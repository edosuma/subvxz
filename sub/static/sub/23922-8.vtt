Good to get out?

02:33.153 --> 02:35.503
That crisp Chicago air.

02:35.546 --> 02:37.722
A mix of car
exhaust and fish.

02:37.766 --> 02:39.289
Nothing quite like it.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.073
You grew up near here,
didn't you, Solomon?

02:41.117 --> 02:42.466
Humboldt Park.

02:42.510 --> 02:43.772
Two blocks from Saul Bellow.

02:43.815 --> 02:45.295
Those were the days
of great men.

02:45.339 --> 02:46.818
Mr. Waltzer.

02:46.862 --> 02:48.211
Good day to be
out and about.

02:48.255 --> 02:49.604
It is.

02:49.647 --> 02:51.475
We should arrange
a conference for after.

02:51.519 --> 02:53.782
Why is that?After our
next witness,

02:53.825 --> 02:55.740
you'll want to settle.

02:55.784 --> 02:58.613
The man that once did
sell the lion's skin

02:58.656 --> 03:02.791
while the beast lived, was
killed with hunting him.

03:17.109 --> 03:19.851
In all, 28 shots were fired.

03:19.895 --> 03:23.072
Eight came from
the Heckler & Koch P30...

03:24.291 --> 03:25.901
...that was found in the hands

03:25.944 --> 03:28.425
of the deceased, Antonio Phelps.

03:29.687 --> 03:31.820
And he was selling
illegal guns at this site?

03:31.863 --> 03:33.213
Yes. This was an undercover
sting operation

03:33.256 --> 03:34.779
to stop the spread
of illegal arms.

03:35.911 --> 03:37.565
And the remaining 20 shots?

03:37.608 --> 03:39.393
They came from
the two Glock 17s carried

03:39.436 --> 03:40.611
by the arriving officers,

03:40.655 --> 03:43.614
there and there.

03:43.658 --> 03:47.183
And was one of the arriving
officers the defendant,

03:47.227 --> 03:48.576
Detective Daniel
Whitehead?

03:49.751 --> 03:51.318
Your Honor.

03:51.361 --> 03:52.971
Yes, Mr. Waltzer

03:53.015 --> 03:56.453
Not an objection,
so much as a clarification.

03:56.497 --> 04:00.805
Detective Whitehead
is oneof the defendants.

04:00.849 --> 04:03.852
The other is
the Chicago Police Department.

04:05.506 --> 04:07.290
That is correct.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.379
Thank you, Mr. Waltzer.
You may continue.

04:09.423 --> 04:14.863
Now let's turn to the actions
of our client, Rashid Clarkson.

04:15.864 --> 04:17.692
Rashid was here undercover.

04:17.735 --> 04:18.693
Yes.

04:18.736 --> 04:21.348
At this marker here.

04:21.391 --> 04:24.786
And isn't it true, Mr. McVeigh,
that Rashid was unarmed?

04:24.829 --> 04:26.831
Yes. According
to the police report.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.703
Why isn't he objecting?

04:28.746 --> 04:30.705
I don't know.

04:30.748 --> 04:35.840
Whenever I've met a legend,
I have been unimpressed.

04:35.884 --> 04:37.842
Was our client injured

04:37.886 --> 04:39.279
in the crossfire?No.

04:39.322 --> 04:40.976
Where was he injured?

04:41.019 --> 04:42.891
The undercover officer,
Rashid Clarkson, was hit here,

04:42.934 --> 04:44.327
during a foot chase.

04:44.371 --> 04:46.286
He was trying to catch
the other suspect.

04:46.329 --> 04:49.550
Yes.Were you able to determine
the gun that was fired

04:49.593 --> 04:51.595
Yes.

04:51.639 --> 04:54.076
It was the Glock 17 carried
by Detective Whitehead.

04:54.119 --> 04:55.773
Were you able to
determine the trajectory

04:55.817 --> 04:57.993
of the rounds that Detective
Whitehead fired at our client?

04:58.036 --> 05:00.387
Factoring in
Detective Whitehead's height,

05:00.430 --> 05:02.911
and the point of aim
to point of impact,

05:02.954 --> 05:07.394
the trajectory was a downward
angle of 15.6 degrees.

05:07.437 --> 05:08.743
Indicating what?

05:08.786 --> 05:11.093
Officer
Rashid Clarkson was

05:11.136 --> 05:13.791
lying prone on the ground
when he was shot.

05:13.835 --> 05:16.228
And so, our client

05:16.272 --> 05:17.447
will never be able
to walk again...

05:17.491 --> 05:18.709
I think
I'll object to that,

05:18.753 --> 05:20.320
And I
will sustain it.

05:20.363 --> 05:22.017
One more question,
Mr. McVeigh,

05:22.060 --> 05:24.498
before the defense
asks you the same thing.

05:24.541 --> 05:28.415
Are you related to anyone
on our plaintiff's legal team?

05:28.458 --> 05:31.287
Yes. I'm married
to Diane Lockhart,

05:31.331 --> 05:32.506
one of your attorneys.

05:32.549 --> 05:34.595
And has this
biased you in any way?

05:34.638 --> 05:36.423
No.
In fact,

05:36.466 --> 05:40.165
have you ever testified on the
other side from Ms. Lockhart?

05:40.209 --> 05:41.558
Yes, on three cases.

05:41.602 --> 05:42.864
Well, that can't
go ever well at home.

05:44.692 --> 05:46.824
Well, we understand that
facts always eclipse emotion.

05:46.868 --> 05:48.826
Thank you, Mr. McVeigh.

05:48.870 --> 05:50.785
Mr. Waltzer, anything?

05:50.828 --> 05:52.613
Yes.

05:52.656 --> 05:55.137
Mr. McVeigh,
have you ever been charged

05:55.180 --> 05:57.269
with perjury in any case?

05:59.489 --> 06:00.882
No, sir.

06:00.925 --> 06:03.537
Okay. Thank you.

06:12.850 --> 06:14.765
Hey, you were great.

06:14.809 --> 06:16.724
Thank you.

06:16.767 --> 06:18.682
I don't think
I should kiss you here.

06:18.726 --> 06:20.162
How about later?

06:20.205 --> 06:21.772
30.

06:21.816 --> 06:24.384
I'll leave the door unlocked.

06:24.427 --> 06:28.257
Hey, uh, you have never been
charged with perjury, right?

06:28.300 --> 06:29.650
Right.

06:31.347 --> 06:33.958
That was a weird cross.
Maybe he's going senile.

06:35.525 --> 06:36.744
Mr. Waltzer.

06:36.787 --> 06:38.398
Why don't you ride with us?

06:38.441 --> 06:40.400
Oh, I'd like that.

06:43.359 --> 06:45.840
8.3 million.

06:45.883 --> 06:47.711
I think we could
accept that.

06:47.755 --> 06:50.279
I was hoping for more, but
I'm feeling sorry for you.

06:50.322 --> 06:51.933
We have a
sympathetic client,

06:51.976 --> 06:56.372
Mr. Waltzer, in a wheelchair,
shot by a racist cop.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.982
If this goes to verdict,

06:58.026 --> 07:00.681
the CPD could end up
paying more than 12 million.

07:00.724 --> 07:03.553
We're offering you a deal.
8.3 now, and we're done.

07:03.597 --> 07:05.468
Thank you, but
I'm enjoying court.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.862
I used to work at a
car wash right there.

07:07.905 --> 07:09.429
$1.25 an hour.

07:09.472 --> 07:13.171
Mr. Waltzer, you do realize
you're losing?

07:13.215 --> 07:16.218
That's what Justice Scalia
said to me in 1991.

07:16.261 --> 07:18.568
One of my strengths is
never knowing I'm losing.

07:22.485 --> 07:25.880
All I ever wanted
was to be a cop.

07:25.923 --> 07:27.708
I'm born and raised
in this city.

07:27.751 --> 07:30.450
I love it.
I wanted to give back.

07:32.495 --> 07:34.454
That was taken from me.

07:34.497 --> 07:36.891
See, I'm 34.

07:36.934 --> 07:38.849
It's not how I expected
my life to go.

07:40.416 --> 07:42.636
Sorry.

07:42.679 --> 07:45.595
Now I can't even
walk my dog.

07:45.639 --> 07:47.118
My wife has to turn
me over in bed.

07:47.162 --> 07:48.816
He's not objecting to anything.

07:48.859 --> 07:50.731
I think you can push this.

07:50.774 --> 07:53.647
Officer Clarkson,
were you familiar

07:53.690 --> 07:57.781
with Detective Whitehead
prior to the shooting?

07:57.825 --> 07:59.479
No.

07:59.522 --> 08:01.350
So why do you think he shot you?

08:01.393 --> 08:03.221
He saw a black face
and decided to shoot.

08:03.265 --> 08:05.136
I was screaming at him

08:05.180 --> 08:08.836
that I was unarmed, that
I was an undercover cop.

08:08.879 --> 08:10.925
I was trying to chase down
one of the suspects.

08:10.968 --> 08:12.230
Had you heard rumors of

08:12.274 --> 08:14.363
Detective Whitehead's racism
before?

08:14.406 --> 08:15.756
Uh, one-one second.

08:15.799 --> 08:20.456
Uh, Mr. Waltzer, uh,
do you want to object to that?

08:20.500 --> 08:23.285
No, thank you, Your Honor.

08:23.328 --> 08:26.114
I trust the jury
to discern what is fact

08:26.157 --> 08:28.377
and what is opinion.

08:30.161 --> 08:32.294
Okay.I heard stories about Whitehead

08:32.337 --> 08:34.078
using drop guns

08:34.122 --> 08:38.126
and going out of his way
to harass black arrestees.

08:38.169 --> 08:40.302
I was told to
watch out for him.

08:40.345 --> 08:41.564
Thank you, Officer.

08:41.608 --> 08:43.044
Uh, Mr. Waltzer?

08:43.087 --> 08:44.785
Yes.

08:51.705 --> 08:52.749
Hello.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.490
Hi.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.711
You mentioned not being able
to walk your dog earlier.

08:57.754 --> 09:00.670
What kind of dog?

09:00.714 --> 09:04.369
A bull terrier. Augustus.

09:04.413 --> 09:06.241
Augustus.

09:06.284 --> 09:09.549
I-- my guess is he wasn't named
after the first Roman emperor.

09:09.592 --> 09:11.768
No, a friend.SOLOMON: I see.

09:11.812 --> 09:13.596
And you still have Augustus?

09:13.640 --> 09:15.598
Your Honor, objection.
Relevance.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.905
Your Honor, I didn't bring up
the dog, the witness did.

09:17.948 --> 09:19.602
I'm just getting
a fuller picture.Okay.

09:19.646 --> 09:22.213
I have no idea
where this is going,

09:22.257 --> 09:24.128
but overruled.

09:24.172 --> 09:26.304
So do you still have Augustus?

09:26.348 --> 09:29.394
No. He died a few months back.

09:29.438 --> 09:30.657
I see.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.180
And what did he die of?

09:32.223 --> 09:34.356
It was
natural causes.

09:34.399 --> 09:35.575
He got old.

09:35.618 --> 09:36.706
Big dogs have
a harder time.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.099
So are you saying
he died naturally?

09:38.142 --> 09:41.493
Or do you mean he was put down?

09:41.537 --> 09:43.887
Uh, he was put down.
I see.

09:43.931 --> 09:45.497
And a veterinarian did this?

09:45.541 --> 09:47.543
Yes.And it wasn't
done illegally,

09:47.587 --> 09:49.806
after an injury
from a dog fight?

09:49.850 --> 09:51.416
Objection, Your Honor.

09:51.460 --> 09:53.331
Relevance. Not in evidence.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.029
I think the relevance
will become clear, Your Honor.

09:55.072 --> 09:57.031
Um, get to the point,

09:57.074 --> 09:58.859
Mr. Waltzer.

09:58.902 --> 10:02.863
Officer Clarkson,
in June of 2014,

10:02.906 --> 10:04.473
didn't Internal Affairs

10:04.516 --> 10:08.477
investigate reports that
you were conducting dog fights

10:08.520 --> 10:10.044
Objection, Your Honor.after complaints

10:10.087 --> 10:11.741
by Jean Bibb, a neighbor?Objection.

10:11.785 --> 10:13.047
Objection!

10:13.090 --> 10:14.657
Your Honor,

10:14.701 --> 10:15.832
this line of questioning
is meant purely

10:15.876 --> 10:17.138
to disparage our client.

10:17.181 --> 10:18.443
There is no evidence
of this, Your Honor.

10:18.487 --> 10:19.749
And even if there were,

10:19.793 --> 10:21.359
it would have no connection
to this shooting.

10:21.403 --> 10:23.361
Sorry, Your Honor,
if I could speak?

10:23.405 --> 10:25.276
I'm not used to
this new way of debate

10:25.320 --> 10:26.713
where the loudest voice wins.

10:26.756 --> 10:28.366
Go ahead.

10:28.410 --> 10:29.933
I think any Internal Affairs
investigation

10:29.977 --> 10:31.805
has a direct bearing
on this case.

10:31.848 --> 10:33.023
That is not true.

10:33.067 --> 10:34.416
Mr. Boseman. Shh.

10:34.459 --> 10:36.592
Where is the evidence
of this investigation?

10:36.636 --> 10:38.376
My paralegal found
an article referring

10:38.420 --> 10:40.291
to a leaked I.A. report.

10:40.335 --> 10:41.989
I'm subpoenaing the department

10:42.032 --> 10:44.165
even as we speak.Okay. I want evidence

10:44.208 --> 10:45.601
brought to me by tomorrow
morning, and I'll rule

10:45.645 --> 10:46.820
on the admissibility
of this questioning.

10:46.863 --> 10:48.691
The bell has already
been rung, Your Honor.

10:48.735 --> 10:50.084
And if there
is no evidence,

10:50.127 --> 10:52.826
we will unring it;
that is all I can offer.

10:54.262 --> 10:57.091
Come on, man, it's not true.

10:57.134 --> 10:59.702
How didyour dog die?

10:59.746 --> 11:01.356
Exactly as I said.
He was getting old.

11:01.399 --> 11:03.097
Look, I'm not lying.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.359
Could this neighbor,

11:04.402 --> 11:06.361
Mrs. Bibb, have been lying?

11:06.404 --> 11:08.189
I don't even have a neighbor.
We live out in the country.

11:08.232 --> 11:09.930
Okay. Jay,
check if there are

11:09.973 --> 11:11.888
any Internal Affairs reports
we don't know about.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.934
And, Marissa,

11:13.977 --> 11:16.893
you check if there's any news
reporting on this at all.

11:16.937 --> 11:18.939
♪

11:29.427 --> 11:31.168
Who are you visiting?Craig Savador, please.

11:56.193 --> 11:58.761
So, hey.

11:58.805 --> 12:00.763
Hey.

12:05.681 --> 12:08.118
Let's see this.

12:09.250 --> 12:10.555
Dope.

12:10.599 --> 12:11.687
Okay.

12:12.906 --> 12:14.734
This is Basquiat-level dope.

12:14.777 --> 12:16.866
Yeah, I took what you did
and riffed off it a bit.

12:16.910 --> 12:19.434
Oh, so, y-you jocking
my style now, huh?

12:19.477 --> 12:20.652
You wish.

12:20.696 --> 12:22.045
That's classic Boondocks.

12:22.089 --> 12:23.786
I'm just taking it
to another level.

12:23.830 --> 12:26.223
Hey.
Ah.

12:26.267 --> 12:27.659
Now it's your move.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.756
So what up? Talk to me.

12:36.799 --> 12:39.280
It's looking good.

12:39.323 --> 12:41.151
I heard that before.

12:41.195 --> 12:42.762
It's different
this time.

12:42.805 --> 12:45.503
I heard that before, too.

12:45.547 --> 12:48.115
I think some stuff
is about to drop in court

12:48.158 --> 12:49.725
that can help your appeal.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.858
But your firm don't know
anything about me.

12:51.901 --> 12:53.033
No.

12:53.076 --> 12:54.599
That doesn't matter.

12:54.643 --> 12:56.471
There's damning stuff
about Whitehead.

12:56.514 --> 12:58.821
And his use
of drop guns.

13:00.867 --> 13:03.304
Uh... you serious?

13:03.347 --> 13:05.828
Yeah. Call your lawyer.

13:05.872 --> 13:08.004
Tell him to get to court
and use what we're getting

13:08.048 --> 13:09.266
on the record.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.184
Hey.

13:17.666 --> 13:19.842
What do you think?
Oh.

13:19.886 --> 13:22.584
I think Solomon knows
he has a losing case,

13:22.627 --> 13:25.369
and he wants to distract us
as well as the jury.

13:25.413 --> 13:27.763
He doesn't have the facts
on his side.
Right.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.635
So he wants us
chasing our tails.

13:30.679 --> 13:33.682
And here we are,
chasing our tails.

13:33.725 --> 13:35.379
Yeah.
Where you going?

13:35.423 --> 13:37.512
Oh, uh, court.

13:37.555 --> 13:39.122
For what?

13:39.166 --> 13:41.777
Oh, I-I just--
I promised someone.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.170
Who?

13:43.213 --> 13:45.433
Do you mind if
I don't answer that?

13:45.476 --> 13:47.827
It's-it's really--
It's not a big deal.

13:52.092 --> 13:55.617
Thank you... for all, uh,
joining me here today.

13:55.660 --> 13:58.054
I'm, Judge Trig Mullaney,
a new appointee here.

13:58.098 --> 14:00.056
And...

14:00.100 --> 14:01.666
Oh, of course.

14:01.710 --> 14:03.277
Thank you.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.105
Cleanup on aisle seven.

14:06.541 --> 14:08.804
I'm Judge, uh...
I'm Judge Trig Mulla--

14:08.848 --> 14:10.240
I'm Judge Trig Mullaney,

Uh, and I will be
your judge today,

14:14.636 --> 14:17.030

What should I call you?
My arrestees.

14:23.993 --> 14:25.038
You made it.

14:25.081 --> 14:26.822
Yeah. I said I would.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.216
I think I'm fucked.
This guy's a Trump appointee.

14:29.259 --> 14:30.913
All right, just
follow my lead,

14:30.957 --> 14:32.436
and don't say
anything radical.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.569
Oh, like we need to
assassinate the president?

14:34.612 --> 14:36.136
No, don't even joke
about that.

14:36.179 --> 14:38.181
Let's just take this
one thing at a time here.

14:38.225 --> 14:40.618
Uh, you, at the...
at the thing there.

14:40.662 --> 14:42.925
The lectern, Your Honor.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.057
The lectern, yes.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.537
You are with...

14:46.581 --> 14:48.017
Who are you with?

The Department of Justice.Of Justice, yes.

14:49.540 --> 14:50.890
AUSA Monica Timmons.

14:50.933 --> 14:52.674
Good. Good.

14:52.717 --> 14:55.285
And, uh, you--
contestant number one.

14:55.329 --> 14:58.158
Come on down.

14:58.201 --> 15:01.291
I am Diane Lockhart,
representing Tully Nelson.

15:01.335 --> 15:03.250
Okay.

15:03.293 --> 15:05.339
Wh-- And what are
the accusations?

15:05.382 --> 15:07.776
The charges, Your Honor?
Mr. Tully's charged with

15:07.819 --> 15:09.647
incitement to riot
and resisting arrest.

15:09.691 --> 15:10.866
Application for release

15:10.910 --> 15:12.259
on the defendant's
own recognizance.

15:12.302 --> 15:14.304
Government opposes.

15:16.654 --> 15:19.483
Okay.

15:21.311 --> 15:23.792
Thank you. That's fine.

15:23.835 --> 15:26.099
Shh. Thank you.

15:26.142 --> 15:28.492
Thanks. I'm gonna need
a moment to think on that.

15:28.536 --> 15:29.929
Um...

15:29.972 --> 15:32.540
ponder it, you know.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.542
Conjugate.

15:34.585 --> 15:36.152
Your Honor,

15:36.196 --> 15:39.764
...bail is customarily set,

15:39.808 --> 15:41.766
even in Class A felonies.

15:41.810 --> 15:44.595
Yeah. Yep, well...

15:44.639 --> 15:48.556
in my court, we do not follow,
you know... customary things.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.297
The court should know
that we will be filing

15:50.340 --> 15:51.733
an interlocutory appeal

15:51.776 --> 15:53.474
on this ruling--

15:53.517 --> 15:56.129
and that's not
a good thing--

15:56.172 --> 15:58.522
unless bail is granted.

15:58.566 --> 16:01.003
Your Honor,

16:01.047 --> 16:02.526
the government
supports detention because

16:02.570 --> 16:04.137
the defendant is a flight risk.

16:04.180 --> 16:05.747
The crime involved

16:05.790 --> 16:07.749
destruction of property.

16:07.792 --> 16:10.012
At a post office.It did, huh?

16:10.056 --> 16:11.622
Without bail, Your Honor,

16:11.666 --> 16:13.842
we will be asking you
to honor the Daubert standard.

16:13.885 --> 16:15.757
Your Honor, the Daubert
standard has nothing to do...

16:15.800 --> 16:16.888
Whether it's res judicata

16:16.932 --> 16:19.152
or stare decisis,
there is no basis

16:19.195 --> 16:20.718
for imposing some

16:20.762 --> 16:24.026
Draconian policy with regard
to bail nunc pro tunc.

16:24.070 --> 16:26.115
Your Honor, the defense is now
just making up words.

16:26.159 --> 16:27.595
Excuse me.
You insult His Honor.

16:27.638 --> 16:29.031
I think he knows
the difference

16:29.075 --> 16:31.251
between a legal standard
and a lawyerly trick.

16:37.126 --> 16:38.998
God, that was intense!
Oh...

16:39.041 --> 16:41.391
Listen, you need to get
a permanent lawyer, Tully.

16:41.435 --> 16:44.090
No, the way that played
in there, you are my attorney.

16:44.133 --> 16:47.006
No, I can't.

16:47.049 --> 16:50.531
Listen, you can't say
what you said in court.

16:50.574 --> 16:52.054
Not even in jest.

16:52.098 --> 16:53.795
Oh, you mean about
assassinating the president.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.057
Tully, don't.

16:55.101 --> 16:57.320
It was a joke, that's all.

16:57.364 --> 17:01.063
But you know what's not?
Something's gotta give.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.847
Meaning?

17:02.891 --> 17:04.371
In the streets.

17:04.414 --> 17:07.026
Oh, God.

17:07.069 --> 17:08.766
I-I don't enjoy
destroying things,

17:08.810 --> 17:11.508
but it's the only language
some people understand.

17:11.552 --> 17:14.946
It is fake news until
someone bloodies their noses.

17:16.470 --> 17:19.255
Tully, don't make me regret
getting you out.

17:19.299 --> 17:20.387

20:00.155 --> 20:01.983
Yeah.
Why?

You are smart.

20:34.102 --> 20:35.495
It's called
microtargeting.

20:35.538 --> 20:37.453
Sites like Facebook
offer it to advertisers

20:37.497 --> 20:39.107
to refine their ad dollars.

20:39.150 --> 20:40.500
It was weaponized
by the Russians

20:40.543 --> 20:41.979
during the last election.

20:42.023 --> 20:44.243
They could target

against our jurors?

20:48.856 --> 20:50.292
Yep, through
their Facebook pages.

20:50.336 --> 20:52.773
And they can really
target just 12 people?

20:52.816 --> 20:54.427
No, but they can

20:54.470 --> 20:56.994
target people with the same
characteristics as the jurors.

20:57.038 --> 20:58.561
Take juror number ten.

20:58.605 --> 21:02.261
He's an African-American man
living in Chicago.

21:02.304 --> 21:06.308
There are 500,000 men who share those characteristics.

21:06.352 --> 21:08.963
But he's also a fan
of Brazilian soccer.

21:09.006 --> 21:12.793
That narrows it down
to 58,000.

21:12.836 --> 21:15.317
He also subscribes
toThe New York Times.

21:15.361 --> 21:17.667
That narrows it down to

21:17.711 --> 21:19.669
1,489 men.

21:19.713 --> 21:21.367
So, you keep refining it

21:21.410 --> 21:24.021
down and down to a group
of 1,000 or so people,

21:24.065 --> 21:26.415

How do we know this was done
to our jurors?

21:30.376 --> 21:32.116
We created the same profile.

21:32.160 --> 21:36.991
We put in all the same
characteristics as our jurors.

21:37.034 --> 21:39.167
And here is an article
that was pumped into

21:39.210 --> 21:41.082

21:41.125 --> 21:44.955
"Police Investigate
CPD Cop for Dog Fights."

Oh, my God.
Yep.

21:46.392 --> 21:48.132
It's an article
that mentions Rashid

21:48.176 --> 21:49.743
and everything asked in court.

21:49.786 --> 21:51.222
There's more.

21:51.266 --> 21:53.007
"Trial Ends in Hung Jury."

21:53.050 --> 21:54.617
What's that about?

21:54.661 --> 21:57.359
A murder case,
but, uh, it mentions-- Sorry.

21:57.403 --> 21:58.447
Thank you.

21:58.491 --> 22:01.058
It mentions that
the trial turned

being accused

22:04.714 --> 22:05.933
of perjury.

22:05.976 --> 22:08.283
Kurt.Yeah.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.980
None of it.

22:10.024 --> 22:11.721
It's fake news.Can this be traced

22:11.765 --> 22:13.114
to the defense lawyer?

22:13.157 --> 22:14.985
No. It's all anonymous.

22:15.029 --> 22:16.770
He can create
a fictional news service

22:16.813 --> 22:18.337
with fictional articles,

22:18.380 --> 22:20.513
and we have no way
to know who did it.

22:22.428 --> 22:24.386
He's using those articles
to undercut us.

22:24.430 --> 22:26.388
So we show it to the judge.

22:26.432 --> 22:28.434
It doesn't matter
if it's anonymous.

22:28.477 --> 22:31.524
Clearly, Solomon is
the one who benefits.

22:31.567 --> 22:34.744
So, this is fake news?

22:34.788 --> 22:36.833
It's more than fake news,

your information, Mr. Waltzer?

22:39.706 --> 22:41.098
It is not just

22:41.142 --> 22:42.926
the dog fights, Your Honor.

22:42.970 --> 22:45.059
It's also the accusations
of perjury

22:45.102 --> 22:47.191
against our
expert witness.

22:47.235 --> 22:49.368
Again, Your Honor, I'd rather
not talk over everybody.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.152
Mr. Boseman,

22:51.195 --> 22:52.153
wait.

22:52.196 --> 22:53.502
Where did this come from?

22:53.546 --> 22:54.982
I don't know, Your Honor.

22:55.025 --> 22:57.201
Came from a paralegal,
and he's since been dismissed.

22:57.245 --> 22:58.551
This is bullshit.

22:58.594 --> 22:59.856
Stop.
I mean...

22:59.900 --> 23:03.120
So, what is your
requested remedy, a mistrial?

23:03.164 --> 23:06.776
No. The same tactic can be used
against a new jury.

23:06.820 --> 23:08.778
And you happen to like
this jury?

23:08.822 --> 23:10.563
That has nothing to do with it.

23:10.606 --> 23:11.651
Look, I can instruct the jury

23:11.694 --> 23:13.392
to, uh, ignore
its Facebook feed...

23:13.435 --> 23:15.785
Which will have the exact
opposite effect, Your Honor.

23:15.829 --> 23:18.658
The first thing they'll do is
go check their Facebook feeds.

23:18.701 --> 23:20.050
So you want me to ignore this?

23:20.094 --> 23:22.139
No, we ask that you
censure the defense

23:22.183 --> 23:23.445
for employing
these tactics.

23:23.489 --> 23:24.968
These are not
my tactics, Your Honor.

23:25.012 --> 23:26.622
I must admit to being

23:26.666 --> 23:28.102
a bit of a luddite.

23:28.145 --> 23:30.365
None of this Facebook business
makes much sense to me.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.498
Your Honor, one of the
microtargeted articles

23:32.541 --> 23:36.197
reports that our firm was
prosecuted for stealing money.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.286
And that I was prosecuted
for sexual harassment.

23:38.329 --> 23:40.897
I understand your outrage,
but we have no way

23:40.941 --> 23:42.725
to trace this back
to the defense.

23:42.769 --> 23:44.510
Then we ask that we be
allowed to question

23:44.553 --> 23:47.382
an I.T. specialist
on how microtargeting is used.

23:47.426 --> 23:48.601
I will instruct the jury
to ignore

23:48.644 --> 23:49.950
any references
to dog fights or perjury,

23:49.993 --> 23:52.996
but I will not bias them
against Mr. Waltzer.

23:53.040 --> 23:55.912
Now, can we please
have the jury come in?

23:55.956 --> 23:57.653
What about a mistrial?

23:57.697 --> 24:00.264
No. The jury likes
the ballistics.

24:00.308 --> 24:02.528
Let me try something.

24:02.571 --> 24:03.790
Jay.

24:12.538 --> 24:14.496
Solomon's acting
like an old fool,

24:14.540 --> 24:16.498
but he's the one behind
the microtargeting.

24:16.542 --> 24:20.154
Yeah, I agree.
What do you need?

24:20.197 --> 24:22.069
He's doing it
anonymously,

24:22.112 --> 24:25.333
so there's no way to
trace it back to him.

24:25.376 --> 24:27.466
Or to anybody.

24:29.511 --> 24:32.819
And this is not something
I can ask you to do, Jay.

24:32.862 --> 24:35.865
I can only
tell you...

24:35.909 --> 24:38.346
what I wish
would happen.

24:38.389 --> 24:40.261
I'm on it.

24:46.702 --> 24:48.835
What are you doing?

24:48.878 --> 24:50.489
Typing.

24:50.532 --> 24:54.144
Ah. Fictional
news service.

24:54.188 --> 24:56.582
Making fake news,
are we?

24:56.625 --> 24:59.976
So, are we writing something
about Solomon Waltzer?

25:00.020 --> 25:01.804
Caught with child porn
or something?

25:01.848 --> 25:04.459
Wearen't doing anything.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.288
Where are the
juror rundowns?

25:07.331 --> 25:10.987
Uh... right there.

25:28.875 --> 25:30.267
Jay Dipersia's phone.

25:30.311 --> 25:31.834
This is a collect call

25:31.878 --> 25:33.967
from Danville
Correctional Center.

25:34.010 --> 25:35.403
Will you accept the charges?

25:35.446 --> 25:36.752
Definitely.

25:36.796 --> 25:38.319
Hey, Jay, it's me.

25:38.362 --> 25:40.756
Actually, this is Marissa.
I work with Jay.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.628
Oh, hey, hey.

25:42.671 --> 25:45.021
Could you tell him
I called my lawyer,

25:45.065 --> 25:47.328
and he's sick, like, chemo sick.

25:47.371 --> 25:49.112
I need to find
a new lawyer fast.

25:49.156 --> 25:50.287
I mean, like, today.

25:50.331 --> 25:51.593
Okay. Uh, here he is.

25:51.637 --> 25:54.378
It's for you.
Someone in prison.

25:57.904 --> 26:00.036
Uh...

26:02.038 --> 26:03.997
Okay.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.476
I'll see what I can do.

26:14.877 --> 26:16.531
Who was that?

26:16.575 --> 26:18.185
A friend.

26:18.228 --> 26:20.143
He needs a lawyer?

26:20.187 --> 26:23.538
Uh-huh.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.062
If only we knew some.

26:26.106 --> 26:28.499
I'd rather have you
not tell anyone.

26:28.543 --> 26:30.763
Why?
This is my thing.

26:30.806 --> 26:33.243
Your friend is a thing?

26:33.287 --> 26:34.636
I've been pursuing this
for a while.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.290
The firm won't understand.

26:36.333 --> 26:38.640
Okay, but Maia and Lucca might.

26:38.684 --> 26:42.905
If your friend needs a lawyer,
Maia and Lucca could do it.

26:44.994 --> 26:46.343
So you've been in
for two years?

26:46.387 --> 26:48.258
Yes, for trafficking.

26:48.302 --> 26:50.783
5,000 grams of marijuana
with the intent to distribute.

26:50.826 --> 26:52.436
It's a Class X felony.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.961
But with the minimum,
that would be three years.

26:55.004 --> 26:56.353
Except with a firearm present.

26:56.397 --> 26:57.659
That's why he's serving
15 years.

26:57.703 --> 26:59.443
Only problem is

26:59.487 --> 27:00.531
I-I didn't have a gun.

27:00.575 --> 27:02.882
And you blame
Detective Whitehead?

27:02.925 --> 27:04.927
Yeah.

27:04.971 --> 27:07.669
That's why this accusation in
the civil case is so important.

27:07.713 --> 27:10.280
He's accused of using
drop guns in other cases.

27:10.324 --> 27:13.457
It's a civil case and it's just
a charge at this point,

27:13.501 --> 27:15.851
so I'm not sure if that
will help with the appeal.

27:15.895 --> 27:18.506
We're putting Whitehead
on the stand, right?

27:18.549 --> 27:19.855
Yes.

27:19.899 --> 27:21.552
Let's get him under oath.

27:21.596 --> 27:22.771
No, we can't be using
our civil case

27:22.815 --> 27:23.990
to help with this criminal case.

27:24.033 --> 27:25.121
That's how firms
get into trouble.

27:25.165 --> 27:27.297
No. Both cases help each other.

27:27.341 --> 27:30.039
Jay, you need
to tell the partners

27:30.083 --> 27:32.041
that's why you brought
Rashid's case to the firm.

27:32.085 --> 27:33.608
You have an agenda.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.523
My agenda doesn't matter here.

27:35.566 --> 27:37.394
How many months pregnant?

27:40.833 --> 27:43.923
Um, I'm seven months.

27:43.966 --> 27:46.490
You-you look good.

27:46.534 --> 27:47.927
My girlfriend was pregnant

27:47.970 --> 27:49.493
when I was sentenced.

27:49.537 --> 27:51.191
I have a son now. Roy.

27:53.584 --> 27:56.805
Okay.

27:56.849 --> 27:58.807
Look, we'll do
the best we can.

27:58.851 --> 28:00.461
We'll file an appeal

28:00.504 --> 28:02.115
and ask for the case
to be reopened

28:02.158 --> 28:03.551
based on new information.

28:03.594 --> 28:06.206
Thank you.

28:06.249 --> 28:09.731
Okay.

28:09.775 --> 28:12.691
So, we are going to have a trial
at some point, right?

28:12.734 --> 28:14.605
The defense is ready,
Your Honor,

28:14.649 --> 28:15.998
and has been for some time.

28:16.042 --> 28:17.608
Your Honor,
we've been following

28:17.652 --> 28:20.655
these Facebook feeds
targeted at our jurors.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.352
Targeted,
but not necessarily read.

28:22.396 --> 28:25.660
Yes, but unfortunately,
this new article we just found

28:25.704 --> 28:27.053
worries us.

28:27.096 --> 28:28.228
Why is that?

28:28.271 --> 28:29.577
It's about you.

28:29.620 --> 28:31.797
Really?

28:31.840 --> 28:35.757
So, wh-what-what does it say?

28:35.801 --> 28:38.151
It refers to you
as a "Muslim judge."

28:38.194 --> 28:40.109
Well, I am a convert,
so it has that right.

28:40.153 --> 28:42.895
Well, the headline says,
"Muslim Judge

28:42.938 --> 28:44.940
Makes Questionable
Donation."

28:44.984 --> 28:46.594
Really?

28:46.637 --> 28:48.422
What-what donation did I make?

28:50.424 --> 28:52.426
$120,000 to ISIS.

28:52.469 --> 28:54.733
Your Honor, again,

28:54.776 --> 28:57.387
the defense has nothing to do
with these fake news articles.

28:59.259 --> 29:02.044
Microtargeting is a way
to direct information

29:02.088 --> 29:04.264
and misinformation
towards Facebook

29:04.307 --> 29:06.005
and other social
media users.

29:06.048 --> 29:07.441
So, it can use profiles

29:07.484 --> 29:09.660
provided in the
jury selection?

29:09.704 --> 29:11.314
That's right.
It's very simple.

29:11.358 --> 29:15.057
You can target a specific group,
like-like you jurors,

29:15.101 --> 29:17.799
with fake news and ads.

29:17.843 --> 29:19.975
Hmm. Fake news.

29:20.019 --> 29:21.803
Like articles about

29:21.847 --> 29:23.370
the plaintiff
conducting dog fights?

29:23.413 --> 29:25.676
Exactly.
And in this way,

29:25.720 --> 29:27.983
the whole world doesn't
see the faked article,

29:28.027 --> 29:31.073
just the small group
you want to target.

29:31.117 --> 29:34.729
So, you microtargeted that
article about the judge?

29:34.773 --> 29:36.426
Oh, we thought you did.

29:36.470 --> 29:38.211
You know I didn't.

29:38.254 --> 29:42.389
Oh, of course, because
you're too much of a luddite.

29:42.432 --> 29:44.783
So, this is
all-out war now?

29:44.826 --> 29:46.828
Alas, yes.

29:46.872 --> 29:50.397
It was almost better when
I thought you were senile.

29:50.440 --> 29:53.052
"Do not let me hear
the wisdom of old men,

29:53.095 --> 29:55.445
but only of their folly."

29:55.489 --> 29:58.492
"Their fear of
fear and frenzy,

29:58.535 --> 30:00.494
their fear of possession."

30:11.548 --> 30:13.202
Marissa,
what do you got?

30:13.246 --> 30:14.377
Where-where is,
where is Jay?

30:14.421 --> 30:15.988
I don't know.

30:16.031 --> 30:18.164
I think I know where
Solomon Waltzer's going next.

30:18.207 --> 30:19.556
What do you mean, "going next"?

30:19.600 --> 30:21.341
I've been following
the microtargeted articles

30:21.384 --> 30:23.343
to see where the defense will go
in their next attack.

30:23.386 --> 30:24.735
And where is that?

30:24.779 --> 30:27.347
There are three articles
questioning

30:27.390 --> 30:28.870
Kurt McVeigh's
reputation.

30:28.914 --> 30:30.263
Yup. They're going
after our strengths.

30:30.306 --> 30:32.395
Ballistics.

30:34.441 --> 30:37.444
Where is Kurt vulnerable?

30:39.925 --> 30:41.927
I don't know.

30:41.970 --> 30:43.667
What are the articles saying?

30:43.711 --> 30:47.193
Um, maybe you should
just read it.

30:47.236 --> 30:49.804
No, you read it.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.459
That he cheated on you.

30:52.502 --> 30:54.026
Oh, Jesus.

30:54.069 --> 30:55.592
He's turning it
into a soap opera.

30:55.636 --> 30:58.769
So we prep Kurt
on all the questions.

30:58.813 --> 31:00.249
He's good on the stand.

31:00.293 --> 31:02.469
You stay out of court.No.

31:02.512 --> 31:05.472
Diane, the jury will be looking
at you to see your reaction.

31:05.515 --> 31:08.518
So? I won't react.

31:08.562 --> 31:10.694
Can you not?

31:10.738 --> 31:14.394
I can not.

31:21.967 --> 31:23.969
You sure
you're all right?

31:24.012 --> 31:25.405
Cool as a cucumber.

31:25.448 --> 31:27.233
Your Honor,
we would like to call

31:27.276 --> 31:29.539
our first witness,
but I must apologize.

31:29.583 --> 31:31.759
We've had to replace
our ballistics expert

31:31.802 --> 31:33.543
at the last minute.Objection, Your Honor.

31:33.587 --> 31:34.718
Witness was not disclosed

31:34.762 --> 31:36.024
prior to trial.

31:36.068 --> 31:37.896
Our expert witness
was taken sick.

31:37.939 --> 31:39.593
It's merely a replacement.

31:39.636 --> 31:41.508
I'll allow. Don't worry.

31:41.551 --> 31:43.162
You'll-you'll be given time
to prepare.

31:43.205 --> 31:44.337
Go ahead, Mr. Waltzer.

31:44.380 --> 31:45.816
We call Holly Westfall.

31:50.169 --> 31:51.692
What?

31:51.735 --> 31:55.435
Yup. We're deep
in soap opera territory.

31:58.612 --> 32:02.224
According to the
plaintiff's expert, Mr. McVeigh,

32:02.268 --> 32:04.270
the angle of the bullet

32:04.313 --> 32:06.011
that resulted
in the plaintiff's injury

32:06.054 --> 32:08.622
was 15.6 degrees.

32:08.665 --> 32:10.363
First of all,
do you agree with that?

32:10.406 --> 32:12.147
No, unfortunately.

32:12.191 --> 32:14.758
And do...

32:14.802 --> 32:16.760
Why do you say "unfortunately"?

32:16.804 --> 32:19.459
Well, because I have
deep respect for Mr. McVeigh.

32:19.502 --> 32:21.113
I just think
he's wrong on this.

32:21.156 --> 32:22.679
I see.
So, you-you don't

32:22.723 --> 32:25.291
think Rashid was lying
on the ground

32:25.334 --> 32:27.162
in front of the warehouse
when he was shot?

32:27.206 --> 32:29.469
No. From my analysis,
he was hit

32:29.512 --> 32:32.167
in the crossfire in the
salvage yard warehouse earlier.

32:32.211 --> 32:34.996
I see.
Now, Ms. Westfall,

32:35.040 --> 32:37.042
you know Mr. McVeigh personally,

32:37.085 --> 32:38.478
is that correct?

32:38.521 --> 32:40.045
Kurt McVeigh was
my ballistics professor

32:40.088 --> 32:41.437
at one time.

32:41.481 --> 32:43.135
And did he ever
share with you

32:43.178 --> 32:45.789
his approach
to persuading a jury?

32:45.833 --> 32:48.792
Yes. He believes in taking the
jury to the scene of the crime

32:48.836 --> 32:50.751
because it makes
more of an impression.

32:50.794 --> 32:53.667
It can also bolster your
credibility as an expert

32:53.710 --> 32:56.278
and make it more likely
that you can persuade them.

32:56.322 --> 32:58.585
And did he tell you all this
in the classroom?

32:58.628 --> 33:00.891
No.

33:00.935 --> 33:03.546
I see.
Where did he tell you this?

33:03.590 --> 33:05.244
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance?

33:05.287 --> 33:06.680
It helps the jury gauge

33:06.723 --> 33:08.116
the value of the statement,
Your Honor.

33:08.160 --> 33:10.031
Overruled.

33:10.075 --> 33:14.427
No, it wasn't in the classroom.

33:14.470 --> 33:16.168
It was in a private setting.

33:16.211 --> 33:18.039
What kind of
a private setting?

33:18.083 --> 33:20.215
Again, objection, Your Honor,
as to relevance.

33:20.259 --> 33:22.652
Ms. Westfall, you've been told
to answer the question.

33:25.916 --> 33:29.920
I had a relationship
with Mr. McVeigh,

33:29.964 --> 33:31.705
and he shared this
with me then.

33:31.748 --> 33:33.098
In bed?

33:33.141 --> 33:34.708
Your Honor,
I would really prefer

33:34.751 --> 33:36.797
It goes
to Ms. Westfall's

33:36.840 --> 33:38.364
knowledge of Mr. McVeigh.

33:38.407 --> 33:41.758
You are, uh...

33:41.802 --> 33:44.370
you're under oath, Ms. Westfall.

33:48.591 --> 33:50.898
Yes, I believe it was in bed.

33:50.941 --> 33:52.943
You believe that
Mr. McVeigh still has these

33:52.987 --> 33:55.859
same beliefs and concerns,
though, isn't that right?

33:55.903 --> 33:57.122
Yes.

33:57.165 --> 33:58.775
And why is that?

33:58.819 --> 34:02.344
Uh, because we've discussed
cases since then.

34:02.388 --> 34:05.304
At ballistics conferences?

34:05.347 --> 34:06.740
No.

34:06.783 --> 34:08.350
Where then?

34:08.394 --> 34:12.093
We still socialize.
We get drinks sometimes.

34:12.137 --> 34:14.791
And you have no reason
to believe that Mr. McVeigh

34:14.835 --> 34:18.143
would not tell you what he was
thinking and feeling?

34:18.186 --> 34:21.146
I've never known him
to lie to me.

34:25.759 --> 34:28.066
So, what can you tell us?

34:30.764 --> 34:32.461
Nothing.

34:32.505 --> 34:35.247
Holly Westfall's really
damaged your credibility.

34:35.290 --> 34:36.683
We need to damage hers.

34:36.726 --> 34:38.163
I understand that.

34:38.206 --> 34:40.252
I'll offer testimony
on ballistics.

34:40.295 --> 34:42.036
That's what I do.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.517
Nothing personal.

34:44.560 --> 34:46.345
Your relationship

34:46.388 --> 34:49.348
with Ms. Westfall
can ruin this whole case.

34:49.391 --> 34:51.001
That is personal.

34:51.045 --> 34:54.614
Could you give us a minute?

35:06.800 --> 35:08.932
I need your help
on this.

35:08.976 --> 35:11.370
The jury was
convinced by her.

35:11.413 --> 35:13.546
I know.

35:16.592 --> 35:20.292
We need something about her
from your perspective.

35:20.335 --> 35:21.597
I can't do that.

35:21.641 --> 35:22.772
Well, she did it.

35:22.816 --> 35:26.167
Doesn't matter.

35:26.211 --> 35:29.736
So, you're loyal...

35:29.779 --> 35:31.216
to her?

35:31.259 --> 35:32.391
I wouldn't put it that way.

35:32.434 --> 35:34.219
No

35:34.262 --> 35:38.092
Not to my firm,
not to my client...

35:38.136 --> 35:39.485
not to me.

35:39.528 --> 35:41.313
Hold on.You don't kiss and tell?

35:41.356 --> 35:42.749
Is that it?

35:42.792 --> 35:44.620
That would be disloyal?Diane.

35:44.664 --> 35:46.709
Don't you fucking
come any closer to me!

35:46.753 --> 35:47.884
I had a drink with her.Not another word.

35:47.928 --> 35:48.885
Just hear me out.
No.

35:48.929 --> 35:50.322
I will not be that wife.

35:50.365 --> 35:51.975
Who said that?

35:52.019 --> 35:54.543
I don't want to hear
a story about how she called

35:54.587 --> 35:56.197
or you ran into her...I did.

35:56.241 --> 35:57.633
...or you didn't mention it
because it didn't mean anything.

35:57.677 --> 35:58.808
It didn't.

35:58.852 --> 36:02.334
You lied, Kurt!It wasn't like that.

36:02.377 --> 36:03.813
I'm not that woman.

36:05.728 --> 36:07.730
I will not do this.

36:20.700 --> 36:23.485
Hey. I know you.

36:23.529 --> 36:25.183
The funeral.
Right.

36:25.226 --> 36:27.185
Right. People were
dying on you.

36:27.228 --> 36:30.231
They still are.

36:30.275 --> 36:32.842
Yeah. People disappoint.

36:32.886 --> 36:34.409
What are you drinking?

36:34.453 --> 36:37.325
Oh, um, red wine.

36:37.369 --> 36:39.240
California Cabernet?

36:39.284 --> 36:41.721
Sure. Whatever.

36:41.764 --> 36:43.853
Actually, I asked our partner,

36:43.897 --> 36:46.856
who hired you for,
for that reception,

36:46.900 --> 36:48.162
where she found you.

36:48.206 --> 36:49.424
That's why I'm here.

36:49.468 --> 36:52.122
Because I am
just that charming.

36:54.168 --> 36:56.431
I can pay.

36:56.475 --> 36:59.086
No, I do it for friends.

36:59.129 --> 37:02.045
Hmm. And am I a friend?

37:02.089 --> 37:05.484
♪ And people like me, uh...

37:12.882 --> 37:14.275
Friend's advice?

Don't get addicted?
No.

Actually, yes.

Why the Beretta?

38:17.033 --> 38:19.079
Oh, you know guns?

38:19.122 --> 38:20.515
This is not a gun.
It's a pistol.

38:20.559 --> 38:22.300
And I know it's illegal

38:22.343 --> 38:25.433
to modify the milsurp magazine

Why are you carrying?Protection.

I don't like guns, but...
these are dangerous times.

38:39.055 --> 38:41.362
Tell me what you said
in court was a joke.

38:41.406 --> 38:43.538
Why?

38:43.582 --> 38:47.368
You don't believe
in regime change?

38:47.412 --> 38:49.283
You're discussing a crime
with your lawyer.

38:49.327 --> 38:50.371
No, no, no, no.

38:50.415 --> 38:52.199
I am discussing politics.

38:52.242 --> 38:53.809
Violence is not politics.

38:53.853 --> 38:56.377
Oh

39:20.488 --> 39:22.621
This won't slow us down.

39:27.452 --> 39:28.801
Excuse me, Mr. McVeigh?

39:28.844 --> 39:30.585
Maia Rindell.

39:30.629 --> 39:32.065
Oh, yes, Diane's goddaughter.

39:32.108 --> 39:33.588
Hello. How are you?Fine.

39:33.632 --> 39:36.461
Thank you. I was wondering
if I could get your help

39:36.504 --> 39:38.463
with a case
I'm working on.

39:38.506 --> 39:40.769
We think a gun was
planted by a policeman...

39:40.813 --> 39:42.597
Sorry, um, I've got
a lot going on.

39:42.641 --> 39:44.860
I'd better give Diane
her space right now.

39:44.904 --> 39:46.209
She's not involved
with this case.

39:46.253 --> 39:48.298
Well, I can
recommend someone.

39:48.342 --> 39:49.865
The policeman was
Detective Whitehead.

39:49.909 --> 39:53.434
We think he planted
a gun on our client,

39:53.478 --> 39:57.090
turning a three-year
drug sentence into 15.

39:57.133 --> 39:59.745
We just need you
to look at the file.

39:59.788 --> 40:01.050
Mr. McVeigh?

40:01.094 --> 40:03.139
You're next.

40:03.183 --> 40:04.489
Thank you for returning.

40:04.532 --> 40:06.142
You're welcome.

40:06.186 --> 40:09.058
The plaintiff attorneys
have already pointed out that

40:09.102 --> 40:10.538
you and Ms. Lockhart
are married.

40:10.582 --> 40:11.757
Yes.

40:11.800 --> 40:12.975
But, to be exact,

40:13.019 --> 40:16.152
the two of you are separated,
is that right?

40:16.196 --> 40:18.067
Yes.

40:18.111 --> 40:20.940
And have you asked her
to reconcile with you?

40:20.983 --> 40:22.681
Objection. Relevance.

40:22.724 --> 40:24.683
This is rebuttal
testimony, Your Honor.

40:24.726 --> 40:27.468
I never intended to venture
into personal territory,

40:27.512 --> 40:28.904
but the plaintiff attorneys

40:28.948 --> 40:30.819
have opened the door
to this relationship.

40:30.863 --> 40:33.256
That is true. Overruled.

40:33.300 --> 40:36.085
Did you ask Diane Lockhart
to reconcile with you?

40:36.129 --> 40:37.783
Yes.

40:37.826 --> 40:40.220
More than once?Yes.

40:40.263 --> 40:41.830
And why was that?

40:43.876 --> 40:46.487
I don't understand the question.

40:46.531 --> 40:47.967
You injured your wife deeply

40:48.010 --> 40:49.838
and you wanted to make amends,
is that correct?

40:51.840 --> 40:53.842
Yes. I...

40:59.021 --> 41:00.545
I hurt her.

41:00.588 --> 41:02.416
So did you
buy her jewelry?

41:02.460 --> 41:04.505
Come on. Objection,
Your Honor.

41:04.549 --> 41:07.552
This is an
expert witness, Your Honor.

41:07.595 --> 41:08.988
Gifts between lawyers
and witnesses

41:09.031 --> 41:10.468
are always subject
to examination.

41:10.511 --> 41:13.775
Cautiously overruled.

41:13.819 --> 41:15.864
I did not buy her jewelry, no.

41:15.908 --> 41:18.476
Did you take her on a vacation?No.

41:18.519 --> 41:21.261
But you apologized?Yes.

41:21.304 --> 41:23.263
And yet she still
did not reconcile?

41:23.306 --> 41:25.091
Asked and answered, Your Honor.

41:25.134 --> 41:26.919
You injured
your wife deeply,

41:26.962 --> 41:29.225
and you wanted to make amends.
You wanted your wife

41:29.269 --> 41:31.663
to reconcile with you,

41:31.706 --> 41:34.361
but you didn't buy
her perfume or jewelry

41:34.404 --> 41:36.885
or take her
on a vacation.

41:36.929 --> 41:40.062
What you did do was
testify at this trial.

41:40.106 --> 41:41.890
Objection!

41:41.934 --> 41:44.893
Counselor is not only
testifying, Your Honor,

41:44.937 --> 41:47.417
he's also drawing the
most absurd conclusions.

41:47.461 --> 41:49.942
I don't need an answer,
Your Honor.

41:49.985 --> 41:51.421
I think it's obvious.

42:03.564 --> 42:04.739
Could you hold that, please?

42:06.959 --> 42:09.527
Thanks.

42:16.838 --> 42:19.667
Do I know you?

42:19.711 --> 42:23.105
I don't think so.
Huh.

42:23.149 --> 42:26.892
You're a cop, right?
No.

42:26.935 --> 42:30.243
Ah.

42:30.286 --> 42:32.288
You got that cop look.

42:34.377 --> 42:36.728
Hi. Diane Lockhart, please.

42:41.254 --> 42:42.777
Uh, Maia Rindell.

42:48.174 --> 42:51.090
Hey.

42:51.133 --> 42:54.528
It looks good with furniture.

42:54.572 --> 42:57.662
Thanks.
Oof.

42:57.705 --> 42:59.925
A bit chilly.

43:03.450 --> 43:06.714
I've been feeling
a bit adrift these days.

43:06.758 --> 43:10.762
And I'm trying to find
some solid ground again.

43:10.805 --> 43:12.111
Sounds smart.

43:13.765 --> 43:18.247
I think that solid ground
means not being with you.

43:21.033 --> 43:23.339
That was quick.

43:23.383 --> 43:24.819
Did you find something?

43:24.863 --> 43:26.647
Yeah, yeah,
I think so.

43:26.691 --> 43:28.954
This is Lucca.
She's working on it, too.

43:28.997 --> 43:30.956
Yeah, I know Lucca.Hi, Kurt.

43:30.999 --> 43:33.828
This is the serial number
of the Glock 17

43:33.872 --> 43:36.701
that you said was planted
on Craig Savador.

43:36.744 --> 43:38.790
Mm-hmm.
376-

43:38.833 --> 43:41.401
88345.

43:41.444 --> 43:42.924
Okay.

43:42.968 --> 43:45.448
Now, there were no matches
in the police database,

43:45.492 --> 43:46.841
but I found this.

43:46.885 --> 43:49.365
Four Glock 17s recovered
from the robbery

43:49.409 --> 43:51.716
of a sporting goods
store a year earlier.

43:53.761 --> 43:57.199
88343, 88344,

43:57.243 --> 43:59.637
and...88346.

43:59.680 --> 44:01.029
45 is missing.

44:01.073 --> 44:03.075
That's right.So whoever investigated

44:03.118 --> 44:05.251
this sporting goods
robbery took it.

44:05.294 --> 44:06.992
That's my theory.Whitehead.

44:07.035 --> 44:09.342
He wasn't the investigator.

44:09.385 --> 44:11.300
Then who?

44:11.344 --> 44:13.085
Rashid Clarkson.

44:27.360 --> 44:30.145
Uh... what's going on?

44:33.061 --> 44:36.108
I asked you in court
if you knew Officer Whitehead.

44:36.151 --> 44:38.458
You said no.

44:38.501 --> 44:41.809
I hate it
when clients lie to me.

44:41.853 --> 44:43.724
What are you talking about?

44:43.768 --> 44:46.596
I take it personally.
I shouldn't, but I do.

44:46.640 --> 44:48.076
A low-level drug dealer

44:48.120 --> 44:51.166
is doing a decade for possession
of a Glock 17 handgun.

44:51.210 --> 44:53.038
You took it from a
sporting goods robbery,

44:53.081 --> 44:55.736
but you left it off
your evidence report.

44:55.780 --> 44:57.607
The drug dealer said
that the gun wasn't his.

44:57.651 --> 44:58.913
That it was planted

44:58.957 --> 45:02.134
by the arresting officer,
Whitehead.

45:02.177 --> 45:05.615
So how did
Whitehead get the gun?

45:05.659 --> 45:08.140
Could you explain that to me?
'Cause from where I stand,

45:08.183 --> 45:10.708
I think your multimillion-
dollar settlement

45:10.751 --> 45:12.927
is disappearing.

45:12.971 --> 45:14.494
What does that mean?

45:14.537 --> 45:16.322
What does a nod mean?

45:16.365 --> 45:19.760
We skimmed guns from busts.

45:19.804 --> 45:21.501
You and Whitehead?

45:21.544 --> 45:23.633
Yeah.

45:23.677 --> 45:25.853
The weapons we seized
were popular on the street.

45:25.897 --> 45:27.420
They made the
perfect drop gun.

45:27.463 --> 45:29.291
We'd give 'em to officers
who asked for one.

45:29.335 --> 45:30.815
Why did Whitehead shoot you?

45:30.858 --> 45:33.208
My guess is, he thought
I was gonna turn on him.

45:33.252 --> 45:36.168
Just wait, wait.

45:36.211 --> 45:37.952
We need to leave now.

45:37.996 --> 45:40.215
Why?Oh, God, you're right.

45:40.259 --> 45:42.435
Attorney-client
privilege.

45:42.478 --> 45:44.002
We can't be listening to this.

45:49.616 --> 45:52.053
Okay.

45:52.097 --> 45:54.752
Tell us everything.

45:54.795 --> 45:56.971
What happens to my lawsuit?

45:57.015 --> 45:58.973
If we're lucky,
and you tell the truth,

45:59.017 --> 46:02.281
the whole truth,

46:02.324 --> 46:04.457
maybe we can get a deal.

46:15.468 --> 46:18.166
The great society.

46:18.210 --> 46:21.256
I look out there and I see a
world that could have been.

46:21.300 --> 46:23.258
Diversity.
Cooperation.

46:23.302 --> 46:25.086
You did a lot
to foster that, sir.

46:25.130 --> 46:28.829
Feels like a dream.
So long ago.

46:28.873 --> 46:31.005
And maybe now this
is the nightmare.

46:31.049 --> 46:32.441
Oh, indeed it is.

46:32.485 --> 46:34.879
We made a discovery,
Mr. Waltzer.

46:34.922 --> 46:36.750
And we still think
that Chicago PD

46:36.794 --> 46:38.491
should pay $8.3 million.

46:38.534 --> 46:40.319
No.

46:42.582 --> 46:44.845
I didn't bring
my reading glasses.

46:44.889 --> 46:46.455
You don't wear
reading glasses.

46:46.499 --> 46:50.068
Those are all the
arrests Danny Whitehead made

46:50.111 --> 46:52.331
where he supposedly found guns
on the arrestees.

46:52.374 --> 46:54.507
Quite a few of them,
as you can see.

46:54.550 --> 46:55.943
Yeah, okay.

46:55.987 --> 46:57.292
And we've just
come across some information

46:57.336 --> 46:58.772
that those guns were planted
by Whitehead.

46:58.816 --> 47:01.557
Really?

47:01.601 --> 47:04.778
You've "just come across"

47:04.822 --> 47:06.432
Our client, Rashid Clarkson,

47:06.475 --> 47:08.086
supplied Whitehead
those drop guns.

47:08.129 --> 47:09.652
We think
there are 20 or 30

47:09.696 --> 47:12.351
felons in prison because
of Whitehead's testimony

47:12.394 --> 47:13.787
that they had
guns on them.

47:13.831 --> 47:15.049
And this came from your client?

47:16.485 --> 47:18.313
Yeah.

47:18.357 --> 47:20.315
And due to attorney-client
privilege, you can't use it?

47:20.359 --> 47:22.056
Unless he allows us to.

47:22.100 --> 47:24.145
♪

47:27.845 --> 47:29.672
So this is no longer
about the law.

47:29.716 --> 47:31.936
This is a,
this is a game of poker?

47:31.979 --> 47:33.502
If you wish,

47:33.546 --> 47:36.070
but my guess is that Chicago PD
would rather pay up

47:36.114 --> 47:39.639
instead of having
30 prosecutions reopened.

47:39.682 --> 47:41.989
And here we are, four idealists

47:42.033 --> 47:44.774
casting lots
over Jesus' garments.

47:44.818 --> 47:46.559
If you wish.

47:48.604 --> 47:50.737
I'll talk to my client.

47:53.871 --> 47:56.264
And meanwhile,
you can all go fuck yourselves.

47:59.702 --> 48:02.575
Obviously, we feel awful.

48:02.618 --> 48:04.925
Because we believe in your case,

48:04.969 --> 48:06.840
but now we have
a conflict of interest.

48:06.884 --> 48:09.756
You can't even tell me
what the conflict is?

48:09.799 --> 48:11.149
Well, I'm afraid even
explaining the conflict,

48:11.192 --> 48:12.890
I mean, that would
breach legal ethics.

48:12.933 --> 48:16.676
God, that
sounded lame. Uh...

48:16.719 --> 48:19.157
Craig, I'm sorry.

48:19.200 --> 48:20.985
We are so sorry.

48:21.028 --> 48:22.595
We will help you find
another lawyer.

48:22.638 --> 48:24.640
Sure.

48:26.294 --> 48:27.513
Thanks.

48:29.994 --> 48:31.952
We can file a
post-conviction petition

48:31.996 --> 48:33.258
based on
actual innocence.

48:33.301 --> 48:35.477
We can't, but
someone else can.

48:35.521 --> 48:36.696
Like who?

48:36.739 --> 48:38.916
Someone who doesn't
work at our firm.

48:38.959 --> 48:41.570
Like a public defender
with no time and no resources?

48:41.614 --> 48:43.529
We have no options.

48:43.572 --> 48:45.487
This is stupid. This is...

48:45.531 --> 48:47.968
Let's go.

48:56.150 --> 48:58.936
We couldn't have gotten this settlement without Marissa

48:58.979 --> 49:00.459
kicking ass.

49:02.026 --> 49:03.853
Hear, hear!
Hear, hear!

49:03.897 --> 49:04.942
Okay, okay.

49:04.985 --> 49:06.769
Thank you,
but I had a lot of help.

49:06.813 --> 49:08.336
And Jay, too.

49:20.174 --> 49:21.784
♪ Tonight is the night

49:28.661 --> 49:31.620
♪ The night of your life

49:31.664 --> 49:33.100
♪ The night of your life...

49:33.144 --> 49:34.406
Good job, Jay.

49:34.449 --> 49:37.626
Adrian, can I
talk to you?

49:37.670 --> 49:40.586
Oh. I'm in trouble.

49:40.629 --> 49:42.327
Somebody call
my lawyer.

49:42.370 --> 49:45.547
And I'll tell
you what.

49:45.591 --> 49:47.593
Don't drink up all my liquor.

49:47.636 --> 49:49.987
Too late.

50:00.910 --> 50:04.958
$8.3 million.

50:05.002 --> 50:08.875
We haven't had that big
a payday in a year.

50:08.918 --> 50:12.096
You accepted
the gag rule.

50:12.139 --> 50:15.838
I... What

50:15.882 --> 50:18.058
Chicago PD's gag rule.

50:18.102 --> 50:22.106
You agreed to it.
No.

50:22.149 --> 50:25.500
Attorney-client privilege.
Rashid is our client.

50:25.544 --> 50:26.936
That's our gag rule.

50:28.982 --> 50:31.985
What's the matter, Jay?

50:32.029 --> 50:34.553
My friend Craig has been
rotting away in prison

50:34.596 --> 50:37.947
because of a bullshit gun charge
Whitehead slapped on him.

50:37.991 --> 50:40.776
Okay.This settlement

50:40.820 --> 50:42.691
fucked him over.

50:42.735 --> 50:44.824
What are you talking about?

50:44.867 --> 50:47.174
We needed Rashid's statement
about the planted gun.

50:47.218 --> 50:48.436
Yeah, but we can't use that

50:48.480 --> 50:49.698
without getting
our client's permission.

50:49.742 --> 50:51.352
Then why don't we try to get it?

50:51.396 --> 50:52.832
Because your friend's
not my client, Jay.

50:52.875 --> 50:55.313
Rashid is, and we have a duty

50:55.356 --> 50:57.271
to represent and protect him
from risk.

50:57.315 --> 50:58.751
Even if he's a dirty cop?

50:58.794 --> 51:02.102
Rashid's morality
wasn't on trial here.

51:02.146 --> 51:05.236
This case was about an unarmed
black undercover cop

51:05.279 --> 51:07.238
shot by a white cop...

51:07.281 --> 51:08.804
No, this case was about
two crooked cops

51:08.848 --> 51:10.458
who turned on each other.

51:10.502 --> 51:13.331
And one of them got rich and the
other one walked away scot-free.

51:13.374 --> 51:15.072
And people like Craig
rot in prison.

51:17.987 --> 51:20.294
Jay, if your friend
is innocent,

51:20.338 --> 51:22.949
we can pick that up without
using Rashid's statement.

51:22.992 --> 51:24.907
Now, it might take
a little bit longer

51:24.951 --> 51:26.561
to get him out,
but, hey...

51:26.605 --> 51:29.042
"But, hey," we can let Craig sit
in prison so you can get rich.

51:29.086 --> 51:31.784
You know how things work
in these cases.

51:31.827 --> 51:33.742
As your boss,
I got to tell you,

51:33.786 --> 51:36.267
you're being childish
and you're being unprofessional.

51:36.310 --> 51:39.966
I'm not being unprofessional.
I'm telling the truth.

51:40.009 --> 51:43.361
Jay, I am sorry things
didn't work out for your friend.

51:43.404 --> 51:45.580
But what makes you think
that you have the right

51:45.624 --> 51:48.322
to come up in my firm
acting like this?

51:48.366 --> 51:50.194
Because it's our firm, too!

51:50.237 --> 51:52.109
The people
who work here,

51:52.152 --> 51:53.980
who sacrifice their time,
who put in the hours,

51:54.023 --> 51:56.678
who pour their heart out so that
you can hustle some slick game.

51:56.722 --> 51:58.811
Did you say "hustle" So I'm a hustler now?

51:58.854 --> 52:00.247
If the shoe fits.
Hey.

52:00.291 --> 52:02.858
Hey. If I'm a hustler, you are,
you are an ignorant...

52:02.902 --> 52:04.164
What?

52:04.208 --> 52:05.992
I'm an ignorant what?

52:06.035 --> 52:08.995
Man, get the fuck
out of my office

52:09.038 --> 52:10.997
before I put my
foot up your ass.

52:11.040 --> 52:13.521
No, you're not
even worth it.

52:13.565 --> 52:16.176
I quit.
