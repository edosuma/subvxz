00:00.034 --> 00:01.833
Previously on <i>Royal Pains</i>...

00:01.858 --> 00:04.458
Evan... it was really nice to meet you.

00:04.483 --> 00:05.983
Hope to see you again real soon.

00:06.034 --> 00:07.701
- Absolutely.
- Why didn't you tell Hank

00:07.703 --> 00:09.170
that you're doing shifts at the hospital?

00:09.172 --> 00:10.304
The only way out of this

00:10.306 --> 00:11.972
is for me to pay back Raj's parents.

00:11.974 --> 00:13.707
You thought I missed
the ascites, didn't you?

00:13.709 --> 00:15.276
I wasn't trying to flout your authority.

00:15.278 --> 00:16.877
Turns out you probably saved his life.

00:16.879 --> 00:18.579
I'd like to say thank you

00:18.581 --> 00:20.981
by buying you dinner.

00:20.983 --> 00:22.216
Would you care for a drink?

00:22.218 --> 00:24.051
Yeah, maybe after...

00:25.254 --> 00:28.088
So your theory then is that these persons

00:28.090 --> 00:30.090
created an accident to get to Marisa?

00:30.092 --> 00:32.293
- Yes.
- Find Marisa, find my son,

00:32.295 --> 00:33.661
and get me Galil.

00:33.663 --> 00:34.995
I'm gonna propose to Paige.

00:34.997 --> 00:36.864
Before you give her mom's ring,

00:36.866 --> 00:38.365
make sure you really know her.

01:16.571 --> 01:18.672
Excuse me. Are you okay?

01:18.674 --> 01:20.608
I'm okay, I'm okay.

01:20.610 --> 01:21.775
It's a cramp. Finish your run.

01:21.777 --> 01:22.877
I just have to work out the gastroc.

01:22.879 --> 01:24.812
- Not like that.
- Oh.

01:24.814 --> 01:26.347
You got to go with the contraction

01:26.349 --> 01:28.682
or you'll tear the muscle fiber
or, worse, wreck your achilles.

01:28.684 --> 01:29.950
All right. Thank you.

01:29.952 --> 01:31.685
Yeah, it hurts like a mother.

01:31.687 --> 01:33.220
Yeah.

01:33.222 --> 01:34.855
It's not your gastrocnemius.
It's your soleus.

01:34.857 --> 01:36.523
- Oh, cool.
- Okay, the second time

01:36.525 --> 01:38.158
isn't as bad. Breathe.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.927
Okay. Oh!

01:39.929 --> 01:40.928
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Oh!

01:40.930 --> 01:42.029
That really helps.

01:42.031 --> 01:44.031
I thought I was keeping hydrated,

01:44.033 --> 01:46.367
but this heat, my electrolytes
must have been out of whack.

01:46.369 --> 01:48.135
Actually, science has cooled on the whole

01:48.137 --> 01:50.504
cramping-hydration-electrolyte
connection.

01:50.506 --> 01:53.007
The latest hype is
that it's fatigued nerve signals

01:53.009 --> 01:54.141
run amok that cause cramping.

01:54.143 --> 01:55.376
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:55.378 --> 01:57.778
- Are you... are you a doctor?
- No, no.

01:57.780 --> 01:59.213
I'm just a seasoned runner.

01:59.215 --> 02:01.548
But this cramp, it was
from basic runner error.

02:01.550 --> 02:03.250
Never sprint after distance.

02:03.252 --> 02:05.319
Even if you are being outpaced by a girl.

02:05.321 --> 02:07.321
Oh!

02:07.323 --> 02:08.422
Here you go.

02:08.424 --> 02:09.657
You can put some weight on it now.

02:09.658 --> 02:10.858
Okay.

02:10.860 --> 02:12.326
Ahh.

02:12.328 --> 02:13.327
Okay.

02:13.329 --> 02:14.962
Aahh.

02:14.964 --> 02:16.764
- How's that?
- Better.

02:16.766 --> 02:17.932
- Thanks.
- Good.

02:17.934 --> 02:20.234
- I'm Hank.
- Jane. Jane Cameron.

02:20.236 --> 02:21.769
Hang on. Jane Cameron?

02:21.771 --> 02:23.904
Two-time world champion Jane Cameron?

02:23.906 --> 02:25.940
Jane Cameron who just won
the Boston marathon?

02:25.942 --> 02:27.508
2:20:55.

02:27.510 --> 02:29.243
Oh, my God, you almost broke
the course record.

02:29.245 --> 02:30.778
Eh, next time.

02:30.780 --> 02:32.746
And then you carried your baby
into the winners' circle.

02:32.748 --> 02:34.048
- Yeah.
- That was very cute.

02:34.050 --> 02:35.983
Okay, so you're a seasoned runner too.

02:35.985 --> 02:37.518
Nope, just a doctor.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.887
Really? I actually...

02:39.889 --> 02:41.155
I need a doctor. Are you a GP?

02:41.157 --> 02:43.424
The only thing
is I need someone right away.

02:43.426 --> 02:44.858
I may be able to help.

02:44.860 --> 02:45.859
- Is it sports-related?
- Mama!

02:45.861 --> 02:46.927
No. Sorry.

02:46.929 --> 02:49.430
Hi, sweetie. Hi.

02:49.432 --> 02:51.932
Where'd you come from?

02:51.934 --> 02:53.334
This is Mary.

02:53.336 --> 02:55.469
- Hi, Mary.
- This is Dr. Hank.

02:55.471 --> 02:57.972
- And this is Mary's nana Riza.
- Hi.

02:57.974 --> 02:59.473
- Hi.
- What happened?

02:59.475 --> 03:01.141
You never take so long for a 10k.

03:01.143 --> 03:02.576
That was your 10k pace?

03:02.578 --> 03:04.611
I'll stick to my day job

03:04.613 --> 03:06.413
where I'm sure I can work you in.

03:06.415 --> 03:07.982
Fantastic.

03:21.564 --> 03:23.864
Paige?

03:23.866 --> 03:26.600
What are you doing?

03:26.602 --> 03:28.202
Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

03:28.204 --> 03:30.604
You just look so sweet.

03:30.606 --> 03:33.907
I know. And you didn't actually.

03:33.909 --> 03:35.342
It was the heat that woke me up.

03:35.344 --> 03:37.978
Yeah. I like it hot.

03:37.980 --> 03:39.713
Gah.

03:39.715 --> 03:41.148
All right. Let me see it.

03:41.150 --> 03:44.151
Come on. Let me see it.

03:44.153 --> 03:45.419
Kate Winslet, eat your heart out.

03:45.421 --> 03:46.487
It's not finished.

03:46.489 --> 03:50.190
No, come on.

03:50.192 --> 03:52.659
Paige.

03:52.661 --> 03:54.828
Come on. It's of me.

03:54.830 --> 03:57.731
You're really not gonna show it to me?

03:57.733 --> 03:59.800
Whoa.

03:59.802 --> 04:01.802
When did you start doing abstracts?

04:01.804 --> 04:05.606
Paige, this is amazing.

04:05.608 --> 04:09.243
This is me cleaning my brush.

04:09.245 --> 04:10.844
Okay. I don't know art.

04:10.846 --> 04:12.479
I do know what I like, though.

04:14.749 --> 04:17.517
Oh, which piece did you choose?

04:17.519 --> 04:20.286
For the Hamptons Art Festival.
It starts tomorrow, right?

04:20.289 --> 04:23.757
Yeah, um, I actually missed the deadline

04:23.759 --> 04:27.161
with daddy's campaign and all.

04:27.163 --> 04:28.796
But you were so excited about it.

04:28.798 --> 04:30.964
I got excited. Come on.

04:30.966 --> 04:33.667
Amateurs' paintings hung side
by side with famous artists.

04:33.669 --> 04:36.904
That sounds like... it's got Paige
Collins written all over it.

04:36.906 --> 04:38.906
Well, not really, since it's anonymous.

04:38.908 --> 04:41.308
All the artists' identities
are kept secret.

04:41.310 --> 04:43.143
- You know what I mean.
- And we'll still go

04:43.145 --> 04:45.245
- and support them.
- No, but you should be in it.

04:45.247 --> 04:47.881
Come on, you're...
Paige, you're really good.

04:47.883 --> 04:49.817
You're really, really good.

04:49.819 --> 04:51.885
Thank you.

04:51.887 --> 04:53.353
Yeah.

04:53.355 --> 04:55.355
And you can paint too.

04:55.357 --> 04:57.758
What? You can.

04:57.760 --> 04:59.259
You can paint. You're amazing.

04:59.261 --> 05:00.794
You are amazing.

05:09.003 --> 05:10.971
Good one, Carlos.

05:10.973 --> 05:14.041
Hi, Divya. Tell us about your date.

05:14.043 --> 05:17.144
Okay, it is not a date.
Do not listen to Jill.

05:17.146 --> 05:19.012
It is a colleague's thank you,

05:19.014 --> 05:21.181
and, in any case,
I have not accepted yet.

05:21.183 --> 05:23.417
Divya, look in the mirror.

05:23.419 --> 05:25.219
It's a date. You should go.

05:25.221 --> 05:27.020
No, no, no, no, no,
it's okay to be scared to go.

05:27.022 --> 05:28.122
He is a doctor.

05:28.124 --> 05:29.590
I am a doctor, and I am telling you

05:29.592 --> 05:31.525
you do not want to date a doctor.

05:31.527 --> 05:32.893
Okay, it's not a date.

05:32.895 --> 05:35.429
Aye-yi-yi-yi-yi.

05:35.431 --> 05:36.630
What's so funny?

05:36.632 --> 05:38.098
Nothing.

05:38.100 --> 05:41.135
Carlos is just so cute.

05:41.137 --> 05:42.236
So cute.

05:42.238 --> 05:44.071
Uh, it's Boris.

05:44.073 --> 05:45.239
No. No, no, no. Don't say a word.

05:45.241 --> 05:46.807
Oh, okay, okay. Coming.

05:50.578 --> 05:52.980
- Hey. Hi.
- Hank.

05:52.982 --> 05:54.414
Oh, you brought the whole team.

05:54.416 --> 05:57.451
- What's up?
- Is Marisa not here?

05:57.453 --> 06:00.154
Uh, no, gee, I haven't seen her.

06:00.156 --> 06:01.288
She hasn't been here?

06:01.290 --> 06:02.823
She didn't bring the baby?

06:02.825 --> 06:04.358
Not that I...

06:04.360 --> 06:06.059
- Dieter!
- Alert the team.

06:07.329 --> 06:09.129
Tell them they never arrived,
for God's sake.

06:09.131 --> 06:10.330
Ya, ya, ya, ya.

06:10.332 --> 06:13.233
Boris. You can call off the red alert.

06:13.235 --> 06:16.003
I swear I felt more freedom under Fidel.

06:16.005 --> 06:17.971
Don't disappear like that.

06:17.973 --> 06:20.407
- She wanted to surprise you.
- Which is impossible.

06:20.409 --> 06:23.177
All right.

06:23.179 --> 06:24.645
Well, it's spoiled now,

06:24.647 --> 06:29.616
but you may as well pick your gift.

06:29.618 --> 06:30.617
<i>Querida.</i>

06:33.088 --> 06:35.389
Are you okay?

06:35.391 --> 06:38.058
Boris, you should sit down.

06:38.060 --> 06:40.260
Let me... let me get you a glass of water.

06:40.262 --> 06:44.731
I was concerned
she hadn't returned, so...

06:44.733 --> 06:47.668
Boris, come cool off.

06:47.670 --> 06:49.203
This heat is brutal.

06:54.742 --> 06:55.976
Damn it.

06:55.978 --> 06:57.211
It's just a spill. I got it.

06:57.213 --> 06:59.546
It's okay.

06:59.548 --> 07:01.848
You've been having muscle weakness?

07:01.850 --> 07:04.718
- Yeah.
- I need to examine you.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.720
Not now. Not now.

07:35.709 --> 07:40.709
Royal Pains 3x08 - Run, Hank, Run
Original air date August 17, 2011

Sync and corrected by atrn97g
www.addic7ed.com

07:49.170 --> 07:51.237
Tell me more about your symptoms.

07:51.239 --> 07:54.608
Well, it's only been since I arrived

07:54.610 --> 07:56.376
and it's been so hot.

07:56.378 --> 07:58.078
I was great training through the winter.

07:58.080 --> 08:00.880
But, um, now even after a recovery run,

08:00.882 --> 08:02.816
I get weak and feverish.

08:02.818 --> 08:04.651
If I try and push past it
and play with Mary,

08:04.653 --> 08:06.152
I get a headache.

08:06.154 --> 08:09.422
And nothing really helps except
a cool bath and some rest.

08:09.424 --> 08:11.925
And then you feel fine?

08:11.927 --> 08:14.527
Yeah, I think maybe it's heatstroke.

08:14.529 --> 08:17.497
Something's changed
about my core temp regulation

08:17.499 --> 08:19.132
- since giving birth.
- Not likely.

08:19.134 --> 08:22.102
Core temp changes take place
within weeks, not months.

08:22.104 --> 08:24.004
Have you been training extra hard?

08:24.006 --> 08:26.106
Not even. I'm on easy splits,

08:26.108 --> 08:28.174
intervals, 5, 10ks.

08:28.176 --> 08:29.843
Huh, well, heat could be a factor,

08:29.845 --> 08:31.745
but you're also anemic.

08:31.747 --> 08:33.078
I am?

08:33.081 --> 08:35.582
I've never been before. I eat meat.

08:35.583 --> 08:38.885
Well, it may not be
a diet-related iron deficiency.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.986
I'll have the lab run a full panel.

08:40.989 --> 08:42.856
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

08:51.165 --> 08:54.034
Hey, Paige?

08:55.403 --> 08:57.871
Paige, you here, babe?

09:16.390 --> 09:18.591
No.

09:21.162 --> 09:23.463
Yes.

09:35.076 --> 09:36.676
Hey, Evan.

09:36.678 --> 09:38.011
I didn't know you were here.

09:38.013 --> 09:39.145
I wasn't.

09:39.147 --> 09:41.347
I mean, I didn't know you were here,

09:41.349 --> 09:43.283
Mrs. Collins. How are you?

09:43.285 --> 09:45.185
How's the campaign trail...

09:45.187 --> 09:46.419
trailing?

09:46.421 --> 09:47.787
Paige isn't with you?

09:47.789 --> 09:50.657
Paige is...
not at the moment, she's not.

09:50.659 --> 09:51.658
Usually she is, though.

09:51.660 --> 09:53.693
Because I don't just wander

09:53.695 --> 09:55.462
around your house when no one's here.

09:55.464 --> 09:57.664
Is that her portfolio?

09:57.666 --> 09:59.132
Yes.

09:59.134 --> 10:00.867
She's so gifted.

10:00.869 --> 10:02.502
I know. I know.

10:02.504 --> 10:04.504
She's, like, the best artist
I've ever met.

10:04.506 --> 10:06.639
I'm glad you noticed.

10:06.641 --> 10:09.242
That's more than I can say
for her other boyfriends.

10:11.145 --> 10:14.447
By other you meant previous,
right, Mrs. Collins?

10:28.496 --> 10:30.430
Did you not receive my message?

10:30.432 --> 10:31.798
I got it.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.666
I didn't think we should wait.

10:35.603 --> 10:38.371
What does medicine say about the irony

10:38.373 --> 10:40.373
of one's incurable disease

10:40.375 --> 10:43.309
commencing just as one
has something to live for?

10:43.311 --> 10:46.146
It says, "don't jump to conclusions."

10:46.148 --> 10:48.882
Not every change signals
the start of your illness.

10:48.884 --> 10:51.417
It's extremely hot and humid.

10:51.419 --> 10:52.752
You have a new baby.

10:52.754 --> 10:57.757
It could be exhaustion,
or you could have a summer flu.

10:57.759 --> 10:59.092
Miss Katdare, do I have a fever?

10:59.094 --> 11:00.360
No.

11:00.362 --> 11:02.195
I believe we've ruled out flu.

11:02.197 --> 11:05.098
Even if your myopathy
is an early symptom,

11:05.100 --> 11:08.067
it will most likely be
a very slow and gradual process.

11:08.069 --> 11:09.836
You mean decline.

11:09.838 --> 11:11.104
It could take years
for the muscle atrophy

11:11.106 --> 11:12.539
to be debilitating.

11:12.541 --> 11:15.074
And even longer before you
experience bone deterioration.

11:15.076 --> 11:17.944
Thank you both for failing
to list the dementia

11:17.946 --> 11:19.345
that will surely follow.

11:19.347 --> 11:20.880
We should include Marisa.

11:20.882 --> 11:22.515
She is an expert in VCP mutations.

11:22.517 --> 11:25.685
Once my blood results are back, all right?

11:30.191 --> 11:31.758
I'm sorry. Why are you still here?

11:31.760 --> 11:33.560
I said no. It's too late.

11:33.562 --> 11:36.095
Submissions were finalized last week.

11:36.097 --> 11:37.931
I know. That's the rule, right?

11:37.933 --> 11:39.966
But isn't art about the exception,

11:39.968 --> 11:41.901
if you think about it?
Just please take a quick look.

11:41.903 --> 11:42.902
My friend's got talent.

11:42.904 --> 11:44.137
Everyone has a friend with talent.

11:44.139 --> 11:46.773
Is everyone's friend a Collins, though?

11:46.775 --> 11:47.907
As in General Collins.

11:47.909 --> 11:50.176
Ellen Collins is painting again?

11:50.178 --> 11:53.213
No. No, her daughter Paige Collins.

11:53.215 --> 11:54.948
But the family has been very generous

11:54.950 --> 11:56.382
to the art festival over the years.

11:56.384 --> 11:58.952
Of course I support
any serious student, but...

11:58.954 --> 12:01.588
Just look, okay?

12:01.590 --> 12:04.858
This is... huh.

12:06.327 --> 12:07.727
This is impressive.

12:07.729 --> 12:09.495
Look, every artist needed
that first person,

12:09.497 --> 12:11.331
that one person
who saw something in their work

12:11.333 --> 12:12.665
and gave 'em a break.

12:12.667 --> 12:15.368
Every... Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael.

12:15.370 --> 12:18.071
If you say Donatello, I am going to know

12:18.073 --> 12:19.606
you're citing <i>Ninja Turtles.</i>

12:19.608 --> 12:22.208
Who also needed a break.

12:22.210 --> 12:24.377
Come on.

12:24.379 --> 12:25.545
Those are part of the show.

12:25.547 --> 12:26.613
You're letting rubber duckies in,

12:26.615 --> 12:28.047
but you're not gonna consider...

12:28.049 --> 12:29.616
There was that painter that did withdraw

12:29.618 --> 12:31.284
this morning.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.889
I'll take this one.

12:35.891 --> 12:40.760
James, catalog this and hang it at 29.

12:40.762 --> 12:42.662
And be careful
when you cover the signature.

12:42.664 --> 12:44.564
Very good eye, by the way.

12:44.566 --> 12:46.099
I love... I... I could
stare at that for hours.

12:46.101 --> 12:48.334
It's not easy to capture that
kind of perfection, you know.

12:48.336 --> 12:49.936
Does it have a title?

12:49.938 --> 12:54.941
Um, is <i>Nature's Bounty</i> too obvious?

12:54.943 --> 12:56.409
<i>Nature's Bounty.</i> Great.

12:56.411 --> 12:57.977
Mm-hmm.

12:57.979 --> 12:59.946
Thank you.

13:05.119 --> 13:06.819
Marisa, where are you going?

13:06.821 --> 13:08.821
You must talk to Boris.

13:22.036 --> 13:24.370
Boris.

13:24.372 --> 13:25.772
This is crazy.

13:25.774 --> 13:28.274
This is exactly what we agreed
shouldn't happen.

13:28.276 --> 13:29.676
What is it you think has happened, Hank?

13:29.678 --> 13:31.711
I think Marisa's being sent
away without being told

13:31.713 --> 13:32.912
you might be symptomatic.

13:32.914 --> 13:33.947
This is true.

13:33.949 --> 13:35.648
It's a drastic overreaction.

13:35.650 --> 13:37.283
At the first hint of symptoms,

13:37.285 --> 13:39.619
you're shutting out someone
who loves you and can help.

13:39.621 --> 13:41.521
I mean, you can't allow yourself
to be isolated

13:41.523 --> 13:43.623
and terrorized by your illness.

13:43.625 --> 13:47.293
I'm not afraid of my illness, Hank.

13:47.295 --> 13:49.696
I'm afraid someone is after my son.

14:01.573 --> 14:04.942
When I visited Kleinwalsertal this winter,

14:04.944 --> 14:06.810
certain cousins of mine

14:06.812 --> 14:10.481
were not thrilled to hear
I would father an heir.

14:10.483 --> 14:13.517
You think your relatives are
capable of harming your child?

14:13.519 --> 14:14.752
The hit on my car,

14:14.754 --> 14:16.787
which Ms. Casey deduced correctly

14:16.789 --> 14:19.523
was not an accident,
suggests my adversaries

14:19.525 --> 14:22.459
might attempt a kidnapping
to leverage their position, no?

14:22.461 --> 14:25.229
That's incredible.

14:25.231 --> 14:27.765
Unfortunately, Hank, in my position,

14:27.767 --> 14:29.066
it is all too credible.

14:31.270 --> 14:33.437
After today's false alarm,

14:33.439 --> 14:36.607
I realized I could not shield
Marisa from the truth anymore.

14:36.609 --> 14:39.777
She's agreed to take Carlos
to a safe haven.

14:39.779 --> 14:41.812
I'll join them when I can.

14:41.814 --> 14:44.548
Boris, you've been under extreme pressure.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.751
I'm sorry I accused you
of hiding symptoms.

14:47.753 --> 14:49.887
If Marisa were aware of the onset,

14:49.889 --> 14:51.555
do you think she would have agreed to go?

14:51.557 --> 14:53.791
Given these stressors,
your physical reactions

14:53.793 --> 14:55.192
may not be symptoms at all.

14:55.194 --> 14:59.863
I'm afraid evidence
is developing to the contrary.

14:59.865 --> 15:01.198
What do you mean?

15:01.200 --> 15:03.000
I've begun to have pain

15:03.002 --> 15:04.501
in my feet and legs.

15:04.503 --> 15:06.503
On a scale of one to ten?

15:06.505 --> 15:08.338
Deep pain, Hank. Deep. In the bone.

15:08.340 --> 15:10.140
I can remember my father describing

15:10.142 --> 15:12.409
just this type of pain.

15:12.411 --> 15:15.112
I can't believe it would
spread to your bones so rapidly,

15:15.114 --> 15:17.548
but I'll give you anti-inflammatories,

15:17.550 --> 15:19.683
and let's get you
to the hospital for an MRI

15:19.685 --> 15:20.818
- and a bone scan.
- No. No hospitals.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.886
That's why you're here.

15:22.888 --> 15:25.255
You want me to order everything in?

15:25.257 --> 15:27.391
Tell Dieter what you need.

15:27.393 --> 15:28.325
All right?

15:39.637 --> 15:42.873
So my anemia isn't diet-related?

15:42.875 --> 15:45.209
The iron studies show a hemolytic anemia,

15:45.211 --> 15:47.344
meaning your red blood cells
are being destroyed

15:47.346 --> 15:48.946
faster than they can be replaced.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.447
Why would that happen?

15:50.449 --> 15:52.049
Your blood smear
will help us answer that.

15:52.051 --> 15:55.586
Unfortunately, the lab
doesn't have those results yet.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.321
But you have a theory.

15:57.323 --> 15:59.389
There's a microangiopathic condition

15:59.391 --> 16:02.593
called runner's, or marcher's, anemia.

16:02.595 --> 16:05.496
It occurs in infantry
and long-distance runners.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.798
The repetitive pounding of one's feet

16:07.800 --> 16:10.601
compresses the capillaries
and leads to the fragmentation

16:10.603 --> 16:11.902
of red blood cells.

16:11.904 --> 16:14.004
But I only run a few miles on asphalt.

16:14.006 --> 16:15.305
Mostly I'm on sand.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.141
Still, if your foot strike is too heavy,

16:17.143 --> 16:19.176
it causes the excretion of hemoglobin.

16:19.178 --> 16:20.677
My foot strike is flawless.

16:20.679 --> 16:23.247
My heel never lands
ahead of my center of gravity,

16:23.249 --> 16:25.883
I shock-absorb mid-sole,
springing to my toes,

16:25.885 --> 16:27.718
every stride is calibrated.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.053
Look, as you said, it's a theory.

16:30.055 --> 16:31.121
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

16:31.123 --> 16:32.689
Let's do a stress test.

16:32.691 --> 16:36.026
I will admire your flawless foot strike

16:36.028 --> 16:37.895
and monitor your heart rate

16:37.897 --> 16:39.997
and core temp at the same time.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.266
And you want me to run on that thing?

16:42.268 --> 16:44.501
I was... that's what I was thinking.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.503
Why, is it... is it sacrilege?

16:46.505 --> 16:49.673
Like eating sugar-free carob
in a world of Belgian chocolate.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.074
Besides, it's when I'm in the sun

16:51.076 --> 16:52.442
that my core temp goes kaphooey.

16:52.444 --> 16:54.311
Lucky for you I happen to have a gizmo

16:54.313 --> 16:56.146
that will measure your kaphooey level.

16:56.148 --> 16:58.148
Well, great. Bring it.
We'll run together later.

16:59.317 --> 17:00.484
It's nice, huh?

17:00.486 --> 17:01.718
Mm-hmm.

17:01.720 --> 17:03.687
Um, yeah, sure. You're better.

17:03.689 --> 17:04.954
Shh, stop saying that.

17:04.957 --> 17:06.656
It's true.

17:06.659 --> 17:09.059
Why don't we mosey on into the tent?

17:09.060 --> 17:11.694
Unless you lost interest after
you didn't submit, that is?

17:11.696 --> 17:14.364
No, I am so relieved I didn't apply.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.098
I'd have been too nervous
to enjoy myself.

17:16.101 --> 17:18.367
You should be proud of your work.

17:18.369 --> 17:22.705
I am, but sharing it
is such a personal thing.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.340
So exposing.

17:24.343 --> 17:26.609
You know, like being naked in public.

17:26.612 --> 17:30.514
Right. But naked in a good way, right?

17:30.516 --> 17:32.849
'Cause... I'm just not ready.

17:32.851 --> 17:35.018
You can respect that, right?

17:35.020 --> 17:36.186
Totally. Yeah.

17:36.188 --> 17:39.590
Of course, respect can be shown
in many ways.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.091
Evan.

17:41.093 --> 17:44.428
Doesn't art really belong to the public?

17:44.430 --> 17:45.862
Evan, you didn't. Did you?

17:45.864 --> 17:47.197
Tell me you didn't.

17:47.199 --> 17:48.899
I didn't. I did.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.868
I just wanted to support you. That's all.

17:51.870 --> 17:53.670
What possessed you?

17:53.672 --> 17:55.138
Oh, no. What did you give them?

17:55.140 --> 17:56.873
A really good one.
It's one of my favorites.

17:56.875 --> 18:00.911
It's... look, I didn't mean
to expose you. I just...

18:00.913 --> 18:03.380
Well, at least you exposed yourself too.

18:03.382 --> 18:06.316
What do you mean by...

18:06.318 --> 18:08.252
Oh, good Nelly.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.987
Oh, my God.

18:09.989 --> 18:11.955
And somebody's looking at it.

18:11.957 --> 18:15.325
Yeah, he... yeah, he really is.

18:15.327 --> 18:17.594
Still?

18:17.596 --> 18:21.431
Yeah, he's really drinking it in.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.333
Yeah, move on, buddy.

18:29.007 --> 18:31.241
This is really one of your favorites?

18:31.243 --> 18:35.779
It is hard to choose
which one is my favorite.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.914
You're not embarrassed
to be on the wall like that?

18:37.916 --> 18:39.916
No. Not for you.

18:39.918 --> 18:42.853
It's not even that obvious. Come on.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.187
Like, if you didn't know me...

18:44.189 --> 18:47.758
- Look, it's the naked guy.
- Come on.

18:53.765 --> 18:54.865
That's good.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.133
I'm sorry, okay.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.501
I'm sorry if I overstepped.

18:57.503 --> 19:01.605
I'm... I just believe in you. That's all.

19:01.607 --> 19:03.407
I know you're upset.

19:03.409 --> 19:04.908
I'm not upset.

19:04.910 --> 19:06.810
I mean, yeah, it's weird being here

19:06.812 --> 19:10.180
with all these real artists, but...

19:10.182 --> 19:12.249
Thank you for believing in me.

19:12.251 --> 19:15.519
And at least it is anonymous.

19:15.521 --> 19:16.920
Excuse me. Excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

19:16.922 --> 19:18.822
What?

19:18.824 --> 19:20.090
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

19:20.092 --> 19:21.892
We have another sale.

19:21.894 --> 19:24.461
Oh.

19:25.730 --> 19:27.297
That's great.

19:27.299 --> 19:30.600
Yeah.

19:33.905 --> 19:36.406
Your MRI was clear.

19:36.408 --> 19:38.675
Your bone scan
shows synchronized remodeling

19:38.677 --> 19:40.477
with no disturbance.

19:40.479 --> 19:42.412
No bowing or bending.

19:42.414 --> 19:44.281
No brittle areas.

19:44.283 --> 19:46.450
No misshaped joints. None at all.

19:46.452 --> 19:48.318
We are still waiting on your blood work,

19:48.320 --> 19:49.453
which will tell us more.

19:49.455 --> 19:50.787
How's the pain?

19:50.789 --> 19:52.656
The anti-inflammatories you gave me

19:52.658 --> 19:54.424
have greatly reduced it.

19:54.426 --> 19:57.494
Perhaps I was jumping the gun.

19:57.496 --> 20:00.097
I feel almost up
to swimming a few laps today.

20:00.099 --> 20:02.065
Don't overdo it.

20:02.067 --> 20:04.334
You are still having some muscle weakness.

20:04.336 --> 20:06.370
As soon as I get your
blood work, I'll report back.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.772
Very good.

20:12.210 --> 20:13.810
There it is.

20:13.812 --> 20:16.380
Wow. There is really
a thermometer inside this thing?

20:16.382 --> 20:17.414
Yup.

20:17.416 --> 20:19.449
So you swallow it. Here.

20:19.451 --> 20:21.385
It monitors your core temp,

20:21.387 --> 20:22.719
which I read with this.

20:22.721 --> 20:26.790
- Cool.
- I told you I had gizmos.

20:26.792 --> 20:29.259
Here.

20:29.261 --> 20:30.894
All right. Let's do it.

21:15.173 --> 21:17.507
Nice.

21:17.509 --> 21:19.509
I like to cool down out here.

21:19.511 --> 21:22.379
Once Mary sees I'm home, it's mommy time.

21:22.381 --> 21:25.949
Mm-hmm.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.551
How do you feel?

21:27.553 --> 21:29.085
Strong.

21:29.087 --> 21:30.921
Maybe a little warm.

21:30.923 --> 21:33.557
Your core temp has been stable
at 102 for the last 20 minutes.

21:33.559 --> 21:35.525
Normal.

21:35.527 --> 21:37.461
Guess a watched pot doesn't boil.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.329
Hey. Right on cue.

21:39.331 --> 21:40.964
Oh.

21:40.966 --> 21:43.166
This may be your results.

21:43.168 --> 21:45.502
Yeah, Hank here.

21:45.504 --> 21:47.103
Right.

21:47.105 --> 21:49.706
Okay, what about the smear?

21:49.708 --> 21:51.842
Still? I put a rush on that.

21:51.844 --> 21:55.212
All right. Okay. Never mind.

21:55.214 --> 21:56.713
So there was hemoglobin in your urine

21:56.715 --> 21:59.015
consistent with a hemolytic anemia.

21:59.017 --> 22:01.384
I'm gonna have to do my own...

22:01.386 --> 22:03.553
Jane, are you okay?

22:03.555 --> 22:06.156
Here, here, give me Mary.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.091
Hi, Mary. Sit with your head down.

22:08.093 --> 22:09.426
Right now.

22:09.428 --> 22:11.027
Whoa. Riza, I need your help.

22:12.297 --> 22:14.598
It's okay.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.533
Here you go. Here you go, Mary.

22:28.120 --> 22:31.188
Your core temp has spiked.

22:31.190 --> 22:33.690
I'm gonna give you acetaminophen.

22:33.692 --> 22:35.893
Do you think riza could draw a cool bath?

22:35.895 --> 22:37.728
That usually helps.

22:37.730 --> 22:39.496
Yeah, it won't hurt.

22:39.498 --> 22:41.532
I'm gonna draw blood and do my own smear,

22:41.534 --> 22:43.500
see if we can get you some answers.

22:46.905 --> 22:48.705
Mary feels warm.

22:48.707 --> 22:50.307
Have her join you in the tub.

23:07.892 --> 23:09.660
Mary's temperature's back to normal.

23:09.662 --> 23:10.794
Good.

23:10.796 --> 23:12.496
Glad to hear it.

23:12.498 --> 23:14.898
Here, I'm just gonna...

23:16.836 --> 23:19.670
And so is yours.

23:19.672 --> 23:21.672
Great.

23:22.941 --> 23:26.243
But your blood smear
showed an abnormality

23:26.245 --> 23:27.678
called Heinz bodies.

23:27.680 --> 23:30.147
That's just you don't have
runner's anemia...

23:30.149 --> 23:33.750
You have another
hemolytic anemia called G6PD.

23:33.752 --> 23:35.319
And what is that?

23:35.321 --> 23:37.287
It's an enzyme deficiency
that makes it hard

23:37.289 --> 23:38.288
to process iron.

23:38.290 --> 23:39.790
I don't understand.

23:39.792 --> 23:41.592
Why did that start right now?

23:41.594 --> 23:43.427
It didn't. You were born with it.

23:43.429 --> 23:45.529
But it takes one
of several possible triggers

23:45.531 --> 23:47.364
to activate the condition.

23:47.366 --> 23:48.999
Have you started any new medicines

23:49.001 --> 23:50.234
that you failed to mention?

23:50.236 --> 23:52.603
No.

23:52.605 --> 23:54.972
Well, then we need
to get you an appointment

23:54.974 --> 23:59.409
with a hematologist to confirm
and to identify your trigger.

23:59.411 --> 24:02.412
Do you need any help there?

24:02.414 --> 24:04.815
Okay.

24:04.817 --> 24:07.284
And since it's inherited,

24:07.286 --> 24:09.119
Mary needs to be tested too.

24:09.121 --> 24:11.755
Wait, Mary could be sick?

24:11.757 --> 24:14.024
Like you, she could be
sensitive to a trigger.

24:14.026 --> 24:17.528
But you've already escaped the
worst scenario for an infant.

24:17.530 --> 24:20.731
I mean, if a child goes
undiagnosed and is suddenly ill

24:20.733 --> 24:23.367
for no reason, it can become critical.

24:26.070 --> 24:27.671
Look, Mary should be fine, okay?

24:27.673 --> 24:28.872
I'll get you both appointments,

24:28.874 --> 24:30.440
and, once they identify the substance

24:30.442 --> 24:31.675
that's your trigger, there's no reason

24:31.677 --> 24:34.111
you can't both live like champions.

24:34.113 --> 24:36.580
Champions.

24:36.582 --> 24:39.416
But until then, no running.

24:39.418 --> 24:41.752
Yeah.

24:45.423 --> 24:48.392
Wow, this is amazing.

24:48.394 --> 24:49.993
Oh, there's Evan.

24:49.995 --> 24:52.262
- Uh, hey.
- Oh, hey.

24:52.264 --> 24:54.531
What the hell... you guys... you guys came.

24:54.533 --> 24:55.699
Yeah, of course we did.

24:55.701 --> 24:57.134
You said Paige had a picture in the show.

24:57.136 --> 24:59.136
Yes, I did.

24:59.138 --> 25:01.038
Where is it?

25:01.040 --> 25:04.942
Um, her painting has been sold already.

25:04.944 --> 25:08.111
So you missed that part of it.

25:08.113 --> 25:11.481
So I'll show it to you later,
though, if you can f...

25:11.483 --> 25:13.784
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

25:16.354 --> 25:17.788
Oh, my God.

25:17.790 --> 25:20.524
Wait, wait. Someone bought this?

25:20.526 --> 25:23.760
Oh, wow, that is really detailed.

25:23.762 --> 25:25.529
Like an accident. You want to look away,

25:25.531 --> 25:27.030
but you can't.

25:27.032 --> 25:28.932
You can mock it if you must,

25:28.934 --> 25:31.501
but this sketch
was just purchased by none other

25:31.503 --> 25:33.837
than Eric Kassabian
of Kassabian Galleries,

25:33.839 --> 25:35.439
Manhattan, Rome, Madrid.

25:35.441 --> 25:37.708
He just basically cherry-picked
all the famous painters here.

25:37.710 --> 25:39.843
The only unknown artist
he bought was Paige.

25:39.845 --> 25:41.278
Um, question.

25:41.280 --> 25:43.680
Do you call that forced perspective

25:43.682 --> 25:45.449
or wishful thinking?

25:45.451 --> 25:47.884
Hey, you're all here.

25:47.886 --> 25:49.186
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:49.188 --> 25:50.687
- Congrats on the sale.
- Thank you.

25:50.689 --> 25:52.589
And this is the man who bought it.

25:52.591 --> 25:54.324
Eric, please meet everyone.

25:54.326 --> 25:55.826
This is Divya, Jill,

25:55.828 --> 25:57.094
Hank, and Evan.

25:57.096 --> 25:58.328
This is Eric Kassabian.

25:58.330 --> 25:59.696
Eric Kassabian. Cool. Nice to meet you.

25:59.698 --> 26:02.266
I'm Evan. You probably recognize
me from the...

26:02.268 --> 26:04.301
We're tight. That's all I can say.

26:04.303 --> 26:06.703
You know what really caught my eye?

26:06.705 --> 26:08.939
Was this line.

26:08.941 --> 26:11.341
- So Degas, you know?
- I love Degas.

26:11.343 --> 26:13.710
Oh, it shows.
Your warmth is what rescued

26:13.712 --> 26:15.212
the subject from cliche.

26:15.214 --> 26:17.281
Paige, you know, her warmth rescued me...

26:17.283 --> 26:18.815
Did you say cliche?

26:18.817 --> 26:20.217
I'd actually love
to see more of your work.

26:20.219 --> 26:21.418
- Do you have a booth?
- I don't.

26:21.420 --> 26:23.587
- You don't?
- Yeah, but her portfolio's

26:23.589 --> 26:25.989
in my car, so we should grab it.

26:25.991 --> 26:27.824
Oh, would you? Thanks, Evan.

26:27.826 --> 26:30.193
And there's an artist
that I want you to meet,

26:30.195 --> 26:31.962
someone that actually I collect.

26:31.964 --> 26:33.363
Do you know Damien Hirst?

26:33.365 --> 26:34.831
- Is he here?
- Yeah.

26:34.833 --> 26:36.533
I met him at an opening in Soho,

26:36.535 --> 26:38.035
but I don't think he would remember.

26:38.037 --> 26:39.202
Oh, I'm sure he remembers you.

26:39.204 --> 26:40.370
- You're not very forgettable.
- Aw.

26:52.383 --> 26:54.851
Katdare. You just coming on?

26:54.853 --> 26:56.653
I worked all night. Hematology.

26:56.655 --> 26:58.989
Oh, tell me you didn't
second-guess any hematologists.

26:58.991 --> 27:00.390
I'm the jealous type.

27:00.392 --> 27:01.591
So Friday, Nick and Toni's.

27:01.593 --> 27:03.360
Going once, going twice,

27:03.362 --> 27:05.195
it's a date.

27:05.197 --> 27:06.997
He said it's a date.

27:06.999 --> 27:08.799
He also called me Katdare.

27:08.801 --> 27:11.468
He calls the rest of us "hey, you."

27:13.771 --> 27:15.839
Okay, well, I'm glad
you got it confirmed.

27:15.841 --> 27:17.574
How'd Mary do with the tests?

27:17.576 --> 27:20.577
Okay, well, I'm coming by the hospital,

27:20.579 --> 27:22.646
so if you're still there,
I'll get a full update then.

27:22.648 --> 27:24.548
All right. See you soon, Jane.

27:24.550 --> 27:26.950
Ah! I didn't know you were here.

27:26.952 --> 27:29.586
Yup. Hello.

27:29.588 --> 27:30.821
Divya called.

27:30.823 --> 27:32.723
She's gonna be
a little late this morning.

27:32.725 --> 27:35.926
She's actually been taking
her days off more lately.

27:35.928 --> 27:36.960
Have you noticed that?

27:36.962 --> 27:38.762
No.

27:38.764 --> 27:40.097
Paige here?

27:40.099 --> 27:42.566
No, she's... she's beat, she said,

27:42.568 --> 27:44.501
and her mom just got home, so...

27:44.503 --> 27:46.636
I think the whole thing
was pretty overwhelming...

27:46.638 --> 27:49.906
for her. Sorry, am I... am I boring you?

27:49.908 --> 27:53.143
No, no, no, I just got
Boris's blood results.

27:53.145 --> 27:56.012
These numbers make no sense.
No sense at all.

27:56.014 --> 27:57.381
Could it be a mistake or something?

27:57.383 --> 28:00.016
Either that, or Boris
is headed into kidney failure.

28:00.018 --> 28:03.854
- He asked not to be disturbed.
- Don't worry.

28:03.856 --> 28:05.122
It'll be my neck.

28:05.124 --> 28:07.491
Boris? It's Hank.

28:07.493 --> 28:09.726
I need you to wake up.

28:09.728 --> 28:11.261
Did he take anything to sleep?

28:11.263 --> 28:12.562
No.

28:12.564 --> 28:13.897
I'm checking your heart rate.

28:13.899 --> 28:15.365
Uh!

28:15.367 --> 28:16.867
That hurts?

28:16.869 --> 28:18.368
Hyperesthesia to touch.

28:18.370 --> 28:20.704
Okay, do you have other pain?

28:20.706 --> 28:22.406
My legs.

28:22.408 --> 28:24.875
The soles of my feet are...

28:24.877 --> 28:27.077
burning.

28:27.079 --> 28:28.278
Stomach cramps.

28:28.280 --> 28:30.947
Do you have nausea, any tingling

28:30.949 --> 28:34.050
- or numbness?
- Yeah, in my arms. Hank.

28:34.052 --> 28:36.386
Okay, Boris, I need to draw more blood.

28:36.388 --> 28:38.588
Your last results showed
elevated creatinine, B.U.N.,

28:38.590 --> 28:39.790
and liver enzymes,

28:39.792 --> 28:41.725
but your potassium was in the cellar,

28:41.727 --> 28:43.860
and other minerals were all over the map.

28:43.862 --> 28:46.296
Okay, here we go.

28:47.266 --> 28:50.434
- Boris!
- Ah.

28:54.739 --> 28:56.506
All right. Okay, okay.

28:56.508 --> 28:57.674
What just happened?

28:57.676 --> 28:58.875
Why did you pull away?

29:00.312 --> 29:01.511
I couldn't see.

29:01.513 --> 29:02.646
What's wrong with your eyesight?

29:02.648 --> 29:05.715
There's a black spot

29:05.717 --> 29:08.752
in the middle of... in the middle of...

29:08.754 --> 29:11.354
Boris, does it hurt to move your eyes

29:11.356 --> 29:13.190
from side to side? Try it right now.

29:16.594 --> 29:18.261
Yes. Yes.

29:18.263 --> 29:20.297
Retrobulbar neuritis? Are you kidding me?

29:20.299 --> 29:21.598
What is that?

29:21.600 --> 29:22.833
An inflammation of the optic nerve.

29:22.835 --> 29:24.701
But why... none of these symptoms

29:24.703 --> 29:25.735
line up with your illness.

29:25.737 --> 29:29.673
The differential is ex...

29:29.675 --> 29:31.007
What?

29:31.009 --> 29:33.276
Paresthesia.

29:33.278 --> 29:35.879
My fingertips are tingling
from touching your blood.

29:35.881 --> 29:38.281
Why would that be?

29:38.283 --> 29:40.684
These aren't symptoms of your disease.

29:42.353 --> 29:45.388
You've been poisoned.

29:50.712 --> 29:53.647
They need to test for toxins
and heavy metals,

29:53.649 --> 29:55.249
and it needs to happen now.

29:55.251 --> 29:56.683
Okay, thanks, Jill.

29:58.887 --> 30:00.754
Good timing. Come right in.

30:00.756 --> 30:03.023
Okay, you can set it up
right over here, guys.

30:03.025 --> 30:04.892
Thank you.

30:04.894 --> 30:07.061
Boris, please roll over a little.

30:07.063 --> 30:09.930
Good.

30:09.932 --> 30:12.466
That's it.

30:14.536 --> 30:16.804
Boris, I'm giving you a little sedation.

30:19.808 --> 30:22.142
I'll start a central line
so we can hemoperfuse,

30:22.144 --> 30:24.878
draw out your blood and pass it
over absorbent charcoal

30:24.880 --> 30:26.413
to remove toxins.

30:26.415 --> 30:28.582
Do you understand me?

30:28.584 --> 30:30.050
Okay, guys, I may need your help.

30:30.052 --> 30:31.318
Boris, listen to me, I need you
to stay very still

30:31.320 --> 30:33.153
while I find the subclavian vein.

30:33.155 --> 30:34.822
If you move, I will have to restrain you.

30:36.024 --> 30:38.926
- Yeah, I understand it.
- Thank you.

30:38.928 --> 30:41.128
Okay, here we go.

31:11.559 --> 31:13.894
Okay.

31:13.896 --> 31:15.929
Okay, guys, let's remove the pillows

31:15.931 --> 31:18.332
to get him flat and start detoxifying.

31:18.334 --> 31:20.701
Like the hematologist explained,

31:20.703 --> 31:23.604
your deficiency is activated
by specific triggers.

31:23.606 --> 31:25.906
These questions will help identify

31:25.908 --> 31:28.075
what that sensitivity is
for you and your daughter.

31:28.077 --> 31:29.877
Okay, I understand.

31:29.879 --> 31:32.513
Okay, when did you arrive in the Hamptons?

31:32.515 --> 31:34.148
Ten days ago.

31:34.150 --> 31:35.916
We're renting a cottage on covey court.

31:35.918 --> 31:37.518
The one with the blue shutters?

31:37.520 --> 31:39.386
Across from that amazing garden?

31:39.388 --> 31:41.889
Yes. My daughter always wants
to pick their tomatoes.

31:41.891 --> 31:44.791
When I was in the market,
I was looking at that cottage.

31:44.793 --> 31:46.560
In my dreams.

31:46.562 --> 31:47.528
We love it there.

31:47.530 --> 31:48.829
But we're brand-new,

31:48.831 --> 31:50.197
so we got really lucky finding a doctor.

31:50.199 --> 31:51.465
You certainly did.

31:51.467 --> 31:54.201
G6PD is a great catch.

31:54.203 --> 31:55.836
Yeah, Dr. Lawson's amazing.

31:55.838 --> 31:57.804
Do you know him?

31:57.806 --> 32:01.441
Uh, he has an excellent reputation.

32:01.443 --> 32:03.677
Well, he may be stopping by.
He said he was on his way.

32:03.679 --> 32:05.012
Okay, we should get going then.

32:05.014 --> 32:07.014
So have you started any new medications?

32:07.016 --> 32:09.616
No, and I've taken no antimalarials,

32:09.618 --> 32:10.918
and I don't eat beans.

32:10.920 --> 32:12.152
Hank asked me all those questions.

32:12.154 --> 32:13.587
Of course he did.

32:13.589 --> 32:16.256
Those are the likely culprits.

32:16.258 --> 32:17.925
No anti-inflammatories?

32:17.927 --> 32:19.459
- Nope.
- No quinine?

32:19.461 --> 32:20.694
- Nope.
- Okay, well,

32:20.696 --> 32:23.463
then I will share these with...

32:23.465 --> 32:26.500
Jane, your neighbor's garden,

32:26.502 --> 32:28.168
do you do any gardening there?

32:28.170 --> 32:30.604
I have the opposite of a green thumb.

32:30.606 --> 32:32.506
No, no, no, the closest
I come to that garden

32:32.508 --> 32:34.141
is cooling down there after my daily run.

32:34.143 --> 32:37.044
Do you know, are there any legumes,

32:37.046 --> 32:39.379
beans of any kind at all,
growing in that garden?

32:39.381 --> 32:41.381
Maybe, yeah.

32:41.383 --> 32:42.950
Why?

32:42.952 --> 32:44.818
We may have found your trigger.

32:55.029 --> 32:56.964
We're setting up a lab across the hall

32:56.966 --> 33:00.434
to monitor your blood chemistry.

33:00.436 --> 33:05.138
You're still tachycardic,
so I'm pushing fluids.

33:05.140 --> 33:07.207
Yeah.

33:07.209 --> 33:08.742
I don't want to start forced diuresis

33:08.744 --> 33:11.345
until we know
what toxin we're dealing with.

33:11.347 --> 33:14.147
Here, here, here, let me help you.

33:15.850 --> 33:16.883
Easy.

33:16.885 --> 33:18.619
Just try to relax.

33:18.621 --> 33:20.387
That's it.

33:35.737 --> 33:38.739
Polyneuropathy, gastroenteritis,

33:38.741 --> 33:43.076
alopecia, dystrophy of the nails.

33:46.347 --> 33:49.283
Yeah, Jill, have your lab
test for thallium.

33:49.285 --> 33:51.285
Thallium? That's a lethal toxicant.

33:51.287 --> 33:52.686
He's still making urine.

33:52.688 --> 33:54.221
I'm hoping we can reverse it

33:54.223 --> 33:56.123
before permanent liver or kidney damage.

33:56.125 --> 33:57.658
Hank, this must be criminal.

33:57.660 --> 33:59.626
Thallium isn't found naturally in the U.S.

33:59.628 --> 34:00.594
Yeah.

34:00.596 --> 34:02.229
We're setting up a lab here,

34:02.231 --> 34:03.897
but for now I'm dependent
on your guys to confirm.

34:03.899 --> 34:05.866
Done. I will notify the authorities

34:05.868 --> 34:07.467
and mobilize poison control.

34:07.469 --> 34:10.704
Okay, does your pharmacy stock
the antidote prussian blue?

34:10.706 --> 34:14.241
I'll check and call you right back.

34:14.243 --> 34:15.976
Okay, and, Jill, see if you can find Divya.

34:15.978 --> 34:17.344
I could use her help.

34:17.346 --> 34:21.148
Um... I'm on it.

34:21.150 --> 34:22.449
Thank you.

34:34.295 --> 34:37.264
- Where are they?
- Boris' bedroom.

34:40.668 --> 34:43.070
Hank. What can I do?

34:43.072 --> 34:44.603
Double glove first and gown up.

34:44.606 --> 34:46.139
Take precautions with all output fluids.

34:46.141 --> 34:48.208
We're dealing with
a highly toxic substance here.

34:48.210 --> 34:49.609
Okay.

34:51.612 --> 34:53.612
Poison control's trying
to locate prussian blue.

34:53.614 --> 34:56.016
They're an hour,
maybe two away, best case.

34:56.018 --> 34:57.818
Well, are they the only source?

34:57.820 --> 34:59.086
I mean, every minute counts now.

34:59.088 --> 35:00.620
I read that prussian blue

35:00.622 --> 35:02.289
is used in industrial dyes,

35:02.291 --> 35:04.491
so, as a backup plan, I put
feelers out to the community.

35:04.493 --> 35:06.927
But, so far, no luck.

35:06.929 --> 35:09.596
Okay. Okay.

35:32.820 --> 35:34.855
Ah.

35:34.857 --> 35:36.256
Dr. Lawson.

35:36.258 --> 35:37.257
Prussian blue?

35:37.259 --> 35:38.592
- Yes.
- Great.

35:38.594 --> 35:40.994
Oh. Okay.

35:40.996 --> 35:43.463
- Thank you very much.
- Good luck.

35:46.868 --> 35:49.136
Boris, I'm gonna lean you
forward a little bit

35:49.138 --> 35:52.472
so we can give you the antidote.

35:52.474 --> 35:54.408
Good.

35:55.843 --> 35:58.311
Here it is.

36:10.057 --> 36:12.459
Okay.

36:16.798 --> 36:19.132
Hey. You needed me?

36:19.134 --> 36:21.435
Agent McCarthy does.

36:21.437 --> 36:22.669
And how's Boris doing?

36:22.671 --> 36:24.004
On his last draw,

36:24.006 --> 36:25.372
his numbers seemed to be turning around.

36:25.374 --> 36:26.706
Looks like he escaped
permanent kidney damage,

36:26.708 --> 36:28.375
and he reports less burning in his feet,

36:28.377 --> 36:30.076
so that's a good sign.

36:30.078 --> 36:32.112
The agents are testing all
the food and drink in the house,

36:32.114 --> 36:34.481
as well as lotions, shampoos.

36:34.483 --> 36:35.949
Excuse me. I need to know

36:35.951 --> 36:39.186
food, drinking, drugs.

36:39.188 --> 36:41.388
Dieter, his personal assistant,

36:41.390 --> 36:43.056
is the man to talk to.

36:43.058 --> 36:46.092
I do know Boris smokes cigars,
but that's about it.

36:46.094 --> 36:47.861
- Deb. Humidor?
- Yeah?

36:47.863 --> 36:49.930
In his office. Upstairs.

36:49.932 --> 36:51.765
Check that out.

36:51.767 --> 36:55.268
Hank, the agents need
to test you as well.

36:55.270 --> 36:57.370
As soon as Boris is stable, yeah, sure.

36:57.372 --> 36:58.872
I heard you got some blood on you.

36:58.874 --> 37:00.841
Yeah, it was a brief exposure.

37:00.843 --> 37:02.843
My hands only went numb for a moment.

37:02.845 --> 37:05.479
I wasn't immersed in it.

37:05.481 --> 37:07.180
Hold on.

37:11.385 --> 37:14.354
Thallium can be absorbed through the skin.

37:14.356 --> 37:16.356
Absolutely.

37:19.760 --> 37:22.696
Have your team check the pool.

37:42.192 --> 37:44.427
Marisa was relieved
to hear about your progress.

37:44.429 --> 37:46.395
She wanted me to reassure you

37:46.397 --> 37:48.464
that she and Carlos are safe

37:48.466 --> 37:50.900
and looking forward
to talking to you later.

37:50.902 --> 37:55.438
And she was happy to hear
that this was delivered.

38:00.344 --> 38:01.711
Thank you.

38:01.713 --> 38:04.180
You take care, Boris.

38:06.316 --> 38:09.819
So prussian blue

38:09.821 --> 38:12.588
combined with hemoperfusion is reducing

38:12.590 --> 38:14.457
the thallium's half-life to a few days.

38:14.459 --> 38:16.859
You can expect a full recovery.

38:16.861 --> 38:19.195
That's good news. Thank you, Hank.

38:19.197 --> 38:21.297
Even better news is none
of your symptoms were connected

38:21.299 --> 38:23.699
to your genetic mutation.

38:23.701 --> 38:25.735
The attempted homicide

38:25.737 --> 38:28.704
is still a bit sobering, though.

38:28.706 --> 38:31.207
Boris, there's a phenomenon
with the VCP gene

38:31.209 --> 38:33.109
that I want to discuss with Marisa.

38:33.111 --> 38:38.548
But certain changes can occur
known as VOUS mutations.

38:38.550 --> 38:42.351
V-O-U-S... Variance
Of Unknown Significance.

38:42.353 --> 38:46.255
These mutations may not be
harmful or signal a disease.

38:46.257 --> 38:47.823
What are you saying?

38:47.825 --> 38:50.593
Thallium is an age-old poison...

38:50.595 --> 38:52.395
odorless, tasteless.

38:52.397 --> 38:57.133
It's been used to sicken victims
for generations,

38:57.135 --> 39:00.202
maybe as long
as your family's been divided.

39:00.204 --> 39:02.738
A conspiracy?

39:04.942 --> 39:06.842
Huh.

39:06.844 --> 39:10.446
Are you suggesting that
I may have inherited a mutation

39:10.448 --> 39:11.881
but not a disease?

39:11.883 --> 39:15.518
It's worth considering.

39:15.520 --> 39:16.986
For now, rest.

39:16.988 --> 39:18.621
No more questions.

39:18.623 --> 39:20.957
I have one question.

39:22.993 --> 39:24.894
Where's Dieter?

39:29.866 --> 39:31.801
Thank you.

39:33.937 --> 39:35.671
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:35.673 --> 39:38.074
His creatinine level is almost high normal.

39:38.076 --> 39:39.709
Good.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.010
Okay.

39:41.012 --> 39:42.578
You should go home, get some rest.

39:42.580 --> 39:45.214
You first. I've gotten a second wind.

39:45.216 --> 39:47.483
And once I'm down,
I may be out for the count.

39:47.485 --> 39:49.151
All right.

39:49.153 --> 39:50.653
I'll take you up on that. Thank you.

39:50.655 --> 39:53.356
Oh, I wanted to tell you,
I got a message.

39:53.358 --> 39:56.225
The marathon runner,
the new patient I mentioned,

39:56.227 --> 39:58.327
turns out she has a G6PD anemia,

39:58.329 --> 40:00.796
and she got this amazing diagnosis.

40:00.798 --> 40:03.065
Guess what the trigger is?

40:03.067 --> 40:04.734
Fava beans.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.168
Favism.

40:06.170 --> 40:09.071
And get this, she didn't have
to eat the beans.

40:09.073 --> 40:11.140
She just ran through a field
where they were growing,

40:11.142 --> 40:13.843
and the pollen provoked
the hemolytic event.

40:13.845 --> 40:16.846
Wow. Wow, that's amazing.

40:16.848 --> 40:19.482
I know. Have you even
heard of such a thing?

40:19.484 --> 40:21.984
Jane said some nurse at Hamptons
Heritage figured it out.

40:21.986 --> 40:23.486
Oh, I wouldn't have guessed that.

40:23.488 --> 40:25.521
I feel like sending
that nurse some flowers.

40:25.523 --> 40:26.922
Maybe Jill can ask who was on duty...

40:26.924 --> 40:28.958
You know what, I'll take care of it.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.861
Yeah. You go get some sleep.

40:31.863 --> 40:33.896
Okay.

40:43.741 --> 40:45.541
Hey, Ev.

40:45.543 --> 40:50.479
Are you loving this cool breeze? Huh?

40:50.481 --> 40:53.249
Hey, how's the modeling career?

40:53.251 --> 40:55.951
A little career advice...

40:55.953 --> 40:58.054
don't sell yourself short, okay?

40:58.056 --> 41:00.089
Listen to me now.

41:00.091 --> 41:04.627
You don't get out of bed
for less than $10,000 a day.

41:04.629 --> 41:07.830
Hello?

41:07.832 --> 41:10.166
Ev?

41:10.168 --> 41:11.767
You're not moving.

41:11.769 --> 41:13.769
This concerns me.

41:19.843 --> 41:21.277
What's wrong?

41:24.848 --> 41:28.184
I texted. I called.

41:28.186 --> 41:30.586
I left voice mails.

41:30.588 --> 41:31.721
For Paige?

41:31.723 --> 41:33.389
Yeah.

41:33.391 --> 41:35.991
And then when I finally
talked to her last night,

41:35.993 --> 41:39.995
she said she was hanging
with her parents.

41:39.997 --> 41:42.998
Okay, well, they are close.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.669
Except the general just called,

41:46.671 --> 41:48.604
looking for her.

41:48.606 --> 41:52.441
Annoyed that I was monopolizing her.

41:52.443 --> 41:54.777
He thinks she's been with me.

41:58.982 --> 42:01.717
Maybe you were right, Henry.

42:03.286 --> 42:05.788
Maybe I don't know her.

42:08.760 --> 42:12.461
Maybe I don't know her at all.
