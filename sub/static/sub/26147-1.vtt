06:41.703 --> 06:43.433
Welcome to Monday!

06:43.703 --> 06:47.914
- Have they gone in already?
- Yeah. Half an hour ago.

06:49.064 --> 06:54.064
- Did you call hospitality?
- Oh. I thought you were doing that!

06:58.174 --> 07:02.174
So that's the point I was making about
people knowing where they fit in.

07:03.064 --> 07:07.234
The other one might be busy but,
ultimately, you would get by.

08:39.366 --> 08:41.077
Mr. Pitman's office.

08:42.827 --> 08:44.287
Kelly.

08:46.778 --> 08:48.278
Kelly!

08:48.468 --> 08:49.968
Phone.

08:53.108 --> 08:56.908
Hello? Fuck!

08:57.068 --> 09:02.068
Dude, I know.
I know.

09:03.028 --> 09:07.168
Is she getting any cravings yet?

09:10.488 --> 09:14.989
She's starting to look massive!
Do you think it's his?

09:16.069 --> 09:18.589
No way is it!

09:19.229 --> 09:23.469
A boy, I think. But she wants a girl.

09:24.409 --> 09:27.429
Phil's gonna go ape when he finds out!

09:28.959 --> 09:30.969
Did you see him at the wedding?

09:31.599 --> 09:35.009
That kid is gonna be totally
fucked up by the time it's sixteen.

09:48.360 --> 09:53.190
Vanessa, there is absolutely no difference
between the ground and the instant.

09:54.100 --> 09:55.850
Well, you go and buy it then!

09:56.920 --> 10:01.350
It's cheaper. It's instant. And it's fine!

10:03.640 --> 10:06.590
Is this really about the coffee, Vanessa?

10:07.610 --> 10:11.790
Oh, because that's the most
important thing in your life right now.

10:12.110 --> 10:16.431
Apart from Jeremy Kyle.
Maybe he likes it ground!

10:16.741 --> 10:20.091
- Excuse me. Could I have a cigarette?
- Yeah. Sure.

11:50.234 --> 11:51.274
Cora?

11:56.824 --> 11:58.324
Hello.

12:00.044 --> 12:01.544
Rose.

12:02.784 --> 12:05.994
- Oh, hey!
- Thought it was you!

12:06.834 --> 12:08.834
So... how's things?

12:09.914 --> 12:12.454
- Fine.
- Good!

12:14.254 --> 12:17.713
- Everything's... OK?
- Yes.

12:17.715 --> 12:19.235
Oh, that's good.

12:23.185 --> 12:27.395
- How are things with you?
- Oh, everything's fine, thanks.

12:27.835 --> 12:29.835
Can't complain.

12:32.785 --> 12:34.475
Doing some "DIY"?

12:36.295 --> 12:38.595
No. I was just looking.

12:39.315 --> 12:44.566
Birthday present? Leave it to
them, that's what I say.

12:44.576 --> 12:48.256
Mine spends so much time in the
garage he might as well sleep there.

12:53.926 --> 12:55.516
So you're not at work today?

12:56.576 --> 13:00.516
- I left early.
- Oh, right. Right...

13:01.036 --> 13:05.036
So... you are back at work now then.

13:11.076 --> 13:15.137
Well, I'd better be getting on.
I've got to pick up Sebastian.

13:15.667 --> 13:19.167
They grow up so fast, don't they?

13:22.577 --> 13:26.577
Well, it was nice to see you.
You're looking really well.

13:28.097 --> 13:32.427
We should all get together
again soon. Give me a call?

13:32.567 --> 13:35.717
- I will.
- OK. I'll see you around.

21:41.093 --> 21:42.083
"Do you think it's his?"

21:42.093 --> 21:43.083
"Do you think it's his?"
"Do you think it's his?"

21:43.093 --> 21:44.084
"Do you think it's his?" "Do you think
it's his?" "Do you think it's his?"

21:44.094 --> 21:45.084
"Do you think it's his?" "Do you think it's
his?" "Do you think it's his?" "So fucked up."

21:45.094 --> 21:46.084
"Do you think it's his?" "Do you think it's his?" "Do
you think it's his?" "So fucked up." "So fucked up."

21:46.094 --> 21:47.084
"Do you think it's his?" "Do you think it's his?" "Do you think
it's his?" "So fucked up." "So fucked up." "So fucked up."

21:47.094 --> 21:48.084
"Do you think it's his?" "Do you think it's his?" "Do you think it's his?"
"So fucked up." "So fucked up." "So fucked up." "Do you think it's his?"

21:48.094 --> 21:48.734
"Do you think it's his?" "Do you think it's his?" "Do you think it's his?" "So fucked
up." "So fucked up." "So fucked up." "Do you think it's his?" "Do you think it's his?"

22:01.494 --> 22:05.914
Daniel? It's Cora.

22:09.614 --> 22:11.614
Yes, it has.

22:12.134 --> 22:14.635
Oh, not much. I'm just on
lunch at the moment.

22:17.275 --> 22:19.275
No, in the office.

22:22.375 --> 22:25.125
I told Mum ages ago. She didn't tell you?

22:28.705 --> 22:30.705
So how are you, anyway?

22:33.995 --> 22:35.995
And how's... Susan?

22:39.915 --> 22:42.415
I know. Well, I thought I'd just ask.

22:44.416 --> 22:46.416
Well, I can understand why.

22:51.336 --> 22:53.836
How are the twins, anyway?

22:56.976 --> 22:59.476
Yes, she's into all that, isn't she?

23:02.416 --> 23:03.916
That's nice.

23:23.877 --> 23:25.377
OK, bye.

23:53.438 --> 23:54.938
'Night!

27:34.215 --> 27:36.215
Hello?

30:11.790 --> 30:15.791
Thank you!

32:59.416 --> 33:03.556
- All right, sweetheart?
- Oh, you're so impatient!

33:03.596 --> 33:07.916
- What are you doing?
- You wanted a coffee.

33:07.956 --> 33:09.956
- Two sugars, please.

33:12.436 --> 33:16.897
- Thank you. See you later.
- Bye!

34:47.580 --> 34:50.580
Come in.

34:51.710 --> 34:55.710
- Do you want another one?
- Whatever you're having.

34:56.340 --> 34:59.340
- There's nowhere you need to be tonight?
- No.

35:05.380 --> 35:08.380
Sit down.

35:17.281 --> 35:19.031
Cheers.

35:30.551 --> 35:33.041
So Van's an interesting name.

35:37.031 --> 35:41.261
You know, I have European
relatives. Danish, I think.

35:44.342 --> 35:47.122
Distant cousins, possibly.

36:22.683 --> 36:25.683
It's all right. I'm not expecting anybody else.

36:32.733 --> 36:35.363
Do you want money?

36:39.013 --> 36:41.523
That's not what I meant.

37:02.984 --> 37:05.484
There's that look again.

37:06.444 --> 37:08.244
What look?

37:08.914 --> 37:11.914
The one from before.

37:14.785 --> 37:16.685
Do you smoke?

37:16.825 --> 37:20.685
Sure. Do you want one of mine?

37:38.715 --> 37:41.645
I must confess - I don't usually do
this kind of thing.

37:42.916 --> 37:44.446
So why are you?

37:44.896 --> 37:50.286
Oh, girls just wanna have fun and take
what you can get, and all that.

37:53.596 --> 37:55.246
Sorry.

37:55.436 --> 37:58.186
I don't know what I'm saying.

38:00.066 --> 38:02.566
Then don't say anything.

40:39.631 --> 40:44.092
Cora? Cora!

40:45.392 --> 40:48.070
- Thought you'd left us there for a moment.
- Sorry.

40:48.072 --> 40:50.572
Have you got that proposal?

40:51.122 --> 40:54.132
Yes.... I'll bring it in.

41:28.933 --> 41:35.813
- Mr. Pitman. The proposal you wanted.
- Thank you, Cora. Oh, one moment, please.

41:37.313 --> 41:39.493
Mistakes here...

41:39.843 --> 41:44.094
- Is everything all right?
- Yes.

41:44.704 --> 41:46.204
Sure?

41:50.354 --> 41:53.854
Is there anything you need to talk to me about?

42:00.854 --> 42:04.854
You know, if anything was wrong.
If you're not happy here.

42:05.344 --> 42:08.344
No, I'm fine. Really.

42:10.894 --> 42:13.895
Well, all right, then.

45:01.740 --> 45:03.740
What?

45:18.501 --> 45:20.501
Shit!

45:50.642 --> 45:52.942
How's work?

45:54.912 --> 45:58.622
- As good as that, eh?
- It's fine, mum.

46:01.202 --> 46:03.422
What do you do now?

46:05.852 --> 46:08.422
Office job. I told you.

46:09.292 --> 46:11.792
I lose track.

46:15.663 --> 46:17.413
Busy?

46:22.343 --> 46:26.343
- Are you in charge of anyone?
- Not really.

46:30.443 --> 46:32.983
What happened about that... "thing"?

46:34.503 --> 46:36.503
What "thing"?

46:36.583 --> 46:40.383
Wasn't there some sort of
promotion "thing"?

46:43.664 --> 46:47.664
Yeah. It didn't work out.

46:48.744 --> 46:51.744
Oh. Never mind.

47:16.445 --> 47:19.445
I hear you spoke to Daniel.

47:30.085 --> 47:35.425
- I'm going up to see them in a couple of weeks.
- I'm sure you'll all have a lovely time.

47:45.706 --> 47:47.786
How's Dennis?

47:48.606 --> 47:50.606
Who knows?

47:50.946 --> 47:53.876
- Younger model, huh?
- Watch it, lady!

47:54.146 --> 47:57.906
Well, you don't do yourself
any favours, do you?

47:58.146 --> 48:01.906
Well, nobody does me any
so why should I care?

48:10.946 --> 48:13.447
Are you staying for lunch?

48:15.147 --> 48:17.147
If you're inviting me.

48:17.867 --> 48:19.867
I haven't got much in.

48:31.317 --> 48:34.317
Hello?

48:34.627 --> 48:37.377
Oh... hi, Bernie!

48:38.627 --> 48:41.377
I'm fine.

50:04.150 --> 50:06.230
Can you finish this?

50:08.150 --> 50:10.190
But you haven't eaten anything.

50:12.991 --> 50:15.271
I had a big breakfast.

53:29.127 --> 53:31.917
No, it would just be
for a couple of days.

53:35.917 --> 53:38.917
I don't know. Take them to
the Sage, or something?

53:42.148 --> 53:43.898
I wouldn't.

53:44.938 --> 53:46.688
I wouldn't!

53:49.598 --> 53:51.978
There are plenty of hotels.

53:54.328 --> 53:56.328
She doesn't have to see me.

53:57.118 --> 53:59.118
I can meet them in town.

54:03.008 --> 54:05.758
So you don't want me to come up?

54:12.119 --> 54:14.619
But that's ridiculous!

54:16.609 --> 54:18.079
Daniel...!

54:20.919 --> 54:22.419
Daniel...

57:10.304 --> 57:12.525
My grandma used to feed
me when I was small.

57:17.465 --> 57:22.265
We stayed with her a lot after Daniel was born.
My dad would take us for the weekend.

57:23.175 --> 57:25.175
Sometimes the entire week.

57:26.135 --> 57:30.835
- Where was your mother?
- She was...

57:32.485 --> 57:34.525
She was somewhere else.

57:39.605 --> 57:43.606
Grandma used to boil me an egg and
turn the inside out into a bowl.

57:43.906 --> 57:47.566
She'd heat up the bowl so
the egg didn't get cold.

57:49.086 --> 57:52.686
I remember asking her why the strips
of bread were called "soldiers".

57:52.846 --> 57:55.886
She said Grandad looked like
that during the war.

58:00.896 --> 58:02.246
Is she dead?

58:07.986 --> 58:09.486
Why did you ask me that?

58:15.277 --> 58:16.847
Yes, she's gone.

58:19.147 --> 58:20.567
Dead.

58:21.357 --> 58:23.857
Yes. Dead.

58:29.507 --> 58:31.287
How did she die?

58:37.327 --> 58:39.327
She had a stroke.

58:41.277 --> 58:45.278
Mum wanted to put her in a home afterwards
but my nan was having none of it.

58:46.418 --> 58:50.418
She'd lived through the Blitz so thought
she could survive anything.

58:51.708 --> 58:55.708
Then one day we went round to her house
because we hadn't seen her in a while.

58:58.608 --> 59:03.878
And there she was on the kitchen
floor... with the radio still on.

59:13.669 --> 59:15.209
You cried.

59:18.299 --> 59:21.299
I think everyone needs to cry
sometimes, don't they?

59:30.219 --> 59:33.349
The stupidest thing is the
next day I saw a fox.

59:37.529 --> 59:40.449
And it was just strolling along
in broad daylight.

59:41.630 --> 59:47.220
It stopped and looked right in my eye before running off into the woods.

59:47.470 --> 59:50.470
And all I can remember thinking is...

59:52.550 --> 59:55.050
...what if that was my grandma?

59:56.560 --> 59:58.060
Maybe it was.

01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:09.300
Do you want one?
It's instant but drinkable.

01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:12.871
Green tea.

01:00:14.671 --> 01:00:18.211
Don't reboil the water.

01:00:23.071 --> 01:00:25.821
So you never told me where you lived.

01:00:27.401 --> 01:00:30.401
- Here and there.
- What does that mean?

01:00:31.931 --> 01:00:34.171
It means things change.

01:00:34.591 --> 01:00:36.591
That must make things difficult.

01:00:39.751 --> 01:00:41.491
For who?

01:00:51.352 --> 01:00:56.952
- Everyone needs somewhere to settle.
- Does it need to be made of stone?

01:00:57.412 --> 01:01:00.912
So you move around a lot like a traveller?

01:01:02.362 --> 01:01:05.362
- Not like a traveller.
- Like what then?

01:01:19.313 --> 01:01:22.313
Am I the one supposed to
do all the work here?

01:01:26.353 --> 01:01:28.733
The tea will be ready.

01:01:45.164 --> 01:01:48.662
Strictly speaking, you should steep
the teabag for seven minutes...

01:01:48.664 --> 01:01:52.414
...to maximize the release of antioxidants.

01:02:08.614 --> 01:02:10.814
I don't drink the stuff.

01:02:14.615 --> 01:02:18.365
- You should.
- So people tell me.

01:02:18.785 --> 01:02:22.785
I just wish they'd let me poison
myself with the caffeine.

01:03:06.496 --> 01:03:09.246
You never told me what line
of work you're in.

01:03:09.306 --> 01:03:11.056
Why do you need to know?

01:03:12.037 --> 01:03:13.537
I don't.

01:03:16.747 --> 01:03:18.847
I just like to know who I'm fucking.

01:03:24.937 --> 01:03:26.437
Thank you.

01:03:56.978 --> 01:04:00.218
Everyone has a place within
the order of things.

01:04:01.458 --> 01:04:02.708
What?

01:04:03.228 --> 01:04:04.618
People.

01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:06.708
Their lives.

01:04:06.778 --> 01:04:11.278
They're all intertwined. Connected.

01:04:14.639 --> 01:04:18.139
Each serving a specific purpose.

01:04:18.749 --> 01:04:22.249
Continuously shaping the
face of the world...

01:04:22.839 --> 01:04:26.339
...and impacting on each other's existences.

01:04:29.619 --> 01:04:31.619
Except they don't see it.

01:04:34.089 --> 01:04:36.089
The world is what it is.

01:04:36.389 --> 01:04:40.739
We're here and then we're not.
That's the end of it.

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:44.140
You look at it from the
wrong perspective.

01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:49.250
I look at it from my perspective.

01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:54.250
You should look at the world around you.

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:56.440
Really see it.

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:02.260
Observe it with a detached awareness.

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:07.380
And not run off into the woods.

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:10.240
Have you ever done that?

01:05:13.811 --> 01:05:15.811
I've tried to.

01:05:17.641 --> 01:05:19.641
What did you see?

01:05:30.091 --> 01:05:32.591
Only things I didn't want to see.

01:07:05.804 --> 01:07:07.304
What's wrong?

01:09:32.209 --> 01:09:34.209
There have been...

01:09:36.609 --> 01:09:40.189
There have been one or two "holes".

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:46.520
Recently.

01:10:57.052 --> 01:10:58.052
Hello?

01:10:59.342 --> 01:11:00.342
Yes.

01:11:02.632 --> 01:11:03.632
Oh.

01:11:06.512 --> 01:11:08.512
What, now?

01:11:12.443 --> 01:11:14.443
Sure. OK.

01:12:28.335 --> 01:12:32.835
Well, I'm hard-working,
passionate and loyal.

01:12:32.895 --> 01:12:37.395
In my last job I developed a system
that resulted in significant savings...

01:12:37.515 --> 01:12:43.016
...but certain circumstances led to my departure and now I'm looking for new opportunities.

01:12:57.176 --> 01:13:00.846
Yes, I have supervised
staff in the past.

01:13:01.556 --> 01:13:07.266
And I hope that I'll eventually grow into
a position of such responsibility.

01:13:30.117 --> 01:13:34.617
I think it's important that management are understanding of employees' needs.

01:13:34.697 --> 01:13:40.357
I appreciate an environment where supervisors make personal connections with their staff.

01:13:40.417 --> 01:13:44.838
But I believe there's room for personal
relationships in the workplace.

01:13:44.958 --> 01:13:46.958
They just have to be...

01:13:48.218 --> 01:13:50.218
..."handled" discretely.

01:13:51.718 --> 01:13:56.868
Yes, I pride myself on my
level of discretion...

01:13:58.758 --> 01:14:02.258
...especially in such a male-
dominated environment.

01:14:04.358 --> 01:14:10.108
No, if I were to cross the line I would
want something in return.

01:14:14.589 --> 01:14:18.339
I don't know. It depends
on what's on offer.

01:14:20.829 --> 01:14:26.829
Given the right circumstances
I can be very proficient.

01:14:35.089 --> 01:14:36.089
So...

01:14:36.899 --> 01:14:39.399
How do you want me?

01:15:16.951 --> 01:15:18.951
Daniel, it's Cora.

01:15:20.131 --> 01:15:22.131
Pick up the phone.

01:15:25.181 --> 01:15:27.431
I know you can hear me.

01:15:29.361 --> 01:15:31.611
Pick up the phone, please!

01:16:06.242 --> 01:16:08.602
Why do you look
at me like that?

01:16:10.202 --> 01:16:12.963
I like watching beautiful things.

01:16:15.403 --> 01:16:16.653
Sorry.

01:16:28.353 --> 01:16:30.163
We know nothing about each other.

01:16:30.323 --> 01:16:32.523
- It's better that way.
- Why?

01:16:32.993 --> 01:16:34.563
Because it is.

01:16:41.084 --> 01:16:43.244
What do you want from me?

01:16:44.184 --> 01:16:45.804
Only yourself.

01:17:00.604 --> 01:17:02.564
Someone died.

01:17:06.464 --> 01:17:08.364
And it was my fault.

01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:39.541
- Do you have any investments?
- No.

01:20:40.562 --> 01:20:44.312
Sometimes I think that if you're careful with your money...

01:20:44.712 --> 01:20:47.992
...and you make the right investments,
you can't go wrong.

01:20:49.612 --> 01:20:51.612
Even in this climate.

01:20:52.312 --> 01:20:55.912
In fact, recession is often the best
time to make a few quid.

01:20:56.112 --> 01:20:58.612
Certainly in the investment
banking world.

01:21:00.182 --> 01:21:03.932
Listen, if you ever change your
mind about investments...

01:21:05.992 --> 01:21:08.492
What did you say your
name was again?

01:21:08.692 --> 01:21:10.693
It's Kelly.

01:22:48.568 --> 01:22:50.566
I love you.

01:26:48.228 --> 01:26:51.342
"So Van's an interesting name."

01:26:51.344 --> 01:26:54.848
"Everyone has a place within
the order of things."

01:26:56.144 --> 01:26:59.144
"We know nothing about each other."

01:26:59.384 --> 01:27:02.882
"Everyone has a place within
the order of things."

01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:04.884
"It means things change."

01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:08.104
"So Van's an interesting name."

01:27:08.614 --> 01:27:10.369
"Everyone has a place..."

01:27:10.865 --> 01:27:12.865
"So Van's an interesting name."

01:27:47.966 --> 01:27:51.464
"Everyone has a place within
the order of things."

01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:45.698
Cora?

01:29:17.461 --> 01:29:18.959
Cora?

01:34:04.238 --> 01:34:09.238
...WILL RETURN

01:34:17.796 --> 01:34:22.796
