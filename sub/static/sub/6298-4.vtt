00:08.865 --> 00:10.603
<i>The sentence is banishment.</i>

00:10.604 --> 00:12.005
<i>Cardinal Versucci</i>
<i>will be stripped</i>

00:12.039 --> 00:13.573
<i>and his property</i>
<i>will be donated</i>

00:13.674 --> 00:16.473
<i>to our Holy Mother Church.</i>

00:16.507 --> 00:18.139
<i>Cardinal</i>
<i>Versucci was the last person</i>

00:18.206 --> 00:19.306
<i>in the room.</i>

00:19.374 --> 00:20.674
<i>No one can find him.</i>

00:20.741 --> 00:22.842
<i>May I introduce</i>
<i>Francesco Gonzaga,</i>

00:22.877 --> 00:24.276
<i>Duke of Mantua,</i>

00:24.311 --> 00:26.947
<i>and his bride,</i>
<i>the lovely Bianca.</i>

00:26.981 --> 00:28.314
Divine indeed.

00:28.382 --> 00:29.682
You know what I want.

00:29.750 --> 00:31.583
You wish your son
to be acknowledged.

00:31.651 --> 00:32.950
To separate a mother
from her child -

00:33.051 --> 00:34.218
Her bastard child.

00:34.286 --> 00:35.419
My feelings on that matter

00:35.487 --> 00:38.222
have already been made
abundantly clear.

00:38.290 --> 00:40.225
You sat there,
meek as a girl,

00:40.326 --> 00:42.227
and said not one word.

00:42.295 --> 00:43.896
<i>Catherina Sforza Riario,</i>

00:43.963 --> 00:45.565
<i>Countess of Forli.</i>

00:45.599 --> 00:49.035
We had almost lost hope
of having you kneel before us.

00:49.069 --> 00:50.470
<i>You invite her here?</i>

00:50.504 --> 00:53.507
<i>Into the heart of Rome onto</i>
<i>the steps of the Vatican</i>

00:53.575 --> 00:55.042
<i>for the whole world to see?</i>

00:55.143 --> 00:56.678
My invitation
of Catherina Sforza

00:56.712 --> 00:57.913
is a move in the game -

00:57.981 --> 01:00.516
<i>as is your marriage</i>
<i>to the pope's daughter.</i>

01:00.551 --> 01:01.884
<i>My marriage is no game.</i>

01:01.952 --> 01:03.886
<i>I love Lucrezia.</i>

01:03.921 --> 01:05.722
Who did this?

01:05.790 --> 01:07.090
Only my brother would've -

01:07.158 --> 01:08.726
Is this what I am
to your brother?

01:08.760 --> 01:10.194
A question mark?

01:10.228 --> 01:12.196
Is this what I am
to your family?

01:12.264 --> 01:13.997
I would confound this pope.

01:14.065 --> 01:15.699
<i>Our little pack of wolves.</i>

01:15.733 --> 01:17.267
<i>If they pledge</i>
<i>their swords to me,</i>

01:17.335 --> 01:19.369
<i>and the Borgia estates</i>
<i>I'll divide among them.</i>

01:21.372 --> 01:23.105
What on God's earth?

01:23.173 --> 01:25.074
Am I so hard to love?

01:25.108 --> 01:28.076
Only a Borgia, it seems,
can truly love a Borgia.

01:28.111 --> 01:29.478
Why deny ourselves the pleasure

01:29.545 --> 01:31.813
of which we're already accused?

<i>Alessandro Farnese,</i>

03:25.963 --> 03:31.167
with the dignity of Cardinal
of the Holy Roman Church.

03:31.201 --> 03:34.336
Receive this ring
from the hand of Peter

03:34.437 --> 03:36.939
and know that
through the love

03:36.973 --> 03:38.213
of the Prince
of the Apostles...

03:38.241 --> 03:39.875
Who is he?

03:39.943 --> 03:43.780
Your love towards the
church is strengthened.

03:43.881 --> 03:46.149
Remember Pope's
whore, Giulia Farnese?

03:47.484 --> 03:49.719
<i>That's the brother.</i>

03:49.787 --> 03:51.521
God help us all.

03:52.589 --> 03:53.856
You shall report
to Cardinal Grimani

03:53.891 --> 03:55.424
who is in charge
of the Treasury.

03:55.492 --> 03:57.733
We need a comprehensive account
of all funds and outlays,

03:57.795 --> 03:59.235
with each transaction
recorded twice.

03:59.263 --> 04:00.997
I am sure you are aware of
the principle of double entry?

04:01.065 --> 04:03.633
Tithes and taxes are garnered in
the Treasury and deposited here;

04:03.701 --> 04:06.169
these dockets
record the amounts,

04:06.237 --> 04:07.604
the various funds,
sub-funds

04:07.638 --> 04:09.639
and sub-funds of sub-funds
to which the amounts are due.

04:09.707 --> 04:11.808
You will make two books:
one of credit, one of debit.

04:11.876 --> 04:13.176
This is your desk.

04:13.210 --> 04:14.678
<i>Here.</i>

04:16.180 --> 04:17.515
I'm sure your sister
impressed on you

04:17.548 --> 04:18.815
the importance of
counting the money

04:18.884 --> 04:20.351
before the client has
rinsed off and walked away.

04:22.321 --> 04:24.456
What happened here?

04:25.825 --> 04:28.427
Cardinal Versucci
happened here.

04:32.733 --> 04:40.733
[♪]

04:48.883 --> 04:50.183
Sister...

04:50.284 --> 04:52.085
More water.

04:53.887 --> 04:55.388
There, Brother.

05:04.464 --> 05:06.731
The title deeds
to the alum mines

05:06.766 --> 05:10.301
so graciously transferred
to the Office of Public Works

05:10.369 --> 05:13.738
are now restored,
in perpetuity,

05:13.839 --> 05:15.840
to the Little
Sisters of the Poor.

05:15.908 --> 05:18.743
With all the income
resultant.

05:18.777 --> 05:21.980
You're a strange messenger
to bring such good tidings.

05:22.014 --> 05:24.983
You look like a man
in a hurry.

05:25.051 --> 05:26.986
What is it you are
hurrying from, Father?

05:28.455 --> 05:31.024
Oh, at first I thought
I was hurrying from.

05:31.058 --> 05:34.628
But now, I rather think
I am hurrying towards.

05:34.662 --> 05:36.196
Towards God?

05:37.899 --> 05:41.835
Towards whatever destiny
I have wrought for myself.

05:45.206 --> 05:47.174
So, Rome is well stocked

05:47.208 --> 05:48.575
with cardinals once more.

05:48.676 --> 05:50.177
With loyal cardinals.

05:50.212 --> 05:51.732
When the garden is
overcome with weeds,

05:51.746 --> 05:53.847
it is sometimes best to
burn it down and sow again.

05:53.915 --> 05:55.115
Are they competent?

05:55.216 --> 05:56.683
Do any of them
know their duties?

05:56.718 --> 05:59.586
Their only duty
is loyalty to us.

05:59.654 --> 06:01.855
The rest they can learn
as they go along.

06:01.923 --> 06:03.457
Father,
the envoy from Venice.

06:03.491 --> 06:05.392
What does Venice want?

06:05.493 --> 06:07.494
An audience.
He's been waiting three days.

06:08.830 --> 06:09.930
Ah!

06:10.031 --> 06:12.866
The new bride
finally appears.

06:12.934 --> 06:15.302
How are you,
my dear?

06:15.369 --> 06:17.370
Are you well?

06:17.405 --> 06:18.872
Yes, Father.

06:18.940 --> 06:20.507
Married life suits you?

06:20.574 --> 06:24.411
Last night brought you
everything you could desire?

06:25.579 --> 06:27.681
Oh!

06:27.748 --> 06:29.316
We brought a blush
to your cheeks.

06:29.384 --> 06:33.286
Look, Cesare.
Your sister, the blushing bride.

06:35.923 --> 06:37.157
<i>Well, there we are.</i>

06:47.836 --> 06:50.071
So...

06:50.139 --> 06:52.574
What brings Venice
so far south?

06:52.608 --> 06:54.342
The price of indigo?

06:54.410 --> 06:57.779
The illiberal duties
charged on imports

06:57.880 --> 06:59.614
from the Baltic states?

06:59.682 --> 07:03.118
Or are mosquitoes in the lagoon
getting too much to bear?

07:05.155 --> 07:07.422
It is the Turks,
Your Holiness.

07:07.523 --> 07:08.624
The Turks?

07:08.691 --> 07:10.759
We have lost three
trade convoys this year.

07:10.794 --> 07:13.595
Uh-huh...
Innumerable smaller merchant vessels.

07:13.663 --> 07:15.964
The price of doing business.

07:16.065 --> 07:17.465
This past month
they've been raiding

07:17.500 --> 07:19.134
the coastal towns
along the province.

07:19.169 --> 07:21.336
They've not done that before.

07:21.437 --> 07:24.072
If trade suffers,
we all suffer.

07:24.173 --> 07:25.807
Rome as well.

07:27.175 --> 07:29.510
So Venice's suffering
is Rome's suffering.

07:29.611 --> 07:31.345
Exactly so, Holiness.

07:31.413 --> 07:33.580
Except with rather
more mosquitoes.

07:33.615 --> 07:35.882
Well, we thank you

07:35.950 --> 07:37.951
for bringing our suffering
to our attention.

07:37.985 --> 07:39.886
We were not aware.

07:41.722 --> 07:43.356
We will give
this matter

07:43.424 --> 07:45.692
the consideration
that it merits.

07:48.696 --> 07:50.864
So our cousin
has married the woman

07:50.898 --> 07:54.168
all of Italy talks about.

07:54.269 --> 07:58.505
Who would have thought,
of all those suitors,

07:58.539 --> 08:02.543
she would choose
our little Alfonsito?

08:02.610 --> 08:04.911
You've done well,

08:04.979 --> 08:07.614
for our family
and yourself.

08:07.715 --> 08:09.983
Very, very well,
I might say.

08:12.053 --> 08:14.187
Lucrezia Borgia!

08:14.255 --> 08:16.189
Even a king hears tales.

08:16.223 --> 08:19.092
So tell me...
What's she like?

08:19.127 --> 08:21.995
She is, uh,

08:22.063 --> 08:23.630
kind, and gentle.

08:26.534 --> 08:28.335
You idiot.
Not like that.

08:28.369 --> 08:31.004
I mean in bed.
What's she like in bed?

08:33.341 --> 08:35.808
She's everything you
could wish for, I suppose.

08:35.876 --> 08:38.078
You suppose?

08:38.111 --> 08:41.548
Cousin,
we're men talking here!

08:41.616 --> 08:43.616
I mean,
how does she like it?

08:43.652 --> 08:47.187
Dog style?
Up the back alley?

08:47.288 --> 08:48.655
How?

08:49.724 --> 08:51.258
The usual way.

08:56.898 --> 08:59.266
"The usual way?"

08:59.300 --> 09:01.368
What is it you're
not telling me?

09:01.469 --> 09:03.537
What happened on
your wedding night?

09:05.907 --> 09:07.541
Nothing.

09:07.575 --> 09:10.944
Nothing?
What do you mean, nothing?

09:11.012 --> 09:13.380
Nothing happened.
The marriage wasn't consummated?

09:13.448 --> 09:15.182
Nothing happened!

09:15.216 --> 09:17.117
Nothing happened?
Nothing at all?

09:17.185 --> 09:18.452
But it must happen.

09:18.486 --> 09:22.824
For the sake of both our
families, it must happen.

09:22.858 --> 09:24.458
And it will!

09:24.493 --> 09:27.661
Yes, it most certainly will.

09:33.368 --> 09:35.201
Father.
Your Grace.

09:36.470 --> 09:38.205
Cardinal Farnese.

09:38.306 --> 09:40.774
Your Holiness.

09:40.842 --> 09:42.776
Hard at work, I see.

09:42.844 --> 09:44.578
Yes, Holiness.

09:44.646 --> 09:47.314
I am reconciling
dockets, Holiness.

09:47.382 --> 09:52.186
Ascertaining the true level
of Vatican funds.

09:52.221 --> 09:54.122
Please,
don't let me stop you.

09:58.594 --> 09:59.961
Your sister Giulia

09:59.996 --> 10:02.097
requested that you
be created a cardinal.

10:02.131 --> 10:04.032
Yes, Holiness.

10:04.067 --> 10:05.500
You did not put
yourself forward.

10:05.601 --> 10:07.169
No, Holiness.

10:10.039 --> 10:13.208
Not even to her?

10:13.242 --> 10:17.579
A suggestion,
the merest hint?

10:17.680 --> 10:19.214
No, Holiness.

10:19.248 --> 10:21.416
It - it was her idea.

10:22.418 --> 10:25.521
So, you are not
like the others.

10:25.588 --> 10:27.322
No ambition.

10:27.423 --> 10:30.326
I am deeply honoured by the -
Yes, yes, yes.

10:33.230 --> 10:36.032
She told me that
you have a felicity

10:36.066 --> 10:41.237
for numbers, for accounts.

10:41.305 --> 10:44.775
Which is why
we have placed you

10:44.876 --> 10:47.611
in a position
in our Treasury.

10:47.712 --> 10:49.346
Holiness.

10:53.885 --> 10:56.153
Now listen
to me very carefully.

10:56.221 --> 10:58.589
Yes, Holiness.

10:58.624 --> 11:02.760
You'll not report
to Cardinal Grimani.

11:02.795 --> 11:05.897
You will not report
to Cardinal Sforza.

11:05.965 --> 11:09.267
To none of them.

11:09.335 --> 11:13.538
You will detail the full
extent of Vatican finances,

11:13.606 --> 11:17.242
and your report you
will place in our hands

11:17.310 --> 11:21.681
and our hands alone.

11:21.748 --> 11:24.517
Am I clear?

11:24.618 --> 11:27.721
Yes, Holiness.

11:27.789 --> 11:29.323
Good.

12:00.620 --> 12:04.356
Giulia!
What brings you here?

12:04.424 --> 12:05.825
A sister's
devotion.

12:07.895 --> 12:10.263
Is your head above
the water still?

12:10.364 --> 12:13.066
In truth - I fear the waves
closed over me long ago.

12:19.107 --> 12:21.174
What is this?

12:21.208 --> 12:23.009
I no longer know.

12:23.077 --> 12:25.479
Lies and confusion.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.283
Would sisterly
devotion go so far

12:30.317 --> 12:32.118
as to help me
make sense of it?

12:52.436 --> 12:54.671
Are you awake?

12:54.738 --> 12:56.539
Yes.

12:58.476 --> 13:01.311
I wanted to say I'm sorry
for last night.

13:01.379 --> 13:05.015
I wish it never happened.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.134
Can we pretend
it never happened,

13:23.202 --> 13:25.270
and start anew?

13:46.558 --> 13:48.392
I'm sorry.

13:48.493 --> 13:51.027
I cannot.
I -

13:52.597 --> 13:55.097
We're married now.
We're married.

14:01.739 --> 14:09.046
Last night...

14:09.113 --> 14:11.682
something more happened

14:11.783 --> 14:15.319
than just a question mark
on a place setting.

14:18.322 --> 14:19.789
What happened?

14:27.965 --> 14:30.867
I don't understand.
What else happened?

14:38.075 --> 14:40.243
A cloud descended
on me -

14:42.713 --> 14:45.248
my heart.

14:51.322 --> 14:54.624
Let me lift it then.

15:08.237 --> 15:10.772
Can you feel nothing?

15:11.874 --> 15:14.075
I feel your hand.

15:15.311 --> 15:19.547
Help me...
to love you.

15:19.615 --> 15:21.549
Please - just -

15:25.921 --> 15:29.891
Maybe...

15:29.958 --> 15:34.462
maybe our love has
to be more of the soul.

15:41.170 --> 15:44.005
Like...

15:44.073 --> 15:46.641
brother and sister?

15:49.645 --> 15:52.647
No.
Not like that.

16:04.694 --> 16:06.528
We've been stripped bare.

16:06.562 --> 16:08.730
Yes.

16:08.798 --> 16:11.166
Extraordinary, isn't it?

16:11.200 --> 16:14.469
With such ease.

16:17.840 --> 16:20.375
You're laughing?

16:20.443 --> 16:22.744
Where is the outrage?
The fury?

16:22.845 --> 16:24.012
Because...

16:24.113 --> 16:26.481
we never would have
thought he had it in him.

16:28.918 --> 16:33.922
Oh, we'll replenish
the coffers.

16:34.023 --> 16:37.993
Meanwhile, seek him out,
the old goat.

16:39.029 --> 16:42.632
Teach him the error
of his ways.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.859
Find him.

17:49.937 --> 17:51.605
Leave us.

17:51.706 --> 17:53.841
Holy Father,

17:53.875 --> 17:55.576
if you wish me
to visit you,

17:55.610 --> 17:57.878
you have but
to say the word.

17:57.980 --> 18:01.048
There is no need for
Vatican Guards in the night.

18:08.890 --> 18:12.259
Your handwriting
on Vatican accounts.

18:12.327 --> 18:15.162
Your notes.

18:15.230 --> 18:20.232
Here and here.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.533
Don't try and deny it.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.801
Yes, I was helping
Alessandro to make sense -

18:23.869 --> 18:26.070
You told us he was capable!

18:26.138 --> 18:27.705
That he had a felicity
for numbers!

18:27.806 --> 18:30.507
We took your word!
He does.

18:30.575 --> 18:32.976
That rat's nest of figures
would make a saint weep.

18:33.077 --> 18:35.077
You lied to gain your
brother a position!

18:35.145 --> 18:36.612
He is capable!

18:36.680 --> 18:39.715
Moreover, we ordered
him explicitly

18:39.782 --> 18:41.416
to answer to
no one but us,

18:41.484 --> 18:42.884
and he runs
straight to you!

18:42.985 --> 18:44.885
I was merely helping him!

18:44.953 --> 18:47.354
As I once helped you.

18:49.522 --> 18:50.789
Give me one reason

18:50.857 --> 18:52.691
why we should not have him
defrocked this instant!

18:52.792 --> 18:55.059
There is nothing underhand here.

18:55.094 --> 18:57.159
He could not
understand the numbers.

18:57.226 --> 18:58.506
Could not understand
the numbers!

18:58.527 --> 19:00.528
That is all!
I helped him!

19:00.629 --> 19:02.696
No one else, nothing more.

19:02.797 --> 19:06.065
Just a sister helping
a brother to serve his pope.

19:08.035 --> 19:11.337
But he is a man, is he not?

19:11.438 --> 19:12.905
What do you mean?

19:15.242 --> 19:18.343
Men are false.

19:18.444 --> 19:21.046
We had thought to
purge our Vatican.

19:21.080 --> 19:25.316
As though the fresh
blood of new cardinals

19:25.351 --> 19:27.718
would wash it clean.

19:27.786 --> 19:29.153
But it will not.

19:29.254 --> 19:31.522
New cardinals become
old cardinals,

19:31.557 --> 19:34.792
and it will
all begin again -

19:34.860 --> 19:37.362
the plotting,
the scheming.

19:37.396 --> 19:42.634
We can see it all -
as inevitable as the tide.

19:42.702 --> 19:44.903
You are not yourself,
Holiness.

19:44.971 --> 19:47.273
But we are not
mistaken either.

19:50.344 --> 19:54.080
We are so utterly alone.

19:56.984 --> 20:00.619
You are not alone, Holiness.

20:00.720 --> 20:02.254
How can I prove it?

20:02.288 --> 20:05.056
You can't...

20:05.090 --> 20:09.193
unless you can ensure a loyalty
of an entire Consistory.

20:15.166 --> 20:18.268
If that will bring me
your forgiveness,

20:18.336 --> 20:24.475
and you some peace of mind,
then I shall find a way.

20:42.027 --> 20:44.561
<i>It does require your attention.</i>

20:48.633 --> 20:53.436
You wished to speak to us?
In private?

20:53.471 --> 20:56.306
It's a matter of delicacy,
Holiness,

20:56.340 --> 21:00.710
but a matter that can
no longer go unattended.

21:00.745 --> 21:03.179
Then speak.

21:03.213 --> 21:05.648
The marriage of your
daughter to our cousin.

21:05.749 --> 21:07.583
It has come
to my attention

21:07.618 --> 21:09.585
that it is a marriage
in name only.

21:11.021 --> 21:12.288
Hm?

21:12.356 --> 21:15.024
It is unfulfilled.

21:15.092 --> 21:16.559
Unconsummated.

21:16.626 --> 21:19.762
What?

21:19.830 --> 21:21.130
It's only been a few days.

21:21.197 --> 21:22.931
Still. A few days
become a few weeks

21:22.966 --> 21:24.166
and then come
the lovers.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.835
Do not speak
of our daughter thus.

21:26.936 --> 21:28.303
You are a guest here!

21:28.371 --> 21:31.840
Forgive me, Holiness,
but God himself tells us,

21:31.874 --> 21:33.642
"Thou shalt enter
unto her - "

21:33.676 --> 21:35.010
Do not preach to us
about what God tells us.

21:35.044 --> 21:36.645
"...and thou shalt know her,

21:36.679 --> 21:38.580
and she shall be to
thee for a woman."

21:38.648 --> 21:41.283
Now, unless
this is done,

21:41.317 --> 21:43.185
this marriage
is a sham.

21:43.219 --> 21:45.754
If it is unconsummated,
then whose fault is that?

21:45.855 --> 21:47.489
How am I to tell?

21:47.590 --> 21:50.392
Well, you tell me, you seem
to know everything else!

21:50.460 --> 21:54.229
I will tell you
what I know.

21:54.296 --> 21:57.832
I know your daughter
is married to my kinsman.

21:57.867 --> 22:00.768
Now, he's an honourable man.

22:00.836 --> 22:02.670
Meanwhile, your daughter -

22:02.771 --> 22:04.138
You should -

22:04.205 --> 22:06.774
- has a son already
whose father is unknown.

22:06.841 --> 22:08.742
You tread carefully, sir.

22:08.776 --> 22:10.877
I am careful, my lord.

22:10.945 --> 22:13.146
I am careful of myself
and my family.

22:13.214 --> 22:16.049
Now I will see this
marriage consummated,

22:16.083 --> 22:19.420
lest there be any doubt,
any confusion,

22:19.488 --> 22:21.156
weeks or months hence.

22:21.223 --> 22:22.857
Then just tell your little
cousin to get on with it!

22:22.925 --> 22:24.426
No.

22:24.493 --> 22:26.127
I will take no one's
word on this matter,

22:26.161 --> 22:27.328
do you understand?

22:27.396 --> 22:29.064
There must be proof.

22:33.302 --> 22:35.337
What do you mean, proof?

22:37.140 --> 22:40.142
It is a petty revenge for
the slight you gave him.

22:40.210 --> 22:41.710
It is an insult
to Lucrezia!

22:41.744 --> 22:43.245
It is an insult
to us!

22:43.346 --> 22:44.680
Oh, quieten yourself.

22:44.781 --> 22:46.461
On how many fronts
would you have us fight?

22:46.517 --> 22:49.252
And besides, there
is a precedent.

22:49.353 --> 22:51.321
I will see him burn
for this.

22:51.356 --> 22:53.590
There is a precedent!

22:53.625 --> 22:56.796
It may stick in your gullet
as it sticks in mine,

22:56.897 --> 23:00.701
but when all is said and done,
he is in the right.

23:00.735 --> 23:02.603
Do you honestly think
it matters one jot to me?

23:02.704 --> 23:04.539
Well it should!
It must!

23:04.606 --> 23:06.974
Would you have this
alliance soured with Naples

23:07.009 --> 23:09.076
the moment it is struck?
Huh?

23:15.349 --> 23:19.585
Naples was, and always
will be, an infected swamp.

23:22.989 --> 23:25.691
What about Lucrezia?

23:28.861 --> 23:30.528
She must be told.

23:33.231 --> 23:35.431
I will tell her.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.634
No.

23:38.735 --> 23:40.169
No...

23:42.005 --> 23:43.639
I will.

23:48.077 --> 23:51.779
What perversion
is this?

23:51.814 --> 23:54.649
You would put me on display

23:54.716 --> 23:58.987
for every vile, lecherous
creature to fondle himself to?

23:59.054 --> 24:00.722
We had no choice.

24:00.756 --> 24:04.460
You weak, shameless,
pitiful excuse.

24:04.561 --> 24:06.996
If I was a man I would
have run him through.

24:07.063 --> 24:09.265
I would have cut
out his tongue

24:09.333 --> 24:12.001
before I let him speak about
my own sister in this way.

24:12.036 --> 24:13.357
It was for the
good of the family.

24:13.371 --> 24:16.372
We had no choice.
You had every choice!

24:16.474 --> 24:18.475
Where is your honour?

24:18.543 --> 24:20.109
Where is your strength?

24:20.177 --> 24:22.445
Where is your
love for me?

24:24.781 --> 24:26.115
I love you.

24:38.229 --> 24:40.530
I would have killed him
where he stood.

24:40.564 --> 24:43.366
I would have cut his
heart out of his body.

24:43.401 --> 24:46.002
But I stayed my hand for
the good of the family.

24:52.443 --> 24:55.579
So the King of Naples
is to watch me in bed -

24:55.646 --> 24:57.380
for the good of the family.

25:04.556 --> 25:07.858
Very well...

25:07.926 --> 25:10.362
Very well.

25:10.396 --> 25:12.831
When is it to be?

25:12.865 --> 25:14.766
Tonight.

25:20.406 --> 25:22.574
And from our family
who is to bear witness?

25:22.642 --> 25:24.309
Whomever you wish.

25:32.386 --> 25:34.487
Then I want you.

25:51.403 --> 25:53.337
Just tell us who is who.

25:53.405 --> 25:56.740
<i>Bankers, guilds, merchants.</i>

26:13.759 --> 26:16.161
Dear friends.

26:16.195 --> 26:20.865
We have invited you to break
bread with us tonight,

26:20.933 --> 26:26.338
because the news we bring
affects you most of all.

26:26.405 --> 26:31.777
God is our guide,
but trade is our lifeblood.

26:31.845 --> 26:33.445
<i>Hear, hear.</i>

26:33.513 --> 26:36.348
As bankers,
as merchants,

26:36.415 --> 26:39.050
you know this
best of all.

26:39.151 --> 26:43.221
But a dusky menace
shadows our prosperity.

26:43.255 --> 26:47.525
The Turk threatens our shipping.

26:47.626 --> 26:51.228
Our cousins in Venice
find their storehouses raided,

26:51.263 --> 26:53.430
their cargoes stolen,

26:53.465 --> 26:57.700
their lifeblood
seeping into the sand.

26:57.768 --> 27:02.605
But Venice is suffering.

27:02.673 --> 27:06.409
And I ask you,
if Venice suffers,

27:06.444 --> 27:09.312
does not Rome
suffer also?

27:13.184 --> 27:18.154
We must meet this
menace head on.

27:18.256 --> 27:20.323
With God's help,

27:20.358 --> 27:23.160
we will raise
a Mighty Crusade

27:23.261 --> 27:26.797
to drive the Turk back into
the desert whence he came.

27:28.433 --> 27:31.435
And protect our homeland,

27:31.503 --> 27:35.740
and to sweep the
seas clean once more.

27:35.807 --> 27:40.445
Christ walked upon the water.

27:40.479 --> 27:44.916
If the Infidel
would prevent us,

27:44.984 --> 27:48.887
then we will consign him
to the Gates of Hell!

27:54.627 --> 27:56.361
Venice will do
everything in its power

27:56.429 --> 27:58.263
to be behind this
Crusade, Holiness.

27:58.298 --> 28:00.165
We could not have
asked for more.

28:00.199 --> 28:01.266
Then it is agreed.

28:01.334 --> 28:02.801
In the name of Christ,

28:02.835 --> 28:04.369
we thank you for
your unhesitating

28:04.470 --> 28:06.638
and unstinting support

28:06.739 --> 28:10.376
for this, our Holy War.

28:20.387 --> 28:21.821
In order to fund
the Holy Crusade

28:21.855 --> 28:23.189
against the Turkish Menace,

28:23.257 --> 28:24.657
the following papal
levies are hereby enacted

28:24.692 --> 28:26.726
upon trade goods outgoing
from Rome to Venice,

28:26.761 --> 28:28.261
and incoming from
Venice to Rome -

28:28.295 --> 28:30.196
<i>More taxes?</i>

28:30.231 --> 28:31.731
and also on assets
in coin, note of hand,

28:31.766 --> 28:33.733
drafts upon banking houses,
promissory notes,

28:33.767 --> 28:38.003
gold, silver, precious
metals, and stones.

28:46.914 --> 28:48.482
The matter of which
we spoke before

28:48.550 --> 28:50.451
needs to be set in motion.

28:50.485 --> 28:52.586
Is he ready to
join our cause?

28:52.654 --> 28:54.588
He is.

28:54.656 --> 28:57.291
He has many reasons
to hate Rome.

28:57.359 --> 29:00.294
And does he fully understand
what will be required?

29:00.362 --> 29:02.931
More than that.
He relishes it.

29:06.302 --> 29:09.570
I believe I have found
a way, Holy Father,

29:09.672 --> 29:11.739
to bring you some
peace of mind.

29:11.773 --> 29:12.940
Go on.

29:13.041 --> 29:16.377
You fear treachery.

29:16.411 --> 29:20.648
Now, a compromised man
cannot plan treason.

29:20.682 --> 29:23.417
The sword hangs above
his head day and night;

29:23.485 --> 29:25.786
he never knows
when it may fall.

29:28.557 --> 29:33.228
But if he's compromised,
and weak,

29:33.329 --> 29:35.063
that's when he's loyal.

29:36.232 --> 29:38.500
Go on.

29:38.567 --> 29:40.769
We are listening.

29:40.836 --> 29:42.871
Let me ask you this.

29:42.939 --> 29:46.308
What compromises a man
more than anything else?

29:46.342 --> 29:48.610
His prick.

29:50.980 --> 29:54.783
And the horns of a cuckold
are only sharpened by time.

29:57.754 --> 29:59.421
My Lord Gonzaga.

30:00.857 --> 30:02.958
My lady.

30:04.528 --> 30:06.162
Please, join us.

30:07.464 --> 30:10.133
<i>They are men, Holy Father.</i>

30:10.168 --> 30:13.604
And as you said,
all men are false.

30:13.671 --> 30:15.406
And, because they
are also weak...

30:17.109 --> 30:20.177
I propose a night's
festivities

30:20.245 --> 30:24.081
that might expose just
how weak they are.

30:24.149 --> 30:26.417
It would need to be chronicled.
Why?

30:26.451 --> 30:30.254
For posterity's sake.

30:30.355 --> 30:32.790
Ah.

30:32.891 --> 30:35.793
Well, Master Burchard
would enjoy that.

30:35.828 --> 30:39.164
Now, if all goes
according to plan,

30:39.232 --> 30:41.867
that chronicle would,
I believe,

30:41.901 --> 30:45.504
ensure the loyalty
of the entire Consistory.

30:49.810 --> 30:52.412
If this succeeds, we would
grant you a cardinal's hat.

30:53.814 --> 30:56.450
Now leave us,
if you please.

30:56.551 --> 30:58.886
Our daughter's
ordeal approaches.

31:06.160 --> 31:09.463
Do I look pleasing?

31:09.531 --> 31:13.334
You look beautiful.

31:13.368 --> 31:16.537
Beautiful enough to
satisfy a King of Naples?

31:16.605 --> 31:20.341
One night,
and it will be done.

31:20.375 --> 31:22.276
It will soon
be behind you.

31:22.344 --> 31:26.013
The act may be done
in a night

31:26.081 --> 31:28.282
but I will have blood
for this.

31:47.001 --> 31:49.002
It is time.

32:57.103 --> 32:58.303
Dear God.
God's sake.

32:58.404 --> 33:00.405
My eyes.

33:00.506 --> 33:01.672
Remember.

33:10.048 --> 33:12.149
<i>Oh! Beautiful!</i>

34:06.071 --> 34:07.871
Hey, hey.
Here with me.

34:09.440 --> 34:11.341
Here with me.

34:12.976 --> 34:15.610
Just me...

34:15.713 --> 34:17.713
Just me.

34:23.620 --> 34:26.089
Just me.

36:09.623 --> 36:11.023
Excellent.

36:23.770 --> 36:25.530
Your sister's a lucky woman
to have a husband

36:25.538 --> 36:29.274
that can bring her to ecstasy
on his very first time.

36:29.309 --> 36:32.310
I didn't know the boy
had it in him.

36:32.378 --> 36:34.212
Now, you may
tell your father

36:34.280 --> 36:37.448
the matter has been dealt
with to my satisfaction.

36:41.487 --> 36:43.955
And you may get out
of my house.

37:01.307 --> 37:11.316
[♪]

37:20.193 --> 37:22.294
Father, a man
has come for you.

37:24.331 --> 37:25.765
Oh.

37:25.833 --> 37:28.602
I have been expecting him.

37:28.703 --> 37:34.475
Tell him he will find me
at the old Roman baths at dusk.

37:37.346 --> 37:41.515
Any French princess
of your choosing?

37:41.583 --> 37:45.486
I believe that was the
ambassador's suggestion.

37:45.520 --> 37:48.789
The French King must truly
desire to be rid of his wife.

37:52.960 --> 37:54.161
Look at me.

37:57.532 --> 38:00.167
What happened before.

38:00.234 --> 38:03.437
What all but happened
again last night.

38:03.471 --> 38:05.973
It belongs in the past.

38:06.074 --> 38:10.979
It has no place in
your future, nor in mine.

38:11.046 --> 38:12.147
All is done now.

38:12.181 --> 38:13.815
You can go off
and love your husband,

38:13.883 --> 38:16.051
and I can go off
and find myself a bride.

38:18.588 --> 38:22.691
Maybe we both can work
our way to happiness.

38:30.900 --> 38:32.901
Come back soon.

38:51.989 --> 38:53.723
Listen now.

38:53.791 --> 38:56.627
There will be a dinner
tonight here in the Vatican.

38:56.728 --> 38:59.163
All the cardinals
are to be invited.

38:59.197 --> 39:00.898
You will not attend.

39:00.999 --> 39:01.999
Why not?

39:02.066 --> 39:04.201
Because your sister
tells you so.

39:04.269 --> 39:06.437
Become ill, stay at home.

39:06.471 --> 39:08.639
Don't come to the Vatican.

39:20.651 --> 39:22.453
Francesco Gonzaga,
the Duke of Mantua,

39:22.520 --> 39:24.755
requests an audience.

39:24.823 --> 39:27.458
Has he brought
the duchessa with him?

39:32.665 --> 39:35.667
Oh well.
Fit him in.

39:39.939 --> 39:42.307
So, all set for France?

39:42.374 --> 39:44.308
Now, before you give
Louis his annulment,

39:44.376 --> 39:48.112
look to our advantage.

39:48.213 --> 39:51.015
Get him to renounce his claim
on Naples and beyond that,

39:51.116 --> 39:53.283
whatever else you can to
strengthen our position.

39:54.219 --> 39:55.752
I understand.

39:55.820 --> 39:59.422
You hold the fate of Rome
in your hands.

40:03.996 --> 40:05.129
Go on.

40:06.498 --> 40:12.403
[♪]

40:12.471 --> 40:14.105
Rider!

40:25.017 --> 40:26.951
So...

40:27.019 --> 40:28.753
You have found me.

40:30.188 --> 40:32.557
Yes.

40:32.591 --> 40:34.125
I have found you.

40:34.193 --> 40:35.760
Now I would find the money
you have stolen

40:35.828 --> 40:37.395
from His Holiness.

40:37.429 --> 40:41.499
How could I steal that
which was already stolen?

40:44.303 --> 40:48.772
From good men and bad,
from rich and poor,

40:48.840 --> 40:52.042
the pope steals from
all Italy, regardless.

40:52.076 --> 40:54.945
I have merely redistributed.

40:55.046 --> 40:58.014
Where is it?
Gone.

40:58.049 --> 41:00.417
Where?
Gone.

41:00.452 --> 41:02.686
All gone.

41:04.590 --> 41:09.661
I have wiped him
clean away.

41:14.500 --> 41:18.336
Did I hurt his Holiness?

41:18.438 --> 41:20.872
Where it hurts most?

41:20.973 --> 41:23.041
In his pocket?

41:29.548 --> 41:32.116
You wish to know the truth?
Yes.

41:36.221 --> 41:38.255
He laughed.

41:52.971 --> 41:55.073
Be seated.

41:55.140 --> 41:58.443
Eminencies, Sisters.

41:58.510 --> 42:00.712
Now, the Holy Father
calls upon us all

42:00.780 --> 42:02.314
to give what we can

42:02.348 --> 42:04.816
to support
his endeavours.

42:04.884 --> 42:06.718
Sister,
please stand up.

42:08.154 --> 42:09.621
Your name,
please.

42:09.655 --> 42:11.589
Sister Angela,
my lady.

42:11.624 --> 42:13.724
Step to the front now.

42:13.792 --> 42:16.327
Don't be shy.
Come on.

42:21.167 --> 42:24.736
May I ask you to begin?

42:24.803 --> 42:27.005
But -
my lady -

42:27.073 --> 42:29.141
we have sworn
a vow of poverty.

42:29.175 --> 42:31.076
I have nothing to give.

42:31.177 --> 42:34.180
All I own is
the clothes I wear.

42:34.248 --> 42:36.983
Then, they will
have to do.

42:37.017 --> 42:40.086
Who will give ten
ducats to the Crusade

42:40.154 --> 42:43.289
for Sister Angela's veil?

42:45.560 --> 42:47.427
Cardinals,
this is your night.

42:47.462 --> 42:49.362
Do not be shy.

42:49.463 --> 42:51.197
I know you have gold.

42:51.265 --> 42:53.833
Sister Angela only
has her clothes.

42:53.901 --> 42:57.637
Now let's exchange
the one for the other.

42:57.705 --> 42:59.606
Ten ducats!

42:59.640 --> 43:01.207
<i>Cardinal Grimani!</i>

43:01.275 --> 43:04.910
Please, Sister Angela,
show us what you have.

43:06.480 --> 43:08.280
There we go.

43:09.416 --> 43:11.651
Look at that.

43:11.718 --> 43:14.287
Sister Angela, oh!

43:14.388 --> 43:19.825
Eminencies, how much
for Sister Angela's habit?

43:19.926 --> 43:21.660
Fifty ducats!
Fifty ducats.

43:21.728 --> 43:23.295
Anyone?
Sixty!

43:23.329 --> 43:25.464
<i>- Sixty ducats!</i>
<i>- Eighty ducats!</i>

43:25.498 --> 43:27.199
<i>Item.</i>

43:27.234 --> 43:28.667
<i>Twenty-one nuns' habits,</i>

43:28.735 --> 43:31.904
<i>from the Carmelite</i>
<i>convent in Trastevere.</i>

43:31.938 --> 43:33.439
<i>Item.</i>

43:33.473 --> 43:35.908
<i>Twenty -</i>
<i>one decent prostitutes</i>

43:35.942 --> 43:38.844
<i>from the best</i>
<i>Roman establishments.</i>

43:38.912 --> 43:41.848
<i>And as chronicler to</i>
<i>our beloved Vatican,</i>

43:41.949 --> 43:44.484
<i>it is my sad duty to report</i>

43:44.586 --> 43:49.590
<i>that the said habits did not</i>
<i>remain on the comely maidens</i>

43:49.658 --> 43:52.660
<i>long beyond the first course.</i>

43:52.761 --> 43:54.763
<i>Mm. Sister Angela.</i>

43:54.797 --> 43:56.732
<i>They divested themselves</i>

43:56.766 --> 43:58.133
<i>for gold and silver</i>

43:58.201 --> 43:59.835
<i>of garment after garment</i>

43:59.869 --> 44:02.504
<i>till they were naked as</i>
<i>the day they were born.</i>

44:04.407 --> 44:07.309
<i>They flaunted their nakedness</i>
<i>for the cardinals</i>

44:07.376 --> 44:08.944
<i>with the abandon</i>

44:09.045 --> 44:12.214
<i>for which Roman</i>
<i>prostitutes are renowned.</i>

44:12.282 --> 44:14.416
<i>And as they auctioned</i>
<i>their clothes,</i>

44:14.484 --> 44:16.552
<i>soon they auctioned</i>
<i>their bodies</i>

44:16.586 --> 44:19.855
<i>to the considerable delight</i>
<i>of the cardinals assembled.</i>

44:29.899 --> 44:32.334
Who's there?

44:34.737 --> 44:37.839
<i>Guards!</i>

44:37.874 --> 44:39.941
<i>Guards!</i>

44:43.580 --> 44:45.381
It is a friend,
Your Holiness.

44:47.150 --> 44:49.318
Who means you no harm.

44:49.353 --> 44:51.588
Leave us!

44:54.425 --> 44:56.327
How did you get past
the guards?

44:56.428 --> 44:58.862
They know me
well enough by now.

44:58.897 --> 45:00.130
Ah.

45:02.701 --> 45:05.403
My Lord Gonzaga
had business in Rome.

45:05.437 --> 45:08.506
I know.
He requested an audience.

45:15.580 --> 45:18.615
As do I.

45:26.692 --> 45:28.226
Knowing this pope,

45:28.260 --> 45:30.895
I'd say he's
entering your wife...

45:30.996 --> 45:35.066
just about...now.

45:41.741 --> 45:43.442
Consider the bitch's
insanity

45:43.510 --> 45:46.245
my contribution to
your lady's war on Rome.

45:50.251 --> 45:56.356
- <i>- 200 candied chestnuts.</i>

45:56.457 --> 45:58.959
Dear sisters,

45:58.993 --> 46:01.829
Eminences,
please follow me.

46:01.863 --> 46:04.264
<i>The festivities began at ten</i>

46:04.365 --> 46:06.901
<i>and descended into</i>
<i>debauchery around midnight.</i>

46:10.739 --> 46:11.806
Go at it!

46:13.376 --> 46:15.744
La Farnese distributed
<i>the chestnuts on the floor</i>

46:15.811 --> 46:18.246
<i>and challenged</i>
<i>the valiant damsels</i>

46:18.280 --> 46:22.717
<i>to pick them up using</i>
<i>only their nether regions -</i>

46:22.818 --> 46:27.989
<i>in which enterprise they</i>
<i>showed considerable invention.</i>

46:31.727 --> 46:35.663
<i>Prizes were offered</i>
<i>for those cardinals</i>

46:35.731 --> 46:38.733
<i>most successful with</i>
<i>the prostitutes.</i>

46:46.642 --> 46:53.915
Cardinal Constanzo was
awarded six silken doublets.

46:53.983 --> 46:55.851
Dear Lord.

46:55.919 --> 46:58.654
Who would have thought that
youngster had it in him?

46:58.755 --> 47:02.359
Cardinal Pertucci...
Oh.

47:02.393 --> 47:05.128
...seven pairs of shoes.

47:05.196 --> 47:08.765
Seven?
Enough for a lifetime!

47:08.833 --> 47:10.467
Cardinal Grimani...

47:12.538 --> 47:14.906
...three feathered hats.

47:16.575 --> 47:20.045
Master Burchard, we will spare
you further elucidation.

47:20.112 --> 47:26.117
We will keep this record -
under lock and key -

47:26.218 --> 47:28.552
for posterity.

47:28.587 --> 47:31.389
<i>For history, Your Holiness.</i>

47:31.456 --> 47:32.957
Well, you think
future generations

47:33.024 --> 47:35.025
will be interested in
such shameful antics?

47:35.060 --> 47:36.560
No, no, no, no.

47:36.594 --> 47:39.830
This will be for our own eyes...

47:39.864 --> 47:42.566
alone.

47:57.982 --> 48:04.488
You request from us
a decree of annulment.

48:04.522 --> 48:06.323
You heard me, Holiness.

48:06.391 --> 48:11.495
But annulment can only be
granted with a papal brief -

48:11.529 --> 48:14.498
in the gravest
of circumstances.

48:14.565 --> 48:19.069
The circumstances
are grave - and gross -

48:19.137 --> 48:22.573
and constant.

48:22.607 --> 48:23.975
Infidelity.

48:27.413 --> 48:30.716
With whom?

48:30.783 --> 48:33.686
With His Holiness
the Pope of Rome.

48:46.633 --> 48:48.801
The night before
the battle of Fornovo,

48:48.869 --> 48:52.171
where I spilled my blood
for our Holy Mother Church,

48:52.239 --> 48:54.540
and subsequently.

48:56.443 --> 48:58.611
The very implication
is outrageous.

48:58.645 --> 49:00.245
Indeed it is.

49:00.347 --> 49:02.981
It would scandalize
the whole of Italy.

49:09.788 --> 49:12.690
Where is this wife
of whom you speak?

49:12.725 --> 49:16.094
Your Holiness, I presume,
has no idea?

49:22.667 --> 49:24.635
No idea.

49:24.703 --> 49:29.806
Well, if you happen upon her,

49:29.908 --> 49:33.810
please inform her of my desire.

49:33.878 --> 49:36.280
And of your decision.
