WEBVTT

02:28.520 --> 02:30.600
-Headmistress called me.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.160
Did she tell you what it was about?

02:33.240 --> 02:34.840
Just said it was important.

02:36.880 --> 02:38.240
You seem stressed.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.360
Well, I am stressed.

02:40.440 --> 02:44.080
We will be curtailing
Emma's privileges for the next few weeks,

02:44.160 --> 02:45.800
and we'd like the two of you
to talk with her

02:45.880 --> 02:48.200
so she understands
the gravity of the situation.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.080
We will.

02:51.160 --> 02:52.240
Right?

02:52.320 --> 02:54.040
Yeah, absolutely.

02:54.120 --> 02:55.280
Good.

02:55.360 --> 02:58.160
Er, you can wait for her in the library,
and I'll go and get her.

02:58.240 --> 02:59.400
And, yes...

03:00.520 --> 03:02.760
we want this off school property.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.280
You coming?
You do it.

03:15.360 --> 03:19.120
No, we should do it together.
Our daughter's taking drugs.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.640
She's reacting to our breakup.

03:21.720 --> 03:24.000
-Well, someone had to.

03:24.080 --> 03:26.800
-She's 13, Marcella.
-She blames me, she listens to you.

03:27.880 --> 03:30.760
-And it is your fault.
-If that makes you feel better, then...

03:30.840 --> 03:32.960
-No, it doesn't.

03:33.040 --> 03:34.200
Look, we have to do this together.

03:36.040 --> 03:38.680
And we should've told them
about us together, too.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.080
It's okay.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.240
It's okay.

03:57.360 --> 03:58.400
You all right?

03:59.400 --> 04:01.040
Your dad's gonna stay.
I'll see you soon.

04:14.440 --> 04:16.880
Sorry, guv, he said it was important.

04:16.960 --> 04:19.240
Oh... thank you.

04:21.520 --> 04:23.000
Hi.

04:25.560 --> 04:28.120
-So I've been thinking it over, you see.

04:29.120 --> 04:31.520
That girl, the one I bought stuff off... The one you bought stolen goods from.
Yeah?

04:34.080 --> 04:36.080
Yeah, right. Er, yeah.
Anyway...

04:36.160 --> 04:39.680
A couple of days ago,
this bloke got beaten up behind the shop.

04:39.760 --> 04:41.560
I think she might have been involved.

04:42.320 --> 04:43.400
Why?

04:44.440 --> 04:46.200
Because someone saw
her come out of the shop...

04:46.960 --> 04:49.120
and this kid started talking to her.

04:49.200 --> 04:50.240
All right.

04:50.320 --> 04:53.400
So the officers investigating
that assault have spoken to you?

04:53.480 --> 04:55.600
-Yeah.

04:56.760 --> 04:57.880
That I'd never seen her.

04:57.960 --> 04:59.960
Look, I didn't want to get involved.

05:00.040 --> 05:01.320
But I'm telling you now.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.920
Okay, I'll look into it.
Thanks for coming in.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.960
Er, you know, if this leads anywhere,
if this helps you find her...

05:08.040 --> 05:09.080
Yeah?

05:09.160 --> 05:12.400
You think you could drop the charge,
the receiving thing?

05:12.480 --> 05:13.720
What do you think?

05:14.760 --> 05:15.840
Probably not.

05:15.920 --> 05:17.160
Probably not.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.840
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

05:23.920 --> 05:26.200
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

05:26.280 --> 05:29.800
<i>♪ Happy birthday dear Lea ♪</i>

05:30.800 --> 05:33.160
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

05:33.920 --> 05:36.000
-Happy birthday, bestie.
-Thank you.

05:36.960 --> 05:38.960
Aren't you supposed to get
breakfast in bed on your birthday?

05:39.040 --> 05:40.960
We would have done,
if you hadn't woken up so early.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.600
-It's gone 11:00.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.040
-No.

05:58.120 --> 05:59.840
-Cross my heart.

06:01.240 --> 06:04.040
I bought it with the money
that I got from the stuff.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.640
You're cool with that, right?

06:09.000 --> 06:10.440
-Yeah, I'm cool.

06:13.960 --> 06:15.320
Thank you.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.440
I thought you were gonna
wait at the school.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.560
Why would I do that?

06:27.640 --> 06:29.120
Well, to find out what Emma said.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.040
It was her first time,
she wanted to try it.

06:31.120 --> 06:32.640
And she feels stupid
and she'll never do it again.

06:35.640 --> 06:37.200
What difference will it make?

06:37.280 --> 06:39.440
You've talked to her,
we'll talk again when she comes home.

06:39.520 --> 06:40.760
And the school's on it.

06:41.760 --> 06:43.400
One more thing, erm...

06:48.080 --> 06:50.840
-You're gonna find out sooner or later.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.480
Grace and I are in a relationship.

07:02.280 --> 07:03.320
Grace?

07:04.320 --> 07:05.960
Gibson. At work.

07:07.720 --> 07:09.880
No one knows about us, so I can't...

07:11.200 --> 07:12.520
I walk around...

07:14.240 --> 07:17.320
being politely concerned, when,
really, what I want...

07:18.640 --> 07:20.600
-I'm sorry, I shouldn't... not with you.
-It's all right.

07:23.120 --> 07:24.240
It's okay.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.640
I'm sorry.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.320
It's okay.

08:35.680 --> 08:36.920
I'll see you soon.

08:38.120 --> 08:39.160
Sure.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.760
You're late.
Where you been?

09:08.840 --> 09:12.680
Erm, I had to go to my daughter's school.
Emma's been smoking weed.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.560
What, you want me to lie about it?

09:15.640 --> 09:16.680
Well, keep your jacket on.

09:16.760 --> 09:18.520
You and Alex are gonna go
and see Evan Jones.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.320
-He was robbed and assaulted

09:20.400 --> 09:22.440
behind the pawnshop
where we found those trophies.

09:23.240 --> 09:24.560
Mmm-hmm.

09:38.280 --> 09:39.640
Yeah, that's her.

09:39.720 --> 09:40.840
Are you certain?
-Yeah.

09:40.920 --> 09:42.480
Do you know who she is?

09:43.560 --> 09:44.760
Never seen her before?

09:44.840 --> 09:45.960
Never, no.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.880
Well, but it says here that
she followed you into the backyard.

09:49.960 --> 09:52.160
Yeah, and then she yelled at me to stop.

09:52.240 --> 09:53.840
And when I turned around,
she knocked me down.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.680
Then she stole my phone and wallet.

09:55.760 --> 09:58.680
Right. How far away was she when she...
when she yelled?

09:58.760 --> 10:01.000
Right behind me.
A yard or two, maybe.

10:01.080 --> 10:02.560
So it happened quickly.

10:02.640 --> 10:04.720
Yeah, I didn't have time to react.

10:04.800 --> 10:05.840
Only you did have enough time

10:05.920 --> 10:08.520
to make an absolutely positive
identification of that drawing.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.600
Evan?

10:16.680 --> 10:18.160
Oh, erm...

10:18.240 --> 10:20.880
I'd seen her before,
but I don't know her name

10:20.960 --> 10:23.120
-and I don't know who she is.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.480
The...

10:29.640 --> 10:30.960
The Net.

10:32.800 --> 10:33.840
Come on.

10:34.840 --> 10:37.400
So... that's her.

10:37.480 --> 10:40.680
But she's not online now because
she's got a red marker by her name.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.360
How's it work?

10:44.760 --> 10:48.080
You log in, and...
you click on someone online

10:48.160 --> 10:51.920
and you ask
them to do things.

10:59.480 --> 11:00.840
Mmm, yeah.

11:04.800 --> 11:06.240
Thanks for your help.

11:38.720 --> 11:39.880
ID?

11:42.160 --> 11:43.240
Hey!

12:37.280 --> 12:39.400
Grace Gibson has been found dead. There's evidence to indicate
it's our murderer.

12:42.320 --> 12:44.280
Rav, get someone out to the scene.

12:44.360 --> 12:46.000
Steve, John, get on it straightaway.

12:46.080 --> 12:49.040
Make sure they send out everything
they've got on her disappearance.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.280
We're treating her as our fourth victim.

12:52.520 --> 12:53.560
Marcella?

13:19.240 --> 13:20.560
What?

13:22.440 --> 13:25.440
Tim said the victim was
having an affair with your husband.

13:29.120 --> 13:30.240
Yeah.

13:31.720 --> 13:33.800
How long have you known?

13:33.880 --> 13:35.720
I found out the day before yesterday.

13:36.880 --> 13:38.480
-Tim.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.560
He had a talk with Jason, and...

13:42.560 --> 13:45.280
I didn't know anything about it
until then.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.880
-You're gonna have to take me off it.
-I should.

13:55.520 --> 13:58.320
You are not allowed near the victim's home
or place of work,

13:58.400 --> 14:00.240
and you are not to question Jason.

14:01.480 --> 14:03.160
All right?

14:03.240 --> 14:04.360
Okay.

14:07.120 --> 14:08.400
Are you, erm...

14:08.480 --> 14:10.000
Are you gonna get in shit for this?

14:10.080 --> 14:12.800
Maybe. So make it worth
taking some shit for.

14:20.440 --> 14:24.240
<i>Their planning chief,</i>
<i>Andrew Barnes, has been in touch.</i>

14:24.320 --> 14:28.200
He wants to see detailed plans for Lambeth
and visit the construction site.

14:28.280 --> 14:30.920
I'm stalling, but we ought to have
a strategy in place.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.320
All right.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.120
They found a body on Hampstead Heath.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.160
Grace?

14:42.240 --> 14:44.880
They haven't said.
A woman, that's all.

14:44.960 --> 14:47.000
-It's not Grace.
-I'm just saying that--

14:47.080 --> 14:48.240
It's not Grace!

14:49.320 --> 14:52.040
If you don't actually know,
why bother saying anything?

14:54.080 --> 14:55.840
-Sylvie...

15:09.520 --> 15:10.880
I'm very sorry.

15:24.680 --> 15:26.520
Congratulations, you're a free man.

15:26.600 --> 15:29.000
Here's your paperwork
and a letter of recommendation.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.320
Thank you.

15:31.840 --> 15:33.280
So what are you going to do now?

15:33.360 --> 15:34.760
Gee, I'm not really sure.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.960
I think, er, I might see
a bit more of Maddy.

15:38.040 --> 15:40.480
-Yeah, she seems nice.
-Oh, she is.

15:40.560 --> 15:42.160
She's fantastic.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.280
All right, thanks...

15:45.000 --> 15:46.960
-Good luck.

15:47.040 --> 15:49.120
-Yeah.
-Pop by some time.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.240
I will.

16:11.480 --> 16:12.680
-Maybe we'll see you in there.
Yeah...

16:12.760 --> 16:14.200
Maddy!

16:15.520 --> 16:16.760
Peter.

16:16.840 --> 16:19.160
Where's Guy?

16:19.240 --> 16:22.960
He's gone. I'm free.
Released this morning.

16:24.120 --> 16:26.960
-Come on, let's go and grab a coffee.

16:27.040 --> 16:29.440
Er, yeah.
Only... I can't.

16:29.520 --> 16:31.480
I've only got ten minutes
to my next lecture.

16:32.880 --> 16:34.840
Another time, though.

16:34.920 --> 16:37.280
We ought to decide when
a bit beforehand.

16:37.360 --> 16:39.280
-Just to make sure I can.
-Yeah, yeah.

16:39.360 --> 16:41.360
No, of course, of course.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.400
Let's make it soon, yeah?

16:43.480 --> 16:44.720
Yeah.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.640
I'm really looking forward to it.

16:46.720 --> 16:48.640
Me, too.
All right, I'll see you soon.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.920
-Yeah, yeah.
-Okay.

17:05.680 --> 17:10.320
Tape, bag, cable ties, everything is
identical to the other victims.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.760
Only, he moves this one.

17:11.840 --> 17:13.760
-He didn't want her found straightaway.

17:13.840 --> 17:16.720
No, he wasn't bothered
about when they were found before.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.280
You see,
Fincher was lying there for weeks. He could have been disturbed by something.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.800
Could be.
How we doin' on CCTV?

17:21.880 --> 17:24.080
There's nothing by her house,
according to DI Williamson.

17:24.160 --> 17:25.680
Erm, the next closest is a side street.

17:25.760 --> 17:27.320
Well, check it out.
'Cause I'm sure he had a car.

17:27.400 --> 17:29.520
-I can do that.
-It's usually DC's doing that.

17:29.600 --> 17:32.160
Well, yeah, I know, but I don't mind.
I've got to learn.

17:33.360 --> 17:35.880
Did, erm, they find any kind of trophy?

17:35.960 --> 17:38.560
We don't know yet.
The family are looking into it.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.920
But there was something else.
Alex?

17:42.000 --> 17:44.920
Yeah, we found blood on the kitchen table.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.480
So, if we're lucky,
Grace put up a fight and it's his.

17:47.560 --> 17:50.440
We need samples from the family
and we need to find her boyfriend,

17:50.520 --> 17:52.840
'cause there are traces of a man
in the bedroom and bathroom,

17:52.920 --> 17:55.040
although she's listed as
the sole occupant.

18:02.200 --> 18:03.520
She was having a...

18:05.320 --> 18:07.200
a relationship with my husband.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.280
Are you serious?

18:10.360 --> 18:13.280
I didn't know until after
Grace went missing.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.120
Laura's been informed and she's...

18:15.200 --> 18:18.240
okay with me continuing work
on the investigation.

18:19.600 --> 18:20.680
Did you know about this?

18:20.760 --> 18:22.080
Mmm-hmm.

18:22.720 --> 18:23.800
This is completely crazy.

18:23.880 --> 18:25.920
I know, Alex, it's not up to me.

18:27.120 --> 18:29.520
You got a problem with it?
Go talk to Laura.

18:32.080 --> 18:34.160
You know, she's DCI Porter
to the rest of us.

18:40.880 --> 18:42.920
The webcam girl from the pawnshop.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.240
Anyway, I contacted admin at the sex site.

18:45.320 --> 18:47.480
Anyway, lot of hemming and hawing,
to-ing and fro-ing,

18:47.560 --> 18:48.960
but they gave me an account number.

18:49.040 --> 18:51.840
-Just got off the phone with the bank--
-Short version, Mark.

18:51.920 --> 18:53.320
I found her.

18:53.400 --> 18:54.600
What?

18:56.880 --> 18:59.480
Great. Marcella, get Alex
and get on to it straightaway.

18:59.560 --> 19:01.880
-If we're right, she's seen the killer.
-Okay.

19:16.600 --> 19:19.400
I don't know where she is.
Why are you looking for her?

19:19.480 --> 19:20.800
She didn't say
where she was going?

19:20.880 --> 19:22.320
I went out and she wasn't here
when I got back.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.480
Look, I'm not interested in her stealing.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.720
I want to know who she stole from.

19:28.440 --> 19:29.960
He could be dangerous.
Do you get that?

19:31.560 --> 19:32.800
Get her to call me.

19:33.880 --> 19:35.160
We'll see ourselves out.

19:53.160 --> 19:55.360
Cara, it's me.
Where are you?

19:55.440 --> 19:57.200
The police are here looking for you.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.920
Yeah, they want to know
who you'd nicked stuff from.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.760
-They said that they--

20:02.520 --> 20:04.200
I said, where is she?

20:28.840 --> 20:29.880
There.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.440
Okay. Thanks.

20:36.920 --> 20:38.480
Shit! Sorry.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.320
Have you seen this girl?
I said, have you seen this...

21:07.960 --> 21:09.000
Over there?

21:15.720 --> 21:17.240
Cara!

21:31.920 --> 21:33.040
Oh...

22:08.600 --> 22:10.480
She met up with people on Sinnr.

22:11.560 --> 22:13.000
What is that?

22:13.080 --> 22:15.880
It's an app for people who wanna
cheat on their partners.

22:17.480 --> 22:20.240
She'd sleep with them and then nick
all their stuff before they woke up.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.200
Counting on the fact that they
wouldn't go to the police.

22:23.280 --> 22:25.360
Because they'd been unfaithful.
-Yeah.

22:26.200 --> 22:27.520
Clever.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.120
So our man's on Sinnr.

22:31.200 --> 22:33.640
That's how she got the trophies.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.200
Can you think of anything else?

22:36.320 --> 22:38.960
-She did webcams.
All right.

22:41.920 --> 22:43.520
One of her punters threatened her.

22:44.520 --> 22:45.760
Did she know them?

22:46.800 --> 22:49.240
No, but she was completely freaked out.

22:51.720 --> 22:54.240
He said he'd find her
and he was gonna kill her.

22:58.640 --> 23:01.040
I told her there was
no way he could find her.

23:04.680 --> 23:06.200
She felt safe, I guess, at the...

23:09.080 --> 23:10.440
Oh, okay...

23:10.520 --> 23:11.680
I know.

23:13.280 --> 23:17.040
We're gonna find him. Okay?

23:19.120 --> 23:21.200
You think
he's murdered three people.

23:21.280 --> 23:25.320
You know he beat his wife to death.
And now he's a free man.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.560
-Look, he fits the profile I'm building.

23:27.640 --> 23:30.840
It's gonna mean more to my career
than my dissertation if I'm right.

23:30.920 --> 23:33.120
You are completely out of your mind.

23:33.200 --> 23:34.560
-So you don't like it.
-No!

23:34.640 --> 23:36.520
I don't like you flirting
with your clients!

23:36.600 --> 23:39.040
There's no comparison, Maddy.
Come on!

23:39.720 --> 23:42.280
Don't look at that, listen to me.
I won't have you seeing him, all right?

23:42.360 --> 23:45.600
-I can't deal with this right now.

24:28.480 --> 24:30.560
You finishing soon so we can
finally head home?

24:30.640 --> 24:32.600
Yeah, just a minute.
Just a minute.

24:38.720 --> 24:39.720
Here.

24:46.560 --> 24:48.400
That's too little.

24:48.480 --> 24:50.480
-Uh-huh.

24:50.560 --> 24:51.800
It's not what we agreed.

24:52.800 --> 24:54.240
You shouldn't even be in the country.

24:54.320 --> 24:57.080
You should be glad I pay you at all,
you fucking parasite.

25:05.440 --> 25:06.560
Bounty!

25:08.440 --> 25:10.880
-Come on. Come on.

25:12.760 --> 25:14.840
So, I called Patrick.

25:14.920 --> 25:17.040
And, er, I can get my old job back.

25:17.120 --> 25:18.280
That's in Norwich, though.

25:18.920 --> 25:21.120
-Yeah, I know.
-We don't live in Norwich.

25:21.200 --> 25:23.720
No, but we could.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.400
They got computers that need
fixing there as well.

25:27.480 --> 25:28.920
What do you want me to say?

25:30.160 --> 25:33.120
How about...
"We're good here, too, Yann.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.640
-This is just a bump in the road."

25:35.720 --> 25:38.440
Or, "I love you, Yann."

25:38.520 --> 25:39.760
Try that.

25:40.880 --> 25:42.040
Okay.

25:43.440 --> 25:46.200
Things are slow at work, all right?

25:48.680 --> 25:52.000
And that's why you're
consulting at Gibson's.

25:52.080 --> 25:53.080
Fuck.

25:53.160 --> 25:56.040
So Henry knows about our
financial situation, but not me.

25:56.120 --> 25:58.120
-He's what bothers you with this.
-Yeah.

25:58.200 --> 26:00.600
-You're totally dependent on him.
-No, I'm not.

26:00.680 --> 26:02.680
Okay, you keep telling yourself that.

26:02.760 --> 26:04.800
Jesus.

26:04.880 --> 26:07.720
Hey... your boyfriend's here.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.000
Oh, that's really mature, Yann.

26:15.360 --> 26:16.400
Henry?

26:21.600 --> 26:23.400
They found Grace.

27:28.040 --> 27:29.040
I, erm...

27:30.040 --> 27:31.840
heard about that webcam girl.

27:31.920 --> 27:33.040
Brutal.

27:33.120 --> 27:34.680
Yep.

27:34.760 --> 27:37.280
The, erm, jewellery from the pawnshop...

27:37.360 --> 27:38.720
Yeah?

27:38.800 --> 27:41.040
There was definitely nothing
of Grace Gibson's.

27:41.120 --> 27:42.280
No.

27:42.360 --> 27:45.280
Webcam girl, she must've slept with him
before he murdered Gibson.

27:45.360 --> 27:46.760
Yeah, I suppose.

27:48.040 --> 27:49.280
Thanks.

27:51.680 --> 27:53.280
Her name was Cara.

28:11.240 --> 28:13.800
-The interview with Jason.

28:13.880 --> 28:15.320
Oh, I'm supposed to keep
my distance from him.

28:15.400 --> 28:17.560
-I'm part of the investigation.
-I know.

28:22.320 --> 28:23.840
Why the question mark?

28:27.040 --> 28:28.720
That's a different MO.

28:28.800 --> 28:31.240
-Maybe.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.600
So, how's the rest of it going?

28:34.880 --> 28:37.520
-We lost a witness today.
-Yeah. Yeah, I heard.

28:37.600 --> 28:39.160
Where was, er, Cullen at the time?

28:39.240 --> 28:41.200
No idea.
I'm not allowed anywhere near him.

28:42.240 --> 28:44.320
What, and you're doing what they tell you?

28:44.400 --> 28:46.600
Laura will chuck me
off the case otherwise.

28:47.640 --> 28:49.800
I've not managed
to keep all my friends.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.480
Are you staying?

28:53.480 --> 28:55.320
-For a bit, sure.
-Good.

28:55.920 --> 28:57.240
-Go on in.

29:23.840 --> 29:25.600
There you are.
Good.

29:27.760 --> 29:28.840
How are you?

29:32.360 --> 29:34.800
We identified Grace last night.

29:35.880 --> 29:36.880
I know.

29:37.960 --> 29:39.520
Must be very hard for you.

29:43.400 --> 29:47.160
They had a police specialist there
who took DNA samples.

29:47.240 --> 29:49.040
In order to rule us out.

29:52.600 --> 29:55.560
He was asking how he could
get hold of Henry...

30:00.040 --> 30:01.400
and her boyfriend.

30:04.400 --> 30:07.280
Sylvie, I can explain...

30:07.360 --> 30:09.200
No, really, don't even try.

30:10.880 --> 30:12.320
We're done here.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.720
I've got a case review
in 15 minutes, so...

30:48.800 --> 30:49.800
Right, then.
Mark?

30:49.880 --> 30:51.120
Cara's mobile was crushed.

30:51.200 --> 30:53.640
Without her log-in details,
we aren't gonna be able to get anything.

30:53.720 --> 30:55.320
We don't even know which email address
she was using.

30:55.400 --> 30:56.400
What about her computer?

30:56.480 --> 30:58.080
Well, we're working
on restoring her chats, see if we can track down
the person who threatened her.

30:59.840 --> 31:00.840
Good.

31:00.920 --> 31:02.000
We've been checking on black Ford Fiestas,

31:02.080 --> 31:03.720
none have been registered
as stolen so far.

31:03.800 --> 31:05.880
And there's no CCTV
at the end of that tunnel.

31:05.960 --> 31:07.040
He moved Grace Gibson.

31:07.120 --> 31:09.280
Even if he changes it,
he uses some sort of vehicle.

31:09.360 --> 31:10.360
Yeah.

31:10.440 --> 31:11.640
Go back and see
if we've overlooked

31:11.720 --> 31:13.000
anything in the witness statements
about that.

31:13.080 --> 31:14.520
Sure.
Alex, Marcella, you do it.

31:14.600 --> 31:17.040
We've also got the post-mortem
from Gibson.

31:17.120 --> 31:19.120
Single blow to the head,
same cause of death as the others,

31:19.200 --> 31:21.240
except she had cocaine in her bloodstream,

31:21.320 --> 31:23.480
scratch marks on her throat
and bruising on one forearm

31:23.560 --> 31:25.080
as if someone had grabbed her.

31:25.160 --> 31:27.720
And she might have put up a fight,
we found blood.

31:27.800 --> 31:29.760
She was also
six to seven weeks pregnant.

31:29.840 --> 31:30.840
What?

31:36.200 --> 31:37.480
I'm sorry.

31:41.760 --> 31:43.160
I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking.

31:45.560 --> 31:46.560
It's fine.

31:51.080 --> 31:52.120
I'm sorry.

31:54.720 --> 31:56.920
I'm gonna decide the places.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.720
Just cafes, things like that.
Among people.

32:03.720 --> 32:05.200
Never get in the car with him.

32:05.280 --> 32:06.960
Never go to his home.

32:07.040 --> 32:08.840
Never be alone with him. -He is dangerous.
-I know.

32:12.640 --> 32:16.600
But I need to build a profile,
and to do that I need to meet him.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.560
I'm just looking out for you.

32:25.040 --> 32:28.560
I will be careful.
I promise.

32:31.680 --> 32:32.840
I love you.

32:53.880 --> 32:55.920
Nothing about a black Ford Fiesta
anywhere.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.360
What do you have?

32:57.440 --> 32:58.440
Erm...

32:58.520 --> 33:01.440
Two people saw a delivery van or lorry

33:01.520 --> 33:04.080
with a logo on the side
outside Benjamin Williams' flat.

33:04.160 --> 33:05.200
A delivery van.

33:05.280 --> 33:07.560
That would explain how he knows
his way around their homes.

33:09.840 --> 33:10.840
Oh, yeah.
Sorry, I forgot.

33:10.920 --> 33:14.080
Peter Cullen doesn't drive a delivery van,
so it's probably not important.

33:14.160 --> 33:15.520
-I didn't say that.
-You didn't have to.

33:15.600 --> 33:16.720
You don't know him.

33:17.400 --> 33:18.560
No, but I'm starting to know you.

33:18.640 --> 33:19.880
What's that supposed to mean?

33:20.360 --> 33:21.520
Just that.

33:25.640 --> 33:28.200
Social worker said a minicab
took her parking spot

33:28.280 --> 33:30.040
around the time Williams was killed.

33:31.880 --> 33:34.320
Yeah. A minicab was also spotted
outside Liz Harper's.

33:34.400 --> 33:35.840
Not parked, but it passed by twice.

33:35.920 --> 33:39.160
Although the witness wasn't sure
it was the same car both times.

33:39.240 --> 33:40.600
Great.

33:40.680 --> 33:42.920
So, we've got a delivery van
and a minicab.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
I'll tell Rav.

33:44.080 --> 33:45.520
You're not gonna help?

33:46.480 --> 33:47.480
You know me.

33:52.440 --> 33:55.200
You didn't know we issued
those appeals to hospitals, did you?

33:55.880 --> 33:59.040
You were stabbed with scissors
while breaking and entering.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.840
We've got blood from the crime scene.

34:04.440 --> 34:06.560
You know it's better for you
to talk to us about it,

34:06.640 --> 34:10.360
otherwise we'll be looking
at including four murders as well.

34:10.440 --> 34:11.920
Was Peter Cullen there?

34:12.960 --> 34:15.160
Was he with you?
Was he waiting outside?

34:19.000 --> 34:20.720
He wasn't even there, was he?

34:33.760 --> 34:36.960
He was leaving Cullen unsupervised,
and he was his only alibi.

34:37.920 --> 34:39.680
Can I go somewhere near him now?

35:00.160 --> 35:01.720
DS Backland, I'm here to see Peter Cullen.

35:02.760 --> 35:04.360
-Yep.

35:05.520 --> 35:06.840
Released yesterday.

35:12.440 --> 35:13.920
He's out on parole as of yesterday.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.440
He's got a place in a halfway house
and he's yet to be seen.

35:16.520 --> 35:18.320
How the hell did we miss this?

35:25.280 --> 35:26.920
-Come on!

35:36.800 --> 35:38.200
Maddy!

35:38.280 --> 35:40.200
Cullen's out.

35:40.280 --> 35:42.480
-Yeah.

35:43.480 --> 35:45.040
Why, have you seen him?

35:45.120 --> 35:46.840
Yeah, he turned up
at my college yesterday.

35:46.920 --> 35:48.520
If he contacts you again, you call me.

35:49.520 --> 35:51.320
I know what I'm doing.
I'm being careful.

35:51.400 --> 35:53.560
He's dangerous.
-I know he is.

35:53.640 --> 35:56.040
If he shows up, don't lie,
don't reject him,

35:56.120 --> 35:58.040
don't do anything
that he'll see as a betrayal,

35:58.120 --> 35:59.480
you just get away from him.

35:59.560 --> 36:01.160
But I need him for my studies.

36:01.240 --> 36:02.640
He is sick.

36:03.960 --> 36:05.880
You do know that, don't you?

36:08.920 --> 36:10.320
You call me.

36:13.120 --> 36:14.360
Yeah, I'll call.

36:29.720 --> 36:30.760
Adrian?

36:35.000 --> 36:36.480
Adrian, are you home?

36:57.040 --> 36:58.560
That's one less problem.

37:00.960 --> 37:02.000
So...

37:04.160 --> 37:05.920
tell me about Maddy.

37:08.040 --> 37:09.400
What does she like?

37:10.760 --> 37:11.840
Hmm?

37:17.440 --> 37:18.560
Okay.

37:30.120 --> 37:31.200
Stuart?

38:02.720 --> 38:04.120
You made me jump, Bendek.

38:04.200 --> 38:05.960
-Sorry. Sorry.

38:06.040 --> 38:07.360
I didn't mean to.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.640
-The rent.
-Oh, thank you.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.280
Where is Stuart?

38:15.880 --> 38:17.680
He'll be home soon, I'm sure.

38:17.760 --> 38:19.240
I'm...

38:19.320 --> 38:21.160
I'm going to get something to eat.

38:21.960 --> 38:23.680
Do you want company?

38:26.840 --> 38:28.240
Sure, why not?

39:04.840 --> 39:05.840
Bounty

39:20.840 --> 39:22.040
Bounty, where are you?

39:31.520 --> 39:32.720
Bounty!

39:45.520 --> 39:47.080
Tired?

39:47.160 --> 39:49.040
It's been a long day.

39:51.160 --> 39:52.640
I can do massage.

39:53.840 --> 39:54.880
I'm very good.

39:55.840 --> 39:59.240
My ex-girlfriend said,
"Bendek, you are so good with massage."

40:00.520 --> 40:02.680
That's okay, thanks.

40:20.760 --> 40:23.040
<i>I slept at her place</i>
<i>the night before last.</i>

40:23.120 --> 40:24.480
<i>Not last night?</i>

40:24.560 --> 40:25.880
<i>No.</i>

40:25.960 --> 40:28.440
<i>I saw Marcella</i>
<i>earlier on today.</i>

40:28.520 --> 40:30.760
<i>Got the impression</i>
<i>that you were still married.</i>

40:31.760 --> 40:34.720
<i>We are.</i>
<i>But we've separated.</i>

40:36.440 --> 40:38.040
<i>Sorry to hear that.</i>

40:39.320 --> 40:41.600
<i>How long ago were you separated?</i>

40:41.680 --> 40:43.360
<i>A week or two.</i>

40:43.440 --> 40:45.040
<i>Bit more.</i>

40:47.400 --> 40:50.480
<i>How long have you been</i>
<i>in a relationship with Grace Gibson?</i>

40:54.160 --> 40:56.320
<i>You're not taking any notes.</i>

40:58.880 --> 41:00.240
<i>How long?</i>

41:04.400 --> 41:05.880
<i>Three years.</i>

41:11.080 --> 41:12.440
<i>Three years.</i>

41:14.080 --> 41:15.480
<i>Three years.</i>

41:16.480 --> 41:18.840
<i>Three years.</i>
<i>Three years.</i>

41:20.600 --> 41:21.960
<i>Just over.</i>

41:33.080 --> 41:34.120
Marcella.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.920
What are you doing here?

41:36.000 --> 41:37.640
You don't live here any more.

41:42.680 --> 41:44.240
I got the sack today.

41:53.560 --> 41:55.680
Did you have to ruin everything?

41:58.160 --> 41:59.600
Why couldn't you just go on
sleeping with her? I didn't have to know.

42:01.200 --> 42:02.840
Are you glad she's dead?

42:07.680 --> 42:08.720
No.

42:11.520 --> 42:13.000
I have to see her.

42:16.560 --> 42:18.960
I've got no right to ask.

42:19.040 --> 42:21.040
And you've got every right
to tell me to go to hell,

42:21.120 --> 42:22.720
but I have to see her.

43:23.680 --> 43:25.440
She was pregnant.

43:26.800 --> 43:28.520
When she died.

43:30.520 --> 43:32.320
She was seven weeks pregnant.

43:53.360 --> 43:54.360
Whoa.

43:54.440 --> 43:56.480
What are you still doing here?
Shouldn't you be at home?

43:56.560 --> 43:57.720
Come and have a look at this.

43:58.520 --> 44:01.240
I got hold of the CCTV
from Hampstead Heath.

44:01.320 --> 44:04.320
There's no camera where we found
Gibson's body or on the next street.

44:04.400 --> 44:05.880
Closest one's at a car park.

44:05.960 --> 44:09.720
So I planned to start there,
and kind of work my way outwards.

44:09.800 --> 44:11.680
Anyway, look who I found.

44:23.200 --> 44:25.600
Jesus! That's Clive Bonn.

44:28.440 --> 44:30.360
Good work, Mark.

44:30.440 --> 44:32.120
There's something else.

44:32.200 --> 44:33.760
Marcella.

44:33.840 --> 44:36.400
She's been looking at the CCTV
from Grace Gibson's house.

44:36.480 --> 44:37.680
I know, we told her to.

44:37.760 --> 44:39.720
Yeah, yeah, but before that.

44:39.800 --> 44:41.560
<i>Three days ago.</i>

44:41.640 --> 44:43.240
<i>Before we found Gibson dead.</i>
