01:02.125 --> 01:04.792
I'm gonna be
perfectly candid
with you, Shoshanna.

01:04.792 --> 01:07.750
I don't think
you're the right fit
for McKinsey.

01:07.750 --> 01:10.542
Well, people always think
that I'm not gonna
fit in at first,

01:10.542 --> 01:11.708
but then I always do.

01:11.708 --> 01:13.708
I always fit in,
just very subtly.

01:13.708 --> 01:15.125
Hmm.

01:15.125 --> 01:17.125
I bet you didn't think
that Chelsea Clinton
was gonna fit here,

01:17.125 --> 01:18.250
but she totally did.

01:18.250 --> 01:19.458
She has always been
one of my heroes

01:19.458 --> 01:20.583
because she's
such a strong woman

01:20.583 --> 01:23.208
struggling so nobly
with her very curly hair.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.834
Chelsea Clinton
doesn't work here anymore.

01:27.333 --> 01:28.667
Because of her hair?

01:28.667 --> 01:31.166
I'm sorry, Shoshanna,
I just-- I don't see you here.

01:31.166 --> 01:33.542
Well, maybe you
just don't see me here
because I'm not here yet.

01:33.542 --> 01:36.959
But just give me the chance
for you to see me here
and I will be here.

01:36.959 --> 01:38.500
I will be here.

01:38.500 --> 01:41.291
It was lovely to meet you.

01:51.333 --> 01:53.333
Um, you're not leaving?

01:53.333 --> 01:54.708
That's correct.

01:54.708 --> 01:56.125
I would like to know
what's wrong with me.

01:56.125 --> 01:59.208
- Uh, there's
nothing wrong with you.
- No, no, no, really.

01:59.208 --> 02:01.083
It would help me
for getting my next
job, please.

02:01.083 --> 02:02.583
I would like to know
what's wrong with me,

02:02.583 --> 02:04.333
and I am prepared
for any answer.

02:06.125 --> 02:07.375
Okay.

02:07.375 --> 02:08.834
Okay.

02:08.834 --> 02:11.583
Well, you clearly have
an analytical mind.

02:11.583 --> 02:14.750
I worry that you view things
in too simplistic a manner.

02:14.750 --> 02:17.625
In terms of your
leadership abilities,

02:17.625 --> 02:20.708
I'm concerned that you have
an off-putting style.

02:20.708 --> 02:21.792
Like, visually?

02:21.792 --> 02:23.667
Because I know I tend
towards the fashion forward,

02:23.667 --> 02:25.708
but great leaders need
to be focused on the future.

02:25.708 --> 02:28.792
I'm speaking
in a deeper sense.

02:28.792 --> 02:31.333
Also, in terms
of being a team player,

02:31.333 --> 02:34.041
it's problematic
that you lack a certain
sensitivity.

02:34.041 --> 02:36.166
Okay, well, in my
anecdotal experience,

02:36.166 --> 02:37.834
people really enjoy
hearing the truth.

02:37.834 --> 02:40.625
Like, that necklace
isn't flattering on you.

02:40.625 --> 02:41.917
( chuckles )

02:41.917 --> 02:45.333
Shoshanna, keep in mind
that I'm simply talking

02:45.333 --> 02:47.750
about this particular
working environment.

02:47.750 --> 02:50.417
I'm sure that
your energetic drive

02:50.417 --> 02:52.417
and your unique
personal style

02:52.417 --> 02:55.625
will be greatly rewarded
in another work environment.

02:55.625 --> 02:58.959
Okay, um, well,
if that's it, then--

02:58.959 --> 03:00.333
Oh, no, no, hold on.

03:00.333 --> 03:02.417
We haven't even
gotten to how you answered
the case question yet.

03:02.417 --> 03:06.417
First, you seem
to have no familiarity
with the subject matter.

03:06.417 --> 03:09.917
Marnie:
♪ Cover me, baby,
hold me tonight ♪

03:09.917 --> 03:11.708
♪ The skies
are glowing... ♪

03:11.708 --> 03:13.959
( song continues faintly )

03:13.959 --> 03:16.500
I mean, obviously,
this is just, like,
a rough mix,

03:16.500 --> 03:17.500
so just keep that
in mind.

03:17.500 --> 03:19.208
Oh, so this is how
you guys really sound?

03:19.208 --> 03:20.375
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

03:20.375 --> 03:22.375
I thought it was, like,
badly mixed or something.

03:22.375 --> 03:25.375
- ♪ There isn't
any place to hide... ♪
- Ahem.

03:25.375 --> 03:26.875
You're about to get
to a good part.

03:26.875 --> 03:28.417
- Oh, awesome.
- Yeah.

03:28.417 --> 03:30.542
♪ ...burning

03:30.542 --> 03:32.250
When-- when does it happen?

03:32.250 --> 03:34.542
It was just happening
while you were talking.

03:34.542 --> 03:38.000
I mean, truthfully,
I can't tell what's you

03:38.000 --> 03:40.333
and what's the music
in the bar, you know?

03:40.333 --> 03:41.542
- So it's...
- Oh, okay.

03:41.542 --> 03:43.417
Well, um, I'm the one
in your left ear.

03:43.417 --> 03:45.041
- Oh, keep-- yeah.
- Okay.

03:45.041 --> 03:47.291
Uh, excuse me?
Excuse me?

03:47.291 --> 03:49.166
Yeah, could you
turn down the music?

03:49.166 --> 03:51.041
It's just a little loud
and we're trying to work.

03:51.041 --> 03:53.125
That would be great.
Thank you.

03:54.750 --> 03:58.458
Well, you did it.
You made a song.

03:58.458 --> 04:00.041
Marnie:
Oh, um, thank you.

04:00.041 --> 04:02.333
Is there any other
feedback or anything?

04:02.333 --> 04:05.500
You know, I can't think
of anything right now.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.500
Great.

04:07.500 --> 04:08.875
Oh, my God,
you look amazing.

04:08.875 --> 04:10.792
- How was your interview?
- Terrible.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.834
It was like
my seventh interview
in two weeks.

04:12.834 --> 04:14.375
Seriously,
the system is broken.

04:14.375 --> 04:16.583
Like, they should
just tell you ahead of time

04:16.583 --> 04:17.875
whether or not
you're gonna get the job

04:17.875 --> 04:19.666
so you don't have to waste
all that time and energy

04:19.666 --> 04:22.458
doing your hair and, like,
getting your nails done,

04:22.458 --> 04:25.667
and then you could
just stay home and, like,
look for other work instead.

04:25.667 --> 04:29.542
Shoshanna,
interviews are bullshit.
All interviews.

04:29.542 --> 04:32.708
Even talk show interviews.
Fuck Phil Donahue.

04:32.708 --> 04:34.542
I just don't understand
why nobody tells you

04:34.542 --> 04:36.000
how bad it's gonna be
in the real world.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.417
Yeah, they do.
It's pretty much
all they ever tell you.

04:38.417 --> 04:41.667
I just don't understand,
like, what makes these people
qualified to judge me?

04:41.667 --> 04:43.333
Well, they have the jobs.

04:43.333 --> 04:44.834
That's what makes
them qualified.

04:44.834 --> 04:47.333
Jessa:
You know, if you
want some cash,

04:47.333 --> 04:48.959
you could just
sell an organ.

04:48.959 --> 04:51.667
People will pay
so much fucking money
for an organ.

04:51.667 --> 04:52.917
It's such a racket.

04:52.917 --> 04:54.667
Hey, Shosh, can you listen
to something for me?

04:54.667 --> 04:56.417
I just kinda need
your feedback.

04:56.417 --> 04:58.250
I want it.
I'm ready for it.

04:58.250 --> 05:00.708
( song playing )

05:01.708 --> 05:03.250
Ahem.

05:04.542 --> 05:05.875
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

05:09.875 --> 05:12.041
Yeah, no, I don't need
to hear any more.

05:12.041 --> 05:13.375
It's a perfect song.

05:13.375 --> 05:15.041
It's like one of those
billion-dollar songs

05:15.041 --> 05:16.542
where the first time
you hear it, you hate it...

05:16.542 --> 05:18.250
- Jessa: Yes.
- But then they play it
on the radio

05:18.250 --> 05:19.875
like 800 times
and then you love it.

05:19.875 --> 05:21.792
Yeah, that's exactly it.

05:21.792 --> 05:23.458
- So, you hate it.
- No.

05:23.458 --> 05:26.375
- No, then, like,
eventually you love it.
- Shoshanna: Yeah.

05:26.375 --> 05:28.041
Once they play it
on the radio a billion times

05:28.041 --> 05:30.291
and it's a huge hit,
then I'm gonna love it.

05:30.291 --> 05:31.375
'Cause you're forced to.

05:31.375 --> 05:33.208
It's, like, shoved
into your brain.

05:33.208 --> 05:34.625
You can't get it
out of your head,

05:34.625 --> 05:36.959
and then you're,
like, forced to be like,
"Okay, fine, I love it."

05:36.959 --> 05:39.500
You know what?
You guys have been absolutely
no fuckin' help here.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.542
This is a situation
where I could really
use Hannah

05:41.542 --> 05:43.291
because she is
a creative person

05:43.291 --> 05:45.834
and would be
able to give me
meaningful feedback.

05:45.834 --> 05:48.917
I think my feedback
was, like, pretty spot-on.

06:10.250 --> 06:11.750
Fuck.

06:24.792 --> 06:27.792
( keyboard clicking )

06:38.625 --> 06:41.417
I can't concentrate
while you're doing that.

06:41.417 --> 06:42.750
I'm not doing anything.

06:42.750 --> 06:45.625
Yeah, and it's driving
me crazy.

06:45.625 --> 06:47.917
It's just I had this story
that I wanted to write,

06:47.917 --> 06:50.375
and suddenly
it just seems
so trivial.

06:50.375 --> 06:53.375
The one about you
not buying the Thin Mints
from the Girl Scouts?

06:53.375 --> 06:55.291
It's not trivial.
It's a triumph of will.

06:55.291 --> 06:56.708
Yeah, but then
I bought them.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.500
That's the end.
I bought them.

06:58.500 --> 06:59.834
( phone chimes )

07:01.834 --> 07:04.792
- Hey, my dad's
gonna be here at 6:30.
- Why is he coming?

07:04.792 --> 07:06.208
Oh, he has a conference
in Minneapolis,

07:06.208 --> 07:07.375
so he's just gonna
swing by for dinner.

07:07.375 --> 07:10.333
- You wanna join us?
- Um, no.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.125
What are you working on?

07:15.125 --> 07:18.500
This article
made of pictures

07:18.500 --> 07:22.375
of how fat kids
make for slutty adults.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.875
Did you have anyone
sign releases?

07:24.875 --> 07:27.333
- God, no.
- You could get sued.

07:27.333 --> 07:28.667
We're in Iowa.

07:28.667 --> 07:31.750
They don't know what
a fuckin' release is.

07:31.750 --> 07:34.708
- ( car horns honking )
- No, it's all the fucking
honking outside my street.

07:34.708 --> 07:37.291
They put a new traffic light
on my corner.

07:37.291 --> 07:39.208
Yeah, a few days ago.

07:39.208 --> 07:43.125
Yeah, and inexplicably,
it's green for about
four seconds

07:43.125 --> 07:44.667
and then the red light
is interminable,

07:44.667 --> 07:48.375
so all these cars get gummed up
on my fuckin' block all day.

07:48.375 --> 07:49.667
Yeah, exactly.

07:49.667 --> 07:51.208
And if someone wants
to take a left turn,

07:51.208 --> 07:52.458
it's exponentially worse.

07:52.458 --> 07:54.750
Just unabridged chaos
in seconds.

07:54.750 --> 07:56.291
- ( honking continues )
- Yeah.

07:56.291 --> 07:58.667
- ( man shouting )
- No, that's the thing.

07:58.667 --> 08:00.125
This block used to be
one of the quietest,

08:00.125 --> 08:01.959
most serene blocks
in the whole neighborhood.

08:01.959 --> 08:04.875
And now every morning
it's like the fall of Rome.

08:04.875 --> 08:07.208
( birds chirping )

08:11.917 --> 08:15.041
( keyboard clicking )

08:21.333 --> 08:24.417
( distant chatter )

08:29.667 --> 08:33.082
- ( door closes )
- ( laughter )

08:45.959 --> 08:49.083
( car horns honking )

09:05.000 --> 09:07.291
( honking continues )

09:14.583 --> 09:17.750
- ( people shouting )
- ( horns honking )

09:17.750 --> 09:20.792
- Good morning, sir. Hello.
- ( honking )

09:20.792 --> 09:22.917
( knocks )
Hello, hi, good morning.

09:22.917 --> 09:25.417
- Could you roll down
your window, please?
- What the fuck is going on now?

09:25.417 --> 09:26.834
Could you please--
thank you.

09:26.834 --> 09:29.083
I just want to say
this honking that you've
chosen to engage in,

09:29.083 --> 09:30.792
it's not gonna get you
off the block any faster.

09:30.792 --> 09:31.959
- ( honks )
- You know that, right?

09:31.959 --> 09:34.083
It's not serving
any purpose whatsoever.

09:34.083 --> 09:36.792
This isn't helping you,
it's not helping me,

09:36.792 --> 09:38.792
so I'm appealing to you
neighbor to neighbor

09:38.792 --> 09:40.959
about our noise pollution
problem, okay?

09:40.959 --> 09:43.542
I live right there,
and this incessant sound

09:43.542 --> 09:45.917
is prompting
my norepinephrine
production, okay?

09:45.917 --> 09:48.041
Who the fuck
made you mayor, huh?!

09:48.041 --> 09:51.291
Don't fucking look at me.
Beat it, motherfucker!

09:51.291 --> 09:53.667
( honking continues )

09:53.667 --> 09:57.834
This incessant sound
is doing irreparable damage,

09:57.834 --> 09:59.250
irreparably!

09:59.250 --> 10:01.125
You understand?
Stop honking! Stop!

10:01.125 --> 10:03.166
- Man #2: Fuck you!
- Stop! Stop the honking!

10:03.166 --> 10:04.959
Everybody, shut the fuck up!

10:04.959 --> 10:07.250
Shut the fuck up!

10:07.250 --> 10:10.458
Professor:
Before Chester reads
an excerpt from his story,

10:10.458 --> 10:13.333
a couple of you have
registered complaints
about something.

10:13.333 --> 10:19.000
Apparently, one of you
left a letter to the class
in the cubbies.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.542
Jeffrey:
I haven't checked mine.

10:20.542 --> 10:22.333
I was away camping
with my fraternity

10:22.333 --> 10:23.959
and I haven't
been back yet.

10:23.959 --> 10:26.208
- Who wrote the letter?
- It doesn't matter.

10:26.208 --> 10:27.708
It was Hannah.

10:27.708 --> 10:29.750
It was me.
I'm the one who wrote
the letter.

10:29.750 --> 10:33.041
I signed the letter.
I'm not ashamed of the letter.

10:34.041 --> 10:35.625
What did the letter say?

10:35.625 --> 10:39.375
The letter is a sincere
and heartfelt apology

10:39.375 --> 10:41.375
for my behavior last week
at the poet party.

10:41.375 --> 10:44.959
I think I became
a little exorcised

10:44.959 --> 10:46.625
in trying to share
my beliefs

10:46.625 --> 10:48.208
and I would like
to start anew.

10:48.208 --> 10:50.000
So this is me
starting anew.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.375
Well, I personally
feel very offended.

10:55.125 --> 10:57.708
( exhales )
Why were you offended, Logan?

10:57.708 --> 11:01.000
Well, Hannah,
where should I start?

11:01.000 --> 11:04.333
"I'm sorry I overreacted,
but I find it difficult

11:04.333 --> 11:06.125
to think clearly
in an environment

11:06.125 --> 11:07.917
that feels
like a minefield

11:07.917 --> 11:10.375
where anything
I do or say can be
misconstrued."

11:10.375 --> 11:12.333
- It's sort of
a run-on sentence.
- Sort of?

11:12.333 --> 11:14.959
Jeffrey, why don't we not
workshop my apology?

11:14.959 --> 11:17.667
I think that takes us
down a dangerous road,

11:17.667 --> 11:19.417
workshopping
each other's emotions.

11:19.417 --> 11:22.583
But, Hannah,
it's not really
an apology.

11:22.583 --> 11:25.542
It's actually
super defensive.

11:25.542 --> 11:29.166
"And now I find
that I cannot think
or write clearly

11:29.166 --> 11:31.583
due to the overwhelming
negative emotions around me,

11:31.583 --> 11:33.583
so I choose
to express myself here

11:33.583 --> 11:36.959
in order to shift
everyone's energy
towards me."

11:36.959 --> 11:38.667
It doesn't even make sense.

11:38.667 --> 11:40.750
Well, now I can't defend myself
from what you just said

11:40.750 --> 11:42.792
because you already
called me defensive.

11:42.792 --> 11:46.083
So if I'm to defend myself,
I'll seem even more defensive.

11:46.083 --> 11:49.542
So you're saying
that it's our fault
you can't write?

11:49.542 --> 11:52.708
I mean, I don't like
to use words like "fault,"
but, yes.

11:52.708 --> 11:54.333
( students laugh )

11:54.333 --> 11:56.542
Hannah, those cubbies
are sacred spaces.

11:56.542 --> 11:59.959
They are meant for sharing art,
you know, and not spewing hate.

11:59.959 --> 12:02.625
I forgot because
I haven't had a cubby
since kindergarten,

12:02.625 --> 12:04.250
so I forgot what we're
supposed to do with them.

12:04.250 --> 12:05.542
I thought you just drop
your Play-Doh--

12:05.542 --> 12:07.458
How else are we gonna
share these materials?

12:07.458 --> 12:10.250
You know, I feel very weird
about this whole encounter.

12:10.250 --> 12:11.291
How could you feel weird?

12:11.291 --> 12:13.041
You were camping
with your fraternity.

12:13.041 --> 12:14.792
You didn't even go
to your cubby.

12:14.792 --> 12:17.291
Plus, it's written
like a LiveJournal.

12:17.291 --> 12:19.083
( students laugh )

12:19.083 --> 12:21.333
Fine, I take it back.

12:21.333 --> 12:24.583
- ( students gasp )
- And I'm never going
to attempt another apology.

12:24.583 --> 12:25.792
It wasn't an apology!

12:25.792 --> 12:27.667
Jeffrey:
Hannah just threw
a piece of paper at me

12:27.667 --> 12:28.875
in a very aggressive
manner,

12:28.875 --> 12:31.834
- and I feel
extremely uncomfortable.
- Jeffrey, hush.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.333
Jeffrey, hush.
Be careful or she'll write

12:33.333 --> 12:34.917
another hate letter
and stick it in our cubbies.

12:34.917 --> 12:39.125
It wasn't a hate letter!
It was a heartfelt apology.

12:39.125 --> 12:41.000
What about that
was an apology?

12:41.000 --> 12:44.500
I said I'm sorry
in it a bunch.

12:44.500 --> 12:46.417
I'm sorry, I worked
really hard on my story.

12:46.417 --> 12:50.000
It's about a robot horse,
and I would really like
to get back to it.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.834
Actually,
this whole thing
with the letter

12:51.834 --> 12:53.708
actually kinda makes me
like you more.

12:53.708 --> 12:56.208
What if I pulled into
your driveway and started
leaning on the horn?

12:56.208 --> 12:57.500
How do you think
that'd make you feel?

12:57.500 --> 12:59.250
How do you think
your wife would feel
about that, huh?

12:59.250 --> 13:02.542
If I started just pushing
the fucking horn right through
the steering wheel?

13:02.542 --> 13:03.834
Right through
the fucking dash!

13:03.834 --> 13:05.333
- Hit that horn again!
Hit it again!
- ( honks horn )

13:05.333 --> 13:08.000
- Woman: What's your problem?
- Every man has his
breaking point!

13:08.000 --> 13:09.583
You want to see
my red line?

13:09.583 --> 13:11.166
You want to see
Ploshansky's red line?

13:11.166 --> 13:12.583
- Hit it again!
- ( horn honks )

13:12.583 --> 13:14.000
Look, you think
there's any correlation

13:14.000 --> 13:15.583
between that light
and that horn?

13:15.583 --> 13:17.708
Do you?
Do you think there's...

13:20.625 --> 13:22.875
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:22.875 --> 13:25.417
- Ray: How's it going?
- ( horns continue honking )

13:27.041 --> 13:29.083
What's up?

13:29.083 --> 13:31.542
You, um, in the middle
of something?

13:31.542 --> 13:34.125
No, just having
a little chat here

13:34.125 --> 13:36.583
in the dark corner
of the American experiment.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.875
What, you're just
walking through, or...?

13:38.875 --> 13:41.333
Yeah, yeah, I was just
in the neighborhood.

13:41.333 --> 13:43.375
But this isn't
your neighborhood.

13:43.375 --> 13:45.375
Are you going to work now

13:45.375 --> 13:46.625
like everyone else
except for me?

13:46.625 --> 13:49.792
No, I was actually
gonna go out and run
a few errands.

13:49.792 --> 13:52.875
- Can I come?
- You wanna come with me?

13:52.875 --> 13:55.166
Yeah, no, I mean, my life
is basically meaningless,

13:55.166 --> 13:57.291
so, yeah, I'd love to.

13:57.291 --> 13:59.667
I run errands
in a very precise
and focused way.

13:59.667 --> 14:02.917
Yeah, I'm precise
and focused.
I make lists.

14:02.917 --> 14:05.542
I mean, there's no, like,
bullshit, you know,
window-shopping.

14:05.542 --> 14:07.458
- There's none of that.
- I am not a window-shopper.

14:07.458 --> 14:09.917
Okay, no need
to get scratchy.
I'm just saying...

14:09.917 --> 14:13.875
( chatter )

14:13.875 --> 14:16.917
Professor:
Hey, Hannah, can you
stay behind for a sec?

14:16.917 --> 14:18.542
Mm-hmm.

14:19.417 --> 14:21.375
You can totally
come with me.

14:21.375 --> 14:23.583
( chatter )

14:25.250 --> 14:27.083
I can't believe
I'm getting punished for,

14:27.083 --> 14:29.333
you know, what--
a simple apology letter.

14:29.333 --> 14:32.583
It's like up is down.
You know what I mean?

14:32.583 --> 14:34.500
No one's punishing you.

14:34.500 --> 14:37.166
I'm just trying to figure out
how to help you.

14:37.166 --> 14:40.208
- I'm fine.
- No, you're not.

14:40.208 --> 14:43.250
Well, then, maybe
you should talk to
the rest of the class

14:43.250 --> 14:45.875
because they
have put me in a box
and now I'm suffocating.

14:45.875 --> 14:48.792
Mm. I think the thing
we can agree on

14:48.792 --> 14:52.291
is that you seem
very unhappy here.

14:52.291 --> 14:54.375
I'm not not happy.

14:54.375 --> 14:56.959
I think I could just--
I could be happier.

14:56.959 --> 15:00.792
Uh-huh, and I also sense
academia is challenging
for you.

15:00.792 --> 15:03.125
Academia is not
totally natural for me.

15:03.125 --> 15:05.458
I thrive on the streets.
I always have.

15:05.458 --> 15:08.959
Okay, listen.
Iowa is a specific place

15:08.959 --> 15:11.291
for a very specific
kind of writer.

15:11.291 --> 15:13.041
No, I know.

15:13.041 --> 15:14.208
What do you mean?

15:14.208 --> 15:16.417
It's not for everybody.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.083
Okay, am I getting
kicked out?

15:19.083 --> 15:21.250
No, you're not
getting kicked out.

15:21.250 --> 15:23.000
You know what you'd have
to do to get kicked out?

15:23.000 --> 15:24.333
What?

15:24.333 --> 15:27.000
You'd have to be
extremely violent
with another student.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.041
Not just a little violent,
but extremely violent.

15:31.041 --> 15:33.166
Everyone here is an adult

15:33.166 --> 15:36.834
and can make
their own choices.

15:36.834 --> 15:40.625
Okay, 'cause for a second
I thought I was getting
kicked out

15:40.625 --> 15:43.583
and I was so happy.

- Nothing.

16:13.583 --> 16:18.375
You know,
Marnie, things don't have
to be weird between us.

16:18.375 --> 16:20.041
It's not weird.

16:20.041 --> 16:23.333
Okay, but if things are weird,
let's, like, acknowledge it.

16:23.333 --> 16:26.291
There's nothing
to acknowledge, okay?

16:26.291 --> 16:28.208
- Really?
- It's all good,

16:28.208 --> 16:31.166
so let's
just keep working.

16:31.166 --> 16:34.041
You know, I'm happy
to apologize to you again

16:34.041 --> 16:35.708
if you think
that would be helpful.

16:35.708 --> 16:36.917
What the fuck?

16:36.917 --> 16:38.458
Nothing's weird.

16:38.458 --> 16:39.917
I'm fine.
I moved on.

16:39.917 --> 16:41.208
This is
our relationship now.

16:41.208 --> 16:43.875
- Okay.
- So let's just get
back to it, please.

16:43.875 --> 16:46.417
And this time,
actually play, please.

16:46.417 --> 16:50.166
She hated
everything and everyone,
especially me.

16:50.166 --> 16:53.500
Mom never told me
she tried to write a book.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.125
She's always saying,
you know, like,

16:55.125 --> 16:57.500
"An unbiased reader
is the greatest gift
to literature"

16:57.500 --> 17:00.834
and "Reading is
the godliest profession"
and blah, blah, blah.

17:00.834 --> 17:03.875
- She wrote a book?
- It was so long ago.

17:03.875 --> 17:08.333
- What happened?
- She was miserable,
so she quit.

17:08.333 --> 17:10.250
Suddenly she could
enjoy herself.

17:10.250 --> 17:13.083
We cooked, watched TV.

17:13.083 --> 17:16.416
She started swimming.

17:16.416 --> 17:18.250
So are you saying
I should quit Iowa?

17:18.250 --> 17:20.040
No, no, not at all.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.583
I was just trying
to talk about her.

17:21.583 --> 17:24.625
- You're different.
- Yeah, but what if I'm not?

17:24.625 --> 17:26.416
You got into
this great program.

17:26.416 --> 17:29.834
It's a big vote for you,
for what you do.

17:29.834 --> 17:31.500
Yeah, but I feel
so trapped.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.375
I feel so trapped,

17:33.375 --> 17:37.041
and there's no way
I can leave even
if I want to

17:37.041 --> 17:38.917
because of what
everyone will say.

17:38.917 --> 17:40.250
'Cause no one leaves.

17:40.250 --> 17:42.667
You can't think
of what anyone else
has to say.

17:42.667 --> 17:45.083
You just have to do
what's right for you.

17:45.083 --> 17:47.417
No matter what happens
to anyone else.

17:47.417 --> 17:49.959
What do you mean,
"No matter what happens
to anyone else"?

17:49.959 --> 17:52.542
I don't know.
I'm just-- I'm upset
because you're upset.

17:52.542 --> 17:54.083
Yeah, but now you seem
way more upset than me

17:54.083 --> 17:56.834
when I'm the one
who should actually
be really upset.

17:56.834 --> 18:00.834
All I'm saying is just
that sometimes the stupidest
fucking decision in the world

18:00.834 --> 18:02.083
is the right decision
for you.

18:02.083 --> 18:05.500
I don't know.
I've made a lot
of stupid decisions.

18:05.500 --> 18:08.667
Well, no one else
has to live in your mind.

18:08.667 --> 18:11.041
Only you.

18:11.041 --> 18:12.667
Okay?

18:13.667 --> 18:16.166
It's tiring.

18:18.166 --> 18:20.834
Wait, why are we going
to Forest Hills?

18:20.834 --> 18:24.166
I get my boxers and my T-shirts
at a specific department store

18:24.166 --> 18:25.583
and that's where
it's located.

18:25.583 --> 18:28.250
That's literally
the saddest thing I've
ever heard in my life.

18:28.250 --> 18:31.583
It's a ritual, Shosh, okay?
It calibrates me.

18:31.583 --> 18:33.291
It's very uplifting.
You should try it.

18:33.291 --> 18:34.708
No. No.

18:34.708 --> 18:36.125
No, I'm putting
my foot down.

18:36.125 --> 18:37.834
We are not going
to Forest Hills.

18:41.083 --> 18:43.625
This is a beautifully
constructed T-shirt.

18:43.625 --> 18:45.625
Are you
fucking kidding me?

18:45.625 --> 18:47.250
I know, the stitch work
is really wonderful.

18:47.250 --> 18:49.208
Ray: $70 for
a fucking T-shirt?

18:49.208 --> 18:50.792
Do you know how much
my T-shirts cost?

18:50.792 --> 18:53.375
- I don't want
to know how much--
- I get a four-pack for $12.

18:53.375 --> 18:54.625
Okay, how long
do they last?

18:54.625 --> 18:55.959
It's not supposed
to last very long.

18:55.959 --> 18:57.208
It's supposed to breathe
and wear down.

18:57.208 --> 18:58.959
If you're being
honest with yourself
from your inside,

18:58.959 --> 19:00.667
does it feel different
than your other T-shirts?

19:00.667 --> 19:04.834
I-- I just want
a six-pack of cotton boxers.
That's all I want.

19:04.834 --> 19:07.083
Ray, you have been wearing
the wrong T-shirts for years,

19:07.083 --> 19:11.208
and a T-shirt--
a T-shirt says who you are
to the world.

19:11.208 --> 19:13.083
Your entire life,
you have been telling
the world

19:13.083 --> 19:14.500
that you are a loser
who doesn't care.

19:14.500 --> 19:17.041
And that's not true anymore.
I watched that happen.

19:17.041 --> 19:19.500
You made that happen.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.291
Um...

19:26.291 --> 19:29.250
- ( dressing room
door closes )
- So, Ray...

19:31.417 --> 19:34.542
I've been following you
around all day waiting
to tell you something.

19:34.542 --> 19:37.000
I thought you were
following me around
'cause you're unemployed

19:37.000 --> 19:39.083
- and you're restless.
- Uh, well, yes.

19:39.083 --> 19:42.208
But I've also been wanting
to tell you something
for a while,

19:42.208 --> 19:45.333
and, um, I keep
trying to tell you
in all these different ways

19:45.333 --> 19:48.208
and it just keeps
coming out wrong instead,

19:48.208 --> 19:50.083
like, in stupid ways.

19:50.083 --> 19:51.583
( door opens )

19:52.417 --> 19:54.917
Okay, try me.

19:56.208 --> 19:57.959
I'm the reason
that our relationship ended.

19:57.959 --> 20:01.875
I wasn't ready
and I was unkind
and very rude

20:01.875 --> 20:05.208
and generally acted
in a way that I, um,

20:05.208 --> 20:07.542
don't want to be
remembered after I die.

20:07.542 --> 20:10.959
And, um, you were
a good boyfriend,

20:10.959 --> 20:12.959
and, um, I did love you.

20:12.959 --> 20:15.000
I was in love with you.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.583
And people always talk
about how love is like,

20:16.583 --> 20:18.625
you know,
the strongest emotion,
but I was scared,

20:18.625 --> 20:22.083
and sometimes
that's even stronger
for some people.

20:22.083 --> 20:24.000
Like, people like me.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.875
Look, I know
I'm not easy, okay?

20:25.875 --> 20:27.125
You don't have
to say all this.

20:27.125 --> 20:28.708
Well, no, I mean,
you're not easy.

20:28.708 --> 20:31.333
No, you're, like, actually
kind of awful sometimes

20:31.333 --> 20:33.875
and really hard to take
and maybe even a tiny bit
mentally ill.

20:33.875 --> 20:35.333
- Thanks.
- I don't know.

20:35.333 --> 20:37.458
But I hope that someday
I can show you how much
I did love you.

20:37.458 --> 20:40.458
I mean, like,
without getting back together
'cause that ship has sailed.

20:40.458 --> 20:42.542
- Yeah, Shosh--
- No, I mean, like,
that ship has sailed.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.708
Like, that ship
left the harbor.

20:44.708 --> 20:46.583
Um, I just--

20:46.583 --> 20:48.500
you know I like knowing
that I did love you

20:48.500 --> 20:50.625
'cause it makes me think
that I might be capable

20:50.625 --> 20:52.417
of something else great
someday.

20:52.417 --> 20:55.208
And for now, I would like
to offer myself to you

20:55.208 --> 20:56.625
as your true
and unyielding friend.

20:56.625 --> 20:59.834
And friends do not let
other friends buy underwear
in Forest Hills.

21:04.834 --> 21:07.000
( groans )

21:07.000 --> 21:09.333
What?

21:09.333 --> 21:12.834
I just don't want
to go back in there
and back to my life.

21:12.834 --> 21:14.208
Then don't.

21:14.208 --> 21:17.333
Come away with me
and we'll get on a plane,

21:17.333 --> 21:19.708
go somewhere
we've never gone before.

21:19.708 --> 21:21.375
What?

21:21.375 --> 21:24.083
Dad, ew.
Weird.

21:24.083 --> 21:29.417
I'm kidding, Banana.
It was a bad joke.

21:29.417 --> 21:33.375
Just, like,
how do you know if you've
made the right decision?

21:33.375 --> 21:35.875
I want to make
the right decision.

21:37.458 --> 21:40.208
You'll know
when you know.

21:40.208 --> 21:42.041
You know?

21:45.417 --> 21:47.375
Thanks for dinner.

21:48.542 --> 21:51.291
- I love you!
- Love you.

21:51.291 --> 21:54.250
- I'll call you
tomorrow!
- Okay!

21:54.250 --> 21:55.542
Bye!

22:04.417 --> 22:06.875
The neck of the shirt
is so loose.

22:06.875 --> 22:10.542
I feel the breeze rustling
every hair on my chest.

22:10.542 --> 22:11.542
Ew.

22:11.542 --> 22:13.625
So, you don't think
that I'm too simplistic?

22:13.625 --> 22:15.917
No, I think you're
the perfect amount
of simplistic.

22:15.917 --> 22:17.291
And you don't think
that I'm too blunt,
right?

22:17.291 --> 22:18.708
You would tell me if you
thought I was too blunt?

22:18.708 --> 22:21.625
Or is asking someone
if you're too blunt
being too blunt?

22:21.625 --> 22:23.500
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

22:23.500 --> 22:27.083
I'm sorry, I'm just feeling
a little insecure about
all this job rejection.

22:27.083 --> 22:29.834
Look, you'll find
the right job when
it's right, okay?

22:29.834 --> 22:31.959
You do things
in your own time, Shosh.

22:31.959 --> 22:33.375
You always have.

22:33.375 --> 22:35.917
( car horns honking )

22:35.917 --> 22:37.834
Ray:
Okay.

22:37.834 --> 22:40.208
I'm not gonna scream
in front of you, okay?

22:40.208 --> 22:43.917
That's something that I do
in private with them.

22:43.917 --> 22:46.417
I just feel like my path
towards a breakdown

22:46.417 --> 22:48.291
is lubricated with every
individual honk, you know?

22:48.291 --> 22:50.917
And I don't know
where all this anger
comes from.

22:50.917 --> 22:53.750
You've always been that angry.
It's like your essential nature.

22:53.750 --> 22:55.917
- ( honking continues )
- Oh.

22:55.917 --> 22:58.750
Maybe you should do something
instead of just screaming,
you know?

22:58.750 --> 23:01.417
Like, I don't know,
talk to de Blasio.

23:01.417 --> 23:03.291
Yeah, I'll just stroll
into the mayor's office
at City Hall

23:03.291 --> 23:04.792
and be like, "Hey, Billy,
you don't know me.

23:04.792 --> 23:08.125
I'm Ray Ploshansky.
I'm being sonically groped
for about 18 hours a day.

23:08.125 --> 23:11.208
Can we do something
about the monumentally
fucked-up traffic pattern

23:11.208 --> 23:13.542
- in my neighborhood, please?"
- Okay, whatever, Ray.

23:13.542 --> 23:15.625
I don't know, like,
go to a city council meeting

23:15.625 --> 23:16.750
like on those
boring C-SPAN shows

23:16.750 --> 23:19.333
where everyone has bad hair
and wears polyester.

23:19.333 --> 23:21.208
You're smart.
Use your brain.

23:21.208 --> 23:24.250
Put it into action
and you could totally
enact some change.

23:24.250 --> 23:26.542
- Shosh.
- Yeah?

23:26.542 --> 23:29.291
- I really hate this T-shirt.
- I hate that T-shirt so much.

23:29.291 --> 23:30.959
- It's awful.
- It's so bad.

23:30.959 --> 23:32.667
All right, thanks
for shopping with me.

23:32.667 --> 23:34.333
Yeah.

23:35.875 --> 23:38.166
- ( pounding on door )
- Desi: Marnie?

23:40.166 --> 23:42.583
We need to talk, Marn.

23:42.583 --> 23:44.125
Marnie!

23:44.125 --> 23:45.875
- ( pounding continues )
- Let me in.

23:45.875 --> 23:47.333
Desi?
Coming.

23:47.333 --> 23:49.291
- Desi: Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm coming.

23:49.291 --> 23:52.458
( pounding continues )

23:54.000 --> 23:56.667
- Marn!
- Okay, I'm right here,
I'm right here.

24:00.458 --> 24:03.083
- What's wrong?
- I did it.

24:03.083 --> 24:05.834
I fucking--
I fucking did it.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.708
( exhaling )

24:08.708 --> 24:10.542
You did what?

24:10.542 --> 24:13.166
Oh, man.

24:13.166 --> 24:14.875
I told Clementine
about us.

24:14.875 --> 24:18.000
I broke up with her.
I fucking did it.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.375
( sobbing )

24:30.834 --> 24:32.542
Oh, my God.

24:32.542 --> 24:35.208
What happened?

24:35.208 --> 24:36.959
What happened?

24:36.959 --> 24:40.208
( mumbles, sobbing )

24:40.208 --> 24:43.458
Sweetie, I don't know
what you're saying.

24:43.458 --> 24:49.083
It was the most
difficult thing
I ever did.

24:49.083 --> 24:51.708
Oh, my gosh,
this is so amazing.

24:51.708 --> 24:54.208
That's so beautiful.

24:54.208 --> 24:55.792
You're so emotional.

24:55.792 --> 24:58.834
This is so intense for you.

24:58.834 --> 25:02.417
This is so--
it's okay, it's okay.

25:02.417 --> 25:04.083
What made you
decide to do this?

25:04.083 --> 25:06.583
Because she--
( sobbing )

25:06.583 --> 25:08.417
It's okay.

25:11.250 --> 25:12.750
I'm here. Shh.

25:12.750 --> 25:14.875
- She told me...
- Yeah?

25:14.875 --> 25:18.542
...that she was thinking
about this guy sexually,

25:18.542 --> 25:22.083
and I think that
she's already fucked him.

25:28.834 --> 25:33.250
So, I'm confused.
Did she dump you?

25:33.250 --> 25:35.917
- It sounds like she dumped you.
- No, I dumped her.

25:35.917 --> 25:38.583
I definitely,
definitely dumped her.

25:38.583 --> 25:42.083
Can we not use that word?
It's so violent, you know?

25:43.417 --> 25:46.041
But so then maybe
you dumped her preemptively

25:46.041 --> 25:49.583
because you knew
that she was eventually
gonna dump you.

25:49.583 --> 25:50.667
( kisses )

25:50.667 --> 25:52.625
My Marnie.

26:00.333 --> 26:02.708
Oh, my God.
I love you.

26:02.708 --> 26:07.291
I love only you.
I love you so much.
