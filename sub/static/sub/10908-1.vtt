<i>If you had wings to lift you</i>

00:51.720 --> 00:53.764
<i>and the Second Star your guide,</i>

00:55.057 --> 00:59.937
<i>you'd find a place where
all the seasons flourish side by side.</i>

01:00.812 --> 01:04.524
<i>Yet past the Summer Meadow
and beyond the Autumn Wood,</i>

01:05.525 --> 01:10.489
<i>lies an icy land of secrets,
a world misunderstood.</i>

01:12.449 --> 01:16.912
<i>But if your mind is open
and your heart just has to know,</i>

01:17.663 --> 01:22.501
<i>your wings can take you farther
than you ever thought you'd go.</i>

01:30.926 --> 01:32.761

01:33.971 --> 01:37.766

01:37.849 --> 01:40.477

01:40.560 --> 01:44.147

02:29.109 --> 02:30.485
Look sharp, everyone!

02:30.569 --> 02:32.487
The snowy owls will soon be arriving

02:32.571 --> 02:35.741
to take the snowflake baskets
to the Winter Woods.

02:36.408 --> 02:39.494
Lucinda, stop noodling
and start tinkering.

02:44.958 --> 02:46.001
Is that the last load?

02:46.126 --> 02:48.003
- Thanks, Cheese.

02:49.588 --> 02:51.965
Basket weaving
is my favorite thing, Bobble.

02:52.049 --> 02:53.884
Really? I'm partial to macramé.

02:53.967 --> 02:55.719
Morning, Clank. Morning, Bobble.

02:55.802 --> 02:56.845
Morning!

02:57.429 --> 02:59.490
That should be enough
to finish the snowflake baskets.

02:59.514 --> 03:00.849
Aye, that will do her.

03:00.932 --> 03:02.684
- Thanks!

03:02.768 --> 03:05.270
Clanky.
- Oh! Sorry.

03:05.604 --> 03:07.147
I can't believe
we make the baskets,

03:07.230 --> 03:09.649
but don't get to take them
to the Winter Fairies.

03:09.733 --> 03:12.486
I mean, wouldn't you want to
go into the Winter Woods?

03:14.613 --> 03:16.865
Oh, we wouldn't last a day in that cold.

03:16.948 --> 03:19.743
Besides, I'm afraid of glaciers.

03:19.951 --> 03:20.952
Glaciers?

03:21.036 --> 03:23.413
They're known for their stealth.

03:23.997 --> 03:25.415
He's never actually seen one.

03:25.499 --> 03:26.833
You never do!

03:29.044 --> 03:30.045
The snowy owls!

03:32.297 --> 03:34.049
Places, everyone!

03:34.132 --> 03:35.926
Clank, Bobble, get that basket up.

03:36.009 --> 03:37.719
Right! Got it, Fairy Mary!

03:37.803 --> 03:38.970
Start the pulley!

04:04.454 --> 04:05.997
Ooh! Newcomer.

04:21.846 --> 04:22.847
Wow.

04:22.889 --> 04:24.891
The final shipment order.

04:25.225 --> 04:29.354
Oh, goodness! They need
20 more baskets for tomorrow's pickup.

04:46.037 --> 04:48.165
There's a whole other world over there.

04:48.248 --> 04:52.502
Well done, everyone!
The first shipment is headed for Winter.

04:52.586 --> 04:54.838
But there's much more to do
for tomorrow's pickup,

04:54.921 --> 04:57.757
so this is no time to rest on your laurels.

04:57.841 --> 05:00.886
Lucinda, get off your laurel
and get to work.

05:05.098 --> 05:06.641
Look out!

05:09.895 --> 05:11.021
Runaway bunny!

05:15.734 --> 05:16.818
No!

05:18.278 --> 05:20.155
- Got you!
- Thanks, Tink.

05:20.238 --> 05:21.656
No problem, Fawn.

05:21.740 --> 05:25.202
Come on, little guy.
It's still a long way to the Winter Woods.

05:25.285 --> 05:27.412
Oh, you're taking the animals today?

05:27.496 --> 05:28.538
Trying to.

05:28.622 --> 05:30.499
It's time for them to cross the border,

05:30.582 --> 05:32.834
but this little guy is a handful.

05:32.918 --> 05:35.420
Hey, uh, how about if I help?

05:37.589 --> 05:39.424
Slow down! Slow down!

05:40.175 --> 05:42.177
- Need some help?
- Nope. Doing fine.

05:42.260 --> 05:43.970
That lost thing really is handy.

05:44.054 --> 05:45.054
Yeah.

05:45.096 --> 05:47.307
Heel, Hoppy, heel! Slow down!

05:55.899 --> 05:57.317
Wow.

05:59.110 --> 06:01.112
Oh, don't be scared, little fellow.

06:01.196 --> 06:03.448
We'll let the weasels go first.

06:04.241 --> 06:07.953
Come on. Come on.
Come on!

06:09.037 --> 06:12.040
So, how far do we take the animals in?

06:12.123 --> 06:14.709
- Uh, Tink, we don't cross the border.
- Huh?

06:14.793 --> 06:16.211
We just help the animals cross.

06:16.294 --> 06:20.382
But I thought Animal Fairies
got to cross with the animals.

06:20.465 --> 06:22.384
Tink, it's freezing over there.

06:22.467 --> 06:25.345
Besides, no Warm Fairies
are allowed in the Winter Woods.

06:25.428 --> 06:27.889
Just like Winter Fairies
aren't allowed over here.

06:29.266 --> 06:30.850
Who made up that rule?

06:30.934 --> 06:33.728
I think it was the Lord of Winter.

06:33.812 --> 06:35.021
Winter has a lord?

06:35.105 --> 06:36.898
All right, guys. You ready?

06:46.449 --> 06:48.994
- Wow.
- Pretty great, huh?

06:51.496 --> 06:52.831
It's incredible.

06:52.914 --> 06:55.584
They get their winter coats
to protect them from the cold.

06:56.543 --> 06:59.629
Your turn. Go on.

07:06.845 --> 07:09.180
Go on, now. Follow your brothers.

07:28.366 --> 07:29.451
Bye-bye!

07:29.534 --> 07:31.369
All right, big guy.

07:31.786 --> 07:33.204
- Oh, no.

07:34.873 --> 07:36.124
No hibernating yet.

07:36.207 --> 07:37.667
- You do that in Winter!

07:38.418 --> 07:40.712
Come on. Come on!

07:41.796 --> 07:44.257
Wake up. Wake up.

07:44.841 --> 07:45.925
Oh...

07:46.092 --> 07:47.302
Come on.

07:47.385 --> 07:49.220
- Wake up.

07:49.596 --> 07:51.097
Rise and shine.

07:53.183 --> 07:54.392
Ooh!

08:15.121 --> 08:16.164
Ooh!

08:34.765 --> 08:35.933
Oh...

08:39.145 --> 08:40.980
Tink!

08:41.523 --> 08:43.149
Tink!

08:43.232 --> 08:44.609
- Tinker Bell!
- What?

08:49.823 --> 08:53.159
Oh, Tink! I told you,
we're not allowed to cross.

08:55.787 --> 08:56.787
Your wings.

08:56.830 --> 08:58.164
I know!

08:58.248 --> 08:59.708
They were sparkling.

08:59.791 --> 09:01.334
They're freezing!

09:01.418 --> 09:03.218
We'd better get you
to a Healing Talent Fairy.

09:03.253 --> 09:04.462
- But...
- Come on.

09:10.510 --> 09:11.761
May I help you?

09:11.845 --> 09:13.012
How much longer?

09:13.096 --> 09:16.808
I told you,
a rainbow collision is not an emergency.

09:17.642 --> 09:19.227
But the purple's starting to itch.

09:19.310 --> 09:20.729
Take a seat.

09:26.484 --> 09:28.236
Oh! Snapdragon, right?

09:28.319 --> 09:29.362
Mmm-hmm.

09:29.446 --> 09:31.364
Not an emergency. Plant it over there.

09:31.448 --> 09:32.448
Thank you.

09:32.490 --> 09:34.784
Hurry, girls.
What if we're too late?

09:36.077 --> 09:38.371
- Oh! Sorry. Do you know...
- Window.

09:43.460 --> 09:45.670
- Uh, uh, uh, uh!

09:46.004 --> 09:47.088
Patient's name?

09:47.172 --> 09:48.548
Tinker Bell.

09:48.631 --> 09:51.009
Oh, yes. The border crosser. She's...

09:51.092 --> 09:52.552
Frozen solid?

09:53.136 --> 09:54.804
- Room two.
- Oh, my.

09:54.888 --> 09:56.139
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

09:56.514 --> 09:57.932
- This way!
- Come on, girls. Hurry.

09:58.016 --> 09:59.434
She's right over here.
Room two.

09:59.517 --> 10:00.852
- There she is.
- Tink!

10:01.853 --> 10:03.271
We got here as quick as we could.

10:03.354 --> 10:04.939
We did have to stop at reception.

10:05.023 --> 10:07.233
- Did you really cross?

10:08.026 --> 10:09.068
Well, did you?

10:09.194 --> 10:10.236
Shh!

10:12.739 --> 10:13.823
- Hmm...
- Whoa.

10:13.907 --> 10:14.908
Shh!

10:15.700 --> 10:16.951
Mmm-hmm.

10:18.036 --> 10:21.039
Okay. You're all warmed up.
Let's test your wings.

10:21.122 --> 10:22.248
Oh! Sure.

10:22.332 --> 10:23.333
Open.

10:23.416 --> 10:25.251
Mmm. Close.

10:25.335 --> 10:27.378
And try a little flap.

10:28.087 --> 10:29.422
A flutter.

10:29.756 --> 10:31.758
Can you give me a flitter?

10:32.091 --> 10:36.554
Okay. Well, I don't see anything
unusual. Your wings appear to be fine.

10:37.972 --> 10:41.226
But what about the sparkling?

10:41.309 --> 10:43.353
It must have been the light
reflecting off the snow.

10:43.436 --> 10:44.497
- But...
- You should have never

10:44.521 --> 10:45.521
crossed the border.

10:45.563 --> 10:48.191
Winter is too cold
for our Warm Fairy wings.

10:48.274 --> 10:51.277
Now, to be safe,
I want you to take two sunflower seeds

10:51.361 --> 10:53.905
and come back if there is any problem.

10:54.656 --> 10:56.407
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

10:56.741 --> 10:58.284
We were worried, Tink.

10:58.368 --> 11:00.662
Oh! You are so lucky
nothing happened to your wings.

11:00.745 --> 11:02.121
Can you imagine?

11:02.205 --> 11:05.124
But something did happen
They sparkled!

11:05.208 --> 11:08.378
But you heard her. It was just the light
reflecting off the snow.

11:08.461 --> 11:11.756
No, it wasn't. They actually lit up.

11:12.590 --> 11:15.385
It was brighter than a thousand fireflies.

11:15.927 --> 11:18.096
You saw it. Didn't you, Fawn?

11:18.429 --> 11:19.429
No.

11:21.266 --> 11:22.809
You don't believe me?

11:22.976 --> 11:24.352
Who... Um...

11:24.435 --> 11:25.937
Uh... No?

11:26.521 --> 11:30.233
Look, you guys, it happened.
It felt like...

11:30.400 --> 11:32.235
- Like...
- Like What?

11:33.319 --> 11:37.282
Like the Winter Woods was calling me.

11:37.991 --> 11:39.325
You know?

11:41.703 --> 11:45.373
Not really.
Get the doctor.

11:46.624 --> 11:50.461
Animal Fairy Books,
101 Uses for Pixie Dust,

11:50.545 --> 11:52.171
Beauty and the Bees...

11:52.422 --> 11:54.299
There's got to be a wing book
here somewhere.

11:54.799 --> 11:57.802
<i>Rules for Rainbow Riding.</i> No, not that.

11:58.386 --> 11:59.888
Huh? Hey.

11:59.971 --> 12:01.848
Someone's been eating the books!

12:03.516 --> 12:04.851
Bookworms.

12:05.810 --> 12:07.186
Oh. What's this?

12:07.437 --> 12:08.438
Ah!

12:09.147 --> 12:10.273
Light reading.

12:10.857 --> 12:13.192
Dustology, windology...

12:13.318 --> 12:14.319
A-ha!

12:14.485 --> 12:16.821
Wingology. That's got to have it.

12:20.199 --> 12:21.200
Oh!

12:26.497 --> 12:27.624
Got you!

12:27.916 --> 12:28.917
Ahem.

12:29.626 --> 12:30.793
Sorry.

12:30.960 --> 12:31.961
Mmm-hmm.

12:33.713 --> 12:35.214
Okay, let's see.

12:35.381 --> 12:37.383
Wing care. Wing washing. Wing tips.

12:37.550 --> 12:39.802
"Don't get them wet."
Everybody knows that.

12:39.969 --> 12:43.431
Sizes, shapes, flapping, fluttering.

12:43.514 --> 12:45.808
Sparkling! I knew it!

12:46.142 --> 12:47.143
Oh!

12:49.270 --> 12:51.272
Sorry. Found it!

12:52.315 --> 12:53.316
Huh?

12:54.108 --> 12:55.109
Oh, no.

12:57.028 --> 12:58.529
Thanks a lot.

13:01.199 --> 13:02.200
Hmm.

13:02.951 --> 13:03.993
Okay.

13:04.077 --> 13:08.665
"Sparkling wings.
When a most incredible..."

13:08.748 --> 13:11.042
"that the sparkle... There were two."

13:11.125 --> 13:12.168
Huh?

13:12.251 --> 13:14.796
"That the sparkle... There were two."

13:14.879 --> 13:19.258
Two wings? Two feet?
Two what?

13:22.387 --> 13:23.596
- Psst.
- Oh!

13:23.680 --> 13:25.723
- Yes?
- Hey.

13:25.807 --> 13:28.893
Do you know anything
about sparkling wings?

13:29.477 --> 13:31.980
No. The bookworm ate that page.

13:32.063 --> 13:33.648
Yeah, I know.

13:33.731 --> 13:35.650
But the Keeper does.

13:35.733 --> 13:37.527
The Keeper? Who's the Keeper?

13:38.736 --> 13:43.199
He writes the books.
He is the keeper of all fairy knowledge.

13:43.449 --> 13:46.577
That's perfect. Is he here?
I have to talk to him.

13:46.661 --> 13:51.582
I would give anything
to talk to him. But you can't.

13:52.333 --> 13:53.334
Why not?

13:53.418 --> 13:54.711
Because he's a Winter Fairy.

13:54.794 --> 13:58.881
In order to talk to him, you would have
to go to the Winter Woods.

13:58.965 --> 14:02.260
And that's impossible.
Your wings will freeze and...

14:03.594 --> 14:04.929
Chapter 16.

14:06.764 --> 14:09.100
Hmm. The Winter Woods.

14:45.386 --> 14:46.387
Hmm.

14:56.189 --> 14:57.523
Can't fly.

14:57.899 --> 15:02.862
Hurry, now, hurry!
Let's finish up. Stand by with the pulley.

15:02.945 --> 15:08.242
All right! It's this season's final pickup,
so let's make it our best.

15:08.451 --> 15:13.206
Lucinda, let's leave the loafing
for the Baking Fairies.

15:13.873 --> 15:15.666
- Okay, Clanky.
- Right!

15:15.750 --> 15:16.751
Ouch!

15:16.834 --> 15:19.337
Snowflake release system working!

15:19.921 --> 15:22.840
Maybe you should
be the test snowflake for a while.

15:22.924 --> 15:24.175
- Tink?
- Huh?

15:24.509 --> 15:26.177
We already checked that basket.

15:26.761 --> 15:28.304
Right. uh...

15:32.683 --> 15:34.519
Why are you dressed all cozy?

15:35.353 --> 15:36.979
I'm going to the Winter Woods.

15:37.146 --> 15:38.731
The Winter Woods?

15:39.148 --> 15:40.149
Shh!

15:40.525 --> 15:41.776
The Winter Woods?

15:41.859 --> 15:42.944
Places, everyone!

15:43.027 --> 15:44.362
The snowy owls. They're here!

15:44.445 --> 15:46.781
Start the pulley!

15:46.864 --> 15:47.990
Bye!

15:50.660 --> 15:52.328
Tink! Wait!

15:52.829 --> 15:55.414
You can't cross the border, Miss Bell.
Your wings!

15:55.498 --> 15:57.333
Don't worry. They're in my coat.

15:57.416 --> 15:59.252
Does this have to do with the...

16:00.878 --> 16:02.630
- The sparkling?
- Yes.

16:02.713 --> 16:04.953
There's somebody in Winter
who can tell me what it means.

16:05.007 --> 16:08.136
Clank! Bobble!
Ls something wrong with that basket?

16:08.219 --> 16:09.470
What? Oh!

16:12.849 --> 16:14.016
Tink?

16:14.100 --> 16:15.852
I just have to do this.

16:17.562 --> 16:20.064
No, no. Everything is fine.

16:20.148 --> 16:24.026
We're just sad to see it go.
Pretty basket.

16:24.110 --> 16:27.071
Oh! Honestly. Let it go!

16:37.415 --> 16:38.666
That's the new one.

16:38.749 --> 16:40.751
- Uh, new one?
- Mmm-hmm.

17:07.111 --> 17:11.781
Excellent work, everyone.
They're off to the cold of winter.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.952
Well, that's that until next year.

18:06.837 --> 18:08.506
Wow. I made it.

18:10.091 --> 18:11.842
Welcome back.

18:12.218 --> 18:13.761
A Winter Fairy.

18:14.428 --> 18:16.180
- You ready for the drop-off?

18:16.430 --> 18:19.225
Come on. You did it yesterday.
You'll be fine.

18:20.017 --> 18:22.186
All right then. Here we go.

18:43.666 --> 18:44.667
Ah!

18:56.721 --> 18:57.972
Look Out!

19:04.770 --> 19:06.439
Sorry about that.

19:10.526 --> 19:11.736
Oh, no.

19:30.546 --> 19:31.546
Lord Milori.

19:34.383 --> 19:36.052
And what happened here?

19:36.260 --> 19:40.598
A bit of a bumpy landing.
It's only his second drop-off.

19:40.681 --> 19:44.310
As long as the basket made it,
I'd say he did just fine.

19:44.727 --> 19:46.270
- How was the crossing?

19:46.354 --> 19:48.689
Four bunnies,
two weasels, and a marmot.

19:48.773 --> 19:49.893
And they all crossed safely.

19:49.940 --> 19:52.735
Yes. I met up with them
on the north side.

19:53.611 --> 19:56.364
The snowflakes
are looking quite beautiful.

19:56.447 --> 19:58.366
NO two alike.

20:02.787 --> 20:03.829
No, no, no.

20:03.913 --> 20:05.998
Ambitious.

20:06.290 --> 20:07.291
Hmm.

20:09.752 --> 20:11.212
Now that is odd.

20:11.379 --> 20:12.380
Oh!

20:12.963 --> 20:15.466
It must have been left
in the basket by accident.

20:16.550 --> 20:17.635
Return this to the Keeper.

20:17.718 --> 20:18.761
The Keeper.

20:18.844 --> 20:23.307
He can send it back
to the Warm Side with his next delivery.

20:38.239 --> 20:42.243
It must have come from
the Warm Side. In one of the baskets.

20:42.660 --> 20:43.869
Thanks.

21:17.820 --> 21:18.946
Whoa!

21:19.029 --> 21:21.157
That's the end of that chapter.

21:21.949 --> 21:23.659
Boy, that's a beauty.

21:23.826 --> 21:26.620
<i>Flora and Fauna of the Fairies.</i>

21:28.497 --> 21:32.126
Put a period there,
then we are pretty much done.

21:33.169 --> 21:36.130
Wait. I forgot to number the pages.

21:36.213 --> 21:39.633
Oh! I'm going to have to start all over
on this large book.

21:39.717 --> 21:41.135
- Keeper. Keeper!
- Yes, what...

21:41.260 --> 21:43.637
The most amazing thing
happened. You'll never believe it.

21:43.721 --> 21:45.306
Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming.

21:45.389 --> 21:46.616
I've never felt anything like it!

21:46.640 --> 21:49.643
My friends didn't believe me,
but how could they because it's so...

21:49.727 --> 21:52.229
Slow down.
I can only listen so fast.

21:52.313 --> 21:54.565
Yesterday,
at the border, my wings.

21:54.648 --> 21:57.693
They actually... They lit up.

21:58.527 --> 22:00.070
It's happening again!

22:02.698 --> 22:03.908
Oh...

22:04.492 --> 22:06.827
Well, I'll be a yeti's uncle.

22:24.428 --> 22:26.722
In all my years.

22:32.853 --> 22:35.898
Your wings. They're sparkling.

22:36.815 --> 22:37.983
Like yours.

22:39.735 --> 22:41.487
I've written about the sparkling,

22:41.570 --> 22:44.907
but I've never seen the sparkling
with my own peepers!

22:46.992 --> 22:48.827
Oh, uh, follow me.

22:52.289 --> 22:56.126
Now, step the footsies on the snowflake.

23:15.813 --> 23:19.316
Just put your wings into the light.

23:37.001 --> 23:38.419
The mainland.

24:05.696 --> 24:06.822
Oh, no.

24:50.908 --> 24:52.242
Hello?

24:52.368 --> 24:53.744
Hello.

24:55.245 --> 24:56.246
Hello?

25:02.419 --> 25:05.756
Two fairies born of the same laugh.

25:06.548 --> 25:09.009
So that means...

25:09.093 --> 25:10.511
You're my...

25:10.761 --> 25:12.388
So we're

25:14.056 --> 25:15.516
sisters.

25:16.433 --> 25:19.853
Yes! And your wings are identical.

25:20.020 --> 25:21.772
That is why they sparkle.

25:30.781 --> 25:32.741
Jingles!

25:34.284 --> 25:37.871
Ah... Oh, boy.
Maybe you shouldn't do that.

25:40.124 --> 25:42.418
Um, I'm Tinker Bell.

25:42.501 --> 25:44.169
I'm Periwinkle.

25:44.461 --> 25:46.213
So you must have been at the border.

25:46.296 --> 25:48.507
Yeah. I was hoping to see
the animals cross.

25:48.716 --> 25:50.092
I guess I didn't see you.

25:50.175 --> 25:52.594
Me either.

25:53.846 --> 25:54.847
What?

25:57.808 --> 26:00.018
I usually just wear them at home.

26:02.062 --> 26:03.564
- Wow.
- Hello.

26:03.647 --> 26:05.733
Keeper, are you in?

26:05.816 --> 26:07.901
Yumping yetis, Lord Milori!

26:07.985 --> 26:09.425
If he sees you, he'll send you back.

26:09.486 --> 26:11.739
Keeper? Are you here?

26:11.822 --> 26:14.158
Don't worry.
I'm going to take care of this.

26:14.908 --> 26:15.993
Where are you?

26:16.994 --> 26:19.663
Ah. Come back later!

26:19.788 --> 26:20.998
Keeper?

26:21.081 --> 26:23.333
Whoa, boy. Can't get that one back.

26:23.417 --> 26:24.960
I need to speak with you.

26:25.043 --> 26:26.587
It's important.

26:27.755 --> 26:29.631
I'll be right back.

26:31.175 --> 26:33.886
I'm right here, Lord Milori.

26:33.969 --> 26:35.512
Did you receive that wing book?

26:35.596 --> 26:37.431
You know, once upon a time,

26:37.514 --> 26:40.768
you'd stop by just to say hello
and howdy-do.

26:40.851 --> 26:43.479
I'm sorry. Hello.

26:43.812 --> 26:45.105
Howdy-dg?

26:45.189 --> 26:46.857
Howdy-do.

26:48.150 --> 26:52.070
This book has me worried.
What if a Warm Fairy brought it here?

26:53.947 --> 26:56.909
Well, that might be nice,
then, meeting a Warm Fairy.

26:56.992 --> 26:59.703
Especially one
with such good taste in books.

26:59.787 --> 27:01.288
It's too cold.

27:01.371 --> 27:03.540
Maybe if they were wearing a coat,

27:03.624 --> 27:05.584
or one of them little sweater vests.

27:05.667 --> 27:06.987
- They're nice.
- I'll remind you.

27:07.044 --> 27:08.879
Crossing the border is forbidden.

27:08.962 --> 27:10.631
There was a time when it wasn't.

27:10.714 --> 27:14.468
The rule is there to keep the fairies safe.
That will never change.

27:14.551 --> 27:15.551
But I...

27:15.594 --> 27:20.057
If a Warm Fairy comes here,
you will send them back.

27:21.183 --> 27:22.684
Of course.

27:24.978 --> 27:26.313
Thank you.

27:34.154 --> 27:36.281
Well, you heard the Lord Milori.

27:36.865 --> 27:39.409
He said you must go back home.

27:40.911 --> 27:42.454
Of course, he didn't say when.

27:43.664 --> 27:46.667
Now, listen, you two,
it gets colder after the dark,

27:46.750 --> 27:49.962
so it's best to get Tinker Bell
home before the first moonlight.

27:50.045 --> 27:51.588
Thank you, Dewey.

27:51.672 --> 27:52.756
Dewey?

27:53.590 --> 27:55.008
That's his real name.

27:55.175 --> 27:57.469
It's what my friends call me.

27:59.429 --> 28:00.472
Thank you.

28:00.931 --> 28:01.932
Dewey.

28:03.016 --> 28:04.184
Dewey.

28:04.643 --> 28:08.230
So, um, I'm a Frost Fairy. If rost things.

28:08.313 --> 28:11.108
- Oh. I'm a Tinker. I...
- Tinker things?

28:11.191 --> 28:13.026
Yep. I even made this coat.

28:13.110 --> 28:14.862
- Oh, I like it.
- Thanks.

28:14.945 --> 28:15.988
You're welcome.

28:16.071 --> 28:17.114
Sisters.

28:17.489 --> 28:21.535
It's amazing. The dust travels
all the way from the Pixie Dust Tree.

28:21.618 --> 28:22.995
Kind of like you did.

28:23.078 --> 28:25.205
Terence and I
barely escaped the pirate ship!

28:25.289 --> 28:27.291
- Is he your boyfriend?
- Uh...

28:27.749 --> 28:29.668
So Lizzy loves fairies?

28:29.751 --> 28:32.087
Yeah. She even built a fairy house.

28:32.170 --> 28:34.381
That's how I met her.
You see, me and Vidia...

28:39.928 --> 28:42.180
You collect lost things, too?

28:42.264 --> 28:44.099
I call them found things.

28:44.182 --> 28:48.478
<i>♪ I never knew
I lost you till I found you.</i>

28:50.647 --> 28:55.903
<i>♪ And you'd never guess
how close you are to me.</i>

28:57.195 --> 29:00.741
<i>♪ Now I want to

29:00.824 --> 29:04.286
<i>♪ Tell a thousand tales

29:04.369 --> 29:09.708

29:32.230 --> 29:33.440
<i>♪ Anymore.</i>

29:33.523 --> 29:34.858
This is the Frost Forest.

29:34.942 --> 29:36.652
WOW.

29:36.735 --> 29:37.861
That's Gliss.

29:40.530 --> 29:42.824
Come on, Spike. Practice.

29:44.034 --> 29:46.286
Okay, okay. Practicing.

29:46.370 --> 29:48.956
And that's Spike. She's a bit...

29:49.039 --> 29:50.040
Whoa!

29:56.213 --> 29:58.215
- Hi.
- Sisters?

29:58.298 --> 30:00.384
Well, I think it's fantastic!

30:00.467 --> 30:04.012
Wow, you two look exactly alike!

30:04.096 --> 30:07.933
I mean, except for your clothes
and your hair and Peri's a bit more pale.

30:08.016 --> 30:09.977
But your noses are very similar.

30:10.060 --> 30:13.897
Forget their noses.
She's a Warm Fairy. In Winter!

30:14.356 --> 30:17.234
You're right.
We got to show her around!

30:17.317 --> 30:18.360
Oh, Oh, Oh!

30:18.485 --> 30:21.238
Let's take her ice sliding!
Come on, Spike!

30:21.321 --> 30:22.781
You are going to love this!

30:22.864 --> 30:24.116
It sounds fun.

30:24.199 --> 30:27.160
Yeah. Great idea.
Push the Warm Fairy down a hill of ice.

30:28.662 --> 30:30.163
Okay, well, wait for me, you guys.

30:30.455 --> 30:35.752
<i>♪ And if you'll be there

30:36.795 --> 30:40.590

31:12.706 --> 31:15.584
Um... I know. Favorite star?

31:15.667 --> 31:16.752
Second star

31:16.835 --> 31:17.955
to the right.
- To the right.

31:18.587 --> 31:21.548
Okay. Favorite drink?

31:21.631 --> 31:23.050
Hot chamomile tea.

31:23.133 --> 31:24.634
Iced chamomile tea!

31:24.718 --> 31:26.011
- Oh!

31:26.094 --> 31:29.222
Okay, my turn. How about favorite bug?

31:29.306 --> 31:32.017
Bug? It's too cold for bugs over here,

31:32.100 --> 31:34.978
but in one of Dewey's books,
I read about butterflies.

31:35.062 --> 31:37.939
Oh, in Butterfly Cove,
there's hundreds of them.

31:38.231 --> 31:40.317
It's in Summer. It's right over...

31:41.109 --> 31:42.694
Um... Hmm.

31:43.403 --> 31:44.905
I guess you can't see it from here.

31:46.323 --> 31:48.241
No. You can't.

31:49.159 --> 31:50.577
What's it like over there?

31:50.660 --> 31:51.661
Warm.

31:52.162 --> 31:54.039
And the colors? The sounds?

31:54.122 --> 31:56.166
All the animals. And the fish.

31:56.249 --> 31:57.667
They swim in melted ice, right?

31:57.751 --> 31:58.877
Water.

32:00.170 --> 32:01.838
I wish...

32:02.714 --> 32:04.674
I wish I could go there.

32:09.346 --> 32:10.972
- Peri?
- Yeah?

32:14.142 --> 32:19.022
I made it warmer over here.
Maybe I could make it colder over there.

32:19.272 --> 32:20.607
Are you...

32:21.024 --> 32:22.609
Are you saying I could cross?

32:23.527 --> 32:25.529
- Yeah!
- Oh, Tink.

32:25.987 --> 32:27.531
You could show me your world.

32:27.614 --> 32:29.658
I could meet your friends.

32:29.741 --> 32:31.284
Do you think I could see a butterfly?

32:31.368 --> 32:33.120
There's a pretty good chance.

32:33.203 --> 32:35.205
- Oh!

32:38.834 --> 32:40.043
Uh, Tink?

32:43.672 --> 32:45.215
- I can't fly!
- Tink!

32:46.716 --> 32:48.218
Hold on. Hold on!

32:50.137 --> 32:51.221
I'm slipping!

32:55.392 --> 32:58.395
That's it, Fiona. That's it.

32:59.896 --> 33:01.481
Are you girls all right?

33:01.898 --> 33:03.608
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:03.942 --> 33:07.237
Are you sure? Nothing broken?
Nothing bruised?

33:07.404 --> 33:09.823
No. We're okay.

33:09.906 --> 33:12.117
This time.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.536
Lord Milori was right.

33:15.245 --> 33:18.206
Crossing the border
is just too dangerous.

33:19.249 --> 33:20.375
What are you saying?

33:20.458 --> 33:22.002
I'm sorry, girls,

33:22.085 --> 33:26.715
but I'm afraid this isn't going to work out
like you hoped.

33:26.882 --> 33:29.259
We have to take Tinker Bell home.

33:34.347 --> 33:35.682
Let's go, Fiona.

33:51.656 --> 33:52.866
It's...

33:53.116 --> 33:54.784
It's for your own good.

34:24.313 --> 34:25.899
I can't watch, Fiona.

34:27.900 --> 34:30.570
I promised myself
I wasn't going to do this.

34:30.654 --> 34:33.572
Okay. Here's the plan.
Meet me here tomorrow.

34:33.822 --> 34:36.743
Oh, thank goodness. I thought
you were really saying goodbye.

34:36.826 --> 34:38.911
No! I just met my sister
I never knew I had

34:38.995 --> 34:41.873
and I'm going to say goodbye forever?
Are you kidding?

34:41.956 --> 34:43.166
So...

34:46.835 --> 34:48.505
Clank? Bobble?

34:50.799 --> 34:52.007
Guys?

35:02.644 --> 35:03.979
Oopsie.

35:04.062 --> 35:06.064
Tink! You're back!

35:07.691 --> 35:09.693
- Yes.
- Sorry!

35:09.776 --> 35:12.112
We thought you were a troll.

35:12.195 --> 35:13.196
A troll?

35:13.280 --> 35:15.160
I knew we shouldn't have used
the troll stopper.

35:15.198 --> 35:16.741
What if it was a troll?

35:16.825 --> 35:18.636
You'd be saying something different,
wouldn't you?

35:18.660 --> 35:20.120
Guys. It doesn't matter.

35:20.203 --> 35:21.538
Oh, right.

35:21.871 --> 35:24.874
- I need your help.
- Is it about a glacier?

35:25.709 --> 35:28.878
No. But it's kind of a secret.

35:29.129 --> 35:30.714
I don't want everybody to know.

35:33.800 --> 35:37.345
I'm pretty sure these buttons will work,
but we're going to need more of them.

35:37.429 --> 35:40.265
Aye, unless we use
a couple of acorn caps.

35:40.348 --> 35:41.891
Right! Good idea.

35:41.975 --> 35:44.227
Whoo! Now where is that Clanky?

35:44.311 --> 35:46.479
Oh, yes, I'm right here.

35:46.563 --> 35:47.564
Oh!

35:48.398 --> 35:51.067
I didn't tell everybody.

35:51.860 --> 35:55.697
Just Fawn, Ro, Sil, Dess, and Vidia.

35:56.489 --> 35:59.117
So, there's another you.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.077
- Vidia!
- Yeah.

36:01.286 --> 36:02.495
I've got a sister.

36:02.579 --> 36:04.456
I told you!

36:04.539 --> 36:05.665
Bust my bonnet.

36:05.749 --> 36:07.625
- Amazing!
- It's fantastic!

36:07.709 --> 36:08.936
I can't believe this is happening.

36:08.960 --> 36:10.003
But how?

36:10.086 --> 36:12.756
They were born of the same laugh!

36:12.839 --> 36:15.759
Tell them, Tink,
what you told me and Bobble.

36:16.760 --> 36:18.428
Her name's Periwinkle.

36:18.511 --> 36:22.474
She's a Frost Fairy,
and she's just amazing.

36:22.557 --> 36:25.060
I'm making this machine
so she can come here and meet you all,

36:25.143 --> 36:27.479
and after that
we'll go straight to Queen Clarion!

36:27.604 --> 36:28.855
Oh...

36:28.938 --> 36:31.566
Um, have you thought this through?

36:31.649 --> 36:35.236
"Hi, Queen Clarion. Meet the Winter
Fairy I smuggled over the border."

36:35.320 --> 36:36.696
Vidia!

36:36.780 --> 36:38.782
When Queen Clarion
hears how we found each other,

36:38.865 --> 36:40.033
and that we're sisters,

36:40.116 --> 36:41.951
she will change Lord Milori's rule.

36:42.035 --> 36:43.787
Oh, of course she will.

36:43.870 --> 36:45.538
She'd never want you to be apart.

36:45.622 --> 36:48.375
It's like you found the perfect lost thing.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.503
And I'm never going to lose her.

36:51.628 --> 36:53.380
Well, then, let's get to work!

36:53.463 --> 36:54.881
Just tell us what to do.

36:54.964 --> 36:55.964
Great!

36:56.007 --> 36:57.767
Okay. We need to place
that wheel right here.

36:57.801 --> 36:58.802
Got you, Tink.

36:58.885 --> 37:00.762
And let's get that propped up over there.

37:00.845 --> 37:02.180
I feel so tinkery.

37:02.263 --> 37:03.765
- Clank, Bobble...
- Wait, wait.

37:03.848 --> 37:04.891
Finish up the chassis?

37:04.974 --> 37:06.184
Exactly.

37:06.267 --> 37:07.936
- Come on, Clanky!
- Bobble!

37:08.019 --> 37:12.190
Perhaps you and I are brothers!
It's possible.

37:12.273 --> 37:14.317
We look almost exactly alike.

37:23.701 --> 37:24.702
Anyone see you?

37:24.994 --> 37:25.995
No.

37:26.079 --> 37:27.664
I can't believe we're doing this!

37:29.457 --> 37:30.750
So, did you bring it?

37:30.834 --> 37:32.794
Yes.

37:33.503 --> 37:35.046
Watch the branch.

37:37.132 --> 37:39.050
Careful. More to the right.

37:39.134 --> 37:43.388
For the record, we shouldn't be doing
this, whatever it is we're doing.

37:44.722 --> 37:47.684
As ordered. One big block of ice.

37:47.767 --> 37:50.395
Courtesy of our resident glacier fairy.

37:50.854 --> 37:52.021
Hey.

37:52.188 --> 37:53.565
So, what do you think?

37:53.648 --> 37:54.858
It's perfect!

37:57.527 --> 38:00.405
Uh, are you sure
she's not luring you into a trap?

38:11.040 --> 38:14.085
Oh! It's one of those...

38:14.169 --> 38:15.962
Things we shouldn't be doing?

38:16.045 --> 38:17.839
It's a snowmaker!

38:17.922 --> 38:20.884
It makes snow!

38:21.176 --> 38:24.762
Yep, this is your ticket
to the warm side of Pixie Hollow.

38:25.054 --> 38:26.306
- Wait a second.

38:26.389 --> 38:29.184
This is crazy!
You don't even know if this thing works!

38:29.267 --> 38:31.102
Oh, it works, all right.

38:31.186 --> 38:33.229
Aye, we made it ourselves.

38:34.063 --> 38:36.733
Of course you did. Just walk away.

38:37.901 --> 38:39.319
How does it work?

38:39.402 --> 38:40.487
Guys?

38:40.570 --> 38:42.447
Pull.

38:42.614 --> 38:44.407
Move this around here.

38:48.286 --> 38:50.497
You might want to
step aside for this part.

38:52.999 --> 38:54.751
Ha! They're serious.

39:12.268 --> 39:14.103
Snow!

39:14.437 --> 39:15.522
Wow.

39:16.481 --> 39:18.775
You did it! You actually did it!

39:22.779 --> 39:24.280
Ooh! It's cold.

39:25.990 --> 39:27.116
So?

39:29.327 --> 39:30.328
Hmm.

39:30.828 --> 39:32.038
Go, go on.

39:32.455 --> 39:33.790
Live it, man.

39:40.463 --> 39:41.464
Whoa!

39:44.384 --> 39:46.177
Welcome, Miss Winkle.

39:46.261 --> 39:47.387
Thank you.

39:47.470 --> 39:51.224
All righty! Your tour begins
with the Autumn Forest.

39:51.307 --> 39:54.519
Next it's a quick stop
in Springtime Square.

39:54.602 --> 39:56.980
And finally, the Pixie Dust Tree,

39:57.272 --> 39:59.899
which, as you know,
makes all fairy life possible.

39:59.983 --> 40:04.070
Aye, that's where you'll be meeting
her majestiness, the queen.

40:04.487 --> 40:05.488
The queen?

40:06.114 --> 40:07.782
They're going to see the queen!

40:07.865 --> 40:09.284
She's very Wise.

40:09.367 --> 40:11.244
And if we tell her we're sisters,

40:11.327 --> 40:13.246
she'll change Lord Milori's rule.

40:13.329 --> 40:14.831
That is so exciting!

40:14.914 --> 40:17.959
Say hi for me, or curtsy,
or whatever it is you do.

40:18.126 --> 40:20.628
- Sure.
- And bring me back an acorn. A big one!

40:20.712 --> 40:22.255
- After you.
- Thank you.

40:23.715 --> 40:24.882
Bye!

40:26.801 --> 40:28.469
I can't believe
I'm going to get an acorn!

40:28.553 --> 40:30.471
Finally! That is so exciting!

40:36.769 --> 40:38.021
WOW.

40:42.859 --> 40:47.322
<i>♪ Just when
we thought life couldn't get much better.</i>

40:49.532 --> 40:54.829
<i>♪ A wish we never knew
we made came true.</i>

40:56.039 --> 40:59.208
<i>♪ Worlds that were apart
have come together.</i>

40:59.292 --> 41:01.294
- There she is!
- She's so wintery.

41:01.377 --> 41:03.796
<i>♪ We'll be friends
no matter what the weather.</i>

41:03.880 --> 41:05.131
This is so exciting!

41:05.214 --> 41:06.466
Wait for the signal.

41:06.549 --> 41:12.555
<i>♪ Wait until you see the wondrous
things that we can do here with you.</i>

41:12.639 --> 41:15.099
That's it. Operation Periwinkle in effect.

41:17.727 --> 41:23.066
<i>♪ We're on your side.</i>

41:24.317 --> 41:28.404

<i>♪ Doesn't seem so wide</i>

41:45.880 --> 41:47.382
Butterﬂies!

41:50.551 --> 41:52.011
Surprise!

41:53.763 --> 41:55.390
Oh! Your friends did all this?

41:55.473 --> 41:57.183
They wanted to surprise you.

41:57.517 --> 42:01.396
Everyone, this is Periwinkle, my sister.

42:01.562 --> 42:02.605
This is so exciting.

42:02.772 --> 42:03.999
- Oh, wow!
- Can you believe it?

42:04.023 --> 42:07.860
Hello. It is nice to meet you.

42:07.944 --> 42:11.489
I am Rosetta. This is...

42:11.572 --> 42:14.534
She's a Winter Fairy.
She's not from the moon.

42:14.617 --> 42:17.870
Oh, right. I know, I know.
I'm just so excited!

42:17.954 --> 42:19.747
It's great to meet all of you.

42:19.831 --> 42:22.625
This is so remarkable!
You two are sisters!

42:22.875 --> 42:24.877
Yeah. A little fairy-to-fairy advice.

42:24.961 --> 42:28.297
Tink can be tricky
to get along with at times.

42:28.589 --> 42:30.174
Yeah. Look who's talking.

42:30.299 --> 42:32.343
We can't believe you're over here!

42:32.427 --> 42:34.178
So... Are you cold enough?

42:34.470 --> 42:36.305
Yeah. It's perfect.

42:37.056 --> 42:38.599
Oh!

42:38.725 --> 42:40.101
AW!

42:40.184 --> 42:42.103
Oh, I nearly forgot.

42:42.186 --> 42:47.066
This is for you.
It's called a periwinkle. Also.

42:47.358 --> 42:48.651
Thank you.

42:50.236 --> 42:52.155
I'll keep it forever.

42:56.367 --> 42:57.535
Look at that!

42:57.618 --> 42:58.703
It's frost.

42:58.786 --> 43:01.789
She and her friends practice
in the Frost Forest. You should see it!

43:01.873 --> 43:04.125
Oh, you should see Tink on ice skates.

43:04.208 --> 43:05.918
She's a natural.

43:06.002 --> 43:08.045
It's only because you had that lost thing.

43:08.212 --> 43:10.923
- Uh, she collects lost things, too?
- Yeah!

43:11.007 --> 43:12.425
You guys are so alike.

43:12.508 --> 43:13.509
I know.

43:13.593 --> 43:16.512
Even our wings are identical.
That's why they sparkled.

43:16.596 --> 43:17.823
- Let's show them.
- I don't feel so...

43:17.847 --> 43:19.182
Oh! Periwinkle!

43:19.265 --> 43:20.266
Is she all right?

43:20.349 --> 43:22.101
I think she's getting a little too hot.

43:22.185 --> 43:24.854
My wings, I can't feel them.

43:26.397 --> 43:28.191
I think they're too warm.

43:28.441 --> 43:29.859
Oh, the snowmaker!

43:30.193 --> 43:32.028
It's running out of ice!

43:32.111 --> 43:33.780
We have to get her back to the border!

43:33.863 --> 43:35.823
Tink, what about the queen?

43:35.907 --> 43:37.200
There's no time.

43:37.283 --> 43:39.911
Clank, grab some ice.
We'll wrap her wings.

43:41.537 --> 43:43.956
Be careful. Gentle. Easy.

43:44.332 --> 43:46.375
Okay. Let's go. Hurry!

43:47.627 --> 43:49.003
All together. All together.

43:49.086 --> 43:50.421
All together.

43:50.505 --> 43:51.798
Hurry!

43:52.715 --> 43:53.883
We can do this!

43:56.469 --> 43:57.637
Hurry!

43:57.845 --> 43:59.347
Go, go, go!

43:59.764 --> 44:01.808
Hold on. We're almost there.

44:01.891 --> 44:03.684
Hurry! It's nearly out of ice!

44:03.768 --> 44:05.102
Not much further.

44:09.148 --> 44:10.817
Don't worry. We're almost there.

44:10.900 --> 44:13.236
We're going to make it.
We're going to make it!

44:15.738 --> 44:16.948
Let me help you.

44:19.200 --> 44:22.537
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

44:26.582 --> 44:28.793
Please, can you help her?

44:32.171 --> 44:33.172
Tink.

44:41.848 --> 44:46.727
Gently. Lift your wings.
Let the cold surround them.

45:02.952 --> 45:05.872
You're okay. Your wings are okay.

45:05.955 --> 45:07.665
Yeah. Yeah.

45:08.291 --> 45:10.626
This is why we do not cross the border.

45:11.878 --> 45:16.215
No, it could've worked!
We just needed a bigger piece of ice!

45:16.299 --> 45:19.719
And when that was gone?
Your wings could have broken.

45:20.887 --> 45:26.225
But they didn't. I'm fine. Thanks to them.

45:29.312 --> 45:32.481
The rule is there to protect you.
I'm sorry.

45:32.773 --> 45:35.234
You two may never see
each other again.

45:35.318 --> 45:37.653
Oh, please don't do this.
We belong together.

45:37.737 --> 45:39.155
We're sisters.

45:41.407 --> 45:43.326
We were born of the same laugh.

45:48.581 --> 45:51.542
All the more reason you should want
to keep each other safe.

45:52.585 --> 45:53.961
Return home.

45:58.674 --> 46:00.843
Come on, Tink. Let's go home.

46:00.927 --> 46:02.136
No!

46:03.888 --> 46:07.725
Lord Milori,
your rule will not keep us apart.

46:07.808 --> 46:08.893
Tinker Bell.

46:10.311 --> 46:13.940
This is not Lord Milori's rule. It's mine.

46:14.565 --> 46:15.942
Queen Clarion?

46:16.692 --> 46:17.902
I'm sorry.

46:25.952 --> 46:28.162
You should get deeper into the cold.

46:28.245 --> 46:30.456
Back to the north side of the mountain.

48:08.596 --> 48:11.640
Speaking of sparkling,
we can conclude

48:11.724 --> 48:17.313
that it spreads in a spiral
and circles the center.

48:18.439 --> 48:19.523
Oh!

48:31.368 --> 48:32.620
Hello?

48:33.662 --> 48:34.914
Hello?

48:41.670 --> 48:42.671
Peri?

48:53.766 --> 48:56.936
Queen Clarion. Why?

48:58.646 --> 48:59.647
Tinker Bell.

49:00.356 --> 49:03.859
Long ago,
when Pixie Hollow was very young,

49:04.735 --> 49:07.196
two fairies met and fell in love.

49:08.906 --> 49:10.658
One of them was a Winter Fairy...

49:11.325 --> 49:14.036
and the other
was from the warm seasons.

49:15.037 --> 49:17.665
The two fairies were enchanted
with each other.

49:17.748 --> 49:20.543
And every sunset,
they met at the border...

49:20.751 --> 49:22.753
where Spring touches Winter.

49:23.587 --> 49:27.758
But as their love grew stronger,
they wished to be together...

49:28.050 --> 49:30.386
and share each other's worlds.

49:32.555 --> 49:34.807
So they disregarded the danger
and crossed.

49:36.851 --> 49:38.269
One of them broke a wing.

49:40.771 --> 49:42.690
For which there is no cure.

49:43.941 --> 49:46.068
From that day forward,
Queen Clarion decreed

49:46.152 --> 49:48.654
that fairies must never again
cross the border.

49:49.446 --> 49:52.283
And I agreed that our two worlds

49:53.033 --> 49:55.244
should forever remain apart.

49:56.745 --> 49:58.914
And the two fairies?

49:59.748 --> 50:01.250
What happened to them?

50:04.545 --> 50:06.672
They had to say goodbye.

50:29.987 --> 50:31.071
We saw the snow.

50:31.155 --> 50:32.865
Queen Clarion, something's wrong!

50:32.948 --> 50:34.783
The temperature,
it seems to be plummeting!

50:34.867 --> 50:36.619
The hibiscus are halfway to hibernation!

50:36.702 --> 50:38.996
Now, now, ministers, let's not panic.

50:39.079 --> 50:40.247
Absolutely right.

50:40.331 --> 50:41.749
Snow!

50:43.042 --> 50:44.043
Heave!

50:44.126 --> 50:45.127
Ho!

50:45.211 --> 50:47.171
- Heave!
- Ho!

50:47.338 --> 50:48.839
Put your muscle into it, Clanky!

50:48.923 --> 50:50.382
I'm trying, Bobble!

50:51.342 --> 50:53.552
What happened? How did this get here?

50:53.636 --> 50:56.764
We don't know, Miss Bell,
but it's stuck real good!

50:56.847 --> 50:59.767
Aye, and it's making that thing bigger
by the minute!

51:02.186 --> 51:03.646
Guys, down here!

51:03.729 --> 51:04.730
- Come on!
- Got it!

51:04.813 --> 51:05.981
Okay, push!

51:08.025 --> 51:09.985
All together. All together!

51:11.403 --> 51:13.530
Upsy-daisy.

51:15.783 --> 51:17.076
We did it!

51:17.159 --> 51:18.953
- We did it!

51:19.036 --> 51:20.162
It's over.

51:20.246 --> 51:22.289
Uh, I don't think it is.

51:24.750 --> 51:26.126
Oh, my goodness.

51:26.669 --> 51:28.837
The seasons have
been thrown out of balance.

51:28.921 --> 51:29.964
But if the temperatures

51:30.047 --> 51:32.633
continue to drop,
it will freeze all of Pixie Hollow.

51:35.678 --> 51:38.847
- Oh, no.
- Queen Clarion, the Pixie Dust Tree.

51:40.849 --> 51:42.935
We must hope
the tree survives the freeze.

51:43.519 --> 51:45.854
Otherwise there will
be no more pixie dust.

51:46.897 --> 51:49.817
Life in Pixie Hollow will change forever.

51:49.900 --> 51:52.444
And no fairy will ever fly again.

51:53.320 --> 51:56.115
Hurry. We must do everything we can.

51:57.700 --> 52:01.245
Grab as many as you can
and head for the Pixie Dust Tree!

52:01.412 --> 52:05.082
Hurry, guys! This way!
Hop to it! That's it!

52:11.130 --> 52:12.506
Snug as a bug.

52:12.756 --> 52:14.633
Oh, no!

52:22.516 --> 52:24.268
Come on, that's it.

52:25.185 --> 52:26.603
Just a little faster.

52:26.687 --> 52:27.938
That's it, fairies.

52:28.063 --> 52:31.734
Lay the blankets along the branches,
as many as you can!

52:32.026 --> 52:34.570
We must protect the Pixie Dust Tree!

52:34.987 --> 52:36.989
- Miss Bell!
- Tink! Do you need any help?

52:37.072 --> 52:39.158
No! This is my last run!

52:39.450 --> 52:41.035
I'll meet you in the tree!

52:48.917 --> 52:50.419
Everybody okay?

52:51.628 --> 52:55.341
Great. There you go. Nice and toasty.

52:55.591 --> 52:57.634
You guys just stay here and keep warm.

52:57.760 --> 53:01.597
Everything's going to be fine.

53:07.770 --> 53:09.271
It's still alive.

53:14.651 --> 53:15.986
Peri.

53:17.196 --> 53:18.697
Dewey, you've got to see this.

53:18.781 --> 53:20.925
There must be something wrong
with the Pixie Dust Tree.

53:20.949 --> 53:22.034
- Now don't worry...

53:22.117 --> 53:23.535
- Whoa!

53:23.619 --> 53:24.620
Careful.

53:24.703 --> 53:27.122
I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.

53:27.247 --> 53:28.248
Oh!

53:30.584 --> 53:31.710
Oh, dear.

53:41.136 --> 53:46.266
Okay, you might want to worry
just a little bit.

53:49.395 --> 53:50.437
Tink?

53:52.356 --> 53:53.732
Periwinkle!

54:12.918 --> 54:16.046
Tinker Bell! Are you okay?

54:16.755 --> 54:18.257
Why would you fly here?

54:18.340 --> 54:19.425
I had to.

54:19.508 --> 54:21.427
Your jacket. Put on your jacket.

54:21.510 --> 54:23.053
Pixie Hollow's in trouble.

54:23.137 --> 54:25.931
There's a freeze moving in,
and the Pixie Dust Tree is in danger.

54:26.014 --> 54:27.850
Oh, that explains it.

54:28.350 --> 54:31.270
The pixie dust here,
it already stopped flowing.

54:31.603 --> 54:33.605
I think there's something you can do.

54:34.022 --> 54:36.900
Your frost, it kept the flower alive.

54:37.109 --> 54:40.112
Oh! Oh! Oh! Frost does that.
It's like a little blanket.

54:40.195 --> 54:42.698
It tucks the warm air inside
and keeps out the cold.

54:45.868 --> 54:48.996
We could frost the Pixie Dust Tree
before the freeze hits it.

54:49.705 --> 54:52.458
Uh, one question.
What about our wings?

54:52.541 --> 54:55.544
If it's a freeze,
it will be cold enough to cross.

54:56.962 --> 54:58.505
Then what are we waiting for?

55:04.970 --> 55:06.555
We're almost to the border!

55:13.353 --> 55:14.605
The Autumn Woods.

55:17.649 --> 55:20.319
The freeze.
It's moving so fast.

55:21.069 --> 55:22.509
Come on! We have to get to the tree!

55:38.962 --> 55:40.339
That's it, Clanky.

55:42.257 --> 55:44.927
Queen Clarion, it's not working.

55:45.010 --> 55:46.637
The wind, it's too strong!

55:52.851 --> 55:54.061
Tinker Bell.

55:54.144 --> 55:56.355
Queen Clarion! They can help.

55:56.438 --> 56:00.442
Our frost, it covers like a blanket.
It can protect the tree.

56:06.073 --> 56:07.115
Do it.

56:29.638 --> 56:30.639
Oh, no.

56:30.722 --> 56:32.057
It's getting colder.

56:32.140 --> 56:34.643
Let's hand out the blankets.
They'll keep us warm!

56:34.726 --> 56:36.728
Hurry, Peri. Hurry!

56:47.322 --> 56:50.075
That's it. There you go!
Make sure to cover your wings!

56:50.158 --> 56:53.912
The tree! It's too big.
We're never going to make it.

56:57.332 --> 56:58.584
I'm sorry.

57:20.814 --> 57:21.815
Whoopsie! Ha!

57:27.904 --> 57:29.072
Lord Milori.

57:29.156 --> 57:30.449
We've come to help.

57:30.532 --> 57:32.135
Now, you didn't think
I was going to let you

57:32.159 --> 57:34.328
do this all by yourself, now did you?

57:35.954 --> 57:37.956
The tree should be our top priority.

57:38.040 --> 57:41.376
But any fairy we can spare
should try to frost the other seasons.

57:42.669 --> 57:45.714
Start at the freeze line
and spread out to Spring and Summer.

57:45.797 --> 57:47.633
The rest of you, cover the tree!

57:55.474 --> 57:57.142
Oh, my goodness.

57:57.225 --> 57:59.645
Look, Bobble! The snowy owls!

57:59.728 --> 58:00.729
Ah!

58:05.317 --> 58:06.526
Thank you.

58:06.610 --> 58:07.986
Stay warm.

58:08.612 --> 58:09.613
Oh!

58:14.993 --> 58:16.036
Now!

58:44.606 --> 58:48.026
We've done all we can. Join the others.

58:59.287 --> 59:02.624
The freeze is upon us.
You must take cover.

59:02.708 --> 59:03.709
Follow me.

59:06.044 --> 59:07.629
Oh, I hope it works.

59:08.422 --> 59:09.423
Tink!

59:19.808 --> 59:21.435
Will everything be all right?

59:21.518 --> 59:24.646
I don't know.
I've never seen anything like this.

59:31.069 --> 59:32.487
Thank you, Milori.

59:32.654 --> 59:34.197
Please, take cover.

59:41.663 --> 59:45.000
Winter Fairies, stand guard.

01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:40.240
What a beautiful sight.

01:01:48.081 --> 01:01:51.209
It worked! It worked, Tinker Bell.

01:01:51.459 --> 01:01:52.919
Oh, thank goodness!

01:01:58.300 --> 01:01:59.342
We did it.

01:02:08.435 --> 01:02:09.519
Whoa!

01:02:12.772 --> 01:02:13.773
Oh!

01:02:23.909 --> 01:02:25.243
Come on, everyone!

01:02:28.455 --> 01:02:29.831
Tink! Come on!

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:33.668
Tink?

01:02:34.461 --> 01:02:36.630
What's wrong?

01:02:45.722 --> 01:02:46.848
Oh!

01:02:50.310 --> 01:02:53.855
When you flew to Winter,
that's why you fell.

01:02:56.691 --> 01:02:57.943
Oh, no.

01:02:58.026 --> 01:02:59.444
Oh, Tinker Bell.

01:02:59.527 --> 01:03:00.612
Tink.

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:03.865
Why didn't you tell me?

01:03:05.116 --> 01:03:06.785
We had to save the tree.

01:03:08.036 --> 01:03:11.331
Besides, there's no cure
for a broken wing.

01:03:13.166 --> 01:03:14.876
I'm so sorry.

01:03:26.888 --> 01:03:29.724
This happened
because we tried to keep you apart.

01:03:31.059 --> 01:03:32.394
But never again.

01:03:33.228 --> 01:03:34.562
You belong together.

01:03:45.281 --> 01:03:46.574
It's getting warmer.

01:03:47.158 --> 01:03:48.743
You should get back to Winter.

01:03:51.204 --> 01:03:52.205
Yeah.

01:03:58.253 --> 01:04:01.506
I'll be okay.
I'll meet you tomorrow at the border.

01:04:06.428 --> 01:04:07.554
Sisters?

01:04:08.513 --> 01:04:09.597
Sisters.

01:04:19.899 --> 01:04:20.900
Jingles!

01:05:02.317 --> 01:05:03.318
Uh... Eh...

01:05:03.443 --> 01:05:04.778
That's a new chapter.

01:05:09.407 --> 01:05:11.451
Okay, that was amazing.

01:05:11.534 --> 01:05:13.578
Miss Bell, you are fantastic!

01:05:18.249 --> 01:05:20.877
Oh! Queen Clarion!

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:24.005
I didn't know they were going to do
the smoochy, smoochity.

01:05:24.089 --> 01:05:25.590
Guess they're telling people now.

01:05:42.857 --> 01:05:43.858
Next!

01:05:47.529 --> 01:05:49.697
Uh, maybe you should go first.

01:05:50.698 --> 01:05:52.659
Next.

01:05:52.742 --> 01:05:54.160
Ugh! All right.

01:05:56.538 --> 01:05:58.331
Ooh! Would you look at that.

01:05:59.874 --> 01:06:00.875
Oh!

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.001
Ooh!

01:06:02.085 --> 01:06:03.545
That feels good.

01:06:13.388 --> 01:06:15.223
Look out! Runaway bunny!

01:06:22.063 --> 01:06:23.648
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:25.275
Hey, little buddy.

01:06:26.568 --> 01:06:28.153
From Dewey?

01:06:28.236 --> 01:06:30.488
It's what my friends call me.

01:06:31.322 --> 01:06:33.366
Wow!

01:06:35.577 --> 01:06:37.577
I love your work.
I have so many questions for you.

01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:39.747
Okay, you can let go of my hand now.

01:06:44.544 --> 01:06:45.753
- Hi.

01:06:46.254 --> 01:06:47.338
Hello there.

01:06:47.422 --> 01:06:50.216
- I'm Sled.
- Oh, my. That's perfect! Oh!

01:06:52.635 --> 01:06:53.970
I'm Rosetta.

01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:56.681
Rosetta. That's beautiful.

01:06:57.932 --> 01:06:59.893
Oh, my.

01:07:00.768 --> 01:07:02.937
Oh, Miss Gliss!

01:07:03.271 --> 01:07:04.522
An acorn!

01:07:04.689 --> 01:07:06.691
Biggest one we could find.

01:07:06.774 --> 01:07:07.775
I love it!

01:07:07.859 --> 01:07:08.943
She likes acorns.

01:07:09.027 --> 01:07:10.111
Must be a Winter thing.

01:07:10.195 --> 01:07:11.237
Not really.

01:07:12.447 --> 01:07:13.448
Tink.

01:07:14.949 --> 01:07:16.201
You ready?

01:07:16.284 --> 01:07:17.285
Ready.

01:07:28.671 --> 01:07:29.672
Ooh!

01:07:31.966 --> 01:07:33.218
Lovely!

01:07:35.762 --> 01:07:40.141

01:07:42.477 --> 01:07:47.315
