00:11.145 --> 00:13.881
(traffic whirs)

00:13.881 --> 00:16.550
(ominous music)

00:21.055 --> 00:23.557
(birds chirp)

00:51.685 --> 00:54.388
(intense music)

01:07.735 --> 01:09.170
- Feel that burn.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.504
It's right here.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.373
You only got two
more of these. Okay?

01:13.241 --> 01:14.074
Two.

01:15.776 --> 01:18.078
And one.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.248
Great job, you guys.

01:20.248 --> 01:23.717
Okay. So take two
and grab a drink.

01:26.019 --> 01:30.691
(alarm buzzes)
(scoffs)

01:33.594 --> 01:38.566
* Slow down you're
not going anywhere *

01:38.566 --> 01:39.733
* Slow down

01:39.733 --> 01:41.769
Jeez, I'm sorry, guys.

01:41.769 --> 01:44.205
I don't know what's going
on with my internet.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.874
(intense music)

01:59.453 --> 02:01.822
(soft music)

02:23.311 --> 02:24.412
- Record.

02:24.412 --> 02:26.580
(camera beeps)

02:26.614 --> 02:28.949
Hi, I'm Alexandria.

02:28.982 --> 02:32.119
I'm a very hardworking and
dedicated employee of KNG.

02:32.119 --> 02:33.954
And this is my bestie, Jo.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.256
Also an employee of KNG.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.490
Slightly lower work standards,

02:36.490 --> 02:38.659
but still a great gal overall.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.828
- No.
(chuckles)

02:40.828 --> 02:42.596
- So did Garrett
put the technology

02:42.630 --> 02:43.797
for this together himself

02:43.831 --> 02:46.434
or did he have
his minions do it?

02:46.434 --> 02:48.001
- Oh, he's got a
whole tech department,

02:48.001 --> 02:49.370
so he probably didn't
personally do it.

02:49.437 --> 02:50.838
(clears throat)

02:50.838 --> 02:51.672
- And that's my cue.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.040
I'll see you at lunch.

02:53.106 --> 02:54.775
(employees chattering)

02:54.808 --> 02:57.945
(bright guitar music)

03:02.283 --> 03:04.452
(group chattering)

03:04.452 --> 03:06.787
- So this one can sense
someone's movement

03:06.787 --> 03:08.489
from that far away?

03:08.522 --> 03:11.124
- Indeed, it bounces
wifi radio waves

03:11.124 --> 03:12.560
off of people's
bodies to measure

03:12.560 --> 03:14.795
their heart rate among
other biometrics.

03:14.828 --> 03:17.798
So then matches that to
a likely mood profile.

03:19.867 --> 03:23.671
- You guys are doing some
crazy things with technology.

03:25.373 --> 03:28.676
- Well, you gotta be a
little crazy to stay ahead.

03:32.313 --> 03:35.416
- So I am about this close

03:35.416 --> 03:38.085
to sending my application
to shefit.com.

03:40.388 --> 03:43.391
Remember, it's the
online blogging position

03:43.391 --> 03:45.393
with a fitness company.

03:45.393 --> 03:48.228
Yeah, so I've been
uploading new content,

03:48.228 --> 03:50.731
trying to show versatility
that I'm not, you know,

03:50.764 --> 03:52.099
just a fitness instructor,

03:52.099 --> 03:54.502
but I actually can give
insightful reviews.

03:56.404 --> 03:58.572
I mean, I think my
stuff's been pretty good.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.208
- Yeah, your stuff is great.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.445
I just don't know why
you need to be messing

04:04.445 --> 04:05.613
with that right now.

04:05.613 --> 04:06.847
Especially when you're
gaining momentum

04:06.880 --> 04:09.216
with your online
courses, you know?

04:09.216 --> 04:11.051
Why not wait till you
have a bigger following?

04:12.019 --> 04:13.220
- Whenever you're ready.

04:13.253 --> 04:16.290
(upbeat rock music)

04:16.290 --> 04:17.625
So this is gonna be like...

04:17.691 --> 04:21.094
(music drowns out voice)

04:28.869 --> 04:30.538
- [Alexandria] Oh, nice.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.072
- [Jo] You can see she has
really consistent brand.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.273
- [Alexandria] Yep.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.442
- I'm gonna to
message her and see

04:34.475 --> 04:35.876
if she'd be willing
to meet with me.

04:35.909 --> 04:37.044
Give me some tips.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.479
Oh, I almost forgot.

04:38.479 --> 04:39.980
I have a Skype meeting
with Miss Avery.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.149
It's a big door opener
lady Ruth told me about,

04:42.149 --> 04:43.317
so I need you...

04:43.317 --> 04:46.620
(upbeat rock music)

04:46.620 --> 04:47.955
Uh, uh, uh!

04:47.988 --> 04:49.056
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:52.760 --> 04:57.297
* We'll make you dinner first

04:57.297 --> 04:59.800
(sighs)

04:59.800 --> 05:02.302
(tablet rings)

05:06.474 --> 05:07.307
- This is Miss Avery.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.776
- Hi, Miss Avery.

05:08.776 --> 05:11.111
I'm Jo Kelly. I'm a personal
trainer here in Denver.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.280
And Ruth had said
that you were looking

05:13.280 --> 05:15.115
for a new personal
trainer to assist you

05:15.148 --> 05:16.149
with your fitness goals.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.451
- Yes.

05:17.485 --> 05:18.952
Ruth mentioned that
she was following

05:18.952 --> 05:20.954
a brilliant online
fitness instructor.

05:20.954 --> 05:23.290
I thought that we
should have a chat.

05:23.290 --> 05:25.493
Tell me you name
again. Joan, was it?

05:25.493 --> 05:27.795
- It's Jo, short for Joanna.

05:27.828 --> 05:28.829
- Okay. Joanna.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.097
Your school, tell me about that.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.635
- Well, I had taken some
exercise science courses

05:34.635 --> 05:36.203
at the community college.

05:36.203 --> 05:37.671
- I see.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.106
Where did you receive
your certification

05:39.139 --> 05:42.009
to become a personal trainer?

05:42.009 --> 05:45.112
- I received my certification
through okayfitness.org.

05:45.145 --> 05:46.814
- Just Okay?

05:48.048 --> 05:49.383
Great.

05:49.383 --> 05:52.219
Do you have any
expertise in Pilates?

05:52.219 --> 05:54.555
Post-injury and recovery?

05:54.622 --> 05:56.657
I had surgery on my
shoulder recently

05:56.690 --> 05:59.693
and I must take care
not to reinjure myself.

06:00.794 --> 06:03.497
- [Jo] So after
cutting me off again,

06:03.531 --> 06:06.066
she said have a
nice day, Joanna.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.203
- Oh.
- Oh, this is beautiful.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.974
Here, let's make a
little video for my page.

06:15.409 --> 06:17.344
(bag unzippers)

06:17.377 --> 06:18.211
Here we go.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.218
Record.

06:27.688 --> 06:28.522
Record.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.224
- Let me look at it.
- Oh.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.560
It was working earlier.

06:34.261 --> 06:35.062
- Record.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.568
Record.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.571
All ready said
the voice command.

06:43.571 --> 06:44.672
Piece of crap.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.740
(camera beeps)

06:46.740 --> 06:48.876
Hey, at least the video
feature's working.

06:48.909 --> 06:49.743
- Really?

06:51.178 --> 06:52.245
- I'll fix it for you.

06:53.380 --> 06:54.247
It's funny, right?

06:59.252 --> 07:00.420
- Piece of crap.

07:00.420 --> 07:05.392
(ominous music)
(camera beeps)

07:19.206 --> 07:20.040
- Here you go.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.109
Order whatever.

07:23.310 --> 07:24.745
I'm gonna jump in the shower.

07:29.617 --> 07:30.884
- 25 minutes is great.

07:32.219 --> 07:33.120
Thanks. Bye.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.793
- [Man] Hello, Jo.
How's my girl doing?

07:39.793 --> 07:41.261
I'm just checking in.
(shower sprays)

07:41.294 --> 07:44.397
I'm on my way over to the
lodge for a few beers.

07:44.397 --> 07:45.733
Hey, you know, I was wondering,

07:45.766 --> 07:47.935
when are you gonna bring
Garrett around again?

07:47.935 --> 07:50.604
I've met him, what, twice?

07:50.638 --> 07:53.173
Well, anyway, hope you decided

07:53.173 --> 07:55.676
to send in that
fitness application.

07:55.743 --> 07:58.979
I know you were saying
the deadline was today.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.582
(soft music)
(shower sprays)

08:01.615 --> 08:03.617
(sighs)

08:15.162 --> 08:17.998
- Sorry, Garrett.
It's not biggie.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.672
(papers rustle)

08:27.374 --> 08:32.379
(keyboard clatters)
(shower sprays)

09:01.008 --> 09:06.013
(ominous music)
(shower sprays)

09:15.656 --> 09:19.059
(shower curtain scrapes)

09:21.829 --> 09:23.831
(sighs)

09:31.605 --> 09:34.107
(keys jangle)

09:40.614 --> 09:43.617
(camera clicks)

09:43.684 --> 09:46.386
(phone vibrates)

09:55.528 --> 09:58.531
(melancholy music)

10:02.870 --> 10:03.704
- Stop.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.941
- All right, just seeing
if you're paying attention.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.078
- I only had one beer.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.612
Yes. I'm paying attention.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.814
Stop cheating.

10:14.882 --> 10:16.216
- All right. All right.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.217
Let me see here.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.424
- I don't think so.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.459
Not tonight, sucker.

10:27.594 --> 10:29.262
- That's my girl.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.131
I like seeing that fight in you,

10:32.332 --> 10:36.303
you need more of that
attitude in your life.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.138
* But you don't care

10:38.171 --> 10:40.841
(phone vibrates)

10:43.677 --> 10:46.179
(bright music)

11:18.145 --> 11:21.114
(keys jangle)

11:21.114 --> 11:23.050
- I'm here.
- Oh, hey.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.517
- What's up?

11:24.517 --> 11:26.186
- Oh, come inside.

11:26.219 --> 11:28.155
I'll tell you.
- Baby girl.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.522
What's going on?

11:29.522 --> 11:32.492
(bright music)

11:32.525 --> 11:35.295
My man used to cheat
on me all the time.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.696
(chuckles)

11:36.696 --> 11:39.032
He's locked up now, so I
don't have to worry about it,

11:40.533 --> 11:42.702
Honey, he doesn't deserve you.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.038
- Thank you.

11:46.239 --> 11:47.741
Well, people keep
telling me that

11:47.741 --> 11:50.677
it's just hard connecting
it from here to here.

11:50.710 --> 11:54.547
And he hasn't even said
a word to me since, so.

11:54.547 --> 11:59.419
- (scoffs) Look, I don't
care what he looks like

11:59.419 --> 12:01.922
or what kind of
fancy car he drives,

12:01.922 --> 12:05.993
but a man like that
will only drag you down

12:06.026 --> 12:07.694
and you can't have that

12:07.727 --> 12:09.396
'cause you're going
places, honey.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.399
For real.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.167
Oh!

12:16.837 --> 12:19.506
- Did I ever tell you that you

12:19.539 --> 12:20.874
were my favorite client?

12:20.874 --> 12:22.575
- Oh yeah.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.912
Only when I'm sticking
to my eating plan.

12:24.912 --> 12:25.745
(laughs)

12:25.745 --> 12:28.415
(bright music)

12:45.232 --> 12:46.133
- All right, guys.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.467
So for this next workout,

12:47.534 --> 12:50.437
I want you to lie down
on your mats like this,

12:50.437 --> 12:53.306
have your legs open,
comfortable distance apart,

12:53.373 --> 12:54.774
arms out and hand straight.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.777
What I want you to do
is to pull yourself up

12:57.777 --> 12:59.212
using those core muscles.

12:59.246 --> 13:00.713
We're going to
come to about here.

13:00.713 --> 13:04.751
And then slowly bring
yourself back down. Okay?

13:04.784 --> 13:06.386
I'm just going to do
10 of these, all right?

13:06.386 --> 13:07.220
Let's go.

13:08.321 --> 13:09.156
One,

13:10.457 --> 13:11.925
two,
(message beeps)

13:11.959 --> 13:14.627
If you're commenting. I know
you're not working out, Calvin.

13:15.829 --> 13:18.565
(message beeps)

13:19.799 --> 13:21.434
Nine,

13:21.468 --> 13:22.635
and 10.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.637
Okay. So 30 second break.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.640
And then we're gonna
go at it again.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.680
(ominous music)

13:33.746 --> 13:36.483
(message beeps)

13:41.154 --> 13:42.355
Wow.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.091
I'm sorry you guys
had to see that.

13:44.091 --> 13:47.760
I don't know who that person
was, but they are blocked.

13:47.760 --> 13:48.962
Yay.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.363
Okay, we're gonna
go at it again.

13:50.363 --> 13:55.368
(suspenseful music)
(message beeps)

15:00.667 --> 15:01.834
- Jo.
- Oh, hi.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.272
- Hey, it's so nice to meet you.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.607
- Oh, thank you for taking
time out of your schedule

15:07.674 --> 15:09.342
to meet with me.
- Yeah.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.544
So do you ever work
out at the park?

15:12.879 --> 15:14.214
- Mm.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.616
- You wanna post things
that keep them inspired

15:16.616 --> 15:17.450
to come back for more.

15:17.450 --> 15:20.120
(balls thud)

15:20.187 --> 15:22.522
Most girls post
themselves half naked,

15:23.690 --> 15:26.426
but I'd rather be
taken seriously.

15:27.594 --> 15:28.728
You know what they say.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.564
Only the strong survive.

15:32.599 --> 15:33.433
- Right.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.303
- And remember, you
have a lot more viewers

15:36.303 --> 15:38.805
than a lot of other
trainers out there.

15:38.805 --> 15:40.807
I like your content.

15:40.873 --> 15:44.311
Nowadays, I barely have time
to follow any fitness girls.

15:44.311 --> 15:45.812
- Thank you so much.

15:47.047 --> 15:49.082
It's just, it gets
so hard out there.

15:49.116 --> 15:51.618
You know, and some faceless
troll starts commenting

15:51.618 --> 15:55.122
on my looks or
randomly insulting me.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.256
- Right?

15:56.289 --> 15:58.591
With every post,
there's like five people

15:58.591 --> 16:01.261
that comment on my look, my form

16:01.294 --> 16:04.064
and the worst can actually
be other fit girls.

16:05.632 --> 16:08.601
Yeah, the fitness
world can get real ugly

16:08.635 --> 16:10.670
when it comes to competition.

16:10.670 --> 16:11.971
Everyone's doing what they feel

16:11.971 --> 16:13.573
they need to do to stay ahead.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.309
- Wow.

16:16.343 --> 16:18.678
I hadn't even
thought about that.

16:18.745 --> 16:21.581
- Well, you're lucky you
haven't run into that yet.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.083
Don't worry about it.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.752
Just know that it's
all a part of the game

16:25.752 --> 16:29.289
and when it does happen,
don't take it personal.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.993
(traffic whirs)

16:45.172 --> 16:48.175
(keyboard clatters)

16:50.843 --> 16:52.512
(ominous music)

16:52.512 --> 16:53.780
- What?

16:53.813 --> 16:54.647
No!

16:56.449 --> 16:58.385
(sighs)

16:58.385 --> 17:00.520
Class is not canceled.

17:00.520 --> 17:04.057
(keyboard clattering)

17:04.124 --> 17:05.225
(bottle clacks)

17:05.225 --> 17:06.559
Shoot.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.328
(gloves thud)

17:08.361 --> 17:10.197
- All right, and time.

17:10.197 --> 17:11.364
All right, let's partner up.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.233
Let's get on the
focus mitts, please.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.035
- That's just so creepy.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.537
(gloves thudding)

17:17.537 --> 17:18.838
Do you think it's Garrett?

17:20.307 --> 17:21.808
- It's crossed my mind.

17:22.742 --> 17:26.045
- I mean he's Mr. Techie Guy and

17:26.045 --> 17:27.647
he still didn't talk to you.

17:27.680 --> 17:28.681
That's weird.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.318
- Trust me.

17:31.351 --> 17:32.719
He wouldn't waste his time.

17:34.421 --> 17:35.255
- I don't know.

17:36.323 --> 17:37.190
Maybe it's random.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.261
It's not like you're the
type that has enemies.

17:41.328 --> 17:44.063
(ominous music)

18:02.549 --> 18:03.616
There was an email sent
when you were working

18:03.616 --> 18:04.751
out last night.

18:04.751 --> 18:05.918
- What?
- There's

18:05.952 --> 18:06.886
a picture of you.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.855
You're like half naked in it.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.690
I mean, I can tell it's
from a long time ago,

18:10.723 --> 18:14.227
but it was sent to everyone.

18:14.227 --> 18:15.895
- Pull it up. Show it to me.

18:15.895 --> 18:19.299
(ominous music)

18:19.299 --> 18:20.600
- Jo.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.536
Hmm, I need to see in my office.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.972
Please return to your desk.

18:25.972 --> 18:29.309
(employees chattering)

18:30.443 --> 18:32.545
You realize it was sent
to the whole branch?

18:34.080 --> 18:35.482
- Yes.

18:35.482 --> 18:39.152
- Is that photo saved
on your work computer?

18:39.152 --> 18:40.420
- No.

18:40.453 --> 18:43.990
No, I think it saved
on my personal laptop.

18:43.990 --> 18:46.793
I don't, I don't
know how they...

18:49.596 --> 18:52.765
Jason, I am truly sorry
that this happened.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.903
I don't, I don't know
what else to say.

19:01.174 --> 19:03.009
- I imagine it's
pretty embarrassing.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.680
Look, when you show up on time

19:07.680 --> 19:11.184
and you're not yakking with
Allie, you do good work.

19:11.184 --> 19:12.985
We just can't let
this happen again.

19:14.621 --> 19:17.524
I suggest whatever
this thing is.

19:17.524 --> 19:20.360
You figure it out because I
can't cover for you again.

19:20.427 --> 19:23.129
(intense music)

19:35.342 --> 19:36.543
- You know, for it's worth.

19:36.543 --> 19:37.610
I don't think you
really have anything

19:37.644 --> 19:38.811
to be embarrassed about.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.714
It was artistic.
- Brent.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.350
- Yeah.
- I'm sure you mean well,

19:43.350 --> 19:46.853
but could you just
not right now?

19:46.853 --> 19:48.154
- Yeah, sure.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.489
I get it.

19:49.489 --> 19:50.323
Sorry.

19:51.391 --> 19:54.227
(phone vibrates)

20:02.635 --> 20:06.239
- I don't even wanna know what
they said at that meeting.

20:06.239 --> 20:09.041
- Well, Jason was the
only one that talked.

20:09.041 --> 20:12.379
He explained to
everybody what happened.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.547
And he also said he didn't want
to hear anyone discussing it

20:14.547 --> 20:17.083
or it could be considered
sexual harassment.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.386
- Thank God he didn't fire.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.889
Well it's nice to
see he has a heart.

20:24.824 --> 20:27.427
Do you want me to go with
you to the police after work?

20:28.895 --> 20:30.397
- Police?

20:30.430 --> 20:31.764
- Yeah.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.433
- But what are they gonna do?

20:33.433 --> 20:36.936
- Jo, this person could
have cost you your job.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.671
You at least have
to file a report.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.375
This is getting scary.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.877
(soft music)

20:54.587 --> 20:56.356
- Hi, I'm Detective Joe Briggs.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.391
- I'm Jo Kelly.

20:58.391 --> 20:59.459
- Ooh, good name.

21:00.593 --> 21:01.794
How can I help you today?

21:03.095 --> 21:07.233
- Um, I'm being harassed online.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.439
It started, I guess,

21:12.439 --> 21:15.074
about a week ago
with a direct message

21:15.107 --> 21:17.410
and it wasn't like
a typical hacking

21:17.410 --> 21:19.746
where someone spams
all your friends.

21:19.746 --> 21:22.415
He was able to
somehow access photos

21:22.449 --> 21:25.552
that were only saved
on my personal laptop.

21:25.552 --> 21:26.953
- He, so this is a male?

21:26.953 --> 21:28.755
- Oh, I, I don't know.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.089
I don't know who it is.

21:31.458 --> 21:34.293
- Has there been any other
harassment that's taken place?

21:34.327 --> 21:35.828
- Yes.

21:35.828 --> 21:38.931
Today I got to work and
found out that this person

21:38.965 --> 21:42.301
sent out an email
from my work account,

21:42.301 --> 21:45.805
sending a photo of myself that
could have only been saved on

21:45.838 --> 21:50.810
my personal laptop to a large
majority of my coworkers.

21:51.744 --> 21:52.345
- Photo. What kind of photo?

21:54.180 --> 21:56.649
- The kind you don't
want your parents to see.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.586
Oh, and I'm sorry.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.087
My account was hacked again.

22:01.087 --> 22:03.756
This was before the work email,

22:03.790 --> 22:07.126
but after the direct
message, sorry.

22:07.159 --> 22:07.994
- That's all right.
- Forgot to mention that.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.496
- I'm tracking with you.

22:09.496 --> 22:11.263
Anything else happen?

22:11.297 --> 22:12.965
- No. I mean, that's it.

22:12.965 --> 22:15.668
I just, and when my
work email got hacked,

22:15.668 --> 22:17.203
I coulda got fired.

22:17.269 --> 22:18.104
- Yeah.

22:19.338 --> 22:22.509
Most of the time the
victim has a good idea

22:22.509 --> 22:24.944
as to who's doing
this and we are able

22:24.944 --> 22:29.048
to send a strong warning
before things get out of hand.

22:29.048 --> 22:31.684
So do you have any enemies?

22:34.821 --> 22:37.223
- I don't think so.

22:37.223 --> 22:39.291
I mean, I'm also
a personal trainer

22:39.325 --> 22:41.360
and I teach online
fitness classes

22:41.360 --> 22:45.197
and I can have well over
150 viewers at one time.

22:45.197 --> 22:49.502
So I mean, you can't take
a look at my computer

22:49.536 --> 22:50.670
and see where it came from?

22:50.670 --> 22:51.904
- I can't,

22:51.904 --> 22:53.540
and we don't have a
digital forensics unit

22:53.540 --> 22:54.907
here at the station.

22:54.974 --> 22:57.209
Unfortunately it
would take a lot more

22:57.209 --> 22:58.911
than what you just
told me to get the guys

22:58.978 --> 23:00.379
at the crime lab involved.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.915
(ominous music)

23:02.982 --> 23:05.752
Document and save everything.

23:05.752 --> 23:07.319
I'm hoping things don't
get worse for you,

23:07.353 --> 23:09.589
but if they do we'll
need everything

23:09.589 --> 23:11.323
we can get to pin
this person down.

23:12.324 --> 23:13.593
- Okay.

23:13.593 --> 23:14.861
Thank you for your time.

23:14.894 --> 23:15.728
- Mm-hmm.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.433
- Hey, Jo.

23:20.500 --> 23:23.102
Nine times out of 10,
it's someone you know.

23:23.102 --> 23:25.872
(ominous music)

24:54.961 --> 24:57.296
- Yes, I would love to try some

24:57.296 --> 24:59.465
of your new tapioca de ranches.

25:01.167 --> 25:04.170
Well, I got class tonight
but tomorrow's totally open.

25:05.638 --> 25:08.307
And guess who got an interview
for that blogging position?

25:08.340 --> 25:13.345
(traffic whirs)
(ominous music)

25:13.946 --> 25:17.283
(doorbell rings)

25:17.316 --> 25:18.651
- You look gorgeous.

25:18.651 --> 25:19.986
- Oh!

25:19.986 --> 25:21.721
You have the wrong house.

25:21.721 --> 25:22.955
- Don't be silly, Jo.

25:22.989 --> 25:24.023
- Uh. (scoffs)

25:24.023 --> 25:25.124
(dramatic music)

25:25.157 --> 25:26.693
Do I know you?

25:26.693 --> 25:29.696
- I'm Scott, you're Jo.

25:29.729 --> 25:30.997
I booked a day with you.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.699
You accepted.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.667
I'm here to come
inside or take you out.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.302
(dramatic music)

25:36.302 --> 25:37.536
Don't be like that.

25:39.471 --> 25:41.641
(knee whacks)
(groans)

25:41.674 --> 25:42.508
(lock clacks)

25:42.508 --> 25:43.643
(dramatic music)

25:43.643 --> 25:44.677
- Get the hell out of here

25:44.711 --> 25:46.212
before I call the police.

25:48.314 --> 25:51.483
- Listen, it's
complicated process.

25:51.483 --> 25:53.319
All right, you want
me to go pick up a guy

25:53.352 --> 25:55.988
that I don't even have a
vehicle description for

25:55.988 --> 25:57.256
and charge them with what?

25:58.858 --> 26:00.993
I know the system, Jo.

26:00.993 --> 26:02.528
Yeah, I could throw them
in jail for a night.

26:02.561 --> 26:05.431
Then he lawyers up, he points
right back to that escort site

26:05.431 --> 26:07.433
that you have your profile on.

26:07.433 --> 26:09.902
- I didn't make that profile.

26:12.905 --> 26:16.042
You had said something
about forensics.

26:16.075 --> 26:18.544
I mean, how severe
do things need to be

26:18.544 --> 26:20.212
before they're going to help?

26:20.212 --> 26:22.048
- We're not there yet.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.415
I think this is a guy.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.217
I don't know if you've
dumped him or broke his heart

26:25.251 --> 26:26.518
or never gave him
the time of day.

26:26.518 --> 26:27.353
I don't know.

26:28.520 --> 26:31.523
But I do work a lot
of domestic cases.

26:31.523 --> 26:34.060
And the one thing I can say
is these men prey on women

26:34.093 --> 26:38.097
that want to avoid
confrontation,

26:38.097 --> 26:40.532
that don't fight back.

26:40.566 --> 26:41.768
- So what are you saying?

26:43.235 --> 26:46.572
- I'm saying don't take any
crap like you did tonight.

26:46.572 --> 26:48.908
You kneed a guy in his
nuts and he left, right?

26:51.610 --> 26:52.979
- Okay.

26:52.979 --> 26:55.081
So you want me to go
around kicking guys

26:55.114 --> 26:56.783
in the crotch that
are mean to me?

26:58.417 --> 27:01.153
- What I am saying is
don't take any crap.

27:01.153 --> 27:03.389
However you'd like
to interpret that.

27:03.422 --> 27:06.158
(dramatic music)

27:35.822 --> 27:38.524
(computer rings)

27:50.536 --> 27:51.370
- Hello?

27:51.437 --> 27:54.606
(ominous music)

27:54.606 --> 27:55.441
Hello?

28:20.499 --> 28:22.902
(soft music)

28:27.807 --> 28:29.241
- Jo.

28:29.241 --> 28:30.309
- Oh my gosh.

28:31.477 --> 28:32.879
- Are you here for
the blogging position?

28:32.879 --> 28:35.047
- Yeah, I thought
I'd give it a try.

28:35.081 --> 28:36.749
You too?
- No, I'm interning

28:36.816 --> 28:38.217
here through the fall.

28:38.217 --> 28:39.485
Decided to go back to
school and get my master's.

28:39.518 --> 28:40.686
- Oh, wow.

28:40.686 --> 28:42.188
That is great, really.

28:42.221 --> 28:43.890
(elevator clanks)
- Thank you.

28:43.890 --> 28:44.723
Well, I won't keep you.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.392
It was great seeing you.

28:46.392 --> 28:47.393
Don't be nervous.

28:47.393 --> 28:49.061
They're great people here.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.096
(elevator dings)

28:50.162 --> 28:53.332
(soft music)

28:53.365 --> 28:55.701
(heels tap)

29:07.513 --> 29:10.049
(birds chirp)

29:15.254 --> 29:17.256
- Oh man. Honey.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.758
I'm sorry. I didn't
realize it was that bad.

29:19.792 --> 29:20.626
- Yeah.

29:21.460 --> 29:22.929
- You know what?

29:22.929 --> 29:25.431
I don't go anywhere
without this.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.133
I'm telling ya.

29:27.199 --> 29:28.634
And don't worry
about that letter.

29:28.634 --> 29:32.438
Between the supermarket,
church, and the hair salon,

29:32.438 --> 29:35.041
I talked to most of the
people in this neighborhood.

29:35.074 --> 29:36.742
All right.

29:36.742 --> 29:38.310
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

29:39.445 --> 29:41.447
Things might be
changing real soon, huh?

29:43.950 --> 29:44.884
- What's that mean?

29:46.452 --> 29:47.286
- Nothing.

29:51.457 --> 29:54.393
Well, my husband, Lucas,

29:56.095 --> 29:58.164
looks like he's coming
up for parole soon.

30:00.132 --> 30:01.400
That's got me nervous.

30:08.407 --> 30:10.509
He used to hit me
from time to time.

30:11.810 --> 30:14.947
But this one night,
it got really bad.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.084
Like worse than it ever was.

30:18.084 --> 30:20.652
(somber music)

30:20.652 --> 30:22.488
He was out of control.

30:25.357 --> 30:26.358
And he wouldn't stop.

30:29.295 --> 30:31.097
And one of the kids walked in.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.136
And they called the police.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.439
- I'm so sorry, Cris.

30:40.439 --> 30:41.773
- No, no.

30:41.773 --> 30:43.775
It got better after that,

30:45.011 --> 30:47.013
but with him possibly
getting out soon...

30:48.480 --> 30:50.482
His cousin's been sending
me his letters, and

30:53.652 --> 30:54.653
I don't know.

31:00.726 --> 31:01.560
We'll see.

31:02.661 --> 31:03.495
We'll see.

31:05.531 --> 31:06.365
We'll see.

31:13.172 --> 31:14.373
- So he's in the basement,

31:14.373 --> 31:16.242
hollering at me to
turn off the shower.

31:16.308 --> 31:17.977
I can't hear
anything he's saying

31:18.010 --> 31:19.711
except for him
screaming, "Cheryl!"

31:20.579 --> 31:22.414
So I'm screaming back, "What?

31:22.481 --> 31:23.549
Obviously, I'm not about to have

31:23.549 --> 31:25.084
an entire conversation-
- Do you mind

31:25.151 --> 31:27.987
if we close these blinds?

31:28.020 --> 31:30.022
- I prefer the light,
but yeah, go ahead.

31:30.056 --> 31:31.590
(ominous music)

31:31.590 --> 31:33.559
Anyway, of course he has to come

31:33.559 --> 31:35.694
all the way upstairs now,

31:35.727 --> 31:37.163
waiting for the opportunity.

31:37.163 --> 31:39.531
So I get out of the
shower, soaking wet.

31:39.565 --> 31:40.666
And finally find out...

31:40.666 --> 31:43.335
(ominous music)

31:48.574 --> 31:50.009
(slurps)

31:50.042 --> 31:52.511
(phone dings)

32:27.246 --> 32:30.082
(dial pad clicks)

32:31.483 --> 32:34.320
- Don't I get some
sort of cheat day or...

32:34.386 --> 32:36.822
- It's a cheat meal, Cal.

32:36.822 --> 32:39.992
We're only talking
about 500 calories

32:40.059 --> 32:41.227
over your maintenance.

32:41.260 --> 32:44.096
- I'm crushing your
head right now.

32:46.165 --> 32:48.267
(clicks)

32:49.168 --> 32:51.570
(soft music)

33:51.630 --> 33:54.300
(ominous music)

34:00.806 --> 34:02.141
(drink thuds)

34:02.174 --> 34:03.842
- Kickboxing after work.

34:03.875 --> 34:04.710
Yes?

34:06.345 --> 34:09.081
(intense music)

34:30.669 --> 34:33.172
- Five, four, three, two, one.

34:39.111 --> 34:41.380
(message beeps)

34:41.413 --> 34:44.082
(ominous music)

34:51.223 --> 34:53.392
(knocks)

34:56.795 --> 34:59.965
Hi, may I speak
with Cheryl please?

35:00.031 --> 35:01.400
- Not right now. She's busy.

35:02.868 --> 35:05.871
- Look, somebody has
been hacking my account.

35:05.871 --> 35:07.739
I didn't post that
comment about Cheryl.

35:07.773 --> 35:09.275
I think she looks amazing.

35:09.275 --> 35:10.976
- Maybe send her an
email or something.

35:11.042 --> 35:12.278
- Sir, can-
- Listen,

35:13.312 --> 35:15.614
my wife is in tears right now.

35:15.614 --> 35:19.117
You have no idea how hard
she's been working at this.

35:20.752 --> 35:22.087
She's gonna need some time.

35:26.825 --> 35:29.561
(ominous music)

35:37.803 --> 35:38.670
- Hey, Jo. Ooh.

35:40.672 --> 35:41.907
Sorry.

35:41.940 --> 35:43.609
My office is right
back over there.

35:43.609 --> 35:46.245
I must have eagle eyes
because I could have

35:46.245 --> 35:47.979
swore it was you.

35:47.979 --> 35:49.648
- You must.
- Yeah.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.084
How you been making out?

35:55.687 --> 35:56.522
- Read this text.

35:59.325 --> 36:02.294
It was for a blogging position
with this fitness company.

36:02.294 --> 36:06.598
It could have really just
catapulted my career.

36:07.999 --> 36:08.834
Gone.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.370
- Send me their
contact information.

36:11.370 --> 36:13.472
And I want to take a
look at that package.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.508
- You think there might
be some evidence there?

36:16.542 --> 36:17.376
- Never know.

36:19.345 --> 36:21.513
You can get most
of your information

36:21.513 --> 36:23.181
off of the internet removed.

36:24.483 --> 36:25.817
Yeah. It's easy.

36:25.817 --> 36:29.455
And there's a company
that specializes in it.

36:29.455 --> 36:30.889
Right there.

36:30.889 --> 36:32.891
They show you how to do it
right there on their website.

36:35.494 --> 36:36.895
- Thank you.

36:36.895 --> 36:37.729
- You're welcome.

36:39.865 --> 36:42.067
I still want you to keep
those wheels turning

36:42.067 --> 36:44.670
because I think it could
be someone you know.

36:48.507 --> 36:50.208
Did you say you had a boyfriend?

36:50.208 --> 36:52.010
- No, I mean, I don't.

36:53.245 --> 36:55.213
- What about the last
person you dated?

36:57.182 --> 36:59.150
- Are you asking
if it could be him?

37:00.852 --> 37:02.020
- What kind of guy is he?

37:05.056 --> 37:07.593
- He's the head of a
tech startup company,

37:07.593 --> 37:12.097
but he is not the type and he
certainly doesn't care enough

37:12.097 --> 37:14.533
about me to do something
like cyber-stalking.

37:15.734 --> 37:17.703
- Okay, well, I'll try
to get that package

37:17.703 --> 37:19.104
over for evidence.

37:19.104 --> 37:20.839
Hopefully we can get
this case more resources.

37:20.872 --> 37:24.710
(children play)
(birds chirp)

37:24.743 --> 37:27.413
(traffic whirs)

37:29.247 --> 37:30.682
(static buzz)

37:30.716 --> 37:33.051
- Hey guys, it's Jo Kelley.

37:34.453 --> 37:37.456
So today I wanted to talk to
you about a really cool item.

37:37.523 --> 37:39.558
This is the second
one that I purchased.

37:39.591 --> 37:43.962
(suspenseful music)
So it's awesome.

38:12.157 --> 38:13.925
So this isn't helpful.

38:15.093 --> 38:16.428
- Yeah, I mean it's
hard making out

38:16.428 --> 38:17.663
anything from that video.

38:17.663 --> 38:20.131
Other than another human
being is in your home.

38:20.131 --> 38:22.133
We definitely have breaking
and entering though.

38:22.133 --> 38:25.303
- So what does that
mean for my case?

38:25.337 --> 38:26.938
- It means your
case will be getting

38:26.972 --> 38:28.807
a little more attention
than it's already getting.

38:28.807 --> 38:31.309
We'll send this to forensics,
get them to enhance it.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.812
And see what we see.

38:35.981 --> 38:38.116
When did you and your
ex breakup again?

38:40.151 --> 38:41.820
- I don't know, it
was like a little over

38:41.853 --> 38:44.022
a month and a half ago.

38:44.089 --> 38:45.657
- Right when this first
started happening.

38:45.657 --> 38:47.125
(ominous music)

38:47.158 --> 38:49.294
I don't mean to scare you but

38:49.294 --> 38:51.463
maybe you need open your eyes.

38:51.463 --> 38:53.832
I'd be more than happy
to have a talk with him.

38:53.832 --> 38:56.502
(ominous music)

38:58.169 --> 39:01.673
(phone vibrates and dings)

39:17.355 --> 39:20.692
(customers chattering)

39:25.363 --> 39:27.699
- Well, you look
better than ever.

39:27.733 --> 39:29.401
- Thank you.

39:29.401 --> 39:31.470
You look well too.

39:32.704 --> 39:33.539
- How are you?

39:34.973 --> 39:36.542
- I'm okay.

39:36.542 --> 39:39.411
I've just been dealing
with a lot of stuff.

39:40.846 --> 39:42.414
How's business been going?

39:42.414 --> 39:43.582
- Well, we're
adding some features

39:43.649 --> 39:45.250
to our existing
Mood Read products.

39:45.250 --> 39:47.318
Try to make them a little
more user friendly.

39:49.020 --> 39:51.256
I'm glad you accepted
my invitation to lunch.

39:52.424 --> 39:54.593
- Hey, guys. Can I get
you something to drink?

39:54.660 --> 39:55.827
- Ladies first.

39:55.861 --> 39:58.363
- Just water with
lemon for me, please.

39:58.396 --> 39:59.264
- Water, no lemon.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.167
- So tell me-
- Garrett,

40:04.736 --> 40:07.506
the reason I agreed
to meet you for lunch

40:07.506 --> 40:11.009
was to bring up something
that I think you already know.

40:11.009 --> 40:11.843
- What's that?

40:12.878 --> 40:14.780
(sighs)

40:14.780 --> 40:18.116
- For the past six weeks,
my computer has been hacked.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.119
Posts sent out from my account.

40:22.621 --> 40:25.090
Really embarrassing photo of
myself sent to my coworkers.

40:26.091 --> 40:28.226
Strangers at my house.

40:29.928 --> 40:32.631
My home was broken
into three days ago.

40:32.631 --> 40:34.065
- You're kidding me.

40:35.801 --> 40:36.702
- I wish I was.

40:38.236 --> 40:40.972
And I would just really love
to cut all of the bull crap

40:40.972 --> 40:42.641
and get down to it.

40:42.641 --> 40:47.278
- Wait, you don't
think this was me?

40:47.278 --> 40:48.947
You can't be serious.

40:50.415 --> 40:53.084
Do you know what a typical
day looks like for me?

40:53.084 --> 40:54.920
I mean, it starts at
6:30 in the morning

40:54.953 --> 40:56.655
and I work through to
eight o'clock most nights.

40:56.655 --> 40:58.456
You know this.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.792
Do you think I
have time to what?

41:00.826 --> 41:02.160
Make your life miserable?

41:03.629 --> 41:05.997
Not to mention how
I feel for you.

41:09.568 --> 41:13.071
About that night, I'm
sorry for what you saw.

41:15.140 --> 41:16.174
For what I had done.

41:17.475 --> 41:18.644
You just left.

41:19.645 --> 41:21.079
I didn't know what to say.

41:22.247 --> 41:23.749
That's not the man
I wanna be, Jo.

41:25.150 --> 41:26.985
I haven't stopped thinking
about that night or you,

41:27.018 --> 41:27.853
since it happened

41:33.424 --> 41:36.862
I'm really worried for you.

41:36.862 --> 41:38.363
Let me help.

41:38.363 --> 41:41.700
Save all the communications
with this guy, everything,

41:41.700 --> 41:42.701
and send it to me.

41:44.603 --> 41:46.004
- The police are handling it.

41:47.272 --> 41:48.807
- The police have
thousands of cases

41:48.840 --> 41:49.708
they're going over.

41:50.676 --> 41:51.610
This is my thing.

41:53.144 --> 41:55.213
I'll make sure my top tech
guys are on it right away.

42:01.186 --> 42:02.353
- Trust me.

42:02.353 --> 42:04.322
It's good between
Garrett and the police

42:04.355 --> 42:05.991
giving my case more attention,

42:05.991 --> 42:07.826
I just feel like I can breathe.

42:09.194 --> 42:10.361
- You're not thinking
about getting back together

42:10.361 --> 42:12.163
with Garrett, are you?

42:13.464 --> 42:14.800
- No.

42:14.800 --> 42:17.202
- Jo, he cheated on you.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.373
- I'm only gonna ask once.

42:22.373 --> 42:24.242
Maybe if you're not doing
anything tomorrow night,

42:24.309 --> 42:26.845
maybe you'd like to accompany me

42:26.878 --> 42:29.981
to eat some fine Italian cuisine

42:29.981 --> 42:32.718
and maybe a few glasses
of red wine to share?

42:32.718 --> 42:34.886
Or you can have your own glass.

42:36.154 --> 42:38.156
- Weren't you just telling me

42:38.156 --> 42:40.191
that you're free tomorrow night?

42:40.225 --> 42:41.727
She's loved too.

42:44.763 --> 42:46.431
- Hmm.

42:46.431 --> 42:49.601
(upbeat rock music)

42:49.668 --> 42:51.937
All right guys, go relax.

42:51.937 --> 42:53.371
You deserve it.

42:53.404 --> 42:54.706
I'll catch you next time.

42:57.208 --> 42:58.176
(alert beeps)

42:58.176 --> 42:59.510
- [Alert Message] Low battery.

43:04.082 --> 43:06.918
(phone vibrates)

43:09.921 --> 43:12.023
- Hello?
- Hey, beautiful.

43:12.057 --> 43:14.392
My guy's found
something on your file.

43:14.392 --> 43:15.894
So far it definitely
looks like everything's

43:15.927 --> 43:17.128
coming from the same person.

43:17.128 --> 43:17.963
- Oh, wow.

43:19.230 --> 43:20.732
Well this is great.

43:20.732 --> 43:23.434
I mean, is there any way to
narrow down like who or where?

43:23.434 --> 43:25.103
- [Garrett] That's gonna
take a little bit more time,

43:25.136 --> 43:27.138
but I did wanna let you
know what I found out.

43:27.138 --> 43:28.940
- (sighs) Thank you.

43:28.940 --> 43:30.441
- You're welcome.

43:30.441 --> 43:32.410
- I can't even tell you
how much this means to me.

43:33.478 --> 43:35.080
- [Garrett] I want you back, Jo.

43:39.417 --> 43:44.422
- Garrett, I'm just not
in that place anymore.

43:45.791 --> 43:47.325
- [Garrett] I understand.

43:47.325 --> 43:49.427
Well, I'll keep you
posted on what we find.

43:49.460 --> 43:50.628
I hope you have a nice day.

43:50.628 --> 43:53.131
- Yeah, you too.

43:53.131 --> 43:54.432
Thanks, Garrett.
(phone beeps)

43:54.465 --> 43:57.468
(upbeat rock music)

43:59.004 --> 44:01.006
(sighs)

44:01.072 --> 44:05.410
- After I gave him the
old and said, "Sayonara."

44:06.477 --> 44:08.313
(chuckles)
- Did you really?

44:08.313 --> 44:11.082
- No, well, I did in
my head, of course.

44:11.116 --> 44:13.952
but then I started at
KNG three weeks later,

44:13.952 --> 44:16.154
and got to meet the lovely Jo.

44:17.355 --> 44:18.356
It was like fate.

44:18.356 --> 44:21.459
(soft music)

44:21.492 --> 44:23.094
I got an idea.

44:23.094 --> 44:24.830
Let's do that thing that
people do with their glasses.

44:24.830 --> 44:25.764
You know, here.

44:26.865 --> 44:27.833
Pick up your glass.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.301
Now.

44:30.301 --> 44:31.669
- Oh. (chuckles)
(chuckles)

44:31.669 --> 44:34.672
(soft music)

44:34.706 --> 44:36.541
(customers chattering)

44:36.541 --> 44:37.375
- Thanks.

44:38.476 --> 44:39.677
Always wanted to do that.

44:40.846 --> 44:45.851
- No problem.

44:46.617 --> 44:47.819
- You look beautiful.

44:47.853 --> 44:50.155
I, I already said
that, didn't I?

44:50.155 --> 44:51.522
- Yep. Few times.

44:53.324 --> 44:54.692
- It's hard being single.

44:54.692 --> 44:56.862
You know, it's hard
meeting people,

44:56.862 --> 44:59.530
it's like everything
about putting together

44:59.530 --> 45:01.199
a compatible
relationship with someone

45:01.199 --> 45:04.535
is hard and you have
to maintain that.

45:04.569 --> 45:06.504
We all know the
divorce statistics.

45:08.539 --> 45:10.809
I remember the day
I first met you/

45:10.809 --> 45:13.711
You looked so kind and you just,

45:13.711 --> 45:15.146
you have those kind eyes.

45:16.547 --> 45:18.516
Next thing I know, I'm
watching your workout videos

45:18.516 --> 45:19.650
and seeing what
your life was like

45:19.650 --> 45:21.152
outside the freaking office.

45:21.152 --> 45:23.654
(ominous music)

45:23.654 --> 45:25.156
I feel like I probably
know you a lot better

45:25.190 --> 45:26.357
when I look at you.

45:27.225 --> 45:29.427
But that's just my world, right?

45:29.494 --> 45:32.764
I mean, when you're in IT, all
you need to know is online.

45:34.232 --> 45:36.434
It's like can it actually
make somebody pretty lazy,

45:36.501 --> 45:39.004
but infatuated at the same time.

45:39.037 --> 45:41.106
(ominous music)

45:41.106 --> 45:43.408
I'm feeling that
wine, how about you?

45:43.408 --> 45:46.411
- Yeah, yeah, I am.

45:46.411 --> 45:48.213
- Am I making sense though?

45:48.246 --> 45:51.682
It's like, you can
feel closer to someone

45:51.682 --> 45:52.784
than you really are.

45:52.784 --> 45:54.786
Just because
there's just so much

45:54.853 --> 45:57.288
accessible
information out there.

45:57.288 --> 45:59.124
It's like being able
to see them up close

45:59.124 --> 46:01.793
and personal all the time.

46:01.860 --> 46:03.728
(ominous music)

46:03.761 --> 46:05.096
- Yeah, totally.

46:06.531 --> 46:08.599
Hey, Brent, I'm sorry. I
have to pee like really bad.

46:08.599 --> 46:10.301
So I'm just gonna go
use the restrooms.

46:10.368 --> 46:12.270
- Oh, let me go with you.
- Oh no, it's okay.

46:12.270 --> 46:13.271
I'll just be a few minutes.

46:13.271 --> 46:16.274
(suspenseful music)

46:27.052 --> 46:28.286
(knocks)

46:28.286 --> 46:30.421
(birds chirp)

46:30.455 --> 46:32.490
(knocks)

46:34.759 --> 46:36.094
- [Jo] Hold on!

46:41.166 --> 46:42.067
- You look awful.

46:43.001 --> 46:43.835
Donut?

46:45.103 --> 46:48.273
So was it really that bad?

46:49.607 --> 46:50.976
- I think it's Brent.

46:50.976 --> 46:51.776
- What?

46:52.643 --> 46:53.578
The stalker?

46:54.479 --> 46:57.315
- He got really drunk last night

46:57.315 --> 47:00.151
and just started
talking about how well

47:00.151 --> 47:03.821
he knew me from
watching me online

47:03.821 --> 47:06.992
and he knows me
better than I know.

47:07.025 --> 47:10.996
And he is seeing my life
up close and personal.

47:11.997 --> 47:13.464
- Oh my God.

47:13.498 --> 47:15.800
- I don't even think he
realized what he was saying.

47:16.834 --> 47:17.768
- What did you say?

47:19.170 --> 47:21.606
- Well, I said I had to pee
and I took off and I came home.

47:23.341 --> 47:24.175
- Oh, wow.

47:26.344 --> 47:27.645
Brent really is a creeper.

47:29.514 --> 47:30.648
What do the police say?

47:32.517 --> 47:33.818
- (sighs) Trust me.

47:35.553 --> 47:38.289
It is not enough for
them to do anything.

47:38.323 --> 47:41.059
(ominous music)

48:06.551 --> 48:09.554
- (sighs) This is
very disappointing.

48:09.587 --> 48:12.057
- Jason, please let
me explain something-

48:12.057 --> 48:14.359
- Please, just
come to my office.

48:14.392 --> 48:17.728
(employees chattering)

48:30.775 --> 48:32.210
- Jo.

48:32.243 --> 48:33.911
- Stay away from me.
- No, Jason just told me.

48:33.911 --> 48:35.346
Jo, I would never do
something like that.

48:35.380 --> 48:37.048
- Brent, can you please just-
- I'm sorry if anything

48:37.082 --> 48:38.583
I said freaked you
out last night, okay?

48:38.583 --> 48:40.018
The wine was really-
- Oh, okay.

48:40.051 --> 48:42.420
How you knew me so well
from watching me online

48:42.420 --> 48:44.422
and then today I found out
you've been researching me,

48:44.455 --> 48:45.723
and then I get fired!

48:45.756 --> 48:47.758
- Jo, please, no,
that's, I'm not a person

48:47.758 --> 48:49.427
that would do
something like that.

48:51.729 --> 48:54.632
Everybody knows I've had a
crush on you since day one.

48:54.632 --> 48:57.302
Honestly, I just didn't
always feel like I knew

48:57.368 --> 48:58.569
what to say around you.

48:58.603 --> 49:01.706
So I felt like I'd get
to know you better.

49:01.706 --> 49:04.209
It's the only way I
knew how, the internet.

49:06.311 --> 49:08.813
That's what I was
talking about, Jo.

49:08.813 --> 49:10.881
I actually got hacked
too, if it helps.

49:10.915 --> 49:12.950
(soft music)

49:12.950 --> 49:16.387
Sorry, Jo, I just,

49:16.421 --> 49:18.823
I didn't want you to leave
without saying goodbye.

49:20.058 --> 49:21.492
I just think you're
a wonderful person.

49:22.660 --> 49:25.496
Be safe and take
care of yourself.

49:27.498 --> 49:28.333
- Brent.

49:31.002 --> 49:31.836
You too.

49:33.671 --> 49:34.505
See ya.

49:48.786 --> 49:51.122
- Why didn't you tell me
about all this sooner?

49:52.757 --> 49:54.192
- I didn't want you to worry.

49:56.327 --> 49:57.862
- What can I do?

49:57.862 --> 49:59.830
Is there anything I can do?

49:59.830 --> 50:01.466
- No.

50:01.499 --> 50:05.336
And just being here like
you are right now and this.

50:06.271 --> 50:07.938
(birds chirp)

50:07.938 --> 50:09.540
- You always loved the Lake.

50:10.875 --> 50:12.543
I'll never forget this one time.

50:13.711 --> 50:15.313
You couldn't have been
no more than seven.

50:15.346 --> 50:18.883
And you had just won the kids
division fishing tournament,

50:18.883 --> 50:21.386
a little cabby about
maybe that big,

50:21.386 --> 50:23.121
you were all proud
and they gave you

50:23.154 --> 50:25.823
this little plastic
trophy with a fish on it.

50:25.856 --> 50:28.126
And that one little
red-headed boy,

50:28.126 --> 50:29.560
well, he took your trophy 'cause

50:29.560 --> 50:32.130
he said his fish was bigger.

50:32.163 --> 50:35.166
You came to me and I
said go and get it back.

50:35.200 --> 50:37.168
Well, I see you walk up to him

50:38.369 --> 50:40.505
and I see him
shaking his head, no.

50:41.706 --> 50:44.642
You had the calmest
look on your face.

50:44.642 --> 50:47.578
You walked down to the shore
where his tackle box was

50:47.578 --> 50:49.880
and you chucked that
thing into the water

50:49.880 --> 50:51.015
as hard as you could.

50:51.048 --> 50:53.351
(chuckles)

50:54.552 --> 50:56.154
- Oh, yeah.

50:58.356 --> 50:59.157
Who was she?

51:00.391 --> 51:02.260
- You got your trophy
back, didn't you?

51:04.562 --> 51:05.396
- Yeah.

51:06.864 --> 51:07.898
Yes, I did

51:10.701 --> 51:13.104
(soft music)

51:30.921 --> 51:32.056
(knocks)

51:32.089 --> 51:35.126
(ominous music)

51:35.126 --> 51:35.960
Cristina?

51:37.262 --> 51:39.430
(knocks)

51:42.967 --> 51:43.768
- Oh.

51:44.735 --> 51:46.537
- What happened?

51:46.537 --> 51:48.706
Can I get you a doctor?

51:48.706 --> 51:50.040
What happened?
- I wish

51:50.074 --> 51:51.709
you would have left.

51:53.478 --> 51:55.980
(sighs)

51:56.046 --> 51:57.648
- I'm your friend, Cristina.

52:00.385 --> 52:03.721
- They brought Lucas
home two weeks ago.

52:03.754 --> 52:05.623
(sobs)

52:06.991 --> 52:08.493
I don't know what I've done.

52:08.493 --> 52:10.828
(sobs)

52:10.895 --> 52:11.729
- Cristina.

52:12.897 --> 52:14.899
I know someone at
the police station.

52:15.800 --> 52:17.935
Okay. He can help you.

52:17.935 --> 52:19.904
- No, honey, no.

52:22.307 --> 52:24.008
Listen to me.

52:24.008 --> 52:25.910
I made this bed.

52:25.943 --> 52:27.478
I don't want any police.

52:27.478 --> 52:28.613
Not this time.

52:30.014 --> 52:30.848
I gotta fix this.

52:32.350 --> 52:35.119
I gotta fix this on my own.

52:35.152 --> 52:37.488
(whimpers)

52:37.488 --> 52:38.323
- How?

52:40.991 --> 52:42.760
(whimpers)

52:42.760 --> 52:44.329
- I don't know.

52:44.329 --> 52:46.264
(sobs)

52:49.467 --> 52:50.301
- Here.

52:51.269 --> 52:52.837
Stand up.

52:52.837 --> 52:54.505
- No.
- I wanna show you something.

52:54.539 --> 52:55.773
- Why?

52:55.806 --> 52:58.008
- You have missed
our last two sessions

52:58.008 --> 52:59.810
and I have something
new to show you.

52:59.844 --> 53:01.011
- Why?
- Stand up.

53:01.011 --> 53:03.381
(gentle music)
(sobs)

53:03.381 --> 53:05.182
Here. Stand for me.

53:06.116 --> 53:07.785
* We are broken

53:07.818 --> 53:10.355
* We have flawless lives

53:10.355 --> 53:11.188
Arms up.

53:12.122 --> 53:13.391
(music drowns out voice)

53:13.391 --> 53:18.396
* We've been sleeping
for the longest time *

53:20.698 --> 53:25.703
* A sleep of the eternal kind

53:26.871 --> 53:30.975
* We are corpses in
our own paradigm *

53:33.077 --> 53:38.082
* So let's find
the broken pieces *

53:40.385 --> 53:45.390
* And bring them back to life

53:47.558 --> 53:52.563
* No change won't
come in a night *

53:54.665 --> 53:58.002
* We must make the time

53:58.869 --> 54:01.906
(gentle guitar music)

54:05.276 --> 54:10.281
* Our eyes have been shattered

54:12.783 --> 54:16.621
* Hearts dropped on the floor

54:19.590 --> 54:22.092
(soft music)

54:41.412 --> 54:43.448
- Hey, how are you?

54:43.448 --> 54:44.782
- Not bad. You?

54:45.750 --> 54:47.418
- Fantastic.

54:47.452 --> 54:49.787
You up for some sparring action?

54:49.787 --> 54:52.122
I want a video of us for
a new intro to my channel

54:52.122 --> 54:53.223
that I might be doing.

54:54.124 --> 54:55.826
That or I can show my followers

54:55.893 --> 54:57.261
the new and talented Jo.

54:58.228 --> 54:59.430
- [Jo] Whatever you want.

55:00.431 --> 55:01.332
- Cool.

55:01.332 --> 55:02.333
Grab some gloves.

55:10.508 --> 55:12.109
- Should we turn off the lights?

55:13.844 --> 55:15.312
- No, I wanna keep them low

55:15.312 --> 55:16.414
for the lighting effect.

55:16.447 --> 55:18.349
If that's okay.

55:18.349 --> 55:20.351
Shows a bit more definition.

55:20.351 --> 55:21.686
- Got ya.

55:21.752 --> 55:23.287
- You ready?

55:23.320 --> 55:24.822
- Yeah.
- Bring it.

55:26.090 --> 55:27.257
(gloves thud)

55:27.291 --> 55:28.292
Jeez.

55:28.292 --> 55:30.961
(gloves thud)

55:30.961 --> 55:33.664
I can tell you've
been practicing.

55:33.664 --> 55:35.032
(gloves thud)

55:35.099 --> 55:37.201
(intense music)

55:37.201 --> 55:38.703
- Everybody's doing
what they feel they need

55:38.703 --> 55:39.870
to do to stay ahead.

55:42.106 --> 55:44.375
It's all a part of the game.

55:51.849 --> 55:53.784
(arm and foot whacks)

55:53.818 --> 55:55.185
Damn, Jo.

55:55.185 --> 55:56.854
I thought we were just sparring.

55:56.854 --> 56:00.224
(intense music)

56:00.290 --> 56:03.193
(gloves thud)
(both grunt)

56:03.193 --> 56:04.228
(fence clatters)

56:04.294 --> 56:06.964
(intense music)

56:12.002 --> 56:14.505
(gloves thud)

56:23.581 --> 56:24.849
(gloves thud)

56:24.882 --> 56:28.486
And when it does happen,
don't take it personal.

56:28.486 --> 56:29.386
(gloves thud)

56:29.386 --> 56:32.056
(intense music)

56:35.993 --> 56:37.495
Only the strong survive.

56:38.529 --> 56:40.531
(gloves thud)
(both grunt)

56:40.565 --> 56:43.901
(ominous music)

56:43.901 --> 56:46.203
Those were some quick reflexes.

56:46.203 --> 56:47.237
I'm impressed.

56:49.273 --> 56:51.208
Don't go anywhere.
I'm gonna go cool off.

57:01.251 --> 57:03.621
(car starts)

57:10.728 --> 57:13.430
(intense music)

57:20.705 --> 57:21.739
Where are you going?

57:21.772 --> 57:23.541
I just wanted to cool off.

57:23.541 --> 57:25.543
- I'm sorry. I just,
I feel really sick.

57:26.777 --> 57:27.812
- Are you okay?

57:27.878 --> 57:30.548
(ominous music)

57:35.586 --> 57:38.155
(rope clicks)

57:49.634 --> 57:50.968
- It's not as
clear as I'd hoped,

57:50.968 --> 57:52.637
but that's definitely a watch,

57:52.637 --> 57:54.071
but I don't know
what the red is.

57:54.104 --> 57:55.740
Maybe a reflection or something.

57:55.740 --> 57:58.275
- Yeah, it's gotta be a watch.

57:58.308 --> 58:01.011
And I should tell you my ex,

58:01.011 --> 58:03.180
the one with that
startup company,

58:03.180 --> 58:05.315
he had his tech guys
look at all the evidence

58:05.315 --> 58:07.084
and they actually
found something.

58:07.117 --> 58:08.519
It's pointing to a woman

58:08.519 --> 58:09.987
I have recently been
spending time with

58:09.987 --> 58:11.155
in the fitness industry.

58:12.322 --> 58:14.959
- Whoa, wait, wait a second.

58:14.959 --> 58:16.093
You're telling me that now?

58:16.093 --> 58:18.663
What's her name?
- Dahlia.

58:18.663 --> 58:20.931
Dahlia Berry. And I'm sorry.

58:20.965 --> 58:22.967
I should have told you sooner.

58:23.000 --> 58:26.170
- I'm gonna need your ex's
name and phone number please.

58:29.373 --> 58:30.875
How's everything
else been going?

58:30.875 --> 58:33.310
(crows caw)

58:34.278 --> 58:36.280
- I don't know. (chuckles)

58:36.313 --> 58:38.783
This has been my life
for the past two months.

58:40.851 --> 58:42.486
Thanks. So yeah.

58:42.519 --> 58:43.854
Give Garrett a call and tell him

58:43.854 --> 58:46.123
that you're handling
the case for Jo Kelley.

58:46.156 --> 58:48.392
I mean, I think-
- I'm a detective.

58:48.392 --> 58:50.294
(chuckles)

58:50.327 --> 58:51.662
- Right.

58:51.662 --> 58:54.198
Well, thanks. I appreciate it.

58:54.198 --> 58:55.633
- Hey, I was thinking maybe

58:55.666 --> 58:58.736
we could have dinner
sometime, maybe this week.

59:00.705 --> 59:01.505
- Yeah.

59:02.873 --> 59:04.709
- We can discuss the case.

59:04.742 --> 59:07.077
(chuckles)

59:11.048 --> 59:12.216
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

59:12.216 --> 59:13.918
- Oh, it wasn't long.

59:18.155 --> 59:19.156
- How do you like the new brains

59:19.189 --> 59:21.191
to our Mood Read
technology here?

59:21.225 --> 59:23.027
- Oh, it's nice.

59:23.027 --> 59:23.861
- Huh?

59:24.995 --> 59:26.496
All right.

59:26.496 --> 59:27.698
Let's see what we got here.

59:27.732 --> 59:29.900
I think you're gonna
be really happy

59:29.900 --> 59:31.068
with what we've got so far.

59:31.068 --> 59:32.903
Granted, we just got
started on it last week,

59:32.937 --> 59:36.941
but I think there's more
than enough to, hello?

59:37.007 --> 59:38.542
(ominous music)

59:38.575 --> 59:40.110
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

59:41.378 --> 59:43.280
I just remembered, I
have a training session

59:43.280 --> 59:45.115
I have to be to in
like 15 minutes.

59:45.182 --> 59:47.051
- Well can't you
cancel your session?

59:48.252 --> 59:49.353
Hey, you know what?

59:49.353 --> 59:50.254
You go.

59:51.388 --> 59:54.191
I'm open later tonight
if you wanna...

59:54.191 --> 59:56.894
(ominous music)

59:59.630 --> 1:00:03.300
Well, this is
awkward, isn't it, Jo?

1:00:03.367 --> 1:00:05.202
You're supposed to give
me everything you had.

1:00:05.235 --> 1:00:07.938
(ominous music)

1:00:13.978 --> 1:00:15.946
Now we're in quite a
predicament, aren't we?

1:00:15.946 --> 1:00:17.782
(suspenseful music)

1:00:17.782 --> 1:00:19.283
It's nice. Isn't it.

1:00:19.283 --> 1:00:20.885
We're finally able to
create a smart watch

1:00:20.918 --> 1:00:22.920
with the Mood Read hardware.

1:00:22.920 --> 1:00:26.456
It's convenient, rather
than look at your phone,

1:00:26.456 --> 1:00:29.660
it just lights up the right
color and gives you advice.

1:00:29.727 --> 1:00:31.061
This is our only prototype.

1:00:32.262 --> 1:00:35.265
You won't find another
one like it anywhere.

1:00:37.601 --> 1:00:41.138
Hey, Jo, what's already
happened to you.

1:00:43.340 --> 1:00:45.009
If you say anything to anyone,

1:00:46.276 --> 1:00:48.112
I'm gonna let you
know right now,

1:00:48.145 --> 1:00:50.314
before will be nothing
compared to the after.

1:00:50.314 --> 1:00:53.017
(intense music)

1:00:54.584 --> 1:00:56.086
- You're absolutely sure.

1:00:56.120 --> 1:00:59.656
- This is the enhanced version
of the intruder at my house.

1:01:00.624 --> 1:01:03.460
Garrett was wearing that watch.

1:01:03.493 --> 1:01:04.494
I saw it.

1:01:07.664 --> 1:01:08.498
I'm scared.

1:01:10.868 --> 1:01:12.202
- Did you show the police?

1:01:14.604 --> 1:01:16.673
- He threatened me that
things were gonna get

1:01:16.673 --> 1:01:19.009
a whole lot worse if
I opened my mouth.

1:01:20.677 --> 1:01:22.679
So what options do I have?

1:01:24.514 --> 1:01:26.450
You've seen what he's
capable of doing.

1:01:28.185 --> 1:01:31.388
I am a sitting duck
if I stay here.

1:01:31.455 --> 1:01:34.124
(ominous music)

1:01:38.996 --> 1:01:42.699
(chattering on police radio)

1:01:55.379 --> 1:01:57.414
(cries)

1:02:00.084 --> 1:02:00.851
- Joanna.

1:02:02.853 --> 1:02:03.687
Hi.

1:02:05.255 --> 1:02:06.590
We've never met.

1:02:08.058 --> 1:02:11.228
I know my mother was taking
personal training with you.

1:02:11.261 --> 1:02:12.162
I'm Gabrielle.

1:02:13.063 --> 1:02:15.399
- Cristina, your mom.

1:02:15.399 --> 1:02:17.034
She told me a lot about you.

1:02:17.067 --> 1:02:18.402
- Yeah.

1:02:18.402 --> 1:02:20.004
She told me a lot about you too.

1:02:21.605 --> 1:02:23.040
- Did you teach her to fight?

1:02:25.242 --> 1:02:26.877
- Um, fight...

1:02:26.877 --> 1:02:27.878
- My father, he's,

1:02:30.580 --> 1:02:32.082
he's in the hospital right now.

1:02:33.383 --> 1:02:34.785
She broke his jaw.

1:02:36.686 --> 1:02:41.025
Growing up, she
never fought back.

1:02:42.259 --> 1:02:46.463
I used to just watch
him throw her around.

1:02:46.463 --> 1:02:47.798
You know?

1:02:47.798 --> 1:02:50.300
(dramatic music)

1:02:50.300 --> 1:02:54.204
This time, she knew
that he could kill her.

1:02:55.605 --> 1:02:56.874
And she hit him anyway.

1:02:59.877 --> 1:03:01.578
That means something.

1:03:01.611 --> 1:03:03.647
That she wasn't going
to take it anymore.

1:03:05.449 --> 1:03:08.485
And in some really weird way,

1:03:10.420 --> 1:03:11.956
it's helped me find some peace.

1:03:16.126 --> 1:03:16.961
So thank you.

1:03:16.961 --> 1:03:20.130
(dramatic music)

1:03:20.130 --> 1:03:22.232
You helped her
find her strength.

1:03:22.266 --> 1:03:24.902
And I'm forever grateful.

1:03:27.071 --> 1:03:28.572
Thank you so much.

1:03:31.075 --> 1:03:32.076
Thank you.

1:03:32.109 --> 1:03:34.111
(cries)

1:03:40.284 --> 1:03:42.786
(soft music)

1:04:33.537 --> 1:04:36.573
- So would you like for
me to email that to you?

1:04:36.573 --> 1:04:38.575
- Actually, would you
mind just writing it down?

1:04:38.642 --> 1:04:39.809
- Sure.

1:04:39.843 --> 1:04:42.212
(soft music)

1:04:43.981 --> 1:04:46.483
(ducks quack)

1:04:48.718 --> 1:04:51.255
(phone rings)

1:04:56.660 --> 1:04:57.861
- Hey, Dad.

1:04:57.894 --> 1:05:00.564
(intense music)

1:05:03.700 --> 1:05:04.935
- [Officer] All right,
sir. I'm gonna go inside.

1:05:04.935 --> 1:05:06.270
Take a quick look. Make
sure nothing's missing.

1:05:06.270 --> 1:05:07.271
Okay?

1:05:07.337 --> 1:05:08.705
- Oh, God.

1:05:08.738 --> 1:05:10.207
- I'm fine.

1:05:10.207 --> 1:05:11.075
It's just nothing.

1:05:13.243 --> 1:05:14.078
- Who was here?

1:05:15.245 --> 1:05:16.413
- I don't know.

1:05:16.446 --> 1:05:18.348
Got home from the lodge.

1:05:18.382 --> 1:05:20.717
And had a few beers in me.

1:05:20.750 --> 1:05:23.287
And he must've been waiting
because he followed me in

1:05:23.287 --> 1:05:25.389
when I unlocked the door.

1:05:25.422 --> 1:05:26.456
- Sir, could I have
you come inside

1:05:26.456 --> 1:05:27.958
and take a look with me?

1:05:27.958 --> 1:05:30.760
(chattering on police radio)

1:05:30.760 --> 1:05:32.929
Sir, I don't know if
any valuables were
taken or anything,

1:05:32.963 --> 1:05:35.299
but some of the drawers
were tossed open.

1:05:35.365 --> 1:05:36.866
And you can take a look.

1:05:36.866 --> 1:05:38.268
Let's me know if anything
looks like it's missing.

1:05:38.268 --> 1:05:40.971
(ominous music)

1:05:43.773 --> 1:05:45.775
You wanna come back
here and take a look.

1:05:45.809 --> 1:05:48.478
(intense music)

1:05:53.317 --> 1:05:55.986
(papers rustle)

1:05:56.886 --> 1:05:59.456
(phone beeps)

1:06:11.468 --> 1:06:14.471
- Thank you so much for
agreeing to meet with me.

1:06:14.504 --> 1:06:16.740
- Yeah. It's no problem.

1:06:18.175 --> 1:06:22.012
- Um, so I tried to look up
your sister's profile, but I,

1:06:22.079 --> 1:06:23.480
I didn't see anything.

1:06:23.480 --> 1:06:26.983
- Well, you probably wouldn't
find anything anywhere.

1:06:26.983 --> 1:06:29.853
She went off the
map after Garrett.

1:06:29.919 --> 1:06:32.422
- How long were they together?

1:06:32.422 --> 1:06:34.524
- Um, I wouldn't
even say a year.

1:06:36.093 --> 1:06:39.029
When she ended it, he
was just relentless.

1:06:39.029 --> 1:06:41.765
You know, his ability
to hack into things.

1:06:41.798 --> 1:06:43.933
That's why I wanted to
meet with you in person.

1:06:43.933 --> 1:06:47.271
I won't do anything too
serious online anymore.

1:06:47.271 --> 1:06:49.706
- Yeah, I've had a crash course

1:06:49.706 --> 1:06:51.275
in what he's capable of doing.

1:06:52.176 --> 1:06:53.677
- That bastard.

1:06:53.710 --> 1:06:56.613
And I'm guessing the police
aren't able to help you.

1:06:56.646 --> 1:07:00.284
- Well, I mean, it's
definitely been a process.

1:07:00.284 --> 1:07:01.118
- I can relate.

1:07:02.619 --> 1:07:04.788
- How did your sister
get it to stop?

1:07:06.623 --> 1:07:07.457
- Um,

1:07:09.025 --> 1:07:12.696
my sister Bree committed suicide
two and a half years ago.

1:07:15.031 --> 1:07:16.333
- I'm so sorry.

1:07:17.301 --> 1:07:18.735
I didn't know.

1:07:18.735 --> 1:07:19.569
- It's okay.

1:07:22.339 --> 1:07:23.507
But he didn't stop.

1:07:25.008 --> 1:07:26.710
He didn't stop
until she was dead.

1:07:26.710 --> 1:07:29.479
(dramatic music)

1:08:17.694 --> 1:08:19.763
* See it's the option,
never standing by *

1:08:19.763 --> 1:08:21.064
* Or be willing to die

1:08:21.097 --> 1:08:23.967
* Go into battle with
the honor of a samurai *

1:08:23.967 --> 1:08:26.703
* Win or lose, it's up
because then I had to try *

1:08:26.736 --> 1:08:29.072
* And live the life only
God oughta analyze *

1:08:29.072 --> 1:08:31.641
(upbeat music)

1:08:53.096 --> 1:08:55.799
(traffic whirs)

1:08:59.102 --> 1:09:01.271
- You have solid experience

1:09:03.139 --> 1:09:05.275
and a very pleasant
speaking voice.

1:09:06.443 --> 1:09:07.944
A lot of people
don't realize it,

1:09:07.944 --> 1:09:10.447
but a friendly voice on
the other end of the phone

1:09:10.447 --> 1:09:11.681
goes a long way.

1:09:11.681 --> 1:09:13.250
- Oh, yes, I agree.

1:09:15.419 --> 1:09:17.421
- The problem is this.

1:09:28.465 --> 1:09:32.336
- I have a stalker and, um,

1:09:32.336 --> 1:09:35.138
I mean, there's no way
I could prove it to you,

1:09:35.171 --> 1:09:40.176
but he has done
everything to keep me

1:09:40.877 --> 1:09:42.346
from basically living.

1:09:44.214 --> 1:09:46.216
This would be the third time

1:09:46.283 --> 1:09:48.218
that he sabotaged my employment.

1:09:49.519 --> 1:09:51.020
- A stalker, huh?

1:09:54.891 --> 1:09:56.025
(sighs)

1:09:56.025 --> 1:09:58.462
Our CEO is my brother-in-law.

1:10:00.196 --> 1:10:01.665
He's a pain in the ass,

1:10:01.665 --> 1:10:04.734
but I have a lot of respect
for him and the company.

1:10:06.670 --> 1:10:09.239
We get a lot of business
because we've always made it

1:10:09.239 --> 1:10:12.242
one of our top priorities
to be very careful

1:10:12.309 --> 1:10:14.143
about who we bring on our team.

1:10:15.345 --> 1:10:17.647
I'm sure you're a
fantastic woman.

1:10:17.647 --> 1:10:19.649
And that's why this
is happening to you.

1:10:20.684 --> 1:10:24.187
People who feed on control

1:10:25.221 --> 1:10:27.557
are always threatened
by strength.

1:10:30.394 --> 1:10:33.062
I have some time before I
have to fill this position.

1:10:34.731 --> 1:10:36.099
I don't know how
you're gonna do it,

1:10:36.099 --> 1:10:38.902
but if we're gonna hire you,

1:10:38.902 --> 1:10:42.406
we can't have things
like this popping up.

1:10:43.740 --> 1:10:45.575
Do you understand?
- Yes.

1:10:47.511 --> 1:10:48.345
- Here's my card.

1:10:50.046 --> 1:10:51.515
Two weeks.

1:10:51.515 --> 1:10:52.282
Give me a call.

1:10:53.417 --> 1:10:54.217
- Thank you.

1:10:55.619 --> 1:10:56.920
- Be unpredictable.

1:10:59.756 --> 1:11:00.557
- I'm sorry, what?

1:11:02.091 --> 1:11:03.059
- Bullies like that

1:11:05.261 --> 1:11:08.432
know what to expect from you.

1:11:08.465 --> 1:11:11.868
Know where you are
and what you're doing.

1:11:15.772 --> 1:11:17.140
Be unpredictable.

1:11:17.206 --> 1:11:19.909
(dramatic music)

1:12:06.456 --> 1:12:08.458
(sighs)

1:12:11.194 --> 1:12:12.829
Bullies like that

1:12:12.829 --> 1:12:15.198
know what to expect from you.

1:12:16.500 --> 1:12:18.001
Be unpredictable.

1:12:28.211 --> 1:12:29.045
- Hello.

1:12:29.879 --> 1:12:32.115
I saw you staring at me.

1:12:32.148 --> 1:12:34.317
And I was just wondering
if there was anything

1:12:34.317 --> 1:12:36.285
I could help you with.

1:12:36.285 --> 1:12:38.321
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1:12:38.354 --> 1:12:39.623
Didn't mean to stare.

1:12:41.024 --> 1:12:41.858
- Good.

1:12:54.904 --> 1:12:57.541
- Um, I'm getting
little hunger pains.

1:12:57.541 --> 1:13:00.376
Are you guys thinking about
maybe getting something to eat?

1:13:01.811 --> 1:13:03.012
- [Man] Yeah, I heard
about this great oyster bar

1:13:03.046 --> 1:13:05.515
in Cherry Creek.
- Yeah, it's excellent.

1:13:05.515 --> 1:13:07.517
What did you just
grab that off of Yelp?

1:13:08.885 --> 1:13:10.887
- I'm gonna need to go
back to my hotel for a bit.

1:13:10.887 --> 1:13:12.656
- Okay.
- Ah, go back, get some rest,

1:13:12.689 --> 1:13:14.658
and we'll meet Blue
Island, eight o'clock.

1:13:14.658 --> 1:13:16.426
- [Man] See you then.

1:13:16.426 --> 1:13:17.861
(intense music)

1:13:17.894 --> 1:13:19.228
- Hi.

1:13:19.228 --> 1:13:20.597
Want a hot date tonight?

1:13:20.664 --> 1:13:23.332
(intense music)

1:13:31.240 --> 1:13:32.742
(customers chattering)

1:13:32.776 --> 1:13:36.345
(soft piano music)

1:13:36.379 --> 1:13:37.280
- You okay?

1:13:38.347 --> 1:13:39.182
- Yeah.

1:13:41.050 --> 1:13:43.052
- Anything on your mind?

1:13:43.086 --> 1:13:43.920
- Always.

1:13:47.724 --> 1:13:49.192
- Wanna talk about it?

1:13:49.192 --> 1:13:52.261
- I just wanna have a
good time and relax.

1:13:52.261 --> 1:13:53.897
- Oh, we can do that.
(chuckles)

1:13:53.930 --> 1:13:56.299
We're gonna have a good time.

1:13:57.366 --> 1:13:59.068
- There's something else...

1:13:59.102 --> 1:14:03.973
(customers chattering)
(soft piano music)

1:14:05.108 --> 1:14:07.143
- I'm gonna just
run to the restroom.

1:14:08.444 --> 1:14:11.147
(dramatic music)

1:14:20.924 --> 1:14:22.125
- Well, hello.

1:14:25.562 --> 1:14:27.597
Now, if I know Garrett,

1:14:27.631 --> 1:14:29.933
he's already peeking
your interest

1:14:29.933 --> 1:14:32.502
with some of his brand new toys.

1:14:32.502 --> 1:14:34.638
Did he tell you about his watch

1:14:34.638 --> 1:14:36.573
that can detect a person's mood?

1:14:40.276 --> 1:14:42.679
Oh, this isn't
your special watch.

1:14:44.113 --> 1:14:46.349
- We were just discussing
our mobile technology.

1:14:47.584 --> 1:14:48.918
How about you get
a drink at the bar

1:14:48.918 --> 1:14:50.486
and I'll meet up with you later?

1:14:50.486 --> 1:14:51.821
- Oh, of course.

1:14:51.821 --> 1:14:53.990
But before I go, I
just wanted to share

1:14:53.990 --> 1:14:55.659
my own thoughts on it.

1:14:55.659 --> 1:15:00.630
See, Garrett here is such
an incredibly intelligent

1:15:02.131 --> 1:15:05.468
and genius businessman and
it's actually quite funny.

1:15:05.468 --> 1:15:08.838
I've realized that his
ability to outmaneuver

1:15:08.838 --> 1:15:12.341
some of the top
CEOs in the world

1:15:12.375 --> 1:15:14.343
is because of this mood watch.

1:15:15.779 --> 1:15:17.346
(chuckles)

1:15:17.346 --> 1:15:22.185
See when you have no emotional
intelligence or ethics,

1:15:22.185 --> 1:15:23.887
it can be a lifesaver.

1:15:23.953 --> 1:15:27.456
(ominous music)

1:15:27.490 --> 1:15:28.658
Watch out for this one.

1:15:33.196 --> 1:15:34.497
We gotta go.

1:15:34.530 --> 1:15:36.199
- What? I just
ordered us some beers.

1:15:36.199 --> 1:15:37.901
- Yeah, I ran into
a girl that used

1:15:37.901 --> 1:15:38.835
to date my ex in the bathroom.

1:15:38.868 --> 1:15:40.036
It was really awkward.

1:15:40.036 --> 1:15:41.304
- Oh.
- Some come on, there's a

1:15:41.337 --> 1:15:42.538
place on Larimer I
think you'll like.

1:15:42.538 --> 1:15:45.241
(dramatic music)

1:15:47.577 --> 1:15:50.246
(gentle music)

1:15:50.246 --> 1:15:52.481
- I was hoping I could
get a good night kiss.

1:16:05.695 --> 1:16:08.531
(dramatic music)

1:16:13.169 --> 1:16:14.337
- One, two.
(gloves thud)

1:16:14.370 --> 1:16:16.039
One, two, three.
(gloves thud)

1:16:16.039 --> 1:16:17.373
One, two.
(gloves thud)

1:16:17.406 --> 1:16:18.742
One, two, one.
(gloves thud)

1:16:18.742 --> 1:16:21.711
Nice, one, two, three.
(gloves thud)

1:16:21.745 --> 1:16:26.750
One, two.
(gloves thud)

1:16:29.953 --> 1:16:31.387
(keys jangle)

1:16:31.420 --> 1:16:33.422
(phone vibrates and dings)

1:16:33.422 --> 1:16:36.092
(ominous music)

1:16:37.393 --> 1:16:39.295
(keys jangle)

1:16:39.295 --> 1:16:40.296
(intense music)
(man grunts)

1:16:40.363 --> 1:16:42.531
(groans)
- Shut up!

1:16:42.531 --> 1:16:45.201
(intense music)

1:16:47.904 --> 1:16:50.073
(screams)

1:16:56.880 --> 1:16:59.582
(object jangles)

1:17:00.917 --> 1:17:04.120
(both grunt)

1:17:04.120 --> 1:17:05.421
(hand whacks)
(groans)

1:17:05.454 --> 1:17:08.124
(intense music)

1:17:18.735 --> 1:17:21.637
(breathes heavily)

1:17:26.275 --> 1:17:29.012
(dramatic music)

1:18:31.174 --> 1:18:34.177
(keyboard clatters)

1:19:02.872 --> 1:19:04.040
(water pours)

1:19:04.073 --> 1:19:08.711
(electricity zaps)
(smoke hisses)

1:19:36.439 --> 1:19:38.474
(intense music)

1:19:38.541 --> 1:19:40.576

1:19:53.089 --> 1:19:56.325

1:19:58.794 --> 1:20:00.163
(shirt tears)

1:20:00.163 --> 1:20:01.397
(foot thuds)

1:20:01.430 --> 1:20:04.100
(intense music)

1:20:06.836 --> 1:20:08.905
(groans)

1:20:12.475 --> 1:20:14.110
- You think I won't find you?

1:20:14.110 --> 1:20:16.779
(intense music)

1:20:43.806 --> 1:20:46.876
(keys jangle)

1:20:46.876 --> 1:20:49.212
(both grunt)

1:20:51.680 --> 1:20:52.548
(body thuds)

1:20:52.548 --> 1:20:53.349
I swear...

1:20:54.650 --> 1:20:56.152
You're such a stupid bitch.

1:20:56.185 --> 1:20:57.954
- And you're a piece of crap!

1:20:57.954 --> 1:20:59.222
(camera beeps)

1:20:59.222 --> 1:21:00.223
(foot thuds)

1:21:10.166 --> 1:21:13.369
(weights clink)

1:21:13.369 --> 1:21:16.372
- There's a picture of you.

1:21:16.405 --> 1:21:18.407
It was sent to everyone.

1:21:21.510 --> 1:21:24.180
(weight whacks)

1:21:25.148 --> 1:21:26.182
(grunts)

1:22:05.454 --> 1:22:07.723
(screams)

1:22:13.296 --> 1:22:15.064
- But he didn't stop,

1:22:16.199 --> 1:22:17.967
he didn't stop
until she was dead.

1:22:17.967 --> 1:22:20.636
(intense music)

1:22:24.140 --> 1:22:26.575
(camera beeps)

1:22:26.609 --> 1:22:28.777
- [Alert Message] Low battery.

1:22:28.777 --> 1:22:30.146
- Set to profile!

1:22:31.747 --> 1:22:32.748
(phone beeps)

1:22:32.781 --> 1:22:35.451

1:22:43.993 --> 1:22:46.895
(breathes heavily)

1:22:55.638 --> 1:22:56.605
- Oh my God.

1:22:57.506 --> 1:22:58.307
Oh, shit.

1:23:00.243 --> 1:23:01.677
Yes, you need to send
someone to the gym

1:23:01.677 --> 1:23:02.845
at 9th and Santa Fe.

1:23:04.847 --> 1:23:05.914
(camera clacks)

1:23:05.948 --> 1:23:08.617
(intense music)

1:23:15.024 --> 1:23:17.593
(sirens blare)

1:23:24.500 --> 1:23:25.501
- Jo, Jo, Jo.

1:23:25.501 --> 1:23:27.836
(dramatic music)
Stay with me.

1:23:27.836 --> 1:23:30.506
(sirens blare)

1:23:34.943 --> 1:23:36.645
- [Reporter] And now with
breaking news from Denver.

1:23:36.679 --> 1:23:37.946
Tan and Fitness trainer

1:23:37.946 --> 1:23:39.382
was brutally attacked in her gym

1:23:39.382 --> 1:23:41.217
after weeks of a
cyber harassment.

1:23:41.217 --> 1:23:43.152
And she got it all on video.

1:23:43.186 --> 1:23:44.820
Joanna Kelley, a
Denver resident,

1:23:44.820 --> 1:23:46.389
told police for several weeks

1:23:46.389 --> 1:23:48.224
that a then unknown cyber bully

1:23:48.291 --> 1:23:50.025
just wouldn't leave her alone.

1:23:50.025 --> 1:23:51.860
Although she made
repeated reports,

1:23:51.860 --> 1:23:54.863
there wasn't enough evidence
to identify the suspect,

1:23:54.897 --> 1:23:58.201
that is until she ran away
from the man and into her gym,

1:23:58.201 --> 1:24:00.203
where he attacked her.
- Oh, God.

1:24:01.737 --> 1:24:03.372
(medical machinery beeps)

1:24:03.372 --> 1:24:04.907
You're really something else.

1:24:06.742 --> 1:24:07.976
- You are too kind.

1:24:11.046 --> 1:24:12.047
- You're my hero.

1:24:16.051 --> 1:24:16.885
- Mine too.

1:24:18.321 --> 1:24:19.588
- I have something to show you.

1:24:21.224 --> 1:24:22.558
Congratulations.

1:24:23.692 --> 1:24:25.094
I don't know how
many fitness trainers

1:24:25.094 --> 1:24:29.031
can say they have 1.5
million followers overnight.

1:24:29.064 --> 1:24:31.400
(chuckles)

1:24:42.345 --> 1:24:43.579
Can I get you anything?

1:24:46.582 --> 1:24:50.586
- Yeah, I'd kill for
some good coffee.

1:24:50.586 --> 1:24:52.087
- (chuckles) You got it.

1:24:53.256 --> 1:24:56.058
(knock on door)

1:24:56.091 --> 1:24:56.925
- Hello.

1:24:59.395 --> 1:25:01.063
Doc says you're
gonna be all right.

1:25:03.065 --> 1:25:04.533
(clears throat)

1:25:04.533 --> 1:25:06.869
- Well, I think I'll
go get that coffee now.

1:25:06.869 --> 1:25:08.704
- I could use some
coffee myself.

1:25:09.572 --> 1:25:11.039
I'll be right back.

1:25:14.143 --> 1:25:15.077
- Hey, Joe.

1:25:17.079 --> 1:25:20.082
- Hey. It's good
to see you smiling.

1:25:23.219 --> 1:25:27.723
Listen, I know you did what
you thought you had to do.

1:25:28.824 --> 1:25:31.059
But that was really stupid.

1:25:32.461 --> 1:25:34.630
- I don't want to lecture.

1:25:37.065 --> 1:25:39.302
- You're right. I'm sorry.

1:25:39.302 --> 1:25:41.237
Just seeing you laying
there like that.

1:25:43.339 --> 1:25:44.907
I didn't know if you
were gonna make it.

1:25:48.777 --> 1:25:50.679
- I thought you didn't
want me to take any crap.

1:25:50.679 --> 1:25:53.282
(bright music)

1:25:55.584 --> 1:25:57.420
(shutters click)

1:25:57.420 --> 1:25:58.987
- Nice.

1:25:58.987 --> 1:26:01.757
(phone vibrates)

1:26:01.790 --> 1:26:02.991
- Jo Kelley training.

1:26:02.991 --> 1:26:04.527
This is Allie. How
can I help you?

1:26:04.593 --> 1:26:05.928
- [Miss Avery]
This is Miss Avery.

1:26:06.795 --> 1:26:08.997
- Oh, hi, Miss Avery.

1:26:08.997 --> 1:26:12.501
You know, Jo is really busy
with a cover shoot right now.

1:26:12.535 --> 1:26:14.136
Is there anything I
can do to help you?

1:26:14.169 --> 1:26:15.771
- [Miss Avery] Well yes, I
wanted to set up a session

1:26:15.771 --> 1:26:17.940
for next week.
- Oh.

1:26:19.675 --> 1:26:20.509
Okay.

1:26:21.944 --> 1:26:22.778
You know what?

1:26:23.646 --> 1:26:25.714
I'm not seeing anything for...

1:26:29.685 --> 1:26:33.722
Well, it's looking like
a good eight months out.

1:26:33.789 --> 1:26:35.291
(shutter clicks)
- Nice work.

1:26:35.324 --> 1:26:36.459
Come take a look.

1:26:36.459 --> 1:26:38.727
(bright music)

1:26:38.727 --> 1:26:41.063
- Hey, I'm gonna grab lunch.

1:26:47.202 --> 1:26:50.038
(message beeps)

1:26:50.038 --> 1:26:52.708
(intense music)

1:27:18.734 --> 1:27:21.704
(mouse clicks)

1:27:21.704 --> 1:27:24.206
(slow music)

1:27:37.119 --> 1:27:42.124
* I've got things I need
to get off my chest *

1:27:44.460 --> 1:27:49.465
* Not get held up by
claims in business *

1:27:51.700 --> 1:27:56.705
* It starts with feeding
then you lose your head *

1:27:59.141 --> 1:28:04.079
* It moves back down till
it turns blue and red *

1:28:05.280 --> 1:28:09.618
* And you take my
heart, my woman *

1:28:13.121 --> 1:28:18.126
* I bet the same things
that you never doubt *

1:28:19.428 --> 1:28:24.433
* You take my horse, my homes

1:28:27.636 --> 1:28:32.641
* Like deja vu, gonna
get its ghost right now *

1:28:35.344 --> 1:28:40.349
* Ooh, ooh, ooh

1:28:42.651 --> 1:28:45.320
* Ooh, ooh, ooh

1:28:48.924 --> 1:28:51.594
(gentle music)
