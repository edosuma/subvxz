02:12.310 --> 02:14.477
Oh, okay, thank you, Kate.

02:14.479 --> 02:18.182
It crushed a can
like I've never seen.

02:18.184 --> 02:19.483
It was... it was insane.

02:20.620 --> 02:22.153
Yeah, come in!

02:22.155 --> 02:23.721
If that thing is, like,
a piece of shit...

02:23.723 --> 02:26.624
Hey, um,
how is the planning going

02:26.626 --> 02:27.791
for the anniversary party?

02:27.793 --> 02:28.792
Good.
Good?

02:28.794 --> 02:30.094
Yep. All set.

02:30.096 --> 02:31.496
Good or great?
Really great.

02:31.498 --> 02:33.665
Oh, oh, okay.
And you're gonna hate this.

02:33.667 --> 02:37.369
Will you call the distributors,
each one individually,

02:37.371 --> 02:38.803
and speak to someone there

02:38.805 --> 02:40.172
and make sure that they know
they're invited?

02:40.174 --> 02:41.506
You're, like, you know,

02:41.508 --> 02:42.507
the face and voice
of this brewery, so...

02:42.509 --> 02:44.243
Yeah.

02:44.245 --> 02:45.244
You know, they need
to make a connection with you,

02:45.246 --> 02:47.113
and that way, you know...

02:47.115 --> 02:48.314
I know it's a little political,
but if you did that for me,

02:48.316 --> 02:49.682
it would make me
very, very, very happy.

02:49.684 --> 02:51.551
Sure thing. Yep, sure.
I'll get on that.

02:51.553 --> 02:54.387
All right.
Oh, oh, um...

02:54.389 --> 02:56.556
Uh...

02:56.558 --> 02:57.724
That's it. That's it.

02:57.726 --> 02:59.593
Okay, thanks.
Okay, all right.

03:01.362 --> 03:03.864
Hey, what are you,
running through the warehouse?

03:03.866 --> 03:05.632
I have to go make
so many phone calls.

03:05.634 --> 03:08.368
Can I make beer instead,
and you go make phone calls?

03:08.370 --> 03:09.836
Uh, no, no.

03:09.838 --> 03:11.206
how are the eyes?

03:11.208 --> 03:12.807
They're... they're good,

03:12.809 --> 03:15.643
despite boiling wort
being thrown into them.

03:15.645 --> 03:17.378
Well, look,
I apologize about that.

03:17.380 --> 03:18.913
It's good.
I've been baptized.

03:18.915 --> 03:20.281
See ya.
Lunch?

03:20.283 --> 03:21.282
Yes, yes.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.551
Okay.

03:23.553 --> 03:26.589
Okay, Tom, I have to go.

03:26.591 --> 03:27.890
Yep, I'll see you there.

03:27.892 --> 03:30.326
Okay, thank you.

03:32.830 --> 03:34.163
Hey.
Hey!

03:34.165 --> 03:35.731
I've got some food for Kate.

03:35.733 --> 03:37.466
That is me.

03:37.468 --> 03:41.538
If you could
just sign this guy for me.

03:45.376 --> 03:46.876
Awesome.

03:46.878 --> 03:47.877
Thank you.

03:47.879 --> 03:48.878
Thanks.

03:48.880 --> 03:49.879
Enjoy.

03:49.881 --> 03:51.281
Hey, do you have a fridge?

03:51.283 --> 03:52.583
Do I have a fridge?

03:52.585 --> 03:53.818
'Cause you can have a magnet.

03:53.820 --> 03:55.820
A magnet, ooh.

03:55.822 --> 03:56.821
Yeah.

03:56.823 --> 03:57.922
I love Revolution Brewing.

03:57.924 --> 03:59.190
I really do.

03:59.192 --> 04:00.191
Thank you!
Thank you.

04:00.193 --> 04:01.225
We love you too.

04:01.227 --> 04:02.793
I love you too.

04:10.403 --> 04:11.603
Uh-oh.

04:11.605 --> 04:12.604
Security!

04:12.606 --> 04:13.605
Hey!

04:13.607 --> 04:14.740
Security!

04:14.742 --> 04:15.807
Ugh.

04:15.809 --> 04:17.809
Oh, we smell so bad!

04:19.346 --> 04:20.613
Look at this, some Greek salad?

04:20.615 --> 04:21.748
Eat it.
I fucking hate it.

04:21.750 --> 04:22.849
It's disgusting.

04:22.851 --> 04:24.417
I'm trying not to get scurvy.

04:24.419 --> 04:25.418
Boing!

04:25.420 --> 04:27.654
Come on, not my fucking beer!

04:27.656 --> 04:30.923
Oh, that's an expert
beer-tasting technique.

04:32.727 --> 04:33.727
Enjoy your fries.

04:33.729 --> 04:35.429
I'm still gonna eat.

04:35.431 --> 04:36.964
That doesn't...
that doesn't do anything.

04:36.966 --> 04:38.432
That doesn't do anything to me.

04:38.434 --> 04:39.767
Come out
drinking with us tonight.

04:39.769 --> 04:41.402
Okay, yeah.

04:41.404 --> 04:42.670
You're in?
Sure.

04:42.672 --> 04:44.438
Awesome.
Mm-hmm.

04:44.440 --> 04:45.874
They go,
"Oh, my name... my name is Jim.

04:45.876 --> 04:47.542
This is my wife, Carol."

04:47.544 --> 04:49.711
You went... "Oh, this is Carol.
That's my"...

04:49.713 --> 04:51.946
You don't need to know
their names.

04:51.948 --> 04:53.448
But so this guy comes up to me,

04:53.450 --> 04:55.016
and I know
he's gonna fuck with us.

04:55.018 --> 04:57.319
And so in my head, I think
about what my mother said,

04:57.321 --> 04:58.953
and I have the vision,

04:58.955 --> 05:00.790
like from, you know,
the voice of God.

05:00.792 --> 05:03.526
This guy's name is Chris Cook.

05:03.528 --> 05:06.028
And so I go,
"Hey, man, you're Chris Cook."

05:06.030 --> 05:07.630
That's not a Korean name,
though.

05:07.632 --> 05:09.965
No, he's not...
this is not the Korean.

05:09.967 --> 05:11.634
I thought
that it just didn't work.

05:11.636 --> 05:12.769
No, the guy's name was...

05:12.771 --> 05:14.338
Where did you get Chris Cook?

05:14.340 --> 05:15.939
It was a voice, the theory...
it was a voice...

05:15.941 --> 05:19.476
Hey!
Hey!

05:19.478 --> 05:20.477
You made it.

05:20.479 --> 05:21.712
Gentlemen.

05:21.714 --> 05:23.313
Everybody remembers Jill.
Hi.

05:23.315 --> 05:24.781
Good seeing you.
Good seeing you too.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.584
How's it goin'?
Good.

05:26.586 --> 05:28.720
What do you want to drink?
You want something to drink?

05:28.722 --> 05:29.987
Uh, yeah, yeah.

05:29.989 --> 05:31.422
Yeah, I will
have a Bell's Amber.

05:31.424 --> 05:34.025
Bell's Amber.
Bell's Amber.

05:34.027 --> 05:35.693
Thank you.

05:43.436 --> 05:44.436
There you are.

05:44.438 --> 05:46.772
Oh, thank you.

05:52.579 --> 05:54.481
If your party bus flips over,

05:54.483 --> 05:57.650
how long before you think
you get to go party foul?

05:57.652 --> 05:58.651
What?

05:58.653 --> 05:59.652
Would you shut up?

05:59.654 --> 06:00.987
Well, I'm just saying.

06:00.989 --> 06:02.756
Would you please,
for once in your life...

06:02.758 --> 06:04.457
Party foul.

06:04.459 --> 06:06.694
Once in your life,
right before you talk, Frank,

06:06.696 --> 06:08.429
just go,
"I'm not gonna talk."

06:11.333 --> 06:12.600
I'm thinking about heading out.

06:12.602 --> 06:13.768
Let's do one more beer.

06:13.770 --> 06:15.970
Oh, no, no, no,
you should stay.

06:15.972 --> 06:17.438
You should hang out with Frank.

06:17.440 --> 06:18.706
One more beer.
Oh, no, I'm fine.

06:18.708 --> 06:19.907
We'll split one.

06:19.909 --> 06:21.476
No, baby, I got to go.
I got to go.

06:21.478 --> 06:22.944
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm going for sure.

06:22.946 --> 06:24.646
I'm going for sure.
I'm gonna go with.

06:24.648 --> 06:25.947
Yeah?
Yes.

06:25.949 --> 06:27.716
Okay.

06:27.718 --> 06:28.784
Gentlemen.

06:28.786 --> 06:30.485
You out?
Good night.

06:30.487 --> 06:31.987
Good night, Kate.
We'll see you at work.

06:31.989 --> 06:33.890
Bye!

06:33.892 --> 06:36.526

Yeah?

07:57.181 --> 08:00.949
Yeah, we played pool
at the Empty Bottle.

08:00.951 --> 08:01.950
Oh, the Bottle.

08:01.952 --> 08:02.985

No, I've been to the Bottle.

08:07.791 --> 08:10.960
What'd you do today?

08:10.962 --> 08:13.696
I met with a couple of kids
at the studio

08:13.698 --> 08:15.665
that I think
are gonna do an album.

08:15.667 --> 08:17.767
Yeah, they got a pretty decent
little sound.

08:17.769 --> 08:19.569
They're kind of...

08:19.571 --> 08:23.841
a little bit freak rock,
a little noisy.

08:23.843 --> 08:25.776
But they have this girl
who plays the cello,

08:25.778 --> 08:27.878
and I think
that's supposed to be ironic,

08:27.880 --> 08:29.647
but I can't tell anymore.

08:29.649 --> 08:32.650
But, uh, so we'll just
stick a mic on her and go.

08:35.186 --> 08:36.988
You sure
you don't want a plate?

08:36.990 --> 08:39.691

What?

09:49.267 --> 09:51.034
Oh, I got something, and I...

09:51.036 --> 09:52.736
I forgot.

09:52.738 --> 09:55.572
I bought you something today.

09:55.574 --> 09:57.341
I'll be right back.
One sec.

10:05.951 --> 10:07.818
Uh, you might hate it.

10:07.820 --> 10:09.286
You'll prob...
you'll probably hate it.

10:09.288 --> 10:10.922
I won't hate it.

10:10.924 --> 10:12.691
But you might come around
and then love it.

10:12.693 --> 10:14.893
Book!

10:14.895 --> 10:17.996
What is it?

10:17.998 --> 10:21.166
That is back
when men wrote about God,

10:21.168 --> 10:22.934
pussy, and themselves.

10:22.936 --> 10:25.605
It's like, of all the sort of
fellow narcissists,

10:25.607 --> 10:27.707
that's the one.

10:27.709 --> 10:28.708
Thank you.

10:28.710 --> 10:30.176
Sure.

10:30.178 --> 10:31.978
You kind of remind me
a little bit of the hero.

10:31.980 --> 10:32.979
Really? Is she a...

10:32.981 --> 10:34.213
Yeah, in a weird way.

10:34.215 --> 10:35.281
It's he, but...
It's a he.

10:35.283 --> 10:37.685
It's thematic.

10:37.687 --> 10:38.786
Awesome.

10:38.788 --> 10:40.187
You're a kindred spirit.

10:40.189 --> 10:41.622
Thank you.

10:41.624 --> 10:44.124
You're a runner.

10:44.126 --> 10:46.393
You're a rabbit.

10:46.395 --> 10:47.895
I am a little bit
like a rabbit.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.730
You are.

10:54.103 --> 10:55.103
Damn it.

10:55.105 --> 10:58.173
I can't find my sock.

10:58.175 --> 11:01.209
You sure you don't want
to just spend the night?

11:01.211 --> 11:02.944
No, I have to be home
in the morning

11:02.946 --> 11:05.748
'cause I'm having
something delivered.

11:05.750 --> 11:07.083
But you should stay in bed.

11:07.085 --> 11:08.150
Go to sleep.

11:12.255 --> 11:14.256
All right,
how about I call you a car?

11:14.258 --> 11:15.725
No, 'cause I have my bike.

11:15.727 --> 11:17.259
I'm just gonna ride.

11:17.261 --> 11:19.296
Just throw it in the back
of the cab or something.

11:19.298 --> 11:20.330
I'll give you some money.

11:20.332 --> 11:22.199
No, thank you.

11:22.201 --> 11:23.333
I feel bad.

11:23.335 --> 11:26.303
Don't feel bad.

11:26.305 --> 11:27.838
I feel bad.

11:27.840 --> 11:29.439
Don't feel bad.

11:55.935 --> 11:57.402
No, really, really, really.

11:57.404 --> 11:58.438
Really?

11:59.975 --> 12:02.809
No! No!
You're gonna get me fired!

12:02.811 --> 12:03.810
Oh, gross!

12:03.812 --> 12:04.944
Sorry.

12:04.946 --> 12:06.246
Get out.
I'm leaving.

12:07.849 --> 12:08.848
Ow!

12:08.850 --> 12:10.150
Please, please, please.

12:10.152 --> 12:11.284
Stop it.

12:11.286 --> 12:12.887
Now you're just being mean.

12:12.889 --> 12:14.355
Okay. All right.

12:14.357 --> 12:17.892
So you don't need me
to do anything.

12:17.894 --> 12:21.195
I mean, no, if everything
is all taken care of,

12:21.197 --> 12:24.098
then I guess, you know,
we should be fine, I guess.

12:24.100 --> 12:25.467
Okay.
Yeah.

12:25.469 --> 12:27.035
Are you gonna be all right?

12:27.037 --> 12:30.505
I'm... I'm fine.

12:30.507 --> 12:31.506
Okay.

12:31.508 --> 12:32.741
Yeah.

12:32.743 --> 12:33.742
I like both.

12:33.744 --> 12:35.143
I like a short beard.

12:35.145 --> 12:36.878
I like... I like your beard...
Well, this...

12:36.880 --> 12:38.380
Like, if it was longer
than this,

12:38.382 --> 12:40.183
then I'd be worried
it would be like a hipster

12:40.185 --> 12:42.185
or homeless dot com
kind of situation.

12:42.187 --> 12:43.820
But this is an okay range.

12:43.822 --> 12:45.054
I like it.

12:45.056 --> 12:46.289
Hi, guys.
Hey, how are you?

12:46.291 --> 12:47.890
Hi. Good.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.225
You like nice.
Oh, thank you very much.

12:49.227 --> 12:50.993
This place is gorgeous.
Did you do most of this?

12:50.995 --> 12:52.061
Yeah, it looks awesome.
Did you do most of this?

12:52.063 --> 12:53.797
Yeah, I didn't do much.

12:53.799 --> 12:55.265
I just put some plants
in the growlers and the food...

12:55.267 --> 12:56.934
No, it looks amazing.

12:56.936 --> 12:58.302
Why are you so stressed?
It's going great.

12:58.304 --> 12:59.303
It's good, right?
It's great.

12:59.305 --> 13:00.838
Okay, good.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.472
The chocolate pretzels
are a humongous hit.

13:02.474 --> 13:04.441
Good, good. Great.
It's hot, sorry.

13:04.443 --> 13:05.977
It's so hot.

13:05.979 --> 13:07.979
Just encourages more drinking.
Yeah, exactly.

13:07.981 --> 13:09.147
I think it's good party plan.

13:09.149 --> 13:10.548
Ah! Sorry.

13:10.550 --> 13:12.383
Chris is here.
I'm gonna go get him.

13:12.385 --> 13:14.052
Okay.
I'll be right back.

13:14.054 --> 13:15.454
Bring him back over here,
all right?

13:15.455 --> 13:16.955
Okay.
Chris is her boyfriend?

13:16.957 --> 13:18.389
Chris is the boyfriend, yes.

13:18.391 --> 13:19.925
Baby.

13:19.927 --> 13:21.093
Hey.
Mwah.

13:21.095 --> 13:22.428
Welcome!

13:22.430 --> 13:24.129
I was just looking for you.
Thank you.

13:24.131 --> 13:25.130
Come in. Jess.

13:25.132 --> 13:28.100
Jessica, he's with me.

13:28.102 --> 13:29.101
Wow, this is great.

13:29.103 --> 13:30.102
This looks great.

13:30.104 --> 13:31.103
Did you do all of this?

13:31.105 --> 13:33.006
I did.
Wow.

13:33.008 --> 13:35.876
Wow, it's...
yeah, it's amazing.

13:35.878 --> 13:38.078
- It's a lot of work.
- Yeah.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.379
Here, I want you
to meet some people.

13:39.381 --> 13:40.513
You guys,
this is my boyfriend, Chris.

13:40.515 --> 13:42.349
Hey, how are you?

13:42.351 --> 13:44.084
Chris, this is Jim.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

13:44.086 --> 13:45.318
This is Dawn.
Hey, Jim. How are you?

13:45.320 --> 13:46.554
Pleasure.
Hi, nice to meet you.

13:46.556 --> 13:47.556
And this is Frank's wife.

13:47.557 --> 13:48.890
Frank.
Amy.

13:48.892 --> 13:50.391
Frank.
Hey, Frank's wife.

13:50.393 --> 13:51.492
I can't wait to meet him.

13:51.494 --> 13:53.361
Yeah, he's with Jim right now.

13:53.363 --> 13:54.362
You left him with Jim?

13:54.364 --> 13:56.163
Yeah.

13:56.165 --> 13:58.266
But, um, if I introduce you,
will you not be a dickhead?

13:58.268 --> 13:59.567
And don't call me names,

13:59.569 --> 14:01.203
and don't say anything stupid
or mean,

14:01.205 --> 14:03.205
and don't, like,
punch me in the face?

14:04.408 --> 14:06.341
Get off.

14:07.977 --> 14:09.444
All our equipment came in
from Canada.

14:09.446 --> 14:10.879
We had it shipped in,

14:10.881 --> 14:12.514
and we had it all rigged
and set up,

14:12.516 --> 14:14.584
and started brewing
about three months ago.

14:14.586 --> 14:16.085
Here you go. Good one.
Thank you.

14:16.087 --> 14:17.887
Uh, we'll be back.

14:17.889 --> 14:19.889
I'm just gonna introduce him
to some other people.

14:19.891 --> 14:21.024
Great to... great to meet you.

14:21.026 --> 14:22.325
Yeah.

14:25.162 --> 14:26.596
Well, then take the shoes off.

14:26.598 --> 14:28.499
No, no.
I'm... I'm such a shorty.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.234
Who cares?

14:30.236 --> 14:32.136
I don't want your friends
to know how short I am.

14:32.138 --> 14:33.504
Ha-ha!

14:33.506 --> 14:35.072
You're the weirdest.
It's a secret.

14:35.074 --> 14:36.307
It's a secret?

14:36.309 --> 14:37.308
All right, I won't tell anyone.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.943
Hey, guys.
Hi!

14:38.945 --> 14:40.177
This is Chris. This is Jill.
Hi, I'm Jill.

14:40.179 --> 14:41.246
Jill, how are you?
This is Luke.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.048
Nice to meet you.
Luke?

14:43.050 --> 14:44.449
Yes, Luke, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, Luke.

14:44.451 --> 14:45.450
Nice to meet you.
This is Callie.

14:45.452 --> 14:46.885
Hey, Callie.
Hi.

14:46.887 --> 14:48.019
This is Mike.
How are you? Chris.

14:48.021 --> 14:49.020
Hey. Mike.
Mike? Chris.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.188
It's everybody!

14:50.190 --> 14:51.556
Pleasure, yeah.
Nice to see you.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.024
This is his first time here.
Welcome, man.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.427
Hey, all jokes aside,

14:54.429 --> 14:56.195
we've heard
a lot of great things about you,

14:56.197 --> 14:57.430
and we're excited to have you.

14:57.432 --> 14:59.432
Really? Good.
That's great.

14:59.434 --> 15:01.133
Well, what do you think
of the beer, man?

15:01.135 --> 15:02.134
Um, well...

15:02.136 --> 15:05.237
Have a sip.

15:05.239 --> 15:06.605
Pressure's on now.

15:06.607 --> 15:07.941
Big reaction.

15:07.943 --> 15:08.942
What do you taste, sir?

15:08.944 --> 15:10.310
Can you taste the hops?

15:10.312 --> 15:11.979
Uh, I have to go take care
of something.

15:11.981 --> 15:13.447
I taste skinned knees and...

15:13.449 --> 15:15.182
I'll be right back.
Will you be cool here?

15:15.184 --> 15:16.683
I will. I will.
Jelly sandwiches and...

15:16.685 --> 15:18.118
Jelly sandwiches!

15:18.120 --> 15:19.953
Dark clouds of puberty
on the horizon.

15:19.955 --> 15:21.489
No, I don't know.

15:30.366 --> 15:32.266
Where do you...
where do you teach?

15:32.268 --> 15:33.534
I teach at Orr.

15:33.536 --> 15:35.604
I teach Special Ed.

15:35.606 --> 15:37.539
Oh. Oh, wow.

15:37.541 --> 15:39.274
Yeah.

15:39.276 --> 15:42.344
Yeah, that's... so you really...
you really teach.

15:42.346 --> 15:43.345
I guess, yeah.

15:43.347 --> 15:44.413
I mean... yeah.

15:44.415 --> 15:46.181
You have... yeah.
Yeah.

15:46.183 --> 15:47.984
You have a Master's?

15:47.986 --> 15:51.054
Uh, I was teaching
while I was getting my Master's.

15:51.056 --> 15:52.989
There was a program,
and... yeah.

15:52.991 --> 15:56.226
That's, um...
I find that really impressive.

15:56.228 --> 15:58.595
Well, thank you. Yeah.

16:02.534 --> 16:03.534
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.

16:03.536 --> 16:04.535
Sorry.
Oh, I apologize.

16:04.537 --> 16:06.103
Oh, pardon me.

16:06.105 --> 16:07.538
Oh, I didn't realize
that was you.

16:07.540 --> 16:09.440
Oh, what a gross-looking plate.
I am so hungry.

16:09.442 --> 16:10.708
I have not eaten anything
all day.

16:10.710 --> 16:11.742
It's all hot mustard, Kate.

16:11.744 --> 16:13.210
That's all I need.

16:13.212 --> 16:16.615
You know, I read something,
ah...

16:16.617 --> 16:18.617
I think Camus wrote about

16:18.619 --> 16:22.120
Sisyphus pushing the boulder up,
you know, the hill?

16:22.122 --> 16:24.723
And he always pictured him
smiling?

16:24.725 --> 16:27.092
Um...

16:27.094 --> 16:29.362
You know, as opposed
to a punishment thing,

16:29.364 --> 16:32.165
and I feel that sometimes
things that are really hard

16:32.167 --> 16:34.400
can be...
can be really rewarding

16:34.402 --> 16:38.104
because they're hard, you know?

16:39.107 --> 16:40.373
Chris is a great guy.

16:40.375 --> 16:41.607
He is, right?
He's a great guy.

16:41.609 --> 16:43.210
He told me about you guys,
though,

16:43.212 --> 16:45.112
that weird thing
that happened the other night.

16:45.114 --> 16:46.580
You're a dick.
He didn't say anything.

16:46.582 --> 16:48.048
No, he said you're a...

16:48.050 --> 16:49.516
Have fun. Good-bye.
All right.

16:53.288 --> 16:54.755
Thank you.
Thanks for showing me that.

16:54.757 --> 16:56.391
Yeah.
Hey, man, it was really fun.

16:56.393 --> 16:57.725
You get a tour?
Yeah, I did. I did, yeah.

16:57.727 --> 16:58.760
I gave him a tour
of the whole place.

16:58.762 --> 17:00.261
Yeah, it was kind of awesome.

17:00.263 --> 17:01.463
That's cool.
He got into it.

17:01.465 --> 17:04.732
Yeah, um,
who cleans all this up?

17:04.733 --> 17:06.634
You're looking at
the cleaning crew right now.

17:06.636 --> 17:08.236
All right, can I help?

17:08.238 --> 17:09.605
We're gonna clean it up.
You guys go.

17:09.607 --> 17:11.140
Really?

17:11.142 --> 17:12.775
Yeah, I talked to Mike
and Frank and the guys.

17:12.777 --> 17:14.143
We're gonna do it.

17:14.145 --> 17:15.277
You set it up.
We'll clean it.

17:15.279 --> 17:16.311
We'll stick around if...

17:16.314 --> 17:17.413
No, you guys, honestly, go.

17:17.415 --> 17:18.547
You've done enough.

17:18.549 --> 17:19.647
See what I just did?
Yeah?

17:19.650 --> 17:20.816
See that?

17:20.818 --> 17:22.251
Thank you.

17:22.252 --> 17:23.453
All right, okay.

17:23.454 --> 17:24.621
I won't say no.
Good to see you.

17:24.623 --> 17:25.821
It was so good to see you.

17:25.824 --> 17:27.624
You too.
I'll see you soon.

17:27.626 --> 17:29.626
Hey, it was a real pleasure.
Yeah, it's awesome.

17:29.628 --> 17:31.394
Congratulations on, you know,
the thing.

17:31.396 --> 17:32.629
All right,
I'll see you at work.

17:32.631 --> 17:34.397
Really great to meet you.

17:34.399 --> 17:36.567
I heard that we might stop by
your tasting this weekend.

17:36.569 --> 17:38.402
Oh, yeah.
No, I hope you do.

17:38.404 --> 17:40.505
I'm there from noon to 2:00,
so whenever you guys want.

17:40.507 --> 17:41.739
Ice cream brunch.
I love it.

17:41.741 --> 17:42.740
Good night, guys.
Bye.

17:42.742 --> 17:44.675
Good night.

17:44.677 --> 17:46.277
I'm not cleaning.

17:46.279 --> 17:47.645
You're cleaning.
I'm not cleaning.

17:47.647 --> 17:51.416
Oh, you're cleaning.

17:51.418 --> 17:53.218
I'm not lifting a finger.

17:55.089 --> 17:56.388
Yeah. No, absolutely.

17:56.390 --> 17:58.357
It's...
we have one, two...

17:58.359 --> 18:01.460
I have nine tastings
this month,

18:01.462 --> 18:02.628
but I can put you in.

18:02.630 --> 18:04.731
Kate...

18:04.733 --> 18:06.299
Jill's outside.

18:06.301 --> 18:07.567
I'm ready.
I just have to finish.

18:07.569 --> 18:08.735
Then let's go.
I'm going.

18:08.737 --> 18:11.838
But I can do this next week.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.406
Not this weekend.

18:13.408 --> 18:16.744
Nope,
I have a festival this weekend.

18:16.746 --> 18:18.479
But I can do this next week,

18:18.481 --> 18:20.581
and I'll bring whatever
year-ends we have available.

18:20.583 --> 18:21.815
Okay?
Thank you.

18:21.817 --> 18:23.184
I'll call you on Monday.

18:23.186 --> 18:24.351
Okay, bye.

18:27.656 --> 18:29.423
Have wallet...

18:38.534 --> 18:40.669
All right, I got it.

18:48.912 --> 18:50.179
All right.

18:50.181 --> 18:51.480
Come on in.

18:51.482 --> 18:53.149
Why don't you
put the groceries down,

18:53.151 --> 18:55.251
and we'll just leave 'em,
and...

18:57.222 --> 18:58.322
Wow.

18:58.324 --> 18:59.823
Big reveal.

18:59.825 --> 19:01.692
Oh, yeah, I can't
really take responsibility

19:01.694 --> 19:03.393
for the decoration.

19:03.395 --> 19:05.262
My cousin and her kids
kind of come up here a lot.

19:05.264 --> 19:06.630
No, I love it.
She likes patterns.

19:06.632 --> 19:08.265
Most of it
really hasn't been changed

19:08.267 --> 19:10.802
probably in 40 years, either.

19:10.804 --> 19:12.604
Um...

19:17.543 --> 19:18.943
All right.

19:18.945 --> 19:21.879
Here's a bathroom
if anybody needs it.

19:21.881 --> 19:25.251
Um, I expect you might.

19:25.253 --> 19:27.953
It is... we're on a septic
line,

19:27.955 --> 19:31.657
so try not to put any...
down that thing.

19:31.659 --> 19:33.225
Great.

19:33.227 --> 19:34.660
You guys are gonna be
in this room here.

19:34.662 --> 19:35.928
Where do I put my tampons?

19:35.930 --> 19:37.496
You keep them in a bag.

19:37.498 --> 19:38.498
Is this us?

19:38.500 --> 19:39.866
This is you.

19:39.868 --> 19:42.302
What? In a cabin,
you keep them in a bag?

19:42.304 --> 19:43.870
Why don't you two settle in,

19:43.872 --> 19:45.739
clean up
if you want to clean up,

19:45.741 --> 19:47.907
and we'll go
put the groceries away,

19:47.909 --> 19:49.709
and then, you know,

19:49.711 --> 19:51.812
if you want to crack a beer
or two or something.

19:51.814 --> 19:53.247
Oh, yes, please.

19:53.249 --> 19:54.582
Yeah, welcome,
but just, you know,

19:54.584 --> 19:55.750
make yourself at home, okay?

19:55.752 --> 19:57.418
Thank you, man.
Great.

19:57.420 --> 20:00.588
What is that?

20:00.590 --> 20:01.889
It's really cute.

20:01.891 --> 20:03.524
Yeah, it is.

20:03.526 --> 20:05.327
I've got you alone in a cabin
with this thing.

20:05.329 --> 20:06.428
How's the bed?

20:06.430 --> 20:09.364
Uh...

20:09.366 --> 20:10.365
Oh, it's squishy.

20:10.367 --> 20:11.466
It is?

20:11.468 --> 20:14.503
It's really... oop.

20:14.505 --> 20:17.606
I feel like
we're gonna break it.

20:17.608 --> 20:19.042
We're good.

20:37.429 --> 20:38.429
Hi.

20:38.431 --> 20:40.464
Morning.

20:42.301 --> 20:43.867
You think I could make eggs
or something?

20:43.869 --> 20:46.938
Yeah, sure.

20:46.940 --> 20:49.474
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

20:52.578 --> 20:56.715
For a man who has everything,
he's only got little bowls.

20:56.717 --> 20:57.882
Sorry.

20:57.884 --> 20:59.652
That was a terrible joke.

21:01.822 --> 21:03.556
Eggs?

21:03.558 --> 21:05.658
Sure, yeah.

21:20.041 --> 21:21.942
You close with your parents?

21:21.944 --> 21:25.045
Sort of.
Sort of.

21:25.047 --> 21:26.080
I mean, we talk.

21:26.082 --> 21:27.081
I talk to them.

21:27.083 --> 21:29.617
Yeah.

21:29.619 --> 21:32.086
We don't hate each other.

21:32.088 --> 21:34.055
That's a positive.

21:34.057 --> 21:35.990
Are you?

21:37.993 --> 21:39.528
Hey!

21:39.530 --> 21:40.929
Hey!

21:40.931 --> 21:42.598
You're up.

21:47.370 --> 21:48.771
You look great.

21:48.773 --> 21:50.072
Oh, thank you.

21:50.074 --> 21:51.540
Here, let me help you up.

21:51.542 --> 21:53.510
Oh, merci.
How are ya?

21:53.512 --> 21:55.845
Got a mouthful of hair
just then, sorry. Sorry.

21:55.847 --> 21:58.415
Good. I prefer it.
Good.

21:58.417 --> 21:59.582
Hey. Morning.

21:59.584 --> 22:00.583
Thanks for having us.

22:00.585 --> 22:02.419
Sure. My pleasure.

22:02.421 --> 22:04.487
Just coming to see if I can
interest you guys in a hike,

22:04.489 --> 22:05.822
a little trail hike.

22:05.824 --> 22:07.591
Will it offend you at all
if I say no?

22:07.593 --> 22:08.793
Absolutely not.

22:08.795 --> 22:09.927
No way, then.
I'm not going.

22:09.929 --> 22:11.962
If you don't mind.

22:11.964 --> 22:13.531
Doesn't offend me at all.
Awesome.

22:13.533 --> 22:16.033
Yeah, maybe... how about you?
You want to go?

22:16.035 --> 22:18.636
I...

22:26.579 --> 22:30.515
Probably spent the first month
trying to figure out

22:30.517 --> 22:33.953
what was in it for her,
you know.

22:33.955 --> 22:36.656
But I guess you have to take
a person at their word

22:36.658 --> 22:38.124
that...

22:40.427 --> 22:43.062
They're actually into you,
you know?

22:43.064 --> 22:44.797
I don't know.

22:44.799 --> 22:48.135
It's hard to figure women out.

22:48.137 --> 22:49.136
Well...

22:49.138 --> 22:50.604
Still working on it.

22:50.606 --> 22:52.673
I mean,
you're an interesting...

22:54.009 --> 22:55.642
Polite gentleman.

22:58.180 --> 23:00.615
I'm sure that's...

23:00.617 --> 23:02.817
That's a good way to put it.
I'm sure that's a big factor.

23:02.819 --> 23:04.853
No, that's a lovely...
that's a lovely way to put it.

23:04.855 --> 23:06.120
Well,
I'll bet a lot of people...

23:06.122 --> 23:07.121
I'm probably a little...

23:07.123 --> 23:08.756
Interesting gentlemen

23:08.758 --> 23:10.592
don't necessarily come in there
all the time.

23:10.594 --> 23:12.694
I'm probably somewhere
on the Asperger's spectrum.

23:12.696 --> 23:15.431
That's probably
a little closer to it.

23:15.433 --> 23:16.699
All right, you ready?
Yes.

23:16.701 --> 23:18.200
What's your first bet?

23:18.202 --> 23:20.002
What's a good first bet?
$5?

23:20.004 --> 23:21.604
We're gonna...
way more than that.

23:21.606 --> 23:22.972
Let's say $100 minimum
at this table.

23:22.974 --> 23:23.973
This is VIP.

23:23.975 --> 23:25.174
I don't have $100.

23:25.176 --> 23:27.511
Well,
the house will give you $1,000.

23:27.513 --> 23:28.845
Not give you, but as a credit.

23:28.847 --> 23:31.081
Oh, I was like,
"I love gambling!"

23:31.083 --> 23:32.682
Yeah, you just went...

23:32.684 --> 23:35.018
No, the house
will spot you $1,000,

23:35.020 --> 23:36.520
because we know
you're good for it.

23:36.522 --> 23:38.121
Great.
So $100.

23:38.123 --> 23:39.856
Okay, I shouldn't...
$100.

23:39.858 --> 23:41.626
Yeah, you don't want to go
$1,000 to start.

23:41.628 --> 23:42.827
You want to go more?

23:42.829 --> 23:44.028
No, I'll start with $100.

23:44.030 --> 23:46.597
Okay.
Good luck to you.

23:46.599 --> 23:48.666
A nine versus a face.

23:48.668 --> 23:51.669
Hit me.

23:51.671 --> 23:52.937
We got a nine and an eight.

23:52.939 --> 23:55.674
That's a hard 17.

23:55.676 --> 23:56.975
What do you say?

23:56.977 --> 24:00.078
Hit me.
You want to hit with a 17?

24:00.080 --> 24:01.580
Yeah, hit me.
That is a very bold...

24:01.582 --> 24:03.015
And a bust, ma'am.
That is a 23.

24:03.017 --> 24:04.583
We're really sorry.
You're down $100.

24:04.585 --> 24:05.918
That's okay.

24:05.920 --> 24:09.222
I was gonna say,
I wonder sometimes,

24:09.224 --> 24:13.860
you know, if I'd have met
somebody like her or you

24:13.862 --> 24:18.197
or, you know, somebody
that had that kind of...

24:18.199 --> 24:21.602
thing going on 15 years ago...

24:23.638 --> 24:24.972
Well, you know what?
I probably did.

24:24.974 --> 24:27.908
I probably did meet somebody
like that.

24:27.910 --> 24:30.811
And I probably
wasn't paying attention.

24:39.222 --> 24:42.190
You have lost every hand.

24:42.192 --> 24:44.793
You are down $1,000.

24:44.795 --> 24:46.261
I am yet to see my cards.

24:46.263 --> 24:49.765
Will the casino kindly give me
another $1,000?

24:49.767 --> 24:51.167
I'll tell you...
I'm good for it.

24:51.169 --> 24:52.602
Kate, I...

24:52.604 --> 24:53.603
This is like college.

24:53.605 --> 24:55.538
I have never done this before,

24:55.540 --> 24:57.673
but I'll talk to the pit boss.

24:57.675 --> 24:59.108
We'll give you another $1,000!

24:59.110 --> 25:00.276
Yes! Thank you.

25:00.278 --> 25:01.577
You better win it back, kid.

25:01.579 --> 25:03.680
'Cause if you lose $2,000,

25:03.682 --> 25:05.649
I personally
am gonna bust your legs.

25:05.651 --> 25:06.783
I'm all warmed up now.

25:06.785 --> 25:07.884
How much?

25:07.886 --> 25:09.219
$100.

25:09.221 --> 25:10.754
That low right now?

25:10.756 --> 25:12.222
You're right.
Let's get weird.

25:12.224 --> 25:13.890
$300?

25:13.892 --> 25:15.325
Now we're talking.
Good luck, ma'am.

25:15.327 --> 25:17.328
I really mean that.
I do work off tips.

25:17.330 --> 25:19.163
This thing's amazing.
Where'd you get that?

25:19.165 --> 25:22.867
It kind of came
with my... my pack.

25:22.869 --> 25:23.868
It's fantastic.

25:23.870 --> 25:24.869
It's a little... yeah.

25:24.871 --> 25:26.170
It's a little dinky,

25:26.172 --> 25:28.106
but it's got the tarp
underneath.

25:28.108 --> 25:30.643
Yeah, it's, like, waterproof.
So it's, like, heavy-duty.

25:30.645 --> 25:32.011
It's perfect.
Absolutely perfect.

25:32.013 --> 25:33.946
Yeah.

25:33.948 --> 25:34.947
Oh, wow.

25:34.949 --> 25:36.849
Okay.

25:36.851 --> 25:41.120
I didn't think I brought...
was glasses for the wine.

25:41.122 --> 25:42.989
But we can probably
just swig out of the bottle.

25:42.991 --> 25:44.624
Are you cool with that?

25:44.626 --> 25:46.960
No, no.
I'm happy to see this.

25:46.962 --> 25:49.329
I've... I've been
kind of dreading this,

25:49.331 --> 25:52.198
'cause I felt
like you were so impressed

25:52.200 --> 25:54.367
by my outdoorsy-ness.

25:54.369 --> 25:55.602
Yeah?

25:55.604 --> 25:56.671
And, um...

25:56.673 --> 25:57.905
Uh, this is actually...

25:57.907 --> 25:59.840
Are you fucking kidding me?

25:59.842 --> 26:01.075
Are you kidding me with that?

26:01.077 --> 26:02.209
I know.
It's embarrassing.

26:02.211 --> 26:03.377
Who are you?

26:03.379 --> 26:05.913
It's... I'm a bourgeois pig.

26:05.915 --> 26:07.948
That is... that is gorgeous.

26:07.950 --> 26:09.383
Look at that.
Oh, my God.

26:09.385 --> 26:11.687
I know. It's got,
like, silverware and...

26:11.689 --> 26:12.721
Nah, that's great.

26:12.723 --> 26:14.189
It has a cheese board.

26:14.191 --> 26:16.024
You saved the day.
No, you just saved the day.

26:16.026 --> 26:17.025
That's fantastic.

26:17.027 --> 26:18.960
Now I'm fine.

26:18.962 --> 26:20.696
I love it.

26:20.698 --> 26:23.399
Yeah, I thought,
"I'll use this all the time."

26:23.401 --> 26:26.769
Jill, you're not
fucking around, are you?

26:26.771 --> 26:29.205
But this is actually the first
time I've gotten to use it,

26:29.207 --> 26:30.973
so thank you.

26:30.975 --> 26:33.643
I'm honored.

26:33.645 --> 26:34.744
All right.

26:34.746 --> 26:36.179
Here's to not fucking around.

26:36.181 --> 26:37.748
Cheers.
Cheers.

26:37.750 --> 26:39.316
Can I get rid of these onions?
Is that fair?

26:39.318 --> 26:40.918
No, that's part of it.

26:40.920 --> 26:42.686
All right, let's have
one humongous sandwich,

26:42.688 --> 26:44.354
and we'll cut it in half.

26:44.356 --> 26:46.323
We won't use mayo.
That's a perfect compromise.

26:47.393 --> 26:49.893
This is the best sandwich ever.

26:49.895 --> 26:51.229
Wait.

26:51.231 --> 26:53.031
Can we get this disgustingness
off the top?

26:53.033 --> 26:55.366
Yeah.

26:55.368 --> 26:57.202
I don't know
if I put enough mustard on.

26:57.204 --> 26:59.337
You have to put
a lot of mustard on.

27:01.807 --> 27:03.174
I feel like I might...

27:03.176 --> 27:04.443
may be
about to embarrass myself.

27:04.445 --> 27:06.746
My heart's beating really fast.

27:06.748 --> 27:09.281
Um...

27:09.283 --> 27:12.351
How come?

27:12.353 --> 27:14.720
Is that just me?

27:14.722 --> 27:16.689
Maybe that's just me.

27:16.691 --> 27:18.024
Sorry.

27:20.862 --> 27:22.462
How come?

27:22.464 --> 27:23.764
What's going on?

27:23.766 --> 27:25.165
Um...

27:28.302 --> 27:30.838
No, I just had, like,
a nervous feeling.

27:30.840 --> 27:34.208
Um, but that just might be...

27:35.344 --> 27:38.012
That just might be all me.

27:49.225 --> 27:50.859
Oh, no, don't do that.

27:50.861 --> 27:52.294
Don't do that.

27:54.865 --> 27:56.398
We're even.

27:56.400 --> 27:57.432
Yeah, all right.

27:57.434 --> 27:59.169
We're even.
Okay.

27:59.171 --> 28:01.838
Allow the moment to be even.

28:01.840 --> 28:03.139
You don't say soy cheese.

28:03.141 --> 28:04.374
I don't say mayo.

28:04.376 --> 28:06.476
We're adults.

28:06.478 --> 28:07.977
Oh, you are the worst.

28:07.979 --> 28:09.279
Luckily I caught it.

28:10.782 --> 28:11.782
Look at you.

28:11.784 --> 28:13.050
You're a pirate.

28:50.157 --> 28:52.159
That help?

29:02.971 --> 29:05.406
Okay, go!

29:07.310 --> 29:08.610
Oh!

29:15.985 --> 29:16.985
Ah, fuck.

29:16.987 --> 29:17.986
Here.
Okay.

29:17.988 --> 29:19.555
10:00.

29:19.557 --> 29:20.923
Oh.

29:27.397 --> 29:28.964
You broke my finger.

29:33.872 --> 29:35.605
Don't even think about it!

29:35.607 --> 29:37.908
Come on!

29:45.616 --> 29:47.218
Hey, doing okay?

29:47.220 --> 29:49.020
Mm-hmm. You?

29:49.022 --> 29:50.655
Good.

30:34.302 --> 30:36.270
Oh.
Let me give you this.

30:36.272 --> 30:39.373
Oh, thanks.

30:39.375 --> 30:41.977
You don't...
I don't need it if...

30:41.979 --> 30:43.979
No, it's fine, I made a...

30:43.981 --> 30:45.013
It's fine.

30:45.015 --> 30:46.481
Yeah.

30:55.092 --> 30:57.426
Are you gonna do that
the whole time?

30:57.428 --> 30:59.128
I might, yeah.

30:59.130 --> 31:00.629
I might.

31:00.631 --> 31:02.465
I want to see where you are.

31:02.467 --> 31:03.466
Good part.

31:03.468 --> 31:04.467
Do you like it?

31:04.469 --> 31:06.402
I do.

31:25.090 --> 31:26.657
Remember, jacks and jokers.

31:26.659 --> 31:29.994
Okay.

31:29.996 --> 31:31.329
No!

31:31.331 --> 31:32.597
'Cause if you hit accidentally,

31:32.599 --> 31:33.965
you have to get punished for it.

31:33.967 --> 31:34.967
No!

31:34.969 --> 31:36.702
Ah, damn it. Oh, fuck!

31:36.704 --> 31:38.203
That's a seven!

31:38.205 --> 31:40.272
All right,
so you get all those,

31:40.274 --> 31:41.273
and I get punished.

31:41.275 --> 31:43.108
I decide.

31:43.110 --> 31:44.276
That's right.

31:44.278 --> 31:46.045
When we started,
you said seven.

31:46.047 --> 31:47.747
Faster, faster, faster.

31:47.749 --> 31:51.317
Faster, faster. Faster!

31:51.319 --> 31:52.752
Ah!

31:55.223 --> 31:56.523
Which one do you want to do?

31:56.525 --> 31:58.224
You want to deal,
or you want to slap?

31:58.226 --> 31:59.225
I want you to deal.

31:59.227 --> 32:00.226
No, I want you to deal.

32:00.228 --> 32:01.562
Okay.

32:01.564 --> 32:03.431
Five seconds on the deal.

32:03.433 --> 32:04.598
I'll do the first three.

32:04.600 --> 32:05.599
You do the last one.

32:05.601 --> 32:06.600
Okay, okay, okay.

32:06.602 --> 32:07.701
Okay, ready?

32:07.703 --> 32:08.702
Do you feel good?

32:08.704 --> 32:11.539
Yeah, I'm ready.

32:11.541 --> 32:13.040
So is that what you choose
to do?

32:13.042 --> 32:14.375
Yes.
Then do this for the cameras.

32:14.377 --> 32:16.011
Oh.

32:16.013 --> 32:17.479
There's a camera above us
at all times,

32:17.481 --> 32:19.614
so you go like this,
and if you want to... okay.

32:19.616 --> 32:21.616
If you want to hit,
you go like this.

32:21.618 --> 32:23.385
And then you clear your hands

32:23.387 --> 32:24.653
to make sure
you're not stealing chips.

32:24.655 --> 32:26.655
Shouldn't you hit on the 14?

32:26.657 --> 32:28.724
No, 'cause you have
to think about what I'm playing.

32:28.726 --> 32:30.259
Not against a three.
Okay.

32:30.261 --> 32:31.727
So what would you like to do,
ma'am?

32:31.729 --> 32:33.563
I'll stay.
That's a very smart stay.

32:33.565 --> 32:35.131
That's a bad card for you.

32:35.133 --> 32:36.432
Now I have an eight.

32:36.434 --> 32:38.267
Now I have an 11.

32:38.269 --> 32:39.602
Now I have an 18.

32:39.604 --> 32:42.272
You lost that hand, that's...
hey!

32:42.274 --> 32:43.273
Are we being...
Sorry.

32:43.275 --> 32:44.475
Are we being way too loud?

32:44.477 --> 32:46.777
No, no.
No, you guys are fine.

32:46.779 --> 32:48.445
I was just coming to hang out.

32:48.447 --> 32:50.180
Are you saying
we're totally fine,

32:50.182 --> 32:51.515
but we're being way too loud?

32:51.517 --> 32:52.549
No, no, he's asleep.

32:52.551 --> 32:53.584
He got me drunk...

32:53.586 --> 32:54.585
Oh.
I'm sorry.

32:54.587 --> 32:56.287
And I lost so badly.

32:56.289 --> 32:58.089
And she's a total lightweight.
Here, drink this.

32:58.091 --> 32:59.491
And then he was beating me up.

32:59.493 --> 33:00.825
Are you drinking or...
I'll get my own.

33:00.827 --> 33:02.560
Deal.

33:02.562 --> 33:04.429
Okay, you're up $100.
What would you like to do?

33:04.431 --> 33:06.564
Do you guys need anything?
Yeah, let's have another.

33:06.566 --> 33:08.099
Let's just get a couple
on the table.

33:08.101 --> 33:09.168
Okay.

33:09.170 --> 33:10.302
Okay, so you lost that hand.

33:10.304 --> 33:11.303
You're down 100 bucks.

33:11.305 --> 33:12.538
She saw me lose.

33:12.540 --> 33:14.173
It's fine.
Okay.

33:14.175 --> 33:16.475
She lost
a lot of money earlier.

33:20.547 --> 33:24.217
All right.

33:24.219 --> 33:27.154
Why are you so good
at blackjack?

33:27.156 --> 33:28.755
'Cause when I was younger,

33:28.757 --> 33:31.791
I used to work on
the riverboats in the casinos.

33:31.793 --> 33:33.426
What?

33:33.428 --> 33:35.428
Yeah, my family,
we all played cards growing up.

33:35.430 --> 33:38.166
So when I was, like,
19 or 20 or whatever,

33:38.168 --> 33:39.867
my buddy got me a job,
or an interview,

33:39.869 --> 33:41.502
with this Chinese guy

33:41.504 --> 33:44.105
who ran a company
called "Network Management."

33:45.408 --> 33:47.475
Which is just, like,
a fake company.

33:47.477 --> 33:48.476
And then I got the job.

33:48.478 --> 33:50.145
It was an hourly wage.

33:50.147 --> 33:52.147
And he sent me on the boats
with 10,000 bucks

33:52.149 --> 33:53.882
for eight-hour shifts.

33:53.884 --> 33:57.119
I just played, you know,
with the company's money.

33:57.121 --> 33:59.354
So I was just a worker,

33:59.356 --> 34:01.790
but my game was,
you know, cards.

34:01.792 --> 34:04.827
That's crazy.
Yeah.

34:04.829 --> 34:06.496
Should we go have a smoke?

34:06.498 --> 34:08.598
You want to sit outside?
Okay.

34:08.600 --> 34:10.900
You want to?
Yeah.

34:10.902 --> 34:13.268
I don't want to wake her up.

34:22.547 --> 34:24.447
Here, I'll grab that.

34:24.449 --> 34:25.882
That's the problem
with heartbreak,

34:25.885 --> 34:27.818
is that to you,
it's like an atomic bomb,

34:27.820 --> 34:30.422
and to the world,
it's just really cliché,

34:30.424 --> 34:32.489
because, in the end,
we all have the same experience.

34:32.492 --> 34:34.926
But it's just you and me.

34:34.928 --> 34:38.463
I was madly,
madly in love with him,

34:38.465 --> 34:42.467
and we were total soul mates
and totally in love.

34:42.469 --> 34:46.539
And then he said,

34:46.541 --> 34:50.775
"I think maybe
we should just not."

34:50.777 --> 34:54.313
I think he said something
along the lines of,

34:54.315 --> 34:55.681
"I think we should, uh"...

34:55.683 --> 34:57.317
and he's not, like,
a football player,

34:57.319 --> 34:59.286
so this is a weird thing
for him to say...

34:59.288 --> 35:01.855
"I think we should take a knee
on this romance stuff."

35:01.857 --> 35:03.423
What does that mean?
That's so lame.

35:03.425 --> 35:04.925
I actually had to ask somebody.

35:04.927 --> 35:07.261
I was like,
"Is 'take a knee' a good thing?"

35:07.263 --> 35:08.262
No.

35:08.264 --> 35:09.596
No.
No.

35:09.598 --> 35:11.599
You've obviously
got a lot of love,

35:11.601 --> 35:12.967
so that's there.

35:12.969 --> 35:15.403
Some people don't.
Some people are snakes.

35:15.405 --> 35:17.605
And you're fun.

35:17.607 --> 35:19.807
And if Chris is lucky...

35:21.710 --> 35:22.777
You know, you have babies

35:22.779 --> 35:24.513
and do all that good stuff

35:24.515 --> 35:29.285
and live in this house
or a house equivalent to this.

35:29.287 --> 35:32.421
Yeah, you guys could come over
and play bridge.

35:32.423 --> 35:33.422
Fuckin' pass.

35:35.226 --> 35:37.259
By the way, I'm not doing
more double dates, either.

35:37.261 --> 35:38.561
This was fun.

35:38.563 --> 35:39.696
You love it.

35:39.698 --> 35:42.699
No, I'm having a good time.

35:42.701 --> 35:44.868
You know what I want to do,
Kate?

35:44.870 --> 35:45.969
Mm?

35:45.971 --> 35:47.003
If you don't want to do it,

35:47.005 --> 35:50.307
this is your chance to get out.

35:50.309 --> 35:51.475
Okay.

35:51.477 --> 35:53.978
I want to make a huge fire.

35:53.980 --> 35:55.446
I'm good at making fires.

35:55.448 --> 35:57.548
I can do it.

35:57.550 --> 36:00.851
And we'll sit by the fire
and relax on the beach.

36:00.853 --> 36:03.954
And fall asleep
on the fucking sand.

36:03.956 --> 36:05.891
And if we don't fall asleep...

36:05.893 --> 36:07.993
because there's a good chance
it's too uncomfortable

36:07.995 --> 36:09.728
to fall asleep...

36:09.730 --> 36:10.962
we'll put the fire out,
and we'll go to bed.

36:10.964 --> 36:12.364
Okay.

36:12.366 --> 36:13.432
Do you want to do that?
Yes.

36:13.434 --> 36:14.700
Does that sound fun to you?

36:14.702 --> 36:16.468
Yes.
Are you just saying that?

36:16.470 --> 36:17.736
Do you really think
it sounds fun?

36:17.738 --> 36:18.871
I think it sounds really fun.

36:18.873 --> 36:20.340
Are you just saying that,

36:20.342 --> 36:22.008
or do you really think
it sounds fun?

36:22.010 --> 36:24.477
I think it sounds really fun.
Okay, then we'll do that.

36:24.479 --> 36:26.646
What about
if we don't fall asleep

36:26.648 --> 36:27.814
and we stay up all night?

36:27.816 --> 36:29.982
Are you okay with that?

36:29.984 --> 36:34.021
Yeah, I think that's only,
like, four hours away anyway.

36:34.023 --> 36:35.022
That's fine.

36:35.024 --> 36:36.824
That's pretty great.

36:36.826 --> 36:38.726
That's pretty great.
That's pretty great.

36:48.904 --> 36:51.072
I have an idea.

36:51.074 --> 36:53.441
Let's go swimming.

36:53.443 --> 36:54.976
Why not?

36:54.978 --> 36:57.712
'Cause it's 2:00 or 3:00
in the morning.

36:57.714 --> 37:00.082
We got a great fire
and a six pack of beer.

37:00.084 --> 37:04.320
So we can go into the water
and come back and get warm.

37:04.322 --> 37:05.322
Let's go.
I'm gonna go in.

37:05.323 --> 37:06.489
Don't.

37:06.491 --> 37:07.890
I'm gonna go in.
Don't!

37:07.892 --> 37:09.625
Why not?
Kate, just don't do this.

37:09.627 --> 37:11.594
Why not?
No, don't go in the water.

37:11.596 --> 37:13.463
Why not?

37:13.465 --> 37:14.464
Last chance.

37:14.466 --> 37:15.699
Kate, stop it.

37:15.701 --> 37:17.401
Last chance.

37:17.403 --> 37:19.436
Come swimming with me.

37:19.438 --> 37:22.939
Come on! Please?

37:28.046 --> 37:30.081

38:43.027 --> 38:44.861
Yeah, I got it.

38:44.863 --> 38:47.431
Hey, listen, if you guys ever
need anything, give me a call.

38:47.433 --> 38:50.067
Really fun.
Yeah. So fun.

38:50.069 --> 38:51.168
Thank you.

38:51.170 --> 38:52.870
Thank you.
So much.

38:52.872 --> 38:53.871
So great.

38:53.873 --> 38:55.439
Sleep well, guys.

38:55.441 --> 38:56.607
See you later.

38:56.609 --> 38:57.608
You have keys?

38:57.610 --> 38:58.809
Yes.

39:01.914 --> 39:02.947
Hey.

39:02.949 --> 39:04.215
Do you want me to drive?

39:04.217 --> 39:07.852
No,
I kind of need to talk to you.

39:07.854 --> 39:09.621
Um...

39:09.623 --> 39:12.790
Do you want to go...
is there some place...

39:12.792 --> 39:14.226
Where do you want to go?

39:14.228 --> 39:16.228
Home.
Can we just go home?

39:16.230 --> 39:19.698
I'm really tired. I'm...

39:19.700 --> 39:22.167
Yeah, okay. All right.

39:22.169 --> 39:24.870
Maybe we'll just drive a bit.

40:04.113 --> 40:05.948
All right, I hope you pussies

40:05.950 --> 40:08.251
are up
for some drinking tonight!

40:08.253 --> 40:10.019
Look at this entrance.

40:10.021 --> 40:13.723
No one's going home
to their significant other,

40:13.725 --> 40:15.692
because I no longer have one.

40:15.694 --> 40:17.594
That's right!

40:17.596 --> 40:20.763
The shackles are off.

40:20.765 --> 40:21.966
I'm free.

40:21.968 --> 40:22.967
Thank you.
Thank you.

40:24.637 --> 40:26.804
Thank you.
Thank you.

40:26.806 --> 40:29.573
So anyway,
get yourselves prepared.

40:29.575 --> 40:30.574
Do what you need to do.

40:30.576 --> 40:32.610
Cancel on your wives,

40:32.612 --> 40:34.980
and, um,
I'll see you pussies tonight.

40:34.982 --> 40:36.047
Okay.

40:36.049 --> 40:37.115
All right?
Yeah.

40:37.117 --> 40:38.350
Bye.

40:42.622 --> 40:44.289
Sorry.

40:45.592 --> 40:46.591
Hey.

40:46.593 --> 40:47.726
What?

40:47.728 --> 40:48.728
For you.
Is that for me?

40:48.730 --> 40:49.729
Yes, the candle fell in.

40:49.731 --> 40:50.730
Thanks, Gene.

40:50.732 --> 40:51.931
Cheers.
Cheers.

40:51.933 --> 40:53.199
Thanks, guys.
To your new life.

40:53.201 --> 40:54.233
To your freedom.

40:54.235 --> 40:55.768
Yes.

40:55.770 --> 40:57.169
It's a personality thing.

40:57.171 --> 40:59.705
I would advise someone
in a reverse situation

40:59.707 --> 41:00.973
to give you more...

41:00.975 --> 41:02.209
Oh-oh, got 'em.
Got 'em.

41:02.211 --> 41:03.210
Two shots of Malort.

41:03.212 --> 41:04.611
Uh, no.

41:04.613 --> 41:05.846
Right from the basement.
Go on.

41:05.848 --> 41:07.648
I'm not drinking the Malort.

41:07.650 --> 41:09.182
You're gonna have to.
It's a Chicago tradition.

41:09.184 --> 41:10.884
You're single.
This'll erase all past mistakes.

41:10.886 --> 41:12.052
I'm single!

41:12.054 --> 41:13.320
It does?
Makes room for new ones.

41:13.322 --> 41:15.122
Oh, my God!
Here we go.

41:15.124 --> 41:17.792
It's like swallowing
a burnt condom full of gas.

41:17.794 --> 41:20.194
Ah!

41:20.196 --> 41:21.796
Ugh.

41:21.798 --> 41:25.233
Look at that weird form.

41:25.235 --> 41:26.901
Well, it's this damn heater,
you know?

41:26.903 --> 41:28.369
I don't know.

41:32.142 --> 41:33.375
Uh-oh.

41:33.377 --> 41:34.376
There she is.

41:34.378 --> 41:35.377
Up top.

41:35.379 --> 41:37.680
Hey!
Aw.

41:37.682 --> 41:39.948
Thanks.

41:39.950 --> 41:41.216
You okay?

41:41.218 --> 41:43.319
Yeah. Yeah.

41:43.321 --> 41:44.320
Yeah.
Crazy.

41:44.322 --> 41:45.321
No, it's good, though.

41:45.323 --> 41:46.856
You sure?

41:46.858 --> 41:48.158
Yeah. It's... I'm young,
you know?

41:48.160 --> 41:49.659
Of course you're young.

41:49.661 --> 41:51.061
Don't hold me down.
No, yeah.

41:51.063 --> 41:52.128
Can't hold me back.

41:52.130 --> 41:53.396
Hey, come outside with me.

41:53.398 --> 41:54.864
Let's have a cigarette
and talk.

41:54.866 --> 41:55.933
No.
I'm gonna see you inside.

41:55.935 --> 41:57.635
I'm gonna play games.

41:57.637 --> 41:59.036
Hey, get out here.
Let's have one cigarette.

41:59.038 --> 42:00.337
No!
I want to hear what happened.

42:00.339 --> 42:02.273
Come back soon.

42:07.345 --> 42:09.346
You're the prettiest girl
at work.

42:09.348 --> 42:11.149
I'm the only girl at work.

42:11.151 --> 42:13.685
Still.
You still are the prettiest.

42:13.687 --> 42:15.253
You could have been
the ugliest girl at work

42:15.255 --> 42:16.421
and still been the only one.

42:16.423 --> 42:18.123
You're not.
True, true.

42:18.125 --> 42:19.357
I've been ten minutes out
since I got here.

42:19.359 --> 42:20.826
I had one of these,
and then I said,

42:20.828 --> 42:21.960
"I'm gonna have one of those,"

42:21.962 --> 42:23.362
and then here I am.

42:23.364 --> 42:25.665
Yeah, it's hard
once it starts going in.

42:25.667 --> 42:26.666
I don't know what I am.

42:26.668 --> 42:28.234
Four or five in?

42:28.236 --> 42:29.702
You're five in?

42:29.704 --> 42:31.137
I might've.
Oh.

42:31.139 --> 42:33.439
But I had a turkey burger
earlier, so...

42:33.441 --> 42:35.675
You're really
keeping it together.

42:35.677 --> 42:38.412
Yeah, I'm a quiet drunk.

42:38.414 --> 42:39.913
You're right!

42:39.915 --> 42:40.914
Oh, my God!

42:40.916 --> 42:42.783
I know.
What?

42:42.785 --> 42:44.918
Let it sink in, 'cause
I've been thinking about it for,

42:44.920 --> 42:46.453
like, an hour and a half.

42:46.455 --> 42:48.188
It's really our bottom half.
That's right.

42:48.190 --> 42:49.323
Top half, I win for sure.

42:49.325 --> 42:51.860
Yeah. I'm gonna leave.

42:51.862 --> 42:54.062
I like how wear...
we are, right?

42:54.064 --> 42:55.063
The same everything.

42:55.065 --> 42:56.397
Guys? I'm gonna go.

42:56.399 --> 42:58.099
Gene, good night.
Always a pleasure.

42:58.101 --> 42:59.934
Hey, good night.
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

42:59.936 --> 43:00.935
See you tomorrow.

43:00.937 --> 43:03.071
Bye, Gene.

43:03.073 --> 43:06.475
And he wears it every time
we all get together.

43:06.477 --> 43:08.878
No, 'cause
it's a conversation starter!

43:08.880 --> 43:10.479
We wouldn't have jobs
if it wasn't for Gene.

43:10.481 --> 43:12.181
I respect Gene.

43:12.183 --> 43:14.483
I respect Gene,
and I respect your jean choice.

43:14.485 --> 43:16.118
Because they're the same
as mine.

43:16.120 --> 43:18.021
Yeah, because
they're the same as yours.

43:18.023 --> 43:19.456
Yeah. It's cool.

43:19.458 --> 43:21.091
Hey, I'm gonna take off.
Want a ride?

43:21.093 --> 43:23.160
Luke. Luke. Luke.
Luke, look at our legs.

43:23.162 --> 43:25.028
Look at all how...

43:25.030 --> 43:26.163
It looks like the same person!

43:26.165 --> 43:27.397
She's melted.

43:27.399 --> 43:28.799
She's melting in her shoes.

43:28.801 --> 43:30.267
Yeah, we wear the same clothes!

43:30.269 --> 43:31.836
Would you like a ride home?
I'm gonna go.

43:31.838 --> 43:32.937
I'm happy
to put your bike in my car.

43:32.939 --> 43:34.372
No, you can't go.

43:34.374 --> 43:35.973
I'm gonna give you a ride.
Let's go.

43:35.975 --> 43:37.308
Lock the doors.
Come on. Let's go.

43:37.310 --> 43:38.943
Why? No, come on.

43:38.945 --> 43:40.211
She's good, man.
She's good.

43:40.213 --> 43:42.246
I'm not talking to you, dude.

43:42.248 --> 43:44.349
But you know she's good.
She's fine. She'll get home.

43:44.351 --> 43:45.350
Luke...

43:45.352 --> 43:47.886
Stay.

43:47.888 --> 43:49.955
Does he say that in Star Wars?

43:50.991 --> 43:52.925
Kate, you want a ride home?

43:52.927 --> 43:53.959
Nah, I'm good.

43:53.961 --> 43:55.093
Okay.

43:56.896 --> 43:59.465
Boo.

43:59.467 --> 44:02.335
But wait,
I need to take a photo.

44:02.337 --> 44:03.937
Instagram?
You gonna Instagram it?

44:03.939 --> 44:05.138
I'm gonna mentally Instagram.

44:05.140 --> 44:06.239
Okay.

44:06.241 --> 44:08.041
In the future, you can do that.

44:08.043 --> 44:10.310
That's true.

44:10.312 --> 44:11.478
You home?

44:11.480 --> 44:12.780
Hey.

44:12.782 --> 44:13.981
Hey, where are ya?

44:13.983 --> 44:15.216
I'm in here.

44:18.420 --> 44:19.420
Hey, baby.

44:19.422 --> 44:21.188
Hey.

44:23.959 --> 44:25.894
What are you doing?

44:25.896 --> 44:27.529
Just working.

44:27.531 --> 44:30.932
Can you bring me home
a shipping crate from work?

44:30.934 --> 44:33.235
I was gonna put it on its side,

44:33.237 --> 44:35.303
then put this in,
and then, like, mount it...

44:35.305 --> 44:36.938
Sure.
On the wall.

44:36.940 --> 44:38.407
That's easy enough.
How many you want?

44:38.409 --> 44:40.543
Just one.

44:40.545 --> 44:42.078
Okay.
I'm gonna get a beer.

44:42.080 --> 44:43.412
You want anything
from the kitchen?

44:43.414 --> 44:44.413
No, thank you.

44:44.415 --> 44:45.414
Nothing?

44:45.416 --> 44:46.415
I'm okay.
Okay.

44:46.417 --> 44:47.416
Thank you, baby.

44:47.418 --> 44:49.018
Okay.

44:55.526 --> 44:57.527
Hey, you want to hear
something crazy?

44:57.529 --> 44:59.596
Yeah.

44:59.598 --> 45:04.001
Um, Kate broke up with Chris.

45:09.008 --> 45:12.410
Yeah,
broke his heart or something.

45:12.412 --> 45:14.345
What, today?

45:14.347 --> 45:15.880
All... I don't know.

45:15.882 --> 45:17.949
I think last night
or early this morning.

45:17.951 --> 45:19.985
I mean, she literally
walked in this morning...

45:19.987 --> 45:21.520
you know,
you know how much I like Kate,

45:21.522 --> 45:23.355
but it's the thing about her
that's annoying,

45:23.357 --> 45:25.124
where you're like...

45:25.126 --> 45:27.860
You know, she came in, literally
going like, "I'm free!"

45:27.862 --> 45:30.329
That's why everybody
went out drinking tonight.

45:30.331 --> 45:32.999
She had, like, a party tonight

45:33.001 --> 45:34.634
about being free from Chris.

45:34.636 --> 45:36.002
And I like Chris.

45:36.004 --> 45:38.571
Yeah.

45:38.573 --> 45:39.572
Who knows.

45:39.574 --> 45:40.974
Um...

45:40.976 --> 45:42.008
Do you mind if I go watch TV?

45:42.010 --> 45:43.410
I feel, like, emotionally...

45:43.412 --> 45:45.145
No, that's fine.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:45.147 --> 45:46.147
Do you care?

45:46.149 --> 45:47.315
No, I'm just gonna...

45:47.317 --> 45:48.916
Keep doing this?
Mm-hmm.

45:48.918 --> 45:51.619
You want to go to bed
in, like, 45 minutes?

45:51.621 --> 45:52.620
Okay.

45:52.622 --> 45:54.355
Good.

46:18.215 --> 46:19.215
Hey, babe?

46:19.217 --> 46:20.583
Did I tell you,

46:20.585 --> 46:22.652
I think I might actually go
to Costa Rica?

46:22.654 --> 46:25.154
No, you didn't.

46:25.156 --> 46:26.490
Yeah.

46:26.492 --> 46:27.925
I thought
you didn't want to go.

46:27.927 --> 46:30.160
No, I didn't.

46:30.162 --> 46:33.998
Yeah, I just thought it was
gonna be kind of like a bummer,

46:34.000 --> 46:36.133
like, trying
to re-create college,

46:36.135 --> 46:40.105
but I was, like,
texting with Kelly,

46:40.107 --> 46:42.140
and the more
I thought about it,

46:42.142 --> 46:44.642
I just, like... I think
I'll be sad if I don't go.

46:44.644 --> 46:46.611
Fun.
How long are you gonna go?

46:46.613 --> 46:47.946
Just, like, a week.

46:47.948 --> 46:50.248
Wow.
Is that okay?

46:50.250 --> 46:52.017
Yeah, I just thought
you didn't want to go.

46:52.019 --> 46:53.986
Okay.

46:53.988 --> 46:55.988
But I'm not, like,
putting you out?

46:55.990 --> 46:58.391
No.
Okay.

47:01.128 --> 47:03.229
Hey, babe, um...

47:04.564 --> 47:06.232
Can I bring something up?

47:08.002 --> 47:09.603
But you have to promise
not to get mad.

47:09.605 --> 47:12.472
Jill, are you kidding me?

47:14.108 --> 47:15.675
Uh...

47:15.677 --> 47:17.044
No, it's not... it's not bad.

47:17.046 --> 47:18.178
Okay, what?
It's not... no.

47:18.180 --> 47:19.212
I just feel like...

47:19.214 --> 47:22.150
Please.

47:22.152 --> 47:23.484
Okay.

47:25.988 --> 47:29.557
If we want to get married...

47:29.559 --> 47:31.125
Which we do.

47:31.127 --> 47:35.297
Uh, I think...

47:35.299 --> 47:36.765
it is in our best interest

47:36.767 --> 47:40.369
to reopen that...

47:40.371 --> 47:42.337
Continue having
great relationship.

47:42.339 --> 47:44.506
I just, uh...

47:44.508 --> 47:46.642
I would love to reopen the floor
for that conversation.

47:46.644 --> 47:48.178
Absolutely.

47:48.180 --> 47:49.612
I think the last time
we talked about it

47:49.614 --> 47:51.714
is where we still kind of
stand... at least for me...

47:51.716 --> 47:53.149
that we are gonna get married.

47:53.151 --> 47:54.584
We just have to find
the right time

47:54.586 --> 47:56.419
when we're not
as slammed to figure it all out.

47:56.421 --> 47:58.221
Yeah.

47:58.223 --> 48:00.223
'Cause figuring it out's
kind of the boring part.

48:00.225 --> 48:01.725
Totally. Um...

48:01.727 --> 48:04.228
Yeah, figuring it out
is the boring part.

48:04.230 --> 48:06.397
Um...

48:06.399 --> 48:10.634
No, I just don't want to, like,
be that couple that's like,

48:10.636 --> 48:14.639
"Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we're getting married."

48:14.641 --> 48:16.308
Uh, yeah.

48:16.310 --> 48:20.345
I just would like to have
a conversation about it.

48:20.347 --> 48:21.680
Okay.

48:21.682 --> 48:23.315
We don't have to do it
right now.

48:23.317 --> 48:24.316
Great. Great.

48:24.318 --> 48:25.717
All right.

48:25.719 --> 48:27.552
Can we not do... honestly,
I feel brain-dead.

48:27.554 --> 48:29.789
No, no, no, it's...
I'm tired.

48:29.791 --> 48:32.158
But I do feel the same way
that I feel.

48:32.160 --> 48:35.194
Like, you know where I'm at.

48:35.196 --> 48:36.796
Okay.
Do you know where I'm at?

48:36.798 --> 48:39.132
Yeah, but I feel...
but what I'm saying is,

48:39.134 --> 48:40.366
that I think that...

48:42.837 --> 48:44.571
If it just feels like
it's gonna happen...

48:44.573 --> 48:45.839
Right.

48:45.841 --> 48:47.341
We're never gonna
actually do it.

48:47.343 --> 48:48.342
Right.

48:48.344 --> 48:50.110
Um, look at that.

48:50.112 --> 48:51.512
That was...
Look at that.

48:51.514 --> 48:52.746
That's it.
That's everything.

48:52.748 --> 48:53.847
That's the whole convo.

48:53.849 --> 48:55.150
Are you upset with me at all?

48:55.152 --> 48:56.384
Be honest.

48:56.386 --> 48:57.552
No.
Okay.

48:57.554 --> 48:58.820
Are you upset with me?
Like, I...

48:58.822 --> 49:00.522
No.
I don't want to be the...

49:00.524 --> 49:03.191
And I do want to get married,
and I do want to do it.

49:03.193 --> 49:05.293
It's just... I feel like
there's gonna be the right time

49:05.295 --> 49:07.095
to get into it,

49:07.097 --> 49:08.597
'cause it's gonna be
so much planning and work.

49:08.599 --> 49:10.332
It is.
You're right.

49:10.334 --> 49:14.603
And I think the right moment
will present itself...

49:14.605 --> 49:16.672
if we continue to have these
talks to get us there.

49:16.674 --> 49:18.841
Awesome. Awesome.

49:18.843 --> 49:20.109
Good?

49:20.111 --> 49:21.710
We're so connected.

49:21.712 --> 49:23.747
I feel like
you're reading my mind.

49:23.749 --> 49:25.248
Really?
How connected are we?

49:27.252 --> 49:29.119
She's not wasting any time.

49:29.121 --> 49:30.654
Yeah, well...

49:30.656 --> 49:32.756
I'm kind of... I feel bad
that I know, to be honest.

49:32.758 --> 49:34.224
Really?

49:34.226 --> 49:35.459
What's up, boys?
A little bit.

49:35.461 --> 49:36.460
Morning.

49:36.462 --> 49:37.461
You guys get after it?

49:37.463 --> 49:38.629
How you doing?

49:38.631 --> 49:39.864
Good.
How late did you guys get?

49:39.866 --> 49:41.365
Not late enough, apparently.

49:41.367 --> 49:42.633
Yeah, yeah, right.

49:42.635 --> 49:44.302
You want to go in on a plaque?

49:44.304 --> 49:46.170
Not particularly.
Do I have to?

49:46.172 --> 49:47.505
Yeah,
we're getting Dave a plaque.

49:47.507 --> 49:48.739
Yeah.

49:48.741 --> 49:50.842
You know Ryan at the bar?
Yeah.

49:50.844 --> 49:52.411
Dave went home with Kate
last night.

49:52.413 --> 49:53.745
They were making out
on the street.

49:53.747 --> 49:55.581
That's bullshit.

49:55.583 --> 49:57.683
Making out in the street.
Before they got in the cab.

49:57.685 --> 49:59.451
You guys saw it?
Not just splitting a cab.

49:59.453 --> 50:00.452
Ryan saw it.
Ryan.

50:00.454 --> 50:02.154
Ryan saw it.

50:02.156 --> 50:04.224
If you can't trust him,
who can you trust, right?

50:04.226 --> 50:05.291
Kind of sucks.

50:05.293 --> 50:06.292
Yeah.
Here's Dave.

50:06.294 --> 50:07.627
We can find out from the source.

50:07.629 --> 50:09.195
I kind of feel,
like, bad that I know,

50:09.197 --> 50:10.563
because
how's she gonna walk in here?

50:10.565 --> 50:11.898
Yeah, totally.
That's crazy, man.

50:11.900 --> 50:13.399
I wouldn't put
those two together.

50:13.401 --> 50:14.400
No, me neither.

50:14.402 --> 50:15.501
If I had to draw lines...

50:15.503 --> 50:16.870
No, never.
Yeah, man.

50:16.872 --> 50:19.707
Everybody knows.
The whole brewery knows.

50:19.709 --> 50:21.408
I'm not getting into this
with you guys.

50:21.410 --> 50:22.743
Hey, come on, man.

50:22.745 --> 50:24.778
Everybody...
Ryan told everybody.

50:24.780 --> 50:27.248
Ryan saw you.

50:27.250 --> 50:28.449
So what?

50:28.451 --> 50:30.218
Yeah, I'm not getting into it.

50:30.220 --> 50:31.886
Come on.

50:38.628 --> 50:40.262
Hi.

50:40.264 --> 50:42.530
I can't do
any more phone calls.

50:42.532 --> 50:45.268
Oh, yeah?
They see through me.

50:45.270 --> 50:46.269
They see through this.

50:46.271 --> 50:47.670
You should drink some coffee.

50:47.672 --> 50:49.372
I had so much coffee,
but let's get food.

50:49.374 --> 50:50.706
I need some...
do you want to get some?

50:50.708 --> 50:52.275
Can't.
I'm slammed actually, Kate.

50:52.277 --> 50:53.442
You're not having lunch?

51:02.854 --> 51:04.721
Yo!

51:04.723 --> 51:07.658
We have enough clean kegs for
the stuff in the bright tank?

51:10.396 --> 51:11.496
Luke.

51:11.498 --> 51:12.897
What's up?

51:12.899 --> 51:14.666
What's up with the bright tank?
Are we good?

51:14.668 --> 51:16.301
I'm working, Dave.

51:16.303 --> 51:17.735
I'm asking you a work question.

51:17.737 --> 51:19.537
What did you ask me, man?

51:19.539 --> 51:21.806
I asked you if we have enough
clean kegs for the bright tank.

51:21.808 --> 51:23.274
I'm not in the fucking mood,
man.

51:23.276 --> 51:25.377
Everything's off.

51:37.725 --> 51:39.392
Yeah.

51:39.394 --> 51:40.660
You got to...
you got to revisit it.

51:40.662 --> 51:43.496
It's amazing.

51:43.498 --> 51:46.599
And the next development
is a canning line,

51:46.601 --> 51:48.368
which is great,

51:48.370 --> 51:50.270
'cause as of now,
we can't sell the beer in cans.

51:50.272 --> 51:51.572
Will you excuse me one second,
Eli?

51:51.574 --> 51:52.873
Absolutely.

51:52.875 --> 51:55.643
I'm gonna be right...
right back.

51:55.645 --> 51:58.379
Yo.
Yo.

51:58.381 --> 51:59.380
Where you going?

51:59.382 --> 52:00.881
Going home, man.

52:00.883 --> 52:02.683
Why don't you stay
and have one beer with me?

52:02.685 --> 52:04.519
'Cause I'm having a shit day,
and I'm ready...

52:04.521 --> 52:05.787
What are you doing?
Going home.

52:05.789 --> 52:06.788
You owe me a beer.

52:06.790 --> 52:08.023
I owe you a beer?

52:08.025 --> 52:10.058
Yeah, we have to sit
and have a beer.

52:10.060 --> 52:12.627
Hey, guys. Drinks?

52:12.629 --> 52:13.628
Oh, we have plans.

52:13.630 --> 52:14.796
Oh, we do?

52:14.798 --> 52:15.931
All right.
Have fun, guys.

52:15.933 --> 52:17.399
You want to all get together,

52:17.401 --> 52:18.701
tip a few back
and see what happens?

52:18.703 --> 52:20.470
Shut up. Dave.

52:20.472 --> 52:22.739
Please?

52:22.741 --> 52:24.340
One fucking beer.

52:24.342 --> 52:25.541
All right.

52:25.543 --> 52:26.642
Thank you.

52:26.644 --> 52:28.611
I'm gonna go finish up with Eli.

52:28.613 --> 52:29.612
I'll be right back.

52:29.614 --> 52:30.713
Great. Close the deal.

52:30.715 --> 52:31.882
I'll meet you over there.

52:31.884 --> 52:33.450
Yeah, of course.
Thank you.

52:33.452 --> 52:35.686
You're welcome.

52:39.991 --> 52:41.658
I was full of shit yesterday.

52:41.660 --> 52:43.794
I don't know.

52:43.796 --> 52:45.096
Ugh, whatever.

52:45.098 --> 52:47.098
Hey, here's the truth:

52:47.100 --> 52:49.334
I'm done giving you shit,
and I'm sorry.

52:49.336 --> 52:50.335
I have no place.

52:50.337 --> 52:52.070
You are a grown woman,

52:52.072 --> 52:55.673
and if you want to have sex
with a disgusting, bad brewer

52:55.675 --> 52:59.078
with a terrible attitude...

53:00.680 --> 53:03.949
I don't love Dave.

53:03.951 --> 53:05.484
You smell good.

53:05.486 --> 53:06.485
Really?

53:06.487 --> 53:07.820
Yeah.

53:07.822 --> 53:10.923
Surprised you got all of Dave
off of ya.

53:10.925 --> 53:13.760
Maybe you're smelling Dave.

53:28.544 --> 53:31.779
Mine would be a futon,
and then all... you know...

53:31.781 --> 53:33.648
It's just very... it's cool.

53:33.650 --> 53:35.683
It's, like, cozy,
but it's still all put together.

53:35.685 --> 53:36.851
Jill, this place is so great.

53:36.853 --> 53:38.754
Oh, thank you so much.

53:38.756 --> 53:40.122
Yeah, she was
just complimenting it

53:40.124 --> 53:41.990
and how great your style is
and all of that.

53:41.992 --> 53:42.991
Oh, my style?

53:42.993 --> 53:43.992
Yeah, you got style.

53:43.994 --> 53:45.861
You got style, woman.

53:45.863 --> 53:48.464
I've got a veggie lasagna,
but it's not done yet,

53:48.466 --> 53:51.667
so I thought I would feed us
something for now.

53:51.669 --> 53:52.735
Thank you. Wow.

53:52.737 --> 53:53.736
You are the best.

53:53.738 --> 53:54.938
This is great.

53:54.940 --> 53:56.573
Hey, cheers, everybody.
Yes.

53:56.575 --> 53:58.942
To being in our house
and hanging out with us

53:58.944 --> 53:59.976
and for making a great meal.

53:59.978 --> 54:01.411
To our new kid.

54:01.413 --> 54:04.180
Aw.
Thanks, Mom. Thanks, Dad.

54:04.182 --> 54:05.482
Aw.
Couldn't resist.

54:05.484 --> 54:06.917
I got her when she young.

54:06.919 --> 54:08.919
She was 21.
She didn't know any better.

54:08.921 --> 54:10.788
She hadn't seen the world yet.
I could really...

54:10.790 --> 54:12.590
I have a feeling she knew
what she was doing.

54:12.592 --> 54:13.858
I could really do
my C-plus material,

54:13.860 --> 54:15.059
and she was like, "Wow."

54:16.863 --> 54:19.096
I could be half drunk
and still make it work.

54:19.098 --> 54:21.099
And then to evolve.
I mean, 21's so young.

54:21.101 --> 54:22.934
And then you get older,
and so much happens.

54:22.936 --> 54:25.003
You change in those years
drastically.

54:25.005 --> 54:26.872
Oh, yeah.

54:26.874 --> 54:29.541
No, I for sure thought that I
was gonna fuck a lot more dudes.

54:30.544 --> 54:32.043
All right, Jill.

54:32.045 --> 54:33.913
I'm right here.

54:33.915 --> 54:35.481
I mean, that's the thing.

54:35.483 --> 54:36.949
Yeah, maybe, like,
almost fuck a chick

54:36.951 --> 54:38.718
and then chicken out.

54:38.720 --> 54:40.686
Right, just dabble.
That's what college is for.

54:40.688 --> 54:41.921
But at least
I could have tried!

54:41.923 --> 54:43.055
Right.

54:43.057 --> 54:46.627
You still can, the last one.

54:46.629 --> 54:48.128
I think that's great.

54:49.498 --> 54:50.697
I mean, it's overrated.

54:50.699 --> 54:52.099
That whole thing is overrated.

54:52.101 --> 54:56.970
It ends in pain
and lots of walking in shame.

54:56.972 --> 54:59.206
No, I feel lucky
I got a good one.

54:59.208 --> 55:02.043
I didn't have to wade through
too many...

55:02.045 --> 55:03.077
Yeah.

55:03.079 --> 55:04.612
Bad ones.

55:04.614 --> 55:07.148
Yeah.

55:07.150 --> 55:09.617
Good thing.

55:33.844 --> 55:34.844
Hey, baby.

55:34.846 --> 55:35.912
Hey.

55:38.649 --> 55:40.985
Frank's an idiot.

55:40.987 --> 55:42.086
What?

55:42.088 --> 55:43.888
Nothing.

55:47.659 --> 55:49.627
You doing some packing?

55:49.629 --> 55:51.228
Indeed.

55:55.702 --> 55:57.803
What Narcissism Means to Me?

56:00.306 --> 56:02.808
When did you start reading
a book of poetry?

56:02.810 --> 56:03.942
Do you know who gave me that?

56:03.944 --> 56:05.777
No.

56:05.779 --> 56:08.581
Uh, Chris.

56:08.583 --> 56:10.149
Chris of Kate and Chris.

56:10.151 --> 56:11.851
Why did Chris
give you a book called

56:11.853 --> 56:14.187
What Narcissism Means to Me?

56:14.189 --> 56:15.622
Uh, I don't know.

56:15.624 --> 56:18.224
The title,
I can't actually say...

56:18.226 --> 56:21.662
Um, I don't want this.

56:21.664 --> 56:25.599
But he just came by
the farmer's market,

56:25.601 --> 56:29.203
and, like, gave me a...

56:30.705 --> 56:32.606
He went to the farmer's market?

56:32.608 --> 56:34.643
Yeah, he came by
the farmer's market.

56:34.645 --> 56:38.246
He gave me, like, a...

56:38.248 --> 56:39.581
What a sweet guy.

56:39.583 --> 56:40.782
Yeah. Yeah.

56:40.784 --> 56:42.684
He seemed, like...
he seemed okay.

56:42.686 --> 56:45.186
He seemed, like...

56:45.188 --> 56:48.024
happy and healthy
and fine and...

57:02.607 --> 57:04.241
Just, uh...

57:07.078 --> 57:11.048
A reminder or a-a query.

57:11.050 --> 57:12.049
Um...

57:12.051 --> 57:13.283
A query?

57:13.285 --> 57:16.921
Have you been thinking
at all about

57:16.923 --> 57:19.323
the old marriage convo,

57:19.325 --> 57:20.324
the worst convo...

57:20.326 --> 57:21.359
Yeah.

57:21.361 --> 57:24.395
In the history of the world?

57:24.397 --> 57:25.396
Absolutely.

57:25.398 --> 57:26.397
Yeah?

57:26.399 --> 57:27.932
Yes. I have.

57:27.934 --> 57:29.835
What have... what have you been
thinking about?

57:29.837 --> 57:31.003
All good stuff.

57:31.005 --> 57:32.838
Yeah?

57:32.840 --> 57:34.773
Um...

57:37.143 --> 57:38.410
Yeah,
just maybe while I'm gone,

57:38.412 --> 57:41.814
like, if you have thoughts on

57:41.816 --> 57:43.683
just general timing and...

57:43.685 --> 57:46.086
Okay.

57:46.088 --> 57:47.654
You got it.

57:47.656 --> 57:48.722
That would be great.

57:48.724 --> 57:50.023
I'll give it a lot of thought.

57:50.025 --> 57:51.758
That would make me feel
really good.

57:51.760 --> 57:52.992
Oh, good.
Okay.

57:52.994 --> 57:54.060
You think about it too.

57:54.062 --> 57:56.430
I'm gonna.

57:56.432 --> 57:57.998
Good.

57:58.000 --> 57:59.867
Don't try to turn it around
on me.

57:59.869 --> 58:01.068
You know I'm gonna.

58:01.070 --> 58:02.770
Okay.

58:26.096 --> 58:27.830
Mm.

58:34.171 --> 58:37.174
What'd you do tonight?

58:37.176 --> 58:40.310
Um, I had some work to do,

58:40.312 --> 58:42.012
and I did some reading.

58:44.048 --> 58:45.415
Here you go.

58:47.919 --> 58:49.888
Thank you.

58:49.890 --> 58:52.090
So what's up?

58:52.092 --> 58:54.025
I don't know.
I was just out.

58:54.027 --> 58:55.393
Uh-huh.

58:55.395 --> 58:57.495
It's so hot out.

58:57.497 --> 58:59.497
Just, like, sweating my...

58:59.499 --> 59:00.498
Yeah.

59:00.500 --> 59:03.101
Sweating my balls off.

59:03.103 --> 59:04.970
Yeah. What's up?

59:04.972 --> 59:06.038
Sit down.

59:06.040 --> 59:07.173
No, I'm gonna stand.

59:07.175 --> 59:09.074
Ugh, sit down.

59:09.076 --> 59:10.142
I'm gonna stand here.

59:10.144 --> 59:11.143
Tell me what's up.

59:11.145 --> 59:12.278
Why'd you come over?

59:12.280 --> 59:13.979
'Cause I miss you.

59:13.981 --> 59:15.314
Okay.

59:15.316 --> 59:18.919
Um, here's the thing.

59:18.921 --> 59:20.053
Yes?

59:20.055 --> 59:21.922
All right?

59:21.924 --> 59:23.223
Can you please...
it's hard...

59:23.225 --> 59:25.091
it's not nice
to be on another level.

59:25.093 --> 59:27.227
You have to sit, because I can't
hear you all the way up...

59:27.229 --> 59:28.228
hello?

59:28.230 --> 59:29.796
Here's the thing.

59:29.798 --> 59:31.232
I can't hear you up there.

59:31.234 --> 59:32.233
Okay. Kate?

59:32.235 --> 59:34.001
Yes.

59:34.003 --> 59:36.871
I was serious about
what I said the other day.

59:36.873 --> 59:39.307
I know, and I heard you.

59:39.309 --> 59:42.343
Yeah, well, what I said was,

59:42.345 --> 59:45.314
I don't think
that this is working.

59:45.316 --> 59:46.315
I think...

59:46.317 --> 59:47.883
Okay?

59:47.885 --> 59:49.218
And I don't think
this is gonna work.

59:49.220 --> 59:50.552
I think you're wrong.

59:50.554 --> 59:52.221
And I think eight months
is enough time

59:52.223 --> 59:54.489
to know
whether something's gonna work.

59:54.491 --> 59:56.992
You know...

59:56.994 --> 59:58.228
All right?

01:00:07.438 --> 01:00:09.839
What the fuck?

01:00:09.841 --> 01:00:12.243
God damn it!

01:00:12.245 --> 01:00:15.179
You stupid fucker!

01:00:15.181 --> 01:00:18.015
Why didn't you take that one?

01:00:18.017 --> 01:00:19.884
Oh, my God!

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.628
Fucking...

01:00:35.601 --> 01:00:38.304
No, I'm... I'm really excited
to see the space,

01:00:38.306 --> 01:00:41.440
and I've heard your food
is awesome.

01:00:41.442 --> 01:00:42.508
Okay, great.

01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:43.609
I'll see you guys Wednesday.

01:00:43.611 --> 01:00:45.177
Thank you.

01:00:50.484 --> 01:00:52.052
That's what I do.

01:00:52.054 --> 01:00:53.220
Impressive.

01:00:53.222 --> 01:00:55.889
Hey, is your lady in Mexico?

01:00:55.891 --> 01:00:56.924
Costa Rica.
Costa Rica?

01:00:56.926 --> 01:00:58.292
Different.

01:00:58.294 --> 01:01:00.394
Is she... uh, same-same,
sort of interchangeable.

01:01:00.396 --> 01:01:01.895
You want to get dinner with me?

01:01:01.897 --> 01:01:03.497
Dinner? Tonight?

01:01:03.499 --> 01:01:05.366
Yes.
No, in a week and a half.

01:01:05.368 --> 01:01:07.035
Tonight, yes.
You do?

01:01:07.037 --> 01:01:08.036
Yeah.
Definitely.

01:01:08.038 --> 01:01:09.404
I'm starving.

01:01:09.406 --> 01:01:11.139
I just have to make
one more phone call.

01:01:11.141 --> 01:01:12.440
Do you...
do you want to watch?

01:01:12.442 --> 01:01:13.508
Yes.

01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:14.609
All right.

01:01:14.611 --> 01:01:15.977
Weirdo.

01:01:23.019 --> 01:01:24.019
Sorry.

01:01:24.021 --> 01:01:25.120
Did you already pay?

01:01:25.122 --> 01:01:26.121
I did.
Yeah, we're good.

01:01:26.123 --> 01:01:27.122
How much do I owe you?

01:01:27.124 --> 01:01:28.357
You owe me nothing, Kate.

01:01:28.359 --> 01:01:29.358
Oh, come on.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:30.359
You owe me nothing.

01:01:30.361 --> 01:01:31.593
What a gentleman.

01:01:31.595 --> 01:01:33.129
Thanks, hubby.
Oh, I like you a lot.

01:01:33.131 --> 01:01:35.398
So sweet. So nice.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:37.200
Are you ready?

01:01:37.202 --> 01:01:39.436
Mm-hmm.

01:01:39.438 --> 01:01:40.603
Here you go, my friend.

01:01:40.605 --> 01:01:41.604
Mm.

01:01:41.606 --> 01:01:42.672
Let me give you that.

01:01:42.674 --> 01:01:44.040
Thank you.
Give me this.

01:01:44.042 --> 01:01:45.376
Thanks.

01:01:45.378 --> 01:01:47.244
Give me the pretzels.

01:01:47.246 --> 01:01:48.346
You got a hold of 'em?

01:01:48.348 --> 01:01:49.947
Okay.

01:01:49.949 --> 01:01:51.315
Okay.

01:01:51.317 --> 01:01:53.284
This is you.

01:01:53.286 --> 01:01:54.318
Oh, thanks.

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.353
Here you go, ma'am.

01:01:55.355 --> 01:01:57.054
Hey.

01:01:57.056 --> 01:01:58.089
Cheers to ya.

01:01:58.091 --> 01:01:59.191
Cheers. Thanks for dinner.

01:01:59.193 --> 01:02:01.193
Yeah.
Thanks for coming over.

01:02:03.329 --> 01:02:05.364
Yum, yum, yum.

01:02:06.566 --> 01:02:08.433
Mm.
You want 'em?

01:02:08.435 --> 01:02:09.668
Mm-hmm.

01:02:11.704 --> 01:02:13.639
It's so nice here.

01:02:13.641 --> 01:02:15.341
So when we open up our bar...

01:02:15.343 --> 01:02:18.177
Yeah.

01:02:18.179 --> 01:02:19.379
Brewing in the back.

01:02:19.381 --> 01:02:20.546
Oh, yeah.

01:02:20.548 --> 01:02:24.183
Cuba, Miami...

01:02:24.185 --> 01:02:25.651
New Orleans.

01:02:25.653 --> 01:02:28.956
I still vote Cuba.
I think we could do it.

01:02:28.958 --> 01:02:30.290
You do?

01:02:30.292 --> 01:02:31.992
We just have to sneak in
through Mexico.

01:02:31.994 --> 01:02:33.527
What do you think
the aesthetic is again?

01:02:33.529 --> 01:02:35.262
The aesthetic is...

01:02:35.264 --> 01:02:37.331
Walk me through it. You walk
in 'cause I like...

01:02:37.333 --> 01:02:39.066
Reservoir Dogs
meets Casablanca.

01:02:39.068 --> 01:02:41.002
How many times
do I have to tell you that?

01:02:41.004 --> 01:02:42.971
'Cause all I think about

01:02:42.973 --> 01:02:45.540
is fuckin' guys getting their
ears cut off in the back...

01:02:45.542 --> 01:02:47.208
Word.
And dudes... no.

01:02:47.210 --> 01:02:48.209
What a nice apartment.

01:02:48.211 --> 01:02:49.611
I want a Jill.

01:02:49.613 --> 01:02:51.112
Yeah, I'm glad I got her.

01:02:51.114 --> 01:02:52.714
Can you find me one, please?

01:02:52.716 --> 01:02:56.585
Does she have a male clone?

01:02:56.587 --> 01:02:58.487
She's got a brother,
but he's weird as fuck.

01:02:58.489 --> 01:02:59.588
I'll take it.

01:05:03.489 --> 01:05:05.523
Do you have food here?

01:05:05.525 --> 01:05:07.292
No.

01:05:16.836 --> 01:05:17.836
I'm not going far.

01:05:17.838 --> 01:05:19.605
I just need a smaller place,

01:05:19.607 --> 01:05:21.875
'cause my place
is meant for two,

01:05:21.877 --> 01:05:24.811
and I am meant for one.

01:05:24.813 --> 01:05:28.248
So I am moving
to a little place.

01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:29.316
It's good.

01:05:29.318 --> 01:05:30.318
It's got just enough room

01:05:30.319 --> 01:05:33.486
for me and my imaginary cat.

01:05:36.592 --> 01:05:37.925
Yeah, if you want help moving,

01:05:37.927 --> 01:05:39.460
I'd be happy to do it.

01:05:39.462 --> 01:05:41.229
Especially if you got to be out
by tomorrow.

01:05:41.231 --> 01:05:42.431
You don't want to help me move.

01:05:42.432 --> 01:05:43.531
No, I'm willing to help you.

01:05:43.533 --> 01:05:44.565
You're you. I'll do it.

01:05:44.567 --> 01:05:45.600
It's an awful job.

01:05:45.602 --> 01:05:47.301
Moving is what happens in hell.

01:05:50.873 --> 01:05:52.174
Um...

01:05:52.176 --> 01:05:53.842
When was the party?

01:05:53.844 --> 01:05:54.843
You were there.

01:05:54.845 --> 01:05:56.545
It was for my birthday.

01:05:56.547 --> 01:05:58.847
This is from
your birthday party, Kate?

01:05:58.849 --> 01:05:59.948
Yeah.

01:05:59.950 --> 01:06:01.783
Are you kidding me, man?

01:06:01.785 --> 01:06:03.319
Well, I knew I was moving,

01:06:03.321 --> 01:06:06.756
so I didn't bother, you know...

01:06:06.758 --> 01:06:09.292
Anyway,
I feel like we should start...

01:06:09.294 --> 01:06:11.594
First of all, I think
we should clean everything.

01:06:11.596 --> 01:06:12.762
Oh, I don't know if there's...

01:06:12.764 --> 01:06:13.896
it's gonna get dirty anyway.

01:06:13.898 --> 01:06:15.498
The cake is still here!

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:16.834
I know. I ate it all.

01:06:16.836 --> 01:06:21.372
It was, like,
the best breakfast food.

01:06:21.374 --> 01:06:22.973
Here, I got bags.

01:06:22.975 --> 01:06:25.843
All right, great.

01:06:38.257 --> 01:06:39.791
Kitchen's done.
Oh, my God.

01:06:39.793 --> 01:06:41.459
Living room's done.
What?

01:06:41.461 --> 01:06:42.560
Dining room's done.

01:06:42.562 --> 01:06:43.796
Oh, my God!

01:06:43.798 --> 01:06:45.264
Yeah, we are groovin'.

01:06:45.266 --> 01:06:46.832
That's such good news.

01:06:46.834 --> 01:06:48.601
This is a little chaotic.
Ooh, I'm so hot.

01:06:48.603 --> 01:06:49.803
Just throwing it in like that?

01:06:49.804 --> 01:06:51.570
Yeah.

01:06:51.572 --> 01:06:53.406
Yeah, 'cause I'm just gonna
take it right out.

01:06:53.408 --> 01:06:54.607
Smart.
How about the towels?

01:06:54.609 --> 01:06:55.941
You want to just throw those
on top?

01:06:55.943 --> 01:06:56.943
Oh, yeah.

01:06:56.945 --> 01:06:58.011
For protection.

01:07:00.281 --> 01:07:02.416
I like your style, friend.

01:07:04.652 --> 01:07:05.786
Thanks.

01:07:05.788 --> 01:07:06.987
Can I have a sip?

01:07:06.989 --> 01:07:08.889
Yes, ma'am.

Good morning.

01:10:09.652 --> 01:10:10.718
Really?

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.052
Yes, really.

01:10:12.054 --> 01:10:13.621
Wow.

01:10:13.623 --> 01:10:15.956
How'd you sleep?

01:10:15.958 --> 01:10:18.192
Good.

01:10:18.194 --> 01:10:19.828
So here's what I think
for today.

01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:21.596
Tell me what you think.

01:10:21.598 --> 01:10:23.198
I'm gonna take off.
I'm gonna get the U-Haul.

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.766
I already called it in.

01:10:24.768 --> 01:10:26.501
If you want to finish
doing this kitchen,

01:10:26.503 --> 01:10:27.502
I'll get the U-haul.

01:10:27.504 --> 01:10:28.503
We'll get everything.

01:10:28.505 --> 01:10:29.804
When we're done...

01:10:29.806 --> 01:10:31.773
which I think we can be done

01:10:31.775 --> 01:10:33.876
we shower, we dress up,

01:10:33.878 --> 01:10:35.678
and we go
to a nice dinner on me.

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:37.079
Really?

01:10:37.081 --> 01:10:38.748
Do the whole thing.
Feel good about it.

01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:40.550
Celebrate these couple of days.

01:10:40.552 --> 01:10:42.985
Celebrate the move.
Get a nice bite to eat.

01:10:42.987 --> 01:10:43.986
Okay.

01:10:43.988 --> 01:10:44.987
Deal?
Deal.

01:10:44.989 --> 01:10:46.857
Sealed.

01:10:46.859 --> 01:10:48.759
Okay.

01:11:15.956 --> 01:11:17.289
You good?
Yep.

01:11:17.291 --> 01:11:18.791
All right, let's do it.

01:11:18.793 --> 01:11:20.793
You got it?
Yeah.

01:11:20.795 --> 01:11:22.294
Ah, fucking Christ!

01:11:22.296 --> 01:11:23.996
Fuck!

01:11:23.998 --> 01:11:26.165
What happened?

01:11:26.167 --> 01:11:28.068
Did you drop it?

01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:30.570
There's a nail
in the fucking couch.

01:11:30.572 --> 01:11:31.571
Oh.

01:11:31.573 --> 01:11:32.839
Ah, f...

01:11:32.841 --> 01:11:34.541
Are you bleeding?

01:11:34.543 --> 01:11:36.977
Did it get on the upholstery?

01:11:36.979 --> 01:11:38.278
I don't even know
how to clean this.

01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:40.982
Ah, fucking A.

01:11:40.984 --> 01:11:42.650
Let's... let's just get it out
the door.

01:11:42.652 --> 01:11:43.918
All right, just stop, Kate.

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.753
Wait.
Give me one fucking second.

01:11:47.556 --> 01:11:49.624
Ahh...

01:11:49.626 --> 01:11:50.858
Ah.

01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:52.126
Fucking cr...

01:11:52.128 --> 01:11:53.594
Ah-ha-ha.

01:11:53.596 --> 01:11:55.163
I just left the couch
sitting on the...

01:11:55.165 --> 01:11:57.065
ah, fuck!

01:11:57.067 --> 01:11:59.134
Yeah, I think
I'm gonna need stitches.

01:11:59.136 --> 01:12:00.902
Oh, God, I'm gonna be sick.

01:12:00.904 --> 01:12:02.604
Yeah, you got any peroxide
or anything?

01:12:02.606 --> 01:12:04.306
Oh, my God,
I'm not good with...

01:12:04.308 --> 01:12:06.208
Kate, get me some peroxide,
please.

01:12:06.210 --> 01:12:07.710
I'm sorry
you're not good with it.

01:12:07.712 --> 01:12:09.178
I'm fucking bleeding.

01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:11.347
Just get me a fucking
paper towel, please, then.

01:12:11.349 --> 01:12:12.682
I have... I don't know...

01:12:12.684 --> 01:12:13.750
Just do something!

01:12:13.752 --> 01:12:14.984
Fuck!

01:12:14.986 --> 01:12:16.853
Okay, I found them.

01:12:16.855 --> 01:12:17.854
Okay, great.

01:12:17.856 --> 01:12:18.855
Oh, my God.

01:12:18.857 --> 01:12:19.856
Okay, here.

01:12:19.858 --> 01:12:21.725
Oh, my God.

01:12:21.727 --> 01:12:22.760
That's...

01:12:22.762 --> 01:12:23.761
Ahh.

01:12:23.763 --> 01:12:24.862
That's really bad.

01:12:24.864 --> 01:12:26.196
It's really, really, really bad.

01:12:26.198 --> 01:12:28.065
Yeah, it's okay.
It's okay.

01:12:28.067 --> 01:12:31.068
Should I call... you know,
should I call an ambulance?

01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:32.236
Ahh.

01:12:34.105 --> 01:12:35.807
Ah.

01:12:35.809 --> 01:12:37.075
Ah, ha-ha.

01:12:37.077 --> 01:12:38.076
Ha-ha-ha.

01:12:38.078 --> 01:12:40.645
Ah, f...

01:12:40.647 --> 01:12:43.882
Ah, fucking piece of shit.

01:12:48.789 --> 01:12:49.955
Hey, is this you?

01:12:49.957 --> 01:12:51.057
Yeah, that's me.

01:12:51.059 --> 01:12:52.825
Move your fucking van, buddy!

01:12:52.827 --> 01:12:54.260
Wait, we just have to get
the couch in.

01:12:54.262 --> 01:12:56.028
Hey, pal.

01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:58.097
I don't care what
your fucking girlfriend says!

01:12:58.099 --> 01:12:59.732
Move the van, pal!
Are you kidding?

01:12:59.734 --> 01:13:00.866
Hang on one second.

01:13:00.868 --> 01:13:02.202
Shut up, lady!

01:13:02.204 --> 01:13:03.870
It's fucking hot out here.

01:13:03.872 --> 01:13:05.672
I've been out here
for five fucking minutes!

01:13:05.674 --> 01:13:07.207
Fuck you.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:13:07.209 --> 01:13:08.709
I've tried being fucking cool!

01:13:08.711 --> 01:13:10.243
Give me the fucking keys then,
shithead!

01:13:10.245 --> 01:13:11.244
Luke! Luke! Luke!

01:13:11.246 --> 01:13:12.679
Move the fucking van, asshole!

01:13:12.681 --> 01:13:13.947
Jesus Christ!
I'll move the van.

01:13:13.949 --> 01:13:16.217
I will move it.

01:13:16.219 --> 01:13:17.819
He's really... he's lucky.

01:13:17.821 --> 01:13:19.220
You're lucky.

01:13:19.222 --> 01:13:20.922
You're lucky
that no one called the cops.

01:13:20.924 --> 01:13:22.790
You're lucky
he didn't press charges.

01:13:22.792 --> 01:13:24.892
He's lucky I didn't continue
to kick his fucking ass.

01:13:24.894 --> 01:13:25.893
Oh, my God.

01:13:25.895 --> 01:13:27.228
What is the point of that?

01:13:27.230 --> 01:13:28.964
That's so stupid.
This is so stupid.

01:13:28.966 --> 01:13:30.933
Can I just call...
I'm just gonna call some people,

01:13:30.935 --> 01:13:33.135
and have them come and help me
move out of my fucking place.

01:13:33.137 --> 01:13:35.304
Kate, give me one... give me one
fucking second, please.

01:13:35.306 --> 01:13:37.005
I made room!

01:13:37.007 --> 01:13:39.007
This futuristic device,
I wasn't familiar with.

01:13:39.009 --> 01:13:40.876
Please be careful with it.
It's my love life.

01:13:40.878 --> 01:13:43.079
Is it? It's all you got?
Do you think it needs a box?

01:13:43.081 --> 01:13:44.781
No, I think...
I think it's fine.

01:13:44.783 --> 01:13:46.316
I think if you have any luck,
it'll break.

01:13:46.318 --> 01:13:48.885
Oh.

01:13:48.887 --> 01:13:50.854
Oh, wow.

01:13:50.856 --> 01:13:52.455
So manly. So strapping.

01:13:52.457 --> 01:13:54.290
Yeah, I got everything.

01:13:59.765 --> 01:14:01.465
Tell me more
about this beer you have.

01:14:01.467 --> 01:14:05.436
Oh, ow, ow, ow.

01:14:05.438 --> 01:14:08.773
Ow, ow.

01:14:08.775 --> 01:14:12.778
Ow, ow, ow.

01:14:25.159 --> 01:14:27.393
Oh, fucking Christ.

01:14:38.973 --> 01:14:41.575
How's your hand?

01:14:46.414 --> 01:14:49.016
There used to be a cool
magic store around here.

01:14:52.354 --> 01:14:54.155
Careful with my pussy.

01:14:55.524 --> 01:14:57.292
How long have you been waiting
to say that?

01:14:57.294 --> 01:14:59.194
The whole U-haul ride,
you've been thinking...

01:14:59.196 --> 01:15:00.528
All day.

01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:02.163
"Oh, when he gets
to take that out"...

01:15:02.165 --> 01:15:03.532
Dude.

01:15:16.547 --> 01:15:18.548
Okay.

01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:20.317
I know I sound
like a broken record,

01:15:20.319 --> 01:15:22.352
but just to be honest,

01:15:22.354 --> 01:15:24.955
this place... it rules.

01:15:24.957 --> 01:15:26.022
Right?
It's awesome.

01:15:26.024 --> 01:15:27.257
I think it's awesome too.

01:15:27.259 --> 01:15:28.792
I think it smells like cats
in here.

01:15:28.794 --> 01:15:30.394
It doesn't smell like cats.

01:15:30.396 --> 01:15:32.363
I think it... I think it
honestly smells like a zoo.

01:15:32.365 --> 01:15:33.364
No.
I love wood paneling.

01:15:33.366 --> 01:15:34.832
Wood paneling is amazing.

01:15:34.834 --> 01:15:37.201
You don't see that.
"I love wood."

01:15:37.203 --> 01:15:39.103
Honestly, Kate,
this place smells like rhinos.

01:15:39.105 --> 01:15:40.171
No.

01:15:50.216 --> 01:15:52.017
It's great, like I said.
The wood paneling.

01:15:52.019 --> 01:15:53.585
If you help me do the taps,
I'll do the taps.

01:15:53.587 --> 01:15:55.053
Yeah, I'll help.

01:15:55.055 --> 01:15:56.421
We just need stools
and the sign.

01:15:56.423 --> 01:15:57.557
Yeah, we can pull
some stuff from work.

01:15:57.559 --> 01:15:59.325
Just let me know.

01:15:59.327 --> 01:16:00.960
Is that everything?
That's everything, yeah.

01:16:00.962 --> 01:16:02.428
Oh, my God, you're a hero.

01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:03.830
Thank you guys so much.
You're welcome.

01:16:03.832 --> 01:16:05.131
I really appreciate it.

01:16:05.133 --> 01:16:06.466
We're gonna go out,
as per the uge,

01:16:06.468 --> 01:16:08.101
get some drinks,
so if you want to come,

01:16:08.103 --> 01:16:09.369
just shoot me a text
or something.

01:16:09.371 --> 01:16:10.905
Cool.
Yeah, sounds fun. Thank you.

01:16:10.907 --> 01:16:12.139
All right, enjoy the new place.

01:16:12.141 --> 01:16:13.140
All right, bye.

01:16:13.142 --> 01:16:14.642
Bye.

01:16:27.857 --> 01:16:28.990
Is it okay?

01:16:28.992 --> 01:16:30.625
Yeah, it just hurts.

01:16:33.863 --> 01:16:35.297
I might have...

01:16:35.299 --> 01:16:37.098
in one of the boxes,
there's, like, Tylenol.

01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:38.334
I don't know where it is,
though.

01:16:38.336 --> 01:16:40.069
It's all right.
Thanks, man.

01:16:45.208 --> 01:16:46.876
Mm.

01:16:46.878 --> 01:16:48.411
Well, we did it.

01:16:48.413 --> 01:16:49.979
Yeah, thank you.

01:16:49.981 --> 01:16:51.481
Thank you.

01:16:53.985 --> 01:16:56.053
Oh, sorry, my elbow
was pushing against your rib.

01:16:56.055 --> 01:16:57.454
Ugh.

01:16:57.456 --> 01:17:01.491
I seriously want to say
that I apologize.

01:17:01.493 --> 01:17:02.960
For what?

01:17:02.962 --> 01:17:04.227
For my elbow
going into your rib.

01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:07.498
Oh. Ow!

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:08.499
Don't.

01:17:08.501 --> 01:17:11.402
So should we shower up?

01:17:11.404 --> 01:17:13.137
You want to take a shower?

01:17:13.139 --> 01:17:14.906
Yeah.

01:17:14.908 --> 01:17:17.041
Take you out to that nice meal
I promised you.

01:17:17.043 --> 01:17:18.644
Why don't we just go have beer
with the guys?

01:17:18.646 --> 01:17:19.645
No. Pass.

01:17:19.647 --> 01:17:21.313
Why not?

01:17:21.315 --> 01:17:23.515
Because
I don't want to fucking see...

01:17:23.517 --> 01:17:26.485
I barely like Frank and Mike.

01:17:26.487 --> 01:17:28.988
I don't like Dave.

01:17:28.990 --> 01:17:30.422
We're gonna see them
tomorrow anyway.

01:17:30.424 --> 01:17:32.025
I kind of feel like

01:17:32.027 --> 01:17:33.628
I'm gonna have a drink
with them, though.

01:17:36.497 --> 01:17:37.497
You should come, though.

01:17:37.499 --> 01:17:39.532
You should totally come.

01:17:39.534 --> 01:17:42.002
Have fun.

01:17:43.005 --> 01:17:44.004
No, you should come.

01:17:44.006 --> 01:17:45.339
We'll, like, play pool.

01:17:45.341 --> 01:17:46.707
Oh, right on, sweet.
I feel like it.

01:17:46.709 --> 01:17:48.509
That sounds really cool, man.
Great.

01:17:48.511 --> 01:17:50.511
Play some pool with the guys,
and then just see what happens.

01:17:50.513 --> 01:17:52.046
Play some...

01:17:52.048 --> 01:17:53.414
Don't do that.
Don't be shitty, please.

01:17:53.416 --> 01:17:54.415
We'll just goof around
with the guys.

01:17:54.417 --> 01:17:56.050
Don't do that.

01:17:56.052 --> 01:17:57.385
And we'll pretend like
there was nothing weird

01:17:57.387 --> 01:17:58.386
about just going
out with the guys.

01:17:58.388 --> 01:18:00.055
Why is there something weird?

01:18:00.057 --> 01:18:01.556
Because we had plans.
That's what humans do.

01:18:01.558 --> 01:18:03.225
We make plans,
then we follow through.

01:18:03.227 --> 01:18:05.027
But if you want to go out
with the guys, then...

01:18:05.029 --> 01:18:06.328
Stop. Stop it.

01:18:06.330 --> 01:18:08.163
Then do
whatever the fuck you want.

01:18:08.165 --> 01:18:09.998
Stop, you're not allowed
to make me feel bad about this.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.266
I'm kind of allowed
to do whatever I want.

01:18:11.268 --> 01:18:12.301
No, you're really not.

01:18:12.303 --> 01:18:13.503
You're really not allowed

01:18:13.505 --> 01:18:15.038
to make me feel bad
about something.

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:16.672
I haven't done anything wrong,
Luke.

01:18:16.674 --> 01:18:17.707
You realize that, right?

01:18:17.709 --> 01:18:19.742
I haven't betrayed you.

01:18:19.744 --> 01:18:22.278
There's nothing that you can say
that I've done that's wrong.

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:24.380
I am a single human being
hanging out with my friends.

01:18:24.382 --> 01:18:26.116
I agree.

01:18:26.118 --> 01:18:28.018
Okay, you may have
some other shit to deal with.

01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:29.086
Don't... don't...

01:18:29.088 --> 01:18:30.754
That has nothing to do with me.

01:18:30.756 --> 01:18:32.489
I don't want to have one
of these big things with you.

01:18:32.491 --> 01:18:34.258
I'm just saying.

01:18:34.260 --> 01:18:36.226
I know you like the...
I'm not having a big thing.

01:18:36.228 --> 01:18:37.761
Don't... just...
you don't have to touch me.

01:18:37.763 --> 01:18:40.265
I think maybe
you should just go.

01:18:40.267 --> 01:18:43.268
Oh, would you please
get a hold of this moment?

01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:45.003
Would you please
get a hold of this moment?

01:18:45.005 --> 01:18:46.638
No, I refuse
to be made to feel bad.

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:48.106
I don't have to be made
to feel bad.

01:18:48.108 --> 01:18:50.075
Good for you.
Stop it!

01:18:50.077 --> 01:18:52.610
Stop doing
the fucking face and voice!

01:18:52.612 --> 01:18:54.513
That's not what I sound like,
okay?

01:18:54.515 --> 01:18:57.116
I am not a bad person, okay?

01:18:57.118 --> 01:18:58.784
You're my friend.
I agree.

01:18:58.786 --> 01:19:01.353
And you're not allowed to make
me feel like a fucking slut

01:19:01.355 --> 01:19:03.022
for fucking who I want,

01:19:03.024 --> 01:19:05.024
because I'm allowed to,
because I am single.

01:19:05.026 --> 01:19:07.761
You are not.

01:19:07.763 --> 01:19:08.795
Don't do that.

01:19:08.797 --> 01:19:10.230
What?

01:19:10.232 --> 01:19:11.512
I'm just
telling the truth, so...

01:19:14.735 --> 01:19:16.136
Don't do that.

01:19:16.138 --> 01:19:17.704
You made your own bed,
all right?

01:19:17.706 --> 01:19:19.206
And you fucking slept in it.

01:19:19.208 --> 01:19:22.877
Well, you didn't stop me.

01:19:24.413 --> 01:19:25.446
All right, Kate.

01:19:25.448 --> 01:19:26.547
All right.

01:19:27.549 --> 01:19:30.418
Sorry it ended so bad tonight.

01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:32.553
It wasn't my intent.
Have fun.

01:19:32.555 --> 01:19:34.423
Go home...

01:19:34.425 --> 01:19:35.591

No, everything's okay.

01:20:50.539 --> 01:20:52.606

01:20:59.783 --> 01:21:01.149
Hey.

01:21:01.151 --> 01:21:02.750
What are you doing home, Jill?

01:21:02.752 --> 01:21:03.751
Are you okay?

01:21:03.753 --> 01:21:04.819
Yeah, just...

01:21:04.821 --> 01:21:06.221
How come you're crying?

01:21:06.223 --> 01:21:07.655
The trip was just shitty.
Just...

01:21:07.657 --> 01:21:08.857
It was?

01:21:08.859 --> 01:21:10.426
Needed to come home, you know?

01:21:10.428 --> 01:21:12.261
Did anything happen,
or was it just bad?

01:21:12.263 --> 01:21:13.529
It just...

01:21:13.531 --> 01:21:15.898
It just sucked.
It just sucked.

01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:18.567
Were there, like, fights,
or did something...

01:21:21.472 --> 01:21:23.740
Careful.
Like, I ripped it with a nail.

01:21:23.742 --> 01:21:25.375
Okay.

01:21:25.377 --> 01:21:27.477
Oh, Jesus.

01:21:30.781 --> 01:21:32.482
You okay, Jill?

01:21:32.484 --> 01:21:33.950
Yeah.

01:21:33.952 --> 01:21:35.886
When we were in Michigan,
something happened.

01:21:35.888 --> 01:21:40.491
And I needed to come home
and tell you, um...

01:21:44.229 --> 01:21:47.765
I went on that hike with Chris,

01:21:47.767 --> 01:21:50.769
and, uh, we ended up kissing.

01:21:50.771 --> 01:21:53.639
And, um...

01:21:55.742 --> 01:21:59.845
And I just needed to come
home and tell you that...

01:21:59.847 --> 01:22:01.580
I needed to tell you that

01:22:01.582 --> 01:22:04.884
and that I'm really sorry,
and I really fucked up.

01:22:04.886 --> 01:22:05.885
I want to be with you.

01:22:05.887 --> 01:22:08.588
I want to...

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:10.790
I just couldn't not tell you.

01:22:17.699 --> 01:22:19.233
I-I didn't want to tell you,

01:22:19.235 --> 01:22:20.467
but it just felt worse
and worse,

01:22:20.469 --> 01:22:21.969
and I had to just...

01:22:21.971 --> 01:22:24.938
I just had to come home
and tell you.

01:22:31.847 --> 01:22:34.049
Is that it?

01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:41.923
I don't know.

01:22:41.925 --> 01:22:44.493
I... yeah?

01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:48.431
Are you in love with him
at all?

01:22:48.433 --> 01:22:49.665
No, no.

01:22:49.667 --> 01:22:51.567
No, not at all.
Not at all.

01:22:51.569 --> 01:22:55.938
It was just, like,
a really pathetic,

01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:59.376
gross thing to do.

01:23:00.545 --> 01:23:02.746
And...

01:23:02.748 --> 01:23:04.915
You're okay, Jill.

01:23:53.468 --> 01:23:55.770
So I say
we strike while the iron's hot.

01:23:55.772 --> 01:23:58.372
You know, maybe even as early
as next week, hopefully?

01:23:58.374 --> 01:24:00.608
We go out there
to Three Floyds,

01:24:00.610 --> 01:24:02.076
and maybe, you know,
leave early,

01:24:02.078 --> 01:24:03.845
like around 3:00,
next Thursday or Friday,

01:24:03.847 --> 01:24:05.514
whatever you think works...

01:24:05.516 --> 01:24:07.616

you know, a lot of the guys.
