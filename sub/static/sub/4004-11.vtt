WHY IS THAT?

02:53.750 --> 02:55.041
HERE IT IS.

02:55.041 --> 02:57.333
LOOK AT THIS.
LOOKS LIKE A PARTIAL FOOTPRINT.

02:57.333 --> 02:59.834
WHAT IF THE VIGILANTE
IS ONE OF THEIR VICTIMS?

02:59.834 --> 03:02.417

03:02.417 --> 03:03.500
NATURAL.

03:03.500 --> 03:05.583
- UHH!
- YOU OKAY?

REGARDING ALEX TILDEN--
IT WAS REALLY HELPFUL.

03:46.750 --> 03:49.041
- THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.
- WE FOLLOWED UP IMMEDIATELY.

03:49.041 --> 03:50.333
WE WENT TO HIS HOUSE, BUT...

03:50.333 --> 03:51.625
IT LOOKED LIKE
WE HAD JUST MISSED HIM.

03:51.625 --> 03:52.834
- OH, THAT'S UNFORTUNATE.

03:52.834 --> 03:54.375
- YEAH, IT IS, BECAUSE...

03:54.375 --> 03:56.792
HE SEEMS TO HAVE DISAPPEARED
OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH.

03:56.792 --> 03:57.875

04:25.417 --> 04:27.083
I GAVE YOU MY DNA!

04:27.083 --> 04:30.625
WHAT WERE THE RESULTS?
GO ON, REMIND ME.

04:30.625 --> 04:34.083
- YOUR DNA WASN'T FOUND
ON ANY OF THE BARREL GIRLS.

04:34.083 --> 04:36.333
- THAT'S CORRECT,
SO ALL THIS RIGHT HERE

04:36.333 --> 04:38.375
IS A COLOSSAL WASTE
OF MY TIME AND YOURS.

04:38.375 --> 04:40.083
- WELL, I'VE GOT
NOTHING BUT TIME.

SO YOU CAN KEEP
FOOLING EVERYBODY

04:41.542 --> 04:43.917

04:48.083 --> 04:49.500

A BIT OF FAME,

AND PEOPLE LATCH ONTO YOU
IN VARIOUS TWISTED WAYS.

04:53.291 --> 04:54.291
- I'D BE CAREFUL
IF YOU WERE YOU.

04:54.291 --> 04:55.375

WHO'S TRYING TO AVOID

04:56.583 --> 04:59.625

OF HER OWN SMALL LIFE.

04:59.625 --> 05:01.500

GOT AWAY.

I CAN HELP YOU WITH.

05:04.667 --> 05:06.959
- AND NOW SHE'S HUNTING DOWN
THE PEOPLE THAT TOOK HER.

05:06.959 --> 05:10.750
AND PEOPLE ALL AROUND YOU
ARE DROPPING LIKE FLIES.

05:10.750 --> 05:12.834
YOU COULD BE NEXT.

05:12.834 --> 05:15.250
- SERIOUSLY, I'LL BE FINE.

05:15.250 --> 05:16.959
IT'S YOU
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT.

05:16.959 --> 05:18.291
- DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU.

05:24.583 --> 05:26.000
- JORDAN CHASE...

05:26.000 --> 05:28.834
WE KNOW EXACTLY
WHERE HE IS.

05:28.834 --> 05:30.458
- YEAH, BUT...

05:30.458 --> 05:33.125
THERE'S NO WAY
TO GET TO HIM.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.166
THE ENTIRE TOP FLOOR
IS GUARDED.

05:35.166 --> 05:37.709
- ELEVATORS?

05:37.709 --> 05:39.500
- MONITORED.

05:40.834 --> 05:43.250
- STAIRS?

05:43.250 --> 05:44.750
- LOCKED FROM THE INSIDE.

05:44.750 --> 05:47.333
- YEAH.

05:47.333 --> 05:48.959
BUT YOU KNOW
HOW TO PICK LOCKS.

05:51.667 --> 05:52.792
- [sighs]

05:55.709 --> 05:58.875
NOT WITHOUT SETTING OFF
THE FIRE ALARM.

05:58.875 --> 06:03.291

06:03.291 --> 06:05.291
- OKAY.

06:05.291 --> 06:08.500
SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO GET HIM TO COME OUT.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.875
- HOW?

06:10.875 --> 06:14.166
HE HAS EVERYTHING
HE NEEDS UP THERE.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.792
- NOT EVERYTHING.

06:16.792 --> 06:18.750
ME.

06:18.750 --> 06:20.166
HE WANTS ME.

06:20.166 --> 06:21.709
- NO.

06:21.709 --> 06:23.875
- THERE'S GOT TO BE A WAY
TO USE ME AS BAIT.

06:23.875 --> 06:26.375
IT WORKED WITH COLE.

06:26.375 --> 06:28.834

AS BAIT.

06:28.834 --> 06:30.000
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.875

06:31.875 --> 06:34.667
- YEAH, I DO.
I SAW YOU KILL ALEX TILDEN.

06:34.667 --> 06:36.208

EXTRA CAREFUL.

06:36.208 --> 06:40.000

JUST OUR EYES ON HIM.

06:40.000 --> 06:40.875

06:47.208 --> 06:48.875

ANYTHING?

SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE
I'M TAKING ADVANTAGE OF HER,

07:06.083 --> 07:07.917
BUT IT'S FOR THE BEST.

07:07.917 --> 07:09.792
SHE'S NOT LIKE US.

07:09.792 --> 07:11.583
- "US."

07:23.000 --> 07:25.375
OH, UH...

07:25.375 --> 07:29.417

IN THE ROOM.

07:29.417 --> 07:31.917
THE BABY MONITOR
IS PICKING UP THE SIGNAL.

07:31.917 --> 07:34.917
SOMEBODY'S WATCHING US.

07:38.834 --> 07:41.333
JORDAN HAS TO BE
BEHIND THIS...

07:41.333 --> 07:42.500
AND CLOSE BY.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.542
WIRELE CAMERAS
HAVE A LIMITED RANGE,

07:44.542 --> 07:47.875
THEIR SIGNAL ROUTED
TO A RECORDING UNIT...

07:47.875 --> 07:49.875
IN A VACANT APARTMENT...

07:49.875 --> 07:52.583
A MOTOR HOME.

07:55.083 --> 07:56.583
A VAN.

08:19.458 --> 08:21.333
IT COULD BE ANYWHERE.

08:30.709 --> 08:32.333

- HEY.

08:50.458 --> 08:53.083
- MY UNION APPEAL'S
BEEN DENIED.

08:53.083 --> 08:56.667
I AM NOW
OFFICIALLY TERMINATED.

08:56.667 --> 08:58.166
SO HOW'S YOUR DAY?

08:58.166 --> 09:00.333

09:00.333 --> 09:01.500
- GOOD, THEN...

09:01.500 --> 09:03.875
- 30 YEARS OF PUTTING
BAD GUYS AWAY,

09:03.875 --> 09:07.083
THIS IS WHAT THEM COCKSUCKERS
UPSTAIRS DO TO ME--

09:07.083 --> 09:09.000
TAKE MY PENSION,
WIPE THEIR ASS WITH IT,

09:09.000 --> 09:10.959
AND JUST FLUSH IT
RIGHT ON DOWN THE SHITTER.

09:10.959 --> 09:12.834
- LOOK, I GOT TO GET INSIDE.

09:12.834 --> 09:14.750
- I NEED YOUR HELP ON A BUST.

09:14.750 --> 09:16.041
- A BUST?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

09:16.041 --> 09:17.375
- SOMETHING BIG,

09:17.375 --> 09:18.792
SOMETHING BIG ENOUGH
TO MAKE THEM STAND UP

09:18.792 --> 09:20.000
AND TAKE NOTICE,

09:20.000 --> 09:21.709
SOMETHING BIG ENOUGH

09:27.542 --> 09:28.875
I'M NOT A COP ANYMORE.

09:28.875 --> 09:30.959
NOW, I NEED A COP
TO MAKE THIS BUST.

09:30.959 --> 09:32.750
- NO.
FORGET IT.

09:34.208 --> 09:36.333
- YOU LITTLE FUCKING WIMP.

09:36.333 --> 09:39.375
YOU'RE UP TO YOUR ASS
IN ALLIGATORS WITH THIS THING,

09:39.375 --> 09:40.875
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

09:40.875 --> 09:44.000
SO YOU'RE GONNA MAKE THIS BUST,
AND I'M GONNA CALL YOU.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.041
YOU'D BEST COME RUNNING.

10:03.250 --> 10:04.834
- WHAT ARE YOU
IN THE MOOD FOR?

10:04.834 --> 10:06.542
- I'M THINKING SEAFOOD.

10:06.542 --> 10:10.250
IT'S A PERFECT NIGHT
TO GRILL.

10:10.250 --> 10:13.709
- I'LL GO CHECK
WHAT'S IN THE FRIDGE.

10:27.208 --> 10:28.792
- HARRISON'S BABY MONITOR

10:28.792 --> 10:30.625
MADE IT EASY TO PINPOINT
WHERE THIS WAS HIDDEN,

10:30.625 --> 10:32.417
BUT THE BIGGER PROBLEM
REMAINS--

10:32.417 --> 10:35.625
WHAT EXACTLY
HAS JORDAN HEARD,

10:35.625 --> 10:38.834
AND WHERE
ARE THOSE RECORDINGS?

10:42.333 --> 10:45.291
ON SECOND THOUGHT,
LET'S GO OUT TO EAT.

10:54.083 --> 10:55.625
[whispering]
IT'S NOT JORDAN. IT'S WORSE.

10:55.625 --> 10:57.333
IT'S SOMEONE
FROM MY OWN STATION.

10:57.333 --> 10:59.000
- WHAT?

10:59.000 --> 11:00.917
WHY WOULD SOMEBODY
FROM THE POLICE DEPARTMENT

11:00.917 --> 11:02.166
BUG YOUR APARTMENT?

11:02.166 --> 11:03.375
- I DON'T KNOW,

11:03.375 --> 11:04.917
BUT THERE'S A SERIAL NUMBER
ON THE CAMERA.

11:04.917 --> 11:06.500
I'LL GO IN TOMORROW
AND FIND OUT WHO CHECKED IT OUT.

11:06.500 --> 11:07.792
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.875
- THIS COULD HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH...

11:09.875 --> 11:12.542
MY SISTER'S THEORY.

11:12.542 --> 11:14.125
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

11:14.125 --> 11:16.166
- SHE HAS THIS THEORY
ABOUT...

11:16.166 --> 11:19.166
VIGILANTES HUNTING DOWN
THE RAPISTS.

11:19.166 --> 11:21.291
- SO YOU THINK
SHE PLANTED CAMERAS?

11:21.291 --> 11:24.333
- NO, IT'S NOT HER.
I'D KNOW.

11:24.333 --> 11:27.542
IT COULD BE ANYONE.

11:27.542 --> 11:29.250
- BUT HOW COULD THEY BE
ONTO US?

11:29.250 --> 11:32.166
WE'VE BEEN SO CAREFUL.
- I DON'T KNOW YET.

11:32.166 --> 11:33.625
THE ONE GOOD THING

11:33.625 --> 11:35.458
IS THAT NO ONE HAS SEEN
THOSE RECORDINGS YET.

11:35.458 --> 11:37.000
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

11:37.000 --> 11:40.500
- BECAUSE
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ARRESTED.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.000
- JORDAN IS GONNA GET AWAY
WITH EVERYTHING,

11:43.000 --> 11:44.417
AND WE'RE GONNA BE ARRESTED?

11:44.417 --> 11:46.875
- WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

11:46.875 --> 11:50.542
LOOK, FOR NOW, WE JUST PRETEND
LIKE EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

11:50.542 --> 11:51.834
IF WE HAVE SOMETHING
TO TALK ABOUT,

11:51.834 --> 11:53.625
WE TALK ABOUT IT OUT HERE,
WHERE IT'S SAFE

11:53.625 --> 11:55.500
- BUT WE WERE SO CLOSE.

11:57.208 --> 11:58.417
IT CAN'T END THIS WAY.

11:58.417 --> 12:01.917
- IT'S NOT GOING TO.

12:11.041 --> 12:12.709
I CHECKED
WITH THE APARTMENT MANAGER,

12:12.709 --> 12:16.667
THEN THE NEIGHBORS.

12:16.667 --> 12:18.625
THAT MOTOR HOME IS GONE.

12:18.625 --> 12:20.166
IT'S GOT TO BE
ONE OF THESE VANS.

12:20.166 --> 12:22.083
- YOU SAID THERE WERE
FOUR VANS LAST NIGHT.

12:22.083 --> 12:23.875
- IT'S DOWN TO THREE NOW.

12:23.875 --> 12:27.834
[cell phone ringing]
- I'LL KEEP CHECKING BACK.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.583
- SONYA, EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

12:29.583 --> 12:31.083
- EVERYTHING IS GREAT.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.834
ASTOR AND CODY ARE SPOILING
HARRISON SILLY.

12:33.834 --> 12:34.875
- GOOD.

12:34.875 --> 12:36.166
- HE'S TAKING
A LITTLE NAP NOW,

12:36.166 --> 12:38.458
SO I WAS JUST MAKING A LIST
FOR SUNDAY,

12:38.458 --> 12:40.709
AND I WONDERED, DO YOU HAVE
ANY SPECIAL REQUESTS?

12:40.709 --> 12:43.750
- SUNDAY?
- HARRISON'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.

12:43.750 --> 12:45.417
- OF COURSE!
RIGHT.

12:45.417 --> 12:47.834
HARRISON'S BIRTHDAY.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.875
- ASTOR AND CODY
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU.

12:49.875 --> 12:52.417
- I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO SEEING THEM TOO.

12:52.417 --> 12:55.250
BUT HOLD ON A SECOND.

12:55.250 --> 12:57.750
IT'S NOT SAFE
TO BRING EVERYONE HERE.

12:57.750 --> 12:59.917
- WE CAN GO TO THEM.
- YOU'RE COMING?

12:59.917 --> 13:02.542
- I JUST INVITED MYSELF.

13:02.542 --> 13:05.583
- SONYA, WE'RE GONNA HAVE
THE PARTY IN ORLANDO.

13:05.583 --> 13:07.834
- OH.
UH, OKAY.

13:07.834 --> 13:11.250
- IT'S--IT'S JUST EASIER THAN
MAKING EVERYONE DRIVE DOWN HERE.

13:11.250 --> 13:13.458
- PERFECT.

13:13.458 --> 13:15.250
[cell phone beeps]

13:15.250 --> 13:17.250
- PERFECT.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.291
COME ON,
I GOT TO GET TO WORK.

13:21.291 --> 13:24.917
KEEP AN EYE ON THESE VANS
AND CALL ME IF YOU SEE ANYTHING.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.458
[elevator bell dings]

13:29.458 --> 13:31.291
NO TORCHES, NO PITCHFORKS,

13:31.291 --> 13:33.792
NO ONE LOOKING AT ME
ANY DIFFERENTLY.

13:33.792 --> 13:35.792
- DEX, I NEED YOU.

13:35.792 --> 13:38.625
- IN A MINUTE.
I HAVE SOMETHING I NEED TO DO.

13:38.625 --> 13:40.417
FIND OUT WHO PLANTED
THOSE CAMERAS.

13:40.417 --> 13:42.458
- WE'RE ALL WAITING ON YOU.

13:42.458 --> 13:44.291
- THAT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD.

13:44.291 --> 13:47.834
[indistinct chatter]

13:53.625 --> 13:54.875
- SO, AS I WAS SAYING,

13:54.875 --> 13:57.667
EVERYTHING KEEPS LEADING
BACK TO JORDAN CHASE.

13:57.667 --> 13:59.625
- WHY WOULD HE BE RUNNING

13:59.625 --> 14:01.291
A RAPE CLUB
WITH THESE PUTOS?

14:01.291 --> 14:03.667
- I DON'T KNOW. BUT I'M
PRETTY FUCKING SURE HE IS.

14:03.667 --> 14:05.750
- WHERE ARE WE ON THE BANKER,
ALEX TILDEN?

14:05.750 --> 14:07.000
- HE'S GONE.
HE DISAPPEARED.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
- WE GOT HIS DNA
FROM A TOOTHBRUSH--

14:09.000 --> 14:11.041
TIES HIM TO THE BARREL GIRLS,
LIKE THE OTHERS,

14:11.041 --> 14:14.166
BUT NO CONNECTION TO JORDAN
THAT WE CAN FIND.

14:14.166 --> 14:15.417
- THEN I SUGGEST
YOU FIND THAT CONNECTION.

14:15.417 --> 14:16.917
- I'M ON IT.

14:16.917 --> 14:19.333
- AND THE DENTIST, MENDELL?
- HE'S THE ODD MAN OUT.

14:19.333 --> 14:20.625
HE DOESN'T SEEM
TO HAVE ANY CONNECTION

14:20.625 --> 14:21.959
TO ANY OF THE OTHER GUYS.

14:21.959 --> 14:23.709
- WELL, AGAIN,
LET'S FIND THAT CONNECTION.

14:23.709 --> 14:25.166
MORGAN, QUINN.
- WE GOT IT.

14:25.166 --> 14:27.083
- PHONE THE NEIGHBORS.
WAKE THE KIDS.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.208
KICK THE DOG.

14:28.208 --> 14:30.667
REMEMBER THAT MUDDY
FEMALE BOOT PRINT

14:30.667 --> 14:31.875
OUTSIDE OF TILDEN'S HOUSE?

14:31.875 --> 14:33.417
- YEAH, WE FOUND IT.

14:33.417 --> 14:35.667
- WELL, MY BROTHERS IN BLUE,

14:35.667 --> 14:38.291
IT...

14:38.291 --> 14:40.000
HAS A TWIN.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.542
FOUND IT OUTSIDE
THE VACANT HOUSE NEXT DOOR.

14:42.542 --> 14:44.542
- LET ME SEE THAT.

14:44.542 --> 14:46.375
- NATURALLY, I WENT INSIDE.

14:46.375 --> 14:48.041
THE DINING ROOM
WAS SPOTLESS,

14:48.041 --> 14:50.041
AND I MEAN RECENTLY CLEANED
KIND OF SPOTLESS,

14:50.041 --> 14:52.000
UNLIKE THE REST OF THE HOUSE.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.208
MY SCHNOZ ALSO DETECTED
THE SMELL OF BLEACH.

14:55.208 --> 14:57.542
- ONE MORE DAY, AND THE SMELL
WOULD HAVE DISSIPATED.

14:57.542 --> 14:58.959
- MY GUESS--

14:58.959 --> 15:01.458
THE VIGILANTE BROUGHT
YOUR MISSING BANKER OVER

15:01.458 --> 15:04.458
AND OFFED HIM RIGHT THERE
IN THE DINING ROOM.

15:04.458 --> 15:07.291
- EXCUSE ME,
DID I HEAR THE WORD...

15:07.291 --> 15:09.500
"VIGILANTE"?

15:11.375 --> 15:13.000
- [chuckles]

15:13.000 --> 15:16.625
IT WAS A THEORY
I WAS KEEPING TO MYSELF, BUT...

15:16.625 --> 15:20.417
IT'S OUT THERE, BUT WE MAY HAVE
A VIGILANTE ON OUR HANDS.

15:20.417 --> 15:22.375
I SENT MASUKA
OVER TO TILDEN'S

15:22.375 --> 15:24.375
TO SEE IF HE COULD COMB
FOR ANY EVIDENCE

15:24.375 --> 15:26.250
THAT A HOMICIDE
HAD TAKEN PLACE.

15:26.250 --> 15:27.333
- KEEP GOING.

15:27.333 --> 15:28.917
- PLEASE DON'T.

15:28.917 --> 15:31.458
- THERE ARE 13 DVDs...

15:31.458 --> 15:33.041
AND ONLY 12 VICTIMS.

15:33.041 --> 15:36.500
SO I'M THINKING THAT
ONE OF THE BARREL GIRLS ESCAPED,

15:36.500 --> 15:38.667
AND NOW SHE'S AFTER THE MEN
THAT ABDUCTED HER.

15:38.667 --> 15:41.000
AND SHE IS HUNTING THEM,
AND SHE IS KILLING THEM.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.709
- HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

15:43.709 --> 15:45.875
THE BARREL GIRLS
ARE ALL SLIGHT OF BUILD.

15:45.875 --> 15:48.750
ALEX TILDEN WAS, WHAT,
175 POUNDS?

15:48.750 --> 15:49.667
- MINIMUM.

15:49.667 --> 15:51.625
- MAYBE SHE HAD HELP.

15:51.625 --> 15:53.166
- LIKE WHO?

15:53.166 --> 15:54.583
- I DON'T KNOW.

15:54.583 --> 15:55.750
A...

15:55.750 --> 15:57.458
A MAN...

15:57.458 --> 15:59.458
SOMEONE SHE TRUSTS...

15:59.458 --> 16:02.166
SOMEONE WHO CARES
ABOUT HER--

16:02.166 --> 16:04.458
A FATHER, A BROTHER,

16:04.458 --> 16:07.250
HUSBAND, BOYFRIEND.

16:09.750 --> 16:12.917
- SO NOW IT'S VIGILANTES
AND LOVE.

16:12.917 --> 16:14.625
- YEAH, LIKE
ROMEO AND JULIET,

16:14.625 --> 16:16.834
EXCEPT THEY
DIDN'T KILL ANYONE.

16:16.834 --> 16:19.333
NO, MORE LIKE, UH,
BONNIE AND, UH...

16:19.333 --> 16:20.291
CLYDE.

16:20.291 --> 16:21.625
- GREAT.

16:21.625 --> 16:22.792
THEY ENDED UP DEAD

16:22.792 --> 16:24.583
IN A BULLET-RIDDLED CAR.

16:24.583 --> 16:25.959
- WE ALL HAVE OUR ASSIGNMENTS.

16:25.959 --> 16:27.166
LET'S GO.

16:51.083 --> 16:52.625
- CLOSER TO TEN MINUTES.

16:52.625 --> 16:55.166
SHE LIKES A CUP OF COFFEE
WITH HER SMOKE.

16:57.000 --> 17:01.041
BUT THAT'S MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME
TO SEE THAT...

17:01.041 --> 17:04.000
DETECTIVE JOSEPH QUINN
CHECKED OUT THE CAMERAS--

17:04.000 --> 17:05.750
THREE CAMERAS,
TO BE EXACT,

17:05.750 --> 17:08.000
TWO MICROPHONES,
A RECORDER--

17:08.000 --> 17:09.083
ONLY THREE DAYS AGO.

17:09.083 --> 17:11.291
MAYBE NO ONE'S SEEN
THE FOOTAGE YET.

17:14.375 --> 17:16.583
CASE NUMBER.

17:16.583 --> 17:18.583
IT'S FROM 1982,

17:18.583 --> 17:20.709
WHEN QUINN WAS IN GRADE SCHOOL
EATING PASTE.

17:20.709 --> 17:22.208
IT'S A FAKE.

17:30.166 --> 17:32.834
NO COURT ORDERS AUTHORIZED
FOR MY ADDRESS.

17:32.834 --> 17:34.417
THIS IS OFF THE BOOKS.

17:45.792 --> 17:47.875
QUINN'S DOING THIS
ON HIS OWN.

17:47.875 --> 17:49.834
LUMEN, PLANS FOR LUNCH?

17:58.291 --> 18:00.291
- START WITH THE HARD DRIVE.

18:00.291 --> 18:03.083
- YEAH, ANY STORAGE DEVICES,
VIDEO FILES,

18:03.083 --> 18:05.917
FLASH DRIVES.

18:05.917 --> 18:08.333
- WOW, THIS THING IS ANCIENT.

18:08.333 --> 18:09.750
WHO IS THIS GUY?

18:09.750 --> 18:11.291
- QUINN...

18:11.291 --> 18:14.291
MY SISTER'S PARTNER.

18:14.291 --> 18:16.667
- OH, WOW.

18:16.667 --> 18:18.250
ARE THEY CLOSE?

18:18.250 --> 18:21.250
- THEY USED TO BE.

18:21.250 --> 18:23.458
YOU GOT ANYTHING?

18:23.458 --> 18:25.750
- NOT MUCH IN THE WAY
OF VIDEO FILES.

18:25.750 --> 18:28.375
- ANYTHING OF US?

18:28.375 --> 18:29.625
- NO.

18:29.625 --> 18:30.959
JUST A CAT

18:30.959 --> 18:32.917
THAT HICCUPS AND FARTS
AT THE SAME TIME.

18:32.917 --> 18:34.834
[cat hiccups, farts]

18:34.834 --> 18:37.083
- CUTE.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.041
CHECK THE BEDROOM.

18:42.709 --> 18:45.792
YOU TAKE THE CLOSET.
I'LL CHECK THE DRAWERS.

18:55.959 --> 18:58.917
OH, SHIT.

18:58.917 --> 19:00.834
- WHAT IS IT?

19:00.834 --> 19:02.792
- US.
- THE MARINA.

19:02.792 --> 19:05.792
- THAT'S THE NIGHT
WE DUMPED COLE.

19:05.792 --> 19:08.083
HE'S BEEN WATCHING US
FOR WEEKS.

19:08.083 --> 19:10.750
- HE KNOWS EVERYTHING.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.000
WAIT, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
TAKE THEM WITH YOU?

19:14.000 --> 19:15.375
- TIP HIM OFF
THAT WE FOUND THEM?

19:15.375 --> 19:17.166
NO, HE'LL JUST PRINT MORE.

19:17.166 --> 19:18.834
WE HAVE TO FIND
THE DIGITAL SOURCE.

19:18.834 --> 19:22.792
- RIGHT.
FIND THE RECORDING EQUIPMENT.

19:30.291 --> 19:31.583
- WE'RE NOT OPEN ANYMORE.

19:31.583 --> 19:32.917
- MRS. MENDELL?

19:32.917 --> 19:34.542
LAURA MENDELL?

19:34.542 --> 19:36.208
- YES?

19:36.208 --> 19:38.291
- I'M DETECTIVE MORGAN.
THIS IS DETECTIVE QUINN.

19:38.291 --> 19:40.667
WE'D LIKE TO ASK YOU A COUPLE
OF QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND.

19:40.667 --> 19:43.291
- PLEASE, OKAY?
JUST NO MORE QUESTIONS.

19:43.291 --> 19:47.291
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS, OKAY?
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

19:47.291 --> 19:49.583
OF COURSE, I SHOULD HAVE.
- WHY IS THAT?

19:49.583 --> 19:53.333
- I MEAN, I WAS VERY NAIVE,
BUT NOW IT ALL MAKES SENSE.

19:53.333 --> 19:55.333
THOSE WEEKLONG FISHING TRIPS
HE USED TO TAKE?

19:55.333 --> 19:57.333
- HE'D GO WITHOUT YOU?
- OF COURSE WITHOUT ME.

19:57.333 --> 19:58.917
IT WAS JUST HIM
AND HIS BUDDIES.

19:58.917 --> 20:01.250
HE CALLED IT
HIS "MAN TIME."

20:01.250 --> 20:03.750
BUT, OF COURSE, THAT HAS
A WHOLE OTHER MEANING NOW.

20:03.750 --> 20:06.375
- DID HE EVER GIVE YOU NAMES
OF THE MEN ON THOSE TRIPS?

20:06.375 --> 20:08.291
- NO.
I NEVER MET ANY OF THEM.

20:08.291 --> 20:10.041
HE KEPT ME COMPLETELY
IN THE DARK

20:10.041 --> 20:13.709
ABOUT HIS WHOLE
CLOSETED GAY LIFE.

20:13.709 --> 20:16.250
I MEAN, WHY DIDN'T HE
JUST TELL ME?

20:16.250 --> 20:18.125
- ACTUALLY, MRS. MENDELL,

20:18.125 --> 20:20.208
WE HAVE INFORMATION
WHICH LEADS US TO BELIEVE

20:20.208 --> 20:22.166
YOUR HUSBAND WASN'T,
IN FACT, GAY.

20:22.166 --> 20:23.917
- THE CRIME SCENE
MAY HAVE BEEN ALTERED

20:23.917 --> 20:25.917
TO GIVE THAT IMPRESSION.

20:25.917 --> 20:29.417
BUT HE WAS LINKED
TO A SERIES OF RAPES.

20:29.417 --> 20:32.166
- AND MURDERS.

20:32.166 --> 20:34.333
- MY GOD.

20:36.208 --> 20:39.709
WHO IS THIS MAN I MARRIED?

20:39.709 --> 20:42.458
- I'M SORRY TO BRING YOU
THAT NEWS.

20:42.458 --> 20:45.709
BUT DO ANY OF THESE NAMES
SOUND FAMILIAR?

20:45.709 --> 20:47.250
BOYD FOWLER.

20:47.250 --> 20:49.875
COLE HARMON.
- NO, I DON'T KNOW THEM.

20:49.875 --> 20:52.041
- ALEX TILDEN.

20:52.041 --> 20:54.583
- JORDAN CHASE.

20:54.583 --> 20:56.166
- JORDAN CHASE?
- YES.

20:56.166 --> 20:59.041
- WELL, THAT'S HIM,
RIGHT THERE.

20:59.041 --> 21:01.125
- "BEST 2 MAN SAILING TEAM--

21:01.125 --> 21:02.875
DAN MENDELL
AND EUGENE GREER"?

21:02.875 --> 21:05.750
- JORDAN CHASE
IS EUGENE GREER...

21:05.750 --> 21:08.250
OR HE USED TO BE.

21:08.250 --> 21:09.834
DAN KNEW HIM
WHEN THEY WERE KIDS.

21:09.834 --> 21:11.750
IT WAS A REALLY BIG DEAL
TO HIM.

21:11.750 --> 21:13.417
- THAT'S OUR CONNECTION.

21:13.417 --> 21:15.250
- WHY DO YOU THINK THE WIFE
NEVER HAD A CLUE

21:15.250 --> 21:16.750
ABOUT WHAT WAS UP
WITH HER HUSBAND?

21:16.750 --> 21:18.000
I MEAN,
THIS BARREL-GIRL STUFF

21:18.000 --> 21:20.417
HAS GONE ON THE ENTIRE TIME
THEY WERE MARRIED.

21:20.417 --> 21:23.291
- HE WAS PROBABLY
A REALLY GOOD LIAR.

21:23.291 --> 21:25.083
MEN SOMETIMES HAVE
THAT ABILITY, YOU KNOW?

21:25.083 --> 21:26.583
IT WAS HIS FAULT, NOT HERS.

21:26.583 --> 21:29.083
- HOW DO YOU WANT TO GO
AT THIS EUGENE GREER THING?

21:29.083 --> 21:30.917
- JUST PULL UP
EVERYTHING WE CAN--

21:30.917 --> 21:33.041
SCHOOL RECORDS, JUVIE RECORDS.

21:33.041 --> 21:34.875
I FUCKING KNEW CHASE
WAS FULL OF SHIT.

21:34.875 --> 21:36.875
- WHO CREATES A NEW IDENTITY
FOR THEMSELVES?

21:36.875 --> 21:39.166
- A DIRT BAG
WHO HAS SOMETHING TO HIDE.

21:39.166 --> 21:41.959
I'VE GOT IT.

21:41.959 --> 21:44.417
[elevator bell dings]

21:52.625 --> 21:55.291
- JORDAN CHASE LIED
ABOUT KNOWING ALEX TILDEN.

21:55.291 --> 21:56.625
IN THE PAST TEN YEARS,

21:56.625 --> 21:58.625
TILDEN OVERSAW
SIX PROPERTIES

21:58.625 --> 22:00.625
PURCHASED
BY CHASE'S CORPORATION.

22:00.625 --> 22:02.208
- WELL, DAN THE DENTIST
ALSO KNEW HIM,

22:02.208 --> 22:03.750
AND JORDAN CHASE
IS AN ALIAS.

22:03.750 --> 22:05.125
THAT WHOLE BULLSHIT PERSONA

22:05.125 --> 22:06.667
THAT HE BUILT FOR HIMSELF
IS A LIE.

22:06.667 --> 22:08.458
- YEAH, HIS REAL NAME'S
EUGENE GREER.

22:08.458 --> 22:10.166
MENDELL AND CHASE
WERE FRIENDS AS KIDS.

22:10.166 --> 22:12.709
- SO WAIT--
THAT TIES JORDAN DIRECTLY

22:12.709 --> 22:15.709
TO EACH
OF THE BARREL GIRLS' RAPISTS.

22:15.709 --> 22:17.792
- YEAH, BUT STILL
ALL CIRCUMSTANTIAL,

22:17.792 --> 22:20.083
NOT ENOUGH TO BRING HIM IN.
- YEAH, BUT IT'S ENOUGH TO BRING

22:20.083 --> 22:21.667
HIS LYING ASS IN
FOR QUESTIONING.

22:21.667 --> 22:23.875
WE JUST GOT TO KEEP PUSHING
AT HIM, SCARE HIM A LITTLE BIT

22:23.875 --> 22:25.458
TILL HE STARTS MAKING
SOME MISTAKES.

22:25.458 --> 22:28.041
- DEB'S CLOSING IN ON CHASE.

22:28.041 --> 22:30.417
QUINN'S CLOSING IN ON ME.

22:30.417 --> 22:32.166
TIME'S RUNNING OUT
FOR BOTH OF US.

22:37.542 --> 22:39.250
HEY, ANY GOOD NEWS?

22:39.250 --> 22:41.291
- UH, YEAH,
WE'VE CONNECTED JORDAN CHASE

22:41.291 --> 22:42.542
TO ALL OF THE RAPISTS,

22:42.542 --> 22:45.375
SO I'M ABOUT TO NAIL
THIS FUCK TO THE WALL.

22:45.375 --> 22:47.834
- GOOD.

22:47.834 --> 22:50.333
- WHAT--WHAT'S UP?
I'M KIND OF BUSY.

22:50.333 --> 22:52.500
- JUST WONDERING
IF YOU WANT TO GO WITH ME

22:52.500 --> 22:55.083
TO ORLANDO ON SUNDAY
FOR HARRISON'S BIRTHDAY.

22:55.083 --> 22:57.417
- OH. WELL...

22:57.417 --> 22:59.542
I DO, BUT...

22:59.542 --> 23:00.959
- YOU HAVE OTHER PLANS
WITH QUINN?

23:00.959 --> 23:03.208
- WHAT?
NO, IT--IT'S WITH WORK.

23:03.208 --> 23:05.458
IT'S THE CASE.

23:05.458 --> 23:08.208
BESIDES, QUINN'S THE LAST PERSON
THAT YOU'D WANT TO HAVE THERE.

23:08.208 --> 23:09.667
- OH?
- TRUST ME.

23:09.667 --> 23:11.792
- SO IT'S OVER?

23:11.792 --> 23:14.834
- YES.

23:14.834 --> 23:16.375
NO.
FUCK, I DON'T KNOW.

23:16.375 --> 23:18.041
IT'S COMPLICATED.

23:18.041 --> 23:19.458
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME.

23:19.458 --> 23:22.917
- HE LIED TO ME
ABOUT SOMETHING.

23:22.917 --> 23:25.500
- MUST HAVE BEEN
SOMETHING BIG.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.583
- HE LIED TO ME ABOUT YOU.

23:28.583 --> 23:30.709
- ABOUT ME?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

23:30.709 --> 23:33.583
- QUINN HAD THIS...

23:33.583 --> 23:35.500
IDIOT NOTION THAT...

23:35.500 --> 23:38.083
YOU WERE SOMEHOW CONNECTED
TO RITA'S DEATH.

23:39.709 --> 23:40.709
- [scoffs]

23:44.583 --> 23:47.041
THAT'S--
- IT'S CRAZY, I KNOW.

23:47.041 --> 23:48.250
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

23:48.250 --> 23:50.709
- BECAUSE...

23:50.709 --> 23:53.250
BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN
THROUGH ENOUGH.

23:53.250 --> 23:55.041
AND I JUST FOUND OUT.

23:57.542 --> 24:00.917
WHEN HE FINALLY TOLD ME,
I FELT SO BETRAYED,

24:00.917 --> 24:03.250
BECAUSE...

24:03.250 --> 24:05.709
AS MUCH AS I DON'T WANT
TO ADMIT IT,

24:05.709 --> 24:07.542
I REALLY CARE ABOUT HIM.

24:07.542 --> 24:09.875
- "CARE," PRESENT TENSE?

24:11.250 --> 24:13.291
- IT'S COMPLICATED,
REMEMBER?

24:16.333 --> 24:18.208
I THOUGHT I KNEW HIM,

24:18.208 --> 24:20.250
AND HE KEPT TELLING ME
HE LOVED ME.

24:21.792 --> 24:23.208
BUT WHAT HE DID,

24:23.208 --> 24:25.917
I MEAN, I CAN'T HAVE
SOMEBODY LIKE THAT.

24:25.917 --> 24:28.500
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T LIE TO
SOMEBODY THAT YOU'RE CLOSE TO.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.417
YOU HAVE THEIR BACK.

24:30.417 --> 24:34.500
I NEED SOMEONE
I CAN TRUST 100%.

24:36.667 --> 24:39.041
LIKE THIS.
[laughs]

24:39.041 --> 24:40.125
- A BOOT PRINT?

24:40.125 --> 24:42.458
- THE VIGILANTE...

24:42.458 --> 24:45.750
SHE HAS SOMEONE IN HER LIFE,
A GUY WHO'S HELPING HER,

24:45.750 --> 24:49.125
SOMEONE THAT WOULD DO ANYTHING
AND EVERYTHING FOR HER.

24:49.125 --> 24:51.709
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

24:51.709 --> 24:54.959
- HONESTLY,
I DON'T KNOW, BUT...

24:54.959 --> 24:57.625
WHAT THEY'RE DOING
TAKES DEVOTION.

24:57.625 --> 25:00.542
TO KILL SOMEONE TOGETHER,
THAT'S SOME PRETTY SERIOUS SHIT.

25:00.542 --> 25:04.250
- IS THAT WHAT LUMEN
AND I HAVE--SERIOUS SHIT?

25:04.250 --> 25:06.041
- HE'S RISKING HIS LIFE.

25:06.041 --> 25:08.000
HE'S PUTTING EVERYTHING
ON THE LINE

25:08.000 --> 25:09.959
TO MAKE WHAT HAPPENED
TO HER RIGHT.

25:13.250 --> 25:15.834
AS CRAZY
AS THAT SOUNDS, WHAT--

25:15.834 --> 25:19.125
WHAT WORD WOULD YOU USE
TO DESCRIBE THAT BUT "LOVE"?

25:21.917 --> 25:25.125
[laughs]

25:25.125 --> 25:27.458
IT'S PRETTY FUCKED UP,
ISN'T IT?

25:29.125 --> 25:32.041
- YEAH, PRETTY FUCKED UP.

25:34.375 --> 25:36.208
- KIND OF BEAUTIFUL TOO.

25:42.959 --> 25:44.291
- JUST GOT THIS IN.

25:44.291 --> 25:46.166
IT'S HANDMADE.
IT'S VERY CHIC.

25:46.166 --> 25:50.500
- UM, IT'S NOT QUITE ME.
- PERHAPS ONE OF THE RINGS.

25:50.500 --> 25:53.250
- HOW ABOUT THAT?

26:01.208 --> 26:04.208
IT'S NICE...

26:04.208 --> 26:05.500
SMALL ENOUGH TO CARRY,

26:05.500 --> 26:07.333
LOCKING PIN,
STAINLESS-STEEL BLADE.

26:07.333 --> 26:10.041
HOW'S IT FEEL?
- GOOD.

26:10.041 --> 26:12.667
- WE'LL TAKE IT.

26:13.959 --> 26:16.667
- THANK YOU.
- SURE.

26:23.333 --> 26:27.792
IT'S JUST AN HOUR OR SO
TILL QUINN GETS OFF WORK.

26:27.792 --> 26:30.250
IF HE DECIDES TO CHECK
HIS RECORDING EQUIPMENT TONIGHT,

26:30.250 --> 26:32.792
I SHOULD BE THERE.

26:34.625 --> 26:38.250
- WHAT IS QUINN AFTER?
WHAT DOES HE WANT WITH US?

26:38.250 --> 26:40.875
- HE DOESN'T WANT US.
HE WANTS ME.

26:40.875 --> 26:44.083
HE WAS COMING AFTER ME
BEFORE WE EVEN MET.

26:44.083 --> 26:46.583
I DIDN'T MEAN FOR YOU
TO GET CAUGHT UP IN THIS.

26:46.583 --> 26:48.750
YOU SHOULD LEAVE.

26:48.750 --> 26:50.667
- YOU TRIED THAT
ONCE BEFORE, REMEMBER?

26:50.667 --> 26:53.375
YOU TRIED TO SHIP ME AWAY.
- THAT WAS DIFFERENT.

26:53.375 --> 26:55.417
I DON'T WANT YOU TO LEAVE...

26:55.417 --> 26:57.542
FOR GOOD...

26:59.417 --> 27:03.041
JUST TILL I DEAL WITH THIS.

27:03.041 --> 27:05.375
- DEAL WITH IT HOW?

27:05.375 --> 27:07.583
- I DON'T KNOW--
WHATEVER NEEDS TO BE DONE.

27:09.417 --> 27:11.125
- [sighs]
I APPRECIATE THE OFFER,

27:11.125 --> 27:13.667
BUT I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

27:13.667 --> 27:17.792
- LUMEN, IT'S GETTING DANGEROUS.
- [scoffs] GETTING DANGEROUS?

27:17.792 --> 27:19.542
I'M NOT WALKING AWAY.

27:19.542 --> 27:22.792
WE'RE A TEAM.

27:22.792 --> 27:25.000
- WE HAVE SERIOUS SHIT.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.625
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

27:27.625 --> 27:30.166
- IT'S JUST SOMETHING
DEB SAID ABOUT US.

27:30.166 --> 27:32.625
- YOU TOLD HER ABOUT US?

27:32.625 --> 27:35.417
- NO, SHE WAS TALKING
ABOUT THE VIGILANTES.

27:35.417 --> 27:36.583
SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT US

27:36.583 --> 27:38.041
WITHOUT KNOWING
SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT US.

27:38.041 --> 27:39.583
- OH.

27:45.125 --> 27:49.166
[sighs]

27:49.166 --> 27:51.083
MAYBE...

27:51.083 --> 27:52.875
WE SHOULD BOTH TAKE OFF.

28:00.542 --> 28:03.333
- GET ON A CRUISE SHIP.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.667
- HOP A FREIGHTER.

28:05.667 --> 28:08.166
- STEAL A TUGBOAT.

28:16.417 --> 28:20.417
- YOU SAID THAT
YOU DIDN'T WANT ME TO LEAVE.

28:20.417 --> 28:22.291
DOES THAT MEAN
THAT YOU WANT ME TO STAY?

28:22.291 --> 28:24.291
- I DO.

28:32.333 --> 28:35.166
WE SHOULD GO.

28:39.250 --> 28:41.792
- OKAY, SO EUGENE GREER

28:41.792 --> 28:44.709
GREW UP IN SOME REDNECK TOWN
NEAR TALLAHASSEE.

28:44.709 --> 28:47.542
HE HAD A SINGLE MOM,
NOW DEAD, NO SIBLINGS,

28:47.542 --> 28:49.417
PRETTY NONDESCRIPT CHILDHOOD.

28:49.417 --> 28:53.125
MOVED TO MIAMI WHEN HE WAS 18,
DROPPED ABOUT 100 POUNDS,

28:53.125 --> 28:55.166
CHANGED HIS NAME
TO JORDAN CHASE,

28:55.166 --> 28:57.208
PRETTY MUCH
REINVENTED HIMSELF.

28:57.208 --> 29:01.583
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE
BEFORE-AND-AFTER PHOTOS.

29:01.583 --> 29:03.208
- OOH.

29:03.208 --> 29:04.500
- LIKE A DIFFERENT PERSON.

29:04.500 --> 29:05.875
- I THINK HE MIGHT HAVE HAD

29:05.875 --> 29:07.583
SOME PLASTIC SURGERY
ALONG THE WAY.

29:07.583 --> 29:09.000
- LOOK AT THIS.

29:13.083 --> 29:15.458
- WHEN THEY'D BE OFF DOING
THEIR THING AT THE SAME TIME,

29:15.458 --> 29:17.125
EACH OF THE BARREL GIRLS
DISAPPEARED.

29:17.125 --> 29:18.709
- FUCK,
THEY DID THIS FOR YEARS.

29:18.709 --> 29:19.834
- MM-HMM.

29:19.834 --> 29:22.417
[cell phone vibrates]

29:22.417 --> 29:24.250
I GOT TO TAKE THIS.

29:39.917 --> 29:44.000
- I'M, UH, HAVING
A REALLY TOUGH TIME HERE.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.917
- DOING WHAT?

29:45.917 --> 29:48.083
- THIS...

29:48.083 --> 29:49.250
BEING WITH YOU.

29:49.250 --> 29:51.083
- YEAH, WELL, YOU SHOULD
HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT BEFORE.

29:51.083 --> 29:52.583
- I'M SORRY.

29:52.583 --> 29:55.625
I FUCKED UP, I KNOW.

29:55.625 --> 29:57.542
I DO DUMB THINGS.

29:57.542 --> 29:59.083
I'M A DUMB GUY.

29:59.083 --> 30:01.792
BUT THE ONE THING
I DID RIGHT

30:01.792 --> 30:05.959
WAS TO GET YOU
TO ALMOST LIKE ME...

30:05.959 --> 30:08.083
'CAUSE I REALLY LOVE YOU.
- DON'T, QUINN.

30:08.083 --> 30:10.458
- NO, I MEAN IT.

30:10.458 --> 30:13.291
THERE AREN'T
MANY WOMEN LIKE YOU.

30:13.291 --> 30:15.000
I KNOW THAT.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.625
YOU'RE MORE LIKE...

30:17.625 --> 30:19.625
A GUY.
- A GUY?

30:19.625 --> 30:23.583
- YOU DON'T PLAY GAMES
WHERE I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

30:23.583 --> 30:25.417
WHAT IT IS
YOU'RE REALLY THINKING.

30:25.417 --> 30:27.625
YOU JUST SAY IT,

30:27.625 --> 30:30.000
USUALLY WITH A LOT
OF REALLY FILTHY WORDS

30:30.000 --> 30:33.041
THAT I'VE NEVER HEARD BEFORE.

30:33.041 --> 30:37.375
YOU'RE THE FIRST WOMAN WHO'S
EVER CALLED ME ON MY BULLSHIT...

30:37.375 --> 30:39.792
AND MADE ME TAKE
A HARD LOOK AT MYSELF.

30:39.792 --> 30:44.041
IT'S MADE ME
A BETTER PERSON, I THINK.

30:44.041 --> 30:47.834
I JUST DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU,
THAT'S ALL.

30:47.834 --> 30:49.834
- BAD NEWS.

30:51.375 --> 30:53.500
NOT ONLY HAS JORDAN
DECLINED OUR REQUEST

30:53.500 --> 30:54.667
FOR ANOTHER INTERVIEW,

30:54.667 --> 30:58.333
BUT HE JUST BOOKED A MULTI-CITY
SPEAKING DEAL IN EUROPE.

30:58.333 --> 31:00.000
SOUNDS LIKE HE'S ON THE RUN.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.333
- NO FUCKING WAY.

31:01.333 --> 31:03.667
- AS OF TOMORROW,
HE IS UNTOUCHABLE,

31:03.667 --> 31:06.542
UNLESS WE CAN FIND A WAY
TO KEEP HIM HERE.

31:06.542 --> 31:07.875
- BUT LIKE WE KEEP SAYING,

31:07.875 --> 31:09.667
WE STILL DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
TO ARREST HIM.

31:09.667 --> 31:10.959
- NO, BUT, UH...

31:10.959 --> 31:13.417
WE CAN GROUND HIM
AS A MATERIAL WITNESS.

31:13.417 --> 31:15.667
WE JUST HAVE TO GET
A COURT ORDER.

31:15.667 --> 31:18.333
- SHOULD WE GO TO LAGUERTA?
- NO.

31:18.333 --> 31:20.542
SHE SHOOTS ME DOWN EVERY TIME.
SHE WON'T HELP.

31:20.542 --> 31:22.166
I CAN GET IT MYSELF.

31:29.834 --> 31:32.125
- THE ONLY VAN THAT REMAINS
AFTER 24 HOURS

31:32.125 --> 31:33.375
JUST HAPPENS
TO BE A RENTAL.

31:33.375 --> 31:35.166
JUDGING BY
THE AMOUNT OF DUST,

31:35.166 --> 31:38.000
IT'S BEEN SITTING THERE
CLOSE TO A WEEK.

31:42.875 --> 31:44.208
AND HERE COMES QUINN,

31:44.208 --> 31:47.834
CHECKING IN BEFORE HE HEADS
TO THE STATION.

31:51.083 --> 31:53.250
I NEVER WANTED IT
TO COME TO THIS.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.208
[stun gun buzzing]

32:01.208 --> 32:02.959
[groans]

32:37.917 --> 32:41.083
[cell phone ringing]

32:47.291 --> 32:48.709
- HELLO?

32:48.709 --> 32:51.083
- [voice trembling]
LUMEN, IT'S ME, EMILY.

32:51.083 --> 32:52.000
- WHAT'S WRONG?

32:52.000 --> 32:54.417
- I GOT A CALL
FROM JORDAN CHASE.

32:54.417 --> 32:56.458
HE KNOWS
I TALKED TO YOU.

32:56.458 --> 32:58.375
- WHAT? HOW?

32:58.375 --> 32:59.500
- I DON'T KNOW.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.000
YOU TELL ME.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.417
- I DIDN'T TALK TO HIM.

33:02.417 --> 33:03.542
- WHAT IS GOING ON?

33:03.542 --> 33:05.875
I'M SCARED.

33:05.875 --> 33:07.583
HE SCARED ME.

33:07.583 --> 33:09.417
- EMILY, I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT'S GOING ON.

33:11.625 --> 33:13.542
- I'M GOING TO THE POLICE.

33:13.542 --> 33:15.667
I'LL TELL THEM EVERYTHING.
- NO, NO, DON'T DO THAT.

33:15.667 --> 33:17.333
- WHY?
THEY'LL PROTECT ME.

33:17.333 --> 33:19.208
- EMILY, IT'LL JUST MAKE
THINGS WORSE.

33:19.208 --> 33:20.291
WE'LL PROTECT YOU.

33:20.291 --> 33:21.625
- HOW?

33:21.625 --> 33:23.542
JORDAN IS TOO POWERFUL.

33:23.542 --> 33:25.333
HE HAS PEOPLE.

33:25.333 --> 33:26.417
- EMILY...

33:26.417 --> 33:28.458
- YOU KNOW
WHAT HE DID TO US.

33:28.458 --> 33:31.041
- JUST STAY IN YOUR HOUSE.
WAIT FOR US.

33:31.041 --> 33:32.834
WE'LL BE THERE
AS SOON AS WE CAN.

33:32.834 --> 33:35.792
PLEASE, JUST TELL ME
THAT YOU'LL WAIT FOR US.

33:39.166 --> 33:40.417
- OKAY.

33:40.417 --> 33:42.458
I'LL WAIT, BUT HURRY.

33:42.458 --> 33:45.125
PLEASE HURRY.

33:47.792 --> 33:50.000
[cell phone beeps]
- VERY NICE.

33:52.750 --> 33:55.250
YOU'RE QUITE THE ACTRESS.

33:55.250 --> 33:57.041
[line ringing]

33:57.041 --> 33:58.166
- DEXTER MORGAN.

33:58.166 --> 33:59.917
- PLEASE LEAVE
A MESSAGE AT THE TONE.

33:59.917 --> 34:01.750
[beep]
- DEXTER, WHERE ARE YOU?

34:01.750 --> 34:04.083
EMILY CALLED, AND JORDAN KNOWS
SHE TALKED TO US.

34:04.083 --> 34:05.250
WE HAVE TO GO SEE HER.

34:09.500 --> 34:11.750
- [groans]

34:25.625 --> 34:27.667
[cell phone ringing]

34:27.667 --> 34:29.750
- I HOPE YOU GOT VOICE MAIL.

34:29.750 --> 34:32.041
[ringing continues]

34:32.041 --> 34:34.000
- YOUR QUINN'S FRIEND.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.375
- THAT WOULD BE ME.

34:35.375 --> 34:38.917
F.Y.I.,
STAN LIDDY IS MY NAME.

34:38.917 --> 34:41.750
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

34:41.750 --> 34:44.041
- I JUST NEED YOU
TO RELAX.

34:44.041 --> 34:45.542
I'M TAKING US
TO A LITTLE PLACE,

34:45.542 --> 34:48.250
HAVE A LITTLE PRIVATE CHAT,
THAT'S ALL.

34:48.250 --> 34:50.291
- WHY?

34:50.291 --> 34:51.959
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

34:51.959 --> 34:54.000
- 'CAUSE OUR MUTUAL FRIEND,
JOEY QUINN,

34:54.000 --> 34:55.208
HIRED ME
TO LOOK INTO YOU,

34:55.208 --> 34:57.542
AND I GUESS YOU KNOW
I FOUND OUT SOME THINGS.

34:57.542 --> 35:00.041
SO I JUST NEED YOU
TO LIE THERE AND RELAX.

35:00.041 --> 35:02.125
I DON'T WANT TO ZAP YOU AGAIN,
BUT I WILL IF I HAVE TO.

35:14.166 --> 35:17.500
[cell phone ringing]

35:17.500 --> 35:18.959
- WHAT?

35:18.959 --> 35:20.750
- COME ON, NOW, JOEY.

35:20.750 --> 35:23.917
IS THAT ANY WAY TO TALK
TO YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND?

35:23.917 --> 35:25.542
- I TOLD YOU,
I DON'T WANT--

35:25.542 --> 35:26.583
- SHUT UP
AND LISTEN UP.

35:26.583 --> 35:28.542
YOU GET YOUR ASS
IN YOUR CAR

35:28.542 --> 35:30.792
AND YOU DRIVE ON DOWN
TO THE FUEL DOCKS

35:30.792 --> 35:32.291
AT BAYFRONT PARK.

35:32.291 --> 35:34.291
THAT BIG BUST
I WANT YOU TO MAKE--

35:34.291 --> 35:36.250
I NEED YOU TO COME DOWN HERE
AND MAKE IT NOW.

35:36.250 --> 35:37.709
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING,

35:37.709 --> 35:38.959
BUT YOU GOT TO STOP IT
WITH THIS SHIT.

35:38.959 --> 35:41.375
- AW, HORSESHIT.
NOBODY'S STOPPING NOTHING.

35:41.375 --> 35:42.625
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO HIRED ME.

35:42.625 --> 35:44.125
- AND THEN I FIRED YOU.

35:44.125 --> 35:46.792
- LISTEN, BOY, THIS IS GOING
DOWN WITH OR WITHOUT YOU.

35:46.792 --> 35:48.083
NOW, YOU DON'T GET DOWN HERE

35:48.083 --> 35:49.750
FASTER THAN
A FUCKING JACKRABBIT,

35:49.750 --> 35:51.291
I'M CALLING IN ANOTHER COP,

35:51.291 --> 35:53.792
AND THEN THERE'S NO TELLING
HOW THIS IS GONNA SPIN OUT.

35:53.792 --> 35:55.083
- JESUS, LIDDY, JUST--

35:55.083 --> 35:57.125
- JESUS AIN'T GOT
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

35:57.125 --> 36:00.417
OLD FUEL DOCKS,
BAYFRONT PARK, NOW.

[cell phone beeps]

36:04.959 --> 36:07.083
- FUCK.

36:07.083 --> 36:09.166
- YOUR BUDDY QUINN
IS ON HIS WAY.

36:09.166 --> 36:11.166
- DIDN'T SOUND
LIKE HE WANTS TO COME.

36:11.166 --> 36:12.333
[cell phone chimes]

36:12.333 --> 36:14.458
- WELL, YOU'RE
A REAL POPULAR FELLA.

36:14.458 --> 36:16.208
SONYA.

36:16.208 --> 36:17.333
WHO'S SONYA?

36:17.333 --> 36:18.667
- MY NANNY.

36:18.667 --> 36:20.208
- NANNY.

36:20.208 --> 36:21.458
WELL, SONYA WANTS TO KNOW

36:21.458 --> 36:25.000
IF YOU WANT A MAGICIAN
FOR THE PARTY.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.625
OF COURSE YOU DO.

36:26.625 --> 36:29.166
"YES TO MAGICIAN."

36:31.750 --> 36:34.125
WELL, NOW...

36:34.125 --> 36:36.709
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT TO SHOW YOU.

36:43.333 --> 36:45.542
LOOKY HERE AT THIS.

36:51.875 --> 36:53.208
AIN'T THAT NEAT?

36:54.875 --> 36:57.417
AND THAT'S JUST A TINY BIT
OF WHAT I RECORDED.

36:57.417 --> 37:00.709
BUT I ONLY GOT
ONE PROBLEM HERE.

37:00.709 --> 37:02.417
I DIDN'T HAVE
NO SEARCH WARRANT,

37:02.417 --> 37:04.625
AND THESE PEOPLE
ARE STICKLERS FOR RULES,

37:04.625 --> 37:07.333
WHICH IS WHY...

37:07.333 --> 37:10.083
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME
A FULL CONFESSION.

37:10.083 --> 37:12.875
[knocking]

37:17.000 --> 37:18.375
- WHERE'S DEXTER?

37:18.375 --> 37:20.500
- HE'S NOT HERE.

37:20.500 --> 37:22.291
- NO, I NEED YOU BOTH.

37:22.291 --> 37:24.417
YOU SAID
YOU WOULD PROTECT ME.

37:24.417 --> 37:26.208
- EMILY, IT'S OKAY.
CALM DOWN.

37:26.208 --> 37:27.875
- YOU HAVE TO CALL HIM.

37:27.875 --> 37:30.583
MAKE HIM COME, NOW.

37:30.583 --> 37:34.166
- OKAY.

37:34.166 --> 37:36.750
OKAY, MAYBE I SHOULD
JUST GO GET HIM.

37:36.750 --> 37:39.375
- MAYBE NOT.

37:41.250 --> 37:42.917
- I AIN'T STUPID.

37:42.917 --> 37:44.208
I KNOW YOU'RE THINKING,

37:44.208 --> 37:45.875
"I GOT NO REASON
TO MAKE A FULL CONFESSION."

37:45.875 --> 37:47.917
SO I'M GONNA
GIVE YOU A REASON.

37:47.917 --> 37:49.000
LUMEN WALKS FREE.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.959
- WHY SHOULD I TRUST YOU?

37:50.959 --> 37:52.875
- 'CAUSE I DON'T GIVE A SHIT
ABOUT HER.

37:52.875 --> 37:54.417
AND I DON'T GIVE A SHIT
ABOUT YOU EITHER.

37:54.417 --> 37:57.625
I JUST WANT MY GODDAMN JOB
ON THE POLICE FORCE BACK.

37:57.625 --> 37:59.291
I BRING IN
SOMEBODY LIKE YOU,

37:59.291 --> 38:01.250
I GET MY PICTURE
IN THE NEWS AND TELEVISION,

38:01.250 --> 38:02.625
EVERYBODY THINKS
I'M A GODDAMN HERO,

38:02.625 --> 38:05.041
EVERYBODY LOVES ME,
AND THEY HAVE TO HIRE ME BACK.

38:05.041 --> 38:07.750
SO I DON'T NEED YOUR GIRL.

38:07.750 --> 38:09.750
[camera beeps]

38:09.750 --> 38:11.083
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

38:11.083 --> 38:12.375
OOH!

[Dexter grunting]

38:31.667 --> 38:34.166

38:50.583 --> 38:52.333
- GO AWAY, QUINN.

38:52.333 --> 38:55.458
DON'T MAKE THIS
ANY WORSE.

38:58.667 --> 39:02.458

- LIDDY, IT'S QUINN.

39:44.125 --> 39:46.875
YOU'RE REALLY STARTING
TO FUCKING PISS ME OFF.

[cell phone beeping]

40:13.166 --> 40:14.500
- DEXTER, WHERE ARE YOU?

40:14.500 --> 40:17.000
EMILY CALLED.
JORDAN KNOWS SHE TALKED TO US.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.458
WE HAVE TO GO SEE HER.

40:18.458 --> 40:20.458
[cell phone beeps]

40:36.834 --> 40:38.750
[camera whirs]

40:41.500 --> 40:44.083

TO DEAL WITH YOU.

- I'M ON MY WAY.

41:05.792 --> 41:08.000
- MORGAN...

41:08.000 --> 41:10.792
MY OFFICE.

41:14.125 --> 41:15.792
I GOT A CALL EARLIER
FROM THE JUDGE

41:15.792 --> 41:17.959
YOU PETITIONED
FOR YOUR COURT ORDER.

41:17.959 --> 41:19.125
- WHEN'S IT COMING?

41:19.125 --> 41:21.250
- IT'S NOT.

41:21.250 --> 41:22.792
- WHAT?

41:22.792 --> 41:25.625
- YOUR REQUEST
TO DETAIN JORDAN CHASE

41:25.625 --> 41:27.625
AS A MATERIAL WITNESS
WAS DENIED.

41:27.625 --> 41:31.083
- THAT FUCK IS SCHEDULED TO FLY
OUT OF HERE ONE-WAY TODAY.

41:31.083 --> 41:32.375
THIS WAS OUR SHOT.

41:32.375 --> 41:33.959
- I UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE UPSET,

41:33.959 --> 41:36.417
BUT WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
IS WHY YOU DIDN'T COME TO ME.

41:36.417 --> 41:39.041
- YOU'RE KIDDING.
- I'M ASKING.

41:39.041 --> 41:41.417
- YOU ARE THE LAST PERSON
I THINK OF

41:41.417 --> 41:42.750
WHEN I NEED SUPPORT.

41:42.750 --> 41:45.834
- DETECTIVE, YOU'VE BEEN
ON THE FORCE LONG ENOUGH

41:45.834 --> 41:48.458
TO KNOW THAT SITUATIONS
ARE RARELY BLACK AND WHITE.

41:48.458 --> 41:50.542
POLITICS COME INTO PLAY.

41:50.542 --> 41:52.667
- THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT I SIGNED UP TO BE USED.

41:52.667 --> 41:53.917
- WE ALL GET USED,

41:53.917 --> 41:56.250
AND IN THIS INSTANCE,
YOU SHOULD HAVE USED ME.

41:56.250 --> 41:57.500
- YOU MADE IT VERY CLEAR

41:57.500 --> 41:59.000
THAT YOU DON'T SUPPORT
MY VIGILANTE THEORY.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.333
- AND I'M STILL NOT SURE
THAT THERE'S ANYTHING TO IT,

42:02.333 --> 42:06.333
BUT I HAVE ALWAYS TRUSTED
YOUR INSTINCTS AS A COP.

42:06.333 --> 42:08.959
- HOO.

42:08.959 --> 42:11.417
[sighs]

42:11.417 --> 42:12.792
YOU KNOW, AT ONE POINT,

42:12.792 --> 42:15.917
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT
WE WERE FRIENDS.

42:15.917 --> 42:18.333
- WELL, DETECT--

42:18.333 --> 42:21.291
DEBRA, I'M SORRY...

42:21.291 --> 42:23.583
IF I BETRAYED
THAT FRIENDSHIP.

42:23.583 --> 42:25.166
- OKAY.

42:25.166 --> 42:26.583
- WAIT.

42:26.583 --> 42:28.208
- WHAT? WHAT?

42:28.208 --> 42:29.625
WHAT IS IT?

42:29.625 --> 42:30.875
- HERE.

42:30.875 --> 42:33.417
- WHAT IS THIS?
- IT'S YOUR COURT ORDER...

42:33.417 --> 42:35.834
FROM A DIFFERENT JUDGE
WHO OWED ME A FAVOR.

42:38.709 --> 42:40.291
- [sighs]

42:40.291 --> 42:42.500
FUCK ME.

42:43.875 --> 42:46.458
NOW I'M THE ASSHOLE, RIGHT?

42:46.458 --> 42:48.208
- YOU BETTER GET GOING
IF YOU WANT TO CATCH JORDAN.

42:48.208 --> 42:50.375
- RIGHT.

42:50.375 --> 42:53.500
[door opens, closes]

43:00.709 --> 43:02.375
- LUMEN?

43:13.208 --> 43:15.583
- WHAT COULD HE BE DOING
THAT IS SO IMPORTANT

43:15.583 --> 43:17.875
THAT HE WOULD LET YOU
COME HERE BY YOURSELF?

43:17.875 --> 43:19.417
- I DON'T KNOW.

43:19.417 --> 43:22.166
- YES, YOU KEEP SAYING THAT.

43:22.166 --> 43:26.583
YOU'RE SURPRISINGLY
SHORT OF ANSWERS.

43:26.583 --> 43:28.208
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD LET ME
CALL HIM.

43:28.208 --> 43:30.208
- YES, BRILLIANT,

43:30.208 --> 43:33.125
BECAUSE YOU CERTAINLY
WOULDN'T TIP HIM OFF IN ANY WAY.

43:33.125 --> 43:34.250
- I COULD TRY CALLING HIM.

43:34.250 --> 43:35.709
- QUIET, PLEASE.

43:35.709 --> 43:38.291
- ARE YOU MAD AT ME?

43:38.291 --> 43:40.250
I DID EXACTLY
WHAT YOU TOLD ME TO DO.

43:40.250 --> 43:41.417
- PLEASE, SHUT UP.

43:41.417 --> 43:43.375
- I'M JUST TRYING TO--
- SHUT UP!

43:46.834 --> 43:48.291
- IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

43:48.291 --> 43:49.667
- OF COURSE
IT'S YOUR FAULT!

43:52.625 --> 43:53.667

[groaning]

43:55.750 --> 43:56.917
- [growls]

44:00.583 --> 44:03.250
I FIND THIS
PROFOUNDLY DISTASTEFUL.

44:03.250 --> 44:05.166
I'VE NEVER HAD
TO DO ANYTHING BEFORE!

44:05.166 --> 44:07.792
NOW I HAVE NO CHOICE.
I CAN'T LEAVE ANY WITNESSES.

44:07.792 --> 44:10.250
- NO, YOU SAID
YOU WOULDN'T KILL HER.

44:11.542 --> 44:13.000
- [gasping]

44:35.250 --> 44:37.750
- LUMEN.

44:37.750 --> 44:39.792
LUMEN?

44:49.667 --> 44:54.458
IS THIS THE ONLY KIND OF LOVE
I'LL EVER FIND...

44:54.458 --> 44:56.208
THE KIND
THAT ENDS IN BLOOD?

45:02.417 --> 45:04.333
[sirens wailing]

45:04.333 --> 45:06.667
[jet engines whirring]

45:14.083 --> 45:16.583
[wailing stops]

45:16.583 --> 45:19.208
- CAN I HELP YOU?
- I'M LOOKING FOR JORDAN CHASE.

45:19.208 --> 45:21.834
I HAVE A COURT ORDER THAT
PREVENTS HIM FROM LEAVING MIAMI.

45:21.834 --> 45:23.542
- WELL, I GUESS
I CAN GO HOME, THEN.

45:23.542 --> 45:24.709
- IS HE ON THE PLANE?

45:24.709 --> 45:26.458
- NO. I HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE HE IS.

45:26.458 --> 45:28.542
WE WERE SCHEDULED
TO FLY OUT OVER AN HOUR AGO,

45:28.542 --> 45:29.917
AND HE NEVER SHOWED UP.

45:36.875 --> 45:40.208
- EMILY WAS KILLED
WITH TWO BLOWS.

45:44.625 --> 45:46.041
LUMEN WAS HERE--

45:46.041 --> 45:48.083
MULTIPLE FOOTPRINTS
IN THE BLOOD,

45:48.083 --> 45:49.458
A SCUFFLE.

45:49.458 --> 45:53.250
MORE BLOOD, NOT FROM EMILY,
LEADING OUT.

45:54.959 --> 45:57.750
SHE WAS RUNNING.

46:03.625 --> 46:05.625
SHE'S PUTTING UP A FIGHT.

46:05.625 --> 46:07.875
LUMEN.
