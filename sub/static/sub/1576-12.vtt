00:03.384 --> 00:04.550
Okay, here it is.

00:04.552 --> 00:06.385
This is Louis' first
science fair project.

00:06.387 --> 00:07.319
You're gonna love it.

00:07.321 --> 00:08.520
Wow.

00:08.522 --> 00:10.322
Louis made this all by himself.

00:10.324 --> 00:11.757
Last time I was here,

00:11.759 --> 00:14.660
he got the straw from his
juice box stuck in his nose.

00:14.662 --> 00:17.296
He also got it unstuck.

00:18.398 --> 00:19.732
Uh, check it out.

00:19.734 --> 00:22.301
So, uh, so we'll take
a piece of bread, all right?

00:22.303 --> 00:24.403
Put it in the mouth,

00:24.405 --> 00:26.505
where the saliva will
start to dissolve the bread.

00:26.507 --> 00:28.140
And then it'll travel
down to the stomach,

00:28.142 --> 00:32.110
where the acids will break down
the complex carbohydrates.

00:32.113 --> 00:34.480
At which point it will
move past the appendix,

00:34.482 --> 00:36.782
which does nothing.

00:36.784 --> 00:38.851
Yeah, we should rename
that the Alan.

00:38.853 --> 00:41.620
Uh, and then it'll go
to the small intestines,

00:41.622 --> 00:43.255
the large intestines,
where finally...

00:47.694 --> 00:49.461
Oh, dear God.

00:49.463 --> 00:50.963
Uh, no, it's okay,
it's a Hershey's Kiss.

00:50.965 --> 00:52.097
Okay.

00:52.099 --> 00:55.567
So the reason I came
over is to tell you--

00:55.569 --> 00:57.202
we are ready to start
the final steps

00:57.204 --> 00:59.238
for you to officially
adopt Louis.

00:59.240 --> 01:02.441
Oh, my God, I'm gonna
Hershey's Kiss my pants.

01:02.443 --> 01:05.277
But before the
adoption is final,

01:05.279 --> 01:07.713
I want you to tell Louis
you two aren't gay.

01:07.715 --> 01:10.082
Are you sure that this is
the best time to do that?

01:10.084 --> 01:11.383
I mean, I haven't even
talked to him

01:11.385 --> 01:12.718
about the birds
and the bees,

01:12.720 --> 01:14.520
let alone the bees
and the bees.

01:14.522 --> 01:16.855
I know there is never
a perfect time

01:16.857 --> 01:20.059
to tell your son his two dads
aren't gay...

01:21.327 --> 01:23.929
...but it'll be more harmful
the longer you wait.

01:23.931 --> 01:25.864
Yeah, but it's just,
like, h-how do I tell him?

01:25.866 --> 01:28.233
Um, does Hallmark make
a "Sorry, son,

01:28.235 --> 01:30.169
it turns out
I'm straight" card?

01:30.171 --> 01:31.937
You've been a fantastic father
so far.

01:31.939 --> 01:33.439
I am confident
you will handle this

01:33.441 --> 01:34.840
with the utmost attention
and care.

01:34.842 --> 01:35.874
Walden?

01:35.876 --> 01:37.943
Him I'm worried about.

01:37.945 --> 01:39.044
Sorry I'm late.

01:39.046 --> 01:40.212
Uh, I took Louis
to the mall

01:40.214 --> 01:41.447
to get him some
new school clothes.

01:41.449 --> 01:42.881
He's trying them on
right now.

01:42.883 --> 01:46.151
Plus there was a new kiosk
that will bedazzle anything.

01:46.153 --> 01:48.554
Got an iPhone case for my boo.

01:49.622 --> 01:52.057
Now, I'm gonna bedazzle
your cheek with some sugar.

01:53.294 --> 01:57.329
Alan, as your social worker,
I cannot accept gifts.

01:57.331 --> 01:59.398
And as your "boo,"
hell no.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.801
I can't believe
I'm just realizing this,

02:02.803 --> 02:05.170
but the perfect person
to date a social worker

02:05.172 --> 02:06.772
is a needy child.

02:06.774 --> 02:09.140
We were just discussing
that it would be

02:09.143 --> 02:10.943
in the best interest
of Louis to tell him

02:10.945 --> 02:12.578
you two aren't actually gay.

02:12.580 --> 02:14.646
Oh, I agree
100 percent.

02:14.648 --> 02:16.949
I mean, it's not like anyone was
buying either one of us

02:16.951 --> 02:18.584
as a gay man anyway.

02:18.586 --> 02:21.420
Ooh, that top is
fierce, girl. Rawr.

02:22.889 --> 02:25.424
Louis, could you come
in here for a second?

02:25.426 --> 02:26.859
Oh, oh, we're doing
it right now?

02:26.861 --> 02:30.629
It will be such a relief
to discontinue this charade.

02:35.735 --> 02:37.503
What are you wearing?

02:37.505 --> 02:41.840
Alan says between business
casual and country club chic.

02:41.842 --> 02:43.142
Now turn around.

02:46.579 --> 02:49.314
He's "bedazzle-ous."

02:50.183 --> 02:51.783
Okay, should we
tell him now?

and there's nothing for me here.

04:42.526 --> 04:44.226
I mean, most of my memories
involve a time

04:44.228 --> 04:46.362
when I was drinking
really heavily,

04:46.364 --> 04:47.429
and those aren't pretty.

04:47.431 --> 04:49.431
I mean, the bar
by my house has a drink

04:49.433 --> 04:50.833
called "The Lyndsey Special."

04:50.835 --> 04:52.701
It's a bottle of Merlot,
a shot of vodka

04:52.703 --> 04:55.738
and a scrunchie to hold your
hair back while you throw up.

04:55.740 --> 04:57.840
So where do you think
you're gonna go?

04:57.842 --> 05:00.309
Well, I have family
in Arizona, so...

05:00.311 --> 05:02.478
not there.

05:02.480 --> 05:04.680
Ah, you know, I just,
I can't believe it.

05:12.123 --> 05:13.422
Mm.

05:13.424 --> 05:15.357
Anyway, I just wanted
to let you know.

05:15.359 --> 05:17.292
This is gonna
be so strange.

we weren't together,

it was nice knowing
you were nearby.

17:33.270 --> 17:34.937
Walden?
What are you doing here?

17:34.939 --> 17:38.341
I am on the
"Alan Harper Apology Tour."

17:39.910 --> 17:41.144
Uh, but this is gonna require

17:41.146 --> 17:42.311
a little bit of
audience participation.

17:42.313 --> 17:44.480
When I say "Alan,"
you say "idiot."

17:44.482 --> 17:46.182
Alan.
Idiot.

17:46.184 --> 17:47.917
Alan.
Idiot.

17:47.919 --> 17:49.352
This is fun. Come in.

17:51.422 --> 17:53.322
Wow, this is nice.

17:53.324 --> 17:56.059
And it doesn't smell
like cat urine at all.

17:56.061 --> 17:57.894
So what do you want, Walden?

17:57.896 --> 17:59.729
I realize that Alan--

17:59.731 --> 18:00.930
Idiot.

18:02.533 --> 18:06.202
Look, I-I realize that
he can do some stupid things.

18:06.204 --> 18:08.471
And I'm-I'm sure you've seen
his helicopter dance,

18:08.473 --> 18:10.873
where he uses his penis
as the propeller.

18:11.742 --> 18:13.576
Actually, I haven't.

18:14.445 --> 18:15.745
Neither have I.

18:17.147 --> 18:19.715
I realize how angry
you must be with him.

18:19.717 --> 18:21.017
But that has nothing to do

18:21.019 --> 18:22.685
with the kind of father
I can be to Louis.

18:22.687 --> 18:24.087
I know that.

18:24.089 --> 18:25.054
It's just that Alan--

18:25.056 --> 18:26.089
Idiot.

18:26.091 --> 18:27.557
Ha!

18:27.559 --> 18:29.192
He makes me crazy.

18:29.194 --> 18:30.393
I-I just said that!

18:30.395 --> 18:32.161
In-in fact, I hit a lifeguard

18:32.163 --> 18:34.564
with a patio chair saying that.

18:34.566 --> 18:36.599
Look, Walden,
at the end of the day,

18:36.601 --> 18:38.935
I'm not gonna let my anger
prevent a child

18:38.937 --> 18:40.470
from being placed
in a good home.

18:40.472 --> 18:41.604
Thank God.

18:41.606 --> 18:44.373
I just... I've never realized

18:44.375 --> 18:46.476
how much another person
can mean to me.

18:46.478 --> 18:48.711
That is so sweet.

18:49.546 --> 18:51.514
Why can't anybody

18:51.516 --> 18:53.583
ever think that about me?

18:54.751 --> 18:57.086
I am such
a loser!

18:57.088 --> 18:59.789
No, you're not a loser,
Ms. McMartin.

18:59.791 --> 19:01.891
Yes, I am!

19:01.893 --> 19:03.759
I thought I hit rock bottom

19:03.761 --> 19:07.130
by dating an old guy
who can't get a boner.

19:08.832 --> 19:12.168
It turns out, rock bottom
is getting dumped

19:12.170 --> 19:14.770
by the old guy
who can't get a boner.

19:16.507 --> 19:18.407
What is wrong with me?

19:18.409 --> 19:19.709
Nothing.

19:19.711 --> 19:22.411
Come on, you're smart
and you're fun...

19:22.413 --> 19:23.880
And, oh, by the way,

19:23.882 --> 19:25.615
you are way too pretty for Alan.

19:25.617 --> 19:27.850
Oh.

19:27.852 --> 19:29.585
So are you.

19:29.587 --> 19:30.720
See?

19:30.722 --> 19:32.321
Now there's that smile.

19:32.323 --> 19:33.823
Come on,
now, now...

19:33.825 --> 19:35.892
any guy would be lucky
to be with you.

19:35.894 --> 19:37.627
Oh, you're just saying that.

19:37.629 --> 19:38.828
No, you're awesome.

19:38.830 --> 19:40.530
And what you do for a living,
helping those kids,

19:40.532 --> 19:41.831
changing their lives,

19:41.833 --> 19:44.033
putting your hand
on my leg...

19:47.104 --> 19:48.104
Wow.

19:49.641 --> 19:51.574
I can't believe this.

19:51.576 --> 19:53.809
You're not
the only one.

19:53.811 --> 19:55.211
I don't want you to worry.

19:55.213 --> 19:56.612
I'm not going to let the fact

19:56.614 --> 19:58.948
that we are in a relationship
affect Louis.

19:58.950 --> 20:01.517
Learned that lesson, am I right?

20:02.820 --> 20:05.054
Yeah.

20:05.056 --> 20:07.456
Relationship.

20:07.458 --> 20:08.925
Okay.

20:08.927 --> 20:11.928
I am going to go...
Where?

20:11.930 --> 20:13.696
Where are you going?

20:13.698 --> 20:16.399
To the bathroom.

20:16.401 --> 20:18.434
Oh, okay.

20:19.437 --> 20:21.704
Hurry back.

20:21.706 --> 20:24.407
I'll miss you.

20:24.409 --> 20:26.876
I'll miss you, too.

20:29.279 --> 20:31.547
Ooh, it's a little
chilly out there.

20:31.549 --> 20:34.050
I'm gonna
grab my pants.

20:34.052 --> 20:37.553
