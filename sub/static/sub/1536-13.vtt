00:01.000 --> 00:02.331
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.400 --> 00:04.641
Juliette, Adalind is back
in Portland.

00:04.720 --> 00:06.085
You need to be careful.

00:06.160 --> 00:07.366
She's in town with Viktor.

00:07.440 --> 00:11.047
If Adalind tries anything, I swear
to God I will rip her throat out.

00:16.360 --> 00:17.566
You haven't told the Grimm?

00:17.640 --> 00:18.846
No, I'm afraid to.

00:18.920 --> 00:20.251
I'm on my way home.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.049
Okay, the doors are locked,
I'll get my gun. Aah.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.930
If you wanna see
her alive, come alone.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.684
Juliette! Where is he?

00:31.080 --> 00:32.241
What the hell happened?

00:35.600 --> 00:38.126
"And glory like the phoenix
midst her fires,

00:38.280 --> 00:40.806
"Exhales her odors,
blazes, and expires."

00:58.840 --> 01:00.001
Sorry, I couldn't help it.

01:00.120 --> 01:01.565
We should've been
outta here hours ago.

01:01.640 --> 01:03.642
How long does it take you
to do inventory?

01:03.720 --> 01:04.721
Did you forget
how to count?

01:04.800 --> 01:06.928
Okay, it's 9:00 p.m.
Where do you gotta be?

01:07.000 --> 01:08.047
Come on.

01:08.120 --> 01:09.565
Let's be bad.

01:50.720 --> 01:53.121
This is the good stuff.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.964
We shouldn't be
in here.

01:55.520 --> 01:57.045
What was that?

01:58.080 --> 02:01.482
It's mood lighting.
Relax, just have a drink.

02:25.440 --> 02:27.647
What did you do
with the body?

02:27.720 --> 02:30.166
Never mind,
I don't wanna know.

02:34.600 --> 02:35.647
You Okay?

02:41.560 --> 02:42.891
Not exactly.

02:44.880 --> 02:47.565
Look, I know it's been a little
rough around here lately.

02:47.640 --> 02:49.290
Yeah, a little.

02:53.520 --> 02:54.567
What?

02:59.120 --> 03:01.771
So, what happens when Adalind
finds out you're a Grimm again?

03:03.280 --> 03:05.760
Well, one less Hexenbiest wouldn't
be a bad thing, would it?

03:07.080 --> 03:08.650
No, I guess not.

03:30.600 --> 03:31.681
I smell smoke.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.491
Oh, my God!

03:45.480 --> 03:47.005
Oh, God, Mason!

03:49.880 --> 03:51.484
I can't breathe!

03:52.120 --> 03:53.360
Joan!

03:54.200 --> 03:56.202
Come on,
we gotta get out of here!

04:24.480 --> 04:26.482
Hey. We got an ID on the bodies?

04:26.560 --> 04:28.847
Mason Heady
and Joan Tapford.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.446
Employees. Supposed to be closing
up, according to the owner,

04:31.520 --> 04:35.047
who is right over there, John
Harrison, and his son Andy.

04:35.120 --> 04:36.804
The guy with the clipboard is
the insurance investigator.

04:36.920 --> 04:38.490
Arson's inside.

04:41.680 --> 04:43.523
They must've got
trapped in here.

04:43.600 --> 04:47.047
Tried to get out by breaking the
window, which caused a backdraft.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.282
They didn't survive very long
after that window broke.

04:49.360 --> 04:50.486
Did they start the fire?

04:50.600 --> 04:52.409
Too early to tell.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.562
Where'd it start?
Breaker box.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.120
Could have been electrical.

04:59.200 --> 05:02.010
There's no sign of accelerants or
any kind of incendiary device.

05:02.080 --> 05:04.606
But see that vent
up there?

05:04.680 --> 05:06.682
Fires are fairly
predictable.

05:06.760 --> 05:09.604
Once it got going, it should have
followed the ventilation system.

05:09.680 --> 05:11.011
"Should have"
means it didn't?

05:13.080 --> 05:15.560
Let me show you
how the fire moved.

05:16.120 --> 05:19.841
Fire turns right here,
moves down this aisle,

05:19.920 --> 05:22.161
then comes all
the way around here,

05:22.240 --> 05:25.528
then goes down this aisle
and down the stairs.

05:26.520 --> 05:28.443
Fires just don't
turn for no reason.

05:28.520 --> 05:30.807
So, this fire had
a mind of its own?

05:30.920 --> 05:31.921
For the most part.

05:32.760 --> 05:35.730
In the office is the only
place the fire makes sense.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.086
When they broke
the window,

05:37.160 --> 05:39.561
the fire went right for the
oxygen like it's supposed to.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.688
Well, let's talk
to the owner.

05:41.760 --> 05:42.886
Thank you.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.405
This is just
unbelievable.

05:44.480 --> 05:47.051
This property's been
in my family for 60 years.

05:47.120 --> 05:48.610
Nothing like this
has ever happened before.

05:48.680 --> 05:49.840
How'd you hear
about the fire?

05:49.880 --> 05:52.850
The fire department called
me about 10:30 last night.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.445
Where were you
when you got the call?

05:54.520 --> 05:57.842
At Mulligan's. The restaurant.
With Andy.

05:57.960 --> 06:00.201
We were celebrating
his promotion to manager.

06:00.280 --> 06:01.611
And what time did you
get to Mulligan's?

06:01.680 --> 06:03.887
You... You think I had
something to do with this?

06:04.880 --> 06:07.451
This business was started
by my grandfather.

06:07.520 --> 06:09.010
I worked here since I was a kid.
So did my son.

06:09.080 --> 06:10.969
Take it easy, Dad, just...
Just take it easy.

06:11.040 --> 06:12.041
We got there
about 8:00.

06:12.120 --> 06:14.168
As soon as we got the call,
we came over here.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.685
We've been here
all night.

06:15.760 --> 06:17.205
Why were Mason
and Joan inside?

06:17.280 --> 06:19.044
I don't know.

06:19.120 --> 06:22.647
They should've been out by 6:30.
7:00 at the latest.

06:22.720 --> 06:25.041
Those poor kids.

06:25.120 --> 06:26.770
What am I gonna tell
their families?

06:26.840 --> 06:29.081
We'll need your contact information,
a list of all your employees,

06:29.200 --> 06:30.804
anybody who had access
to the building.

06:30.880 --> 06:31.961
I can do that.

06:33.400 --> 06:34.640
We're sorry for your loss.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.082
How do you explain a fire
with a mind of its own?

06:46.160 --> 06:47.241
You can't.

06:47.320 --> 06:49.049
You think
they were involved?

06:49.120 --> 06:51.487
Well, they sure
had an alibi ready.

06:51.560 --> 06:55.610
Okay, let's assume Dad hired
someone to torch the business.

06:55.680 --> 06:56.920
Someone who knew
what he was doing,

06:57.000 --> 06:58.331
except he killed
two innocent people.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.323
Let's start with insurance,

07:00.440 --> 07:03.171
see if it was worth burning
down to begin with.

07:04.360 --> 07:06.522
When was the policy renewed?

07:08.680 --> 07:11.206
What's the cash value?
Uh-huh.

07:11.680 --> 07:13.728
And has Mr. Harrison filed
any previous claims?

07:14.800 --> 07:16.882
That's all we need for now.
Thank you.

07:18.320 --> 07:21.563
$5-million policy,
upgraded last year.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.404
Take a look at this.

07:24.280 --> 07:27.887
Harrison & Sons filed for Chapter
7 bankruptcy three months ago.

07:27.960 --> 07:28.961
I think we have
a motive.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.281
So, alibi checks out.

07:31.360 --> 07:32.930
They were at the restaurant
when they said they were.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.729
All right, check with
the arson guys downstairs,

07:34.800 --> 07:35.961
see if they have
any similar cases.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.451
Yup, on it.

07:37.560 --> 07:40.200
Let's talk with the lawyer who filed
the bankruptcy, Charles Laney.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.521
There's no way John would
burn down his own building.

07:44.600 --> 07:45.965
He inherited it
from his father

07:46.040 --> 07:47.963
who inherited it
from his father,

07:48.040 --> 07:49.371
and John's going
to give it to his son.

07:49.440 --> 07:50.601
What about the bankruptcy?

07:50.680 --> 07:53.160
It's true there
were some money issues,

07:53.240 --> 07:55.641
but bankruptcy filing is just
a reorganization of debt.

07:55.720 --> 07:58.087
Which means somebody he
owes money to is not happy.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.161
I'm sure there's a few.

07:59.240 --> 08:00.810
We're gonna need to get
a list of the debtors.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.848
I can put that together for you.
That all?

08:02.960 --> 08:04.041
Unfortunately, no.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.009
This is a homicide
investigation.

08:06.080 --> 08:07.411
There were two deaths.
What?

08:07.480 --> 08:10.211
Two employees were working late last night.
They got trapped inside.

08:10.280 --> 08:12.123
Oh, my God,
that's terrible.

08:12.240 --> 08:14.925
We're gonna need access to the
company's financial records.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.765
If you can't provide them,
we'll subpoena them.

08:21.600 --> 08:24.206
Kelly Burkhardt sold the
truck three months ago.

08:24.280 --> 08:27.682
The truck was re-registered
to a Dennis and Helen Becker

08:27.760 --> 08:29.649
in Spokane, Washington.

08:29.720 --> 08:31.210
Did the people
she sold the truck to

08:31.320 --> 08:32.845
say anything about
a child being with her?

08:32.919 --> 08:35.241
I haven't been able to find
out anything about your daughter.

08:35.320 --> 08:36.845
But that doesn't mean
Kelly doesn't have her.

08:36.919 --> 08:38.365
She would have had to buy
a new vehicle, then.

08:38.440 --> 08:39.520
Or steal one.

08:39.600 --> 08:42.171
I don't think she'd risk
that with the child.

08:42.240 --> 08:43.525
I'll get someone
to check the listings

08:43.600 --> 08:45.011
of all vehicles
sold within two days

08:45.080 --> 08:47.447
of her getting
rid of that truck.

08:47.520 --> 08:50.251
Stay close, I'll let you
know what I find out.

08:52.200 --> 08:53.611
Still doesn't make
any sense.

08:53.720 --> 08:56.724
Why would you file for bankruptcy,
then burn down your building?

08:56.800 --> 08:58.240
Aren't you asking
to be investigated?

08:58.280 --> 09:01.727
Well, either he's really
stupid or it was an accident.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.007
Let's find out more
about this lawyer.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.445
Hey, Wu.

09:05.520 --> 09:07.000
Can you run
a background check for us?

09:07.040 --> 09:08.246
Yeah. Who?

09:08.360 --> 09:10.567
Charles Laney, he handled
the Harrison bankruptcy.

09:10.640 --> 09:11.641
See what you can
find out.

09:11.720 --> 09:14.246
Will do. And I have something
kind of interesting.

09:14.320 --> 09:15.321
Hmm.

09:15.400 --> 09:17.084
Talked to
Lieutenant Bradey in Arson,

09:17.200 --> 09:18.884
says the weird fire
pattern sounds a lot like

09:18.960 --> 09:20.564
a case an old partner
of his was following.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.369
Same MO.
Was never able to crack it.

09:22.440 --> 09:25.649
Says his partner was a little
obsessed with nailing this firebug.

09:25.720 --> 09:28.007
You know, the one
that always got away.

09:28.080 --> 09:29.206
Let's talk to this cop.

09:29.280 --> 09:30.611
If he'll talk to you.

09:30.680 --> 09:31.727
Why wouldn't he?

09:31.840 --> 09:35.208
You arrested him
for murder.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.322
Hey, Orson,
let's go, you got visitors.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.640
Oh, yeah,
who is it?

09:45.720 --> 09:48.849
Detectives from Portland.
Griffin and Burkhardt.

09:51.440 --> 09:52.851
Hell, no!

09:56.960 --> 09:58.291
I didn't really know
what was going on back then.

09:58.360 --> 10:00.169
You know? It was just
all starting to happen.

10:00.320 --> 10:02.561
An investigator tells
the story he wants told.

10:02.640 --> 10:04.130
I tell the truth.
Yeah?

10:04.200 --> 10:05.565
And how about
your two brothers?

10:05.640 --> 10:07.160
You wanna tell me
the truth about them?

10:10.560 --> 10:13.211
You arrested him. You didn't convict him.
He did the killings.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.284
Yeah, but I didn't know
Bauerschwein

10:16.360 --> 10:18.567
and Blutbaden had
this ancient feud.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.205
Doesn't justify
what he did.

10:20.280 --> 10:22.442
I mean, Angelina
did kill his brothers.

10:22.520 --> 10:23.567
Angelina?

10:23.720 --> 10:24.767
Yeah.
Monroe's ex-girlfriend.

10:24.840 --> 10:27.161
That Angelina?
She killed Orson's brothers?

10:27.240 --> 10:29.004
That was one of my first
cases as a Grimm.

10:29.080 --> 10:30.206
What the hell was I
supposed to know?

10:30.280 --> 10:31.520
Well, more than I did.

10:31.600 --> 10:36.003
Well, well, well, well.
It's been a long time.

10:36.080 --> 10:37.570
You boys look swell.

10:38.600 --> 10:41.206
I wouldn't be here
unless I had to.

10:41.280 --> 10:42.327
That hurts.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.084
We got a fire we can't
figure out.

10:44.160 --> 10:46.811
I'm not on
the payroll anymore.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.406
I'm wearing a different uniform.
Maybe you didn't notice.

10:49.480 --> 10:50.641
Yeah, this fire is different.

10:50.720 --> 10:51.960
You want me
to do your job?

10:52.040 --> 10:54.486
Look, you told me once, "Whatever
else we are, we're both cops."

10:54.560 --> 10:56.847
Now, this is a chance
for you to be a cop again.

10:56.920 --> 11:00.811
Mason Heady and Joan Tapford
were both caught inside.

11:00.880 --> 11:02.006
This fire had
no accelerant.

11:02.080 --> 11:03.840
It didn't move the way
fires are supposed to.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.450
Almost like it had
a mind of its own.

11:05.560 --> 11:07.927
An old partner of yours,
Lieutenant Bradey,

11:08.000 --> 11:09.809
suggested you might know
who we're after.

11:09.880 --> 11:12.850
Yeah, he said you got real close
to figuring out who he was.

11:14.600 --> 11:17.922
You have no idea how many years
I spent tracking this guy.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.530
I saw him once.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.011
I came so close.

11:23.080 --> 11:25.731
I would've caught him.
It was only a matter of time.

11:25.800 --> 11:28.167
But then you arrested me.

11:28.240 --> 11:29.526
You're telling us
you can ID him?

11:29.600 --> 11:32.126
I... I never did put
a face to the name.

11:32.200 --> 11:34.680
But if I saw him again,
yeah.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.649
Would you have
a photograph to show me?

11:36.720 --> 11:37.721
No.

11:37.840 --> 11:39.888
Then I don't know
how I can help you.

11:43.280 --> 11:46.363
If he saw this guy's face,
Orson might be our best shot.

11:47.320 --> 11:49.448
Yeah, but not from
in here.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.409
It's good to be back.

12:04.080 --> 12:07.448
Hey, Captain,
it's been a long time.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.966
Three years,
27 days, to be exact.

12:13.760 --> 12:14.807
Sit.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.169
Now, you're here
for one reason only,

12:21.240 --> 12:23.242
to assist
these detectives.

12:23.320 --> 12:24.765
You got two days.

12:24.840 --> 12:27.241
You make one false move,
you'll be right back inside,

12:27.320 --> 12:29.926
and I guarantee you, no parole
board will ever let you out.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.764
So much
for the warm welcome.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.321
Tell us what you know.

12:34.440 --> 12:36.442
Well, I...

12:36.520 --> 12:38.090
I'm gonna need more time.
You don't have it.

12:38.160 --> 12:41.130
This... This guy,
he moves around a lot.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.646
I mean, he's...
He's not what you'd expect.

12:43.720 --> 12:45.529
It's kinda hard to explain.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.011
Is he Wesen?

12:51.920 --> 12:53.001
Wesen what?

12:54.040 --> 12:55.451
You're Bauerschwein.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.563
Nick's a Grimm.

12:58.680 --> 12:59.681
Yeah, we know.

13:02.480 --> 13:03.561
Wow.

13:04.720 --> 13:06.927
I've been away too long.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.968
- Does everybody in the precinct...
- No. No.

13:09.040 --> 13:10.041
And we're gonna
keep it that way.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.770
Where'd you see
the suspect?

13:11.840 --> 13:14.127
Oh, at another fire. I recognized
him from a previous arson.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.487
By the way, he's...
He's one of those guys

13:16.560 --> 13:18.961
that likes to light 'em
and stick around to watch.

13:19.040 --> 13:21.884
I... I chased him into the basement
of the building next door.

13:21.960 --> 13:22.961
I figured I had him.

13:23.040 --> 13:26.487
And then I found his clothes.
He'd taken them off.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.449
Then I saw him Woge.
Into what?

13:29.440 --> 13:31.761
I don't know. I mean,
he was literally on fire.

13:31.840 --> 13:34.366
I made a lot of notes. They'd
be in my old case files.

13:34.440 --> 13:37.091
They're open cases.
They'll be downstairs.

13:37.160 --> 13:39.083
You guys work
the files.

13:39.160 --> 13:40.764
I'm gonna go do a little reading.
Is he kidding?

13:40.880 --> 13:42.962
No. Let's go.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.164
Uh, this could be
what we're looking for.

13:50.240 --> 13:51.890
What do you got?

13:52.800 --> 13:54.086
An Excandesco.

13:55.880 --> 13:57.006
It's Latin.

13:57.080 --> 14:01.722
I think it translates to "burns with
rage," or "raging, burning thing."

14:01.800 --> 14:03.484
You know, a flaming person.

14:03.560 --> 14:04.561
You speak Latin?

14:04.640 --> 14:05.721
Not really,

14:05.800 --> 14:08.451
but I've picked up a little bit
ever since I got all this.

14:09.480 --> 14:12.324
Hopefully, there's an English
translation.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.685
Here we go.

14:14.760 --> 14:18.401
"Rome, July 18th, AD 64."

14:18.480 --> 14:20.289
Whoa, seriously?

14:20.360 --> 14:21.361
Well, I mean,
it's a translation

14:21.440 --> 14:24.091
of a translation
of a translation,

14:24.160 --> 14:25.844
but, well,
the date stays the same.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.809
"At the request
of Peter and Paul,

14:29.080 --> 14:31.208
"fearful for their
Christian brothers,

14:31.280 --> 14:34.124
"I'd spent weeks
following the Excandesco

14:34.240 --> 14:37.369
"thought to be
the basis for the Phoenix.

14:38.960 --> 14:41.566
"His patron was
the Emperor Nero himself,

14:41.640 --> 14:42.971
"and Peter knew
he was being sent

14:43.080 --> 14:44.969
"to destroy
Christians in the city.

14:45.040 --> 14:48.681
"That night was a windy one as I
followed him through the streets.

14:48.760 --> 14:51.240
"He entered one of
the small stores.

14:51.320 --> 14:54.210
"I tried to catch up to him, but
the madness had already begun.

14:54.280 --> 14:58.251
"The flames spread rapidly through
the narrow, twisting streets,

14:58.320 --> 15:02.644
"rising and spreading to the
Palatine and Caelian slopes.

15:02.720 --> 15:06.566
"With nothing to stop it,
the fire raged through Rome.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.768
"I blame myself for not
being able to stop him,

15:08.840 --> 15:13.084
"for as I closed in to kill
him, he emitted terrible heat.

15:13.200 --> 15:15.601
"I could not continue
and had to fall back,

15:15.720 --> 15:18.041
"my skin and scalp
badly burned.

15:18.120 --> 15:22.444
"There is nothing I know
that can stop these devils."

15:22.520 --> 15:24.841
Now, when he says "devils,"
is he referring to...

15:24.920 --> 15:26.490
No, I doubt it.

15:42.280 --> 15:43.327
What's the problem?

15:44.200 --> 15:47.010
A couple of homicide detectives
came to see me today.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.526
There were two kids
inside the Harrison building.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.482
He told me
it would be empty.

15:52.560 --> 15:56.326
You were told wrong, and now
we've got a double homicide.

15:57.360 --> 15:58.725
This is not my fault.

15:58.800 --> 16:01.121
I don't think
the cops are gonna care.

16:01.200 --> 16:03.521
You have to clean house, starting
with anyone who can ID you,

16:03.600 --> 16:05.409
including your last client.

16:05.480 --> 16:07.244
He'll be sweating
this as much as us,

16:07.360 --> 16:08.771
but he won't be able
to handle it.

16:10.040 --> 16:14.011
And next time, check the damn
building before you light it up.

16:14.080 --> 16:16.048
A little diligence
never hurt anybody.

16:16.160 --> 16:17.605
You're wrong.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.324
This is gonna hurt.

16:44.760 --> 16:46.410
Every arsonist
has a signature.

16:46.480 --> 16:48.528
Gasoline, kerosene,
diesel, schnapps...

16:48.600 --> 16:49.840
There was a guy
who used schnapps.

16:49.920 --> 16:51.843
What he didn't drink, he
would use to start the fire.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.809
But this guy, he has
no point of ignition.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.689
He didn't leave
a trace of anything.

16:57.880 --> 16:59.325
Have you ever heard
of an Excandesco?

16:59.400 --> 17:01.368
No, what is that?

17:03.360 --> 17:04.599
My God.

17:04.680 --> 17:07.490
That's what he looked like
when he was Woged.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.685
Where'd you get that?

17:09.400 --> 17:11.209
A, uh,
not-so-public library.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.770
You think
he's the accelerant himself?

17:12.839 --> 17:14.444
Could be.

17:14.520 --> 17:18.366
And what if he's producing it,
like, in his skin or glands?

17:18.440 --> 17:19.441
Phosphorus.

17:19.520 --> 17:20.885
Phosphorus? Really?

17:20.960 --> 17:23.611
White phosphorus makes up 1%
of the human body.

17:23.680 --> 17:24.806
It's in every cell.

17:24.880 --> 17:27.645
And it only needs 86 degrees
before it ignites,

17:27.720 --> 17:31.725
and burns like hell once it's
exposed to oxygen, like...

17:31.840 --> 17:33.922
Like a match. You're
talking a human match?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.047
Yeah, basically.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.646
Just when you think the
world can't get any weirder.

17:37.720 --> 17:40.166
This guy's producing
more than 1%.

17:40.240 --> 17:42.971
Oh, yeah. Way more.
Way, way more.

17:43.080 --> 17:45.208
When I got close to him,
I almost fried.

17:45.280 --> 17:46.725
All right, then how
do we arrest him?

17:46.800 --> 17:49.371
We can't stop him
from producing phosphorus,

17:49.440 --> 17:51.044
so we need to stop him
from igniting.

17:51.160 --> 17:54.243
Well, phosphorus needs oxygen to burn.
We've got to block that.

17:54.320 --> 17:56.527
We're gonna need some pretty
heavy-duty sunscreen to do that.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.568
Yeah, like 10,000 SPF?

17:58.680 --> 18:00.091
I can make it.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.764
I can make it if I get
the right stuff,

18:01.840 --> 18:03.604
but I'm gonna need
some special ingredients.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.683
Spice Shop might
have just what he needs.

18:07.680 --> 18:08.920
Um...

18:10.160 --> 18:12.401
I should probably
call first.

18:15.840 --> 18:16.921
Spice Shop.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.525
Rosalee.
Nick.

18:18.600 --> 18:19.931
Yeah, is, uh, Monroe there?

18:20.000 --> 18:21.411
No, he left
for a repair job.

18:21.480 --> 18:22.527
Is he not picking up
his cell?

18:22.600 --> 18:23.601
When will he be back?

18:23.720 --> 18:24.721
At least a couple of hours.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.007
He had to pick up the parts, and
the repair's in Lake Oswego.

18:27.080 --> 18:28.969
All right, actually, you're
the one I wanted to talk to.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.963
Okay, well,
I'm here all day.

18:31.040 --> 18:32.451
Coming over.

18:34.240 --> 18:36.083
We need to get
to Juliette.

18:36.160 --> 18:37.161
Not just yet.

18:37.240 --> 18:38.810
Then what are we doing?

18:38.880 --> 18:40.370
It's called
back-channel diplomacy.

18:40.440 --> 18:43.603
And it cannot be done truly
effectively when done so loudly.

18:43.680 --> 18:44.761
He's here.

18:44.840 --> 18:46.046
Mmm.

18:46.680 --> 18:47.761
Who?

18:47.840 --> 18:50.320
Just watch and,
hopefully, learn.

18:52.480 --> 18:55.165
So, what did Renard
tell you?

18:55.240 --> 19:00.690
Kelly Burkhardt was last known to be
driving a 2008 Ford F250 Crew Cab,

19:00.760 --> 19:05.766
Oregon DOV 412, registered
to Juliette Silverton.

19:06.520 --> 19:10.206
So, Miss Silverton
did have a role to play.

19:10.280 --> 19:12.169
Three months ago,
the truck was re-registered

19:12.240 --> 19:15.164
to a Dennis and Helen Becker
in Spokane, Washington.

19:15.240 --> 19:16.526
So, she sold the truck.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.284
Do you think
you can find her?

19:18.560 --> 19:19.891
Oh, I'll find her.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.444
I look forward
to hearing from you.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.770
That's diplomacy.

19:27.320 --> 19:29.607
So, let me try a little bit
of it on Juliette.

19:34.920 --> 19:36.365
Rosalee?

19:38.280 --> 19:39.691
Nick. Hank.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.569
Rosalee,
his is Peter Orson.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.246
He used to be
an arson investigator.

19:45.320 --> 19:46.367
Used to be?

19:46.440 --> 19:48.522
All right, this doesn't
really need to be awkward.

19:48.600 --> 19:51.331
I am in jail, but they got
me out to help on a case.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.926
No, not awkward at all.
What can I do for you?

19:54.000 --> 19:55.684
Well, we need
an ointment thick enough

19:55.760 --> 19:57.285
to handle some
very intense heat.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.523
How much heat?
Blowtorch heat.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.045
Wow, okay.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.770
You ever heard
of an Excandesco?

20:03.840 --> 20:06.081
No, so this is Wesen related.
Yeah.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.726
So, they sent
the wrong parts, of course.

20:08.800 --> 20:11.167
So, now it's gonna be
like two weeks since...

20:13.240 --> 20:14.765
You.
You.

20:15.480 --> 20:16.527
Hey! Hey!

20:16.800 --> 20:18.723
Monroe!

20:18.800 --> 20:20.689
Monroe, take it easy,
he's with us.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.243
Back off.

20:26.880 --> 20:28.120
What the hell
is he doing here?

20:28.800 --> 20:31.041
Why isn't he in jail
where he belongs?

20:31.120 --> 20:32.724
If I belong there,
so do you!

20:32.840 --> 20:35.002
He's working with us on a case.
What?

20:35.080 --> 20:37.560
We've got two dead kids,
burned up in a fire.

20:37.640 --> 20:39.927
Orson was an investigator who
knows the guy we're after.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.206
You mean,
you got him out?

20:41.280 --> 20:43.089
Look, he can ID
the arsonist.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.367
I'm sorry I brought...
Dude! He killed Hap!

20:45.440 --> 20:47.408
Yeah, and your girlfriend
killed my brothers!

20:47.480 --> 20:49.130
If I'm in jail,
why isn't she?

20:49.200 --> 20:50.486
Because she's dead.

20:51.560 --> 20:52.846
Oh.

20:53.520 --> 20:57.650
Well, that's the first piece of good
news I got since I went to prison.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.609
Look, I don't care
what kind of help you need,

20:59.680 --> 21:02.604
you are not getting
it here, not this time.

21:02.680 --> 21:04.728
You Blutbaden, you never
give up on it, do you?

21:04.800 --> 21:07.320
No. Not when it comes to Bauerschwein
with blood on their hands.

21:07.360 --> 21:08.361
Guys...

21:08.440 --> 21:09.487
- As if the Blutbaden...
- Guys!

21:09.560 --> 21:11.801
...doesn't have any blood on their hands?
Your kind started this!

21:11.880 --> 21:13.882
That's right.
And my kind can finish it!

21:14.000 --> 21:15.331
All right, enough!

21:19.120 --> 21:20.884
We're going.
Good!

21:21.720 --> 21:22.801
Nick!

21:23.920 --> 21:24.967
Don't go.

21:29.800 --> 21:33.247
I cannot believe Nick brought
that Bauerschwein here.

21:33.320 --> 21:35.846
He's trying to find out who
killed two kids in a fire.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.604
That's why Nick got him
out of prison.

21:37.680 --> 21:41.082
He's not worried about some
Blutbad-Bauerschwein feud.

21:41.160 --> 21:42.161
He came here for help.

21:42.240 --> 21:45.130
No! Rosalee, that guy stuck
a shotgun in my face.

21:45.240 --> 21:46.287
In my house!

21:47.560 --> 21:50.882
I am so sick of this,
this hatred among Wesen.

21:51.880 --> 21:54.884
Didn't I almost lose you to that
kind of Old World stupidity?

21:55.000 --> 21:57.002
Oh, my God,
that was totally different.

21:57.080 --> 21:58.491
It's not different.

21:58.560 --> 22:00.369
Nick is trying to do
what's right.

22:00.440 --> 22:04.001
And if you can't handle it, then maybe
you should be the one to leave.

22:04.080 --> 22:05.844
Are you serious?

22:05.920 --> 22:09.367
It's not about you, Monroe. It's not
about me, and it's not about Orson.

22:09.440 --> 22:12.649
It's about two dead kids. And
I think we should help them.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.248
Fine. You help them.

22:28.760 --> 22:30.205
Monroe left.

22:31.960 --> 22:33.485
Rosalee, I'm sorry.

22:33.560 --> 22:34.891
This feud goes
way too far back

22:34.960 --> 22:36.530
for you to take
any responsibility.

22:36.600 --> 22:37.886
Well, I know,
but I shouldn't have...

22:38.040 --> 22:39.246
No. You need help, Nick.

22:39.320 --> 22:42.130
You should be
able to get help.

22:42.200 --> 22:43.247
Feud or no feud.

22:45.800 --> 22:46.801
Let's get started.

22:52.720 --> 22:56.202
It's like an oil fire. We can't use water.
It won't stop it.

22:56.280 --> 22:58.089
If he can produce
phosphorus from his skin,

22:58.160 --> 22:59.286
you'll have to
suppress it topically.

22:59.360 --> 23:01.408
Something that can
be applied to his skin

23:01.480 --> 23:02.760
that won't evaporate
in the heat.

23:02.800 --> 23:04.484
And we have to figure out
a way to get it onto him.

23:04.560 --> 23:06.369
Gotta be some kind
of fire extinguisher.

23:06.440 --> 23:08.886
Yeah, good. And it's gotta be sticky
enough that he can't wipe it off.

23:08.960 --> 23:10.405
And it can't be flammable.

23:10.480 --> 23:11.845
Like a skin conditioner
that won't burn.

23:11.920 --> 23:12.921
Yes.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.206
Let's start
with licorice root.

23:14.280 --> 23:16.567
We boil it down, it gets
very sticky when heated.

23:16.640 --> 23:18.369
It's the third shelf,
at the top.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.090
What else?

23:20.160 --> 23:23.403
Beeswax, it retains moisture
when it's applied.

23:23.480 --> 23:26.563
Middle shelf, all the way to the left...
No, to the right.

23:26.640 --> 23:30.531
And witch hazel, left side, all the
way at the bottom, second shelf down.

23:30.600 --> 23:31.965
Oh, and, uh, Hank, jojoba.

23:32.040 --> 23:33.280
Around the corner
and then at the bottom.

23:33.360 --> 23:34.521
I got it.

23:39.240 --> 23:41.766
Okay. Good.
Here's what we have to do.

23:41.840 --> 23:43.251
We've got to crush up
the licorice root,

23:43.320 --> 23:44.685
and then mix
everything together

23:44.800 --> 23:47.690
and then heat it up
till it liquefies.

23:51.440 --> 23:52.851
I'll get the bowls.

23:58.680 --> 23:59.727
How many?

24:00.400 --> 24:01.447
Two should do it.

24:05.880 --> 24:06.881
Wu.

24:08.680 --> 24:10.125
What? Where?

24:12.080 --> 24:15.368
The attorney, Charles Laney, was
found burned to death in his car.

24:16.800 --> 24:18.040
We'll meet you there.

24:19.040 --> 24:22.601
We gotta go check this out.
Orson, you're coming with us.

24:22.680 --> 24:25.001
Can you...
Yeah, we got the gist.

24:29.920 --> 24:31.524
You okay?

24:32.480 --> 24:35.165
No. I feel like
a total idiot.

24:37.120 --> 24:39.327
You were so right.

24:39.400 --> 24:41.402
It's about two dead kids.

24:42.680 --> 24:44.125
You're not an idiot.

24:45.440 --> 24:46.930
What if I hadn't come back?

24:47.560 --> 24:50.723
Then you might've been
a little bit of an idiot.

24:52.960 --> 24:54.564
Let's just get to work.

24:57.760 --> 25:01.401
Andy.

25:03.120 --> 25:04.610
You're gonna have to get
ready soon.

25:05.640 --> 25:07.529
Yeah, I'm not sure
I want to go.

25:07.600 --> 25:11.810
It's not about what you want,
it's about your responsibilities,

25:11.880 --> 25:14.963
paying respect to the
people that work for you.

25:15.040 --> 25:18.010
When you take over Harrison
& Sons, you'll understand.

25:18.680 --> 25:21.331
Dad, Harrison & Sons
is gone.

25:21.400 --> 25:23.448
I'm not going
to let the company

25:23.520 --> 25:25.807
my grandfather built
go under.

25:25.960 --> 25:27.007
And neither are you.

25:27.120 --> 25:28.360
We're gonna rebuild.

25:28.440 --> 25:30.283
There is no company anymore.

25:30.360 --> 25:32.601
All right? The Internet
is wiping us out.

25:32.680 --> 25:35.081
We offer a service you
can't get on the Internet.

25:36.040 --> 25:39.647
People don't care about service.
They just want stuff.

25:39.720 --> 25:40.881
Can't you just
let it go?

25:40.960 --> 25:42.769
Once the insurance
money comes through...

25:42.880 --> 25:44.803
God, I can't talk
to you about this.

25:44.880 --> 25:46.962
Look, the fire
was a real shock,

25:47.040 --> 25:48.849
but we've had
setbacks before.

25:48.920 --> 25:51.002
I've worked my entire life
to make sure

25:51.080 --> 25:52.445
that I had something
to leave you.

25:52.520 --> 25:55.569
God, can you just
listen to me for once?

25:55.640 --> 25:58.849
I have tried so many
times to tell you.

25:58.920 --> 26:02.641
Haven't you ever asked yourself
whether I wanted this legacy?

26:03.440 --> 26:06.171
Andy...
I can't do this anymore.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.762
- Hello?
- Where are you?

26:22.840 --> 26:23.921
Why are you calling me?

26:24.000 --> 26:27.243
I'm calling
because you screwed up.

26:27.320 --> 26:29.243
You said there would be
nobody inside.

26:29.320 --> 26:31.163
No, you screwed up!

26:31.240 --> 26:33.083
We need to talk about how
you're going to fix this.

26:33.160 --> 26:34.764
Me?

26:34.840 --> 26:35.887
You killed them!

26:35.960 --> 26:37.769
You hired me.

26:37.840 --> 26:39.842
We need to talk now.

26:40.920 --> 26:42.524
No, we don't.

26:49.360 --> 26:51.408
We sure he's the one?

26:51.480 --> 26:53.289
Car registration matches.

26:53.360 --> 26:55.124
Got the background
on him you asked for.

26:55.200 --> 26:57.885
Laney went into private
practice years ago.

26:57.960 --> 26:59.400
Before that
he was a public defender.

26:59.440 --> 27:02.364
Didn't think anything of it until I
got a hit on one of his clients,

27:02.440 --> 27:04.807
who was a suspect
in an arson fire.

27:04.880 --> 27:07.690
Name is Damien Barso, 18-year-old
high-school student,

27:07.760 --> 27:09.967
charged with burning down
his school gym.

27:10.040 --> 27:11.565
Laney got him off
'cause they were never able

27:11.640 --> 27:13.051
to prove
how the fire was set.

27:13.720 --> 27:15.165
Kid disappeared
right after that.

27:15.240 --> 27:17.811
This is a police file
photo on him at the time.

27:17.880 --> 27:19.086
Yeah, that's him.

27:19.160 --> 27:20.924
He's older now,
obviously, but that's him.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.446
That's... That's the guy
from the other fire.

27:23.520 --> 27:26.967
So, Laney put Harrison
in touch with Barso,

27:27.080 --> 27:28.366
who hired him
to burn down his building

27:28.440 --> 27:29.680
and collect
the insurance money.

27:29.720 --> 27:31.324
Only problem is,
two people died.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.561
Now three.

27:33.560 --> 27:34.607
Going somewhere?

27:35.160 --> 27:36.889
- I saw him!
- Really?

27:36.960 --> 27:38.166
Yeah, I'm not trying
to get away.

27:38.240 --> 27:39.605
I saw him.
I saw Barso up there.

27:39.720 --> 27:40.767
I swear to...

27:41.240 --> 27:42.480
Are you sure
it was Barso?

27:44.040 --> 27:46.691
I don't know.
I... I don't know.

27:46.760 --> 27:48.125
Maybe I'm just seeing
what I want to see

27:48.200 --> 27:49.770
because I've been
inside too long.

27:49.840 --> 27:52.525
If Barso was here,
he's gone now.

27:52.600 --> 27:55.444
He's eliminating
every connection to him.

27:55.920 --> 27:59.003
Which would mean Harrison
is next on the list.

28:09.880 --> 28:10.881
Andy?

28:11.000 --> 28:14.129
No, this is Lieutenant
Johnson, I'm with Portland Arson.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.645
Can I call you back?
I'm supposed to...

28:15.720 --> 28:18.530
Sir, I have some important
information on your building fire.

28:18.600 --> 28:19.886
We now believe it's arson.

28:19.960 --> 28:21.041
Oh, my God.

28:21.120 --> 28:22.200
We think we know
who did it.

28:22.240 --> 28:23.571
I'm sorry to have
to break it to you,

28:23.680 --> 28:25.967
but we think your lawyer,
Charles Laney, was involved.

28:26.040 --> 28:27.041
What?

28:27.120 --> 28:28.451
Sir, if you can meet me
at your building,

28:28.560 --> 28:30.642
I can show you
how the fire was set

28:30.720 --> 28:33.564
and the documentation linking Mr.
Laney to the arsonist.

28:34.640 --> 28:36.961
Of course,
I'll be right there.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.081
Dad.

29:07.160 --> 29:08.286
Dad?

29:14.840 --> 29:16.251
Andy?

29:16.320 --> 29:17.401
Dad, where are you?

29:17.480 --> 29:18.686
I'm at the store.

29:19.520 --> 29:21.602
I gotta tell you something.

29:21.680 --> 29:23.364
What's the matter?

29:23.520 --> 29:24.681
Um...

29:27.040 --> 29:28.405
it got all screwed up.

29:28.480 --> 29:29.481
What?

29:29.560 --> 29:30.686
It's hard to explain,

29:31.840 --> 29:33.922
but I messed up, Dad.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.725
And I am sorry.
I am so sorry.

29:36.800 --> 29:38.165
I never meant for anybody
to get hurt.

29:38.240 --> 29:39.446
What are you talking about?

29:39.520 --> 29:41.966
I'm the reason
that they died.

29:42.040 --> 29:43.565
I should've told them
to go home.

29:43.640 --> 29:46.007
Andy, I'm meeting
with Lieutenant Johnson,

29:46.080 --> 29:48.082
one of the police
arson investigators.

29:48.160 --> 29:50.925
They know who did it.
It was Charles Laney.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.970
No, listen,
I'm coming down there.

29:54.040 --> 29:56.247
I'm gonna tell you
everything.

30:06.520 --> 30:07.681
Hello?

30:09.440 --> 30:11.249
Lieutenant Johnson?

30:16.560 --> 30:18.085
Mr. Harrison?

30:18.920 --> 30:19.921
Yes.

30:24.440 --> 30:25.646
I'm Lieutenant Johnson.

30:25.880 --> 30:27.086
Oh.

30:27.440 --> 30:28.601
Right.

30:28.720 --> 30:31.530
I just spoke to my son.
He's going to meet us here.

30:31.640 --> 30:32.926
I hope that's all right.

30:33.040 --> 30:34.246
That's fine.

30:35.320 --> 30:37.209
Please, follow me.

30:41.080 --> 30:42.920
At first, we thought
it was an electrical fire,

30:42.960 --> 30:44.724
but it's more
complicated than that.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.165
What do you mean?

30:46.280 --> 30:48.521
It was made to look
like a short started it.

30:48.600 --> 30:50.090
Then what did?

30:50.840 --> 30:51.921
This.

30:56.240 --> 31:00.768
You're probably asking yourself,
"Now, how does he do that?"

31:16.800 --> 31:17.847
Hey!

31:18.800 --> 31:19.801
Where's your dad?

31:20.320 --> 31:21.401
Why?

31:21.480 --> 31:23.209
Because the man he hired
to burn down your building

31:23.280 --> 31:24.406
is gonna kill him.

31:24.480 --> 31:25.481
No, you're wrong.

31:25.560 --> 31:26.607
We don't have time to argue.
Where is he?

31:26.680 --> 31:29.365
He's at the building. I... I was
just on my way to meet him.

31:29.440 --> 31:31.841
He's with one of your
arson investigators. Who?

31:31.920 --> 31:33.570
Said his name
was Lieutenant Johnson.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.650
We don't have a Lieutenant
Johnson in Arson.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.006
It's gotta be Barso.

31:38.080 --> 31:39.081
And he's got his dad.

31:39.160 --> 31:40.685
And I'm telling you, guys,
he's gonna kill him.

31:40.760 --> 31:42.364
On, my God.

31:42.440 --> 31:44.761
Look, Barso's not after
my dad. He wants me.

31:44.880 --> 31:46.644
Look, my dad
didn't hire anybody.

31:46.720 --> 31:50.167
Our lawyer
introduced me to Barso.

31:50.240 --> 31:51.401
Nobody was supposed
to get hurt.

31:51.480 --> 31:52.561
You hired Barso?

31:52.680 --> 31:53.727
Yes.

31:53.800 --> 31:56.280
Well, that didn't turn out so good.
He just killed your lawyer.

31:58.080 --> 31:59.445
Get him out of here.

31:59.560 --> 32:00.766
Get him in the car.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.001
Rosalee.

32:03.080 --> 32:04.081
We got what you need.

32:04.160 --> 32:05.730
And we think we figured
out how to apply it.

32:05.800 --> 32:06.767
You wanna come by
and get it?

32:06.840 --> 32:07.966
No, we need you
to bring it.

32:08.040 --> 32:09.280
Where?

32:10.240 --> 32:13.005
You don't know your son
hated this store?

32:14.360 --> 32:17.011
He didn't wanna spend the rest
of his life in this place.

32:17.560 --> 32:21.121
See, that's the problem
with you parents.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.282
You're always pushing
your dreams onto your kids.

32:23.360 --> 32:25.283
My son didn't hire you.

32:26.240 --> 32:28.322
Then why would I be here?

32:28.400 --> 32:30.289
I don't burn up
buildings for fun.

32:30.360 --> 32:33.443
This is a business,
just like yours.

32:36.280 --> 32:37.611
Are you sure
you're okay to be here?

32:37.680 --> 32:38.727
Yeah, I'm okay.

32:42.880 --> 32:43.881
Hey.

32:43.960 --> 32:45.000
You got the stuff
mixed up?

32:45.040 --> 32:46.080
Yeah, it's ready.

32:46.120 --> 32:47.485
You know, we can't
use it till he Woges.

32:47.560 --> 32:48.800
Well, how are we gonna
get it onto him?

32:48.880 --> 32:50.689
It's not very high-tech,
but we think it'll work.

32:50.760 --> 32:51.886
Water guns?
Are you serious?

32:51.960 --> 32:53.564
They shoot
a long way.

32:53.640 --> 32:55.563
Plus, he won't be
expecting it. Uh, we hope.

32:55.640 --> 32:56.880
Not a lot of options.

32:57.720 --> 32:58.960
But we need to get your dad
out of there first.

32:59.080 --> 33:00.411
You're going to use
toys against this guy?

33:00.480 --> 33:02.403
He's a killer.
Are you crazy?

33:02.480 --> 33:03.561
I'm gonna go get my dad!

33:03.640 --> 33:06.325
Hey, hey, hey.
You're not going anywhere.

33:06.400 --> 33:08.004
I'll read you
your rights later.

33:08.080 --> 33:09.366
All right.

33:09.440 --> 33:13.411
We're gonna have to distract Barso
so we can get Harrison out.

33:13.480 --> 33:15.482
Give me your badge.
Why?

33:15.560 --> 33:17.085
Just give me your badge.
He knows me.

33:17.160 --> 33:18.810
I'm gonna be the last person
he expects to see in there.

33:18.880 --> 33:22.327
Give me the badge. I'll
take the heat, so to speak.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.164
Just don't take too long.

33:29.480 --> 33:32.211
Andy should be here
any minute.

33:32.320 --> 33:33.367
I wonder if he'll tell you
the truth.

33:33.440 --> 33:35.329
You're insane.

33:35.400 --> 33:37.448
You just think that
'cause you don't know me.

33:40.600 --> 33:42.728
Been a long time,
Barso.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.411
Remember me?

33:47.920 --> 33:51.686
Almost caught you when you burned
down the Comstock building.

33:54.240 --> 33:57.847
Burning down buildings,
that's one thing.

33:57.920 --> 34:01.129
Killing people,
that's just plain sloppy.

34:08.920 --> 34:13.562
You know, I used to think that
you were good at what you did.

34:14.440 --> 34:16.568
I'm really not concerned
with what you think.

34:20.480 --> 34:23.882
You should be, because
I know what you are.

34:24.840 --> 34:27.161
You don't know
what you're talking about.

34:35.480 --> 34:37.562
I guess being
an Excandesco means

34:37.639 --> 34:39.927
you don't have to worry
about being cold.

34:42.800 --> 34:43.847
Not really.

34:45.159 --> 34:47.400
You just stay where you are.
You're under arrest.

34:47.520 --> 34:51.889
You almost caught me once, but
remember what happened then?

34:54.159 --> 34:57.960
Come on over.
Arrest me, Bauerschwein.

35:14.200 --> 35:15.531
on.

35:17.800 --> 35:20.167
What's the matter?

35:20.240 --> 35:21.651
I'm not gonna
put up a fight.

35:22.200 --> 35:24.487
If you're waiting for Andy,
he's not coming.

35:25.880 --> 35:28.850
What'd that idiot do?
Confess?

35:35.160 --> 35:37.003
Orson, we got him!

35:51.200 --> 35:52.201
What the hell is this?

35:52.280 --> 35:53.327
It's over, Barso.

35:53.400 --> 35:56.085
I told you,
you're under arrest.

35:57.080 --> 35:58.366
I don't think so.

36:02.720 --> 36:04.006
It's happening!

36:05.200 --> 36:06.247
Now!

36:21.440 --> 36:22.441
What's happening?

36:25.680 --> 36:28.490
What did you do to me?
What did you do to me?

36:28.560 --> 36:30.403
I think we better move back.

36:33.760 --> 36:35.444
He's burning up
from the inside.

36:39.080 --> 36:40.366
I think
he's gonna blow!

36:57.960 --> 36:59.530
Is that what's supposed
to happen?

36:59.600 --> 37:03.127
Well, it's not an exact,
you know, science.

37:08.160 --> 37:10.481
So, he exploded.

37:10.560 --> 37:12.801
Spontaneously combusted.

37:12.880 --> 37:16.965
Is it possible the victim had some
sort of homemade bomb strapped to him?

37:17.040 --> 37:19.566
Yeah, sure,
anything's possible.

37:19.640 --> 37:20.721
It'll look better
on the report than...

37:20.840 --> 37:23.241
Yeah, we like bomb.

37:27.800 --> 37:29.165
Hey, Orson.

37:30.400 --> 37:32.368
You know, I still
don't forgive you for Hap.

37:32.440 --> 37:34.363
And I will never
forgive Angelina

37:34.480 --> 37:36.562
for what she did
to my brothers.

37:40.640 --> 37:41.721
Deal.

38:11.480 --> 38:12.561
Thanks for your help.

38:13.640 --> 38:14.880
It was good to get out.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.007
You did good.

38:16.080 --> 38:17.127
Thanks.

38:17.200 --> 38:19.965
Hey, tell that to my next
parole hearing.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.604
Stay out of trouble.

38:47.880 --> 38:48.961
What the hell do you want?

38:49.040 --> 38:50.690
My child. What do you think?

38:50.760 --> 38:51.921
I'm calling Nick.

38:57.920 --> 38:59.285
Tell him hi for me.

38:59.360 --> 39:00.646
I want you out.

39:01.320 --> 39:03.209
I know you do.

39:03.280 --> 39:06.363
I guess I should apologize for
Nick not being a Grimm anymore.

39:06.440 --> 39:08.920
But you should be thanking me
for giving you a normal life.

39:10.480 --> 39:12.403
Is that what you think
you gave me?

39:13.560 --> 39:15.289
I know you helped
kidnap my child.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.169
And I know
she's with Nick's mother.

39:17.240 --> 39:19.561
Then you also know that's
the best place for her.

39:19.640 --> 39:22.530
I'm her mother.
She belongs with me.

39:22.640 --> 39:24.005
It's never gonna happen.

39:24.720 --> 39:27.530
Thanks for that one-night
stand with Nick, by the way.

39:27.600 --> 39:29.125
It was a real Whopper.

39:29.280 --> 39:30.520
That's it, get out!

39:30.600 --> 39:32.523
I will,
if you come with me.

39:32.640 --> 39:33.687
Like hell.

39:35.120 --> 39:37.327
That wasn't a suggestion.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.524
Neither was mine.

39:42.600 --> 39:43.886
Bring it on, bitch.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.520
Is that all you got?

41:11.000 --> 41:12.286
Juliette?

41:15.720 --> 41:16.960
Juliette?

41:21.320 --> 41:22.845
What happened?

41:27.360 --> 41:28.930
Adalind paid me a visit.

41:30.240 --> 41:31.401
She did this?

41:32.680 --> 41:34.444
Did she hurt you?

41:34.520 --> 41:35.931
She tried to.

41:38.840 --> 41:39.841
I'm gonna kill her.

41:39.920 --> 41:40.967
Nick.

41:43.360 --> 41:44.486
I almost did.

41:45.160 --> 41:46.605
You almost killed Adalind?

41:48.520 --> 41:49.601
What? Did you shoot her?

41:50.400 --> 41:51.686
I didn't need my gun.

41:55.080 --> 41:57.082
There's something
I have to show you.

42:01.480 --> 42:02.641
What?

42:03.280 --> 42:06.124
You know how much
I love you.

42:06.200 --> 42:08.282
Juliette, just tell me.
