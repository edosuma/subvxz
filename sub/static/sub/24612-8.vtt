               But I'll always
              be in your life.

14:24.297 --> 14:28.032
             I know you've lost
             a few friends,
             but I haven't.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.935
      I'm not gonna let you ruin
             my perfect record.

14:32.506 --> 14:34.539
       [Sobs]
 Thank you, Charles.

14:34.541 --> 14:35.674

14:42.248 --> 14:43.648
 I'm ridiculous. I'm --
                     It's a lot.

14:43.650 --> 14:46.318
      I'm fine.
Just pretend I'm not crying.

14:46.320 --> 14:50.522
                 Seriously.
         Pull yourself together.

14:50.524 --> 14:52.257
               This -- This--
               This is a lot.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.592
       Sorry.
       [Sobs]

14:55.462 --> 14:57.728
              But, uh, I think
             I've found someone

14:57.730 --> 14:59.964
         to help you get settled
                 in Oakland.

15:03.337 --> 15:04.502
    Oh, come on.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.971

        Hi.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.577
   You look great.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.917
        Hey,
did I hear that the Frackers

15:19.919 --> 15:21.119
won the pennant this year?

15:21.121 --> 15:23.187
           -They did.
          -Oh, my God.

15:23.189 --> 15:24.823
   My God, Jules,
  congratulations.

15:24.825 --> 15:26.891
     I also did
some consulting work

15:26.893 --> 15:29.426
for Scranton Wilkes-Barre
    last season.

15:29.428 --> 15:30.962
 That's the Yankees'
      AAA team.

15:30.964 --> 15:33.031
    Oh, come on.
  That's big time!

15:33.033 --> 15:34.898
       I'm --
 I'm very impressed.

15:39.906 --> 15:41.873
            Alright, look, um...

15:44.244 --> 15:45.777
                ...I do want
          to tell you something.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.480
    Hey, I thought there were
 going to be tits in this movie.

15:48.482 --> 15:50.581
   There will be.
     There will.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.984
  So far, it's just a whole lot
        of Art Garfunkel.

15:52.986 --> 15:54.552
   Well, it's also
a young Mike Nichols

15:54.554 --> 15:56.187
growing as a visual artist

15:56.189 --> 15:57.656
and a very restrained
     performance

15:57.658 --> 15:58.857
by a young Jack Nicholson.

15:58.859 --> 16:00.391
But maybe your junky ass

16:00.393 --> 16:01.525
              don't see so good
                anymore, huh?

16:01.527 --> 16:02.460
         Is that the problem?
     It's okay.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.995
        Huh?
Get -- Get out of here!

      -No, they can't be --

   Calm down.

   we could talk?

16:12.139 --> 16:13.604
  Yeah, of course.
     I'm sorry.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.907
  Just go right --
   right in there.

16:20.746 --> 16:22.613

     Got kind of
a lot of down time here,

16:27.053 --> 16:28.352
      so I work
through some of that

16:28.354 --> 16:30.655
     by kind of
compulsively painting.

16:30.657 --> 16:34.025
I see that face in my dreams
 every single night.

16:34.027 --> 16:36.227
  I figure it's got
to mean something, right?

16:37.764 --> 16:39.697

of time on this shit.

17:05.324 --> 17:08.059
     Yeah, hey.

17:08.060 --> 17:09.260
             If you went through
                all 12 steps,

17:09.262 --> 17:12.262
            how come I never got
                 my amends?

17:12.265 --> 17:14.933
  That's the best part of having
       your friends get sober --

17:14.935 --> 17:16.467
              the apology tour.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.069
       Right.
                      Hey.

17:18.070 --> 17:19.936
             Hey, you can start

17:19.939 --> 17:21.406
                with the time
             you pissed the bed

17:21.407 --> 17:23.208
        and tried to convince me
                I'd done it.

17:23.210 --> 17:26.611
     Oh, shit.
             I couldn't produce
      that much urine in a week.

17:27.946 --> 17:29.147
I'm gonna call that,
but it sounds like me,

17:29.149 --> 17:31.282
 and I do apologize
      for that.

17:31.284 --> 17:34.019
    But thing is
that the program dictates

17:34.021 --> 17:35.753
 we're not supposed
to make amends if doing so

17:35.755 --> 17:37.355
 would cause injury
     to others.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.423
So, you know,
I figured if you were
happy and everything,

17:39.425 --> 17:41.425
  I wouldn't reopen
     old wounds.

17:41.427 --> 17:42.694

17:42.696 --> 17:46.297

18:04.917 --> 18:06.851
      You know,
it took me coming here

18:06.853 --> 18:09.687
to understand the truth that
you just kept trying to tell me,

18:09.689 --> 18:12.657
that life is a series
     of choices.

18:12.659 --> 18:14.525
   And ultimately,
I really didn't have

18:14.527 --> 18:17.262
  the power to make
   different ones.

18:17.264 --> 18:20.665
You know, the moments that I
beat myself up over the most --

18:20.667 --> 18:22.933
and not the dark ones,

18:22.935 --> 18:25.870
  those just led me
on the path to sobriety.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.207
What keeps me up at night

18:29.209 --> 18:32.143

I walked away from you.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.478
Now, every choice I made

18:33.480 --> 18:35.914
that took me in the opposite
  direction of you,

 so full of regrets,

 be my biggest one.

my best and go anyway, but --

it would be a good idea
for them to live in my house.

 a waking nightmare.

             at a very young age

  I just got tired of being such
  a burden on all my loved ones.

       was probably not gonna be

         No, if I wanted to undo
 all the damage that I had done,

                 in my life.

               if I did that,
