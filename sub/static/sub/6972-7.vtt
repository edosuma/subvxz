00:03.001 --> 00:08.000
It's important that you realize sonograms
are by no means an exact science.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.400
I don't want to alarm you or
have you jump to conclusions...

00:11.400 --> 00:15.200
...because honestly, it's not something
that we're perfectly able to explain.

00:15.200 --> 00:17.200
But I-I don't see anything.

00:17.200 --> 00:25.900
As I said, we may be premature in a diagnosis.
It may simply be... An intermediate stage of growth.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.500
But there's a problem.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.200
We see a development...

00:31.200 --> 00:35.400
...an abnormal bony formation
involving the upper vertebrae...

00:35.400 --> 00:39.600
...and something growing here
on the plates of the skull.

00:41.300 --> 00:43.200
Wayne...

00:50.900 --> 00:52.900
Sweetness?

00:57.900 --> 01:00.900
It might be nothing.

01:01.200 --> 01:07.000
I'm serious. Dr. Couvillion
really just wants to wait and see.

01:08.500 --> 01:13.000
I just... want it to be normal.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.600
Oh, Wayne...

01:17.600 --> 01:21.400
Let's go home, okay?
Come on.

01:54.800 --> 01:56.400
Thank you.

02:11.600 --> 02:14.900
I love you, Laura...

02:15.500 --> 02:18.700
No matter what.

02:19.100 --> 02:23.600
You know that?
Poopydoo?

02:25.900 --> 02:28.400
I know.

02:32.600 --> 02:35.500
Good night, Wayne.

02:36.100 --> 02:39.000
Good night, Laura.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.800
Sweet dreams.

03:08.900 --> 03:12.500
Wayne!
Wayne!!

03:14.800 --> 03:15.900
Wayne!

03:17.200 --> 03:20.400
Please, what are you doing?!
No...

03:22.300 --> 03:25.400
Stop it!
Wayne!

03:25.400 --> 03:26.900
Where are you?!

03:30.100 --> 03:31.700
Stop him!

03:31.700 --> 03:36.400
Please, don't take my baby!

03:37.300 --> 03:43.000
Please, don't take my baby!
Wayne! Wayne!

03:43.000 --> 03:44.100
Laura?

03:44.100 --> 03:49.400
- My baby!
- Laura, it's okay. Laurie, you're having a dream.

03:50.600 --> 03:54.600
- Oh, it was terrible.
- It's okay. Shh.

03:57.900 --> 04:02.800
It was... Trying to steal our baby.

05:10.700 --> 05:14.900
It's not the kind of case where
I quite know where to turn, you understand.

05:14.900 --> 05:18.700
Down in Hollins we do get our share of the oddball.

05:18.700 --> 05:21.800
On the whole, though, we're pretty
much like any other little town.

05:21.800 --> 05:27.500
You got your home break-ins, your
smash and grabs... nothing too wild.

05:27.500 --> 05:33.400
But given the victim's statement,
the unusually vivid detail...

05:33.400 --> 05:38.300
Well, I just had to take Laura's
word about her baby being abducted.

05:38.300 --> 05:41.700
I hear you specialize in these kind of cases.

05:41.700 --> 05:45.700
You've come to the right place, Deputy, uh... Stevens.

05:45.700 --> 05:48.100
Now this woman making
these claims she's your sister?

05:48.100 --> 05:51.000
Yes, sir. Laura Weinsider.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.700
I've heard about the things people been saying
about her, not to my face, of course, but...

05:55.700 --> 06:00.900
Real mean and awful things about
what Laura's part is in all this.

06:00.900 --> 06:04.100
Now it says here, a doctor's report
the day before revealed to her ah...

06:04.100 --> 06:06.300
...abnormalities in the ultrasound.

06:06.300 --> 06:10.400
Yes, sir, that is true, but
nothing conclusive, mind you.

06:10.400 --> 06:13.900
I see.
Okay, Deputy.

06:13.900 --> 06:17.700
We're going to put this
right into our priority caseload.

06:17.800 --> 06:24.100
I really want to thank you. I know Laura's really
itching to talk to somebody who will really listen to her.

06:51.800 --> 06:56.300
I know this went right into your caseload but I never
imagined you would get here so soon, Agent, uh...

06:56.300 --> 07:00.300
Oh, Mulder. Fox Mulder. Though I ask
you not to make that known to anybody.

07:00.300 --> 07:04.200
The FBI likes to keep our work
on these cases very hush-hush.

07:04.200 --> 07:07.100
Sure, of course but I would
like to thank Agent Spender.

07:07.100 --> 07:13.100
Oh. No, no, no. I'll thank him for you because
I have to call in my, uh, progress report.

07:13.100 --> 07:17.200
- I hope you have something to call in.
- Oh, me, too. All right.

07:24.900 --> 07:30.900
I kept calling it a nightmare... But how
many people's nightmare's come true?

07:30.900 --> 07:33.500
Not many.

07:33.700 --> 07:36.700
Certainly not in the way yours did, Mrs. Weinsider.

07:36.700 --> 07:43.500
When I was having it... it just seemed so real.

07:43.500 --> 07:50.200
You mentioned a fire in the room,
in your account and a, uh...

07:50.200 --> 07:53.600
...a devil that held your legs...

07:53.600 --> 07:58.100
- So that he could take the baby.
- But according to your statement your baby...

07:58.100 --> 08:04.700
- ...was not a normal baby.
- No. It was some kind of monster.

08:04.700 --> 08:10.000
With, um... horns and a tail.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.700
Can you excuse me?

08:21.300 --> 08:28.900
My wife appears so resilient, but I know
she's suffered ever since the doctor
told us about the complications.

08:29.100 --> 08:37.200
Um... You were right there in bed with
your wife the whole time, Mr. Weinsider?

08:37.200 --> 08:39.700
Wayne.
Yes. I woke her up.

08:39.700 --> 08:45.700
But according to... your wife's
statement, at one point she...

08:45.700 --> 08:52.500
...she reached over for you
in the bed and you weren't there.

08:52.900 --> 08:56.400
- Well, it was a dream.
- Yeah.

08:57.600 --> 09:01.500
Mind if I use your phone... Wayne?

09:02.400 --> 09:04.600
Sure, of course.

09:04.800 --> 09:10.100
Remember your truthfulness is important,
Mr. Ginsberg and as a prospective federal employee, ...

09:10.100 --> 09:13.500
...I will remind you to answer as honestly as possible.

09:13.500 --> 09:17.100
- Okay?
- Sure. Fire away.

09:17.200 --> 09:22.800
- "Do you, or have you ever smoked marijuana?"
- Nope. No, siree.

09:25.700 --> 09:30.400
"Have you consorted with people
who have now or in the past?"

09:30.600 --> 09:35.000
No... I really don't think so.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.900
- Scully.
- Hey, Scully, it's me.

09:49.800 --> 09:53.700
Mulder, where are you?
I waited 45 minutes for you this morning.

09:53.700 --> 09:59.100
I, uh... Before I tell you I-I'm going
to ask you to keep an open mind.

09:59.100 --> 10:04.500
- This isn't an X-File?
- Call it what you like. Here in Roanoke they're calling it a demon baby snatching.

10:04.500 --> 10:08.200
- You're in Virginia?
- Look, I want you to look at this woman's charts.

10:08.200 --> 10:12.300
Strange in utero deformities were detected.
I'm going to courier them to you, all right?

10:12.300 --> 10:17.500
Mulder, we are supposed to be doing
background checks not chasing X-Files.

10:17.500 --> 10:21.700
Scully, Spender just round filed
this case, it's unconscionable.

10:21.700 --> 10:26.600
- And what do you call rooting through his trash?
- Like that's any different from the assignment we're stuck with.

10:26.600 --> 10:30.700
"We," Mulder?
I'm stuck with it. You're not here.

10:30.700 --> 10:34.600
Scully, this is a classic case of demon fetal harvest.

10:34.600 --> 10:37.800
What they called in the middle
ages atum nocturnem, the impregnation of...

10:37.800 --> 10:41.000
...an unwitting woman by a
dark lord of the underworld...

10:41.000 --> 10:45.500
- As host for his demon seed.
- Exactly.

10:45.500 --> 10:49.800
- I saw Rosemary's Baby on cable the other night, Mulder.
- Yeah, but this is the real deal.

10:49.800 --> 10:53.600
You check that woman's charts, you'll get
hard evidence. Check her prenatal ultrasound.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.200
- Mulder...
- Just humor me, Scully.

10:55.200 --> 11:00.200
Take a look at those medical records.
I think they'll prove my theory.

11:09.100 --> 11:12.200
Wayne, have you seen my nightgown?

11:12.600 --> 11:14.900
I can't find...

11:15.700 --> 11:17.900
Wayne?

11:27.100 --> 11:28.900
Wayne?

11:34.300 --> 11:36.400
Wayne!

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Wayne?

12:51.200 --> 12:54.000
Laura?
What are you doing?

12:54.000 --> 12:57.700
- What are you doing?
- Burning leaves.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.900
As this time of night?

13:00.900 --> 13:04.600
Well, you asked me to rake up the yard.

13:04.600 --> 13:07.500
It was in the job jar.

13:09.200 --> 13:12.200
Hey, come on. You're making me feel weird.

13:14.100 --> 13:16.700
Come to bed, Wayne. Please.

13:16.700 --> 13:20.100
I will, honey. I just wanted...

13:20.100 --> 13:23.700
I just wanted everything to
look perfect when you woke up.

13:24.300 --> 13:26.300
I'll be right in.

14:24.300 --> 14:25.800
Mulder.

14:25.800 --> 14:28.400
Mulder, I think I found what you're looking for.

14:28.400 --> 14:32.100
I've been up all night going over the
medical charts on the Weinsider baby.

14:32.100 --> 14:34.300
What'd you find?

14:34.300 --> 14:39.100
The prenatal birth defects that you spoke of?
They're all here, but they're subtle.

14:39.100 --> 14:44.200
- Describe them to me.
- Well, they look to be discrete bony deformities.

14:44.200 --> 14:47.500
There are spurs on the
superior aspect of the scapula and...

14:47.500 --> 14:51.800
...small protuberances on the
skull adjacent to the coronal suture.

14:51.800 --> 14:54.200
"Protuberances?"
You mean, like horns?

14:54.200 --> 14:59.400
Well, they could be recessive characteristics
expressed as vestiges of primitive morphology...

14:59.400 --> 15:03.800
...or a developmental anomaly like craniosynostosis.

15:03.800 --> 15:06.500
Do you think this is something that
could be passed along by the father?

15:06.500 --> 15:09.500
No, I wouldn't look to the father as
any kind of dark force here, Mulder.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.200
I think it's the mother...

15:11.200 --> 15:16.400
...and Virginia law on third-trimester
abortions requires you to put her under arrest.

15:16.400 --> 15:20.000
- What are you talking about?
- Labor was induced, Mulder.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.600
In the mother's blood, there was found a
significant trace of an herb called mandrake.

15:24.600 --> 15:28.200
It's a poison that's been known
to facilitate self-abortion.

15:28.200 --> 15:32.500
- "Mandrake?"
- It's also been known to be used as an hallucinogenic.

15:32.500 --> 15:35.200
You think Mrs. Weinsider self-prescribed?

15:35.200 --> 15:40.400
Well, I called the doctor on a hunch and he said
that the father was very upset about the news...

15:40.400 --> 15:44.100
...while the mother was quite the opposite.

15:44.100 --> 15:47.300
Look, Mulder, I'm going to fax this
information to you so that you can present it...

15:47.300 --> 15:53.700
...to the commonwealth attorney for the county of
Roanoke but I think we have your baby snatcher here.

15:53.700 --> 15:57.100
- Mulder?
- Yeah? What? Yes?

15:57.100 --> 16:02.700
I suggest that you proceed very carefully. This
could be very emotional for everybody concerned.

16:02.700 --> 16:05.000
All right, thank you.

16:30.900 --> 16:33.800
- What are you doing?
- Sorry. I forgot my key.

16:33.800 --> 16:38.100
- Well, where have you been?
- I told you I was going to be on the road until Tuesday...

16:38.100 --> 16:40.500
Poopydoo.

16:40.600 --> 16:45.600
I was just so worried, Wayne.
We're getting so close now.

16:46.100 --> 16:54.200
Honey... I wouldn't let anything
happen not to our little bundle of joy.

16:59.900 --> 17:02.400
I'll tell you who's been taking hallucinogenics.

17:02.400 --> 17:06.900
She didn't take poison. My sister
had never even heard of... whatever it is.

17:06.900 --> 17:10.200
- Mandrake.
- "Mandrake." Where would she even get such a thing?

17:10.200 --> 17:13.800
- All I took were some herbal sleep aids.
- You don't need to say anything, Laura.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.800
Hey, why don't you just let your sister talk?
It might clear things up.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.300
- Not without a lawyer.
- She's not under arrest.

17:19.300 --> 17:21.300
You're damned right she's not...

17:21.300 --> 17:27.500
...and I didn't call you down here to tell me rumors
that I've already heard. My sister's no baby killer!

17:30.900 --> 17:34.800
- What's going on?
- They're accusing me of taking the life of our baby.

17:34.800 --> 17:37.200
- Who's accusing you?
- Who do you think?

17:37.200 --> 17:41.500
I don't know where you been, Wayne, but I'm
the only one keeping the dogs from the door.

17:41.500 --> 17:48.100
- Well, a man's got to make a living.
- Wayne... Mr. Weinsider-I-I don't want to arrest Laura.

17:48.100 --> 17:52.900
I'm sure you'd hate like the
devil for that to happen as well.

17:54.300 --> 17:56.900
- I should say so.
- So why don't you tell Deputy Stevens...

17:56.900 --> 18:00.400
...that it's okay to search the premises
so we can clear up any misunderstanding...

18:00.400 --> 18:05.200
- ...about who's responsible for what happened here?
- Of course.

18:13.500 --> 18:16.600
Laura, could you come here?

18:21.600 --> 18:26.100
Whatever else we find I know
everybody in this house is regular.

18:34.300 --> 18:39.100
I know there's nothing they're going to
find but why do I feel guilty anyway?

18:39.400 --> 18:43.400
Laura, there's something
I need to tell you about that...

18:43.400 --> 18:47.900
Something that I've kept secret for reasons
that I think will explain for themselves.

18:47.900 --> 18:50.600
What? What are you talking about?

18:51.100 --> 18:57.100
Well, I don't exactly know how to say this.
I'm sure that you might find it painful, as I do.

18:57.100 --> 19:00.300
Wayne, what?

19:00.700 --> 19:03.700
On the night...

19:05.400 --> 19:08.700
...the night that you lost the baby...

19:08.700 --> 19:12.100
...I had gotten up because I couldn't sleep...

19:12.100 --> 19:17.100
...and when I came back to bed, you were...

19:18.100 --> 19:23.900
You had... our little baby in your hands.

19:23.900 --> 19:28.000
You were in some kind of trance.
I couldn't get you to wake up.

19:28.000 --> 19:34.600
You keep chanting over and over
"zazas, zazas, nastanada zazas and..."

19:34.600 --> 19:35.700
Wayne...

19:35.700 --> 19:40.700
All I could do was take our little boy,
our little baby...

19:40.700 --> 19:44.500
...and wrap him up so I could make sure
that no one could ever learn the truth.

19:44.500 --> 19:50.100
- Oh, my God.
- And the other night...

19:50.100 --> 19:53.800
...when you saw me outside...

19:53.800 --> 19:58.000
- ...when I was burning the leaves?
- No! No.

19:58.000 --> 20:04.200
Laura, I was just doing it to protect you. I knew
that I could never bring back our little boy, ...

20:04.200 --> 20:10.200
...our precious little Wayne Junior,
but I couldn't bear losing you.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.500
Hey! Take a look at this!

20:31.200 --> 20:34.500
I don't know what to tell you.

20:35.800 --> 20:37.900
All I can think...

20:37.900 --> 20:44.800
When they told me that something
was wrong... that there was a problem, ...

20:44.800 --> 20:50.800
...was that this thing that was
growing inside me was evil.

20:51.600 --> 20:58.100
I kept thinking that maybe it was something
I did wrong and that this was my punishment.

20:59.300 --> 21:04.800
I told Wayne that everything was going to be okay...

21:06.100 --> 21:13.700
But I lied, but you have to believe me, Arky!
I didn't mean to kill it.

21:15.500 --> 21:19.400
I didn't know what I was doing.

21:19.400 --> 21:22.200
It was the herbal medication.

21:22.200 --> 21:25.500
- That's all I can think.
- Laura, Laura...

21:26.700 --> 21:30.400
I don't think you should say any more.

21:31.800 --> 21:35.100
I'm going to have to read you your rights.

21:36.000 --> 21:44.300
We're going to have to go down to
the station and do all that. I'm sorry.

21:59.600 --> 22:04.300
You're going to be okay.
I'm going to get the best attorney.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.100
I know what you are.

22:23.100 --> 22:27.100
I'm only happy when it rains..

22:27.100 --> 22:31.000
I'm only happy when it's complicated..

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
And though I know you can't appreciate it..

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
- I'm only happy when it rains...
- Hello?

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
- Hi, Betsy, it's me.
- Wayne, where are you?

22:40.000 --> 22:43.200
- I'm on my way.
- You're late, Wayne. I'm going without you.

22:43.200 --> 22:48.300
I want to be there, honey. I don't want to be the kind
of husband who isn't there every step of the way.

22:48.300 --> 22:52.200
You've already missed a lot of steps.
Anyway, it's just a sonogram.

22:52.200 --> 22:56.800
No, it's not just a sonogram, honey, it's a
picture of the expression of our beautiful love.

22:56.800 --> 23:00.100
- Wayne, what have you been smoking?
- I'm three blocks away, Betsy.

23:00.100 --> 23:03.500
I'm going to be pulling up in front
of the house in less than five minutes.

23:03.500 --> 23:06.900
- Okay. I'll wait for you.
- Okay. Five minutes.

23:06.900 --> 23:09.900
- Hey, Wayne. Where you going?
- What?

23:09.900 --> 23:12.400
- Who you talking to?
- Wayne, who are you talking to?

23:12.400 --> 23:15.400
- You seem like you're in an awful big hurry.
- Wayne.

23:15.400 --> 23:17.500
- I'm late for an appointment.
- Really? An appointment?

23:17.500 --> 23:20.000
- Appointment with who?
- A business client.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.100
- Wayne, I'm hanging up now.
- Right, you're in the insurance business.

23:23.100 --> 23:25.900
That must take you out on
the road an awful lot, huh?

23:25.900 --> 23:28.900
Look, I'm an insurance medical technician,
not that it's any of your business.

23:28.900 --> 23:32.400
So where is our appointment?
How far do we have to go?

23:32.500 --> 23:36.100
- What?
- Come on, Wayne, I'll race you.

23:43.900 --> 23:47.200
I only smile in the dark...

23:50.800 --> 23:54.000
Oh, hi, Ms. Britton.
Wayne Weinsider. Remember me?

23:54.000 --> 23:57.400
Harmony Mutual Insurance? You had
an appointment to have some blood taken.

23:57.400 --> 23:59.900
It's for next Tuesday.

23:59.900 --> 24:05.100
I know that, Kim. Can I call you Kim?
I was in the neighborhood and...

24:05.100 --> 24:09.200
...well, insurance isn't something you
want to be without, even for just a week.

24:23.800 --> 24:29.000
- What do you do with that?
- Oh, they check it out, make sure you're not a policy risk.

24:30.200 --> 24:33.100
Slow down, monsters.

24:36.500 --> 24:39.100
- Those your kids?
- Why, yes.

24:39.100 --> 24:46.200
I love kids. Got a baby on the way myself.
Seems like I've been trying forever.

24:53.400 --> 24:56.700
Those are fine-looking boys.

24:56.700 --> 25:00.100
You don't know how lucky you are.

25:00.100 --> 25:05.600
Two cells, with all that can go
wrong, and there they are... perfect.

25:21.500 --> 25:25.700
- You okay? You're not feeling faint, are you?
- No. I'm okay.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Can I use your phone?

25:40.700 --> 25:43.200
I want those kids out of my car.

25:43.200 --> 25:48.200
Okay, speed racers. That's enough
driver's education for today.

25:48.700 --> 25:50.900
Having your fun?

25:51.300 --> 25:53.700
- Yeah.
- Mulder, you're busted.

25:53.700 --> 25:57.300
- What?
- I just got an earful from Assistant Director Kersh...

25:57.300 --> 26:02.600
...who got a call from Mr. Weinsider
who says that you're harassing him.

26:02.600 --> 26:04.600
Leave me alone.

26:07.700 --> 26:08.900
Mulder...

26:08.900 --> 26:11.700
Mulder, I have to tell him something.
What do you want me to say?

26:11.700 --> 26:15.500
Tell him I'm down here doing
a background check on somebody.

26:39.700 --> 26:43.800
I got a message you needed to
see me, Laura. What is it?

26:44.400 --> 26:46.800
I'm afraid.

26:47.200 --> 26:49.500
Well, I've been meeting with attorneys and...

26:49.500 --> 26:54.400
...given the circumstances and your emotional
state they feel confident of an acquittal...

26:54.400 --> 26:59.900
- ...if that's what you're worried about, Laura.
- No, Wayne. I've been thinking.

27:00.100 --> 27:03.600
Thinking. About what?

27:03.600 --> 27:06.700
About your story.

27:07.600 --> 27:12.200
About how it doesn't make sense.
You said you...

27:12.200 --> 27:17.600
Wrapped the baby up to hide it but what
they found in the fire was wrapped in...

27:17.600 --> 27:21.900
...the nightgown I had on when
I woke up from my nightmare.

27:21.900 --> 27:26.000
But that's not possible, Laura.
You must be mistaken.

27:27.100 --> 27:29.700
And I keep thinking about...

27:29.700 --> 27:35.400
The face of that terrible
creature at the end of the bed.

27:35.400 --> 27:41.200
And I remember something
that I didn't tell anybody.

27:41.900 --> 27:44.500
Not even you.

27:44.500 --> 27:47.000
Laura, you're scaring me.

27:47.000 --> 27:54.200
No matter what you believe I only have one
desire: to protect you. To put this all behind us.

28:04.800 --> 28:08.000
Why'd you go and do that, Laura?

28:08.700 --> 28:12.500
You've got to know that I love you.

28:13.200 --> 28:18.800
And I just wish... you could've been the one.

28:19.500 --> 28:22.400
Let me go, Wayne.

28:39.000 --> 28:44.000
- What's her rhythm?
- She's still in v-fib. Charge the paddles to 200.

28:45.100 --> 28:46.700
- What happened?
- I'll start an IV.

28:46.700 --> 28:50.200
- She just collapsed.
- Clear.

28:51.500 --> 28:53.900
Paddles are charged.
Stand by to defib.

28:53.900 --> 28:56.200
- It was like...
- Clear.

28:56.200 --> 29:01.500
- It was like she died right in my arms.
- Charging to 300. Going again. Clear.

29:06.600 --> 29:09.900
- We got a heartbeat.
- What?

29:10.500 --> 29:12.800
Laura, can you hear me?

29:13.000 --> 29:15.300
Laura, can you hear me?

29:16.400 --> 29:21.300
I need to get this woman to the hospital right away.
I need a neurologist consult down at the ER...

29:21.300 --> 29:25.200
...hang an IV of lidocaine, and
et's get her out of here.

30:02.300 --> 30:05.700
- That was a long five minutes.
- I can explain.

30:05.700 --> 30:09.200
Oh, please, Wayne. I've heard all your excuses.

30:09.200 --> 30:12.200
Besides, everything went
fine without you. It always does.

30:12.200 --> 30:14.700
- Did you get the sonogram?
- Yes.

30:14.700 --> 30:16.700
Bring it back home?

30:21.400 --> 30:23.300
Is there a problem?

30:23.300 --> 30:26.100
The doctor found something.

30:26.100 --> 30:30.700
She doesn't know yet but there's some kind
of bony growths on the baby's spine and skull.

30:30.700 --> 30:35.900
It may just be a stage of development.
She really just wants to wait and see.

30:51.200 --> 30:54.500
Okay. Sure.

31:00.700 --> 31:04.800
Whatever happens, you know I love you.

31:04.800 --> 31:08.400
- No matter what.
- Do you, Wayne?

31:08.400 --> 31:11.600
'Cause sometimes I wonder
what's going on inside your head.

31:11.600 --> 31:14.400
Nothing but good thoughts.

31:14.400 --> 31:18.100
You and this baby are my hopes and dreams.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.800
Mine, too.

31:22.900 --> 31:26.800
Why don't I get you a warm
glass of milk and we'll go to bed.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.700
Okay.

31:40.200 --> 31:43.500
Mulder, you asked me to come down here
and then you're nowhere to be found.

31:43.500 --> 31:46.600
I was down in the basement at county
records doing a background check.

31:46.600 --> 31:52.200
Mulder... It's me.
That's your cover story, remember?

31:52.200 --> 31:55.700
That's where I was. I was piecing together
the history of the man that did this to her.

31:55.700 --> 31:59.800
Mulder, that's why I was looking for you
because, in fact, nobody did anything to her.

31:59.800 --> 32:04.100
Mulder, there is absolutely no evidence of
bodily injury of overdose, of suffocation, ...

32:04.100 --> 32:07.400
...of anything that would
explain why she was in a coma.

32:07.400 --> 32:08.800
Perfect.

32:08.800 --> 32:11.100
No, Mulder, I don't think you heard what I said.

32:11.100 --> 32:14.000
I did a complete medical review, just as you asked.

32:14.000 --> 32:18.700
What I'm saying is that there is not a shred
of evidence to implicate the husband or anyone.

32:18.700 --> 32:24.800
Not a shred of evidence is exactly the
evidence I'd hoped you'd find. Check this out.

32:28.000 --> 32:34.500
Ivan Veles, born Czechoslovakia in 1956.
Married twice, widowed twice, no children.

32:34.500 --> 32:40.000
Prosecuted twice for murder of wives Gisele and Helga.
Acquitted twice on lack of evidence. Who is Ivan Veles?

32:40.000 --> 32:44.800
Wayne Weinsider.
He's a Czech national, emigrated in 1994.

32:44.800 --> 32:49.200
He's also known as Bud Hasselhoff,
also known as Gordy Boitano.

32:49.200 --> 32:52.500
- Gordy Boitano.
- There's more. Read on.

32:52.900 --> 32:59.200
In Slavic societies the name Veles
was synonymous with... the Devil.

32:59.200 --> 33:05.900
From the Lithuanian root "Vele", a horned
demon who sucks the souls of the innocent.

33:06.600 --> 33:11.000
Mulder, you're not suggesting that
he is himself... a devil, are you?

33:11.000 --> 33:14.400
I'm not suggesting anything.
I think the facts speak for themselves.

33:14.400 --> 33:19.300
Mulder, I will accept that a man can be
demonic that he may have demon-like attributes...

33:19.300 --> 33:22.400
...but why would a demon,
if there were such a thing, ...

33:22.400 --> 33:27.000
...bother with a 9:00-to-5:00 "Make Room For Daddy"-routine
just so he can off his wife and unborn child?

33:27.000 --> 33:33.900
I don't know why; I'm not a psychologist but this
is the best explanation for how that I've heard.

34:10.800 --> 34:14.000
This will put you to sleep on a cloud.

34:14.800 --> 34:17.699
Where troubles melt away.

34:18.800 --> 34:22.300
Sometimes I remember why I married you.

34:30.199 --> 34:32.500
- All the way down?
- Yeah.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.699
They're checking it out now.

34:45.100 --> 34:47.100
It's pretty hard.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Get me the pick.

34:53.900 --> 34:56.800
We got technology out here.

34:56.800 --> 35:01.100
Subterranean mapping equipment out from
Richmond P.D. Still can't find a damn thing.

35:01.100 --> 35:03.000
Over here!

35:08.400 --> 35:11.200
Daniel, bring that light over here.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.500
You're going to find discrete osteopathic
deformities to the upper vertebrae, ...

35:17.500 --> 35:22.500
...two bony protrusions between the
parietal and occipital lobes of the skull.

35:29.900 --> 35:30.800
Good Lord.

35:30.800 --> 35:33.600
Put out an APB for your brother-in-law.
He's not going to come back here.

35:33.600 --> 35:36.000
- What are you talking...?
- Just find him.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.400
- Mulder, what are you talking about?
- He's done this to other women here, Scully, ...

35:39.400 --> 35:45.000
...just like in Czechoslovakia. My guess is that baby
we just dug up belonged to one of Wayne's other wives.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.700
What are you saying, that he's trying
to propagate? He's trying to breed?

35:47.700 --> 35:53.000
He's exercising his biological imperative and he'll
do anything or say anything he has to succeed.

35:53.000 --> 35:58.800
But it doesn't make sense, Mulder. If he's trying
to breed then why would he be snatching his
own babies and burying them in his backyard?

35:58.800 --> 36:03.600
Because they're demons and
he wants a normal child.

36:22.400 --> 36:25.300
No! No!
Wayne! Wayne!

36:26.000 --> 36:28.400
What are you doing?!

36:29.300 --> 36:34.700
Maybe you didn't hear me!
I said, what are you doing, Wayne?

36:43.400 --> 36:47.700
15527 Leahy.

36:47.700 --> 36:54.800
That's in Cave Spring. It's West Roanoke. Cave Spring.
Thank you. Thank you very much for your help.

36:57.500 --> 36:59.500
Scully, hold on.

37:07.400 --> 37:09.000
Mulder, where are we going?

37:09.000 --> 37:12.900
Harmony Mutual Insurance has a
second address for Wayne Weinsider.

37:12.900 --> 37:16.100
All the way across the other
side of Roanoke County.

37:16.100 --> 37:18.900
- Do you think he's got a second wife?
- Well, think about it, Scully.

37:18.900 --> 37:21.800
He meets or screens prospective
women through work.

37:21.800 --> 37:26.100
That's probably why he came to this country in
the first place, bigger gene pool more women, ...

37:26.100 --> 37:29.800
...and then he plants as many seeds as he can.

37:29.800 --> 37:34.600
Let's just hope he hasn't been
able to harvest many more of them.

37:38.500 --> 37:40.100
Mulder.

37:55.200 --> 37:57.200
Please.

37:57.700 --> 37:59.700
Please.

38:00.000 --> 38:04.500
He took my baby!
He took my baby!

38:05.300 --> 38:11.600
- It's okay, ma'am.
- Wayne. Wayne. He took my baby.

39:23.500 --> 39:24.900
Wayne!

39:27.100 --> 39:28.900
It's over.

39:29.900 --> 39:32.100
A normal life.

39:32.100 --> 39:35.500
A family. That's all I ever wanted.

39:35.500 --> 39:38.200
Where's the baby, Wayne?

39:39.800 --> 39:42.700
How could she do this to them?

39:42.700 --> 39:46.500
Put the shovel down.
Your lies won't work anymore.

39:46.500 --> 39:50.000
My lies?
What about her lies?

39:50.000 --> 39:54.100
Whatever the truth, Mr. Weinsider,
you can't hope to bury it now.

39:55.800 --> 39:58.600
I'm not burying anything.

39:58.600 --> 40:01.100
I'm digging it up.

40:01.100 --> 40:03.500
Where's the baby?

40:04.500 --> 40:08.300
Don't you understand?
She took it. Betsy took it!

40:08.300 --> 40:12.200
You can't blame anyone
else like you did with Laura.

40:13.300 --> 40:16.100
Don't you see?

40:16.100 --> 40:21.100
Betsy isn't like Laura. Betsy is...

40:29.200 --> 40:31.600
Get the paramedics!

40:38.500 --> 40:42.300
I just wanted what everyone wants.

40:56.700 --> 41:00.200
Hey! Don't even think about it!
You put that guy someplace else!

41:00.200 --> 41:03.500
- I don't want him in sight of my sister.
- Sir, he just got out of surgery.

41:03.500 --> 41:05.700
- Give me this.
- Hey, cut it out!

41:05.700 --> 41:11.600
Come on. You're in enough trouble as it is.
You don't want to complicate your situation
further by endangering his life again, do you?

41:11.600 --> 41:15.500
That son of a bitch better live so
I can beat the truth out of him.

41:15.500 --> 41:18.800
Find out why he did it... and how the hell he did it.

41:18.800 --> 41:22.300
I think the why is directly related to the how.

41:22.300 --> 41:26.000
What do you mean?
What do you mean by that?

41:27.000 --> 41:30.500
We should just go talk to this other
wife of his. This woman Betsy. Come on.

41:30.500 --> 41:32.400
Wait a minute.

42:28.300 --> 42:30.300
- Mrs. Weinsider?
- Flat line.

42:30.300 --> 42:33.800
- I can't believe it.
- Page Dr. Nyland up here.

42:34.000 --> 42:38.500
Just breathe deep, Mrs. Weinsider.
Can you breathe for me?

42:50.200 --> 42:53.200
Going to get a couple of more shots over here.

42:57.100 --> 42:59.100
How many?

43:00.300 --> 43:05.300
Four total. All here for some time.

43:05.300 --> 43:12.100
Maybe years. All normal, though, Mulder.
No osteological deformities.

43:12.100 --> 43:17.300
And Betsy's baby isn't here.
There are no fresh graves.

43:17.300 --> 43:18.900
I know.

43:20.100 --> 43:22.300
What do you think he did with it?

43:22.300 --> 43:26.100
- I don't think he did anything with it.
- But she was recently pregnant. I mean, ...

43:26.100 --> 43:28.700
I-I saw her records.
There are sonograms in the house.

43:28.700 --> 43:33.600
Showing the same defects.
These weren't Wayne's babies, Scully.

43:33.600 --> 43:35.500
Well, whose babies were they?

43:35.500 --> 43:38.900
I think Wayne realized something last night.
That's why he was out here digging.

43:38.900 --> 43:43.100
He realized that he'd met
someone even more evil than he was...

43:43.100 --> 43:47.100
Who would sacrifice what he
desperately wanted for himself.

43:47.600 --> 43:48.700
Betsy?

43:48.700 --> 43:53.700
It was no coincidence that she ran into us last night.
We were taken in by her just like Wayne was...

43:53.700 --> 43:59.500
...by a woman who would say anything or do anything to get
what she wanted, who was even more driven than he was.

43:59.500 --> 44:04.600
- Driven to what?
- To have what only Wayne could give her.

44:06.700 --> 44:10.300
I'm only happy when it rains

44:10.300 --> 44:14.600
You know I love it when the news is bad

44:14.600 --> 44:18.300
Why I feel so good to feel so sad

44:18.300 --> 44:22.500
I'm only happy when it rains

44:24.100 --> 44:28.600
Pour your misery down

44:28.600 --> 44:32.700
Pour your misery down on me

44:32.700 --> 44:36.700
Pour your misery down

44:36.700 --> 44:41.200
Pour your misery down on me...

44:42.305 --> 44:48.780
