WEBVTT

00:00.734 --> 00:02.401
Moves the ball.

00:02.403 --> 00:04.403
Swoops! Whoa!

00:04.405 --> 00:07.473
Adult adam:
<i>My brother barry,</i>
<i>a world-class athlete...</i>

00:07.475 --> 00:08.874
Doesn't count.
I wasn't ready.

00:08.876 --> 00:09.641
<i>...In his own mind.</i>

00:09.643 --> 00:12.144
<i>He dedicated his life</i>
<i>to hockey, hoops,</i>

00:12.146 --> 00:15.547
<i>And the art of dance,</i>
<i>or whatever this is.</i>

00:15.549 --> 00:17.783
<i>Even though barry dreamed</i>
<i>of greatness,</i>

00:17.785 --> 00:21.120
<i>One thing</i>
<i>always stood in his way.</i>

00:21.122 --> 00:23.422
No more karate!
End of story!

00:23.424 --> 00:25.391
<i>And that thing was my mom.</i>

00:25.393 --> 00:27.026
No karate?
Are you nuts?

00:27.028 --> 00:28.293
I'm the next
chuck norris!

00:28.295 --> 00:29.762
<i>She always had a tragic tale</i>

00:29.764 --> 00:31.930
<i>To warn us about the dangers</i>
<i>of everything.</i>

00:31.932 --> 00:33.665
That's what
esther carp's son said,

00:33.667 --> 00:35.601
And he got a big toe
right in his eye.

00:35.603 --> 00:38.170
Now he can't see color.
Is that what you want?

00:38.172 --> 00:40.506
Ruth rosner's grandson
was doing the worm.

00:40.508 --> 00:42.041
He cracked every vertebrae
in his body.

00:42.043 --> 00:45.244
Now he's two inches shorter.
Is that what you want?

00:45.246 --> 00:46.378
How much
will you be moving

00:46.380 --> 00:48.147
When a skate
glides over your windpipe?

00:48.149 --> 00:49.848
It happened
to judy muntz's nephew,

00:49.850 --> 00:51.083
And now
he can only communicate

00:51.085 --> 00:53.552
With a speak & spell
he wears around his neck.

00:53.554 --> 00:54.553
Is that what you want?

00:54.555 --> 00:56.021
Who are these people?

00:56.023 --> 00:57.456
Tragedy befalls all of them,

00:57.458 --> 00:59.091
And I have no idea
who they are!

00:59.093 --> 01:00.125
<i>My mom's constant smothering</i>

01:00.127 --> 01:03.562
<i>Led barry to take out</i>
<i>his aggression elsewhere.</i>

01:03.564 --> 01:04.897
Um, it's been
like five minutes.

01:04.899 --> 01:06.365
I can live
without the zagnut.

01:06.367 --> 01:07.266
Not on my watch.

01:07.268 --> 01:08.767
You wanted nuts
all zagged up in hot fudge,

01:08.769 --> 01:11.170
Cookie dough, honey,
and peppermint dust?

01:11.172 --> 01:12.504
None of those things
are in that bar.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.006
Barry's gonna get it
for you.

01:14.008 --> 01:15.240
Who's barry?
I'm barry!

01:15.242 --> 01:16.842
How do you not know this
by now?

01:16.844 --> 01:19.144
Wait! Come back!
I can do it!

01:19.146 --> 01:22.815
Come on, c4!
Let go, you son of a bitch!

01:23.149 --> 01:25.551
Nice moves, goldfarb.
What?

01:25.553 --> 01:26.485
I've been
watching you, kid.

01:26.487 --> 01:29.855
I seen you freak out
and melt down all over school.
Go on.

01:29.857 --> 01:32.224
You got that unhinged look
in your eye.

01:32.226 --> 01:34.026
I like it.
I like it a lot.

01:34.028 --> 01:36.395
My mother says my eyes
are the brownest brown.

01:36.397 --> 01:37.362
I've seen browner.

01:37.364 --> 01:38.297
But let me
ask you something,

01:38.299 --> 01:41.066
Have you ever
thought about joining
the varsity wrestling team?

01:41.068 --> 01:42.468
Have I? No.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.937
Well, we got an opening
in your weight class...

01:44.939 --> 01:48.640
If you're man enough
to handle the pain.

01:49.309 --> 01:50.008
<i>In that moment,</i>

01:50.010 --> 01:53.612
<i>Barry realized</i>
<i>how to win over lexy bloom,</i>

01:53.614 --> 01:54.880
<i>A varsity jacket,</i>

01:54.882 --> 01:58.016
<i>The holy grail</i>
<i>with cheap leather sleeves.</i>

01:58.151 --> 01:59.485
I'm in!

01:59.487 --> 02:00.586
Bring the pain.

02:00.588 --> 02:01.753
<i>Look out, hulk hogan.</i>

02:01.755 --> 02:03.322
<i>Barry goldberg's on the loose.</i>

02:03.324 --> 02:06.291
Ow!
Ohh, I heard something pop!

02:06.293 --> 02:07.493
<i>♪ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:07.495 --> 02:11.930
<i>♪ but nonetheless</i>
<i>I feel the need to say</i>

02:13.666 --> 02:14.700
<i>♪ I don't know the future</i>

02:14.702 --> 02:19.238
<i>♪ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i>clearer every day ♪</i>

02:19.372 --> 02:22.174
Adult adam:
<i>It was impossible</i>
<i>to be a kid in the '80s</i>

02:22.176 --> 02:23.542
<i>And not love</i> star wars.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.644
<i>It was the movie</i>
<i>that changed everything.</i>

02:25.646 --> 02:27.579
<i>It gave us lightsabers,</i>
<i>the force,</i>

02:27.581 --> 02:29.314
<i>And billy dee williams</i>
<i>in a cape.</i>

02:29.316 --> 02:30.682
<i>So you could imagine</i>
<i>how pumped I was</i>

02:30.684 --> 02:34.920
<i>When george lucas decided to</i>
<i>close out the trilogy forever.</i>

02:34.922 --> 02:36.955
Boom! It is upon us!

02:36.957 --> 02:37.823
<i>Return of the jedi!</i>

02:37.825 --> 02:38.824
That's right,
they did it again.

02:38.826 --> 02:41.994
And guess what, it opens
Friday at the hiway theater.

02:41.996 --> 02:43.529
Oh, my god!
That's amazing!

02:43.531 --> 02:44.129
Go away.

02:44.131 --> 02:46.765
You clearly don't understand
what I'm saying.

02:46.767 --> 02:47.799
More  <i>star wars.</i>

02:47.801 --> 02:49.501
We get it.
<i>Star wars</i> is your life.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.770
But if you still want
to have a life,

02:51.772 --> 02:52.838
Then stop pestering me.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.207
I'm sensing more resistance
than I was expecting,

02:55.209 --> 02:56.708
So I'll adjust
my expectations.

02:56.710 --> 02:59.411
Instead, I'll ask
that you pack a sleeping bag,

02:59.413 --> 03:01.180
Some rations,
and spend the night with me

03:01.182 --> 03:03.382
On the sidewalk
waiting for tickets.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.083
What were your original
expectations?

03:05.085 --> 03:07.653
Don't answer that
because I don't care,

03:07.655 --> 03:09.021
'cause it's not
happening.

03:09.023 --> 03:09.488
Please!

03:09.490 --> 03:11.256
Mom says the only way I can
do it is if you come with me.

03:11.258 --> 03:13.759
Mom only said that
because she knew I'd say no.

03:13.761 --> 03:17.129
Obviously, but she doesn't
know what I know,

03:17.131 --> 03:19.765
You love  <i>star wars.</i>

03:21.868 --> 03:23.602
(both grunting)

03:23.604 --> 03:25.571
<i>Bow before</i>
<i>princess leia!</i>

03:25.573 --> 03:26.371
<i>Never!</i>

03:26.373 --> 03:27.539
<i>Death grip!</i>

03:27.541 --> 03:28.941
(choking)

03:28.943 --> 03:30.175
<i>Reverse death grip!</i>

03:30.177 --> 03:32.044
(choking)

03:32.445 --> 03:34.213
I'm dead.

03:37.383 --> 03:38.984
I made copies.
Damn it!

03:38.986 --> 03:39.918
Here's how
this is gonna go,

03:39.920 --> 03:41.887
You're either gonna
come to the movie with me,

03:41.889 --> 03:43.589
Or this tape
magically ends up playing

03:43.591 --> 03:45.457
At your next
school assembly.

03:45.459 --> 03:46.124
I hate you.

03:46.126 --> 03:49.061
We're gonna have
so much fun.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.130
Hey.
Ask mom.

03:52.132 --> 03:53.432
I got
a permission slip for...

03:53.434 --> 03:54.967
Ask mom.
Mom will say no.

03:54.969 --> 03:57.803
Ask mom.
I need you to sign it.

03:57.805 --> 03:58.470
Ask mom.

03:58.472 --> 04:00.105
I'm joining
the wrestling team.

04:00.107 --> 04:01.807
What? Really?

04:01.809 --> 04:03.108
So you'll let me wrestle?

04:03.110 --> 04:03.742
Of course.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.911
You know, your old man
was quite the grappler

04:05.913 --> 04:06.712
Back in high school.

04:06.714 --> 04:10.182
I bet that's the reason
you're doing it.
Not at all.

04:10.184 --> 04:11.149
Tiny bit?
No.

04:11.151 --> 04:12.317
Maybe a little?
No.

04:12.319 --> 04:13.252
Not even this much?

04:13.254 --> 04:14.353
I'm doing it
for the ladies.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.255
You see, first you join
the wrestling team,

04:16.257 --> 04:17.956
Then you get
the varsity jacket,

04:17.958 --> 04:19.291
Then you get the power,

04:19.293 --> 04:20.259
Then you get the women.

04:20.261 --> 04:22.861
Everything you just said
makes so much sense.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.763
Let me teach you
some moves.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.198
No need.
Already learned them.

04:26.200 --> 04:29.067
How?
A little thing
called  <i>wrestlemania.</i>

04:29.069 --> 04:34.373
This is jimmy "superfly" snuka
doing the superfly splash!

04:34.375 --> 04:36.074
Aah! Ohh!

04:36.776 --> 04:38.410
Piledriver! Ohh!

04:38.412 --> 04:40.612
Atomic elbow drop! Aah!

04:40.614 --> 04:44.182
George "the animal" steele
is biting the turnbuckle.

04:44.184 --> 04:45.284
(grunts)

04:45.286 --> 04:47.119
Stop! Who does that?

04:47.121 --> 04:50.055
The claw! The claw!

04:50.057 --> 04:52.691
He's applying
the sleeper hold!

04:52.693 --> 04:54.059
Body slam!

04:54.061 --> 04:54.459
Aah!

04:54.461 --> 04:57.696
You do understand it's
not that kind of wrestling.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.064
What?
That stuff's not real.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.632
What are you saying?
None of it's real.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.901
If you're telling me
the iron sheik isn't fighting

05:02.903 --> 05:05.804
To protect his oil interests
in this country,

05:05.806 --> 05:06.772
Then my world
will literally cave in.

05:06.774 --> 05:09.841
Adult adam:  <i>Yeah,</i>
<i>my dad knew this was gonna</i>
<i>take some time to explain.</i>

05:09.843 --> 05:12.911
<i>Meanwhile, I was ready</i>
<i>to have the time of my life.</i>

05:12.913 --> 05:16.181
<i>Back then, you couldn't just</i>
<i>order your seats online.</i>

05:16.183 --> 05:17.249
<i>You had to wait</i>
<i>for days on end.</i>

05:17.251 --> 05:19.785
<i>Us</i> star wars  <i>fans were</i>
<i>the first ones to camp out.</i>

05:19.787 --> 05:23.555
<i>We were the trailblazers,</i>
<i>the coolest of the cool,</i>

05:23.557 --> 05:24.890
<i>And everyone knew it...</i>

05:24.892 --> 05:26.024
<i>Well, except my sister.</i>

05:26.026 --> 05:27.526
I want to
walk down this line

05:27.528 --> 05:29.328
And punch everyone
in the face.

05:29.330 --> 05:30.729
Stop.
We're gonna have fun.

05:30.731 --> 05:34.099
And who knows? We might
make some lifelong friends.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.668
(imitating yoda) hmm!
Hello!

05:36.670 --> 05:37.736
Master yoda I am.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.404
Sit next to you in line
we will.

05:39.406 --> 05:41.173
Much bonding
we will do.

05:41.175 --> 05:42.140
How old are you?

05:42.142 --> 05:44.076
46 on the 8th
I'll be.

05:44.078 --> 05:44.843
(chuckles)

05:44.845 --> 05:48.280
Oh, my god.
You have a wedding ring on?
Huh.

05:48.282 --> 05:48.814
Come on, erica.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.549
I know you're some big
high-school hotshot now,

05:50.551 --> 05:52.584
But admit it,
these are still your people.

05:52.586 --> 05:55.387
Okay, the old dude with
the puppet is not my people.

05:55.389 --> 05:58.724
And the guy riding the dog,
not my people.

05:58.726 --> 06:01.693
That dog is a tauntaun,
and you know it!

06:01.695 --> 06:05.230
Can't you just try
a little bit...For me?

06:05.232 --> 06:06.365
Fine. A little.

06:06.367 --> 06:08.633
What's up, mama?

06:08.701 --> 06:09.935
You ever tandem
on a tauntaun?

06:09.937 --> 06:11.770
Not as dirty
as it sounds.

06:11.772 --> 06:12.404
Go away!

06:12.406 --> 06:15.741
Ooh! She's as chilly
as the wampa's lair.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.576
Right? (laughs)
right? Am I right?

06:17.578 --> 06:19.478
Adult adam:  <i>As erica</i>
<i>was finally loosening up,</i>

06:19.480 --> 06:22.447
<i>My dad was helping barry</i>
<i>lock down that varsity jacket.</i>

06:22.449 --> 06:25.150
You seriously
want me to lie to mom?

06:25.152 --> 06:25.684
Yes!

06:25.686 --> 06:27.919
You really think
your mother would willingly

06:27.921 --> 06:30.322
Let you fight another man
with your bare hands?

06:30.324 --> 06:32.924
But I can't lie.
I'm a terrible liar.

06:32.926 --> 06:33.725
Everyone knows that.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.528
You just got to keep it
quick and simple.

06:36.530 --> 06:37.229
Here, let me think.

06:37.231 --> 06:39.264
What would you be doing
after school?

06:39.266 --> 06:41.600
Wait!
I got the perfect cover.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.602
We'll tell mom
I joined the army.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.904
That's what you're going to
tell your mother,

06:45.906 --> 06:48.073
You're going
into combat?

06:48.075 --> 06:48.540
Not combat!

06:48.542 --> 06:50.876
I could be one of those dudes
who flies a helicopter

06:50.878 --> 06:52.377
And drops in
bags of rice.

06:52.379 --> 06:54.279
So now you're flying
a helicopter.

06:54.281 --> 06:55.313
Think I can't?
No!

06:55.315 --> 06:58.183
I'm tired
of you not believing in me!

06:58.185 --> 06:58.817
I'm a good driver!

06:58.819 --> 07:01.787
Flying is just like driving,
but in 3-d.

07:01.789 --> 07:02.821
I don't even know
what that means.

07:02.823 --> 07:06.758
Okay, I... I think we got
a little off the rails here.

07:06.760 --> 07:07.893
L... Let's just move on.

07:07.895 --> 07:11.296
No! I'm not moving on until
he says he believes in me.

07:11.298 --> 07:11.863
Fine.

07:11.865 --> 07:15.033
I believe you can drop rice
from an imaginary helicopter.

07:15.035 --> 07:18.603
Here's an idea.
How about the school play?

07:18.605 --> 07:22.040
Tell her you got a bit part
like, uh, a palm tree

07:22.042 --> 07:27.345
Or, uh, a villager who goes
like this in the background.

07:27.847 --> 07:29.014
I can do that.

07:29.016 --> 07:30.182
You know what, al?

07:30.184 --> 07:32.451
This could actually work.

07:33.419 --> 07:35.787
Hi, handsome men.

07:35.789 --> 07:36.621
How's it going?

07:36.623 --> 07:38.490
I joined
the wrestling team.

07:39.091 --> 07:41.526
What?
Yeah, no. Never.

07:41.528 --> 07:45.630
Evelyn sanderson's son
joined a wrestling team.

07:45.632 --> 07:46.631
He put one foot...

07:46.633 --> 07:49.935
No. No need to tell us
that very tragic tale.

07:49.937 --> 07:53.338
Save it for another time.
Barry was just kidding.

07:53.340 --> 07:55.674
Tell her
what you're really doing.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.676
I'm in a play?

07:58.344 --> 07:59.511
Are you kidding me?

07:59.513 --> 08:01.947
Snuggle monster,
I'm so happy!

08:01.949 --> 08:03.782
What part in  <i>annie</i>
<i>did you get?</i>

08:03.784 --> 08:05.450
What's  <i>annie?</i>
<i>The musical.</i>

08:05.452 --> 08:07.486
There's fliers
all around school.

08:07.488 --> 08:08.787
Who are you playing?

08:08.789 --> 08:10.822
Um...

08:10.890 --> 08:12.858
I'm this guy!

08:12.992 --> 08:15.360
What is that?
What are you doing?

08:16.095 --> 08:17.729
What guy is that?

08:18.164 --> 08:19.731
I'm the guy.

08:20.099 --> 08:22.033
You're daddy warbucks?

08:22.201 --> 08:22.634
Sure.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.402
You're
daddy (bleep) warbucks?

08:24.404 --> 08:27.439
Well, I think
he's still a moron

08:27.441 --> 08:29.274
And it's a stupid idea

08:29.276 --> 08:31.076
And I am not
going to get behind it!

08:31.078 --> 08:33.912
He's doing the play,
and that's the end of it.

08:33.914 --> 08:37.282
You convinced me.
I now stand behind my son.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.116
This is so exciting!

08:38.118 --> 08:40.085
Ohh, I've always wanted to be
a stage mom!

08:40.087 --> 08:43.522
I'm gonna build sets and
rig lights and sew costumes,

08:43.524 --> 08:46.324
And I'll even be
an understudy if need be.

08:46.326 --> 08:46.725
No.

08:46.727 --> 08:50.095
If you dare
peek into one rehearsal,

08:50.097 --> 08:51.630
I will quit the play.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.631
You wouldn't.
I would.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.833
What is wrong
with my children?

08:54.835 --> 08:55.600
Why won't they let me

08:55.602 --> 08:58.003
Completely immerse myself
in their lives?

08:58.005 --> 08:59.437
It's okay, it's okay.
I'm okay.

08:59.439 --> 09:02.474
Well, I might not be able to
attend an official rehearsal,

09:02.476 --> 09:05.610
But that doesn't mean your mom
can't show you a few moves.

09:05.612 --> 09:08.513
I'm gonna go throw on
my leg warmers and leotard.

09:08.515 --> 09:10.982
A-dooba-dooba-dooba-doo!

09:10.984 --> 09:12.584
(chuckles)

09:13.586 --> 09:14.352
What just happened?

09:14.354 --> 09:18.657
What just happened
is you have to learn  <i>annie.</i>

09:23.029 --> 09:25.030
Good job, moron.

09:25.665 --> 09:28.600
Adult adam:
<i>We were only three hours</i>
<i>into our</i> star wars  <i>camp-out,</i>

09:28.602 --> 09:30.569
<i>But the long wait</i>
<i>didn't matter.</i>

09:30.571 --> 09:33.104
<i>I finally had my sister back.</i>

09:33.106 --> 09:34.072
So, I have a theory.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.041
<i>Star wars</i> takes place
a long time ago

09:36.043 --> 09:38.143
In a galaxy
far, far away, right?

09:38.145 --> 09:38.710
Of course.

09:38.712 --> 09:41.279
So, what if han solo
is frozen in carbonite

09:41.281 --> 09:42.614
For like
a million years

09:42.616 --> 09:44.416
And shipped to a planet
far, far away

09:44.418 --> 09:47.185
And that planet was earth
in 1940

09:47.187 --> 09:48.386
And he's thawed out
just in time

09:48.388 --> 09:52.691
To change his name
to indiana jones?

09:53.793 --> 09:54.326
Hmm!

09:54.328 --> 09:56.928
I have so much more
to say on this topic,

09:56.930 --> 09:58.697
But I drank all the soda.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.498
Dude,
that's our rations!

10:00.500 --> 10:01.600
Save my spot.

10:01.602 --> 10:03.868
Adult adam:  <i>Yep, erica</i>
<i>was letting her geek flag fly</i>

10:03.870 --> 10:07.672
<i>And didn't care who saw it,</i>
<i>until her friends arrived.</i>

10:07.674 --> 10:09.107
Erica?

10:09.109 --> 10:11.443
Lainey, hey!
Hi, hello.

10:11.445 --> 10:12.177
What are you doing here?

10:12.179 --> 10:13.645
We're going
to get cheesesteaks.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.046
What are you...
Doing here?

10:15.048 --> 10:15.747
What's up, legs?

10:15.749 --> 10:18.283
That's...
What I'm doing here, too.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.618
Isn't this
the cheesesteak line?

10:19.620 --> 10:22.153
Eddie's been asking about you.
Come with us.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.388
Yeah. Okay.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.957
You go ahead, and I'll
catch up with you in a second.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.425
Okay.

10:27.427 --> 10:29.427
Um, my brother will be back
in one minute.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.396
Will you hold this spot
for me?

10:31.398 --> 10:32.297
Hmm!

10:32.299 --> 10:34.065
Is that a yes?
Hmm!

10:34.067 --> 10:35.834
What is that?
Hmm!

10:35.836 --> 10:37.836
Just save
our damn place!
Hmm!

10:37.838 --> 10:39.871
All right. If you
come to your feet,
go for the takedown.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.906
Don't let him
get away with that!
More explosion there!

10:41.908 --> 10:44.075
Whoa, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
What?

10:44.077 --> 10:45.243
What are you doing
with the folding chair?

10:45.245 --> 10:46.911
You said to practice
our takedowns.

10:46.913 --> 10:49.447
The chair-bash is my
character's patented move.

10:49.449 --> 10:50.482
Your character?

10:50.484 --> 10:52.550
Yeah. For the wwf.

10:52.552 --> 10:53.585
They call me goldberg.

10:53.587 --> 10:56.287
My backstory is my parents
gave me up for adoption,

10:56.289 --> 10:58.823
And then I grew up on the
rough streets of philly.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.191
I'm sensitive,
so ladies love me,

11:00.193 --> 11:03.361
But I also have a raging side,
so men can relate, too.

11:03.363 --> 11:04.796
But this isn't the wwf.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.297
And as someone
whose parents really did

11:06.299 --> 11:08.133
Give him up for adoption,
I can promise you

11:08.135 --> 11:11.102
It's a lot more emotionally
complicated than that.

11:11.104 --> 11:11.970
Now,
put the chair back.

11:11.972 --> 11:14.372
Adult adam:
<i>While barry was having</i>
<i>a tough time</i>

11:14.374 --> 11:15.740
<i>Accepting this wasn't the wwf,</i>

11:15.742 --> 11:19.444
<i>He was having an even</i>
<i>tougher time learning</i> annie.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.980
<i>♪ together at last</i>

11:22.581 --> 11:25.583
<i>♪ together forever</i>

11:25.818 --> 11:27.886
<i>♪ we're tying a knot</i>

11:27.888 --> 11:29.254
What's that, murray?

11:29.256 --> 11:32.223
<i>♪ they never can sever</i>

11:32.425 --> 11:35.126
<i>♪ I don't need</i>
<i>sunshine now</i>

11:35.128 --> 11:37.629
<i>♪ to turn my gray skies blue</i>

11:37.631 --> 11:39.531
<i>♪ sing it</i>
<i>from the diaphragm</i>

11:39.533 --> 11:43.468
<i>♪ I don't need anything</i>
<i>but you ♪</i>

11:43.470 --> 11:45.103
Ahh! Aha!

11:45.105 --> 11:48.540
I'm kind of wondering if
this whole thing is worth it.

11:48.542 --> 11:49.240
It is what it is.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.142
Adult adam:
<i>Pops and my dad</i>
<i>had helped barry</i>

11:51.144 --> 11:52.410
<i>Pull off</i>
<i>the perfect cover story.</i>

11:52.412 --> 11:55.780
<i>Unfortunately, erica wasn't</i>
<i>interested in covering for me.</i>

11:55.782 --> 11:57.048
Hey, that's my spot.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.783
My sister was saving it
for me.

11:58.785 --> 11:59.417
Where did she go?

11:59.419 --> 12:01.486
Like I care
what your sister would do.

12:01.488 --> 12:04.389
She went to get a cheesesteak
with her smoking-hot friend.

12:04.391 --> 12:04.989
Come on.

12:04.991 --> 12:06.691
I just went to the bathroom
for like 10 seconds.

12:06.693 --> 12:08.927
Sorry, man. But you should
have planned ahead.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.829
The smart ones of us
brought along someone

12:10.831 --> 12:13.298
We could trust
to hold our spot in line.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.966
Others
in more unwieldy costumes

12:14.968 --> 12:17.168
Have rigged themselves
with elaborate tubing

12:17.170 --> 12:18.136
And disposable
plastic bags

12:18.138 --> 12:20.105
So that they might quietly
relieve themselves

12:20.107 --> 12:22.240
Even while talking to
a stranger.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.975
Ahh.

12:24.810 --> 12:25.376
What?

12:25.378 --> 12:27.445
Can't a man "ahh" in relief
without being judged?

12:27.447 --> 12:30.115
Unreal.
Unreal, you guys.

12:30.117 --> 12:30.615
Seriously?

12:30.617 --> 12:32.417
You're not gonna
let me back into my spot?

12:32.419 --> 12:33.651
I'm just a boy.

12:33.653 --> 12:34.152
Seriously?

12:34.154 --> 12:36.554
Luke skywalker
was just a boy, okay?

12:36.556 --> 12:37.655
Rules are the rules.

12:37.657 --> 12:40.692
Good luck
catching the Sunday matinee.

12:40.694 --> 12:43.495
Adult adam:  <i>My sister</i>
<i>had done the unthinkable.</i>

12:43.497 --> 12:45.163
<i>She ruined</i> star wars.

12:45.165 --> 12:48.533
You're on the mat
sizing up your opponent.

12:48.535 --> 12:49.834
The ref
blows the whistle.

12:49.836 --> 12:52.036
He makes his move.
What do you do?

12:52.038 --> 12:53.605
I bounce off the ropes
to get momentum,

12:53.607 --> 12:54.973
And I spear him
with my body.

12:54.975 --> 12:57.342
Again!
It's not that kind of wres...

12:57.344 --> 13:00.411
I know, it's not
that type of wrestling.

13:00.413 --> 13:00.912
I get it.

13:00.914 --> 13:03.181
But those
are the only moves I perfected

13:03.183 --> 13:04.082
On my bed jumping around.

13:04.084 --> 13:07.051
It's true. I've seen him.
He's quite a jumper, this one.

13:07.053 --> 13:09.053
Okay, let me show you
a real move.

13:09.055 --> 13:11.122
This was my specialty
back in the day.

13:11.124 --> 13:14.926
You use your opponent's weight
and strength against him.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.227
You smell like sandwich.

13:16.229 --> 13:16.828
Shut up.

13:16.830 --> 13:19.364
As I lean in to you,
you pull back

13:19.366 --> 13:22.767
And use your opponent's
momentum to take him down!

13:22.769 --> 13:24.803
Oh, my god.
I'm so bored right now.

13:24.805 --> 13:27.238
Just let me hit you
with something!

13:27.240 --> 13:28.540
Pops, get me a 2x4.

13:28.542 --> 13:31.309
What are you doing?
No 2x4s! I told you!

13:31.311 --> 13:34.279
Beverly:
Barry norman goldberg,
look at me.

13:34.281 --> 13:36.981
Are you
on the wrestling team?

13:36.983 --> 13:38.783
Uh...No?

13:38.785 --> 13:39.450
Oh, really?

13:39.452 --> 13:41.286
Because I was just down
at the school theater

13:41.288 --> 13:42.587
Building an orphanage
for a show

13:42.589 --> 13:44.055
That apparently
you're not even in.

13:44.057 --> 13:47.091
What? You promised you weren't
going down there.

13:47.093 --> 13:48.293
I have a problem.

13:48.295 --> 13:50.595
Yes, he's on
the wrestling team,

13:50.597 --> 13:51.663
But that's a good thing.

13:51.665 --> 13:53.264
I was on the wrestling team,

13:53.266 --> 13:55.433
And look how fine
I turned out.

13:55.435 --> 13:59.204
(laughing) ohhhhwha!

13:59.672 --> 14:01.606
(laughing)

14:03.442 --> 14:06.244
How dare you
go behind my back

14:06.246 --> 14:10.014
And encourage my delicious
baby muffin to lie to me!

14:10.016 --> 14:13.218
Bev, come on.
It's not that big of a deal.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.018
Let the boy wrestle.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.721
Helen cutler's son
was in a wrestling match once

14:16.723 --> 14:18.156
And his head
popped right off

14:18.158 --> 14:20.258
And now he lives his life
as just a head.

14:20.260 --> 14:23.094
There's no such thing
as just a head!

14:23.096 --> 14:24.362
You need organs to live.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.663
Well,
tell that to helen cutler

14:25.665 --> 14:28.199
As she's carrying her son
around the grocery store

14:28.201 --> 14:28.933
Like a football.

14:28.935 --> 14:31.970
Well, where's his heart?
You need a heart to function!

14:31.972 --> 14:32.604
It's in his neck.

14:32.606 --> 14:34.873
He's got a little neck
with organs in it.

14:34.875 --> 14:37.008
Oh, so now
he's got a neck!

14:37.010 --> 14:38.443
What else has he got?

14:38.445 --> 14:39.477
Maybe a body?

14:39.479 --> 14:40.612
Everyone, shut up!

14:40.614 --> 14:44.382
All my life, you've been
treating me like a baby.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.417
Well, guess what,
it stops now.

14:46.419 --> 14:49.354
I'm a grown adult man
and I'm gonna wrestle

14:49.356 --> 14:52.357
And there's nothing
you can do about it!

14:52.359 --> 14:52.824
Nothing!

14:52.826 --> 14:56.227
Adult adam:  <i>Despite</i>
<i>my brother's goofy run,</i>
<i>he'd made up his mind.</i>

14:56.229 --> 14:56.895
<i>It was go time,</i>

14:56.897 --> 15:00.198
<i>But barry wasn't the only one</i>
<i>ready for a fight.</i>

15:00.200 --> 15:02.734
There you are!
You scared me to death!

15:02.736 --> 15:04.035
Where were you?

15:04.037 --> 15:05.003
Where were you?

15:05.005 --> 15:07.872
I asked you to do one thing,
stand!

15:07.874 --> 15:09.173
Just stand there!

15:09.175 --> 15:10.375
But you couldn't even
do that!

15:10.377 --> 15:13.011
And now I'll never see
<i>return of the jedi.</i>

15:13.013 --> 15:14.879
Oh, please,
just to spite me?

15:14.881 --> 15:17.348
Correct!
You ruined  <i>star wars</i> for me.

15:17.350 --> 15:20.652
From this point on, I'll
have nothing to do with it.

15:20.654 --> 15:22.353
Nothing!

15:26.525 --> 15:29.460
Dang it!
That's a collector's item!

15:29.462 --> 15:31.963
But I don't care!
(breathing heavily)

15:31.965 --> 15:32.597
Why did I do this?

15:32.599 --> 15:34.198
You made me lose control
of my body.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.967
You honestly want to know
why I left?

15:35.969 --> 15:38.369
I didn't want my friends
to see me stand in line

15:38.371 --> 15:41.239
At some space movie
that I got blackmailed into

15:41.241 --> 15:42.173
By my dumb kid brother.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.208
I blackmailed you
because it's the only way

15:44.210 --> 15:47.011
To get you to spend time
with me.

15:47.112 --> 15:50.782
And I didn't used to just be
your dumb kid brother.

15:50.784 --> 15:53.551
I used to be your friend.

15:59.058 --> 16:00.158
Adult adam:
<i>It had been a full day</i>

16:00.160 --> 16:02.460
<i>Since I banished</i> star wars
<i>from my life.</i>

16:02.462 --> 16:04.295
<i>I was in a sarlacc pit</i>
<i>of despair,</i>

16:04.297 --> 16:07.565
<i>That is, until a certain</i>
<i>princess rescued me.</i>

16:07.567 --> 16:09.834
Hey!
Get up. Put this on.

16:09.836 --> 16:10.735
We're going
to that movie.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.670
I told you I'm not seeing
the Sunday matinee.

16:12.672 --> 16:15.306
It's like wearing
somebody else's wedding dress.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.741
What does that even mean?

16:16.743 --> 16:19.844
It doesn't matter.
We're going today.

16:19.846 --> 16:20.378
How?

16:20.380 --> 16:22.747
Well, I told the theater
manager what happened,

16:22.749 --> 16:24.415
And he was
incredibly sympathetic.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.717
He's gonna sneak us in.
Really?

16:25.719 --> 16:29.454
I also said I would
go to dinner with him
and his grandparents.

16:29.456 --> 16:31.556
I really wish I would have
just stayed in line.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.491
Adult adam:  <i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>my brother was ready to fight.</i>

16:33.493 --> 16:36.361
<i>And according to barry logic,</i>
<i>if he won this match,</i>

16:36.363 --> 16:37.462
<i>Lexy would never forget</i>
<i>his name.</i>

16:37.464 --> 16:39.464
<i>And even though</i>
<i>he had a lot to lose,</i>

16:39.466 --> 16:41.966
<i>It was my dad</i>
<i>who had the butterflies.</i>

16:41.968 --> 16:43.901
How you doing, champ?
You nervous?

16:43.903 --> 16:46.170
I'm not nervous.
Don't be nervous.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.973
Uh, I'm a little nervous,
not about the wrestling thing.

16:48.975 --> 16:50.408
I'm just worried
about my catchphrase

16:50.410 --> 16:52.877
'cause once I say it,
I can never take it back.

16:52.879 --> 16:55.046
I was thinking,
"welcome to the mat."

16:55.048 --> 16:55.646
No catchphrase.

16:55.648 --> 16:56.981
Goldberg,
quit trading recipes.

16:56.983 --> 16:59.317
Let's go! You're up!
Let's go, let's go!

16:59.319 --> 17:00.118
Look alive! Come on!

17:00.120 --> 17:03.588
(europe's  <i>the final countdown</i>
<i>plays)</i>

17:03.590 --> 17:04.856
Adult adam:
<i>This was it,</i>

17:04.858 --> 17:07.258
<i>The start of</i>
<i>my brother's wrestling career,</i>

17:07.260 --> 17:09.794
<i>And nothing was</i>
<i>gonna stop him.</i>

17:12.097 --> 17:14.665
I said no!

17:14.667 --> 17:15.666
Mom?

17:15.668 --> 17:17.668
Are you kidding me right now?
Move.

17:17.670 --> 17:20.571
I will not move.
I will never move.

17:20.573 --> 17:21.572
You're my special boy.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.174
If you end up
being just a head,

17:23.176 --> 17:25.176
Then I have failed
as a mother.

17:25.178 --> 17:26.644
No.

17:26.646 --> 17:27.445
No.

17:27.447 --> 17:29.313
Barry!
What did I say?

17:29.315 --> 17:31.182
What did I say?
What did, ohh!

17:31.184 --> 17:31.816
(crowd gasps)

17:31.818 --> 17:34.452
Mom, lexy bloom
is watching me right now.

17:34.454 --> 17:35.987
What the hell
are you doing?

17:35.989 --> 17:37.755
I'm saving your life.

17:37.757 --> 17:38.990
Bevy, no!

17:38.992 --> 17:39.757
I love you, honey!

17:39.759 --> 17:42.894
I love you so much!
I will never let you go!

17:42.896 --> 17:44.962
Don't fight back!

17:44.964 --> 17:46.431
Go limp under mama!

17:46.433 --> 17:47.965
And we're off the rails
again.

17:47.967 --> 17:51.469
Dad, help me!
She's so strong!
Murray: I'm trying!

17:51.471 --> 17:53.638
Tap out, barry.
Barry, tap out!

17:53.640 --> 17:55.740
I'm tapping out!
Tap out, barry!

17:56.442 --> 17:58.676
You are a nightmare,
okay?

17:58.678 --> 18:01.279
Now lexy bloom will never
follow me to college

18:01.281 --> 18:02.046
On a wrestling
scholarship.

18:02.048 --> 18:05.917
You have no right
to be mad at me, no right!

18:05.919 --> 18:09.921
You're the one who lied
and directly defied my orders.

18:09.923 --> 18:10.788
True story.
Oh, here we go!

18:10.790 --> 18:13.124
Susie goodman's son
defied her at one point.
I don't care!

18:13.126 --> 18:14.192
How do you know
so many sad people?

18:14.194 --> 18:16.194
And do you know that
that resulted in his tragic...

18:16.196 --> 18:17.361
Enough!

18:17.363 --> 18:17.962
All right, bevy,

18:17.964 --> 18:20.798
No one loves a tragic
parenting tale more than you.

18:20.800 --> 18:24.435
Did you ever hear the one
about beverly goldberg's son?

18:24.437 --> 18:26.504
He got
utterly dominated by her

18:26.506 --> 18:31.676
In front of the whole school
and was made a laughingstock.

18:32.344 --> 18:33.077
Oh, my god.

18:33.079 --> 18:35.413
That is kind of what happened,
isn't it?

18:35.415 --> 18:36.647
Honey,
at a certain point,

18:36.649 --> 18:39.484
You're only hurting them
by holding them back.

18:39.486 --> 18:40.318
Well, the damage is done.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.620
Not yet.
(europe's  <i>the final countdown</i>
<i>plays)</i>

18:42.622 --> 18:42.987
What?

18:42.989 --> 18:44.689
There is a way
to make people forget

18:44.691 --> 18:46.591
The terrible things
they saw today,

18:46.593 --> 18:50.094
And that's for you to go out
and pulverize this kid

18:50.096 --> 18:52.430
And show him
why your catchphrase

18:52.432 --> 18:53.831
Is "welcome to the mat!"

18:53.833 --> 18:55.900
Or something better
that you think of

18:55.902 --> 18:57.001
On your way out there.

18:57.003 --> 19:01.806
And, bevy,
I will hold your hand
through the whole thing.

19:04.243 --> 19:05.977
Go get 'em, boopie.

19:08.647 --> 19:09.480
(roars)

19:09.482 --> 19:12.783
Adult adam:  <i>That day,</i>
<i>my brother and I</i>
<i>each opened a door</i>

19:12.785 --> 19:14.485
<i>That would change our lives</i>
<i>forever.</i>

19:14.487 --> 19:18.322
<i>I'll always remember</i>
<i>stepping into my little</i>
<i>hometown theater,</i>

19:18.324 --> 19:18.923
<i>Heart pounding,</i>

19:18.925 --> 19:21.259
<i>Knowing that I was about</i>
<i>to watch pure magic,</i>

19:21.261 --> 19:24.428
<i>And it was all thanks</i>
<i>to my sister.</i>

19:24.430 --> 19:27.431
(cheering and applauding)

19:29.101 --> 19:29.700
That's funny.

19:29.702 --> 19:32.470
I was expecting
to wrestle your mom.

19:32.638 --> 19:34.172
(whistle blows)

19:35.340 --> 19:37.742
(cheers and applause)

19:37.744 --> 19:38.876
Whoa!

19:38.878 --> 19:40.244
Ohh!

19:40.246 --> 19:41.546
Wow!

19:41.548 --> 19:42.847
Welcome to the mat!

19:42.849 --> 19:44.248
All right, goldberg!

19:44.250 --> 19:45.650
I taught him that move!

19:45.652 --> 19:47.285
He learned that from me!

19:47.287 --> 19:48.152
More or less.

19:48.154 --> 19:49.520
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

19:49.522 --> 19:51.622
I've always wanted to be
a wrestling mom!

19:51.624 --> 19:53.591
I can't hear you?

19:53.593 --> 19:56.127
Goldberg can't hear you!

19:56.129 --> 19:57.728
(cheers and applause)

19:57.730 --> 19:59.096
You know it, girl!

19:59.098 --> 20:00.031
I'm tough, but gentle,

20:00.033 --> 20:03.601
And we're gonna ride a horse
into the sun.

20:04.836 --> 20:05.369
Yeah! Yeah!

20:05.371 --> 20:07.238

No! No!

It's over.

20:15.315 --> 20:18.549
It's over.
You won. You won.
