WEBVTT

00:11.000 --> 00:13.200
[narrator] <i>I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.</i>

00:13.280 --> 00:16.040
<i>I helped the Saxons defeat the Danes.</i>

00:17.040 --> 00:21.320
<i>Cnut was killed,</i>
<i>but I left Brida to a terrible fate.</i>

00:21.400 --> 00:22.840
Send me to Valhalla.

00:22.920 --> 00:24.080
[Rhodri] Take the pagan bitch!

00:24.160 --> 00:25.880
-[whimpers]
-[Uhtred] Brida!

00:25.960 --> 00:30.120
<i>As Aethelred lay dying,</i>
<i>new dangers arose in Aegelesburg.</i>

00:30.200 --> 00:31.880
We will betroth the Lady Aelfwynn

00:31.960 --> 00:34.560
to the successor
and seal the bond between our lands.

00:34.640 --> 00:37.439
[Aethelflaed] <i>I am concerned</i>
<i>about the fate of our daughter.</i>

00:37.520 --> 00:39.120
So, what is it that you want?

00:39.200 --> 00:42.880
At the very least, you agree not
to betroth her to some heartless fool.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.920
The king wishes to betroth me
to your daughter.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.280
No, I will not agree to it.

00:48.360 --> 00:49.960
[Aethelred grunts]

00:52.680 --> 00:53.520
[neck snaps]

00:54.200 --> 00:57.400
Have Aethelflaed confined
until this is settled.

00:58.360 --> 01:01.200
<i>She was rescued by an unexpected ally.</i>

01:01.280 --> 01:03.520
Come, I’ve alerted the man
that protects you.

01:03.600 --> 01:04.800
He’s outside the window.

01:04.880 --> 01:09.480
<i>And I have pledged to protect Aelfwynn</i>
<i>on the dangerous road that lies ahead.</i>

01:09.560 --> 01:11.480
Stiorra, get the children on the cart.

01:11.560 --> 01:13.280
We head north towards Ceaster!

01:14.000 --> 01:15.680
<i>Destiny is all!</i>

01:56.880 --> 01:58.640
[sobs]

01:59.480 --> 02:00.600
[coughs]

02:05.320 --> 02:07.120
Stop crying! I cannot bear it!

02:07.200 --> 02:08.200
Be kind.

02:09.240 --> 02:10.400
She wants her mother.

02:10.480 --> 02:11.960
We survived without a mother.

02:12.440 --> 02:15.360
You must be stronger. Be grateful.

02:15.440 --> 02:17.560
Better this than being wed to an old man.

02:18.560 --> 02:20.000
[sobs]

02:26.200 --> 02:27.160
[Uhtred] Do we stop?

02:27.240 --> 02:31.360
No. Edward and his men
will be half a day behind us at most.

02:31.600 --> 02:34.160
We must move faster to have any chance.

02:48.320 --> 02:50.320
I bring a message from Lady Aethelflaed.

02:51.360 --> 02:52.680
Did your brother send you?

02:52.760 --> 02:54.640
No, he does not know I am here.

02:55.120 --> 02:57.480
He imprisoned Lady Aethelflaed,
but I released her.

02:59.040 --> 03:01.600
-Why should I believe you?
-I do not lie.

03:02.160 --> 03:03.480
How did you find us?

03:03.560 --> 03:07.160
Lady Aethelflaed herself said you spoke
of traveling the road to Ceaster.

03:07.240 --> 03:08.320
There’s no one else, Lord.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.400
-And you took the road alone?
-Yes.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.880
And she wants you to meet her
at the ruins of St. Milburg's Priory.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.800
St. Milburg is on the road to Wenloca,
and we have passed it.

03:18.880 --> 03:20.840
It might be a trick to divert us.

03:21.720 --> 03:25.000
I’ve done what I promised.
You can choose to believe it or not.

03:25.480 --> 03:27.360
-And where do you go?
-I do not care!

03:28.960 --> 03:30.280
I have family in Frankia.

03:30.600 --> 03:31.960
That way is inland.

03:33.640 --> 03:35.400
Ships come in near Ceaster.

03:35.480 --> 03:37.480
Travel with us. We will show you.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.440
If she's lying,
at least she’s under our control.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.080
I’m sick of being controlled.

03:43.360 --> 03:44.440
Then travel alone.

03:49.240 --> 03:50.640
When did Aethelflaed leave?

03:51.600 --> 03:53.000
Last night, in haste.

03:53.480 --> 03:56.280
Without much silver
and only Lord Aldhelm to protect her.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.800
Then she may be at Wenloca already.

04:01.320 --> 04:02.920
We should ride back to meet her.

04:03.640 --> 04:05.840
Lord, we should not do this.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.120
If she found us, so will they.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.560
Are you good with children?

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Not really.

04:18.440 --> 04:19.800
Excellent, neither are we.

04:20.280 --> 04:21.279
We go back!

04:25.839 --> 04:27.880
[low murmuring]

04:37.320 --> 04:40.480
We will seize Uhtred's lands in Coccham
and take his children.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.920
He will pay for abducting
a child of my blood.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.520
We think his children are with him.

04:44.600 --> 04:47.160
He was seen on the road
with a number of children.

04:47.840 --> 04:51.560
Speak of this to no one.
We need to maintain a semblance of order.

04:51.640 --> 04:54.000
I fear doubts were already whispered
by the Ealdormen.

04:54.080 --> 04:56.000
They want my betrothal agreed.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.440
Then say it is agreed
and that I have decided.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.680
With respect, Lord,
your decision is not final here.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.400
Lord King, the priests are telling me
that the room

05:04.480 --> 05:06.680
offered to Aethelflaed to grieve is empty.

05:06.760 --> 05:10.960
-It appears she has also left Aegelesburg.
-She conspired with Uhtred to betray us.

05:11.040 --> 05:14.480
They are saying your sister Eadith
was the one who conspired to release her.

05:14.560 --> 05:17.440
Then all these traitors
should be dragged back on their knees.

05:19.240 --> 05:21.520
I apologize, Lord,
I speak only out of frustration.

05:21.600 --> 05:26.200
Aethelflaed is in grief and does not
know herself. Get your men to track them.

05:26.280 --> 05:29.200
-Let me take the Mercian Guard--
-No. Cenric's men will find them.

05:29.280 --> 05:31.360
It is better you stay here
and maintain a sense

05:31.440 --> 05:33.280
that everything is proceeding
as it should be.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.960
They must hurry.
The danger of division is real.

05:37.440 --> 05:40.840
Ludeca is appeased for now,
but Burgred is stirring up the Ealdormen

05:40.920 --> 05:42.880
against the match and against Wessex.

05:43.480 --> 05:46.520
What if the Ealdormen discover
Lady Aethelflaed and Aelfwynn are missing?

05:46.600 --> 05:49.920
They will not discover that,
because all the fugitives will be found.

05:50.800 --> 05:52.840
[Finan] I’ve not asked.
[Sihtric] It's a bit stale.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.920
That bread is so stale,
it’ll take a tooth out!

05:55.000 --> 05:57.120
Leave the fresher bread for the children.

05:58.560 --> 06:00.360
My men have the stomachs of dogs.

06:01.440 --> 06:02.600
That’s very true.

06:02.680 --> 06:07.320
-In fact, I once ate a dog.
-[Finan] I always said you were barking!

06:08.200 --> 06:10.320
You are kinder than your reputation, Lord.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.560
-Lady Aethelflaed is lucky you serve her.
-I do not serve her.

06:15.040 --> 06:16.440
But I owe her my respect.

06:17.880 --> 06:20.840
I never sought to disrespect her,
only protect my brother.

06:21.920 --> 06:23.720
And did he protect you in return?

06:24.480 --> 06:25.920
You know the answer to that.

06:34.280 --> 06:37.160
-[screams] No! No! Father!
-Lord!

06:37.960 --> 06:40.720
Go back! Stay back! The road is closed!

06:43.160 --> 06:44.160
[beggar] Let go!

06:44.640 --> 06:45.720
-Move!
-Stop there!

07:03.080 --> 07:04.640
[gags and coughs]

07:06.520 --> 07:07.480
Stay back!

07:07.560 --> 07:10.440
Lord, stay back! It's the sickness.
They’re dying of the sickness!

07:14.120 --> 07:16.120
[both grunt]

07:22.920 --> 07:24.200
It was a kindness, Lord.

07:26.960 --> 07:28.320
Which hand did he grab?

07:33.160 --> 07:34.160
Leave her be.

07:34.240 --> 07:35.720
Lord, it is spread by touch.

07:35.800 --> 07:38.560
No, it is the air that spreads it.
Do you have it?

07:38.640 --> 07:39.560
-No!
-No!

07:39.640 --> 07:40.880
Go!

07:41.760 --> 07:43.880
And the animals,
we should kill the horses.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.320
Father, what if I breathed the air?

07:46.400 --> 07:48.520
It will not matter. It only takes sinners.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.920
That’s not true. Your father’s right.
It’s in the air.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.120
-It could take us, any one of us.
-We should return to Aegelesburg.

07:54.200 --> 07:56.240
-If there's sickness in the land--
-We cannot go back.

07:56.320 --> 07:59.680
We cannot defend ourselves
against Edward's men or Mercian Guards.

07:59.760 --> 08:01.520
Better to die in a fight
than choking blood.

08:01.600 --> 08:05.840
We go across land to Wenloca,
abandon the path, avoid the bad air.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.840
The children will not make it on foot.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.880
Then we leave them...
somewhere safe and then--

08:10.960 --> 08:12.480
I will not leave the children!

08:12.560 --> 08:14.200
But, Lord...

08:15.120 --> 08:17.480
Lord, I have followed you
without complaint,

08:17.560 --> 08:19.720
but do not inflict this on men
who’ve been loyal to you.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.920
Finan, we have no choice.
We have to alter the plan.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.080
We'll leave the horses somewhere safe.
We’ll go across land to Wenloca on foot.

08:29.320 --> 08:31.440
We’ll be safe from the sickness, trust me.

08:35.400 --> 08:36.640
-All right?
-Hm.

08:37.720 --> 08:40.880
We go to Wenloca!
We find Aethelflaed and we get to Ceaster.

08:43.280 --> 08:45.200
Let’s find a place to hide the horses.

08:48.159 --> 08:51.280
-Is this St. Milburg's?
-Yes. Trust the marker.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.960
We should get off the road
before nightfall.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.960
No. I will be here when my daughter comes.

09:04.480 --> 09:07.200
Aldhelm, what if Edward's men
have taken my child?

09:07.280 --> 09:10.480
What if she is imprisoned somewhere at
this very moment, not knowing where I am?

09:10.560 --> 09:12.160
Lady, do not torture yourself.

09:12.240 --> 09:14.480
Uhtred will have rescued her
and he will find us.

09:14.560 --> 09:15.760
He has never failed you.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.480
And yet this feels like failure.

09:19.880 --> 09:22.920
A daughter of Alfred
riding as an outlaw in her own country!

09:23.720 --> 09:28.040
Your father lived off the land for
a while. He survived and prospered after.

09:28.440 --> 09:30.800
In time, we will return to Aegelesburg.

09:32.360 --> 09:33.560
I’m not certain we can.

09:35.440 --> 09:38.840
I fear I may have led you along a path
from which there is no return.

09:40.320 --> 09:43.480
-Aldhelm, they may spare me, but I--
-I understand, Lady.

09:45.200 --> 09:46.040
I understand.

09:47.080 --> 09:49.160
[Burgred and family murmuring]

09:51.440 --> 09:52.320
It won’t be long.

09:54.040 --> 09:56.160
You must be strong. Think of your brother.

10:00.960 --> 10:04.280
-Who allows you into the King's chamber?
-I do not need permission.

10:04.360 --> 10:07.320
I am merely showing my son
where he will rest when he is Lord.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.960
You are a fool to pursue this, Burgred.

10:10.040 --> 10:12.360
It's as though you wish
to lose another child.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.600
Why would I be frightened
of Edward's puppet...

10:16.400 --> 10:19.280
when I have greater forces on my side?

10:19.360 --> 10:20.280
Who?

10:20.360 --> 10:21.520
Who are your forces?

10:21.600 --> 10:24.120
None but the Lord himself.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.360
There is a reason
we survived the massacre.

10:26.800 --> 10:29.760
God wants us to right the wrongs
done to Mercia.

10:30.560 --> 10:33.480
Nevertheless,
I will be betrothed to the child,

10:33.560 --> 10:35.280
and I will succeed the throne.

10:35.360 --> 10:38.800
If it is so certain,
why is it not yet done?

10:41.640 --> 10:44.760
I think the King conceals something
and lies to us.

10:45.960 --> 10:49.320
So, we will wait for our moment.

11:07.840 --> 11:10.200
-The crowds are growing.
-Yes, Commander.

11:10.280 --> 11:12.040
News of Aethelred’s death spreads.

11:12.120 --> 11:13.680
Nervous villagers seeking protection.

11:13.760 --> 11:17.520
There is a matter more pressing.
Find me 12 men to leave immediately.

11:18.680 --> 11:21.680
If Wessex is incapable,
we’ll find the fugitives ourselves.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.880
This many people on the road,
someone must have seen them.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.560
We’ll soon find them, Commander.

11:35.760 --> 11:36.720
Lord Ludeca.

11:38.080 --> 11:39.040
[messenger pants]

11:39.480 --> 11:41.680
-I’ve heard news. There’s sickness.
-Yes?

11:41.760 --> 11:44.600
-It is spreading across Mercia.
-Thank you. Let’s go.

11:53.840 --> 11:55.400
-No word?
-Not yet.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.920
-Could they have gone north, not south?
-It is possible.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.480
Keep them looking.

11:59.560 --> 12:02.840
We’re running out of time, Lord King.
Tempers are fraying.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.400
Father Pyrlig,
how do the preparations proceed?

12:06.480 --> 12:08.560
Forgive me,
but we should delay all ceremonies.

12:08.640 --> 12:11.840
They say the sickness is coming.
People are abandoning their villages.

12:11.920 --> 12:14.400
It ravages worse than any Dane invader.

12:14.680 --> 12:16.440
We have to protect Aegelesburg.

12:36.360 --> 12:37.320
Close the gate!

12:37.640 --> 12:39.240
We cannot abandon the sick!

12:39.960 --> 12:42.360
We risk spreading fever.
We must close the gates!

12:42.440 --> 12:43.640
Lord, overrule this.

12:43.720 --> 12:46.880
No, Ludeca is right.
More people will provoke trouble.

12:46.960 --> 12:49.160
We have a duty to protect all Saxons.

12:49.240 --> 12:51.640
You cannot close the gates,
when the people seek refuge!

12:51.720 --> 12:53.640
We have to protect the town, Burgred.

12:53.720 --> 12:56.080
The other Ealdormen would agree.
You know this.

12:57.200 --> 13:00.120
I hope your reward
for doing his bidding is worth it.

13:02.640 --> 13:05.280
Perhaps we should keep it open.
The people are clearly frightened.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.080
Frightened people frighten others.

13:07.720 --> 13:11.840
Overrule me on this and the Witan
will say you seek to conquer us.

13:12.640 --> 13:16.000
Besides, for now,
Burgred has no men to fight for him.

13:16.760 --> 13:19.120
Do not provide him with a readymade fyrd.

13:25.760 --> 13:26.640
I agree.

13:27.320 --> 13:28.160
Shut the gates!

13:28.240 --> 13:29.520
Shut the gates!

13:29.600 --> 13:31.880
-Close the gates!
-Get the gates closed!

13:31.960 --> 13:34.680
[villagers shouting]

13:45.760 --> 13:46.600
[baby cries]

13:58.520 --> 14:00.320
[angry and confused yelling]

14:16.840 --> 14:17.840
Where is she?

14:17.920 --> 14:21.080
Where’s Lady Aelswith? And who helped her?

14:21.160 --> 14:22.400
Who betrayed us?

14:48.280 --> 14:49.400
Leave the frogs alone!

14:49.480 --> 14:50.840
[Aethelstan giggles]

15:11.640 --> 15:13.480
Was I wrong to oppose the betrothal?

15:14.920 --> 15:15.760
No.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.360
You are trying to protect her.

15:18.440 --> 15:19.480
[exasperated sigh]

15:20.240 --> 15:22.960
Perhaps I should have accepted it all
with good grace.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I was married young and I survived.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.320
Lady, your husband wished you dead.

15:31.480 --> 15:33.280
Maybe that’s what royal husbands do.

15:34.280 --> 15:36.920
Maybe that’s what
I should have been preparing Aelfwynn for.

15:37.360 --> 15:38.440
[horse neighs]

15:55.800 --> 15:56.760
Hurry!

15:57.400 --> 15:59.400
For your own safety, don’t stay here!

15:59.480 --> 16:00.480
Do the Danes return?

16:00.560 --> 16:04.120
No. The sickness is taking young and old.

16:04.200 --> 16:06.400
Escape the foul airs while you can.

16:07.360 --> 16:09.720
The sickness has not struck
for many years.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.840
Follow us. We go north.

16:13.040 --> 16:13.920
Join them.

16:14.960 --> 16:17.120
No, we’ll miss Aelfwynn.

16:17.200 --> 16:20.640
Lady, do not be foolish. The sickness
takes all, regardless of rank.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.840
I would rather be foolish
than abandon my child.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.080
Do not ask again.

16:30.400 --> 16:33.800
[Stiorra sniffs]

16:34.560 --> 16:37.120
-He’s heavier than he looks.
-[Stiorra sneezes]

16:37.200 --> 16:38.040
[sniffles]

16:38.120 --> 16:40.600
-What’s wrong with you?
-I have a fever from the grasses.

16:40.680 --> 16:41.560
I do not have it!

16:41.640 --> 16:44.280
Finan, the sickness
would not strike this fast.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.120
You’ve not seen what I have, Lord.

16:46.680 --> 16:49.240
Oh, hey! How many times
do I have to tell you?

16:49.320 --> 16:50.560
You cannot do that!

16:50.840 --> 16:51.840
Who are you anyway?

16:52.920 --> 16:54.320
I am no one.

16:54.600 --> 16:57.800
He’s Aethelstan, Edward's firstborn son.

17:00.320 --> 17:03.760
Hidden child of Edward!
How did he survive this long?

17:03.840 --> 17:06.880
He’s driven by a mission to annoy me,
aren't you, Aethelstan?

17:07.400 --> 17:10.640
Better keep him safe, Finan.
That’s royal blood you're carrying.

17:10.720 --> 17:13.480
-Welcome to the bastard life, boy.
-[Sihtric laughs]

17:20.319 --> 17:22.720
You can smell it on the air.
They’re burning bodies.

17:23.160 --> 17:25.119
It means the fever is just fields away.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.079
Lady, no one has passed by for hours.

17:27.160 --> 17:29.839
They’ve probably closed the roads
to contain the sickness.

17:29.920 --> 17:32.079
Uhtred will have gone on ahead to Ceaster.

17:33.160 --> 17:34.280
We should do the same.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.240
-[Aethelstan] How much longer?
-[Stiorra] Again and I will not reply.

17:53.320 --> 17:55.200
[Uhtred]
It is right at the end of this field.

17:55.280 --> 17:57.560
We should be able to see
the cross any moment.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.560
We’re looking for warriors
traveling with children.

18:15.640 --> 18:17.840
Did these warriors bring the sickness?

18:18.480 --> 18:20.400
The sickness is on this road.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.080
We have no fear of it!

18:22.160 --> 18:23.720
It only takes sinners!

18:23.800 --> 18:24.960
Is that true?

18:26.920 --> 18:28.680
Move, I’m getting out of the bad air!

18:29.440 --> 18:30.920
I’m not risking the sickness.

18:32.840 --> 18:36.280
I will double the reward of every man
who chooses to stay!

18:47.240 --> 18:49.120
[clatter of sword]

18:54.200 --> 18:56.640
-What are you looking for, Finan?
-Bodies!

18:56.720 --> 18:57.560
Eh?

18:58.760 --> 19:01.120
Bodies! I know the sickness is close.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.160
Why are you shitting yourself?

19:03.920 --> 19:04.760
[sighs]

19:05.440 --> 19:08.360
I’ve seen men as strong as bears
at breakfast time...

19:09.600 --> 19:12.760
gurgling blood and pus by supper time!

19:13.320 --> 19:14.520
You little runt!

19:14.840 --> 19:17.480
Take Aelfwynn out of the sun.
It is not good for her.

19:19.120 --> 19:21.840
I’m sick of mothering her.
I’ve done it for months now.

19:22.880 --> 19:25.080
Think of it as training for being a wife.

19:25.160 --> 19:28.960
I will not become a wife...
hard work for too little reward.

19:36.200 --> 19:38.000
Lady Aethelflaed is not coming.

19:38.600 --> 19:41.000
Let's go,
not wait for the foul air to catch us.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.640
Lord, I promised her
I would send you to meet her.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.680
On horseback,
she must have been here first.

19:48.040 --> 19:51.040
She would have gone on to Ceaster
as agreed. We move.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.920
Hey! Look at Aelfwynn.

20:28.080 --> 20:31.080
[whispers] Her face is red.
She clearly sickens.

20:31.160 --> 20:32.760
She just needs some rest.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.280
We all do.

20:35.080 --> 20:36.480
-Go on.
-Let me talk to him.

20:36.560 --> 20:37.480
Go on.

20:41.600 --> 20:45.000
How long have we been on the road, Lord?
Two days?

20:46.480 --> 20:47.960
And no sight of Edward's men.

20:48.680 --> 20:52.120
They do not know the land up here, Lord.
Children need their rest.

20:54.280 --> 20:57.720
Worried about
your father’s grandchildren, Osferth? Huh?

20:58.880 --> 21:01.760
[Aelfwynn coughs]

21:13.920 --> 21:15.080
This is a good place.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.200
We rest here for the night.

21:19.280 --> 21:20.840
[Eadith] You can sleep now.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.480
Have the fugitives been located?

21:32.560 --> 21:36.880
No. Villagers flee in their droves,
but none seem to have seen your sister.

21:36.960 --> 21:40.720
What if the sickness has taken her?
What if we drove her into danger?

21:40.800 --> 21:44.000
-She left by her own choice, Lord King.
-Did she?

21:45.800 --> 21:48.120
Tell them to burn herbs
in the surrounding fields.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.160
Let the smoke drive out the bad air.

21:50.880 --> 21:53.000
Then we have done one good thing at least.

21:56.720 --> 21:59.760
Eardwulf has left Aegelesburg
with 12 of our best men.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.200
Why does he travel in time of sickness?

22:02.280 --> 22:04.840
He has gone to protect the Lady Aelfwynn.

22:04.920 --> 22:08.760
He is a man devoted to his betrothed.

22:08.840 --> 22:10.320
He is devoted to himself.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.680
And would risk the bad air
only for treasure.

22:13.760 --> 22:15.880
Anyone here could have warned you of that.

22:20.800 --> 22:24.360
-Eardwulf has gone to find Aelfwynn?
-Yes.

22:24.440 --> 22:27.120
You assured me he would do
as we requested.

22:27.200 --> 22:29.640
I asked him to remain.

22:29.720 --> 22:33.000
He is a man of action,
not a man of politics.

22:33.080 --> 22:38.200
In future, advise me better
in whom we place our trust.

22:42.720 --> 22:45.080
[crows cawing]

22:49.080 --> 22:50.120
[surprised grunt]

22:50.880 --> 22:51.880
[sighs]

22:59.440 --> 23:01.160
Hey! Good morning, Princess.

23:06.440 --> 23:10.440
Anyone who shits liquid
will be left behind.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.840
[caws]

25:45.000 --> 25:48.320
[guard] The gates are closed!
There’s no entry to Aegelesburg!

25:52.200 --> 25:54.840
Lord Aethelhelm, explain this to me.

25:55.880 --> 25:59.320
The Ealdormen have ordered
that the gates be held closed.

26:00.240 --> 26:02.200
There is sickness here.

26:02.960 --> 26:04.280
Speak to my son.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.440
Of course, but I'm sure he'll not want you
to be harmed.

26:09.560 --> 26:13.360
In fact, he might wish
that you quit Mercia altogether.

26:14.280 --> 26:20.600
Tell him I survived the swamps of Athelney
and am unafraid of the sickness.

26:44.640 --> 26:47.040
[pants]

26:52.280 --> 26:54.080
Lord, we should go.

27:08.040 --> 27:10.640
-I shall leave it to you, Ludeca.
-Are we certain it’s her?

27:10.720 --> 27:12.480
Sir, I saw her for myself.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.440
Why’s she not in Winchester?

27:18.080 --> 27:20.640
Ludeca, why is my mother being held
at the gate?

27:21.120 --> 27:23.080
The order applies to high-born and low.

27:23.160 --> 27:24.920
This is the wife of Alfred.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.960
Nonetheless, you agreed we should not risk
the sickness being brought into our town.

27:29.040 --> 27:31.280
The King's mother cannot be treated
the same as a peasant--

27:31.360 --> 27:33.720
She can, if you are to respect the Witan.

27:36.280 --> 27:40.400
She is Mercian in blood and defied me
to send troops to help you.

27:41.280 --> 27:43.280
If she cares for Mercia,
she will turn back.

27:43.360 --> 27:46.480
And trudge the roads like a beggar.
Unthinkable, explain to him!

27:49.640 --> 27:52.000
Lord, if you make an exception
for your mother,

27:52.080 --> 27:54.880
you will be seen
as overruling Mercian wishes.

27:55.640 --> 27:57.840
Tell them to open the gates.

27:58.720 --> 27:59.880
[exasperated breathing]

28:01.000 --> 28:04.880
I cannot speak in the King's name.
That would be to over-reach myself.

28:06.360 --> 28:08.320
The Ealdormen are overruled!

28:09.560 --> 28:11.600
Open the gate immediately!

28:23.120 --> 28:25.640
[crowd shouting]

28:25.720 --> 28:27.320
[horse neighs]

28:27.400 --> 28:29.360
[yelling and shouting]

28:34.640 --> 28:38.200
He lets good Mercians suffer
whilst his own kin are preferred.

28:41.560 --> 28:43.360
I fear you were right, Burgred.

28:45.920 --> 28:47.720
King Edward seeks to conquer us.

28:49.200 --> 28:50.120
Why are you here?

28:51.160 --> 28:53.160
Has something happened in Winchester,
Mother?

28:53.720 --> 28:57.840
Apart from being threatened,
on your behalf, nothing whatsoever.

28:59.880 --> 29:02.000
I sent no command for you
to be imprisoned!

29:02.080 --> 29:03.240
Then how did it happen?

29:03.320 --> 29:05.520
I said you were to be rebuked
for raising the Welsh.

29:05.600 --> 29:09.040
The humiliation of it, Edward,
to be manhandled by your men.

29:09.120 --> 29:11.840
It was not an order I sent!

29:11.920 --> 29:15.360
Who, then?
Who decided to treat me in that way?

29:15.440 --> 29:17.960
I do not know. It is a mistake.

29:18.040 --> 29:21.160
A mistake? Or perhaps the girl lied?

29:21.240 --> 29:25.360
If by the girl you mean the Queen, no.
Aelflaed is a gentle soul--

29:25.440 --> 29:27.200
Lord Aethelhelm, then.

29:27.280 --> 29:29.880
He despises me
and seeks to have me diminished.

29:29.960 --> 29:32.440
He does not speak in my name
without my knowledge.

29:32.520 --> 29:34.320
I think he schemes to his own plan.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.960
Well you, of course, would recognize that.

29:40.040 --> 29:42.040
Enough fighting. Edward.

29:42.880 --> 29:44.840
I simply wish to see Aethelflaed.

29:46.440 --> 29:47.920
She is not here.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.560
She is somewhere in Mercia
with Uhtred Ragnarson.

29:51.200 --> 29:53.200
She travels the road in times of fever?

29:53.280 --> 29:56.880
She has chosen to run with him
and abandon her life as a widow.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.880
Then Uhtred has compelled her.

30:00.240 --> 30:01.520
It appears not.

30:01.600 --> 30:05.040
Then she’s gone mad with grief.
And is this known by the people?

30:05.120 --> 30:07.160
Obviously not. Nor will it be.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.800
But your father will see it.

30:08.880 --> 30:13.720
From above.
Alfred will see it and feel despair.

30:44.680 --> 30:49.080
The lady warrior,
putting her strength to good use, I see.

30:49.880 --> 30:52.080
To think men died to defeat you.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.960
I wouldn’t give you the satisfaction.

30:59.960 --> 31:01.080
You smell of shit.

31:01.720 --> 31:02.560
[spits]

31:56.880 --> 31:57.840
Take some rest.

31:58.760 --> 31:59.920
I will watch over you.

32:01.880 --> 32:04.520
Trust me,
I’ve learned the skills of a warrior.

32:04.600 --> 32:07.320
You may have the skills,
but you do not have the heart of one.

32:07.800 --> 32:10.600
This life isn’t for you.
Why do you pretend like it is?

32:14.280 --> 32:17.440
"Honor your mother and father."
It is commanded.

32:17.520 --> 32:20.520
You do not have to do this
so that father might love you.

32:20.600 --> 32:21.640
I do not.

32:22.120 --> 32:25.160
Besides, I also know how to defend myself.

32:25.720 --> 32:29.120
I’ve spent a lot of time on my own
and taught myself many things.

32:29.720 --> 32:31.960
I’m sorry we were torn from each other.

32:32.240 --> 32:34.240
Alfred used us to hurt Father.

32:35.240 --> 32:38.120
Yes, but at least he led us
to a Christian path.

32:38.680 --> 32:39.960
You perhaps.

32:41.840 --> 32:44.960
-What heathen gave you that?
-None, I made it myself.

32:45.840 --> 32:48.440
As I say, I taught myself many things.

32:49.440 --> 32:52.480
My blood on this rune
is to protect us on our journey.

32:53.920 --> 32:55.040
[blows]

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
[inhales deeply]

33:01.520 --> 33:02.440
[exhales]

33:14.640 --> 33:17.760
They’re traveling with young children.
They cannot be far away.

33:24.040 --> 33:25.440
Aelfwynn says she feels hot.

33:28.360 --> 33:30.160
Drink this. It’ll cool you.

33:35.960 --> 33:37.360
You did not see me do that.

33:37.960 --> 33:39.000
I will not tell.

33:40.160 --> 33:41.600
I think she is just tired.

33:44.120 --> 33:45.800
His name is Finan, isn't it?

33:47.720 --> 33:51.040
That's him. Irish bastard
and the bravest warrior I’ve ever known.

33:52.080 --> 33:53.680
Bar Lord Uhtred himself.

33:53.760 --> 33:57.560
Forgive him for his alarm.
He’s seen the fever take people.

33:57.640 --> 34:00.200
I judge very little,
for I am in no position to.

34:01.080 --> 34:02.120
Thank you, Osferth.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.480
If you feel any worse,
you tell me or Eadith.

34:06.560 --> 34:07.720
I will.

34:11.360 --> 34:13.120
You are true warriors, aren't you?

34:13.199 --> 34:14.040
Mm-hm.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.080
I don’t know about true warriors.

34:17.159 --> 34:19.719
It is strange to spend so much time
with men

34:19.800 --> 34:22.960
and not be seen as a thing to be used.

34:24.400 --> 34:25.239
Oh.

34:25.880 --> 34:28.880
-Well, if you're offended, I can always--
-I am not offended.

34:31.320 --> 34:32.239
[chuckles]

34:32.320 --> 34:34.080
Build the walls of Winchester.

34:38.040 --> 34:39.199
[coughs]

34:40.560 --> 34:42.320
We’ve picked up a trail, Commander.

34:50.360 --> 34:53.920
Try and get some rest now.
We leave before sunrise.

35:09.840 --> 35:11.800
Thank you for not killing my brother.

35:13.280 --> 35:15.400
No honor in killing a sleeping man.

35:18.680 --> 35:20.800
If he comes for us, I will not hesitate.

35:20.880 --> 35:21.720
I know.

35:23.720 --> 35:25.680
I have chosen which bed to lie upon.

35:26.840 --> 35:28.960
Why did you not betray us when you could?

35:29.920 --> 35:32.880
Because I would rather sleep on cold earth
than in a palace

35:32.960 --> 35:34.560
where people see me as a whore.

35:42.360 --> 35:44.480
Do they look down on you from the heavens?

35:46.000 --> 35:46.920
Your gods?

35:48.560 --> 35:50.040
Do they sit in judgement?

35:52.400 --> 35:53.280
No.

35:54.160 --> 35:55.720
They are more fickle than that.

35:56.560 --> 36:01.040
You please them or displease them.
You do not always know how.

36:02.040 --> 36:04.240
So, how do you know
which path is righteous?

36:05.240 --> 36:06.160
Sometimes...

36:08.400 --> 36:11.560
I think the path of the warrior
is my way to Valhalla.

36:16.640 --> 36:18.200
Sometimes I do not know.

36:24.320 --> 36:25.880
Does your god watch over you?

36:30.680 --> 36:32.440
I look for signs that he does.

36:33.560 --> 36:34.720
But I rarely see them.

36:44.280 --> 36:47.800
[raucous shouter and laughter]

36:55.920 --> 36:57.160
[laughs]

37:07.000 --> 37:09.720
Brochfael of Gwent has not smiled once.

37:10.400 --> 37:12.880
Envy. Your victory is his loss, brother.

37:13.440 --> 37:14.360
Hm, perhaps.

37:14.680 --> 37:17.320
Perhaps the spoils
are a little galling to him.

37:21.920 --> 37:22.840
[cheering]

37:28.800 --> 37:30.000
-[Rhodri yells]
-[Brida gasps]

37:31.240 --> 37:32.720
Oh, Rhodri, you are a turd.

37:33.560 --> 37:35.120
She was a great warrior once.

37:35.200 --> 37:37.280
It is you who are the great warrior,
brother.

37:37.360 --> 37:39.480
What will you do now the fight is over?

37:40.280 --> 37:41.720
I’m going on a pilgrimage...

37:42.760 --> 37:45.520
and you can rule
from the fortress in my absence.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.800
Play king for a while.
You deserve it. You fought valiantly.

37:55.400 --> 37:56.360
Come on!

37:56.440 --> 37:57.600
[Brida groans]

38:00.360 --> 38:01.280
[knocking]

38:07.840 --> 38:08.680
This way.

38:21.560 --> 38:24.360
[indistinct chattering]

38:26.880 --> 38:28.040
Come here, bitch!

38:28.120 --> 38:31.200
[pants and groans]

38:34.320 --> 38:37.240
You see this? It belonged to Cnut himself.

38:38.600 --> 38:41.600
No, it did not... you lying turd.

38:41.680 --> 38:45.440
[men raucously] Oh!

38:46.640 --> 38:47.600
[Brida grunts]

38:47.680 --> 38:49.640
Throw the Danish whore in the pit!

38:51.160 --> 38:52.440
[Brida grunts]

38:55.680 --> 38:57.640
[Brida whimpers and yells]

38:57.720 --> 38:58.640
[grunts]

39:01.760 --> 39:03.840
[raucous laughter]

39:06.280 --> 39:08.040
We lost good men because of her.

39:10.440 --> 39:12.560
Have some grace in victory.

39:20.480 --> 39:21.720
We melt this down.

39:22.760 --> 39:25.160
Pay every craftsman in the country
to finish

39:25.240 --> 39:29.280
the job that that bastard King Offa
of Mercia started centuries ago.

39:29.360 --> 39:32.680
A barrier between us and the Saxons!

39:32.760 --> 39:34.240
[cheering]

39:34.320 --> 39:39.400
And, in honor
of our delicious friend here, I swear...

39:39.680 --> 39:45.480
the Saxon pigs will never set another foot
in our beautiful land!

39:45.560 --> 39:49.400
[cheering]

39:49.480 --> 39:50.440
Eat!

39:50.520 --> 39:52.160
[cheering]

40:05.600 --> 40:07.960
[Rhodri] Get up, bitch! [laughs]

40:08.040 --> 40:10.000
-[Brida groans]
-No sleeping down there!

40:10.600 --> 40:11.800
You hungry?

40:11.880 --> 40:13.200
[Rhodri laughs]

40:15.200 --> 40:16.160
Thank you, Father.

40:18.920 --> 40:20.240
[knocking on door]

40:20.880 --> 40:24.280
-[whispers] Go. Hide.
-Come on, quickly.

40:24.360 --> 40:25.400
Get down.

40:29.160 --> 40:30.000
Ah.

40:33.160 --> 40:35.960
Shall I turn a blind eye, Father Pyrlig?

40:38.640 --> 40:41.640
They are just frightened.
None of them have the sickness.

40:41.720 --> 40:44.640
I need to speak with you, in confidence.

40:45.880 --> 40:46.720
Lady, please...

40:48.280 --> 40:51.240
I do not want to be involved
in any more plans to deceive the King.

40:53.960 --> 40:55.120
Except this one.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.120
I am not concerned about Edward.

40:59.600 --> 41:02.240
He seems to have come to his senses,
at last.

41:03.160 --> 41:07.560
But why has my daughter
taken leave of hers?

41:25.440 --> 41:27.800
You imprisoned your own sister?

41:28.440 --> 41:30.600
[sighs]

41:30.680 --> 41:34.480
It was a temporary measure
to keep the town at peace.

41:34.760 --> 41:39.240
And then sent men of violence
to hunt her and Aelfwynn down?

41:39.320 --> 41:40.920
No violence has been ordered.

41:41.400 --> 41:44.440
You send an army, you start a battle.

41:45.560 --> 41:47.600
And now your sister is in harm's way.

41:50.240 --> 41:53.560
-Not to mention your son--
-My son is protected in Winchester.

41:56.880 --> 41:59.240
Your secondborn, yes.

42:01.640 --> 42:04.280
Your firstborn, Aethelstan...

42:05.560 --> 42:07.640
I had hidden at Saltwic.

42:07.720 --> 42:08.560
Mother...

42:09.480 --> 42:10.960
-I sent him there--
-Mother!

42:13.120 --> 42:17.520
I sent him there,
because threats were made against him.

42:17.840 --> 42:20.400
Do you know
if he has been taken by Uhtred?

42:21.080 --> 42:23.480
I believe Uhtred left with children.

42:24.760 --> 42:28.640
So, at best, two of my grandchildren...

42:29.320 --> 42:32.040
travel on open ground in time of sickness.

42:35.080 --> 42:37.720
How has it come to this, Edward?

42:39.440 --> 42:42.600
How have you strayed so far?

42:42.680 --> 42:45.560
Forging an alliance with Mercia
is everything.

42:48.760 --> 42:50.800
I did not intend to harm any child.

42:54.240 --> 42:59.080
But children should not be dragged
into politics, Edward. We know this.

43:00.040 --> 43:01.120
The ones that are...

43:02.360 --> 43:05.280
well, we know they rarely survive.

43:38.480 --> 43:40.280
[chuckles] An actual path.

43:41.440 --> 43:46.120
A good sign. Next village we get to,
we can get some horses, move more quickly.

43:46.200 --> 43:49.400
Without wind, the sickness
cannot have reached this far north.

43:51.160 --> 43:53.160
I fear Lady Aelfwynn may be sickening.

43:54.080 --> 43:55.680
Yes, but we have to keep moving.

43:56.320 --> 43:58.440
-Just reassure her.
-How?

43:59.560 --> 44:00.480
I do not know.

44:02.440 --> 44:04.560
It’s something I myself have failed at.

44:08.440 --> 44:10.280
-[Eadith] Keep going.
-[horse whinnies]

44:10.360 --> 44:11.800
-Not much longer...
-Horses?

44:13.920 --> 44:15.400
Head over that ridge. Go!

44:15.480 --> 44:16.440
[Eadith] Come, Aelfwynn!

44:17.440 --> 44:18.280
[Uhtred] Faster!

44:18.840 --> 44:19.840
-Come, Aelfwynn!
-Quick!

44:21.760 --> 44:23.600
Help the children! Don't look back.

44:23.680 --> 44:25.720
-Keep moving.
-We're not going to outrun them, Father!

44:32.400 --> 44:35.240
[indistinct yelling]

44:36.880 --> 44:38.440
-They’re getting closer!
-Keep moving!

44:38.520 --> 44:40.280
Run! Come on!

44:51.760 --> 44:52.960
[Finan groans]

44:55.560 --> 44:57.440
[Finan] It’s the sickness! Stay back!

44:57.880 --> 44:58.720
Stay back!

45:01.200 --> 45:02.200
Dear God.

45:02.480 --> 45:03.560
We can swim through.

45:04.120 --> 45:06.760
No. I'd rather face them and die now.

45:06.840 --> 45:08.800
I’m not sweating and shitting
in three days’ time.

45:08.880 --> 45:11.440
-I want to try. I am not ready to die.
-No, Stiorra!

45:25.920 --> 45:28.280
Give me Lady Aelfwynn
and you’ll all be spared.

45:28.920 --> 45:30.240
Stay your weapons.

45:30.320 --> 45:31.160
[arrows whistling]

45:32.280 --> 45:34.400
My men won’t miss next time.

45:34.480 --> 45:36.000
[Uhtred] Shield the little ones.

45:41.720 --> 45:43.800
Aelfwynn, come with me.

45:44.760 --> 45:46.520
Or I will kill all of these people.

45:46.600 --> 45:48.520
Then I’ll find your mother
and I’ll kill her too.

45:50.120 --> 45:52.080
Save your friends and leave with me.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.440
[Uhtred] She will stay where she is.

45:56.040 --> 45:58.040
-[Eardwulf] Aelfwynn, we are betrothed.
-[sobs]

46:02.800 --> 46:03.760
[Uhtred] Stand firm.

46:05.280 --> 46:07.360
Protect the children with your lives.

46:08.640 --> 46:12.120
When the fighting kicks off,
run like hell toward the trees, wee man.

46:12.400 --> 46:13.400
[dagger rasps]

46:14.640 --> 46:15.480
I want it back.

46:22.040 --> 46:24.240
-Are you ready, Sister Warrior?
-She's ready.

46:24.320 --> 46:25.400
[Stiorra pants]

46:27.920 --> 46:32.160
[sobs and whimpers]
Please don’t let them kill my mother!

46:37.920 --> 46:39.320
[Eardwulf] Seize the child!

46:53.720 --> 46:56.080
No. No, do not do his bidding!

46:56.160 --> 46:57.600
He has betrayed you all!

46:58.360 --> 47:00.720
He murdered Lord Aethelred!
I witnessed it--

47:00.800 --> 47:02.200
So speaks a traitor of Mercia--

47:02.280 --> 47:04.120
As he lay mortally wounded in his bed--

47:04.200 --> 47:07.360
-This is the words of a whore!
-I will swear to it on the book!

47:09.400 --> 47:13.000
Aethelred refused to allow my brother
to marry this poor child.

47:13.720 --> 47:15.040
So, he killed him.

47:15.920 --> 47:17.240
That is the man you serve.

47:17.920 --> 47:21.080
Ask him why Aethelred was late
to the fight at Tettenhall?

47:21.520 --> 47:24.000
Because this man lied to you!

47:24.080 --> 47:28.000
Days he delayed telling you
your fellow Mercians were dead!

47:28.080 --> 47:32.040
Days you could have had to travel home
and save your families!

47:32.120 --> 47:34.320
He killed and buried the messenger

47:34.400 --> 47:37.000
that Edward sent
alerting us to the trouble.

47:37.080 --> 47:39.640
My men will not be fooled by your lies.

47:39.720 --> 47:40.880
[guard] Let the woman speak!

47:45.960 --> 47:47.560
I have proof of his crime!

47:48.400 --> 47:51.200
Look inside the pouch
he wears around his neck!

47:51.840 --> 47:57.160
Inside, you will find the ring that
he stole from your Lord as he lay dead.

47:57.680 --> 47:58.800
There is no truth to this.

47:58.880 --> 48:01.000
If there is no truth to it, then prove it.

48:02.200 --> 48:03.840
Show your men what’s inside.

48:05.600 --> 48:08.760
Seize Aelfwynn
or I will have you executed for treachery.

48:11.200 --> 48:12.400
Do as I say!

48:13.400 --> 48:14.920
Do not threaten your own men!

48:16.760 --> 48:17.720
Enough talk.

48:18.480 --> 48:19.480
If she lies...

48:20.240 --> 48:22.520
let us see what you bear around your neck.

48:23.560 --> 48:24.480
Now.

48:42.440 --> 48:45.360
It is Lord Aethelred's. It has his seal!

48:53.200 --> 48:58.520
You cannot deny it.
Save yourself before these men kill you.

48:58.840 --> 49:00.800
Flee to Frankia, brother!

49:06.600 --> 49:07.440
You’re safe now.

49:27.480 --> 49:28.800
Will he return?

49:29.320 --> 49:31.320
I doubt I will see him alive again.

49:33.320 --> 49:34.600
It is over for us.

50:08.480 --> 50:09.400
[messenger groans]

50:15.120 --> 50:16.200
[chains clanging]

50:19.960 --> 50:21.200
[whimpering]

50:24.080 --> 50:25.160
Who did this to you?

50:26.480 --> 50:27.320
Danes.

50:28.320 --> 50:32.800
[breathes heavily] They have landed
west of here... from Irland.

50:34.480 --> 50:37.480
They told me to say
they are intent on slaughter.

50:38.320 --> 50:40.960
And that yours
is the first head they will take.

50:48.200 --> 50:50.000
There will be plenty of time
for reading books

50:50.080 --> 50:52.520
and playing games
before you'll be needing one of these.

50:57.080 --> 50:57.960
Aethelstan?

51:00.480 --> 51:01.600
You ride with Finan.

51:01.680 --> 51:03.120
Keep an eye on him? Hm?

51:04.920 --> 51:06.680
You two go on the road
and find Aethelflaed.

51:06.760 --> 51:08.640
Tell her her child is safe for now.

51:08.720 --> 51:10.640
Eadith and Osferth will guard her here

51:10.720 --> 51:12.720
until Edward has sworn
he will not harm her.

51:12.800 --> 51:15.160
You will tell him
what kind of a man he trusted.

51:16.040 --> 51:19.320
So, we fight for peace, Lord... again.

51:19.720 --> 51:21.520
We cannot let them turn on each other.

51:24.320 --> 51:25.240
We do it?

51:27.840 --> 51:28.720
We do it.

51:48.600 --> 51:50.040
I fear she’s getting worse.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.200
Can you keep her alive until I return?

51:54.720 --> 51:56.680
We will do everything we can.

52:03.320 --> 52:04.200
We need to.

52:06.360 --> 52:07.840
She is the future.
