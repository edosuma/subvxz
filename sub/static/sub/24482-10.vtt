WEBVTT

01:15.283 --> 01:18.244
<i>This is Will Robinson</i>
<i>of the 24th Colonist Group.</i>

01:18.912 --> 01:22.040
<i>I'm making a record of this</i>
<i>because it seems...</i>

01:23.416 --> 01:28.713
<i>I'm the first human to discover evidence</i>
<i>of an alien intelligence.</i>

01:30.965 --> 01:32.967
<i>This appears to be</i>
<i>the first known work of art</i>

01:33.051 --> 01:35.804
<i>of an artificial intelligence</i>
<i>of alien origin.</i>

01:38.097 --> 01:40.600
<i>What would you like to call</i>
<i>your masterpiece?</i>

01:40.683 --> 01:41.518
<i>Danger.</i>

01:44.771 --> 01:46.314
<i> Let's try something else.</i>

02:37.073 --> 02:39.742
That's the low oxygen warning.
Yeah.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.497
So we've only got
two hours of air left.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.333
That's right.

02:48.626 --> 02:49.586
Great.

02:53.715 --> 02:56.342
How'd we all get caught up in the idea
that launching into space like the most primitive astronauts
in history was somehow genius?

02:59.137 --> 03:01.848
-If only you'd gone left.

03:01.931 --> 03:04.976
Look, Maureen didn't answer,
which isn't like her.

03:05.059 --> 03:10.398
Left or right. It's a 50/50 shot.
In my world, those are great odds.

03:10.481 --> 03:13.193
A 50% chance of dying are terrible odds.

03:13.568 --> 03:16.070
You never eject a man into outer space
without his permission.

03:16.154 --> 03:17.780
It's common courtesy.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.329
Hey. We still have a couple of hours.

03:26.581 --> 03:28.583
We had a 50/50 shot.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.296
<i> Hey, we got work to do.</i>
<i>Pick it up.</i>

03:33.880 --> 03:36.799
Ready? One, two, three.

03:48.353 --> 03:51.564
-The tremors are getting worse.
-Yeah.

04:01.532 --> 04:02.700
That's all of them.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.286
Almost all of them.

04:05.370 --> 04:08.831
Hiroki's gonna be pretty upset
when he figures out we snuck off his ship.

04:09.832 --> 04:12.669
Well, Robinsons stick together.

04:17.006 --> 04:19.467
Once Mom and Judy get back,
we'll be all set to go? They haven't called in a while.
They should be back by now.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.476
Is that Dad back in range?

04:28.559 --> 04:30.061
Yeah.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.904
-It's Morse code.

04:40.571 --> 04:42.198
-F.
-Okay.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.952
-U.

04:46.369 --> 04:49.539
That's his message
This is how your kids talk?

04:49.622 --> 04:50.456
E.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.208
Okay, that changes everything.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.168
L.

04:54.627 --> 04:58.256
-Hey, they got fuel!

04:58.339 --> 04:59.173
Yeah.

04:59.924 --> 05:00.842
Yeah.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.761
If we'd waited a couple of hours,
we wouldn't be here.

05:05.930 --> 05:06.764
Great.

05:09.726 --> 05:10.935
Do you hear that?

05:21.279 --> 05:23.531
-Mom, Judy, I have amazing news.
-No, it can wait.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.953
-Stay calm.
What is she doing here?

05:29.037 --> 05:31.497
I live here, in case you've forgotten.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.249
Yeah. There's four of us and one of you.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.793
Actually, there's two of me.

05:36.961 --> 05:38.963
You're alive.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.800
I want you to restrain Dr. Smith.

05:43.468 --> 05:44.427
Will, he's not the same.

05:45.678 --> 05:46.763
Robot, come here.

05:49.682 --> 05:51.559
Stop! I said stop.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.315
Will, are you okay?

06:00.735 --> 06:01.986
It's hers now.

06:06.115 --> 06:09.827
I saved him this time
from what you did to him.

06:10.411 --> 06:12.455
Friends don't make friends
walk off cliffs.

06:12.538 --> 06:16.000
-Leave him alone.

06:16.959 --> 06:19.212
That's how we've always been
with each other.

06:19.295 --> 06:21.798
So what now

06:21.881 --> 06:25.051
What we all want.
To fly up to the<i> Resolute.</i>

06:25.385 --> 06:28.012
I'm not holding any grudges.
And you shouldn't either.

06:32.433 --> 06:33.601
What is that annoying noise?

06:34.018 --> 06:35.937
-Will, is it...
-Yeah.

06:36.020 --> 06:38.147
-Yeah.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.107
Think what is?

06:39.690 --> 06:42.985
It's Dad. He's okay.
He and Don are up there in orbit.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.448
That's such great news.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.624
My Morse code's a little rusty.
What's he saying?

06:57.542 --> 07:00.586
M-U...

07:01.462 --> 07:03.422
G-U.

07:03.798 --> 07:04.924
"Mugu."

07:05.508 --> 07:09.929
-Point Mugu. It's a state park.
-I used to love that place.

07:10.012 --> 07:11.264
But why is he talking about it?

07:11.347 --> 07:13.099
It's a message.
He's trying to tell us something.

07:13.182 --> 07:15.810
What do you guys remember most
about going there?

07:15.893 --> 07:17.979
Uh, we used to build bonfires
on the beach.

07:18.062 --> 07:19.981
-Yeah, I remember that.
-Okay, bonfire.

07:20.064 --> 07:23.317
Why would that have
anything to do with anything?

07:24.735 --> 07:26.362
Could he build one up in space?

07:27.989 --> 07:29.449
Yes, I think so.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.869
He's trying to tell us where he is.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.413
Let's search the atmosphere
for a heat signature.

07:35.997 --> 07:39.417
Wait. We had a plan.

07:40.418 --> 07:43.921
-Same plan, slight detour.
-I've had enough detours in my life.

07:48.134 --> 07:52.096
You said that you didn't want
to hurt John. Was that true?

07:55.516 --> 07:56.684
Be honest.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.564
How long before the<i> Resolute</i>
leaves for good?

08:05.026 --> 08:05.860
88 minutes.

08:28.966 --> 08:31.844
So exactly what is the plan
to make this signal fire?

08:32.178 --> 08:34.472
Still got some fuel oxidizer in the lines.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.850
I can rig it to blow a stream
of burning gas.

08:37.934 --> 08:40.770
You think it'll be enough for
the <i>Jupiter's</i> thermal sensors to pick up?

08:41.437 --> 08:43.189
Ow! Ow!

08:43.272 --> 08:44.732
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:48.361 --> 08:50.446
There's something in my eyes.
Stings like hell.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.656
Okay, let me see.

08:53.658 --> 08:56.661
Oh, yeah. Some of the anti-fogging agent
must have dried up and flaked off.

08:56.744 --> 08:59.997
Yeah, well, I can't see.
I'll just have to feel around and wing it.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.668
Whoa!

09:04.752 --> 09:08.256
Hey, you can't do this blind.

09:08.339 --> 09:10.424
-Yeah.

09:10.925 --> 09:14.929
I assume you're comfortable identifying
compression-loaded orthogrid cylinders.

09:15.012 --> 09:17.390
Just gonna have to talk me through it.
Okay?

09:18.683 --> 09:19.850
How hard can it be?

09:20.560 --> 09:24.230
There are four hexagonal bolts.
Start unscrewing.

09:24.438 --> 09:26.107
You do know what a hexagon is?

09:29.068 --> 09:32.196
<i>Launch will commence</i>
<i>in T-minus ten minutes.</i>

09:49.380 --> 09:50.256
Hi.

09:55.886 --> 09:56.721
It's okay.

10:02.643 --> 10:03.936
Remember this?

10:33.215 --> 10:34.383
Hey.

10:37.928 --> 10:40.514
You and me are still friends.

10:42.224 --> 10:44.435
So that means you and the robot
can still be friends.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.691
It's not my friend.

11:03.454 --> 11:04.955
You said "it," not "he."

11:06.540 --> 11:07.917
I guess I did.

11:09.293 --> 11:14.465
We're gonna fix him, okay?
We'll get him back to the way he was.

11:16.592 --> 11:18.302
It's not coming back.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.441
Pop-outs secured.

11:34.276 --> 11:36.070
Smith really gonna let us
rescue Dad and Don?

11:37.071 --> 11:40.032
-She hasn't said no yet.
-I wish we could leave her here.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.785
<i> Launch will commence</i>
<i>in T-minus seven minutes.</i>

11:42.868 --> 11:47.081
Be thankful she's not leaving us.
Be thankful she can't pilot the ship.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.460
Can we really let Smith bring that robot
to the<i> Resolute?</i>

11:51.544 --> 11:54.296
With all those people there?
Who knows what she's gonna do.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.715
We'll deal with one problem at a time.

12:03.431 --> 12:06.308
Volcano

12:06.392 --> 12:09.395
It was always there.
It was just disguised as a mountain.

12:10.062 --> 12:12.189
-Strap in now.
Will.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.075
<i>The volcano's gonna create</i>
<i>significant top winds.</i>

12:23.534 --> 12:24.869
Liftoff's gonna get pretty bumpy.

12:25.744 --> 12:26.787
How bumpy?

12:28.873 --> 12:32.293
The hub is the safest place on the ship.
You're free to stay here...

12:33.502 --> 12:35.963
or you can ride up front with me.
Your choice.

12:41.218 --> 12:42.303
I go where you go.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.556
Not that I don't trust you.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.398
Okay, helmets on.

13:02.907 --> 13:06.076
<i>Launch will commence</i>
<i>in T-minus two minutes.</i>

13:11.957 --> 13:14.543
Excuse me,
I need to perform pre-launch checks.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.128
It's okay.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.719
I usually have a co-pilot.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.014
You seem to be doing fine on your own.

13:28.557 --> 13:30.100
But then, you've had years of practice

13:30.184 --> 13:32.561
of having to do everything
all by yourself.

13:33.395 --> 13:36.232
Are you sure we need to go out of our way
to pick up your husband?

13:37.775 --> 13:40.569
Do you ever feel guilty
about anything you do?

13:40.653 --> 13:43.072
<i>Launch will commence</i>
<i>in T-minus one minute.</i>

13:43.155 --> 13:45.616
Guilt is like a stomachache
from overeating.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.662
You make all sorts of promises
while you're feeling it,

13:50.120 --> 13:52.706
but once it passes,
you just get hungry again.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.250
Most people are not like you.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.711
Everybody's like me.
I'm just not in denial.

13:58.295 --> 13:59.922
Denial about what?

14:00.005 --> 14:02.591
-I just wanna look out for myself.

14:03.217 --> 14:07.221
You think you're so different?
You love John because he protects you.

14:07.721 --> 14:10.516
You fight for your kids
because it gives you purpose.

14:10.599 --> 14:12.393
Even Will, all that sweetness...

14:13.644 --> 14:16.230
it's only because he's scared
and he wants to feel safe.

14:16.313 --> 14:18.232
Don't you dare talk to me about my son.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.734
<i>Launch will commence</i>
<i>in T-minus 30 seconds.</i>

14:20.818 --> 14:23.445
He's a perfectly fine kid,
but he's no angel.

14:24.154 --> 14:26.824
He's not selfless. Nobody is.

14:35.749 --> 14:39.795
<i>Launch will commence</i>
<i>in T-minus ten, nine,</i>

14:39.879 --> 14:43.465
<i>eight, seven, six, five...</i>

14:43.549 --> 14:46.010
I'm not gonna miss this place.
<i>-...four, three,</i>

14:46.093 --> 14:48.262
<i>-two, one.</i>
-Well, we've got that in common.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.461
Okay, planet that we never
bothered to name,

15:20.878 --> 15:22.796
this is between us now.

15:25.966 --> 15:27.676
We're leaving.

15:46.987 --> 15:49.990
Judy, Penny, Will, we're clear.

15:52.993 --> 15:54.328
It's pretty up here.

15:56.246 --> 15:58.624
But I guess everything looks pretty
from far enough away.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.974
-Yes.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.434
<i>Mom, things just got weird.</i>

16:21.730 --> 16:22.690
Are we in orbit?

16:24.316 --> 16:25.359
Yes, we are.

16:27.778 --> 16:30.614
And no, I don't know why
there's gravity on the ship.

16:45.212 --> 16:48.590
Jupiter 2,<i> this is</i>
<i>Victor Dhar calling you from the</i> Resolute.

16:49.299 --> 16:52.428
<i>I repeat. </i>Jupiter 2,<i> this is Victor Dhar</i>
<i>calling you from the </i>Resolute.

16:56.557 --> 16:57.891
<i>I don't know if you can hear us,</i>

16:57.975 --> 17:00.811
but every one of the other Jupiters
made it here safely.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.564
<i>And for that,</i>
<i>we owe you a debt of gratitude.</i>

17:05.858 --> 17:08.402
However, as you're well aware,
there's a black hole

17:08.485 --> 17:10.446
making this section of space
extremely treacherous.

17:11.572 --> 17:15.409
<i>You now have 63 minutes to join us.</i>

17:17.828 --> 17:19.121
I hope you will.

17:19.496 --> 17:22.124
<i>Because after that time,</i>
<i>we simply can't wait any longer.</i>

17:24.293 --> 17:25.627
<i>Resolute,</i> out.

17:27.004 --> 17:28.464
63 minutes?

17:29.798 --> 17:33.761
-That's plenty of time to get John.
-Oh, yeah, that's right.

17:33.844 --> 17:39.099
I'll program in a search pattern now.

17:39.183 --> 17:42.352
<i>Course correction</i>
<i>required. Insufficient fuel.</i>

17:42.436 --> 17:43.896
"Insufficient fuel"?

17:44.605 --> 17:48.067
Don't pay any attention to that.
The system isn't properly calibrated.

17:48.650 --> 17:51.612
Because it sounds a lot like
we won't have enough fuel

17:51.695 --> 17:54.740
to go find your husband
and still make it back to the<i> Resolute.</i>

17:54.823 --> 17:57.993
-I'll tighten the search perimeters.
-That's insufficient.

17:59.036 --> 18:01.371
It's time for you to put aside
your personal feelings

18:01.705 --> 18:04.374
-and get your priorities straight.

18:06.001 --> 18:07.669
Sometimes you have to let people go.

18:10.297 --> 18:12.091
Set a course for the<i> Resolute.</i>

18:13.509 --> 18:14.426
No.

18:16.887 --> 18:18.138
Set a course for the<i> Resolute</i>

18:18.222 --> 18:20.265
and you and your kids
can go there with me.

18:22.518 --> 18:25.938
Or I'll throw you off the ship
and find a way to get there myself.

18:27.356 --> 18:30.818
-I know I do.

18:30.901 --> 18:33.112
-I have a robot.

18:34.655 --> 18:35.489
Ahhh!

18:37.908 --> 18:41.203
<i>Warning.</i>
<i>Entry angle exceeding parameters.</i>

18:41.286 --> 18:43.038
-Trust her.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.998
<i>Five hundred.</i>
<i>Approaching minimums.</i>

18:45.082 --> 18:48.001
Are you crazy? You'd commit suicide
with your kids?

18:48.085 --> 18:49.753
<i>Four hundred.</i>
<i>Approaching minimums.</i>

18:49.837 --> 18:53.549
We're Robinsons.
Live together or die together.
Danger, Dr. Smith.

18:57.427 --> 18:59.805
Danger, Dr. Smith.

18:59.888 --> 19:01.098
She's bluffing.

19:02.599 --> 19:04.643
<i>Out of the hub, now.</i>
<i>One hundred.</i>
<i>Approaching minimums.</i>

19:06.854 --> 19:08.897
Danger, Dr. Smith.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.066
Stop it.

19:12.317 --> 19:15.070
<i>Minimums. Minimums. Minimums.</i>

19:15.404 --> 19:16.530
This is what she wants.

19:16.613 --> 19:18.365
<i>Pull up. Pull up. Pull up.</i>

19:18.448 --> 19:19.783
Come on.

19:19.867 --> 19:26.582
<i>Pull up. Pull up.</i>
<i>Pull up. Pull up. Pull up.</i>

19:27.332 --> 19:28.834
<i>Orbit stabilized.</i>

19:48.812 --> 19:52.274
Open the door! Get me out of here!

20:09.499 --> 20:11.460
You're in the safest room on the ship.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.171
It was designed to survive
an asteroid collision.

20:14.504 --> 20:16.548
It was designed to withstand solar flares.

20:16.632 --> 20:20.385
It was designed to repel temperatures
that drop to absolute zero.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.846
And do you know who designed it? Me.

20:23.305 --> 20:25.265
So don't expect to get out any time soon.

20:35.651 --> 20:36.485
Break the glass.

20:44.785 --> 20:47.663
-You can't keep me in here forever.
-That's true.

20:47.996 --> 20:49.665
But you'll be in there for long enough.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.876
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to find my husband. You do realize you can never
criticize us for being reckless again.

21:02.386 --> 21:05.347
Of course I can. I'm your mother.
You and Judy get the harpoon ready.

21:05.430 --> 21:08.725
Wait, we have a harpoon?
Will, you're with me.

21:11.061 --> 21:13.730
We're almost there.
Find the green wire?

21:13.814 --> 21:17.150
-There is no green wire.
-Okay, find the black wire.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.028
-There's no black wire.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.572
Whole bunch of wires,
none of which are green or black.

21:22.656 --> 21:24.992
Whoever installed this
must've swapped out this unit

21:25.075 --> 21:27.953
with another controller to cut corners.
It was probably that Williamson,

21:28.036 --> 21:30.122
-that cheap son of a bitch.

21:30.205 --> 21:33.125
There are a thousand possible scenarios
to choose from,

21:33.208 --> 21:36.962
only one of which would work.
I'd know if I saw it.

21:37.045 --> 21:41.508
Okay. Okay.
You're just gonna have to see it.

21:42.551 --> 21:46.013
As it happens, our eyes have the ability
to generate liquid. They're called tears.

21:46.096 --> 21:47.889
-Yeah.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.141
Well, how?

21:50.600 --> 21:55.272
Well, I don't know, I mean, I...
Think of something sad.

21:55.355 --> 21:58.191
-That seems to work for most people.
-I can't cry out of nowhere.

22:00.068 --> 22:01.445
Okay, okay.

22:01.528 --> 22:04.448
Picture all your family and friends
that you left behind on Earth

22:04.531 --> 22:06.199
that you may never see again.

22:06.283 --> 22:09.244
There's no one I really care about.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have left.

22:09.328 --> 22:12.456
I've been on my own ever since
before I could tie my shoelaces.

22:12.539 --> 22:13.832
Which I taught myself.

22:15.667 --> 22:16.752
I've seen a lot of orphans.

22:16.835 --> 22:20.464
Who says I'm an orphan?
My parents are alive and well.

22:21.048 --> 22:22.341
Somewhere, I guess.

22:23.675 --> 22:25.093
I'm sorry they ditched you.

22:25.844 --> 22:28.555
Must be tough knowing
that they never loved you.

22:30.182 --> 22:33.268
That they thought
you were a worthless piece of--

22:33.352 --> 22:36.688
Hey, what the hell, man? Why do you--
Oh, I see what you're doing.

22:37.105 --> 22:39.399
Trying to make me cry.
You have to do better than that.

22:39.483 --> 22:44.404
You know what? Forget about it.
I'll figure it out myself.

22:50.410 --> 22:52.913
We actually have a harpoon gun.

22:52.996 --> 22:56.416
All my life, I feel like I've been
missing out on harpooning things.

22:57.250 --> 22:59.753
All this talk of harpooning
reminds me,

22:59.836 --> 23:01.755
we never got to finish <i>Moby-Dick.</i>

23:01.838 --> 23:04.091
-Only got to, like, page 30.
-The whale kills Ahab.

23:04.800 --> 23:05.842
Spoiler alert.

23:06.176 --> 23:09.971
It was written in 1851. You had your shot.

23:12.557 --> 23:15.227
Diving towards the planet
must have used a lot of fuel.

23:15.310 --> 23:17.020
Do we still have enough to find Dad?

23:17.646 --> 23:19.523
I'm starting another infrared sweep.

23:21.358 --> 23:23.777
If he can get that bonfire lit soon,
we should be okay.

23:31.159 --> 23:35.831
I never should have saved him.
Should have let him die in that tree.

23:39.292 --> 23:43.713
The robot is only as good as its master.
You are a very good person.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.301
The robot saved Judy because of you.

23:50.137 --> 23:52.139
-That's right.

23:52.222 --> 23:54.683
Judy was trapped in the ice because of me.

23:55.809 --> 23:56.893
No one blames you for that.

23:56.977 --> 23:58.478
I should have been able to swim down.

23:58.562 --> 24:00.480
If I would've swam down
and gotten the battery,

24:00.564 --> 24:01.898
everything would have been fine.

24:01.982 --> 24:02.941
Enough.

24:03.275 --> 24:07.028
We have plenty of problems to solve now
without rehashing the past.

24:29.759 --> 24:32.554
The stress test to get accepted
into the colony program.

24:34.222 --> 24:35.640
I didn't pass.

24:39.853 --> 24:40.770
No, you didn't.

24:42.022 --> 24:43.148
Then how am I here?

24:45.692 --> 24:47.652
You deserve to be at the colony.

24:47.736 --> 24:50.280
There's no test
that could convince me otherwise.

24:50.363 --> 24:51.573
But how am I here?

24:54.201 --> 24:55.952
I pulled some strings.

24:58.330 --> 25:01.374
-You did something wrong.
-No, not wrong.

25:03.126 --> 25:06.046
Illegal. There's a big difference.

25:07.130 --> 25:09.591
You would have been better off
if I'd stayed behind.

25:20.602 --> 25:23.480
Can't you hit it any harder?

25:27.525 --> 25:29.736
I know you, Maureen.

25:29.819 --> 25:33.323
You didn't design this as a cage.

25:33.782 --> 25:36.701
You designed this
to protect your children.

25:36.785 --> 25:43.166
Yes. You would absolutely have built in
a way for them to get out.

25:45.418 --> 25:49.381
"Jupiter Class Interplanetary Craft Manual
of Operations."

25:49.798 --> 25:52.884
I may have skipped orientation,
but I am a quick learner.

25:56.429 --> 25:57.931
If you make yourself throw up,

25:58.014 --> 26:00.350
you're gonna have a bigger problem
than blindness.

26:02.811 --> 26:03.979
It's not working anyway.

26:06.147 --> 26:09.985
So let me guess, we're down to what?
One hour of air?

26:10.068 --> 26:13.571
There's not enough time for me
to try every combination of wires.

26:13.655 --> 26:14.990
I need your eyes, Don.

26:16.658 --> 26:20.245
Hey, seriously though,

26:21.413 --> 26:24.124
the thought of dying
doesn't make you feel sad?

26:24.207 --> 26:25.959
Don't you have any regrets?

26:26.042 --> 26:28.878
I don't believe in looking back.
That's how you crash into things.

26:30.797 --> 26:35.927
There was a time all I ever thought about
was the things I never did.

26:37.971 --> 26:42.517
Birthday card I forgot to mail.
Birthday card I forgot to buy.

26:44.019 --> 26:49.733
Birthdays... just came and went.

26:53.611 --> 26:57.157
But then, I came to realize

26:57.240 --> 27:01.995
it was all the days in between
I was really missing out on.

27:02.078 --> 27:06.458
Breakfast before school,
driving carpool to soccer practice,

27:07.125 --> 27:11.212
skinned knees that I was never there
to put Band-Aids on...

27:11.963 --> 27:16.676
Regular days.
Yeah, that's what really mattered.

27:19.554 --> 27:23.475
I had three great kids
that I thought I'd lost forever.

27:23.558 --> 27:27.729
But you know, crashing on this planet
is the best thing that ever happened to me

27:27.812 --> 27:30.148
because it helped me find them again.

27:33.485 --> 27:37.822
I love Penny 'cause she gives me lip.

27:38.114 --> 27:41.993
But she tries harder
than anyone will ever give her credit for.

27:42.577 --> 27:47.374
I love Will 'cause
he sees things that I can't see.

27:47.457 --> 27:49.334
Anyway, he's smarter than I am.

27:50.377 --> 27:54.547
I love Judy 'cause even though
I'm not her biological dad,

27:55.173 --> 27:57.092
she's exactly like me.

27:57.175 --> 28:00.762
I mean, she's strong, fearless.

28:02.305 --> 28:05.475
Ah. Maybe I just wish I was more like her.

28:10.563 --> 28:11.648
Hey.

28:14.317 --> 28:16.236
I wish I'd had a father like you.

28:20.115 --> 28:23.118
Why don't you quit blubbering
and get our signal fire lit, huh?

28:26.996 --> 28:29.624
-Yeah, sorry about that.

28:30.709 --> 28:31.835
Give me a minute.

28:36.631 --> 28:40.093
-Hang on to something.
Why?

28:41.344 --> 28:42.679
We might blow up.

28:44.097 --> 28:45.181
Whoa!

28:46.558 --> 28:48.017
I'm picking up something hot.

28:48.476 --> 28:51.312
<i></i>
-Ready.

29:15.962 --> 29:17.464
I see them!

29:19.048 --> 29:21.843
Hey. Nice hydrazine fire you've got there.

29:21.926 --> 29:24.345
Hey! I knew you'd find us.

29:24.429 --> 29:25.638
It was a group effort.

29:25.722 --> 29:27.182
<i>Say hi to the group.</i>

29:27.265 --> 29:28.349
Hi, there.

29:29.768 --> 29:30.935
-Dad.

29:31.019 --> 29:32.854
-Hey, Dad.
<i>Dad. Hi, Dad!</i>

29:32.937 --> 29:35.064
You're not allowed to
do that to us again, okay?

29:35.982 --> 29:37.484
I knew you'd be fine.

29:38.276 --> 29:39.527
Um...

29:39.611 --> 29:41.404
Hey, everybody.

29:41.488 --> 29:45.784
-No. Maybe. I mean--

29:45.867 --> 29:47.243
-Tears of joy.
Yeah.

29:47.827 --> 29:48.828
So what happened?

29:48.912 --> 29:51.039
Where to begin?

29:51.873 --> 29:53.750
Let's just get you out of the cold.

30:03.384 --> 30:05.887
-Almost in range.

30:05.970 --> 30:08.389
<i>Target in range in 30 seconds.</i>

30:09.390 --> 30:10.225
Listen.

30:12.685 --> 30:14.354
When did the pounding stop?

30:15.855 --> 30:17.065
<i>Target in range</i>

30:17.148 --> 30:18.483
<i>-in 20 seconds.</i>
-Come on, come on.

30:30.411 --> 30:32.705
<i>Eight, seven, six...</i>

30:34.749 --> 30:36.835
-<i>Target out of range.</i>
-We gotta run.

30:45.051 --> 30:46.302
It doesn't reach.

30:46.761 --> 30:49.806
Hey, Maureen! Maureen!

30:50.682 --> 30:53.810
You stabbed me in the back, Maureen.

30:57.438 --> 30:58.815
Our fuel's gone.

31:00.733 --> 31:02.193
The <i>Resolute's</i> gone.

31:06.155 --> 31:09.075
I'm stuck here,
drifting nowhere till I die.

31:10.910 --> 31:13.788
<i>Hey, Maureen!</i>
<i>You missed.</i>

31:15.832 --> 31:17.458
And all because of you.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.260
You and your family.

31:49.282 --> 31:50.617
Come on.

32:04.797 --> 32:06.090
Hurry.
Hey.

32:06.174 --> 32:07.675
What happened?
-Get in the Chariot.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.677
What do you mean

32:09.761 --> 32:11.220
-It got out.
What?

32:13.765 --> 32:15.475
-Get in now.

32:17.602 --> 32:20.563
Seal the doors.
It'll maintain pressure long enough.

32:20.647 --> 32:23.024
-Mom, we can help you.
-Stay in there!

32:27.362 --> 32:28.613
Hey, where's Will?

32:38.039 --> 32:42.418
No, get out of there! No! Will! Hide!

32:43.127 --> 32:47.715
You know who I am. It's me.

32:50.969 --> 32:53.638
-It's Will Robinson.
What do we do?

32:59.602 --> 33:01.062
And we're friends.

33:10.613 --> 33:12.031
No!

33:19.372 --> 33:21.124
Get away from my kids!

33:23.835 --> 33:26.963
Go! Tie yourself onto there.

33:33.052 --> 33:35.471
-Yeah.

33:54.407 --> 33:56.367
No! No! No!

34:14.427 --> 34:16.554
<i>Air pressure stabilized.</i>

34:23.644 --> 34:24.854
Maybe I can jump for it.

34:25.688 --> 34:27.940
No, wait! Look.

34:40.203 --> 34:42.121
What the hell is that?

34:49.337 --> 34:51.339
-Yeah.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.174
Yeah. Yeah, Mom. They held.

35:09.732 --> 35:11.025
What is that?

35:33.714 --> 35:34.632
Judy!

35:50.064 --> 35:52.984
-Go!

35:53.985 --> 35:55.736
You stay away from them!

36:00.324 --> 36:01.951
Mom!
-Mom!

37:21.614 --> 37:23.157
I knew it was still you.

37:23.866 --> 37:26.285
Friends, Will Robinson.

37:26.869 --> 37:30.456
Yeah. Yeah, friends.

38:31.934 --> 38:34.645
<i>Ship's oxygen loss</i>
<i>will reach critical levels</i>

38:34.729 --> 38:36.647
<i>-in T-minus two minutes.</i>
-Mom.

38:36.731 --> 38:39.900
-Yeah, I will be.

38:45.865 --> 38:47.366
Mom, Will!

38:48.367 --> 38:50.619
There's a crack in the glass.
We're losing air.

38:51.412 --> 38:53.706
-It's not gonna hold.

38:53.789 --> 38:58.586
The ramp won't close.
The hydraulics are damaged.

38:59.754 --> 39:01.088
Okay.

39:01.672 --> 39:03.341
There's a manual crank outside.

39:05.551 --> 39:06.552
Will, you can't.

39:08.179 --> 39:11.515
-I have to.
-Will, you can't!

39:14.435 --> 39:17.271
What good is protecting me my whole life

39:19.231 --> 39:21.567
if I can't grow up to protect you?

39:29.033 --> 39:30.409
You be careful.

40:38.519 --> 40:41.397
Once I shut the door,
I'll climb over to the rear airlock.

40:41.480 --> 40:43.482
That's a long climb.

40:44.942 --> 40:45.901
He knows. It's gonna work.

41:10.759 --> 41:12.636
<i>Oxygen loss evaded.</i>

41:13.095 --> 41:13.929
You did it.

41:16.724 --> 41:19.852
I did do it, didn't I?

41:22.104 --> 41:24.398
<i>I'll be waiting for you at the hatch.</i>

41:52.801 --> 41:53.761
Ah!

41:55.387 --> 41:57.306
No! No!

41:58.599 --> 42:00.726
<i>Will, are you okay?</i>

42:05.231 --> 42:08.901
<i>Will?</i>

42:20.162 --> 42:25.125
-Dad!
-I gotcha. I gotcha, buddy.

42:27.628 --> 42:29.255
Come on. Let's go home.

42:42.184 --> 42:43.727
I think it's kind of cool.

42:45.187 --> 42:48.315
I have a scar too, buddy.
Wraps all the way from my waist--

42:48.399 --> 42:50.234
-All right. No. Uh-uh.
-No!

42:51.151 --> 42:52.361
Seventeen stitches.

42:52.778 --> 42:54.363
Used my best bottle of whiskey
to clean it up.

42:54.446 --> 42:56.615
-I was passed out.
Story time is over now.

42:56.699 --> 42:58.284
Blood everywhere. No, listen to me.

43:14.008 --> 43:15.509
There's no sign of the<i> Resolute.</i>

43:16.969 --> 43:20.639
They're long gone. We're on our own.

43:23.809 --> 43:25.394
At least we're all together.

43:26.895 --> 43:28.230
We almost weren't.

43:29.315 --> 43:32.276
-If you hadn't caught Will--
-I wouldn't have been able to

43:32.359 --> 43:35.070
if you hadn't shot the harpoon
the second time.

43:38.240 --> 43:39.199
Second time?

44:01.388 --> 44:02.765
Why did you do that?

44:10.314 --> 44:11.148
Do what?

44:11.231 --> 44:14.818
Shoot the harpoon again
so John could climb back on the ship.

44:19.490 --> 44:20.908
Because I was sorry.

44:22.951 --> 44:27.081
I still am. About everything.

44:27.831 --> 44:29.041
Are you, really?

44:32.461 --> 44:34.838
I said it 'cause
it was the right thing to say.

44:37.341 --> 44:38.801
It's what I do.

44:41.178 --> 44:44.181
There's no way I'm letting you out again.

44:56.568 --> 44:57.778
We'll see.

45:19.133 --> 45:22.177
So, what are our options?

45:26.473 --> 45:30.519
If we ration our supplies,
we could maybe survive long enough

45:30.602 --> 45:34.523
for the heat to subside
and we could land again.

45:37.776 --> 45:39.570
Land back down there?

45:41.738 --> 45:43.615
It would actually be more of a crash.

46:00.090 --> 46:01.341
Maureen.

46:11.143 --> 46:12.269
It's the<i> Resolute</i>!

46:16.356 --> 46:19.860
<i>Robinsons, </i>Jupiter 2,
<i>you are clear to dock.</i>

46:20.235 --> 46:21.528
You waited for us.

46:21.987 --> 46:26.867
John, I represent every member
of this colonist group, even you.

46:31.580 --> 46:32.498
Victor...

46:34.208 --> 46:35.459
thank you.

46:36.043 --> 46:37.044
You're welcome.

46:37.127 --> 46:40.297
Sir, we're near the orbit--

46:40.422 --> 46:42.674
Quickly, please.
We've stayed longer than we should.

46:43.425 --> 46:45.427
<i>Actually, we're out of fuel.</i>

46:46.011 --> 46:47.804
Hold tight. We'll come to you.

47:08.784 --> 47:10.953
It's the noise the robot's ship
was making.

47:11.578 --> 47:13.372
So why is our ship making it?

47:31.890 --> 47:35.477
What's going on?
Why... Why are we turning around?

47:37.062 --> 47:38.981
<i>Jupiter 2, </i>is everything okay?

47:39.898 --> 47:43.360
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>It's like we lost control of the ship.</i>

47:56.331 --> 47:58.876
-Ahhh!

48:26.320 --> 48:30.240
I have no idea.

48:35.829 --> 48:36.705
I do.

48:43.754 --> 48:45.130
I think we're here.

48:46.423 --> 48:47.507
Where's "here"?

48:56.433 --> 48:57.476
Danger.
