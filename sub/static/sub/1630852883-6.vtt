Craig: What I hold in my hand
is one piece of a puzzle cube.

00:29.446 --> 00:31.406
The key to finding
the lost treasure

00:31.406 --> 00:33.867
known as
the Heart of the Forest.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.285
And the next piece...

00:35.285 --> 00:37.620
is somewhere in the creek!

00:37.704 --> 00:38.955
Where?

00:38.955 --> 00:40.623
I have no idea.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.126
Worm folk!

00:43.126 --> 00:45.086
Have ye seen a cube?

00:45.170 --> 00:47.046
Yeah, I doubt we'll find
any puzzle pieces

00:47.130 --> 00:48.423
hiding in plain sight.

00:48.423 --> 00:50.049
The legend says
the first king of the creek

00:50.133 --> 00:52.469
gave them only to those
he trusted the most.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.554
And he didn't
trust rocks.

00:54.554 --> 00:55.638
None of us do.

00:55.722 --> 00:56.931
Guys!
Get over here!

00:57.015 --> 00:59.559
I found a cube!

00:59.559 --> 01:00.810
JP!

01:00.894 --> 01:02.979
These aren't cubes,
they're just strawberries.

01:02.979 --> 01:05.940
Yeah, I was just practicing
for when I <i>do</i> find a cube.

01:06.024 --> 01:07.442
Tien: Above you, Chef!

01:07.442 --> 01:09.486
Huh?

01:11.029 --> 01:13.490
Oh, no!
Are you bruised?

01:13.490 --> 01:16.576
Uh, no, I'm sure my vision
will come back sooner or later.

01:16.576 --> 01:18.161
Oh, thank goodness!

01:18.161 --> 01:20.538
I thought you were a goner
for sure!

01:20.622 --> 01:22.624
Uh... Hi?

01:22.624 --> 01:23.833
Oh!

01:23.917 --> 01:25.627
I'm so sorry!

01:25.627 --> 01:27.629
My name's Tien.
Tien Lam.

01:27.629 --> 01:30.131
Heh, sometimes gathering
ingredients in the creek

01:30.215 --> 01:31.716
can be
a little dangerous.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.927
Lost this
foraging for mushrooms.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.970
Got this gathering
some bay leaves.

01:36.054 --> 01:38.181
There was a water slide
involved in that one.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.475
I shouldn't have been
in that backyard.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.894
Ingredients?
Are you a wizard?

01:42.894 --> 01:45.480
Warlock?
A berry mage?!

01:45.480 --> 01:46.481
Close.

01:46.481 --> 01:47.816
Let me show you.

01:47.816 --> 01:51.236
Welcome to
the King's Kitchen.

01:51.236 --> 01:52.487
All: Whoa.

01:52.487 --> 01:53.571
Y'all rich?

01:53.655 --> 01:54.864
This is where
all of the kings

01:54.948 --> 01:56.950
came to have
snack time in style.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.244
But now that the monarchy
has been toppled,

01:59.244 --> 02:01.329
we turned it
into a restaurant.

02:01.329 --> 02:04.666
Yo, Susan,
need another loaf.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.543
Mmm.

02:06.543 --> 02:08.336
Coming right up,
Ramil.

02:12.924 --> 02:15.969
So, what brought you
all over here, anyway?

02:15.969 --> 02:18.263
We are on a quest
to explore the creek

02:18.263 --> 02:21.683
and find a treasure called
the Heart of the Forest.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.101
Hearts of palm
I know about,

02:23.101 --> 02:26.062
but I've never heard of
the Heart of the Forest.

02:26.062 --> 02:27.772
Heh,
nobody knows what it is.

02:27.856 --> 02:31.568
But uncovering mysteries,
exploring the unknown --

02:31.568 --> 02:35.405
for me, that's what makes
afternoons worth livin'.

02:35.405 --> 02:38.658
Heh, I like to think of myself
as an explorer too.

02:38.658 --> 02:42.912
Except, instead of the creek,
I explore taste buds.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.665
My map --
the flavors of the world.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.877
And my treasure -- to cook
everything the tongue can taste.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.962
Beef bulgogi, empanadas --

02:50.962 --> 02:53.464
I wanna cook it all.

02:53.548 --> 02:55.216
Wow.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.718
Um, that sounds
tasty and all,

02:56.718 --> 03:00.179
but this menu just says
peanut butter sandwich.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.931
Where's the bulgogi?

03:02.015 --> 03:03.099
Eh...

03:03.099 --> 03:05.476
It's all because
of our head chef, Rick.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.936
He makes the rules.

03:07.020 --> 03:10.189
And all he wants to cook
are peanut butter sandwiches.

03:10.273 --> 03:12.817
Everyone else has to cook
what he wants.

03:14.777 --> 03:17.780
But...we do keep
a fully stocked pantry.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.449
Gimme a second.

03:29.584 --> 03:32.670
I present to you
PB&J sans crust.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.797
Made with creek-style
strawberry jam,

03:34.881 --> 03:37.383
infused with a hint
of juice box.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.555
Mmm.
This is so good.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.600
Mmm.
I think my tongue is crying.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.644
I'm <i>actually</i> crying.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.103
I'm glad you like it.

03:49.187 --> 03:50.813
Tien!

03:50.897 --> 03:52.899
What are you doing?

03:52.899 --> 03:54.067
Chef, I --

03:54.067 --> 03:55.151
Is that on the menu?

03:55.151 --> 03:56.486
Well, no, but --

03:56.486 --> 03:58.363
Are you head chef?

03:58.363 --> 03:59.530
No, but --

03:59.614 --> 04:03.451
Then why did you
put jam on the menu?!

04:03.451 --> 04:05.578
To balance the saltiness
of the peanut butter

04:05.662 --> 04:07.997
with a sweet --
This is my kitchen.

04:08.081 --> 04:12.502
And until you have one of these,
that's how it stays.

04:12.502 --> 04:13.920
A cube?

04:13.920 --> 04:16.839
Guys, get over here!
I found a cube.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.342
This is why you practice,
you guys.

04:19.342 --> 04:21.010
Gimme those.

04:26.349 --> 04:27.517
Oof!

04:29.811 --> 04:33.231
I miss that sandwich.

04:33.231 --> 04:36.109
How did that griddle goblin
get a cube?

04:36.109 --> 04:38.569
By challenging the head chef
to a cook off.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.363
Have you ever
challenged him?

04:40.363 --> 04:41.489
No way.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.282
I'll risk my arm
for fresh herbs,

04:43.366 --> 04:45.618
but I'm not risking my place
in this kitchen.

04:45.702 --> 04:48.538
This is my only chance to learn
how to be a real chef.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.498
Maybe you guys can challenge him
but I --

04:50.498 --> 04:54.752
Hey, Rick! Get your
butter-lovin' fingers out here.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.212
What'd you say to me?

04:56.212 --> 04:59.382
I've got my father's hands,
and I'm proud of 'em.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.843
We challenge you
to a cook-off.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.886
Whoever makes the best
peanut butter sandwich

05:03.970 --> 05:05.513
gets to keep the cube.

05:05.513 --> 05:07.890
Ha!
There's no way you babies

05:07.974 --> 05:10.393
can make a better
peanut butter sandwich than me.

05:10.393 --> 05:11.811
I'm 10 1/2.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.312
I've been making sandwiches

05:13.396 --> 05:17.108
since you were making doo-doos
in your diapers.

05:17.108 --> 05:20.069
Well, it's time
for a change.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.989
Not diaper change.
I mean -- Never mind.

05:25.324 --> 05:28.745
Let the challenge begin!

05:35.418 --> 05:37.295
Kelsey: <i>With her weapon imbued
with peanut butter,</i>

05:37.295 --> 05:39.130
<i>Kelsey would go
from master warrior</i>

05:39.130 --> 05:42.258
<i>to master chef
with one deft swoop.</i>

05:42.258 --> 05:43.551
Agh!

05:43.551 --> 05:46.429
Looks like she made a PB&JP.

05:46.429 --> 05:49.098
This is no time
for hilarious jokes, Susan.

05:49.182 --> 05:52.101
She's gonna need better knife
skills than that to beat Rick.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.270
Yo, why's that kid
got a bow?

05:54.270 --> 05:57.106
Maybe he's making
a bow-loney sandwich?

05:57.190 --> 05:58.816
Huh?
Susan!

06:00.860 --> 06:03.946
Guess it's up to
your man Craig.

06:04.030 --> 06:07.366
Ooh, nice move,
save the heel for stuffing.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.702
This Craig knows his way
around a loaf.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.246
Ohh, and he chose
the good peanut butter.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.874
Oh, no.
It's all-natural peanut butter.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.626
I hope he knows
the oil separates.

06:16.626 --> 06:20.129
He's gotta stir it
or else --

06:21.172 --> 06:22.632
Time!

06:22.632 --> 06:27.762
Uh, today we have for you
a peanut butter sandwich with...

06:27.762 --> 06:29.722
extra...sauce...

06:36.521 --> 06:37.688
Next!

06:37.772 --> 06:39.232
Mortimer and I cooked a...

06:39.232 --> 06:41.818
smashed peanut butter sandwich,

06:41.818 --> 06:44.278
garnished with
some birdseed.

06:47.990 --> 06:49.283
Next!

06:49.367 --> 06:52.036
Omar: Uh,
it's a peanut butter sandwich...

06:52.120 --> 06:54.413
on a...stick.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.499
Ugh, next.

06:56.499 --> 06:59.335
Wait, we-- we're supposed to
make peanut butter sandwiches?

06:59.335 --> 07:01.170
Uh, I think I messed up.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.505
Next!

07:02.505 --> 07:05.174
Rick: Judge, today we have
for you a most delicious

07:05.258 --> 07:07.051
classic peanut butter sandwich.

07:07.135 --> 07:10.388
Served lunch style --
with a diagonal slice.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.520
Ahhh.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.233
And the winner is...

07:22.233 --> 07:23.734
Chef Rick.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.695
Of course I won.

07:25.695 --> 07:29.073
None of you so-called cooks
can hold a ladle to me.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.325
I'm the best chef to ever work
in this kitchen.

07:31.409 --> 07:34.245
No, I'm the <i>only</i> chef
to work in this kitchen.

07:34.245 --> 07:35.913
You're wrong, Rick.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.456
Excuse me?

07:37.540 --> 07:39.834
How you run this place
is wrong.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.294
You call yourself
a chef,

07:41.294 --> 07:43.296
but you don't care
about your kitchen.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.214
If you were a real chef,
you'd know that

07:45.298 --> 07:48.551
Susan makes an amazing
pineapple upside-down cake.

07:48.551 --> 07:51.929
And that Ramil makes lumpia
that would blow your mind.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.931
And you'd know that
we can make a lot more

07:54.015 --> 07:55.558
than peanut butter
sandwiches.

07:55.558 --> 07:59.103
But I'm starting to think that's
the only thing you can make.

08:00.438 --> 08:02.398
That's why it's the only thing
we serve.

08:02.398 --> 08:04.025
But I'm gonna
change that.

08:04.025 --> 08:07.904
I challenge you for the cube
and the title of the head chef.

08:07.904 --> 08:11.199
Fine, but to prove
I'm more than a sandwich chef,

08:11.199 --> 08:14.952
I challenge you
to making peanut butter...

08:15.036 --> 08:17.330
crepe pancakes.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.956
You're on.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.421
Let the challenge...

08:25.421 --> 08:27.089
begin!

08:39.519 --> 08:41.103
They're neck and neck.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.195
Oh, sugar.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.655
What's wrong?
What happened?

08:50.655 --> 08:53.616
I forgot the sugar.

08:53.616 --> 08:56.118
Hah!
What's a dessert without sugar?

08:56.202 --> 08:59.497
Put some marmalade on your face.
You're toast.

09:00.915 --> 09:02.583
Looks like Tien's
got something up his sleeve.

09:02.667 --> 09:03.918
He's going to the pantry.

09:03.918 --> 09:06.379
He's changing the recipe
at the last minute.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.131
He's going...
savory.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.594
He's cooking
from the heart!

09:13.678 --> 09:15.221
Like a real chef!

09:23.813 --> 09:25.106
Time!

09:25.106 --> 09:27.942
Rick: Chef, I present to you,
a peanut butter crepe

09:27.942 --> 09:29.694
drizzled with a peanut butter sauce

09:29.694 --> 09:31.988
and topped with
crushed peanuts.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.406
Enjoy.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.116
Mmm.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.706
Today I have prepared
bánh xeo --

09:41.706 --> 09:44.292
a Vietnamese-style crepe
filled with shrimp,

09:44.292 --> 09:46.377
bean sprouts,
cilantro, and mint.

09:46.377 --> 09:51.674
And served with a side of
peanut butter dipping sauce.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.010
Mmm.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.804
Ohhh, mmm, yay!

09:56.804 --> 09:59.015
Oh, my gosh.

09:59.015 --> 10:02.893
Tien's dish is so good it
brought back the elder's youth.

10:02.977 --> 10:04.854
Tien is the winner.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.564
- Yeah, Tien!
- Whoo-hoo!

10:06.564 --> 10:09.025
Wh-- B-B-But how?

10:09.025 --> 10:11.110
I realized you were great
at what you do,

10:11.110 --> 10:14.947
so if I wanted to beat you,
I had to do what I do best.

10:15.031 --> 10:17.199
And that's taking chances.

10:21.162 --> 10:23.372
Tien,
I'm sorry.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.709
I-I just got so into running
the kitchen and all, you know?

10:26.709 --> 10:30.046
But I-I think I could really
learn a thing or two from you...

10:30.046 --> 10:31.756
Head Chef.

10:33.966 --> 10:36.260
We're so excited
to try this new menu.

10:36.344 --> 10:37.303
Thanks, Craig.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.637
You all
really inspired me

10:38.721 --> 10:41.015
to stand up for myself
and everyone else.

10:41.015 --> 10:42.808
I couldn't have done it
without you.

10:42.892 --> 10:47.396
So, I brought you
one last dish -- off menu.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.564
The cube.

10:48.564 --> 10:51.442
A-Are you sure
you can part with this?

10:51.442 --> 10:52.526
Yeah.

10:52.610 --> 10:54.820
We don't need a head chef
anymore.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.156
A toast to Tien!

10:57.156 --> 10:58.240
- Tien!
- Tien!
