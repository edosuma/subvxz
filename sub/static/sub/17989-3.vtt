00:05.737 --> 00:11.926
Only one creature has carved a life
for itself in every habitat on Earth.

00:13.457 --> 00:16.688
That creature is us.

00:17.897 --> 00:24.450
All over the world, we still use our
ingenuity to survive in the wild places,

00:24.497 --> 00:30.174
far from the city lights,
face to face with raw nature.

00:31.497 --> 00:34.853
This is the Human Planet.

00:48.137 --> 00:53.336
At the top of our planet lies
one of the most remote places on Earth.

00:54.697 --> 00:56.688
The Arctic.

01:03.297 --> 01:08.166
In winter, the region is frozen
and dark for months on end.

01:14.897 --> 01:19.527
There are no trees
and there are no plants to eat.

01:23.657 --> 01:27.616
We humans weren't built to withstand
a landscape as hostile as this.

01:30.177 --> 01:33.647
And yet four million people live here.

01:36.857 --> 01:40.532
Their survival relies upon
an intimate knowledge of this,

01:40.577 --> 01:44.126
the most hostile habitat on Earth.

02:18.977 --> 02:21.571
The beginning of a new arctic year.

02:24.697 --> 02:30.488
After months of winter darkness, the sun
finally returns to this frozen land.

02:37.697 --> 02:40.336
For the Inuit of Saattut, Greenland,

02:40.377 --> 02:44.768
the sun's return marks the beginning
of their hunting calendar.

02:52.777 --> 02:58.215
Now that the residents have enough
daylight, a world of opportunity opens up.

03:03.417 --> 03:07.729
They can embark on expeditions
far from town...

03:12.137 --> 03:15.334
...travelling across the thousands
of kilometres of sea ice

03:15.377 --> 03:17.766
that lead to their hunting grounds.

03:34.297 --> 03:39.690
Today, Amos Jensen and his son
Karl-Frederik have to feed their dogs.

03:43.217 --> 03:44.809
Their dogs are essential.

03:44.857 --> 03:50.568
At this time of year, the dogsled
is their only means of transportation.

04:01.497 --> 04:04.614
Because their hunting trip
could take some time,

04:04.657 --> 04:07.808
father and son will need
a few comforts of home,

04:07.857 --> 04:11.566
or even home itself.

04:22.097 --> 04:25.169
To find the most nutritious dog food,

04:25.217 --> 04:30.450
Amos and Karl-Frederik need to travel
many kilometres across the sea ice.

04:34.777 --> 04:41.296
What they're after is a real-life
arctic sea monster, a Greenland shark.

04:58.817 --> 05:04.050
To support their weight, the ice
only needs to be five centimetres thick,

05:04.097 --> 05:05.928
about two inches.

05:09.817 --> 05:15.687
This ice is nearly a metre thick,
and it could support a jumbo jet.

05:25.817 --> 05:30.527
Amos knows that Greenland sharks
are partial to whale meat.

05:32.537 --> 05:36.576
And he also knows
they live in the deepest waters.

05:43.777 --> 05:49.647
Now, both men and dogs have to wait
for something to take the bait.

06:13.897 --> 06:18.334
As temperatures plummet
to -35 degrees Celsius,

06:18.377 --> 06:20.766
the dogs'thick fur keeps them warm.

06:26.657 --> 06:31.367
But without their hut, Amos
and Karl-Frederik would freeze to death.

06:46.617 --> 06:49.893
It's time to check
if the dogs will eat today.

06:57.377 --> 07:00.210
From the vibrations
he feels on the fishing line,

07:00.257 --> 07:02.771
he knows they've hooked something.

07:05.937 --> 07:09.725
But he won't know if it's a shark
until they pull it up.

07:17.177 --> 07:19.247
It's down so deep

07:19.297 --> 07:23.973
they have to stretch their fishing line
along the ice in hundred-metre lengths.

07:30.977 --> 07:34.094
They pull their catch up
a staggering 800 metres,

07:34.137 --> 07:37.607
nearly twice the height
of the Empire State Building.

08:14.817 --> 08:18.492
They've caught the Greenland shark
they were hoping for.

08:34.897 --> 08:38.810
The Greenland shark
is the only native arctic shark.

08:40.417 --> 08:43.932
It's one of the largest predators
in these seas.

08:47.697 --> 08:52.691
Researchers have found caribou
and even polar bears in its stomach.

08:59.817 --> 09:03.526
The shark has accidentally wrapped
the fishing line round its tail.

09:06.497 --> 09:12.049
It's not the normal way to land a shark,
but a catch is a catch.

09:45.297 --> 09:48.209
Amos and Karl
can't lift the shark by themselves

09:48.257 --> 09:50.134
so they enlist the help of the dogs.

10:07.257 --> 10:10.454
This shark is four metres long,
weighs over half a ton

10:10.497 --> 10:13.455
and is the largest they've ever caught.

10:17.137 --> 10:20.891
But it will only feed their 20 dogs
for two weeks.

10:32.217 --> 10:35.289
For Greenlanders,
it is essential to have well-fed dogs

10:35.337 --> 10:38.454
if they're to continue
hunting and fishing.

11:02.697 --> 11:07.009
Here in the Arctic, the bond
between man and dog is so important.

11:07.057 --> 11:12.893
It's unlikely we would have colonised
this habitat without our best friends.

11:15.297 --> 11:19.370
As the year moves on,
so does the quest for survival.

11:23.497 --> 11:27.775
Even though it's March, the Arctic Ocean
is still dominated by sea ice.

11:30.697 --> 11:35.487
An area four times the size
of the United States is frozen over.

11:38.977 --> 11:44.574
The ice connects Europe to Russia,
and Russia to North America.

11:47.017 --> 11:50.009
And here in the Canadian Arctic,

11:50.057 --> 11:53.970
people have a unique insight
into what lies beneath the ice.

11:56.137 --> 12:02.406
In Kangiqsujjuaq, northeast Canada,
Lukasi Nappaaluk is watching the tides.

12:04.097 --> 12:09.535
Tomorrow, the spring equinox will create
the most extreme tides of the year,

12:09.577 --> 12:13.365
and a spectacular opportunity for a meal.

12:30.217 --> 12:32.606
The neap tide literally opens a door

12:32.657 --> 12:36.172
for a garden of seafood
just below the ice.

12:37.497 --> 12:41.092
You just need to know where to find it.

12:45.777 --> 12:50.009
Lukasi and his friends
prefer snowmobiles to dogsleds.

12:53.257 --> 12:56.408
And they don't bother
to bring along a shelter either.

13:02.177 --> 13:05.453
Everything they need to protect
themselves from the elements

13:05.497 --> 13:07.408
is right beneath their feet.

13:27.337 --> 13:31.933
Even if it's -45 degrees Celsius outside,

13:31.977 --> 13:38.450
body warmth can heat an igloo
to a balmy +1 6,

13:38.497 --> 13:40.169
a full 60 degrees warmer.

13:54.937 --> 14:00.330
Cosy inside their igloo,
Lukasi and his friends must now wait.

14:02.377 --> 14:06.450
Before they can hunt,
something extraordinary has to happen.

14:15.497 --> 14:19.410
Underneath the sea ice,
the tide is going out...

14:21.497 --> 14:23.488
...and out.

14:27.097 --> 14:32.125
The floating ice drops a staggering
1 2 metres, nearly 40 feet,

14:32.177 --> 14:37.809
exposing the seabed, and,
hopefully, the bounty they're after.

14:40.777 --> 14:46.409
Lukasi and his friends try to get
under the ice as quickly as possible.

14:48.257 --> 14:52.853
They have just half an hour
before the tide comes back in.

14:59.297 --> 15:02.767
The world beneath their feet is unstable.

15:03.897 --> 15:07.651
The giant blocks of ice
are no longer supported by water

15:07.697 --> 15:10.211
and could collapse at any moment.

15:30.857 --> 15:35.647
This is the only place on Earth
where the tides are extreme enough

15:35.697 --> 15:39.849
to allow people to dare venture
under the sea ice.

15:43.057 --> 15:45.890
And in a chamber
that moments ago was underwater,

15:45.937 --> 15:48.497
they find what they're looking for.

15:50.097 --> 15:52.372
Mussels.

15:53.457 --> 15:55.971
All they could hope for.

15:59.777 --> 16:04.009
Now they have just minutes
to gather all they can carry.

16:07.417 --> 16:10.329
The returning tide
is an unstoppable force.

16:30.017 --> 16:32.406
As the sea steadily flows back,

16:32.457 --> 16:36.052
it lifts the huge blocks of ice
over their heads.

16:42.377 --> 16:45.892
Even as they escape,
the ice shifts around them.

16:52.617 --> 16:55.529
The ocean reclaims its secret garden.

17:05.257 --> 17:10.854
Lukasi can only harvest mussels
for the few days of extreme tides.

17:24.617 --> 17:26.972
Mussels are a delicious way
to break up a diet

17:27.017 --> 17:30.851
that during winter
has been mainly seal meat and fish.

17:33.257 --> 17:38.411
But summer is on the way,
and everything is about to change.

17:45.977 --> 17:50.573
By June, the sun finally pushes
temperatures above zero.

17:53.417 --> 17:55.214
The sea ice begins to melt.

17:57.697 --> 18:03.454
And as it breaks apart,
it triggers an annual summer migration.

18:09.097 --> 18:12.294
Animals that have spent
the winter far offshore

18:12.337 --> 18:15.170
follow the melting ice
into the bays and fjords.

18:18.337 --> 18:23.934
For arctic hunters,
this creates a unique opportunity.

18:36.617 --> 18:40.087
Mamarut Kristiansen,
and his brothers Mikele and Gedion,

18:40.137 --> 18:42.810
are Thule Inuit from northern Greenland.

18:43.857 --> 18:49.056
They're rushing to keep the most important
appointment in their hunting calendar.

18:50.217 --> 18:52.447
They must be punctual.

18:52.497 --> 18:57.332
In just a few weeks, the sea ice
they're travelling on will melt away.

18:58.977 --> 19:02.811
Their goal is the most precious food
in the Arctic.

19:07.217 --> 19:09.856
Narwhal.

19:16.537 --> 19:20.928
These legendary whales
are looking for a way into the bay.

19:23.017 --> 19:25.690
This is a mythic creature...

19:30.617 --> 19:35.611
...but it is also a source
of the rarest vitamin in the Arctic.

19:37.057 --> 19:39.252
Vitamin C.

19:47.257 --> 19:50.693
In a landscape
with so few edible fruits or plants,

19:50.737 --> 19:53.968
the Inuit don't have alternatives.

20:12.617 --> 20:15.336
Spotting narwhal is hard enough.

20:15.377 --> 20:19.734
Even scientists who study them
rarely see them.

20:19.777 --> 20:21.972
But if Mikele is going to catch one,

20:22.017 --> 20:25.976
the narwhal will have to swim
a great deal closer than this.

20:41.057 --> 20:44.891
It could be weeks before
the three brothers see narwhal again.

20:47.097 --> 20:51.170
But they have to stay alert,
and there's plenty to prepare.

20:52.897 --> 20:58.972
In this region, the law states that
hunters can only use traditional methods.

20:59.017 --> 21:05.047
This means travelling in kayaks, a craft
the Inuit invented thousands of years ago,

21:05.097 --> 21:10.330
and using the avatak, a buoy
made from the skin of a ring seal.

21:29.657 --> 21:33.570
Even though it's midnight,
the sun still shines.

21:33.617 --> 21:39.692
In June, the sun simply circles the sky,
never dipping below the horizon.

21:54.057 --> 21:57.493
It's vital that one of them
stands guard at all times.

21:58.817 --> 22:02.048
But Gedion isn't just looking for narwhal.

22:05.777 --> 22:07.768
He's watching the ice.

22:12.537 --> 22:16.655
Already it's thinning and breaking apart.

22:20.217 --> 22:21.775
If they're not careful,

22:21.817 --> 22:26.413
the brothers could find themselves
adrift on a melting piece of ice.

23:37.937 --> 23:41.373
Mamarut and Gedion know not to panic.

23:42.577 --> 23:49.608
Narwhal are extremely skittish,
so the hunters enter the water with care.

24:04.057 --> 24:06.332
The three brothers work as a team.

24:08.457 --> 24:11.529
They're afterjust one whale.

24:14.977 --> 24:17.093
It's an ambush.

24:23.497 --> 24:27.695
The narwhal pass
within 50 feet of Mikele...

24:29.777 --> 24:32.974
...but still all three hunters wait.

24:36.337 --> 24:40.012
If he strikes too soon,
the whole pod will dive.

24:51.297 --> 24:54.812
His eye is on the stragglers
bringing up the rear.

25:08.057 --> 25:12.926
Especially in the final approach,
Mikele must be silent...

25:14.937 --> 25:17.656
...and directly behind his prey.

26:27.897 --> 26:32.175
Their success will benefit
the whole community.

26:32.217 --> 26:37.166
The single narwhal will feed
their families for weeks, if not months.

26:48.617 --> 26:51.529
The most prized part
of the narwhal is the skin.

26:51.577 --> 26:53.533
They call it muktuk.

26:53.577 --> 26:57.047
It's their primary source of vitamin C.

26:57.097 --> 27:03.445
Ounce for ounce, narwhal skin contains
almost as much vitamin C as oranges.

27:11.177 --> 27:12.576
Without narwhal,

27:12.617 --> 27:16.610
it's doubtful the Inuit would ever
have survived in this part of the Arctic.

27:21.497 --> 27:26.093
It's now July,
and the sun finally wins its battle.

27:27.657 --> 27:31.286
The sea ice melts into open ocean.

27:34.297 --> 27:39.007
To find food,
man turns his attention to the land.

27:46.497 --> 27:51.969
Siorapaluk, Greenland, is the northernmost
native settlement on Earth.

27:53.217 --> 27:57.927
Every year, Maassannguaq Oshima
is treated to a spectacle.

27:59.577 --> 28:02.455
Millions of little auks on migration.

28:03.937 --> 28:07.054
They come here to breed on the cliffs.

28:10.777 --> 28:11.971
And for predators,

28:12.017 --> 28:15.726
there's a mouth-watering supply
of protein whizzing overhead.

28:18.497 --> 28:20.613
If you can reach it.

29:05.417 --> 29:06.816
Thousands of years ago,

29:06.857 --> 29:12.056
Maassannguaq's ancestors worked out how
to make nets out of sinew and driftwood.

29:13.057 --> 29:17.847
And they created the same hiding spots
he uses today.

29:29.937 --> 29:33.213
On a good day, Maassannguaq
can gather up to 500 birds.

29:37.937 --> 29:39.928
But he won't eat them now.

29:43.857 --> 29:46.769
He'll take his cue from a fellow hunter.

29:47.857 --> 29:51.611
Arctic foxes often stuff
a few birds underground,

29:51.657 --> 29:55.491
so that when times are lean,
they'll have food to fall back on.

30:10.057 --> 30:12.776
The birds can be used to make kiviak,

30:12.817 --> 30:16.287
a dish that you save for a rainy day.

30:17.697 --> 30:22.054
The recipe is thousands of years old,
and it goes like this.

30:24.337 --> 30:26.168
Take one seal skin.

30:29.497 --> 30:32.807
Stuff as many little auks inside it
as you can.

30:35.497 --> 30:38.091
At least 500.

30:39.737 --> 30:42.092
Sew it up.

30:42.137 --> 30:44.970
Make sure you press all the air out.

30:49.337 --> 30:54.013
Seal fat repels flies,
so be generous when coating the seams.

30:55.497 --> 31:01.208
And finally, use a big rock
to make sure no more air gets in.

31:08.217 --> 31:11.414
Maassannguaq's kiviak
won't be ready for three months,

31:11.457 --> 31:14.847
but the frozen ground
is a natural refrigerator.

31:17.057 --> 31:22.051
Come winter, he and his family
will have a vital supply of food.

31:31.297 --> 31:33.606
It's now September.

31:35.417 --> 31:39.535
Days are getting shorter
and temperatures are plummeting.

31:39.577 --> 31:44.332
The few plants that have managed
to grow over the short arctic summer

31:44.377 --> 31:46.254
are dying back.

31:48.857 --> 31:53.851
This is exactly what is happening
on Arnoy island, northern Norway.

32:00.177 --> 32:04.056
3,000 reindeer
have been grazing here all summer.

32:06.377 --> 32:08.493
But now they have to move,

32:08.537 --> 32:15.295
because their winter food source, lichen,
can only be found 450 kilometres away.

32:16.377 --> 32:21.849
And to get to it, they'll have to
cross this, the Arnoy strait.

32:25.377 --> 32:29.928
Elle-Helene Siri is in charge of leading
these reindeer across the water.

32:33.777 --> 32:37.850
She belongs to a family
of Sami reindeer herders.

32:45.697 --> 32:47.255
Before the migration begins,

32:47.297 --> 32:51.051
Elle helps split the deer
into smaller groups

32:51.097 --> 32:53.008
so they can give them vital medicine.

33:09.057 --> 33:13.767
On the day she was born,
Elle was given a portion of this herd.

33:16.737 --> 33:21.652
Now aged 20, and a recent graduate
of Norway's reindeer college,

33:21.697 --> 33:25.690
it's up to her to make sure they all
survive the perilous journey ahead.

33:31.017 --> 33:35.693
It will take nearly a month for these deer
to migrate to their winter pastures.

33:39.457 --> 33:41.493
But today is the toughest day of all,

33:41.537 --> 33:45.689
because the deer have to swim two
and a half kilometres across the channel.

33:59.257 --> 34:03.614
These chilly arctic waters
are only just above freezing.

34:05.937 --> 34:09.691
Even for adult reindeer
this is a long swim.

34:15.217 --> 34:19.529
But for this year's calves,
which have never been in the water before,

34:19.577 --> 34:21.533
it's a marathon.

35:01.817 --> 35:06.686
As the young calves approach
the halfway point, exhaustion sets in.

35:13.177 --> 35:15.372
For Elle, it's a tense moment...

35:16.977 --> 35:21.971
...because if one calf turns around
and swims back, the rest could follow.

35:44.097 --> 35:48.932
A baby female is in trouble,
and suddenly, she turns back.

35:48.977 --> 35:53.289
Elle must stop her
or the whole migration could derail.

36:15.617 --> 36:17.608
She's done it.

36:17.657 --> 36:20.251
The migration remains on track.

36:44.017 --> 36:50.456
After an hour of hard swimming,
Elle and her reindeer reach the mainland.

37:05.177 --> 37:08.726
It won't be long
before Elle's deer will be grazing

37:08.777 --> 37:11.769
on the lichen they need
to get them through the winter.

37:15.777 --> 37:19.850
And it's not just animals
looking for a meal at this time of year.

37:23.977 --> 37:27.731
In Greenland, Maassannguaq and his father
are already breaking into

37:27.777 --> 37:32.567
the caches of little auks
they stored up in the summer.

37:34.697 --> 37:42.092
The birds have now fermented and have
become the Inuit delicacy known as kiviak.

37:43.817 --> 37:47.890
It's easy to tell if your kiviak is ready
by the aroma.

37:49.297 --> 37:51.652
It should sting the nostrils.

37:54.577 --> 37:59.173
This is why it's polite
always to serve kiviak outdoors.

38:04.337 --> 38:09.775
The flavour should resemble
extremely intense Gorgonzola cheese.

38:12.657 --> 38:17.287
Nothing is wasted. Everything is edible.

38:22.777 --> 38:25.974
The Inuit of northern Greenland
love kiviak so much

38:26.017 --> 38:30.647
that it's the dish of choice
for birthdays and weddings.

38:30.697 --> 38:34.007
And it's nutritious,
full of vitamins and minerals

38:34.057 --> 38:37.447
that will sustain people
over the winter months ahead.

38:43.937 --> 38:49.967
As September gives way to October,
winter returns to the Arctic.

38:54.017 --> 38:56.929
The ocean ices over once again.

39:00.137 --> 39:05.211
One of the first places to freeze
lies along Hudson's Bay

39:05.257 --> 39:08.055
near the town of Churchill, Manitoba.

39:10.817 --> 39:14.366
Every year, the 1,000 human residents
must share their town

39:14.417 --> 39:19.810
with one of the few predators on Earth
that actively hunts human beings.

39:29.217 --> 39:30.889
From September to November,

39:30.937 --> 39:34.976
as many as 300 ravenous polar bears
descend on Churchill

39:35.017 --> 39:37.929
on their way back to hunt on the sea ice.

39:41.817 --> 39:45.446
Bob Windsor is in charge
of protecting the residents.

39:45.497 --> 39:50.810
He belongs to a special task force -
the Polar Bear Alert team.

39:52.377 --> 39:56.052
Polar bears are pure predators,
so they kill other animals to eat.

39:56.097 --> 39:57.974
That's how they survive.

39:58.017 --> 40:01.054
Knowing that, you have to give them
a little more respect

40:01.097 --> 40:03.895
because you could also be
a potential meal for them.

40:11.137 --> 40:12.934
This is one nine zero.

40:12.977 --> 40:16.936
Just to let everybody know
that there's a bear coming towards town.

40:20.657 --> 40:22.295
As a first line of defence,

40:22.337 --> 40:25.647
Bob tries to frighten the bear
back into the wilderness.

40:34.897 --> 40:37.252
But this skirmish isn't necessarily over.

40:38.737 --> 40:43.367
Desperate for something to eat, bears
often return under cover of darkness...

40:52.657 --> 40:54.887
...which is bad news for Bob,

40:54.937 --> 40:59.852
because tonight, more than
any other night, fills him with dread.

40:59.897 --> 41:03.526
Halloween is probably the busiest
night of the year that we work,

41:03.577 --> 41:08.048
just by the sheer number of people
that are out and about that evening.

41:13.737 --> 41:18.367
So, the potential for something bad
to happen is definitely there.

41:26.497 --> 41:30.376
At the same time
as the trick-or-treaters hit the streets,

41:30.417 --> 41:35.935
people at the Royal Legion
gather for their weekly meat raffle.

41:35.977 --> 41:40.687
The prize for winning
is prime Canadian beef.

41:40.737 --> 41:43.297
Next ticket...

41:43.337 --> 41:46.090
number 440.

41:46.137 --> 41:48.890
Ha-ha-ha-ha! Yeah!

42:00.217 --> 42:02.333
This may seem cavalier,

42:02.377 --> 42:06.290
but the residents of Churchill
refuse to live in fear.

42:07.937 --> 42:12.215
And the protection of the polar bear
patrol makes them feel safe.

42:14.577 --> 42:16.215
However, in the past,

42:16.257 --> 42:21.047
bears have mauled and killed people
right here on Main Street,

42:21.097 --> 42:23.565
and Bob is all too aware of the risks.

42:26.417 --> 42:30.330
You always hope and pray
that nothing bad is gonna happen.

42:31.497 --> 42:36.332
Keep your eyes open,
be aware of your surroundings

42:36.377 --> 42:40.131
and always be thinking
that there could be a bear nearby.

42:42.697 --> 42:44.927
They'll move around. You won't hear them.

42:44.977 --> 42:47.013
Hi! Trick or treat!

42:47.057 --> 42:50.288
We kind of refer to them
sometimes as ghosts,

42:50.337 --> 42:52.612
cos they'll just disappear on you.

42:54.377 --> 42:59.132
They'll be there, and then, "Where
did it go?"A little spooky that way.

43:02.217 --> 43:07.052
They're amazingly fast, amazingly agile,
and amazingly stealthful.

43:08.897 --> 43:12.173
Trick or treat!

43:15.937 --> 43:18.405
- Hi, guys! How you doin'?
- Trick or treat.

43:18.457 --> 43:19.856
Trick or treat?

43:19.897 --> 43:22.889
- Have you seen any bears?
- No, it's been good tonight.

43:22.937 --> 43:24.893
There was a bear in town earlier today.

43:24.937 --> 43:28.816
- But there's been nothing tonight at all.
- Did you hear that? We're safe.

43:28.857 --> 43:30.575
You have a good night tonight, OK?

43:30.617 --> 43:33.006
Keep your eyes open
for polar bears too, OK?

43:33.057 --> 43:35.173
- Thank you, guys.
- Bye-bye!

43:35.217 --> 43:37.777
- Happy Halloween!
- See you, little bear!

43:37.817 --> 43:39.569
Happy Halloweenie!

43:46.097 --> 43:50.056
Tonight the residents
of Churchill are safe,

43:50.097 --> 43:53.772
but it was a closer call
than many of them realised.

43:54.817 --> 43:57.650
Inside this bear trap is proof

43:57.697 --> 44:02.532
trick-or-treaters weren't the only ones
stalking the streets last night.

44:02.577 --> 44:08.015
Lured into the cage by seal meat,
this male weighs over half a ton.

44:14.657 --> 44:20.254
This bear is sedated and will be flown
at least 60 kilometres outside of town.

44:27.617 --> 44:29.016
In the past,

44:29.057 --> 44:34.085
an average of 75 bears per year
have been transported out of Churchill.

44:39.417 --> 44:43.376
But in recent years,
the number of invading bears has halved

44:43.417 --> 44:47.012
because in this part of the Arctic,
polar bears are in decline.

44:57.377 --> 45:01.290
They have timed the sedative
so that it wears off soon after they land.

45:03.977 --> 45:08.892
This is done so that bears can protect
themselves from other bears in the area.

45:09.897 --> 45:15.255
For Officer Windsor, it means working fast
before this bear fully wakes up.

45:17.817 --> 45:21.492
A single swipe from a male this size
could be fatal.

45:25.617 --> 45:30.168
It's a great feeling
cos here it is, you're letting them go.

45:30.217 --> 45:33.129
You can't help but wonder
where's it gonna be going,

45:33.177 --> 45:35.088
how is it gonna make out.

45:38.497 --> 45:42.809
Very satisfying to see a bear
actually get up and go on its way.

45:48.617 --> 45:53.133
Wish them well and hope for the best
and hope to never seem 'em again in town.

46:03.057 --> 46:04.934
With the sea ice forming fast,

46:04.977 --> 46:10.574
it won't be long before this polar bear
can roam far and wide in search of food.

46:13.937 --> 46:19.011
But for people, moving around the Arctic
is about to get a lot more treacherous,

46:19.057 --> 46:22.367
because the sun is deserting them.

46:22.417 --> 46:29.289
It's November in Ilulissat, Greenland, and
the sun no longer rises above the horizon.

46:31.457 --> 46:35.655
The residents won't see daylight
for another 54 days.

46:37.817 --> 46:42.937
They try to live their lives as normal.
They still hunt and fish.

46:44.657 --> 46:47.251
Adults go to work.

46:48.857 --> 46:51.246
Children go to school.

46:52.297 --> 46:55.926
But it's all under the cover of darkness.

47:02.177 --> 47:08.366
As the dark days drag on,
everybody yearns for the sun to come back.

47:20.897 --> 47:25.288
Finally, on January 1 3th,
they get their wish.

47:25.337 --> 47:29.091
The entire community
comes out to celebrate

47:29.137 --> 47:31.287
the first sunrise of the new year.

47:43.297 --> 47:48.451
With every new sunrise,
the Arctic is warming up.

47:51.057 --> 47:54.811
And the seasonal opportunities
that have made life possible

47:54.857 --> 47:57.166
may not be here in years to come.

47:59.937 --> 48:04.931
However, the people of the Arctic
are born survivors.

48:04.977 --> 48:12.486
If there's anyone who can adapt to the
changes on the horizon, surely it's them.

48:21.857 --> 48:26.373
For the arctic team, the narwhal hunt
was always going to be a challenge.

48:28.097 --> 48:30.053
The hunt happens in the spring,

48:30.097 --> 48:34.568
when the sea ice
is at its most fragile and dangerous.

48:44.937 --> 48:47.690
Even knowing the risks,
no-one could have foreseen

48:47.737 --> 48:52.174
quite how much drama they would face
in this treacherous place.

49:01.217 --> 49:02.889
Day one on the ice,

49:02.937 --> 49:07.647
and the experienced crew,
including polar cameraman Doug Allan,

49:07.697 --> 49:09.767
are busy loading the sleds.

49:09.817 --> 49:13.856
This is what you need to take six people
out onto the ice for about a fortnight.

49:13.897 --> 49:16.047
It's a hell of a lot of stuff, isn't it?

49:17.217 --> 49:20.289
We've probably got
about 400 kilos between six people.

49:20.337 --> 49:25.809
So, to say we're travelling light
is possibly a little understatement!

49:25.857 --> 49:28.849
With the kit and a person on board,

49:28.897 --> 49:32.287
each dogsled is having to carry
about 1 00 kilos of freight,

49:32.337 --> 49:36.125
which is quite a lot, really,
between 1 2 dogs.

49:39.817 --> 49:44.049
But this is what these dogs are bred for,
and they're in their element.

49:44.097 --> 49:48.852
They set off across 2 7 kilometres
of sea ice to open water.

49:51.017 --> 49:54.407
Three brothers,
Mamarut, Gedion and Mikele,

49:54.457 --> 49:57.927
lead the crew on their quest for narwhal.

50:04.257 --> 50:06.134
After only a couple of hours,

50:06.177 --> 50:09.135
the expedition encounters
their first sign of danger.

50:10.697 --> 50:13.495
You can quite distinctly
see the movement here.

50:13.537 --> 50:17.246
The swell's coming in from the open ocean
and it's just breaking it up.

50:17.297 --> 50:21.006
And this little crack here,
which you can put your finger down,

50:21.057 --> 50:24.367
maybe 1 5 minutes from now,
it's gonna be this wide.

50:24.417 --> 50:27.215
Half an hour,
it will be too wide to cross.

50:27.257 --> 50:30.806
So, you really have to be careful.
This ice is on the move all the time.

50:30.857 --> 50:34.975
The Inuit hunters
decide the ice is too unstable

50:35.017 --> 50:39.215
and the expedition
is forced back to the safety of land.

50:39.257 --> 50:41.452
After five and a half hours of travelling,

50:41.497 --> 50:44.375
we've come all the way across
the...the inlet.

50:44.417 --> 50:48.649
The ice edge is still unstable
so I think we'll wait the night out here

50:48.697 --> 50:51.814
and then maybe
have a look-see tomorrow.

50:53.057 --> 50:54.456
The next morning,

50:54.497 --> 50:57.853
they pick their way
across broken tidal ice to the sleds,

50:57.897 --> 50:59.933
to check out the situation.

50:59.977 --> 51:04.050
I'm pleased that the hunters made
the decision they did, because overnight,

51:04.097 --> 51:07.851
we've lost three or four kilometres
of the ice shelf,

51:07.897 --> 51:11.606
which is now disappearing
rapidly in that direction.

51:13.297 --> 51:17.813
As we were coming into the fjord just now,
we actually crossed our tracks,

51:17.857 --> 51:22.647
and they disappeared off into the water,
which was quite a sobering thought.

51:24.897 --> 51:28.207
When they do reach the edge,
they can't believe their luck,

51:28.257 --> 51:30.691
as Mamarut quickly spots some narwhal.

51:33.137 --> 51:36.095
We've just seen some narwhal
further along the ice edge,

51:36.137 --> 51:39.049
so the guys are getting the kayaks ready

51:39.097 --> 51:43.807
because if the narwhals come close,
they might try to hunt them.

51:45.377 --> 51:47.766
Doug's ready to capture the action.

51:50.777 --> 51:55.976
But just when Gedion is in position
to harpoon, the narwhal dives.

52:00.657 --> 52:04.093
They wait and hope
for the whales to resurface.

52:05.577 --> 52:10.093
It's now one o'clock in the morning.
We've been here for about 1 2 hours.

52:10.137 --> 52:12.492
The narwhal have gone

52:12.537 --> 52:17.088
but the hunters are still pretty sure
that they're going to come back,

52:17.137 --> 52:21.210
and we're still waiting,
and we're all getting very tired.

52:24.897 --> 52:28.094
24-hour daylight
melts the ice from above,

52:28.137 --> 52:32.574
and ocean swells
stress the ice from beneath.

52:32.617 --> 52:35.575
It's not the safest place to camp,

52:35.617 --> 52:39.292
but they must wait at the edge
for the narwhals'return.

52:41.017 --> 52:46.330
The days start to run into weeks
and the crew have to extend their shoot.

52:47.657 --> 52:51.775
It's almost three weeks now
that we've been on location

52:51.817 --> 52:55.890
and this...this is the problem - ice.

52:55.937 --> 52:59.930
And somewhere under here are the narwhals.

52:59.977 --> 53:02.172
It's really frustrating.

53:04.857 --> 53:08.372
Next, it's the weather
that turns against them.

53:09.377 --> 53:13.416
It's just one thing
after another, isn't it?

53:16.137 --> 53:18.207
Oh!

53:21.497 --> 53:23.328
I'll tell you how bored I am.

53:23.377 --> 53:26.369
- How bored are you?
- I moved my tent this morning.

53:26.417 --> 53:29.409
That was the most exciting thing
I've done in three days.

53:29.457 --> 53:31.493
And I moved it six feet.

53:31.537 --> 53:35.325
But it kinda gave me a sense of
satisfaction, cos I'd done something!

53:38.417 --> 53:41.011
As the days pass, the temperature rises

53:41.057 --> 53:47.007
and the ice thins, increasing the chance
of something going wrong.

53:57.657 --> 54:00.410
Did you hear it? Did you hear it?
Oh, listen, listen!

54:00.457 --> 54:04.132
It's cracking... It's cracking
right underneath us right now.

54:04.177 --> 54:08.090
You can't see it cos there's snow
on top of it. There was like, "Crunch!"

54:11.777 --> 54:15.611
It's perfect narwhal conditions,
perfect light, perfect everything,

54:15.657 --> 54:18.125
and what's happening, we've got swell.

54:18.177 --> 54:21.135
The swell can fracture
the sea ice literally anywhere.

54:21.177 --> 54:27.173
That's not good news. So, it's time
to leave here and head to safer ground.

54:28.897 --> 54:31.855
The normally laid-back Inuit
up their pace,

54:31.897 --> 54:34.855
and the crew realise
the situation is serious.

54:34.897 --> 54:36.853
Go! Go!

54:38.577 --> 54:40.408
Gotta go.

54:58.737 --> 55:02.446
They are all now
cast adrift on an ice floe.

55:02.497 --> 55:06.251
I don't know how the hell
we're gonna get off this now!

55:08.097 --> 55:12.409
They're facing an emergency
and everyone's focus turns to survival.

55:14.217 --> 55:15.775
Stop this, please.

55:18.697 --> 55:24.135
The whole expedition is now
floating away at an alarming rate.

55:27.057 --> 55:32.450
There are 1 3 people, 54 dogs
and six sleds of kit to get to safety.

55:35.217 --> 55:37.572
Gedion has got into his canoe

55:37.617 --> 55:42.247
and is paddling furiously across the lead
with a very fine trace wire,

55:42.297 --> 55:45.812
onto which, by the looks of it,
they're going to put a much thicker rope,

55:45.857 --> 55:48.087
to physically haul from the other side
the sleds across,

55:48.137 --> 55:51.095
which is very clever,
cos they float - amazing.

55:52.897 --> 55:54.853
Speed is of the essence,

55:54.897 --> 55:58.936
as the wind blows the team
further and further from land.

55:58.977 --> 56:03.368
The sea temperature here
can kill in minutes.

56:05.297 --> 56:08.528
It pays not to rock the boat.

56:10.897 --> 56:13.616
Get the important stuff on!

56:13.657 --> 56:20.972
Well, the guys have done great. Very
impressed. No flap. They knew what to do.

56:21.017 --> 56:26.933
After four hours ferrying, the kit
and crew reach the other side safely.

56:28.177 --> 56:33.046
But that still leaves 54 water-shy dogs.

56:48.097 --> 56:51.089
On the other side,
they're still far from home

56:51.137 --> 56:54.049
and on ice that's breaking up around them.

56:56.297 --> 56:58.049
It's a race against time,

56:58.097 --> 57:02.090
as there's more than ten kilometres before
they reach the safety of the village.

57:04.097 --> 57:09.217
Within sight of home, an inexperienced
dog team makes a serious error.

57:19.897 --> 57:23.685
An unseen crack has opened up
just metres from the village.

57:25.177 --> 57:28.726
Any wider and the fully laden sledge
would sink to the bottom,

57:28.777 --> 57:30.768
dragging the dogs under.

57:33.857 --> 57:36.052
There's a dog trapped under the sledge

57:36.097 --> 57:40.807
but, miraculously,
even this one emerges unharmed.

57:42.817 --> 57:47.607
Doug and the rest of the crew spot
the problem and find a better route home.

57:50.177 --> 57:53.135
It was another week
before the ice was safe enough

57:53.177 --> 57:56.772
for the crew to film
the full narwhal hunt sequence.

57:57.777 --> 58:00.166
This shoot, more than any other,

58:00.217 --> 58:03.289
highlights the importance
of the complete trust

58:03.337 --> 58:07.012
between the Human Planet crew
and the local Inuit,

58:07.057 --> 58:11.926
in a place where knowing your environment
is the key to survival.
