Yes, I am.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.231

If he is nothing to you,

09:09.283 --> 09:10.882
he is nothing to me.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.951
Exactly.

09:12.953 --> 09:16.321

nothing to me,

09:16.323 --> 09:18.023
in an official sense.

09:18.025 --> 09:19.324
My journeys in
the New World

09:23.330 --> 09:25.230
Gideon's bonds
with France run deep.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.698
And he knows
Mary, Queen of Scots,

09:26.700 --> 09:28.166
better than almost anyone.

09:28.168 --> 09:31.236
Wise counsel
is protection.

09:31.238 --> 09:34.639
And if you love me,
don't you want to see me safe?

09:34.641 --> 09:36.675
Of course I do.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.209

09:41.014 --> 09:42.814
Lord Blackburn may stay.

09:42.816 --> 09:45.617
(quiet laugh)

10:00.634 --> 10:04.803
♪ ♪

10:25.692 --> 10:28.093
Do you like how
they look on you?

10:28.095 --> 10:30.629
I'll have you know,

10:30.631 --> 10:32.230
kings do wear jewels at times.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.765
I know what you're thinking,
"Not on their ears,

10:33.767 --> 10:35.400
they don't," but some do.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.369
Depends what country.

10:37.371 --> 10:39.638
And if you'd been anywhere
at all, you'd know that.

10:39.640 --> 10:42.140
Fact of the matter is...

10:42.142 --> 10:43.408
you wouldn't understand.

10:43.410 --> 10:46.144
Henri, wait, please.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.146
I should go. Best we aren't
seen leaving together.

10:49.716 --> 10:52.150
(sighs)

10:56.323 --> 10:57.722
Too skinny.

11:02.796 --> 11:05.764
Too equine.

11:07.901 --> 11:11.703
(snickers): Is that
King Philip in a wig?

11:11.705 --> 11:12.837
Your Grace, that's Lady Alina,

11:12.839 --> 11:14.372
second cousin
to the king of Spain.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.707
Adam's apple doesn't
fall too far

11:15.709 --> 11:17.442
from the tree, now, does it?

11:22.315 --> 11:23.948
We have been doing this
for days.

11:23.950 --> 11:26.284
These are Spain's finest
bridal candidates.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.420
Yet your son seems to find fault
in every one of them.

11:28.422 --> 11:31.256
Fear not, Charles
will choose one.

11:32.793 --> 11:33.858
(clears throat)

11:40.200 --> 11:43.168
You do realize what is
at stake here, do you not?

11:43.170 --> 11:44.969
Yes, yes, I'm well aware,
Mother.

11:44.971 --> 11:47.872
Then select one of these
marginally acceptable creatures,

11:47.874 --> 11:50.008
or risk losing
the backing of Spain,

11:50.010 --> 11:52.210
and your throne along with it!

11:59.019 --> 12:00.485
Is everything all right?

12:00.487 --> 12:03.354
More than all right.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.256
We've found one
of the conspirators.

12:05.258 --> 12:08.026
And you'll never believe
who turned him in.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.831
I'm truly grateful to you
for taking me in.

12:12.833 --> 12:16.735
I'm afraid I don't
touch the stuff anymore.

12:16.737 --> 12:20.105
I, too, have been evading
capture since that night.

12:20.107 --> 12:23.108
My own wife has
a bounty on my head.

12:23.110 --> 12:26.277
It's all very unsettling.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.747
Take him.
What?

12:28.749 --> 12:30.482
You...

12:30.484 --> 12:32.050
You Judas!

12:40.160 --> 12:41.993
Why did you turn him in?

12:41.995 --> 12:43.061
And if you lie to me,
I will have your head.

12:54.241 --> 12:56.541
I assure you I'm not
the same man that I was

12:56.543 --> 12:58.042
a few months ago.

12:58.044 --> 13:01.379
You do seem a bit
more clear-eyed.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.848
I've put all my
mistakes behind me.

13:03.850 --> 13:06.785
The drinking, the gambling,

13:06.787 --> 13:08.119
the whoring.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.455
I'm ashamed of how I behaved.

13:10.457 --> 13:13.291
I want you to know
how sorry I am.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.226
You have begged
my forgiveness before,

13:15.228 --> 13:18.129
and you have relapsed
every time.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.231
Why should I
show you mercy now?

13:20.233 --> 13:23.935
What you said that night
that we escaped.

13:23.937 --> 13:28.306
John Knox was using me,
preying on my weaknesses,

13:28.308 --> 13:30.275
my lust for power.

13:30.277 --> 13:33.111
But I no longer harbor
such ambitions.

13:33.113 --> 13:36.981
They died that night
in a flash of blades.

13:36.983 --> 13:39.284
When I saw what
the privy council...
Don't.

13:39.286 --> 13:42.887
It's not what I wanted.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.157
And I know that
I'm not what you want.

13:46.159 --> 13:49.894
Your heart belongs
to another.

13:49.896 --> 13:51.162
I want you to be happy.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.932
And what do you want in return?

13:56.203 --> 13:58.169
A chance to know my child.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.470
Nothing more.

13:59.472 --> 14:03.308
All these months,
running, hiding,

14:03.310 --> 14:05.210
the only thing I could
think about was how

14:05.212 --> 14:08.379
I would not have a chance to
be a part of our child's life.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.548
To show my love,
and be loved in return,

14:10.550 --> 14:11.983
that's all I want.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.451
Allow me to prove it to you.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.555
Prove it by helping me find

14:17.557 --> 14:19.390
the remaining
privy council members,

14:19.392 --> 14:22.393
so I can force them
to testify against Knox.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.263
BOTHWELL:
<i> The man is a traitor.</i>

14:25.265 --> 14:27.165
No, it's too risky.

14:27.167 --> 14:29.167
Your life and your Crown
are in constant danger

14:29.169 --> 14:30.435
so long as
Darnley walks free.

14:30.437 --> 14:33.171
I need the testimony
from the privy council

14:33.173 --> 14:35.540
to prove that Knox
was behind the coup.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.408
Darnley will lead us to them.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.544
And then we arrest them all.

14:39.546 --> 14:43.181
Including King Darnley.

14:46.152 --> 14:48.152
A mild storm delayed
our crossing,

14:48.154 --> 14:50.121
damaged the ship's
gunwales on arrival.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.257
The repairs took
an extra three days,

14:52.259 --> 14:54.225
but the mission yielded
the hybrid tulips

14:54.227 --> 14:56.494
you'd apparently
requested.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.563
In Prague,
I represented England

14:58.565 --> 15:01.165
at a three-year-old's
birthday party...

15:01.167 --> 15:04.002
Each mission more important
than you might realize.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.304
Are you pale with anger

15:06.306 --> 15:07.639
or unwell?

15:07.641 --> 15:09.207
I'm a bit of both, I'm afraid,

15:09.209 --> 15:11.242
thanks to all this
pointless travel.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.548
Look, you sent me on one
fool's errand after another,

15:17.550 --> 15:19.284
and I think I know why.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.286
It's your fiancé.

15:21.288 --> 15:22.520
Does the archduke know about us?

15:22.522 --> 15:24.956
(laughs): No.
Are you sure?

15:24.958 --> 15:26.190
Because I won't let
my feelings for you

15:26.192 --> 15:27.358
put your realm in danger.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.093
You need this marriage.

15:29.095 --> 15:32.263
I admit that if I kept you
chained to my side,

15:32.265 --> 15:35.066
the archduke might
suspect something.

15:35.068 --> 15:37.235
I noticed you were careful
to leave the door open.

15:37.237 --> 15:38.536
To avoid gossip.

15:38.538 --> 15:41.973
I'm protecting us.

15:41.975 --> 15:45.576
Come to my chambers tonight.

15:45.578 --> 15:48.546
There, the door will be closed,

15:48.548 --> 15:51.582
and I promise
to thank you properly

15:51.584 --> 15:54.385
for your journeys for the Crown.

15:56.990 --> 16:00.058
You asked for me, Mother?

16:00.060 --> 16:02.126
Yes.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.297
Luc.

16:06.299 --> 16:09.067
I... I didn't know
you were back

16:09.069 --> 16:10.368
from your estates.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.536
I apologize.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.604
I should've sent word
that I was coming.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.239
CATHERINE: Your husband Luc
has informed me

16:15.241 --> 16:17.208
of a most unfortunate
situation.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.643
An illicit meeting.

16:18.645 --> 16:21.412
An affair between
Nicole and Henri.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.348
Henri and Nicole?

16:23.350 --> 16:24.682
It can't be.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.250
It would break Charles' heart.

16:26.252 --> 16:27.518
That's why I sent for you,
my dear.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.720
You know your brothers
better than anyone.

16:28.722 --> 16:30.421
They both adore you.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.256
Do you think that Charles
suspects anything?

16:32.258 --> 16:33.458
Absolutely not.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.093
Charles is deeply
in love with Nicole,

16:35.095 --> 16:36.661
and he is quite certain
that she feels the same.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.697
Then I fear Charles will snap
if he learns the truth.

16:39.699 --> 16:42.367
And with the new
promise of Spain's backing,

16:42.369 --> 16:45.236
he will feel free
to take revenge.

16:45.238 --> 16:46.337
I have to stop this madness,

16:46.339 --> 16:49.207
before one of my sons
kills the other.

16:49.209 --> 16:52.543
You must convince Henri to end
this tryst with Nicole.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.278
Of course.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.381
Take Luc with you.

16:56.383 --> 16:57.348
Why him?
Why me?

16:57.350 --> 16:59.450
Because you are a good man

16:59.452 --> 17:01.019
who speaks from the heart.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.587
Do you remember how
you convinced Charles

17:02.589 --> 17:04.522
to return to Catholicism?

17:04.524 --> 17:07.425
And in so doing,
you saved his life.

17:07.427 --> 17:11.062
I only hope you can
save Henri's as well.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.534
(clears throat)

17:21.141 --> 17:22.273
Well, hello there,
Lord Blackburn.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.375
Where are you off to?

17:24.377 --> 17:27.345
I was on my way
to a friend's chambers.

17:27.347 --> 17:28.780
To celebrate your return, eh?

17:28.782 --> 17:31.449
Hmm.
Must be a good friend.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.418
Mm, and you're here...

17:33.420 --> 17:35.219
reading.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.321
Well, killing time.

17:37.323 --> 17:39.323
Waiting to surprise
Elizabeth.

17:39.325 --> 17:40.591
I was told she retired
to her chambers

17:40.593 --> 17:42.060
nearly an hour ago.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.796
It takes her some time
to undress.

17:44.798 --> 17:47.398
Ah.

17:47.400 --> 17:51.235
You're shocked by my night
visit, I can see that.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.171
Well, Elizabeth may be shocked.

17:53.173 --> 17:56.140
Or would be, if you made it
past her guards.

17:56.142 --> 17:58.142
Oh, she dismisses her guards
right after her maids.

17:58.144 --> 18:00.078
But I shouldn't be
telling you that, should I?

18:00.080 --> 18:02.346
Except she has told me

18:02.348 --> 18:04.849
what a trusted servant you are.

18:04.851 --> 18:07.251
She even pleaded
with me to let you stay

18:07.253 --> 18:08.719
after she'd sent you
all over Christendom,

18:08.721 --> 18:10.154
because I was jealous.

18:10.156 --> 18:11.556
Baseless,
of course.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.224
She made sure I knew

18:13.226 --> 18:15.560
I was the only man
she wanted.

18:15.562 --> 18:19.564
And Elizabeth can be
very reassuring.

18:25.872 --> 18:28.473
I waited for you.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.441
Why did you not come for me?

18:30.443 --> 18:32.110
I was told you already
had a guest.

18:32.112 --> 18:33.444
Another guest?

18:33.446 --> 18:35.780
Mm-hmm.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.248
Who told you?

18:37.250 --> 18:39.450
Your fiancé.
No, no, your lover,

18:39.452 --> 18:40.618
the archduke.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.487
He caught me on my
way to your room.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.455
He was waiting to be
entertained by you as well.

18:44.457 --> 18:47.425
"Reassured," he called it.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.560
Gideon, I had to.
Oh, did he force you?

18:49.562 --> 18:50.761
He is to be my husband.

18:50.763 --> 18:53.531
He isn't your husband yet!

18:53.533 --> 18:56.434
You assured me that
this union was merely

18:56.436 --> 18:58.336
for political reasons,
for your safety.

18:58.338 --> 18:59.804
You said it was
for my survival.

18:59.806 --> 19:03.441
You told me yourself this
marriage was a necessity.

19:03.443 --> 19:04.642
But you are
sleeping with him

19:04.644 --> 19:07.211
in advance of it;
a risk in and of itself.

19:07.213 --> 19:08.513
I mean,
why would you take it?

19:08.515 --> 19:10.748
To protect us!
To make him think I love him

19:10.750 --> 19:12.583
and not you!

19:12.585 --> 19:15.219
(scoffs)

19:15.221 --> 19:16.821
You lie to him,
you lie to me...

19:16.823 --> 19:18.422
Because if you knew
he suspected,

19:18.424 --> 19:20.525
you would end things with me.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.727
And I can't bear to lose you.

19:22.729 --> 19:24.629
Our affair puts you in danger.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.297
I don't care.
I do!

19:26.299 --> 19:28.366
I mean, why risk so much
with this affair

19:28.368 --> 19:29.700
when you'll eventually
tire of it?

19:29.702 --> 19:33.437
I won't ever tire of you.

19:33.439 --> 19:34.906
You're so clever.

19:34.908 --> 19:37.308
Your lies come so easily.

19:37.310 --> 19:38.776
In time, you'll think
less of even me

19:38.778 --> 19:39.944
for believing them.

19:39.946 --> 19:42.847
You've put a sea
between us.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.415
You didn't have to send me
to a three-year-old's

19:44.417 --> 19:46.284
birthday party
in Prague to do it.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.488
We're finished, Your Majesty.

19:51.624 --> 19:52.690
I don't want any part of you.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.503
I do hope you'll forgive me
for arriving unannounced,

20:05.505 --> 20:06.504
Queen Mary.

20:06.506 --> 20:07.738
Why are you here?

20:07.740 --> 20:10.274
I've come for revenge, for Lola.

20:10.276 --> 20:13.444
I want to take what
John Knox holds most dear.

20:13.446 --> 20:16.214
Catherine told me you saw.

20:16.216 --> 20:18.282
That you were there at the end.

20:18.284 --> 20:21.352
I'm thankful Lola wasn't alone.

20:23.623 --> 20:26.557
Knox will pay for his sins--

20:26.559 --> 20:28.226
for Lola and many others--

20:28.228 --> 20:29.811
but not by your hand.

20:29.812 --> 20:31.395
His followers would be
quick to blame me

20:31.397 --> 20:33.731
if he were to die or disappear
under mysterious circumstances.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.234
I can assure you, there will be
no repercussions for your Crown.

20:36.236 --> 20:38.436
Catherine was very clear,
insistent upon it.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.438
But when Knox
plotted a coup

20:40.440 --> 20:42.306
with your privy council,

20:42.308 --> 20:45.276
she felt that
my desire for revenge

20:45.278 --> 20:46.544
could be of service.

20:46.546 --> 20:47.878
Revenge you have

20:47.880 --> 20:50.281
waited very patiently for,
it seems.

20:50.283 --> 20:51.382
Yes.

20:51.384 --> 20:52.550
Like all matters of importance,

20:52.552 --> 20:53.985
it takes careful planning.

20:53.987 --> 20:57.021
But now, all of the
pieces are in place.

20:57.023 --> 21:00.891
I ask only for your consent.

21:03.563 --> 21:04.629
No.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.564
Justice cannot be seen

21:06.566 --> 21:08.566
as personal retribution.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.368
I already have a plan in motion

21:10.370 --> 21:13.537
to convict John Knox
in a court of law.

21:13.539 --> 21:15.406
He will hang.

21:15.408 --> 21:18.309
And I will enjoy
watching him die.

21:20.913 --> 21:23.714
(laughter)

21:26.019 --> 21:28.552
Oh!
(giggling

21:28.554 --> 21:31.555
Can you come back
tomorrow?

21:31.557 --> 21:33.391
It's quite a trip
to get here.

21:34.427 --> 21:36.527
How did you find this place?

21:36.529 --> 21:38.729
I knew you'd never
give up Sophia.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.598
Did you lead him here?
I'm sorry...

21:40.600 --> 21:41.866
You'll thank her
once you hear

21:41.868 --> 21:43.367
Elizabeth's offer.

21:43.369 --> 21:45.303
Elizabeth's willing
to grant safe harbor

21:45.305 --> 21:47.705
to all involved in
the coup attempt.

21:47.707 --> 21:49.740
All we need to do
is cross the border.

21:49.742 --> 21:52.510
Once on English soil,
we'll be protected from Mary

21:52.512 --> 21:54.712
and restored to a more...

21:54.714 --> 21:57.782
acceptable lifestyle
for men of our birth.

21:57.784 --> 22:00.384
Why would she agree to that?

22:00.386 --> 22:02.620
Because she wants Mary
removed from the throne

22:02.622 --> 22:04.322
as much as we do,

22:04.324 --> 22:05.723
and an alliance
with the Scottish king

22:05.725 --> 22:07.591
and the privy council in exile

22:07.593 --> 22:09.960
will prove
a powerful political weapon

22:09.962 --> 22:13.064
in the inevitable
"War of Two Queens."

22:13.066 --> 22:14.665
A ready-made government.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.367
Exactly, which is
why she wants

22:16.369 --> 22:17.968
as many of the
dispersed council

22:17.970 --> 22:19.770
as possible to join us.

22:19.772 --> 22:21.939
I have no way to reach them.

22:21.941 --> 22:24.342
But I'm certain you can.

22:24.344 --> 22:26.377
And if I do, what then?

22:26.379 --> 22:28.346
I present Elizabeth's offer.

22:28.348 --> 22:30.481
Those that accept
leave for England at once.

22:30.483 --> 22:31.615
It's too risky.

22:31.617 --> 22:33.484
I know you don't
trust Elizabeth--

22:33.486 --> 22:35.486
I don't trust you.

22:35.488 --> 22:36.787
Fine!

22:36.789 --> 22:38.689
Get by on your own.
A wanted man,

22:38.691 --> 22:40.825
living in constant fear,
with no servants,

22:40.827 --> 22:42.860
money or power.

22:42.862 --> 22:45.496
Or come to England,
live a dignified life,

22:45.498 --> 22:47.365
and then return
with Elizabeth's armies,

22:47.367 --> 22:49.433
to claim back what we've lost.

22:50.903 --> 22:53.371
Can you contact the councilmen

22:53.373 --> 22:55.506
and have them here by tonight?

22:55.508 --> 22:56.841
Yes.

22:56.843 --> 22:58.809
Good. I'll return
at midnight.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.911
We'll be in England before dawn.

23:03.516 --> 23:05.750
Nicole's a pretty enough girl,
but it's clear

23:05.752 --> 23:08.052
the affair has nothing
to do with her.

23:08.054 --> 23:11.122
You're using her as a pawn
in this rivalry with Charles.

23:11.124 --> 23:13.157
LUC: Now that Charles
has Spanish support,

23:13.159 --> 23:15.626
your ambitions to his throne
have no chance of success.

23:15.628 --> 23:16.827
All right, fine.

23:16.829 --> 23:18.829
Despite what you think,
I care about you.

23:18.831 --> 23:21.599
And I won't let you endanger
yourself for no reason.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.434
I'm saying you're right.
I'll end it.

23:23.436 --> 23:26.637
I only started sleeping with
Nicole to unsettle Charles,

23:26.639 --> 23:29.407
but without Spain's backing, I
can't even throw it in his face.

23:29.409 --> 23:32.143
As you said, it's unwise.

23:32.145 --> 23:34.578
Besides, I was about
to end things anyway.

23:34.580 --> 23:37.415
She's getting too attached.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.583
Are we done here?

23:40.153 --> 23:41.986
Yes.

23:46.459 --> 23:49.026
Well, that was easy.

23:49.028 --> 23:50.761
Yeah.

23:50.763 --> 23:54.465
Well, give your mother
my best.

23:54.467 --> 23:56.801
Oh, you don't have to leave.

23:56.803 --> 23:58.669
It's just that...

23:58.671 --> 24:00.871
it's been incredibly dull
here, and I...

24:00.873 --> 24:02.673
You'll be fine.
I've missed you.

24:02.675 --> 24:04.675
Perhaps that's
reason enough

24:04.677 --> 24:09.513
for you to stop being
an ass and stay for the party.

24:09.515 --> 24:15.119
(chuckles)

24:15.121 --> 24:17.521
BOTHWELL: The hunting lodge
has been burned.

24:17.523 --> 24:19.457
DARNLEY:
There's no way the privy council

24:19.459 --> 24:22.026
could have escaped
from this fire.

24:22.028 --> 24:24.562
The door.

24:24.564 --> 24:25.796
The windows, too.

24:25.798 --> 24:28.232
All locked from the outside.

24:28.234 --> 24:30.201
He must have learned
of the meeting.

24:30.203 --> 24:32.670
Knox burned these men alive.

24:34.607 --> 24:38.776
Now, no one can testify
to his part in the coup.

24:38.778 --> 24:40.544
I'm certain it was Darnley.

24:40.546 --> 24:42.913
Not that it's impossible for
Knox to have discovered the plan

24:42.915 --> 24:44.582
and killed the
Council, but...

24:44.584 --> 24:46.717
But Darnley had
the exact same motive.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.719
And he knew the location
of the meeting,

24:48.721 --> 24:50.054
the privy council members
know him

24:50.056 --> 24:51.822
and he had plenty of time
to do it.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.224
And don't forget
his history of setting fires

24:53.226 --> 24:54.625
in order to get what he wants.

24:54.627 --> 24:55.926
Where is he now?

24:55.928 --> 24:57.228
I brought him back
to the castle.

24:57.230 --> 24:58.996
I couldn't risk him
disappearing again.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.264
Mary.

25:00.266 --> 25:03.167
Your husband
is a threat to you.

25:03.169 --> 25:05.503
What do you want me
to do about him?

25:07.607 --> 25:08.672
I'm the King of Scotland!

25:28.928 --> 25:29.593
Am I interrupting?

25:29.595 --> 25:31.161
No.

25:31.163 --> 25:33.998
Actually, I was hoping
we could talk.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.165
Nicole, I've been thinking...

25:35.167 --> 25:36.166
Mind if I start?

25:36.168 --> 25:37.601
If you wish.

25:37.603 --> 25:38.669
(sighs)

25:38.671 --> 25:40.604
My comments at the inn

25:40.606 --> 25:43.107
caught you off guard,
and I'm sorry for that.

25:43.109 --> 25:46.043
But when I woke and saw
you trying on my earrings,

25:46.045 --> 25:48.178
I... At the time...

25:48.180 --> 25:51.181
it's something I've wanted to
talk to you about for a while.

25:51.183 --> 25:54.118
What I mean is it
wasn't the first time

25:54.120 --> 25:56.020
I'd seen you with my jewelry.

25:57.657 --> 26:01.292
I've also seen...
marks on your chest.

26:01.294 --> 26:03.861
The kind of marks

26:03.863 --> 26:07.164
caused by wearing... a corset.

26:07.166 --> 26:08.299
What of it?

26:08.301 --> 26:09.833
Yes,

26:09.835 --> 26:12.002
I enjoy wearing women's
clothing on occasion.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.704
Jewelry, corsets,
and the like.

26:13.706 --> 26:14.805
Is that what you wanted to know?

26:14.807 --> 26:16.640
Uh, kind of, but...

26:16.642 --> 26:18.242
I don't want
to be a woman.

26:18.244 --> 26:20.210
Sometimes, I think
wearing their clothes

26:20.212 --> 26:23.881
lets me inhabit them
more completely.

26:23.883 --> 26:27.217
But the truth is I don't know
where the desire comes from.

26:27.219 --> 26:28.819
It just is.

26:28.821 --> 26:30.921
And though I have
to hide it

26:30.923 --> 26:35.225
from narrow minds, I won't deny
myself the feeling it brings.

26:35.227 --> 26:39.797
Power, excitement, pleasure.

26:39.799 --> 26:42.900
Liberation from a world
determined to tell me who to be.

26:42.902 --> 26:45.769
I am who I am.
I want what I want.

26:45.771 --> 26:48.072
And I take what I want.

26:48.074 --> 26:49.773
If that scares you,
if it repels you,

26:49.775 --> 26:51.642
then you're with the wrong man.

26:55.681 --> 26:56.981
Mm.

27:01.153 --> 27:04.321
I have something for you.

27:10.329 --> 27:11.762
(laughs)

27:19.238 --> 27:20.838
I suppose you have
some questions.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.007
Do you remember your first time?

27:23.009 --> 27:24.708
A chemise that I stole
from my father's mistress.

27:24.710 --> 27:25.709
Do you have a favorite piece
to wear?

27:25.711 --> 27:26.777
I love you, too.

27:32.084 --> 27:33.917
Claude and my mother
know about us.

27:33.919 --> 27:35.419
Told me to break it off.

27:35.421 --> 27:36.720
If Charles were to find out...

27:36.722 --> 27:38.689
I'll take care of your brother.

27:40.026 --> 27:41.258
But first...

27:48.167 --> 27:50.034
Nicole.

27:50.036 --> 27:51.201
There you are.

27:51.203 --> 27:53.037
Feel like I haven't
seen you in ages.

27:53.039 --> 27:55.305
You've been rather busy.

27:55.307 --> 27:57.207
Are you enjoying your search
for a Spanish bride?

27:57.209 --> 27:58.909
It's been awful.

27:58.911 --> 28:01.812
Each candidate is more boring
than the last.

28:01.814 --> 28:03.280
Hey, come to my chambers
tonight.

28:03.282 --> 28:05.349
I'm not sure I should.

28:05.351 --> 28:07.184
Uh, this marriage...

28:07.186 --> 28:08.986
it's is a political
necessity.

28:08.988 --> 28:10.220
And you have
no choice

28:10.222 --> 28:12.156
if you want peace with Spain.

28:12.158 --> 28:15.993
As king, you must put France
before your heart. I understand.

28:15.995 --> 28:18.162
But I'm still just a girl.

28:18.164 --> 28:20.798
Knowing that the man I love
will be with another woman,

28:20.800 --> 28:23.033
it... it's just too painful.

28:23.035 --> 28:25.135
I know this is difficult, but...

28:25.137 --> 28:27.805
I just need some time.

I would never give you up.

30:59.358 --> 31:03.060
He would trade your life for
his in an instant, Mary.

31:03.062 --> 31:04.361
Would he?

31:04.363 --> 31:07.898
I know he wants power,
and his ego is monstrous,

31:07.900 --> 31:11.134
but he is still my husband
and the father of my child.

31:12.571 --> 31:14.872
Continue to interrogate him,

31:14.874 --> 31:16.273
but do not harm him.

31:16.275 --> 31:17.875
For now.

31:24.350 --> 31:26.550
I'm afraid you will
have to return to France

31:26.552 --> 31:28.418
without seeing Knox hang.

31:28.420 --> 31:30.888
Your plan didn't work, then.

31:30.890 --> 31:34.024
I'm sorry.
But it seems Reverend Knox

31:34.026 --> 31:37.494
has, uh, escaped justice
once again.

31:43.435 --> 31:45.235
NARCISSE:
Save your strength, Reverend.

31:45.237 --> 31:47.004
(grunts)

31:47.006 --> 31:49.206
KNOX: Who are
you? Release me!

31:49.208 --> 31:51.475
Or there will
be consequences!

31:51.477 --> 31:53.343
If I've wronged you in some way,

31:53.345 --> 31:55.345
I can make
it right.

31:55.347 --> 31:57.381
No.

31:57.383 --> 31:59.149
You can't.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.986
Narcisse.

32:02.988 --> 32:05.589
(inhaling, exhaling)

32:05.591 --> 32:07.190
Please.

32:07.192 --> 32:09.493
Let me go.

32:09.495 --> 32:12.629
Lola... was just a pawn

32:12.631 --> 32:15.065
in your political schemes.

32:15.067 --> 32:18.001
Her death,
a mere byproduct.

32:18.003 --> 32:19.603
But I loved her,

32:19.605 --> 32:21.471
more than life itself,

32:21.473 --> 32:24.574
and I was forced to stand
and watch helplessly,

32:24.576 --> 32:27.577
as they killed her
before my very eyes.

32:27.579 --> 32:29.446
I thought you might
learn this lesson

32:29.448 --> 32:31.481
at the end of a rope, but...

32:31.483 --> 32:34.351
it appears that
I must teach you.

32:34.353 --> 32:37.120
There are consequences,
taking from a man

32:37.122 --> 32:39.356
that which he holds most dear.

32:39.358 --> 32:41.591
It was Elizabeth!
She's to blame.

32:41.593 --> 32:44.027
Elizabeth ordered the execution!

32:44.029 --> 32:47.597
Everyone will pay...

32:47.599 --> 32:49.599
in their own way.

32:49.601 --> 32:51.635
(grunting)

32:51.637 --> 32:53.704
(shouting)

33:00.379 --> 33:01.611
GIDEON:
Where are you going?

33:01.613 --> 33:02.646
ELIZABETH:
A stroll.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.314
Please, don't tell me

33:04.316 --> 33:05.449
you want to go back
to the castle already.

33:05.451 --> 33:07.184
(coughs)

33:07.186 --> 33:09.319
(groans)

33:09.321 --> 33:10.587
Gideon?

33:10.589 --> 33:12.356
(groans)

33:12.358 --> 33:14.191
Are feeling unwell again?

33:14.193 --> 33:17.027
(coughs, sniffles)

33:18.230 --> 33:20.464
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

33:20.466 --> 33:23.133
Gideon! Gideon.

33:23.135 --> 33:25.502
Come on, get help.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.604
Where?

33:27.606 --> 33:29.039
(crying)

33:29.041 --> 33:33.410
Stay with me, wife.
We are bound.

33:33.412 --> 33:34.678
(groaning)

33:37.583 --> 33:39.282
(crying)

33:40.753 --> 33:42.019
(crying): No!

34:04.610 --> 34:08.412
I do hope the reception's to
your liking, Ambassador Franco.

34:08.414 --> 34:10.064
So tasteful.

34:10.065 --> 34:11.715
I'd heard such tales of
depravity in French court.

34:11.717 --> 34:13.383
If only we could
enjoy the festivities

34:13.385 --> 34:15.719
without all this bridal
business hanging over us.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.521
I do hope King Charles
makes his choice soon.

34:17.523 --> 34:20.157
Very soon, I'm sure.

34:20.159 --> 34:25.829
I nearly forgot to ask about
your study of astronomy.

34:25.831 --> 34:28.198
Yes. Claude, too,
she's a lover of the stars.

34:28.200 --> 34:30.700
Ah, the night sky.

34:30.702 --> 34:32.369
God's most
magnificent creation.

34:32.371 --> 34:34.805
Wouldn't you agree, Princess?

34:34.807 --> 34:36.673
Uh, apologies, Ambassador,

34:36.675 --> 34:39.810
but I promised
my husband a dance.

34:43.749 --> 34:47.651
I like being close
to you like this.

34:47.653 --> 34:49.219
It's all I've ever wanted.

34:51.457 --> 34:53.690
Claude.

34:53.692 --> 34:55.292
It doesn't have to end.

34:59.798 --> 35:01.298
I'm-I'm sorry.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.699
I'm sorry, I...

35:03.769 --> 35:05.268
...I have to go.

35:14.780 --> 35:17.814
You want me to support
your annulment?

35:17.816 --> 35:19.549
But you love Claude.

35:19.551 --> 35:22.586
And I've been holding out hope
she could love me, too.

35:22.588 --> 35:23.820
I know she likes you.

35:23.822 --> 35:24.855
You look happy together.

35:24.857 --> 35:26.323
And feelings do change.

35:26.325 --> 35:28.325
If only it were that simple.

35:28.327 --> 35:30.127
She can't let me
into her heart

35:30.129 --> 35:33.730
because her heart
still belongs to Leith.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.866
As much as I want
to be with her,

35:35.868 --> 35:38.368
I won't stand in her way.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.639
Claude should be
with the man she loves.

35:42.641 --> 35:45.675
Of course.

35:45.677 --> 35:47.177
You're so right.

35:56.788 --> 35:59.856
(laughs)
So sweet of you...

35:59.858 --> 36:02.492
CHARLES:
I have important news.

36:02.494 --> 36:05.362
Tonight, I will be announcing
my bride-to-be.

36:08.634 --> 36:11.301
But before I reveal my choice,

36:11.303 --> 36:13.170
I would like
to thank Luc Narcisse,

36:13.172 --> 36:14.337
a good man,

36:14.339 --> 36:15.839
a wise man,

36:15.841 --> 36:17.908
and the best brother-in-law
a man could ask for.

36:17.910 --> 36:19.910
Thank you, Luc.
Your words have brought me

36:19.912 --> 36:22.212
the strength and wisdom
I needed.

36:22.214 --> 36:25.749
And now, the love of my life

36:25.751 --> 36:27.918
and the new queen of France.

36:27.920 --> 36:30.353
Nicole de...

36:31.356 --> 36:32.756
...what's your last name again?

36:32.758 --> 36:33.890
I've never thought to ask.

36:33.892 --> 36:36.259
I've-I've always thought
of her as mine,

36:36.261 --> 36:38.228
and now she belongs
to France, too.

36:38.230 --> 36:39.930
Come, Nicole, join me.

36:39.932 --> 36:41.665
Come.

36:48.207 --> 36:49.206
I can make him see reason.

36:49.208 --> 36:50.473
Spain is quite finished

36:50.475 --> 36:52.509
with you and
your hopeless brood!

37:04.223 --> 37:06.556
Your Majesty?

37:06.558 --> 37:07.924
Elizabeth?

37:07.926 --> 37:09.893
He was poisoned.

37:09.895 --> 37:12.262
It had to be.

37:12.264 --> 37:13.730
We have to go.

37:13.732 --> 37:16.733
I can't leave him...
not like this.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.868
You can't be found
with him, either.

37:18.870 --> 37:20.704
I sent a note
to the nearest physician,

37:20.706 --> 37:23.740
claiming I'd come across...
a body.

37:23.742 --> 37:26.309
I didn't sign it,
but they'll be here soon.

37:26.311 --> 37:29.246
He won't be left for long,
but you must leave.

37:30.582 --> 37:33.683
He'd want you to be safe.

37:33.685 --> 37:35.385
He loved you.

37:39.491 --> 37:44.728
♪ Mm, we say... ♪

37:44.730 --> 37:47.764
I will find
who did this to you,

37:47.766 --> 37:49.733
and when I do...

37:49.735 --> 37:53.903
they will know
how much I love you.

37:53.905 --> 37:59.409
♪ Ah-Amen ♪

38:00.345 --> 38:05.815
♪ Ah, amen. ♪

38:10.589 --> 38:12.422
(door opens)

38:12.424 --> 38:15.292
Lord Narcisse, I'm surprised
to still see you here.

38:15.294 --> 38:18.628
It could be some time
until John Knox

38:18.630 --> 38:20.664
is brought to justice,
but I assure you,

38:20.666 --> 38:23.867
I will not give up
until Lola is avenged.

38:25.937 --> 38:31.641
Before I left, I wanted
to give you a parting gift.

38:31.643 --> 38:35.712
You are still free to take your
legal steps against John Knox,

38:35.714 --> 38:38.648
but I've taken
what he valued the most,

38:38.650 --> 38:40.684
the thing that made him a man.

38:43.021 --> 38:46.022
(gasps)

38:46.024 --> 38:47.991
Are those his--?
Yes.

38:47.993 --> 38:49.626
Is he d--?
Very much alive.

38:49.628 --> 38:51.561
I didn't kill him,

38:51.563 --> 38:53.697
but justice needed to be done.

38:53.699 --> 38:54.798
You're a monster.

38:54.800 --> 38:55.999
No.

38:56.001 --> 38:57.400
Just a man.

38:57.402 --> 39:00.837
One who wanted revenge.

39:00.839 --> 39:03.473
As did you, if I recall.

39:03.475 --> 39:06.109
This vile act
will not ease your pain!

39:06.111 --> 39:09.045
Mary, revenge is not meant
to ease pain.

39:09.047 --> 39:11.648
It is meant
to balance the scales.

39:11.650 --> 39:14.684
I will live with the
pain of Lola's death

39:14.686 --> 39:16.553
for the rest of
my life, but now,

39:16.555 --> 39:19.589
I have made sure that
everyone responsible for it

39:19.591 --> 39:23.560
will forever
suffer pain, too.

39:23.562 --> 39:25.428
Everyone?

39:25.430 --> 39:27.630
I heard Gideon
was poisoned.

39:27.632 --> 39:29.733
It was you, wasn't it?

39:31.603 --> 39:34.104
You killed Gideon Blackburn.

39:34.106 --> 39:35.972
Yes.

39:35.974 --> 39:37.140
He was an innocent man!

39:37.142 --> 39:39.776
Gideon didn't
deserve his fate...

39:39.778 --> 39:41.044
but Elizabeth did.

39:41.046 --> 39:43.580
She loved Gideon,
deeply,

39:43.582 --> 39:45.148
with all her
heart, and now,

39:45.150 --> 39:48.418
she knows what it feels like

39:48.420 --> 39:51.521
to lose the one
she loved the most.

39:51.523 --> 39:53.089
So...

39:53.091 --> 39:55.458
the scales are balanced.

39:55.460 --> 39:56.726
Get out.

39:57.963 --> 39:59.529
Get out of my court.

39:59.531 --> 40:02.065
Get out of my country!
Get out!

40:04.603 --> 40:06.770
Mary. What's the matter?

40:06.772 --> 40:07.971
It was him, Narcisse.

40:07.973 --> 40:08.972
He's the one
who killed Gideon,

40:08.974 --> 40:11.174
and this is his revenge

40:11.176 --> 40:12.142
on John Knox.

40:12.144 --> 40:14.677
He castrated him.

40:14.679 --> 40:16.679
I can't keep
living like this,

40:16.681 --> 40:19.682
trapped in this endless cycle

40:19.684 --> 40:21.718
of bitterness and revenge.

40:21.720 --> 40:25.755
I need to find peace
in my country, in my life...

40:28.627 --> 40:30.627
...even in my marriage.

40:30.629 --> 40:32.061
Mary, no.

40:32.063 --> 40:33.129
I'm sorry,

40:33.131 --> 40:34.697
but I have to let go

40:34.699 --> 40:37.200
of this desire for revenge

40:37.202 --> 40:41.104
before everyone I love
drowns in a pool of blood...

40:44.643 --> 40:47.076
...even if that means
we can't be together.

40:48.647 --> 40:51.548
Darnley must go free.

40:54.853 --> 40:57.187
(knocking)

40:57.189 --> 40:58.988
Mother.

40:58.990 --> 41:01.691
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
Have you been well?

41:01.693 --> 41:05.762
I've not been in a dungeon,
as you have.

41:05.764 --> 41:08.198
With cousins in the countryside,
weren't you?

41:08.200 --> 41:09.532
Uh, yes.

41:09.534 --> 41:11.601
Darnley...

41:11.603 --> 41:14.037
they say you have taken part
in a coup.

41:14.039 --> 41:16.940
It got... out of hand.

41:16.942 --> 41:18.775
I was a part of it,
and then I was arrested

41:18.777 --> 41:21.578
for killing members
of the privy council,

41:21.580 --> 41:24.814
but without witnesses for either
crime, nothing can be proven.

41:26.084 --> 41:27.984
I took care of it.

41:27.986 --> 41:31.087
Please tell me that
you didn't burn those men.

41:31.089 --> 41:36.926
I didn't want to at first,
but... she convinced me

41:36.928 --> 41:39.095
that it was the only way
to protect myself.

41:39.097 --> 41:41.498
She? Who convinced you?

41:41.500 --> 41:42.765
Keira.

41:42.767 --> 41:44.000
She's been very helpful.

41:45.770 --> 41:48.605
She's more intelligent than
you ever gave her credit for.

41:48.607 --> 41:51.808
Keira?
K-Keira is dead.

41:51.810 --> 41:53.610
Ah, shh.

41:53.612 --> 41:57.180
She was gone, but now she's back
so that we can be together.

41:58.783 --> 41:59.849
Like we were always meant to be.
