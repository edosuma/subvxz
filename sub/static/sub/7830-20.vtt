aren't home, are they?

09:04.210 --> 09:06.212
No. They went for a walk

Bart, what's going on? Why are those
repo guys taking all your stuff?

09:09.298 --> 09:11.008

a credit card and--

09:11.092 --> 09:14.595
Credit card? Oh, I knew you were
up to no good.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.806

a little mail fraud.

punished enough?

09:18.849 --> 09:21.269

the bassinet,

09:21.352 --> 09:22.728

is one $1,200 dog.

-Is that him?

I didn't plan this.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.423

10:21.370 --> 10:22.913

10:22.997 --> 10:24.373
Do you think he noticed?

10:24.457 --> 10:27.668
(grumbling)

10:27.752 --> 10:29.462
Where's Santa's Little Helper?

10:29.545 --> 10:30.546
Who?

10:30.630 --> 10:32.590
Um, I took him to a kennel...

10:32.673 --> 10:34.967
two towns over just till
the new dog gets settled.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.969
Well, we wrecked
the first dog.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.013
We've got to treat
this one right.

Bart, why don't you take Laddie
for another walk?

10:41.599 --> 10:44.268
No. Bart had his turn.

around the house with Bart.

eh, Mr. Brockman?

11:14.674 --> 11:16.133
No, no.
Jessica's been fixed.

11:16.217 --> 11:19.637

attention.

and glossy fur coat
of a Yale man.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.227
Hello, little fella.

11:28.688 --> 11:32.483
Smithers, I believe this dog
was in Skull and Bones.

11:32.566 --> 11:34.318
Whoa, cool dog!

11:34.402 --> 11:36.654
Can he catch a Frisbee?

11:36.737 --> 11:38.406
(barking)

11:40.491 --> 11:43.452
(cheering)

11:43.536 --> 11:46.664
Boy, Bart Laddie's
the best dog in the world.

11:46.747 --> 11:48.624
He's nothing like
your old dog.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.543
Santa's Little Helper?

11:50.626 --> 11:52.670
Guess I was the only one
who loved him.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.255
You got that right.

11:54.338 --> 11:56.173
Remember the time
he ate my goldfish

11:56.257 --> 11:58.759
and you lied to me and said
I never had any goldfish?

11:58.843 --> 12:00.636
But why'd I have
the bowl, Bart?

12:00.720 --> 12:03.180
Why did I have the bowl?

12:03.264 --> 12:04.890
Yeah.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.392
He was a great dog.

12:11.188 --> 12:12.857
Oh, Santa's Little Helper,

12:12.940 --> 12:14.608
I was crazy to give you up
for another dog.

12:14.692 --> 12:16.527
What have I done to you?

12:18.404 --> 12:20.698
(horn blowing)

12:20.781 --> 12:23.075
Captain, can't we go
any faster?

12:23.159 --> 12:25.786
I greatly fear we shan't be
in Wimbledon by noonfall.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.705
No worries, madam.

12:27.788 --> 12:30.583
Lumley! Shovel on
more dogs, won't you?

12:30.666 --> 12:32.585
Aye, aye.
More dogs!

12:32.668 --> 12:34.712
-(bell ringing)
-More dogs!

12:37.214 --> 12:38.507
In you go.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.135
(gasps)

12:41.218 --> 12:43.512
Nah. That's not too likely.

12:43.596 --> 12:44.764
But still...

12:44.847 --> 12:46.640
you're gone.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.517
Oh.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.727
Where you are you, boy?

12:49.810 --> 12:51.645
(horn blowing)

12:55.816 --> 12:57.109
"Time for a walk."

12:57.193 --> 12:59.445
Ohh! Again?

12:59.528 --> 13:01.614
We got to find out
where he's keeping these.

13:01.697 --> 13:04.158
I'd take him, but those cards
are nontransferable.

13:04.241 --> 13:05.743
Ohh...

13:09.163 --> 13:10.664
CHILD: Help! Help!

13:12.333 --> 13:13.959
(barking)

13:15.294 --> 13:17.546
Now what?
Aw, come on.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.632
I want to go home.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.259
So, Laddie,

13:22.343 --> 13:24.512
thank you for
your heroic rescue.

13:24.595 --> 13:27.932
And, baby Gerald,
we can't help but wonder

13:28.015 --> 13:30.643
what mischief
you'll get into next.

13:30.726 --> 13:33.604
(applause)

13:33.687 --> 13:35.189
Now can we go home?

13:35.272 --> 13:36.857
Laddie saved the day, Simpson.

13:36.941 --> 13:40.027
Boy, we sure could use
a dog like that on the force.

13:41.529 --> 13:42.780
Why don't you guys
take him?

13:42.863 --> 13:44.782
I thought he was
the right dog for me

13:44.865 --> 13:46.784
but I guess
I made a mistake.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.786
Really? No fooling?

13:48.869 --> 13:50.621
Aw, gee,
thanks, mister.

13:50.704 --> 13:52.289
We'll take real
good care of him

13:52.373 --> 13:54.083
and we'll play
with him every day.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.543
Honest.
(grunting)

13:58.295 --> 14:01.215
Oh, Maggie,
you got oatmeal all over.

14:01.298 --> 14:02.633
Homie, would you
clean her off?

14:02.716 --> 14:04.134
Can do.

14:05.594 --> 14:06.637
Laddie!

14:06.720 --> 14:07.888
(whistling)

14:07.972 --> 14:09.431
Come here, boy!

14:09.515 --> 14:12.017
Who wants to lick a messy baby?

14:12.101 --> 14:14.103
-Laddie?
-Uh, Dad?

14:14.186 --> 14:15.855
Laddie's not coming.

14:15.938 --> 14:19.316
-I gave him away.
-What's the matter, Bart?

14:19.400 --> 14:21.110
Weren't you happy with him?

14:21.193 --> 14:23.404
No. He just wasn't
the right dog for me.

14:23.487 --> 14:25.030
I'm sure he'll be happy
as a police dog.

14:25.114 --> 14:27.533
He better know
how to keep his mouth shut.

14:27.616 --> 14:30.077
Well, if that's what
you think is best.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.745
Let's just go down
to the kennel

14:31.829 --> 14:33.747
and get Santa's
Little Helper back.

14:33.831 --> 14:36.792
Uh, well, we can't.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.961
He's not in a kennel.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.171
I gave him away, too,
and I don't know where he is.

14:41.255 --> 14:42.798
You gave both dogs away?

14:42.882 --> 14:45.593
You know how I feel
about giving!

14:45.676 --> 14:48.721
I'm sorry. I know it's wrong.
I messed everything up,

14:48.804 --> 14:50.806
and now I don't have
any dogs at all.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.808
There, there.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.101
Shut up, boy.

14:54.184 --> 14:55.686
We'll just get you a new dog.

14:55.769 --> 14:57.730
I don't want a new dog.

14:57.813 --> 14:59.356
I want Santa's Little Helper.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.984
Well, crying isn't going
to bring him back...

15:02.067 --> 15:04.778
unless your tears
smell like dog food.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.822
So you can either
sit there crying

15:06.906 --> 15:08.782
and eating can after can
of dog food

15:08.866 --> 15:11.243
until your tears
smell enough like dog food

15:11.327 --> 15:12.661
to make your dog come back

15:12.745 --> 15:15.956
or you can go out there
and find your dog.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.834
You're right.
I'll do it.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.878
Rats. I almost had him
eating dog food.

15:24.048 --> 15:26.175
I'm going to get the dog back.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.968
HOMER:
The bad dog or the good dog?

15:28.052 --> 15:29.511
-The bad dog.
-Oh, good.

15:35.392 --> 15:37.478
You got to give me back
my floor.

15:37.561 --> 15:40.481
My customers are walking around
on the pipes!

15:40.564 --> 15:41.732
Hey, next time,
pay your bills.

15:41.815 --> 15:43.776
But I don't want to.

15:43.859 --> 15:46.278
Excuse me, sir. Did you repossess
this dog from a guy

15:46.362 --> 15:49.031
named Santos L. Halper?

15:49.114 --> 15:51.742
Hmm. Yeah, yeah.
I remember this mutt.

15:51.825 --> 15:53.535
We, uh, sold him
to some guy

15:53.619 --> 15:54.995
wearing a dress.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.623
No, I didn't buy your dog.

15:57.706 --> 16:00.167
I got to go keep
an eye on Selma.

16:00.250 --> 16:02.294
She thinks
she swallowed a Band-Aid.

16:05.714 --> 16:07.925
(heavy brogue) Yeah, I bought
your mutt, and I ate him.

16:08.008 --> 16:10.052
(gasps)

16:10.135 --> 16:13.222
I ate his little face.
I ate his guts.

16:13.305 --> 16:15.808
And I 'ate the way
he's always barking!

16:15.891 --> 16:19.770
So I gave him to the church.

16:19.853 --> 16:23.732
Oh, I see. You hate him
so you gave him to the church.

16:23.816 --> 16:27.361
Aye. I also ate
the mess he left on me rug.

16:27.444 --> 16:28.696
You heard me.

16:30.864 --> 16:34.410
Mmm, yes, I remember
Satan's Little Helper...

16:34.493 --> 16:36.578
littering the rectory
with his dirt,

16:36.662 --> 16:38.205
biting me in the apse.

16:38.288 --> 16:40.124
He unholied the holy water.

16:40.207 --> 16:41.667
That's him, all right.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.585
I'll be happy to take him
off your hands.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.337
I'm afraid
that's impossible, Bart.

16:45.421 --> 16:46.714
He's no longer among us.

16:46.797 --> 16:49.383
(gasps)
You didn't crucify him?

16:49.466 --> 16:52.553
(hearty laugh)

16:52.636 --> 16:55.014
No. He's safely with
one of our parishioners.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.182
I'll give you his address,
if you like.

16:57.266 --> 17:00.144
And then,
buy something or get out!

17:00.227 --> 17:01.145
Angel.

17:06.608 --> 17:09.028
Hey, it's him.
It's Santa's Little Helper!

17:15.492 --> 17:17.745
-(buzzes)
-MAN: <i>Yes?</i>

17:17.828 --> 17:19.204
My name is Bart Simpson.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.373
I have to talk to you
about your dog.

17:21.457 --> 17:22.666
Give me one minute.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.668
Okay... showtime.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.462
(wicked laugh)

17:27.588 --> 17:29.089
Please, mister...

17:29.173 --> 17:31.216
(clears throat)
No. Let me do that again.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.760
Please, mister.

17:32.843 --> 17:34.678
(sobbing):
Ple-he-he-he-ase...

17:34.762 --> 17:36.764
(gasps)

17:36.847 --> 17:38.515
Hi, there.
How can I help you?

17:38.599 --> 17:39.975
You're the guy
who owns the dog?

17:40.059 --> 17:41.810
Yep. His name's Sprinkles.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.605
-Sprinkles?
-Yeah. He's my best buddy, huh?

17:44.688 --> 17:47.107
Especially since my parrot
decided to stop talking.

17:47.191 --> 17:50.694
Polly? Polly want to say hi
to our guest? Huh?

17:50.778 --> 17:53.322
Fine. Be that way.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.324
Now, what can I do
for you, son?

17:55.407 --> 17:57.326
Oh, nothing.
Forget it.

18:02.039 --> 18:03.665
So, that's my plan.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.667
I'm gonna break into
the blind man's yard

18:05.751 --> 18:07.544
and swipe the dog.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.713
Bart, that is a new low.

18:09.797 --> 18:12.382
Hey, I'm not saying it's going to be
a dance around the maypole.

18:12.466 --> 18:14.134
I won't tell Mom and Dad

18:14.218 --> 18:16.095
but only because
I want the dog back.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.597
Just try not to freak out
the blind man.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.724
I can't promise I'll try,

18:20.808 --> 18:22.476
but I'll try to try.

18:25.604 --> 18:26.939
(whistles softly)

18:27.022 --> 18:28.524
(whispers):
Here, boy. Come on.

18:28.607 --> 18:29.525
(muffled yelp)

18:29.608 --> 18:31.068
Oh...

18:37.616 --> 18:38.659
(water splashing)

18:38.742 --> 18:40.452
-(squishing)
-Ew!

18:42.287 --> 18:43.539
Psst!

18:45.749 --> 18:47.793
Oh! I missed you
so much, boy.

18:47.876 --> 18:48.877
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.379
Now, keep quiet, okay?

18:50.462 --> 18:52.673
(barks)

18:52.756 --> 18:53.799
MITCHELL:
Sprinkles?

18:53.882 --> 18:55.175
Is there somebody down there?

18:55.259 --> 18:56.426
Come on, boy.
Let's blow.

18:58.595 --> 19:00.722
Who's there?
I can take you on.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.307
You want to try me?
Come on!

19:05.144 --> 19:08.021
Where is he, Sprinkles?
Come on. Let's get him.

19:08.105 --> 19:11.900
No, no, no. Not the piano.
I can't play now.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.403
-(squeaks)
-(door slams)

19:14.486 --> 19:16.780
Ha! I may be blind,

19:16.864 --> 19:18.782
but you just ran
into a closet.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.409
-D-ohh!
-(lock clicks)

19:23.787 --> 19:24.746
Heh-heh!

19:24.830 --> 19:26.748
Hey, burglar!

19:26.832 --> 19:28.333
I hope you're having
a good time in there,

19:28.417 --> 19:30.669
'cause the police
will be here any minute.

19:30.752 --> 19:33.297
No, mister.
Please, I 'm just a kid.

19:33.380 --> 19:37.134
I... I only came
to get my dog back.

19:37.217 --> 19:38.468
Your dog?

19:38.552 --> 19:40.929
(whines)

19:41.013 --> 19:42.306
And I miss him so much.

19:42.389 --> 19:44.433
And I know you like him,
but I like him, too.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.310
And he was mine first.
I know I don't deserve him.

19:46.393 --> 19:48.103
So what this
comes down to is

19:48.187 --> 19:50.272
you want a blind man

19:50.355 --> 19:51.523
to give up
his only companion?

19:51.607 --> 19:52.858
Yes, please.

19:52.941 --> 19:55.485
Hmm. Tell you what:

19:55.569 --> 19:59.072
Why don't we let
the dog decide?

19:59.156 --> 20:00.490
-Come on, Sprinkles!
-Come on, Santa's Little Helper!

20:00.574 --> 20:02.034
-Here, Sprinkles!
-I'm sorry!

20:02.117 --> 20:05.120
I'm blind,
Come to the blind man!

20:05.204 --> 20:07.915
I'll let you be with me
all the time.

20:07.998 --> 20:09.583
I need you more, come on!

20:09.666 --> 20:13.378
(overlapping chatter)

20:13.462 --> 20:15.339
Come on!

20:15.422 --> 20:18.759
Attaboy!
Oh, I knew you'd come!

20:18.842 --> 20:20.093
Give me a kiss!

20:20.177 --> 20:22.804
Oh-oh-oh. Yeah.

20:22.888 --> 20:25.432
Sounds like you won.

20:25.515 --> 20:26.600
Congratulations.

20:26.683 --> 20:29.228
Oh, geez.
I'm sorry.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.396
I wish there was some way
we could both have a dog.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.148
(pounding)

20:34.566 --> 20:36.860
-(doorbell rings)
-Hello.

20:36.944 --> 20:38.695
Police.

20:38.779 --> 20:41.949
Ah, man, if this one's
not the right house, I quit.

20:42.032 --> 20:43.575
It's okay, Officer.
False alarm.

20:43.659 --> 20:44.910
(barking)

20:48.789 --> 20:50.874
Uh... hey, who's that!

20:50.958 --> 20:52.834
Well, I like you, too.

20:52.918 --> 20:56.338
Well, looks like somebody's
made a new best friend.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.590
(laughs)
Okay, boy.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.384
That's enough.
That's...

21:00.467 --> 21:01.843
That's not for doggies.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.345
Don't...

21:03.428 --> 21:04.554
Oh, jeez.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.598
(barks)

21:06.682 --> 21:08.767
(sniffs)
Marijuana.

21:08.850 --> 21:11.561
