Say goodbye.

01:13.378 --> 01:14.128
Bye-bye.

01:20.130 --> 01:21.730
Leave them here, I'll come back.

01:47.963 --> 01:49.813

Somebody help us!
Anyone!

Let me go!
Joe!

04:08.391 --> 04:11.923
Joe! Get off me!
Get off me!

06:28.727 --> 06:32.531
Feel the fear.
And let it pass.

06:37.552 --> 06:39.527
You hear footsteps behind you.

06:39.647 --> 06:41.397
<i> But you don't turn around. </i>

06:42.116 --> 06:43.066
You can't.

06:43.686 --> 06:45.686
<i> The steps are getting nearer now. </i>

06:45.959 --> 06:47.724
<i> they turn louder and louder. </i>

06:48.373 --> 06:50.373
The panic is trying to get in.

06:50.575 --> 06:52.375
<i> it's harder to breathe. </i>

06:53.414 --> 06:55.451
<i> Now, you see a light
ahead of you. </i>

06:55.923 --> 06:57.073
<i> A car. </i>

06:57.638 --> 07:00.055
<i> There's a friendly person
in this car. </i>

07:00.175 --> 07:01.575
<i> You can make it. </i>

07:02.690 --> 07:05.080
<i> Suddenly, the steps behind you,
become a run. </i>

07:05.200 --> 07:06.844
They're trying to get you.

07:06.964 --> 07:08.614
<i> Walk faster, Tommy </i>

07:08.857 --> 07:10.607
<i> Get to that light </i>

07:13.440 --> 07:14.340
Freeze!

07:18.363 --> 07:20.463
Anyone knows anything?

07:20.907 --> 07:22.084
The stance?

07:22.204 --> 07:23.804
Stance. Ok.

07:24.286 --> 07:25.486
<i> Anyone else? </i>

07:27.967 --> 07:29.217
<i> Okay, Tommy. </i>

07:30.502 --> 07:32.952
I want you to slowly open your eyes

07:33.884 --> 07:35.984
<i> and take a look at yourself. </i>

07:46.126 --> 07:48.676
Everything about you, says victim.

07:50.148 --> 07:52.194
<i> The way you hold yourself. </i>

07:52.314 --> 07:55.201
Your arms and fists, held tight.

07:57.525 --> 07:58.875
Your back ...

07:59.076 --> 07:59.976
..bent over.

08:01.544 --> 08:03.994
Even your short irregular steps ...

08:05.671 --> 08:08.100
Why is it the people who have been
attacked in the past..

08:08.220 --> 08:11.620
..are more likely to get intact again in the future?

08:15.296 --> 08:16.846
Body language.

08:17.479 --> 08:20.929
Even the slightest thing,
you or I would take for granted.

08:21.803 --> 08:24.453
A potential predator can sense.

08:26.336 --> 08:29.286
<i> It's almost as if they can
see your fear. </i>

08:34.621 --> 08:36.171
How long you should've been comin' to us?

08:38.826 --> 08:40.076
Nine months, now.

08:42.025 --> 08:43.875
And this is happening tomorrow?

08:45.286 --> 08:45.986
Yeah.

08:48.787 --> 08:50.787
How does that make you feel?

08:54.338 --> 08:55.338
Lived.

08:58.187 --> 09:00.437
Because you can live here now?

09:01.943 --> 09:04.143
Because I can leave you now.

09:07.134 --> 09:08.134
Remember ...

09:09.119 --> 09:12.691
Controlling agoraphobia takes faith in yourself, Tommy.

09:13.034 --> 09:14.884
So, feel the fear,

09:15.464 --> 09:16.864
... and let it pass.

09:51.720 --> 09:54.070
<i> Right,..end of the road </i>

10:00.452 --> 10:03.810
<i> Last stop, son.
We don't go up further anymore.</i>

10:04.757 --> 10:07.676
Well what..what time the last bus into town, then?

10:07.796 --> 10:09.846
<i> Only one a day now. </i>

10:10.499 --> 10:11.994
<i> 6 o'clock. </i>

10:16.984 --> 10:18.367
Is that from here?

11:01.267 --> 11:05.270

15:12.395 --> 15:14.145
I'm so sorry, Tommy.

15:17.791 --> 15:20.541
Thanks for what
you did for Joanne.

15:23.867 --> 15:25.267
I really should..

15:25.510 --> 15:26.260
I know.

15:27.341 --> 15:28.141
I know.

15:29.377 --> 15:30.277
Come on.

15:36.219 --> 15:38.469
So how long have you been out of the hospital, now?

15:39.070 --> 15:40.424
..8 days.

15:41.561 --> 15:43.463
Wow..that support must be great..

15:48.315 --> 15:49.393
Tommy?

15:50.114 --> 15:51.064
What is it?

15:52.552 --> 15:54.992
Just the way that child looked at me.

15:55.112 --> 15:55.812
Well..

15:56.615 --> 15:57.765
The blind kid?

16:01.122 --> 16:02.097
<i> Marie </i>

16:02.974 --> 16:04.724
You should try to get some rest.

16:06.247 --> 16:07.343
Bye-bye.

16:45.606 --> 16:49.702
<i> Yea , though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death, </i>

16:51.561 --> 16:53.851
<i> I will fear no evil, </i>

17:06.179 --> 17:06.929
Amen.

17:09.377 --> 17:10.627
Are you leaving right away?

17:11.651 --> 17:13.743
I have to send Elsa to the council first.

17:15.042 --> 17:17.994
There's a coach leaving the city center at 8.

17:18.115 --> 17:21.377
Well, maybe once the regenerations happens,
maybe you could come back.

17:21.938 --> 17:23.785
If it ever happens.

17:23.905 --> 17:26.497
this is no place
to raise a child.

17:26.617 --> 17:27.517
Tommy ...

17:29.422 --> 17:33.372
You know moving away won't gonna stop
Social Services chasing her.

17:33.687 --> 17:36.637
You just have to prove to them that
you're a good dad.

17:37.429 --> 17:39.729
I'm not gonna let 'em take her away from me.

17:40.063 --> 17:40.863
I know.

17:44.551 --> 17:45.601
Bye,Elsa.

17:50.944 --> 17:52.594
Look after yourself, Tommy.

17:58.119 --> 18:00.543
Why don't you fuck off home?

18:00.663 --> 18:02.363
You shouldn't be out here.

18:03.777 --> 18:04.803
I'm sorry?

18:10.943 --> 18:13.588
They're gonna come looking for her.
You know that?

18:13.985 --> 18:15.035
Who will?

18:16.457 --> 18:17.507
Who will?

18:18.441 --> 18:20.041
You fuckin' know who!

18:31.597 --> 18:34.128
Get your fucking hands off me!

18:36.115 --> 18:38.821
- Why do we have to leave?
- That's his fucking husband!

18:41.228 --> 18:43.723
Now, Tommy Cowley ...

18:44.878 --> 18:47.158
You're one the last one of this stage.

18:47.278 --> 18:49.829
only took recent geriatrics left in here,now.

18:50.845 --> 18:52.909
What the fuck are you looking at?

18:54.741 --> 18:57.153
I'm trying to catch a bus ...

18:57.688 --> 19:00.088
..people will be dying to get out..

19:02.578 --> 19:06.778
At least the bloody lights work properly,
when the new power comes online.

19:16.167 --> 19:17.067
Hey..wait!

19:17.757 --> 19:19.725

24:53.568 --> 24:55.318

24:58.754 --> 25:00.604
There was break-in ...

25:01.913 --> 25:03.163
And then ...

25:21.731 --> 25:23.131
Feel the fear ...

25:24.205 --> 25:26.749
Feel the fear
and let it pass.

Come on!

28:29.454 --> 28:30.254
<i> Tommy </i>

28:44.733 --> 28:46.080
Tommy ...

28:47.831 --> 28:49.131
What happened?

28:57.427 --> 28:59.477
They came in the house last night.

29:00.405 --> 29:01.205
I know.

29:03.743 --> 29:05.993
Are you trying
to call the police?

29:07.106 --> 29:08.236
The cops won't come in.

29:10.715 --> 29:13.565
They do at least
to take a good look at these kids?

29:15.022 --> 29:16.572
It's definitely them.

29:18.180 --> 29:18.880
Who?

29:20.922 --> 29:23.172
The one who got Joanne.

29:23.937 --> 29:25.987
They came here
to kill Elsa.

29:28.737 --> 29:30.787
Lookin' to kill Elsa?

29:37.972 --> 29:38.772
Tommy?

29:40.390 --> 29:41.340
Look at me.

29:47.239 --> 29:51.389
What happened to Joanne
that was a tragic isolated incident.

29:52.869 --> 29:55.369
The wrong place,
at the wrong time.

29:56.070 --> 29:58.020
This isn't the same.

29:58.651 --> 30:02.401
I mean ... why would kids were
lookin' to kill a baby?

30:02.527 --> 30:03.527
I don't know.

30:04.327 --> 30:07.327
But he did ...
He said they come lookin' for her.

30:07.918 --> 30:08.968
Who did?

30:09.241 --> 30:10.191
The priest.

30:12.176 --> 30:13.076
Tommy ...

30:13.547 --> 30:17.298
I know he's all we've got,
but that man is messed up in the head.

30:17.651 --> 30:19.942
He helps out at the hospice,
you know what the nurses call him?

30:20.062 --> 30:22.262
I don't care
what they say.

30:22.576 --> 30:25.970
- He knew they'll come looking for her.
- Yeah, but they didn't come looking for Elsa.

30:26.090 --> 30:28.871
The cart upstairs was overturned,
the whole room was ransacked.

30:28.991 --> 30:30.941
So was down here, Tommy.

30:31.078 --> 30:34.579
Look, I know this is no less frightening,
but you were burglared.

30:34.699 --> 30:36.301
No. .. No, they would ...

30:36.421 --> 30:39.238
Tommy, these kids have nothing
to do, nowhere to go..

30:39.358 --> 30:40.592
They can quiet, easy, been looking for money ...

30:40.712 --> 30:43.569
You think I'm so messed up
I'm just imagining all this?

30:43.689 --> 30:46.089
Tommy, I'm just
trying to help.

30:48.090 --> 30:49.440
I know what I saw.

31:04.279 --> 31:05.179
Tommy ...

31:05.794 --> 31:08.394
<i>- I didn't mean ...
 - I need to see that priest. </i>

31:09.274 --> 31:10.574
what would about the bus?

31:12.216 --> 31:13.816
I need to see him.

31:20.079 --> 31:22.555
Ok..let's go together.

31:26.061 --> 31:28.711
I can't leave the house, Marie.

31:33.435 --> 31:34.835

32:19.967 --> 32:21.803

- Fuck's sake!

33:40.130 --> 33:41.636
Jesus Christ!

33:42.268 --> 33:44.076
Who gave you permission to come in here, huh?

33:44.196 --> 33:46.201
At the time you said they would
come looking for my daughter.

33:46.321 --> 33:48.280
- Get out!
- They came last night.

33:48.400 --> 33:49.868
Well they didn't get out, did they?

33:49.988 --> 33:52.950
If you don't mind, fuck it off!
I'm very busy.

33:57.245 --> 33:59.695
Please, I need to know
what you know.

34:09.440 --> 34:11.139
You see their faces?

This is insane.

34:31.295 --> 34:32.196
Alone.

34:41.775 --> 34:43.625
To be safe out at the hospice.

34:48.005 --> 34:49.655
I don't have all day! 

35:06.017 --> 35:06.967
He's blind.

35:09.428 --> 35:10.178
Right.

35:10.998 --> 35:12.098
What's his name?

35:13.414 --> 35:14.614
Ask him.

35:17.144 --> 35:19.310
Hey pal ... what's your name?

35:23.323 --> 35:25.323
You gonna tell him your name?

35:26.698 --> 35:27.998
His name is Danny.

35:29.408 --> 35:32.208
He's shy with new people.
You, son?

35:35.029 --> 35:37.129
Wait ...
Where are we going?

35:38.840 --> 35:41.096
No, no, no, no.
You can't!

35:41.941 --> 35:43.944
Please ...

35:44.810 --> 35:46.660
For God's sake, stop the car!

35:47.778 --> 35:50.428
Just stop the fucking
car, please!

35:55.065 --> 35:57.465
This is where the scums are coming from.

35:57.632 --> 35:59.132
North east tower block.

35:59.584 --> 36:01.734
I need to go back now.

36:05.998 --> 36:06.848
Get out.

36:08.377 --> 36:09.127
What?

36:09.586 --> 36:11.786
- Get out!
- No fucking way of me to get out.

36:20.686 --> 36:21.436
Get out!

36:22.082 --> 36:25.332
Act like a man!
It's a building, for Christ sake!

36:26.023 --> 36:26.973
Look at it!

36:31.800 --> 36:32.650
I see ...

36:38.531 --> 36:40.981
You wanna know why they're after you?

36:41.575 --> 36:43.125
Because you fear them.

36:44.588 --> 36:45.488
You fear them.

36:46.668 --> 36:47.568
They see it.

36:49.140 --> 36:52.586
They can see fear.
Sense it. Smell it.

36:53.665 --> 36:56.408
Otherwise, they mostly blind
of anything else.

36:56.528 --> 36:59.312
- What are you talking about?
- Fear!

36:59.704 --> 37:01.934
that's what they born into attracts them.

37:02.054 --> 37:06.332
To the victims, they thrive on it
and they draw you and your fear..

37:07.701 --> 37:11.093
..they're attracted to,
and consequently Elsa.

37:13.165 --> 37:16.487
Shit! Jesus Christ!
Some of them're watching us.

37:20.557 --> 37:22.151
Oh they see you, Tommy.

37:23.500 --> 37:25.748
They see you very
fucking clearly.

37:26.068 --> 37:29.718
- Please, quick, the door!
- There's more others than before.

37:30.470 --> 37:32.620
This could end before
it's too late.

37:32.788 --> 37:35.084
Before they fuck spread somewhere else.

37:35.204 --> 37:37.955
- Please, quick, the door!
- You're going to help me, Tommy.

37:38.075 --> 37:40.053
- Open the door!
- Will you help me?

37:40.173 --> 37:41.673
How can I help you?

37:45.209 --> 37:47.697
If we open the gas flank on the floors,

37:47.817 --> 37:51.332
blow them in riser,
we can torch that fucking place.

37:51.452 --> 37:53.452
So the kids there..
the kids ...

37:53.805 --> 37:56.205
Kids?
I don't see any kids!

37:56.416 --> 37:58.356
Do they look like kids to you?

38:00.162 --> 38:01.486
Get a hold to yourself!

38:04.814 --> 38:06.723
<i>- Jesus!
 - Useless fuck up! </i>

38:30.572 --> 38:31.772
Go on, get out.

38:32.758 --> 38:36.356
- You want to torch the building?
- Condemned.

38:37.825 --> 38:40.099
- Infected.
- I used to live there.

38:41.308 --> 38:44.958
We wait for the last vestige
of humanity to leave.

38:45.146 --> 38:46.596
Now it's the time.

38:51.262 --> 38:53.262
Let me ask you something.

38:54.763 --> 38:56.163
What would you have done,

38:56.283 --> 38:59.733
if the lift door had opened that day?

39:02.019 --> 39:03.419
What would you have done,

39:03.970 --> 39:05.770
to protect your wife?

39:09.112 --> 39:10.924
You gotta fucking kill them!

39:15.826 --> 39:18.076
Let's candle these fuck ass!

39:19.535 --> 39:20.335
Tommy?

39:22.707 --> 39:24.757
You know what?
She's right about you.

39:25.234 --> 39:26.384
You are insane.

39:27.253 --> 39:29.553
I suggest you take a look at the mirror, pal.

39:31.061 --> 39:32.517
I have a condition.

39:33.334 --> 39:35.256
You certainly fuckin do.

39:52.121 --> 39:53.471
<i> Help yourself </i>

39:57.318 --> 39:58.568
Hey, Marie ...

40:00.288 --> 40:02.488
Thanks for letting me stay.

40:11.769 --> 40:13.718
Marie, you were right.

40:15.179 --> 40:17.529
You were right
about the priest.

40:18.706 --> 40:20.583
He must think I'm an idiot.

40:20.703 --> 40:24.753
I just got upset the thought someone
took advantage of you. That's all.

40:25.846 --> 40:28.439
And yeah,... you are an idiot.

40:29.937 --> 40:34.237
To be honest, I thought you'd
run away, leaving me with the baby.

40:36.018 --> 40:37.718
So, what 'happened?

40:38.311 --> 40:40.229
Did he know who these kids were?

40:40.349 --> 40:43.187
Actually Ted convince me that
they're not even human.

40:43.307 --> 40:45.442
What?
That's outrageous!

40:45.562 --> 40:46.662
Honestly,

40:46.984 --> 40:50.038
and so easy to demonize these kids
"they're not even human".

40:50.158 --> 40:52.311
If people have that man,
have their way,

40:52.431 --> 40:55.981
they would lock 'em up in the building
and burn it to the ground.

40:58.336 --> 41:00.268
I worked with a lot of socially deprived kids,

41:00.388 --> 41:02.528
and most of them is just unloved

41:02.648 --> 41:05.998
one of waste from broken homes.
What they need is all symphaty.

41:12.120 --> 41:13.470
Legs first.

41:18.647 --> 41:20.147
Let me help you.

41:25.396 --> 41:26.446
Wait..

41:27.633 --> 41:28.383
That's good.

41:31.785 --> 41:32.535
Okay.

41:33.363 --> 41:35.655
Here, first the legs ...

41:38.738 --> 41:39.988
Here we are.

41:42.567 --> 41:44.985
- I can't do this.
- You can't do what?

41:47.187 --> 41:49.837
She cries everytime I pick her up.

41:50.663 --> 41:52.963
Well, baby can sense fear.

41:57.706 --> 41:58.606
Tommy ...

42:02.867 --> 42:04.967
Do you ever try talking to Elsa?

42:05.936 --> 42:08.236
She's a whole special person all by herself.

42:09.542 --> 42:12.342
Not just the result of what happened to Joanne.

42:18.835 --> 42:20.929
- Suede ...
- What is?

42:24.563 --> 42:27.263
Joanne used to make me dance
to this song.

42:29.206 --> 42:30.756
I don't like dancing,

42:32.061 --> 42:34.111
It made her smile.

42:36.139 --> 42:37.939
You made her smile.

42:49.704 --> 42:50.554
Stand up!

42:53.246 --> 42:55.480
Marie ... I don't know...

42:55.820 --> 42:56.670
Stand up!

43:13.709 --> 43:15.609
Try closing your eyes.

43:56.156 --> 43:57.206
It's ok..

43:58.713 --> 43:59.763
It's ok..

45:05.214 --> 45:09.114
<i> "Tommy, help yourself to the kitchen.
Will be back in time to help you to the bus. "</i>

45:25.846 --> 45:26.596
Elsa.

45:33.259 --> 45:34.259
Are you okay?

45:47.066 --> 45:49.016
You know, you're looking a lot better.

45:49.860 --> 45:51.518
I still feel lost, though..

45:51.638 --> 45:53.178
How can you feel lost?

45:53.298 --> 45:55.203
Didn't you deliver the post around
here?

45:55.323 --> 45:57.299
I worked in a post office.

45:57.419 --> 46:00.969
Besides, it's all the same to me, every city street.

46:01.283 --> 46:02.033
What?

46:02.422 --> 46:06.049
Well, I'm afraid to tell you that
I actually requested more time here.

46:07.631 --> 46:09.381
You're crazier than the priest.

46:10.743 --> 46:12.497
Yes she , she question me.

46:13.850 --> 46:16.000
- Is the bus almost there?
- They're there.

46:18.920 --> 46:20.208
No way.

46:20.328 --> 46:21.859
I'm not going down that fucking line.

46:21.979 --> 46:25.079
The bus stop is just three vent,
like 30 seconds.

46:25.920 --> 46:28.770
<i> Look, we'll have to go all the way around,
we'll miss the bus. </i>

46:32.489 --> 46:35.889
I go this way to work every single day.

46:36.224 --> 46:37.569
It's fine.

46:38.101 --> 46:38.901
Come on ...

46:56.512 --> 46:57.362
Here we are.

47:01.646 --> 47:03.251
- Shit!
- Tommy.

47:03.371 --> 47:05.102
For fuck sake!

47:06.452 --> 47:09.764
- We should go back the other way.
- You can practically see the bus!

47:09.884 --> 47:12.784
- It's too fuck dangerous!
- That's not fair.

47:14.672 --> 47:18.934
Okay, look, I'm gonna show you
there's nothing to be afraid of, ok?

47:21.295 --> 47:22.195
Marie ...

47:23.244 --> 47:24.644
Marie, please..

48:13.658 --> 48:14.704
Fuck! 

48:15.794 --> 48:16.594
Fuck!

48:56.366 --> 48:58.874
Must ... I must ...
must help me!

48:59.376 --> 49:01.986
Some kids ...
Help me!

49:02.335 --> 49:05.583
Please help me.
Please, no, no!

50:12.953 --> 50:14.103
<i> Jesus' Christ </i>

50:16.241 --> 50:18.291
<i> For the love of God,
what ... </i>

50:59.906 --> 51:02.208
No!
No, no! No!

51:02.994 --> 51:05.078
Elsa! No!
Elsa!

52:12.863 --> 52:13.563
Hello?

52:16.851 --> 52:18.051
Someone there?

53:09.997 --> 53:12.148
Father!
Father!

53:12.268 --> 53:14.282
They've got her!
They've got her!

53:14.283 --> 53:16.283
They've got her!
They've got her!

53:17.411 --> 53:19.740
- I know ... I know.
- They killed Elsa.

53:19.860 --> 53:21.853
Tommy, she's not dead.

53:22.755 --> 53:26.005
That's what the bastards do.
They take children.

53:26.301 --> 53:29.262
What? Jesus!
We should go ...

53:29.382 --> 53:32.526
- Don't go anywhere
- We need to get to the towers!

53:32.646 --> 53:34.534
We need to get there tonight
please!

53:34.654 --> 53:36.832
- Tommy, would you listen to me ...
- No, I need to get there..

53:36.952 --> 53:40.052
- I need to get there tonight!
- We can't!

54:04.631 --> 54:06.400
Get off me!
Get off me!

54:09.143 --> 54:10.593
What do you think you're doing?

54:11.472 --> 54:14.384
- I'll go on my own.
- We can't go tonight!

54:14.504 --> 54:15.776
There's a blackout!

54:15.896 --> 54:18.465
They'll scum you out of the tower on the prowl.

54:18.585 --> 54:21.735
- We'll go tomorrow night.
- I don't care, I'm going tonight!

54:30.617 --> 54:31.898
I know where she is.

54:33.841 --> 54:34.941
If I help you,

54:37.014 --> 54:39.514
Will you help me
start the fire?

54:41.308 --> 54:44.508
I need you to follow my lead to trust me.

54:45.732 --> 54:47.882
No one knew we will get through this.

54:48.767 --> 54:50.417
Sermon hiddden .

54:51.669 --> 54:54.769
- How do we do that?
- They can see fear.

54:55.254 --> 54:57.073
Don't let they do it.

54:57.193 --> 55:00.705
Partly, sense all,
they smell it other...

55:01.577 --> 55:05.114
the secrete, hormone,
cortisol ...

55:05.836 --> 55:06.886
But Danny ...

55:08.751 --> 55:09.751
Danny doesn't.

55:10.474 --> 55:11.674
They don't see him.

55:12.480 --> 55:14.030
You stay close to Danny,

55:15.324 --> 55:16.724
No one see you.

55:18.556 --> 55:19.656
I don't understand.

55:25.328 --> 55:26.728
Don't be afraid, Tommy.

55:27.439 --> 55:28.589
Have faith.

55:31.362 --> 55:33.231
How come he has the hands?

55:33.351 --> 55:36.620
I found him in the tower.
It was becoming one of them.

55:40.762 --> 55:43.362
Danny could've been with them
for a very long.

55:43.609 --> 55:44.909
He's still healthy.

55:45.602 --> 55:47.802
He understood,
when I spoke to him.

55:48.363 --> 55:52.051
The others ... Tower
done something to them.

55:53.170 --> 55:54.520
Poisoned them.

55:54.975 --> 55:58.325
I never know who they was,
where they came from.

55:59.067 --> 56:00.717
He doesn't remember none of it.

56:01.738 --> 56:03.638
Will Elsa become one?

56:04.649 --> 56:06.099
No, if we find her.

56:11.120 --> 56:13.270
Home made plastic explosives.

56:13.538 --> 56:15.188
I saw their faces.

56:16.639 --> 56:17.639
What are they?

56:23.385 --> 56:24.235
Demons.

56:26.652 --> 56:27.502
Demons?

56:31.895 --> 56:33.295
Fuck sake.

56:33.572 --> 56:36.122
Your believe'd just a bit error
right now, wouldn't you?

56:41.723 --> 56:43.223
<i> There was a girl ... </i>

56:44.032 --> 56:46.866
<i> junkie.
Dolores.</i>

56:47.762 --> 56:50.307
<i> She was a beautiful girl.
Tragic.</i>

56:51.696 --> 56:55.556
So.. in '72, she was found
dead at the bell of that Tower.

56:55.676 --> 56:59.190
She died of unidentified infection.

56:59.655 --> 57:03.746
But what people didn't know
was that before Dolores died,

57:04.811 --> 57:06.285
she gave birth on the..

57:07.394 --> 57:08.494
Twins.

57:09.936 --> 57:13.422
Junkies squatter used to talk
of dumb children.

57:14.158 --> 57:15.728
Brother and sister.

57:15.848 --> 57:16.898
Abe and Matt.

57:21.531 --> 57:26.421
They are into bred, raise the spawn,
they will make the new heir.

57:31.646 --> 57:33.196
So, they are children?

57:33.974 --> 57:36.474
Don't think of them as humans..

57:36.868 --> 57:38.365
..or it can be saved.

57:39.250 --> 57:40.450
I tried.

57:41.612 --> 57:43.212
I got this.

57:46.412 --> 57:47.562
Like cancer.

57:48.373 --> 57:51.773
Cutting the hands must the best small thing you can do.

58:42.779 --> 58:44.688
Fuck! Fuck!

58:47.645 --> 58:48.690
Danny?

58:48.810 --> 58:52.669
Can not see you, Tommy.
Can not see you.

58:54.860 --> 58:56.460
They can't see you.

58:57.491 --> 58:59.304
They can't see you.

59:13.489 --> 59:14.689
How did you do that?

59:15.604 --> 59:16.804
I told you.

59:17.838 --> 59:20.188
He can hide your fear from them.

59:21.054 --> 59:23.254
Can you see fear like they do?

59:24.835 --> 59:26.135
What does fear look like?

59:27.518 --> 59:28.691
A red is.

59:30.453 --> 59:31.785
How do I look?

59:34.750 --> 59:35.750
Scarlet.

59:54.634 --> 59:55.484
Yeah.

59:57.451 --> 01:00:00.831
There's a fuse.
Set the charge the plastic.

01:00:01.312 --> 01:00:03.625
Pass the cable.

01:00:05.032 --> 01:00:07.811
We tie this to the ignition plug.

01:00:12.036 --> 01:00:13.236
Would you look?

01:00:13.912 --> 01:00:15.762
One of us has gonna have to do this.

01:00:16.562 --> 01:00:20.573
Come dawn, I'll hold to the fell fuck I'm gonna
come back to the Tower.

01:00:21.259 --> 01:00:23.702
- Once you're inside ...
- Turn the key and ...

01:00:23.822 --> 01:00:25.872
- ..start the engine.
- Yeah.

01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:28.437
Right ... let's go.
Follow me.

01:00:28.979 --> 01:00:30.529
Hold on to Danny.

01:00:31.395 --> 01:00:33.688
If you let go, we're fucked.

01:00:34.644 --> 01:00:36.194
We're at you, Tommy.

01:00:40.401 --> 01:00:41.901
Do you still believe in all that?

01:00:43.862 --> 01:00:44.762
You don't?

01:00:46.131 --> 01:00:47.946
Punishment come right out to this world.

01:00:48.273 --> 01:00:49.573
As a salvation.

01:00:49.871 --> 01:00:52.205
We got ourselves to believe in, Tommy.

01:00:52.325 --> 01:00:55.025
That how we got our fuckin' hope.

01:01:27.257 --> 01:01:29.391
This may gas pipe of the building.

01:01:29.511 --> 01:01:32.661
When we turn the key
the gas are gonna blow 3 floors.

01:01:33.064 --> 01:01:36.214
- How did you learn to do this?
- Past life ...

01:01:37.862 --> 01:01:39.112
Do you know it will work?

01:01:39.232 --> 01:01:41.782
Let's just say
in the past I have done it.

01:01:44.712 --> 01:01:45.462
Right.

01:01:46.862 --> 01:01:48.512
Now, we open the gas.

01:01:56.974 --> 01:01:57.774
Here..

01:01:58.515 --> 01:01:59.865
Try this.

01:02:44.901 --> 01:02:46.351
This is the first one.

01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:48.778
Break it there.
Be careful.

01:02:54.201 --> 01:02:56.577
- Right.
- Open the valve.

01:03:01.561 --> 01:03:02.911
Now, we climb.

01:03:16.131 --> 01:03:18.795
The stairs continue on
the other side.

01:03:19.925 --> 01:03:20.825
Come on.

01:03:49.124 --> 01:03:50.776
They can't see us.

01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:53.590
What are they doing?

01:03:55.145 --> 01:03:57.110
I don't know what their shit is ...

01:03:57.230 --> 01:03:59.230
All towers are infected with it.

01:04:00.025 --> 01:04:02.125
We gotta keep moving.

01:04:02.826 --> 01:04:05.176
You'll be safe with Danny.
Believe me.

01:04:05.478 --> 01:04:07.678
Just stay quiet,
follow me.

01:04:11.017 --> 01:04:12.717
Close your eyes, Tommy.

01:04:16.754 --> 01:04:18.204
Trust yourself.

01:04:53.977 --> 01:04:55.977
You can open your eyes now.

01:04:57.428 --> 01:04:59.432
<i> Quickly, this way. </i>

01:05:07.685 --> 01:05:09.995
- Just one more, right?
- Yeah.

01:05:10.698 --> 01:05:11.882
Then we're after ...

01:05:14.912 --> 01:05:17.962
- Sound like a baby.
- Stay focus, Tommy.

01:05:18.539 --> 01:05:21.180
- We knew where they are ...
- It's her.

01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:23.050
- It's Elsa!
- Tommy!

01:05:23.970 --> 01:05:24.970
Get back here!

01:05:25.955 --> 01:05:27.955
- Tommy!
- Danny, please!

01:05:28.091 --> 01:05:29.591
The Father says no!

01:05:43.032 --> 01:05:44.455
I'm here, Elsa!

01:06:50.377 --> 01:06:51.227
Idiot!

01:06:51.694 --> 01:06:53.344
If you try something like that..

01:06:53.587 --> 01:06:56.137
- I want your fuckin baby drown..
- Fuck you!

01:06:57.140 --> 01:06:59.787
- Why can't you tell me where she is?
- What do you think?

01:06:59.907 --> 01:07:03.261
Only a screaming baby is
gonna fake the job with you

01:07:05.059 --> 01:07:07.946
We do this fast, right?

01:07:20.222 --> 01:07:23.488
If you don't like it dad,
hold my hand.

01:07:35.474 --> 01:07:37.775
Tommy ...

01:07:41.411 --> 01:07:44.009
<i>- We need to go up..
 - It's  dawn. </i>

01:07:44.641 --> 01:07:46.527
<i> We went too high, dumbo. </i>

01:07:48.058 --> 01:07:50.048
We just need to break this ...

01:07:57.139 --> 01:08:00.002
- Are you alright?
- Christ, not now!

01:08:02.953 --> 01:08:04.054
Not here, damn it!

01:08:04.884 --> 01:08:05.684
Father!

01:08:06.462 --> 01:08:07.762
I'm alright, Danny.

01:08:08.736 --> 01:08:09.936
I see you.

01:08:11.804 --> 01:08:13.554
- What?
- I see you.

01:08:15.398 --> 01:08:16.948
So did they ...

01:08:20.957 --> 01:08:22.756
I can barely breathe.

01:08:23.026 --> 01:08:24.876
for feeling's on time.

01:08:28.529 --> 01:08:29.828
Listen to me.

01:08:30.983 --> 01:08:32.533
Fuck the burnt..

01:08:32.747 --> 01:08:35.564
Go find your daughter
and leave.

01:08:35.866 --> 01:08:37.366
She's in the basement.

01:08:39.894 --> 01:08:41.944
Leave this in our place.

01:08:42.638 --> 01:08:45.288
- Father, where are you going?
- Danny!

01:08:45.758 --> 01:08:48.149
You stay close to Tommy,
right?

01:08:53.837 --> 01:08:54.636
You know ...

01:08:56.365 --> 01:08:57.215
They ...

01:08:59.432 --> 01:09:00.482
They were mine.

01:09:02.321 --> 01:09:03.671
What are you talking about?

01:09:05.810 --> 01:09:06.810
The twins.

01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:10.871
I've abandoned.

01:09:13.819 --> 01:09:18.313
I've abandoned ...
this whole fucking place.

01:09:18.763 --> 01:09:19.960
Jesus ...

01:09:22.562 --> 01:09:24.412
I won't find forgiveness, Tommy.

01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:27.907
But, I can let the ...

01:09:28.027 --> 01:09:29.795
drift die with me.

01:09:34.053 --> 01:09:35.803
Go find your daughter.

01:09:36.666 --> 01:09:37.765
No, wait.

01:09:37.886 --> 01:09:41.005
- Danny can hide us. He can hide the both of us.
- Danny ...

01:09:41.698 --> 01:09:43.548
can't hide anyone!

01:09:44.947 --> 01:09:47.602
<i> Go! Run!</i>

01:10:04.409 --> 01:10:06.173
Come on, you bastards!

01:10:21.102 --> 01:10:21.902
Shit!

01:10:23.405 --> 01:10:24.855
Where's the stairs?

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:29.680
The noise ...

01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:50.030
It's a lift.
The power's back.

01:10:56.348 --> 01:10:57.148
Tommy?

01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:01.840
What is it?

01:11:22.351 --> 01:11:25.310
Tommy! Tommy?
Tommy, what's' wrong?

01:11:48.884 --> 01:11:50.184
Tommy!

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:46.828
Danny?

01:12:50.954 --> 01:12:51.754
Danny?

01:13:03.726 --> 01:13:05.337
I'm Tommy.
It's ok.

01:13:05.457 --> 01:13:06.878
It's ok.

01:13:06.998 --> 01:13:09.638
- It's ok.
- We lied to you.

01:13:09.758 --> 01:13:12.383
- I can't ...
- I know, it's ok.

01:13:15.843 --> 01:13:17.793
I'm so scared, Tommy!

01:13:19.704 --> 01:13:21.597
It's ok to be scared.

01:13:22.653 --> 01:13:24.153
You're not alone, pal.

01:13:24.354 --> 01:13:25.754
Father's order.

01:13:28.606 --> 01:13:29.306
Yeah.

01:13:31.989 --> 01:13:33.489
But we're gonna make it.

01:13:35.212 --> 01:13:35.962
What?

01:13:39.501 --> 01:13:40.651
You don't believe me?

01:13:43.301 --> 01:13:43.951
No.

01:13:44.936 --> 01:13:47.534
How else do we get pass them before?

01:13:48.178 --> 01:13:49.928
I don't want to die here.

01:13:51.187 --> 01:13:53.437
I'm not gonna let you die, Danny.

01:13:55.157 --> 01:13:59.181
I don't care if we scared.
We're gonna make it through this.

01:14:03.603 --> 01:14:04.849
I'm here now.

01:14:05.606 --> 01:14:07.156
And I'm not gonna let you go again.

01:14:08.858 --> 01:14:09.958
I promise.

01:14:13.314 --> 01:14:14.214
Come on.

01:14:14.696 --> 01:14:15.872
Come here.

01:14:33.866 --> 01:14:35.422
It's bright out here.

01:14:40.404 --> 01:14:41.754
It 's almost dawn.

01:14:43.930 --> 01:14:45.330
They'll be back soon.

01:15:12.815 --> 01:15:14.365
I know the smell.

01:15:52.846 --> 01:15:54.346
What is this place?

01:16:11.033 --> 01:16:13.485
Elsa! Elsa!

01:16:20.772 --> 01:16:23.931
It was you! It was you.

01:16:26.091 --> 01:16:28.738
I was here!
I was here!

01:16:28.739 --> 01:16:31.331
I was here! I was here!

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:34.329
I was here!
I was here!

01:16:34.330 --> 01:16:37.136
- Danny, Danny! It's ok!
- I was here!

01:16:41.485 --> 01:16:42.896
It's alright.

01:16:51.472 --> 01:16:52.222
Elsa.

01:16:53.634 --> 01:16:54.998
Danny, hear...

01:16:55.118 --> 01:16:56.518
Danny, hear...Elsa!

01:17:21.631 --> 01:17:24.744
She's ok. She's ok.

01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:27.511
My God...,ok..

01:17:28.448 --> 01:17:30.758
I got you, I got you.

01:17:58.293 --> 01:17:59.143
Oh, no!

01:18:00.477 --> 01:18:02.462
Tommy!
Tommy!

01:18:11.825 --> 01:18:13.125
They're not gonna see us.

01:18:14.022 --> 01:18:14.772
What?

01:18:21.321 --> 01:18:23.037
They're not gonna see us,
Danny.

01:18:24.128 --> 01:18:25.428
They won't see us.

01:18:28.369 --> 01:18:30.219
I can't see, Tommy.

01:18:30.815 --> 01:18:33.615
I'm right at you, believe me.

01:18:34.048 --> 01:18:35.398
Close your eyes.

01:18:37.147 --> 01:18:38.447
They won't see us.

01:18:41.170 --> 01:18:42.597
They won't see us.

01:20:02.442 --> 01:20:03.842
<i> Are they gone?</i>

01:20:05.457 --> 01:20:06.857
They're gone.
