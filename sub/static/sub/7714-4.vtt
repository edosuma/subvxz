00:02.210 --> 00:03.669
l'm sorry, you guys
have probably noticed

00:03.753 --> 00:06.380
my stomach's a little
more sensitive lately.

00:06.464 --> 00:09.717
So, if you
wouldn't mind wearing
a little less perfume.

00:09.801 --> 00:11.760
And if your lunch
is especially pungent,

00:11.845 --> 00:13.595
maybe have it
in the break room.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.055
We would really
appreciate it.

00:15.140 --> 00:18.183
Pam is constantly throwing up
because of the pregnancy.

00:18.268 --> 00:22.062
If she eats something
the fetus doesn't like,
she is screwed.

00:22.147 --> 00:26.275
lt's amazing,
a three-ounce fetus
is calling the shots.

00:26.943 --> 00:28.736
lt's so badass.

00:29.279 --> 00:32.281
Phyllis,
if you could switch
to a different soap,

00:32.365 --> 00:35.451
just for a month or two.
Yours is kind of perfumey.

00:35.535 --> 00:37.244
Now this is getting
ridiculous.

00:37.328 --> 00:40.080
Oh, gee.
l'm sorry. l guess
l missed the meeting

00:40.165 --> 00:42.583
where we all voted
for you to get pregnant.

00:43.293 --> 00:48.213
No. l reserve the right
to peel my hard-boiled
eggs at my desk.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.924
All morning
l look forward to
my afternoon cigars.

00:51.009 --> 00:53.135
And l am not stopping
for anybody.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.554
l don't think
l'm asking
for too much.

00:55.638 --> 00:59.058
l guess it's just
the end of courtesy
in the workplace.

01:12.489 --> 01:13.572
(VOMlTlNG)

01:18.036 --> 01:21.121
Watching people get sick
always makes me sick.

01:21.206 --> 01:26.502
And, frankly,
so does talking
about it. So, wow.

01:55.865 --> 01:57.282
(lNAUDlBLE)

02:11.339 --> 02:12.422
Well, what
do you think?

02:12.507 --> 02:13.924
l spent
all morning
doing it.

02:14.008 --> 02:15.759
lt is really
special.

02:16.052 --> 02:20.055
Yeah, but aren't you
supposed to do that
to our. . . No. lt's great.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.267
Well, it's just a really
important day for me.

02:23.351 --> 02:25.227
Well, congrats.
Thanks.

02:25.603 --> 02:29.273
Dunder Mifflin Scranton
will be closed
today and Friday

02:29.357 --> 02:32.067
for a company wedding
in Niagara Falls.

02:32.152 --> 02:35.445
So please leave a message
and we'll get back to you
as soon as possible.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.197
Have a great day.

02:37.282 --> 02:40.951
Believe it or not, Kevin,
firecrackers are in
the "Don't" column.

02:41.035 --> 02:43.078
So, you're going to
provide them, then?

02:43.163 --> 02:44.746
No, this is
a firecracker-free
wedding.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.665
What the hell?
You've got to
be kidding me.

02:46.749 --> 02:48.834
Okay, all of these things
are important to remember,

02:48.918 --> 02:50.210
but the most
important thing

02:50.295 --> 02:51.545
is that no one
say anything

02:51.629 --> 02:53.172
about my pregnancy
at the wedding.

02:53.256 --> 02:54.923
Absolutely.
Because not
everyone knows

02:55.008 --> 02:56.300
and some people
might be offended.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.510
Decent people everywhere
will get offended.

02:58.595 --> 03:01.221
Well, we're thinking
of my grandmother,
who we haven't told

03:01.306 --> 03:02.598
and who is very
old-fashioned.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.766
Well, you're lucky
to have a grandmother.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.852
Some of us have to be
our own grandmother.

03:06.936 --> 03:10.189
You know, Angela,
you don't have to
come to the wedding.

03:10.273 --> 03:11.732
Really, Pam?
Yes, she does.
Yes, she does.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.442
We're all going to go
and we're going
to have a good time.

03:13.484 --> 03:15.402
Ow! He pinched me.
No.

03:15.486 --> 03:18.405
Next time
we're all in this room,
Jim and l will be married.

03:18.489 --> 03:19.531
We'll see.

03:19.616 --> 03:20.574
Thank you,

03:20.658 --> 03:21.825
Goodbye.
See you later.

Bye.

03:22.994 --> 03:26.663
Hey, and don't embarrass me
when we go to Niagara.

03:32.420 --> 03:35.714

You stole my joke.
Don't steal my joke.

03:35.798 --> 03:37.216
No, l didn't
steal your joke.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.634
Yes, l said
that yesterday.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.052
But you can say that
about anything.

03:40.136 --> 03:42.763
What happens in Accounting
stays in Accounting.

03:42.847 --> 03:43.889
Oh, yeah !

03:43.973 --> 03:46.433
No, no, no, no.
Please, please.
Dwight, that's my joke.

03:46.517 --> 03:48.518
Yeah, but it's so easy.
That's what l'm saying.
You can say. . .

03:48.603 --> 03:50.229
No, okay. This is what
l am talking about.

03:50.313 --> 03:54.441
When we leave here
and go up to
Niagara Falls,

03:54.525 --> 03:57.819
we are representing
Dunder Mifflin,
everyone.

03:57.904 --> 04:00.072
This is a very
important wedding
for this branch.

04:00.156 --> 04:01.740
The most important
wedding until
l get married.

04:01.824 --> 04:03.909
So l want you all
on your best behavior,

04:03.993 --> 04:05.160
or so help me God. . .

04:07.121 --> 04:11.083
So l will see you
up there in Viagra Falls.

04:13.962 --> 04:17.714
Pam and Jim's wedding
will be the single
best pickup destination

04:17.799 --> 04:20.259
in the history
of the universe.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.886
l stole the guest list
from Jim's desk,

04:22.971 --> 04:26.723
and l search-engined
every female on both
sides of the family.

04:26.849 --> 04:28.350
Get out of here.
Yes.

04:28.434 --> 04:29.768
Oh, my God, Dwight.

04:29.852 --> 04:33.939
For instance,
Pam's cousin,
Jocelyn Webster.

04:34.023 --> 04:35.315
There's a name.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.483
(LAUGHlNG)

04:36.567 --> 04:39.778
Two years ago,
she was selling
a mountain bike.

04:39.862 --> 04:41.280
Oh ! Well, tell me
about Jocelyn.

04:41.364 --> 04:42.406
Yes.

04:42.490 --> 04:43.532
What's she like?
l will, l will.

04:43.616 --> 04:47.619
Well, she's really
into mountain biking.
But not so much lately.

04:47.704 --> 04:48.704
Okay.

04:48.788 --> 04:51.373
She had a couple
hundred dollars
to spend.

04:51.457 --> 04:54.418
l mean, if she was able
to sell her bike.

04:56.879 --> 04:57.921
ls that all
you have on her?

04:58.006 --> 05:00.465
Well, if this is in fact
her, because it's a very
common name.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.092
Okay,
you're an idiot.

05:10.768 --> 05:15.147
People don't think of me
as one of the sharper
dressers in the office,

05:15.231 --> 05:18.233
but l'm going to
turn that around
at this wedding.

05:18.568 --> 05:22.362
I thought,
"How can I take it
to the next IeveI?"

to talk to?

so much cooler.

we're in a limo
and you're our driver.

be fair to leave Kelly
alone in the back.

really sweet and cute,
she smells like my mom.

me something neat.
Yeah?

She said everything
with the wedding
goes by so fast,

06:05.531 --> 06:08.200
we should try to
take mental pictures
of the high points.

06:08.284 --> 06:09.701
Oh. Wow.
That's cool.

06:09.786 --> 06:10.911

the mental pictures.

Really?
Yes. Let's just go.

No, no, no. This must be
some kind of mistake.

is under an M. Scott.

No. You know what,
l would say yes,
but you can't.

And l'll tell you why.

and things are
getting amorous,

if she looks in the bathroom

brushing your teeth with
butter and clay, okay?

and you have failed
