WEBVTT

00:01.468 --> 00:03.003
You know, folks, in Hamburg,

00:03.071 --> 00:06.407
I once saw a half-dozen Germans
berate a bus driver

00:06.474 --> 00:09.110
because he was
five minutes late.

00:09.177 --> 00:11.412
I mean, even today, you don't
have to squint too hard

00:11.479 --> 00:14.415
to see how Hitler got
those people to march.

00:14.482 --> 00:18.086
Having no chill, that's
a base tenet of fascism.

00:18.152 --> 00:20.521
Ooh, Charles, you know,
that sounded a little bit

00:20.588 --> 00:22.056
too Bill Maher as I said it.

00:22.123 --> 00:24.792
Can we cut that out.
Charles?

00:24.858 --> 00:27.628
Charles!
Are you listening to me?

00:27.695 --> 00:29.997
Try -- Try to pay attention
to the podcast, Charles.

00:30.064 --> 00:31.465
I mean, it is only your job.

00:31.532 --> 00:32.833
Jim!

00:32.900 --> 00:34.735
Jim! We can't be late.

00:34.802 --> 00:37.037
They're serious
about this Raj thing.

00:37.105 --> 00:39.073
Jim?

00:39.140 --> 00:40.874
**

00:40.941 --> 00:42.743
Ai! Ai!
Hijo de puta!

00:42.810 --> 00:45.113
**

00:45.179 --> 00:47.115
Oh, man.

00:47.181 --> 00:50.751
We hit the bar hard
when Uribe got in last night.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.853
You got in three days ago.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.556
Well, time flies
when you're on speed.

00:57.125 --> 00:59.693
I am celebrating
my retirement.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.963
Miss Jules, she cut me.

01:03.030 --> 01:04.798
Said I'm too slow
at everything.

01:04.864 --> 01:06.800
I'm sorry, man.

01:06.867 --> 01:09.603
So, you got any speed?

01:09.670 --> 01:11.405
No.
Hey, where's Jim?

01:11.472 --> 01:15.176
Brockmire, man, he party
hard nowadays, man.

01:15.243 --> 01:17.077
He eventually
left me behind.

01:17.145 --> 01:19.213
Why are you
wearing his jacket?

01:22.283 --> 01:25.753
We switched clothes, man,
when the mushroom kicked in.

01:25.819 --> 01:28.088
Uribe thought it was
a good idea at the time.

01:28.156 --> 01:30.691
Hey, do you want Uribe
to help you find Brockmire?

01:30.758 --> 01:32.560
No, that's fine.
I got this.

01:32.626 --> 01:33.961
Ai, that's better.
Ai.

01:34.027 --> 01:35.696
Yeah, I do this
all the time.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.097
Come on, Jim.
Where are you?

01:40.934 --> 01:42.270
* Right now *

01:42.336 --> 01:44.472
-* Oh, right now *
-Ooh.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.807
-* I said, oh, Lord *
-* Oh, Lord *

01:46.874 --> 01:48.776
* He's really gonna see me *

01:48.842 --> 01:50.244
* Right now *

01:50.311 --> 01:54.815
Wassup, world?
It's your girl, Cassie.

01:54.882 --> 01:57.518
Look who
I pulled from the bar.

02:01.722 --> 02:04.325
Old dude
from the Internet.

02:04.392 --> 02:07.828
Hey. I'll wait
for you here, man.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.501
Ugh.

02:13.567 --> 02:14.735
Where's Jim?

02:14.802 --> 02:16.003
I don't know where he is.

02:16.069 --> 02:17.671
I kicked him out
an hour ago.

02:17.738 --> 02:20.808
Tried to eat my ass almost
as soon as we got in bed.

02:20.874 --> 02:23.811
Ha! That's a reward
for a job well-done.

02:23.877 --> 02:26.013
You don't start a big meal
with dessert.

02:26.079 --> 02:27.948
Where did he say
he was going?

02:28.015 --> 02:29.417
Said he was going
to some bar

02:29.483 --> 02:32.553
that cuts out the middleman
of fun and conversation.

02:32.620 --> 02:35.489
**

02:35.556 --> 02:39.092
Pbht! What the hell
took you so long?

02:39.159 --> 02:41.229
Your breath
smells like ass.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.863
Oh, I wish.

02:42.930 --> 02:49.337
**

02:49.403 --> 02:51.905
Crawdaddys go on a long
road trip tomorrow -- two weeks.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.574
Yeah, no, I don't care
who messed them up.

02:53.641 --> 02:55.175
I'm not paying for them.

02:55.243 --> 02:57.345
They're supposed to say
"Brockmire," not Brock-m-i-e-r.

02:57.411 --> 03:00.214
He's not French.
I expect a full refund.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.950
Crawdaddys threatening
here in the second.

03:06.086 --> 03:08.456
Mm-hmm. Oh, no, I have
the receipt on me right here.

03:08.522 --> 03:09.890
Hold on.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.559
And that is the first
run of the ball game,

03:11.625 --> 03:13.661
and you know what that means,
Crawdaddy fans.

03:13.727 --> 03:16.129
It's time
for the Crawdaddy Ditty.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.667
Press the button.

03:21.068 --> 03:23.237
There it is,
the Crawdaddy Ditty.

03:23.304 --> 03:26.574
You know what? Hold on.
I have a call on the other line.

03:26.640 --> 03:30.177
Hey.
How was the flight, Mom?

03:30.244 --> 03:32.546
Yeah, well,
I have some good news.

03:32.613 --> 03:38.252
I got us a reservation at
a Michelin star restaurant.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.620
Yeah, no, not like
the tire people.

03:39.687 --> 03:44.191
It's just a way of saying
it's a fancy restaurant.

03:44.258 --> 03:46.193
Yeah, no,
Dad's gonna meet us there.

03:46.260 --> 03:49.297
Hey, hey, hey, excuse me.
Hi.

03:49.363 --> 03:51.565
Could you please bubble-wrap
these before you send them?

03:51.632 --> 03:54.368
We've gotten a few complaints.
Thank you.

03:54.435 --> 03:57.871
Yeah -- No, uh,
I-I agree with you.

03:57.938 --> 04:00.841
There's nothing fancy
about tires.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.009
There isn't gonna be
any tires there!

04:02.075 --> 04:03.777
I'm -- I love you, Mom.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.479
I'll see you later.
Goodbye.

04:05.546 --> 04:08.248
You said you needed
a little bit of office space.

04:08.316 --> 04:10.584
You're running a goddamn
mail-order sweatshop!

04:10.651 --> 04:12.653
And these guys keep
stealing hot dogs.

04:12.720 --> 04:13.987
You know what?

04:14.054 --> 04:16.557
I'll give you $75 extra
a week for the rent,

04:16.624 --> 04:19.993
and everybody in here
gets free hot dogs.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.928
That's a lot of cash.

04:21.995 --> 04:25.366
Well, credit cards don't make
problems go away this fast.

04:27.701 --> 04:30.438
Hey, wait, was that
the second out or the third?

04:30.504 --> 04:31.639
Shit.

04:31.705 --> 04:34.342
Top of the third
is brought to you by...

04:34.408 --> 04:35.343
Shit!

04:35.409 --> 04:38.879
...by -- by...

04:38.946 --> 04:40.314
Delphina's Po' Boys.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.282
Serving New Orleans
for over 80 years.

04:42.350 --> 04:46.887
Every bite will make you scream,
"Oh, boy, what a po' boy!"

04:46.954 --> 04:48.556
Seems strange
that lasted 80 years

04:48.622 --> 04:51.024
with a slogan that rhymes
"boy" with "boy," doesn't it?

04:51.091 --> 04:53.193
But, uh, that just means
their sandwiches

04:53.260 --> 04:54.862
are mighty tasty, folks.

04:54.928 --> 04:58.165
You're way off
your game today.

04:58.231 --> 05:01.001
Johnson steps in.
He's batting .255.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.204
All right, so this driver

05:04.271 --> 05:05.939
will take you and Uribe
wherever you want to go.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.475
Eh, I'm not seeing
Pedro tonight.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.743
He's got a date with
this professor from Tulane.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.645
Boy, that guy
loves academics.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.814
Keeps dragging me around
to all these college bars

05:13.881 --> 05:17.084
so we can find a big-ass woman
with a big-ass mind

05:17.150 --> 05:18.752
to sit
on his big-ass face.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.388
Well, you won't be alone,

05:20.454 --> 05:22.556
because the driver will be
with you for 24 straight hours,

05:22.623 --> 05:24.992
because as you know,
tonight's my night off.

05:25.058 --> 05:27.395
Whoa, first I'm
hearing of this.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.129
I've been telling you
for a month.

05:29.196 --> 05:31.064
You can't tell me.
You have to write it down.

05:31.131 --> 05:34.435
I'm -- I'm a visual
listener, Charles.

05:36.136 --> 05:37.738
Well,
you can't put it there.

05:37.805 --> 05:40.474
You have to put it on my
drinking hand or I don't see it.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.075
Come on.
Just -- Please.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.211
Hang out with me tonight,
and I'll pay you double.

05:44.277 --> 05:46.547
I'm head
of your corporation.

05:46.614 --> 05:47.681
So?

05:47.748 --> 05:49.149
That means I pay you.

05:49.216 --> 05:51.284
Yeah, only 'cause you don't
trust me with the finances,

05:51.351 --> 05:53.053
Charles, which is
beyond insulting.

05:53.120 --> 05:56.223
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just give me this much.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.459
Come on.
Karen Hill big.

05:58.526 --> 06:00.528
I don't know
what that means.

06:00.594 --> 06:03.330
Inexcusable that you haven't
seen, uh, "Goodfellas" yet.

06:03.397 --> 06:04.698
Come on.
Slip it in there.

06:04.765 --> 06:07.535
No foreplay needed.
Ooh, that feels nice.

06:07.601 --> 06:11.605
**

06:11.672 --> 06:13.641
* Walking the streets
of New Orleans *

06:13.707 --> 06:17.511
* I see these trumpet players,
tuba players, drummers *

06:17.578 --> 06:20.514
* On the street corner
tapping their feet *

06:20.581 --> 06:23.283
* Bobbing their heads
to the...beat *

06:23.350 --> 06:26.286
* 'Cause no matter what they
say, this is our world *

06:26.353 --> 06:27.888
* We come from the bottom *

06:27.955 --> 06:29.423
* Now we all... *

06:29.490 --> 06:31.792
* Keep it locked down,
this is ours now *

06:31.859 --> 06:33.160
* Game's over... *

06:33.226 --> 06:34.628
The birthday boy
is here.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.764
Give me them 604s!

06:36.830 --> 06:38.466
Podcast, I've been
meaning to ask you.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.901
What's your podcast about?
-It's the drunk ramblings

06:40.968 --> 06:42.603
of an old white dude
who drinks too much.

06:42.670 --> 06:45.372
-Yeah.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.307
I should do a podcast
about, like,

06:47.374 --> 06:49.810
shoes and clothes and shit.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.278
You could.

06:51.344 --> 06:54.815
You could call it
"Dipped and Laced."

06:54.882 --> 06:58.285
Can you talk into a microphone
for like an hour straight?

06:58.351 --> 07:00.387
All I do is talk shit.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.422
This is actually
a really good idea, Dave.

07:02.490 --> 07:04.925
I have some time right now
if you want --

07:04.992 --> 07:06.093
Let's do it.

07:06.159 --> 07:08.562
-Hold on.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.498
All right, I got to --
I got to take this.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.299
Yeah, sure.

07:12.365 --> 07:13.734
Ugh.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.068
Jim: Hello

07:15.135 --> 07:16.604
I thought I took my uppers,

07:16.670 --> 07:18.772
but I must have taken
my downers.

07:18.839 --> 07:24.044
I'm in a bathtub, and I can't
really lift my head.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.345
Surprise!

07:27.447 --> 07:30.718
You thought I forgot
your birthday, didn't you?

07:30.784 --> 07:33.754
Wrote it down on my coke dollar
so I wouldn't forget.

07:33.821 --> 07:36.056
August 15, Charles' birthday.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.025
Toot toot!

07:38.091 --> 07:39.392
I thought you were dying.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.663
Come on, Charles.
I was just messing with you.

07:42.730 --> 07:44.031
I got a big night planned.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.667
I got two bottles
of 18-year-old scotch.

07:46.734 --> 07:47.735
Those are for me.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.803
I got you a lovely
birthday cake,

07:49.870 --> 07:51.572
which I've already
eaten my half of.

07:51.639 --> 07:54.742
And quite frankly,
it isn't sitting very well.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.511
And, ooh, I got you a big,
old bag of cocaine,

07:57.578 --> 07:59.613
which is how I remembered your
birthday in the first place

07:59.680 --> 08:03.216
and, uh, yeah, that --
well, that's also for me.

08:05.385 --> 08:09.089
So the only thing you've
gotten me for my birthday

08:09.156 --> 08:11.091
is a half-eaten
birthday cake.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.593
No.

08:12.660 --> 08:16.764
I also got you Chastity,
who is a lovely sex worker,

08:16.830 --> 08:19.633
and she's here
to pop your cherry!

08:19.700 --> 08:20.701
There she is!

08:20.768 --> 08:23.671
Damn, man!
You ruined that bathroom.

08:23.737 --> 08:26.874
I think I already admitted that
the cake was not sitting well.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.109
-Touché.
-Charles, Chastity.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.178
Now, I want you to know --
Hey --

08:31.244 --> 08:33.380
I went to great lengths
to make sure

08:33.446 --> 08:36.349
that this was
the perfect woman for you.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.586
So you already had
sex with her.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.788
You know, Charles, come on,
that'd be weird.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.121
It's your birthday.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.091
You're gonna have sex
with her first,

08:44.157 --> 08:45.893
and then I'm going
to have sex with her.

08:45.959 --> 08:48.528
And then you go and then I go
and then you go and then I go.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.731
But nobody comes
except for Chastity, of course,

08:50.798 --> 08:53.300
because, you know, we're --
we're both gentlemen.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.902
Can't wait.

08:54.968 --> 08:57.504
Is this really how you imagined
me losing my virginity?

08:57.571 --> 09:00.207
Yes.
It's weird how close this is.

09:00.273 --> 09:01.675
We're both sitting
on this couch

09:01.742 --> 09:03.811
and I had this exact
level of erection.

09:03.877 --> 09:08.181
I mean, I'm -- I'm giving myself
déjà vu with this thing.

09:08.248 --> 09:10.684
I'm not doing this.

09:10.751 --> 09:13.654
Well, I think you're hurting
Chastity's feelings, Charles.

09:13.721 --> 09:17.257
Oh, no, no, I've been
in this game a long time.

09:17.324 --> 09:20.493
I got thick skin.
And loose skin.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.362
He's hurting my feelings,
all right?

09:22.429 --> 09:23.697
Charles, come on.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.398
What's more important
than spending time

09:25.465 --> 09:27.601
with your best friend
on your

09:27.668 --> 09:30.337
Hanging out with my family.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.839
I'm having dinner with them.

09:31.905 --> 09:35.408
You're having dinner with your
family and didn't invite me?

09:35.475 --> 09:37.110
How can you do that?

09:37.177 --> 09:39.346
Because they hate you.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.215
My mom still calls us
moving out of Morristown

09:42.282 --> 09:43.583
"the kidnapping."

09:43.651 --> 09:45.986
And my dad thinks
you're my sugar daddy.

09:46.053 --> 09:48.288
It took them a whole year
to even talk to me again.

09:48.355 --> 09:51.124
I'm not gonna let you
ruin that by...

09:51.191 --> 09:53.193
being you.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.395
Now, what the hell
is that su--

10:00.834 --> 10:02.402
God damn, man!

10:02.469 --> 10:04.838
How can it smell the same
coming out the other end?

10:04.905 --> 10:07.374
Oh, shit. Oh, God.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.810
All -- All over your nice,
new sneakers.

10:09.877 --> 10:13.914
I'm so -- God damn it!
I got to cut back on the sugar.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.684
It's my one true vice.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.819
Oh!

10:22.222 --> 10:23.490
All right, Charles,

10:23.556 --> 10:26.026
I will not go to your
precious family dinner.

10:26.093 --> 10:27.828
You weren't invited.

10:27.895 --> 10:31.431
You and I both know
that was not gonna stop me.

10:31.498 --> 10:34.534
But you have to do
something for me,

10:34.601 --> 10:37.504
and that something
is named Chastity.

10:39.272 --> 10:40.874
Oh.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.475
Is it go time?

10:42.542 --> 10:44.444
'Cause I just popped
a toaster strudel in,

10:44.511 --> 10:47.514
and I'm gonna need five.

10:47.580 --> 10:51.051
Also, someone's been
doubling up on your frosting

10:51.118 --> 10:54.855
'cause y'all are low.

10:54.922 --> 10:56.456
What?
It wasn't me.

10:56.523 --> 10:59.359
-Yeah.

11:05.032 --> 11:08.936
Hey, can I just get a few
things off my chest first?

11:09.002 --> 11:10.270
Sure, sweetie.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.272
I mean, half my job
is listening.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.775
Um, I didn't have
the best childhood.

11:14.842 --> 11:18.311
I barely ever saw my dad.
My mom is extremely needy.

11:18.378 --> 11:21.648
And my stepdad
is just the worst.

11:21.715 --> 11:23.851
So when I saw the chance
to escape, I took it.

11:23.917 --> 11:26.754
I knew New Orleans would be
much better than whatever life

11:26.820 --> 11:28.989
I had back home,
and I was right.

11:29.056 --> 11:30.357
It's really great.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.025
And I set this whole
birthday dinner thing

11:32.092 --> 11:33.827
to show my family
how well I'm doing.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.829
And you're eating
another toaster strudel.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.565
What?
You don't want to have sex.

11:38.631 --> 11:40.433
We don't have to.
It's fine.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.736
Great! Nice!

11:42.803 --> 11:45.305
So you'll tell Jim
we had sex?

11:45.372 --> 11:47.240
Mm-hmm. For $300.

11:47.307 --> 11:48.341
What?

11:48.408 --> 11:50.844
He paid you $150.

11:50.911 --> 11:54.314
Why am I paying you
double to lie?

11:54.381 --> 11:58.451
'Cause lying is a sin,
and I'm a godly woman.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.387
You're a prostitute.

12:00.453 --> 12:03.190
There's prostitutes
in the Bible.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.492
You know what?

12:05.558 --> 12:07.294
You're right.
I can't argue with that.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.830
You're absolutely right.

12:09.897 --> 12:10.898
Here you go.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.900
Pleasure doing
business with you.

12:12.966 --> 12:13.901
Happy birthday!

12:15.535 --> 12:17.137
**

12:17.204 --> 12:19.339
Hmm. Nice stuff.
They got some...

12:19.406 --> 12:21.674
-Hey.
-Hey.

12:29.649 --> 12:31.384
Nice of you
to show up, Junior.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.486
Yeah, well,
it's, uh, 7:00 p.m.

12:33.553 --> 12:35.688
I said 7:00.
I'm exactly on time.

12:35.755 --> 12:40.427
Charlotte and Charlyn,
what is "exactly on time"?

12:40.493 --> 12:41.795
Both: Late, sir.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.063
Thank you.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.032
Well, I apologize, Dad.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.067
I'm happy you could make it up
from Mississippi.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.970
Yeah, well, the girls
wanted to see New Orleans.

12:50.037 --> 12:54.507
So we went on a swamp boat tour,
and we saw a alligator farm,

12:54.574 --> 12:56.676
and then we saw some
other historical landmarks.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.378
You did all that
since this morning?

12:58.445 --> 13:00.914
No, we've been here
for four days.

13:00.981 --> 13:04.284
Oh...kay.

13:04.351 --> 13:07.587
My two favorite
Charles'sss.

13:07.654 --> 13:08.889
Terry, where's Mom?

13:08.956 --> 13:10.790
Oh, she's outside
parking the rental car.

13:10.858 --> 13:13.693
I drove down, but she's better
at parallel parking than I am.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.562
People honk,
I get flustered.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.398
Terry, why didn't you stay
to hold open the door for me?

13:18.465 --> 13:20.200
I nearly sprained my wrist.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.735
Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry, baby.
Let me get you some ice.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.939
No, I don't need any ice.
I will heal from the pain.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.942
I always heal
from the pain.

13:29.009 --> 13:34.247
Speaking of pain,
let me see my birthday boy.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.116
Hmm! Oh!

13:38.618 --> 13:40.888
I see you survived
your kidnapping.

13:40.954 --> 13:43.423
Hi, Mom.
It's great to see you.

13:43.490 --> 13:46.026
-Mm-hmm.
-God damn.

13:48.929 --> 13:52.499
-Ooh!
-Bobbi, you still got it, girl.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.469
If I wasn't married,

13:56.536 --> 13:59.106
I'd say we run that thing
back one more time tonight.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.641
Well, if you weren't
married, I'd let you.

14:07.747 --> 14:11.284
So, this is the restaurant
the tire people recommend.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.585
Don't worry about it.

14:12.652 --> 14:15.222
I know it's my birthday,
but it's my treat.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.924
It's my gift to you guys.

14:16.990 --> 14:19.993
So your older man friend gave
you some walking

14:20.060 --> 14:23.830
I, uh, I told you, Dad, I make
my own money from the podcast.

14:23.897 --> 14:26.666
I ain't never seen no podcast
that pay this much.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.635
How many podcasts
have you seen?

14:28.701 --> 14:30.070
Don't question me, boy.

14:30.137 --> 14:31.804
Hey, do they have that
pre

14:31.871 --> 14:34.207
I'm starvin' bajarvin'.
-Oh, my g-- Okay, can we --

14:34.274 --> 14:38.078
Look, we haven't been in the
same room in a very long time.

14:38.145 --> 14:40.747
I just want all of us to enjoy
each other's company.

14:40.813 --> 14:43.650
Please?
I miss you guys.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.519
Aww.
I miss you, too, baby.

14:46.586 --> 14:50.257
Your sisters were
excited to see you.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.591
And I was, too.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.193
Baby, look, I know
we can be hard on you,

14:53.260 --> 14:56.229
but it's just because
we love you so much.

14:56.296 --> 15:02.835
I've settled for...
so many things in my life.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.638
But I never want you
to settle for anything

15:05.705 --> 15:09.176
other than your best life.
-Thanks, Mom.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.778
There they all are.
So good to see all of you.

15:11.844 --> 15:14.547
I'm Jim. Charles has told me
so much about all of you.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.483
Hey! Come on!
Let's talk for a second.

15:16.549 --> 15:17.985
I thought we had a deal.

15:18.051 --> 15:21.088
We did, Charles, but you did
not fuck your end of it.

15:21.154 --> 15:24.224
I paid Chastity $300,
and she told me the truth.

15:24.291 --> 15:28.261
So we paid her $750 just
to eat all of our strudel?

15:28.328 --> 15:30.030
Apparently.

15:30.097 --> 15:33.000
Bobbi, Charles tells me
that you are from Fayetteville.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.734
I am from right
across the border

15:34.801 --> 15:36.169
in Barry County, Missouri.

15:36.236 --> 15:37.270
Can you believe that?

15:37.337 --> 15:38.805
We're both children
of the Ozarks.

15:38.871 --> 15:40.940
I mean, we're
practically cousins.

15:41.008 --> 15:43.076
Mm-hmm.
I only have one white cousin,

15:43.143 --> 15:44.744
and his name
is Dan Marino.

15:44.811 --> 15:45.945
And you must be
the sergeant.

15:46.013 --> 15:47.814
Sir, it is such a pleasure
to meet you.

15:47.880 --> 15:51.118
I want to thank you
for your service.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.553
So you're my son's
fancy friend.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.255
That is
exactly who I am.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.890
Now, I know that you're all
very worried about Charles,

15:57.957 --> 16:01.228
but I want to assure you
that he is just doing fantastic.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.763
He's so happy that you all
came here to celebrate with him,

16:03.830 --> 16:08.568
but really, what is
a celebration without a toast?

16:08.635 --> 16:10.503
Come on in.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.005
Champagne for everybody.

16:12.072 --> 16:14.974
Now, this is on me.
Thank you, darling.

16:15.042 --> 16:17.644
Make sure everyone
gets one, now.

16:17.710 --> 16:20.613
All right.
To Charles --

16:20.680 --> 16:25.085
Well, if it ain't the ass
eater extraordinaire.

16:25.152 --> 16:28.088
You didn't even kiss me
on the mouth first.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.123
What kind of man
goes straight for the ass

16:30.190 --> 16:33.126
before they kiss you
on the mouth?

16:33.193 --> 16:35.128
One that thought he was
in a safe space

16:35.195 --> 16:37.064
to try a little
something different.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.199
-You --
-All right, okay.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.271
What the hell
was that in there?

16:44.337 --> 16:46.005
Hey, is it my fault
that the rectum

16:46.073 --> 16:48.308
has the same amount of pleasure
receptors as the clitoris?

16:48.375 --> 16:50.777
It isn't. I mean, blame God
or natural selection,

16:50.843 --> 16:52.279
depending
on your belief system.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.247
See, this is exactly why
I didn't want you here.

16:54.314 --> 16:55.848
I'm trying to patch
whatever relationship

16:55.915 --> 16:57.317
I have left
with the family,

16:57.384 --> 16:58.951
and you're just gonna
come in here and ruin it.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.087
You're almost
as bad as Terry!

17:00.153 --> 17:01.621
What do y'all have
against that guy?

17:01.688 --> 17:03.690
He seems like a very
sweet man to me.

17:03.756 --> 17:07.560
Never, ever
take Terry's side.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.128
Never. If you're
gonna stay here,

17:09.195 --> 17:11.030
you're gonna be
on your best behavior.

17:11.098 --> 17:14.401
You understand me?
Not a word.

17:14.467 --> 17:15.835
-I got it.
-Not a word.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.369
-How do you want me to --
-Jim!

17:17.436 --> 17:18.738
-Okay.
-Ah, ah, ah!

17:18.805 --> 17:19.771
All right.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.174
Thank you.

17:23.076 --> 17:26.045
Here's the happy couple.
Did y'all kiss and make up?

17:26.113 --> 17:28.815
Sorry about that.
Sorry about all of this.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.950
Now, it's just exactly
what we expected,

17:31.017 --> 17:33.586
which is why
we got you this.

17:33.653 --> 17:36.089
Happy birthday, son.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.691
-It's a plane ticket.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.793
Now, look, I already got
two good kids,

17:40.860 --> 17:42.795
so whatever happens to you,
I'm fine.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.464
But you're all
your mother has,

17:44.531 --> 17:46.666
which is why you ought to be
at home taking care of her.

17:46.733 --> 17:51.238
Charles, I-I haven't been doing
well since you left, Charles.

17:51.304 --> 17:54.474
I...

17:54.541 --> 17:55.775
I have cancer.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.944
Oh, my God, Mom.

17:58.010 --> 18:00.947
Emotional cancer
caused by you.

18:01.013 --> 18:02.849
-Oh, my God! Mom!

18:02.915 --> 18:04.717
When you left,
a sadness took over me,

18:04.784 --> 18:06.686
and you're the only one
who can make it go away!

18:06.753 --> 18:08.621
Well, why can't Terry
take care of you?

18:08.688 --> 18:10.290
Terry can't even get bread.

18:10.357 --> 18:11.391
I'm hungry.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.193
See, that's why you need
to be at home.

18:13.260 --> 18:14.361
I am home.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.296
I don't understand how you
turned out this way.

18:16.363 --> 18:18.731
You know I need you, and you
won't even consider me,

18:18.798 --> 18:20.066
your mother.

18:20.133 --> 18:22.302
Fed you every day,
kept you in nice clothes,

18:22.369 --> 18:24.771
kept a roof over
your head all by myself!

18:24.837 --> 18:27.840
And now look at you --
ungrateful and selfish!

18:27.907 --> 18:29.142
That -- That's enough.
I'm sorry.

18:29.209 --> 18:30.977
I promised Charles
I wouldn't say anything,

18:31.043 --> 18:32.645
but I cannot sit idly by

18:32.712 --> 18:34.714
and listen to you
badmouth this young man.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.883
Now, Sergeant,
all due respect, sir,

18:36.949 --> 18:38.318
but you haven't
been in his life.

18:38.385 --> 18:40.620
You have no right
to criticize his choices.

18:40.687 --> 18:43.456
You also seem to be turning your
girls into very strange robots.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.992
They have not blinked one time,
and I'm terrified.

18:46.058 --> 18:47.394
Thank you
for your service.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.862
Terry, hey, very difficult
to respect anybody

18:49.929 --> 18:51.298
who has no respect
for themselves.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.766
No offense to you.
-Oh, none taken.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.402
You should be offended
by that, Terry.

18:55.468 --> 18:58.137
That's the whole point.
No, never mind. Never mind.

18:58.205 --> 19:02.409
Madam, you are an emotionally
manipulative narcissist.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.677
I know.
No, 'cause that's what I am.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.913
Now I see why Charles was drawn
to me in the first place.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.249
This is all he's known
his entire life.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.117
Except with Jim,
I get paid.

19:11.184 --> 19:12.685
You're darn right he does.

19:12.752 --> 19:15.722
This genius here helped me
build a podcast juggernaut.

19:15.788 --> 19:18.891
Go ahead. Tell them how much
money you made last year.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.560
$600,000.

19:20.627 --> 19:24.764
600 thousa

19:24.831 --> 19:25.965
I made $400,000.

19:26.032 --> 19:27.667
The 60/40 split
is in your favor?

19:27.734 --> 19:29.068
I do most of the work.

19:29.135 --> 19:30.970
Oh, we're gonna put a pin
in this conversation.

19:31.037 --> 19:32.505
No, we're gonna
revisit it later.

19:32.572 --> 19:35.074
Well, now I have some things
I'd like to say.

19:35.141 --> 19:37.277
That jacket you always wear
looks like the carpet

19:37.344 --> 19:39.479
at a motel
that charges by the hour.

19:39.546 --> 19:43.015
Only a degenerate and a fool
would eat a stranger's ass.

19:43.082 --> 19:45.385
And any man who does must
be compensating

19:45.452 --> 19:47.220
for his tiny pecker!

19:47.287 --> 19:50.857
I have been told that I am
exactly average by sex workers

19:50.923 --> 19:54.093
around the world
in 16 different languages, okay?

19:54.160 --> 19:55.928
So now that we both
had our turn --

19:55.995 --> 19:57.364
Oh, no, I'm just warming up.

19:57.430 --> 19:58.998
Let me tell you something else,
Mr. Announcer.

19:59.065 --> 20:02.101
Don't bother.
We're leaving.

20:02.168 --> 20:03.670
I'm sorry for the way I left,

20:03.736 --> 20:06.005
but this dinner
made me realize why I did it.

20:06.072 --> 20:09.842
Now I'm gonna go back
to my house that I own.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.478
I love you all.
Except Terry.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.246
Ch-- Hey, is the house
in your name, too?

20:13.313 --> 20:15.315
It is, isn't it? Because we're
gonna have to have

20:15.382 --> 20:16.883
a serious talk
about my finances

20:16.949 --> 20:18.851
IN what I thought
was a partnership.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.390
Thanks for standing up
for me.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.825
Well, Charles,
I know what it's like

20:25.892 --> 20:27.494
to not be seen
by your family.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.462
And, you know, I don't
always give you

20:29.529 --> 20:30.897
the credit that you deserve,

20:30.963 --> 20:34.267
but, uh, as a man
with a prodigious ego,

20:34.334 --> 20:38.538
let me pay you the highest
possible compliment that I can.

20:38.605 --> 20:42.041
Charles, you are almost
as talented as I am.

20:44.677 --> 20:45.812
Wow.

20:45.878 --> 20:47.514
Yeah.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.581
Well, thanks, Jim.

20:48.648 --> 20:51.117
I'm gonna go to bed.
-Whoa, whoa.

20:51.183 --> 20:53.286
I got one
more gift for you.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.254
Jim, if there's another
prostitute in here,

20:55.322 --> 20:57.490
I swear I'm gonna
lose my shit.

20:57.557 --> 20:58.891
I --

21:00.593 --> 21:01.761
Hmm.

21:01.828 --> 21:02.962
604s?

21:03.029 --> 21:04.297
Oh, yeah.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.799
**

21:06.866 --> 21:09.101
I thought I got the last pair
of 11s in the city.

21:09.168 --> 21:13.373
What can I say?
I have friends in high places.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.607
Did you call Joe Buck?

21:14.674 --> 21:16.409
I called Joe Buck.

21:16.476 --> 21:23.483
**
