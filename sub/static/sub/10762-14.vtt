WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:11.878
Mimsy, wait!

00:11.878 --> 00:14.247
Please
I can explain!
Oh, don't bother.

00:14.247 --> 00:17.083
And I bet you don't
even have Tourette's Syndrome!

00:17.584 --> 00:18.585
Poop!

00:18.585 --> 00:20.120
Hell! Damn!

00:20.120 --> 00:21.588
Oh!

00:24.591 --> 00:26.092
Lose my number!

00:26.092 --> 00:27.427
Chef Etienne!

00:27.427 --> 00:28.895
Oh, dear God.

00:28.895 --> 00:32.198
I hope you're happy.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.566
Me?

00:33.566 --> 00:36.069
You're the one who suggested that flaming kabobs

00:36.569 --> 00:38.304
might lend a festive air.

00:38.304 --> 00:43.376
I didn't know Ben Corbett'toupee would go up like that.

00:43.610 --> 00:45.111
Oh, quiet, both of you.

00:45.111 --> 00:46.112
It's done.

00:46.112 --> 00:49.549
Buon giorno!

00:49.883 --> 00:51.384
NILES:
Party's over, Dad.

00:51.384 --> 00:53.353
You mean, I'm
not the Count anymore?

00:53.353 --> 00:54.721
Afraid not.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.623
Why is it that we can't seem

00:56.623 --> 00:58.958
to pull off
a simple dinner party?

00:58.958 --> 01:01.261
Because you always go overboard.

01:01.261 --> 01:03.129
Yes, but this one
was bare bones!

01:03.129 --> 01:04.464
Simplicity itself.

01:04.464 --> 01:06.800
One of your goats
just threw up in the kitchen.

01:09.302 --> 01:10.303
(goat bleating)

01:10.303 --> 01:11.304
Oh!

01:16.576 --> 01:19.079
NILES:
Oh, hello.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.081
How goes
the installation?

01:21.081 --> 01:23.516
Well, we had to put in
a transformer for the
DC,

01:23.516 --> 01:26.352
so after we pull the wires, brace the beam,

01:26.352 --> 01:27.620
she'll be ready to roll.

01:27.620 --> 01:28.621
Ah.

01:31.624 --> 01:32.625
Daphne, Daphne.

01:34.127 --> 01:35.895
You know the Mike Shaw
painting

01:35.895 --> 01:37.430
that I'm donating
to the museum?

01:37.430 --> 01:40.166
Frasier suggested we throw
a farewell dinner party for it.

01:40.166 --> 01:41.701
We've invited
some fellow collectors.

01:42.168 --> 01:45.305
Um, Niles,
I've been thinking.

01:45.305 --> 01:48.308
Come and sit down, darling.

01:51.311 --> 01:52.278
Maybe it's time

01:52.278 --> 01:54.747
you stopped throwing
dinner parties

01:54.747 --> 01:56.049
with your brother.

01:56.049 --> 01:57.884
What?

01:57.884 --> 02:00.820
You don't exactly have
the best track record.

02:00.820 --> 02:03.256
Well, throwing dinner parties
is an art.

02:03.256 --> 02:05.091
It takes time to perfect.

02:05.091 --> 02:07.360
No.

02:07.360 --> 02:08.360
But...

02:08.360 --> 02:10.864
No.

02:11.364 --> 02:13.299
No, it has to stop.

02:13.299 --> 02:17.203
Maybe you and I should try
throwing a party together.

02:17.203 --> 02:19.706
You and me?

02:19.706 --> 02:20.707
It's such a big step.

02:21.207 --> 02:22.041
Are you sure?

02:24.277 --> 02:27.714
Maybe it's time we
entertained as a couple.

02:28.214 --> 02:30.483
Oh, thank you, darling.

02:30.483 --> 02:31.718
Excuse me.

02:31.718 --> 02:33.586
It's after 4:00.
What if I finish this tomorrow?

02:33.586 --> 02:34.888
Well, I suppose...

02:34.888 --> 02:36.222
Oh, no,
you don't.

02:36.222 --> 02:38.057
You said one day
when I hired you

02:38.057 --> 02:39.559
and that's what it's going to be.

02:39.559 --> 02:40.560
So get crackin
g

02:40.560 --> 02:42.061
'cause something's going to be hanging

02:42.061 --> 02:43.897
from that rafter
by the end of the day.

02:45.231 --> 02:46.566
Yes, ma'am.

02:50.036 --> 02:52.539
Daphne, you handled that
so masterfully

02:52.539 --> 02:54.040
as if he weren't wearing

02:54.541 --> 02:56.543
that authoritative
tool belt at all.

02:59.479 --> 03:01.981
Oh, Niles, Niles.
Thank goodness you're here.

03:01.981 --> 03:04.918
I am simply percolating
with party ideas.

03:04.918 --> 03:05.919
(sighs)

03:05.919 --> 03:08.254
Listen.
Have you thought
of inviting

03:08.254 --> 03:09.088
the artist himself?

03:09.589 --> 03:10.890
He lives in town, you know?

03:10.890 --> 03:12.659
Yes, I extended an invitation
through his gallery

03:12.659 --> 03:13.626
but he declined.

03:13.626 --> 03:14.627
Oh. That's too bad.

03:15.094 --> 03:16.095
Well, then, I have come up

03:16.095 --> 03:19.132
with the perfect entertainment
for our little art crowd.

03:19.632 --> 03:22.135
It's a radical tableau
vivant troupe.

03:24.070 --> 03:25.138
I don't know.

03:25.138 --> 03:27.640
But they do provide
smocks and shower caps

03:27.640 --> 03:29.075
so we're covered.

03:29.409 --> 03:33.379
Frasier, Daphne and I
are throwing the party.

03:39.986 --> 03:40.987
Daphne.

03:42.855 --> 03:44.424
Ah, fine. Suit yourself.

03:44.424 --> 03:45.925
It's your painting.

03:45.925 --> 03:48.895
I suppose I could just whip up
my signature dish.

03:48.895 --> 03:52.198
Daphne's handling the food.

03:54.500 --> 03:55.501
Lovely.

03:55.501 --> 03:57.503
So you'll be serving
those sad brown chunks

03:57.503 --> 03:59.505
that make their way
from plate to napkin

03:59.505 --> 04:00.974
bypassing mouth completely.

04:02.408 --> 04:04.978
It's called
"Piccadilly Beef"

04:05.478 --> 04:06.980
and I talked her
out of it, thank God.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.817
The whole thing's
being catered.

04:10.817 --> 04:12.318
We're having Cornish
game hens

04:12.318 --> 04:14.320
wild rice stuffing,
wonderful sides

04:14.320 --> 04:15.255
and all heat and serve.

04:15.588 --> 04:18.156
Stuffin'!

04:18.156 --> 04:19.659
Lovely.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.161
I think you'd be happy
to be just a guest for once.

04:22.595 --> 04:23.997
Just a guest!

04:24.264 --> 04:25.832
In my brother's home.

04:25.832 --> 04:28.268
I've never been
just a guest before.

04:28.635 --> 04:31.638
Before, I always felt
like family.

04:32.005 --> 04:34.574
Oh, look,
here she is now.

04:34.574 --> 04:37.076
The hostess
with the mostest.

04:37.577 --> 04:38.845
I see Niles told you.

04:39.078 --> 04:40.146
Yes. I'm sorry

04:40.146 --> 04:42.148
I won't be attending
your debut soiree, Daphne.

04:42.649 --> 04:45.084
I hope that doesn't throw off your seating plan.

04:45.451 --> 04:48.454
It's going to be a buffet.

04:48.821 --> 04:50.390
Buffet!

04:55.561 --> 04:59.799
Well, if you should
need any help

04:59.799 --> 05:01.834
you know my phone number.

05:02.035 --> 05:05.104
Number three
on our speed dial.

05:07.607 --> 05:09.609
Number three.

05:09.609 --> 05:10.610
Interesting.

05:16.115 --> 05:18.618
I can't believe
how calm you are.

05:18.618 --> 05:20.620
I'd be a nervous wreck by now.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.121
Well, I was nervous at first

05:22.121 --> 05:23.623
but every step I thought,

05:23.623 --> 05:25.591
"How would Frasier
and Niles do this?"

05:26.025 --> 05:27.860
And didn't do that.

05:28.061 --> 05:30.063
MRS. MOON:
Daphne, I'm home!

05:30.396 --> 05:32.365
Coming, Mom!

05:34.801 --> 05:36.235
Where's the video?

05:36.502 --> 05:38.037
I thought you were
going to rent Castaway.

05:38.504 --> 05:41.074
If I wanted to watch
someone talk to a volleyball

05:41.074 --> 05:43.576
for two hours, I would have
stayed in Manchester

05:44.077 --> 05:45.011
with your Aunt Evelyn.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.413
Well, what are
you going to do all night?

05:47.847 --> 05:49.916
Oh, you needn't worry
about me.

05:49.916 --> 05:51.417
I'm going to watch a boxing match

05:51.918 --> 05:52.852
on pay-per-view.

05:53.186 --> 05:56.255
There's nothing like
two, great, sweaty beasts

05:56.255 --> 05:59.258
beating each other senseless.

05:59.258 --> 06:00.760
I miss your father.

06:03.262 --> 06:04.263
Come on, Alice

06:04.263 --> 06:06.265
It's time to put
 away your crayons.

06:06.265 --> 06:07.266
Lookit.

06:07.266 --> 06:08.768
I wrote my name
really big.

06:08.768 --> 06:10.069
see.
Oh, let's

06:10.336 --> 06:14.273
There and there and there

06:14.540 --> 06:16.109
and there.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.110
(gasps)

06:17.110 --> 06:18.044
Oh, my God!

06:19.512 --> 06:20.480
Alice!

06:20.880 --> 06:22.949
Oh, Daphne, I'm so sorry

06:22.949 --> 06:24.417
Oh, it's not to worry.

06:24.951 --> 06:25.952
It'll come out.

06:25.952 --> 06:27.754
It's only
a little crayon.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.055
That's worse.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.290
I can handle this.

06:31.557 --> 06:34.127
Niles has an art restorer
he uses all the time.

06:34.127 --> 06:34.927
I'll get his card.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.163
I'm sorry, Mommy.

06:37.430 --> 06:38.464
I know, honey.

06:38.464 --> 06:39.966
But from now on,

06:39.966 --> 06:43.770
just only sign
your own artwork, okay?

06:43.970 --> 06:45.505
'Cause mine is prettier.

06:47.974 --> 06:49.809
Yeah.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.645
Here's his business card.

06:52.645 --> 06:54.647
Okay, I'll run it right over.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.482
Just tell him it's
an emergency.

06:56.482 --> 06:58.317
s.
We're very good customer

07:00.787 --> 07:02.789
I'm just glad Niles isn't here.

07:03.289 --> 07:06.292
He doesn't take these things in his stride like I do.

07:06.793 --> 07:08.661
There.

07:09.061 --> 07:10.630
Another fire put out.

07:14.667 --> 07:15.668
Oh, my God! The hens.

07:17.336 --> 07:19.906
Oh, my God!

07:19.906 --> 07:21.407
Okay, don't panic.

07:21.874 --> 07:23.910
I can handle this.

07:31.918 --> 07:33.419
Oh, look at that!

07:33.419 --> 07:35.888
Daphne, now what
are you going to do?

07:36.289 --> 07:37.857
Well, I can't call
the caterer.

07:37.857 --> 07:40.793
They were doing a big party
and we were their last stop.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.228
Oh, I know. Call Frasier.

07:42.228 --> 07:43.496
He's got to know some caterers

07:43.696 --> 07:45.765
Well, he was upset
that I took over his job

07:45.765 --> 07:49.268
as Lord Mayor of Party Town,
but he did offer his help.

07:49.268 --> 07:50.203
I hope he meant it.

07:50.703 --> 07:52.205
Go, take the painting.

07:52.205 --> 07:53.272
Yes. Come on, Alice.

07:53.706 --> 07:54.273
Good luck.

07:54.774 --> 07:55.775
Daphne, you're never going

07:55.775 --> 07:57.276
to get a caterer
at this late hour.

07:57.276 --> 07:58.277
But don't worry,

07:58.711 --> 08:01.247
I think I can solve
your little problem.

08:01.247 --> 08:02.281
I'll be right there.

08:02.715 --> 08:06.719
As usual, Frasier
has to save the day.

08:08.688 --> 08:11.257
As usual, Martin has
to hear about it.

08:13.000 --> 08:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:22.435 --> 08:25.404
Suit up, boys, we're going in.

08:34.981 --> 08:37.482
All right, I need a full
rundown of the situation.

08:37.482 --> 08:40.486
Well, I think I told
you about the hens
Mm-hmm.

08:40.986 --> 08:42.388
which I burned
Ooh.

08:42.755 --> 08:45.324
Um, I'm hoping we have enough ice, and...

08:45.324 --> 08:46.259
Mm-hmm.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.127
I probably shouldn't have dressed

08:48.127 --> 08:49.662
the salad
this afternoon

08:49.662 --> 08:51.964
Oh.

08:51.964 --> 08:53.299
But I'm pretty sure

08:53.299 --> 08:55.368
the soup is okay.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.836
(sniffing)

08:56.836 --> 08:58.704
White wine.

09:01.474 --> 09:03.776
What do you think?
Will we make it?

09:07.313 --> 09:10.316
I feel so stupid. I made a big
deal about telling Niles

09:10.316 --> 09:11.884
how I could handle this
on my own.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.719
All right, all right, listen.

09:13.986 --> 09:14.987
He doesn't have to know.

09:14.987 --> 09:17.056
If you just keep
him out of my way,

09:17.056 --> 09:19.825
I will gladly play
your invisible
little kitchen elf

09:20.092 --> 09:21.160
You would do that for me?

09:21.160 --> 09:22.128
Oh, of course, Daphne!

09:22.662 --> 09:24.664
Now, listen, I've brought
everything I need

09:24.664 --> 09:27.667
to make my signature
pomegranate-honey sauce,
all right?

09:27.667 --> 09:29.936
I will need a ramekin
for each of your guests.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.740
Here we are.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.242
Oh, dear,
this is bad.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.209
What?

09:37.610 --> 09:39.078
Well, there are two
that are mismatched.

09:39.445 --> 09:41.314
It's all right if they're
 all mismatched

09:41.514 --> 09:43.049
or... or even in pairs, but two?

09:43.049 --> 09:44.317
It's just unheard of.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.152
NILES:
Daphne?

09:46.152 --> 09:48.154
Oh, my God,
it's Niles.

09:48.154 --> 09:49.155
What should we do?

09:49.155 --> 09:50.656
Don't worry.
I'm right in here.

09:52.658 --> 09:54.160
Ah, sorry I'm late.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.661
You look beautiful.
Darling.

09:55.661 --> 09:59.231
I had the worst time finding
miniature easels for the table.

09:59.498 --> 10:00.533
Oh, but it was worth it.

10:00.533 --> 10:01.534
I think so.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.002
The place looks lovely,

10:03.002 --> 10:05.004
and the new chandelier
is absolutely spectacular.

10:05.004 --> 10:06.439
But why is the painting covered?

10:06.839 --> 10:07.907
Well, because I thought

10:08.374 --> 10:10.409
a proper unveiling
would be an event.

10:10.409 --> 10:12.211
We'll do it after dinner.

10:12.478 --> 10:14.046
Oh, oh, why don't we
do it after cocktails?

10:14.046 --> 10:15.548
It'll make for lively
dinner conversation.

10:15.982 --> 10:17.550
Trust me, after will be better

10:18.017 --> 10:21.587
And by the way, the kitchen is off-limits to you.

10:22.088 --> 10:24.090
You've already slowed me down

10:24.090 --> 10:26.025
(doorbell rings )

10:26.525 --> 10:28.527
Well, someone's tediously punctual. Shall we?

10:28.961 --> 10:30.029
I'll be right out.

10:30.029 --> 10:30.997
Okay.

10:34.533 --> 10:36.535
You know, if he had any resourcefulness at all

10:36.535 --> 10:38.537
he would know that tiny easels abound

10:38.537 --> 10:40.539
at Lilliputiana Dollhouse and Miniatures.

10:45.411 --> 10:47.413
Dad... right.

10:47.413 --> 10:50.416
Listen, I need you
to do me a favor.

10:52.451 --> 10:54.487
I want you to get me
my ramekins, all right,

10:54.487 --> 10:55.488
and then bring them here,

10:55.988 --> 10:57.857
but come in the back way,
so Niles doesn't see you

10:58.190 --> 10:59.759
No, ramekins.

10:59.759 --> 11:03.262
Well, they're small,
round, ceramic dishes.

11:03.262 --> 11:06.198
I keep them in the lower
left-hand kitchen cabinet.

11:06.565 --> 11:10.136
All right, no, no, no,
those are tapas dishes.

11:10.136 --> 11:12.138
Right, those are for soy sauce.

11:12.138 --> 11:13.639
Oh, honestly, Dad, you know

11:13.639 --> 11:15.641
sometimes I think
you listen to me.

11:15.641 --> 11:18.144
I-I said sometimes
I don't think you...

11:18.144 --> 11:21.614
No, I said sometimes I--
I see what you're doing.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.582
Are we the first
to arrive?

11:24.083 --> 11:26.419
Oh, you are
refreshingly on time.

11:26.719 --> 11:28.287
How about some drinks?

11:28.788 --> 11:29.789
Don't mind me.

11:29.789 --> 11:33.659
I'm just down
to nick a bottle of
the good stuff.

11:34.060 --> 11:37.129
They normally hide it from me.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.565
This is my mother,
Gertrude Moon.

11:39.965 --> 11:41.033
Yes, Antonia
and Alex.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.368
Hello.
Pleasure to meet you.

11:42.635 --> 11:46.172
Oh, Mum, as long as you're going upstairs, take the coats.

11:46.172 --> 11:47.973
Yes.
Is this the Mike Shaw painting?

11:47.973 --> 11:49.308
I'm dying to see it.

11:49.308 --> 11:50.876
Oh, oh, sorry.
No peeking.

11:50.876 --> 11:53.279
You'll have
to wait until
the unveiling.

11:53.579 --> 11:55.648
That sounds like a challenge.

11:55.648 --> 11:58.517
You're going to have
to watch me like a hawk.

11:58.818 --> 12:00.186
Won't that be fun?

12:00.453 --> 12:01.520
(loud clatter)

12:01.520 --> 12:02.955
What was that?

12:03.289 --> 12:05.357
Don't worry, Niles, that's my domain.

12:05.357 --> 12:07.126
All right.
Why don't you take

12:07.326 --> 12:09.361
our guest on a tour of the library?

12:09.795 --> 12:11.831
Oh, all right.
This way, this way.

12:11.831 --> 12:15.367
Is it true you still collect
Edwardian utility bills?

12:15.367 --> 12:16.869
Oh, yes. They're fascinating.

12:16.869 --> 12:18.337
For example,
did you know that

12:18.804 --> 12:21.373
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
was a notorious water hog?

12:21.841 --> 12:23.876
But you don't have
to take my word for it.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.146
Frasier!

12:27.146 --> 12:29.014
I dropped a pan;
everything's all right.

12:29.515 --> 12:30.015
MRS. MOON:
Daphne!

12:30.449 --> 12:32.017
For God's sakes, all right!

12:34.019 --> 12:37.523
I'm having trouble
ordering the boxing match.

12:37.957 --> 12:39.024
I don't understand.

12:39.024 --> 12:42.027
This never happens
with the nudie programming.

12:42.027 --> 12:44.029
Give it here.

12:44.029 --> 12:45.531
(doorbell rings)
Oh, damn.

12:45.531 --> 12:48.801
You answer that,
I'll take care of this.

12:48.801 --> 12:50.603
You can come out now.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.038
Honestly, Daphne, if these interruptions don't stop,

12:53.539 --> 12:56.108
my signature sauce will
be reduced to a monogram.

12:56.108 --> 12:57.076
(chuckling)

12:57.476 --> 12:59.545
I'm using humor
to make a point, hmm?

13:01.313 --> 13:03.382
Hello. I'm Daphe's Mum.

13:03.382 --> 13:04.650
I'm Bill...
Don't bother.

13:04.850 --> 13:06.819
I'm just letting you in.

13:07.153 --> 13:08.721
Hi. Is this the Crane place?

13:08.721 --> 13:10.222
I'm Mike Shaw.

13:10.723 --> 13:13.225
Mr. Shaw, we thought we were just going
to see your painting.

13:13.225 --> 13:15.227
We didn't realize you were coming.

13:15.227 --> 13:16.729
That was a last-minute thing.

13:16.729 --> 13:17.730
Uh, call me Mike.

13:17.730 --> 13:19.231
Mike.

13:19.732 --> 13:20.633
Hello.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.501
I'm Gertrude.

13:22.902 --> 13:23.903
rino
I'm Bill Talla

13:23.903 --> 13:27.740
and this is my wife, Sharon Kwiatkowski-Tallarino.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.041
May I just say that

13:29.041 --> 13:32.912
you are our greatest living
American artist, bar none.

13:33.345 --> 13:33.913
Barnone.

13:34.413 --> 13:35.881
(cell phone rings)
Excuse me.

13:36.315 --> 13:39.385
Is there anything worse
than making phony conversation

13:39.385 --> 13:40.386
with phony art lovers?

13:40.886 --> 13:43.389
Yes. Living with one.

13:43.389 --> 13:44.890
My son-in-law is the host.

13:44.890 --> 13:48.394
And if you didn't want your bu
kissed, you shouldn't have come.

13:48.894 --> 13:50.162
That's all they do here.

13:50.162 --> 13:52.698
I wasn't going to come,
but my gallery insisted.

13:52.698 --> 13:55.935
Oh, well, I am going to go
upstairs watching a boxing match

13:55.935 --> 13:58.304
should you feel the need
to get away.

13:58.537 --> 14:01.440
Well, I probably shouldn't
but maybe just the first round.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.409
All right, then.

14:03.409 --> 14:05.911
You wouldn't have
anything to drink
up there, would you?

14:06.412 --> 14:06.912
Just liquor.

14:09.915 --> 14:12.418
So, it actually took
George Bernard Shaw longer

14:12.418 --> 14:13.919
to rectify his billing error

14:13.919 --> 14:15.921
than it did for him
to writeMan and Superman

14:16.422 --> 14:18.958
That's Great.
Are those the drinks?

14:18.958 --> 14:20.459
Yes.
(doorbell rings)

14:20.459 --> 14:21.460
Oh, excuse me.

14:21.460 --> 14:22.461
Bill and Sharon.

14:25.464 --> 14:26.966
Thad and Jeremy, welcome.

14:27.466 --> 14:28.801
Niles!
Niles.

14:29.068 --> 14:30.002
Hey.
Hi!

14:30.302 --> 14:31.303
Where's your better half?

14:31.737 --> 14:32.771
NILES:
Oh, ah,
here she is now.

14:33.239 --> 14:34.807
Oh, I meant Frasier.

14:34.807 --> 14:38.310
My brother's not
coming this evening.

14:38.744 --> 14:41.313
But he's always, always,
always at your parties:

14:41.313 --> 14:43.315
Frasier and yellowtail
carpaccio.

14:43.315 --> 14:44.750
Has the world gone mad?

14:45.117 --> 14:47.519
Not yet. We still
have carpaccio.
(chuckles)

14:49.355 --> 14:51.323
You've got two choices.

14:51.323 --> 14:53.826
You can walk either walk away
from the painting,

14:54.326 --> 14:56.195
or you can limp away
from the painting.

14:56.462 --> 14:58.030
Walk.

14:58.030 --> 15:01.333
Mother, coats.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.168
Yes, Master.

15:05.838 --> 15:08.407
Niles, we are so sorry, we have to go;
we have a baby-sitter.

15:08.407 --> 15:09.909
No, that's terrible.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.845
The worst part is, we're going to miss dinner with Mike Shaw.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.914
I can't believe you got
that old hermit to come.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.181
Mike, Mike Shaw is here?
What?!

15:16.515 --> 15:18.083
Where is he?
He must have wandered off.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.585
He's not at all
like I pictured him--

15:19.585 --> 15:21.020
older guy, white hair, cane.

15:21.020 --> 15:22.588
I think he's wearing
a plaid flannel shirt.

15:23.088 --> 15:23.856
He's quite a character.

15:24.089 --> 15:25.157
Really?

15:25.658 --> 15:26.659
(all talking at once)

15:30.396 --> 15:31.397
Here you go.

15:31.397 --> 15:32.731
Oh, Dad, finally.

15:32.998 --> 15:34.066
If you had said nut bowls,

15:34.566 --> 15:36.068
I would have gotten
them right off.

15:36.468 --> 15:38.037
Yes, yes, all right.
Now, listen.

15:38.037 --> 15:40.539
I need you to run to
the grocery store for me

15:40.539 --> 15:43.342
and pick up somesel de mer,
some olive tapenade,

15:43.542 --> 15:46.045
balsamic vinegar and some
English Stilton cheese.

15:46.612 --> 15:47.446
Have you got that?

15:47.446 --> 15:49.848
You lost me
after Sally's mare.

15:49.848 --> 15:50.816
All right, fine.

15:50.816 --> 15:52.251
I'll write it down

15:52.251 --> 15:53.285
NILES:
Coming right up.

15:53.285 --> 15:54.286
DAPHNE:
Niles, no.

15:54.286 --> 15:55.788
Oh, Dad, hide in there!

15:57.790 --> 15:58.791
Oh, Dad!
Oh, I thought so.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.292
What are you doing here?

16:00.793 --> 16:02.294
I just brought
some dishes over.

16:02.294 --> 16:03.662
Wh...?

16:03.963 --> 16:06.031
You're not supposed
to be in the kitchen, honey.

16:06.031 --> 16:07.032
I don't
know what happened

16:07.032 --> 16:08.534
and I don't want to know how it happened

16:09.034 --> 16:10.035
but somehow, our
guests are all

16:10.035 --> 16:11.904
under the impression
that Dad is Mike Shaw.

16:12.338 --> 16:13.405
Who?

16:13.839 --> 16:15.407
He's the artist-- the painter of the painting

16:15.407 --> 16:16.408
that everyone
is here to see

16:16.408 --> 16:17.910
What are we going to do?

16:17.910 --> 16:18.877
It's not a problem.

16:19.345 --> 16:21.413
We'll take your father
out the back door

16:21.413 --> 16:22.414
and make up an excuse.

16:24.917 --> 16:26.919
Better yet, we'll take him out the front door.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.420
That way, people
can see him leave.

16:28.420 --> 16:29.355
Uh, okay.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.290
You know zero about art;
don't say a word

16:31.290 --> 16:33.258
or these people will see
right through you.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.228
Yeah, I'm sure a phony
will really stand out
at this party.

16:39.098 --> 16:40.666
Oh, this must be
Mr. Shaw.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.067
NILES:
I have very
bad news.

16:42.434 --> 16:44.436
Mr. Shaw is not
feeling well,

16:44.436 --> 16:45.504
so he has to leave.

16:45.938 --> 16:46.939
Oh, oh, I can't...

16:46.939 --> 16:50.009
I can't let you go without
getting your autograph.

16:50.009 --> 16:53.012
And if you could draw
something on it.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.014
Well, actually I do a pretty good rocket.

16:55.014 --> 16:58.417
No, no, Antonia,
Mr. Shaw's not
giving away art.

16:58.717 --> 17:00.152
Just write Mike Shaw.

17:00.419 --> 17:01.487
Now, isn't that nice.

17:01.487 --> 17:02.955
Okay, and there you go.
That's for you.

17:02.955 --> 17:03.956
Come along,
come along.

17:03.956 --> 17:05.457
Please, just say
a few words about

17:05.457 --> 17:06.959
The Dry Wit
of the Sandwich Maker.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.965
Who wants another tour?
Oh, I do.

17:14.233 --> 17:16.135
Get out.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.103
Niles, why don't
we show them the
secret passageway.

17:18.604 --> 17:19.104
Oh, what
a good idea.

17:19.605 --> 17:20.305
(doorbell ringing)

17:20.571 --> 17:21.640
I'll catch up with you.

17:21.640 --> 17:23.041
Don't let them in
the panic room.

17:26.310 --> 17:27.813
Oh, hello.

17:27.813 --> 17:29.815
I'd almost given up on you.

17:29.815 --> 17:30.816
Oh, it's lovely.

17:30.816 --> 17:31.817
Thanks.

17:31.817 --> 17:32.818
And if you don't mind,

17:33.318 --> 17:34.319
I find it's best to get paid

17:34.319 --> 17:35.320
while there's still evidence.

17:35.821 --> 17:36.822
Yes, of course, of course.

17:36.822 --> 17:38.824
I'll tell you what,
if you'll just wheel it

17:38.824 --> 17:39.825
over there by the
dining rotunda

17:39.825 --> 17:40.759
I'll be right with you.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.661
The coast is clear.

17:42.661 --> 17:45.664
Come on, let's get
a bottle of champagne

17:45.664 --> 17:47.166
and go back up.

17:47.166 --> 17:49.601
Hey, you're Mike Shaw.

17:49.935 --> 17:51.470
I studied you in art school.

17:51.470 --> 17:52.838
You're a major influence

17:53.105 --> 17:54.673
That's very flattering.

17:54.673 --> 17:58.677
Now, shall we get back
upstairs for round three?

17:58.677 --> 18:01.080
Uh, she's talking
about the fight.

18:01.447 --> 18:03.449
Of course, the night's
still young.

18:06.885 --> 18:09.855
And here... and that...
and here you go...

18:09.855 --> 18:10.856
and... thank you.

18:11.390 --> 18:12.391
No, no, thank you.

18:12.391 --> 18:14.893
I just met one
of my heroes--
Mike Shaw.

18:14.893 --> 18:16.395
Oh, yes, in the hall?

18:16.795 --> 18:17.763
No, right here.

18:18.130 --> 18:19.198
Don't tell me--

18:19.198 --> 18:22.000
white hair, cane,
plaid shirt, character.

18:23.435 --> 18:25.003
I forgot the list.

18:25.003 --> 18:26.004
NILES:
Mr. Shaw.

18:26.004 --> 18:29.007
Oh, for God's sake

18:29.007 --> 18:32.010
Dad, you're not
supposed to be here.

18:32.010 --> 18:35.013
Niles, you're not
supposed to be here.

18:35.013 --> 18:37.516
And what's in here?

18:38.016 --> 18:40.519
Oh, Mr. Shaw, you came back.

18:40.519 --> 18:41.954
I, uh... felt better.

18:42.354 --> 18:43.922
Then you must talk to us
about your work.

18:43.922 --> 18:45.424
We're collectors,
you know.

18:45.424 --> 18:46.325
Oh, but this
is a party.

18:46.325 --> 18:48.060
I, uh... I...

18:48.060 --> 18:50.696
art all the time.

18:50.696 --> 18:51.930
MAN:
Come on.

18:51.930 --> 18:54.900
Let's get you
another drink.

18:54.900 --> 18:55.734
Fun party.

18:56.034 --> 18:57.069
It's nice to see you step out

18:57.603 --> 18:58.570
of Frasier's shadow.

18:58.570 --> 19:00.572
I think he might have been
holding you back.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.040
Okay, I have to get out there

19:02.040 --> 19:03.542
before Dad says
something stupid.

19:03.542 --> 19:04.543
Let's get these hens browning

19:05.043 --> 19:06.545
so we can eat as soon as
possible...

19:06.545 --> 19:07.546
Mm...

19:07.546 --> 19:08.947
that's Frasier's signature sauce.

19:09.248 --> 19:10.816
Except it's
so much better.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.752
I think you should
send him the recipe.

19:28.333 --> 19:31.303
I'm holding him back.

19:31.303 --> 19:35.807
Your sauce is
better than mine.

19:35.807 --> 19:39.311
Honestly, I don't even
know why I try.

19:39.311 --> 19:42.314
I stand here slaving over
a hot stove, and for what?

19:42.714 --> 19:44.283
Does anybody
appreciate me?

19:44.283 --> 19:46.618
No.

19:46.952 --> 19:50.022
Are you getting close,
Mr. Slovadkin?

19:50.022 --> 19:52.824
These things
take time, Miss.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.261
Who do you think I am,

19:56.261 --> 19:59.264
that mouse in the cartoons
that goes fast?

19:59.765 --> 20:00.666
What's his name?

20:01.033 --> 20:02.100
Speedy Gonzalez.

20:02.601 --> 20:04.469
No.

20:04.770 --> 20:07.339
The little mouse,
with a big hat

20:07.339 --> 20:10.242
and he goes very fast.

20:10.609 --> 20:12.477
That's Speedy Gonzalez.

20:12.778 --> 20:13.845
No. The mouse...

20:13.845 --> 20:14.846
(phone ringing)

20:14.846 --> 20:16.248
This is going to drive
me crazy.

20:16.548 --> 20:19.117
Hello.

20:19.117 --> 20:20.619
I have no idea.

20:20.619 --> 20:24.623
Can't you just stall
dinner for a little while?

20:24.623 --> 20:26.625
All right, don't yell.

20:26.625 --> 20:28.894
My friend wants
to talk to you,
Mr. Slovadkin.

20:29.094 --> 20:31.163
Oh, it's very small.

20:33.165 --> 20:35.167
Hello.

20:35.667 --> 20:38.170
.
I'm going as fast as I can

20:38.170 --> 20:43.175
I'm not that little mouse that goes zip all around.

20:43.675 --> 20:45.177
What's his name?

20:45.177 --> 20:47.613
No. That's what she said

20:49.514 --> 20:52.918
He's a mouse.

20:52.918 --> 20:55.087
What impresses
me the most

20:55.320 --> 20:57.389
is the way you
reinvent identity

20:57.389 --> 20:58.857
while recording
anonymity.

20:59.291 --> 21:01.860
Well, that took
years to get down.

21:01.860 --> 21:02.861
Sure, sure.

21:02.861 --> 21:04.696
Come on,
tell us,

21:04.963 --> 21:06.965
what do you think of Warhol?

21:07.332 --> 21:09.901
Crap.

21:11.637 --> 21:12.537
Kienholz?

21:12.804 --> 21:13.872
Crap.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.340
It is so refreshing

21:15.841 --> 21:18.110
to have someone
speak so candidly.

21:18.310 --> 21:21.847
And you have to believe me
'cause I'm a fancy-ass artist.

21:22.214 --> 21:23.682
(laughing)

21:25.617 --> 21:27.452
MAN:
Oh, hey, I know--

21:27.686 --> 21:29.254
why don't you take us
through the house

21:29.254 --> 21:31.256
and tell us what you
think of Niles's art.

21:31.256 --> 21:33.258
Oh, yes,
please.

21:33.258 --> 21:34.760
Sure.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.229
I've been waiting
to do that

21:37.229 --> 21:38.530
for a long time.

21:38.730 --> 21:40.232
You can't brown
the hens yet.

21:40.232 --> 21:43.302
If we wait any longer,
their skins will wrinkle

21:43.302 --> 21:44.803
and my sauce
will separate.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.305
Is that what
you want?

21:46.305 --> 21:47.306
I...

21:47.306 --> 21:50.309
Is that what
you want?!

21:50.809 --> 21:52.311
NILES:
Daphne.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.312
Damn it.

21:55.247 --> 21:57.316
You're not supposed to be in here!

22:00.886 --> 22:01.386
I'm sorry.

22:01.887 --> 22:02.888
Dad's run amok.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.389
Why aren't the hens browning?

22:04.890 --> 22:05.891
Because they're
not ready yet.

22:05.891 --> 22:06.892
But they look ready.

22:07.392 --> 22:08.393
Yes, well, they're not.

22:08.393 --> 22:09.895
Then we'll just
serve them as is.

22:09.895 --> 22:11.396
You can't,
they're not browned.

22:11.396 --> 22:12.397
.
We're going to

22:12.397 --> 22:13.732
I'm going to get a platter.

22:14.032 --> 22:15.567
Don't open
that door.

22:17.269 --> 22:18.337
Stop that.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.338
I already saw him.

22:19.738 --> 22:21.306
What are you
doing here?

22:21.306 --> 22:22.796
I am saving your party,

22:23.342 --> 22:24.409
that's what I'm doing.

22:24.409 --> 22:25.410
Niles...

22:25.410 --> 22:26.411
You don't have
to explain.

22:26.411 --> 22:27.913
Frasier's presence here

22:27.913 --> 22:29.715
is clearly why this
party's gone awry.

22:29.948 --> 22:31.016
Oh, really?

22:31.016 --> 22:32.951
Well, if that's
what you think,

22:32.951 --> 22:36.021
then I will gladly take my
signature sauce and go.

22:36.421 --> 22:36.888
Your signature sauce?

22:37.255 --> 22:38.323
And that reminds me,

22:38.323 --> 22:39.825
you won't be needing to use my poultry shears.

22:39.825 --> 22:40.826
No, no, no,
you can't.

22:40.826 --> 22:41.827
It's already here.

22:41.827 --> 22:42.828
This is mine.

22:43.228 --> 22:45.163
No, it-it's
on my property.

22:45.564 --> 22:47.132
Oh, stop it!
Stop it, both of you!

22:47.132 --> 22:48.467
Fine!

22:50.135 --> 22:52.504
(all gasping)

22:52.504 --> 22:54.940
What have you done?!

22:54.940 --> 22:56.441
I'm not sorry.

22:56.441 --> 22:59.311
You've been asking
for this for years.

23:01.246 --> 23:03.315
No, it's not
what you think.

23:03.315 --> 23:04.812
See, yummy.

23:05.484 --> 23:06.551
(gasping)

23:06.985 --> 23:07.486
No, no, it's sauce.

23:07.986 --> 23:09.488
We just had a little
kitchen mishap.

23:09.488 --> 23:10.489
We'll just get
this cleaned up.

23:10.989 --> 23:11.990
Wipe yourself
off with this.

23:11.990 --> 23:12.924
Thanks, Dad.

23:13.258 --> 23:16.828
That is no Mike Shaw.

23:17.262 --> 23:18.630
What happened
to my painting?

23:18.897 --> 23:20.298
Did you know
about this, Mike?

23:20.565 --> 23:23.502
I may have.

23:23.835 --> 23:25.904
Oh, give it
up, Martin.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.406
This isn't Mike Shaw.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.407
.
It's Niles's father

23:28.840 --> 23:30.742
What are you trying
to pull, Crane?

23:32.511 --> 23:33.578
This is uncomfortable.

23:33.578 --> 23:34.546
We should go.

23:34.980 --> 23:37.883
DAPHNE:
No, no, no, please,
listen to me. Listen.

23:37.883 --> 23:39.684
Yes, there's been
some deception

23:40.185 --> 23:41.686
and things got out of hand,

23:41.686 --> 23:43.688
but no real harm has been done.

23:43.688 --> 23:45.190
I've made some mistakes.

23:45.690 --> 23:46.691
People make mistakes.

23:46.691 --> 23:49.528
But that's no reason
to abandon them.

23:49.528 --> 23:51.797
This night can still
be a success.

23:51.797 --> 23:54.566
We've got the food,
and you're all here,

23:54.566 --> 23:57.369
and when I tell you about
what happened,

23:57.369 --> 23:59.871
we'll all have a good laugh about it.

23:59.871 --> 24:01.373
So, please, everybody stay?

24:02.874 --> 24:04.376
(all agreeing)

24:04.376 --> 24:05.177
Oh, thank you.

24:05.177 --> 24:07.012
Well done, Daphne.

24:07.012 --> 24:08.880
(loud creaking)

24:12.717 --> 24:14.653
(creaking continues)

24:33.672 --> 24:35.140
Hello.

24:43.482 --> 24:47.886
All right, get your coats.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.828
Daphne...

24:56.828 --> 24:59.331
congratulations.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.833
You're now
officially a Crane.
