Hello, this is Alpha and Beta.
Over.

00:47.298 --> 00:50.260
MAN (on radio):
<i>We read you, Alpha Beta. Location. Over.</i>

00:50.343 --> 00:51.886
We're whipping along South Factory

00:51.970 --> 00:56.641
and should be coming into the old "minterooni"
in about nine minutes at 1100.

00:56.725 --> 00:58.143
Over and out.

01:17.662 --> 01:19.289
DRIVER: What's goin' on?

01:19.372 --> 01:22.083
Wait a minute.
Oh, Christ! Arabs!

01:22.167 --> 01:24.502
- What are you talking about?
- For Christ's sake!

01:26.379 --> 01:30.008
Base, this is Alpha Beta.
Come in. Come in, base.

01:30.091 --> 01:32.635
DRIVER: I bet it's Arabs.
I saw a TV show. This is what they do.

01:32.719 --> 01:34.804
Base, come in. Come in, base.
This is Alpha Beta.

01:34.888 --> 01:37.724
- Oh, Jesus Maria.
- This is Alpha Beta! Come in!

01:37.807 --> 01:41.060
- DRIVER: Goddamned Arabs!
- They're lowering us now.

01:41.144 --> 01:43.521
- What's happenin'? What's wrong?
- I think we're jammed.

01:43.605 --> 01:46.274
Jammed? Get somebody on that radio!
We can't use no jammed!

01:46.357 --> 01:47.525
Hello! Base! Base!

01:47.609 --> 01:50.320
DRIVER: We're the US Treasury,

This ain't no Wells Fargo truck!

01:59.412 --> 02:01.498

Yeah, I'll get your ass! I'll get ya!

02:11.716 --> 02:13.384
Get outta there!

02:57.470 --> 03:00.098
Look at this shit.
There's nothin' but money in here.

03:09.607 --> 03:11.442
That's the ticket. Let's go.

05:19.404 --> 05:21.072
Vince?

05:22.740 --> 05:24.158
Hey, Vince.

05:30.248 --> 05:31.708
Hey.

05:32.875 --> 05:34.377
Hey.

05:36.379 --> 05:39.090
- Hey, Vince.
- Gee, I can't believe this trade.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.843
What the hell do the Mets
need another pitcher for?

05:41.926 --> 05:43.344
All they got is pitchers.

05:43.428 --> 05:46.222
What are we doin' up here?
I don't understand.

05:46.305 --> 05:47.890
Oh, there's reasons.

05:47.974 --> 05:50.601
I mean, you know,
I don't just do things.

05:50.685 --> 05:52.520
There's always a valid reason.

05:52.603 --> 05:54.147
Let me see.

05:58.401 --> 06:00.194
Mm-hmm.

06:00.278 --> 06:02.530
- All right. Any problems?
- None.

06:02.613 --> 06:05.241
Fabulous. Fabulous work.

06:05.324 --> 06:07.910
Now, what's the story on this?
You gonna bill me or what?

06:07.994 --> 06:10.246
- He wants a million-five for this.
- No sweat.

06:10.329 --> 06:12.707
- By tomorrow.
- What?

06:12.790 --> 06:14.208
Sorry. That's what he said.

06:14.292 --> 06:17.045
No, that's completely nuts.

06:17.128 --> 06:21.215
My kid is getting married Sunday. How does he
expect me to come up with that kind of money?

06:21.299 --> 06:22.425
Vince.

06:22.508 --> 06:25.053
Do you know how completely tied up
I've been with this deal?

06:25.136 --> 06:27.263
I haven't even met the bride's family yet.

06:27.346 --> 06:31.100
If it was up to me, you could take two weeks.
But that's what he told me.

06:32.143 --> 06:34.103
Jesus Christ.

06:36.064 --> 06:39.233
Okay. I just have to work
something out, that's all.

06:39.317 --> 06:40.818
Thanks for everything.

06:40.902 --> 06:42.653
- How's the wife?
- She's fine.

06:42.737 --> 06:44.739
You know she's taken up tennis?

06:44.822 --> 06:46.074
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

06:46.157 --> 06:48.534
That's one game,
I could never get the hang of it.

06:48.618 --> 06:52.455
I don't know what it is. Maybe it's because
you have to wear short pants to play.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.874
- (laughing)
- (sirens wailing)

06:57.001 --> 06:59.629
I guess we oughta
break this thing up, huh?

06:59.712 --> 07:02.048
- Take it easy.
- You too, Vince.

07:02.131 --> 07:03.549
So long.

07:03.633 --> 07:05.968
(sirens continue wailing)

07:17.980 --> 07:22.068
MAN: Evita, give Acme a call. I'm not happy
with the viscosity on these bibs.

07:23.361 --> 07:25.780
Okay, here we go, Mr. Hirschorn.

07:25.863 --> 07:27.532
Just open your mouth, please.

07:29.200 --> 07:33.788
Mr. Hirschorn, take your hand down,
put your head back, open your mouth.

07:33.871 --> 07:35.123
That's it.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.751
Mr. Hirschorn, I cannot work this way.

07:38.835 --> 07:42.880
Doc, 72 years I have this tooth.
He don't want to die.

07:42.964 --> 07:44.882
Mr. Hirschorn, your tooth is not a "he."

07:44.966 --> 07:47.844
It's nerves, enamel, rotten,
and it's gotta go. No big deal.

07:47.927 --> 07:50.638
Seventy-two years.
This tooth had steaks.

07:50.721 --> 07:52.890
This tooth had just beans
when I was poor.

07:52.974 --> 07:54.142
Mr. Hirschorn ‒

07:54.225 --> 07:56.477
This tooth chewed on beautiful women,

07:56.561 --> 07:58.479
including a second cousin
of Sophie Tucker.

07:58.563 --> 08:00.481
- Your tooth has had a wonderful ‒
- Dr. Kornpett?

08:00.565 --> 08:02.150
- Yeah.
- Your wife is on the line.

08:02.233 --> 08:03.985
- Tell her I'll be right there.
- Okay.

08:04.068 --> 08:07.196
Your tooth has had a wonderful life,
but now it's time to say good-bye.

08:07.280 --> 08:11.075
I understand. But I want you to know
what kind of a tooth this was.

08:11.159 --> 08:14.328
It's an extraordinary tooth.
It's gonna be an honor for me to pull it out.

08:14.412 --> 08:17.540
Which I'm gonna do right after
I answer this phone call. Excuse me.

08:18.249 --> 08:20.835
Hi. How's it going?

08:20.918 --> 08:22.461
The tent up?

08:22.545 --> 08:24.005
Terrific.

08:24.088 --> 08:26.883
Yeah, I'm getting excited.
Is Barbara home?

08:26.966 --> 08:28.718
Yes, she's here being very domestic.

08:28.801 --> 08:30.761
- Hi!
- She says hi.

08:30.845 --> 08:34.015
- And remember the wine.
- Oh, and remember the wine.

08:34.097 --> 08:35.683
No, not Beaujolais.

08:35.765 --> 08:39.395
Get something fancier.
Uh, a Saint-Émilion or a good California.

08:39.477 --> 08:40.897
Cabernet's great.

08:40.980 --> 08:43.691
Julia Child says Cabernet's great.

08:43.774 --> 08:46.194
- Will you be home early tonight?
- Yeah, 7:00 sharp.

08:46.277 --> 08:47.904
He's definitely coming over?

08:48.821 --> 08:51.407
Sweetheart,
I'll believe it when I see him.

08:51.490 --> 08:53.367
No, I'll behave myself.

08:53.451 --> 08:55.745
I got somebody in the chair,
so I gotta go.

08:55.828 --> 08:57.455
(kisses)
Me too. Good-bye.

08:58.122 --> 09:00.374
My daughter's getting married
on Sunday, Mr. Hirschorn.

09:00.458 --> 09:01.792
- Oh, no kiddin'.
- Yeah.

09:01.876 --> 09:03.920
- That's great, Doc. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

09:04.003 --> 09:05.630
Mazel tov. Nice boy?

09:05.713 --> 09:07.798
Oh, yeah.
Second-year law student at Yale.

09:07.882 --> 09:09.884
Oh. And the parents?

09:10.718 --> 09:12.136
Well, the mother's very nice.

09:12.220 --> 09:14.180
The father does some kind
of international consulting work.

09:14.263 --> 09:17.600
He travels a lot, so we haven't seen him.
He's coming to dinner tonight. First time.

09:18.768 --> 09:20.436
- Call it off.
- Call what off?

09:20.519 --> 09:22.563
The wedding.
Call it off until you know the father.

09:22.647 --> 09:24.649
- Well, it's Sunday ‒
- Call it off.

09:24.732 --> 09:26.734
She's marrying the son, not the father.

09:26.817 --> 09:30.071
The son is the acorn.
You gotta look at the tree.

09:30.154 --> 09:32.823
I've been around a little.
Give a listen.

09:32.907 --> 09:36.160
Uh, by the way, here.

09:36.911 --> 09:38.329
What's that, your tooth?

09:38.412 --> 09:41.707
- I pulled it when you were on the phone.
- (laughing)

09:41.791 --> 09:45.086
You're a nice boy.
You could hurt yourself pulling like that.

09:45.169 --> 09:48.339
- Now do me a favor.
- I can't call it off, Mr. Hirschorn.

09:48.422 --> 09:51.676
It's not 19th-century Minsk.
It's 20th-century Manhattan.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.094
- I hope I'm wrong.
- You're wrong.

09:53.177 --> 09:54.845
- Best of luck to you.
- Thank you.

09:54.929 --> 09:57.765
- (chuckles) Forget I said anything.
- I forgot already.

10:03.521 --> 10:06.440
(vehicle approaching)

10:06.524 --> 10:09.151
(vehicle passes)

10:11.070 --> 10:14.448
- False alarm.
- I hope they haven't had an accident.

10:14.532 --> 10:16.909
Mr. Ricardo's been out of town.
Maybe he got hung up.

10:16.993 --> 10:18.244
"Hung up"?

10:18.327 --> 10:21.872
- I have to take the roast beef out of the oven.
- Just put it on the warmer.

10:21.956 --> 10:25.334
- An hour late. Great start.
- I'm sure there's a good reason.

10:25.418 --> 10:28.504
- Why couldn't he call?
- Well, if he's in bad traffic, he can't call.

10:28.587 --> 10:31.507
- What are you taking their side for?
- I'm not taking anybody's side.

10:31.590 --> 10:35.219
- You're still in our family, Barbara.
- Oh, God, Dad, don't lay this on me.

10:35.303 --> 10:37.847
They're late, all right?
Don't make it like a family issue.

10:37.930 --> 10:40.516
Such a hotshot, how come
he doesn't have a phone in the car?

10:40.599 --> 10:42.351
Who said he was a hotshot?

10:42.435 --> 10:45.646
You did. Travels all over the world.
Hasn't got time to meet the new in-laws.

10:45.730 --> 10:48.983
I had a patient today, Mr. Hirschorn,
said I should call the whole thing off. Yes.

10:49.066 --> 10:52.153
- That's a brilliant solution to the problem.
- (vehicle approaching)

10:53.195 --> 10:54.613
Coupe de Ville?

10:54.697 --> 10:57.700
That's them. Are you okay, or are you
gonna be totally hostile to them?

10:57.783 --> 10:59.285
I'm fine. I'm fine.

11:02.246 --> 11:04.373
(doorbell rings)

11:05.583 --> 11:07.084
Will you ever forgive me?

11:07.168 --> 11:09.337
- Please come in. Come in.
- Oh, welcome!

11:09.420 --> 11:10.838
It's all my fault.

11:10.921 --> 11:14.342
I had business in Canada and those
damn Canadians, they never stop talking.

11:14.425 --> 11:18.012
- Believe me, I know what it's like.
- You must be the lovely mother of the bride.

11:18.095 --> 11:19.347
- Aww.
- I am ‒ Oh!

11:19.430 --> 11:21.515
Now I know where Barbara
gets her good looks.

11:21.599 --> 11:23.684
- Oh, thank you.
- We're just very, very glad you're here.

11:23.768 --> 11:27.063
- I'm Sheldon Kornpett.
- Shelly, I'm just thrilled to meet ya.

11:27.146 --> 11:30.900
Tommy tells me you were the first dentist
ever to use that drill that spritzes water?

11:30.983 --> 11:34.028
Among the first in New York, I think.
Why are we standing in the hallway?

11:34.111 --> 11:37.782
- Please come in and have a drink.
- I could use one. It's been one of those days.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.784
Shelly, have you ever had
one of those days ‒

11:39.867 --> 11:42.787
I hate to say this,
but if we don't sit down right away,

11:42.870 --> 11:44.789
that roast beef
is just going to be inedible.

11:44.872 --> 11:49.043
- I'm starving, so it's fine with me.
- I'll take drink orders and make them myself.

11:50.795 --> 11:52.046
I'm petrified.

11:52.129 --> 11:55.299
My father was like a maniac
before you came.

11:55.383 --> 11:56.926
(clears throat, sighs)

11:57.009 --> 11:59.595
Vince, how long did you
actually live in Guatemala?

11:59.678 --> 12:01.639
Oh, he was gone for ages.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.224
I was in the jungle ‒

12:03.307 --> 12:04.850
the bush, we called it ‒

12:04.934 --> 12:07.228
for approximately nine months.

12:07.311 --> 12:11.065
Nine months. My God.
That really must have been something.

12:11.148 --> 12:13.025
Sheldon, it was unbelievable.

12:13.109 --> 12:15.152
I saw things...

12:15.236 --> 12:18.239
They have tsetse flies down there
the size of eagles.

12:18.322 --> 12:19.907
Really.

12:19.990 --> 12:24.120
In the evening, I would stand in front
of my hut and watch in horror

12:24.829 --> 12:29.125
as these giant flies would pick children
off the ground and carry them away.

12:30.042 --> 12:32.461
- My God.
- Oh, the things he told us.

12:32.545 --> 12:35.256
- (clicks tongue)
- Oh, it was an incredible sight.

12:35.339 --> 12:40.302
Peasants screaming, chasing these flies
down the road, waving brooms.

12:40.386 --> 12:42.471
You can imagine the pathetic quality

12:42.555 --> 12:47.685
of this waving these crudely fashioned
brooms at these enormous flies

12:47.768 --> 12:50.771
as they carried their children
off to almost certain death.

12:50.855 --> 12:53.149
Oh, that is just
the most horrible thing.

12:53.983 --> 12:56.026
You sure these are flies
you're talking about?

12:56.694 --> 12:58.195
Flies.

12:59.363 --> 13:01.782
The natives had a name for 'em.

13:01.866 --> 13:05.369
<i>- José Grecos de Muertos.</i>
- (Mrs. Kornpett gasps)

13:05.453 --> 13:07.288
Flamenco dancers of death.

13:07.371 --> 13:10.624
You took those slides of them
that never came out, remember?

13:10.708 --> 13:13.335
That's a shame. I really would have liked
to have seen those slides.

13:13.419 --> 13:14.545
- Me too.
- Yeah.

13:14.628 --> 13:16.547
I left 'em in a jacket
that got Martinized.

13:16.630 --> 13:20.718
It broke my heart because those slides
would've won me a Pulitzer Prize.

13:21.385 --> 13:25.806
The enormous flies
flapping slowly away into the sunset.

13:26.640 --> 13:29.143
Small, brown babies
clutched in their beaks.

13:29.226 --> 13:30.728
Wow.

13:31.479 --> 13:33.564
Beaks? Flies with beaks?

13:33.647 --> 13:35.608
A sight I'll never forget.

13:35.691 --> 13:37.818
I was stunned. Appalled.

13:37.902 --> 13:39.570
What did you do?

13:41.071 --> 13:42.323
What did I do?

13:42.406 --> 13:44.867
As a consultant,
what did you do about the flies?

13:45.784 --> 13:47.786
Sadly, there's very little you can do

13:47.870 --> 13:50.247
because of the tremendous
red tape in the bush.

13:50.331 --> 13:52.082
There's red tape in the bush?

13:52.917 --> 13:55.294
Enormous red tape, Sheldon.

13:55.377 --> 13:59.089
These flies, for example, uh,
they're protected against pilferage

13:59.173 --> 14:03.010
under the provisions
of the Guacamole Act of 1917.

14:05.262 --> 14:07.932
I've been getting the <i>National Geographic</i>
for years. I never ran into any ‒

14:08.015 --> 14:10.684
- Dad, could I have some more wine?
- Yeah.

14:10.768 --> 14:13.521
I'd like some too,
for the purposes of a toast.

14:13.604 --> 14:15.606
MRS. RICARDO:
Oh, uh, good idea.

14:19.527 --> 14:21.111
Um...

14:22.947 --> 14:25.950
I'm not the most eloquent guy
in the world.

14:26.867 --> 14:30.746
But I would like to say that
this has been a most lovely occasion.

14:30.829 --> 14:33.082
And I couldn't agree more.

14:33.165 --> 14:35.376
And on Sunday,
there's gonna be another occasion,

14:35.459 --> 14:38.128
even more lovely, more sacred.

14:38.879 --> 14:41.799
And all I really want to say is that

14:41.882 --> 14:43.884
I'm just honored

14:45.636 --> 14:48.889
and moved to be part of
the Kornpett family.

14:49.890 --> 14:54.311
And I hope we'll be together
in the good times to share 'em with joy.

14:55.396 --> 14:59.900
And if there are bad times,
God forbid, we'll work that out too,

14:59.984 --> 15:01.735
but together.

15:01.819 --> 15:03.195
- (Mrs. Kornpett sighs)
- Oh.

15:03.279 --> 15:06.198
- That was very lovely, Mr. Ricardo.
- Yeah, I feel the same way, Dad.

15:06.282 --> 15:07.533
(glasses clinking)

15:07.616 --> 15:09.910
Uh, I'd like to say that

15:09.994 --> 15:12.913
as difficult as it is for me
to give my little girl away,

15:12.997 --> 15:16.584
I'm very happy that it's to someone
as wonderful as Tommy.

15:16.667 --> 15:19.712
And my hope is that
the Kornpetts and Ricardos share

15:19.795 --> 15:22.756
many happy and peaceful occasions

15:22.840 --> 15:24.758
through many happy and peaceful years.

15:24.842 --> 15:27.052
- (sobbing loudly)
- Oh, hear, hear!

15:27.136 --> 15:29.471
(sobbing continues)

15:33.309 --> 15:35.811
(sobbing, hooting)

15:40.691 --> 15:42.610
Excuse me.
Where is the phone?

15:42.693 --> 15:44.528
Phone?

15:45.195 --> 15:48.657
- Uh, there's one in the kitchen.
- Where is the furthest one?

15:48.741 --> 15:50.784
I have to make a long-distance call,

15:50.868 --> 15:54.496
and sometimes with these overseas connections
I have to scream like a banshee.

15:54.580 --> 15:56.832
Well, there's one in the basement,
but it's a mess.

15:56.915 --> 15:58.334
Oh, that's okay.

15:58.417 --> 15:59.918
- Through there?
- Oh, I'll show you.

16:00.002 --> 16:02.004
Please, don't bother. I'll find it.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.715
- Dad and his mysterious phone calls.
- (all laughing)

16:04.798 --> 16:06.467
What did you say?

16:08.052 --> 16:10.971
I-I just said Dad
and his mysterious phone calls.

16:11.055 --> 16:12.723
What the hell do you mean by that?

16:12.806 --> 16:14.975
Nothing. Really.

16:15.059 --> 16:18.729
You're just always makin' these weird calls
in back rooms and pay booths.

16:18.812 --> 16:22.066
You little snot-nose!
Those phone calls put you through college!

16:22.149 --> 16:24.318
- Vince ‒
- I-I'm sure Tommy d-didn't mean ‒

16:24.401 --> 16:26.487
I worked myself up to a position

16:26.570 --> 16:30.574
where I can make these kind of
top-level phone calls to top businessmen,

16:30.658 --> 16:32.326
and my own son derogates.

16:32.409 --> 16:34.662
Dad, I wasn't derogating.

16:38.207 --> 16:40.042
Well, maybe you weren't.

16:43.420 --> 16:45.589
I'm terribly sorry, everybody.
It's been a long day.

16:45.673 --> 16:47.257
Oh, listen...

16:48.926 --> 16:50.844
- Through there?
- Yeah. First door to the left.

16:50.928 --> 16:54.014
- Pull the string for the light.
- Thanks a million.

16:57.768 --> 17:00.104
Um, he's, um ‒

17:00.187 --> 17:01.855
he's been working very hard lately.

17:01.939 --> 17:03.565
- Oh, listen...
- I mean n-normally, he's, uh ‒

17:03.649 --> 17:07.069
Usually he's so affectionate
and physical with Tommy.

17:07.152 --> 17:10.071
Listen, I can understand
a certain amount of resentment.

17:10.155 --> 17:13.617
After all, he's had to work really hard
in his life and I really haven't.

17:32.636 --> 17:34.555
It's Ricardo.

17:34.638 --> 17:36.056
Yes, very smoothly.

17:36.140 --> 17:39.435
But listen, that kind of money
by tomorrow, that's impossible.

17:40.936 --> 17:43.188
No, Ralph, you don't understand.

17:43.272 --> 17:45.190
This is a major international deal.

17:45.274 --> 17:48.277
It's not like we're fencing
some shit in the street.

17:49.653 --> 17:51.071
No, they're not all in there.

17:51.155 --> 17:54.533
I kept one out just in case
you pulled something like this.

17:54.616 --> 17:57.077
What's the point in threatening me?
You can't ‒

17:57.161 --> 17:58.662
Hello?

18:01.165 --> 18:02.833
Christ.

18:47.795 --> 18:50.297
- Dad, what are you talking about?
- What am I talkin' about?

18:50.380 --> 18:53.300
The man is crazy.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

18:53.383 --> 18:56.386
<i>He's</i> crazy? Look at yourself.
You're foaming at the mouth.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.097
Sweetheart ‒ It's toothpaste.

18:59.181 --> 19:02.100
Sweetheart, I love you very much,
but I know about these things.

19:02.184 --> 19:05.103
That man is crazy. I will not
have you marrying into that family.

19:05.187 --> 19:07.105
You're being absolutely Sicilian
about this.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.399
I'm marrying Tommy, not Vince.

19:09.483 --> 19:11.527
Mm-mmm. Tommy is the acorn.

19:12.569 --> 19:14.071
What acorn?

19:14.154 --> 19:16.365
The acorn, sweetheart, from the tree.

19:16.448 --> 19:18.826
- It's a saying.
- Oh.

19:18.909 --> 19:21.620
It's a great saying, Dad.
Really captures a whole lot.

19:21.703 --> 19:23.956
I don't need the sarcasm. It's off.

19:24.039 --> 19:26.166
- It is <i>not</i> off.
- It's off!

19:26.250 --> 19:28.502
I'm calling the caterers.
I'm calling the guests.

19:28.585 --> 19:31.046
It may be a little bit humiliating
and a little bit expensive,

19:31.129 --> 19:33.173
but you are not
marrying into that family.

19:33.257 --> 19:34.842
Damn it. We are not calling it off.

19:34.925 --> 19:38.387
Tommy and I are gonna go to Vegas
or some sleazy thing like that. I don't care.

19:38.470 --> 19:40.264
But we <i>are</i> getting married.

19:40.347 --> 19:44.184
- God, Mom, will you please tell him?
- I think you're being a little irrational.

19:44.268 --> 19:45.686
<i>I'm</i> being irrational?

19:45.769 --> 19:49.022
I sit there listening to stories
about the Guacamole Act of 1917

19:49.106 --> 19:51.024
and tsetse flies
carrying off small children,

19:51.108 --> 19:52.192
and I'm being irrational?

19:52.276 --> 19:53.861
Well, so he embellishes a little bit.

19:53.944 --> 19:57.573
First he's laughing, then he's crying,
then he practically belts Tommy in the mouth.

19:57.656 --> 19:59.867
He didn't practically
belt him in the mouth.

19:59.950 --> 20:01.869
He almost belted Tommy
in the mouth.

20:01.952 --> 20:05.122
Then he's gotta go down in the basement
to make phone calls. What is that?

20:05.205 --> 20:07.791
- And what else?
- I don't like, uh ‒

20:07.875 --> 20:09.459
I don't like his whole manner.

20:09.543 --> 20:11.837
And for that
you wanna call off the wedding?

20:11.920 --> 20:13.422
Shelly.

20:13.505 --> 20:16.008
You're just projecting like crazy.

20:16.091 --> 20:18.677
- Psychology on parade.
- Go on, Shelly. Let her talk.

20:18.760 --> 20:21.263
It isn't easy for fathers
to give away daughters.

20:21.346 --> 20:24.057
It's a complicated relationship.
There's sexual stuff going on ‒

20:24.141 --> 20:25.475
Hey, hey.

20:26.268 --> 20:28.520
I'm not talking about incest,
for Christ's sake.

20:28.604 --> 20:32.816
But there is a certain sexual component
to father-daughter relationships.

20:32.900 --> 20:36.570
So the closer the wedding gets, I think,
the more edgy you're gonna be

20:36.653 --> 20:40.324
and the more you're gonna fix on things
like Mr. Ricardo being a little flaky,

20:40.407 --> 20:41.909
which I'm not denying,

20:41.992 --> 20:45.704
as a reason to reject
the whole idea of marriage.

20:47.539 --> 20:49.249
I think she's right.

20:50.626 --> 20:53.420
$6,000 a year tuition to listen to this.

20:53.503 --> 20:57.507
- It doesn't make sense?
- No, it makes sense. It makes sense.

20:57.591 --> 20:58.800
I'm sorry.

20:58.884 --> 21:01.929
There's no reason to be sorry.

21:02.012 --> 21:04.932
All I want you to do is be more open
to Tommy's father.

21:05.015 --> 21:06.892
Don't just reject him.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.604
All right, I'll ‒
I'll try to be more open.

21:10.687 --> 21:14.066
Shelly, think how nervous he was
to meet you.

21:14.149 --> 21:16.610
Tommy's told him
so much about you.

21:16.693 --> 21:19.321
- Well, he must have been nervous.
- Sure he was nervous.

21:20.530 --> 21:22.115
Okay. Finished.

21:22.199 --> 21:23.575
I'll do my best.

21:23.659 --> 21:26.370
I'll just be incredibly receptive.

21:39.049 --> 21:42.344
It's in the middle of the next block,
just past the Stetson Hat sign.

21:42.427 --> 21:44.513
- 1270.
- Right.

21:52.354 --> 21:54.231
Christ. Keep going.

21:54.314 --> 21:57.442
- It's 1270, man.
- I said, keep going!

22:03.073 --> 22:05.325
Stupid bastards.

22:05.409 --> 22:08.036
Any particular place
you want me to go?

22:20.007 --> 22:22.426
731 Fifth Avenue. Pronto.

22:22.509 --> 22:24.011
Pronto it will be.

22:24.094 --> 22:26.096
(tires squealing)

22:28.515 --> 22:32.853
This is gonna set fast, Mrs. Adelman,
so just don't fight me.

22:32.936 --> 22:34.604
- Good.
- (mumbles)

22:34.688 --> 22:37.024
- No, it's looking good. Looking good.
- (mumbles)

22:37.107 --> 22:39.860
No, no, two more visits
oughta do it fine.

22:39.943 --> 22:42.195
Don't push out
with your tongue now, please.

22:42.279 --> 22:44.197
All right, let that stay in there.

22:44.281 --> 22:47.367
Now, you can relax your mouth,
but don't clench.

22:47.451 --> 22:49.536
- (mumbling)
- I'm watching a master at work.

22:49.619 --> 22:52.039
- What are you doing in here?
- Did I startle you folks?

22:52.122 --> 22:54.750
You're going to have to leave the office.
Dr. Kornpett, I'm sorry.

22:54.833 --> 22:57.127
I'm delighted to meet you.
I'm Vince Ricardo.

22:57.210 --> 23:00.047
Dr. Kornpett's wonderful daughter
is marrying my son.

23:00.130 --> 23:01.298
- (Mrs. Adelman mumbles)
- My in-law.

23:01.381 --> 23:02.549
- Hello, dear.
- Barbara's ‒

23:03.341 --> 23:06.762
This is some great dentist you have here.
You're a very lucky lady.

23:06.845 --> 23:09.097
- (mumbling)
- No kidding.

23:09.181 --> 23:10.891
I didn't expect to see you, Vince.

23:10.974 --> 23:14.436
Well, I was just in the neighborhood
and I thought I'd say howdy-doo.

23:14.519 --> 23:17.522
- Is there anything I can do for you?
- No, just wanted to say hello.

23:17.606 --> 23:19.858
Uh-huh.
Well, come on back in my office.

23:19.941 --> 23:21.610
- I don't want to intrude.
- No, no intrusion.

23:21.693 --> 23:23.236
Mrs. Adelman, sit tight.
Don't clench.

23:23.320 --> 23:25.072
- Do what the doc says now.
- Vince.

23:25.155 --> 23:27.908
- You're very sweet.
- Vince!

23:28.992 --> 23:31.119
(mumbling)

23:32.996 --> 23:36.166
That's a wonderful patient you got there.
Very fine lady.

23:36.249 --> 23:37.667
Oh, yeah? You know her?

23:37.751 --> 23:40.253
No, but I can tell
she's a woman of real quality.

23:42.339 --> 23:44.216
- The inner sanctum, huh?
- Yeah.

23:44.299 --> 23:46.927
- Remember that show, <i>The Inner Sanctum?</i>
- Oh, yeah, sure.

23:47.010 --> 23:49.513
- Boy, I never missed it.
- (Sheldon clears throat)

23:51.139 --> 23:53.934
- Do you understand Latin, Sheldon?
- Yeah, a little.

23:55.727 --> 23:57.771
You know what all this means?

23:57.854 --> 24:02.275
Yeah. It means, uh, I won't get arrested
for impersonating a dentist.

24:02.359 --> 24:05.362
- (Vince laughing)
- (Sheldon chuckles)

24:05.445 --> 24:07.572
Oh, that's very funny.

24:07.656 --> 24:09.449
Impersonating a dentist.

24:09.533 --> 24:11.743
That's very cute.

24:11.827 --> 24:13.578
(laughing continues)

24:15.205 --> 24:17.124
Oh, dear.

24:17.207 --> 24:19.626
Well, I'm really glad
you stopped by, Vince.

24:19.709 --> 24:22.796
Well, I feel we're practically family now.
I like to feel close.

24:22.879 --> 24:24.923
Listen, any time
you're in the neighborhood.

24:25.006 --> 24:28.385
That's very kind of you, Shel. And don't
think I'm gonna abuse the privilege.

24:28.468 --> 24:29.886
No, no, no, no.

24:29.970 --> 24:32.389
I'm not one of those guys
who you give him an inch ‒

24:32.472 --> 24:35.475
- No, no, no, no. Any time.
- Oh, wonderful.

24:35.559 --> 24:38.728
Gee, but I can see how busy you are.
Gosh, the waiting room is filled.

24:38.812 --> 24:42.983
- Yeah, well, I have a good practice.
- Yeah, it looks like an absolute gold mine.

24:43.066 --> 24:45.193
- (chuckles)
- You keep hoppin', huh?

24:45.277 --> 24:46.903
Yeah, yeah.

24:48.530 --> 24:52.033
I guess if I were to ask you
to leave the office for a couple minutes,

24:52.117 --> 24:54.035
that wouldn't be possible, would it?

24:54.119 --> 24:56.079
Well, it would depend.

24:56.163 --> 24:57.497
What about right now?

24:57.581 --> 24:59.541
"What about right now" what?

24:59.624 --> 25:02.502
Could I borrow you
for a couple minutes?

25:02.586 --> 25:04.045
Right now?

25:04.129 --> 25:07.424
Would it be terribly inconvenient?
Please say so if it is.

25:07.507 --> 25:10.260
I just thought
because it was around lunch.

25:11.428 --> 25:13.346
Vince, it's 9:00 in the morning.

25:13.430 --> 25:16.016
You never take an early lunch?

25:17.350 --> 25:21.229
I have a lot of patients out there, Vince.
Could you tell me what you want?

25:21.313 --> 25:24.733
Oh, it's such a minor thing.
Gosh, I'm so embarrassed.

25:24.816 --> 25:27.235
I-I hate to ask. It's just that ‒

25:27.319 --> 25:29.613
I need a hand
for maybe five minutes.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.740
Five minutes.

25:31.823 --> 25:35.327
I-I got a cab waiting downstairs.
Five minutes tops.

25:36.077 --> 25:37.871
Vince, I'd really like to help you out,

25:37.954 --> 25:40.373
but I have two impacted molars
and a gold crown out there.

25:40.457 --> 25:41.625
I'm all backed up.

25:41.708 --> 25:45.128
Well, listen, what the hell.
I can do it myself. You're so busy.

25:45.879 --> 25:48.840
Vince, can't this wait till this afternoon?
I'll be off around 5:00.

25:48.924 --> 25:52.844
No, no, I can manage. I don't want to
make a federal case out of this.

25:52.928 --> 25:54.804
This is really important to you?

25:56.181 --> 25:58.350
It would be so helpful,
you can't imagine.

25:58.433 --> 26:00.435
Like I say, it's no big deal.

26:01.937 --> 26:03.396
(sighs)

26:03.480 --> 26:05.649
What the hell.
I never get out of here anyway.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.651
What's five minutes
for a member of the family?

26:07.734 --> 26:09.903
Aw, Shel, this is
just stupendous of you.

26:09.986 --> 26:11.780
- And you might even enjoy it.
- Yeah?

26:11.863 --> 26:15.325
- Where we going?
- My office. I want you to break into my safe.

26:26.628 --> 26:28.004
(woman screaming)

26:35.011 --> 26:38.098
The Eagle has landed.
What now?

26:38.181 --> 26:40.433
Just put your flashers on
and stay put.

26:40.517 --> 26:41.810
Are we still moving?

26:41.893 --> 26:44.521
No, the cab has stopped.
We're on West 31st Street.

26:44.604 --> 26:46.606
Did we hit the little boy
on Sixth Avenue?

26:46.690 --> 26:49.276
No, no, we missed him
by a good foot and a half.

26:49.359 --> 26:51.361
Okay, now.

26:51.444 --> 26:54.864
This is the combination to the safe,
and this is the key to the office.

26:54.948 --> 26:57.367
And the safe is behind
the picture of President Kennedy.

26:57.450 --> 26:58.535
Correct.

26:58.618 --> 27:02.163
So I open the safe, take out a black bag
and come back here to the cab.

27:02.247 --> 27:03.456
- With the bag.
- With the bag.

27:03.540 --> 27:06.459
And there might be two guys hanging around
outside the front of the building

27:06.543 --> 27:08.211
who should not see the bag.

27:08.295 --> 27:10.046
It's a possibility.

27:10.130 --> 27:13.133
Who are these guys?
What, are they after you or what?

27:14.301 --> 27:17.053
You know you got
a terrific imagination, Shel.

27:17.137 --> 27:19.306
No, these are my competitors.
You know.

27:19.389 --> 27:24.477
And if they see me with this black bag,
then I lose my competitive edge. That's all.

27:24.561 --> 27:25.937
Macy's and Gimbels.

27:26.021 --> 27:28.648
That's a terrific example, Shel.
Really.

27:28.732 --> 27:30.984
All right, let's get this over with.

27:35.322 --> 27:36.823
- Shelly!
- What?

27:37.532 --> 27:39.200
I'll never forget this.

27:39.284 --> 27:40.744
Good.

28:06.269 --> 28:08.438
- I'll stand still, all right?
- Happens all the time. Excuse me.

28:08.521 --> 28:11.941
- Doc, uh, makin' a house call?
- Yeah, it's one of those emergencies.

28:13.276 --> 28:15.779
That door never opens.
Use this one.

28:19.407 --> 28:20.950
(key drops on floor)

28:27.624 --> 28:29.376
Awfully nervous, isn't he?

28:29.459 --> 28:31.127
Keeps dropping things.

28:31.211 --> 28:33.004
- You think that ‒
- Maybe.

28:33.088 --> 28:34.589
Come on.

28:43.181 --> 28:46.226
- That's it.
- Pretty cute usin' a doc.

29:21.719 --> 29:23.888
Very nice. Very nice.

29:28.601 --> 29:31.688
Four years at Mount Holyoke
so she can marry into this.

29:48.538 --> 29:51.374
"To Vince. Well, at least we tried.
Thanks for everything.

29:51.458 --> 29:53.376
Yours, John F. Kennedy."

29:53.460 --> 29:55.128
(chuckles)

30:14.731 --> 30:17.734
(muttering)

30:19.068 --> 30:20.695
(door handle rattling)

30:22.405 --> 30:24.574
SHELDON:
Is that Vince?

30:31.789 --> 30:33.666
Nothing personal, pal.
It's strictly business.

30:33.750 --> 30:37.837
No! I'm not him. Uh, he's my in-law.
Look, here's my card.

30:37.921 --> 30:39.422
(gunshot)

30:53.520 --> 30:56.022
Goddamn. You take the fire escape.
I'll take the stairs. Go.

30:57.607 --> 31:00.568
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

31:05.949 --> 31:08.952
There's no reason to shoot at me!
I'm a dentist!

31:16.125 --> 31:18.878
GAME SHOW HOST (on TV):
<i>Five. May we see us in a five.</i>

31:18.962 --> 31:22.340
- What is this show?
- Are you kidding, man?

31:22.423 --> 31:25.969
<i>The Price is Right.</i>
This is the all-American game show.

31:27.136 --> 31:29.722
And they're supposed to
guess what all that crap is worth?

31:29.806 --> 31:31.474
- I mean, is that the principle?
- Yeah, right.

31:31.558 --> 31:33.434
Aha.

31:35.144 --> 31:37.897
May I have some milk, please?

31:37.981 --> 31:40.525
- Is this coffee freeze-dried, by the way?
- Yes, it is.

31:40.608 --> 31:41.776
It's very good.

31:44.279 --> 31:46.531
How long has this show
been on the air?

31:46.614 --> 31:48.992
Since about 1911.

31:49.075 --> 31:52.912
Hey, I can't believe you never heard
of <i>The Price is Right.</i>

31:52.996 --> 31:56.249
Well, I don't see that much television.
I'm out of the country a lot.

31:56.332 --> 31:57.834
Really? What do you do?

31:57.917 --> 31:59.836
I work for the CIA.

32:23.484 --> 32:24.861
(gunshot)

32:27.780 --> 32:30.325
Shit! Emergency!
Open the door!

32:33.369 --> 32:35.288
This <i>is</i> an emergency.

32:58.269 --> 33:00.188
(horn honking)

33:06.736 --> 33:08.363
(grunts)

33:15.912 --> 33:17.664
- (tires screech)
- (horn honks)

33:22.377 --> 33:24.504
I can't believe you work for the CIA.

33:24.587 --> 33:26.673
Why not?

33:26.756 --> 33:28.007
I don't know.

33:28.091 --> 33:31.177
I mean, you know,
I thought like, uh, James Bond.

33:31.260 --> 33:33.513
Oh, no, they all look like me.

33:33.596 --> 33:35.473
I'm the classic agency type.

33:35.556 --> 33:38.685
Muscular, low to the ground, compact.

33:38.768 --> 33:42.438
Are you interested in joining?
I'll tell ya, the benefits are fantastic.

33:42.522 --> 33:46.526
The trick is not to get killed.
That's really the key to the benefit program.

33:58.204 --> 34:01.290
Oh, God, don't let me die
on West 31st Street.

34:02.208 --> 34:04.127
Vince!

34:04.961 --> 34:06.713
- Hey, your friend is back.
- (Sheldon shouting)

34:06.796 --> 34:09.297
- Okeydoke.
- Vince!

34:10.425 --> 34:12.051
Help! Help!

34:12.135 --> 34:13.594
- Are we square with you?
- MAN: Yeah.

34:13.678 --> 34:15.888
Aah! Aah! Help!

34:15.972 --> 34:17.431
Give me the bag.

34:18.181 --> 34:19.766
Vince!

34:20.643 --> 34:22.145
Don't shoot!

34:25.648 --> 34:27.567
- No!
- Give me that bag.

34:49.088 --> 34:50.590
Sheldon?

34:51.757 --> 34:53.259
Shelly?

34:57.555 --> 35:00.016
Shel, you all right?

35:00.767 --> 35:01.809
Hey, watch out!

35:04.395 --> 35:08.107
(siren wailing)

35:08.733 --> 35:11.652
We really gotta get out of here.
Shel, give me your hand.

35:11.736 --> 35:14.739
(siren continues wailing)

35:16.324 --> 35:18.326
Cabbie, we're going on.

35:26.042 --> 35:29.086
Shelly, I'm really sorry
it turned out this way. I had no idea ‒

35:29.170 --> 35:31.756
- How could you? I almost got killed.
- I know.

35:31.839 --> 35:34.759
You have dinner at my house,
you drag me out of my office,

35:34.842 --> 35:36.594
then set me up to get killed?

35:36.677 --> 35:39.388
- I'd really like a chance to explain.
- No explaining!

35:39.472 --> 35:41.474
Just get out of my life!

35:43.309 --> 35:45.728
- I understand completely.
- You don't understand anything!

35:45.812 --> 35:50.817
I understand that you are a raving lunatic
and I want you out of my life!

35:55.279 --> 35:58.407
- I can sympathize with your feelings.
- Don't come in. I want you out of my life.

35:58.491 --> 36:00.326
I would like to oblige,
but I have a conscience.

36:00.409 --> 36:02.662
Go away from me.
Don't look at me or talk to me.

36:02.745 --> 36:04.080
- I feel terrible.
- Go away!

36:04.163 --> 36:08.459
This man's wonderful daughter
is marrying my son the day after tomorrow.

36:08.543 --> 36:11.546
- (excited chattering)
- Doc, I want to congratulate you.

36:11.629 --> 36:13.214
- Congratulations!
- Thanks a lot.

36:13.297 --> 36:15.174
I'm very sorry for the delay.

36:15.258 --> 36:18.678
- I'll get to you as soon as I can.
- Please!

36:19.846 --> 36:21.764
(groans)

36:21.848 --> 36:24.684
Oh, Mrs. Adelman,
you've been still the entire time.

36:24.767 --> 36:27.478
Can you close your mouth?
Can you bite down?

36:27.562 --> 36:29.188
(grunting)

36:29.272 --> 36:31.357
- Shelly?
- Mrs. Adelman cannot close her mouth.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.192
She cannot bite down.

36:33.276 --> 36:36.571
- This is why we have to talk.
- What is that?

36:36.654 --> 36:39.740
To be perfectly candid, Shel,

36:39.824 --> 36:41.993
these are engravings for US currency

36:42.076 --> 36:44.412
which were stolen yesterday
from the United States Mint.

36:44.495 --> 36:46.789
Now, the thing we have to talk about

36:46.873 --> 36:50.751
is your unwitting participation
in this serious federal crime.

36:51.502 --> 36:56.132
A crime punishable by a maximum sentence
of 40 years in a federal penitentiary.

37:09.937 --> 37:11.772
You can rinse now, dear.

37:11.856 --> 37:13.357
Sheldon?

37:16.235 --> 37:19.572
Um, why don't you just stack it up
over there on this side of the furnace.

37:19.655 --> 37:21.282
That way, it'll be easy to get at.

37:21.365 --> 37:24.201
- Day after tomorrow, huh, Mrs. Kornpett?
- Oh, God, don't mention it.

37:24.285 --> 37:25.578
There's so much to do.

37:25.661 --> 37:28.372
Anything we can do to help,
feel free to call us, huh?

37:28.456 --> 37:30.791
You're really very sweet.
I'm getting a little nervous about ‒

37:30.875 --> 37:32.877
- Oh, be careful.
- (grunts)

37:32.960 --> 37:35.129
- Oh, are you okay?
- Yeah.

37:35.212 --> 37:37.590
That blasted thing
just falls apart all the time.

37:37.673 --> 37:40.259
One day we're gonna have to
get around to getting it fixed.

37:40.343 --> 37:42.011
- Hey, look at this.
- What?

37:43.220 --> 37:45.348
It's 500.

37:45.431 --> 37:48.601
What? What'd you ‒
Wh-What'd you say this is?

37:48.684 --> 37:51.687
It's an engraving for a bill.
Here, look.

37:51.771 --> 37:53.773
"The United States of America."

37:54.941 --> 37:57.860
Maybe it's from the previous owners
or something.

37:57.944 --> 38:01.322
Oh, I doubt it.
We've lived here for 15 years.

38:01.405 --> 38:04.450
No, that's brand-new.

38:04.533 --> 38:07.328
Isn't that the damnedest thing?
Right here in the cellar.

38:07.411 --> 38:10.456
People find all kinds of things
in the cellar.

38:10.539 --> 38:12.792
I just can't imagine.

38:12.875 --> 38:15.962
Huh. What do you think
I should do with it?

38:16.045 --> 38:19.423
- I never seen one of 'em.
- Take it to the bank, honey. They'll know.

38:19.507 --> 38:21.300
- You think so?
- Sure.

38:21.384 --> 38:23.302
Ah, you're probably right.

38:32.937 --> 38:34.939
- Hi.
- Hello, Mrs. Kornpett.

38:35.022 --> 38:37.692
- All set for the wedding?
- (sighs) Well, we're getting there.

38:37.775 --> 38:39.610
How's Barbara?
Is she nervous?

38:39.694 --> 38:41.988
She doesn't show it,
but I'm sure she is.

38:42.071 --> 38:44.198
My husband's
the jumpiest one of all right now.

38:44.281 --> 38:45.741
Isn't that always the case?

38:45.825 --> 38:49.537
There's just some things that men
don't handle as well as we do.

38:49.620 --> 38:52.081
- I suppose so.
- Now, what can we do for you today?

38:52.164 --> 38:54.500
- Cash a check, I'll bet.
- No, not really.

38:54.583 --> 38:57.086
I... I found something.

38:57.169 --> 39:00.172
Believe it or not, I found this
in my cellar this morning and I ‒

39:00.256 --> 39:03.509
I just don't know what to make of it
or what I should do with it.

39:03.592 --> 39:05.636
- Hmm. It's heavy, isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

39:05.720 --> 39:08.806
My goodness,
this is some kind of engraving.

39:08.889 --> 39:10.182
For a 500.

39:10.266 --> 39:12.351
Yeah, you're right.

39:12.435 --> 39:14.937
You found this in your cellar,
Mrs. Kornpett?

39:15.021 --> 39:17.857
- This morning.
- Well, I never have that kind of luck.

39:17.940 --> 39:21.527
Do you have any idea of what
I should do with it or what it's worth?

39:21.610 --> 39:24.071
Oh, gee, I really don't know.

39:24.155 --> 39:26.532
I've never even seen one of these.

39:26.615 --> 39:29.285
I could ask our branch manager.
Do you mind waiting?

39:29.368 --> 39:32.079
No, not really.
I'd like to resolve this somehow.

39:32.163 --> 39:34.290
Well, sure. I don't blame you.
Let me ask him.

39:34.373 --> 39:36.000
- Okay.
- Hi.

39:36.083 --> 39:37.209
- Oh.
- Ready?

39:37.293 --> 39:38.711
In a second.

39:38.794 --> 39:41.255
- Did you get your shoes?
- No, they were all awful.

39:41.338 --> 39:44.050
I got some tennis sneakers
so it wouldn't be a total loss.

39:44.133 --> 39:46.677
- You've gotta get some shoes.
- I know, I know.

39:46.761 --> 39:48.054
Tomorrow we'll go into the city.

39:48.137 --> 39:50.556
I'll try Bloomingdale's,
I. Miller and Bendel's.

39:50.639 --> 39:53.309
Worse comes to worst,
I'll wear my clogs on Sunday.

39:53.392 --> 39:55.811
You're not going to wear clogs
at your wedding.

39:55.895 --> 39:57.480
Nobody'll see 'em.

39:58.898 --> 40:00.983
- My God.
- What?

40:03.110 --> 40:05.237
Look at this.

40:05.321 --> 40:07.740
Let's not fight about it.
I'll go into the city tomorrow.

40:07.823 --> 40:10.534
I'll probably find
an acceptable pair of shoes.

40:10.618 --> 40:13.079
- Clogs are out of the question.
- Will you stop?

40:13.162 --> 40:14.747
- Mrs. Kornpett?
- Yes.

40:14.830 --> 40:17.792
Would you mind stepping over
to my office for a moment?

40:28.511 --> 40:30.346
You feeling a little better?

40:32.014 --> 40:35.476
You were smart to order that split pea soup.
That looks delicious. May I?

40:38.020 --> 40:41.398
Mmm. It's very nice.
It's a little greasy, but it's very nice.

40:41.482 --> 40:45.277
Crumble up some saltines into it, Shel.
That will absorb the grease.

40:47.321 --> 40:50.449
Shel, when I speak, do you hear me?
Do you understand the words?

40:50.533 --> 40:52.118
- Yeah.
- Well, that's good.

40:52.201 --> 40:54.120
That's a relief.
I was beginning to get worried.

40:54.203 --> 40:56.747
I thought maybe all this excitement
had gotten to you.

40:56.831 --> 40:58.707
Let me see if I got this straight.

40:58.791 --> 41:00.918
- You work for the CIA.
- That's right.

41:01.001 --> 41:02.795
You've been with them how long?
Twenty years?

41:02.878 --> 41:04.046
Since Eisenhower.

41:04.130 --> 41:06.799
And you robbed
the United States Mint for the CIA.

41:06.882 --> 41:08.509
- Is that correct?
- Completely.

41:08.592 --> 41:11.303
Okay. Let me ask you a question.

41:11.387 --> 41:13.556
Since when is it the policy of the CIA

41:13.639 --> 41:17.935
to impress private citizens into their service
without telling them what it's about

41:18.018 --> 41:20.229
so that individuals of high standing
in the community

41:20.312 --> 41:23.482
end up running down the streets
with bullets flying past their heads?

41:23.566 --> 41:25.317
- That was a mistake.
- Some mistake.

41:25.401 --> 41:28.195
- Thank God nobody was hurt.
- How do you justify such behavior?

41:28.279 --> 41:29.655
Shel, I didn't do it lightly.

41:29.738 --> 41:33.242
It was done in the name of something pretty
important which you couldn't understand.

41:33.325 --> 41:36.120
<i>- I</i> couldn't understand?
- No, it is too complicated.

41:36.203 --> 41:37.830
I read the newspapers.

41:37.913 --> 41:39.331
I graduated second in my class.

41:39.415 --> 41:41.792
Don't underestimate
the man in the street, buddy.

41:41.876 --> 41:44.003
All right, you got a point.
You're right.

41:44.086 --> 41:46.088
When you're right, you're right.

41:47.006 --> 41:50.050
Okay, try and follow me, Shel.

41:51.844 --> 41:55.681
This whole thing has to do with a conspiracy
that originated in Central America

41:55.764 --> 41:58.350
against the economy
of the United States.

41:58.434 --> 42:01.687
We first got wind of it nine months ago
when they robbed the German mint.

42:01.770 --> 42:05.357
Well, actually, they robbed ‒
they robbed the English mint,

42:05.441 --> 42:08.944
<i>then</i> the German mint,
and then the Swiss mint.

42:09.028 --> 42:11.447
- And they never took any money.
- Who did this?

42:11.530 --> 42:13.532
- It's a Latin-American syndicate.
- Okay.

42:13.616 --> 42:15.451
- They only took the plates.
- Mm-hmm.

42:15.534 --> 42:19.622
Now, what you have to understand is that
we have information ‒ the agency has ‒

42:19.705 --> 42:21.624
- The CIA.
- You're goddamn right, buddy.

42:21.707 --> 42:23.292
The CIA.

42:23.375 --> 42:27.171
We know that these plates
are going down to Central America,

42:27.254 --> 42:30.424
and these people intend to run off
billions of dollars of this currency.

42:30.507 --> 42:32.885
- They want to obliterate their debts.
- What debts?

42:32.968 --> 42:35.512
Well, all these countries, Shel,

42:35.596 --> 42:39.099
they all owe billions of dollars to the West,
and they can never pay it back.

42:39.183 --> 42:42.019
- Right. Right.
- They're too poor. You know that.

42:42.102 --> 42:45.731
Their only hope is worldwide inflation.

42:45.814 --> 42:47.816
But it has to be a huge one.

42:47.900 --> 42:51.111
I mean, so big that paper money
is not worth anything.

42:51.195 --> 42:53.197
- You use it for wallpaper.
- Mmm.

42:53.280 --> 42:55.658
Now, once they get these plates ‒

42:55.741 --> 42:57.284
- the ones that I robbed yesterday ‒
- Yes?

42:57.368 --> 43:00.412
which is American dollars,
now they're all set.

43:00.496 --> 43:01.830
Set for what?

43:01.914 --> 43:04.875
What do you think's gonna happen
when they start running off this dough,

43:04.959 --> 43:09.129
and suddenly there's trillions of extra
dollars, francs and marks floating around?

43:09.213 --> 43:11.548
You've got a collapse
of confidence in the currency.

43:11.632 --> 43:13.092
- Right.
- People are gonna panic.

43:13.175 --> 43:14.843
- Yeah.
- There's gonna be gold riots.

43:14.927 --> 43:18.389
Atonal music.
Political chaos. Mass suicide.

43:18.472 --> 43:19.890
- Right?
- Yeah.

43:19.974 --> 43:21.225
It's Germany before Hitler.

43:21.308 --> 43:22.935
- You can see that.
- Yeah.

43:23.018 --> 43:24.270
Jesus.

43:24.353 --> 43:28.232
I don't know what people are gonna do
when a six-pack of Budweiser costs $1,200.

43:28.315 --> 43:30.359
Oh, that would be awful.

43:31.652 --> 43:34.446
- You think I'm bullshitting, don't ya?
- No, I don't. I don't.

43:34.530 --> 43:37.283
- Well, <i>they</i> thought I was bullshitting.
- Who thought you were bullshitting?

43:37.366 --> 43:38.993
The CIA.

43:39.076 --> 43:40.327
I told 'em.

43:40.411 --> 43:43.289
I said, fellas, the thing to do
is to rob the US Mint.

43:43.372 --> 43:45.749
Really rob it. Professionally.

43:45.833 --> 43:48.460
With real gangsters and real guns.

43:48.544 --> 43:51.297
Get the engraving,
go to Central America,

43:51.380 --> 43:54.133
smoke out the action
and nail those bastards.

43:54.216 --> 43:57.011
They thought it was too risky.
Turned it down.

43:57.094 --> 44:00.097
Wait a minute. W-Wait a minute.
The CIA turned this down?

44:00.180 --> 44:02.308
- I thought you were doing it for them.
- I am.

44:02.391 --> 44:06.270
- Well, th-then they're behind you.
- No, this I did on my own.

44:07.062 --> 44:09.106
You robbed the United States Mint
on your own?

44:09.189 --> 44:11.984
- The CIA thought it was too crazy?
- Too risky, Shel.

44:12.067 --> 44:14.695
So you went ahead and robbed it
on your own, with gangsters.

44:14.778 --> 44:17.489
- You committed a federal crime!
- Of course it's federal.

44:17.573 --> 44:19.408
The Treasury Department is on the case.

44:19.491 --> 44:22.328
- So what happens if you get caught?
- We won't get caught, not if we ‒

44:22.411 --> 44:23.787
Stop the "we"!

44:23.871 --> 44:27.666
If you get caught, is the agency gonna
come forward, say it's okay, he works for us?

44:27.750 --> 44:28.834
- No.
- No.

44:28.917 --> 44:31.170
No. I'm out in the cold
on this one, Shel.

44:31.253 --> 44:34.340
If I get caught, they shred my records,
they say they never heard of me,

44:34.423 --> 44:36.050
and it's 20 years in the slammer.

44:36.133 --> 44:39.178
What about me? I was the one running
through the streets with that goddamn thing.

44:39.261 --> 44:41.180
I was the one in the gutter.

44:41.263 --> 44:42.806
And you were tremendous, Shel.

44:42.890 --> 44:46.352
The way you handled yourself,
I can't tell you how impressed I was.

44:46.435 --> 44:49.688
No, I mean this. It's been something
I've been wanting to say.

44:49.772 --> 44:51.815
You were sensational, Shel,

44:51.899 --> 44:55.861
and it's an act of friendship
that I will remember for as long as I live.

44:55.944 --> 44:59.531
- Which could be about an hour.
- So what do I got? An hour and a half?

44:59.615 --> 45:02.034
You have nothing to worry about.
You're an innocent victim.

45:02.117 --> 45:03.369
How so?

45:03.452 --> 45:06.580
I know it, and the cab driver knows it.
We both say it.

45:07.539 --> 45:09.124
(sighs)

45:09.208 --> 45:11.418
- What happens to you?
- Oh, I'll manage.

45:11.502 --> 45:13.629
Listen, I've been
in tougher jams before.

45:13.712 --> 45:16.131
You know, back when Kennedy
was president ‒

45:16.215 --> 45:18.467
- You saw the picture in the office?
- Yes, I did.

45:18.550 --> 45:20.719
- He was crazy about me.
- I was very impressed.

45:20.803 --> 45:22.888
Honey, do you have the check?

45:22.971 --> 45:24.723
Listen, let me ask you
about that picture.

45:24.807 --> 45:27.810
What did that inscription mean?
"At least we tried."

45:27.893 --> 45:30.562
Bay of Pigs.
That referred to the Bay of Pigs.

45:30.646 --> 45:32.648
You were involved
with the Bay of Pigs?

45:33.440 --> 45:36.402
Involved? That was my idea.

45:36.485 --> 45:37.986
I'll get this, Shel.

45:40.531 --> 45:41.824
The Bay of Pigs.

45:41.907 --> 45:43.575
You win some, you lose some.

45:43.659 --> 45:46.286
Listen, you gonna be home
in about an hour?

45:46.370 --> 45:47.496
Why?

45:47.579 --> 45:49.998
I want to make sure we get
that engraving out of your house.

45:50.082 --> 45:51.417
What engraving?

45:51.500 --> 45:53.919
Last night, I thoughtlessly
left one in your basement.

45:54.002 --> 45:56.422
- An engraving from the bag?
- In my haste.

45:56.505 --> 45:57.923
In my basement?

45:58.006 --> 46:01.718
- Why are you getting so excited?
- Why am I getting so excited?

46:01.802 --> 46:05.597
The central piece of evidence in the biggest
federal crime since the atomic spy case

46:05.681 --> 46:07.141
is sitting in my basement!

46:07.224 --> 46:09.143
You want to know
why I'm getting excited!

46:09.226 --> 46:11.770
Go back to your lunches!
Do I meddle in your business?

46:11.854 --> 46:14.231
- I want that thing out of my house!
- Shelly.

46:14.314 --> 46:16.316
I'm getting to that.
Sit down. Finish your soup.

46:16.400 --> 46:19.486
- I don't want to sit down. I don't want my soup.
- You hardly touched it.

46:19.570 --> 46:21.697
- Stop with the soup!
- All right, relax.

46:23.198 --> 46:24.575
Now, the thing ‒

46:24.658 --> 46:28.120
We'll call it the thing. Okay, Shel?
But you know I mean the engraving.

46:28.203 --> 46:30.497
The thing will be
out of your house in two hours.

46:30.581 --> 46:34.293
A man calling himself D. Tracy
will come to your home wearing galoshes.

46:34.376 --> 46:35.878
Give him the thing, okay?

46:35.961 --> 46:37.212
Let me explain something to you.

46:37.296 --> 46:40.674
If that thing isn't out of my house
in two hours, so help me God, Vince ‒

46:40.757 --> 46:42.718
I understand your feelings.
Believe me.

46:42.801 --> 46:45.512
But it's gonna be gone by 5:00.
Believe me.

46:45.596 --> 46:48.223
And years from now we're gonna
look back on this whole thing,

46:48.307 --> 46:51.477
sitting around a Christmas tree,
and we're all gonna have a big laugh.

46:51.560 --> 46:53.187
I gotta run, Sheldon.

46:53.270 --> 46:57.065
Remember ‒
D. Tracy, galoshes.

47:01.528 --> 47:05.741
Complete stranger.
He sat down here next to me.

47:05.824 --> 47:08.160
Never saw him before in my life.

47:17.252 --> 47:20.589
I wish it was absurd, Mrs. Kornpett,
but it's a very serious matter.

47:20.672 --> 47:23.342
This is ridiculous.
I feel like Bonnie and Clyde.

47:23.425 --> 47:25.427
Nothing else in the basement.

47:25.511 --> 47:28.138
How long has your husband
practiced dentistry, Mrs. Kornpett?

47:28.222 --> 47:30.516
He's had his own practice since 1960.

47:30.599 --> 47:32.851
- Always in New York?
- That's right.

47:32.935 --> 47:36.104
He shared a practice with Dr. Murray Weingard
for two years in Brooklyn,

47:36.188 --> 47:38.690
then opened his own practice
in Manhattan.

47:38.774 --> 47:42.277
He was sergeant at arms
at the Long Island Dentists Guild.

47:42.361 --> 47:43.904
He's always kept regular hours?

47:43.987 --> 47:47.616
He comes through that door
at 7:00 every single evening.

47:47.699 --> 47:49.701
Any tax trouble?

47:49.785 --> 47:50.994
None.

47:51.078 --> 47:52.496
He overpays.

47:52.579 --> 47:56.333
His accountant tells him to take all
these deductions, but he never does.

47:56.416 --> 47:59.795
Um, please, could you tell me
what this is all about?

47:59.878 --> 48:01.296
What's with the engraving?

48:01.380 --> 48:03.674
That's what we'd like to know,
Mrs. Kornpett.

48:03.757 --> 48:07.970
But I'm sure if everything you've told us is
accurate, there's a very simple explanation.

48:08.053 --> 48:09.888
This is so insane.

48:09.972 --> 48:11.723
When you meet my father ‒

48:11.807 --> 48:15.143
I mean, he's the least likely person
to be mixed up in anything.

48:22.317 --> 48:23.819
BMW pulling in.

48:23.902 --> 48:26.154
That's my husband.
You can talk to him yourself.

48:31.827 --> 48:33.495
Holy shit.

48:33.579 --> 48:35.706
- BMW pulling out!
- Let's go!

48:36.832 --> 48:38.500
What's going on here?

48:39.167 --> 48:41.753
I'm gonna tear his goddamn heart out!

48:41.837 --> 48:43.463
AGENT:
Come on! Let's go!

48:45.757 --> 48:47.259
Let's go!

48:59.855 --> 49:02.357
God, Mom, what is this?

49:02.441 --> 49:04.943
- Of course.
- What?

49:05.027 --> 49:07.279
- Who was in the basement last night?
- Who?

49:07.362 --> 49:09.489
(gasps)
Oh, Jesus. Mr. Ricardo.

49:09.573 --> 49:13.035
That crazy little bastard,
he's involved your poor father in something.

49:31.428 --> 49:34.306
I'll kill him.
I swear to God, I'll kill him!

49:37.893 --> 49:40.395
Oh, my God!

49:56.370 --> 49:58.080
- (horn honking)
- Watch out! Look out!

50:03.418 --> 50:05.712
- (gasps) Watch out!
- (horn honks)

50:13.387 --> 50:15.430
(tires squealing)

50:25.774 --> 50:27.901
Well, where the hell is he?

50:27.984 --> 50:29.736
Check the corner.

50:42.624 --> 50:44.418
Beautiful job, isn't it?

50:44.501 --> 50:46.628
Uh, that'll be 30 bucks.

50:46.712 --> 50:49.297
Uh, you can pay me.
My dad's having supper.

50:49.381 --> 50:52.551
It's worth it. Man, believe me,
that's a quality paint job.

50:52.634 --> 50:55.804
It never wears out,
and you can't paint over it.

50:57.139 --> 50:59.474
- Do you have a phone?
- What?

50:59.558 --> 51:00.767
Phone! Phone!

51:00.851 --> 51:02.310
Over there!

51:05.355 --> 51:07.065
Medium rare all right for everybody?

51:07.149 --> 51:10.026
- Well for me, Vince.
- You asked for it, you got it.

51:10.110 --> 51:12.571
It's nice having Vince around
for a couple of days.

51:12.654 --> 51:14.281
Took a wedding to do it.

51:14.364 --> 51:16.491
And well worth it.
I'm having a wonderful time.

51:16.575 --> 51:18.493
What do you think
of Tommy's new in-laws?

51:18.577 --> 51:20.871
Delightful. Wonderful.
Wonderful people.

51:20.954 --> 51:25.250
I had this instant chemical reaction, you know,
that these were really special people.

51:25.333 --> 51:27.461
- (phone ringing)
- I'll get it.

51:27.544 --> 51:30.338
No, I'm expecting a call from Zurich, honey.
You watch the chow.

51:30.422 --> 51:32.340
- Okay.
- (ringing continues)

51:32.424 --> 51:35.093
- Give my regards to the Swiss.
- (woman laughs)

51:35.177 --> 51:37.929
(rings)

51:39.765 --> 51:41.099
Hello.

51:41.183 --> 51:43.602
I have flames on my car.

51:43.685 --> 51:45.771
I have flames on my car!

51:45.854 --> 51:48.940
Shel, you're very excited.
I don't know what you're saying.

51:50.525 --> 51:52.027
Who?

51:53.195 --> 51:54.696
Holy Christ!

51:55.781 --> 51:57.449
They chased you?

51:58.700 --> 52:02.329
Uh, Shel, I don't understand
what you're saying about these flames.

52:02.412 --> 52:03.663
No.

52:03.747 --> 52:06.041
No, don't go home
under any circumstance.

52:06.124 --> 52:09.211
If it's really the treasury,
you'll get arrested. Definitely.

52:09.294 --> 52:13.507
Well, what do I do, Vince?
I tell you sincerely I do not want to go to jail.

52:13.590 --> 52:15.050
I don't want to get arrested.

52:15.133 --> 52:19.638
Shel, what I would very much like
for you to do the minute you hang up

52:19.721 --> 52:24.142
is drive like a bat out of hell
down to McGraw Airfield in New Jersey.

52:24.226 --> 52:27.229
It's near Lodi off Route 46.

52:27.312 --> 52:29.648
- I'll be waiting.
- Airfield?

52:29.731 --> 52:31.274
You're going where?

52:31.358 --> 52:33.318
Scranton, Pennsylvania? What for?

52:33.401 --> 52:36.321
I'll be gone a couple of hours
if you want to join me.

52:36.404 --> 52:38.657
Yeah, but what about
the Treasury Department?

52:38.740 --> 52:42.160
Don't tell me not to get excited!
They're chasing me all over New Jersey!

52:42.244 --> 52:43.870
Shel, you come with me to Scranton.

52:43.954 --> 52:47.666
By the time you get back, this thing
will be resolved. Take my word for it.

52:47.749 --> 52:49.876
JEAN: The hamburgers are getting cold!

52:50.752 --> 52:52.963
Shel, the end is in sight, I assure you.

52:53.046 --> 52:54.840
Now, take off.

52:54.923 --> 52:57.551
McGraw Airfield, Route 46.

52:58.552 --> 53:01.346
There are signs. Just follow 'em.

53:01.429 --> 53:04.683
Right. Now come on, let's get goin'.

53:15.819 --> 53:18.446
(speaking Cantonese)

53:29.457 --> 53:32.127
(chattering in Cantonese)

53:34.963 --> 53:37.090
(chattering continues)

53:39.718 --> 53:41.386
Oh, that's wrong.

53:41.469 --> 53:43.221
(Cantonese)

53:43.305 --> 53:44.806
Ah.

53:46.391 --> 53:47.893
(engine starts)

53:51.479 --> 53:53.356
COPILOT: Uh-oh!

53:53.440 --> 53:55.817
(Vince, copilot chattering in Cantonese)

53:57.986 --> 53:59.446
VINCE: I got it now.

53:59.529 --> 54:01.239
Okay.

54:01.323 --> 54:02.824
Here we go.

54:25.055 --> 54:29.059
(speaking Cantonese)

54:41.863 --> 54:43.365
(inhaling, exhaling)

54:43.448 --> 54:45.367
(Cantonese continues)

54:52.123 --> 54:53.625
(continues)

55:04.844 --> 55:06.346
(blowing)

55:09.265 --> 55:11.309
(speaking Cantonese)
Mae West.

55:11.393 --> 55:13.561
(Cantonese continues)

55:34.666 --> 55:36.751
(speaks Cantonese)

55:36.835 --> 55:39.379
Ah. (Cantonese)

55:59.357 --> 56:00.859
The ocean?

56:00.942 --> 56:03.278
It's over the ocean
to Scranton, Pennsylvania?

56:04.571 --> 56:06.531
(Cantonese)

56:06.614 --> 56:09.242
- Why are we flying over the ocean?
- Shel.

56:09.325 --> 56:11.745
Uh, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

56:11.828 --> 56:14.581
There's been a slight change
in our flight plan.

56:14.664 --> 56:17.542
- We're not going to Scranton, Pennsylvania?
- We are going to Scranton, Pennsylvania.

56:17.625 --> 56:20.045
But we want to make a quick stop
somewhere else first.

56:20.128 --> 56:21.963
Where? Where do we have to stop?

56:22.797 --> 56:24.799
- Tijada.
- What's Tijada?

56:24.883 --> 56:27.635
It's a tiny island.
It's just south of Honduras.

56:29.095 --> 56:30.472
Honduras?

56:30.555 --> 56:33.933
That's right.
I think you'll find it quite fascinating.

56:42.817 --> 56:44.778
(Vince speaks Cantonese)

56:48.114 --> 56:50.116
(shouts)

56:51.659 --> 56:53.995
Okeydoke.

57:09.344 --> 57:13.014
♪♪ (humming)

57:15.558 --> 57:18.394
Oh. (Cantonese)

57:19.020 --> 57:21.356
Fettuccine Szechuan.
(Cantonese continues)

57:21.439 --> 57:22.941
- Very lovely.
- Billy.

57:23.817 --> 57:26.653
Uh, Billy. (Cantonese)

57:26.736 --> 57:28.238
BILLY: Oh.

57:29.823 --> 57:32.283
Isn't he a sweetheart?

57:32.367 --> 57:35.703
You know, if Chiang Kai-shek had ever
made it back to the mainland,

57:35.787 --> 57:39.124
Billy and Bing would have been
co-anchormen on the evening news in China.

57:39.207 --> 57:41.376
That's how beloved they were.

57:42.418 --> 57:44.712
You're furious at me, right?

57:46.256 --> 57:49.717
The amazing thing is how grateful
you're gonna be to me

57:49.801 --> 57:51.803
when this is all over.

57:51.886 --> 57:54.889
I'm very serious.
From here on in, it's strictly routine.

57:54.973 --> 57:57.392
We're out of the country.
We're home free.

57:57.475 --> 58:01.020
From here on in, all that happens ‒
Shelly, you interested in this?

58:02.605 --> 58:07.819
All that happens is that we're met at the airport
by Senator Jesus Braunschweiger.

58:07.902 --> 58:10.989
He's a corrupt member
of the Tijadian legislature.

58:11.072 --> 58:12.991
He checks out the engraving.

58:13.074 --> 58:17.203
We go to the hotel, we wash up.
We have a couple of beers.

58:17.287 --> 58:19.747
Late in the afternoon,
we go see General Garcia.

58:19.831 --> 58:21.833
He's the head
of the Latin American syndicate.

58:21.916 --> 58:24.043
We hand him the engravings.

58:24.127 --> 58:28.173
He hands us 20 million bucks.
Bingo, we got him red-handed.

58:28.256 --> 58:30.633
Then what happens,
another little shoot-out?

58:30.717 --> 58:33.344
Shoot-out? No.

58:33.428 --> 58:36.431
(chuckling)
You've seen too many movies, Shel.

59:36.366 --> 59:38.534
(speaking Spanish)

59:50.004 --> 59:52.340
(speaking Cantonese)

59:55.343 --> 59:57.095
(speaking Cantonese)

01:00:04.102 --> 01:00:05.687
What he said.

01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:09.524
Jesus!

01:00:10.108 --> 01:00:11.109
Vince!

01:00:12.235 --> 01:00:14.404
- This guy's a crook?
- They're all crooks down here.

01:00:14.487 --> 01:00:16.698
At least this one
don't make any bones about it.

01:00:16.781 --> 01:00:19.117
- Welcome to Tijada!
- (gunshot)

01:00:21.744 --> 01:00:23.746
- (gunshot)
- Hit the deck!

01:00:25.707 --> 01:00:27.333
Is he dead?

01:00:27.417 --> 01:00:30.461
If he's alive, he's putting on
a hell of an act, ain't he?

01:00:30.545 --> 01:00:32.463
- (gunshot)
- Roll over!

01:00:32.547 --> 01:00:34.048
(gunshot)

01:00:38.011 --> 01:00:39.637
They're taking off without us!

01:00:39.721 --> 01:00:42.390
- That's standard procedure.
- What?

01:00:42.473 --> 01:00:45.351
- We gotta make a run for his car.
- We'll never make it.

01:00:45.435 --> 01:00:48.438
We'll never make it lying here,
that's for goddamn sure. You ready?

01:00:48.521 --> 01:00:49.814
- No.
- (gunshot)

01:00:49.897 --> 01:00:52.150
- Now I'm ready.
- (gunshot)

01:00:52.233 --> 01:00:54.652
- Serpentine!
- What?

01:00:54.736 --> 01:00:57.322
- Serpentine!
- (gunfire continues)

01:00:57.405 --> 01:00:59.032
(bullet ricochets)

01:00:59.115 --> 01:01:00.616
Serpentine!

01:01:03.494 --> 01:01:04.996
Jump!

01:01:12.587 --> 01:01:14.464
(gunfire continues)

01:01:15.923 --> 01:01:18.593
- Where the hell are the keys?
- Are you kidding me?

01:01:18.676 --> 01:01:20.720
Out of the car.

01:01:23.097 --> 01:01:25.099
- They must be in his pocket.
- I'll get 'em.

01:01:25.183 --> 01:01:26.684
No! I'll get 'em.

01:01:26.768 --> 01:01:28.895
I'd rather die running
than be left here alone.

01:01:28.978 --> 01:01:30.980
Shel, you don't know what you're saying.

01:01:31.064 --> 01:01:32.523
I can't take it anymore.

01:01:32.607 --> 01:01:37.028
The idea of you out there dead and me all alone
back here with the smoke and the bullets.

01:01:37.111 --> 01:01:39.197
- I can't take it.
- Are you ‒ Are you serious?

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:42.200
- I can't stay here.
- Okay, but remember, serpentine!

01:01:42.283 --> 01:01:44.077
- Absolutely.
- What a guy.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.120
(gunfire continues)

01:01:51.376 --> 01:01:53.544
You're dead, right?

01:01:53.628 --> 01:01:56.047
- Good.
- (gunshot)

01:01:57.632 --> 01:01:59.967
(shouting in Spanish)

01:02:04.305 --> 01:02:06.641
Serpentine, Shel. Serpentine!

01:02:26.494 --> 01:02:28.246
(Spanish)

01:02:30.039 --> 01:02:32.500
Ha! Ha!

01:02:37.630 --> 01:02:39.006
(Spanish)

01:02:42.343 --> 01:02:44.011
<i>¡Basta! Basta, basta.</i>

01:02:44.095 --> 01:02:45.680
(speaks Spanish)

01:02:51.352 --> 01:02:53.146
VINCE: Got a little time now, Shel.

01:02:53.229 --> 01:02:55.815
Why don't you lie down,
grab yourself a nap?

01:02:55.898 --> 01:02:59.068
- (dog barking)
- (donkey braying)

01:03:01.487 --> 01:03:03.614
VINCE: Well, you can imagine
how I felt, General,

01:03:03.698 --> 01:03:06.534
seeing him dead
on the runway like that.

01:03:06.617 --> 01:03:10.163
No, I said, "Hello, Jesus,"
and he said, "Hello, Vince."

01:03:10.246 --> 01:03:12.248
It came as a complete surprise.

01:03:13.875 --> 01:03:16.043
I agree.
It must have been anarchists.

01:03:17.211 --> 01:03:18.629
Hookers?

01:03:18.713 --> 01:03:20.631
No, that's very kind of you, General,

01:03:20.715 --> 01:03:23.176
but we're really anxious
to wrap this up and get home.

01:03:23.259 --> 01:03:25.636
- Out, out! Get out! Out!
- (clucking)

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.180
VINCE: Shel.

01:03:27.263 --> 01:03:30.057
As quickly as possible, General.

01:03:30.141 --> 01:03:33.269
No, we'll take a cab.
We had a little trouble with the car.

01:03:33.352 --> 01:03:36.731
The windows weren't functioning properly.
Isn't it always the case?

01:03:36.814 --> 01:03:39.400
Right. Shel, where are you going, Shel?

01:03:39.484 --> 01:03:41.152
Lobby. Look at a magazine.

01:03:41.235 --> 01:03:43.488
All right. Stay close.
We'll be leaving soon.

01:03:43.571 --> 01:03:45.156
Oh, good.

01:03:45.907 --> 01:03:48.534
Now, exactly where
are you located, General?

01:03:49.744 --> 01:03:53.664
501 United Fruit Boulevard,

01:03:53.748 --> 01:03:56.417
via the General Garcia toll bridge.

01:03:56.501 --> 01:03:57.960
Fine.

01:03:58.044 --> 01:04:00.421
It's a very fitting monument to you, sir.

01:04:01.422 --> 01:04:04.091
Yes, better than a statue.

01:04:04.175 --> 01:04:06.385
Now, do you have the money?

01:04:06.469 --> 01:04:08.346
Right.

01:04:08.429 --> 01:04:10.681
Uh, no, General. It's ‒

01:04:10.765 --> 01:04:13.601
It's 10 million in an attaché case.

01:04:14.644 --> 01:04:16.854
Attaché.

01:04:16.938 --> 01:04:21.526
And 10 million wrapped in two
small packages of five million each.

01:04:22.693 --> 01:04:24.195
Perfect.

01:04:24.278 --> 01:04:26.447
No, the Treasury Department
never knew what hit 'em.

01:04:42.922 --> 01:04:45.424
(speaking Spanish)

01:04:50.137 --> 01:04:51.639
(dog yapping)

01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:17.540
Operator, uh, <i>habla usted inglés?</i>

01:05:18.499 --> 01:05:20.793
Good. I need
the American Embassy, please.

01:05:20.876 --> 01:05:22.670
It's urgent. I'm in great danger.

01:05:26.674 --> 01:05:28.342
(horn honks)

01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:30.761
(intercom buzzes)

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:34.432
Barry Lutz, Intelligence.
Can I help you?

01:05:34.515 --> 01:05:37.184
Mr. Lutz, I may sound
a little bit incoherent,

01:05:37.268 --> 01:05:40.146
but when you hear my situation,
I think you'll understand why.

01:05:40.229 --> 01:05:43.316
My name is Kornpett.
I'm a DDS in the greater New York area.

01:05:43.399 --> 01:05:45.276
I reside in New Jersey,

01:05:45.359 --> 01:05:47.778
and I'm a normal and patriotic
American citizen.

01:05:47.862 --> 01:05:50.740
Now, I'm in Tijada right now.
I'm in Tijada, yes.

01:05:50.823 --> 01:05:53.200
I'm here with a man
who works for the CIA.

01:05:53.284 --> 01:05:56.203
And the thing is, he's got me involved
in some scheme of his

01:05:56.287 --> 01:05:58.122
concerning a general down here.

01:05:58.205 --> 01:06:01.834
Well, my life has been in almost
constant jeopardy for 24 hours now.

01:06:01.917 --> 01:06:05.046
I keep getting shot at,
and I-I can't handle it anymore.

01:06:10.593 --> 01:06:12.928
His name is Vince Ricardo.

01:06:13.929 --> 01:06:16.932
- What are you laughing about?
- (chuckling)

01:06:17.016 --> 01:06:21.479
You're with Vince Ricardo?
How much insurance do you carry?

01:06:21.562 --> 01:06:23.397
Oh, Christ, no.

01:06:23.481 --> 01:06:25.107
No, not anymore.

01:06:25.191 --> 01:06:28.903
He was thrown out of the agency
late last year on a mental.

01:06:28.986 --> 01:06:31.781
A mental. You heard me right.

01:06:31.864 --> 01:06:33.949
He's a wild man, that's why.

01:06:34.033 --> 01:06:36.911
He'd go into very dangerous situations
without any rhyme or reason

01:06:36.994 --> 01:06:38.496
and just improvise, you know?

01:06:38.579 --> 01:06:40.456
Totally ass-backwards.

01:06:40.539 --> 01:06:44.627
The worst thing was that we lost a half dozen
good men who had teamed with him.

01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:47.672
Horrible, gruesome deaths too.

01:06:47.755 --> 01:06:49.215
Yeah, real nightmare.

01:06:49.298 --> 01:06:51.342
And you're with him right now,
is that right?

01:06:51.425 --> 01:06:53.177
Yeah, he's got these engravings.

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:55.971
He says he's trying to crack
this international currency thing.

01:06:56.055 --> 01:06:58.432
I don't know, it's not my kind of ‒

01:06:58.516 --> 01:07:01.268
No, we're just related
by a pending marriage.

01:07:01.352 --> 01:07:04.438
His son is marrying my daughter Sunday.

01:07:04.522 --> 01:07:05.940
Thank you.

01:07:06.691 --> 01:07:08.693
(chicken clucking)

01:07:08.776 --> 01:07:10.986
Yeah, he's a little strange,
but I don't know,

01:07:11.070 --> 01:07:13.072
there's also something lovable
about the guy.

01:07:13.155 --> 01:07:16.951
Sure, he's lovable,
but he's completely out of his mind.

01:07:17.034 --> 01:07:19.870
I could tell you stories.

01:07:19.954 --> 01:07:21.455
Listen, listen.

01:07:21.539 --> 01:07:24.709
Do yourself, do your family,
do me a favor.

01:07:24.792 --> 01:07:27.169
Just stay the hell away from him.

01:07:27.253 --> 01:07:30.297
Yeah. Sure.
Glad to be of service.

01:07:37.722 --> 01:07:39.390
I thought you were getting a magazine.

01:07:39.473 --> 01:07:42.226
Well, all they had was <i>Hustler</i> in Spanish.

01:07:42.309 --> 01:07:44.395
"El Hustlero."

01:07:44.478 --> 01:07:47.231
- You made a call.
- Yes, I did.

01:07:47.314 --> 01:07:49.817
- You called the agency?
- Yes, I did.

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:51.402
And what did they say?

01:07:51.485 --> 01:07:54.238
They said you were kicked out
of the agency because you were

01:07:54.321 --> 01:07:55.906
A: dangerous and B: crazy.

01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:59.410
- They really said that?
- Oh, yes.

01:08:01.412 --> 01:08:03.664
(hooting, laughing)

01:08:05.499 --> 01:08:08.169
You don't have a heart condition
or anything, do you, Shel?

01:08:09.378 --> 01:08:11.088
- Get off of me.
- Listen to me.

01:08:11.172 --> 01:08:13.132
You're a total stranger.
You called the agency.

01:08:13.215 --> 01:08:16.676
- What do you think they're going to tell you?
- I don't know and I don't care.

01:08:16.761 --> 01:08:19.930
You could be a foreign agent,
so they tell you that I'm washed up,

01:08:20.014 --> 01:08:21.765
I'm out of the business, I'm nuts.

01:08:21.849 --> 01:08:24.100
- Are you going to get off me?
- Not yet.

01:08:24.185 --> 01:08:27.270
They did the hundred percent correct thing
telling you that I was nuts.

01:08:27.354 --> 01:08:30.941
Do you understand that
it was simply a fabrication?

01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:34.444
- If I say yes, will you get off me?
- If it's a sincere yes.

01:08:34.528 --> 01:08:36.071
Then the answer is yes.

01:08:36.154 --> 01:08:39.283
I believe it was simply a fabrication
to get me off the trail.

01:08:39.366 --> 01:08:41.618
I knew you'd understand.

01:08:46.081 --> 01:08:47.416
- Let's go.
- No way.

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:49.960
- What's this "no way"?
- No way is no way.

01:08:50.044 --> 01:08:52.462
I'm off the case here.
I'm done with this nonsense.

01:08:52.546 --> 01:08:55.256
Sheldon, now, I just explained to you
it was a fabricated ‒

01:08:55.341 --> 01:08:58.636
No, you see, it makes no difference
if you're sane or if you're crazy

01:08:58.719 --> 01:09:01.095
or if you're with the agency
or not with the agency.

01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:03.808
It has no bearing on my life.
I hate all of this.

01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:07.144
- From here on in, it's cut and dry.
- It's not cut, and it's not dry.

01:09:07.228 --> 01:09:10.564
It is. We go to the general.
Drop off the engravings.

01:09:11.524 --> 01:09:12.817
Sheldon.

01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:15.903
Vince, if it's so cut and dry,
you don't need me, right?

01:09:15.986 --> 01:09:18.488
Go in peace.
I'll take a commercial flight home.

01:09:18.572 --> 01:09:21.992
If the Treasury Department is waiting for me,
I'll tell them what little I know.

01:09:22.076 --> 01:09:24.286
Chances are they'll probably
just feel sorry for me.

01:09:24.370 --> 01:09:27.247
But I will not be shot at any longer.
Is that clear?

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:30.000
Okay. Really.

01:09:30.084 --> 01:09:32.461
I can understand
a person with your background,

01:09:32.545 --> 01:09:34.212
it's difficult, it's not easy.

01:09:34.296 --> 01:09:36.674
If you like,
I'll wait here at the hotel for you.

01:09:36.756 --> 01:09:38.843
But no more running, no more shooting.

01:09:38.926 --> 01:09:40.845
From here on in, I'm a bystander.

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:44.473
Okay.

01:09:44.557 --> 01:09:46.517
When you're right, you're right.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:49.019
Just don't go home without me.
Huh, Shel?

01:09:49.103 --> 01:09:51.689
Geez, I couldn't take that kind of rejection.

01:09:51.772 --> 01:09:55.192
We'll go home with Billy and Bing.
Have a few laughs, okay?

01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:58.696
- You gonna be long?
- I'll be back within an hour.

01:09:58.779 --> 01:10:00.281
Okay.

01:10:00.364 --> 01:10:03.367
That's kind of you, Shel.
I really appreciate that.

01:10:10.416 --> 01:10:12.084
- Taxi, señor?
<i>- Sí.</i>

01:10:12.167 --> 01:10:14.128
501 United Fruit Boulevard.

01:10:14.211 --> 01:10:15.713
Pronto.

01:10:27.224 --> 01:10:28.726
Oh, God!

01:10:30.561 --> 01:10:31.896
I can't.

01:10:34.023 --> 01:10:36.025
Hey!

01:10:36.108 --> 01:10:37.610
Vince!

01:10:42.573 --> 01:10:45.034
Jesus Christ. What the hell was that?

01:10:45.117 --> 01:10:46.452
(Spanish)

01:10:50.456 --> 01:10:52.499
<i>Imposible.</i>

01:10:55.461 --> 01:10:57.171
(whimpers)

01:10:57.254 --> 01:10:59.214
(shouting in Spanish)

01:11:01.634 --> 01:11:03.761
(screaming)

01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:07.097
(horns honking)

01:11:11.185 --> 01:11:12.853
(Spanish continues)

01:11:17.024 --> 01:11:19.151
- Vince!
- Shelly!

01:11:19.234 --> 01:11:21.487
Stop the car. It's Sheldon.

01:11:21.570 --> 01:11:24.198
It's me up here, Vince.

01:11:24.281 --> 01:11:26.617
- Can you stop the car?
- Maybe you're right, Sheldon.

01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:28.994
- Vince?
- Maybe you're right.

01:11:29.703 --> 01:11:30.871
Oh, boy.

01:11:32.373 --> 01:11:33.916
(horn honks)

01:11:33.999 --> 01:11:36.669
Nice work, Sheldon. Piece of cake.

01:11:38.337 --> 01:11:40.547
Piece of cake, Sheldon.

01:11:40.631 --> 01:11:43.133
- Vince, stop the car!
- I'm trying.

01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:57.106
- (groans)
- You okay?

01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:59.108
Yeah, I think so.

01:11:59.191 --> 01:12:01.694
You can't blame me for this.
You volunteered.

01:12:01.777 --> 01:12:04.905
- (groans)
- And a wonderful gesture it was.

01:12:06.031 --> 01:12:08.826
(shouting in Spanish)

01:12:09.743 --> 01:12:12.162
- (bystanders shouting)
- VINCE: Let's go.

01:12:12.246 --> 01:12:15.499
Stay low, Sheldon. Stay low.

01:12:17.251 --> 01:12:18.919
- (gunfire continues)
- (grunting)

01:12:20.421 --> 01:12:24.341
Sheldon, come here.
Come here, Sheldon. Come on.

01:12:24.425 --> 01:12:27.011
Grab him by his shoulders, Shel.
And pull.

01:12:27.094 --> 01:12:29.346
- All right.
- Stay down, Shel. Stay down.

01:12:31.015 --> 01:12:33.183
Stay low, Sheldon.

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:48.032
What a guy.

01:12:48.115 --> 01:12:49.616
(woman screaming)

01:12:55.622 --> 01:12:58.625
- Get in the cab, Shel.
- (glass shattering)

01:13:07.134 --> 01:13:09.428
Shel? In the cab, Shel.

01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:14.808
- That was a magnificent thing you did.
- It was instinct. I went crazy.

01:13:14.892 --> 01:13:16.393
It was pure heroism.

01:13:16.477 --> 01:13:19.605
And don't think I don't know
how deeply you feel about me, Shel.

01:13:19.688 --> 01:13:21.398
It gives me such a warm feeling.

01:13:28.572 --> 01:13:31.200
Okay, hang on.
This is gonna be a little rough.

01:13:49.927 --> 01:13:52.930
Next time we're in Tijada, Shel,
don't let me forget.

01:13:53.013 --> 01:13:56.183
They make a chicken sandwich here.
They serve it on a hard roll.

01:13:56.266 --> 01:14:00.062
They heat it up with orange juice.
You know, <i>grande,</i> a big one.

01:14:00.145 --> 01:14:01.939
Or pineapple juice.

01:14:02.022 --> 01:14:04.316
And coffee. Do you take coffee, Shel?

01:14:04.399 --> 01:14:07.236
Espresso with that beautiful foam.

01:14:07.319 --> 01:14:08.821
Oh, Jesus, pigs.

01:14:09.571 --> 01:14:12.282
(squealing)

01:14:13.408 --> 01:14:15.244
<i>(pig squealing)</i>

01:14:15.327 --> 01:14:17.704
Don't they squeal when they die?

01:14:17.788 --> 01:14:19.957
No, the pig is alive, Shel.

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.708
You know, I'm such a great driver,

01:14:21.792 --> 01:14:24.336
it's incomprehensible
that they took my license away.

01:14:25.379 --> 01:14:27.840
(shouting in Spanish)

01:14:37.891 --> 01:14:39.893
(horn honking)

01:15:02.708 --> 01:15:04.543
Okay.

01:15:04.626 --> 01:15:06.253
What are you doing?

01:15:09.548 --> 01:15:11.758
(horn honking)

01:15:12.342 --> 01:15:15.387
(tires squealing)

01:15:22.269 --> 01:15:23.687
(shouting in Spanish)

01:15:32.696 --> 01:15:33.947
Again?

01:15:59.431 --> 01:16:01.433
(horn honking)

01:16:02.309 --> 01:16:05.437
(gunfire)

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:08.106
Okay.

01:16:08.649 --> 01:16:12.986
- (tires squeal)
- (horn honking)

01:16:25.415 --> 01:16:28.418
SHELDON: Holy shit!

01:16:30.545 --> 01:16:34.174
Now that was a little close, I admit it.
I cut it a little fine.

01:16:34.258 --> 01:16:37.302
(shouting in Spanish)

01:16:39.554 --> 01:16:42.099
VINCE: Coming through. Emergency.

01:16:42.182 --> 01:16:44.101
Out of the way, please. Emergency.

01:16:44.184 --> 01:16:47.187
- Jesus Christ! Oh, my God!
- Out of the way. Police emergency!

01:16:47.271 --> 01:16:48.689
Coming through!

01:16:55.404 --> 01:16:57.906
(horn honking)

01:17:15.215 --> 01:17:19.886
Okay. Sometimes I'm so smart
I scare myself.

01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:29.896
(shouts in Spanish)

01:17:35.319 --> 01:17:37.904
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

01:17:37.988 --> 01:17:42.075
I gotta give you credit, Vince.
You son of a gun, ya!

01:17:42.159 --> 01:17:44.703
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:18:11.688 --> 01:18:13.857
- What's the story on this guy?
- The general?

01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:16.526
- Yeah.
- Very interesting gentleman.

01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:19.363
Two things, Shel.
Don't say anything about his scar.

01:18:19.446 --> 01:18:21.365
His scar?
What do you mean? What scar?

01:18:21.448 --> 01:18:24.368
You'll see it, but don't see it.
You follow my drift?

01:18:24.451 --> 01:18:27.662
The other thing, be sure
to compliment his art collection.

01:18:29.414 --> 01:18:32.209
Vince, my good friend.

01:18:32.292 --> 01:18:34.127
- My general.
- (laughing)

01:18:34.211 --> 01:18:36.213
- Hmm.
- A "Z"?

01:18:36.296 --> 01:18:38.090
- What?
- A "Z"?

01:18:38.173 --> 01:18:41.134
Uh, General, I'd like you
to meet Dr. Sheldon Kornpett.

01:18:41.218 --> 01:18:45.055
Uh, Sheldon has provided invaluable
assistance to the success of this mission.

01:18:45.138 --> 01:18:47.391
Really? Dr. Kornpett.

01:18:47.474 --> 01:18:49.935
Please, gentlemen, enter.

01:18:50.811 --> 01:18:52.145
Oh!

01:18:52.229 --> 01:18:54.272
(chuckles)

01:18:54.356 --> 01:18:56.525
You noticed my friend, eh?

01:18:56.608 --> 01:18:58.902
This is Señor Pepe.

01:18:58.985 --> 01:19:00.445
(high-pitched voice)
Hello.

01:19:00.529 --> 01:19:03.448
Señor Pepe, do you like this man?

01:19:03.532 --> 01:19:06.159
<i>Oh, sí, sí</i>. Very much.

01:19:06.243 --> 01:19:09.329
Uh, shall we invite these men to sit down?

01:19:09.413 --> 01:19:11.289
<i>Oh, sí, sí. Sí, sí.</i>

01:19:12.082 --> 01:19:16.753
Señor Pepe, would you like
to give this man a kiss?

01:19:16.837 --> 01:19:20.465
Oh! <i>Sí, sí, sí.</i>

01:19:20.549 --> 01:19:22.300
(loud kiss)
He's nice?

01:19:22.384 --> 01:19:23.927
(high-pitched voice)
Very nice.

01:19:24.010 --> 01:19:27.264
(kissing) He's nice?
(high-pitched voice) He's nice.

01:19:27.347 --> 01:19:29.599
He very handsome.
(kissing)

01:19:29.683 --> 01:19:32.102
All right, all right, that's enough.

01:19:32.185 --> 01:19:35.397
General, that's a hell of an act.
You're a very gifted man.

01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:36.982
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

01:19:38.024 --> 01:19:39.651
We go in.

01:19:39.734 --> 01:19:43.113
- Jesus, he's a raving fruitcake.
- Don't underestimate him.

01:19:43.196 --> 01:19:44.656
- The art.
- The art.

01:19:44.739 --> 01:19:48.285
General, your art collection
never fails to take my breath away.

01:19:48.368 --> 01:19:50.412
Oh, the toreador's wonderful.

01:19:50.495 --> 01:19:52.789
Ah, I paid $50,000 for this.

01:19:52.873 --> 01:19:55.083
- Jesus, what a schmuck.
- Shut up.

01:19:55.167 --> 01:20:00.005
This, uh ‒ This tiger, I recently
purchased for only 25,000,

01:20:00.088 --> 01:20:02.466
but I believe it is one of his best.

01:20:02.549 --> 01:20:04.634
Note the plasticity,

01:20:04.718 --> 01:20:07.053
the almost Renaissance use
of the perspective.

01:20:07.137 --> 01:20:10.265
- Yes, he got the stripes almost perfectly.
- That's right, Shelly.

01:20:10.348 --> 01:20:13.935
Notice the whiskers. My God, you could
almost reach out and touch 'em.

01:20:14.019 --> 01:20:16.980
That's the tip-off
to a great work of art.

01:20:17.063 --> 01:20:19.316
Not everybody appreciates genius.

01:20:19.399 --> 01:20:22.986
- There are a lot of boors in the world.
- Ah, you can say that twice.

01:20:23.069 --> 01:20:26.656
I commissioned this great man
to do a new flag for this country.

01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:29.117
And it incites screaming.

01:20:29.201 --> 01:20:32.204
Ah, I show you, hmm?

01:20:40.629 --> 01:20:43.590
- VINCE: Ah.
- Now, this is a flag.

01:20:43.673 --> 01:20:47.219
Ah, take your breath away.
Shel, can you believe that?

01:20:47.302 --> 01:20:49.804
General, it's <i>magnífico.</i>

01:20:49.888 --> 01:20:51.973
And is that Mrs. General there?

01:20:52.057 --> 01:20:53.517
Oh.

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:54.935
No, no.

01:20:55.018 --> 01:20:58.063
This is a girl from the village.
This is a prostitute.

01:20:59.272 --> 01:21:01.024
If it was not for the church,

01:21:01.107 --> 01:21:04.528
this flag would already today
be flying at the UN.

01:21:04.611 --> 01:21:07.864
But no, they stand in the way.
They stand in the way!

01:21:07.948 --> 01:21:09.324
- See? See?
- Ah, General.

01:21:09.407 --> 01:21:12.452
You know, the world is full of reactionaries.
People with small minds.

01:21:12.536 --> 01:21:15.163
(high-pitched voice, Spanish)
(normal voice) What's that? You are thirsty?

01:21:15.247 --> 01:21:17.415
<i>Sí</i>. (speaks Spanish)

01:21:17.499 --> 01:21:21.086
- (chuckles)
- Ah, he wants ‒ he wants cold water, Shel.

01:21:21.169 --> 01:21:23.296
That's what that means.

01:21:26.049 --> 01:21:29.594
All right?
<i>Sí, sí. Sí, sí. Gracias.</i>

01:21:33.723 --> 01:21:35.225
Uh, General?

01:21:36.518 --> 01:21:38.937
<i>Sí</i>. Down to business.

01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:41.523
That's right, sir.
Do you have the money?

01:21:41.606 --> 01:21:42.941
(bell rings)

01:21:48.989 --> 01:21:51.741
These are the best security men
in the world.

01:21:51.825 --> 01:21:54.578
They used to work
for JCPenney in Detroit.

01:21:54.661 --> 01:21:57.581
You know, if I'm not mistaken,
I once bought a comb there.

01:21:57.664 --> 01:21:59.749
- Hmm?
- As a matter of fact, I did, Shel.

01:21:59.833 --> 01:22:01.334
Little pocket comb.

01:22:09.467 --> 01:22:11.720
Ten million, <i>exactamente.</i>

01:22:11.803 --> 01:22:14.222
And the other 10?

01:22:14.306 --> 01:22:16.182
These are small enough?

01:22:16.266 --> 01:22:18.560
They're fine. Perfect.

01:22:19.436 --> 01:22:21.354
- Sheldon?
- What's that?

01:22:21.438 --> 01:22:23.732
Five million bucks.
Just hang on to it.

01:22:23.815 --> 01:22:25.692
Five million dollars?

01:22:25.775 --> 01:22:30.822
Uh, General, it gives me
great pleasure to present ‒

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.501
Oh.

01:22:44.085 --> 01:22:45.587
Beautiful.

01:22:45.670 --> 01:22:48.673
Made by Uncle Sam
with his own greedy little fingers.

01:22:48.757 --> 01:22:51.384
Oh, <i>fantástico.</i>

01:23:01.436 --> 01:23:04.147
- Would you like to see?
- Oh, love to, General.

01:23:04.230 --> 01:23:07.400
Shel, you too.
This is extremely educational.

01:23:09.235 --> 01:23:11.279
- When are you gonna arrest this guy?
- Relax.

01:23:11.363 --> 01:23:13.823
- Nobody is arresting nobody.
- Why not?

01:23:13.907 --> 01:23:16.576
Just go with the flow, Shel.
Just go with the flow.

01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:18.411
What flow? There isn't any flow.

01:23:19.788 --> 01:23:22.123
These are engravings
from all over the world.

01:23:22.207 --> 01:23:25.710
VINCE: This is unbelievable.
General, I'm very impressed.

01:23:25.794 --> 01:23:27.754
Heat it up. We are ready.

01:23:27.837 --> 01:23:30.507
- How much of this you gonna run off?
- 300 billion.

01:23:30.590 --> 01:23:32.509
Oh, that'll do it.
That's more than enough.

01:23:32.592 --> 01:23:34.344
- Sounds like plenty.
- It's a lot, huh?

01:23:34.427 --> 01:23:36.805
It will bring the Western punks
to their knees.

01:23:36.888 --> 01:23:38.765
Me and my good American friends.

01:23:38.848 --> 01:23:42.102
- It's a wonderful thing, General.
- I don't know when I've felt so proud.

01:23:42.185 --> 01:23:47.190
In 72 hours, the monetary system of the world
will collapse like a wet taco.

01:23:47.273 --> 01:23:49.109
A very fine analogy, sir.

01:23:49.192 --> 01:23:51.194
Blood will run in the streets of Zurich.

01:23:51.277 --> 01:23:54.406
German bankers will just
throw themselves under the trolley.

01:23:54.489 --> 01:23:56.574
Widows and orphans
will be left penniless.

01:23:56.658 --> 01:23:58.451
- Sounds good to me.
- There will be panic.

01:23:58.535 --> 01:24:02.038
There will be looting,
rioting in the streets and suicides.

01:24:02.122 --> 01:24:03.373
Fabulous.

01:24:03.456 --> 01:24:07.001
And you,
my dear, sweet American friends,

01:24:08.628 --> 01:24:10.964
you were here right at the start.

01:24:12.841 --> 01:24:14.342
Come.

01:24:54.966 --> 01:24:57.177
The <i>pollo</i> must be marinated
for six weeks.

01:24:57.260 --> 01:25:00.930
Well, it's very, very good.
You don't get this kind of stuff in New York.

01:25:01.014 --> 01:25:03.933
Vince, you're not hungry?

01:25:04.017 --> 01:25:06.478

No, no. He no like the food.

01:25:14.944 --> 01:25:18.531
No, no, the food is terrific.
It's just that my stomach is a little upset.

01:25:18.615 --> 01:25:21.159

from all marinated birds.

I gotta say I'm having a very good time.

01:25:56.027 --> 01:25:59.113
This guy may be a dictator, but there's
something still very innocent about him.

01:25:59.197 --> 01:26:02.325
Oh, yes, extremely innocent.
You know, I think my hearing is shot.

Oh, General, how nice.

01:26:22.846 --> 01:26:25.014
To my wonderful American friends.

01:26:25.098 --> 01:26:27.642
- My brave American friends.
- (laughing)

01:26:27.725 --> 01:26:29.435
May I share something with you?

01:26:30.270 --> 01:26:32.272
I am a pacifist by nature

01:26:32.355 --> 01:26:36.192
with a deep, Quaker belief
in the sanctity of human life.

01:26:37.193 --> 01:26:39.863
I wish I had the choice but to kill you.

01:26:39.946 --> 01:26:41.906
What'd he say?

01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:45.076
- You heard right.
<i>- Vaya con Dios.</i>

01:26:46.911 --> 01:26:49.622
<i>¡Presenten armas!</i>

01:26:51.207 --> 01:26:53.459
Okay, what's our next move?

01:26:53.543 --> 01:26:56.045
Move? No more moves. This is it.

01:26:56.129 --> 01:26:59.716
- No kidding around. What do we do?
- This is it, Shel. That's all she wrote.

01:26:59.799 --> 01:27:02.093
- Come on, Vince. What's the plan?
- I'm wide open.

01:27:02.176 --> 01:27:04.387
- What do you got in mind?
- (snaps fingers)

01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:07.265
<i>¡Apunten!</i>

01:27:07.348 --> 01:27:09.517
- Can't we create some kind of diversion?
- Like what?

01:27:09.601 --> 01:27:12.395
How the hell do I know?
You're the expert. Think of something.

01:27:12.478 --> 01:27:14.564
- I'll give it a shot.
<i>- ¡Apunten!</i>

01:27:14.647 --> 01:27:16.399
- General?
<i>- ¿Sí?</i>

01:27:16.482 --> 01:27:18.735
May I interject for a moment, please?

01:27:18.818 --> 01:27:20.862
<i>- Sí.
- ¡Firmes!</i>

01:27:20.945 --> 01:27:22.322
General.

01:27:23.531 --> 01:27:25.867
Spare this man.

01:27:25.950 --> 01:27:28.745
This man, Sheldon Kornpett.

01:27:28.828 --> 01:27:30.747
Shelly, I call him.

01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:33.416
He's a great dentist from New York,

01:27:33.499 --> 01:27:37.337
a city in which,
as you probably know, General,

01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:39.964
there are thousands
of Spanish-speaking people

01:27:40.048 --> 01:27:44.260
who stand in dire need
of extensive bridgework.

01:27:44.344 --> 01:27:47.764
And this man's death, I'm afraid,

01:27:47.847 --> 01:27:52.101
would be a crushing blow
to whatever small hopes they might have

01:27:52.185 --> 01:27:55.355
for a healthier set of teeth and gums.

01:27:57.106 --> 01:28:00.026
(shouting) That was it?
The dental thing? I'm a dead man!

01:28:00.109 --> 01:28:03.279
But they will have
great memories of you.

01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:06.991
<i>¡Preparen armas!</i>

01:28:08.368 --> 01:28:11.287
This is it? My life is over.

01:28:11.371 --> 01:28:13.122
Forty-three years.

01:28:13.206 --> 01:28:16.834
I've only had four women,
two of them my wife.

01:28:16.918 --> 01:28:19.504
- Once before and once afterwards.
- General.

01:28:19.587 --> 01:28:21.965
Even in the army, I never fooled around.

01:28:22.048 --> 01:28:24.300
General, I'm not one
to pat myself on the back,

01:28:24.384 --> 01:28:27.011
but I could have told you
he was gonna blow sky high.

01:28:27.095 --> 01:28:29.764
- He's simply not equipped, General.
- My father, that son of a bitch.

01:28:29.847 --> 01:28:31.766
I never told him off.
And now he's dead.

01:28:31.849 --> 01:28:34.727
General, could we have a sedative
for Shel here?

01:28:34.811 --> 01:28:37.021
- This is not right.
- I have no drugs.

01:28:37.105 --> 01:28:39.232
- An aspirin then?
- I have no aspirins.

01:28:39.315 --> 01:28:41.567
- Only herbal teas.
- Fine, get the tea.

01:28:41.651 --> 01:28:45.780
- There is no time for tea.
- (Sheldon muttering)

01:28:45.863 --> 01:28:48.574
General, I insist on
at least a blindfold for Shel here.

01:28:48.658 --> 01:28:51.327
I have no blindfolds, señor.
This is a poor country, please.

01:28:51.411 --> 01:28:54.038
I really hate to be
a pain in the ass about this.

01:28:54.122 --> 01:28:56.749
- Don't care if I live or die!
- But the Geneva Convention stipulates ‒

01:28:56.833 --> 01:28:59.210
- I've always loved this country.
- that firing squad victims ‒

01:28:59.293 --> 01:29:01.671
and I'm afraid we fall into that category ‒

01:29:01.754 --> 01:29:04.882
are required to be given
the option of a blindfold.

01:29:04.966 --> 01:29:08.219
- Otherwise, you can be reported.
- Who is going to report me?

01:29:08.302 --> 01:29:11.431
Your ghost?
Is your ghost going to report me?

01:29:11.514 --> 01:29:14.017
- (muttering)
- (laughing)

01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:17.186
General, I insist on at least
a blindfold for Shel here.

01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:19.939
Come on, be a man!
Please be a man!

01:29:20.023 --> 01:29:22.692
I have to shoot you now
and go and do my business.

01:29:22.775 --> 01:29:24.485
Stand up straight, be a man.

01:29:24.569 --> 01:29:27.864
I hate to go through this thing
without at least the option of a blindfold.

01:29:27.947 --> 01:29:30.867
- Ho! Bandanas!
<i>- Gracias, señor.</i>

01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:34.120
<i>Sí, sí</i>. Hey, Vince,
you won't forget I did this, eh?

01:29:34.203 --> 01:29:37.123
- And we're supposed to have cigarettes.
- Cigarettes?

01:29:37.206 --> 01:29:39.584
SHELDON: If you know my heart,
as you say you do.

01:29:39.667 --> 01:29:41.836
But it's been simple negligence.
It hasn't been disbelief.

01:29:41.919 --> 01:29:44.547
<i>- Gracias.</i>
- Oh, oh, what was that?

01:29:44.630 --> 01:29:45.965
That was a cigarette!

01:29:46.049 --> 01:29:48.217
- I don't smoke. (laughing)
- This isn't lit, General.

01:29:48.301 --> 01:29:49.635
<i>¡Apunten!</i>

01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:51.929
(laughing loudly)

01:29:52.013 --> 01:29:53.514
- My cigarette ‒
- (gunfire)

01:29:53.598 --> 01:29:55.725
Ooh! Ooh! Am I shot? Am I shot?

01:29:55.808 --> 01:29:57.977
(gunfire continues)

01:30:01.064 --> 01:30:02.732
- Get down!
- What?

01:30:02.815 --> 01:30:04.817
- Shel, get down.
- I can't hear you.

01:30:04.901 --> 01:30:06.527
Can you get down?

01:30:06.611 --> 01:30:08.821
- Get down! Are you down?
- Yes!

01:30:09.697 --> 01:30:11.199

01:30:18.831 --> 01:30:20.792
- VINCE: Can you move?
- Yeah, I can try.

01:30:20.875 --> 01:30:22.376
- Are ya moving?
- Yeah.

01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:24.504
Keep moving.

01:30:31.677 --> 01:30:34.347
(shouting)

01:30:36.682 --> 01:30:38.851

01:30:56.327 --> 01:30:59.455
- You can get up. It's all over.
- Shel, we can get up now.

01:30:59.539 --> 01:31:02.166
Where the hell were you, Barry?
We almost croaked here.

01:31:02.250 --> 01:31:04.794
- Oh, the traffic was brutal.
- You knew he was coming?

01:31:04.877 --> 01:31:06.462
- You Shelly Kornpett?
- Yeah.

01:31:06.546 --> 01:31:08.172
- Barry Lutz.
- Oh, yeah.

01:31:08.256 --> 01:31:11.467
- The guy I talked to on the telephone.
- I'm sorry to give you the runaround.

01:31:11.551 --> 01:31:14.387
But I'm sure you understand now.
Vince, where are the engravings?

01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:16.639
Well, he's got a vault
behind the tiger painting.

01:31:16.722 --> 01:31:18.641
You know we almost got killed here?

01:31:18.724 --> 01:31:21.561
Wait a minute. You made all that up
about him on the phone?

01:31:21.644 --> 01:31:24.480
We really had to keep you in the dark, Shelly.
Vince, the money?

01:31:24.564 --> 01:31:26.482
It's over here. The whole schmear.

01:31:26.566 --> 01:31:29.777
- And we got another 10 ‒
- And it's in thousands.

01:31:29.861 --> 01:31:31.988
- Stacks of 50.
- Yeah, and there's more. We got ‒

01:31:32.071 --> 01:31:35.783
Yeah, a lot more, a lot more to the story
than we can tell you now, Barry.

01:31:35.867 --> 01:31:37.493
- Beautiful.
- There is another 10 million.

01:31:37.577 --> 01:31:40.037
- I give him 20, not 10!
- Of course you did.

01:31:40.121 --> 01:31:43.833
This <i>bandido</i> has another 10!
<i>¡Ladrones!</i>

01:31:43.916 --> 01:31:49.130
- Come on, get him the hell out of here.
<i>- ¡Ladrón! ¡Bandido¡ ¡Cabrón!</i>

01:31:49.213 --> 01:31:53.092
<i>- ¡Bandido!¡Cabrón!</i>
- Guys, you did fantastic work.

01:31:54.927 --> 01:31:57.638
- Relieved?
- Oh, yes.

01:31:57.722 --> 01:31:59.891
- Great feeling, ain't it?
- Yes, it is.

01:31:59.974 --> 01:32:03.561
We'd love to stand around and schmooze,
Barr, but we got a big day tomorrow.

01:32:03.644 --> 01:32:07.315
- Our kids are getting married.
- Well, I couldn't be happier for both of you.

01:32:07.398 --> 01:32:09.942
Uh, guess I won't see you
till Wednesday.

01:32:10.526 --> 01:32:13.029
- Wednesday?
- Next Wednesday?

01:32:13.112 --> 01:32:15.573
- We have a date in Peru.
- Uh ‒

01:32:16.741 --> 01:32:18.367
I don't think so, Barry.

01:32:18.451 --> 01:32:21.370
Sorry to run, but we gotta catch a plane.

01:32:28.544 --> 01:32:31.130
Hey, wait a minute!

01:32:32.548 --> 01:32:34.050
Vince!

01:32:36.719 --> 01:32:39.222
What do you mean?
You're quitting the agency?

01:32:39.305 --> 01:32:41.682
I've had it, Barry.
My kid's getting married tomorrow.

01:32:41.766 --> 01:32:43.768
There's gonna be grandchildren.

01:32:43.851 --> 01:32:45.728
I'm tired. It's over.

01:32:45.811 --> 01:32:47.897
So take a desk job.

01:32:47.980 --> 01:32:50.399
Nah, that's not for me.

01:32:50.483 --> 01:32:54.612
I'll tell ya something else.
I don't believe in this crap anymore.

01:32:54.695 --> 01:32:57.073
I mean, it used to be
like cowboys and Indians.

01:32:57.156 --> 01:32:59.075
Now?

01:32:59.158 --> 01:33:01.661
I almost died
for the international monetary system.

01:33:01.744 --> 01:33:04.664
- I mean, what the hell is that?
- The family took a vote.

01:33:04.747 --> 01:33:06.749
We want him out of this.

01:33:09.502 --> 01:33:11.254
(engine starts)

01:33:11.337 --> 01:33:13.756
You can make it on your pension?

01:33:13.839 --> 01:33:15.800
I'll give it a shot.

01:33:19.845 --> 01:33:21.973
(both laughing)

01:33:22.056 --> 01:33:25.434
(laughing continues)

01:33:25.518 --> 01:33:28.312
(laughing grows louder)

01:33:31.107 --> 01:33:34.110
(laughing hysterically)

01:33:36.404 --> 01:33:38.364
(crowd chattering)

01:34:10.229 --> 01:34:14.483
Mom, we cannot wait any longer.
What's with them?

01:34:14.567 --> 01:34:16.527
They called from the airport
two hours ago.

01:34:16.610 --> 01:34:18.571
I know.

01:34:18.654 --> 01:34:20.573
Well, you look so pretty.

01:34:22.241 --> 01:34:24.660
What did Dad pull this time?

01:34:24.744 --> 01:34:28.456
Tommy, why do you always assume
it's your father's fault?

01:34:31.083 --> 01:34:33.586
Oh, of course it's his fault.

01:34:35.921 --> 01:34:36.881
Man.

01:34:36.964 --> 01:34:40.134
- I'll never forgive him.
- Carol, what do you think we should do?

01:34:40.217 --> 01:34:41.761
- I don't know.
- Let's get going.

01:34:41.844 --> 01:34:44.305
- Maybe they'll make it for lunch.
- Oh, it's such a shame.

01:34:44.388 --> 01:34:47.058
- What'd you say?
- I said it's such a shame.

01:34:47.141 --> 01:34:49.310
(helicopter whirring)

01:34:49.393 --> 01:34:51.187
Holy shit.

01:35:16.003 --> 01:35:18.422
(applause)

01:35:26.222 --> 01:35:29.809
SHELDON: Oh! (chuckles) Made it.

01:35:29.892 --> 01:35:31.894
(laughing)
Sorry we're late, folks.

01:35:31.977 --> 01:35:35.106
VINCE: What a day.
What a guy. What an entrance.

01:35:35.856 --> 01:35:38.067
- Off we go, Shel.
- Hey, Vince!

01:35:38.150 --> 01:35:40.277
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

01:35:40.361 --> 01:35:42.530
VINCE: How are the hors d'oeuvres?

01:35:46.826 --> 01:35:48.828
Okay, let's do it!

01:35:48.911 --> 01:35:51.080
- Thanks for waiting.
- Shelly.

01:35:51.163 --> 01:35:53.290
- Mwah!
- Two days we were crazy.

01:35:53.374 --> 01:35:55.626
Everything's terrific.
Ooh, you look wonderful.

01:35:55.709 --> 01:35:57.420
- BARBARA: You okay?
- SHELDON: Yeah, I'm great.

01:35:57.503 --> 01:35:59.964
- You'll never know how great.
- Oh, honey, we have to start.

01:36:00.047 --> 01:36:02.425
Just give the orchestra
five minutes to tune up.

01:36:02.508 --> 01:36:04.927
Orchestra?
Sylvia Jacobs is playing the piano.

01:36:05.010 --> 01:36:07.930
- No, no, we have an orchestra.
- Dad, will you please be serious?

01:36:08.013 --> 01:36:11.100
I'm serious. We have Carmen Dragon
and the Paramus Philharmonic.

01:36:11.183 --> 01:36:12.643
- Shelly.
- Listen.

01:36:12.726 --> 01:36:15.104
(orchestra tuning up)

01:36:16.814 --> 01:36:19.316
Oh, my God!
(giggling)

01:36:24.196 --> 01:36:26.282
- Tom?
- Dad.

01:36:26.365 --> 01:36:29.326
Dad, where the hell have you been?

01:36:37.668 --> 01:36:39.920
Well, you're really a man now, Tom.

01:36:42.506 --> 01:36:45.634
Remember how we used to play ball
together on Nagle Avenue?

01:36:46.427 --> 01:36:48.846
We never played ball together
on Nagle Avenue.

01:36:48.929 --> 01:36:51.474
We talked about
playing ball together, but ‒

01:36:51.557 --> 01:36:54.602
Well, maybe this will make it up to you.

01:36:54.685 --> 01:36:56.729
This is from Shelly and me.

01:36:56.812 --> 01:36:58.314
Barbara got one too.

01:37:18.209 --> 01:37:21.545
- Dad, this is a million dollars.
- Yeah, it's not enough? I'll give you more.

01:37:21.629 --> 01:37:23.756
I finally impressed my son.

01:37:24.798 --> 01:37:28.677
- Dad, is this all from root canals?
- Well, that and the lectures.

01:37:28.761 --> 01:37:30.763
Daddy.

01:37:30.846 --> 01:37:32.348
(tapping music stand)

01:37:37.937 --> 01:37:43.192
♪♪ ("The Bridal Chorus")

01:37:54.495 --> 01:37:58.541
Oh, God. Oh, my God. I knew it.
I could feel it coming.

01:37:58.624 --> 01:38:02.461
- This is it, Vince. This is it.
- Let me do the talking.

01:38:03.128 --> 01:38:04.463
Hey, Barr!

01:38:07.550 --> 01:38:09.552
What a nice surprise.

01:38:10.636 --> 01:38:13.347
I didn't think you'd be all
that delighted to see me, Vince.

01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:15.558
Frankly, I'm just shocked
and disappointed.

01:38:15.641 --> 01:38:17.893
- Barry, it's very simple.
- It's simple.

01:38:17.977 --> 01:38:19.436
- We counted wrong, Barr.
- Dad ‒

01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:22.898
- Why don't you go wait in the house?
- I'd like your daughter to be here, Sheldon.

01:38:22.982 --> 01:38:24.650
- What is this about?
- What is this about?

01:38:24.733 --> 01:38:28.571
Your father-in-law and I worked for nearly
10 years, laying our lives on the line together.

01:38:28.654 --> 01:38:31.323
- What does he do to me now?
- Barry, will you listen to me?

01:38:31.407 --> 01:38:33.951
It was so simple.
We made a mistake in the counting ‒

01:38:34.034 --> 01:38:36.620
He doesn't even invite me
to his own son's wedding.

01:38:36.704 --> 01:38:38.706
In the counting of the invitations.

01:38:40.082 --> 01:38:41.750
We got mixed up.

01:38:41.834 --> 01:38:44.128
I remember Vince saying
he wanted to invite you.

01:38:44.211 --> 01:38:45.754
You know how it is, Barry.

01:38:45.838 --> 01:38:49.008
You got a family and all,
and uncles and aunts and cousins.

01:38:49.091 --> 01:38:52.428
Get out of here. Can't you tell
when I'm ribbing you, Vince?

01:38:52.511 --> 01:38:54.930
Here's a little something
from the boys at the agency.

01:38:55.014 --> 01:38:56.932
- Fifty dollar savings bond.
- Oh!

01:38:57.016 --> 01:39:02.146
- Isn't that nice!
- I'll just put it right here for safekeeping.

01:39:02.229 --> 01:39:05.190
- Well, let's have a seat.
- Well, why don't we, uh ‒

01:39:45.814 --> 01:39:49.735
Hey! Hey!
(shouting in Cantonese)
