00:19.800 --> 00:23.120
# There's no business
like show business #

00:23.160 --> 00:26.960
# Like no business I know #

00:29.720 --> 00:40.200
# Let's go on with the show #

01:18.480 --> 01:21.280
# There's no business
like show business #

01:21.360 --> 01:24.480
# Like no business I know #

01:24.560 --> 01:27.360
# Yesterday they told you
you would not go far #

01:27.440 --> 01:30.240
# That night you open
and there you are #

01:30.320 --> 01:32.000
# Next day on your dressing room #

01:32.080 --> 01:33.440
# They've hung a star #

01:33.520 --> 01:40.760
# Let's go on with the show #

01:41.320 --> 01:43.200
# You promised #

01:43.240 --> 01:48.120
# That you'd forget me not #

01:48.200 --> 01:55.200
# But you forgot to remember #

02:05.280 --> 02:07.600
# When that midnight choo-choo
leaves for Alabam' #

02:07.680 --> 02:09.039
# I got to catch that train #

02:09.120 --> 02:10.960
# I'll be right there #

02:11.039 --> 02:13.360
# I've got my fare #

02:13.440 --> 02:16.480
# When I see that
rusty-haired conductor man #

02:16.560 --> 02:17.520
# I got to find that man #

02:17.600 --> 02:18.760
# I'll grab him
by the collar #

02:18.840 --> 02:19.800
# And I'll holler #

02:19.880 --> 02:20.880
- # Ala... #
- # Bam' #

02:20.960 --> 02:22.000
- # Ala...' #
- # Bam... #

02:22.080 --> 02:23.920
# That's where
you stop your train #

02:24.000 --> 02:25.840
# That brings me back again #

02:25.920 --> 02:28.080
# Down home
where I'll remain #

02:28.160 --> 02:29.840
# Where my honey lamb #

02:29.920 --> 02:30.960
# Am #

02:31.040 --> 02:33.200
# I will be right there
with bells #

02:33.280 --> 02:35.120
# When that old
conductor yells #

02:35.200 --> 02:36.240
# All aboard #

02:36.320 --> 02:37.240
# All aboard #

02:37.320 --> 02:40.720
# All aboard
for Alabamy #

02:40.800 --> 02:41.680
Board!

02:41.760 --> 02:43.120
# For Alabam' #

02:43.200 --> 02:44.440
# For Alabamy #

02:44.480 --> 02:45.520
Board!

02:45.600 --> 02:47.920
# I'll be right there
with bells #

02:48.000 --> 02:49.840
# When that
old conductor yells #

02:49.920 --> 02:51.600
# All aboard #

02:51.680 --> 02:54.640
# For Alabam' #

03:04.240 --> 03:13.280
# When that midnight choo-choo
leaves for Alabam' #

04:00.480 --> 04:01.720
Stop!

04:01.760 --> 04:04.120
# In days of yore
before the war #

04:04.160 --> 04:06.520
# When hearts now old
were young #

04:06.560 --> 04:08.760
# At home each night
by firelight #

04:08.800 --> 04:11.960
# Those dear old songs
were sung #

04:12.000 --> 04:14.680
# Sweet melodies
and memories #

04:14.720 --> 04:16.920
# Around my heart
still cling #

04:16.959 --> 04:20.440
# That's why I like
to hear a song #

04:20.480 --> 04:27.240
# Like mother
used to sing #

04:27.320 --> 04:33.400
# Won't you play
a simple melody #

04:33.440 --> 04:39.280
# Like my mother
sang to me? #

04:40.480 --> 04:46.520
# One with good
old-fashioned harmony #

04:46.560 --> 04:52.520
# Play a simple melody #

04:52.600 --> 04:53.720
# Musical demon #

04:53.760 --> 04:54.920
# Sets your honey
a-dreamin' #

04:55.000 --> 04:57.320
# Won't you
play me some rag? #

04:57.400 --> 04:59.400
# Just change that
classical nag #

04:59.480 --> 05:02.520
# To some sweet
beautiful drag #

05:02.560 --> 05:04.840
# If you will
play from the copy #

05:04.920 --> 05:06.120
# Of a tune
that is choppy #

05:06.200 --> 05:08.200
# You'll get
all my applause #

05:08.280 --> 05:11.040
# And that is
simply because #

05:11.080 --> 05:13.440
# I want to listen to rag #

05:13.480 --> 05:14.920
# A... #

05:15.000 --> 05:16.040
# Musical demon #

05:16.120 --> 05:17.480
# Sets your honey
a-dreamin' #

05:17.560 --> 05:19.400
# But won't you
play me some rag? #

05:19.480 --> 05:22.240
# Just change that
classical nag #

05:22.320 --> 05:25.000
# To some sweet
beautiful drag #

05:25.080 --> 05:27.240
# If you will play
from a copy #

05:27.320 --> 05:28.840
# Of a tune
that is choppy #

05:28.920 --> 05:30.600
# You'll get all
my applause #

05:30.680 --> 05:33.320
# And that is
simply because #

05:33.400 --> 05:36.080
# I want to hear
some ragtime music #

05:36.160 --> 05:37.640
# That's what
you want to hear #

05:37.720 --> 05:40.200
# A sweet song with
a sigh and a tear #

05:40.280 --> 05:46.080
# A good old
ragtime simple melody #

06:23.320 --> 06:25.120
"Peter Rabbit was a very bad
little rabbit,

06:25.160 --> 06:26.400
"and that's why
Peter Rabbit

06:26.440 --> 06:27.840
"was sent to bed
without his supper.

06:27.880 --> 06:29.880
"But Flopsy, Mopsy,
and Cotton-Tail,

06:29.960 --> 06:31.360
they had ice cream
and raspberry jam."

06:31.400 --> 06:32.800
They say it's late.

06:32.840 --> 06:33.880
How late?

06:33.960 --> 06:35.360
I don't know.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.800
They just said
it was late.

06:36.840 --> 06:38.240
Well, I know that.

06:38.280 --> 06:39.680
You didn't have to go
all the way over there

06:39.720 --> 06:41.120
to find that out.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.560
Don't yell at me, Molly.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.000
I don't run the railroad.

06:44.040 --> 06:47.280
Wake me up when
the train gets here.

06:47.360 --> 06:48.400
Terry.

06:48.480 --> 06:49.520
Already?

06:49.600 --> 06:51.440
No. No. Terry,
this is a crummy way

06:51.520 --> 06:52.880
to bring up kids.

06:52.960 --> 06:54.320
Oh, Molly, don't start
sending the kids

06:54.400 --> 06:55.760
back to your mother

06:55.840 --> 06:57.200
just because
the train is late.

06:57.280 --> 06:58.640
Steve ought to go
to school,

06:58.720 --> 07:00.560
and they should be
sleeping in beds

07:00.640 --> 07:02.000
instead of--oh,
it's just not right

07:02.080 --> 07:03.440
keeping them up all hours
of the night like this.

07:03.520 --> 07:04.880
I want them to have
an education,

07:04.960 --> 07:06.320
a real education.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.760
They have to learn
arithmetic and spelling

07:07.840 --> 07:08.880
and geography.

07:08.960 --> 07:10.160
You never went past
the sixth grade.

07:10.240 --> 07:11.600
It was probably
the fourth grade

07:11.680 --> 07:13.040
because you said
it was the sixth.

07:13.120 --> 07:14.480
My age is the only thing
I lie about,

07:14.560 --> 07:15.920
and I don't add on,
I take off.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.200
All right,
the sixth grade,

07:17.280 --> 07:18.320
but there's
nothing wrong

07:18.400 --> 07:19.440
with your arithmetic.

07:19.520 --> 07:20.560
<i>You can whistle
Mandy</i>

07:20.640 --> 07:21.680
<i>doing
Off To Buffalo</i>

07:21.760 --> 07:23.000
and count the house
at the same time

07:23.040 --> 07:24.080
and tell me
within 5 cents

07:24.160 --> 07:25.200
how much is
out there.

07:25.280 --> 07:26.480
That's not arithmetic.

07:26.560 --> 07:27.760
Darn right that's not.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.040
That's higher mathematics.

07:29.120 --> 07:30.480
Besides,
the welfare workers

07:30.560 --> 07:32.400
are going
to crack down on us

07:32.480 --> 07:33.680
wherever we go, just like
they did in Pittsburgh.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.120
I handled it there,
didn't I?

07:35.200 --> 07:36.560
Why don't you let me
worry about that?

07:36.640 --> 07:38.280
Oh, quiet. You'll
wake up the children.

07:44.240 --> 07:45.600
Oh, Father dear,

07:45.680 --> 07:48.480
will you see if there's
a dry diaper for the baby

07:48.560 --> 07:49.920
in that basket?

07:50.000 --> 07:51.040
Diaper. Is that
the kind of thing

07:51.120 --> 07:52.480
you mention in public?

07:52.520 --> 07:53.600
Sometimes.

07:53.680 --> 07:55.520
Don't bother. He hasn't
worn them for two years.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.440
You know, if there was
any way to divide up

07:57.520 --> 07:58.560
three children evenly...

07:58.640 --> 08:00.000
Yes?

08:00.080 --> 08:02.400
<i>P.A. Announcement:
The Western track two.</i>

08:02.480 --> 08:03.840
All aboard for Scranton.

08:03.920 --> 08:06.720
Come on, joy boy.
That's our train.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.160
Come on, darling,
wake up.

08:08.240 --> 08:09.600
Wake up. Come on.
We have to go.

08:09.680 --> 08:11.040
You get these two,
will you?

08:11.120 --> 08:12.480
And that big one.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.400
I can handle
the rest of them.

08:14.480 --> 08:15.840
Here, honey,
you take this one.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.280
Take good care
of it now.

08:17.360 --> 08:18.240
Help with the luggage now.

08:19.280 --> 08:20.640
Steve, ask your father

08:20.720 --> 08:22.080
if he remembered
to change my berth

08:22.160 --> 08:23.200
to a lower.

08:23.280 --> 08:24.640
Katy, ask Pop
if he remembered

08:24.720 --> 08:25.920
to make the change.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.360
How about the change,
Daddy?

08:27.440 --> 08:28.800
I got plenty of change.

08:28.880 --> 08:30.240
I'll take care
of the porter.

08:30.320 --> 08:31.680
He says he's got it.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.120
He got the lower, Mom.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.559
Good. If there's
one thing I hate,

08:34.640 --> 08:36.000
it's sleeping
in an upper berth

08:36.080 --> 08:37.440
with three kids.

08:44.159 --> 08:45.560
Come on, honey.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.400
Here's Flopsy.

08:48.480 --> 08:49.560
Here's Mopsy.

08:49.600 --> 08:52.480
And you've got
Cotton-Tail.

08:55.040 --> 08:57.240
And you, too,
Peter Rabbit.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.720
Wait till you see our finish.

09:02.640 --> 09:04.240
Terry yelled
his head off, of course.

09:04.320 --> 09:06.160
He still wanted to keep them
on the road with us,

09:06.240 --> 09:08.080
but as the children
grew older,

09:08.160 --> 09:09.520
I finally won out.

09:09.600 --> 09:12.400
We put them in a very good
school in Boston.

09:12.480 --> 09:13.840
Poor kids.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.240
And that meant we had
to figure out a new act.

09:16.320 --> 09:18.000
You sure had
a brilliant idea

09:18.080 --> 09:19.440
for that little gem.

09:19.520 --> 09:20.840
I sure did:

09:20.880 --> 09:22.280
Eight
beautiful blondes.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.400
Nine.

09:23.440 --> 09:24.520
Nine?

09:24.560 --> 09:25.840
Yes, nine.

09:28.480 --> 09:34.000
# A pretty girl #

09:34.080 --> 09:38.160
# Is like a melody #

09:38.240 --> 09:46.000
# That haunts you
night and day #

09:46.080 --> 09:49.680
# Just like the strain #

09:49.760 --> 09:52.880
# Of a haunting refrain #

09:52.960 --> 09:56.560
# She'll start upon
a marathon #

09:56.640 --> 10:00.080
# And run around
your brain #

10:00.160 --> 10:03.160
# You can't escape #

10:03.240 --> 10:07.520
# She's in your memory #

10:07.600 --> 10:14.480
# By morning, night,
and noon #

10:14.560 --> 10:19.440
# She will leave you
and then #

10:19.520 --> 10:22.400
# Come back again #

10:22.480 --> 10:28.720
# A pretty girl is just
like a pretty tune #

10:28.800 --> 10:30.640
# A pretty girl #

10:30.720 --> 10:33.520
# La ta da
ta da de da #

10:33.600 --> 10:34.640
# Is like a melody #

10:34.720 --> 10:37.320
# La ta da
ta da de da #

10:37.360 --> 10:41.640
# That haunts you
night and day #

10:41.680 --> 10:43.720
# They go together
like sunny weather #

10:43.760 --> 10:45.160
# Goes with
the month of May #

10:45.200 --> 10:46.440
# Just like the strain #

10:46.480 --> 10:48.360
# La la la la la la-- #

10:48.400 --> 10:51.240
# Of a haunting refrain #

10:51.280 --> 10:55.000
# She'll start upon
a marathon #

10:55.080 --> 10:57.920
# And run around
your brain #

10:58.000 --> 11:01.640
# You can't escape,
no, no, no, no, n-- #

11:01.680 --> 11:04.520
# She's in your memory #

11:04.560 --> 11:13.000
# In your memory by
morning, night, and noon #

11:13.040 --> 11:17.000
# She will leave you
and then... #

11:17.040 --> 11:20.840
# Come back again #

11:20.880 --> 11:26.760
# A pretty girl is
just like a pretty tune #

11:28.720 --> 11:31.080
Terrence was
having so much fun

11:31.120 --> 11:32.920
that I hated to spoil it,

11:33.000 --> 11:35.800
but Saturday night,
that was the end of that.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.440
It was good-bye, blondes.

11:48.840 --> 11:49.880
Shh!

11:49.960 --> 11:51.160
Tim, we ought
to go back.

11:51.240 --> 11:53.080
We're just going to get
in a lot of trouble.

11:53.160 --> 11:54.520
Katy's waiting for us
out in the bushes.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.880
You're not going to go
chicken now, are you?

11:57.960 --> 11:59.000
Come on!

12:04.680 --> 12:06.680
Going somewhere?

12:06.760 --> 12:09.120
Suppose you come
in here, boys.

12:30.520 --> 12:31.880
What is it?

12:31.960 --> 12:33.000
Trouble.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.120
Where?

12:34.200 --> 12:35.080
School.

12:37.240 --> 12:38.600
I don't want you
to think that the children

12:38.680 --> 12:40.080
have caused
any serious trouble.

12:40.120 --> 12:42.000
On the contrary,
they're fine youngsters,

12:42.040 --> 12:43.400
and we'd like
to keep them very much.

12:43.480 --> 12:44.880
I just thought it best

12:44.920 --> 12:46.280
that we have
a little talk.

12:46.360 --> 12:47.760
I hope my telegram
didn't interfere

12:47.800 --> 12:49.160
too much
with your plans.

12:49.240 --> 12:51.120
That's all right, Father.
We closed last night.

12:51.160 --> 12:53.040
We'll be laying off
for Lent anyway.

12:53.080 --> 12:54.480
Oh, isn't that
interesting?

12:54.520 --> 12:55.880
I didn't know actors

12:55.960 --> 12:57.360
gave up the theater
for Lent.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.760
Well, not exactly, Father.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.720
Let's say that the theater
gives up actors for Lent.

13:00.760 --> 13:02.160
Does the box office
fall off?

13:02.200 --> 13:05.040
Yes, Father. Ours falls off.
Yours picks up.

13:05.080 --> 13:06.440
Oh, I understand,

13:06.520 --> 13:07.920
but to return
to the children.

13:07.960 --> 13:09.840
The fact is, they want
to be back with you.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.240
Did they tell you that?

13:11.320 --> 13:12.720
Well, they've
done more than that.

13:12.760 --> 13:14.640
They tried
to run away. Twice.

13:14.680 --> 13:15.720
No.

13:15.800 --> 13:16.840
Yes.

13:16.920 --> 13:18.320
Why? Is the work
too much for them?

13:18.360 --> 13:19.720
I mean,
are they dumbbells?

13:19.800 --> 13:21.200
Oh, no.
Not at all.

13:21.240 --> 13:23.120
If there's something
wrong with our kids,

13:23.160 --> 13:25.040
you don't have
to horse around. You can...

13:25.080 --> 13:26.560
Oh, I beg your pardon,
Father.

13:26.640 --> 13:27.920
That's quite all right.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.360
No, there's nothing
wrong with them.

13:29.440 --> 13:30.800
Quite the contrary.

13:30.880 --> 13:32.240
Steve is a fine student,

13:32.320 --> 13:33.360
quiet, serious.

13:33.440 --> 13:34.800
Quite an unusual boy.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.720
Katherine, well,
the sisters tell me

13:36.800 --> 13:37.920
she's above average.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.320
And, uh, Timothy?

13:39.400 --> 13:40.440
Well, uh...

13:40.520 --> 13:43.320
Timothy is all boy,
shall we say?

13:43.400 --> 13:44.760
A natural born leader.

13:44.840 --> 13:46.200
Great kid, huh, Father?

13:46.280 --> 13:47.320
Unfortunately,

13:47.400 --> 13:48.760
sometimes he leads
the others

13:48.840 --> 13:50.200
in the wrong direction.

13:50.280 --> 13:51.800
Oh, there's
nothing serious.

13:51.880 --> 13:53.240
What I'm trying
to say is,

13:53.320 --> 13:54.680
the children
are just not happy

13:54.760 --> 13:56.120
away from you
and the theater.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.040
Happy? Who told them
they're supposed to be happy?

13:58.120 --> 13:59.480
They're supposed
to be learning things.

13:59.560 --> 14:00.920
Well, in any event,

14:01.000 --> 14:02.360
I think that you
and your husband

14:02.440 --> 14:03.800
should have a talk
with them

14:03.880 --> 14:05.720
and try to explain
to them how you feel.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.160
Personally,
I find something

14:07.240 --> 14:08.600
very rare and precious
in this feeling

14:08.680 --> 14:11.480
they have for you
and your profession.

14:11.560 --> 14:14.360
Of course, it's up
to you to decide.

14:14.440 --> 14:16.280
Excuse me.
I'll get them.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.800
Get that bit
about Tim?

14:20.880 --> 14:22.240
"Natural born leader."

14:22.320 --> 14:23.200
Look, birdbrain,

14:23.280 --> 14:25.160
Father Dineen was trying
to tell us

14:25.200 --> 14:26.480
in a very nice way

14:26.560 --> 14:28.400
that we've got a little
gangster on our hands.

14:28.480 --> 14:29.840
Didn't you get it?

14:29.920 --> 14:31.280
The kids are going
to stay right here, Terry.

14:31.360 --> 14:32.720
Who says they're not?

14:32.800 --> 14:34.160
Don't act so innocent.
I know you.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.600
You're a pushover
for those kids.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.040
Me? You're the one

14:37.120 --> 14:38.480
that's always
giving in to them.

14:38.560 --> 14:39.920
Not this time.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.080
I'm going to be as firm
as the rock of Gibraltar.

14:54.880 --> 14:57.680
The rock of Gibraltar.

14:57.760 --> 15:00.560
The kids knew we bought
a house in Jersey,

15:00.640 --> 15:02.960
but this was the first
time they'd seen it.

15:03.040 --> 15:05.360
And what a time
to face a big fat mortgage.

15:05.440 --> 15:06.640
Crash!

15:06.720 --> 15:07.760
Depression!

15:07.840 --> 15:09.680
And the first thing
that people gave up

15:09.760 --> 15:11.120
was the theater.

15:11.200 --> 15:13.040
And the first thing
the theater gave up

15:13.120 --> 15:14.480
was the Donahues.

15:14.560 --> 15:15.920
Boy, the things
we had to do

15:16.000 --> 15:17.360
to make a buck.

15:17.440 --> 15:18.800
A couple of seasons there,

15:18.880 --> 15:20.240
we even split up.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.520
# She's not so good
in the house #

15:24.560 --> 15:26.440
# But on a bench
in the park #

15:26.480 --> 15:28.200
# You'd be surprised #

15:28.240 --> 15:29.320
# She isn't much
in the light #

15:29.360 --> 15:30.880
# But when she gets
in the dark #

15:30.960 --> 15:33.160
# You'd be surprised #

15:33.200 --> 15:35.560
# At a party
or at a ball #

15:35.600 --> 15:37.800
# I got to admit,
she's nothin' at all #

15:37.840 --> 15:39.560
# But in the Morris chair #

15:39.600 --> 15:42.760
# You'd be surprised #

15:42.840 --> 15:44.200
And when I say coffee,

15:44.280 --> 15:46.120
I don't mean
just any coffee.

15:46.160 --> 15:49.000
I mean Shelby's
aerated, vacuumized

15:49.040 --> 15:50.920
flavor in the bean
coffee,

15:50.960 --> 15:52.840
which comes in three
delicious grinds:

15:52.880 --> 15:53.960
Instant...

15:54.000 --> 15:56.040
perk...

15:56.080 --> 15:57.480
And drip.

15:57.520 --> 15:58.600
# So #

15:58.640 --> 16:00.520
# Let's have
another cup of coffee #

16:00.560 --> 16:01.960
Yes, let's have another cup

16:02.000 --> 16:04.200
of Shelby's
aerated coffee.

16:04.240 --> 16:07.720
# And let's have
another piece of pie #

16:07.760 --> 16:10.120
Then one day
things started picking up.

16:10.160 --> 16:12.040
We were in the chips again,

16:12.080 --> 16:14.440
playing big picture houses
all across the country.

16:14.480 --> 16:15.880
Till about '37.

16:15.920 --> 16:17.800
That was the year
Tim surprised us all

16:17.840 --> 16:19.240
and graduated
from high school.

16:19.280 --> 16:21.080
And we started
working out a new act

16:21.160 --> 16:22.520
for the whole family.

16:22.600 --> 16:25.880
Katy's love was dancing,
and the kid was good.

16:25.960 --> 16:27.320
Steve was no hoofer,

16:27.400 --> 16:29.720
but he sure could
sell a song.

16:29.800 --> 16:32.120
Our name
for the new act?

16:32.200 --> 16:34.520
What else?
The Five Donahues!

16:34.600 --> 16:37.880
Working together,
we soon hit the top:

16:37.960 --> 16:40.400
Headliners in a big
hippodrome extravaganza.

16:57.960 --> 16:59.000
# Come on and hear #

16:59.080 --> 17:00.120
# Come on and hear #

# Come on along #

24:44.440 --> 24:46.240
# Come on along,
come on along #

24:46.320 --> 24:54.040
# To see and hear
Alexander's Ragtime Band #

25:16.080 --> 25:17.000
Oh, you!

25:17.040 --> 25:18.440
Hey, it went great,
huh, Pop?

25:18.480 --> 25:19.520
Yeah, Tim. Fine.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.000
You know who was
out front tonight? Flo.

25:21.040 --> 25:22.080
Ziegfeld?

25:22.160 --> 25:24.160
No, Flo Zimmerman,
my cousin from Passaic.

25:24.240 --> 25:25.640
Mit de apple strudel
und the lager beer.

25:25.680 --> 25:27.080
- Lager beer. Skol.
- Skol.

25:27.120 --> 25:28.160
Hi, Timmy.

25:28.240 --> 25:29.280
Oh, hiya, kid.

25:29.320 --> 25:30.720
I'll be with you
in just a minute.

25:30.800 --> 25:31.680
Oh, excusen me.

25:31.760 --> 25:33.120
Important business
up and comin'.

25:33.160 --> 25:34.240
You're excused.

25:34.280 --> 25:35.360
Good-bye.

25:35.440 --> 25:36.800
Terry, have you ever
had a talk with Tim

25:36.880 --> 25:38.080
about--you know--girls?

25:38.120 --> 25:39.520
Yeah, a few times,

25:39.600 --> 25:40.800
but he wouldn't give me
any phone numbers.

25:40.840 --> 25:41.760
No, seriously!

25:41.800 --> 25:42.720
You kidding?
That'd be like me

25:42.760 --> 25:44.160
teaching Dempsey
how to fight.

25:44.240 --> 25:46.080
I wish they'd pick
on someone their own age.

25:46.160 --> 25:47.520
Yeah, me, too.

25:49.480 --> 25:51.360
I hope the kids are ready.
I'm starved.

25:51.400 --> 25:52.480
Me, too.

25:53.840 --> 25:55.080
Come in.

25:56.160 --> 25:58.480
Hiya, Stevie.
Be with you in a minute.

25:58.560 --> 26:00.400
Mind if I go on ahead?

26:00.480 --> 26:01.840
Got a date?

26:01.920 --> 26:02.960
No, no.

26:03.040 --> 26:04.400
It's such a beautiful night,

26:04.480 --> 26:05.840
I just feel like walking.

26:05.920 --> 26:07.280
I got some
thinking to do.

26:07.360 --> 26:09.200
OK, if that's
your idea of fun.

26:09.280 --> 26:10.640
See you later.

26:10.720 --> 26:12.400
So long, Steve.

26:12.480 --> 26:13.840
Terry.

26:13.920 --> 26:14.960
What?

26:15.040 --> 26:16.880
Do you think something's
bothering Steve?

26:16.960 --> 26:18.000
Why?

26:18.080 --> 26:20.400
Well, he seems
so far away these days.

26:20.480 --> 26:23.280
I mean, he's not
always with you.

26:23.360 --> 26:25.680
Kind of like a poet
or something.

26:25.760 --> 26:27.120
Maybe
he'll write lyrics.

26:27.200 --> 26:29.200
No, it's not that.
It's...

26:29.280 --> 26:31.600
No, it's not that,
either. It's...

26:31.680 --> 26:33.520
I don't know,
but it's something.

26:33.600 --> 26:34.640
Yeah.

26:34.720 --> 26:37.040
Well, I'm glad
we got that cleared up.

26:37.120 --> 26:38.160
Ready?

26:45.120 --> 26:46.480
Katy, we're ready.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.360
Katy, you in there?

26:52.320 --> 26:53.640
Where could she be?

26:53.680 --> 26:55.560
She's usually
the first one.

26:57.840 --> 26:58.880
Tim?

26:58.960 --> 27:00.040
Timothy?

27:17.200 --> 27:18.560
How about it?

27:18.640 --> 27:19.520
Fine.

27:19.600 --> 27:20.960
We'll be right back.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.400
Well, uh, don't hurry.

27:22.480 --> 27:24.320
You better bring us
another gin and tonic,

27:24.400 --> 27:26.720
another straight bourbon,
another scotch and soda...

27:26.800 --> 27:28.640
and another
ginger ale, please.

27:28.720 --> 27:29.760
Ginger ale.

27:29.840 --> 27:32.160
Why don't you break down
and have a real drink?

27:32.200 --> 27:33.280
Relax.

27:33.320 --> 27:35.040
Oh, I'm completely relaxed.

27:36.920 --> 27:38.760
Well, this is more like it.

27:38.840 --> 27:40.680
That other place
was a creep joint.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.280
Yeah, and the one
before it was a morgue.

27:42.360 --> 27:43.560
Right.
I'll check my hat.

27:43.640 --> 27:44.880
OK, baby.

27:46.040 --> 27:47.120
Miss?

27:48.160 --> 27:49.200
Uh, Miss?

27:50.360 --> 27:51.680
Good evening, sir.

27:51.760 --> 27:53.600
Welcome to Gallagher's
Golden Pheasant Room.

27:53.680 --> 27:56.000
Check your hat, sir?

27:57.520 --> 27:58.880
Try it again,

27:58.960 --> 28:00.320
a little bit more
from the chest.

28:00.400 --> 28:01.760
Oh, you think so?
My vocal teacher sa--

28:01.840 --> 28:03.680
My vocal teacher says

28:03.760 --> 28:05.120
it's all diaphragm.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.440
All diaphragm?
Hmm hmm.

28:06.480 --> 28:08.400
I'd say there's
quite a lot else there.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.400
Tell me,
what's a girl

28:10.480 --> 28:11.680
with such
pear-shaped tones

28:11.720 --> 28:13.120
doing checking hats?

28:13.200 --> 28:14.560
I am temporarily
between engagements.

28:14.600 --> 28:15.680
Six months temporarily.

28:15.720 --> 28:17.120
And a girl has to eat

28:17.200 --> 28:18.560
and pay
for her singing lessons.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.960
Oh, you're a singer?
I could've sworn

28:21.040 --> 28:22.400
you were
a dramatic actress.

28:22.440 --> 28:23.680
You think
that's impossible.

28:23.760 --> 28:25.600
No, no,
I can just see it now:

28:25.680 --> 28:27.040
You as Lady Macbeth.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.480
What a sleep-walking
scene!

28:28.560 --> 28:30.240
I wonder if some evening
you'd mind--

28:30.320 --> 28:31.800
Skip it. I don't
give private auditions.

28:31.880 --> 28:33.760
Number 35.

28:33.800 --> 28:35.360
How now, brown cow?

28:42.160 --> 28:43.520
Good evening, sir.
Welcome to--

28:43.560 --> 28:45.440
Eddie, did you get him?
Is he coming over?

28:45.480 --> 28:46.880
Yeah. Believe it or not,

28:46.960 --> 28:49.760
the great Lew Harris is
coming over to hear you.

28:49.840 --> 28:51.200
He's on his way.

28:51.240 --> 28:52.640
Helen, take over
for me, will you?

28:52.720 --> 28:54.080
Well, sure, honey.
What's up?

28:54.120 --> 28:55.520
Lew Harris
is coming over.

28:55.600 --> 28:56.960
Lew Harris?
The producer?

28:57.000 --> 28:58.400
I'm going to sing
with the band.

28:58.480 --> 28:59.840
Oh, good luck, honey.

28:59.880 --> 29:01.280
Is this the dress?

29:01.360 --> 29:02.720
Are you sure
it's the right one?

29:02.760 --> 29:04.640
He said it was
the one you picked out.

29:04.680 --> 29:06.560
It cost and arm
and a leg just to rent.

29:06.600 --> 29:08.960
I hope you know
what you're doing.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.400
Eddie, will you
stop worrying?

29:10.440 --> 29:12.800
I've known what I was doing
since I was 6 years old.

29:12.880 --> 29:14.240
Does Gallagher know
you're going on,

29:14.280 --> 29:15.680
or is this a secret

29:15.760 --> 29:17.120
between you
and the band?

29:17.160 --> 29:18.560
Sure, Mr. Gallagher's
in on it.

29:18.640 --> 29:20.480
He knows I've worked
in clubs before.

29:20.560 --> 29:22.400
But how can you
go on and sing

29:22.480 --> 29:23.840
with a strange band?

29:23.880 --> 29:25.280
I'm not singing
with a strange band.

29:25.360 --> 29:26.720
I rehearsed with them
all afternoon,

29:26.760 --> 29:28.160
and they're very friendly.

29:28.240 --> 29:29.600
The head waiter's name
is Carlos.

29:29.640 --> 29:31.520
He has a very good table
for you and Mr. Harris.

29:31.560 --> 29:33.440
And the drinks
are on the house.

29:33.480 --> 29:34.880
Carlos is in on it, too?

29:34.960 --> 29:36.800
Of course. He's even going
to make the waiters

29:36.880 --> 29:38.240
stop serving
while I sing,

29:38.280 --> 29:39.680
and he's very
friendly, too.

29:39.760 --> 29:41.120
I have been an agent
for a good many years,

29:41.160 --> 29:43.520
but this is
the first time

29:43.600 --> 29:44.720
the client
has ever managed me.

29:44.800 --> 29:46.120
Oh, and another thing.

29:46.160 --> 29:48.040
When you bring him back
to see me,

29:48.080 --> 29:49.960
I want to show him
that I'm an actress, too.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.880
<i>I've been working on a scene
from The Cherry Orchard.</i>

29:51.920 --> 29:53.320
<i>The Cherry Orchard.</i>

29:53.360 --> 29:54.760
Vicky, let's save the acting

29:54.800 --> 29:57.160
as a surprise for him
for later. Much later.

29:57.200 --> 29:59.560
Right now, Mr. Harris
wants a singer.

29:59.600 --> 30:00.920
A hot singer!

30:01.000 --> 30:02.160
What song
are you singing?

30:02.240 --> 30:03.480
I'm singing

30:03.560 --> 30:05.720
"After You Get What You Want,
You Don't Want It."

30:05.800 --> 30:07.640
Vicky, for the love
of Mike,

30:07.720 --> 30:09.200
will you forget that
elocution stuff?

30:09.280 --> 30:10.640
<i>It's
After</i>

30:10.720 --> 30:13.040
<i>You Get What You Want.
After. After. After.</i>

30:13.120 --> 30:14.960
OK, Eddie. You run down
and wait for Mr. Harris.

30:15.040 --> 30:16.080
I'll change.

30:16.160 --> 30:18.000
<i>After.</i>

30:18.080 --> 30:19.440
After.

30:19.520 --> 30:20.880
After.

30:20.960 --> 30:22.760
After.

30:22.840 --> 30:24.680
The girls
in the chorus say

30:24.760 --> 30:26.120
you're not to be trusted.

30:26.200 --> 30:27.560
Yeah? What else
they say about me?

30:27.640 --> 30:29.000
Wouldn't you
like to know?

30:29.080 --> 30:30.120
Yeah.

30:30.200 --> 30:31.560
I beg your pardon.
May I please get by here?

30:31.640 --> 30:33.000
Well, if it isn't
Ethel Barrymore.

30:33.080 --> 30:34.440
It was only
yesterday--

30:34.520 --> 30:36.360
Please, let's not play
any more games.

30:36.440 --> 30:37.800
I'm in an awful hurry.

30:37.880 --> 30:39.720
Must be losing my grip.

30:39.800 --> 30:41.160
Something's
happening to me.

30:41.240 --> 30:42.600
You're getting old,
Buster.

30:42.680 --> 30:44.000
Why, you must be
almost 20.

30:44.080 --> 30:45.920
What difference does it
make how old a man is?

30:46.000 --> 30:47.360
Listen, Cheri,

30:47.400 --> 30:49.280
one man in 20 years
may still be a baby,

30:49.320 --> 30:50.720
<i>a mere enfant,</i>

30:50.800 --> 30:52.640
but another may have
lived a full lifetime,

30:52.720 --> 30:54.080
seen everything,
done everything.

30:54.120 --> 30:56.480
<i>It is not how old
you are, mon patoot.</i>

30:56.560 --> 30:57.920
It is the way
you have lived.

30:57.960 --> 30:59.840
It's the wine
you have drunk,

30:59.880 --> 31:01.280
the music
you have heard,

31:01.360 --> 31:02.720
and the women
you have known.

31:02.760 --> 31:05.600
Oh, the stories
I could tell you, kid.

31:05.640 --> 31:07.040
Yeah?
So tell me.

31:07.120 --> 31:08.960
Well, I--Hey, hey.
I'll take the bottle.

31:09.040 --> 31:10.600
And bring another
double gin

31:10.640 --> 31:12.120
for Snow White.

31:26.640 --> 31:28.520
You know,
you're real cute.

31:28.560 --> 31:29.600
Oh.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.440
Well, uh, bottom's up.

31:37.040 --> 31:38.440
You're pretty cute
yourself.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.360
Well, now,
that's more like it.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.200
I thought you were great
in the show tonight.

31:42.280 --> 31:43.640
Oh, did you?

31:43.720 --> 31:45.080
Uh-huh.
You were swell.

31:45.160 --> 31:46.520
Oh, thank you,
but you know,

31:46.600 --> 31:48.440
you didn't see
all of it.

31:48.520 --> 31:49.560
No?

31:49.640 --> 31:51.480
No. We've got a lot
of comedy stuff

31:51.560 --> 31:52.920
that we didn't do.
Real slapstick.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.360
I like slapstick.

31:54.440 --> 31:55.800
I'll bet you do.

31:55.880 --> 31:57.720
We have one bit
that never fails.

31:57.800 --> 31:59.160
Here.
I'll show you.

31:59.240 --> 32:01.560
Put your hands out
like this, flat.

32:01.640 --> 32:03.000
Now, I take
these two glasses

32:03.080 --> 32:04.920
and put them like so.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.040
And?

32:06.120 --> 32:07.160
That's all.

32:07.240 --> 32:08.760
Bye!

32:08.840 --> 32:10.080
Hey!

32:11.240 --> 32:12.600
Mr. Harris' table.

32:12.680 --> 32:14.040
We have a reservation.

32:14.120 --> 32:15.960
Yes, sir.
This way, please.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.360
Ladies and gentlemen,

32:22.440 --> 32:23.800
ladies and gentlemen,

32:23.880 --> 32:26.680
Gallagher's has a little
surprise for you tonight:

32:26.760 --> 32:29.080
A new young talent,
Miss Victoria Hoffman.

32:29.160 --> 32:30.520
Come on, everybody,

32:30.600 --> 32:33.440
let's give the little girl
a great big welcome.

32:53.400 --> 32:56.360
# After you get
what you want #

32:56.440 --> 32:59.400
# You don't want it #

32:59.480 --> 33:03.480
# If I gave you the moon #

33:03.520 --> 33:07.000
# You'd grow tired
of it soon #

33:07.080 --> 33:10.600
# You're like a baby #

33:10.680 --> 33:14.760
# You want what you want
when you want it #

33:14.840 --> 33:20.680
# But after you are
presented #

33:20.760 --> 33:21.960
# With what you want #

33:22.040 --> 33:24.840
# You're discontented #

33:24.920 --> 33:29.160
# You're always
wishing and wanting for #

33:29.240 --> 33:30.760
# Something #

33:30.840 --> 33:34.440
# When you get
what you want #

33:34.520 --> 33:38.840
# You don't want
what you get #

33:38.920 --> 33:43.800
# And though I
sit upon your knee #

33:43.880 --> 33:47.480
# You grow tired of me #

33:47.560 --> 33:49.720
# 'Cause after #

33:49.800 --> 33:51.480
# You get what you want #

33:51.560 --> 33:55.320
# You don't want what
you wanted at all #

34:02.920 --> 34:04.760
# Changeable #

34:04.840 --> 34:08.920
# You've got
a changeable nature #

34:10.120 --> 34:15.560
# Always, always
changing your mind #

34:16.679 --> 34:18.679
# There's a longing
in your eye #

34:18.760 --> 34:21.560
# Hard to satisfy #

34:21.639 --> 34:28.280
# And here's
the reason why #

34:28.360 --> 34:33.400
# 'Cause after #

34:33.480 --> 34:34.679
# You get what you want #

34:34.719 --> 34:37.520
# You don't want it #

34:37.560 --> 34:41.679
# If I gave you the moon #

34:41.760 --> 34:45.679
# You'd grow tired
of it soon #

34:45.719 --> 34:48.880
# You're like a baby #

34:48.920 --> 34:53.199
# You want what you want
when you want it #

34:53.280 --> 34:58.800
# But after you are
presented #

34:58.840 --> 35:00.560
# With what you want #

35:00.600 --> 35:03.760
# You're discontented #

35:03.840 --> 35:07.800
# You're always
wishing and wanting for #

35:07.880 --> 35:09.200
# Something #

35:09.240 --> 35:13.040
# When you get
what you want #

35:13.080 --> 35:17.440
# You don't want
what you get #

35:17.520 --> 35:22.320
# And though I sit
upon your knee #

35:22.360 --> 35:26.320
# You grow tired of me #

35:26.360 --> 35:28.240
# 'Cause after #

35:28.280 --> 35:30.000
# You get what you want #

35:30.040 --> 35:33.920
# You don't want
what you wanted at all #

35:34.000 --> 35:37.920
# Baby, I don't mean
to make you blue #

35:38.000 --> 35:41.760
# But you need
a talkin' to #

35:41.840 --> 35:44.480
# 'Cause after #

35:44.560 --> 35:45.880
# You get what you want #

35:45.960 --> 35:52.960
# You don't want
what you wanted at all #

35:53.040 --> 35:54.760
I know you!

36:04.320 --> 36:06.680
Well, what do you think?

36:06.720 --> 36:08.440
I'm interested.

36:08.480 --> 36:09.400
I knew it.

36:09.440 --> 36:11.160
I knew you'd
flip your lid

36:11.200 --> 36:13.240
over this girl.
Ha ha ha ha.

36:14.400 --> 36:17.640
How do you do, Mr. Harris?

36:17.720 --> 36:22.480
Hello, Mr. Harris.

36:22.560 --> 36:24.480
Hi there, Mr. Harris.

36:29.800 --> 36:30.840
Hello.

36:30.920 --> 36:31.960
Oh, not again.

36:32.040 --> 36:33.880
I'm waiting for someone
terribly important.

36:33.920 --> 36:35.480
This is
terribly important, too.

36:35.560 --> 36:37.040
<i>I happen to be
Kirby from Variety.</i>

36:37.120 --> 36:38.280
I think the world
should know about you.

36:38.360 --> 36:39.320
How about an interview?

36:39.400 --> 36:41.040
This not another one
of your little jokes.

36:41.080 --> 36:42.160
Oh, no,
not when I'm working.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.360
The only thing is I'm
expecting these people.

36:44.440 --> 36:45.480
That's all right.
Why don't we start

36:45.560 --> 36:47.960
and see how far we get.
Oh, excuse me.

36:48.040 --> 36:51.240
Uh, tell me, have you had
any previous experience?

36:51.320 --> 36:52.600
Doing what?

36:52.680 --> 36:54.240
I was thinking
of your stage career,

36:54.320 --> 36:55.200
but I'd be interested
in anything else

36:55.280 --> 36:56.160
you have to tell me.

36:56.240 --> 36:57.600
I see.

36:57.680 --> 36:59.480
Why don't I give you
my telephone number?

36:59.560 --> 37:00.440
Why don't you?

37:00.520 --> 37:02.240
I have
a much better idea.

37:02.320 --> 37:03.960
<i>I'll call you
tomorrow at Variety,</i>

37:04.040 --> 37:05.120
and we can make a date.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.400
Oh, it's, uh, well,

37:06.480 --> 37:07.840
tomorrow happens
to be my day off.

37:07.920 --> 37:09.560
I was afraid
of something like that.

37:10.600 --> 37:12.560
Excuse me.
That must be my guests.

37:13.520 --> 37:15.560
Oh, hello.

37:15.640 --> 37:17.560
Vicky, this is
Mr. Lew Harris.

37:17.640 --> 37:19.120
Charmed, I'm sure.

37:19.200 --> 37:21.000
I enjoyed your performance,
Miss Hoffman.

37:21.080 --> 37:22.480
Did you?
Did you really?

37:22.560 --> 37:23.480
Come in please.

37:23.560 --> 37:25.240
This gentleman
was just leaving.

37:25.320 --> 37:27.480
Tim Donahue.
How are you, kid?

37:27.560 --> 37:29.560
I hear you and the family
are knockin' 'em dead

37:29.640 --> 37:30.520
over at the Hippodrome.

37:30.600 --> 37:31.480
Thank you, Mr. Harris.

37:31.560 --> 37:32.800
One of
The Five Donahues?

37:32.880 --> 37:34.480
Oh, you do
a great act.

37:34.520 --> 37:35.720
I didn't know
you knew him.

37:35.800 --> 37:37.960
We just met.
Mr. Donahue,

37:38.040 --> 37:39.640
it was awfully sweet
of you to come back

37:39.680 --> 37:41.880
and tell me how much
you admired my work.

37:41.920 --> 37:42.920
When one performer

37:43.000 --> 37:44.360
troubles
to tell another,

37:44.440 --> 37:47.000
that's praise indeed.
And tell your family

37:47.040 --> 37:48.280
while I do
appreciate it,

37:48.320 --> 37:50.600
I couldn't possibly
join their act.

37:50.680 --> 37:51.720
I'll tell 'em,

37:51.800 --> 37:53.480
but they'll
be broken-hearted.

37:53.560 --> 37:56.560
I'm sorry, but there are
five of you already,

37:56.600 --> 37:58.760
and I much prefer
working as a single,

37:58.840 --> 38:03.480
if you know what I mean,
and I think you do.

38:08.440 --> 38:10.440
Mad about me.

38:13.120 --> 38:15.760
Timmy, where you been?

38:15.800 --> 38:17.360
I been lookin'
everywhere for you.

38:17.400 --> 38:18.880
I just fumbled,
and the coach took me out.

38:18.960 --> 38:20.400
Whoop,
that's a cute step.

38:20.480 --> 38:21.600
Come on,
let's go someplace

38:21.680 --> 38:23.120
where they appreciate me.

38:27.760 --> 38:29.520
Oh, this is silly.

38:29.560 --> 38:31.320
After all, they're
not children anymore.

38:31.360 --> 38:33.440
No. Come on,
I got a good hand.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.800
They're certainly old enough
to take care of themselves.

38:35.880 --> 38:37.360
Exactly. You go.

38:37.440 --> 38:38.880
Why do you suppose
they didn't tell us,

38:38.960 --> 38:40.360
just sneaking out
that way without--

38:40.440 --> 38:43.200
Molly, that's just
part of growing up.

38:43.280 --> 38:45.000
Remember our first date?

38:45.080 --> 38:46.880
Yeah.

38:46.960 --> 38:48.640
We didn't tell anybody,
either.

38:48.720 --> 38:49.680
No.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.960
You remember how late
we stayed out?

38:52.040 --> 38:53.000
Mm-hmm.

38:53.080 --> 38:56.280
You should've been
ashamed of yourself.

38:56.320 --> 38:58.600
Where the heck
is Katy?

38:58.680 --> 39:00.560
Take it easy.
Now you got me worried.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.400
It's about time,
you big lug.

39:02.480 --> 39:04.560
Here's a taxi.

39:10.200 --> 39:12.720
What do you mean
by coming home

39:12.760 --> 39:13.920
at this hour,
young lady?

39:14.000 --> 39:15.360
You have some
explaining to do.

39:15.440 --> 39:16.640
How sweet of you
to wait up for me.

39:16.720 --> 39:18.760
Do pay the cab fare,
darling.

39:18.840 --> 39:20.120
I'm flat.

39:20.160 --> 39:21.840
Where did
you pick her up?

39:21.880 --> 39:23.320
Outside of Gallagher's joint.

39:23.400 --> 39:24.600
How much do I owe you?

39:24.680 --> 39:25.640
6.20.

39:25.720 --> 39:27.760
6.20? How'd ya come,
by way of Canarsie?

39:27.840 --> 39:28.960
I brought her home,
didn't I?

39:29.040 --> 39:30.360
Thanks.
Got change of 20?

39:30.440 --> 39:31.720
Oh, yeah.

39:31.800 --> 39:33.560
And for all I know, Mom,

39:33.640 --> 39:35.240
he's still sitting there,

39:35.320 --> 39:36.400
dripping.

39:36.480 --> 39:38.240
Let me tell you about
the one I used to use.

39:38.320 --> 39:39.800
A handbag
full of nickels--

39:39.880 --> 39:42.040
anybody got fresh--
clunk.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.960
We used to call it
the woman's defender.

39:45.040 --> 39:46.840
What's so funny?
Your daughter stays out

39:46.920 --> 39:48.400
gallivanting till
all hours of the morning,

39:48.480 --> 39:49.520
and you think
it's a big joke.

39:49.560 --> 39:50.880
Maybe Katy never went
to finishing school,

39:50.960 --> 39:52.600
but there are some parts
of her education

39:52.640 --> 39:54.480
I'll match against anybody's.

39:54.520 --> 39:56.280
Um, Tim get home yet?

39:56.320 --> 39:58.800
No. Why? You see him?
You know where he is?

39:58.880 --> 40:00.800
No. I just wondered.

40:00.880 --> 40:02.800
Where in blazes
have you been?

40:02.840 --> 40:03.800
In church.

40:03.880 --> 40:05.120
Church?

40:05.200 --> 40:06.080
Now I've heard
everything.

40:06.160 --> 40:07.240
No, seriously.

40:07.320 --> 40:08.600
Church at this time
of night?

40:08.680 --> 40:10.680
I went for a walk
through the park first.

40:10.760 --> 40:11.960
Who with?

40:12.000 --> 40:13.720
Nobody. Just myself.

40:13.760 --> 40:15.160
Mom, Dad,

40:15.200 --> 40:16.600
there's something
I want to tell you.

40:16.680 --> 40:18.040
Well...

40:18.120 --> 40:19.120
I don't want you to think

40:19.200 --> 40:21.600
I haven't given this
a lot of thought, but...

40:21.680 --> 40:22.640
Go on.

40:22.680 --> 40:24.920
I'm going
to be a priest.

40:24.960 --> 40:25.880
A what?!

40:25.920 --> 40:27.040
A priest.

40:27.120 --> 40:28.200
You're kidding.

40:28.280 --> 40:29.920
Steve, what are
you talkin' about?

40:30.000 --> 40:31.600
I know this
comes as a big shock

40:31.640 --> 40:33.080
to all of you, but...

40:33.160 --> 40:34.080
it's what I want

40:34.160 --> 40:35.480
more than anything else
in the world.

40:35.520 --> 40:38.200
A priest?!
Why, you must be abs--

40:38.240 --> 40:39.640
Let him finish, Terry.

40:39.680 --> 40:41.080
I talked to Father Dineen

40:41.160 --> 40:42.960
about it last summer.
Today I got a letter

40:43.000 --> 40:43.960
telling me to report
to the seminary

40:44.040 --> 40:44.920
next week.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.320
I am not going
to let you do it.

40:46.360 --> 40:47.280
Terry--

40:47.320 --> 40:48.280
Now, you
stay out of this.

40:48.320 --> 40:50.240
Look, son,
you're very young.

40:50.320 --> 40:51.200
You don't understand

40:51.280 --> 40:52.240
what a wonderful thing
life can be.

40:52.320 --> 40:53.720
You don't know
how wonderful it is

40:53.760 --> 40:55.120
to fall in love
and get married

40:55.160 --> 40:56.120
and raise a family.

40:56.200 --> 40:57.560
I'm not gonna let you
give all that up.

40:57.640 --> 40:59.600
I've thought
about it, Pop.

40:59.640 --> 41:02.160
It's just that some people
are meant to be one thing,

41:02.240 --> 41:03.840
some another.

41:03.920 --> 41:04.960
What about your work?

41:05.040 --> 41:06.200
What about everything
you've been trained for?

41:06.280 --> 41:07.440
What about the theater?

41:07.480 --> 41:09.760
In a way, it's just
a change of booking.

41:09.840 --> 41:12.760
You must admit the church
has had a pretty long run.

41:12.840 --> 41:15.880
I just hope
I have the talent for it.

41:15.960 --> 41:17.280
Beats me.

41:17.360 --> 41:19.440
I can't figure it out.

41:19.480 --> 41:21.960
# Come on along,
come on along #

41:22.040 --> 41:24.520
# Alexander's
Ragtime Band #

41:24.600 --> 41:26.840
# Come on along #
Hello, everybody.

41:26.880 --> 41:28.000
Oh, great.

41:28.080 --> 41:29.400
He's crocked.

41:29.440 --> 41:31.320
I beg your pardon--
stinkied.

41:31.400 --> 41:34.160
Whoops, forgot
to remove my hat.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.160
I'll fix him.

41:35.200 --> 41:36.400
- Now--
- Pop--

41:36.440 --> 41:38.400
I can handle him. I've been
handling him his whole life.

41:38.480 --> 41:40.320
Is there some sort
of dispute going on?

41:40.400 --> 41:42.120
Can I be
of any assis--

41:42.200 --> 41:44.400
Can I be of any--

41:44.440 --> 41:46.440
Oh, Mom, I don't
feel so good.

41:46.520 --> 41:48.600
Oh, no, you don't.
Upstairs for you.

41:48.680 --> 41:51.400
I just had
this carpet cleaned.

41:51.480 --> 41:54.040
What a family.
One of 'em

41:54.080 --> 41:55.120
goes sneaking off
to a nightclub,

41:55.160 --> 41:56.880
one of ‘em comes home
smelling like a saloon,

41:56.920 --> 41:59.480
and the third one--you--
I might've expected you

41:59.560 --> 42:01.720
to come home drunk like Tim,
but I will be a Hindu swami

42:01.760 --> 42:03.280
if I expected
what you gave me tonight.

42:03.360 --> 42:04.800
Pop, don't take it
so big.

42:04.880 --> 42:06.000
Steve might turn out

42:06.040 --> 42:07.160
to be something
really big,

42:07.240 --> 42:10.040
like a bishop
or even a cardinal.

42:10.120 --> 42:12.640
Yeah? The only cardinal
I want in this family

42:12.720 --> 42:15.320
is one that plays ball
with St. Louis.

42:16.960 --> 42:19.000
I could take a--

42:19.080 --> 42:20.000
Bath.

42:20.040 --> 42:22.160
Big man now.
Comin' home like--

42:22.240 --> 42:23.640
You're drowning me.

42:23.680 --> 42:25.320
Don't put any ideas
in my head.

42:25.400 --> 42:26.280
Yeah, but I--

42:26.360 --> 42:27.960
Down, boy. Down.

42:28.040 --> 42:30.840
And don't come up
till I tell ya.

42:34.120 --> 42:35.880
Where am I?

42:40.400 --> 42:41.440
Here.

42:42.480 --> 42:43.440
Give me that.

42:43.520 --> 42:45.800
Will you please, Ma?

42:45.880 --> 42:48.760
Timmy, this hurts you
more than it hurts me.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.480
Now get in there.

42:50.560 --> 42:52.760
I'm getting there.

42:52.800 --> 42:55.320
Come on, get in.
Hurry up.

42:55.400 --> 42:58.200
This way. Put your head
down here on the pillow.

42:58.240 --> 42:59.160
Come on.

43:04.880 --> 43:06.920
All right,
let's have it, sport.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.520
Who were you out with?

43:08.600 --> 43:09.920
Lillian Sawyer.

43:09.960 --> 43:11.360
That tomato?

43:11.400 --> 43:14.720
I think I asked her
to marry me, Mom.

43:14.760 --> 43:17.000
I know I proposed
something.

43:17.080 --> 43:19.440
I bet you did.
What'd you have to drink?

43:19.520 --> 43:22.240
I don't remember,
but we topped it off

43:22.280 --> 43:23.680
with champagne
and root beer.

43:23.720 --> 43:26.000
I was trying to forget.

43:26.080 --> 43:27.000
Forget what?

43:27.040 --> 43:29.360
That's another thing
I don't remember.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.480
Another girl, I think.

43:31.520 --> 43:33.280
Little man,
you've had a busy night.

43:33.360 --> 43:36.840
Yeah. Hello? Hello?

43:36.920 --> 43:38.600
Everything's going
round and round, Ma.

43:38.680 --> 43:40.280
Yes, I know. I know.

43:40.360 --> 43:42.240
You go to sleep now.
We'll talk this over

43:42.320 --> 43:43.200
in the morning.

43:43.280 --> 43:44.160
Oh.

43:44.240 --> 43:46.120
I'm sorry, Mom.

43:46.200 --> 43:47.840
I know you are, kid,

43:47.920 --> 43:50.360
and I'm sorry, too,
if I hurt you.

43:50.440 --> 43:52.800
It's just that
we love you so much

43:52.880 --> 43:54.240
that we intend
to make a man out of you,

43:54.280 --> 43:56.240
even if we have
to murder you first.

43:56.320 --> 43:57.720
Thanks, Mom.

43:57.800 --> 44:00.160
Go to sleep now.

44:00.200 --> 44:01.720
Good night, Ma.

44:01.800 --> 44:03.280
Good night, Tim.

44:09.520 --> 44:10.880
Is he all right?

44:10.920 --> 44:12.440
Oh, he's fine now,

44:12.520 --> 44:14.400
but what he's gonna
feel like in the morning.

44:14.440 --> 44:19.560
Anyway, I hope so.
Steve, I wanna talk to you.

44:19.640 --> 44:21.360
Sure, Mom.

44:26.720 --> 44:29.080
Are you disappointed
in me, too,

44:29.120 --> 44:30.480
the way Dad is?

44:30.560 --> 44:32.240
You can't blame
your father, Steve,

44:32.320 --> 44:34.120
the way you
threw it at him,

44:34.200 --> 44:36.080
just cold,
without any build-up.

44:36.160 --> 44:37.520
He wasn't lookin' for it.

44:37.600 --> 44:39.680
He had different plans
for you.

44:39.760 --> 44:41.640
There's still
Katy and Tim.

44:41.720 --> 44:43.640
Yes, but you're
the firstborn.

44:43.720 --> 44:46.680
There's always something
about the first.

44:46.720 --> 44:50.760
Life's funny.
You raise a kid backstage,

44:50.840 --> 44:52.760
you teach him
every trick you know

44:52.800 --> 44:56.480
about singing and dancing
and how to make people laugh,

44:56.520 --> 44:59.200
and then one day, this.

44:59.280 --> 45:02.280
Why? How come?

45:02.360 --> 45:05.640
I don't know, Ma.
It's inside me.

45:05.720 --> 45:08.480
It must have
always been there.

45:15.960 --> 45:17.880
It's like losin' ya, Steve.

45:17.960 --> 45:20.400
Oh, I know,
not really, but--

45:20.480 --> 45:21.760
Then you are
disappointed.

45:21.840 --> 45:25.120
No, I'm not disappointed.
It's a wonderful thing.

45:25.200 --> 45:27.640
I'm just not
used to it yet,

45:27.680 --> 45:31.040
but I'm proud.
Very proud.

45:31.120 --> 45:32.880
Mom.

45:32.960 --> 45:34.400
# Remember the night #

45:34.440 --> 45:35.880
# Remember the night #

45:35.960 --> 45:38.560
# The night you said #

45:38.640 --> 45:41.360
# I love you? #

45:41.440 --> 45:44.400
# Remember? #

45:44.480 --> 45:46.920
# Remember,
my love #

45:47.000 --> 45:49.800
# All the stars #

45:49.880 --> 45:52.320
# Above you? #

45:52.400 --> 45:55.000
# Remember? #

45:55.040 --> 46:00.600
# Remember, we vowed
to own this spot #

46:00.640 --> 46:05.800
# And after I learned
to care a lot #

46:05.880 --> 46:08.680
# You promised that you'd #

46:08.760 --> 46:13.040
# Forget me not #

46:13.120 --> 46:17.920
# But you forgot #

46:18.000 --> 46:25.440
# To reme-em-em-ber #

46:25.480 --> 46:27.320
When do we open?

46:27.360 --> 46:28.280
Where?

46:28.320 --> 46:29.880
Have another sandwich.

46:31.160 --> 46:33.120
Oh, come on,
let's go inside.

46:33.200 --> 46:34.120
They're starting.

46:34.200 --> 46:35.600
Showtime.

46:35.680 --> 46:37.080
Quiet!

46:37.120 --> 46:38.680
Showtime! Showtime!

46:38.760 --> 46:41.600
You all get settled down.

46:43.320 --> 46:46.200
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

46:46.240 --> 46:49.720
There. Now, since you were
nice enough to surprise me,

46:49.800 --> 46:51.400
I have a surprise for you.

46:51.480 --> 46:53.880
We have a couple of
very talented young people

46:53.960 --> 46:56.200
here with us tonight--songs,
dances, and impressions--

46:56.280 --> 46:58.920
And they would like
to perform for you.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.360
Now, this act
hasn't been seen

47:01.440 --> 47:02.920
in something like
20 years,

47:03.000 --> 47:04.440
and if I'm any
judge of talent,

47:04.520 --> 47:06.080
it'll never be seen again.

47:06.160 --> 47:09.680
Ladies and gentlemen,
The Two Donahues!!

47:19.040 --> 47:21.080
# When that
midnight choo-choo #

47:21.120 --> 47:22.320
# Leaves for Alabam' #

47:22.400 --> 47:23.320
# I gotta catch that train #

47:23.360 --> 47:24.840
# I'll be right there #

47:24.920 --> 47:26.800
# I got my fare #

47:26.880 --> 47:29.960
# When I see that
rusty-haired conductor man #

47:30.040 --> 47:31.080
# I gotta find that man #

47:31.160 --> 47:32.600
# I'll grab him
by the collar #

47:32.640 --> 47:33.600
# And I'll holler #

47:33.680 --> 47:35.040
- # Ala #
- # Bam' #

47:35.120 --> 47:36.920
# That's where you
stop your train #

47:36.960 --> 47:38.880
# That brings me
back again #

47:38.960 --> 47:40.640
# Down home
where I'll remain #

47:40.720 --> 47:43.240
# Where my honey lamb am #

47:43.320 --> 47:45.200
# I will be
right there with bells #

47:45.280 --> 47:47.200
# When that
old conductor yells #

47:47.280 --> 47:48.960
# All aboard, all aboard #

47:49.040 --> 47:52.600
# All aboard
for Alabamy #

47:52.640 --> 47:54.720
# For Alabam' #

47:54.800 --> 47:55.800
# For Alabamy #

47:55.840 --> 47:56.960
Board!

47:57.040 --> 47:58.680
# I'll be right there
with bells #

47:58.760 --> 48:00.880
# When that
old conductor yells #

48:00.960 --> 48:02.520
# All aboo-rd #

48:02.560 --> 48:05.600
# For Alabam' #

48:13.800 --> 48:17.360
# When that midnight
choo-choo leaves for #

48:17.440 --> 48:23.360
# Alabam' #

48:51.880 --> 48:52.840
Thank you.

48:52.920 --> 48:54.200
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

48:54.240 --> 48:55.360
My sister and I
both thank you.

48:55.440 --> 48:56.600
Would you like to say
a few words, sweetheart?

48:56.680 --> 48:57.520
Yes.

48:57.600 --> 48:59.560
Thank you. That's enough.

48:59.640 --> 49:01.520
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen,
for the piece de résistance.</i>

49:01.600 --> 49:02.840
We're supposed
to add a new song

49:02.880 --> 49:03.840
to our act
for next season,

49:03.920 --> 49:05.400
but the fella who was
supposed to sing it

49:05.440 --> 49:06.640
got himself a new job.

49:06.720 --> 49:08.960
It's not as much money
as we were paying him,

49:09.000 --> 49:10.160
but that's
what he wants to do,

49:10.240 --> 49:13.320
so we're all for him.
Would you like to hear it?

49:18.200 --> 49:19.640
Ladies and gentlemen,

49:19.680 --> 49:22.320
your guest of honor,
Mr. Steven Donahue.

49:24.160 --> 49:27.000
Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago,

49:27.040 --> 49:28.760
when we were
playing down in Memphis,

49:28.840 --> 49:31.120
I heard a song
that impressed me very much,

49:31.160 --> 49:32.720
and it's
the kind of a song

49:32.800 --> 49:34.800
we snap our fingers
and clap our hands,

49:34.880 --> 49:36.960
and I want you
to come along with me.

49:37.040 --> 49:38.360
We'll have a little fun.

49:38.440 --> 49:39.840
# Brothers #

49:41.280 --> 49:43.120
# And sisters #

49:44.320 --> 49:45.720
# Listen #

49:45.800 --> 49:48.360
# You non-believers, listen #

49:48.440 --> 49:50.960
# You better
start to believe #

49:51.000 --> 49:53.440
# All you doubters #

49:53.520 --> 49:55.920
# Be hallelujah shouters #

49:55.960 --> 49:58.760
# Or else
you're going to grieve #

50:00.360 --> 50:04.920
# There's no time to wait #

50:05.000 --> 50:10.040
# You may be too late #

50:10.080 --> 50:12.280
# So listen #

50:12.360 --> 50:15.160
# You don't know
what you're missin' #

50:15.240 --> 50:22.840
# Until you
start to believe #

50:25.560 --> 50:29.040
# If you believe #

50:29.120 --> 50:32.920
# That there's a heaven #

50:32.960 --> 50:36.280
# You'll get to heaven #

50:36.320 --> 50:40.960
# If you believe #

50:42.360 --> 50:48.440
# If you believe
that there are angels #

50:48.480 --> 50:52.120
# You'll see the angels #

50:52.200 --> 50:55.640
# If you believe #

50:56.680 --> 51:01.280
# I'm not making promises #

51:01.360 --> 51:08.840
# To the doubting Thomases #

51:08.920 --> 51:16.720
# But if you believe
the Lord can help you #

51:16.760 --> 51:22.360
# The Lord will help you #

51:22.440 --> 51:28.880
# If you believe #

51:28.920 --> 51:31.080
# Do you believe? #

51:31.160 --> 51:32.120
# We do,
we do, we do #

51:32.200 --> 51:33.360
# Do you believe? #

51:33.440 --> 51:34.680
# We do,
we do, we do #

51:34.760 --> 51:37.600
# Well, Jonah went out
one night in a gale #

51:37.680 --> 51:38.600
# Do you believe that? #

51:38.680 --> 51:40.520
# We do, we do, we do #

51:40.600 --> 51:42.960
# Soon he was
swallowed up by a whale #

51:43.000 --> 51:44.320
# Do you believe that? #

51:44.400 --> 51:45.920
# We do,
we do, we do #

51:46.000 --> 51:48.360
# Daniel laid down
with lions that roared #

51:48.440 --> 51:51.160
# Noah was on his ark
when it poured #

51:51.200 --> 51:53.440
# Moses looked up,
and he spoke to the Lord #

51:53.520 --> 51:54.640
# Do you believe that? #

51:54.720 --> 51:56.120
# Do you believe that? #

51:56.200 --> 51:57.080
# We do #

51:57.160 --> 51:58.520
# We do,
we do, we do #

51:58.560 --> 52:05.920
# Now, I'm not making promises #

52:06.000 --> 52:15.320
# To the doubting Thomases #

52:15.400 --> 52:23.560
# But if you believe
the Lord can help you #

52:23.640 --> 52:31.560
# The Lord will help you #

52:31.640 --> 52:43.480
# If you believe #

52:43.560 --> 52:45.080
More! More!

52:45.160 --> 52:47.000
More! More!

52:51.000 --> 52:52.400
Thank you very much.

52:52.440 --> 52:55.160
I hope you won't take this
as my farewell performance.

52:55.240 --> 52:57.760
I'm just going into rehearsal
now for four years,

52:57.840 --> 52:59.800
and when I get
the new act put together--

52:59.880 --> 53:02.640
New material, new costumes--
I hope you'll all

53:02.680 --> 53:04.400
find the time
to come and see me.

53:04.440 --> 53:05.360
Will you?

53:15.320 --> 53:16.880
Thank you.

53:16.920 --> 53:20.760
We're going
to miss you around here.

53:22.040 --> 53:26.200
Somebody put a slice of
raw onion in this sandwich.

53:26.280 --> 53:27.520
You better
give me a bite.

53:27.600 --> 53:29.160
I need an excuse, too.

53:33.720 --> 53:34.960
Florida.

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
We now take you
to beautiful Florida,

53:38.080 --> 53:41.520
land of golden sunshine,
balmy breezes,

53:41.600 --> 53:44.520
swaying palm trees.

53:44.560 --> 53:46.920
Playground
of the millionaires.

53:46.960 --> 53:49.600
Yeah. Things
were going so swimmingly

53:49.680 --> 53:50.920
for The Four Donahues,

53:50.960 --> 53:53.160
one winter, we even
vacationed there.

53:53.200 --> 53:54.520
Some vacation.

53:54.600 --> 53:57.840
Two shows a night.
Three on Saturdays.

54:03.160 --> 54:04.680
# Ta-da-da-da-da-ta #

54:04.760 --> 54:06.960
# Tropical heat wave #

54:07.040 --> 54:07.920
# Da-da-da-da-ta #

54:08.000 --> 54:10.840
# Da-da-da-da-ta,
bum-bum #

54:10.920 --> 54:12.480
Your aim's gettin' better.

54:12.560 --> 54:13.800
I take it those
are the new costumes

54:13.840 --> 54:14.760
<i>for the Heat Wave
number.</i>

54:14.800 --> 54:15.880
Yeah. Cuban. You like?

54:15.920 --> 54:16.880
Yeah.

54:16.920 --> 54:17.840
You better.
They cost a week's salary.

54:17.880 --> 54:18.800
A week's salary?

54:18.880 --> 54:20.160
If the number
doesn't go,

54:20.240 --> 54:21.120
we can always
eat the act.

54:21.200 --> 54:22.120
Take your hands away.

54:22.160 --> 54:24.200
Those grapes cost
a dollar a piece.

54:24.240 --> 54:26.240
<i>Muchachas, we are
in the wrong business.</i>

54:26.320 --> 54:28.560
Oh, take the arrangements
down to the band

54:28.640 --> 54:29.520
and go over
the routine with them

54:29.600 --> 54:30.480
before we rehearse.

54:30.560 --> 54:31.440
OK, Mom.

54:31.520 --> 54:33.440
If you see Katy,
send her in here.

54:33.520 --> 54:35.360
All right.

54:39.760 --> 54:41.320
Hold it, fellas.

54:41.360 --> 54:43.320
Mac, would mind trying
the vocal with me first?

54:43.400 --> 54:45.400
Just easy, you know?
When the boys get here,

54:45.480 --> 54:46.400
we can
take it from the top.

54:46.480 --> 54:48.000
OK, honey. Let's try it.

54:48.080 --> 54:49.200
Hi, Tim.

54:49.280 --> 54:50.160
Hi.

54:50.240 --> 54:51.920
Vicky, do you know
Tim Donahue?

54:52.000 --> 54:53.480
Miss Vicky Parker.

54:53.560 --> 54:55.600
Hello, Mr. Donahue.

54:55.680 --> 54:57.680
Victoria Hoffman--
Gallagher's.

54:57.760 --> 54:58.720
Right.

54:58.800 --> 55:00.560
But he said
Vicky Parker.

55:00.600 --> 55:01.640
Don't tell me
you're married.

55:01.720 --> 55:02.640
Don't tell me

55:02.680 --> 55:04.400
this is going to be
another interview.

55:04.480 --> 55:05.480
Are you?

55:05.560 --> 55:07.560
Mac, did you know

55:07.640 --> 55:09.040
that Mr. Donahue,
in his spare time,

55:09.120 --> 55:10.200
is a well-known
reporter?

55:10.280 --> 55:11.840
- Yeah.
- Are ya?

55:11.920 --> 55:14.480
No, Mr. Donahue.
I have a new manager,

55:14.520 --> 55:15.920
and he's doing me
over completely.

55:15.960 --> 55:19.200
New name, new clothes,
new, uh...

55:19.280 --> 55:21.120
I guess everything else
is pretty much the same.

55:21.200 --> 55:24.720
Yeah. But my
sensitive ear tells me

55:24.800 --> 55:26.880
that you're not using
quite as much diaphragm.

55:26.960 --> 55:30.120
My vocal teacher
is gone with the wind,

55:30.160 --> 55:31.920
and please
don't remind me.

55:31.960 --> 55:34.400
Ah, dear. And I thought
this was just gonna be

55:34.480 --> 55:35.640
another
nightclub engagement.

55:39.760 --> 55:41.160
Thank you, fellas.

55:41.240 --> 55:42.760
I couldn't have said it
any better myself.

55:42.800 --> 55:44.560
Would you
mind terribly

55:44.640 --> 55:45.880
if we got on
with the rehearsal?

55:45.960 --> 55:47.360
Of course not.
You go right ahead.

55:47.440 --> 55:48.800
I'll just sit right here
and watch you.

55:48.880 --> 55:50.760
Help yourself.
Won't bother me.

55:50.840 --> 55:52.520
It'll bother me,
but I like it.

55:52.560 --> 55:53.680
OK, Mac.

55:57.720 --> 56:00.560
# We're havin' a heat wave #

56:02.800 --> 56:05.640
# A tropical heat wave #

56:05.680 --> 56:08.480
# The temperature's rising,
it isn't surprising #

56:08.560 --> 56:09.440
# She's certainly-- #

56:09.520 --> 56:10.800
Hold it.
Wait a second.

56:10.840 --> 56:12.760
Hold it, fellas. Hold it.

56:12.840 --> 56:14.040
This is terrible.

56:14.120 --> 56:15.000
Terrible?

56:15.080 --> 56:16.800
No, you don't understand.

56:16.880 --> 56:18.560
You can't
use that song.

56:18.640 --> 56:20.520
We're using it.
We have new costumes

56:20.600 --> 56:22.360
and new arrangements.
Well, it's all set.

56:22.440 --> 56:23.320
It's a big number.

56:23.400 --> 56:24.360
You're joking.

56:24.440 --> 56:25.680
I wish I was.

56:25.760 --> 56:28.080
<i>But Heat Wave's
my big number, too.</i>

56:28.120 --> 56:29.120
It is?

56:29.200 --> 56:30.600
What are
we going to do?

56:30.680 --> 56:32.320
My whole act's
built around it.

56:32.400 --> 56:34.680
I have boys
working with me...

56:34.760 --> 56:36.240
but of course,

56:36.320 --> 56:37.440
you're the headliners,

56:37.520 --> 56:39.080
so I guess it's out.

56:39.120 --> 56:40.560
I'll just have to cancel

56:40.600 --> 56:41.640
and go back
to New York.

56:41.680 --> 56:44.560
No, you can't do that.
What about us?

56:44.600 --> 56:45.920
What about all the things
we're gonna do together?

56:46.000 --> 56:47.840
But, Tim,
what else can I do?

56:47.920 --> 56:49.800
It puts me
in a terrible spot.

56:49.840 --> 56:51.080
Well--

56:53.560 --> 56:55.280
I'll tell you what,
forget about it.

56:55.360 --> 56:56.680
Forget the whole thing.
You go right ahead.

56:56.720 --> 56:59.240
It's your number. There are
lots of things we can do.

56:59.280 --> 57:01.040
We'll work something out.
I'll go talk to the family.

57:01.120 --> 57:02.440
I'll see you later.

57:02.480 --> 57:04.600
I hope so.
And thank you.

57:04.680 --> 57:06.520
Yeah.
I'll see you later.

57:11.640 --> 57:14.040
Whew. That was close.
He had me worried.

57:14.120 --> 57:16.000
Not me. I never had
a moment's doubt.

57:16.080 --> 57:18.880
Gentlemen, the winner
and new champion.

57:45.640 --> 57:46.720
Wow!

57:47.880 --> 57:50.000
# We're havin' a heat wave #

57:50.040 --> 57:52.240
# A tropical heat wave #

57:52.280 --> 57:54.400
# The temperature's rising,
it isn't surprising #

57:54.480 --> 57:56.040
# She certainly can #

57:56.120 --> 57:57.040
# Can-can #

57:58.640 --> 58:00.680
# She started a heat wave #

58:00.720 --> 58:02.880
# By letting her seat wave #

58:02.960 --> 58:05.000
# In such a way that
the customers say that #

58:05.040 --> 58:06.320
# She certainly can #

58:06.400 --> 58:07.280
# Can-can #

58:07.360 --> 58:08.640
# Gee, gee #

58:08.720 --> 58:10.440
# Her anatomy #

58:10.480 --> 58:12.480
# Makes the mercury #

58:12.560 --> 58:13.480
# Zoom #

58:13.520 --> 58:15.440
# To 93 #

58:16.840 --> 58:19.240
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

58:19.320 --> 58:21.280
# We're havin' a heat wave #

58:21.360 --> 58:23.320
# A tropical heat wave #

58:23.400 --> 58:25.160
# The way that she moves
that thermometer proves #

58:25.200 --> 58:26.240
# That she certainly can #

58:26.320 --> 58:27.720
What's your name, honey?

58:27.800 --> 58:28.720
Pablo.

58:28.760 --> 58:29.800
# Certainly can #

58:29.840 --> 58:30.760
Chico.

58:30.800 --> 58:31.880
# Certainly can #

58:31.960 --> 58:32.880

58:34.800 --> 58:35.800

58:36.960 --> 58:37.840

58:40.160 --> 58:42.080

59:17.840 --> 59:18.760
# Where? #

59:18.800 --> 59:19.880
# Jamaica #

59:19.960 --> 59:21.440
# Moderately high
barometric pressure #

59:21.520 --> 59:23.680
# Will cover
the, uh, Northeast and #

59:23.760 --> 59:24.640
# Where else? #

59:24.720 --> 59:26.440
# The deep South #

59:26.480 --> 59:27.480
# Small danger of #

59:27.560 --> 59:28.440
# What? #

59:28.520 --> 59:29.680
# Fruit frost #

59:29.720 --> 59:32.640
# Hot and humid nights

# St. Vincent, 95 #

# Guadeloupe, 97 #

# Martinique #

59:42.840 --> 59:47.240
# We're havin' a heat wave #

59:47.320 --> 59:49.400
# A tropical #

59:49.480 --> 59:52.160
# Heat wave #

59:52.240 --> 59:54.960
# The temperature's rising #

59:55.040 --> 59:57.360
# It isn't surprising #

59:57.400 --> 59:59.360
# He certainly can #

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:02.160
# Can #

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:07.600
# I started this heat wave #

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:08.560
# By #

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.600
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.920
# And in such a way that #

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:17.760
# The customers say that #

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.880

# Can-can #

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:26.240
# Gee, gee, gee... #

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:27.960
It's easy to see
why he did it.

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:28.920
Ow!

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.040
# Makes the mercury #

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:35.280
# Rise to #

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:37.200
# 93 #

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:43.680
# We're havin' a heat wave #

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:48.040
# A tropical, tropical
heat wave #

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:52.200
# The way that I move
that thermometer proves #

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.360
# She certainly #

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:56.120
# Certainly,
certainly can #

01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:00.120
# I certainly, certainly,
certainly can #

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:09.400
# Can-can #

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.920
Yeah? Then
what happened?

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.320
Then after Lew Harris bought
my contract from Eddie,

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.440
he sent me out on the road
for a few seasons.

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:26.280
He told me I had
an awful lot to learn

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.840
and I talked as if I had
marshmallows in my mouth.

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:31.080
Ha. I liked it.
It was different.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.760
Yes, like green hair.

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.400
Yeah.

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:36.640
It's lovely.

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:37.600
You know,

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.560
I never thought
anything like this

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.080
could ever happen
to me.

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.480
Well, anyway...

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:44.680
I guess Lew thinks
I'm ready now.

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:46.280
He's planning to build
a whole new revue

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:47.640
around me next season
on Broadway.

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:49.800
I'd like to build
something around you:

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.280
A barbed-wire fence.

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.440
Where do you think

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:53.800
we should go
on our honeymoon?

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:54.760
What?

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.760
I think we oughta
stay right here.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.160
Then we wouldn't waste
all that time traveling,

01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.200
and, besides,

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.880
they tell me the rainy
season's coming on.

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.840
I really have to go, Tim.

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:05.840
It's getting late.

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:07.280
Why don't we get
a sandwich at the hotel?

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:08.320
I'm hungry.

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.080
We just had spaghetti
at the other place.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.000
You bought me
breadsticks, remember?

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:13.840
Huh? Yeah. I forgot.

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:16.080
Well, when we're married,
we won't eat out.

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:17.520
We'll bake
our own breadsticks.

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.680
Grow our own wheat?

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:21.320
Sure. With a large family,
you gotta cut corners.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.280
Just how large a family
are you planning?

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:25.680
Oh, quartet:
Baritone, tenor,

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:26.960
soprano, alto.

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.880
You like the script so far?

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:31.080
You left out
a very important part:

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.040
The menace.

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.120
Oh, we don't need one.

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:35.480
We'll keep it
light and airy.

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:37.280
What if your heroine
is a career woman,

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:39.720
gonna fight her way to
the top, no matter what?

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:41.280
Then I'll clear
the path for her.

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:42.240
Why, I'm...

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:44.320
trustworthy,
loyal, helpful,

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.280
friendly, courteous,
kind, obedient,

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:47.240
cheerful, thrifty,

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:48.840
brave, clean,
and reverent,

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.760
and we could
start a fire

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.160
without rubbing
two sticks together.

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:54.240
What do you say, baby?

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:56.080
Don't call us.
We'll call you.

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:00.440
Good night, Tim.

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:02.360
Is that all?

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:03.320
Good night.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.120
Oh, I forgot to return
your breadstick.

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.560
I'm awfully sorry.

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.080
I'll forgive you.

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:29.080
Good night.

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.480
Is that still all?

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:32.920
Tim, I had
a wonderful evening.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.360
I like you very much.

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:36.520
I hope you ask me out
again sometime.

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.280
And if you want
to kiss me good night...

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:39.240
Mm-hmm.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:45.440
Good night.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:07.120
# A man chases a girl #

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:09.480
# Until she catches him #

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:14.800
# He runs after a girl #

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:16.240
# Until he's caught #

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:20.640
# He fishes for a girl #

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:23.080
# Until she's landed him #

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:28.360
# It all comes out exactly
the way she thought #

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.320
# Uncertain #

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:36.520
# He tags along behind #

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:39.360
# Uncertain #

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:42.480
# Till she
makes up his mind #

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:49.000
# A man chases a girl
until she catches him #

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:54.920
# But don't run too fast
while you are saying no #

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:56.720
# And once
you've caught him #

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:59.400
# Don't ever let him go #

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:38.000
# A man chases a girl #

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:40.800
# Until she catches him #

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.600
# He runs after a girl #

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:47.560
# Until he's caught #

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:51.120
# He fishes for a girl #

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:54.480
# Until she's landed him #

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:58.080
# It all comes out #

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:00.600
# Exactly the way
she thought #

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:27.520
# Once you've got him #

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:31.080
# Don't ever let him #

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:32.880
# Once you've got him #

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:36.040
# Don't ever let him #

# Don't let him go #

01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:59.439
"Well, Mom, Latin and I are
finally on speaking terms,

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:00.560
"and I am not as worried

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:02.120
"about the final
examinations now

"as I was a month ago.

"However, I'll be grateful

"Please light
four candles for me.

"I miss you all very much.

"Love, Steve.

<i>"Pax vobiscum.</i>

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:16.840
<i>That's Latin
for "peace be with you."</i>

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:17.800
Let me see that.

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:19.120
You know, it
wouldn't surprise me

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:20.560
if he was top man
in his class.

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:21.600
Morning, Pop.

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.160
Morning, Mom.

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:24.120
Would you like

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.920
to try
that entrance again?

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:26.880
See, I'm your father.

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:27.960
This lady happens
to be your mother.

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:29.040
Leave him alone, Terry.

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:31.200
He hasn't got anything
straight for two weeks.

01:09:31.279 --> 01:09:33.120
Why should he start now?

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:34.080
What's up?

01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:36.200
Let him eat.
He needs his strength.

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:38.800
I'll get it.

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:42.600
Hello.

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:45.080
Yes, he's here.

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:47.000
That girl who steals
everybody's material

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:48.200
wants to talk to you.

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:49.479
Shh!

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:50.479
She'll hear you.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:53.120
Good. Maybe she'll
give me back my song.

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:55.800
Hello, Vicky.

01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:57.160
How are you
this morning?

01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:58.600
Hmm?

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:00.200
Yeah, it's me.

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:02.000
No, really.

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:03.440
No--no--no--no,

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:04.400
there's
nothing wrong.

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:05.880
It's just--yeah.

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:06.920
Yeah, capacity.

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:08.360
Standing room only.

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:12.360
No, I haven't
had a chance

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.080
to tell them yet.
I--I--I--

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:15.040
Excuse me.

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:16.200
Wait just a minute,
will ya, Vicky?

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:17.640
Excuse me, Mother.

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.000
Uh, excuse me.

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:26.080
You know something?
I think they're married.

01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:27.080
Married? Who?

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.560
Tim and that girl.
Didn't you hear him?

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:29.680
"I haven't had a chance
to tell them yet."

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:30.640
What else could it be?

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:31.640
No, no, no.

01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:33.240
What do you mean,
"no, no, no"?

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.440
Of course that's
what it is.

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:35.440
What are we gonna do?

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:36.600
They're not married.

01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:37.560
Then they're making plans.

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:39.040
You've gotta step 'em,
Terry.

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.000
Me?

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:40.960
Certainly. You run this act.

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.000
Ha! All of a sudden,

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:43.360
when something goes
wrong, I run the act.

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:44.680
Don't raise your voice
to me!

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:45.640
What do you
think you are,

01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:46.600
Whispering
Jack Smith?

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:48.520
Come in.

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.800
Oh, it's love's
young dream.

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:53.240
He locked himself in.

01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.680
There's no knob
on the inside.

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:02.160
I'll complain
to the management.

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:05.200
Tell them and get it
over with, will ya?

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:06.880
OK.

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:08.920
Uh, Mom, Pop...

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.600
uh, Katy and me,
we, uh--

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:13.080
Well, me and Katy--

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:14.240
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.040
Lew Harris is going
to star Vicky Parker

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:17.800
in a big Broadway revue
next season--

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:19.080
I got a great title
for it:

01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:21.000
<i>Something Borrowed
And Something Blue.</i>

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:22.640
Now, come on, Mom.
Let Katy tell you, will ya?

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:24.040
Well, Vicky wants
Tim and me

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:25.400
to be in the show
with her,

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:26.360
so she asked Mr. Harris

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:27.480
to catch the act
last night,

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:28.760
and he liked us,

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:30.120
so he wants to sign us.

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:33.000
And the question is,
should we or...

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.360
or shouldn't we do it?

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:39.960
First she takes our song,
and now...

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:41.440
Oh, this kid and I

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:44.520
have just gotta wind up
the best of chums.

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:46.000
Well, I think
it's great.

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.200
I think it's
just wonderful.

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:50.640
Now, you understand
it's just Katy and me.

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:52.680
That's why we didn't
say anything definite.

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:54.400
Are you worrying about
your mother and me?

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:55.600
Young lady,
we were an act

01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:57.360
before you
were an idea.

01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:59.920
And you, you weren't
even penciled in.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.480
What do you think
we raised you for

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:02.920
if it wasn't for this?

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.760
What do you say, Mom?

01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:07.160
OK.

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:09.880
On one condition.

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:12.440
They have to take
the four Cuban costumes, too.

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:14.280
Molly, I love you.

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:19.280

01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:06.600
# Go drifting by #

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:08.920
# I wanna peep #

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.800
# Through the deep #

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:16.080
# Tangled wide world #

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:20.440
# Counting sheep #

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:23.640
# Till I sleep #

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:29.200
# Like a child would #

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:35.560
# With a great big
valise full #

01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:38.880
# Of books to read #

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:43.360
# Where it's peaceful #

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:45.840
# While I'm #

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:48.800
# Killin' time #

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:52.760
# Being lazy #

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.160
Wrong number.

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:14.560
Wrong number.

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:24.200
Oh, Sam,
you're sweet.

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.200
Aah!

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:43.600
Lew, I did
that lyric over.

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:45.040
You want to look at it?

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:46.600
Oh, thanks, Charlie.

01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:49.480
That boy and girl are
just what Vicky needed.

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:50.840
They make her look great.

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:52.960
Yeah, they sure do.

01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:54.400
You know something, Lew?

01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:57.360
I think I'm gonna
marry that girl.

01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:58.520
You what?

01:16:58.560 --> 01:16:59.960
Don't get nervous.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.400
I mean
the little Donahue.

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:02.400
Oh.

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:21.720
# With a great big #

01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:24.920
# Valise full #

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:29.000
# Of books to read #

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:34.000
# Where it's peaceful #

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:36.720
# While I'm #

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:40.720
# Killin' time #

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:43.600
# Being #

01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:50.320
# Lazy #

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:01.400
That's fine, kids.
Very good. Keep it that way.

01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:02.360
Let's go to lunch.

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:03.440
OK, kids, that's it.

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:05.320
Lunch, everybody.
Back at 2:00 sharp.

01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:06.680
I'm starved.
I'll get my coat

01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:07.920
and be with you
in two minutes.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:08.880
All right.

01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:10.320
Tim, toward the finish

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:12.320
where I slide over
the end of the couch,

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.160
am I too close to you?

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.120
Can the bee get too close
to the honey?

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.120
Come on.
Let's go to lunch.

01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:19.120
Vicky, I have lunch
sent upstairs for us.

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:20.920
I think that'll
be less tiring for you.

01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:22.000
We can't take
any chances

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:23.080
with our star,
you know?

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:24.480
Can I have
a rain check, Tim?

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:25.440
Maybe tomorrow, huh?

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:26.600
That dance looked great.

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:27.800
Nice work, boy.

01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:33.040
Boy, you can
take me to lunch.

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:35.760
Come on.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.880
Oh, by the way,
I fixed it.

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:39.800
We've got Friday off.

01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:41.560
Yeah? Where are we going?

01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:43.520
To church.
Steve is being ordained.

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:45.440
How could you
forget that?

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:46.840
Honestly, Tim,
don't you think

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:49.240
about anything these days
but Vicky Parker?

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:50.200
No.

01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:51.440
Miss Donahue.

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:52.400
Oh, hello.

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:53.840
Excuse me.
I was just wondering

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:55.160
if you were free
for lunch.

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:56.680
Well, um...

01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:58.440
Oh, don't worry
about me, Sis.

01:18:58.520 --> 01:18:59.400
Of course,
I'm not sincere,

01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:00.800
but would you
like to join us?

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.240
Well, thanks,
but I'll send out

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.720
for a sandwich.
You go ahead.

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:05.240
Be sure and eat, now.

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:07.120
You really looked like you
were enjoying that number.

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:08.560
I love it.

01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:59.160
But when I got up
to the altar,

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:00.640
I was real scared.

01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:02.960
The ordaining was
so beautiful, Steve.

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:04.160
Father Donahue.

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:06.080
Hey, you know where
your parish will be?

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:07.320
I haven't been
assigned yet.

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:09.240
You make sure they give
you a good booking, son.

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:11.240
Don't let them put you
out in the sticks.

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:13.240
Oh, Charlie,
I'm sorry.

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:15.160
Steve, you haven't
met Charlie Gibbs.

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:17.560
Charlie, may I present
Father Steven Donahue?

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:18.560
Glad to meet you,
Charlie.

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:19.520
Congratulations,
Father.

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:20.480
Thank you.

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:21.920
Look, I know
this is family,

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:23.400
and I kind of hate
to butt in,

01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:24.920
but I was wondering
if you'd have any time

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.120
in the near future

01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:27.280
to perform a small
wedding ceremony.

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:28.240
A wedding ceremony?

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:29.200
That's right.

01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:30.720
Who are you
gonna marry, Charlie?

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:32.440
You.

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:33.440
What is this?

01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:34.560
When did
all this happen?

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:36.000
It's the first
I've heard of it.

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:39.360
It's the first I've
heard of it, too. Charlie.

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:41.880
Well, it looks like it's
my turn to congratulate you.

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:43.680
I'll be happy
to perform the ceremony.

01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:44.640
Thanks, Father.

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:46.320
Wherever you are,
whenever you're ready,

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:47.680
just give me a call.

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:49.600
Have black suit,
will travel.

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.240
I think I oughta
congratulate him, too.

01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:52.800
I'm gonna give
the bride away.

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.000
Tim?

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:00.960
Yeah. Ready?

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:03.480
I have the evening
all planned.

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:04.840
Dinner at Shambor.

01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:06.720
Pheasant under glass,
broccoli hollandaise.

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:07.680
Not for me.

01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:09.720
I'm a simple girl
with simple tastes.

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:11.280
2-inch-thick steaks,
French fries,

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:12.240
and a big salad.

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:14.120
Then steak it'll be.
Hitch on.

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:18.040
Nellie, what is that?

01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:19.040
That's not for me.

01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:20.120
Well, yes, Miss Parker.

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:21.600
It's the first dress
you wear.

01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:22.920
But I understood
it was out.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:23.880
Well, I don't know.

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:24.920
Mr. Harris put it through.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.040
He wants to see it

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:27.280
in his office right now.

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:29.960
Then I have to see him
right now. Thanks, Millie.

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:31.000
Hey, Vicky.

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:32.600
Steak, French fries,
you and me, remember?

01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:33.600
You go ahead, Tim.

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:34.680
I thought
I'd convinced Lew

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:35.840
this dress
is wrong for me,

01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:37.760
but I guess I'll have
to persuade him again.

01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:38.720
It won't take long.

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:39.880
I'll join you
at the restaurant.

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:41.840
I'll give you
exactly 20 minutes.

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:43.320
I'll be there just
as soon as I can.

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.320
I promise.

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.960
All right, honey,
but don't be long, huh?

01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:46.920
I won't.

01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:52.600
Night, Kelly.

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:53.800
Good night.

01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:55.080
I still can't see

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:56.400
anything wrong
with it.

01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:57.760
Lew, it's my first entrance.

01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:59.120
I have to make
an impression,

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:00.560
and this dress
won't do it.

01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:02.400
This shade of purple
is wrong for me.

01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:04.440
The color is heliotrope.

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:06.520
Heliotrope, hydrangea,
petunia,

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:07.640
whatever you call it,

01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:09.400
it's still the wrong shade
of purple for me.

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:10.840
Hey, kids,
simmer down.

01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:11.920
For two solid hours,

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.160
I haven't been
a producer.

01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:14.600
I've been a referee.

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:16.280
Lew, it's as simple
as this:

01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:18.080
Do you want me
to look right in this show?

01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:19.600
Everyone else thinks
it looks wonderful.

01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:21.440
She doesn't like it
because it's classic.

01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:22.880
In color, in line,

01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:24.320
in everything,
it's different.

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:25.760
It's different, all right.

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:27.480
Different from anything
I'm going to wear.

01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:28.560
Let's be practical.

01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:30.000
The dress cost $1,400,

01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:31.440
and that's not heliotrope.

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:35.200
Yes?

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:36.920
Oh. Just a minute.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.840
Did you have a date
with young Donahue?

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:40.640
Poor Tim.
What time is it?

01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:41.600
Oh, no.

01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:45.080
Hello, Tim.

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:46.680
I'm terribly sorry.

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:48.640
It's taking longer
than I thought.

01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:51.200
Yes, I know, but--

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:53.600
Look, why don't you
start your dinner?

01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:54.760
I won't be long.

01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:56.520
I will. Bye.

01:22:58.400 --> 01:22:59.800
- Now--
- Oh, now--

01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:01.480
4th round,
coming up.

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:03.400
Oh, this whole argument's
ridiculous.

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:42.680
Are we alive,
or are we dead?

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:47.640
Just as I thought. Dead.

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:50.760
Well, as long
as we're not on the air,

01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:52.200
I can speak freely.

01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:53.640
The time is now...

01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:58.720
12:31 A.M.

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.360
It's tomorrow morning.

01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:01.760
First the news.

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:06.800
The news is all bad,
so we'll skip it.

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:08.240
Instead, we'll bring you

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:10.640
the musical portion
of our program.

01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:20.200
I would like
to dedicate this number

01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:23.440
to a little girl who's
about to become a big star

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:26.400
because she knows
exactly where she's going

01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:28.840
and who she's
going there with.

01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:32.920
<i>With whom
she's going there...</i>

01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:33.880
with?

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:38.000
Anyway, I dedicate
this next number to her

01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:39.760
and to me, too, because...

01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:41.160
I ain't goin' there
with her.

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:44.080
Well, hello,
Miss Vicky Parker.

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:45.440
I'm terribly sorry, Tim.

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:46.560
Speak up.

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:48.040
I had no idea Geoffrey
was going to be there

01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:49.640
and that we would get
into such a big hassle.

01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:51.560
Oh, Geoffrey
was there, too?

01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:53.200
Well, well...
Geoffrey!

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:55.800
Geoffrey. Geoffrey.
Here, Geoffrey.

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:58.280
I don't see him.
Do you see him?

01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:00.360
However, just because
I can't see him

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:02.120
doesn't mean
he wasn't there.

01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:04.040
Of course, I can't
see anything. No.

01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:05.800
Things can be right
in front of my nose,

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:07.000
and I can't see them.

01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:08.040
What things?

01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:10.960
You want me
to spell it out for you?

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:11.920
No.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.520
Maybe it's crazy to try and
explain anything to you

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:17.440
the way you are now,

01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:19.120
but, Tim,
try to understand,

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:21.920
to you, this is
just another show.

01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:23.360
You're part
of this business.

01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:24.880
You were born to it.

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:27.280
You never had
to pound on doors

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:29.600
to get people
to listen to you.

01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:31.520
Your family did it all.

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:32.960
It's different with me.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.160
I've been on my own
since I was 15.

01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:38.240
This show is
my big chance.

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:39.720
It's make or break.

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:42.560
Don't worry, honey.
You'll make it.

01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:44.240
You've got what it takes,

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:47.120
and you know
how to use it.

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:49.960
I don't have to take
that from you, Tim.

01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:51.480
Why should I?

01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:54.120
I don't owe you a thing.

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:56.040
That's right.
You don't.

01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:57.560
You only owe Lew Harris.

01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:59.000
You owe him everything.

01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:00.920
And let it not be said

01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:03.320
that you're a girl
who welches on her debts.

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:04.280
Get out.

01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:06.960
Get out of here!

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.640
Did you send
the flowers?

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:31.880
Molly, for the 40th time,
yes, I sent the flowers.

01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:33.960
The florist said they'd
be at the theater by 7:30.

01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:35.120
And what about
the reservation

01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:36.240
at 21 for after the show?

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:37.240
Yes, I made it, Molly.

01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:38.240
Now, will you calm down?

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:39.400
You'd think it was
our opening night.

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:41.520
I wish it was.
Those poor kids.

01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:43.400
Oh, just another show.
They'll be great.

01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:47.080
Hello.

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:48.560
Hello?

01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:50.560
Katy?

01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:52.040
What's the matter,
honey?

01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:54.040
You sound
like you're crying.

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:57.280
What? No. Where?

01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:59.240
Well, is he hurt bad?

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:00.880
Who? Who's hurt?

01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:03.160
Was there anybody
with him?

01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:04.160
Oh, I see.

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:05.120
Is it Tim?

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:06.080
Yes, but he's
not hurt bad.

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:07.200
He's just banged up
a little.

01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:09.880
Look, Katy, I'm gonna
go right out there.

01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:11.800
What hospital
did you say?

01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:13.240
Yeah, I got that.
Uh-huh.

01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:14.240
Now, look, honey...

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:15.440
Now, you stop crying

01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:16.640
and get hold
of yourself,

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:17.760
and I'll send Mother

01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:19.240
down to the theater
right away.

01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:21.320
Yes, I'm leaving
this minute. Right.

01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:22.280
All right, honey.
Good-bye.

01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:23.720
What is it?
What happened?

01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:24.840
He was with one
of the chorus girls,

01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:26.240
and the car
turned over.

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:27.560
Katy said
he'd been drinking

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:28.760
up in White Plains
somewhere.

01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:30.440
Are you sure
he's not badly hurt?

01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:31.720
Katy said no.

01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:33.560
What about the show tonight?
Why would Tim--

01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:36.560
Now, look, you get a cab
right away, will ya?

01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:38.600
Go to the theater.
Katy needs you.

01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:41.120
Will you call me
the minute you see him?

01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:42.440
Yes, I will,
and don't worry.

01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:49.400
Taxi. Taxi.

01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:51.520
We'll just have to
cut it, that's all.

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:53.080
But you can't cut
that number, Lew.

01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:54.560
That's Katy's best spot
in the show.

01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:56.640
But, Mom, the understudy
can't do it like Tim.

01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:57.640
Wouldn't mean a thing.

01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:58.600
He can get away

01:27:58.640 --> 01:27:59.560
with some
of the routines,

01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:00.520
but not that number.

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:01.480
I don't know.

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:02.920
Maybe
the best thing to do

01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:04.040
would be
to postpone.

01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:05.840
Lew, why don't I
do it with her?

01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:06.960
You?

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:08.520
Sure. I've been rehearsing
with her every night.

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:09.480
I know it backwards.

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:10.560
Oh, Molly, that's crazy.

01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:12.000
I'm telling you,
it'll work.

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:13.120
I'll have to fake
the dancing,

01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:14.720
but I've been getting away
with that for years.

01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:16.440
You think you can
go out there cold

01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:17.680
and sell that number
with Katy?

01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:20.080
No, I'm just talking.
Of course I could.

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:21.880
Why not, Lew? Why not?

01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:23.440
OK, Molly.
You're on.

01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:24.400
You're hired.

01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:26.280
Get the wardrobe
mistress up here.

01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:27.360
Charlie, take them
to the green room.

01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:28.480
I'll send
the orchestra leader

01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:29.440
right down.

01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:30.920
Me and my big mouth.

01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:31.880
All right, everybody,

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:33.040
what are you standing
around here for?

01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:35.080
Let's go. We've got
a show to do.

01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:00.280
# I'm an old salt #

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:02.040
# I'm a young salt #

01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:03.080
# In the navy #

01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:05.640
# We've been working
very hard #

01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:08.440
# I was part
of that flotilla #

01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:11.040
# With Dewey in Manila #

01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:12.360
# I'm a new recruit #

01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:14.080
# At the Brooklyn
Navy Yard #

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:21.880
# Tonight we're on a spree
and feeling flowery #

01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:25.600
# We've got a date with gals
and drinks and food #

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:29.280
# Across
the Brooklyn Bridge #

01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:31.800
# Into the bowery #

01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:35.200
# And I'm gonna get
the kid tattooed #

01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:37.720
Tattooed?

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:40.120
Tattooed.

01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:44.200
# A sailor's
not a sailor #

01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:47.320
# Till a sailor's been #

01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:50.040
# Tattooed #

01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:55.040
# Here's an anchor #

01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:57.000
# From a tanker #

01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:58.360
# That I sailed upon #

01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:00.560
# When first
I went to sea #

01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:02.320
# Here's another #

01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:04.160
# Of my mother #

01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:06.960
# Takes me back to when
I sat upon her knee #

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.640
# Here's a crimson heart #

01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:12.960
# With a cupid's dart #

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.520
# Here's a battle cruiser #

01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:16.920
# And when
I sit down #

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.760
# On that, too #

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:20.400
# There's a tattoo #

01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:23.920
# Of my hometown #

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.640
# To the bowery #

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:27.400
# To the bowery #

01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:28.600
# Cross the Brooklyn Bridge #

01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:30.800
# And I'm just
in the mood #

01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:32.880
# He'll be filled
with different mixtures #

01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:34.320
# And covered up
with pictures #

01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:35.400
# I can't wait to be #

01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:37.640
# It'll be great
to be tattooed #

01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:39.360
# Tattooed #

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:41.040
# Tattooed #

01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:44.400
# A sailor's not a sailor #

01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:47.960
# Till a sailor's been #

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.680
# Ta-a-a-ttooed #

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:04.080
# Tattooed #

01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:05.040
# Tattooed #

01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:06.000
# Tattooed #

01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:07.280
# Tattooed #

01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:10.240
# A sailor's not a sailor #

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:16.040
# Till a sailor's
been tattooed #

01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:34.080
# Oh, a sailor's
not a sailor #

01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:38.360
# Till a sailor's
been tattooed #

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:40.520
# Tattoo, tattoo #

01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:42.400
# A sailor's not a sailor #

01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:44.680
# Till he's been tattooed #

01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:33.200
# Tattooed #

01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:35.480
# Tattooed #

01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:37.440
# A sailor's not a sailor #

01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:39.480
# Till a sailor's been #

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:44.080
# Tattooed #

01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:12.960
Hiya, Pop.

01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:16.520
How's the girl?

01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:17.960
She's all right,
I guess. Uh...

01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:19.560
they had to take
a couple of stitches,

01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:21.160
but the doctor said
none of them would show.

01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:22.120
How 'bout you?

01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:23.480
I'm all right.
They, uh...

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:24.920
took a couple
of X-rays,

01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:26.320
just want me
to stay overnight

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:27.400
for observation.

01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:29.640
All right, let's have it.
What happened?

01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:31.160
Didn't they
tell you downstairs?

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:34.000
Yeah, they told me downstairs.
I'd like to hear it from you.

01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:36.640
OK, I was drunk.
I was loaded.

01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:38.600
The girl didn't like
the way I was driving,

01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:40.960
so she took the wheel,
and I passed out.

01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:42.760
Next thing I knew,
we were in a ditch,

01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:45.120
the car rolled over
a couple of times,

01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:47.760
and, uh...well, that's
about the whole story.

01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:48.960
Well, if you think
that's the whole story,

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:51.040
you got even
less sense than--

01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:52.800
You know, I thought
you were just a kid

01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:54.440
who got out of line
a few times.

01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:57.040
But you're not a kid anymore.
You know the score.

01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:58.800
Have you any idea
what you pulled tonight?

01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:00.280
What do you mean,
it's opening night,

01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:01.720
the show must go on,
that routine?

01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:03.760
No, no. They'll get
the show on without you.

01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:05.600
You're not that important.

01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:07.800
You didn't hurt anybody
tonight but yourself.

01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:10.040
All right. So I had
the chance of a lifetime,

01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:12.120
and I blew it, so what?

01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:14.000
What's got into you?

01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:15.680
Who do you think you are?

01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:17.040
I'll tell you what you are.

01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:19.080
You're nothing, because
you've made yourself nothing,

01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:20.520
you conceited little punk.

01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:22.440
I wouldn't care if I
never saw you again.

01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:23.680
Oh, come on now, Pop.

01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:25.920
I heard there's a big
crop of corn this year,

01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:26.960
- but--
- What?

01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:28.680
Corn. H-A-M. Corn.

01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:40.920
Did you put in
a clean shirt?

01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:42.040
Yeah. I got
everything he needs.

01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:43.320
Now, remember, when we
get to the hospital,

01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:45.200
you promised me not
to be tough with him.

01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:46.680
He's just no good,
Mother.

01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:47.880
You should've
heard him last night.

01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:49.320
But it's not all his fault.

01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:51.080
I found out a lot
of things last night.

01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:53.720
That Parker girl's been
giving him a rough time.

01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:55.760
I knew she was
no good for him.

01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:58.640
You can blame the girl,
but everybody else blames him.

01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:04.080
Are you gonna tell him

01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:05.960
that they want you
to stay in the show?

01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:07.920
Sure. It'll only
be a few days.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:08.920
It's down here.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.320
Oh.

01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:11.480
Can I help you?

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:13.160
I'm Mr. Donahue.
My son is in 4--

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:14.120
Oh! I--

01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:15.240
Is there
something wrong?

01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:16.760
Your son isn't here.

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:18.800
He seems to have picked
himself up last night

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:19.800
and walked out.

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:22.280
He left this note
for you.

01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:23.360
Thank you.

01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:32.200
"Dear folks,

01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:35.080
"I'm sorry I gave you
such a bad time.

01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:37.160
"I think Pop was right.

01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:39.640
"You'll all be
better off without me.

01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:42.040
"See you around
sometime.

01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:43.400
"Don't worry.

01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:44.920
Love, Tim."

01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:06.880
"Don't worry." Ha.

01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:08.120
That's a laugh.

01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:10.040
You start worrying
about your kids

01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:13.000
the day they're born,
and you never stop.

01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:15.920
Even after they bury you,
I bet you never stop.

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:19.480
Of course
we did everything

01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:21.680
we possibly could
to find him.

01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:24.120
Went to the police.

01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:27.440
Checked booking offices,
in case he tried to work.

01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:29.760
Even hired detectives
of our own.

01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:32.280
Once, later on,

01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:34.560
we heard he was working
under a different name

01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:37.040
with a trio down
in Greenwich Village.

01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:45.840
# Oh, Marie #

01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:47.320
# Time for sleepin'
is done #

01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:48.600
# The dawn is breaking #

01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:50.400
# Take a peek
at that sun #

01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:51.840
# Sweet Marie #

01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:53.160
# Better open
your eyes #

01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:54.320
# You'll soon be awake #

01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:56.360
# Now's the time
to arise #

01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:57.560
# Oh, Marie #

01:36:57.640 --> 01:36:59.320
# My broken heart #

01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:00.280
# My heart is #

01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:04.120
# Aching for you #

01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:05.520
# For you #

01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:10.920
# My sweet
Ma-Ma-Marie #

01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:17.800
Every place
you went those days,

01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:20.400
you saw more
and more uniforms.

01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:22.640
Half the world
was fighting already,

01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:25.360
and the other half was
rehearsing to get into it.

01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:28.920
Even Steve had applied
to go over as a chaplain.

01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:48.040
Better wait under here,
Miss Parker.

01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:49.480
I'll only be a minute.

01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:50.920
Thanks, Kelly.

01:37:57.680 --> 01:37:59.600
Oh, uh...Kelly's
getting me a cab.

01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:01.000
May I drop you
someplace?

01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:02.120
No, thank you.

01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:04.040
I just thought it would
give us a chance to--

01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:06.000
Oh, that's quite all right.
There are plenty of cabs.

01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:07.200
I'll find one.

01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:17.600
All ready?

01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:19.880
I changed my mind,
Molly. I'm not going.

01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:21.160
Aw, come on, Terry.

01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:22.760
You can drop me off
at the theater

01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:24.360
and then go over
The Lamb's Club

01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:25.600
and have a few laughs.

01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:27.560
And then I'll pick you up
after the show.

01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:29.560
We can take in
a midnight movie, hmm?

01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:31.880
Thanks, Molly.
I'm just not up to it.

01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:32.880
OK.

01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:35.640
See you later.

01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:40.000
Oh, uh, Terry,

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:41.400
I came across
some old arrangements,

01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:43.000
the stuff we used to do
with the kids.

01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:44.400
Let's go over them
tomorrow, huh?

01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:45.440
What for?

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:47.120
Well, the actor's fund's
having a benefit

01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:48.880
on the 19th.
I told you about it.

01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:49.960
They're tearing down
the Hippodrome,

01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:51.400
and they're trying
to get together

01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:52.800
some of the old acts
that played there.

01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:53.920
I'm a pretty old act.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.320
Maybe they better
tear me down, too.

01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:56.720
But they want us
to be in the show.

01:38:56.800 --> 01:38:57.680
You're kiddin', Molly.

01:38:57.760 --> 01:38:59.440
You know I couldn't
go out on a stage.

01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:00.680
I haven't done
an act since--

01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:02.120
Oh, Terry will you stop
talking this way?

01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:03.280
It's not gonna help anything.

01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:05.000
What are you gonna do,
spend the rest of your life

01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.880
moping around like this,
blaming yourself?

01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:09.120
Look, I miss him, too.
Every day. Every minute.

01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:10.560
But at least I keep goin'.

01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:12.440
How do you think I feel
goin' on every night,

01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:13.480
working with that girl?

01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:14.480
Oh, Molly.

01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:16.400
Come on, you're going
into town with me.

01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:17.840
Why? So we can
walk down Broadway,

01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:19.320
and you can look
into the face

01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:20.800
of every young kid
that goes by?

01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:21.760
Terry, please.

01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:22.800
Oh, Molly,
for Pete's sake,

01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:23.920
will you stop
nagging me?

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.360
I said I'm not going,
and I'm not.

01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:26.800
And that benefit
on the 19th,

01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:28.200
just figure
to play it yourself

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:29.320
because I won't be here.

01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:30.320
Why? Where you going?

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:31.440
I'm gonna go find him.

01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:32.920
Where? How do you know
where to look?

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.360
I don't. But I can't
sit around here

01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:35.320
any longer, Molly.

01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:36.760
I got to do
something. I--

01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:38.720
Terry, I'll be late
if I don't go now.

01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:40.200
Promise me you won't
do anything crazy.

01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:42.080
We can talk about it
when I get home.

01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:44.240
I'll be early. I'll skip
the curtain call, OK?

01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:45.280
Sure, Molly.

01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:38.960
# I'll grab him
by the collar #

01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:40.200
# And I'll holler #

01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:42.160
- # Ala #
- # Bam' #

01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:12.400
Hi.

01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:13.640
Well, hello,
Molly darling.

01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:14.640
Bobby!

01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:15.920
Hello, Molly! Heh heh!

01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:17.160
- Oh, Mrs. Donahue.
- Yes?

01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:18.840
You and your daughter
are in, uh, 12-A.

01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:20.240
Up these stairs
to your left.

01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:21.200
Thanks.

01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:23.520
I'll hang your dress up
back here.

01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:24.720
Thanks, Katy.

01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:25.960
Now, look,
when she gets here,

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.160
let me get things started.

01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:28.360
I know how to handle her.

01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:30.520
OK. But you know
how many times

01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:31.880
I've tried
at the theater.

01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:33.840
She just won't
listen to me.

01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:37.120
Oh, hi, Mom.
Come on in.

01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:38.800
Here, I'll take that.

01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:40.160
It's a little crowded
in here, isn't it?

01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:41.520
No. You'll have
loads of room.

01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:42.480
I've moved upstairs.

01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:43.640
You and Vicky
are sharing.

01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:44.680
Oh, are we?

01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:46.120
Well, if it's all
the same to you,

01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:47.560
I'll dress in the powder room
or someplace.

01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:49.280
You'll do nothing
of the kind.

01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:50.280
I told you
it wouldn't work.

01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:51.600
It'll work.
It'll work.

01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:52.920
Probably won't,
but I'm curious.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.000
What is it?

01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:55.960
Mom, I think you
owe Vicky an apology.

01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:56.920
What?

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.560
This isn't my idea,
Mrs. Donahue.

01:41:58.640 --> 01:41:59.880
No, it isn't.
It's mine.

01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:01.000
I think it's high time

01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:02.480
you two got things
straightened out.

01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:03.960
Ooh, so that's the plot.

01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:04.960
Apparently, my daughter--

01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:06.120
<i>You are my daughter,</i>

01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:07.280
aren't you, Mrs. Gibbs?

01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:08.240
I think so.

01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:09.680
Apparently,
my daughter has the idea

01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:11.600
that you and I
ought to be friends.

01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:13.040
Do you mind if I ask her

01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:14.480
what she thinks
we have in common?

01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:16.680
It's very simple.
You both love Tim.

01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:18.280
Oh, I see.

01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:20.400
Aren't you a little late?

01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:23.160
I might be.
I hope not.

01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:26.040
Mom, I'm crazy
about you, but...

01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:28.480
but you're stubborn,
and you're awfully tough.

01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:30.440
You can't go on
blaming Vicky.

01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:32.000
It was really Tim's fault.

01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:33.360
He did this whole thing
to himself.

01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:35.560
I was around. I saw it.

01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:37.880
You've gotta hear
her side of it.

01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:39.080
I'm getting out of here.

01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:41.040
The doctor said
I shouldn't get excited,

01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:43.080
and I'm all worked up.

01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:45.320
Be a little easy,
will you, Mom?

01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:51.160
Maybe I am tough and
stubborn, Miss Parker,

01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:54.360
but from where I sit,
it's pretty hard to believe

01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:56.680
that you're really
in love with Tim.

01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:58.800
I don't know how
to convince you,

01:42:58.880 --> 01:42:59.920
but it's true.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:01.800
Then fit Lew Harris
into this pretty picture,

01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:02.880
will you?

01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:05.600
Lew did everything for me.
You know that.

01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:07.360
Maybe he did
have some ideas.

01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:09.600
It doesn't mean
that I shared them.

01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:12.120
There was never anyone
for me but Tim.

01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:13.800
Too bad you didn't
let him know.

01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:15.560
I tried to,
Mrs. Donahue,

01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:17.440
but he was
pretty stubborn, too.

01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:20.680
Come in.

01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:25.000
Steve! Steve!

01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:26.160
Mom!

01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:27.480
Mom!

01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:29.440
Oh, it's so good
to see you!

01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:31.760
You look wonderful,
Father Donahue!

01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:33.960
Thin, but wonderful.

01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:35.160
Oh, excuse me.

01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:37.320
This is Tim's brother
Father Donahue.

01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:38.840
Steve, Vicky Parker.

01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:40.200
How do you do,
Miss Parker?

01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:41.920
I'm glad
to know you, Father.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.920
Tim used to talk
about you a lot.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.440
He was very proud
of you.

01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:48.040
Thank you. He talked
a lot about you, too.

01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:49.160
That's nice.

01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:50.520
Well, if you'll
excuse me,

01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:52.680
I'll find out where
they have me spotted

01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:54.640
in the show.

01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:57.720
Oh, Vicky.
Will you do me a favor?

01:43:57.760 --> 01:43:59.040
If you see Katy,

01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:00.960
tell her that her mother
isn't stubborn.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
It might take her
two or three years

01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:04.760
to change her mind,

01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:06.560
but she's not stubborn.

01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:09.760
Thanks, Mrs. Donahue.

01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:11.120
See you later.

01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:15.360
So that's the girl?

01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:17.840
Yeah. Nice girl, too.

01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:19.680
Your mom was
wrong again. Ha.

01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:21.920
Why didn't you let us
know you were coming?

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.360
Mom, I didn't know
myself.

01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:24.400
The whole regiment

01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:26.240
was just handed
a 24-hour pass.

01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:27.680
Now, I knew
by the papers

01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:29.120
that you're doing
a show here, so--

01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:30.560
A 24-hour pass?
Does that mean that--

01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:32.000
It means a 24-hour pass.

01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:33.640
Don't you double-talk me,
Steve Donahue.

01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:35.400
Mom, I'm not supposed
to say any more.

01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:38.840
Besides, I don't know
any more.

01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:40.360
Say, shouldn't you
be getting ready?

01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:42.200
Oh, I'm all made up.

01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:43.480
Just have
to put my dress on.

01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:44.760
Only be a minute.

01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:48.920
Is, uh...

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:50.320
Pop back?

01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:51.840
No.

01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:52.880
How did you know?

01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:54.320
Katy wrote me.

01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:56.240
I wish
there was some way

01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:57.520
we could help him.

01:44:57.600 --> 01:44:59.960
Yeah. Did, uh,
Katy also write you

01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:01.920
that you're
gonna be an uncle?

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.240
Yeah. Isn't that great?

01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:06.520
She booked me
for the christening.

01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:10.000
At least she and Charlie
are happy.

01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:12.280
Any news about Tim?

01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:13.440
Not a word.

01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:18.680
It's over a year, Steve.

01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:21.800
Even the detectives
have given up.

01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:25.400
I still believe
he'll be back, Mom.

01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:27.480
I'm not so sure.

01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:30.680
Sometimes I think we'll...
never see him again.

01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:31.680
Mom...

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:35.160
don't lose faith.

01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:37.520
I don't always
think that, Steve.

01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:39.160
Just sometimes.

01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:43.400
You're on next,
Mrs. Donahue. Five minutes.

01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:44.680
Be right with you.

01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:49.280
You wanna watch
from the wings?

01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:51.720
Yeah. That'll be great.

01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:53.120
OK, I'll fix it.

01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:21.600
# There's no business
like show business #

01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:25.320
# Like no business I know #

01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:28.720
# Everything about it
is appealing #

01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:32.200
# Everything the traffic
will allow #

01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:35.040
# Nowhere could you get
that happy feeling #

01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:38.760
# When you are stealing
that extra bow #

01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:42.400
# There's no people
like show people #

01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:46.040
# They smile
when they are low #

01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:49.320
# Yesterday they told you
you would not go far #

01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:51.040
# That night you open #

01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:52.920
# And there you are #

01:46:52.960 --> 01:46:54.680
# Next day,
on your dressing room #

01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:56.400
# They've hung a star #

01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:01.920
# Let's go
on with the show #

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:03.840
# The costumes,
the scenery #

01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:05.600
# The makeup, the props #

01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:09.240
# The audience that lifts you
when you're down #

01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:10.720
# The headaches,
the heartaches #

01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:12.520
# The backaches, the flops #

01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:16.600
# The sheriff who escorts you
out of town #

01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:18.560
# The opening
when your heart beats #

01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:22.160
# Like a drum #

01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:23.440
# The closing #

01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:29.120
# When the customers
don't come #

01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:31.040
# There's #

01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:34.000
# No business
like show business #

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:37.480
# Like no business I know #

01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:40.880
# You get word
before the show has started #

01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:44.000
# That your favorite uncle
died at dawn #

01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:47.000
# On top of that,
your pa and ma have parted #

01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:48.760
# You're broken-hearted #

01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:50.640
# But you go on #

01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:54.240
# There's no people
like show people #

01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:56.760
# They smile
when they are low #

01:47:56.840 --> 01:47:57.760
Mom.

01:47:57.840 --> 01:47:59.200
# Even with a turkey #

01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:01.240
# That you know will fold #

01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:04.760
# You may be stranded
out in the cold #

01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:06.120
# Still you wouldn't
change it #

01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:07.840
# For a sack of gold #

01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:11.000
# Let's go
on with the show #

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:15.320
# Let's go #

01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:18.920
# On with the #

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:24.600
# Show #

01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:27.000
Tim!

01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:28.280
Darling!

01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:33.400
Oh, why did you
do it, Tim, why?

01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:34.920
Well, I had to, Mom.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.120
I had to work things
out for myself.

01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:38.080
Oh!

01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:41.040
Where's Pop?

01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:42.680
Oh, he's...he's...

01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:44.560
Here, son.

01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:46.880
Terry!

01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:00.760
Hello, Pop.

01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:03.960
Oh, Tim.

01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:06.720
Oh, Terry!

01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:08.080
Hi, Molly.

01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:11.800
Will you look
at the woman?

01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:13.840
You'd think I was the
one who'd been lost.

01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:15.960
Please, Mrs. Donahue.
We're dead out there.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.720
You're supposed to lead us
into the big number.

01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:18.960
Oh, yes. I'm sorry.

01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:20.360
I'll be right with you.

01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:21.640
Somebody give me
their handkerchief.

01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:22.840
Here. I got one.

01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:24.600
All right, now,
you all hold it.

01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:26.080
I'll take care of this.

01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:27.080
Just stand back.

01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:32.920
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.280
first I want to thank you
for being so patient.

01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:37.480
My wife got
just a little excited.

01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:38.920
You see, the last time

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.600
we played
this wonderful old theater

01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:42.920
was the last time
that The Five Donahues

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:44.360
appeared together
as an act.

01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:45.320
Well, after that,

01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:46.800
lots of things happened, and...

01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:49.160
well, that's just the way
it was until...

01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:51.120
just now, backstage
when The Five Donahues

01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:52.200
got together again.

01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:53.800
And because we're
kind of sentimental

01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:55.040
about this old theater,

01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:56.640
we'd like to do
a little bit of

01:49:56.720 --> 01:49:57.920
<i>Alexander's
Ragtime Band,</i>

01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.360
the number we did
when we played here.

01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:01.560
Thank you.

01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:03.520
Ladies and gentlemen,
The Five Donahues.

01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:17.200
# Come on and hear,
come on and hear #

01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:19.400
# Alexander's
Ragtime Band #

01:50:19.480 --> 01:50:21.360
# Come on and hear,
come on and hear #

01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:23.480
# It's the best band
in the land #

01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:26.200
<i># And if you care
to hear the Swanee River #</i>

01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:28.200
# Played in ragtime #

01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:30.200
# Come on and hear,
come on and hear #

01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:32.800
# Alexander's Ragtime #

01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:35.880
# That raggy beat,
gets in your feet #

01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:37.600
# Come on and meet #

01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:40.240
# Alexander's #

01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:43.000
# Ragtime Band #

01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:45.200
# There's no business
like show business #

01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:46.920
# There's no business #

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.840
# That's half so thrilling #

01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:51.960
# The cowboys, the tumblers,
the wrestlers, the clowns #

01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:55.120
# The roustabouts
that move the show at dawn #

01:50:55.160 --> 01:50:58.560
# The music, the spotlights,
the people, the towns #

01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:01.400
# The thrill of that applause
when you go on #

01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:04.880
# You're standing out in front
on opening nights #

01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:07.960
# And there's your billing
right up there in lights #

01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:11.400
# There's no people
like show people #

01:51:11.480 --> 01:51:14.800
# They smile
when they are low #

01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:17.680
# Even with a turkey
that you know will fold #

01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:21.120
# You may be stranded
out in the cold #

01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:22.520
# Still you wouldn't
change it #

01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:24.080
# For a sack of gold #

01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:27.400
# You go on with the show #

01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:30.440
# There's no business
like show business #

01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:33.840
# Like no business I know #

01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:37.080
# Everything about it
is appealing #

01:51:37.160 --> 01:51:40.120
# Everything the traffic
will allow #

01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:42.800
# Nowhere can you get
that happy feeling #

01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:46.080
# When you are stealing
that extra bow #

01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:49.400
# There's no people
like show people #

01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:52.960
# They smile
when they are low #

01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:55.960
# Yesterday they told you
you would not go far #

01:51:56.040 --> 01:51:59.160
# That night you open,
and there you are #

01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:00.840
# Next day,
on your dressing room #

01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:02.200
# They've hung a star #

01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:06.080
# Let's go
on with the show #

01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:08.400
# Let's go #

01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:10.440
# On with the #

01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:13.320
# No business
like show business #

01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:18.520
# Let's go, go
on with the show #
