00:17.935 --> 00:19.895
Have you ever
been through something

00:20.104 --> 00:23.904
and you don't know
what just happened,

00:24.108 --> 00:27.818
but you know it was
important to go through?

00:28.029 --> 00:31.369
This is that journey for me.

00:55.640 --> 00:57.730
<i>Misogynist
ranting would be at home</i>

00:57.934 --> 00:59.694
in the far reaching
Internet subculture

00:59.894 --> 01:02.734
widely described as
the men's rights movement...

01:02.939 --> 01:06.859
<i>A toxic distillation of the worst
aspects of American sexism.</i>

01:07.068 --> 01:09.988
<i>It's a universe of message
boards where men get together</i>

01:10.196 --> 01:13.526
to express their hatred
towards women.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.831
<i>Well, 1 thought men
had all of the adv ant ages</i>

01:16.035 --> 01:17.075
in the world these days?

01:17.286 --> 01:18.786
That's utter nonsense.

01:18.996 --> 01:21.036
Men are routinely ground up
in a family court system

01:21.123 --> 01:23.173
that is misandrist
and biased against them.

01:23.376 --> 01:24.996
They are the majority
of the homeless.

01:25.211 --> 01:26.801
They are the majority
of suicides.

01:27.004 --> 01:28.844
They are majority
of the drug addicted.

01:29.048 --> 01:30.678
They are the majority
of the unemployed.

01:30.883 --> 01:32.493
They are majority
of the school drop outs.

01:32.510 --> 01:34.190
They are the majority
of those in prison...

01:34.345 --> 01:36.705
How do we know that they're
not the cause of these problems?

01:36.764 --> 01:39.524
<i>There's a reason that women live
longer, mark, let me tell you.</i>

01:39.725 --> 01:41.385
It is because we are stronger

01:41.602 --> 01:44.272
<i>and we are happier at the end
of the day than most men,</i>

01:44.480 --> 01:46.270
and that is factual
and you know it.

01:46.482 --> 01:48.562
And when men are married
to women who scream like you

01:48.734 --> 01:49.994
they just want to die sooner.

01:50.152 --> 01:52.152
- I'm not screaming.
- When you have...

01:58.452 --> 02:01.162
A voice for men...

02:01.372 --> 02:04.792
An online hub
for men's rights actmsts.

02:05.001 --> 02:08.920
They were founded by a man
named Paul elam.

02:09.130 --> 02:11.760
<i>It's a website
called “ a voice for men“</i>

02:11.966 --> 02:14.426
that's run by a man
named Paul elam...

02:14.635 --> 02:16.095
Which is "male"
spelled backwards,

02:16.304 --> 02:18.814
but it is his
real name apparently.

02:19.015 --> 02:21.805
It's a gathering
of women haters.

02:22.018 --> 02:24.688
This Southern poverty law center
has classified that group

02:24.895 --> 02:26.935
and men's rights groups
as hate groups.

02:27.148 --> 02:31.278
He wrote a piece

02:31.485 --> 02:33.235
declaring the month of October

02:33.446 --> 02:37.196
to be
"bash a violent bitch" month.

02:37.408 --> 02:39.828
"I mean, literally to grab
them by the hair,

02:40.036 --> 02:42.826
"and smack their face
against the wall," he wrote.

02:59.013 --> 03:00.973
Here he is.

03:21.035 --> 03:24.035
You may be wondering
why I'm sitting in a car

03:24.246 --> 03:27.996
<i>with notorious men's
rights actmst Paul elam.</i>

03:28.209 --> 03:29.789
That's a valid question.

03:30.002 --> 03:31.172
And to answer it,

03:31.379 --> 03:33.759
I need to start
at the beginning...

03:33.964 --> 03:38.184
The beginning of how
I became a feminist.

03:38.386 --> 03:41.216
<i>1 was a quiet kid, preferring
to observe from afar.</i>

03:41.430 --> 03:42.970
My mom put me in theater classes

03:43.182 --> 03:45.342
when I was eight years old
to break me out of my shell,

03:45.434 --> 03:46.564
and I loved it,

03:46.769 --> 03:48.439
so much to the point
that I decided

03:48.604 --> 03:50.484
to move to Hollywood
when I was 18 years old

03:50.690 --> 03:52.150
to become an actress.

03:52.358 --> 03:54.608
What I wasn't prepared for
was to be pigeonholed

03:54.819 --> 03:56.069
as the blonde who always died.

03:56.278 --> 03:57.608
Billy?

04:04.578 --> 04:06.708
Granted, I had a good scream.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.294
But the characters I played

04:08.499 --> 04:10.709
weren't alone
in feeling objectified.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.438
I was commonly harassed
on the streets,

04:12.503 --> 04:14.423
hit on by married producers,

04:14.630 --> 04:15.970
told by photographers
to come back

04:16.173 --> 04:18.593
when I lost 15 pounds
and got a boob job,

04:18.801 --> 04:21.851
and a plethora of other
uncomfortable experiences,

04:22.053 --> 04:24.894
all while still being
a teenager.

04:25.099 --> 04:27.269
I started to realize
my role in the world

04:27.476 --> 04:31.436
<i>seemed a little too similar to the
unfortunate roles 1 was audittoning for,</i>

04:31.647 --> 04:33.397
and it was not how I saw myself

04:33.607 --> 04:36.277
or the person
that I wanted to be.

04:36.485 --> 04:40.105
So I quit acting
and bought a video camera

04:40.281 --> 04:43.241
to tell the stories
I wanted to tell,

04:43.451 --> 04:46.751
and now I've been making
documentary films since 2008

04:46.954 --> 04:49.674
when I was 21 years old.

04:49.874 --> 04:53.674
<i>Most of my work has been about
women's issues and sexuality.</i>

04:53.878 --> 04:55.078
I've covered a range of topics

04:55.171 --> 04:57.471
from the phenomenon
of purity balls,

04:57.673 --> 04:59.883
to reproductive rights,

05:00.092 --> 05:01.932
single motherhood,

05:02.136 --> 05:04.176
and lgbt rights.

05:04.388 --> 05:08.558
After releasing my film in 2012
about marriage equality,

05:08.768 --> 05:12.188
I was at a loss of what topic
to explore next,

05:12.396 --> 05:15.896
and that's when two horrific
stories broke the news.

05:19.195 --> 05:21.235
Two star high school
football players

05:21.447 --> 05:23.367
in steubenville, Ohio,

05:23.574 --> 05:25.914
<i>have been found guilty of raping
a West Virginia teenager.</i>

05:29.205 --> 05:31.825
The video shows the former
steubenville student

05:32.082 --> 05:34.292
callously joking
about the incident.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.382
That's like rape.
It is rape.

05:36.587 --> 05:38.457
- Bro.
- They raped her.

05:38.672 --> 05:39.922
- Bro.
- They raped her.

05:40.132 --> 05:42.722
- This is the funniest...
- They raped her.

05:42.927 --> 05:45.807
Outrage across India
as a 23-year-old woman,

05:46.013 --> 05:48.473
the victim of one
of the most horrific rapes

05:48.682 --> 05:50.602
India has ever heard of.

05:50.810 --> 05:52.900
A 90-minute
horror for a 23-year-old

05:53.103 --> 05:55.023
medicine student on this bus.

05:55.231 --> 05:56.981
Gang raped and beaten,

05:57.191 --> 05:59.651
her friend assaulted
and thrown out of the bus...

05:59.860 --> 06:03.030
Every day, every woman is
facing violence on the streets.

06:03.239 --> 06:04.819
People are scared...

06:05.032 --> 06:07.372
I started to
research this rape culture.

06:12.790 --> 06:17.130
A website called
a voice for men popped up.

06:17.336 --> 06:19.916
Paul elam wrote
about how women long

06:20.130 --> 06:22.420
to live out
their rape fantasies,

06:22.633 --> 06:25.723
to be taken by a man
she's never spoken to,

06:25.928 --> 06:28.138
let alone given consent to.

06:28.347 --> 06:31.097
As 1 read, I was asking myself,

06:31.308 --> 06:34.648
is this the rape apologist
that I've been hearing about?

06:34.854 --> 06:37.364
The victim blamer
who perpetuates rape culture?

06:39.817 --> 06:42.777
I continued to read
a voice for men's website,

06:42.987 --> 06:44.777
often stopping
around the half-way mark

06:44.989 --> 06:47.159
in every article,
because I could only read

06:47.366 --> 06:49.196
so many "bitch,"
"fuck," "feminazi,"

06:49.410 --> 06:51.040
and "rapetard" words per minute.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.747
But even still, I kept reading,

06:55.958 --> 06:58.878
and thinking,
and reading some more.

07:02.423 --> 07:04.683
I was trying to understand
how these,

07:04.884 --> 07:07.014
what I perceived to be
women haters,

07:07.219 --> 07:08.759
could have so many followers.

07:20.107 --> 07:24.237
So I decided to meet
these mras...

07:28.490 --> 07:30.830
The ones leading the movement,

07:31.035 --> 07:32.655
and some of their
followers, too...

07:37.666 --> 07:40.336
And this begins my journey

07:40.544 --> 07:42.174
down the rabbit hole.

07:57.311 --> 07:58.731
This, ladies and gentlemen,

07:58.938 --> 08:01.358
is an historic moment.

08:01.565 --> 08:06.735
Never before has there been
a gathering of this magnitude

08:06.946 --> 08:11.116
to support men's
and boy's issues.

08:13.369 --> 08:16.659
We have got serious problems.

08:16.872 --> 08:18.422
I have been working
in this area,

08:18.624 --> 08:21.344
advocating for the rights of...

08:21.543 --> 08:24.053
Mra! Go away!

08:28.133 --> 08:29.393
And here we go.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.770
What you'll hear
is that we hate women.

08:35.975 --> 08:39.475
You'll hear that it's a backlash
against women's rights.

08:39.687 --> 08:42.557
You'll hear that we're regressives
that want women back in the kitchen

08:42.773 --> 08:45.903
and making sandwiches
and barefoot and pregnant.

08:46.110 --> 08:47.470
You're just bitter,
you're a loser,

08:47.653 --> 08:49.283
you're a whiner, you're ugly,

08:49.488 --> 08:50.778
you're undesirable, you're lazy.

08:50.990 --> 08:52.780
You're scary,
you must be a racist,

08:52.992 --> 08:53.992
you must be a misogynist.

08:54.118 --> 08:56.538
When we do speak out,

08:56.745 --> 09:00.535
women often don't want
to hear what we have to say,

09:00.749 --> 09:03.039
and so then we're called names.

09:03.252 --> 09:05.422
We're called whiners.

09:05.587 --> 09:08.717
And this is the way people who don't
want men to talk about issues

09:08.882 --> 09:10.472
try to shut us up.

09:13.178 --> 09:14.808
Um, we all know that you guys

09:15.014 --> 09:18.814
are a fascist Nazi front
group of white supremacists,

09:19.018 --> 09:20.688
no other way to openly organize

09:20.894 --> 09:23.694
other than calling yourselves
a men's rights group.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.937
Yeah!

09:26.150 --> 09:28.003
"We're somehow disempowered
because we're white men."

09:28.027 --> 09:29.647
Maybe it's just because
you're pathetic.

09:29.862 --> 09:32.322
We're here to fight
how misogynistic assholes

09:32.531 --> 09:34.211
think they have the right
to oppress women.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.616
White men are starting
to feel misplaced

09:36.827 --> 09:39.037
because women are sharing space.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.996
It's disgusting,
and just grow the fuck up

09:42.207 --> 09:44.537
and don't confuse suffrage
with oppression.

09:44.752 --> 09:47.092
Everyone suffers.
It's universal.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.924
I am a man and I need feminism.

09:50.132 --> 09:51.972
<i>We're feminists'.
We're fabulous'.!</i>

09:52.176 --> 09:54.256
We're here! We're queer!

09:54.470 --> 09:56.760
And it is crystal clear

09:56.972 --> 10:00.062
that the problems
for men and boys are real.

10:01.727 --> 10:03.087
I would like
to turn the microphone

10:03.187 --> 10:08.647
over to Paul elam
of a voice for men

10:08.859 --> 10:10.239
for some words.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.582
Whoo!

10:17.785 --> 10:19.995
This is a historic day.

10:20.204 --> 10:22.464
I've never seen
a gathering like this

10:22.664 --> 10:26.844
out of concern for
the general state of affairs

10:27.044 --> 10:28.754
for men and boys
in this culture.

10:28.962 --> 10:33.512
Trying to articulate
the entire platform

10:33.717 --> 10:35.177
of the men's rights movement

10:35.385 --> 10:38.305
is kinda like trying
to understand a snow drift

10:38.514 --> 10:40.524
one snowflake at a time.

10:40.682 --> 10:43.352
It's a very,
very complicated matter.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.100
Just consider this,

10:45.312 --> 10:50.652
that 93% of workplace
fatalities are men.

10:50.859 --> 10:53.949
Four of five suicides are men.

10:54.154 --> 10:57.454
Men are dropping out
of higher education

10:57.658 --> 10:59.538
at very alarming rates.

10:59.743 --> 11:03.873
We're down to 38% now
of college students are men,

11:04.039 --> 11:06.539
and it's dropping rapidly.

11:06.750 --> 11:10.090
Male suicide, male abuse,
male unemployment,

11:10.295 --> 11:13.335
male homelessness,
male failure in education,

11:13.549 --> 11:14.929
male health issues.

11:15.134 --> 11:17.144
You got the paternity
front issue,

11:17.344 --> 11:19.014
and the wrongful
paternity issue,

11:19.221 --> 11:21.931
the false allegation issue.

11:22.141 --> 11:26.521
Men are sentenced
to 63% more prison time

11:26.728 --> 11:28.938
for the same crime as women.

11:29.148 --> 11:31.608
They're less likely
to see a doctor.

11:31.817 --> 11:34.067
They're less likely
to have health insurance.

11:34.278 --> 11:37.198
The family court system
truly is biased against men.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.004
I mean, there's just
no question about it.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.489
It's really the pro choice
for women only movement,

11:41.702 --> 11:44.962
because men... they're denying
men any kind of choice

11:45.164 --> 11:46.254
once a child is conceived.

11:46.456 --> 11:49.536
Her body, her choice, right?

11:49.751 --> 11:51.091
Think about men.

11:51.295 --> 11:54.045
His body, his choice?
Not so much.

11:54.256 --> 11:55.376
Because the U.S. government

11:55.591 --> 11:56.971
does not want
to send you to die.

11:57.176 --> 12:00.096
It would rather send me to die.

12:00.304 --> 12:02.314
<i>Young men that
are fatltng to launch.</i>

12:02.514 --> 12:04.644
They're staying
in their homes of origin

12:04.850 --> 12:07.390
far past the time that
we would normally expect them

12:07.603 --> 12:09.023
to indmduate and move out

12:09.229 --> 12:10.859
and go live their lives.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.574
We have video game addiction.

12:12.774 --> 12:13.984
We have pornography addiction.

12:14.193 --> 12:16.993
We have the abuse of young boys

12:17.196 --> 12:19.276
with drugs like ritalin
to manage their behavior.

12:19.489 --> 12:20.779
Almost all victims

12:20.991 --> 12:23.371
of autism spectrum disorders
are boys.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.827
Boys are most likely
to be homeless,

12:26.038 --> 12:27.458
most likely to get cancer,

12:27.664 --> 12:30.384
most likely to die young
of every major cause,

12:30.584 --> 12:32.714
most likely to be arrested,
prosecuted,

12:32.920 --> 12:34.460
imprisoned, and even executed

12:34.671 --> 12:36.051
while being completely innocent.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.506
It doesn't matter
what their race is.

12:38.717 --> 12:40.507
It doesn't matter
what their ethnicity is.

12:40.719 --> 12:42.429
It doesn't matter
what their religious

12:42.638 --> 12:44.218
or non-religious views are.

12:44.431 --> 12:47.061
It doesn't matter
if they're gay or straight.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.727
Men and boys are in crisis

12:49.937 --> 12:52.227
and they need your help
and they need your support

12:52.439 --> 12:55.229
because they are
human beings, too,

12:55.442 --> 12:58.282
and you will not
shame me or anybody here

12:58.487 --> 13:01.107
into silence about it anymore.

13:05.619 --> 13:08.499
But if you start
to talk about those issues

13:08.705 --> 13:11.455
and address them
in terms of how they affect

13:11.667 --> 13:13.377
men and boys as a group,

13:13.585 --> 13:16.205
people get hostile about it.

13:16.421 --> 13:20.131
The idea is that men
have all the rights.

13:20.342 --> 13:21.972
They've always had the power.

13:22.177 --> 13:24.257
But if that's true,

13:24.471 --> 13:26.891
why can't men
talk about their problems?

13:27.099 --> 13:28.479
And that's what really got me

13:28.684 --> 13:30.814
interested in this
to begin with.

13:34.439 --> 13:37.859
<i>[3 ayet shortly after 1 began
filming men's rights actmsts,</i>

13:38.068 --> 13:42.408
I realized my own views
were being challenged.

13:42.614 --> 13:45.834
I kept a video diary
throughout filming,

13:46.034 --> 13:47.954
and I've decided to share

13:48.161 --> 13:51.041
some of those diaries with you.

13:51.248 --> 13:54.458
I really do feel like learning
about the men's movement

13:54.668 --> 13:56.298
and their specific issues,

13:56.503 --> 14:00.303
the issues
that they have issue with,

14:00.507 --> 14:03.887
it's hard for me
to completely understand them

14:04.094 --> 14:06.894
and...

14:07.097 --> 14:09.347
Just automatically feel welcome

14:09.558 --> 14:11.244
in that space of talking
about these issues.

14:11.268 --> 14:12.808
Because at least with feminism,

14:13.020 --> 14:14.520
whenever I heard
about the issues

14:14.730 --> 14:16.360
that feminists
were fighting against,

14:16.565 --> 14:19.775
I always felt like I had
something to draw from

14:19.985 --> 14:22.645
in experience
to be on board with that.

14:22.863 --> 14:25.413
And that's always been
why I've been drawn

14:25.615 --> 14:26.695
to the feminist movement,

14:26.908 --> 14:28.658
is because a lot
of what they spoke about

14:28.869 --> 14:30.329
I had personal experiences with.

14:30.537 --> 14:31.747
And with the men's movement,

14:31.955 --> 14:34.205
I have very little
personal experiences

14:34.416 --> 14:35.956
with the issues
that they talk about.

14:47.137 --> 14:51.597
<i>A cab driver who is
drmng a cab 70 hours a week</i>

14:51.808 --> 14:54.348
was not saying,
"I am earning this money

14:54.561 --> 14:56.611
to have power over my wife."

14:56.813 --> 14:58.573
He was earning this money

14:58.774 --> 15:01.074
even though it took power
away from his life.

15:01.276 --> 15:04.646
He was doing that so his child
wouldn't have to drive that cab.

15:09.159 --> 15:10.699
The garbage collector does not

15:10.911 --> 15:12.311
get up at 3:00 or 4:00
in the morning

15:12.329 --> 15:13.579
in rain and sleet and snow

15:13.789 --> 15:16.169
and get out to do the garbage

15:16.375 --> 15:18.335
so he can have more power
over his wife.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.923
That's power he's losing
over his life

15:21.129 --> 15:23.299
in order to make
his contribution,

15:23.507 --> 15:25.837
his sacrifice,
his way of loving.

15:26.051 --> 15:30.181
And this has been translated
into the culture of

15:30.389 --> 15:32.599
"you make more money
than women do,

15:32.808 --> 15:35.888
you must therefore
have more power."

15:36.103 --> 15:37.603
Meet Warren Farrell,

15:37.813 --> 15:38.983
best-selling author

15:39.189 --> 15:41.569
and self-styled
social anthropologist,

15:41.775 --> 15:46.945
<i>leading an assault on our
traditional thinking about men.</i>

15:47.155 --> 15:48.485
I asked my
girlfriend at the time

15:48.698 --> 15:50.578
to buy me as a gift,

15:50.784 --> 15:52.504
I think it was for Christmas
or my birthday,

15:52.661 --> 15:55.041
Warren Farrell's book
"the myth of male power,"

15:55.247 --> 15:59.037
which she did, and it just
changed my whole life.

15:59.251 --> 16:04.211
And his premise was while women
are often seen as sex objects,

16:04.423 --> 16:08.223
men are often seen
as success objects.

16:08.427 --> 16:10.507
And this resonated with me.

16:10.720 --> 16:14.470
He wrote this book that
questioned our notions of power,

16:14.683 --> 16:17.103
of who had power
and where it was,

16:17.310 --> 16:19.860
and it questioned
the roles of men,

16:20.063 --> 16:22.443
but not the way feminists

16:22.649 --> 16:25.649
had always questioned
gender roles.

16:25.861 --> 16:28.111
Every society that survived

16:28.321 --> 16:30.411
survived based on its ability

16:30.615 --> 16:33.985
to train its sons
to be disposable...

16:34.202 --> 16:37.042
Disposable in war as warriors,

16:37.247 --> 16:39.497
disposable in work
as firefighters,

16:39.708 --> 16:44.048
as workers on oil rigs
and so on, coal miners,

16:44.254 --> 16:46.724
and indirectly, therefore
disposable as dads.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.530
What happens in men's life

17:07.736 --> 17:09.695
when they're raised
that they're worthless

17:09.905 --> 17:11.155
unless they're a provider,

17:11.364 --> 17:13.074
that they must work
even if they have

17:13.282 --> 17:14.873
to take on
extremely dangerous work,

17:15.076 --> 17:18.246
they must get this done
or they're useless as men?

17:18.454 --> 17:20.825
That is very,
very powerful stuff.

17:21.082 --> 17:23.632
See, feminism did see accurately

17:23.835 --> 17:25.915
that we value male work

17:26.087 --> 17:28.837
more than we value female work.

17:29.049 --> 17:31.929
But there's also the issue

17:32.135 --> 17:34.005
that we value female life

17:34.221 --> 17:35.811
more than we value male life.

18:03.041 --> 18:05.881
Even when that plane
went down in New York City

18:06.086 --> 18:07.496
a few years ago and, you know,

18:07.712 --> 18:09.012
the pilot was a hero

18:09.214 --> 18:11.054
for the way he landed it
and saved everybody...

18:11.258 --> 18:13.798
<i>Word arrived over
the city-wide fire frequency</i>

18:14.010 --> 18:16.350
that a commercial jet liner
was in the water

18:16.555 --> 18:19.345
with 155 people on board.

18:19.558 --> 18:21.348
Then, over the next few minutes,

18:21.560 --> 18:23.900
the doors opened,
life vests were inflated,

18:24.104 --> 18:26.154
and, women and children first,

18:26.356 --> 18:27.976
everyone got off that plane.

18:28.191 --> 18:29.691
They saved all the women first.

18:29.901 --> 18:31.861
That's still... when I went
on a cruise, you know,

18:32.028 --> 18:35.618
there's still women into
the life boats first.

18:35.824 --> 18:37.834
Not because you're a man

18:38.034 --> 18:41.794
so you should be able to swim
halfway across the ocean,

18:41.997 --> 18:44.117
but because you're a man
you're expendable.

18:46.918 --> 18:49.588
We have to look at not just
the glass ceilings,

18:49.796 --> 18:51.256
but also the glass cellars.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.344
And, Paul,
I think as you were saying,

18:53.550 --> 18:55.800
we have to look at men
just not only as human doings,

18:56.011 --> 18:57.391
but also as human beings.

18:57.596 --> 19:00.056
When you survive because
somebody else is willing to die

19:00.265 --> 19:01.805
like in war,

19:02.017 --> 19:04.687
then that...
You're immune to the pain

19:04.894 --> 19:06.234
of the people who are dying

19:06.438 --> 19:08.018
because you have an investment

19:08.231 --> 19:09.571
in their being willing to die.

19:09.774 --> 19:12.784
You say, "1 will build a statue."

19:12.986 --> 19:14.896
I will remember you
in a history book."

19:15.113 --> 19:17.033
But if you look at that
from another perspective,

19:17.198 --> 19:18.738
that building of the statue

19:18.950 --> 19:20.180
or remembering you
in a history book

19:20.201 --> 19:23.831
is a bribe to be willing to die

19:24.039 --> 19:25.959
so that I can live.

19:29.753 --> 19:33.843
Both sexes in the
area where they are rejected

19:34.049 --> 19:37.469
tend to turn what rejects them
into an object.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.507
So the area where men...

19:40.722 --> 19:43.852
I'm watching this, um, lecture

19:44.059 --> 19:47.019
that Warren Farrell's
gmng in the '90s.

19:47.228 --> 19:48.608
I see some women in the crowd,

19:48.813 --> 19:50.823
and a lot of them
have their hands folded,

19:51.024 --> 19:54.824
and there is a little bit of...

19:57.197 --> 20:00.197
Uncomfortableness...

20:00.408 --> 20:01.988
By being a woman

20:02.202 --> 20:04.042
in a crowd of people

20:04.245 --> 20:08.455
while the speaker's talking
about how men are oppressed

20:08.667 --> 20:11.587
and women have it so great.

20:11.795 --> 20:17.255
It kinda puts you
on the defensive, as a woman.

20:17.467 --> 20:20.677
And understanding
that I feel that way

20:20.887 --> 20:22.757
makes me wonder

20:22.931 --> 20:27.441
are men having
their arms crossed

20:27.644 --> 20:29.444
listening to a feminist speaker

20:29.604 --> 20:31.194
talk about how men
have all the power

20:31.398 --> 20:33.438
and women are oppressed?

20:33.650 --> 20:37.070
Are men feeling like,

20:37.278 --> 20:39.108
"what are you talking about?"

20:39.322 --> 20:43.282
I don't have power,
and we have it pretty shitty

20:43.493 --> 20:45.043
on this side of the grass, too"?

21:02.679 --> 21:04.639
Women hold up half the sky!

21:04.848 --> 21:06.638
Women hold up half the sky!

21:06.850 --> 21:08.810
Women hold up half the sky!

21:09.018 --> 21:10.308
Women hold up half the sky!

21:10.520 --> 21:12.150
Fuck Warren Farrell!

21:12.355 --> 21:13.725
Fuck Warren Farrell!

21:13.940 --> 21:15.440
Fuck Warren Farrell!

21:15.650 --> 21:17.150
Fuck Warren Farrell!

21:17.360 --> 21:18.740
Fuck Warren Farrell!

21:18.945 --> 21:20.485
Fuck Warren Farrell!

21:20.697 --> 21:22.067
Fuck Warren Farrell!

21:22.282 --> 21:24.742
In 2012, Dr. Warren Farrell

21:24.951 --> 21:26.751
was speaking on behalf
of men's issues

21:26.953 --> 21:29.913
at the university
of Toronto in Canada.

21:32.292 --> 21:35.962
A feminist group
protested the event.

21:36.171 --> 21:37.551
<i>Be fucking ashamed of yourself.</i>

21:37.756 --> 21:41.336
You're fucking scum.
You are fucking scum.

21:41.551 --> 21:42.891
Fucking rape apologist,

21:43.094 --> 21:46.934
incest-supporting,
woman-hating fucking scum.

21:51.102 --> 21:52.742
You're fucking scum.
Yeah, just another...

21:57.525 --> 21:59.355
You know what, though?
Why would you pay money

21:59.569 --> 22:01.279
to fucking support
a fucking rape apologist

22:01.488 --> 22:02.908
if you weren't fucking one?

22:03.114 --> 22:04.624
I never heard him saying...

22:04.824 --> 22:07.494
Well, it...
Fucking scum!

22:10.079 --> 22:12.369
Who do you serve?
Who do you protect?

22:12.582 --> 22:15.172
Who do you serve?
Who do you protect?

22:15.376 --> 22:17.246
No! Fuck!
They're fucking scum!

22:17.462 --> 22:18.552
Fuck you!

22:19.964 --> 22:21.804
Fuck you!

22:22.008 --> 22:24.298
Get a real fucking job.

22:24.511 --> 22:26.391
Get out of here.

22:36.231 --> 22:38.481
<i>This is what men's
rights look like'.!</i>

22:38.691 --> 22:40.941
This is what
men's rights look like!

22:41.152 --> 22:43.492
This is what men's rights
look like!

22:43.696 --> 22:46.276
This is what
men's rights look like!

22:46.491 --> 22:48.911
This is what men's rights
look like!

22:49.118 --> 22:51.658
This is what
men's rights look like!

22:51.871 --> 22:54.371
This is what men's rights
look like!

23:23.820 --> 23:26.200
- Hi. How are you?
- Warren, I'm Cassie.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.866
<i>You' re Cassie? Oh, for some
reason 1 thought you were a male.</i>

23:29.075 --> 23:31.995
I'm just delighted
that you're a female.

23:32.203 --> 23:33.663
Well, thank you.

23:33.872 --> 23:35.462
Very glad to meet you.
Come on in.

23:35.665 --> 23:37.665
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

23:37.876 --> 23:39.956
<i>But Farrell wasn't
always so attentive to men.</i>

23:40.169 --> 23:44.469
In fact, for years, he focused almost
exclusively on women's issues,

23:44.674 --> 23:46.194
rubbing shoulders
with feminist leaders

23:46.259 --> 23:47.799
like Gloria steinem.

23:48.011 --> 23:50.011
And he's still
a card-carrying member

23:50.221 --> 23:52.971
of the national
organization for women.

23:53.141 --> 23:55.811
I believe that women cannot hear

23:56.019 --> 23:58.019
what men do not say.

23:58.229 --> 24:00.519
And he's got a lot
to say to both men and women

24:00.732 --> 24:02.072
in his provocative new book,

24:02.275 --> 24:04.485
"the myth of male power."

24:04.694 --> 24:06.864
I was making a very significant

24:07.071 --> 24:08.871
amount of money
speaking around the world

24:09.073 --> 24:11.333
on behalf
of women's issues alone.

24:11.492 --> 24:13.542
I went through a period
of forming men's groups.

24:13.745 --> 24:15.365
And then
when I listened to them,

24:15.580 --> 24:17.580
I thought, "well, gee,
this will be really helpful"

24:17.707 --> 24:19.747
to present to audiences
so that they can understand

24:19.959 --> 24:21.709
not only women's side,
but men's side, too,

24:21.920 --> 24:24.050
'cause I was really totally
in the feminist's camp.

24:24.255 --> 24:27.335
And immediately I saw
my standing ovations drop.

24:27.550 --> 24:29.280
I started hearing
that there was people saying,

24:29.302 --> 24:32.562
"don't invite him there
to speak with us."

24:32.764 --> 24:34.224
And pretty soon I had, you know,

24:34.432 --> 24:37.392
very few college and university
speaking engagements.

24:37.602 --> 24:39.852
How did you originally
get involved with feminism?

24:40.063 --> 24:41.563
Where did that all begin?

24:41.773 --> 24:43.193
I was doing my doctorate

24:43.399 --> 24:47.569
at political science at nyu
in the late '60s,

24:47.779 --> 24:49.609
and the women's
movement surfaced.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.169
And I started to say,

25:02.377 --> 25:04.997
"this is the most exciting
thing I've ever heard."

25:05.213 --> 25:07.763
Because I'd heard
of cml rights, gay rights,

25:07.966 --> 25:09.756
but suddenly women were saying,

25:09.968 --> 25:11.758
"I don't wanna be confined
to just being

25:11.970 --> 25:13.550
a homemaker, a secretary."

25:13.763 --> 25:16.063
So it's like, "why shouldn't
women be encouraged"

25:16.265 --> 25:17.885
to do everything
they possibly can do?"

25:18.101 --> 25:19.271
And at that point in time,

25:19.477 --> 25:21.977
I saw a lot of women
marrying men

25:22.188 --> 25:24.268
that they weren't
completely in love with,

25:24.482 --> 25:27.782
but the man earned
a fair amount.

25:27.986 --> 25:30.406
So I thought, that's just
a form of prostitution

25:30.613 --> 25:31.953
extended over a lifetime.

25:32.156 --> 25:33.986
How depressed
that must make a woman.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.761
And it's not gonna
be good for a man either.

25:35.785 --> 25:37.905
He never knows whether
he's loved for who he is

25:38.121 --> 25:39.291
or loved for what he has.

25:39.497 --> 25:41.957
And he's afraid
to give up producing

25:42.166 --> 25:43.996
because he's afraid
to lose love.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.050
And so women
who were successful to me

25:46.254 --> 25:47.774
appeared to be women
who would free men

25:47.922 --> 25:49.472
from having to be all, you know,

25:49.674 --> 25:51.974
wrapped up in just
being the only bread winner,

25:52.176 --> 25:54.886
and supporting one, two,
three, four, five people.

25:55.096 --> 25:57.096
It's one thing
to support yourself.

25:57.306 --> 25:59.056
When you're supporting
five people,

25:59.267 --> 26:01.307
you don't have the freedom
to question your boss,

26:01.519 --> 26:03.979
because you're
supporting five people.

26:07.525 --> 26:09.065
The first issue of feminism

26:09.277 --> 26:12.487
was to say,
"just because I'm a woman,

26:12.697 --> 26:15.617
maybe I don't wanna spend
my life raising children."

26:15.825 --> 26:19.075
You know, "don't force me into
that role against my will."

26:19.287 --> 26:20.617
So they looked at men and said,

26:20.830 --> 26:21.932
"well, you're not forced
to raise children."

26:21.956 --> 26:23.366
You don't have any issue.

26:23.583 --> 26:25.023
But for men,
the traditional sex role

26:25.043 --> 26:26.253
was not raising children.

26:26.461 --> 26:27.801
For us, the traditional sex role

26:28.004 --> 26:30.054
was to be a provider,
a protector,

26:30.256 --> 26:33.046
and to initiate relationships.

26:33.259 --> 26:35.299
Each of us
has traditional sex roles.

26:35.511 --> 26:37.391
Don't force us to carry out

26:37.597 --> 26:40.597
those traditional sex roles.

26:40.808 --> 26:44.268
We have the same rules
set up for men

26:44.479 --> 26:46.649
that they've always lived by,

26:46.856 --> 26:49.686
that you need to protect
and provide at any cost.

26:49.901 --> 26:53.821
But we've changed everything
where it concerns women.

26:54.030 --> 26:55.450
They now have access

26:55.656 --> 26:58.696
to everything men
have always had access to...

26:58.910 --> 27:03.290
To education, to work,
to whatever they want to do,

27:03.498 --> 27:07.458
but they're not the ones
drmng the semis

27:07.668 --> 27:10.878
and they're not the ones
in the coal mines.

27:11.089 --> 27:13.509
You don't hear the national
organization for women

27:13.716 --> 27:17.886
complaining that there is just
not enough female ditch diggers.

27:18.096 --> 27:20.806
It is still men
carrying the lion's share

27:21.015 --> 27:25.305
for what it takes to operate
and maintain this society,

27:25.520 --> 27:27.560
and it is still the expectation

27:27.772 --> 27:29.612
that if somebody's
gonna go down with the ship,

27:29.774 --> 27:31.444
it's gonna be men.

27:38.908 --> 27:42.698
Flexibility in roles is where
we should be all headed.

27:42.912 --> 27:45.792
Any men's rights actmsts
that I would support

27:45.998 --> 27:48.418
would support the portions
of the women's movement

27:48.626 --> 27:51.586
that is encouraging women

27:51.796 --> 27:54.256
to have more
flexibility in roles.

27:54.465 --> 27:56.755
So where do the men's movement

27:56.968 --> 27:59.348
and feminism disagree?

27:59.554 --> 28:02.434
Well, only on
the fundamental belief

28:02.640 --> 28:05.230
that the women's movement

28:05.434 --> 28:07.984
says men are the oppressors,

28:08.187 --> 28:11.937
that they... we are involved
in a patriarchal world

28:12.150 --> 28:17.360
in which men invented
the rules to benefit men

28:17.572 --> 28:19.952
at the expense of women.

28:20.158 --> 28:23.038
But don't we
live in a patriarchy,

28:23.244 --> 28:26.334
when most of the world's nations

28:26.539 --> 28:29.499
still have never had
a female leader...

28:40.011 --> 28:42.391
And less than 5°/o of CEOs

28:42.597 --> 28:45.637
of fortune 500 companies
are women?

28:49.103 --> 28:52.153
You have to look at this
in a larger perspective.

28:52.356 --> 28:55.776
Patriarchy is the result
of gender roles

28:55.985 --> 28:57.855
and not the vice versa.

29:02.325 --> 29:05.575
Traditionally, women's
power and responsibility

29:05.786 --> 29:07.576
has been in
the reproductive sphere,

29:07.788 --> 29:09.418
while men's power
and responsibility

29:09.624 --> 29:11.964
was in the productive sphere.

29:12.168 --> 29:14.588
You know, you have to reproduce
to continue the species,

29:14.795 --> 29:16.875
and you have to produce
to feed people

29:17.089 --> 29:18.509
so that they can reproduce.

29:18.716 --> 29:20.426
So, you know,
it's like they work together.

29:29.977 --> 29:32.517
And most
cultures diwied up roles

29:32.730 --> 29:35.150
because women were responsible
for childbirth

29:35.358 --> 29:37.278
and were more likely
to breastfeed.

29:37.485 --> 29:38.855
They're not more likely to...

29:39.070 --> 29:40.910
They did the breastfeeding.

29:41.113 --> 29:44.163
They tended to be involved
in the role of raising children.

29:44.367 --> 29:47.367
Men tended to be involved
in the role of raising money

29:47.578 --> 29:49.618
or making a killing
of the animals

29:49.830 --> 29:51.580
or making a killing
in wall street.

29:51.832 --> 29:55.252
But those were our obligations.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.421
So that's why industry
was male dominated

29:57.630 --> 29:59.050
and government
was male dominated,

29:59.257 --> 30:00.927
'cause that was our job.

30:01.133 --> 30:03.143
So what we call patriarchy

30:03.344 --> 30:07.184
is men gmng in
to the expected roles

30:07.390 --> 30:08.790
that they're supposed
to give in to,

30:08.849 --> 30:10.529
and many of those roles
are very harmful...

30:10.685 --> 30:14.225
Working exceptionally
long hours, difficult hours,

30:14.438 --> 30:17.068
dangerous jobs,
getting killed on a job...

30:17.275 --> 30:20.355
<i>Even politics a lot of people
describe as masochism.</i>

30:22.446 --> 30:26.276
Imagine what it takes to be
a successful politician.

30:26.492 --> 30:29.502
Imagine how much of your
personal life that you give up,

30:29.704 --> 30:33.294
how much you work, how much
privacy that you sacrifice,

30:33.541 --> 30:35.881
how much freedom
in your day to day life

30:36.085 --> 30:37.495
that goes out the window.

30:37.712 --> 30:39.712
There are more men
willing to do those things

30:39.922 --> 30:41.722
than there are women.

30:41.882 --> 30:44.592
Oh, I think we got a pen
for everybody.

30:44.802 --> 30:47.512
But also, just
because men are the ones,

30:47.722 --> 30:50.892
for instance,
writing the laws in general,

30:51.100 --> 30:54.150
doesn't mean that the laws
are protecting men.

30:54.353 --> 30:56.403
You hear about
patriarchy, right?

30:56.605 --> 30:58.083
All the evils of the world
is from patriarchy.

30:58.107 --> 31:01.317
But we're the ones dying,
you know?

31:01.527 --> 31:03.107
And we die for you guys,
you know?

31:03.321 --> 31:06.321
To protect our families,
our friends.

31:06.532 --> 31:09.122
In every society
that's ever existed,

31:09.327 --> 31:12.657
women have had prmlege
and protection that men did not.

31:12.872 --> 31:17.342
For example, we never hear
about how men were excluded

31:17.543 --> 31:20.633
from the forced labor
convention of 1930.

31:20.838 --> 31:22.918
For years,
the forced labor convention

31:23.132 --> 31:26.512
was an international treaty
that banned slavery,

31:26.719 --> 31:28.009
enforced servitude,

31:28.220 --> 31:29.350
but it made an exception

31:29.555 --> 31:33.095
for able-bodied males
ages 18 to 45.

31:34.852 --> 31:37.362
Eventually,
they got rid of that,

31:37.563 --> 31:39.363
but there was still an exemption

31:39.565 --> 31:44.235
for prisoners and military,
which is 90°/o male.

31:44.445 --> 31:48.945
Stop pretending
that you're oppressed

31:49.158 --> 31:51.738
and men are your oppressors.

31:51.911 --> 31:54.371
It's a lie,
and it's a hurtful lie,

31:54.580 --> 31:56.920
and it's a hateful lie,
and it's wrong.

32:15.768 --> 32:18.398
You talk a lot
about the red pill

32:18.604 --> 32:20.864
in a voice for men.
What is the red pill?

32:21.065 --> 32:23.315
Oh, it's sort of
a cultural slogan.

32:23.526 --> 32:26.236
It comes from the movie
"the matrix"

32:26.445 --> 32:29.195
where the character Neo
is given the choice

32:29.407 --> 32:31.197
between a red pill
and a blue pill.

32:31.409 --> 32:35.619
You take the red pill,
you stay in wonderland

32:35.830 --> 32:38.420
and I show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes.

32:38.666 --> 32:42.206
And if he swallows the red pill,

32:42.420 --> 32:45.130
the scales will be peeled back
from his eyes.

32:45.297 --> 32:49.137
He will see everything
that he hasn't been able to see.

32:49.343 --> 32:51.893
And if he takes the blue pill,
he'll just go back to sleep

32:52.096 --> 32:54.216
and live in his sort of unaware,

32:54.432 --> 32:56.602
semi-comatose state forever,

32:56.809 --> 32:58.889
and probably be a lot happier.

32:59.103 --> 33:00.773
It's a pretty apt analogy.

33:00.980 --> 33:04.530
So what is the blue pill
in this world?

33:04.733 --> 33:08.243
Well, the blue is the paradigm
that most people live by,

33:08.446 --> 33:10.026
that men have all the power,

33:10.239 --> 33:12.239
that they've always
had all the power,

33:12.450 --> 33:15.040
that domestic violence
is a problem

33:15.244 --> 33:17.664
that's committed by men
against women only,

33:17.872 --> 33:19.392
that sexual assaults
are only committed

33:19.582 --> 33:21.672
by men against women,

33:21.876 --> 33:23.456
that women
don't make the same money

33:23.669 --> 33:26.089
for the same work as men.

33:26.297 --> 33:28.507
"Teach men not to rape.
Only men can stop rape."

33:28.674 --> 33:30.264
Men commit domestic violence.

33:30.468 --> 33:32.298
"We need to stop
violence against women..."

33:32.511 --> 33:35.261
instead of just
stopping violence.

33:35.473 --> 33:37.183
That is feminist training.

33:40.478 --> 33:44.478
The mras...

33:44.690 --> 33:46.940
Say that we live
in a blue-pill world

33:47.151 --> 33:49.741
where women are victims,
men are perpetrators,

33:49.945 --> 33:51.855
and it's all a lie

33:52.031 --> 33:54.911
and that we're brainwashed
to believe this,

33:55.117 --> 33:56.287
and that it's not true,

33:56.494 --> 33:57.894
and that men are slaves
in this world

33:57.912 --> 34:01.292
and women are...

34:01.499 --> 34:03.829
<i>1 don't think women are
necessarily the puppet masters,</i>

34:04.043 --> 34:08.303
but I think they're
saying that women

34:08.505 --> 34:12.795
have the easy way out
and men are...

34:13.010 --> 34:15.139
They're given medals and statues

34:15.346 --> 34:17.346
and written in the history books

34:17.556 --> 34:21.436
to justify them dying
and being slaves to work

34:21.643 --> 34:23.813
or being, uh...

34:24.021 --> 34:27.071
Being used
to progress societies.

34:32.821 --> 34:35.741
And I've just...
I've believed for so long

34:35.949 --> 34:39.330
that... that I'm...

34:39.536 --> 34:42.286
At a disadvantage
for being a woman

34:42.498 --> 34:44.418
and that I have to work
harder than everyone else

34:44.542 --> 34:47.752
and I have more to overcome
and I have more to prove

34:47.962 --> 34:49.462
just because of my gender.

34:49.672 --> 34:52.132
But the mras are saying
that this is all a lie

34:52.341 --> 34:53.761
and that guys
are actually the ones

34:53.967 --> 34:58.178
that are disadvantaged
and discriminated against.

35:02.226 --> 35:03.936
And, actually,
the more 1 learn from them,

35:04.144 --> 35:07.194
the more I think, "thank god
I wasn't born a guy."

35:07.398 --> 35:10.148
Because I don't think

35:10.359 --> 35:15.359
that the expectations on men...

35:15.573 --> 35:17.373
Is good or healthy.

35:17.575 --> 35:19.445
I mean,
they have so much pressure

35:19.660 --> 35:21.290
to succeed and to be strong

35:21.495 --> 35:23.365
and to stand up
and protect others

35:23.581 --> 35:25.461
and to put their lives
on the line.

35:28.544 --> 35:30.754
I don't think I would want
that responsibility.

35:30.963 --> 35:35.053
But, you know, 50 years ago,

35:35.259 --> 35:36.889
no, I wouldn't have
wanted to be a woman.

35:39.972 --> 35:42.982
But now, I mean,
maybe just 11"s right now

35:43.183 --> 35:44.393
that the tides are changing

35:44.602 --> 35:48.362
and women are the...

35:48.564 --> 35:50.944
Have the better deal.

35:51.150 --> 35:52.820
Well, no, I don't know.

35:59.992 --> 36:01.412
And then sometimes I think

36:01.619 --> 36:05.829
the mras are just duping me

36:06.040 --> 36:09.630
and gmng such a strong pitch

36:09.835 --> 36:11.205
about what they believe in

36:11.420 --> 36:13.300
to convince me of something

36:13.505 --> 36:16.295
that's actually just
some out there theory

36:16.508 --> 36:17.838
that men
are discriminated against

36:18.052 --> 36:20.352
and women are...
Have the advantage.

36:25.142 --> 36:29.022
Yes, this is Cassie jaye.

36:29.229 --> 36:32.319
It's regarding a documentary
about the men's rights movement,

36:32.524 --> 36:36.034
and we're looking
for feminist voices now

36:36.236 --> 36:37.356
to speak in the documentary.

36:55.130 --> 36:56.840
Feminist majority.

36:57.049 --> 36:58.249
Yeah, hold on just one second.

37:10.229 --> 37:11.649
So I realized, "okay",

37:11.855 --> 37:13.583
I need to bring some
feminists into the mix...

37:13.607 --> 37:15.418
<i>- Good.
- To make sure that we have that side.“</i>

37:15.442 --> 37:16.492
good.

37:16.694 --> 37:18.494
I was researching rape culture,

37:18.696 --> 37:21.696
and so that's how
I stumbled across a website

37:21.907 --> 37:23.487
called avoiceformen.Com.

37:23.701 --> 37:25.601
So some of the people that
we've already interviewed

37:25.619 --> 37:29.829
on the mra side is Paul elam
with a voice for men.

37:30.040 --> 37:31.880
- Yeah.
- Are you familiar with him?

37:32.084 --> 37:33.734
Oh, I'm familiar with him.
I've never met him.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.752
- Yeah.
- Obviously, they've spent

37:35.963 --> 37:37.363
a significant amount
of time and energy

37:37.381 --> 37:39.091
denouncing me, so I figured
I might as well

37:39.299 --> 37:41.549
have a look at what they say.

37:41.760 --> 37:44.720
Yeah, really, the men's rights
movement is part of the backlash.

37:44.930 --> 37:47.430
- The backlash?
- To feminism.

37:47.641 --> 37:50.891
The men's rights movement
really got going

37:51.103 --> 37:53.113
as women began to make gains,

37:53.313 --> 37:56.113
and some men
have felt threatened

37:56.316 --> 38:00.606
by the opportunities that
have been opened up to women.

38:00.821 --> 38:02.101
And I don't know if it's because

38:02.197 --> 38:04.317
some of them feel threatened

38:04.533 --> 38:05.743
that they now have to compete

38:05.951 --> 38:07.911
with a lot more people
for their jobs.

38:08.120 --> 38:11.920
They now can't
get into the best schools

38:12.124 --> 38:14.884
if a woman or a girl
has better grades.

38:15.085 --> 38:16.545
Think about it.

38:16.754 --> 38:18.344
Grandfather's generation
probably had it

38:18.547 --> 38:20.337
pretty well, right?

38:20.549 --> 38:24.549
All of his needs,
his shirts were ironed,

38:24.762 --> 38:26.722
all of that was always
taken care of.

38:26.930 --> 38:28.180
Well, you know, grow up,

38:28.390 --> 38:30.770
realize the world has changed.

38:30.976 --> 38:33.346
And as much as the mras

38:33.562 --> 38:35.522
would like things to go back
to the way they were

38:35.689 --> 38:38.479
and use the argument

38:38.692 --> 38:40.362
that women
have an advantage now...

38:42.321 --> 38:44.491
No person looking at the data

38:44.698 --> 38:46.948
can possibly say women
have an advantage.

38:47.159 --> 38:51.579
We're just beginning to get
a level playing field here.

38:51.789 --> 38:56.169
It's not tilted in our favor,
I can tell you that.

38:56.376 --> 38:58.586
And they know it.
They know it.

38:58.796 --> 39:04.466
But it's the constant
distortion of the data,

39:04.676 --> 39:08.636
it's the spinning of a situation

39:08.847 --> 39:12.977
to make it look like women
are somehow getting ahead,

39:13.185 --> 39:15.765
getting an advantage
they don't deserve.

39:15.979 --> 39:20.069
Um, it's, uh...
It's part of the backlash.

39:20.275 --> 39:24.445
<i>Political organizing comes from
a feeling of victimization,</i>

39:24.655 --> 39:27.195
<i>which 1s why the men's rights
movement makes that claim</i>

39:27.366 --> 39:30.076
that men are the victims
of discrimination.

39:30.285 --> 39:31.695
But it doesn't
have much traction

39:31.912 --> 39:35.542
because you look around
and it's hard to see it.

39:35.749 --> 39:38.839
We don't have movements called,
you know, straight liberation.

39:39.044 --> 39:42.554
Is the men's... the question
I would pose rhetorically is

39:42.756 --> 39:47.426
is the men's rights movement
really the gendered version

39:47.636 --> 39:49.346
of the white
nationalist movement?

39:49.555 --> 39:52.425
Because there are plenty
of white people

39:52.641 --> 39:54.271
who say that
they are the victims

39:54.476 --> 39:56.346
of reverse discrimination.

39:56.562 --> 39:58.732
Of course, it's not gonna have
very much traction.

39:58.939 --> 40:03.239
<i>You can't really organize the
people who are super ordinate.</i>

40:07.823 --> 40:09.913
So do you think that men

40:10.117 --> 40:13.657
are being discriminated
against in any way?

40:13.871 --> 40:15.661
Not under the law.

40:15.873 --> 40:18.673
Men are not disadvantaged
under our laws

40:18.876 --> 40:22.746
or in the business world.

40:22.963 --> 40:26.683
<i>As a class, men are not
underrepresented on corporate boards</i>

40:26.884 --> 40:29.894
or the top of the fortune
1,000 companies.

40:30.095 --> 40:32.675
In the corporate world,
in the business world,

40:32.890 --> 40:34.680
in a lot of parts of academia,

40:34.892 --> 40:37.272
in the military,
in the sports world,

40:37.436 --> 40:40.556
it's still pretty much
a male-dominated world,

40:40.772 --> 40:41.982
where a lot of the prmleges

40:42.190 --> 40:44.650
and power and status
accrue to men.

40:44.860 --> 40:49.280
Men are advantaged over women,
no question.

40:49.489 --> 40:52.529
No one can...
No one can debate that.

40:52.743 --> 40:55.253
Not with a serious...

40:55.454 --> 40:58.584
Not in any seriousness.

41:08.300 --> 41:10.390
<i>1 was a math
major as an undergraduate,</i>

41:10.594 --> 41:13.564
and one of the fundamental
things about geometry

41:13.764 --> 41:16.274
is the distance
from point "a" to point "b"

41:16.475 --> 41:19.515
equals the distance
from point "b" to point "a,"

41:19.728 --> 41:22.648
and if women
are so different from men

41:22.856 --> 41:25.526
that men can't understand
the female experience,

41:25.734 --> 41:28.324
we need to listen to women
to describe it,

41:28.528 --> 41:30.318
then the male experience
is so different

41:30.530 --> 41:32.730
from the female experience
that you can't understand it.

41:32.908 --> 41:34.278
You need to listen to us.

41:34.493 --> 41:36.333
You can't really compare

41:36.536 --> 41:41.746
how men and women
have suffered from sexism.

41:41.959 --> 41:44.799
There's no way to quantify,

41:45.003 --> 41:48.173
you know,
that kind of suffering.

41:48.382 --> 41:52.722
<i>So 1f a woman says, “well, 1
miss 30°10 of my income...</i>

41:57.891 --> 42:01.311
"More than you miss
six years of life..."

42:04.815 --> 42:06.815
There's no way to quantify that.

42:07.025 --> 42:10.775
Or "I've lost a job opportunity
because I'm a woman."

42:10.988 --> 42:14.368
There's no way to say,
"I've suffered more than you"

42:14.574 --> 42:16.994
because you've lost a kid
because you're a man.

42:17.202 --> 42:20.082
You know, we can't...
But it is serious.

42:20.288 --> 42:23.708
And at least if...

42:23.917 --> 42:26.207
If you're denied a job
because you're a woman,

42:26.420 --> 42:27.900
at least you can go
to another company

42:28.005 --> 42:29.455
and apply for a job, you know?

42:29.673 --> 42:31.383
But you can't...
When you lose your kid,

42:31.591 --> 42:33.631
you can't say, "okay, I'll
get custody of that kid."

42:33.802 --> 42:35.602
I'll try for that one."

42:35.804 --> 42:38.184
It's a terrible thing
that happens.

42:41.101 --> 42:43.851
There was a case...
The serpico case.

42:47.190 --> 42:49.230
You might be too young
to know the movie "serpico"

42:49.443 --> 42:50.963
- with al Pacino.
- Yeah, I don't know.

42:51.028 --> 42:53.068
It was about a New York City
undercover cop.

42:53.280 --> 42:54.680
He gets shot at the end
of the movie

42:54.781 --> 42:56.281
and retires
from the police force.

42:56.491 --> 42:58.871
And he was a real man,
frank serpico.

42:59.077 --> 43:02.537
A woman, after the movie,
after this was made,

43:02.748 --> 43:04.618
decided she wanted
to become a single mother

43:04.833 --> 43:07.093
and tricked him
into fathering a child.

43:07.294 --> 43:08.844
And the court accepted that,

43:09.046 --> 43:11.256
because she told her friends
she was going to trick him

43:11.465 --> 43:12.985
and they testified,
and the court said,

43:13.050 --> 43:14.890
"yes, you were tricked into it,"

43:15.093 --> 43:19.143
and still awarded her over 90°/o
of his police pension.

43:19.306 --> 43:21.226
So everything that he
goes through in this movie,

43:21.433 --> 43:24.853
including getting shot,
to earn his pension,

43:25.062 --> 43:28.862
she won by
sleeping with him one night.

43:29.066 --> 43:30.856
My son's mom wanted
to have children with me

43:31.068 --> 43:32.648
and I had always refused,

43:32.861 --> 43:34.861
you know, saying,
"you have this anger problem."

43:35.072 --> 43:36.412
You need to get counseling.

43:36.615 --> 43:38.655
I'm not gonna consider
having children with you

43:38.867 --> 43:40.487
"until that's dealt with,"

43:40.702 --> 43:42.912
'cause she would lose
her temper almost every day,

43:43.121 --> 43:44.621
and just use
any weapon she could.

43:44.831 --> 43:47.381
And, like, a child's
the perfect weapon,

43:47.584 --> 43:49.094
so I was really
definite about that.

43:49.294 --> 43:52.134
But she also used to proofread
my articles for me.

43:52.339 --> 43:56.089
And I wrote an article
for "playboy" about serpico.

43:56.301 --> 43:59.101
And when she read that,
she told her friend

43:59.304 --> 44:01.684
she's gonna trick me
into fathering the child.

44:01.890 --> 44:03.390
She doesn't need my permission.

44:03.600 --> 44:07.600
And so that's how my son
was conceived.

44:07.813 --> 44:11.113
Then she said,
"if you wanna see your son,"

44:11.316 --> 44:13.276
you have to stay
in a relationship with me.

44:13.485 --> 44:14.985
But if you break up with me,

44:15.195 --> 44:17.485
"I know all the things
that a woman can do to a man."

44:17.656 --> 44:20.696
You know, she read all my articles.
She saw my talk shows.

44:20.909 --> 44:22.639
<i>"She said," 1 know all the
things a woman can do to a man,</i>

44:22.661 --> 44:24.001
and I'll do 'em to you."

44:24.204 --> 44:26.624
So, um, that's what
I had to deal with.

44:26.832 --> 44:29.082
Everything that I had been
raising awareness about

44:29.292 --> 44:31.752
for the previous 17 years,

44:31.962 --> 44:35.722
she combined into one thing
for me to live through.

44:35.924 --> 44:37.684
It's really ironic.

44:40.679 --> 44:43.519
For the first...

44:43.723 --> 44:46.773
Five to seven years, I guess,

44:46.977 --> 44:50.187
we would see each other four
times a day for exchanges.

44:50.397 --> 44:52.107
On average, every single day

44:52.315 --> 44:54.435
I had to deal with some scene...

44:54.651 --> 44:57.361
A scene meaning
she would just not show up

44:57.571 --> 45:00.951
or she would hold the kid out
and then pull him back

45:01.158 --> 45:02.438
and hold him out and pull him...

45:02.576 --> 45:03.719
And just kind of play with me.

45:03.743 --> 45:05.163
Or she'd let me have the kid

45:05.370 --> 45:06.560
and then she'd stand
in front of the car

45:06.580 --> 45:07.580
so I couldn't move.

45:15.338 --> 45:18.548
Another time, I saw her
hold him by the shoulders

45:18.758 --> 45:20.758
and say, "daddy is a bad man."

45:20.969 --> 45:22.929
Daddy is a very bad man."

45:25.307 --> 45:27.347
And so I had to go through
this long custody battle,

45:27.559 --> 45:29.939
and the decisions
that they would make,

45:30.145 --> 45:32.145
you would just go, "how..."

45:32.355 --> 45:34.475
there couldn't
be any explanation.

45:34.691 --> 45:38.401
Either they're absolute idiots
or it's biased.

45:38.612 --> 45:40.702
There's just no other
explanation for it.

45:42.949 --> 45:45.409
One other thing,
his mom is obese

45:45.619 --> 45:49.459
and wanted him to be obese
for various reasons.

45:49.664 --> 45:51.794
One thing is
so he would identify

45:52.000 --> 45:54.840
more with her side
of the family than mine,

45:55.045 --> 45:57.625
'cause we're all...
All thin.

45:57.797 --> 46:01.007
Another was so that he would
enjoy being with her more,

46:01.218 --> 46:04.138
'cause when he was at my house,
he had to get actmty,

46:04.346 --> 46:06.216
you know, and eat
well-balanced meals,

46:06.431 --> 46:08.021
and get his sleep and stuff.

46:08.225 --> 46:10.225
And at her house,
they would bake brownies

46:10.435 --> 46:12.475
and stay up late
and just watch TV.

46:12.687 --> 46:14.332
So where would you...
If you're a little kid,

46:14.356 --> 46:16.226
where would you
enjoy being more?

46:16.441 --> 46:19.821
But he self-reported
to the mediator

46:20.028 --> 46:22.198
how upset he was
about being obese,

46:22.405 --> 46:24.115
that the worst thing in school

46:24.324 --> 46:27.494
was when kids called him fatty
and how he cried,

46:27.702 --> 46:30.042
and his physician said that

46:30.247 --> 46:32.207
he's really concerned medically.

46:32.415 --> 46:34.035
And then what I did,
he was at an age

46:34.251 --> 46:37.051
where he would imitate
things that I would do.

46:37.254 --> 46:38.694
You know,
I gave him a broken shaver,

46:38.838 --> 46:40.838
so when I shaved,
he would pretend to shave.

46:41.049 --> 46:42.339
And what I did was,

46:42.550 --> 46:44.070
I started weighing myself
every morning

46:44.261 --> 46:48.061
and writing down my weight,
the date and my weight,

46:48.265 --> 46:49.705
and I taught him
how to read a scale.

46:49.891 --> 46:53.061
So he kept his own records.

46:53.270 --> 46:57.070
<i>So I had six months worth of
statistics to show consistently</i>

46:57.274 --> 46:59.864
that every time he was with
his mom for a few days,

47:00.068 --> 47:02.278
he'd come back weighing
three to four pounds more,

47:02.487 --> 47:04.857
and then he'd lose it
while he was with me.

47:05.073 --> 47:06.663
So they had, you know,

47:06.866 --> 47:08.826
how much he was upset
about the problem,

47:09.035 --> 47:11.495
they had his physician
being upset about the problem,

47:11.705 --> 47:13.665
and they had the proof
of where the problem lay.

47:13.873 --> 47:15.503
So the judges' decision

47:15.709 --> 47:17.499
was, um, that father
should no longer

47:17.711 --> 47:19.881
be allowed to weigh the child.

47:20.088 --> 47:21.088
Problem solved.

47:25.135 --> 47:27.675
After 14 years,
my body gave out.

47:27.887 --> 47:29.507
And I got sicker
than I've ever been.

47:29.723 --> 47:31.313
I realized I'm gonna die.

47:31.516 --> 47:32.796
That's not
gonna do anybody good.

47:32.851 --> 47:34.101
I've gotta give up the fight.

47:34.311 --> 47:35.521
So I gave up custody,

47:35.729 --> 47:37.809
and so I don't
see my son anymore.

47:38.023 --> 47:40.113
He hasn't been
in my house since.

47:40.317 --> 47:42.107
- Um.
- I'm so sorry.

47:42.319 --> 47:44.399
So I did lose him.

47:55.332 --> 47:59.342
Fred claims that during
his 14-year custody battle,

47:59.544 --> 48:00.634
he spent the equivalent

48:00.837 --> 48:03.257
of five years
of his gross income

48:03.465 --> 48:05.465
on legal fees, mediators,

48:05.675 --> 48:07.635
and child support payments.

48:07.844 --> 48:09.554
I was really
in his life a lot longer

48:09.763 --> 48:11.933
than most fathers
would have been.

48:12.140 --> 48:14.560
It's something
most fathers can't afford.

48:23.360 --> 48:24.360
Ito me

48:33.495 --> 48:35.365
we generally know that fathers

48:35.580 --> 48:37.100
don't get as good a deal
in family court

48:37.123 --> 48:38.753
and we don't really
complain about it

48:38.958 --> 48:40.168
until it happens to us,

48:40.377 --> 48:41.697
and even then,
a lot of men don't.

48:41.753 --> 48:43.383
Many men's rights actmsts

48:43.588 --> 48:45.548
come into being
men's rights actmsts

48:45.757 --> 48:47.427
as a result
of getting a divorce,

48:47.634 --> 48:49.364
wanting to be equally
involved with the children,

48:49.386 --> 48:52.386
and realizing that women
have the right to children

48:52.597 --> 48:55.597
and men have to fight
for children.

48:55.809 --> 48:59.599
<i>When your family
courts run on the supposition</i>

48:59.813 --> 49:03.903
that mothers are more fit
to be custodial parents

49:04.109 --> 49:06.989
and that fathers are more fit

49:07.195 --> 49:11.405
to provide a check every month

49:11.616 --> 49:14.986
and to become what we like
to call "uncle daddy,"

49:15.203 --> 49:18.003
where they visit...
Visit their children,

49:18.206 --> 49:20.626
<i>to me, that's one of the greatest
obscenities 1n the world,</i>

49:20.834 --> 49:23.344
the idea of visiting
your own children,

49:23.545 --> 49:24.795
where you get to see them

49:25.004 --> 49:26.844
for two hours
on Wednesday night,

49:27.048 --> 49:31.338
<i>and you get to have them for “x“
amount of hours every other weekend,</i>

49:31.553 --> 49:33.933
and you have no say
in how they're brought up.

49:45.525 --> 49:46.725
You know, I can't tell you

49:46.943 --> 49:49.863
how many men
have been in this office,

49:50.071 --> 49:52.531
in that chair,

49:52.740 --> 49:56.450
in tears because they can't
see their kids.

50:11.634 --> 50:12.764
Yeah, and some of this stuff

50:12.969 --> 50:15.309
ends up in horrific
consequences.

50:15.513 --> 50:18.773
Like this gentleman here,
that's his little son.

50:18.975 --> 50:20.685
They found him dead...

50:20.894 --> 50:22.694
Not the son, but the young man,

50:22.896 --> 50:26.266
in the desert
with a bullet in his head

50:26.483 --> 50:28.693
the day before the family court

50:28.902 --> 50:30.492
where it became known

50:30.695 --> 50:33.485
that he was gonna get to see
his little guy even less.

50:35.617 --> 50:37.487
And of course,
he'd be falsely accused

50:37.702 --> 50:39.292
one time after another
after another.

50:39.496 --> 50:41.076
It had destroyed his life.

50:41.289 --> 50:43.879
It had bankrupt him,
driven him into debt.

50:44.083 --> 50:45.293
It caused him to miss work.

50:45.502 --> 50:47.302
He was about ready
to lose his job.

50:47.504 --> 50:48.694
He was at the end of his rope,

50:48.713 --> 50:52.343
so he just decided to end it.

50:52.550 --> 50:55.720
The unfairness
in the family courts,

50:55.929 --> 50:57.449
the unfairness
in the way child support

50:57.514 --> 50:58.894
is so often structured,

50:59.098 --> 51:00.638
it's commonplace,
and it's everywhere,

51:00.850 --> 51:02.500
and the more you start
to become conscious of it,

51:02.519 --> 51:04.019
the more you realize
that it's there.

51:09.692 --> 51:13.742
<i>1 started to research
some father's rights issues</i>

51:13.947 --> 51:18.117
and came across
some harrowing stories,

51:18.326 --> 51:20.576
like this man in south Carolina

51:20.787 --> 51:23.327
who found out his
only daughter was adopted away

51:23.540 --> 51:26.920
by the mother without
his knowledge or consent...

51:27.126 --> 51:28.166
His daughter was with

51:28.378 --> 51:30.548
an adoptive family
in California,

51:30.755 --> 51:32.965
so he began his fight
to get his daughter back.

51:33.132 --> 51:36.142
Adoption is for children
without families,

51:36.344 --> 51:39.764
not children with a willing
and capable family.

51:39.973 --> 51:41.933
And this man in Colorado

51:42.141 --> 51:44.561
who lost his daughter
when the mother left the state

51:44.769 --> 51:46.349
to give birth in Utah

51:46.563 --> 51:49.323
where he wouldn't have
legal rights to his child.

51:49.524 --> 51:51.364
He fought for
four years in court

51:51.568 --> 51:55.358
and finally won
visitation rights...

51:55.572 --> 51:57.572
Only visitation.

51:57.782 --> 52:00.162
<i>1 can't explain the
emotion, the happiness...</i>

52:00.368 --> 52:03.708
This hard fight,
and what this means to me...

52:03.913 --> 52:06.833
And then there's
this heartbreaking story.

52:07.041 --> 52:09.791
The 20 year old
father never left her side

52:10.003 --> 52:12.843
until he was forced to give her
to adoptive parents this week

52:13.047 --> 52:16.007
after Kaylee's mother decided
to put her up for adoption.

52:16.217 --> 52:17.967
In order to keep Kaylee,

52:18.136 --> 52:21.176
Colby needed to file paternity
action, an affidavit,

52:21.389 --> 52:24.179
and a commencement notice
with Utah's vital records

52:24.392 --> 52:25.812
a day before the mother signed

52:26.019 --> 52:28.189
the adoption papers
relinquishing her rights.

52:28.396 --> 52:31.606
<i>But 1n Colby's case, the mother
only gave him a few hours notice</i>

52:31.816 --> 52:33.646
of what she was going to do.

52:33.860 --> 52:36.450
I would like her back.

52:36.654 --> 52:37.914
Men in the men's movement

52:38.114 --> 52:41.624
are not upset
about having to be fathers.

52:41.826 --> 52:44.866
<i>They're upset because they're
not allowed to be fathers.</i>

52:45.079 --> 52:48.419
That guy...

52:48.625 --> 52:50.625
Blows his head off,
blows his brains out.

52:50.835 --> 52:54.005
Out of family court?

52:54.213 --> 52:56.453
<i>And people don't think there's
something wrong with that?</i>

52:58.384 --> 53:01.104
We just open the doors
tomorrow for business as usual

53:01.304 --> 53:02.974
and that's okay?

53:12.607 --> 53:14.227
I've always thought of feminism

53:14.442 --> 53:17.822
as being the fight
for gender equality.

53:18.029 --> 53:20.449
And yet I've never heard
about father's rights

53:20.657 --> 53:23.277
and the injustices going on
in family court.

53:25.036 --> 53:26.696
Why is this?

53:26.913 --> 53:32.253
I decided to ask gender studies
professor Michael messner.

53:32.460 --> 53:35.880
Well, I'll just say,
I don't think 11"s...

53:36.089 --> 53:37.879
I don't think that a lot
of their assumptions

53:38.091 --> 53:39.931
are correct to start with.

53:40.134 --> 53:42.474
There's no doubt
that there have been some men

53:42.679 --> 53:44.259
who get just screwed

53:44.472 --> 53:49.062
by court decisions
and custody cases.

53:49.268 --> 53:53.268
But I think when you look
at the broader patterns,

53:53.481 --> 53:56.281
it's still the case that

53:56.484 --> 54:01.164
in intact heterosexual
families with kids,

54:01.364 --> 54:03.124
women are still doing
the vast majority

54:03.282 --> 54:05.792
of the housework and child care,

54:05.993 --> 54:08.793
and there's a lot of
sort of father absence,

54:08.996 --> 54:10.786
lack of participation
by fathers,

54:10.957 --> 54:15.497
some of whom, I think,
after divorce happens,

54:15.712 --> 54:19.092
end up suddenly wanting

54:19.298 --> 54:22.718
equality, you know, as fathers

54:22.927 --> 54:24.927
when they haven't really
been participating equally

54:25.054 --> 54:26.264
as fathers before.

54:26.472 --> 54:29.562
So to me, it always
kind of swings back

54:29.767 --> 54:33.647
to the feminist perspective
of how we need to push

54:33.855 --> 54:35.935
for full equality
across the board,

54:36.149 --> 54:39.109
including before divorces.

54:39.318 --> 54:41.738
And if we have that,
then we might expect

54:41.946 --> 54:44.656
more symmetry
after divorces happen.

54:49.203 --> 54:51.543
The more I
researched father's rights,

54:51.748 --> 54:55.498
the more I realized how deep
this rabbit hole goes,

54:55.710 --> 54:58.460
not only in
the amount of issues,

54:58.671 --> 55:00.131
but also in the vast array

55:00.339 --> 55:03.679
of perspectives on these issues.

55:03.885 --> 55:05.965
I decided to create a flow chart

55:06.179 --> 55:09.099
of what I thought
fathers' options might be

55:09.307 --> 55:11.977
following a surprise pregnancy.

55:12.185 --> 55:14.345
I then put a green line
for the paths

55:14.562 --> 55:16.982
that I thought would be
good turn-outs for the father.

55:17.190 --> 55:18.570
And I put red lines
for the paths

55:18.775 --> 55:21.985
that seemed to not be good
for the father.

55:22.195 --> 55:25.565
Then I created a flow chart
for women's options

55:25.782 --> 55:27.952
and did the same
with green and red lines.

55:31.162 --> 55:33.002
And as I stepped back,

55:33.206 --> 55:36.166
I saw all the red lines
for the women's options

55:36.375 --> 55:37.955
if she does not want the child.

55:40.338 --> 55:43.298
But something dawned on me.

55:43.508 --> 55:48.388
<i>Of every path the biological
father could go down,</i>

55:48.596 --> 55:52.516
he's at the mercy of
the woman's sole discretion.

55:52.725 --> 55:56.475
Although women have
very difficult choices to make,

55:56.687 --> 56:00.607
she at least has the choice.

56:00.817 --> 56:02.817
But for biological fathers,

56:03.027 --> 56:06.777
they have no say
over their parental destiny.

56:19.794 --> 56:21.344
This is my friend darrah.

56:21.546 --> 56:24.546
She's eight months pregnant
with her first child

56:24.757 --> 56:27.047
and she's a lifelong feminist.

56:30.972 --> 56:34.232
It seems from what I've read,
that women seem to have

56:34.433 --> 56:37.233
more reproductive rights
than men do.

56:37.436 --> 56:39.646
I don't know what to say.
We carry children.

56:39.856 --> 56:41.226
They're never gonna
carry children.

56:41.440 --> 56:42.650
It's just a different thing.

56:42.859 --> 56:45.069
So, 1 guess,
as much as possible,

56:45.278 --> 56:48.658
take the steps
to prevent yourself

56:48.865 --> 56:50.615
being in that situation.

56:50.825 --> 56:52.545
It's just, like, I don't
know what to say.

56:52.660 --> 56:55.080
There's no...
There's nothing...

56:55.288 --> 56:57.418
A woman has been...

56:57.623 --> 57:00.463
Women have been blamed for,
and still are,

57:00.668 --> 57:04.258
for unwanted pregnancies,

57:04.463 --> 57:05.673
choosing to have an abortion,

57:05.882 --> 57:07.172
not choosing
to have an abortion,

57:07.383 --> 57:09.263
choosing to put
their child up for adoption.

57:09.468 --> 57:15.268
<i>When the burden lies on a single
mother 1f the man leaves,</i>

57:15.474 --> 57:18.694
societally, she's lam basted.

57:18.895 --> 57:20.095
So there's a lot of things

57:20.313 --> 57:22.113
that women deal with
in that regard

57:22.315 --> 57:24.275
that men don't
actually deal with.

57:24.483 --> 57:26.903
So I can have compassion
for their situation,

57:27.111 --> 57:28.701
but I don't know
that it's gonna change

57:28.905 --> 57:31.695
in the way they want it to,
because it's biology.

57:31.908 --> 57:34.698
So if you're going to
be having sex

57:34.911 --> 57:36.701
that could result in pregnancy,

57:36.913 --> 57:38.503
and you haven't had
this conversation

57:38.706 --> 57:40.496
with the woman that
you're having sex with,

57:40.708 --> 57:42.428
you better have it.
You better have it fast.

57:42.543 --> 57:46.513
That's when the man has
the ability to make decisions...

57:46.714 --> 57:50.514
Either not to engage in sex
or to use condoms

57:50.718 --> 57:52.928
and to use other forms
of contraception.

57:53.137 --> 57:55.507
That's where his role comes in.

57:55.723 --> 57:57.353
Once he's impregnated her,

57:57.558 --> 58:00.938
she's the one now faced
with continuing a pregnancy,

58:01.145 --> 58:04.935
faced with the health risks
that accompany pregnancy.

58:05.149 --> 58:08.319
So... his rights have to

58:08.486 --> 58:11.106
be exercised early.

58:11.322 --> 58:16.742
But once she's pregnant,
all decisions must be hers.

58:16.953 --> 58:21.503
Because ultimately,
she is the most impacted.

58:21.707 --> 58:23.327
There's just no question.

58:23.501 --> 58:25.631
<i>She ultimately has the
responsibility for that child.</i>

58:31.467 --> 58:32.587
So before we were married,

58:32.802 --> 58:34.972
he promised me
we would have two kids,

58:35.179 --> 58:36.809
and now he doesn't want anymore.

58:37.014 --> 58:38.564
Aww.

58:38.766 --> 58:40.126
My friends think
I should trick him

58:40.184 --> 58:41.734
and stop taking
my birth control.

58:41.894 --> 58:44.774
Men have never been
in control of our bodies,

58:44.981 --> 58:46.571
we're the ones in control.

58:46.774 --> 58:48.494
Clap if you think
that she should trick him.

58:50.736 --> 58:54.776
My people.
Up next, everybody...

58:54.991 --> 58:57.371
So it sounds like
men's reproductive rights

58:57.576 --> 59:01.366
are limited to the choice
of whether or not to have sex

59:01.580 --> 59:04.790
<i>and the choice of whether
or not to use protection.</i>

59:05.001 --> 59:07.801
But what if he's tricked
into fatherhood?

59:08.004 --> 59:12.384
Or what if he's not
even the father?

59:12.591 --> 59:15.011
What does paternity fraud
look like?

59:15.219 --> 59:19.849
It's ugly.
It's extraordinary ugly.

59:20.057 --> 59:21.577
And we have to distinguish it
between paternity fraud

59:21.600 --> 59:24.230
- and wrongful paternity.
- What's the difference?

59:24.437 --> 59:27.687
Wrongful paternity
can be innocent.

59:27.898 --> 59:30.028
"Okay, we went to a party,
I had sex with six guys."

59:30.234 --> 59:32.114
I think it was when I was
hanging out the window

59:32.278 --> 59:34.028
I got pregnant,
but I wasn't sure.

59:34.238 --> 59:36.008
But you know, if anybody
knows that guy's name,

59:36.032 --> 59:38.622
"would you please
have him call me?"

59:38.826 --> 59:40.386
And then she names
one of the other guys

59:40.453 --> 59:43.003
and he didn't have sex with her.

59:43.205 --> 59:45.615
It wasn't malicious.
It wasn't intentional.

59:45.833 --> 59:47.633
She wasn't trying
to harm anybody.

59:47.835 --> 59:50.455
She was just trying
to figure out who it was.

59:50.671 --> 59:53.341
Wrongful paternity.

59:53.549 --> 59:56.679
More often,
and less facetiously,

59:56.886 --> 59:58.796
"okay, I'm married
and I had an affair."

01:00:01.599 --> 01:00:03.849
Obviously, here there's
all sorts of problems,

01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:05.600
because there are more victims

01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:07.491
than the person who's named
as dear old dad

01:00:07.646 --> 01:00:10.066
who may be the wrong one.

01:00:10.274 --> 01:00:11.844
There's everybody
involved in the family,

01:00:11.859 --> 01:00:14.279
like the situation in Texas

01:00:14.487 --> 01:00:16.367
where the family had five
little towhead kids...

01:00:16.489 --> 01:00:18.659
All guys, all little blondos.

01:00:18.866 --> 01:00:20.446
And all of a sudden,

01:00:20.659 --> 01:00:21.849
one day one of the little
blondo kids gets in trouble,

01:00:21.869 --> 01:00:23.449
has to go to the hospital.

01:00:23.621 --> 01:00:25.621
They can't get ahold of mom.
They get ahold of dad.

01:00:25.706 --> 01:00:28.876
Dad rushes to the hospital,
needs to give blood.

01:00:29.085 --> 01:00:30.165
Whoops.

01:00:30.336 --> 01:00:32.296
Can't do it. Wrong blood.

01:00:32.505 --> 01:00:34.465
"What?"

01:00:34.673 --> 01:00:36.883
All the kids look alike.

01:00:37.093 --> 01:00:39.893
Turns out it was the guy
down the street.

01:00:40.096 --> 01:00:42.306
- You've heard of this case?
- It's a real case.

01:00:42.515 --> 01:00:44.765
So what happens to this family?

01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:49.895
Can you fathom what happens
to this family?

01:00:50.106 --> 01:00:51.896
How do think the kids feel
when they find out

01:00:52.108 --> 01:00:53.348
dear old dad isn't dear old dad

01:00:53.526 --> 01:00:54.669
and it's the guy down
the street?

01:00:54.693 --> 01:00:56.953
How do you think dad feels,

01:00:57.154 --> 01:00:59.914
that these five little boys
that he still loves dearly,

01:01:00.116 --> 01:01:01.886
when he finds out they're
not his bio children.

01:01:01.909 --> 01:01:03.829
But he can't tear away,
'cause he loves them.

01:01:04.036 --> 01:01:06.116
He's devoted himself to these...

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:08.290
How do you think he feels?

01:01:08.499 --> 01:01:10.709
I mean, it's horrific.

01:01:10.918 --> 01:01:13.128
Horrific.

01:01:13.337 --> 01:01:16.127
That's not wrongful.
That's deliberate.

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:18.460
- So that's paternity fraud?
- That's paternity fraud.

01:01:18.551 --> 01:01:20.551
She knew who the father was
and lied about it.

01:01:22.930 --> 01:01:24.770
Paul was right when he said

01:01:24.974 --> 01:01:27.354
trying to understand
the men's rights movement

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:30.150
is like trying
to understand a snowdrift

01:01:30.354 --> 01:01:34.364
one snowflake at a time.

01:01:34.567 --> 01:01:36.937
There are unique
father's rights issues

01:01:37.153 --> 01:01:40.533
that vary between
unmarried, married,

01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:43.329
and divorced dads.

01:01:43.534 --> 01:01:46.414
But there are also
men's right's issues

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:48.500
for non-biological fathers...

01:01:51.917 --> 01:01:54.957
Like this man
who is facing jail time

01:01:55.171 --> 01:01:56.961
for failure to pay child support

01:01:57.173 --> 01:02:01.143
for a child that DNA tests
prove isn't his.

01:02:01.343 --> 01:02:03.683
Carnell Alexander still owes

01:02:03.888 --> 01:02:07.978
more than $30,000 to the state
for a child that's not his

01:02:08.184 --> 01:02:10.194
because the mom
wrote his name down

01:02:10.394 --> 01:02:11.984
because she needed
to name someone

01:02:12.188 --> 01:02:13.898
in order to get
welfare benefits.

01:02:14.106 --> 01:02:16.186
I had to put him down
as the father.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.961
That was the only way
I could get assistance.

01:02:17.985 --> 01:02:21.405
I'm almost homeless.
I'm almost in jail.

01:02:21.614 --> 01:02:23.074
I'm out of work

01:02:23.282 --> 01:02:25.282
my money is being
threatened to be taken.

01:02:25.451 --> 01:02:27.451
<i>Reporter} He says the law
needs to be changed,</i>

01:02:27.661 --> 01:02:30.211
so when this happens,
as it often does,

01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:33.174
other men don't become
dad by default.

01:02:40.966 --> 01:02:43.546
<i>A lot of times
people wonder about mras,</i>

01:02:43.761 --> 01:02:46.221
"why are you guys so angry?"

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:49.060
And my answer to that is,
"why aren't you?"

01:02:49.266 --> 01:02:53.226
How can anybody look at this
and not be angered by it?

01:02:53.437 --> 01:02:57.437
<i>And the only answer to that I've
ever been able to come up with</i>

01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:59.820
is that people aren't angry

01:03:00.027 --> 01:03:01.987
because they don't see men
as human beings.

01:03:16.627 --> 01:03:19.837
I continued
traveling north America,

01:03:20.047 --> 01:03:24.177
meeting mras
from all walks of life,

01:03:24.385 --> 01:03:26.255
hearing their personal stories,

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:28.510
their red pill moments.

01:03:28.722 --> 01:03:30.522
I met a young man
who was sexually abused

01:03:30.724 --> 01:03:32.064
when he was 16 years old

01:03:32.268 --> 01:03:34.018
while lmng at a residential home

01:03:34.228 --> 01:03:37.108
for people with
developmental disabilities.

01:03:37.314 --> 01:03:39.254
She was the only woman
I've done anything ever with,

01:03:39.275 --> 01:03:42.145
partly because it just
messed me up so much.

01:03:42.361 --> 01:03:44.861
She continues working there.

01:03:49.076 --> 01:03:51.286
She hit me in the face.

01:03:51.495 --> 01:03:53.285
She actually hit me
throughout the house,

01:03:53.497 --> 01:03:55.247
chased me throughout the house.

01:03:55.499 --> 01:03:58.249
When I reported my domestic
assault to police officers,

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:03.220
I did not at all bring up the fact
that I was sexually assaulted.

01:04:03.424 --> 01:04:05.094
Because if he wasn't
going to believe

01:04:05.301 --> 01:04:07.511
that I was a victim
of domestic violence,

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.160
there was no way
he was gonna believe

01:04:09.305 --> 01:04:11.555
that I was gonna be
a victim of sexual assault.

01:04:15.477 --> 01:04:18.307
I met the honey badgers,

01:04:18.522 --> 01:04:21.152
women who are
men's rights advocates.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:27.720
And then there
was a 15-year-old boy,

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:29.120
there was
a 35-year-old woman,

01:04:29.325 --> 01:04:30.805
and then later on
she came out of jail

01:04:30.909 --> 01:04:34.329
and she was able
to collect child support

01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:36.168
from this boy that she raped.

01:04:36.373 --> 01:04:37.713
Yeah.

01:04:37.916 --> 01:04:39.246
After getting out of jail.

01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:41.130
So there's lack
of fairness for men

01:04:41.337 --> 01:04:43.127
in the court systems.

01:04:43.339 --> 01:04:45.919
When police officers show up
to a domestic violence case

01:04:46.133 --> 01:04:47.843
often men were just taken away

01:04:48.052 --> 01:04:50.142
without asking
what even happened.

01:04:50.346 --> 01:04:52.556
It's just presumed
that men are the criminals.

01:04:55.142 --> 01:04:58.352
I was assaulted several times,
and I never got any help.

01:04:58.562 --> 01:05:01.022
I went to the police still
bleeding a couple of times,

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:04.741
and one police officer said...

01:05:04.943 --> 01:05:08.163
I'll never forget this, he said,

01:05:08.364 --> 01:05:09.684
"if she starts
hitting you again,"

01:05:09.782 --> 01:05:11.062
you better get out
of there fast,

01:05:11.158 --> 01:05:12.198
because if she just breaks

01:05:12.368 --> 01:05:13.608
a fingernail trying to hit you,

01:05:13.786 --> 01:05:15.326
"we'll arrest you."

01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:17.017
I mean, I can't tell you
at this point

01:05:17.122 --> 01:05:19.172
how many guys I've talked to
who are like,

01:05:19.375 --> 01:05:20.560
"yeah, you know, she stabbed me

01:05:20.584 --> 01:05:22.004
and they put me in jail."

01:05:22.211 --> 01:05:24.761
Not only are there
endless studies

01:05:24.963 --> 01:05:27.223
that show women are
just as violent as men are,

01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:30.184
when I would talk about it,
invariably,

01:05:30.386 --> 01:05:32.926
men would start coming out of
the woodwork with stories...

01:05:35.933 --> 01:05:37.393
Stories they were
afraid to tell,

01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:40.601
stories that they got
laughed at for,

01:05:40.813 --> 01:05:43.153
stories they they
got blamed for.

01:05:43.357 --> 01:05:47.397
It's hideous.

01:05:47.611 --> 01:05:49.201
This is not flattering to men

01:05:49.405 --> 01:05:50.985
to talk about
men's vulnerabilities,

01:05:51.198 --> 01:05:54.788
to talk about the ways
that they are not strong

01:05:54.993 --> 01:05:58.963
and that they are, well, weak.

01:05:59.164 --> 01:06:01.634
And to be honest about it,
it's not flattering.

01:06:01.834 --> 01:06:05.004
A solution for both genders

01:06:05.212 --> 01:06:07.422
is that we need to be
able to recognize

01:06:07.631 --> 01:06:09.801
how men are vulnerable

01:06:10.008 --> 01:06:11.194
and we need to be able
to recognize

01:06:11.218 --> 01:06:13.218
how women are actors.

01:06:13.429 --> 01:06:16.309
Because we have
a huge blind spot

01:06:16.515 --> 01:06:18.595
especially when women
do bad things.

01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:25.191
My best friend

01:06:25.399 --> 01:06:27.279
that I grew up with
since kindergarten

01:06:27.484 --> 01:06:30.244
was being physically abused
by his wife

01:06:30.446 --> 01:06:33.816
who he'd been married to
for 20 years.

01:06:33.991 --> 01:06:36.951
<i>She' ll break glass and
throw 1t at him, punch him.</i>

01:06:37.161 --> 01:06:39.251
I've seen it happen
spontaneously,

01:06:39.455 --> 01:06:42.665
and it was frequent.

01:06:42.875 --> 01:06:43.955
And he's bigger than her,

01:06:44.168 --> 01:06:46.668
but he didn't want to hit her.

01:06:46.879 --> 01:06:48.199
And he didn't want
the children...

01:06:48.255 --> 01:06:49.665
They had three minor children,

01:06:49.882 --> 01:06:52.842
he didn't want them
seeing this at all.

01:06:53.051 --> 01:06:55.721
So he would usually
just go outside,

01:06:55.929 --> 01:06:58.059
because there would be
glass breaking

01:06:58.265 --> 01:07:00.475
or things being smashed
or yelling,

01:07:00.684 --> 01:07:02.484
and he knew that the neighbors

01:07:02.686 --> 01:07:04.346
might think it's him.

01:07:04.563 --> 01:07:06.153
So he would go outside

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:09.356
so that the neighbors
could see what's happened.

01:07:09.568 --> 01:07:11.488
Eventually, I said,
"look, you're gonna need..."

01:07:11.695 --> 01:07:13.415
You need professional help,
and so does she.

01:07:13.489 --> 01:07:15.369
"Maybe the kids do, too."

01:07:15.574 --> 01:07:18.874
So I called a bunch of
domestic violence shelters.

01:07:19.036 --> 01:07:21.496
I just looked around online
and I called,

01:07:21.705 --> 01:07:24.075
but every place
that I called said,

01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:25.881
"we don't help men.

01:07:26.084 --> 01:07:28.634
We don't help male...
Men at all."

01:07:28.837 --> 01:07:33.797
And I started becoming curious
about why that was,

01:07:34.009 --> 01:07:37.429
'cause I learned that these
were state funded shelters.

01:07:37.638 --> 01:07:41.098
And I know that men pay
at least half of the taxes

01:07:41.308 --> 01:07:43.228
that fund these shelters
if they're state funded,

01:07:43.310 --> 01:07:45.060
and I just was wondering why.

01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:48.440
Basically, there was
no place to take him

01:07:48.649 --> 01:07:50.109
and it just continued.

01:07:50.317 --> 01:07:51.527
The problem just kept going.

01:07:57.282 --> 01:07:58.742
In the United States,

01:07:58.951 --> 01:08:03.751
there are over 2,000
domestic violence shelters.

01:08:03.956 --> 01:08:06.666
All of them serve
female victims,

01:08:06.875 --> 01:08:11.415
and nearly all of them
turn away male victims.

01:08:13.924 --> 01:08:17.144
In fact, as of 2016,

01:08:17.344 --> 01:08:20.764
<i>there's only a single domestic
violence shelter for men.</i>

01:08:22.933 --> 01:08:25.353
My initial reaction
was that there needed to be

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.560
thousands more women's shelters

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:31.020
because that many more women
are being battered.

01:08:31.233 --> 01:08:33.283
But as it turns out,

01:08:33.484 --> 01:08:37.354
one in three women
and one in four men

01:08:37.573 --> 01:08:39.783
will be victims
of physical violence

01:08:39.992 --> 01:08:42.792
by an intimate partner
in their lifetime.

01:08:42.995 --> 01:08:46.535
Sure, there's a slight
majority of female victims,

01:08:46.747 --> 01:08:50.417
but how can that excuse
deny men help?

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:53.337
Couldn't this be considered
gender discrimination?

01:08:58.426 --> 01:08:59.966
Think of it this way.

01:09:00.178 --> 01:09:04.058
Roughly 78°/o
of all suicides are men.

01:09:04.265 --> 01:09:08.595
If suicide prevention services
only served men,

01:09:08.812 --> 01:09:12.822
wouldn't we see the gender
discrimination immediately?

01:09:13.024 --> 01:09:15.814
If there are over 2,000
women's shelters

01:09:16.028 --> 01:09:17.988
that turn away men,

01:09:18.196 --> 01:09:20.616
and only one shelter for men,

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:23.913
obviously, the resources
don't match the need.

01:09:27.956 --> 01:09:31.416
How are you involved in
the men's rights movement?

01:09:31.627 --> 01:09:32.787
Well, from the very beginning

01:09:32.877 --> 01:09:34.207
when I first opened the refuge,

01:09:34.421 --> 01:09:38.430
which was in 1971
in chiswick in London,

01:09:38.634 --> 01:09:40.844
almost as soon
as I took the women in,

01:09:41.053 --> 01:09:44.223
I got a house for men.

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:47.640
A voice for men's
editor at large Erin pizzey

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:52.441
founded the first ever
women's shelter in 1971,

01:09:52.648 --> 01:09:55.648
and she is widely revered
in the men's rights community.

01:09:59.404 --> 01:10:01.494
<i>'Cause you see, what
1 knew from the beginning,</i>

01:10:01.698 --> 01:10:04.028
most domestic violence
is consensual.

01:10:04.201 --> 01:10:05.241
Both are involved.

01:10:05.452 --> 01:10:07.082
Sometimes one's the perpetrator,

01:10:07.287 --> 01:10:09.997
the other plays the victim,
then it crosses over.

01:10:10.207 --> 01:10:13.457
It's not as though it's just
all men or all women.

01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:17.049
It's both, and occasionally,
innocent victims...

01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:18.255
Very innocent.

01:10:22.094 --> 01:10:24.894
<i>Battered children grow up to
batter, that's what t. Learned,</i>

01:10:25.097 --> 01:10:27.017
whether it be a man or a woman.

01:10:27.224 --> 01:10:28.894
And I now know
that if a woman comes in

01:10:29.101 --> 01:10:32.021
with a history of violence
in her own childhood,

01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:34.689
chances are, she will be
probably violent to her children,

01:10:34.898 --> 01:10:38.068
<i>and she will want to live on this
knife edge of crisis and danger.</i>

01:10:40.987 --> 01:10:42.267
I haven't been allowed to speak.

01:10:42.406 --> 01:10:44.486
- That's the difficulty.
- Why is that?

01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:47.370
Because I'm completely barred
from all conferences.

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:49.907
I'm not allowed to walk up
the step of my own refuge.

01:10:50.122 --> 01:10:51.282
I bought the bloody building.

01:10:51.456 --> 01:10:53.286
But, no, because
there's feminists...

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:55.500
The woman who runs it
is very heavily feminist.

01:10:55.711 --> 01:10:57.191
She won't have anything
to do with me.

01:10:57.379 --> 01:11:00.629
What did you say
that made them hate you?

01:11:00.841 --> 01:11:02.931
That women could be
equally as violent as men...

01:11:03.135 --> 01:11:04.255
That was from the beginning.

01:11:13.478 --> 01:11:15.518
Erin pizzey says that 62

01:11:15.731 --> 01:11:19.111
of the first 100 women
to enter her refuge

01:11:19.276 --> 01:11:21.696
were just as violent
as the men they left,

01:11:21.903 --> 01:11:23.533
and violent towards
their children.

01:11:37.919 --> 01:11:39.339
Verbally, and...

01:11:41.798 --> 01:11:42.798
you know, very easily,

01:11:43.008 --> 01:11:44.178
and I've had an argument...

01:11:44.342 --> 01:11:45.842
But the feminists I've met

01:11:46.011 --> 01:11:48.311
have an entirely different take
on domestic violence.

01:11:56.062 --> 01:11:57.772
On the whole issue
of domestic violence...

01:11:57.981 --> 01:11:59.361
That's just another word,
really.

01:11:59.566 --> 01:12:01.986
It's a clean-up word
about wife beating,

01:12:02.194 --> 01:12:03.384
'cause that's really what it is.

01:12:03.403 --> 01:12:05.073
Or "dating violence."

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:07.570
And it's not girls
that are beating up on boys.

01:12:07.783 --> 01:12:09.413
It's boys that are
beating up on girls

01:12:09.618 --> 01:12:12.158
and using violence
to intimidate and to control.

01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:14.660
And we have very few

01:12:14.873 --> 01:12:16.793
what's called
domestic violence shelters,

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.590
which are places that women
can leave their home

01:12:19.795 --> 01:12:22.005
with their children
and get a new start,

01:12:22.214 --> 01:12:23.474
get out of the violence.

01:12:23.673 --> 01:12:26.093
But they're not nearly
enough of them.

01:12:26.301 --> 01:12:29.101
We need more funding
and more resources

01:12:29.304 --> 01:12:34.394
because it is
a tremendous disadvantage

01:12:34.601 --> 01:12:35.601
for women and girls.

01:12:47.572 --> 01:12:51.832
In 2014,
the coc released a report

01:12:52.035 --> 01:12:56.155
revealing that over
5.4 million men

01:12:56.373 --> 01:12:58.923
and 4.7 million women

01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:02.085
<i>had been victims of intimate
partner physical violence</i>

01:13:02.295 --> 01:13:04.545
within the previous 12 months.

01:13:04.756 --> 01:13:06.126
But then why does the media

01:13:06.341 --> 01:13:09.051
paint domestic violence
as a women's issue?

01:13:09.261 --> 01:13:10.981
<i>Reporter} The world
health organization says</i>

01:13:11.054 --> 01:13:13.644
one in three women
are abused by their partner.

01:13:13.849 --> 01:13:17.439
One in three American women
experiences domestic violence

01:13:17.644 --> 01:13:19.314
or stalking
at some point in her life.

01:13:19.521 --> 01:13:22.231
And when it was
addressed as a men's issue,

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:25.650
the speaker's point
was that it's a men's issue

01:13:25.861 --> 01:13:27.861
because men are the problem.

01:13:28.071 --> 01:13:29.201
I'm gonna share with you

01:13:29.406 --> 01:13:31.196
a paradigm shifting perspective

01:13:31.408 --> 01:13:32.698
on the issues
of gender violence.

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:34.269
I don't see these
as women's issues

01:13:34.411 --> 01:13:36.251
that some good men
help out with.

01:13:36.454 --> 01:13:38.474
In fact, I'm gonna argue
that these are men's issues.

01:13:38.498 --> 01:13:40.668
Why is domestic violence
still a big problem

01:13:40.876 --> 01:13:42.746
in the United States
and all over the world?

01:13:42.961 --> 01:13:45.091
<i>What's going on? Why do so
many men abuse physically,</i>

01:13:45.297 --> 01:13:47.257
emotionally, verbally,
and in other ways,

01:13:47.465 --> 01:13:49.065
the women and girls,
and the men and boys

01:13:49.092 --> 01:13:50.092
that they claim to love?

01:13:50.302 --> 01:13:52.892
What's going on with men?

01:13:53.096 --> 01:13:58.476
Let's Grant every single
empirical case as being true.

01:13:58.685 --> 01:14:00.595
Yes, it is true.
Let's just say...

01:14:00.812 --> 01:14:04.192
I mean, it is not true,
but let's just assume

01:14:04.399 --> 01:14:08.279
that there is gender symmetry
in domestic violence,

01:14:08.486 --> 01:14:11.316
that women hit men
as much as men hit women.

01:14:11.531 --> 01:14:13.741
If I were to say that,
I would say,

01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:18.120
therefore,
we need boatloads more funding

01:14:18.330 --> 01:14:20.250
for domestic violence

01:14:20.457 --> 01:14:23.167
to develop shelters
and adequate interventions,

01:14:23.376 --> 01:14:24.736
'cause there's
this hidden epidemic

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:27.710
of men who are being
beaten up by women.

01:14:27.923 --> 01:14:30.933
Or, I could say, as
the men's rights movement do,

01:14:31.134 --> 01:14:32.814
therefore, we shouldn't
have these shelters

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:35.509
and we shouldn't fund them
because the women are all lying.

01:14:35.722 --> 01:14:40.732
Well, it seems to me, that if you
really believe in gender symmetry,

01:14:40.936 --> 01:14:43.146
you're not questioning
the number of women.

01:14:43.355 --> 01:14:44.916
You're just saying
the number of men is...

01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:46.730
You would want to join
with women

01:14:46.942 --> 01:14:48.742
who are antmolence

01:14:48.944 --> 01:14:51.744
to say we have
a real problem here.

01:14:51.947 --> 01:14:53.947
It's not even a gender problem.

01:14:54.157 --> 01:14:56.438
<i>It's a problem of women hitting
men and men hitting women.</i>

01:14:56.534 --> 01:14:59.964
<i>We've gotta get boatloads more funding.
Let's work together.</i>

01:15:00.163 --> 01:15:02.123
That seems the logical
response to this.

01:15:02.332 --> 01:15:04.882
But instead they're saying,
it's like a zero sum game.

01:15:05.085 --> 01:15:09.455
If we fund the women,
then we're gonna ignore the men.

01:15:09.673 --> 01:15:12.183
<i>Well, we're not... we're not
gonna ignore the women,</i>

01:15:12.384 --> 01:15:15.684
'cause we all agree that the
levels are as high as we say.

01:15:18.723 --> 01:15:21.353
<i>[Lkyel but 1t does sound
like a zero sum game</i>

01:15:21.559 --> 01:15:23.979
when only women
are recemng services

01:15:24.187 --> 01:15:28.357
in domestic violence situations.

01:15:28.566 --> 01:15:30.566
And of all the men's rights
actmsts I've met,

01:15:30.777 --> 01:15:33.987
none of them question
the number of female victims.

01:15:34.197 --> 01:15:36.117
But they are calling attention
to the high number

01:15:36.199 --> 01:15:38.159
of male victims
that are being dismissed.

01:15:40.745 --> 01:15:42.745
So why aren't
men's rights actmsts

01:15:42.956 --> 01:15:44.956
and feminists working together?

01:15:47.752 --> 01:15:51.592
<i>Michael kimmel briefly said
something that made me wonder.</i>

01:15:51.798 --> 01:15:55.218
He said it would no longer
be a gender problem

01:15:55.427 --> 01:15:58.347
if both men and women were
equally victims

01:15:58.555 --> 01:16:01.215
of domestic violence.

01:16:01.433 --> 01:16:03.393
Is that why the number
of male victims

01:16:03.601 --> 01:16:05.231
are never addressed?

01:16:08.565 --> 01:16:11.475
To me, it's been fraud
for all these years.

01:16:11.693 --> 01:16:15.823
Why is it we have this enormously
powerful feminist movement

01:16:16.031 --> 01:16:18.411
and virtually nothing for men?

01:16:18.616 --> 01:16:21.036
Originally, it was capitalism

01:16:21.244 --> 01:16:24.004
was the big enemy
in the '60s and '70s.

01:16:24.205 --> 01:16:29.035
<i>And 1t was the radical feminists 1n
America that moved the goal post.</i>

01:16:29.252 --> 01:16:31.632
They said, no, it's no longer
capitalism is the enemy.

01:16:31.838 --> 01:16:35.258
The enemy is patriarchy...
Or men.

01:16:39.804 --> 01:16:42.474
And that's how
the women's movement began,

01:16:42.682 --> 01:16:45.022
and it was
enormously successful.

01:16:48.021 --> 01:16:51.071
The new mood in the refuges

01:16:51.274 --> 01:16:53.444
was gonna be that no man
could work in refuges,

01:16:53.651 --> 01:16:54.741
and can't today.

01:16:54.944 --> 01:16:56.324
They can't sit on the boards.

01:16:56.529 --> 01:16:57.859
And boys over 9,

01:16:58.073 --> 01:17:00.533
or possibly 12,
can't so into refuges.

01:17:00.742 --> 01:17:02.292
You call them shelters.

01:17:02.494 --> 01:17:04.474
Their mothers have to make
other arrangements for them,

01:17:04.496 --> 01:17:07.246
which I find shocking.

01:17:07.457 --> 01:17:10.997
And it ring-fenced money.

01:17:11.211 --> 01:17:13.711
I think that
that particular time

01:17:13.922 --> 01:17:16.002
when the feminist movement
were desperate for funding

01:17:16.091 --> 01:17:19.471
'cause they'd run out
of publicity...

01:17:19.636 --> 01:17:20.966
They were desperate for funding

01:17:21.179 --> 01:17:23.469
and they needed a just cause.

01:17:23.681 --> 01:17:26.521
And, unfortunately,
it fell into their laps.

01:17:26.726 --> 01:17:28.686
It's an enormous industry.

01:17:28.895 --> 01:17:31.185
1 mean,
"violence against women,"

01:17:31.356 --> 01:17:32.686
they get something like...

01:17:32.899 --> 01:17:34.899
Well, it's a billion
and over a year.

01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:36.320
Hmm.

01:17:36.528 --> 01:17:38.908
And an awful lot of that
goes on, really,

01:17:39.114 --> 01:17:40.704
supposedly rehabilitating men,

01:17:40.907 --> 01:17:42.327
but essentially punishing them

01:17:42.534 --> 01:17:45.914
with something that's called
the duluth model.

01:17:46.121 --> 01:17:48.361
Duluth power and control.
Well, you guys know about that?

01:17:48.498 --> 01:17:51.328
- No.
- I'll give you a copy.

01:17:51.543 --> 01:17:54.503
In 1977, I think, a bunch of crazy
women up in duluth, Minnesota,

01:17:54.671 --> 01:17:56.921
figured out they had the
solution to domestic violence

01:17:57.132 --> 01:17:59.132
and it was all about patriarchy

01:17:59.342 --> 01:18:01.512
and all about men.

01:18:01.719 --> 01:18:04.139
It's the duluth power
and control wheel,

01:18:04.347 --> 01:18:07.727
'cause men are all about
power and control.

01:18:07.934 --> 01:18:09.394
Of course, not you ladies.

01:18:09.602 --> 01:18:11.152
You guys, you don't
control anything.

01:18:11.354 --> 01:18:12.774
You have no power.

01:18:12.981 --> 01:18:14.542
You're just sweet
and innocent little things.

01:18:14.566 --> 01:18:17.146
Okay, so this power
and control wheel

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.200
is dmded up in all these things,

01:18:19.404 --> 01:18:21.134
you know, about who does
this and who does that,

01:18:21.156 --> 01:18:23.116
and blah, blah, blah.
And of course, it's all men.

01:18:41.342 --> 01:18:44.182
<i>The entire domestic violence
industry was founded on that.</i>

01:18:44.387 --> 01:18:45.427
I think it's still 37

01:18:45.638 --> 01:18:46.968
or 32 states
in the United States

01:18:47.182 --> 01:18:49.392
that by law they have to use
the duluth model

01:18:49.601 --> 01:18:51.311
for batter intervention program.

01:18:51.519 --> 01:18:54.189
It's all shame,
blame, and guilt driven.

01:18:54.397 --> 01:18:55.677
If you're a man and you walk in,

01:18:55.773 --> 01:18:57.403
you must admit
you did it up front

01:18:57.609 --> 01:18:58.989
or you're in denial.

01:18:59.194 --> 01:19:00.864
There's no debate.
There's no discussion.

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:03.310
There's no possibility that
you could be falsely accused,

01:19:03.489 --> 01:19:05.529
the criminal justice system
could've made a mistake.

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:07.790
None whatsoever.
You are in a state of denial,

01:19:07.994 --> 01:19:10.214
and you will complete
that course

01:19:10.413 --> 01:19:12.543
or you're gonna go to jail.

01:19:12.749 --> 01:19:15.589
You will be reengineered.

01:19:15.793 --> 01:19:18.173
That's frightening.

01:19:18.379 --> 01:19:20.009
- Frightening?
- Yes, that's frightening.

01:19:20.215 --> 01:19:21.505
I think it's terrifying.

01:19:23.718 --> 01:19:26.508
Absolutely terrifying.

01:19:28.223 --> 01:19:29.743
All I had to do,
I had a simple choice.

01:19:29.807 --> 01:19:31.227
I could just say,

01:19:31.434 --> 01:19:34.234
"yes, you're right.
Men are the enemy."

01:19:34.437 --> 01:19:36.017
No problem.
But I couldn't.

01:19:36.231 --> 01:19:37.771
I absolutely couldn't.

01:19:45.657 --> 01:19:49.037
Just getting overwhelmed,

01:19:49.244 --> 01:19:51.044
because...

01:19:54.791 --> 01:19:57.841
I don't know...

01:19:58.044 --> 01:20:01.264
Where I'm headed
with what I believe,

01:20:01.464 --> 01:20:03.474
and what is right
and what is wrong,

01:20:03.675 --> 01:20:06.215
and who is wrong
and who is right and...

01:20:17.021 --> 01:20:18.421
The truth is somewhere
in the middle

01:20:18.564 --> 01:20:22.284
and that's why
I'm feeling frustrated,

01:20:22.485 --> 01:20:26.485
because...

01:20:26.698 --> 01:20:28.028
I don't know where the truth is,

01:20:28.199 --> 01:20:29.989
and I don't know...

01:20:36.666 --> 01:20:38.666
When I decided to make a film

01:20:38.876 --> 01:20:41.496
on the men's rights movement,

01:20:41.713 --> 01:20:43.513
I never anticipated

01:20:43.715 --> 01:20:46.675
questioning my feminist views.

01:20:46.884 --> 01:20:48.974
But the more mras I met,

01:20:49.178 --> 01:20:50.888
the more I felt compelled

01:20:51.097 --> 01:20:54.307
to remind myself
why I was a feminist.

01:20:57.854 --> 01:21:01.484
I signed up for a women's group.

01:21:01.691 --> 01:21:05.111
<i>Welcome to our “women, own
your power“ workshop.</i>

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:10.660
<i>Only four percent of the fortune
50d companies are led by women.</i>

01:21:10.867 --> 01:21:14.697
Women only hold about 14°/o

01:21:14.871 --> 01:21:17.081
of corporate executive positions

01:21:17.290 --> 01:21:22.340
and less than 20°/o of
our governmental positions.

01:21:22.545 --> 01:21:24.585
<i>I made video diaries complaining</i>

01:21:24.797 --> 01:21:26.547
about how I had
to change what I wore

01:21:26.758 --> 01:21:28.048
to walk alone at night,

01:21:28.217 --> 01:21:32.097
how much time it took me
to get ready for work,

01:21:32.305 --> 01:21:34.765
all the housekeeping
that was on my shoulders.

01:21:34.932 --> 01:21:36.732
In comparison
to other gender issues,

01:21:36.934 --> 01:21:38.814
these videos seem trmal,

01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:41.940
but I made them nonetheless.

01:21:42.148 --> 01:21:45.108
I attended
women's rights rallies.

01:21:45.318 --> 01:21:46.488
No to violence.

01:21:46.694 --> 01:21:48.494
That's what we are here for,

01:21:48.696 --> 01:21:51.866
to say no more
to violence in any form,

01:21:52.075 --> 01:21:54.365
especially against women
and girls.

01:21:59.082 --> 01:22:01.172
I repeated
women's issues in my head

01:22:01.376 --> 01:22:03.286
like a broken record...

01:22:03.503 --> 01:22:04.923
Female genital mutilation,

01:22:05.129 --> 01:22:06.839
sex trafficking,
reproductive rights,

01:22:07.048 --> 01:22:09.218
maternity leave,

01:22:09.425 --> 01:22:12.635
and social media helped
remind me of women's issues.

01:22:12.845 --> 01:22:17.175
We have fought for everybody's
else's equal rights.

01:22:17.392 --> 01:22:22.152
<i>It's our time to have wage
equality once and for all,</i>

01:22:22.355 --> 01:22:24.185
and equal rights for women

01:22:24.399 --> 01:22:26.149
in the United States of America.

01:22:28.152 --> 01:22:31.612
We are struggling
for a uniting word.

01:22:31.823 --> 01:22:33.413
But the good news is

01:22:33.616 --> 01:22:37.196
that we have a uniting movement.

01:22:37.412 --> 01:22:39.042
It is called "he for she."

01:22:48.798 --> 01:22:52.638
Whenever I hear
the mras' point of view

01:22:52.844 --> 01:22:54.644
about how difficult
it is for them,

01:22:54.846 --> 01:22:57.266
I immediately go to,

01:22:57.473 --> 01:23:00.183
well, what about us?
What is like for us?

01:23:00.393 --> 01:23:01.813
And then I get on the defensive

01:23:02.019 --> 01:23:03.769
and want to make sure

01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:07.820
that women's struggles
are also heard.

01:23:08.025 --> 01:23:11.235
And I don't know
if that's necessary,

01:23:11.446 --> 01:23:13.696
because the mras are saying that

01:23:13.906 --> 01:23:18.236
the feminist perspective
is the mainstream perspective.

01:23:18.453 --> 01:23:20.413
But even when I hear
their issues,

01:23:20.621 --> 01:23:22.101
I still want to speak up
for the women

01:23:22.206 --> 01:23:24.666
because I feel like...
I don't know.

01:23:24.876 --> 01:23:26.996
I feel like talking
about one gender's issues

01:23:27.211 --> 01:23:28.671
now neglects the other,

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:30.880
and I guess that's what
mras have been dealing with

01:23:30.923 --> 01:23:32.403
is always hearing
about women's issues

01:23:32.467 --> 01:23:34.187
and feeling like
their issues are neglected.

01:23:34.302 --> 01:23:36.472
<i>But whenever 1 hear them
talk about men's issues,</i>

01:23:36.679 --> 01:23:38.679
I feel like I need to
stand up for women and say,

01:23:38.890 --> 01:23:39.680
"this is what
we're dealing with,

01:23:39.891 --> 01:23:42.271
an equal opposite."

01:23:46.647 --> 01:23:48.857
<i>1 met with men's rights
actmst Karen straughan</i>

01:23:49.066 --> 01:23:52.026
late one night in a noisy bar.

01:23:52.236 --> 01:23:55.026
She became well known
for her YouTube videos

01:23:55.239 --> 01:23:56.869
talking about male disposability

01:23:57.074 --> 01:23:59.294
and other men's rights issues,

01:23:59.494 --> 01:24:02.044
and she's a honey badger.

01:24:02.246 --> 01:24:03.326
Part of what I do,

01:24:03.539 --> 01:24:04.850
what I research,
and what I think about

01:24:04.874 --> 01:24:08.094
is the reason psychologically

01:24:08.294 --> 01:24:10.844
why feminism seems to be

01:24:11.047 --> 01:24:14.087
such a comfortable
warm blanket emotionally

01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:17.800
for so many people,
men and women alike.

01:24:18.012 --> 01:24:22.892
And it's so comfortable

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:26.100
that it will make them
not see things

01:24:26.312 --> 01:24:27.812
that are right in front
of their face.

01:24:28.022 --> 01:24:30.112
Look at boko haram.

01:24:30.316 --> 01:24:33.526
Hundreds of young
girls fast asleep in their beds

01:24:33.736 --> 01:24:35.986
are awakened
by the sound of gunfire.

01:24:36.197 --> 01:24:38.157
Armed attackers have stormed
their boarding school

01:24:38.324 --> 01:24:40.704
and set fire to dozens
of buildings.

01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:44.710
<i>Nearly 300 of them are dragged from
their dorm, loaded on to trucks,</i>

01:24:44.914 --> 01:24:47.004
and carried away
deep into the forest.

01:24:47.208 --> 01:24:49.311
<i>Mevoanaa} ...From New York
to London rallied yesterday</i>

01:24:49.335 --> 01:24:53.625
<i>demanding that the terrorist group
boko haram bring back our girls.</i>

01:24:53.839 --> 01:24:56.179
It just gets to the core of you.

01:24:56.384 --> 01:24:58.264
This unconscionable act

01:24:58.427 --> 01:25:00.677
was committed
by a terrorist group

01:25:00.888 --> 01:25:03.808
<i>determined to keep these girls
from getting an education.</i>

01:25:04.016 --> 01:25:08.766
And what happened in Nigeria
was not an isolated incident.

01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:11.980
It is a story we see every day,

01:25:12.191 --> 01:25:14.571
as girls around the world
risk their lives

01:25:14.777 --> 01:25:16.947
to pursue their ambitions.

01:25:17.154 --> 01:25:19.824
I mean, you must have heard
about all of that, right?

01:25:20.032 --> 01:25:23.952
That's being spun as a
fundamentalist islamic group

01:25:24.161 --> 01:25:27.541
that is so determined
to be misogynistic

01:25:27.748 --> 01:25:28.958
and oppress girls

01:25:29.166 --> 01:25:31.246
that they want to
deny girls an education.

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:34.800
But they are not against
girls being educated.

01:25:35.006 --> 01:25:40.296
<i>They're against anybody getting a
western secular or Christian education.</i>

01:25:40.511 --> 01:25:42.851
The initial attacks,
and there were several of them,

01:25:43.055 --> 01:25:45.595
there was one... there were
over a hundred men killed

01:25:45.808 --> 01:25:47.728
and one woman killed.

01:25:47.935 --> 01:25:51.725
And the victims were
described as "people," right?

01:25:51.939 --> 01:25:53.569
Or "villagers."

01:25:53.774 --> 01:25:57.824
And in the previous attacks
on the schools,

01:25:58.029 --> 01:26:00.409
they actually let the girls go.

01:26:00.615 --> 01:26:03.405
They separated out
the boys and the girls

01:26:03.618 --> 01:26:06.198
and they let the girls go,
and they told them,

01:26:06.412 --> 01:26:09.582
"go home, get married,"

01:26:09.790 --> 01:26:11.790
renounce your sins,

01:26:12.001 --> 01:26:15.631
"and live a righteous life
under Allah," right?

01:26:15.838 --> 01:26:18.628
And then they burned
the boys alive.

01:26:18.841 --> 01:26:21.431
There was literally no outrage.

01:26:21.636 --> 01:26:23.466
It was barely reported on.

01:26:23.679 --> 01:26:26.033
It was one of those things, there
was no opinion pieces on it,

01:26:26.057 --> 01:26:27.427
no nothing, right?

01:26:27.642 --> 01:26:30.442
Until the girls were kidnapped.

01:26:30.645 --> 01:26:31.845
And look at it this way,

01:26:32.063 --> 01:26:34.023
because we played right
into their hands.

01:26:34.231 --> 01:26:36.441
Because they
want attention, right?

01:26:36.651 --> 01:26:40.241
And they weren't getting any
attention from the western media

01:26:40.446 --> 01:26:42.366
when they were
just slaughtering boys.

01:26:42.573 --> 01:26:44.453
- Yeah.
- Right?

01:26:44.659 --> 01:26:46.119
They want attention.

01:26:46.327 --> 01:26:48.247
And what do they do?
They kidnap girls

01:26:48.454 --> 01:26:51.214
and sell them into
marriage or slavery, right?

01:26:51.415 --> 01:26:54.245
And everybody... the u.N.,

01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:56.800
Michelle Obama, Barack Obama,

01:26:57.004 --> 01:27:00.474
<i>the u.K. Government, the Canadian
federal minister of defense,</i>

01:27:00.675 --> 01:27:03.465
they're all promising aid
and help and equipment

01:27:03.678 --> 01:27:07.058
<i>and personnel to help find these
girls and bring them back,</i>

01:27:07.264 --> 01:27:08.814
because this is such an outrage,

01:27:09.016 --> 01:27:11.306
and, "oh, my goodness,
something needs to be done."

01:27:11.519 --> 01:27:15.309
Well, maybe if, like, last year,

01:27:15.523 --> 01:27:17.483
maybe if we did something then,

01:27:17.692 --> 01:27:22.862
<i>all of these girls would be safe
1n their dorms right now, right?</i>

01:27:23.072 --> 01:27:24.372
But we didn't.

01:27:24.573 --> 01:27:26.703
And the reason why
they kidnapped those girls

01:27:26.909 --> 01:27:28.659
is because we didn't
do anything.

01:27:28.869 --> 01:27:32.869
We didn't pay attention,
and they want attention.

01:27:33.082 --> 01:27:35.922
And they know that
attacking girls or women

01:27:36.127 --> 01:27:38.707
is gonna get them attention.

01:27:38.921 --> 01:27:42.591
<i>What are we gonna do? Start a
campaign, “bring back our boys“?</i>

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:46.930
Oh, wait, they're dead.
Never mind, right?

01:27:47.138 --> 01:27:50.308
The men...
The people in boko haram,

01:27:50.516 --> 01:27:52.686
they're chivalrous.

01:27:52.893 --> 01:27:54.523
If those girls were boys,

01:27:54.729 --> 01:27:56.309
they wouldn't be
getting education,

01:27:56.522 --> 01:27:58.862
they'd be dead.

01:27:59.066 --> 01:28:00.386
They wouldn't be sold
into slavery

01:28:00.526 --> 01:28:04.316
with the hope of escape.
They'd be dead.

01:28:04.530 --> 01:28:05.910
Boko haram has been fighting

01:28:06.115 --> 01:28:09.905
for islamic rule
in Nigeria since 2002.

01:28:10.119 --> 01:28:12.289
Its members have killed
hundreds of people.

01:28:27.762 --> 01:28:29.142
At least 69 dead,

01:28:29.346 --> 01:28:31.766
although some reports put
the number at about 150

01:28:31.974 --> 01:28:34.694
and scores more injured.

01:29:59.562 --> 01:30:02.062
One of the most important things
the men's movement is doing

01:30:02.273 --> 01:30:06.243
is being able to say
men need compassion

01:30:06.443 --> 01:30:09.363
and men deserve compassion.

01:30:09.572 --> 01:30:11.662
And to have that happen,

01:30:11.866 --> 01:30:14.196
I'm not expecting it
in my lifetime.

01:30:16.036 --> 01:30:18.366
It's an ocean of pain out there.

01:30:18.581 --> 01:30:21.881
This stuff we're talking about

01:30:22.084 --> 01:30:25.924
has been going on for so long,

01:30:26.130 --> 01:30:30.890
and nobody listens,
nobody cares.

01:30:31.093 --> 01:30:36.473
<i>It's one thing when you look
at what happens to women</i>

01:30:36.682 --> 01:30:39.562
and you feel normal
healthy outrage about it,

01:30:39.768 --> 01:30:41.438
and that should happen.

01:30:41.645 --> 01:30:43.081
But when you can look at
what's happening

01:30:43.105 --> 01:30:44.605
in our courts to men,

01:30:44.815 --> 01:30:46.895
in our medical
establishment to men,

01:30:47.109 --> 01:30:48.899
in our schools to men,

01:30:49.111 --> 01:30:51.951
and yet we remain
so cerebral about all of it,

01:30:52.114 --> 01:30:55.914
yes, well, that is certainly
something to consider.

01:30:56.118 --> 01:30:59.038
If it were happening
to any other group,

01:30:59.246 --> 01:31:02.206
we would be having protests
from coast to coast.

01:31:02.416 --> 01:31:05.416
And the fact is that
it is happening to men

01:31:05.628 --> 01:31:07.918
every day right
in front of our eyes,

01:31:08.130 --> 01:31:11.300
and people will get angry at you
if you try to talk about it.

01:31:11.508 --> 01:31:14.138
That's how deep
the prejudice runs.

01:31:18.098 --> 01:31:20.638
But there have been protests,

01:31:20.851 --> 01:31:24.521
<i>not with the intention of
shining light on men's issues,</i>

01:31:24.730 --> 01:31:26.940
but rather with
the goal of silencing

01:31:27.149 --> 01:31:30.739
any discussion of men's issues.

01:31:30.945 --> 01:31:32.525
Like at Ottawa university,

01:31:32.738 --> 01:31:35.568
when professor Janice flamengo
attempted to give a lecture

01:31:35.783 --> 01:31:38.793
that questioned
the feminist narrative.

01:31:38.994 --> 01:31:40.334
We'll take a moment

01:31:40.496 --> 01:31:44.786
until we enforce
some decorum in the room.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.960
So you think this is a victory?

01:31:47.169 --> 01:31:48.549
<i>What are you so frightened of...</i>

01:31:48.754 --> 01:31:50.344
Yeah, why are you so frightened

01:31:50.506 --> 01:31:53.756
of hearing an opinion
different from your own?

01:31:53.968 --> 01:31:56.008
<i>Then there was the first
international conference</i>

01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:59.310
on men's issues in Michigan,

01:31:59.515 --> 01:32:01.845
where even "Ms. magazine"
urged its readers

01:32:02.059 --> 01:32:05.229
to protest the conference
in hopes of shutting it down.

01:32:18.951 --> 01:32:21.371
But perhaps the most
well known protest

01:32:21.578 --> 01:32:23.458
of a pro men's rights event

01:32:23.664 --> 01:32:27.884
happened in April, 2013,
at the university of Toronto,

01:32:28.085 --> 01:32:30.205
when the Canadian
association for equality

01:32:30.421 --> 01:32:32.591
hosted a discussion titled

01:32:32.798 --> 01:32:37.008
"from misogyny and misandry
to intersexual dialogue."

01:32:51.984 --> 01:32:54.034
Fuck the patriarchy!

01:32:56.822 --> 01:32:58.822
Women hold up half the sky!

01:33:01.035 --> 01:33:03.035
Women hold up half the sky!

01:33:04.997 --> 01:33:06.707
Women hold up half the sky!

01:33:09.251 --> 01:33:11.841
Women hold up half the sky!

01:33:13.839 --> 01:33:16.469
<i>A feminist group
protesting the event</i>

01:33:16.675 --> 01:33:18.255
illegally pulled the fire alarm

01:33:18.469 --> 01:33:20.719
and successfully
shut down the event.

01:33:31.023 --> 01:33:34.863
Okay, let's go.
We got a fire alarm!

01:33:35.069 --> 01:33:36.699
Once outside the lecture hall,

01:33:36.904 --> 01:33:39.364
feminist protesters
and men's rights actmsts

01:33:39.573 --> 01:33:42.453
got to speak face to face.

01:33:42.659 --> 01:33:44.659
So, number one.
Number one!

01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:47.870
Shut the fuck up for a second.

01:33:48.082 --> 01:33:51.042
<i>Feminists do not want you to
lose custody of your children.</i>

01:33:51.251 --> 01:33:53.961
The assumption that women
are naturally better caregivers

01:33:54.171 --> 01:33:56.761
is part of patriarchy.

01:33:56.965 --> 01:33:58.465
Feminists do not like
commercials

01:33:58.675 --> 01:34:00.585
in which bumbling dads
mess up the laundry

01:34:00.803 --> 01:34:03.353
and competent wives have
to bustle in and fix it.

01:34:03.555 --> 01:34:07.935
The assumption that women...
This is a list

01:34:08.143 --> 01:34:09.983
of the things
that we're working toward.

01:34:10.187 --> 01:34:11.897
Now if you would
shut the fuck up

01:34:12.106 --> 01:34:13.896
for the 50th billionth time...

01:34:14.108 --> 01:34:15.502
These are things
we agree on, actually.

01:34:15.526 --> 01:34:17.896
These are things
that we're agreeing on,

01:34:18.112 --> 01:34:21.322
<i>and these are things you've all
got skewed fucking views on.</i>

01:34:21.532 --> 01:34:24.332
<i>You think that feminists are trying
to take away your fucking rights,</i>

01:34:24.535 --> 01:34:26.695
but as a matter of fact,
what we're trying to do

01:34:26.912 --> 01:34:29.062
<i>1s we're actually trying to work on the
same things that you're working on,</i>

01:34:29.081 --> 01:34:30.621
except the fact
that you're so...

01:34:30.833 --> 01:34:32.333
You're just too busy
hating women...

01:34:32.543 --> 01:34:34.463
You're a fucking hate group.

01:34:34.670 --> 01:34:36.272
<i>You can't see we're trying to
work on those same situations.</i>

01:34:36.296 --> 01:34:38.966
Are you conflating feminism,
which is an ideology,

01:34:39.174 --> 01:34:41.894
with women, which is
a demographic of society?

01:34:42.094 --> 01:34:43.454
Okay, mister
derailing for dummies.

01:34:43.470 --> 01:34:45.070
So, really, your hatred
is for feminists.

01:34:45.139 --> 01:34:47.809
- You're still a hate group.
- An ideology, yes.

01:34:48.016 --> 01:34:49.536
I hate also hate
a lot of other "isms".

01:34:49.643 --> 01:34:51.443
- So you admit, though.
- Racism, sexism.

01:34:51.645 --> 01:34:53.145
Oh, bullshit, bullshit.

01:34:53.355 --> 01:34:55.355
Bullshit, you hate sexism,
but you're an mra.

01:34:55.566 --> 01:34:57.936
Okay, no. Point taken.
We... like, we win.

01:34:58.152 --> 01:34:59.712
You obviously haven't read
our literature.

01:34:59.736 --> 01:35:01.236
Sorry. Okay!

01:35:01.446 --> 01:35:03.526
You don't actually work
on anything.

01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:05.620
You're creating any change
in the fucking world.

01:35:05.701 --> 01:35:07.061
Your website,
your fucking website,

01:35:07.161 --> 01:35:08.601
the hate website
against feminists...

01:35:08.787 --> 01:35:10.014
You're not actually
creating any change.

01:35:10.038 --> 01:35:12.538
Feminists do not want you

01:35:12.749 --> 01:35:14.169
to have to make
alimony payments.

01:35:14.376 --> 01:35:16.496
Alimony is set up
to combat the fact

01:35:16.712 --> 01:35:18.352
that women have been
historically expected

01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:21.180
to prioritize domestic duties
over professional goals,

01:35:21.383 --> 01:35:22.973
thus minimizing
their earning potential

01:35:23.177 --> 01:35:24.547
if their traditional
marriages end.

01:35:24.761 --> 01:35:26.601
I'm right here.
You don't have to yell.

01:35:26.805 --> 01:35:28.965
I'm reading, fuckface.

01:35:29.183 --> 01:35:30.994
- It's for the fucking camera.
- I'm trying to fucking...

01:35:31.018 --> 01:35:33.188
I'm letting everyone else
hear it, okay?

01:35:33.395 --> 01:35:35.645
It's not just for you,
mister entitled.

01:35:35.856 --> 01:35:38.186
The assumption
that wives should...

01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:40.610
Why do you think
the men's rights movement

01:35:40.777 --> 01:35:42.907
is at odds with feminism?

01:35:43.113 --> 01:35:46.453
What has created that clash,
that war between each other?

01:35:46.658 --> 01:35:50.788
Well, one, feminism
has spent the last 50 years

01:35:50.954 --> 01:35:54.124
<i>demonizing men, which 1s
sort of one of the problems.</i>

01:35:54.333 --> 01:35:56.793
Feminist scholars
have characterized men

01:35:57.002 --> 01:35:59.302
as inherently violent,
inherently bad,

01:35:59.504 --> 01:36:02.134
inherently predatory,
inherently oppressive.

01:36:02.341 --> 01:36:05.761
They have postulated that
masculinity is a disease.

01:36:05.969 --> 01:36:09.309
Feminists aren't
the only problem.

01:36:09.514 --> 01:36:11.524
The problems didn't start
with feminism.

01:36:11.725 --> 01:36:13.805
So when I start
criticizing feminism,

01:36:14.019 --> 01:36:19.229
<i>1 want you to know you're
just part of the problem.</i>

01:36:19.441 --> 01:36:20.861
They're just part
of the problem.

01:36:21.068 --> 01:36:23.818
You calling men oppressors

01:36:24.029 --> 01:36:27.449
and women oppressed
demonizes men,

01:36:27.658 --> 01:36:30.618
and I believe diminishes
women at the same time.

01:36:30.786 --> 01:36:32.656
It's a way of telling men
to shut up.

01:36:32.871 --> 01:36:34.081
It's a way of telling men

01:36:34.289 --> 01:36:35.789
that their experiences
don't matter.

01:36:35.999 --> 01:36:37.959
You tell a man he's prmleged,

01:36:38.168 --> 01:36:40.338
therefore, anything
he's gone through

01:36:40.545 --> 01:36:42.455
or anything he has to say
doesn't matter.

01:36:42.673 --> 01:36:44.263
His lived experiences
don't matter

01:36:44.466 --> 01:36:45.676
because he's prmleged.

01:36:49.638 --> 01:36:52.518
<i>So how old were you when you started
calling yourself a feminist?</i>

01:36:52.724 --> 01:36:54.854
Or how many years ago?

01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:59.060
It was probably, about three
years agc, I guess you can say.

01:36:59.273 --> 01:37:01.783
I'm relatively new, yeah.

01:37:01.984 --> 01:37:04.284
But I'm pretty loud, so...

01:37:04.486 --> 01:37:07.446
Silence only helps the
oppressor, not the oppressed.

01:37:07.656 --> 01:37:09.276
<i>A lot of mras say that feminism</i>

01:37:09.491 --> 01:37:11.491
doesn't fight
for the rights of men.

01:37:11.702 --> 01:37:13.082
What would you say to that?

01:37:13.287 --> 01:37:15.247
Cry me a river, really,

01:37:15.455 --> 01:37:17.615
because feminism is a movement

01:37:17.833 --> 01:37:19.963
about the discrepancies

01:37:20.168 --> 01:37:23.708
when it comes
to women's equality.

01:37:23.922 --> 01:37:26.802
Because we're not up.
We're still not there yet.

01:37:27.009 --> 01:37:30.299
You know, don't even
start with that whole

01:37:30.512 --> 01:37:32.282
"oh, but you don't think
about the men's issue."

01:37:32.306 --> 01:37:33.766
Well, then you know what?

01:37:33.974 --> 01:37:36.104
Start your own goddamn
movement, which they have,

01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:39.400
<i>but maybe make 1t a little
more about legitimate issues</i>

01:37:39.604 --> 01:37:41.694
like custody and alimony

01:37:41.898 --> 01:37:43.898
and things that
you think are unequal,

01:37:44.109 --> 01:37:45.989
which all stem from patriarchy,

01:37:46.194 --> 01:37:48.034
not from, "oh, my god",

01:37:48.238 --> 01:37:50.698
feminists are trying
to take away our kids."

01:37:50.866 --> 01:37:52.526
No, dipshit.

01:37:52.743 --> 01:37:54.203
That's not what
we're trying to do.

01:37:54.411 --> 01:37:55.751
We're not trying to do that.

01:37:55.912 --> 01:37:58.792
I mean, if they look
at the root causes of why,

01:37:58.999 --> 01:38:04.549
for example, women get custody
more often than men do,

01:38:04.755 --> 01:38:06.465
women are supposed to
be the mothers.

01:38:06.673 --> 01:38:08.803
They're supposed to be
the natural born caregivers.

01:38:09.009 --> 01:38:11.549
So, obviously, duh,
you has a vagina,

01:38:11.762 --> 01:38:14.722
so, obviously, you're gonna be
able to take care of the kiddies.

01:38:14.931 --> 01:38:16.351
That's really what it is.

01:38:16.558 --> 01:38:18.938
It all stems from
sexism against women.

01:38:19.144 --> 01:38:24.364
It's just, the oppression
dialectic needs to go.

01:38:24.566 --> 01:38:28.146
It's so hard to convince people

01:38:28.362 --> 01:38:30.862
to look at men's rights
actmsm and support it

01:38:31.073 --> 01:38:35.123
without first allowing them
to at least escape

01:38:35.327 --> 01:38:39.917
<i>the stranglehold that
feminism has on their minds.</i>

01:38:40.123 --> 01:38:43.673
I do believe it is dogma.
It's zealotry.

01:38:43.877 --> 01:38:46.917
There are good people
in the feminist movement.

01:38:48.757 --> 01:38:50.587
Um...

01:38:50.801 --> 01:38:51.841
There are not good people

01:38:52.052 --> 01:38:53.552
in the radical
feminist movement.

01:38:55.555 --> 01:38:58.975
Um...

01:38:59.184 --> 01:39:01.404
That system is based on hate,

01:39:01.603 --> 01:39:03.613
and hate... in my opinion,

01:39:03.814 --> 01:39:05.984
hate's the most destructive
force in the world.

01:39:06.191 --> 01:39:08.531
They're so quick to call us

01:39:08.735 --> 01:39:10.775
man-haters or misandrists.

01:39:10.946 --> 01:39:13.196
Misandry for life.
No.

01:39:13.407 --> 01:39:14.617
They're so quick to say that,

01:39:14.825 --> 01:39:16.485
when all we're doing
is talking about

01:39:16.701 --> 01:39:18.951
patriarchal societies
and structures

01:39:19.162 --> 01:39:22.372
that we want to dismantle.

01:39:22.624 --> 01:39:24.634
Nothing against men
in particular,

01:39:24.835 --> 01:39:27.115
but just saying, hey, this is
the system that we live in

01:39:27.212 --> 01:39:28.802
and this puts men above women.

01:39:29.005 --> 01:39:30.795
And it's not necessarily
their fault,

01:39:30.966 --> 01:39:33.006
but, hey, recognize
what's happening here

01:39:33.218 --> 01:39:35.218
and let's work together
to dismantle it.

01:39:35.429 --> 01:39:39.219
The omnipotent,
ever-present patriarchy,

01:39:39.433 --> 01:39:42.813
the invisible force that directs

01:39:43.019 --> 01:39:45.269
all of our lives, right?

01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:49.030
And causes all oppression
and all suffering, right?

01:39:49.234 --> 01:39:51.534
Our devil.

01:39:51.736 --> 01:39:56.366
And the beautiful,
wonderful force for justice...

01:39:56.575 --> 01:39:59.035
Feminism, the way.

01:39:59.244 --> 01:40:01.544
It's the way.

01:40:01.746 --> 01:40:05.076
It sounds like religion.
It sounds like religion.

01:40:08.420 --> 01:40:09.670
And, oh, my goodness,

01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:12.590
for a moment that's only
about equality

01:40:12.799 --> 01:40:14.259
and isn't blaming of men,

01:40:14.468 --> 01:40:17.048
they named the force
for evil after men

01:40:17.262 --> 01:40:19.392
and the force for justice
after women.

01:41:07.687 --> 01:41:09.897
They're really angry,
and they're angry at women,

01:41:10.106 --> 01:41:12.186
they're angry at feminist women.

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:16.110
Yes, men have gotten
a crappy deal,

01:41:16.321 --> 01:41:19.411
but it's not the fault
of women or gay people.

01:41:19.616 --> 01:41:23.116
When feminism says that they
have no part in any of this,

01:41:23.328 --> 01:41:26.078
I think they're not
being honest about it.

01:41:26.289 --> 01:41:28.329
I don't blame feminism
for all of it,

01:41:28.542 --> 01:41:30.542
but I think they've had
a role in it.

01:41:30.752 --> 01:41:32.922
They've written laws
that discriminate against men.

01:41:33.129 --> 01:41:35.129
They've fought
to protect those laws,

01:41:35.340 --> 01:41:37.550
particularly
in domestic violence areas.

01:41:37.759 --> 01:41:40.929
And for many, many years,
second wave feminism

01:41:41.096 --> 01:41:42.556
would go through the statutes

01:41:42.764 --> 01:41:44.934
and change everything
that was gender specific

01:41:45.141 --> 01:41:46.641
to something gender neutral

01:41:46.851 --> 01:41:48.611
unless it was something
that benefited women,

01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:50.150
like the domestic violence laws.

01:41:50.355 --> 01:41:52.225
They didn't change those.

01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.570
Other types of areas,
like fathers in prison,

01:41:54.776 --> 01:41:57.566
there are statutes that specifically
give mothers certain benefits

01:41:57.779 --> 01:42:00.159
that fathers in prison
don't have.

01:42:00.365 --> 01:42:01.759
And I challenged that
as well, legally,

01:42:01.783 --> 01:42:03.083
but we didn't win on that one.

01:42:03.285 --> 01:42:05.035
When I wanted to get
a commission on men

01:42:05.245 --> 01:42:06.885
like the county has
a commission on women,

01:42:07.038 --> 01:42:10.168
the feminists fought that
tooth and nail.

01:42:10.375 --> 01:42:13.955
When prop 209 was before
the California voters,

01:42:14.170 --> 01:42:16.090
which was to end
affirmative action,

01:42:16.298 --> 01:42:20.588
every feminist
organization opposed it.

01:42:20.802 --> 01:42:22.852
Every time men's rights groups

01:42:23.054 --> 01:42:25.604
try to pass
joint custody legislation,

01:42:25.807 --> 01:42:27.597
feminist groups fight them.

01:42:27.809 --> 01:42:30.059
They fought us
on paternity fraud.

01:42:30.270 --> 01:42:33.150
The biggest opposition
that I have faced

01:42:33.356 --> 01:42:35.976
has been from the radical
feminists that said,

01:42:36.151 --> 01:42:38.401
"we don't want truth
to be the standard."

01:42:38.612 --> 01:42:41.202
Because if we did,
they wouldn't oppose

01:42:41.406 --> 01:42:43.406
automatic DNA testing at birth.

01:42:43.617 --> 01:42:46.197
And in countries like France,

01:42:46.411 --> 01:42:50.331
they're saying, "well,
DNA should mean 'do not ask,"'

01:42:50.540 --> 01:42:54.000
'cause it's now illegal
to even get a test.

01:42:54.210 --> 01:42:58.090
And if you get a test without
the mother's permission,

01:42:58.298 --> 01:42:59.918
you will be
criminally prosecuted.

01:43:03.178 --> 01:43:06.558
In sweden, they
tried to create a man tax.

01:43:06.765 --> 01:43:09.225
<i>In India, the men's rights
movement is trying to get</i>

01:43:09.434 --> 01:43:12.854
the rape laws
to include male victims,

01:43:13.063 --> 01:43:16.443
and the feminist groups
apparently are fighting that.

01:43:16.650 --> 01:43:18.860
I'm not saying
all feminists are this way.

01:43:19.069 --> 01:43:23.449
But I think the ones who
are affecting public policy,

01:43:23.657 --> 01:43:26.527
who have the lobbying power,
I think they are.

01:43:26.743 --> 01:43:28.663
If you just look
at their actions,

01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:30.620
they don't want
equality for women.

01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:34.460
They want special prmleges
for women and girls.

01:43:34.668 --> 01:43:37.458
And even though they know
in a lot of areas

01:43:37.671 --> 01:43:41.091
men do not have equality,
they are silent.

01:43:43.218 --> 01:43:44.498
The commander
of the marine corps

01:43:44.636 --> 01:43:46.046
said that he thinks,
and I quote,

01:43:46.221 --> 01:43:48.681
<i>“ all eligible and
qualified men and women</i>

01:43:48.890 --> 01:43:50.117
"should register for the draft,"

01:43:50.141 --> 01:43:51.481
talking about selective service.

01:43:51.685 --> 01:43:53.595
Do you think women
should also have to register

01:43:53.812 --> 01:43:55.402
for selective service like men?

01:43:55.605 --> 01:43:59.275
I have to think about whether
I think it's necessary

01:43:59.484 --> 01:44:05.244
<i>to go as far as our military
officers are recommending.</i>

01:44:05.448 --> 01:44:09.578
The idea of having
everybody register

01:44:09.786 --> 01:44:11.156
concerns me a little bit,

01:44:11.371 --> 01:44:13.041
unless we have a better idea

01:44:13.248 --> 01:44:14.668
of where that's gonna come out.

01:44:14.874 --> 01:44:16.504
Where I want people to register,

01:44:16.710 --> 01:44:19.420
I want every young person
to register at the age of 18

01:44:19.587 --> 01:44:21.167
to be able to vote
automatically.

01:44:21.381 --> 01:44:23.511
And I think if...

01:44:28.638 --> 01:44:30.098
What's the motivation?

01:44:30.306 --> 01:44:31.926
People don't ask,
what's the motivation?

01:44:32.142 --> 01:44:33.292
Do we need
a men's rights moment?

01:44:33.309 --> 01:44:36.099
No. We need common sense.

01:44:36.271 --> 01:44:38.521
But if there's gonna be
this woman's movement

01:44:38.732 --> 01:44:41.942
and this is the movement that's
gonna do all these things,

01:44:42.152 --> 01:44:43.952
then maybe we need
a counterbalance,

01:44:44.154 --> 01:44:45.954
something called
a men's rights movement,

01:44:46.156 --> 01:44:48.116
or men's movement.

01:44:48.324 --> 01:44:50.124
I hate to see
either one of them.

01:44:50.326 --> 01:44:52.906
I think it's a shame.
I think it's destructive.

01:45:01.296 --> 01:45:05.336
I'm hearing what the men's
rights actmsts are saying.

01:45:05.550 --> 01:45:07.050
And I'm finding the sources

01:45:07.260 --> 01:45:09.140
to support what they're saying.

01:45:09.345 --> 01:45:11.765
Men are just as likely
to be victims

01:45:11.973 --> 01:45:15.143
of intimate partner
physical violence.

01:45:15.351 --> 01:45:19.401
Men have little to no control
over their parental destiny,

01:45:19.606 --> 01:45:22.066
especially when he's tricked
into fatherhood

01:45:22.275 --> 01:45:23.565
or he's raising a child

01:45:23.777 --> 01:45:27.157
that he later finds out
isn't his.

01:45:27.363 --> 01:45:29.573
The sentencing disparity
between men and women

01:45:29.783 --> 01:45:32.993
is six times larger
than the sentencing disparity

01:45:33.203 --> 01:45:36.043
between blacks and whites.

01:45:36.247 --> 01:45:38.367
So while a black man
may be sentenced

01:45:38.583 --> 01:45:40.383
to ten percent more prison time

01:45:40.585 --> 01:45:43.585
for the same crime
as a white man,

01:45:43.797 --> 01:45:48.007
a man is sentenced
to over 60°/o more prison time

01:45:48.218 --> 01:45:51.048
than a woman arrested
for the same crime.

01:45:52.764 --> 01:45:55.394
Boys are falling behind
in education.

01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:57.810
They are enrolling
at lower rates

01:45:58.019 --> 01:46:01.399
and earning
less college degrees.

01:46:01.606 --> 01:46:04.106
And while not all mras
agree on the issue

01:46:04.317 --> 01:46:06.397
of infant male circumcision,

01:46:06.611 --> 01:46:11.201
most mras do believe it is
a human rights violation.

01:46:11.366 --> 01:46:14.696
I spent months learning about
infant male circumcision,

01:46:14.911 --> 01:46:17.461
but it only took me
watching a five-minute

01:46:17.664 --> 01:46:20.714
medical training video
to convince me

01:46:20.917 --> 01:46:23.997
this is a barbaric practice
that needs to stop.

01:46:24.212 --> 01:46:27.052
Okay, so first thing,
make sure he's well restrained.

01:46:27.257 --> 01:46:30.427
So the foreskin. Okay?

01:46:30.635 --> 01:46:33.635
And we repeat the process with
just one end on and clamp.

01:46:33.847 --> 01:46:35.517
Anything that gets clamped
gets cut.

01:46:35.723 --> 01:46:37.233
<i>All that was
left, a partial penis</i>

01:46:37.433 --> 01:46:39.143
and his tiny testicles.

01:46:39.352 --> 01:46:43.062
Rhodes says Ashton urinates
through a hole in his penis.

01:46:43.273 --> 01:46:45.653
She says she can't imagine now
what she'll say to her son

01:46:45.859 --> 01:46:47.044
when he's old enough
to understand

01:46:47.068 --> 01:46:48.148
what's happened to him.

01:46:48.361 --> 01:46:50.071
How could you explain it
to your child

01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:51.530
that you don't have a penis

01:46:51.739 --> 01:46:54.329
or you might never be
able to have kids?

01:47:03.251 --> 01:47:05.461
Yes, men are the majority

01:47:05.670 --> 01:47:08.590
of workplace deaths
and injuries,

01:47:08.798 --> 01:47:13.468
war deaths, suicides.

01:47:13.678 --> 01:47:15.638
They have a shorter
life expectancy.

01:47:18.224 --> 01:47:19.504
Warren Farrell
makes the argument

01:47:19.684 --> 01:47:21.274
that prostate cancer
and breast cancer

01:47:21.436 --> 01:47:24.266
mortality rates are similar,

01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:26.480
but funding
disproportionately supports

01:47:26.691 --> 01:47:28.901
breast cancer research
and awareness

01:47:29.110 --> 01:47:30.650
over prostate cancer.

01:47:34.282 --> 01:47:38.702
The red pill is about
looking at these issues

01:47:38.912 --> 01:47:41.662
in an honest way,
even when it's uncomfortable.

01:47:41.873 --> 01:47:44.043
And these things
are uncomfortable.

01:47:44.250 --> 01:47:49.090
But without the willingness

01:47:49.297 --> 01:47:51.507
to set aside the programming

01:47:51.716 --> 01:47:54.506
<i>and to set aside the false
beliefs about what power 1s</i>

01:47:54.719 --> 01:47:57.599
and what women are
and who women are...

01:47:57.805 --> 01:48:02.555
Part of what we do is a pretty
serious critique of both sexes.

01:48:02.769 --> 01:48:04.019
It's brutal.

01:48:04.228 --> 01:48:06.018
But critiquing the sexes

01:48:06.230 --> 01:48:08.320
is a real valuable thing.

01:48:08.524 --> 01:48:11.154
Feminists don't want you
to do it, though,

01:48:11.361 --> 01:48:13.081
unless you're portraying
women as the victim

01:48:13.154 --> 01:48:15.244
and men as perpetrator.

01:48:15.448 --> 01:48:17.528
The red pill is
about understanding

01:48:17.742 --> 01:48:19.742
men and women like
everything else in life.

01:48:19.953 --> 01:48:21.293
It's a mixed bag.

01:48:21.454 --> 01:48:23.004
You've got victims
and perpetrators

01:48:23.164 --> 01:48:24.504
on both sides of the fence.

01:48:24.707 --> 01:48:26.957
And that's all.
It's real simple.

01:48:27.168 --> 01:48:28.378
It's just not easy.

01:48:32.507 --> 01:48:35.387
Hmm.

01:48:35.593 --> 01:48:38.683
I... I think I agree
with everything you said.

01:48:38.888 --> 01:48:42.978
But there's... there's still
some kind of unsettling doubt,

01:48:43.184 --> 01:48:46.774
and I don't know
where that's coming from.

01:48:46.980 --> 01:48:49.150
I'm recognizing all of these

01:48:49.357 --> 01:48:52.027
very serious
men's rights issues.

01:48:52.235 --> 01:48:54.945
But what I don't understand

01:48:55.154 --> 01:48:57.574
is how I could be agreeing

01:48:57.782 --> 01:49:01.202
with men's rights actmsts.

01:49:01.411 --> 01:49:03.661
Is this the same
misogynist hate group

01:49:03.871 --> 01:49:07.751
I originally discovered online?

01:49:07.959 --> 01:49:09.209
<i>The Southern poverty law center</i>

01:49:09.419 --> 01:49:10.799
has classified that group

01:49:11.004 --> 01:49:13.304
and men's rights groups
as hate groups.

01:49:13.506 --> 01:49:16.376
<i>1 looked into what 1
was hearing from feminists</i>

01:49:16.551 --> 01:49:19.931
and the mass media about
the men's rights movement.

01:49:20.138 --> 01:49:21.598
I've read a lot
and I've heard a lot

01:49:21.806 --> 01:49:23.596
that the men's rights movement

01:49:23.808 --> 01:49:25.388
has been labeled a hate group

01:49:25.601 --> 01:49:27.601
by the Southern poverty
law center.

01:49:27.812 --> 01:49:29.812
- Is that correct?
- Yeah, that's not quite true.

01:49:30.023 --> 01:49:31.823
No, they got it wrong. No.

01:49:32.025 --> 01:49:33.855
This was somehow written up

01:49:34.068 --> 01:49:36.448
on some kind of
anti-men's rights websites

01:49:36.612 --> 01:49:39.032
as us having listed them
as hate groups and so on.

01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:40.240
That we didn't do.

01:49:47.749 --> 01:49:52.049
He wrote a piece

01:49:52.253 --> 01:49:55.053
declaring the month
of October to be

01:49:55.256 --> 01:49:57.836
"bash a violent bitch month."

01:49:58.051 --> 01:49:59.841
Jesus.

01:50:00.053 --> 01:50:02.313
"I mean, literally
to grab them by the hair

01:50:02.513 --> 01:50:05.183
"and smack their face
against the wall," he wrote.

01:50:09.020 --> 01:50:11.270
I then discovered
that Paul elam's famous

01:50:11.481 --> 01:50:14.611
"bash a violent bitch" article
was written in response

01:50:14.817 --> 01:50:17.027
to this article
by jezebel called...

01:50:21.908 --> 01:50:24.078
The article cited
a study that revealed

01:50:24.285 --> 01:50:27.035
70°/o of non-reciprocated
violence

01:50:27.246 --> 01:50:29.166
was perpetuated by women.

01:50:29.373 --> 01:50:31.083
The author then went on to say

01:50:31.292 --> 01:50:34.092
that she conducted an
informal survey at the office

01:50:34.295 --> 01:50:35.875
and the gist of her findings

01:50:36.089 --> 01:50:39.759
was that many women had
physically assaulted their man,

01:50:39.967 --> 01:50:43.297
and it was interpreted
as either being funny

01:50:43.513 --> 01:50:46.813
or he was asking for it.

01:50:47.016 --> 01:50:48.676
I couldn't help
but see the hypocrisy

01:50:48.893 --> 01:50:52.903
in a major feminist website
making light of abusing men,

01:50:53.106 --> 01:50:55.476
and mras stinging back

01:50:55.691 --> 01:50:58.571
only to have the media
paint them as the abusers.

01:52:16.731 --> 01:52:20.781
<i>After my year of filming men's
rights actmsts and feminists</i>

01:52:20.985 --> 01:52:22.565
my descent into the rabbit hole

01:52:22.778 --> 01:52:25.988
was not slowing down.

01:52:26.199 --> 01:52:27.489
My education on gender politics

01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:30.950
was really just beginning.

01:52:31.162 --> 01:52:33.922
I learned about other sectors
of the online manosphere,

01:52:34.123 --> 01:52:37.003
like mgtow,
"men going their own way,"

01:52:37.210 --> 01:52:40.590
and forum on reddit
called "the red pill,"

01:52:40.796 --> 01:52:42.399
which is separate from
the men's rights community,

01:52:42.423 --> 01:52:46.223
and they do not see eye to eye.

01:52:46.427 --> 01:52:48.427
I'm told an easy way
to remember the difference

01:52:48.638 --> 01:52:52.808
is that while mras want
to change the system

01:52:53.017 --> 01:52:56.647
<i>redd1t's “the red pill“ want to
take adv ant age of the system,</i>

01:52:56.812 --> 01:52:58.982
and mgtow want
to leave the system.

01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:03.900
There are so many
perspectives on gender,

01:53:04.111 --> 01:53:07.111
and I believe they're
all worthy of listening to.

01:53:07.323 --> 01:53:11.453
However, the conversation
is being silenced.

01:53:11.661 --> 01:53:14.001
For a society to accept
anything said

01:53:14.205 --> 01:53:15.995
on behalf of women's rights

01:53:16.207 --> 01:53:19.457
and then to shame any
dialogue about men's rights

01:53:19.669 --> 01:53:23.259
and call it hate speech
is precisely the problem.

01:53:23.464 --> 01:53:25.474
<i>This 1s what men's
rights look like'.!</i>

01:53:25.675 --> 01:53:27.255
I don't know where I'm headed,

01:53:27.468 --> 01:53:30.638
but I know what I left behind.

01:53:30.846 --> 01:53:33.056
I no longer call myself
a feminist.
