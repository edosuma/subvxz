00:13.120 --> 00:16.760
Kids, the thing about New Year's Eve is that it sucks.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.360
Sure, it looks great on TV,

00:18.360 --> 00:20.760
but in reality, it's always just a big let down,

00:20.760 --> 00:23.840
but in 2005, I attempted to do the impossible,

00:23.840 --> 00:25.720
to give my friends a great New Year's Eve.

00:25.720 --> 00:27.400
I had an idea of how to do it, too.

00:27.400 --> 00:30.040
And all it cost was half my Christmas bonus.

00:37.960 --> 00:41.760
Yeah, that's right-- a limo.

00:47.720 --> 00:49.680
Oh, man, Ted, this is great.

00:49.680 --> 00:51.640
Okay, people, let's talk strategy.

00:51.640 --> 00:54.720
Last new years, we went our separate ways, and it sucked.

00:54.720 --> 00:57.400
This year we party together or not at all.

00:57.400 --> 00:59.360
Now, I sifted through your party submissions

00:59.360 --> 01:01.200
and I narrowed them down to these five.

01:01.200 --> 01:01.800
Question?

01:01.800 --> 01:04.239
Yes, Barney, your submissions were received and no,

01:04.239 --> 01:06.600
we will not be attending any parties in your pants.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.200
But you enjoyed the e-vite, right?

01:09.360 --> 01:11.320
Thas an actual picture of my pants.

01:11.320 --> 01:11.960
Yeah.

01:11.960 --> 01:14.160
We will hit all five parties before midnight,

01:14.160 --> 01:15.720
and then narrow them down to one,

01:15.720 --> 01:17.960
the most awesome party in New York City

01:17.960 --> 01:22.280
and that is where we will ring,
nay rock, in the new year.

01:22.520 --> 01:25.480
All right, and party number one that's where we get to meet Mary Beth?

01:25.680 --> 01:26.480
Mary Beth?

01:26.480 --> 01:28.080
Oh, she works in my office.

01:28.240 --> 01:29.880
She seems like she might be into me.

01:29.880 --> 01:31.880
She's always finding reasons to hug me.

01:31.960 --> 01:33.960
So tonight...

01:35.600 --> 01:39.640
People often ask me "Barney, how is it that you're so psyched so much of the time?"

01:39.640 --> 01:41.840
By who ?
Who asks you that?

01:43.000 --> 01:45.480
And the answer is right here--

01:45.480 --> 01:48.440
my own, personal "get psyched" mix.

01:48.440 --> 01:50.640
Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall,

01:50.640 --> 01:52.400
but people are wrong.

01:52.400 --> 01:55.240
It should be all rise, baby.

01:55.240 --> 01:58.160
Now prepare yourselves for an audio journey

01:58.160 --> 02:01.760
into the white-hot center of adrenaline.

02:02.280 --> 02:03.360
Bam.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.840
It's working.

02:07.840 --> 02:10.039
- I am definitely getting psyched.
- Oh, God.

02:10.039 --> 02:12.800
I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.120
Must do robot.

02:15.520 --> 02:17.920
- Let's do this!
- Yes! Let's!

02:17.920 --> 02:19.840
Oh, driver?

02:23.280 --> 02:25.520
Ranjit! Dude, you're driving a limo now.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.520
That's awesome.

02:26.520 --> 02:28.440
I've moved up in the world.

02:29.120 --> 02:30.760
How do you guys know each other?

02:30.760 --> 02:33.680
Oh, we rode in his cab one time.
It's a long story.

02:34.120 --> 02:35.200
Hey, what are we waiting for?

02:35.200 --> 02:37.080
We got five parties to hit, and three hours to do it.

02:37.080 --> 02:39.080
Oh, I wish I could come with you guys but Derek

02:39.080 --> 02:41.320
should be coming by any minute to pick me up.

02:41.320 --> 02:45.560
Oh, yeah, Robin was spending New Year's with her boyfriend, Derek.

02:45.800 --> 02:46.480
Derek.

02:46.480 --> 02:49.000
He was like rich, successful, handsome.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.480
I hated that guy.

02:51.520 --> 02:53.320
Oh, I'll miss you guys. Have fun.

02:53.320 --> 02:53.960
Bye.

02:53.960 --> 02:55.120
See ya next year.

02:55.120 --> 02:56.280
Go get 'em.

02:58.480 --> 02:59.880
Well, this kind of sucks.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.840
Okay, nobody get down.
We knew this going in.

03:02.840 --> 03:04.120
We're a man down.

03:04.120 --> 03:06.720
That just means we're gonna have to party that much harder.

03:06.720 --> 03:07.840
Ranjit!

03:08.240 --> 03:12.160
- Party number one.
- Party number one!

03:16.440 --> 03:19.520
I can't believe we're leaving a party that had pigs in blankets.

03:19.520 --> 03:22.040
If you think we can beat that, you got some brass ones.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.040
Hey, we've got four more parties to hit.

03:24.040 --> 03:27.000
If party number one turns out to be the best, we'll just limo on back to it.

03:27.320 --> 03:28.720
We didn't really get a chance to meet.

03:28.720 --> 03:30.840
I'm Lily, and this is my fiance, Marshall.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.320
Hi. Mary Beth.

03:32.320 --> 03:34.320
So great to meet you guys.

03:34.760 --> 03:37.400
- My word.
- You're, you're friendly.

03:41.040 --> 03:44.280
American party friends of Barney's.

03:45.160 --> 03:46.080
Oh, no.

03:46.080 --> 03:47.920
So, Barney, who's your new friend?

03:47.920 --> 03:49.600
Natalya.

03:50.240 --> 03:52.080
Oh, friendly.

03:52.880 --> 03:55.760
- So, where are you from, Natalya?
- She... Who knows?

03:55.760 --> 03:58.680
The former Soviet Republic of Drunk-Off-Her-Ass-Istan?

03:59.920 --> 04:02.680
Super-drunk-fantastic, huh?

04:03.600 --> 04:05.000
Isn't she awesome?

04:06.000 --> 04:09.120
- How are your feet doing, baby?
- Okay, I love these shoes,

04:09.120 --> 04:11.720
but the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep.

04:11.720 --> 04:13.960
Can we swing by the apartment, so I can change?

04:13.960 --> 04:17.279
Come on, Lily, we have a tightly scheduled evening of awesomeness ahead of us.

04:17.279 --> 04:18.839
I need you to power through the pain.

04:18.839 --> 04:22.240
Okay, Ted, but these dogs are really barking.

04:22.440 --> 04:23.680
It's true.
I can hear them.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.160
What's that, little boys?
What's that?

04:25.160 --> 04:27.360
You wanna go for a... rock?

04:29.920 --> 04:34.200
- Ranjit! Party number two.
- Party number two.

04:40.320 --> 04:42.080
- Party number two?
- Not so good.

04:42.320 --> 04:43.800
Let's go back to party number one.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.200
No, no turning back.

04:45.600 --> 04:49.960
- Ranjit, party number three.
- Party number three. Yeah.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.200
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
We have to turn around.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.320
We left Natalya.

04:54.320 --> 04:57.000
Barney, none of us really liked her.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.680
- What?!
- Sorry.

04:59.360 --> 05:03.160
Oh, very nice, Lily.
You know, she is a guest in this country.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.720
So while you may chose to turn your back on her,

05:06.120 --> 05:09.520
I choose to turn my front on her. What up?

05:10.600 --> 05:12.120
I'm sorry about Barney.

05:12.760 --> 05:14.560
No, I'm having a great time.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.760
I'm really glad that you asked me out tonight.

05:17.160 --> 05:18.240
Me, too.

05:22.520 --> 05:26.080
- Hey, Robin.
- Ted, Derek stood me up.

05:26.280 --> 05:27.760
Pfft. Derek.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.560
Now, we had a tight schedule to keep that night

05:29.560 --> 05:31.880
and I was already on a date with another girl.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.960
But... it was Robin.

05:34.360 --> 05:36.760
Ranjit, turn it around.

05:44.080 --> 05:46.360
Oh, God, I'm so sorry about this.

05:46.360 --> 05:49.160
You guys had your schedule and I screwed it all up.

05:49.160 --> 05:50.480
No, this is perfect.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.680
It's meant to be.
We're all back together.

05:53.080 --> 05:53.800
What happened?

05:53.800 --> 05:56.320
Derek's stuck in Connecticut closing some deal.

05:56.320 --> 05:58.600
Who works on New Year's Eve?

05:59.640 --> 06:01.960
Okay.
Now I feel worse.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.880
I was really looking forward to this night.

06:05.200 --> 06:06.280
This sucks.

06:10.360 --> 06:11.520
Oh, dude, not now!

06:11.520 --> 06:13.760
What? She needs to get psyched.

06:13.760 --> 06:14.840
Fine.

06:15.240 --> 06:17.200
Maybe I should just go home.

06:19.760 --> 06:21.720
My finger slipped.

06:22.240 --> 06:25.760
Look, Robin, you're not going home.
Come on, it's New Year's Eve.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.480
Look, so your date fell through.
So what ?

06:27.480 --> 06:29.400
What do you need a date for?
Someone to kiss at midnight?

06:29.480 --> 06:32.760
Fine. I'll kiss you at...
a little bit after midnight.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.240
- Hi, I'm Robin.
- Mary Beth.

06:37.280 --> 06:38.560
You're friendly.

06:38.840 --> 06:40.560
I haven't eaten dinner yet.

06:40.560 --> 06:41.840
Is there anything to eat in this thing?

06:41.840 --> 06:43.320
That's it. I know what you're jonesing for.

06:43.320 --> 06:46.000
Ranjit, take us to Gray's Papaya!

06:46.000 --> 06:48.240
Oh, yes.
Ted, you rock.

06:48.560 --> 06:51.360
We couldn't go back for Natalya, a human being,

06:51.360 --> 06:52.840
but we do have time for hot dogs?

06:52.840 --> 06:54.320
Yeah, we like hot dogs.

06:54.320 --> 06:57.320
No. No. We are already behind schedule.

06:57.320 --> 06:57.920
Ted, come on.

06:57.920 --> 07:01.360
We have an hour and a half before midnight I don't want to be kissing Ranjit.

07:01.360 --> 07:04.000
You don't know what you're missing.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.800
Come on, it's only a 20-minute detour.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.840
Which is exactly how much time I need.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.880
- Ranjit, stop the car.
- Stopping the car.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.040
Wait. Baby, what are you doing?

07:13.040 --> 07:14.920
- I'm going home.
- What? No!

07:15.360 --> 07:18.080
I can't stay in these heels any longer, I just can't.

07:18.080 --> 07:19.440
There's a cab over there.

07:19.440 --> 07:21.720
I'll just run back to the apartment and change shoes.

07:21.720 --> 07:22.720
But... hot dogs.

07:22.720 --> 07:26.200
Well, I know, baby, I'd love to go, but it's two against one.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.600
- Okay, I'll go with you.
- No, baby.

07:28.600 --> 07:31.720
Baby, you go with them and I'll meet you at, at...

07:31.720 --> 07:34.120
- party number three.
- Are you sure?

07:34.520 --> 07:37.240
- If I don't see you, happy new year.
- Don't say that.

07:37.600 --> 07:39.160
We'll find each other.

07:40.840 --> 07:42.160
We'll find each other.

07:42.680 --> 07:44.000
I know we will.

07:49.160 --> 07:50.440
Hell of a woman.

07:51.800 --> 07:54.840
Let's go get some hot dogs!

07:59.600 --> 08:01.640
Ranjit, party number three.

08:01.640 --> 08:04.480
- Party number three.
- Oh, yeah!

08:04.480 --> 08:06.800
Look at us.
Riding around in a limo.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.120
Eating hot dogs.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.880
It's like we're the president.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.880
Hey. I'll bet you're feeling better now.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.840
Oh, so much better.

08:13.840 --> 08:14.880
Guys.

08:14.880 --> 08:16.520
Is that Moby?

08:17.240 --> 08:19.080
I think that that's Moby.

08:19.440 --> 08:23.080
Now, kids, Moby was a popular recording artist when I was young.

08:23.680 --> 08:24.760
No way.

08:24.760 --> 08:27.400
That's totally Moby.
That's awesome.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.880
Should I say something?
I should say something, right?

08:29.880 --> 08:32.400
Moby! Hey, Moby!

08:32.840 --> 08:33.840
Oh, my God.
He's coming over.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.760
Everybody be cool.
Everybody be cool.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.400
- Hey.
- Hello.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.960
What's up?
Uh, you, uh, going somewhere?

08:41.080 --> 08:44.120
Yeah, I'm just going to this party downtown.

08:44.480 --> 08:45.840
You want a ride?

08:47.800 --> 08:48.920
Sure.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.360
Welcome.

08:56.600 --> 08:59.720
- Wow. You're friendly.
- Big fan.

09:00.120 --> 09:01.480
Barney Stinson.

09:01.920 --> 09:04.560
So, uh... what about this party?

09:04.560 --> 09:06.480
It's just a New Year's thing.

09:06.480 --> 09:07.600
You know, with some friends.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.440
Wow, that sounds awesome.

09:12.480 --> 09:13.840
You guys want to come?

09:13.880 --> 09:16.160
Yeah, we'd love to.

09:16.160 --> 09:17.760
- All right.
- Uh, Ted.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.360
S idebar?

09:20.240 --> 09:23.640
Um... Moby, switch up, will you?

09:26.600 --> 09:27.920
Yeah, what's up?

09:29.280 --> 09:30.800
- What about Lily?
- Call her.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.600
I've been trying to call her.
I can't get through.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.960
- All the circuits are jammed.
- That's New Year's Eve for you.

09:34.960 --> 09:37.360
Well, look, we'll just swing by Moby's party and then afterwards...

09:37.360 --> 09:40.040
No, I-I can't.
Lily's waiting. I gotta...

09:40.040 --> 09:41.520
I gotta find her.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.880
Okay, I'll meet you at party number three.

09:43.880 --> 09:46.280
But... Come on!
Moby's party!

09:46.280 --> 09:49.760
Moby's party!
Moby's par...

09:51.160 --> 09:52.560
Ranjit.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.640
- Moby's party.
- Moby's party.

09:58.720 --> 10:00.280
This is a cool mix.

10:00.680 --> 10:03.680
You know, people think a great mix has to rise and fall.

10:03.680 --> 10:05.400
I think it should be all rise.

10:05.400 --> 10:09.560
Yes. Moby... Yeah, it should start high, get higher.

10:09.560 --> 10:11.240
This mix is my pride and joy.

10:11.240 --> 10:12.880
I never leave home without it.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.040
Oh, that's how I feel about Janice here.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.720
Jan... Aah!

10:19.920 --> 10:21.280
So then I say,

10:21.280 --> 10:23.760
"your motorcycle was like that when I got here."

10:30.040 --> 10:32.240
You're not Moby, are you?

10:32.320 --> 10:33.240
Who?

10:33.720 --> 10:37.240
Moby-- the recording artist, Moby.

10:37.240 --> 10:38.400
No.

10:38.760 --> 10:42.480
But when we said, "Hey, Moby," you said, "Yeah."

10:42.760 --> 10:44.360
I thought you said "Tony."

10:45.240 --> 10:46.960
So your name is Tony?

10:46.960 --> 10:47.920
No.

10:49.320 --> 10:51.000
Oh, hey, we're here.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.160
All right.

10:52.640 --> 10:53.960
You guys going to come in?

10:54.680 --> 10:55.800
Nah.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.040
You're sure?

10:57.120 --> 10:59.360
Come on. It's going to get nuts in there.

10:59.640 --> 11:01.160
There's this dude who owes me money.

11:01.680 --> 11:04.320
No, uh, we're good.
We're good.

11:04.320 --> 11:06.560
Happy New Year, Not Moby.

11:10.360 --> 11:14.360
Oh, hey, hey, um, be safe.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.240
Why did we think that guy was Moby?

11:19.240 --> 11:20.080
I don't know.

11:20.080 --> 11:23.360
I see a short bald hipster, my mind goes straight to Moby.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.080
That's Marshall's phone.

11:32.760 --> 11:33.560
Hello.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.280
Oh, Marshall, thank God I got through.

11:36.280 --> 11:40.200
- Hey, sexy.
- Barney, where's Marshall?

11:40.640 --> 11:41.640
He left his phone in the limo.

11:41.640 --> 11:43.720
- He's out looking for you.
- What? Where?

11:43.720 --> 11:45.240
Party number three.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.880
Well, I'm here at party number three and...

11:48.240 --> 11:51.320
Oh, my God! Guess who just walked in-- Moby!

11:51.320 --> 11:53.200
Moby?! She's upstairs.

11:54.280 --> 11:57.360
Lily, you have to get out of there this instant. That's not Moby.

11:57.720 --> 12:00.640
Uh, no, I know Moby and that's Mo...

12:00.640 --> 12:03.080
- Does he have a gun?
- Run!

12:04.560 --> 12:08.160
Oh, my God, Not Moby's party is party number four.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.320
What are the odds?

12:11.880 --> 12:13.240
Who was that guy?!

12:13.240 --> 12:15.320
Well, we know it's not Moby and it's not Tony.

12:15.320 --> 12:16.480
Ranjit, drive!

12:16.480 --> 12:18.600
- Where to?
- Party number three!

12:18.680 --> 12:20.800
Party number three!

12:22.000 --> 12:24.280
No, but I was just at party number three.

12:24.280 --> 12:26.040
No, no, no, no you were at party number four.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.440
You must have looked at the list wrong.

12:27.440 --> 12:30.520
Well, after that rather unpsyching experience,

12:30.520 --> 12:32.240
you know what it's time for?

12:32.240 --> 12:36.640
It's time to... what?
That's right, re-psych.

12:38.320 --> 12:40.240
Re-psy...

12:41.480 --> 12:42.280
Where's the...?

12:46.160 --> 12:47.240
Oh, my God!

12:47.240 --> 12:49.840
Not Moby took my "Get Psyched" mix!

12:49.960 --> 12:52.560
Barney, Barney, Barney, it's not worth it!

12:52.560 --> 12:53.800
Let it go.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.640
We need to get back on schedule.

12:57.440 --> 12:58.920
Ah, nuts.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.560
Ranjit, are you sure I can't help?

13:07.680 --> 13:08.640
No.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.160
I am pissed.

13:10.160 --> 13:12.640
Ted, I don't want you to see me pissed.

13:13.080 --> 13:14.160
Okay.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.440
Okay, not a problem.

13:17.440 --> 13:21.240
He'll jack it up, slap on a tire and we'll be at party number three in no time.

13:21.720 --> 13:23.560
I wish Marshall would call.

13:23.560 --> 13:25.040
I guess the circuits are jammed.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.560
Yeah, you know why all the circuits are jammed

13:26.560 --> 13:28.120
because everyone's calling their loved ones,

13:28.120 --> 13:29.480
everyone around the world.

13:29.480 --> 13:31.280
Everyone except Barney.

13:33.640 --> 13:35.280
Oh, sure, laugh.

13:35.280 --> 13:37.440
Laugh for Barney Stinson.

13:37.440 --> 13:41.920
Laugh for the sad clown trapped on his whirling carousel

13:41.920 --> 13:45.080
of suits and cigars and bimbos and booze.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.520
Round and round it goes.

13:47.520 --> 13:49.240
And where's it all heading?

13:49.240 --> 13:50.920
Nowhere.

13:51.480 --> 13:54.840
Is this just 'cause you lost your "Get Psyched" mix?

13:54.840 --> 13:57.440
I'm sorry. Am I not allowed to have a pensive side?

13:57.440 --> 14:01.000
No. No, not tonight.
Not in the limo.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.040
We got to stay psyched.

14:02.040 --> 14:06.920
Ted went to a lot of trouble to make this an awesome New Year's.

14:08.840 --> 14:13.200
"Shot through the heart
And you're to blame, darling"

14:13.200 --> 14:17.480
"You give love a bad name
A bad name"

14:17.880 --> 14:21.600
- "I play my part and you played your game"
- I'm going to get some air.

14:21.680 --> 14:25.680
"Darling, you give love a bad name, bad name!"

14:31.000 --> 14:32.200
It'll be fine.

14:32.200 --> 14:33.680
We'll be out of here in a jiff.

14:33.680 --> 14:34.960
Ted, I'm going to head out.

14:34.960 --> 14:37.520
My roommates are having a party not far from here.

14:37.520 --> 14:40.560
No. Look, I know this night isn't turning out the way I planned, but...

14:40.560 --> 14:42.960
How long have you been in love with Robin?

14:43.800 --> 14:45.120
I'm not in love...

14:45.520 --> 14:48.080
We're just friends.
Where are you getting that from?

14:48.480 --> 14:51.040
Ted, it's okay.
I'm fine.

14:51.040 --> 14:53.960
And I can tell that she's into you, too.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.400
That's ridiculous.

14:55.840 --> 14:56.960
Wait. Really?

14:58.280 --> 15:00.080
Happy New Year, Ted.

15:16.520 --> 15:19.080
I can't believe Mary Beth left before midnight.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.640
Oh, she just had to make an appearance at this other party.

15:21.640 --> 15:22.680
It's no big deal.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.640
The first time I rode in a limo I was five.

15:25.640 --> 15:28.120
I was on the way to my grandfather's funeral.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.920
I suppose, in a way, I still am.

15:32.440 --> 15:34.000
Okay, wow, it's getting weird in here.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.240
- I'm going to call Marshall.
- But he left his phone.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.240
I'm sorry about your girl.

15:43.240 --> 15:45.160
Sorry about your guy.

15:45.720 --> 15:48.400
Well, at least we both have someone to kiss at midnight.

15:49.680 --> 15:53.280
Did you forget about our little deal?
Because I did not.

15:54.600 --> 15:56.600
I did not, too.

15:59.720 --> 16:00.680
D erek.

16:01.480 --> 16:05.040
- Hi. How's work?
- I'll give you some privacy.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.400
Okay, how's this for a plan?

16:22.400 --> 16:24.800
We start walking now, we get to party number three by 12:45.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.840
We celebrate the New Year in Central Standard Time.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.840
- Give it a rest, Ted.
- Give what a rest?

16:29.840 --> 16:32.400
Trying to turn this night into anything more than what it is,

16:32.400 --> 16:34.320
which is New Year's Eve which is the single

16:34.320 --> 16:36.880
biggest letdown of a night every single year.

16:39.160 --> 16:41.120
Come on, come on, we can still turn this thing around.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.200
We've still got ten minutes.

16:42.200 --> 16:45.840
Stop trying to chase down some magical, perfect New Years, Ted.

16:45.840 --> 16:47.600
It doesn't exist.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.560
Holy crap.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.720
I knew I'd catch up with you guys eventually.

17:06.720 --> 17:08.240
So much to tell.

17:08.240 --> 17:10.440
I couldn't find Lily at party number three so I walked--

17:10.440 --> 17:12.200
I walked to the next party on the list.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.119
- Not Moby's party?
- Yes, Moby's party.

17:14.119 --> 17:15.760
Check it out.
He signed my shirt.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.520
And guess what I found.

17:21.960 --> 17:24.680
Yeah, I heard it playing at the party, so I swiped it.

17:24.680 --> 17:26.480
Yeah, I know.
Come on.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.280
Come on! Oh! Oh!

17:30.320 --> 17:33.240
Baby, baby, I was so worried about you.

17:33.240 --> 17:34.840
- Why didn't you call me?
- I tried, baby.

17:34.840 --> 17:37.120
All the circuits were jammed.
But wait, there's more.

17:37.120 --> 17:40.160
After party number four, I figured you guys went to party number five.

17:40.160 --> 17:43.200
And so I went there, too, and it is awesome.

17:43.200 --> 17:46.480
I want to cry, it is so awesome.
We have to go there.

17:46.480 --> 17:47.680
How? We'll never get a cab.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.840
The flat's fixed.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.920
Let's do this!
Come on! In!

17:53.040 --> 17:54.080
Go, go, go!

17:54.320 --> 17:55.600
- Go, go, go!
- Natalya?

17:55.720 --> 17:58.080
Yeah, it turns out she was asleep in the front seat the whole time.

17:58.080 --> 17:59.440
Ranjit, why didn't you tell me?

17:59.440 --> 18:02.520
I didn't want to awake her.
She looked so peaceful.

18:02.520 --> 18:05.160
Party number five is 20 blocks away and all the way across town.

18:05.160 --> 18:06.920
Ranjit, can you get us there in eight minutes?

18:06.920 --> 18:08.600
I get you there in six.

18:13.480 --> 18:15.080
I don't think I can do it.

18:15.080 --> 18:18.000
No! Come on!
Move, you stupid taxi!

18:18.000 --> 18:20.200
Three minutes!
Come on!

18:22.640 --> 18:24.600
Ranjit, put her in park.

18:26.040 --> 18:29.080
Dudes, I'm sure party number five is awesome,

18:29.080 --> 18:31.160
but it's not the best party in New York.

18:31.920 --> 18:34.160
'Cause this is, right here.

18:35.240 --> 18:38.000
- Cheers. Well said.
- Cheers. Cheers.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.280
And just like that, we were having the perfect New Year's Eve.

18:42.280 --> 18:46.120
The funny thing is all night long, I'd been trying to chase something down

18:46.640 --> 18:48.480
that was right there in that limo.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.480
Derek?!
Derek.

18:56.280 --> 18:58.640
- Hey.
- Hey, uh, come on in.

19:03.120 --> 19:06.760
I cut my meeting short because I wanted to see you at midnight.

19:06.760 --> 19:08.640
I can't believe you made it.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.520
I made it, baby.

19:12.920 --> 19:16.080
I super love you, okay?

19:16.280 --> 19:18.000
Here, you need a mint.

19:18.920 --> 19:27.040
Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Happy New Year!

19:27.160 --> 19:30.680
You probably want to feel bad for your old man at this point in the story.

19:30.800 --> 19:31.720
Well, don't.

19:32.080 --> 19:34.000
Not every night has a happy ending.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.680
But all of it's important.

19:35.680 --> 19:37.240
All of it was leading somewhere.

19:37.560 --> 19:40.360
Because suddenly, it was 2006.

19:40.800 --> 19:43.880
And 2006 was a big one.

19:48.040 --> 19:50.280
What the hell, man?
I thought we had a deal.

19:53.120 --> 19:54.640
What about your guy?

19:54.960 --> 19:56.880
It's midnight.
Go kiss him.

19:56.880 --> 20:00.960
Eh, he kept me waiting.
I can keep him waiting.

20:02.640 --> 20:05.000
Well, a deal is a deal.

20:16.480 --> 20:17.720
Happy New Year.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.400
Happy New Year.
