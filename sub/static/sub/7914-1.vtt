when he refused to share
his week's receipts with them.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.666
Stacks of newspapers
were tossed in the gutter,

The challenge delights me

53:53.480 --> 53:56.065
The more you resist, babe

53:56.567 --> 53:58.276
The more it excites me

53:58.360 --> 54:00.445
Dick Tracy has struck tonight,
and he has struck hard,

54:00.529 --> 54:01.946
right at the heart
of the gang lord's empire.

54:02.031 --> 54:08.995

it's Tracy, Tracy, Tracy!

It's like he's reading my mind.

55:45.009 --> 55:46.801
Texie Garcia,

55:46.885 --> 55:50.096
Ribs Mocca, Johnny Ramm
and now DeSanto. I don't get it.

55:50.305 --> 55:52.432
How could he catch them so fast?

55:52.516 --> 55:54.475
I don't understand.
He knows what we're doing,

55:54.560 --> 55:55.852
before we do it.

55:55.936 --> 55:57.520
You said you had a way
of taking care of Tracy,

55:57.771 --> 56:01.858
"Leave it to me," you said.
Well, let me tell you somethin'.

56:01.942 --> 56:05.945
I'm taking this bum out of the headlines.
I'm rubbin' him out!

56:06.655 --> 56:11.117
You kill Tracy, they point
the finger at me. This bum...

Hey, Mike, what'd you put in
this chili, melted rubber?

56:56.955 --> 57:01.501
Sometimes I wonder why I slave over
a hot stove for you, Tracy.

57:02.169 --> 57:07.215
Okay, Freddy. Get down
to the Southside Warehouse.

57:07.299 --> 57:08.299
Big payoff!

57:22.689 --> 57:25.024
Tracy, I'm leaving.

57:28.153 --> 57:32.698
I used to be afraid that maybe you'd
never take some time and settle down,

57:32.783 --> 57:35.201
and now I know it.

57:36.995 --> 57:39.247
I knew you'd never
want a desk job, Tracy.

You bums forgot how to kill people?

01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:15.152
Doesn't your work mean
anything to you anymore?

01:00:15.237 --> 01:00:18.239
Have you no sense
of pride in what you do?

01:00:18.323 --> 01:00:21.701
No sense of duty? No sense of destiny?

01:00:21.785 --> 01:00:23.703

I want Dick Tracy dead!

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:34.297
Don't get me wrong, Tracy.
If you say there was a man with no face,

01:00:34.381 --> 01:00:36.465
I'll bet the mortgage there was.

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:38.634
-But who's he working for?
-Yeah, who's he workin' for?

01:00:38.719 --> 01:00:40.094
I don't know, boys,
but I didn't dream him up.

01:00:40.178 --> 01:00:43.806
Would you get my suit cleaned?
We need a witness who'll testify.

What can you lose?

01:00:49.938 --> 01:00:53.357
I don't know, Big Boy. It seems they
want to get rid of Tracy as much as you.

01:00:53.442 --> 01:00:55.693
It'll only cost you 1 0%.
What can you lose?

01:00:55.777 --> 01:00:58.362
Okay, piano player.

01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:11.792
-Where's Tess?
-Out of town.

01:01:11.877 --> 01:01:14.295
She asked me and the boys
to take care of the Kid

01:01:14.379 --> 01:01:15.838
till they take him to the orphanage.

01:01:15.922 --> 01:01:18.674
-MIKE: There's no jelly in that donut.
-Tess went out of town, huh?

01:01:18.759 --> 01:01:20.843
Sorry, Tracy, I thought you knew.

01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:24.305
Want me to take the Kid
back to the precinct?

I don't know about yourjob.
I only know what I feel.

01:03:59.586 --> 01:04:02.087
If you can't tell me how you feel,
Tracy, then I can't trust you.

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:05.633
Wait a minute.
What do you want me to admit?

01:04:05.717 --> 01:04:09.887

He's torn, Tess.
He's torn between love and duty.

If you get too close to a man like that,

01:05:23.878 --> 01:05:25.629
you probably won't be
treated much better

than he treats himself.

01:05:27.507 --> 01:05:30.843

to love a man like that.

What did you say, Mother?

to love a man like that.

01:37:09.407 --> 01:37:12.117
-He was her piano player.
-Not bad.

01:37:12.202 --> 01:37:13.869
Right. Mmm-hmm.

01:37:14.537 --> 01:37:16.497
You know, you're probably much
too smart to need this,

01:37:16.581 --> 01:37:19.249
but I think I'm gonna
give it to you anyway.

01:37:22.045 --> 01:37:24.588
Gee!

01:37:24.672 --> 01:37:26.924
Tracy! This...

01:37:27.008 --> 01:37:30.594
Thank you. Wow!

01:37:30.678 --> 01:37:33.805
Tastes different, Mike.
What did you do? Wash the bowl?

01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:35.766
Don't listen to him, Mike. It's just grand.

01:37:35.850 --> 01:37:39.436
MIKE: Except for the guy she goes
out with, this lady's got real taste.

01:37:40.271 --> 01:37:42.856
-Tess.
-What?

01:37:42.941 --> 01:37:45.734
-I've been thinking.
-What about?

01:37:45.818 --> 01:37:48.695
Well, you living alone, and...

01:37:48.780 --> 01:37:50.989
I like living alone.

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:53.992
Uh-huh.

01:37:54.702 --> 01:37:56.203
We have that in common, I guess.

01:37:56.663 --> 01:37:57.955
Uh-huh.

01:37:58.957 --> 01:38:00.666
Well, don't we?

01:38:01.918 --> 01:38:04.169
Well, I just think

01:38:04.254 --> 01:38:05.921
when two people have
so much in common,

01:38:06.005 --> 01:38:08.382
they ought to do something about it.

01:38:14.138 --> 01:38:15.556
Would...

01:38:16.057 --> 01:38:17.057
Uh-oh.

01:38:17.141 --> 01:38:19.142
Shut up, Kid.

01:38:19.227 --> 01:38:21.144
And... (CLEARS THROAT)

01:38:32.657 --> 01:38:35.075
Don't...

01:38:35.159 --> 01:38:36.451
Yes?

01:38:41.833 --> 01:38:45.002
Don't you think we'd
be happier if we just...

01:38:45.837 --> 01:38:47.462
What?

01:38:53.303 --> 01:38:54.428
What do you think?

01:38:54.512 --> 01:38:57.097
Dick Tracy, are you asking me to...

01:38:57.181 --> 01:38:58.807
PAT: Calling Dick Tracy.
Pat Patton to Dick Tracy.

01:38:58.891 --> 01:39:01.727
Robbery in progress, Tracy.
Metropolitan Bank.

01:39:01.811 --> 01:39:03.812
Hot diggity dog!

01:39:04.063 --> 01:39:06.523
Come on! Let's go!

01:39:06.983 --> 01:39:09.359
Come on, Tracy! Let's go! Come on!

01:39:09.444 --> 01:39:10.527
Come on, Tracy!

01:39:10.612 --> 01:39:13.905
Well, what are you waitin' for?
A nice, safe desk?

01:39:21.039 --> 01:39:22.956
Tess,

01:39:27.962 --> 01:39:29.546
you're one in a million.

01:39:39.849 --> 01:39:42.643
KID: This is amazing, Tracy!
What are you waitin' for?

01:39:42.727 --> 01:39:44.686
Come on. Let's go!

01:39:45.647 --> 01:39:49.566
Come on. Metropolitan Bank.
Come on. Step on it!

01:39:51.527 --> 01:39:54.696
You know somethin', Tracy?
I kinda like that dame.

01:40:29.607 --> 01:40:31.233
(MORE PLAYING)

01:40:31.776 --> 01:40:35.028
Once upon a time
l had plenty of nothin'

01:40:35.113 --> 01:40:36.321
Which was fine with me

01:40:36.406 --> 01:40:38.824
Because l had rhythm, music, love

01:40:38.908 --> 01:40:41.034
The sun, the stars
and the moon above

01:40:41.119 --> 01:40:46.289
Had the clear blue sky
and the deep blue sea

01:40:46.374 --> 01:40:50.752
That was when the best things
in life were free

01:40:50.837 --> 01:40:54.256
Then time went by
and now l get plenty of plenty

01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:55.340
Which is fine with me

01:40:55.425 --> 01:40:58.135
'Cause I still got love
l still got rhythm

01:40:58.219 --> 01:41:01.930
But look at what
l got to go with 'em

01:41:02.014 --> 01:41:07.561
"Who could ask for anything more?"
l hear you query

01:41:07.645 --> 01:41:12.566
Who could ask for anything more?
Well, let me tell you

01:41:12.650 --> 01:41:15.652
Dearie

01:41:18.740 --> 01:41:20.991
Got my diamonds

01:41:21.075 --> 01:41:23.285
Got my yacht

01:41:23.369 --> 01:41:27.914
Got a guy I adore

01:41:27.999 --> 01:41:32.461
l'm so happy with what l got

01:41:32.545 --> 01:41:37.007
I want more

01:41:37.091 --> 01:41:39.342
Count your blessings

01:41:39.427 --> 01:41:41.678
One, two, three

01:41:41.763 --> 01:41:46.141
l just hate keeping score

01:41:46.225 --> 01:41:50.270
Any number is fine with me

01:41:50.354 --> 01:41:54.149
As long as it's more

01:41:54.233 --> 01:41:57.736
As long as it's more!

01:41:57.820 --> 01:42:02.240
I'm no mathematician

01:42:02.325 --> 01:42:06.953
All I know is addition

01:42:07.038 --> 01:42:10.874
l find counting a bore

01:42:11.042 --> 01:42:13.752
Keep the number mounting
Your accountant does the counting

01:42:13.836 --> 01:42:15.754
More!

01:42:20.718 --> 01:42:22.928
l got rhythm

01:42:23.012 --> 01:42:25.222
Music, too

01:42:25.306 --> 01:42:29.810
Just as much as before

01:42:29.894 --> 01:42:34.314
Got my guy and my sky of blue

01:42:34.398 --> 01:42:39.027
Now, however, I own the view

01:42:39.111 --> 01:42:42.906
More is better than nothing, true

01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:47.786
But nothing's better than
more, more, more

01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:53.083
Nothing's better than more

01:42:54.836 --> 01:42:57.003
One is fun, why not two?

01:42:57.088 --> 01:42:59.172
And if you like two
might as well have four

01:42:59.257 --> 01:43:01.466
And if you like four why not a few

01:43:01.551 --> 01:43:04.845
Why not a slew more?

01:43:04.929 --> 01:43:07.055
lf you've got a little, why not a lot?

01:43:07.139 --> 01:43:09.266
Add a bit and it'll get to be an oodle

01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:11.518
Everyjot and tittle adds to the pot

01:43:11.602 --> 01:43:13.854
Soon you've got the kit
as well as the caboodle

01:43:13.938 --> 01:43:18.316
More!

01:43:18.401 --> 01:43:20.569
Never say when
Never stop at plenty

01:43:20.653 --> 01:43:22.863
lf it's gonna rain, let it pour

01:43:22.947 --> 01:43:25.073
Happy with ten
Happier with twenty

01:43:25.157 --> 01:43:29.995
lf you like a penny
Wouldn't you like many much more?

01:43:30.079 --> 01:43:34.541
Or does that sound too greedy?

01:43:34.625 --> 01:43:39.045
That's not greed, no indeedy

01:43:39.130 --> 01:43:43.174
That's just stocking the store

01:43:43.259 --> 01:43:45.886
Gotta fill your cupboard
Remember Mother Hubbard

01:43:45.970 --> 01:43:50.223
More!

01:43:50.308 --> 01:43:54.936
Each possession you possess

01:43:55.021 --> 01:43:59.441
Helps your spirits to soar

01:43:59.525 --> 01:44:04.029
That's what's soothing about excess

01:44:04.113 --> 01:44:07.782
Something's better than nothing, yes!

01:44:07.867 --> 01:44:12.746
But nothing's better than
more, more, more

01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:15.248
Except all, all, all

01:44:15.333 --> 01:44:21.796
Except once you have it all

01:44:21.881 --> 01:44:23.882
Have it all

01:44:23.966 --> 01:44:29.137
You may find all else above

01:44:29.221 --> 01:44:32.015
Else above

01:44:32.683 --> 01:44:36.353
That though things

01:44:36.437 --> 01:44:38.563
Are bliss

01:44:39.398 --> 01:44:45.320
There's one thing you miss

01:44:46.447 --> 01:44:48.657
And

01:44:49.867 --> 01:44:51.993
That's

01:44:53.037 --> 01:44:57.666
More!

01:44:57.750 --> 01:44:59.960
More! More! More! More!

01:45:00.044 --> 01:45:01.753
More! More! More!
