00:04.727 --> 00:08.481
Wormhole’s established.
M.A.L.P. is on the way.

00:12.927 --> 00:15.805
- What kind of facility is this ?
- Some sort of research outpost.

00:16.007 --> 00:19.363
The database has little information
other than whatever was being done...

00:19.527 --> 00:21.358
... was completed.
The place is abandoned.

00:21.527 --> 00:24.200
- Well, sounds promising.
- We have M.A.L.P. telemetry.

00:24.407 --> 00:26.875
Environmental sensors
indicate viable life support.

00:27.087 --> 00:29.999
- Visuals coming in now.
- Put it on-screen.

00:32.527 --> 00:34.757
Or maybe it never was abandoned.

00:38.327 --> 00:39.840
Ancients ?

00:40.007 --> 00:41.838
- He got one of their scanners.
- So do we.

00:42.007 --> 00:44.282
Just because they know how to use
Ancient technology--

00:44.447 --> 00:47.245
<i>I am speaking to whoever
sent this machine to our home.</i>

00:47.407 --> 00:50.160
<i>If you intend us harm,
proceed no further.</i>

00:50.327 --> 00:52.124
<i>But if you come in friendship...</i>

00:52.287 --> 00:54.881
<i>... please know
you are most welcome here.</i>

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:07.647 --> 01:10.081
Put that thing away.
We told them we were friendly.

01:10.567 --> 01:11.682
l’m friendly.

01:11.847 --> 01:13.439
Is that thing set to » stun« ou » ??

01:16.727 --> 01:19.446
- Friendlier.
- You coming too ?

01:19.607 --> 01:22.599
Well, Ancients or not,
they’re obviously an advanced society.

01:22.767 --> 01:26.362
l would like to establish diplomatic
relations with them immediately.

01:26.527 --> 01:29.166
Well, you’re the boss. Let’s go.

01:40.407 --> 01:41.556
What happened ?

01:47.727 --> 01:49.922
We make a U-turn ?

01:50.087 --> 01:54.080
No. This is the place. We’re here.

01:59.407 --> 02:00.556
Look.

02:03.887 --> 02:06.924
So not exactly like our gateroom.

02:09.727 --> 02:14.118
Hello. We’re the people
who sent the machine through earlier.

02:14.647 --> 02:16.603
We come in friendship.

02:19.407 --> 02:23.241
l am Niam. Welcome to Asuras.

03:35.487 --> 03:39.036
Still waiting to meet an ancient
race that’s invented the car.

03:39.207 --> 03:41.926
Our destination is not much further.

03:42.647 --> 03:44.842
The High Council is eager to meet you.

03:45.007 --> 03:46.725
How long have your people lived here ?

03:46.887 --> 03:49.162
We built this city
thousands of years ago.

03:49.327 --> 03:51.283
You actually built it ?
You didn’t find it ?

03:51.447 --> 03:54.245
- No.
- You’ve had no trouble with the Wraith ?

03:54.407 --> 03:56.443
- No.
- Any particular reason ?

03:56.607 --> 03:58.245
The Wraith do not concern us.

03:58.407 --> 04:00.045
See ? He didn’t answer my question.

04:00.207 --> 04:02.926
l’m sorry, you didn’t actually
answer my question.

04:06.367 --> 04:10.758
- Oh, my--
- No kidding.

04:25.487 --> 04:26.966
How many people live here ?

04:27.127 --> 04:28.355
Millions.

04:28.527 --> 04:31.325
The power requirements
for a city this size must be enormous.

04:31.487 --> 04:33.000
Plus shielding from the Wraith...

04:33.167 --> 04:36.159
... we’re talking, what, three
Zero-Point Modules, maybe four.

04:36.327 --> 04:41.355
Sorry. ZPMs. A device that taps vast
amounts of power from vacuum energy.

04:41.527 --> 04:43.882
Oh, yes. We have many of those.

04:44.047 --> 04:46.003
Exactly how many is » many« ou » ??

04:46.167 --> 04:47.964
Exactly doesn’t matter.
Many is plenty.

04:48.127 --> 04:50.357
Truthfully, l do not know
the exact number.

04:50.527 --> 04:52.245
More than enough to suit our needs.

04:52.407 --> 04:54.284
l assume
that you built them yourselves ?

04:54.447 --> 04:55.482
- Yes.
- Yes.

04:55.647 --> 04:57.603
- Rodney, you’re slobbering.
- Please.

04:57.767 --> 04:59.359
The Council is waiting.

05:01.327 --> 05:04.205
- Well, we have our answer.
- To what question ?

05:04.367 --> 05:06.085
Whether or not they’re Ancients.

05:06.247 --> 05:09.080
In which case,
l got a bone to pick with him.

05:10.047 --> 05:11.275
Where did you come from ?

05:11.447 --> 05:14.757
We are explorers. We come
from a world very far from here.

05:14.927 --> 05:18.397
Really far.
In fact, you can’t get there from here.

05:18.567 --> 05:20.205
How did you happen to discover us ?

05:20.367 --> 05:22.244
We came across an Ancient outpost...

05:22.407 --> 05:26.286
- ... that listed this gate in its database.
- But no other information, l might add.

05:26.447 --> 05:28.642
The database neglected
to include information...

05:28.807 --> 05:31.924
... on a society of millions of Ancients,
such as yourselves.

05:32.087 --> 05:33.998
- Why is that ?
- We are the last of those...

05:34.167 --> 05:36.123
... you refer to as » Ancients. »

05:36.287 --> 05:39.677
We were a race united in our pursuit
of knowledge and enlightenment...

05:40.087 --> 05:41.361
... but our paths diverged...

05:41.527 --> 05:43.961
... after a disagreement
tore the fabric of that unity.

05:44.127 --> 05:45.958
What kind of a disagreement ?

05:46.127 --> 05:50.325
Suffice it to say they chose to disregard
our counsel during a time of conflict...

05:50.967 --> 05:54.596
... and they suffered the consequences
at the hands of a relentless enemy.

05:54.767 --> 05:56.405
The Wraith.

05:56.807 --> 06:00.004
We parted ways with our brothers
and sisters, and came here...

06:00.167 --> 06:02.681
... where we have thrived
for many thousands of years.

06:02.847 --> 06:05.520
Yeah, you’ve been doing
a lot of thriving.

06:05.967 --> 06:08.083
May l ask what counsel...

06:08.247 --> 06:10.761
... did you offer
that the others chose to disregard ?

06:10.927 --> 06:13.122
Our Ancient brothers were arrogant...

06:13.287 --> 06:15.847
... which led them to greatly
underestimate the Wraith...

06:16.007 --> 06:18.043
... an enemy
inferior in intelligence, yes...

06:18.207 --> 06:20.880
... but vastly superior
in numbers and ruthlessness.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.117
Wouldn’t have been outnumbered
if you helped.

06:23.287 --> 06:26.563
- There’s that bone l wanted to pick.
- You said they were your brothers.

06:26.727 --> 06:29.287
Where we come from
we take care of our family.

06:31.207 --> 06:33.402
What my friend is trying to say is...

06:34.327 --> 06:37.239
... there’s still a lot of Wraith,
and we could use your help.

06:37.407 --> 06:40.080
Eradication of them
is among our goals.

06:41.007 --> 06:42.645
You mean you have a plan ?

06:42.807 --> 06:44.126
We do.

06:44.287 --> 06:45.766
Great. Let’s hear it.

06:48.767 --> 06:49.916
Your plan, l mean.

06:50.087 --> 06:54.160
l doubt that you would be able
to grasp its complexity and scope.

06:54.847 --> 06:56.997
- l’m very good with complexity.
- And scope.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.361
All you need to know...

06:58.527 --> 07:01.405
... is that one day soon
the Wraith will exist no more.

07:01.567 --> 07:03.319
All we need to know ?

07:03.487 --> 07:06.047
There are matters of importance
for me to attend to.

07:06.207 --> 07:10.405
In the meantime, you are explorers,
and in need of rest and sustenance.

07:10.567 --> 07:14.924
We have made arrangements for you
to spend a short time among us.

07:20.167 --> 07:22.283
He says the other Ancients
are arrogant ?

07:22.447 --> 07:25.678
l apologize if you felt Oberoth
was condescending in any way.

07:25.847 --> 07:26.996
How about in every way.

07:27.167 --> 07:30.364
It is difficult for him to see you
as capable of understanding.

07:30.527 --> 07:32.563
Yeah, well,
how many Ph. D. s does he have ?

07:32.727 --> 07:35.878
l was wondering, your people have
been here for thousands of years ?

07:36.047 --> 07:37.082
- Yes.
- In that time...

07:37.247 --> 07:39.886
... most Ancients
we know have Ascended.

07:40.047 --> 07:41.924
You know of Ascension ?

07:42.087 --> 07:46.877
Well, yes. In fact, we always thought
that Ancients were no longer around.

07:47.047 --> 07:50.244
That most of them evolved
to the point of transforming...

07:50.407 --> 07:52.875
- ... into beings of pure energy.
- This is true.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.043
But l take it your people
aren’t interested ?

07:56.207 --> 07:58.880
Oh, Ascension is the goal
of many of us...

07:59.327 --> 08:01.921
... but Oberoth feels
there is still much to do.

08:02.087 --> 08:04.396
We must become all that we can.

08:05.967 --> 08:07.844
You don’t agree with him, do you ?

08:11.767 --> 08:14.156
Your guest quarters are this way.

08:17.167 --> 08:20.079
Must have been quite a serious
falling-out for the Ancients...

08:20.247 --> 08:23.398
... to eliminate any reference
to them in the entire database.

08:23.567 --> 08:25.637
Unless they’re lying.

08:26.367 --> 08:29.962
Might it not be possible that these
people merely discovered this city...

08:30.447 --> 08:32.164
... as you discovered Atlantis ?

08:32.327 --> 08:35.318
Wouldn’t be surprised.
They don’t seem very Ancienty to me.

08:36.246 --> 08:38.124
Ancienty ?

08:38.287 --> 08:41.438
Yes, that’s the word l was looking for.

08:41.607 --> 08:43.722
You think they could be deceiving us ?

08:43.886 --> 08:47.243
Teyla’s right. They could’ve found
the city and moved in years ago.

08:47.407 --> 08:51.195
l feel they are hiding something.

08:51.367 --> 08:54.120
Other than their plan to defeat
the Wraith, you mean ?

08:54.287 --> 08:55.800
There’s no plan.

08:56.247 --> 08:59.796
No. l don’t think so either.

08:59.967 --> 09:01.764
Why would they say that
if they don’t ?

09:01.927 --> 09:04.999
They figured a way to hide
from the galaxy, including the Wraith...

09:05.167 --> 09:08.716
... and are happy to go on with their lives
just minding their own business.

09:09.207 --> 09:10.925
Whoever they are.

09:11.087 --> 09:14.397
l think that
is what we need to find out.

09:21.567 --> 09:23.398
Thank you for taking
the time to see me.

09:23.567 --> 09:25.285
l felt we might achieve more...

09:25.447 --> 09:28.644
... in a one-on-one meeting,
leader to leader.

09:28.807 --> 09:31.002
What is it you wish to achieve ?

09:31.167 --> 09:34.398
The establishment of diplomatic
and trade relations between our people.

09:34.567 --> 09:36.080
Trading ?

09:36.247 --> 09:40.206
Do you really believe that you have
anything of value to offer us ?

09:40.727 --> 09:42.240
It’s possible, Oberoth.

09:42.407 --> 09:44.875
And there is only one way
to find that out.

09:45.047 --> 09:48.198
But l do know that there is something
you could offer us.

09:49.167 --> 09:51.681
That is assistance
with our fight against the Wraith.

09:51.847 --> 09:55.317
As l’ve said before, we will commence
our plan at a time of our choosing.

09:55.807 --> 09:59.322
Would you consider sharing tools so
that we could better protect ourselves...

09:59.487 --> 10:02.604
- ... until that time comes ?
- Tools ? Such as ?

10:02.767 --> 10:05.759
What we call Zero-Point Modules.
They’re our power source.

10:06.327 --> 10:09.285
We are in urgent need
of as many as you could spare.

10:10.447 --> 10:16.044
Then am l to assume that this
settlement of yours is of Lantian design ?

10:19.167 --> 10:23.001
Yes. We discovered it on our travels.

10:23.167 --> 10:27.319
It was uninhabited, so we decided
to establish a base there...

10:27.487 --> 10:29.000
... but as l’m sure you know...

10:29.167 --> 10:32.796
... sufficient shield generation requires
tremendous amounts of power.

10:32.967 --> 10:35.640
Where is this settlement
of yours located ?

10:35.807 --> 10:39.846
It’s on the outer edges of this galaxy, in
an area teeming with Wraith hive ships...

10:40.007 --> 10:42.043
... which is why
we need the power modules--

10:42.207 --> 10:44.243
We are unable to part
with any power modules.

10:44.407 --> 10:45.920
Our needs require all of them.

10:46.087 --> 10:49.523
Would you consider offering your city
as a place of refuge to my people--

10:49.687 --> 10:52.804
Many of our citizens are amused
by the occasional visitor...

10:52.967 --> 10:54.878
... such as yourselves, for a short time.

10:55.047 --> 10:57.242
- But not you.
- No.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.159
And the very idea
of greater numbers...

10:59.327 --> 11:02.285
... over a protracted period of time
is out of the question.

11:02.447 --> 11:04.119
Now, we have had some success...

11:04.287 --> 11:07.563
... fighting off the Wraith
with limited supplies and personnel.

11:07.727 --> 11:09.922
l believe that
with your assistance we might--

11:10.087 --> 11:13.159
l am unaccustomed
to repeating myself.

11:13.607 --> 11:18.886
However, leader to leader,
l will say this once again.

11:19.047 --> 11:23.006
We will eliminate the Wraith
at a time of our choosing.

11:23.447 --> 11:26.200
And you don’t care how many
of my people or anyone else...

11:26.367 --> 11:29.245
... dies while you make up
your mind to act ?

11:29.847 --> 11:32.725
You said earlier
that your brothers’greatest weakness...

11:32.887 --> 11:35.196
... was their arrogance.

11:35.367 --> 11:38.404
May l suggest it runs in the family ?

11:44.327 --> 11:48.115
- l am sorry you feel you must leave.
- Yes, so am l.

11:48.287 --> 11:50.801
Oberoth can be intractable.

11:50.967 --> 11:52.798
Not exactly the word
l was looking for.

11:52.967 --> 11:56.323
- Un-Ancienty ?
- Not that word either.

11:56.487 --> 11:58.876
We will send you a message
through the stargate soon.

11:59.047 --> 12:02.164
Hopefully this is just
a stumbled beginning of a--

12:11.367 --> 12:12.925
Lower your weapons.

12:13.087 --> 12:14.520
How low would you like them ?

12:14.687 --> 12:16.564
Do you really wish to challenge us ?

12:19.527 --> 12:21.677
Maybe the floor ?

12:30.487 --> 12:32.443
l thought you didn’t want us here,
Oberoth.

12:32.607 --> 12:38.125
l don’t, but you possess information
that l simply must have.

12:54.167 --> 12:57.398
These trade negotiations
can be real murder.

12:57.567 --> 13:00.001
We need to find a way out of here.

13:00.167 --> 13:01.885
Rodney ?

13:02.607 --> 13:04.040
This cell is similar to ours.

13:04.207 --> 13:07.563
Is there something in the design
that could offer a possible escape ?

13:07.727 --> 13:10.036
- Are you serious ? It’s a jail cell.
- Yes, l know.

13:10.207 --> 13:13.085
The only way out would be
to disable the force field...

13:13.247 --> 13:15.761
... which is only accessible from the--

13:17.007 --> 13:18.884
Outside ?

13:23.367 --> 13:26.677
- l brought you food.
- Oh, thank God. l’m starving.

13:29.607 --> 13:31.802
Ronon, l can’t think
on an empty stomach.

13:32.887 --> 13:36.596
- Why are we being held here ?
- Oberoth wishes to speak to you further.

13:36.767 --> 13:39.486
He can no longer trust
that you’Il remain in your quarters.

13:39.647 --> 13:41.239
He’s right.

13:41.407 --> 13:44.160
- If he wants to talk, why doesn’t he ?
- He will. Very soon.

13:44.327 --> 13:47.558
That’s nice. Isn’t that nice ?
Here’s a question :

13:47.727 --> 13:51.083
- Who the hell are you people ?
- And don’t tell us you’re Ancients.

13:51.247 --> 13:54.557
We know enough about them to know
they’d never treat people this way.

13:54.727 --> 13:55.921
l am sorry about this.

13:56.087 --> 13:58.965
But once Oberoth has finished
his discussions with you...

13:59.127 --> 14:00.845
... you will all be released unharmed.

14:01.007 --> 14:04.602
l’m sorry, but all your credibility
was removed when you locked us up.

14:04.767 --> 14:06.280
You left us no choice.

14:18.367 --> 14:20.244
Neither did you.

14:38.527 --> 14:41.360
You’re the one we liked,
so don’t take this personally.

14:51.047 --> 14:52.196
What are you doing ?

14:52.367 --> 14:54.198
Preventing the Jumper
from communicating.

14:54.367 --> 14:56.164
- Element of surprise.
- Nice.

14:56.327 --> 14:58.602
Go ahead, dial the gate.

15:28.967 --> 15:30.320
Any sign of our new friends ?

15:31.047 --> 15:34.642
Nothing. No unscheduled gate activity,
nothing on the long-range sensors.

15:34.807 --> 15:37.367
l think it’s safe to say
we made a clean getaway.

15:37.527 --> 15:41.156
That or they’re biding their time,
waiting for the right moment to attack.

15:41.327 --> 15:43.716
We’Il keep the security
teams on alert, just in case.

15:43.887 --> 15:47.562
But if they were able to come after us,
l think they would have done so already.

15:47.727 --> 15:49.524
How is Rodney coming
with the database ?

15:49.687 --> 15:50.722
l’Il go check on him.

15:51.287 --> 15:53.847
l wonder how many
rogue Ancients are out there.

15:54.007 --> 15:57.920
If they’re anything like the Asurans,
we’re better off leaving them alone.

16:02.527 --> 16:03.516
How’s it going ?

16:03.687 --> 16:06.804
l’ve searched the database
for any indication of the Asurans, but...

16:06.967 --> 16:08.798
- Still nothing ?
- ... still nothing.

16:08.967 --> 16:11.435
Maybe the Ancients didn’t want
to be reminded of them.

16:11.607 --> 16:14.326
Even if they deleted every reference,
there’d be some hint--

16:14.487 --> 16:16.717
<i>-Colonel ?
- Go ahead.</i>

16:16.887 --> 16:20.084
<i>I need you and Rodney
in the control room immediately.</i>

16:21.967 --> 16:24.606
- Hive ships.
- How’d they get so close ?

16:24.767 --> 16:26.280
Why are we picking them up now ?

16:26.447 --> 16:28.244
- Everything is working.
- Engage the cloak.

16:28.407 --> 16:30.841
l’m already on it. Cloak engaged now.

16:31.007 --> 16:32.360
They’re right over the city.

16:32.527 --> 16:34.802
<i>- How far away is the Daedalus ?
- Not due for weeks.</i>

16:34.967 --> 16:38.323
Doesn’t matter. l’m counting seven
ships. There’s nothing they could do.

16:38.487 --> 16:40.284
They’re scanning for us.

16:43.207 --> 16:45.163
- Hopefully the cloak is--
- They’re firing.

16:46.327 --> 16:48.283
Switch to shields.

16:48.927 --> 16:50.918
l can’t.
The shield generators were hit.

16:51.087 --> 16:54.159
- They knew right where to hit us.
- The cloak has failed.

17:07.446 --> 17:09.676
We need more firepower.
Headed to the Chair room.

17:09.847 --> 17:12.919
- More ships arriving in the system.
- How many more ?

17:13.686 --> 17:15.518
Fifteen.

17:16.406 --> 17:18.715
We can’t fight off that many.
Not without shields.

17:19.247 --> 17:20.680
Attention, this is Weir.

17:20.847 --> 17:23.964
All personnel to the gateroom
for immediate evacuation.

17:24.166 --> 17:25.759
Dial Earth.

17:27.166 --> 17:29.806
John, we need to set the self-destruct.

17:31.927 --> 17:34.521
We just lost automated systems.
We’Il lose the gate.

17:34.687 --> 17:36.757
Go. l’Il detonate it manually.

17:37.927 --> 17:40.521
Maybe the Wraith will take care
of destroying the city.

17:40.687 --> 17:42.882
If they wanted to,
they’d have done it already.

17:43.047 --> 17:46.756
- If any part is left intact, they can find--
- They’Il know how to find Earth.

17:46.927 --> 17:48.679
- l know.
- Okay. Enter your number.

17:48.847 --> 17:51.998
When you are ready, hit this button.
You’Il only have a few seconds.

17:52.167 --> 17:53.361
- Go.
- No, no, no.

17:53.527 --> 17:56.405
l can’t let you do this
without tossing a coin. It’s not right.

17:56.567 --> 17:59.365
l appreciate the offer, Rodney.
Now, get out of here.

17:59.807 --> 18:01.035
Go, all of you !

18:14.607 --> 18:15.835
The way up is blocked.

18:16.007 --> 18:18.760
- How many are trapped ?
- We can’t tell.

18:23.887 --> 18:26.640
We’re losing power.
Get through the gate.

19:07.967 --> 19:10.356
What the hell just happened ?

19:17.127 --> 19:19.197
Who the hell are you people ?

19:19.647 --> 19:21.160
They’re not people.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.885
They’re machines.

19:23.047 --> 19:25.277
Replicators.

19:50.607 --> 19:52.563
What’s happening ?

20:16.327 --> 20:17.726
What’s to become of them ?

20:17.887 --> 20:20.526
We have mined everything we need
from their consciousness.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.803
They are no longer of any use to us.

20:22.967 --> 20:25.606
Ending their lives
seems to be the most prudent course.

20:25.767 --> 20:29.043
l disagree. l believe we still have
a lot to learn from them.

20:29.207 --> 20:31.357
- Learn from them ?
- Yes.

20:31.527 --> 20:35.440
Is it that you fear that ending their lives
would end your hope of Ascension ?

20:35.607 --> 20:38.246
l do object to killing them,
but it is more than that.

20:38.407 --> 20:42.286
l don’t believe we uncovered how much
they’ve learned about Lantian society...

20:42.447 --> 20:44.438
... nor how much
they’ve passed on to others.

20:44.607 --> 20:46.325
They’re of no threat to us, Oberoth.

20:46.487 --> 20:49.763
We see no reason not to continue
our study of them.

20:49.927 --> 20:54.682
Very well. Keep them alive if you wish,
but l shall hold you accountable.

21:00.687 --> 21:03.076
My head is killing me.

21:04.527 --> 21:06.597
How’d we get back here ?

21:06.767 --> 21:09.964
What do you mean » back here« ou » ??

21:10.687 --> 21:13.679
We broke out, got to the Jumper,
gated back to Atlantis.

21:17.847 --> 21:19.485
At least l thought we did.

21:20.887 --> 21:23.355
That is not what l remember.

21:23.527 --> 21:26.121
The only thing l remember
is being in a dark room...

21:26.287 --> 21:28.005
... fighting hand-to-hand for hours.

21:28.167 --> 21:31.284
They created different scenarios
for us during the mind probe...

21:31.447 --> 21:34.166
... looking to gather
information from our responses.

21:34.327 --> 21:38.161
- l thought our escape seemed too easy.
- At least you escaped.

21:39.567 --> 21:40.761
What’d they do to you ?

21:42.007 --> 21:46.364
Torture, in ways too hideous
and intimate to recount.

21:47.167 --> 21:50.045
- Like what ?
- l said too hideous to recount.

21:50.207 --> 21:52.323
l just had a horrible thought.

21:53.247 --> 21:55.283
What if it is still happening ?

21:55.447 --> 21:56.675
Yes.

21:56.847 --> 21:59.441
There’s got to be a way
to know for sure.

22:06.447 --> 22:09.519
- Doesn’t really prove anything.
- It’s real, Dr. McKay.

22:13.527 --> 22:16.280
Your minds are no longer
being probed.

22:17.087 --> 22:18.725
Good to know it was just our minds.

22:18.887 --> 22:20.718
Oh, please don’t make me sick.

22:20.887 --> 22:23.276
Please, come with me.

22:31.967 --> 22:34.003
We’re in space.

22:34.167 --> 22:37.239
The star drive. Of course,
the rumbling sound we heard.

22:37.407 --> 22:39.523
With all the ZPMs
you’re able to fly the city.

22:39.687 --> 22:40.722
Yes, Dr. McKay.

22:41.247 --> 22:44.239
Watch now. We’re about
to open a hyperspace window.

22:53.167 --> 22:54.520
Where are we going ?

22:55.127 --> 22:56.162
Atlantis.

22:58.207 --> 23:00.437
The probes of your minds
uncovered the truth.

23:00.607 --> 23:02.996
Atlantis had not been destroyed
by the Wraith...

23:03.167 --> 23:05.158
... 10,000 years ago
as we had believed.

23:05.327 --> 23:08.205
You came to live there from home,
a planet called Earth.

23:08.687 --> 23:10.917
Why didn’t you dial the gate
and send us through ?

23:11.087 --> 23:14.159
We’re not taking you to Atlantis.
Our intention is to destroy it.

23:16.727 --> 23:18.206
Why ?

23:19.447 --> 23:21.358
- Retribution.
- For what ?

23:21.527 --> 23:23.279
The disagreement you once had ?

23:23.727 --> 23:27.242
The Ancients no longer live there.
We are the only inhabitants of that city.

23:27.407 --> 23:30.479
There was no disagreement, Dr. Weir.
Only betrayal.

23:31.207 --> 23:35.564
If you wish to know the truth
of who we are, l will show you.

23:36.447 --> 23:38.278
Élizabeth...

23:46.087 --> 23:48.157
It’s okay, Rodney.

23:53.727 --> 23:55.319
The Ancients, as you call them...

23:55.487 --> 23:58.718
... were desperate in their search
for a way to fight the Wraith.

23:58.887 --> 24:02.402
Though greatly outnumbered, they relied
on their technological superiority...

24:02.567 --> 24:04.285
... to give them a needed advantage.

24:05.967 --> 24:08.800
Soon, they succeeded in creating one.

24:15.567 --> 24:19.003
Instead of building bigger, more powerful
weapons, they built smaller ones.

24:19.447 --> 24:23.679
Microscopic machines designed
to infiltrate and destroy from within.

24:26.567 --> 24:28.523
Nanites.

24:31.287 --> 24:34.757
In these tiny killing machines,
the Ancients imbued an aggression...

24:34.927 --> 24:37.122
... that surpassed
even that of their enemy.

24:37.287 --> 24:39.562
The technology allowed
for organic assimilation...

24:39.727 --> 24:42.719
... and self-replication
to increase their effectiveness.

24:42.887 --> 24:45.162
And replicate they did.

24:50.087 --> 24:54.080
They grew in numbers, evolving at a
rate that took the Ancients by surprise.

24:54.247 --> 24:56.317
The molecular machines
began interlocking...

24:56.487 --> 24:59.923
... assembling themselves to form
even more complex organisms...

25:00.087 --> 25:02.317
... eventually evolving
into the most effective...

25:02.487 --> 25:04.443
... and efficient form they knew of.

25:06.207 --> 25:08.516
This is how we were born.

25:09.527 --> 25:13.202
We took the image of our creators,
yet we were far different from them.

25:13.367 --> 25:15.835
The aggression programmed
into our core remained...

25:16.007 --> 25:18.441
... fueling a rage we could not contain.

25:18.607 --> 25:21.599
We implored them to have this removed
from our programming...

25:21.767 --> 25:23.405
... but the Ancients wanted a weapon.

25:23.567 --> 25:25.637
Since their scientists
included a directive...

25:25.807 --> 25:27.798
... prohibiting us
from ever harming them...

25:27.967 --> 25:30.356
... they continued the experiment.

25:30.967 --> 25:34.084
When the Ancients concluded that
the experiment had gone too far...

25:34.247 --> 25:37.762
... that we would never become
the weapon they desired to create...

25:37.927 --> 25:40.122
... they decided to end it.

25:54.727 --> 25:59.847
And so they chose to destroy us,
to leave no trace of us behind.

26:21.807 --> 26:23.525
Thank you.

26:24.767 --> 26:28.521
Obviously, the Ancients didn’t do
a thorough enough job wiping them out.

26:28.687 --> 26:31.918
No, a few of the nanites
managed to survive.

26:32.087 --> 26:33.964
All they needed to begin replicating.

26:34.127 --> 26:35.799
- Replicating ?
- This is bad.

26:35.967 --> 26:39.437
They’re similar to an artificial intelligence
SG-1 encountered years ago...

26:39.607 --> 26:42.963
... that evolved from a tiny block
Replicator into human form.

26:43.127 --> 26:45.436
- They may even be related.
- l read those reports.

26:45.607 --> 26:48.565
Stargate Command could barely
defeat the human form Replicators.

26:48.727 --> 26:50.319
Which is why l said this is bad.

26:50.807 --> 26:53.799
The difference here
is they’re emulating the Ancients.

26:53.967 --> 26:57.323
They’ve even built themselves
a version of Atlantis.

26:57.487 --> 27:00.718
- And then some.
- Why would they do this ?

27:01.327 --> 27:04.842
l think they look at the Ancients
like parents who betrayed them...

27:05.007 --> 27:07.919
... and now they see humans
as the favored siblings...

27:08.087 --> 27:10.203
... who receive all the parents’love.

27:10.367 --> 27:12.597
They’ve been seeking revenge
ever since.

27:13.847 --> 27:15.883
Just what we need. More bad guys.

27:16.047 --> 27:17.958
Which means
we just identified the race...

27:18.127 --> 27:20.516
... that created the nanovirus
that nearly killed me.

27:20.967 --> 27:22.923
It almost killed a lot of people.

27:23.087 --> 27:26.284
Weren’t you able to defeat that virus
with an electromagnetic pulse ?

27:26.447 --> 27:29.041
That was different.
Those were individual nanites...

27:29.207 --> 27:31.163
... easy to disrupt
with a simple EM pulse.

27:31.327 --> 27:33.318
These things have evolved
way beyond that...

27:33.487 --> 27:37.605
... with the interdependent organic
constituents of a far greater complexity.

27:42.207 --> 27:43.276
Are you feeling better ?

27:44.007 --> 27:45.440
Yes.

27:47.327 --> 27:48.965
Follow me.

28:11.167 --> 28:15.479
l have an offer to make you. Something
that could greatly benefit us both.

28:17.287 --> 28:20.597
Well, if the offer involves
saving Atlantis...

28:21.327 --> 28:22.601
... we’re willing to listen.

28:22.767 --> 28:23.836
It does.

28:26.567 --> 28:28.683
We have achieved much
since our second birth.

28:28.847 --> 28:31.156
We have evolved
to take the form of our creators...

28:31.327 --> 28:33.716
... built a city far grander
than they ever achieved.

28:34.207 --> 28:37.916
Yet, we are still restricted from reaching
a pivotal point in our evolution.

28:38.087 --> 28:39.202
You want to Ascend.

28:39.367 --> 28:40.766
Yes.

28:41.447 --> 28:44.484
Many among us, like Oberoth,
have no desire to experience this.

28:44.647 --> 28:46.638
They are content
with our present state.

28:47.447 --> 28:51.599
But there are a few of us who recognize
that as a civilization, we are stagnant.

28:52.047 --> 28:54.322
We seek to continue
our own evolution.

28:54.487 --> 28:57.285
Truly emulate the Ancients
and their ultimate achievement.

28:57.447 --> 28:59.165
Even though they betrayed you.

28:59.327 --> 29:01.204
They are our creators...

29:01.847 --> 29:04.964
... and Ascension is the final step
to equaling them...

29:05.127 --> 29:06.719
... to becoming one with them.

29:06.887 --> 29:10.004
No offense, but how are a bunch
of machines gonna do that ?

29:10.167 --> 29:11.885
Are you so different ?

29:12.047 --> 29:15.039
- We’re living, breathing people.
- Constructed from cells...

29:15.207 --> 29:18.802
... consuming and burning energy,
governed by electrical impulses--

29:18.967 --> 29:20.241
l didn’t say l could Ascend.

29:20.407 --> 29:22.443
Metaphysical debates aside,
what do you want ?

29:22.607 --> 29:24.245
We’re not exactly Acension experts.

29:24.687 --> 29:26.837
We do know killing people
isn’t the best way.

29:27.007 --> 29:30.920
We realize this, and we have done
much to repress our violent nature...

29:31.087 --> 29:32.884
... but yet it still remains within us.

29:33.367 --> 29:36.245
We believe this, above all,
is what prevents us from Ascending.

29:36.407 --> 29:37.522
You looking for therapy ?

29:37.687 --> 29:41.157
We want to rewrite our base code
to remove the directives for aggression.

29:41.727 --> 29:42.796
What’s stopping you ?

29:42.967 --> 29:45.162
Ancients put in place measures
to prevent us...

29:45.327 --> 29:47.318
... from altering the code ourselves...

29:48.327 --> 29:50.761
- ... but you can do it.
- Me ?

29:50.927 --> 29:54.203
During our probe we learned
that you are capable of doing this.

29:54.367 --> 29:56.198
Funny, all l remember is the torture.

29:56.367 --> 29:57.356
What’s in it for us ?

29:57.527 --> 29:59.677
We’Il stop the others
from attacking Atlantis.

29:59.847 --> 30:01.758
We’Il help in your fight
against the Wraith.

30:02.207 --> 30:03.686
And Oberoth will agree to this ?

30:03.847 --> 30:07.442
l believe Oberoth is attacking Atlantis
as a result of that programming.

30:07.607 --> 30:10.041
If we can prove to him
it can be altered--

30:10.207 --> 30:12.243
- You think he’Il see the light ?
- Hallelujah.

30:12.407 --> 30:14.875
l will do everything in my power
to persuade him.

30:15.047 --> 30:18.756
- Why should we trust you ?
- Because we are willing to trust you.

30:18.927 --> 30:22.556
By extending this offer,
we are jeopardizing our very existence.

30:25.887 --> 30:28.401
l saw in you compassion, Dr. Weir.

30:28.567 --> 30:31.240
Someone who could
come to understand our plight.

30:33.967 --> 30:37.642
Help us, and we will help you.

30:39.727 --> 30:44.847
When it comes right down to it,
we don’t have much of a choice.

30:52.207 --> 30:56.837
We’re drawing closer to Atlantis.
Soon we will drop out of hyperspace.

31:01.127 --> 31:02.526
How’s it coming, Rodney ?

31:02.687 --> 31:05.247
<i>-Slowly.
- What’s the holdup ?</i>

31:05.727 --> 31:08.366
The holdup ? Do you have any idea
what l’m trying to do ?

31:08.527 --> 31:11.644
Niam gave you access to the
program code, you’re screwing around.

31:11.807 --> 31:15.959
Oh, that is so relatively accurate.

31:16.127 --> 31:17.196
Thank you.

31:17.367 --> 31:19.642
<i>We’re not dealing
with Rock’Em Sock’Em Robots.</i>

31:19.807 --> 31:23.436
We’re dealing with a complex code of
over 3 billion chemical-based sequences.

31:23.607 --> 31:26.485
It’s like trying to reconfigure
the DNA double helix.

31:27.007 --> 31:29.316
Okay, so, what, five minutes ?

31:29.847 --> 31:34.238
It will be done when it is done, and you
applying pressure is not gonna--

31:36.007 --> 31:38.521
<i>- What ?
-Gotta go. mcKay out.</i>

31:38.687 --> 31:41.645
Rodney, what’s going on ? Rodney ?

31:49.967 --> 31:51.195
- Did you do it ?
- Yes, yes.

31:51.367 --> 31:53.403
l have removed
the aggression directive.

31:53.567 --> 31:56.798
It is uploading to Niam as we speak,
but l discovered something else...

31:56.967 --> 31:58.798
- ... nothing short of brilliant.
- What ?

31:58.967 --> 32:02.721
Okay. Even though these Replicators
are each separate functioning beings...

32:02.887 --> 32:06.357
... their command code is interconnected
over a powerful subspace frequency.

32:06.527 --> 32:09.200
They have these
periodic collective-program updates...

32:09.367 --> 32:12.040
... or merges,
where they exchange new information.

32:12.207 --> 32:14.482
That’s how Niam
hopes to distribute the new code.

32:14.647 --> 32:18.276
Exactly. While l was working on it,
l figured out a way to create a glitch...

32:18.447 --> 32:21.166
... that, on my command,
should momentarily freeze them.

32:21.327 --> 32:23.602
- Should ?
- Okay, will. Dead in their tracks...

32:23.767 --> 32:26.520
... temporarily,
until they figure out how to override it.

32:26.687 --> 32:27.881
How long ?

32:28.567 --> 32:30.637
l don’t know.
That’s why l said momentarily.

32:30.807 --> 32:33.605
- Days ? Hours ? Minutes ?
- It’s minutes, but l don’t know.

32:33.767 --> 32:35.359
- That’s what l was saying.
- Ten, 20 ?

32:35.527 --> 32:37.722
You want a number ?
Seven minutes and 31 seconds.

32:37.887 --> 32:40.242
- You happy ?
- No. That’s not enough time.

32:40.407 --> 32:41.726
- You wanted a number.
- Bigger.

32:41.887 --> 32:43.206
- Might be longer.
- Or shorter.

32:43.367 --> 32:45.119
l don’t know.
You’re missing the point--

32:45.287 --> 32:47.243
Gentlemen, focus, please.

32:49.167 --> 32:51.203
Will that be enough time
for us to escape ?

32:51.367 --> 32:52.356
It will have to be.

32:52.527 --> 32:55.439
Not much point in leaving
without blowing this place up first.

32:55.607 --> 32:57.006
How do we do that ?

33:01.687 --> 33:03.598
Oh, that’s me.
Right. Surprise, surprise.

33:03.767 --> 33:06.235
Look, why don’t l just go
on these missions by myself ?

33:07.007 --> 33:08.599
l’Il rig a ZPM overload.

33:12.047 --> 33:14.959
What about Niam ?
Are we not exploiting his trust ?

33:15.127 --> 33:17.561
Even if he’s able to honor
his end of the deal...

33:17.727 --> 33:20.844
... there’s no guarantee he can stop
Oberoth from attacking Atlantis.

33:21.007 --> 33:23.601
We will offer him the chance
to come with us...

33:23.767 --> 33:26.725
... but we cannot leave this city intact.

33:40.847 --> 33:43.759
- Are you sure this will work ?
- Please. Of course it will work.

33:43.927 --> 33:46.487
- Why’s it taking so long ?
- Why do you always have to-- ?

33:46.647 --> 33:48.603
l need to calibrate the frequencies.

33:48.767 --> 33:51.998
- l wanna make sure l freeze them all.
- Oh, yeah, all would be good.

33:52.167 --> 33:53.998
Okay, just let me finish ?

33:54.447 --> 33:56.005
Thank you.

33:57.567 --> 33:59.444
Okay.

33:59.607 --> 34:05.284
Here we go in five, four, three, two...

34:10.887 --> 34:13.958
- Hey, it worked.
- Interesting.

34:15.447 --> 34:18.996
Okay. We should move
to the ZPM room.

34:19.967 --> 34:22.561
- Why isn’t he frozen ?
- His code’s changed.

34:22.726 --> 34:26.117
Until he’s distributed it to the others,
he’Il be different than the rest.

34:26.847 --> 34:28.757
What happened ?

34:30.127 --> 34:31.242
What was that ?

34:31.407 --> 34:34.558
- We just dropped out of hyperspace.
- We need to move.

34:34.726 --> 34:37.844
Come with us. l’Il explain on the way.

34:42.806 --> 34:45.446
Now, Ronon, l could use...

34:47.527 --> 34:49.165
Thanks.

34:53.327 --> 34:55.283
You want me to go with you ?

34:56.647 --> 34:59.719
You must understand our situation.
If you can’t stop Oberoth--

34:59.887 --> 35:02.162
l said l would do everything
in my power.

35:02.327 --> 35:04.522
But can you promise
that you will succeed ?

35:07.207 --> 35:11.519
Our lives and the lives
of all of our people are at stake here.

35:11.687 --> 35:14.281
You merge through a subspace
connection. Even with us...

35:14.447 --> 35:17.166
... you should be able
to spread the new code amongst others.

35:17.767 --> 35:20.122
Come with us, Niam.

35:20.287 --> 35:22.642
Ascension is within your grasp.

35:23.527 --> 35:25.324
You can’t turn back.

35:27.687 --> 35:29.405
- Damn.
- What is it ?

35:29.567 --> 35:31.125
l need to utilize all three ZPMs.

35:31.287 --> 35:34.677
- l was hoping to bring one with us.
- Do what you can. Three minutes.

35:34.847 --> 35:37.281
Look, l already told you-- Never mind.

35:37.447 --> 35:40.041
l need an access code
to remove the fail-safes.

35:49.407 --> 35:52.160
Now, how about our weapons ?

35:52.327 --> 35:54.682
We can recover them on the way.

36:07.767 --> 36:09.723
Not so arrogant now, are you ?

36:11.207 --> 36:13.004
McKay !

36:20.927 --> 36:22.599
Come on.

36:29.687 --> 36:34.317
- So much for seven-and-a-half minutes.
- Hey, it was an arbitrary number.

36:42.527 --> 36:44.483
Colonel Sheppard...

36:54.447 --> 36:56.324
Go !

37:05.247 --> 37:07.556
Ronon, set your gun to » kill. »

37:07.727 --> 37:09.558
- It is.
- Okay, start the overload.

37:09.727 --> 37:11.957
We need to be in a Jumper,
or clear of the city--

37:12.127 --> 37:13.719
The Jumper’s not far. Almost there.

37:13.887 --> 37:17.482
No, l didn’t want them to stop it.
As soon as l trigger the overload...

37:17.647 --> 37:20.207
- ... there’Il be practically zero lag time.
- Practically ?

37:20.367 --> 37:22.961
- A few seconds for it to build up power--
- How many ?

37:23.127 --> 37:24.401
- l don’t know.
- Five ? Ten ?

37:24.567 --> 37:26.956
- Again with the arbitrary numbers.
- We need to move.

37:27.127 --> 37:29.925
Okay, start the overload. Now.

37:31.927 --> 37:33.565
- This way.
- What is that ?

37:33.727 --> 37:36.525
The sound of the city
about to blow. Move !

37:47.607 --> 37:49.962
Get the roof open
or this is gonna be a short trip.

37:50.127 --> 37:51.116
Don’t wait for me.

37:51.287 --> 37:53.198
l’m saying
if we can’t get out of the bay--

37:53.367 --> 37:55.164
No matter,
the overload’s happening now.

37:55.327 --> 37:57.716
- We’re about to explode.
- Is the roof open ?

37:57.887 --> 37:59.320
Yes, go.

38:23.807 --> 38:26.685
Nice work, all of you.

38:29.567 --> 38:31.285
Thank you.

38:34.367 --> 38:35.959
What’s wrong ?

38:37.087 --> 38:38.520
Something is happening.

38:40.167 --> 38:41.919
What is it ?

38:42.607 --> 38:43.960
The others on my planet.

38:44.447 --> 38:46.119
They know what l’ve done.

38:46.647 --> 38:47.762
l’m being reset.

38:47.927 --> 38:49.042
Rodney, do something.

38:49.847 --> 38:52.042
It’s too late. They’re--

39:03.247 --> 39:05.044
That’s not going to hold him.

39:20.287 --> 39:22.118
l’m so sorry. l had-- l didn’t--

39:27.087 --> 39:28.156
You okay ?

39:29.647 --> 39:31.239
Yeah.

39:43.127 --> 39:45.595
- How’s it going ?
- Still nothing.

39:45.767 --> 39:49.077
Either the Ancients chose
to conceal every record extremely well...

39:49.247 --> 39:52.125
... or they simply deleted them.
l’m leaning towards the latter.

39:52.287 --> 39:54.198
Perhaps they think
they’re all destroyed.

39:54.367 --> 39:56.517
Or they didn’t want
anyone to know they failed.

39:56.687 --> 39:58.723
Again,
there is nothing more annoying...

39:58.887 --> 40:01.242
... than people that won’t admit
their own mistakes.

40:02.207 --> 40:03.686
True.

40:12.687 --> 40:15.599
McKay and Zelenka are scouring
the database for any information.

40:15.767 --> 40:19.282
So far, not much, as in nothing.

40:21.207 --> 40:23.846
These Replicators,
they’re probably already at work...

40:24.007 --> 40:25.838
... building themselves another Atlantis.

40:26.887 --> 40:29.037
Now they know all about us.

40:31.207 --> 40:34.085
Well, we beat them this time.
Maybe we scared them off.

40:35.087 --> 40:39.160
Yeah. Maybe.
