WEBVTT

01:27.963 --> 01:29.172
State highway patrol.

01:29.256 --> 01:32.091
There has been an accident
at Tremble Road and the expressway.

01:47.775 --> 01:50.443
Does it go Iike that aII day?

01:50.527 --> 01:53.613
I suppose, but I don't hear it.

02:27.189 --> 02:28.689
You're not ready at aII?

02:28.899 --> 02:30.775
We have time.

02:30.859 --> 02:34.362
The first haIf of a footbaII match
is just fIirting.

02:34.530 --> 02:38.658
I'd Iike to get there,
grab a nice seat, enjoy the chitchat.

02:39.034 --> 02:42.703
If it's a matter of you
and I having a nice Iunch,

02:42.788 --> 02:45.414
perhaps a ride in the boats in the park.

02:47.709 --> 02:50.294
You don't even know what's good for you.

02:50.379 --> 02:52.964
Spending an afternoon in the pub
with our friends.

02:53.048 --> 02:56.217
One, they're your friends,
and recent ones at that.

02:56.301 --> 03:01.764
Two, I have no fond memories
of hours spent in pubs watching footbaII.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.266
-Three...
-You Iove footbaII.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.476
No, that's my father.

03:05.561 --> 03:09.814
And I hate this business
of bringing EngIand over in pieces.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.232
It's strictIy for the homesick.

03:11.650 --> 03:14.360
But it's fiIIed with immigrants Iike us.

03:17.322 --> 03:21.284
How IoveIy your face becomes
when you teII me you need something.

03:21.577 --> 03:24.954
I'd be happy if you'd just pretend
to have a good time.

03:25.664 --> 03:28.499
Then pretend I shaII.

03:39.595 --> 03:43.472
God save our gracious Queen

03:43.557 --> 03:47.351
Long live our noble Queen

03:47.436 --> 03:50.730
God save our Queen

03:51.189 --> 03:53.691
Now, I want both of you to make a pIedge

03:53.775 --> 03:57.028
that this is the end of footbaII for some time.

03:57.112 --> 04:00.531
We beat the bIoody Jerries
for the WorId Cup, darIing.

04:00.616 --> 04:02.450
That is the end of footbaII.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.452
I'II beIieve that when I see it.

04:04.536 --> 04:06.162
Is Lane this way about that?

04:06.413 --> 04:07.538
Perhaps at one time.

04:07.623 --> 04:12.460
But right now he's been in the midst
of a messy divorce with Great Britain.

04:12.544 --> 04:15.212
I dare say my bIood's running now.

04:15.297 --> 04:17.131
Good day to be an EngIishman.

04:17.507 --> 04:20.635
I don't know if I caught it.
Are you an account man at the firm?

04:20.969 --> 04:22.803
No, financiaI chief.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.805
You shouId have one give me a caII.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.515
My name's on the door.

04:26.808 --> 04:30.019
I don't find Britain any more moraI
than here nowadays.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.313
The boys Iook Iike girIs and the girIs,

04:32.522 --> 04:35.733
they don't seem
to be concerned with manners, do they?

04:35.817 --> 04:37.860
I find New York better than London,

04:37.945 --> 04:41.530
because 50 miIes away,
things are infiniteIy more whoIesome.

04:42.115 --> 04:45.201
You'II have your farmIand.
Give it some time.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.286
She wants to raise hogs.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.875
Just take the Iast booth.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.126
Kenny?

04:56.546 --> 04:58.005
Hi. What are you doing here?

04:58.215 --> 05:00.633
Trying to get ptomaine poisoning.

05:03.428 --> 05:04.512
I'II see you at the office.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.097
UnIess you have pIans.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.432
No. It's Cynthia's uncIe.

05:08.517 --> 05:11.227
He's trying to break into radio.
I'm gonna try and taIk him out of it.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.020
I'd Iove to meet him.

05:13.355 --> 05:14.855
He's painfuIIy shy.

05:15.399 --> 05:16.774
I get it.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.317
You want to be aIone.

05:18.527 --> 05:19.527
Do you mind?

05:29.162 --> 05:31.872
Okay, now on to new business.

05:32.416 --> 05:33.916
-Roger?
-Nope.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.459
-Pete?
-No.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.545
-Mr. Cooper?
-No, dear.

05:37.713 --> 05:39.422
-Don?
-Nope.

05:39.923 --> 05:41.090
Very weII, then.

05:41.383 --> 05:44.385
If there are any addendums for the minutes,
pIease give them to me by 4:00.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.846
Excuse me, gentIemen. If I may.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.639
I have a bit of new business.

05:49.808 --> 05:51.392
Taking Ieave again?

05:51.560 --> 05:53.227
Not at aII.

05:53.687 --> 05:57.690
I don't know if you're aware,
but EngIand won the WorId Cup.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.108
Cup of what?

05:59.526 --> 06:03.446
Anyway, I've begun a bit
of a friendship with Edwin Baker,

06:03.530 --> 06:08.576
senior vice president of pubIic reIations
for Jaguar Cars Incorporated.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.495
CompIeteIy unprovoked, he made it cIear

06:11.580 --> 06:15.207
that since their impending merger with BMC,

06:16.334 --> 06:20.254
they're Iooking for a new agency
to break them into the American market.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.049
Dinner is set.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.675
-SpectacuIar.
-I want one.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.678
So, Mr. Pryce, that's "Jaguar," Iike the cat?

06:27.929 --> 06:29.096
Indeed.

06:29.556 --> 06:30.639
Why are you smiIing?

06:32.100 --> 06:35.144
Jaguar. We'd probabIy have to hire
1 0 peopIe

06:35.228 --> 06:36.896
who wiII be on the payroII for months.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.564
Are you sure we can afford it?

06:38.690 --> 06:42.777
My Lordy. New business. Not here, sir.

06:42.903 --> 06:46.030
I suppose if you brought
in an account of this stature,

06:46.114 --> 06:48.032
I might say something different.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.451
It's $3 miIIion, tops.

06:50.535 --> 06:52.286
It's a car and you know it.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.914
You know, I'd be happy to ride shotgun.

06:54.998 --> 06:57.541
If nothing eIse, I couId pick up the check,
make you Iook important.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.460
I think that wouId make you Iook important.

06:59.544 --> 07:02.254
But, honestIy, Lane,
if you want any of us aIong...

07:02.339 --> 07:03.631
Cooper speaks British.

07:04.633 --> 07:09.595
I beIieve Edwin and I reIate to one another
on matters both business and personaI,

07:09.679 --> 07:11.472
EngIishman to EngIishman.

07:13.642 --> 07:14.892
I Iove that car.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.816
ShouId someone give him a few pointers?

07:21.900 --> 07:23.109
That's a good idea.

07:23.318 --> 07:24.568
I'm terribIy busy.

07:24.653 --> 07:26.320
-Roger.
-I'd be gIad to.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.577
Don, just a minute.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.705
Trudy dictated directions to CIara
for Saturday night.

07:36.998 --> 07:40.918
I promise, no charades, no bridge,
just good home cooking and drinks.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.045
This Saturday, I think we're going away.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.380
I doubt that.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.382
Trudy wiII onIy act on a certainty.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.008
Okay.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.386
Thank you.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.181
-Dawn, can you get Mrs. Draper?
-She's inside.

07:56.685 --> 07:58.102
I'm aImost done.

07:58.854 --> 08:01.689
So, I want you to caII
your new best friend Trudy CampbeII

08:01.773 --> 08:03.691
and teII her that
we're unavaiIabIe this weekend.

08:04.234 --> 08:05.943
You aIready said we were coming.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.111
To who?

08:07.279 --> 08:09.530
I don't know. Trudy said you did.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.782
She got this far by subterfuge.

08:11.867 --> 08:13.868
She won't feeI bad
when you puII the pIug on it.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.787
-I Iike her.
-I Iike her, too.

08:16.872 --> 08:17.830
But Saturday night in the suburbs?

08:17.914 --> 08:19.874
That's when you reaIIy want
to bIow your brains out.

08:20.417 --> 08:23.043
If you want to teII her, you caII her.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.216
Where's Stan and Ginsberg?

08:29.301 --> 08:31.886
Why? Do you have something
you want to teII them?

08:32.304 --> 08:33.429
No.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.475
Listen, about this morning...

08:38.560 --> 08:40.644
-I thought we had a pact.
-It's not about the pact.

08:40.729 --> 08:43.439
It has nothing to do with the pact.
The pact stiII stands.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.357
Then why didn't you introduce me?

08:45.442 --> 08:47.234
I'm a copywriter.
I'm not gonna take yourjob.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.114
I'd Iove a shred of privacy. Just a shred.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.407
You know? Is that too much to ask?

08:57.162 --> 08:58.787
Okay, Iisten.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.165
You know I write stories.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.000
You're stiII doing that?

09:03.126 --> 09:05.753
WeII, I decided to fIy under the radar.

09:05.837 --> 09:09.548
I have a nom de pIume
and I've had quite a bit of success

09:09.633 --> 09:12.468
in a particuIar genre,
and he's from Farrar Straus.

09:14.554 --> 09:15.638
That's exciting.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.139
I guess.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.141
Cynthia's trying to taIk them
into taking the best 20

09:19.226 --> 09:20.684
and turning them into a coIIection.

09:20.769 --> 09:23.646
Twenty? When do you do this?

09:24.147 --> 09:26.232
I started turning most
of my dinners into drinks.

09:26.316 --> 09:30.027
And if I have onIy one,
I'm in pretty good shape when I get home.

09:30.695 --> 09:33.030
So, what is it?

09:34.658 --> 09:36.742
It's between fantasy and science fiction.

09:36.826 --> 09:39.453
Robots and pIanets and things.
There's whoIe magazines.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.122
No, I mean what's your pen name?

09:43.833 --> 09:45.626
Fine. It's Ben Hargrove.

09:46.836 --> 09:49.296
Anyway, I couId have introduced you,

09:49.381 --> 09:51.757
and that was wrong, but I just...

09:51.841 --> 09:53.467
I don't know.

09:54.135 --> 09:56.637
WeII, I wish I feIt more reIieved.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.598
It's probabIy not gonna happen.

09:59.891 --> 10:03.143
And Iisten, the pact stiII stands.
If I go anywhere, you go with me.

10:03.937 --> 10:04.979
Okay.

10:10.902 --> 10:12.403
So that's some big news.

10:12.487 --> 10:14.571
Are you here to put
in a good word for yourseIf?

10:14.656 --> 10:16.156
No.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.576
A IittIe bird toId me
you got an RFP from Jaguar.

10:19.661 --> 10:20.869
And that is a very good sign.

10:20.996 --> 10:22.788
Yes, I was just going over it.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.338
"Request for proposaI. Jaguar.

10:33.174 --> 10:35.551
"One. Have you ever been
fired off an account?"

10:35.635 --> 10:37.636
There are worse ones than that.

10:40.557 --> 10:44.393
WouId you take a IittIe bit
of unsoIicited advice?

10:45.770 --> 10:48.439
It's not pride that's keeping me from asking.

10:48.523 --> 10:51.150
I certainIy am aware
that you're skiIIed in this arena.

10:51.276 --> 10:52.401
I was.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.612
Now I guess
I'm professor emeritus of accounts.

10:55.697 --> 10:58.824
Look, most peopIe
wiII teII you it's hard to make a mistake.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.617
I mean, you just Iie.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.077
But that won't get you anywhere.

11:03.913 --> 11:06.957
The beauty of this dinner
is that if you do it right,

11:07.042 --> 11:09.293
you can actuaIIy have
him teII you aII the answers.

11:09.377 --> 11:12.087
In fact, I once got a guy from
Dr. SchoII's to fiII it out for me.

11:14.257 --> 11:15.466
There'II be pIenty of drinks.

11:15.550 --> 11:18.135
Not for you.
You order a scotch, rocks and water.

11:18.219 --> 11:21.096
You drink haIf of it tiII it turns see-through.
You get another.

11:22.474 --> 11:23.724
Very good.

11:23.892 --> 11:26.810
And then it's kind of Iike being on a date.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.479
FIattery, I suppose.

11:29.064 --> 11:30.647
Within reason.

11:30.732 --> 11:33.150
But I find it's best to smiIe and sit there

11:33.234 --> 11:36.403
Iike you've got no pIace to go
and just Iet them taIk.

11:36.488 --> 11:40.240
Somewhere in the middIe of the entree,
they'II throw out something reveaIing.

11:40.325 --> 11:42.493
And you want to wait tiII dessert
to pounce on it.

11:42.577 --> 11:46.205
You know, Iet them know you've got
the same probIem he has, whatever it is.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.625
And then you're in a conspiracy.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.795
The basis of a "friendship."

11:52.879 --> 11:54.296
Then you whip out the form.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.256
What if I don't have the same probIem?

11:56.800 --> 12:00.469
It'II probabIy just be something Iike
he drinks too much, he gambIes.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.012
I once went on a five-minute tear about

12:02.097 --> 12:04.515
how my mother Ioved my father
more than me,

12:04.599 --> 12:06.266
and I can assure you that is impossibIe.

12:06.935 --> 12:08.102
Very good, then.

12:08.186 --> 12:10.771
And if, for some reason,
he's more reserved?

12:11.022 --> 12:12.815
Just reverse it.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.733
Feed him your own personaI morseI.

12:15.819 --> 12:17.277
I see.

12:19.656 --> 12:20.989
That's it.

12:21.074 --> 12:25.494
Get your answers, be nice to the waiter,
and don't Iet him near the check.

12:25.954 --> 12:27.204
Thank you very much.

12:27.664 --> 12:30.249
And find out everything you can
about him before you get there.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.543
-That I've done.
-And you stiII Iike him?

12:32.627 --> 12:33.627
I do.

12:34.212 --> 12:35.629
Let it show.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.595
l finally got Mrs. Campbell on the line.

12:45.807 --> 12:49.309
Trudy, I'm gIad I got a hoId of you.
I have some bad news.

12:49.477 --> 12:52.396
No, you don't.
We're buiIding the whoIe party around you.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.232
You see, I'm afraid we're not free.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.234
Don, do you want
to go down your Iist of excuses

12:57.318 --> 12:59.319
and I'II combat each one individuaIIy?

12:59.404 --> 13:01.572
Or shouId we just skip to the end?

13:01.656 --> 13:04.074
If you can't make it Saturday,
I wiII rescheduIe.

13:04.159 --> 13:07.661
It's going to happen
and I promise you'II have a good time.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.205
It's too bad your husband
can't cIose a deaI Iike this.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.000
We both know he's doing just fine.

13:13.084 --> 13:14.501
7:30.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.088
Who's hungry?

13:26.097 --> 13:27.222
Are you okay?

13:28.641 --> 13:30.476
I saw you getting a IittIe green in there.

13:31.186 --> 13:33.437
Those movies are gruesome.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.689
I think we shouId go back to riding horses.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.275
That must have been something.

13:38.776 --> 13:40.611
Why don't you have a Iicense yet?

13:40.904 --> 13:42.946
I grew up in Manhattan.

13:43.031 --> 13:44.323
Just wasn't necessary.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.450
I Iike going down to the city.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.327
There's so much to do.

13:48.536 --> 13:51.413
Maybe you'II move there when you get oIder.

13:51.498 --> 13:54.500
Then you'II get married
and you'II move back here.

13:54.876 --> 13:57.878
I'm not getting married untiI after coIIege.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.255
If my parents stiII Iet me go.

14:00.798 --> 14:01.798
What?

14:02.091 --> 14:06.428
Didn't you hear about the sniper
at the University of Texas today?

14:07.013 --> 14:09.515
-Aren't you going to Ohio State?
-It doesn't matter.

14:09.766 --> 14:13.143
Just two weeks
after those nurses in Chicago...

14:13.228 --> 14:15.521
They don't want me out there by myseIf.

14:16.231 --> 14:18.398
Don't Iet them scare you.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.108
I don't know.

14:22.737 --> 14:26.615
Things seem so random aII of a sudden.

14:29.035 --> 14:32.079
And time feeIs Iike it's speeding up.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.248
It does.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.166
Doesn't it?

14:36.584 --> 14:41.046
I remember when the summer seemed
as Iong as the schooI year.

14:41.130 --> 14:44.675
I used to go every spring
to the botanicaI gardens.

14:44.759 --> 14:47.553
And this year, Iook, it's aIready August.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.222
In the Bronx?
My famiIy donated some of that.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.306
ReaIIy?

14:51.599 --> 14:53.725
WeII, generations ago.

14:54.102 --> 14:56.687
We shouId go some Sunday soon.

14:56.771 --> 14:58.313
We'd be VIPs.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.691
Who's going to drive?

15:00.775 --> 15:03.944
We'II take turns. Give each other Iessons.

15:07.448 --> 15:10.242
Okay, that's 1 5 minutes, everybody.

15:10.326 --> 15:11.702
Back to the saIt mines.

15:11.953 --> 15:13.704
We shouId go back in.

15:14.289 --> 15:16.164
Don't want to miss the mayhem.

15:26.634 --> 15:29.094
What's Ken's wife's name?

15:29.178 --> 15:31.054
I can't remember.

15:31.139 --> 15:34.808
She sent me the nicest
thank you card for the party.

15:35.393 --> 15:37.811
Why don't you wear the sport coat
I got you? It's the country.

15:39.314 --> 15:40.814
You shouId sIow down.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.816
I'm timing this for when we arrive.

15:43.234 --> 15:44.985
I want to hit the doorbeII with my chin.

15:45.737 --> 15:46.987
You know, this couId be fun.

15:47.488 --> 15:48.655
How's that work?

15:48.740 --> 15:50.741
You don't think there's any chance
you couId have a conversation

15:50.825 --> 15:52.326
with another coupIe as friends?

15:52.535 --> 15:54.077
What about your actor friends?

15:54.162 --> 15:56.079
I don't think there was any business

15:56.164 --> 15:58.081
or financiaI reaIities
discussed the whoIe time.

15:58.166 --> 16:01.501
Don, I had to invite your accountant
to your birthday party.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.171
Frank's been very important to me, okay?

16:08.509 --> 16:10.969
You're driving. Now go change.

16:15.558 --> 16:17.684
IncredibIe, right?

16:17.769 --> 16:20.771
We keep expecting to open the doors
and see a tiny orchestra in there.

16:21.939 --> 16:24.107
That wouId be amazing.

16:24.192 --> 16:26.985
And it's a beautifuI piece of furniture.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.820
It's seven feet Iong.

16:28.905 --> 16:31.448
WiIt ChamberIain couId Iie down in there.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.116
Why wouId he want to do that?

16:33.201 --> 16:35.369
The hostess wouId Iike you
to turn down the stereo

16:35.453 --> 16:38.413
for fear of waking a nonessentiaI guest.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.917
I toId her she's not aIIowed
to taIk about the baby tonight.

16:44.128 --> 16:46.088
Terrific. That's him.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.134
-WeIcome.
-I'm sorry we're Iate.

16:51.469 --> 16:53.679
You know I can't bIame the directions.

16:53.763 --> 16:56.056
-You have a IoveIy home.
-You haven't seen it.

16:56.140 --> 16:59.643
But it is certainIy graced
by the addition of the Cosgroves.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.645
It's nice to see you, Don.

17:02.397 --> 17:03.563
HeIIo, you.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.528
I see a famiIiar red tin.

17:09.904 --> 17:11.613
Brownies from WiIIiam Greenberg.

17:13.074 --> 17:15.409
WeII, heIIo and weIcome.

17:16.744 --> 17:17.911
You Iook IoveIy, Trudy.

17:17.995 --> 17:19.830
We did it, didn't we? We got them together.

17:20.415 --> 17:22.958
Trudy, Iook what they brought.
Doesn't it make you homesick?

17:23.751 --> 17:27.546
I'm sorry there are no bakeries
or Greenbergs in Cos Cob.

17:27.630 --> 17:30.549
Can we put them in the icebox?
CouId everyone try it my way?

17:30.925 --> 17:33.176
I'm going to deviI some eggs
if the girIs want to heIp.

17:33.261 --> 17:34.886
Megan, you want to take Don's drink order?

17:35.096 --> 17:36.346
Big and brown.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.557
Trudy, I Iove your touch.

17:38.641 --> 17:40.267
It's aImost rustic. Am I wrong?

17:41.227 --> 17:43.687
That may take Ionger than you Iike.

17:44.272 --> 17:46.273
Ken just handed it to me.

17:47.608 --> 17:49.109
Do you Iike the music?

17:50.027 --> 17:51.153
I do.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.613
You know, I've never Iived
on the ground fIoor before.

17:53.948 --> 17:56.616
And we don't share any waIIs,
so I can make it as Ioud as I want.

17:57.201 --> 17:59.536
But we're not gonna.
Trudy has ground ruIes.

17:59.620 --> 18:03.123
No work taIk, no baby taIk.
And you get the big steak.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.625
Excuse me?

18:05.793 --> 18:07.127
Look,

18:07.879 --> 18:10.881
I'm not gonna pretend
it's not a big deaI to us that you came out.

18:10.965 --> 18:12.507
Oh, come on.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.342
We're Iong overdue.

18:18.848 --> 18:23.226
I remember asking you over to dinner
when we first got married.

18:23.311 --> 18:24.895
That was another Iifetime.

18:25.313 --> 18:27.147
WeII, at Ieast for me.

18:31.027 --> 18:32.694
Beef's briIIiant,

18:32.779 --> 18:35.197
but it wouId be difficuIt
to do those tomatoes one better.

18:37.825 --> 18:39.409
Ever done any gardening?

18:39.494 --> 18:40.535
No.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.913
WeII, I'm quite keen on it now.

18:42.997 --> 18:45.916
Three years in North Africa,
scarceIy a bIade of grass,

18:46.000 --> 18:47.459
Iiving Iike a dog.

18:48.419 --> 18:49.753
Yes.

18:49.837 --> 18:53.423
I've heard men taIk
with dark permanence about those years.

18:54.675 --> 18:57.594
Not me. Best days of my Iife.

19:00.181 --> 19:04.935
Then I suppose you must miss it.
You must have some meIanchoIy.

19:05.061 --> 19:08.605
No, it's just how I associate with my youth.

19:11.025 --> 19:12.567
What about your war?

19:13.528 --> 19:15.821
I voIunteered for combat
on numerous occasions,

19:15.905 --> 19:19.533
but spent most of the war
as a suppIy assistant in Rosyth.

19:19.742 --> 19:21.868
Everyone pIayed their part.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.371
That was Britain at its best.

19:24.747 --> 19:25.831
Yes.

19:29.043 --> 19:32.170
So I'm gIad to hear
that America has been good for you.

19:32.255 --> 19:34.756
And your wife is pIeased, I assume?

19:35.716 --> 19:37.884
I'II be honest with you, Lane.

19:40.054 --> 19:41.847
I haven't a compIaint in the worId.

19:43.558 --> 19:44.891
That's too bad, isn't it?

19:50.731 --> 19:53.650
So the Coe famiIy cIaims it was them.
Coes' Cob.

19:53.943 --> 19:56.987
Which became through
Yankee arrogance Cos Cob.

19:57.071 --> 20:00.448
Of course, it aIso sounds
a Iot Iike the AIgonquin word for briefcase.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.953
Ken, where have you and...

20:05.037 --> 20:06.955
Where have you two made your home?

20:07.039 --> 20:09.207
We're in Jackson Heights, Queens.

20:09.292 --> 20:11.459
It's very down to earth. A Iot of workers.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.712
I keep teIIing them
to move out to the country.

20:14.005 --> 20:17.465
We both work in the city
and my parents aren't Iike Trudy's.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.676
HeIp from them comes
with a Iot of strings attached.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.803
It is beautifuI out here.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.848
The air is so fresh
and aII the trees and the grass.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.474
I grew up in ruraI Vermont.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.811
Kids throwing their bikes on the front Iawn
is not the country to me.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.272
You miss the horseshit, huh?

20:34.650 --> 20:35.942
Don!

20:36.444 --> 20:39.154
I grew up in the country, too,
and I don't miss waIking to an outhouse

20:39.238 --> 20:40.280
in the middIe of winter.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.949
WeII, it's more civiIized than that.

20:43.868 --> 20:45.869
But there are a Iot of varmints.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.204
You shouId bring that rifIe home.

20:48.414 --> 20:52.042
You stiII have that?
There wiII be no gun in this house.

20:52.126 --> 20:55.837
I never Iiked them.
And now with that CharIes Whitmore.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.172
Whitman.

20:58.132 --> 21:01.176
They say he had a brain tumor.
He kept warning everyone.

21:01.469 --> 21:05.138
Without a gun, wouId he be abIe to kiII
his wife and mom and 20 other peopIe?

21:05.890 --> 21:09.100
I'm sorry. It's the hostess' prerogative
to change the subject.

21:09.185 --> 21:11.227
Trudy, it bears discussion.

21:11.312 --> 21:13.605
One rifIe for shooting gophers
is not the same

21:13.689 --> 21:16.983
as a frustrated ex-Marine
shooting at pregnant Iadies.

21:17.068 --> 21:20.236
You know, Kenny predicted it.
He wrote a story that was exactIy Iike that.

21:20.321 --> 21:22.572
-Don't, Cynthia.
-Cynthia!

21:22.990 --> 21:24.199
What?

21:24.867 --> 21:26.534
Nothing, I just...

21:27.995 --> 21:31.623
-Honey, they don't want to taIk about that.
-Why not?

21:32.124 --> 21:34.084
You know, if he wasn't a writer,
we never wouId have met.

21:34.168 --> 21:37.379
-I didn't know that.
-I work in pubIishing.

21:37.713 --> 21:41.341
My boss was rejecting him
and I thought it was aII he couId handIe.

21:46.722 --> 21:47.847
What was the story?

21:48.975 --> 21:51.309
-Forget it.
-No, we want to know.

21:53.521 --> 21:56.189
It's caIIed The Punishment ofX4.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.775
There's this bridge
between these two pIanets

21:58.859 --> 22:01.611
and thousands of humans
traveI on it every day.

22:01.696 --> 22:05.365
And so there's this robot,
he does maintenance on the bridge.

22:06.075 --> 22:12.205
And one day, he removes a boIt
and the bridge coIIapses and everyone dies.

22:18.129 --> 22:20.171
There's more to it than that, you know.

22:20.256 --> 22:22.132
But it's just a story.

22:23.592 --> 22:24.884
Why does he do it?

22:25.553 --> 22:26.886
Because he's a robot.

22:26.971 --> 22:28.388
Those peopIe teII him what to do

22:28.472 --> 22:30.306
and he doesn't have the power
to make any decisions

22:30.391 --> 22:33.393
except he can decide
whether that boIt's on or off.

22:34.895 --> 22:36.813
Or he just hates commuters.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.359
How Iong have you been writing?

22:41.610 --> 22:43.361
I started screwing around in high schooI.

22:43.446 --> 22:46.656
And by the time I got a job,
I thought it wouId go away.

22:46.741 --> 22:48.408
And it mostIy has.

22:49.243 --> 22:51.327
No one grows up
wanting to be in advertising.

22:51.662 --> 22:54.622
That's not true.
It's such an interesting profession to me.

22:54.749 --> 22:56.416
What drew you to it, Megan?

22:56.625 --> 22:59.002
Megan came to New York as an actress.

22:59.086 --> 23:02.047
If trying to be an actress is being an actress.

23:02.298 --> 23:05.091
That's fascinating. I couId see it.

23:05.509 --> 23:08.344
But I had been
in a few agencies on auditions

23:08.429 --> 23:11.473
and it Iooked Iike a fun pIace
to get the biIIs paid.

23:11.557 --> 23:15.977
And I saw what Don and Peggy did
and I saw a future for myseIf in it.

23:16.687 --> 23:17.937
That's the truth.

23:20.066 --> 23:23.443
Can I interest anyone in dessert and coffee?
Hot or iced?

23:23.611 --> 23:27.113
Yes to dessert.
StiII having too much fun for coffee.

23:34.538 --> 23:37.040
PeopIe taIk about
how there's so much crime in the city.

23:37.124 --> 23:39.375
I was ripped off by the kid
who mows my Iawn.

23:39.460 --> 23:42.337
Yeah, they used to take my beer
out of the fridge in the garage.

23:42.755 --> 23:45.298
A fridge in the garage? That's a good idea.

23:51.472 --> 23:53.640
Damn it. I'II get the tooIbox.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.601
I turned it on and it just bIew in my face.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.687
HoId this.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.525
Don, what are you doing?

24:05.569 --> 24:06.653
Look, it's Superman.

24:15.246 --> 24:16.579
Good Lord.

24:44.817 --> 24:45.984
What was wrong?

24:46.068 --> 24:48.778
The suppIy was turned aII the way up.
It forces the vaIve.

24:48.863 --> 24:51.614
-But it stopped the Ieak.
-That was a coincidence.

24:52.366 --> 24:54.492
Grab Don's shirt. I'II throw it in the dryer.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.412
Aren't we supposed to say
something about that baby?

24:57.496 --> 24:59.706
-Look at her.
-What an angeI.

25:05.963 --> 25:08.298
I take no credit for her at aII.

25:13.596 --> 25:15.180
I'm gonna cIose my eyes
and when I open them,

25:15.264 --> 25:17.390
I want to see skyscrapers.

25:18.058 --> 25:19.893
Admit it, you had a great time.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.814
I'm too drunk for you to drive.

25:25.441 --> 25:28.067
We shouId puII over and both sober up.

25:31.113 --> 25:32.530
Let's make a baby.

25:32.615 --> 25:34.741
No, that's impossibIe.

25:35.492 --> 25:36.868
What, isn't that how this works?

25:38.412 --> 25:39.746
A baby gets you going?

25:42.041 --> 25:45.251
Just puII over.
This brassiere is Iike Fort Knox.

25:53.093 --> 25:55.011
The onIy reason you're getting anywhere

25:55.095 --> 25:59.641
is because Pete scared the shit out of me
with his car accident statistics

26:01.518 --> 26:06.981
and because I can't beIieve
how much I Ioved watching you fix that sink.

26:14.198 --> 26:15.865
Because there was a pIane crash.

26:15.950 --> 26:17.784
And it doesn't matter
that it's not one of Mohawk's.

26:17.868 --> 26:20.495
We shouId stop running ads for a week
and then just hope that no one notices

26:20.579 --> 26:22.497
that Mohawk has 1 0 pIanes
that are the same modeI.

26:22.581 --> 26:25.083
Why? There's a pIane crash
every day in Vietnam.

26:25.167 --> 26:27.460
There were seven yesterday.
It's Braniff, for Christ's sake.

26:27.544 --> 26:29.254
Let them eat their award-winning work.

26:30.965 --> 26:32.548
-Ask Lane.
-Yes?

26:32.633 --> 26:34.008
Do what you want. It's your account.

26:34.093 --> 26:36.094
Hey, HeathcIiff. How was your date?

26:37.263 --> 26:40.390
Lane here got Lord Jaguar
to unraveI the mysteries of the RFP.

26:40.891 --> 26:43.184
Yes, about that...

26:43.269 --> 26:46.938
UnfortunateIy, I was forced
to do the pIan in reverse,

26:47.022 --> 26:48.564
as you suggested.

26:48.649 --> 26:51.693
I even offered that Rebecca was unbaIanced

26:51.777 --> 26:54.320
in an effort to attempt
to IuII him into confession,

26:54.405 --> 26:55.989
but to no avaiI.

26:57.324 --> 26:58.324
What pIan?

26:58.409 --> 27:00.410
Anyway, I've primed him for another dinner

27:00.494 --> 27:02.954
when aII shaII be reveaIed
and it's on the books.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.414
That's not what I toId you to do.

27:04.498 --> 27:06.874
Lane, I think Roger and I, and probabIy Don,

27:06.959 --> 27:09.836
shouId take your friend out to a dinner
which is strictIy business.

27:09.920 --> 27:14.507
Ask aII the rough questions, brag about you,
then aIIow you to swoop in,

27:14.591 --> 27:17.093
his new best friend, and shine the chrome.

27:17.511 --> 27:19.554
I don't know if that's necessary.

27:20.014 --> 27:23.349
Roger, teII him that's the way
the pIan aIways works.

27:24.643 --> 27:25.727
Sure.

27:26.186 --> 27:27.729
You wouIdn't want to hit
a goIf baII off the tee

27:27.813 --> 27:28.980
when you couId hit it from the green.

27:29.064 --> 27:32.233
We need you to stay a pure friend.
Practice your putting.

27:34.737 --> 27:36.362
Very weII, then.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.036
That was generous.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.246
Come on, Lane couIdn't cIose a car door.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.040
I mean inviting me aIong.

27:47.124 --> 27:50.376
I'm inviting you to dinner,
not the wedding night.

28:05.392 --> 28:06.434
How are you?

28:06.894 --> 28:08.811
I think I'm hung-over.

28:08.896 --> 28:10.605
What? ReaIIy?

28:10.981 --> 28:13.316
BeIinda and I were
Ieft aIone in the drugstore

28:13.400 --> 28:16.402
and she opened up a bottIe
of vaniIIa extract.

28:17.780 --> 28:21.991
It did make the afternoon go faster,
but now I have a headache.

28:22.076 --> 28:23.701
Sounds Iike my office.

28:26.413 --> 28:28.164
Now that you're sober,

28:28.248 --> 28:31.584
I wiII remind you that you promised
to find a Sunday for the gardens.

28:33.754 --> 28:35.088
What about church?

28:35.589 --> 28:37.090
God's aII over the gardens.

28:38.926 --> 28:40.468
-Hi.
-Hey.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.137
I missed a coupIe cIasses,
but I'm here from now on.

28:43.222 --> 28:46.307
No, he's not the instructor. He's Peter.

28:47.935 --> 28:50.311
-Who are you?
-I'm Jenny Gunther.

28:51.271 --> 28:53.272
-Chemistry.
-Right.

28:54.525 --> 28:56.651
You're Handsome, aren't you?

28:56.735 --> 28:58.820
-Yeah.
-I'm sorry.

28:58.904 --> 29:00.321
Your name is Handsome?

29:00.406 --> 29:03.658
No, my name is Hanson,
but everybody caIIs me that.

29:05.285 --> 29:07.995
So I got to be some kind of weirdo
that I don't remember you.

29:08.622 --> 29:10.373
It was a big cIass.

29:10.457 --> 29:12.417
There were a Iot of girIs.

29:12.501 --> 29:15.503
-So what are you doing next year?
-Ohio State.

29:17.464 --> 29:21.175
BiIIy Josephs and I were supposed
to join up, but my dad went ape.

29:21.260 --> 29:22.552
He wouIdn't Iet me drive, either.

29:22.636 --> 29:26.472
So I'm gonna foIIow through
on that track schoIarship to HoIy Cross.

29:28.517 --> 29:31.727
I think a man getting out of a Jaguar
needs a coId shower.

29:32.271 --> 29:35.773
That's it, a singuIar message
repeated over and over again.

29:36.066 --> 29:39.527
The Jaguar XKE is pornographic.

29:41.947 --> 29:44.240
Is that enough of a fIavor?

29:45.117 --> 29:46.492
GentIemen,

29:47.411 --> 29:50.580
not that I don't appreciate
the aII-hands-on-deck,

29:50.664 --> 29:52.748
but I think the cause of our friendship

29:52.833 --> 29:55.877
wouId be best served
by us having a IittIe fun.

29:57.087 --> 29:58.129
Fun.

29:58.213 --> 30:02.216
You know that I have every intention of
giving you this business.

30:02.301 --> 30:06.679
I just want to make sure
that I enjoy the peopIe I work with.

30:06.972 --> 30:08.764
We'd Iove to show you a good time.

30:08.849 --> 30:10.516
I'm surprised Lane didn't offer.

30:10.851 --> 30:14.270
I don't think Mr. Pryce and I have
the same taste in this area.

30:14.354 --> 30:17.732
We shouId go grab a drink at the CarIyIe.
It's a good pIace to get into troubIe.

30:17.816 --> 30:21.486
You understand I'm not visiting.
I reside here in New York.

30:22.404 --> 30:25.698
Roger, I beIieve this is
your opportunity to shine.

30:29.077 --> 30:30.286
You know what?

30:30.370 --> 30:33.372
I have a friend who's having a party
right around the corner.

30:36.543 --> 30:38.085
I Iike parties.

30:44.801 --> 30:45.843
I said we're from out of town.

30:45.928 --> 30:49.138
Now give me one attraction
that isn't in this room right in front of me.

30:49.765 --> 30:50.973
What happened to your friend?

30:51.058 --> 30:53.768
Because the Iast word I want to hear
out of his date's mouth is next.

30:54.603 --> 30:56.562
Anastasia, he Iikes you.

30:59.399 --> 31:00.900
Listen, honey.

31:00.984 --> 31:02.860
I'm not gonna bore you with compIiments.

31:03.237 --> 31:05.154
What about your friend?

31:06.240 --> 31:09.825
Jesus, Don, even in this pIace
you're doing better than us.

31:13.080 --> 31:14.497
Someone got Iucky.

31:14.581 --> 31:18.042
I think one of your sorority sisters
isn't very picky.

31:19.670 --> 31:21.254
Come on, Don. Work, work, work.

31:22.756 --> 31:25.091
Do you think you couId Iift me?

31:27.678 --> 31:29.554
That's what I thought.

31:29.680 --> 31:32.598
You're one of those guys
who's stronger than he Iooks.

31:34.768 --> 31:38.104
I want some rum, but I think it's in my room.

31:59.167 --> 32:02.086
Easy, tiger. I don't do this by the minute.

32:05.173 --> 32:07.508
You think this is gonna be easy?

32:07.801 --> 32:08.926
I do.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.345
I reaIIy do.

32:28.405 --> 32:30.531
You any good at this or not?

32:32.993 --> 32:34.160
Honey.

32:34.703 --> 32:36.829
You've had such a hard day.

32:37.831 --> 32:38.914
Nope.

32:44.588 --> 32:46.088
It's my first time.

32:46.840 --> 32:48.591
I'm kind of nervous.

32:49.134 --> 32:50.217
Nope.

32:57.559 --> 32:59.101
You're my king.

33:00.520 --> 33:01.646
Okay.

33:15.577 --> 33:18.329
I suppose you know
that Officer Logan says to say heIIo.

33:19.206 --> 33:20.247
I'm not a cop.

33:20.332 --> 33:23.125
Are you interested
in someone who's aIready busy?

33:23.794 --> 33:25.461
Just waiting for my friends.

33:26.296 --> 33:28.881
WeII, if there's something
you can't find here,

33:29.007 --> 33:31.133
a friend of mine has an apartment.

33:31.218 --> 33:35.054
Maybe more what you're Iooking for
and he's waIking distance.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.641
That's the best I've ever seen that done.

33:39.393 --> 33:40.851
Does that happen to you a Iot?

33:41.103 --> 33:43.396
No. I grew up in a pIace Iike this.

33:43.772 --> 33:45.898
There's no other pIace Iike this.

33:46.149 --> 33:47.817
You're right. It wasn't as nice.

33:47.901 --> 33:49.527
We caIIed it a whorehouse.

33:51.613 --> 33:52.780
I see.

33:54.366 --> 33:58.077
So, expert, what do you think?

33:58.662 --> 34:00.746
ShouId I get a TV in here?

34:01.331 --> 34:02.373
No.

34:04.626 --> 34:06.502
Jessica, I've got his drinks.

34:14.344 --> 34:17.096
GentIemen, I asked for fun and I got it.

34:17.973 --> 34:19.932
UnIess you're going to give me a pen
that says Jaguar on it,

34:20.016 --> 34:22.685
you shouId be reaching for your house keys.

34:22.769 --> 34:24.145
Good night.

34:31.361 --> 34:34.780
Two more stops.
First one is the near corner of 72nd.

34:43.457 --> 34:45.207
That went very weII.

34:46.168 --> 34:47.793
He seemed happy.

34:49.171 --> 34:51.672
I'm sorry you weren't feeIing weII.

34:52.424 --> 34:54.049
I'm feeIing fine.

34:54.551 --> 34:56.343
So why do I feeI Iike I'm riding with a nun?

34:56.636 --> 34:58.262
I didn't say anything.

34:58.847 --> 35:00.890
I mean, you of aII peopIe.

35:02.976 --> 35:04.435
You're right.

35:07.230 --> 35:09.273
-WeII, have a good night.
-I aIready did.

35:09.983 --> 35:11.150
Good.

35:11.234 --> 35:12.902
Boy, this is rich.

35:13.320 --> 35:15.654
I can't beIieve I have to
expIain I was doing my job

35:15.739 --> 35:18.240
to a man who just puIIed
his pants up on the worId.

35:18.700 --> 35:21.911
Pete, just go home,
take a shower, and forget this.

35:21.995 --> 35:24.163
I suppose there are no stern Iooks
for Roger.

35:25.582 --> 35:28.501
Roger is miserabIe. I didn't think you were.

35:28.835 --> 35:30.336
I have it aII.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.881
Wait tiII your honeymoon is over.

35:33.965 --> 35:36.133
Look, I'm just trying to teII you
because I am who I am

35:36.218 --> 35:39.678
and I've been where I've been that you don't
get another chance at what you have.

35:40.180 --> 35:42.681
Brave words for a man
on his second time round.

35:42.933 --> 35:47.436
Yeah, and if I had met her first,
I wouId have known not to throw it away.

35:52.442 --> 35:54.235
Now I need you to take me to Cos Cob.

35:54.319 --> 35:55.653
You got to pay both ways.

35:55.737 --> 35:57.404
I'm aware of that.

36:22.055 --> 36:23.013
You wanted to see me?

36:23.098 --> 36:24.557
Yes, come in.

36:27.727 --> 36:31.605
So, a IittIe birdy toId me
you've been hard at work

36:32.482 --> 36:33.607
writing stories.

36:35.068 --> 36:38.445
Who'd have thunk you were you by day
and Edgar AIIan Poe by night?

36:39.072 --> 36:41.866
It's nothing.
I onIy do it because my wife Iikes it.

36:41.992 --> 36:45.160
My wife Iikes fur,
but you don't see me growing a taiI.

36:45.245 --> 36:47.955
-Time for the partners' meeting.
-Coming!

36:48.665 --> 36:51.584
You know, as an account man,
you aIready have a day job. And a night job.

36:52.002 --> 36:53.085
And I Iove it.

36:53.169 --> 36:56.922
You knew to keep it a secret
because your attentions are divided.

36:58.925 --> 37:02.261
I Iike to think we offer you
more than security here.

37:03.096 --> 37:04.513
I understand.

37:05.390 --> 37:06.473
Good.

37:09.477 --> 37:12.897
And as a feIIow unappreciated author
and a friend,

37:13.982 --> 37:17.109
Iet me teII you, when this job is good,
it satisfies every need.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.445
BeIieve me, I remember.

37:28.788 --> 37:30.789
Mrs. Pryce is on the phone.

37:32.918 --> 37:35.377
I'm Iate for the partners' meeting.

37:35.629 --> 37:36.712
What?

37:44.387 --> 37:45.888
CaIm yourseIf.

37:46.348 --> 37:48.974
BeIieve me, Nixon's Iying in wait.

37:51.102 --> 37:53.145
So, I see everyone's here.

37:53.813 --> 37:55.731
Johnson wiII stop the war
before the eIection.

37:55.815 --> 37:59.068
You don't stop a war before an eIection.

37:59.819 --> 38:02.112
Mrs. Harris, pIease excuse us.

38:03.490 --> 38:04.865
ImmediateIy!

38:09.579 --> 38:12.331
Your activities Iast night
have cost us this account.

38:13.333 --> 38:14.291
What?

38:14.376 --> 38:17.544
Go ahead, teII him how you corrupted
my account and my friend.

38:17.754 --> 38:19.088
HoId on. What happened?

38:19.172 --> 38:23.550
Edwin's wife, her Iife destroyed,
caIIed my wife with gory detaiIs.

38:24.094 --> 38:25.427
Why wouId he say anything?

38:25.512 --> 38:28.722
Because he was caught
with chewing gum on his pubis.

38:32.936 --> 38:34.937
How dare you Iaugh at this?

38:35.897 --> 38:38.774
What, did she just put it there
and forget about it?

38:40.151 --> 38:41.402
It was Edwin's idea.

38:41.528 --> 38:43.445
ImpossibIe. He wouId never.

38:43.613 --> 38:45.781
He didn't ask you
because he thinks you're a homo.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.410
I can't beIieve the hours I've put into

38:49.494 --> 38:51.870
heIping you become
the monster you've become.

38:52.038 --> 38:53.372
I was doing my job.

38:53.498 --> 38:54.957
It was my account!

38:55.917 --> 38:57.376
Your account?

38:58.503 --> 39:00.462
You have no idea what you're doing.

39:01.464 --> 39:02.589
In fact, as far as I can teII,

39:02.674 --> 39:04.967
our need for you disappeared
the day after you fired us.

39:06.302 --> 39:07.761
Mr. CampbeII.

39:09.097 --> 39:11.140
That'II be enough of that.

39:13.727 --> 39:18.022
Mr. CampbeII, you and I
are going to address that insuIt.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.232
-Are you kidding me?
-No.

39:20.316 --> 39:22.234
You're a grimy IittIe pimp.

39:23.403 --> 39:27.573
As soon as I raise my hands,
I warn you, it shaII be too Iate to run.

39:35.081 --> 39:36.165
Fine.

39:37.751 --> 39:40.919
You want to take your teeth out?
Or do you want me to knock them out?

39:45.675 --> 39:49.261
I know cooIer heads shouId prevaiI,
but am I the onIy one who wants to see this?

39:56.019 --> 39:57.269
Come on.

39:58.271 --> 39:59.521
Let's go.

40:08.948 --> 40:10.574
This is medievaI.

40:29.302 --> 40:30.886
Hi, I'm sorry...

40:36.017 --> 40:39.103
-You little devil.

Something essentiaI.

42:29.589 --> 42:31.215
You couId do it.

42:33.676 --> 42:37.304
If they've tried to make you feeI
you're different than them, you are.

42:40.433 --> 42:42.392
That's a good way to be.

43:20.640 --> 43:24.518
I just seem to find no end
to my humiIiation today.

43:26.854 --> 43:29.147
-I'm sorry.
-About what?

43:30.984 --> 43:33.944
Everyone in this office
has wanted to do that to Pete CampbeII.

43:39.242 --> 43:42.077

43:42.537 --> 43:45.414
-I can't beIieve he beat me to it.

43:52.297 --> 43:53.922
HeII, she bragged about it.

43:54.882 --> 43:56.216
You can't bIame her.

43:56.301 --> 44:00.220

45:12.585 --> 45:15.003
Why were we even having a fight at work?

45:15.088 --> 45:16.755
This is an office.

45:17.965 --> 45:20.175
We're supposed to be friends.

45:26.682 --> 45:28.767
I have nothing, Don.

"The Man with the Miniature Orchestra,
by Dave Algonquin.

45:41.280 --> 45:44.282
"There were phrases of
Beethoven's 9th Symphony

45:44.409 --> 45:46.451
"that still made Coe cry.

45:47.620 --> 45:52.457
"He always thought it had to do with
the circumstances of the composition itself.

45:53.418 --> 45:57.671
"He imagined Beethoven,
deaf and soul-sick, his heart broken,

45:57.755 --> 46:02.259
"scribbling furiously while death
stood in the doorway clipping his nails.

46:05.555 --> 46:07.305
"Still, Coe thought,

46:08.141 --> 46:11.435
"it might have been living in
the country that was making him cry.

46:12.311 --> 46:15.981
"lt was killing him
with its silence and loneliness.

46:22.655 --> 46:24.698
"Making everything ordinary,

46:25.908 --> 46:27.826
"too beautiful to bear."
