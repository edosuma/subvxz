WEBVTT

00:01.202 --> 00:06.271
(liquid splashing)
(dramatic music)

00:08.943 --> 00:09.675
(glasses clinking)

00:12.980 --> 00:20.185
¶ Bury me not on
the lone prairie ¶

00:20.855 --> 00:23.655
(dramatic music)

00:41.709 --> 00:44.109
(ax whacks)

00:57.324 --> 00:58.590
- Good mornin' to y'all.

01:00.261 --> 01:01.326
- And to you, ma'am.

01:02.430 --> 01:03.462
Beggin' a pardon
for the imposition

01:03.464 --> 01:04.263
but a few words
need speakin' on.

01:11.439 --> 01:13.906
- Won't you come inside then?

01:18.946 --> 01:20.779
(spits)

01:20.781 --> 01:22.548
You'll have to forgive us,

01:22.550 --> 01:24.516
we're not used to
seeing folks out here.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.196
Is the water to your likin'?

01:38.466 --> 01:40.899
- Very much so, thank you.

01:40.901 --> 01:43.936
- Yeah, well, it's
the darnedest thing,

01:43.938 --> 01:45.904
the well out there's
all full of sulfur

01:45.906 --> 01:48.307
but ya set a pitcher of it
out in the sun for an hour

01:48.309 --> 01:50.109
and it seems to fix it right up.

01:51.679 --> 01:54.046
- Word had it it was
just the two of you.

01:54.048 --> 01:57.182
- Our daughter, Ruth.

01:57.184 --> 02:00.185
- How you manage to
maintain yourself.

02:04.959 --> 02:06.525
My apology, ma'am.

02:08.762 --> 02:11.130
Quite a nice piece of
land you have here.

02:12.299 --> 02:16.268
Secluded, a little isolated.

02:18.472 --> 02:21.273
- Well, we make do, don't we?

02:23.277 --> 02:27.713
- Still, man's a complicated
and fickle creature.

02:29.216 --> 02:30.716
Once he grows accustomed
to having something,

02:30.718 --> 02:33.585
it's hard to learn
how to do without.

02:34.955 --> 02:38.590
Simple things, the slightest
diversions of convenience

02:38.592 --> 02:40.893
gives him a sense of reprieve.

02:42.296 --> 02:45.497
Now myself, I find that
paramount to our existence.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.398
- Amen to that.

02:52.006 --> 02:55.007
- (sighs) I spent most
of my life on the trail,

02:55.009 --> 02:57.142
far from the amenities
of the gentrified,

02:58.979 --> 03:03.549
a fresh cigar, a
smooth shot of whiskey,

03:04.952 --> 03:08.854
or the warmth found between
the thighs of a fine woman.

03:11.959 --> 03:12.891
At least with that last one,

03:12.893 --> 03:14.426
you're not having to do without.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.199
Are you, Isaac?

03:21.268 --> 03:22.367
- Name's Meechum.

03:24.038 --> 03:25.470
James Meechum.

03:25.472 --> 03:26.772
- Well, forgive my error.

03:28.342 --> 03:30.342
I was told that this
was the homestead

03:30.344 --> 03:33.378
of Mr. Isaac Ackerman.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.416
Six of 12 and
foreman in the trial

03:37.418 --> 03:39.284
of a man by the
name of Jake Tullis?

03:41.288 --> 03:43.522
The word is that Mr. Ackerman
and his fellow weren't content

03:43.524 --> 03:46.625
to simply snatch the
life from old Jake

03:46.627 --> 03:48.560
but left him on a
rope past sundown.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.800
Left him there for the
better part of a month.

03:56.136 --> 03:58.337
So birds picked out
his eyes from his skull

03:58.339 --> 04:00.239
and the flesh off his bones.

04:01.175 --> 04:02.608
- Go tend to your chores, Ruth.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.042
- Do no such thing.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.213
I regret this not being a tale

04:08.215 --> 04:10.382
such innocent ears should hear.

04:10.384 --> 04:11.316
- If I may--

04:11.318 --> 04:14.219
- Now, Tullis was no angel.

04:16.123 --> 04:17.122
That much is true.

04:19.226 --> 04:22.127
But whatever could he have
done to warrant such cruelty?

04:23.664 --> 04:28.166
And at the hands of such
fine and upstanding people?

04:30.137 --> 04:31.870
I've asked this question of many

04:31.872 --> 04:35.173
and still have yet to get
an answer that satisfies.

04:37.411 --> 04:41.613
So I inquire to
you, Mr. Ackerman,

04:44.184 --> 04:46.018
what great cruelty
befell those good people

04:46.020 --> 04:49.054
that would cause them
to behave in such a way?

04:49.056 --> 04:50.522
- This turn out any different

04:50.524 --> 04:53.625
if I spin you some fancy words?

04:53.627 --> 04:54.493
- Good man.

04:57.031 --> 04:58.864
Hard and steady to the last.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.068
Can't say the same
for any of the others.

05:05.339 --> 05:06.838
But it's only fitting,

05:06.840 --> 05:09.608
seeing as how you're the final
notch to carve in the iron.

05:12.179 --> 05:13.245
Last of 12.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.084
Oh, I figured you heard.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.654
But maybe you hadn't, seeing
as how far you were in.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.493
But just to move things along,

05:29.930 --> 05:31.129
I find you guilty.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.001
(Ruth gasps)

05:36.003 --> 05:36.902
- Mama!

05:38.572 --> 05:40.172
- Let her go, please.

05:45.346 --> 05:46.328
Please.

05:46.329 --> 05:47.311
- Oh, it's a precious
thing to behold.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.882
The love a father
has for his child.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.052
Nothing runs so thick as blood.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.154
(Ruth crying)

05:56.156 --> 05:58.190
Were you there that
day, Mrs. Ackerman?

05:59.793 --> 06:01.727
Imagine you're proud
of your husband.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.262
- I beg you, please.

06:04.264 --> 06:07.399
- From what I hear, it
was quite the occurrence.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.203
Brought in folks
from miles around.

06:12.740 --> 06:15.107
All endeavoring to steal a peek

06:16.577 --> 06:19.244
as Isaac here, the
duly appointed foreman,

06:20.314 --> 06:24.149
rose to his feet and
read aloud the verdict.

06:27.388 --> 06:28.954
Condemned to death my brother.

06:31.091 --> 06:35.127
Did it make you proud of
your man, Mrs. Ackerman?

06:36.630 --> 06:40.232
This last one's not rhetorical
and I'm expecting a reply.

06:40.234 --> 06:43.101
Now you're thinking this can
only end bad, you're right.

06:44.438 --> 06:46.905
But tell me the truth and
maybe I'll let the girl live.

06:48.909 --> 06:49.941
- I was proud.

06:51.779 --> 06:54.212
Proud that my
husband could deliver

06:54.214 --> 06:57.249
what he thought was justice.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.217
- Thank you, ma'am.

07:00.821 --> 07:01.720
Sincerely.

07:02.890 --> 07:03.855
- [Isaac] No!

07:03.857 --> 07:08.760
(gun firing)
(Ruth crying)

07:11.932 --> 07:12.764
- Hold!

07:12.766 --> 07:13.799
- Why?

07:13.801 --> 07:15.133
- Girl.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.401
Hey!

07:16.403 --> 07:17.335
Do you bleed?

07:18.539 --> 07:20.305
Are you a woman yet?

07:20.307 --> 07:21.907
- Yes.

07:21.909 --> 07:23.475
- [Gretchen] She comes with us.

07:23.477 --> 07:24.276
- No.

07:24.278 --> 07:26.244
No, no, no, no, no, no!

07:31.819 --> 07:35.387
¶ Oh, you can pray to Jesus ¶

07:35.389 --> 07:39.825
¶ You can do God's will ¶

07:39.827 --> 07:44.896
¶ But you'll never make it
back from Eminence Hill ¶

08:00.581 --> 08:02.814
(snoring)

08:07.120 --> 08:08.587
(thuds)

08:08.589 --> 08:10.755
- Who the hell are you?

08:10.757 --> 08:13.225
- Given the fact that I took
the trouble to send you a wire,

08:13.227 --> 08:15.494
I was expecting you
would already know that.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.163
- Are you here for Garret?

08:23.036 --> 08:24.236
Garret!

08:24.238 --> 08:26.371
Rise and shine, you
got yourself a visitor.

08:27.674 --> 08:28.907
- I don't know you.

08:28.909 --> 08:32.077
- Quincy Hollis Foster,
United States Marshal.

08:32.079 --> 08:34.279
- What can I do for you?

08:34.281 --> 08:37.449
- Would you be so kind as
to give us a moment alone?

08:45.659 --> 08:47.225
- You gonna state your purpose?

08:47.227 --> 08:49.694
- [Quincy] Thank you, I'll
wait until you've finished.

08:51.865 --> 08:52.764
- Done.

08:55.302 --> 08:56.701
- Right to it then.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.937
Tracking a man of
your acquaintance.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.138
Agree to help me find him,

09:00.140 --> 09:02.207
and you walk out of
here tonight a free man.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.009
(Garret laughs)

09:04.011 --> 09:05.210
I amuse you?

09:05.212 --> 09:06.778
- Not in the slightest.

09:08.415 --> 09:09.548
- What are you doing?

09:11.952 --> 09:13.685
- I'm going back to bed.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.288
And if you plan on stayin',

09:17.591 --> 09:19.658
I'd appreciate you cutting
down on the chatter.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.961
- I've just stated that
if you agree to help me,

09:22.963 --> 09:24.296
I will secure your liberty.

09:24.298 --> 09:28.033
- You want me to help
you find Royce Tullis.

09:28.035 --> 09:31.303
And I hear he's been keeping
you boys pretty busy of late.

09:32.372 --> 09:35.273
- Yes, I want you to
help me find Mr. Tullis.

09:35.275 --> 09:38.410
And Gretchen James, Samson
Sullivan, and Cyrus Pope.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.781
A few days ago, they crossed
the final name off their list.

09:44.451 --> 09:45.917
Man by the name of Ackerman.

09:48.622 --> 09:49.754
Killed his wife too.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.491
But they had a daughter.

09:53.493 --> 09:55.660
Might still be alive,
though if that be the case,

09:55.662 --> 09:58.229
by now she's likely
wishing it wasn't so.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.265
- You can't be this simple.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.836
They're cutting me
loose in a day or so.

10:06.073 --> 10:10.909
So help you or not, I'm
flying this rat's nest.

10:10.911 --> 10:13.478
- Ever heard of a
town called Macon?

10:13.480 --> 10:16.615
Folks there sure know the
name of Carson Garret.

10:16.617 --> 10:20.185
Army scout and tracker turned
rustler and highwayman.

10:21.588 --> 10:23.622
Carson Garret, otherwise
known as Marcus Tunstell,

10:23.624 --> 10:25.223
otherwise known
as Carson Miller,

10:25.225 --> 10:27.993
wanted for the crimes
of horse theft, larceny,

10:27.995 --> 10:31.863
and lewd and lascivious conduct
of an uncivilized nature.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.965
Sounds like you had
yourself quite a time.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.234
- What are you pitching here?

10:36.236 --> 10:37.902
- A pardon for past offenses,

10:37.904 --> 10:39.938
granted by Governor
Safford's office.

10:41.241 --> 10:44.676
A chance at some redemption
for an ill-spent life.

10:44.678 --> 10:47.045
And a pleasant thank you.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.414
- Going up against Tullis?

10:49.416 --> 10:51.182
Nothing short of
a death sentence.

10:53.920 --> 10:58.657
- Certainly was that
way for a town marshal,

10:58.659 --> 11:03.128
a territorial magistrate,
and 12 good citizens

11:05.198 --> 11:06.865
that gave his brother the swing.

11:06.867 --> 11:10.301
But at least this
way you get a chance,

11:10.303 --> 11:15.306
albeit a slim one, to slip a
fate so earnestly deserved.

11:19.613 --> 11:23.815
- There's a town not far
from here called Silvermill.

11:23.817 --> 11:24.749
You know it?

11:24.751 --> 11:26.651
- Passed it on my way here.

11:26.653 --> 11:30.522
- There's a saloon
there, hard to miss.

11:30.524 --> 11:35.260
There's a fine woman of
less than honest repute.

11:36.930 --> 11:41.366
You get me outta here, a hot
bath, some fresh clothes,

11:41.368 --> 11:45.003
a ride on that beauty,
you got yourself a deal.

11:52.913 --> 11:56.548
- It's not exactly what you
call an ample sucker, is it?

11:58.719 --> 12:01.219
Now that little
birdie over there

12:02.322 --> 12:05.256
would rightly satisfy
another kind of hunger.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.358
- Get it outta your head, Cyrus.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.693
- We'll reach
Creekside tomorrow,

12:08.695 --> 12:11.329
then Stonetrees a day after.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.233
And you can eat till
your guts burst,

12:15.235 --> 12:16.835
fuck till you can't walk.

12:16.837 --> 12:19.404
You keep your hands
off the blondie.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.338
Sell her intact.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.040
- Blood Feathers.

12:24.044 --> 12:25.944
What the hell for?

12:25.946 --> 12:27.946
- That little stranger
fetch a better price

12:27.948 --> 12:30.749
with the savages than
just about any place else.

12:30.751 --> 12:32.350
- I hate those fuckers.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.553
- You're more than free
to stay at Creekside.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.689
Leaves a better split
for the rest of us.

12:37.691 --> 12:38.656
- I'm not staying.

12:40.660 --> 12:41.559
- All right.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.495
It looks about done.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.802
Got plenty of thirst.

12:54.374 --> 12:57.342
(Gretchen moaning)

12:58.812 --> 13:01.546
(Royce moaning)

13:14.895 --> 13:17.362
- I ain't getting that again.

13:24.771 --> 13:27.438
I do got the right of it though.

13:30.777 --> 13:32.177
- Don't even think it!

13:32.179 --> 13:36.314
You know Royce
wants her unspoiled.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.882
- Care for a little swallow?

13:39.953 --> 13:41.219
Hell, come now.

13:47.727 --> 13:50.361
- Please, I just wanna go home.

13:52.632 --> 13:54.632
- What do you think will happen?

13:54.634 --> 13:55.800
(Ruth screaming)

13:55.802 --> 13:57.869
- The hell is that?

13:57.871 --> 13:58.770
- Cyrus!

13:59.606 --> 14:00.438
- Shit.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.272
- [Ruth] No!

14:01.274 --> 14:02.106
- Come here.

14:02.108 --> 14:02.941
- [Ruth] Please!

14:02.943 --> 14:03.775
- Give it to me.

14:03.777 --> 14:04.609
(Ruth screaming)

14:04.611 --> 14:06.044
- He's off now.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.645
Put it away.

14:07.647 --> 14:08.546
Put it away!

14:12.219 --> 14:13.585
Goddamn.

14:13.587 --> 14:14.519
- Fuckin' whore.

14:14.521 --> 14:15.553
Stick a blade on me, will you?

14:15.555 --> 14:16.621
- I will.

14:16.623 --> 14:17.622
- Listen, you goddamn--

14:17.624 --> 14:18.623
- Hey, hey!

14:18.625 --> 14:20.992
- Oh, shut up!
(fist smacks)

14:22.562 --> 14:23.895
You just walk it off, Cyrus.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.464
- He's just (mumbles).

14:28.134 --> 14:29.167
No true hold.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.670
- We all get some sleep.

14:32.672 --> 14:33.805
We break at sunrise.

14:34.774 --> 14:37.275
(slow music)

15:26.693 --> 15:27.825
- Goddamn it!

15:29.362 --> 15:31.863
(gun firing)

15:33.166 --> 15:36.801
Shit, fuck, filthy
fucking savages!

15:36.803 --> 15:38.303
- The hell, Cyrus?
- What?

15:38.305 --> 15:39.337
- Apaches.

15:39.339 --> 15:40.405
Blood Feathers and everything.

15:40.407 --> 15:41.873
- What?

15:41.875 --> 15:44.375
- Oh, we were just relieved
of our means of travel.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.045
- No fucking way!

15:47.047 --> 15:48.379
- Yes fucking way.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.448
- Well, they weren't
Blood Feathers at least.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.750
- How do you know that?

15:52.752 --> 15:54.719
- 'Cause our throats
ain't split open.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.923
- Hey, bug-eyes.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.795
I know you saw 'em, didn't ya?

16:06.733 --> 16:09.634
Yeah, you saw and you didn't
think to warn us, did you?

16:10.937 --> 16:12.337
I'll make you learn!

16:12.339 --> 16:14.305
- Hey, she's worth
less without her teeth!

16:14.307 --> 16:15.974
- Weasel, hang the weasel.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.710
This little piece of
strange is bad luck.

16:18.712 --> 16:19.544
- That's all?

16:19.546 --> 16:21.179
- Plain and simple.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.014
- Cyrus, you are one
simple son of a bitch.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.315
- Keep on pushing me!

16:24.317 --> 16:25.783
- Cyrus!

16:25.785 --> 16:26.684
Silence!

16:27.587 --> 16:28.419
All right?

16:28.421 --> 16:29.687
We're on foot from here.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.426
Gear up what you can
manage, all right?

16:37.998 --> 16:38.863
Hey.

16:40.467 --> 16:41.366
It true?

16:42.669 --> 16:44.035
You hear them creepin' up?

16:46.339 --> 16:47.238
- No, sir.

16:48.074 --> 16:49.540
- I hope not.

16:49.542 --> 16:50.675
Because bad as
things were for you,

16:50.677 --> 16:51.843
they just got a whole lot worse

16:51.845 --> 16:53.845
now that we gotta
cross the land on foot.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.782
All right, let's get out.

16:59.686 --> 17:00.585
That's it.

17:03.390 --> 17:04.722
Should grab what you can.

17:09.562 --> 17:12.030
(slow music)

17:14.567 --> 17:17.535
(crowd chattering)

17:25.578 --> 17:28.379
- So would you be wanting a
little filly yourself then?

17:30.517 --> 17:31.416
- Thank you, no.

17:33.053 --> 17:33.951
- Are you sure?

17:33.953 --> 17:35.553
You seem a bit wound up.

17:36.656 --> 17:37.855
- I'll be just fine.

17:39.092 --> 17:39.957
Thank you.

17:47.133 --> 17:48.766
- What'll you have, friend?

17:48.768 --> 17:51.035
- Some tea would satisfy.

17:51.037 --> 17:52.804
- Haven't got tea.

17:52.806 --> 17:55.106
But I could put a
fresh pot of coffee on.

17:55.108 --> 17:56.107
- Thank you, no.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.178
Is your water clean?

18:00.180 --> 18:02.346
- Pulled from the
well this morning.

18:02.348 --> 18:03.514
- I'll have that then.

18:10.423 --> 18:14.058
- [Bartender] There
you go, sir, one water.

18:18.865 --> 18:19.997
- Thanks for that.

18:23.503 --> 18:25.703
- You should be thanking
the dude that paid.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.539
- (laughs) Hell, thanks, dude.

18:30.743 --> 18:31.876
- Who is he anyway?

18:34.180 --> 18:36.214
- Oh, some flat-foot lawman.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.417
- You going square
on me, Garret?

18:40.286 --> 18:42.720
- That's just a cat's paw.

18:42.722 --> 18:47.158
He's enlisted me to track down
Royce Tullis and his crew.

18:49.195 --> 18:50.094
- Well then.

18:52.065 --> 18:53.498
- Well?

18:53.500 --> 18:56.033
- Well then, I guess
this is goodbye.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.084
- Hope you enjoyed
yourself, Mr. Garret.

19:13.086 --> 19:16.454
- (laughs) Little romp in
the bush might ease some

19:16.456 --> 19:18.956
of that tension
you're holding onto.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.424
- I don't keep with whores.

19:20.426 --> 19:21.893
- Well, that ain't no fun.

19:23.429 --> 19:25.796
You know, I was thinking.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.398
- Thinking?

19:27.400 --> 19:29.934
- Since we're going up against
the most dangerous gang

19:29.936 --> 19:33.938
in the territory, you could
like purchase me a six-shooter.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.306
Hell, a rifle even.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.142
- That won't be necessary.

19:38.144 --> 19:39.477
- Will it not?

19:39.479 --> 19:41.779
- Don't expect you'll
need to do any fighting.

19:41.781 --> 19:44.949
- We gonna just ask old Tullis
to come along peaceful like?

19:44.951 --> 19:47.585
- All you need to do, Mr.
Garret, is lead me to him.

19:47.587 --> 19:48.853
I can handle the
matter from there.

19:48.855 --> 19:49.854
- Okay then.

19:52.025 --> 19:52.924
- Hey!

19:54.694 --> 19:56.360
- Wow, 2,000.

19:58.264 --> 20:00.498
- Double what they were
offering a week ago.

20:01.901 --> 20:04.435
- You know that much metal's
gonna draw some attention.

20:06.172 --> 20:07.038
- That it will.

20:09.742 --> 20:12.176
(slow music)

20:26.292 --> 20:28.426
(sighs)

20:28.428 --> 20:29.327
- [Royce] Well?

20:31.297 --> 20:33.130
- I swear this
don't make no sense.

20:34.367 --> 20:35.499
- What do you mean?

20:36.636 --> 20:40.938
- Well, we was on the
right trail Creekside,

20:40.940 --> 20:44.141
then this hill'd
be Banshee's Peak.

20:44.143 --> 20:45.610
But it ain't.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.778
- How can you tell?

20:47.780 --> 20:49.113
- Well, if this here
was Banshee's Peak,

20:49.115 --> 20:51.582
then down there would
be Canners Walk.

20:51.584 --> 20:56.654
I don't know what that is down
there, but it ain't Canners.

20:57.190 --> 20:58.756
- We're lost!

20:58.758 --> 21:00.591
- You bitch!
- All right, goddamn it.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.628
- Dimwitted and he don't
know where he's taking us.

21:06.766 --> 21:07.632
- Ease up.

21:08.668 --> 21:09.834
We're gonna figure this out.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.375
- Smoke down there.

21:17.377 --> 21:20.111
Few wisps, like
someone made camp.

21:23.616 --> 21:24.682
- Could be Indian.

21:25.818 --> 21:27.018
- Apaches maybe.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.487
Hell, Blood Feathers even.

21:29.489 --> 21:30.488
- I don't think so.

21:31.724 --> 21:34.592
That smoke could be
seen for miles around.

21:34.594 --> 21:36.594
Blood Feathers never
call attention like that.

21:40.767 --> 21:41.666
All right.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.069
- What say you, Jonah?

21:45.071 --> 21:46.237
Is it about done?

21:47.573 --> 21:48.472
I agree.

21:51.778 --> 21:55.212
Well, speak up, man, if you
want me to share with you.

21:55.214 --> 21:56.347
Desist!

21:59.319 --> 22:02.620
Oh, Jonah, you leave
me only the lamb share.

22:10.430 --> 22:12.797
Well, I need to relieve myself.

22:12.799 --> 22:15.633
Try and resist the temptation
of your larcenous nature

22:15.635 --> 22:16.500
while I'm gone.

22:37.223 --> 22:38.089
- Howdy.

22:45.465 --> 22:48.032
That chop looks awfully tasty.

22:49.469 --> 22:53.170
You wouldn't happen to have
another piece to spare?

22:54.240 --> 22:55.873
Would ya?

22:55.875 --> 22:58.509
- Allow me to interject, sirs.

22:58.511 --> 23:00.244
Poor Jonah here
hasn't even the power

23:00.246 --> 23:01.946
of the simplest of speech,

23:01.948 --> 23:04.749
but luckily for him, I
confabulate well enough

23:04.751 --> 23:05.916
for the two of us.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.152
- What's confabulate?

23:09.722 --> 23:10.921
- Means to talk.

23:12.024 --> 23:13.624
- Oh.

23:13.626 --> 23:15.159
Oh, that's a good word.

23:15.161 --> 23:18.129
I'll remember that one.

23:19.232 --> 23:21.232
- This the road to Creekside?

23:21.234 --> 23:22.733
- Creekside?

23:22.735 --> 23:25.669
Creekside must be 90
leagues from here.

23:25.671 --> 23:27.304
You've quite a
lengthy ride, sir,

23:27.306 --> 23:29.206
if that's your destination.

23:29.208 --> 23:30.608
- What did I tell ya?

23:30.610 --> 23:31.509
- Sorry, boss.

23:32.512 --> 23:33.677
It's 'cause the storm and all.

23:33.679 --> 23:35.446
- Where's this road take us?

23:35.448 --> 23:38.416
- The nearest proper town
would Stark Ridge Hollow.

23:38.418 --> 23:40.484
Not more than two
hours at a trot.

23:40.486 --> 23:42.453
Follow the road,
it'll lead you there.

23:43.256 --> 23:45.356
- Well, we'll be off then.

23:49.962 --> 23:51.061
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

23:51.063 --> 23:51.896
- That one is protective.

23:51.898 --> 23:52.797
Friends, stop.

23:57.203 --> 23:59.203
Jonah, my good
man, curb yourself.

23:59.205 --> 24:02.173
Don't get involved in things
that don't concern you.

24:02.175 --> 24:03.941
- You should listen
to him, Jonah.

24:04.777 --> 24:05.843
- I can take him.

24:06.646 --> 24:07.812
- Fuckin' hell, Cyrus!

24:09.182 --> 24:11.582
- You want that little
piece, she's yours.

24:11.584 --> 24:13.417
Just ease up on that trigger.

24:13.419 --> 24:14.685
- Jonah, please.

24:14.687 --> 24:17.321
Heroics are detrimental
to your health.

24:17.323 --> 24:20.724
(gun firing)
(screams)

24:20.726 --> 24:23.227
- That little birdies
don't fly from me!

24:23.229 --> 24:24.094
- Gretchen!

24:24.997 --> 24:26.330
- Goddamn it.

24:26.332 --> 24:27.531
Get off me, half-wit.

24:29.836 --> 24:32.670
(dramatic music)

24:38.411 --> 24:40.644
- Can't run from me, girl!

24:53.559 --> 24:55.192
- [Royce] Gretchen!

25:05.404 --> 25:07.238
- Hey, ma'am!

25:07.240 --> 25:08.405
Please, help!

25:10.343 --> 25:11.609
- Easy now.

25:11.611 --> 25:12.776
She ain't worth so
much as a corpse.

25:12.778 --> 25:14.345
- Come now, Athaliah.

25:14.347 --> 25:15.246
- On your feet, bitch!

25:17.783 --> 25:19.116
- Boys all right?

25:19.118 --> 25:20.050
You all right?

25:20.052 --> 25:20.951
- Whoa!

25:24.156 --> 25:25.856
- Good day, friends.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.525
Nothing to concern
yourself with.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.528
Boys are gonna
want to hold back!

25:32.164 --> 25:33.397
- [Man] Salutations.

25:36.569 --> 25:37.701
- Same to you.

25:37.703 --> 25:39.670
- Welcome to Eminence Hill.

25:39.672 --> 25:40.738
- Sir, help!

25:41.974 --> 25:43.841
- Girl's a thief.

25:43.843 --> 25:45.376
Caught her trying to
part with my purse.

25:45.378 --> 25:46.977
- A thief, you say?

25:46.979 --> 25:48.379
She hasn't the look of one.

25:48.381 --> 25:50.514
- Don't let her youthful
visage fool you.

25:51.651 --> 25:54.318
Turn her over first
lawman I come across.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.887
- We're all lawmen
here of a sort.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.455
- And what sort would that be?

26:00.726 --> 26:02.526
- No, no!

26:02.528 --> 26:03.494
Stop, help!

26:05.097 --> 26:08.332
- Ah, God's law.

26:08.334 --> 26:10.267
- There's no other kind.

26:10.269 --> 26:11.468
- No argument here.

26:13.839 --> 26:14.738
You got a name?

26:14.740 --> 26:15.606
- I'm Dathan.

26:16.442 --> 26:17.675
- Dathan.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.376
- He's not faring
so well either.

26:20.246 --> 26:21.879
- I can barely fucking walk.

26:21.881 --> 26:24.915
- You should unencumber
yourselves at our
Father's house.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.585
Fresh water for you and
yours, food and respite.

26:29.055 --> 26:30.754
Tend to that wound of yours.

26:32.158 --> 26:34.224
- It works for me, boss.

26:36.796 --> 26:38.529
- I guess I can't
rightly refuse.

26:43.069 --> 26:44.368
Lead the way, friend.

26:46.339 --> 26:47.237
- Come then.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.908
(upbeat music)

27:05.157 --> 27:07.658
- I don't mean to question
your proficiency, Mr. Garret,

27:07.660 --> 27:11.061
but we seem to be heading
north rather than south.

27:11.063 --> 27:12.496
- Well, is that so?

27:14.467 --> 27:17.434
- Macon lies to the south, as
does the Ackerman homestead.

27:18.270 --> 27:20.704
- You wanna find Royce Tullis,

27:20.706 --> 27:23.374
he ain't in Macon or
the Ackerman place.

27:23.376 --> 27:25.542
- No, but ought we not try and
pick up his trail from there?

27:25.544 --> 27:27.678
How else do you
intend to track him?

27:27.680 --> 27:29.513
- If you wanted
yourself a tracker,

27:29.515 --> 27:31.982
shoulda hired
yourself a redskin.

27:31.984 --> 27:34.818
If you wanna find Tullis,
we're headed north.

27:36.222 --> 27:37.621
- You know where he is then?

27:37.623 --> 27:38.989
- I've got an idea.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.125
Better than backtracking,
in any case.

27:44.196 --> 27:45.296
- How?

27:45.297 --> 27:46.397
- Well, you say he
has a girl with him?

27:46.399 --> 27:48.565
Only one reason
he'd have a girl.

27:49.602 --> 27:51.268
Oh, and it ain't what you think.

27:52.204 --> 27:55.372
Old Gretchen cut his balls off.

27:55.374 --> 27:58.208
No, he's got an eye
toward selling her.

27:58.210 --> 27:59.643
- Selling her?

27:59.645 --> 28:02.513
- Yeah, they fetch a good
price, they got all their teeth.

28:04.517 --> 28:07.217
- And where would he go to
broker such a transaction?

28:08.087 --> 28:09.553
- Well, you got old Mexico,

28:09.555 --> 28:11.488
but that's crawling
with headhunters.

28:12.291 --> 28:14.992
Fetch a better price up north.

28:14.994 --> 28:18.529
My bottom dollar says
he's headed to Stonetrees.

28:18.531 --> 28:20.164
- Never heard of it.

28:20.166 --> 28:21.832
- Blood Feathers territory.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.100
- Blood Feathers?

28:23.102 --> 28:24.268
- Know 'em?

28:24.270 --> 28:25.903
- Name rings out.

28:25.905 --> 28:29.873
Indians, Apache and
Navajo renegades along
with other sorts.

28:29.875 --> 28:32.276
- Hardest killers
in the territory.

28:32.278 --> 28:34.344
Put the Mongolian
hordes to shame.

28:36.682 --> 28:37.698
- I see.

28:37.699 --> 28:38.715
And that's where you
believe Tullis is headed.

28:38.718 --> 28:39.616
- I do.

28:42.154 --> 28:43.053
- Very well then.

28:44.223 --> 28:45.255
- Hey, the reward,

28:46.392 --> 28:48.125
cut it right down
the middle, right?

28:49.628 --> 28:50.527
- We do not.

28:51.464 --> 28:52.529
- How do you figure?

28:53.933 --> 28:56.633
- Well, you made your terms
plain enough back in Riley.

28:57.970 --> 29:00.270
A bath, fresh clothes,
and a turn in the velvet.

29:02.341 --> 29:03.807
- (spits) You're shitting me!

29:05.177 --> 29:07.778
- I have met my obligations
and you will do the same.

29:07.780 --> 29:10.380
- Well, I bet you don't
make many friends, do ya?

29:23.162 --> 29:26.630
- Folks are friendly.

29:27.666 --> 29:30.067
- A little too friendly.

29:30.069 --> 29:31.935
- Doesn't smell though.

29:31.937 --> 29:33.303
I mean, he's good too.

29:36.575 --> 29:37.708
- I don't like it.

29:37.710 --> 29:39.643
- You never like it.

29:39.645 --> 29:44.314
- People seem kinda weird.

29:45.417 --> 29:46.984
- That means a lot
coming from you.

29:58.464 --> 30:01.265
(dramatic music)

30:13.212 --> 30:17.047
- You the one they call Father?

30:17.049 --> 30:18.515
- I'm Noah.

30:20.853 --> 30:22.853
Welcome to my ark.

30:27.793 --> 30:30.127
- Fine spread you got here.

30:30.129 --> 30:31.028
- Thank you.

30:32.865 --> 30:35.499
- [Wilhelmina] Rejoice, Father.

30:35.501 --> 30:36.767
- Oh, Sister Wilhelmina.

30:38.037 --> 30:39.269
Looks wonderful.

30:40.639 --> 30:43.440
- That is one
tasty-looking bird.

30:53.219 --> 30:54.117
What?

30:55.154 --> 30:56.220
Problem, sunshine?

30:57.323 --> 31:00.958
- Let us have some
words before we partake.

31:10.035 --> 31:12.636
As we bow our heads,

31:14.340 --> 31:18.008
let us thank the
Lord for his bounty

31:18.010 --> 31:22.679
and may this harvest
give us strength

31:22.681 --> 31:24.815
so that we may serve him better.

31:24.817 --> 31:27.718
(Gretchen snorts)

31:32.892 --> 31:37.694
For we know that
only through service

31:38.731 --> 31:42.833
and worship of him
shall we have salvation.

31:46.472 --> 31:47.304
Amen.

31:47.306 --> 31:48.205
- Amen, let's dig in.

31:59.184 --> 32:00.450
That's some flavor.

32:00.452 --> 32:02.119
- I'm glad it's to your liking.

32:04.023 --> 32:05.589
- Where do you hail from?

32:06.592 --> 32:10.360
- Well, uh, there and about.

32:12.865 --> 32:16.333
- So it's only by happenstance
that you're here in Eminence?

32:18.203 --> 32:19.970
- Despite our thief,

32:19.972 --> 32:22.306
wouldn't come across
this place any other way.

32:23.676 --> 32:28.245
- Yeah, I can't say I ever
heard of y'all before.

32:29.348 --> 32:31.782
I mean, I ain't ever
seen a map, you know?

32:31.784 --> 32:33.784
- We keep to ourselves.

32:34.853 --> 32:35.752
- Homesteaders.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.390
You know what'll go
great with your bird?

32:41.193 --> 32:42.592
A little bit of old Taos.

32:44.229 --> 32:45.896
- I beg your pardon?

32:45.898 --> 32:46.797
- Whiskey.

32:48.033 --> 32:48.932
Beer even.

32:51.370 --> 32:52.569
- Well, I'm sorry.

32:53.672 --> 32:56.807
We never partake in
spirituous libations.

32:57.643 --> 32:58.542
- Wow.

32:59.712 --> 33:02.012
That's just plain uncivilized.

33:05.451 --> 33:07.951
- I feel dizzy all of a sudden.

33:08.988 --> 33:10.554
- Me too, I feel...

33:21.600 --> 33:23.166
- It's best not to fight it.

33:27.539 --> 33:28.672
Let it take you.

33:35.647 --> 33:38.115
(calm music)

33:43.822 --> 33:44.688
- Snort?

33:45.557 --> 33:46.456
- Yeah.

33:48.794 --> 33:51.428
- Days are warm but I do
mind how cold it gets up here

33:51.430 --> 33:52.662
when the sun goes down.

33:54.033 --> 33:55.098
- Hey, hand me that.

33:56.335 --> 33:58.201
(twig snapping)

33:58.203 --> 33:59.102
- You hear that?

34:00.005 --> 34:01.338
- No.

34:01.340 --> 34:03.140
- Something's out there.

34:03.142 --> 34:04.975
- Coyotes probably.

34:04.977 --> 34:07.044
- [Carson] Hey up there!

34:08.247 --> 34:09.446
- Who's out there?

34:09.448 --> 34:12.482
- Name's Garret,
coming in friendly.

34:12.484 --> 34:14.117
Got the law with me.

34:14.119 --> 34:16.286
We don't want any trouble.

34:16.288 --> 34:18.889
- How's about both you boys
step on down from those horses?

34:18.891 --> 34:19.956
- As you like.

34:25.998 --> 34:26.897
Howdy.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.600
- You tell your boy back
there no sudden moves.

34:30.602 --> 34:33.970
- We just come for a
simple passage of words

34:33.972 --> 34:36.907
and a little warmth
by your fire there.

34:40.212 --> 34:41.545
- All right, pop a squat,

34:41.547 --> 34:43.246
but I'm gonna keep
my eyes on ya.

34:44.917 --> 34:45.916
- [Carson] Obliged.

34:47.386 --> 34:48.685
- Snort?

34:48.687 --> 34:49.786
- Don't mind if I do.

34:53.992 --> 34:55.025
Thank you, partner.

34:56.428 --> 34:57.861
- Where are you fellas headed?

34:57.863 --> 34:59.096
- Nowhere special.

35:00.365 --> 35:01.264
And you?

35:02.534 --> 35:03.433
- Of a kind.

35:04.636 --> 35:05.669
Just a ride about.

35:06.939 --> 35:08.338
- A ride about, you say?

35:11.076 --> 35:13.243
- We're headed the same
place you boys are.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.781
But we're looking to split
that reward four ways.

35:19.051 --> 35:20.917
- I don't know what you mean.

35:20.919 --> 35:22.419
- Is that so?

35:22.421 --> 35:23.753
What about you, Foster?

35:26.558 --> 35:27.991
Call yourself the law now?

35:27.993 --> 35:29.926
That badge must have
cost a tidy sum.

35:33.832 --> 35:36.466
- I'm sorry, you seem to
have me at a disadvantage.

35:39.738 --> 35:41.004
- You don't remember me.

35:43.876 --> 35:45.842
Sure as pain I could
never forget you.

35:46.778 --> 35:48.011
Take a good look, boys.

35:49.047 --> 35:51.548
Got a real legend in our midst.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.683
Quincy Hollis Foster himself.

35:55.621 --> 35:56.553
You heard of him?

35:59.291 --> 36:00.190
- I have.

36:01.894 --> 36:03.160
- That so, Charlie?

36:03.162 --> 36:04.895
Why don't you tell us
all what you've heard?

36:07.533 --> 36:08.431
- He's a killer.

36:10.135 --> 36:11.034
- Killer.

36:12.404 --> 36:14.771
Boys, that man's close to
Armageddon in the flesh.

36:14.773 --> 36:17.841
Make you shudder to hear half
the things they say he's done.

36:19.178 --> 36:20.177
- Things I've done.

36:23.849 --> 36:27.284
The past tense
underscores the lack

36:27.286 --> 36:29.152
of importance this subject holds

36:30.923 --> 36:33.623
to the present dilemma.

36:33.625 --> 36:34.524
- Which is?

36:37.763 --> 36:40.864
- From what I've been told
of Mr. Tullis and his crew,

36:42.301 --> 36:46.703
the thoughtful money would be
on him wiping you boys out.

36:55.180 --> 36:58.114
There's little sense
in taking a chance

36:58.116 --> 37:00.417
after such efforts have
been spent on my part.

37:03.322 --> 37:05.722
- What, you just think
you're gonna run us off?

37:08.427 --> 37:09.326
- No.

37:10.395 --> 37:11.361
- [Man] Well then.

37:15.500 --> 37:18.068
(guns firing)

37:33.585 --> 37:34.784
- Fire's very pleasant.

37:37.289 --> 37:42.192
- If you don't mind, I think
I'll make my own bedroll.

37:44.896 --> 37:46.563
- Do as you please.

38:09.521 --> 38:10.420
- Royce?

38:12.124 --> 38:13.023
Royce!

38:15.460 --> 38:16.459
- Gretchen.

38:17.429 --> 38:18.328
- Cy?

38:21.400 --> 38:22.966
- What's going on?

38:27.472 --> 38:28.371
- Royce?

38:30.742 --> 38:33.476
(ominous music)

38:55.400 --> 38:56.299
- Hey!

38:57.269 --> 38:58.501
Rise and shine.

38:58.503 --> 39:01.171
(Royce groans)

39:06.478 --> 39:09.045
- Know who you're mixing with?

39:11.616 --> 39:14.117
You know who you're mixing with?

39:14.119 --> 39:17.053
- That's the question
we first need answered.

39:17.055 --> 39:19.122
Then we can talk of
how you came upon us

39:19.124 --> 39:21.725
and if we should anticipate
any more visitors.

39:23.328 --> 39:28.031
But for all in proper
order, who are you?

39:30.502 --> 39:31.701
- I'm Royce Tullis.

39:33.572 --> 39:35.171
- Name's not foreign to me.

39:36.475 --> 39:38.508
- That's never a surprise.

39:38.510 --> 39:40.210
- Understandable.

39:40.212 --> 39:42.045
Because if I knew
who I was holding,

39:42.047 --> 39:43.880
I'd be a fool to misuse him so.

39:45.350 --> 39:50.420
- (mumbles) Soon as I get out
of a bit of a situation here.

39:52.090 --> 39:55.558
I give an offer to
release my people, me.

40:00.699 --> 40:03.333
We agree to look beyond this.

40:03.335 --> 40:06.136
- I'm not interested in
looking beyond anything.

40:06.138 --> 40:07.370
- Christ.

40:07.372 --> 40:08.571
(Royce groans)

40:08.573 --> 40:10.707
- I'll knock the
devil out of you, boy!

40:12.511 --> 40:14.077
- The strike was
for the blasphemy.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.345
If you're able to refrain,

40:15.347 --> 40:17.280
then you can keep the
rest of your smile.

40:18.817 --> 40:21.184
Now please, answer the question.

40:24.823 --> 40:26.556
- You're a dead man.

40:27.626 --> 40:28.591
All of you.

40:36.234 --> 40:37.901
What are you doing?

40:37.903 --> 40:39.436
What are you doing?

40:39.438 --> 40:41.771
(groaning)

40:43.275 --> 40:44.841
- [Man] Left hand.

40:44.843 --> 40:47.377
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

40:47.379 --> 40:49.813
- You'd rather a
right hand gunslinger?

40:49.815 --> 40:51.347
- [Royce] No, hold on!

40:51.349 --> 40:54.117
(screams)

40:54.119 --> 40:55.251
- Answer.

40:55.253 --> 40:56.553
- What, goddamn it?

40:58.990 --> 41:01.224
(choking)

41:02.561 --> 41:04.027
- Last time.

41:05.197 --> 41:07.230
How'd you find us?

41:09.734 --> 41:10.600
Hold.

41:12.904 --> 41:14.604
- It was, it wasn't planned.

41:15.674 --> 41:17.140
We were chasing down a child.

41:18.310 --> 41:20.977
She broke away from us
and came upon y'all.

41:22.347 --> 41:25.081
- By the looks of her, she'd
have issues stealing a chicken.

41:26.318 --> 41:27.750
Who is she?

41:27.752 --> 41:28.651
- Why?

41:29.754 --> 41:32.355
What could you possibly
care about her?

41:32.357 --> 41:33.590
- You abducted her.

41:35.527 --> 41:36.559
From where?

41:37.662 --> 41:40.630
And is anyone liable to
come looking for her?

41:40.632 --> 41:42.432
- No one's gonna
come looking for her

41:42.434 --> 41:44.000
because we left none alive.

41:46.571 --> 41:50.907
But the manner in which I
left her people is nothing

41:50.909 --> 41:53.510
compared to what's
going to happen to you

41:53.512 --> 41:55.378
if you don't cut me loose.

42:01.052 --> 42:03.553
- It's gonna be a long
night for you, Mr. Tullis,

42:05.056 --> 42:07.123
but we'll break
this defiant streak.

42:11.463 --> 42:14.030
(Royce spits)

42:18.904 --> 42:21.504
(birds cawing)

42:24.442 --> 42:28.478
- Be easy on that,
needs to last all day.

42:28.480 --> 42:29.812
- Hell's gotta be colder.

42:31.116 --> 42:32.348
- You know, if we push through,

42:32.350 --> 42:34.984
we'll make it to Sharon
Springs by nightfall.

42:36.555 --> 42:38.788
- (sighs) And if we
stop for a respite?

42:38.790 --> 42:40.857
- (laughs) The only source
of fresh water for miles.

42:40.859 --> 42:43.359
We stop before then, we die.

42:44.963 --> 42:47.463
- I take it you're used to
these horrendous conditions.

42:47.465 --> 42:49.032
- I am.

42:49.034 --> 42:50.500
- Myself, I fear I
never will acclimate

42:50.502 --> 42:53.369
to extremeness of
weather, hot or cold.

42:54.673 --> 42:56.806
- Well, I wouldn't
grow too sour.

42:56.808 --> 43:00.209
Seems like you've developed
a comfort for other things.

43:00.211 --> 43:01.377
- Suppose that's true.

43:03.448 --> 43:07.617
- It doesn't unsettle you at
all, does it, killing folks?

43:09.487 --> 43:11.654
- I do only as my
obligations dictate.

43:12.724 --> 43:14.223
- And that's how
you reckon with it.

43:14.225 --> 43:15.592
- You know, for a
man who once rode

43:15.594 --> 43:17.493
with the most vile
outlaw in the territory,

43:17.495 --> 43:19.262
you seem curiously judgmental.

43:19.264 --> 43:21.197
- I've done my share
of bloodletting,

43:21.199 --> 43:23.967
just never took to it the
way men like you have.

43:23.969 --> 43:25.735
(Quincy laughs)

43:25.737 --> 43:27.170
You find that amusing?

43:28.273 --> 43:29.973
- There are no men
like me, Mr. Garret.

43:31.409 --> 43:32.775
- Well, I know of one.

43:34.179 --> 43:36.646
If fates were kind, you'll
wind up ending each other

43:36.648 --> 43:37.947
before this thing's over.

43:40.719 --> 43:43.086
- World would be better
off for it, I suppose.

43:48.259 --> 43:50.760
(slow music)

43:54.332 --> 43:55.498
- Hey.

43:55.500 --> 43:56.399
Hey, Royce, Royce.

43:57.869 --> 43:58.701
Royce.

43:58.703 --> 43:59.936
- Royce?

43:59.938 --> 44:01.971
Is Royce in there with you?

44:01.973 --> 44:03.773
- You sons of bitches.

44:03.775 --> 44:05.875
You sons of bitches!

44:05.877 --> 44:07.744
- Cyrus, goddamn it, answer me!

44:09.981 --> 44:10.947
Pig scum!

44:11.716 --> 44:13.049
Just you wait.

44:13.051 --> 44:15.618
I'm gonna delight in
making you suffer.

44:17.355 --> 44:19.155
Hey, where are you taking her?

44:19.157 --> 44:20.423
Oh, can't ya hear me?

44:21.393 --> 44:22.959
Swine fuckers!

44:28.099 --> 44:29.098
- Good afternoon.

44:29.968 --> 44:31.934
Apologies about yesterday,

44:31.936 --> 44:34.303
but today will see you
fare better, I believe.

44:35.106 --> 44:36.339
Thanks to you, brothers,

44:36.341 --> 44:38.141
but I can take count
of her from here.

44:41.446 --> 44:45.415
I am Sister Abigail but
you may call me Abby.

44:46.317 --> 44:47.216
- Ruth.

44:48.620 --> 44:52.555
- By his blessing, may she
share my harvest and home.

45:05.937 --> 45:08.104
"Where you go, I will go.

45:09.174 --> 45:11.708
"And where you
stay, I will stay.

45:13.044 --> 45:17.714
"Your people will be my
people and your God my God."

45:21.352 --> 45:22.251
- What?

45:23.354 --> 45:25.488
- Recital of your
namesake, Ruth.

45:26.558 --> 45:28.758
Pure of heart and
friend of God's people.

45:31.896 --> 45:35.031
See now, Athaliah,
what a meager amount

45:35.033 --> 45:39.902
of tenderness can achieve in
restoring the wayward lamb.

45:41.039 --> 45:41.938
- Yes, ma'am.

45:43.374 --> 45:46.809
- As with all things, only
possible through the Lord.

45:47.846 --> 45:48.745
- Yes.

45:51.015 --> 45:51.981
- And why is that?

45:54.419 --> 45:56.886
- Because the righteous
only act in...

45:59.958 --> 46:01.357
- [Abby] In the furtherance.

46:01.359 --> 46:03.226
- Furtherance of his will.

46:03.228 --> 46:04.360
- Quite right, child.

46:08.767 --> 46:09.966
- "And as they
continued to ask him,

46:09.968 --> 46:11.834
"he stood up and said to them,

46:11.836 --> 46:14.470
"let him who is without
sin among you be the first

46:14.472 --> 46:16.272
"to throw a stone at her."

46:16.274 --> 46:17.840
(knocking)

46:17.842 --> 46:18.741
- Yes?

46:23.448 --> 46:24.781
- How lovely you look.

46:25.784 --> 46:27.250
- Thank you.

46:27.252 --> 46:29.519
- Brother Dathan waits
for us in the parlor.

46:35.693 --> 46:36.592
Brother?

46:45.970 --> 46:48.871
- Sister, would you give
us a moment of privacy?

46:48.873 --> 46:49.772
- Yes, Brother.

46:56.247 --> 46:57.713
- Have a seat, please.

47:04.823 --> 47:06.789
Where should we begin?

47:06.791 --> 47:08.324
- I don't know--

47:08.326 --> 47:10.960
- Why not start with how you
came by such sordid company

47:10.962 --> 47:13.496
in the first place,
and more importantly,

47:15.533 --> 47:17.099
how you found us.

47:18.603 --> 47:20.136
- It wasn't anyone's intent.

47:21.272 --> 47:22.572
After they...

47:24.342 --> 47:28.344
They came to our farm one day
and killed my mother and pa.

47:29.480 --> 47:31.547
All on account of Pa
having sat on a jury

47:31.549 --> 47:34.383
that found Mr. Tullis'
brother guilty of murder.

47:35.954 --> 47:38.955
Mr. Tullis was out for
revenge for his dead kin,

47:40.792 --> 47:45.862
so they killed him and took me.

47:48.333 --> 47:50.600
While on the road, we
came across two men,

47:51.436 --> 47:53.836
one white and one colored.

47:53.838 --> 47:56.172
The colored man helped
me make a break for it

47:57.342 --> 48:00.009
and I can only figure
they killed them too.

48:00.011 --> 48:00.877
- I see.

48:02.447 --> 48:05.481
- I wasn't looking or paying
heed to where I was going.

48:06.718 --> 48:09.118
My only aim was to get away.

48:10.188 --> 48:13.589
But by the time
Gretchen caught me,

48:14.592 --> 48:16.626
I was here with you folk.

48:20.698 --> 48:22.098
- I believe you.

48:23.902 --> 48:26.736
And it seems you've
suffered a grave injustice.

48:28.172 --> 48:29.505
Good day to you, miss.

48:33.678 --> 48:34.543
- Mister?

48:36.714 --> 48:37.980
What's gonna happen now?

48:40.752 --> 48:42.585
- Father will preside over
a trial in the morning

48:42.587 --> 48:43.920
for your companions.

48:45.156 --> 48:46.722
After which it's highly likely

48:46.724 --> 48:49.292
you'll never have
to see them again.

48:49.294 --> 48:50.760
- So you're gonna kill them?

48:51.863 --> 48:54.063
- They will be called to
account for their sin.

48:55.266 --> 48:57.199
What fate awaits
them is up to the--

48:57.201 --> 49:00.336
- If that be so, I'm glad
and I thank you for it.

49:00.338 --> 49:01.837
Some may call it wicked,

49:01.839 --> 49:03.940
but my desire for their
blood weighs heavy on me.

49:05.243 --> 49:08.344
- No, miss, not wicked,

49:09.948 --> 49:11.914
but vengeance is
the Lord's alone.

49:23.127 --> 49:25.928
- Why you stare
at him like that?

49:27.065 --> 49:31.233
- I've never seen anybody better

49:31.235 --> 49:35.871
than Mr. Tullis
like that before.

49:39.243 --> 49:41.777
- Hell, he break free
and want more, do you?

49:46.584 --> 49:48.718
Man's only flesh
and blood after all.

49:50.088 --> 49:54.857
- What do you reckon
they'll do to us?

49:57.328 --> 49:59.962
(sighs)

49:59.964 --> 50:01.630
- Nothing pleasing, I'm certain.

50:05.436 --> 50:08.738
- They're gonna
torture us, ain't they?

50:14.145 --> 50:16.212
Sever our fingers.

50:17.115 --> 50:18.247
- Are you scared, boy?

50:19.417 --> 50:20.616
- Of course he is.

50:22.387 --> 50:23.819
Be a fool not to be.

50:26.090 --> 50:27.690
Samson?

50:27.692 --> 50:28.791
Can you hear me, darlin'?

50:28.793 --> 50:30.793
Ain't no shame in it.

50:30.795 --> 50:33.162
No man alive's
above the jitters.

50:34.065 --> 50:35.765
- Yes ma'am.

50:38.569 --> 50:39.502
- [Man] That one.

50:41.239 --> 50:42.038
- [Man] Come on, boy.

50:42.040 --> 50:42.872
(Samson screaming)

50:42.874 --> 50:43.939
- Samson!

50:43.941 --> 50:45.674
- Down, boy.

50:45.676 --> 50:47.910
- Leave him be, you cunts!

51:00.191 --> 51:02.658
(slow music)

51:32.056 --> 51:34.957
(water splashing)

51:40.164 --> 51:43.232
(footsteps tapping)

51:44.368 --> 51:46.435
- Garret, you've led us
directly into an ambush.

51:46.437 --> 51:49.405
Somehow you've managed to
descend even lower in my esteem.

51:50.908 --> 51:52.708
- That really stings, boss.

51:55.146 --> 51:57.746
Hold on, boys, we
don't want any trouble.

51:57.748 --> 51:59.115
- Not looking for trouble?

52:02.253 --> 52:03.886
That's a first for you, Garret.

52:03.888 --> 52:06.055
- Silky Foal.

52:06.057 --> 52:06.989
- Sylvia now.

52:08.326 --> 52:10.893
- I don't care about the
handle, I'm glad to see ya.

52:14.031 --> 52:15.331
- Who's your friend?

52:15.333 --> 52:16.532
- [Carson] He's a...

52:16.534 --> 52:18.901
- US Marshal Quincy
Hollis Foster.

52:20.505 --> 52:23.205
- You bring the law
to my camp, Garret?

52:23.207 --> 52:26.342
- [Carson] I didn't know
you were holed up here.

52:26.344 --> 52:28.043
- What's he telling her?

52:28.045 --> 52:29.612
- Hey, we've got money.

52:29.614 --> 52:32.314
We'll gladly compensate
for bed and board.

52:32.316 --> 52:35.184
- You bring this man here,
this is most unwelcome.

52:35.186 --> 52:36.485
- Ma'am, if I may...

52:41.759 --> 52:43.692
Whatever your crimes may be,

52:43.694 --> 52:46.028
I can assure you I have no
intent on being a bother.

52:46.030 --> 52:49.031
As your friend Mr.
Garret rightly said,

52:49.033 --> 52:51.400
it's fresh water and
some cooked food,

52:51.402 --> 52:52.601
that's all we're after.

52:53.804 --> 52:55.137
- What do you pay with?

52:55.139 --> 52:57.239
- Whatever your preference,
silver or paper.

52:57.241 --> 52:58.874
- Got more than enough of both.

53:00.044 --> 53:01.410
- What will you take then?

53:03.481 --> 53:04.380
- Whiskey.

53:05.316 --> 53:06.248
We ran out.

53:12.490 --> 53:13.923
- It's your lucky day.

53:13.925 --> 53:18.527
This is the best wildcat
this side of old Mexico.

53:20.331 --> 53:21.463
- Not much here.

53:21.465 --> 53:23.532
- But every drop's pure heaven.

53:26.103 --> 53:27.002
- Diego.

53:27.939 --> 53:29.405
See our friends get to camp.

53:29.407 --> 53:31.507
Tell Alejandro I
said care of 'em.

53:33.711 --> 53:37.680
(speaking in foreign language)

53:41.285 --> 53:42.851
(upbeat music)

53:42.853 --> 53:45.854
(crowd chattering)

54:00.938 --> 54:03.272
- I thought you were dry.

54:03.274 --> 54:04.473
- (mumbles) Drink beer.

54:05.610 --> 54:07.977
'Cause a fool sold the
last bottle of whiskey

54:07.979 --> 54:09.178
to a frumpy old man.

54:10.348 --> 54:11.614
Two bottles of medicine.

54:13.317 --> 54:15.184
You can't get drunk
off of medicine.

54:16.187 --> 54:18.087
- Alejandro, my good man.

54:18.089 --> 54:21.190
Is that the scent of whiskey
I smell on your breath?

54:21.192 --> 54:22.558
- Go away.

54:22.560 --> 54:24.460
- And what of you, fine sir?

54:24.462 --> 54:26.895
Have you any spirits?

54:26.897 --> 54:28.030
- Oh, fresh out.

54:29.033 --> 54:30.699
- I'm disappointed.

54:43.447 --> 54:44.380
- So fine.

54:45.516 --> 54:46.915
Like rays of sunshine.

54:49.320 --> 54:50.185
- What?

54:51.322 --> 54:52.888
- Your hair, it's lovely.

54:56.560 --> 54:57.459
- Thank you.

55:01.599 --> 55:04.099
- I think Father Noah
intends for you to join us.

55:05.303 --> 55:06.201
I'm glad.

55:09.273 --> 55:11.106
- And what if I
don't want to stay?

55:13.511 --> 55:14.610
- Where would you go?

55:16.347 --> 55:17.579
Your folks are gone.

55:19.216 --> 55:20.115
Are they not?

55:23.387 --> 55:27.022
Besides, no one is ever
permitted to leave.

55:28.326 --> 55:29.792
Father says that
those who know of us

55:29.794 --> 55:31.460
must never be able to depart.

55:32.897 --> 55:35.998
For it's only that the sinful
know not of our sanctuary,

55:36.000 --> 55:38.567
that we thrive in the
light of the Lord.

55:47.845 --> 55:49.411
(gasping)

55:49.413 --> 55:50.312
- Again.

55:51.215 --> 55:52.881
How'd you come to find us?

55:55.486 --> 55:58.420
- By chasing that little cunny.

55:58.422 --> 55:59.321
I swear.

56:01.726 --> 56:02.725
- That'll suffice.

56:09.367 --> 56:10.933
- [Noah] What's your notion?

56:10.935 --> 56:13.202
- They've all said the
same thing more or less.

56:13.204 --> 56:14.803
We still have one more

56:14.805 --> 56:17.973
but to bedevil a woman
would put a strain

56:17.975 --> 56:19.641
on my conscience, Father.

56:20.411 --> 56:22.244
- It's not necessary.

56:23.247 --> 56:25.481
Eminence Hill is safe.

56:29.286 --> 56:34.356
¶ Bury me not on
the lone prairie ¶

56:37.595 --> 56:41.897
¶ Coyotes howling,
wind blows free ¶

56:50.908 --> 56:52.775
- Your friend doesn't
look so happy.

56:53.978 --> 56:56.578
- He's not one for fine company.

56:58.015 --> 56:59.982
- Or company of any sort.

57:02.219 --> 57:05.621
- Sad part is, he's
the one with the money.

57:17.168 --> 57:19.034
- Oh, thank you.

57:19.036 --> 57:19.935
No change?

57:42.460 --> 57:44.326
- Something regarding
your personage

57:45.463 --> 57:48.197
is awfully pressing
on that man's mind.

57:48.199 --> 57:49.231
- It would seem so.

57:51.335 --> 57:54.069
(ominous music)

57:58.576 --> 58:00.542
- Quincy Foster?

58:00.544 --> 58:01.910
- Not the slightest.

58:01.912 --> 58:05.547
- Mason Mills, Staff
Sergeant, Third Cavalry.

58:06.484 --> 58:07.583
As was.

58:08.686 --> 58:10.385
- Fascinating, what
can I do for you?

58:10.387 --> 58:12.888
- Carson Garret, the
(mumbles) Southern.

58:14.024 --> 58:15.757
- That was a long
time ago, partner.

58:15.759 --> 58:18.627
- Yeah, I used to know a lot
of the boys from the Southern.

58:18.629 --> 58:20.896
It's sad to see that
you're taking up

58:20.898 --> 58:23.866
with such a sordid character.

58:23.868 --> 58:25.834
- You just need to
leave it, friend.

58:25.836 --> 58:27.302
- Advisable idea.

58:28.572 --> 58:30.239
But some things need to be said.

58:31.342 --> 58:32.875
- We all have our history.

58:33.677 --> 58:36.278
- Yeah, none of us are angels.

58:36.280 --> 58:39.948
Hell, I'm just a bounty
chasing road dog myself.

58:40.784 --> 58:43.218
But I tell you, in 100 years,

58:43.220 --> 58:47.689
only a time or two has hell
spit out a man such as this.

58:49.026 --> 58:51.660
A fellow with a coldness about
him that just ain't human.

58:53.063 --> 58:55.230
A creature that takes a life

58:55.232 --> 58:57.799
as simple as drawing a breath.

58:57.801 --> 58:59.401
And one who don't discriminate

58:59.403 --> 59:02.104
about whose life
ends at his hands.

59:04.508 --> 59:07.075
- You make me sound
quite the monster.

59:07.077 --> 59:08.610
- Maybe you should
ask your friend

59:08.612 --> 59:11.613
to talk to those people at
Beacon's Hope about that.

59:11.615 --> 59:14.082
You do remember Beacon's
Hope, Mr. Foster?

59:15.119 --> 59:19.388
Quiet place, as peaceful
as you would like,

59:19.390 --> 59:22.057
until they found
gold in the creek.

59:23.460 --> 59:27.162
And those folks musta thought
that they had struck fortune.

59:27.164 --> 59:31.500
That is until the Hurst
Mining Company came in,

59:31.502 --> 59:33.035
sent Mr. Foster.

59:33.904 --> 59:35.070
- It was a business transaction

59:35.072 --> 59:37.773
with some regrettable
attributes.

59:37.775 --> 59:40.742
- Hurst kinda did pretty
well with it, didn't he?

59:40.744 --> 59:43.645
Because he ended up
seizing the mining rights

59:43.647 --> 59:47.082
because there wasn't a soul
left to deny his claim.

59:47.084 --> 59:51.687
You see, Beacon's was founded
by Kansas abolitionists

59:51.689 --> 59:55.357
as a safe haven
for former slaves.

59:55.359 --> 59:57.292
And when Mr. Hurst got the word

59:57.294 --> 59:59.428
that there was
color to be found,

59:59.430 --> 1:00:01.096
that brought on the furies.

1:00:03.734 --> 1:00:07.970
- Your vivid depictions
loosen the memory.

1:00:10.674 --> 1:00:12.507
Though the years
have not been kind.

1:00:14.311 --> 1:00:17.679
But Sergeant Mills here,
along with other cavalrymen,

1:00:17.681 --> 1:00:19.982
was hired to assist
in the suppression

1:00:19.984 --> 1:00:22.017
of a renegade
colony of ex-slaves.

1:00:22.019 --> 1:00:25.654
Now I am sorry if acting
with accord of your duty

1:00:25.656 --> 1:00:27.856
has caused you some
personal regret.

1:00:28.959 --> 1:00:32.494
But it has been a
day of some exertion

1:00:32.496 --> 1:00:34.162
and I'll be taking my leave.

1:00:34.164 --> 1:00:35.063
- Don't you even.

1:00:36.567 --> 1:00:38.500
- Just cool them heels.

1:00:38.502 --> 1:00:39.935
- Calling me out?

1:00:40.771 --> 1:00:41.670
- Here we go.

1:00:43.140 --> 1:00:46.942
- I'm calling you a
lower than scum murderer

1:00:46.944 --> 1:00:49.311
of helpless women and children.

1:00:50.447 --> 1:00:52.247
I'm not calling you out.

1:00:52.249 --> 1:00:54.950
As sorry as I feel for
the people of Beacon's,

1:00:56.053 --> 1:00:58.787
I have no intention of
rushing to join 'em.

1:01:01.492 --> 1:01:03.325
I just needed to say my part.

1:01:04.628 --> 1:01:09.564
Quincy Hollis Foster
is a child killer.

1:01:10.601 --> 1:01:13.168
And with that, I take my leave.

1:01:18.942 --> 1:01:19.808
- Hold!

1:01:21.045 --> 1:01:23.879
- Come on, partner,
let it roll off.

1:01:23.881 --> 1:01:26.181
- You gonna force me to draw?

1:01:26.183 --> 1:01:27.883
- Your call to play, Sergeant.

1:01:28.852 --> 1:01:30.118
I've come to purpose.

1:01:33.624 --> 1:01:34.556
- [Sergeant] If
you're gonna shoot me,

1:01:34.558 --> 1:01:35.991
it'll have to be in the back.

1:01:37.594 --> 1:01:38.694
- Quincy!

1:01:38.696 --> 1:01:41.029
(gun fires)

1:01:41.031 --> 1:01:42.531
- Look at me!

1:01:42.533 --> 1:01:44.132
Open your eyes and take sight!

1:01:45.703 --> 1:01:47.536
(groaning)

1:01:47.538 --> 1:01:49.204
As all of you can attest to,

1:01:50.541 --> 1:01:52.808
I did not stab this
man in the back!

1:01:55.713 --> 1:02:00.782
¶ Bury me not on
the lone prairie ¶

1:02:02.052 --> 1:02:07.122
¶ I thought I heard
a mournful sound ¶

1:02:10.894 --> 1:02:15.297
¶ Among the groans
still lower down ¶

1:02:16.800 --> 1:02:19.601
(Royce groaning)

1:02:19.603 --> 1:02:24.106
¶ That awful sight
no tongue can tell ¶

1:02:30.514 --> 1:02:35.584
¶ Is this, the place
called Drunkard's Hell ¶

1:02:40.090 --> 1:02:42.190
- Christ, woman,
that's depressing.

1:02:42.192 --> 1:02:44.326
- (laughs) Oh.

1:02:47.865 --> 1:02:50.065
Pretty fuckin' lamentable.

1:02:50.901 --> 1:02:52.134
You and me tangled here

1:02:52.136 --> 1:02:54.669
like a couple of hogs
awaiting slaughter.

1:02:57.307 --> 1:02:58.206
- Yeah.

1:03:00.878 --> 1:03:03.044
(groans)

1:03:03.947 --> 1:03:05.113
- Hey, Royce.

1:03:08.819 --> 1:03:10.919
We ain't getting out
of this one, are we?

1:03:14.024 --> 1:03:15.657
- I don't think so.

1:03:26.036 --> 1:03:27.302
- (sighs) The evening progresses

1:03:27.304 --> 1:03:29.571
and still we find you troubled.

1:03:29.573 --> 1:03:30.806
- What are you about, old man?

1:03:30.808 --> 1:03:32.040
You should know better

1:03:32.042 --> 1:03:33.642
than to sneak up on
a man in the dark.

1:03:33.644 --> 1:03:34.843
- My apologies, sir.

1:03:34.845 --> 1:03:37.312
I simply thought you
might like some company.

1:03:37.314 --> 1:03:39.714
- You know, most people
that track off by themselves

1:03:39.716 --> 1:03:41.516
are trying to avoid it.

1:03:41.518 --> 1:03:44.286
- Still, after the
horrific incident

1:03:44.288 --> 1:03:46.388
that took place back
there, your friend.

1:03:46.390 --> 1:03:47.989
- Hardly my friend.

1:03:47.991 --> 1:03:49.224
Hired me as a guide

1:03:49.226 --> 1:03:50.859
and the sooner I get
him where he's going,

1:03:50.861 --> 1:03:53.628
the sooner I never have
to set eyes on him again.

1:03:54.731 --> 1:03:56.731
- And where is it
that you are headed?

1:03:56.733 --> 1:04:00.902
- For your sake as well as
mine, I'll avoid an answer.

1:04:00.904 --> 1:04:03.271
- Naturally, wherever a
man like that is headed

1:04:03.273 --> 1:04:05.173
is a place best avoided.

1:04:05.175 --> 1:04:07.375
- I thought someday
he'd meet up with a man

1:04:07.377 --> 1:04:10.412
that was faster and colder,

1:04:12.249 --> 1:04:13.815
give him his just desserts.

1:04:15.419 --> 1:04:18.153
I thought there was such a
man at the end of our journey

1:04:18.155 --> 1:04:21.456
but I think even Royce
Tullis'll find himself wanting

1:04:21.458 --> 1:04:23.725
when he squares up with Quincy.

1:04:23.727 --> 1:04:25.193
- Royce Tullis, you say?

1:04:25.195 --> 1:04:26.695
- Need to keep that
under your hat.

1:04:26.697 --> 1:04:29.531
- As you say, but I do
believe he's the fellow

1:04:29.533 --> 1:04:32.701
I had the misfortune of
encountering a day past.

1:04:32.703 --> 1:04:36.037
Was traveling with a good
woman, two fellows, and a child.

1:04:37.074 --> 1:04:38.807
- Where'd this
crossing take place?

1:04:38.809 --> 1:04:40.709
- On the road from Stark Ridge.

1:04:40.711 --> 1:04:43.712
My companion tried to assist
the child in their company

1:04:43.714 --> 1:04:45.146
and they cut him down.

1:04:45.148 --> 1:04:47.582
- Stark's only a ride
and a bed from here.

1:04:47.584 --> 1:04:49.751
Chances are he's
not there by now.

1:04:49.753 --> 1:04:53.355
Couldn't have traveled far,
doubling back by Creekside.

1:04:53.357 --> 1:04:54.689
Don't say a word of this

1:04:54.691 --> 1:04:56.858
to anybody you
hadn't already told.

1:05:12.542 --> 1:05:15.043
(Ruth gasps)

1:05:16.446 --> 1:05:17.512
- Sorry, ma'am.

1:05:18.415 --> 1:05:19.648
- No need.

1:05:19.650 --> 1:05:21.249
But it is time you wake.

1:05:21.251 --> 1:05:24.152
Father Noah has called
an assembly at the church

1:05:24.154 --> 1:05:26.821
and the entire community
is obliged to attend.

1:05:27.658 --> 1:05:28.890
- What's happening?

1:05:28.892 --> 1:05:31.826
- The trial of your
companions, of course.

1:05:34.598 --> 1:05:37.232
(bell ringing)

1:05:40.437 --> 1:05:42.003
- And you must be Ruth.

1:05:42.005 --> 1:05:44.606
I'm Liam and this is
my sister Margaret.

1:05:44.608 --> 1:05:45.774
- Is it true?

1:05:45.776 --> 1:05:48.209
You were taken
prisoner by savages?

1:05:48.211 --> 1:05:49.311
- Come now.
- Sorry.

1:06:04.461 --> 1:06:07.362
(chains rattling)

1:06:15.539 --> 1:06:17.105
- Hold strong, son.

1:06:17.107 --> 1:06:18.573
Show no debility.

1:06:18.575 --> 1:06:22.010
- The accused will refrain from
talking amongst themselves.

1:06:24.047 --> 1:06:26.648
I recite from the
book of Genesis.

1:06:26.650 --> 1:06:30.986
"Now the earth was corrupt
in the sight of God

1:06:32.055 --> 1:06:35.890
"and the earth was
filled with violence."

1:06:37.627 --> 1:06:40.729
This is the word of the Lord

1:06:42.466 --> 1:06:47.535
and just as salvation was
granted to Noah and his family,

1:06:49.206 --> 1:06:54.275
so too has the Lord seen us
fit for our own sanctuary.

1:06:58.615 --> 1:07:02.550
But once again,
brothers and sisters,

1:07:02.552 --> 1:07:06.388
the agents of the devil
have found our sanctum.

1:07:07.958 --> 1:07:12.794
Of all of those who
have stumbled upon
our ark in the past,

1:07:15.866 --> 1:07:20.201
never has there been
such wretched creatures

1:07:20.203 --> 1:07:24.472
as the ones that stand
before you today.

1:07:24.474 --> 1:07:26.141
Royce Tullis,

1:07:27.477 --> 1:07:31.246
a heathen paramount in
sin, more beast than man,

1:07:32.516 --> 1:07:35.250
and then he gorges
himself drunk on the blood

1:07:35.252 --> 1:07:38.553
of any who would oppose him.

1:07:38.555 --> 1:07:41.156
What say you, Mr. Tullis?

1:07:41.158 --> 1:07:42.357
Confess.

1:07:43.493 --> 1:07:47.295
Seek his salvation, Mr. Tullis.

1:07:47.297 --> 1:07:50.165
It is the Lord Jesus Christ

1:07:50.167 --> 1:07:53.101
who teaches us compassion
and forgiveness.

1:07:53.103 --> 1:07:56.905
He tells us of the
repentant sinner that may,

1:07:56.907 --> 1:08:01.976
only by the grace of
God's mercy, yet be saved.

1:08:03.513 --> 1:08:06.981
- Sir, I wish for absolution.

1:08:06.983 --> 1:08:08.049
- Cyrus!

1:08:08.051 --> 1:08:09.784
- Restrain yourself, Mr. Tullis.

1:08:09.786 --> 1:08:10.685
- I will not!

1:08:12.122 --> 1:08:15.256
A morbid game is all this is.

1:08:15.258 --> 1:08:18.159
Probably the way this
old pecker gets firm.

1:08:18.161 --> 1:08:19.561
- Speak up, young man.

1:08:20.697 --> 1:08:21.930
Do you wish to confess?

1:08:25.302 --> 1:08:26.201
- As do I.

1:08:34.911 --> 1:08:37.378
- This is a glorious news.

1:08:38.482 --> 1:08:42.517
For what sins do
you seek atonement?

1:08:46.389 --> 1:08:48.623
- Well, as been said, sir,

1:08:51.728 --> 1:08:53.328
I've done a whole heap of evil.

1:08:55.332 --> 1:08:57.098
Kinda hard to know
where to begin.

1:08:58.401 --> 1:09:00.268
- Have you murdered?

1:09:01.204 --> 1:09:02.036
- I have.

1:09:02.038 --> 1:09:03.805
- Have you stolen?

1:09:04.808 --> 1:09:05.707
- [Cyrus] Yeah.

1:09:07.177 --> 1:09:09.744
- Have you spoke falsely?

1:09:09.746 --> 1:09:11.279
- Many time.

1:09:11.281 --> 1:09:13.648
- Do you speak falsely now?

1:09:15.152 --> 1:09:16.050
- No, sir.

1:09:17.487 --> 1:09:19.254
It is the Lord's truth.

1:09:22.192 --> 1:09:23.091
- And you.

1:09:24.661 --> 1:09:26.794
- Same as Cyrus.

1:09:29.199 --> 1:09:30.865
And more.

1:09:33.336 --> 1:09:34.235
- I see.

1:09:35.605 --> 1:09:39.340
Would that I could
absolve you myself

1:09:40.877 --> 1:09:44.779
but alas, only God can judge

1:09:46.383 --> 1:09:51.452
whether your confession
warrants forgiveness.

1:09:52.956 --> 1:09:54.189
- What's that mean?

1:09:56.159 --> 1:09:58.259
(gasps)

1:09:58.261 --> 1:09:59.594
- [Royce] Damn fool!

1:09:59.596 --> 1:10:01.596
- So what happens next?

1:10:02.499 --> 1:10:03.865
- [Royce] Cyrus!

1:10:23.153 --> 1:10:24.319
- Tullis's handiwork?

1:10:24.321 --> 1:10:26.321
- That's that
feather's dead mute.

1:10:30.794 --> 1:10:33.194
Look, the tracks are going west.

1:10:33.196 --> 1:10:34.596
- Why would he
venture off trail?

1:10:34.598 --> 1:10:36.297
- Well, I don't
know, but he did.

1:10:39.102 --> 1:10:42.770
- Fear not, for you confessed.

1:10:42.772 --> 1:10:45.807
- Please, please,
no, no, no, no.

1:10:45.809 --> 1:10:47.308
No, please, no, no, no, no.

1:10:47.310 --> 1:10:49.277
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:10:57.153 --> 1:11:00.054
(horses neighing)

1:11:04.194 --> 1:11:06.594
(screaming)

1:11:18.408 --> 1:11:21.009
(Ruth gasping)

1:11:33.990 --> 1:11:35.223
- I'm sorry.

1:11:35.225 --> 1:11:37.292
I've got no money, I'm
just taking what I need.

1:11:37.294 --> 1:11:39.327
- Be needing a fast
horse as well then?

1:11:39.329 --> 1:11:40.561
- Anything will suffice.

1:11:40.563 --> 1:11:42.263
I'm told that Stark
Ridge is just up north.

1:11:42.265 --> 1:11:44.632
- Not only did
Father take you in

1:11:44.634 --> 1:11:47.769
but he passed the
Lord's credence on
those that wronged you.

1:11:47.771 --> 1:11:49.137
- I just can't stay,

1:11:49.139 --> 1:11:50.571
after seeing what
they did to them.

1:11:50.573 --> 1:11:51.839
- But you are not to blame.

1:11:51.841 --> 1:11:54.242
Any child born into the
darkness of this world

1:11:54.244 --> 1:11:56.744
will cast off the
radiance we offered her.

1:11:57.614 --> 1:11:58.613
- Goodbye, Abigail.

1:12:01.651 --> 1:12:02.617
(smacks)

1:12:02.619 --> 1:12:04.252
(screaming)

1:12:04.254 --> 1:12:08.356
¶ Won't you spare me over ¶

1:12:08.358 --> 1:12:11.426
¶ Till another year ¶

1:12:12.495 --> 1:12:13.394
- Samson!

1:12:18.835 --> 1:12:19.934
- Trespasser!

1:12:21.071 --> 1:12:24.439
Deliver me, Lord,
from every evil!

1:12:24.441 --> 1:12:26.808
(gun fires)

1:12:49.699 --> 1:12:52.767
Though I walk through the valley

1:12:52.769 --> 1:12:54.302
of the shadow of
death, I will fear...

1:12:54.304 --> 1:12:55.803
- It's always Psalms.

1:12:58.942 --> 1:13:01.976
(gun fires)

1:13:01.978 --> 1:13:03.244
- Girl, can you hear me?

1:13:04.147 --> 1:13:05.546
- She's done, leave her.

1:13:05.548 --> 1:13:07.515
- She's not and I won't.

1:13:08.885 --> 1:13:10.184
- Welcome, strangers.

1:13:11.755 --> 1:13:14.722
(laughs) There's no need
to bark thunder, friend.

1:13:14.724 --> 1:13:17.525
We're just here to
bid you welcome.

1:13:17.527 --> 1:13:18.426
- Welcome?

1:13:19.462 --> 1:13:20.995
Where are we exactly?

1:13:20.997 --> 1:13:25.400
- We call this
place Eminence Hill.

1:13:25.402 --> 1:13:28.669
We are a small community
of the faithful,

1:13:28.671 --> 1:13:33.141
put down in a territory full
of lawlessness and violence.

1:13:33.143 --> 1:13:38.212
We find that our best defense
is casting a small shadow.

1:13:39.416 --> 1:13:41.816
I'm called Father Noah.

1:13:45.555 --> 1:13:46.587
(gun clicks)

1:13:46.589 --> 1:13:47.822
- US Marshal Foster.

1:13:50.026 --> 1:13:52.860
- I'm happy to know you

1:13:52.862 --> 1:13:57.165
but I'm saddened to see that
one of our flock has fallen.

1:13:58.535 --> 1:13:59.467
What happened?

1:14:00.437 --> 1:14:01.869
- I shot her.

1:14:01.871 --> 1:14:03.538
- Why?

1:14:03.540 --> 1:14:06.340
- [Carson] That woman damn
near killed this here child.

1:14:07.510 --> 1:14:08.476
- I see.

1:14:09.579 --> 1:14:13.514
So it was all in the
line of duty, huh?

1:14:13.516 --> 1:14:14.949
- We're on the trail
of some bandits,

1:14:14.951 --> 1:14:16.384
tracks led us here.

1:14:16.386 --> 1:14:19.220
Any help you proffer
would be justly rewarded.

1:14:27.897 --> 1:14:28.796
- Royce?

1:14:29.732 --> 1:14:30.631
Hey, Royce?

1:14:32.402 --> 1:14:33.301
- What?

1:14:34.471 --> 1:14:35.670
- We need a plan.

1:14:37.040 --> 1:14:37.972
You hear me?

1:14:40.810 --> 1:14:42.643
You're always so good at that.

1:14:49.319 --> 1:14:51.686
- Remove any notion of
walking away from this.

1:14:54.524 --> 1:14:56.991
So I've resigned myself
to the fate that awaits.

1:15:01.498 --> 1:15:03.631
But I'm not going out
like Cyrus and Sam.

1:15:08.004 --> 1:15:09.470
And not that I have
much of one left in me,

1:15:09.472 --> 1:15:11.639
but I'm putting up a
fight, come what may.

1:15:14.744 --> 1:15:15.776
I just hope I can take
at least one of 'em

1:15:15.778 --> 1:15:16.811
before they get me.

1:15:25.588 --> 1:15:26.521
- Royce.

1:15:32.896 --> 1:15:34.729
I don't think I'm ready to die.

1:15:40.069 --> 1:15:41.569
- No one ever is.

1:15:43.673 --> 1:15:47.808
- I suppose it's customary
where you're from

1:15:47.810 --> 1:15:52.880
to offer a spirit but we in
Eminence Hill never partake.

1:15:54.751 --> 1:15:55.650
- Nor do I.

1:15:56.419 --> 1:15:57.318
- Ah.

1:15:58.454 --> 1:16:01.455
I was beginning to think
no man beyond this town

1:16:01.457 --> 1:16:04.358
knew the value of a clear mind.

1:16:06.930 --> 1:16:10.064
Oh, Sister Wilhelmina.

1:16:10.066 --> 1:16:12.033
You've outdone yourself again.

1:16:16.573 --> 1:16:17.805
- Gashes are deep.

1:16:19.042 --> 1:16:20.708
Wounds won't close on their own.

1:16:21.844 --> 1:16:23.311
- Athaliah, would you be so kind

1:16:23.313 --> 1:16:24.812
as to bring a needle and thread

1:16:24.814 --> 1:16:26.681
and some fresh
water from the well?

1:16:27.684 --> 1:16:28.916
- Yes, Brother.

1:16:32.355 --> 1:16:37.425
- So Marshal, tell me about
these men you're chasing.

1:16:39.095 --> 1:16:40.394
- Let's move forward.

1:16:41.798 --> 1:16:44.966
I'm going to assume you know
exactly who it is I speak of

1:16:44.968 --> 1:16:46.734
and for reasons of your own,

1:16:46.736 --> 1:16:48.970
you have sought to delay me.

1:16:48.972 --> 1:16:50.938
- You're a very perceptive man.

1:16:52.642 --> 1:16:54.175
- Well.

1:16:54.177 --> 1:16:58.079
- I'd suggest you eat your
roast before it goes cold.

1:16:59.148 --> 1:17:00.815
But if swine's
not to your taste,

1:17:00.817 --> 1:17:04.218
I can have Sister Wilhelmina
fix you something else.

1:17:04.220 --> 1:17:05.753
- Royce Tullis.

1:17:07.390 --> 1:17:08.289
Where is he?

1:17:09.092 --> 1:17:10.324
Traveling with three others,

1:17:10.326 --> 1:17:12.960
among them likely a
girl, not yet a woman,

1:17:12.962 --> 1:17:16.197
who was taken captive by Mr.
Tullis not farther in years

1:17:16.199 --> 1:17:18.633
than the child my
associate now tends to.

1:17:20.336 --> 1:17:21.702
- We've offended you

1:17:22.805 --> 1:17:26.307
and for that, I ask
your forgiveness.

1:17:26.309 --> 1:17:28.476
But let me put your mind at ease

1:17:28.478 --> 1:17:31.646
in the case of Mr.
Tullis and his brigands.

1:17:32.615 --> 1:17:34.215
We have it well in hand.

1:17:36.419 --> 1:17:37.852
- This is growing tiresome.

1:17:54.003 --> 1:17:58.706
They say that poison
is a woman's weapon.

1:18:03.346 --> 1:18:04.412
Or a coward's.

1:18:09.452 --> 1:18:10.551
(shouts)

1:18:10.553 --> 1:18:12.953
(gun fires)

1:18:17.627 --> 1:18:18.926
Watch carefully now.

1:18:25.501 --> 1:18:27.968
It's a painful way
to die, gut shot.

1:18:27.970 --> 1:18:28.869
Slow to be sure.

1:18:31.074 --> 1:18:34.909
But it can always be made
worse with helping along.

1:18:34.911 --> 1:18:37.078
(Noah groaning)

1:18:37.080 --> 1:18:38.612
Where are they?

1:18:39.449 --> 1:18:40.347
Tell me!

1:18:41.651 --> 1:18:43.884
(screams)

1:18:45.021 --> 1:18:46.487
(gun fires)

1:18:46.489 --> 1:18:49.290
(Quincy gasping)

1:19:01.704 --> 1:19:04.238
(gun clicks)

1:19:04.240 --> 1:19:06.407
(grunts)

1:19:09.312 --> 1:19:11.812
(neck snaps)

1:19:14.117 --> 1:19:17.618
- Sorry, darlin', I don't
think we're welcomed here.

1:19:22.225 --> 1:19:24.425
Where'd those damn
horses get to?

1:19:25.962 --> 1:19:28.462
(gun clicks)

1:19:28.464 --> 1:19:31.065
You gonna cry out so
those people come running?

1:19:33.102 --> 1:19:34.301
You gonna hold quiet?

1:19:37.039 --> 1:19:38.005
Good girl.

1:19:41.177 --> 1:19:42.109
Where's the stables?

1:19:42.111 --> 1:19:44.245
I'm gonna need another horse.

1:19:48.618 --> 1:19:49.517
Much obliged.

1:19:51.687 --> 1:19:54.088
(dramatic music)

1:19:54.090 --> 1:19:56.824
(Quincy groans)

1:20:05.334 --> 1:20:06.700
- [William] Heaven help us.

1:20:08.638 --> 1:20:12.907
- Find Nathan and Rufus
and tell all the people

1:20:12.909 --> 1:20:16.310
to go to their homes
and not come out

1:20:16.312 --> 1:20:18.312
until we give the signal.

1:20:18.314 --> 1:20:20.114
- I'll not leave you.

1:20:20.116 --> 1:20:21.382
- No, you must.

1:20:22.952 --> 1:20:23.784
No, you...

1:20:30.393 --> 1:20:33.227
(dramatic music)

1:20:34.096 --> 1:20:36.497
(gun fires)

1:20:38.768 --> 1:20:39.667
William!

1:20:42.405 --> 1:20:43.304
William!

1:20:48.411 --> 1:20:49.443
- Stupid boy.

1:20:52.815 --> 1:20:54.315
Kid's gone, so are you.

1:20:57.253 --> 1:20:59.186
You can save the rest
of these good folks.

1:20:59.188 --> 1:21:00.821
Tell me where you got Tullis.

1:21:02.625 --> 1:21:04.758
- (laughs) My people
ain't afraid to die.

1:21:06.195 --> 1:21:07.528
(bell ringing)

1:21:07.530 --> 1:21:10.164
There's a better
world waiting for 'em.

1:21:14.804 --> 1:21:17.338
(guns firing)

1:21:21.711 --> 1:21:24.511
(horses snorting)

1:21:36.926 --> 1:21:38.225
- You gonna be all right?

1:21:39.829 --> 1:21:41.595
I'm gonna go find
us some saddles.

1:21:50.506 --> 1:21:52.172
- Hey, who's that there?

1:21:54.076 --> 1:21:54.975
- Royce?

1:21:56.212 --> 1:21:57.378
- Carson Garret.

1:21:58.614 --> 1:22:00.948
No words for my astonishment
finding you here.

1:22:00.950 --> 1:22:03.751
- What the hell'd
they do to you?

1:22:03.753 --> 1:22:05.185
- Guess I'd be hoping too much

1:22:05.187 --> 1:22:06.720
if you were here
to spring us loose.

1:22:12.428 --> 1:22:14.995
(guns firing)

1:22:23.706 --> 1:22:26.907
Come now, Garret, see
reason if not charity.

1:22:26.909 --> 1:22:29.310
Name your price,
spring us loose.

1:22:29.312 --> 1:22:31.478
- I ride with the law now.

1:22:31.480 --> 1:22:33.681
Ain't much different
from riding with you

1:22:34.517 --> 1:22:36.183
but I'm bound to it.

1:22:36.185 --> 1:22:38.252
- You don't know these folks.

1:22:38.254 --> 1:22:41.388
They murdered Cy
and young Samson.

1:22:41.390 --> 1:22:43.657
They tore them apart
from limb to limb.

1:22:43.659 --> 1:22:45.392
Whatever you want to
pin on me, I'll wear it,

1:22:45.394 --> 1:22:47.695
but no man deserves
to die like that.

1:22:50.800 --> 1:22:53.367
(guns firing)

1:23:09.452 --> 1:23:12.820
This lawman you ride
with, anybody I know?

1:23:13.723 --> 1:23:15.089
- Quincy Foster.

1:23:15.091 --> 1:23:16.991
(Gretchen laughs)

1:23:16.993 --> 1:23:18.659
- Foster?

1:23:18.661 --> 1:23:20.527
That's who they sent after me?

1:23:20.529 --> 1:23:21.762
Ain't no lawman.

1:23:21.764 --> 1:23:23.597
He's a damn killer.

1:23:23.599 --> 1:23:24.798
The only thing you're
gonna get from him

1:23:24.800 --> 1:23:27.868
is a back full of
lead as he makes sure,

1:23:27.870 --> 1:23:30.337
damn sure, come
hell or hard rain,

1:23:31.374 --> 1:23:33.173
that he's the only
swinging dick left alive

1:23:33.175 --> 1:23:34.742
to tell the story.

1:23:34.744 --> 1:23:38.212
You spring us loose,
I'll be saving your life.

1:23:38.214 --> 1:23:42.149
You and me may not
have always seen common

1:23:42.151 --> 1:23:44.718
but I've never stated
falsely when it counted.

1:23:44.720 --> 1:23:48.889
Cut me loose and I'll
give you my word.

1:23:48.891 --> 1:23:50.190
I won't follow.

1:23:50.192 --> 1:23:51.592
I'll take care of Foster.

1:23:53.162 --> 1:23:55.662
- What if it's him that
gets the better of you?

1:23:56.966 --> 1:23:58.065
- In such an outcome,

1:24:01.737 --> 1:24:03.303
at least you get a head start.

1:24:08.477 --> 1:24:11.278
(guns firing)

1:24:11.280 --> 1:24:13.947
(Noah gasping)

1:24:17.653 --> 1:24:20.621
- [Man] We need to help him!

1:24:20.623 --> 1:24:21.522
No!

1:24:24.160 --> 1:24:25.459
(screaming)

1:24:25.461 --> 1:24:28.028
(guns firing)

1:24:44.246 --> 1:24:45.412
- [Royce] No!

1:24:46.649 --> 1:24:47.548
No, no.

1:24:52.321 --> 1:24:53.554
- What's that?

1:24:55.424 --> 1:24:58.158
You're gonna cry for me, Tullis?

1:24:59.995 --> 1:25:01.528
- You hold quiet, girl.

1:25:10.973 --> 1:25:13.207
(gasping)

1:25:16.045 --> 1:25:18.512
Just you and me, Foster!

1:25:18.514 --> 1:25:20.314
They're all dead now!

1:25:43.873 --> 1:25:45.139
- This one's holding on.

1:25:47.042 --> 1:25:48.575
Would you like the privilege?

1:25:50.012 --> 1:25:50.911
- I would.

1:25:56.318 --> 1:25:59.486
- You're sending
me from this world

1:25:59.488 --> 1:26:01.622
to the arms of the Lord.

1:26:03.225 --> 1:26:05.959
- I think you're in for one
hell of a disappointment.

1:26:09.532 --> 1:26:10.664
Just know this.

1:26:13.302 --> 1:26:14.601
It was all for naught

1:26:15.704 --> 1:26:18.138
because once you're
gone, I swear to you,

1:26:19.675 --> 1:26:21.175
I'm sowing out the hellfire

1:26:21.177 --> 1:26:23.710
and consigning this whole
goddamn place to the ashes.

1:26:26.982 --> 1:26:28.315
- His will be done.

1:26:30.619 --> 1:26:32.753
(gun clicks)

1:26:32.755 --> 1:26:35.155
(gun fires)

1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:46.600
- You've been
wounded, Mr. Tullis.

1:26:49.171 --> 1:26:50.571
It's a shame that our
paths have not crossed

1:26:50.573 --> 1:26:52.873
when you were in better health.

1:26:52.875 --> 1:26:55.509
- You don't appear to be in
the best of sorts either.

1:26:56.412 --> 1:26:58.278
- Just a scrape.

1:26:58.280 --> 1:26:59.179
- Same here.

1:27:00.950 --> 1:27:02.216
I'm still just standing.

1:27:05.654 --> 1:27:06.987
Just to make things fair.

1:27:11.227 --> 1:27:14.061
(dramatic music)

1:27:18.734 --> 1:27:21.301
(guns firing)

1:27:26.208 --> 1:27:29.810
(Quincy screaming)

1:27:29.812 --> 1:27:32.546
(Royce gasping)

1:27:41.490 --> 1:27:43.991
Now that's just a misfortune.

1:27:46.528 --> 1:27:47.961
So well, I think it was me,

1:27:49.965 --> 1:27:52.399
I got the better deal in this.

1:27:58.540 --> 1:28:01.541
(Quincy screaming)

1:28:21.397 --> 1:28:23.363
- Godspeed, Mr. Tullis.

1:28:24.633 --> 1:28:26.133
- Yeah, godspeed.

1:28:29.471 --> 1:28:31.938
(gun fires)

1:28:31.940 --> 1:28:34.908
(Quincy screaming)

1:28:52.161 --> 1:28:54.661
(slow music)

1:29:00.269 --> 1:29:01.868
- What weighs so heavy, Garret?

1:29:06.342 --> 1:29:07.474
- You believe in God?

1:29:09.011 --> 1:29:10.911
- Shit, sorry I asked.

1:29:10.913 --> 1:29:11.812
- Truly.

1:29:13.515 --> 1:29:15.048
- I suppose so, of course.

1:29:17.419 --> 1:29:20.887
- You believe he saves
people from their sins?

1:29:26.095 --> 1:29:27.594
- That's what's told to us.

1:29:30.132 --> 1:29:31.865
- I used to have nightmares.

1:29:34.269 --> 1:29:37.838
Things I've seen,
things I've done.

1:29:39.041 --> 1:29:41.742
Used to keep me
up for all hours.

1:29:41.744 --> 1:29:42.642
It was hell.

1:29:43.746 --> 1:29:47.214
Man without rest is
like a wounded animal.

1:29:48.283 --> 1:29:50.217
Makes mistakes and...

1:29:52.888 --> 1:29:53.954
And loses his way.

1:29:57.292 --> 1:29:58.759
Then the nightmares stopped.

1:30:00.162 --> 1:30:03.597
Not that they're replaced
by good things or nothing,

1:30:03.599 --> 1:30:04.898
they just stopped.

1:30:07.136 --> 1:30:09.102
I guess I should be
grateful for that

1:30:10.439 --> 1:30:12.472
but it's like another
piece of me died.

1:30:21.116 --> 1:30:23.216
- Something got awful
in your craw today.

1:30:25.454 --> 1:30:28.188
- Hell, maybe we read too
much into these things.

1:30:29.925 --> 1:30:34.094
Maybe there ain't
no God or devil

1:30:34.096 --> 1:30:39.166
or good or evil and we're
all just walking around,

1:30:40.269 --> 1:30:41.201
trying not to get
eaten by each other.

1:30:44.740 --> 1:30:46.573
Like animals in the wild.

1:30:55.551 --> 1:30:57.818
- Yeah, well, I hope
we're more than beasts.

1:31:03.859 --> 1:31:04.724
- So do I.

1:31:10.799 --> 1:31:13.600
- Are you looking for
some company, big boy?

1:31:13.602 --> 1:31:15.235
- Morning, Henry.

1:31:15.237 --> 1:31:16.470
- Good morning.

1:31:16.472 --> 1:31:18.872
A little hair of
the creature, maybe?

1:31:18.874 --> 1:31:20.307
- Oh, coffee'll suffice.

1:31:35.891 --> 1:31:38.625
(ominous music)

1:31:45.300 --> 1:31:46.199
- Garret.

1:31:50.072 --> 1:31:53.340
- Foster, what the hell
are you doing here?

1:31:53.342 --> 1:31:55.075
- Royce Tullis is dead.

1:31:55.077 --> 1:31:57.344
Others too, as
far as I can tell.

1:31:57.346 --> 1:32:02.349
All that remains is for us
to conclude our business.

1:32:02.351 --> 1:32:03.250
- Oh?

1:32:04.353 --> 1:32:06.319
- Your pardon, Mr. Garret,

1:32:06.321 --> 1:32:09.356
does that no longer hold
an interest for you?

1:32:09.358 --> 1:32:12.926
- You rode all the way
here to secure my pardon.

1:32:14.263 --> 1:32:16.930
I find that a little more
than hard to believe.

1:32:16.932 --> 1:32:19.165
- You'd find your
suspicions well warranted.

1:32:20.335 --> 1:32:23.303
Alas, I have come to
yet another impasse.

1:32:23.305 --> 1:32:26.006
In order for me to
collect my just reward,

1:32:26.008 --> 1:32:28.041
Governor Safford's
office has demanded

1:32:28.043 --> 1:32:30.410
that I deliver them the child.

1:32:30.412 --> 1:32:33.613
Alive preferably, but any
condition will satisfy

1:32:33.615 --> 1:32:35.015
the terms of the contract.

1:32:35.817 --> 1:32:37.083
- She's not here.

1:32:39.454 --> 1:32:40.353
- Where?

1:32:44.760 --> 1:32:46.226
(gasps)

1:32:49.831 --> 1:32:52.832
- I daresay that looks putrid.

1:32:52.834 --> 1:32:55.302
- My health should be of no
concern to you, Mr. Garret.

1:32:55.304 --> 1:32:57.437
- Surprised you haven't
found some doctor,

1:32:57.439 --> 1:32:59.039
lop that off for you.

1:32:59.041 --> 1:33:00.540
- I found one who tried.

1:33:00.542 --> 1:33:01.808
He regretted that effort.

1:33:01.810 --> 1:33:04.244
- It's a hard fate for
a man such as yourself

1:33:04.246 --> 1:33:07.714
to lose use of his shooting paw.

1:33:07.716 --> 1:33:09.082
- The girl, Garret!

1:33:13.121 --> 1:33:14.020
Garret!

1:33:15.023 --> 1:33:16.289
Don't you turn from me!

1:33:21.163 --> 1:33:21.995
Garret!

1:33:21.996 --> 1:33:22.828
Goddamn it, Garret,
don't turn from me

1:33:22.831 --> 1:33:24.064
when I'm talking to you!

1:33:27.869 --> 1:33:30.370
- Foster, this is our goodbye.

1:33:33.976 --> 1:33:34.874
- Foster.

1:33:38.180 --> 1:33:39.813
Can't be.

1:33:39.815 --> 1:33:41.348
Quincy Hollins Foster.

1:33:44.853 --> 1:33:46.252
- I don't know you.

1:33:46.254 --> 1:33:47.621
- Name's McKellips.

1:33:48.757 --> 1:33:49.789
Edward McKellips.

1:33:51.360 --> 1:33:53.026
Brother of the late Thomas.

1:33:54.229 --> 1:33:55.795
Surely you remember him.

1:34:04.106 --> 1:34:05.005
- Yes.

1:34:09.544 --> 1:34:10.510
I remember.

1:34:18.020 --> 1:34:20.487
(slow music)

1:34:40.475 --> 1:34:42.976
(gun firing)

1:34:58.427 --> 1:35:01.094
(upbeat music)

1:35:02.698 --> 1:35:05.365
¶ I'm gonna get me a gun ¶

1:35:05.367 --> 1:35:09.069
¶ I'm gonna get me a gun ¶

1:35:09.071 --> 1:35:13.506
¶ And then I'm gonna kill
someone when I get me a gun ¶

1:35:13.508 --> 1:35:16.209
¶ I'm gonna get me a gun ¶

1:35:16.211 --> 1:35:19.612
¶ I'm gonna get me a gun ¶

1:35:19.614 --> 1:35:24.384
¶ I'm gonna shoot that goddamn
bastard when I get me a gun ¶

1:35:24.386 --> 1:35:27.120
¶ I'm gonna get me a gun ¶

1:35:27.122 --> 1:35:30.490
¶ I'm gonna get me a gun ¶

1:35:30.492 --> 1:35:35.562
¶ I'm gonna kill that goddamn
bastard when I get me a gun ¶

1:35:36.264 --> 1:35:38.732
¶ I'm gonna get me ¶

1:35:38.734 --> 1:35:41.468
¶ I'm gonna get me ¶

1:35:41.470 --> 1:35:44.170
¶ I'm gonna get me ¶

1:35:44.172 --> 1:35:46.773
¶ I'm gonna get me ¶

1:35:46.775 --> 1:35:51.845
¶ I'm gonna take that gun
and stick it up his ass ¶

1:35:53.181 --> 1:35:57.851
¶ And then I'll pull the trigger
when the gun goes blast ¶

1:35:58.920 --> 1:36:02.989
¶ If I committed murder
then I do confess ¶

1:36:04.092 --> 1:36:06.159
¶ But I still got
this here gun ¶

1:36:06.161 --> 1:36:08.194
¶ So y'all clean up this mess ¶

1:36:08.196 --> 1:36:10.764
¶ I'm gonna get me a gun ¶

1:36:10.766 --> 1:36:14.167
¶ I'm gonna get me a gun ¶

1:36:14.169 --> 1:36:18.972
¶ I'm gonna get me,
get me, get me a gun ¶

1:36:18.974 --> 1:36:21.708
¶ I'm gonna get me a gun ¶

1:36:21.710 --> 1:36:24.410
¶ I'm gonna get me a gun ¶

1:36:24.412 --> 1:36:29.482
¶ I'm gonna get me a gun ¶

1:36:30.852 --> 1:36:33.186
¶ To shoot that goddamn shitty ¶

1:36:33.188 --> 1:36:36.089
¶ And grouchy no
good son of a bitch ¶

1:36:36.091 --> 1:36:40.727
¶ Mother of a bastard ¶

1:36:40.729 --> 1:36:43.963
¶ When I get me a gun ¶

1:37:00.482 --> 1:37:05.552
¶ Chilled me right
down to my soul ¶

1:37:06.688 --> 1:37:10.690
¶ Night they put
me in that hole ¶

1:37:21.703 --> 1:37:26.706
¶ Well, I lost my
mind inside that box ¶

1:37:28.043 --> 1:37:33.112
¶ To this day,
the devil knocks ¶

1:37:34.549 --> 1:37:39.619
¶ But this sweet
grave is just for me ¶

1:37:40.722 --> 1:37:44.657
¶ I like the dark
now I can see ¶

1:38:33.208 --> 1:38:38.278
¶ So go ahead and
lay a hand on me ¶

1:38:39.381 --> 1:38:44.384
¶ And I'll return
it broke in three ¶

1:38:45.654 --> 1:38:50.723
¶ I've killed the
damsel in distress ¶

1:38:51.927 --> 1:38:56.596
¶ And just for fun
I wear her dress ¶

1:38:57.766 --> 1:39:01.534
¶ Yeah, just for fun
I wear her dress ¶

1:39:07.042 --> 1:39:12.111
¶ And you'll be
sorry for your sins ¶

1:39:13.381 --> 1:39:17.550
¶ The night the
angry woman wins ¶
