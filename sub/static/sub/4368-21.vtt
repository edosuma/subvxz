(Finch)
Hello.

00:02.878 --> 00:04.678
Hello.

00:04.680 --> 00:07.246
Grace, there's something
you should know about me.

00:07.248 --> 00:09.982
There's nothing you can say
that will make me run away.

00:09.984 --> 00:12.852
(Grace) Harold!
Please, my fiance...

00:12.854 --> 00:14.520
- Do you know where he might--
- I'm sorry.

00:14.522 --> 00:16.989
This is everybody
we pulled out of the water.

00:19.092 --> 00:20.693
(Reese) If we let him
walk out that door,

00:20.695 --> 00:23.562
Decima wins,
Samaritan will go live.

00:23.564 --> 00:25.230
If we're now in a place

00:25.232 --> 00:28.200
where the machine is asking us
to commit murder,

00:28.202 --> 00:30.169
that's a place I can't go.

00:30.171 --> 00:32.737
I'm afraid this is
where I get off.

00:34.792 --> 00:36.045
_

00:36.162 --> 00:38.808
_

00:39.615 --> 00:42.603
_

00:45.566 --> 00:48.030
_

00:48.031 --> 00:51.697
_

00:51.698 --> 00:55.078
_

01:01.032 --> 01:02.833
I said open the register now!

01:02.835 --> 01:05.470
I want the cash!

01:06.738 --> 01:08.772
[Whimpering, register dinging]

01:11.009 --> 01:12.109
Who the hell are you?

01:12.111 --> 01:13.310
Ordinarily, I'd be the chick

01:13.312 --> 01:16.146
kicking
your amateur-hour ass.

01:16.148 --> 01:18.649
Really, Raul?
You covered your face,

01:18.651 --> 01:21.151
but no gloves?
Prints on the door.

01:21.153 --> 01:24.088
The cops will have you
in an hour.

01:24.090 --> 01:27.157
Not smart with Charisse
and a two-year-old at home.

01:27.159 --> 01:29.192
But today...

01:29.194 --> 01:30.793
is your lucky day.

01:32.696 --> 01:34.797
Just drop the gun...

01:34.799 --> 01:36.933
take the diapers
and get the hell outta here.

01:36.935 --> 01:39.169
Your kid's better off
with a father.

01:50.180 --> 01:51.881
You saved our lives.

01:51.883 --> 01:56.452
[Chuckles]
From him? No.

01:56.454 --> 01:57.687
[Barrel clicking]

01:57.689 --> 01:59.588
No.

01:59.590 --> 02:02.191
He wasn't a real threat.

02:02.193 --> 02:04.260
But did you notice
that your security cameras

02:04.262 --> 02:05.661
<i>have been off all afternoon?</i>

02:05.663 --> 02:07.129
<i>I wonder why Ricky here</i>

02:07.131 --> 02:09.131
begged you
to work a shift today.

02:09.133 --> 02:12.268
Two words. Inside job.

02:23.579 --> 02:25.480
For the ice cream.

02:30.686 --> 02:33.088
You didn't need backup
after all.

02:33.090 --> 02:34.589
But for the record,

02:34.591 --> 02:36.624
I'd have just
kneecapped that guy.

02:36.626 --> 02:38.926
Especially if I was
nursing a leg wound.

02:40.228 --> 02:42.769
Okay, first, my leg is fine.

02:42.804 --> 02:44.526
And second, what's with
the tips on field work?

02:44.561 --> 02:45.466
Who died and made you Finch?

02:45.468 --> 02:46.901
Ah... it's the role
I gotta play

02:46.903 --> 02:49.203
until the real one comes back.

02:49.205 --> 02:51.605
And when is that?
It's been over a week.

02:51.607 --> 02:54.208
No... call, no-- no text.

02:54.210 --> 02:55.976
Not even a smoke signal.

02:55.978 --> 02:58.578
Finch will reach out to us
when he's good and ready.

02:58.580 --> 03:00.147
Until then--

03:02.984 --> 03:04.684
Nice to see you, too, John.

03:04.686 --> 03:06.220
Where the hell
did you come from?

03:06.222 --> 03:07.954
El Paso, most recently.

03:07.956 --> 03:10.023
The thing with
the narco-trafficker.

03:10.025 --> 03:12.492
Very relevant,
but not the point.

03:12.494 --> 03:15.061
Take a peek around
that corner, you two.

03:17.164 --> 03:18.698
<i>(Reese)</i>
<i>Ambush.</i>

03:18.700 --> 03:20.333
Who are the party crashers?

03:20.335 --> 03:22.468
Decima trigger teams...
waiting for you

03:22.470 --> 03:24.537
with no less than
six submachine guns

03:24.539 --> 03:28.274
and one honest-to-goodness
Russian RPG-7.

03:28.276 --> 03:31.144
We need to get invisible.
Fast.

03:37.851 --> 03:40.520
Phones and earpieces.
Now.

03:40.522 --> 03:41.654
Streets aren't safe.

03:41.656 --> 03:44.222
Decima's machine is online.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.925
Can see us anywhere
and everywhere

03:45.927 --> 03:47.693
in the five boroughs
of New York City.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.227
(Reese) Samaritan?
You confirmed it?

03:49.229 --> 03:51.730
Our names are on the list,
and Greer is keeping score.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.033
All systems-- cameras, phones,
the GPS in your car

03:54.035 --> 03:56.068
can track us.

03:56.070 --> 03:57.769
So what, Samaritan
can think for itself now?

03:57.771 --> 03:59.737
- It can learn?
- I don't think so.

03:59.739 --> 04:02.740
Right now, all it can do
is watch us and follow.

04:02.742 --> 04:05.710
Just remember-- what our
machine sees, Samaritan sees.

04:05.712 --> 04:07.679
Two gods playing with
the same deck of cards.

04:07.681 --> 04:10.115
Stop.

04:12.218 --> 04:14.719
We need to find another way.

04:21.853 --> 04:23.200
_

04:23.228 --> 04:26.598
Mr. Greer, I'd assumed
the beta test of your system

04:26.600 --> 04:28.265
would be a little more...

04:28.267 --> 04:30.834
professional.

04:30.836 --> 04:33.104
The espresso machine
is on its way.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.639
And I can assure you, Senator,

04:35.641 --> 04:39.410
Samaritan is running
as smooth as a Swiss watch.

04:39.412 --> 04:41.912
How long will it take?

04:41.914 --> 04:44.281
You've had all the city's
domain awareness feeds

04:44.283 --> 04:46.317
for four hours already.

04:46.319 --> 04:49.786
And look
at what those four hours

04:49.788 --> 04:51.989
have already produced.

04:55.192 --> 04:58.194
All probable terrorists
in the city of New York

04:58.196 --> 05:00.363
pinpointed, categorized,

05:00.365 --> 05:03.666
<i>and tracked with</i>
<i>an up-to-the-second GPS.</i>

05:03.668 --> 05:06.068
I can assure you, Senator,

05:06.070 --> 05:08.771
that we will have
a hard target for you soon.

05:08.773 --> 05:10.673
And you'll inform me
when you do?

05:10.675 --> 05:12.475
You will be the first to know.

05:14.345 --> 05:16.112
- Fine.
- Mm.

05:20.851 --> 05:23.452
You know we've gotten
dozens of results already.

05:23.454 --> 05:26.155
Any one of these guys
is practically gift-wrapped.

05:26.157 --> 05:28.257
And we'll deliver.

05:28.259 --> 05:32.194
But not until after
we've located Harold Finch.

05:32.196 --> 05:34.196
Where are we on that?

05:34.198 --> 05:35.798
Samaritan couldn't
find a lead, sir.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.432
He may have skipped town.

05:37.434 --> 05:39.701
Should we consider
turning on its higher,

05:39.703 --> 05:41.537
more cognitive functions?

05:41.539 --> 05:43.772
This thing has a mind.
Why don't we use it?

05:43.774 --> 05:46.475
For the simple reason
we don't have the hardware.

05:46.477 --> 05:48.109
If it can't find this Finch,

05:48.111 --> 05:50.312
how 'bout the next best thing?

05:50.314 --> 05:52.181
If we have it combine

05:52.183 --> 05:54.582
everything it knows
about Harold Finch

05:54.584 --> 05:58.653
and ask it to find
his closest living connection,

05:58.655 --> 06:01.556
<i>let's see what it</i>
<i>comes up with.</i>

06:04.259 --> 06:07.062
(Root) Hug the wall.
There's a camera up ahead.

06:11.700 --> 06:13.401
We're covered on 23rd Street

06:13.403 --> 06:14.835
by the Flushing Line
elevated tracks.

06:14.837 --> 06:16.637
We make it that far,

06:16.639 --> 06:18.472
and maybe we don't get shot

06:18.474 --> 06:21.242
by the six Decima agents
waiting a block away.

06:21.244 --> 06:23.077
Samaritan 101.

06:23.079 --> 06:24.712
Let's go.

06:31.644 --> 06:33.785
_

06:34.355 --> 06:35.689
Missed one.

06:35.691 --> 06:37.691
Hold here
until the light changes.

06:37.693 --> 06:40.994
The camera angle switches
with oncoming traffic.

06:46.834 --> 06:48.635
Come on!

[Telephone ringing]

06:52.807 --> 06:54.241
<i>(Root)</i>
<i>John.</i>

06:55.776 --> 06:58.177
When that light switches,
we're screwed!

06:58.179 --> 07:00.546
[Ringing] We can't worry about
irrelevant numbers now.

07:00.548 --> 07:02.749
What is it thinking...?
Telling us to lay low

07:02.751 --> 07:05.517
then handing us a new number?

07:05.519 --> 07:07.754
- There's no time!
- This is a life.

07:07.756 --> 07:09.922
And Finch would
tell us to save it.

07:09.924 --> 07:12.458
So you tell your
complicated boss

07:12.460 --> 07:14.526
if it wants me
to step out of danger,

07:14.528 --> 07:16.895
then I need more than
just numbers.

07:16.897 --> 07:19.465
I want a name.

07:22.034 --> 07:25.404
Fine.
She's giving it to me.

07:25.406 --> 07:27.806
I'll tell you on--

07:27.808 --> 07:30.142
- Oh, no.
- What?

07:30.144 --> 07:32.710
Who is it?

Who is she?

07:43.490 --> 07:45.123
Not sure.

07:45.125 --> 07:48.593
Could be family,
a friend, a coworker.

07:50.429 --> 07:52.430

careful with this--

dangerous criminal organization,

You're killing me with that.

It's not safe for you in here.

11:32.668 --> 11:35.369
It's a good point.

Any way to turn
those things off?

a place to rest?

11:53.420 --> 11:54.921
Yeah, all right, come on.

12:06.367 --> 12:10.035
The situation may require
a certain amount of...

12:10.037 --> 12:11.537

It's lousy, but it's warm.

Thank you.

12:19.446 --> 12:21.413

Why would someone
want to hurt me?

12:24.051 --> 12:26.952
I can't tell you what's
going on out there.

12:26.954 --> 12:29.387

The other detectives--
Stills and his partner--

12:32.693 --> 12:35.960
are they always like that?

12:35.962 --> 12:38.230

a little stiff.

Can I help you?

12:53.479 --> 12:55.146
Special Agent Maybank.

12:55.148 --> 12:57.248
There's a woman by the name
of Hendricks here.

12:57.250 --> 12:58.582
I need to take her
into custody.

12:58.584 --> 13:00.251
And you just happen
to know she's here.

13:00.253 --> 13:02.120
I have a warrant.

13:02.122 --> 13:03.821
It's notarized.

13:03.823 --> 13:06.957
That's a cute trick,
but you ain't getting anywhere.

13:10.796 --> 13:12.663
Oh, of course.

13:12.665 --> 13:14.998
We were just about
to question your suspect.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.401
I had a feeling she was
tied to something bigger.

13:17.403 --> 13:19.403
Now, if you like,
I can bring her to you

13:19.405 --> 13:20.638

13:20.640 --> 13:22.239
- Please.
- Sure.

13:22.241 --> 13:24.407
Right this way.

13:44.362 --> 13:47.697
Picked her up with
two unregistered weapons.

13:54.004 --> 13:55.438
Hate to crash the party,

13:55.440 --> 13:57.707
but a mutual friend
thought I could help in here.

13:57.709 --> 13:59.441
So you got yourself arrested?

13:59.443 --> 14:01.977
Wouldn't be the first time.

14:07.218 --> 14:09.318
there's a coil of copper wire.

14:09.320 --> 14:12.554
In 4-4-3-A, there's a pair
of needle-nosed pliers.

14:12.556 --> 14:14.356
I need them,
a roll of duct tape,

14:14.358 --> 14:16.057

15:41.109 --> 15:42.976
I barely believe
this is a police station.

15:42.978 --> 15:44.777
You're in a situation
you can't control

15:44.779 --> 15:47.013
that's larger
than you can imagine.

15:47.015 --> 15:48.648

16:07.068 --> 16:08.700
An induction coil.

16:08.702 --> 16:10.702
This is the precinct's
telecom box.

The wires from all the cameras
run through this wall.

Each of those wires is protected
by a copper sheath

everything they have at us,

19:18.763 --> 19:21.397
An entire port blacked out

No sign of Grace.

22:14.533 --> 22:16.600

25:24.650 --> 25:26.349
<i>overlooking the street.</i>

25:26.351 --> 25:29.019
Your parents still live there,
don't they?

25:29.021 --> 25:32.255
Charming couple.

25:32.257 --> 25:33.956
Who are you?

25:33.958 --> 25:36.025
You've studied history of art.

25:36.027 --> 25:38.961
Just think of me as...

25:38.963 --> 25:42.031
Michelangelo
in the Sistine Chapel

25:42.033 --> 25:43.966
lying on his back...

25:43.968 --> 25:48.237
trying to paint a portrait
of a rather elusive subject.

25:48.239 --> 25:50.573
Michelangelo painted it
standing up.

25:50.575 --> 25:52.075
Oh?

25:52.077 --> 25:54.577
One of those little things
you learn in art history.

25:54.579 --> 25:57.914
And I can't help you
make a picture of God.

25:57.916 --> 25:59.982
Perhaps you can.

25:59.984 --> 26:01.684
Ever been married?

26:03.853 --> 26:07.055
I'm sure that file of yours
can tell you the answer's no.

26:07.057 --> 26:09.124
Married to your career then?

26:09.126 --> 26:12.761
I'm simply trying to get
a sense of your life

26:12.763 --> 26:14.930
and the people in it.

26:14.932 --> 26:18.066
Mom, dad...
no one else?

26:18.068 --> 26:20.067
Nobody. Friends.

26:20.069 --> 26:22.437
Mostly artists.

26:22.439 --> 26:24.105
Seems a shame...

26:24.107 --> 26:28.075
woman of your beauty,
intelligence,

26:28.077 --> 26:29.510
obvious talent--

26:29.512 --> 26:32.079
I'd think you'd be
quite a catch.

26:34.383 --> 26:37.417
I was engaged once,
four years ago.

26:37.419 --> 26:39.120
But he's dead now.

26:41.890 --> 26:43.924
I'm truly sorry.

26:43.926 --> 26:45.826
How did it happen?

26:47.462 --> 26:49.563
The ferry bombing.

26:51.066 --> 26:52.999
His name was Harold.

26:57.672 --> 27:00.540
How tragic.

27:00.542 --> 27:04.177
Please... tell me
about Harold.

27:14.422 --> 27:16.556
Must be awful
losing a loved one

27:16.558 --> 27:19.825
to an act of terrorism.

27:19.827 --> 27:21.995
I hope his burial provided you

27:21.997 --> 27:24.964
with a modicum of closure.

27:24.966 --> 27:27.967
It was a memorial,
not a burial.

27:27.969 --> 27:29.969
His remains were lost at sea.

27:29.971 --> 27:32.671
And my closure's
none of your business.

27:32.673 --> 27:35.240
Can you name any one thing
about Harold

27:35.242 --> 27:37.843
that you know to be
absolutely true?

27:37.845 --> 27:41.414
I can name dozens.
He was kind, intelligent--

27:41.416 --> 27:43.148
Yes, yes, yes.

27:43.350 --> 27:48.854
Harold Martin,
freelance software engineer.

27:48.856 --> 27:52.857
<i>Orphan with a love of art</i>
<i>and a heart of gold.</i>

27:52.859 --> 27:54.692
<i>So you said.</i>

27:54.694 --> 27:58.296
So he told you.

27:58.298 --> 28:00.732
Are you implying
that Harold lied to me?

28:00.734 --> 28:03.201
I'm implying that your Harold

28:03.203 --> 28:05.837
lived a remarkably
anonymous life...

28:05.839 --> 28:07.505
Perhaps more than one.

28:07.507 --> 28:09.107
What?

28:09.109 --> 28:10.708
Are you out of your mind?

28:10.710 --> 28:12.677
<i>I'm simply trying to discern</i>

28:12.679 --> 28:14.445
whether you're lying to me
about this man

28:14.447 --> 28:16.948
or just to yourself.

28:16.950 --> 28:19.017
I don't know who you are

28:19.019 --> 28:21.119
or how this ends, but...

28:21.121 --> 28:23.054
we're done here.
No more questions.

28:23.056 --> 28:25.989
No more questions about me
and my life or Harold.

28:25.991 --> 28:28.325
No need to lose your temper.

28:28.327 --> 28:31.094
Here's all you need to know
about me, old man.

28:31.096 --> 28:33.397
My dad was an alcoholic.

28:33.399 --> 28:35.866
Nearly tore the family
to pieces.

28:35.868 --> 28:38.169
The thing about
growing up that way--

28:38.171 --> 28:41.638
you get good at spotting lies.

28:41.640 --> 28:47.044
So good that you start
expecting them from everyone.

28:47.046 --> 28:48.378
So how do I know

28:48.380 --> 28:50.947
what Harold told me was true?

28:50.949 --> 28:53.884
Because when he came along,

28:53.886 --> 28:57.720
against every instinct,

28:57.722 --> 29:01.658
I gave him my trust.

29:01.660 --> 29:04.594
Somehow I knew...

29:04.596 --> 29:07.863
he would never break it.

29:07.865 --> 29:11.701
And if you doubt that
even for a second,

29:11.703 --> 29:14.769
you're the one
who's lying to himself.

29:17.307 --> 29:19.675
You truly loved him,
didn't you?

29:19.677 --> 29:23.912
I would have done
anything to save him.

29:23.914 --> 29:26.615
And Harold would have done
anything for me.

29:28.284 --> 29:30.885
Yes.

29:30.887 --> 29:33.621
I have no doubt.

29:33.623 --> 29:35.456
Answer me one question.

29:35.458 --> 29:38.025
Why are you
so interested in Harold?

29:38.027 --> 29:39.893
He's dead.

29:42.531 --> 29:45.966
Your tea's gone cold.

29:45.968 --> 29:48.869
Feel free to freshen it up.

29:53.875 --> 29:56.744
[Gate rumbling]

29:56.746 --> 29:57.978
[Clunk]

30:03.484 --> 30:06.386
Zachary, I finished
our interview with our subject.

30:06.388 --> 30:08.488
Have you found her protectors?

30:08.490 --> 30:11.625
<i>(Zachary) Yes, sir. Samaritan
has located their car.</i>

30:11.627 --> 30:13.393
<i>We're moving in now.</i>

30:17.097 --> 30:20.133
Get out of the car!

30:20.135 --> 30:21.134
Hands up!

30:21.136 --> 30:23.169
Who are you?

30:23.171 --> 30:24.937
How did you get this vehicle?

30:24.939 --> 30:26.305
Easy, man!

30:26.307 --> 30:28.274
I-I just asked for a dollar.

30:28.276 --> 30:30.576
They gave me the keys.

30:32.479 --> 30:34.680
Sir, we lost them.

30:34.682 --> 30:36.182
<i>They engineered a distraction.</i>

30:36.184 --> 30:38.684
Now, why would they
create a distraction

30:38.686 --> 30:42.020
that dragged us all the way
to one side of the city...

30:42.022 --> 30:44.956
unless they were
on their way to the other?

30:44.958 --> 30:47.359
Our location
has been compromised.

30:47.361 --> 30:49.828
Disassemble everything.
Now!

30:58.337 --> 31:01.973
Next time we need to hide from
an all-seeing super computer,

31:01.975 --> 31:03.942
we're getting separate trunks.

31:06.112 --> 31:09.380
My favorite thing
about New York cabbies--

31:09.382 --> 31:11.817
they have terrible memories.

31:11.819 --> 31:13.118
See?

31:14.787 --> 31:17.288
- You forgot us already?
- Yeah, yeah.

31:19.725 --> 31:21.892
(Reese) Decima's holed
up in there somewhere,

31:21.894 --> 31:23.528
and if we're lucky,
so is Grace.

31:23.530 --> 31:25.530
I'm sick of hiding.

31:25.532 --> 31:27.665
Let's make some noise.

31:33.906 --> 31:37.041
(Reese)
Somebody call Tech Support?

31:43.882 --> 31:45.416
Got this one, Shaw.

31:45.418 --> 31:47.351
You find Grace?

31:47.353 --> 31:50.254
Found an interrogation room
set up with tea for two.

31:50.256 --> 31:52.189
Still warm.
We just missed her.

31:52.191 --> 31:53.857
Our friend here
is gonna tell us

31:53.859 --> 31:57.261
everything he knows about Grace
and Samaritan.

31:57.263 --> 32:00.097
Oh, I sincerely doubt that.

32:00.099 --> 32:03.867
Besides... all you need
to know about Ms. Hendricks

32:03.869 --> 32:05.468
is that she's with me,

32:05.470 --> 32:08.872
and for the moment, quite safe.

32:08.874 --> 32:10.774
Let her go.

32:10.776 --> 32:13.944
Or Geek Squad here
catches a bullet.

32:13.946 --> 32:16.112
Amusing performance.

32:16.114 --> 32:18.214
I'm afraid...

32:18.216 --> 32:22.085
<i>Virgil's already dead.</i>

32:22.087 --> 32:23.786
Aren't you, Virgil?

32:30.927 --> 32:35.798
At dawn, Grace Hendricks
will be at the Jefferson Bridge.

32:35.800 --> 32:39.134
I'll be very happy
to return her to you...

32:39.136 --> 32:42.471
in exchange for Harold Finch.

32:42.473 --> 32:44.907
What makes you think
we'd agree to that?

32:44.909 --> 32:47.910
Your agreement is irrelevant.

32:47.912 --> 32:50.312
Get the message
to Mr. Finch.

32:50.314 --> 32:52.780
I expect he'll cooperate.

32:52.782 --> 32:56.418
For Ms. Hendricks' sake,
don't be late.

33:00.256 --> 33:03.625
We can't trade Harold.
We can't even find him.

33:03.627 --> 33:05.260
Then we've only got a few hours

33:05.262 --> 33:07.496
to come up with a way
to save Grace.

33:07.498 --> 33:09.330
[Phone ringing]

33:14.937 --> 33:16.771
- Yep.
<i>(Root) - Hi, you two.</i>

33:16.773 --> 33:18.539
The machine says
the security camera

33:18.541 --> 33:20.474
overlooking the entrance
to Grace's building

33:20.476 --> 33:22.110
just went out.

33:22.112 --> 33:23.377
Thought you should know.

33:23.379 --> 33:24.779
[Dial tone]

33:39.093 --> 33:40.461
(Reese)
Finch.

33:47.501 --> 33:50.037
How did you
take out the camera?

33:50.039 --> 33:52.205
I still have a few tricks left.

33:54.142 --> 33:56.209
I'd hoped maybe
it wasn't too late,

33:56.211 --> 33:58.045
that I could warn her.

34:01.382 --> 34:05.318
They want me, don't they?

34:05.320 --> 34:08.054
(Shaw) We're not giving
you to Decima, Harold.

34:08.056 --> 34:10.056
We just got you back.

34:10.058 --> 34:12.192
The three of us will come up
with some kind of way.

34:12.194 --> 34:14.226
No, any change of plans
would put Grace at risk,

34:14.228 --> 34:16.696
and I can't allow that.

34:16.697 --> 34:19.364
I'll trade myself for her.

34:19.366 --> 34:21.266
The two of you
will stay with me

34:21.268 --> 34:22.735
and make sure that Decima

34:22.737 --> 34:25.571
holds up their end of the deal.
Understood?

34:25.572 --> 34:28.908
Whatever you want, Finch.
We'll be there.

34:31.244 --> 34:33.579
Thank you.

34:41.254 --> 34:43.355
There's one more thing.

34:45.358 --> 34:49.728
I'd like you to avoid
violence if at all possible.

34:49.730 --> 34:51.529
<i>But...</i>

34:51.531 --> 34:56.768
if they harm Grace
in any way...

34:59.071 --> 35:00.538
kill them all.

35:24.046 --> 35:25.347
This is the best plan

35:25.349 --> 35:26.615
you three could come up with?

35:26.617 --> 35:28.717
We had no choice, Lionel.

35:28.719 --> 35:31.685
Well, I don't like it.
We're too exposed.

35:31.687 --> 35:33.087
And there are
cameras everywhere,

35:33.089 --> 35:36.057
which is why we do nothing.

35:36.059 --> 35:39.693
No one fires a shot
unless we have to.

35:45.300 --> 35:48.702
(Reese)
Don't do this,
Harold.

35:48.704 --> 35:52.072
We'll think of something.

35:52.074 --> 35:54.275
We've faced worse.

35:55.810 --> 35:57.944
<i>(Finch)</i>
<i>Worse?</i>

35:59.648 --> 36:02.615
Have we?
I don't think so.

36:02.617 --> 36:06.486
From the day
the machine went online,

36:06.488 --> 36:08.721
part of me knew

36:08.723 --> 36:13.760
that I would never be able
to sever myself from it...

36:13.762 --> 36:15.762
and that anyone
I ever cared about

36:15.764 --> 36:18.198
<i>was in danger.</i>

36:18.200 --> 36:19.932
<i>It was foolish</i>
<i>to imagine otherwise.</i>

36:19.934 --> 36:23.602
I tried to guard myself,
stay hidden,

36:23.604 --> 36:25.737
from the government,
the authorities,

36:25.739 --> 36:29.007
people looking.

36:29.009 --> 36:31.075
Here we still are.

36:32.945 --> 36:34.946
This moment was inevitable.

36:36.882 --> 36:39.518
This moment
was always looking for me.

36:45.891 --> 36:48.960
I have to accept it.

36:54.099 --> 36:56.600
It's for Grace when she's safe.

37:04.776 --> 37:07.311
There was no other way.

37:11.916 --> 37:14.952
Keep yourself alive, Harold.

37:14.954 --> 37:17.654
I'll be coming for you.

37:17.656 --> 37:20.623
Remember what I said.

37:20.625 --> 37:23.060
She's all that matters.

37:27.899 --> 37:31.668
Walk a straight line.
100 paces.

37:31.670 --> 37:35.572
Don't take off the blindfold
until you're all the way there.

38:08.938 --> 38:10.939
Thank you.

38:37.900 --> 38:40.134
[Quietly]
Get her outta here now.

39:20.875 --> 39:24.678
Day like today, it's gotta
feel good to come home.

39:27.647 --> 39:28.881
Hey.

39:28.883 --> 39:30.316
You gonna be okay?

39:30.318 --> 39:32.585
Honestly, I don't know.

39:32.587 --> 39:34.587
Is it gonna be safe here?

39:34.589 --> 39:37.423
(Reese)
No.

39:37.425 --> 39:39.825
They have what they
want for now,

39:39.827 --> 39:43.128
but that won't stop them
from coming after you again.

39:43.130 --> 39:46.499
Which is why
you should open this.

39:46.501 --> 39:49.101
That job you were
looking at in Italy?

39:49.103 --> 39:51.136
You've been selected
for the position.

39:51.138 --> 39:54.540
What? I didn't even
go on the interview.

39:54.542 --> 39:56.542
I was supposed to leave--

39:56.544 --> 39:58.810
Your flight leaves tonight.

39:58.812 --> 40:00.879
The job begins next week.

40:00.881 --> 40:02.947
They'll set you up
with an apartment,

40:02.949 --> 40:05.617
stipend, all under the name
on that passport.

40:08.787 --> 40:11.823
Lionel here will get you
to the airport safely.

40:15.694 --> 40:17.395
It's a good time to start over.

40:20.866 --> 40:23.034
Please don't look back.

40:27.205 --> 40:29.707
Did you know him?

40:29.709 --> 40:31.909
Harold?

40:31.911 --> 40:34.311
Is he what this was all about?

40:40.385 --> 40:43.620
All I know for sure is...

40:43.622 --> 40:46.190
you loved him.

40:46.192 --> 40:48.692
And he loved you back.

41:09.980 --> 41:11.347
<i>(Man)</i>
<i>Step away from the door!</i>

41:11.349 --> 41:14.083
Get on the ground!
Now!

41:14.085 --> 41:16.819
(Greer) Results of the
Samaritan beta test, Senator.

41:16.821 --> 41:19.922
One terrorist, as requested.

41:19.924 --> 41:22.291
<i>His real name</i>

41:22.293 --> 41:24.193
and what he was planning,

41:24.195 --> 41:27.429
should you care to know
the specifics.

41:27.431 --> 41:29.265
Rest assured, I'll get
very well acquainted

41:29.267 --> 41:30.499
with the specifics.

41:32.102 --> 41:35.170
Assuming everything pans out...

41:35.172 --> 41:36.939
I'll be in touch.

41:41.444 --> 41:42.778
So Samaritan's
losing the feeds then?

41:42.780 --> 41:44.413
<i>(Greer)</i>
<i>For the moment.</i>

41:44.415 --> 41:46.615
But we've gained
the Senator's confidence.

41:46.617 --> 41:50.251
And something
far more valuable.

41:50.253 --> 41:51.520
Drive.

41:58.602 --> 42:00.871
_

42:00.981 --> 42:03.971
_

42:04.093 --> 42:05.231
_

42:05.406 --> 42:06.211
_

42:07.702 --> 42:09.904
So what's all the way
out in Mount Vernon

42:09.906 --> 42:11.572
that's so important?

42:11.574 --> 42:14.875
At the time, it was
outside New York City limits

42:14.877 --> 42:16.977
and Samaritan's prying eyes.

42:16.979 --> 42:18.412
At the time?

42:18.414 --> 42:20.614
Decima's lost the feeds.

42:20.616 --> 42:24.985
So for now,
the only one watching is her.

42:24.987 --> 42:28.155
Chin up, kids.
You're not out of the game yet.

42:28.157 --> 42:29.990
Trust me.

42:29.992 --> 42:34.894
We lost Finch,
which means we lost everything.

42:34.896 --> 42:37.331
Not everything.

42:42.571 --> 42:46.840
<i>We now have</i>
<i>seven of Samaritan's servers.</i>

42:46.842 --> 42:49.442
Like I said...

42:49.444 --> 42:51.344
trust me.

42:59.053 --> 43:01.587
You blindfolded her.

43:01.589 --> 43:03.990
I appreciate that.

43:03.992 --> 43:05.792
Least I could do.

43:05.794 --> 43:09.495
Had a feeling
you'd prefer it that way.

43:09.497 --> 43:14.366
And I didn't want to
get off on the wrong foot.

43:14.368 --> 43:17.002
After all...

43:17.004 --> 43:19.705
you've been
a very hard man to find.
