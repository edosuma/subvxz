Previously on <i>Bunheads</i>...

00:01.500 --> 00:03.299
I remember this song being much shorter.

00:03.360 --> 00:04.562
Thank God she's back tomorrow.

00:04.563 --> 00:06.464
Fanny extended her trip.

00:06.465 --> 00:07.799
She's not coming back until next week.

00:07.800 --> 00:10.266
- What?!
- Still no Sasha today.

00:10.267 --> 00:12.803
- I know, missing class.
- Maybe she finally got in trouble.

00:12.804 --> 00:13.670
- We thought you were in military school.
- No, we didn't.

00:13.671 --> 00:15.371
We just thought you got busted.

00:15.372 --> 00:17.407
They gave you a credit
card for being a jerk.

00:17.408 --> 00:18.775
- What did I miss?
- We're talking about Fanny's rules.

00:18.776 --> 00:20.811
Oh, you tell her about walking on sand?

00:20.812 --> 00:22.879
- She has rules for everything.
- Swimming, piano lessons,

00:22.880 --> 00:25.548
- reading... all fine.
- No eating after sundown.

00:25.549 --> 00:27.082
- Avoiding direct sunlight.
- You know you can't even be a minute late

00:27.083 --> 00:29.017
for class... Fanny's rule, not mine.

00:29.018 --> 00:31.787
- Fanny's not here.
- She's not here, but her class is,

00:31.788 --> 00:34.457
her studio is and her
rules sure as hell are.

00:35.325 --> 00:37.092
Another Saturday. Boned.

00:37.093 --> 00:38.627
When are we ever going
to have a weekend off?

00:38.628 --> 00:40.262
When we're 40 and too old to enjoy it.

00:40.263 --> 00:42.464
We have ballet all morning...

00:42.465 --> 00:45.633
and then a fun-filled three-hour
leadership conference at school.

00:45.634 --> 00:47.902
I had to sit through that last year.

00:47.903 --> 00:50.572
A million community leaders
yammering on and on and on.

00:50.573 --> 00:53.174
- Our community has leaders?
- Just wait till you experience

00:53.175 --> 00:54.976
Pete from Pete's pesticides
and his take on punctuality.

00:54.977 --> 00:56.944
It's inspiring.

00:56.945 --> 00:58.278
- Hi, girls.
- Hey.

00:58.279 --> 01:00.914
Boo, what are those for?

01:00.915 --> 01:03.817
They're for madame Fanny.
It's a welcome-back bouquet.

01:03.818 --> 01:05.185
What's wrong?

01:05.186 --> 01:07.187
Those are freeway flowers.

01:07.188 --> 01:10.190
- You can tell?
- They're already turning brown.

01:10.191 --> 01:12.058
And there are more daisies than roses.
That's always a telltale sign.

01:12.059 --> 01:14.694
And all this baby's breath
screams "cheap."

01:14.695 --> 01:16.395
Baby's breath is the curly
parsley of the flower world.

01:16.396 --> 01:18.364
Isn't it the thought that counts?

01:18.365 --> 01:20.099
Remember Kate Hutchins? Little redhead?

01:20.100 --> 01:21.834
She brought freeway flowers one year.

01:21.835 --> 01:23.636
Fanny thanked her, put them in a vase,

01:23.637 --> 01:24.637
then poor little Kate got
pushed farther and farther

01:24.638 --> 01:26.372
to the back of the class.

01:26.373 --> 01:28.673
Till she was all the way
out of the building.

01:28.674 --> 01:30.174
- Then her parents sold their house.
- In a really bad market.

01:33.145 --> 01:35.780
- Hi, everybody.
- Freeway flowers?

01:35.781 --> 01:37.582
- Grocery store.
- Oh.

01:37.583 --> 01:39.283
What?

Oh. Hi.

02:12.783 --> 02:14.417
Well, hello there.

02:14.418 --> 02:16.585
And how are you this fine day?

02:16.586 --> 02:18.053
I'm good. I am very good.

02:18.054 --> 02:19.955
I must say, I am nothing
but good... and you?

02:19.956 --> 02:22.691
- I'm good too.
- Good!

02:22.692 --> 02:24.560
I'm just grabbing some food.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.161
My little kitchen is
still not up and running.

02:26.162 --> 02:27.963
It's not even up and limping.

02:27.964 --> 02:30.131
Ah, damn. Out of cayenne pepper.

02:30.132 --> 02:32.367
My eggs are nothing
without cayenne pepper.

02:32.368 --> 02:34.368
There must be more somewhere.

02:34.369 --> 02:36.537
I have no idea.

02:36.538 --> 02:37.905
I haven't cracked the secret
storage system around here.

02:37.906 --> 02:40.140
Yep, same as always.

02:40.141 --> 02:42.877
Shoves the spices down
behind the sandwich bags.

02:42.878 --> 02:44.812
- Why?
- Yeah, why?

02:44.813 --> 02:45.813
- It's just awkward.
- Very.

02:48.116 --> 02:49.783
Do you know who in the hell I am?

02:49.784 --> 02:51.818
- No.
- I'm Michael.

02:51.819 --> 02:53.787
You must have heard about me.

02:53.788 --> 02:55.855
Only that you rode your boat
ashore, hallelujah.

02:55.856 --> 02:59.292
She said you were funny.

02:59.293 --> 03:01.461
- And quick too... I like that.
- We're talking Fanny, right?

03:01.462 --> 03:03.362
Who else would we be talking about?

03:03.363 --> 03:05.430
- So she's back?
- She sure is.

03:05.431 --> 03:07.032
Okay, catching up here.

03:07.033 --> 03:10.469
Listen... join us for breakfast.

03:10.470 --> 03:12.738
I always make three times
what anybody could eat.

03:12.739 --> 03:14.106
Oh, no, I couldn't... I mean, considering

03:14.107 --> 03:15.373
where you're headed with that tray,

03:15.374 --> 03:16.541
I don't think you want me around.

03:16.542 --> 03:18.443
I'm setting us up in the dining room.

03:18.444 --> 03:20.845
Oh, the dining room. Okay.

03:20.846 --> 03:23.014
That's a terrific place to eat breakfast.

03:23.015 --> 03:24.548
I just thought with the robe
that you were heading

03:24.549 --> 03:26.383
back to Fanny, and that
she was still in bed,

03:26.384 --> 03:27.518
and I was thinking, "what is
this... kinky breakfast day?"

03:27.519 --> 03:28.853
You know?

03:28.854 --> 03:30.989
No, not really.

03:30.990 --> 03:32.790
All three of us having breakfast in bed...

03:32.791 --> 03:34.926
that queen-sized bed up there?

03:34.927 --> 03:36.460
I'm not a prude.
I mean, I've had breakfast

03:36.461 --> 03:39.096
in all kinds of places...
some kinky, some not.

03:39.097 --> 03:40.831
Most of 'em not.
I really don't have kinky breakfasts much.

03:40.832 --> 03:42.933
- Good for you.
- Doesn't get much less kinky

03:42.934 --> 03:43.800
than this.

03:46.938 --> 03:48.471
Have a good one.

03:52.110 --> 03:53.909
You too.

03:56.412 --> 03:58.914
Ginger Rogers was so glamorous.

03:58.915 --> 04:00.950
It's like she's floating, not dancing.

04:00.951 --> 04:03.119
She could talk too. She was funny.

04:03.120 --> 04:05.354
They talked faster back then.
It's funnier when it's faster.

04:05.355 --> 04:07.589
And they would shoot a whole
dance sequence in just one shot.

04:07.590 --> 04:09.457
- No editing.
- Oh, well, hello.

04:09.458 --> 04:12.527
When did Mr. Scorsese get here?

04:12.528 --> 04:14.796
- You know what I mean. - Because
I want him to explain "Kundun" to me.

04:14.797 --> 04:16.865
She's so beautiful too. She exudes sex.

04:16.866 --> 04:19.000
- Yuck!
- Sorry.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.168
That's just what my mom says
when she sees Matt Lauer.

04:20.168 --> 04:22.871
Double yuck!

04:22.872 --> 04:25.139
I used to think that actors
in black and white movies

04:25.140 --> 04:26.640
went home to black and white houses
and lived in black and white worlds.

04:26.641 --> 04:29.009
You sound like a sad Dr. Seuss.

04:29.010 --> 04:30.644
Hey, look. I'm Ginger Rogers.

04:30.645 --> 04:32.412
I thought I was Ginger Rogers.

04:32.413 --> 04:34.081
We can both be Ginger Rogers...

04:34.082 --> 04:37.384
- Are you okay?
- This is a rough business.

04:37.385 --> 04:39.419
You know, Ginger Rogers did everything

04:39.420 --> 04:41.353
that Fred Astaire did,
but she did it backwards.

04:41.354 --> 04:43.189
And in high heels.
Any other brilliant cliches

04:43.190 --> 04:44.691
you'd like to hit us with today, Boo?

04:44.692 --> 04:46.693
A penny saved is a penny earned?

04:46.694 --> 04:48.094
It's not the heat, it's the humidity?

04:48.095 --> 04:50.897
I didn't say I thought it up, Sasha.

04:50.898 --> 04:53.900
So have you and Jordan rehearsed
the Astaire/Rogers thing yet?

04:53.901 --> 04:56.002
A little. We don't
want to rehearse too much.

04:56.003 --> 04:58.103
Trying to keep it fresh.

04:58.104 --> 04:59.304
- Whoa.
- Three whacks.

04:59.305 --> 05:00.706
She's in a mood.

05:12.451 --> 05:14.585
- Let's show 'em some.
- You got it.

06:03.531 --> 06:06.300
- Who needs rehearsal?
- You don't.

06:06.301 --> 06:08.169
- That was great, Jordan.
- I know.

06:08.170 --> 06:09.670
Okay. Let's gather.

06:11.640 --> 06:13.374
Quick, quick, everyone.

06:13.375 --> 06:15.442
Welcome back, madame Fanny.

06:15.443 --> 06:17.510
I'm never gone. I'm always here.

06:17.511 --> 06:20.247
Yes, ma'am. So are we.

06:20.248 --> 06:22.682
Okay, everybody listen up because
we have a lot to catch up on.

06:22.683 --> 06:26.286
As my veterans know, we are
fast approaching show season.

06:26.287 --> 06:28.955
- I love show season.
- Shh!

06:28.956 --> 06:30.991
Summer is our busiest time
for performances.

06:30.992 --> 06:33.092
We have our usuals coming up...

06:33.093 --> 06:34.693
the regional mall tour at the end of July,

06:34.694 --> 06:37.096
the strawberry festival.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.999
The Ventura County arts fair
will be an overnighter,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.101
so I'm going to need
some parents to tag along.

06:42.102 --> 06:44.003
Then it's our Nutcracker
at the end of August.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.671
Why do we do our Nutcracker in August?

06:45.672 --> 06:47.572
Costumes are half-off.

06:47.573 --> 06:49.140
But our first performance of the season

06:49.141 --> 06:52.410
is for the grand opening
of Paradise Gourmet Foods,

06:52.411 --> 06:54.545
and it's a biggie.

06:54.546 --> 06:57.248
They're building a beautiful stage for us

06:57.249 --> 06:59.750
and we're giving them
a full ballet exhibition,

06:59.751 --> 07:02.987
closing with the Astaire/Rogers dance.

07:02.988 --> 07:04.855
Madame Fanny, what about
the Arroyo Grande beach party?

07:04.856 --> 07:06.890
Not happening this year.

07:06.891 --> 07:09.860
Their arts council decided
to go with an exhibition

07:09.861 --> 07:12.029
by the Southern California
cheerleading champs.

07:12.030 --> 07:13.763
To each his own.

07:13.764 --> 07:15.165
That can't be all.

07:15.166 --> 07:16.867
Wait for it...

07:16.868 --> 07:19.036
What the hell does cheerleading

07:19.037 --> 07:20.304
have to do with art?!

07:20.305 --> 07:22.471
And thar she blows.

07:22.472 --> 07:24.340
If cheerleading is art,
then so is yodeling

07:24.341 --> 07:26.175
and plate-spinning.

07:26.176 --> 07:28.344
If those morons at Arroyo Grande

07:28.345 --> 07:30.679
want to see squatty girls
with thick thighs

07:30.680 --> 07:32.614
do their grotesque handstands
and flimsy acrobatics,

07:32.615 --> 07:35.318
then fine! Let 'em!

07:35.319 --> 07:37.652
Their grand finale can be
a chicken pecking out of tune

07:37.653 --> 07:41.323
on a toy piano... that'll wow 'em!

07:41.324 --> 07:43.992
Where was I?

07:43.993 --> 07:47.294
You were talking about the Paradise
Gourmet Food store opening.

07:47.295 --> 07:50.030
Yes, that's in two weeks, and
we have a lot of work to do.

07:50.031 --> 07:52.333
Sasha, what happened here?

07:52.334 --> 07:54.902
- What do you mean?
- Turn around.

07:54.903 --> 07:56.270
You have tan lines.

07:56.271 --> 07:57.905
Yeah, I got a little sun.

07:57.906 --> 07:59.940
I'm not happy about it.

07:59.941 --> 08:02.209
Me neither. It hurts a little.

08:02.210 --> 08:06.112
You know the rules about members
of my class and the sun.

08:06.113 --> 08:08.447
They are not to come
in contact with each other.

08:08.448 --> 08:10.049
It's hard to avoid sometimes.

08:10.050 --> 08:12.118
Walking down the street, yes.

08:12.119 --> 08:14.287
But clearly you were in the sun

08:14.288 --> 08:16.356
in a bathing suit.

08:16.357 --> 08:18.024
Now if I were training you
for a career in radio,

08:18.025 --> 08:20.525
that would be fine.

08:20.526 --> 08:22.394
But dance is a visual medium,
and it's show season!

08:22.395 --> 08:24.629
I'm sorry.

08:24.630 --> 08:26.564
Want to try that again?

08:26.565 --> 08:28.901
I apologize. I'm very sorry.

08:31.037 --> 08:34.273
- Boo?
- Yes?

08:34.274 --> 08:36.307
You're doing the Astaire/Rogers
dance this year.

08:36.308 --> 08:38.042
- What?!
- But Sasha always does it.

08:38.043 --> 08:39.176
She and Jordan are...

08:39.177 --> 08:43.114
Places at the barre.

08:43.115 --> 08:44.782
First position.

08:44.783 --> 08:46.951
Demi, demi, grande.

08:46.952 --> 08:50.121
And demi. And straight.

08:50.122 --> 08:52.255
Demi and straight. And grande.

08:52.312 --> 08:53.312
There she is.

08:54.638 --> 08:56.807
Hey, Fanny. Welcome back.

08:56.808 --> 08:59.242
- Half my plants are dead.
- They look fine to me.

08:59.243 --> 09:00.677
You clearly did nothing to help
the garden while I was gone.

09:00.678 --> 09:02.145
The gardeners were here. They did it all.

09:02.146 --> 09:04.447
The gardeners mow, blow and go.

09:04.448 --> 09:06.216
I didn't catch their names,
but that could be them.

09:06.217 --> 09:07.650
I mean, couldn't you see
they were distressed?

09:07.651 --> 09:10.720
The gardeners or the plants?

09:10.721 --> 09:12.554
- Michelle. - Fanny,
you don't want me touching your plants.

09:12.555 --> 09:14.857
Plants and I have
a history... a bad history.

09:14.858 --> 09:16.892
"The killing fields"? That was me.
I killed those fields.

09:16.893 --> 09:18.894
Well, clearly I'm
going to have to show you

09:18.895 --> 09:20.495
how to deadhead peonies
for the next time I'm gone.

09:20.496 --> 09:22.331
Okay, I can't wait to explore

09:22.332 --> 09:24.332
the exciting world of peony deadheading.

09:24.333 --> 09:27.168
Good. Oh, and I've got
tickets to the matinee

09:27.169 --> 09:29.170
of a play tomorrow in L.A...
I want you to go with me.

09:29.171 --> 09:31.072
In my new role as your spinster daughter?

09:31.073 --> 09:32.707
- Don't be snotty.
- I'm just saying

09:32.708 --> 09:34.976
I'm very busy with my
needlepoint this weekend,

09:34.977 --> 09:36.310
then I was going to use my
quill pen to write a letter

09:36.311 --> 09:38.213
to cousin Henry in Manchester.

09:38.214 --> 09:39.947
I thought you liked theater.
That's why I asked.

09:39.948 --> 09:42.649
I do like theater, but you didn't ask.

09:42.650 --> 09:46.319
Well, sounds like you're free.
I'm paying for the tickets.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.722
The play's supposed to be good, so
what's stopping you from going?

09:48.723 --> 09:52.025
- Me?
- No.

09:52.026 --> 09:54.294
I love theater, and you're not
stopping me from going.

09:54.295 --> 09:56.395
So yes, I will go with you.

09:56.396 --> 09:58.530
Good. It's supposed to be very funny.

09:58.531 --> 10:00.767
It's called "Blank up, it's time."

10:00.768 --> 10:02.068
"Blank up"? What does that mean?

10:02.069 --> 10:04.270
Well, the blank is some vulgar word,

10:04.271 --> 10:05.738
so that's how they have
to print it on the tickets.

10:05.739 --> 10:09.541
"Blank up, it's time"?

10:09.542 --> 10:11.177
Okay, I'm scrolling through my mental list

10:11.178 --> 10:12.911
of filthy words here.

10:12.912 --> 10:15.647
That doesn't make sense.

10:15.648 --> 10:18.283
That's funny, but it doesn't make sense.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.886
I got a lot of filthy stuff
I'm working through here.

10:20.887 --> 10:23.655
- I have no doubt.
- Ooh, getting to the obscure ones now.

10:23.656 --> 10:25.757
Ooh, hello, haven't thought
about you in a while,

10:25.758 --> 10:28.492
you cheeky little devil.

10:28.493 --> 10:30.527
Nope, nothing makes sense with that title.

10:30.528 --> 10:32.462
Well, then... one more reason to go.

10:32.463 --> 10:34.799
You'll be able to solve
the mystery of the title.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.401
So there was no one else
for you to go with?

10:37.402 --> 10:40.037
No special friend?

10:40.038 --> 10:41.972
I took Colleen once

10:41.973 --> 10:43.807
to "The Sound of Music."

10:43.808 --> 10:46.009
She hummed off-key to every song,

10:46.010 --> 10:48.077
then got so confused she ended
up rooting for the Nazis.

10:48.078 --> 10:50.079
No, I meant a special friend.

10:50.080 --> 10:53.582
You know, a cayenne peppery friend?

10:53.583 --> 10:55.819
- You mean Michael?
- Yes, Michael... the man you've been hiding

10:55.820 --> 10:57.086
- from me.
- I wasn't hiding him from you.

10:57.087 --> 10:59.222
Well, you didn't tell me about him.

10:59.223 --> 11:01.023
I didn't tell you about the
marshmallow vodka I bought, either,

11:01.024 --> 11:03.425
but you managed to find that just fine.

11:03.426 --> 11:06.228
- So why isn't he going?
- He'll tag along to musicals,

11:06.229 --> 11:07.729
but he doesn't like straight plays.
He thinks they're boring.

11:07.730 --> 11:10.498
So tell me about him. Who is he?

11:10.499 --> 11:11.733
He's a very good friend of mine.

11:11.734 --> 11:13.368
He was sporting your slippers.

11:13.369 --> 11:15.837
I'd say he's a very good friend.

11:15.838 --> 11:19.440
I've known Michael for...
longer than I want to admit.

11:19.441 --> 11:21.775
He's a pianist, a fine one.

11:21.776 --> 11:23.344
He tours a lot, and
whenever he's in the area

11:23.345 --> 11:25.112
we spend time together.

11:25.113 --> 11:27.849
- He seemed nice.
- He's wonderful.

11:27.850 --> 11:30.451
We keep it casual and it
all works out perfectly.

11:30.452 --> 11:32.752
Wow, very good. I approve.

11:32.753 --> 11:36.223
I wasn't looking for your approval.

11:36.224 --> 11:38.058
So you'll swing by in the afternoon,
and we'll hit the road?

11:38.059 --> 11:40.060
You're driving.

11:40.061 --> 11:41.094
Had an inkling that was the case.

11:44.065 --> 11:48.634
Clarity of purpose,
motivation and teamwork.

11:48.635 --> 11:51.571
Those are the three. So first,
what is clarity of purpose?

11:51.572 --> 11:53.239
- That was stupid.
- We're out, aren't we?

11:53.240 --> 11:55.140
But I think walking backwards out the door

11:55.141 --> 11:56.542
to create the illusion that
we're actually walking in

11:56.543 --> 11:58.611
just drew more attention to us.

11:58.612 --> 11:59.912
Especially when you dropped
all your leadership materials

11:59.913 --> 12:01.714
- and went, "ta-da!"
- I hear no alarms.

12:01.715 --> 12:03.983
I see no search dogs. We're free, ladies.

12:03.984 --> 12:06.150
- Rejoice.
- So what do you wanna do?

12:06.151 --> 12:07.318
We've got a prescription to pick up.

12:07.319 --> 12:08.787
Can't your mom do that for you?

12:08.788 --> 12:10.589
Then I'd never see it again.

12:10.590 --> 12:12.657
- Is the Katy Perry movie still out?
- I'm sorry.

12:12.658 --> 12:15.226
I'm not sitting through that woman
squirting things at me in 3-D.

12:15.227 --> 12:18.229
- There's gotta be something. - Hold on,
I gotta get something outta my locker.

12:18.230 --> 12:20.064
You might want to stand back
a little when you open that.

12:20.065 --> 12:22.800
- Why?
- An enraged Sasha may jump out.

12:22.801 --> 12:25.569
She was Black Swan before
you took her Ginger Rogers.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.438
- Now that makes her Def Con Swan.
- She's got nothing to lose.

12:27.439 --> 12:30.040
I didn't take her Ginger Rogers.
Fanny gave it to me.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.476
Sasha doesn't get too analytical
when it comes to placing blame.

12:32.477 --> 12:34.912
She's a little more result oriented.

12:34.913 --> 12:37.814
- And the result is you got the part.
- But I didn't even ask for it.

12:37.815 --> 12:40.850
We're hanging in the school hallway
on a Saturday. This was not the point.

12:40.851 --> 12:42.084
- We'll meet you outside.
- Okay.

12:55.131 --> 12:56.765
- I do not approve of this.
- Of what?

12:56.766 --> 12:59.968
Of bringing wine into a theater.

12:59.969 --> 13:02.103
- Well, I love getting sloshed at the
theater. - But we're both performers,

13:02.104 --> 13:04.740
so the theater is sacred ground.
This is our church.

13:04.741 --> 13:08.410
Churches have wine. Jesus made it out
of water. Ever hear of it?

13:08.411 --> 13:10.445
I saw "Jesus Christ, Superstar,"
of course I've heard of it.

13:10.446 --> 13:11.612
This is our row. And that's us.

13:11.613 --> 13:14.682
Excuse me.

13:14.683 --> 13:17.184
Pardon me. Thank you.

13:17.185 --> 13:19.887
Excuse me. Those are our seats.

13:19.888 --> 13:23.057
Those are our seats. Excuse me.

13:23.058 --> 13:26.059
Excuse me, excuse me,
I need to get to my seat.

13:26.060 --> 13:28.595
Then you should've gotten here
a little earlier.

13:28.596 --> 13:30.096
Uh, the play hasn't started yet.

13:31.699 --> 13:33.900
- Can you believe this?
- Just squeeze through.

13:33.901 --> 13:36.302
I can't. This woman's built
like the Panama Canal.

13:36.303 --> 13:38.538
- Well, the Panama Canal opens, doesn't it?
- The nerve.

13:38.539 --> 13:40.239
Come on, we're blocking people.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.974
I guess I'll just have to power through.

13:41.975 --> 13:44.042
Coming through here.

13:44.043 --> 13:46.044
Coming through!

13:46.045 --> 13:49.147
Are you kidding me?

13:49.148 --> 13:51.648
- What are you doing?
- Honey, I don't think I'm gonna make it.

13:54.955 --> 13:57.689
Did you see that? I was caught
between that woman's giant legs!

13:57.690 --> 14:00.692
- Keep your voice down.
- Why? Am I being rude?

14:00.693 --> 14:03.561
You're here five minutes and you're
already having an argument with someone.

14:03.562 --> 14:05.730
Maybe you should've brought the friend who
hums the songs and roots for the Nazis.

14:05.731 --> 14:08.299
The woman moved for me, that's all I know.

14:08.300 --> 14:09.801
That's because her legs are like a stuck
pickle jar. I loosened them for you.

14:09.802 --> 14:12.370
- Oh God.
- Give me that!

14:12.371 --> 14:14.838
- Hey!
- It's matinee crowds, you know?

14:14.839 --> 14:17.574
- What about matinee crowds?
- They're different than night crowds.

14:17.575 --> 14:19.009
- They're older. Crankier.
- Just calm down and read your program.

14:21.813 --> 14:25.616
Oh, I know one of the
assistant costumers here.

14:25.617 --> 14:27.885
She helped me with "Nutcracker" last year.

14:27.886 --> 14:30.553
Good for her, getting this gig.

14:30.554 --> 14:33.890
So you've taught your first ballet
class since getting back, right?

14:33.891 --> 14:35.991
- How'd it go?
- Fine. They're all a little rusty.

14:35.992 --> 14:38.192
- And how was Sasha?
- Sunshine sweet.

14:38.193 --> 14:40.896
She's definitely going through a phase.

14:40.897 --> 14:43.965
- That's going into its third year.
- So what's the strategy?

14:43.966 --> 14:46.467
I've already cut her from a dance
she's doing. That delivered a message.

14:46.468 --> 14:48.469
Sasha's never been cut from a dance.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.805
- You cut her from "Nutcracker"?
- No!

14:50.806 --> 14:52.740
I need her for "Nutcracker."
This was something else.

14:52.741 --> 14:55.976
But she got the message. Trust me.

14:55.977 --> 14:57.144
Oh, here we go.

15:01.215 --> 15:02.783
Hmph. Slow reader... figures.

15:17.598 --> 15:20.033
- What's that?
- My own secret recipe.

15:20.034 --> 15:22.368
The brownie's just our regular brownie,

15:22.369 --> 15:24.903
but I made the topping: whipped
cream, crushed cherries,

15:24.904 --> 15:27.539
- cocoa powder...
- And tabasco?

15:27.540 --> 15:30.175
That's the secret.

15:30.176 --> 15:31.509
- It's good.
- It's on the house.

15:31.510 --> 15:33.078
Thanks.

15:35.514 --> 15:38.750
So you're, like, talking to me.

15:38.751 --> 15:41.385
- Of course I am. - You're not
mad about the Ginger Rogers thing?

15:41.386 --> 15:43.754
Nah, I've done Ginger. Done her to death.

15:43.755 --> 15:45.556
- I'm fine with you doing it.
- Really?

15:45.557 --> 15:47.091
That's great.

15:50.161 --> 15:52.396
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

15:52.397 --> 15:56.199
- You never go in the sun.
- Yes, I do.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.434
- You don't. You hate the sun.
- I love the sun.

15:58.435 --> 16:00.837
I've known you since you were four.
We met in line

16:00.838 --> 16:03.473
in kindergarten and your
parasol hit me in the eye.

16:03.474 --> 16:06.209
- Kind of a cute meet.
- Why were you in the sun?

16:06.210 --> 16:08.678
- Because I wanted to be.
- You hate the sun.

16:08.679 --> 16:10.146
- People change, Boo.
- But...

16:10.147 --> 16:11.047
People change!

16:14.918 --> 16:17.385
- I didn't make you mad at me, did I?
- Not yet.

16:17.386 --> 16:19.121
- I've got to get back to work.
- Thanks for the dessert.

16:28.513 --> 16:29.613
Torrid, I'd call it.

16:29.639 --> 16:31.339
I don't know what
you're getting so upset about.

16:31.365 --> 16:33.599
The house! The house!
I'm upset about the house!

16:33.600 --> 16:35.535
Mormons?

16:35.536 --> 16:37.337
Russell.

16:45.145 --> 16:47.313
- Hmmm.
- Huh.

16:47.314 --> 16:50.782
- Hah.
- Huhhh.

16:50.783 --> 16:53.285
- I'm confused.
- Me too. Which one was Mirabelle?

16:53.286 --> 16:55.854
- The redhead, I think.
- I thought that was Catalina.

16:55.855 --> 16:58.723
- Which one was Russell?
- He was the guy at the door.

16:58.724 --> 17:01.226
- Yes, but did we see him earlier?
- Oh God, I don't know.

17:01.227 --> 17:04.095
- There are too many characters.
- And too many plots.

17:04.096 --> 17:06.530
- I wish it was a mormon at the door.
- A singing mormon.

17:06.531 --> 17:07.832
- Are you using the restroom?
- I'm fine. Are you?

17:07.833 --> 17:09.099
Yes.

17:12.170 --> 17:14.271
- Then shouldn't you go?
- No.

17:14.271 --> 17:17.140
For I am going to utilize
the Ortega maneuver.

17:17.141 --> 17:21.044
- The what? - A choreographer I worked
with, Kenny Ortega, taught it to me.

17:21.045 --> 17:24.080
It's surprisingly simple: instead
of rushing to the ladies' room

17:24.082 --> 17:27.251
and getting into that ridiculously
long line, I take my time.

17:27.252 --> 17:30.152
The line works its way down. Then
as soon as they play the sit down bells

17:30.153 --> 17:32.488
people panic, leave...
I dash in at the last second,

17:32.489 --> 17:34.991
do my thing, dash out, bing-bang-boom,

17:34.992 --> 17:38.127
I'm back in my seat, didn't
have to suffer the line.

17:38.128 --> 17:41.563
Sounds very simple. Like, why would
someone even have to think that up?

17:41.564 --> 17:44.032
I'm going to start slowly getting
into position. You'll watch my seat?

17:44.033 --> 17:45.466
- Why, what's it going to do?
- Just watch it.

17:45.467 --> 17:47.468
No one's going to take your seat.

17:47.469 --> 17:49.905
Please just go the other way. I beg you.

17:49.906 --> 17:51.339
No. This is personal.

17:54.510 --> 17:56.211
- Excuse me.
- Oh, I'm getting up too.

17:58.915 --> 18:00.414
Victory!

18:07.722 --> 18:09.456
- So is it cocktail time yet?
- No!

18:09.457 --> 18:11.758
- No no no no no.
- Shh.

18:11.759 --> 18:13.961
- It started?
- Sorry.

18:13.962 --> 18:16.062
This is not my fault.
I utilized the Ortega maneuver

18:16.063 --> 18:18.398
and I had it all timed out,
but you know what?

18:18.399 --> 18:21.234
There are a couple of Sunday matinee
variables I did not foresee.

18:21.235 --> 18:24.170
One, an older matinee crowd is way
less predictable than a normal crowd,

18:24.171 --> 18:26.806
what with the canes and the
walkers and the "pardon me."

18:26.807 --> 18:29.142
- And they can't hear the sit-down bells.
- It is an older crowd.

18:29.143 --> 18:31.577
And two, guess who was hogging the
last stall at the last second?

18:31.578 --> 18:34.046
I mean, long after she had
finished her business.

18:34.047 --> 18:35.981
- I wouldn't know.
- The lady with the big legs.

18:35.982 --> 18:38.183
Oh, you've seen her.
The big East-European leg woman?

18:38.184 --> 18:40.752
- Shh, please.
- I'm never late for a curtain. Never.

18:40.753 --> 18:43.688
You should arrest that lady. Oh,
and of course, she got back to her seat.

18:43.689 --> 18:46.391
Ugh, I hate that big-legged lady so much.

18:46.392 --> 18:48.259
There's a scene change in about
five minutes. I can get you down then.

18:48.260 --> 18:51.062
Why bother?
Crazy big legs probably won't get up,

18:51.063 --> 18:54.231
and I'll be this big jackass blocking
everyone's view as I'm stumbling over her.

18:54.232 --> 18:56.934
- It's no problem. - You know, the only
reason I had to go to the bathroom

18:56.935 --> 18:59.603
was because I drank a ton of
Fanny's wine because I was so mad

18:59.604 --> 19:02.239
at that big-legged East-European lady.
This has so sucked.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.974
Well, you're welcome
to watch from back here.

19:03.975 --> 19:04.607
Thank you.

19:15.786 --> 19:18.688
Oh no, terrific.
Stay there just as long as you like.

19:18.689 --> 19:20.922
Never mind the fact you should have
crossed three fricking beats ago.

19:20.923 --> 19:23.692
What?

19:23.693 --> 19:27.229
Russell, that lawnmower was brand-new.

19:27.230 --> 19:30.532
- Oh God, shoot me now.
- What was wrong with that?

19:30.533 --> 19:33.502
She's carrying the book
in her downstage hand.

19:33.503 --> 19:35.371
- She does that every time. I correct her
every time. - It looks okay to me.

19:35.372 --> 19:38.473
It's not, okay? It's not.

19:38.474 --> 19:41.542
- Director, right?
- And imminent suicide victim.

19:41.543 --> 19:44.912
- Conor.
- Michelle. Hi.

19:44.913 --> 19:47.448
- I wish I was.
- Is this going to Broadway?

19:47.449 --> 19:50.318
Not like that.

19:50.319 --> 19:52.619
Must be hard getting through
an out of town tryout.

19:52.620 --> 19:55.755
Slowly saw through each of your fingers

19:55.756 --> 19:58.658
with a razor blade dipped in
vinegar... it's more pleasant.

19:58.659 --> 20:01.561
- What brings you to the old lady matinee?
- An old lady.

20:01.562 --> 20:03.630
Well, she's not that old, not
compared to a lot of people here.

20:03.631 --> 20:06.866
I count eight asleep

20:06.867 --> 20:09.402
- and three dead.
- Hey, can I ask you a question?

20:09.403 --> 20:10.769
- Sure.
- What is this about?

20:10.770 --> 20:11.870
- I have no idea.
- No, really.

20:11.871 --> 20:14.640
No, really. I have no idea.

20:14.641 --> 20:18.010
The playwright thinks he's Eugene O'Neill.
This is Ed O'Neill.

20:18.011 --> 20:20.979
- It's got its moments. - They're accidental
and it's definitely a bad audience.

20:20.980 --> 20:23.315
The ladies with the brawny East-European
legs come to these shows.

20:23.316 --> 20:24.682
Wow, you heard that,
with everything going on?

20:24.683 --> 20:26.851
I need something to entertain me.

20:26.852 --> 20:28.420
...Violinist who never heard
of an arpeggio?

20:28.421 --> 20:30.055
She thought it was a type of pasta sauce.

20:33.426 --> 20:35.593
- Why didn't you laugh at that?
- I didn't think it was funny.

20:35.594 --> 20:36.694
- I added that line.
- Then I loved it.

20:36.695 --> 20:38.996
Oh, don't do that.

20:38.997 --> 20:39.997
Go ahead. Scribble some more.

20:48.173 --> 20:51.775
- So big legs skedaddled?
- Michelle, where have you been?

20:51.776 --> 20:53.710
- I was stuck in the back of the house.
- I was worried.

20:53.711 --> 20:55.712
Really? That's nice of you to worry.

20:55.713 --> 20:57.947
I was worried that you'd left without me.

20:57.948 --> 21:00.616
Oh. Nope, I was in the
back with the director.

21:00.617 --> 21:03.919
- Oh?
- Long story.

21:03.920 --> 21:06.354
Nice guy. Going through hell, poor thing.

21:06.355 --> 21:08.723
- I can drive myself back, you know.
- Why?

21:08.724 --> 21:11.726
- If you want to sleep with him.
- I'm not sleeping with him.

21:11.727 --> 21:14.496
Why? There are ways for you to get home.

21:14.497 --> 21:17.732
- There are busses. - I'm not going
to take a midnight Greyhound bus home

21:17.733 --> 21:20.434
after having quick sex with a guy I just
met in the back of a theater, thank you.

21:20.435 --> 21:22.470
- It doesn't have to be quick.
- That wasn't my point.

21:22.471 --> 21:25.539
You may want to reconsider.
He's a director.

21:25.540 --> 21:28.542
- He could get you a role.
- I'm not looking for a role.

21:28.543 --> 21:31.345
There are taxis too,
if you don't want a bus.

21:31.346 --> 21:33.780
Although that'll cost a fortune.
Could he drive you home?

21:33.781 --> 21:35.882
I don't know if he has a car.

21:35.883 --> 21:38.384
- And I'm not sleeping with him!
- Okay.

21:38.385 --> 21:41.053
I just don't want you to miss
a quick boff on my account.

21:41.054 --> 21:43.923
You know, hearing that, I do feel
comfortable having a quick boff with him.

21:43.924 --> 21:45.958
Perhaps in the alley.
And if it's that quick,

21:45.959 --> 21:48.328
you and I could still go home together.

21:48.329 --> 21:52.430
Fine. Anything less than 20
minutes and I'm willing to wait.

21:58.794 --> 22:02.229
- Piano's out of tune.
- I just had it tuned.

22:02.230 --> 22:04.698
- Well, the deaf guy missed something.
- He wasn't deaf.

22:04.699 --> 22:06.566
You hear that?

22:06.567 --> 22:08.335
That is not one note. That's three.

22:08.336 --> 22:10.303
So it's a chord. Music has chords.

22:10.304 --> 22:12.640
I've got my tuning lever,
I'll fix it myself.

22:12.641 --> 22:14.608
You hurt your hand the last
time you fixed it yourself.

22:14.609 --> 22:17.243
- Do not touch my piano.
- Okay.

22:17.244 --> 22:20.913
So what madness do you have
going on here today?

22:20.914 --> 22:24.250
That's my Firebird,
a staple of all my mall shows.

22:24.251 --> 22:26.786
That's my "on the town"
group... a big crowd pleaser.

22:26.787 --> 22:29.188
And that's my Ginger.

22:29.189 --> 22:32.590
I'll be right back. Boo!

22:32.591 --> 22:36.662
- Yes, madame Fanny? - I want you
to begin practicing with your Fred.

22:36.663 --> 22:39.330
- Great. Jordan's here?
- It's not going to be Jordan.

22:39.331 --> 22:41.900
Oh. What happened?

22:41.901 --> 22:45.503
He, um, had to drop out. Family matter.

22:45.504 --> 22:47.072
That's your partner. Carl!

22:47.073 --> 22:49.506
Carl?

22:49.507 --> 22:52.176
Hi, madame Fanny. Hi, Boo.

22:52.177 --> 22:56.380
- Hello, Carl.
- So you're going to be my Fred Astaire.

22:56.381 --> 22:59.116
- You up for it?
- Am I up for it? Hello.

22:59.117 --> 23:01.518
I will channel the man.
I'm there. I'm already there.

23:01.519 --> 23:03.787
I'm not even here anymore.
That's how there I am.

23:03.788 --> 23:06.189
- I don't know how I could possibly...
- Dyap-dyap-dyap-dyap.

23:06.190 --> 23:08.524
Now I'm going to start
with my "On the town."

23:08.525 --> 23:11.161
Why don't you two watch
the tapes of Sasha and Jordan,

23:11.162 --> 23:12.662
do what you can and I'll
fill in the rest later?

23:12.663 --> 23:14.864
You got it.

23:14.865 --> 23:18.634
I'm plotzing.

23:18.635 --> 23:20.368
Well, get some water. I'll be right back.

23:25.575 --> 23:27.475
- Madame Fanny?
- Yes?

23:27.476 --> 23:31.279
I was just wondering...

23:31.280 --> 23:34.516
Do you think Carl's right for this?

23:34.517 --> 23:37.752
Of course he is.
It's my job to know these things.

23:37.753 --> 23:40.554
I'm not questioning your
knowledge or anything,

23:40.555 --> 23:43.758
but I was just thinking, don't you
think there's a certain something...

23:43.759 --> 23:46.360
- Lacking?
- Well, he lacks Jordan's skills.

23:46.361 --> 23:48.763
- And?
- And what?

23:48.764 --> 23:52.398
- Height.
- So crouch a little.

23:52.399 --> 23:54.968
- While dancing backwards in heels?
- I'll have him jump a lot.

23:54.969 --> 23:57.469
That'll even it out.
Now go on, make the best of it.

23:58.505 --> 24:01.541
Madame Fanny, would you
mind if I called him?

24:01.542 --> 24:04.177
- Who?
- Jordan, and asked about his family matter?

24:04.178 --> 24:06.079
- Boo... - It better be a death,
that's all I'm saying.

24:06.080 --> 24:09.982
Boo, listen to me, Jordan is special.

24:09.983 --> 24:12.818
Every dance company in the Western
hemisphere is clamoring for him.

24:12.819 --> 24:17.022
He's very talented and...
oh, let's face it,

24:17.023 --> 24:19.658
a giant egomaniac, as most
talented male dancers are.

24:19.659 --> 24:21.426
I wouldn't take it too seriously.

24:21.427 --> 24:23.795
He didn't even give me a chance.

24:23.796 --> 24:27.031
Look, Boo, I'll admit Carl

24:27.032 --> 24:29.934
is rough around the edges
and not your height.

24:29.935 --> 24:34.405
But what he lacks in everything,
he makes up for in enthusiasm.

24:34.406 --> 24:38.709
He wants this so badly.
He loves it more than anyone in this room.

24:38.710 --> 24:41.912
And sometimes enthusiasm
is enough to create magic.

24:41.913 --> 24:44.714
Or a train wreck.

24:44.715 --> 24:47.384
It's nice to give
the unexpected person a shot

24:47.385 --> 24:49.552
once in a while, don't you think?

24:49.553 --> 24:52.555
- I guess.
- Try.

24:52.556 --> 24:54.825
- For me?
- Yes, ma'am.

25:04.334 --> 25:06.969
Why does everything
always happen to me?

25:06.970 --> 25:10.572
- Tough break.
- Expecting Jordan and getting Carl.

25:10.573 --> 25:13.474
- Little Carl. - You went
from Rogers-Astaire to Rogers-Dinklage.

25:13.475 --> 25:15.576
Don't you think I should have been
consulted? I mean, really.

25:15.577 --> 25:18.780
- I'm Ginger Rogers.
- Madame Fanny does not consult.

25:18.781 --> 25:21.049
- Maybe from a distance it won't look
so weird. - It's gonna look weird.

25:21.050 --> 25:23.651
You won't really be
dancing cheek to cheek.

25:23.652 --> 25:25.787
- More like cheek to yawning-gap-
over-his-head. - Don't make this worse.

25:25.788 --> 25:27.588
It'll be like that Stonehenge
bit from "Spinal Tap."

25:27.589 --> 25:30.157
You might accidentally trod on him.

25:30.158 --> 25:32.392
- It's all about the pituitary gland,
you know. - What is?

25:32.393 --> 25:34.195
- Dwarfism. I did a paper on it.
- He's not a dwarf.

25:34.196 --> 25:36.697
- He's close.
- Think he'll grow beyond this?

25:36.698 --> 25:38.899
- Probably not. - He definitely
should not take up cigar smoking.

25:38.900 --> 25:40.835
A cigar's never going
to look right in his hand.

25:40.836 --> 25:42.870
He's already texted me
four times about rehearsal

25:42.871 --> 25:45.238
and he's still downstairs
in the dressing room.

25:45.239 --> 25:47.640
- He's got a lot of energy.
- He kind of reminds me of our dog.

25:47.641 --> 25:50.476
- We have a really small dog.
- I just think I should have been consulted.

25:50.477 --> 25:52.212
- I'm Ginger Rogers.
- That's showbiz, Ginger.

25:59.886 --> 26:02.855
- I told you it was gonna be close.
- You did, you did.

26:02.856 --> 26:05.190
- That calls for some wine.
- Oh, come on!

26:05.191 --> 26:08.227
- Is the man blind?
- That was a swing.

26:08.228 --> 26:11.029
- I'll lose a game, but not to the ump.
- Hi, guys.

26:11.030 --> 26:14.566
- Hey, Michelle. Are you a White Sox fan?
- Nope.

26:14.567 --> 26:18.135
- Ah, Cubs fan. My condolences.
- Not a Cubs fan.

26:18.136 --> 26:20.537
If you're an Indians fan, I'm
gonna have to ask you to leave.

26:20.538 --> 26:23.507
- She doesn't follow baseball.
- I'm sorry,

26:23.508 --> 26:25.276
- then what's the point of living?
- She doesn't follow any sport.

26:25.277 --> 26:27.644
I follow the Kardashians. That's a sport.

26:27.645 --> 26:30.181
Never knew you were a baseball fan.

26:30.182 --> 26:32.749
Are you kidding? She can rattle
off stats with the best of them.

26:32.750 --> 26:35.952
- Guess I've just never heard
her stats-rattle. - Hey!

26:35.953 --> 26:38.388
- Picked him off! - He wasn't supposed
to be on base in the first place.

26:38.389 --> 26:39.189
Definitely. Definitely.

26:43.227 --> 26:46.462
I will leave you to your game. Enjoy.

26:46.463 --> 26:48.830
I'm going shopping tomorrow.
Want to come with?

26:48.831 --> 26:51.700
- Yeah, I'll tag along.
- I'll get you some socks.

26:51.701 --> 26:54.403
- I don't want any socks.
- You need socks.

26:54.404 --> 26:56.904
- Fanny, I don't want any socks.
- Trust me, you need socks.

26:59.142 --> 27:00.642
Bettina.

27:02.712 --> 27:04.612
Bettina!

27:06.315 --> 27:07.581
I have to work.

27:14.456 --> 27:17.458
- Hi! - Oh jeez, Carl!
You scared me half to death.

27:17.459 --> 27:20.460
- Sorry.
- Don't call me Bettina, okay?

27:20.461 --> 27:23.363
- But that's your name.
- Call me Boo. Everyone calls me Boo.

27:23.364 --> 27:26.766
Fine. I like Bettina, but Boo it is.

27:26.767 --> 27:29.669
Those are the parents. It's been a
little tense in the Cramer household.

27:29.670 --> 27:31.671
Not hearing much lovemaking these days.

27:31.672 --> 27:34.774
- Ew.
- I'm just sayin'.

27:34.775 --> 27:38.544
- So you wanna hear my Stewie Griffin?
- I really am busy, Carl.

27:38.545 --> 27:41.680
Okay, just give me your email.

27:41.681 --> 27:44.783
I want to send you links to Astaire-Rogers
dances. There's a bunch on YouTube.

27:44.784 --> 27:46.852
You don't need to do that.
Fanny's choreographing the dance

27:46.853 --> 27:48.787
and we have the Sasha-Jordan tapes.

27:48.788 --> 27:51.457
She told us to bring
some ideas to the table.

27:51.458 --> 27:54.259
They do this one dance where
Astaire is hypnotizing Ginger,

27:54.260 --> 27:56.695
so I've been working on my hypno-stare.

27:58.731 --> 28:01.732
Don't do that.

28:01.733 --> 28:04.234
I think if we keep it simple,
we're gonna wow 'em.

28:04.235 --> 28:08.305
Sure, we'll keep it simple.
You don't have to do that.

28:08.306 --> 28:10.808
I don't mind. You're actually going to
be a better Ginger Rogers than Sasha.

28:10.809 --> 28:13.344
Oh, no way. Sasha's great.

28:13.345 --> 28:16.412
She's got ballet brain.
She can't adapt. You can.

28:16.413 --> 28:17.547
- More water here!
- Got it.

28:20.284 --> 28:22.486
A "please" would've been nice to hear.

28:22.487 --> 28:25.889
You're crazy.

28:25.890 --> 28:27.824
I should get back to the Bickersons.
You good here?

28:27.825 --> 28:31.361
Yeah. Thanks, Carl.

28:31.362 --> 28:33.028
You're gonna want to hear
my Stewie Griffin. Mark my words.

28:44.715 --> 28:47.149
- Hello, you two.
- Good morning.

28:47.150 --> 28:49.985
Hey, Michelle. What are you up to?

28:49.986 --> 28:52.554
I was just going to grab an
orange or some stale melba toast

28:52.555 --> 28:55.224
or a flavored toothpick.
Something to keep body and soul together.

28:55.225 --> 28:57.959
- Forget that. Come join us.
- Oh, I wouldn't want to impose.

28:57.960 --> 29:00.895
Who are you to say no
to a kinky breakfast?

29:00.896 --> 29:03.398
Yeah, you know, Michael, I kinda
misspoke when I said that.

29:03.399 --> 29:05.834
Come on, get in here.
Sit in my chair, mooch.

29:05.835 --> 29:08.469
Oh well, when you sweet talk a girl.

29:08.470 --> 29:10.738
I was just going to get some more coffee.
Be right back.

29:10.739 --> 29:12.873
Don't do anything kinky while I'm gone.

29:12.874 --> 29:14.842
Really, Michael, it was
a dumb thing to say.

29:14.843 --> 29:16.544
I don't even want to know
what you're talking about.

29:16.545 --> 29:19.880
- I like him.
- Me too.

29:19.881 --> 29:22.716
- Where'd you meet?
- In a dirty jazz club in Monterey.

29:22.717 --> 29:25.619
I sat in the back... at first.

29:25.620 --> 29:29.956
Then I saw him and I worked my way
down front right in his eyeline.

29:29.957 --> 29:32.225
- He lost his place a couple of times.
- You show-wrecker.

29:32.226 --> 29:34.827
- That's me.
- Was he married?

29:34.828 --> 29:36.630
- He happened not to be.
- Well, let me ask you this...

29:36.631 --> 29:40.232
you guys are so in sync.

29:40.233 --> 29:42.601
You're watching baseball,
you're eating on TV trays,

29:42.602 --> 29:44.836
and I've never seen you smile so much.

29:44.837 --> 29:46.838
Why haven't you made it more permanent?

29:46.839 --> 29:49.174
It is permanent.
We've known each other forever.

29:49.175 --> 29:52.144
But it's permanently not permanent.
Why is that?

29:52.145 --> 29:54.912
When Michael and I met, Hubbell's
father had just left us,

29:54.913 --> 29:57.382
I was not looking to rush
into a long-term relationship.

29:57.383 --> 29:59.216
- Neither was Michael.
- But in all the years since?

29:59.217 --> 30:02.253
We did talk about marriage once.

30:02.254 --> 30:05.556
When Hubbell was about 10 or so.

30:05.557 --> 30:08.693
But Hubbell had a fit, broke the model
airplane he had been working on.

30:08.694 --> 30:11.528
It was a very big deal, so we dropped it.

30:11.529 --> 30:14.097
He was very young, it was understandable.

30:14.098 --> 30:16.633
- And you never revisited?
- No.

30:16.634 --> 30:20.069
We never revisited.

30:20.070 --> 30:23.307
He's a troubadour, you know.

30:23.308 --> 30:24.775
- He doesn't even own a house.
- You're kind of his house.

30:27.344 --> 30:29.278
Some more kinky coffee, ladies.

30:29.279 --> 30:30.780
I'm never gonna hear
the end of this, am I?

30:30.781 --> 30:31.847
- Probably not.
- Pour away.

30:39.122 --> 30:42.124
It's open.

30:42.125 --> 30:44.793
- This door should be locked.
- Why?

30:44.794 --> 30:47.662
You're alone. I want you safe.

30:47.663 --> 30:50.598
- Well, you're late.
- I stopped to get us some Cel-Rey tonic.

30:50.599 --> 30:52.734
I had to go to five
different stores to find it.

30:52.735 --> 30:56.070
- I love Cel-Rey tonic.
- I know.

30:56.071 --> 30:59.139
- How do you know? - I heard you
say it once to someone a couple years ago.

30:59.140 --> 31:01.775
And you remembered? No way.

31:01.776 --> 31:04.712
So did you watch the footage
of Sasha and Jordan?

31:04.713 --> 31:07.748
- It made me feel small.
- Well, we're not them.

31:07.749 --> 31:09.983
But look at it like we're
a different interpretation...

31:09.984 --> 31:12.419
the everyman's version.

31:12.420 --> 31:14.954
We are the street
version of Fred and Ginger.

31:14.955 --> 31:19.392
- Sounds good.
- Now the foundation is just waltz.

31:19.393 --> 31:22.762
We can waltz. But I want to start
with something kind of flashy

31:22.763 --> 31:25.565
before we actually dance
together, is that okay?

31:25.566 --> 31:29.001
- You lead, I'll follow.
- I'm gonna start with my back to you.

31:29.002 --> 31:31.703
And I'm gonna have a flower
and I'm gonna smell it.

31:31.704 --> 31:35.273
Like that.

31:35.274 --> 31:37.843
Then I'll turn and see you and
I'll toss the flower away.

31:37.844 --> 31:39.611
Then I'll step, hop, step, hop hop,

31:39.612 --> 31:42.647
step, turn... whoa.

31:42.648 --> 31:45.650
I should include "get dizzy" at the end
of that 'cause I'm freakin' dizzy.

31:45.651 --> 31:48.085
- You should definitely turn less.
- For sure.

31:48.086 --> 31:50.554
So after the intro

31:50.555 --> 31:52.490
and I've turned less,

31:52.491 --> 31:55.125
we're waltzing,

31:55.126 --> 31:56.960
we're waltzing. And are you ready?

31:56.961 --> 32:00.264
- For what?
- A dip!

32:00.265 --> 32:02.199
We gotta give 'em a dip or two.

32:02.200 --> 32:05.301
- We can do dips, right?
- Definitely.

32:05.302 --> 32:08.137
So when did I say I liked Cel-Rey tonic?
Was it really two years ago?

32:08.138 --> 32:10.640
You were talking to Ginny.
School just got out,

32:10.641 --> 32:13.142
so it must have been June.
You were wearing pink shoes.

32:13.143 --> 32:15.011
I still have those shoes.

32:18.715 --> 32:20.716
- Shall we continue?
- As long as you want.

32:38.934 --> 32:41.502
- Hello?
- I cut the joke.

32:41.503 --> 32:43.905
- Conor?
- Yeah. I cut the joke you didn't laugh at.

32:43.906 --> 32:46.140
It was a miracle cut.

32:46.141 --> 32:48.676
- Oh stop.
- No, I'm not kidding.

32:48.677 --> 32:51.210
It was one of those magical little
changes that opened the whole scene up.

32:51.211 --> 32:53.480
Now the Catalina character
seems less like a dolt,

32:53.481 --> 32:55.515
I have Russell exiting sooner.
The scene just flies now.

32:55.516 --> 32:57.651
Wow. Maybe I missed my calling.

32:57.652 --> 32:59.986
- You want to come down and see it?
- See what?

32:59.987 --> 33:02.622
Knott's berry farm.
The play, what do you think?

33:02.623 --> 33:04.858
- Tonight?
- Tonight. We'll watch, we'll marvel,

33:04.859 --> 33:07.125
- we'll grab a bite after.
- Sure.

33:07.126 --> 33:09.227
- I'll be there.
- Great.

33:09.228 --> 33:11.196
You know how I know when
I'd been in L.A. too long?

33:11.197 --> 33:13.999
- How?
- I'm starting to like it.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.901
There might be other reasons.

33:15.902 --> 33:17.035
- See you tonight.
- See you tonight.

33:26.116 --> 33:28.217
Russell, what
should I tell the police

33:28.218 --> 33:30.019
if they come sniffing around?

33:30.020 --> 33:32.487
And then what shall I tell y'all?

33:32.488 --> 33:34.590
- Did you just say "y'all"?
- Damn straight.

33:34.591 --> 33:36.925
Catalina, is it worth...

33:36.926 --> 33:38.960
- Beat me with a crowbar.
- Why is he stepping on every line?

33:38.961 --> 33:41.629
I told him to jump on
his cues, not mug them.

33:41.630 --> 33:43.765
- You gotta put that joke back.
- They would kill me if I put that joke back.

33:43.766 --> 33:46.201
- You need some funny in here.
- I swear it worked last night.

33:46.202 --> 33:48.036
- And this audience... dead, right?
- Comatose.

33:48.037 --> 33:50.038
Ohhh!

33:50.039 --> 33:52.840
- He can't open a door.
- It's sticking on him.

33:52.841 --> 33:54.374
- That's sets, right? We've gotta
get sets on it. - I got it.

33:54.375 --> 33:55.675
- I got it.
- I got it.

34:03.251 --> 34:05.452
- So you were an actor.
- I was.

34:05.453 --> 34:07.687
- I bet you were good.
- I was.

34:07.688 --> 34:09.889
- That sounded arrogant.
- Theater?

34:09.889 --> 34:12.958
A lot of theater. Too much theater.

34:12.960 --> 34:15.862
- My feet hurt just thinking about it.
- Just theater? No TV?

34:15.862 --> 34:18.697
No, I did some TV.
But you know what I never got?

34:18.697 --> 34:21.600
- "Law & Order." - I thought every
New York actor's been on "Law & Order."

34:21.601 --> 34:24.003
Not me. And I went up for all of them:

34:24.004 --> 34:26.536
The mothership, "S.V.U.,"
"Criminal Intent," parental neglect,

34:26.538 --> 34:28.940
special weird guy unit... nothing.

34:28.940 --> 34:31.609
- Unbelievable.
- I know.

34:31.610 --> 34:33.578
In this world you either
look like a rapist

34:33.579 --> 34:35.480
or someone trying to catch a rapist.

34:35.481 --> 34:38.116
How did I fall between
those two categories?

34:38.117 --> 34:40.284
I say wear it as a badge of honor. You're
the guy who never got on "Law & Order"

34:40.286 --> 34:42.286
- despite countless attempts.
- What about you?

34:42.286 --> 34:44.621
- Did you ever act?
- A little.

34:44.621 --> 34:47.357
I was in a feminine product commercial.

34:47.358 --> 34:49.760
- Oh, this I want to hear about.
- "It's got wings!"

34:52.330 --> 34:54.130
- What the hell was that?
- My line.

34:54.132 --> 34:56.966
That's glorious!

34:56.967 --> 35:00.069
- And it was after I did a somersault.
- Why were you somersaulting?

35:00.070 --> 35:02.338
There were a bunch of us
in a grassy field.

35:02.339 --> 35:04.473
We were all supposed to be blooming

35:04.474 --> 35:06.742
or photosynthesizing or something.

35:06.743 --> 35:08.577
Please tell me there's a copy of this.

35:08.578 --> 35:11.247
There may be a screening in the future

35:11.248 --> 35:12.515
if you play your cards right.

35:15.751 --> 35:19.587
You know I was nervous when I called you.

35:19.588 --> 35:22.791
- You didn't sound nervous.
- I utilized my acting skills.

35:22.792 --> 35:25.460
Very impressive.

35:25.461 --> 35:28.063
- I'm glad you called.
- Yeah, me too.

35:28.064 --> 35:30.932
It's been awhile for me... doing this.

35:30.933 --> 35:32.800
- Sleeping with a director?
- With anybody.

35:32.801 --> 35:35.736
- Same here.
- Quite awhile.

35:38.273 --> 35:42.243
- Are we talking years?
- No, but awhile.

35:42.244 --> 35:44.478
Months, not since...

35:46.280 --> 35:48.681
- Not since?
- Since...

35:48.682 --> 35:51.885
Oooh, oh my God.

35:51.886 --> 35:53.453
- Oh...
- Whoa whoa whoa, are you crying?

35:53.454 --> 35:55.989
- What is this?
- I don't know.

35:55.990 --> 35:57.958
- What is happening? - I don't know.
What did I do? What did I say?

35:57.959 --> 35:59.159
- How can I unsay it?
- I was not anticipating this.

35:59.160 --> 36:01.560
Me neither.

36:01.561 --> 36:04.129
- This was going so well.
- It was.

36:04.130 --> 36:08.200
How can I reverse it? I mean,
what can I do? Make you laugh, what?

36:08.201 --> 36:11.170
- Sure. - Okay look, there's not
enough room for the somersaulting,

36:11.171 --> 36:14.773
but... "it's got wings!"

36:14.774 --> 36:16.742
- Oh, that did not go well at all.
- Where is this coming from?

36:16.743 --> 36:18.576
I don't know. You were just saying
you hadn't been with anyone since...

36:18.577 --> 36:22.546
- Hubbell.
- Hubbell, okay.

36:22.547 --> 36:25.649
That's your rosebud
or your very large telescope.

36:25.650 --> 36:27.485
- Hubbell. Poor Hubbell, he's gone.
- Where did he go?

36:29.355 --> 36:32.156
Oh, he is not with us any longer.

36:32.157 --> 36:34.524
- He's not. He's gone.
- I'm sorry.

36:34.525 --> 36:37.827
No, it's... it's doing this,

36:37.828 --> 36:41.231
the last time was with him and then
he died and now it's all welling up.

36:41.232 --> 36:43.367
- Boyfriend?
- Husband.

36:43.368 --> 36:47.237
- Wow.
- I was in shock.

36:47.238 --> 36:50.907
I'd never been in shock.
I didn't even know I was in shock.

36:50.908 --> 36:53.709
And then I was dealing with his
mother and she was in shock

36:53.710 --> 36:56.212
then I inherited all his stuff
and I had all this paperwork

36:56.213 --> 36:59.348
and I guess it all must have
gotten buried and now here it is.

36:59.349 --> 37:01.183
- I'll say it's here.
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

37:01.184 --> 37:04.186
No no no, it's... this is good.

37:04.187 --> 37:07.155
This is what we try to write
and what we try to convey

37:07.156 --> 37:11.426
and, wow, are you conveying it right here,

37:11.427 --> 37:15.297
- right now.
- It's not nice to the guy to cry after sex.

37:15.298 --> 37:18.433
- Well, it's different, I'll give you that.
- Poor Hubbell.

37:18.434 --> 37:20.235
I'm beginning to feel bad for the guy.

37:20.236 --> 37:22.803
He was a good guy, a good man. I should go.

37:22.804 --> 37:25.306
No no no no... stay here
as long as you want.

37:25.307 --> 37:27.641
Thank you. I'm so sorry, I am so sorry.

37:27.642 --> 37:29.676
No, it's okay.

37:29.677 --> 37:32.212
- Oh!
- What?

37:32.213 --> 37:34.514
Think about having the Tony character

37:34.515 --> 37:36.883
spill something at dinner at act two

37:36.884 --> 37:39.118
so his clumsiness doesn't come
out of the blue at the end.

37:39.119 --> 37:40.886
Oh, that's good.

37:40.887 --> 37:41.554
No, that's really good.

37:51.798 --> 37:55.400
- Michael, stop.
- Stop what?

37:55.401 --> 37:59.338
You do all the cooking, let me clean up.
That was the deal.

37:59.339 --> 38:01.873
- I'm just trying to expedite things here.
- Give me that.

38:01.874 --> 38:05.010
Okay, I'm just warning you,

38:05.011 --> 38:08.280
if I sit on that couch out there,

38:08.281 --> 38:11.148
- I'm gonna fall asleep.
- Then stay in here with me.

38:11.149 --> 38:13.084
- You'll let me do that.
- I will let you do that.

38:13.085 --> 38:14.251
Then I'll help you dry.

38:17.122 --> 38:19.656
So...

38:19.657 --> 38:21.658
how long were you planning on staying?

38:21.659 --> 38:24.161
I don't know. Maybe a week?

38:24.162 --> 38:27.097
I should check with my manager.
See if I got bookings.

38:27.098 --> 38:30.000
I hate talking to my manager.

38:30.001 --> 38:33.636
I know.

38:33.637 --> 38:36.672
- So why were you asking?
- I was thinking,

38:36.673 --> 38:39.142
maybe this time...

38:39.143 --> 38:42.144
don't rush off.

38:42.145 --> 38:44.946
I wasn't gonna rush off.

38:44.947 --> 38:47.516
Good.

38:47.517 --> 38:50.219
Stay... as long as you want.

38:50.220 --> 38:53.222
As long as you can.

38:53.223 --> 38:55.924
- You're not gonna get sick of me?
-  No.

38:59.828 --> 39:01.762
I miss you.

39:01.763 --> 39:04.165
Then I'll stay as long as I can.

39:05.834 --> 39:07.635
- Good.
- Good.

39:24.485 --> 39:27.087
- Wow, glamorous.
- It feels a little tight.

39:27.088 --> 39:29.155
Well, if it rips, pretend
it's a part of the act.

39:29.156 --> 39:32.425
- Where's your partner?
- Over there.

39:32.426 --> 39:34.726
- He looks ridiculous.
- Like an organ grinder's monkey.

39:34.727 --> 39:36.728
- He doesn't look that bad.
- He's no Jordan.

39:36.729 --> 39:38.397
Tell me he's not going to wear a top hat.

39:38.398 --> 39:39.765
It kept falling off in rehearsal.

39:51.876 --> 39:54.478
- Mind if I sit in?
- No, please.

39:54.479 --> 39:55.912
- Michael's sitting in too.
- Great.

39:55.913 --> 39:58.648
So...

39:58.649 --> 40:00.184
What is it? I'm already behind.

40:00.185 --> 40:02.819
Nothing, I just...

40:02.820 --> 40:06.423
I just was thinking
about Hubbell last night.

40:06.424 --> 40:09.192
- Hubbell?
- Yeah.

40:09.193 --> 40:12.795
And I just thought that I'd tell you.

40:12.796 --> 40:15.264
Thank you.

40:15.265 --> 40:16.799
So I'll see you after.

40:21.671 --> 40:23.705
- Hey, Michael.
- Hey, Michelle.

40:23.706 --> 40:26.874
- Missed you at kinky breakfast.
- Will you stop?

40:26.875 --> 40:29.344
Kinky breakfast is just not
kinky breakfast without you.

40:29.345 --> 40:31.813
- I said it once.
- And it will live forever.

40:38.521 --> 40:40.954
This tie is driving me crazy.

40:40.955 --> 40:44.057
- You look very dashing though.
- Thank you.

40:44.058 --> 40:47.761
You know tonight, you should come over and
watch "That's entertainment" with me.

40:47.762 --> 40:50.964
I'd loan it to you, but it's my
mom's and she's not into loaning.

40:50.965 --> 40:53.634
- I'll whip us up a lasagna for dinner.
- You can whip up lasagna?

40:53.635 --> 40:56.669
From scratch. My grandmother taught me.

40:56.670 --> 40:59.172
How a life-long Jew learned how to
make a killer lasagna, I don't know,

40:59.173 --> 41:01.574
but she taught me and it is the best.

41:01.575 --> 41:04.144
So what do you say? Tonight, 6:30?

41:04.145 --> 41:06.812
Quick answer for you, Carl... no.

41:06.813 --> 41:09.449
- Yeah, come on, dude, get a clue.
- What are you talking about?

41:09.450 --> 41:12.050
She's not your frickin' girlfriend.
She's your dance partner,

41:12.051 --> 41:14.653
which means she's not going to come over
to your house for your sad lasagna.

41:14.654 --> 41:15.887
Boo, step in here.
You don't even like lasagna.

41:18.291 --> 41:20.225
The cheese does something
bad to my stomach.

41:20.226 --> 41:21.059
See? No loser lasagna tonight.

41:22.529 --> 41:24.396
Yeah sure.

41:24.397 --> 41:25.664
Sorry, Boo.

41:29.134 --> 41:31.134
- Idiot.
- They just get dumber every year.

41:31.537 --> 41:34.138
Break a leg.

41:34.139 --> 41:36.840
Okay, everybody.
This is a loose dress rehearsal.

41:36.841 --> 41:39.310
Don't be afraid to make mistakes.

41:39.311 --> 41:42.146
We'll start with Fred and
Ginger, then it's "On the town"

41:42.147 --> 41:44.548
and "Firebird." So anyone who's
not playing Fred and Ginger

41:44.549 --> 41:46.115
should be off the floor.

41:49.520 --> 41:52.755
Sasha!

41:52.756 --> 41:54.824
Come over here right now.

41:54.825 --> 41:57.627
- I'm fine where I am.
- Sasha!

41:57.628 --> 41:59.928
Whoa whoa, honey, this is Fanny's world.

41:59.929 --> 42:02.565
What makes you think you can
sashay in here like this,

42:02.566 --> 42:05.100
- your hair ruined...
- It's not all about you, Fanny.

42:05.101 --> 42:07.570
In here it is all about me.

42:07.571 --> 42:10.072
It's my hair.
I'll do whatever I want with it.

42:10.073 --> 42:11.807
- No.
- Yes!

42:11.808 --> 42:14.743
No! You already got one warning...

42:14.744 --> 42:17.445
You can't tell us how to live
every stupid moment of our lives.

42:17.446 --> 42:19.380
- No! I'm talking.
- It's not fair!

42:19.381 --> 42:21.549
- I'm talking!
- I get to talk too!

42:21.550 --> 42:24.452
You already got one warning, and
to come in here like this...

42:24.453 --> 42:26.954
I'm not the only one sick of all
your stupid rules! We all are!

42:26.955 --> 42:29.455
- We can't even go swimming?
- Stop right now, stop!

42:30.392 --> 42:34.060
- I don't need this!
- Oh really?

42:34.061 --> 42:36.196
No! I'm going out for
cheerleading and I can't do both.

42:38.366 --> 42:40.400
You're right.

42:40.401 --> 42:43.203
You're absolutely right.

42:43.204 --> 42:45.205
You can't do both.

42:45.206 --> 42:47.173
Cheerleading and ballet.

42:48.975 --> 42:49.775
Get out.

43:00.186 --> 43:01.454
- What about show season?
- Shh!

43:03.422 --> 43:05.590
Boo, Carl, dance!
