WEBVTT

00:05.255 --> 00:08.258
Whoo! Let's go, Lemmings!

00:08.342 --> 00:09.676
You gotta believe!

00:11.678 --> 00:12.888
- I got it!
- I got it!

00:12.971 --> 00:14.056
- I got...
Oof.

00:16.266 --> 00:18.352
And be aware of your surroundings.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.812
You gotta believe
and be aware of your surroundings!

00:20.896 --> 00:23.440
"...and I terrified one William Palmer."

00:23.524 --> 00:26.318
Scare Report done and off
to the Ghost Council it goes!

00:29.154 --> 00:31.073
- Now what's going on here?

00:31.281 --> 00:33.867
Nineteen to nothing? Ugh.

00:33.951 --> 00:36.245
Is there like,
any other team we can root for?

00:36.328 --> 00:37.412
No, Scratch.

00:37.496 --> 00:41.208
Look, all Libby and the Lemmings need
to succeed is a little encouragement!

00:41.291 --> 00:43.377
And nobody encourages harder than me.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.963
- Well, that is true.
- And once the Lemmings start winning,

00:46.046 --> 00:48.215
that'll enhappify
our little town of Brighton!

00:48.590 --> 00:50.342
-"Enhappify"?
- It's a word.

00:51.343 --> 00:52.803
That ball's going right to Libby!

00:52.886 --> 00:53.929
You got it, girl!

00:54.596 --> 00:56.306
- Aw.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.350
Nope, I can't put a positive spin on it.

00:58.433 --> 00:59.309
They're terrible.

01:00.602 --> 01:03.230
- I don't want to play anymore.
- Why do I even try?

01:03.897 --> 01:06.858
That was some really great standing
in the field, Libby.

01:06.942 --> 01:10.279
It was outstanding, um, standing.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.781
It's okay, Molly. We know we're awful.

01:12.864 --> 01:15.659
Thanks for coming though.
It was nice to hear your cheers.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.452
Over all the weeping.

01:17.536 --> 01:19.371
Welp, time to call it a day, huh?

01:19.454 --> 01:21.707
We should really get going.
I got a nap with my name on it.

01:21.790 --> 01:24.167
The Lemmings don't believe
in themselves, Scratch.

01:24.251 --> 01:25.752
They don't believe they can be winners.

01:25.836 --> 01:28.672
Well, they believe correctly, Moll,
because, follow me on this...

01:28.755 --> 01:29.840
they're losers.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.634
Hey, everybody deserves a chance
to succeed.

01:32.718 --> 01:35.554
So, what if I joined the Lemmings

01:35.637 --> 01:38.599
and taught them
the power of positive thinking?

01:38.682 --> 01:40.642
A lifetime diet of animated films

01:40.726 --> 01:42.811
has taught me that
as long as I believe in myself,

01:42.894 --> 01:44.771
I can do anything!

01:45.689 --> 01:47.357
Yeah, okay, but, uh...

01:47.441 --> 01:48.859
have you ever even played softball?

01:48.942 --> 01:50.777
Me? Play softball?
Is that what you're asking?

01:50.861 --> 01:52.070
- Have I ever played it?
- Yeah.

01:52.154 --> 01:54.698
No. Have I wanted to play it?

01:54.781 --> 01:55.824
Also no.

01:55.949 --> 01:59.703
- But am I gonna play it? Heck to the yes!

01:59.786 --> 02:02.664
- Oh! Ooh... Sorry!

02:03.749 --> 02:08.211
Okay, Lemmings. To win this game,
all we need to do is believe in ourselves.

02:08.295 --> 02:11.506
-"We're winners" on three. One, two...
- Three?

02:11.590 --> 02:13.216
We're winners?
I'm hungry.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.718
Okay, good enough.

02:14.801 --> 02:17.554
<i>For the Skylarks,
batting first,</i>

02:17.638 --> 02:19.723
<i>Tammy Myers!</i>

02:29.441 --> 02:31.151
Let's see what you've got, kid.

02:32.194 --> 02:34.613
Phew... Just believe.

02:44.456 --> 02:46.249
Is there a circus in town?

02:46.333 --> 02:48.418
'Cause there's a clown on the mound!

02:48.794 --> 02:51.713
How dare you make fun of Molly McGee?

02:52.297 --> 02:53.882
That's my job!

02:59.513 --> 03:00.347
Oof.

03:00.806 --> 03:02.099
Strike one!

03:02.599 --> 03:04.101
- Wha...
- Huh?

03:06.812 --> 03:08.438
- Lucky pitch.
Hah!

03:08.522 --> 03:09.564
Strike two!

03:14.027 --> 03:15.529
Hah!

03:15.612 --> 03:16.988
- Strike three, four, five.

03:17.072 --> 03:20.033
Six, seven, eight, nine.
You're out. Three times.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.706
Ho-ho! Let's hear it

04:02.159 --> 04:04.119
Yeah, I started a little rough,

04:04.202 --> 04:07.622
but, man, I guess positive thinking can
really super charge you,

04:07.706 --> 04:09.082
because I crushed it!

04:09.166 --> 04:10.625
Yes, you, Molly,

04:10.709 --> 04:13.420
certainly crushed it on your own.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.422
What're you doing?
Why're you laughing like that? Why...

04:15.505 --> 04:18.633
It was you and your ghost-y powers!

04:18.717 --> 04:21.470
That's why I was good!
You cheated, Scratch!

04:21.553 --> 04:23.263
Why would you do that?

04:23.346 --> 04:24.723
Is it because we're friends?

04:24.890 --> 04:27.225
No! It's not, ugh... Listen!

04:27.309 --> 04:29.269
If somebody's gonna crush your spirit,

04:29.436 --> 04:31.938
it's gonna be me!

04:32.022 --> 04:33.982
Sorry, I screamed, but I just...

04:34.065 --> 04:37.444
Point is,
I cannot wait until the next game

04:37.527 --> 04:39.154
when we do it all over again!

04:39.237 --> 04:41.531
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
No, no, no, Scratch!

04:41.615 --> 04:42.741
We're not doing this again!

04:42.866 --> 04:45.827
I may have just cheated,
but I am no cheater!

04:49.080 --> 04:53.794
Molly, you said it yourself!
"Everybody deserves a chance to succeed."

04:53.877 --> 04:56.838
Well, today the Lemmings tasted victory.

04:56.922 --> 04:59.841
For the first time
in their miserable lives,

04:59.925 --> 05:01.176
they believed in themselves!

05:01.259 --> 05:03.470
- Miserable's kind of...
- And look at the parents!

05:03.553 --> 05:07.265
You wanted to enhappify Brighton, right?

05:07.808 --> 05:11.436
I know
it's, it's technically wrong to cheat,

05:11.520 --> 05:16.233
but to help Libby and the Lemmings
and Brighton...

05:16.775 --> 05:19.361
wrong feels kinda right.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.279
You just won yourself a hug.
Bring it over here.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.532
Ugh, oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

05:23.615 --> 05:25.784
But only until the Lemmings believe
in themselves!

05:25.867 --> 05:27.911
- Not one second more!
- Absolutely!

05:27.994 --> 05:30.705
And also, I stopped listening
after you said, "Wrong feels right."

05:57.858 --> 06:00.652
Lemmings, we weren't supposed to make it
to the Tournament Final,

06:00.735 --> 06:02.529
and yet here we are.

06:02.779 --> 06:05.824
Our town is proud of us. I'm proud of us.

06:05.907 --> 06:09.160
And now we are ready to face off
against our arch-rivals,

06:09.244 --> 06:10.662
the Skylarks!

06:10.745 --> 06:14.165
And it's all because
we believed in ourselves!

06:15.083 --> 06:16.376
What?

06:16.459 --> 06:18.837
Molly, we're winners because of you.

06:18.962 --> 06:20.839
The rest of us, we're still terrible.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.173
- Very terrible.
- Awful.

06:22.257 --> 06:24.301
I'm here just 'cause I like the uniforms.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.095
Look, we know we stink,
but it doesn't matter,

06:27.178 --> 06:30.640
because we've got you to mask
the scent of our incredible stinkiness.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.976
You are our team deodorant!

06:33.059 --> 06:35.020
Now let's get out there, Lemmings,

06:35.103 --> 06:38.273
and watch Molly win this championship
for us!

06:38.356 --> 06:39.858
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

06:41.026 --> 06:43.069
Hey, Moll,
look what I'm doing with my tongue!

06:43.153 --> 06:45.363
I'm cheating for nothing, Scratch.

06:45.447 --> 06:48.867
My teammates don't believe in themselves.
They only believe in... me,

06:48.950 --> 06:50.785
their team deodorant.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.204
- That's not my favorite nickname.
- Yeah.

06:53.288 --> 06:55.332
Ah, well, there's nothing you can do.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.001
Except keep on cheating!

06:58.501 --> 07:01.171
Yeah. There's nothing I can do.

07:03.715 --> 07:04.925
<i>♪ And cheat a little ♪</i>

07:06.551 --> 07:09.179
So, that was easy.
I mean, we're up 18 to zip.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.641
And now all we gotta do is
nail this one last out,

07:12.724 --> 07:15.644
and we're champions! Uh-oh...

07:15.727 --> 07:18.063
Oh, no! The Ghost Council is summoning me!

07:18.146 --> 07:20.482
What? Now? I can't do this without you!

07:20.565 --> 07:22.817
They have terrible timing!
Look, just stall,

07:22.901 --> 07:25.946
and I'll be back as soon as I can...

07:29.866 --> 07:31.576
Hey, hey, there's my guys. Look,

07:31.660 --> 07:33.703
you know, I'm in the middle of a thing
right now. It's pretty important...

07:33.787 --> 07:36.831
We just wanted to discuss
your Monthly Scare Report, Scratch.

07:37.332 --> 07:41.086
On page three,
it says you scared Billy Palmer.

07:41.169 --> 07:46.091
But then, on page five,
it says you terrified a William Palmer.

07:46.174 --> 07:49.386
Are Billy and William the same person?

07:49.469 --> 07:52.097
- I don't know. Maybe?
- They are.

07:52.180 --> 07:55.684
Which means you're one scare short
for the month, Scratch.

07:55.767 --> 07:58.561
- Scare someone.
Today!

07:59.854 --> 08:02.315
So sorry, Moll. Ghost work thing.

08:02.399 --> 08:05.819
But, good news, I'm back!
So let's just get this baby wrapped up...

08:06.736 --> 08:08.530
What the hey!

08:08.613 --> 08:12.534
You gave up 17 runs,
and the bases are loaded?

08:12.617 --> 08:14.995
- How?
- I don't know, man. I don't know.

08:15.078 --> 08:18.456
It's a blur of bats,
and balls, and humiliation.

08:18.957 --> 08:21.042
I knew you'd start losing sooner or later.

08:21.126 --> 08:24.004
Lucky for you, I'm back.
Now let's just take this jerk down.

08:24.087 --> 08:26.798
I'm thinking a fastball up her nose,
you know what I mean.

08:26.881 --> 08:30.760
No, Scratch.
I'm gonna finish this game myself.

08:30.844 --> 08:34.723
What? No! We just need one more out!

08:34.973 --> 08:36.766
Think of the Lemmings, Molly!

08:39.185 --> 08:40.687
Think of Brighton!

08:42.856 --> 08:45.275
Enhappify them!

08:45.859 --> 08:47.110
I want to enhappify Brighton.

08:47.777 --> 08:50.447
But I did all this to help the Lemmings
believe in themselves.

08:51.281 --> 08:54.117
Well, now it's time
I believe in the Lemmings.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.119
So, no more cheating!

08:56.202 --> 08:58.204
Okay. I mean, it's your loss.

08:58.288 --> 09:00.415
Literally, 'cause you will lose.

09:01.624 --> 09:04.252
Ugh! Stop talking to yourself and pitch!

09:11.509 --> 09:13.261
- I got it!
- Aw.

09:13.344 --> 09:15.597
- Ouch.

09:20.435 --> 09:22.353
Ugh! Don't worry, I got this.

09:22.437 --> 09:23.772
No, the Lemmings got it!

09:23.855 --> 09:25.148
It's going to Libby!

09:26.149 --> 09:29.527
You can do this, Libby!
Believe in yourself!

09:30.695 --> 09:31.863
Believe in yourself, believe in yourself.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.656
Oh, it's bad. I can't watch.

- it was an honest win.
- It wasn't.

was an honest win.
