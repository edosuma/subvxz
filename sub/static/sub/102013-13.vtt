Hi, Dad.

I'm fine.

No, I do not...

Nope.

Mmm.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.435
Ooh, or a boat trip.

01:00.477 --> 01:03.146
My dad has a client,

01:03.188 --> 01:05.065
a captain who
crashed his ship

01:05.106 --> 01:07.442
and is getting sued
for lost merch.

01:07.484 --> 01:10.195
500 gallons of pickles
lost at sea.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.197
Huh. Tragedy for the ages.

01:12.238 --> 01:14.657
Mm-hmm. The captain claims
that he crashed

01:14.699 --> 01:17.118
because he was blinded
by a light on Moonstone Island.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.995
I kind of want to check it out.

01:19.037 --> 01:20.455
You know, the waters around
Moonstone Island are dangerous.

01:20.497 --> 01:22.707
Ships have been crashing there
for years.

01:22.749 --> 01:25.251
Yeah. Sounds fun.

01:25.293 --> 01:26.878
And if I get this win,

01:26.920 --> 01:30.173
then I can, you know, restore
my reputation and my name.

01:30.215 --> 01:34.010
Okay. (clears throat)
But I am coming with you.

02:19.472 --> 02:21.933

02:24.477 --> 02:27.897
Found out I have
a half brother named Grant.

02:27.939 --> 02:30.483
(toilet flushes)
He had to leave,

02:30.525 --> 02:33.027
and I'll probably
never get to know him.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.947

02:42.412 --> 02:44.289
My kind of guy.

02:47.709 --> 02:50.587
I'm not sure I've fully
processed the whole thing yet.

02:50.628 --> 02:52.714

02:52.755 --> 02:55.383
Oh! Uh, before you go,

02:55.425 --> 02:57.886
do you think you could take
a passport photo of me?

02:57.927 --> 02:59.179
Now?

02:59.220 --> 03:01.306
Yeah. I mean, my hair looks
amazing,

03:01.347 --> 03:03.808
and I will never be able
to recreate this on my own.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.101
You traveling somewhere fun?

03:05.143 --> 03:08.271
Yeah. I'm thinking
of doing a solo hike.

03:08.313 --> 03:10.940
Gil doesn't know,
so don't say anything.

03:10.982 --> 03:13.443
He'll freak out
and try to talk me out of it.

03:13.484 --> 03:15.737
Why?
Probably

03:15.778 --> 03:16.779
his deep-seated
abandonment issues

03:16.821 --> 03:18.156
from our unmoored childhood.

03:19.157 --> 03:20.825
I'll miss you if you leave.

03:23.745 --> 03:26.831
It won't be forever.

03:27.790 --> 03:29.334
And besides,

03:29.375 --> 03:31.169
I am still

03:31.211 --> 03:33.129
in the process of saving.

03:35.006 --> 03:36.549
Gil!

03:36.591 --> 03:38.134
Where's my money?

03:38.176 --> 03:40.428
Uh, okay. You're at an 11,

03:40.470 --> 03:42.513
and, uh, I haven't even had
your coffee yet.

03:42.555 --> 03:45.475
What are you doing here?
Oh, seriously?

03:46.434 --> 03:48.394

03:48.436 --> 03:50.980

03:51.022 --> 03:52.982
You and Amanda.

03:53.024 --> 03:54.901
You and Gil.

03:56.819 --> 03:58.780
Where is it?

03:58.821 --> 04:01.282
About yesterday when I asked
the Hudsons for help.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.743
Let's not talk
about that right now.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.119
Hey, we should get going.
The money-- where is it?

04:05.161 --> 04:07.497
We have a date
on Moonstone Island.

04:07.538 --> 04:10.333
You have a date
on an uninhabitable island?
AMANDA: Gil!

04:10.375 --> 04:11.876
How are you
getting there?

04:11.918 --> 04:13.461
Seriously, Gil?
I figured I'd take
my dad's boat.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.505
Uh, no, you're not.

04:15.546 --> 04:16.881
Water's out
on the east side of the lot,

04:16.923 --> 04:18.216
and it's your turn
to play landlord.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.301
I'm sorry. She's right.

04:20.343 --> 04:21.719
But I can take you.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.805
I mean, it is my boat.

04:23.846 --> 04:26.641
Dad gave it to me
when he went away.
You sure?

04:26.683 --> 04:30.061
Yeah. I-I've got
nothing else to do.
(phone vibrates)

04:31.437 --> 04:34.190
Okay. I just got to...
I got to run by The Claw

04:34.232 --> 04:36.693
really quick, but I'll meet you
in the, the harbor in an hour.

04:36.734 --> 04:39.821

too much fun without me.

05:50.933 --> 05:54.187
I hope whatever that is was
worth recanting your testimony.

05:54.228 --> 05:55.355
I did

05:55.396 --> 05:57.523
one morally compromised thing,

05:57.565 --> 05:59.025
and lives were at stake,

05:59.067 --> 06:00.777
including Ace's.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.779
(sighs)
Yeah, I know.

06:02.820 --> 06:05.031
But my whole case
against Everett

06:05.073 --> 06:07.241
is blown.
Everything I was working on.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.535
Justice for Bashiir and the men
who died on the Bonny Scot,

06:09.577 --> 06:10.912

for Tiffany, and...

06:12.622 --> 06:15.124
I don't know how to fix this.

06:15.166 --> 06:16.834
I know. But I

06:16.876 --> 06:18.795
am ingratiating
myself in the family.

06:18.836 --> 06:20.671
Celia is starting to trust me.

06:20.713 --> 06:23.299
I will find another way

06:23.341 --> 06:26.260
for us to undermine the Hudsons,
I promise you.

06:27.178 --> 06:29.305
Us?
Yes.

06:29.347 --> 06:32.308
Us. I-I'm...
I'm still on your side.

06:32.350 --> 06:35.853
I-I just... just need
a second to clear my head

06:35.895 --> 06:37.855
and figure out
what-what our next move is.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.944
Is that what your reputation's
worth to them?

06:42.985 --> 06:44.654
A beanie? The Nancy I know

06:44.695 --> 06:46.406
would throw that in the trash.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.283
Yeah.
It's just, it's nice cashmere,

06:49.325 --> 06:51.452
so I'll just probably donate it
to Goodwill.

06:59.752 --> 07:02.588
Is it not enough for you
to screw up my home life?

07:02.630 --> 07:04.924
You have to rearrange
my office, too?

07:04.966 --> 07:07.510
Come on!

07:07.552 --> 07:09.303
(exhales)

07:09.345 --> 07:11.681
I was unable to sleep.

07:11.722 --> 07:13.766
And you should have a mind
to thank me.

07:13.808 --> 07:15.560
You are a business owner.

07:15.601 --> 07:18.604
You cannot be clothed
in children's outerwear.
You can't

07:18.646 --> 07:20.314
just leave my house
at night, okay?

07:20.356 --> 07:21.899
My sisters might need me.

07:21.941 --> 07:24.193
They can fend
for themselves.
And why

07:24.235 --> 07:26.279
did you buy Charlie a bird?

07:26.320 --> 07:27.572
I enjoy its song.

07:27.613 --> 07:29.157
Look,

07:29.198 --> 07:30.908
this business provides
for my family,

07:30.950 --> 07:32.410
and I need it to run smoothly.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.995
It won't run smoothly

07:34.036 --> 07:35.663
if you change
everything around!

George, I...

07:38.291 --> 07:39.625
Too late, Bess.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.210
Your lover just left.

07:41.252 --> 07:43.212
Um, actually,

07:43.254 --> 07:45.214
I wanted to talk to you.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.883
Um...

07:46.924 --> 07:48.718
I'm really sorry.

07:48.759 --> 07:51.429
Okay? I-I meant
nothing by it,

07:51.471 --> 07:52.889
and I promise
I'm gonna do better.

07:52.930 --> 07:55.349
Okay, and I'm gonna tell Nick...
Wait, no.

07:55.391 --> 07:57.977
Don't tell Nick. He'll
just be mad about the letters.

07:58.019 --> 08:00.271
Wait, are you...
are you still mad at me?

08:00.313 --> 08:02.190
Oh, my God.

08:02.231 --> 08:03.816
The letter!

08:03.858 --> 08:05.485
(laughing)

08:05.526 --> 08:07.278
Where are you going?

08:08.196 --> 08:09.947
To go hide Odette's love letter
from the Englishwoman.

08:09.989 --> 08:13.075
Maybe that'll teach her
not to mess with my stuff.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.997
She seems
really into you.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.500
Yeah, I'm into her, too.

08:20.541 --> 08:23.252
Didn't realize you two
were moving so fast.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.588
We're both capable
of surprising

08:25.630 --> 08:26.881
each other.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.799
AMANDA:
Okay, where do we start?

08:30.259 --> 08:32.053
Carson's client said
he saw a beacon

08:32.094 --> 08:34.263
coming from the lighthouse, but,
according to the Coast Guard,

08:34.305 --> 08:36.474
the lighthouse has been
inoperable for 50 years.

08:36.516 --> 08:39.435
Confirmed.
It is a pile of rubble.

08:52.240 --> 08:55.952
A pile of rubble
with fresh embers.

08:56.911 --> 08:59.997
Did someone have a bonfire here
or something?

09:03.876 --> 09:05.753
Is that blood?

09:09.632 --> 09:10.925
(twig snaps)

09:13.469 --> 09:14.887
ACE:
Hey, look at this.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.478
It's a tally mark system.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.813
The lines

09:23.854 --> 09:26.065
are in groups of seven
instead of five.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.401
Weird.
(rustling)

09:30.361 --> 09:32.530
What was that?
Wild animal?

09:32.572 --> 09:34.574
Or ghost.

09:56.887 --> 09:58.639
NANCY:
Hey, there's
the missing pickles.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.475
(rustling)

10:06.564 --> 10:08.941
Ghosts don't bleed.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.735
She's real.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.785
Hi. Are you hurt?

10:19.827 --> 10:22.663
My name's Nancy. This
is Ace and Amanda.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.874
What's your name?

10:26.250 --> 10:27.752
Birdie.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.670
Is your family with you?

10:31.047 --> 10:32.465
No.

10:32.506 --> 10:34.467
You live here all alone?

10:38.387 --> 10:40.931
Where'd you get
all this stuff?

10:43.059 --> 10:45.394
(winces)

10:45.436 --> 10:47.396
I think
she has a ligament sprain,

10:47.438 --> 10:49.565
and that infection on her leg
doesn't look great either.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.275
I'm a volunteer EMT.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.610
I can fix it!

10:52.652 --> 10:54.153
It won't hurt.
I just need supplies.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.363
NANCY:
Yeah, we can take you

10:55.404 --> 10:57.031
back to Horseshoe Bay.

10:57.073 --> 10:58.949
If you don't get help,
you could lose your leg.

10:58.991 --> 11:02.286
You'll take me back here after?

11:02.328 --> 11:04.330
To this deserted island?

11:04.372 --> 11:06.916
It's not deserted.
It's... my home.

11:06.957 --> 11:08.918
NANCY:
Yeah, okay.

11:08.959 --> 11:10.711
Let's just get you
some help first.

11:10.753 --> 11:11.754
Okay.

11:16.092 --> 11:17.802
Here.

11:32.149 --> 11:35.111
GEORGE:
Hmm. So Ace and Amanda
are a thing now?

11:35.152 --> 11:36.821
Oh, do we like her?

11:36.862 --> 11:38.698
She's competent.

11:38.739 --> 11:40.741
So the pickle jars I saw

11:40.783 --> 11:43.160
in Birdie's stash were a part
of the captain's order.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.995
Maybe she caused
the accident?

11:45.037 --> 11:46.497
We searched Missing Persons.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.040
She doesn't match
any descriptions.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.792
She seems pretty well
fed and taken care of.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.293
Couldn't have been on
the island for that long.

11:51.335 --> 11:52.753
GEORGE:
All right, so
what's the move?

11:52.795 --> 11:54.130
Detective Tamura?

11:54.171 --> 11:55.673
NICK:
Or social services.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.092
I mean, she's clearly
been through a lot.

11:58.134 --> 12:00.010
It'd be good
if she talked to someone.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.096
AMANDA:
I treated her
best I could,

12:02.138 --> 12:03.597
but she should go see a doctor.

12:03.639 --> 12:04.974
(glass shatters)

12:05.015 --> 12:06.100
(Birdie panting)

12:07.727 --> 12:09.145
(gasps)

12:12.565 --> 12:14.567
Birdie, are you... are you okay?

12:15.568 --> 12:17.945
I-I want to eat something else.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.447
Yeah, what would you like?

12:24.577 --> 12:26.412
Grilled cheese
and peanut butter.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.205
Yeah.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.541
We can make that for you.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.546
(quietly):
I think you're right
about the social worker.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.048
I'll stay with her
until somebody gets here.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.217
Yeah. I'll go
make the call.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.182
Can I use the bathroom?

12:46.223 --> 12:48.017
BESS:
I mean, come on.

12:48.058 --> 12:49.810
Who eats grilled cheese and
peanut butter sandwiches?

12:49.852 --> 12:51.395
GEORGE:
You know what's weird?

12:51.437 --> 12:53.105
I actually remember
one of my first shifts

12:53.147 --> 12:55.232
at The Claw.
There was a huge catering order

12:55.274 --> 12:56.692
for grilled cheese
and peanut butter.

12:56.734 --> 12:58.068
Gross then, gross now.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.113
I should feed
that damn bird.

13:01.155 --> 13:03.657
And George has been working
at The Claw since she was 14.

13:03.699 --> 13:06.368
That was almost
five years ago.

13:08.120 --> 13:11.332
I saw tally marks carved
into a rock on the island.

13:11.373 --> 13:14.543
It's... it's 260
rows of seven.

13:14.585 --> 13:17.004
NICK:
1,820 days.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.422
That's almost five years.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.132
ACE:
I found something.

13:20.174 --> 13:21.634
November 30, 2014.

13:21.675 --> 13:23.886
Paul Klohs,
owner of Marine Mechanics

13:23.928 --> 13:26.096
in Owl Cove, Maine,
went sailing

13:26.138 --> 13:29.183
with his wife Olivia
and daughter Elizabeth.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.976
The boat washed ashore
days later.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.019
Bodies were never found.

13:32.061 --> 13:33.145
BESS:
Her grandmother

13:33.187 --> 13:34.939
and uncle held a vigil.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.274
They served grilled cheese
and peanut butter sandwiches.

13:37.316 --> 13:38.359
And it was Elizabeth's

13:38.400 --> 13:39.652
favorite snack.

13:39.693 --> 13:41.111
NICK:
Birdie.

13:41.153 --> 13:43.614
She was never
a missing person.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.324
She was presumed dead.

13:45.366 --> 13:47.910
And somehow she's kept herself
alive this whole time.

13:47.952 --> 13:50.538
GEORGE:
Hey, has anyone seen a parakeet?

13:53.290 --> 13:55.251
NANCY:
Oh, you have

13:55.292 --> 13:56.710
a little something...

13:56.752 --> 13:58.838
(Birdie screams)

14:04.218 --> 14:05.845
(gasps)

14:07.930 --> 14:09.765
It was an accident.

14:09.807 --> 14:12.518
I'm gonna get you a clean shirt.

14:16.355 --> 14:20.109
Why? Why are you doing this?!

14:21.652 --> 14:23.654
We need to get help
for Birdie now.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.531
She's not stable.

14:25.573 --> 14:28.742
George, I'm sorry.
She killed the bird.

14:28.784 --> 14:30.202
Wait. What?!

14:30.244 --> 14:32.788
Why does it
smell like fire?

14:32.830 --> 14:33.956
Is that ash?
What?

14:35.791 --> 14:37.293
Wait.

14:39.503 --> 14:42.089
(Birdie panting)

14:46.594 --> 14:48.846
Hey.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.973
They're mad I left.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.600
Who's mad you left, Birdie?

14:52.641 --> 14:54.810
It-it smells like gunpowder.

14:54.852 --> 14:57.438
I don't think it's Birdie
that's the danger.

14:57.479 --> 14:59.148
Is there something else
here with you?

14:59.189 --> 15:01.150
Whatever it is, I'm not
letting it destroy The Claw!

15:01.191 --> 15:03.152
Okay, my loft's
mostly made of bricks.

15:03.193 --> 15:04.820
It's way more fire-resistant
than this place.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.655
Yeah, and it's nearly empty
'cause you have no tenants.

15:06.697 --> 15:09.199
What?
Does that...
hit a sore spot?

15:09.241 --> 15:11.368
Okay, hey, look,
come with me, okay?

15:11.410 --> 15:13.037
We're gonna go
somewhere safer.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.002
Amanda's on her way back
with some more clothes,

15:20.044 --> 15:21.795
but until then, here.

15:21.837 --> 15:23.631
Are you sure?
We turned the heating off

15:23.672 --> 15:26.050
to reduce, uh, fire hazards.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.055
Okay.

15:31.096 --> 15:32.890
I know that
it scares you,

15:32.932 --> 15:35.017
but can you tell me who came
back with you from the island?

15:35.059 --> 15:37.978
I call them "the fire souls."

15:38.020 --> 15:39.855
Okay.

15:39.897 --> 15:42.149
They protect me.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.234
If they protect
you, why'd they

15:44.276 --> 15:46.487
smash those plates
and kill the bird?

15:46.528 --> 15:48.364
They didn't mean to.

15:48.405 --> 15:49.782
Well, it seemed
pretty deliberate.

15:49.823 --> 15:51.367
That's why we have you
in this salt circle,

15:51.408 --> 15:52.618
to make it harder for
the ghosts to find you.

15:52.660 --> 15:54.078
You don't know them.

15:54.119 --> 15:55.579
They're my friends.
They-they wouldn't hurt me.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.122
But would they hurt others?

15:57.164 --> 15:58.832
(thunder cracks)

16:03.087 --> 16:06.340
Birdie, when was the first time
you saw the fire souls?

16:06.382 --> 16:09.426
I was in the water.

16:09.468 --> 16:12.930
I couldn't breathe.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.557
They brought me to shore,
made me a fire,

16:15.599 --> 16:18.727
and wrapped me in a blanket
with 15 stars.

16:18.769 --> 16:21.105
They saved you.

16:23.190 --> 16:25.526
What were you doing
earlier that day,

16:25.567 --> 16:26.902
before you were in the water?

16:26.944 --> 16:32.241
I opened my eyes,
and there was only water.

16:32.282 --> 16:35.119
There was no before.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.745
She's suppressing
some serious trauma.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.288
We have to get her help, but
first we need to figure out

16:38.330 --> 16:39.873
how to safely deal
with the fire souls.

16:39.915 --> 16:41.375
Did you guys learn anything?

16:41.417 --> 16:43.419
The USS Bannister
was a privateer ship

16:43.460 --> 16:45.796
that fought in the War of 1812.

16:47.172 --> 16:49.925
The crew wrecked
34 British vessels.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.885
Never left any survivors.

16:51.927 --> 16:53.929
Their motto was
"give no quarter."

16:53.971 --> 16:56.890
It means destroy everything,
leave nothing behind.

16:56.932 --> 16:58.726
(thunder rumbling)

16:58.767 --> 17:01.061
An enemy ship blew up the
Bannister with a cannonball.

17:01.103 --> 17:04.148
Killed everyone. They all died
on board in a fire.

17:04.189 --> 17:07.276
Hence their calling card
of gunpowder and ash.

17:07.317 --> 17:09.778
In 1816, a schooner named
September

17:09.820 --> 17:12.906
crashed during a storm,
and since then,

17:12.948 --> 17:15.284
there have been dozens
of shipwrecks in that area.

17:15.325 --> 17:17.286
GEORGE:
And then, in 1923,

17:17.327 --> 17:20.205
a Boston family built a private
beach house on the island.

17:20.247 --> 17:22.708
They had a big party,
but there was a massive fire.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.209
No survivors.

17:24.251 --> 17:27.671
In 1970, hilltoppers built homes
on the island.

17:27.713 --> 17:31.216
Utterly destroyed by fire again.
Also no survivors.

17:31.258 --> 17:34.094
No one's lived there since.
Except Birdie.

17:34.136 --> 17:35.512
She said the fire souls gave her

17:35.554 --> 17:38.348
a blanket with 15 stars
to keep warm.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.934
Little does she know
they're cold-blooded killers.

17:40.976 --> 17:44.646
The American flag had
15 stars in it till 1818.

17:44.688 --> 17:46.523
It could have easily
been on the Bannister

17:46.565 --> 17:48.400
in the War of 1812.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.861
The fire souls are the ghostly
crew of the USS Bannister.

17:52.821 --> 17:56.366
Uh, long-time listener,
first-time caller.

17:57.951 --> 17:59.870
They've been taking care
of Birdie for years.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.206
No wonder she's defensive
of them.

18:02.247 --> 18:04.541
But what would murderous
privateer ghosts want

18:04.583 --> 18:06.210
with a teenage girl?
I'll text Victoria,

18:06.251 --> 18:08.212
see if there's a ritual
that can help.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.547
(thunder rumbling)

18:12.549 --> 18:14.426
I need to go back
to the island now.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.929
Birdie, I need you to listen.

18:16.970 --> 18:20.140
Okay?

18:20.182 --> 18:22.017
Your name is Elizabeth Klohs.

18:22.059 --> 18:24.937
You were born
in Owl's Cove.

18:24.978 --> 18:26.855
You love to write songs.

18:26.897 --> 18:28.816
Your favorite holiday
is the Fourth of July.

18:28.857 --> 18:32.069
Five years ago, you went
on a boating trip

18:32.111 --> 18:34.154
with your parents.

18:34.196 --> 18:35.447
There was an accident.

18:35.489 --> 18:38.742
You were the only survivor.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.078
(sirens wailing in distance)

18:48.085 --> 18:50.295
I remember before the water.

18:53.757 --> 18:55.384
Mom had a picnic basket.

18:55.425 --> 18:59.179
Dad was steering toward
the shore so we could eat.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.473
And then... then we were
gonna hike.

19:03.642 --> 19:04.852
Then I was alone.

19:04.893 --> 19:06.228
(thunder cracks)

19:06.270 --> 19:08.689
NANCY:
Well, you're not alone
anymore.

19:08.730 --> 19:10.941
You have a family
who loves you.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.485
Grandma Carolyn and
your Uncle Frank.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.404
And we can take you
to go see them.

19:15.445 --> 19:17.614
But the fire souls
cannot come with us.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.408
They are putting everybody
in danger.

19:19.449 --> 19:21.743
Hey, there's a ritual
that dispels ghosts

19:21.785 --> 19:23.203
who attach themselves
to humans,

19:23.245 --> 19:24.830
but we need a totem
from Birdie's past.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.665
Something before
she met the ghosts.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.000
It'll make her harder
to recognize

19:28.041 --> 19:29.626
and them easier to trap.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.420
We need to get her
on board right now.

19:31.461 --> 19:33.797
Twitter has reported fires
all over the town.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.090
They want to
destroy the town

19:35.132 --> 19:36.508
so there's no place
for her to stay.

19:36.550 --> 19:39.178
These ghosts took care
of Birdie for years.

19:39.219 --> 19:43.432
Why would pirates, who never
do anything good, do that?

19:44.892 --> 19:47.060
Guilt.

19:47.102 --> 19:49.271
Celia told me to
light myself on fire

19:49.313 --> 19:50.606
by recanting my testimony.

19:50.647 --> 19:52.274
And then she gave me a gift.

19:52.316 --> 19:54.067
These fire souls must have
done something horrible

19:54.109 --> 19:57.321
to Birdie, something they
were desperate to walk back.

19:57.362 --> 19:58.947
What do we know
about the accident?

19:58.989 --> 20:00.616
Uh...

20:00.657 --> 20:05.245
here's what happened
to her parents' boat.

20:05.287 --> 20:06.872
NANCY:
Fire damage.

20:06.914 --> 20:10.417
Birdie, these fire souls
are not your friends.

20:10.459 --> 20:13.045
They caused the accident
that killed your parents.

20:13.086 --> 20:15.172
No.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.590
They've hidden their
true selves from you,

20:16.632 --> 20:18.550
but this is who
they really are. Evil.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.344
And we can save you from them,

20:20.385 --> 20:22.387
but we need you
to do something first.

20:22.429 --> 20:24.848
(thunder rumbling)

20:28.435 --> 20:31.396
Come on, Birdie,
hurry up, huh?

20:31.438 --> 20:34.107
I buried this after
sixth grade graduation.

20:34.149 --> 20:36.860
(wind whooshing)

20:36.902 --> 20:39.529
ACE:
A time capsule?

20:39.571 --> 20:40.781
Nice.

20:40.822 --> 20:42.282
Yeah, hold onto that.

20:42.324 --> 20:46.078
Empty rum bottle should work
for trapping pirates.

20:47.704 --> 20:49.915
GEORGE:
Okay, Birdie,
repeat after me.

20:49.957 --> 20:52.501
"I am no longer served
by these ties that bind.

20:52.542 --> 20:54.044
Rid these spirits
from my body and mind."

20:54.086 --> 20:56.380
(thunder rumbling)

20:56.421 --> 20:58.340
(wind whooshing)

21:02.719 --> 21:05.806
NANCY:
It's the fire souls.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.395
GEORGE:
They don't seem happy.
ACE: They look really mad.

21:13.730 --> 21:15.524
(gasps)

21:16.692 --> 21:18.819
BIRDIE:
They've never done that before.

21:20.028 --> 21:21.488
NANCY:
You have to send them away.

21:21.530 --> 21:24.074
I am no longer served
by these ties that bind.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.785
Rid these spirits
of my body and mind.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.626
BIRDIE: Nancy!
(Bess gasps)

21:37.462 --> 21:39.548
(panting)

21:54.229 --> 21:56.189
Why do you have that?

21:56.231 --> 21:57.524
I just did a successful ritual

21:57.566 --> 21:59.109
to detach ghosts
from a living person.

21:59.151 --> 22:01.069
Made me think
that there's still hope for us.

22:01.111 --> 22:03.030
Our spirits are entwined.

22:03.071 --> 22:05.198
That cannot be undone
with a ritual.

22:05.240 --> 22:07.534
Give that to me.
Give me my hoodies.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.911
Your raggedy scraps of fabric
can be replaced.

22:09.953 --> 22:11.747
My letter cannot.

22:11.788 --> 22:13.749
Now you know how it feels
to have someone meddle

22:13.790 --> 22:15.709
with your life.
Foolish child.

22:15.751 --> 22:18.920
I was meddled with
every day of my life

22:18.962 --> 22:20.505
until it was taken from me.

22:21.465 --> 22:24.551
Mary is the only
one who understood.

22:26.887 --> 22:29.431
She was your Nick.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.141
Yes.

22:31.183 --> 22:34.394
That letter
is all I have left of her.

22:34.436 --> 22:35.937
Please.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.155
NICK:
Hey, you okay?

22:45.197 --> 22:46.990
Yeah, everything's great.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.701
Just got go check
on my sisters, okay? Bye.

22:50.994 --> 22:52.454
(sighs)

22:52.496 --> 22:54.915
She's not great
and it's my fault.

22:54.956 --> 22:56.666
Why?

22:56.708 --> 22:59.044
It's Odette-related.

22:59.086 --> 23:00.337
You know, I have

23:00.379 --> 23:02.964
this pattern of relying

23:03.006 --> 23:05.717
on other people
to make myself feel loved.

23:05.759 --> 23:07.969
And I know it's unhealthy,

23:08.011 --> 23:12.432
but I am just terrified
of being alone.

23:12.474 --> 23:14.684
You know, and I don't
mean, like, you alone

23:14.726 --> 23:17.562
in your big, empty loft
building with no tenants in it

23:17.604 --> 23:19.189
at all 'cause, yeah,
that's your choice.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.650
I...
Okay. It's not...
It's not that I want

23:21.691 --> 23:23.527
to have the building to myself.

23:23.568 --> 23:25.779
Okay? It's that
I haven't figured out

23:25.821 --> 23:27.155
who else to let in yet.

23:27.197 --> 23:29.658
Okay?
Sure. Okay.

23:31.785 --> 23:33.870
What were you saying
about Odette?

23:37.290 --> 23:38.834
Uh...

23:38.875 --> 23:41.670
I've been writing...

23:44.548 --> 23:48.218
...the history of her life.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.678
Yeah, we did promise

23:49.719 --> 23:52.722
that we would tell her story,

23:52.764 --> 23:56.852
so I was just about to,
um, send my article off

23:56.893 --> 23:58.728
to the Horseshoe Bay Ledger.

23:58.770 --> 24:01.440
But George said that it would
just cause more trouble, so...

24:01.481 --> 24:02.899
Mm-hmm.

24:02.941 --> 24:04.860
Okay. Well...

24:04.901 --> 24:06.736
I trust George's instincts.

24:06.778 --> 24:08.530
Mm-hmm.

24:08.572 --> 24:11.116
And whatever else

24:11.158 --> 24:12.784
is on your mind...

24:14.161 --> 24:17.247
...I trust that you'll make
the right choice.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.749
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

24:19.791 --> 24:21.293
Okay.

24:21.334 --> 24:23.086
Thanks.

24:27.507 --> 24:30.093
Let's go get you
ready for bed.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.636
Hmm?

24:41.480 --> 24:43.398
We look so happy.

24:44.983 --> 24:46.401
(whispering):
Yeah, honey.

24:46.443 --> 24:48.028
Come on, honey.

24:48.069 --> 24:50.030
I'll take you to your room.

24:50.071 --> 24:52.616
(whispers indistinctly)

24:56.495 --> 24:58.455
Hey, Nancy.

24:58.497 --> 25:02.501
Did Lizzie say anything
to you about the accident?

25:03.502 --> 25:05.629
I just, uh,

25:05.670 --> 25:07.506
I don't know what
to say to her about it.

25:07.547 --> 25:10.008
Yeah, I think it's best
to just not overwhelm her.

25:11.092 --> 25:12.969
Right.

25:13.011 --> 25:17.098
Uh, here's my
cell number.

25:19.643 --> 25:23.230
Uh, you ever need a boat
repair, give me a call.

25:23.271 --> 25:24.689
On the house.

25:24.731 --> 25:27.275
Thanks. Will do.
Mm-hmm.

25:27.317 --> 25:29.236
Good luck.
All right.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.787
Hey, Ace,
can you pull up a picture

25:38.828 --> 25:40.539
of the boat after
the accident?

25:40.580 --> 25:41.873
Yeah.

25:48.338 --> 25:50.382
Yeah, that's weird.

25:50.423 --> 25:52.467
The char on the
boat from the fire

25:52.509 --> 25:56.596
is black, but then the ash
from the ghosts is gray.

25:56.638 --> 25:59.432
Could be a difference
in burn temperature.

25:59.474 --> 26:01.768
Yeah, maybe. Ah...

26:01.810 --> 26:04.771
You should change
the bandage on that.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.112
Uh...

26:14.281 --> 26:16.408
It says, "Give
no quarter."

26:16.449 --> 26:18.159
The ghosts' motto.

26:18.201 --> 26:20.787
Never leave survivors,
destroy everything.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.330
If the ghosts
caused the accident,

26:22.372 --> 26:24.666
they wouldn't have left
anything behind.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.918
No boat. No Birdie.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.129
This is a message
from the fire souls.

26:29.170 --> 26:30.839
It was not them.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.216
They didn't sink Birdie's boat.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.093
That explains the difference
between the boat char

26:35.135 --> 26:36.303
and this ash.

26:36.344 --> 26:37.512
Did anybody else

26:37.554 --> 26:39.097
ever have access to the boat?

26:39.139 --> 26:41.516
Looks like a
first-degree burn.

26:41.558 --> 26:43.101
We should keep an eye on it.

26:43.143 --> 26:45.729
The family's boat
was registered to a trust.

26:46.980 --> 26:48.940
Marine Mechanics.

26:48.982 --> 26:51.067
That's Birdie's uncle's shop.

27:17.844 --> 27:19.387
What was that hull I.D.?

27:19.429 --> 27:25.935
Uh, hull I.D. is
4258092320177.

27:28.396 --> 27:30.190
Check out this entry.

27:30.231 --> 27:32.192
The handwriting is different
than the others.

27:32.233 --> 27:34.402
You can see it in the sevens.

27:34.444 --> 27:37.739
I-- That entry also
doesn't make any sense.

27:37.781 --> 27:39.866
Impellers are supposed to be
changed every three years, max.

27:39.908 --> 27:42.410
That one says it's
five years old.

27:42.452 --> 27:45.914
A mechanic would take way
better care of his boat.

27:45.955 --> 27:49.376
ACE:
Unless someone wanted to make
the mechanic look negligent.

27:51.711 --> 27:54.214
The handwriting matches Frank's.

27:54.255 --> 27:56.216
Why go through that trouble?
(exhales)

27:56.257 --> 27:59.177
T-To cover up the fact that
you sabotaged the boat.

28:03.473 --> 28:05.558
(clattering)

28:09.813 --> 28:11.106
Coast is clear.

28:14.776 --> 28:17.696
NANCY:
Looks like there's some kind
of magnetic latch down there.

28:33.378 --> 28:35.088
(soft clicking)

28:35.130 --> 28:37.048
Um, I-I need another ear.

28:43.513 --> 28:45.014
(click)
Heard a click.

28:45.056 --> 28:46.641
Me, too.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.395
(click)
How about that?

28:50.437 --> 28:51.730
Yep.

28:52.981 --> 28:54.482
(click)

28:54.524 --> 28:55.817
There.

29:04.284 --> 29:05.452
What is it?

29:05.493 --> 29:08.246
It's a paper trail.

29:08.288 --> 29:11.875
Proof that Frank was using
the shop to launder money.

29:11.916 --> 29:13.835
Birdie's dad must
have found out.

29:13.877 --> 29:15.962
(phone vibrating)

29:17.297 --> 29:19.674
Carolyn? Hi.

29:19.716 --> 29:22.677
(gasps) I'll be right there.
Birdie's missing.

29:29.225 --> 29:31.060
You can tell us about maybe...
You were afraid that Birdie

29:31.102 --> 29:32.937
was gonna remember
that you sabotaged the boat.
What?

29:32.979 --> 29:34.397
You did something to her.
After everything

29:34.439 --> 29:35.356
this family's been through,
coming here

29:35.398 --> 29:36.941
with more of your lies?

29:36.983 --> 29:38.443
It's the truth. I have proof.
I can explain.

29:38.485 --> 29:40.320
And then recant it later?

29:40.361 --> 29:41.821
If you don't leave now,
I'm gonna arrest you

29:41.863 --> 29:43.573
for disorderly conduct.

29:46.451 --> 29:47.869
I'm sorry, Frank.

29:47.911 --> 29:50.872
Listen, what we really
need to know is,

29:50.914 --> 29:53.208
do you know anybody else who
might know where Birdie...

29:53.249 --> 29:56.336
No, no...
Her whereabouts, her friends,

29:56.377 --> 29:58.713
maybe secret hiding
places she used to go to.

29:58.755 --> 30:02.634
Uh, guidance counselors.

30:02.675 --> 30:04.719
NANCY:
Carolyn.

30:04.761 --> 30:06.679
There's something
you should see.

30:09.557 --> 30:12.352
(gasps)
Birdie gave this to me.

30:12.393 --> 30:14.896
She said she didn't
need it anymore.

30:17.315 --> 30:19.818
The others are still
looking for Birdie.

30:19.859 --> 30:21.110
I told Nancy we'd check

30:21.152 --> 30:22.821
if she came back here.

30:22.862 --> 30:24.531
What's the deal
with you and Nancy?

30:24.572 --> 30:27.200
You two ever hook up?
What?

30:27.242 --> 30:28.618
I just get a vibe.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.328
And if you did,
I wouldn't be mad at it.

30:30.370 --> 30:32.121
I mean, she is foxy.

30:32.163 --> 30:34.332
There's no vibe.
We're just friends.

30:34.374 --> 30:35.792
(door opens, entry bell jingles)

30:35.834 --> 30:37.919
Figured you'd show up
eventually.

30:37.961 --> 30:39.546
Where have you been all day?

30:39.587 --> 30:41.798
We were busy.
And where's my money?

30:41.840 --> 30:43.258
What's it for?

30:43.299 --> 30:44.509
Tampons?

30:45.802 --> 30:47.428
Fine.

30:47.470 --> 30:50.098
I'm getting my passport
and hiking Camino de Santiago.

30:50.139 --> 30:52.392
Backpacking through Europe.
(laughs softly)

30:52.433 --> 30:53.601
So basic.

30:53.643 --> 30:55.895
You know, I, uh,
I expected more

30:55.937 --> 30:57.689
from Amanda's
first big girl adventure.

31:05.655 --> 31:08.283
Why are you such a dick?

31:08.324 --> 31:09.450
Amanda and I have our own code.

31:09.492 --> 31:10.827
Codependency
is not a code.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.871
She can do whatever she wants.

31:12.912 --> 31:14.497
(laughs softly)

31:14.539 --> 31:16.583
(quietly):
Yeah.

31:16.624 --> 31:18.877
Thank you for the TED Talk.

31:29.554 --> 31:31.639
No sign of Birdie anywhere.

31:34.100 --> 31:36.561
You still thinking
about your brother?

31:38.855 --> 31:40.857
It's hard not to.

31:42.150 --> 31:45.445
Well, maybe you should
talk to your dad.

31:45.486 --> 31:46.905
He's probably feeling
the same way.

31:46.946 --> 31:48.406
What about all that
stuff this morning?

31:48.448 --> 31:51.367
Avoid it and let it blow over?

31:51.409 --> 31:52.952
Honestly, it was an out.

31:52.994 --> 31:54.871
I just didn't feel like
going there with you.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.874
I just thought we've been
talking so much...
I know.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.083
It's...

31:59.125 --> 32:00.919
It's just...

32:00.960 --> 32:04.756
we skipped over all the early
relationship weirdness

32:04.797 --> 32:06.466
and settled
right into the good.

32:09.010 --> 32:10.094
It scared me.

32:20.730 --> 32:22.774
You still scared?

32:28.488 --> 32:30.823
Birdie.

32:30.865 --> 32:34.118
I can't be here.
This is too hard.

32:35.620 --> 32:36.996
We drove on that street where

32:37.038 --> 32:39.290
my dad taught me
to ride a bike.

32:39.332 --> 32:40.667
That photo.

32:40.708 --> 32:42.877
My mom made me wear
a dress, and I didn't...

32:42.919 --> 32:45.380
I didn't want to,
and now she's...

32:45.421 --> 32:48.549
(sighs)
...now she's gone.

32:48.591 --> 32:50.677
Birdie, those memories
aren't gonna go away

32:50.718 --> 32:53.972
just because you
go back to the island.

32:54.013 --> 32:55.390
They're with you now.

32:55.431 --> 32:57.058
Y-You have to learn
to live with them.

32:59.310 --> 33:00.645
How?

33:00.687 --> 33:04.148
You stay here...

33:04.190 --> 33:05.900
and you grow.

33:08.528 --> 33:11.364
This is the place where
you're gonna make music

33:11.406 --> 33:14.617
and fall in love

33:14.659 --> 33:17.203
and watch the fireworks
on the Fourth of July

33:17.245 --> 33:18.955
with your friends.

33:18.997 --> 33:22.125
And honor your parents
and celebrate the time

33:22.166 --> 33:24.752
that you guys
had together.

33:24.794 --> 33:26.587
And become something
more than just a girl

33:26.629 --> 33:29.674
who survived a tragedy.

33:29.716 --> 33:31.467
Trust me.

33:31.509 --> 33:34.137
This is your home now.

33:34.178 --> 33:36.973
And you are so much stronger
than you realize.

33:39.684 --> 33:42.020
What about the fire souls?

33:43.479 --> 33:45.815
I made a mistake.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.817
It wasn't the fire souls
that caused the accident.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.902
All they did was save
you from drowning.

33:55.116 --> 33:57.201
(breathing unsteadily)

33:59.245 --> 34:00.997
I want to see them.

34:01.039 --> 34:05.126
It's just a little too risky.
They're really dangerous.

34:05.168 --> 34:06.878
No, it's different now.

34:06.919 --> 34:11.007
They don't need
to protect me anymore.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.383
They know that I'll be
all right.

34:13.509 --> 34:15.344
I can't make excuses
for the things

34:15.386 --> 34:17.138
that they did before
they found me,

34:17.180 --> 34:20.892
but they loved me.

34:20.933 --> 34:23.311
They're not all bad.

34:25.772 --> 34:27.440
Please. If I'm gonna stay,

34:27.482 --> 34:30.985
then I, I have to say goodbye.

34:40.661 --> 34:42.497
(sighs)

35:11.150 --> 35:13.820
(sighs)

35:29.627 --> 35:31.379
Bye.

35:39.846 --> 35:41.639
(handcuffs click)

35:41.681 --> 35:43.766
Birdie's uncle confessed
to murdering her parents.

35:43.808 --> 35:46.144
I'm not gonna ask you where
you got that file Carolyn had.

35:46.185 --> 35:48.229
I know sometimes the ends
justify the means.

35:48.271 --> 35:49.856
Just trying
to do the right thing.

35:49.897 --> 35:53.526
Just when I've written
you off, you surprise me.

35:53.568 --> 35:55.444

to Mrs. Upton.

36:11.210 --> 36:13.546
She gave me an extension.

36:13.588 --> 36:16.382
Okay, so then go do
your essay, then.

36:16.424 --> 36:17.925
Okay.

36:19.760 --> 36:21.929
Thank you, Odette.

36:21.971 --> 36:25.558
Even though an extension
is basically cheating.

36:25.600 --> 36:26.684
ODETTE:
You are welcome.

36:49.832 --> 36:53.085
It must be hell to be
here without Mary.

36:53.127 --> 36:56.923
I have become quite skilled
at the art of self-distraction.

36:56.964 --> 36:58.299
Do you think she's a ghost?

36:58.341 --> 36:59.926
Maybe I could help you find her.

36:59.967 --> 37:01.469
My friends and I are
kind of good at this stuff.

37:03.512 --> 37:05.181
Very well.

37:06.724 --> 37:08.559

I know you did what you did

It's been an intense couple
of weeks, wouldn't you say?

37:58.192 --> 38:00.486
I don't think Gil's the best
person for you right now.

And you're dealing with

Bonsoir.

38:45.614 --> 38:48.784
I respect the boundaries
you have set with George,

38:48.826 --> 38:50.578
and I will not cross
that line again.

38:50.619 --> 38:54.790
I would, however, endeavor
to maintain our friendship.

38:54.832 --> 38:58.252
Just friends.

38:58.294 --> 39:01.464
Yes, yeah, I can do that.

39:01.505 --> 39:03.215
Excellent.

39:03.257 --> 39:05.468
Shall we, as you say,

39:05.509 --> 39:08.054
"Netflix and chill"?

39:12.058 --> 39:15.353
No one would embrace
in such a familiar manner.

39:15.394 --> 39:17.772

39:37.958 --> 39:40.836
Mm-hmm.

39:40.878 --> 39:44.715
What are you drawing?

39:44.757 --> 39:47.009
I was thinking about Birdie.
Mm-hmm.

39:47.051 --> 39:49.220
And how she overcame
incredible odds

39:49.261 --> 39:51.055
because she had help, right?

39:51.097 --> 39:54.183
So imagine all the kids
that could overcome

39:54.225 --> 39:57.478
bad situations if someone
was there for them.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.855
And I got these empty units
in my new building.

39:59.897 --> 40:01.774
It's a lot of space, so...

40:04.402 --> 40:07.488
I was gonna turn them into
a youth drop-in center.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.990
I think that's amazing.

40:10.032 --> 40:14.829
Oh... okay, it will be
amazing eventually,

40:14.870 --> 40:17.706
but I got to figure
out a lot of stuff.

40:22.336 --> 40:25.881
Hey, how are you?

40:25.923 --> 40:28.050
Hell of a day, huh?
Ghost pirates.

40:28.092 --> 40:30.136
Yeah.

40:30.177 --> 40:32.304
I was thinking
about Birdie, too.

40:32.346 --> 40:33.806
Uh-huh.

40:33.848 --> 40:38.394
I know that the privateers
are unquestionably bad,

40:38.436 --> 40:41.897
but they also raised Birdie
and they changed for her.

40:41.939 --> 40:43.023
I don't know,

40:43.065 --> 40:45.901
maybe good and evil's not...

40:45.943 --> 40:48.696
is not as clear-cut.

40:52.199 --> 40:53.868

40:53.909 --> 40:56.871
What if this beanie
isn't about payment or guilt?

40:58.998 --> 41:01.125
What if it is a token of love?

41:01.167 --> 41:04.920
Nancy...

41:04.962 --> 41:06.881
as special as you are,

41:06.922 --> 41:09.717
Celia Hudson
isn't gonna change

41:09.758 --> 41:12.136
because you're
her granddaughter.

41:13.137 --> 41:15.473
I think people can
surprise you.
