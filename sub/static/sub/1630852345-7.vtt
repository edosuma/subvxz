00:30.196 --> 00:33.450
Guys, just sent our coordinates.
We need an extraction, right now.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.369
[Echo] Yeah,
that might take a little while.

00:36.870 --> 00:40.957
We kind of destroyed another plane when
the AI took it over and tried to kill us.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.501
We're plummeting towards the ocean!

00:43.585 --> 00:45.253
We're not plummeting!

00:45.336 --> 00:48.006
We ejected from so far up
that we still have, like,

00:48.089 --> 00:49.924
five minutes before we hit water.

00:50.008 --> 00:53.470
Plus, the hauler
can turn into a sub, remember?

00:54.053 --> 00:56.264
Oh… Right.

00:56.848 --> 00:58.600
Hey! While we're all on the line,

00:58.683 --> 01:01.478
we can have a good
old-fashioned leadership meeting.

01:01.561 --> 01:02.479
Oh, yes!

01:02.562 --> 01:06.983
I would love to exchange intel
in a formal yet friendly touch-base.

01:07.067 --> 01:07.901
I'll take minutes.

01:07.984 --> 01:10.361
Is that really
the best use of our time right now?

01:10.445 --> 01:14.699
Great question! Let's set up
an ad hoc committee to investigate that.

01:14.783 --> 01:17.077
Ugh! I hate leadership meetings!

01:17.160 --> 01:19.704
And Julius is terrible at taking minutes!

01:19.788 --> 01:23.374
[Julius] Sorry, Ms. Nowhere.
Would you mind repeating that?

01:25.710 --> 01:26.544

[engine starts]

01:44.437 --> 01:48.817

that finally fixed my starter. Thanks.

-[grunting, struggling]
-[tires squeal]

01:54.405 --> 01:56.950
[Gary] At the top,
we like to hear from new members.

01:57.033 --> 01:59.119
Palindrome, welcome.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.412
How about you share
what your team has learned?

02:01.496 --> 02:04.874
First, I'd like to affirm
this meeting is a wonderful idea.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.835
[Julius] Seconded, and noted.

02:06.918 --> 02:11.297
We've gathered new intel on Sudarikov's
artificially intelligent super car.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.925
-[grunting]
-[tires squeal]

02:14.008 --> 02:15.760
[grunting]

02:15.844 --> 02:18.012
The car is implanted with
my driving ability.

02:18.096 --> 02:21.516
That's why Sudarikov kidnapped me
and hooked me up to all those machines.

02:21.599 --> 02:24.102
And also why
I had to relearn how to drive.

02:24.185 --> 02:26.521
[Tony] If you ignore
the "using it for evil" thing,

02:26.604 --> 02:27.897
it's pretty flattering.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.233
That insane AI is you?!

02:30.316 --> 02:32.819
It tried to crash the spy plane
with us inside!

02:32.902 --> 02:34.571
That car did kinda seem like Tony.

02:34.654 --> 02:37.824
What? How? Frostee just said
it tried to take you out.

02:37.907 --> 02:40.702
Have you seen yourself
when you lose at The Deepening?

02:40.785 --> 02:44.539
That dumb trench glitched out right as
I was about to slay the Tentacle Thief.

02:44.622 --> 02:47.458
We had a bounty alliance
that you betrayed!

02:47.542 --> 02:48.835
Yup, there he is.

02:48.918 --> 02:52.130
We also found blueprints of
a secret base Sudarikov's using.

02:52.213 --> 02:54.173
-[grunting
-[screaming]

02:54.257 --> 02:56.843
It looks like a factory,
but we don't know what for.

02:56.926 --> 02:59.470
-[Ms. Nowhere] Where is it?
-Somewhere under the ocean.

02:59.554 --> 03:01.890
How could you possibly know that?

03:01.973 --> 03:04.851
There's a line labeled "ocean"
above the base.

03:04.934 --> 03:06.936
[sighs] Fine. Shashi's guess checks out.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.771
I'm sending you the blueprints.

03:08.855 --> 03:09.939
[alarm sounds]

03:10.023 --> 03:14.152
Uh-oh. The AI subs are back.
We're only 100 feet from the ocean.

03:14.235 --> 03:16.112
[bleeping]

03:16.195 --> 03:18.114
[dramatic music plays]

03:18.197 --> 03:21.492
And now, we've got less than a minute
before we hit water!

03:21.576 --> 03:23.661
Suddenly, this does feel like plummeting.

03:25.997 --> 03:28.791
Fifty feet! They're locking missiles!

03:28.875 --> 03:32.128
Okay. I might be able to use
a sample of the AI code

03:32.211 --> 03:34.923
I took while we were battling the car
to reprogram the subs.

03:37.091 --> 03:38.593
Almost there…

03:40.553 --> 03:41.387
[alarm stops]

03:41.471 --> 03:42.513
We're good!

03:42.597 --> 03:44.682
[dramatic music continues]

03:50.188 --> 03:52.148
-Point of order!
-Gary has the floor!

03:52.232 --> 03:56.027
I move to commend Frostee
for his outstanding work just now.

03:56.110 --> 03:59.948
Gary has moved to commend Frostee.
Does anyone second that?

04:00.031 --> 04:02.075
[bored] Hooray, Frostee.

04:02.617 --> 04:05.119
Now I hereby adjourn this dumb meeting.

04:05.203 --> 04:08.706
I'm afraid, under parliamentary procedure,
you can't adjourn--

04:08.790 --> 04:09.958
I can do whatever I want!

04:10.041 --> 04:14.128
Frostee, program those subs
to lead us back to this underwater base.

04:14.212 --> 04:16.714
We're gonna infiltrate, shut it down,

04:16.798 --> 04:20.301
and stop Sudarikov's plot
to somehow take over the world

04:20.385 --> 04:22.470
using an AI Toretto car!

04:22.553 --> 04:24.764
[Palindrome] We'll get a boat
and meet you there.

04:24.847 --> 04:27.892
No! You won't be able to
follow us underwater.

04:27.976 --> 04:31.479
Stay where you are and await orders.
Think you can handle that?

04:31.562 --> 04:35.650
Yes, Ms. Nowhere.
But let the record show that I miss you.

04:35.733 --> 04:38.820
-[Julius] I'm writing it down.
-[Ms. Nowhere] Don't write that down!

04:39.821 --> 04:42.156
I can't let Sudarikov take over the world

04:42.240 --> 04:44.200
using a car implanted with
my driving skills

04:44.284 --> 04:45.535
and ruin the Toretto name!

04:45.618 --> 04:48.621
What if Dom finds out?
I know exactly what he'd say.

04:48.705 --> 04:51.165
[imitating Dom]
"I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed."

04:51.249 --> 04:53.167
But disappointed is even worse than angry!

04:53.251 --> 04:57.255
I understand that,
but Ms. Nowhere gave us a direct order.

04:57.338 --> 04:59.132
I'm with Tony. We should go in.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.385
You've been weirdly nice lately.
It's getting annoying.

05:02.468 --> 05:06.347
You saved me from that car, Toretto,
and from myself, back in Vegas.

05:06.431 --> 05:09.809
You didn't have to either time,
but you did, and I respect that.

05:09.892 --> 05:11.311
I just hope I can pay you back.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.481
Alright, fine. I guess you can
keep being weirdly nice to me.

05:15.565 --> 05:16.941
[Layla] Y'all are both weird.

05:17.025 --> 05:20.153
It'll be a lot easier to work things out
with Ms. Nowhere in person.

05:20.737 --> 05:23.156
[sighs] I suppose you're right.

05:23.239 --> 05:25.616
I hope Ms. Nowhere's ready to RISE:

05:25.700 --> 05:30.121
Resolve, Illuminate,
Synchronize, and Empathize!

05:30.204 --> 05:32.957
[Tony] We can track
the hauler's sub location on our watches.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.083
We just need a boat.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.210
[Palindrome] The harbor's
across the island.

05:36.294 --> 05:39.047
[Layla] Along with a whole lot of people
who want to ice us.

05:39.630 --> 05:42.175
Maybe we don't need to go to the harbor.

05:45.011 --> 05:45.970
Sorry, Rusty, sir.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.848
We haven't seen Toretto.
We'll keep looking.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.100
[dramatic music plays]

05:51.726 --> 05:52.727
[yelling]

05:56.773 --> 05:59.525
Nicely done, Toretto.
Remember when I did that?

05:59.609 --> 06:01.903
I wasn't there,
but I bet it was way less awesome.

06:01.986 --> 06:04.113
He didn't crash into the front seats,
so, yeah.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.865
Now let's get to the base.

06:08.534 --> 06:12.288
Patrol Seven to base.
Good news: we found Toretto.

06:12.872 --> 06:16.167
[Rusty] But the bad news is that Toretto
has somehow located your base,

06:16.250 --> 06:18.169
and is headed toward you right now.

06:18.252 --> 06:20.505
You let them get away again?!

06:20.588 --> 06:26.469
Now, sir, I believe a quote from
Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte applies here:

06:26.552 --> 06:30.348
"Never interrupt your enemy
when he is making a mistake."

06:30.848 --> 06:33.601
Toretto ain't got the man power
to attack your base.

06:33.684 --> 06:36.437
You'll be able to take him out,
once and for all.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.898
Konechno, I will! Get out here!

06:38.981 --> 06:40.191
Yes, sir.

06:40.274 --> 06:44.278
You know, Napoleon Bonaparte
similarly relied on his right-hand man,

06:44.362 --> 06:47.281
-Louis-Alexandre Berthier--
-[snarls]

06:47.949 --> 06:50.118
[dramatic music plays]

06:50.201 --> 06:52.995
The subs are slowing down.
We must be near the base.

06:53.079 --> 06:56.332
Hopefully, with our cloaking
and replicating the subs' tech signature,

06:56.415 --> 06:58.209
we won't read as a foreign craft.

06:58.793 --> 07:01.045
[Cisco] Whoa, bro!

07:01.129 --> 07:03.464
I never thought I'd see this!

07:04.298 --> 07:06.717
We found Atlantis!

07:07.260 --> 07:08.886
[Frostee] It's not Atlantis, Cisco.

07:09.637 --> 07:11.472
[suspenseful music plays]

07:11.556 --> 07:13.683
[Echo] Security's pretty tight.

07:14.267 --> 07:18.354
This base must be connected to
Sudarikov's AI car plot.

07:19.021 --> 07:20.523
We need to destroy it.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.984
There's a control center
at the heart of the base,

07:23.067 --> 07:24.485
a couple dozen floors below us.

07:24.569 --> 07:27.155
[Frostee We can shut down
the facility from there.

07:27.238 --> 07:30.950
Looks like there's an elevator,
but I'm sure it's also heavily guarded.

07:31.033 --> 07:33.453
Just so everyone's aware,
I did inventory on the way.

07:33.536 --> 07:36.539
The fight against the AI car
decimated most of our gear.

07:36.622 --> 07:39.417
Yeah, dawg.
All I got is a bunch of spy gum.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.795
So, we need a low-tech infiltration plan.

07:42.879 --> 07:45.631
I have this addicting game on my phone
called Bubble Wrapper,

07:45.715 --> 07:47.300
where you pop virtual bubble wrap.

07:47.383 --> 07:49.385
I can leave a phone
for the troopers to find.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.221
They'll be so distracted by the game,
they won't notice us.

07:52.305 --> 07:56.309
Virtual bubble wrap?! Wouldn't the guards
wonder where the phone came from?

07:56.392 --> 07:58.853
Would we have to plant multiple phones?

07:58.936 --> 08:00.730
Do you think they grow on trees?

08:00.813 --> 08:03.107
[groans] Spy planes do.

08:03.191 --> 08:06.319
-Nope! We do this my way.

But it's still so minty fresh!

-[dramatic music plays]

08:36.098 --> 08:39.227
Uh, these uniforms look
a little big for Echo and me.

08:39.310 --> 08:40.853
And a little small for us.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.355
[Ms. Nowhere laughs]

08:42.939 --> 08:45.191
Call me Goldilocks.

08:45.274 --> 08:46.108
Wait a second.

08:46.192 --> 08:50.780
Since some of the uniforms are too small,
and some are too big, why don't we switch?

08:50.863 --> 08:55.660
[Ms. Nowhere] Mm… Maybe because
the uniforms are all the same size!

08:55.743 --> 08:58.746
-Oh… That's a good point.
-[bleeping]

08:58.829 --> 09:00.373
[Tony] Hey, guys! We're here!

09:00.456 --> 09:02.124
[Ms. Nowhere] Are you serious?!

09:02.208 --> 09:04.627
Palindrome, I told you to stay put.

09:04.710 --> 09:07.213
Do you listen to anything I say?!

09:07.797 --> 09:09.840
I don't think she's ready to RISE.

09:09.924 --> 09:13.594
A true leader
trusts her own team, Toretto.

09:13.678 --> 09:16.681
I do trust you guys,
I just want to contribute.

09:16.764 --> 09:19.809
What can you possibly contribute
by floating above us?

09:19.892 --> 09:23.563
Um, well… We can secure the perimeter.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.399
[birds caw]

09:26.983 --> 09:27.984
And it's secure.

[Ms. Nowhere grunts]

I'm disabling
the security cameras in the elevator.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.042
[Ms. Nowhere] Make your way down the hall.

09:45.710 --> 09:46.627
Copy that.

09:51.465 --> 09:53.843
[laughs] Thank you, gecko gum.

Good job thinking on your feet, Frostee.

10:56.989 --> 11:00.910
I can't believe my spy gum malfunctioned.
It must be defective.
