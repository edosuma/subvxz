00:05.434 --> 00:07.431
<i>Accessing archive data...</i>

00:07.432 --> 00:09.121
<i>Beck and Tron's resistance escalates...</i>

00:09.655 --> 00:13.321
When it goes critical,
make sure you're far away.

00:13.356 --> 00:16.288
<i>As does Paige's infatuation
with Beck's alter ego...</i>

00:16.322 --> 00:17.619
<i>the renegade.</i>

00:17.653 --> 00:22.227
- I'm going to save your life!
- It doesn't need saving.

00:22.261 --> 00:25.501
<i>Tesler rewards Paige's hard work
with praise.</i>

00:25.535 --> 00:28.171
Wipe that smirk off your face.

00:28.205 --> 00:31.339
If you had done your job,
none of this would have been necessary.

00:31.374 --> 00:34.681
- You've been sloppy lately.
- Extremely.

00:38.816 --> 00:41.346
<i>Tesler's base.</i>

00:41.380 --> 00:45.513
<i>A heavily guarded,
impenetrable fortress of death.</i>

00:45.547 --> 00:47.713
<i>There are over 20,000
soldiers on constant patrol</i>

00:47.747 --> 00:51.481
<i>who will not hesitate to
derezz you if they see you.</i>

00:51.515 --> 00:53.782
<i>So make sure they don't see you.</i>

00:55.685 --> 00:58.550
Stealth.
Now that I can do.

00:58.584 --> 01:01.483
You'll need to be quick.
The data cube we're after

01:01.518 --> 01:03.750
will give us critical
advantage over the occupation.

01:03.784 --> 01:07.684
Don't worry. They won't
even know I'm there.

01:46.683 --> 01:49.778
<i>Paige, Rox, hurry up.</i>

01:49.831 --> 01:52.545
<i>I wanna commemorate this...
our grand opening.</i>

01:55.512 --> 01:57.477
Okay, there!

01:57.511 --> 02:00.242
It's all set! Come on!

02:00.276 --> 02:02.708
Wait, not yet!
We forgot the sign!

02:02.743 --> 02:05.575
- Paige, come on!
- Okay, okay, okay!

02:15.309 --> 02:19.241
The cube he stole contains
all of our security codes.

02:19.275 --> 02:22.573
They can unlock every
system on the base!

02:22.608 --> 02:27.340
- He won't get away, sir.
- Make sure of it.

02:46.303 --> 02:49.468
A light chopper?
You'll never catch me in that.

02:51.536 --> 02:54.467
Light jets, on the other hand...

02:56.080 --> 03:05.576
<b>S01E06 - Isolated</b>

03:38.117 --> 03:39.615
Give up already!

03:49.878 --> 03:51.643
Gotcha!

03:53.910 --> 03:58.574
<i>Malfunction.
Malfunction.</i>

04:01.573 --> 04:02.672
Come on! Come on!

04:04.772 --> 04:07.603
Now would be a good time
to turn back into a baton!

04:41.523 --> 04:44.688
The end of the renegade.

04:44.722 --> 04:48.653
I wonder how general Tesler
will ever be able to thank me.

04:57.450 --> 04:59.715
<i>Pavel, over here!</i>

04:59.749 --> 05:05.346
Ooh, not enough room on
this light jet for two.

05:11.744 --> 05:13.709
Pavel! Wait!

05:13.743 --> 05:15.375
<i>Wait!</i>

05:15.409 --> 05:16.741
Hey! Wait up!

05:16.776 --> 05:18.740
Sorry I'm late. I was just...

05:18.774 --> 05:20.407
- Practicing your music.
- Practicing your music.

05:20.441 --> 05:21.639
Yeah, we know.

05:21.674 --> 05:25.405
Laugh all you want, but I think
I'm actually getting better.

05:25.439 --> 05:28.337
Listen, Paige,
you're great medic, but you're not...

05:28.371 --> 05:30.337
...programmed for music.
I know.

05:30.371 --> 05:32.602
You should really just
stick to your programming.

05:32.636 --> 05:35.401
Trust us, you'll be better off.

05:35.436 --> 05:38.334
I mean, isn't medicine...

05:43.633 --> 05:45.564
Leave us alone!

05:54.495 --> 05:55.561
Nice.

06:01.359 --> 06:04.323
Nice.

06:04.357 --> 06:07.622
<i>All available medical staff
please report to recovery.</i>

06:07.656 --> 06:09.188
Will she be all right?

06:09.222 --> 06:13.186
Some of her wounds were pretty
nasty, but... she'll make it.

06:13.220 --> 06:16.286
I guess we made easy targets.

06:16.320 --> 06:22.183
Your code is extremely complex.
I've never seen anything like it.

06:22.218 --> 06:24.282
I'll take that as a compliment.

06:24.317 --> 06:28.480
- Times are hard, ever since the war.
- Are you soldiers?

06:28.515 --> 06:32.413
Refugees. Our home city
became a target of the purge

06:32.447 --> 06:34.479
when some ISOs were discovered there.

06:34.513 --> 06:36.545
We barely made it out alive.

06:36.579 --> 06:40.376
It must have been terrifying
having ISOs in your own city.

06:40.410 --> 06:42.541
I've heard they're insane...
that they can even

06:42.576 --> 06:45.407
derezz programs with their bare hands.

06:46.608 --> 06:49.672
I'm pretty sure that's just a rumor.

06:52.538 --> 06:56.369
Flynn himself couldn't fix this mess.

07:01.501 --> 07:03.300
Whoa!

07:27.360 --> 07:28.458
<i>Hey!</i>

07:28.493 --> 07:32.424
Huh.
You're a hard program to derezz.

07:32.458 --> 07:35.522
But you know what?
I like a challenge.

07:38.156 --> 07:41.153
We've got a problem.

07:42.321 --> 07:44.452
You've got a problem.

07:44.487 --> 07:48.284
Hold on!

07:48.318 --> 07:50.216
I've gotta show you something!

07:50.250 --> 07:52.282
You think I'm that gullible?

08:00.280 --> 08:03.078
You probably thought
I forgot about this.

08:07.244 --> 08:08.209
Now will you listen?

08:09.243 --> 08:13.074
Will you just stop?
Look what's happening.

08:17.406 --> 08:19.271
It's disintegrating.

08:19.305 --> 08:22.337
The shock from my crash
destabilized the code of the island.

08:22.371 --> 08:25.069
It's derezzing, and
there's no way to stop it.

08:25.103 --> 08:28.467
Pretty soon the whole island
is going to fall apart.

08:28.502 --> 08:33.432
- Still wanna keep fighting?
- Absolutely.

08:33.467 --> 08:36.432
But I guess it'll have to wait.

08:38.465 --> 08:42.129
No way that'll ever fly again.

08:42.164 --> 08:45.195
It doesn't have to fly, just float.

08:45.229 --> 08:49.026
Look around.
There's no armies out here, no soldiers.

08:49.061 --> 08:52.292
Just us. If we wanna live,
we have to work together.

08:52.326 --> 08:57.323
I am the army, and I'm getting off
this rock... alone.

09:41.171 --> 09:43.169
Still don't think you need my help?

10:00.000 --> 10:04.830
The water's going to get even rougher
as more of the island breaks up.

10:04.864 --> 10:06.229
I might be able to
attach the propulsion unit

10:06.263 --> 10:11.027
from your chopper to my lifeboat,
modify it to work in water.

10:11.262 --> 10:14.792
Don't you need to be an engineer
to do something like that?

10:14.827 --> 10:18.957
- How hard could it be?
- It could be impossible.

10:18.991 --> 10:22.889
Look, I can't do this alone,
and neither can you,

10:22.923 --> 10:25.221
and if we don't work fast, we'll drown.

10:25.255 --> 10:28.886
At least I'll have the satisfaction
of seeing the end of the renegade.

10:28.921 --> 10:32.151
You really wanna die here?

10:36.851 --> 10:38.949
We can do this. Trust me.

10:42.148 --> 10:45.180
- You're injured.
- It's nothing.

10:48.114 --> 10:50.112
Without treatment,
you could lose the arm.

10:50.146 --> 10:52.811
I'll need to access your disc.

10:56.110 --> 11:01.009
I'm only doing this
because I need your help.

11:01.042 --> 11:03.775
So...
we are agreeing to a truce?

11:03.809 --> 11:05.941
A temporary truce.

11:09.774 --> 11:11.905
You're not gonna try to derezz me?

11:11.939 --> 11:17.736
- I have your word as a solder?
- You have my word.

11:22.967 --> 11:24.900
Where did you learn
how to do that?

11:24.934 --> 11:27.897
All soldiers learn how
to treat battle injuries.

11:27.931 --> 11:29.064
It's part of our training.

11:32.129 --> 11:35.826
Huh. Feels good as new.

11:55.052 --> 11:57.150
It's beautiful.

11:59.049 --> 12:01.780
Ah, it's... it's really simple.

12:01.815 --> 12:05.679
It's just something I made up.
I wasn't programmed for music.

12:05.713 --> 12:07.778
You could've fooled me.

12:07.813 --> 12:11.010
Well, you're obviously capable of learning
things that aren't in your programming.

12:11.044 --> 12:14.742
- Your playing proves it.
- It's not very hard.

12:14.776 --> 12:17.640
I'm sure you could learn
anything you put your mind to.

12:17.675 --> 12:22.039
Like... how to take someone down
in a single move, like you did?

12:23.071 --> 12:24.638
Why not?

12:24.672 --> 12:29.636
The key is to use your opponent's
momentum against him. Punch me.

12:35.003 --> 12:38.867
Wow! That's amazing!

12:39.901 --> 12:43.866
Let me show you again. Slowly.
Then you can try it.

12:48.866 --> 12:52.063
Oh, no.
You're an ISO !

12:52.097 --> 12:54.962
- Paige...
- That's why your code is so complex.

12:54.996 --> 12:56.729
Why didn't you tell me?!

12:56.762 --> 12:58.061
Would you have helped us if I had?

12:58.095 --> 13:00.960
She'll alert the patrols.
We can't allow that.

13:02.693 --> 13:05.858
You have to believe me, Paige.
We're not dangerous.

13:05.892 --> 13:08.690
We just wanna live in peace.

13:08.724 --> 13:11.523
Everything on the Grid,
including you and your friends,

13:11.557 --> 13:14.654
was designed by Flynn,
except for us.

13:14.688 --> 13:18.553
We're free. It's the only
reason we're being hunted.

13:19.953 --> 13:24.717
Please.
Don't say anything to anyone.

13:24.752 --> 13:27.649
I can trust you, can't I?

13:33.947 --> 13:37.776
Something on your mind?
You've been awfully quiet.

13:37.811 --> 13:40.510
I'm just tired, that's all.

13:40.543 --> 13:44.541
- How are Quorra and her friend?
- They're leaving, thankfully.

13:44.575 --> 13:45.773
I thought you liked them.

13:45.807 --> 13:49.605
I did, too, but...
they aren't who I thought they were.

13:49.640 --> 13:51.871
You mean they're not refugees?

13:51.905 --> 13:54.836
Who are they?
Why are they hiding?

13:54.871 --> 13:58.602
Look, I can't talk about it.

13:58.637 --> 14:00.902
Paige? Paige?

14:08.633 --> 14:11.597
Aida and I are leaving now.

14:16.630 --> 14:20.827
I'm sorry I won't get
to hear you play again.

14:20.861 --> 14:25.659
<i>Attention, programs. An ISO
contamination has been reported.</i>

14:25.693 --> 14:27.824
<i>Please prepare discs for scanning.</i>

14:32.691 --> 14:35.721
<i>Attention, programs. An ISO
contamination has been reported.</i>

14:35.755 --> 14:38.721
<i>Please prepare discs for scanning.</i>

14:38.755 --> 14:39.886
Sorry, Paige.

14:39.921 --> 14:43.551
Quorra, why?
Now she'll never trust ISOs.

14:43.586 --> 14:45.917
Yeah, but at least she'll be alive.

14:55.446 --> 14:58.444
Not bad... if I say so myself.

14:58.478 --> 14:59.777
Assuming it works.

14:59.811 --> 15:03.541
The power pack is drained.
It's the only one I have.

15:03.576 --> 15:06.606
My chopper has a full power pack.

15:11.737 --> 15:15.569
Suppose we make it back to
Argon together... then what?

15:15.603 --> 15:20.334
You either give yourself up
or I derezz you, your choice.

15:20.368 --> 15:21.800
Hmm. Some choice.

15:21.834 --> 15:24.632
Hand me that tail flap.
We can use it as a rudder.

15:24.666 --> 15:27.398
What, do I work for you now?

15:27.432 --> 15:30.364
Paige, look out!

15:31.765 --> 15:33.563
Paige!

15:35.783 --> 15:37.259
Paige, hang on!

15:42.832 --> 15:46.429
On your feet, program.

15:57.525 --> 15:59.457
What's going on?

15:59.491 --> 16:01.557
I'm looking for two fugitive ISOs.

16:02.724 --> 16:04.422
You're gonna tell me where they are.

16:04.457 --> 16:07.421
- I don't know.
- How did you end up here?

16:07.455 --> 16:10.420
The one called Quorra did this to me.

16:10.454 --> 16:14.353
I gave her medical aid,
and this is how she thanked me.

16:16.519 --> 16:19.417
The ISOs are crooked,
dangerous creatures.

16:19.452 --> 16:23.417
And it seems we found you just in time.

16:23.451 --> 16:26.615
Unfortunately,
we couldn't save the others.

16:26.650 --> 16:30.679
What others? What did they do?

16:30.714 --> 16:34.412
<i>Warning. ISO contamination.</i>

16:34.446 --> 16:38.576
The ISOs derezzed them,
took everything of value, then fled.

16:38.611 --> 16:40.775
<i>Warning. ISO contamination.</i>

16:40.810 --> 16:45.307
You were obviously tricked into
helping the wrong side in this conflict.

16:45.342 --> 16:47.739
<i>Warning. ISO contamination.</i>

16:47.773 --> 16:49.606
Now that you understand that,

16:49.640 --> 16:51.605
I'm willing to give you
a chance to join the right side

16:51.639 --> 16:54.437
and make the ISOs pay
for what they've done.

16:54.471 --> 16:57.435
<i>Warning. ISO contamination.</i>

16:57.470 --> 17:00.301
Under my command.

17:00.335 --> 17:03.734
How soon can I start?

17:08.400 --> 17:12.364
What are you doing?!
Come back! Ugh!

17:12.397 --> 17:15.329
I should've derezzed him
when I had the chance!

17:21.496 --> 17:24.361
Hang on, Paige.

17:27.461 --> 17:30.259
What? Come on.
Come on!

17:51.585 --> 17:52.650
There!

18:34.756 --> 18:39.164
I hope some day you realize,
I'm one of the good guys.

18:46.329 --> 18:51.225
I told you, Pavel,
never underestimate our dear Paige.

18:51.260 --> 18:53.558
We're so glad you're safe.

18:53.592 --> 18:56.590
We? I doubt that.

18:58.490 --> 19:00.355
<i> And after all that,</i>

19:00.389 --> 19:02.521
<i>I didn't even make it
back with the data cube.</i>

19:02.555 --> 19:07.453
We'll have other chances
to get our hands on Tesler's plans.

19:07.487 --> 19:11.285
But I'm impressed that you risked
your life to try to save an enemy.

19:11.319 --> 19:14.117
I thought she was starting to trust me.

19:14.151 --> 19:18.181
- Besides, I gave her my word.
- You did the right thing, Beck.

19:22.547 --> 19:26.544
So the renegade's evaded capture again.

19:26.579 --> 19:31.210
Yes. I was a fool to trust him.

19:31.244 --> 19:35.308
He betrayed me.
Just like the ISOs.

19:35.342 --> 19:40.373
But thanks to your efforts,
he didn't get away with this.

19:40.408 --> 19:43.605
Your training served me well.

19:43.640 --> 19:47.604
On the island, I thought
a lot about how I first met you,

19:47.638 --> 19:51.237
how fortunate I am to serve you.

19:53.337 --> 19:56.469
All things considered,
you've done well today.

19:56.503 --> 19:58.434
Thank you, sir.

19:58.469 --> 20:01.433
I knew when we first
met how capable you are.

20:01.468 --> 20:04.265
Even after the ISOs
betrayed you so cruelly,

20:04.300 --> 20:07.231
you showed amazing strength.

20:07.266 --> 20:11.662
I find strength in knowing
that you would never betray me, sir.

20:29.823 --> 20:31.966
<i>And you say her name was Quorra?</i>

20:32.286 --> 20:34.286
She and her friend
were treated right here.

20:34.424 --> 20:36.257
They just left a few micros ago.

20:36.737 --> 20:38.101
You've done the right thing.

20:40.312 --> 20:42.790
Tear this place apart,
erase any trace of their presence,

20:44.155 --> 20:47.129
and round up every program
that's been exposed to the ISOs

20:47.328 --> 20:49.323
and have them derezzed immediately.

20:49.531 --> 20:50.589
What?!

20:50.834 --> 20:52.784
Collaborating with
traitors must be punished,

20:53.059 --> 20:56.174
as an example to anyone else
who might consider helping them.

20:56.473 --> 20:58.161
I'm afraid that includes you.

20:58.237 --> 20:59.641
But we helped you!

21:03.950 --> 21:05.745
<i>- But we helped you!
- Please!</i>

21:13.193 --> 21:14.909
I would never betray you, Paige.

21:16.024 --> 21:18.861
I know all to well
what you're capable of.
