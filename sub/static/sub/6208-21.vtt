WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:03.760
I say this because I love you Salem.

00:03.870 --> 00:05.860
It's time you experimented with a new fur colour,

00:05.860 --> 00:07.020
you need to update your look.

00:07.400 --> 00:09.410
But basic black is always in fashion.

00:09.410 --> 00:10.610
How about going blonde?

00:10.610 --> 00:12.380
You'd fit in better with the rest of the family.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.380
Please, think of the roots.

00:14.680 --> 00:16.260
But I wanna do something.

00:16.260 --> 00:17.120
Come on, I'm bored.

00:17.120 --> 00:17.870
All right,

00:17.870 --> 00:20.850
I'll agree to a henna rinse to bring out my natural red highlights

00:20.850 --> 00:21.520
but that's it.

00:21.520 --> 00:23.520
Okay, henna it is.

00:23.520 --> 00:25.520
And you're sure you know what you're doing?

00:25.520 --> 00:27.520
I triple checked the magic book.

00:27.810 --> 00:29.710
Okay, now get ready to look gorgeous.

00:29.710 --> 00:31.710
Don't I at least get a magazine?

00:32.700 --> 00:33.930
All done.

00:33.930 --> 00:35.050
I'm tingling.

00:35.050 --> 00:36.230
Let's see the new you.

00:36.230 --> 00:37.710
I think it worked.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.110
O-ho what?

00:41.510 --> 00:42.800
I'm naked!

00:42.800 --> 00:44.150
Don't panic, I can fix this.

00:44.150 --> 00:44.840
How?

00:44.840 --> 00:45.990
I'll go get my aunts.

00:46.220 --> 00:49.010
And a sweater, I'm freezing my tail off

00:57.970 --> 01:01.230
1x21. As Wetsbridge turns

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074

01:16.650 --> 01:17.780
Hey!

01:17.780 --> 01:19.500
Hey Jenny, what's new?

01:19.500 --> 01:21.500
Nothing. Nothing's ever new.

01:21.500 --> 01:24.290
Well we're going to science, maybe something'll blow up.

01:24.940 --> 01:26.850
All right quiet, focus.

01:27.080 --> 01:29.920
Today we're going to be looking at the Endocrine system,

01:29.920 --> 01:31.350
which includes the thyroid,

01:31.410 --> 01:34.490
the pancreas and the islets of Langerhans,

01:34.490 --> 01:36.860
where I spent my summer vacation.

01:38.130 --> 01:39.970
Hello! Is this thing on? Hello!

01:41.150 --> 01:44.560
Fish sticks again. We measure out our lives in fish sticks.

01:44.560 --> 01:46.390
They're not so bad. Look.

01:46.390 --> 01:49.610
Fishhenge, a deep fried tribute to the druids.

01:49.610 --> 01:52.190
Hey, here comes Harvey, maybe he's got exciting news.

01:52.190 --> 01:53.520
I do.

01:53.520 --> 01:54.230
See?

01:54.230 --> 01:56.160
Yeah, I just got my car realigned.

01:56.160 --> 01:58.080
It used to veer slightly to the left,

01:58.080 --> 01:59.040
and now it doesn't.

01:59.310 --> 02:00.460
That's it?

02:00.460 --> 02:02.720
Okay we are now officially in a rut.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.720
We have the most exciting news!

02:04.720 --> 02:05.540
Not you.

02:05.540 --> 02:08.580
We've been asked to join the teen-board of Drake's department store.

02:08.610 --> 02:12.000
And guess who's modelling formal wear in the school courtyard tomorrow night?

02:12.000 --> 02:12.540
Me!

02:12.540 --> 02:13.090
And me!

02:13.090 --> 02:14.340
Why are you telling us?

02:14.340 --> 02:16.170
We're not telling you,

02:16.170 --> 02:17.700
we're telling Harvey.

02:17.700 --> 02:20.300
We really need boys to volunteer as escorts.

02:20.490 --> 02:21.870
Don't look at me,

02:21.980 --> 02:25.200
the only statement I want my clothes to make is 'Please don't stare.'

02:25.200 --> 02:27.800
But you get to wear a tux and super-shiny shoes.

02:27.960 --> 02:30.670
I'd have to lose my mind before I'd do something like that.

02:30.760 --> 02:32.670
Well let me know if you do.

02:34.870 --> 02:36.530
Why do they get to have all the fun?

02:38.380 --> 02:39.560
Hello.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.640
Welcome home sunshine,

02:41.950 --> 02:43.640
how was your day?

02:43.640 --> 02:45.180
Here's a quick recap.

02:45.180 --> 02:48.700
There was boredom followed by dullness with a dash of egh!

02:48.700 --> 02:50.390
It can't be that bad?

02:50.390 --> 02:52.990
I'm actually looking forward to my flu shot tomorrow.

02:52.990 --> 02:54.990
If you're bored, you know who's to blame.

02:56.160 --> 02:57.510
No, yourself.

02:57.510 --> 03:00.090
You have to make your own excitement.

03:00.090 --> 03:02.690
For example, I'm working on a theory of inertia

03:02.690 --> 03:03.890
and I just can't stop.

03:03.890 --> 03:05.530
You're worse off than me.

03:05.530 --> 03:07.230
If I had a life I'd give you half.

03:07.230 --> 03:09.600
Hey I've got a sure fire way to make time fly.

03:09.600 --> 03:10.740
Lint spotting.

03:10.740 --> 03:11.730
Lint spotting?

03:11.730 --> 03:13.380
Yeah, you pick out a piece of lint

03:13.380 --> 03:14.600
and track it through the air.

03:14.600 --> 03:15.620
Try it.

03:16.060 --> 03:18.360
All right, but only because I'm disparate.

03:18.360 --> 03:20.640
Oh, there's a good one,

03:20.640 --> 03:22.420
follow it. Up. Up. Down.

03:22.420 --> 03:24.720
Down to the right. Oh it's a feisty one.

03:25.100 --> 03:26.760
I'm going to find aunt Hilda.

03:26.760 --> 03:30.860
Oh up again. Twirling. Twirling. Hey there's two in play!

03:30.960 --> 03:34.090
Don't believe him, every kiss from Blake is a lie.

03:34.090 --> 03:35.360
What are you watching?

03:35.360 --> 03:38.160
My favourite soap opera. 'The Burden of Desire'

03:38.160 --> 03:40.160
Catch me up while they jacuzzi.

03:40.160 --> 03:40.920
Okay,

03:41.050 --> 03:46.370
Blake just quit Sherman Enterprises in anger precipitating a family crisis in which Norma turned to Frank,

03:46.370 --> 03:47.470
not Nick, for comfort.

03:47.790 --> 03:49.410
Now that's a Thursday.

03:49.410 --> 03:52.010
Why can't my life be exciting like that?

03:52.010 --> 03:52.620
It can.

03:52.620 --> 03:53.580
Really! How?

03:53.580 --> 03:54.810
Use a spell.

03:57.560 --> 04:00.580
Worms? What am I supposed to do with a can o' worms?

04:00.580 --> 04:03.210
Open it. All emotions will become heightened

04:03.400 --> 04:04.370
but be careful,

04:04.370 --> 04:04.970
remember

04:04.970 --> 04:07.570
you have to take the good with the bad.

04:07.570 --> 04:10.220
Gimme, I'll take whatever I can get.

04:14.580 --> 04:15.640
Hey!

04:15.640 --> 04:17.440
Hey, what's new?

04:17.440 --> 04:18.459
Nothing.

04:18.459 --> 04:19.600
Are you sure?

04:19.600 --> 04:22.200
Sabrina, today will be a day just like any other.

04:22.890 --> 04:25.130
Out of my way, code blue, stat!

04:25.130 --> 04:26.660
What's going on?

04:26.660 --> 04:28.660
Pops, the janitor just collapsed.

04:28.660 --> 04:30.660
And we have excitement.

04:32.010 --> 04:34.270
Sabrina, at last I've found you.

04:34.270 --> 04:35.110
We need to talk

04:35.110 --> 04:36.170
in private.

04:36.850 --> 04:38.170
Is something wrong?

04:38.170 --> 04:41.150
No, something's right, very right.

04:41.150 --> 04:45.090
Just say you'll meet me by the reflecting pool in the courtyard at twelve thirty-six.

04:45.090 --> 04:46.930
Twelve thirty-six? That's really specific.

04:46.930 --> 04:47.670
It's important.

04:47.670 --> 04:48.650
Okay.

04:49.560 --> 04:50.650
The bell!

04:50.650 --> 04:51.550
We must go.

04:51.550 --> 04:52.740
I'm so happy.

04:54.940 --> 04:56.710
But not for long.

04:58.110 --> 05:01.450
Now we've been dancing around it all year, so let's get to it.

05:01.470 --> 05:03.690
Today we're going to study reproduction.

05:04.830 --> 05:07.310
Yeah! Whoo! Alright!

05:07.310 --> 05:12.060
So then the sperm hits the ovum

05:12.060 --> 05:14.100
and embryo genesis

05:14.100 --> 05:15.010
begins.

05:17.960 --> 05:20.020
Well, that's all we have time for today.

05:21.040 --> 05:22.610
You can go now.

05:24.510 --> 05:26.400
Until twelve thirty-six, my darling.

05:26.880 --> 05:28.180
See ya.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.220
Oh Gene.

05:35.420 --> 05:38.620
Oh we shouldn't, we mustn't. Not during school hours.

05:38.620 --> 05:41.220
I just can't control myself around you Gene.

05:41.780 --> 05:43.600
I'm here for my flu shot.

05:45.170 --> 05:47.930
Ah, Mr. Pool, your blood pressure is normal.

05:47.930 --> 05:49.780
Thank you for squeezing me in.

05:50.840 --> 05:52.780
Come on, I'll give you your flu shot.

05:53.730 --> 05:55.720
So, are you and Mr. Pool dating?

05:55.720 --> 05:57.720
No! Course not.

05:58.560 --> 06:01.340
And if the school board knew anything about this,

06:01.340 --> 06:02.320
we'd both be out of jobs.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.070
Do you understand?

06:03.070 --> 06:03.760
Yes.

06:03.760 --> 06:05.880
Good, now give me your arm.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.880
I promise this wont hurt.

06:09.060 --> 06:10.390
All done.

06:10.390 --> 06:12.390
Would you like a cold compress?

06:12.390 --> 06:14.900
I don't have time. It's twelve thirty, I have to get to Harvey.

06:18.780 --> 06:20.860
I thought you weren't going to make it.

06:21.740 --> 06:24.040
A bandaid! Who did this to you?

06:24.270 --> 06:26.040
The nurse, I had a flu shot.

06:26.040 --> 06:27.530
Oh, okay.

06:27.530 --> 06:30.140
So what did you wanna tell me that couldn't wait till twelve thirty-seven?

06:30.140 --> 06:32.820
Something I should have said a long time ago.

06:33.100 --> 06:34.820
I think we should go steady.

06:34.820 --> 06:36.980
Steady? I'd like that.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.420
I'd like that a lot.

06:38.420 --> 06:41.920
And I want to give you something so we'll never forget this moment.

06:42.490 --> 06:44.410
A bracelet! It's beautiful.

06:44.410 --> 06:45.810
Read the inscription.

06:45.810 --> 06:47.810
Harvey digs Sabrina.

06:47.810 --> 06:49.230
Look on the back.

06:49.650 --> 06:51.230
Twelve thirty-six?

06:51.230 --> 06:53.960
That's what time it was when we first spoke,

06:53.960 --> 06:56.430
in the cafeteria on your first day at school.

06:56.430 --> 06:58.430
Oh Harvey, it's perfect.

06:58.430 --> 07:00.430
No, you're perfect.

07:03.350 --> 07:05.520
Libby! We shouldn't be in here.

07:05.520 --> 07:06.810
Stool softener? Ew!

07:07.680 --> 07:09.520
What are you looking for?

07:09.520 --> 07:11.500
A way to bring Sabrina Spellman down.

07:11.500 --> 07:14.020
I'm going to plant something of Mr. Pool's on her,

07:14.020 --> 07:16.200
then sit back and watch her take the fall.

07:16.410 --> 07:18.200
You are pure evil.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.350
Thanks.

07:19.350 --> 07:22.530
Now if I can just find the answer key to next weeks test,

07:22.530 --> 07:24.300
or something even better.

07:24.900 --> 07:27.110
Like a diamond ring.

07:27.110 --> 07:29.850
What's Mr. Pool doing with a diamond ring?

07:29.950 --> 07:31.100
Dreaming.

07:31.100 --> 07:32.250
Do you hear something?

07:32.250 --> 07:33.400
We gotta get outa here.

07:48.710 --> 07:49.890
Ah! Wasp!

07:53.120 --> 07:55.960
Excuse me, have you seen the new janitor?

07:57.150 --> 08:00.430
You're looking at him. People call me Stone,

08:00.430 --> 08:01.820
Stone Burton.

08:01.820 --> 08:04.720
I came to Westbridge looking for a second chance.

08:04.720 --> 08:06.590
Then er, don't eat the meat-loaf.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.710
Anyway, I saw a wasp in my office.

08:08.710 --> 08:09.740
It's got me worried,

08:09.740 --> 08:11.220
I think there might be a nest.

08:11.300 --> 08:12.730
A wasps nest,

08:12.730 --> 08:14.370
that could be deadly.

08:14.530 --> 08:16.370
Let's hope you're wrong.

08:22.300 --> 08:23.820
Well, here we are,

08:23.820 --> 08:25.580
back to where it all started.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.580
Mmm, good sloppy Joe.

08:27.580 --> 08:30.260
I just heard the most amazing thing.

08:30.260 --> 08:33.659
Did you know FDR had three vice presidents?

08:34.169 --> 08:37.799
John S, Garner, Henry Wallace and Harry Truman.

08:38.049 --> 08:40.429
Well that's all, see ya.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.799
Wow! Libby was friendly.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.800
A little too friendly.

08:46.340 --> 08:47.670
Aaah! Wasps.

08:47.670 --> 08:50.250
Keep them away from me, I'm terribly allergic.

08:53.270 --> 08:55.040
What happened?

08:55.040 --> 08:56.770
She's in epileptic shock!

08:56.770 --> 08:58.320
I have to get her to the nurse.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.190
Wait for me.

09:01.190 --> 09:02.410
I will.

09:04.990 --> 09:06.640
Help! Help!

09:06.980 --> 09:08.410
Wasp sting.

09:08.410 --> 09:09.990
Put her over here.

09:11.880 --> 09:15.240
She needs Epinephrine and she needs it now.

09:15.550 --> 09:17.240
Don't you quit on me!

09:21.250 --> 09:22.340
There.

09:22.340 --> 09:23.200
Where am I?

09:23.200 --> 09:24.750
The Nurses office.

09:24.750 --> 09:27.720
You're going to make it thanks to this young man.

09:27.930 --> 09:29.720
Oh Harvey, I...

09:29.720 --> 09:30.890
You need to rest.

09:30.890 --> 09:32.070
Help me get her to a bed.

09:33.320 --> 09:34.670
Hows Pops?

09:34.670 --> 09:36.630
His heart is weak but he's a fighter.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.910
I'll go get a cold compress.

09:40.350 --> 09:41.880
As long as you're okay,

09:41.880 --> 09:43.110
I'll be getting back to lunch.

09:43.110 --> 09:44.100
Don't go,

09:44.100 --> 09:45.790
stay with me Harvey.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.290
No, I have to follow my heart and return to Sabrina.

09:49.290 --> 09:51.290
I don't know what you see in her.

09:51.290 --> 09:53.290
I don't know what you don't.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.530
How annoying!

10:06.120 --> 10:07.390
Good day.

10:07.390 --> 10:08.780
It is, isn't it.

10:10.550 --> 10:12.560
Rogue ladder, look out.

10:19.330 --> 10:20.840
Good lord,

10:21.390 --> 10:23.700
now I have to move again.

10:25.990 --> 10:27.040
Incoming!

10:27.850 --> 10:29.230
What happened to Harvey?

10:29.230 --> 10:31.050
He took a ladder to the head.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.290
He's in your hands now.

10:33.290 --> 10:34.800
I'll go get a cold compress.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.100
Is that all you do?

10:36.100 --> 10:38.100
My hands are tied by the state.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.940
Harvey! Harvey speak to me.

10:43.630 --> 10:44.630
Hey!

10:44.630 --> 10:46.570
Harvey, you're awake.

10:46.570 --> 10:47.940
Who's Harvey?

10:47.940 --> 10:49.340
You don't know who you are?

10:49.340 --> 10:51.340
No. Who are you?

10:51.340 --> 10:53.110
I'm Libby, don't you remember?

10:53.110 --> 10:55.360
Actually I don't remember anything.

10:55.600 --> 10:56.940
Amnesia,

10:56.940 --> 10:58.440
I can work with this.

10:59.500 --> 11:02.830
Listen, no matter what anyone says, I'm your girlfriend.

11:02.830 --> 11:05.590
I'm the only one you can trust, you got that?

11:05.590 --> 11:06.900
And you are?

11:07.830 --> 11:09.920
Harvey, I've just heard. Are you okay?

11:09.920 --> 11:11.750
Yeah. Who are you?

11:11.750 --> 11:14.410
You don't know me? I'm Sabrina, your girlfriend.

11:14.410 --> 11:16.090
I don't think so.

11:16.170 --> 11:17.690
This is my girlfriend.

11:19.060 --> 11:20.320
Yeah, Libby.

11:29.410 --> 11:32.070
Oh no, Harvey has amnesia.

11:32.070 --> 11:34.070
This can't be happening.

11:34.070 --> 11:35.840
It can and is.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.280
Now I think you'd better go,

11:37.280 --> 11:40.180
my boyfriends had enough excitement for one day.

11:40.180 --> 11:41.220
But Harvey!

11:41.260 --> 11:42.460
Nice meeting you.

11:42.460 --> 11:44.340
What are you doing?

11:44.340 --> 11:45.510
Ruining your life.

11:45.510 --> 11:46.900
Now if you'll excuse me

11:46.900 --> 11:50.330
I have to go remind Harvey about being in the fashion show.

11:50.330 --> 11:51.980
You're going to make him wear a tux?

11:51.980 --> 11:55.170
And a cummerbund and you can't stop me.

11:57.810 --> 11:59.640
I can't believe Libby did that.

11:59.640 --> 12:02.840
And now the whole schools going to see them together tonight at the fashion show.

12:02.840 --> 12:06.340
Don't worry, I've got a plan. She'll get hers.

12:06.340 --> 12:07.210
What d'you mean?

12:07.210 --> 12:09.460
If I told you, you'd only try to stop me.

12:09.460 --> 12:11.460
Just be at the fashion show.

12:13.260 --> 12:14.610
Be careful.

12:16.590 --> 12:18.660
Of course I can't offer you riches,

12:18.660 --> 12:20.740
until society decides to reward it's teachers,

12:20.740 --> 12:22.840
but I can offer you this.

12:22.840 --> 12:24.840
Nancy, would you be my...

12:24.840 --> 12:26.180
Gene!

12:26.180 --> 12:27.270
It's empty.

12:27.270 --> 12:28.340
What!

12:30.980 --> 12:32.630
Don't you understand,

12:32.630 --> 12:35.210
I gave up professional hair cuts to buy that ring?

12:35.210 --> 12:38.120
I can see that sir, but let's stick to the facts.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.610
Who has access to your room?

12:39.680 --> 12:40.410
Everyone.

12:40.570 --> 12:42.310
I don't lock my door,

12:42.310 --> 12:43.770
I'm always here.

12:43.770 --> 12:47.030
Except I had to stop by the nurses office today.

12:47.030 --> 12:49.030
Can you pin-point the time you were out?

12:49.030 --> 12:51.330
Between twelve thirty and twelve forty.

12:51.330 --> 12:52.700
Lock the exits,

12:52.840 --> 12:55.620
I'm going to crack this case if I have to search everyone on campus.

12:57.140 --> 12:59.290
How could Harvey forget me?

12:59.290 --> 13:01.320
And what is Libby's scheme?

13:01.320 --> 13:04.500
This spell is taking some strange twists and turns,

13:05.020 --> 13:07.390
but it sure makes a good cup of coffee.

13:07.390 --> 13:08.960
Excuse me ma'am.

13:08.960 --> 13:11.170
You mean me? Oh, you mean me?

13:11.170 --> 13:13.170
We'd like permission to search your back-pack.

13:13.170 --> 13:14.940
Oh, I see no reason to disturb Sabrina,

13:14.940 --> 13:16.070
she's one of my best students.

13:16.070 --> 13:17.720
Oh, it's okay Mr. Pool,

13:17.720 --> 13:18.990
go ahead.

13:19.230 --> 13:20.990
So, what you looking for?

13:21.410 --> 13:22.990
This.

13:23.960 --> 13:26.490
Sabrina, how could you! You stole my ring.

13:26.490 --> 13:27.490
I didn't!

13:27.490 --> 13:30.690
I'm calling your legal guardians and bringing you down town.

13:30.690 --> 13:32.380
What? Why? How?

13:32.380 --> 13:33.900
I'll ask the questions.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.500
This is a mistake, I've never stole anything in my whole life.

13:36.500 --> 13:37.900
We'll discuss it at the station.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.900
But I don't know how that ring got in my bag.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.730
Libby, she set me up.

13:42.730 --> 13:45.630
You've got the wrong person. Get her! Get her! Get her! Get her! Get her!

13:46.970 --> 13:48.490
Bye bye.

13:49.060 --> 13:51.920
Where were you today between twelve thirty and twelve forty?

13:51.920 --> 13:53.480
In the courtyard with Harvey.

13:53.480 --> 13:54.390
Any witnesses?

13:55.130 --> 13:57.230
Any witnesses who can remember their own name?

13:57.230 --> 13:59.610
No, but I have proof.

13:59.610 --> 14:00.490
Look!

14:01.040 --> 14:03.290
Oh no, my bracelets gone,

14:03.290 --> 14:06.280
but it was engraved with the exact time Harvey gave it to me, twelve thirty-six.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.290
Which would make for the perfect alibi,

14:08.290 --> 14:10.290
if such a bracelet existed.

14:10.830 --> 14:12.690
Now let's starts from the top.

14:15.130 --> 14:16.380
And who are you?

14:16.380 --> 14:19.260
We're Sabrina's aunts. Has she been charged?

14:19.260 --> 14:20.400
Not formaly.

14:20.400 --> 14:22.400
May we speak to her alone detective?

14:22.950 --> 14:26.190
Sure, maybe you can get a straight answer out of her.

14:29.980 --> 14:31.840
Sabrina, what's going on?

14:31.840 --> 14:34.140
It's this spell, it's totally out of control. Make it stop.

14:34.140 --> 14:35.260
We can't do that.

14:35.260 --> 14:36.380
You opened a can of worms

14:36.380 --> 14:39.440
and until they wriggle their way to a dramatic climax you're stuck.

14:39.440 --> 14:41.380
But I am in so much trouble.

14:41.380 --> 14:44.160
The police think I stole the ring Mr. Pool bought for the nurse

14:44.160 --> 14:45.950
but Libby's seting me up to get me out of the way

14:45.950 --> 14:47.960
because she wants to steal my boyfriend who has amnesia.

14:47.960 --> 14:50.230
Oh this is even better than 'Burden of Desire'...

14:50.640 --> 14:52.230
Except that it's happening to you.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.090
The place is really filling up.

14:58.780 --> 15:00.600
Five minutes to show time

15:00.600 --> 15:03.760
and please remember, you're Drake girls now.

15:07.270 --> 15:09.170
Harvey, You look cute

15:09.510 --> 15:10.390
and...?

15:10.600 --> 15:11.800
How about me?

15:11.800 --> 15:13.520
Ah, you look great...

15:16.670 --> 15:19.460
just a little more, there.

15:20.420 --> 15:23.350
She's not going to steal Sabrina's boyfriend.

15:25.660 --> 15:30.550
Now all I have to do is crawl through this duct to the vent overlooking the fashion show

15:30.550 --> 15:32.310
and then we'll see who's face is red...

15:32.690 --> 15:34.310
and glossy.

15:37.410 --> 15:40.980
Okay, you have fifteen minutes to find the bracelet.

15:42.210 --> 15:44.330
It should be somewhere around here.

15:44.330 --> 15:46.600
I'm almost positive I had it in the cafeteria.

15:46.670 --> 15:48.070
Hey look!

15:48.070 --> 15:50.540
Oh wait, it's just a gum wrapper.

15:50.540 --> 15:52.540
A gum wrapper won't save me now.

15:53.750 --> 15:56.140
Let's get things started with Jill and Chet.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.280
We must talk.

15:59.280 --> 16:01.280
Meet me by the pool after the show.

16:01.280 --> 16:02.840
I can't wait that long.

16:02.840 --> 16:03.850
Shh! Fashion.

16:08.450 --> 16:10.860
I've found a missing ear-ring, my lost sun-glasses,

16:10.860 --> 16:11.820
an overdue library book,

16:11.820 --> 16:13.890
which would all be great if I wasn't going to jail!

16:13.890 --> 16:15.940
Oh, there's the hunky janitor,

16:15.940 --> 16:16.760
he'll help us.

16:16.760 --> 16:19.070
Sir, have you seen a bracelet?

16:20.140 --> 16:21.890
I've seen a lot of things...

16:22.150 --> 16:23.890
but no bracelet.

16:23.890 --> 16:26.490
Are you sure, it's silver and has an alibi engraved on it?

16:26.490 --> 16:28.420
I'd like to help you ma'am

16:28.420 --> 16:30.410
but this entire schools in danger. You see,

16:30.410 --> 16:32.410
I'm huntin' wasps.

16:34.500 --> 16:37.160
Then it's over, it's hopeless.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.160
We'll never find my bracelet.

16:40.670 --> 16:41.630
Now Harvey,

16:42.160 --> 16:45.420
I don't wanna overload you but there's one more thing you have to remember.

16:45.420 --> 16:46.060
What?

16:46.060 --> 16:47.810
When we get to the end of the runway

16:47.810 --> 16:49.170
you have to kiss me.

16:49.170 --> 16:49.920
Okay.

16:49.920 --> 16:52.060
Oh, this is the best night of my life,

16:52.500 --> 16:54.060
total control.

16:55.050 --> 16:57.320
Twenty more yards and it's splatterday.

16:59.540 --> 17:00.910
What was that?

17:00.910 --> 17:02.250
A wasp!

17:02.890 --> 17:05.579
Help! Somebody HELP!

17:05.579 --> 17:07.480
Jenny, in the ceiling, do something.

17:07.530 --> 17:10.480
Don't worry, stand back. I've got a ladder and I know how to use it.

17:11.079 --> 17:12.480
Hang on Jenny.

17:13.270 --> 17:14.880
All right, I've got her.

17:15.550 --> 17:16.490
No I don't.

17:16.490 --> 17:18.490
Jenny! Are you okay?

17:18.490 --> 17:20.490
Yes, my hair broke my fall.

17:20.490 --> 17:22.490
My bracelet! You found my bracelet.

17:22.490 --> 17:25.390
Look, Harvey digs Sabrina, twelve thirty-six.

17:25.390 --> 17:28.690
Okay your story check out, you're off the hook.

17:28.690 --> 17:30.990
But you young lady have some explaining to do.

17:31.340 --> 17:32.960
We have to evacuate the area,

17:32.960 --> 17:34.960
there's a swarm headed this way.

17:34.960 --> 17:35.930
Wait!

17:36.140 --> 17:36.930
I can't wait,

17:36.930 --> 17:38.530
I have to get to Harvey and make him remember.

17:38.530 --> 17:40.440
But first you have to look fabulous.

17:42.150 --> 17:43.050
Wow!

17:43.050 --> 17:47.050
Our next couple is dressed for a magical night,

17:47.050 --> 17:50.150
representing the sophomore class, Harvey and Libby.

17:55.260 --> 17:57.430
Aren't I supposed to kiss you now?

17:57.430 --> 17:59.150
Oh Harvey, you remembered.

18:00.210 --> 18:01.150
Stop!

18:01.150 --> 18:03.450
You can't kiss him, Harvey's my boyfriend.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.750
What are you doing here, I thought I sent you to juvie.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.250
Your little scheme failed

18:07.250 --> 18:09.550
and now I'm back to reclaim what's rightfully mine.

18:09.550 --> 18:10.790
Look.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.430
Harvey digs Sab..

18:12.590 --> 18:15.690
I'm Harvey and I dig Sabrina, that's right!

18:16.030 --> 18:19.520
And Roger Clements signed for the Bluejay's, it's all coming back to me.

18:19.520 --> 18:20.950
He remembers.

18:20.950 --> 18:22.390
You've ruined everything.

18:22.390 --> 18:23.940
Harvey was never yours.

18:23.940 --> 18:25.560
You're going down Spellman.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.560
And I'm taking you with me.

18:31.870 --> 18:33.270
Freak!

18:33.270 --> 18:34.240
Tramp!

18:34.240 --> 18:35.330
Super-freak!

18:35.330 --> 18:36.420
Super-tramp!

18:36.420 --> 18:38.720
Go with the jab, stay inside,

18:40.360 --> 18:42.730
Tough left, let's get in there.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.660
Okay, break it up.

18:45.660 --> 18:46.430
Whore!

18:46.430 --> 18:47.090
Loser!

18:47.090 --> 18:48.070
And enough.

18:48.070 --> 18:50.070
Why'd you pull me off? I had her!

18:50.070 --> 18:51.600
Why are you fighting with Libby

18:51.600 --> 18:53.640
when there's a guy over there who's just remembered

18:53.640 --> 18:54.470
he's crazy about you?

18:54.470 --> 18:55.320
Good point.

19:01.070 --> 19:02.140
I missed you.

19:02.140 --> 19:03.810
I missed you too.

19:05.300 --> 19:07.540
But she attacked me!

19:07.540 --> 19:09.750
She did not,

19:09.750 --> 19:12.890
and for conduct unbecomeing of a Drake girl

19:12.890 --> 19:16.250
I hereby excommunicate you from the teen-board.

19:16.250 --> 19:17.390
What!

19:17.390 --> 19:20.300
This is the worst night of my life.

19:23.320 --> 19:25.620
Now what was it you were going to say to me.

19:27.980 --> 19:31.030
I would be honoured if you would agree to be my...

19:31.030 --> 19:31.840
Help!

19:31.840 --> 19:33.350
Is there a nurse in the house?

19:33.350 --> 19:34.740
I'm a nurse, what's wrong?

19:34.740 --> 19:37.270
The janitors just been attacked by a swarm of wasps.

19:37.270 --> 19:39.870
Code blue, and get me a cold compress.

19:40.620 --> 19:42.660
I'll wait for you Nancy.

19:42.660 --> 19:43.820
Excuse me,

19:44.250 --> 19:45.810
I don't mean to be rude but...

19:45.810 --> 19:48.000
have you ever been to the Grand Canyon?

19:48.000 --> 19:49.540
Only as a child.

19:49.540 --> 19:50.880
Beverly?

19:51.480 --> 19:52.560
Kenneth?

19:53.970 --> 19:56.610
My long lost sister.

19:59.120 --> 20:01.520
I can't believe I ever forgot you.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.230
I don't blame you,

20:04.230 --> 20:05.590
I blame the ladder.

20:15.360 --> 20:18.580
Tomorrow I just want everything back to normal. I'm off excitement for a while.

20:18.690 --> 20:19.810
Good idea.

20:19.810 --> 20:21.910
But there's still one thing I'm curious about,

20:22.100 --> 20:24.320
I wonder if Mr. Pool ended up with nurse Nancy?

20:24.320 --> 20:26.920
Oh I'm sure, what could possibly go wrong?

20:33.280 --> 20:35.880
You're back. You look tired.

20:35.880 --> 20:37.810
I could use a cold compress.

20:37.810 --> 20:39.380
Now what was it you wanted to say?

20:39.380 --> 20:41.170
Oh Nancy, hear me out.

20:41.170 --> 20:43.770
I would be honoured if you would be my wife?

20:43.770 --> 20:45.290
Oh Gene,

20:45.440 --> 20:47.600
if only you'd asked me an hour ago.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.200
How can I put this?

20:49.200 --> 20:50.320
I've met someone.

20:50.320 --> 20:51.230
Who!

20:51.230 --> 20:52.690
It's better that you don't know.

20:52.690 --> 20:54.190
I'm going away Gene.

20:54.190 --> 20:55.970
I only hope that you can forgive me.

20:57.320 --> 20:58.730
But wait!

20:59.490 --> 21:00.730
You can't!

21:03.290 --> 21:05.760
Ah well, I got a lot further than I thought I would.

21:11.390 --> 21:13.110
How did he take it?

21:13.110 --> 21:14.760
He'll be fine.

21:14.760 --> 21:16.650
Gene's strong and has both eyes.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.450
You need me more.

21:18.450 --> 21:21.110
It was worth being stung hundreds of times,

21:21.110 --> 21:23.110
it's what brought us together.

21:31.660 --> 21:34.900
Up. Up. Down. Whoa!

21:35.370 --> 21:37.740
Whoa. Loop-de-loop!, whoo.

21:37.740 --> 21:39.030
That was crazy.

21:39.030 --> 21:42.090
I'm glad you decided to give lint spotting another chance Sabrina.

21:42.090 --> 21:42.920
Me too.

21:42.920 --> 21:44.740
For the first hour it was kinda boring

21:44.740 --> 21:47.560
but now I'm captivated by the subtlety, the nuance,

21:47.560 --> 21:49.670
the constant struggle to stay aloft.

21:50.350 --> 21:53.390
I mean I now understand, it's a metaphor for life.

21:54.300 --> 21:55.390
Yeah?

21:55.390 --> 21:57.530
You need to get out more.
