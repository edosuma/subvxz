00:37.955 --> 00:39.540
Good morning.

00:45.672 --> 00:47.215
Andy Sipowicz.

00:47.382 --> 00:49.634
Oh, Andy. Bobby Simone.
Good to meet you.

00:49.801 --> 00:51.220
Yeah.

01:20.002 --> 01:23.213
Good morning, Donna.
Good morning, lieutenant.

01:26.049 --> 01:27.635
Hey, lieu.

01:27.886 --> 01:29.470
Lieutenant.

01:29.637 --> 01:31.806
Morning, Andy.
- It's not gonna work out.

01:31.973 --> 01:34.309
What isn't?
- I just met this new guy.

01:34.517 --> 01:37.021
- Simone?
- Yeah, it's not gonna work out.

01:37.188 --> 01:39.315
- What happened?
- Oh, don't get me started.

01:39.440 --> 01:44.613
I mean, his attitude's all wrong.
"How you doing?" This type of thing.

01:44.779 --> 01:46.990
- He asked you how you were doing?
- Yeah.

01:50.952 --> 01:51.995
Yeah. Fancy.

01:53.331 --> 01:55.791
Uh-huh. Yeah, where?

01:56.834 --> 01:58.211
All right.

01:58.669 --> 02:00.213
We got a homicide.

02:00.379 --> 02:02.674
Look, Andy, you're senior in the squad.

02:02.883 --> 02:04.968
I want him with you
until he learns the precinct.

02:07.846 --> 02:10.725
I need glasses and everything else.

02:18.024 --> 02:20.069
Yeah, I'm here to see Adrienne Lesniak.

02:20.236 --> 02:21.946
And your name is?

02:32.040 --> 02:33.208
Hey.

02:34.543 --> 02:36.586
Jimmy.
- What?

02:37.087 --> 02:39.840
- It's not like you give me a choice.
- Not here, please.

02:40.007 --> 02:40.967
Oh, then where?

02:41.133 --> 02:43.886
I can't talk to you because
I don't know where you're staying.

02:44.428 --> 02:47.432
I can't call you because you tell
that bitch not to put me through.

02:47.599 --> 02:51.395
- Where am I supposed to talk to you?
We have nothing to talk about.

02:51.562 --> 02:53.438
What are you looking at?

02:54.523 --> 02:57.277
If you need anything...
Thanks a lot.

02:57.443 --> 03:00.446
You don't know how much
I love you, Adie.

03:00.613 --> 03:02.198
You don't know what I'd do for you.

03:02.365 --> 03:04.243
- You're drunk.
- Sit down!

03:04.410 --> 03:07.913
- Get up and get the hell away from her!
No.

03:08.247 --> 03:10.207
You back off.

03:10.374 --> 03:13.670
I'm holding a.38
and it's pointed straight at her guts.

03:13.837 --> 03:15.797
- Jimmy.
- You want to keep this private?

03:15.964 --> 03:18.133
Come on, I'll give you private.

03:18.717 --> 03:20.343
Let's go.

03:33.108 --> 03:35.027
Hey! Hey!

03:38.405 --> 03:40.116
Ah!

03:47.582 --> 03:49.418
He's from the 2-7, lieu. He's on the job.

03:49.585 --> 03:53.047
He's under arrest.
Donna, get a DA down here.

03:53.339 --> 03:54.632
Take him to 1.

03:54.924 --> 03:57.427
Are you happy?
Look what you did to me now, Adie!

03:57.594 --> 03:58.720
Shut up!

03:58.887 --> 04:00.764
Is this what you wanted?
- Simone?

04:01.014 --> 04:04.684
- How you doing there, lieutenant?
- Okay, I got this. Get to your homicide.

04:04.893 --> 04:06.771
Thirteenth and Third.

04:06.938 --> 04:08.981
- You hurt?
- I'll live.

04:09.148 --> 04:10.650
Come on, ride with me.

05:09.299 --> 05:11.009
Simone Says

05:20.019 --> 05:23.272
They were going out?
Yeah, they were in the 27.

05:23.439 --> 05:26.151
She broke up with him, got transferred.
He went half-wacky.

05:26.318 --> 05:29.237
He made the whole trip.
Here.

05:29.404 --> 05:31.072
What was your last assignment?

05:32.365 --> 05:34.202
Intelligence.
I drove for the commissioner.

05:34.368 --> 05:36.329
One of those guys
that got grade promotions?

05:36.495 --> 05:38.623
- Yeah.
- That was nice.

05:52.388 --> 05:54.182
Where are we at?
- Over here.

05:54.349 --> 05:56.517
- Anybody check for ID?
- No, we waited for you guys.

05:56.684 --> 05:58.019
Start the canvass?

05:58.186 --> 06:02.149
Have one of the uniforms run the plates
on these parked cars. Thanks.

06:11.576 --> 06:13.620
Three in the chest. You see any more?

06:16.957 --> 06:19.877
Raymond Alphonse Martarano Jr.
Here's a Bensonhurst address.

06:20.044 --> 06:21.295
This the wise guy's son?

06:21.462 --> 06:24.173
Or someone too stupid
to change his name. Hey, Greg.

06:24.340 --> 06:28.971
Find out if the M.E.'s responding and let
Fancy know we got a mobbed-up stiff.

06:30.138 --> 06:31.265
Back it up.

06:31.473 --> 06:34.810
- We got a bullet shell over here.
- I got it.

06:35.227 --> 06:39.190
Come on, guys. Move everybody back,
away from the crime scene.

06:39.315 --> 06:42.151
- I need some cones here.
That man's the super there.

06:42.318 --> 06:43.903
The victim knew one of the tenants.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.281
Mr. Goldman, Det. Sipowicz.

06:45.447 --> 06:46.824
Hi.
- You knew this man?

06:46.991 --> 06:51.078
Mr. Big Shot? He'd tell the lamppost
who he was if nobody was around.

06:51.245 --> 06:53.915
- Who did he know in this building?
2- C, Ms. Anderson.

06:54.082 --> 06:56.501
Where do I find her?
- She's a model.

06:56.668 --> 06:58.420
I'm to call her agency for emergencies.

06:58.587 --> 07:02.091
I'll need that.
It's 246...

07:02.258 --> 07:04.886
Help me! Help me! Help me!
My mother's been shot!

07:05.052 --> 07:06.679
Where's your mother?

07:08.014 --> 07:08.437
Let us through.

07:08.472 --> 07:09.473
Let us through.

07:09.682 --> 07:12.644
In there.
I was in the grocery store.

07:29.580 --> 07:30.915
She's dead, isn't she?

07:31.999 --> 07:34.209
Yeah, I'm afraid she is.

07:35.002 --> 07:40.008
She was in her own apartment.
She was at her own window.

07:40.175 --> 07:42.427
Sit down. Sit down, okay?

07:43.720 --> 07:46.098
That's my mother.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.018
I'm sorry.

07:51.062 --> 07:52.647
Folks, the party's over.

07:52.813 --> 07:54.607
I think it was a stray from the street.

08:03.993 --> 08:09.123
- Hey. How are you feeling?
- Upset.

08:09.249 --> 08:12.920
Well, IAB just took him to Bellevue
under 72-hour evaluation.

08:13.087 --> 08:14.797
- He's a collar, right?
- Yeah.

08:14.964 --> 08:16.757
I've alerted the DA and Corrections...

08:16.924 --> 08:19.885
...so if he goes into the system,
we're going to be notified.

08:20.094 --> 08:22.681
You want to put in a 28, Adrienne?
Try it again tomorrow?

08:22.847 --> 08:24.349
No, I'd like to try today.

08:24.724 --> 08:27.352
Okay, but pay attention
to how you're feeling.

08:27.519 --> 08:30.439
Okay, thanks.

08:30.940 --> 08:33.109
Hey.
There was a second DOA.

08:33.275 --> 08:35.736
82-year-old woman
sitting at her window.

08:36.111 --> 08:38.364
World's coming up here
because it's Martarano's son.

08:38.530 --> 08:41.577
- Organized Crime, Intelligence.
- Oh, now I know the case will clear.

08:41.994 --> 08:44.621
- Anything off canvass?
- No witnesses.

08:44.788 --> 08:47.583
He was banging some model
who lived at the building.

08:47.749 --> 08:49.752
Simone's finding out
where we can pick her up.

08:49.919 --> 08:51.504
How's that going?

08:52.255 --> 08:55.300
- Know he drove for the commissioner?
- I saw that was his last detail.

08:55.466 --> 08:57.595
Takes me 22 years
to make second-grade.

08:57.761 --> 09:00.180
This guy gets there
shooing away squeegee bums.

09:00.347 --> 09:04.435
Yeah, yeah, no. I can't.
Just hold on for a second, will you?

09:04.602 --> 09:07.397
Andy, the modeling agency told me
where she was working.

09:07.772 --> 09:11.359
- Give me half a minute?
Yeah. Hey.

09:12.110 --> 09:14.405
- What's going on?
- Just seeing to Abruzzo.

09:14.572 --> 09:16.657
I understand
what you wanna do, but I-

09:16.824 --> 09:18.284
Is that the new detective?

09:18.743 --> 09:22.038
Yeah, Simone.
What kind of name is that?

09:22.246 --> 09:26.376
First or last?
- If it was his first name, he'd be a girl.

09:26.543 --> 09:29.296
Last name Simone, it sounds French.

09:29.463 --> 09:33.176
Listen to me. I went through a whole
lot of trouble getting that red cock.

09:34.385 --> 09:36.137
I'm not gonna sit here
and argue with you.

09:36.304 --> 09:40.516
Tell Billy he can't come around my place
anymore with that blue-barred cock.

09:40.683 --> 09:43.729
I'm serious. Yeah, okay, thanks.

09:53.573 --> 09:55.659
- I breed birds.
Oh.

09:57.077 --> 09:59.288
Racing pigeons.

09:59.872 --> 10:01.832
- Tell him you keep fish.
Uh-uh.

10:02.083 --> 10:05.378
Assistant DA Costas,
this is Detective Simone.

10:05.544 --> 10:07.004
- How you doing?
- How do you do?

10:07.171 --> 10:10.384
They give you that address?
She's on Seventh Avenue.

10:11.718 --> 10:14.346
Must be very interesting raising pigeons.

10:14.513 --> 10:16.140
Yeah, it's a lot of fun.

10:17.183 --> 10:20.812
- You know, it gets you outdoors.
- You guys and your hobbies.

10:23.189 --> 10:24.857
All right, let's go.

10:35.787 --> 10:40.000
Okay, once again, nice and soft.
Not to camera. Don't pose.

10:40.166 --> 10:43.045
Real relaxed, real pretty.

10:44.046 --> 10:46.173
This isn't gonna help.

10:46.382 --> 10:48.551
Excuse me, can I help you?

10:49.010 --> 10:51.930
Yeah. Any of these people
Paula Anderson?

10:52.097 --> 10:53.056
Yes.

10:54.224 --> 10:57.853
- Well, you want me to guess?
- How long will this tie her up?

10:58.020 --> 11:00.105
We won't know how long
until we talk to her.

11:00.607 --> 11:03.109
And it couldn't wait
until after she finishes work?

11:03.276 --> 11:05.069
No.

11:05.695 --> 11:07.655
- I'll get her.
- Thank you very much.

11:07.864 --> 11:10.367
Do you want us to wait
over there maybe?

11:10.534 --> 11:12.161
Thank you.

11:13.329 --> 11:15.331
How's it going, pal?

11:15.623 --> 11:17.625
Paula, police want to talk to you.

11:17.917 --> 11:20.295
- What a country, huh?
Yeah.

11:25.300 --> 11:26.802
We have to take a break.

11:26.969 --> 11:29.096
Okay, we're gonna relax a minute.

11:31.015 --> 11:33.941
Hand me my sweater?
Sure.

11:33.976 --> 11:34.936
Hand me my sweater?
Sure.

11:35.102 --> 11:36.897
- Yeah?
- You Paula Anderson?

11:37.064 --> 11:40.651
Yeah.
- I'm Det. Sipowicz, this is Det. Simone.

11:40.817 --> 11:41.944
What's going on?

11:42.653 --> 11:45.657
Do you know a Raymond Martarano Jr.?

11:45.823 --> 11:47.909
- Yeah.
- When was the last time you saw him?

11:48.785 --> 11:51.454
We partied last night,
then I had to come to work.

11:52.080 --> 11:54.333
You left him at your apartment?

11:54.500 --> 11:56.210
What's going on?

11:56.377 --> 11:58.128
He was murdered outside your building.

11:58.545 --> 12:02.133
Your downstairs neighbor
was killed by a stray bullet.

12:03.426 --> 12:05.136
Which downstairs neighbor?

12:05.971 --> 12:07.264
Mrs. Savino.

12:11.310 --> 12:13.521
I don't know anything about it.

12:13.688 --> 12:17.650
Come down to the station with us,
and let's get the background on this.

12:17.817 --> 12:19.568
- I'm working.
- Now you're not working.

12:19.736 --> 12:22.531
Now you're coming down
to the station house with us.

12:24.366 --> 12:26.952
Why don't you just get dressed,
Paula, okay?

12:27.452 --> 12:28.997
Okay.

12:50.061 --> 12:52.564
- Mrs. Davis?
- Yes.

12:53.023 --> 12:56.152
I'm Adrienne Lesniak.
You asked to speak with a detective?

12:56.277 --> 12:59.030
Yes.

12:59.780 --> 13:02.158
But is there a male detective
I could speak with?

13:02.325 --> 13:05.120
I'm the detective available
right now, Mrs. Davis.

13:05.287 --> 13:07.831
Why don't you tell me why you're here.

13:07.998 --> 13:11.627
Well, I can't be here too long.
I work.

13:11.793 --> 13:15.882
Why do you feel you need to speak
with a detective, Mrs. Davis?

13:16.299 --> 13:17.842
Well...

13:18.009 --> 13:19.844
...I just wondered if someone...

13:20.011 --> 13:24.516
...like a police detective...

13:25.392 --> 13:27.102
...could talk to my husband.

13:27.269 --> 13:29.188
About what?

13:30.230 --> 13:32.025
Um....

13:33.026 --> 13:38.657
Well, we have a daughter who's 14.

13:40.242 --> 13:41.202
And?

13:43.704 --> 13:47.291
Well, since she was very young...

13:47.875 --> 13:51.672
...Arthur would help her
say her prayers.

13:52.547 --> 13:56.468
And he would be in her room...

13:56.635 --> 13:59.347
...sometimes 20 minutes.

14:01.224 --> 14:03.393
And, um....

14:04.269 --> 14:07.064
And about three years ago...

14:07.481 --> 14:10.734
...he started closing the door...

14:11.694 --> 14:14.113
...and staying in there.

14:15.407 --> 14:16.825
Staying for how long?

14:17.575 --> 14:20.453
He doesn't come to our bed anymore.

14:20.620 --> 14:23.791
He doesn't sleep with me,
he sleeps with her.

14:25.167 --> 14:28.796
Now, I don't know
what goes on in there.

14:29.797 --> 14:32.134
Well, have you asked him about it?

14:32.301 --> 14:36.305
I can't do that. I-
That would sound like an accusation.

14:36.471 --> 14:38.974
Well, what about your daughter?
What does she say?

14:39.141 --> 14:40.892
I haven't mentioned it to her.

14:41.394 --> 14:42.645
Well, why not?

14:43.062 --> 14:45.440
Well, she's still a child.

14:45.815 --> 14:49.820
Mrs. Davis, are you saying your husband
is molesting your daughter?

14:50.654 --> 14:54.325
No, no. I haven't said that.

14:55.117 --> 14:57.244
I can't say that for certain.

14:57.369 --> 15:01.166
Well, we can't investigate unless you
or your daughter alleges a crime.

15:01.333 --> 15:04.377
Couldn't you get someone
to just go talk to him?

15:08.633 --> 15:09.967
Mrs. Davis...

15:11.052 --> 15:13.763
...I think you need to bring
your daughter in.

15:19.144 --> 15:21.355
I, uh...

15:21.730 --> 15:23.899
I left home around 6 a. m.

15:24.066 --> 15:27.236
I didn't wake up Raymond.
He liked to sleep late.

15:27.403 --> 15:29.447
Did he talk about meeting anybody
this morning?

15:29.781 --> 15:30.782
No.

15:30.949 --> 15:34.411
- You know any of his friends?
- I don't know that I'd call them friends.

15:34.536 --> 15:37.539
I mean, I knew a couple
of his business partners but....

15:37.706 --> 15:40.709
- No. Friends? Not lately.
- Why's that?

15:41.335 --> 15:42.670
I don't know.

15:42.837 --> 15:47.008
Raymond didn't talk much about it. I just
knew that they weren't getting along.

15:47.217 --> 15:48.843
So who were the partners?

15:49.010 --> 15:52.765
Well, the only one that I actually knew
was Jerry Littman.

15:52.932 --> 15:56.894
He was a jobber.
Heather's Heavenly Bridal Wear.

15:57.061 --> 15:59.021
I did their fall show.

15:59.188 --> 16:02.359
That's how I met Raymond.
He was hitting on all the models.

16:02.609 --> 16:03.902
Yeah?

16:05.988 --> 16:08.657
Can you think of anyone else
Raymond didn't get along with?

16:08.824 --> 16:13.454
I don't know. You know,
I wasn't seeing him for that long.

16:13.579 --> 16:15.790
I mean, I never even met his family.

16:15.957 --> 16:19.878
But, I mean, you know who they are.

16:20.045 --> 16:21.255
Who?

16:21.380 --> 16:23.403
- His father's totally mobbed up.
- How do you know that?

16:23.438 --> 16:25.426
- His father's totally mobbed up.
- How do you know that?

16:25.592 --> 16:28.263
Raymond bragged about it.
- So that didn't bother you?

16:28.430 --> 16:31.433
No. Why would it bother me?

16:31.599 --> 16:34.477
You know how those wise guys are.
They like to spend their money.

16:34.644 --> 16:37.189
We'd go to the clubs
and we were treated like royalty.

16:37.356 --> 16:38.941
Before we even got to the table...

16:39.108 --> 16:42.653
...Raymond would knock off, like,
$50 and think nothing of it.

16:46.366 --> 16:49.369
- He ever say he was afraid of anybody?
- No.

16:50.037 --> 16:53.625
Raymond would never admit to me
that he was afraid of anybody.

16:53.791 --> 16:56.044
That just wasn't like him.

16:57.211 --> 17:00.590
Aside from Raymond,
you seeing anybody else, Paula?

17:01.591 --> 17:05.137
I work a 12-hour day.
I come home and I collapse.

17:06.305 --> 17:08.891
- I'm a little wiped-out. Can I go home?
- No.

17:09.391 --> 17:11.394
Just sit here and relax a while, okay?

17:12.186 --> 17:16.398
Can we get you something? Like some
coffee, or a Coke, something like that?

17:16.566 --> 17:18.609
Yeah. Yeah, a diet Coke.

17:19.778 --> 17:23.741
And can I have something to eat?
A yogurt, salad?

17:24.575 --> 17:27.411
Yeah. There's a store
around the corner here, right?

17:27.578 --> 17:29.456
I'll take a walk.
I'll get you a yogurt.

17:32.626 --> 17:34.419
You think there's a second boyfriend?

17:34.628 --> 17:37.005
Maybe she'll tell us after she eats.

17:37.172 --> 17:39.300
What does that mean?
I'm moving too slow for you?

17:39.509 --> 17:42.178
I don't cater for them
until after they give something up.

17:42.345 --> 17:43.888
Everybody's got their own approach.

17:44.055 --> 17:46.265
Raymond Martarano's lawyer
is at the catching bench.

17:46.433 --> 17:50.062
One of you guys talk to him.
I've got Organized Crime in my office.

17:50.270 --> 17:54.191
Look, Andy, you worked a long time
with your last partner.

17:54.608 --> 17:57.988
Me and you, we're not always
gonna start on the same page.

17:58.113 --> 18:01.241
Yeah, I'd have scared her more
about the goombahs.

18:01.408 --> 18:04.537
It's better to cooperate with us
than to take a beating from them.

18:04.704 --> 18:06.747
But like you say,
everybody works their own way.

18:07.164 --> 18:08.958
If there was another boyfriend...

18:09.125 --> 18:11.377
...maybe she wouldn't want him
to take the beating.

18:11.544 --> 18:13.588
That's a way to go.

18:14.756 --> 18:17.759
- I hope you're not the sensitive type.
- Sensitive? Not usually.

18:17.926 --> 18:20.929
So you take this lawyer,
I'll go get the yogurt, huh?

18:24.309 --> 18:25.268
I'm Det. Sipowicz.

18:25.435 --> 18:28.980
Phillip Fox representing Raymond
Martarano. Somewhere we could talk?

18:29.147 --> 18:31.066
How about right here?

18:31.233 --> 18:33.777
All right, detective,
let's not make this adversarial.

18:33.986 --> 18:36.822
I'm simply asking the police
to provide some basic facts...

18:36.989 --> 18:40.285
...so that Mr. Martarano
can begin to understand this tragedy.

18:40.452 --> 18:43.038
Any chance I could speak
directly with Mr. Martarano...

18:43.204 --> 18:44.748
...and get some basic facts back?

18:45.081 --> 18:47.626
He's grief-stricken.
He's in no condition to talk to you.

18:47.792 --> 18:53.090
Go tell Mr. Martarano Raymond Jr.
was shot leaving an apartment building.

18:53.257 --> 18:56.469
One of the bullets ricocheted
and killed an 82-year-old woman.

18:56.719 --> 18:59.931
You tell him that we're at the preliminary
stage in our investigation.

19:00.098 --> 19:02.309
Any developments, we'll let him know.

19:02.476 --> 19:06.648
Det. Sipowicz, whatever your prejudices
may be about Raymond Martarano...

19:06.814 --> 19:09.734
...this is a father who just lost
his eldest son.

19:09.901 --> 19:12.320
Hey, lawyer Fox, you want me
to give up some names...

19:12.487 --> 19:16.325
...so your client can kick ass
and kill another innocent bystander?

19:16.492 --> 19:19.244
You tell Mr. Martarano
I am sorry for his loss...

19:19.411 --> 19:22.414
...and he will get the cooperation
that he gives.

19:22.581 --> 19:26.586
- I'll report our conversation.
- And I'll go back to work.

19:44.147 --> 19:45.482
- Ms. Savino?
- Yes.

19:45.691 --> 19:46.900
I'm Det. Simone.

19:47.067 --> 19:49.069
Oh, yes, you were there this morning.

19:49.236 --> 19:53.574
I came to see how things were going,
and maybe provide some information.

19:54.575 --> 19:57.954
Why don't we sit over here?
What sort of information?

19:58.162 --> 20:01.333
After you left, I remembered some facts
that might help on the case.

20:01.750 --> 20:05.421
I remembered something
my mother told me the day before.

20:05.587 --> 20:09.092
That she'd seen a black pickup truck
not normally parked on the block...

20:09.259 --> 20:12.387
...that was there two times
or more last week.

20:12.554 --> 20:15.682
- Uh-huh.
- Well, you see what I mean?

20:15.807 --> 20:19.312
She might have seen something
pertaining to this truck...

20:19.478 --> 20:23.232
...and with the people involved,
maybe they're the ones who did it.

20:23.399 --> 20:26.445
This morning, when I went out, it was
there. A black pickup truck...

20:26.570 --> 20:28.405
...with tinted windows.

20:28.530 --> 20:30.282
You know, so people can't see in.

20:30.449 --> 20:33.201
Right. Black pickup,
tinted glass, front and rear?

20:33.368 --> 20:35.997
Just rear. I wrote down the license.

20:37.749 --> 20:40.626
I got to tell you, it's highly
unlikely there's a connection...

20:40.793 --> 20:42.462
...but we'll check it out.

20:42.629 --> 20:44.757
Should I photograph the truck,
do you think?

20:44.923 --> 20:46.675
I think we have all we need on that.

20:51.513 --> 20:55.518
The more you love someone, the harder
it is to understand when they're taken.

20:55.685 --> 20:59.731
I know there's a chance
it was an accident, just an accident.

20:59.898 --> 21:01.817
I tell myself that.

21:02.526 --> 21:04.904
But then I think, well...

21:05.780 --> 21:07.865
...how many people's mothers
get shot by accident?

21:07.900 --> 21:09.951
...how many people's mothers
get shot by accident?

21:10.827 --> 21:14.122
- It doesn't make any sense.
- No, it doesn't.

21:15.624 --> 21:18.211
- I'm sorry if I wasted your time.
- No, not at all.

21:18.378 --> 21:20.713
- You got my card.
- You mean I should've called you?

21:20.880 --> 21:24.258
No, I'm just reminding you
that you've got it.

21:24.425 --> 21:26.761
Call me. Get in touch with me
whenever you want.

21:26.928 --> 21:29.014
All right, thank you.

21:41.987 --> 21:45.408
Detective, in all the hubbub,
we didn't get to say hello.

21:45.574 --> 21:46.951
- Bobby Simone.
- Donna Abandando.

21:47.118 --> 21:48.661
Pleased to meet you.

21:48.828 --> 21:50.746
That was the last time you saw him?

21:51.038 --> 21:52.456
Yeah, thanks.

21:53.165 --> 21:57.087
So Jerry Littman with two T's
says Ray Jr. was a deadbeat.

21:57.254 --> 22:00.257
He stiffed him on dough they were
going into business with...

22:00.424 --> 22:03.177
...but Ray had such a bright personality,
such a happy time...

22:03.302 --> 22:06.681
...with the bims and the recreational
stimulants that Jerry couldn't stay mad.

22:06.848 --> 22:09.434
- What did he say about Paula?
She modeled for him.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.729
She's from Elizabeth, New Jersey.

22:11.937 --> 22:15.816
And before Raymond, she was
seeing some guy that hauls bricks.

22:15.983 --> 22:20.113
He came into Littman's show room with
cement on his shoes. Come on, let's go.

22:21.781 --> 22:23.658
- He tell you this guy's name?
- Uh-uh.

22:23.783 --> 22:26.536
But he says Paula and him
were a pretty heavy item.

22:27.454 --> 22:29.040
Listen...

22:30.166 --> 22:32.668
...it's a good thing
you left room for the boyfriend.

22:37.089 --> 22:38.550
How are we doing, Paula?

22:38.717 --> 22:40.719
Oh, great. Thanks.
Yeah, it's real great.

22:41.219 --> 22:42.220
- Got your yogurt.
- When can I go?

22:42.255 --> 22:43.221
- Got your yogurt.
- When can I go?

22:44.181 --> 22:45.432
Shouldn't be too long now.

22:45.724 --> 22:49.020
Look, if you have any questions,
just ask them.

22:49.187 --> 22:52.357
You know, I'm kind of going crazy
in here. What is the problem?

22:52.523 --> 22:55.319
My problem, Paula,
is that I just don't believe you.

22:56.153 --> 22:58.197
Well, I don't understand
what you're saying.

22:58.364 --> 23:00.783
You don't even believe
that I was seeing Raymond?

23:00.949 --> 23:02.868
No, I heard all that.

23:03.160 --> 23:06.539
I heard all about the clubs
and how you were treated like royalty.

23:06.706 --> 23:09.084
But then we hear
about Elizabeth, New Jersey.

23:09.250 --> 23:10.710
So?

23:10.877 --> 23:14.256
What's that supposed to mean?
Everyone comes from somewhere, right?

23:14.423 --> 23:16.842
- You go back every weekend?
- My family's over there.

23:17.009 --> 23:18.761
Just your family, huh?

23:18.928 --> 23:21.514
Hey, look, don't play with me,
all right?

23:21.681 --> 23:23.934
If we go back there
and ask questions about you...

23:24.101 --> 23:26.770
- ...we won't find out something?
- There's nothing to find.

23:26.979 --> 23:30.273
I sat over there for years
and I looked across this river...

23:30.440 --> 23:33.820
...and this is where I wanted to be,
and I wanted to be here with Raymond.

23:34.028 --> 23:37.115
So don't you go telling me
that I didn't care about him.

23:37.281 --> 23:39.367
Oh, I wish he was still alive.

23:39.868 --> 23:42.204
All right, Paula. Listen to me, all right?

23:42.371 --> 23:45.708
Whoever did this, we're not the only
people looking for him. Understand?

23:46.333 --> 23:48.628
- Raymond's family?
- Whoever did this...

23:48.795 --> 23:52.424
...he'd have a lot better chance in here
with us than he would on the street.

23:52.590 --> 23:54.801
Now, if it's somebody
that you cared about-

23:58.848 --> 24:01.142
It is somebody
that you cared about, right?

24:01.308 --> 24:04.979
I understand that. Maybe if it was me,
I'd be here doing the same thing.

24:05.146 --> 24:06.898
But I want you to think about something.

24:07.065 --> 24:10.527
I want you to think about the position
that this person is in.

24:10.694 --> 24:12.529
Somebody out there's gonna find him.

24:12.696 --> 24:14.239
And...

24:14.866 --> 24:16.326
- ...he'd go to jail?
- No.

24:16.492 --> 24:20.246
Nobody can say anything like that.
We don't know the circumstances.

24:20.413 --> 24:24.710
If Raymond had a gun and threatened
him, that could totally change things.

24:27.546 --> 24:29.673
Who's your boyfriend, Paula?

24:32.134 --> 24:33.803
Come on. Look, I know you love him.

24:33.970 --> 24:36.681
You're trying to protect him.
I respect that.

24:36.848 --> 24:38.975
But what you're doing here
is not gonna help him.

24:39.476 --> 24:41.645
It's gonna get him killed.

24:44.065 --> 24:47.068
It's not-
It's not his fault.

24:47.860 --> 24:51.657
It's my fault. It was because
of everything that I was doing.

24:56.453 --> 24:58.873
His name is Paddy Perkins.

24:59.707 --> 25:01.876
I can tell you where he works.

25:03.670 --> 25:05.254
Good.

25:17.894 --> 25:21.272
Hey. Hey.

25:23.525 --> 25:25.486
We're looking for Paddy Perkins.

25:25.653 --> 25:29.115
He's an oiler. He's over there.
You need a hardhat to go over there.

25:29.281 --> 25:30.491
Yeah, okay.

25:30.866 --> 25:32.952
- Hey, you Paddy?
No.

25:38.625 --> 25:39.960
Hey, Paddy around?

25:40.127 --> 25:43.589
- Yeah, that's me.
You got a minute?

25:44.132 --> 25:46.134
You're gonna have to take
a ride with us.

25:46.300 --> 25:48.177
What's?
- Your name was mentioned...

25:48.344 --> 25:49.679
...in an investigation.

25:49.846 --> 25:53.559
Come to the station house with us
and we'll straighten it out. Come on.

25:53.726 --> 25:54.893
Everything all right?

25:55.060 --> 25:57.354
These guys are cops.
They want me to go with them.

25:57.521 --> 25:59.815
- What do you want to do?
- Why, you writing a book?

26:00.065 --> 26:02.819
- It's all right. I'll go.
I know the law.

26:02.986 --> 26:04.863
They got no warrant,
you don't have to go.

26:05.030 --> 26:09.075
Hey, Paddy's cooperating here. You stay
out of this. Nobody asked you anything.

26:09.242 --> 26:11.454
I work with the guy.
I'm telling him his rights.

26:11.787 --> 26:15.082
Yeah? What about your rights
to getting your ass kicked...

26:15.207 --> 26:18.337
...getting collared and winding up
in night court? Want those?

26:18.879 --> 26:21.089
- Let's go.
- It's all right.

26:22.049 --> 26:23.008
I didn't think so.

26:24.092 --> 26:25.761
Come on.

26:31.059 --> 26:35.480
Allison, your mother told us that there
are some things going on in your home.

26:35.646 --> 26:39.401
I don't know why she came here.
I don't know why she brought me here.

26:39.610 --> 26:43.405
She told us your father's been sleeping
with you in your bedroom.

26:43.572 --> 26:46.743
Is your father having relations
with you, Allison?

26:46.910 --> 26:48.995
Don't I have the right
to talk to an attorney?

26:49.162 --> 26:51.081
No one's accusing you of anything.

26:51.247 --> 26:53.667
If anyone did anything wrong,
it would be your father.

26:53.834 --> 26:55.211
My mother lies.

26:55.378 --> 26:57.380
Why would she lie
about something like that?

26:57.546 --> 26:58.964
I don't know, but it's not true.

26:59.131 --> 27:01.759
Your father isn't having relations
with you?

27:01.926 --> 27:03.261
No.

27:03.428 --> 27:06.264
Why don't I bring your mother in here?

27:07.140 --> 27:08.392
Allison...

27:08.934 --> 27:11.771
...why don't I bring
your mother in here?

27:13.898 --> 27:15.358
Okay.

27:23.117 --> 27:26.078
Could you come in
for a second, Mrs. Davis?

27:32.293 --> 27:33.962
Sit down.

27:42.555 --> 27:46.058
Allison said her father
hasn't been intimate with her.

27:46.893 --> 27:50.605
- How can you do this?
- I have to do this. It can't go on.

27:50.772 --> 27:53.066
You know what they'll do.
They'll take me away.

27:53.233 --> 27:54.818
Allison, that isn't true.

27:58.364 --> 28:01.826
It can't go on, Allison.
I can't live with it anymore.

28:02.410 --> 28:04.663
You can't make me say anything.

28:04.830 --> 28:07.249
You can put me in jail,
but I'll never say anything.

28:07.416 --> 28:10.502
Honey, please.
I'm only trying to help you.

28:10.878 --> 28:12.296
No.

28:12.463 --> 28:14.007
No.

28:14.174 --> 28:16.259
I'm not afraid. I'll go to jail.

28:16.426 --> 28:18.678
No one is going to put you in jail...

28:19.137 --> 28:21.806
...but you can't hide from this
any longer.

28:21.974 --> 28:26.520
We have to do something about this.
Don't you want it to stop?

28:31.693 --> 28:34.154
Tell me what he did to you.

28:35.655 --> 28:37.699
He touched me.

28:39.076 --> 28:41.537
- And he showed me how to touch him.
- Oh, God.

28:47.418 --> 28:49.421
What could I do?

28:50.005 --> 28:52.091
He's my father.

28:55.302 --> 28:56.720
When did it start?

28:57.179 --> 29:00.308
I don't know exactly.
It was before I got my periods.

29:00.725 --> 29:04.562
When he began sleeping with you,
what did he do?

29:06.857 --> 29:09.068
He does everything.

29:10.778 --> 29:12.988
You know, everything.

29:20.789 --> 29:22.457
Here, sit down.

29:22.624 --> 29:25.378
- So am I under arrest?
No, you're not under arrest.

29:25.545 --> 29:28.089
So, what's going to get me
back to the job?

29:28.256 --> 29:30.800
What's this about?
I'm losing a day's pay here.

29:30.967 --> 29:34.388
Paddy, where were you
between 6:30 and 8 this morning?

29:34.555 --> 29:37.141
That's easy. I was sitting
in traffic in the tunnel.

29:37.599 --> 29:40.269
- Did you drive in with anybody?
- No.

29:40.394 --> 29:41.938
You can check with Tommy Doyle.

29:42.105 --> 29:44.482
He's an oiler on the same crew.
He was late too.

29:44.649 --> 29:48.111
All right, maybe we'll talk to him.

29:48.528 --> 29:50.906
Paddy, we've been talking to Paula.

29:51.282 --> 29:53.534
- Paula Anderson?
Yeah.

29:53.701 --> 29:54.994
Is she in trouble?

29:55.703 --> 29:59.666
A guy named Raymond Martarano
was shot in front of her place.

29:59.875 --> 30:02.002
- But she's okay?
- Yeah, she's okay.

30:02.169 --> 30:05.338
She ever talk to you about this guy,
Raymond Martarano?

30:05.505 --> 30:09.427
No. I don't see too much of her anymore
since she moved away from Elizabeth.

30:10.219 --> 30:13.598
She gave us the impression that the two
of you were pretty close at one time.

30:13.765 --> 30:16.727
Yeah? Well, we were.

30:16.894 --> 30:20.105
Did you know she was going out
with Raymond for the last three months?

30:20.397 --> 30:22.524
No, I didn't know that.

30:22.941 --> 30:26.279
I don't know too much about what she
does since she moved to the city.

30:26.488 --> 30:32.118
Yeah. This Martarano's a mob guy.
A real scumbag.

30:32.285 --> 30:33.787
I guess they caught up with him.

30:33.953 --> 30:38.042
An elderly woman lives in one of the
apartments, was sitting at her window...

30:38.209 --> 30:41.128
...she got hit by a stray bullet.

30:41.837 --> 30:43.924
- She gonna be all right?
- She's dead.

30:44.091 --> 30:46.218
I'm sure no one meant
to kill that woman.

30:46.385 --> 30:49.054
But until we find out
why the guy was killed...

30:49.221 --> 30:52.058
...we got to treat that one
as an intentional murder also.

30:52.225 --> 30:54.352
But we know it wasn't.

30:55.561 --> 30:58.106
Yeah, well, I didn't shoot anybody.

30:58.898 --> 31:02.528
All right, Paddy, we got
to check out a few things.

31:02.695 --> 31:07.032
Why don't you take the time,
think if there's any way you can help us.

31:07.574 --> 31:08.909
Huh?

31:21.674 --> 31:24.009
I'm sure someone transposed
license plate numbers.

31:24.176 --> 31:27.054
I've never had an auto accident,
and I've never been in Albany.

31:27.221 --> 31:29.015
There may be some clerical mix-up.

31:29.182 --> 31:31.643
I don't know why we couldn't have
done this by phone.

31:31.810 --> 31:35.063
Well, they need a personal
interview for the files.

31:35.439 --> 31:37.233
Step right in.

31:49.204 --> 31:51.790
To tell you the truth, Mr. Davis...

31:51.957 --> 31:55.211
...we're not going to be talking
about any auto accident in Albany.

31:55.378 --> 31:56.713
What do you mean?

31:56.880 --> 32:00.842
- You know what we'll be talking about.
- I have absolutely no idea.

32:00.967 --> 32:03.345
You saying you brought me here
under false pretenses?

32:03.512 --> 32:04.513
Sit down.

32:09.393 --> 32:12.439
One of our detectives...

32:12.606 --> 32:15.942
...has taken a complaint about you
from your wife and daughter.

32:16.693 --> 32:18.612
They've made some
disturbing statements.

32:19.196 --> 32:21.491
I'm dumbfounded by this.

32:21.991 --> 32:24.118
A lot of people have
very strong feelings...

32:24.285 --> 32:26.579
...about the things your daughter
says you've done.

32:26.746 --> 32:27.872
I wanna talk to Allison.

32:28.039 --> 32:32.669
They tend to focus on punishment,
which in your case, would be prison.

32:32.836 --> 32:35.005
- Prison?
- That's right.

32:35.964 --> 32:37.926
Now...

32:38.176 --> 32:41.679
...I'm a family man. I know how
important it is to keep families together.

32:41.846 --> 32:45.350
- Well, that's certainly true.
- Based on what your daughter has said...

32:45.517 --> 32:48.229
...I think your being forthcoming...

32:48.396 --> 32:52.233
...is the best chance at keeping
this situation under control.

32:53.442 --> 32:55.403
I don't know.

32:55.654 --> 32:57.322
Maybe I should speak to a lawyer.

32:58.532 --> 33:02.661
Yeah, well, you know,
that's the other way you could go.

33:02.828 --> 33:05.206
Then it goes to the DA,
it's out of my hands.

33:05.415 --> 33:07.917
What would be the alternative?

33:08.292 --> 33:10.712
Something like counseling?

33:11.129 --> 33:14.341
Well, I'd need your help
on something like that.

33:14.508 --> 33:17.010
You'd have to make a statement
of corroboration.

33:17.177 --> 33:19.638
An admission that I've done something?

33:19.847 --> 33:24.477
Yeah, it would have to conform to
what your wife and daughter have said.

33:24.644 --> 33:27.397
- What did they say?
- You know...

33:27.564 --> 33:30.233
...spending the nights
with your daughter...

33:30.400 --> 33:34.280
...physical touching,
and penetration, and so forth.

33:35.322 --> 33:37.908
Otherwise, you see, if it's in dispute...

33:38.075 --> 33:40.537
...it has to go to the DA.

33:40.787 --> 33:43.206
I love my daughter.

33:43.749 --> 33:46.084
I would never do anything
to hurt her.

33:46.251 --> 33:50.298
You think I might qualify
for counseling?

33:50.465 --> 33:53.259
In that regard, a statement
is absolutely your best shot.

33:59.933 --> 34:02.102
My family...

34:02.853 --> 34:05.355
...is everything to me.

34:13.447 --> 34:16.034
- I'll do it.
- All right.

34:21.498 --> 34:25.045
We're going to have
a formality here.

34:25.212 --> 34:29.716
I'll give you your Miranda rights,
and you're going to do a statement.

34:29.882 --> 34:32.386
- You have the right to an attorney-
- I know my rights.

34:32.552 --> 34:34.222
Let me just finish this.

34:34.389 --> 34:36.431
You have the right to remain silent.

34:57.956 --> 34:59.959
Paddy, I know you're a decent guy.

35:00.126 --> 35:04.171
You want to do the right thing and
help these people that lost their mother.

35:04.338 --> 35:06.674
You got to know
what they're going through.

35:07.007 --> 35:10.053
You ready to do the right thing, Paddy?

35:10.220 --> 35:13.849
Look, Paula and me, we've been
together since we were 11 years old.

35:14.224 --> 35:16.017
I love her.

35:17.270 --> 35:20.106
Guys used to make fun of me
because I love her so much.

35:20.481 --> 35:23.151
I got money saved. I was gonna
get us a place in Rahway.

35:23.317 --> 35:25.236
How'd you find out
she was seeing Raymond?

35:25.403 --> 35:27.656
Guy from over in Elizabeth.

35:27.865 --> 35:30.033
He's an electrician.
He was working 7th Avenue.

35:30.576 --> 35:33.036
He saw them. He told me about it.

35:33.203 --> 35:35.039
I didn't want to believe him.

35:35.206 --> 35:37.584
I had to see for myself.

35:38.710 --> 35:42.380
I got money saved. I was gonna buy us
a place with a nice yard in Rahway.

35:42.547 --> 35:47.178
So, what'd you do? You waited in front
of her place, and you saw him come out?

35:47.344 --> 35:49.972
Yeah, he came out. Yeah.

35:50.139 --> 35:51.182
Did he see you?

35:51.474 --> 35:53.351
- Did he threaten you or anything?
- No.

35:53.386 --> 35:55.228
- Did he threaten you or anything?
- No.

35:55.729 --> 35:57.647
It was just the way he walked,
that prick.

35:58.231 --> 36:01.319
Like he had just taken away my life
and he felt good about it.

36:01.819 --> 36:04.864
So he sees me,
I tell him I want to talk to him.

36:05.531 --> 36:07.909
He tells me to kiss his ass.

36:08.076 --> 36:11.872
So I tell him he should leave her alone
because he probably doesn't love her.

36:12.039 --> 36:13.707
Then he sees I got a gun.

36:13.916 --> 36:17.419
- Did you have the gun out?
- No, it was just in my belt.

36:17.586 --> 36:19.506
Then he goes for me
and raises up his hand.

36:19.756 --> 36:22.425
- So you guys struggled, huh?
Not really.

36:23.134 --> 36:27.222
He made, like, these little burping
noises every time the bullets hit him.

36:33.062 --> 36:35.481
I'm sorry about that lady.

36:39.277 --> 36:43.198
Take a little break, huh?
Then we'll go talk to the DA.

36:43.740 --> 36:45.159
Sure.

36:45.326 --> 36:46.619
In your statement...

36:47.620 --> 36:50.081
...if you remembered there was
a struggle for the gun...

36:50.248 --> 36:53.376
...if that should come back to you,
remember to say that.

36:53.543 --> 36:55.504
One thing.

36:56.255 --> 36:58.382
You think I could see Paula?

36:58.549 --> 37:01.135
I just want to tell her....

37:02.219 --> 37:04.556
- I wanna see her.
- We'll try to work something out.

37:17.653 --> 37:20.741
- I'll get the lieutenant's okay.
- Tried to help the guy...

37:20.907 --> 37:22.993
...he wants to hold hands
with his girlfriend.

37:26.246 --> 37:28.290
- Keep an eye on the guy.
Lieutenant?

37:28.457 --> 37:32.795
The kid in Interrogation 2,
he turned over. He did it.

37:33.504 --> 37:35.131
Is that satisfactory?

37:36.215 --> 37:37.592
Yeah.

37:38.510 --> 37:39.762
This will do the trick.

37:43.807 --> 37:45.392
Get up.

37:47.020 --> 37:50.482
Mr. Davis, I'm placing you under arrest.

37:50.648 --> 37:54.068
- This is just another formality?
- Yeah.

37:54.235 --> 37:56.238
This is the formality
that puts you in jail.

37:56.489 --> 37:59.909
What are you saying? You promised
I'd get off with counseling.

38:00.326 --> 38:03.829
Someone else will make that decision.
I'm putting you under arrest.

38:04.246 --> 38:05.582
You lied to me!

38:05.749 --> 38:08.293
You promised if I made a statement,
I wouldn't go to jail.

38:08.460 --> 38:12.464
I said a statement's your best shot.
The DA makes the decision.

38:13.090 --> 38:15.051
You want my opinion?

38:15.218 --> 38:19.013
I hope they put you away,
you sick son of a bitch!

38:21.432 --> 38:23.143
Will she have to make
another statement?

38:23.310 --> 38:26.230
No, that will be it for today.
The DA will be in touch with you.

38:27.356 --> 38:29.191
- You bastard!
- Miriam.

38:29.358 --> 38:31.152
Ignore him.
- Don't talk!

38:31.319 --> 38:33.238
- Remember what I said.
- Don't talk to her!

38:33.404 --> 38:35.698
He's going into the system.
Let's go inside.

38:35.865 --> 38:38.368
Remember what Daddy told you!

38:46.836 --> 38:48.630
Thanks.

38:53.093 --> 38:54.344
Hey, Paula.

39:02.603 --> 39:04.939
So here we are, huh?

39:05.106 --> 39:06.692
Yeah.

39:07.734 --> 39:11.071
From one minute to the next,
everything's just...

39:11.321 --> 39:12.781
...gone.

39:12.948 --> 39:14.992
I'm so sorry.

39:15.452 --> 39:18.329
I am so sorry for hurting you.

39:18.496 --> 39:21.833
Just don't hate me, okay?
Just try not to hate me.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.752
Hate you?

39:23.918 --> 39:26.589
I could never hate you.

39:26.756 --> 39:29.383
That's just something I could never do.

39:29.550 --> 39:31.552
You know that.

39:32.929 --> 39:34.973
Don't you know that?

39:36.558 --> 39:40.103
Sure, you got to know that. Huh?

39:41.188 --> 39:43.858
You got to know that.

39:48.529 --> 39:49.697
So I'll see you later?

39:49.864 --> 39:53.410
Yeah, I'll see you at Georgetti's.
He wants to buy us a beer.

39:53.619 --> 39:57.164
He seems like a nice guy.
You wanna invite him to dinner?

39:57.331 --> 40:01.252
Hey, I'm working with this guy.
I'm not looking to adopt him.

40:01.419 --> 40:02.962
- See you.
- Yeah.

40:03.546 --> 40:05.799
- Andy's in the hall.
All right, let's go.

40:05.965 --> 40:08.594
- Hey, good job today.
Thanks, lieutenant.

40:08.761 --> 40:10.513
Lucky I gave you the full orientation.

40:10.679 --> 40:13.849
- It's always this quiet around here, huh?
Good night, guys.

40:15.101 --> 40:17.354
- Are you ready?
Yeah, I'm ready.

40:23.777 --> 40:24.986
And a soda.

40:25.863 --> 40:28.116
- Thanks, Bobby.
Yeah, thanks a lot.

40:28.282 --> 40:30.993
Thanks for making me
feel welcome, guys.

40:32.537 --> 40:34.038
So...

40:34.623 --> 40:37.334
- ...he raises pigeons.
- Is that right?

40:37.501 --> 40:40.546
Racing homers.
Flown them since I was a kid.

40:40.712 --> 40:43.173
Yeah, what's the actual limit there?

40:43.383 --> 40:45.718
The farthest they can
actually return from?

40:45.885 --> 40:47.679
I've had them come back
from 500 miles.

40:47.929 --> 40:51.474
- You must be some kind of trainer, huh?
It isn't training.

40:51.641 --> 40:53.561
It's what's inside them.

40:53.769 --> 40:56.981
I had these 10 birds, and I took them
up to Maine with me, right?

40:57.148 --> 41:00.192
An hour after I get back home,
I'm standing there on the roof...

41:00.359 --> 41:03.738
...and I'm watching them come in.
Every single one of them made it back.

41:03.905 --> 41:06.199
I raise fish.

41:06.366 --> 41:07.492
Is that right?

41:07.659 --> 41:09.619
Oh, yeah.
That's a big hobby with Andy.

41:09.786 --> 41:11.873
Saltwater tropicals.

41:12.039 --> 41:14.500
See, there's a hobby I never understood.

41:14.709 --> 41:16.294
I had buddies that raised pigeons-

41:16.461 --> 41:19.923
I got a clown fish couple.
They just had eggs.

41:20.340 --> 41:22.113
The morning, when I'm having
my coffee, the male...

41:22.148 --> 41:23.886
The morning, when I'm having
my coffee, the male...

41:24.052 --> 41:26.638
...he cleans each egg with his mouth.

41:26.805 --> 41:28.433
Never breaks one.

41:28.600 --> 41:32.979
Then the whole day while I'm working,
him and the wife are guarding that nest.

41:33.146 --> 41:35.690
They fan the water all over their eggs.

41:36.149 --> 41:38.569
Those are dedicated fish.

41:39.445 --> 41:42.239
You seen that kind of thing in pigeons?

41:42.406 --> 41:46.244
- Pigeons make good parents.
- Anyways, I gotta go.

41:46.411 --> 41:48.580
Yeah, I gotta go too.

41:48.789 --> 41:50.957
- Thanks for the beer, Bobby.
Yeah, me too.

41:51.124 --> 41:53.335
- I'll see you tomorrow, huh?
- I'll see you guys.

41:53.543 --> 41:56.172
Yeah.
- Take it easy.

41:56.672 --> 41:59.467
Good night, Dave.
Have a good night, guys.

42:03.931 --> 42:06.642
Feels good being back out
in the street, Andy.

42:08.685 --> 42:10.270
Forgot how much I missed it.

42:11.731 --> 42:15.902
So you took that p. c. job for what?

42:16.069 --> 42:17.278
A fast career track?

42:17.821 --> 42:20.365
I needed something with regular hours.

42:20.574 --> 42:23.077
I had some problems at home.

42:26.872 --> 42:29.250
My wife had breast cancer.

42:30.168 --> 42:31.753
She died last year.

42:35.006 --> 42:37.092
That had to be tough.

42:37.676 --> 42:39.387
I'm sorry.

42:41.681 --> 42:45.643
Look, I'm meeting a friend
for dinner. Wanna join us?

42:46.561 --> 42:48.272
Thanks, Andy, no.
You know what?

42:48.439 --> 42:50.524
I'm gonna go back
and do the fives on the case.

42:50.691 --> 42:53.277
Don't let me discourage you there.

42:57.407 --> 43:00.034
- So I'll see you tomorrow, huh?
- Yeah.

43:43.833 --> 43:46.503
I figured maybe I'd do
my own paperwork.

43:49.757 --> 43:51.300
Sure.

43:52.635 --> 43:56.972
This is some Greek stuff
from one of those Greek places.

43:58.099 --> 44:01.061
- You know, those grape leaf rolls.
- Dolma.

44:01.686 --> 44:04.272
Sylvia stopped for it,
the ADA you met.

44:04.439 --> 44:05.398
Thanks.

44:06.609 --> 44:08.736
Yeah, it was her idea.

44:15.410 --> 44:18.122
So I got about halfway
through the interviews.

44:18.288 --> 44:22.751
Let's just divvy up
what you got left there.

44:39.603 --> 44:41.815
I got to wear glasses now.

44:43.859 --> 44:45.944
It's all that paperwork, man.

44:46.111 --> 44:47.904
Yeah, I just need them for reading.
