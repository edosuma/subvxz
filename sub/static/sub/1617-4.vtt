Hello.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.410
I couldn't help but notice
a distinct lack of police cars...

16:01.640 --> 16:04.769
...when I got home. I knew
you wouldn't drop a dime on me.

16:04.960 --> 16:08.885
- So have you considered my offer?
- Offer? Heh.

16:09.080 --> 16:12.050
- That's one hell of a way to put it.
- It is an offer.

16:12.280 --> 16:16.490
It's a chance to do the kind of good
that compelled you to join the military.

16:17.200 --> 16:20.682

spoon in your mouth, Queen.

As much as he was doing it
to give me a chance to survive...

for his sins.

done by my family...
