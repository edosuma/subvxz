Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

00:36.937 --> 00:39.204
Our top story tonight,
scientists at NASA

00:39.206 --> 00:40.905
have made a fascinating
new discovery:

00:40.907 --> 00:43.842
the first directly observable
instance of a black hole,

00:43.844 --> 00:46.978
which appears to be located
just outside our solar system.

00:46.980 --> 00:48.413
Tricia Takanawa
has the story.

00:48.415 --> 00:52.183
Tom, I'm standing here
with Stephen Hawking,

00:52.185 --> 00:54.285
the first white
man I've ever met

00:54.287 --> 00:55.920
who knows math
better than me.

00:55.922 --> 00:59.424
Mr. Hawking, what does the
discovery of this black hole

00:59.426 --> 01:01.192
mean to you and
your research?

01:01.194 --> 01:02.794
(computerized voice):
I am overjoyed.

01:02.796 --> 01:06.431
This is the crowning
achievement of my career.

01:06.433 --> 01:10.268
It validates the work
of a lifetime.

01:10.270 --> 01:11.936
It certainly does.

01:11.938 --> 01:12.971
Back to you, Tom.

01:12.973 --> 01:13.905
MAN: All right,
we're clear.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.240
(normal voice):
I'm telling you, man,

01:15.242 --> 01:16.775
this shtick is
getting so old.

01:16.777 --> 01:17.809
That chair smells, dude.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.444
MAN:
Hey, Steve, surf's up!

01:19.446 --> 01:22.747
All right!
See you, bitch!

01:23.249 --> 01:25.116
Everyone, guess what.

01:25.118 --> 01:25.884
What?

01:25.886 --> 01:28.486
I have been selected.

01:28.488 --> 01:29.020
For what?

01:29.022 --> 01:32.323
Oh, nothing too important,
just jury duty!

01:32.325 --> 01:33.391
They have summoned me.

01:33.393 --> 01:36.094
I am part of an elite group
of individuals

01:36.096 --> 01:37.829
deemed intelligent enough
to decide

01:37.831 --> 01:40.398
the fate of a fellow citizen.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
(laughs)

01:42.002 --> 01:44.269
Ah, the amused laughter
of the envious.

01:44.271 --> 01:47.772
You know, they don't just
pick anybody for this job.

01:47.774 --> 01:48.339
Yeah, they do.

01:48.341 --> 01:50.108
Brian, perhaps I have not
made myself clear.

01:50.110 --> 01:53.311
I have been entrusted
to pass judgment upon others.

01:53.313 --> 01:56.848
Everybody gets called for
jury duty, you stupid idiot!

01:56.850 --> 01:57.482
I've been called!

01:57.484 --> 01:59.217
The only reason you've
never been called

01:59.219 --> 02:00.952
is that they use the
voter registration list,

02:00.954 --> 02:03.855
and this past election is the
first time you ever voted.

02:03.857 --> 02:04.489
I voted before.

02:04.491 --> 02:06.357
I stuffed the ballot box
at the Oscars.

02:06.359 --> 02:10.862
And the nominees for Best Actor
in a Leading Role are:

02:10.864 --> 02:13.998
Grover, Bluto from <i>Popeye,</i>

02:14.000 --> 02:16.434
a red guy, a boob

02:16.436 --> 02:18.136
and Daniel Day Lewis.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.271
And the Oscar goes to...

02:20.273 --> 02:23.808
a red guy!
(cheering, orchestra playing)

02:25.978 --> 02:27.412
Wait a second.
Y-You're saying that

02:27.414 --> 02:30.482
everyone is asked
to do jury duty?

02:30.484 --> 02:31.382
Yes, Peter.

02:31.384 --> 02:33.451
So then, I'm not special?

02:33.453 --> 02:36.187
TOMMY LEE:
Everyone's special, Peter.

02:36.189 --> 02:37.222
Rock Drummer
Tommy Lee?!

02:37.224 --> 02:39.991
And if your wife ever tells you
that you're not special,

02:39.993 --> 02:42.393
punch her really hard
right in her hepatitis.

02:42.395 --> 02:44.295
Thanks, Rock
Drummer Tommy Lee!

02:44.297 --> 02:46.164
Hey, and you know
what else is cool?

02:46.166 --> 02:48.133
Having sex
with sunglasses on.

02:48.135 --> 02:51.269
I've got a lot of
things to try now!

02:54.406 --> 02:56.141
I don't want
to go to jury duty.

02:56.143 --> 02:58.877
Turns out it's not a special
honor at all. It's lame.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.912
And the worst part is,
they try and trick you

03:00.914 --> 03:03.181
into getting excited
by putting "duty" in the title.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.549
So, you were excited
when you thought

03:04.551 --> 03:06.384
there was fecal
matter involved?

03:06.386 --> 03:08.019
What the hell
is fecal matter?

03:08.021 --> 03:09.020
Waste.
Huh?

03:09.022 --> 03:09.687
Doody.
Ha-ha!

03:09.689 --> 03:12.524
Peter, jury duty is an
important cornerstone

03:12.526 --> 03:13.558
in our democratic
society.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.027
Yeah, that's what separates us
from the monkeys.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.129
That and the armed guards
at the zoo.

03:18.131 --> 03:20.665
Man, they got some
sexy monkeys down there.

03:20.667 --> 03:22.967
I don't care,
jury duty sounds boring.

03:22.969 --> 03:24.369
I'm gonna get myself kicked out.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.604
Just like I got
kicked out of Coldplay.

03:26.606 --> 03:28.907
Guys, guys, I got an idea!

03:28.909 --> 03:33.077
How 'bout we do a song
that's not whiny bull crap?

03:35.781 --> 03:37.048
All right, ladies
and gentlemen.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.651
We're gonna ask you a series
of questions to determine

03:39.653 --> 03:42.220
whether or not you can
be impartial jurors.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.756
First off, do any of
you have any prejudices

03:44.758 --> 03:47.158
you feel the court
should know of?

03:47.160 --> 03:48.459
Yes, you sir.

03:48.461 --> 03:49.494
Ants. I hate ants.

03:49.496 --> 03:51.663
What?
That's right, you heard me.

03:51.665 --> 03:52.330
I'm an ant hater.

03:52.332 --> 03:54.599
Just like my daddy
and his daddy before him.

03:54.601 --> 03:56.968
So, if this is
an ant trial, forget it.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.303
No way I'm gonna be fair.

03:58.305 --> 04:00.538
Always making those
cocky little hills.

04:00.540 --> 04:03.074
Moving around
all single file and stupid.

04:03.076 --> 04:07.579
All ganging up and walking
my pie off the picnic blanket.

04:10.983 --> 04:11.616
(gasps)

04:11.618 --> 04:14.352
'Twas my pie gone missing!

04:14.354 --> 04:16.287
Sir, this is not
an ant trial.

04:16.289 --> 04:17.021
Oh.

04:17.023 --> 04:18.690
Is there anything else
we should know about?

04:18.692 --> 04:20.692
Oh, have you not heard?
Heard what?

04:20.694 --> 04:21.793
♪ A well-a-bird-bird-bird

04:21.795 --> 04:24.329
♪ B-Bird's the word,
a well-a-bird-bird-bird ♪

04:24.331 --> 04:26.564
♪ B-Bird's the word,
a well-a... ♪

04:27.800 --> 04:30.602
All right, now the prosecution
is about to show you

04:30.604 --> 04:32.103
items pertinent to this case

04:32.105 --> 04:33.071
that have been entered
into evidence.

04:33.073 --> 04:36.174
It is vitally important
that you look but don't touch,

04:36.176 --> 04:38.509
as any fingerprints
could contaminate them.

04:38.511 --> 04:41.112
Exhibit A, one
bloody Slinky.

04:41.114 --> 04:41.779
(sighs):
Oh.

04:41.781 --> 04:44.749
Exhibit B, one semen-covered
View-Master.

04:44.751 --> 04:45.750
(sighs louder):
Oh!

04:45.752 --> 04:47.986
With the reel of
the Grand Canyon.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.187
(sighs louder):
Oh!

04:49.189 --> 04:51.689
And a blood-splattered
Mr. Potato Head.

04:51.691 --> 04:53.024
(sighs louder):
Oh!

04:53.026 --> 04:54.726
And these socks
you really need.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.895
(groans):
Oh!

04:57.529 --> 05:00.598
All right, everyone, we're going
to take a ten-minute recess.

05:00.600 --> 05:03.001
I would like to remind members
of the jury that you are

05:03.003 --> 05:06.771
forbidden to discuss details of
the case outside the courtroom.

05:06.773 --> 05:08.373
(gavel bangs)

05:10.476 --> 05:12.210
PETER:
Hey, how about
this trial, huh?

05:12.212 --> 05:14.612
And all its details.
Let's discuss them.

05:14.614 --> 05:15.380
MAN:
He said not to!

05:15.382 --> 05:17.282
PETER:
Aw, hey, you know
how the judge told us

05:17.284 --> 05:18.983
not to make up
our minds beforehand?

05:18.985 --> 05:20.018
Let's make up our minds.

05:20.020 --> 05:20.885
MAN:
Griffin, shut up!

05:20.887 --> 05:22.120
PETER:
Hey, I know the judge said

05:22.122 --> 05:23.755
not to run in the hall,
but check this out!

05:23.757 --> 05:26.424
(rapid footsteps,
Peter giggling)

05:29.662 --> 05:31.095
JUDGE:
Griffin! Knock it off!

05:31.097 --> 05:33.331
PETER:
Hey, come on, Judge,
tell us the answer.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.000
The Mexican guy
did it, right?

05:37.836 --> 05:41.639
ANNOUNCER:
We now return to How Henry
Kissinger Met Your Mother.

05:41.641 --> 05:44.509
(German accent):
I was walking with my professor

05:44.511 --> 05:47.412
when I saw this
woman who was...

05:47.414 --> 05:50.148
(speaking gibberish)

05:50.150 --> 05:51.716
(canned laughter)

05:51.718 --> 05:55.520
(speaking gibberish)

05:55.522 --> 05:57.422
(canned laughter)

05:57.424 --> 06:00.692
(speaking gibberish)

06:00.694 --> 06:02.560
(canned laughter)

06:02.562 --> 06:04.429
Stewie, can you please move?

06:04.431 --> 06:05.330
You're blocking the TV.

06:05.332 --> 06:07.265
No! And I'll thank
you to quiet down.

06:07.267 --> 06:08.232
I'm playing
action figures.

06:08.234 --> 06:10.535
Prepare to be bested
on the battlefield, Lion-O.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.303
Oh, I don't think so, He-Man.

06:12.305 --> 06:12.737
Ow!

06:12.739 --> 06:14.339
Oh, I'm sorry,
did I punch you too hard?

06:14.341 --> 06:16.341
Yes, I suppose you don't know
your own strength.

06:16.343 --> 06:17.342
I mean, look at your muscles.

06:17.344 --> 06:19.210
Oh, stop it, you're the one
with the sick abs.

06:19.212 --> 06:22.313
God, my mouth is watering
just looking at you.

06:22.315 --> 06:23.247
Yeah, that's right.

06:23.249 --> 06:25.783
You buy your kids
ridiculously homoerotic dolls

06:25.785 --> 06:26.851
and then ask what happened?

06:26.853 --> 06:29.821
Yep. Your gay son
is on you, buddy.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.189
Explain that to your god.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.791
Off to another day
of jury duty, sweetie?

06:33.793 --> 06:34.726
Yeah, and it sucks.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.528
Even the vending machines
are out of order.

06:37.530 --> 06:39.630
(snickering)

06:39.632 --> 06:42.200
I don't want to go back
to stupid jury duty.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.435
There's got to be some
way I can get out of it.

06:44.437 --> 06:46.704
This is Tom Tucker
with some breaking news.

06:46.706 --> 06:48.806
NASA has made
the alarming announcement

06:48.808 --> 06:50.274
that the newly discovered
black hole

06:50.276 --> 06:53.244
at the edge of our solar system
appears to be expanding.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.446
Neptune and Pluto have
already been consumed,

06:55.448 --> 06:57.782
and scientists estimate
that the event horizon

06:57.784 --> 06:59.350
will reach Earth by tomorrow.

06:59.352 --> 07:00.251
That's right, Tom.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.686
Which means that
all life on Earth

07:01.688 --> 07:04.255
will be destroyed
within 24 hours.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.790
Oh, my God!

07:05.792 --> 07:08.259
Mom, is, is this for real?

07:08.261 --> 07:10.161
Well, it sure looks
that way, sweetie.

07:10.163 --> 07:13.131
It's the end
of the world!

07:13.133 --> 07:14.699
Holy crap!

07:14.701 --> 07:16.634
(knocking)

07:17.703 --> 07:21.506
Seems like I've run out
of waiting time.

07:25.310 --> 07:27.645
...but it looks like
Nicole Ritchie's baby

07:27.647 --> 07:28.780
is gonna be just fine.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.382
Also in the news,
the doomsday clock is ticking

07:31.384 --> 07:33.818
with less than 19 hours to go
before our planet

07:33.820 --> 07:35.720
is consumed by
an expanding black hole.

07:35.722 --> 07:38.956
TUCKER:
As Americans everywhere
face their last day on Earth,

07:38.958 --> 07:41.826
one can only imagine
how they're spending it.

07:41.828 --> 07:43.861
(doorbell rings)

07:43.863 --> 07:44.429
Hey, Mort.

07:44.431 --> 07:45.696
Now that the end
of the world is here,

07:45.698 --> 07:48.633
I just wanted to say
no hard feelings, huh?

07:48.635 --> 07:49.934
(buzzer sounds)
Ow!

07:49.936 --> 07:51.069
Psych! Ha-ha!

07:51.071 --> 07:52.737
Embedded in the hand.

07:52.739 --> 07:55.239
Have fun where you're going.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.408
Well, it's become clear,

07:57.410 --> 07:58.943
the only way
to avert this disaster

07:58.945 --> 08:03.181
is by writing a strongly-worded
letter to the black hole.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.015
"Dear space.

08:04.017 --> 08:06.617
"Well, you're just full
of surprises, aren't you?

08:06.619 --> 08:09.954
"You think you're so good
'cause you went to Choate.

08:09.956 --> 08:11.622
"Well, you're not
gonna be so tough

08:11.624 --> 08:12.990
"when I put a fish bowl
on my head

08:12.992 --> 08:17.528
and a rocket pack on my back and
come up there and punch you."

08:26.171 --> 08:28.673
Take that, Orion!

08:30.709 --> 08:31.476
That's right.

08:31.478 --> 08:35.546
All you are is a failed
production company.

08:36.348 --> 08:37.782
Joe, Joe, you
got to help me.

08:37.784 --> 08:39.350
You got to help
me get laid!

08:39.352 --> 08:40.785
What are you
talking about, Quagmire?

08:40.787 --> 08:41.652
I got to get laid!

08:41.654 --> 08:42.820
You got to help
me get laid!

08:42.822 --> 08:43.654
I've never had sex!

08:43.656 --> 08:45.857
What do you mean?
You've had sex a million times.

08:45.859 --> 08:46.958
Aw, that's
all bluster.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.826
I just talk big
for the fellas.

08:48.828 --> 08:49.927
I'm a virgin, Joe!

08:49.929 --> 08:51.929
I don't want to
die a virgin!

08:51.931 --> 08:52.930
Help me, please!

08:52.932 --> 08:55.500
Let me have sex
with Bonnie!

08:55.502 --> 08:56.701
(sighs)

08:56.703 --> 08:57.668
I guess so.

08:57.670 --> 09:00.605
For my friend,
on our last day on Earth.

09:00.607 --> 09:03.608
You're a good
man, Joe Swanson.

09:04.176 --> 09:05.443
How was your first time?

09:05.445 --> 09:06.878
Ah, I've had sex
lots of times.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.579
I just wanted to
have it again!

09:08.581 --> 09:11.182
(humming lively tune)

09:11.184 --> 09:12.116
Screw you!

09:12.118 --> 09:14.218
Who else but Quagmire?

09:14.220 --> 09:16.420
Well, Diane, now that
our time is almost up,

09:16.422 --> 09:18.956
just to lighten the mood,
we introduce a new feature

09:18.958 --> 09:20.758
called Tom's Crank Calls.

09:20.760 --> 09:23.728
Let's dial that number,
shall we?

09:23.730 --> 09:25.663
Hello, is this Megan Fox?

09:25.665 --> 09:27.632
I will kill you,
do you understand?

09:27.634 --> 09:29.367
If I can't have you,
no one can.

09:29.369 --> 09:32.637
I will kill you.
This is Tom Tucker.

09:32.639 --> 09:34.438
Well, I know who you are.

09:34.440 --> 09:35.006
(chuckles)

09:35.008 --> 09:37.909
It's fun to see how people react
when they're on the spot.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.578
Look, since these
are our final hours,

09:40.580 --> 09:42.513
I want you kids
to know how much

09:42.515 --> 09:43.781
your father
and I love you

09:43.783 --> 09:46.551
and how important
this family is to us.

09:46.553 --> 09:47.718
Oh, I'm scared.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.020
I wonder what it's like to die.

09:49.022 --> 09:52.089
I don't know, but from the
look in a stray cat's eyes

09:52.091 --> 09:53.891
when you're pushing
on its windpipe,

09:53.893 --> 09:55.860
I think it's
pretty terrifying.

09:55.862 --> 09:56.661
Like, panicky.

09:56.663 --> 09:59.330
Hey, Brian, what do you
think is gonna happ--

09:59.332 --> 10:00.831
What was that--

10:00.833 --> 10:01.832
You were praying.

10:01.834 --> 10:03.167
Come on, no, I wasn't.

10:03.169 --> 10:04.135
Yes, you were.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.503
You were
praying, I saw!

10:05.505 --> 10:06.938
No, man, it was a joke!

10:06.940 --> 10:07.638
You were praying!

10:07.640 --> 10:09.373
It was a goof!
I was goofing on you!

10:09.375 --> 10:12.777
You're, you're,
you're disingenuous.

10:14.179 --> 10:14.845
Hello, everybody.

10:14.847 --> 10:17.281
This is Montecore.
He's my lion.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.516
I have a lion now.

10:18.518 --> 10:19.483
(roars)

10:19.485 --> 10:20.651
Peter, what
the hell?!

10:20.653 --> 10:21.752
You know, I went
to the zoo last week

10:21.754 --> 10:24.255
and asked if I could do it,
and they told me to scram.

10:24.257 --> 10:25.122
Went to the zoo this morning

10:25.124 --> 10:26.457
with a shotgun
and now I have a lion.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.492
Does it bite?
Of course it bites, it's a lion.

10:28.494 --> 10:30.027
Peter, get
off the lion.

10:30.029 --> 10:32.763
We should spend some time
together as a family.

10:32.765 --> 10:33.998
I don't think so, Lois.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.499
But the world is ending.

10:35.501 --> 10:37.068
We should be spending
these final hours

10:37.070 --> 10:38.636
with the people we love most.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.538
Lois, a day ago,
I was stuck on jury duty.

10:40.540 --> 10:43.841
Today, I have a golden ticket
to do whatever the hell I want.

10:43.843 --> 10:44.675
I feel like an old guy

10:44.677 --> 10:46.777
who's reliving
his youthful shenanigans.

10:46.779 --> 10:49.080
Tell me about when
you were young, Grandpa.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.649
Oh, sonny, those
were crazy times.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.451
My friends and I
were out of control.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.853
We used to give each other
wet-willies and funny arms.

10:55.855 --> 10:59.757
We'd play dandy-balls and
legs-a-spread and penis-butt.

10:59.759 --> 11:01.459
Sounds kind of gay, Grandpa.

11:01.461 --> 11:02.760
It was gay. Everyone was.

11:02.762 --> 11:05.563
But, back then, we were
called pole-fancies.

11:05.565 --> 11:06.731
It was real,
good old-fashioned

11:06.733 --> 11:09.700
"grab the nearest tree and
hold on for dear life" gay,

11:09.702 --> 11:13.104
not today's fancy, featherbed,
thread-count gay.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.872
People got hurt back then!

11:14.874 --> 11:15.773
That's gay.

11:15.775 --> 11:17.508
Yeah, it was pretty gay.

11:19.878 --> 11:22.046
What the hell are you
doing with a musket?

11:22.048 --> 11:22.713
Last day on Earth.

11:22.715 --> 11:25.783
I've always wanted to save
a Native American family

11:25.785 --> 11:27.785
from rapacious cavalrymen.

11:28.186 --> 11:31.489
(soldiers yelling,
people screaming)

11:33.525 --> 11:34.525
(shrieks)

11:34.527 --> 11:38.262
<i>Yeah...</i>
<i>this one'll do</i> <i>nicely.</i>

11:38.264 --> 11:39.196
(gunshot)

11:39.198 --> 11:42.066
PETER:
Let her go.

11:42.467 --> 11:46.771
You don't have to be afraid
of him anymore.

11:48.373 --> 11:51.709
TUCKER:
Stay with us as the countdown
to Doomsday continues

11:51.711 --> 11:53.411
with just six more hours to go.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.746
The only thing that's nice
about this is,

11:55.748 --> 11:57.014
even though it's a Tuesday,

11:57.016 --> 12:00.284
it feels kind of like
it's a Friday.

12:00.286 --> 12:01.485
Peter, where are
you going?

12:01.487 --> 12:03.487
Last day on Earth,
last chance to do this.

12:03.489 --> 12:05.056
I'm gonna find
a black neighborhood

12:05.058 --> 12:05.923
and see what happens

12:05.925 --> 12:08.526
if I yell
the you-know-what word.

12:11.129 --> 12:13.864
They respected me
for saying it.

12:17.669 --> 12:19.537
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
this is it,

12:19.539 --> 12:20.604
our final minutes.

12:20.606 --> 12:22.106
Any moment now,
the Earth will be sucked

12:22.108 --> 12:23.874
into the gaping maw
of the black hole.

12:23.876 --> 12:25.843
We here at Channel Five would
like to leave you

12:25.845 --> 12:28.846
with some highlights of
mankind's brief existence,

12:28.848 --> 12:30.681
like the Battle of Hastings.

12:30.683 --> 12:33.417
Guys, if we win this,
we get Hastings!

12:33.419 --> 12:34.452
Yeah, let's do it!

12:34.454 --> 12:37.521
Let's go!
All right, Hastings!

12:37.523 --> 12:38.789
The Ottoman Empire.

12:38.791 --> 12:40.524
Ah, I could get
used to this.

12:40.526 --> 12:40.991
You know what?

12:40.993 --> 12:43.961
This is what I want
our empire to be about.

12:43.963 --> 12:46.163
The first television broadcast.

12:46.165 --> 12:48.933
(playing light melody)

12:59.111 --> 13:00.911
And with only
30 seconds to go,

13:00.913 --> 13:02.713
we thank you
for choosing Channel Five

13:02.715 --> 13:04.115
as your Armageddon network.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.716
Mom, where's Dad?!

13:05.718 --> 13:07.051
I don't know, Chris.

13:07.053 --> 13:08.085
Sorry I'm late, guys.

13:08.087 --> 13:09.453
Peter, where
have you been?!

13:09.455 --> 13:10.855
Look, you try scheduling
a haircut today.

13:10.857 --> 13:12.923
You know, you'd think
you'd want to spend

13:12.925 --> 13:14.825
your last day on Earth
with your family!

13:14.827 --> 13:16.060
Hey, I'm here,
aren't I?

13:16.062 --> 13:17.928
With only seconds left!

13:17.930 --> 13:19.397
Don't you love me?!

13:19.399 --> 13:20.598
Of course I love you, Lois!

13:20.600 --> 13:23.267
You're the most important person
in the world to me!

13:23.269 --> 13:25.836
You promise?
I promise!

13:27.139 --> 13:29.707
Ten, nine, eight...

13:29.709 --> 13:31.609
I just hate being
around the kids.

13:31.611 --> 13:33.144
What?!
...six, five,

13:33.146 --> 13:36.147
Sorry, I just thought
I'd be honest
since we're gonna die.

13:36.149 --> 13:39.216
...three, two, one.

13:39.218 --> 13:41.952
BOTH:
April Fools!

13:41.954 --> 13:42.586
What?!

13:42.588 --> 13:44.121
You gotta be
kiddin' me!

13:44.123 --> 13:45.189
We're not gonna die?!

13:45.191 --> 13:47.591
No, we're not gonna die!

13:47.593 --> 13:51.162
(all cheering)

13:51.164 --> 13:54.098
Wait, what did
Dad just say?

13:57.469 --> 13:58.969
Yes, April Fools!

13:58.971 --> 13:59.937
We at Channel Five News
concocted

13:59.939 --> 14:02.673
the whole black hole story
as part of our commitment

14:02.675 --> 14:03.974
to being festive
around the holidays.

14:03.976 --> 14:06.744
And with only 87 suicides
and widespread looting,

14:06.746 --> 14:10.581
we think this was a pretty
successful practical joke.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.116
You dicks!

14:12.118 --> 14:14.185
Hey, how do you like
that, Lois?

14:14.187 --> 14:15.119
We're gonna live!

14:15.121 --> 14:17.321
Peter, what did you mean
by what you said,

14:17.323 --> 14:19.924
you hate being
around the kids?

14:19.926 --> 14:21.559
Yeah, Dad,
what did you mean?

14:21.561 --> 14:23.894
Don't you like us?
Yeah, what gives?

14:23.896 --> 14:24.895
Well... Oh, come on.

14:24.897 --> 14:26.030
I-I didn't mean that.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.131
I was just joking around.

14:27.133 --> 14:28.132
Hey, give me a big hug.

14:28.134 --> 14:30.534
How about a big hug
for old Dad?

14:30.536 --> 14:32.102
Kids, why don't you
go upstairs

14:32.104 --> 14:33.971
so your father
and I can talk.

14:33.973 --> 14:35.873
Yeah, come on, Meg and Chris.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.808
Let's get out of here.

14:38.543 --> 14:40.911
Well, I'm off to serve food
at the soup kitchen.

14:40.913 --> 14:42.346
Now that I lived
through this,

14:42.348 --> 14:43.547
I kind of have to keep

14:43.549 --> 14:44.982
a promise I made
to someone.

14:44.984 --> 14:46.083
STEWIE:
It's God!

14:46.085 --> 14:47.651
Peter, what did you mean?

14:47.653 --> 14:49.253
(sighs) All right,
you want the truth?

14:49.255 --> 14:50.955
They bore the hell
out of me, Lois.

14:50.957 --> 14:52.356
Bore the hell
out of you?!

14:52.358 --> 14:53.624
They're your kids!

14:53.626 --> 14:54.658
I know,
and I love them,

14:54.660 --> 14:57.161
but don't you just sometimes
wish they'd run away

14:57.163 --> 14:59.563
or get kidnapped
and be made to work

14:59.565 --> 15:00.865
in a Temple of Doom?

15:00.867 --> 15:04.368
(hums Temple of Doom theme)

15:04.370 --> 15:06.637
How can you
even say that?!

15:06.639 --> 15:07.738
Because, Lois, Meg tells a story

15:07.740 --> 15:09.240
that makes you want to blow
your brains out,

15:09.242 --> 15:10.641
Stewie just sits there,

15:10.643 --> 15:12.676
and Chris is always leaving
his Russian mice around.

15:12.678 --> 15:13.644
Get out of here!

15:13.646 --> 15:15.946
(Russian accent):
Okay, okay, you don't have
to yell.

15:15.948 --> 15:18.115
Let us go find
<i>das vaginya.</i>

15:18.117 --> 15:21.085
Listen to you! You don't
know your own kids!

15:21.087 --> 15:22.052
That's the problem!

15:22.054 --> 15:23.954
It's not them, it's you!

15:23.956 --> 15:25.656
Me?!
Yes, you!

15:25.658 --> 15:26.757
And you know what?

15:26.759 --> 15:29.226
You've hurt your kids worse
than any black hole could!

15:29.228 --> 15:30.594
Lois, you're overreacting.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.963
This'll all blow over
by tomorrow.

15:36.668 --> 15:38.102
Morning, (bleep).

15:38.104 --> 15:39.036
Ha-ha, I'm just kidding!

15:39.038 --> 15:40.871
So what do we got,
pancakes? Cool!

15:40.873 --> 15:43.307
Hey, what's on tap
for school today, kids?

15:43.309 --> 15:44.708
Shut up, Dad.
Whatever.

15:44.710 --> 15:48.078
So, Chris, how, uh, how are
all your friends at school?

15:48.080 --> 15:49.079
What do you care?

15:49.081 --> 15:51.048
You don't even know
who my friends are.

15:51.050 --> 15:52.182
Sure, I do.

15:52.184 --> 15:55.219
Um, Chandler...

15:55.221 --> 15:57.054
Fonzie...

15:57.056 --> 15:58.255
and Remington Steele?

15:58.257 --> 15:59.723
You got lucky, Dad.

15:59.725 --> 16:02.192
So, Stewie, how's everything
going in Lego Land?

16:02.194 --> 16:03.894
Oh, pretty good.
I made a spaceship...

16:03.896 --> 16:05.796
Wait a minute.
I'm not talking to you.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.365
Come on, guys. Let's go eat
in the living room.

16:08.367 --> 16:10.601
It stinks in here.

16:10.735 --> 16:12.803
Oh, no, does it stink
'cause I farted?

16:12.805 --> 16:14.672
'Cause sometimes
I can suck 'em back up.

16:14.674 --> 16:17.041
I think we can make up
some of these losses

16:17.043 --> 16:18.242
in the third quarter.

16:18.244 --> 16:19.276
(Peter farts)

16:19.278 --> 16:20.844
(pneumatic sucking sound)

16:20.846 --> 16:21.879
What was that?

16:21.881 --> 16:23.047
What was what?

16:23.049 --> 16:23.948
Oh, nothing.

16:23.950 --> 16:26.016
I thought I smelled a fart,
but now I don't.

16:26.018 --> 16:29.320
They, uh, they're really pissed
at me, aren't they?

16:29.322 --> 16:31.388
Oh, look who's
starting to get it.

16:31.390 --> 16:34.058
Peter, they heard you say
you hate being around them.

16:34.060 --> 16:35.960
They, they know
you have no interest

16:35.962 --> 16:36.961
in getting to know them.

16:36.963 --> 16:38.062
I mean, how-how would you feel?

16:38.064 --> 16:40.030
Well, right now
I feel like a jerk.

16:40.032 --> 16:41.832
Peter, if you really
do care about your kids,

16:41.834 --> 16:45.269
you're gonna have
to earn back their
respect and affection.

16:45.271 --> 16:46.170
How do I do that?

16:46.172 --> 16:47.771
You gotta spend
time with them

16:47.773 --> 16:49.707
and make their interests
your interests.

16:49.709 --> 16:52.009
(sighs) I guess
you're right, Lois.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.377
I'm always screwing up.

16:53.379 --> 16:56.113
Like that time
with Jason Mraz.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.649
Oh, my God!
You're Jason Mraz!

16:58.651 --> 16:59.383
No, I'm not.

16:59.385 --> 17:01.018
I'm just some
guy with a hat.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.354
Yeah, that's who
Jason Mraz is!

17:07.225 --> 17:10.561
(sweetly):
Hey, buddy.

17:11.096 --> 17:12.796
What's going on?

17:13.999 --> 17:15.666
You having
your period?
What?!

17:15.668 --> 17:18.369
I'm just trying
to take an interest
in your interests.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.970
My period's
not an interest.

17:19.972 --> 17:21.472
It's something
that happens to me

17:21.474 --> 17:23.140
that I cannot control.

17:23.142 --> 17:23.941
Gross.

17:23.943 --> 17:27.344
All right, I'm gonna
go talk to Chris.

17:27.912 --> 17:30.547
Hi, Chris.
Hello... Peter.

17:30.549 --> 17:31.882
You know, I was
just thinking,

17:31.884 --> 17:34.985
when I was your age, my Uncle
Roy shared a beer with me.

17:34.987 --> 17:37.888
I drank it, and I was so
excited, I fell asleep.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.890
I must have tossed and
turned something fierce,

17:39.892 --> 17:42.059
'cause when I woke up,
my pants were off.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.128
Never saw much of
Uncle Roy after that.

17:44.130 --> 17:45.863
Turns out we weren't
even related.

17:45.865 --> 17:48.999
Anyway, I thought
him sharing that
beer with me

17:49.001 --> 17:50.067
was the coolest
thing ever.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.269
And I know nowadays
things are different...

17:52.271 --> 17:53.504
so I got some
crystal meth.

17:53.506 --> 17:56.206
I figured we could do it
together as father and son.

17:56.208 --> 17:57.274
I don't know
about that.

17:57.276 --> 17:59.410
Tell you what,
I'll get us started.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.011
(sniffing)

18:01.013 --> 18:05.282
Ah... That feels...
that feels better.

18:05.284 --> 18:06.483
You sure
that stuff is okay?

18:06.485 --> 18:09.053
All I know is the guys
who made it are dead.

18:09.055 --> 18:11.855
Why is there no hole
in this wall?

18:11.857 --> 18:14.725
You know, this thing
is bugging me.

18:15.860 --> 18:18.696
All right, I'm
gonna take a hike.

18:21.099 --> 18:24.268
So, you gonna introduce me
to your pals?

18:24.270 --> 18:25.436
That's Trapjaw.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.570
That's Optimus Prime.

18:26.572 --> 18:27.538
That's Destro.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.173
And that's a Care Bear.

18:29.175 --> 18:30.207
You having a tea party?

18:30.209 --> 18:32.409
No, we're working out
a land deal.

18:32.411 --> 18:34.178
Trapjaw is trying
to get a variance

18:34.180 --> 18:36.080
to build an unpermitted
structure within ten feet

18:36.082 --> 18:37.448
of Optimus Prime's
property line.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.184
Destro is the City Councilman
who's telling Trapjaw

18:40.186 --> 18:42.052
that he has to file it
as an accessory structure,

18:42.054 --> 18:44.455
and even then it can only be
built at the rear of the lot.

18:44.457 --> 18:47.324
And the Care Bear
is just a Care Bear.

18:47.326 --> 18:50.194
I am so (bleep) ready!

18:53.498 --> 18:55.265
I don't know, Lois,
I tried my best.

18:55.267 --> 18:58.268
I don't know what else
I possibly could have done.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.971
Peter, you're just gonna
have to do better.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.107
Somehow you gotta
let those kids know

19:03.109 --> 19:04.341
that they matter to you.

19:04.343 --> 19:06.810
(sighs) I'll try, Lois.

19:09.347 --> 19:10.380
Kids, come in here!

19:10.382 --> 19:13.183
Your father's got
something to say!

19:16.054 --> 19:18.522
Look, I know you kids
ain't too happy

19:18.524 --> 19:19.056
with your dad right now,

19:19.058 --> 19:22.025
but I hope at least you
could see that I'm trying.

19:22.027 --> 19:25.529
I mean, I know sometimes we
don't get along with each other.

19:25.531 --> 19:27.097
Hell, if we
weren't all related,

19:27.099 --> 19:29.299
this would be like the worst
table at the wedding.

19:29.301 --> 19:31.168
But we're, we're part
of a family.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.203
And I'm still your father.

19:33.205 --> 19:34.972
And I promise I love you.

19:34.974 --> 19:38.976
Well, then how come you said
you hated spending time with us?

19:38.978 --> 19:41.612
Look, I may not have said
exactly what I meant.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.747
But I-I can still be your dad

19:43.749 --> 19:46.183
even if we don't have any
of the same interests.

19:46.185 --> 19:49.286
So what do you say,
are we a family again?

19:50.054 --> 19:51.255
I don't buy it.
Me neither.

19:51.257 --> 19:53.457
When you jumped through
my ceiling, you let an owl in.

19:53.459 --> 19:55.125
I know they're
supposed to be wise,

19:55.127 --> 19:58.362
but all it did was shriek
and poop out half-digested mice.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.464
Well, then I guess
there's only one thing

20:00.466 --> 20:02.432
I can do to regain your love.

20:02.434 --> 20:05.002
Who wants a brand new Xbox?

20:05.004 --> 20:06.370
Yay!
Oh, Daddy!

20:06.372 --> 20:09.807
Oh, my God,
you're the best father ever!

20:09.809 --> 20:13.243
(all clamoring)

20:13.245 --> 20:16.346
Well, I guess if you can't earn
your kids' respect,

20:16.348 --> 20:17.648
you can always buy it.

20:17.650 --> 20:20.517
(all laughing)

20:20.519 --> 20:24.488
There's some awesome stuff
in the garbage.

20:30.495 --> 20:32.663
Dad, can we please have
a turn at the Xbox?

20:32.665 --> 20:35.599
Just a second, Meg.
I'm still trying
to get the hang of this.

20:35.601 --> 20:36.633
Okay, guys,
tell me again,

20:36.635 --> 20:39.303
uh, now, which one
do I press to shoot now?

20:39.305 --> 20:41.471
Damn it! Ah, crap.

20:41.473 --> 20:43.340
TEENAGE BOY:
Who's the douchebag
who keeps dying?

20:43.342 --> 20:45.509
PETER:
I'm not
a douchebag. I'm new.

20:45.511 --> 20:46.577
Look, if you're
no good,

20:46.579 --> 20:48.278
why don't you just go
hide till the end?

20:48.280 --> 20:50.547
PETER:
All right, I'll go crouch
behind the, uh...

20:50.549 --> 20:51.548
Is this a crouch button?

20:51.550 --> 20:53.584
PLAYER:
Ah! Who dropped
a grenade?!

20:53.586 --> 20:54.785
Idiot!
Learn how to play!

20:54.787 --> 20:57.254
Moron!
QUAGMIRE:
You suck!
