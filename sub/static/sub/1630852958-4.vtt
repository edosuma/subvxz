WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.876
Charter number two.

00:03.876 --> 00:05.125
Oh, no!

00:05.125 --> 00:07.417
It's ----ing Erica.

00:07.417 --> 00:08.751
Tatas for Trump.

00:08.751 --> 00:11.667
These people are disrespectful,
they're emotionally draining.

00:11.667 --> 00:14.626
This is the worst news ever.

00:14.626 --> 00:17.334
Oh, here they go.

00:17.334 --> 00:18.167
Hello.

00:18.167 --> 00:19.334
How are you?

00:19.334 --> 00:20.375
Who are you gonna hook up with?

00:20.375 --> 00:22.959
You, Dais.
Come here.

00:22.959 --> 00:24.918
Get the hell away from me!

00:24.918 --> 00:26.375
Mwah, mwah, mwah!

00:26.375 --> 00:27.959
Looks like the transom
hasn't been done at all.

00:27.959 --> 00:30.125
-Yes, it has.
-[bleep] me.

00:30.125 --> 00:34.334
Tom, keep an eye out
for stuff like that.

00:34.334 --> 00:35.959
Putting things away,
tidying the bar,

00:35.959 --> 00:37.459
that was just not
important at all?

00:37.459 --> 00:39.959
-Whoa, whoa, whoa...
-Am I being bitchy?

00:39.959 --> 00:43.167
Gabriela is not my boss.
Sit down.

00:43.167 --> 00:44.792
This whole title of
second stew, third stew

00:44.792 --> 00:46.292
is a little obsolete right now.

00:46.292 --> 00:48.542
She wants to be second stew,

00:48.542 --> 00:50.542
and I think she's trying to
make me look bad at this point.

00:50.542 --> 00:52.626
-I just wanna double-check...
-Yeah.

00:52.626 --> 00:53.959
The dinner menu
for this evening.

00:53.959 --> 00:56.876
-Watermelon gazpachio.

00:56.876 --> 00:58.375
Okay. Um... okay.

00:58.375 --> 01:00.292
Sounds like we're just
eating a bunch of crap.

01:00.292 --> 01:01.918
Just tell me what
the [bleep] you want.

01:01.918 --> 01:04.626
We have grilled vegetable
and a marinated steak.

01:04.626 --> 01:06.876
I don't like any
pink in my steak.

01:06.876 --> 01:08.292
Ah!

01:08.292 --> 01:09.459
[bleep] yeah, I don't
like this either.

01:09.459 --> 01:10.959
I don't like this either.

01:10.959 --> 01:12.792
I've gotten better food
at the ballpark.

01:12.792 --> 01:31.417
Chuck, go [bleep] yourself.

01:31.417 --> 01:33.584
My mom and Chuck
have been disappointed...

01:33.584 --> 01:36.417
don't say you weren't,
because I'll be mad.

01:36.417 --> 01:40.209
Don't say you weren't.

01:40.209 --> 01:41.459
Babe, you can come
eat the omelette.

01:41.459 --> 01:43.501
I just took a bite,
I don't want it.

01:43.501 --> 01:45.751
-It's not good, it's not good.
-Babe, you eat McDonald's.

01:45.751 --> 01:47.292
But McDonald's
is better than this.

01:47.292 --> 01:49.125
I still don't understand
what the problem is.

01:49.125 --> 01:50.959
Okay, she did not like
the food at all last night.

01:50.959 --> 01:52.334
I'm being real about it.

01:52.334 --> 01:55.501
You don't put
sweet sauce on a steak.

01:55.501 --> 01:57.125
So, now I feel like
I'm losing money

01:57.125 --> 01:59.125
by just sitting here and looking
at this disgusting food.

01:59.125 --> 02:00.584
And that's a bitchy
thing to say,

02:00.584 --> 02:02.167
because I would not
call it disgusting.

02:02.167 --> 02:03.375
I think that's inedible.

02:03.375 --> 02:05.292
Just to warn you, Charles,

02:05.292 --> 02:07.417
he's, like, "This is
----ing disgusting."

02:07.417 --> 02:09.626
He's like,
"Dinner's disgusting."

02:09.626 --> 02:10.959
He doesn't like his omelette,
he didn't like the steak.

02:10.959 --> 02:12.250
Okay.

02:12.250 --> 02:13.292
He wouldn't know a
----ing good meal

02:13.292 --> 02:15.959
if it smacked him in the face.

02:15.959 --> 02:17.459
Don't... he's being...

02:17.459 --> 02:19.083
I mean, like,
I'm, like, shaking.

02:19.083 --> 02:20.459
Okay, whatever.
He's being so awful.

02:20.459 --> 02:21.751
Whatever, whatever, whatever.

02:21.751 --> 02:23.334
He's being aggressive and mean.

02:23.334 --> 02:24.542
-Whatever he's saying...
-Well, I just wanna warn you.

02:24.542 --> 02:25.209
[bleep] that guy.

02:25.209 --> 02:26.626
If Chuck say that to my face,

02:26.626 --> 02:28.876
I would not be sitting
here right now.

02:28.876 --> 02:31.417
I'm gonna be okay.

02:31.417 --> 02:33.083
How was last night's
meal for you?

02:33.083 --> 02:34.792
I mean, I think it
was good for me,

02:34.792 --> 02:36.209
but I have a different palate.

02:36.209 --> 02:38.584
But I would be happy if
I could eat quality food.

02:38.584 --> 02:41.542
Well, I'm going
to find a solution.

02:41.542 --> 02:43.584
Tonight's dinner is gonna
be fantastic, I promise.

02:43.584 --> 02:44.792
-Thank you, okay.
-All right?

02:44.792 --> 02:46.209
Thank you very much.

02:46.209 --> 02:47.959
Quick question...
me, Tom, and her are going now?

02:47.959 --> 02:49.792
The beach picnic?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:49.792 --> 02:51.209
Come back for the food.

02:51.209 --> 02:52.834
-Mm-hmm, yeah.
-Drop that off...

02:52.834 --> 02:54.334
-Yeah.
-Then swap me and her

02:54.334 --> 02:56.501
with the guests, and then
she's on the boat

02:56.501 --> 02:58.834
and I'm with the guests at the
beach with everything there.

02:58.834 --> 02:59.834
Okay, yeah, that sounds good.

02:59.834 --> 03:01.167
-Yeah?
-Okay, cool.

03:01.167 --> 03:02.959
Were you all happy with
the food last night?

03:02.959 --> 03:06.292
Because my mom really wasn't.
Chuck didn't like it, either.

03:06.292 --> 03:07.459
Really.

03:07.459 --> 03:08.918
He likes to bitch,
like I told you.

03:08.918 --> 03:09.918
How you doing?

03:09.918 --> 03:11.209
All good, all good.

03:11.209 --> 03:12.792
I just had a long chat
with them about...

03:12.792 --> 03:14.918
I think a couple of
them weren't happy last night.

03:14.918 --> 03:16.417
Yeah.

03:16.417 --> 03:17.959
And then one of them
wasn't happy with his eggs.

03:17.959 --> 03:19.667
I guess you made him a
couple different omelettes?

03:19.667 --> 03:21.167
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

03:21.167 --> 03:22.876
I think it was
a misunderstanding

03:22.876 --> 03:24.542
with the tomato.

03:24.542 --> 03:26.792
I don't really get it, but the
omelette looked delicious,

03:26.792 --> 03:27.959
so I don't know.

03:27.959 --> 03:30.292
But let's, you humor them.

03:30.292 --> 03:34.125
I'll get Charles, Cindi,
you, and I, Daisy, together.

03:34.125 --> 03:35.667
Let you hear it
from their ears...

03:35.667 --> 03:37.209
-Yeah.
-What they want.

03:37.209 --> 03:38.501
That'll be the trick.

03:38.501 --> 03:40.792
If a guest has
a legitimate complaint,

03:40.792 --> 03:41.959
of course I wanna hear about it.

03:41.959 --> 03:44.209
But who comes on a luxury yacht

03:44.209 --> 03:46.417
and says it's not
as good as McDonald's?

03:46.417 --> 03:48.792
Show some class.
Show some class.

03:48.792 --> 03:50.584
-We'll find a solution.
-I'm okay.

03:50.584 --> 03:51.959
Good.

03:51.959 --> 03:57.501
He's gonna complain because that
doesn't taste like a Happy Meal.

03:57.501 --> 03:58.959
Come in.

03:58.959 --> 04:00.167
-Come in.
-I have your coffee.

04:00.167 --> 04:01.626
Thank you.

04:01.626 --> 04:02.959
So, like, so where's
my sunglasses,

04:02.959 --> 04:04.375
and, like, where's my hat,

04:04.375 --> 04:06.167
and where's all
my important sh--

04:06.167 --> 04:08.501
that I can't find because it's
----ing damn dark in here.

04:08.501 --> 04:11.167
How many trays?
Seven trays and two tables,

04:11.167 --> 04:12.584
we can bring a gazebo.

04:12.584 --> 04:14.959
So, the plan is
that you're gonna go over

04:14.959 --> 04:17.459
to the beach with Tom and Gary.

04:17.459 --> 04:18.626
Mm-hmm.

04:18.626 --> 04:19.792
Then you're gonna
swap out with me.

04:19.792 --> 04:20.959
Okay.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.334
All right, let's keep going.

04:22.334 --> 04:28.542
Ah.

04:28.542 --> 04:29.334
[bleep]!

04:29.334 --> 04:30.709
-Did you drop it?
-Yeah, you did.

04:30.709 --> 04:32.125
There it goes.

04:32.125 --> 04:34.125
Why would you put it inside?

04:34.125 --> 04:35.459
I told you,
you've got rope in there.

04:35.459 --> 04:38.626
Just put it on top of the bag.

04:38.626 --> 04:42.626
-You set me up to fail there.
-No, no, no.

04:42.626 --> 04:46.709
What you shaking your
head about, earlier?

04:46.709 --> 04:48.250
Yeah.

04:48.250 --> 04:53.083
I just wanna be able to
eat something that's edible.

04:53.083 --> 04:54.959
Yeah, he came out pretty
aggressive this morning.

04:54.959 --> 04:57.334
Okay, we can start plating food.

04:57.334 --> 04:59.417
Is that everything
for now, Gabs?

04:59.417 --> 05:00.501
Yes.

05:00.501 --> 05:01.792
-You want to put it here?
-Yeah.

05:01.792 --> 05:03.334
What's all this alcohol

05:03.334 --> 05:07.751
that everybody's drinking
that I don't have?

05:07.751 --> 05:09.042
Yeah.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.584
Can you turn this
horizontally, please?

05:10.584 --> 05:13.959
----ing hell, I don't get
paid enough for this.

05:13.959 --> 05:15.334
Were you ready to go in
a few minutes?

05:15.334 --> 05:16.542
Should I get the tender
to pick us up?

05:16.542 --> 05:17.375
Yeah, okay.

05:17.375 --> 05:18.375
You want a table here?

05:18.375 --> 05:19.792
-Yeah.
-Okie-dokie.

05:19.792 --> 05:21.000
Is that everything?

05:21.000 --> 05:22.792
Yeah, let's rock and roll.

05:22.792 --> 05:24.959
We've got some legs down here.

05:24.959 --> 05:26.292
Well done, dickhead.

05:26.292 --> 05:27.751
Maybe put the roof on the
----ing thing

05:27.751 --> 05:29.292
before we start, eh?

05:29.292 --> 05:30.667
Can you take a picture of
me out there on the deck?

05:30.667 --> 05:32.792
Gotta get my Instagram
photos, girlfriend.

05:32.792 --> 05:35.667
-How's it going?
-Not well.

05:35.667 --> 05:38.334
Oh, my [bleep], really, eh?

05:38.334 --> 05:39.417
Yeah.

05:39.417 --> 05:41.542
Just tie it up there,
I guess, maybe. You got it?

05:41.542 --> 05:43.292
Do you wanna set up,
like, the bar station?

05:43.292 --> 05:45.209
-Yeah.
-And I'll finish this.

05:45.209 --> 05:48.167
Please.

05:48.167 --> 05:49.876
Okay, let's go, let's go,
let's go.

05:49.876 --> 05:53.459
I've never had this in my life,
this kind of feedback.

05:53.459 --> 05:55.959
By tomorrow,
I'm gonna be drinking.

05:55.959 --> 05:58.167
I know it's difficult,
but don't let it get to you.

05:58.167 --> 05:59.959
No, no, it's... no.

05:59.959 --> 06:01.417
Trust me, I was there,
listening to the whole thing.

06:01.417 --> 06:03.959
-Uh-huh?
-The guy's ----ing crazy.

06:03.959 --> 06:05.375
Yeah?

06:05.375 --> 06:07.292
The guy's got the taste
buds of a Billy goat.

06:07.292 --> 06:09.709
He wants ----ing Big Macs
and cheeseburgers.

06:09.709 --> 06:14.542
How can we make that thing
look less ugly?

06:14.542 --> 06:16.751
I feel like I came into this
season a little bit

06:16.751 --> 06:20.667
too cocky and confident.

06:20.667 --> 06:22.000
[vomiting]

06:22.000 --> 06:23.501
[whistles]

06:23.501 --> 06:26.042
Don't ever hang fenders
over until we're there.

06:26.042 --> 06:28.125
But I know I can do better
than this,

06:28.125 --> 06:33.834
and I wanna show Gary that I'm
not a complete ----ing idiot.

06:33.834 --> 06:39.667
Few more of those.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.959
Wow. Seriously?

06:41.959 --> 06:43.959
Oh, what happened here?

06:43.959 --> 06:46.417
Did you see this?

06:46.417 --> 06:47.667
Oh, my God.

06:47.667 --> 06:49.626
Accidents happen, but you know,

06:49.626 --> 06:52.125
it was a kind of
a dumb thing to do.

06:52.125 --> 06:54.125
The couch is probably
worth 50 grand.

06:54.125 --> 06:56.083
So, that's just stupid.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.959
Are you guys ready
to go to the beach?

06:57.959 --> 06:58.959
I've been ready.

06:58.959 --> 07:00.501
Is that alcohol?

07:00.501 --> 07:01.959
I think there's tons of
alcohol on the beach,

07:01.959 --> 07:03.792
but if you want, we can make
you up one before you go.

07:03.792 --> 07:04.959
Oh, I'm sure there'll be
alcohol on the beach.

07:04.959 --> 07:13.000
No, that's fine.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Did you see the couch?

07:15.000 --> 07:25.209
I literally walked in
and was like...

07:25.209 --> 07:26.834
Long legs coming.

07:26.834 --> 07:28.959
That water's cold,
and I'm not getting in it.

07:28.959 --> 07:32.459
Okay, I have to say the chef
did a really good job with this.

07:32.459 --> 07:33.375
Yes.

07:33.375 --> 07:34.792
I haven't eaten it yet,

07:34.792 --> 07:36.542
so I'll reserve that until
I eat the food.

07:36.542 --> 07:38.125
-That's true.
-Let's wait until we eat it.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.125
The whole reason he came
on this trip was the food.

07:40.125 --> 07:41.918
You either have talent,
or you don't.

07:41.918 --> 07:43.375
You either...

07:43.375 --> 07:44.501
It's like you either know
how to make an omelette

07:44.501 --> 07:46.042
that's not brown, or you don't.

07:46.042 --> 07:47.626
This has been a sh---show
of a morning,

07:47.626 --> 07:50.876
and I really need this beach
picnic to go to plan.

07:50.876 --> 07:52.000
Can I get you anything, Charles?

07:52.000 --> 07:55.584
Hopefully...
I guess...

07:55.584 --> 07:59.292
It's right here, babe.
You love lox.

07:59.292 --> 08:02.083
My God, just eat the food
and shut the [bleep] up.

08:02.083 --> 08:03.667
Dais?

08:03.667 --> 08:06.626
This looks good.

08:06.626 --> 08:09.209
It's so good.

08:09.209 --> 08:10.751
-It's good.
-Hey, Daisy?

08:10.751 --> 08:12.292
-Yes.
-Great food.

08:12.292 --> 08:13.584
Oh, good, I'm happy you like it.

08:13.584 --> 08:15.417
I think I was just up...
I'm, like...

08:15.417 --> 08:16.959
I think I'm just
a grouch in the morning.

08:16.959 --> 08:19.626
That's okay.

08:19.626 --> 08:20.959
Everyone has their things.

08:20.959 --> 08:23.125
If I'm up too late,
I get grouchy.

08:23.125 --> 08:29.167
Are you ----ing kidding me?

08:29.167 --> 08:30.167
I wanted one.

08:30.167 --> 08:31.959
Oh, you did?

08:31.959 --> 08:33.959
But I wanna see now what's for
dinner, which I don't know now.

08:33.959 --> 08:36.334
-I need to talk to them.
-Yeah. Don't lose it at them.

08:36.334 --> 08:37.584
Me?

08:37.584 --> 08:39.292
I'm not gonna punch him.

08:39.292 --> 08:41.584
Oh, this is so good.

08:41.584 --> 08:43.250
You want to?
Okay, I'll come with you.

08:43.250 --> 08:45.250
The one thing I like
is ice in water.

08:45.250 --> 08:46.626
Yeah, New York, the same.

08:46.626 --> 08:48.250
New York, they don't
put ice in water.

08:48.250 --> 08:49.167
Mm-hmm.

08:49.167 --> 08:50.584
They don't even wanna
give you water.

08:50.584 --> 08:54.584
Mm-hmm.

08:54.584 --> 08:56.375
You yell at people in New York,
you'll get hit in the face.

08:56.375 --> 08:58.083
You get more bees with honey.

08:58.083 --> 09:01.209
I've gotten pretty far in
life thus far acting this way.

09:01.209 --> 09:02.959
I think I'm gonna keep the way
I act,

09:02.959 --> 09:05.542
and if people don't like the
way I act, then that's too bad,

09:05.542 --> 09:06.959
and they don't need
to be around me.

09:06.959 --> 09:10.292
If you can help me
clear the table?

09:10.292 --> 09:13.042
Wait, something happened?

09:13.042 --> 09:14.375
-Wait, who said that?
-Your friend.

09:14.375 --> 09:15.792
-Jenelle?
-Yeah.

09:15.792 --> 09:17.083
You'll get your ass kicked
about what?

09:17.083 --> 09:18.792
If I said...

09:18.792 --> 09:21.459
if I yelled in New York about
not getting ice in my water.

09:21.459 --> 09:22.792
-Does she live in New York?
-No.

09:22.792 --> 09:24.542
So then... has she
ever been to New York?

09:24.542 --> 09:27.125
-I don't know.
-That's ridiculous.

09:27.125 --> 09:29.626
If she was not my hairdresser,
I would let you be a bitch.

09:29.626 --> 09:32.834
But I don't wanna have
to find a new hairstylist.

09:32.834 --> 09:34.375
This is our last day.
Relax.

09:34.375 --> 09:36.042
I want my retribution.
How do I get it?

09:36.042 --> 09:37.584
That bitch over there
talking sh--...

09:37.584 --> 09:38.834
to the person that's
paying for it...

09:38.834 --> 09:39.876
What?

09:39.876 --> 09:41.250
I'm not gonna fight with Jenelle

09:41.250 --> 09:42.667
because she's the only
that gets my hair.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.042
No, it's all good,
it's all good.

09:44.042 --> 09:46.709
Oh, no.
Hey, Rhett, what's up?

09:46.709 --> 09:47.792
-No.
-You sure?

09:47.792 --> 09:51.792
Yeah.

09:51.792 --> 09:57.209
Oh, dear God.

09:57.209 --> 09:58.626
-Coming up...
-Ow!

09:58.626 --> 09:59.626
I cut my head.

09:59.626 --> 10:00.626
Oh sh--.

10:00.626 --> 10:02.334
Oh sh--, bro.

10:02.334 --> 10:04.334
Marcos has taken a big
chunk out of his head.

10:04.334 --> 10:05.375
What?

10:05.375 --> 10:11.000
He's taken the top of
his ----ing scalp off.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.792
Did you just call
my wife a bitch?

10:12.792 --> 10:13.834
-No.
-You sure?

10:13.834 --> 10:15.792
Yeah.

10:15.792 --> 10:17.792
I will [bleep] your world up.

10:17.792 --> 10:19.334
-Oh, dear God.
-Whatever.

10:19.334 --> 10:22.834
Mm-hmm.

10:22.834 --> 10:24.042
Yeah.

10:24.042 --> 10:25.584
Can we get anyone
anything to drink?

10:25.584 --> 10:27.167
-I'm fine.
-You good?

10:27.167 --> 10:29.751
Everyone's good?

10:29.751 --> 10:31.000
I don't wanna get
involved in that.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.375
And I don't either.

10:32.375 --> 10:34.125
-Are you sure, you don't?
-No, I think...

10:34.125 --> 10:35.959
I think I'll stay out
of this one.

10:35.959 --> 10:38.751
Take me with you!

10:38.751 --> 10:43.792
I don't know what happened.

10:43.792 --> 10:44.959
-We weren't...
-But hold on... hold on...

10:44.959 --> 10:46.542
we didn't say anything.

10:46.542 --> 10:48.250
He starts telling her about
if you're in New York

10:48.250 --> 10:49.542
and you don't like the water,

10:49.542 --> 10:51.209
you can just bitch
and bitch and bitch

10:51.209 --> 10:53.709
and they'll give
you what you want.

10:53.709 --> 10:55.209
And I said,
"No, if you're in New York,

10:55.209 --> 10:56.626
-they'll hit you in the face."
-Okay.

10:56.626 --> 10:58.584
And he got pissed off
and walked off.

10:58.584 --> 10:59.834
I mean, your husband
likes to have a lot of problems

10:59.834 --> 11:00.959
-with people..
-He does.

11:00.959 --> 11:02.250
But will you promise me

11:02.250 --> 11:03.667
you won't let it
come between you and me?

11:03.667 --> 11:04.959
I don't want drama.

11:04.959 --> 11:06.250
My friends were
fighting last charter,

11:06.250 --> 11:07.584
and it was, like,
not fun for me.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.792
I mean, I would much
rather the guests

11:09.792 --> 11:12.501
be arguing than
complaining about the food.

11:12.501 --> 11:15.959
I wouldn't be surprised if Rhett
kicked the sh-- out of him.

11:15.959 --> 11:17.834
It would be a favor to us all.

11:17.834 --> 11:19.959
I'm my own person, and you know
I can't control him, I can't.

11:19.959 --> 11:22.375
I feel sorry for you.

11:22.375 --> 11:28.250
So, I hope you guys realize
I do not control him.

11:28.250 --> 11:29.542
Are you trying
to clean that sofa?

11:29.542 --> 11:30.792
Yeah.

11:30.792 --> 11:33.125
Get that carpet cleaner, just
try it without any chemical.

11:33.125 --> 11:40.000
Okay.
All right, Glenn.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.918
I'm gonna give this a whirl
and see what happens.

11:43.918 --> 11:49.000
Just do just that.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.292
No, it's not doing anything.

11:50.292 --> 11:51.834
Never mind, never mind.

11:51.834 --> 11:53.709
It's not doing anything.

11:53.709 --> 11:54.918
Not good.

11:54.918 --> 11:57.042
One little patch with K2R and
see if that does anything.

11:57.042 --> 11:58.459
Okay.

11:58.459 --> 11:59.709
The guests are ready
to be picked up.

11:59.709 --> 12:01.083
Copy, on my way.

12:01.083 --> 12:04.709
Oh, God...
oh, my God, Mom.

12:04.709 --> 12:06.626
I hope you didn't ruin
my phone.

12:06.626 --> 12:08.125
Sh--.

12:08.125 --> 12:10.959
I have to wait,
I can't prepare anything.

12:10.959 --> 12:13.083
Yeah, you've gotta see
what they ----ing want.

12:13.083 --> 12:14.417
Because apparently,
whatever you make

12:14.417 --> 12:15.834
isn't what they want right now.

12:15.834 --> 12:17.417
Mm-hmm.

12:17.417 --> 12:18.709
Let that dry and sit
for a while,

12:18.709 --> 12:20.125
and then later we'll try
to suck if off

12:20.125 --> 12:21.792
with that and
see what happens.

12:21.792 --> 12:23.000
Will you take this off and
then we're giving it to Daisy.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.334
Absolutely.

12:24.334 --> 12:25.334
Because I actually
brought it for her.

12:25.334 --> 12:26.709
That was very kind of you.

12:26.709 --> 12:28.167
-You wanna put it on me.
-Put it on her, yeah.

12:28.167 --> 12:29.375
-No problem.
-Isn't that cute?

12:29.375 --> 12:30.959
It'll be prettier
on you than me.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.542
Oh, gosh.

12:32.542 --> 12:34.167
Oh my God...

12:34.167 --> 12:37.334
Oh, thank you, it's very sweet.

12:37.334 --> 12:39.584
I've never
seen anything like it.

12:39.584 --> 12:41.584
Do you want it under your
collar, and then that way...

12:41.584 --> 12:44.292
Whatever looks best,
I trust you.

12:44.292 --> 12:45.959
Gary told me there's been drama.

12:45.959 --> 12:47.375
Oh, there's been beef.

12:47.375 --> 12:48.959
-Thank you.
-Lovely.

12:48.959 --> 12:50.959
To be honest with you,
I don't know. I miss all...

12:50.959 --> 12:54.709
everything seems to happen and
I just seem to miss all of it.

12:54.709 --> 12:56.334
That makes two of us, Tom.

12:56.334 --> 13:00.876
It's probably best that way.

13:00.876 --> 13:03.334
-Welcome back, everybody.
-Thank you.

13:03.334 --> 13:04.959
I'm going straight back
to pick them up, yeah.

13:04.959 --> 13:06.167
-How you doing, Dais?
-Good.

13:06.167 --> 13:09.042
-I love your necklace.
-Thanks.

13:09.042 --> 13:10.542
Ooh, what happened to the couch?

13:10.542 --> 13:18.459
-Wasn't me.
-It wasn't me.

13:18.459 --> 13:23.667
No, don't worry, it's okay.

13:23.667 --> 13:24.751
No, no.

13:24.751 --> 13:26.292
They said they were
really happy with the food,

13:26.292 --> 13:27.959
but do you think
you could come up

13:27.959 --> 13:29.501
and speak to Cindi and Charles?

13:29.501 --> 13:31.584
Maybe, Daisy, you and I go too.

13:31.584 --> 13:32.667
Yeah, coming.

13:32.667 --> 13:34.876
It is hot out here, man.

13:34.876 --> 13:36.042
Hola, hola.

13:36.042 --> 13:42.167
-Hi... hola, como esta?
-Bien, bien.

13:42.167 --> 13:43.501
Hi, it's just me.

13:43.501 --> 13:44.959
I'm just wondering
if Charles wants to come

13:44.959 --> 13:47.459
and speak to the chef?

13:47.459 --> 13:49.792
Yeah, of course. He's up
there talking to your mom.

13:49.792 --> 13:51.000
So, if you wanna come up...

13:51.000 --> 13:52.375
Let's get Charles up here too,

13:52.375 --> 13:53.709
so you're speaking
directly to him.

13:53.709 --> 13:55.167
Yeah, yeah, that would be nice.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.167
Yeah, is he...
do you know if he's around?

13:56.167 --> 13:57.876
Sorry, excuse me...

13:57.876 --> 14:00.167
Erica's gonna come up and
speak for Charles, and she's...

14:00.167 --> 14:01.792
Oh, okay, perfect.

14:01.792 --> 14:03.542
His wife was telling us earlier,

14:03.542 --> 14:05.792
she's like, "I'm just so sorry,
I can't control him."

14:05.792 --> 14:07.417
She goes, "His hobby on
the weekends, he likes going

14:07.417 --> 14:08.876
to hotels and ordering food,

14:08.876 --> 14:10.709
and he bitches so he gets
all his food for free."

14:10.709 --> 14:16.876
He wants a big, fat,
filet, basically.

14:16.876 --> 14:21.459
-I would go for that.
-Yeah.

14:21.459 --> 14:23.167
Dude, I swear to God,
Charlie's the biggest

14:23.167 --> 14:25.042
----ing douchebag
you've ever met, dude.

14:25.042 --> 14:26.751
My husband loves
mashed potatoes,

14:26.751 --> 14:27.792
or he loves creamed spinach.

14:27.792 --> 14:29.709
I need to take notes.

14:29.709 --> 14:31.959
Oh, my God.

14:31.959 --> 14:33.959
This is the most
nasty menu combination

14:33.959 --> 14:35.584
I ever made in my life

14:35.584 --> 14:37.292
-We're happy?
-We're happy.

14:37.292 --> 14:38.834
-We're excited.
-Okay, great.

14:38.834 --> 14:40.459
She's, like, making nonsense.

14:40.459 --> 14:43.459
-Grazie here, gracias otherwise.
-Prego.

14:43.459 --> 14:44.667
Thank you.

14:44.667 --> 14:46.167
-You're welcome. All right.
-You're welcome, guys.

14:46.167 --> 14:50.584
Mucho bueno.

14:50.584 --> 14:53.792
Just a reminder
that Gary and Glenn

14:53.792 --> 14:57.375
are sitting at dinner with them.

14:57.375 --> 14:58.542
-Oh, really?
-Okay.

14:58.542 --> 15:00.125
-Yeah.
-That'd be great.

15:00.125 --> 15:01.584
We love Gary.

15:01.584 --> 15:03.292
They want me to join them
for dinner tomorrow night.

15:03.292 --> 15:05.167
Really?
They said that to me, too.

15:05.167 --> 15:06.459
Did they?

15:06.459 --> 15:07.876
Yeah gonna make heaps
of food, yeah.

15:07.876 --> 15:09.375
Yeah, just wanted to remind you.

15:09.375 --> 15:13.959
All right, let's bounce outta
this popsicle stand.

15:13.959 --> 15:15.876
Good work, team.

15:15.876 --> 15:18.918
Just a reminder,
it's decades theme party.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.876
For dinner they wanna
celebrate each decade.

15:20.876 --> 15:25.083
Don't forget the other two
extra people, Glenn and Gary.

15:25.083 --> 15:26.501
Oh, wow, this is a lot
of sh--, eh?

15:26.501 --> 15:28.584
It's a hell of a lot of sh--.

15:28.584 --> 15:30.459
Can you just help me
with the bar first?

15:30.459 --> 15:35.417
It's just that they can see it,
and it looks like a disaster.

15:35.417 --> 15:37.083
Do you think I'm allowed
lie down for 10 minutes?

15:37.083 --> 15:38.501
I ----ing hope so.

15:38.501 --> 15:40.876
My mom, Halhe,
and Susan are being fun.

15:40.876 --> 15:45.125
Oh, yeah...

15:45.125 --> 15:49.375
She's in a skanky-ass
mood, being rude.

15:49.375 --> 15:59.000
Thank you.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.417
Oh, Jesus.

16:00.417 --> 16:05.167
[bleep]

16:05.167 --> 16:06.626
One of those days?

16:06.626 --> 16:08.626
You don't need me to
help you unpack the bar,

16:08.626 --> 16:11.751
and let me tackle this
----ing mountain of dishes.

16:11.751 --> 16:13.876
Right now you don't
receiving help, or what?

16:13.876 --> 16:17.042
I haven't seen or
touched the laundry once.

16:17.042 --> 16:18.584
Well, you have to say something.

16:18.584 --> 16:20.000
I know, I know, I will.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.876
I just wanna not, like,
make accusations

16:21.876 --> 16:25.792
before I, like, make
sure I'm right about things.

16:25.792 --> 16:27.000
Are you guys all right?

16:27.000 --> 16:28.375
I can hear you guys
from the bar.

16:28.375 --> 16:32.167
-Oh, okay.
-Yeah.

16:32.167 --> 16:33.417
Don't you guys look glamorous?

16:33.417 --> 16:35.083
-Do we?
-Thank you.

16:35.083 --> 16:37.209
Would you like us to go for a
sail and then come back here?

16:37.209 --> 16:38.834
Yeah, I think that
would be nice.

16:38.834 --> 16:41.334
-Does sailing sound good?
-Yeah, that would be so cute.

16:41.334 --> 16:47.626
Taking a little nap?
-Are you coming to join?

16:47.626 --> 16:49.626
Stop!

16:49.626 --> 16:52.375
Hand above the covers.

16:52.375 --> 16:54.292
Hands above the covers, yeah.

16:54.292 --> 16:56.542
Ashley is obviously
not interested in me,

16:56.542 --> 16:59.417
because she's so interested
in talking with Gary.

16:59.417 --> 17:02.292
Stop touching me... ooh... back
massage. Okay, you can touch me.

17:02.292 --> 17:04.501
Some girls like this
Tarzan thing, I don't know.

17:04.501 --> 17:06.417
Everyone's looking at us
and walking away.

17:06.417 --> 17:08.959
-I'm not even doing anything.
-No, no, not yet.

17:08.959 --> 17:10.959
Show me your hands.

17:10.959 --> 17:13.167
No, can't help it,
I can't take my hand off my...

17:13.167 --> 17:14.876
I'm just kidding.

17:14.876 --> 17:17.167
All crew, all crew,
let's get everybody

17:17.167 --> 17:18.584
up on the flybridge who's free,

17:18.584 --> 17:20.876
let's start getting ready
to get sails up.

17:20.876 --> 17:23.417
Yeah, copy that.

17:23.417 --> 17:27.417
We're gonna go sideways,
we're gonna go sideways.

17:27.417 --> 17:30.000
And now I have, like,
a race against the sails.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.709
Boy, this is gonna feel good.

17:31.709 --> 17:32.792
Sriracha mayo.

17:32.792 --> 17:34.167
-Anchor's home.
-Copy.

17:34.167 --> 17:35.584
Okay, Tom, you wanna come
up to the flybridge?

17:35.584 --> 17:37.167
We're gonna do the mizzen.
-Okie-doke.

17:37.167 --> 17:43.042
Okay, I'm going up.

17:43.042 --> 17:44.584
Two wraps.

17:44.584 --> 17:46.375
Good, let's go straight
on to the main, Tom.

17:46.375 --> 17:49.375
Look at me,
----ing sailor boy.

17:49.375 --> 17:50.792
Oh, wow.

17:50.792 --> 17:53.167
And the genoa.

17:53.167 --> 17:54.375
Okay, that's main engine off.

17:54.375 --> 17:58.000
Ah!

17:58.000 --> 18:00.083
-Ah!
-Ah!

18:00.083 --> 18:02.209
Jeez.

18:02.209 --> 18:04.667
That's ----ing cool, no.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.209
[bleep]

18:06.209 --> 18:07.751
How the [bleep] does
this thing lock?

18:07.751 --> 18:11.584
Oh [bleep].

18:11.584 --> 18:14.417
Man, this is a very overrated
experience in front over here.

18:14.417 --> 18:16.584
Last time it was very majestic.

18:16.584 --> 18:18.250
Oh, Lord.

18:18.250 --> 18:19.417
No, if you wanna
know what majestic is,

18:19.417 --> 18:21.167
majestic is our kitty.

18:21.167 --> 18:23.125
Yeah, our cat is really cute.

18:23.125 --> 18:24.292
Ow!

18:24.292 --> 18:25.501
Ah sh--, I cut my head.

18:25.501 --> 18:26.709
-Oh sh--.
-Wait, wait, sit...

18:26.709 --> 18:28.167
Just sit there.

18:28.167 --> 18:35.876
Okay.
Oh, God.

18:35.876 --> 18:47.334
Ah [bleep].

18:47.334 --> 18:49.209
Marcos hit his head really bad,

18:49.209 --> 18:50.417
and I don't really know
what to do.

18:50.417 --> 18:57.667
He's cut his head really bad.

18:57.667 --> 18:58.834
Oh, sh--, bro.

18:58.834 --> 19:01.959
Oh, my God.

19:01.959 --> 19:05.083
Mm, [bleep].

19:05.083 --> 19:18.083
Oh sh--.

19:18.083 --> 19:21.792
Oh, my God.

19:21.792 --> 19:23.250
Ah sh--.

19:23.250 --> 19:24.792
I don't even really know
what to begin doing.

19:24.792 --> 19:27.000
Just patch it up,
patch it up.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.334
Probably in shock...

19:28.334 --> 19:29.918
do you need water,
a glass of water?

19:29.918 --> 19:31.209
Ah.

19:31.209 --> 19:32.959
Marcos has taken
a big chunk out of his head.

19:32.959 --> 19:34.375
What?

19:34.375 --> 19:35.584
It's about a patch of skin,
that much...

19:35.584 --> 19:36.501
On what?

19:36.501 --> 19:39.792
And he scalped himself
inside the fridge.

19:39.792 --> 19:41.375
I'll watch up here.

19:41.375 --> 19:42.918
How you doing, mate, you okay?

19:42.918 --> 19:44.250
Good, yeah.
I'm good.

19:44.250 --> 19:45.417
Okay.
Let's put something...

19:45.417 --> 19:46.792
-Gauze.
-Does it hurt?

19:46.792 --> 19:48.918
No, it's not that bad.

19:48.918 --> 19:50.584
Okay. Let me get
your face here.

19:50.584 --> 19:53.083
Just keep the pressure on it
so it'll help stop the bleeding.

19:53.083 --> 19:54.501
Mm-hmm.

19:54.501 --> 19:55.918
We're gonna have to
get you to see somebody,

19:55.918 --> 19:57.626
because he's taken
the scalp off of it.

19:57.626 --> 19:58.918
Yeah.

19:58.918 --> 20:00.042
-So, it's...
-Yeah.

20:00.042 --> 20:02.417
My first thought is
that this is

20:02.417 --> 20:04.000
the end of
the season for Marcos.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.834
It's that serious.

20:05.834 --> 20:08.501
Oh, man.

20:08.501 --> 20:10.167
You know, I'm not sure exactly
how to bandage that area,

20:10.167 --> 20:12.167
but we'll figure something out.

20:12.167 --> 20:13.834
In the meantime,
I'm gonna put the sails away,

20:13.834 --> 20:14.959
we're gonna start heading back.

20:14.959 --> 20:16.292
Sh--, sorry that
happened, dude.

20:16.292 --> 20:20.334
Do you wanna ice the area?

20:20.334 --> 20:21.667
Okay, let's fire up.

20:21.667 --> 20:24.876
Tom, can you keep an eye
on the sail going away?

20:24.876 --> 20:26.375
Okay.

20:26.375 --> 20:29.584
-Thanks, girl.
-Thank you, ma'am.

20:29.584 --> 20:30.876
Oh, my [bleep]...

20:30.876 --> 20:32.542
Stop.

20:32.542 --> 20:34.292
Okay, come on up here.
We're gonna do the mizzen now.

20:34.292 --> 20:38.667
Now it start hurting.

20:38.667 --> 20:41.334
-All right, hold.
-Okay. That's good enough.

20:41.334 --> 20:42.792
Okay, I'm gonna
go call the doctor.

20:42.792 --> 20:44.792
I'm gonna go continue
to pull for dinner.

20:44.792 --> 20:46.167
Thank you.

20:46.167 --> 20:48.501
Put some tape on the head,
----ing patch it up.

20:48.501 --> 20:50.667
But I have to make
that dinner happen.

20:50.667 --> 20:52.584
No time to puss it out.

20:52.584 --> 20:53.751
Hello?

20:53.751 --> 20:56.792
Yeah, it's Glenn calling
from the boat Parsifal III.

20:56.792 --> 21:00.584
I have one crewmember who was
reaching into a refrigerator,

21:00.584 --> 21:04.792
and he's kind of scalped, like,
a piece of scalp off his head.

21:04.792 --> 21:07.334
I mean, we've got a bandage
on it now,

21:07.334 --> 21:09.542
and pressure on it, but
I'm not really sure

21:09.542 --> 21:16.709
how to deal with
that type of wound.

21:16.709 --> 21:23.375
Thank you very, very much.

21:23.375 --> 21:24.709
-Stop...
-Oh, my God.

21:24.709 --> 21:26.542
-We smell good.
-You have to sleep with him.

21:26.542 --> 21:28.918
Where is the broccolis?
Where are the damn broccolis?

21:28.918 --> 21:31.000
Can you go hand over
and tell her

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
to go get changed,
please, thanks.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.417
Is it even 6:30 yet?

21:36.417 --> 21:39.709
We're safe to drop,
drop, drop, drop.

21:39.709 --> 21:41.751
Not right now,
I used Halhe's deodorant.

21:41.751 --> 21:48.125
Ugh!

21:48.125 --> 21:49.959
Well, hey, the first thing
I did when I met her,

21:49.959 --> 21:52.209
I smelled her butt like a dog.

21:52.209 --> 21:53.501
That was weird.

21:53.501 --> 21:54.876
Are we dressing up
for dinner, still?

21:54.876 --> 21:56.501
-Yeah.
-That's two at the waterline.

21:56.501 --> 21:58.542
That's main engine off.

21:58.542 --> 22:00.959
Dude, we have to have sex
at least once on the boat.

22:00.959 --> 22:02.375
Yeah, we'll be back.

22:02.375 --> 22:03.626
Yeah, we need 20 minutes,
we'll be back.

22:03.626 --> 22:05.375
It should only take five,
actually.

22:05.375 --> 22:08.626
So, Ashley's gonna do
service with you tonight.

22:08.626 --> 22:10.083
No, I do, I just
thought we were gonna

22:10.083 --> 22:13.250
switch every other charter.

22:13.250 --> 22:15.375
But I want you both, like,
so the guests

22:15.375 --> 22:17.167
-can see you both during...
-See both of us? Okay.

22:17.167 --> 22:18.584
Yeah, but she'll do lates.

22:18.584 --> 22:19.876
Okay, cool.

22:19.876 --> 22:20.876
-Hello.
-Hi!

22:20.876 --> 22:23.000
Glenn, Glenn, Tom.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.667
The doctor is aboard
to see Marcos.

22:24.667 --> 22:26.125
-Hi, Glenn.
-Hi, how are you?

22:26.125 --> 22:27.542
Good, how about yourself?

22:27.542 --> 22:28.918
I'll give you one of those...
very good.

22:28.918 --> 22:31.375
You think my hair is gonna grow?

22:31.375 --> 22:32.959
-I don't know.
-Don't laugh.

22:32.959 --> 22:35.501
Well, I don't know, do I
look like someone who knows?

22:35.501 --> 22:37.375
Thanks for coming out on
such short notice.

22:37.375 --> 22:38.542
Always.

22:38.542 --> 22:40.083
-She's got... this is Dr. Tea.
-How are you doing?

22:40.083 --> 22:41.375
I improvised.

22:41.375 --> 22:42.792
-I'm Tea, nice to meet you.
-Tea.

22:42.792 --> 22:50.250
Do you wanna take a seat here?

22:50.250 --> 22:51.751
No, don't move, don't move,
don't move.

22:51.751 --> 22:54.751
Well, yeah, of course.

22:54.751 --> 23:01.501
It is a big piece, but
it's very, very superficial.

23:01.501 --> 23:03.501
You do not, but it would be
good if you can do...

23:03.501 --> 23:07.167
you can change it on your own.

23:07.167 --> 23:08.459
How does it feel, is it hurting?

23:08.459 --> 23:09.542
-Dinner's gonna be on time.
-Yeah.

23:09.542 --> 23:11.584
My head ----ing hurts so much,

23:11.584 --> 23:14.792
but these guests don't care if
I cut my head or not, whatever.

23:14.792 --> 23:18.125
They want their food on the
table, so, I can't stop cooking.

23:18.125 --> 23:19.334
See you later, keep in touch.

23:19.334 --> 23:21.167
I will walk you out, thank you.

23:21.167 --> 23:22.584
I'm not going in there yet.

23:22.584 --> 23:24.000
I'm gonna give them
five more minutes.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.709
[laughing]

23:25.709 --> 23:27.834
-I'll wait for my drink.
-Oh, my God.

23:27.834 --> 23:35.918
Oh, my God.

23:35.918 --> 23:37.584
-Oh, okay.
-[bleep]

23:37.584 --> 23:38.918
How do you feel?

23:38.918 --> 23:51.959
Yeah, I feel good.

23:51.959 --> 23:53.918
Erica, I'm not gonna wear
a thousand dollar

23:53.918 --> 23:55.751
Neiman Marcus shirt right now.

23:55.751 --> 23:56.751
Mom, you look really cool.

23:56.751 --> 23:58.209
Thank you.

23:58.209 --> 23:59.959
-Who would have hairspray?
-I don't know, babe.

23:59.959 --> 24:00.959
Don't yell at me.

24:00.959 --> 24:01.959
Get the [bleep] out.

24:01.959 --> 24:03.375
I need hairspray for my hair,

24:03.375 --> 24:04.375
just like everybody else
need stuff for theirs.

24:04.375 --> 24:05.876
Then hop out and go look for it.

24:05.876 --> 24:07.501
I don't know where it is,
it's here.

24:07.501 --> 24:09.209
I said hop out of our room
and go look for it.

24:09.209 --> 24:10.751
-I'm trying to get ready.
-I am, too.

24:10.751 --> 24:12.918
-We're eating with them tonight.
-Yeah, we are.

24:12.918 --> 24:14.209
-Stop eating.
-I know.

24:14.209 --> 24:15.250
Do we know what time dinner is?

24:15.250 --> 24:16.876
-Eight.
-You excited for dinner?

24:16.876 --> 24:18.918
You and I should just sit
at the little round table,

24:18.918 --> 24:20.083
and they can sit at the back.

24:20.083 --> 24:21.834
-We'll talk golf.
-Yeah.

24:21.834 --> 24:23.959
These aren't my first choice
of people to have dinner with,

24:23.959 --> 24:25.959
but, you know, I guess
to eat Marcos' food,

24:25.959 --> 24:27.959
and it keeps me out of
the galley doing dishes...

24:27.959 --> 24:29.584
score!

24:29.584 --> 24:31.000
-I'm gonna go take a shower.
-What are you wearing?

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
-Probably my birthday suit.
-Sexy.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.834
Wow!

24:36.834 --> 24:37.959
Who are you?

24:37.959 --> 24:41.501
We have a new guest on board.

24:41.501 --> 24:42.834
Gorgeous.

24:42.834 --> 24:44.083
Oh!

24:44.083 --> 24:47.918
Oh, you look fab, Cindi,
I love it.

24:47.918 --> 24:49.417
Champagne in the bathtub.

24:49.417 --> 24:54.792
Maybe we can put
it in the hot tub.

24:54.792 --> 25:03.459
Wow.

25:03.459 --> 25:05.751
-What else have we got?
-Thanks for your help, Tom.

25:05.751 --> 25:06.584
Is that it?

25:06.584 --> 25:08.501
Wear these wigs
for dinner service.

25:08.501 --> 25:10.876
Yeah.

25:10.876 --> 25:13.667
Would you like to make
your way to our lovely table?

25:13.667 --> 25:14.667
Yeah.

25:14.667 --> 25:16.167
Don't you wish, when you
do stuff like that,

25:16.167 --> 25:17.751
like you've done with your head,

25:17.751 --> 25:19.751
you just wanna go back in
time, like ----ing one hour,

25:19.751 --> 25:21.083
and just not do that?

25:21.083 --> 25:22.918
I wish we can do that.

25:22.918 --> 25:26.918
They're all about to sit down.

25:26.918 --> 25:28.083
Yours, too

25:28.083 --> 25:30.959
-Wow!
-Hey!

25:30.959 --> 25:33.417
You guys look amazing.

25:33.417 --> 25:35.125
Everyone is sitting,
including the captain?

25:35.125 --> 25:36.792
Everyone's sitting, yeah.

25:36.792 --> 25:37.876
You can start.

25:37.876 --> 25:39.292
So, tuna tartare.

25:39.292 --> 25:41.167
I think I'm the only
single one of the group.

25:41.167 --> 25:42.584
-You are.
-Oh, really!

25:42.584 --> 25:45.167
-[laughing]
-I'm single.

25:45.167 --> 25:46.667
And here we have tuna tartare.

25:46.667 --> 25:47.751
Oh, yes.

25:47.751 --> 25:49.167
That looks so frigging good,
you guys, I mean it.

25:49.167 --> 25:50.667
-Cream of spinach.
-Yum!

25:50.667 --> 25:51.542
That's for Chuck.

25:51.542 --> 25:53.250
Oh, wow, is that what
I think it is?

25:53.250 --> 25:55.083
-Spaghetti marinara.
-Mm!

25:55.083 --> 25:56.375
Yummy!

25:56.375 --> 25:57.375
It's like all of
our favorite stuff.

25:57.375 --> 26:03.959
Peruvian salmon sashimi.

26:03.959 --> 26:07.667
There's none, restaurant.

26:07.667 --> 26:10.375
-Miso broccoli ginger.
-Miso broccoli.

26:10.375 --> 26:11.792
These kind of crazy buffets,

26:11.792 --> 26:14.751
they just throw out
a bunch of food, you know,

26:14.751 --> 26:16.918
like, all you can eat, until
you ----ing die, you know?

26:16.918 --> 26:22.000
Here we have rib eye steak with
broccoli, miso, and ginger.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.876
I eat pretty much everything.

26:23.876 --> 26:25.000
That's what I've heard.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
[laughing]

26:26.000 --> 26:27.751
Mm!

26:27.751 --> 26:32.584
I'm glad we passed the test of
not being mean girls this year.

26:32.584 --> 26:34.250
-We are easygoing.
-You guys make a nice couple.

26:34.250 --> 26:35.751
Thank you, we appreciate it.

26:35.751 --> 26:36.959
We've known each other
since high school.

26:36.959 --> 26:37.959
Really?

26:37.959 --> 26:39.751
Erica came up with our nickname,

26:39.751 --> 26:41.417
and I'm Charles and she's
Erica, so she came with Cherica.

26:41.417 --> 26:48.209
-Yes.
-Oh, that's a good one.

26:48.209 --> 26:49.375
Want me to get out,
or you're gonna climb over?

26:49.375 --> 26:50.751
No, I'll just climb over.

26:50.751 --> 26:52.042
-Sh--!
-Ooh!

26:52.042 --> 26:53.042
-Whoa, be careful.
-Yes, I'm fine.

26:53.042 --> 26:54.209
-Ow!
-Oh, girl.

26:54.209 --> 26:56.167
-You all right?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

26:56.167 --> 26:57.250
Everyone is eating everything?

26:57.250 --> 26:58.751
-Yeah.
-What about the salmon?

26:58.751 --> 27:00.626
No, they're definitely
eating the salmon.

27:00.626 --> 27:02.626
Their grandma didn't say...
heh, grandma.

27:02.626 --> 27:07.584
She doesn't know what
----ing planet she's on.

27:07.584 --> 27:09.792
I'm not sure they have too much
of an issue with bitching.

27:09.792 --> 27:11.167
-Babe?
-Yeah?

27:11.167 --> 27:13.292
-What are you doing?
-Just taking a break.

27:13.292 --> 27:14.959
What's wrong?

27:14.959 --> 27:16.918
I don't have to deal with him,
and I'm not going to.

27:16.918 --> 27:18.375
You don't have to ----ing talk
to him again when we get home,

27:18.375 --> 27:19.751
so who gives a sh--?

27:19.751 --> 27:21.459
Cindi, you look fabulous.

27:21.459 --> 27:24.167
When I look at you, I feel like
I'm looking at Marilyn Monroe.

27:24.167 --> 27:26.542
-Yeah.
-Oh, yes.

27:26.542 --> 27:28.042
She kinda looks like her,
a little bit.

27:28.042 --> 27:30.584
[chattering]

27:30.584 --> 27:32.375
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Woo!

27:32.375 --> 27:33.918
Oh, now I'm in trouble.

27:33.918 --> 27:35.375
[bleep]

27:35.375 --> 27:39.042
So, I'm JFK and you're
Marilyn, all right.

27:39.042 --> 27:43.834
â™ª Happy birthday to you

27:43.834 --> 27:48.876
â™ª Happy birthday, Mr. Captain

27:48.876 --> 27:54.083
â™ª Happy birthday to you

27:54.083 --> 27:57.751
Oh, my God.

27:57.751 --> 28:00.250
Is Glenn the life
of the party, or what?

28:00.250 --> 28:04.209
May you live 100 years.

28:04.209 --> 28:10.959
May you go on
a hundred cruises.

28:10.959 --> 28:14.334
May your dreams come true.

28:14.334 --> 28:15.959
Wow.
I've got to take notes.

28:15.959 --> 28:18.000
[laughing]

28:18.000 --> 28:21.334
-Happy birthday to you.
-Woo!

28:21.334 --> 28:23.042
Thank you, thank you so much.

28:23.042 --> 28:24.334
-Yay!
-Woo!

28:24.334 --> 28:24.334
-That was amazing.
-Wow.

28:24.334 --> 28:30.834
Did you just call
my wife a bitch?

28:30.834 --> 28:32.584
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

28:32.584 --> 28:34.167
-Here's to you guys.
-L'chaim!

28:34.167 --> 28:35.542
Salud.

28:35.542 --> 28:37.792
Thank you for a fantastic meal.

28:37.792 --> 28:39.209
Mission accomplished.

28:39.209 --> 28:43.083
What a ----ing day, no?

28:43.083 --> 28:44.584
Good night.

28:44.584 --> 28:48.792
Thank you, everybody.
Thanks for joining us on our...

28:48.792 --> 28:50.959
She can have the room
to herself.

28:50.959 --> 28:52.334
Me and my wife,
we did our thing

28:52.334 --> 28:53.375
for 10 minutes earlier,
we're good.

28:53.375 --> 28:55.501
Ten minutes?

28:55.501 --> 28:59.209
Breakfast stuff is
already pulled, pretty much.

28:59.209 --> 29:00.667
-Yeah.
-That's pretty much it.

29:00.667 --> 29:01.792
-Yeah.
-I'll see you in the morning.

29:01.792 --> 29:03.709
-Good night.
-See you in the morning.

29:03.709 --> 29:04.626
Going to bed.

29:04.626 --> 29:07.042
-How you doing?
-Good, how was everything?

29:07.042 --> 29:09.167
Dude, it was delicious.

29:09.167 --> 29:11.375
Hi, I'm so tired.

29:11.375 --> 29:13.459
-The food was good.
-My head is killing me.

29:13.459 --> 29:32.125
-Yeah, just take that off.
-Yeah.

29:32.125 --> 29:34.542
Good morning, sunshine.

29:34.542 --> 29:39.667
Ah.

29:39.667 --> 29:43.083
Mm!

29:43.083 --> 29:44.417
...so it's not one
over the other.

29:44.417 --> 29:45.792
You're telling a
stew how to do...

29:45.792 --> 29:46.709
make pillows look nicely.

29:46.709 --> 29:50.250
I am telling you how
to make my pillows.

29:50.250 --> 29:52.250
Time to get up.

29:52.250 --> 29:54.459
Did you see any
fresh-squeezed orange juice?

29:54.459 --> 29:57.209
I don't see any,
I don't think they did it.

29:57.209 --> 30:00.542
-Oh. Okay.
-They should.

30:00.542 --> 30:04.959
No, there's a little bit
left over from yesterday.

30:04.959 --> 30:12.584
[speaking Spanish]

30:12.584 --> 30:14.459
I don't wanna look like I'm...

30:14.459 --> 30:16.959
-No, no.
-Like, I really can't...

30:16.959 --> 30:19.167
I can't.
Like, I can't.

30:19.167 --> 30:20.375
I just can't.

30:20.375 --> 30:22.042
You guys should have
a meeting after.

30:22.042 --> 30:26.375
-We will.
-Yeah.

30:26.375 --> 30:28.751
Put this upstairs, please.

30:28.751 --> 30:32.751
We have some Spanish sausage,
assortment of cheeses.

30:32.751 --> 30:38.584
Morning.

30:38.584 --> 30:39.792
-Did it?
-Yeah.

30:39.792 --> 30:41.334
It was really hard
to sleep last night.

30:41.334 --> 30:43.959
My head is pounding.
It's painful.

30:43.959 --> 30:46.000
I just don't tell anybody.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.542
You wanna see?

30:47.542 --> 30:48.709
[laughing]

30:48.709 --> 30:49.959
Gross.

30:49.959 --> 30:51.959
Deck, deck, deck, Glenn.

30:51.959 --> 30:53.250
Yeah, Glenn, go ahead.

30:53.250 --> 30:54.959
Are you guys okay
if we fire up?

30:54.959 --> 31:10.792
Yeah, you're welcome to fire
up and start picking up.

31:10.792 --> 31:15.167
Okay, we are ready
to rock and roll.

31:15.167 --> 31:17.042
[yawning]

31:17.042 --> 31:21.042
-Morning.
-Hi!

31:21.042 --> 31:33.125
Never in a million years.

31:33.125 --> 31:42.959
Me, too.

31:42.959 --> 31:44.375
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

31:44.375 --> 31:45.751
Forward running spring first?

31:45.751 --> 31:47.751
Okay.

31:47.751 --> 31:50.959
Help make sure the fenders
land on those big bumpers.

31:50.959 --> 31:53.083
Can I show you, so
we'll take up all the slack.

31:53.083 --> 31:55.167
Okay, so we'll go around one.

31:55.167 --> 31:57.792
-All ready?
-Yeah.

31:57.792 --> 31:59.125
Beautiful.

31:59.125 --> 32:00.876
I've thrown a line
or two in my day.

32:00.876 --> 32:02.626
Okay, guys,
I'm gonna come out of here.

32:02.626 --> 32:05.209
Okay, that's main engine off,
main engine off.

32:05.209 --> 32:07.417
You need to sit down
later with the girls.

32:07.417 --> 32:11.834
Why?

32:11.834 --> 32:13.459
What, they're bitching about me,
or they're bitching...

32:13.459 --> 32:15.375
-No. In between them.
-Yeah.

32:15.375 --> 32:17.959
There's too many ----ing
egos with those two girls.

32:17.959 --> 32:21.792
Honestly, I have so much other
----ing bullsh-- to deal with.

32:21.792 --> 32:23.334
Ugh.

32:23.334 --> 32:25.959
I just wanted to talk
to you about one thing.

32:25.959 --> 32:27.584
Did I do something wrong?

32:27.584 --> 32:31.334
No, but one of the guests had
bronzer on and sat down with it.

32:31.334 --> 32:32.876
Okay.
Yeah.

32:32.876 --> 32:34.375
Tried to clean it;
we weren't able to clean it.

32:34.375 --> 32:37.792
I wasn't really
sitting on the couch.

32:37.792 --> 32:39.250
But it's there,
and a little bit there.

32:39.250 --> 32:42.751
When a primary charters a boat,

32:42.751 --> 32:45.250
they're responsible for
any significant damage

32:45.250 --> 32:46.751
done to the boat.

32:46.751 --> 32:49.918
Having that conversation before
they leave is never fun.

32:49.918 --> 32:52.626
It's always a little bit
awkward, but you have to do it.

32:52.626 --> 32:54.125
-I'll go through the broker...
-Yeah.

32:54.125 --> 32:56.167
But I just wanna make sure
that you are aware of it.

32:56.167 --> 32:57.584
-Cool.
-Yeah.

32:57.584 --> 32:59.834
You guys, we have a
little problem here.

32:59.834 --> 33:02.375
Somebody wore bronzer
and it got on the couch.

33:02.375 --> 33:03.959
Yeah, we all,
I think, saw that.

33:03.959 --> 33:05.751
So, we're gonna all
have to pay for it.

33:05.751 --> 33:12.167
-No, because we didn't do that.
-I didn't, either.

33:12.167 --> 33:14.667
-So, Daisy and I on the end.
-Yeah.

33:14.667 --> 33:16.375
Bye, guys.

33:16.375 --> 33:18.209
I wore my best dress.

33:18.209 --> 33:20.042
-Yeah.
-You get a hug.

33:20.042 --> 33:22.334
Yay!
Have a lovely trip back home.

33:22.334 --> 33:23.501
-Thank you.
-Marcos.

33:23.501 --> 33:24.959
Hey, man, pleasure
to meet you.

33:24.959 --> 33:26.292
Good to meet you, bro.

33:26.292 --> 33:27.501
-And I got you a rose.
-That was a total...

33:27.501 --> 33:28.375
Oh, really? Wow.

33:28.375 --> 33:30.709
-Yes.
-Bye, Cindi.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.209
-You were fabulous as always.
-Thank you.

33:32.209 --> 33:33.584
-Pleasure to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

33:33.584 --> 33:34.792
And this is for you.
I'm looking for...

33:34.792 --> 33:36.334
oh, thank you very much.

33:36.334 --> 33:37.334
And I'm gonna take care
of whatever the problem is.

33:37.334 --> 33:38.834
We'll figure it out.

33:38.834 --> 33:40.417
I don't care who did it,
I'll take care of it.

33:40.417 --> 33:41.542
We'll figure it out.
All right, mate...

33:41.542 --> 33:42.834
-Ah.
-Thanks for everything.

33:42.834 --> 33:44.167
I've never had so much
fun in my life.

33:44.167 --> 33:45.125
-Thank you very much.
-Bye.

33:45.125 --> 33:47.626
Bye, thank you.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.250
What are...
why are we waving?

33:49.250 --> 33:51.626
I don't know.

33:51.626 --> 33:53.667
Oh, man.

33:53.667 --> 33:57.292
[ship horn]

33:57.292 --> 33:58.626
Please, never come back

33:58.626 --> 34:00.834
-Woo-hoo!
-Charter number two!

34:00.834 --> 34:01.792
-Yes!
-We survived!

34:01.792 --> 34:05.042
Was that two or five?

34:05.042 --> 34:06.209
Okay.
Deck team, cushions.

34:06.209 --> 34:07.584
Then we can put the covers on.

34:07.584 --> 34:08.959
Girls, you know what
you're doing, yeah?

34:08.959 --> 34:12.083
Yeah.

34:12.083 --> 34:16.417
I don't think this is
my T-shirt, what do you think?

34:16.417 --> 34:17.959
All crew, all crew,

34:17.959 --> 34:21.083
can we get everybody together
for a tip meeting?

34:21.083 --> 34:23.334
Copy.

34:23.334 --> 34:28.167
I don't want champagne,
I want tequila.

34:28.167 --> 34:30.417
Well, that was really
interesting.

34:30.417 --> 34:32.667
Daisy, your team did
a really good job,

34:32.667 --> 34:35.709
everything seemed
to run smoothly.

34:35.709 --> 34:38.542
I think it's a testament
to your leadership skills

34:38.542 --> 34:43.000
and how you've brought
your team together.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.542
The girls did a great job.

34:44.542 --> 34:50.042
I do want to remind everyone
if there are issues,

34:50.042 --> 34:53.542
anyone can come and talk to me,
and to remember we're a team.

34:53.542 --> 34:54.375
Yes.

34:54.375 --> 34:57.959
And to work with
each other respectfully.

34:57.959 --> 34:59.334
-Okay.
-Just a reminder.

34:59.334 --> 35:01.751
Marcos, I think you accommodated
them very well,

35:01.751 --> 35:05.125
especially the fact that
you hurt your head really bad.

35:05.125 --> 35:06.292
-Yeah.
-But you...

35:06.292 --> 35:07.584
And I pulled off
the dinner, yeah.

35:07.584 --> 35:09.501
You still pulled out the dinner,
and I was there for the dinner.

35:09.501 --> 35:11.167
It seemed like
he enjoyed everything.

35:11.167 --> 35:12.751
Good. Okay.

35:12.751 --> 35:15.542
So, now to the tip.

35:15.542 --> 35:17.876
I don't personally feel
that this tip

35:17.876 --> 35:24.042
reflects the quality of service
that we gave these guys.

35:24.042 --> 35:26.042
You guys worked really hard,

35:26.042 --> 35:27.417
and you pulled out all the stops

35:27.417 --> 35:30.918
to make this the best
charter for them.

35:30.918 --> 35:35.125
For whatever reason, the tip
comes to a total of...

35:35.125 --> 35:39.000
$6,500.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.876
[bleep] my ----ing life.

35:40.876 --> 35:44.209
I honestly think I'm about
to burst into tears.

35:44.209 --> 35:53.834
I'm... I'm not okay right now.

35:53.834 --> 35:53.834
For whatever reason, the tip
comes to a total of

35:53.834 --> 35:57.876
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

35:57.876 --> 36:00.459
$6,500,

36:00.459 --> 36:02.792
which comes to 720 each.

36:02.792 --> 36:06.000
It's still better than a poke
in the eye with a pointy stick.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.375
They could have tipped us
30 grand, 40 grand, 50 grand.

36:08.375 --> 36:11.209
No money in the world
would make me happy

36:11.209 --> 36:12.918
to work for people like that.

36:12.918 --> 36:15.959
I just don't think people
like that deserve nice things.

36:15.959 --> 36:18.000
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
Thank you.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.501
As far as I'm concerned,

36:20.501 --> 36:22.334
they can take that tip and
shove it up their hole.

36:22.334 --> 36:25.709
I'd feel worse if I felt like
it was a tip we deserved.

36:25.709 --> 36:27.375
It's a reflection on them,
and you know,

36:27.375 --> 36:28.792
regardless of this tip,

36:28.792 --> 36:30.584
I think we had a
great start to a season.

36:30.584 --> 36:33.584
For tonight, you guys are gonna
go out and just have fun.

36:33.584 --> 36:34.918
Thanks, Dais. Okay, guys.

36:34.918 --> 36:36.334
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

36:36.334 --> 36:38.250
-Cheers, good job, everyone.
-Good job, exactly.

36:38.250 --> 36:40.584
-I'm gonna drink tonight.
-You deserve it.

36:40.584 --> 36:42.834
Rawr!

36:42.834 --> 36:45.792
Do you think we should just
wash all these ----ing cushions?

36:45.792 --> 36:50.167
That is yachting, literally...
do it again, every day.

36:50.167 --> 36:51.792
-Hey, ladies?
-Yeah?

36:51.792 --> 36:52.542
What?

36:52.542 --> 36:54.375
Come, girls.
Come, both of you.

36:54.375 --> 36:56.292
This bed's big enough
for all three of us.

36:56.292 --> 36:58.501
All right,
let's just get it outta the way.

36:58.501 --> 37:00.501
-Come on, Ashley.
-It's a threesome.

37:00.501 --> 37:03.167
-Oh, God.
-This blanket's too small.

37:03.167 --> 37:13.375
It's so small.

37:13.375 --> 37:15.959
You'd rather me be
in the middle?

37:15.959 --> 37:17.959
No ----ing way.

37:17.959 --> 37:19.959
Okay, no, seriously, this
is very uncomfortable, wow.

37:19.959 --> 37:21.375
-It is, that hurt.
-This thing does hurt.

37:21.375 --> 37:22.584
-I don't like it.
-Yeah. So...

37:22.584 --> 37:24.167
And I'm talking about the bed.

37:24.167 --> 37:25.542
So, we won't be
having sex on here.

37:25.542 --> 37:27.709
-Oh, is that open?
-Yeah.

37:27.709 --> 37:29.751
-Is it...
-Gummy bears.

37:29.751 --> 37:31.292
Perfect.

37:31.292 --> 37:33.125
What time to start
tomorrow, 10:00?

37:33.125 --> 37:36.042
I'm just gonna say 9:00 in my
mind so I don't drink too much.

37:36.042 --> 37:37.292
-Starting at 9:00.
-Okay.

37:37.292 --> 37:38.959
Okay, well,
I think that's us done.

37:38.959 --> 37:40.125
I guess we can chill now.

37:40.125 --> 37:41.792
Okay.
Oh, my legs are sore.

37:41.792 --> 37:42.542
[bleep]

37:42.542 --> 37:44.751
We're out.
We did our job.

37:44.751 --> 37:46.292
Are you guys not
getting along inside?

37:46.292 --> 37:50.501
No, I'm...
we're getting along...

37:50.501 --> 37:51.542
Huh.

37:51.542 --> 37:54.167
-Who's the second?
-Gabriela.

37:54.167 --> 37:55.584
That's still a thing?

37:55.584 --> 37:56.751
It...

37:56.751 --> 38:00.042
Yes, the titles are there,
and I have to respect her.

38:00.042 --> 38:01.542
Do you do different jobs?

38:01.542 --> 38:03.584
No, we're doing the same,
we're rotating.

38:03.584 --> 38:05.209
We're doing the same thing.

38:05.209 --> 38:06.959
It's, like, hashed out now,
but I have to respect her,

38:06.959 --> 38:08.584
because I'm third.

38:08.584 --> 38:10.834
Do you think you both should
have just been the same stews?

38:10.834 --> 38:12.334
Yeah, I do.

38:12.334 --> 38:14.501
I'm extremely competitive,
and I...

38:14.501 --> 38:15.834
You've got brothers and sisters?

38:15.834 --> 38:17.459
I have an older sister,
we're not close.

38:17.459 --> 38:19.959
I haven't spoken to my
sister in, like, a year.

38:19.959 --> 38:21.209
Claws out.

38:21.209 --> 38:22.209
Why haven't you
chatted to your sister?

38:22.209 --> 38:23.834
Long story?

38:23.834 --> 38:25.834
Like, she screwed every guy
I ever liked in high school.

38:25.834 --> 38:26.626
Really?

38:26.626 --> 38:29.375
Yeah, and she knew
I liked them.

38:29.375 --> 38:31.417
You know, I think when
it comes to girls,

38:31.417 --> 38:32.792
sometimes it's a me thing.

38:32.792 --> 38:35.834
I do have a few girlfriends
that are great,

38:35.834 --> 38:38.250
but it's a trust thing.

38:38.250 --> 38:39.584
Just, like, she would,
like [bleep] people

38:39.584 --> 38:42.375
-in my room, and, like...
-In your room?

38:42.375 --> 38:44.626
Yeah, like, and on my bed
and, like, brag,

38:44.626 --> 38:46.626
and like, rub it
in, like, hee, hee, hee.

38:46.626 --> 38:49.918
-Really?
-Yeah.

38:49.918 --> 38:51.876
Like, I... it's just...

38:51.876 --> 38:54.959
Like, I have been told
so many times

38:54.959 --> 38:56.209
that I come off as standoffish.

38:56.209 --> 38:57.709
I know I'm doing it,

38:57.709 --> 39:00.375
but it's hard for me
to not be the way I am.

39:00.375 --> 39:03.209
-Did you do the same to her?
-No.

39:03.209 --> 39:05.709
Girls are a little
tricky sometimes...

39:05.709 --> 39:07.000
just a little.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.751
It's interesting, everyone's
got a history, don't they?

39:10.751 --> 39:11.751
Yeah.

39:11.751 --> 39:14.334
What time is it?
I think I need to get dressed.

39:14.334 --> 39:15.959
Okay, which are
my lucky underwear?

39:15.959 --> 39:17.959
Because Gary wants to get lucky.

39:17.959 --> 39:19.501
I'm gonna get a beer.
You need something?

39:19.501 --> 39:20.834
I'm okay, thank you.

39:20.834 --> 39:23.083
[bangs]
Ah! Ah!

39:23.083 --> 39:24.083
-Ah!
-Oh!

39:24.083 --> 39:26.542
[laughing]

39:26.542 --> 39:30.209
Ow!

39:30.209 --> 39:32.501
Okay, papi!

39:32.501 --> 39:35.501
Yeah.

39:35.501 --> 39:37.959
You can have one cocktail.

39:37.959 --> 39:41.792
No, Daisy, I can't.

39:41.792 --> 39:44.042
-Yes!
-Woo!

39:44.042 --> 39:45.542
You look amazing.

39:45.542 --> 39:47.042
-Thank you, Daisy.
-Yeah, I know. Beside that...

39:47.042 --> 39:48.375
Ugh.

39:48.375 --> 39:49.959
I had a question for you, Dais.

39:49.959 --> 39:52.792
If your best friend's
life depended on it

39:52.792 --> 39:55.459
and you wanted to try to make
that stain a little bit better,

39:55.459 --> 39:56.792
what chemical would you use?

39:56.792 --> 39:59.083
Honestly, that Vanish
has been working.

39:59.083 --> 40:01.334
-It works miracles.
-Yeah.

40:01.334 --> 40:02.709
Can I see the Vanish?
I wanna try something.

40:02.709 --> 40:03.751
Yeah.

40:03.751 --> 40:06.125
Colin sure kinda looks
like he's still at work.

40:06.125 --> 40:08.083
I know, I was gonna
say that earlier.

40:08.083 --> 40:09.501
Hey, Dais, you look pretty.

40:09.501 --> 40:11.459
There's margarita
in the glass jar.

40:11.459 --> 40:12.626
Okay.

40:12.626 --> 40:14.959
We've got two extra crewmembers
in this photo, come on.

40:14.959 --> 40:16.334
This stuff is amazing.

40:16.334 --> 40:17.667
Where is that vacuum?

40:17.667 --> 40:20.709
Oh, my God, y'all look gorgeous!

40:20.709 --> 40:23.250
I've not stopped tapping,
I'm tapping away.

40:23.250 --> 40:30.083
This is how I teach
people to take my photos.

40:30.083 --> 40:34.459
I love Glenn, but [bleep] me, do
we really have to do this now?

40:34.459 --> 40:37.125
I mean, it looks a
thousand times better.

40:37.125 --> 40:40.751
Yeah, but we do have
that water stain.

40:40.751 --> 40:41.792
I need a ----ing drink.

40:41.792 --> 40:45.000
We're really far ahead
with the turnaround,

40:45.000 --> 40:46.417
so we'll look after it tomorrow.

40:46.417 --> 40:47.959
Thank you for helping.

40:47.959 --> 40:49.334
Yeah, my pleasure.

40:49.334 --> 40:50.918
Oh, my God. Whoa.

40:50.918 --> 40:52.792
Okay, kids, have fun.

40:52.792 --> 40:54.083
Vamos.

40:54.083 --> 40:55.083
Are you gonna get in the back?

40:55.083 --> 40:56.626
I'll go in the back.

40:56.626 --> 40:57.959
Let's go mix-mix.
Let's all go in the back.

40:57.959 --> 40:59.125
We can squish.

40:59.125 --> 41:03.209
Vamanos.

41:03.209 --> 41:04.667
Marcos.. don't let
them bring you down.

41:04.667 --> 41:06.751
-[bleep]
-Your cooking's fire.

41:06.751 --> 41:16.000
And the thing is, they're used
to McDonald's chicken nuggets.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.334
Ah!

41:17.334 --> 41:19.626
So, guys, should we
just say something

41:19.626 --> 41:22.542
that we're grateful for,
like how amazing that tip was?

41:22.542 --> 41:24.876
Thank you for this guy ----ing
left the boat tonight.

41:24.876 --> 41:30.250
Yay!

41:30.250 --> 41:32.751
You are an amazing
----ing chef.

41:32.751 --> 41:34.459
Don't listen to what
some lame charter guests

41:34.459 --> 41:35.709
think about your food, brÃ¼.

41:35.709 --> 41:36.501
I'm, like...

41:36.501 --> 41:39.375
I wanna say that
I never felt like

41:39.375 --> 41:41.959
a family in a such short time.

41:41.959 --> 41:44.167
And all you guys are so amazing.

41:44.167 --> 41:46.250
-Aw!
-Kudos!

41:46.250 --> 41:48.459
[cheering]

41:48.459 --> 41:49.792
Being a chef in this industry,

41:49.792 --> 41:52.250
it gets lonely in
the galley, definitely.

41:52.250 --> 41:53.959
But this crew is different.

41:53.959 --> 41:57.209
So... oh, wait, wait, we've got
tequilas, guys, let's go.

41:57.209 --> 41:58.626
They don't let you
drown yourself.

41:58.626 --> 42:01.751
We drown all togethers,
or we help you.

42:01.751 --> 42:03.000
I love it.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.626
Cheers to Marcos!

42:05.626 --> 42:10.042
I love you.

42:10.042 --> 42:13.292
Coming up...

42:13.292 --> 42:14.459
I know, I know.

42:14.459 --> 42:16.125
I might wanna sleep with her,

42:16.125 --> 42:16.125
but don't really wanna be
stuck with the consequences.

42:16.125 --> 42:26.334
$6,500,

42:26.334 --> 42:27.834
Are we ready to order?

42:27.834 --> 42:29.209
I would love to order.

42:29.209 --> 42:30.834
I'll have the fish.

42:30.834 --> 42:32.584
Oh, I wanted the burrata.

42:32.584 --> 42:34.542
I'll have the burrata
and the strawberry cake.

42:34.542 --> 42:35.834
What'd you order here?

42:35.834 --> 42:39.959
I'm hammered...
a margarita, of course.

42:39.959 --> 42:41.375
Bottoms up!

42:41.375 --> 42:43.959
You're like, "This is
not my first rodeo!"

42:43.959 --> 42:46.209
And these bitches kinda
know what they're doing.

42:46.209 --> 42:47.959
I'm gonna sleep in
until...

42:47.959 --> 42:49.959
All right...

42:49.959 --> 42:50.959
You girls are great.

42:50.959 --> 42:54.167
You girls just...

42:54.167 --> 42:55.709
You two are a team.

42:55.709 --> 42:58.042
I want it to be solid,
especially our team.

42:58.042 --> 42:59.501
Me, too.

42:59.501 --> 43:01.709
I don't give a sh--
about everyone else.

43:01.709 --> 43:04.709
Without the team, you
break down, you fall apart.

43:04.709 --> 43:05.626
Yeah.

43:05.626 --> 43:07.375
It's a hard lesson to learn,

43:07.375 --> 43:08.918
it's a lesson I had
to learn over and over again.

43:08.918 --> 43:10.292
Yeah.

43:10.292 --> 43:15.167
I'm gonna go pee now.

43:15.167 --> 43:17.209
Gabriela, come for a smoke.

43:17.209 --> 43:18.375
Hey, you, what's happening?

43:18.375 --> 43:19.792
I don't know what's happening.

43:19.792 --> 43:20.417
What do you mean?

43:20.417 --> 43:21.959
We were in our room earlier,

43:21.959 --> 43:25.125
and Gabriela said Gary
will [bleep] anything.

43:25.125 --> 43:28.834
Do you feel like Gary kind of
shoots his shot with everyone,

43:28.834 --> 43:32.000
and whoever bites is the one
that is gonna end up with him?

43:32.000 --> 43:33.667
Yeah.

43:33.667 --> 43:43.167
Like, you're the type of person,
you flirt with everyone.

43:43.167 --> 43:53.876
No, listen, just listen.

43:53.876 --> 43:56.375
It's occurred to me that
Ashley wants two things...

43:56.375 --> 43:59.375
my undivided attention,
and to get in my pants.

43:59.375 --> 44:03.584
Well, let's see what happens.

44:03.584 --> 44:07.042
I know, I know, and I know,
and that was like, I...

44:07.042 --> 44:08.751
I might wanna sleep with her,

44:08.751 --> 44:10.584
but I don't really wanna be
stuck with the consequences.

44:10.584 --> 44:12.167
We've got this season
together, all right?

44:12.167 --> 44:14.000
Yeah.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.626
I love everyone's personalities
for everyone.

44:16.626 --> 44:19.292
-I'm a bitch.
-No, you are not.

44:19.292 --> 44:20.959
Don't take
my title away from me.

44:20.959 --> 44:23.292
Okay.

44:23.292 --> 44:26.751
-Mwah.
-Aw!

44:26.751 --> 44:29.250
He loves Daisy.

44:29.250 --> 44:30.334
Oh, another one, okay.

44:30.334 --> 44:32.417
[chattering]

44:32.417 --> 44:33.709
Ow!
Oh! [bleep]

44:33.709 --> 44:36.334
Oi, it's stuck,
bro, holy sh--.

44:36.334 --> 44:41.167
-Strawberry?
-Yes, please.

44:41.167 --> 44:43.167
That's my ----ing girl.

44:43.167 --> 44:45.417
There you go.

44:45.417 --> 44:46.334
You!

44:46.334 --> 44:47.709
No, [bleep] no.

44:47.709 --> 44:50.751
Okay.
Come here... mwah!

44:50.751 --> 44:52.000
Jesus, Gary!

44:52.000 --> 44:53.375
Ugh!

44:53.375 --> 44:55.792
That was the best kiss
of my life.

44:55.792 --> 44:57.959
Well, she's taken bigger in her
mouth ----ing give it to her.

44:57.959 --> 45:00.375
Not you, clearly.

45:00.375 --> 45:01.751
You don't know
what I've got down here.

45:01.751 --> 45:04.375
We don't, and we'd just
tell you to sh--.

45:04.375 --> 45:09.959
It's not so visible
as some of us are.

45:09.959 --> 45:12.167
I'm very drunk.

45:12.167 --> 45:15.334
I'm outta here, my car's here.

45:15.334 --> 45:17.292
Long night, my friend,
long night.

45:17.292 --> 45:20.083
-Oh!
-What?

45:20.083 --> 45:23.000
Oh!

45:23.000 --> 45:27.417
What are we doing when we
go back? I need a plan.

45:27.417 --> 45:29.834
And then a drink.

45:29.834 --> 45:31.083
Okay.

45:31.083 --> 45:32.584
Watch this.

45:32.584 --> 45:35.626
Stop touching it, just leave it.

45:35.626 --> 45:37.167
Oh, why would you touch it?

45:37.167 --> 45:38.501
Ah!

45:38.501 --> 45:40.667
Come on... baby girls.

45:40.667 --> 45:41.876
Can I get out?

45:41.876 --> 45:42.959
Woo.

45:42.959 --> 45:44.667
No, no.

45:44.667 --> 45:46.626
You know what I don't
understand, Gary?

45:46.626 --> 45:48.959
Tell me, Gary, what
do you not understand?

45:48.959 --> 45:51.167
So, these girls, they all
work together

45:51.167 --> 45:52.584
and they all speak together,

45:52.584 --> 45:56.751
but then they all
throw themselves at you.

45:56.751 --> 45:58.209
-What is this?
-Tequila.

45:58.209 --> 45:59.709
Ah.

45:59.709 --> 46:06.292
Don't look at me like that.

46:06.292 --> 46:07.626
It's hard, because I know
it's not

46:07.626 --> 46:22.584
just gonna be
a few kisses with Ashley.

46:22.584 --> 46:25.751
Sh--, that feels good.

46:25.751 --> 46:29.042
Is that just from me...
whoa, what's going on here?

46:29.042 --> 46:30.918
Oi, naughty, naughty.

46:30.918 --> 46:32.501
Control yourself.

46:32.501 --> 46:34.959
[bleep] says you that's
dressed like that

46:34.959 --> 46:39.959
that's just like,
mother----er.

46:39.959 --> 46:41.959
[laughing]

46:41.959 --> 46:49.167
I'm gonna go change.

46:49.167 --> 46:51.000
You gonna go to beddy-beddy?

46:51.000 --> 46:52.959
I'm gonna go up and
have another drink.

46:52.959 --> 46:54.417
[bleep]

46:54.417 --> 46:55.417
Hey, stop, don't touch it,
don't touch it.

46:55.417 --> 46:56.918
Let me see it.

46:56.918 --> 46:58.167
Because he keeps rubbing
his hand through his hair.

46:58.167 --> 47:01.918
-[shouting]
-Yay!

47:01.918 --> 47:03.792
What are you doing?

47:03.792 --> 47:05.167
I don't know.

47:05.167 --> 47:06.792
He cannot touch his wound.

47:06.792 --> 47:08.959
Let's just make sure he
doesn't look stupid, yeah?

47:08.959 --> 47:10.501
[laughing]

47:10.501 --> 47:12.167
-Oh, really.
-Daisy, can you help me please?

47:12.167 --> 47:13.667
Go... go sideways?
Sideways.

47:13.667 --> 47:14.918
I just...
you just said wrap it.

47:14.918 --> 47:21.334
That's what I did.

47:21.334 --> 47:23.083
I just really want a drink.

47:23.083 --> 47:24.542
Do you need a drink?

47:24.542 --> 47:26.042
-How do you think he feels?
-Yeah.

47:26.042 --> 47:27.792
I'm... that's why I asked you...

47:27.792 --> 47:28.876
I asked him.

47:28.876 --> 47:29.959
[bleep] off, Colin.

47:29.959 --> 47:31.751
Look at Kelsie.

47:31.751 --> 47:32.792
What do you want?

47:32.792 --> 47:34.959
Just hold the gauze there so
he doesn't keep--

47:34.959 --> 47:36.083
No, not you, him.

47:36.083 --> 47:38.584
Somebody pass me
my drink, Kelsie.

47:38.584 --> 47:43.209
[bleep]

47:43.209 --> 47:48.250
Whew.

47:48.250 --> 47:49.959
Ugh!

47:49.959 --> 47:53.375
I'm traumatized.

47:53.375 --> 47:55.584
[bleep], you are fine.

47:55.584 --> 47:57.083
You are gonna live.

47:57.083 --> 47:59.584
Urgh! Ugh!

47:59.584 --> 48:02.042
If I go to bed, I'm gonna
wake up with no regrets.

48:02.042 --> 48:05.167
If I stay up, maybe I'll do
something I'll regret.

48:05.167 --> 48:06.792
Ugh!

48:06.792 --> 48:09.083
Why can't little Gary behave?

48:09.083 --> 48:10.918
Ugh!

48:10.918 --> 48:10.918
[bleep] Urgh.

48:10.918 --> 48:18.292
Are we ready to order?

48:18.292 --> 48:19.709
[bleep]
Gary.

48:19.709 --> 48:20.959
No, you're not gonna touch it,

48:20.959 --> 48:22.209
you're not gonna [bleep]
around with it.

48:22.209 --> 48:23.375
You're gonna drink some sh--.

48:23.375 --> 48:28.959
Take it easy.
Take it easy.

48:28.959 --> 48:33.042
[bleep].
[bleep].

48:33.042 --> 48:35.959
No, I'm going to bed.

48:35.959 --> 48:37.042
Just kidding.

48:37.042 --> 48:38.209
What do you want, a beer?

48:38.209 --> 48:41.792
-I feel bad.
-No, I'm okay.

48:41.792 --> 48:48.751
I don't know, because
I don't know how to handle it.

48:48.751 --> 48:50.667
-No, no, no, that's a lie.
-You're so annoying.

48:50.667 --> 48:54.334
Come here.

48:54.334 --> 48:59.167
Oh, you're so rosy-cheeked.

48:59.167 --> 49:01.042
Ooh, Gary, behave yourself.

49:01.042 --> 49:04.417
-You're so annoying.
-Let's go have fun.

49:04.417 --> 49:06.626
-Okay.
-Let's go.

49:06.626 --> 49:07.334
Oh!

49:07.334 --> 49:08.792
Can you take your own towels?

49:08.792 --> 49:11.250
Should we not use
the guest towels?

49:11.250 --> 49:12.584
No, don't take it off.

49:12.584 --> 49:15.250
-You are so drunk.
-Mm.

49:15.250 --> 49:18.584
-Are you okay?
-Mm-mmm.

49:18.584 --> 49:19.959
Hey!

49:19.959 --> 49:21.792
Colin, come around this side.

49:21.792 --> 49:23.876
This is the king of the Jacuzzi
being enabled.

49:23.876 --> 49:24.959
Whoa!

49:24.959 --> 49:26.584
Tom, Tom, Tom!

49:26.584 --> 49:27.751
Oh!

49:27.751 --> 49:31.709
If you wanna get me more
margarita...

49:31.709 --> 49:34.000
Yay! Yes!

49:34.000 --> 49:35.250
Tongue, no tongue, Daisy.

49:35.250 --> 49:38.959
-Me and her...
-Tongue or no tongue?

49:38.959 --> 49:41.584
Oh, my God.

49:41.584 --> 49:43.375
That's enough.
That's enough.

49:43.375 --> 49:46.375
Come sit down.

49:46.375 --> 49:49.918
You got a friend in me.

49:49.918 --> 49:55.042
Mwah!

49:55.042 --> 50:03.709
You've got muscles.

50:03.709 --> 50:06.709
Gary's signals are telling me
that he's not really interested.

50:06.709 --> 50:08.709
-Oh!
-It's like, whatever.

50:08.709 --> 50:11.876
I'm drunk and horny,
so I'm gonna have a good time,

50:11.876 --> 50:13.000
no matter what.

50:13.000 --> 50:20.167
Gary, where are you going?

50:20.167 --> 50:29.167
I'll be back in, like, say,
four and a half, five minutes.

50:29.167 --> 50:31.250
-You got any beers?
-Who spilled this?

50:31.250 --> 50:35.501
Ooh!

50:35.501 --> 50:36.834
I'm gonna have another drink.

50:36.834 --> 50:38.959
This is disgraceful.
This is disgraceful.

50:38.959 --> 50:40.292
We're gonna have to have
a crew meeting tomorrow.

50:40.292 --> 50:41.751
-Yes.
-Ah!

50:41.751 --> 50:44.334
Oh, yes.

50:44.334 --> 50:46.959
Don't drown the boy, down drown
the boy, we need him alive.

50:46.959 --> 50:48.834
For what?

50:48.834 --> 50:55.000
-For...
-Oh, sorry.

50:55.000 --> 50:56.751
Please do.

50:56.751 --> 50:58.167
Daisy, where'd you go?

50:58.167 --> 51:00.584
Oh, is one of those for me?

51:00.584 --> 51:02.792
-Dais...
-Do not touch me!

51:02.792 --> 51:03.751
Oi!

51:03.751 --> 51:06.876
If you wanna [bleep] a toad...

51:06.876 --> 51:08.167
I didn't say anyone.

51:08.167 --> 51:10.125
Did you just call me
a ----ing toad?

51:10.125 --> 51:11.542
I don't think this...

51:11.542 --> 51:13.125
Did you...
did you just call me a toad?

51:13.125 --> 51:15.167
No.

51:15.167 --> 51:16.167
Oh, right.

51:16.167 --> 51:18.042
Oh, I'm... okay, yes.

51:18.042 --> 51:22.542
A toad, I get it now.

51:22.542 --> 51:24.667
Tom has beautiful eyes,
a great body.

51:24.667 --> 51:27.334
We all know what my face did
when Tom walked in the door.

51:27.334 --> 51:31.584
Tom is very attractive, and I
know that I've written him off.

51:31.584 --> 51:33.792
But I'm at the point
where it's not worth me

51:33.792 --> 51:36.792
putting any
more effort into Gary.

51:36.792 --> 51:42.042
So, I think I'm warming up
to the idea of somebody my age.

51:42.042 --> 51:44.584
There, I said it.

51:44.584 --> 51:46.334
Can I have a bottle opener?

51:46.334 --> 51:47.959
Bar's closed, baby.

51:47.959 --> 51:49.250
You've had way too much.

51:49.250 --> 51:51.375
Where will we lie this...
there we go.

51:51.375 --> 51:53.417
Dry it, dry it out, dry it out.

51:53.417 --> 51:56.876
That's better.

51:56.876 --> 51:58.792
Open your legs.

51:58.792 --> 52:03.209
Open my legs?
Oh God, this is...

52:03.209 --> 52:04.584
This is fun.

52:04.584 --> 52:07.292
Why is there a strange
man behind my bar?

52:07.292 --> 52:08.626
Let me do my hair first.

52:08.626 --> 52:11.375
No, wait, wait, wait...
I'm not ready!

52:11.375 --> 52:13.834
I squashed the idea
of getting with Ashley.

52:13.834 --> 52:15.792
Like, it wasn't in
my head whatsoever.

52:15.792 --> 52:20.000
Have you ever heard of
the tortoise and the hare?

52:20.000 --> 52:23.000
Yeah, I am living proof that
the tortoise won the race.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.125
That looks funky.

52:24.125 --> 52:27.709
-No!
-Yes.

52:27.709 --> 52:34.709
Tom's about to get 'em.

52:34.709 --> 52:38.459
Yes, queens!

52:38.459 --> 52:52.042
You guys are so hot.

52:52.042 --> 53:00.959
Mm-hmm.

53:00.959 --> 53:02.959
Oh, Colin, it hurts.

53:02.959 --> 53:23.083
Oh.

53:23.083 --> 53:27.083
Ah!
