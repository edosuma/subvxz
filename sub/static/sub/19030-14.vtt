WEBVTT

00:03.536 --> 00:05.333
Here you go, Sammy.

00:06.673 --> 00:08.641
I know I was supposed
to drop Sam off in day-care,

00:08.675 --> 00:09.733
but the only other kid
that was there was

00:09.776 --> 00:11.300
that creepy little girl
with all the freckles.

00:11.344 --> 00:13.835
Please don't give my son
your prejudice of redheads.

00:13.880 --> 00:15.939
They're God's mistakes, J.D., accept it.

00:15.982 --> 00:17.506
You know what, let's not fight.

00:17.550 --> 00:21.008
Because, Sammy,
today is the seven-year anniversary

00:21.054 --> 00:23.852
of the first time
your daddy and I ever kissed.

00:23.890 --> 00:24.948
<i>J.D.: I forgot!</i>

00:24.991 --> 00:27.323
<i>Distract her so you can run</i>
<i>and get some flowers.</i>

00:27.360 --> 00:31.387
Darling, do you know what Sam loves?
When you sing <i>Old MacDonald.</i>

00:31.431 --> 00:32.455
He does?

00:32.499 --> 00:35.491
<i>J.D.: Nobody loved Elliot's</i>
<i>tone-deaf rendition of</i> Old MacDonald.

00:36.770 --> 00:39.568
<i>Old MacDonald had a farm</i>

00:39.606 --> 00:40.630
<i>Farm</i>

00:40.940 --> 00:42.407
<i>J.D.: It was so excruciating,</i>

00:42.442 --> 00:44.967
<i>I knew exactly</i>
<i>how long it took her to finish.</i>

00:45.011 --> 00:47.775
- Look out!
- <i>I had 44 seconds.</i>

00:47.814 --> 00:51.910
<i>And on that farm there was a cougar</i>
<i>E- I-E-I-Oh</i>

00:51.985 --> 00:55.250
<i>With a... here. And a... there</i>
<i>Here a... There a...</i>

00:55.288 --> 00:56.414
<i>Everywhere a... O...</i>

00:59.626 --> 01:01.059
<i>J.D.: Stupid line.</i>

01:01.628 --> 01:03.528
<i>You loved shoplifting</i>
<i>when you were a kid.</i>

01:03.563 --> 01:05.758
<i>Just grab something and run.</i>

01:07.367 --> 01:08.698
Be cool, honky.

01:08.868 --> 01:11.530
Oh, hey, Leonard. What's that?

01:13.173 --> 01:16.267
Hey! Look out! Wait a minute!
I'm talking to you!

01:16.643 --> 01:18.440
Leonard, calm down.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.206
<i>E- I-E-I-Oh</i>

01:21.247 --> 01:22.544
Did you like that, Sammy?

01:22.582 --> 01:23.879
No!

01:23.917 --> 01:26.181
I feel like you raped my soul.

01:27.487 --> 01:32.288
Oh, that was wonderful, darling.
I got you a little anniversary present.

01:32.859 --> 01:35.327
Why would you get me
a toothbrush?

01:36.096 --> 01:39.588
<i>Damn it! I thought it was a sex toy!</i>
<i>Okay, just cover.</i>

01:40.366 --> 01:44.132
I borrowed your toothbrush
this morning when I was showering,

01:44.170 --> 01:47.503
dropped it
and I may have peed on it a little.

01:47.540 --> 01:48.973
You pee in my shower?

01:49.008 --> 01:50.202
You know, baby, I'm making this up.

01:50.243 --> 01:51.608
I forgot to get you a present.

01:51.644 --> 01:54.545
- So you don't pee in my shower?
- Of course not.

01:54.581 --> 01:56.310
<i>Oh, yes, I do.</i>

01:56.349 --> 01:59.512
You didn't have to get me a gift
for the anniversary of a kiss.

01:59.552 --> 02:02.783
I mean, that's the best part
about us having dated before.

02:02.822 --> 02:05.450
We don't have to deal
with that drama ever again.

02:05.492 --> 02:07.119
You're the best.

02:09.829 --> 02:10.989
I ought to gut you.

02:11.030 --> 02:15.262
Look, that's how
the old Leonard used to behave.

02:15.301 --> 02:16.825
Hook it over.

02:19.939 --> 02:23.898
<i>J.D.: Spring was in the air and</i>
<i>everyone was getting caught up in it.</i>

02:24.177 --> 02:26.270
<i>Whether it was a new romance...</i>

02:26.312 --> 02:28.337
Hey, have you ever been
in love before?

02:28.381 --> 02:30.713
Once. She was a janitor.

02:30.750 --> 02:33.310
Well, for her, the mop
always came first, you know?

02:33.353 --> 02:36.618
And that was fine, until one day
I come home from work early

02:36.656 --> 02:38.317
and there they are in bed.

02:39.526 --> 02:42.495
They were just cuddling,
but still, you know.

02:42.529 --> 02:46.056
It was really the emotional betrayal
that makes it hard to talk about.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.828
But you've changed all of that for me.

02:50.570 --> 02:52.697
<i>J.D.: Or an old romance</i>
<i>still going strong.</i>

02:52.739 --> 02:54.138
Excuse me.

02:54.707 --> 02:57.369
Could you hold that, please?
Excuse me.

02:59.812 --> 03:02.474
Oh, my God, you make me so hot.

03:04.284 --> 03:05.376
Why?

03:06.186 --> 03:08.746
<i>J.D.: Other couples</i>
<i>just weren't clicking.</i>

03:08.922 --> 03:12.050
- Are you mad at me?
- I'm not mad. I'm hurt.

03:12.091 --> 03:16.289
You've been ignoring me so much
it makes me want to punch something.

03:17.263 --> 03:18.594
God, you're firm.

03:18.631 --> 03:20.394
I'm just bummed about Carla.

03:20.433 --> 03:22.367
Between Izzy
and her being pregnant again,

03:22.402 --> 03:24.597
it's like I don't have a wife anymore.

03:24.637 --> 03:26.229
She's just a mommy.

03:26.272 --> 03:27.830
Is it that bad?

03:28.808 --> 03:31.834
Don't you love listening to her breathe
on the baby monitor?

03:31.878 --> 03:33.277
Sometimes.

03:34.013 --> 03:37.005
Baby, I thought you said
you wanted to get it on.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.483
We're not finished?

03:38.518 --> 03:40.918
- We haven't started.
- Sorry. Do your thing.

03:43.756 --> 03:45.383
It's pretty bad.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.324
Dude, what the hell was that for?

03:47.360 --> 03:49.954
I wanted to see if it was just as firm
when you weren't expecting it.

03:49.996 --> 03:52.294
- And?
- Firmer.

03:52.332 --> 03:53.594
That's right.

03:54.534 --> 03:58.231
Okay, let's call this meeting
of the Brain Trust to order.

03:58.938 --> 04:01.998
Now, as you know,
ever since our esteemed member Lloyd

04:02.041 --> 04:04.100
died snorkeling in his father's pool,

04:04.143 --> 04:06.737
we've tried to make do
with the next best thing.

04:06.779 --> 04:09.179
Still, I think we realize
that's not really working out.

04:09.215 --> 04:12.207
Especially since Todd keeps
high-fiving it and knocking it over.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.720
Well, look how he's posed.
I can't resist.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.084
Yes, you can.

04:16.122 --> 04:18.454
That is why I had you over
to my garage last weekend

04:18.491 --> 04:21.016
to take my seminar on willpower.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.426
And you still owe me 60 bucks.

04:23.463 --> 04:27.524
Now, Brain Trust bylaw 47 A
clearly states what, Ted?

04:27.567 --> 04:29.762
- Live free or die.
- That's New Hampshire.

04:30.270 --> 04:34.570
47 A clearly states that we must always
have exactly four members.

04:34.607 --> 04:37.872
So, I proudly announce
the reinstatement of Doug Murphy

04:37.910 --> 04:40.708
as a permanent member
of the Brain Trust.

04:41.681 --> 04:44.206
Permanent member until you
find someone you like better, right?

04:44.250 --> 04:46.480
Come on. You're just being insecure.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.019
Dudes!

04:49.055 --> 04:51.683
You're alive. You're out.
Lloyd, you're back in.

04:51.724 --> 04:52.884
We thought you were dead.

04:52.925 --> 04:54.916
Faked my own death, bro.

04:55.428 --> 04:57.953
I was in debt big time to a bookie.

04:58.498 --> 05:01.194
Anyway, it didn't work out.
Saw me at a mall.

05:01.234 --> 05:04.635
So, what's new?
Can I borrow 80,000 bucks?

05:04.671 --> 05:05.933
Can't really swing that, Lloyd.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.132
Our credit line is over-extended

05:07.173 --> 05:09.607
since we had Cheap Trick play
at the Brain Trust picnic.

05:09.642 --> 05:11.576
- Yeah.
- Goodbye, Lloyd.

05:12.278 --> 05:14.769
- And Doug is back in. Permanent.
- Yes.

05:15.081 --> 05:16.878
You know,
until Lloyd gets back on his feet.

05:16.916 --> 05:20.079
Okay, meeting adjourned.
And, oh, almost forgot. Jeez.

05:20.119 --> 05:23.054
Ted, pass these out
to everyone in the hospital.

05:26.659 --> 05:28.217
Cardboard five!

05:28.628 --> 05:30.823
I want you in my garage this afternoon.

05:30.863 --> 05:33.525
Bring 120 bucks
and a steak sandwich.

05:35.535 --> 05:39.062
<i>I can't do this all on my own</i>

05:39.105 --> 05:40.697
<i>No, I know</i>

05:40.740 --> 05:42.708
<i>I'm no Superman</i>

05:45.645 --> 05:47.203
<i>I'm no Superman</i>

05:54.220 --> 05:55.312
What the hell is this?

05:55.355 --> 05:56.879
Oh, my God!

05:56.923 --> 06:01.292
"You are cordially invited to
the wedding of Lady and the Janitor."

06:01.327 --> 06:03.124
The Janitor is getting
married before me?

06:03.162 --> 06:05.494
That's it. I may actually kill myself.

06:05.531 --> 06:08.056
Of course, I'm the only one
who wasn't invited.

06:08.101 --> 06:09.432
Here's yours.

06:09.469 --> 06:12.199
<i>J.D.: Okay, do not reveal</i>
<i>how touched you are.</i>

06:12.238 --> 06:16.004
Turk, could you please pass me
the salt for my baked potato?

06:16.309 --> 06:18.436
This wedding is in three days.

06:18.478 --> 06:21.038
And it's in the Bahamas.
Nobody's going to this thing.

06:21.180 --> 06:22.670
I know I'm not.

06:22.715 --> 06:26.048
I heard, at night,
the octopuses come out onto land

06:26.085 --> 06:28.417
and drag people up into trees

06:28.454 --> 06:32.083
and rip their faces off
with their powerful suction cups.

06:32.825 --> 06:35.794
<i>J.D.: I guess I was moved</i>
<i>by the Janitor's invite,</i>

06:35.828 --> 06:37.523
<i>because I did this.</i>

06:37.563 --> 06:40.828
Look, I know the Janitor
isn't exactly a friend to us,

06:40.867 --> 06:45.304
but he is a part of our family,
a horrible, horrible part.

06:45.338 --> 06:47.431
Like an uncle
who shows up at your ballet class

06:47.473 --> 06:50.237
and whispers, "Good girl,"
when you pliÃ©.

06:50.276 --> 06:51.834
You have an uncle like that, too?

06:51.878 --> 06:53.243
That's not important, Carla.

06:53.279 --> 06:54.576
Still, I think we should use this

06:54.614 --> 06:57.378
as an opportunity
to go on a much-needed vacation.

06:57.417 --> 07:01.114
We work very hard.
And I think it's time to live a little.

07:01.154 --> 07:02.178
Hey!

07:02.555 --> 07:04.352
You really think we should go?

07:04.390 --> 07:08.486
Hey, Todd. I'm really just sort of talking
to these two tables.

07:08.528 --> 07:10.189
- Yeah, it's just the two of them.
- Just these two.

07:10.229 --> 07:13.494
But you said we should all live a little.

07:13.533 --> 07:15.899
And I think you should on your own.

07:15.935 --> 07:18.802
But in this circumstance,
I was really just talking to...

07:18.838 --> 07:22.069
Just mainly these two tables,
focusing here.

07:22.508 --> 07:25.341
Actually, I'm thinking about going.

07:26.412 --> 07:28.471
Hey, Bob. I...

07:28.514 --> 07:30.482
I didn't see you there.

07:31.017 --> 07:36.148
So, I am talking
to your table as well, Todd.

07:36.989 --> 07:40.823
But not your chair. Not your chair.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.862
<i>Surprisingly, my friends listened.</i>

07:44.697 --> 07:47.860
We can't go, Turk.
We've never left Izzy alone before.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.629
Baby, separation is healthy.

07:49.669 --> 07:51.864
Wanna know what happens to kids
who are too close to their mothers?

07:51.904 --> 07:53.929
- What?
- They end up like that.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.497
Well, Mom, when I'm gone

07:55.541 --> 07:58.669
I guess your feet
will just have to rub themselves!

07:58.711 --> 07:59.905
Ted has his own room now.

07:59.946 --> 08:02.244
He only sleeps with his mom
when he's had a bad dream.

08:02.281 --> 08:04.044
Or she has.

08:04.083 --> 08:07.075
Honey, all I'm trying to say is that
with Izzy and a new baby on the way,

08:07.119 --> 08:08.347
this might be our last chance

08:08.387 --> 08:10.378
- to have some you and me time.
- Okay.

08:10.857 --> 08:11.881
I'm in.

08:11.924 --> 08:13.516
Awesome. Think about it, Elliot.

08:13.559 --> 08:16.426
In three days, you'll be walking
on a beach in your bikini.

08:17.563 --> 08:19.588
- That's sexy.
- Shut up.

08:21.300 --> 08:22.426
Cool.

08:22.702 --> 08:25.637
What? I know I have to be
in a bathing suit.

08:26.539 --> 08:30.942
Hey, Feldman. Fire up the fat vac.
Momma needs some lipo.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.139
Dude.

08:35.948 --> 08:38.212
We are in for the Bahamas. Upstairs!

08:39.352 --> 08:41.717
Downstairs! Oh, yeah.

08:41.754 --> 08:42.948
I still don't like downstairs.

08:42.989 --> 08:44.923
Really? You haven't come around yet?

08:44.957 --> 08:47.118
Anyway, I got you a present.

08:48.761 --> 08:50.729
It's an exact replica of the tiki

08:50.763 --> 08:53.288
from "The Brady Bunch
Goes to Hawaii" episode.

08:53.332 --> 08:56.130
Greg had this on
when he got into the surfing accident.

08:56.168 --> 08:58.728
Peter had it on
when he saw the tarantula in the bed.

08:58.771 --> 08:59.931
- And Alice...
- Turk! Turk, Turk, Turk.

08:59.972 --> 09:01.906
I've seen it before.

09:01.941 --> 09:04.569
Do you remember the music they'd play
when anything bad happened?

09:06.913 --> 09:08.938
Wait. You don't have one.

09:09.282 --> 09:10.544
Or do I?

09:11.717 --> 09:13.014
Yes!

09:13.085 --> 09:14.245
- Downstairs!
- Really?

09:14.287 --> 09:15.754
No. What's wrong with you?

09:15.788 --> 09:18.552
I didn't wanna do it, either.
I think it's stupid.

09:18.591 --> 09:21.355
- Where'd you get them?
- I bought them on the interweb.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.693
The seller was anonymous,
but I think I know who it was.

09:27.166 --> 09:29.066
Sold! Finally!

09:29.702 --> 09:32.136
These things have been
ruining my life for too long.

09:32.171 --> 09:36.540
The curse is yours, John Dorian.
The curse is yours!

09:40.846 --> 09:43.280
Man, that guy hates normal doors.

09:43.749 --> 09:46.240
Do you think if we wear these
bad stuff will happen to us?

09:46.285 --> 09:48.150
That's kind of the fun, isn't it?

09:48.187 --> 09:49.245
- Turk.
- Huh?

09:49.288 --> 09:52.951
I need your signature on our
splenectomy patient's discharge form.

09:52.992 --> 09:54.584
This pen doesn't work.

09:56.562 --> 09:57.722
That's gonna be annoying.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.560
Now you made my woman all mad.

10:01.500 --> 10:02.797
Good God.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.668
Tiki bump.

10:10.142 --> 10:11.666
That was sex-tastic.

10:11.711 --> 10:13.440
My God,
I feel light headed.

10:13.479 --> 10:15.208
Yeah, good loving will do that to you.

10:15.247 --> 10:17.477
So will not eating
for 36 hours.

10:17.516 --> 10:19.279
Elliot, just say
it was the good loving, okay?

10:19.318 --> 10:20.979
You know, as a joke.

10:21.020 --> 10:22.453
Fine, it was the good loving.

10:22.488 --> 10:23.853
<i>I knew it.</i>

10:25.257 --> 10:26.485
J.D.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.090
Forget it.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.254
What?

10:31.230 --> 10:33.027
Okay. What the hell?

10:33.532 --> 10:34.897
Here goes.

10:36.369 --> 10:37.768
I love you.

10:38.571 --> 10:40.801
J.D., I love you so much
that the last thing I think about

10:40.840 --> 10:42.740
before we go to bed at night
and the first thing I think about

10:42.775 --> 10:45.744
when I wake up
in the morning is our future.

10:45.945 --> 10:47.310
Come here.

10:50.216 --> 10:51.843
I love you, too.

10:51.917 --> 10:54.750
<i>J.D.: And there it was.</i>
<i>A moment so perfect that I...</i>

10:54.787 --> 10:56.152
That's it?

10:56.722 --> 10:57.848
What?

10:58.124 --> 11:00.092
I did not just say,
"I love you."

11:00.126 --> 11:02.594
I actually explained
how much I love you.

11:02.628 --> 11:04.152
Plus, you weren't even looking at me
when you said it.

11:04.196 --> 11:05.356
But I do love you.

11:05.398 --> 11:07.559
I think that you're the most
amazing woman that I've...

11:07.600 --> 11:10.467
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
You are not getting off that easy.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.232
You have to obsess
over it a little like I did.

11:12.271 --> 11:14.933
See, I actually jotted down
some notes in my notebook

11:14.974 --> 11:17.499
on how to get into the whole
"I love you" conversation

11:17.543 --> 11:20.444
before I settled
on the fake-spontaneous-blurting thing.

11:20.479 --> 11:22.310
You do know
that you're a crazy person?

11:22.381 --> 11:24.008
- Of course.
- Just checking.

11:24.050 --> 11:28.146
Now, you think about it and surprise me
when I'm not expecting it.

11:28.954 --> 11:30.148
Night.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.629
Elliot, when I think about our love...

11:37.663 --> 11:39.028
- Too soon.
- Okay.

11:41.033 --> 11:44.059
What are you doing? The van
to take us to the airport is downstairs.

11:44.103 --> 11:45.365
It's called my job.

11:45.404 --> 11:48.373
It's that little thing I do
70 to 80 hours a week

11:48.407 --> 11:50.875
while you're eating, drinking,
napping, spending, plucking,

11:50.910 --> 11:53.845
ignoring the children
and singing rap tunes into a hairbrush.

11:55.081 --> 11:57.379
You forgot about the nanny-cam
in the bedroom, didn't you?

11:59.185 --> 12:01.915
<i>I like it like that</i>
<i>She working that back</i>

12:01.954 --> 12:04.479
<i>I don't know how to act</i>
<i>Slow motion for me</i>

12:05.224 --> 12:07.784
I did. But I'm okay with it.
'Cause I'm fly.

12:07.827 --> 12:11.593
You realize I'm probably gonna have to
work the entire time we're down there.

12:11.630 --> 12:14.030
The only thing better than
going on vacation without our kids

12:14.100 --> 12:15.499
is going on vacation without our kids

12:15.534 --> 12:17.058
and you're too busy
to spend time with me.

12:17.103 --> 12:18.434
You don't mean that.

12:18.471 --> 12:21.269
I do. It's an amazing gift.

12:25.010 --> 12:26.375
Come on!

12:27.980 --> 12:29.641
Dear God.

12:32.251 --> 12:33.741
What the hell are you wearing?

12:34.053 --> 12:36.783
Just got my Bahamas gear on.

12:36.822 --> 12:40.189
J.D., have you seen
my cute white linen shirt?

12:40.726 --> 12:41.784
I think it looks better on me.

12:41.827 --> 12:44.591
Babe, I know that you're very proud
that you've been working out, okay,

12:44.630 --> 12:46.063
but we're in a hospital, so button up.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.259
Fine. But the second we get
to the Bahamas,

12:48.300 --> 12:50.029
it's going to be raining abs.

12:52.304 --> 12:54.738
<i>In my heart you come first place</i>

12:54.774 --> 12:57.140
<i>When I turn and twist like that</i>

12:57.176 --> 13:01.306
<i>It's because I love you so much</i>

13:03.282 --> 13:05.682
<i>It's sung for my country</i>

13:07.086 --> 13:09.316
Hope Town! We made it.

13:12.591 --> 13:16.425
Oh. Oh, baby, look at this place.

13:17.963 --> 13:22.093
Okay. So Izzy drank
her whole bottle, right? Okay.

13:22.902 --> 13:24.369
Okay, great.

13:24.570 --> 13:26.094
Excuse me,
when you're done with that phone,

13:26.138 --> 13:28.504
may I borrow it to call my kids?

13:29.041 --> 13:30.633
- Really?
- No.

13:30.676 --> 13:32.234
Say, did you even bother
to tell the babysitter

13:32.278 --> 13:34.041
she has to stay overnight
this weekend?

13:34.079 --> 13:35.774
Well, she'll figure it out.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.908
Ted, wait here for my bag.

13:39.718 --> 13:41.811
Got enough sunscreen on there, Ted?

13:41.854 --> 13:44.789
I go through a tube
about every three hours.

13:46.959 --> 13:48.654
My skin drinks it.

13:52.464 --> 13:54.261
J.D.: What's that about?

13:54.300 --> 13:56.530
Todd went to med-school there.

13:56.569 --> 13:59.037
<i>And then we saw</i>
<i>where Todd got it from.</i>

13:59.071 --> 14:03.701
<i>His old professor was</i>
<i>the best high-fiver in all the world.</i>

14:07.613 --> 14:09.046
Earthquake!

14:10.416 --> 14:13.783
<i>J.D.: And then we'd all have sex</i>
<i>to celebrate surviving.</i>

14:15.788 --> 14:17.346
Chop, chop, Ted.

14:17.389 --> 14:19.289
I could kill him here.

14:19.925 --> 14:21.916
You know how much I love you?
When I first...

14:21.961 --> 14:23.155
Yeah, not in front of everybody.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.254
Plus, I'm a little light headed.

14:25.297 --> 14:27.629
Maybe that's because
you haven't eaten in three days.

14:27.666 --> 14:29.258
I know what my body can take!

14:29.301 --> 14:30.563
Don't care.

14:30.603 --> 14:31.900
Let's go.

14:38.577 --> 14:40.340
- Tiki time.
- Yes.

14:41.313 --> 14:42.871
Should we go check in
with everybody else?

14:42.915 --> 14:44.177
Not yet.

14:46.652 --> 14:48.142
I gotta whiz.

14:51.924 --> 14:53.551
There's a bathroom, like, right there.

14:53.592 --> 14:55.719
I know, but I'm already in.

14:55.928 --> 14:57.418
Fine, Elliot.

14:59.999 --> 15:03.059
You know, the Abacos
have incredible snorkeling.

15:03.102 --> 15:04.535
Since you're not a strong swimmer,

15:04.570 --> 15:08.028
let's say we get really, really,
really drunk and go later.

15:08.073 --> 15:10.166
Darling, I distinctly
remember telling you

15:10.209 --> 15:11.471
that I had to do some work down here.

15:11.510 --> 15:14.707
But if you'd like me to stop so that
we can spend some time together,

15:14.747 --> 15:18.274
you just say the word.

15:18.951 --> 15:20.145
Never.

15:20.185 --> 15:23.086
Hey, meathead.
I've got a present for you.

15:23.122 --> 15:27.559
- I'm thinking of going bone fishing.
- I'm going bone fishing right now!

15:27.593 --> 15:29.720
And Ms. Sullivan,
thanks so much for that set-up.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.753
You're welcome. Go away.

15:32.965 --> 15:34.091
Hey!

15:34.500 --> 15:36.365
No way!

15:38.771 --> 15:40.898
- I can't believe you came.
- I know, right?

15:42.775 --> 15:44.367
Why the hell did you come?

15:44.410 --> 15:46.002
I rallied the troops.

15:46.045 --> 15:47.808
I invited you to a wedding
in a foreign country

15:47.846 --> 15:48.870
on three days' notice.

15:48.914 --> 15:51.542
You weren't supposed to come.
I just wanted the gifts.

15:51.583 --> 15:54.381
Do you see any
of the other 847 invites here?

15:54.420 --> 15:56.251
We're not even
having a ceremony, man.

15:56.288 --> 15:57.846
All right, well, then,
we'll just have a vacation.

15:57.890 --> 16:00.290
- No harm done.
- All right.

16:00.426 --> 16:02.519
- You have to!
- Elliot, you are so right!

16:02.594 --> 16:05.791
- Honey, we're gonna have a ceremony.
- A big one.

16:07.366 --> 16:09.129
I'm gonna kill you.

16:13.205 --> 16:14.467
<i>We loved our hotel room,</i>

16:14.506 --> 16:17.134
<i>but then Elliot saw something</i>
<i>that made her skin crawl.</i>

16:22.448 --> 16:24.177
Here's the towels you wanted.

16:24.917 --> 16:26.578
Thanks, sweetie.

16:27.786 --> 16:31.244
There's no way I'm using those after
that little redhead freak touched them.

16:31.290 --> 16:33.554
I can smell his freckles.

16:33.726 --> 16:37.253
I can't believe you hid this hatred
from me for seven years.

16:37.296 --> 16:38.661
Deal with it.

16:38.697 --> 16:41.564
Hey, babe,
what are you doing in there?

16:42.034 --> 16:44.229
Just putting some sun screen
on my face.

16:44.269 --> 16:46.260
Good, 'cause

16:46.305 --> 16:48.136
I think now might be a really nice time

16:48.173 --> 16:50.641
to tell you that
I love you so much that...

16:50.676 --> 16:53.440
- J.D., I'm pooing.
- See you at the beach.

16:57.483 --> 16:59.576
I mean, I miss Izzy,

16:59.618 --> 17:03.019
but I always imagined being
someplace like this with you.

17:04.455 --> 17:06.320
Just be here, Turk.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.723
Hey, Diane.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.354
Here comes my ex-wife
and your beard.

50% real. Enjoy.

17:26.811 --> 17:31.806
You two both gotten a good look?
Some of this. A little of that. Yeah?

17:31.850 --> 17:34.182
Good. Then we're done. Give me that.

17:34.219 --> 17:38.087
Oh, my God. Conch fritters.
You guys, I will see you later.

17:38.123 --> 17:40.853
I'm gonna go get, like, 40 of these.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.093
She should have gotten the lipo.

17:45.297 --> 17:47.697
It does hurt a little bit
when I sit, though.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.996
Hey, Gandhi.
Here comes your better half.

17:53.338 --> 17:55.499
That's what I'm talking a...

17:57.976 --> 17:59.238
...bout?

18:00.779 --> 18:02.838
She's wearing shorts and a mom suit.

18:03.982 --> 18:04.914
No, don't you...

18:04.950 --> 18:06.178
My wife.

18:06.218 --> 18:08.584
Hi, guys! How you...

18:08.787 --> 18:12.484
Oh! I left my cell phone in
the room. I'm gonna go back and get it,

18:12.524 --> 18:14.822
in case something happens
with Izzy, okay? I'll be back.

18:14.860 --> 18:16.691
How awesome is this?

18:20.866 --> 18:23.198
Doesn't look any better going away,
does it, Gandhi?

18:23.235 --> 18:24.532
No.

18:24.570 --> 18:27.937
I got two words for you guys,
banana and hammock.

18:37.282 --> 18:40.410
Baby. You know why
I love the Bahamas?

18:40.452 --> 18:43.319
They got brothers on the money.
Check it. Ha!

18:44.223 --> 18:46.157
Don't that look like Uncle Dottie?

18:46.191 --> 18:47.624
Why aren't you out on the beach?

18:47.659 --> 18:50.025
Because daddy came to seduce you.

18:50.262 --> 18:51.354
But for me to get in my sexy mode,

18:51.396 --> 18:53.728
I'm gonna need you to take off the hat
and stop picking your toes.

18:59.438 --> 19:01.804
It's all right, I'll push through it.
Baby, look,

19:01.840 --> 19:08.040
Izzy's not here and this is the Bahamas.
The islands of making love!

19:09.214 --> 19:13.275
You. Me. The ocean.

19:14.319 --> 19:16.810
Underwater relations.

19:17.189 --> 19:19.987
- Lead the way.
- Yes.

19:23.028 --> 19:24.928
That's the nanny.

19:24.963 --> 19:26.260
This'll just take a second.

19:26.298 --> 19:28.630
Okay. It's cool.
I'm gonna head down to the water.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.328
It'll be just like our honeymoon.

19:30.369 --> 19:33.770
Nobody will see what we're doing
except for the mermaids.

19:33.805 --> 19:37.104
Baby, for the last time,
mermaids aren't real.

19:37.142 --> 19:38.769
I know what I saw, woman!

19:38.810 --> 19:40.471
Don't yell at me.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.310
Hi. How's she doing?

19:46.919 --> 19:48.819
You know what else you should do
when you tell me you love me?

19:48.854 --> 19:51.414
Keep your hands away from her mouth.

19:52.791 --> 19:54.224
Hey, you...

19:56.361 --> 19:58.659
My God, she ate the rind.

19:58.697 --> 20:01.097
Anyway, when you tell me,
make sure I'm wearing something cute.

20:01.133 --> 20:03.533
Like that new blue bikini I got.
It really helps my eyes pop.

20:03.569 --> 20:05.366
Elliot, stop, okay?

20:05.938 --> 20:08.964
You told me you loved me.
I told you I loved you back.

20:09.007 --> 20:10.565
We both know
how we feel about each other.

20:10.609 --> 20:14.067
That should be enough, right?
Stop acting so crazy.

20:18.717 --> 20:21.550
<i>I know it's wrong,</i>
<i>but with our relationship clicking,</i>

20:21.587 --> 20:23.248
<i>I couldn't help but feel smug</i>

20:23.288 --> 20:27.190
<i>watching everyone else's melt</i>
<i>in the hot Bahamian sun.</i>

20:28.327 --> 20:31.421
Oh, my God. Are you ever gonna
stop working and have some fun?

20:31.463 --> 20:34.364
See, I knew darn well
you were full of crap

20:34.399 --> 20:37.129
when you said you didn't care
if I spent time with you.

20:37.169 --> 20:41.629
But truth be told, I finished all my work
on the plane before we got here.

20:41.673 --> 20:44.301
I just wanted to prove a point.

20:50.482 --> 20:52.712
The wind is really taking that baby.

20:52.751 --> 20:53.775
Oh.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.654
Carla, where are you?

20:58.824 --> 21:03.158
Hey, sweetie. It's okay, it's okay.
Mommy's here.

21:03.862 --> 21:07.855
<i>None of that drama for Elliot and me.</i>
<i>For us it was smooth...</i>

21:09.301 --> 21:11.394
J.D.: Elliot, where are you going?

21:11.436 --> 21:12.994
She's all mad.

21:17.142 --> 21:20.009
Gary, I'm going to need
two mamas, please.

21:21.146 --> 21:22.704
Thank you, sir.

21:25.484 --> 21:26.781
For what?

21:28.287 --> 21:30.380
- Can I at least have your fruit?
- Get out!

21:34.226 --> 21:36.160
Ted, you had one job.

21:36.194 --> 21:40.130
Keep the people I invited
from actually coming to the wedding.

21:40.165 --> 21:42.156
Did you tell them about the octopi
that drag them into trees

21:42.200 --> 21:43.394
and suck their faces off?

21:44.636 --> 21:47.070
I did but they didn't believe me.

21:47.472 --> 21:50.441
What? Okay. This isn't a problem.

21:50.475 --> 21:53.205
Did you remember to pack
the giant octopus suit I made for you?

21:53.245 --> 21:54.712
Crap.

21:54.746 --> 21:56.907
Teddy! You're killing me!
