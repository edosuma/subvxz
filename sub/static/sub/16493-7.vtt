-Hi, Mrs. Murphy.

And if so, does he have proper coverage?

He's still at work.

Melissa and Zack were

How is our liability coverage?

02:04.500 --> 02:06.291
Oh, better idea. Not at our home.

02:06.375 --> 02:07.417
We could do it at the Play Park.

02:07.500 --> 02:08.959

I understand, Amanda. I'm trying to
figure out the streamer situation,

03:16.959 --> 03:17.875

if there's really a
cohesive color scheme,

03:19.417 --> 03:21.500
and the balloons I'm ordering are
all different sizes and shapes,

03:21.583 --> 03:23.583

gonna be a problem...

Hey, Melissa!

Just installed the new

Oh! What's with the arm? Sprained it.

03:38.959 --> 03:42.083
Problem is, my dad has an important
package to be picked up at the mall.

03:42.166 --> 03:43.792
I can't do it with this arm.

03:43.875 --> 03:45.583
I know it's your birthday and all,

03:45.667 --> 03:47.750
but any chance you can pick it up
and drop it off at this address?

03:47.834 --> 03:49.375
Sure! I'd be happy to help.

03:49.458 --> 03:50.792
Think of all the times you helped me

No problem.

04:05.208 --> 04:06.625
Nice acting job.

early for the party?

I mean, watch your step
and watch your step.

04:24.125 --> 04:26.834
Is this Elliot who monitors
local safety violations?

04:26.917 --> 04:30.875
Well, "safety first" is certainly
one of my six safety-related mottos.

04:30.959 --> 04:32.667
I'd like to report a violation.

04:32.750 --> 04:36.875
I just saw Milo Murphy's bike, and the
back wheel is a definite safety hazard.

04:36.959 --> 04:38.041
It might fly off any second.

Don't be ridiculous.

You couldn't possibly
have another duck back...
