00:22.990 --> 00:24.356
I have brought you all
to the park

00:24.358 --> 00:25.957

00:25.959 --> 00:28.427
Starfire is going to blow
some bubbles

00:28.429 --> 00:30.595

But, why?

02:53.540 --> 02:55.407
Oh, I don't know.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.843
Maybe it's because
you do not have that
cool, funky, fresh style.

02:57.845 --> 03:01.680
Or maybe, it's 'cause
you the Mayor of Loserville!

03:01.682 --> 03:03.081
Why are you being so mean?

10:42.409 --> 10:45.443
<i>♪ It seems to me</i>
<i>we've had enough ♪</i>

10:46.745 --> 10:48.379
