00:17.185 --> 00:17.751
You better get
used to this.

00:19.387 --> 00:22.490
In the Territories
everything's barren
and windswept.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.125
Barren and
windswept beaches,

00:24.158 --> 00:26.227
barren and
windswept mountains,

00:26.260 --> 00:29.130
barren and windswept...
You know,
if you talked less,

00:29.163 --> 00:30.498
maybe you could walk faster.

00:30.531 --> 00:31.565
(SCOFFS)

00:32.833 --> 00:34.302
Where are we anyway?

00:35.169 --> 00:36.537
Where?

00:36.570 --> 00:38.572
We're, uh...

00:38.606 --> 00:40.408
You have no idea,
do you?

00:40.441 --> 00:42.143
(LAUGHS) What?

00:42.176 --> 00:44.412
Yeah, I have an idea.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.447
What happened to,
"I know where
I'm going, Sunny.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.217
"You don't need a map, Sunny.
I am the map, Sunny."

00:49.250 --> 00:50.584
I know exactly
where we are.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.222
Oh, not exactly.
"Approximately."

00:54.255 --> 00:56.524
But I know
where we're going.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.260
You said you knew
a shortcut through the Wall.
I did, yeah.

00:59.293 --> 01:00.561
Well, what I meant was
I know a smuggler

01:00.594 --> 01:01.862
who knows a shortcut
through the Wall.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.298
A smuggler!
That's reassuring.

01:04.332 --> 01:06.567
Yeah, he's a friend
of mine. Named Nos.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.502
He's got
his own secret tunnels.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.371
Now, the problem is,
we're gonna need
something to trade,

01:10.404 --> 01:12.373
and right now we've got
a whole lot of nothin'.
(SIGHS)

01:12.406 --> 01:13.407
But you know what, hey!

01:13.441 --> 01:15.176
It'll be fine.

01:15.209 --> 01:16.577
Something will turn up.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.279
It always does.
I'm resourceful
that way.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.115
Come on, keep up.

02:14.402 --> 02:17.171

No! Not yet.

02:18.306 --> 02:19.473
But, hey, I'm hopeful.

02:20.974 --> 02:24.378
Look, we don't want
any trouble.

02:24.412 --> 02:26.280
Then you shouldn't have
brought them with you.

ever since you escaped
the mines.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.330
Every Stalker with
a rusty blade is after you.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.498
Including these
low-life mongrels.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.200
They're not with you?

02:46.234 --> 02:47.635

I don't run with a pack.

It's your choice.

Hey, wait for me!

04:38.779 --> 04:39.813
Hey!

05:27.728 --> 05:27.895
Hey.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.831
We gotta ditch
this guy.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.466
He just saved our asses.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.734
Yeah, so he can
gain our trust.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.436
And why would he do that?

05:35.469 --> 05:37.471
So he can lop off our heads
and collect the bounty.

05:45.779 --> 05:48.148
Ah, shit!

05:48.181 --> 05:50.618
He's a Clipper.

05:50.651 --> 05:53.721
Maybe even a better Clipper
than you judging
by all them kill tats.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.423
But then, you knew
that already, right?

05:55.456 --> 05:57.591
(LAUGHS) That's why
you trust him.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.593
What if his Baron has
sent him to get you?

05:59.627 --> 06:01.729
All the way out here?

06:01.762 --> 06:04.465
The only Baron who'd care
is mine and I killed him
already, remember?

06:04.498 --> 06:05.499
Yeah.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.606
Still, I don't like him.

06:17.778 --> 06:18.812
Let's move.

Hello?

07:14.034 --> 07:15.435
Is anybody here?

07:19.973 --> 07:21.775
MASTER: You should be
in the mess hall.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.880
I need to know
what happened to my mother.

07:26.914 --> 07:30.818
You won't be returning
to the Mirror Chamber
anytime soon.

07:30.851 --> 07:34.688
But why? You just...
Because last time
you lost control.

07:34.722 --> 07:37.658
First you must learn
to stop fighting yourself.

07:37.691 --> 07:40.561
The consequences
could be deadly.

07:40.594 --> 07:41.662
And not just for you.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.834
It's a long road, M.K.,

07:48.268 --> 07:49.737
don't look for shortcuts.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.473
(SIGHS)

08:01.882 --> 08:03.751
Ryder called the conclave,

08:03.784 --> 08:07.755
and as
the "aggrieved party,"
he gets to host it.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.823
Aggrieved?

08:09.857 --> 08:11.692
He should be thankful
he's alive.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.661
(CHUCKLES) Maybe.

08:13.694 --> 08:16.597
Still, it's a hell of
a smart play.

08:16.630 --> 08:19.299
And we have to walk into
this lion's den unarmed.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.870
Rules are each Baron brings
one second and no weapons.

08:22.903 --> 08:26.273
Ryder's Clippers are
there strictly
to patrol the perimeter

08:26.306 --> 08:28.876
just in case
a Nomad feels ambitious.

08:28.909 --> 08:29.977
So, six Barons.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.980
Means I need
at least two to back me.

08:33.013 --> 08:36.717
It means you need
to start winning some hearts
and minds at the reception.

08:36.750 --> 08:37.851
On your side.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.020
Ryder maybe
running this show,

08:40.053 --> 08:43.757
but odds are not everybody's
happy about him scarfing up
Jacobee's territory.

08:43.791 --> 08:44.892
And on his side?

08:44.925 --> 08:47.695
They all hate you.
Face it.

08:47.728 --> 08:52.032
"The Widow." Not exactly
a term of endearment.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.101
Have you made
the other preparations
that we discussed?

08:54.134 --> 08:56.336
TILDA: Everything's
in place.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.971
I'm glad
I'll be there with you.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.943
(CLEARS THROAT)

09:02.976 --> 09:04.544

09:09.750 --> 09:12.720
I'm taking Waldo
to the conclave .

09:12.753 --> 09:14.655
I want you to stay
and guard the Sanctuary.

09:14.688 --> 09:16.757
As Regent, it's...
It's my duty
to protect you.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.726
I can't stay behind.

09:18.759 --> 09:21.795
(COUGHS) Look, you got
a few kills under your belt,
but so what?

09:21.829 --> 09:23.731
How many battles
have you been in?

09:23.764 --> 09:25.365
How many Barons
have you met?

09:25.398 --> 09:27.334
No, no,
Madame Butterfly here,

09:27.367 --> 09:29.937
she needs more
than a fighter at her side
during the conclave.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.005
She needs a strategist.

09:32.039 --> 09:35.643
Now, I know all the players,
and I know how to play.

09:35.676 --> 09:38.979
Also, I know
how to follow orders.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.082
Hmm.

09:42.115 --> 09:45.819
If these are
Mother's wishes then,
of course, I'll obey them.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.655
If anything happens to her,

09:48.789 --> 09:50.791
I'm holding you responsible.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.827
Well, no need
for threats, Tinker Bell.

09:53.861 --> 09:57.731
If things go south,
hell, I'll be dead, too.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.739
I couldn't have gotten
this far without you.

10:07.675 --> 10:09.609
Together we have
a lot further to go.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.714
I want you to hold on
to these for me.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.115
I can't bring them.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.654
You're in charge
until I return.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.927
And if I don't,

10:26.960 --> 10:30.998
blow up the oilfields before
they fall into enemy hands.

That should do it.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.503
Mmm...

11:43.536 --> 11:47.074
Why do I always feel
like asking you to take
a little off the top?

11:47.107 --> 11:48.809
You'd trust me
with scissors?

11:48.842 --> 11:50.878
I already trust you
with my life.

11:50.911 --> 11:54.481

a good haircut is
a riskier proposition.

(EXHALES) For turning her out
with nothing but the clothes
on her back?

I was duped into thinking
she tried to kill
my lovely young bride

12:08.028 --> 12:10.230
who has since taken up
with my son.

for the opportunist she was.

is such
a delicate thing, Veil,

so easily clouded
by love, or hate.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.952

12:31.985 --> 12:33.253
All this training.

What, what is it that
your men are preparing for?

we all pay for
our sins, eventually.

Except for those of us
who are still pure,
ain't that right, Henry?

Well, this will take
a little while to develop.

Once from a sword wound
right here,

13:10.891 --> 13:13.793
and the other from
a malady in my head. (LAUGHS)

these foul concoctions,

my headaches.

doing in there?

Oh!

14:23.463 --> 14:26.066
Yeah. You stick to milk.

Yeah.

14:51.158 --> 14:52.659
Your friend
doesn't talk much.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.194
No.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.129
He prefers
punching people,

14:56.163 --> 14:58.265
when he's not slicing
and dicing them up.

14:58.298 --> 15:00.000
Ooh!

15:00.033 --> 15:01.969
Is that true?

15:02.002 --> 15:05.238
You prefer
fighting to talking?

15:05.272 --> 15:09.309
My mentor once told me
of a legendary Clipper,

15:09.342 --> 15:12.445
a Regent
who left the Badlands,
never to be heard of again.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.214
His name was Nathaniel.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.283
Nathaniel Moon.

15:18.051 --> 15:20.020
Seems I heard that name.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.688
Yeah, me too.

15:21.721 --> 15:24.057
They call him "Silver Moon."

15:24.091 --> 15:28.295
They say
he prowls the Territories,
hunting for fugitives.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.330
Don't believe the whispers,
my friend.

15:30.363 --> 15:33.400
Sure, I bring in
the odd runner now and then.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.437
But I'm not out here
for your bounties.

15:37.470 --> 15:40.440
See, back in the Badlands,
we would kill each other
for our Barons.

15:40.473 --> 15:44.477
But out here, out here
I like to think of us as, uh,

15:44.511 --> 15:46.946
brothers, not enemies.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.186
Why'd you leave?

15:54.187 --> 15:55.255
What were you looking for?

15:56.189 --> 15:57.357
Peace, I guess.

15:59.492 --> 16:02.229
Doesn't matter
how brutal the world is,

16:02.262 --> 16:06.299
if you kill enough,
it hollows you out.

16:06.333 --> 16:09.769
I guess, I wanted to see
if I could make myself
whole again,

16:09.802 --> 16:11.404
even find some kind
of redemption.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.407
And did you?

16:14.441 --> 16:16.076
NATHANIEL:
I met her out here.

16:16.109 --> 16:17.344
A warlord's daughter.

16:17.377 --> 16:20.747
I won her in battle...
(CHUCKLES)

16:20.780 --> 16:22.215
...and then she won me.

16:23.450 --> 16:26.086
We had a son.

16:26.119 --> 16:29.422
But because of them,
I was happy.

16:32.125 --> 16:34.461
I mean, the kind
you can feel in your gut.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.130
It's like a warm fire
going on in there.

16:37.164 --> 16:38.765
That's how I felt
every moment.

16:38.798 --> 16:41.134
Just looking at them.

16:41.168 --> 16:44.104
I should've known
it couldn't last.

16:44.137 --> 16:47.774
I used to think it would be
my Baron to come after me.

16:47.807 --> 16:53.280
Instead, it was
the brother of a Nomad scum
that I clipped for him.

16:53.313 --> 16:55.415
Took him years
to track me down.

16:55.448 --> 16:59.018
Only, instead of finding me,
he found my wife and my son.

17:00.253 --> 17:01.421
I came home,

17:03.423 --> 17:07.094
and found their heads
on the kitchen table.

17:07.127 --> 17:09.462
Their eyes reproaching me
like I was late for dinner.

17:11.498 --> 17:16.169
Yeah, sure, I found it.

17:16.203 --> 17:19.539
After that I, uh,
I slipped back
into my old ways.

17:19.572 --> 17:22.409
I needed something
to focus on, so I started
collecting bounties.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.248
Tell you what, Sunny.

17:28.281 --> 17:29.382
You can run.

17:30.283 --> 17:31.484
Far, far away.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.588
But there's no escaping
what they turned us into.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.459
You had a family
back there?

17:39.492 --> 17:41.060
There's, uh...

17:42.329 --> 17:44.063
A woman waiting for me.

17:46.466 --> 17:49.068
She was, uh,
pregnant when I left.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.172
She'd have had
the baby by now.

17:54.874 --> 17:59.212
Yeah, well,
if you care for them,
don't go back.

18:20.167 --> 18:20.567
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

18:21.401 --> 18:23.503
Hey, Doc, it's Edgar.
You in there?

18:28.375 --> 18:29.409
Edgar.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.546
Could you take
a look at my hand?

18:36.549 --> 18:39.152
I guess I'll need
some stitches, huh?
Yeah.

18:39.186 --> 18:41.488
You're gonna need
a whole bunch.

18:41.521 --> 18:43.290
You know what,
Henry is sleeping.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.391
I'll stitch you up outside.

18:51.531 --> 18:54.201
We were on patrol,
and... (GASPS)

18:54.234 --> 18:55.268
I tripped.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.638
Cut myself on my own sword.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.907
Accidents happen.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.542
Now Declan says I can't go.

19:04.511 --> 19:05.512
Go where?

19:05.545 --> 19:07.146
(DOOR OPENING)

19:11.418 --> 19:13.186
(STUTTERS) Gabriel,
what happened?

19:15.688 --> 19:18.191
Declan!

19:18.225 --> 19:19.959
He got caught trying
to escape through
the south tunnel.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.661
What's Quinn gonna do to him?

19:21.694 --> 19:24.397
Probably clip him as
an example to the others.

19:39.579 --> 19:44.351
I wanted to be outside,
on my own,
just for a little while.

19:44.384 --> 19:47.954
Being down here
day after day,
it's too much.

19:47.987 --> 19:52.359
Gabriel, how can we hold
a conversation if you
won't admit the truth?

19:55.528 --> 19:57.464
You were running away,
weren't you?

19:58.598 --> 19:59.732
Yes, Baron.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.635
I know why you ran.

20:03.336 --> 20:05.272
Fear.

20:05.305 --> 20:08.375
It's the strongest
human emotion bred
into us for one purpose,

20:08.408 --> 20:10.577
to keep us alive.

20:10.610 --> 20:14.347
But it can also kill us,
if we let it, hmm?

20:16.616 --> 20:20.587
This was given to me
when I was a Colt on
the eve of my first mission.

20:20.620 --> 20:24.457
I had to sneak in,
clip a Regent
while he slept.

20:24.491 --> 20:28.328
But after
I climbed through
that man's window,

20:28.361 --> 20:30.463
I was paralyzed with fear.

20:30.497 --> 20:32.565
My fear was so potent,

20:32.599 --> 20:35.335
it felt like
an invisible hand had thrust
a stake down through my body,

20:35.368 --> 20:37.270
nailing me to the ground.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.472
That Regent woke up,
he saw me,
and reached for his sword.

20:39.506 --> 20:43.042
In that split second
I realized,
I have a choice,

20:43.075 --> 20:45.011
I can die
a forgotten coward,

20:45.044 --> 20:48.781
or I can live
to be celebrated
and remembered.

20:48.815 --> 20:52.619
Before that Regent
even touched his sword,
I slit his throat.

20:52.652 --> 20:56.356
Four of his bodyguards
stormed into the room,
I clipped them all.

20:59.392 --> 21:02.595
To this day,
before every battle,

21:03.530 --> 21:05.264
fear visits me,

21:06.766 --> 21:09.569
but now I embrace it
as a friend.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.772
It's what makes you faster,
stronger, smarter.

21:12.805 --> 21:14.641
As long as
you control it

21:14.674 --> 21:16.743
instead of letting it
control you.

21:20.580 --> 21:21.714
You understand me?

21:23.082 --> 21:25.051
Yes, Baron.

21:25.084 --> 21:26.519
I have faith in you,
Gabriel.

21:26.553 --> 21:28.521
Indeed, I sense
a kindred spirit,

21:28.555 --> 21:31.458
a young man who has
the potential to grow
into a great Clipper.

21:31.491 --> 21:33.826
Maybe the greatest Clipper
the Badlands ever known.

21:44.471 --> 21:46.739
I'm gonna give you this
as a token of my faith.

21:49.576 --> 21:51.378
If you can pass this test.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.314
Prove yourself
by cutting me.

21:56.749 --> 21:59.352
Baron, I don't think...
Stop your thinking, hmm?

21:59.386 --> 22:02.455
Use that fear pumping
through your heart
and cut me.

22:03.590 --> 22:04.757
Cut me.

22:09.862 --> 22:11.464
Where?

22:11.498 --> 22:14.467
Well, that's entirely up
to you, Gabriel.

22:14.501 --> 22:17.604
Don't be a disappointment,
I've had too many in my life.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.839
Go on. Cut me! Hmm?

22:19.872 --> 22:21.374
I won't wait here forever.

22:21.408 --> 22:22.642
Are you a Clipper
or a coward?

22:22.675 --> 22:24.343
Show me!
(SHOUTS)

22:28.548 --> 22:29.749
(PANTING)

22:32.151 --> 22:33.620
How dare you?

22:37.156 --> 22:39.959
(LAUGHING) Well done.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.497
Well done.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.901
(BREATHES DEEPLY) Yeah.

(GRUNTING)

23:29.709 --> 23:30.943
Can't sleep, huh?

23:35.548 --> 23:37.717
Maybe it's the surroundings.

23:37.750 --> 23:38.818
Or maybe it's the dreams.

23:42.955 --> 23:44.791
When I can't sleep I train.

23:46.559 --> 23:48.695
(GRUNTS)

23:48.728 --> 23:50.797
Nine hundred
and ninety-nine kill tats.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.532
In case
you were wondering.

23:52.565 --> 23:53.966
What's your tally?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.935
Four hundred and four.

23:55.968 --> 23:57.704
That's how
they manipulate you.

23:59.539 --> 24:00.940
The Barons.

24:00.973 --> 24:03.710
They make it a game
out of taking men's lives.

24:03.743 --> 24:05.845
(GRUNTS)

24:05.878 --> 24:08.948
Nine hundred and ninety-nine
seems like an odd number.

24:08.981 --> 24:11.818
One short of a goal that
I realized was pure vanity.

24:14.721 --> 24:16.556
Plus, I was running
out of skin.

24:16.589 --> 24:18.691
(SCOFFS)
The truth is,

24:18.725 --> 24:23.029
we've killed more men
in single combat than most
Barons have in their wars.

24:23.062 --> 24:24.964
That's not an easy burden
to deal with.

24:26.933 --> 24:28.701
How do you deal with it?

24:28.735 --> 24:31.871
By realizing
I'm a poor killer
by comparison.

24:31.904 --> 24:33.606
By comparison to what?

24:33.640 --> 24:34.974
The gods, if they exist.

24:35.007 --> 24:36.909
They're the greatest killers
of all.

24:36.943 --> 24:39.579
But by killing
they do us a mercy,

24:39.612 --> 24:41.881
because it's the end of life,
not its beginning,

24:41.914 --> 24:44.517
that defines
what it means to be alive.

24:44.551 --> 24:45.618
(GRUNTS)

24:48.655 --> 24:51.758
I made my peace by choosing
to live in those moments,

24:51.791 --> 24:53.793
by making
the taking of a life

24:53.826 --> 24:55.695
the highest expression
of my skill.

24:57.797 --> 24:59.532
There's honor in it that way.

25:02.034 --> 25:03.636
Not for me,

25:05.037 --> 25:06.639
not anymore.

25:08.975 --> 25:10.943
Maybe all I've known
is killing,

25:14.914 --> 25:18.050
but I know
that's not all there is.

25:18.084 --> 25:21.621
That's because
you still believe you can
have an ordinary life.

25:21.654 --> 25:23.956
Which means

25:23.990 --> 25:26.058
you're headed for
an ugly reckoning, too.

25:26.959 --> 25:28.527
So that's it?

25:29.929 --> 25:31.898
Just keep killing?

25:31.931 --> 25:34.667
Until I run into someone
good enough to kill me.

25:37.704 --> 25:40.072
Or someone good enough to be
worth that thousandth tattoo.

25:48.981 --> 25:50.717
Maybe that's your decision.

25:52.952 --> 25:55.955
But I'm not willing
to give up my chance
of a better life.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.559
(CHUCKLES) Sunny.

26:01.761 --> 26:03.696
Do you think
the gods get to retire?

26:04.697 --> 26:07.700
We kill because in the end

26:07.734 --> 26:08.968
that's what we're meant to do.

26:11.704 --> 26:12.872
(GRUNTING)

26:22.381 --> 26:23.816

little tune.

26:55.782 --> 27:00.820
My mother used
to sing that to me
when I was a kid.

27:00.853 --> 27:04.791
Her entire life was
a melancholy little tune.

27:04.824 --> 27:07.660
Our escort to
the conclave is waiting.
You ready?

27:09.862 --> 27:10.897
Waldo.

27:11.864 --> 27:13.866
Why are you doing this?

27:13.900 --> 27:16.035
I already told you.

27:16.068 --> 27:19.005
I know the players,
their strengths, their weak...
You backed me over Quinn.

27:19.038 --> 27:21.040
But you never asked
for anything.

27:21.073 --> 27:22.775
Not even the regency.

27:25.077 --> 27:26.145
Why?

27:27.146 --> 27:28.781
Being Regent...

27:30.750 --> 27:32.852
It's not just what I did.

27:32.885 --> 27:34.854
It's who I was.

27:34.887 --> 27:36.889
When Quinn retired me,

27:37.924 --> 27:39.091
I was one sorry bastard.

27:41.460 --> 27:43.662
You bet I'm grateful
to be back in the game.

27:46.265 --> 27:48.701
I'll tell you something,

27:48.735 --> 27:50.803
life looks different
from down here.

27:51.771 --> 27:53.906
From this chair.

27:53.940 --> 27:55.908
Back when I was standing tall

27:55.942 --> 27:59.979
I never bothered
to notice all the people
living on their knees,

28:00.012 --> 28:05.017
all the people whose lives
are melancholy little tunes.

28:06.886 --> 28:08.955
Those are the ones
I'm fighting for.

28:10.122 --> 28:11.690
That's why I'm here.

28:12.925 --> 28:14.126
Is it?

28:14.160 --> 28:15.995
You questioning
my sincerity?

28:18.130 --> 28:20.967
Power is a pricey doll.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.004
You get a taste for it,
you keep coming back for more.

28:25.037 --> 28:27.139
Somewhere along that road,

28:27.173 --> 28:28.908
good intentions,
they get lost.

28:28.941 --> 28:32.812
You would do well
to keep that in mind.

28:32.845 --> 28:34.747
Did you speak
to Quinn this way?

28:34.781 --> 28:36.115
No.

28:36.148 --> 28:37.316
(CHUCKLES) No.

28:38.117 --> 28:39.752
It's time.

28:41.153 --> 28:42.254
So...

28:43.255 --> 28:45.825
You ready to face the music?

28:45.858 --> 28:48.160
And make them dance
to my tune.

34:07.446 --> 34:09.548
Hey, you shaved
your beard off.
Time to get going.

34:09.581 --> 34:12.151
You wanted to leave,
didn't you?
Yeah.

34:12.184 --> 34:14.553
(CHUCKLES) I think your mate
might have spiked my booze.

34:14.586 --> 34:16.222
Where is he anyway?

34:16.255 --> 34:17.656
We've already said
our goodbyes.

34:19.125 --> 34:21.327
Let's go.
Uh, okay.

34:22.661 --> 34:24.096
Oh.

If I don't make it
back to the Badlands,
find Veil,

34:40.579 --> 34:43.482
I can't say for sure
where she is now.

34:43.515 --> 34:45.884
But when you track her down,

34:45.917 --> 34:48.487
tell her I love her.
Yeah, sure.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.289
You wanna tell me
what's going on?

34:50.322 --> 34:53.859
Well, in return for giving
you two shelter, Bajie.

34:53.892 --> 34:56.195
I must now ask something
from your friend.

34:58.264 --> 34:59.631
He wants our heads
after all.

35:00.399 --> 35:01.867
(CHUCKLES)

35:01.900 --> 35:04.336
Come on,
then let's do it.
No.

35:04.370 --> 35:05.637
This is between us.

35:07.506 --> 35:09.275
NATHANIEL: I'm not after
a bounty,

35:09.308 --> 35:11.643
but something that means
a lot more to me than gold.

35:13.312 --> 35:14.880
A worthy opponent.

35:14.913 --> 35:17.416
I thought you said out here,
men like us were brothers.

35:17.449 --> 35:19.618
I did, yes.

35:19.651 --> 35:24.356
See it's been much too long
since I met someone
whose skill matched my own.

35:24.390 --> 35:26.325
I want that
challenge, Sunny,

35:26.358 --> 35:30.128
and honestly that thrill,

35:31.430 --> 35:36.635
even if it's just
one last time.

35:36.668 --> 35:40.506
I have no quarrel
with you, Nathaniel,

35:40.539 --> 35:43.642
and no wish
to spill your blood.

35:43.675 --> 35:46.278
Who the hell said anything
about spilling my blood?

35:47.946 --> 35:52.518
See, the moment
I saw you fight,

35:52.551 --> 35:54.620
I knew you were that
one-thousandth tattoo.

that gets to say thanks.

39:05.877 --> 39:08.480
I guess this is what
I've been searching for.

39:09.881 --> 39:11.583
An honorable death.

39:16.855 --> 39:20.426
I'm not gonna be
your executioner.

39:20.459 --> 39:22.794
I earned this death
and you deny me?

do it, partner.

a promise to keep.

Sorry it had to be this way,

from getting to my family.

40:03.201 --> 40:05.604

than you think.

our ticket out of here.

I can't wait
to see Nos's face.

40:08.840 --> 40:09.908
You'd take my sword?

40:09.941 --> 40:10.976
Yeah, yeah I would.

40:15.781 --> 40:18.484
You'll leave
a trail of bodies

40:18.517 --> 40:19.951
before you make it
back to your family.

40:22.654 --> 40:23.922

the last ones.

you would make it.

are already inside.

keep them waiting.
