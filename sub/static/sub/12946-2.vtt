WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
: I am not a prophet.

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
But sometimes I have prophetic dreams.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
Like the one where I was at a garden party.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Excuse me.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Everyone, I have a brief announcement to make.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
Jesus was black,
Ronald Reagan was the devil,

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
and the government
is lyin' about 9/11.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Thank you for your time and good night.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
No!

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
That can't be true!

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
: Here's something

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
black people have known

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
for a couple of hundred years:

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Niggas are crazy.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Black people don't like to talk about crazy niggas in public

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Unhand me!

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
'cause white people may be listening.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Hi-ya!

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
But I'm afraid the secret might be out.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
MAN:
He's on fire!

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
: Former singer Whitney Houston

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
appeared in court

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Somebody get some water.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
alongside husband Bobby Brown,

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Ow!

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
who's facing battery charges

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Mm-hm. You havin' that dream
where you made

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
for allegedly beating his once-respectable wife.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
the white people riot,
weren't ya?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
But I was tellin' the truth!

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Hell to nah! Bobby don't hit me.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
How many times have I told you,
you better not even  dream

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
See, we have this TV show, a-and it's-- It's our TV show.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
about tellin' white folk
the truth?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
And I was tryin' to get more time on it.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
You understand me?

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
It's my show, bitch!

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Shoot.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Makin' white people riot.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
You know,
I think they're on drugs.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
You better learn
how to lie like me.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
I'm gonna find me a white man
and lie to him right now.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Let's see what's on BET.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Oh, Lordy-Lord.
Oh, shake it to the right.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Mm. Shake it,
shake it, shake.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
You boys cover your eyes.
Shake, shake, shake.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Got to leave something
to the imagination.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
That's just showin'
too much booty. Turn it.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
And on our "Talking Points" this evening,

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
it seems like the hip-hop community

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
is trading in their gold chains

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
for gold showers.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
Hip-hop singer R. Kelly is on trial again this week

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
for sharing some of his liquid bling

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
with yet another underage girl.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Some advice for Mr. Kelly:

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Next time, use a golden shower curtain

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
and keep your golden showers to yourself.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
What's wrong with a man
giving away a golden shower?

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Sounds like
a nice gift to me.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
What? Shoot, I wish somebody
gave me a golden shower.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
One, I like gold.
Two, I like showers.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Put it together, hey,
that sound like the life.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Hoo!

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
If you're good,

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Sorry, Billy Blanks,
but why buy the tape

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Santa Claus might give you
a golden shower for Christmas.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
when you can get
the infomercial for free?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Whew!

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Christmas?

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
My man Santa.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
And controversial R & B superstar R. Kelly

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
will be heading into court tomorrow

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
What the hell?

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
for the first day of his latest highly anticipated trial

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Boys!

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
for child pornography

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
and lewd acts with a local minor.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Granddad, can you take us
into the city tomorrow

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Would one of y'all like
to explain this?

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Uh...

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
to watch the R. Kelly trial?

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
You mean, the orange juice
or the miniskirt?

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Hell, no.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
But you can walk.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Which one of y'all drank
the last glass of orange juice?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
It's 40 miles.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
That's the last full day's
supply of vitamin C.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
All the money I spent
on them damn Nikes?

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Heh. You better
"just do it."

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
What am I supposed to do
about my vitamin C now?

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Assistant District Attorney Thomas DuBois

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Y'all need to start
appreciatin' your granddaddy.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
is leading the prosecution of Kelly

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
I went and spent
your inheritance

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
and has a mountain of evidence

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
on this beautiful house
in this neighborhood.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
against the famous R & B performer,

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
including a videotape allegedly showing Kelly

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
And all I ask you to do

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
is act like you got some class.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Hey, what's class?

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
urinating on a 14-year-old girl,

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
It means don't act
like niggas.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
which is widely available for download

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
S-see? That's what
I'm talkin' about right there.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
at www.FreeToPee.com.
Ooh.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
We don't use the N-word
in this house.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Granddad, you said the word
"nigga" 46 times yesterday.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
I'm gonna go, uh...

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
I counted.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
check my e-mail.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Nigga, hush.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Now, you may not like it,

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Yeah.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
but I moved y'all out here

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
to expand your horizon.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Get your little short ass
back here!

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
There's a  new  white man
out here.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
He's refined.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
For example, did you know

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
that the new white man
loves gourmet cheese?

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
TOM:
Hey, boys!

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Wait.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
I'm sorry,
did you say cheese?

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Yep, cheese.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Hey there, Huey.
Riley.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
You give the meanest white man
a piece of cheese,

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
I couldn't help
but notice your sign,

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
and I hope you boys
aren't too upset about me

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
and he turn into Mr. Rogers.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
having to prosecute Mr. Kelly.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Granddad,
that doesn't make sense.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Don't you talk back to me.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Hey, man, you do
what you gotta do.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Granddad, you can't tame

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Why R. Kelly, huh?
What did R. Kelly do to you?

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
the white supremacist
power structure with cheese!

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Oh, yes, I can!
No, you can't!

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
He's accused
of relieving himself

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
GRANDDAD: Yes, I can!
No, you can not!

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
on an underage girl
on tape,

03:32.000 --> 03:32.000
HUEY:
Cheese.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
which is
against the law.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
How can somebody that old

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Okay, okay, okay.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
say somethin' that stupid?

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
But let's examine
this whole peein' thing.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
RILEY:
I know about white people too.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Like, when they talk,

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
So I can pee in a toilet,
and it's okay,

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
they say the whole word,

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
like this.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
but if I pee on a person,
it's, like, not okay?

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
Well...yeah.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
HUEY:
Why'd he even move us

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
out here?

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
Well, what if I'm peein',
and Huey's in the bathroom,

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Probably did it
just to make us miserable.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
and I accidentally pee
on Huey?

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
RILEY:
And white people take time out

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
to study.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Should I go to jail?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
What the hell would I be
doin' in the bathroom

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
I hate this place.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
while you're
in the bathroom?

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
RILEY: And  white people arrest you.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Hold up, hold up.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Remember when we used
to sleep in the same bed

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Man.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
when we was littler?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
From time to time,
I'd have a little accident.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
RILEY:
Hey!

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
You still do.
Shut up.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
So, Mr. DuBois,

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Looks like the feds.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
Mr. "I Wanna Lock Niggas Up
for Peein',"

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
what's the statute of
limitations on bed-wettin'?

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
Why not prosecute me and
R. Kelly at the same time, huh?

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Now, Riley, no one's
going to prosecute you

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Who the hell could be
knockin' on this door

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
this early in the mornin'?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
for bed-wetting.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
And you shouldn't.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
If it's a Jehovah Witness,
I'm kickin' his ass.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
It's a natural bodily function.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Yes?

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
I'm looking for Robert Freeman.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
And now every nigga in the world
gonna be scared to pee.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
I'm Robert Freeman.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
I may never pee again!

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
I'm Ed Wuncler.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Riley,
it was a little girl!

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
From Wuncler's
Savings and Loan.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
Oh, I seen that girl.
She ain't little.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Uh, so?

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
I'm little.
Yes.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
I own the bank
that owns your house.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Gary Coleman's little.
Yes.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Mini-Me is little.
Very.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Oh, well--

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
And to the best
of my knowledge,

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Come in, sir.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Welcome to your house.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
we all managed to avoid
gettin' peed on so far.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
But what about the victim?

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Oh, yes, the victim.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
Robert, my family founded
Woodcrest over 170 years ago.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
At what point does
personal responsibility

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
become a factor
in this equation?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
I don't think that--

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
I was born here,
and I still live here.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
I see piss comin',
I move.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Mm.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
She saw piss comin',
she stayed.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
I consider this place
to be family,

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Yes, she did,
but--

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
And why should I have
to miss out

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
on the next R. Kelly album
just for that?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
and I'm very selective

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
about who I allow
in to that family.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
Man, you just got beat
by an 8-year-old.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
You understand
what I'm saying, Robert?

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
And if R. Kelly goes to jail,
I'll piss on your cat!

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
Hey, yes,
I totally understand.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Would you like some...

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
cheese?

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
Did you just offer me cheese?

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Yes, I did.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
RUCKUS:
I tell you,

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
it sure is beautiful out here.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
I'd love some cheese, thank you.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
White folks sure know
how to make some nice foliage.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Hm.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Riley!

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Ah, come on, Ruckus.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Go get the fancy cheese.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
I'd like to ask some questions,
if you don't mind.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
You can't give the white man
credit for the trees.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
Where them two little
nappy-headed grandkids of yours?

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
Are you gay, and if so,
do you have a gay lover

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
living with you
in the house?

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Ah, they went into the city

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
to watch the trial
of that singer.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
Oh, right, right.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Gay? No, I'm not gay.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
That black sumbitch
that supposed to have had

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
urinal relations with
that underage colored gal.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
I mean, I happen to think
a man looks nice

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
with good hair and a ponytail.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
Didn't Jerry Lee Lewis
marry a 14-year-old baby?

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
But, no, mm-mm, I'm not gay.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
What's your position
on gay marriage?

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
You can't compare
a chocolate monkey like R. Kelly

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Well, first of all,

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
to Jerry Lee Lewis!

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
I believe all marriage
is wrong.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
Jerry Lee Lewis
is the king of rock 'n' roll!

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Great balls of fire!

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Good one, good.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Besides,
that situation was different.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Uh, you don't look
like you associate

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
That was family.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
with any Muslims,
Arabs, you know.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
MAN:
We're here

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
at the R. Kelly trial,

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
People of terrorist descent?

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
where there are
a handful of angry protesters

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Uh, well...

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
making their voices heard.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
These are scholars, activists,

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
RILEY:
We got Kraft,

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
and we got Velveeta.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
pillars of
the African-American community,

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
and they are outraged.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
And we're just going
to head over here

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Your grandson?

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
to the R. Kelly supporters,

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Afraid so. Ahem.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
where it's quite
the festive event.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
And you are?
Hey!

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
You know, I have a grandson too.
He's--

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Now, why did you come out here
to support R. Kelly?

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Is that right?

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
'Cause he good!

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Well, heh-heh-heh,

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
And what about those protesters
over there

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
this has been delightful.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Well, it's really been
a pleasure, Mr., uh--

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
who say he's crossed the line?

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Mm.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
I-Own-Everything.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Man, fuck them literate-ass,
uppity niggas.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
We should get together soon

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
and have, uh...
more cheese.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
All they talk about
is readin' and eatin' right.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Like a nice Brie
or a G-Gouda--

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Nobody wanna hear
all that shit.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
G-Gayda-- Gouda.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
If I wanna get
high blood pressure, then--

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
Heh. You know, you're
my kind of guy, Freeman.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Nigga, get the carrot
away from me!

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Old school.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
If I wanna get
high blood pressure,

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
then damn it,
that's my business!

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
What are you doin' tomorrow?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
We're throwin' a garden party

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Let's talk to another
R. Kelly supporter.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
for my grandson.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Uh, you there,
urban youth.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
He just got back from Iraq.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Why do you think
R. Kelly is innocent?

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
You should stop by,
meet some of the neighbors.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
If I started peein'
on you right now,

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Bring the kids.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
would you, A,
smile and ask for more,

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Sounds like a splendid idea.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
or B, move the hell
out the way?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
I'll see you tomorrow.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
But before you answer that,
let me ask America:

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Uh, thanks for stoppin' by.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Cheers.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Has pee ever
really hurt anybody?

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
And I wanna give a big shout-out
to my homey,

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Huey!

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
GRANDDAD:
This damn thing looks real.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
D-Bone, whassup?!

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Can I have my gun back?

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Okay, that's enough.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Oof.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Get off me!

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Son of a--!

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Get off me, Huey!

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
GRANDDAD:
A garden party?

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
Free R. Kelly!

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Yeah, boy.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Hey, yo, yo, yo! Look!
Free R. Kelly!

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
I might buy sandals
and new underwear.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Those R. Kelly haters
are oppressin' that little boy!

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Oh, you shot me!

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
RILEY:
Free R. Kelly!

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
Granddad tried
to assassinate me.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Free-- Argh!

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
Boy, what did I tell ya?
This is the new white man.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
MAN:
Get out of here, y'all.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
He's distinguished.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
MAN 2:
We know what we talkin' about.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Granddad, I do not sip tea
with the enemy.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
MAN 3: Get 'em!
WOMAN: You want a piece of me?

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
You could force me to go,

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Aaaahhh!

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
but you cannot force me
to be someone I'm not.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
The hell I can't!

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
You gonna go and you're
not gonna embarrass me

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
I knew it would be
just a matter of time

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
in front of my new neighbors,
or I'm gonna beat your ass.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
before violence broke out.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Why can't we be ourselves, huh?
Why can't I be me?

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
It's pandemonium here
at the R. Kelly trial.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Are you ashamed of us?
Very.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Oh, the humanity!

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
We never asked
to move here

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
with your precious
new white people, Granddad.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Didn't ask?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Well, you didn't ask for us

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
to be attacked
by dogs and fire hoses,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
so you can live here,
but we did it anyway.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Oh, here he go again with
the dogs and the fire hoses.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Shoot, we  were  attacked
by dogs and fire hoses.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Were you attacked?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Mr. Kelly!
Mr. Kelly!

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Do you have
a statement?

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
I-I don't know what difference
that makes.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
This is truly
an example

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Because it's like
the whole generation

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
of black people
stickin' together.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
In the words of Sister Souljah,

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
tries to take credit for
what happened to some people.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
"An injustice anywhere
is an injustice...

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
That's ridiculous.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
anywhere."

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Now, see--
Well, you know--

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Amen.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Uh, what had happened was...

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
MAN:
Get out of here.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Go, go, go!

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
MAN:
Come on, get out of here.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
What did O.J. Simpson say
to Kobe after his case was over?

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Aw, man.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
What's that?

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
I missed it.
Was it bad?

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Don't let this whole trial thing

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Did they do the thing
with the fire hoses?

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
turn you off to white women.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
What do you think, chump?

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
That's funny on so many levels.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Damn, what's eatin' you?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
A goddamn German shepherd,
that's what.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
Lord, I just wish they would
let me on that jury, boy.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Where was you?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
I-I had to go back
to the apartment

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
'cause I forgot
my raincoat.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Thank God for the white man's
court of law.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
You went to--? You--?

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
This nigga went to get
a motherfuckin' raincoat.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
It's the only way to keep these
crazy niggas under control.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
I can't believe you.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
We all been watchin'
the same news.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Well, that
and pepper spray.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
The police been doin'
this fire hose thing all week.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
You know,
I sat on a jury one time.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
I just assumed
we'd all wear our raincoat.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Really?

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Oh, yeah.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Damn it, Robert.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Who the hell comes
to a march with a raincoat?

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
It was in 1957,
back in Tennessee.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Bet you wish
you had a coat now.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
You son of a bitch!

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Now, the defendant was accused

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
GRANDDAD:
Remember what Dr. King said!

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
of shootin' three little white women

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
with a Winchester rifle from about 50 yards away.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Who actually got hit with
the fire hose ain't important.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Now, we goin' to this party,

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
and your black asses
are gonna behave.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
See, now, he thought he was gonna get off

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
with that old "I'm blind" excuse,

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
If I'm lucky, I'll find myself
a nice white woman

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
but, oh, boy, he had another thing comin'.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
with a flat booty
who'll listen to my problems.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
JUDGE:
The jury will now go off

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
and deliberate on--

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Guilty!

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
That nigga is guilty!

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
Sir, settle down.
You have to go deliberate.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
I don't need to deliberate.
Hang that nigga now!

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
GRANDDAD:
Now, the word for the day

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
is "behave."

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
H-E-A-V-E.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
I got the rope right here!

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Behave.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
I'm comin', I'm comin'.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Excuse me. Out of the way,
Kunta Kinte! Yes, sir.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
King me.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
How can I help ya?

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
GRANDDAD:
Excuse me?

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
TOM:
Lady Liberty is on our side.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
Justice will prevail.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
Oh, Lord have mercy.
Security. Security.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
The judge and jury
will do the right thing.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
We got a Code Black.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
I'm telling you, Huey,
it's an open-and-shut case.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Code Black at the main gate.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
:  ■ Ruckus, what the hell

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Mr. DuBois,
are you fully aware

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
is a Code Black?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
the extent to which
niggas love R. Kelly?

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
There are some hungry-lookin'

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
niggas at the front gate.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Oh, Huey,
it's under control.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
What y'all doin' here?

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
Deliveries are in the back.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Watch me work.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Well, my name is Robert Freeman,

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
I was invited here
by Ed Wuncler.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
Well, I'm Ruckus.
Uncle Ruckus, no relation.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
And I work for Mr. Wuncler.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
And you slick niggas

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
And so, ladies and gentlemen,

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
ain't gonna fast-talk your way
into this here party.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
not only will we prove
it is Mr. Kelly in the video,

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Ruckus, what the hell
are you doing?

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
we will prove
that the victim was 14

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Uh, Mr. Freeman,

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
I'm sorry.
Please, come this way.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
at the time
the video was shot.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Thank you, Mr. DuBois.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
GRANDDAD:
See, boys?

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
And you thought we'd be
the only black people.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
And now we'll have
the opening statement

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
for the defense.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
ATTORNEY:
The ancient Greeks,

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
the architects
of Western civilization,

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
would regularly indulge
in sexual activities

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
with children.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
Were they...perverts?

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
In Puritan America,

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
the forefathers
of this great land

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
would take wives
who were 12 or 13 years old,

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
much younger
than the alleged victim.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
Were they...sickos?

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
In Tokyo, you can buy
teenage girls' panties

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
in vending machines.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
Do we call them...

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
"disgusting"?

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Of course not!

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
What do all those things
have to do with Robert Kelly?

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Nothing.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Let's get to the point.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Now, some people see
this so-called "mountain"

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
WUNCLER:
Robert!

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
of evidence,

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
these "videotapes,"
"photographs,"

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Glad you made it, Robert.
This is my grandson, Ed III.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
"eyewitnesses" and "DNA,"

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
How are you?

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Whassup y'all, what's good?

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
and see a guilty man.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Uh...so I understand
you just got back from Iraq.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
But some of us can see
that "mountain"

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
For real?

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Yo, what's it like?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
What's it like?

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
of so-called "evidence"

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
What I supposed
to say to that?

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
for what it really is:

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
It was cool, there was bitches?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
racism.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Okay, there was bitches,
but a lot of them had,

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
MAN:
Oh, he said it right there.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
you know, they was covered up

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
in them curtains and stuff
they be wearin'.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
But I digress.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
It was war!

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Which one was the one
that got caught

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
with that homely,
little white gal?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
It was war, basically.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Kobe.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
War, you know what that's like?

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Right.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Motherfuckers be,
like, shootin':

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Now, I know exactly
what happened to Kobe.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Kobe caught
that white fever.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Bombs blowin' up.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
White fever will get
in your blood, man.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
And, you know,
the shit scared me.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
It'll make you crazy.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
It scared the shit out of me.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
Matter of fact, I shit on myself
over a dozen times

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
And you know they got them
short, little skirts nowadays

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
and that, uh-- What--?
What they call them?

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
and ran out of toilet paper
after the second time.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
The--? The--? The tongs?

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
So you know
what that meant, right?

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Thongs.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Yeah, right.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
They got the thongs
all up the booty crack,

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
I had to use the thumb, man.
It was kind of nasty.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
and they got
that sweet white nectar.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
But, you know,
the good thing about it

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Oh, Lord, have mercy.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
was they stopped taking me
out on patrol.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
And after that, it's over.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
'Cause my name
became "Stink Bomb."

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
You wake up, and you don't
even know what you darn done.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
You know what I'm sayin'?

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
They said, you know,
I was giving away our position

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Just a pool of sweat
around your ankles

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
because of the shit smell.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
That was fine with me,
you know what I'm sayin'.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
and a deep sense
of satisfaction.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
They-- They wanted
to leave me back.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Gimme a minute, Robert.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
And I was like:
"Well, fuck y'all.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
You look like you need
to take five.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
"Y'all go ahead on 'cause
I don't need y'all anyway.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
I'm rich, bitch."

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Mm-hm. Yeah, sure.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
I present to you
the R. Kelly tape.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
The fuck y'all looking at?

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Hey, li'l man.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
I warn you, it is graphic.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Like guns?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Yeah!

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
RILEY:
Yeah!

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
C'mon.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Come on, let's get that drink.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
MAN: Oh. Oh, my...
WOMAN: Oh, my...

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
MAN:
Well, you should definitely see

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
The Passion.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
It's a very important movie.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
MAN 2: No, he didn't.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Couldn't see it.
White Jesus.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Excuse me?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Objection! We can't even
see his face clearly.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Come on, man.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
It's supposed to be
all historically accurate,

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
MAN 2:
Man, he got freckles

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
and everything.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
and they still have
a white man

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
That proves nothing!

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
playin' Jesus?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
That's some old bullshit.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
Young man,
you speak so well.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Hello? Yes, this
is Robert Kelly.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Yes, the singer.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
You want
my Social Security number?

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
Sure,
it's 916-34-7865.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
RUCKUS:
Well,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
la-di-da-di-do.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
Look like we got us
the winner

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
Okay. God bless.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
of the Lucky-Nigga-of-the-Year
award.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Well, um...

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Ah.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Now, young lady,

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
They must think
the sun shine out your ass.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
I know this might be hard
to talk about.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
No, it's cool.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
Mr. Wuncler's
been very nice, yes.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
How old were you when
you were seeing Mr. Kelly?

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
They must think you
Sidney fucking Poitier.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Mm, 14 and a quarter.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Well,

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
Wow. That's a great age,
isn't it?

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
I been workin'
for Mr. Wuncler for 20 years.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
Still learning so much
about the world.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
I ain't never got invited
to the party.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
Shoot, he don't even let me
use the front door.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Whatever.
I guess.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
Could you describe
the events leading up

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
But you wouldn't know
about that,

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
now, would ya, Mr. Tibbs?

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
to the shooting
of the video?

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Yeah. He asked
if he could pee on me,

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
and I said, "Fo' sho'."

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Oh, yeah.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
I mean, it's R. Kelly,
the Pied Piper of R & B.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
They must think
your shit smell

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
like spring daisies
and cinnamon.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
I been peed on by guys that
don't even have record deals.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Shit, if I didn't want
to get peed on,

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Check this out.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
I'd just move out the way.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Wow.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
RILEY: Ha! I told you!

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
Are those real?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Order!

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Would you describe yourself

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Real?

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
as an African-American woman?

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Put it this way:

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
if I pick one up
and put it to your face,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Nigga, you blind?

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
pull the trigger,
will you be dead?

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
No, I'm not.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
So it's safe to say
that R. Kelly is...

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
sexually attracted
to black women, right?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
HUEY:
And all I'm saying is,

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Mm-hm.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Ronald Reagan was the devil.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Objection, relevance!

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
You are such
an articulate young man.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
Your Honor, I'm trying
to establish to the court

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
that my client
is a proud black man

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
I'm tryin' to explain to you

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
that Ronald Reagan was
the devil.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
who loves his black sistas,

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Ronald Wilson Reagan.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Each of his names
has six letters.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
unlike District Attorney DuBois,

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Six-six-six.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
who's married...

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Man, doesn't
that offend you?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
to a white woman!

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
I love this kid.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Stop that.
What are you doin'?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Stop clappin'.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Damn.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Having a good time, Robert?

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
I-It's, uh...

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Come on,
have a drink with me.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Now, I've listened
to your black ass

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
You look nervous.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
talk all day about how much
you can't stand black folks.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
Do I make you nervous,
Free-man?

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Ain't two of 'em
in the history of the world

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
that's worth
a squirrel fart.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Nervous? No.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Well, how much
you love white folks?

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
I was just, uh, keepin' an eye
out for the boys.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
Best thing the good Lord
ever did for the planet Earth.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
This is a lovely party.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Ruckus, you black
as the ace of spades, man.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
The only joy
I get from these parties

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
I don't see the need for you
to go and insult a man

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
is standing around,
telling mean-spirited jokes

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
after a game of Checkers.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
We been reminiscin' all day,
lookin' in each other's eyes,

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
at other people's expense.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
I do that too.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
actin' like we like each other.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Check out that guy.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
Now, you gotta go ahead
and remind me of my ailment.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
Why is his face
all twisted up like that?

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Ailment?
That's right.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
You heard of vitiligo?

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
Looks like he jacks off
with Icy Hot.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
Shoot!
Well, I got re-vitiligo.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
Every year my skin just seem
to get blacker and darker

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
He looks like
he just shit a gerbil.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
and blacker
and then more darker. Huh.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
It's the opposite
of what Michael Jackson got.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
A gerbil.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Lucky bastard.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
Sorry, I'll be right back.

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
Ruckus, how could you possibly
love white people so much?

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
HUEY:
Tell me this,

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
It's easy. Have you
ever looked at 'em?

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
why was all the video recordin'

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
White man is just a joy
to be around.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
of the Pentagon attack
seized by the FBI

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
They smell like lemon juice
and Pledge furniture cleaner.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
and never seen again?

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
He speaks so well.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
He's adorable.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
And look at 'em.
They gave us discipline, jobs,

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Are you even listenin'

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
to what I'm sayin'?

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
put structure in our life,
took us out the jungle.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Nigga, if you ruin
this party for me,

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
I'll put my--
Ruin the party? They love me.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
And what we do
to show our appreciation?

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
These people aren't worried
about us.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
We march up and down the street.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
They're not worried
about anything. They're rich.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
We vote. Carry on.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
No matter what happens,

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Ingrates.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
these people will
just keep applaudin'.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Well, how about this?

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Game.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
: Ahem. Attention please.

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
My name is Uncle Ruckus, no relation.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Nigga.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
ATTORNEY:
I'm going to show you

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
I want to sing y'all a brand
new song I just wrote called:

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
something they don't
want you to see.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
Something that will
blow this case wide open.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
"Don't Trust Them New Niggas
Over There."

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
Sing along
if you know the words.

16:18.000 --> 16:24.000
This is R. Kelly's NAACP Image
Award Certificate of Nomination.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Hey, man,

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
Over there

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
you got his card?

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
He's good.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
In the air

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Did you wash
your hands?

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
You think they nominate
just anyone

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
Nappy-head niggas

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
for this award?
MAN: I got one!

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
You know why he wants
to put R. Kelly in jail?

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
MAN: Why?
Because he's

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
afraid of R. Kelly.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
Over there

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
MAN: Oh.
Objection!

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Shhh! Would you be quiet?

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
Are you sure that vest'll stop
this shotgun?

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
MAN: Shush.
I think he's afraid.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I think the whole system
is afraid of R. Kelly.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
Man, I'm like the Terminator
in this vest.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Your Honor, please!

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
If you don't shut up--

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
They're afraid because
they see the power for good

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
RUCKUS:

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
that this man wields
through his music.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
What? You don't believe me?

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Yes, they do.
MAN: Mm-hm.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Go ahead!

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
They don't want
R. Kelly to be free

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Pull the trigger.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
because they don't want you
to be free!

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Now, are you sure that--?

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
They don't want me to be free!

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
I said pull that trigger now!

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
You wanna play rough?

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
Maybe R. Kelly did urinate
on this woman.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Okay.

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
Over yonder

17:10.000 --> 17:15.000
But America urinated
on R. Kelly!

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
It'll make you wonder

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
MAN:
Oh!

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
Nigga-figures

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
MAN: Tell 'em!
MAN 2: He got framed!

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
And if you let them
put this man in jail,

17:25.000 --> 17:31.000
America will urinate
on each and every one of you!

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Assalamu'alaikum.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
ALL: Wa alaikum assalam.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
I think the N-word is okay,
as long as they say it.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
MAN 2:
Brother.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
Please, people.
You saw the tape.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
See?

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
The girl testified
she was underage.

17:41.000 --> 17:46.000
You-- You're not allowed
to do that to a little girl!

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Say hello to my little friend.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
We have a videotape!

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Go tell that
to your white bitch.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Mmm-hmm.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
But the girl was...

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
Fuck y'all lookin' at?

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Prosecution rests.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
all that needs to be said
is this:

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
MAN:
Aw, yeah!

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Hey, you think we in trouble?

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
You shot his grandson
out the window.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
We're meant to be together

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
What you think?

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
I don't know.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
I didn't want to move here,

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
Let it go

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
but I don't really want Granddad
to lose his house.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
He worked his whole life
to get here.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
MAN: Hey!

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
Man, I like that house.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
Oh, well,
I shot a nigga!

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
Every famous nigga that gets
arrested is not Nelson Mandela!

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Mr. Wuncler,

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Yes, the government conspires

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
I'm...sorry about
the whole, you know,

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
to put a lot
of innocent black men in jail

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
on fallacious charges,

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
my grandson shooting
your grandson

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
but R. Kelly
is not one of those men!

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
out of the window thing.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
We all know the nigga can sing,
but what happened to standards?

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Are you mad?

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
In 30 years,

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
What happened to bare minimums?

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
that boy will be the president
of the United States.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
You a fan of R. Kelly?

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
You wanna help R. Kelly?

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
And he'll still
be a fucking idiot.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Then get some counseling
for R. Kelly!

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
Introduce him
to some older women.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Whew.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Now, are we gonna have
that drink or what?

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Hide his camcorder.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
But don't pretend
like the man is a hero!

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Glad you were able
to make it, Robert.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
To the old school.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
And stop the damn dancin'!

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
To the old school.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
Act like you got
some goddamn sense, people!

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Damn!

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Through playin' around here!

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
RILEY:
Boooooo!

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Hey, you with the Afro!

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Give it a rest! Beat it!

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Put the music back on!

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
HUEY: I did battle

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
with ignorance today,

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
and ignorance won.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
I admit that I'm often...

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
vexed at the behavior of my own people.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
Yeah, "vexed" is a good word.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
I told you about messin'
with them white women.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
HUEY: You do what you can

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
to help black folks,

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
and they make you wonder why you even bother.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
But they're our people,

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
and we gotta love 'em regardless.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
WOMAN:
Break it down!

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
HUEY: One thing for sure, though.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.000
Can't blame this one on the white man.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
What am I saying?

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
Of course I can.
