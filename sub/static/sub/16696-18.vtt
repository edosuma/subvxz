I'M NOT GONNA STOP BUYING STUFF
FOR YOUR KIDS, THOUGH.

19:50.167 --> 19:52.801
NO, NO, I WANT YOU
TO KEEP DOING THAT.

19:52.868 --> 19:55.200
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY REALLY WANT?

19:55.267 --> 19:56.667
I HEARD THEM TALKING.

19:56.734 --> 19:58.167
WHAT?

19:58.234 --> 20:01.501
THAT DIRECTV WITH
THE SPORTS PACKAGE.

20:01.567 --> 20:02.534
REALLY?

20:02.601 --> 20:05.734
RUBY HAS BEEN CHATTERING
ABOUT IT.

20:05.801 --> 20:09.267
SOMETHING ABOUT
INTERNATIONAL SOCCER.

20:09.334 --> 20:11.934
SO ARE WE OKAY?

20:12.000 --> 20:13.367
YEAH.

20:13.434 --> 20:14.667
SHOULD WE HUG?

20:14.734 --> 20:15.667
NO.

20:15.734 --> 20:17.167
OKAY.

20:17.234 --> 20:18.801
WHEW!

20:18.868 --> 20:21.834
LISTEN, THE MURAL?
I WANT TO PAY FOR IT.

20:21.901 --> 20:26.234
BUT BETWEEN THE STEAK DINNER
AND THE DONKEY/PONY...

20:28.167 --> 20:30.167
I'M JUST A LITTLE
TAPPED OUT RIGHT NOW.

20:30.234 --> 20:31.701
OH, THAT'S OKAY.
I CAN AFFORD IT.

20:31.767 --> 20:32.868
I MAKE MORE MONEY
THAN YOU.

20:32.934 --> 20:35.267
[ LAUGHS ]

20:35.334 --> 20:36.267
OH, COME ON.

20:36.334 --> 20:38.501
I DIDN'T SAY IT
IN FRONT OF ANYONE.

20:38.567 --> 20:41.033
I WAS THIS CLOSE
TO HUGGING YOU.

20:41.100 --> 20:43.701
Andy: HEY, YOU GUYS?
YOU GOTTA CHECK THIS OUT.

20:43.767 --> 20:44.801
OH, BOY.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.200
HA HA HA HA!

20:46.267 --> 20:47.567
COME HERE.

20:47.634 --> 20:50.267
OH, YEAH, YOU LIKE THAT?

20:50.334 --> 20:54.100
I LOVE YOU, ANDY.

20:54.167 --> 20:56.300
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

20:56.367 --> 20:59.033
[ SMOOCHS ]

21:00.901 --> 21:03.133
HE REALLY NEEDS
TO FIND A GIRLFRIEND.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.133
I THINK HE JUST DID.
