00:38.520 --> 00:40.359
- It's one dish.

00:40.360 --> 00:41.639
- One dish?

00:41.640 --> 00:44.759
Okay, are you blind or
just legally retarded?

00:44.760 --> 00:48.239
- There is one dish in
that sink that I put there.

00:48.240 --> 00:49.366
- Really, Ben?
- And you're,

00:49.367 --> 00:51.839
happen to be quite the
dish Nazi, I might add.

00:51.840 --> 00:53.762
When did you, everything is like,

00:53.763 --> 00:55.279
this is not clean enough.

00:55.280 --> 00:56.805
There's smudges on this plate.
- Don't do that.

00:56.806 --> 00:57.919
Stop doing that.

00:57.920 --> 00:59.565
For sure, stop doing that.

00:59.566 --> 01:00.886
It's super offensive.

01:00.887 --> 01:03.643
'Cause I come from a long
line of Holocaust survivors.

01:03.644 --> 01:05.999
- How could there be a long
line of Holocaust survivors?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.239
There's only one or two generations

01:07.240 --> 01:08.999
that were in the Holocaust.

01:09.000 --> 01:09.840
- You're gonna tell me

01:09.841 --> 01:11.124
that there's one dish...
- Did you call me...

01:11.125 --> 01:12.565
- In this sink?
- Legally retarded before?

01:12.566 --> 01:16.039
It's so insensitive, it's so insensitive.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.119
Okay.
- I'm not doing this.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.406
- Could you imagine if my aunt was here?

01:18.407 --> 01:20.879
For someone that has
claimed to be offended

01:20.880 --> 01:22.959
by conversation recently...
- Grow up.

01:22.960 --> 01:23.800
- The word retarded
- I can't...

01:23.801 --> 01:25.290
- Is so offensive.
- Fucking deal with you.

01:25.280 --> 01:26.611
- Yeah, the are more...
- Honestly, Ben.

01:26.600 --> 01:27.485
- There's more than one dish...
- Grow the fuck up.

01:27.486 --> 01:28.286
- This time.

01:28.287 --> 01:29.805
- But you did say retarded.
- Like, seriously?

01:29.806 --> 01:31.245
- And that is so hard to hear.

01:31.246 --> 01:33.049
- How many years, Ben?

01:33.960 --> 01:35.961
How many years, no.
- Particularly in the last 10

01:35.962 --> 01:37.199
have people really started

01:37.200 --> 01:38.770
to take offense to that word.
- How many years have I been

01:38.760 --> 01:39.964
asking you to do the fucking dishes?

01:39.965 --> 01:40.927
And it just still has to be

01:40.928 --> 01:43.079
this cat and mouse game...
- Well, how many years...

01:43.080 --> 01:44.045
- Where you force me...
- Have I been asking you...

01:44.046 --> 01:45.005
- To be the nag?
- To give me

01:45.006 --> 01:46.079
a blowjob every once in awhile?

01:46.080 --> 01:46.886
I can't even remember

01:46.887 --> 01:47.800
the last time.
- A blowjob?

01:47.801 --> 01:48.685
- Would it kill you?

01:48.686 --> 01:49.600
- Okay, how about this.

01:49.601 --> 01:50.440
I've got a solution.

01:50.441 --> 01:52.124
I'll do the dishes, and you
can go suck your own dick.

01:52.125 --> 01:53.479
- Fuck you.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.162
- Fuck me?
- Seriously, just fuck you.

01:55.163 --> 01:56.571
- Fuck you.
- It's so...

01:56.572 --> 01:58.279
- Fuck you.

01:58.280 --> 02:00.479
Fuck you, fuck you.

02:00.480 --> 02:03.006
<i>♫ Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you</i>

02:03.007 --> 02:05.207
♫ Fuck you

02:12.760 --> 02:14.119
- Oh shit, I gotta call my mom.

02:14.120 --> 02:15.119
- No.

02:15.120 --> 02:16.531
Please, please, please.
- I have to call her back.

02:16.520 --> 02:17.485
- I literally...
- She's called me...

02:17.486 --> 02:18.604
- I will throw my body...
- Three times this week...

02:18.605 --> 02:19.440
- Out of this car.
- And I have not

02:19.441 --> 02:20.280
called her back.

02:20.281 --> 02:21.120
I have to call her back.
- I'll do anything.

02:21.121 --> 02:22.884
Tell me, tell me, a blowjob.

02:22.885 --> 02:23.961
Hang up, blowjob.

02:23.962 --> 02:25.039
I swear to you.

02:25.040 --> 02:25.846
Blowjob right now.
- Don't fuck me up.

02:25.847 --> 02:26.887
- Don't fuck me up.
- Right now, right...

02:26.888 --> 02:28.159
- Hello?
- Hi mom.

02:28.160 --> 02:29.605
- Hi sweetie, how are ya?

02:29.606 --> 02:31.279
- I'm good, I'm driving.

02:31.280 --> 02:33.042
- Sherry Orlofski's son was driving

02:33.043 --> 02:35.479
holding a cellphone, got hit by a bus.

02:35.480 --> 02:36.811
He's paralyzed from the waist down.

02:36.812 --> 02:38.126
He shits in a bag now.

02:38.127 --> 02:39.690
- I don't know who Sherry Orlofski is.

02:39.691 --> 02:42.279
I don't know why this is like,

02:42.280 --> 02:43.919
what's going on?

02:43.920 --> 02:45.326
- She's in my book club.

02:45.327 --> 02:46.359
Are you with Anna?

02:46.360 --> 02:47.202
- Yes.

02:47.203 --> 02:49.643
No, no, I mean I'm
spiritually always with Anna,

02:49.644 --> 02:51.399
but no, I am not with Anna.

02:51.400 --> 02:52.445
- Okay, 'cause if she's not there,

02:52.446 --> 02:54.124
there's something I need
to talk to you about.

02:54.125 --> 02:56.799
- Uh, is everything okay?

02:56.800 --> 02:58.609
- Honey, you gotta make me a baby.

02:58.610 --> 02:59.799
- Mom.

02:59.800 --> 03:02.164
- All my friends
have grandkids, Benny.

03:02.165 --> 03:05.448
Everyone at book club's passing
out photos like it's 9-11.

03:05.449 --> 03:08.079
- That is such a weird analogy to use.

03:08.080 --> 03:09.969
- Yeah, but just gimme
a little grandbaby, honey.

03:09.970 --> 03:11.319
I know it's scary.

03:11.320 --> 03:12.559
I know it is.
- Okay.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.085
- But you think I was ready for you?

03:14.086 --> 03:15.923
I pooped you out like a dog in summer,

03:15.924 --> 03:17.839
and I never regretted it.

03:17.840 --> 03:18.646
All right, I gotta go.

03:18.647 --> 03:19.480
I got a client.

03:19.481 --> 03:20.322
Love you so much, all right.

03:20.323 --> 03:21.679
Okay, okay?
- Okay.

03:21.680 --> 03:23.125
- Okay.
- Love you.

03:26.560 --> 03:29.279
- Did you not tell her?

03:29.280 --> 03:30.120
- No.

03:30.121 --> 03:31.087
I mean.

03:31.088 --> 03:32.525
- No, you didn't tell her?

03:32.526 --> 03:33.759
- No, I did, 1...

03:33.760 --> 03:37.319
- You told me a year
ago when I told my parents,

03:37.320 --> 03:38.481
you said that you told her.

03:38.482 --> 03:40.359
- Look, you know my mom is crazy, right?

03:40.360 --> 03:41.247
You know that, okay.

03:41.248 --> 03:43.159
And if I had told her what happened...

03:43.160 --> 03:43.968
- So you lied?

03:43.969 --> 03:45.371
- I didn't lie, I just,

03:45.372 --> 03:47.559
my mom gives me so much anxiety.

03:47.560 --> 03:51.039
About my life and my job, and you.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.040
- About me?

03:53.640 --> 03:57.439
Why does she give you anxiety about me?

03:57.440 --> 04:00.091
- You know, 'cause you're older.

04:01.800 --> 04:02.800
- I'm older?

04:04.000 --> 04:04.840
- Well, I mean...

04:04.841 --> 04:05.727
- Older?

04:05.728 --> 04:06.999
- Well...

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
- What the...

04:13.680 --> 04:16.999
- Well, I think she should say it.

04:17.000 --> 04:17.839
- I'm not saying it.

04:17.841 --> 04:18.760
- Well, I'm not saying it.

04:18.761 --> 04:19.805
Does it even need to be said

04:19.805 --> 04:21.004
or is it just kind of
a thing that's like...

04:21.005 --> 04:22.045
- Yes, you should say sorry.

04:22.046 --> 04:22.882
- Why?

04:22.883 --> 04:24.642
I mean, you should say sorry to me.

04:24.643 --> 04:26.079
- What would I say sorry for?

04:26.080 --> 04:27.366
- For calling me a liar.
- You lied.

04:27.367 --> 04:28.803
- You know what, I did,

04:28.804 --> 04:30.370
whatever I did, I did for you.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.079
- Oh my god,

04:32.080 --> 04:33.809
What are we, in a Bryan Adams song?

04:33.810 --> 04:35.799
- Oh my, that is so,

04:35.800 --> 04:37.199
you can't even talk to someone

04:37.200 --> 04:38.167
when they're just like...
- Okay, can I give you

04:38.168 --> 04:39.639
a piece of advice?

04:39.640 --> 04:41.801
- Yeah, I mean, that's what you're...

04:41.802 --> 04:44.087
- That is the arrangement.
- That's why we're here.

04:44.088 --> 04:47.839
- You're both clearly in a lot of pain.

04:47.840 --> 04:51.559
Your frustrations with your
own lives, your careers,

04:51.560 --> 04:53.324
your frustrations with each other.

04:53.325 --> 04:57.159
And though these issues may seem trivial,

04:57.160 --> 04:59.039
they need to be addressed.

04:59.040 --> 05:02.283
Because, oddly, they may be the gateway

05:04.040 --> 05:06.088
to processing your grief.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.521
What I'm looking for is a
way to address these things

05:09.522 --> 05:13.799
without the two of you
getting into the same fight

05:13.800 --> 05:15.450
over and over again.

05:25.040 --> 05:26.719
Okay.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.079
Well, time's up.

05:28.080 --> 05:30.447
And um, I'm moving to Canada.

05:40.480 --> 05:41.679
- I mean.

05:41.680 --> 05:42.679
- I mean.

05:42.680 --> 05:44.282
- Can we thank your godmother for coming?

05:44.283 --> 05:45.247
Say thank you.

05:46.400 --> 05:47.285
- Yeah, that's close.
- That's what we're gonna get.

05:47.286 --> 05:48.930
- That was close.
- That's what we're gonna get.

05:48.931 --> 05:51.491
- Happy birthday, Theo.
- Go play with your friends.

05:54.560 --> 05:55.447
- Cute.

05:55.448 --> 05:57.039
- How are you doin'?

05:57.040 --> 05:59.159
<i>'</i> Yep, I'm good.

05:59.160 --> 06:00.683
- On a scale of one to Snoop Lion,

06:00.684 --> 06:01.959
how high are you right now?

06:01.960 --> 06:02.960
- Um.

06:04.560 --> 06:05.560
Like 100.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.999
- Very good.

06:10.160 --> 06:11.241
Well, even in that state,

06:11.242 --> 06:12.922
I'm very happy that you could be here.

06:12.923 --> 06:15.287
- Only in this state could I be here.

06:16.640 --> 06:17.482
I'm sorry.

06:17.483 --> 06:20.119
No, I'm so happy to be here.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.722
- Yeah, she wanted a music party.

06:21.723 --> 06:22.839
It's for the children.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.251
You know, so the children
could play music.

06:24.240 --> 06:25.080
- It's really nice.

06:25.081 --> 06:26.045
- Yeah, no, it's great.

06:26.046 --> 06:27.644
It's good for them to express themselves.

06:29.240 --> 06:30.048
Yeah.

06:31.088 --> 06:32.241
Yeah, no, he's

06:34.120 --> 06:34.928
my best friend.

06:34.929 --> 06:36.490
- You guys seem really connected.

06:37.760 --> 06:38.727
- You know, but if the whole thing

06:38.728 --> 06:41.919
becomes a little much for you,

06:41.920 --> 06:44.239
why don't we come up with a safe word.

06:44.240 --> 06:45.240
- Okay.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.839
Cup of noodles.

06:48.840 --> 06:49.648
- Is that a request

06:49.649 --> 06:52.286
or is that the...
- Oh, computer planet.

06:52.287 --> 06:54.926
- How about something
less like a creepy robot?

06:54.927 --> 06:57.039
Just use, like a word...
- Okay.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.690
- That would make sense...
- Like a human word.

06:58.680 --> 06:59.522
- At a Party-
- Okay-

06:59.523 --> 07:00.959
- Like pizza.

07:00.960 --> 07:02.679
- Pizza.
- Pizza.

07:02.680 --> 07:04.284
- And this is our daughter Isis.

07:04.285 --> 07:05.519
- Yeah.

07:05.520 --> 07:06.879
- What, I'm sorry?

07:06.880 --> 07:08.765
- Yeah, we get it.
- Yeah, it's, um.

07:08.766 --> 07:10.485
Before the...
- She was named

07:10.486 --> 07:12.479
after the Egyptian goddess of magic.

07:12.480 --> 07:14.164
It was before the...
- Yeah, before the cell

07:14.165 --> 07:15.885
of the international jihadi terror thing.

07:15.886 --> 07:18.087
- But I didn't hear you guys
wrong, her name is Isis?

07:18.088 --> 07:20.199
- Yeah, Isis Ellen Greenburg.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.403
- Isis Ellen Greenburg.

07:21.404 --> 07:22.686
- Isn't that beautiful?

07:22.687 --> 07:24.330
- First Jew in Isis.

07:25.960 --> 07:28.439
- There's absolutely no way
that I am having another baby.

07:28.440 --> 07:30.568
Meanwhile, Candice is
on baby number three.

07:30.569 --> 07:32.079
- I know, look at her.

07:32.080 --> 07:35.843
- She loves motherhood so much,
she should fuckin' marry it.

07:35.844 --> 07:37.279
- Congratulations on your TV show.

07:37.280 --> 07:38.086
- Thank you.

07:38.087 --> 07:39.127
I'm pretty psyched about it.

07:39.128 --> 07:40.879
I wasn't really looking to run a show,

07:40.880 --> 07:42.041
and it just kind of happened.

07:42.042 --> 07:44.519
And it's really cool.
- Yeah.

07:44.520 --> 07:45.759
- You hungry?

07:45.760 --> 07:47.171
Do you want the milks?

07:47.172 --> 07:48.599
Yeah?
- The milks?

07:48.600 --> 07:50.039
- You want the milks?

07:50.040 --> 07:52.479
Oh yeah, you do, look
at you reachin' for it.

07:52.480 --> 07:53.480
- Okay.

07:54.320 --> 07:57.359
- This guy is just dry as a desert today.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.039
- Oh my god.

07:59.040 --> 08:01.799
- It's just nice getting
paid doing something you love

08:01.800 --> 08:02.722
for a living, you know?

08:02.723 --> 08:03.801
It's great.
- Uh-huh.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.160
- I just saw Ben.

08:08.161 --> 08:09.002
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

08:09.003 --> 08:10.490
You guys are so cute.
- Thanks.

08:10.491 --> 08:15.399
- When are you guys gonna
make one of these things?

08:15.400 --> 08:16.242
- What was the word?

08:16.243 --> 08:17.599
I forgot the word.

08:17.600 --> 08:18.959
- Pizza.
- Pizza, pizza.

08:18.960 --> 08:19.925
- Yeah.
- Pizza?

08:19.926 --> 08:21.204
- We heard the pizza guy just came.

08:21.205 --> 08:22.167
- Oh, okay.
- So we're just gonna go

08:22.168 --> 08:23.479
grab the pizza.
- Okay, cool.

08:23.480 --> 08:24.288
- Okay.
- All right.

08:24.289 --> 08:25.879
- Come on.

08:25.880 --> 08:26.722
- It was so crazy.

08:26.723 --> 08:29.239
She just took her boob out.

08:29.240 --> 08:30.919
Right there.

08:30.920 --> 08:31.760
It's fucked up.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.967
'Cause I'm not supposed to
think about your friends' boobs.

08:33.967 --> 08:36.530
But now everyone's got kids
and they're breastfeeding.

08:36.532 --> 08:39.318
It's like...
- It's so culty.

08:39.320 --> 08:40.726
- Hello, how you doing?

08:40.727 --> 08:42.245
I'm Anna's friend's boob.

08:42.246 --> 08:43.525
Nice to meet ya.

08:48.600 --> 08:49.600
You Okay?

08:52.880 --> 08:57.279
'Cause I really didn't
see much of her boob.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.122
- Okay, I know.

08:58.123 --> 08:59.685
- If that's why I'm making you upset.

08:59.686 --> 09:01.648
I mean, it was big, but it was not,

09:01.649 --> 09:04.007
you know, it had clearly been

09:05.200 --> 09:06.200
ravaged.

09:14.040 --> 09:16.520
I knew we shouldn't have come.

09:18.640 --> 09:19.640
- I know.

09:22.040 --> 09:23.839
Like, I have to come to these things.

09:23.840 --> 09:24.839
Like, what am I gonna do?

09:24.840 --> 09:25.762
She's my best friend.

09:25.763 --> 09:28.001
Like, I can't just not come

09:29.240 --> 09:33.131
to my godson's first
birthday party 'cause I...

09:39.840 --> 09:41.763
I just, it always makes me think.

09:41.764 --> 09:43.364
Like, were we crazy?

09:44.760 --> 09:46.569
'Cause look at us.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.451
- What's that supposed to mean?

09:54.080 --> 09:57.439
What, I mean, we have
shitty jobs to pay the rent.

09:57.440 --> 09:59.283
Because that's what you
do when you're an adult.

09:59.284 --> 10:01.159
And it's shitty.

10:01.160 --> 10:02.799
- I had a book deal.

10:02.800 --> 10:03.642
- I know.

10:03.643 --> 10:06.439
- I was the star of my class.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.519
And Candice was a shit writer in college.

10:08.520 --> 10:09.759
- Don't compare yourself...
- I mean, she was

10:09.760 --> 10:10.602
a fucking joke.

10:10.603 --> 10:14.519
- Well, now Candice with
the boobs is a show runner.

10:14.520 --> 10:17.126
She's being paid to do
something she loves.

10:17.127 --> 10:20.479
That's more than you
could say about me or you.

10:20.480 --> 10:21.719
- You were an artist.

10:21.720 --> 10:22.846
- Well, art...
- You know, you...

10:22.847 --> 10:24.399
- Anna.

10:24.400 --> 10:25.240
- Like, you...
- You know...

10:25.241 --> 10:26.207
- Had dreams, too.
- What I've come to realize?

10:26.208 --> 10:28.039
Art is bullshit.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.799
That's what I've, that's my big takeaway.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.450
Can I have a lighter, please?
- Art is bullshit?

10:32.451 --> 10:34.119
- Art is bullshit.

10:34.120 --> 10:36.930
- Wow, that's a choice philosophy.

10:38.280 --> 10:39.770
You know who else
thought art was bullshit?

10:39.760 --> 10:41.044
Hitler.
- Why does it always have to

10:41.045 --> 10:42.563
come back to the Holocaust?
- Because we should never forget.

10:42.564 --> 10:43.480
- We will never, trust me,

10:43.481 --> 10:44.684
we will never forget.
- No, we will never forget.

10:44.685 --> 10:45.520
- No, we won't.
- Because I bring it up

10:45.521 --> 10:46.362
to remind us.

10:46.363 --> 10:47.566
- All the time.

10:57.160 --> 10:58.002
- Really?

10:58.003 --> 10:59.559
One second.

10:59.560 --> 11:03.039
Should we open a window or something?

11:03.040 --> 11:05.247
- No, it's fine, they know.

11:06.160 --> 11:09.285
They actually have a lot
of good instruments here.

11:09.286 --> 11:11.122
- I can't find a bass, though.

11:11.123 --> 11:14.042
- Well, yeah, no kid wants
to grow up to play bass.

11:14.043 --> 11:15.371
They just end up playing bass.

11:15.372 --> 11:16.479
- Why?

11:16.480 --> 11:18.799
- Because it's like.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.239
- I play bass.

11:20.240 --> 11:22.321
- Look at this cool little kid guitar.

11:22.322 --> 11:25.403
That sounds pretty good.

11:25.404 --> 11:27.919
- One, two, three, four.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.359
- Did she just count us in?
- Mm-hmm.

11:30.360 --> 11:31.327
- Who is that?

11:31.328 --> 11:32.959
- I don't know.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.799
I think it's Isis.

11:34.800 --> 11:35.642
- What is it?

11:35.643 --> 11:37.919
- Her name is Isis.

11:37.920 --> 11:38.887
- Oh.

11:38.888 --> 11:40.405
- She's a real firecracker.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.039
- Hmm.

11:44.040 --> 11:45.039
Okay.

11:45.040 --> 11:47.119
♫ You and I

11:47.120 --> 11:49.239
♫ I, I, I, I, I

11:49.240 --> 11:50.080
- I like that.

11:50.081 --> 11:50.920
- Yeah?

11:50.921 --> 11:51.921
- Okay.

11:52.640 --> 11:54.759
♫ We can fight

11:54.760 --> 11:58.439
<i>♫ Fight, fight, fight, fight</i>

11:58.440 --> 11:59.679
- Hey, I think you
got your first groupie.

11:59.680 --> 12:00.522
- Yeah.

12:00.523 --> 12:02.679
♫ Try, we must

12:02.680 --> 12:04.250
♫ Try, try, try, try, try

12:04.251 --> 12:07.079
♫ To find the light

12:07.080 --> 12:08.439
♫ Light, light, light

12:08.440 --> 12:09.440
Now bridge.

12:10.280 --> 12:11.280
- Okay.

12:12.720 --> 12:15.451
♫ Find the fight

12:16.760 --> 12:19.959
♫ Day and night

12:19.960 --> 12:21.959

12:24.840 --> 12:27.279
Oh shit, I gotta get tambo on it.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.759
- And you gotta stop cursing
in front of the kids.

12:35.200 --> 12:36.559
Nice.

12:36.560 --> 12:38.199
Really good job.

12:38.200 --> 12:40.123
Really good job.
- You, too, up high.

12:40.124 --> 12:41.639
- Really good job.

13:06.360 --> 13:07.559
Ben-

13:07.560 --> 13:08.560
- Hmm?

13:14.680 --> 13:15.806
- Where, um...

13:20.200 --> 13:23.090
Where do you think we go from here?

13:28.840 --> 13:30.046
- I don't know.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.839
- I think I thought that

13:36.840 --> 13:39.320
having a kid would just, like,

13:41.520 --> 13:42.726
fix everything.

13:50.640 --> 13:53.530
Like, I just wanna create something

13:54.840 --> 13:57.999
with some kind of meaning, you know.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.571
Like, I just wanna find fucking

14:03.680 --> 14:05.409
meaning in something.

14:07.520 --> 14:08.520
- Well,

14:12.480 --> 14:15.639
I don't know what to tell you.

14:15.640 --> 14:18.959
It feels like we're both just stuck.

14:18.960 --> 14:22.839
And that leads to anger, and
then that leads to fighting.

14:22.840 --> 14:24.046
- Yeah, I know.

14:25.840 --> 14:26.840
I know.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.199
And then we just fight.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.771
- We fight so much.
- All the fuckin' time.

14:31.772 --> 14:33.285
It's such a bummer.

14:35.160 --> 14:37.367
- Yesterday was good.

14:40.120 --> 14:41.326
- It was, yeah.

14:43.760 --> 14:46.319
I felt kind of bad that we, um...

14:46.320 --> 14:47.651
- Stole that kid's thunder.
- We hijacked

14:47.652 --> 14:49.279
that kid's party.

14:49.280 --> 14:53.046
- Yeah, that will fuck
him up for a long time.

14:54.440 --> 14:55.771
But at least we weren't fighting.

14:59.760 --> 15:02.399
- It was fun singing there though.

15:09.200 --> 15:12.841
What if we turned all
our fights into songs?

15:17.160 --> 15:18.160
- Okay.

15:21.840 --> 15:23.285
- No, I'm serious.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.119
Let's start a band.

15:33.923 --> 15:35.570
<i>fl</i> Hey, hey, hey, hey

15:37.400 --> 15:39.209
- There's so many
yarmulkes from our wedding.

15:39.210 --> 15:40.479
- I know.

15:40.480 --> 15:43.079
- Did anyone even wear a yarmulke?

15:43.080 --> 15:44.125
- Everyone wore a yarmulke.

15:44.126 --> 15:44.962
- We have so many left over.

15:44.963 --> 15:46.359
What is this?

15:46.360 --> 15:48.408
- Oh, that's my Armageddon suitcase.

15:48.409 --> 15:49.639
Oh yeah, big time.

15:49.640 --> 15:50.562
There's a lot in there.

15:50.563 --> 15:52.767
There's a couple bottles of Xanax.

15:52.768 --> 15:54.839
There's $1,000 hard cash.

15:54.840 --> 15:58.359
And then, yeah, Bed Bath
& Beyond coupons for days.

15:58.360 --> 15:59.361
- I love that in your mind,

15:59.362 --> 16:02.330
the zombie apocalypse still
focuses around Bed Bath.

16:02.331 --> 16:04.519
- Yeah, that's the epicenter.

16:04.520 --> 16:06.963
- And we're gonna need to get 20% off.

16:06.964 --> 16:08.722
- No, but, oh my god, you're so literal.

16:08.723 --> 16:10.370
You're not using them as coupons.

16:10.371 --> 16:12.879
You're using them as currency.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.599
You know, to barter.

16:14.600 --> 16:15.839
You trade for weapons,

16:15.840 --> 16:16.682
Brita filters.
- Yeah, I was being

16:16.683 --> 16:18.439
really literal.
- Body pillows, whatever.

16:18.440 --> 16:19.521
Whatever you need.
- It's my fault.

16:19.522 --> 16:21.362
Hey, hey, hey, hey, look what I found.

16:21.363 --> 16:22.359
<i>'</i> Oh!

16:22.360 --> 16:23.360
Oh my god.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.200
Oh my god.

16:26.640 --> 16:30.201
- I have not played
this since high school.

16:34.760 --> 16:35.799
- She pretty.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.959
- Yeah, she fine.

16:37.960 --> 16:38.999
Check her out.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
- Whoa.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.449
I don't want you to hurt your neck.

16:49.450 --> 16:51.799
- Sounds great, neighbor.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.479
- Hey Dave.
- Hi Dave.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.003
- Is that John Mayer over there?

16:55.004 --> 16:56.239
- Aw, heck no.
- No.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.603
I just found my old guitar

16:57.604 --> 16:58.681
from high school.
- Yeah.

16:58.682 --> 16:59.681
- Are you John Mayer?

16:59.682 --> 17:01.245
- Right, yeah.

17:01.246 --> 17:04.125
Second time's a charm.
- Second time, yeah.

17:04.126 --> 17:05.406
- What are you doing?

17:05.406 --> 17:07.959
- We're cleanin' out the garage

17:07.960 --> 17:09.246
to make it a rehearsal space.

17:09.247 --> 17:10.959
We're starting a band.

17:10.960 --> 17:11.800
- For a band?

17:11.800 --> 17:12.800
- Yeah.

17:12.801 --> 17:15.199
- I used to play drums in high school.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.040
- Cool.
- Yeah.

17:16.040 --> 17:16.882
- Really?

17:16.883 --> 17:17.924
- I was in a band myself.

17:17.925 --> 17:19.159
- Oh yeah, what was it called?

17:19.160 --> 17:20.286
- The band was called Myself.

17:20.287 --> 17:23.598
It was a sort of solo percussive group.

17:23.599 --> 17:26.358
You know, djembe and the rumba.

17:26.359 --> 17:28.169
Conga, bongo, timbale.

17:29.360 --> 17:31.479
You know, just like, yeah.

17:31.480 --> 17:33.285
- And you played all of those yourself?

17:33.286 --> 17:35.119
- I played all of them myself.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.042
- Wow.
- Yeah.

17:36.043 --> 17:39.719
The Big Fork Daily called
it really, very weird.

17:39.720 --> 17:40.759
- Oh.
- Wow.

17:40.760 --> 17:41.600
- That's great.

17:41.601 --> 17:42.442
- Yeah, well...
- Congrats, man.

17:42.443 --> 17:45.887
That sounds great.
- Yeah, congratulations.

17:51.600 --> 17:52.839
- Okay.

17:52.840 --> 17:54.399
- Cool, Dave.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.559
We'll see ya.
- Yeah.

17:55.560 --> 17:56.891
- See ya around the neighbs.
- Thanks, Dave.

17:56.892 --> 17:59.679
- I'll see you very soon.

17:59.680 --> 18:00.963
Okay, so, we have to move.

18:00.964 --> 18:02.246
- You can't, I know.

18:02.247 --> 18:04.239
- We have to move.

18:04.240 --> 18:07.159
'Cause of that interaction alone.

18:07.160 --> 18:09.399
- Oh, he's 100% gonna murder us.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.042
- Hey Rob.

18:12.043 --> 18:13.963
All right, so here it
is, here's the lowdown.

18:13.964 --> 18:17.359
She was good from far, but far from good.

18:17.360 --> 18:18.839
YES.

18:18.840 --> 18:19.887
She's a little curvy for my taste,

18:19.888 --> 18:21.803
but she still fucked like a champ.

18:21.804 --> 18:24.319
- The only, yeah, the only,

18:24.320 --> 18:25.162
no, I definitely could have

18:25.163 --> 18:27.524
used some Instagram filters
in-between the sheets.

18:27.525 --> 18:29.202
That's such a good idea, though.

18:29.203 --> 18:32.119
Restaurants with the lighting
as Instagram filters.

18:32.120 --> 18:33.121
So you can just say like,

18:33.122 --> 18:35.324
oh, I'll meet you at Valencia at eight,

18:35.325 --> 18:37.641
and then we'll have drinks
afterwards at Hudson.

18:37.642 --> 18:41.439
Well, yeah, that may be a
little saturated, but.

19:16.320 --> 19:17.160
- HEY-

19:17.161 --> 19:18.161
- Hi.

19:19.520 --> 19:20.931
- Were you gonna?

19:22.000 --> 19:22.840
- Was I gonna what?

19:22.841 --> 19:24.001
- I thought, because
you were standing there,

19:24.002 --> 19:26.199
you were gonna open the-

19:26.200 --> 19:27.042
- Oh, get the door?

19:27.043 --> 19:29.850
Oh no, I'm sorry, I don't do that.

19:31.480 --> 19:33.799
- Would have been a nice gesture.

19:51.720 --> 19:53.609
- How long have
you been an Uber driver?

19:53.610 --> 19:54.679
- Like a year.

19:54.680 --> 19:56.639
- Oh, that's crazy.

19:56.640 --> 19:57.482
That's crazy.

19:57.483 --> 19:59.289
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- Yeah.

20:00.280 --> 20:01.202
What'd you do before that?

20:01.203 --> 20:03.521
Before you were an Uber
driver, what'd you do?

20:03.522 --> 20:05.039
- I was a writer.

20:05.040 --> 20:06.040
- Oh, crazy.

20:07.480 --> 20:08.759
I'm single.

20:08.760 --> 20:09.807
' Hmm?

20:10.680 --> 20:12.279
- I'm single.

20:12.280 --> 20:13.520
- That's crazy.

20:20.040 --> 20:20.880
- Hi.

20:20.881 --> 20:21.881
- HEY-

20:23.960 --> 20:25.439
How was work?

20:25.440 --> 20:26.407
- It was good.

20:26.408 --> 20:28.482
Somebody left their iPad in the back seat.

20:28.483 --> 20:29.559
- Score.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.439
You gonna return it?

20:31.440 --> 20:33.681
- Well, I couldn't really get in it.

20:33.682 --> 20:35.205
It's password protected.

20:35.206 --> 20:36.565
But I don't know.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.089
I was thinking maybe you could keep it,

20:40.090 --> 20:43.959
walk around with it and make
it look like you have a job.

20:43.960 --> 20:45.769
Oh my god, this fuckin' drip.

20:45.770 --> 20:47.639
- I have a job.

20:47.640 --> 20:48.959
- Yeah, no, I know.

20:48.960 --> 20:51.519
I just meant one where, you know,

20:51.520 --> 20:53.043
you might have to wear pants.

20:53.044 --> 20:54.323
- Fair enough.

20:54.324 --> 20:56.084
- Hey, did you finish your logo?

20:56.085 --> 20:58.159
- Yeah, all done.

20:58.160 --> 20:59.160
- Really?

21:00.720 --> 21:04.281
- And I was thinking,
maybe to celebrate...

21:05.440 --> 21:07.599
- Oh, do you wanna?

21:07.600 --> 21:08.719
- Fuck? No.

21:08.720 --> 21:10.210
No, I was thinking maybe
we could order Papa Johns,

21:10.211 --> 21:12.567
maybe jam out Jem and the Holograms style.

21:12.568 --> 21:13.839
- Oh okay, yeah.

21:13.840 --> 21:14.682
Oh yeah.

21:14.683 --> 21:16.559
I just, I wasn't really
in the mood to fuck.

21:16.560 --> 21:17.525
Yeah.
- The sensation I get from sex

21:17.526 --> 21:18.885
and the sensation I get from eating pizza,

21:18.886 --> 21:21.959
it's like, interchangeable
for me at this point.

21:21.960 --> 21:22.960
- WOW, okay'

21:26.080 --> 21:27.445
Okay, let's just,

21:28.400 --> 21:30.241
can we just take the
pressure off a little bit?

21:30.242 --> 21:31.080
- Can I have some ranch?

21:31.081 --> 21:32.081
- Okay.

21:35.640 --> 21:37.205
- Yeah, there we go.
- Oh ho-ho-ho.

21:37.206 --> 21:38.439
That's a sweet bite.

21:38.440 --> 21:39.407
- That's the Tom Petty bite.

21:39.408 --> 21:40.439
- Yeah.

21:40.440 --> 21:41.440
Okay.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.089
I was gonna say, what if
we take the pressure off

21:44.090 --> 21:46.879
of not having to write a fight song,

21:46.880 --> 21:48.879
and just do like, whatever.

21:48.880 --> 21:50.166
- Okay.
- Whatever comes to mind.

21:50.167 --> 21:52.763
- Let's start with just like two chords.

21:52.764 --> 21:54.245
- Okay.
- Just playing two chords

21:54.246 --> 21:55.683
back and forth.
- Okay, okay.

21:55.684 --> 21:57.362
- And then you can kind of...

21:57.363 --> 21:58.839
- Oh wow, you've really done it.

21:58.840 --> 21:59.727
- Figure out the melody.
- Yeah.

21:59.728 --> 22:02.199
- Okay?
- Okay, all right.

22:02.200 --> 22:03.200
- You sure?

22:04.880 --> 22:07.004
I like that.

22:07.005 --> 22:08.604
Kind of like some doo-wop action.

22:08.605 --> 22:09.879
- Okay, doo-woppy-

22:14.200 --> 22:16.079
♫ Do-do do do

22:16.080 --> 22:19.039
♫ Do-do do-do do do

22:19.040 --> 22:21.168
♫ Do do do-do
- I like that rhythm.

22:21.169 --> 22:24.359
♫ Do-do do-do do do

22:24.360 --> 22:27.319
♫ Night's creepin' in

22:27.320 --> 22:30.359
♫ I'm feelin' low

22:30.360 --> 22:32.319
♫ Do-do do do

22:32.320 --> 22:33.839
♫ Do-do do-do

22:33.840 --> 22:35.479
Okay.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.639
♫ No money, no friends

22:37.640 --> 22:41.239
♫ Got nowhere to go

22:41.240 --> 22:42.924
- So, we've done two bars.

22:42.925 --> 22:44.684
- Yeah, we're in deep.

22:46.160 --> 22:49.119
♫ A rumble in my belly

22:49.120 --> 22:51.839
♫ My throat is parched

22:51.840 --> 22:52.840
- Parched.

22:55.160 --> 22:56.399
Okay, okay, I'm gonna get it.

22:56.400 --> 22:57.287
Yeah, I got one.

22:57.288 --> 22:59.719
♫ I'm searchin' for the light

22:59.720 --> 23:02.849
♫ In the endless dark

23:04.440 --> 23:05.846
- I think we have to change it.

23:05.847 --> 23:06.959
- Is it feeling repetitive?

23:06.960 --> 23:07.800
- A little bit.
- Okay.

23:07.801 --> 23:08.640
- We're only two songs into it,

23:08.641 --> 23:09.480
but it's repetitive.
- Let's do it.

23:09.481 --> 23:10.447
Let's do like a...
- So, I would go to this.

23:10.448 --> 23:12.966
Ah, I found it.

23:12.967 --> 23:14.639
♫ Do-do do

23:14.640 --> 23:18.239
♫ Do-do do-do do

23:18.240 --> 23:19.082
All right?

23:19.083 --> 23:21.439
♫ Do-do do
♫ Crashes

23:21.440 --> 23:23.759
♫ Of green and red

23:23.760 --> 23:24.647
- Oh.

23:24.648 --> 23:26.279
<i>Fl</i> An 18 inch

23:26.280 --> 23:29.959
♫ That's where I can rest my head

23:29.960 --> 23:32.799
♫ You're my sunrise slice

23:32.800 --> 23:34.959
♫ To welcome the dawn

23:34.960 --> 23:35.802
Oh yeah.

23:35.803 --> 23:38.599
♫ You're my sunrise slice

23:38.600 --> 23:41.729
♫ To welcome the dawn

23:43.400 --> 23:46.239
♫ My papa

23:46.240 --> 23:49.119
♫ My Papa John

23:49.120 --> 23:51.879
♫ My papa

23:51.880 --> 23:54.119
♫ My Papa John

23:54.120 --> 23:54.928
- Bring it home.

23:54.929 --> 23:57.519
♫ My papa

23:57.520 --> 24:00.091
♫ My Papa John

24:04.280 --> 24:05.122
- Wow.

24:05.123 --> 24:06.199
- Whoa.

24:06.200 --> 24:07.167
- That was really nice.

24:09.040 --> 24:11.008
- Oh my god, that was so cool.

24:11.009 --> 24:13.239
I feel like it was almost like,

24:13.240 --> 24:14.571
almost like a...
- Simon and Garfunkel?

24:14.572 --> 24:17.404
- Almost like a solo
Simon, too, I was feeling.

24:17.405 --> 24:18.479
- Yeah, totally.

24:18.480 --> 24:20.239
- Like "The Rhythm of
the Saints", like.

24:20.240 --> 24:21.080
- Uh-huh.

24:21.081 --> 24:22.364
And this is working great for me.

24:22.365 --> 24:23.325
I am so shocked

24:23.326 --> 24:25.163
that the guy from Blues
Traveler never did this.

24:28.800 --> 24:29.642
How fun is this?

24:29.643 --> 24:31.639
- This is so fun.

24:31.640 --> 24:34.359
Okay, let's make a list

24:34.360 --> 24:37.045
of our top 10 fights of all-time.

24:38.080 --> 24:39.206
- Of all-time?

24:40.320 --> 24:42.159
- Why, does that,

24:42.160 --> 24:43.080
that's not good?

24:43.081 --> 24:44.045
TOP 12?

24:44.046 --> 24:44.848
"TOP 12?

24:44.849 --> 24:45.921
That's only two more.

24:45.922 --> 24:47.283
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

24:47.284 --> 24:49.089
Let's start with, we'll start with 12.

24:49.090 --> 24:51.999
- Top 12 fights, all-time.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Okay.

24:55.240 --> 24:56.999
Dishes is big, obviously.
- That is big.

24:57.000 --> 24:57.842
- That's a big one.

24:57.843 --> 25:00.319
- You seem to have a general,

25:00.320 --> 25:02.561
a problem with my grooming.

25:03.840 --> 25:04.682
- Yeah.

25:04.683 --> 25:06.279
For sure, that's spot-on.
- An issue.

25:06.280 --> 25:07.120
- Yeah.

25:07.121 --> 25:08.690
But I feel like grooming and
dishes can kind of go together.

25:08.680 --> 25:09.567
- Okay.
- So maybe we just,

25:09.568 --> 25:10.799
like a cleanliness thing.

25:10.800 --> 25:11.839
- Okay.

25:11.840 --> 25:13.479
Um.

25:13.480 --> 25:15.959
I don't wanna point any fingers here,

25:15.960 --> 25:18.239
but I think you can be
a little judgemental.

25:18.240 --> 25:19.127
- Okay, okay-

25:19.128 --> 25:21.239
Sure, I can see that.

25:21.240 --> 25:22.321
I will see your judgemental,

25:22.322 --> 25:25.319
and I will raise you a you being lazy.

25:25.320 --> 25:26.287
- Okay, you're uptight-

25:26.288 --> 25:27.519
- You're distracted.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.399
- Sure, yeah, you know.

25:29.400 --> 25:30.719
Um.

25:30.720 --> 25:33.371
You have emotions coming out of your ass.

25:33.372 --> 25:36.039
- You have no emotions.

25:36.040 --> 25:37.319
Ever.

25:37.320 --> 25:38.810
- Okay, you're obsessed
with the way you look.

25:38.800 --> 25:39.801
- Right.
- You're constantly asking me

25:39.802 --> 25:41.279
how you look, it's super annoying.

25:41.280 --> 25:43.246
- Right, well, a lot of
that has to do with the fact

25:43.247 --> 25:45.047
that you just like never
give me a compliment.

25:45.048 --> 25:46.199
- I give you compliments all the time.

25:46.200 --> 25:47.326
- Whenever you give me a compliment,

25:47.327 --> 25:48.922
it's only when I ask for a compliment.

25:48.923 --> 25:51.885
And even then, it's like, you
do that thing where it's like,

25:51.886 --> 25:53.365
something happens where you go away

25:53.366 --> 25:55.442
for like 30 to 45 seconds,
and then you come back,

25:55.443 --> 25:57.044
and you're like, oh,

25:58.640 --> 25:59.959
uh, you look good.

25:59.960 --> 26:01.642
- That's a compliment.
- Hey, where's my sneakers.

26:01.643 --> 26:02.607
- That's a compliment.

26:02.608 --> 26:04.125
And have you seen those sneakers?

26:04.126 --> 26:06.168
No, you didn't even look.

26:07.680 --> 26:10.283
You know what, if we're living
in this post-feminist society

26:10.284 --> 26:12.009
where I have to do the dishes

26:12.010 --> 26:15.479
and you don't have to blow me, like ever,

26:15.480 --> 26:16.965
I would say it's probably pretty fair

26:16.966 --> 26:19.042
that you would start
giving me more compliments.

26:19.043 --> 26:21.119
- Oh wow, okay.

26:21.120 --> 26:22.439
- I'm serious.
- Sure, yeah.

26:22.440 --> 26:23.441
- I would love to feel complimented.

26:23.442 --> 26:25.601
- Okay, you're a regular Gloria Steinem.

26:25.602 --> 26:27.085
- I am, I'm Gary Steinem.

26:27.086 --> 26:29.039
I'm fighting the fight for man's rights.

26:29.040 --> 26:30.039
- Very good.

26:30.040 --> 26:30.882
- Oh.

26:36.440 --> 26:38.239
That is a drum roll.

26:38.240 --> 26:39.046
- Who cares?

26:39.047 --> 26:39.882
Fine.

26:45.560 --> 26:46.759
- Shit.

26:46.760 --> 26:48.079
- Yeah.

26:48.080 --> 26:50.599
- You know what we need?

26:50.600 --> 26:51.600
- A drummer.

26:53.360 --> 26:54.962
- I don't know if he's home.

26:54.963 --> 26:56.450
- I'm sure he's just tending to women

26:56.451 --> 26:58.239
he keeps in his basement.

26:58.240 --> 26:59.967
- You don't think he
keeps 'em in the walls?

26:59.968 --> 27:00.802
- No, it's definitely more

27:00.803 --> 27:03.279
of a lotion in the basket vibe to me.

27:03.280 --> 27:04.167
- See, I think it...

27:04.168 --> 27:05.319
- Hi.
- Hey.

27:05.320 --> 27:06.843
- Hey.
- Hey neighbors.

27:06.844 --> 27:08.079
What are you doing?

27:08.080 --> 27:09.080
- Um.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.204
If it's a bad time, we can come back.

27:11.205 --> 27:12.120
- Yeah.
- What?

27:12.121 --> 27:13.563
No, don't be a couple of billy goats.

27:13.564 --> 27:14.564
Come on in.

27:15.520 --> 27:16.759
- Okay.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.159
- Don't wanna be a billy goat.

27:19.160 --> 27:20.279
- Have a seat.

27:20.280 --> 27:21.088
- Wow, it's...

27:21.089 --> 27:22.363
- You can sit on the left,

27:22.364 --> 27:24.479
and then you can sit on the right.

27:24.480 --> 27:25.604
- Okay.
- That's very specific.

27:25.605 --> 27:26.567
- Yeah.
- Okay.

27:26.568 --> 27:28.924
- It's very cozy in here.
- Mm-hmm.

27:28.925 --> 27:31.161
- Such an honor to have you in my home.

27:31.162 --> 27:35.245
- Yeah, it's nice to be
here.

27:36.400 --> 27:37.242
- Do you want anything?

27:37.243 --> 27:38.999
Do you want some cocoa?

27:39.000 --> 27:40.239
- I'm okay.
- I would take a cocoa.

27:40.240 --> 27:41.162
- Okay.
- Sure.

27:41.163 --> 27:43.279
- Cassandra Diabla, cocoas, please.

27:43.280 --> 27:44.247
We have guests.

27:44.248 --> 27:48.159
- I don't know who she is.
- Extra cocoas.

27:48.160 --> 27:49.160
- Hi.

27:49.920 --> 27:52.161
- This is my best
friend, Cassandra Diabla.

27:52.162 --> 27:53.959
- It's nice to meet you.

27:53.960 --> 27:56.247
- Hi.
- Hi, Cassandra Diabla?

27:57.640 --> 27:58.721
- Tonight's cocoa night.

27:58.722 --> 28:01.199
Careful, it's a little ouchie.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.519
How can I be of service
to the both of you?

28:03.520 --> 28:04.759
I mean, is there something you want?

28:04.760 --> 28:05.799
- David.

28:05.800 --> 28:07.079
We're out of cocoa.

28:07.080 --> 28:08.519
- What?
- Yeah.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.559
- We're out of cocoa.

28:09.560 --> 28:10.527
- Totally out.

28:10.528 --> 28:12.439
- There's none left?
- There's no more.

28:12.440 --> 28:13.282
- You're kidding me.

28:13.283 --> 28:15.799
You have mine, I insist.

28:15.800 --> 28:18.479
Otherwise Cocoa Tuesdays will
have to be No Cocoa Tuesdays.

28:18.480 --> 28:19.322
You know what I mean?

28:19.323 --> 28:20.639
- 1 do.

28:20.640 --> 28:21.766
- This is my best friend.

28:21.767 --> 28:23.808
- Hi, Crystal Vichycoisse.

28:24.760 --> 28:25.568
- Hi.

28:25.569 --> 28:27.083
- Your friends are so nice.

28:27.084 --> 28:28.406
- Thank you very much.

28:28.407 --> 28:30.279
- Are you here of your own will?

28:30.280 --> 28:31.770
- That's a joke, you
don't have to answer that.

28:31.760 --> 28:32.600
- What was the joke?

28:32.601 --> 28:34.043
- Mm, no, nothing.
- It was just something rude

28:34.044 --> 28:34.880
that she said...

28:34.881 --> 28:35.845
- I didn't...
- Because she got nervous.

28:35.846 --> 28:37.126
- I was joking.
- And it's just a joke.

28:37.127 --> 28:39.039
- Am I here on my own free will?

28:39.040 --> 28:40.530
- Oh, so she looked at
you and she was like,

28:40.520 --> 28:41.759
are you here on your own free will?

28:41.760 --> 28:43.410
- That was what she said, I think.

28:44.760 --> 28:46.319
- You're like a Paula Poundstone.

28:46.320 --> 28:47.444
- Yeah.
- Yes, very much so.

28:47.445 --> 28:48.564
- I do get that a lot.
- Very much so.

28:48.565 --> 28:49.400
- Yeah.

28:49.401 --> 28:50.970
- We actually met at
a Todd Rundgren event.

28:50.971 --> 28:53.239
- A Todd Rundgren event.

28:53.240 --> 28:54.399
- Yes.
- Okay.

28:54.400 --> 28:57.159
- There was, it was a
record release party.

28:57.160 --> 28:58.002
I'm kidding.

28:58.003 --> 28:59.519
Oh.

28:59.520 --> 29:00.726
- You should have seen your faces.

29:00.727 --> 29:03.610
- No, we met at a cocoa convention.

29:04.600 --> 29:07.079
- Yeah, that one
is very clearly a joke.

29:07.080 --> 29:08.079
We get it.
- Well, is it?

29:08.080 --> 29:08.920
Is it, though?

29:08.921 --> 29:10.251
- Yeah, she gets her sense of humor

29:10.252 --> 29:12.321
from her Great Uncle Avram.
- Yeah.

29:12.322 --> 29:14.687
- He was a star in the
Yiddish vaudeville circuit.

29:14.688 --> 29:18.039
- Right, okay.

29:18.040 --> 29:20.799
- He was a star in the
Yiddish vaudeville circuit.

29:20.800 --> 29:21.801
<i>- Okay.</i>

29:21.802 --> 29:22.879
- Yeah.

29:22.880 --> 29:27.010
- No, he toured the Ukraine
after escaping the pogroms.

29:28.720 --> 29:30.279
- Uh, okay-

29:30.280 --> 29:33.559
So, how did you guys actually meet?

29:33.560 --> 29:35.125
- We met in the program.

29:35.126 --> 29:36.479
- What program?
- The program?

29:36.480 --> 29:37.480
- Well,

29:38.280 --> 29:39.839
SAA.

29:39.840 --> 29:42.599
We're recovering sex addicts.

29:42.600 --> 29:43.440
- I think we should...
- Okay.

29:43.441 --> 29:44.726
- Probably go, because remember, we...

29:44.727 --> 29:46.243
- And I'm their sponsor.

29:46.244 --> 29:47.599
And also their best friend.

29:47.600 --> 29:48.440
And they're my best friends.

29:48.441 --> 29:49.327
- That's very sweet.

29:49.328 --> 29:52.039
- I know this is gonna seem crazy.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.799
We were strippers.

29:53.800 --> 29:55.562
- What, no.
- You don't say.

29:55.563 --> 29:57.799
- Yeah, she was, and then she was.

29:57.800 --> 29:58.642
- Yeah.

29:58.643 --> 30:00.563
- Also, we love to fuck.

30:01.640 --> 30:04.371
- Dave, you should join our band.

30:05.360 --> 30:07.010
- So, Vichycoisse, is that how you say it?

30:07.011 --> 30:08.559
Vichycoisse?
- Vichycoisse.

30:08.560 --> 30:09.846
- Vichycoisse.
- That's what she said.

30:09.847 --> 30:12.127
- Okay, soup is made of blended potatoes

30:12.128 --> 30:13.565
and a heavy cream.

30:14.600 --> 30:15.599
- Wow.
- That sounds amazing.

30:15.600 --> 30:16.565
- Wow.

30:16.566 --> 30:17.527
- So Weird Dave is in your band?

30:17.528 --> 30:18.965
- Weird Dave's in the band.

30:18.966 --> 30:20.959
- Wow.
- Yeah, I know.

30:20.960 --> 30:23.723
But you know, the truth
is we needed a drummer,

30:23.724 --> 30:26.644
and his only time commitments
seem to be Cocoa Tuesdays

30:26.645 --> 30:28.759
and sex addict meetings, so.

30:28.760 --> 30:31.519
- Oh, oh, sweet schedule, Weird Dave.

30:31.520 --> 30:34.679
- Yeah, yeah, Dave's got it figured out.

30:34.680 --> 30:36.569
- Yeah, he's not makin' mistakes at all.

30:36.570 --> 30:38.319
- No, at all.
- At all.

30:38.320 --> 30:39.599
- Great.
- What?

30:39.600 --> 30:40.724
- Single Sheena, Single Sheena.

30:40.725 --> 30:42.290
- She's the last one of us left.

30:42.291 --> 30:43.403
- I know.
- Exciting.

30:43.404 --> 30:44.561
- Such a rare occurrence.

30:44.562 --> 30:45.799
It's like, it feels...

30:45.800 --> 30:47.399
- Hi.
- Hi, Sheena.

30:47.400 --> 30:48.285
- Hi.
- How are you?

30:48.286 --> 30:49.088
<i>- Hey.
- Oh my god,</i>

30:49.089 --> 30:50.919
you look so pretty.
- Just gorgeous.

30:50.920 --> 30:52.046
- What's happening?
- Flawless.

30:52.047 --> 30:53.359
- Are you going somewhere?

30:53.360 --> 30:54.359
Are you coming from something?

30:54.360 --> 30:55.327
- Oh no, I'm headed home.

30:55.328 --> 30:57.368
I spent the night at some guy's house.

30:57.369 --> 30:58.719
- Oh, there it is.

30:58.720 --> 30:59.799
- I would love to hear

30:59.800 --> 31:00.720
about that.
- Details, details,

31:00.721 --> 31:02.243
not just a magazine, honey.
- Yes, please.

31:02.244 --> 31:03.207
- Um, I don't know.

31:03.208 --> 31:04.919
I mean, he was super hot.

31:04.920 --> 31:06.964
' YEP, YEP, YEP, YEP, YEP-
- Yeah, sure.

31:06.965 --> 31:08.559
- He has like a ton of money.

31:08.560 --> 31:09.925
- Makes the world go 'round.
- Go and get yours.

31:09.926 --> 31:13.603
- And he went down on me for
like an hour, so that was fun.

31:13.604 --> 31:14.723
- That's a...
- Long time.

31:14.724 --> 31:15.959
- Whole episode of Scandal.

31:15.960 --> 31:17.119
I mean...
- A long time.

31:17.120 --> 31:17.960
- So, I don't know.

31:17.961 --> 31:18.925
I might see him again, might not.

31:18.926 --> 31:21.080
But anyways, I gotta run,
gotta shower before I teach.

31:21.081 --> 31:21.922
Good to see you, though.

31:21.923 --> 31:23.079
- Sure, bye.

31:23.080 --> 31:24.679
- She is a teacher?

31:24.680 --> 31:25.727
- Well, she teaches Pilates.

31:25.728 --> 31:27.719
- Oh, I'll get over it then.

31:27.720 --> 31:29.159
An hour.
- One hour.

31:29.160 --> 31:30.844
- That is gonna get me
through sex with my husband

31:30.845 --> 31:32.079
for like a good week.

31:32.080 --> 31:33.279
A week.
- I'm riled up.

31:33.280 --> 31:34.691
I'm riled up.
- Oh, it is Niagara Falls

31:34.692 --> 31:36.279
down there.
- It's like a burning,

31:36.280 --> 31:37.247
burning fire.
- Yeah, yeah.

31:37.248 --> 31:38.810
I need to air that out now.

31:40.880 --> 31:42.639
' Babe?

31:42.640 --> 31:44.159
- Yeah.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.439
' Hi.

31:45.440 --> 31:47.090
- What's up, Boomer?

31:48.760 --> 31:51.604
- I was thinking, do you want to...

31:56.920 --> 31:58.399
You know what I mean?

31:58.400 --> 31:59.640
You wanna fuck?

32:01.680 --> 32:03.808
You wanna fuck this pussy?

32:04.960 --> 32:05.959
- Right now?

32:05.960 --> 32:07.399
- Yeah.

32:07.400 --> 32:08.679
You wanna fuck?

32:08.680 --> 32:10.279
- Yeah, I'll fuck.

32:10.280 --> 32:12.123
- You wanna fuck this pussy?

32:12.124 --> 32:13.279
- Aw yeah.

32:13.280 --> 32:14.925
- Get it, get it, get it, get it.

32:16.685 --> 32:17.806
- Let's do it.

32:19.120 --> 32:20.643
- Oh, were you just,
you weren't even going?

32:20.644 --> 32:22.085
- No, I just like to sit on the toilet

32:22.086 --> 32:23.969
and let my butt-hole be free.

32:23.970 --> 32:26.839
Makes me more productive.

32:26.840 --> 32:27.840
Let's go.

32:34.320 --> 32:35.160
- That's good.

32:35.161 --> 32:36.002
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

32:36.003 --> 32:37.445
Maybe, what if we,

32:38.760 --> 32:40.405
what if you just reposition for,

32:40.406 --> 32:42.129
or like...
- I'll reposition.

32:42.130 --> 32:45.010
- Just get that angle a little bit.

32:46.480 --> 32:47.641
- Your face, the face that you're,

32:47.642 --> 32:49.759
can you just not make that face?

32:49.760 --> 32:51.362
- I'm sorry, no, no, no.
- 'Cause it's just like,

32:51.363 --> 32:52.166
It looks like you're in pain.

32:52.167 --> 32:53.002
- I'm not in pain.

32:53.003 --> 32:54.805
I'm just trying to figure,

32:54.806 --> 32:56.039
I'm trying to figure it out.

32:56.040 --> 32:56.880
I'm sorry.

32:56.881 --> 32:57.720
I don't know what happened.

32:57.721 --> 32:59.085
I was just like, I was so horny before.

32:59.086 --> 33:02.159
And then suddenly it's like,

33:02.160 --> 33:05.999
I don't know, it's like the
fuckin' shop just closed.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.079
- The shop closed?

33:07.080 --> 33:07.920
- Yeah.

33:07.921 --> 33:08.921
Like the

33:10.600 --> 33:12.165
door's locked, gate's down.

33:12.166 --> 33:13.286
Like, the whole situation.

33:13.287 --> 33:16.921
I don't know how to
contact the shop keeper.

33:18.440 --> 33:19.407
You know what I mean?

33:22.640 --> 33:24.839
It might be a situation where

33:24.840 --> 33:26.485
it's like there's a sign on the door,

33:26.486 --> 33:28.082
and they're like, back in five.

33:28.083 --> 33:29.919
- This analogy is super long.

33:29.920 --> 33:30.920
- Yeah.

33:33.800 --> 33:34.640
Okay.

33:34.641 --> 33:35.641
Well,

33:36.640 --> 33:37.482
I'm sorry.

33:37.483 --> 33:39.005
Do you want me to give you a hand-job?

33:39.006 --> 33:40.679
- What? No.

33:40.680 --> 33:43.365
I didn't even wanna have
sex in the first place.

33:43.366 --> 33:46.799
I only did it because you wanted to.

33:46.800 --> 33:48.919
- Right, I know.

33:48.920 --> 33:50.410
One, two, three, four.

34:01.680 --> 34:05.287
♫ Marriage is a sacred bond

34:07.000 --> 34:10.721
♫ Of you and it I am so fond

34:12.440 --> 34:16.570
♫ Friendship, care, the ties that bind

34:17.760 --> 34:21.889
♫ You're loving, caring, always kind

34:23.360 --> 34:27.489
♫ But when we lay in bed at night

34:28.679 --> 34:32.844
♫ Our bodies bathed in the moonlight

34:34.120 --> 34:38.250
♫ To have, to hold forever, oh dear

34:39.600 --> 34:44.399
♫ Please don't bring your body near

34:44.400 --> 34:46.998
♫ 'Cause I

34:47.000 --> 34:49.359
♫ I love you

34:49.360 --> 34:52.364
♫ But I don't wanna fuck
you, fuck you, fuck you

34:52.364 --> 34:55.759
♫ I don't wanna fuck you

34:55.760 --> 34:59.048
♫ Our, our love is true

35:00.440 --> 35:03.410
♫ But I don't wanna fuck
you, fuck you, fuck you

35:03.411 --> 35:06.879
♫ I don't wanna fuck you

35:06.880 --> 35:09.281
♫ I love you

35:14.440 --> 35:16.249
- That was rad.

35:18.760 --> 35:20.279
- Dave?

35:20.280 --> 35:22.279
Dave?
- What's happening?

35:22.280 --> 35:23.361
Is he, so you think he's okay?

35:23.362 --> 35:24.959
- You're asking me?

35:24.960 --> 35:25.960
- Dave.

35:27.400 --> 35:28.365
- Unreal.

35:28.366 --> 35:29.200
I loved it.
- There it is.

35:29.201 --> 35:30.042
- Wow.
- Okay.

35:30.043 --> 35:31.201
Great, thank you.
- Cool.

35:31.202 --> 35:34.639
- That was very beautiful,
beginning to end.

35:34.640 --> 35:35.480
- Thanks.

35:35.481 --> 35:37.050
- You know, I can't relate
to the lyrics at all.

35:37.051 --> 35:38.525
- Right.
- On account of the fact

35:38.526 --> 35:40.759
that I wanna fuck
everything and everybody.

35:40.760 --> 35:42.922
- Yeah, that's your thing.
- Right, that's the addiction.

35:42.923 --> 35:45.603
- I mean, except of course
Crystal and Cassandra.

35:45.604 --> 35:47.079
- You never wanna fuck them?

35:47.080 --> 35:47.888
- No.

35:47.889 --> 35:49.479
- No.
- Never.

35:49.480 --> 35:52.999
But that's a love song for the ages.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.359
Bravo.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.165
- Thank you.
- It's a standing ovation.

35:56.166 --> 35:59.004
- Thank you, Dave.
- Thank you so much, man.

35:59.005 --> 36:00.889
- I'm gonna go and eat.

36:01.840 --> 36:03.239
- Okay.
- Okay.

36:03.240 --> 36:04.082
That sounds human.

36:04.083 --> 36:05.599
- And I'll see you very soon.

36:05.600 --> 36:06.485
- All right.
- All right, thanks.

36:06.486 --> 36:07.322
- Take it easy, man.
- Thanks.

36:07.323 --> 36:08.919
We'll see you next rehearsal, okay.

36:08.920 --> 36:09.887

36:14.680 --> 36:18.359
- Man, I like
writing songs with you.

36:18.360 --> 36:21.559
- I like writing songs with you.

36:31.600 --> 36:32.681
- We're never
done it in the garage.

36:32.682 --> 36:34.119
- I know, it's so hot.

36:34.120 --> 36:35.281
- Let's do it in more weird places.

36:35.282 --> 36:39.251
- It's not that
weird, we own this garage.

36:42.282 --> 36:43.519
- Oh my god.

36:43.520 --> 36:44.520
Oh fuck.

36:45.520 --> 36:46.681
Oh my god.

36:46.682 --> 36:47.719
- Shit.

36:47.720 --> 36:48.881
- I know, it feels so fucking good.

36:48.882 --> 36:51.087
- No, no, I'm stuck in a rat trap.

36:51.088 --> 36:52.119
- What?

36:52.120 --> 36:53.722
- My foot is stuck in
one of the glue traps

36:53.723 --> 36:54.560
like a mouse.
- Like a rat trap?

36:54.561 --> 36:55.400
- Yeah.

36:55.401 --> 36:56.208
- It's okay.

36:56.209 --> 36:57.399
Can you push through?

36:57.400 --> 36:58.399
Use your body.

36:58.400 --> 36:59.603
Please keep fucking me.

36:59.604 --> 37:00.931
It feels so fucking good.

37:00.932 --> 37:03.199
Oh my god, oh my god.

37:03.200 --> 37:04.359
My foot is going numb.

37:04.360 --> 37:05.407
- Oh my god, that feels so good.

37:05.408 --> 37:07.561
- The whole left side of
my body is going numb.

37:08.562 --> 37:10.519
I'm coming.

37:12.640 --> 37:13.640
Ow, ow.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.279
- We buy kale.

37:21.280 --> 37:23.324
The kale sits in our fridge for a week.

37:23.325 --> 37:24.646
We throw out the kale.

37:24.647 --> 37:26.083
And then we buy that kale again.

37:26.084 --> 37:27.411
- It's all very exciting.

37:27.412 --> 37:28.599
- It's a real...

37:28.600 --> 37:29.647
- It's the kale diaries.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.879
- Look, our people.

37:33.880 --> 37:35.599
- You think they're Jews?

37:35.600 --> 37:38.559
- No, I just mean musicians.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.559
Should we go over there?

37:40.560 --> 37:41.919
- You wanna get into a drum circle

37:41.920 --> 37:43.046
by the farmer's market.
- I don't know.

37:43.047 --> 37:44.929
We should get inspired.

37:46.400 --> 37:47.599
- Okay.

37:47.600 --> 37:49.039
- They look friendly.

37:49.040 --> 37:50.962
- Yeah, all drum circles look friendly.

37:50.963 --> 37:52.928
That's how people end up in them.

37:56.160 --> 37:57.000
- Hi.

37:57.001 --> 37:58.001
- Hi, what's up?

some of our love light today?

38:05.284 --> 38:07.239

- What?

38:07.240 --> 38:08.080
No, we weren't.
- Lover's light.

38:08.081 --> 38:08.922
Yes, we were.

38:48.200 --> 38:49.167
- What language was that?

38:49.168 --> 38:50.443
- Yeah, was that Sanskrit?

38:50.444 --> 38:52.245
- No, I devised that language myself,

38:52.246 --> 38:53.479
it's called Tuna-Tuna,

38:53.480 --> 38:55.119
while I was studying abroad.

38:55.120 --> 38:55.962
- Tuna-Tuna.

38:55.963 --> 38:58.122
- Tuna-Tuna is the name of the language

38:58.123 --> 39:00.319
that you devised.
- Was that

39:00.320 --> 39:01.399
in India, or?

I haven't seen you like that.

39:11.292 --> 39:14.359

39:14.360 --> 39:16.119
- Yeah, I was bothered.

39:16.120 --> 39:18.202
- I know, you were less hot.

39:18.203 --> 39:19.486
Wait, oh my god.

39:20.720 --> 39:22.919
Look, it's a sign.

39:22.920 --> 39:23.726
- Like, from the universe,

39:23.727 --> 39:25.006
it's a sign or like a...
- Well, I was saying it is,

39:25.007 --> 39:26.081
it's also a literal sign.

39:26.082 --> 39:28.239
But it is, that's a sign.

39:46.680 --> 39:48.442
Since when have you been
afraid of doing mushrooms?

39:48.443 --> 39:50.124
- I'm not afraid of doing
mushrooms, I've just,

39:50.125 --> 39:53.639
I've never done them with a task at hand.

39:53.640 --> 39:55.881

39:55.882 --> 39:58.403

- Oh good.

40:14.200 --> 40:15.040
- These ones are mellow.

40:15.041 --> 40:16.041
- Good.

40:31.360 --> 40:32.486
I got an idea.

40:33.880 --> 40:35.399
Where's my notebook?

40:35.400 --> 40:36.399
- What?

40:36.400 --> 40:38.799
- I have a song idea,
I wanna write it down.

40:38.800 --> 40:39.800
- Okay.

40:41.240 --> 40:42.080

Hurry up, I'm losin' the melody.

41:17.560 --> 41:19.449
- Here's your notebook.

41:23.680 --> 41:25.170
It's just so crazy

41:26.640 --> 41:29.371
how the birds just love my chips.

41:30.960 --> 41:33.611
- Get right up next
to them, they whisper.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.809
And I also love chips,

41:42.320 --> 41:44.799
but I never just go eat the chips.

41:44.800 --> 41:48.279
And that's why I love you birds.

41:48.280 --> 41:51.759
Because you just go whenever you want it.

41:51.760 --> 41:53.319
And you get it.

41:53.320 --> 41:55.402
Hi.

41:57.480 --> 42:00.689
- I just wrote the most beautiful song.

42:14.320 --> 42:16.607
I can't remember the lyrics.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.439
Do you remember the first line?

42:22.440 --> 42:23.360
- I didn't write it.

42:23.361 --> 42:24.599
- I know, but we came up with it together.

42:24.600 --> 42:26.559
- You came up with it.

42:26.560 --> 42:27.599
' It...

42:27.600 --> 42:28.442
- I don't know the lyrics.

42:28.443 --> 42:31.399
- Babe, you remember, it was
about something like a dog?

42:31.400 --> 42:32.639
- Maybe you wrote it down somewhere.

42:32.640 --> 42:34.079
- Um, yeah, he did.

42:34.080 --> 42:34.922
He actually did.

42:34.923 --> 42:38.719
He recorded it telepathically
onto a sandwich.

42:38.720 --> 42:40.085
- The lyrics are in my blood.
- Which he then ate.

42:40.086 --> 42:41.919
No, the drugs are in
your blood, the lyrics

42:41.920 --> 42:43.807
are like.
- You wanted to take drugs.

42:43.808 --> 42:44.961
- Oh my god, that's so classic,

42:44.962 --> 42:46.039
to turn this around on me.

42:46.040 --> 42:46.880
- I'm turning it around?
- Yeah.

42:46.881 --> 42:47.720
- You're turning it around on me.

42:47.721 --> 42:48.799
You wanted to take drugs,
it didn't work out,

42:48.800 --> 42:49.642
and now you're acting

42:49.643 --> 42:51.599
like a bitch.
- It didn't work out?

42:51.600 --> 42:52.440
Did you just call me a bitch?

42:52.441 --> 42:53.963
- No, I said you're acting like a bitch.

42:53.964 --> 42:55.450
- What kind of man calls
their wife a bitch?

42:55.440 --> 42:56.485
- Why do you have
to question my manhood?

42:56.486 --> 42:57.445
And what's...
- Because what kind of man

42:57.446 --> 42:58.930
calls a woman a bitch.
- You call me a dick

42:58.920 --> 42:59.760
all the time,

42:59.761 --> 43:01.205
why can't I call you a bitch?
- Oh my god.

43:01.206 --> 43:02.279
That's so lame.

43:02.280 --> 43:04.203
- Why is that lame?

43:04.204 --> 43:06.039
- Um, I'm gonna go for now.

43:06.040 --> 43:06.880
- No.
- No.

43:06.881 --> 43:08.484
- Just sit down for a second.
- Dave, sit down, please.

43:08.485 --> 43:10.719
Just give us one minute.

43:10.720 --> 43:12.083
- Why don't I give you some privacy,

43:12.084 --> 43:12.920
and I can...
- That's definitely

43:12.921 --> 43:14.044
not what we want.
- We don't need any privacy.

43:14.045 --> 43:14.962
This is not a private matter.
- No.

43:14.963 --> 43:17.691
You leave, this gets real, so let's just,

43:17.692 --> 43:20.079
we're gonna just push through.

43:20.080 --> 43:21.045
- Can I get some air?

43:21.046 --> 43:22.244
- No, you can't get air when...
- Air?

43:22.245 --> 43:24.002
- There's open air everywhere.
- We're in a garage!

43:24.003 --> 43:25.081
- What more air do you need?

43:27.040 --> 43:27.848

43:31.160 --> 43:32.000
- Why?
- Just give us a second.

43:32.001 --> 43:33.604
- We need to finish
this for one second.

43:33.605 --> 43:34.679
- Why?

43:34.680 --> 43:37.443
Because I'm being held hostage,
so I'm just gonna play.

43:37.444 --> 43:38.723
- Dave, come on, man.

43:38.724 --> 43:40.051

- Don't make me wear a dress

46:04.487 --> 46:05.965
tonight, please.
- Okay.

46:05.966 --> 46:07.882
- Do you think it's too on-the-nose

46:07.883 --> 46:09.759
that we're making Dave dress like a baby?

46:09.760 --> 46:11.091
- I don't think that's the problem.

46:11.092 --> 46:12.965
No, I think that drives it home.

46:12.966 --> 46:14.639
It's very, I think it's subtle.

46:15.640 --> 46:16.480
Okay, it's go time.

46:16.481 --> 46:17.322
Do you have everything?

46:17.323 --> 46:18.726
- I have picks and...

46:18.727 --> 46:20.210
- Your wallet?
- My wallet and keys.

46:20.211 --> 46:21.247
Coming, Dave.

46:24.080 --> 46:25.519
Hey buddy.

46:25.520 --> 46:27.122
- What, where's your onesie?

46:27.123 --> 46:30.010
- I thought you were
Dave the Baby Drummer.

46:30.011 --> 46:32.839
- I'm turning over my sticks.

46:33.681 --> 46:34.522
- What?

46:34.523 --> 46:35.639
What is this?

46:35.640 --> 46:37.324
- I can't make it to the open mic tonight.

46:37.325 --> 46:39.839
Or, really, any night.

46:39.840 --> 46:42.519
I have to quit the band.

46:42.520 --> 46:43.520
- Why?

46:44.200 --> 46:45.690
What are you talking about?

46:45.691 --> 46:46.839
- What?

46:46.840 --> 46:48.126
- I thought it would be really great

46:48.127 --> 46:49.406
to get to know you guys,

46:49.407 --> 46:52.439
and for you guys to get to know me.

46:52.440 --> 46:53.407
You wouldn't think this,

46:53.408 --> 46:55.084
but aside from Crystal and Cassandra,

46:55.085 --> 46:57.279
I don't have too many friends.

46:57.280 --> 46:58.122
- Right.
- Really?

46:58.123 --> 46:59.643
- Yeah, that is surprising.

46:59.644 --> 47:01.244
- When my parents got divorced,

47:01.245 --> 47:03.679
it was really hard on me as a kid.

47:03.680 --> 47:07.439
And I think that's where my
sexual addiction started.

47:07.440 --> 47:08.999
Okay.

47:09.000 --> 47:09.999
- Do you understand what I'm saying?

47:10.843 --> 47:12.171
So, I'm reliving it.

47:12.172 --> 47:13.879
Day after day.

47:13.880 --> 47:16.679
You can't stop fighting.

47:16.680 --> 47:18.205
I mean, I spent my whole childhood trying

47:18.206 --> 47:19.802
to save my parents' marriage.

47:19.803 --> 47:22.963
I don't wanna spend my
adulthood trying to save yours.

47:22.964 --> 47:24.639
I'm really sorry.

47:24.640 --> 47:26.319
I can't do the show.

47:26.320 --> 47:27.599
I'm sorry.

47:27.600 --> 47:31.199
It's gonna be a great show anyway.

47:31.200 --> 47:32.759
- Is this for real.

47:32.760 --> 47:34.759
- Dave, these are your sticks.

47:38.680 --> 47:39.959
♫ I feel it

47:47.200 --> 47:50.359
♫ It feels so good to be home

47:50.360 --> 47:51.930
- Fuck man, I cannot believe it.

47:51.931 --> 47:54.279
- I know, it's so crazy.

47:54.280 --> 47:55.167
- We need Dave.

47:55.168 --> 47:56.571
We can't do this.

47:57.640 --> 47:58.766
- Whoa, tiger.

48:00.320 --> 48:01.160
Slow down.

48:01.161 --> 48:02.002
- Ah Shit.

48:02.003 --> 48:04.364
Grace gave me some
sort of muscle relaxants,

48:04.365 --> 48:05.725
but I don't feel them at all.

48:05.726 --> 48:07.759
Like, they are not working.

48:07.760 --> 48:09.760
- Muscle, what are you doing
taking muscle relaxants?

48:09.761 --> 48:11.444
- I don't know.
- You barely have any muscles.

48:11.445 --> 48:12.963
- I needed to calm down.

48:12.964 --> 48:16.248
- Look, this is just you and
me in our garage, jammin'.

48:16.249 --> 48:17.719
There's no difference.

48:17.720 --> 48:18.562
I mean, yeah,

48:18.563 --> 48:21.882
it's room full of young,
judgemental 20-somethings,

48:21.883 --> 48:24.279
staring at our every breath.

48:24.280 --> 48:27.119
But besides that, it's the same thing.

48:27.120 --> 48:29.799
- Looks like you two are up.

48:29.800 --> 48:31.159
- Okay, great.

48:31.160 --> 48:32.439
Salud.
- L'chaim.

48:35.280 --> 48:36.483
- Oh my god, I'm gonna hurl.

48:36.484 --> 48:37.843
- No hurling, no hurling, come on.

48:37.844 --> 48:38.844
- Hold on.

48:39.840 --> 48:40.807
- Let's just go up there,

48:40.808 --> 48:44.566
and show these young fuckin'
dickheads what we're made of.

48:44.567 --> 48:46.799
- Okay-

48:51.280 --> 48:52.566
- All right, hi.

48:53.960 --> 48:54.960
All right.

48:56.200 --> 48:59.719
One, two, a one, two, three, four.

48:59.720 --> 49:01.684
- Hold on, I gotta adjust
my mic for one second.

49:01.685 --> 49:03.405
- She's just adjusting her mic, sorry.

49:03.406 --> 49:04.845
Whoa, what are you doing?

49:04.846 --> 49:07.639
- I can't, I gotta adjust it.

49:07.640 --> 49:08.480
- What is wrong with you?

49:08.481 --> 49:09.322
What's happening?

49:09.323 --> 49:11.439
- Hold on, I think I just
want it out of the stand.

49:11.440 --> 49:12.280
- You can't have it

49:12.281 --> 49:13.120
out of the stand.
- Yeah,

49:13.121 --> 49:13.960
'cause I wanna be able to...
- How can you play with

49:13.961 --> 49:15.244
having it out of the stand?
- I need to be able to move.

49:15.245 --> 49:17.083
- You're a bass player,
you don't need to move.

49:17.084 --> 49:19.079
Oh god.

49:19.080 --> 49:19.920
Did that hurt?
- Fuck.

49:19.921 --> 49:20.760
Yes, it hurt.
- Are you okay?

49:20.761 --> 49:22.285
- Yeah, I'm fine, just
put it back on and let's...

49:22.286 --> 49:23.839
- Okay, but hold on.

49:23.840 --> 49:25.124
But lookit, I wanna do one trick.

49:25.125 --> 49:26.531
Can you look at the audience?
- What sort of trick?

49:26.520 --> 49:27.487
- Look at the audience for one sec.

49:27.488 --> 49:29.759
Watch, watch.

49:29.760 --> 49:32.119
- What are you doing?

49:32.120 --> 49:33.999
Okay, please just.

49:34.000 --> 49:35.525
- It was like the balls
were on your forehead,

49:35.526 --> 49:36.599
but it was the mic.

49:36.600 --> 49:37.440
- Are you ready?
- Go ahead.

49:37.441 --> 49:38.851
- Are you ready to play?
- Hold on.

49:38.852 --> 49:39.966
Hold on, yeah.

49:41.120 --> 49:42.559
- Sorry about that.

49:42.560 --> 49:44.050
One, two, a one...

49:46.480 --> 49:47.679
- Oh.

49:47.680 --> 49:48.680
What?

49:49.520 --> 49:51.039
Oh.

49:51.040 --> 49:52.839
Oh! oh! oh, Oh, Oh.

49:52.840 --> 49:54.839
I can fit this whole thing in my mouth.

49:54.840 --> 49:55.964
- Do you wanna play the song?

49:55.965 --> 49:56.802
- Huh?

49:56.803 --> 49:57.919
Oh, oh, ow.

49:57.920 --> 49:58.919
- You're embarrassing me.

49:58.920 --> 49:59.726
- I'm embarrassing you?

49:59.727 --> 50:00.528
You should be proud.

50:00.529 --> 50:03.599
That's what every husband
wishes their wife would do.

50:03.600 --> 50:04.408
- Oh my god.

50:06.163 --> 50:08.527
- Who are you winking at?
- That was,

50:08.528 --> 50:12.159
that was a click suck joke, guys.

50:12.160 --> 50:13.839
But it's actually not a,

50:13.840 --> 50:16.446
if you wanna be honest,
it's not a talent of mine.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.126
- Go home.

50:21.480 --> 50:24.119
' Oh god.

50:24.120 --> 50:24.928
- I wouldn't stress about it.

50:24.929 --> 50:27.239
It was just a minor setback.

50:27.240 --> 50:28.844
- I'm such an idiot.

50:30.040 --> 50:33.079
Just, the second I decide to commit

50:33.080 --> 50:34.491
to something I'm passionate about,

50:34.492 --> 50:37.211
I always seem to just fuck it up.

50:41.120 --> 50:42.007
- Can you do me a favor,

50:42.008 --> 50:45.891
and can we not talk about
your failed book deal

50:47.320 --> 50:50.759
while we're dealing with
stuff about us?

50:50.760 --> 50:51.999
- What?

50:52.000 --> 50:55.759
- Can you not talk about
your failed book deal

50:55.760 --> 50:56.959
when we're dealing with stuff

50:56.960 --> 50:57.959
that's about us?
- What are you talking about?

50:57.960 --> 50:59.323
I didn't even mention my book deal.

50:59.324 --> 51:00.160
- Come on.

51:00.161 --> 51:01.319
That's where you always go.
- Jesus.

51:01.320 --> 51:02.160
What are you...
- It doesn't seem...

51:02.161 --> 51:03.650
- So angry about?
- Like an outlandish request.

51:03.651 --> 51:04.879
It's just seems like

51:04.880 --> 51:06.403
something totally normal.
- Where is this coming from?

51:06.404 --> 51:07.526
- It's not coming from anywhere.

51:07.527 --> 51:08.639
I just don't wanna talk

51:08.640 --> 51:09.801
about the fucking book deal.
- Well, I got it.

51:09.802 --> 51:11.679
You already fucking said that.

51:11.680 --> 51:12.680
Jesus.

51:15.880 --> 51:17.799
Fuckin' Aggro Man.

51:17.800 --> 51:18.961
- You know what.
- Mr. Aggro,

51:18.962 --> 51:20.605
fucking flying in...
- We don't...

51:20.606 --> 51:23.251
- Just ruining relationships.
- We don't have to do this

51:23.252 --> 51:24.799
like this anymore.

51:24.800 --> 51:26.882
- Do what, what, do what?
- Fight like this.

51:26.883 --> 51:28.609
If we're gonna fight,

51:29.960 --> 51:32.531
why don't we sing our feelings?

51:35.160 --> 51:37.279
- I don't know, I'm not singing.

51:37.280 --> 51:38.086
- Why?
- I'm sorry.

51:38.087 --> 51:39.605
- Don't patronize it.
- No, I just can't.

51:39.606 --> 51:40.965
- It's just, we know what happens

51:40.966 --> 51:43.361
when we have a regular fight.

51:44.320 --> 51:45.606
We've done this.

51:46.960 --> 51:49.799
- I'm not, I'm not doing that though.

51:49.800 --> 51:50.800
Sorry.

51:54.520 --> 51:56.602
♫ Please don't bring up the book deal

51:56.603 --> 51:58.079
- Oh god.

51:58.080 --> 52:00.919
♫ You know this isn't about the book deal

52:00.920 --> 52:03.039
- Really, why not?

52:03.040 --> 52:05.439
I mean, it's
clearly the cross I bear.

52:05.440 --> 52:06.564
It's why I'm...
- I don't hear anything...

52:06.565 --> 52:07.639
- So fucking paralyzed.
- Unless you sing it.

52:07.640 --> 52:08.448
You have to sing it.

52:08.449 --> 52:09.521
- This is so stupid, dude.

52:09.522 --> 52:10.806
I'm not singing.

52:13.120 --> 52:15.803
- You hang on to that fuckin'
book deal for dear life.

52:15.804 --> 52:17.564
And you and I both know that that

52:17.565 --> 52:20.848
is not the thing that is paralyzing you.

52:23.640 --> 52:24.640
- Really?

52:25.880 --> 52:26.880
Okay, well.

52:29.640 --> 52:32.159
That was my fault, too, so.

52:32.160 --> 52:33.160
- Sing it.

52:34.280 --> 52:36.199
- I'm not singing about that, Ben.

52:36.200 --> 52:37.040
I don't even wanna talk

52:37.041 --> 52:37.927
about it.
- I don't wanna talk

52:37.928 --> 52:39.206
about it either.

52:42.600 --> 52:45.159
You had a miscarriage.

52:45.160 --> 52:47.891
That does not make you a failure.

52:49.200 --> 52:52.039
- Does it make me a success?

52:52.040 --> 52:53.040
- Sing.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.727
- I'm not singing about it.
- Sing about your miscarriage.

52:57.728 --> 52:58.640
- Is this a joke to you?

52:58.641 --> 52:59.926
- This is the furthest thing...
- Please, I...

52:59.927 --> 53:02.159
- From a joke to me.

53:02.160 --> 53:04.891
It's the one thing that
we don't talk about.

53:04.892 --> 53:07.359
And so I don't know how else to...

53:17.640 --> 53:19.290
♫ I

53:20.800 --> 53:23.929
♫ I failed as a woman

53:25.880 --> 53:29.930
♫ What happened is totally human

53:35.160 --> 53:37.199
Let's see this through.

53:37.200 --> 53:38.200
Okay?

53:41.920 --> 53:45.049
You're out of your own
way when you're up there.

53:45.050 --> 53:46.319
It's exciting.

53:46.320 --> 53:48.402
It's exciting for me to watch you.

53:48.403 --> 53:51.519
It's exciting for you to do.

53:51.520 --> 53:53.919
And we have something to share.

53:53.920 --> 53:55.410
We're doing it together.

53:55.411 --> 53:58.239
- No, I know, I like that.

53:58.240 --> 54:00.719
- So, it's a small hiccup.

54:00.720 --> 54:03.799
We go, we fuck up, we
try it again, we learn.

54:03.800 --> 54:05.245
- Yeah, I know, but I don't like that.

54:05.246 --> 54:07.039
The middle part, the...

54:07.040 --> 54:07.880
- It's all part

54:07.881 --> 54:08.720
of the process.
- The fuck up.

54:08.721 --> 54:09.846
- It's part of the process.
- I know.

54:09.847 --> 54:13.970
But it's just that, the
failing makes you a failure.

54:15.800 --> 54:18.159
- I don't think so.

54:18.160 --> 54:20.481
Failing makes you an artist.

54:27.200 --> 54:28.200
- Okay.

54:34.760 --> 54:35.602
' Hey.

54:35.603 --> 54:36.759
- Hey Dave.

54:36.760 --> 54:37.760
- Hi guys.

54:38.640 --> 54:40.369
- Look, we heard everything
you said the other night.

54:40.370 --> 54:43.125
- Yeah, and we're gonna
change, we promise.

54:43.126 --> 54:45.919
- We need you in our band.

54:45.920 --> 54:47.199
- No more fighting?

54:47.200 --> 54:48.040
- No more fighting.

54:48.041 --> 54:49.007
- Except in our songs.

54:49.008 --> 54:50.044
- Which are all fights.

54:50.045 --> 54:51.639
- To avoid really fighting.
- Yeah.

54:51.640 --> 54:52.924
- Do I still have to dress like a baby?

54:52.925 --> 54:53.762
- No.
- No.

54:53.763 --> 54:54.883
- No, in fact, I actually,

54:54.884 --> 54:56.359
I think this look works.
- Yeah.

54:56.360 --> 54:57.200
- You like this?

54:57.201 --> 54:58.087
- I love this.
- Yeah.

54:58.088 --> 54:59.764
- I don't know what, where it came from.

54:59.765 --> 55:02.519
But it's great.
- It's just my cozies.

55:02.520 --> 55:03.839
- Like...

55:03.840 --> 55:05.879
- That's so interesting.
- They're like pajamas?

55:05.880 --> 55:06.722
- Yeah.

55:06.723 --> 55:09.199
- That's very interesting.
- Very interesting.

55:09.200 --> 55:10.799
- Thanks.

55:10.800 --> 55:14.079
Well, I'm ready to gig if you guys are.

55:14.080 --> 55:15.199
- So are we.
- Let's do it.

55:15.200 --> 55:16.200
- Okay.

55:18.320 --> 55:19.479
Oh.

55:19.480 --> 55:20.970
What is the order?

55:22.160 --> 55:23.366
- It's just, I think
it's just a celebration.

55:23.367 --> 55:24.883
- Okay, cool.
- All right.

55:24.884 --> 55:26.211
One more thing.
- Yeah.

55:26.212 --> 55:30.399
- If we're gonna be a real
band, we need a band name.

55:34.400 --> 55:35.367
- A little of this.

55:40.680 --> 55:43.047
- Hi, we're The Dirty Dishes.

55:46.720 --> 55:48.722
One, two, three, four.

56:04.080 --> 56:07.479
♫ Please do not ask me
if you've gained weight

56:07.480 --> 56:11.199
♫ Especially when we're
goin' out on a date

56:11.200 --> 56:15.079
♫ I have no idea if you've
gained a pound of two

56:15.080 --> 56:19.319
♫ And even if I did I would not tell you

56:27.440 --> 56:29.044
♫ I

56:31.400 --> 56:32.526
- That's okay.

56:34.600 --> 56:36.599
♫ I hate my body

56:36.600 --> 56:38.648
♫ That's obvious 'cause I'm a woman

56:38.649 --> 56:40.519
♫ I'm also always hungry

56:40.520 --> 56:42.522
♫ Did I mention that I'm a woman

56:42.523 --> 56:46.119
♫ Eating is my only
source of true happiness

56:46.120 --> 56:48.282
♫ Pardon me if I wanna kill myself

56:48.283 --> 56:53.199
♫ When I don't fit in my dress
♫ You want me to lie, lie, lie

56:53.200 --> 56:57.079
♫ You want me to lie, lie, lie

56:57.080 --> 57:00.719
♫ I want to eat pie, pie, pie

57:00.720 --> 57:04.850
♫ But just look at my
thighs, thighs, thighs

57:05.840 --> 57:07.399
♫ Love

57:07.400 --> 57:09.050
♫ Is love

57:11.000 --> 57:13.002
♫ Is love

57:14.760 --> 57:16.679
♫ Is love

57:16.680 --> 57:18.887
♫ Is lying

57:23.720 --> 57:26.610
♫ Oh love and lies

58:22.684 --> 58:23.719
- Thank you.

58:32.800 --> 58:34.039
Do you like my jacket?

58:34.040 --> 58:35.159
- I love it.

58:35.160 --> 58:36.241
- I got it at Party City.

58:36.242 --> 58:37.890
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

58:37.880 --> 58:38.847
- They don't have clothing.
- Hey.

58:38.848 --> 58:41.359
So listen, I talked to
Crystal Vichycoisse.

58:41.360 --> 58:42.200
- Yeah.

58:42.201 --> 58:43.040
- And she had a pretty rough night.

58:43.041 --> 58:43.846
- Oh.

58:43.847 --> 58:44.682
- She acted out.

58:44.683 --> 58:47.119
She ended up having compulsive
sex with this 37-year-old.

58:47.120 --> 58:47.962
- Oh no.

58:47.963 --> 58:49.439
Is his age the problem or is it,

58:49.440 --> 58:50.327
no, it's the...
- It's this compulsion.

58:50.328 --> 58:51.479
She can't help it.
- Right.

58:51.480 --> 58:52.322
- She can't help it.

58:52.323 --> 58:53.639
- Right, she relapsed.

58:53.640 --> 58:55.210
- I mean, I don't even
know what they see in her.

58:55.211 --> 58:57.839
You know, I mean, she's just
so unappealing, you know,

58:57.840 --> 58:59.444
in the face, and the body, and everything.

58:59.445 --> 59:00.766
It must be her sense of humor.

59:00.767 --> 59:03.239
Anyway, this guy works for a record label.

59:03.240 --> 59:04.080
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh-huh.

59:04.081 --> 59:05.241
- And she brought him
to the show last night.

59:05.242 --> 59:06.999
- Shut up.
- That's awesome.

59:07.000 --> 59:07.965
- Are you being for real?

59:07.966 --> 59:08.802
- Yeah, and he really liked it.

59:08.803 --> 59:10.599
- Wow.

59:10.600 --> 59:12.090
- Yeah, he was really into it.

59:12.091 --> 59:13.639
- Dave, that's

59:13.640 --> 59:16.039
insane.
- That's awesome.

59:16.040 --> 59:18.759
- You look fuckin' hot.

59:18.760 --> 59:19.600
- What?

59:19.601 --> 59:20.485
- Yeah.

59:20.486 --> 59:21.288
- Whoa.

59:21.289 --> 59:24.239
- Like, if I didn't know you,
I'd wanna get to know you.

59:24.240 --> 59:25.080
- Who are you?

59:25.081 --> 59:26.809
Like, how are we gonna
keep writing fight songs

59:26.810 --> 59:29.485
if we never fight about anything anymore?

59:29.486 --> 59:32.079
- Well, we could write love songs.

59:36.000 --> 59:36.840
- Yeah, no.

59:36.841 --> 59:37.646
Let's skip that part.
- It just seems weird.

59:37.647 --> 59:38.480
Yeah.

59:38.481 --> 59:39.320
As soon as I said it...
- Yeah.

59:39.321 --> 59:40.287
- I was like, that is a bad idea.

59:40.288 --> 59:43.006
- Yeah, can we just, I
feel like we gotta get,

59:43.007 --> 59:44.805
just for our creative process, just,

59:44.806 --> 59:47.319
can you be a little bit more
of a dick to me this morning?

59:47.320 --> 59:48.559
- Okay, you want me to leave the room

59:48.560 --> 59:50.050
and come back as a dickhead?

59:50.051 --> 59:51.639
- Yeah.
- Yep, okay.

59:51.640 --> 59:52.679
<i>- Okay, you ready'?</i>

59:52.680 --> 59:53.520
You're gonna go

59:53.521 --> 59:54.405
on your own action.
- Comin' in hot.

59:54.406 --> 59:55.160
<i>'</i> Okay.

59:55.161 --> 59:56.207
- Have you seen my sneakers?

59:59.080 --> 01:00:00.241
- What do you think?

01:00:00.242 --> 01:00:01.765
- About what, my sneakers?

01:00:01.766 --> 01:00:03.199
I can't find 'em.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.168
- Do you like my outfit?

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.759
- Is this the only option?

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.639
- Wow.

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:13.959
That's like Brando or somethin'.

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:15.244
- Was that good?
- That's fuckin' insane

01:00:15.245 --> 01:00:16.205
that you can go...
- We're in a fight now,

01:00:16.206 --> 01:00:17.087
right?
- Yeah, oh yeah.

01:00:17.088 --> 01:00:18.491
We're certainly in a fight.

01:00:18.492 --> 01:00:22.399
- Right?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.242
I love you.

01:00:23.243 --> 01:00:24.730
- I love you, too.

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:26.766
- Oh my god, how long has it been

01:00:26.767 --> 01:00:28.410
since we've had a date night?

01:00:28.411 --> 01:00:30.279
- I don't know, never?

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:32.085
- Also, I can't believe
that this label dude

01:00:32.086 --> 01:00:33.161
is interested in us.

01:00:33.162 --> 01:00:34.805
- Hold on, being interested in something

01:00:34.806 --> 01:00:36.679
is different than being, you know,

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:38.409
committed to something.
- I know, it was just,

01:00:38.410 --> 01:00:39.481
that's so exciting,

01:00:39.482 --> 01:00:42.599
like things are finally happening for us.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:43.600
- TO US.

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:51.121
- Hey, maybe let's
celebrate a different way.

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:53.362
I don't know,

01:00:53.363 --> 01:00:56.489
I just feel like being
present for this right now.

01:00:56.490 --> 01:00:59.999
- Yeah, no, I wanna be present, too.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.161
I don't, we don't need...

01:01:01.162 --> 01:01:02.879
- Yeah.
- To smoke to celebrate.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:03.880
- Okay.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.399
How's your day going?

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:50.839
- You know when you meet
people, and you're like, oh.

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:00.727
- I have never
seen you two like this.

01:02:00.728 --> 01:02:02.799
- I know.

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.439
It's so awesome.

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:05.282
- I'm so happy for you.

01:02:05.283 --> 01:02:06.599
- Thank you.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:07.487
- It's amazing.

01:02:07.488 --> 01:02:09.959
- Okay, I think that's everything.

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:14.799
- Oh, babe, could you just
grab the spoons for dessert?

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.079
- What?

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.879
- The dessert spoons, honey.

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.445
- Right, yeah.
- For dessert, yeah.

01:02:20.446 --> 01:02:22.042
There you go.
- Okay, right, okay.

01:02:22.043 --> 01:02:23.246
- All right, thank you.

01:02:23.247 --> 01:02:24.399
All right.

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.959
Love you.

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:28.679
- So, what happens when
they go away like that?

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:29.884
- I'm not sure.
- Where do they go?

01:02:29.885 --> 01:02:30.720
- I don't know,

01:02:30.721 --> 01:02:32.404
but sometimes I wish he
would just stay there longer.

01:02:32.405 --> 01:02:34.039
You know, it gives me a break, too.

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:34.880
Can you...
- I feel bad.

01:02:34.881 --> 01:02:35.720
Tell me what else to do.
- No, no, no.

01:02:35.721 --> 01:02:36.799
Just go sit down.
- Are you sure?

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:37.642
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

01:02:37.643 --> 01:02:39.404
- Please, go sit down.

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:25.520
- Yes.

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.519
Take those off.

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:38.846
Come inside me.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:41.762
- What?

01:03:41.763 --> 01:03:44.199
- Don't pull out this time.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.200
I'm ready.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:46.842
I'm ready to try again.

01:03:46.843 --> 01:03:48.251
- That's like a bigger,

01:03:48.252 --> 01:03:50.129
that's like a bigger...

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:52.731
That's like, um.

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.205
- What?

01:03:56.123 --> 01:03:57.239
What's wrong?

01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:00.439
- Nothing, it's just, that's like a,

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:03.046
you know, a bigger conversation.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:06.642
- Okay.

01:04:06.643 --> 01:04:08.529
I mean, I just thought,

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:11.244
what are we...
- Yeah, I know, it's just...

01:04:11.245 --> 01:04:13.759
- What are we waiting for at this point?

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:14.759
- You're the one that didn't wanna.

01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:15.966
- I know, but that's what I'm saying.

01:04:15.967 --> 01:04:19.839
I'm saying that now I feel ready, finally.

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:24.004
And, you know, I feel happy
for the first time in so long.

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:26.119
You feel happy.

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:28.119
Look what's happening for us.

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.084
Like, we could get a record deal.

01:04:30.085 --> 01:04:31.366
You know?

01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:35.160
It's awesome.

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:38.800
What?

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:49.879
- We're not
getting a record deal.

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:51.689
- You don't know that.

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.839
- Oh shit.

01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:01.840
- What?

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:05.359
- What do you mean, what?

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:06.360
I knew it.

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.519
I knew exactly how this was gonna go.

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.360
Because I know the way

01:05:10.361 --> 01:05:11.599
that you looked at everything.
- Jesus, Ben.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:14.326
What is wrong with the way
that I looked at everything?

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:15.922
- Like it's some fuckin' life raft.

01:05:15.923 --> 01:05:19.204
- Well, what we're doing
is finally making us happy.

01:05:19.205 --> 01:05:21.521
- I've been happy.
- Oh please, Ben.

01:05:21.522 --> 01:05:23.325
- You've been in some dark depression.

01:05:23.326 --> 01:05:24.924
- You've always been happy?

01:05:24.925 --> 01:05:26.888
Give me a fucking break.

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:30.879
You were so checked out for so long.

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:32.689
You are like, you lie.

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:36.839
Fucking, is that happy?

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:39.922
- You think you're like
a piece of fuckin' cake?

01:05:39.923 --> 01:05:41.285
- I don't wanna do this.

01:05:41.286 --> 01:05:44.279
- Do you know what it's been like since,

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:48.410
I mean, since we lost the
baby, you've been a mess.

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:53.164
And I just keep putting up
with it because, I don't know,

01:05:53.165 --> 01:05:55.731
I hope one day the old you will come back.

01:05:55.732 --> 01:05:57.165
- The old me, Ben?

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:00.731
The old me was young and naive.

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:02.961
- The old you was happy.

01:06:02.962 --> 01:06:03.999
- I am happy.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:04.842
- You're weeping.

01:06:04.843 --> 01:06:07.639
- I'm fucking heartbroken.

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:11.039
Am I not allowed to have feelings?

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:13.646
- It's just, it's too, it's crazy.

01:06:13.647 --> 01:06:14.926
- What is crazy?

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:17.839
Fuck.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.283
Don't fucking walk away from me

01:06:19.284 --> 01:06:20.805
in the middle of a fucking talk.

01:06:20.806 --> 01:06:22.959
What is so crazy?

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:25.403
- How do you decide which
feeling you're gonna go with

01:06:25.404 --> 01:06:27.439
when they're so close together,

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:28.519
all these feelings...
- So fucking

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:29.519
passive-aggressive.
- That it must be

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:30.644
really difficult...
- You know what, Ben.

01:06:30.645 --> 01:06:31.560
- To decide, no, this is...
- Maybe...

01:06:31.561 --> 01:06:32.641
- What I'm feeling right now.
- I'm having feelings

01:06:32.642 --> 01:06:37.039
for the both of us, since
you don't seem to have any!

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.371
Like, where are you?

01:06:38.372 --> 01:06:41.599
You haven't cried once
since our miscarriage.

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:45.002
You haven't fucking felt anything with me.

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:48.085
- I know how to handle my feelings.

01:06:48.086 --> 01:06:50.559
- Oh, you mean just bury
them and let them fester?

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:51.839
- It's called being realistic.

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:52.840
- Realistic?

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:57.283
You just live in this
fuckin' state of denial.

01:06:57.284 --> 01:06:59.719
So yeah, okay, maybe
that's realistic for you.

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:00.687
But to the rest of the world,

01:07:00.688 --> 01:07:03.246
it just looks like you're
constantly refusing to deal.

01:07:03.247 --> 01:07:05.806
- No, it looks like there goes a person

01:07:05.807 --> 01:07:08.724
who knows how to be appropriate
with their emotions.

01:07:08.725 --> 01:07:11.679
Not what you've become, which is some,

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:15.844
honestly, sad, sniveling,
whining excuse for a woman.

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:23.159
- What is wrong with you?

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:24.160
- I'm sorry.

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:28.482
It's, this is why I didn't
wanna tell you tonight.

01:07:28.483 --> 01:07:30.199
Because I knew that it would be the end.

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:31.087
- The end of what?

01:07:31.088 --> 01:07:32.999
- The end of your freedom.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.319
Because for the last
I don't know how long,

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.890
you've seemed freedomy for the first time

01:07:37.891 --> 01:07:39.639
in a long time.
- I do, I feel that, too.

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:40.924
- That's such bullshit.
- I feel free.

01:07:40.925 --> 01:07:42.363
It's not bullshit.
- That is bullshit, Anna.

01:07:42.364 --> 01:07:43.930
Because you think this
is about a record deal?

01:07:43.931 --> 01:07:48.639
Did you really think we were
gonna get a record deal?

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:50.688
This is about you and me.

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:54.319
- I know.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:55.320
- Do you?

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.442
Because all that I see from here

01:07:59.443 --> 01:08:03.319
is someone who has been
walking a tightrope.

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:07.879
And I've never seen a tightrope
walker more excited to fall.

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:09.003
It makes no sense to me.

01:08:09.004 --> 01:08:11.199
- I can feel myself changing, Ben.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.531
- Oh, that is so crazy...
- I know that

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:13.407
about myself.
- For you to say.

01:08:13.408 --> 01:08:15.559
It's like, you hate change.

01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:17.560
Every time someone brings
up change, you shut down.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:18.402
- Oh please.

01:08:18.403 --> 01:08:20.002
That's classic coming from the guy

01:08:20.002 --> 01:08:22.443
who sits in his fucking underwear all day,

01:08:22.444 --> 01:08:24.919
just creating corporate
bullshit for a paycheck.

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:27.479
Like, where's the old you?

01:08:27.479 --> 01:08:29.359
Where's the fuckin' old you,

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:33.118
who used to make shit
that meant something?

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.479
- I am trying.

01:08:34.479 --> 01:08:37.238
I am trying.
- Define trying.

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:40.319
I mean, you can't keep a job
for more than three months.

01:08:40.319 --> 01:08:41.207
- People don't get me.

01:08:41.207 --> 01:08:42.281
- Oh please, Ben.

01:08:42.282 --> 01:08:46.319
This emo teenager shit
is so fucking tired.

01:08:46.319 --> 01:08:49.684
You know what, I think the
thing is everyone gets you,

01:08:49.685 --> 01:08:51.682
and that's the fuckin' problem.

01:08:51.683 --> 01:08:54.959
- Anna, you're an Uber driver.

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:58.760
You're an Uber driver
with a failed book deal.

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:02.559
We're fuckin' losers.

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:04.961
I don't know if you think there's
some kind of magical thing

01:09:04.962 --> 01:09:07.725
that's gonna come and change that for you.

01:09:07.725 --> 01:09:09.599
But this is it.

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.170
This is fuckin' it.

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:17.688
- If we had been able

01:09:17.689 --> 01:09:20.038
to have a baby.
- Don't.

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.999
- If we had had that baby.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.129
- Not having that baby was a blessing.

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:31.247
- How could you say that?

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:36.124
I want you to leave.

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:38.880
- Fuck.

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:43.279
- And don't fuckin' come back.

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:17.811
Dammit.

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:35.320
- Hey Dave.

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:37.607
- Hey.

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:42.281
- Do you think I could
spend the night here?

01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:45.762
- Yeah, yeah, come on in.

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:48.760
- Thanks.

01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:09.162
- Good morning, Benjamin.

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:12.209
- Good morning, Dave.

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:19.479
Good morning.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:20.367
- Hello.

01:11:20.368 --> 01:11:21.639
- Hi.

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:24.399
- This is called snuggle therapy.

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:26.959
The human touch is very healing.

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:28.405
- Well, thank you.

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:33.963
- I used to practice
snuggling with my parents

01:11:33.964 --> 01:11:35.722
in the aftermath of their divorce.

01:11:35.723 --> 01:11:39.247
Now, the patient's instinct
is to fight the snuggle.

01:11:39.248 --> 01:11:44.159
And I assure you, Benjamin, a
snuggle ought not be fought.

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:45.799
- Give snuggles a shot.

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.959
- I do, my phone is ringing,

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:49.644
so I do have to get it.
- I'll get it.

01:11:49.645 --> 01:11:51.599
- No, it might be Anna.

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:56.199
And I have kind of tight
pockets in these pants.

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:58.009
I'm just gonna get up.

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:03.360
Hi mom.

01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:04.407
- Will you get your ass over here

01:12:04.408 --> 01:12:05.923
so I can take care of you, please.

01:12:05.924 --> 01:12:07.206
- Okay, all right.

01:12:07.207 --> 01:12:09.009
I'll be over in a bit.

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:13.879
- Mother love is the deepest
love of all, isn't it?

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:14.880
- Yeah.

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:26.526
- I know I'm not perfect.

01:14:26.527 --> 01:14:30.719
But it's like, she's
just moody, demanding.

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:33.007
Obsessive and hypercritical.

01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:35.719
- That sounds about right.

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:38.371
' Yeah.

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:42.529
About a year ago, we had a miscarriage.

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:45.479
- What?

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.799
Oh honey, I'm so sorry.

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:50.406
- And I don't know, I feel like it's just,

01:14:50.407 --> 01:14:53.290
maybe we're just too broken to fix.

01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:59.525
- You know I had two miscarriages
before you were born?

01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:01.681
- No, I did not know that.

01:15:01.682 --> 01:15:03.648
- Yeah, it was horrible.

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:05.839
Really bad.

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:08.207
I mean, I thought I was never
gonna be able to have kids.

01:15:08.208 --> 01:15:09.799
And.

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:10.881
And then, of course, you know,

01:15:10.882 --> 01:15:15.359
the second your dad and I
stopped trying, we had you.

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:17.559
- Well, how did you guys get through it?

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:18.402
- We fought.

01:15:18.403 --> 01:15:20.399
We fought like crazy, like cats and dogs.

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:21.322
For years.

01:15:21.323 --> 01:15:22.879
Couples fight, what can I tell you?

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:24.370
You guys have been together for so long,

01:15:24.371 --> 01:15:25.686
it's almost impossible not to.

01:15:25.687 --> 01:15:27.489
- No, we really fight.
- Yeah.

01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:29.289
- And about dumb shit.

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:31.682
It's exhausting.

01:15:31.683 --> 01:15:32.920
- Yeah, I know.

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:35.359
You know what?

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:38.250
Let me give you a little
bit of advice about women.

01:15:38.251 --> 01:15:39.879
All right?

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:42.690
And I know what I'm talking about.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.719
Okay, so, hormonally,

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:48.243
we are just completely
different creatures.

01:15:48.244 --> 01:15:50.806
We might as well be
completely different species.

01:15:50.807 --> 01:15:53.451
You see us as overly
emotional, and that's true.

01:15:53.452 --> 01:15:57.570
We're constantly juggling a
lot of feeling and anxieties.

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:03.999
We have difficulty separating
ourselves from our problems.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:04.842
Do you understand?

01:16:04.843 --> 01:16:07.889
Like we're constantly looking
for the connective tissue

01:16:07.890 --> 01:16:10.839
to find a solution, we obsess.

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:15.599
We search for emotional cues

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:20.239
so that we could figure out the
meaning behind the unspoken.

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:22.288
It's not pretty in there.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.199
Problem is, we expect you to be the same.

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:33.319
Now, you, you could take
pleasure in simple things, right?

01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:35.639
A basketball game, a video game.

01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:37.559
Really, games of any kind.

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:38.527
- That's true.

01:16:38.528 --> 01:16:43.159
- And this ability to have
these simple pleasures,

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:45.527
it allows you to
compartmentalize your feelings

01:16:45.528 --> 01:16:47.279
in a very different way.

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:50.759
You could do what women
only dream of doing.

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:53.319
You could shut your mind off.

01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:54.651
And when your minds are turned off,

01:16:54.652 --> 01:16:56.003
you forget to do things, right?

01:16:56.004 --> 01:16:57.725
You forget to do the dishes.

01:16:57.726 --> 01:17:00.525
You forget to answer a
question when we ask it.

01:17:00.526 --> 01:17:02.519
- Anna calls it the 30 second delay.

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:03.362
- Uh-huh.

01:17:03.363 --> 01:17:05.681
And then we come at you
harder and stronger,

01:17:05.682 --> 01:17:07.967
'cause we want your respect and attention.

01:17:07.968 --> 01:17:11.559
'Cause we don't understand
your need to shut down,

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.005
your need to daydream.

01:17:13.006 --> 01:17:15.119
To us, it's lazy and selfish.

01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:16.685
- And that makes us so angry.

01:17:16.686 --> 01:17:18.762
- Mm-hmm, I know, that's the aggression.

01:17:18.763 --> 01:17:20.399
That's the testosterone.

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:21.561
And then we get hurt.

01:17:21.562 --> 01:17:22.886
That's the estrogen.

01:17:22.887 --> 01:17:24.928
- And then we get
divorced, and that's life.

01:17:24.929 --> 01:17:27.279
- Not necessarily, Benny.

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:28.247
You know, these are all things

01:17:28.248 --> 01:17:29.924
that I really wish I understood better

01:17:29.925 --> 01:17:32.399
before your father died.

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:35.879
Couples experience loss all the time

01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:37.919
in all different ways.

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:40.559
It's how you understand that loss,

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:43.323
how you navigate it
that makes a difference.

01:17:43.324 --> 01:17:45.125
- This feels a little reductive.

01:17:45.126 --> 01:17:47.361
- Yeah, I'm making
generalizations, obviously.

01:17:47.362 --> 01:17:50.639
But I'm basing them on
my marriage, my clients,

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:53.959
my friends' marriage, yours, it seems.

01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:55.642
I can't speak for the gays.

01:17:55.643 --> 01:17:56.843
- Or the trans community.

01:17:56.844 --> 01:17:59.486
- No, I'd only be basing
that on that show on Amazon.

01:17:59.487 --> 01:18:00.639
- So good.
- Yeah.

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:01.482
- It's so good.

01:18:01.483 --> 01:18:03.839
- But I will say this.

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:04.963
Even though you think of us

01:18:04.964 --> 01:18:06.928
as constantly talking about our feelings,

01:18:06.929 --> 01:18:09.159
we're holding so much in.

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:10.679
Our minds never stop.

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:13.639
Always analyzing, worrying.

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:16.919
I think if women could get more physical,

01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:19.287
and access our rage that way,

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:22.170
a lot would change.

01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:38.239
♫ I'm a cannonball

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:40.719
♫ I'm a grenade unreversible

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:43.719
♫ Burnin' through my head now

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:46.519
♫ Gotta get it out somehow

01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:47.879
♫ Get it out

01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:49.479
♫ Hey hey hey

01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:51.801
♫ Get it out

01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:56.239
♫ Yeah, I feel all right

01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:58.399
♫ I'm gonna do anything I like

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.559
♫ Burnin' through my head now

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:03.962
♫ Get it out, get it out

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:12.930
♫ Three, two, one

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:16.970
♫ One, two, three

01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:34.360
- Anna.

01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:42.880
Anna.

01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:45.520
Anna.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.479
- Hi.

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:27.686
My name's Anna.

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:33.527
This is a work in progress.

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:42.639
Sorry.

01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:43.640
Okay.

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:06.719
♫ We talk about it all but constant

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:10.199
♫ The wolf and the wolf's meal

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:13.999
♫ A girl, she grows up with no options

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.639
♫ But to trust how her gut feels

01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:21.719
♫ When mothers warn, we should be careful

01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:25.159
♫ We walk with our thighs pressed

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:29.119
♫ Our bodies learned to be fearful

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:33.011
♫ Every touch a dangerous test

01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:51.439
♫ A boy, he learns he must be stoic

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:55.039
♫ To earn his badge of pride

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:58.439
♫ To show his pain is not heroic

01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:02.359
♫ So he keeps it bottled up inside

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:06.079
♫ The pressure's much too much to handle

01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:09.719
♫ The struggle to provide

01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:13.519
♫ But history will not dismantle

01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:17.684
♫ The rules by which you must abide

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:35.639
♫ Growing up is all about

01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:39.239
♫ Learning how to live without

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:42.839
♫ The baggage of our lesser years

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:46.559
♫ Packed tight with
hurt and rage and tears

01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:49.959
♫ You and I, let's trace a map

01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:53.559
♫ Where we can bridge this gender gap

01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:57.039
♫ The destination's very near

01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:00.319
♫ We'll spend one night
in the town of fear

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:04.239
♫ Then drive past guilt, regret, and shame

01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:07.959
♫ To a town whose only precious name

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:10.959
♫ Is a rustling in the trees

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:14.959
♫ Under which we'll light a fire

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:18.759
♫ And listen to the wind

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:21.159
♫ Whisper

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:28.648
♫ Desire

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:44.320
- HEY-

01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:46.960
- Hi.

01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:06.608
- It's a work in progress.

01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:09.960
- I know.

01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:16.691
- I'm sorry, Anna.

01:27:16.692 --> 01:27:18.091
- I'm sorry, too.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.000
I love you.

01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:23.479
- I love you, too.

01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:37.160
- Okay.

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:43.362
- Writing session.
- Yeah.

01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:47.046
- How do you write

01:27:47.047 --> 01:27:48.881
a love song that's not like...
- I have no idea...

01:27:48.882 --> 01:27:50.006
- The corniest.
- How you do that.

01:27:50.007 --> 01:27:52.239
You know.

01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:55.079
- It just feels so overdone.

01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:58.129
- Yeah, I have so much
respect now for Babyface.

01:27:58.130 --> 01:27:59.679
- I know.
- You know.

01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:02.925
- I mean, I had a lot of respect

01:28:02.926 --> 01:28:03.726
for him before.
- No, no,

01:28:03.727 --> 01:28:04.560
he's a great musician.
- Yeah.

01:28:04.561 --> 01:28:05.607
Yeah.
- I'm just saying, I have

01:28:05.608 --> 01:28:09.764
a whole new level of respect.
- A whole new love, I know.

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:13.248
- I mean, the real question is...

01:28:13.249 --> 01:28:14.526
- What does love

01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:18.160
mean to you?

01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:51.039
♫ There was a time

01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:54.759
♫ I couldn't bear to be bare

01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:57.999
♫ I was swallowed up

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.999
♫ By the unfair

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.239
♫ But you came along

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:07.759
♫ My truth serum

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:10.599
♫ To repair

01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:13.239
♫ So we could repair

01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:17.325
♫ Love is more than a switch
that needs to be flipped

01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:21.559
♫ Yeah, love is a drip

01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:23.799
♫ One, two, three, four

01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:33.519
♫ It's a concrete mission

01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:37.039
♫ That certified friction

01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:40.559
♫ It takes precision

01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:44.159
♫ To avoid collision

01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:47.519
♫ Noble is this

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:50.999
♫ We're mister and missus

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.439
♫ We'll never dismiss

01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:58.159
♫ What it takes to make this

01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:00.049
♫ Love

01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:03.729
♫ Song

01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:07.049
♫ Love

01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:10.723
♫ Song

01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:13.930
♫ Love from different
planets, but it's good

01:30:13.931 --> 01:30:15.559
♫ It's trust no one, but you must trust

01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:17.244
♫ It's bendin' down
and grittin' your teeth

01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:19.082
♫ It's seein' what you think you've seen

01:30:19.083 --> 01:30:20.885
♫ It's putting out the daily fire

01:30:20.886 --> 01:30:22.722
♫ It's facing all the welcome desires

01:30:22.723 --> 01:30:24.479
♫ It's never shuttin' the bathroom door

01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:26.084
♫ Laughing inside, even when you're bored

01:30:26.085 --> 01:30:27.799
♫ It's finding new from the every day

01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:28.881
♫ It's fuckin' your brains out

01:30:28.882 --> 01:30:33.010
♫ Every which way
- One, two, three.

01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:36.719
♫ Love is a fight, fight

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:38.319
♫ A fight with you

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:41.119
♫ And that's the only love I know

01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:43.487
♫ To be true

01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:47.121
♫ I love you

01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:06.679
♫ You and I

01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:09.570
HI, I, I, I, I, I

01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:16.719
♫ We can fight

01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:20.850
♫ Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight

01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:28.519
♫ Try we might to find the light

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:31.091
♫ Try we might

01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:46.079
♫ You and I

01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:49.209
♫ I, I, I, I, I, I, I

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:56.119
♫ Get low, get high

01:31:56.120 --> 01:32:00.011
♫ High, high, high, high, high

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:05.399
♫ But by the by

01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:07.879
♫ Side by side

01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:10.531
♫ Still we find

01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:13.599
♫ We find the fight

01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:16.763
♫ Fight, fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight, fight

01:32:16.764 --> 01:32:18.279
♫ We find the fight

01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:21.719
♫ Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight

01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:23.399
♫ We find the fight

01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:26.799
♫ Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight

01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:28.719
♫ We find the fight

01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:31.919
♫ Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight

01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:34.759
♫ We find the fight
