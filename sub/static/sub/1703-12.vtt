00:09.843 --> 00:11.811
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland.

00:16.216 --> 00:19.208
You want to see your portrait
up on the walls at Langley someday?

00:19.285 --> 00:21.776
Find Walker.

00:21.855 --> 00:25.416
Walker's not even critical.
He's just a part, a piece, a pixel.

00:25.492 --> 00:30.452
There is a bigger, pernicious,
Abu Nazir-worthy plot out there,
and we have little time.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.589
Carrie...

00:32.665 --> 00:34.257
you're not yourself.

00:34.334 --> 00:38.464
She's bipolar. This explosion must have
sent her into a flight.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.472
Carrie said something interesting.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.565
Sniper attack-

00:42.642 --> 00:44.405
that doesn't make sense for Abu Nazir.

00:44.477 --> 00:46.104
It's not his methodology.

00:46.179 --> 00:48.909
Well, maybe it is when he has a military
sniper working for him.

00:48.982 --> 00:50.449
She thinks something bigger.

00:53.720 --> 00:59.124
<i>The switch is here. Wait until</i>
<i>the last second before you open it.</i>

00:59.192 --> 01:02.355
I read that part of the blast goes upward.
Toward here.

01:02.429 --> 01:04.453
Point of weakness.

01:04.531 --> 01:06.795
- Hello?
- I'm calling about Abu Nazir.

01:06.866 --> 01:09.994
<i>Something happened to him- a tragedy.</i>

01:10.070 --> 01:13.096
You were with him then.
Y-You have insight.

01:13.173 --> 01:15.107
- Would it help if we met?
- I'm home.

01:15.175 --> 01:16.472
Stay there.

01:19.112 --> 01:21.842
Sergeant Brody called me.
He told me everything.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.974
Your office at Langley's
being cleared as we speak.

01:24.050 --> 01:26.644
I am about to solve this fucking thing!

01:26.719 --> 01:28.687
- Strip it.
- <i>I'm so sorry.</i>

01:28.755 --> 01:30.518
<i>I feel responsible in a way.</i>

01:30.590 --> 01:34.390
'Cause when you came back
from Baghdad, I knew.

01:34.461 --> 01:36.622
You were damaged.

01:36.696 --> 01:38.664
There's no time, Saul.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.535
It's high purple.

01:48.308 --> 01:51.004
My name is Nicholas Brody...

01:52.345 --> 01:55.872
and I'm a sergeant
in the United States Marine Corps.

01:58.051 --> 02:00.019
I have a wife...

02:01.187 --> 02:03.382
and two kids...

02:04.791 --> 02:06.816
who I love.

02:11.498 --> 02:14.194
By the time you watch this...

02:14.267 --> 02:17.600
you'll have read
a lot of things about me...

02:17.670 --> 02:20.298
about what I've done.

02:20.373 --> 02:23.035
And so I wanted to explain myself...

02:23.943 --> 02:26.104
so that you'll know the truth.

02:28.681 --> 02:32.447
On May 19, 2003...

02:32.519 --> 02:37.684
as part of a two-man sniper team serving
in Operation Iraqi Freedom...

02:37.757 --> 02:42.990
I was taken prisoner
by forces loyal to Saddam Hussein.

02:43.062 --> 02:47.897
Those forces then sold me
to an Al-Qaeda commander, Abu Nazir...

02:47.967 --> 02:51.733
who was operating a terrorist cell
from across the Syrian border...

02:51.804 --> 02:56.298
where I was held captive
for more than eight years.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.813
I was beaten...

03:02.382 --> 03:04.748
I was tortured...

03:06.286 --> 03:09.778
and I was subjected
to long periods of total isolation.

03:13.893 --> 03:17.260
People will say I was broken...

03:17.330 --> 03:20.458
I was brainwashed.

03:20.533 --> 03:24.629
People will say that I was
turned into a terrorist...

03:24.704 --> 03:27.400
taught to hate my country.

03:30.877 --> 03:35.041
I love my country.

03:36.416 --> 03:40.045
What I am is a marine...

03:40.119 --> 03:44.055
like my father before me
and his father before him.

03:44.123 --> 03:47.615
And as a marine, I swore an oath...

03:47.694 --> 03:50.788
to defend the United States of America
against enemies...

03:50.863 --> 03:53.855
both foreign and domestic.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.537
My action this day...

03:58.605 --> 04:02.234
is against such domestic enemies-

04:02.308 --> 04:04.572
the vice president...

04:04.644 --> 04:06.805
and members of his
national security team...

04:06.879 --> 04:10.906
who I know to be liars
and war criminals...

04:10.984 --> 04:15.216
responsible for atrocities
they were never held accountable for.

04:17.557 --> 04:23.621
This is about justice for 82 children...

04:23.696 --> 04:26.961
whose deaths were never acknowledged...

04:27.033 --> 04:31.231
and whose murder
is a stain on the soul of this nation.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.437
Hi.

04:37.744 --> 04:40.508
- Any change?
- Afraid not.

04:48.721 --> 04:51.155
How worried should we be?

04:51.224 --> 04:53.089
Worried.

04:53.159 --> 04:55.491
I haven't seen her like this
in a long time.

04:55.561 --> 04:59.554
She's not eating.
She hasn't left her room in three days.

05:05.004 --> 05:07.700
What about the lithium?

05:07.774 --> 05:10.038
I thought you said
that'd be kicking in by now.

05:10.109 --> 05:11.906
It has kicked in.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.412
This is the depression
that comes in the wake of the mania.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.608
It's actually much harder to treat.

05:17.684 --> 05:20.448
Think some chicken soup would help?

05:20.520 --> 05:22.385
It might.

05:23.456 --> 05:25.549
Elixir of the gods.

05:27.293 --> 05:29.284
- Can I go see her?
- Of course.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.354
Saul.

05:32.699 --> 05:35.429
What does being
on administrative leave mean exactly?

05:39.205 --> 05:41.867
Well...

05:41.941 --> 05:45.342
she's not gonna face any criminal charges,
thank God.

05:46.212 --> 05:48.146
But we shouldn't kid ourselves.

05:48.214 --> 05:51.706
She's never gonna
set foot in Langley again.

06:04.097 --> 06:05.587
Hey, you.

06:06.432 --> 06:08.662
Hey, Mr. Berenson.

06:10.570 --> 06:13.004
Remember when I used to call you that?

06:13.072 --> 06:14.266
What?

06:17.009 --> 06:19.239
Mr. Berenson.

06:19.312 --> 06:21.678
Yeah.

06:21.748 --> 06:23.807
A long-ass time ago.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.313
Back when I could still
piss in a straight line.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.855
How are you, Carrie?

06:34.494 --> 06:36.962
I've been better.

06:37.029 --> 06:39.429
Don't worry. I can't stay long.

06:51.444 --> 06:53.742
Why don't you tell me a story?

06:53.813 --> 06:56.043
What kind of a story?

06:59.385 --> 07:01.979
About a bad man named Nazir...

07:02.054 --> 07:03.954
took a break from doing bad things...

07:04.023 --> 07:05.991
only nobody could figure out why.

07:06.058 --> 07:08.583
You know I can't talk about that.

07:08.661 --> 07:10.151
I know.

07:10.229 --> 07:13.130
Until my security clearance is restored.
I know.

07:15.234 --> 07:17.725
You need to concentrate on getting better.

07:20.306 --> 07:23.070
At least tell me that
you're still looking into it...

07:24.143 --> 07:26.134
that you won't give up looking.

07:27.046 --> 07:29.173
Will you promise me that?

07:30.416 --> 07:32.008
Promise.

07:54.006 --> 07:55.940
No, don't go.

08:03.015 --> 08:05.108
Why did he do it?

08:06.686 --> 08:07.710
Who?

08:08.521 --> 08:10.182
Brody.

08:13.926 --> 08:15.450
Why?

08:19.265 --> 08:20.994
Do what?

08:21.868 --> 08:23.859
Call Estes and...

08:24.670 --> 08:26.831
rat me out like that.

08:28.407 --> 08:30.932
Honestly, I can think of
a hundred reasons.

08:31.944 --> 08:34.071
The man's running for Congress...

08:35.147 --> 08:37.138
in case you forgot.

08:38.451 --> 08:40.316
Think about it.

08:40.385 --> 08:44.152
You're the last person
he needs in his life right now.

08:44.757 --> 08:46.748
And vice versa.

08:50.263 --> 08:52.288
- But, Saul-
- Listen to me.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.856
This man has poisoned your thoughts.

08:56.269 --> 08:59.170
He has cost you almost everything.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.567
Forget him.

09:03.476 --> 09:06.468
I can't, Saul. I can't.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.810
My God.

09:15.821 --> 09:17.982
You're in love with him.

11:11.470 --> 11:15.270
Here goes. It's number O-72.

11:21.447 --> 11:23.711
B-15.

11:36.095 --> 11:38.893
Good night, Isabel.

11:39.965 --> 11:41.694
Good night.

12:03.889 --> 12:06.619
I'm looking at a lot of
distinguished faces here tonight.

12:08.427 --> 12:12.261
Yours, Elizabeth,
the only reason I'm here at all.

12:12.331 --> 12:17.633
Thank you for convincing me three years ago
to accept the nomination for vice president.

12:17.703 --> 12:19.534
Hear, hear.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.999
And yours, Richard.

12:23.075 --> 12:27.375
You are the core of what I'm confident
will be our next administration.

12:27.446 --> 12:30.472
We've all been on a long,
difficult journey.

12:30.549 --> 12:33.484
But tomorrow morning,
when I announce my candidacy...

12:33.552 --> 12:35.383
we will throw down a gauntlet-

12:36.255 --> 12:38.189
all of us here in this room-

12:38.257 --> 12:40.782
promising to put America first again.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.657
Hear, hear.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.298
Good to see you, Walt.

12:52.371 --> 12:54.805
- Are you ever gonna leave me?
- No.

12:55.708 --> 12:58.233
Very nice.

12:58.310 --> 13:01.245
You know, you're right.
It's a distinguished group.

13:01.313 --> 13:03.406
Includes you, David.

13:03.482 --> 13:06.349
It's a group worth protecting.
That's my point.

13:06.418 --> 13:09.046
If you're asking me to call off tomorrow,
you know the answer.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.282
I'm only suggesting
that we change the venue.

13:11.357 --> 13:14.224
So I can announce the candidacy
from some hiding place?

13:16.862 --> 13:19.330
You give them too much credit.
You know that?

13:19.398 --> 13:21.889
- Who's that, sir?
- The enemy. Guys like Walker.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.958
He can do a lot of damage.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.397
To both of us.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.464
Yes, he can.

13:32.511 --> 13:35.503
But he's only one guy...

13:35.581 --> 13:40.382
and you have the entire Homeland Security
apparatus at your disposal.

13:41.554 --> 13:45.388
For both our sakes, take care of it.

13:45.457 --> 13:49.393
And for God sakes, drink your champagne.
It's Billecart-Salmon.

13:49.461 --> 13:51.486
Yes, sir.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.993
Oh, not again.

14:09.648 --> 14:12.242
- I'm sorry, ma'am, but-
- I know. I know.

14:12.318 --> 14:14.479
Residents only.

14:14.553 --> 14:17.920
- What's it this time?
- It's a major policy address in the morning.

14:17.990 --> 14:20.322
- Vice president, I think.
- Oh, fucker.

14:20.392 --> 14:22.087
Ma'am?

14:22.161 --> 14:26.723
Serves me right for buying two blocks
from the State Department.

14:29.001 --> 14:31.060
Well, I'm sorry for the inconvenience,
Mrs. Samler.

14:31.136 --> 14:34.902
You have a nice night. Officers.

14:53.259 --> 14:55.193
Okay, Mrs. Samler.

14:58.264 --> 14:59.788
Knock, knock.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.925
Your night nurse is here.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.264
I made spaghetti Amatriciana.

15:07.806 --> 15:10.468
You know, Carrie,
you're gonna have to eat sooner or later.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.314
Damn it, Carrie.
You are starting to scare me.

15:21.387 --> 15:25.221
Go... away.

15:25.291 --> 15:27.122
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

15:27.192 --> 15:30.753
Your sister gave me very strict orders.

15:30.829 --> 15:33.992
So I'm gonna sit here with you
until you fall asleep.

15:34.066 --> 15:35.124
Okay?

15:35.200 --> 15:38.533
Hmm. Smells good.

15:40.339 --> 15:42.330
You sure you don't want a bite?

15:50.249 --> 15:53.582
Chris, can you get
the butter out of the fridge?
- Yeah.

15:53.652 --> 15:56.416
So you're not coming to my karate match?

15:56.488 --> 16:00.219
Buddy, I told you.
I got this event with the vice president.

16:00.292 --> 16:03.352
- I'm sorry.
- Chris, we talked about this, right?

16:03.429 --> 16:05.659
Your dad will go to the next one. Right?

16:05.731 --> 16:07.255
Right.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.699
All right. Dinner's ready.
Everybody sit down.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.210
- Whose turn is it to say grace?
- Mine.

16:21.580 --> 16:23.548
Dad, do you even know how to do it?

16:23.615 --> 16:25.606
I think I can fake it.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.820
Dear God...

16:35.894 --> 16:37.885
bless this food to thy use...

16:37.963 --> 16:41.399
and our lives to thy service.

16:41.467 --> 16:44.732
And may you shine the light
of your love on this family...

16:47.106 --> 16:49.199
hold them close...

16:51.877 --> 16:54.243
and protect them always.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.076
Amen.

16:57.149 --> 16:59.310
- Amen.
- Amen.

17:01.620 --> 17:03.485
- How'd I do?
- Not bad.

18:43.322 --> 18:45.882
<i>The end of our lives is preordained.</i>

18:45.958 --> 18:48.927
We are not created for no reason.

18:48.994 --> 18:52.725
We are only finding the path
we are meant to walk on.

18:54.199 --> 18:56.224
So purify your soul.

18:56.301 --> 18:58.326
Forget about the physical world...

18:58.403 --> 19:02.965
<i>and take the time left</i>
<i>to offer good deeds and obedience.</i>

19:06.578 --> 19:11.675
<i>Remember, all of life's wasted time</i>
<i>is behind you now.</i>

19:13.185 --> 19:15.619
<i>And the way forward is clear.</i>

19:17.923 --> 19:22.986
<i>You were looking at the battle</i>
<i>before you engaged in it...</i>

19:23.061 --> 19:25.757
<i>and now you see it with your own eyes.</i>

19:43.015 --> 19:45.506
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

19:56.562 --> 19:57.756
Dad.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.923
What are you doing? What's going on?

20:06.572 --> 20:08.870
How long have you been standing there?

20:13.045 --> 20:14.103
Dana?

20:16.648 --> 20:18.616
Dad, you're scaring me.

20:18.684 --> 20:20.948
Don't be scared.

20:22.120 --> 20:24.111
Was that Arabic?

20:24.189 --> 20:25.679
Yeah.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.790
What does it mean?

20:33.899 --> 20:35.958
It means, uh...

20:42.274 --> 20:44.504
I converted to Islam.

20:59.324 --> 21:03.556
I didn't say anything to anyone
because I didn't want to upset you guys.

21:05.797 --> 21:08.027
Well, then it's a good thing
you didn't shoot a deer...

21:08.100 --> 21:10.864
or step out on Mom,
or beat the shit out of Mike.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.927
Okay. I deserve that.

21:18.477 --> 21:22.675
Why do you wash your hands
and feet like that?

21:22.748 --> 21:24.306
It's a ritual.

21:24.383 --> 21:29.446
It's about purifying your mind and body
before presenting yourself to God.

21:36.595 --> 21:38.756
Does Mom know anything about any of this?

21:40.799 --> 21:42.699
No.

21:42.768 --> 21:45.498
She wouldn't get it at all.

21:49.441 --> 21:51.739
Our little secret then?

21:56.648 --> 21:57.672
Yeah.

22:08.193 --> 22:11.356
<i>These are the kind of issues facing</i>
<i>Vice President Walden this morning...</i>

22:11.430 --> 22:13.455
<i>as he prepares to give his remarks.</i>

22:13.532 --> 22:16.194
<i>The vice president will be</i>
<i>joined by staunch supporters...</i>

22:16.268 --> 22:19.328
<i>from virtually every corner</i>
<i>of the defense establishment...</i>

22:19.404 --> 22:21.804
<i>including the secretaries</i>
<i>of defense and state...</i>

22:21.873 --> 22:23.670
<i>and the Joint Chiefs of Staff...</i>

22:23.742 --> 22:25.767
<i>longtime adviser Elizabeth Gaines.</i>

22:25.844 --> 22:30.975
<i>The speech comes just days after</i>
<i>a bombing in downtown Washington</i>
<i>left five people dead...</i>

22:31.049 --> 22:32.812
<i>and it's clearly timed to show-</i>

22:32.884 --> 22:35.580
<i>...in the next phase of the war on terror.</i>

22:35.654 --> 22:39.283
<i>Yet the exact nature of</i>
<i>those measures remains unclear.</i>

22:39.358 --> 22:41.792
<i>At the C.I.A.,</i>
<i>Walden was widely credited...</i>

22:41.860 --> 22:44.920
<i>for developing closer ties</i>
<i>with the armed forces...</i>

22:44.996 --> 22:48.159
<i>taking a more militarized approach</i>
<i>to intelligence gathering...</i>

22:48.233 --> 22:50.497
<i>and the elimination of insurgents.</i>

22:50.569 --> 22:53.663
- <i>Under Walden's leadership,</i>
<i>the use of drone strikes-</i>
- Virgil.

22:53.739 --> 22:56.640
<i>Became a key strategy</i>
<i>in the C.I.A. 's fight-</i>

22:56.708 --> 22:59.541
Virgil, where are my pills? I need them!

22:59.611 --> 23:03.308
<i>Vice President Walden has met</i>
<i>with political resistance-</i>

23:03.382 --> 23:05.509
Virgil? Is anyone there?

23:05.584 --> 23:07.347
Carrie?

23:07.419 --> 23:09.478
I'm right here.

23:09.554 --> 23:11.044
Here.

23:27.939 --> 23:29.907
I need to get out of here.

23:29.975 --> 23:32.205
Good. Uh, great.

23:32.277 --> 23:34.302
We'll go for a walk.

23:35.914 --> 23:38.075
I want to go for a drive.

23:52.130 --> 23:54.621
What are you doing here? You're supposed
to be at the State Department.

23:54.699 --> 23:58.191
- I need your help with something first.
- What is that?

23:58.270 --> 24:01.762
There's an 11 -month gap
in Abu Nazir's activities.

24:01.840 --> 24:04.172
Started around two years ago.

24:05.710 --> 24:10.875
He goes silent,
like he fell off the face of the Earth.

24:10.949 --> 24:14.544
Theory is there might have been
some event that precipitated this-

24:14.619 --> 24:17.645
something that hit him personally,
took him out of action for a while.

24:17.722 --> 24:19.656
And whose theory is that?

24:21.726 --> 24:23.717
Just look at this.

24:27.666 --> 24:29.725
It's all redacted.
What the hell am I looking at?

24:29.801 --> 24:31.735
I think it's a drone strike.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.505
Why's that?

24:36.575 --> 24:39.043
This reference number here.

24:42.581 --> 24:44.572
- How'd you find this?
- Grid search.

24:44.649 --> 24:49.848
Cross-referenced with Abu Nazir's likely
locations around the time in question...

24:49.921 --> 24:52.355
and I got hundreds of hits.

24:53.458 --> 24:55.255
None like this.

24:56.895 --> 24:58.863
Can I ask why you were even doing that?

24:58.930 --> 25:01.592
I told you. There's a gap.

25:03.401 --> 25:07.303
This gap- is it related to that wall of
garbage we found in Carrie's apartment?

25:07.372 --> 25:10.205
- It was a timeline, David.
- It was classified material, Saul...

25:10.275 --> 25:12.038
improperly removed from this office...

25:12.110 --> 25:14.101
assembled by a crazy woman
into a crazy collage...

25:14.179 --> 25:16.306
and I don't even want to know
about your involvement in it.

25:16.381 --> 25:18.906
Well, ask me.

25:18.984 --> 25:21.680
- I'll tell ya.
- I said I don't even want to know.

25:21.753 --> 25:24.688
I need you too much right now
to have you land in custody.

25:26.992 --> 25:28.960
I-I need you to do your job.

25:30.028 --> 25:32.462
- I think I am.
- You're not.

25:32.531 --> 25:35.295
The vice president is hosting
a highly visible conference today.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.801
I asked you to be our man
on the ground there.

25:37.869 --> 25:39.894
Go do it.

25:49.147 --> 25:50.910
This is good.

25:50.982 --> 25:52.950
Excellent! I can't feel my hands.

25:53.919 --> 25:56.012
We ought to sic him on Tom Walker.

25:56.087 --> 25:58.112
- This is good.
- Okay. Let's go.

25:58.189 --> 26:00.487
We're gonna be late.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.754
- Sure you don't want to come?
- Well, I want to.

26:02.827 --> 26:06.285
- Then do.
- Come on, guys. We settled this already.

26:12.370 --> 26:15.305
- Next time.
- Sure.

26:18.610 --> 26:21.443
Hey. Come on. Hey.

26:21.513 --> 26:24.539
Come on, Bruce Lee.
You're gonna miss your bout.

26:24.616 --> 26:26.345
- You got everything?
- Yeah.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.783
Jess.

26:27.852 --> 26:30.343
We're gonna be late.
I'll see you later.

26:42.767 --> 26:44.667
The turn's right up here.

26:45.737 --> 26:47.671
Just going for a little drive, huh?

26:47.739 --> 26:49.639
We're driving, aren't we?

26:49.708 --> 26:51.972
Yeah.

26:56.848 --> 26:59.840
Great. You want to tell me
what the hell we're doing here?

26:59.918 --> 27:01.715
Getting some fresh air.

27:01.786 --> 27:05.745
No, I'm serious, Carrie. I have a van full
of equipment, a lot of it not exactly legal.

27:05.824 --> 27:07.485
So why are we here?

27:10.428 --> 27:11.986
- Carrie.
- In a few hours...

27:12.063 --> 27:14.896
the vice president's expected to announce
he's a candidate for president.

27:14.966 --> 27:16.900
Okay.

27:16.968 --> 27:21.166
Up ahead in that building
he'll be surrounded by his entire team.

27:21.239 --> 27:22.729
I said why are <i>we</i> here?

27:22.807 --> 27:25.173
Half the government's
gonna be in one spot...

27:25.243 --> 27:27.268
and we've got a terrorist on the loose.

27:27.345 --> 27:31.042
- And you think this is the target.
- I think it's worth considering.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.385
Okay, Carrie. Look.

27:35.453 --> 27:38.251
First of all,
<i>we</i> don't have a terrorist on the loose.

27:38.323 --> 27:40.257
We don't have anything.
You see these guys?

27:40.325 --> 27:43.783
They have a terrorist on the loose, and
it's their job to do something about it.

27:43.862 --> 27:46.228
- It's <i>my</i> job.
- Not anymore it's not.

27:46.297 --> 27:48.891
It'll always be my job.
Don't you get that?

27:51.903 --> 27:53.598
Look around, Carrie.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.833
There is security up the wazoo here.

27:55.907 --> 27:57.898
They are on it. We are not needed.

27:57.976 --> 28:00.706
No, all those guys-

28:00.779 --> 28:02.804
they're thinking it's a single sniper.

28:02.881 --> 28:06.476
- Because that's what it is.
- No, it's not. It doesn't make sense.

28:12.957 --> 28:14.982
Virgil, I-

28:17.996 --> 28:19.987
I know I'm not wanted.

28:20.065 --> 28:24.058
I know it's just us
in this stupid van, but...

28:24.135 --> 28:28.572
I'm the same person I've always been,
and I need you to be on my side now.

28:30.141 --> 28:32.575
I need you to say yes.

28:39.484 --> 28:40.974
Okay.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.586
Come on.
You gotta back it out. Let's go.

28:44.656 --> 28:47.716
Sorry. Made a wrong turn.

28:47.792 --> 28:50.192
Find a place to park this thing.

30:06.037 --> 30:09.529
- Just a minute.
- The door's locked.

30:09.607 --> 30:11.598
I'm getting dressed.

30:22.253 --> 30:25.916
Dad, I really don't think
you should go to this thing today.

30:29.994 --> 30:31.985
This thing...

30:33.298 --> 30:36.062
is being hosted by the vice president.

30:36.134 --> 30:37.795
So?

30:37.869 --> 30:39.393
So...

30:42.173 --> 30:44.164
he's counting on me.

30:47.612 --> 30:49.273
To be there.

30:51.749 --> 30:55.241
All they're saying
on the TV is how intense the security is.

30:55.320 --> 30:58.448
The most since the inauguration-
that's what they're saying.

30:59.757 --> 31:02.191
Well, then it's all taken care of.

31:02.260 --> 31:04.285
We have nothing to worry about.

31:07.365 --> 31:09.299
I guess.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.000
Dad.

31:13.071 --> 31:15.005
What?

31:15.073 --> 31:18.634
Have you noticed how awkward it is having
this conversation through the door?

31:42.500 --> 31:44.832
I think I heard my car arrive.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.871
Will you let 'em know
I'll be a couple minutes?

31:50.608 --> 31:54.100
Seeing you praying like that last night-
I think it kind of freaked me out.

31:54.178 --> 31:55.873
Apparently.

31:55.947 --> 31:59.314
As if it's not enough that Tom Walker
is running around out there with a gun.

31:59.384 --> 32:01.716
You're safe.

32:01.786 --> 32:03.344
Don't worry.

32:03.421 --> 32:05.514
It's not me that I'm worried about.

32:08.459 --> 32:10.188
I'll be fine.

32:11.729 --> 32:13.458
Two minutes.

33:03.781 --> 33:06.249
I still think that you should stay here.

33:08.486 --> 33:10.477
Be good.

33:13.424 --> 33:15.824
Sergeant Brody.

33:15.893 --> 33:17.884
- Who are you?
- Kandarian.

33:17.962 --> 33:21.420
Secret Service.
I've been assigned to you for the day.

33:23.601 --> 33:26.502
Let's go.

33:53.464 --> 33:57.423
Saul Berenson found a redacted document
that points to the mission.

34:01.305 --> 34:03.466
I thought that paper trail was burned.

34:03.541 --> 34:05.805
You and me both.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.742
What was he even looking for?

34:07.812 --> 34:09.780
He was just fishing...

34:09.847 --> 34:13.304
for some action that might have caused Abu
Nazir to drop out of sight around that time.

34:13.384 --> 34:18.014
- Based on what?
- Some theory he has that the
current situation is blowback.

34:18.089 --> 34:21.114
You tell him it doesn't matter
why terrorists do what they do.

34:21.192 --> 34:24.592
- I have.
- He's a security expert.
He's not a fucking social worker.

34:24.661 --> 34:27.927
- I know. I told him to drop it.
- Don't tell him. Make it happen.

34:27.998 --> 34:29.989
This cannot get out.

34:31.101 --> 34:32.592
Right?

34:35.773 --> 34:39.174
Operation wasn't above my security
clearance. It was off the books.

34:39.243 --> 34:41.210
Or it was taken off after the fact.

34:41.279 --> 34:43.213
Yeah, well, you're right.

34:43.281 --> 34:45.215
The reference number
implies a drone strike.

34:45.283 --> 34:49.014
So, there's gotta be all kinds of
supporting documentation, yes?

34:49.087 --> 34:51.021
That's the weird thing. There's not.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.717
- You check flight plans?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

34:53.791 --> 34:56.760
- What about ops tapes?
- I went down and checked the vault myself.

34:56.828 --> 35:01.629
The only thing that exists is this redacted
document you found on the grid search.

35:01.699 --> 35:04.463
- It probably wasn't even supposed to be there.
- Obviously.

35:04.535 --> 35:07.299
I'm stuck here like
some school crossing guard...

35:07.371 --> 35:09.635
just so Estes can feel like
his ass is covered.

35:09.707 --> 35:12.335
You want me to initiate
an official request for information?

35:12.410 --> 35:14.878
No. I have a feeling that's
the last thing we want to do.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.675
<i>I could reach out to some drone pilots.</i>

35:16.747 --> 35:18.237
Sir.

35:18.316 --> 35:20.341
Sorry.

35:20.418 --> 35:23.387
No, let's not raise flags.
I'll follow up on it myself.

35:33.231 --> 35:35.062
So, what are we looking for exactly?

35:35.133 --> 35:37.328
Exactly I don't know.

35:37.401 --> 35:40.529
It's not one thing, Virgil.
It's everything.

35:40.605 --> 35:44.701
All the defense leaders will be here-
at least two dozen high-value targets.

35:44.775 --> 35:48.802
- Yeah, so?
- So a single sniper
is not gonna take them all out.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.871
So you focus on the highest value target.

35:50.948 --> 35:53.439
Why here, with all this security?

35:53.518 --> 35:55.918
That's exactly what I've been saying.

35:58.322 --> 36:01.883
You attack here if you're planning
to take them all out.

36:01.959 --> 36:05.224
A group of people who are almost never
in the same place at the same time.

36:17.608 --> 36:19.439
<i>I'd really rather</i>
<i>talk about this conference...</i>

36:19.510 --> 36:23.037
<i>and our need to rededicate our efforts</i>
<i>to the War on Terror.</i>

36:23.114 --> 36:26.606
<i>Is that a course that</i>
<i>the vice president would pursue</i>
<i>as commander in chief?</i>

36:26.684 --> 36:29.209
<i>Well, he'll be here shortly.</i>
<i>You can ask him yourself.</i>

36:29.287 --> 36:31.687
<i>But the fact is we are not</i>
<i>comfortable with a war-</i>

37:29.180 --> 37:31.842
- We're on the wrong side
of the barrier, Virgil.
- I agree.

37:31.916 --> 37:33.941
Now come on. Let's go home.

37:34.018 --> 37:35.952
Carrie, you are
working yourself up for nothing.

37:36.020 --> 37:38.318
- I wouldn't call a possible
terrorist attack nothing.
- Shh!

37:38.389 --> 37:41.017
You can't say stuff like that. Not here.

37:41.092 --> 37:44.550
Don't worry. Everything's fine.
Is that what you want to hear?

37:56.340 --> 37:58.365
It's a bit excessive, isn't it?
All this security?

38:01.412 --> 38:03.607
Windows open, please.

38:04.715 --> 38:06.205
I.D.'s?

38:20.998 --> 38:23.330
Sergeant Brody.

38:23.401 --> 38:24.993
Sure.

38:25.069 --> 38:27.060
Sorry about the inconvenience.

38:28.339 --> 38:30.432
Good to go.

38:58.469 --> 39:00.994
Brody?

39:01.072 --> 39:03.700
- What's he doing here?
- Uh, do me a favor. Don't ask him.

39:06.110 --> 39:08.738
I'm standing here because of him.
I lost my job because of him.

39:08.813 --> 39:10.838
Carrie, we really should go now.

39:13.117 --> 39:15.984
Carrie. Goddamn it, Carrie.

39:33.637 --> 39:35.161
Nervous?

39:35.239 --> 39:37.230
Well...

39:37.308 --> 39:40.835
I'll be standing in there
with two cabinet secretaries...

39:40.911 --> 39:43.903
couple of Joint Chiefs,
head of Defense Intelligence.

39:45.349 --> 39:47.510
I'm just a platoon sergeant.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.415
You'll get used to it.

39:52.857 --> 39:54.347
He's here.

40:26.524 --> 40:28.014
- Sergeant Brody.
- Sir.

40:28.092 --> 40:29.684
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

40:29.760 --> 40:32.024
- Ms. Gaines, nice to see you again.
- And you.

40:36.667 --> 40:38.294
Mr. Vice President.

40:38.369 --> 40:41.031
- Thanks for coming out.
- Thank you for having me, sir.

41:05.429 --> 41:07.897
- Get him inside.
- All right.

41:07.965 --> 41:10.263
- Shit.
- Help! Help!

41:10.334 --> 41:11.824
This way.

41:26.350 --> 41:28.614
We have to get out of here.
Come on. Come on.

41:59.116 --> 42:01.175
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

42:02.720 --> 42:05.917
- Nicholas Brody.
- Richard Halsted. I'm-

42:05.990 --> 42:08.618
Secretary of Defense.
Believe me, I know who you are.

42:09.426 --> 42:11.155
What a fuckup.

42:30.447 --> 42:33.416
- Where's the vice president?
- Who knows?

42:33.484 --> 42:35.315
Where's the vice president?

42:35.386 --> 42:37.411
He's all right. Just right behind us.

42:39.056 --> 42:40.523
Goddamn it.

42:43.527 --> 42:44.687
Berenson.

42:44.762 --> 42:47.595
- It's me, Saul.
- <i>Uh, I-I gotta call you back.</i>

42:47.665 --> 42:49.997
- No!
- Carrie, we've got a situation.

42:50.067 --> 42:53.298
I-I know. I'm here.
Saul, you have to listen to me.

42:53.370 --> 42:55.600
- What do you mean you're here?
- <i>I saw the whole thing.</i>

42:55.673 --> 42:58.335
The woman that was hit,
Elizabeth Gaines- she is not the target.

42:59.510 --> 43:01.808
Vice president was the target.
Walker missed.

43:01.879 --> 43:05.110
Walker would not have missed once,
never mind three times!

43:05.182 --> 43:08.015
This is- This is just stage one.
The real attack has not come yet.

43:08.085 --> 43:10.019
What real attack?
What are you talking about?

43:10.087 --> 43:12.647
Following an assassination attempt,
they'll sequester the high-value targets.

43:12.723 --> 43:14.350
That's protocol.

43:14.425 --> 43:17.622
Right now, they're putting the vice
president and his team out of sight...

43:17.695 --> 43:19.356
in a single, small space.

43:19.430 --> 43:22.058
They're supposed to be safe there,
but they're not. They're vulnerable.

43:22.132 --> 43:24.862
- How?
- Brody.

43:24.935 --> 43:29.235
Brody?
For Christ's sake, Carrie. Not this again.

43:29.306 --> 43:32.139
Forget about before. This is now.

43:32.209 --> 43:35.178
<i>I saw him- Brody.</i>

43:35.245 --> 43:38.112
<i>They hustled him right through the metal</i>
<i>detectors along with the vice president.</i>

43:38.182 --> 43:39.911
- You even realize what you're saying?
- <i>Yes.</i>

43:39.984 --> 43:42.179
He's planning on taking them all out.

43:42.252 --> 43:44.186
That is what's coming!

43:44.254 --> 43:47.189
<i>We've been hearing chatter for days now-</i>

43:47.257 --> 43:50.658
<i>Marine One, Marine Two.</i>
<i>I- It's not the president's helicopter.</i>

43:50.728 --> 43:54.061
It's actual marines- Brody and Walker.

43:54.131 --> 43:55.860
They are Marine One and Marine Two.

43:55.933 --> 43:58.595
They're working together.
They must be. Saul, do you hear me?

43:58.669 --> 44:00.068
Yeah, I do.

44:00.137 --> 44:03.129
That's why Brody ratted me out-
'cause I was getting too close.

44:03.207 --> 44:07.701
- God, it finally all makes sense.
- Yeah, sure.

44:07.778 --> 44:09.769
Saul, you gotta get me in there.

44:11.415 --> 44:13.246
There's a C.T. Officer named Benton.

44:13.317 --> 44:15.842
- I-I know him.
- I'll send him out for you.

44:15.919 --> 44:17.887
Okay. Thanks. Hurry.

44:17.955 --> 44:19.855
Yeah. Bye.

44:19.923 --> 44:21.948
There's a woman outside
the building, one of ours.

44:22.026 --> 44:25.086
She's unstable,
and you need to contain her.

44:25.162 --> 44:27.096
Her name's Carrie Mathison.

44:38.142 --> 44:41.009
- I'm not getting stuck down here
for a day and a half.
- That won't happen, sir.

44:41.078 --> 44:42.773
I won't run and hide, you understand?

44:42.846 --> 44:45.406
- No one's asking that. Just a little caution.
- Get your hands off me.

44:45.482 --> 44:48.076
- My apologies.
- Fuck your caution.

44:48.152 --> 44:50.712
- One of my closest friends just got shot.
- All right. I understand.

44:56.093 --> 44:57.924
May I have your attention, please?

44:57.995 --> 45:01.624
We've initiated a full lockdown protocol
for your protection.

45:01.699 --> 45:03.929
That means this door will remain closed...

45:04.001 --> 45:06.060
until one of two things happens.

45:06.136 --> 45:08.229
The sniper's apprehended...

45:08.305 --> 45:11.797
We establish to our satisfaction
that he's left the vicinity...

45:11.875 --> 45:14.241
and it's safe to leave the room.

45:16.480 --> 45:19.847
- You fucking believe this?
- You're safe, sir. That's the priority.

45:19.917 --> 45:24.013
Safe from what?
We look like a bunch of idiots.

45:24.088 --> 45:28.081
Well, you're my advisers.

45:28.158 --> 45:30.991
How about some advice?
How about some fucking advice?

45:32.029 --> 45:34.520
How do we spin this?

45:34.598 --> 45:36.930
<i>There is nothing left to think about.</i>

45:37.000 --> 45:40.834
Clench your teeth. Say the holy words.

45:41.839 --> 45:43.329
<i>Remember Issa.</i>

45:47.244 --> 45:49.178
That's all we can do.

45:54.852 --> 45:57.412
I advise we wait, like the man said.

45:58.555 --> 46:01.319
Is there a men's room here?
There better be.

46:03.761 --> 46:05.490
Where is he? There's no time.

46:06.797 --> 46:08.662
- Wait.
- There he is.

46:08.732 --> 46:11.462
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I said wait.

46:11.535 --> 46:14.561
What's with all the backup?

46:19.309 --> 46:21.300
Damn you, Saul.

46:24.014 --> 46:26.005
- Virgil, am I crazy?
- Look, you know you are.

46:26.083 --> 46:28.074
No, I mean about Brody.

46:28.152 --> 46:30.712
Just tell me if I am.

46:30.788 --> 46:34.724
- Virgil, I need to know.
- I don't know, okay? But I trust you.

46:36.426 --> 46:38.656
- I need your keys.
- Where are you going?

46:38.729 --> 46:41.698
- You don't want to know.
- All right, go. I'll run interference.

46:41.765 --> 46:42.823
Benton!

46:45.903 --> 46:47.666
Hey, which one of you guys is Benton?

46:47.738 --> 46:50.605
Are you Benton?

46:50.674 --> 46:52.505
Which one of you is Benton?

47:16.266 --> 47:19.133
We're going to the hospital.
They'll know what's wrong with you.

47:28.979 --> 47:31.243
Any word out there?

47:32.583 --> 47:35.677
- No.
- Well, they said this could happen.

47:35.752 --> 47:37.413
You okay? You look a little peaked.

47:38.522 --> 47:40.888
Well, not a fan of
being locked up, I guess.

47:41.992 --> 47:43.983
You've reenergized him, you know.

47:45.929 --> 47:47.920
- Sir?
- Walden.

47:47.998 --> 47:52.492
He sees you as the living, breathing
vindication of everything he's ever done.

47:54.071 --> 47:56.471
He's got big plans for you.

47:57.741 --> 48:00.676
Wouldn't you know it? No paper towels.

48:00.744 --> 48:02.575
Another fuckup.

48:27.371 --> 48:29.100
Oh, come on.

48:56.633 --> 48:59.693
I'm coming!

48:59.770 --> 49:02.000
<i>No one is going in or out.</i>

49:02.072 --> 49:04.905
<i>Eyewitnesses say the vice</i>
<i>president and his supporters...</i>

49:04.975 --> 49:06.602
- <i>were almost inside the building-</i>
- My God.

49:06.677 --> 49:09.510
Oh, my God. Yeah? What?

49:14.418 --> 49:17.410
- What are you doing here?
- You're Dana, right?

49:17.487 --> 49:19.216
- Yeah.
- I'm Carrie Mathison.

49:19.289 --> 49:21.348
- I know who you are.
- It's about your dad.

49:22.826 --> 49:25.556
- Was he hit?
- No.

49:25.629 --> 49:27.756
- I saw on the TV that something-
- I know. I was there.

49:27.831 --> 49:30.095
I saw it happen. He wasn't shot.
But, Dana, I need your help.

49:30.167 --> 49:31.395
Can I come inside?

49:38.542 --> 49:40.601
- You heard about Tom Walker?
- Yeah.

49:40.677 --> 49:43.271
- How he was turned against us?
- Yeah.

49:43.347 --> 49:45.872
- Did he shoot those people?
- Yes.

49:47.117 --> 49:48.744
Dana, listen to me.

49:48.819 --> 49:52.220
Your dad told me that you are the one
who understands him, who he listens to.

49:54.424 --> 49:58.417
And this is very hard to say,
but your dad is working with Tom Walker.

49:58.495 --> 50:02.795
They're working together.
They are carrying out an attack right now.

50:02.866 --> 50:04.731
What are you talking about?

50:04.801 --> 50:06.962
He is with the vice president
and other innocent people.

50:07.037 --> 50:10.097
He is going to kill them
if we don't stop them.

50:12.042 --> 50:15.273
Okay. You have to call him
and just talk him down.

50:17.414 --> 50:19.712
All right?

50:19.783 --> 50:22.616
This will get you to the Secret Service.
That'll connect you.

50:26.256 --> 50:27.917
We don't have much time.

50:30.827 --> 50:32.988
You can do this, Dana.

50:38.435 --> 50:39.925
Okay.

50:44.975 --> 50:48.001
Hi. Um, I'm at 3319 Chapman,
and it's- it's an emergency.

50:48.078 --> 50:49.739
There's- There's an insane woman-

50:49.813 --> 50:52.145
No! No! Dana!

50:52.215 --> 50:54.445
- Get out!
- Dana, please. Get back inside!

50:54.518 --> 50:56.452
- Get out of my house!
- Dana, please, get back inside.

50:56.520 --> 50:58.488
- Get out! Please!
- Get back inside!

50:58.555 --> 51:00.489
- Get out of my house!
- Dana!

51:00.557 --> 51:02.286
- You must have noticed.
- Leave me alone!

51:02.359 --> 51:04.190
- Something strange, him acting off.
- No, you're off!

51:04.261 --> 51:07.196
- Just call him and make sure.
- Something is wrong with you!

51:07.264 --> 51:09.357
- God! Why are you even here?
- I told you!

51:09.433 --> 51:11.560
So we can stop him.

51:11.635 --> 51:15.162
- Who's that with Dana?
- Just stay in the car.

51:15.238 --> 51:18.571
- Leave me alone. Mom. Mom.
- What's going on?

51:18.642 --> 51:22.305
She came here and she says
that dad is working with Tom Walker!

51:22.379 --> 51:24.609
- Get in the house. Call the police right now.
- I already did.

51:24.681 --> 51:26.911
- Dana, please. Please call him.
- Get away from her!

51:26.983 --> 51:29.577
- Jessica, listen.
- What are you doing, telling
some crazy story to my daughter?

51:29.653 --> 51:32.144
No, it's not crazy.

51:34.291 --> 51:36.122
Tom Walker-

51:38.261 --> 51:40.195
He has intentions
to kill the vice president and his staff.

51:40.263 --> 51:42.060
- You have to believe me.
- Believe you?

51:42.132 --> 51:44.896
It's not too late to stop him.
I told Dana she needs to call him.

51:44.968 --> 51:47.960
- You fucked my husband.
- And now you need to call him.

51:48.038 --> 51:51.974
He tells you to get lost, and-and now
you're making up all this crazy shit.

51:52.042 --> 51:54.533
- You're not listening to me.
- Of course I'm not listening to you.

51:54.611 --> 51:56.909
Please, just call him.
You really don't want this happening.

51:56.980 --> 51:59.448
- Are we okay here?
- No, we're not okay.

51:59.516 --> 52:02.974
Okay, please. You don't understand
what's going on, any of you!

52:03.053 --> 52:07.080
- Ma'am-
- The world is about to end, and
we're standing around talking!

52:07.157 --> 52:09.819
- Ma'am, come with us.
- No! Get- Get off of me!

52:09.893 --> 52:11.884
- Come with us!
- Get off of me!

52:11.962 --> 52:14.430
Do not move!

52:14.498 --> 52:16.329
Stay down!

52:17.467 --> 52:20.493
Stay- Stay there.

52:53.803 --> 52:55.703
Ow! Shit.

53:20.063 --> 53:21.860
You okay in there?

53:23.900 --> 53:25.424
Yeah, fine.

53:25.502 --> 53:29.336
We found the shooter's weapon
abandoned in an apartment a block away.

53:29.406 --> 53:31.772
It shouldn't be too much longer,
we'll have you all out of there.

53:31.841 --> 53:32.899
Great.

53:40.383 --> 53:42.510
You sure you're okay?

53:42.586 --> 53:44.554
I'm feeling a little sick actually.

53:44.621 --> 53:46.953
- You need a doctor or anything?
- No. No.

53:47.023 --> 53:49.491
- That won't be necessary.
- All right.

54:24.427 --> 54:25.655
Sergeant Brody.

54:25.729 --> 54:28.664
I got a call for you from your daughter.

54:29.866 --> 54:32.664
She says it's an emergency.

54:33.470 --> 54:34.801
Go on.

54:35.739 --> 54:38.902
- Dana?
- Dad. Where are you?

54:38.975 --> 54:40.806
Dana, I gotta call you back.

54:40.877 --> 54:42.777
No, Dad, no. There was-

54:42.846 --> 54:45.542
There was this crazy woman
at our house, the one that-

54:45.615 --> 54:47.378
that, you know, you were with...

54:47.450 --> 54:51.216
and she was saying all these things about
you, and I just- I had to hear your voice.

54:54.090 --> 54:55.421
Dad?

55:01.698 --> 55:02.926
Dad?

55:05.168 --> 55:07.728
Yeah. Yeah, but, Dana, I-

55:07.804 --> 55:11.865
Dad, she said that you were working with
Tom Walker, that-that you're a terrorist.

55:14.678 --> 55:17.203
- I'm not.
- I know, Dad. I know. Of course you're not.

55:17.280 --> 55:20.579
I-I wouldn't have believed her, because
you would never do anything like that, ever.

55:20.650 --> 55:23.346
Ever. I didn't believe her at all.

55:24.921 --> 55:28.857
Dana, I'm here with a group of people.
Look, I've gotta go.

55:28.925 --> 55:31.416
No, Dad, don't.

55:31.494 --> 55:33.792
We're just, uh-
We're in a holding area, and, um...

55:33.863 --> 55:35.626
you know, they're about to let us out.

55:37.267 --> 55:38.928
So you're coming home?

55:39.002 --> 55:40.936
Sure.

55:41.971 --> 55:44.132
Tell me that.

55:46.242 --> 55:49.803
- Yeah, I'm coming home.
- <i>No, Dad, don't say it like that.</i>

55:49.879 --> 55:53.076
Dad, promise me.

55:54.317 --> 55:56.877
<i>You have to promise me</i>
<i>that you're coming home, Dad.</i>

56:02.225 --> 56:03.556
Dad?

56:06.029 --> 56:09.328
Dad, you have to promise me.

56:09.399 --> 56:11.731
I need you.

56:11.801 --> 56:13.962
You know that.

56:29.652 --> 56:31.813
I'm coming home, Dana.

56:34.858 --> 56:36.519
<i>I promise.</i>

56:41.064 --> 56:42.725
Okay.

56:42.799 --> 56:44.596
Thank you.

57:03.586 --> 57:05.144
Copy that.

57:05.221 --> 57:07.621
All right. We're clear.

57:08.992 --> 57:10.653
We're clear.

57:19.502 --> 57:22.665
Nick. You look like shit.

57:23.673 --> 57:26.005
Come on. What a fuckin' day.

57:44.594 --> 57:48.428
<i>Our thoughts and prayers</i>
<i>go out to her family...</i>

57:48.498 --> 57:50.489
<i>as does this pledge:</i>

57:51.768 --> 57:54.999
<i>Her murder will not go unpunished.</i>

57:56.806 --> 57:59.366
<i>For this reason...</i>

57:59.442 --> 58:02.343
<i>I stand before you today</i>
<i>to officially announce...</i>

58:02.412 --> 58:06.678
<i>my intention to run for president</i>
<i>of the United States...</i>

58:06.749 --> 58:08.876
<i>and to rededicate myself and this nation-</i>

58:08.952 --> 58:10.920
Yes, of course. Yes. Anytime.

58:10.987 --> 58:12.784
<i>To the fulfillment of the promise-</i>

58:12.856 --> 58:15.051
That was the police.

58:15.124 --> 58:17.615
They want to know
if we want to press charges.

58:17.694 --> 58:20.162
<i>...fear, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

58:20.230 --> 58:22.289
Brody, are you listening to me?

58:22.365 --> 58:25.596
- What did you tell them?
- That I would talk to you.

58:25.668 --> 58:28.694
I'll take care of it.

58:29.906 --> 58:31.396
This woman is sick.

58:31.474 --> 58:35.308
There's something
seriously wrong with this woman.

58:36.312 --> 58:39.748
So whatever you decide...

58:39.816 --> 58:42.307
I don't want to ever hear her name
in this house again.

58:42.385 --> 58:44.376
- I said I'll take care of it!
- Good.

58:47.590 --> 58:49.581
I'm gonna go see if Dana's doing better.

59:06.075 --> 59:07.440
Saul.

59:07.510 --> 59:09.444
Mr. Vice President.

59:12.582 --> 59:15.142
Give us, uh, five minutes?

59:15.218 --> 59:19.518
- Let's make it 10, be on the safe side.
- Ten.

59:19.589 --> 59:21.750
- How's Mira?
- Oh, great. Thanks.

59:49.485 --> 59:53.888
No doubt you and David Estes have
already huddled about this mess.

59:53.957 --> 59:55.618
What are you playing at, Saul?

59:55.692 --> 59:58.456
I call it "fuck the terrorists."

59:59.462 --> 01:00:01.453
Try to remember where you are, huh?

01:00:01.531 --> 01:00:04.125
I know exactly where I am, sir.

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.566
Are we on the same side?

01:00:06.636 --> 01:00:10.299
Because... your tone suggests otherwise.

01:00:11.574 --> 01:00:14.975
I'm trying to find out
what happened yesterday, why.

01:00:15.044 --> 01:00:17.069
I'm trying to stop it
from happening again.

01:00:17.146 --> 01:00:19.706
And you think this redacted file
will help you to do that?

01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:23.081
I can't know anything until I see
what's under all those black lines.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.683
Trust me, Saul.

01:00:25.755 --> 01:00:28.519
This is nothing but a turd. Let it lie.

01:00:32.895 --> 01:00:35.625
You were my boss
for three and a half years.

01:00:35.698 --> 01:00:38.428
Did I ever once let anything lie?

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:44.232
- I'm saying this would be a good time to start.
- I don't agree.

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:47.970
'Cause the other thing you
might remember about me-

01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:51.973
I'm a sentimentalist.

01:00:54.450 --> 01:00:57.044
I like to hold on to things...

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.849
for old time's sake.

01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:05.925
Whoever told the American people
these interrogation tapes had
been destroyed was mistaken.

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:11.423
Coercion, cruelty, outright torture.

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:13.867
Makes for very unhappy viewing.

01:01:14.871 --> 01:01:17.339
You gave the orders, William.

01:01:17.407 --> 01:01:19.102
You gave the orders.

01:01:20.743 --> 01:01:22.404
You're blackmailing me.

01:01:32.655 --> 01:01:36.091
And you'll stay with us.
The girls have fixed up a room for you.

01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:38.992
Little heavy on the flowers,
but they're very excited.

01:01:39.062 --> 01:01:40.552
Thank you, Maggie.

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:44.361
I told them that you'd need to rest,
but not, you know, why, exactly.

01:01:47.003 --> 01:01:49.494
Carrie?

01:01:51.841 --> 01:01:54.401
- Did you know he was here?
- No.

01:01:55.845 --> 01:01:57.642
Carrie, what are you doing?

01:01:57.714 --> 01:02:00.808
There are criminal charges pending.
You shouldn't talk to him.

01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:04.146
I have to.

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:13.821
Brody, I-

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:15.625
You broke into my house.

01:02:15.698 --> 01:02:20.158
You terrified my daughter.
She's 16 years old, by the way. Sixteen.

01:02:21.304 --> 01:02:22.794
I'm sorry.

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:27.541
They asked me what
I wanted to do about it- the police did.

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:32.806
- What did you tell them?
- Nothing yet.

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:35.846
It'll depend on you.

01:02:39.956 --> 01:02:42.322
For the last time, Carrie...

01:02:43.292 --> 01:02:45.453
I am not what you think I am.

01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:51.024
- I'm sorry.
- You keep saying that. It's not enough.

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:57.001
I know about your condition.

01:02:57.073 --> 01:02:58.665
David Estes told me.

01:03:00.977 --> 01:03:02.638
Carrie...

01:03:02.712 --> 01:03:05.476
you need to get some help.

01:03:05.548 --> 01:03:07.379
I am.

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:10.112
And you need to stay away from me...

01:03:10.186 --> 01:03:12.347
and from my family.

01:03:14.157 --> 01:03:16.250
You set up surveillance.

01:03:16.325 --> 01:03:18.054
You watched me.

01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:21.028
- You pushed your way into
my life, and for- for what?
- Okay.

01:03:21.097 --> 01:03:22.758
Fun?

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:26.795
It's crazy what you did.

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:28.530
- You understand that?
- I said okay.

01:03:28.604 --> 01:03:30.435
What does that mean?

01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:36.902
I-I understand.

01:03:39.248 --> 01:03:42.445
I'll stay away from you.
You have my word.

01:03:49.392 --> 01:03:51.257
Good-bye, Brody.

01:03:52.562 --> 01:03:54.052
Good-bye, Carrie.

01:04:26.062 --> 01:04:27.723
Home now?

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.590
The hospital.

01:04:39.809 --> 01:04:41.470
Oh, fuck.

01:04:44.013 --> 01:04:47.073
<i>Is Abu Nazir</i>
<i>in the target area or not?</i>
- <i>We believe so.</i>

01:04:47.149 --> 01:04:48.810
You sure you want to see this?

01:04:48.885 --> 01:04:51.786
What you've been hiding from me?
Yeah, I do.

01:04:51.854 --> 01:04:53.947
<i>We have 80% certainty on Nazir.</i>

01:04:54.023 --> 01:04:56.514
<i>A ground assault is preferable,</i>
<i>in terms of collateral damage.</i>

01:04:56.592 --> 01:04:58.583
<i>But impossible in the time frame.</i>

01:04:58.661 --> 01:05:02.188
- <i>That's a school, sir.</i>
- <i>Don't cloud the issue.</i>

01:05:02.265 --> 01:05:05.359
<i>If Abu Nazir is taking refuge</i>
<i>among children...</i>

01:05:05.434 --> 01:05:07.527
<i>he's putting them at risk, not us.</i>

01:05:09.338 --> 01:05:11.499
<i>So, we're agreed?</i>

01:05:22.418 --> 01:05:24.181
<i>Good to go.</i>

01:05:24.253 --> 01:05:27.154
<i>It's our joint opinion</i>
<i>the potential collateral damage...</i>

01:05:27.223 --> 01:05:29.555
<i>falls within current matrix parameters.</i>

01:05:29.625 --> 01:05:31.923
Good God.

01:05:31.994 --> 01:05:34.360
Somebody actually came up
with that language.

01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:51.776
That was two years ago.

01:05:51.847 --> 01:05:54.407
You reported to me at that time,
yet you said nothing.

01:05:54.483 --> 01:05:56.246
- Because you would have stopped it.
- Yeah.

01:05:56.319 --> 01:05:58.412
None of this would have happened.

01:05:58.487 --> 01:06:00.079
No dead children...

01:06:00.156 --> 01:06:02.920
no cover-up, no Carrie Mathison
drummed out of the Agency.

01:06:02.992 --> 01:06:04.482
Leave her out of this.

01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:11.362
You don't think
when she got a lead on Nazir-

01:06:11.434 --> 01:06:13.425
first one in over seven years-

01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:17.600
it wasn't worth mentioning
this drone strike?

01:06:17.673 --> 01:06:19.834
Even in private to me?

01:06:22.144 --> 01:06:26.774
Or does your career-
on the coattails of the vice president-

01:06:26.849 --> 01:06:28.874
trump national security?

01:06:30.553 --> 01:06:33.044
Really, I'm fascinated to know.

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:38.552
The world changed, Saul...

01:06:38.627 --> 01:06:40.288
right under your nose.

01:06:40.363 --> 01:06:42.456
Answer the damn question.

01:06:42.531 --> 01:06:46.968
I am. We're about projecting
American power now...

01:06:47.036 --> 01:06:48.970
degrading Al-Qaeda militarily.

01:06:49.038 --> 01:06:52.269
You want to play softball spy games,
go join the Germans or the French.

01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:55.970
I am this fucking close...

01:06:56.045 --> 01:06:58.275
to picking up the phone...

01:06:58.347 --> 01:07:00.975
and calling the <i>New York Times.</i>

01:07:03.486 --> 01:07:05.420
No, you're not.

01:07:07.123 --> 01:07:09.591
You know why?

01:07:09.658 --> 01:07:11.956
Because telling the world
we killed 82 kids on purpose...

01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:15.794
would endanger every one
of your case officers in the field...

01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:19.096
not to mention
every American soldier on the ground.

01:07:19.168 --> 01:07:21.398
You would essentially
be handing the enemy...

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:23.938
the biggest recruitment tool
since Abu Ghraib.

01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:50.550
Gotta say, I'm impressed
you had the balls to show up.

01:09:51.487 --> 01:09:53.546
I'm impressed you're alive.

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:56.420
Care to explain?

01:09:56.492 --> 01:09:58.722
We both got to the same place, Nick.

01:09:58.794 --> 01:10:00.455
I just got there a lot quicker.

01:10:00.529 --> 01:10:03.362
Now, you want to tell me
what happened yesterday?

01:10:03.432 --> 01:10:06.162
I don't answer to you, Tom,
and I didn't come here to make excuses.

01:10:06.235 --> 01:10:10.069
- What the fuck happened?
- I came here 'cause you got
a direct line to Nazir.

01:10:10.139 --> 01:10:12.903
- Fuck Nazir.
- My vest malfunctioned. Okay?

01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:14.670
Bullshit!

01:10:15.744 --> 01:10:17.405
You fuckin' panicked.

01:10:22.851 --> 01:10:24.341
Tom...

01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:28.322
maybe what happened yesterday
was a good thing.

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:31.188
What if I had detonated that vest?

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:35.219
What would be different?
Ask yourself that.

01:10:36.732 --> 01:10:39.724
Today, they'd have just replaced Walden
with somebody else.

01:10:39.802 --> 01:10:42.032
- So the fuck what?
- So?

01:10:42.104 --> 01:10:43.765
It means I'm close...

01:10:43.839 --> 01:10:46.774
to the next president
of the United States, Tom.

01:10:46.842 --> 01:10:49.333
That puts me in a unique position.

01:10:49.411 --> 01:10:51.504
Nazir?

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:54.310
You listening to this garbage, Nazir?

01:10:55.517 --> 01:10:58.042
<i>I am listening.</i>

01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:59.781
What do you want me to do?

01:10:59.855 --> 01:11:02.517
Put Nicholas on the phone.

01:11:13.636 --> 01:11:15.001
Nazir?

01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:17.231
Is it true what you say?

01:11:17.306 --> 01:11:20.969
Yes. I hit the switch,
but nothing happened.

01:11:21.043 --> 01:11:24.308
I meant about the vice president.

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:26.075
<i>Yes, it's true.</i>

01:11:26.148 --> 01:11:28.082
At the very least...

01:11:29.518 --> 01:11:32.954
I'd be able to influence policy
at the highest levels.

01:11:36.625 --> 01:11:39.924
Why kill a man when you can kill an idea?

01:11:42.264 --> 01:11:44.755
That's what I'm thinking.

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:51.129
Nazir, are you still there?

01:11:53.676 --> 01:11:56.167
I want to believe what you are saying.

01:11:56.245 --> 01:11:58.736
But to help me believe...

01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:03.243
I need a demonstration of your commitment.

01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:05.685
Name it.

01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:10.215
<i>You did it once-</i>
<i>or at least you thought you did.</i>

01:12:11.293 --> 01:12:14.023
There is a wild card in this new play.

01:12:15.464 --> 01:12:18.024
<i>Do you understand what I'm saying?</i>

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:19.624
<i>Nicholas?</i>

01:12:19.702 --> 01:12:21.363
Yeah, I understand.

01:12:23.272 --> 01:12:27.641
Then say good-bye, and tell Walker
I need to speak with him privately.

01:12:41.657 --> 01:12:43.591
He wants to talk to you.

01:13:07.316 --> 01:13:08.874
<i>It's done.</i>

01:13:54.196 --> 01:13:57.188
There were a million calls
while you were out.

01:13:57.266 --> 01:14:00.667
Press mostly,
but the vice president's office too.

01:14:11.713 --> 01:14:13.374
You okay?

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:20.449
Yeah, better.

01:14:22.357 --> 01:14:26.316
And, Jess, I'm sorry that
I was short with you before.

01:14:26.395 --> 01:14:28.488
It's okay.

01:14:28.564 --> 01:14:30.657
I'm surprised you're
keeping it together at all.

01:14:39.174 --> 01:14:41.199
Thank you.

01:14:41.276 --> 01:14:44.439
- For what?
- Everything.

01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:04.257
- Excuse me, sir. Excuse me, sir!
- Yeah, yeah.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:07.734
- I'm sorry, sir. This is a locked ward.
- I've got a pass.

01:15:07.803 --> 01:15:10.294
It's here somewhere.

01:15:10.372 --> 01:15:12.897
Looking for Pre-op.

01:15:12.975 --> 01:15:15.375
- It's across the hall, on the right.
- Where'd you say?

01:15:15.444 --> 01:15:18.106
- On the right, second door.
- Thank you.

01:15:23.819 --> 01:15:26.982
Just a little sting.
How you feeling, honey?

01:15:27.055 --> 01:15:28.545
Fine.

01:15:30.058 --> 01:15:31.889
- Take that thing out of her arm.
- Saul.

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.723
- Sir.
- Out of my way. It's fuckin' barbaric.

01:15:33.795 --> 01:15:35.285
- I won't allow it.
- Gerald!

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:37.059
- Saul, please.
- I'm getting you out of here right now.

01:15:37.132 --> 01:15:38.394
- Right now!
- Saul, stop.

01:15:38.467 --> 01:15:41.095
Just listen to me. This was-

01:15:41.169 --> 01:15:42.659
I want to do this thing.

01:15:42.738 --> 01:15:44.603
What?

01:15:44.673 --> 01:15:46.664
It was my decision.
I told them to go ahead.

01:15:46.742 --> 01:15:48.767
Your decision- to have shock treatment?

01:15:48.844 --> 01:15:50.607
It's not <i>Cuckoo's Nest,</i> Saul.

01:15:50.679 --> 01:15:53.807
They use ultra brief pulses now,
and it's called electroconvulsive therapy.

01:15:53.882 --> 01:15:58.114
I don't care what it's called. They still
attach electrodes to your skull, don't they?

01:15:58.186 --> 01:16:00.814
Still jolt you into a seizure?

01:16:00.889 --> 01:16:03.949
I need to do something.
I can't take this anymore.

01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:05.584
Yes, you can.

01:16:05.661 --> 01:16:07.822
You're the strongest person I know.

01:16:08.764 --> 01:16:10.664
This will pass.

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.862
No, it won't pass.

01:16:14.937 --> 01:16:17.098
It's only getting worse.

01:16:17.172 --> 01:16:20.664
Carrie, please, there's
alternatives to this.

01:16:20.742 --> 01:16:24.735
- You don't have to let 'em
fuck with your brain.
- My brain's already fucked.

01:16:24.813 --> 01:16:27.179
Yeah? It's a brain I happen to love.

01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:30.450
Is everything okay, Ms. Mathison?

01:16:30.519 --> 01:16:32.009
- Everything's fine.
- You sure?

01:16:32.087 --> 01:16:33.554
Thanks. Yeah, really.

01:16:41.597 --> 01:16:44.464
What about the side effects?
Memory loss.

01:16:45.701 --> 01:16:48.261
Well, it's only short-term.

01:16:48.337 --> 01:16:50.635
It's usually temporary.

01:16:52.641 --> 01:16:56.202
A lot of what's happened lately,
I'd kind of like to forget anyway.

01:16:56.278 --> 01:16:59.372
That's not even remotely funny.

01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:10.053
Saul, I've made up my mind.

01:17:10.125 --> 01:17:12.923
I'm grateful for the concern, but I just-

01:17:16.331 --> 01:17:20.062
I can't live like this anymore.
It needs to stop.

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:26.968
Yeah.

01:17:31.179 --> 01:17:33.113
Well-

01:17:35.717 --> 01:17:38.242
You shouldn't feel all bad.

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.914
I mean...

01:17:40.989 --> 01:17:43.924
it hasn't been an unmitigated disaster.

01:17:43.992 --> 01:17:46.483
You were wrong about Brody...

01:17:46.561 --> 01:17:48.552
but you were right about Nazir.

01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:52.293
Tell me. The-The yellow?
His period of dormancy?

01:17:52.367 --> 01:17:55.393
Yeah. He was in mourning.

01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:58.268
His son died in a drone strike,
northern Iraq.

01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:00.501
- Which son?
- Youngest.

01:18:00.575 --> 01:18:02.509
Ten years old.

01:18:02.577 --> 01:18:06.104
Along with 82 of his madrassa classmates.

01:18:06.181 --> 01:18:09.981
Apparently,
the vice president gave the order.

01:18:11.319 --> 01:18:13.787
How on earth did I miss that?

01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:15.482
You didn't.

01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:18.425
The record's been wiped clean...

01:18:18.493 --> 01:18:20.586
expunged...

01:18:20.662 --> 01:18:22.653
like it never happened.

01:18:24.399 --> 01:18:25.889
Wow.

01:18:31.973 --> 01:18:34.168
Thanks for telling me.

01:18:34.242 --> 01:18:36.335
You deserved to know.

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:48.478
Saul, do you think there's any chance
that I could appeal my termination?

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:50.821
No.

01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:18.079
Dad.

01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:24.726
What you doing up here?

01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:28.195
Came out to fix the leak in the skylight.

01:19:28.263 --> 01:19:31.061
With a beer?

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:33.101
That came later.

01:19:35.203 --> 01:19:37.262
I never knew we had views.

01:19:41.309 --> 01:19:43.300
The Schwartz backyard. Nice.

01:19:45.013 --> 01:19:46.708
Well-

01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:48.807
Do you mind if I join you?

01:19:48.884 --> 01:19:50.875
No, of course not.

01:20:21.116 --> 01:20:22.606
You ready?

01:20:30.458 --> 01:20:32.824
This is the anesthetic
I was telling you about.

01:20:32.894 --> 01:20:35.089
I want you to start
counting backwards from 100.

01:20:37.132 --> 01:20:39.600
100...

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:43.035
99, 98...

01:20:44.406 --> 01:20:47.000
97...

01:20:47.075 --> 01:20:49.805
96-

01:20:49.878 --> 01:20:51.539
<i>Ninety-five.</i>

01:21:15.403 --> 01:21:18.395
Issa.

01:21:21.776 --> 01:21:23.903
- Hey. You're with me.
- Issa, no!

01:21:23.979 --> 01:21:26.709
Issa.

01:21:26.781 --> 01:21:29.079
Issa. Issa.

01:21:29.150 --> 01:21:32.950
Nazir's son. Brody knew him.

01:21:33.021 --> 01:21:35.114
Don't let me forget.

01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:38.786
What did she say?

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:42.193
Nothing. It's the anesthetic.
Everyone does it.

01:21:47.636 --> 01:21:49.866
She's asleep.

01:22:00.682 --> 01:22:03.014
Okay, we're ready.

01:22:07.289 --> 01:22:09.553
Paddles on.

01:24:19.154 --> 01:24:20.143
