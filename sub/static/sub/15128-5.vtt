My daughter that you had
me believe was dead!

00:03.569 --> 00:04.968
Think on what you do.

00:04.970 --> 00:07.138
There is hell to be raised,
Fred, and I am to raise it.

work my daughter now follows.

00:12.949 --> 00:14.996
- Who am I?
- You are my daddy.

Ronald Capshaw named in the transaction

Aah!

03:46.843 --> 03:49.077
Teddy, I... I am sorry.

03:50.377 --> 03:52.988
Steady, Walter. Steady, brother.

03:53.991 --> 03:55.083
No, no.

03:55.673 --> 03:57.278
I'm sorry, Mr. B.

03:57.636 --> 04:00.436
Sorry you felt the urge
to test our promise to ya.

04:00.674 --> 04:03.036
Sorry you made us ask twice.

04:03.036 --> 04:05.954
Please, Teddy, it won't happen again.

04:05.955 --> 04:07.492
I know, Mr. B.

04:08.172 --> 04:09.287
I know.

04:11.893 --> 04:13.759
Away we go, my boys.

04:23.113 --> 04:24.409
Know this.

04:24.410 --> 04:27.677
Your good landlord
brings this violence down.

04:41.798 --> 04:44.376
Bet he sees his transgressions now.

04:44.541 --> 04:46.653
Do you not, Mr. Bartleby?

04:49.476 --> 04:50.764

You, ah... work today?

07:26.166 --> 07:29.439
No Mr. Reid, they must have need for you.

07:31.083 --> 07:33.053
Fill his boots.

07:34.027 --> 07:36.241
And I've told them before,

07:36.243 --> 07:38.553
they are heavy boots.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.720
Too heavy.

07:42.250 --> 07:45.281
And the boots of your friend also.

07:50.451 --> 07:52.870
I should go,

07:54.077 --> 07:56.144
Whilst it's still early, I mean.

08:05.808 --> 08:08.342
Time was you might have walked out of here

08:08.344 --> 08:10.716
No sort of comment on it.

08:12.215 --> 08:13.916
Time was.

08:15.790 --> 08:18.326
Time will be again, eh?

08:22.859 --> 08:25.730
Once we have declared the truth

08:25.862 --> 08:27.661
And must no longer hide ourselves.

08:28.931 --> 08:31.274
We have agreed, Bennet.

08:32.222 --> 08:34.284
It must be done right.

08:34.971 --> 08:37.938
For it to be right, Rose, it must be done.

08:40.017 --> 08:42.027
He's not your lookout.

08:42.511 --> 08:43.557
He is mine.

08:45.615 --> 08:49.467
Mr. Drake, open this door or
I shall put my foot through it!

08:53.545 --> 08:54.795
Half 7:00 of the morning

08:54.796 --> 08:57.172
and you not yet ready to meet the world.

09:06.301 --> 09:09.570
Consider this an apposite moment
to be getting your bones smunched,

09:09.572 --> 09:10.905
do you?

09:13.609 --> 09:15.910
My hours are my hours, Chief Inspector.

09:15.912 --> 09:17.882
And your duty?

09:20.283 --> 09:23.575
Inspector, a polite invitation.

09:24.045 --> 09:26.320
I have an address I would have you visit.

09:26.513 --> 09:28.391
My thanks, Chief Inspector.

09:28.751 --> 09:29.777
Perhaps another day.

09:30.341 --> 09:31.983
Now, Drake,

09:31.984 --> 09:34.930
Or I shall see Miss
Erskine's name in the news

09:34.931 --> 09:36.867
For altogether different reasons.

09:47.899 --> 09:49.572
I have knocked, I have shouted,

09:49.572 --> 09:50.443
But no reply.

09:50.443 --> 09:53.522
He's either elsewhere or he is insensible.

09:53.795 --> 09:56.293
My intuition leans to the latter.

09:56.294 --> 09:58.702
As does mine, miss.

10:07.351 --> 10:08.518
Oh, no.

10:09.120 --> 10:11.220
I do not care for whatever grief-struck

10:11.222 --> 10:13.155
rationale you will choose, but this...

10:14.525 --> 10:17.267
That is quite the most
revolting thing I have ever seen.

10:17.268 --> 10:18.793
Chief Dictator.

10:18.968 --> 10:21.286
Despite your great age,
you look fine to me.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.832
I pronounce you well.

10:27.738 --> 10:29.534
Be my guest.

10:34.245 --> 10:35.778
Aah!

10:35.780 --> 10:37.789
Aah! Aah!

10:39.551 --> 10:43.419
Ow! Ah! Ah!

10:50.848 --> 10:55.590
Another Miss Hart,
perhaps, er, by the window?

11:03.749 --> 11:05.654
It's better, I think...

11:06.255 --> 11:08.398
Yes, the light is forgiving.

11:11.990 --> 11:15.573
And, how, now you have come to understand

11:16.030 --> 11:19.324
the full extent of Mr.
Capshaw's wickedness,

11:19.325 --> 11:22.071
does it feel to know you had for so long

11:22.072 --> 11:24.283
harboured such a villain?

11:25.646 --> 11:27.628
I am wretched with it.

11:27.628 --> 11:28.684
But some succour is found,

11:28.685 --> 11:30.985
I hope, in the knowledge that the 55

11:31.619 --> 11:33.486
now have their justice.

11:33.488 --> 11:35.455
That he is dead, yes.

11:35.457 --> 11:37.882
The world is better for
the lack of that man.

11:39.294 --> 11:43.456
But that it necessitated
the loss of Mr. Reid...

11:43.457 --> 11:44.564
Loss, madam?

11:45.376 --> 11:47.075
His condition worsens?

11:47.588 --> 11:49.502
It is not improved.

11:50.768 --> 11:54.107
I can only thank God
I found him when I did.

11:54.888 --> 11:57.770
But we will care for
him, as long as we might.

12:00.659 --> 12:03.003
Mr. Reid is my friend.

12:03.510 --> 12:06.027
He and I have both fought or the same

12:06.343 --> 12:08.452
progress in this world of ours.

12:09.194 --> 12:13.137
Advancements which I remain set
on, which Obsidian remains set on.

12:13.570 --> 12:14.882
And nothing, Mr. Best,

12:14.883 --> 12:16.924
not the grievous wounding to the inspector,

12:16.950 --> 12:20.800
nor the terrible crimes we now understand
that gall Capshaw to have committed,

12:20.801 --> 12:22.350
shall deter us.

12:25.437 --> 12:26.610
Hmm.

12:27.908 --> 12:28.823
Just, uh,

12:28.824 --> 12:30.690
one more question, Miss Hart.

12:30.691 --> 12:32.611
- Of course.
- It is only this.

12:32.693 --> 12:35.102
The, uh, bearer bonds,

12:35.361 --> 12:38.211
The transaction of which
brought Mr. Reid to your door.

12:38.852 --> 12:40.153
What of them?

12:40.520 --> 12:41.566
Where are they?

12:44.333 --> 12:46.677
I only wish I knew, Mr. Best.

12:48.659 --> 12:50.615
That intelligence was
scattered to the winds,

12:50.616 --> 12:53.779
along with Mr. Capshaw's brains
and the inspector's buckshot.

12:56.483 --> 13:00.350
And still no soul to come
forward and say, "Mine.

13:00.754 --> 13:04.356
They were my securities
robbed from that locomotive."

13:07.528 --> 13:11.562
'Tis, um... a mystery.

13:12.728 --> 13:14.243
Is it not?

13:16.741 --> 13:18.304
Well, madam,

13:18.997 --> 13:23.439
I have no doubt that our readers
shall thrill, and lament, or course,

13:23.455 --> 13:26.049
to this exclusive witnessing you offer.

13:26.753 --> 13:29.569
For that I offer you my innumerable thanks.

13:30.394 --> 13:32.728
I am at their service Mr. Best.

13:34.811 --> 13:37.625
Dr. Frayn, a simple question for you.

13:37.626 --> 13:39.326
Yes, Chief Inspector?

13:39.726 --> 13:42.549
Is this man currently alive?

13:43.351 --> 13:44.712
He is not dead, sir.

13:45.114 --> 13:46.829
Then we have clarity.

13:46.830 --> 13:50.041
He's shot through the abdomen,
he's shot through the head

13:51.521 --> 13:53.575
He show's no sign of consciousness...

13:53.595 --> 13:56.557
It is why we have made not
attempt to move him elsewhere.

13:57.282 --> 13:59.563
We fight the sepsis in his side,

13:59.563 --> 14:01.542
the bullet impacted the skull...

14:01.542 --> 14:04.063
the swelling there will be intolerable.

14:04.064 --> 14:04.988
Dr. Frayn,

14:05.538 --> 14:06.570
Is he dead?

14:07.300 --> 14:09.336
He's not, sir.

14:09.739 --> 14:12.179
You, American.

14:12.259 --> 14:15.306
Repeat what she just now told us.

14:17.726 --> 14:19.293
He's not dead.

14:19.879 --> 14:21.527
Mr. Drake.

14:22.698 --> 14:25.804
Mr. Drake, you look at him.

14:28.813 --> 14:31.868
Repeat the doctor's prognosis.

14:32.174 --> 14:34.241
He is not dead.

14:34.243 --> 14:38.345
He... is not... dead.

14:38.347 --> 14:41.682
This man now lies here
because his sense of duty

14:41.684 --> 14:44.284
is greater than any other he holds.

14:44.378 --> 14:48.170
You, may argue the toss of such
wisdom, but the fact remains,

14:48.579 --> 14:52.355
Men, women, children, they need justice.

14:52.377 --> 14:54.758
And he sees to it that they get it.

14:55.639 --> 14:58.263
He dies, he does not die,

14:58.501 --> 15:00.593
that fact remains true.

15:01.752 --> 15:03.905
Meantime, Inspector Drake,

15:03.988 --> 15:07.979
You will do him the honour
of not debauching yourself

15:07.979 --> 15:09.493
While his streets burn.

15:09.525 --> 15:10.897
You, yankee.

15:10.897 --> 15:15.534
This man yet lives, but
there are others now dead

15:15.534 --> 15:17.636
awaiting us at Leman Street,

15:17.636 --> 15:20.735
I would have your renegade eyes upon!

15:22.085 --> 15:23.302
Doctor.

15:32.381 --> 15:35.871
Man made into 18 imperial gallons.

15:36.586 --> 15:38.252
Where was he found?

15:40.019 --> 15:41.085
Grace?

15:44.620 --> 15:47.587
That your name, is it? Grace?

15:47.587 --> 15:49.495
It is, Chief Inspector Abberline.

15:49.495 --> 15:51.400
Then answer your inspector.

15:51.400 --> 15:54.022
This barrel. Where was it found?

15:55.621 --> 15:57.956
Uh, Great Pearl Street, Chief Inspector.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.274
Street that had all
that rioting last night,

16:00.276 --> 16:04.081
Rioting our men might have
been out there preventing.

16:04.914 --> 16:08.297
No sign of where he was
from or who he might be?

16:08.298 --> 16:09.331
No, sir.

16:09.761 --> 16:11.288
I shall get myself to Great Pearl,

16:11.289 --> 16:14.135
therefore, see if this man is known there.

16:15.751 --> 16:17.115
_

16:37.898 --> 16:38.710
Lily.

17:14.193 --> 17:16.226
Found ya.

17:36.015 --> 17:38.035
Disturbing you, am I?

17:38.696 --> 17:39.828
Delivery,

17:40.068 --> 17:41.758
from the Black Eagle Brewery.

17:42.141 --> 17:43.140
Who for?

17:45.624 --> 17:47.324
Old Bartleby.

17:48.380 --> 17:50.444
The landlord?

17:52.431 --> 17:54.804
You'll be waiting a good old whiles.

17:56.469 --> 17:57.701
The man is dead.

17:58.937 --> 18:00.786
Dead? How?

18:00.973 --> 18:02.339
As yet to be determined.

18:02.794 --> 18:06.419
He was found jammed inside one of
them barrels out there, however.

18:09.448 --> 18:11.220
Did you know him?

18:11.584 --> 18:13.851
Uh, he took a porter from us.

18:13.853 --> 18:15.285
Our stout also.

18:16.391 --> 18:19.156
He kept his payments regular, did he?

18:19.158 --> 18:20.991
No debts, no trouble?

18:20.993 --> 18:23.336
Accounts. Not my department.

18:24.763 --> 18:25.762
You, miss.

18:28.701 --> 18:30.213
Did you know him?

18:30.798 --> 18:34.054
A wave hello, half a
glass off him, no more.

18:34.157 --> 18:35.973
You are the draper's girl,

18:35.975 --> 18:37.274
Are you not?

18:39.524 --> 18:41.476
Your shop front out there.

18:41.477 --> 18:43.981
All this violence passed through,

18:43.983 --> 18:45.983
Your premises exempted.

18:46.589 --> 18:48.392
What can I say?

18:48.393 --> 18:50.420
Pretty dresses, aren't they?

18:50.422 --> 18:54.091
Beauty is its own best form
of protection, they do say.

18:54.093 --> 18:55.459
Do they?

18:55.461 --> 18:56.660
Well, I do.

18:57.148 --> 18:59.623
Well, let's be about, then.

19:00.510 --> 19:01.832
Sir.

19:02.592 --> 19:03.986
Miss.

19:27.343 --> 19:29.209
Uncle Ben!

19:30.755 --> 19:32.519
Uncle Ben!

19:35.796 --> 19:37.678
Uncle Ben!

19:39.475 --> 19:40.759
Uncle Ben!

19:42.209 --> 19:43.234
Uncle Ben.

19:43.235 --> 19:44.735
Matilda.

19:44.737 --> 19:46.430
What are you...

19:46.705 --> 19:48.214
Mathilda!

19:48.541 --> 19:50.274
Mr. Drake, hello.

19:50.525 --> 19:51.468
Miss Cobden.

19:51.468 --> 19:52.367
Uncle Ben,

19:52.367 --> 19:54.385
we're going to visit my daddy.

19:54.385 --> 19:55.560
Will you come?

19:56.654 --> 19:59.226
Uh, no, Mathilda, I...

19:59.227 --> 20:00.258
Why not?

20:02.296 --> 20:04.337
I have visited already today,

20:04.771 --> 20:06.186
And is he well?

20:06.609 --> 20:08.471
No child, he is not.

20:08.521 --> 20:09.936
Please, Mathilda.

20:10.999 --> 20:14.099
And now we have found each
other, Mr. Drake, a word, perhaps?

20:14.100 --> 20:15.599
Yes.

20:15.968 --> 20:19.136
Mathilda, could you give
Mr. Drake and I a moment?

20:25.021 --> 20:28.255
Mr. Drake, I do not mean to be indelicate,

20:28.814 --> 20:30.650
But with her mother gone,

20:31.268 --> 20:33.464
Should we not, you and I, Edmund...

20:36.236 --> 20:38.549
Mr. Reid's friends, should we not

20:38.550 --> 20:40.717
discuss what would be
best for Mathilda now?

20:41.392 --> 20:43.161
Where, for example, will she live?

20:43.162 --> 20:44.312
Who will take care of her?

20:44.314 --> 20:47.978
Please, miss, I... he's not yet...

20:47.979 --> 20:49.027
Not dead?

20:49.924 --> 20:51.128
No, but...

20:55.343 --> 20:59.127
I do not think she will
want to remain with me.

21:01.199 --> 21:05.512
Inspector, you must agree it
is a conversation worth having.

21:05.593 --> 21:08.175
No, ye... I... yes.

21:08.475 --> 21:10.429
Of course.

21:16.877 --> 21:19.453
Uncle Ben, please,

21:19.509 --> 21:21.635
Do not be so sad.

21:21.922 --> 21:24.422
My daddy will recover.

21:24.763 --> 21:26.249
For do you really believe we will be

21:26.250 --> 21:30.261
returned to each other now,
only to be parted so swiftly?

21:32.499 --> 21:34.679
Come, Mathilda.

21:35.247 --> 21:37.952
Mr. Drake is about his business.

21:39.081 --> 21:40.138
Goodbye.

21:40.482 --> 21:42.240
Goodbye, Mathilda.

22:07.315 --> 22:08.089
Teddy.

22:08.090 --> 22:08.981
Walt.

22:10.018 --> 22:11.284
What you been about, Walter?

22:11.286 --> 22:12.919
Been about my work, Ted.

22:12.921 --> 22:14.763
I meant old Bartleby.

22:15.668 --> 22:16.703
Thought it'd please you.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.325
Really, brother?

22:18.325 --> 22:19.558
Please me?

22:19.560 --> 22:21.443
Who said you might kill Bartleby?

22:21.443 --> 22:23.421
It was not sanctioned, Walter.

22:23.422 --> 22:25.865
My brother or not, you
follow orders, my or...

22:36.057 --> 22:37.323
Look at you.

22:37.324 --> 22:39.088
You do see, Teddy.

22:39.816 --> 22:42.114
A time comes

22:42.758 --> 22:45.550
When your sanction is
neither here nor there.

22:47.228 --> 22:48.954
You're sick, Ted.

22:49.172 --> 22:51.323
Too sick to lead us.

22:53.190 --> 22:54.760
This here,

22:55.968 --> 22:58.213
All others, they must know

22:58.503 --> 23:01.649
The day has arrived. There is another

23:01.649 --> 23:03.972
they may look to for their directing.

23:03.973 --> 23:05.006
And what?

23:05.007 --> 23:07.549
You have to prove your steel, do ya?

23:07.806 --> 23:10.762
Show 'em what vengeance means, eh?

23:10.763 --> 23:13.816
But, Teddy, these publicans,

23:13.904 --> 23:17.909
They must know what will befall
them should they cross us.

23:18.118 --> 23:20.185
You of all, Teddy,

23:20.187 --> 23:22.888
You know what it is to be feared,

23:22.890 --> 23:25.732
What it is to take a life for our cause.

23:25.733 --> 23:27.908
Or do you forget what
you did at the feathers?

23:27.909 --> 23:28.660
No.

23:29.441 --> 23:31.530
Not while I'm awake.

23:31.532 --> 23:33.032
Not while I'm dead, neither.

23:33.906 --> 23:35.588
Never again, do you hear?

23:35.589 --> 23:38.334
You leave that boy alone now! Let him be!

23:41.470 --> 23:43.404
All right, lad, all right.

23:43.405 --> 23:44.899
You're with me now.

23:44.900 --> 23:46.333
Thank you, sir.

23:46.647 --> 23:48.046
What is your name?

23:48.048 --> 23:49.748
It is Walter...

23:49.750 --> 23:51.455
Ah... Shipman.

23:51.455 --> 23:53.578
Walter, you come with me. We set you right.

23:53.713 --> 23:56.752
Ah, there's no need for
that. I should head home.

23:58.867 --> 24:00.416
Get myself clean and bound there...

24:00.417 --> 24:05.013
No Walter, my orders... you must
make complaint, we must hear it.

24:06.915 --> 24:08.612
And boots blue.

24:09.077 --> 24:11.222
Two, you say, Mr. Shipman?

24:13.060 --> 24:15.694
As I saw, two.

24:18.517 --> 24:20.032
Yes, Walter?

24:20.034 --> 24:21.602
They thieved from ya.

24:21.802 --> 24:23.402
Never had the chance.

24:23.465 --> 24:26.104
You came upon them too sudden, Constable.

24:26.439 --> 24:29.622
They set about him with
a cooper's froe, Sergeant.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.410
Known to you already?

24:31.935 --> 24:34.053
Never laid an eye on none of 'em.

24:34.310 --> 24:37.066
It did not seem that way to me, Walter.

24:37.091 --> 24:39.304
Seemed to me you knew them all well.

24:39.654 --> 24:44.304
On Jesus Christ himself, I did not
know them from a hole in the ground.

24:45.513 --> 24:48.336
These from the beating you
just now took, are they?

24:48.336 --> 24:49.489
They must be,

24:49.490 --> 24:50.636
sir, yes.

24:50.638 --> 24:52.471
They look older to me, Walter.

24:52.779 --> 24:54.704
Day or so.

24:54.705 --> 24:57.330
These here, older still.

24:59.205 --> 25:01.105
The brawls and riots last night.

25:01.107 --> 25:03.007
They come your way?

25:03.009 --> 25:05.743
Or did you go theirs, Walter?

25:05.745 --> 25:08.562
Whole quarter was a carve-up, Constable,

25:08.781 --> 25:11.464
and a fellow must protect hisself,

25:11.774 --> 25:15.719
Particularly when you and
yours are nowhere to be seen.

25:17.188 --> 25:18.246
Now, then,

25:18.246 --> 25:20.630
that bandaging is good and secure.

25:20.630 --> 25:22.825
Put a field nurse to shame, it would.

25:23.863 --> 25:25.463
Would there be ought else, sir,

25:26.168 --> 25:28.738
or am I to be arrested for my own battery?

25:44.517 --> 25:46.917
Shipman, Shipman...

25:46.919 --> 25:48.586
Shipman.

26:00.882 --> 26:03.449
His name is Bartleby,

26:03.451 --> 26:06.352
Landlord up at The Lamb and Kidney.

26:07.671 --> 26:09.467
Yeah?

26:10.634 --> 26:12.335
Lamb and Kidney, huh?

26:14.198 --> 26:16.386
I might have save you the trip.

26:16.955 --> 26:20.293
A man believes he's seen every
barbarism he might imagine...

26:20.293 --> 26:24.450
but Whitechapel, it will ever astound.

26:26.070 --> 26:27.772
He was dead before he went in.

26:29.733 --> 26:31.846
Save for the breaking of his joints,

26:31.847 --> 26:34.207
there's no abrasions, not
a scratch, not a splinter.

26:34.208 --> 26:36.326
Whatever force was applied
before he went inside,

26:36.326 --> 26:39.615
he, uh... went in without resistance.

26:40.160 --> 26:41.834
And so?

26:42.353 --> 26:44.295
The cause of death?

26:45.457 --> 26:48.251
Time, Hightower.

26:48.726 --> 26:50.359
Time.

27:25.428 --> 27:27.790
Do you forget, Mr. Grimes,

27:27.791 --> 27:31.613
That the men of the Black Eagle
are not to be crossed?

27:40.218 --> 27:41.442
Chief Inspector...

27:43.311 --> 27:44.992
Mr. Reid,

27:45.349 --> 27:46.995
would stay in there,

27:47.033 --> 27:50.863
whilst such work was performed?

27:52.046 --> 27:54.681
He has a stomach for such things, sir.

27:55.156 --> 27:57.620
Past tense, Inspector,

27:58.006 --> 27:59.779
you be careful.

28:06.371 --> 28:07.533
Coffee.

28:09.253 --> 28:11.442
Thanks Drake.

28:12.234 --> 28:14.846
What is that, his lungs?

28:15.046 --> 28:16.635
Yeah.

28:16.999 --> 28:20.367
Good deal steelier than you used to be.

28:20.939 --> 28:23.251
Don't think I haven't noticed.

28:25.570 --> 28:27.989
And they are cut out for why?

28:28.062 --> 28:31.057
Well, by my reckoning, I'd say...

28:31.242 --> 28:32.641
This man was drowned.

28:33.257 --> 28:34.799
Reckoning?

28:34.879 --> 28:37.010
Was he or was he not?

28:39.329 --> 28:41.742
Chief Inspector Abberline!

28:44.555 --> 28:47.056
And so?

28:49.892 --> 28:51.271
You see this here?

28:52.217 --> 28:54.751
Now, the French have a name for that.

28:54.853 --> 28:57.217
Champignon de mousse.

28:57.218 --> 29:00.091
And why should I care what the
bloody French call anything?

29:00.092 --> 29:02.679
Well, a man is never too
old to learn something.

29:02.942 --> 29:06.399
Man's never too old to put his
boot up an American's arsehole.

29:09.223 --> 29:11.312
Now, as drowning occurs,

29:11.412 --> 29:13.894
the, uh, the... the
blood cells in the lungs,

29:13.895 --> 29:16.056
they break down, and a foam is forced

29:16.056 --> 29:18.804
all the way up through the air passage.

29:18.804 --> 29:22.142
Now, this residue, that's what remains.

29:29.935 --> 29:31.456
You hear that?

29:31.842 --> 29:32.841
Mmm.

29:32.880 --> 29:35.075
That's crepitation.

29:35.792 --> 29:38.959
That there is the sound
of air against liquid.

29:40.059 --> 29:42.508
But he's not sodden.

29:42.508 --> 29:44.967
His body shows no signs of being in water.

29:44.967 --> 29:46.044
This is true, Inspector,

29:46.044 --> 29:48.445
and yet the man is drowned.

29:49.131 --> 29:51.398
Mr. Abberline, any thoughts?

29:51.400 --> 29:53.601
He is held down

29:53.603 --> 29:55.970
and it is poured into him.

29:55.972 --> 29:59.440
He is choked by whatever liquid was used.

30:03.247 --> 30:04.580
And the liquid.

30:04.581 --> 30:05.680
What was it?

30:10.620 --> 30:12.286
Take a sniff.

30:16.559 --> 30:17.725
It is beer.

30:24.515 --> 30:26.931
Think to take advantage, do you?

30:27.271 --> 30:29.224
Well, we will not suffer it.

30:29.321 --> 30:30.817
Do you understand?

30:32.971 --> 30:34.070
No, sir.

30:34.178 --> 30:35.956
Not no longer.

30:36.293 --> 30:38.160
No second chances.

30:38.162 --> 30:40.036
No indulgence.

30:41.098 --> 30:43.398
I'm gonna make an example of you, sir.

31:58.874 --> 32:00.983
Day's work made ya thirty, huh?

32:03.607 --> 32:04.719
Risky devil.

32:12.013 --> 32:13.169
Leave the bottle.

32:24.399 --> 32:25.891
Forgive me, Drake.

32:25.892 --> 32:27.433
Oh, here we go.

32:27.435 --> 32:29.502
I, um... I get the sense

32:29.504 --> 32:32.840
that your current temper does not arise

32:32.842 --> 32:35.690
solely from the prone
state of our fallen comrade.

32:35.690 --> 32:39.475
Point in fact, and I
know it disgruntles you,

32:40.978 --> 32:43.780
but I've seen that face before.

32:47.837 --> 32:52.106
Queen of the Costers has you
by your coconuts once more.

32:52.107 --> 32:53.463
Am I right?

32:56.482 --> 32:58.062
Listen, I'm not one to judge,

32:58.063 --> 33:00.644
and I'm not saying this because
I have the manhood loyalty.

33:00.645 --> 33:04.851
I say this on account of the fact that
I've seen you banjaxed by that lady

33:04.851 --> 33:06.756
more than once in your life.

33:07.753 --> 33:12.196
But, lest you forget,
Rose is promised Drake.

33:18.566 --> 33:22.204
Never understood the fuss myself.

33:23.860 --> 33:25.278
Beer.

33:26.617 --> 33:28.884
May as well drink from the river.

33:29.399 --> 33:32.529
Warm, flat.

33:35.596 --> 33:39.231
Useful qualities, however,

33:39.232 --> 33:41.563
when a man wishes to drink of it

33:41.632 --> 33:43.406
in great volume.

33:53.173 --> 33:54.372
Now, Drake.

33:54.766 --> 33:56.220
Listen.

33:56.661 --> 34:00.322
We come to take in a show,

34:00.624 --> 34:03.518
Not perform in one
ourselves. You understand?

34:04.060 --> 34:06.864
Do not worry about me, Captain.

34:17.664 --> 34:18.899
You!

34:19.331 --> 34:21.199
That's you.

34:25.502 --> 34:26.501
Darlin'.

34:28.308 --> 34:29.774
You forgive me, don't you?

34:30.003 --> 34:30.842
For the pig?

34:31.138 --> 34:32.168
Unlikely.

34:32.319 --> 34:34.090
If you are to take
anything else to your bed,

34:34.091 --> 34:36.170
do try to make sure it has a pulse first.

34:36.248 --> 34:37.371
Now, why are you here?

34:37.371 --> 34:39.313
Uh, well, I've come...

34:43.628 --> 34:45.341
Shit.

35:02.382 --> 35:03.815
Excuse me.

35:04.411 --> 35:08.379
I want you to speak to him tonight.

35:08.381 --> 35:10.646
No, Bennet. I told you,
I shall choose the time.

35:10.646 --> 35:12.383
Where, Rose? How?

35:12.385 --> 35:13.978
Not like this.

35:14.287 --> 35:15.577
I'm sorry, Rose, but...

35:16.770 --> 35:19.278
Is there a past between the two of them?

35:20.894 --> 35:22.156
Oh, shit.

35:22.666 --> 35:24.266
"Past" is one word.

35:24.299 --> 35:26.611
And you bring him here,
the two of you in your cups?

35:26.612 --> 35:28.386
This is my brother's whore.
She's my brother's fiancée.

35:28.387 --> 35:30.799
Hey, we're all adults, here,
okay? We go our own way.

35:30.800 --> 35:32.172
Oh, do we, now?

35:32.173 --> 35:34.448
You do something, you do it now.

35:34.449 --> 35:38.020
I fear for us. I fear we
shall lose each other again.

35:38.723 --> 35:40.173
Hello.

35:40.174 --> 35:41.499
- Hi.
- That was so wonderful.

35:41.500 --> 35:43.466
- Oh, thank you.
- You were marvellous.

35:43.748 --> 35:45.481
Oh!

35:45.802 --> 35:47.904
Oh, thank you so much.

35:48.855 --> 35:50.533
Shit.

35:56.075 --> 35:57.328
Mr. Morton.

35:59.050 --> 36:00.365
Inspector.

36:02.131 --> 36:03.875
I, uh...

36:05.251 --> 36:07.876
We're leaving now, brother.

36:43.591 --> 36:45.054
Here, Inspector.

36:51.636 --> 36:53.035
Thank you, Doctor.

37:01.099 --> 37:02.327
Ma'am,

37:02.498 --> 37:04.287
excuse me,

37:06.051 --> 37:09.718
do you believe him, in pain?

37:11.094 --> 37:13.204
I can not say, Inspector.

37:14.585 --> 37:18.209
But, whatever Mr. Abberline might say,

37:20.096 --> 37:23.775
he will die, will he not?

37:28.652 --> 37:31.431
Papers! Get your papers here!

37:31.683 --> 37:33.267
Morning papers!

37:34.177 --> 37:35.985
Obsidian double shooting!

37:35.986 --> 37:37.786
Miss Hart speaks out!

37:37.787 --> 37:39.599
Morning papers!

37:40.890 --> 37:42.357
I'll have one of those.

37:43.378 --> 37:45.213
Morning papers!

37:45.846 --> 37:48.629
Truth behind the Obsidian shooting!

37:48.631 --> 37:50.738
Miss Hart speaks out!

37:51.919 --> 37:54.073
Morning papers!

37:56.339 --> 37:58.765
Morning papers!

38:00.209 --> 38:03.386
His name was Grimes, we are told.

38:03.479 --> 38:06.814
Landlord at the Hogshead,
on Old Queen Street.

38:06.816 --> 38:09.650
Mister Ward of Peace on the Streets,

38:09.652 --> 38:11.986
One more dead publican!

38:11.988 --> 38:14.288
Contusions to his nose
to force his mouth open,

38:14.290 --> 38:16.093
The teeth are chipped where the vessel

38:16.094 --> 38:17.912
was forced into his
mouth, and we got the same

38:17.913 --> 38:20.594
residual foaming around the nose and lips.

38:20.596 --> 38:24.298
Same murdering, same
profession, same presentation.

38:24.300 --> 38:26.605
- If you please, Chief Inspector...
- What, boy?

38:26.605 --> 38:28.664
Might I be excused but two minutes only?

38:28.664 --> 38:29.854
Excused? What?

38:30.235 --> 38:32.763
To tend to your toilet, duchess?

38:32.922 --> 38:35.934
No, sir, but it is material
to what we now discuss.

38:35.935 --> 38:37.629
Material, is it?

38:37.980 --> 38:39.449
Just go.

39:01.304 --> 39:02.764
Now,

39:03.380 --> 39:04.946
will you share what it is

39:04.947 --> 39:07.659
you consider to be quite so material

39:07.660 --> 39:09.760
that we here have to
wait upon your pleasure

39:09.761 --> 39:13.002
as if you are the emissary of
the ottoman emperor himself?

39:13.558 --> 39:16.553
Uh, yes, Chief Inspector.

39:16.985 --> 39:19.262
A lad I found yesterday, down a laneway

39:19.263 --> 39:20.888
off the back of Corbett's Court,

39:20.890 --> 39:22.823
set upon by two others.

39:22.825 --> 39:24.742
I brought him here to make complaint,

39:24.796 --> 39:26.162
patched him up.

39:26.933 --> 39:30.481
But there was something...
he was gobby, sir.

39:30.590 --> 39:32.796
And did you arrest him for
having a big mouth, then?

39:33.121 --> 39:34.725
I did not.

39:34.904 --> 39:37.021
I went looking for him, however.

39:37.173 --> 39:38.973
- And found?
- No record of him.

39:38.975 --> 39:41.709
I did find the lad's brother, however.

39:41.711 --> 39:43.177
He is here represented.

39:47.504 --> 39:50.104
Edward Shipman, assorted counts of affray,

39:50.105 --> 39:53.191
known kin a brother,
Walter, younger by six years,

39:53.256 --> 39:55.253
no other family, orphans.

39:55.254 --> 39:56.724
Walter is the lad you brought here, yes?

39:56.726 --> 39:57.853
Just see below, Mr. Drake.

39:57.853 --> 40:00.861
Yes, Mr. Drake, see below.

40:00.863 --> 40:03.130
Charge of murder three years past,

40:03.132 --> 40:04.598
a Mr. Daniel Parker.

40:04.600 --> 40:06.467
See his profession, Inspector.

40:06.469 --> 40:07.952
Publican.

40:08.377 --> 40:10.210
The Feathers on Underwood Street.

40:10.211 --> 40:11.741
The place burnt to the ground.

40:11.741 --> 40:14.675
Mr. Parker found alone
within, burnt to a char,

40:14.677 --> 40:16.984
but his bones and body still showing signs

40:16.985 --> 40:18.824
of the attack he suffered.

40:18.824 --> 40:20.447
Leg broke with a blunt instrument,

40:20.449 --> 40:21.701
most like made of steel.

40:21.702 --> 40:23.513
The attack he suffered when I found him

40:23.602 --> 40:25.953
was set about by a cooper's froe.

40:25.955 --> 40:27.054
I wonder

40:27.056 --> 40:29.056
if it was this older brother, Edward,

40:29.058 --> 40:31.392
who led the attack on
Walter in the laneway.

40:31.394 --> 40:33.125
Let me see that file.

40:42.538 --> 40:46.258
You ever seen a cooper's
froe at work, ever?

40:46.446 --> 40:49.176
It's a wooden handle, t-shaped blade.

40:49.178 --> 40:51.048
It's used for the splitting of wood.

40:51.049 --> 40:53.146
Man smashes it in with his fist

40:53.147 --> 40:55.748
and the blade is used
to waggle the split free.

40:58.075 --> 40:58.931
These limbs here,

40:58.932 --> 41:01.127
they're all broken at the joints.

41:01.127 --> 41:03.279
The sockets are popped, the sinews spliced,

41:03.280 --> 41:05.649
but not a mark on their skin.

41:05.650 --> 41:08.177
It's the same thing with
this man Grimes also,

41:08.177 --> 41:10.397
both of these men cosied into their housing

41:10.399 --> 41:12.704
with nary a scratch on 'em.

41:14.107 --> 41:15.645
The barrels are built around 'em.

41:15.646 --> 41:17.293
They're drowned in their beer,

41:17.293 --> 41:20.412
their bodies are broken down
to the exact size, and...

41:21.242 --> 41:23.991
and they're coopered into a firkin.

41:24.639 --> 41:27.815
It is skilled work by skilled workmen.

41:27.817 --> 41:29.477
See, Inspector Drake,

41:29.477 --> 41:32.119
Edward Shipman was
apprenticed to the coopers

41:32.121 --> 41:34.188
at the Black Eagle Brewery at 16.

41:34.190 --> 41:35.418
He's worked there ever since.

41:35.418 --> 41:38.258
And the charge against
him? What became of that?

41:38.508 --> 41:40.127
Alibi came forward.

41:40.129 --> 41:42.896
Miss Lily Timson, apprentice to a draper.

41:42.898 --> 41:44.465
Lily Timson.

41:44.467 --> 41:45.925
I met this girl.

41:45.989 --> 41:47.255
I've seen her shop.

41:47.256 --> 41:48.555
It is on Great Pearl Street.

41:48.556 --> 41:51.543
As does The Lamb and Kidney,
Mr. Bartleby here's house.

41:51.544 --> 41:52.743
Streets through which

41:52.744 --> 41:55.522
that unpoliced riot swept two nights past.

41:55.523 --> 41:58.316
And hers the only windows not smashed in.

41:59.096 --> 42:00.596
You, duchess,

42:00.597 --> 42:01.491
find a man.

42:01.492 --> 42:02.981
Send him to Queen Anne Street

42:02.981 --> 42:04.822
to see about the publican Grimes.

42:04.823 --> 42:07.390
All and everything to tell
about his life and work,

42:07.391 --> 42:09.558
have it returned to us here.

42:09.559 --> 42:12.961
You, meanwhile, shall go fetch Miss Timson,

42:12.962 --> 42:15.745
She who finds herself
immune to insurrection.

42:15.799 --> 42:17.475
Yes, Chief Inspector.

42:17.552 --> 42:20.018
Mr. Drake, you and I shall take a trip

42:20.018 --> 42:21.739
to the Black Eagle Brewery

42:21.739 --> 42:23.804
and have a word with Mr. Shipman.

42:23.806 --> 42:24.876
Yes, sir.

42:24.876 --> 42:27.441
You, Captain fancy-pants.

42:27.443 --> 42:29.782
The brew poured down these men.

42:29.782 --> 42:32.246
You have the means to find its nature?

42:32.248 --> 42:34.265
Now, you ask me that
way, I've got the means

42:34.266 --> 42:36.404
to find out about anything you want.

42:39.156 --> 42:41.982
What you ask, gentlemen,
is no simple thing.

42:42.124 --> 42:45.023
One apprentice to be
remembered among so many?

42:45.285 --> 42:47.977
You see here, this cathedral?

42:48.230 --> 42:49.817
Some say the Black Eagle might be

42:49.818 --> 42:52.011
the biggest brew house in the world.

42:53.936 --> 42:58.400
Millers, malters, mashers, lauterers,

42:58.495 --> 43:01.810
Lads to watch the boil,
lads to watch the filtering,

43:02.144 --> 43:04.167
And lads for the coopery.

43:04.168 --> 43:05.946
Many, many hundreds of lads.

43:09.401 --> 43:13.018
And I'm asked to remember one
off the top of my dear old head?

43:13.019 --> 43:14.850
There are records, however.

43:15.277 --> 43:16.961
You keep note of who is apprenticed,

43:16.963 --> 43:17.980
Who is employed?

43:17.981 --> 43:20.303
Well, we must do somewhere.

43:20.987 --> 43:23.696
Fortunate for you,
however, I do know the lad.

43:23.697 --> 43:24.498
Oh.

43:24.500 --> 43:26.371
The lad is known.

43:26.372 --> 43:27.935
This way, gentlemen.

43:31.589 --> 43:33.675
He's not been well these past few months,

43:33.762 --> 43:35.974
So I brung him in here to work with me.

43:36.045 --> 43:37.782
Through here, gents.

43:46.889 --> 43:48.446
Well.

43:49.425 --> 43:51.229
Always a pleasure to put a name to a face,

43:51.555 --> 43:52.721
Eh, Mr. Shipman?

43:53.479 --> 43:55.496
You pack up your work
and get your coat, boy.

43:57.141 --> 44:00.389
Mr. Drake, make his arrest.

44:01.103 --> 44:02.703
Suspicion of murder.

44:10.818 --> 44:12.785
Daniel Parker.

44:12.786 --> 44:14.881
This is raked over again, is it?

44:14.924 --> 44:16.867
Aye, son, it is.

44:17.342 --> 44:18.419
I was nowhere near.

44:18.420 --> 44:19.547
It was proved.

44:19.548 --> 44:21.151
It was lied.

44:22.588 --> 44:25.189
A man like you, a gruff copper.

44:25.190 --> 44:27.465
He took my irons off and set me free.

44:28.056 --> 44:29.755
I was innocent of that,

44:30.471 --> 44:31.908
As I surely am for whatever it is

44:31.909 --> 44:33.660
you now think to accuse of me.

44:33.758 --> 44:36.252
Frederick Grimes, of the Hogshead.

44:36.477 --> 44:37.755
Do you recall him?

44:37.755 --> 44:38.811
I do not.

44:38.813 --> 44:40.346
He's a stranger to me, sir.

44:41.876 --> 44:43.489
John Bartleby.

44:44.216 --> 44:45.684
You knew him, however.

44:45.686 --> 44:46.685
I did.

44:47.026 --> 44:48.554
I met you, sir,

44:48.556 --> 44:50.245
Inside his smashed-up pub.

44:50.314 --> 44:53.147
Was it you who smashed it, Mr. Shipman?

44:53.148 --> 44:53.910
It was not.

44:53.911 --> 44:56.415
Was it your brother Walter smashed it?

44:56.416 --> 44:58.019
I'm not my brother.

44:58.068 --> 44:59.322
I cannot speak for him.

44:59.323 --> 45:00.678
You were seen, however,

45:00.679 --> 45:03.059
giving him a right belting just yesterday.

45:04.172 --> 45:06.462
Brothers do fight, Inspector.

45:12.651 --> 45:15.966
You were trained as a
cooper, however, Mr. Shipman?

45:16.381 --> 45:17.387
I was.

45:17.389 --> 45:21.035
Could you put a man in a
barrel, should you wish it,

45:21.357 --> 45:23.097
without a single scrape on him?

45:23.098 --> 45:25.758
That would be a task, and no mistake,

45:25.759 --> 45:27.183
I would not know where to begin.

45:27.184 --> 45:28.672
In my life,

45:28.947 --> 45:32.198
how many questions have I
asked of how many young fellows

45:32.199 --> 45:33.403
Like you?

45:34.324 --> 45:37.507
Of that I must also declare
myself ignorant, sir.

45:37.509 --> 45:39.609
Then I shall tell you.

45:39.611 --> 45:43.311
Sufficient to know when I am lied to.

45:45.216 --> 45:46.917
No! Sir.

46:03.499 --> 46:04.420
You, man.

46:04.421 --> 46:05.795
Bring me the American now.

46:17.916 --> 46:19.722
Well, remove his irons, will you?

46:40.193 --> 46:41.236
How long

46:41.237 --> 46:43.706
have you been living
with consumption, Teddy?

46:43.708 --> 46:46.442
Six months. Perhaps seven.

46:46.444 --> 46:48.611
Have you not had it treated?

46:48.613 --> 46:49.612
Men have tried.

46:52.817 --> 46:55.394
I'm not far off now, am I, sir?

46:56.654 --> 46:58.888
No, you're not.

46:58.890 --> 47:01.157
And unlikely to find the required strength

47:01.159 --> 47:03.092
to see those men beaten and broken

47:03.094 --> 47:04.789
and housed in their firkins.

47:08.374 --> 47:10.642
Your brother, however.

47:10.643 --> 47:11.923
He has the same training,

47:11.924 --> 47:13.781
training that might put a man in a barrel.

47:13.782 --> 47:15.238
Is that why you beat him?

47:15.239 --> 47:16.521
Has he put his training to work?

47:16.522 --> 47:18.546
How many times must I say it?

47:20.289 --> 47:21.755
He's of age.

47:23.081 --> 47:25.058
I'm not my brother's keeper.

47:27.486 --> 47:29.272
Give us a minute, will you?

47:49.653 --> 47:52.321
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

48:00.711 --> 48:02.903
I have an older brother, you know.

48:03.019 --> 48:05.047
And how is he?

48:05.620 --> 48:10.122
You spend a good deal of
time looking up for example,

48:10.292 --> 48:14.215
So much time that example
becomes your second nature.

48:14.216 --> 48:17.179
You say you're not your
brother's keeper, but you are.

48:17.604 --> 48:21.216
These actions he takes, he only does so

48:21.569 --> 48:24.688
because you have done so before.

48:25.439 --> 48:27.405
And your brother.

48:28.300 --> 48:30.338
Would you betray him?

48:31.512 --> 48:33.661
He betrayed me.

48:36.954 --> 48:39.485
That's not what I asked you, is it, sir?

48:41.826 --> 48:43.358
Miss!

48:44.091 --> 48:46.596
You are Miss Lily Timson?

48:47.028 --> 48:49.228
And you are a policeman?

48:49.446 --> 48:51.797
Miss Timson, if you'll stop, please.

48:51.915 --> 48:53.695
You are to come with me to Leman Street.

48:53.696 --> 48:55.625
There are questions to be answered.

48:57.367 --> 48:58.771
Are there indeed?

48:59.307 --> 49:00.740
On what subject?

49:00.742 --> 49:02.241
All will become clear, miss.

49:02.243 --> 49:03.709
Please, follow me.

49:06.848 --> 49:08.326
All right, Lil?

49:11.793 --> 49:14.120
This one harassing you?

49:16.780 --> 49:19.961
Let us get this blue bottle bagged.

49:29.718 --> 49:33.887
Pubs, Inspector, pubs
and publicans assaulted,

49:33.889 --> 49:35.922
harassed, all and any,

49:35.924 --> 49:37.190
citywide.

49:38.455 --> 49:43.319
If only it was all billy
clubs and bloody knuckles...

49:43.426 --> 49:46.885
If that was the case, I would
never have left Whitechapel.

49:46.886 --> 49:48.019
This here.

49:48.673 --> 49:51.247
Bills and invoicing for all liquid stock

49:51.248 --> 49:53.024
at The Lamb and Flag.

49:53.026 --> 49:55.305
This here the same for the Hogshead,

49:55.306 --> 49:56.687
Grimes' house.

49:56.881 --> 50:01.387
Here, two months past,
Bartleby changes his supplier.

50:01.388 --> 50:03.987
Decides his mild and his pale ale will now

50:03.994 --> 50:07.300
be supplied and delivered from
the Burton-on-Trent Breweries.

50:07.738 --> 50:11.342
Two weeks past, Grimes
makes the same decision.

50:11.586 --> 50:13.887
A man might accordingly lay good money that

50:13.888 --> 50:16.552
the gravely injured Mr. Parker

50:16.916 --> 50:19.350
ordered the same at The Feathers.

50:19.352 --> 50:21.219
And don't you want to know why?

50:23.484 --> 50:24.855
You, American,

50:24.857 --> 50:26.878
whose range of expertise

50:26.879 --> 50:30.421
is so breathtakingly vast
that it now fixes itself

50:30.422 --> 50:34.131
upon the beers and brews
of the United Kingdom.

50:34.683 --> 50:37.463
The beer, that rank soup that you all

50:37.464 --> 50:40.340
pour down yourselves like
it's Victoria's own bath water

50:40.400 --> 50:43.107
and that which was forced
into our two publicans, now,

50:43.109 --> 50:44.350
there was something of note.

50:44.351 --> 50:45.691
It's the water content.

50:46.813 --> 50:49.413
The alkalinity was low.

50:49.415 --> 50:52.817
Soft water, heavy in sulphites.

50:52.819 --> 50:53.982
Not London water.

50:53.983 --> 50:55.233
Not London water,

50:55.289 --> 50:57.770
But Burton water, from the bloody north?

50:58.095 --> 51:01.792
No sulphites better suited
for that mellow fruitfulness

51:01.794 --> 51:03.427
that you enjoy in your brew.

51:03.429 --> 51:06.208
But north country beer
drunk on these city streets,

51:06.208 --> 51:09.333
over which the black eagle
of the London Brewery soars,

51:09.335 --> 51:12.355
Local men might be put out of local work.

51:12.356 --> 51:15.861
And so? What, the young men of the brewery

51:15.861 --> 51:18.826
Had to show the publicans
the error of their ways?

51:19.166 --> 51:22.710
You will order our pale,
not that Northern slop,

51:23.090 --> 51:26.219
or you will know the inside of a barrel.

51:26.321 --> 51:29.505
A body of young men set on
protecting an institution

51:29.505 --> 51:31.564
which gives them more than only their work.

51:31.564 --> 51:35.747
It educates them, gives
them a sense of belonging.

51:35.749 --> 51:39.885
They act to protect both their
product and their traditions.

51:40.574 --> 51:41.687
It's like the army.

51:41.688 --> 51:42.956
Or the police.

51:43.690 --> 51:45.375
But those men in their barrels,

51:45.376 --> 51:48.971
whose limbs were broken
and packed like animals.

51:49.563 --> 51:52.425
That's both fierce brutality
and sharp escalation

51:52.426 --> 51:54.089
from your man Parker at The Feathers.

51:55.001 --> 51:58.744
Maybe this younger
Shipman uses this brutality

51:58.745 --> 52:00.408
to mark himself out for leader.

52:03.917 --> 52:05.116
Mr. Abberline,

52:05.117 --> 52:07.618
Mr. Drake, you must hear this.

52:07.746 --> 52:09.905
Grace has been taken.

52:10.415 --> 52:12.732
Do you know what will befall me, sir,

52:12.851 --> 52:15.585
If they know I have come here and told you?

52:15.587 --> 52:20.512
And yet you are here, miss,
you and your Teddy both.

52:21.329 --> 52:23.593
Now, whatever like, we have him,

52:23.595 --> 52:27.030
he who is not a great many
days longer for this life.

52:29.126 --> 52:30.292
The lad,

52:30.333 --> 52:32.600
PC Grace, he who came to find you?

52:33.071 --> 52:35.332
He's a good lad, a kind lad.

52:35.333 --> 52:36.673
You could tell, I'm sure.

52:38.069 --> 52:40.009
He is, I could.

52:40.011 --> 52:41.425
And you will come here now

52:41.506 --> 52:43.678
because you fear for him.

52:46.348 --> 52:48.936
It is Walter that has taken him, is it not?

52:50.144 --> 52:52.255
He's a cruel one, Mr. Drake.

52:52.684 --> 52:54.942
It's only Teddy who knows
how to keep a lid on him.

52:54.943 --> 52:58.988
But Teddy is here now, so
it's not merely a bruising

52:58.989 --> 53:01.175
he will hand out to our Bobby Grace.

53:01.606 --> 53:04.934
He has killed, Lily, twice.

53:10.079 --> 53:11.468
Awhiles ago,

53:11.543 --> 53:15.408
a long whiles ago, you lied to the police

53:15.409 --> 53:17.947
to protect your Teddy, did you not?

53:19.570 --> 53:24.126
You wish to make amends for your
lies, you might have words with Teddy,

53:24.145 --> 53:27.106
Persuade him it is best
for all that he speak,

53:27.107 --> 53:29.500
tell us where we will find our boy.

53:34.758 --> 53:35.829
Hey.

53:46.435 --> 53:49.582
Now, what he does, he does for you,

53:49.916 --> 53:52.171
to show you that he might also use murder

53:52.172 --> 53:54.283
to protect the Black Eagle's work.

53:54.284 --> 53:57.118
Therefore his acts are your acts.

54:00.959 --> 54:03.161
You're dying, Teddy.

54:04.320 --> 54:06.720
You want to do a good thing before you die?

54:23.266 --> 54:26.741
Here, my men, a blue boy.

54:26.742 --> 54:32.435
A blue boy who now takes
his place in our story.

54:32.522 --> 54:37.459
A blue boy who shall be
spoke of and remembered

54:37.461 --> 54:39.427
for what will now befall him.

54:40.645 --> 54:42.197
I know

54:42.863 --> 54:46.247
you fear what will come
once my Teddy has left us,

54:46.248 --> 54:49.942
but this here, what now comes to pass,

54:49.949 --> 54:53.067
shall offer us safeguards
for a hundred years.

54:53.068 --> 54:53.987
Please.

54:54.708 --> 54:56.180
Please listen.

54:56.360 --> 54:57.359
Do not listen.

54:57.487 --> 54:59.249
I'm not so different to many of you.

54:59.372 --> 55:01.001
Yourself, Walter.

55:02.410 --> 55:06.162
You put me in a barrel, Walter Shipman,

55:06.299 --> 55:09.504
You will gain nothing
but your own destruction!

55:09.505 --> 55:10.537
Destruction?

55:10.950 --> 55:13.034
No destruction, Constable,

55:13.035 --> 55:14.067
But glory!

55:21.789 --> 55:22.922
See?

55:22.964 --> 55:24.169
The others,

55:24.170 --> 55:26.526
it was their own brew I made them swallow.

55:26.528 --> 55:29.177
But you, you shall know a little more

55:29.178 --> 55:30.766
of what we here defend.

55:30.885 --> 55:33.050
It'll be London beer you now drink.

55:58.798 --> 56:00.279
Mr. Snelling!

56:00.280 --> 56:02.111
This a surprise for you, is it?

56:02.798 --> 56:04.101
Of course. What is it you do?

56:04.101 --> 56:04.769
Do?

56:04.770 --> 56:07.276
I come to take my boy back from your boys,

56:07.277 --> 56:08.611
and do not be thinking

56:08.613 --> 56:10.759
that I believe them able
to organise themselves

56:10.760 --> 56:15.140
to such a degree without their
master offering a helping hand!

56:15.141 --> 56:16.018
Aah!

56:18.889 --> 56:20.314
You show us now.

56:32.549 --> 56:34.378
That will do, Walt!

56:37.817 --> 56:39.144
I'll snap his neck.

56:39.748 --> 56:41.598
Teddy.

56:41.748 --> 56:44.015
You're friends with the
police now, are you, brother?

56:44.016 --> 56:46.866
My fight was never with the police,
Walter, and neither is yours.

56:47.553 --> 56:50.066
Who is that lad to deserve our anger?

56:50.068 --> 56:53.701
A murdering, for a brew, for beer?

56:53.751 --> 56:55.057
But you, Teddy.

56:55.057 --> 56:56.597
You set the mark.

56:56.684 --> 56:58.168
You showed us the way.

56:58.168 --> 57:00.883
By ending it off with Parker
at The Feathers, you mean?

57:02.473 --> 57:06.307
Killing a man for not taking our pale ale?

57:07.354 --> 57:09.319
It was never meant, Walt.

57:09.585 --> 57:12.228
I gave him a couple of
hits, yes, but that was all.

57:12.807 --> 57:13.998
The fire.

57:14.927 --> 57:17.522
I knocked over a lantern, didn't I?

57:18.924 --> 57:21.336
Smashed the place up good and proper.

57:22.540 --> 57:26.283
He was all sloshed with
brandy, and, whoosh.

57:27.339 --> 57:30.909
He went up, and I ran.

57:31.143 --> 57:32.886
That is all.

57:33.091 --> 57:36.778
And if we have lived off
of similar affairs since,

57:36.779 --> 57:38.537
that was not my intention.

57:40.629 --> 57:43.276
Time goes on, Walter.

57:43.667 --> 57:45.129
All things pass.

57:46.177 --> 57:49.794
You know the world will always
have need for brewing about.

57:50.233 --> 57:53.540
There is no law that say
the Black Eagle must endure.

57:55.643 --> 57:57.036
All things must pass.

57:59.273 --> 58:00.223
I must.

58:02.291 --> 58:03.529
You must.

58:05.766 --> 58:07.449
This whole building must.

58:11.343 --> 58:13.021
Let him be.

58:14.631 --> 58:16.012
Let him be.

58:20.187 --> 58:21.163
Now!

58:25.821 --> 58:27.226
Grace.

58:27.228 --> 58:28.728
If you hear me, look at me.

58:35.364 --> 58:37.431
Move it!

58:40.717 --> 58:41.783
Get off!

58:42.097 --> 58:43.808
You turncoat, Teddy!

58:43.809 --> 58:45.114
Move.

01:00:14.747 --> 01:00:17.504
Captain Jackson, I'm not sure I have

01:00:17.505 --> 01:00:19.272
ever been sent for before now.

01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:22.304
For the life of me, I cannot
think why I have responded.

01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:27.567
Mimi, do you think we
might forgo the backchatter?

01:00:28.434 --> 01:00:31.578
Then why on earth am I here?

01:00:32.589 --> 01:00:34.919
This day,

01:00:36.564 --> 01:00:39.431
I feel the hand of death upon me.

01:00:39.932 --> 01:00:41.967
I look back into the past,

01:00:42.924 --> 01:00:45.365
I see what made me, and I just...

01:00:45.604 --> 01:00:47.898
I feel sick with it.

01:00:50.544 --> 01:00:53.574
And I would like to...

01:00:53.697 --> 01:00:56.642
rest my head on the lap of someone who...

01:01:00.375 --> 01:01:03.060
s-s-someone...

01:01:06.412 --> 01:01:07.783
God damn it!

01:01:10.297 --> 01:01:12.172
You are the only thing I have in this world

01:01:12.173 --> 01:01:14.366
to take the lead from my limbs.

01:01:24.412 --> 01:01:26.624
- Well, this is a day for firsts.
- Please,

01:01:26.861 --> 01:01:28.636
you can use that tongue of yours

01:01:28.637 --> 01:01:31.286
to whip strips from me every
other hour we pass together,

01:01:31.287 --> 01:01:32.967
but please just tell me,

01:01:33.736 --> 01:01:36.253
am I a fool to rest this hope in you?

01:01:38.592 --> 01:01:40.531
Fool, certainly.

01:01:44.088 --> 01:01:46.832
But not one misled.

01:02:14.195 --> 01:02:15.994
Kill him!

01:02:24.949 --> 01:02:26.515
Hello?

01:02:32.011 --> 01:02:33.877
Mr. Reid.

01:02:34.191 --> 01:02:35.991
Edmund.

01:02:39.553 --> 01:02:41.315
Sir.

01:02:41.869 --> 01:02:43.584
Who am I?
