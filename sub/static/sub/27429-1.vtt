00:22.345 --> 00:25.054
Hey, guys! It's Mariana.
We just made it to LA.

00:25.082 --> 00:27.228
Say hi, Callie.

00:35.504 --> 00:37.239
Hey, you single?

00:37.281 --> 00:39.946
My God! Stop!

00:39.994 --> 00:42.900
- Okay, eyes on the road.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:42.933 --> 00:46.700
I just got a job at a tech
startup as a software engineer.

00:46.704 --> 00:49.316
- Making six figures!
- Callie!

00:49.338 --> 00:51.396
Anyway, heads up you "bro-grammers,"

00:51.418 --> 00:54.906
you're lookin' at MIT's Beerio
Kart champ, class of 2018.

00:54.928 --> 00:56.416
 Yay!

00:56.442 --> 00:59.121
Okay, so I just
graduated from law school.

00:59.129 --> 01:01.964
- Summa cum laude.
- Magna cum laude.

01:02.014 --> 01:04.166
Okay, well, regardless, it's a laude,

01:04.167 --> 01:06.320
and she's working as a
clerk for a federal judge

01:06.358 --> 01:08.423
which is a pretty big friggin' deal.

01:08.467 --> 01:10.839
- We're so lit.
- We're pretty lit.

01:10.883 --> 01:14.095
We're straight up fire!

01:14.106 --> 01:15.965
Yay! Whoo!

01:18.562 --> 01:22.333
- $250?
- You parked in the yellow.

01:22.388 --> 01:25.312
No. Commercial vehicles
can park in the yellow.

01:25.753 --> 01:28.292
U-Haul's not a commercial vehicle.

01:35.526 --> 01:38.100
Okay, are you sure we
can park in the yellow?

01:38.330 --> 01:40.231
Yeah, positive.

01:40.356 --> 01:42.589
Commercial vehicles
can park in the yellow.

01:47.594 --> 01:49.236
Wait. This is it?

01:49.361 --> 01:50.763
The Palace Theater.

01:50.824 --> 01:52.885
- We're gonna live here?
- Right?

01:53.463 --> 01:54.739
Cool.

02:01.094 --> 02:03.519
Hello? Where's your credit card?

02:03.740 --> 02:06.548
You're the one who was positive
we could park in the yellow.

02:06.885 --> 02:08.687
I can't believe you're not paying half.

02:08.716 --> 02:10.756
I can't believe you
moved us into a commune.

02:11.049 --> 02:13.670
I did not move us into a commune...

02:14.966 --> 02:16.197
exactly.

02:23.402 --> 02:27.286
Okay, so, ager's name is Alice.

02:31.739 --> 02:33.973
What's a Sad Girl Party?

02:34.098 --> 02:36.760
I don't know. It sounds perfect for you.

02:38.849 --> 02:41.344
She knew we were coming.

02:41.469 --> 02:43.993
Why don't you call your
friend who lives here?

02:44.042 --> 02:45.444
He's not my friend.

02:45.477 --> 02:48.268
He's my soon-to-be co-worker
slash future boyfriend.

02:48.296 --> 02:50.188
And I don't want him thinking
that I'm some kind of stalker

02:50.204 --> 02:52.039
'cause I'm calling him the
second I move into his building.

02:52.063 --> 02:54.082
'Cause moving into his
building in the first place

02:54.096 --> 02:55.482
isn't stalkerish at all.

02:55.495 --> 02:57.950
He's the one who told me
that this loft was available.

02:57.968 --> 02:59.374
Well, then...

02:59.886 --> 03:02.129
"The Coterie at the Palace

03:02.146 --> 03:04.642
is an intentional community."

03:05.054 --> 03:08.077
Intentional community?

03:10.095 --> 03:11.644
Hold up. Hey!

03:11.684 --> 03:13.978
Give me a second. Give me a second.

03:15.774 --> 03:17.577
Are you Mariana and Callie?

03:17.593 --> 03:19.701
- Yes.
- I'm so sorry.

03:19.702 --> 03:22.755
Shit. I'm sorry. I mean, I'm not sorry.

03:22.782 --> 03:24.718
I've been trying not to say
I'm sorry. As a feminist.

03:24.742 --> 03:26.091
As women, we're just raised

03:26.115 --> 03:27.964
to apologize left and right, you know?

03:27.994 --> 03:30.189
Finally. I had to wipe
with the cardboard roll.

03:30.398 --> 03:32.094
Sorry. Shit.

03:32.124 --> 03:35.324
See what I mean. It's hard.
Come on. Let's go upstairs.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.047
You know, I thought that

03:37.069 --> 03:38.889
free toilet paper would be a nice perk,

03:38.910 --> 03:40.645
but,

03:40.692 --> 03:43.166
I had no idea how much
people would over-wipe.

03:43.594 --> 03:44.874
You wouldn't believe it.

03:48.813 --> 03:50.959
Hope you guys are eco-friendly.

03:51.381 --> 03:53.640
And the plastic's for the leaks.

04:00.097 --> 04:02.180
This is our communal bathroom.

04:08.905 --> 04:11.789
You going to work?
Hardest-working  I know.

04:11.914 --> 04:15.377
Not the cleanest though.
Hah! Our communal kitchen.

04:15.397 --> 04:17.300
Pretty nice, right?

04:18.242 --> 04:21.459
- Which one of y'all swiped my cold brew again.
- Was your name on it?

04:21.493 --> 04:23.810
Y'all don't need my name on
it to know it's not yours.

04:23.834 --> 04:26.390
Malika, meet our new Coterie members,

04:26.416 --> 04:28.542
Callie and Mariana Adams Foster.

04:31.158 --> 04:33.689
Don't leave anything you
wanna keep in the fridge.

04:33.814 --> 04:35.948
She needs her caffeine.

04:35.980 --> 04:38.619
Especially in the afternoon, you know.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.560
I'm sure he used hand sanitizer.

04:43.604 --> 04:46.367
Ha! Now I don't even
need to read the book

04:46.380 --> 04:48.187
or see the new motion
picture based on the book

04:48.191 --> 04:50.075
because I know you're the book thief!

04:50.097 --> 04:52.285
You're in for a treat. He's really good.

04:52.319 --> 04:53.922
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

04:53.946 --> 04:55.480
You just couldn't help yourself.

04:55.494 --> 04:57.121
That's why you stole the books.

04:57.168 --> 04:58.530
- Yes.
- This is our lounge

04:58.538 --> 05:00.959
where we all hang out
unless there's, like, a salon

05:00.991 --> 05:02.254
or improv class scheduled.

05:02.294 --> 05:04.089
You know, you'd
probably be good at that.

05:04.178 --> 05:05.400
You...

05:06.384 --> 05:07.690
Next.

05:07.815 --> 05:09.386
Can we see our loft now?

05:11.344 --> 05:13.014
Welcome to your new home.

05:14.658 --> 05:16.055
Let it marinate.

05:20.158 --> 05:21.341
She's a beauty.

05:24.699 --> 05:27.904
So, we don't have our
own kitchen or bathroom?

05:28.071 --> 05:30.608
No. I mean, none of us do.

05:30.638 --> 05:33.223
You can always get one of
those chamber pots, you know.

05:33.253 --> 05:35.103
But don't poop in it

05:35.385 --> 05:37.666
'cause we kinda have a mouse problem.

05:38.559 --> 05:40.994
It's just they might, you know,

05:41.044 --> 05:42.652
eat your poop at night.

05:43.123 --> 05:44.669
Depending on your diet of course.

05:44.794 --> 05:48.604
Just stay away from
anything that... has flavor.

05:48.884 --> 05:52.553
Okay, um, just let me know if
you need the Wi-Fi password...

05:52.678 --> 05:54.193
or anything like that.

05:56.934 --> 05:59.861
I had no idea about the
whole communal living thing.

06:01.733 --> 06:04.540
Okay, look, right now,
it's empty and dusty,

06:04.557 --> 06:06.227
but the windows are fantastic.

06:06.244 --> 06:08.346
And as soon as we clean it up
and put all of our stuff in,

06:08.368 --> 06:09.602
it's gonna feel like home.

06:09.624 --> 06:11.218
At a price you can afford.

06:11.343 --> 06:13.183
- Me?
- Yes.

06:13.194 --> 06:15.238
You can only afford to
pay 800 bucks a month,

06:15.251 --> 06:17.598
and you didn't want me to pay more
because of the "balance of power."

06:17.622 --> 06:18.834
Let's make the best of it.

06:18.874 --> 06:20.151
There it is.

06:35.788 --> 06:37.441
What the...

06:57.683 --> 06:59.136
It could be worse.

06:59.364 --> 07:01.042
We have our mattresses.

07:01.076 --> 07:02.277
And our health.

07:02.332 --> 07:04.874
Your health is in
serious danger right now.

07:04.914 --> 07:06.490
Can I get a shot of tequila please?

07:06.537 --> 07:08.037
- Ooh, me too.
- Yep.

07:08.922 --> 07:11.417
- He's hot.
- Seriously?

07:12.494 --> 07:14.143
When's the last time you got laid?

07:14.168 --> 07:16.518
And that's your solution to all this?

07:16.553 --> 07:18.270
That's my solution to everything.

07:18.322 --> 07:20.915
Can we talk about the fact that
everything we own was stolen

07:20.949 --> 07:22.984
and we have nothing to
wear to work tomorrow.

07:23.479 --> 07:26.862
Well, now we have an
excuse to go shopping.

07:28.798 --> 07:29.930
Ready?

07:32.170 --> 07:33.774
No.

07:34.134 --> 07:36.172
No, no, no, no, no.

07:42.094 --> 07:44.363
If this doesn't scream
first day on the job,

07:44.374 --> 07:46.976
I don't know what does.

07:59.228 --> 08:00.479
Sorry.

08:01.031 --> 08:02.224
How cute would this be?

08:02.349 --> 08:04.565
No. Those ruffles.

08:08.024 --> 08:09.717
Twerk, twerk, twerk.

08:21.015 --> 08:23.824
My god, it's you!

08:24.245 --> 08:26.937
She's precious.

08:30.004 --> 08:31.124
It's you.

08:31.164 --> 08:32.820
It is!

08:46.587 --> 08:48.710
Shit. Mariana.

08:49.517 --> 08:50.902
Mariana, get up.

08:50.936 --> 08:52.480
Mariana, get up!

08:52.504 --> 08:53.644
We're late.

08:53.694 --> 08:54.948
Come on.

08:55.564 --> 08:58.446
Why did I think that this dress
was a good idea last night?

08:58.468 --> 08:59.779
Because we were hammered.

08:59.797 --> 09:01.681
But you shouldn't have to
conform to some dress code

09:01.704 --> 09:04.498
- to prove you're smart.
- Right. You're right.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.744
Okay, what about me?

09:06.784 --> 09:08.403
How dated does this suit look?

09:08.424 --> 09:10.448
The shoulder pads are
a little 1980s Dynasty,

09:10.475 --> 09:12.308
but they're making a comeback.

09:12.329 --> 09:13.985
Gael!

09:22.144 --> 09:24.980
Hey. It's Mariana.

09:24.996 --> 09:27.041
I met you the other day when
I interviewed at Speckulate?

09:27.063 --> 09:29.722
Right, yeah, that's right.
Mariana. How are you?

09:29.786 --> 09:31.149
Hey.

09:31.345 --> 09:33.719
Thanks for the heads-up
on the loft, by the way.

09:33.743 --> 09:35.144
We just moved in yesterday.

09:35.194 --> 09:36.609
This is my sister Callie.

09:36.793 --> 09:38.475
Nice to meet you.

10:53.060 --> 10:54.377
Hey.

10:55.109 --> 10:56.360
Hey.

11:05.660 --> 11:06.946
Do you live here?

11:07.405 --> 11:09.841
I... Yeah, just moved in today.

11:12.249 --> 11:13.840
I like your slippers.

11:18.342 --> 11:20.217
They're my sister's.

11:21.108 --> 11:22.420
I'm Gael.

11:41.934 --> 11:43.627
Nice to meet you too.

11:45.634 --> 11:48.070
So today's my first day at Speckulate.

11:48.120 --> 11:50.318
That's great. Maybe I'll see you there.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.363
Maybe.

11:53.597 --> 11:55.040
You have a nice day.

11:59.250 --> 12:02.425
Okay, is he not the hottest
 to grace this Earth?

12:02.788 --> 12:04.203
I'm so gonna smash him.

12:04.230 --> 12:06.131
All right, have a good first day.

12:06.500 --> 12:09.325
Yeah. You too.

12:40.500 --> 12:43.026
Your credentials and your key card.

12:43.151 --> 12:44.645
Keep in mind that whatever happens

12:44.650 --> 12:46.465
within these chambers is confidential.

12:46.652 --> 12:49.916
You don't talk about the
cases outside these walls.

12:50.092 --> 12:52.997
You don't tell anyone
which cases you're clerking.

12:53.122 --> 12:55.754
Be careful what issues you tweet about

12:55.879 --> 12:57.578
and what posts you like.

12:57.830 --> 13:00.749
The point is to avoid any
appearance of impropriety

13:00.775 --> 13:02.556
that could reflect poorly on your judge.

13:02.821 --> 13:05.393
So, as you'll recall
from your interview tour,

13:05.423 --> 13:07.734
we have massages available every day.

13:07.756 --> 13:10.648
Our gym on the third
floor is open 24 hours.

13:10.683 --> 13:13.845
And that is our
meditation and yoga room.

13:13.892 --> 13:15.630
This is Rebecca. This is Ben.

13:15.686 --> 13:17.779
- Your fellow clerks.
- Hi.

13:17.827 --> 13:19.269
Hey. Nice to meet you.

13:19.322 --> 13:21.149
Hi, I'm Callie.

13:21.518 --> 13:23.878
Callie, welcome.

13:23.916 --> 13:25.849
- Hey.
- Glad you're here.

13:25.881 --> 13:28.279
Give me one second with
Barbara, then walk me to court.

13:29.651 --> 13:32.509
So where'd you go to law school?

13:35.100 --> 13:36.589
San Diego.

13:37.348 --> 13:40.045
What about you?

13:40.093 --> 13:41.962
- Yale.
- Harvard.

13:43.458 --> 13:46.241
We have a full-time
coffee and tea barista,

13:46.280 --> 13:48.671
our kitchen is fully
stocked with snacks,

13:48.687 --> 13:51.635
sodas, kombucha, craft beers on tap.

13:51.683 --> 13:54.885
- And we offer a catered lunch.
- Wow. Nice.

13:54.939 --> 13:59.243
And Whiskey Fridays are a fun
time to get to know each other.

13:59.920 --> 14:02.630
Judge Wilson's about to
hear a motion to suppress,

14:02.670 --> 14:05.114
and he's gonna ask
you how he should rule.

14:05.300 --> 14:06.869
Don't be tempted to impress him.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.745
Just say you're not
comfortable giving an opinion

14:09.762 --> 14:12.360
without a thoughtful
analysis of the case.

14:13.115 --> 14:14.600
Rebecca?

14:14.675 --> 14:16.165
Excuse me.

14:16.235 --> 14:18.220
Is that Evan Speck?

14:18.398 --> 14:20.085
Yes.

14:20.117 --> 14:22.665
- Can I meet him?
- Eventually.

14:22.790 --> 14:24.160
But he's very busy.

14:24.219 --> 14:26.574
And he doesn't like being approached.

14:29.928 --> 14:31.371
Right this way.

14:31.950 --> 14:34.516
Don't listen to her. I'm
not saying she has an agenda,

14:34.532 --> 14:36.733
but being a clerk is all about
trying to impress your judge.

14:36.754 --> 14:39.686
So when you get an opportunity, take it.

14:41.977 --> 14:43.862
Don't be intimidated by Rebecca and Ben

14:43.878 --> 14:45.177
just 'cause they went
to Ivy League schools.

14:45.190 --> 14:47.413
Which they're gonna remind
you of every chance they get.

14:47.710 --> 14:50.952
I always choose one state school
grad to clerk in my office.

14:51.005 --> 14:52.565
I'm honored to be here.

14:53.329 --> 14:55.043
So, we've got a criminal defendant

14:55.102 --> 14:58.066
moving to suppress the
seizure of ten kilos of cocaine

14:58.092 --> 14:59.416
found in a warehouse.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.334
Now, he's arguing that the cocaine

15:01.350 --> 15:03.320
is inadmissible as evidence

15:03.353 --> 15:07.214
because it was found due to
an illegal wiretap of his phone

15:07.220 --> 15:09.425
in which he told his
buyer where to find it.

15:09.505 --> 15:11.336
Don't be tempted to impress him.

15:11.360 --> 15:14.292
An infort after the fact. So...

15:14.366 --> 15:15.820
how should I rule?

15:16.476 --> 15:18.954
When you get an opportunity, take it.

15:20.348 --> 15:23.280
Based on the "fruit of the
poisonous tree" doctrine,

15:23.322 --> 15:27.214
any evidence found through that
illegal wiretap should be inadmissible.

15:27.503 --> 15:30.008
Therefore, I would grant
the motion to suppress.

15:30.280 --> 15:31.396
No.

15:32.224 --> 15:35.140
No, the infort's
tip, even after the fact,

15:35.215 --> 15:37.581
would have provided cause
for a lawfully issued warrant.

15:37.623 --> 15:40.643
Which falls easily within the
exception for "inevitable discovery."

15:44.125 --> 15:46.620
Never give an uninformed
opinion, Callie.

15:52.263 --> 15:54.495
Yeah, just, just play it.

15:58.514 --> 16:01.257
Alex. Alex.

16:01.337 --> 16:02.970
- Look at that expression.
- Alex!

16:04.815 --> 16:07.506
Hey, Angela.

16:07.560 --> 16:08.772
What's up?

16:08.804 --> 16:11.930
This is, Mariana Adams Foster.

16:12.132 --> 16:13.536
Hi.

16:15.155 --> 16:18.149
She's joining your team?

16:18.184 --> 16:19.935
Yeah.

16:19.957 --> 16:21.060
Hey.

16:22.533 --> 16:24.956
Okay, then I will leave you to it.

16:29.892 --> 16:31.644
So...

16:32.296 --> 16:34.305
- This is Sam...
- What up?

16:34.342 --> 16:36.328
- And Raj.
- Hey.

16:36.453 --> 16:38.310
Welcome to the team.

16:38.891 --> 16:40.413
Thanks.

16:41.636 --> 16:44.889
So, I've done my homework
and I'm really excited

16:44.921 --> 16:46.681
about all of the apps
that you're developing.

16:46.715 --> 16:50.251
And I have a few ideas that
I'd love to pitch to you

16:50.326 --> 16:51.800
when the time is right.

16:52.056 --> 16:56.013
So, for real? You're an engineer?

16:56.425 --> 16:59.655
Yes. I just graduated from MIT

16:59.666 --> 17:02.160
where my main focus was
artificial intelligence

17:02.181 --> 17:03.930
- and machine building.
- Cool.

17:03.970 --> 17:07.333
Okay, well, we'll get you
started on some data entry.

17:08.636 --> 17:09.901
Data entry?

17:09.940 --> 17:12.093
Yeah, data entry.

17:13.609 --> 17:14.819
Okay.

17:16.272 --> 17:18.194
Great. You can work over there.

17:18.232 --> 17:20.800
The data folder's on the desktop.

17:23.825 --> 17:26.976
Rebecca and Ben each gave
you a third of their cases.

17:27.101 --> 17:29.886
Since they got to choose, I
assume they're the most tedious.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.252
From now on, you get every
third case that comes in.

17:32.294 --> 17:34.222
And you need to read this.

17:38.912 --> 17:40.310
How'd it go?

17:41.699 --> 17:44.647
Let's just say, I wish
I'd taken your advice.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.051
But you took Ben's? What did he say?

17:47.078 --> 17:48.621
That you couldn't trust me?

17:48.653 --> 17:51.654
That I only got this clerkship
because my grandfather's a US Senator?

17:51.693 --> 17:52.804
He is?

17:53.205 --> 17:56.601
That's not why I got this
job. And Ben's not your friend.

17:56.644 --> 17:57.887
What're you talking about?

17:57.913 --> 17:59.408
Case assignments.

18:02.095 --> 18:04.390
I didn't give you all my boring ones.

18:25.727 --> 18:27.034
So...

18:27.599 --> 18:29.004
you from LA?

18:29.367 --> 18:31.390
No. San Diego.

18:33.268 --> 18:35.247
What brings you to La La Land?

18:35.905 --> 18:37.190
You an actress?

18:39.801 --> 18:42.344
- You a model?
- Um, no.

18:43.113 --> 18:44.537
I'm a doctor.

18:46.660 --> 18:48.304
I'm just kidding.

18:49.330 --> 18:50.346
I'm a lawyer.

18:55.614 --> 18:57.000
You're serious.

18:57.229 --> 18:58.588
Afraid so.

19:00.395 --> 19:01.630
That's cool.

19:01.968 --> 19:04.724
So what do you do? Are you an actor?

19:05.121 --> 19:08.040
No. Graphic designer.

19:08.165 --> 19:09.458
By day.

19:09.544 --> 19:11.039
Crime fighter by night?

19:12.458 --> 19:13.915
Artist.

19:14.496 --> 19:16.427
Or at least trying to be.

19:17.671 --> 19:20.187
I do my studies in clay

19:20.222 --> 19:22.674
then cast in bronze or copper.

19:23.720 --> 19:27.885
I tried to get into the
art program at UCSD before

19:28.069 --> 19:30.491
I decided to go to law school.

19:31.302 --> 19:34.195
Art and law seem like worlds apart.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.314
What's that one quote?

19:36.361 --> 19:40.010
"Law is reason free from passion."

19:40.189 --> 19:41.997
I guess everyone saw Legally Blonde.

19:43.424 --> 19:44.839
Nah, it's just...

19:45.518 --> 19:48.150
I don't know, art
seems all about passion.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.270
What's this one called?

19:52.602 --> 19:54.197
"In Stasis."

19:56.889 --> 19:58.179
It's beautiful.

20:01.597 --> 20:05.828
The idea was to achieve a sense
of stillness in the midst of chaos.

20:09.662 --> 20:11.532
I know a lot about chaos.

20:23.298 --> 20:26.220
I'd like to see some
of your work some time.

22:19.830 --> 22:22.776
It's a one bedroom. And it
has a kitchen and a bathroom.

22:22.829 --> 22:25.232
- How much is it?
- $3,200.

22:25.269 --> 22:28.271
- $3,200! You can't afford that.
- Yeah, but you can.

22:28.340 --> 22:30.071
What happened to "balance of power?"

22:30.087 --> 22:32.742
You can have the bedroom,
and I'll sleep on the couch.

22:32.758 --> 22:34.600
The Coterie is not that bad.

22:34.640 --> 22:37.383
- We can't live there, Mariana.
- Why not?

22:38.730 --> 22:40.427
- It's Mom.
- It's Mama.

22:40.951 --> 22:43.151
Okay, don't mention
the U-Haul, all right.

22:43.167 --> 22:44.422
It'll just worry them
and make it look like

22:44.438 --> 22:46.190
we can't handle being on our own. Okay?

22:46.227 --> 22:47.813
Definitely.

22:49.399 --> 22:51.338
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, Mama.

22:53.447 --> 22:55.193
No. I'm fine.

22:57.640 --> 23:00.177
- Yeah, don't worry. We've got this.
- No, no, I'm, I'm fine.

23:00.215 --> 23:02.615
- I just miss you guys is all.
- Everything's gonna be great.

23:02.981 --> 23:04.968
She wants to talk to you.

23:06.570 --> 23:08.204
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, Mama.

23:08.253 --> 23:10.511
- Yeah. No, no, she's fine.
- No, I told Mama, I'm fine.

23:10.592 --> 23:12.295
- Don't worry. I know.
- No, she is.

23:12.349 --> 23:15.080
- I love you too.
- It's just Mariana being Mariana.

23:15.117 --> 23:16.511
You know how it is.

23:17.013 --> 23:18.760
Okay, love you too.

23:20.725 --> 23:22.236
I'm sorry.

23:22.765 --> 23:24.592
I just heard her voice and I cracked.

23:24.624 --> 23:27.030
Are you sure everything
was okay at work today?

23:27.540 --> 23:30.857
Yeah, no, it... it was great.

24:03.057 --> 24:04.390
Hey.

24:04.515 --> 24:07.223
Hey, I didn't see you there.

24:07.440 --> 24:08.960
I was just looking for a place to sit.

24:09.140 --> 24:11.281
You could sit with us.

24:11.474 --> 24:13.471
Thanks.

24:18.145 --> 24:20.313
Hey, guys, this is, Mariana.

24:20.323 --> 24:23.535
- She's our new software engineer.
- Hi.

24:23.971 --> 24:26.774
So why aren't you sitting
over there with the geniuses?

24:26.828 --> 24:30.225
Well, I mean, it's,
it's not high school, right?

24:30.294 --> 24:32.442
I don't have to sit with the cool kids.

24:34.274 --> 24:37.568
- Not that you guys aren't cool.
- What was that?

24:38.028 --> 24:39.747
You guys are cool.

24:41.932 --> 24:43.520
How do you two know each other?

24:43.732 --> 24:47.102
We live together.

24:47.166 --> 24:49.345
Not like together, together.

24:49.355 --> 24:52.852
At least not yet, anyway.

24:56.076 --> 24:58.226
- Do we have a flat white?
- Yes.

24:58.232 --> 25:00.375
I'll have what she's having.

25:03.086 --> 25:07.533
I'm Mariana. It's my first
day here. I'm Casey.

25:08.154 --> 25:11.171
- Are you an engineer here?
- Yeah.

25:11.296 --> 25:13.029
Me too.

25:13.045 --> 25:14.710
I'm glad I'm not the only one.

25:16.533 --> 25:18.674
Wo.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.389
What are you working on?

25:20.405 --> 25:23.283
My team is developing a lifestyle app.

25:23.352 --> 25:25.879
You're a team leader?

25:25.895 --> 25:27.637
That's amazing.

25:28.769 --> 25:30.323
Can I ask how you did it?

25:30.560 --> 25:33.069
Was it almost impossible?

25:34.057 --> 25:35.819
Came up with a good idea,

25:35.845 --> 25:39.088
pitched it to Evan, he liked
it, and he let me run with it.

25:39.213 --> 25:40.653
Wow.

25:40.778 --> 25:43.386
It's good to know that
there's opportunity here.

25:43.958 --> 25:46.842
You know, I'd love to
pick your brain sometime,

25:46.848 --> 25:48.354
ask your advice.

25:48.391 --> 25:50.694
Sure. First piece of advice?

25:50.726 --> 25:52.787
It's annoying, but, um...

25:53.460 --> 25:57.175
you'll be taken more
seriously if you don't dress...

25:57.220 --> 25:58.646
like that.

25:59.090 --> 26:01.989
And don't be afraid to
sit with the boys at lunch.

26:01.999 --> 26:04.446
Right? You're an engineer,
speak up for yourself,

26:04.451 --> 26:06.631
and take your seat at the table.

26:15.021 --> 26:17.152
Alex, can I have a word?

26:17.190 --> 26:18.823
Yeah. What's up?

26:19.486 --> 26:22.792
Okay, look, I know today
is my first day, but...

26:23.011 --> 26:25.874
I was hired to develop software and...

26:26.322 --> 26:28.581
I'd really like to
create some prototypes

26:28.587 --> 26:31.512
or write some tests, review code even.

26:31.637 --> 26:36.121
Yeah, okay. Um, review the
code on the launcher app

26:36.137 --> 26:38.172
- for the eGIFany app.
- Look, I just...

26:38.877 --> 26:41.769
Okay. Great.

26:41.795 --> 26:44.679
Okay. Thanks.

27:00.561 --> 27:03.958
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-boobs.

27:08.177 --> 27:10.949
So overall, it was a
really good first day.

27:10.965 --> 27:13.333
- Good.
- Hey, ladies.

27:13.371 --> 27:14.775
You're just in time.

27:14.802 --> 27:16.835
Dennis just made vegan chicken adobo.

27:16.858 --> 27:18.343
You're welcome to eat with us.

27:18.396 --> 27:20.396
World's best vegan chicken adobo.

27:20.853 --> 27:22.332
Look.

27:23.587 --> 27:25.595
- Thank you. Um...
- Yeah, thanks.

27:25.611 --> 27:27.101
- I'm, I'm not...
- Hey.

27:27.497 --> 27:29.010
You guys gonna join?

27:29.366 --> 27:31.342
Yeah, we'd love to.

27:31.467 --> 27:33.620
- Okay. Family dinner.
- Hey, you got them.

27:33.650 --> 27:35.117
- Yes.
- Family dinner.

27:43.768 --> 27:45.274
And I had...

27:47.057 --> 27:49.616
- Guys are getting ball cancer.
- What?

27:51.261 --> 27:53.160
From cell phones in their pockets.

27:57.083 --> 27:58.536
Cell phones are an addiction.

27:58.584 --> 28:00.459
Like drugs, alcohol, and sex.

28:00.496 --> 28:02.681
Wait. I'm sorry, did you
say "sex" addiction, Dennis?

28:02.713 --> 28:04.222
I haven't brought a
girl home in two weeks.

28:04.246 --> 28:05.980
You're practically celibate.

28:05.997 --> 28:07.595
No.

28:12.448 --> 28:14.379
I'm not gonna take this anymore.

28:14.390 --> 28:15.936
- You guys done with this?
- Yeah, take it away.

28:15.960 --> 28:19.796
Not to mention, they promote
anti-social hu interaction, Malika.

28:19.818 --> 28:22.343
I bet you miss the
rotary phone, Dennis.

28:22.360 --> 28:23.936
And mix tapes.

28:23.970 --> 28:25.871
You know what? I do miss mix tapes.

28:25.889 --> 28:27.978
In fact, I'm gonna make
you a best of Bob Dylan.

28:28.012 --> 28:30.756
Okay, if social media
was invented in the 60s,

28:30.773 --> 28:33.113
Odetta would have been
way bigger than Bob Dylan.

28:33.135 --> 28:34.144
- True.
- I'm just saying.

28:34.165 --> 28:35.990
Can you imagine Twitter in 1968?

28:36.015 --> 28:38.027
My god. The Civil Rights Movement

28:38.040 --> 28:39.471
with the unfiltered truth.

28:39.484 --> 28:41.659
Social media for social justice...

28:41.702 --> 28:44.009
instead of showing off
what you had for lunch.

28:44.017 --> 28:45.611
- Hear, hear.
- Hey,

28:45.736 --> 28:47.956
my new post just got 500 likes.

28:47.978 --> 28:49.182
Can't have a single
dinner without a phone.

28:49.199 --> 28:51.673
Davia's a body-positive
Instagram influencer.

28:51.698 --> 28:54.330
I see these girls that I
teach starving themselves.

28:54.350 --> 28:55.484
I used to be anorexic.

28:55.535 --> 28:57.923
And I want them to
love their full figures

28:57.962 --> 28:59.286
and see that a healthy body

28:59.311 --> 29:01.422
- doesn't have to be a skinny body.
- Amen.

29:01.461 --> 29:02.674
Are you kidding me?

29:02.700 --> 29:05.580
Meet the latest son
of a friend of a friend

29:05.584 --> 29:06.796
that my mom's trying to set me up with.

29:06.820 --> 29:09.464
- Whoo!
- Can you mom give him my number?

29:09.473 --> 29:10.951
- Can't she give him my number?
- This is embarrassing.

29:10.960 --> 29:12.691
When're you just gonna
come out to your parents?

29:12.708 --> 29:14.656
- Yes.
- Never ever.

29:14.669 --> 29:17.482
Are you kidding? I'm, I'm already
this huge disappointment to them.

29:17.512 --> 29:20.045
What're you talking about,
girl? You age this building.

29:20.063 --> 29:21.870
Can you imagine how
lesbian would go over?

29:21.909 --> 29:23.498
Our moms are lesbians.

29:23.695 --> 29:25.260
But you're sisters?

29:25.300 --> 29:26.992
Yeah, we were adopted.

29:26.996 --> 29:28.278
When we were foster kids.

29:28.300 --> 29:29.833
I was in the system.

29:29.863 --> 29:31.282
Never got adopted though.

29:31.304 --> 29:34.602
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. I survived.

29:35.020 --> 29:37.400
So you're clerking for a federal judge?

29:37.465 --> 29:39.729
- Yeah.
- Not Judge Lawrence?

29:39.770 --> 29:41.753
No. Wilson. Why?

29:41.817 --> 29:44.701
Lawrence is working the Jamal
Thompson case. You heard about it?

29:44.736 --> 29:46.602
- I don't think so. No.
- Yeah.

29:46.679 --> 29:48.636
Just another police
shooting of a black .

29:48.660 --> 29:51.389
It's been five years, so with
a new shooting every week,

29:51.393 --> 29:52.912
it's hard for people
to remember these things

29:52.936 --> 29:55.669
once they finally get to
trial, if they do at all.

29:55.885 --> 29:59.548
Well, should I get
another bottle of wine?

29:59.617 --> 30:02.863
Sorry. Did anybody want that?

30:03.739 --> 30:05.715
So how'd you guys
hear about The Coterie?

30:05.840 --> 30:08.262
Um, actually through Gael.

30:08.326 --> 30:10.174
We're working together at Speckulate.

30:10.200 --> 30:13.207
Um, I met him when I was interviewing.

30:14.825 --> 30:16.022
No, thanks.

30:16.064 --> 30:17.330
Callie, that reminds me.

30:17.362 --> 30:19.146
You need to sign the
communal living contract

30:19.204 --> 30:22.211
and pick an activity
for community service.

30:22.500 --> 30:25.346
For example, I help a group
that rescues guinea pigs.

30:25.352 --> 30:28.151
- No, not again with the guineas.
- What about Mariana?

30:28.177 --> 30:30.850
She signed the contract
when she applied for the lease.

30:31.857 --> 30:34.704
You signed the
communal living agreement

30:34.736 --> 30:36.560
when you applied for the apartment?

30:40.199 --> 30:41.943
You knew what this place was.

30:41.967 --> 30:43.990
I knew that there were common spaces,

30:44.007 --> 30:46.169
- but I didn't...
- You lied. As usual.

30:46.208 --> 30:48.622
Okay, I didn't lie. I
omitted certain details

30:48.630 --> 30:51.005
because for $1,800 a month, this
was the best that we could do.

30:51.023 --> 30:52.588
Yeah. And you wanted to
live in the same building

30:52.612 --> 30:54.475
as your co-worker
slash future boyfriend.

30:54.523 --> 30:57.331
Okay, you know what? I can
afford my own kitchen and toilet,

30:57.348 --> 30:59.108
so I'm the one making
the sacrifices here.

30:59.130 --> 31:01.518
No one told you to
follow me to LA, Mariana.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.086
Excuse me? You did.

31:03.099 --> 31:06.071
- You invited me to be your roomie.
- Yeah. Because you can't be alone!

31:06.306 --> 31:07.348
Well, you know what?

31:07.361 --> 31:09.626
Being alone would be a lot
more fun than being with you.

31:09.647 --> 31:11.634
Because you've got a
giant stick up your ass.

31:11.660 --> 31:14.561
At least I'm not a
liar... and a stalker.

31:15.399 --> 31:17.369
I am not a stalker.

31:17.637 --> 31:19.026
And how do you know
that Gael didn't tell me

31:19.042 --> 31:21.995
- about this loft because he's into me?
- I don't want to live here.

31:23.961 --> 31:25.654
Well, I do.

31:28.511 --> 31:30.081
Then I'll get my own place.

31:30.118 --> 31:31.635
Well, good luck with that.

31:33.511 --> 31:35.925
Have fun living in a cardboard box!

32:00.455 --> 32:02.233
Hey, can we talk?

32:07.799 --> 32:10.352
So, when we...

32:11.260 --> 32:15.615
I didn't know you worked with
my sister or I never would've...

32:17.089 --> 32:20.192
I think it's better if we don't...

32:20.769 --> 32:23.402
again, and, it's definitely better

32:23.429 --> 32:25.554
if Mariana doesn't find out we did,

32:26.131 --> 32:28.519
'cause I never want a
guy to come between us.

32:42.160 --> 32:43.985
I'm a terrible person.

32:45.315 --> 32:46.949
The worst.

32:50.067 --> 32:52.513
We really can't do this again.

32:53.411 --> 32:56.001
Why would I be in between
you and your sister?

32:58.965 --> 33:00.300
'Cause Mariana...

33:01.144 --> 33:04.485
kinda has, like, a crush on you...

33:04.518 --> 33:07.973
which I didn't know and now I do...

33:08.098 --> 33:11.279
So this can't...

33:11.695 --> 33:13.511
become a thing.

33:16.128 --> 33:17.656
Sorry.

33:18.612 --> 33:20.161
And I...

33:20.286 --> 33:21.660
I get it...

33:25.924 --> 33:28.343
In this footage released
by the police department,

33:28.375 --> 33:30.042
you can see several officers in pursuit

33:30.048 --> 33:32.131
of 19-year-old Jamal Thompson

33:32.158 --> 33:34.791
who they say was involved
in a local robbery.

33:34.860 --> 33:36.441
Believing Thompson was armed,

33:36.468 --> 33:38.951
the police shot him seven times...

33:39.010 --> 33:40.605
After he made what they call

33:40.629 --> 33:42.573
"an aggressive move" towards them.

33:42.808 --> 33:46.245
It was later discovered police
mistook his cell phone for a weapon.

33:46.370 --> 33:48.320
Jamal Thompson died on the scene.

33:48.350 --> 33:51.463
My son was a good, kind, sweet soul.

33:51.522 --> 33:53.215
He had no criminal record.

33:53.340 --> 33:55.314
He had never been in
any kind of trouble.

33:55.485 --> 33:58.150
His only crime was being a black
kid in a white neighborhood.

33:58.166 --> 33:59.944
And that made him a
target for the police.

34:00.995 --> 34:02.811
When is it gonna stop?

34:03.078 --> 34:06.373
When is a young black 
or a wo gonna be able

34:06.448 --> 34:08.882
to ride in their car or...

34:09.973 --> 34:13.652
Guessing the officer wasn't charged?

34:13.710 --> 34:17.010
Are they ever? These guys are
straight up getting away with murder.

34:18.510 --> 34:20.405
It's not the same as
a criminal conviction,

34:20.427 --> 34:22.964
but at least his family can
try suing them in federal court.

34:22.998 --> 34:26.275
I read that the city's trying
to get the case dismissed.

34:26.400 --> 34:29.418
Yeah. Well, at least
we've got Judge Lawrence.

34:29.424 --> 34:31.347
First off, he's black, which is bomb.

34:31.362 --> 34:34.284
And he usually sides with
victims of police brutality.

34:34.301 --> 34:37.659
So, I feel like Jamal might
actually have a shot at justice.

34:38.696 --> 34:41.329
This is why I went to law school.

34:41.810 --> 34:43.570
Stuff like this can't happen.

34:44.465 --> 34:47.010
So why're you clerking for Judge Wilson?

34:47.040 --> 34:48.449
I looked him up.

34:48.485 --> 34:51.429
Nominated by George Bush, he's
got to be pretty far to the right.

34:51.476 --> 34:54.954
Well, I figured maybe I could
have a progressive influence

34:54.996 --> 34:56.663
on a conservative judge.

34:57.475 --> 34:59.991
You really believe you
can make a difference?

35:00.049 --> 35:01.657
I'm gonna try.

35:01.705 --> 35:04.862
Yeah. That's what we
all got to do, so...

35:12.634 --> 35:15.683
It's nice to feel like
we've got a chance for once.

35:15.748 --> 35:18.172
Justice for Jamal's family.

35:20.452 --> 35:21.950
Well, good night.

35:22.252 --> 35:23.700
Good night.

35:42.366 --> 35:44.945
Excuse me, Mr. Speck?

35:46.050 --> 35:47.429
Yes.

35:48.347 --> 35:50.222
I'm Mariana Adams Foster.

35:50.227 --> 35:51.958
I'm a new software engineer here,

35:51.984 --> 35:56.240
and... I... I don't mean to
ambush you or anything but...

35:56.262 --> 36:00.649
um, I have this idea for an app
that I would love to run by you.

36:03.070 --> 36:04.070
Okay.

36:04.990 --> 36:06.696
I'm not good with names.

36:06.733 --> 36:09.147
- I can put my info on your ph...
- No.

36:09.272 --> 36:11.353
Sorry.

36:11.390 --> 36:12.784
What's your name again?

36:12.909 --> 36:16.163
- Mariana Adams Foster.
- Mari...

36:16.361 --> 36:19.581
Marry, get married, Ana, married-Ana,

36:19.645 --> 36:21.130
marry-Ana.

36:21.205 --> 36:23.507
Adams, John Adams, second
president of the United States,

36:23.528 --> 36:25.120
Foster.

36:25.734 --> 36:29.494
- Foster...
- Foster Freeze?

36:31.438 --> 36:32.773
Got it.

36:32.827 --> 36:35.059
I'll have my assistant contact you.

36:43.279 --> 36:45.950
The first hearing will
be the motion to dismiss.

36:45.990 --> 36:50.188
- Sorry, am I late?
- No, you're just not early.

36:52.030 --> 36:53.604
We don't have much
time to get up to speed,

36:53.626 --> 36:55.767
so, I'm gonna have each of you,

36:55.772 --> 36:56.938
in addition to your other case work,

36:56.943 --> 36:59.932
write up a bench memo and tentative
order for how I should rule.

36:59.953 --> 37:03.201
- Have it on my desk by 500.
- Who's going to clerk this case?

37:03.326 --> 37:05.170
I'll decide after I read your memos.

37:05.220 --> 37:06.491
Now get to it.

37:13.585 --> 37:15.075
Hey, what's going on?

37:15.096 --> 37:16.832
Judge Lawrence had a
heart attack last night.

37:16.843 --> 37:18.712
The court's reassigning
his cases to other judges.

37:18.730 --> 37:20.844
He's going to recover,
not that Ben would care.

37:20.887 --> 37:22.909
I care, about clerking this case.

37:22.960 --> 37:25.836
- I've been here the longest.
- This is a meritocracy, my dear.

37:25.887 --> 37:29.382
- So what's the case?
- It's the Jamal Thompson police shooting case

37:29.414 --> 37:31.434
against the officers and the LAPD.

37:31.476 --> 37:33.682
In addition to excessive force,

37:33.703 --> 37:35.604
as a violation of his
constitutional rights,

37:35.642 --> 37:37.489
they're alleging that he never received

37:37.521 --> 37:39.134
prompt medical care after he was shot.

37:39.182 --> 37:41.530
Yeah, they let him lie
there bleeding for 15 minutes

37:41.532 --> 37:44.508
- before they let the EMTs in.
- Well, they thought he was armed.

37:44.529 --> 37:46.228
With a cell phone.

37:47.430 --> 37:49.149
You think Wilson will dismiss it?

37:49.202 --> 37:50.575
Based on his previous rulings,

37:50.607 --> 37:52.866
he's willing to give the benefit
of the doubt to police officers.

37:52.890 --> 37:55.560
But Wilson's never dealt
with the critical care angle.

37:55.600 --> 37:57.635
We don't know where he stands on that.

38:04.054 --> 38:06.153
Wilson doesn't have the time

38:06.201 --> 38:08.551
to wade through the
liberal opinion on this one.

38:08.562 --> 38:11.435
So just stick to the
facts and legal precedent.

38:11.478 --> 38:13.040
You don't want to get
fired from a clerkship

38:13.053 --> 38:15.792
on your second day. Or ever.

38:15.917 --> 38:17.650
It can ruin your career.

38:17.667 --> 38:18.902
So...

38:18.992 --> 38:20.765
maybe take my advice this time?

38:27.261 --> 38:29.202
- But it's actually your job.
- No, it's your job.

38:29.226 --> 38:31.753
- Then how's it not your responsibility?
- You made it.

38:32.470 --> 38:34.199
Excuse me.

38:34.819 --> 38:36.865
And I guess we're just making room.

38:36.913 --> 38:39.162
Okay. So, I found a few changes

38:39.172 --> 38:41.207
to improve latency in the code review.

38:41.332 --> 38:43.397
I'll get that back to you after lunch.

38:44.770 --> 38:47.114
You found latency issues?

38:47.239 --> 38:49.734
- In my code?
- Yes, Alex.

38:49.780 --> 38:52.137
Mainly in the big boob file.

38:52.184 --> 38:55.285
- Perhaps you were distracted.
- Yeah, so distracted.

39:05.694 --> 39:07.099
Excuse me.

39:10.746 --> 39:12.145
Who do you think you are?

39:12.567 --> 39:14.810
It's your first week,
and you've got the nerve

39:14.826 --> 39:18.975
to bother the CEO of the company
with some stupid app idea?

39:19.352 --> 39:21.744
- Well, no, I was just...
- You think you're special

39:21.777 --> 39:23.502
'cause you went to MIT?

39:23.561 --> 39:25.916
Well, everyone here went to MIT...

39:25.969 --> 39:28.190
or Stanford or Berkley.

39:28.230 --> 39:29.691
You're not special.

39:30.279 --> 39:32.159
If you pull something like that again,

39:32.196 --> 39:34.194
you're gonna be unemployed.

39:37.790 --> 39:39.210
Woo!

39:45.975 --> 39:47.786
What time does he need the report?

39:48.699 --> 39:50.334
Let me just...

40:05.726 --> 40:08.129
All right. Thank you.

40:24.885 --> 40:26.965
Hey, I can't talk right now, Mariana.

40:29.880 --> 40:31.223
Hello?

40:36.184 --> 40:38.486
- You okay?
- No.

40:38.512 --> 40:40.008
I need you.

40:40.590 --> 40:42.443
I can't leave work right now.

40:42.568 --> 40:44.280
Can we talk later?

40:45.129 --> 40:46.725
I'm sorry.

41:11.422 --> 41:13.008
Hey.

41:16.840 --> 41:18.535
It's okay.

41:21.310 --> 41:22.953
It's all right. I'm here.

41:24.600 --> 41:27.770
Why would Evan Speck tell
me he was gonna reach out

41:27.802 --> 41:29.831
and then sic HR on me?

41:30.889 --> 41:32.774
It was so humiliating.

41:33.260 --> 41:35.311
And in front of those bro-holes.

41:35.436 --> 41:38.270
I can't go back down
there and face them. I...

41:38.681 --> 41:40.331
I have to quit.

41:44.151 --> 41:46.031
I know how you feel.

41:47.505 --> 41:51.386
Judge Wilson pretty much
humiliated me on my first day.

41:52.040 --> 41:53.040
Really?

41:54.800 --> 41:56.406
Why didn't you tell me?

41:56.839 --> 41:59.968
Seemed like everything was
going really great for you.

42:01.880 --> 42:04.235
So both our jobs suck.

42:06.697 --> 42:08.100
But we can't quit.

42:09.416 --> 42:12.119
We are Adams Fosters. We don't give up.

42:12.400 --> 42:14.212
We don't give in.

42:15.019 --> 42:16.594
We fight.

42:17.994 --> 42:19.150
Right.

42:21.534 --> 42:23.345
And we have each other.

42:24.478 --> 42:25.990
We're not alone.

42:27.080 --> 42:28.413
Look,

42:28.590 --> 42:30.512
if you hate The Coterie...

42:30.902 --> 42:32.376
we can move.

42:33.040 --> 42:35.618
I don't care where we live,
as long as we're together.

42:48.729 --> 42:51.068
"Tatum versus San Francisco."

42:51.714 --> 42:54.475
So, you made the liberal argument.

42:55.153 --> 42:57.124
You're making things harder on yourself.

42:57.167 --> 42:59.741
Yeah, that's kinda my thing.

43:14.905 --> 43:17.108
I sent my review to you.

43:17.176 --> 43:19.846
And I made some adjustments
to the "Assets" folder.

43:25.347 --> 43:27.077
Let's see.

43:27.423 --> 43:29.840
- Boobies!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

43:29.906 --> 43:31.996
Aren't those your boobs, Alex?

43:32.043 --> 43:34.997
They certainly are!

43:47.035 --> 43:49.291
Callie?

43:49.416 --> 43:51.085
Judge Wilson wants to see you.

43:57.377 --> 43:58.830
You wanted to see me?

44:00.031 --> 44:03.032
You made a very passionate
argument in your bench memo.

44:07.416 --> 44:09.611
I'm not impressed by passion, Callie.

44:11.262 --> 44:13.170
Why did you take this clerkship?

44:14.524 --> 44:16.975
Because you're a highly regarded jurist

44:16.986 --> 44:19.555
and I thought I could
learn a lot from you.

44:20.990 --> 44:22.419
And maybe you thought you might have

44:22.440 --> 44:24.785
a progressive influence
on a conservative judge?

44:24.859 --> 44:27.802
I wouldn't assume that
I could influence you...

44:28.594 --> 44:32.778
but I did think that maybe you
hired me because you wanted to hear

44:32.799 --> 44:34.685
from a more left-leaning clerk.

44:34.810 --> 44:38.647
Well, let me disabuse you of one notion.

44:40.538 --> 44:42.973
I don't consider myself
a conservative judge.

44:43.149 --> 44:45.568
Because I don't believe
in judicial activism.

44:46.631 --> 44:49.130
My job is to apply the
law, not to make it,

44:49.151 --> 44:52.442
which is why I rely on precedent
and a neutral reading of the facts.

44:52.567 --> 44:55.914
I don't allow empathy
to distort my judgment.

44:56.100 --> 44:59.535
And I have no use for clerks who do.

45:21.931 --> 45:23.314
Hey.

45:23.439 --> 45:24.840
Hey!

45:24.880 --> 45:26.768
- Callie!
- Hi!

45:26.893 --> 45:28.720
Everyone donated all this furniture.

45:28.760 --> 45:29.852
Isn't it amazing?

45:29.899 --> 45:32.355
It was really Malika's idea.

45:33.672 --> 45:35.175
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

45:35.197 --> 45:37.243
I just put the word out. It's no big.

45:50.219 --> 45:51.715
So?

45:52.025 --> 45:53.846
Do you still have a job?

45:54.386 --> 45:55.918
Yes.

45:57.980 --> 46:00.725
And I'm clerking the
Jamal Thompson case.

46:03.262 --> 46:04.630
Congratulations.

46:04.670 --> 46:06.381
Let me know if you need any help.

46:09.942 --> 46:12.917
I'm sorry. I don't know
why he gave it to me.

46:12.939 --> 46:15.693
I know why. You're the counter-clerk.

46:15.818 --> 46:18.090
He hired you to make
the progressive argument

46:18.112 --> 46:19.981
so he was prepared to knock it down.

46:20.509 --> 46:23.377
Makes sense. Especially for this case.

46:24.151 --> 46:26.234
But considering your liberal politics,

46:26.245 --> 46:28.194
I'm not sure this a win for you.

46:29.326 --> 46:30.990
I'll see you tomorrow.

46:38.207 --> 46:39.639
Listen.

46:40.029 --> 46:42.859
Judge Lawrence had a
heart attack last night.

46:42.918 --> 46:47.026
He's okay, but he's off
the Jamal Thompson case.

46:47.260 --> 46:49.108
My judge has it, and

46:49.145 --> 46:51.094
I am pretty sure he's gonna dismiss it

46:51.099 --> 46:53.530
and there's nothing
I can do to stop him.

46:54.982 --> 46:56.659
I'm so sorry.

46:58.795 --> 47:01.321
Yeah. I just put the
word out. It's no big.

47:02.490 --> 47:07.051
So people donated towels
and sheets and clothes,

47:07.056 --> 47:08.903
but it looks like your work wardrobe

47:08.935 --> 47:11.830
is limited to suits.

47:11.883 --> 47:13.929
Anyway, like I said,
it was a group effort.

47:14.160 --> 47:16.017
Come on. Hop in.

47:16.263 --> 47:18.982
- It's cozy.
- I wasn't planning on it, but okay.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.217
Seriously!

47:28.713 --> 47:34.641
Come on.

47:41.640 --> 47:45.442
It's really nice of Malika
and everyone to give us stuff.

47:47.705 --> 47:49.774
Yeah, I know we said we'd move, but...

47:49.781 --> 47:52.838
besides the whole
communal bathroom thing,

47:53.425 --> 47:55.542
everyone's really nice.

47:56.343 --> 47:58.030
What do you think?

47:58.539 --> 48:00.428
Should we give it a chance?

48:04.354 --> 48:06.517
I had sex with Gael.

48:08.692 --> 48:11.877
- My Gael?
- At the time, I... I didn't know

48:11.904 --> 48:14.264
he was the guy from work
that you were crushing on.

48:15.092 --> 48:17.832
Wait, so you had sex with
him the night we moved in?

48:17.897 --> 48:20.903
I couldn't sleep, and so I
came up here to get some air

48:20.919 --> 48:22.740
and he was getting out of the pool, and

48:22.757 --> 48:25.135
you said I needed to get laid, so...

48:28.020 --> 48:29.579
I'm really sorry.

48:31.796 --> 48:34.997
- So, you really didn't know?
- I didn't.

48:36.990 --> 48:38.467
That time.

48:39.028 --> 48:40.449
There was another time?

48:40.502 --> 48:43.509
I had sex with him last night,
but I told him that's it.

48:43.634 --> 48:45.288
Okay, I swear.

49:16.289 --> 49:17.987
I forgive you.
