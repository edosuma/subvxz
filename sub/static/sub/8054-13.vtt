00:06.834 --> 00:08.101
Norquist properties,

00:08.169 --> 00:09.669
Is claimg the government screwed them

00:09.736 --> 00:12.071
By illegally seizing the land.

00:12.139 --> 00:13.939
- Well, I know about this issue.

00:14.007 --> 00:15.741
I caed the city attorney like 50 times.

00:15.808 --> 00:17.000
He didn't call me back.

00:17.067 --> 00:18.190
- Oh, do you need a lawyer?

00:18.258 --> 00:19.247
Because my friend justin's a lawyer.

00:19.315 --> 00:20.237
I'm sure he could help.

00:20.305 --> 00:21.228
- Oh, that'd be terrific.

00:21.296 --> 00:22.219
- Yeah, I'll call him.

00:22.287 --> 00:24.218
Justin's the greatest guy ever.

00:24.286 --> 00:26.642
- [chuckling] the greatest guy ever?

00:26.710 --> 00:29.457
- But does he dress... This well?

00:29.525 --> 00:30.552
Brooks brothers.

00:30.620 --> 00:32.782
Bought it right off the mannequin.

00:34.712 --> 00:37.374
- Ron swanson?

00:37.441 --> 00:38.472
- That's me.

00:38.540 --> 00:39.772
- My name is george macfayden.

00:39.839 --> 00:42.299
I wanted to talk to you about the amou of snow

00:42.367 --> 00:43.832
In the parks.

00:43.900 --> 00:46.629
- I've been getting a lot of visitors recently,

00:46.697 --> 00:51.095
Thanks to a stupid, worthless, new push

00:51.163 --> 00:53.760
To make government offials more accessible

00:53.827 --> 00:55.491
To the public.

00:55.559 --> 00:58.656
- There is a disturbing of benches in ramsett park!

00:58.724 --> 01:00.022
I want to sit more!

01:00.057 --> 01:03.420
- And another thing I like

01:03.488 --> 01:07.487
Is the layout of the hiking trails.

01:07.554 --> 01:09.653
- I made this in one of your pottery classes.

01:09.721 --> 01:12.121
It's terrible!

01:12.189 --> 01:13.987
- This is my hell.

- Leslie.

01:37.067 --> 01:38.330
Ann's friend, justin.

01:38.398 --> 01:39.864
- Oh, hey, yeah. Of course. Hi.

01:39.932 --> 01:41.331
Thank you. Thank you for coming in.

01:41.399 --> 01:42.398
- My pleasure. Not a problem.

01:42.466 --> 01:44.430
- Have a seat. - I should warn you,

01:44.498 --> 01:46.263
Land seizure isn't really my specialty,

01:46.331 --> 01:47.564
But I'm gonna have to take a look.

01:47.631 --> 01:48.998
Any friend of ann's... - Is a friend of mine.

01:49.065 --> 01:50.230
That's my motto too.

01:50.298 --> 01:51.431
- Hmm. [both chuckle]

01:51.498 --> 01:53.431
- , um, what is your specialty?

01:53.499 --> 01:55.032
Is it locking up the bad guys,

01:55.100 --> 01:57.833
Or keeping them on the streets? - Um, neither.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.699
It's civil litigation, mostly. - That's interesting.

01:59.767 --> 02:02.667
- Can be...I've got this crazy case right now.

02:02.735 --> 02:05.535
Have you ever heard of this product, fire in a can?

02:05.602 --> 02:06.735
- Oh, I love those commercials!

02:06.803 --> 02:08.235
?if you wanna start a fire ?

02:01.969 --> 02:03.402
?but you have to do it fast, then-- ?

02:03.470 --> 02:04.636
- Well, you shouldn't buy it.

02:11.038 --> 02:13.170
It will literally burn your hand clean off.

02:13.238 --> 02:14.971
- Oh, wow. - Mm-hmm.

02:15.039 --> 02:18.472
It is an aerosol can with an igniter and a trigger.

02:18.540 --> 02:20.806
It's essentially a blow torch.

02:20.874 --> 02:22.507
And, if you can believe it,

02:22.574 --> 02:25.608
It was invented to warm up baby bottles.

02:25.676 --> 02:27.809
- This is my colleague, tom haverford.

02:27.877 --> 02:29.543
- Tom, justin. - How are you?

02:29.611 --> 02:31.811
You are wearing the hell out of that suit, sir.

02:31.878 --> 02:33.243
Banana two-button.

02:33.311 --> 02:34.244
- Okay, let's go into the conference room.

02:34.312 --> 02:35.244
I got everything laid out.

02:35.312 --> 02:36.645
- We should talk later. - Tom, stop.

02:37.947 --> 02:40.781
- Wow, 12:15. You're early today.

02:40.848 --> 02:42.949
- April, there's no paper in the printer.

02:43.017 --> 02:44.517
- So?

02:44.585 --> 02:46.652
- So that's the one thing you do.

02:46.719 --> 02:48.186
- [sighs]

02:51.155 --> 02:53.055
- Attention.

02:53.123 --> 02:54.488
April, stop doing that.

02:54.556 --> 02:56.989
- Jerry told me to, so it's super-crucial.

02:57.057 --> 02:58.423
- More important than that,

02:58.491 --> 03:01.825
And more important than anything in this god-forsaken world

03:01.893 --> 03:03.192
Is finding me an assistant.

03:03.260 --> 03:05.294
- You get an assistant now?

03:05.361 --> 03:06.761
- Yeah, I've always been able to have one,

03:06.829 --> 03:08.529
But ve turned it down cause it's a waste of money.

03:08.597 --> 03:10.063
In the eight years I've been at the job,

03:10.131 --> 03:11.631
I've saved the taxpayers of this city

03:11.698 --> 03:13.498
More than 150 grand.

03:13.566 --> 03:16.533
But now, I need the taxpayers' money

03:16.601 --> 03:18.567
To save me from the taxpayers.

03:18.635 --> 03:22.069
Post this at your college.

03:23.471 --> 03:25.838
- This looks like an ad for nothing.

03:25.906 --> 03:26.906
- Please be careful with it.

03:26.973 --> 03:29.073
It's my only copy.

03:29.141 --> 03:31.041
- You are very organized, leslie.

03:31.109 --> 03:32.642
- Yeah, I am.

03:32.710 --> 03:33.943
Thank you.

03:34.011 --> 03:35.844
- I love what you do. You got the coolest job.

03:35.912 --> 03:37.845
Let me guess. This is our park.

03:37.913 --> 03:39.512
I want to know everything about this.

03:39.580 --> 03:40.880
- Oh, okay.

03:40.947 --> 03:42.747
Well, these green things represent trees.

03:42.815 --> 03:45.249
- I come in, like, two hours late

03:45.317 --> 03:46.917
Because I had to finish watching <i>swimfan</i>

03:46.985 --> 03:48.851
Because it was...On.

03:48.919 --> 03:50.953
And everyone, like, jumped down my throat.

03:51.020 --> 03:52.220
- Oh, man.

03:52.288 --> 03:53.888
- Can't wait till my internship is over,

03:53.956 --> 03:55.489
So I can get the hell out of here.

03:55.556 --> 03:58.324
- Well, you're all set.

03:58.391 --> 04:00.692
Free of charge, of course.

04:00.760 --> 04:03.427
- Hey, why don't you sell your band's cds here?

04:03.495 --> 04:05.128
- That is a brilliant idea.

04:05.196 --> 04:07.329
I cannot believe I didn't think of that.

04:07.397 --> 04:09.230
I have been writing a lot of songs

04:09.298 --> 04:11.465
About shining shoes lately.

04:11.533 --> 04:13.900
I tend to write about what I'm doing.

04:13.968 --> 04:16.002

 117 00:04:09,735 --> 00:04:13,671 â™?writin' about what I'm doin' â™?

04:30.117 --> 04:32.318
- Thank you so much. I know you're really busy.

04:32.386 --> 04:33.486
- Please, it's my pleasure.

04:33.553 --> 04:36.088
Least this stuff is interesting, you know.

04:36.156 --> 04:37.456
You know, it actually reminds me--

04:37.524 --> 04:40.459
Two years ago I was in borneo, officiating a wedding,

04:40.527 --> 04:42.962
And this enormous medicine man showed up,

04:43.029 --> 04:45.097
And he was there to basically tell--

04:45.165 --> 04:46.566
- Justin! - Hey, kiddo.

04:46.633 --> 04:48.200
- Hey. - How you doin'?

04:48.268 --> 04:49.868
- I'm good. I haven't seen you in forever.

04:49.936 --> 04:51.303
- I know, so good to see you.

04:51.371 --> 04:52.471
- You too. Do you want to grab some dinner?

04:52.538 --> 04:54.006
- Uh, I would love to.

04:54.073 --> 04:55.741
I cannot. I am swamped.

04:55.808 --> 04:56.808
- You're always so busy.

04:56.876 --> 04:58.510
- Yeah. Next week, I promise.

04:58.578 --> 05:00.112
- Okay. - Hey, I'm mark.

05:00.180 --> 05:02.748
- Oh! Sorry. Justin, this is mark.

05:02.816 --> 05:04.784
This is the city planner. - Oh, my god.

05:04.852 --> 05:06.118
It's such a pleasure to meet you.

05:06.186 --> 05:07.787
- Uh, pleasure. - Pleasure.

05:09.656 --> 05:11.289
Anyway, leslie, I have to go.

05:11.357 --> 05:13.091
It has been a super pleasure meeting you.

05:13.158 --> 05:14.425
I am gonna get into this over the weekend,

05:14.493 --> 05:16.626
And I will get back to you on Monday about it.

05:16.694 --> 05:17.894
- Okay, great. - All right.

05:17.961 --> 05:19.761
- See you, justin. - Hey, tom, good seeing you.

05:19.828 --> 05:21.161
- I've been thinking.

05:21.229 --> 05:24.063
It has been a while since dave left.

05:24.130 --> 05:26.097
And I think I might be ready to start dating again.

05:26.165 --> 05:27.833
- That's great! Oh, my god.

05:27.901 --> 05:29.133
I have so many ideas.

05:29.201 --> 05:31.301
- You know, I was only with mark for one night,

05:31.369 --> 05:33.904
And then I was hung up on him for six years.

05:33.972 --> 05:36.006
I dated dave for three months.

05:36.074 --> 05:37.908
So if I continue that pattern,

05:37.976 --> 05:41.378
I won't be over him for...

05:41.445 --> 05:43.780
500 years.

05:43.848 --> 05:45.181
- What is your ideal man?

05:45.249 --> 05:47.317
- He has the brains of george clooney

05:47.385 --> 05:49.119
In the body of joe biden.

05:49.186 --> 05:51.154
- Interesting.

05:51.222 --> 05:52.756
Okay, just off the bat,

05:52.823 --> 05:55.024
There is a couple of doctors I think you would love.

05:55.092 --> 05:56.793
- What about justin?

05:56.860 --> 05:59.195
- I mean, I feel like we kind of hit it off in there.

05:59.263 --> 06:00.697
- Yeah, I don't...

06:00.764 --> 06:02.031
I have to think about that.

06:02.099 --> 06:03.700
I don't--I'm not sure that would work.

06:03.767 --> 06:05.101
- Really? Is there something wrong with him?

06:05.169 --> 06:07.170
- No, no, he's really, really, really great.

06:07.237 --> 06:08.838
And you're so great, obviously.

06:08.906 --> 06:10.973
I just do--I don't-- I don't know.

06:11.041 --> 06:12.408
But I will find you soone. I promise.

06:12.476 --> 06:13.476
And he'll be awesome.

06:13.544 --> 06:15.044
I'm gonna go do it right now.

06:15.112 --> 06:16.279
- Good, great. Yes!

06:16.346 --> 06:18.548
Go, ann, go! Oh, just one rule.

06:18.616 --> 06:19.849
I don't want to date a twin.

06:19.917 --> 06:22.352
'cause I've been tricked before.

06:22.419 --> 06:23.720
- Okay.

06:23.787 --> 06:27.156
- Yes, I understand your complaint.

06:27.224 --> 06:28.958
I have to go now.

06:29.026 --> 06:31.294
Plse. Thank you.

06:31.362 --> 06:33.364
- Ron solo. - Hello, tom.

06:33.431 --> 06:35.332
- I want to help you with your assistant search.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.600
- Why?

06:36.668 --> 06:37.767
- 'cause I wan to do my boy ron a solid.

06:37.835 --> 06:38.902
I know exactly what you're looking for,

06:38.969 --> 06:40.636
And I will find you a reliable person.

06:40.704 --> 06:45.073
[phone ringing]

06:49.111 --> 06:51.345
- Now, get out there and find me an assistant.

06:51.413 --> 06:53.147
- Okay.

06:53.215 --> 06:54.315
- I left you three messages. Did you get them?

06:54.383 --> 06:55.483
- No, I been running around all day.

06:55.551 --> 06:56.718
What's up?

06:56.786 --> 06:58.553
- I found the perfect guy to set you up with.

06:58.621 --> 07:00.588
But he's going out of town, so he can only do tonight.

07:00.656 --> 07:03.024
So I came over here right after work.

07:03.092 --> 07:04.559
- Is that his blood? - What?

07:04.627 --> 07:06.695
Oh, damn. Now I have to go back.

07:06.762 --> 07:08.496
- Who is he? - His name is chris,

07:08.563 --> 07:10.163
And he's an mri technician.

07:10.231 --> 07:12.031
And he's really cute and he's very passionate about his job.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.500
And I told him all about you and he's really interested.

07:14.568 --> 07:17.436
So dinner tonight, and here's the info.

07:17.504 --> 07:19.538
- Thanks. Wait!

07:19.605 --> 07:20.872
How is he gonna know it's me?

07:20.940 --> 07:22.807
I'll wear a red rose in my hair.

07:22.875 --> 07:24.341
No, I'll wear a giant, red hat.

07:24.409 --> 07:25.776
No, I don't have one of those. What should I wear?

07:25.844 --> 07:27.010
It's gotta be red.

07:27.078 --> 07:28.778
- I will just tell him what you look like.

07:28.846 --> 07:29.879
- Good call.

07:29.947 --> 07:30.947
[light piano music]

07:31.015 --> 07:32.314
- Hi, I'm leslie.

07:32.382 --> 07:33.682
Are you chris? - Yeah.

07:33.750 --> 07:36.485
- Sorry I'm late. - Oh, don't worry about it.

07:36.553 --> 07:39.020
You look beautiful. - Thank you.

07:39.088 --> 07:40.055
- Oh, here, let take your coat.

07:40.122 --> 07:41.890
- Oh, thanks. - Sure.

07:41.957 --> 07:44.558
- [whispering] well done, ann.

07:44.626 --> 07:46.293
- I actually heard that. - What?

07:47.760 --> 07:49.620
- Well, I went to wisconsin for both undergrad

07:49.620 --> 07:50.820
And grad school.

07:51.287 --> 07:53.922
Go, badgers. - Boo. Indiana hoosiers.

07:53.990 --> 07:55.891
- <i>No,</i> badgers.

07:55.959 --> 07:57.526
- Oh.

07:57.594 --> 07:58.727
It's not important.

07:58.794 --> 08:01.996
I'm just glad that we could make this happen.

08:02.064 --> 08:03.698
- Ann kept going on about how wonderful you are,

08:03.766 --> 08:06.101
And I just had to see for myself.

08:06.168 --> 08:07.769
- Well, she's my number one best friend.

08:07.836 --> 08:09.204
- Kind of wish she'd told me that you went to indiana,

08:09.271 --> 08:10.805
But whatever.

08:10.873 --> 08:12.840
So you're in charge of amusement parks, right?

08:12.908 --> 08:14.241
God, that's exciting.

08:14.309 --> 08:16.310
- Actually, it's regular parks.

08:16.378 --> 08:18.012
Like swings and slides and stuff.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.514
- Strike two.

08:21.351 --> 08:22.851
- You know, isn't it funny

08:22.919 --> 08:25.388
How these setups are always just so awkward?

08:25.455 --> 08:27.891
[both laugh]

08:27.958 --> 08:30.093
- Hey, watch this.

08:30.161 --> 08:32.395
I will now extinguish this candle

08:32.464 --> 08:33.563
With my bare hands.

08:33.631 --> 08:36.768
- Okay.

08:36.835 --> 08:39.538
- Gah, [bleep]! Uhh!

08:39.605 --> 08:41.472
That really hurts. - Are you okay?

08:41.539 --> 08:44.173
- Oh, god, it looks so much easier on the internet.

08:44.241 --> 08:46.241
God, I gotta borrow some of your ice.

08:46.309 --> 08:48.142
[exhales]

08:48.210 --> 08:49.210
- German?

08:49.278 --> 08:51.746
[laughing] oh, my god.

08:51.814 --> 08:53.647
All right, later.

08:53.715 --> 08:54.815
- Ah.

08:54.883 --> 08:57.117
Was that, um, justin?

08:57.185 --> 08:59.685
- Yes. We are going to lunch tomorrow.

08:59.752 --> 09:00.952
- Oh, great.

09:01.019 --> 09:02.920
Did you guys ever date?

09:02.987 --> 09:04.484
- No, we never did.

09:04.552 --> 09:05.851
He's just like...

09:05.919 --> 09:06.951
A really amazing person.

09:07.019 --> 09:08.951
- Awesome.

09:09.019 --> 09:10.820
- Let's do this! <i>Marley & me.</i>

09:10.888 --> 09:12.789
Puppies! Puppies, puppies.

09:12.856 --> 09:13.856
- [laughing] I know.

09:13.924 --> 09:17.258
Let's...Watch <i>marley & me.</i>

09:19.160 --> 09:21.992
- Brian.

09:22.059 --> 09:23.726
Technically, you'd be assisting ron.

09:23.793 --> 09:25.827
But ron really doesn't do much government work,

09:25.895 --> 09:27.662
So you'd really be working for me.

09:27.730 --> 09:30.097
I'm interested in real world expertise.

09:30.165 --> 09:32.833
I got a nightclub opening to go to.

09:32.901 --> 09:34.634
Which tie do I wear?

09:34.702 --> 09:36.069
- I like the one on the left.

09:36.137 --> 09:38.405
- That was a trick question.

09:38.472 --> 09:40.306
The answer is this one.

09:40.374 --> 09:43.143
Tell me about you. Tell me about your friends.

09:43.210 --> 09:45.444
Be as superficial as possible.

09:45.512 --> 09:46.679
I meet a girl at a bar.

09:46.746 --> 09:48.747
She seems kind of into me. Could go either way.

09:48.815 --> 09:50.315
I get her number. It's two days later.

09:50.383 --> 09:51.783
What do I text her?

09:51.851 --> 09:53.117
- It was nice meeting you?

09:53.185 --> 09:54.418
- No, zack!

09:54.486 --> 09:55.786
I don't text her, "it was nice meeting you."

09:55.854 --> 09:57.254
I wait eight weeks,

09:57.321 --> 09:59.355
And I text her, "what's crackin'?"

09:59.422 --> 10:01.957
- So do you enjoy it?

10:02.024 --> 10:03.491
Being an mri technician?

10:03.559 --> 10:04.726
- Great question.

10:04.793 --> 10:06.661
Someone steps into the room.

10:06.728 --> 10:09.697
Imagine a mother of three. Maybe she's a teacher.

10:09.764 --> 10:12.766
She knows something's wrong, but she doesn't know what it is.

10:12.834 --> 10:14.367
She's scared.

10:14.435 --> 10:16.969
In less than an hour, I know what it is.

10:17.037 --> 10:18.004
- What's wrong with her?

10:18.071 --> 10:20.339
- I don't know.

10:20.406 --> 10:23.007
But the best part about being an mri technician is...

10:23.075 --> 10:25.342
I can see inside everything.

10:25.410 --> 10:26.977
See that guy over there?

10:27.044 --> 10:30.347
Imagine being able to look inside his head.

10:30.414 --> 10:31.814
- Wow. - I know.

10:31.882 --> 10:35.051
Could look inside the steak or this butter or this bread.

10:35.118 --> 10:37.987
You can look inside anything.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.488
- Well, if you look inside this bread,

10:39.555 --> 10:40.889
All you're gonna find is more bread.

10:40.957 --> 10:43.658
- I don't know. I'd have to do an mri.

10:43.725 --> 10:46.026
- Anyway, it's good that you found your calling.

10:46.094 --> 10:48.428
I mean, I've never even had an mri before.

10:48.495 --> 10:50.362
[sets down fork] - what?

10:52.498 --> 10:54.533
- I don't know about this.

10:54.601 --> 10:57.337
- Well, I'm offering you a free scan.

10:57.404 --> 10:59.472
Usually costs up to $2,000.

10:59.540 --> 11:01.273
I'm kind of spoiling you here.

11:01.341 --> 11:04.409
- Well, I am a little curious.

11:04.476 --> 11:05.910
- Good.

11:05.978 --> 11:07.245
'cause, frankly, I don't want to invest in someone

11:07.313 --> 11:08.546
Who only has three months to live.

11:08.614 --> 11:11.615
- [laughs]

11:11.683 --> 11:13.083
Oh.

11:13.151 --> 11:14.251
I'm just trying to think of this as an adventure.

11:14.318 --> 11:15.318
You know?

11:15.386 --> 11:18.221
Just getting right back on that horse.

11:18.289 --> 11:19.789
Even if that horse is crazy

11:19.857 --> 11:22.525
And want to peer inside my body.

11:22.593 --> 11:23.592
[snap]

11:23.660 --> 11:24.727
How does that feel?

11:24.794 --> 11:25.894
- Uh, weird.

11:25.962 --> 11:27.029
- Perfect.

11:27.096 --> 11:29.765
Oh, you're not on your period, are you?

11:29.833 --> 11:31.234
- No. Does that matter?

11:31.302 --> 11:33.670
- Well, not for this.

11:33.738 --> 11:36.340
Okay, it's gonna be a little cramped in there.

11:36.408 --> 11:38.576
Don't worry, I'll be right on the other side of that glass.

11:38.644 --> 11:40.178
[machine whirring]

11:40.246 --> 11:41.880
- Just your basic assistant stuff.

11:41.948 --> 11:43.580
Taking messages, wakeup calls.

11:43.648 --> 11:46.048
Muscle milk runs, condom runs,

11:46.115 --> 11:47.582
Bottle service to the snakehole lounge.

11:47.650 --> 11:48.883
That kind of stuff.

11:48.951 --> 11:49.951
- Sorry, what do I get out of this?

11:50.018 --> 11:52.286
- Connections. Plus 19 grand a year.

11:52.353 --> 11:55.254
Minus my 10% headhunter's fee.

11:55.322 --> 11:57.155
- I have to pay you two grand if I get hired?

11:57.223 --> 11:58.523
- I have a job to offer.

11:58.591 --> 12:00.891
In the immortal words of rob blagojevich,

12:00.959 --> 12:02.659
It's a [bleep] valuable thing.

12:02.727 --> 12:04.460
You just don't give it away for nothing.

12:04.528 --> 12:07.095
- So you never told me where you're from.

12:07.163 --> 12:09.864
- I'm from pawnee. - Keep still, please.

12:09.932 --> 12:11.265
What kind of music do you like?

12:11.332 --> 12:12.699
- Can I answer that?

12:12.767 --> 12:14.033
- Sure. Keep still.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.734
- All kinds.

12:15.802 --> 12:16.968
- It's very important

12:17.036 --> 12:19.203
That you keep still at this moment, leslie.

12:19.271 --> 12:20.938
I've told you that 1,000 times.

12:21.006 --> 12:21.972
- [grunts]

12:22.040 --> 12:24.040
- Did you ever break your arm?

12:24.107 --> 12:26.308
You can answer that. Here, I'll turn it off.

12:26.375 --> 12:27.708
- One time, I was on my bike,

12:27.776 --> 12:28.909
And some boys were making fun of me.

12:28.977 --> 12:30.944
So I chased them and I lost control.

12:31.012 --> 12:33.245
I'm surprised you can see that.

12:33.313 --> 12:34.813
It was like three years ago.

12:34.881 --> 12:37.815
- I can't believe I turned the machine off for that.

12:37.883 --> 12:40.551
You never had any kids, right, leslie?

12:40.618 --> 12:42.653
- No. - You should.

12:42.721 --> 12:44.288
You've got a great oven.

12:44.356 --> 12:45.590
- Okay...Time to go.

12:45.658 --> 12:47.325
- You've got ample room in there.

12:47.393 --> 12:49.427
Honestly, if you wanted to,

12:49.495 --> 12:52.296
You could go triplets right off the bat, leslie.

12:52.364 --> 12:55.599
You got a big, industrial-sized oven.

12:55.666 --> 12:57.134
- So we're done, right?

12:57.201 --> 13:00.672
[phone ringing]

13:00.740 --> 13:02.642
- Hey, how's the date going?

13:02.710 --> 13:05.114
- Good. We just finished the mri.

13:05.182 --> 13:06.516
- What?

13:06.584 --> 13:07.851
- Look, I know I said that I wanted to get back out there,

13:07.919 --> 13:09.318
But this guy is nuts.

13:09.386 --> 13:10.419
- I'm sorry, les.

13:10.487 --> 13:12.221
I'll find you somebody else, okay?

13:12.288 --> 13:13.955
Just don't let this sour you on dating.

13:14.023 --> 13:15.490
Yeah, okay.

13:15.558 --> 13:17.827
- Hey, no cell phones!

13:17.894 --> 13:20.166
[phone beeps off] - what was that about?

13:20.234 --> 13:21.835
- I set leslie up on a date.

13:21.903 --> 13:23.670
I don't think it's going that well.

13:23.738 --> 13:25.939
- Oh, no. With, uh, with justin?

13:26.007 --> 13:28.375
- Oh, no, this guy I know from the hospital.

13:28.443 --> 13:30.310
- Why not justin?

13:30.378 --> 13:32.679
- I don't really see them together.

13:32.747 --> 13:33.880
You know?

13:33.948 --> 13:35.549
Plus, leslie just got out of a relationship,

13:35.616 --> 13:38.118
So I didn't want justin to be like her rebound guy

13:38.185 --> 13:39.819
Or anything, you know?

13:39.887 --> 13:41.187
- Yeah, that makes sense.

13:41.255 --> 13:43.990
Leslie is a notoriously cruel and thoughtless person.

13:44.058 --> 13:45.058
- Why are we talking about this?

13:45.125 --> 13:46.059
- We're not.

13:46.126 --> 13:47.327
[dog barks on tv]

13:47.394 --> 13:49.796
- You got a large brain.

13:49.864 --> 13:51.131
- Thank you.

13:51.198 --> 13:53.066
- Yeah. No, it looks pretty...

13:53.133 --> 13:55.802
Hang on.

13:55.869 --> 13:56.836
That's weird.

13:56.904 --> 13:58.071
- What? What's weird?

13:58.138 --> 13:59.572
- Your brain.

13:59.640 --> 14:01.139
You see that shadow right there?

14:01.207 --> 14:02.274
- What--is that bad?

14:02.341 --> 14:03.708
- I don't know, I'd have a doctor

14:03.776 --> 14:05.643
Look at that immediately, if I were you.

14:05.711 --> 14:07.913
- Are you serious?

14:07.980 --> 14:11.216
- Oh, wait.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.384
Oh.

14:12.452 --> 14:15.619
It was like a smudge or something.

14:15.686 --> 14:17.452
Crazy. [chuckles]

14:17.520 --> 14:18.686
Thank god I was here.

14:18.754 --> 14:19.988
- Mark, I've never gone out with him!

14:20.055 --> 14:21.322
I swear!

14:21.390 --> 14:22.623
- I'm sorry, but there's just something weird

14:22.691 --> 14:24.257
About the way you talk about him.

14:24.325 --> 14:26.326
- I don't know, I mean, there was definitely times

14:26.393 --> 14:29.328
When we thought maybe we would go out someday, but--

14:29.396 --> 14:30.596
- That's why you didn't set leslie up,

14:30.664 --> 14:31.830
Because you're saving him.

14:31.898 --> 14:32.831
- No, I'm not.

14:32.899 --> 14:34.399
- Oh, yeah, you are.

14:34.467 --> 14:36.668
- Okay, fine, you don't have someone in your life

14:36.736 --> 14:38.403
That you think, "I don't know,

14:38.470 --> 14:40.938
Maybe if things were different, maybe someday--"

14:41.006 --> 14:42.039
- You know what?

14:42.106 --> 14:43.407
You can't save somebody for the future

14:43.474 --> 14:44.908
While you're in a relationship.

14:44.976 --> 14:46.109
Even I know that.

14:46.177 --> 14:47.477
- Come on, don't go.

14:47.545 --> 14:48.745
- I'll talk to you later.

14:48.813 --> 14:50.613
And, by the way,

14:50.681 --> 14:53.582
The dog dies at the end.

14:53.650 --> 14:55.516
- So did you want to go back to your place or--

14:55.584 --> 14:57.751
- Actually, chris, it was nice to meet you,

14:57.819 --> 14:59.887
But I think this is gonna be our last date.

14:59.955 --> 15:01.588
- I get it.

15:01.656 --> 15:04.058
You get your mri and get out, huh?

15:04.125 --> 15:05.292
- This was your idea.

15:05.360 --> 15:06.727
- Clever lady.

15:06.794 --> 15:09.296
Guess I'm not as good a tech as I thought I was.

15:09.363 --> 15:11.264
Should have noticed that you're missing a heart.

15:11.332 --> 15:12.632
- Ew.

15:12.700 --> 15:14.468
- Good-bye, leslie.

15:18.673 --> 15:20.207
- Right.

15:20.274 --> 15:21.541
I drove us here.

15:21.609 --> 15:22.809
Goody.

15:22.877 --> 15:24.477
- Do you mind if we pick up my son nate

15:24.545 --> 15:26.680
At his basketball game on the way back?

15:29.971 --> 15:31.005
- Wow, this is really good.

15:31.602 --> 15:33.436
"cease and desist; burden of proof"?

15:33.503 --> 15:34.836
- Check out paragraph two,

15:34.904 --> 15:36.104
Where I dropped the f-bomb.

15:36.920 --> 15:38.854
- "frivolous."

15:38.922 --> 15:40.780
- Definitely have the city attorney look at that.

15:40.980 --> 15:42.981
But that should be enough to do the trick.

15:43.048 --> 15:45.516
- Well, justin, I just-- I can't thank you enough.

15:45.584 --> 15:46.584
- It's my pleasure.

15:46.651 --> 15:48.318
Maybe I will see you around sometime.

15:48.386 --> 15:49.719
- Yeah, I...

15:49.787 --> 15:51.388
I would li--would lo-- mm-hmm.

15:51.455 --> 15:53.189
- I'll see you. - Okay.

15:53.257 --> 15:54.590
- Bye. - Bye!

15:57.760 --> 16:01.529
- Damn, he is all right.

16:01.597 --> 16:04.031
Why don't you hit that?

16:04.099 --> 16:07.366
- Well, frankly, I would like to hit that.

16:07.434 --> 16:10.536
But ann's being a little weird about it.

16:10.604 --> 16:11.903
- When you were dating ann,

16:11.971 --> 16:13.771
Did you know this guy justin?

16:13.839 --> 16:15.172
- Uck! Justin?

16:15.240 --> 16:16.540
I hate justin.

16:16.607 --> 16:18.576
Ann was so obviously into him. It was so annoying.

16:18.643 --> 16:20.011
- Right.

16:20.078 --> 16:21.579
- I would say, in terms of guys that she's in love with,

16:21.646 --> 16:22.679
Justin's up here.

16:22.747 --> 16:24.881
- I'm up here,

16:24.949 --> 16:26.349
And then you're down here.

16:26.416 --> 16:29.051
- Well, I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't crazy.

16:29.119 --> 16:32.722
So naturally, I came to you for reassurance.

16:32.789 --> 16:33.956
Do me a favor--

16:34.024 --> 16:36.192
Don't tell ann that we talked about this.

16:36.260 --> 16:37.693
- Will do.

16:37.761 --> 16:38.794
Ann perkins,

16:38.862 --> 16:41.298
You should be ashamed of yourself.

16:41.366 --> 16:43.033
What you're doing to mark is not cool.

16:43.101 --> 16:44.935
- Why are you guys talking to each other?

16:45.002 --> 16:46.136
You know what? Forget it.

16:46.204 --> 16:47.570
I'm not getting into this with you.

16:47.638 --> 16:48.938
- You did something wrong? - No!

16:49.006 --> 16:51.240
- Yeah. - I didn't do anything wrong!

16:51.308 --> 16:54.077
Come here. This is none of your business.

16:54.144 --> 16:55.311
You don't know what you're talking about.

16:55.379 --> 16:57.480
- Actually, I do know what I'm talking about.

16:57.548 --> 16:59.916
Every time I used to sit around all afternoon

16:59.984 --> 17:01.985
Playing video games, wearing only my slippers,

17:02.053 --> 17:04.721
All of a sudden, I would start to feel bad about myself.

17:04.788 --> 17:06.489
And do you know why?

17:06.557 --> 17:07.958
- Didn't you just explain why?

17:08.025 --> 17:09.958
- I would feel bad about myself

17:10.026 --> 17:12.493
Because I would start to think about this perfect guy.

17:12.561 --> 17:14.563
Any time you would talk about justin,

17:14.631 --> 17:16.932
I didn't feel very important.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.467
That was rough.

17:18.535 --> 17:20.336
- Well, I didn't know that.

17:20.404 --> 17:22.305
- Maybe if you had, I wouldn't have left.

17:22.372 --> 17:25.708
But you do know now, so you have to choose.

17:25.776 --> 17:27.242
It's either me or justin.

17:27.310 --> 17:28.711
- I'm not gonna choose.

17:28.779 --> 17:30.113
Wait, I'm dating mark!

17:30.181 --> 17:31.181
- Are you, though? - Yes!

17:31.248 --> 17:32.949
- Ah! That close.

17:33.017 --> 17:34.517
- Ronald...

17:34.585 --> 17:35.784
I've done it.

17:35.852 --> 17:38.319
I found your assistant, and he's dope.

17:38.387 --> 17:40.454
His name is jean-ralphio.

17:40.521 --> 17:41.487
Jean-ralphio!

17:41.555 --> 17:43.156
- Big "t."

17:43.223 --> 17:44.891
Mr. Swanson, two things.

17:44.958 --> 17:48.194
One, it is an absolute honor to meet you.

17:48.262 --> 17:50.396
Two, who is that hot intern chick out there?

17:50.464 --> 17:54.100
Because, honestly, daaaamn!

17:54.167 --> 17:55.968
[both laughing] - uh, take a seat.

17:56.036 --> 17:57.403
- Right here. - Here we go.

17:57.471 --> 17:59.305
- So, jean-ralphio...

17:59.373 --> 18:00.440
- You got him right here.

18:00.508 --> 18:01.908
Leave a message after the beep.

18:01.975 --> 18:04.276
- Why do I want you as my assistant?

18:04.343 --> 18:06.945
- For starters, access to the illest clubs.

18:07.012 --> 18:08.246
And that's just for starters.

18:08.314 --> 18:10.582
I will work for you. I will be on you, 24/7.

18:10.650 --> 18:11.816
I'll be like your family.

18:11.884 --> 18:13.350
I'm here when you get here in the morning.

18:13.418 --> 18:14.984
Sure enough, I'll be there tucking you into bed at night.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.920
Don't worry, it's not gay. Do we have questions?

18:18.989 --> 18:20.956
- I think our only question is when can you start?

18:21.024 --> 18:22.325
- Right now. Let's do it.

18:22.393 --> 18:24.626
- Thank you for coming in.

18:24.694 --> 18:25.994
We will talk.

18:26.062 --> 18:27.863
- Cool. I feel good about this.

18:27.930 --> 18:29.798
Hey, you know, you can hit me up on facebook any time,

18:29.866 --> 18:30.966
Day or night-- you know that, right?

18:31.034 --> 18:33.067
- Take care, buddy. - Boom.

18:33.135 --> 18:35.236
- So what do you think of your new assistant?

18:35.304 --> 18:38.273
- I wanna punch you in the face so bad right now.

18:38.340 --> 18:39.941
- What?

18:40.009 --> 18:41.576
Okay.

18:41.644 --> 18:43.444
Message received. I'll keep looking.

18:43.512 --> 18:44.579
- Thank you.

18:44.647 --> 18:46.547
Bring me the opposite of him.

18:46.615 --> 18:48.349
[rock music playing]

18:48.417 --> 18:49.450
- What kind of music is this?

18:49.518 --> 18:51.252
- It's rock and roll, my friend.

18:51.320 --> 18:54.322
Fast, smooth, handsome rock.

18:54.389 --> 18:56.223
- That band is really blowing up right now.

18:56.291 --> 18:58.025
They're number one on itunes.

18:58.093 --> 18:59.793
- Okay, I'll take one.

19:03.731 --> 19:04.965
- There's your change.

19:06.935 --> 19:08.770
You are amazing.

19:08.838 --> 19:11.473
I like when you hang out here.

19:13.875 --> 19:15.375
- I want to be your assistant.

19:15.443 --> 19:16.676
- Really?

19:16.744 --> 19:17.944
You hate it here.

19:18.012 --> 19:19.880
- So do you.

19:19.948 --> 19:22.017
I'll make sure you don't have to go to any meetings.

19:22.085 --> 19:23.885
If anyone comes to see you,

19:23.953 --> 19:24.919
I'll scare them away.

19:24.987 --> 19:26.254
- Wait, April.

19:26.321 --> 19:28.022
If you had to choose between these two ties...

19:30.158 --> 19:31.091
- You're hired.

19:31.158 --> 19:33.228
- I just figured

19:33.295 --> 19:35.997
I might as well get paid for being here.

19:37.599 --> 19:39.934
- Hi. - Hey, I was just calling you.

19:40.002 --> 19:42.036
- Here.

19:43.973 --> 19:45.706
- This is a prescription for denise dogan.

19:45.774 --> 19:47.875
- Oh, my god, I'm sorry.

19:47.943 --> 19:50.411
I'm so out of sorts.

19:50.479 --> 19:52.047
Here.

19:52.114 --> 19:53.514
- Porter's grill at 7:00.

19:53.582 --> 19:54.749
- Justin's gonna meet you there.

19:54.817 --> 19:57.251
I'm sorry chris was such a jerk.

19:57.319 --> 19:58.820
You deserve way better than that.

19:58.888 --> 20:00.956
- If this situation is weird, or if you feel weird--

20:01.024 --> 20:02.257
- It's not weird.

20:02.325 --> 20:03.725
You guys will really like each other.

20:03.793 --> 20:05.328
- Thanks. - I gotta run.

20:05.396 --> 20:06.830
I have another stop on the pride-swallowing tour

20:06.898 --> 20:07.931
Of city hall.

20:07.999 --> 20:09.066
- Go get 'em.

20:09.134 --> 20:10.767
- That's where I never find things.

20:10.835 --> 20:11.968
- Hey.

20:12.036 --> 20:13.303
- Hi, ann.

20:13.370 --> 20:16.904
- So I just set up justin and leslie.

20:16.972 --> 20:18.837
And I'm sorry.

20:18.905 --> 20:21.872
I rented <i>district 9</i>

20:21.940 --> 20:25.175
If you maybe wanted to spoil that for me tonight.

20:27.478 --> 20:29.412
- [whispering]

20:29.480 --> 20:30.480
- Oh, my god!

20:30.548 --> 20:32.015
- Dark ending, right.

20:35.052 --> 20:36.519
- I'm back on the horse.

20:36.587 --> 20:38.821
And this horse is a lawyer,

20:38.889 --> 20:42.892
So I'm looking forward to riding him.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.126
No, wait.

20:45.315 --> 20:47.479
- Ten months ago, she was an intern

20:47.479 --> 20:50.147
Who could give a c-r-a-p about local government.

20:50.215 --> 20:52.516
Now, she's our newest employee.

20:52.583 --> 20:53.684
To April.

20:53.751 --> 20:54.884
All: Cheers!

20:54.952 --> 20:56.052
- [weakly] yay.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.987
- Jerry, come and celebrate.

20:58.054 --> 20:59.121
- No, thanks.

20:59.189 --> 21:00.222
- Well, everybody,

21:00.289 --> 21:01.589
Let's get back to work.

21:04.993 --> 21:06.259
- Where are you going?

21:06.327 --> 21:09.229
- I want to talk to ron about the size of my desk.

21:09.297 --> 21:10.263
- Jerry...

21:10.331 --> 21:12.765
You have to schedule an appointment.

21:12.833 --> 21:14.533
- Okay, how about now?

21:14.601 --> 21:16.301
- Ron's not here. - He's right there.

21:16.369 --> 21:17.835
I-I can see him.

21:17.903 --> 21:20.605
- I'll let you know when he's available.

21:20.672 --> 21:22.006
- [scoffs]

21:24.575 --> 21:26.009
- Atta girl.
