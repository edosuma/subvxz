I just feel so guilty.

16:22.068 --> 16:23.504
Why?

16:23.547 --> 16:26.289
Because sometimes,

16:26.333 --> 16:28.248
I was as mean to Mom
as she was to me.

16:28.291 --> 16:29.379
Oh.

16:29.423 --> 16:31.164
She was just hard on you

16:31.207 --> 16:33.253
because sh-she
believed in you so much.

16:33.296 --> 16:35.211
Why do you always
have to defend her?

16:35.255 --> 16:37.692
Because I loved her!
I...

16:37.735 --> 16:39.520
[ Chuckles ]

16:39.563 --> 16:41.043
I can't believe I'm saying that
in the past tense.

16:41.087 --> 16:44.742
I -- I'm sorry that I had
a better relationship with her.

16:44.786 --> 16:47.267
And I'm -- I'm sorry that
it bothered you, okay?

16:47.310 --> 16:48.746
You have a better
relationship with Dad,

16:48.790 --> 16:51.184
and I know he loves me
just as much.

16:51.227 --> 16:52.924
Mmm...

16:52.968 --> 16:55.188
Yeah,
and when Dad dies,

16:55.231 --> 16:58.408
he's gonna leave knowing
how much I loved him.

16:58.452 --> 17:00.280
I'm not sure
Mom knew that.

17:00.323 --> 17:01.672
Of course she did.

17:01.716 --> 17:03.196
Really?

17:03.239 --> 17:05.328
Because unlike you,
the last time I talked to her,

17:05.372 --> 17:07.069
we got in a huge fight.

17:07.113 --> 17:08.983
Mm-hmm.

17:09.028 --> 17:13.205
You get to remember telling her
you loved her and laughing,

17:13.249 --> 17:15.946
and I get to remember
getting in some stupid argument

17:15.991 --> 17:17.558
about a Facebook post.

17:17.601 --> 17:20.082
The one where she said
putting eucalyptus oils

17:20.126 --> 17:22.084
on the soles of your feet
is a natural birth control?

17:22.127 --> 17:23.303
Yes. Yes.

17:23.346 --> 17:25.653
That's the one.
And you have

17:25.695 --> 17:27.349
a 12-year-old daughter
who reads those posts --

17:27.394 --> 17:29.178
you might want to tell her
that's not science.

17:29.222 --> 17:31.920
Okay, okay, remember
that last amazing conversation

17:31.963 --> 17:33.139
I had with Mom?Oh, for God's sakes.

17:33.182 --> 17:35.228
I'm sorry, but there's no other
way to describe it, okay?

17:35.271 --> 17:37.143
She told me about your fight,
and she --

17:37.186 --> 17:38.970
she told me
how upset she was.

17:39.014 --> 17:41.538
She -- She said she was gonna
call you to apologize.

17:41.582 --> 17:44.541
Oh, my God.

17:44.585 --> 17:47.588
She left me a voicemail
a couple days ago,

17:47.631 --> 17:49.111
but I was saving it
till the next time

17:49.155 --> 17:50.547
I had to yell at somebody
at work.

It's Mom.

17:56.423 --> 17:58.381

keep your daughters safe.

[ Sighs ] I have a daughter of my own,

she means to me.

Also, I saw your new photo
on social media.

18:22.623 --> 18:25.147
Are you part of some protest

18:25.191 --> 18:27.149
where you're not allowed
to wash your hair?

we've had our ups and downs,

being your son.

Hmm.
Are you...

'cause you ate my sandwich?

Oh!What is wrong with you?

18:56.831 --> 18:59.312
Seriously. What is this
obsession with a sandwich?

18:59.355 --> 19:01.401
I waited in line!

19:01.444 --> 19:03.359
[ Scoffs ]I was thinking about it
for months!

19:03.403 --> 19:05.666
You know
who would get this?

19:05.709 --> 19:08.625
Dede. That woman
appreciated a good sandwich.

19:08.669 --> 19:11.193
And she made
the best ones, you know,

19:11.237 --> 19:12.629
when we were
first married.

19:12.673 --> 19:15.197
In that little house
in the valley.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.416
And we didn't have
any money,

19:16.459 --> 19:18.461
but she would go
miles out of her way

19:18.505 --> 19:20.420
to get the bread
with the crunchy crust

19:20.463 --> 19:22.030
from that French bakery.

It was hard on the outside,
soft and warm on the inside,

"That's just like you, Jay."

to mess with Gloria.
