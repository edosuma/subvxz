00:10.636 --> 00:13.138
- Substation Three is down.|- How's that possible?

00:13.222 --> 00:15.682
Their self-destruct has been activated|from an outside source.

00:15.766 --> 00:17.684
And you didn't foresee this?

00:20.771 --> 00:22.397
Now what?

00:24.733 --> 00:26.276
Our self-destruct mechanism's|been activated.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.029
- Shut it down!|- There's a chance that might not happen.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.908
Whoever did this issued a chain directive.

00:32.991 --> 00:35.452
They want to destroy the Sections|like a stack of dominos.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.705
- Activate the fail-safe.|- I did. It won't engage.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.750
We need to evacuate.

00:43.544 --> 00:44.795
Okay. Go.

00:46.296 --> 00:50.092
- Proceed with evacuation.|- Get those weapons activated.

00:50.133 --> 00:52.636
Let's go. Move, move, move.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.223
Two minutes to self-destruct.

01:02.896 --> 01:06.191
- Come on. We're almost there.|- Come on! Come on!

01:06.275 --> 01:08.402
One minute to self-destruct.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.240
Okay, we're gone.|We got to get out of here now.

01:13.323 --> 01:16.994
Quinn, I've ordered you to leave your post.|We're 50 seconds to critical.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.663
- I can stop this.|- You've nothing to prove.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.665
Except that I can do my job.

01:26.879 --> 01:28.297
Get to work.

01:32.968 --> 01:34.970
Thirty seconds to self-destruct.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:44.062 --> 01:45.147
Come on.

01:47.191 --> 01:49.484
Think, Kate. Focus.

01:52.154 --> 01:56.408
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

01:56.491 --> 01:57.492
five, four...

01:58.744 --> 02:01.705
three, two, one.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.445
Walter?

03:21.118 --> 03:23.704
I got a message you wanted to see me.

03:26.164 --> 03:28.166
Way to go, little sister.

03:28.458 --> 03:31.628
- Got your feet wet.|- Excuse me?

03:33.672 --> 03:36.508
First day on the job. You saved our bacon.

03:36.967 --> 03:40.512
- Welcome to the big leagues.|- Is your bandana on too tight?

03:40.846 --> 03:45.225
- Operations thinks I dropped the ball.|- Forget about Operations.

03:45.976 --> 03:48.937
Substation Three is beyond|our security zone.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.981
You couldn't have known.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.400
You done good.

03:56.320 --> 03:59.615
- Birkoff would've been proud.|- Yes. Well, I hear he's dead.

03:59.698 --> 04:01.241
Stiffs do nothing for my ego.

04:03.452 --> 04:04.578
So what are we drinking?

04:07.122 --> 04:09.958
It's very old Scotch for special occasions.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.838
This isn't going to get you lucky.

04:18.132 --> 04:21.637
It's like I said, I was just welcoming you|to the neighborhood.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.307
Well, neighbor...

04:25.349 --> 04:29.853
just keep it zipped and out of my way,|and everything will be just peachy.

04:39.071 --> 04:40.280
Birkoff.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.501
I just got off the phone with Mr. Jones.

04:52.543 --> 04:53.627
What did he want?

04:53.710 --> 04:56.088
Birkoff in his office,|first of the next month.

04:57.005 --> 04:59.842
- A transfer?|- Yes.

05:00.717 --> 05:04.888
He can never find out what happened here.|I can't afford the anomaly on my record.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.223
I'll get Jason ready.

05:07.349 --> 05:08.392
Can you do it?

05:08.892 --> 05:10.185
When I'm done...

05:10.477 --> 05:14.022
will ever know the difference.

05:16.608 --> 05:20.863
As you know, Substation Three was|taken out of play yesterday morning.

05:21.572 --> 05:23.448
The strike was massive.

05:24.741 --> 05:27.536
The final damage report, 100% casualties.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.080
As best we can determine...

05:30.664 --> 05:33.917
the self-destruct code|came from an outside source.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.044
Now, Quinn's trace was incomplete...

05:36.086 --> 05:39.548
but her calculations|show a definite link to Red Cell.

05:39.590 --> 05:43.385
Now since they were able|to penetrate our system...

05:44.386 --> 05:49.391
for security measures only the Redline|and satellite links will be operational.

05:51.143 --> 05:55.814
This is Colin Starnes. He is currently,|the chief tactical advisor for Red Cell.

05:55.898 --> 05:57.065
Quinn.

05:57.107 --> 06:00.402
We've been using satellite tags|to get an exact location on him.

06:00.652 --> 06:02.905
We believe we have him contained|with a six-hour window.

06:02.988 --> 06:07.326
And we're going to use that window|to extract Starnes.

06:08.327 --> 06:11.330
Michael,|your team will handle field tactical.

06:11.997 --> 06:16.919
The target will be taken alive.|Details are on your panels.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.379
That's all.

07:12.558 --> 07:13.809
Charming.

07:17.646 --> 07:20.816
This entire process can be painless.|The choice is yours.

07:20.899 --> 07:23.110
For some, pain is pleasure.

07:23.610 --> 07:26.196
Good. Then you should enjoy yourself.

07:56.143 --> 07:59.521
Starnes claims that Red Cell|is inculpable for the hit.

07:59.563 --> 08:02.649
- You believe him?|- After this morning's chat...

08:02.900 --> 08:05.694
I don't think he has the strength to lie.

08:05.903 --> 08:07.196
Then what do you know?

08:07.279 --> 08:09.740
Our intel confirmed|two of Red Cell's locations...

08:09.781 --> 08:13.327
were hit within hours of the attack|on Substation Three.

08:13.577 --> 08:17.748
- So we're dealing with a third party?|- That's not what Red Cell believes.

08:22.252 --> 08:25.964
and moving into a unified tactical position.

08:27.132 --> 08:30.761
- They think it's us.|- And they're getting ready to strike.

08:33.514 --> 08:35.474
Not unless we attack first.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.480
Come on in.

08:44.566 --> 08:45.776
Welcome.

08:46.818 --> 08:51.114
I'd offer you a drink, but alas,|my hands are tied.

09:08.340 --> 09:11.468
I would have thought|you'd have killed me by now.

09:12.135 --> 09:13.762
Losing your edge?

09:14.471 --> 09:15.931
Perfecting it.

09:17.641 --> 09:19.184
I have a proposition for you.

09:43.166 --> 09:46.461
I've got a coded transmission|coming from Section One.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.922
You'll need this key to unlock it.

10:01.143 --> 10:03.729
How is it that you're still breathing?

10:04.188 --> 10:08.483
Section One protocol is to terminate|all captured operatives.

10:09.026 --> 10:11.820
only I could deliver.

10:12.654 --> 10:13.780
A meeting with you.

10:15.991 --> 10:17.367
Intriguing.

10:18.869 --> 10:22.497
But you don't actually think|that I would consider it, do you?

10:22.581 --> 10:24.541
falls under my purview...

10:24.583 --> 10:26.251
I expect you to agree to it.

10:28.879 --> 10:30.923
You no longer work for me.

10:31.924 --> 10:34.009
Then consider this...

10:35.427 --> 10:36.970
a consultation.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.016
We're in a standoff.

10:41.308 --> 10:45.646
or you annihilate each other.

10:46.897 --> 10:49.525
I highly suggest you accept the offer.

10:51.109 --> 10:53.278
Section knows your next move.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.948
You don't really have a choice.

10:59.243 --> 11:03.163
Ten seconds until the channel is clear.|Incoming cyber text.

11:06.041 --> 11:07.626
Securing the line.

11:09.211 --> 11:11.964
You understand why I called this meeting?

11:12.089 --> 11:16.051
You believe that someone|is trying to play us against each other.

11:17.761 --> 11:21.598
- What are you proposing?|- Mutual truce for 48 hours.

11:27.312 --> 11:30.023
We've both sustained significant loses.

11:31.066 --> 11:33.569
If we pool our resources together...

11:33.944 --> 11:37.865
the enemy's termination.

11:44.246 --> 11:46.456
could result in global impact.

11:46.790 --> 11:49.877
If I were to agree...

11:49.960 --> 11:52.087
to a moratorium on Red Cell activities...

11:52.129 --> 11:55.257
what guarantee would I have|that you would do the same?

11:55.507 --> 11:58.927
to insure the truce.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.433
He's dead.

12:04.766 --> 12:07.227
further up the food chain.

12:08.437 --> 12:11.315
A key operative that isn't expendable.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.775
One of ours for one of yours.

12:19.615 --> 12:22.159
The director has agreed to the truce.

12:22.576 --> 12:25.245
To secure it, we'll each exchange...

12:25.329 --> 12:27.456
an upper level team member.

12:27.539 --> 12:28.707
Quinn.

12:30.083 --> 12:33.378
Satin Tate, an expert profiler...

12:34.213 --> 12:37.174
graduated Georgetown University at 16.

12:37.966 --> 12:39.343
She applied to the CIA...

12:39.384 --> 12:42.846
and was hired|due to her exemplary academic record.

12:43.013 --> 12:45.390
At 19, she become a free agent...

12:46.016 --> 12:48.310
then joined Red Cell a year later.

12:48.352 --> 12:49.978
In less than three years...

12:50.062 --> 12:51.813
she's worked her way|to second in command.

12:51.897 --> 12:53.857
She'll be with us for 48 hours.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.776
You want us to work with the enemy?

12:55.859 --> 12:58.320
Satin's going to lend us her expertise...

12:58.403 --> 13:01.657
and assist us in finding|who's responsible for the attacks.

13:02.783 --> 13:05.077
Who will we send in, in exchange?

13:10.666 --> 13:12.125
I'll get ready.

13:43.115 --> 13:47.327
But remember your secondary objective.

13:47.828 --> 13:52.207
then locate a window for transmission.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.379
Just send everything you find to Quinn.

13:57.462 --> 13:59.214
But remember...

13:59.256 --> 14:01.758
whatever you find out I want to know first.

16:13.015 --> 16:16.518
- Not what you were expecting, is it?|- It seems adequate.

16:18.562 --> 16:21.940
Section One's exposure of our main base...

16:22.566 --> 16:26.195
and the capture of the Cardinal|were significant setbacks.

16:28.113 --> 16:29.907
But we're rebuilding.

16:33.869 --> 16:35.329
What we lack in resources...

16:35.412 --> 16:37.664
we more than make up for|with our tenacity.

16:37.748 --> 16:40.417
You've always been|a formidable adversary.

16:40.501 --> 16:44.171
We've downloaded the necessary data|on the substations that were hit.

16:44.254 --> 16:46.423
This will be your workstation.

16:51.386 --> 16:52.596
Please...

16:54.014 --> 16:57.726
- If there's anything you "need..."|- A glass of water, please.

17:35.764 --> 17:38.976
Our shared intel shows|there's a definite pattern to the attacks.

17:39.059 --> 17:41.270
The methodology was identical.

17:42.729 --> 17:46.149
This task was a simple comparative|search. Any rookie could have done it.

17:46.233 --> 17:49.361
It's not the case|with the profile you requested.

17:49.570 --> 17:52.197
I'll need security clearance|to access satellite data.

17:54.575 --> 17:55.617
That's not possible.

17:59.246 --> 18:00.747
How do you expect me to do my job?

18:02.457 --> 18:04.793
Quinn will run the data for you.

18:17.055 --> 18:19.016
And what did you expect?

18:19.933 --> 18:21.935
Horns and cloven hooves?

18:23.270 --> 18:25.314
That's exactly what I see.

18:25.564 --> 18:28.525
All wrapped up in a pretty little package.

18:28.817 --> 18:30.986
We're gonna have to keep our eyes on her.

18:32.196 --> 18:34.907
Not under this roof. Her hands are tied.

18:36.158 --> 18:38.202
Don't believe that for a second, sugar.

18:39.161 --> 18:42.039
Adrian once said, "Poison one flower...

18:43.457 --> 18:46.126
"and eventually the whole garden dies."

18:59.139 --> 19:02.643
Truce, remember?|We're supposed to be helping each other?

19:07.481 --> 19:10.108
I expect your report in three hours.

19:11.944 --> 19:13.820
You'll have it in two.

19:32.422 --> 19:35.551
You layered a command code|without a security seal?

19:35.592 --> 19:37.219
- Sorry.|- Sorry?

19:37.803 --> 19:40.889
Sorry gets you a one-way ticket|to Containment.

19:41.306 --> 19:43.559
Look, why don't you go|and see Bandana Boy...

19:43.600 --> 19:45.060
and ask him to issue you a brain?

19:45.102 --> 19:47.229
Then go back|to your little data-crunching cubicle...

19:47.271 --> 19:49.398
and drop in a security seal.

19:50.899 --> 19:52.067
Now go!

19:57.531 --> 19:58.574
Hi.

19:59.241 --> 20:01.994
Back up.|You're messing with my feng shui.

20:03.287 --> 20:06.081
- You must be Quinn?|- And you are?

20:07.124 --> 20:09.251
I am your new Second.

20:10.961 --> 20:12.462
Madeline's orders. I'm to observe...

20:12.546 --> 20:14.673
and lend a hand where needed.

20:14.965 --> 20:16.216
Name's Jason.

20:18.302 --> 20:20.095
So you're the twin.

20:21.597 --> 20:22.681
Yeah.

20:23.932 --> 20:26.268
Well, not everything's the same.

20:26.602 --> 20:29.479
Maybe you should take a test drive|and see for yourself.

20:37.905 --> 20:39.239
I'll pass.

20:41.825 --> 20:43.327
That's cool.

20:45.204 --> 20:47.414
There's plenty of time, darling.

20:48.165 --> 20:50.542
I'm sure you'll change your mind.

20:59.593 --> 21:00.969
The report.

21:05.015 --> 21:06.975
You're much better looking in person.

21:10.604 --> 21:14.233
- You can go now.|- Older, yes.

21:16.026 --> 21:18.862
Your face is filled in|with so much character.

21:19.363 --> 21:20.489
Not surprising...

21:20.531 --> 21:23.325
considering the things you must have|gone through since being here.

21:27.871 --> 21:29.122
What is your point?

21:47.558 --> 21:50.018
I've carried it with me for years.

21:50.269 --> 21:52.729
You were my inspiration,|Michael Samuelle.

21:53.063 --> 21:54.523
A fighter.

21:54.565 --> 21:57.568
With total dedication|and passion for your cause.

21:59.319 --> 22:00.863
You fought with sticks and stones...

22:00.946 --> 22:03.323
yet managed to make them|see things your way.

22:06.451 --> 22:07.828
Where is this man?

22:10.330 --> 22:11.915
What's happened to him?

22:15.878 --> 22:18.839
You once believed in something|you thought was worth dying for.

22:24.928 --> 22:26.763
How long are you going to let them|use you?

22:30.893 --> 22:33.270
There's a meeting in Systems|in 20 minutes.

22:58.545 --> 23:01.256
- Is it really you?|- It is.

23:02.341 --> 23:04.760
You once said,|a person defines themselves...

23:04.801 --> 23:07.304
by what they are willing to die for.

23:08.472 --> 23:10.432
I will die for a belief.

23:12.476 --> 23:15.187
And you will die because you have none.

23:28.158 --> 23:29.201
What do we have?

23:31.703 --> 23:34.957
Well, there are several possibilities.|We're still looking for a definitive.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.793
Don't be evasive.|You're here to assist in the search.

23:37.835 --> 23:40.462
Take a position. Tell me what you think.

23:40.546 --> 23:43.298
Well, after reviewing all the hard data,|I believe that a random...

23:43.382 --> 23:46.134
- must have attacked the Substations.|- Is that possible?

23:46.385 --> 23:49.012
Think about it. Red Cell and|Section One are both protected...

23:49.096 --> 23:51.348
to a degree, from each other...

23:51.431 --> 23:53.976
but not from a guy|with a grenade and a cause.

23:54.017 --> 23:55.561
I don't accept that.

23:57.855 --> 24:01.483
Because you think I'm wrong|or because you didn't think of it first?

24:05.195 --> 24:08.657
Quinn, transmit Satin's analysis|to Red Cell.

24:08.740 --> 24:11.910
See if they've come|to a similar conclusion.

24:11.994 --> 24:15.414
In the meantime,|I want the rest of you running profiles...

24:15.497 --> 24:16.874
on possible freelance candidates.

24:16.957 --> 24:19.877
- That's all.|- Michael, wait.

24:23.630 --> 24:26.842
Why is it so difficult for you|to accept my theory?

24:27.009 --> 24:29.720
For once we're fighting for the same goal.

24:30.012 --> 24:31.180
I know.

24:32.389 --> 24:35.475
Think about it.|You used to be a random yourself.

24:35.559 --> 24:38.395
You even once believed|that one man could make a difference.

24:41.648 --> 24:44.818
You were special, Michael.|This place has changed you.

25:20.812 --> 25:23.899
I've narrowed a possible location|on the random.

25:24.316 --> 25:27.319
Tell Quinn to focus|on the northeast quadrant.

25:27.736 --> 25:29.613
Good. And the Director?

25:30.072 --> 25:31.782
As you requested, he knows nothing.

25:32.324 --> 25:33.492
Keep it that way.

25:33.575 --> 25:34.618
For how long?

25:34.701 --> 25:36.954
At least 12 hours.|Whatever it takes, stall him.

25:37.037 --> 25:40.165
I don't want him finding this person|before I do.

26:08.485 --> 26:10.904
There's a briefing in 10 minutes.

26:11.697 --> 26:12.739
I'll get Satin.

26:13.323 --> 26:15.033
Operations wants her excluded.

26:15.117 --> 26:17.828
I'm supposed to keep her busy|running a sim on Level 4.

27:05.542 --> 27:07.753
I assume our deal still holds?

27:10.756 --> 27:13.509
Sure I'm not being kept out of the loop?

27:13.592 --> 27:17.137
Your briefing had nothing to do|with our current status?

27:17.638 --> 27:18.680
No.

27:21.350 --> 27:22.434
Good.

27:29.358 --> 27:32.069
How long are you going to play this out?

27:33.820 --> 27:37.533
It's no secret there's tension|between you and Section One.

27:39.743 --> 27:42.496
Everyone's expendable, Michael, even you.

27:42.913 --> 27:45.707
You know how they work.|You won't even see it coming.

27:51.171 --> 27:53.757
Don't you remember|what it's like to fight with friends?

27:55.259 --> 27:57.052
People you can trust?

28:01.431 --> 28:03.892
It's time for you to make a choice.

28:22.494 --> 28:23.954
I have to go.

28:29.251 --> 28:31.170
I've locked on the coordinates|that Madeline sent...

28:31.253 --> 28:35.090
regarding the random and located|the nucleus of their headquarters.

28:35.632 --> 28:38.093
- How big is their operation?|- Small.

28:38.635 --> 28:39.678
How small?

28:39.970 --> 28:43.640
I haven't had any luck using thermal|to scan for a concise head count.

28:43.724 --> 28:46.685
- They may be mobile.|- Nothing I've seen indicates that.

28:49.313 --> 28:52.316
Our time is critical.|We'll proceed without total data.

28:52.399 --> 28:55.944
We don't have any other choice|but to go into this blind.

28:56.153 --> 28:58.697
There are only hours left for this truce.

28:58.780 --> 29:01.408
I expect your team to be ready|within the hour.

29:12.503 --> 29:14.296
First team is mobile.

29:16.548 --> 29:19.259
Okay, Michael.|We've got movement on site. Top floor.

30:06.348 --> 30:08.475
I'm this way.

30:09.309 --> 30:13.105
I'm so getting ahead of them.|This is so easy.

30:20.654 --> 30:23.991
But I'm still three substations|ahead of you.

30:29.413 --> 30:31.498
But I guess it's your move.

30:43.594 --> 30:46.722
- He thought he was playing a game?|- A war game.

30:47.306 --> 30:50.517
How could he get into our system|without detection?

30:50.684 --> 30:53.478
The guy's a genius. Right off the charts.

30:53.604 --> 30:55.063
It's never been done.

30:55.105 --> 30:58.233
That's because we've never encountered|a guy like this.

30:58.317 --> 31:00.903
The best hacking is always traceless.

31:01.278 --> 31:04.907
He circumvented all security|by loading an R-45 Footprint.

31:05.908 --> 31:08.702
So once he had access to our mainframe...

31:09.536 --> 31:11.788
- he had total control?|- Exactly.

31:12.039 --> 31:15.501
He disabled the defense system,|then detonated the self-destruct.

31:15.584 --> 31:18.712
He even rigged it to look as if|the players were attacking each other.

31:18.795 --> 31:22.299
That would explain how|you got a partial trace to Red Cell.

31:22.382 --> 31:23.509
Right.

31:24.051 --> 31:26.386
Like I said, the guy's a genius.

31:31.642 --> 31:33.435
This R-45 Footprint...

31:33.977 --> 31:37.022
can we use that to access Red Cell?

31:39.816 --> 31:42.110
If we wanted to break the truce.

31:42.194 --> 31:45.155
The R-45 Footprint would set|permanent damage into motion.

31:58.085 --> 31:59.127
No.

32:07.553 --> 32:08.637
Wait.

32:10.973 --> 32:12.474
You can go now.

32:28.699 --> 32:31.702
I'm sorry. Whatever I did.

32:31.743 --> 32:33.662
I didn't do anything on purpose.

32:35.080 --> 32:37.875
- That doesn't matter.|- I just "wanted..."

32:38.041 --> 32:42.004
I'm willing to wipe the slate clean.|Give you a fresh new start.

32:42.921 --> 32:44.965
And all I ask in return...

32:46.091 --> 32:47.801
is your cooperation.

32:50.554 --> 32:53.515
Sure. Fine. That sounds like a plan.

32:58.228 --> 33:01.023
You've made the right choice, Mr. Harlan.

33:03.066 --> 33:05.110
What do you want me to do?

33:09.281 --> 33:12.618
I want you to pretend this is still a game...

33:14.912 --> 33:18.081
and help us wipe out the other side.

33:22.503 --> 33:23.587
Okay.

33:25.923 --> 33:27.007
Good.

33:38.560 --> 33:41.230
I would have thought Quinn could have|narrowed it down by now.

33:42.356 --> 33:45.859
Apparently it was more challenging|than you anticipated.

33:45.943 --> 33:47.236
I'll keep you posted.

33:48.320 --> 33:49.780
I look forward to the results.

33:51.198 --> 33:53.534
You'll be the first to see them.

34:02.501 --> 34:04.711
I have Madeline on B-Channel.

34:09.800 --> 34:12.594
- I'll get Operations.|- No. There's no time.

34:13.136 --> 34:16.056
I just want to know, has the random|given you any useful information?

34:16.431 --> 34:19.685
So far, he's admitted to the hits|and setting off the self-destruct.

34:19.768 --> 34:20.853
Anything else?

34:22.353 --> 34:24.940
Just that he thought|he was playing a war game.

34:25.023 --> 34:26.567
How did he gain access?

34:26.650 --> 34:29.110
He said he used an R-45 Footprint.

34:30.027 --> 34:31.655
Have you located it yet?

34:33.824 --> 34:34.992
Not yet.

34:35.993 --> 34:38.036
Just one more thing, Quinn.

34:38.911 --> 34:41.123
I'd like to see the most recent data.

34:43.625 --> 34:44.918
That's been frozen.

34:45.502 --> 34:46.670
On whose authority?

34:47.295 --> 34:48.338
Operations'.

34:48.755 --> 34:50.299
He doesn't want me to see it?

34:51.007 --> 34:52.842
Madeline, I've got|a Cipher Channel coming in.

34:52.926 --> 34:54.136
I have to go.

35:02.019 --> 35:03.604
You lied to her.

35:04.271 --> 35:06.732
There's no Cipher Channel coming in.

35:07.733 --> 35:12.112
- And your point is?|- It's obvious something's going on.

35:13.238 --> 35:14.323
Yes.

35:15.407 --> 35:18.493
Operations is using Harlan|to destroy Red Cell.

35:19.661 --> 35:22.247
And Madeline is going|to get caught in the crossfire.

35:23.874 --> 35:26.001
I have a feeling she won't be missed.

35:26.877 --> 35:28.670
And if she survives...

35:30.047 --> 35:32.382
she'll go to war with Operations.

35:33.050 --> 35:34.343
Trust me, darling, I've seen...

35:34.384 --> 35:36.553
this kind of boardroom back-stabbing|first-hand...

35:37.554 --> 35:39.181
and it gets messy.

35:39.806 --> 35:43.685
This place will be looking at some|major corporate restructuring.

35:43.769 --> 35:46.355
You and I will be forced to choose sides.

35:48.899 --> 35:50.734
Well, that won't happen.

35:51.276 --> 35:53.403
Madeline is as good as dead.

35:54.696 --> 35:56.573
She's in the dark, Junior.

35:56.865 --> 35:59.034
Operations isn't telling her anything.

36:08.794 --> 36:10.379
Get back to work.

36:49.835 --> 36:51.086
For Rene.

36:51.962 --> 36:53.630
Thank you, Michael.

37:07.644 --> 37:09.438
What did you just do?

37:47.476 --> 37:50.062
Sir, we just received this from Satin.

37:51.688 --> 37:53.774
Escort her to her quarters.

38:00.572 --> 38:02.574
See what we've got.

38:22.010 --> 38:24.304
That's Section One's Directory.

38:26.098 --> 38:28.642
- Sir, there's more.|- Well, put it up.

38:33.856 --> 38:36.817
Looks like we may have|the coordinates for Section One.

38:37.234 --> 38:38.694
Give it to me.

38:40.946 --> 38:43.949
They're encrypted, sir.|I'll start the decoding process.

38:47.953 --> 38:50.497
Quinn, I need you to trace|a cyber plant with me.

38:50.581 --> 38:53.250
- Origins?|- Communiqué between Satin and Red Cell.

38:53.625 --> 38:55.586
- I'll get right on it.|- No.

38:57.212 --> 38:59.756
- Do it here.|- This is Eyes Only.

39:09.975 --> 39:13.395
With Section One's Directory|and their coordinates...

39:13.437 --> 39:16.023
we can wipe them off|the face of the Earth.

39:16.106 --> 39:18.734
How long until|we have the exact coordinates?

39:19.193 --> 39:21.695
- How long?|- Twenty minutes.

39:22.362 --> 39:24.364
They're running the program|she sent them.

39:24.865 --> 39:25.908
Good.

39:26.742 --> 39:30.454
There was a self-destruct signal|layered into the text.

39:31.788 --> 39:34.458
Satin believed Michael was helping her.

39:34.625 --> 39:37.252
She'll be responsible|for destroying Red Cell.

39:38.337 --> 39:39.880
I want you to activate it.

40:17.459 --> 40:18.460
What's going on?

40:18.544 --> 40:20.587
The self-destruct mechanism|has been activated.

40:20.671 --> 40:22.047
Well, override it.

40:26.301 --> 40:27.469
Quickly.

40:29.054 --> 40:31.598
I can't get in!|I'm locked out of the system!

40:34.810 --> 40:36.854
Got it! Go ahead! Run! Come on!

40:36.937 --> 40:40.315
- Gear down!

40:41.358 --> 40:42.776
We're moving here!

40:44.027 --> 40:45.696
There's nothing I can do.

41:07.217 --> 41:08.510
Is Madeline dead?

41:11.805 --> 41:13.307
There were no survivors.

41:24.943 --> 41:26.528
Don't know how I feel.

41:31.283 --> 41:33.911
We destroyed Red Cell's|base of operations.

41:33.994 --> 41:36.205
I know what the trade-off was.

41:38.916 --> 41:41.293
I can't help but wonder whether...

41:43.045 --> 41:45.714
it was worth sacrificing one of our own.

41:51.595 --> 41:55.516
Working with the enemy|has had some residual effects on morale.

41:56.016 --> 41:57.601
You'll handle it?

41:58.268 --> 41:59.561
Of course.

42:00.354 --> 42:02.314
All things considered...

42:03.273 --> 42:05.192
the operation went well.

42:05.275 --> 42:07.945
I've instructed Quinn|to revamp our system security.

42:08.028 --> 42:09.112
Good.

42:28.298 --> 42:29.883
You deceived me.

42:32.469 --> 42:34.471
I did what I believed in.

43:13.051 --> 43:14.636
Congratulations.

43:17.014 --> 43:18.348
Thank you.
