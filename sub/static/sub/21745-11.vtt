WEBVTT

00:05.873 --> 00:08.176
ANNOUNCER: The Assassination
of Gianni Versace.

00:08.209 --> 00:10.744
Premieres Wednesday,
January 17 on FX.

00:13.347 --> 00:17.017
FXX presents You're the Worst.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.721
GRETCHEN: I don't get it.
What's international night?

00:20.754 --> 00:22.356
BOONE: It's this thing
we do with Olivia

00:22.390 --> 00:24.225
to broaden her palette.
You and she each pick a country,

00:24.258 --> 00:26.026
you do a little presentation
on it,

00:26.060 --> 00:28.162
I pick the winner,
and we order food from there.

00:28.196 --> 00:30.864
-Ugh. Homework?
-BOONE: Oh, my God.

00:30.898 --> 00:33.734
Just pick France,
wear a beret, say a fact,

00:33.767 --> 00:35.769
-and you're done.
-Okay.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.171
I'll do your stupid report.

00:37.205 --> 00:38.839
And afterwards, I'm gonna suck

00:38.872 --> 00:41.509
all the skin off your dick,
like I'm a... -Ah!

00:41.542 --> 00:43.043
Speaker phone!
Child in the kitchen!

00:44.745 --> 00:46.714
Hi, guys.

00:46.747 --> 00:49.417
Not that we don't
value listening

00:49.450 --> 00:51.552
to you describe fellatio

00:51.585 --> 00:54.722
so graphically that
I just got vomit saliva,

00:54.755 --> 00:56.757
but what are we doing here?

00:56.790 --> 00:59.793
You guys said you wanted to
diversify your audience, right?

00:59.827 --> 01:02.630
Trying to get that "shower with
the LED mood-lighting" money.

01:02.663 --> 01:05.099
Which is why I want to introduce
you to a client of mine

01:05.133 --> 01:07.101
who's looking to collaborate.

01:08.302 --> 01:11.972
His name is Ben Folds.

01:12.005 --> 01:15.409
Ben Folds? You mean that Billy
Joel, Harry Potter-looking dude?

01:15.443 --> 01:18.612
Yes. He is huge with college
educated, affluent white people.

01:18.646 --> 01:21.882
If you guys did a song together,
it would be massive.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.051
I don't want to just throw out
the phrase,

01:24.084 --> 01:27.588
"Plays over the Grey's Anatomy
credits," but, yeah, that.

01:27.621 --> 01:29.590
Hell yeah.
Yeah, yeah. We're in.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.892
You guys are gonna love him,
and I will be there

01:31.925 --> 01:33.594
to make sure everything
goes smoothly.

01:34.628 --> 01:35.629
Ben!

01:37.331 --> 01:38.799
This is Sam and Shitstain.

01:38.832 --> 01:40.134
Guys, this is Ben.

01:40.168 --> 01:42.102
-Hey, guys.
-SHITSTAIN: Hey.

01:42.136 --> 01:43.771
Really good to meet you.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.806
This is a really nice place.

01:45.839 --> 01:47.341
You think they serve alcohol?

01:47.375 --> 01:49.577
Uh, yeah.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.245
I-I think so.

01:51.279 --> 01:54.748
-Hey, could we get some alcohol?
-Sure.

01:54.782 --> 01:57.418
GRETCHEN: I'll just have
whatever your whiskey drink is.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.919
Ooh, that sounds amazing.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.488
Yeah, I'll have one, too.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.456
Damn, you must be
thirsty as shit.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.425
It's just that back
in North Carolina,

02:04.458 --> 02:06.527
there are all these regulations
on hours and distributors,

02:06.560 --> 02:09.930
and we definitely don't have
your crazy mixed drinks

02:09.963 --> 02:11.365
like you have out here.

02:11.399 --> 02:13.934
I mean, basil in gin?

02:13.967 --> 02:16.604
Your taste buds are like,
"What the heck?"

02:16.637 --> 02:18.272
GRETCHEN:
(laughs) Anyway, Ben,

02:18.306 --> 02:20.608
these guys are really excited
about the idea

02:20.641 --> 02:22.476
-of collaborating.
-Oh, look.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.978
I've been a huge fan since
"Pussy On Swole."

02:25.012 --> 02:27.615
I mess around with it
in sound check all the time.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.617
(imitates beat)

02:29.650 --> 02:31.552
* Girl got pussy

02:31.585 --> 02:32.953
* On swole, uh

02:32.986 --> 02:34.555
* She makin' me crabby

02:34.588 --> 02:37.191
* Uh, I want her heart

02:37.225 --> 02:38.326
* And I want her soul

02:38.359 --> 02:39.393
* And them titties

02:39.427 --> 02:41.629
* Them titties ain't shabby.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.197
(inhales sharply)

02:45.065 --> 02:46.800
Damn, dude. That's tight.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.336
Yeah, I like that shit.
Okay, okay.

02:48.369 --> 02:51.004
Why don't we link up at
the studio tomorrow night,

02:51.038 --> 02:52.139
and lay something down?

02:52.172 --> 02:53.474
Let's do it.

02:53.507 --> 02:56.510
Whoa, look at all that alcohol.

03:10.458 --> 03:13.661
* I'm gonna leave you anyway

03:13.694 --> 03:16.697
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

03:16.730 --> 03:19.533
* Gonna leave you anyway.

03:23.904 --> 03:27.908
* Dun, dun, dun, dun.

03:27.941 --> 03:30.244
Oh, I guess
you're having one, too.

03:30.278 --> 03:32.212
So, what's the big news?

03:32.246 --> 03:34.848
Jimmy, The Width of a Peach

03:34.882 --> 03:37.117
is number 13

03:37.150 --> 03:39.753
on The New York Times

03:39.787 --> 03:41.522
Best Seller list
for Mass-Market,

03:41.555 --> 03:43.223
Paperback Fiction.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.559
-What?!
-(Candace laughs)

03:45.593 --> 03:48.128
This is amazing!

03:48.161 --> 03:50.398
I have to admit,
I tried to act

03:50.431 --> 03:52.766
like making the Amazon list
wasn't a massive disappointment,

03:52.800 --> 03:55.803
but let's face it, it's like
winning a Daytime Emmy.

03:55.836 --> 03:58.105
You're burnt, Ellen.

03:58.138 --> 03:59.907
So, we have to ride
the momentum. There's Harry,

03:59.940 --> 04:02.710
-with Harry Connick Jr.,
very big with women. -Eh.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.878
Watch What Happens Live,
women and gays.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.447
-(groans)
-The People's Choice Awards,

04:06.480 --> 04:09.783
women, gays, teens,
plus general dummies.

04:09.817 --> 04:12.620
-Ugh. -I can read you
the loser suggestions.

04:12.653 --> 04:15.088
Uh, let's see. Tomorrow night is
Tip of My Tongue,

04:15.122 --> 04:18.492
an NPR game show for dweebs,
hosted by Steeb Corniglia.

04:18.526 --> 04:20.894
Steeb Corniglia loves me.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.831
Impressing him would be
the ideal way

04:23.864 --> 04:26.567
to show that I can write
a hot wanker

04:26.600 --> 04:29.737
and still have the respect of
a noted literary critic.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.705
Book me on that show.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.946
-(Lindsay sighs)
-(door closes)

04:38.979 --> 04:40.280
I didn't exactly know
what you meant by

04:40.314 --> 04:42.316
"grab work clothes
from France."

04:42.350 --> 04:44.518
Are you fake
going to Paris again?

04:44.552 --> 04:46.320
No, it's just
for this dumb thing

04:46.354 --> 04:47.988
I'm doing with Boone tomorrow.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.289
An Eiffel Tower?

04:49.323 --> 04:51.258
Jealous. Who's your third?

04:51.291 --> 04:54.595
But I'm gonna see you afterwards
at Jimmy's radio thingy, right?

04:54.628 --> 04:56.330
I don't want to go,

04:56.364 --> 04:58.031
but I'm supposed to be
helping people right now,

04:58.065 --> 04:59.967
like Lou Diamond Philips
told me to.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.301
What radio thingy?

05:05.305 --> 05:07.040
"Please join me tomorrow night

05:07.074 --> 05:10.544
"for a live taping of NPR's
Tip of My Tongue.

05:10.578 --> 05:11.979
You can laugh
at my delightful jokes

05:12.012 --> 05:13.847
and whatever
hilariously tragic look

05:13.881 --> 05:17.317
Steeb has concocted
for the evening."

05:17.351 --> 05:18.852
Oh!

05:18.886 --> 05:22.623
I could help Steeb
not look so tragical.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.893
I'm full of good clothes ideas.

05:25.926 --> 05:29.630
I'm like an armoire,
but I'm a people.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.231
Want me to see
if I can get you in?

05:31.264 --> 05:33.834
Jimmy didn't invite me.
Nah, nephew.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.203
I'm doing international night
with Boone.

05:36.236 --> 05:37.638
What's international night?

05:37.671 --> 05:39.673
More boring dad shit?

05:39.707 --> 05:41.074
Don't be sleeping on dads.

05:41.108 --> 05:42.710
Dads know how to
bang down real good,

05:42.743 --> 05:44.545
on account of they
pregged up a bitch before.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.079
That tracks.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.516
(with French accent):
Ooh, la, la.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.518
Happy French day, Booner.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.986
(both moan)

05:53.020 --> 05:57.658
Kuwait seeks OPEC oil cuts.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.493
Ah. Okay, um...

05:59.527 --> 06:01.529
(growls)

06:01.562 --> 06:04.598
Well, if you Ku-wait

06:04.632 --> 06:06.434
on producing that oil,

06:06.467 --> 06:09.102
I'll sleep like I-raq.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.704
(laughs)

06:10.738 --> 06:12.339
I remember my first time
in Kuwait.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.543
It was 113 degrees,
which sounds bad,

06:15.576 --> 06:17.411
but actually,
the pools of blood were...

06:17.445 --> 06:20.714
Eject! (clears throat)
Right, so,

06:20.748 --> 06:23.283
we have covered current events,
historical limericks,

06:23.316 --> 06:25.953
quirky human interest.

06:25.986 --> 06:28.689
I think Steeb and his listeners
are gonna be blown away

06:28.722 --> 06:31.725
by what's on
the tip of my tongue.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.126
-What is it?
-What's gonna be on there?

06:33.160 --> 06:35.228
It-it's jokes.

06:35.262 --> 06:37.397
-Oh. I get it.
-Oh, yeah. Right, yeah.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.132
-Jokes. Jokes.
-Yeah, right.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.367
You want a little insurance?

06:40.400 --> 06:42.570
Explain, Edgar's friend.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.371
You have a plant in the crowd

06:44.404 --> 06:46.273
shout out a lame,
prepared heckle

06:46.306 --> 06:48.308
that you have
a great comeback for.

06:48.341 --> 06:49.543
It's called a "Mencia."

06:49.577 --> 06:50.911
Isn't Vernon gonna be there?

06:50.944 --> 06:53.180
-He'll do it.
-Great idea.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.117
I'm sorry Jimmy isn't
a good friend to you.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.953
Hey, I'll always listen to
anything you have to say.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.590
-Thanks, man. That means a lot.
-Mm-hmm.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.558
But...

07:04.592 --> 07:07.495
I'm not really great
about opening up.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.396
Why don't you tell me what you
were gonna tell Jimmy earlier,

07:09.429 --> 07:10.598
but he didn't let you?

07:10.631 --> 07:12.933
Okay.

07:12.966 --> 07:16.303
Well, um...

07:16.336 --> 07:18.839
You see,
I was stationed in Kuwait

07:18.872 --> 07:20.574
before moving into Anfal.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.576
And Anfal, it's known
for its architecture, right?

07:22.610 --> 07:26.446
No, its genocide.
So there we were,

07:26.480 --> 07:30.250
three klicks south
of Ali Sabah Al-Salem...

07:30.283 --> 07:32.152
-(soft piano music playing)
-(microphone feedback)

07:32.185 --> 07:34.021
WOMAN:
Check. One, two, check.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.089
(indistinct chatter)

07:36.123 --> 07:38.158
VERNON:
Jimmy!

07:38.191 --> 07:39.860
So stoked to be here.

07:39.893 --> 07:42.863
Truth be told, I've been on
for 72 straight hours,

07:42.896 --> 07:46.133
and I'm kind of seeing a lot of
spiders made out of light.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.701
But I'm good to go.

07:47.735 --> 07:50.804
I got a Camelback full of
Casamigos and Monster Energy.

07:50.838 --> 07:55.108
Right. I need your help
with a super-secret heckle.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.977
If you hear me say the words,

07:57.010 --> 08:00.113
"That was a squeaker," you
yell out this prewritten quip

08:00.147 --> 08:03.951
for which I have prepared
a killer comedic response.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.553
Nice.

08:20.534 --> 08:22.502
(Lindsay sighs)

08:24.104 --> 08:26.306
He needs my help.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.808
Excuse me.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.143
Hi. I'm Lindsay.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.979
-Why, hello.
-(chuckles)

08:32.012 --> 08:34.214
No need to be timorous.

08:34.247 --> 08:36.584
I love meeting my fans.

08:36.617 --> 08:39.186
No. I don't know
any of this dork crap.

08:39.219 --> 08:40.353
I'm a friend of Jimmy's,

08:40.387 --> 08:41.922
and I'm a stylist.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.223
Ooh, I adore Jimmy.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.925
Between you and me,

08:44.958 --> 08:46.660
it felt like a cacodoxy

08:46.694 --> 08:50.497
to be sidetracked
by a genre experiment. Concur?

08:50.530 --> 08:52.833
Listen, I thought
you might be looking for someone

08:52.866 --> 08:55.936
to update your "tragic look."

08:55.969 --> 08:58.238
"Tragic look"?

08:58.271 --> 08:59.573
Who said that?

08:59.607 --> 09:00.808
Duh. Jimmy.

09:07.915 --> 09:10.751
Czesc. My country is Poland.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.753
Poland? (laughs)

09:12.786 --> 09:15.422
Nice choice. What,
was Kyrgyzstan already taken?

09:15.455 --> 09:17.057
Poland is
the ninth largest country

09:17.090 --> 09:18.558
in Europe.

09:18.592 --> 09:21.629
They boast
17 Nobel Prize winners,

09:21.662 --> 09:23.931
and their main foods
are pierogies,

09:23.964 --> 09:26.900
kielbasa and golumpkies.

09:26.934 --> 09:30.604
(laughing):
What? "Blumpkins"?

09:32.305 --> 09:34.942
Spoiler alert:
this bitch is toast.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.578
JIMMY: From the beginning,
I was screwed.

09:38.612 --> 09:41.148
My mom's uterus was L-shaped.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.250
That's why I have
equilibrium problems.

09:43.283 --> 09:46.553
And then in the fourth grade,
my friend pooped his pants,

09:46.586 --> 09:49.623
so I did, too,
out of solidarity, and...

09:49.657 --> 09:51.625
I liked it.

09:51.659 --> 09:53.393
So, at first, we just tried,

09:53.426 --> 09:56.396
you know, sticking straws
directly into the camel's humps,

09:56.429 --> 09:58.298
but he was not having that.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.133
So, I got out a grenade.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.235
And I say, "Hey, man.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.738
"I'm new to skid row,
I just did a shitload of heroin,

10:04.772 --> 10:06.239
"and I need to take a nap.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.975
I'll find you a new tent."

10:08.008 --> 10:09.843
Basically the MS-13s were like,

10:09.877 --> 10:12.780
"Do you want to get jumped in
or sexed in?"

10:12.813 --> 10:16.283
And I had a girlfriend
at the time, so here we go.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.550
(grunts)

10:19.552 --> 10:21.789
-(applause) -Broadcasting live
from Los Angeles,

10:21.822 --> 10:26.193
I am book critic, radio host
and failed amateur gardener...

10:26.226 --> 10:29.096
-(laughter)
-Steeb Corniglia,

10:29.129 --> 10:32.165
and this is Tip of My Tongue.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.701
(cheering)

10:33.734 --> 10:37.838
I may have left
a trail of vegetable corpses

10:37.871 --> 10:39.973
in my wake,
but I am still qualified

10:40.007 --> 10:42.609
to introduce our special guests.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.644
Back with us is actor,

10:44.678 --> 10:47.047
writer and master improviser

10:47.080 --> 10:50.050
-Andy Daly.
-Oh, thank you, Steeb.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.319
Hey, is it true
that you had a restraining order

10:52.352 --> 10:54.888
placed on you
by a clutch of watercress?

10:54.922 --> 10:56.523
(laughter)

10:56.556 --> 10:59.292
Also, television writer
and comedienne

10:59.326 --> 11:01.895
-Emily Heller.
-If anyone brought legumes,

11:01.929 --> 11:04.732
please know that Steeb can't be
within 500 feet of them.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.566
-(laughter)
-STEEB: It's true.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.235
I bean a bad boy.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.470
-(laughter)
-And, finally,

11:10.503 --> 11:13.006
erotica writer
Jimmy Shive-Overly.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.842
(scattered applause)

11:14.875 --> 11:17.044
Thanks, Steeb. Uh, well,

11:17.077 --> 11:19.479
I hope they're not
serving carrots at crafty...

11:19.512 --> 11:21.314
Let's get started
with our first game:

11:21.348 --> 11:23.150
"Who's Steeb Right Now?"

11:23.183 --> 11:24.384
(applause)

11:24.417 --> 11:26.019
ANDY: Well, one thing
we know about Steeb

11:26.053 --> 11:28.822
is that he is a perpetrator
of hominy-cide.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.891
(laughter)

11:34.694 --> 11:36.529
* La, la, la

11:36.563 --> 11:38.265
* La, la, la, la

11:38.298 --> 11:42.069
(French accent): Everyone knows
that France is the best country.

11:42.102 --> 11:44.537
They basically won World War II,

11:44.571 --> 11:46.273
and they invented
the best type of kissing:

11:46.306 --> 11:48.776
tongue kissing.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.744
Their president
is a Benetton model

11:50.778 --> 11:52.612
who bangs his mom-wife.

11:55.548 --> 11:58.251
(music volume increases)

11:58.285 --> 12:01.588
(lip-synching):
* Mon petit chou

12:01.621 --> 12:04.792
* Mon petit chou

12:06.226 --> 12:09.029
* Mon petit chou,
chou bee doo bee doo bee doo *

12:09.062 --> 12:11.331
* Mon petit chou,
chou, chou bee doo *

12:13.066 --> 12:14.467
* Quand je vois ton sourire

12:14.501 --> 12:17.104
* Tes yeux, tes lèvres,
tes cheveux *

12:17.137 --> 12:18.939
* Oui, je sais

12:18.972 --> 12:20.908
* Que tu es le seul

12:20.941 --> 12:24.144
* Mon soleil, mon balance,
sans pareil *

12:24.177 --> 12:27.580
* Oui, c'est vrai

12:27.614 --> 12:31.318
* Tu es ce lui que j'adore

12:31.351 --> 12:34.221
* Tu seras toujours mon amour

12:34.254 --> 12:36.056
* Et c'est pourquoi

12:36.089 --> 12:37.557
* Je suis avec toi

12:37.590 --> 12:38.591
* Mon petit chou

12:38.625 --> 12:40.593
* Chou, chou bee doo

12:40.627 --> 12:42.162
* Mon petit chou...

12:43.997 --> 12:45.799
Oh! Thank you, Gretchen.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.134
-(music stops)
-Ah, the winner

12:47.167 --> 12:48.668
is Poland.
Way to go, sweetie!

12:48.701 --> 12:50.003
-Hooray!
-(claps)

12:50.037 --> 12:51.104
Are you kidding me?

12:52.205 --> 12:53.440
I-I'm not even done yet.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.175
I have a whole thing
with a baguette!

12:56.309 --> 12:58.611
This is bullshit!

13:05.986 --> 13:08.255
Which goes back to my original
point: don't open a bottle

13:08.288 --> 13:09.356
of Gruner Veltliner
with a first-chair oboist

13:09.389 --> 13:10.690
unless you want to end up

13:10.723 --> 13:13.493
in her laundry room,
peeing into her mop sink.

13:13.526 --> 13:14.527
(laughter)

13:15.963 --> 13:18.465
STEEB:
Okay. Our next game

13:18.498 --> 13:20.367
is "Limerick Lightning
Cage Match."

13:20.400 --> 13:22.936
I will read a limerick,
and you will complete it.

13:22.970 --> 13:25.005
Jimmy, let's start with you.

13:25.038 --> 13:28.341
"Astronomers chose
just to can it,

13:28.375 --> 13:29.877
"but the little guy's fans

13:29.910 --> 13:31.111
"couldn't stand it.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.846
"Now the stars have aligned,

13:32.880 --> 13:35.182
"and they're changing
their minds

13:35.215 --> 13:38.018
by returning its status to..."

13:41.421 --> 13:42.689
(woman coughs)

13:42.722 --> 13:44.457
Granite!

13:44.491 --> 13:45.692
(murmuring)

13:45.725 --> 13:47.327
Who paid you to throw this game?

13:47.360 --> 13:48.862
-(laughter)
-Emily?

13:48.896 --> 13:50.697
Planet, referring to Pluto,

13:50.730 --> 13:53.333
-of course.
-But granite was a great guess.

13:53.366 --> 13:54.634
I mean,
scientists can never tell

13:54.667 --> 13:56.003
when something
is made of granite.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.470
-(laughs) -They call it
their white whale.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.172
-(laughter)
-STEEB: Good point, Andy.

13:59.206 --> 14:00.874
So, ten points

14:00.908 --> 14:03.010
for Emily,
and negative five points

14:03.043 --> 14:05.312
-for our resident smut peddler.
-(laughter)

14:05.345 --> 14:08.882
Well, for your information,
this "smut peddler"

14:08.916 --> 14:11.751
is on New York Times Mass-Market
Paperback Best Seller list.

14:11.784 --> 14:14.321
Ooh. The Mass-Market list.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.722
-(laughter)
-What other books

14:15.755 --> 14:17.690
might one find on that list?

14:17.724 --> 14:20.760
Oh, uh,
How My Cat Cured My Cancer.

14:20.793 --> 14:22.562
-(laughter)
-Ooh, yes.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.264
American Ninja Warrior:
The Novel.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.865
-(laughter)
-The Life-Changing Magic

14:25.899 --> 14:28.168
of Throwing Some Things
in the Garbage.

14:28.201 --> 14:31.204
(laughs) What are we watching?

14:31.238 --> 14:33.106
I know a bunch
of the sounds they're saying,

14:33.140 --> 14:35.075
but I don't understand
the sentences.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.709
(laughs)

14:36.743 --> 14:39.012
ANDY:
Chicken Soup for the Stomach.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.680
EMILY:
The DiCaprio Code.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.050
Paul, I'm at a very important
Jimmy thing.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.918
PAUL (over phone):
Lindsay! I got arrested

14:44.952 --> 14:47.754
for biking under the influence.
(groans)

14:47.787 --> 14:50.723
Come bail me out,
Lindsay, please.

14:50.757 --> 14:53.593
-I need your help.
-You need my help?

14:53.626 --> 14:56.629
Or Angels Are Real, I Swear.

14:56.663 --> 14:57.764
-(laughs)
-How about

14:57.797 --> 14:59.632
uh, Shakespeare,
But With Vampires?

14:59.666 --> 15:02.269
Improve Your Memory
in Zero Easy Steps.

15:02.302 --> 15:03.570
(uproarious laughter)

15:03.603 --> 15:05.472
Or, uh...

15:05.505 --> 15:09.609
Killer, uh, B-Ballerinas.

15:09.642 --> 15:10.810
(laughs)

15:10.843 --> 15:12.879
(woman coughs)

15:12.912 --> 15:16.583
Well, that was a squeaker.

15:16.616 --> 15:17.884
(snoring)

15:17.917 --> 15:19.386
(woman clears throat)

15:19.419 --> 15:22.222
I said, that was a squeaker!

15:22.255 --> 15:24.124
-(scattered laughter)
-"Hey, Shive-Overly.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.558
"Why don't you try writing

15:25.592 --> 15:27.827
your own obituary
and then kill yourself?"

15:28.861 --> 15:31.498
"Jimmy Shive-Overly
died this week.

15:31.531 --> 15:34.734
His member was stiff, and soon,
so was the rest of his body."

15:34.767 --> 15:36.736
(laughter)

15:36.769 --> 15:38.171
Now, that's a squeaker.

15:38.205 --> 15:40.140
(laughter, applause)

15:42.275 --> 15:44.211
*

15:47.447 --> 15:49.249
BOONE:
Hi.

15:49.282 --> 15:52.019
What the hell is wrong with you?

15:52.052 --> 15:54.154
I don't know
how to act with her.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.656
I'm not her mom.
I'm not her friend.

15:56.689 --> 16:00.193
I'm trying to make this work.

16:00.227 --> 16:04.031
I feel like I'm supposed
to be good at this.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.799
Do you think I'm good at this?

16:06.833 --> 16:09.636
Last year I bought her a sword.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.504
I lost her at the mall

16:11.538 --> 16:13.473
because I was staring
at a Cinnabon too hard.

16:14.874 --> 16:16.943
Just be yourself, okay?

16:16.976 --> 16:19.012
I'm gonna order some pierogies.

16:19.046 --> 16:21.814
Come down and join us
when you're ready.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.287
EDGAR:
And so...

16:27.320 --> 16:29.322
since I still have shrapnel
in my body

16:29.356 --> 16:31.391
but I don't have insurance,
it's...

16:31.424 --> 16:33.860
it's kind of like
the memory of that day

16:33.893 --> 16:36.296
when I lost my best friend...

16:36.329 --> 16:39.032
is always inside me,

16:39.066 --> 16:41.234
between my colon
and my genitals.

16:41.268 --> 16:42.502
Whoa.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.504
I don't know what to say.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.206
My heart.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.876
-Thank you. Ah.
-Mm-hmm.

16:49.909 --> 16:51.744
That feels...

16:51.778 --> 16:54.614
really awesome
telling you my truth.

16:56.216 --> 16:58.151
Oh, shit.

16:58.185 --> 16:59.752
We missed the entire show.

16:59.786 --> 17:02.089
-(sighs) -Eh. I guess
we should get back to work.

17:02.122 --> 17:04.391
We still have to write
our sketch for this week.

17:04.424 --> 17:07.894
What if there's a dictator
who's a tater,

17:07.927 --> 17:10.330
but also a total dick?

17:10.363 --> 17:11.998
Actually,
I'm just gonna head home.

17:12.031 --> 17:15.235
But I feel so honored
that you shared that with me.

17:15.268 --> 17:16.636
(quietly):
Yeah.

17:19.106 --> 17:20.773
I'm sorry.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.775
Did I talk too long?

17:22.809 --> 17:25.478
No. That was a gift.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.415
Thank you.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.319
JIMMY (whispers):
Thank you.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.262
(Paul groaning)

17:42.295 --> 17:43.696
Lindsay...

17:43.730 --> 17:45.732
it wasn't my fault.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.901
The entire DUI industry is run

17:48.935 --> 17:51.070
by a for-profit organization

17:51.104 --> 17:53.706
called Mothers
Against Drunk Driving.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.908
They keep lowering
the legal limit

17:55.942 --> 17:58.145
so they can raise money

17:58.178 --> 18:02.081
to pay their huge
executive salaries.

18:03.350 --> 18:06.353
That's mothers for you.
(sputters)

18:09.689 --> 18:11.891
Wow, Linds.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.593
The smell, right?

18:13.626 --> 18:16.463
I know. I lost a rotisserie
chicken in here somewhere,

18:16.496 --> 18:18.265
and I can't find it anywhere.

18:19.366 --> 18:22.335
No, uh... I'm just impressed.

18:22.369 --> 18:25.272
You've really moved on.

18:27.807 --> 18:30.877
I was so excited
to be a father, Lindsay.

18:32.679 --> 18:36.082
I even... started a...

18:36.115 --> 18:38.351
video diary...

18:39.786 --> 18:42.155
...to welcome it into the world.

18:42.189 --> 18:45.124
Hi, baby.
This is entry number 47.

18:45.158 --> 18:47.960
Today we're gonna focus
on the constellation

18:47.994 --> 18:50.029
Auriga, the charioteer.

18:50.062 --> 18:52.599
-I'll take you to Mexico
to see it one day. -Mm.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.635
Hopefully, by then my stomach
will have adapted to the molé.

18:55.668 --> 18:58.471
I'm so sorry, Bear.

18:58.505 --> 19:01.308
You can still be a dad someday.

19:01.341 --> 19:04.311
You just need to find
the right...

19:04.344 --> 19:06.713
(snoring softly)

19:20.092 --> 19:21.661
What's the book about?

19:21.694 --> 19:24.797
Great Plains settlers in 1875.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.567
So interesting.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.370
What's going on
in the part you're reading?

19:30.403 --> 19:32.672
The settlers
don't have enough food,

19:32.705 --> 19:34.974
so the little girl's dog
runs away.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.377
Oh. Like Bus Stop Goat.

19:37.410 --> 19:41.814
-Who? -He's, like,
the greatest pet of Instagram.

19:41.848 --> 19:44.717
We DM all the time. Look.

19:46.219 --> 19:47.720
(ringtone playing)

19:47.754 --> 19:49.656
Oh, shoot.

19:49.689 --> 19:52.925
I forgot I have to go do
this thing with Ben Folds.

19:54.093 --> 19:55.428
Who's Ben Folds?

19:55.462 --> 19:57.797
Promise you'll never
repeat that in public.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.268
Okay. I'll see you later.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.607
(pats Olivia's back)

20:08.641 --> 20:11.177
(sighs, sniffs)

20:11.210 --> 20:13.646
(phone rings)

20:15.648 --> 20:17.083
Uh...

20:18.551 --> 20:20.953
-Hey, Doug.
-Edgar. Doug Benson.

20:20.987 --> 20:23.590
Quick call before I board
a flight to Davos.

20:23.623 --> 20:26.192
I'm hosting a forum
on building investor confidence

20:26.225 --> 20:28.461
in post-civil war Moldova.

20:28.495 --> 20:30.863
Wait. There's a civil war
in Moldova?

20:30.897 --> 20:32.432
Not yet,
but we're aiming for March.

20:32.465 --> 20:34.133
Listen, you're gonna be doing

20:34.166 --> 20:37.370
all the high-concept sketches
from now on.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.806
I'm moving Max over
to episode development.

20:39.839 --> 20:42.108
But you have my full confidence.

20:42.141 --> 20:43.776
Okay, got to run.

20:43.810 --> 20:46.446
Deep state never sleeps.

20:50.583 --> 20:54.086

-(indistinct chatter)

20:54.120 --> 20:55.655
Hey.

20:58.525 --> 21:00.927
I got your text.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.830
Uh, what he's having,
but a triple.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.565
-He's having a triple.
-Right.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.834
So make mine... nine.

21:10.470 --> 21:13.506
Sorry your dumb radio show
was mean to you.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.608
I thought I could be
the one writer

21:15.642 --> 21:17.844
to elevate the romance genre.

21:17.877 --> 21:20.913
Your book elevated the only
thing it needed to: my dick.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.181
(chuckles)

21:23.282 --> 21:25.618
And what's with the dress?

21:25.652 --> 21:28.655
Are you starting
a Serge Gainsbourg cover band?

21:28.688 --> 21:32.158
No, I just had to go to this
stupid thing in Eagle Rock.

21:32.191 --> 21:34.260
All things in Eagle Rock
are stupid.

21:34.293 --> 21:37.196
What was it, runny cheese
tasting at the Converse store?

21:37.229 --> 21:38.865
It's called international night,

21:38.898 --> 21:40.933
with that guy, Boone,
and his daughter.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.869
(phone chiming and vibrating)

21:42.902 --> 21:45.838
If you have to be somewhere...

21:45.872 --> 21:49.175
Mm, no.
I have this work thing, but...

21:49.208 --> 21:51.644
nobody will care
if I'm a little late.

22:02.589 --> 22:05.392
-WOMAN: I told you...
-Gretch, where are you?

22:05.425 --> 22:07.126
Ben's hella late.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.695
You said
this dude was professional.

22:08.728 --> 22:10.897
This was supposed
to be our big opportunity.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.699
Where is this fool?!

22:12.732 --> 22:16.235
Where are you?! Ugh!

22:16.268 --> 22:17.870
BEN FOLDS:
Hey, guys!

22:17.904 --> 22:19.472
SAM:
There he is.

22:19.506 --> 22:21.207
You ready to rock?

22:21.240 --> 22:24.076
I am indeed.

22:24.110 --> 22:27.046
Can I offer you boys
a tooch of rug?

22:27.079 --> 22:31.418
Rug? That doesn't sound right.

22:31.451 --> 22:33.420
Hey, Ben, are you...?

22:33.453 --> 22:36.188
-Holy shit!
-Holy shit!

22:36.222 --> 22:37.890
-Are you okay?
-Dude, your head!

22:37.924 --> 22:39.826
I'm fine.

22:39.859 --> 22:43.596
After the restaurant, I stayed
me had some couple Manhattan.

22:43.630 --> 22:44.897
And then blue drink.

22:44.931 --> 22:46.733
That was yesterday.

22:46.766 --> 22:49.335
Well, then why was I
in Griffith Park tomorrow?

22:49.368 --> 22:51.704
All right, let's do this.

22:51.738 --> 22:53.205
-All right. Uh, don't worry
about it. -Catfish vanilla?

22:53.239 --> 22:55.875
Who puts drinks on a piano?
Two, three, six.

22:55.908 --> 22:57.309
(bottles clinking,
rapid tapping on table)

22:58.945 --> 23:01.414
I can't hear it.
I can't hear it.

23:01.448 --> 23:03.215
It's in the key of E, guys.

23:03.249 --> 23:05.117
(bottles clinking,
rapid tapping continues)

23:05.151 --> 23:07.353
(phone chimes)

23:07.386 --> 23:09.556
(phone chiming, vibrating)

23:09.589 --> 23:12.258
I have to tell you something.

23:12.291 --> 23:14.527
I came by your house
the other day

23:14.561 --> 23:16.763
and saw you doing some chick
on the couch.

23:20.166 --> 23:22.535
So who was the nasty slizz?

23:22.569 --> 23:26.305
Uh, well, that was Katherine,
my old friend from home,

23:26.338 --> 23:28.575
but she's not nasty.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.545
I mean, boring, sure.

23:32.579 --> 23:34.747
She's unbearably annoying.

23:34.781 --> 23:38.284
Completely reeking
of unearned snobbery.

23:38.317 --> 23:40.753
-(laughing)
-She's an entertainment lawyer,

23:40.787 --> 23:42.722
that noble calling.

23:42.755 --> 23:45.324
(with British accent): That's
what John Adams was, wasn't he?

23:45.357 --> 23:46.959
-Ooh. Uh...
-(Gretchen laughs)

23:46.993 --> 23:48.427
Excuse me.
Is this chair free?

23:48.461 --> 23:50.162
-Does it look like it's free?
-Obviously my bag

23:50.196 --> 23:52.899
is sitting there, idiot.

23:52.932 --> 23:55.067
(Gretchen laughs)

23:55.101 --> 23:59.772
* Oh, why'd you do me so?

23:59.806 --> 24:01.641
(Gretchen moans)

24:01.674 --> 24:08.014
* Well, why'd you do me so?

24:09.782 --> 24:15.722
* Well, why'd
you do me so? *

24:17.289 --> 24:21.694
* Why'd you do me so?
