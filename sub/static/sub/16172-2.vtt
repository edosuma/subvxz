Once we're married, I won't

I understand.

08:12.615 --> 08:14.155
Zeki...

08:22.135 --> 08:24.346
What will we do to her?

08:25.654 --> 08:27.390
White woman hostage.

08:27.939 --> 08:29.393
She's valuable.

08:30.591 --> 08:32.450
I don't understand.

08:32.570 --> 08:33.775
"Valuable"?

08:35.902 --> 08:37.150
No, not to us.

08:37.188 --> 08:38.847
Non-believers are worth nothing.

08:39.986 --> 08:41.318
But to the world...

08:41.690 --> 08:43.703
they take notice cos we have a Brit.

08:44.769 --> 08:46.855
That's how the world notices us.

08:47.350 --> 08:49.259
We want the world to notice us?

08:49.281 --> 08:50.657
Do you want change?

08:53.243 --> 08:56.112
There's a lot of injustice
in this world, Zeki.

08:57.155 --> 08:59.225
Unless we fight back, then

08:59.552 --> 09:01.777
Muslim people, they're
going to be crushed...

09:02.105 --> 09:03.281

09:04.155 --> 09:05.829
People like you and me

09:06.583 --> 09:08.265
mustn't let that happen.

09:10.329 --> 09:11.716
I understand that.

09:12.926 --> 09:13.903
So,

09:14.957 --> 09:17.182
we have to show the
world that we are powerful

09:17.443 --> 09:19.019
and won't be crushed.

09:25.457 --> 09:27.155
I want to be like you, Abu.

09:28.155 --> 09:31.627
You're brave and you know
how to make the world listen.

09:31.838 --> 09:33.098

09:35.226 --> 09:37.076

09:38.053 --> 09:40.588
They can kill thousands of our
women and children, there's nothing.

09:40.589 --> 09:42.220
But one white woman?

09:43.841 --> 09:46.155

- It isn't fair.

09:46.748 --> 09:48.003

Yeah, you're ready to be a fighter.

09:52.542 --> 09:54.140
Ready to praise Allah.

10:46.649 --> 10:48.241
The situation has now escalated.

10:48.242 --> 10:50.562
We're soon to be joined
by Special Forces.

10:51.155 --> 10:52.659
They'll get their brief from MI5.

10:52.670 --> 10:54.967
Their aim will be to
recover the Primary.

10:55.155 --> 10:58.214
Now, I have no doubt that's
exactly what they'll do!

10:58.541 --> 11:01.344
We'll back up and support
Special Forces as and when.

12:18.963 --> 12:20.428
Not at the moment.

- Are you?

12:23.874 --> 12:25.689
Well, you're doing the opposite!

12:28.119 --> 12:29.634
I'm a medic. Help...

12:29.667 --> 12:32.155
You all need to leave our country alone.

12:34.744 --> 12:35.767
Yes, sir.

12:35.887 --> 12:37.596
We need our soldiers back.

12:38.275 --> 12:40.432

14:22.854 --> 14:25.403
You going to be all
right for this one, boss?

14:27.736 --> 14:29.687
Sorry, boss.

14:42.155 --> 14:43.783
Right, listen in, then.

14:44.366 --> 14:45.704
This is our Primary.

14:45.715 --> 14:48.361
From now on, I only want to hear
her referred to as the "Primary".

14:48.389 --> 14:50.742
- Has everybody synched that?
- ALL: Yes, boss.

15:06.557 --> 15:07.955
Have you seen it?

15:08.477 --> 15:10.930
- Indeed.
- I'm sorry, mate, this isn't happening.

15:11.107 --> 15:12.300
I'm on the wire to London,

15:12.311 --> 15:14.259
- they're going to have to find someone else.
- There isn't time.

15:14.265 --> 15:15.652
There's going to have to be.

15:15.835 --> 15:18.235
How can I possibly send YOU out on this.

15:18.238 --> 15:20.614
Because I'm a professional
and I can compartmentalise.

15:20.625 --> 15:21.784
No, you can't!

15:22.050 --> 15:23.543
It shouldn't be you, Elvis.

15:23.663 --> 15:25.280
- I should've vetoed it.
- Why would you have done that

15:25.296 --> 15:26.268
if you didn't know they
were going to send me?

15:26.279 --> 15:28.399
- Because I thought you were in Syria.
- We were.

15:28.676 --> 15:30.630
We did a tour. We got
back and this came in.

15:30.674 --> 15:31.917
Yeah, it shouldn't be you, Elvis,

15:31.933 --> 15:34.155
- and you fucking know it shouldn't.
- Yeah, well, it has to be me!

15:37.499 --> 15:38.970
- Please, Charlie.
- No.

15:39.331 --> 15:41.401
- You're too involved.
- Well, I'm here now...

15:42.422 --> 15:43.975

16:39.360 --> 16:42.308
and will be executed at sundown tomorrow

16:42.343 --> 16:45.262
if all Al-Shabaab
fighters are not released."

16:45.382 --> 16:48.155
When you encounter the
kuffar on the battlefield,

16:48.574 --> 16:52.286
cut off their heads until we
have thoroughly defeated them.

16:52.785 --> 16:54.672
You release our fighters...

16:56.187 --> 16:58.035
... or we cut off her head.

16:58.495 --> 17:01.155
VIDEO: 'When you encounter
the kuffar on the battlefield,

17:01.636 --> 17:05.271
cut off their heads until we
have thoroughly defeated them.

17:05.893 --> 17:07.800
You release our fighters...

17:08.406 --> 17:09.964
... or we cut off her head.'

17:12.155 --> 17:14.200
BBC's Al-Shabaab contact
hasn't heard anything

17:14.214 --> 17:15.737
since receiving the video.

17:16.402 --> 17:18.155
We're currently checking
in with Al Jazeera.

17:19.210 --> 17:20.266
They don't know she's a soldier,

17:20.278 --> 17:21.395
that's why they're keeping her alive.

17:21.730 --> 17:24.390
MI5 are trying to ascertain
the identity of the captor.

17:24.443 --> 17:25.829
And who is this bloke? Is he

17:25.949 --> 17:28.430
a white British convert? He sounds
like he's got a London accent to me.

17:28.448 --> 17:29.855
Intelligence are
checking to see if anyone

17:29.868 --> 17:31.746
fitting the bill has
slipped off the radar.

17:32.407 --> 17:33.704
Right, so sundown. That's still...

17:33.824 --> 17:36.092
We've got till 20.03 tomorrow.

17:36.096 --> 17:37.233
Are the lines open?

17:37.304 --> 17:39.550
Well, yes, but we don't
negotiate with terrorists.

17:39.581 --> 17:42.321
No, but we listen to their
demands to stall them, don't we?

18:09.794 --> 18:11.615
Are you OK?

18:16.664 --> 18:18.276
Where are we?

18:18.597 --> 18:20.548
Are we across the border?

18:25.155 --> 18:27.510
They don't know that
I'm in the military.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.657
They must never know that,
Kicki. Do you understand?

18:30.777 --> 18:36.541
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH, HE SHOUTS IN SOMALI

18:55.412 --> 18:56.886
What are you doing?

18:57.479 --> 18:59.354
Hiding my dog tags.

19:02.456 --> 19:04.820
I'm going to make us
survive this, Kicki.

19:06.640 --> 19:08.344
Why don't they know you're a soldier?

19:08.410 --> 19:11.241
Because they took me from a
Kenya Crisis Care ambulance.

19:12.184 --> 19:13.832
So, they think you work with me?

19:13.893 --> 19:15.097
Kicki,

19:15.613 --> 19:18.582
if they knew that I was a
soldier, they'd behead me.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.784
We've got until 8 o'clock tonight!

19:39.064 --> 19:40.682
When are they going to
throw us a bone!? Seriously,

19:40.710 --> 19:43.024
- do something to speed them up, Charlie!
- Soon as you get some intel,

19:43.064 --> 19:44.606
you'll be on your way.

19:45.064 --> 19:46.532
SHOWER PATTERS

19:46.554 --> 19:48.646
- I'm getting Georgie back safe, mate.
- (Fuck's sake!)

19:50.472 --> 19:51.338
What?

19:51.360 --> 19:53.369
- Have you got a clear head for this one?
- I've told you, I have!

19:53.424 --> 19:55.899
Then she's the "Primary".
And this mission is textbook.

19:55.971 --> 19:57.547
I don't want to hear of
you being Billy Big-Bollocks

19:57.580 --> 19:59.899
- and giving it James Bond.
- "James Bond"?

20:00.121 --> 20:01.345
I'm serious.

20:01.803 --> 20:03.720
- Do you understand?
- Yes!

20:03.840 --> 20:06.792
Molly is in Afghan,
mentoring, now that you ask.

20:06.841 --> 20:08.158
Good. Glad to hear
she's doing all right.

20:08.165 --> 20:09.448
She's still putting up with you anyway!

20:09.504 --> 20:11.363
Well, she loves me, Elvis, so...

20:11.613 --> 20:13.319
Poor deluded fool...

20:13.770 --> 20:15.781
- How's your folks?
- Bath.

20:16.107 --> 20:18.916
Still mithering on. Yours?

20:19.256 --> 20:21.954
Same old, still deeply disappointed
I'm travelling the world,

20:21.961 --> 20:23.279
doing what I do... killing people.

20:23.314 --> 20:25.291
- Is that how they see Special Forces, is it?
- Yeah.

20:25.340 --> 20:27.157
Actually, I make them right.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.904
You know when I get her back,
I'm explaining everything.

20:31.132 --> 20:32.845
You broke her heart, mate.

20:33.345 --> 20:35.425
Then it's my duty to
mend it, then, innit.

20:38.456 --> 20:39.399
WATER STOPS

20:39.462 --> 20:40.717
HE THUDS

20:40.773 --> 20:42.888
(Fuck's sake!)

20:43.970 --> 20:46.571
WATER SPLASHES, ELVIS GASPS

20:48.007 --> 20:49.499
I knew that was going
to be cold, as well!

20:49.512 --> 20:51.586
That should help get
your head in the game.

20:58.738 --> 21:00.674
And I'm getting her back, Charlie!

21:00.958 --> 21:02.643
Nice tattoo.

21:02.872 --> 21:03.989
What?

21:04.398 --> 21:06.345
Well, good luck with that, mate.

21:09.455 --> 21:10.981
Are you OK?

21:13.567 --> 21:15.348
They're just going to kill us,

21:15.468 --> 21:16.945
aren't they?

21:16.994 --> 21:18.344
FAINT BUZZING

21:18.345 --> 21:19.983
What?

21:20.469 --> 21:22.134
Can you hear... ?

21:23.729 --> 21:25.505
I thought I heard a buzz.

21:25.706 --> 21:27.308
BUZZING FROM ABOVE

21:27.428 --> 21:29.327
I can! Can you hear that?

21:29.834 --> 21:31.575
- BUZZING CONTINUES
- What is it?

21:32.678 --> 21:34.641
That's the sound of them looking for us.

21:34.761 --> 21:36.056
Who?

21:38.505 --> 21:41.099
They've got a drone scouring the area.

21:41.155 --> 21:42.660
For us?

21:43.617 --> 21:45.407
They're not just going to abandon us.

21:45.608 --> 21:46.933
Really?

21:47.231 --> 21:49.090
You really think
they're going to find us?

21:49.132 --> 21:51.719
Yeah. These drone things are, like, mad.

21:51.782 --> 21:54.029
As in brilliant.

21:54.522 --> 21:56.201
How do you know?

21:57.235 --> 21:58.879
I, um,

21:59.345 --> 22:01.258
I was once stuck...

22:01.861 --> 22:05.156
... in a ruin on a hillside in Afghan.

22:05.975 --> 22:07.409
I was a medic

22:07.529 --> 22:09.971
on a mission with the Special Forces.

22:18.009 --> 22:19.744
And, um,

22:19.771 --> 22:23.345
our vehicle went over an IED.

22:25.564 --> 22:27.776
So, er, me and the boss

22:27.839 --> 22:30.079
dragged the casualty into the ruin

22:30.345 --> 22:33.749
<i>and covered the entrance as
best we could with rocks...</i>

22:34.394 --> 22:38.345
<i>... and I could see the
Taliban coming towards us... </i>

22:42.488 --> 22:44.909
We were what we call
"technically fucked".

22:45.457 --> 22:48.439
I understand that one. SHE CHUCKLES

22:49.764 --> 22:51.908
Well, I dressed the
wound the best I could,

22:52.858 --> 22:54.571
and um...

22:58.636 --> 23:01.140
... and he was screaming for his mum

23:01.188 --> 23:03.443
and I had to basically gag him...

23:03.811 --> 23:06.322
... so the Taliban couldn't hear him

23:06.668 --> 23:08.881
and we could extend our lives for, like,

23:09.001 --> 23:10.671
an extra five minutes.

23:11.628 --> 23:14.042
But the officer commanding was, um,

23:14.943 --> 23:17.426
was, like, whistling
this tune and fiddling...

23:17.447 --> 23:20.617
fiddling with something.
Not a care in the world.

23:21.158 --> 23:22.959
And I looked at him and I thought

23:23.079 --> 23:25.258
"Has he, like, gone mad?"

23:25.521 --> 23:26.874
And, um...

23:27.644 --> 23:30.252
He looked at me, smiled and said...

23:35.025 --> 23:37.085
I'm getting you out of here, Georgie.

23:41.102 --> 23:42.926
I'm getting you out of here.

23:43.196 --> 23:45.749
<i>The boss had got his infrared device out</i>

23:46.290 --> 23:48.565
<i>and he was signalling to the drone</i>

23:48.850 --> 23:50.625
through a hole in the rocks.

23:51.139 --> 23:52.623
He's amazing.

23:52.658 --> 23:54.676
He was so calm.

23:54.961 --> 23:56.528
I'd given up.

23:56.986 --> 23:58.908
Lost two men in my charge,

23:59.345 --> 24:00.989
third dying...

24:01.759 --> 24:03.340
The fourth...

24:03.534 --> 24:06.121
- The officer commanding...
- Yeah.

24:07.558 --> 24:10.700
Well, without him, I
wouldn't be here, that's true.

24:11.345 --> 24:13.391
It's nice to see your eyes light up...

24:13.405 --> 24:14.778
Hm?

24:14.993 --> 24:17.330
... when you talk about this officer.

24:17.899 --> 24:19.696
SHE SCOFFS

24:19.816 --> 24:22.832
They're lighting up because
I'm remembering the situation...

24:22.852 --> 24:26.074
- Hmm(!)
- It taught me to never give up.

24:26.345 --> 24:28.280
Nothing about Elvis.

24:34.461 --> 24:36.140
What happened to him?

24:38.921 --> 24:40.565
He went off...

24:43.000 --> 24:44.741
... on another mission...

24:49.894 --> 24:51.455
Al-Shabaab compound.

24:51.476 --> 24:54.438
Drone picked up activity
in the last 24 hours.

24:54.701 --> 24:56.172
Current situation?

24:56.186 --> 24:58.294
Kenyan close surveillance
are monitoring.

24:58.414 --> 25:01.922
Strong possibility hostages are in situ.

25:02.042 --> 25:04.697
Occasional visits from lone Al-Shabaab.

25:04.817 --> 25:07.237
And these are the only
Al-Shabaab working this area?

25:07.264 --> 25:08.555
Yes.

25:08.797 --> 25:10.650
Let's get down on the
ground and examine.

25:10.692 --> 25:12.585
Charlie, have you got those coordinates?

25:18.099 --> 25:20.049
We've got till 20.03!

25:22.414 --> 25:26.345
HE SINGS CALL TO PRAYER

25:40.628 --> 25:43.345
SINGING

25:48.813 --> 25:50.345
He's gone.

25:52.125 --> 25:54.143
I make it we've got ten minutes.

25:56.097 --> 25:57.619
This is madness.

25:57.739 --> 25:58.966
Stop, Georgie.

25:58.988 --> 26:01.979
We need to find where we are.
They'll be looking for us.

26:03.505 --> 26:05.014
It is better to just wait.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.990
No, we've got no TIME to wait.

26:07.345 --> 26:09.548
Look, I wish we had,
Kicki! But these people,

26:10.524 --> 26:12.966
they're irrational, all right?

26:13.345 --> 26:14.879
CLANKING

26:14.906 --> 26:16.689
We need to get the hell out of here.

26:16.809 --> 26:18.923
PRAYER CONTINUES IN DISTANCE

26:19.103 --> 26:21.920
METALLIC CLANKING

26:22.040 --> 26:24.916
[SHE GRUNTS] I need your help.

26:25.513 --> 26:27.476
I've got no more fight left in me.

26:27.596 --> 26:29.390
SHE CLANKS

26:29.510 --> 26:31.804
Yes, you have, Kicki!

26:31.846 --> 26:33.559
Yes, you have!

26:33.989 --> 26:36.345
We're saving ourselves, all right?

26:37.693 --> 26:40.502
We've got a hell of a
lot more life to live.

26:41.563 --> 26:45.344
- Come on. Come on. Up.
- Yes.

26:45.740 --> 26:48.383
CLANKING

26:52.773 --> 26:55.461
- Thank you.
- I haven't done anything.

26:55.581 --> 26:57.043
You trusted me

26:57.321 --> 26:58.902
and sometimes that's all that matters.

26:58.916 --> 27:01.345
METAL GROANS AND CLANKS

27:02.655 --> 27:04.694
CLANG!

27:52.918 --> 27:53.989
What do we do?

27:54.109 --> 27:55.443
We get out of the compound and hide

27:55.448 --> 27:56.974
until we see friendly forces.

28:00.302 --> 28:02.294
WHISPERING: Kicki! Kicki!

28:02.516 --> 28:04.995
Now, listen, you wait here.
If you see anyone coming,

28:05.029 --> 28:05.983
warn me,

28:06.016 --> 28:08.003
go to the back of the
cell block, all right?

28:08.123 --> 28:09.651
Kicki... Kicki!

28:09.668 --> 28:11.610
You will be telling your
grandkids about this, I promise.

28:11.632 --> 28:13.430
Go! Go! Go! Go!

28:13.641 --> 28:15.728
PRAYER CONTINUES FAINTLY

29:08.342 --> 29:10.728
She was here, chaps. I'm
pretty certain of that.

29:11.190 --> 29:13.019
Since been moved on.

29:15.412 --> 29:17.352
I'm going to try and get
a tracker on the vehicle.

29:17.378 --> 29:18.461
All right, boss.

29:18.581 --> 29:20.495
I'm guessing it's going back
to wherever they've got her...

29:20.504 --> 29:21.649
the Primary.

29:46.525 --> 29:47.868
We need to go!

29:48.706 --> 29:51.536
- What's the point of this?
- Knowledge is power, Kicki.

29:51.747 --> 29:53.301
No-one ever told you that?

30:16.525 --> 30:18.123
All clear, good to go.

30:24.174 --> 30:26.108
All eyes on me.

30:34.732 --> 30:36.640
Tracker on vehicle.

30:39.596 --> 30:43.645
Alpha One, vehicle and
two tango's inbound.

30:50.779 --> 30:52.799
Zero Alfa do not engage.

30:53.082 --> 30:55.807
Repeat, do not engage,
remain out of sight.

30:56.013 --> 30:57.483
If we kill 'em there's no fucker

30:57.516 --> 30:59.231
to take this truck back
to where they're holed up.

30:59.669 --> 31:01.495
Hopefully with the Primary.

31:11.391 --> 31:13.830
This tracker's leaving here!
Has everyone roger-ed that?

31:13.858 --> 31:16.538
- Alfa One acknowledged.
- Alfa Two acknowledged.

31:16.560 --> 31:18.813
Alfa Three acknowledged.

31:23.146 --> 31:24.855
Boss, we're going to need to break cover

31:24.866 --> 31:28.701
- or you're going to be pancaked.
- Do not engage. Wait out!

31:50.043 --> 31:53.053
Good work, fellas.
Owe you a beer or five.

32:04.628 --> 32:06.336
Georgie!

32:06.456 --> 32:09.822
Georgie! The praying has stopped.

32:10.490 --> 32:13.369
Let's go! Come on.

32:27.007 --> 32:28.914
Get down.

32:29.287 --> 32:30.883
They're going to kill us.

32:30.917 --> 32:32.680
We'll stay here until
we get an opportunity.

32:32.707 --> 32:34.005
What opportunity?

32:34.033 --> 32:35.308
Night fall, the next prayer call,

32:35.309 --> 32:37.051
then we're going to make our escape.

32:38.112 --> 32:39.812
Oi. Hey.

32:40.207 --> 32:41.726
We're getting out of here, OK?

32:41.740 --> 32:44.369
100%, I'm getting you
back to the refugee camp.

32:44.563 --> 32:45.666
OK?

32:45.992 --> 32:47.615
Get down.

32:50.981 --> 32:53.209
Tracker heading due east.

33:04.359 --> 33:06.288
Where's that signal, Spunks?

33:06.408 --> 33:08.142
Got it, sir.

33:11.757 --> 33:13.397
3km due east.

33:13.517 --> 33:16.085
Stationary. Must be at their base.

33:16.517 --> 33:17.744
Let's move.

33:30.104 --> 33:32.003
Find them.

33:57.543 --> 33:59.624
And now I kill you.

34:01.517 --> 34:03.456
We do it at sundown.

34:04.939 --> 34:07.115
Give them time to release our men.

34:07.462 --> 34:10.792
If not, then you can kill them.

34:12.092 --> 34:14.433
Lock them up and secure the door.

34:22.592 --> 34:24.214
Sundown.

34:24.873 --> 34:27.431
Keeping us alive is a braver thing.

34:27.951 --> 34:31.109
Alive, we're worth something.
Dead, we're worth nothing.

34:35.271 --> 34:37.324
Look, please...

34:37.685 --> 34:40.723
- Please, we can stop all this now.
- We'll never stop.

34:41.306 --> 34:44.087
That's what you can't
understand, you in the west.

34:44.437 --> 34:47.139
- In the west?
- Fucking UK, then.

34:48.206 --> 34:49.359
What... ?

34:49.560 --> 34:52.362
- You don't see yourself British at all?
- Britain?

34:52.382 --> 34:54.270
That's just soil. Land.

34:54.516 --> 34:56.545
People thinking it's something special.

34:57.011 --> 34:58.086
Bullshit.

34:58.148 --> 35:00.582
- Everywhere's just soil.
- But not Muslim lands.

35:00.586 --> 35:02.157
They exist because of us...

35:02.578 --> 35:04.054
us Muslims.

35:04.737 --> 35:06.530
And the Americans and Brits and Israelis

35:06.546 --> 35:08.671
think it's fun to bomb God out of us.

35:09.517 --> 35:11.697
That can never happen.
Can it? Think about it!

35:12.346 --> 35:13.839
You can't bomb God!

35:14.577 --> 35:16.192
Fucking idiots!

35:16.764 --> 35:18.107
What about your family?

35:20.814 --> 35:21.996
What do you mean?

35:22.279 --> 35:23.544
Well...

35:24.243 --> 35:25.492
Must hurt,

35:25.669 --> 35:27.229
you not been able to convert them?

35:27.349 --> 35:29.143
No, they were too stubborn.

35:30.364 --> 35:32.593
I'm sure they don't want to
see their boy die in this war.

35:32.624 --> 35:34.517
It's paradise! But they won't listen!

35:35.443 --> 35:37.276
The Prophet Muhammad said
that everyone will see God

35:37.303 --> 35:38.497
on the Day of Resurrection,

35:38.517 --> 35:40.840
as easily as one can see the
sun when there are no clouds.

35:40.854 --> 35:43.331
There will be no sickness,
pain, sadness or death there.

35:43.344 --> 35:45.808
The Prophet Muhammad said that
there are things in Paradise

35:45.928 --> 35:48.290
that no eye has seen, no ear has heard

35:48.303 --> 35:49.732
- and no human mind has thought of...
- So all your family

35:49.750 --> 35:51.827
- are going to go in the fire? Yeah!
- All non believers.

35:53.030 --> 35:55.397
I will chop your head off

35:56.816 --> 35:58.778
because I know the
paradise that awaits me.

35:58.818 --> 36:01.188
SHE GASPS

36:03.314 --> 36:04.330
Where are you from?

36:04.543 --> 36:05.777
You sound northern.

36:06.448 --> 36:07.624
Manchester.

36:08.517 --> 36:10.475
That place is drowning in sin.

36:11.101 --> 36:12.326
You from London?

36:12.517 --> 36:14.517
Ah, soon I'll be from Islamic Somalia.

36:16.069 --> 36:17.365
How do you know about Manchester?

36:17.444 --> 36:18.874
It is sinful.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.556
You are sinful.

36:26.763 --> 36:30.049
Stop here. Signal stationary.

36:37.991 --> 36:39.768
Shit.

36:41.517 --> 36:43.397
"Shit" is right.

36:43.948 --> 36:45.397
Listen, they can't have gone that far.

36:45.409 --> 36:47.479
Spunky, call in a drone,
let's get some eyes on.

36:47.517 --> 36:49.876
Hello Zero, this is Zero Alfa, over.

36:59.517 --> 37:01.517
SHOUTING

37:09.734 --> 37:11.182
What?

37:11.797 --> 37:13.774
They're still looking for us.

37:17.774 --> 37:20.163
They haven't given up, so
we're not giving up either.

37:22.517 --> 37:24.724
- Where the hell did you get that?
- Stole it

37:24.980 --> 37:26.644
from the ops room.

37:26.716 --> 37:28.131
Up there for thinking!

37:29.929 --> 37:31.517
What use is it to us?

37:32.221 --> 37:33.902
In case they give us a telly.

37:35.517 --> 37:36.665
It's infra red.

37:37.847 --> 37:40.150
The drone should pick it up.
Anyone with half a brain cell

37:40.161 --> 37:42.020
watching the footage
will know it's a signal.

37:42.140 --> 37:43.718
From a remote control?

37:43.762 --> 37:45.122
I know!

37:45.242 --> 37:46.759
It's amazing.

37:50.400 --> 37:51.449
Right.

37:51.465 --> 37:54.334
I need you to get me up there.

38:00.888 --> 38:01.870
That's it.

38:02.436 --> 38:04.162
Are we ever gonna get out of here?

38:04.282 --> 38:05.510
We don't need to.

38:06.176 --> 38:07.281
This does.

38:11.517 --> 38:12.988
What do you think?

38:15.008 --> 38:16.517
Has to be a signal!

38:19.930 --> 38:21.063
What is it?

38:22.145 --> 38:23.397
There was a compound...

38:23.399 --> 38:26.185
a couple of years ago, we
raided and closed it down.

38:26.395 --> 38:27.577
Here!

38:28.793 --> 38:30.413
What, you think the signal
could be coming from there?

38:30.441 --> 38:33.032
Hm! Checking coordinates from the drone.

38:38.021 --> 38:39.517
Pretty good match.

38:41.611 --> 38:44.697
- She's managed to get a signal from there?
- Hm, yeah!

38:46.029 --> 38:47.183
I tell you what, you
have to hand it to her...

38:47.194 --> 38:48.581
She's a bloody survivor!

38:49.718 --> 38:53.147
Primary at grid 256901890.

38:53.169 --> 38:55.762
- Compound north-east of your location, over.
- Roger that.

38:55.882 --> 38:57.936
James, we're doing this stealth on foot.

38:57.953 --> 38:59.501
Prepare to launch operational circle.

38:59.517 --> 39:01.377
Once we've confirmed
Primary exact location, over.

39:01.399 --> 39:02.397
Roger that.

39:02.443 --> 39:05.140
Phase one, air support goes
in and softens the captors,

39:05.312 --> 39:08.031
phase two, paras with two
section infantry support

39:08.053 --> 39:11.011
attack the gate, phase
three, that's you, Elvis.

39:11.131 --> 39:12.654
- Over.
- Roger.

39:19.706 --> 39:21.022
They've gone.

39:23.092 --> 39:24.790
They didn't spot us, did they?

39:25.922 --> 39:27.225
They'll never give up.

39:28.613 --> 39:29.872
Understand that.

39:31.517 --> 39:32.941
- Really?
- Hmm hmm.

39:34.671 --> 39:36.580
I'm going home and getting married.

39:37.517 --> 39:38.711
Really?

39:40.164 --> 39:41.796
Don't sound too surprised!

39:44.865 --> 39:46.014
I love him.

39:46.996 --> 39:49.404
He's everything that I could ever want.

39:51.158 --> 39:53.178
Someone proposed to me once.

39:54.255 --> 39:55.708
What happened?

39:58.517 --> 40:01.102
I was going to say, "Yes." Honestly.

40:01.163 --> 40:03.348
I opened my mouth to say "yes"

40:04.447 --> 40:06.067
and "no" came out.

40:07.088 --> 40:08.517
Leo Ekbert.

40:08.637 --> 40:10.517
He sat in front of me at school.

40:11.517 --> 40:13.126
I was right to say "no"

40:13.492 --> 40:15.013
for Leo's sake.

40:19.286 --> 40:21.716
- When I was at university...
- Ah.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.325
I fear what's coming...

40:24.363 --> 40:26.011
for Leo's sake.

40:26.356 --> 40:28.026
- There was this guy...
- Yes.

40:28.037 --> 40:30.823
So many stories start off like that.

40:31.517 --> 40:33.320
He introduced me to Africa.

40:35.384 --> 40:37.715
He was working for a news agency.

40:38.186 --> 40:39.346
Journo?

40:40.007 --> 40:41.517
War photographer.

40:42.648 --> 40:44.516
He was going out to Sierra Leone.

40:44.517 --> 40:46.427
He'd got a contact
who'd arranged a meeting

40:46.439 --> 40:47.904
with the West Side Boys,

40:47.920 --> 40:50.240
a militia who were ruthless.

40:50.517 --> 40:53.725
He was so excited and somehow...

40:54.874 --> 40:56.428
I said "no" to Leo

40:56.548 --> 40:58.031
in order to get away.

40:59.075 --> 41:00.540
Africa!

41:01.261 --> 41:03.517
I could go and be his assistant.

41:04.169 --> 41:05.134
Was it... ?

41:05.254 --> 41:07.397
Was it Africa or him you wanted?

41:07.517 --> 41:09.950
Him, without a doubt.

41:14.134 --> 41:15.610
And then...

41:16.719 --> 41:18.517
the bastards shot him.

41:20.271 --> 41:23.323
I ended up being looked
after by people from an NGO.

41:23.977 --> 41:26.236
Worked in West Africa before, erm,

41:26.356 --> 41:28.539
getting a permanent placement in Kenya.

41:29.111 --> 41:30.517
You didn't go home?

41:33.190 --> 41:34.810
Africa became my home.

41:41.341 --> 41:43.517
Nafula can carry on my work.

41:53.599 --> 41:55.041
Right, guys, we're part of phase two.

41:55.064 --> 41:57.195
Op serpent, in support of the para's.

41:57.378 --> 41:59.271
Phase one is an air strike, phase two,

41:59.304 --> 42:00.680
we launch at attack.

42:00.752 --> 42:02.816
Phase three, the Special Forces go in

42:02.833 --> 42:04.503
and rescue the Primary.

42:04.931 --> 42:06.650
Now this is as dangerous a mission

42:06.651 --> 42:08.472
as we've ever undertaken together.

42:08.677 --> 42:12.018
To reiterate, once the Primary
is confirmed at the compound,

42:12.045 --> 42:15.486
phase one air strike,
then phase two, we attack.

42:15.606 --> 42:17.429
Right. Let's move.

42:20.231 --> 42:22.167
Let's make this a moment to remember,

42:22.217 --> 42:23.738
not one we want to forget.

42:23.976 --> 42:24.975
Let's go!

42:38.517 --> 42:40.857
Tell you what, they're looking
a bit switched off, chaps.

42:41.312 --> 42:44.132
Should see them, there's no chance
this place being compromised.

42:44.252 --> 42:46.269
There's no-one guarding
the perimeter, either.

42:46.280 --> 42:47.883
What you thinking, boss?

42:47.900 --> 42:49.137
I'm thinking I get in,

42:49.165 --> 42:50.813
confirm Primary presence
and get out again

42:50.835 --> 42:53.239
before these fuckers have had
time to finish their cornflakes.

42:53.300 --> 42:56.008
- Keep the net clear.
- Shall we call it in, boss?

42:56.128 --> 42:57.145
No!

42:57.407 --> 43:00.071
- Need to know basis.
- Boss, you ain't going in there alone.

43:00.110 --> 43:01.747
Remind me of our job again?

43:11.884 --> 43:13.592
Roger, out.

43:45.517 --> 43:47.134
Compound reached.

43:47.254 --> 43:49.203
Stand by for confirmation
of Primary presence

43:49.225 --> 43:51.223
and prepare to launch
phase one. Wait out.

43:51.343 --> 43:53.137
Is he actually in there?

43:54.419 --> 43:57.471
Please confirm your exact location.

43:57.755 --> 44:00.573
Repeat, confirm your location.

44:18.716 --> 44:20.453
MAN SHOUTS

44:22.650 --> 44:23.743
Zeki?

44:24.881 --> 44:27.323
- You mustn't talk to me.
- Zeki, please.

44:28.199 --> 44:30.347
Please. We need some water.

44:31.079 --> 44:33.221
- Your governments...
- We're here in Kenya

44:33.243 --> 44:35.290
helping your people. Families

44:35.410 --> 44:38.104
like yours. We're
against our governments.

44:39.373 --> 44:40.755
Zeki, please.

44:41.310 --> 44:42.764
You can help us.

44:43.517 --> 44:44.955
But I'm not in charge.

44:45.075 --> 44:47.014
No, but you're a nice person.

44:48.512 --> 44:50.416
- Am I?
- Yeah.

44:51.825 --> 44:53.251
You've been kind to us

44:54.173 --> 44:56.013
and I know you don't want to kill us.

44:56.014 --> 44:57.668
But we want our country back.

44:58.378 --> 45:01.252
And we have a duty to Allah.

45:01.696 --> 45:02.928
You're a good boy.

45:04.965 --> 45:06.446
Is your mother proud?

45:07.450 --> 45:08.582
Yes.

45:09.021 --> 45:11.096
She'll want you back safe.

45:12.971 --> 45:14.517
She wants me to...

45:16.362 --> 45:17.755
Zeki, look.

45:18.049 --> 45:19.475
It's all right,

45:20.047 --> 45:21.545
I can look after you.

45:22.671 --> 45:25.357
You're a good person
and I know that. But...

45:27.638 --> 45:29.774
I'm not sure Abu is.

45:30.662 --> 45:32.016
He is a fighter.

45:32.971 --> 45:35.584
The rest are not worth
the dirt from his boots.

45:35.962 --> 45:37.182
He's willing to die

45:37.393 --> 45:39.147
- for our cause.
- Yeah.

45:39.829 --> 45:41.911
Yeah, this week, maybe.
What about next week?

45:41.983 --> 45:44.208
He's been with us for three months now!

45:44.674 --> 45:46.289
You don't understand!

45:46.783 --> 45:48.531
Zeki, please.

45:49.309 --> 45:50.563
Please just...

45:51.706 --> 45:53.687
Just get my friend some water.

45:54.403 --> 45:55.517
Please.

46:46.159 --> 46:47.867
Georgie.

46:54.659 --> 46:56.516
Primary confirmed alive.

46:56.517 --> 46:59.771
Repeat, alive. Second hostage in situ.

47:00.611 --> 47:03.524
Launch phase one. Standby!

47:06.517 --> 47:08.654
I'm getting you out of here, George.

47:18.635 --> 47:21.264
Spunky, en-route back
to your location, over.

47:21.312 --> 47:24.905
- Boss over?
- Microphone directed at the Primary.

47:37.059 --> 47:39.251
Do the guards on the
gate have eyes on us?

47:40.561 --> 47:42.070
Negative, boss.

47:53.517 --> 47:55.304
Did we say give them water?

47:55.342 --> 47:56.517
No, leader.

47:57.573 --> 47:58.939
In 20 minutes,

47:58.994 --> 48:00.609
we make your final video.

48:04.071 --> 48:05.109
You!

48:05.517 --> 48:07.134
Do not let them talk.

48:07.151 --> 48:08.533
Yes, leader.

48:17.034 --> 48:19.150
Right, listen in, we need to move now.

48:20.859 --> 48:23.119
Extraction point by
helicopter one click.

48:23.146 --> 48:24.841
- You fit?
- It's been said, Spunk.

48:25.486 --> 48:27.705
Listen, I've had eyes on the
Primary and one other hostage.

48:29.250 --> 48:30.517
She's alive, boys.

48:33.165 --> 48:34.306
Zeki, please.

48:34.630 --> 48:36.881
All right? You can help us. I know
that you don't want to kill us.

48:36.921 --> 48:40.394
- They haven't returned our fighters.
- They will do, I promise you. Please.

48:46.014 --> 48:47.150
What are these? WHAT ARE THESE?!

48:48.856 --> 48:50.112
WHAT ARE THESE?!

48:52.709 --> 48:54.570
Give me. Give me 'em back.

48:54.601 --> 48:56.731
- Give them to me!
- What are these?

48:57.348 --> 48:58.844
They're my boyfriend's, in the UK.

48:59.368 --> 49:00.611
- These are yours!
- No,

49:00.633 --> 49:03.657
they're not real, they're fake
from Camden Market. Please.

49:04.069 --> 49:05.024
She works for me.

49:05.033 --> 49:08.158
- Stop talking!
- Zeki, Zeki, you're my friend, all right.

49:08.517 --> 49:10.475
I can tell the way
you look at me. Please.

49:10.640 --> 49:13.450
- You don't want to kill like the others.
- You're army?

49:14.063 --> 49:15.253
Zeki, you know,

49:15.799 --> 49:18.311
after this, we can be friends.

49:18.627 --> 49:21.220
- Friends?
- Yeah. Zeki, please...

49:21.340 --> 49:23.227
- Please give me them back. Please.
- Abu!

49:23.280 --> 49:26.122
- Please, please.
- Abu! Abu! They're soldiers, Abu!

49:26.130 --> 49:29.220
Abu! They're soldiers, Abu!

49:32.770 --> 49:34.972
<i>Abu, they're soldiers!</i>

49:35.016 --> 49:38.307
Abu, they're soldiers! Abu! Abu!

49:38.795 --> 49:40.851
She's been compromised! Let's go!

49:47.733 --> 49:49.517
Lance Corporal Georgie Lane!

49:49.749 --> 49:51.098
You've done well, Zeki.

49:51.271 --> 49:52.470
You're a man.

49:52.843 --> 49:54.081
A soldier.

49:56.189 --> 49:57.263
You...

49:58.276 --> 49:59.517
You're our prize.

50:01.237 --> 50:02.640
Are you a soldier too?

50:02.720 --> 50:04.238
Are you?! No, no.

50:05.113 --> 50:06.516
Please. Please.

50:07.950 --> 50:09.588
Are you a soldier too?

50:10.756 --> 50:12.517
You knew she was a soldier!

50:14.517 --> 50:15.221
Kill her.

50:16.047 --> 50:18.392
You deserve to be called
a fighter, now kill her.

50:18.395 --> 50:19.336
On your knees.

50:19.531 --> 50:21.871
- ON YOUR KNEES!
- She's in... She's innocent.

50:22.124 --> 50:23.495
Please! Please!

50:24.161 --> 50:26.340
Kicki! Zeki! Please!

50:27.001 --> 50:29.922
She's innocent. Please, Zeki!

50:45.075 --> 50:46.832
Shot fired! We need to move!!

50:46.837 --> 50:48.680
- Are we getting air support?
- No time!

50:48.685 --> 50:49.623
Nine minutes out.

50:49.640 --> 50:52.109
There's already one hostage
possibly shot. Let's go!

50:57.609 --> 50:58.918
It's OK.

50:59.038 --> 51:01.332
Paradise is waiting for you, my friend.

51:04.650 --> 51:06.831
- Now kill the other infidel.
- No,

51:06.951 --> 51:08.196
we wait.

51:09.228 --> 51:12.413
We film her death so that
the British can watch her die.

51:24.604 --> 51:25.724
James!

51:26.535 --> 51:28.688
James! Repeat, Primary compromised.

51:28.693 --> 51:30.280
Launch phase two. Now!

51:30.319 --> 51:31.578
Go now?

51:31.939 --> 51:34.664
Please confirm not waiting
out for phase one air strike.

51:34.784 --> 51:38.226
Repeat, Primary compromised.
Launch phase two. Go!

51:38.271 --> 51:41.101
Both teams prepare to
move to position alpha.

51:41.162 --> 51:42.344
Move!

51:56.517 --> 51:59.286
- Am I dying?
- No!

51:59.320 --> 52:01.004
No, you're gonna be fine.

52:01.059 --> 52:03.549
- You're gonna be fine.
- SHE COUGHS

52:03.945 --> 52:06.206
GUNSHOTS AND SHOUTS

52:06.326 --> 52:08.245
Can you hear that? Eh?

52:08.301 --> 52:11.540
They're coming to save
us. Listen. They're coming.

52:11.660 --> 52:14.474
Tell Nafula to stay strong.

52:14.517 --> 52:16.576
She needs you back, fit and well. Ey!

52:16.696 --> 52:18.636
We all do. Kicki.

52:22.333 --> 52:23.561
She can do it.

52:24.551 --> 52:26.243
She must never give in.

52:26.363 --> 52:29.014
No. You! You must never give in.

52:29.025 --> 52:31.196
You must never give in, OK? I need you,

52:31.316 --> 52:35.297
Kicki. I need you. We all
need you. I need you. Please.

52:35.846 --> 52:38.166
Look, look. They're coming to rescue us.

52:41.062 --> 52:42.305
Like I said,

52:42.988 --> 52:44.264
Kicki.

52:44.517 --> 52:45.884
I said...

52:46.200 --> 52:48.303
I said they were coming, didn't I?

52:49.685 --> 52:52.094
I said it, Kicki.

52:55.474 --> 52:58.237
Please, Kicki.

53:04.585 --> 53:06.458
Gate breached.

53:06.500 --> 53:10.419
Man down. Contact! Engage now.

53:10.446 --> 53:12.517
They're attacking the gates!

53:12.839 --> 53:16.314
- Leader, they're attacking the gates.
- You're a soldier now, Zeki.

53:16.342 --> 53:17.965
Stay and fight.

53:18.180 --> 53:21.322
Abu? What about me, Abu?

53:21.517 --> 53:23.223
Your brothers are fighting!

53:23.417 --> 53:26.254
Be prepared to die, yeah?
Paradise awaits you, brother.

53:26.906 --> 53:28.793
Praise be to Allah!

53:38.247 --> 53:39.933
King, on me.

53:45.080 --> 53:48.070
Fingers, Brains, enemy
behind vehicle now.

54:39.029 --> 54:40.517
Zeki?!

54:50.748 --> 54:52.361
Down!

55:01.861 --> 55:03.890
She's dead!

55:05.043 --> 55:08.207
MUSIC PLAYS

55:48.511 --> 55:49.951
This is Zero Alpha.

55:49.994 --> 55:52.510
Extraction complete, Primary recovered.

55:52.537 --> 55:55.520
Repeat, Primary recovered.

55:58.261 --> 56:00.307
All is well in the world.

56:26.991 --> 56:29.516
- Why him, boss?
- It wasn't my call, Lane.

56:29.517 --> 56:32.449
Those boys who rescued you,
they know what they're doing.

56:32.721 --> 56:35.496
- But maybe I need to talk to you.
- Yeah, well maybe I'm not listening.

56:35.517 --> 56:37.500
Let's try and find out
who the convert Abu is

56:37.517 --> 56:39.397
and identify the rest of his cell.

56:39.415 --> 56:41.479
We need to get him before he gets us.

56:42.189 --> 56:44.259
That's Gaani. He's the Cell Commander.
