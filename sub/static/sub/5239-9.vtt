00:04.947 --> 00:07.073
<i>Previously on</i> Blunt Talk...

00:07.108 --> 00:09.776
It's the Falklands all over again, Harry.

00:09.828 --> 00:11.327
- The anniversary of the Falklands
is coming up.- Hey!

00:11.363 --> 00:13.780
And that... no, that is when
you and Harry really go nuts.

00:13.832 --> 00:15.498
- Who's Harry?
- Major.

00:16.785 --> 00:18.418
Don't leave me!

00:18.453 --> 00:20.787
I saw what that boy has between his legs.

00:20.789 --> 00:24.207
- I am genuinely attracted to you.
- You are?

00:24.259 --> 00:26.125
I glanced at you in the men's room.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.794
You're not circumcised.

00:27.846 --> 00:31.047
I haven't had sex since the 20th century.

00:31.099 --> 00:32.849
- Phil, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

00:32.884 --> 00:34.100
<i>My thing is
to wear no underwear.</i>

00:34.135 --> 00:35.551
<i>Then I ride the bus</i>

00:35.604 --> 00:39.555
and I just hope somebody
sees my noodle and my wontons.

00:39.608 --> 00:43.526
- You don't remember writing this
because you didn't.- I'm sorry?

00:43.561 --> 00:46.980
So what are you, breast man or an ass man?

00:47.032 --> 00:48.648
<i>I'm a foot man.</i>

00:48.700 --> 00:50.984
I don't get
it. Who is this idiot?

00:51.036 --> 00:53.152
It's Moby.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.621
<i>You dating Moby-Dick?</i>

00:54.656 --> 00:58.491
It's just Moby, no Dick, and, yes, I am.

01:13.642 --> 01:16.259
- Morning, Harry.
- Morning, Major.

01:16.311 --> 01:18.728
- Sleep all right?
- Oh, yes.

01:18.763 --> 01:21.931
So good to be sleeping in the open air.

01:25.687 --> 01:29.355
And, you know, I had quite an erotic dream.

01:29.357 --> 01:31.157
Burt Lancaster again, sir?

01:31.192 --> 01:33.276
Oh, certainly not. No.

01:33.328 --> 01:36.946
My dream was about Death Sentence Suzanne.

01:36.998 --> 01:39.365
It was somewhat carnal.

01:39.367 --> 01:40.700
Excellent news, sir.

01:40.702 --> 01:43.503
Oh, that night with her, Harry.

01:43.538 --> 01:45.588
It was one to remember.

01:45.623 --> 01:47.123
Yes, sir.

01:47.175 --> 01:49.125
Thank you.

01:49.177 --> 01:51.594
Her hair fanned out on the pillow.

01:51.629 --> 01:54.430
And that night, I experienced

01:54.466 --> 01:56.966
a total erasure of self,

01:57.018 --> 01:59.052
which so rarely happens.

01:59.104 --> 02:00.603
I wouldn't know, sir.

02:00.638 --> 02:05.024
Oh, no, of course. Oh, your issues.

02:05.060 --> 02:09.895
Well, a good orgasm,
Harry, is like a comet.

02:09.948 --> 02:11.731
It begins in the pelvis,

02:11.733 --> 02:14.233
shoots up the spine like a flame,

02:14.235 --> 02:16.369
sears across the mind,

02:16.404 --> 02:18.654
culminating in a red explosion

02:18.707 --> 02:21.908
followed quickly by a black void.

02:21.960 --> 02:27.080
So a red comet, sir, and then a black void?

02:27.082 --> 02:28.715
But, the black void

02:28.750 --> 02:32.168
could be an intimation of death.

02:32.220 --> 02:34.087
Right.

02:34.089 --> 02:35.421
Your eggs, sir.

02:35.423 --> 02:37.557
Oh, thank you, Harry.

02:38.760 --> 02:42.762
You know, it's hard to believe

02:42.764 --> 02:46.432
it's been 33 years since the war ended.

02:46.434 --> 02:48.568
It's still so vivid, sir.

02:48.603 --> 02:51.821
- I close my eyes, I'm there.
- Mm-hmm.

02:51.856 --> 02:55.575
You know, Major, we've never
really talked about the war.

02:55.610 --> 02:59.996
I mean, the scars that are unseen.

03:00.031 --> 03:02.081
Yes, I know.

03:03.785 --> 03:06.953
Walter, Red, do I smell bacon?

03:06.988 --> 03:09.505
Morning, Ronnie. Would you like a coffee?

03:09.541 --> 03:11.457
Oh, don't encourage him, Harry.

03:11.459 --> 03:14.260
Oh, yeah. Great. I'll be
right over. Just one sec.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.295
Oh. Great.

03:16.347 --> 03:18.965
Sorry, sir.

03:24.889 --> 03:26.305
I'd say thank God it's Friday,

03:26.357 --> 03:28.224
but I'm an atheist.

03:28.276 --> 03:30.610
I'm agnostic, but I do pray a lot.

03:30.645 --> 03:33.146
Yeah, me, too. I don't know what
else to do when I get scared.

03:34.866 --> 03:36.899
Hey, are you gonna go to Walter's party?

03:36.951 --> 03:39.152
Of course. He wants everyone to go.

03:39.154 --> 03:40.987
Are you bringing anybody?

03:40.989 --> 03:43.623
No, I want Walter to completely reform

03:43.658 --> 03:45.374
his opinion of me as an oversexed woman.

03:45.410 --> 03:46.993
- Right.
- Here's your report, Celia.

03:46.995 --> 03:50.496
Oh, thank you. Are you bringing anyone?

03:50.498 --> 03:52.832
Uh, no.

03:52.834 --> 03:56.219
No, I'm probably just
gonna leave early, you know?

03:56.254 --> 03:58.387
- Why?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

03:58.423 --> 04:00.723
It seems like every time I go to a party,

04:00.758 --> 04:04.560
somebody accidentally spits
their food into my mouth.

04:04.596 --> 04:06.512
- Come on.
- <i>I'm not kidding.</i>

04:06.564 --> 04:08.598
I'm like a... a Venus flytrap.

04:08.650 --> 04:12.401
A lot of times the other person
knows they spat in my mouth,

04:12.437 --> 04:14.520
but we pretend it didn't happen.

04:14.522 --> 04:16.355
Ugh, that's terrible.

04:16.357 --> 04:20.159
Yeah, last party I didn't
even bother eating my own food.

04:20.195 --> 04:22.912
Well, if you stick with
me, I won't eat anything

04:22.947 --> 04:24.914
and I won't spit in your mouth.

04:24.949 --> 04:26.532
Okay. Promise?

04:28.453 --> 04:30.203
All right.

04:30.255 --> 04:33.372
So, what are you two doing?

04:33.374 --> 04:35.842
A little World War II cosplay?

04:35.877 --> 04:37.009
Cosplay?

04:37.045 --> 04:39.762
You know, role playing with costumes, huh?

04:39.797 --> 04:41.597
Don't be disgusting.

04:41.633 --> 04:43.549
No, Ronnie, let me explain.

04:43.551 --> 04:47.220
We do this every few years on
the anniversary of the Falklands

04:47.222 --> 04:50.022
to celebrate the bloody
war coming to an end.

04:50.058 --> 04:53.025
Oh, I get it. A camping party.

04:53.061 --> 04:55.061
You should have invited me.

04:55.063 --> 04:57.647
I was a Boy Scout, if you can believe it.

04:57.699 --> 05:01.067
I got my first badge in
tossing salad.

05:01.119 --> 05:04.070
Well, we're having a proper party tonight.

05:04.072 --> 05:07.657
- Perhaps you'd like to come.
- Sure, and I'll bring Sylvia.

05:07.709 --> 05:09.709
She still asks about you, you know.

05:09.744 --> 05:12.128
- She does?
- Mmm.

05:14.999 --> 05:17.216
What are you doing?

05:17.252 --> 05:19.919
Push ups. I want to
look buff for the party.

05:19.971 --> 05:22.471
I can't believe how fast
you've become bisexual.

05:22.507 --> 05:23.839
I know.

05:23.892 --> 05:25.758
So you think you're gonna meet somebody?

05:25.760 --> 05:29.395
Maybe. I'm feeling very lush.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.814
Open. What about you?

05:31.849 --> 05:33.983
- Oh, I'm bringing a date.
- You're dating?

05:34.018 --> 05:36.769
I thought you were going on
vacation to find yourself.

05:36.821 --> 05:38.571
You can date before a vacation.

05:38.606 --> 05:40.489
Is Rosalie okay with this?

05:40.525 --> 05:41.607
Well, she's gonna bring Teddy.

05:41.609 --> 05:43.609
But it might be weird

05:43.611 --> 05:46.529
'cause the girl I met
is also named Rosalie.

05:46.581 --> 05:48.447
It's why I noticed her on Facebook.

05:48.499 --> 05:51.117
- Ew. Morning, Walter.
- Morning.

05:51.119 --> 05:53.452
Walter, Dr. Weiss is in your office.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.421
Damn. I'd forgotten.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.623
Uh, wait here, Harry.

05:57.625 --> 06:00.092
- Work on your knitting.
- Yes, Major.

06:01.679 --> 06:04.013
<i>Well done, Shelly.</i>

06:04.048 --> 06:06.382
Bet you'd make an excellent arm wrestler.

06:06.434 --> 06:07.850
- Really?
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

06:07.885 --> 06:09.635
Arm wrestling is a passion of mine,

06:09.687 --> 06:13.472
and I know who's good and who isn't.

06:15.610 --> 06:18.945
Yeah, Shelly. Yeah, you have value.

06:18.980 --> 06:21.364
Yeah, you're a good girl.

06:21.399 --> 06:23.282
Come on, Shelly.

06:26.487 --> 06:27.820
Hey.

06:27.822 --> 06:29.538
Morning, sir.

06:29.574 --> 06:32.124
Jim. You can call me Jim.

06:32.160 --> 06:33.659
Yes, sir.

06:33.711 --> 06:36.579
Hey, uh, Harry, what
are you always knitting?

06:36.631 --> 06:38.414
What is this?

06:38.466 --> 06:40.249
It's a hat for the major.

06:40.301 --> 06:43.302
Being bald, he's vulnerable to drafts.

06:43.338 --> 06:45.504
That's nice of you.

06:45.556 --> 06:49.008
Harry, I... I think it's beautiful,

06:49.060 --> 06:51.894
but why are you so devoted to Walter?

06:51.929 --> 06:54.847
I mean, I know he deserves it, but...

06:54.899 --> 06:56.565
But it seems excessive?

06:56.601 --> 07:00.186
- Well...
- It's not.

07:00.238 --> 07:02.521
33 years ago,

07:02.573 --> 07:05.191
the Major saved my life.

07:05.193 --> 07:08.694
I'd taken shrapnel and
would have bled to death

07:08.746 --> 07:10.946
slowly,

07:10.999 --> 07:13.783
which is not a pretty way to go.

07:15.119 --> 07:17.119
- I didn't... I didn't know.
- Yeah.

07:17.171 --> 07:19.403
He risked his life to save mine.

07:20.131 --> 07:25.376
So the least I can do,
Jim, knit him a hat..

07:26.014 --> 07:29.966
The truth is, Doctor,
for all the sex I've had,

07:30.018 --> 07:34.187
there have been very few
moments of profound happiness.

07:34.222 --> 07:35.689
What holds you back?

07:35.724 --> 07:38.975
I don't want to reveal myself.

07:38.977 --> 07:42.979
I live in public, but...

07:43.031 --> 07:46.950
oh, I have secrets. The war.

07:46.985 --> 07:48.785
<i>Look, can we talk
about something else?</i>

07:48.820 --> 07:52.072
I've never heard you
expound on my anal anxiety.

07:54.793 --> 07:58.328
Walter. Gardner wants
to see you in his office.

07:58.380 --> 08:00.163
We're in session.

08:04.336 --> 08:08.421
Is that little minx gonna be at your party?

08:08.473 --> 08:11.808
Gardner wants you to replace
your Falklands editorial

08:11.843 --> 08:15.145
because while you were
in session with Dr. Nutso,

08:15.180 --> 08:18.314
an Indiana congressman called Jeff Roberts

08:18.350 --> 08:21.101
was exposed by a male prostitute.

08:21.153 --> 08:25.572
Roberts was supportive of all
the anti-gay legislation there.

08:25.607 --> 08:27.073
Oh, God.

08:27.109 --> 08:29.659
That is the oldest story there is.

08:29.694 --> 08:32.028
The self-hating, closeted politician.

08:32.080 --> 08:35.749
Well, it's a huge story
and we have to cover it.

08:35.784 --> 08:38.251
Oh, Bob, we were just coming to you.

08:38.285 --> 08:41.587
Yeah, I'm not walking enough according
to my app, so I decided to sprint over.

08:41.623 --> 08:43.123
- Rosalie tell you?
- Yes.

08:43.174 --> 08:45.041
I do not want <i>Blunt Talk</i> involved

08:45.093 --> 08:48.178
in another one of these
tired tabloid witch-hunts.

08:48.213 --> 08:51.514
Uh-uh, this is a plane crash.
This is a sex plane crash

08:51.550 --> 08:53.433
and your numbers have started
to dip since your sex scandal.

08:53.468 --> 08:57.353
- But my Falklands editorial...
- No, this is important to me.

08:57.389 --> 09:00.223
It's very important.

09:00.225 --> 09:02.976
I'll see you at the party.
Looking forward to it.

09:03.028 --> 09:05.361
And Daddy is bringing a date.

09:06.698 --> 09:08.114
- Whoo.
- Damn it.

09:08.150 --> 09:10.733
I hate covering these kinds of things.

09:10.735 --> 09:14.904
I have felt the noose of public
shaming too often of late.

09:14.906 --> 09:16.406
So tell them that.

09:16.458 --> 09:19.459
Say you're sick of all
this puritanical bullshit.

09:19.494 --> 09:20.827
I know I am.

09:20.879 --> 09:22.662
So what Congressman Roberts

09:22.714 --> 09:25.081
stood for is reprehensible,

09:25.133 --> 09:28.918
but what he did in the
privacy of a hotel room is not.

09:28.920 --> 09:32.922
I, for one, would love to see a
day when there would be no judgment

09:32.924 --> 09:36.092
and no labels for what consenting adults do

09:36.094 --> 09:39.846
when being sensual in their private lives.

09:39.898 --> 09:42.148
No straight or gay or bi or trans.

09:42.184 --> 09:45.985
Just human beings in their endless variety.

09:46.021 --> 09:48.822
None more wrong or right than the next.

09:48.857 --> 09:51.741
Well, one can dream.

09:51.776 --> 09:53.943
So that's all we have for tonight,

09:53.945 --> 09:57.113
which happens to be the 33rd anniversary

09:57.115 --> 09:59.833
of the end of the Falklands War.

09:59.868 --> 10:02.285
May those fallen...

10:02.337 --> 10:04.420
...on both sides

10:04.456 --> 10:06.122
rest in peace.

10:07.459 --> 10:09.175
That was a lovely editorial, sir.

10:09.211 --> 10:12.795
Oh, Harry, it was pie in the sky dreaming.

10:12.848 --> 10:14.931
I sounded like John Lennon.

10:14.966 --> 10:17.967
Except that John was talking about peace.

10:18.019 --> 10:20.136
You're very gloomy today, sir.

10:20.188 --> 10:21.971
But let's try to rally.

10:21.973 --> 10:23.857
We have a party to throw.

10:23.892 --> 10:26.609
And, well, I have a gift for you.

10:30.482 --> 10:32.482
Ah.

10:32.484 --> 10:33.900
What is it, Harry?

10:33.952 --> 10:35.735
Oh, a tea cozy.

10:35.787 --> 10:37.737
No, it's a hat, sir.

10:37.789 --> 10:39.405
For drafts.

10:39.457 --> 10:42.625
Right. Thank you so much. I'll try it on.

10:46.548 --> 10:51.384
I seem to have misjudged the
dimensions of your skull, sir.

10:54.256 --> 10:56.839
Well, thank you all for coming.

10:56.892 --> 11:01.010
I am so heartened and delighted
to see each one of you here.

11:01.012 --> 11:04.764
Now, when we think on the Falklands War,

11:04.816 --> 11:08.184
we can be heartened to
know that today marks

11:08.236 --> 11:12.355
the day when hostilities ceased.

11:12.357 --> 11:14.824
So, let's...

I'm not good at drinking
games. You go first.

13:46.978 --> 13:49.645
Okay, I don't like
watching other people eat.

13:49.681 --> 13:52.014
I feel like they look like sort of animals

13:52.067 --> 13:53.399
and then I feel bad for judging them.

13:53.435 --> 13:55.184
Me, too. I watch them eat

13:55.186 --> 13:58.020
and then I'm picturing them on the toilet

13:58.073 --> 14:01.190
pooping later and it makes me sick.

14:01.192 --> 14:03.609
It's like hot dog in, hot dog out.

14:03.661 --> 14:06.028
Ew, yeah. I don't take it that far.

14:06.030 --> 14:08.531
Drink up.

14:08.583 --> 14:09.782
Mm.

14:09.834 --> 14:11.868
Get us more drinks.

14:11.870 --> 14:16.005
Okay, but what I said wasn't
that different from what you said.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.291
Two more drinks. Get whiskey.

14:18.343 --> 14:21.094
He was like, "That's definitely a ghost."

14:21.129 --> 14:23.629
Oh, Jim, this is Hershel.

14:23.681 --> 14:25.598
- He's a friend of Walter's.
- Oh, hey, man.

14:25.633 --> 14:28.384
Hey, nice to meet you.
How do you know Walter?

14:28.436 --> 14:30.553
He's my sex and love addicts sponsor.

14:30.605 --> 14:33.055
He don't return calls,
but he's a really nice...

14:33.057 --> 14:35.391
oh, shit, I just spit in your mouth.

14:35.393 --> 14:37.727
I am so sorry. I hate when that happens.

14:37.779 --> 14:41.697
It's okay. I'm just gonna
get a drink and wash it down.

14:41.733 --> 14:43.900
- Are you okay? I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

14:43.952 --> 14:46.319
It was just a little piece of hot dog, Jim.

14:47.739 --> 14:50.072
I put hot dogs in my mouth all the time.

14:52.210 --> 14:53.576
Stan, what the hell are you doing?

14:53.628 --> 14:55.461
You're my guest here tonight.

14:55.497 --> 14:57.630
I feel more comfortable
behind the bar, Mr. Blunt.

14:57.665 --> 15:01.217
- Usual?
- Yes, thanks, Stan. You're too kind.

15:01.252 --> 15:03.052
- Oh, hi.
- How you doing?

15:03.087 --> 15:06.672
- Can I get a vodka soda and a water, please?
- Sure.

15:06.724 --> 15:08.558
You sure you're okay with Moby DJing?

15:08.593 --> 15:11.260
Yes, I accept your relationship.

15:11.312 --> 15:14.814
Mr. and Mrs. Blunt.
Thank you for having me.

15:14.849 --> 15:17.517
I've never socialized with
parents of my students before.

15:17.569 --> 15:19.435
Oh, well, I hope it's
not too inappropriate.

15:19.487 --> 15:22.071
Oh, it might be, but I like it.

15:22.106 --> 15:23.489
It's an honor to meet you.

15:23.525 --> 15:25.274
As a producer of high-end erotica,

15:25.326 --> 15:27.276
I am also against genital mutilation.

15:27.278 --> 15:30.112
If you don't mind, I'd rather
not talk shop at a party.

15:30.165 --> 15:33.032
- Yeah.
- Hey, have you guys seen Celia?

15:33.084 --> 15:34.784
No.

15:34.836 --> 15:37.787
- You know what I mean?
- Yes. Finally, some...

15:37.789 --> 15:39.455
you know, look, when it comes to sex

15:39.507 --> 15:41.174
it's like I'm spinning a roulette wheel.

15:41.209 --> 15:43.342
I mean, I've tried every
perversion at least once.

15:43.378 --> 15:46.295
For years I was a sub then a cross-dresser.

15:46.347 --> 15:47.513
And now I'm an exhibitionist.

15:47.549 --> 15:50.299
Oh, my God, I love how open you are.

15:50.301 --> 15:52.218
You know, I came here
hoping to meet a girl,

15:52.270 --> 15:54.303
but I am happy to meet an open guy.

15:54.305 --> 15:57.023
Well, I mean, for me,
straight sex is the kinkiest.

15:57.058 --> 15:59.475
I mean, intimacy between a man and a woman?

15:59.477 --> 16:02.144
- Mm-hmm.
- Affection, kissing?

16:02.197 --> 16:05.448
Whoo, ain't that some sick action.

16:05.483 --> 16:06.949
- Yeah.
- You know what?

16:06.985 --> 16:09.902
- To straight sex.
- To straight sex.

16:11.203 --> 16:13.487
Thanks, Jim. I need a fresh one.

16:13.489 --> 16:16.206
Uh, no, that was for Celia.

16:16.242 --> 16:19.660
So why are you going on the
Appalachian Trail for your vacation?

16:19.712 --> 16:22.129
I just need to walk and think

16:22.164 --> 16:24.798
and, mm, figure out my life.

16:24.834 --> 16:26.467
I mean, I'm almost 28.

16:26.502 --> 16:29.219
- Hello, Martin.
- Rosalie.

16:29.255 --> 16:32.005
Uh, Rosalie, this is Rosalie.

16:32.058 --> 16:34.007
- What?
- I know, it's weird.

16:34.060 --> 16:36.393
You're only the third
other Rosalie I've ever met.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.979
Well, it's very nice to meet you.

16:39.014 --> 16:41.432
Any friend of Martin's is a friend of mine.

16:41.484 --> 16:44.234
Uh, you two have fun now, okay?

16:44.270 --> 16:47.404
Actually, we're going to go,

16:47.440 --> 16:49.990
but is all this okay?

16:50.025 --> 16:52.743
Of course, darling. Mwah.

16:52.778 --> 16:55.112
- It's fine.
- Okay.

<i>Hey, is everything all right?</i>

17:13.382 --> 17:16.133

17:19.888 --> 17:20.938
Hey, man.

17:23.025 --> 17:26.527
As a musician, you must have
had a lot of success with women.

17:26.561 --> 17:29.062
At one time, yes.

17:29.064 --> 17:32.533
- I peaked in 1988.
- Oh, I see.

17:32.568 --> 17:35.903
Well, the Major described a good orgasm

17:35.955 --> 17:39.490
like a red comet followed by a black abyss.

17:39.542 --> 17:41.208
Was that your experience?

17:41.243 --> 17:42.743
That's not how I'd put it.

17:42.795 --> 17:45.746
For me it was like a pitcher of water

17:45.798 --> 17:48.582
you pour off a high balcony.

17:48.584 --> 17:51.301
In Paris.

17:51.337 --> 17:53.887

17:53.923 --> 17:55.088

18:01.013 --> 18:02.763

18:02.815 --> 18:05.599

Major and are not welcome here.

18:26.622 --> 18:29.456

18:36.465 --> 18:38.465

if we could be friends...

19:51.874 --> 19:54.541
They lubricate their throats with Vaseline.

19:54.543 --> 19:56.063
How do they get the Vaseline in there?

get too drunk at parties.

20:12.061 --> 20:13.977
And I was born with a small tail,

20:14.029 --> 20:17.314
but my parents had it snipped off.

20:17.366 --> 20:18.732
You tell me something.

20:18.784 --> 20:20.784
That's gonna be hard to top.

Uh, okay. Um...

sometimes when I'm writing a
piece for the show at my desk,

20:31.664 --> 20:33.880
I get nervous and then I'll look down

20:33.916 --> 20:36.333
