<i>Previously on</i> Blunt Talk...

00:07.108 --> 00:09.776
It's the Falklands all over again, Harry.

00:09.828 --> 00:11.327
- The anniversary of the Falklands
is coming up.- Hey!

00:11.363 --> 00:13.780
And that... no, that is when
you and Harry really go nuts.

00:13.832 --> 00:15.498
- Who's Harry?
- Major.

00:16.785 --> 00:18.418
Don't leave me!

00:18.453 --> 00:20.787
I saw what that boy has between his legs.

00:20.789 --> 00:24.207
- I am genuinely attracted to you.
- You are?

00:24.259 --> 00:26.125
I glanced at you in the men's room.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.794
You're not circumcised.

00:27.846 --> 00:31.047
I haven't had sex since the 20th century.

00:31.099 --> 00:32.849
- Phil, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

00:32.884 --> 00:34.100
<i>My thing is
to wear no underwear.</i>

00:34.135 --> 00:35.551
<i>Then I ride the bus</i>

00:35.604 --> 00:39.555
and I just hope somebody
sees my noodle and my wontons.

00:39.608 --> 00:43.526
- You don't remember writing this
because you didn't.- I'm sorry?

00:43.561 --> 00:46.980
So what are you, breast man or an ass man?

00:47.032 --> 00:48.648
<i>I'm a foot man.</i>

00:48.700 --> 00:50.984
I don't get
it. Who is this idiot?

00:51.036 --> 00:53.152
It's Moby.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.621
<i>You dating Moby-Dick?</i>

00:54.656 --> 00:58.491
It's just Moby, no Dick, and, yes, I am.

01:13.642 --> 01:16.259
- Morning, Harry.
- Morning, Major.

01:16.311 --> 01:18.728
- Sleep all right?
- Oh, yes.

01:18.763 --> 01:21.931
So good to be sleeping in the open air.

01:25.687 --> 01:29.355
And, you know, I had quite an erotic dream.

01:29.357 --> 01:31.157
Burt Lancaster again, sir?

01:31.192 --> 01:33.276
Oh, certainly not. No.

01:33.328 --> 01:36.946
My dream was about Death Sentence Suzanne.

01:36.998 --> 01:39.365
It was somewhat carnal.

01:39.367 --> 01:40.700
Excellent news, sir.

01:40.702 --> 01:43.503
Oh, that night with her, Harry.

01:43.538 --> 01:45.588
It was one to remember.

01:45.623 --> 01:47.123
Yes, sir.

01:47.175 --> 01:49.125
Thank you.

01:49.177 --> 01:51.594
Her hair fanned out on the pillow.

01:51.629 --> 01:54.430
And that night, I experienced

01:54.466 --> 01:56.966
a total erasure of self,

01:57.018 --> 01:59.052
which so rarely happens.

01:59.104 --> 02:00.603
I wouldn't know, sir.

02:00.638 --> 02:05.024
Oh, no, of course. Oh, your issues.

02:05.060 --> 02:09.895
Well, a good orgasm,
Harry, is like a comet.

02:09.948 --> 02:11.731
It begins in the pelvis,

02:11.733 --> 02:14.233
shoots up the spine like a flame,

02:14.235 --> 02:16.369
sears across the mind,

02:16.404 --> 02:18.654
culminating in a red explosion

02:18.707 --> 02:21.908
followed quickly by a black void.

02:21.960 --> 02:27.080
So a red comet, sir, and then a black void?

02:27.082 --> 02:28.715
But, the black void

02:28.750 --> 02:32.168
could be an intimation of death.

02:32.220 --> 02:34.087
Right.

02:34.089 --> 02:35.421
Your eggs, sir.

02:35.423 --> 02:37.557
Oh, thank you, Harry.

02:38.760 --> 02:42.762
You know, it's hard to believe

02:42.764 --> 02:46.432
it's been 33 years since the war ended.

02:46.434 --> 02:48.568
It's still so vivid, sir.

02:48.603 --> 02:51.821
- I close my eyes, I'm there.
- Mm-hmm.

02:51.856 --> 02:55.575
You know, Major, we've never
really talked about the war.

02:55.610 --> 02:59.996
I mean, the scars that are unseen.

03:00.031 --> 03:02.081
Yes, I know.

03:03.785 --> 03:06.953
Walter, Red, do I smell bacon?

03:06.988 --> 03:09.505
Morning, Ronnie. Would you like a coffee?

03:09.541 --> 03:11.457
Oh, don't encourage him, Harry.

03:11.459 --> 03:14.260
Oh, yeah. Great. I'll be
right over. Just one sec.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.295
Oh. Great.

03:16.347 --> 03:18.965
Sorry, sir.

03:24.889 --> 03:26.305
I'd say thank God it's Friday,

03:26.357 --> 03:28.224
but I'm an atheist.

03:28.276 --> 03:30.610
I'm agnostic, but I do pray a lot.

03:30.645 --> 03:33.146
Yeah, me, too. I don't know what
else to do when I get scared.

03:34.866 --> 03:36.899
Hey, are you gonna go to Walter's party?

03:36.951 --> 03:39.152
Of course. He wants everyone to go.

03:39.154 --> 03:40.987
Are you bringing anybody?

03:40.989 --> 03:43.623
No, I want Walter to completely reform

03:43.658 --> 03:45.374
his opinion of me as an oversexed woman.

03:45.410 --> 03:46.993
- Right.
- Here's your report, Celia.

03:46.995 --> 03:50.496
Oh, thank you. Are you bringing anyone?

03:50.498 --> 03:52.832
Uh, no.

03:52.834 --> 03:56.219
No, I'm probably just
gonna leave early, you know?

03:56.254 --> 03:58.387
- Why?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

03:58.423 --> 04:00.723
It seems like every time I go to a party,

04:00.758 --> 04:04.560
somebody accidentally spits
their food into my mouth.

04:04.596 --> 04:06.512
- Come on.
- <i>I'm not kidding.</i>

04:06.564 --> 04:08.598
I'm like a... a Venus flytrap.

04:08.650 --> 04:12.401
A lot of times the other person
knows they spat in my mouth,

04:12.437 --> 04:14.520
but we pretend it didn't happen.

04:14.522 --> 04:16.355
Ugh, that's terrible.

04:16.357 --> 04:20.159
Yeah, last party I didn't
even bother eating my own food.

04:20.195 --> 04:22.912
Well, if you stick with
me, I won't eat anything

04:22.947 --> 04:24.914
and I won't spit in your mouth.

04:24.949 --> 04:26.532
Okay. Promise?

04:28.453 --> 04:30.203
All right.

04:30.255 --> 04:33.372
So, what are you two doing?

04:33.374 --> 04:35.842
A little World War II cosplay?

04:35.877 --> 04:37.009
Cosplay?

04:37.045 --> 04:39.762
You know, role playing with costumes, huh?

04:39.797 --> 04:41.597
Don't be disgusting.

04:41.633 --> 04:43.549
No, Ronnie, let me explain.

04:43.551 --> 04:47.220
We do this every few years on
the anniversary of the Falklands

04:47.222 --> 04:50.022
to celebrate the bloody
war coming to an end.

04:50.058 --> 04:53.025
Oh, I get it. A camping party.

04:53.061 --> 04:55.061
You should have invited me.

04:55.063 --> 04:57.647
I was a Boy Scout, if you can believe it.

04:57.699 --> 05:01.067
I got my first badge in
tossing salad.

05:01.119 --> 05:04.070
Well, we're having a proper party tonight.

05:04.072 --> 05:07.657
- Perhaps you'd like to come.
- Sure, and I'll bring Sylvia.

05:07.709 --> 05:09.709
She still asks about you, you know.

05:09.744 --> 05:12.128
- She does?
- Mmm.

05:14.999 --> 05:17.216
What are you doing?

05:17.252 --> 05:19.919
Push ups. I want to
look buff for the party.

05:19.971 --> 05:22.471
I can't believe how fast
you've become bisexual.

05:22.507 --> 05:23.839
I know.

05:23.892 --> 05:25.758
So you think you're gonna meet somebody?

05:25.760 --> 05:29.395
Maybe. I'm feeling very lush.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.814
Open. What about you?

05:31.849 --> 05:33.983
- Oh, I'm bringing a date.
- You're dating?

05:34.018 --> 05:36.769
I thought you were going on
vacation to find yourself.

05:36.821 --> 05:38.571
You can date before a vacation.

05:38.606 --> 05:40.489
Is Rosalie okay with this?

05:40.525 --> 05:41.607
Well, she's gonna bring Teddy.

05:41.609 --> 05:43.609
But it might be weird

05:43.611 --> 05:46.529
'cause the girl I met
is also named Rosalie.

05:46.581 --> 05:48.447
It's why I noticed her on Facebook.

05:48.499 --> 05:51.117
- Ew. Morning, Walter.
- Morning.

05:51.119 --> 05:53.452
Walter, Dr. Weiss is in your office.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.421
Damn. I'd forgotten.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.623
Uh, wait here, Harry.

05:57.625 --> 06:00.092
- Work on your knitting.
- Yes, Major.

06:01.679 --> 06:04.013
<i>Well done, Shelly.</i>

06:04.048 --> 06:06.382
Bet you'd make an excellent arm wrestler.

06:06.434 --> 06:07.850
- Really?
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

06:07.885 --> 06:09.635
Arm wrestling is a passion of mine,

06:09.687 --> 06:13.472
and I know who's good and who isn't.

06:15.610 --> 06:18.945
Yeah, Shelly. Yeah, you have value.

06:18.980 --> 06:21.364
Yeah, you're a good girl.

06:21.399 --> 06:23.282
Come on, Shelly.

06:26.487 --> 06:27.820
Hey.

06:27.822 --> 06:29.538
Morning, sir.

06:29.574 --> 06:32.124
Jim. You can call me Jim.

06:32.160 --> 06:33.659
Yes, sir.

06:33.711 --> 06:36.579
Hey, uh, Harry, what
are you always knitting?

06:36.631 --> 06:38.414
What is this?

06:38.466 --> 06:40.249
It's a hat for the major.

06:40.301 --> 06:43.302
Being bald, he's vulnerable to drafts.

06:43.338 --> 06:45.504
That's nice of you.

06:45.556 --> 06:49.008
Harry, I... I think it's beautiful,

06:49.060 --> 06:51.894
but why are you so devoted to Walter?

06:51.929 --> 06:54.847
I mean, I know he deserves it, but...

06:54.899 --> 06:56.565
But it seems excessive?

06:56.601 --> 07:00.186
- Well...
- It's not.

07:00.238 --> 07:02.521
33 years ago,

07:02.573 --> 07:05.191
the Major saved my life.

07:05.193 --> 07:08.694
I'd taken shrapnel and
would have bled to death

07:08.746 --> 07:10.946
slowly,

07:10.999 --> 07:13.783
which is not a pretty way to go.

07:15.119 --> 07:17.119
- I didn't... I didn't know.
- Yeah.

07:17.171 --> 07:19.403
He risked his life to save mine.

07:20.131 --> 07:25.376
So the least I can do,
Jim, knit him a hat..

07:26.014 --> 07:29.966
The truth is, Doctor,
for all the sex I've had,

07:30.018 --> 07:34.187
there have been very few
moments of profound happiness.

07:34.222 --> 07:35.689
What holds you back?

07:35.724 --> 07:38.975
I don't want to reveal myself.

07:38.977 --> 07:42.979
I live in public, but...

07:43.031 --> 07:46.950
oh, I have secrets. The war.

07:46.985 --> 07:48.785
<i>Look, can we talk
about something else?</i>

07:48.820 --> 07:52.072
I've never heard you
expound on my anal anxiety.

07:54.793 --> 07:58.328
Walter. Gardner wants
to see you in his office.

07:58.380 --> 08:00.163
We're in session.

08:04.336 --> 08:08.421
Is that little minx gonna be at your party?

08:08.473 --> 08:11.808
Gardner wants you to replace
your Falklands editorial

08:11.843 --> 08:15.145
because while you were
in session with Dr. Nutso,

08:15.180 --> 08:18.314
an Indiana congressman called Jeff Roberts

08:18.350 --> 08:21.101
was exposed by a male prostitute.

08:21.153 --> 08:25.572
Roberts was supportive of all
the anti-gay legislation there.

08:25.607 --> 08:27.073
Oh, God.

08:27.109 --> 08:29.659
That is the oldest story there is.

08:29.694 --> 08:32.028
The self-hating, closeted politician.

08:32.080 --> 08:35.749
Well, it's a huge story
and we have to cover it.

08:35.784 --> 08:38.251
Oh, Bob, we were just coming to you.

08:38.285 --> 08:41.587
Yeah, I'm not walking enough according
to my app, so I decided to sprint over.

08:41.623 --> 08:43.123
- Rosalie tell you?
- Yes.

08:43.174 --> 08:45.041
I do not want <i>Blunt Talk</i> involved

08:45.093 --> 08:48.178
in another one of these
tired tabloid witch-hunts.

08:48.213 --> 08:51.514
Uh-uh, this is a plane crash.
This is a sex plane crash

08:51.550 --> 08:53.433
and your numbers have started
to dip since your sex scandal.

08:53.468 --> 08:57.353
- But my Falklands editorial...
- No, this is important to me.

08:57.389 --> 09:00.223
It's very important.

09:00.225 --> 09:02.976
I'll see you at the party.
Looking forward to it.

09:03.028 --> 09:05.361
And Daddy is bringing a date.

09:06.698 --> 09:08.114
- Whoo.
- Damn it.

09:08.150 --> 09:10.733
I hate covering these kinds of things.

09:10.735 --> 09:14.904
I have felt the noose of public
shaming too often of late.

09:14.906 --> 09:16.406
So tell them that.

09:16.458 --> 09:19.459
Say you're sick of all
this puritanical bullshit.

09:19.494 --> 09:20.827
I know I am.

09:20.879 --> 09:22.662
So what Congressman Roberts

09:22.714 --> 09:25.081
stood for is reprehensible,

09:25.133 --> 09:28.918
but what he did in the
privacy of a hotel room is not.

09:28.920 --> 09:32.922
I, for one, would love to see a
day when there would be no judgment

09:32.924 --> 09:36.092
and no labels for what consenting adults do

09:36.094 --> 09:39.846
when being sensual in their private lives.

09:39.898 --> 09:42.148
No straight or gay or bi or trans.

09:42.184 --> 09:45.985
Just human beings in their endless variety.

09:46.021 --> 09:48.822
None more wrong or right than the next.

09:48.857 --> 09:51.741
Well, one can dream.

09:51.776 --> 09:53.943
So that's all we have for tonight,

09:53.945 --> 09:57.113
which happens to be the 33rd anniversary

09:57.115 --> 09:59.833
of the end of the Falklands War.

09:59.868 --> 10:02.285
May those fallen...

10:02.337 --> 10:04.420
...on both sides

10:04.456 --> 10:06.122
rest in peace.

10:07.459 --> 10:09.175
That was a lovely editorial, sir.

10:09.211 --> 10:12.795
Oh, Harry, it was pie in the sky dreaming.

10:12.848 --> 10:14.931
I sounded like John Lennon.

10:14.966 --> 10:17.967
Except that John was talking about peace.

10:18.019 --> 10:20.136
You're very gloomy today, sir.

10:20.188 --> 10:21.971
But let's try to rally.

10:21.973 --> 10:23.857
We have a party to throw.

10:23.892 --> 10:26.609
And, well, I have a gift for you.

10:30.482 --> 10:32.482
Ah.

10:32.484 --> 10:33.900
What is it, Harry?

10:33.952 --> 10:35.735
Oh, a tea cozy.

10:35.787 --> 10:37.737
No, it's a hat, sir.

10:37.789 --> 10:39.405
For drafts.

10:39.457 --> 10:42.625
Right. Thank you so much. I'll try it on.

10:46.548 --> 10:51.384
I seem to have misjudged the
dimensions of your skull, sir.

10:54.256 --> 10:56.839
Well, thank you all for coming.

10:56.892 --> 11:01.010
I am so heartened and delighted
to see each one of you here.

11:01.012 --> 11:04.764
Now, when we think on the Falklands War,

11:04.816 --> 11:08.184
we can be heartened to
know that today marks

11:08.236 --> 11:12.355
the day when hostilities ceased.

11:12.357 --> 11:14.824
So, let's...

11:17.579 --> 11:20.496
let's...

11:21.917 --> 11:24.617
So let's raise a glass

11:24.669 --> 11:26.869
to mark that day of peace.

11:26.922 --> 11:28.171
Hey, I thought this was a party.

11:28.206 --> 11:31.207
I brought a petting goat!

11:31.259 --> 11:33.209
Whoo!

11:33.261 --> 11:35.795
Whoa!

- Sorry. Hey.
- Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

11:52.397 --> 11:55.732
Walter, you were amazing tonight.

11:55.734 --> 11:57.317
Oh, thank you.

11:57.369 --> 11:58.868
Now dance with us or you're fired. Oh. Oh.

11:58.903 --> 12:01.988
This party's great. I am
so glad Bobby invited me.

12:02.040 --> 12:04.958
Bobby? Oh, yes, of course.

12:04.993 --> 12:07.577
Walter, I love this song.
Can I dance with you guys?

12:07.629 --> 12:10.079
Yes, please do. Let's get
a four-way bald selfie.

12:10.081 --> 12:11.748
Squeeze in.

12:13.218 --> 12:16.169
You're so beautiful.

12:16.221 --> 12:18.888
- Thank you.
- Everything is so beautiful.

12:18.923 --> 12:20.723
- You're so beautiful.
- Bob, come here.

12:23.311 --> 12:25.561
How long have you been dating, um...

12:25.597 --> 12:28.564
Uh, Emanuel. Yeah, I met him at
UBS just after you had him on.

12:28.600 --> 12:33.569
He was in the men's room, and holy
shit, did one thing lead to another.

12:33.605 --> 12:36.105
It was like ding-ding.

12:36.107 --> 12:37.774
You high?

12:37.776 --> 12:39.075
Yeah.

12:39.110 --> 12:40.693
- Bobby, come on.
- Yeah.

12:40.745 --> 12:42.612
<i>â™ª Tell me all the
things I've missed â™ª</i>

12:49.421 --> 12:50.953
<i>Walter.</i> Martin.

12:50.955 --> 12:54.257
- This is Rosalie.
- Rosalie?

12:54.292 --> 12:57.093
I know, it's just a coincidence, sort of.

12:57.128 --> 12:58.678
Mm, it's very nice to meet you, Mr. Blunt.

12:58.713 --> 13:01.881
It's a wonderful party. I
like all of the weird people.

13:01.933 --> 13:04.684
Oh, thank you, my dear. Come.

13:04.719 --> 13:08.521
<i>â™ª The palms are down,
I'm welcomed into town â™ª</i>

13:08.556 --> 13:12.191

13:12.227 --> 13:14.394
Thank you.

13:14.446 --> 13:17.947
<i>Look at how Martin's
carrying on with that girl.</i>

13:17.982 --> 13:19.649
Where's Teddy?

13:19.651 --> 13:23.703
Oh, he wasn't having one of his
good days so he stayed at home.

13:23.738 --> 13:26.823
His beautiful Armenian friend came around.

13:26.875 --> 13:29.792
I need another drink.

13:32.213 --> 13:34.080
How are you holding up?

13:34.132 --> 13:36.299
Not so good.

13:36.334 --> 13:38.584
How can we make this fun for you?

13:38.636 --> 13:42.055
I know. Let's tell each
other something weird

13:42.090 --> 13:44.807
and personal with every drink
that we have. You go first.

13:44.843 --> 13:46.926
I'm not good at drinking
games. You go first.

13:46.978 --> 13:49.645
Okay, I don't like
watching other people eat.

13:49.681 --> 13:52.014
I feel like they look like sort of animals

13:52.067 --> 13:53.399
and then I feel bad for judging them.

13:53.435 --> 13:55.184
Me, too. I watch them eat

13:55.186 --> 13:58.020
and then I'm picturing them on the toilet

13:58.073 --> 14:01.190
pooping later and it makes me sick.

14:01.192 --> 14:03.609
It's like hot dog in, hot dog out.

14:03.661 --> 14:06.028
Ew, yeah. I don't take it that far.

14:06.030 --> 14:08.531
Drink up.

14:08.583 --> 14:09.782
Mm.

14:09.834 --> 14:11.868
Get us more drinks.

14:11.870 --> 14:16.005
Okay, but what I said wasn't
that different from what you said.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.291
Two more drinks. Get whiskey.

14:18.343 --> 14:21.094
He was like, "That's definitely a ghost."

14:21.129 --> 14:23.629
Oh, Jim, this is Hershel.

14:23.681 --> 14:25.598
- He's a friend of Walter's.
- Oh, hey, man.

14:25.633 --> 14:28.384
Hey, nice to meet you.
How do you know Walter?

14:28.436 --> 14:30.553
He's my sex and love addicts sponsor.

14:30.605 --> 14:33.055
He don't return calls,
but he's a really nice...

14:33.057 --> 14:35.391
oh, shit, I just spit in your mouth.

14:35.393 --> 14:37.727
I am so sorry. I hate when that happens.

14:37.779 --> 14:41.697
It's okay. I'm just gonna
get a drink and wash it down.

14:41.733 --> 14:43.900
- Are you okay? I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

14:43.952 --> 14:46.319
It was just a little piece of hot dog, Jim.

14:47.739 --> 14:50.072
I put hot dogs in my mouth all the time.

14:52.210 --> 14:53.576
Stan, what the hell are you doing?

14:53.628 --> 14:55.461
You're my guest here tonight.

14:55.497 --> 14:57.630
I feel more comfortable
behind the bar, Mr. Blunt.

14:57.665 --> 15:01.217
- Usual?
- Yes, thanks, Stan. You're too kind.

15:01.252 --> 15:03.052
- Oh, hi.
- How you doing?

15:03.087 --> 15:06.672
- Can I get a vodka soda and a water, please?
- Sure.

15:06.724 --> 15:08.558
You sure you're okay with Moby DJing?

15:08.593 --> 15:11.260
Yes, I accept your relationship.

15:11.312 --> 15:14.814
Mr. and Mrs. Blunt.
Thank you for having me.

15:14.849 --> 15:17.517
I've never socialized with
parents of my students before.

15:17.569 --> 15:19.435
Oh, well, I hope it's
not too inappropriate.

15:19.487 --> 15:22.071
Oh, it might be, but I like it.

15:22.106 --> 15:23.489
It's an honor to meet you.

15:23.525 --> 15:25.274
As a producer of high-end erotica,

15:25.326 --> 15:27.276
I am also against genital mutilation.

15:27.278 --> 15:30.112
If you don't mind, I'd rather
not talk shop at a party.

15:30.165 --> 15:33.032
- Yeah.
- Hey, have you guys seen Celia?

15:33.084 --> 15:34.784
No.

15:34.836 --> 15:37.787
- You know what I mean?
- Yes. Finally, some...

15:37.789 --> 15:39.455
you know, look, when it comes to sex

15:39.507 --> 15:41.174
it's like I'm spinning a roulette wheel.

15:41.209 --> 15:43.342
I mean, I've tried every
perversion at least once.

15:43.378 --> 15:46.295
For years I was a sub then a cross-dresser.

15:46.347 --> 15:47.513
And now I'm an exhibitionist.

15:47.549 --> 15:50.299
Oh, my God, I love how open you are.

15:50.301 --> 15:52.218
You know, I came here
hoping to meet a girl,

15:52.270 --> 15:54.303
but I am happy to meet an open guy.

15:54.305 --> 15:57.023
Well, I mean, for me,
straight sex is the kinkiest.

15:57.058 --> 15:59.475
I mean, intimacy between a man and a woman?

15:59.477 --> 16:02.144
- Mm-hmm.
- Affection, kissing?

16:02.197 --> 16:05.448
Whoo, ain't that some sick action.

16:05.483 --> 16:06.949
- Yeah.
- You know what?

16:06.985 --> 16:09.902
- To straight sex.
- To straight sex.

16:11.203 --> 16:13.487
Thanks, Jim. I need a fresh one.

16:13.489 --> 16:16.206
Uh, no, that was for Celia.

16:16.242 --> 16:19.660
So why are you going on the
Appalachian Trail for your vacation?

16:19.712 --> 16:22.129
I just need to walk and think

16:22.164 --> 16:24.798
and, mm, figure out my life.

16:24.834 --> 16:26.467
I mean, I'm almost 28.

16:26.502 --> 16:29.219
- Hello, Martin.
- Rosalie.

16:29.255 --> 16:32.005
Uh, Rosalie, this is Rosalie.

16:32.058 --> 16:34.007
- What?
- I know, it's weird.

16:34.060 --> 16:36.393
You're only the third
other Rosalie I've ever met.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.979
Well, it's very nice to meet you.

16:39.014 --> 16:41.432
Any friend of Martin's is a friend of mine.

16:41.484 --> 16:44.234
Uh, you two have fun now, okay?

16:44.270 --> 16:47.404
Actually, we're going to go,

16:47.440 --> 16:49.990
but is all this okay?

16:50.025 --> 16:52.743
Of course, darling. Mwah.

16:52.778 --> 16:55.112
- It's fine.
- Okay.

17:11.881 --> 17:13.347
<i>Hey, is everything all right?</i>

17:13.382 --> 17:16.133
You want to talk or do
you want to do a line?

17:16.185 --> 17:18.301
Both?

17:18.354 --> 17:19.887
Hey, hey, hey.

17:19.888 --> 17:20.938
Hey, man.

17:23.025 --> 17:26.527
As a musician, you must have
had a lot of success with women.

17:26.561 --> 17:29.062
At one time, yes.

17:29.064 --> 17:32.533
- I peaked in 1988.
- Oh, I see.

17:32.568 --> 17:35.903
Well, the Major described a good orgasm

17:35.955 --> 17:39.490
like a red comet followed by a black abyss.

17:39.542 --> 17:41.208
Was that your experience?

17:41.243 --> 17:42.743
That's not how I'd put it.

17:42.795 --> 17:45.746
For me it was like a pitcher of water

17:45.798 --> 17:48.582
you pour off a high balcony.

17:48.584 --> 17:51.301
In Paris.

17:51.337 --> 17:53.887
In the 16th arrondissement.

17:53.923 --> 17:55.088
Wow.

17:55.090 --> 17:58.809
Hi, Harry. This is my mom Nora.

17:58.844 --> 18:00.978
It's so nice to finally meet you.

18:01.013 --> 18:02.763
Nice to meet you.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.599
But excuse me, ladies.
There's something I have to do.

18:05.651 --> 18:07.234
I'll leave you in Phil's capable hands.

18:10.439 --> 18:12.823
<i>â™ª Turn the music up... â™ª</i>

18:12.858 --> 18:14.107
Excuse me.

18:14.109 --> 18:15.826
Oh, just...

18:18.497 --> 18:20.497
What are you doing here?

18:20.533 --> 18:23.283
- I received an invitation.
- A mistake was made.

18:23.285 --> 18:26.620
You were very rude to the
Major and are not welcome here.

18:26.622 --> 18:29.456
Unhand me. I'm a member of the press

18:29.458 --> 18:31.041
and this is my tennis elbow.

18:31.093 --> 18:33.877
- I don't give a flying...
- What's going on, Harry?

18:33.929 --> 18:36.463
I found this spy on the premises, sir.

18:36.465 --> 18:38.465
And I'm giving him the boot.

18:38.517 --> 18:41.351
I received an invitation, Mr. Blunt.

18:41.387 --> 18:43.604
<i>And so I thought
you had forgiven me.</i>

18:43.639 --> 18:46.690
Also, you look like my father,
who is institutionalized

18:46.725 --> 18:48.942
when I was a child, so
if we could be friends...

18:48.978 --> 18:51.895
Oh, let him stay, Harry.
It's a party, after all.

18:51.947 --> 18:54.648
So I can stay?

18:54.650 --> 18:56.450
Thank you, friend.

18:56.485 --> 18:59.319
Ooh, a clown. I love clowns.

18:59.371 --> 19:00.537
Good-bye.

19:02.708 --> 19:04.708
He's a strange one.

19:04.743 --> 19:06.743
How are you feeling, Major?

19:06.795 --> 19:08.629
- Still a bit gloomy?
- Oh...

19:08.664 --> 19:11.298
Harry, come and get a drink with me.

19:11.333 --> 19:13.884
- Well...
- Go on, Harry. Have fun.

19:13.919 --> 19:16.753
I'm fine. Look, I'm surrounded by friends.

19:31.270 --> 19:32.903
Oh, my God.

19:34.690 --> 19:37.608
- I feel like King Arthur.
- Oh!

19:37.660 --> 19:39.576
Yeah!

19:39.612 --> 19:42.579
Did you see that? Extraordinary.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.164
Hey, Walter, have you seen Celia?

19:44.199 --> 19:46.783
Oh, I think she's over
there by the contortionist.

19:48.370 --> 19:50.420
Come on. Oh, no.

19:50.456 --> 19:51.838
How do you think he does that?

19:51.874 --> 19:54.541
They lubricate their throats with Vaseline.

19:54.543 --> 19:56.063
How do they get the Vaseline in there?

19:56.095 --> 19:58.679
Oh, Lord, Jim, I don't know everything.

19:58.714 --> 20:00.764
Okay, thanks.

20:00.799 --> 20:03.467
Hey, there you are.

20:03.519 --> 20:07.437
Hey, sorry, I lost you and your drink.

20:07.473 --> 20:09.189
Yeah, well, I came right to the source.

20:09.224 --> 20:12.059
Here's my weird thing. I
get too drunk at parties.

20:12.061 --> 20:13.977
And I was born with a small tail,

20:14.029 --> 20:17.314
but my parents had it snipped off.

20:17.366 --> 20:18.732
You tell me something.

20:18.784 --> 20:20.784
That's gonna be hard to top.

20:20.819 --> 20:22.903
- Well, try.
- Um...

20:24.323 --> 20:27.124
Uh, okay. Um...

20:27.159 --> 20:31.628
sometimes when I'm writing a
piece for the show at my desk,

20:31.664 --> 20:33.880
I get nervous and then I'll look down

20:33.916 --> 20:36.333
and I realize that I'm...

20:36.385 --> 20:39.720
I'm squeezing my penis through
my pants like a little boy.

20:39.755 --> 20:41.338
Really?

20:41.390 --> 20:43.140
That's adorable.

20:43.175 --> 20:44.925
- You think so?
- Yeah.

20:44.977 --> 20:47.728
Oh, God, I'm so drunk.

20:47.763 --> 20:49.896
I shouldn't have worn these heels.

20:49.932 --> 20:52.232
Oh, I just want to lie down.

20:53.902 --> 20:55.936
<i>â™ª</i>

21:01.443 --> 21:02.993
Great party.

21:03.028 --> 21:05.078
Excellent clown.

21:08.500 --> 21:11.284
<i>â™ª Say hello to your world â™ª</i>

Oh hey, hey, hey...

21:34.561 --> 21:36.645
- Sorry.
- Oops.

21:38.198 --> 21:41.400
<i>You were saying?</i>

21:45.489 --> 21:48.040
My first husband Joey,

21:48.075 --> 21:50.993
the one who died of
leukemia when we were 26...

21:50.995 --> 21:54.746
...he was just like Martin.

21:54.798 --> 21:58.083
A romantic with a cleft chin, same nose.

21:58.135 --> 22:03.005
And for 40 years I've been mourning Joey

22:03.007 --> 22:07.759
and this other life we could have had.

22:07.811 --> 22:10.012
So when Joey died,

22:10.064 --> 22:12.931
that Rosalie died with him.

22:14.518 --> 22:17.653
But Martin somehow...

22:17.688 --> 22:21.023
he sort of brought her back to life.

22:21.025 --> 22:24.109
God damn it! We're in session!

22:24.161 --> 22:26.528
Oh, oh, sorry, Walter.

22:26.580 --> 22:29.197
No, no, no, no. I... I apologize.

<i>â™ª</i>

22:38.592 --> 22:40.709
Good Lord.

22:40.711 --> 22:44.930
Oh, no. Now Walter's gonna think
something's going on between us.

22:44.965 --> 22:46.565
Well, I... I... I could go run after him

22:46.600 --> 22:48.216
and just explain that you were drunk

22:48.268 --> 22:49.851
and I was helping you lay down.

22:49.887 --> 22:51.770
No, don't bother.

22:51.805 --> 22:53.305
But, you know what?

22:53.357 --> 22:55.724
I left my bag somewhere
and it's got my phone in it.

22:55.776 --> 22:57.442
<i>Could you find it?</i>

22:57.478 --> 23:01.229
It's burgundy with a gold
Moroccan design on it.

23:01.281 --> 23:02.898
Yeah, sure.

23:02.950 --> 23:04.816
Oh, thanks. You're a star.

23:10.407 --> 23:12.574
I'll go find your purse.

23:36.984 --> 23:39.184
Hey. Hey. Hey, everybody.

23:39.236 --> 23:41.319
Everybody. Um, excuse me.

23:41.355 --> 23:43.772
Has anyone seen a burgundy purse...

23:43.824 --> 23:45.657
Are you out of your mind?

23:51.331 --> 23:54.616
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

23:56.170 --> 23:58.787
Hey, Walter, have you seen Celia's purse?

23:58.789 --> 24:01.089
Jim, I don't know everything.

24:04.962 --> 24:06.294
What happened?

24:06.296 --> 24:09.297
Oh, just a cardiac event.

24:09.299 --> 24:12.300
That's how you know it's a good party.

24:12.352 --> 24:14.386
Oh, God, this is all my fault.

24:14.438 --> 24:16.805
Oh, don't beat yourself up, Walter.

24:16.857 --> 24:19.775
Not everything is your fault.

24:21.361 --> 24:23.645
I'll go with him to the hospital.

24:23.697 --> 24:25.147
Yeah.

24:35.709 --> 24:37.542
You got the strength,
you got the talent, Rita.- Ow! Ow!

24:37.578 --> 24:40.662
Tear her fucking arm off,
Rita! Tear her fucking arm off!

24:43.750 --> 24:47.419
She's half
your size, Rita. Come on! Come on!

24:52.342 --> 24:54.843
- What the fuck, Rita?
- Yes, I did it!

24:54.845 --> 24:57.512
Oh, shit. What a disappointment.

24:57.514 --> 25:00.348
- That is a tragedy, Rita.
- What happened?

25:00.350 --> 25:03.318
- That is a fucking tragedy right there.
<i>- Bam!</i>

25:03.353 --> 25:05.403
In your face, Emeril.

25:35.219 --> 25:38.270
Sorry that took so... ahem...

25:38.305 --> 25:40.105
took so long.

26:02.379 --> 26:04.829
I can't believe this is happening again.

26:04.882 --> 26:08.550
Well, in my business,
most of the guys are creeps

26:08.585 --> 26:11.720
and you were the nicest
guy I've met in a long time.

26:13.056 --> 26:15.090
Oh, Sylvia.

26:15.092 --> 26:18.143
Also, I'm a size queen.

Stay put. I'll be right there.

26:53.764 --> 26:55.797
Hurry.

26:58.135 --> 27:00.552

27:00.604 --> 27:03.021
Hold on, Harry.

27:14.401 --> 27:17.068
It's all right, Harry. I'm here.

27:20.073 --> 27:21.656
You're gonna be fine.

27:23.410 --> 27:25.827
You didn't leave me.

27:25.879 --> 27:28.380
No, of course not.
