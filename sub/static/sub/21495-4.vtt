00:08.309 --> 00:10.244
COACH:
I believe in Romania.

00:10.311 --> 00:13.047
Romania is the land
where I was born.

00:13.114 --> 00:15.383
Where I met my wife.

00:15.449 --> 00:17.585
Where I raised my family.

00:17.651 --> 00:21.422
It is in Romania
that I found opportunity.

00:21.489 --> 00:23.524
That is why, when we travel

00:23.591 --> 00:26.260
outside the borders
of our great nation,

00:26.327 --> 00:30.398
we must wear the red,
yellow and blue with pride.

00:30.464 --> 00:34.468
And we also must remember
we are not in Bucharest anymore.

00:34.535 --> 00:38.072
We are in
a very, very dangerous land.

00:38.139 --> 00:40.108
A land
in which the deepest recesses

00:40.174 --> 00:45.479
of a man's capacity for evil
are encouraged and exploited.

00:45.546 --> 00:50.284
A land called New York City.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.653
(siren wailing in distance)

00:58.626 --> 01:01.061
So.

01:01.129 --> 01:04.831
Joseph, Nikita,
while we are here,

01:04.897 --> 01:06.600
much like the foundation
on which

01:06.667 --> 01:09.603
we live our lives, we must
look out for one another.

01:09.670 --> 01:15.776
If you need anything, just bang
on the wall, and I will come.

01:15.843 --> 01:18.212
But do not leave this room.

01:18.279 --> 01:20.514
Should you leave,

01:20.581 --> 01:26.086
there's a good chance
you will never come back.

01:28.256 --> 01:30.591
Now get some rest,

01:30.658 --> 01:35.696
because come tomorrow morning,
we wrestle.

01:37.965 --> 01:40.501
(door opens)

01:40.568 --> 01:43.404
-(door closes)
-Uh, Nikita, what are you doing?

01:43.471 --> 01:45.773
Mm, do you mean,
"What are we doing?"

01:45.839 --> 01:48.409
-We are going out.
-Are you crazy? You heard Coach.

01:48.476 --> 01:50.544
If we go out,
we may never come back.

01:50.611 --> 01:51.845
Come on, Joseph.

01:51.912 --> 01:54.081
Do you remember the
awesome time we had in Moscow?

01:54.148 --> 01:56.650
Or the fun we had in Hanoi,
Beijing?

01:56.717 --> 01:58.819

01:58.886 --> 01:59.920
But we're in the West now.

01:59.987 --> 02:01.622
Yeah. So what?

02:01.689 --> 02:04.392

Come on.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.727

-Oh, no.

the prism of the American.

10:17.818 --> 10:22.089
The United States

these atrocities?

One word...

11:17.010 --> 11:19.012
God.

That's her.

14:39.479 --> 14:42.849
Oh, I don't mind working
on my weekend day off.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.017
(laughs)

14:44.084 --> 14:45.685
(woman in film laughs, sighs)

14:45.752 --> 14:50.257
We need to complete the merger
paperwork for our two companies.

14:50.323 --> 14:53.426
Your company's profits are big.

14:53.493 --> 14:56.796
Yes, our employees spend their
holiday in Miami Beach, Florida.

14:56.863 --> 14:57.931
(both laugh)

14:57.998 --> 14:59.399
I have no idea what's going on.

14:59.466 --> 15:03.136
Seems to be some type
of American propaganda film.

15:03.203 --> 15:04.404
TODD (in film):
We have a deal then?

15:04.471 --> 15:07.540
WOMAN (in film):
Let's shake on it.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.142
(groans)

15:09.209 --> 15:11.311
I completely lost the plot.

15:11.378 --> 15:14.414
Do you realize that we've
just made a million dollars?

15:14.481 --> 15:18.185
Whatever are we going to do with
the rest of our weekend now?

15:18.251 --> 15:19.987
Mm.

15:20.053 --> 15:23.190
I can think of another merger.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.161
(woman moaning in film)

15:28.228 --> 15:29.796
This is disgusting.

15:29.862 --> 15:32.165
(Todd laughs in film)

15:32.232 --> 15:35.435
(woman moans in film)

15:35.502 --> 15:37.437
(moaning in film)

15:40.240 --> 15:41.641
TODD (in film):
Had a lot of fun today.

15:41.708 --> 15:44.811
I must fly first class
to Hong Kong.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.179
GREGOR:
Turn that shit off.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.680
Huh? Oh, oh, whoa.
Hey, you can't...

15:47.747 --> 15:49.482
GREGOR:
Bucharest PD!

15:49.549 --> 15:50.984
MAN:
Let's get out of here, man.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.353
GREGOR: Which one of you wants
to spend the night in jail?

15:53.420 --> 15:55.588
Ugh, fuck!

15:59.259 --> 16:00.727
What can you tell us about her?

16:00.793 --> 16:03.330
-Never seen her before.
-GREGOR: Never seen her before?

16:03.396 --> 16:05.832
30 seconds ago you were
jerking off to her, asshole.

16:05.898 --> 16:07.034
(laughs sarcastically)

16:07.100 --> 16:08.268
JOSEPH:
She worked here

16:08.335 --> 16:09.702
and now she's missing.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.538
(grunting)

16:14.974 --> 16:17.210
(coughs)
Ow!

16:17.277 --> 16:19.712
Talk or you'll be pissing blood
for the next year.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.248
Fuck you!

16:21.314 --> 16:22.349
(grunts)

16:22.415 --> 16:24.151
All right, Gregor,
that's enough.

16:24.217 --> 16:25.718
(projectionist groans, gasps)

16:25.785 --> 16:28.521
Please, we need your help.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.657
Fuck off. You don't think
I know what you're doing?

16:30.723 --> 16:31.958
Huh?

16:32.025 --> 16:33.293
What are we doing?

16:33.360 --> 16:35.662
Good cop, bad cop routine.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.064
Fuck you, good cop.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.999
I'm not talking,
so let bad cop do his worst.

16:40.067 --> 16:42.602
Oh, I'm sorry.
We gave you the impression

16:42.669 --> 16:45.805
that my partner here
was the bad cop?

16:45.872 --> 16:47.640
(grunts)

16:47.707 --> 16:50.643
That was incorrect.

16:50.710 --> 16:54.013
(screams, cries)

16:55.882 --> 17:00.087
See, the good cop wouldn't have
sliced your femoral artery

17:00.153 --> 17:01.588
so that you'd bleed to death

17:01.654 --> 17:03.356
without expeditious
medical attention.

17:03.423 --> 17:06.326
But I'm not the good cop.

17:06.393 --> 17:12.165
I'm the very, very bad cop.

17:12.232 --> 17:15.402
And you're about to die.

17:15.468 --> 17:18.238
Lucky for you, good cop here
will treat your wound

17:18.305 --> 17:19.771
with a lifesaving tourniquet.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.407
PROJECTIONIST:
Fuck!

17:21.473 --> 17:24.243
(screams)

17:24.310 --> 17:27.280
(projectionist groaning)

17:27.347 --> 17:29.716
Be careful, you stupid idiot!

17:29.782 --> 17:32.219
You better start talking before
my partner makes me loosen that.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.721
-JOSEPH: Tell us about the girl.
-I don't know, man.

17:34.787 --> 17:37.490
She worked here and one day
she stopped coming in.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.859
Next thing I know, she started
showing up in these movies.

17:39.926 --> 17:41.994
And who's making these movies?

17:42.061 --> 17:45.732
Bubescu. Petre Bubescu.

17:45.798 --> 17:47.234
Is he a filmmaker?

17:47.300 --> 17:49.236
He thinks he's a filmmaker.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.771
Calls himself an artist,
but he's really just a pimp.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.340
How do we find him?

17:53.406 --> 17:54.874
PROJECTIONIST: He's got
a big house in the hills.

17:54.941 --> 17:58.445
Bigger than a piece of shit
like you'll ever have.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.813
(laughs) Throws lots
of big parties there,

18:00.880 --> 18:03.350
got lots of drugs and girls.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.585
I was seeing a chick who went
to one of these parties,

18:05.652 --> 18:07.920
said the dude was
into some sick shit.

18:07.987 --> 18:09.088
I don't know.

18:09.156 --> 18:11.191
And this pimp, Petre Bubescu,

18:11.258 --> 18:13.593
we're gonna need
an introduction.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.495
Fuck.

18:15.562 --> 18:18.365
JOSEPH:
Petre Bubescu.

18:18.431 --> 18:22.369
His secret police file has
mysteriously gone missing.

18:22.435 --> 18:23.970
(Dragos chuckles)

18:24.036 --> 18:26.306
Here's what we've been able
to piece together.

18:26.373 --> 18:28.641
He showed up
in the downtown theater scene,

18:28.708 --> 18:30.543
rubbing elbows
with the literati.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.779
Sounds like he had more
ambition than talent.

18:32.845 --> 18:36.048
Started pimping in order
to pay for his productions.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.651
Remains unrecognized
in the theater,

18:38.718 --> 18:40.787
but makes a name
for himself as a pimp.

18:40.853 --> 18:42.155
Then, three years ago...

18:42.222 --> 18:44.023
And this is where things
get interesting.

18:44.090 --> 18:45.325
...he disappears.

18:45.392 --> 18:47.627
Some swore that
he'd run off to the West

18:47.694 --> 18:50.697
where his artistic genius
would be recognized,

18:50.763 --> 18:53.833
while those closest to him
assumed his failure as an artist

18:53.900 --> 18:55.101
led to suicide.

18:55.168 --> 18:56.469
No such luck.

18:56.536 --> 18:59.038
Tipsy.

18:59.105 --> 19:00.807
He popped up again a year ago...

19:00.873 --> 19:02.542
(Joseph clears throat)

19:02.609 --> 19:06.879
...producing propaganda films
inspired by the West.

19:09.949 --> 19:12.752
Popular on the black market.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.254
(chuckles)

19:14.321 --> 19:16.423
GREGOR: Tipsy tracked
his name in connection

19:16.489 --> 19:18.891
to a small state-sponsored
trucking business.

19:18.958 --> 19:21.194
JOSEPH:
Tipsy.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.230
Detective Anghel and I
will go undercover.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.432
We'll pose as black marketeers,

19:25.498 --> 19:28.100
peddling Western soft drinks.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.903
Orzan will make
the introduction.

19:30.970 --> 19:34.106
Of course.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.642
Once inside, we get him

19:35.708 --> 19:38.711
to commit to a sale
and distribution.

19:38.778 --> 19:41.581
Meanwhile, we'll position
officers up the street,

19:41.648 --> 19:45.885
monitoring the situation
led by me.

19:45.952 --> 19:48.154
Fighting capitalist propaganda

19:48.221 --> 19:50.357
is one of the state's
top priorities.

19:50.423 --> 19:53.092
Yeah, that and losing files
up your ass.

19:53.159 --> 19:55.328
-What did you say?
-Attention.

19:55.395 --> 19:56.929
Files disappear
in your assholes.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.197
Captain, please.

19:58.265 --> 19:59.232
What'd I say?

19:59.299 --> 20:01.234
I said enough!

20:04.170 --> 20:05.638
Come on.

20:05.705 --> 20:09.742
If this man is as dangerous
as you say he is,

20:09.809 --> 20:13.079
who knows how he'll react
when he's provoked?

20:13.145 --> 20:15.515
We won't let it escalate.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.083
We'll have him take the bait.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.251
We leave.

20:18.318 --> 20:19.919
Dinca brings in the cavalry.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.321
We got this, Captain.

20:25.024 --> 20:25.958
Fine.

20:26.025 --> 20:27.927
All right, let's go.

20:27.994 --> 20:30.930
Let's get ready.
Move out.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.999
(groans)

20:33.065 --> 20:34.801
COVACI:
Gregor, Joseph, hold up.

20:36.903 --> 20:40.006
My boys...

20:40.072 --> 20:42.775
if this thing goes south,

20:42.842 --> 20:47.480
I will knock your dicks...
in the dirt.

21:02.061 --> 21:04.431
We should have guns.

21:04.497 --> 21:07.700
(sighs) Job like this,
we should definitely have guns.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.168
I'm telling you, man,
first thing

21:09.235 --> 21:10.537
these guys do is frisk you.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.271
I don't care if
you're fucking Trotsky,

21:12.339 --> 21:15.041
you go in, you get frisked.

21:45.338 --> 21:47.474
♪ ♪

21:57.016 --> 22:00.453
Yep, we should definitely
have guns.

22:00.520 --> 22:03.923
ORZAN:
Hey, Agota!

22:03.990 --> 22:05.858
How you doing?

22:05.925 --> 22:10.229
Ha... Nice night.
(chuckles)

22:10.296 --> 22:13.132
Ah. Looking good.

22:13.199 --> 22:16.436
Stairs. Heh.

22:16.503 --> 22:18.170
Oh, these are my,
my good friends,

22:18.237 --> 22:20.640
Vali and, uh, Teo.
(chuckles)

22:20.707 --> 22:22.642
We're here to see the man.

22:23.610 --> 22:25.812
Does the man want to see you?

22:25.878 --> 22:29.081
Oh, yeah, yeah,
he knows we're coming.

22:29.148 --> 22:30.817
Hmm! Here we go.

22:30.883 --> 22:33.420
Arms up.
(nervous laughter)

22:36.088 --> 22:38.625
Shouldn't you buy me
dinner first? (chuckles)

22:38.691 --> 22:40.460
(Orzan laughs loudly)

22:47.934 --> 22:49.536
Ow!

22:49.602 --> 22:51.438
(Orzan laughs nervously)

22:54.106 --> 22:56.042
(dance music playing)

23:01.280 --> 23:04.851
(laughing):
There they are!

23:04.917 --> 23:08.821
My new best friends.
Get down here.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.858
Come on, bros.
What do you think?

23:11.924 --> 23:14.594
Pretty nice, huh?
The very best.

23:14.661 --> 23:17.764
You can go swimming
in the winter! Ha!

23:17.830 --> 23:20.032
I had these palm trees
flown in from Iraq.

23:20.099 --> 23:22.334
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't ask me how much I paid.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.136
Okay, I paid a lot.
(laughing)

23:24.203 --> 23:26.673
Orzan, introduce us.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.374
Oh yeah, these, uh,
these are my good friends,

23:28.441 --> 23:30.042
Vali and Teo.

23:30.109 --> 23:31.478
Petre Bubescu.

23:31.544 --> 23:32.612
That's who I am,

23:32.679 --> 23:35.848
but please call me Bert.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.416
B-R-T. Bert.

23:37.484 --> 23:39.686
Heh?

23:42.221 --> 23:44.156
Ah, you like the view.

23:44.223 --> 23:46.893
So do I.
(laughs)

23:46.959 --> 23:48.795
Don't believe me?
Check out my shorts.

23:48.861 --> 23:51.664
Got a boner the size of
the Palace of the Parliament!

23:51.731 --> 23:53.966
(laughs) The Palace
of the Parliament!

23:54.033 --> 23:58.437
Ha-ha! So, Orzan tells me
you have something for me.

23:58.505 --> 24:02.509
-Yeah. Yeah.
-We do... Bert.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.044
Please, sit.

24:12.852 --> 24:13.786
Ow.

24:14.654 --> 24:16.989
Ow... ow.

24:23.095 --> 24:25.131
Can I have a taste?

24:34.106 --> 24:38.945
Ah! Straight shot of pure,
unfiltered caffeinated soda pop!

24:39.011 --> 24:41.113
Whoo!

24:41.180 --> 24:43.349
Whoo, this is good stuff.

24:43.415 --> 24:49.188
(growls, whoops, moans)

24:50.623 --> 24:52.391
We can smuggle it in
through Transylvania.

24:52.458 --> 24:55.795
We just need distribution
once we're across the border.

24:55.862 --> 24:58.230
Wait...

24:58.297 --> 25:01.668
I mean, gentlemen,
as they say in America,

25:01.734 --> 25:03.335
"Let's make a deal!"

25:03.402 --> 25:04.837
That's great news.

25:04.904 --> 25:07.239
And on a personal level, Bert,
we just want to say

25:07.306 --> 25:08.440
what big fans we are.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.476
JOSEPH:
Oh, yeah, big time.

25:10.543 --> 25:13.245
The Business of Business
was a true depiction

25:13.312 --> 25:15.147
of the West and all its glory.

25:15.214 --> 25:18.017
Ah, thanks.
We try to get it right.

25:18.084 --> 25:20.587
It's important that Romanians
get to see the West

25:20.653 --> 25:22.822
not as some God-fearing,

25:22.889 --> 25:27.059
crime-ridden, horny,
money-hungry cesspool,

25:27.126 --> 25:31.130
but for what the West
really is!

25:31.197 --> 25:33.299
And what is it, exactly?

25:33.365 --> 25:36.636
A paradise of opportunity!

25:36.703 --> 25:39.271
Wait, I got an idea.

25:39.338 --> 25:41.507
Katia! Come here, beautiful.

25:41.574 --> 25:45.578
Take this guy upstairs
to meet Tatyana.

25:45.645 --> 25:48.981
Tatyana Popescu?
She's here?

25:49.048 --> 25:53.419
Yeah, why wouldn't she be?
This is her home.

25:53.485 --> 25:56.355
Want her autograph?

25:56.422 --> 25:59.191
Katia,
take him to Tatyana.

25:59.258 --> 26:01.060
(laughing)

26:01.127 --> 26:03.562
(laughs) Yeah.

26:03.630 --> 26:04.631
(mumbles)

26:04.697 --> 26:06.666
Hey, hey, you stay here
with me, big guy.

26:06.733 --> 26:08.668
Don't leave me here
with Orzan.

26:08.735 --> 26:10.770
He creeps me out.
(shudders)

26:10.837 --> 26:11.938
Let me show you around.

26:12.004 --> 26:14.641
(sniffs) Ah.
You like girls?

26:14.707 --> 26:17.944
-I like girls.
-ORZAN: Hold on.

26:18.010 --> 26:20.279
BUBESCU:
You work out?

26:21.814 --> 26:23.883
Tatyana's aunt is look for her.

26:23.950 --> 26:25.785
She'd like to see her again.

26:25.852 --> 26:28.154
Is that who sent you?

26:28.220 --> 26:31.758
Let them know Tatyana's fine,
she likes it here.

26:31.824 --> 26:33.325
How about you?

26:33.392 --> 26:36.295
Is there anyone out there
looking for you?

26:38.064 --> 26:39.832
(whispering):
You don't have to be scared.

26:39.899 --> 26:42.601
I can protect you.

26:42.669 --> 26:45.237
You're swimming in deep waters,
my friend.

26:51.678 --> 26:55.715
There's a Cold War going on,
and I consider myself a soldier.

26:55.782 --> 26:58.350
-Isn't that right, Zoya?
-Whatever you say, baby.

26:58.417 --> 27:00.787
Please, sit.
Originally,

27:00.853 --> 27:04.023
I was going to change the world
through theatre.

27:04.090 --> 27:07.626
First production I put up
was Romeo and Juliet.

27:07.694 --> 27:10.296
But my version was different.

27:10.362 --> 27:13.232
See, in my version,

27:13.299 --> 27:16.468
the better version,
Juliet never dies.

27:16.535 --> 27:18.170
Romeo wakes up.

27:18.237 --> 27:23.175
They kiss, they embrace,
they live happily ever after.

27:23.242 --> 27:24.043
Sensational.

27:24.110 --> 27:26.746
-The critics hated it.
-It was savage.

27:26.813 --> 27:29.281
But I stand by what I did.

27:29.348 --> 27:30.983
It made me want to blow
my fucking brains out.

27:31.050 --> 27:33.720
That would be a small mess.
(chuckles)

27:33.786 --> 27:37.790
Look, the truth is,
you put on one play,

27:37.857 --> 27:40.993
and you're lucky
if 100 people show up.

27:41.060 --> 27:44.396
Hardly the spark that'll start
a capitalist revolution.

27:44.463 --> 27:46.966
So, what do you do?

27:47.033 --> 27:49.101
BUBESCU:
Excellent question, Teo.

27:54.673 --> 27:57.343
(cocks gun)
I think we should go in.

27:57.409 --> 27:59.511
No, no.

27:59.578 --> 28:02.782
Just sit tight, Tipsy.

28:05.351 --> 28:08.087
This is Tatyana's room.

28:10.122 --> 28:11.724
Mmm.

28:14.293 --> 28:17.964
We should kill some time
until she gets back.

28:21.067 --> 28:22.769
What are you doing?

28:22.835 --> 28:25.204
-(moans)
-Hp--

28:26.172 --> 28:28.975
Hey.
I'm a married man.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.443
I'm... I'm sorry.

28:31.510 --> 28:34.947
Put your clothes on.

28:35.014 --> 28:39.618
I'm... so, so sorry.

28:39.685 --> 28:42.221
-(grunts)
-Huh?

28:46.793 --> 28:48.260
What did you do to me?

28:53.599 --> 28:56.668
You...

28:56.735 --> 28:59.205
-You...
-(sighs)

29:00.773 --> 29:04.543
Mmm. (moans)

29:04.610 --> 29:09.548
(breathing heavily)
Oh.

29:09.615 --> 29:10.983
MAN:
Okay, that's it.

29:11.050 --> 29:12.551
Keep going. Don't-- Ignore me.

29:12.618 --> 29:15.354
Don't mind me, don't mind me.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.156
(moans)

29:21.193 --> 29:24.196
See, everybody,
both sides of the Cold War,

29:24.263 --> 29:27.433
has this fear
of nuclear weapons.

29:27.499 --> 29:30.702
But, they're forgetting
that the war,

29:30.769 --> 29:34.073
the real war,
is about ideas.

29:34.140 --> 29:36.242
It's a war for your mind.

29:36.308 --> 29:37.376
Look...

29:38.344 --> 29:41.347
Which is why this...
Mwah!

29:41.413 --> 29:43.883
...may be the single most
effective weapon

29:43.950 --> 29:45.184
of mass destruction.

29:46.685 --> 29:48.254
(Bubescu inhales deeply)

29:48.320 --> 29:49.455
(exhales)

29:51.223 --> 29:52.892
Now that I've got you wet...

29:52.959 --> 29:55.962
(chuckles) are you ready
to be fucked?

29:56.028 --> 29:57.763
Check this out,

29:57.830 --> 30:00.933
my own personal "boom"!

30:01.000 --> 30:02.634
Atomic bomb factory.

30:02.701 --> 30:06.772
1,600 tapes a week.

30:06.839 --> 30:07.874
(laughs)

30:07.940 --> 30:10.042
(imitates whooshing sound)

30:10.109 --> 30:13.212
Distributed
all over the country,

30:13.279 --> 30:16.215
straight into people's homes,

30:16.282 --> 30:20.086
where families and friends
gather to watch.

30:20.152 --> 30:24.490
Capitalist virtues
will spread like a virus

30:24.556 --> 30:27.126
and spread and spread and spread

30:27.193 --> 30:30.329
until the East
is turned into the West.

30:30.396 --> 30:31.497
(grunts)

30:31.563 --> 30:33.365
(whoops)

30:33.432 --> 30:35.134
-(moaning)
-CAMERAMAN: Okay, wow.

30:35.201 --> 30:36.602
-Yeah.
-SOUND MAN: Mm, that's good.

30:36.668 --> 30:37.769
CAMERAMAN:
That's so good.

30:37.836 --> 30:38.770
It is, yeah.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.240
Oh, that's so good.

30:41.307 --> 30:43.242
Yeah, yeah.

30:47.046 --> 30:49.081
(yawns loudly)

30:58.690 --> 31:03.462
So, I should, um--
I should go check on my friend.

31:03.529 --> 31:04.796
Okay, relax.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.465
Did Orzan tell you how we met?

31:06.532 --> 31:08.467
Orzan came to audition
for one of my films.

31:08.534 --> 31:10.169
-ORZAN: It's true.
-He was talentless.

31:10.236 --> 31:12.104
But he was meticulous,
I liked him.

31:12.171 --> 31:14.406
So I got him the job
as the projectionist

31:14.473 --> 31:16.909
at the cinema.

31:16.976 --> 31:19.678
By the way,
how did you two meet?

31:19.745 --> 31:20.879
ORZAN:
Uh, w-we...

31:20.947 --> 31:23.115
We go to the same cafe.

31:23.182 --> 31:25.251
-Oh, is that right?
-ORZAN: Yeah, yes.

31:25.317 --> 31:26.718
BUBESCU:
Let me tell you something.

31:26.785 --> 31:28.287
Finding a good projectionist

31:28.354 --> 31:30.589
-is harder than finding
a good actor. -ORZAN: Very true.

31:30.656 --> 31:34.326
An actor just needs to be able
to lie. As you must know...

31:34.393 --> 31:35.527
Uh-huh, uh.

31:35.594 --> 31:37.129
BUBESCU:
...the world is full of liars.

31:37.196 --> 31:41.000
Unfortunately for Orzan here,

31:41.067 --> 31:43.335
he can't lie for shit.

31:44.436 --> 31:46.973
(Orzan yelling)

31:47.039 --> 31:49.942
Creepy motherfucker.

31:50.009 --> 31:52.678
(Romanian song playing)

31:55.847 --> 31:57.583
(yells)

31:57.649 --> 31:59.018
(sighs)

31:59.085 --> 32:00.619
(gunshot in distance)

32:00.686 --> 32:02.421
Did you hear that?

32:02.488 --> 32:04.656
-(gunshot in distance)
-Oh, it's an ambush! -Duck!

32:07.859 --> 32:09.996
(Romanian song
continues playing)

32:23.075 --> 32:25.111
-(gunshots in distance)
-(gasps)

32:25.177 --> 32:27.579
No, no, no. Don't stop.
Finish the scene.

32:50.602 --> 32:52.071

CAMERAMAN: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who the fuck are you?

33:02.081 --> 33:03.982
This is a closed set.

33:04.683 --> 33:06.718
(whimpering)

33:11.023 --> 33:12.658
Joseph, come on, get up.

33:12.724 --> 33:15.027
Gregor, I saw him.

33:15.094 --> 33:16.195
Who?

33:16.262 --> 33:19.265
Him. He was here.

33:25.637 --> 33:28.740
It's not over
until I yell "cut"!

(gun clicks)

33:31.977 --> 33:33.512

33:33.579 --> 33:34.713
And scene.

33:36.582 --> 33:39.118
(gun clatters)

33:40.586 --> 33:42.188
Did I get him?

(panting)

34:00.406 --> 34:03.075
(dispatcher
speaking indistinctly)

34:03.142 --> 34:05.577
It's a damn war zone in there.

34:05.644 --> 34:09.348
In all my years, I've never seen
this kind of carnage.

34:09.415 --> 34:10.782
So?

34:10.849 --> 34:13.051
You saw the killer?

34:13.119 --> 34:15.221
Yes.

34:15.286 --> 34:17.422
He was in a room with me.

34:17.489 --> 34:19.824
And what were you doing
in the room?

34:19.891 --> 34:23.329
(sighing):
I was...

34:27.833 --> 34:30.136
I was being raped.

34:31.103 --> 34:33.038
What?

34:33.105 --> 34:35.440
The killer is sill out there,
Captain.

34:35.507 --> 34:38.810
So this massacre
was for nothing?

34:38.877 --> 34:42.781
Do you think we're in America,
where life is cheap?

34:42.848 --> 34:45.150
Ten of our fellow citizens
are dead in there,

34:45.217 --> 34:46.851
and you let the killer get away?

34:46.918 --> 34:49.888
He's been one step ahead of us
the entire time.

34:49.955 --> 34:51.322
You two are off the case.

34:51.389 --> 34:52.891
I'm giving this
to Stan and Dragos.

34:52.958 --> 34:54.360
Captain, no.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.628
You're no closer
to finding this person

34:56.695 --> 34:59.598
than the day Nikita
gave his life for his country.

34:59.665 --> 35:00.932
It's over.

35:00.999 --> 35:03.235
Go home.

35:04.203 --> 35:05.737

35:05.804 --> 35:07.739
He's right.

Joseph!

(exhales)

35:43.975 --> 35:46.312
You had a bad day?

35:48.180 --> 35:51.683
Yes, my love.

35:51.750 --> 35:54.920
Very bad.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.788
Sleep, Joseph.

35:56.855 --> 35:58.457
Get some rest.

35:58.524 --> 36:02.328
Things will look better
in the morning.

36:10.336 --> 36:12.904
ANDREI:
Daddy.

36:12.971 --> 36:14.506
Daddy!

36:14.573 --> 36:19.745
You told me once, Father,
that it is my duty to inform.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.650
Even if I had to inform
on loved ones.

36:24.716 --> 36:27.853
(laughs softly)
Yes, of course.

(whimpers)

36:31.156 --> 36:32.258
Captain?

36:32.324 --> 36:35.927
Joseph, you're under arrest.

36:35.994 --> 36:37.563
For what?

36:37.629 --> 36:40.966
For smuggling in Western goods.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.968
Men.

36:44.770 --> 36:45.804
(exhales)

36:45.871 --> 36:47.239
Joseph?

36:47.306 --> 36:49.975
Wait, t-there's been
some kind of mistake.

37:08.594 --> 37:11.597
Your son discovered all this
in the floorboards.

37:11.663 --> 37:13.865
He called us immediately.

37:13.932 --> 37:16.935
If nothing else,
you raisedonegood child.

37:17.002 --> 37:19.938
I'm not so sure about this one.

37:22.574 --> 37:23.942
-All right.
-JOSEPH: No.

37:24.009 --> 37:25.677
I've been set up. Captain!

37:25.744 --> 37:27.713
-No, this is some kind of setup.
-ANDREI: Papa...

37:27.779 --> 37:29.781
None of that stuff's mine,
I'm innocent!

37:29.848 --> 37:31.216

All right, all right.

All right, all right,
I'm coming!

38:10.255 --> 38:12.190
COVACI:
Hi.

38:12.257 --> 38:14.926
We just arrested Joseph.

38:14.993 --> 38:17.128
Uh... Huh.

38:17.195 --> 38:18.630
Seems the son of a bitch

38:18.697 --> 38:21.533
was part of the smuggling
operation all along.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.602
What the fuck
are you talking about?

38:23.669 --> 38:27.238
I'm assuming you didn't know.

38:27.305 --> 38:29.074
Joseph, corrupt?

38:29.140 --> 38:32.411
N-No, uh, I don't believe that.

38:32.478 --> 38:34.846
He fooled us all, Gregor.

38:34.913 --> 38:37.315
Now, look.

38:37.383 --> 38:40.552
We need to clear you,
and when we do,

38:40.619 --> 38:43.755
I want you to interrogate
Detective Baciu.

38:45.491 --> 38:46.758
No... No.

38:46.825 --> 38:49.628
No, now, you two
had a connection.

38:49.695 --> 38:54.165
Maybe he'll be more open
to confessing to you.

38:54.232 --> 38:56.034
(Covani laughs)

38:56.101 --> 38:57.335
Company?

38:57.403 --> 38:59.037
Hey, get up!

38:59.104 --> 39:02.474
Come on, lady, time to go.

39:02.541 --> 39:04.543
Who is she?

39:06.177 --> 39:08.113
I don't remember.

39:08.179 --> 39:11.383
Hey. Lady, rise and shine.

39:11.450 --> 39:13.084
Let's go.

39:13.151 --> 39:14.319
Get up.

39:14.386 --> 39:16.888
Come on, honey, get up.

39:16.955 --> 39:18.690
What...

39:26.432 --> 39:28.366
It's Tatyana Popescu.

39:28.434 --> 39:29.668
No...

39:29.735 --> 39:32.504
I just found her.
(gun clicks)

39:32.571 --> 39:34.940
Let's go. Get your hands
where I can see them.

39:35.006 --> 39:38.410
-I-I didn't do that.
-Hands where I can see them.

39:38.477 --> 39:40.011
I didn't do that!

39:40.078 --> 39:41.480
Don't worry.

39:41.547 --> 39:44.382
I'll send you meatballs
in prison.

39:46.685 --> 39:47.986
(handcuffs jingling)

39:48.053 --> 39:49.988
Let's go.

Let's go.
