WEBVTT

00:06.440 --> 00:09.008
Base command:
<i>Tango, check on a camera outage</i>
<i> along perimeter three.</i>

00:09.010 --> 00:10.409
<i> Copy?</i>

00:10.411 --> 00:11.477
Copy that, command.

00:11.479 --> 00:13.078
Tango out.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.047
So you gonna
answer this question?

00:15.049 --> 00:18.250
Only one food you get to live on
for the rest of your life.

00:18.252 --> 00:20.085
Easy.
New england clam chowder.

00:20.087 --> 00:22.087
Ew. Really?

00:22.089 --> 00:23.188
You don't like chowder?

00:23.190 --> 00:25.124
I do, but come on--

00:25.126 --> 00:27.059
every meal, every day?

00:27.061 --> 00:28.460
Oh, the creamy kind...

00:28.462 --> 00:31.130
No way I'd get tired of it.
You?

00:31.132 --> 00:32.264
Pizza.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.465
Oh, right.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.134
Pizza. Damn.

00:35.136 --> 00:38.103
Is it too late
to change my answer?
You can change it

00:38.105 --> 00:40.305
100 times, finny.
No one's got a gun to your head.

00:40.307 --> 00:43.142
But I do have pizza in my head
now, thank you very much.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.209
Yum.

00:44.211 --> 00:45.677
What the hell?

00:45.679 --> 00:47.346
Finn:
<i> Hey, this doesn't look right.</i>

00:47.348 --> 00:48.514
(Siren whoops)

00:51.218 --> 00:52.217
Finn:
Halt!

00:52.219 --> 00:54.153
Hands where I can see them!

00:54.155 --> 00:55.187
Whoa.

00:55.189 --> 00:56.455
Look, it's all good.

00:56.457 --> 00:57.689
We're just fixing
the fence.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.526
Command said nothing about that.

01:00.528 --> 01:02.227
We got a call from your hq.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.595
Looks like some joker

01:03.597 --> 01:05.464
with a wire cutter
was trying to ruin your night.

01:05.466 --> 01:07.132
What's with the crates?

01:07.134 --> 01:09.134
It's equipment.

01:09.136 --> 01:10.602
Look, I can show you
the work order. I got it...

01:10.604 --> 01:11.770
Stop! Hands!

01:13.074 --> 01:14.073
I'll come to you!

01:16.210 --> 01:18.210
Tango to command, come back.

01:18.212 --> 01:20.279
We're about
done here anyway.

01:20.281 --> 01:21.613
Base command: Tango, this is
base. Status report?

01:21.615 --> 01:22.614
Female officer: Just checking
into something now.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.283
Stand by for update.

01:25.219 --> 01:27.352
You don't look done.

01:28.289 --> 01:29.721
And that's not equipment.

01:29.723 --> 01:31.290
Finn: Call it in!

01:31.292 --> 01:32.424
Finn!

01:32.426 --> 01:34.259
Base command:
Tango, report.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.394
Leave it!

01:35.396 --> 01:37.329
Tango?

01:37.331 --> 01:39.565
They can't help you now.

01:39.567 --> 01:40.432
Finn?

01:40.434 --> 01:42.301
Finn's gone, missy.

01:42.303 --> 01:45.304
There's no need
for you to go with him.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.473
Tango, report!

01:47.475 --> 01:48.807
(Clicks tongue)

01:54.615 --> 01:58.383
¶ ¶

02:25.346 --> 02:29.148
taft: ...So, when i
snuck home that night,

02:29.150 --> 02:30.782
there he was, waiting
on the front porch.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.251
(Laughs)

02:32.253 --> 02:33.418
You know, I still,
uh, I still get

02:33.420 --> 02:34.920
a knot in my chest
just thinking about it.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.755
I mean, understand,

02:36.757 --> 02:39.591
my dad never
hit us, you know.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.460
His weapon of choice
was disappointment.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.595
And whenever
i screwed up,

02:43.597 --> 02:45.731
he could throw
a disappointed look

02:45.733 --> 02:48.433
across a room
like a Joe Willie spiral.

02:48.435 --> 02:50.169
And honestly,
I'd rather get hit

02:50.171 --> 02:52.337
with a sack of nickels
than that.

02:52.339 --> 02:53.939
So, uh...

02:53.941 --> 02:55.374
How was your dad?

02:55.376 --> 02:57.442
Was he much of a disciplinarian?

02:59.380 --> 03:01.180
You know it's your move, right?

03:04.385 --> 03:06.351
Giving up your
queen that easy?

03:06.353 --> 03:08.287
Screw my queen, Gibbs.

03:08.289 --> 03:09.821
Quid pro quo.

03:09.823 --> 03:12.324
I open up a revealing window
into my childhood,

03:12.326 --> 03:13.959
you open one up, too.

03:13.961 --> 03:16.295
No. That's not the deal.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.430
So screw our deal, too.

03:18.432 --> 03:20.399
I said I would talk.

03:20.401 --> 03:23.502
No head shrinking
and no "opening windows."

03:23.504 --> 03:25.237
And no progress.

03:25.239 --> 03:26.471
I'd learn just as much about you

03:26.473 --> 03:27.873
playing chess on my computer.

03:27.875 --> 03:31.410
Okay.

03:31.412 --> 03:32.844
What do you want to know?

03:32.846 --> 03:34.580
Honestly...

03:34.582 --> 03:36.415
I really want to know
if you'd be willing

03:36.417 --> 03:38.250
to see an actual therapist.

03:38.252 --> 03:40.319
No. What for?

03:40.321 --> 03:42.287
What for? You were shot,

03:42.289 --> 03:43.655
you suffered trauma,
much of it unseen.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.424
Am I ringing any bells here?

03:45.426 --> 03:47.559
We agreed I don't need therapy.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.361
Uh, no,<i> you</i> agreed.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.395
And I think you'd feel
differently about grace.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.763
My therapist.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.332
And I know she gets
a kick out of you.

03:53.334 --> 03:56.501
Your therapist knows about me?

03:56.503 --> 03:58.237
Oh, I spend far
too many sessions

03:58.239 --> 03:59.438
talking about you lately.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.506
Why do you talk about me?

04:01.508 --> 04:02.841
(Laughs)

04:02.843 --> 04:05.844
It's not so much
about you, per se.

04:05.846 --> 04:09.915
It's more about my unhealthy
attachment to positive results.

04:09.917 --> 04:13.619
It's not at all helpful
in my chosen field,

04:13.621 --> 04:17.022
since no surgeon
bats a thousand.

04:17.024 --> 04:20.392
So whenever I hit a wall,
or, in this case, you,

04:20.394 --> 04:23.629
it tends to bring up a whole
host of unresolved issues.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.664
Stop talking about me.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.499
Let me introduce you to grace

04:27.501 --> 04:29.835
and I won't have to anymore.

04:29.837 --> 04:33.472
(Two phones ringing)

04:33.941 --> 04:35.474
Gibbs.
Yes?

04:35.476 --> 04:36.608
(Two voices on the phones,
speaking indistinctly)

04:36.610 --> 04:38.477
Where?
How many wounded?

04:39.480 --> 04:40.712
I'm on my way.
On my way.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.614
Shooting in Reston?

04:42.616 --> 04:44.549
Naval ops center.

04:44.551 --> 04:46.318
To be continued, then.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.387
Ha!

04:53.494 --> 04:55.994
Gibbs: Bishop?
You the first one here?

04:55.996 --> 04:57.529
I live closest.

04:57.531 --> 04:58.664
Tony and McGee
are en route.

04:58.666 --> 05:00.399
Ducky, too.

05:00.401 --> 05:01.700
This our only victim?

05:01.702 --> 05:03.402
So far.

05:03.404 --> 05:06.305
Petty officer first class
Lamar Finn.

05:06.307 --> 05:07.706
His fellow master-at-arms,

05:07.708 --> 05:08.940
petty officer first class
Janet shor,

05:08.942 --> 05:10.075
was rushed to Walter Reed,

05:10.077 --> 05:11.877
along with one of the shooters.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.378
Gsws on both.

05:13.380 --> 05:14.413
Witnesses?

05:14.415 --> 05:15.714
Surveillance?

05:15.716 --> 05:17.416
Cameras had just gone down.

05:17.418 --> 05:20.319
Personnel inside the compound
heard multiple gunshots

05:20.321 --> 05:22.654
and at least one
vehicle speed away.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.490
Whoever it was, they knew how
to get what they were after.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.426
What'd they get?

05:27.428 --> 05:30.329
Uh, 15 to 20 crates,

05:30.331 --> 05:33.832
each containing a dozen
m-16 rifles.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.501
And a few thousand rounds
of ammo to go with.

05:36.503 --> 05:37.536
(Phone beeps,
phone line rings)

05:37.538 --> 05:39.004
Here comes ducky.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.605
Yeah, go give him
a hand, huh?

05:40.607 --> 05:42.341
(Phone beeps)

05:42.343 --> 05:44.509
Gibbs. That was quick.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.345
Change your mind
about my shrink already?

05:46.347 --> 05:47.946
Hey, doc, you in surgery yet?

05:47.948 --> 05:49.381
I'm about to be.

05:49.383 --> 05:50.782
The petty officer?

05:50.784 --> 05:52.484
Uh, no, she's still
with the trauma team.

05:52.486 --> 05:53.518
No update on her yet.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.120
The shooter.

05:55.122 --> 05:56.988
That... is the card that
I've just been dealt.

05:56.990 --> 06:00.459
Unidentified male assailant
with massive gunshot wounds.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.094
I'm gonna want to talk to him.

06:02.096 --> 06:03.829
I don't know.
He's pretty jacked up.

06:03.831 --> 06:05.697
You keep him alive
until I get there, doc.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.399
I'll do what I can.

06:07.401 --> 06:08.500
No, doc.

06:08.502 --> 06:09.901
You keep him alive.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.603
(Taking deep breath)

06:26.453 --> 06:27.686
Hi. Excuse me.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.821
Looking for Dr. taft.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.556
I believe he is
still in surgery.

06:31.558 --> 06:32.691
Something I can
help you with?

06:32.693 --> 06:34.793
Petty officer Janet shor.
I just left her.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.862
She's been upgraded to
"critical but stable."

06:36.864 --> 06:38.463
Apparently, she put up
quite a fight.

06:38.465 --> 06:40.866
Gibbs, what are you, uh...?

06:40.868 --> 06:42.734
Uh, yeah. Our shooter.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.603
Oh. Well, the, uh,

06:44.605 --> 06:46.438
the damage to his aorta
was pretty severe.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.739
He lost a lot of blood.

06:47.741 --> 06:48.974
Well, what then?

06:48.976 --> 06:50.008
What then what?

06:50.010 --> 06:51.443
He's dead, Gibbs.

06:51.445 --> 06:52.544
Wait.

06:52.546 --> 06:53.812
You lost him?

06:53.814 --> 06:55.747
Excuse me?

06:55.749 --> 06:58.884
Doc, we've got an arsenal
of stolen weapons out there,

06:58.886 --> 07:00.752
and he's the only guy
who knows where they went.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.120
Well, sorry to run out

07:02.122 --> 07:03.555
of miracles on you, Gibbs.
Well, what?

07:03.557 --> 07:05.056
Did he say anything?
Did he ever wake up?

07:05.058 --> 07:06.792
Uh, barely-- he was just
mumbling to himself.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.126
What'd he mumble?

07:08.128 --> 07:09.494
Ah, wasn't in English.

07:09.496 --> 07:11.563
Uh, sounded European.
Maybe German?

07:13.834 --> 07:16.067
Tony:
Fritz beimler, 37.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.502
He's been a wanted man
in his native fatherland

07:17.504 --> 07:19.021
for quite
a few years now.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.539
Wanted for racketeering,
robbery,

07:20.541 --> 07:22.441
counterfeiting,
drug smuggling...

07:22.443 --> 07:24.743
McGee:
Interpol's been tracking
him for about a year,

07:24.745 --> 07:26.578
they lost him four
months ago in Zaire.

07:26.580 --> 07:29.848
From outlaw in Africa to
stealing military m-16s here.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.517
Guy's a regular
Fritz of all trades.

07:32.519 --> 07:34.019
Any word on
petty officer shor?

07:34.021 --> 07:35.554
No, we called earlier.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.522
She is stable,
but still unconscious.

07:37.524 --> 07:39.691
Uh, you might
want to call again.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.526
I just left there
and she's not only awake,

07:41.528 --> 07:44.029
but remarkably alert,
considering her injuries.

07:44.031 --> 07:46.198
McGee, bishop,
go talk to her.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.666
DiNozzo,
keep digging on beimler.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.534
And why are you here?

07:49.536 --> 07:52.838
Oh, and, uh,
good morning to you, too.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.606
Well, it looks like you've
i.D.'D my latest failure.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.508
Least I was right
about the German part.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.610
Yeah, doc,
about that...
Ah, ah, ah.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.479
You know, it's not you
i came to see, Gibbs.

08:00.481 --> 08:02.948
I'm here for
your good Dr. Mallard.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.016
Ducky? What for?

08:05.018 --> 08:06.952
Again with the "what fors."

08:06.954 --> 08:08.487
Must I really explain
everything to you?

08:08.489 --> 08:09.955
You do if you want to see ducky.

08:13.727 --> 08:17.028
Um, something I noticed
during surgery.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.964
Could be nothing, but...

08:18.966 --> 08:20.932
Has he been autopsied yet?

08:25.072 --> 08:27.706
Petty officer Finn
never had a chance.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.608
Death was instantaneous.

08:29.610 --> 08:33.578
He absorbed a high-caliber round
at point-blank range.

08:33.580 --> 08:34.713
Abby's got the bullet?

08:34.715 --> 08:36.248
Well, yeah, they
managed to recover it.

08:36.250 --> 08:38.884
She's running
ballistics as we speak.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.986
To what do I owe the pleasure,
Dr. taft?

08:40.988 --> 08:42.787
Cyril, please.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.623
I was just hoping to get a,
a quick second look

08:44.625 --> 08:47.058
at an odd scar
on your shooter's arm.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.995
Yes, that caught
my eye as well.

08:49.997 --> 08:51.763
Here, let me
check the X-ray.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.064
Odd how, doc?

08:53.066 --> 08:54.699
Well, for one thing,
it's awful.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.202
Sloppy lines,
hastily stitched.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.738
That is at least six months old.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.306
Ducky: And stitched
with something

09:01.308 --> 09:03.074
other than
sterile suture thread.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.210
Exactly, like, uh, fishing line

09:05.212 --> 09:06.678
or common sewing thread.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.647
It covers that metal plate

09:08.649 --> 09:11.182
that's screwed
to his radius.

09:11.184 --> 09:13.818
A bit large for the task,
don't you think?

09:13.820 --> 09:15.820
Uh, yes, i-i do think.

09:15.822 --> 09:17.989
Oh, wow. Wow.

09:17.991 --> 09:20.025
Hell, I can actually
feel it under there.

09:20.027 --> 09:21.593
Duck, get it out.

09:21.595 --> 09:23.662
So it's not nothing, right?

09:23.664 --> 09:24.896
It's, uh, something.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.598
Something you can use?

09:26.600 --> 09:28.166
Well, yeah,
we'll take any lead we can get,

09:28.168 --> 09:30.068
including the hack
who put it in here.

09:30.070 --> 09:33.838
Would you care
to do the honors, cyril?

09:33.840 --> 09:36.575
Oh. That would be
just ducky, ducky.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.176
I've been dying
to say that.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.778
Well, you'd hardly
be the first.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.046
Jethro?

09:41.048 --> 09:42.647
Duck, get it out.

09:42.649 --> 09:43.982
Get it up to Abby
as quick as you can.

09:46.353 --> 09:47.652
Yeah.

09:49.623 --> 09:50.689
Hi.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.624
McGee:
Petty officer shor?

09:52.626 --> 09:56.227
NCIS special agents
McGee and bishop.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.662
Is this a bad time?

09:57.664 --> 09:59.364
No, we were just...

09:59.366 --> 10:00.799
Just finishing up.

10:01.868 --> 10:03.034
Agent Earl kitt, atf.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.804
If there's anything else

10:05.806 --> 10:07.772
you can think of,
Janet, give us a call.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.341
Okay.
I'm glad you're okay.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.280
You guys
getting anywhere?

10:15.282 --> 10:17.616
Just getting started.
You?

10:17.618 --> 10:19.250
Ah, same.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.620
Stolen guns are our business

10:21.622 --> 10:23.254
and a dead Navy kid is yours,

10:23.256 --> 10:25.023
so let's keep each other
in the loop?

10:26.226 --> 10:29.260
Nothing wrong with a little
interagency cooperation.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.363
Amen to that.
I'll be in touch.

10:31.365 --> 10:33.398
All right?
Okay.

10:33.400 --> 10:36.134
Sorry to barrage you
with more questions, Janet.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.803
I just can't believe it.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.640
Me and finny were just
goofing around, like always,

10:41.642 --> 10:43.975
and the last thing
i said to him...

10:43.977 --> 10:46.978
That no one had
a gun to his head...

10:46.980 --> 10:50.682
It's one of those
things you sort of say
without thinking and...

10:50.684 --> 10:53.752
The next thing I knew, he...

10:53.754 --> 10:55.820
It's okay, Janet.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.223
"Finn's gone."

10:58.225 --> 10:59.324
(Wry laugh)

10:59.326 --> 11:00.792
That's what he said to me.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.161
With a smile on his face.

11:03.163 --> 11:06.064
Was it this man who said it?

11:06.066 --> 11:08.333
No.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.236
The one doing
all the talking.

11:11.238 --> 11:13.204
He called me "missy."

11:13.206 --> 11:14.706
I can still see

11:14.708 --> 11:17.008
his face winking at me so clear.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.411
Clear enough
to describe him, maybe?

11:20.814 --> 11:22.847
Yeah.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.218
Talk to me, Abbs.
Gibbs!

11:27.220 --> 11:29.354
Don't burst in on me
like that.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.422
It's how I always burst in.

11:30.424 --> 11:31.890
You're right.

11:31.892 --> 11:33.725
That was just
before this titanium plate

11:33.727 --> 11:34.693
got me all freaked out.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.061
Got you freaked out how?

11:36.063 --> 11:37.962
Well, our dueling doctors
were right.

11:37.964 --> 11:40.799
The plate was made
for a much larger bone--

11:40.801 --> 11:42.367
a femur, to be exact.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.968
That's not too freaky.
Yeah.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.770
Just hold on.

11:45.772 --> 11:48.807
So, the serial number says
that it was manufactured

11:48.809 --> 11:50.141
in des moines, Iowa,

11:50.143 --> 11:52.844
in 1995.
'95?

11:52.846 --> 11:55.113
Yeah, it's a 21-year-old plate,
Gibbs,

11:55.115 --> 11:56.815
that somehow ended up
in your shooter

11:56.817 --> 11:57.882
as recently as last year.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.050
Where was it all that time?

11:59.052 --> 12:01.453
Father carlin.

12:01.455 --> 12:02.454
Who's that?

12:02.456 --> 12:05.190
According to the des moines lab,

12:05.192 --> 12:08.893
it was implanted by
a Dallas orthopedic surgeon

12:08.895 --> 12:10.895
to repair the
broken left femur

12:10.897 --> 12:14.299
of a catholic priest
named carlin.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.301
No first name listed.

12:16.303 --> 12:18.336
Freaky.

12:18.338 --> 12:19.504
Freaky's the word, boss.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.239
You find him yet?

12:21.241 --> 12:23.775
Well, I have found two
father carlins listed in Texas.

12:23.777 --> 12:24.876
I'm just figuring out
which one's ours.

12:24.878 --> 12:26.311
Did I just hear right?

12:26.313 --> 12:27.846
Abby just told me and
ducky that the, uh...

12:27.848 --> 12:29.164
You're still with ducky?

12:29.165 --> 12:30.481
...the plate that we
pulled out of beimler

12:30.484 --> 12:32.183
was originally
in somebody else?

12:32.185 --> 12:33.218
Got him.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.953
Father girard carlin.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.888
One of two brothers
in the priesthood.

12:36.890 --> 12:40.358
This one was injured in
a motorcycle accident in 1995.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.260
Oh, yeah, that's our guy.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.928
He still in Texas?

12:45.098 --> 12:46.898
Tony: No.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.767
Not according
to this memorial page.

12:48.769 --> 12:51.102
Says he left Texas in '98
to pursue missionary work in...

12:53.006 --> 12:54.205
Huh.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.341
What, DiNozzo? Where?

12:56.343 --> 12:58.176
Tony: Family lost contact
with him in '03.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.844
Listed him missing in '04.

12:59.846 --> 13:00.979
He's now presumed dead.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.947
Well, he's dead where?

13:02.949 --> 13:04.983
In the Sudan, boss.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.819
South Sudan?

13:07.821 --> 13:09.788
Yeah.

13:09.790 --> 13:10.989
American missionary work
anywhere in Africa

13:10.991 --> 13:12.090
is hardly unusual.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.491
True, doc, but this is

13:13.493 --> 13:15.426
our second Africa reference
of the day.

13:15.428 --> 13:18.163
The first was beimler in Zaire,
and now this.

13:18.165 --> 13:22.467
Ah, and what doctors do we know
with experience in the Sudan?

13:22.469 --> 13:24.836
Taft: Oh, hey,
what about our friends

13:24.838 --> 13:26.004
in the international
doctors' group--

13:26.006 --> 13:27.839
the-the ones you rescued.

13:27.841 --> 13:29.941
Uh, David woods
and his wife Jeanne?

13:29.943 --> 13:31.442
There's no way
they're involved, boss.

13:31.444 --> 13:32.744
I didn't say they were.

13:32.745 --> 13:34.045
Well, of course not,
but they might know people

13:34.047 --> 13:35.280
who might know people.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.015
And right now, we don't have

13:37.017 --> 13:39.818
a whole hell of a lot else
to go on, do we, DiNozzo?

13:39.820 --> 13:41.820
No, we don't, boss.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.121
Uh, mind if I tag along?

13:43.123 --> 13:44.889
I can explain the medical side

13:44.891 --> 13:46.157
of this little mystery
better than either of you.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.993
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

13:48.995 --> 13:50.995
No. Maybe.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.063
Kind of.

13:52.065 --> 13:54.232
Okay, the more the merrier, doc.

13:54.234 --> 13:58.069
Come on. I can use all
the buffer I can get.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.517
All right.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.385
Just don't offer
too much info, okay?

14:14.387 --> 14:15.987
I'll do the talking,
and then I'll cue you

14:15.989 --> 14:17.889
when it's time
for the medical lingo.

14:17.891 --> 14:21.426
So, uh, how long
were you two dating?

14:23.129 --> 14:24.495
Does her husband know?

14:24.497 --> 14:26.397
Who told you?

14:26.399 --> 14:28.366
Mm, no one.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.102
You were clearly reluctant
to come here-- not to mention

14:31.104 --> 14:33.104
how many times you checked your
teeth in the rearview mirror.

14:33.106 --> 14:35.506
(Sighs)
Well, I don't think David knows.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.041
I mean,
i-i haven't talked to him

14:37.043 --> 14:39.093
since we got back from Africa,

14:39.094 --> 14:41.144
but I don't want
anything breaking the truce.

14:41.147 --> 14:42.580
Agent DiNozzo.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.148
Dr. woods.

14:44.150 --> 14:46.050
Cyril taft, long time.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.352
Oh, too long.

14:47.353 --> 14:48.653
Great to see you, uh,
in the flesh, David--

14:48.655 --> 14:50.455
alive and well.

14:50.457 --> 14:51.890
Yeah, well,
thanks to these guys.

14:51.892 --> 14:53.191
And, uh, how's your wife,

14:53.193 --> 14:54.893
uh, the other Dr. woods?

14:54.895 --> 14:56.261
Uh, Jeanne, is it?

14:56.263 --> 14:58.062
Yeah, she's great.
Out running errands.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.264
If you can stick around,

14:59.266 --> 15:00.899
I know she'd love to see you.

15:02.168 --> 15:03.668
Oh, maybe next time.
We're just here

15:03.670 --> 15:06.137
to tap your resources,
and we'll be on our way.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.906
(Clears throat)

15:09.009 --> 15:11.142
What resources?

15:11.144 --> 15:12.043
Back already.

15:12.045 --> 15:14.145
(Chuckles) Perfect timing.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.280
Jeanne:
Yeah, perfect.

15:15.282 --> 15:17.215
Dr. taft.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.182
(Quiet laugh)

15:19.319 --> 15:21.486
Tony.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.688
Hi, Jeanne.

15:23.690 --> 15:26.658
David: And you guys pulled this
off some bad guy's radius?

15:26.660 --> 15:28.192
Seems kind of big.

15:28.194 --> 15:29.627
Big and old.

15:29.629 --> 15:30.695
Previously on the femur

15:30.697 --> 15:31.930
of a missionary priest

15:31.932 --> 15:33.097
who went missing in the Sudan

15:33.099 --> 15:34.032
about 12 years ago.

15:34.034 --> 15:36.067
The Sudan.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.535
That's what led you to us?

15:37.537 --> 15:39.938
Just on the off chance
that you might know doctors

15:39.940 --> 15:41.572
over there who perform
these kinds of procedures.

15:41.574 --> 15:45.076
And rob graves
for recycled parts?

15:45.078 --> 15:47.211
Well, it's not like we haven't
seen this before, Jeanne.

15:47.213 --> 15:49.714
Fairly common
in third-world areas

15:49.716 --> 15:52.383
low on supplies-- it's
whatever works over there.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.085
Well, it's not the recyclers
we're after.

15:54.087 --> 15:57.455
It's the doctor who put the
recycled part in our bad guy.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.724
Taft: Hoping they can,
uh, point us

15:59.726 --> 16:01.125
to some
of the bad guy's friends.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.727
I'd be happy to call
the doctors

16:02.729 --> 16:04.662
that we know over there
and see who knows what.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.130
Appreciate that.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.231
You kidding me?

16:07.233 --> 16:09.167
After what you guys did for us?

16:09.169 --> 16:11.269
Yeah, I've been wanting to
invite you and agent McGee

16:11.271 --> 16:13.171
out for a big dinner
sometime.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.272
Oh, no, that's not necessary.

16:14.274 --> 16:15.273
Jeanne: Not necessary.

16:15.275 --> 16:16.307
I keep telling David

16:16.309 --> 16:18.109
you were just doing your jobs.

16:18.111 --> 16:21.279
I was just doing my job.

16:21.281 --> 16:24.015
(Chuckles) Okay, well,

16:24.017 --> 16:25.350
I'm gonna have to think
of something else.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.986
We owe you our lives,
after all.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.420
Uh, one more thing--
i hope you don't mind

16:29.422 --> 16:31.489
me asking--
what'd your bad guy do, anyway?

16:31.491 --> 16:33.091
Oh, uh, killed
a young petty officer

16:33.093 --> 16:36.227
and stole a bunch of guns,
apparently.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.295
Wait, what?

16:37.297 --> 16:39.230
Uh, no, Jeanne, that's not...

16:39.232 --> 16:40.431
Stolen weapons, Tony?

16:40.433 --> 16:41.632
Is that why you're here?

16:41.634 --> 16:43.434
No, Jeanne, it isn't.

16:43.436 --> 16:46.204
Look, it never even
crossed our mind.

16:46.206 --> 16:49.374
Are you saying that this
is about your father?

16:49.376 --> 16:52.176
No. Look, I swear to you,

16:52.178 --> 16:55.513
this is about doctors
in Africa.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.582
It has nothing to do
with your father.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.417
Yeah, okay.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.586
Fine. Excuse me.

17:03.590 --> 17:04.655
Uh...

17:06.226 --> 17:07.525
All right, well, look,

17:07.527 --> 17:08.760
I'll make these calls for you.

17:08.762 --> 17:10.428
I'll get back to you.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.063
All right?

17:12.065 --> 17:13.264
Talk soon.

17:13.266 --> 17:15.299
Thank you.

17:18.304 --> 17:20.304
So, what's this
about her father?

17:23.309 --> 17:24.375
<i> (Elevator bell chimes)</i>

17:28.281 --> 17:29.647
Jeanne benoit? Really?

17:29.649 --> 17:31.482
How'd it go, Tony? You okay?

17:31.484 --> 17:35.753
Well, aside from taft
verbally ripping the bandage

17:35.755 --> 17:38.489
off a very delicate wound,
it was super awesome, thanks.

17:38.491 --> 17:39.824
What about her husband David?

17:39.826 --> 17:41.225
That weird?

17:41.227 --> 17:42.560
Not at all.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.095
He's a lovely guy.

17:44.097 --> 17:45.730
In fact, he wants
to take us out

17:45.732 --> 17:49.333
for a fancy dinner to thank us
for saving his life in Africa.

17:49.335 --> 17:51.302
Excellent.
Can I bring Delilah?

17:51.304 --> 17:53.071
In place of me, absolutely.

17:53.073 --> 17:54.856
Update on the hospital.

17:54.857 --> 17:56.640
Uh, petty officer shor
gave us a great description

17:56.643 --> 17:58.376
of one of the suspects.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.244
Abby's running
facial recognition now.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.213
She also remembered a lot of
details about the vehicle.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.115
Black step-up Van,
Maryland plates.

18:04.117 --> 18:05.716
I already put out a bolo.
Good.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.118
How about you?

18:08.088 --> 18:09.487
It weird, her and the husband?

18:09.489 --> 18:11.255
Do you really want to know?

18:11.257 --> 18:13.324
No.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.127
They give us anything?
Not much,

18:16.129 --> 18:17.495
but they're eager to help.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.097
They're calling their network
in Africa

18:19.099 --> 18:20.398
for any possible leads.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.267
Taft? You sent him home.

18:23.269 --> 18:24.869
Are you kidding?

18:24.871 --> 18:27.705
You are not gonna
believe this, Gibbs.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.373
There's a lot
i don't believe, doc.

18:29.375 --> 18:30.708
Look what ducky found

18:30.710 --> 18:33.344
lodged beside beimler's
l5 vertebrae.

18:33.346 --> 18:35.213
Another bullet
from the shooting?

18:35.215 --> 18:36.581
Not last night's shooting.

18:36.583 --> 18:37.782
Ducky:
The scar tissue indicates

18:37.784 --> 18:40.685
that it's been
encapsulated there for years.

18:40.687 --> 18:43.254
Likely left there
by a surgeon,

18:43.256 --> 18:45.523
not wanting to risk
paralysis by removing it.

18:45.525 --> 18:47.558
Old bullets, titanium plates.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.528
This was a bad-ass cat
on his tenth life, Gibbs.

18:50.530 --> 18:54.432
I didn't lose him,
it was finally his time to go.

18:54.434 --> 18:57.335
You're still on that, doc?
Get over it, come on.
Ducky: Jethro, Abby

18:57.337 --> 18:58.769
came up empty
on the first bullet.

18:58.771 --> 19:01.305
Perhaps this one
could prove fortuitous.

19:01.307 --> 19:02.807
I'll drop it by on my way out.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.542
Your way out?
You're leaving?

19:04.544 --> 19:06.711
Yeah, we both are.
You hungry?

19:09.682 --> 19:13.217
I had no idea, Gibbs, I mean,
the thrill of the investigation.

19:13.219 --> 19:14.852
I-i think I may have
missed my calling.

19:14.854 --> 19:17.321
You want to be a cop now?

19:17.323 --> 19:18.456
Uh, doctor-slash-cop.

19:18.458 --> 19:19.624
Why not?

19:19.626 --> 19:21.192
It's... it certainly would be

19:21.194 --> 19:22.627
a happier hobby
than being your therapist.

19:22.629 --> 19:23.861
Here it comes.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.363
Uh, speaking of
which, have you,

19:25.365 --> 19:26.898
uh, given my
suggestion any thought?

19:26.900 --> 19:29.167
Yes, in all my free time.

19:29.169 --> 19:31.536
At last,
the infamous agent Gibbs.

19:32.438 --> 19:33.938
Lady... save your breath.

19:33.940 --> 19:36.608
You're barking up
the wrong tree.

19:36.609 --> 19:39.277
Oh, Gibbs...
Look, if you want
to quit, quit, okay?

19:39.279 --> 19:40.745
I don't need you.
I don't need your shrink.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.246
I-i don't need

19:42.248 --> 19:44.282
whoever would take your place.

19:44.284 --> 19:46.250
Gibbs, this is Catherine.

19:46.252 --> 19:47.818
My wife.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.489
Sorry to crash your guy time.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.224
(Phone buzzes)

19:53.226 --> 19:54.492
Oh, my office.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.527
Why don't you two
get acquainted.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.429
(Phone buzzing continues)

19:58.431 --> 19:59.497
(Phone beeps on)

20:02.569 --> 20:04.936
(Clears throat)
Bad start.

20:09.275 --> 20:10.925
It's all in how you finish.

20:10.926 --> 20:12.576
So, you know, cyril doesn't
tell me much, but I...

20:12.579 --> 20:15.446
Understand that we do have
a few things in common.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.449
Some personal loss?

20:19.886 --> 20:22.453
Not as recent as yours.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.355
Yeah, well...

20:24.357 --> 20:26.390
There's no clock on it.

20:26.392 --> 20:29.560
I mean, time heals, right?

20:29.562 --> 20:32.296
But never enough.

20:32.298 --> 20:35.266
Look, before he
comes back, I just...

20:35.268 --> 20:38.436
I just wanted to thank you real
quick for being cyril's friend.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.407
We've been through a lot
since losing Paul.

20:43.409 --> 20:46.344
And, um, well, i
think this sparring

20:46.346 --> 20:49.247
that you guys do--
it's good for him.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.382
You're good for him, Gibbs.

20:51.384 --> 20:52.450
Very good.

20:52.452 --> 20:56.254
Not as good as he's been for me.

20:56.256 --> 20:57.822
Not that you're gonna
tell him that.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.323
Oh, no.

20:59.325 --> 21:00.758
His head's already big enough.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.494
Okay, that's enough
about me-- scooch.

21:03.496 --> 21:04.996
(Phone rings)

21:04.998 --> 21:05.997
(Phone beeps on)

21:05.999 --> 21:07.498
Don't you guys ever get a break?

21:07.500 --> 21:09.467
Hey, bishop.
What do you got?

21:09.469 --> 21:11.969
(Siren wails in distance)

21:11.971 --> 21:14.572
Bishop: Metro pd found it
off our bolo.

21:14.574 --> 21:16.340
No sign of the
m-16 crates,

21:16.342 --> 21:18.009
but we did find blood
in the front seat.

21:18.011 --> 21:20.378
Beimler wasn't the only one hit.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.513
Looks that way.
All right.

21:22.515 --> 21:23.814
Dust for prints.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.916
(Phone ringing)
Give 'em to Abby
to comb through.

21:25.918 --> 21:27.401
Wait, hold on.

21:27.402 --> 21:28.885
Abby's calling.
Speak of the devil.

21:28.888 --> 21:30.721
Hey, were your ears burning?

21:30.723 --> 21:33.057
Why? Who are you talking to?

21:33.059 --> 21:34.492
Gibbs and bishop.

21:34.494 --> 21:36.460
We're in an alley
downtown.

21:36.462 --> 21:37.528
We found the Van.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.530
Well, can you leave?

21:39.532 --> 21:41.565
I need to talk to you-- you,

21:41.567 --> 21:43.501
and Gibbs.

21:44.604 --> 21:45.870
Gibbs:
What is it, Abbs?

21:45.872 --> 21:47.605
Tony: That you couldn't
say on the phone?

21:47.607 --> 21:49.473
It's about the
bullet that ducky

21:49.475 --> 21:51.542
pulled from
beimler's spine.

21:51.544 --> 21:53.911
There's
a signature notch on it

21:53.913 --> 21:55.813
that I was able
to trace to a batch

21:55.815 --> 21:57.548
that was already in our system.

21:57.550 --> 21:58.482
"Our system"?

21:58.484 --> 22:00.017
You mean it's one of ours?

22:00.019 --> 22:02.820
No, it was part
of a stolen batch

22:02.822 --> 22:04.655
that we had recorded
as evidence.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.957
In our system almost as long

22:06.959 --> 22:08.659
as the bullet
was in beimler.

22:08.661 --> 22:09.794
What are you saying, Abby?

22:09.796 --> 22:11.495
Well, I never wanted

22:11.497 --> 22:15.533
to say this name
ever, ever again.

22:15.535 --> 22:17.034
But the bullet...

22:17.036 --> 22:18.936
Traces back...

22:18.938 --> 22:21.472
To la grenouille.

22:21.474 --> 22:22.573
Oh, no.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.876
No, no, no,
boss, we can't.

22:25.878 --> 22:29.847
I just promised Jeanne this had
nothing to do with her father.

22:29.849 --> 22:32.650
Well, looks like you were wrong.

22:41.094 --> 22:42.393
Looks like
you haven't touched

22:42.395 --> 22:43.728
your breakfast
burrito yet, Tony.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.062
Not hungry, Tim.

22:45.064 --> 22:46.464
I'm feeling a fever come on.

22:46.466 --> 22:47.698
Maybe I should go home.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.633
You'll be fine.

22:49.635 --> 22:50.735
I won't be fine.

22:50.737 --> 22:52.036
Nothing's gonna be fine.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.904
Any update on the Van?

22:53.906 --> 22:55.039
Still waiting on the DNA

22:55.041 --> 22:57.742
from the blood,
but we did confirm

22:57.744 --> 22:59.143
that la grenouille is connected.

22:59.145 --> 23:01.078
Fingerprints?

23:01.080 --> 23:02.913
Abby matched them
from his steering wheel

23:02.915 --> 23:04.048
to one of his former henchman.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.750
His name is Oskar bruenig,

23:05.752 --> 23:07.084
42 years old.

23:07.086 --> 23:10.087
Wait, that is, uh, not bruenig.

23:10.089 --> 23:12.390
Come on, stop messing around
and take that down.

23:12.392 --> 23:13.758
She's gonna be here
any second.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.393
Yeah, I know.

23:15.395 --> 23:17.428
I-i loaded bruenig's mug shot--

23:17.430 --> 23:18.796
(remote beeping)
Ah, hold on.

23:18.798 --> 23:20.765
I'll fix this.
Bishop: Right over here.

23:22.168 --> 23:24.402
Bishop:
Gibbs...

23:24.404 --> 23:25.870
This is Dr. David woods,
and I believe you know

23:25.872 --> 23:27.571
Dr. Jeanne benoit-woods.

23:27.573 --> 23:29.707
Whatever we can do
for you, agent Gibbs.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.075
Thank you.

23:32.412 --> 23:33.411
Actually I'd like
to talk your wife.

23:33.413 --> 23:35.012
What about?

23:35.014 --> 23:36.480
I got it up, boss.

23:39.118 --> 23:41.619
You lied to me,
you son of a bitch.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.654
Jeanne, we did not know then.

23:43.656 --> 23:46.157
You swore to me that it wasn't
about my father, but it was.

23:46.159 --> 23:47.825
Jeanne, don't
lose your cool...

23:47.826 --> 23:49.492
Let's all take
this upstairs, all right?

23:57.003 --> 23:58.869
Déjà vu.

24:00.706 --> 24:02.706
We made the connection
last night.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.143
Your father's
not a suspect.

24:06.145 --> 24:09.847
Obviously... you aren't, either.

24:09.849 --> 24:12.450
Then what am I doing here?

24:12.452 --> 24:14.885
Well, we're wondering
what you might know

24:14.887 --> 24:17.621
about one of his men.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.491
He's one of three men

24:20.493 --> 24:21.659
we believe stole weapons

24:21.661 --> 24:23.794
from a naval base,

24:23.796 --> 24:25.663
killed a young petty officer.

24:25.665 --> 24:27.064
Does he have a name?

24:27.066 --> 24:29.133
Oskar bruenig.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.501
He is a native of Austria,

24:30.503 --> 24:32.236
and wanted
in three countries.

24:32.238 --> 24:35.506
I know the face
and recall an accent.

24:35.508 --> 24:37.241
But his name
wasn't Oskar.

24:37.243 --> 24:39.009
He was my dad's driver.

24:39.011 --> 24:41.479
He's a lot more than that now.

24:41.481 --> 24:43.481
Bishop: What name did
you know him by?

24:43.483 --> 24:45.716
Oh, what was it?

24:45.718 --> 24:47.718
It was so long ago.
I was still in med school.

24:47.720 --> 24:50.154
Your dad was in
the business of selling weapons,

24:50.156 --> 24:52.890
guns, to bad guys.

24:52.892 --> 24:55.259
Yeah, I don't need you
to remind me.

24:55.261 --> 24:56.927
We do need you to think.

24:56.929 --> 24:59.763
This guy learned from your dad.

24:59.765 --> 25:01.198
And there are 300

25:01.200 --> 25:03.767
m-16's out there right now,
that are missing.

25:03.769 --> 25:06.504
You know who should
have an m-16?

25:06.506 --> 25:08.606
Soldiers.

25:12.545 --> 25:14.278
Pierre.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.813
That was it.

25:15.815 --> 25:17.581
I'm pretty sure my dad
called him Pierre.

25:19.986 --> 25:22.686
Look, David,

25:22.688 --> 25:24.688
I hope you know this
is almost as difficult

25:24.690 --> 25:27.157
for me as it is
for Jeanne.

25:29.529 --> 25:31.161
Key word there
being "almost."

25:31.163 --> 25:32.630
Fair enough.

25:32.632 --> 25:34.198
And I hope you know that

25:34.200 --> 25:37.167
while I am truly grateful,

25:37.169 --> 25:39.970
I'm not giving up Jeanne.

25:39.972 --> 25:42.206
Excuse me?

25:42.208 --> 25:44.742
I see the way you look at her.

25:46.546 --> 25:48.679
Frankly,

25:48.681 --> 25:51.081
the way that she looks at you

25:51.083 --> 25:53.684
would trouble me a bit
if I didn't know your history.

25:53.686 --> 25:55.886
So you know.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.588
I'm her husband.

25:57.590 --> 26:00.090
I know everything.

26:00.092 --> 26:01.926
Just like I know
when affairs end badly,

26:01.928 --> 26:04.929
like yours most certainly did,

26:04.931 --> 26:07.865
they have a way of
staying under the skin

26:07.867 --> 26:10.234
whether you want them to or not.

26:11.270 --> 26:13.237
She's not under my skin, David.

26:13.239 --> 26:16.574
It's not<i> your</i> skin
I'm worried about.

26:16.576 --> 26:18.309
(Door opens)

26:31.958 --> 26:34.658
Excuse me, Jeanne,
i just wanted to apologize

26:34.660 --> 26:36.060
if there was
any misunderstanding.

26:36.062 --> 26:37.761
Uh...

26:37.763 --> 26:39.263
Can you give us a minute?

26:39.265 --> 26:42.032
Sure.

26:43.636 --> 26:46.136
Um, what...

26:46.138 --> 26:48.072
Don't I understand, Tony?

26:48.074 --> 26:49.640
(Sighs)

26:49.642 --> 26:51.041
I just want to be really clear

26:51.043 --> 26:52.610
that when we came
to see you yesterday,

26:52.612 --> 26:54.678
it had nothing
to do with your father.

26:56.015 --> 26:58.349
Okay, then, so we're good now?

27:00.853 --> 27:02.286
Or will you one day
find another reason

27:02.288 --> 27:04.388
to stop by?

27:04.390 --> 27:05.923
And always
at the precise moment

27:05.925 --> 27:08.993
when I'm starting
to feel whole again.

27:08.995 --> 27:11.095
I just thought after Africa,
that we had put that--

27:11.097 --> 27:13.163
ride's here, Jeanne.

27:27.847 --> 27:30.180
Um, I'm still on call, Gibbs,

27:30.182 --> 27:32.383
but I got time to pitch in
if you need me.

27:32.385 --> 27:33.417
What's our next move?

27:33.419 --> 27:35.753
<i> Our</i> next move?

27:35.755 --> 27:39.123
I'm not finding any Pierre
bruenigs here, Gibbs. McGee?

27:39.125 --> 27:41.925
Uh, got a Pierre Oskar,
with a" k."

27:41.927 --> 27:43.193
Where?

27:43.195 --> 27:44.395
Last known address

27:44.397 --> 27:46.330
is Reston, Virginia.
Worth a try.

27:46.332 --> 27:48.015
Can I tag along?

27:48.016 --> 27:49.699
Nope. No more tagging.
Aw, Gibbs...

27:49.702 --> 27:51.702
No. You got your job,
we got our job.

27:51.704 --> 27:52.853
Go do your job.

27:52.854 --> 27:54.003
But my slate is wide open.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.172
I don't even have
to make rounds.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.306
Then go play hooky.

27:56.308 --> 27:58.175
Go spend time
with your wife.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.843
Take her out to lunch.

27:59.845 --> 28:01.979
Take her to the movies.
She deserves it...

28:01.981 --> 28:03.681
After putting up with you.

28:03.683 --> 28:06.150
Hmm, yeah,
you're right about that.

28:06.152 --> 28:09.353
I can't even remember
the last time I played hooky.

28:09.355 --> 28:10.854
Then go do it.

28:12.058 --> 28:14.224
Your dad wouldn't
be disappointed.

28:14.226 --> 28:15.859
Promise you.

28:15.861 --> 28:18.362
(Laughs)

28:20.700 --> 28:21.365
Federal agents!

28:21.367 --> 28:24.301
(Dogs barking in distance)

28:40.086 --> 28:41.785
This our guy?
That's him.

28:42.988 --> 28:45.322
Two in the chest.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.124
Agent: Atf!
NCIS!
NCIS!

28:49.395 --> 28:50.394
You guys again.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.129
"Again"?

28:52.131 --> 28:53.964
Yeah, we met him
at the hospital.

28:53.966 --> 28:55.399
Agent kitt, right?

28:55.401 --> 28:57.334
McGee and bishop?

28:57.336 --> 28:58.736
When did you guys

28:58.738 --> 29:00.070
figure out the
Oskar connection?

29:00.072 --> 29:02.272
Same time you did, apparently.

29:02.274 --> 29:04.174
And we're both too late.

29:04.176 --> 29:06.810
I thought we agreed
to share information.

29:06.812 --> 29:08.145
That's a two-way street.

29:08.147 --> 29:09.813
Doesn't matter now.

29:11.150 --> 29:12.516
Bishop: Detonators.

29:12.518 --> 29:16.153
I wonder what he was
planning to do with those?

29:16.155 --> 29:18.422
The whole theater
to ourselves.

29:18.424 --> 29:19.823
We probably could've
fooled around.

29:19.825 --> 29:21.258
(Laughs)

29:21.260 --> 29:23.293
Well, we'll consider this
a recon mission.

29:23.295 --> 29:25.763
Now we know matinees are,
shall we say "roomy,"

29:25.765 --> 29:27.765
uh, we can plan accordingly
for next time.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.366
Ooh, I like the
sound of that.

29:29.368 --> 29:30.801
What-- "roomy"?

29:30.803 --> 29:31.835
"Next time."

29:31.837 --> 29:32.970
(Phone ringing)
(Chuckles) Oh!

29:32.972 --> 29:34.972
So much for playing hooky.

29:34.974 --> 29:36.540
Oh... oh, I'm gonna
need a minute.

29:36.542 --> 29:38.041
Okay, give me the keys.

29:38.043 --> 29:40.043
I'm gonna start the car.
I'm a little chilly.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.780
Dr. taft.

29:42.782 --> 29:43.914
(Woman speaking indistinctly
over the phone)

29:43.916 --> 29:45.282
Uh, okay.
Let's just, uh, up his dose

29:45.284 --> 29:46.784
to 50 migs every hour.

29:46.786 --> 29:48.085
And what else we got?

29:48.087 --> 29:49.486
(Alarm chirps twice)

29:56.529 --> 29:57.995
(Engine stuttering)

29:57.997 --> 29:59.196
Oh, no.

29:59.198 --> 30:00.464
Come on.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.966
What is that?

30:02.968 --> 30:05.903
(Engine stuttering)
Come on, come on.

30:05.905 --> 30:07.004
(Sighs)

30:10.342 --> 30:12.476
Okay. Can you move
my 5:00 to 6:30?

30:12.478 --> 30:14.912
And that way
we can get him into...
Something's wrong with the car.

30:14.914 --> 30:17.147
Okay. I'm gonna have
to call you back.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.982
What?
I don't know.
It's making a sound.

30:18.984 --> 30:20.317
(Sighs)
I've never heard
this before.

30:20.319 --> 30:22.286
I just had it in the shop.
(Groans)

30:27.126 --> 30:29.426
(People screaming,
car alarm horn honking)

30:44.877 --> 30:46.043
(Elevator bell dings)

30:47.179 --> 30:48.178
Hey.

30:48.180 --> 30:51.114
You all right?
Um...

30:55.888 --> 30:57.238
Considering, you know.

30:57.239 --> 30:58.589
They might, uh, keep her
overnight.

30:58.591 --> 31:01.024
Ears ringing,
heart pounding.

31:01.026 --> 31:03.026
Like mine, actually.

31:03.028 --> 31:05.929
You know what happened?
Don't you?

31:05.931 --> 31:07.531
Cars don't just explode.

31:07.533 --> 31:09.266
I let their friend die
on that table.

31:09.268 --> 31:11.301
That is obvious revenge.

31:11.303 --> 31:13.604
Come on. Sit down.

31:13.606 --> 31:15.038
Sit down.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.107
It's gonna be okay.
Just sit down.

31:17.109 --> 31:18.542
No, it's not okay.

31:18.544 --> 31:20.577
Who the hell am i
to be playing a cop?

31:20.579 --> 31:23.614
(Sighs) I have enough trouble
just being a doctor.

31:23.616 --> 31:26.049
Oh, no, disagree
with you there, doc.

31:27.453 --> 31:29.253
All sizzle, no steak.

31:29.255 --> 31:31.989
Consumed with my own... healing,

31:31.991 --> 31:34.591
I've been completely ignoring
the-the one person,

31:34.593 --> 31:37.527
the most important person.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.565
The only one I have left.

31:41.567 --> 31:44.001
You still got her.

31:44.003 --> 31:46.637
You still got each other.

31:47.640 --> 31:50.540
Which is why I'm leaving.

31:52.645 --> 31:54.511
We've been promising
each other, for years,

31:54.513 --> 31:57.514
that we were gonna take
a long trip someday.

31:57.516 --> 32:01.551
If not around the world,
then close to it.

32:02.521 --> 32:04.688
Someday.

32:04.690 --> 32:06.523
Mm.

32:06.525 --> 32:08.558
Dumb excuses, you know?

32:08.560 --> 32:11.328
Uh, Paul was too little.

32:11.330 --> 32:13.697
We were too busy.
(Chuckles)

32:13.699 --> 32:16.700
We were gonna wait
till Paul grew up

32:16.702 --> 32:20.370
and could be on his own.

32:20.372 --> 32:22.572
"If the world were perfect,

32:22.574 --> 32:25.108
it wouldn't be."

32:26.078 --> 32:29.079
Uh, is that...

32:29.081 --> 32:32.182
Did you just quote yogi berra?

32:32.184 --> 32:33.617
(Chuckles)

32:33.619 --> 32:35.652
Yeah, my dad, he was,
he was a big yogi fan.

32:35.654 --> 32:37.654
(Chuckles) Big.

32:37.656 --> 32:39.089
(Chuckles)

32:39.091 --> 32:41.491
Used to always tell me
that as a kid.

32:41.493 --> 32:44.194
Whenever I got down.

32:44.196 --> 32:47.631
"If the world were perfect,

32:47.633 --> 32:49.666
it wouldn't be."

32:49.668 --> 32:51.501
Yeah.

32:51.503 --> 32:54.371
Take that trip, doc.

32:54.373 --> 32:56.239
Soon.

32:56.241 --> 33:00.644
(Phone ringing)

33:00.646 --> 33:02.279
I'll check in on you.

33:02.281 --> 33:03.347
(Phone beeps on)

33:04.650 --> 33:06.350
Yeah, McGee, on my way.

33:11.223 --> 33:12.389
<i> (Elevator bell chimes)</i>

33:12.391 --> 33:13.623
Bishop:
This is a big deal.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.192
Tony: I'm deeply touched
by your concern, bishop,

33:15.194 --> 33:16.626
but, seriously, I'm fine.

33:16.628 --> 33:18.028
Well, I want to
believe you, Tony,

33:18.030 --> 33:20.364
except that I would
so not be fine.

33:20.366 --> 33:21.465
Yeah, I will double that.

33:21.467 --> 33:23.200
Jeanne, David, all those looks.

33:23.202 --> 33:24.468
I would say that "awkward"

33:24.470 --> 33:25.702
doesn't even begin
to describe that.

33:25.704 --> 33:27.855
Mm-hmm.

33:27.856 --> 33:30.007
Okay, "super-awkward" then,
which I admit it was.

33:30.009 --> 33:32.009
But now that the case
is basically over,

33:32.011 --> 33:33.677
maybe we can just move on?

33:33.679 --> 33:36.246
Gibbs: What do you mean,
it's over?

33:36.248 --> 33:38.548
Gibbs, how are they?
Taft and his wife,
what happened?

33:38.550 --> 33:40.717
They're all right. What's over?

33:40.719 --> 33:43.320
Well, after you, uh,
left for the hospital,

33:43.322 --> 33:45.756
we got a call
from atf agent kitt.

33:45.758 --> 33:47.491
Shared some
information with us.

33:47.493 --> 33:48.625
What information?

33:48.627 --> 33:50.260
They found the guns.

33:50.262 --> 33:52.662
Um, unfortunately,
too late again.

33:52.664 --> 33:54.664
They were already on
a plane to the Ukraine

33:54.666 --> 33:56.266
to be sold in their
black market.

33:56.268 --> 33:57.701
What about the third shooter?

33:57.703 --> 33:59.636
They're assuming
he's on the same plane.

33:59.638 --> 34:01.471
That's the "basically"
part, boss.

34:01.473 --> 34:04.441
Atf found the guns, but we're
not giving up on the shooter.

34:04.443 --> 34:06.276
Kitt said they'd
take it from here,

34:06.278 --> 34:08.345
but, uh, they'd
keep us in the loop.

34:08.347 --> 34:11.048
Oh, I want to hear
that in person.

34:15.120 --> 34:17.721
Have a seat.

34:17.723 --> 34:19.322
(Chuckles quietly)

34:19.324 --> 34:21.425
Is this a joke?

34:21.427 --> 34:23.827
I show you the
professional courtesy

34:23.829 --> 34:25.829
of dragging my ass
down here late at night

34:25.831 --> 34:27.764
for an interrogation room?

34:33.806 --> 34:35.072
Tell me what's going on.

34:36.809 --> 34:38.408
What do you mean?
I told your agents.

34:38.410 --> 34:39.843
Didn't they tell you?
Yeah.

34:39.845 --> 34:41.678
Got me to wondering.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.680
You show up at the hospital
just before us,

34:43.682 --> 34:46.450
at Oscar's place just after us.

34:46.452 --> 34:49.686
What is it you're afraid
we might find?

34:49.688 --> 34:51.688
Find?

34:51.690 --> 34:53.223
What else is there to find?

34:53.225 --> 34:56.126
I've crossed paths
with atf before,

34:56.128 --> 34:58.795
tracking stolen weapons
to see where they landed.

34:58.797 --> 35:02.799
Atf told us
it was not our concern,

35:02.801 --> 35:04.367
and it didn't end well, so...

35:04.369 --> 35:06.236
That's the game
you're playing,

35:06.238 --> 35:09.739
tell me now, amigo.

35:09.741 --> 35:12.109
Don't waste my time.

35:14.613 --> 35:16.680
It's a top-secret op.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.884
Military weapons have been
disappearing for years,

35:20.886 --> 35:23.820
so we installed
these tracking chips.

35:23.822 --> 35:26.857
Not anticipating
this robbery but...

35:26.859 --> 35:28.425
When it happened,
it seemed like a...

35:28.427 --> 35:30.861
Good opportunity
to test our system.

35:30.863 --> 35:33.897
So you've been tracking 'em
from the start.

35:33.899 --> 35:35.365
Technically.

35:35.367 --> 35:38.802
Uh, rather than scoop
the guns up,

35:38.804 --> 35:40.470
we've been waiting
to see where they went.

35:40.472 --> 35:43.140
These guys killed
a petty officer

35:43.142 --> 35:45.142
and they tried to
kill my friend.

35:45.144 --> 35:47.844
Tough call, I know.

35:49.648 --> 35:52.649
So there is no plane
to the Ukraine?

35:52.651 --> 35:53.850
No.

35:53.852 --> 35:56.153
No, the guns and ammo
have been divvied up

35:56.155 --> 35:59.523
and sent off in multiple
directions, right here at home.

35:59.525 --> 36:02.859
Who is our third shooter?

36:02.861 --> 36:04.327
I don't know.

36:06.732 --> 36:10.433
But I might be able to track
down which gun he's got.

36:20.646 --> 36:22.946
(Tire blows out)

36:25.817 --> 36:27.317
(Seat belt clicks open)

36:54.780 --> 36:56.580
McGee:
Dare you to pick that up...

36:58.383 --> 36:59.449
...missy.

37:07.859 --> 37:08.858
(Two knocks on door)

37:08.860 --> 37:10.527
(Door opens)

37:10.529 --> 37:12.963
Last visit, I promise.

37:12.965 --> 37:15.232
What do you want, Tony?

37:15.234 --> 37:18.301
Well...

37:18.303 --> 37:20.337
Is David here?

37:20.339 --> 37:22.706
He went home. We...

37:23.709 --> 37:25.809
He went home.

37:25.811 --> 37:28.812
Well, I just wanted
to tell the both of you

37:28.814 --> 37:31.014
that the case is closed.

37:31.016 --> 37:33.650
We caught the bad guys,
guns have been found, sort of,

37:33.652 --> 37:34.684
and, uh,
we won't need to bother

37:34.686 --> 37:36.886
your doctor friends
in Africa.

37:36.888 --> 37:38.888
Good to know.

37:38.890 --> 37:40.790
Thank you.

37:40.792 --> 37:41.791
My pleasure.

37:41.793 --> 37:43.460
I mean... not...

37:43.462 --> 37:44.894
Whatever.

37:44.896 --> 37:47.797
I had a crazy night.

37:49.935 --> 37:52.969
You always work
this late?

37:52.971 --> 37:55.605
David and I got
in a fight, Tony.

37:55.607 --> 37:58.008
All this talk about
you and me and my dad

37:58.010 --> 38:00.977
led to an actual fight,
which never happens.

38:00.979 --> 38:03.046
Rarely.

38:05.017 --> 38:06.616
Sorry to hear that.

38:07.853 --> 38:12.289
But, again, I...

38:12.291 --> 38:13.923
I had no intention
of coming back here.

38:13.925 --> 38:15.859
It was just the case,
and McGee said...

38:15.861 --> 38:17.761
Whatever.
It can't happen again.

38:17.763 --> 38:18.962
I know.

38:18.964 --> 38:20.664
Trust me.

38:25.003 --> 38:27.304
What you said yesterday,

38:27.306 --> 38:30.473
about me dropping in

38:30.475 --> 38:33.476
just when you...

38:33.478 --> 38:36.012
Start feeling whole again.

38:36.014 --> 38:39.849
And what about it?

38:39.851 --> 38:42.852
I know that feeling.

38:42.854 --> 38:45.322
The not feeling whole part.

38:47.025 --> 38:49.092
Do you?

38:51.730 --> 38:55.932
And if I had
one wish, Jeanne...

38:55.934 --> 38:58.968
What?

38:58.970 --> 39:02.105
...i would
turn back the clock,

39:02.107 --> 39:06.109
to right when we got back
from south Sudan.

39:06.111 --> 39:08.111
(Wry laugh)

39:08.113 --> 39:12.615
Because I think that was a much
better ending for both of us.

39:15.554 --> 39:17.554
(Quiet laugh)

39:17.556 --> 39:19.622
What?

39:22.094 --> 39:25.362
I guess I would go back further.

39:27.632 --> 39:29.132
Good night, Tony.

39:32.104 --> 39:34.371
Good night.

39:38.844 --> 39:42.145
Good-bye, Tony.

39:46.451 --> 39:48.518
Bye.

39:53.392 --> 39:54.591
(Door opens)

39:56.762 --> 39:58.895
(Door closes)

40:05.971 --> 40:07.871
How low can we go?

40:09.441 --> 40:11.941
You talking to me?

40:11.943 --> 40:13.510
Stood up at a diner.

40:13.512 --> 40:16.546
Makes us both pretty sad
cases, I'm just saying.

40:16.548 --> 40:18.681
Nah, I'm not sad.
Or stood up.

40:18.683 --> 40:20.817
Yeah, right.

40:20.819 --> 40:22.485
I got a friend coming.

40:22.487 --> 40:24.454
Doesn't everybody?

40:24.456 --> 40:28.158
I need a ten-letter word
for "polished metal."

40:30.695 --> 40:31.694
Good luck with that.

40:31.696 --> 40:34.164
Not big on crosswords?

40:34.166 --> 40:37.867
No, no, I'm not... big.

40:37.869 --> 40:38.902
I'm not...

40:38.904 --> 40:41.538
Too busy.
Not being stood up.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.173
All right, what
about platinum?

40:43.175 --> 40:45.108
P-l-a-t-i...

40:45.110 --> 40:46.543
(Mouthing letters)

40:46.545 --> 40:48.912
It's only eight letters.

40:48.914 --> 40:50.213
Try "brightwork."

40:50.215 --> 40:51.648
Brightwork?

40:51.650 --> 40:53.716
For polished metal?

40:53.718 --> 40:55.718
Well, yeah,
it can be that, or-or

40:55.720 --> 40:58.054
varnished wood
on a boat or ship.

40:58.056 --> 41:00.790
B-r-i-g-h-t...
I can spell.

41:02.093 --> 41:03.726
Hey, it fits!

41:03.728 --> 41:06.129
Smarter than you look.

41:06.131 --> 41:08.498
I have never been accused
of looking smart.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.099
Too pretty.

41:10.101 --> 41:11.634
But smart enough about boats.

41:11.636 --> 41:13.169
You a sailor?

41:15.207 --> 41:16.539
Okay.

41:16.541 --> 41:18.141
Give me another one.

41:18.143 --> 41:20.577
Rather not quit
while you're ahead?

41:20.579 --> 41:22.745
I'll roll the dice.

41:22.747 --> 41:24.981
I'm sure you've
rolled your share.

41:24.983 --> 41:28.017
Seven-letter word.
Rejuvenation.

41:28.019 --> 41:29.686
Rejuvenation?

41:29.688 --> 41:31.855
There an echo in here?

41:31.857 --> 41:33.256
Any letters?

41:33.258 --> 41:35.191
Um, ends with an "l."

41:35.193 --> 41:36.693
No first letter?

41:36.695 --> 41:38.595
If I had a first letter
here, popeye,

41:38.597 --> 41:40.230
I wouldn't need you.

41:41.199 --> 41:43.132
Renewal.

41:43.134 --> 41:45.702
What now?

41:45.704 --> 41:47.504
Ends with an "l." Renewal.

41:47.506 --> 41:49.572
(Chuckles)
Seven letters.

41:49.574 --> 41:51.174
Damn. Not bad.

41:51.176 --> 41:54.277
Not bad at all.

42:00.085 --> 42:03.686
You ready for
another, popeye?

42:06.258 --> 42:09.092
It's, uh... it's Gibbs.

42:09.094 --> 42:12.128
But I think you know that.

42:12.130 --> 42:14.197
Don't you, grace?

42:14.199 --> 42:17.534
That's Dr. confalone to you.

42:17.536 --> 42:19.602
You ready?

42:23.108 --> 42:24.841
Ready.
