00:01.369 --> 00:04.004
male announcer: Next is
a Bravo original comedy.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.076
- Ugh, can you believe that

00:08.109 --> 00:10.144
there's another Jewish holiday
next week

00:10.178 --> 00:12.580
and school is closed again.
- Another one?

00:12.613 --> 00:14.248
- Yeah.
- Ugh, when will it end?

00:14.282 --> 00:16.650
- Sorry, it's all
part of our conspiracy

00:16.684 --> 00:17.985
to take over the world.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.353
[chuckles]

00:19.387 --> 00:21.322
- Anyway, I was thinking
of organizing

00:21.355 --> 00:22.823
a guided tour of the Met

00:22.856 --> 00:24.525
with an art historian
for the kids that day.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.194
- Oh, count us in.

00:26.227 --> 00:27.895
That night we have
a Navy Seal coming

00:27.928 --> 00:30.831
to meet with the family
about disaster preparedness.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.067
- Oh, we did that last year.
We have six Go Bags

00:33.101 --> 00:34.602
from BlackUmbrella.com.

00:34.635 --> 00:37.105
and enough food and water
in our safe room for a year.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.839
- Wait, what?
Are you guys serious?

00:38.872 --> 00:41.942
- Jill, wake up
and smell the Zika virus.

00:41.975 --> 00:43.244
Anything can happen.

00:43.277 --> 00:45.413
Extreme weather, ISIS attacks,

00:45.446 --> 00:47.681
zombie apocalypse.
- You have to have a plan.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.583
We have a $16,000...
[cell phone beeping]

00:49.617 --> 00:51.552
Inflatable family life raft
that we can board

00:51.585 --> 00:53.587
right on the river
next to Brearly.

00:53.621 --> 00:55.523
- Huh.
Weird.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.691
- Jill,
what could be more important

00:57.725 --> 00:59.293
than preparing
for the end of the world?

00:59.327 --> 01:00.794
- Sorry, nothing.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.763
Just breaking news buzz

01:02.796 --> 01:05.599
that kale's been declassified
as a superfood.

01:05.633 --> 01:08.169
- What?
- Kale?

01:08.202 --> 01:09.537
- What?
- Is this a joke?

01:09.570 --> 01:11.139
- That can't be.
- No, no.

01:11.139 --> 01:13.141
- I was just beginning
to enjoy it.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.875
- There's folic acid...
- I'll call my lawyer.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.810
- There's tons of minerals...

01:16.844 --> 01:18.146
- Someone has got
to do something about this.

01:18.146 --> 01:19.813
- No...
- I have to...

01:19.847 --> 01:22.283
- I won't believe it.
- Shit!

01:22.316 --> 01:23.451
[all panicking]

01:23.484 --> 01:25.686
- [exhales]
Is there vodka here?

01:25.719 --> 01:28.389
- * Hey, yes, you know

01:28.422 --> 01:31.992
* I'm feeling fine,
I'm feeling fine *

01:34.328 --> 01:35.963
- It was the best risotto
we've had on the show.

01:35.996 --> 01:37.498
- It was those tomatoes.
They were delicious

01:37.531 --> 01:40.334
on the plate.
- Guys, please turn off the TV.

01:40.368 --> 01:43.204
- They were so sweet.
- I've been awake 20 minutes

01:43.237 --> 01:45.973
and I'm already hungry.
Longest day of the year.

01:46.006 --> 01:48.576
- You know,
you don't have to fast.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.245
- My parents are here
and we always fast on Yom Kips.

01:51.279 --> 01:53.414
I've been doing it
since I had feathered bangs

01:53.447 --> 01:55.015
at my Bat Mitzvah.

01:55.048 --> 01:56.817
This is the holiest day
of the year.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.919
Turn that goddamn thing off.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.921
- Hey.
- Turn it back on.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.256
- Absolutely not.

02:02.290 --> 02:04.425
Today is about reflection

02:04.458 --> 02:06.494
and apology and bad breath.

02:06.527 --> 02:09.230
It's, like, National Halitosis
day for the Jews.

02:09.263 --> 02:11.765
- Yeah, why does fasting
make your breath so bad?

02:11.799 --> 02:13.267
- Only Adonai knows,

02:13.301 --> 02:15.836
but if you want Christmas,
you are doing Yom Kippur.

02:15.869 --> 02:18.105
- Ugh.
Oh, God...

02:18.206 --> 02:20.007
- Jill, I am begging you
to have a sip of coffee.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.475
- [sniffs]
- It'll be better for everybody.

02:21.509 --> 02:24.278
- [exhales]
Miles, you are not wearing Crocs

02:24.312 --> 02:25.813
to synagogue.
- Yes, I am.

02:25.846 --> 02:28.916
- No, you're not.
- I hate you!

02:28.949 --> 02:32.085
- I can't fight this battle.
I'm too weak today.

02:32.119 --> 02:35.989
- Listen, even though
I am technically Episcopalian,

02:36.023 --> 02:39.293
I am going to fast with you
this year in solidarity.

02:39.327 --> 02:42.296
- That is so nice.

02:42.330 --> 02:44.498
- What're we atoning for again?

02:44.532 --> 02:45.999
- Bad shit we did.

02:46.033 --> 02:49.002
[Jewish music]

02:49.036 --> 02:50.971
- And we say together...

02:51.004 --> 02:52.240
all: Amen.

02:52.240 --> 02:55.243
- [singing in Hebrew]

02:56.910 --> 02:59.280
- Is that Toby Schmidt
in the tweed?

02:59.313 --> 03:00.781
Oh, she looks wonderful.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.883
- No, Mom, that's Iris Shimmel.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.252
- Really?

03:04.285 --> 03:05.553
Oh, she looks terrible.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.521
- On Rosh Hashanah we reflect.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.690
On Yom Kippur we consider.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.892
Who shall live
for the sake others?

03:11.925 --> 03:15.128
Who dying shall leave
a heritage of life?

03:15.162 --> 03:18.266
- Oh, that reminds me.

03:18.299 --> 03:21.402
Andy, do me a favor.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.136
Take a look at this afterwards,
all right?

03:23.170 --> 03:24.372
We updated our wills.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.139
- Oh, good, you didn't forget.

03:26.173 --> 03:27.541
- You're doing this here?

03:27.575 --> 03:29.577
- Yeah, we decided
that you're gonna be

03:29.610 --> 03:32.613
our "Do Not Resuscitate" person
if you're up for it.

03:32.646 --> 03:33.981
- It'd be an honor, Alan.

03:34.014 --> 03:35.716
- Okay.
- Wait, what?

03:35.749 --> 03:38.319
You mean your plug-puller
if you're on life support?

03:38.352 --> 03:41.154
- Yeah, we realized
we can't be each others.

03:41.188 --> 03:42.756
Too emotional.
- Mm-hmm.

03:42.790 --> 03:45.993
- We rise on page 354.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.897
- And why did Andy get the job?
Why not me?

03:49.930 --> 03:53.301
- Honey, Andy is an attorney,
okay?

03:53.301 --> 03:54.735
And he's very level-headed.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.003
- Yeah, but I'm your daughter.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.170
If anyone gets to kill you,

03:57.204 --> 04:00.341
it should be me.
- Shh!

04:00.374 --> 04:01.675
Oh, hi, Jill.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.043
Sorry, I didn't realize
it was you.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.078
[speaking Hebrew]
all: Amen.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.914
- Please be seated.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.718
- What're you doing here?

04:10.751 --> 04:13.186
- It's the holiest day
of the Jewish Calendar.

04:13.220 --> 04:15.423
A time of reflection
and redemption.

04:15.456 --> 04:17.224
- Yeah, I know.
I'm Jewish.

04:17.325 --> 04:19.026
- And now I am too.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.094
I told Jared if we made it
to ten years, I'd convert.

04:21.128 --> 04:22.930
He's in Singapore right now.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.899
Anyway, Brooke was nice enough
to give me the day off, so...

04:25.933 --> 04:28.536
- Day off
from telling her she's not fat?

04:28.569 --> 04:31.905
- No, silly.
I'm the "Dreamer in Chief"

04:31.939 --> 04:34.074
of her new fashion house,
von Weber.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.943
It's going to be huge.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.011
- Right, right, right.
I keep forgetting.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.680
Anyway, Mazel.

04:39.713 --> 04:43.684
- Please rise as we
return the Torah to the ark.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.687
[all singing in Hebrew]

04:46.720 --> 04:49.723
- [Stephanie singing loudly
in Hebrew]

04:54.795 --> 04:57.598
- The campaign needs
to ooze decadence.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.232
It's about saying yes,

04:59.266 --> 05:02.102
not thinking twice,
no regrets.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.472
- Amazing, love that.
[dog whimpers]

05:04.505 --> 05:07.107
And you love that too,
don't you?

05:07.140 --> 05:10.043
Who's a good therapy dog?
Whose helping me think

05:10.077 --> 05:12.112
about the needs of others?
[door opens]

05:12.145 --> 05:13.947
- Sorry to interrupt.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.683
I just talked to the broker

05:15.716 --> 05:18.452
and the space on Madison
and 73rd is actually

05:18.486 --> 05:20.688
575 per square foot,

05:20.721 --> 05:23.391
which means we need
an additional 500K

05:23.424 --> 05:24.792
or we're back
to the drawing board.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.960
- No, I want that location.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.962
I'll call Howie.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.398
Damn it.

05:30.398 --> 05:33.000
My entire legal
and accounting departments are

05:33.033 --> 05:35.235
out for Yom Kippur.
So annoying.

05:35.268 --> 05:37.671
I'm gonna have to talk directly
to the investors.

05:37.705 --> 05:38.972
Can you give me the room,
ladies?

05:39.006 --> 05:40.073
This isn't gonna be pretty.

05:40.107 --> 05:41.742
- You shake those money trees.

05:41.775 --> 05:44.211
- I will, girl.

05:46.414 --> 05:48.516
I think J'neece is
working out well, don't you?

05:48.549 --> 05:49.917
- She's a dream.

05:49.950 --> 05:53.220
- She reminds me of someone else
who had a dream.

05:53.253 --> 05:56.223
[rock music]

05:56.256 --> 06:00.494
*

06:00.528 --> 06:03.431
[cell phone buzzing]

06:04.432 --> 06:05.899
- [exhales]

06:05.933 --> 06:08.469
You know, I was meditating
this morning,

06:08.502 --> 06:10.571
and I visualized this call.

06:10.604 --> 06:13.173
It's time.
- I'm calling on business, Lex.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.975
- Oh, right.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.745
Yeah, I'm all ears.
Fire away.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.913
- For reasons
I'd rather not go into,

06:19.947 --> 06:22.750
it turns out we're going
to need another 500K

06:22.783 --> 06:23.951
for the retail store.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.953
- On top of what
I already fronted?

06:25.986 --> 06:28.956
I--I'm gonna have to run that up
the flagpole, babe.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.692
- You are the flagpole,
and don't call me "babe."

06:31.725 --> 06:34.528
If you can't do it, I'll find
another investor who can.

06:34.562 --> 06:37.765
- Wait, I hear you,

06:37.798 --> 06:40.968
and I honor your integrity.
Consider it done.

06:41.001 --> 06:44.271
I'm just gonna have to run that
by Pete and let Ernie know.

06:44.304 --> 06:48.241
So you going to that break-fast
later at Jillie's?

06:49.342 --> 06:50.511
Brooke?

06:50.544 --> 06:52.312

06:54.648 --> 06:57.217
- [singing in Hebrew]

06:57.250 --> 06:59.352
- Starv-acious.

06:59.386 --> 07:05.859
*

07:05.893 --> 07:07.094
- [quietly]
Oh, oh.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.908
- You both have living wills,
right?

07:20.941 --> 07:23.811
- Uh, why do I not remember
doing that?

07:23.844 --> 07:26.914
- Because we didn't.
We just have regular wills.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.516
- You're walking around
without living wills?

07:28.516 --> 07:30.383
- Yeah, I mean,
an air conditioner could

07:30.417 --> 07:32.786
fall on you on your way home
and you'd be on life support.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.054
- Okay, we'll deal with it.

07:34.087 --> 07:36.323
- Please turn to page 469

07:36.356 --> 07:38.592
to continue silent worship.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.763
- I assume we'll be each others
plug-pullers, right?

07:42.796 --> 07:44.532
- Uh, yeah, sure, I guess so.

07:44.532 --> 07:46.333
- Shh!
- Sorry.

07:46.366 --> 07:47.535
- Sorry.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.408
[cell phone rings]
- Oh, my God,

07:55.442 --> 07:57.978
never been so happy
to hear your voice.

07:58.011 --> 08:01.381
I am so crabby
and my breath is so bad,

08:01.414 --> 08:03.551
you could bottle it,
ship it to Syria,

08:03.584 --> 08:05.352
and we'd win the war on terror.

08:05.385 --> 08:07.054
- Oh, that's appetizing.
- [sighs]

08:07.087 --> 08:08.822
Hey, I need to do a living will.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.824
What do you think of Andy
as my plug-puller?

08:10.858 --> 08:12.860
- Mm, I think
you could do better.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.662
- Seriously?
- You need a hardass.

08:14.695 --> 08:17.330
Andy's too nice.
- Okay, glad I asked.

08:17.364 --> 08:19.099
So what's going on
in the normal world,

08:19.132 --> 08:21.334
aside from lots of eating.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.170
I can hear you chewing,
by the way.

08:23.203 --> 08:26.406
- Sorry.
Well, here's something:

08:26.439 --> 08:28.375
Elliot came over last night,
we hung out,

08:28.408 --> 08:29.843
had better than average sex,

08:29.877 --> 08:32.112
but this morning we woke
and I'm...

08:32.145 --> 08:33.246
how do I say this?

08:33.280 --> 08:34.748
Repulsed.
- Why?

08:34.782 --> 08:36.617
Did he have, like, mouth crust
or something?

08:36.650 --> 08:39.587
- No, it's more like
he woke up hideous.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.855
Is that possible?
- If I had to guess,

08:41.889 --> 08:44.191
I would say that you're
realizing that you hate him

08:44.224 --> 08:46.226
or that you're
falling in love with him,

08:46.259 --> 08:47.595
and it's freaking you out.

08:47.595 --> 08:49.362
- Um, no,

08:49.396 --> 08:51.865
and no.
- Okay, is it something fixable?

08:51.899 --> 08:54.034
Like the butt-cut.
- What butt-cut?

08:54.067 --> 08:57.605
- Oh, you know, his middle part.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.072
- [silently]
Ew...

08:59.106 --> 09:01.341
[normal voice]
Um, okay, anyhow,

09:01.374 --> 09:02.676
I'll let you get back
to atoning.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.477
What can we bring tonight?

09:04.511 --> 09:06.614
- Oh--
- Oh, shit, here comes my mom.

09:06.647 --> 09:09.617
- Hi, Vanessa.
Get off the phone, Jill.

09:09.617 --> 09:11.384
- I gotta go.
I'll call you later.

09:11.418 --> 09:13.053
[rock music]

09:13.086 --> 09:15.222
She called me.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.725
I'm just a little hurt you
didn't even consider me

09:17.758 --> 09:20.127
to be your plug-puller.
Feels a little sexist.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.829
- Oh, honey,
it isn't that we thought

09:21.862 --> 09:23.030
you wouldn't be good at it.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.865
We know you can be a
cold-hearted bitch

09:24.898 --> 09:26.634
when you need to be.
- Really?

09:26.667 --> 09:28.401
You're not just saying that
to make me feel better?

09:28.435 --> 09:29.870
- Oh, of course not, darling.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.639
I just think that you're
oversensitive

09:31.639 --> 09:33.073
because you're fasting.

09:33.106 --> 09:36.209
- Well, you're fasting too.
We all are.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.377
Aren't we?

09:37.410 --> 09:39.680
- Yeah, I'm fasting.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.481
I just had a mouthful
of cottage cheese

09:41.514 --> 09:43.183
with my blood pressure pills
and Daddy has to have his toast,

09:43.216 --> 09:45.853
you know,
his peanut butter toast,

09:45.886 --> 09:47.220
or he gets so grumpy.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.889
- So you're not fasting.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.158
I feel totally
and utterly betrayed.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.560
- Oh, come on.
It was two bites, Meryl Streep.

09:53.661 --> 09:54.995
Let's get back.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.529
- One, two, three, four.

09:56.563 --> 10:01.702
*

10:03.203 --> 10:05.572
- [groans]
Can't speak...

10:05.605 --> 10:07.675
- Three minutes to sundown.
- Too hungry.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.010
- Beautiful.
- I gotta say,

10:10.043 --> 10:11.945
this was not as bad as
I thought it was gonna be.

10:11.979 --> 10:14.381
I feel like I could fast
for a few more days now.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.083
I feel great.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.751
- Jill, dear,
last time I was here

10:17.785 --> 10:20.087
I brought a wonderful bottle
of Russian vodka...

10:20.120 --> 10:22.455
- This fish looks great, honey.
- Can we start of what?

10:22.489 --> 10:23.456
[dramatic music]

10:23.490 --> 10:26.026
- Wah...
- Wah, wah, wah.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.560
*

10:27.594 --> 10:32.132
all: Wah, wah, wah...

10:32.165 --> 10:40.140
*

10:40.173 --> 10:43.643
[sexy music]
- * Baby

10:43.677 --> 10:46.413
- Her appetite
never ceases to amaze me.

10:49.616 --> 10:49.983
[lilting music]

10:51.819 --> 10:53.020
- Jill.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.588
Mm, my sister.
- [chuckles]

10:55.622 --> 10:57.925
- My friend.
- Hi, Lex.

10:57.958 --> 11:00.728
Sorry I smell like
a fish who ate an onion,

11:00.728 --> 11:02.329
and it's only gonna get worse.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.531
- Do you know when Brooke is
getting here?

11:04.564 --> 11:06.299
- Brooke's coming?

11:06.333 --> 11:08.201
- I hope so.

11:08.235 --> 11:10.603
- Excuse me one second.
- [laughs]

11:10.637 --> 11:12.973
Yes, yes,
I'm constantly being told

11:13.006 --> 11:14.808
that I look decades younger
than I am.

11:14.842 --> 11:17.310
In fact, last week
I was carded at Cipriani.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.846
- [chuckles]
- Is that so?

11:18.879 --> 11:21.281
- But there is one thing
I'm wondering about.

11:21.314 --> 11:24.184
Alan, see this freckle here?

11:24.217 --> 11:26.153
Does this look
questionable to you?

11:26.186 --> 11:28.055
- I'll have a look here.

11:28.088 --> 11:32.159
Um, looks, uh--looks fine to me.

11:32.192 --> 11:36.229
- You realize Alan was
an orthopedic surgeon.

11:36.263 --> 11:39.299
You know, I--yeah, I better see
if Jill needs help.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.501
- If you're,
uh, concerned about it,

11:41.534 --> 11:43.771
I have a good friend
who's a dermatologist.

11:43.771 --> 11:45.906
Park Avenue doctor.
Very good.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.240
- How old is he?

11:47.274 --> 11:49.576
- [whispers]
She's seducing your father?

11:49.609 --> 11:52.012
- She belongs
in a Burberry straightjacket.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.781
- Oh, she's just needy.

11:53.781 --> 11:55.682
- Ugh, I hate that
they come here every year.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.150
Why would you celebrate
Yom Kippur

11:57.184 --> 11:58.418
if you didn't have to?

11:58.451 --> 12:00.420
It's the brown crayon
of holidays.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.389
- Hey, by the way,
have you taken Hazel

12:02.422 --> 12:04.391
to the orthodontist yet?
It's time.

12:04.424 --> 12:05.793
- No, Mom, I've been busy.

12:05.793 --> 12:08.395
- I really regret
not getting you braces.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.830
It's not too late, though,
you know.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.965
Everyone at the club is
doing Invisalign.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.801
- Okay, thank you, Mom.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.804
[rock music]

12:16.837 --> 12:18.505
*

12:18.538 --> 12:21.274
- Is there a special wine
for breaking the fast?

12:21.308 --> 12:24.011
- Don't ask me.
I'm a lapsed Catholic.

12:24.044 --> 12:27.514
- Ooh, this is
one of my favorites.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.917
[sexy music]

12:29.950 --> 12:31.418
- That looks good.

12:31.451 --> 12:34.822
- But this might go better
with a fish.

12:34.822 --> 12:36.289
[dramatic music]

12:36.323 --> 12:40.193
It's okay.
We can get the red or both.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.962
[sexy music]

12:41.995 --> 12:44.965
Unless you want to see
if they have a Lambrusco.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.433
*

12:46.466 --> 12:47.600
Or not.

12:47.634 --> 12:50.103
I thought you liked Lambrusco.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.872
- I go back and forth.

12:52.906 --> 12:54.507
- Sign next to the blue tabs.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.343
There and there.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.545
- I do this for a living, Alan,
but thanks.

12:58.578 --> 13:01.681
- You've been out of work,
so, uh--so maybe a little rusty.

13:01.714 --> 13:04.517
Jill, how about I ask Harvey

13:04.551 --> 13:07.287
to draw up a couple of living
wills for both of you, okay?

13:07.320 --> 13:08.856
It's pretty standard practice,

13:08.889 --> 13:10.357
uh, since you're signing
for each other.

13:10.390 --> 13:11.892
- Yeah, um...
[clears throat]

13:11.925 --> 13:13.861
We just need
to talk about it first.

13:13.861 --> 13:15.095
- What's to talk about?
We're married.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.296
That's what marriage is
all about.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.865
- Well, I'm just afraid

13:17.865 --> 13:19.900
that you might be
too upset to pull the plug

13:19.933 --> 13:21.768
if things got really ugly.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.603
- You underestimate me.
I can do it.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.905
No question.

13:24.938 --> 13:27.374
- Let's say there is
a car accident

13:27.407 --> 13:31.244
on the Cross Bronx Expressway,

13:31.278 --> 13:35.082
and your wife is
catapulted head-first

13:35.115 --> 13:36.984
through the windshield.
- Oh, my God, Alan.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.952
- This is very important
to talk about.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.620
I mean, Jill can't drive,

13:40.653 --> 13:43.556
and we all know that
the passenger side is

13:43.590 --> 13:44.624
the death seat.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.293
Mm, this is delicious, honey.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.596
Or, picture this, Jill,
I don't know, just skis...

13:49.629 --> 13:50.931
[grunts]
Right into a tree.

13:50.964 --> 13:54.334
- Right, total organ failure.

13:54.367 --> 13:57.570
She's brain dead,
living in a vegetative state

13:57.604 --> 14:00.007
with a string of drool
coming out of her mouth

14:00.040 --> 14:02.709
just like what happened to,
uh, Sue Menkowitz,

14:02.742 --> 14:05.378
may she rest in peace.
- Okay, shh, the kids, please.

14:05.412 --> 14:06.914
- They're in the other room.
See?

14:06.914 --> 14:10.650
He can't even have
a conversation about it.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.320
Whereas I can look at the facts
and take clear decisive action.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.255
- Hey, are you trying
to get my job here?

14:15.288 --> 14:17.991
- Mm, no, no, no, no,
now that I think about it, Andy,

14:18.025 --> 14:21.194
you had to excuse yourself
during Miles' bris.

14:21.228 --> 14:22.695
- That's different.

14:22.729 --> 14:25.432
That's my baby son's foreskin
being snipped

14:25.465 --> 14:27.234
in front of thirty people
kibbitzing.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.602
- Uh, that's
a barbaric tradition

14:29.636 --> 14:32.439
I agree.
That is not a good test.

14:32.472 --> 14:35.943
- Oh, now, now, now,
I don't think it's barbaric.

14:35.943 --> 14:39.012
In fact, I imagine that all
the men here are circumcised,

14:39.046 --> 14:41.014
am I right?
- Mother, please.

14:41.048 --> 14:44.952
- And Fielding, of course,
had an unclipped saucisson,

14:44.985 --> 14:46.086
but I got used to it.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.787
- Ugh.
- Mom!

14:47.820 --> 14:49.556
- Mom!
- God!

14:49.589 --> 14:51.758
- [stammers]
Can we get back to the will?

14:51.791 --> 14:53.426
- Yes.
I'm a pragmatist.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.029
If someone is on life support
and they are not coming back,

14:56.063 --> 14:58.531
I am pulling the plug.
- Really?

14:58.565 --> 15:01.434
Even for me with
the ski-into-a-tree scenario?

15:01.468 --> 15:03.870
- Pulling the plug over a little
drool seems excessive, but--

15:03.971 --> 15:06.606
- Babe, the day
I can't remember our kids names,

15:06.639 --> 15:08.875
I wanna be offed.
- Fine, you win.

15:08.976 --> 15:10.510
You're dead.
Happy?

15:10.543 --> 15:12.612
- Oh.
- Yes, I feel much better.

15:12.645 --> 15:13.713
Thank you.
- Great.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.048
Can we talk about
something else?

15:15.082 --> 15:17.550
Anything else.
- Well, in the spirit

15:17.584 --> 15:19.619
of your little holiday,

15:19.652 --> 15:21.989
I've been doing
some reflecting myself,

15:21.989 --> 15:24.491
and it occurred to me that
back in the '80s

15:24.524 --> 15:29.129
I had a few dinner dates
with Bill Cosby.

15:29.162 --> 15:31.464
- Oh.
- He never laid a hand on me.

15:31.498 --> 15:34.134
Not even once.
I mean, I'm haunted by it.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.036
You should have
seen me back then.

15:36.069 --> 15:39.039
I was--I was a knockout.

15:39.072 --> 15:41.241
Wait, I have a picture
in my purse.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.143
- Burberry straightjacket.

15:43.176 --> 15:45.245
- Kids, dessert.

15:50.017 --> 15:50.450
- What took you so long?

15:52.019 --> 15:53.720
You missed an actual trip
to Hades.

15:53.753 --> 15:57.390
We all boarded an Amtrak train
and went to Hades together.

15:57.424 --> 16:00.760
- Sorry, Elliot keeps swinging
from hot to hid,

16:00.793 --> 16:02.329
and now it's speeding up.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.897
It's like
I have sexual schizophprenia.

16:04.931 --> 16:07.067
- Why?
He looks fine to me.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.036
- Ugh.

16:09.036 --> 16:11.071
Ugh, I gotta go deal with this.

16:11.104 --> 16:13.240
- No, don't do anything rash.
This is normal.

16:13.273 --> 16:14.541
Everyone has this.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.343
- Has what?

16:16.376 --> 16:17.344
[door closes]

16:17.377 --> 16:18.911
- Sorry I'm so late.

16:18.945 --> 16:20.313
Rough day at the office.

16:20.347 --> 16:21.881
both: Hi, Brooke.

16:21.914 --> 16:25.052
- Jill, I'm sure today
must have been hard for you

16:25.085 --> 16:27.254
because you're not used
to fasting.

16:27.287 --> 16:28.921
- Hi, Brooke.

16:28.955 --> 16:31.724
Happy holiday.
- What do you want, Lex?

16:31.758 --> 16:33.860
- Well, I just wanted
to let you know

16:33.893 --> 16:35.862
that I fasted today

16:35.895 --> 16:39.399
to atone for what I put you
and our family through,

16:39.432 --> 16:41.701
and...

16:41.734 --> 16:43.203
[sighs]

16:43.236 --> 16:45.105
I miss you.

16:45.138 --> 16:46.739
I miss our homes.

16:46.773 --> 16:49.509
I miss our kids.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.544
- Well, I wish
you'd considered that

16:51.578 --> 16:54.081
before you made a mockery
of our wedding vows.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.515
- So do I.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.117
I was in pain,

16:57.150 --> 17:01.354
and I acted out
instead of reaching out.

17:01.388 --> 17:04.124
I'm just asking
for a second chance.

17:04.157 --> 17:05.525
- I've already talked to you

17:05.558 --> 17:07.694
more than I promised myself
I would.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.296
I suggest you eat something.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.898
You smell like you have
an eating disorder.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.867
Vanessa, it's good to see you.

17:14.901 --> 17:16.936
- Thanks, you too.

17:16.969 --> 17:18.371
This purse is cool.

17:18.405 --> 17:21.274
- Oh, thanks,
it's one of my designs.

17:21.308 --> 17:25.645
Uh, the logo is on the inside.
We're transcending labels.

17:25.678 --> 17:28.115
Actually, you should have it.

17:28.148 --> 17:30.117
- Me?

17:30.117 --> 17:31.351
Really?

17:31.384 --> 17:32.952
- Sure.

17:32.985 --> 17:35.122
- That's really nice.

17:35.122 --> 17:36.489
- Oh, wow.

17:36.523 --> 17:39.226
That is doing wonders
for you already.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.561
It really amplifies
your "inner-light,"

17:41.594 --> 17:43.130
as Joy Green would say.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.964
- Wait, is that
the "Joy Manifesto" lady?

17:44.997 --> 17:47.634
I keep hearing about that.
- Yeah, you want my copy?

17:47.667 --> 17:49.001
I've got ten more at home.

17:49.035 --> 17:51.204
- Thanks.
- Sure.

17:51.238 --> 17:53.540
Happy Yom Kippur, you guys.
- Thanks.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.743
- Brooke, may I offer you
a bagel or some kugel?

17:56.776 --> 17:58.845
- Jill, I'm not an animal,

17:58.878 --> 18:00.713
but I did want you to know

18:00.747 --> 18:04.151
that I also spent today
reflecting on the past year.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.486
[sighs]
The truth is,

18:06.519 --> 18:08.455
I've been holding
onto some anger

18:08.488 --> 18:11.158
since the troubles,

18:11.158 --> 18:12.792
but...

18:12.825 --> 18:14.594
I forgive you, Jill.

18:14.627 --> 18:17.964
- Okay, but it seems like
you're forgetting that--

18:17.997 --> 18:19.299
- Oh, no.
I don't forget,

18:19.332 --> 18:20.933
but I do forgive,

18:20.967 --> 18:23.336
and now you need
to forgive yourself

18:23.370 --> 18:25.772
for what you put me through.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.240
Can you do that?

18:27.274 --> 18:28.808
- I think I can.

18:29.842 --> 18:31.244
- One, two, three, four.

18:31.278 --> 18:34.247
[rock music]

18:34.281 --> 18:36.283
*

18:38.050 --> 18:40.187
- And pajamas now, kids.

18:40.187 --> 18:42.822
- Has anyone seen Vanessa?

18:42.855 --> 18:45.692
- You okay, babe?
- Yeah, I got a splinter,

18:45.725 --> 18:47.194
and it's,
like, in my blind spot.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.428
I can't--see?
- Oh, yeah.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.962
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yep.
I see.

18:49.996 --> 18:51.531
It's tiny.
- Ow, ow.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.099
- Ooh, oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.302
- No, it's okay.
Do--do what has to be done.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.470
- Okay, I just--
I don't want to hurt you.

18:57.504 --> 18:58.605
Okay.
- Just swoop in there.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.307
- Yep, okay.
- Just--

19:00.340 --> 19:02.709
- Come on, grow a pair.
Just do it, just do it.

19:02.742 --> 19:05.111
- Oh--I'm doing it.
I'm doing what needs to be done.

19:05.212 --> 19:06.112
[dramatic music]

19:06.213 --> 19:07.880
Oh...
- [grunting]

19:07.914 --> 19:11.218
- Doing it.
Oh, God, oh.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.752
[cringes]
Oh, God, it's bleeding.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.787
It's bleeding.
- Oh, for Chrissake.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.889
If you can't even
pull out a splinter--

19:16.923 --> 19:19.926
- I know.
Who was I kidding?

19:19.959 --> 19:21.561
If you were on life support

19:21.594 --> 19:24.030
and there was
a 0% chance of survival,

19:24.063 --> 19:26.032
I would spend
the rest of my days

19:26.065 --> 19:29.402
scouring the earth trying
to find a cure.

19:29.436 --> 19:30.870
- It's okay.
It's okay.

19:30.903 --> 19:33.873
[paper ripping]

19:40.247 --> 19:40.813
- It takes serious chutzpah

19:42.615 --> 19:44.917
to leave your own break-fast
in the middle of dessert.

19:44.951 --> 19:48.455
- I like to start the New Year
off with something to atone for.

19:48.488 --> 19:50.122
Right off the bat.

19:50.156 --> 19:52.992
Okay, back to Elliot.
Did you finally do it?

19:53.025 --> 19:55.795
- If by "do it" you mean have
sex in your broom closet,

19:55.828 --> 19:57.297
then, yes.

19:57.330 --> 20:00.032
Huge apologies.
- What?

20:00.066 --> 20:02.134
- It started with me
paving the way to a breakup,

20:02.168 --> 20:04.971
I swear, but then
he suddenly turned hot again,

20:05.004 --> 20:07.307
so I just went with it.
The stats are averaging out

20:07.340 --> 20:11.010
to me finding him hot,
like, 65% of the time,

20:11.043 --> 20:13.212
and 35% hiddy.

20:13.246 --> 20:15.482
Is that bad?
- Wait a minute.

20:15.515 --> 20:18.685
Okay, carry the one.
Yep, I have news for you:

20:18.718 --> 20:20.653
that's about how it breaks down
with Andy and me.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.188
Give or take.
- Really?

20:22.221 --> 20:25.558
- Yeah, so maybe...
* Elliot's the one

20:25.592 --> 20:27.026
- Wow, give it a rest.

20:27.059 --> 20:30.430
[upbeat music]

20:32.231 --> 20:33.733
- I hope you'll forgive me

20:33.766 --> 20:35.502
for going with Vanessa
as my plug-puller,

20:35.535 --> 20:37.804
but I needed someone
with a thicker skin.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.672
- I get it.
I get it.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.009
- And I want you to know

20:43.042 --> 20:46.746
I am so happy
to still be your executioner.

20:46.779 --> 20:49.549
- You know, thanks, but I think
I'm gonna go another way.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.018
- Another way?
What does that mean?

20:52.051 --> 20:54.587
- I want extreme measures, babe.
[clears throat]

20:54.621 --> 20:57.189
I don't mind waiting around
for a decade or two

20:57.223 --> 20:58.825
while they come up
with a way to revive me,

20:58.858 --> 21:02.161
so for my plug-puller,

21:02.194 --> 21:04.597
I'm going with Frank
from the gym.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.766
- Wait, Frank,
the guy with the gappy teeth?

21:06.799 --> 21:08.635
- Yep.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.939
Love you.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.341
[dramatic music]

21:14.341 --> 21:16.609
- [grunts]

21:16.643 --> 21:18.411
[exhales]
That's better.

21:18.445 --> 21:19.412
I love you too.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.448

21:23.350 --> 21:26.252

21:30.357 --> 21:32.024
- Left, right, left, right
left, right.
