Mexico is a country where

00:07.808 --> 00:13.246
every day, people fight to live.

00:13.247 --> 00:19.219
All too often, they
lose that battle.

00:19.220 --> 00:23.990
The magnificent, heartbreakingly

00:23.991 --> 00:26.759
beautiful country, the music and

Holy mother of Santa Muerte,
please protect my stash of

01:43.404 --> 01:44.004
cocaine.

01:44.005 --> 01:45.972
Let it not be interfered with by

01:45.973 --> 01:49.409
the cops, or the competition.

01:49.410 --> 01:53.813
Let any who would mess
with me be killed.

My enemies destroyed.

01:56.484 --> 02:04.484
Please forgive us our
sins, for they are many.

02:08.196 --> 02:09.729
So is business good?

02:09.729 --> 02:12.832
I mean, is there more murders

02:12.833 --> 02:20.673
particularly narco murders?

[ Speaking in a

02:36.023 --> 02:40.193
Every day, Mexico wakes
up to count the dead.

02:40.194 --> 02:46.032
They are, after all,
left out to be seen.

02:46.033 --> 02:49.269
Often with a helpful note,

02:49.270 --> 02:53.973
identifying who done what and
generally speaking, why.

02:53.974 --> 02:55.942
There is a language to the

02:55.943 --> 02:57.744
never-ending violence, a coded

02:57.745 --> 03:02.749
message in the twists and
marks of the bodies.

03:02.750 --> 03:06.486
And Valente Rojas is one of many

03:06.487 --> 03:07.554
documenting them for the press.

03:07.555 --> 03:10.490
This is what he does every

03:10.491 --> 03:12.058
night, rides around waiting for

03:12.059 --> 03:14.461
a phone call or a radio message

03:14.462 --> 03:18.831
telling him that
there's another one.

Here, you kill each
other for a reason.

03:47.261 --> 03:49.929
It's business?

03:49.930 --> 03:51.097
Si.

03:51.098 --> 03:53.433
More Mexican civilians have

03:53.434 --> 03:56.035
been killed since 2006 than all

the American military lost in

eight years of wars in Iraq.

What do you do if you're one of

04:06.380 --> 04:07.847
these cops, you're driving

04:07.848 --> 04:09.449
around one night, you see some

04:09.450 --> 04:14.487
guy outside of a bar beating
somebody or disturbing the

04:14.488 --> 04:16.188
peace, you start to arrest him

04:16.189 --> 04:18.858
and he's got a diamond studded

04:18.858 --> 04:20.793
pistol, it's got his name on it.

04:20.793 --> 04:24.063
Now you realize you've just

04:24.064 --> 04:28.034
arrested somebody with
serious connections.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.237
What do you do?

04:32.172 --> 04:32.506
Let him go?

Si.

04:38.312 --> 04:42.515
Why do they always
pull their pants down?

04:42.516 --> 04:44.751
Our local fixer, Alex,
is here to translate.

04:44.752 --> 04:47.153
In this case, he thinks that

04:47.154 --> 04:51.057
they pull the pants down
so check for weapons.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.159
They are loading
them into the sheet.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.227
This is the CSI team so when

04:55.228 --> 04:56.262
they were pulling his pants off,

04:56.263 --> 04:59.065
money and jewelry started
falling from the pockets.

04:59.066 --> 05:01.601
Basically, they took the money

05:01.602 --> 05:04.937
out his pockets and that was
the only available spot.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.439
To show they didn't
take anything.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.840
Yeah, exactly.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.776
So this is also a drug dealer.

05:09.777 --> 05:12.579
The thing here in Mexico, as
soon as someone's killed,

05:12.580 --> 05:16.583
normally they get candles
just right next to them.

05:16.584 --> 05:19.352
Sometimes it's related to
drug dealings and criminals.

05:19.353 --> 05:22.522
How long have you
been doing this?

05:22.523 --> 05:23.523
About nine years.

05:23.524 --> 05:28.428
How many bodies do you think?

05:28.429 --> 05:28.696
Hundreds?

05:28.697 --> 05:29.762
Si.

How do you push them out of
your mind when you're not

A lot of people ask
him about this.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.539
But he said like it's a job, not

05:39.540 --> 05:41.608
like any other kind of job, but

05:41.609 --> 05:45.111
as soon as he gets home, he just

05:45.112 --> 05:49.215
takes this cover off
and just keep living.

05:49.216 --> 05:50.216
That's a terrible picture.

She run away from a circus so

05:58.426 --> 06:02.061
she basically was crossing the

highway and just run over.

The world we live in now, of

all of these pictures, this is

the one that would get people

around the world.

And this is the most
important picture.

As our crew gets ready to

06:28.856 --> 06:31.524
crawl back to our hotel, Valente

06:31.525 --> 06:33.960
gets the call we thought
we had been waiting for.

One dead male, shot in head.

A note pinned to his chest.

In Mexico, people fight
to live every day.

06:52.112 --> 06:55.948
One man stands alone,
facing another man.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.950
His intent, to beat his opponent

06:57.951 --> 07:05.951
with his fists until
he can resist no more.

07:06.894 --> 07:14.894
A match, yes, but more
accurately, a fight.

Jorge is a former bantamweight

Jorge senior and his son Alexis,

07:35.756 --> 07:38.691
the Santa Anita neighborhood
of Mexico City.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.326
He knows these young men, like

07:40.327 --> 07:41.561
generations of boxers everywhere

07:41.562 --> 07:42.329
from other neighborhoods like

07:42.330 --> 07:50.330
this, are looking for a way out.

07:50.871 --> 07:56.208
In Mexico, boxing is kind

07:56.209 --> 07:59.879
of... boxing give them
a little discipline.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.347
Say you're good but
not that good.

08:01.348 --> 08:04.416
Can you make a living
just being a contender?

08:04.417 --> 08:08.054
No, but a lot of fighters,
they try to make it.

08:08.055 --> 08:10.690
They want to be a champion.

08:10.691 --> 08:11.625
Everybody wants
to be a champion.

08:11.626 --> 08:15.562
Everybody.

08:15.563 --> 08:16.363
Everybody wants the big shot.

08:16.364 --> 08:18.898
Those are bad odds.

08:18.899 --> 08:24.103
The history of
boxing is not kind.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.572
Most managers and owners don't

08:25.573 --> 08:26.739
give a... about the fighters.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.374
They use them up but at the end

08:28.375 --> 08:29.709
they leave a guy all broken

08:29.710 --> 08:32.611
down, no money and
scrambled brains.

08:32.613 --> 08:35.246
Just like prostitutes,
you know what I mean?

08:35.248 --> 08:41.486
What are your options?

08:41.488 --> 08:43.590
Nothing.

08:43.591 --> 08:44.391
Snatching, robbing.

08:44.392 --> 08:47.093
Like kids in the hood
go kidnap that guy.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.127
Big industry.

08:48.128 --> 08:51.998
Everybody here now wants
to be a soccer player.

08:51.999 --> 08:52.332
Why boxing?

08:52.333 --> 08:54.934
Because they make money.

08:54.935 --> 08:57.904
Who's got a longer career,
a narco or a boxer?

08:57.905 --> 09:03.075
I don't know.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.011
Might be 50/50.

09:05.012 --> 09:07.413
Narco, you can last longer.

09:07.414 --> 09:07.748
You can.

09:07.749 --> 09:09.015
You are protected by the police.

09:09.016 --> 09:13.185
You just pay off, nobody's
going to touch you.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.521
Expensive protein shakes and

09:15.522 --> 09:18.758
dietary supplements,
not so much.

09:18.759 --> 09:22.829
Boxers here eat what
they can afford.

09:22.830 --> 09:26.465
The food is good and it's cheap.

09:26.466 --> 09:30.436
You know, in Mexico, there
is no middle class.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.471
You are either poor or
really, really rich.

09:32.472 --> 09:33.773
It's a crazy thing.

09:33.774 --> 09:36.609
The minimum wage here is like

09:36.610 --> 09:39.478
50, 60 pesos, which
is like five bucks.

09:39.479 --> 09:41.948
Not an hour, a day.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.215
But on the other hand, that's

09:43.216 --> 09:45.117
why Mexican fighters
are so exciting.

09:45.118 --> 09:45.485
They're hungry.

09:45.486 --> 09:46.653
Exactly.

09:46.654 --> 09:51.591
We're hungry.

10:08.341 --> 10:14.981
Topito is a city
within its city.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.015
Either the dark center or the

10:16.016 --> 10:17.149
beating heart of Mexico City,

10:17.150 --> 10:22.054
depending on your point of view.

10:22.055 --> 10:30.055
It's the home of Santa Muerta,
the skeletal St. death.

10:30.363 --> 10:34.500
This is where they come, the

10:34.501 --> 10:36.936
impoverished, the oppressed, the

10:36.937 --> 10:41.708
marginalized, the criminal.

10:41.709 --> 10:43.710
People for whom the traditional

10:43.711 --> 10:47.379
church has less relevancy.

10:47.380 --> 10:50.717
For the unforgiven and
the unforgiveable.

10:50.718 --> 10:52.418
For those on whom the catholic

10:52.419 --> 10:58.891
saints have turned their
backs, there is Santa Muerte.

10:58.892 --> 11:01.393
This is a place and Santa Muerte

11:01.394 --> 11:03.462
is a Saint that
accepts everybody.

11:03.463 --> 11:07.734
Death to my enemies written
on a votive candle.

11:07.735 --> 11:09.068
Let's face it, we have all

11:09.069 --> 11:16.075
prayed for that at one
point or another.

11:16.076 --> 11:16.710
Topito is a poor neighborhood,

11:16.711 --> 11:19.746
for sure, and a tough one.

11:19.747 --> 11:27.747
A center of commerce both
above-board and not.

11:33.761 --> 11:35.561
Perhaps a breakfast
beverage first.

11:35.562 --> 11:37.797
A michelada.

11:37.798 --> 11:40.132
One giant beer with lemon, chili

11:40.133 --> 11:43.602
powder, salt and magi sauce.

11:43.603 --> 11:45.772
That's a sizeable
morning beverage.

11:45.773 --> 11:50.609
My companion, blogger and
chronicler of the city, Jorge

11:50.610 --> 11:50.811
Pedro.

11:50.811 --> 11:51.344
Wow.

11:51.345 --> 11:55.314
A whole season of the
walking dead for 25 cents.

11:55.315 --> 11:58.951
You want to buy something,
Topito's got it.

11:58.952 --> 12:02.321
Looking for some cheap
underwear, pirated copies of man

12:02.322 --> 12:03.689
versus food seasons
one through five?

12:03.690 --> 12:06.125
This is where you find them.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.294
So this all seems
very wholesome.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.863
Where can I buy a gun, some
heroin and a prostitute.

12:10.864 --> 12:13.299
I was looking forward to that.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.935
Let's say Topito
has many layers.

12:15.936 --> 12:16.369
Right.

12:16.370 --> 12:17.870
And we are in the surface.

12:17.871 --> 12:18.605
Okay.

12:18.606 --> 12:25.711
We are among movies,
clothing, families.

12:25.712 --> 12:28.714
But I don't think it's... to ask

12:28.715 --> 12:30.182
where can I get the gun.

12:30.183 --> 12:38.183
Probably they will kill
you if you ask that.

12:39.059 --> 12:42.128
You know the patron Saint
of hopeless cases.

12:42.129 --> 12:42.996
Lost causes.

12:42.997 --> 12:46.498
It's become very popular
in the last years.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.868
A lot of good smells here, man.

12:48.869 --> 12:54.506
A lot of good-looking food.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.242
My happy place is
somewhere in here.

12:56.243 --> 13:00.312
Oh, there it is.

13:00.313 --> 13:00.547
Yeah.

13:00.548 --> 13:03.315
Beautiful.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.351
Wherever there's bones and guts

13:05.352 --> 13:09.922
simmering in broth, chances
are I'll be happy.

13:09.923 --> 13:14.760
Writer, sociologist and
life-long resident of Topito,

13:14.761 --> 13:17.529
Alphonso Hernandez, apparently
feels the same way.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.065
Is this supposed to be
a bad neighborhood?

13:19.066 --> 13:19.499
This is the best.

13:19.500 --> 13:24.536
I love this neighborhood.

13:24.537 --> 13:32.537
This is known for being the
lost souls neighborhood.

13:34.281 --> 13:37.249
In Topito, there are no
angels but lost souls.

13:37.250 --> 13:45.250
What's the saying?

13:53.533 --> 13:55.801
Show your... to the devil?

13:55.802 --> 13:56.736
To death.

13:56.737 --> 13:58.570
The boil comes from cracked

13:58.571 --> 14:01.773
hambones to release the marrow

14:01.774 --> 14:07.146
which onion and pepper is added.

14:07.147 --> 14:12.418
Thickened with stale bread
and leftover tortillas.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.820
You make something
awesome out of nothing.

14:14.821 --> 14:19.892
Grandmothers take advantage
of the bones of the pigs.

14:19.893 --> 14:23.062
Any great old culture where
there's poverty, there's

14:23.063 --> 14:25.331
something like this.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.833
If you're watching this after

14:27.834 --> 14:29.401
you do this, you really got to

14:29.402 --> 14:32.471
wash your hands before you touch

14:32.472 --> 14:38.410
your... that's a rookie mistake.

14:38.411 --> 14:41.480
She's asking you if
you like the meal.

14:41.481 --> 14:41.949
Yeah, it's good.

14:41.950 --> 14:47.419
Delicious.

14:47.420 --> 14:48.955
So this has been open 65 years?

14:48.956 --> 14:51.523
All the members of the
crew are relatives.

14:51.524 --> 14:55.827
Is there hope for social
change in this country?

14:55.828 --> 14:58.130
Unfortunately, Mexico has

14:58.131 --> 15:01.968
become the Topito of the world.

15:01.969 --> 15:04.303
Topito, this is still the
emphasis of the Mexican.

15:04.304 --> 15:07.173
Not a lot of upward
mobility here.

15:07.174 --> 15:09.841
The rich get richer, the poor

15:09.842 --> 15:15.948
get ground slowly
under the wheel.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.683
Edwardo Garcia has hacked his

15:17.684 --> 15:19.218
way up the ladder to become chef

15:19.219 --> 15:21.087
owner of the city's
hottest restaurant.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.022
I grew up in the states.

15:22.023 --> 15:24.156
I was a migrant worker picking

15:24.157 --> 15:25.624
fruits and vegetables as a kid.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.359
My parents didn't earn a lot of

15:27.360 --> 15:32.898
money, so I decided to work
rather than go to school.

15:32.899 --> 15:37.136
The restaurant business as I
well know ain't no picnic.

15:37.137 --> 15:40.339
In Mexico City, it's
particularly rough.

15:40.340 --> 15:43.209
Mexico has a reputation where

15:43.210 --> 15:49.481
we all know that the country's
run by corrupt politics.

15:49.482 --> 15:52.084
You have to stand up
for what you believe.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.852
If you don't, people
will run you over.

15:53.853 --> 15:57.156
You won't last a minute.

15:57.157 --> 16:02.594
I don't let people
bully me around.

16:02.595 --> 16:10.595
Garcia runs Maximo bistro
with his wife, Gabriella.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.838
Here's the extra crap you have

16:12.839 --> 16:14.340
to deal with if you run the

16:14.341 --> 16:15.707
hottest restaurant
in Mexico city.

16:15.708 --> 16:18.010
In 2013, the spoiled daughter of

16:18.011 --> 16:19.878
the head of Mexico's consumer

16:19.879 --> 16:21.180
protection agency walks in and

16:21.181 --> 16:24.850
demands a table when there's
unsurprisingly, no table

16:24.851 --> 16:25.118
available.

16:25.119 --> 16:27.686
When Garcia says sorry, no can

16:27.687 --> 16:29.555
do, she pulls a you know who I

16:29.556 --> 16:31.123
am and then calls daddy and gets

16:31.124 --> 16:36.395
the health inspectors in
to shut the place down.

16:36.396 --> 16:38.964
So your other customers
basically started taking

16:38.965 --> 16:40.232
pictures with their cell phones?

16:40.233 --> 16:42.368
Next thing you know, we have

16:42.369 --> 16:44.403
the media outside
and this is Friday.

16:44.404 --> 16:45.937
Right.

16:45.938 --> 16:48.207
Sunday morning, we're front
page of one of the most

16:48.208 --> 16:49.975
important newspapers in Mexico.

16:49.976 --> 16:52.411
It was very embarrassing
to the government.

16:52.412 --> 16:53.412
And it should be.

16:53.413 --> 16:54.446
Because they got caught doing

16:54.447 --> 16:56.048
what they do all the time but if

16:56.049 --> 16:58.650
you were not the hottest
restaurant in town, you were

16:58.651 --> 17:01.387
just running a cantina
a few blocks away...

17:01.388 --> 17:02.754
I would have... they
would have closed you

17:02.755 --> 17:08.260
down and that's that.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.796
Right now, the defiant young

17:10.797 --> 17:11.896
creative generation of chefs

17:11.897 --> 17:13.765
like Edwardo are performing some

17:13.766 --> 17:14.933
of the most exciting cooking

17:14.934 --> 17:16.135
anywhere on earth, a mixing of

17:16.136 --> 17:24.136
the very old and traditional
with the very new.

17:24.944 --> 17:26.845
As a kid, one of the jobs

17:26.846 --> 17:30.116
throughout the whole time that I

17:30.117 --> 17:31.783
worked is how old
are you, I'm 18.

17:31.784 --> 17:36.455
You've been 18 for three years.

17:36.456 --> 17:39.125
Those are abilone.

17:39.126 --> 17:40.659
I told you I love butter.

17:40.660 --> 17:43.762
I use it even for some Mexican

17:43.763 --> 17:44.963
dishes and then just roasted

17:44.964 --> 17:47.833
chilies just to give it a
nice little kick for me.

17:47.834 --> 17:48.801
They are finished with lemon

17:48.802 --> 17:50.769
and of course, brown butter.

17:50.770 --> 17:53.939
Beautiful.

17:53.940 --> 17:54.107
Mm.

17:54.108 --> 17:56.808
Very delicious.

17:56.809 --> 17:59.978
Very Mexican, very French.

17:59.979 --> 18:00.780
Brown butter, awesome.

18:00.781 --> 18:01.947
Makes everything better.

18:01.948 --> 18:04.883
Of course.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.152
I think the most important thing

18:06.153 --> 18:07.686
about Mexican cuisine in general

18:07.687 --> 18:13.525
if it's traditional,
it's the ingredients.

18:13.526 --> 18:17.963
Successling pig topped
with grandma's salsa.

18:17.964 --> 18:18.398
An instant classic.

18:18.399 --> 18:19.798
Have at it.

18:19.799 --> 18:22.000
You do it like the Mexican way.

18:22.001 --> 18:28.307
Pick it up and go.

18:28.308 --> 18:28.841
Wow.

18:28.842 --> 18:31.543
Pretty hard to imagine
anything better than that.

18:31.544 --> 18:34.180
You're stuck with this
dish forever, man.

18:34.181 --> 18:36.582
It's going to be like Mick

18:36.583 --> 18:38.650
Jagger 50 years from now
singing "satisfaction."

18:38.651 --> 18:39.918
There's no getting
away from it, man.

18:39.919 --> 18:40.320
This is so good.

18:40.321 --> 18:42.921
This is a classic.

18:42.922 --> 18:46.358
But even now with all his
success, Garcia is still

18:46.359 --> 18:48.327
fighting a struggle most
Mexicans are all too familiar

18:48.328 --> 18:51.197
with.

18:51.198 --> 18:55.033
What happened that day
happens every day.

18:55.034 --> 18:56.268
And the promise always is we're

18:56.269 --> 18:59.338
going to shut you down,
you don't know who I am.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.207
And for me, I would rather close

19:01.208 --> 19:04.210
my restaurant than
live like that.

19:04.211 --> 19:05.577
If you close my restaurant, I

19:05.578 --> 19:07.213
will go across the street, I

19:07.214 --> 19:08.880
will go to another state or I

19:08.881 --> 19:11.750
will go to another country, and

19:11.751 --> 19:15.988
I still will make a
good restaurant.

19:32.539 --> 19:37.909
Under former president Felipe
Calderon, Mexico launched

19:37.910 --> 19:40.746
a concerted war on drugs.

19:40.747 --> 19:41.980
Ostensibly against the notorious

19:41.981 --> 19:46.151
and seemingly
untouchable cartels.

19:46.152 --> 19:47.319
Absolutely no one can say with

19:47.320 --> 19:52.758
any credibility, by the way,
that Mexico's war or our

19:52.759 --> 19:54.726
trillion dollar war has had any

19:54.727 --> 19:56.428
effect in diminishing the flow

19:56.429 --> 20:01.400
of drugs into our country.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.769
One very brave journalist has

20:03.770 --> 20:05.604
uncovered exactly how deep the

20:05.605 --> 20:07.005
rot of corruption and dirty

20:07.006 --> 20:09.341
money has penetrated into every

20:09.342 --> 20:17.342
level of Mexican institutions.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.686
My grandmother, how we used

20:20.687 --> 20:24.756
to drink is never with
lemon, it was with orange.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.292
It is not what a lot of

20:26.293 --> 20:28.794
people wanted to hear,
much less see published.

20:28.795 --> 20:36.134
Today, Anibelle Hernandez
lives under guard in a secret

20:36.135 --> 20:36.403
location.

20:36.404 --> 20:40.672
The threat, very, very
real and very explicit.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.508
You think there was ever a

20:42.509 --> 20:44.643
minute when the Calderon war on

20:44.644 --> 20:45.211
drugs, was it ever genuine?

20:45.212 --> 20:48.480
No.

20:48.481 --> 20:49.715
Calderon start the war against

20:49.716 --> 20:55.687
the drug cartels, he just

20:55.688 --> 20:57.489
followed that instruction but he

20:57.490 --> 21:02.160
didn't really do anything new.

21:02.161 --> 21:03.329
He just did it worse.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.664
Since the beginning, the plan

21:05.665 --> 21:07.666
was protect the cartel and fight

21:07.667 --> 21:12.070
against the enemies
of this cartel.

21:12.071 --> 21:17.042
Of the seven major Mexican

21:17.043 --> 21:19.511
cartels, the Cineloa cartel is

21:19.512 --> 21:20.246
considered the most powerful

21:20.247 --> 21:24.683
with the farthest reaching
and most pervasive tentacles

21:24.684 --> 21:26.251
extending deep into every corner

21:26.252 --> 21:30.188
of government, banking
and private industry.

21:30.189 --> 21:34.225
Its rivals, the Tijuana cartel,

21:34.226 --> 21:39.230
the Gulf cartel, the Juarez

21:39.231 --> 21:45.203
cartel, la Familia Micharcana.

21:45.204 --> 21:47.339
The cartels are responsible for

21:47.340 --> 21:48.407
importing roughly three quarters

21:48.408 --> 21:54.946
of all illegal
narcotics to America.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.682
In your work, you uncovered what

21:56.683 --> 21:58.384
had to be some very embarrassing

21:58.385 --> 22:01.219
and incriminating associations

22:01.220 --> 22:04.390
and connections between very

22:04.391 --> 22:09.361
high elected officials,
the presidents and entire

22:09.362 --> 22:12.531
administrations, and acts
of incredible criminality.

22:12.532 --> 22:15.401
How did that change your life?

22:15.402 --> 22:18.370
When I started to make this

22:18.371 --> 22:24.075
investigation in 2005, I really

22:24.076 --> 22:27.145
understand that it would
be very dangerous.

22:27.146 --> 22:30.416
I have to say that it wasn't

22:30.417 --> 22:34.753
really a surprise for me what

22:34.754 --> 22:37.889
happened after I
published my book.

22:37.890 --> 22:39.658
What I didn't expect is that the

22:39.659 --> 22:42.594
threats came from the
federal government.

22:42.595 --> 22:45.664
She says that one of her
sources warned her that the

22:45.665 --> 22:47.433
biggest threat was from within,

22:47.434 --> 22:50.602
that one of the most highly
placed, most senior law

22:50.603 --> 22:54.640
enforcement officials in
Mexico had ordered her killed.

22:54.641 --> 23:02.448
Because in my book, I put his
name and also showed some

23:02.449 --> 23:04.082
documents that proves that he

23:04.083 --> 23:07.118
was involved, he was on the
payroll of this cartel.

23:07.119 --> 23:08.654
What happened to this man?

23:08.655 --> 23:12.257
Right now, he's very happy

23:12.258 --> 23:19.297
drinking rum, I think, building
many enterprises, fake

23:19.298 --> 23:20.799
enterprises, laundry his money.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.602
To me, a banker who launders

23:23.603 --> 23:25.103
money, he's got a family, he's

23:25.104 --> 23:26.605
got a reputation, he gives money

23:26.606 --> 23:27.939
to charity, his neighbors think

23:27.940 --> 23:29.808
he's great, his kids think he's

23:29.809 --> 23:31.943
wonderful, he's got
something to lose.

23:31.944 --> 23:33.712
So I wouldn't be
prosecuting drug dealers.

23:33.713 --> 23:35.280
I would be prosecuting bankers.

23:35.281 --> 23:43.281
The name of my book is what

23:43.355 --> 23:45.791
it is because the leaders of

23:45.792 --> 23:52.130
these cartels know,
they are also this.

23:52.131 --> 23:55.166
The politicians and bankers and

23:55.167 --> 23:56.702
the businessmen, the people have

23:56.703 --> 24:00.171
to know who are these
people by name.

24:00.172 --> 24:02.073
You have been a
journalist for how long?

24:02.074 --> 24:02.542
20.

24:02.542 --> 24:03.175
20 years.

24:03.175 --> 24:03.876
20 years.

24:03.877 --> 24:07.846
Your father was killed,
kidnapped and killed in 2000?

24:07.847 --> 24:12.250
My father was a businessman.

24:12.251 --> 24:14.419
In that year, many gangs used to

24:14.420 --> 24:18.924
kidnap businessmen
just for money.

24:18.925 --> 24:21.860
So when we went to the police

24:21.861 --> 24:23.428
and asked them to investigate,

24:23.429 --> 24:27.032
they said well, if you pay us,

24:27.033 --> 24:30.035
we will make the investigation.

24:30.036 --> 24:33.872
So as family, we decide to pay

24:33.873 --> 24:37.008
because you cannot
buy the justice.

24:37.009 --> 24:39.911
Since that, I really tried
to fight against corruption.

24:39.912 --> 24:42.914
That's why I'm doing what I do,

24:42.915 --> 24:45.350
because I think that corruption

24:45.351 --> 24:48.053
is the worst problem in Mexico.

24:48.054 --> 24:51.857
The drug cartels are maybe the

24:51.858 --> 24:55.060
worst face of that problem, but

24:55.061 --> 24:56.862
the problem in the deep
is the corruption.

24:56.863 --> 24:58.697
The corruption is the mother of

24:58.698 --> 25:00.098
all our problems in Mexico.

25:00.099 --> 25:03.935
It should be pointed out that
88 journalists, how many

25:03.936 --> 25:05.637
journalists have been
killed in this country?

25:05.638 --> 25:06.372
90 now.

25:06.373 --> 25:08.740
90 journalists have now been

25:08.741 --> 25:10.308
killed or disappeared
over the last few years.

25:10.309 --> 25:13.378
Yeah.

25:13.379 --> 25:16.314
You can kill a journalist
and get away with it.

25:16.315 --> 25:19.651
Why are you still here?

25:19.652 --> 25:24.122
I have lost many
things in my life.

25:24.123 --> 25:30.061
My father was the most
important person in my life.

25:30.062 --> 25:30.730
I already lost everything.

25:30.731 --> 25:33.632
I don't have any life anymore.

25:33.633 --> 25:37.502
I don't have a social life.

25:37.503 --> 25:39.237
I don't have a sentimental life.

25:39.238 --> 25:39.939
I don't have anything.

25:39.940 --> 25:44.175
I just have my work
and my family.

25:44.176 --> 25:49.080
And my work of a journalist
is everything for me.

25:49.081 --> 25:50.916
I really believe that good
journalists can change the

25:50.917 --> 25:54.119
world.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.421
I have received many offers to

25:56.422 --> 26:00.358
go outside to France, to
Sweden and other countries.

26:00.359 --> 26:01.693
I don't want to leave.

26:01.694 --> 26:02.461
It's my choice.

26:02.462 --> 26:06.933
My choice is fight.

26:19.946 --> 26:24.482
I came to Ahawka for mescal.

26:24.483 --> 26:28.620
I like mescal more and more

26:28.621 --> 26:30.521
these days and this guy, Ron

26:30.522 --> 26:33.224
Cooper, finds and sells some of

26:33.225 --> 26:36.294
the best mescal in the world.

26:36.295 --> 26:44.295
We're at the Zappatec
ruins of Monte Alba.

26:45.504 --> 26:47.906
In pre-conquest Mexico, there

26:47.907 --> 26:53.011
were gods and goddesses of
intoxication and ecstasy.

26:53.012 --> 26:55.546
The touch of a lover, the smell

26:55.547 --> 27:00.752
of a flower, the a-ha of an

27:00.753 --> 27:04.322
idea, all had gods and goddesses

27:04.323 --> 27:08.994
that took responsibility
for those things.

27:08.995 --> 27:11.362
All of your mescals come from

27:11.363 --> 27:13.832
different villages and
only that village?

27:13.833 --> 27:15.734
And only one maker
in that village.

27:15.735 --> 27:18.536
We call ourself single village

27:18.537 --> 27:21.372
mescal because most mescals are

27:21.373 --> 27:23.374
made with a blend of different

27:23.375 --> 27:24.609
villages all put together.

27:24.610 --> 27:29.014
No one goes home and has a
cocktail in these Indian

27:29.015 --> 27:29.281
villages.

27:29.282 --> 27:37.282
They wait until there's
a special occasion.

27:38.891 --> 27:43.695
Every birth, death, confirmation,
baptism, there's a

27:43.696 --> 27:43.930
fiesta.

27:43.931 --> 27:46.698
A wedding is eight days.

27:46.699 --> 27:48.066
You invite 200 people.

27:48.067 --> 27:50.468
You feed them breakfast,
lunch and dinner.

27:50.469 --> 27:54.973
You have a band every day.

27:54.974 --> 28:00.278
And then they really consume.

28:00.279 --> 28:06.651
Don't drink yet.

28:06.652 --> 28:14.652
For mother earth
and her ancestors.

28:16.328 --> 28:20.131
That's extraordinary.

28:20.132 --> 28:23.134
Back in the day, it was cheap

28:23.135 --> 28:24.770
stuff with a worm in it and

28:24.771 --> 28:25.571
there were rumors that if you

28:25.572 --> 28:30.842
ate the worm, you would
start tripping, there was a

28:30.843 --> 28:32.944
hallucinogenic component
to that stuff.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.245
Is there a particular
kind of high?

28:34.246 --> 28:36.114
Is this an enlightening high?

28:36.115 --> 28:37.282
Is this a good high?

28:37.283 --> 28:38.416
The high is humorous.

28:38.417 --> 28:39.851
There are funny thoughts dancing

28:39.852 --> 28:41.186
around the back of your head.

28:41.187 --> 28:43.188
Happy, witty thoughts.

28:43.189 --> 28:44.422
Yes.

28:44.423 --> 28:47.192
Ancient, indigenous traditions
of ingredients define

28:47.193 --> 28:55.166
not only the mescal
but also the food.

28:55.167 --> 28:56.534
One of the main reasons

28:56.535 --> 29:03.274
people visit our city is to eat.

29:03.275 --> 29:09.314
This is Alejandro Romedo,
one of Mexico's best chefs.

29:09.315 --> 29:10.448
He started cooking young.

29:10.449 --> 29:11.716
When he was 12, his mother died

29:11.717 --> 29:17.222
and it fell on him to raise
and feed his five siblings.

29:17.223 --> 29:22.493
This is what we call...
Today he draws much of his

29:22.494 --> 29:24.830
inspiration from Wahawka's
central market.

29:24.831 --> 29:26.832
Probably America's most beloved

29:26.833 --> 29:27.866
food is what they think
is Mexican food.

29:27.867 --> 29:30.468
Yes.

29:30.469 --> 29:32.804
And I think most Americans'

29:32.805 --> 29:36.641
view of Mexican food is beans,

29:36.642 --> 29:39.010
fried tortilla, melted
cheese, some chicken.

29:39.011 --> 29:40.979
Yes.

29:40.980 --> 29:42.413
In fact, in particular when

29:42.414 --> 29:44.816
talking about Wahawka, this is a

29:44.817 --> 29:46.751
deep, really
sophisticated cuisine.

29:46.752 --> 29:49.754
That's correct.

29:49.755 --> 29:53.691
Wahawka has different
microclimates all over our

29:53.692 --> 29:53.993
territory.

29:53.994 --> 29:55.326
That gives us this enormous

29:55.327 --> 29:59.730
amount of surprises,
produce, fruits, chilis.

29:59.731 --> 30:01.532
Like 500,000 varieties of corn.

30:01.533 --> 30:09.407
This is where the good... grows.

30:09.408 --> 30:11.742
This lady here is
always making the best.

30:11.743 --> 30:12.578
Tender.

30:12.578 --> 30:12.945
Yes.

30:12.946 --> 30:17.048
Tender, tasty.

30:17.049 --> 30:17.683
Crunch.

30:17.684 --> 30:21.853
Cabbage and cilantro.

30:21.854 --> 30:23.588
Oh, unbelievably good.

30:23.589 --> 30:31.589
So tasty.

30:33.699 --> 30:33.866
Mm.

30:33.867 --> 30:35.533
Deep.

30:35.534 --> 30:35.801
It's good.

30:35.802 --> 30:37.702
I'll finish this.

30:37.703 --> 30:41.873
This is just too damn good.

30:41.874 --> 30:43.909
People have this barbecue
especially on Sundays.

30:43.910 --> 30:44.410
It's a tradition.

30:44.411 --> 30:52.411
So tasty.

30:53.219 --> 30:56.654
All this is full of chilis.

30:56.655 --> 30:59.790
People think that Mexican food

30:59.791 --> 31:02.593
is spicy because of
all the chili we use.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.795
We go for flavor,
not for the spices.

31:04.796 --> 31:06.998
What most people miss is
how really deep and really

31:06.999 --> 31:09.600
sophisticated the
sauces here can be.

31:09.601 --> 31:12.170
Like Lyon is to France, wahawka

31:12.171 --> 31:13.139
is to Mexico, in my experience.

31:13.140 --> 31:15.240
You're right.

31:15.241 --> 31:17.342
Also in my experience.

31:17.343 --> 31:19.110
Not kissing your ass here.

31:19.111 --> 31:23.248
I was just in Lyon.

31:23.249 --> 31:24.682
This is Vicky's place.

31:24.683 --> 31:27.318
She has been cooking up
traditional Wahawkan dishes in

31:27.319 --> 31:30.455
the market for 30 years.

31:30.456 --> 31:32.290
Whoa, that's awesome.

31:32.291 --> 31:35.160
Oh, man.

31:35.161 --> 31:37.262
So the guy working, first of

31:37.263 --> 31:39.931
all, a lot of what you
see now are metal.

31:39.932 --> 31:41.933
That's old school,
super old school.

31:41.934 --> 31:47.939
That's the way they did
back on the Clay Kamal.

31:47.940 --> 31:50.775
I'm looking there, he's doing

31:50.776 --> 31:53.278
tortillas and doing one of my

31:53.279 --> 31:57.015
favorite things, zucchini
flour with string cheese.

31:57.016 --> 31:58.016
So pretty to see.

31:58.017 --> 32:02.820
His cooking is focused, his

32:02.821 --> 32:10.821
passion have very
old, very deep roots.

32:15.301 --> 32:18.569
Since you are 6, 7, 8, you

32:18.570 --> 32:20.505
have the responsibility to help

32:20.506 --> 32:22.173
water the plantation, milk the

32:22.174 --> 32:23.541
cows and help my mom when she

32:23.542 --> 32:25.476
was making tortillas like that,

32:25.477 --> 32:26.978
she would give me directions and

32:26.979 --> 32:29.247
say okay, roll the chilis, roll

32:29.248 --> 32:32.417
the tomatoes, I will tell you
how to prepare the salsa.

32:32.418 --> 32:34.019
It was the beginning of my

32:34.020 --> 32:36.154
profession, learning from the

32:36.155 --> 32:37.855
knowledge of how a tomato should

32:37.856 --> 32:40.858
taste like when you cut it
directly from the plant.

32:40.859 --> 32:41.427
The way it should taste.

32:41.428 --> 32:46.831
That's right.

32:46.832 --> 32:48.033
Oh, man.

32:48.034 --> 32:48.234
Happy.

32:48.235 --> 32:51.936
This is what I should do.

32:51.937 --> 32:53.004
Try it first like this.

32:53.005 --> 32:54.505
Just grab a hunk.

32:54.506 --> 32:54.740
Yes.

32:54.740 --> 32:55.607
Put salsa.

32:55.608 --> 32:58.576
Yeah.

32:58.577 --> 33:02.180
I haven't been anywhere in
Mexico where the cooking is

33:02.181 --> 33:02.781
better than here.

33:02.782 --> 33:07.253
This is the way to share our
culture, through our food.

33:20.932 --> 33:26.537
The quiet little town of Teo

33:26.538 --> 33:29.574
de Kline El beye is outside of

33:29.575 --> 33:30.608
wahawka, a town where the crafts

33:30.609 --> 33:34.279
and traditions of prehispanic
Mexico are celebrated and

33:34.280 --> 33:40.551
packaged for consumption.

33:40.552 --> 33:43.421
Abigail Mendosa and her sister

33:43.422 --> 33:45.323
are Zapotec, original people

33:45.324 --> 33:48.993
from Mexico before the
Spanish, before the Aztecs.

33:48.994 --> 33:52.297
This is her restaurant, where

33:52.298 --> 33:55.966
Abigail has been grinding corn

33:55.967 --> 33:57.602
by hand, making food like this,

33:57.603 --> 34:00.438
the ridiculously faithful,

34:00.439 --> 34:01.273
time-consuming traditional way

34:01.274 --> 34:06.244
she was taught to make these

34:06.245 --> 34:06.845
things and the way she's been

34:06.846 --> 34:10.148
making them since she
was 6 years old.

34:10.149 --> 34:13.650
Look at her hands, by the way.

34:13.652 --> 34:15.286
Small, surprisingly delicate,

34:15.286 --> 34:17.788
given all the hard work, all the

34:17.789 --> 34:19.157
pushing, kneading, grinding,

34:19.158 --> 34:21.792
stone against stone
over the years.

34:21.793 --> 34:23.594
Then look at her forearms.

34:23.594 --> 34:24.295
The power there.

34:24.297 --> 34:32.297
It's impressive and beautiful.

34:33.438 --> 34:35.639
Every time you enter the

34:35.641 --> 34:37.507
house, in wahawka, especially in

34:37.509 --> 34:41.512
the small villages, they always

34:41.513 --> 34:42.980
offer you a shot of mescal.

34:42.981 --> 34:48.853
Mm, so good.

34:48.853 --> 34:50.987
A molee and chicken dish, this

34:50.989 --> 34:52.889
sauce like a lot of the old

34:52.891 --> 34:55.659
school sauces made by masters

34:55.661 --> 34:57.128
like Abigail use 35 different

34:57.129 --> 34:58.396
types of chili peppers and take

34:58.397 --> 35:03.301
more than two weeks to make.

35:03.302 --> 35:06.904
Do you think that until
recently, until guys like you,

35:06.905 --> 35:09.340
that Mexicans were not looking

35:09.341 --> 35:11.309
back at their own food culture,

35:11.310 --> 35:12.643
they were looking elsewhere?

35:12.644 --> 35:14.379
What was going on?

35:14.380 --> 35:16.547
We were conquerers.

35:16.548 --> 35:18.749
We are were also a culture that

35:18.750 --> 35:20.885
was conquered first by the

35:20.886 --> 35:23.688
Aztecs and then conquered by the

35:23.689 --> 35:24.590
Spaniards so we were always

35:24.591 --> 35:27.192
taught everything that was
good and excellent has to be

35:27.193 --> 35:27.459
imported.

35:27.459 --> 35:28.327
Right.

35:28.328 --> 35:29.727
What we have here, it
was just not good.

35:29.728 --> 35:33.063
Right.

35:33.064 --> 35:37.368
Another zapotecan classic, chili

35:37.369 --> 35:39.204
agua, a simpler dish of cow and

35:39.205 --> 35:41.172
pork brains cooked with chili,

35:41.173 --> 35:43.874
tomatoes and yorba Santa.

35:43.875 --> 35:45.576
As a cook, the main thing

35:45.577 --> 35:48.946
was to develop a little
bit my cuisine here.

35:48.947 --> 35:54.752
There was this space where
nobody tried to innovate.

35:54.753 --> 35:57.087
Still using the same techniques,

35:57.088 --> 35:58.623
the same ingredient, the same

35:58.624 --> 36:04.362
flavors, herbs, et cetera, but

36:04.363 --> 36:11.436
developing them a little bit.

36:11.437 --> 36:16.307
I mean, that's as
old-school as it gets.

36:16.308 --> 36:19.777
A final dish, this one, this

36:19.778 --> 36:27.778
is something that you do not
find anywhere as Mexico.

36:32.958 --> 36:35.793
The quoi yet night.

36:35.794 --> 36:43.794
The central square of Wahaka.

36:47.072 --> 36:48.606
But even tonight there's plenty

36:48.607 --> 36:51.609
of evidence of the struggle, the

36:51.610 --> 36:59.584
discontent boiling just
under the surface.

36:59.585 --> 37:01.786
The graffiti and painting of

37:01.787 --> 37:09.787
this street artist captures
that spirit of protest.

37:10.629 --> 37:13.298
♪

37:13.299 --> 37:16.367
Tie last supper, for sure.

37:16.368 --> 37:18.936
Last supper by Mexican.

37:18.937 --> 37:20.538
Who are these people?

37:20.539 --> 37:24.008
These are most powerful
people in Mexico.

37:24.009 --> 37:27.445
People that is driving Mexico.

37:27.446 --> 37:29.847
This is the president right now.

37:29.848 --> 37:30.616
This is Calderon.

37:30.616 --> 37:31.016
Right.

37:31.017 --> 37:32.017
The last president.

37:32.017 --> 37:32.718
The last president.

37:32.719 --> 37:35.152
That guy is like
the economy guy.

37:35.153 --> 37:35.454
Right.

37:35.455 --> 37:39.524
Who's moving the
economy in Mexico.

37:39.525 --> 37:42.960
And this is the army.

37:42.961 --> 37:44.795
This is a prostitute.

37:44.796 --> 37:48.132
This represent because
they are like prostitutes.

37:48.133 --> 37:49.800
Right.

37:49.801 --> 37:50.968
You know?

37:50.969 --> 37:52.703
And narco traffic.

37:52.704 --> 37:52.938
Oh.

37:52.939 --> 37:55.573
He is like the god in Mexico.

37:55.574 --> 37:56.207
You know?

37:56.208 --> 38:00.144
Because he is, like,
over... all of it.

38:00.145 --> 38:00.479
Yeah.

38:00.480 --> 38:02.647
So this is the way Mexico works?

38:02.648 --> 38:03.148
Yeah.

38:03.149 --> 38:09.654
For me, the most problem in
Mexico is the corruption.

38:09.655 --> 38:14.392
Mexico can be a dangerous
place for journalists, for

38:14.393 --> 38:15.327
politicians, for police.

38:15.328 --> 38:18.028
Is it a dangerous
place for artists in.

38:18.029 --> 38:18.263
Yeah.

38:18.264 --> 38:20.898
I think so a little bit because

38:20.899 --> 38:22.900
you do not agree with the

38:22.901 --> 38:23.569
government, you are like enemy.

38:23.570 --> 38:27.373
Right.

38:42.253 --> 38:45.956
In 1936, the town 50 miles

38:45.957 --> 38:50.595
from Mexico City was
visited by Malcolm Lowry.

38:50.596 --> 38:54.799
The tormented self loathing
brilliant and hopelessly

38:54.800 --> 38:56.233
alcoholic author.

38:56.234 --> 39:00.471
His life work under the
volcano was set here.

39:00.472 --> 39:02.272
It is widely believed to be one

39:02.273 --> 39:06.243
of the great novels
of the 20th century.

39:06.244 --> 39:10.815
Lowry saw symbolism and
evil everywhere here.

39:10.816 --> 39:15.553
In the deep areas, the looming

39:15.554 --> 39:23.554
volcano that towered overhead.

39:25.330 --> 39:30.267
Writer, poet, Javier Cecilia,

39:30.268 --> 39:34.071
has reason to see evil, too.

39:34.072 --> 39:38.275
On march 28th, 2011, narcos

39:38.276 --> 39:42.079
kidnapped and murdered his son

39:42.080 --> 39:46.417
and six other equally
blameless victims.

39:46.418 --> 39:47.518
Cecilia found himself to march

39:47.519 --> 39:49.253
to Mexico City to demand an end

39:49.254 --> 39:51.456
to the increasingly futile

39:51.457 --> 39:54.091
so-called war on drugs that was

39:54.092 --> 39:58.328
mindlessly grinding up so many

39:58.329 --> 40:06.329
victims in the crossfire
and in the margins.

40:17.282 --> 40:21.118
In "Under the volcano," the evil

40:21.119 --> 40:26.290
that's coming is
fascism, Naziism.

40:26.291 --> 40:32.430
When's the heart of the
infernal machine today?

40:47.345 --> 40:48.713
What does he want to say?

40:48.714 --> 40:52.718
What does he want
people to hear?

41:12.504 --> 41:14.939
Can he think of one place on

41:14.940 --> 41:16.674
earth where the good guys are

41:16.675 --> 41:18.576
winning and where you are not

41:18.577 --> 41:26.577
ground under the
wheels of the machine?

41:54.646 --> 42:02.646
Have you written a poem since
the death of your son?

42:15.901 --> 42:23.240
As I have come to know in my
own life, drugs, even drug

42:23.241 --> 42:26.476
addiction, can be a
survivable event.

42:26.477 --> 42:27.912
Death is not.

42:27.913 --> 42:32.283
Death is final.
