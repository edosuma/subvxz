01:39.405 --> 01:41.407
It shouldn't be here.

03:04.789 --> 03:06.374
Moving on to...

03:13.130 --> 03:16.092
Wolf 336, F-class star...

03:16.175 --> 03:19.680
at right ascension 7.36.7.

03:19.763 --> 03:24.726
5.21 declination.

03:26.853 --> 03:28.772
I thought that was the last one.

03:28.855 --> 03:30.108
Why'd you think that?

03:30.191 --> 03:32.652
You said that it would be.

03:32.735 --> 03:35.071
No, I distinctly remember
forgetting that.

03:35.154 --> 03:37.448
I don't know why
I put up with this.

03:37.532 --> 03:40.410
Yes, I do.
Because I let you drive.

03:40.451 --> 03:42.537
I'm a ride-share hostage.

03:42.620 --> 03:45.374
F-class star.
Recent variability.

03:45.416 --> 03:47.918
14.6 light-years away.

03:49.003 --> 03:50.921
This is nuts anyway.
The whole approach.

03:51.005 --> 03:53.173
SETI's tough enough
on microwave band.

03:53.257 --> 03:55.009
Now you want to search FM?

03:55.092 --> 03:56.678
With all that noise?

03:56.761 --> 03:59.139
Might as well look for a needle
in a haystack...

03:59.222 --> 04:01.141
of needles.

04:06.187 --> 04:07.731
Station Five.

04:07.772 --> 04:10.067
Is my voice even vaguely familiar
to you, Zane?

04:10.151 --> 04:14.030
Honey, I'm trying to get out of here,
but as usual, Calvin's holding me up.

04:14.113 --> 04:16.031
Should be home by 1:00, 1:30.

04:16.115 --> 04:19.368
1:30, Tuesday? Wednesday?
A.M.? P.M.?

04:19.452 --> 04:22.956
What can I say?
I'm a ride-share hostage.

04:23.040 --> 04:25.834
I'm going to go pee.

04:25.917 --> 04:28.086
I will try to...

04:29.671 --> 04:31.340
Where are you?

04:31.423 --> 04:32.758
I'm having a drink with Becky.

04:32.799 --> 04:35.470
You're in some bar,
while I'm here working?

04:35.553 --> 04:38.473
There's a cute hockey player here too.
But he's only in town for one night.

04:38.514 --> 04:41.934
All right. I give up.
What do you want?

04:41.976 --> 04:43.644
I want your ass in bed, Zane.

04:45.063 --> 04:47.982
Okay. I'll leave now...

04:48.066 --> 04:49.651
if you leave now.

04:49.735 --> 04:53.238
But do not talk to
any strangers on the way out.

04:53.322 --> 04:55.574
I'll see you at my place
in 83 minutes, okay?

04:55.657 --> 04:58.786
Swear you'll be there?
I don't want a repeat of last week.

04:58.869 --> 05:01.998
If I say I'm going to be there, I will.
End of story.

05:02.082 --> 05:04.167
There is nothing more important to me
right now than our...

05:04.167 --> 05:05.418
There is nothing more important to me
right now than our...

05:17.973 --> 05:20.351
Good solid spike.

05:20.434 --> 05:22.353
Nice symmetry to the modulation.

05:22.436 --> 05:24.438
Detection protocol. Now!

05:29.861 --> 05:32.989
- Confirmation Phase One.
- Swing dish five degrees off axis.

05:37.869 --> 05:40.122
And signal fades. Looking good.

05:40.205 --> 05:43.001
Now swing dish back on target.

05:45.545 --> 05:50.883
Signal returns. Definitely sky based.
Wolf 336, you are howling.

05:51.968 --> 05:53.177
Phase Two!

05:54.263 --> 05:56.473
Initiating software check.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.726
Jumping ahead to Phase Three:
second source verification.

06:00.728 --> 06:04.773
Who's still on line?
Green Bank? Ohio State? Moffet Field!

06:04.857 --> 06:06.568
Checking. Still checking.

06:06.651 --> 06:09.571
Be there. Just be there.
We got to get another ear on this.

06:09.654 --> 06:13.074
Software self-checks.
Phase Two complete.

06:13.116 --> 06:15.785
Come on, Moffet.
You're killing me. I'm dying here!

06:15.869 --> 06:18.788
Just pick up the phone
so we can confirm this.

06:36.016 --> 06:37.267
Nothing.

06:47.945 --> 06:49.030
Zaminsky!

06:52.784 --> 06:55.995
Zaminsky!
This is not valet parking!

06:56.079 --> 07:00.793
Stalled out on me.
Stalled on me! This piece of...

07:00.876 --> 07:02.419
Sorry, sir.

07:02.503 --> 07:04.088
Sorry.

07:11.930 --> 07:15.475
That's it?
Forty-two seconds.

07:16.434 --> 07:17.686
We listened all night.

07:17.769 --> 07:19.896
All night, all morning,
and the sound never repeated.

07:19.979 --> 07:23.900
It's 42 seconds of nonrandom,
non-Earth-based signal!

07:23.983 --> 07:25.903
This could be it, Gordy.

07:25.986 --> 07:28.280
Sounds compressed,
like a military burst communication.

07:28.364 --> 07:31.033
No way. No way.
Not at 107 megahertz.

07:31.117 --> 07:35.413
107? What the hell are you doing
so far below the microwave?

07:35.496 --> 07:36.914
Good question.

07:36.997 --> 07:41.545
So this is a variable star,
this Wolf 336?

07:41.628 --> 07:44.381
14.6 light-years away.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.925
All right. Okay.

07:47.009 --> 07:49.970
So if it is a variable,
it expands and contracts dramatically.

07:50.053 --> 07:52.015
So, gentlemen,
maybe you can explain to me...

07:52.098 --> 07:55.685
how intelligent life can actually
develop in such a volatile environment.

07:55.768 --> 07:58.229
It's only been unstable for what?

07:58.312 --> 07:59.731
Fifty years or so.

07:59.814 --> 08:02.692
Which means it's possible some form
of life could still exist there.

08:02.734 --> 08:03.819
Exactly.

08:03.902 --> 08:06.405
Maybe this is a distress call.

08:06.488 --> 08:08.282
An S.O.S.

08:08.365 --> 08:11.452
Maybe they're sending out
their Encyclopedia Gallactica...

08:11.535 --> 08:14.663
jettisoning all their knowledge
before it goes down with the ship.

08:16.373 --> 08:20.462
It lasted 42 seconds,
and it never repeated.

08:22.213 --> 08:26.509
That's why we have to stay on this one,
Gordy, in case it does.

08:26.551 --> 08:29.471
I'll pull double shifts.
I'll pull triple shifts if I have to.

08:29.555 --> 08:33.100
But I want priority status
and dish time. Serious dish time.

08:33.183 --> 08:36.145
During normal business hours,
preferably.

08:39.315 --> 08:43.486
Calvin, why don't you go home,
get some sleep, okay?

08:43.570 --> 08:44.905
Go ahead.

08:58.419 --> 09:01.547
It's a mandatory 20% cutback.

09:01.631 --> 09:04.675
Tracking station has a fixed
operating cost. I can't touch that.

09:04.759 --> 09:08.137
- I've got to look at personnel.
- Are you even shitting me?

09:08.221 --> 09:13.727
I can swing a month's pay,
instead of two weeks.

09:13.811 --> 09:18.065
Maybe extend the health benefits
two weeks beyond that, but...

09:19.692 --> 09:21.736
Let me see if I got this straight.

09:21.820 --> 09:23.780
I come to you...

09:23.822 --> 09:25.990
I come to you with what may be...

09:26.074 --> 09:28.410
the preeminent discovery
of the 20th Century:

09:28.493 --> 09:30.787
the possibility of extra-solar life.

09:30.870 --> 09:32.789
And I get shitcanned for it?

09:35.501 --> 09:37.586
I know how important this is.

09:39.588 --> 09:42.299
But searching for E.T. s
in this political environment...

09:42.383 --> 09:44.301
is a tough sell on Capitol Hill.

09:44.385 --> 09:48.306
If we don't start spending money on
harder science, we're going to lose it.

09:49.808 --> 09:53.228
Let's forget about me for a second.
What about the signal?

09:54.980 --> 09:56.982
I'm skeptical.

09:57.065 --> 10:00.610
But it is interesting.

10:02.030 --> 10:03.990
I'll pass it along to decoding.

10:04.032 --> 10:06.659
See if there's
a pattern recognition there, but...

10:08.161 --> 10:10.204
I don't have to tell you.
You know the rule.

10:10.288 --> 10:12.874
- If you can't confirm it...
- Then it doesn't exist.

10:12.957 --> 10:16.253
What asshole made up that rule?
Can we fire him instead?

10:17.171 --> 10:19.131
It doesn't please me...

10:19.173 --> 10:22.509
to be losing
the brightest and the best.

10:22.593 --> 10:25.679
I wish there was another way.
I honestly do.

10:45.117 --> 10:47.495
Well, it is finally cooling off
in the Southland...

10:47.536 --> 10:49.663
after a day of
near-record temperatures.

10:49.747 --> 10:53.835
But hot again tomorrow and
hot again on Thursday with no letup...

10:57.047 --> 10:59.800
How are you doing for money?
If you need me to, I could...

10:59.883 --> 11:02.511
No. There's a SETI program up north.

11:02.594 --> 11:05.013
Guy who runs it, Bill Wyatt,
was begging me to come up.

11:05.055 --> 11:06.516
Might call him.

11:06.557 --> 11:09.227
You're not really thinking
about going back to it, are you?

11:09.310 --> 11:12.230
We had a bell ringer this morning.
Really good signal.

11:12.313 --> 11:16.234
I just couldn't confirm it in time.

11:16.275 --> 11:18.319
You had something
really good last year too.

11:18.403 --> 11:21.490
Turned out to be what?
A broken microwave oven.

11:21.573 --> 11:25.494
What's your point? There's always
something to give me false hope?

11:25.577 --> 11:28.330
- That I'm wasting my life?
- I didn't say that.

11:28.414 --> 11:31.125
But, you know,
it's interesting that you did.

11:37.507 --> 11:40.260
Come on.
Someone is watching.

11:47.601 --> 11:48.728
What?

11:50.271 --> 11:53.399
How in the hell did I wind up
with somebody like you?

11:53.441 --> 11:55.443
I got tired of rich guys
with good futures.

11:55.526 --> 11:58.321
No. Really.
What is it you see in me?

11:58.405 --> 12:00.907
What made you call me
the first time?

12:00.991 --> 12:04.327
Boy, when their self-worth goes...

12:05.454 --> 12:08.290
Okay, I see a man
of great intelligence...

12:08.373 --> 12:12.712
dedication,
cute little kind of insecurity.

12:12.795 --> 12:15.006
- A little paranoia...
- This went to shit fast.

12:17.842 --> 12:22.263
Why do we always have to analyze
everything? Can't you trust I love you?

12:22.305 --> 12:25.976
Algorithms I trust.
Boolean logic I trust.

12:26.060 --> 12:29.146
Beautiful women,
they just mystify me.

12:29.229 --> 12:33.650
Two years and we're still talking
about trust? It's amazing.

12:33.734 --> 12:35.819
I should shut the hell up, huh?

12:37.655 --> 12:41.576
Look, it's your career.
I will support any decision you make.

12:41.659 --> 12:44.746
But if we are going to make it...

12:44.829 --> 12:48.124
we've got to take care
of our problems here on planet Earth.

12:48.208 --> 12:52.922
That is just a little hard when
you're always off looking at the stars.

12:54.298 --> 12:55.883
Listening.

12:57.802 --> 12:59.762
Listening.

13:01.389 --> 13:04.226
Are we falling apart here?
Is that it, Char?

13:04.309 --> 13:06.436
I don't know, Zane.

13:07.521 --> 13:10.065
Are we?

13:10.148 --> 13:10.190
How'd you do on the test?

13:10.190 --> 13:13.819
How'd you do on the test?

13:13.902 --> 13:18.908
No, I'm saying it's incomplete.
There's no chemical breakdown.

13:18.991 --> 13:21.828
There's no broadband chart analysis.
Want me to go on?

13:21.911 --> 13:24.122
That information
isn't available at this time.

13:24.205 --> 13:27.625
This information was promised me
two months ago.

13:27.709 --> 13:29.628
These are not national secrets.

13:29.712 --> 13:32.840
This is a routine analysis
of the atmosphere. Why should I...

13:32.923 --> 13:36.135
There's a problem with that satellite.
It's blind to certain trace gases.

13:36.218 --> 13:37.803
Really? As of when?

13:37.886 --> 13:42.517
It lost a solar panel. Some functions
were shut down to save energy.

13:42.559 --> 13:45.478
Look, here's my problem.

13:45.562 --> 13:49.023
I've devoted my sabbatical
to greenhouse trace gases.

13:49.107 --> 13:52.610
If I don't get this data, I might as
well be counting cow farts in Montana.

13:52.694 --> 13:56.282
You'll have to wait until
the new satellite is in place.

13:56.365 --> 14:00.745
- When's the launch date?
- NASA doesn't have that information.

14:00.828 --> 14:04.915
Round and round we go.
Thanks for naught.

14:21.434 --> 14:23.061
Moffet Field.

14:23.102 --> 14:25.188
Bill Wyatt, Zane Zaminsky.
How are you, man?

14:25.271 --> 14:27.482
Oh, yeah, Zane. Hi.

14:27.565 --> 14:30.401
I know you said you'd get back to me,
but I felt obligated...

14:30.443 --> 14:32.570
to let you know about a job offer
that came up.

14:32.653 --> 14:35.199
Telecommunications.
Looks pretty sweet too.

14:35.282 --> 14:37.201
The health plan alone, you know.

14:37.284 --> 14:39.703
Well, good.
You should take it, Zane.

14:39.787 --> 14:42.706
I don't think things
are going to work out here.

14:42.790 --> 14:48.088
But I thought you were
looking for radio astronomers?

14:48.171 --> 14:52.008
Some good creative thinkers?
Isn't that what you said?

14:52.092 --> 14:56.721
Creative's one thing.
Too creative's another.

14:56.805 --> 14:58.723
I'm not tracking.

14:58.807 --> 15:00.726
I'm not sure
I should be saying this.

15:00.810 --> 15:03.771
I talked to Phil Gordian at J.P.L.

15:03.854 --> 15:07.566
- The indication was...
- Just say it.

15:07.650 --> 15:12.488
He said you were faking signals
in order to keep your job.

15:16.326 --> 15:19.788
I do believe
this permit's expired.

15:19.871 --> 15:21.832
Why haven't you?

15:32.969 --> 15:33.010
To raise the temperature
of the planet tenfold...

15:33.010 --> 15:37.598
To raise the temperature
of the planet tenfold...

15:37.682 --> 15:42.855
to change the atmosphere
into one suitable to colonization...

15:42.938 --> 15:46.400
to construct farms and cities...

15:46.483 --> 15:52.323
and build an infrastructure capable
of supporting thousands of colonists.

15:52.407 --> 15:53.950
Make no mistake.

15:54.033 --> 15:57.454
Never before have we
undertaken a task...

16:00.874 --> 16:04.252
Have we undertaken
a task of this size.

16:04.335 --> 16:07.757
- The terraforming of Mars.
- Do you know who Phil Gordian is?

16:07.840 --> 16:11.427
The key to all of this
is polar ice.

16:11.510 --> 16:14.346
Enough heat-generating factories
could be built.

16:14.388 --> 16:16.891
The heat would be enough to melt...

16:18.268 --> 16:22.230
Excuse me. But perhaps you'd care
to use the microphone?

16:22.314 --> 16:24.274
Yes. Yes, I would.

16:27.235 --> 16:28.320
Thanks.

16:29.571 --> 16:32.325
Phil Gordian?
Has anybody seen him?

16:32.408 --> 16:35.203
I'm looking for Phil Gordian.

16:35.286 --> 16:37.371
Anybody seen Phil Gordian?

16:37.413 --> 16:40.208
The man was in the middle
of a seminar, Zane.

16:40.291 --> 16:43.586
Why don't we step outside?
Let him finish.

16:43.669 --> 16:47.424
Did you even give it to decoding?
Did you even see what was there?

16:48.634 --> 16:50.594
Why don't we take this outside?

16:50.636 --> 16:53.305
If you're not going to analyze it,
I want my tape back.

16:53.389 --> 16:58.019
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're referring to.

17:03.525 --> 17:06.277
Why don't you show me how smart you are
by leaving right now?

17:06.361 --> 17:08.695
What's going on, huh?
What are you doing this for?

17:08.780 --> 17:11.450
- Back it up. Let's go.
- Why are you telling them lies about me?

17:11.534 --> 17:13.702
- I said, now! Let's go!
- Why?

17:13.786 --> 17:16.163
- Come on. Let's go.
- Why?

17:16.247 --> 17:21.585
I'm sorry. He's a troubled young man.
A very troubled young man.

17:21.627 --> 17:24.673
My apologies. Please. Continue.

17:27.384 --> 17:31.138
Where was I? Polar ice.

17:32.639 --> 17:35.267
After the polar ice has been melted...

17:35.350 --> 17:38.438
the atmosphere begins to grow thicker.

17:38.521 --> 17:43.568
Finally, a kind of
critical mass is reached.

17:43.651 --> 17:48.197
At this point, the atmosphere
begins to work for us.

17:58.167 --> 18:00.669
- Station Five.
- Tell me I'm not losing my mind.

18:00.711 --> 18:03.256
- Just tell me.
- Zane, where are you?

18:03.339 --> 18:05.258
They're acting like it never happened.
I saw Gordian.

18:05.341 --> 18:07.260
It's like we never gave him any tape.

18:07.343 --> 18:09.512
- Listen, Zane...
- But then I remembered.

18:09.596 --> 18:12.307
It should be on the backup DAT system.
We should have a copy of the signal.

18:12.390 --> 18:15.436
Well, yes and no.

18:15.519 --> 18:18.481
There are some D.O.D. guys here...

18:18.564 --> 18:20.608
going through our stuff as we speak.

18:20.691 --> 18:23.527
Apparently, it was a burst
from a spy satellite.

18:23.611 --> 18:26.822
- What?
- It's a defense thing.

18:26.906 --> 18:30.077
Which is probably why
Gordian couldn't tell us about it.

18:30.160 --> 18:32.412
We weren't cleared
for this spy shit.

18:32.496 --> 18:35.624
Cal, listen to me very carefully.

18:35.707 --> 18:38.335
Satellites do not move
like stars move.

18:38.418 --> 18:41.464
We tracked this thing in stereo time,
in star time, okay?

18:41.547 --> 18:45.551
I don't know who these guys are,
but I do know they're lying to you.

18:49.097 --> 18:51.057
Is this everything?

18:51.933 --> 18:54.937
If you haven't told them
about the backup system, don't!

18:55.020 --> 18:56.480
We have it all?

18:56.563 --> 18:59.650
Don't you tell them, Cal!
Don't you dare!

19:03.737 --> 19:05.030
There...

19:05.114 --> 19:07.784
There's a backup system.

19:24.135 --> 19:25.803
Hey.

19:27.930 --> 19:32.852
So if this was a spy bird,
why was it moving like a star?

19:37.190 --> 19:42.404
Not really sure.
We'll have to get back to you on that.

19:59.088 --> 19:59.130
It's a very aggressive company.
With the federal mandate for air bags...

19:59.130 --> 20:02.217
It's a very aggressive company.
With the federal mandate for air bags...

20:02.301 --> 20:05.512
they are perfectly positioned
to dominate the market for years.

20:05.596 --> 20:07.765
Blade Co. Technologies.

20:07.848 --> 20:11.435
All right. I'll send you a prospectus.
Are you at the same address?

20:12.729 --> 20:15.899
Doug, can I call
you back in, say, ten minutes?

20:15.982 --> 20:17.984
- So I get this signal.
- How about 5:00?

20:18.068 --> 20:19.277
- Signal from an F-class.
- 5:15.

20:19.360 --> 20:20.779
Like our sun but hotter.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.615
- First they act like it's nothing.
- Great. Thanks.

20:23.656 --> 20:26.827
Now they're going to unimaginable pains
to make it disappear.

20:26.911 --> 20:28.704
I thought you had a new job.

20:28.788 --> 20:31.248
Something is going on here, Char.

20:31.332 --> 20:34.001
Why the hell would they do that?
What is it they're trying to hide?

20:34.085 --> 20:35.294
Maybe we could talk later.

20:35.377 --> 20:38.130
I need to talk about this now!

20:48.850 --> 20:51.813
- I called last night twice.
- I got the messages.

20:51.896 --> 20:53.898
I thought the problem was
I wasn't around enough.

20:53.981 --> 20:56.609
Now that I am, you're not.
What is this, Tales From The Dark Side?

20:56.692 --> 20:59.445
I have been avoiding this. Yes.

21:00.530 --> 21:03.866
Okay. Define "this."

21:03.950 --> 21:09.498
The brokerage is strongly suggesting
I head up the office in San Diego soon.

21:09.581 --> 21:14.044
- It'd mean moving there.
- Can you tell them no?

21:14.128 --> 21:17.674
Thank you. I tell you I'll support
any career decision you make.

21:17.715 --> 21:20.135
- But when it comes to my work...
- You're considering this?

21:20.218 --> 21:23.138
Char, it's Mr. Morgan on line five.

21:25.390 --> 21:26.850
And?

21:30.019 --> 21:31.272
I got to take this.

21:31.355 --> 21:33.315
By any chance is he
going to San Diego also?

21:33.399 --> 21:36.235
Why don't you stick your paranoia
back in your pants and get out of here?

21:36.318 --> 21:38.529
- I will call you.
- Fine. No problem.

21:38.571 --> 21:40.531
- When?
- Whenever I get to it.

21:40.573 --> 21:42.450
"Tuesday? Wednesday? A.M.? P.M.?"

21:42.533 --> 21:43.869
Go!

21:56.173 --> 21:57.425
Right now.

21:57.508 --> 22:01.429
They could be talking to us
right now.

22:44.642 --> 22:46.769
An array.

22:46.852 --> 22:48.814
Phased array.

23:00.617 --> 23:04.038
Good morning, Mr. Carbiner. I'm Horace
with your local satellite company.

23:06.207 --> 23:08.167
Good morning.

23:12.672 --> 23:13.548
Can I see your dish?

23:22.933 --> 23:24.435
What a glorious morning.
Hot enough for you?

23:35.447 --> 23:38.324
For a limited time, we're offering
a free upgrade on a totally automated...

23:38.408 --> 23:40.160
fiber-optic control system.

23:40.243 --> 23:43.038
All this at no extra cost to you.
No extra cost to you.

23:44.540 --> 23:49.044
One of the many ways we're improving
the quality of service to our customers.

23:49.128 --> 23:50.379
Can I see your dish?

24:53.697 --> 24:55.449
Jesus!

25:03.125 --> 25:05.377
What are you doing here?
And how soon can you leave?

25:05.460 --> 25:07.712
- What are you doing here?
- I live here. Do you mind?

25:07.796 --> 25:09.714
I mind you grabbing on me.
Let go!

25:09.798 --> 25:13.845
- I'm trying to help you down.
- I can do it myself!

25:13.928 --> 25:16.764
- My butt is stuck.
- You live next door.

25:16.848 --> 25:18.182
With Mrs. Roosevelt.
That it?

25:18.266 --> 25:21.227
I live in L.A.
Just kicking it here a minute.

25:21.310 --> 25:23.438
I don't want anybody
nosing around here.

25:23.521 --> 25:26.066
If I were going to steal your stuff,
it would be over and done.

25:26.150 --> 25:28.527
What do you know about my stuff?

25:28.610 --> 25:30.737
What are you doing climbing roofs
at 1:00 in the morning?

25:30.821 --> 25:33.240
Shouldn't you be out
tagging freeway signs?

25:33.323 --> 25:35.242
I don't got to tell you shit.

25:36.285 --> 25:39.247
Fine. Hang there all night.

25:39.330 --> 25:41.708
Hey! Where you going?
Get me down.

25:55.681 --> 25:58.851
What are you doing?
I told you to wait downstairs.

25:58.934 --> 26:00.519
What's this?

26:00.603 --> 26:03.481
It's a cooling jacket
for a low-noise amp. Don't touch it.

26:03.522 --> 26:05.484
What's that blinky shit over there?

26:05.525 --> 26:09.070
Will you just sit down?
Put this on your ankle.

26:09.154 --> 26:11.364
I don't want that thing.
It's cold.

26:11.448 --> 26:13.867
Just keep your butt down...

26:13.950 --> 26:17.789
your foot up and your mouth shut.

26:17.872 --> 26:20.958
You can watch,
but don't touch anything.

26:48.655 --> 26:50.031
What are them dots?

26:53.243 --> 26:55.829
They're satellite dishes.
Each one.

26:57.915 --> 27:02.253
You string enough of them together,
it makes one big radio antennae.

27:02.336 --> 27:03.629
What's it do?

27:06.257 --> 27:08.759
It lets you get close
to the stars.

27:18.103 --> 27:20.897
See if you get 92.9, K-BUMP.

27:24.819 --> 27:29.532
Greetings from beyond
the solar system.

27:29.615 --> 27:33.077
- That, my friend, is Voyager 2.
- What's that?

27:33.161 --> 27:35.539
Voyager is a planetary probe
launched in the mid-'70s.

27:35.622 --> 27:37.541
They don't teach science
in school anymore?

27:37.624 --> 27:40.419
Too busy patting us down
to see if we're strapped.

27:40.502 --> 27:43.755
I assume you mean guns.
They find one on you?

27:43.839 --> 27:45.924
Not me. Just everyone else.

27:46.008 --> 27:49.095
That's how come the folks want me
out of L.A. Crazy stuff going on.

27:53.767 --> 27:56.019
Can I come in now?

28:00.440 --> 28:05.029
So, this is the star, Wolf 336.

28:05.112 --> 28:08.032
We check the spectra
at different magnifications...

28:08.115 --> 28:10.242
looking for anything unusual.

28:13.120 --> 28:18.543
But, unfortunately, all we find is the
typical radio noise of an F-class star.

28:18.627 --> 28:22.714
But you talked to them before, huh?
The aliens? This channel?

28:22.798 --> 28:24.716
This star, this frequency.

28:24.800 --> 28:29.347
But we can't really talk. It takes years
for a radio wave to get here.

28:29.430 --> 28:32.391
So all we can really do is
just listen.

28:35.394 --> 28:38.397
But what'd they say? Before.

28:38.481 --> 28:40.442
Maybe how to live forever.

28:40.526 --> 28:43.570
Maybe how to make
nuclear power safe.

28:43.654 --> 28:46.323
I don't know. Maybe they were
just ordering out for a pizza.

28:46.406 --> 28:48.826
We won't really know
what they're saying.

28:48.909 --> 28:51.370
Not at first. But that doesn't
make it less important.

28:51.411 --> 28:55.375
If I can confirm this signal,
if we can find it again...

28:55.416 --> 28:59.796
then we will finally, finally know
that we're not alone.

28:59.879 --> 29:02.799
I wonder what
they're going to look like.

29:21.236 --> 29:24.990
Warning: Your sleep period is over.

29:25.073 --> 29:27.409
Get out of bed.

29:54.563 --> 29:57.316
- Jesus!
- You going to try again? Tonight?

29:57.399 --> 30:01.196
If you are, I could wait up
and help some this time.

30:01.279 --> 30:03.281
Didn't tell anybody
about our little clubhouse, did you?

30:04.657 --> 30:05.992
What am I? New?

30:06.075 --> 30:09.078
What about your grandma?
She doesn't care if you stay up late?

30:09.162 --> 30:12.208
- Not after 10:00.
- What happens at 10:00?

30:12.291 --> 30:13.918
She passes out on cough syrup.

30:17.588 --> 30:20.549
Tell you what, whenever I'm up there,
you can come over.

30:20.633 --> 30:23.636
But only, only
if you got the proper I.D.

30:23.677 --> 30:25.263
Where I get that?

30:39.278 --> 30:43.491
What about me, huh?
When can I do something?

30:43.574 --> 30:45.785
Okay. Hit that key.

30:45.868 --> 30:47.620
- What one?
- That one.

30:47.662 --> 30:49.288
- This one here?
- Yes.

30:49.372 --> 30:51.792
- Are you sure it's okay?
- I'm sure it's okay.

30:51.834 --> 30:53.877
- This one right under my finger?
- Give me your badge. You're fired.

30:53.961 --> 30:56.463
I'll do it. I'll do it.

31:07.767 --> 31:12.313
- What's this signal going to look like?
- It's just a spike.

31:12.397 --> 31:17.278
A big one or a little one?
Because I got a big one.

31:38.842 --> 31:40.886
That's it.

31:40.969 --> 31:43.181
That's exactly
what Calvin and I saw.

32:01.617 --> 32:02.868
Come back!

32:09.042 --> 32:11.377
I didn't touch nothing, okay?

32:18.802 --> 32:22.431
That's the same thing.
Same signature, same periodicity.

32:22.515 --> 32:23.891
What the hell?

32:23.974 --> 32:27.061
- What is that lambada shit?
- It's got to be a bounce.

32:27.144 --> 32:30.815
Radio wave kicks off the inversion
layer, comes back in through the system.

32:30.898 --> 32:32.691
It's coming from Earth?

32:37.072 --> 32:39.991
Some Mexican radio station
on the same frequency tells us...

32:40.075 --> 32:42.410
where the bounce came from,
but it doesn't...

32:42.494 --> 32:45.455
But it's wack. All of it?

32:50.461 --> 32:51.712
Wait a second.

32:55.383 --> 32:59.387
The first signal was definitely
sky based. We verified it.

32:59.470 --> 33:02.975
But this one is Earth based.
Two identical signals.

33:03.058 --> 33:04.977
One comes from space,
the other from Earth.

33:05.060 --> 33:07.896
I'm all screwed up here.

33:07.980 --> 33:10.274
It doesn't make any sense.

33:14.028 --> 33:15.989
Unless they're talking.

33:16.030 --> 33:19.242
Last night you were telling me we
couldn't talk because it'd take years...

33:19.325 --> 33:21.786
Cal. I got to talk to Cal.

33:34.508 --> 33:38.179
I don't know. Somebody said
something about a faulty heater.

33:38.262 --> 33:40.432
- Carbon monoxide.
- Really?

33:46.354 --> 33:49.983
- Taking him to County.
- Yeah, sure, but this guy's D.O.A.

34:00.369 --> 34:03.331
What have we got here?

34:03.414 --> 34:06.919
Huge concentrations of trace gas
in Central Mexico, Ecuador, Brazil.

34:07.002 --> 34:10.255
Look. You can see for yourself.

34:10.339 --> 34:15.010
700% increase
over the last five years?

34:15.092 --> 34:17.221
- How can that be?
- My very question.

34:17.304 --> 34:20.391
How accurate is this data
you sent us, Ilana?

34:20.475 --> 34:23.393
It's hard to say. We cobbled it
together from ground stations...

34:23.478 --> 34:25.438
weather balloons,
Uncle Earl's aching corns.

34:25.522 --> 34:27.106
Some of your numbers are there.

34:27.190 --> 34:29.900
- No satellite data?
- NASA's bird has a bum wing.

34:29.984 --> 34:32.571
You've obviously
got some ratty data.

34:32.655 --> 34:34.572
We checked this as best we could.

34:35.533 --> 34:38.494
George, run me
a future cast, will you?

34:38.577 --> 34:41.413
Say, ten years,
assuming the same increase.

34:41.496 --> 34:42.915
Of course.

34:52.634 --> 34:55.303
This had better be wrong.

34:55.387 --> 34:59.350
According to this, we're looking at
an increase of 12 degrees Centigrade...

34:59.433 --> 35:01.978
over the next decade,
and that's just...

35:02.061 --> 35:04.105
- Catastrophic.
- I was going to say impossible.

35:04.188 --> 35:06.232
But, yes, that too.

35:16.535 --> 35:18.036
Central Mexico.

36:03.961 --> 36:06.964
- Excuse me.
- You come to see the ruins, my friend?

36:07.048 --> 36:08.966
I take you to some
much very good places.

36:10.510 --> 36:12.553
Let's just head for town.

36:14.347 --> 36:16.391
When does it start
to cool off down here?

36:16.475 --> 36:21.313
In San Marsol?
This is cool off.

36:26.276 --> 36:28.403
This dial right?

36:28.487 --> 36:31.449
Right, left. Both ways.

36:34.702 --> 36:38.164
This radio station?
You know where this is?

36:38.248 --> 36:40.875
Very far.
Not close to town.

36:40.959 --> 36:42.920
Let's go there.

36:43.003 --> 36:46.632
How about the ruins?
You want to see the ruins?

36:46.715 --> 36:50.886
The radio station. I need to go there.
I'm going to talk to the people.

37:16.914 --> 37:20.168
Accidente, he say.
But no persons was here...

37:21.879 --> 37:23.797
When the fire come last night.

37:23.881 --> 37:25.007
I'm too late.

37:28.135 --> 37:29.386
One day too late.

37:45.403 --> 37:47.323
Posada San Marsol.

37:47.406 --> 37:50.868
One of our much very best hotels.

38:07.010 --> 38:08.261
You see those?

38:09.638 --> 38:11.014
These TV dishes.

38:13.518 --> 38:15.937
- You know of any big ones?
- Big?

38:16.020 --> 38:18.481
Big. Not small like these,
but big.

38:18.564 --> 38:21.192
Fifty, sixty feet wide. Big.

39:46.534 --> 39:49.537
"One of our
very much best hotels."

39:50.580 --> 39:53.166
This is Peter Dowling
from Sierra Satellite.

39:53.249 --> 39:56.336
Just wondering if you were
sick or dead or something.

39:56.419 --> 39:59.757
'Cause if you're not, you're fired.
Sorry, pal.

40:02.426 --> 40:05.221
Yeah, Zane, this is Doug.

40:05.262 --> 40:09.391
I heard about you and Char.
I heard it was skidsville.

40:09.433 --> 40:12.062
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know what it feels like.

40:12.145 --> 40:15.649
If you want to get together anytime,
let's do it.

40:15.732 --> 40:18.276
We'll talk it through.
I'm there for ya, man, okay?

40:18.360 --> 40:21.947
And would you mind
if I got her number?

40:22.030 --> 40:25.535
I want to talk to her about
some investment possibilities.

40:25.618 --> 40:27.578
All right? Thanks.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.212
I called this morning.
Just didn't leave a message.

40:36.295 --> 40:37.965
Are you there?

40:38.048 --> 40:41.301
I guess I didn't get back
to you that night...

40:41.385 --> 40:44.388
because I was mad, Zane.

40:44.471 --> 40:49.727
I get so tired of being questioned
about even the basic things.

40:49.811 --> 40:54.899
I was feeling guilt too for steering you
away from what you should be doing...

40:54.983 --> 40:57.527
from what you love the most.

40:57.610 --> 41:02.449
But you were such an ass
the last time we talked.

41:02.491 --> 41:05.870
Damn. I can't remember
if this machine lets you ramble...

41:05.953 --> 41:08.664
so I better
just admit this quick.

41:08.747 --> 41:11.083
I miss your weird paranoid brain.

41:13.460 --> 41:16.006
Call when you can.

41:16.089 --> 41:18.216
Where are you, Zane?

42:42.765 --> 42:44.183
Move!

43:48.044 --> 43:50.004
So just who the hell are you, huh?

43:50.087 --> 43:52.007
Because I saw you in town.

43:52.966 --> 43:54.885
I saw you at the airport.

43:54.968 --> 43:56.970
You were waiting for me.

43:58.388 --> 44:00.307
You knew, didn't you?

44:16.533 --> 44:18.285
How the...

44:56.659 --> 44:58.912
Where do you hide a 20-meter dish?

46:00.186 --> 46:01.855
Research.

46:07.819 --> 46:10.322
- Jesus!
- Hey!

46:13.492 --> 46:17.163
Excuse me. Excuse me.
What's going on here?

46:17.247 --> 46:19.332
I don't know.
These guys are stealing my stuff.

46:19.415 --> 46:21.334
They're taking my equipment.
I was trying to work here.

46:22.126 --> 46:23.962
Excuse me. What?

46:27.257 --> 46:29.718
Take it easy.
Will you guys take it easy?

46:50.782 --> 46:53.285
I know I should say thanks.

46:53.368 --> 46:55.663
But that was a pretty dicey stunt
you pulled back there.

46:55.705 --> 46:57.707
You could have got us both shot.

46:57.748 --> 47:00.084
You're welcome,
and you're right.

47:00.167 --> 47:02.336
I saw you in town last night,
didn't I?

47:02.378 --> 47:04.797
Zane Zaminsky.
Am I still bleeding?

47:04.881 --> 47:06.799
A little. Ilana Green.

47:08.719 --> 47:10.804
Damn! It's hot in here.

47:10.888 --> 47:13.140
Think they'd have air-conditioning
in this place.

47:13.223 --> 47:15.392
I don't like blood.

47:17.477 --> 47:19.479
Why were they rousting you?

47:19.563 --> 47:22.150
Something about my gear
they don't like.

47:22.233 --> 47:24.819
- What is all that stuff?
- It's technical.

47:24.903 --> 47:29.240
It looks like some kind of radiosonde
for atmospheric sampling.

47:31.201 --> 47:32.660
That's right.

47:33.704 --> 47:35.789
That's absolutely right.

47:37.791 --> 47:39.793
Just who are you?

47:50.430 --> 47:52.432
Can I ask what I've done wrong?

47:52.516 --> 47:54.976
I wish to apologize to you both.

47:55.060 --> 47:57.437
We have overreacted in this matter.

47:57.521 --> 48:00.942
As for the equipment, it seems to be
ruined. If you give me a local number...

48:01.025 --> 48:05.404
Wait. Why was I detained?
Why did these men take my gear?

48:05.488 --> 48:08.491
- You were on private land.
- Isn't this a public facility?

48:08.574 --> 48:12.496
Please try to understand.
This is a new type of power station.

48:12.579 --> 48:16.416
With new technology come those
who would like to steal it.

48:16.500 --> 48:18.544
You're staying at San Marsol, yes?

48:18.627 --> 48:22.839
What do you mean, "new type"?
You still burn fossil fuels, right?

48:22.923 --> 48:26.386
With great efficiency,
very few emissions.

48:26.469 --> 48:30.890
- What kind of emissions?
- I'm not an expert in this matter.

48:30.974 --> 48:33.977
Perhaps if you were to leave me
a local number...

48:34.060 --> 48:37.063
- Perhaps if you give me...
- Call it a push. Come on.

48:40.734 --> 48:43.070
They say there's a twin
for everyone in the world.

48:43.153 --> 48:44.697
That's not it.

48:44.780 --> 48:47.825
Roll the genetic dice often enough,
they're gonna land on top of each other.

48:47.908 --> 48:51.036
Trust me, Ilana.
That is not it.

48:53.498 --> 48:56.668
Nice of them
to bring our cars here.

48:56.751 --> 49:00.881
Follow me back to town,
and don't make any stops, all right?

49:29.953 --> 49:33.082
I understand you do
residential work.

49:33.166 --> 49:37.629
I've got a little weeding problem
I'm hoping you can help me with.

49:37.670 --> 49:39.714
It's really a very small job.

49:40.423 --> 49:41.507
Here's the address.

52:27.478 --> 52:30.189
We saw Gulf hurricanes in March.

52:30.231 --> 52:34.027
Right now there's a drought
in the Sudan, killing thousands.

52:34.069 --> 52:36.697
So we're talking
global warming, right?

52:36.738 --> 52:38.615
Yes and no.

52:38.699 --> 52:42.953
Yes in that we show an increase in
global temperature over the last decade.

52:43.036 --> 52:46.541
It's not much, but if you factor out
the cooling effects of volcanoes...

52:46.541 --> 52:48.001
It's happening.

52:48.084 --> 52:53.548
Our factories can't pump out 7 billion
tons of CO2 a year and not do damage.

53:14.654 --> 53:16.448
This is the Arctic?

53:16.531 --> 53:18.992
Ninety miles from the Pole.

53:19.076 --> 53:21.161
What's it doing there?

53:21.203 --> 53:24.164
Taken by itself,
it's just another anomaly.

53:24.247 --> 53:28.836
But as a whole... The Arctic is
very sensitive to environmental change.

53:28.961 --> 53:32.298
That's why we go there.
Things happen first in the Arctic.

53:32.382 --> 53:35.218
It's like a window on the future.

53:35.259 --> 53:39.473
So you're talking about something
a lot bigger than global warming.

53:39.556 --> 53:43.685
I see some major
climatic ordeal happening.

53:43.727 --> 53:45.020
God.

53:46.146 --> 53:48.732
I get so damned apocalyptic
when I drink.

53:48.816 --> 53:52.362
But you have to remember, every
major turning point on this planet...

53:52.404 --> 53:56.241
including the demise of the dinosaur,
began with a shift in climate.

53:56.324 --> 53:58.993
Even a ten degree increase...

53:59.077 --> 54:02.038
will melt 70% of the polar icecap...

54:02.122 --> 54:03.415
wipe out all agriculture.

54:03.540 --> 54:07.002
Raise the temperature of the planet
to change its atmosphere...

54:07.086 --> 54:09.213
into one suitable
to colonization.

54:09.296 --> 54:12.758
- Terraforming.
- What is that?

54:12.842 --> 54:16.095
This guy at J.P.L.,
he's been giving talks about Mars...

54:16.137 --> 54:18.432
and how its whole environment
could be changed...

54:18.515 --> 54:20.434
and how we can terraform it
and then live there.

54:20.517 --> 54:22.769
It'll never happen, of course.
It'd cost hundreds of billions.

54:22.853 --> 54:25.230
But he did say something about...

54:25.313 --> 54:27.899
After the polar ice
has been melted...

54:27.941 --> 54:30.611
the atmosphere again
grows thicker.

54:30.653 --> 54:34.782
Finally, a kind of
critical mass is reached.

54:34.824 --> 54:36.617
What?

54:37.410 --> 54:38.995
I don't know.

54:39.078 --> 54:42.123
We might give him a call
if it's not too...

54:42.206 --> 54:45.502
Jesus, I did
the time warp dance here.

55:04.022 --> 55:08.443
Before I go around saying the sky
is falling or even warming...

55:08.526 --> 55:10.488
I've got to get new gear from N-CAR.

55:10.571 --> 55:12.907
- When do you leave?
- First thing in the morning.

55:12.990 --> 55:15.451
- You?
- I don't know yet.

55:15.534 --> 55:17.787
I still haven't seen
everything I need to see.

55:17.912 --> 55:19.997
Maybe a couple of days.

55:20.122 --> 55:24.544
I must say, Zane,
I really enjoyed our talk tonight.

55:24.628 --> 55:29.800
It's uncommon to find someone who can
grasp the things I'm passionate about.

55:29.841 --> 55:31.718
Yeah, I hear you.

55:31.802 --> 55:32.886
Where you staying?

55:32.928 --> 55:36.307
I was in room 302
at the big pink place...

55:36.391 --> 55:39.310
until it merged with room 402.

55:39.394 --> 55:42.772
- Some kind of an accident?
- Everything is lately.

55:44.190 --> 55:47.068
- How is this dump?
- It's not bad with the lights off.

55:47.151 --> 55:49.488
- Maybe I'll get a room.
- Well, look.

55:50.406 --> 55:52.074
I'm gone early in the morning.

55:52.157 --> 55:55.953
Why don't you stay here now
and keep the room tomorrow?

55:56.036 --> 55:58.038
You mean, share it?

55:59.081 --> 56:01.042
There is a couch.

56:01.084 --> 56:03.878
We could at least keep
the appearance of respectability.

56:05.964 --> 56:08.508
I suppose we could.

56:08.591 --> 56:11.511
Not that I don't find
the proposition intriguing.

56:11.594 --> 56:14.682
Not that you just propositioned me.
Did you?

56:16.267 --> 56:19.437
Boy, that's a lot of guilt for
someone who hasn't done anything yet.

56:22.481 --> 56:26.235
I take it there's a warm body
in bed at home.

56:26.277 --> 56:28.739
Out of my bed,
still in my head.

56:28.780 --> 56:30.741
I don't know.

56:30.782 --> 56:35.328
I guess there's still something
to be said for abstinence. You think?

56:37.622 --> 56:39.040
In moderation.

56:48.926 --> 56:53.474
Terraforming. If you find anything,
get it to me, in care of UCLA.

56:54.266 --> 56:55.684
I will.

57:00.731 --> 57:02.149
What? Yes?

57:03.025 --> 57:05.235
Just be careful.

57:47.031 --> 57:48.991
Change for the phone?

58:12.892 --> 58:15.103
Man, it was good
to hear your voice.

58:17.522 --> 58:20.108
I'm really sorry about before,
but I tried to...

58:20.191 --> 58:24.363
No, no, no. You're right.
I was a complete asshole.

58:24.405 --> 58:28.617
We will get back to that,
but you still get downloads at home?

58:28.701 --> 58:30.953
- Stock stuff?
- Yeah, but...

58:31.036 --> 58:32.413
Planecorp Industries.

58:32.496 --> 58:34.999
Check it out for me, will ya?

58:53.060 --> 58:57.315
Slow modem. Still waiting.
When are you coming home, Zane?

58:57.398 --> 59:00.318
I'm not exactly...

59:00.401 --> 59:02.737
- Who said I was gone?
- I stopped by yesterday.

59:02.820 --> 59:05.783
The papers were stacking up
so I put them inside.

59:05.866 --> 59:10.579
Here we go. Ticker P.L.C.,
Planecorp Industries.

59:10.662 --> 59:13.832
A leader in clean air technology.
Blah, blah, blah.

59:13.916 --> 59:18.254
They buy up old power utilities,
overhaul and put them back on line.

59:18.296 --> 59:20.840
Ecuador, Peru,
three facilities in Mexico.

59:20.924 --> 59:23.426
Wait a minute. Back up.
There's more than one plant?

59:23.510 --> 59:27.055
As of January 1, they have
eight facilities on line...

59:27.097 --> 59:29.975
and 12 more planned,
all in third-world countries.

59:30.059 --> 59:33.020
Twenty plants?
Where's all the money coming from?

59:33.104 --> 59:35.773
American investors.
Your mutual funds at work.

59:35.856 --> 59:37.942
Wow.

59:38.025 --> 59:40.277
Well, thanks for the help, Char.

59:40.361 --> 59:42.948
Wh... What? That's it?

59:43.031 --> 59:45.575
After four weeks, you call me up
for a stock report?

59:45.659 --> 59:49.538
l... I don't know
what else to say.

59:49.621 --> 59:51.915
How about "I miss you"?

59:53.083 --> 59:55.169
I shouldn't have to say it.

01:01:34.943 --> 01:01:37.237
If that's it...

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:38.780
how big does that make the...

01:02:43.183 --> 01:02:46.145
Oh, my God.

01:04:39.224 --> 01:04:41.435
I'm sorry.

01:14:22.978 --> 01:14:25.314
Do you want to see the ruins,
my friend?

01:16:40.752 --> 01:16:43.463
Mr. Zaminsky, we caught you speeding
on the wrong side of the road.

01:16:43.463 --> 01:16:44.839
Mr. Zaminsky, we caught you speeding
on the wrong side of the road.

01:16:44.881 --> 01:16:47.717
Then you said you were
in the cantina last night...

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:49.344
with Senorita what's-her-name?

01:16:49.385 --> 01:16:51.514
Green. Ilana Green.

01:16:51.597 --> 01:16:53.682
I suppose you were drinking.

01:16:53.766 --> 01:16:56.060
We had a couple of beers.
That has nothing to do...

01:16:56.143 --> 01:16:59.396
This week is El Dia de los Muertos,
the Day of the Dead.

01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:00.731
So what?

01:17:00.815 --> 01:17:03.567
As an American, you're not
familiar with these costumes...

01:17:03.652 --> 01:17:05.904
with all these things
we see all around.

01:17:05.946 --> 01:17:08.490
Wrong.
What I saw was no costume...

01:17:08.573 --> 01:17:10.826
was no paper mache skeleton.

01:17:10.909 --> 01:17:12.327
It was nothing like that.

01:17:19.377 --> 01:17:22.421
The captain of security for
the power station has called...

01:17:22.505 --> 01:17:24.924
to report an accident.

01:17:25.007 --> 01:17:27.510
That a man, intoxicated...

01:17:27.593 --> 01:17:30.889
killed someone with his car
last night.

01:17:34.184 --> 01:17:35.602
An American man.

01:17:35.686 --> 01:17:38.438
No, that is not what happened.

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:41.108
- That is to say you were involved.
- They are lying!

01:17:41.191 --> 01:17:43.611
It's up to me
to decide who's lying.

01:17:43.695 --> 01:17:46.865
That's why I make the questions,
and you give me answers.

01:17:46.948 --> 01:17:49.159
Now, again,
were you involved in this?

01:17:50.118 --> 01:17:53.454
I hit something...

01:17:53.538 --> 01:17:55.290
with the car.

01:17:55.373 --> 01:17:58.419
Now, who it was or what it was,
I'm not sure.

01:17:58.502 --> 01:18:01.380
But if they're saying I killed
someone, I want to see it.

01:18:01.463 --> 01:18:03.591
Bring the body.
I demand to see it!

01:18:03.632 --> 01:18:06.635
There's no need to demand that,
Mr. Zaminsky.

01:18:06.677 --> 01:18:08.512
That's exactly what they're doing.

01:18:20.108 --> 01:18:22.028
Don't go anywhere.

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:13.207
Our word for an attorney
is abogado.

01:19:13.290 --> 01:19:15.001
I suggest you...

01:19:42.197 --> 01:19:44.408
Mercury peaks
around 99 degrees today.

01:19:44.491 --> 01:19:47.452
Yes, that will be a record
for this day in October.

01:19:47.536 --> 01:19:50.330
But nowhere is it hotter right now
than in the hallways of NASA...

01:19:50.414 --> 01:19:52.583
where officials are still
trying to explain...

01:19:52.666 --> 01:19:54.752
what happened yesterday
to that atmospheric satellite...

01:19:54.836 --> 01:19:57.922
that blew up just 32 seconds
after launch.

01:19:58.006 --> 01:20:01.092
Press conference now underway
at J.P.L. in Pasadena.

01:20:03.553 --> 01:20:05.555
Anybody gonna lose their job
over this?

01:20:05.638 --> 01:20:08.142
I'm really not the right p...

01:20:14.398 --> 01:20:15.482
You don't look too good.

01:20:15.566 --> 01:20:18.569
Actually, I look like a can
of smashed assholes.

01:20:19.529 --> 01:20:21.448
Here's a tip.

01:20:23.283 --> 01:20:27.245
If you ever get the chance to travel
with a Mexican rodeo...

01:20:27.329 --> 01:20:28.413
pass.

01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:33.711
Look, Zane,
about before, I'm sorry.

01:20:33.794 --> 01:20:36.422
D.O.D. was putting pressure on me
to keep a lid on things.

01:20:36.464 --> 01:20:38.799
Then you start asking questions
in front of all those people.

01:20:38.841 --> 01:20:41.302
No, no. Forget it.
No hard feelings.

01:20:41.344 --> 01:20:43.804
I just wanted to drop by
and pay you a visit...

01:20:43.888 --> 01:20:46.058
check up on my old buddy Gordy...

01:20:46.141 --> 01:20:48.435
maybe see what's really what...

01:20:48.477 --> 01:20:50.771
who's really who.

01:20:50.812 --> 01:20:54.149
I tell you, Zane, you're really
not making very much sense.

01:20:54.233 --> 01:20:55.943
We should walk over
to the infirmary.

01:20:55.984 --> 01:20:58.613
It didn't make a lot of sense
to me either...

01:20:58.655 --> 01:21:02.992
the first time I saw your face
on another guy.

01:21:03.076 --> 01:21:05.995
Genetic dice?
No, I don't think so.

01:21:06.079 --> 01:21:08.122
I think somebody just screwed up.

01:21:08.164 --> 01:21:11.710
As good as you are,
you do make mistakes, don't you?

01:21:11.794 --> 01:21:14.171
They should have
broke the mold, Gordy.

01:21:19.802 --> 01:21:22.388
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

01:21:24.349 --> 01:21:27.644
I wanna blow a hole in your head
and donate your organs to science.

01:21:28.687 --> 01:21:31.815
But there are a few things
I need to know first.

01:21:35.735 --> 01:21:38.489
Fuckin' N.R.A.

01:21:38.531 --> 01:21:40.533
It's just so easy to get one.

01:21:42.285 --> 01:21:44.203
Let's have a chat.

01:21:46.998 --> 01:21:49.167
Yeah. Okay.

01:21:49.208 --> 01:21:51.211
Media Center. Looks like somebody
stole some camera gear.

01:21:51.295 --> 01:21:53.881
- You want it?
- A real crime.

01:21:53.964 --> 01:21:55.507
Somebody's on the way.

01:21:55.549 --> 01:21:58.385
So who was targeted?
Anyone in SETI?

01:21:58.468 --> 01:22:01.221
Well, not anyone.

01:22:01.263 --> 01:22:03.433
Who then?

01:22:03.516 --> 01:22:05.643
Look in the mirror.
Prime intellect.

01:22:05.727 --> 01:22:08.980
Nonconformist reasoning.
Capacity for lateral thinking.

01:22:09.063 --> 01:22:11.024
- Isn't that what you see?
- And then what?

01:22:11.107 --> 01:22:14.194
A control is assigned?
Somebody like you?

01:22:14.277 --> 01:22:18.032
Could I actually see
this gun of yours, Zane?

01:22:18.073 --> 01:22:22.036
Oh, sure. But if I pull it out,
it'll be the last thing you ever see.

01:22:24.079 --> 01:22:26.707
Well, I think
it's possible to say...

01:22:26.749 --> 01:22:29.461
that you've been watched
for quite a while now.

01:22:29.544 --> 01:22:33.590
So which programs
besides SETI? NASA?

01:22:35.217 --> 01:22:39.804
Ask yourself why an antenna
won't deploy on a deep-space probe.

01:22:39.888 --> 01:22:42.308
Or ask how they could launch
a $6 billion telescope...

01:22:42.391 --> 01:22:43.976
without testing its mirror.

01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:46.312
- What you're actually saying...
- I'm saying nothing.

01:22:46.395 --> 01:22:48.439
I'm just listening to you
ask questions.

01:22:49.857 --> 01:22:51.901
Then I'll ask about Planecorp.

01:22:54.612 --> 01:22:55.948
Planecorp.

01:22:58.242 --> 01:22:59.743
Sorry, I don't know what that is.

01:22:59.785 --> 01:23:03.830
You know, it's that factory
down in Mexico.

01:23:03.914 --> 01:23:05.666
It's outside my knowledge.

01:23:05.749 --> 01:23:07.793
One of 20 being built
in third-world countries.

01:23:07.876 --> 01:23:10.296
- Outside.
- Where no laws protect the air.

01:23:10.338 --> 01:23:12.924
- Outside my knowledge.
- You build where it's hot.

01:23:12.966 --> 01:23:15.301
You like it hot, Gordy,
don't you?

01:23:17.136 --> 01:23:19.764
Zane, if you force me
to answer you...

01:23:19.848 --> 01:23:22.142
what you will be hearing
is your own death sentence.

01:23:22.226 --> 01:23:25.479
Now, as much as you think you know,
you don't know the half of it.

01:23:25.521 --> 01:23:28.732
Right now, you're just one little guy
with a big conspiracy theory...

01:23:28.816 --> 01:23:31.277
and no proof,
and the world is full of them.

01:23:31.318 --> 01:23:33.445
So, Zane, you take great care...

01:23:33.529 --> 01:23:36.449
in what else you choose to learn.

01:23:38.410 --> 01:23:40.203
They're terraform factories?

01:23:41.079 --> 01:23:44.624
- Yes.
- You're pumping out greenhouse gas.

01:23:44.708 --> 01:23:46.793
- Now you're dead.
- You're changing the air...

01:23:46.835 --> 01:23:48.796
the temperature,
the whole ecosystem.

01:23:48.838 --> 01:23:50.923
We're just finishing
what you started.

01:23:51.007 --> 01:23:53.134
What would've taken you 100 years
we'll do in 10.

01:23:53.217 --> 01:23:55.636
Just speeding along
your own demise.

01:23:55.678 --> 01:23:59.640
Like you sped Calvin along,
and Ilana Green, right?

01:23:59.724 --> 01:24:02.603
If you can't tend
to your own planet...

01:24:02.686 --> 01:24:04.980
none of you deserve to live here.

01:24:07.649 --> 01:24:10.402
Bang. You're dead.

01:24:20.663 --> 01:24:22.332
Don't tell me that's
who I think it is.

01:24:22.373 --> 01:24:25.168
We have a problem here?

01:24:27.379 --> 01:24:30.007
No. No problem.

01:24:37.014 --> 01:24:39.935
I'm gonna handle this myself.

01:24:42.270 --> 01:24:43.730
Geez!

01:24:45.857 --> 01:24:47.817
Zane, what are you
doing out here?

01:24:47.901 --> 01:24:50.529
You scared the living...

01:24:51.530 --> 01:24:53.658
Who's been here? Anyone?

01:24:53.741 --> 01:24:56.827
- Anybody been watching my house?
- Nobody I seen.

01:24:56.911 --> 01:24:58.454
I can't believe they wouldn't be.

01:24:59.747 --> 01:25:04.085
I'm gonna say something that's
gonna sound completely insane.

01:25:04.126 --> 01:25:07.381
I'm telling you because I think
you might actually believe me.

01:25:07.422 --> 01:25:10.717
I'm also telling you because
I can't be the only one who knows...

01:25:10.759 --> 01:25:13.720
in case they find me...

01:25:13.762 --> 01:25:16.890
- before I finish this.
- Tell me.

01:25:16.932 --> 01:25:20.061
I followed the signal to Mexico
because we thought somebody was...

01:25:20.103 --> 01:25:21.229
Yeah, yeah.

01:25:23.773 --> 01:25:26.150
They weren't "us," Kiki.

01:25:27.402 --> 01:25:28.778
So what was they?

01:25:33.450 --> 01:25:35.786
Do they got these little
flashlight fingers that...

01:25:38.497 --> 01:25:41.417
Maybe they got these big metal teeth
that come out and sort of...

01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:45.672
What does they look like then?

01:25:45.755 --> 01:25:49.259
Like you. Like me. Like anyone.

01:25:50.302 --> 01:25:53.763
- What they doing here?
- I'll show you.

01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:58.436
I'll show everyone, as soon
as I fire up the array.

01:26:08.404 --> 01:26:10.824
Shit!
You've been evicted.

01:26:13.577 --> 01:26:17.122
I gotta get out to Oro Valley,
out to the big dish.

01:26:17.164 --> 01:26:19.208
Hold this. Don't drop it.

01:26:20.959 --> 01:26:22.044
What game does it play?

01:26:24.756 --> 01:26:26.299
Where's the start button?

01:26:56.957 --> 01:26:59.876
- You going to let me in?
- Who's Char?

01:27:01.628 --> 01:27:04.215
I can't stay. If they're not
here now, they will be soon.

01:27:04.298 --> 01:27:06.050
Who? The police?

01:27:07.718 --> 01:27:09.178
What about the police?

01:27:10.221 --> 01:27:12.473
They came to my work,
some detective.

01:27:12.557 --> 01:27:15.519
He said something about
manslaughter charges in Mexico.

01:27:15.561 --> 01:27:17.771
You're a fugitive?
Ooh, that's phat.

01:27:17.855 --> 01:27:20.023
The whole thing was fabricated.
They set me up.

01:27:20.107 --> 01:27:22.693
I don't understand.
Why would the police want to...

01:27:22.776 --> 01:27:25.737
Not the police.
It was them.

01:27:25.737 --> 01:27:28.616
Them. Who's them?

01:27:31.828 --> 01:27:35.540
- Forget it.
- Probably the aliens.

01:27:35.665 --> 01:27:39.460
Who is this child?
And I hope he means illegal aliens.

01:27:39.544 --> 01:27:41.462
I'll take your car.
Give me that.

01:27:41.547 --> 01:27:43.215
No, you won't.

01:27:43.257 --> 01:27:45.467
Not until I know
what is going on here.

01:27:45.509 --> 01:27:49.054
Look, it sounds nuts,
but I know what I saw.

01:27:49.054 --> 01:27:52.224
I know why they're here. I know
about the poppy field in the Arctic.

01:27:52.266 --> 01:27:55.228
Their whole master plan
about the air and the...

01:27:57.898 --> 01:27:59.566
Give me the keys.

01:27:59.608 --> 01:28:03.195
I can't let you go, Zane.
Not alone, not like this.

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:06.865
You don't have to come. I wouldn't
believe it unless I'd seen it myself.

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:09.952
But, Char, I must leave now.

01:28:14.832 --> 01:28:17.627
If you think I'm letting you
out of my sight, you are nuts.

01:28:39.859 --> 01:28:41.528
Can I come?

01:28:41.611 --> 01:28:43.988
Get off me!
This isn't a field trip.

01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:46.282
I left my grandma a note.
I want to help.

01:28:46.407 --> 01:28:47.826
Drive!

01:29:08.139 --> 01:29:11.017
Pull over at the on-ramp.
I'll drive.

01:29:11.101 --> 01:29:13.020
I've got shotgun.

01:29:13.104 --> 01:29:16.440
Zane, I think that you've got
to deal with this somehow.

01:29:16.524 --> 01:29:19.318
If it means both of us going
to the police and explain...

01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:22.446
I can't get stuck in some jail.
Not now.

01:29:23.573 --> 01:29:26.326
Please, pull over.

01:29:45.388 --> 01:29:48.182
We're here. Now, what do you
hope to accomplish?

01:29:52.897 --> 01:29:55.816
Keys. Keys.

01:30:17.965 --> 01:30:19.467
Where's Char?

01:30:25.389 --> 01:30:26.641
What are you doing?

01:30:27.767 --> 01:30:31.063
Getting my stuff out of the car.
That all right?

01:30:32.689 --> 01:30:36.401
I just... The strangest thoughts.

01:30:45.203 --> 01:30:47.664
Kiki, if it says "power,"
you push it.

01:30:47.747 --> 01:30:51.292
These monitors, this stuff here.
Light it up... everything.

01:30:51.334 --> 01:30:54.337
Find OMNI Star 5.
I'll need two sets of coordinates.

01:30:54.420 --> 01:30:56.464
Right ascension and declination.

01:30:56.548 --> 01:30:59.051
I don't see how listening
to some star...

01:30:59.176 --> 01:31:03.264
It's not a star, and this time
we're talking, not listening.

01:31:09.854 --> 01:31:13.275
So this is some kind
of satellite in orbit?

01:31:13.316 --> 01:31:15.277
It's a co-op weather satellite...

01:31:15.318 --> 01:31:19.072
one that about 50 TV stations
pull a continuous feed off of.

01:31:19.155 --> 01:31:21.324
A hundred thousand watts
ought to get their attention.

01:31:21.408 --> 01:31:24.120
- They'll understand what this means?
- We're gonna find out...

01:31:24.161 --> 01:31:26.122
right now.

01:31:50.523 --> 01:31:52.483
Shit.

01:31:52.525 --> 01:31:53.860
What's happening?

01:32:00.909 --> 01:32:03.495
What is wrong with this thing?

01:32:17.010 --> 01:32:20.013
Gardening. I didn't see
any gardens around here.

01:32:35.196 --> 01:32:38.366
What are they doing here, Char?

01:32:39.867 --> 01:32:40.952
Like I should know.

01:32:41.912 --> 01:32:43.247
You made a call...

01:32:43.330 --> 01:32:45.290
from the car.

01:32:45.374 --> 01:32:48.377
When you start talking
about aliens and master plans...

01:32:48.460 --> 01:32:50.295
and this woman
being killed in Mexico...

01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:52.965
Did I mention
that it was a woman?

01:32:53.048 --> 01:32:55.760
The police told me, okay?

01:32:55.885 --> 01:32:58.346
Ah. And that's who you called,
right, Char?

01:32:58.471 --> 01:33:01.057
- You called the police.
- Yes, it is.

01:33:01.057 --> 01:33:03.268
You were scaring me with your talk.
You're scaring me now.

01:33:03.309 --> 01:33:05.979
As soon as I left SETI,
you left.

01:33:06.062 --> 01:33:10.192
As soon as I got back from Mexico,
there you were, waiting for me.

01:33:10.234 --> 01:33:12.736
Because I thought you
might need me, Zane.

01:33:12.778 --> 01:33:16.031
Like I needed
all that career advice?

01:33:16.115 --> 01:33:18.033
The gentle persuasion...

01:33:18.117 --> 01:33:20.996
the little nudges about how
I was wasting my life!

01:34:25.398 --> 01:34:28.318
Cold. Too cold.

01:34:47.922 --> 01:34:49.507
I'm sorry.

01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:51.301
I am just so sorry.

01:34:52.219 --> 01:34:54.054
I didn't believe about...

01:34:58.559 --> 01:35:02.854
You've got to trust me when I say
that I only called the police...

01:35:02.896 --> 01:35:06.276
- and only because I wanted...
- Then what are they doing here?

01:35:07.610 --> 01:35:09.571
Who told them to find me here?

01:35:09.612 --> 01:35:10.697
I don't know.

01:35:13.533 --> 01:35:17.496
I honestly do not know.

01:35:29.925 --> 01:35:31.803
Watch this screen.

01:35:31.845 --> 01:35:36.099
When you see my face,
hit the red key right there next to you.

01:35:36.182 --> 01:35:38.602
- The transmit key.
- You ain't leaving me here?

01:35:38.685 --> 01:35:41.438
Don't worry.
They'll be chasing us.

01:35:44.650 --> 01:35:49.071
We're going to give this
one more shot.

01:35:58.165 --> 01:35:59.625
Go.

01:36:09.469 --> 01:36:12.055
No, it's this way. Go.

01:37:49.159 --> 01:37:50.911
Give me the chain.

01:37:50.994 --> 01:37:52.996
You can move the dish from here.
Go. I can do this.

01:37:54.290 --> 01:37:57.752
For once in your paranoid life,
please just trust me.

01:38:59.485 --> 01:39:00.778
Now, Kiki.

01:39:05.199 --> 01:39:07.076
Now, Kiki! Hit it now!

01:39:09.036 --> 01:39:12.583
Kiki, the red transmit key.
Hit it now!

01:39:15.752 --> 01:39:17.838
Kiki, for shit's sake,
hit it now!

01:39:17.921 --> 01:39:19.840
Now! Now!

01:39:19.923 --> 01:39:21.842
Hit it now!

01:39:52.125 --> 01:39:53.209
Like I said.

01:39:59.049 --> 01:40:01.760
You didn't know the half of it.

01:40:08.225 --> 01:40:11.062
Zane, what happened?

01:40:24.117 --> 01:40:26.453
Why did they leave?

01:40:26.536 --> 01:40:27.913
They didn't.

01:40:28.664 --> 01:40:29.749
How do you know?

01:40:32.252 --> 01:40:34.254
Because we aren't dead yet.

01:40:46.308 --> 01:40:48.269
Help me.

01:41:04.828 --> 01:41:06.538
Move!

01:43:34.448 --> 01:43:37.951
Zane, can we get out of here now?

01:43:38.035 --> 01:43:39.911
Not that way.

01:43:47.962 --> 01:43:50.256
I'll be right behind you.

01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:49.926
Not... so... fast.

01:47:44.050 --> 01:47:46.719
Oh, please. Oh, please.

01:47:46.802 --> 01:47:48.220
Please.

01:48:36.982 --> 01:48:40.068
Why did it have to be like this?

01:48:41.611 --> 01:48:44.448
Why couldn't you just come
and ask for our help?

01:48:47.743 --> 01:48:50.204
Then you tell them...

01:48:50.288 --> 01:48:52.915
You go back and tell them...

01:48:52.999 --> 01:48:56.210
that I know, that she knows...

01:48:56.294 --> 01:48:58.422
that others will know!

01:48:59.464 --> 01:49:01.258
It's not going to be easy.

01:49:01.300 --> 01:49:03.260
Not anymore.

01:49:30.497 --> 01:49:33.208
Summer is just refusing
to go away.

01:49:33.292 --> 01:49:35.252
Record highs again
in the Big Apple...

01:49:35.336 --> 01:49:39.215
while New England states report
a delay of the fall foliage season.

01:49:39.299 --> 01:49:44.721
It's been warmer than normal
up and down the Eastern seaboard.

01:49:44.804 --> 01:49:47.182
They're terraform factories?

01:49:47.265 --> 01:49:50.728
- Yes.
- You're pumping out greenhouse gas.

01:49:50.811 --> 01:49:53.022
- Now you're dead.
- You're changing the air...

01:49:53.105 --> 01:49:55.066
the temperature,
the whole ecosystem.

01:49:55.149 --> 01:49:56.817
We're just finishing
what you started.

01:49:56.859 --> 01:49:59.779
What would've taken you 100 years
we'll do in 10.

01:49:59.862 --> 01:50:01.948
Just speeding along
your own demise.

01:50:02.031 --> 01:50:05.953
Like you sped Calvin along,
and Ilana Green, right?

01:50:06.036 --> 01:50:08.997
If you can't tend
to your own planet...

01:50:09.039 --> 01:50:11.875
none of you deserve to live here.
