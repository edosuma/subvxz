NARRATOR:
Previously onWhy Women Kill...

00:06.180 --> 00:08.704
-Marry me.
-You'd be raising
another man's baby.

00:08.747 --> 00:10.184
With the woman I love.

00:10.227 --> 00:11.663
You know Rita Castillo?

00:11.707 --> 00:14.275
-Is she ill?
-No, but she has a husband.

00:14.318 --> 00:15.798
He's in so much pain.

00:15.841 --> 00:18.018
You really want me to kill
Carlo Castillo?

00:18.061 --> 00:20.368
And if the police
did do an autopsy,

00:20.411 --> 00:22.674
would they find
the drug that you used?

00:22.718 --> 00:24.285
They'd have to be looking
for it,

00:24.328 --> 00:25.808
and they wouldn't be
unless they suspected foul play.

00:25.851 --> 00:27.897
I need you to screw her tonight.

00:27.940 --> 00:29.899
Carlo is starting
to communicate.

00:29.942 --> 00:32.510
Once we have the photo,
Catherine will go back home.

00:32.554 --> 00:33.685
I won't be too late.

00:33.729 --> 00:35.209
I'll tuck you in
when I come home.

00:35.252 --> 00:37.646
She's going to have sex tonight.

00:37.689 --> 00:40.040
If you hadn't threatened
to disinherit her,

00:40.083 --> 00:41.998
I wouldn't have anything
to blackmail her with.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.086
ISABEL:
We can kill him.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.174
Gotten away with it before.

00:44.218 --> 00:46.829
Elysian Park is not Galveston.

00:46.872 --> 00:48.744
I won't go inside.
I'll stay in the car.

00:48.787 --> 00:50.311
Keep watch, just in case.

00:50.354 --> 00:52.878
And I'm here to relieve you
of your suffering.

00:52.922 --> 00:54.184
[groaning]

00:56.143 --> 00:57.361
[thunder cracks]

01:05.456 --> 01:07.241
I overheard his wife Rita
saying things

01:07.284 --> 01:09.808
about the money
that she expected to inherit

01:09.852 --> 01:10.940
"any day now."

01:10.983 --> 01:12.637
It's a good thing you called.

01:16.554 --> 01:19.818
NARRATOR:
The widow Castillo sat
on her sofa that morning

01:19.862 --> 01:24.519
thinking about her dreams
and how they'd all come true.

01:25.563 --> 01:28.871
Her brute of a husband was dead.

01:28.914 --> 01:32.657
And she was now insanely rich.

01:32.701 --> 01:34.137
Yes.

01:34.181 --> 01:35.747
Rita had the feeling

01:35.791 --> 01:38.272
she'd be happy
for the rest of her life.

01:38.315 --> 01:40.535
[pounding on door]

01:40.578 --> 01:42.319
She was wrong.

01:46.410 --> 01:47.933
RITA:
What?

01:47.977 --> 01:49.979
[stammers] Wait.
What, what are you doing?

01:50.022 --> 01:52.068
Excuse me. Hello?

01:52.112 --> 01:53.765
Excuse me!

01:53.809 --> 01:55.158
Where are they going?

01:55.202 --> 01:56.855
Ma'am, we have a search warrant.

01:56.899 --> 01:58.944
Why do you need
to search my house?

01:58.988 --> 02:01.947
I asked them to solve
the mystery of Papa's death.

02:01.991 --> 02:03.688
Mystery? He had a heart attack.

02:03.732 --> 02:06.169
That's what we thought
until we performed an autopsy.

02:06.213 --> 02:07.779
And who asked you to do that?

02:07.823 --> 02:09.520
I did.

02:09.564 --> 02:11.261
It was my last gift to Papa.

02:11.305 --> 02:13.089
That's what you call a gift?

02:13.133 --> 02:14.786
An autopsy?

02:14.830 --> 02:17.746
Well, now I know what
I'm getting you for Christmas.

02:18.964 --> 02:20.749
Isabel, get me another drink.

02:24.318 --> 02:27.364
Mrs. Castillo, we have evidence
your husband was poisoned.

02:27.408 --> 02:28.800
Poisoned?

02:28.844 --> 02:30.541
That's impossible.

02:30.585 --> 02:31.977
We also know you were
the only one upstairs with him.

02:32.021 --> 02:34.241
And you stand to inherit
half his estate.

02:34.284 --> 02:37.722
She gets the other half,
and she was here, too.

02:37.766 --> 02:41.465
I was downstairs,
on that sofa with a friend.

02:41.509 --> 02:43.424
We talked all night long.

02:43.467 --> 02:45.600
Talked. Yeah, right.

02:45.643 --> 02:47.297
I didn't go upstairs until 6:00.

02:47.341 --> 02:50.300
And the coroner said Papa died
before 1:00.

02:50.344 --> 02:51.736
This is ludicrous.

02:51.780 --> 02:54.217
My husband was old and sick.

02:54.261 --> 02:56.567
All I had to do was wait
for him to die.

02:56.611 --> 03:00.267
And I am a very patient woman.

03:00.310 --> 03:02.356
Where the hell is my drink?

03:03.357 --> 03:05.837
She was cheating on Papa,

03:05.881 --> 03:07.317
but I think he found out.

03:07.361 --> 03:09.754
I think he was planning
to divorce her.

03:09.798 --> 03:11.669
That would be motive.

03:11.713 --> 03:14.890
I refuse to listen
to another word.

03:14.933 --> 03:17.109
Going somewhere, Mrs. Castillo?

03:17.153 --> 03:19.460
Yes, to my lawyer.

03:19.503 --> 03:21.244
I'm going to sue all of you
for libel.

03:21.288 --> 03:22.854
What's in the purse?

03:22.898 --> 03:25.117
-Why?
-You just seem
in kind of a hurry

03:25.161 --> 03:26.554
to get it out of the house.

03:26.597 --> 03:29.209
You are ridiculous,
you know that?

03:33.082 --> 03:34.039
There.

03:34.083 --> 03:35.389
Satisfied?

03:54.016 --> 03:56.061
[crowd chattering]

04:00.457 --> 04:03.286
NARRATOR:
As she arrived
at the police station,

04:03.330 --> 04:05.201
Rita wondered
how her new happiness

04:05.245 --> 04:07.986
could have vanished so quickly.

04:08.030 --> 04:09.858
-[reporters clamoring]
-MAN: Hey, Rita, over here.

04:10.859 --> 04:13.644
NARRATOR:
She had no idea the answer...

04:16.430 --> 04:18.910
was staring her in the face.

04:27.832 --> 04:29.878
â™ª

04:47.243 --> 04:49.811
The arrest of her archnemesis

04:49.854 --> 04:53.902
had left Alma Fillcot
in the best possible mood.

04:53.945 --> 04:57.775
Her scheming had yielded
the results she'd hoped for.

04:57.819 --> 04:59.603
And she was as happy

04:59.647 --> 05:01.344
as she'd ever been.

05:02.345 --> 05:04.173
Sadly...

05:04.216 --> 05:07.568
the same could not be said
for her husband.

05:07.611 --> 05:09.309
Have you spoken to Rita?

05:10.527 --> 05:12.050
Why?

05:12.094 --> 05:13.443
Well, it's been four days
since we killed Carlo.

05:13.487 --> 05:15.489
I'm just worried about her.

05:15.532 --> 05:18.056
I keep wondering how she's
feeling, if she's happier now.

05:18.100 --> 05:21.233
Well, I've left messages,
but she hasn't called me back.

05:21.277 --> 05:23.758
Perhaps you can pop by
and visit her.

05:23.801 --> 05:24.846
See how she's doing.

05:24.889 --> 05:25.977
You're sweet to be concerned,

05:26.021 --> 05:28.415
but I'm sure Rita is just fine.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.765
-Thank you.
-Hmm. Morning, Dee.

05:30.808 --> 05:32.462
Would you like some breakfast?

05:32.506 --> 05:34.725
-Oh, I can't stay.
I got a job interview.
-Oh.

05:34.769 --> 05:37.075
But I did want to know

05:37.119 --> 05:38.686
if you two had plans
for dinner tonight.

05:38.729 --> 05:41.166
I don't think so. Why?

05:41.210 --> 05:42.777
There's someone
I want you to meet.

05:42.820 --> 05:44.822
Oh, who?

05:44.866 --> 05:46.781
This fella I know.

05:46.824 --> 05:48.478
Actually, he's my fella.

05:48.522 --> 05:49.871
I have a fella.

05:49.914 --> 05:52.569
This, uh, this
the young man who...?

05:52.613 --> 05:54.005
No, no. It's not Scooter.

05:54.049 --> 05:55.050
Who's Scooter?

05:55.093 --> 05:57.182
So, this is a new boyfriend?

05:57.226 --> 05:58.270
Was there an old boyfriend?

05:58.314 --> 06:00.011
I met Vern last month.

06:00.055 --> 06:02.231
He's smart and he's kind.

06:02.274 --> 06:03.450
And I love him.

06:03.493 --> 06:05.060
[gasps] Darling.

06:05.103 --> 06:07.105
-Does he love you back?
-Oh, yes.

06:07.149 --> 06:08.368
In fact...

06:08.411 --> 06:09.456
he proposed.

06:09.499 --> 06:10.805
[yelps]

06:11.936 --> 06:13.938
You're engaged?

06:13.982 --> 06:16.985
-[screaming, cheering]
-Oh!

06:17.028 --> 06:18.769
-Oh, my God.
-Oh!

06:18.813 --> 06:20.423
ALMA:
I'm so happy.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.686
Bertram! Oh, it's happened.

06:22.730 --> 06:24.819
-I told you not to lose faith.
-Yes.

06:24.862 --> 06:26.560
You said what now?

06:26.603 --> 06:29.040
Oh. I've just been so concerned
about your love life.

06:29.084 --> 06:31.260
I started praying to St. Jude
to send you a man to marry.

06:31.303 --> 06:32.870
And he finally came through!

06:32.914 --> 06:34.655
-[laughing] Oh. Oh.
-BERTRAM: Oh.

06:34.698 --> 06:36.874
Isn't he the patron saint
of lost causes?

06:36.918 --> 06:38.223
Oh, don't be insulted.

06:38.267 --> 06:40.225
Besides,
you can't argue with results.

06:40.269 --> 06:42.619
-My goodness.
-Oh. Ah.

06:48.495 --> 06:50.322
It's about time you showed up.

06:52.281 --> 06:54.718
May I offer my condolences
on the death of your husband?

06:54.762 --> 06:56.720
Yes. It's very sad.

06:56.764 --> 06:59.070
When can you post bail
and get me out of here?

06:59.114 --> 07:01.116
Well, this is only
a courtesy visit.

07:01.159 --> 07:03.945
I came to tell you I can't serve
as your attorney in this matter.

07:03.988 --> 07:05.990
It would be a conflict
of interest.

07:06.034 --> 07:07.992
But you're my family lawyer.

07:08.036 --> 07:09.777
I was
your late husband's lawyer,

07:09.820 --> 07:11.996
and you're not the only member
of his family.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.172
His daughter engaged my services
a week ago.

07:14.216 --> 07:16.479
And since your interests
and hers don't quite align,

07:16.523 --> 07:17.698
I can't represent you both.

07:17.741 --> 07:19.787
Then who is going
to bail me out?

07:19.830 --> 07:22.616
Yes, about that,
the judge denied bail.

07:22.659 --> 07:24.008
What?

07:24.052 --> 07:25.357
Catherine told him if you were
set free,

07:25.401 --> 07:26.750
you'd pose a danger to her.

07:26.794 --> 07:28.970
And he believed her?

07:29.013 --> 07:31.799
The judge was a personal friend
of Mr. Castillo's.

07:31.842 --> 07:33.365
He wishes to spare

07:33.409 --> 07:36.020
his now orphaned daughter
any further distress.

07:36.064 --> 07:37.761
Orphaned? She's 50.

07:37.805 --> 07:39.197
What about my distress?

07:39.241 --> 07:40.547
I'm the fucking widow.

07:40.590 --> 07:42.810
A circumstance
you might have avoided

07:42.853 --> 07:45.203
with a little more patience
and a little less poison.

07:47.205 --> 07:48.816
Wait!

07:48.859 --> 07:50.382
â™ª

07:50.426 --> 07:52.689
Ah. Hello, ladies.
Lovely to see you today.

07:52.733 --> 07:55.779
Doctor, have you heard the news?

07:55.823 --> 07:56.780
News? What news?

07:56.824 --> 07:58.347
It was just on the radio.

07:58.390 --> 08:00.697
Rita Castillo has been arrested.

08:00.741 --> 08:02.656
Arrested?

08:02.699 --> 08:04.832
Yes. They're saying
she killed her husband.

08:04.875 --> 08:06.703
Isn't it just terrible?

08:09.793 --> 08:11.795
Please.

08:13.536 --> 08:16.191
-[gasps] Doctor?
-Hmm?

08:16.234 --> 08:17.888
Are you okay?

08:18.889 --> 08:20.848
No, I-I don't think I am.

08:25.940 --> 08:27.985
[phone ringing]

08:29.900 --> 08:31.075
Hello?

08:31.119 --> 08:32.860
Oh, thank God you picked up.

08:32.903 --> 08:34.731
Rita, are you still in jail?

08:34.775 --> 08:37.081
Yes, I am. Thanks to Catherine.

08:37.125 --> 08:39.127
Now listen.
I need you to do something.

08:39.170 --> 08:40.955
Anything you need, Rita.

08:42.565 --> 08:44.349
Get the cash in my desk.

08:44.393 --> 08:46.917
Then go to Vern Loomis
and pay for the photos

08:46.961 --> 08:48.136
he took of Catherine last night.

08:50.051 --> 08:51.269
ISABEL:
The photos of Catherine
having sex?

08:51.313 --> 08:52.357
RITA:
Yes.

08:52.401 --> 08:54.011
Go through all the photos,

08:54.055 --> 08:55.317
and pick the one where Catherine
looks as indecent

08:55.360 --> 08:56.536
as possible.

08:56.579 --> 08:58.059
-Then what?
-Show it to her.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.582
Tell her everyone she knows

08:59.626 --> 09:00.627
is gonna get
a copy of that photo,

09:00.670 --> 09:01.628
if she doesn't tell the judge

09:01.671 --> 09:02.759
to give me bail.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.590
And then tell Vern
I need to see him today.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.287
Sorry. I got to go.

09:16.773 --> 09:18.819
[tires squeal, horn honks]

09:26.348 --> 09:28.132
Oh. Bertie.

09:28.176 --> 09:29.612
What are you doing home?

09:29.656 --> 09:31.614
Rita Castillo has been arrested.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.703
Oh. I know. I heard.

09:33.747 --> 09:35.792
-Oh, it's shocking.
-Shocking?

09:35.836 --> 09:37.533
Confounding, more like.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.622
How did they find out
that Carlo was poisoned?

09:39.666 --> 09:41.319
Well, I don't know.

09:41.363 --> 09:43.452
The drug you used
can't be detected. Right?

09:43.495 --> 09:44.845
Not unless you test for it.

09:44.888 --> 09:46.411
No one ever has, not once.

09:46.455 --> 09:48.239
-[under breath]: Careful.
-What?

09:48.283 --> 09:50.415
People are watching. [chuckles]

09:51.765 --> 09:53.027
Alma.

09:53.070 --> 09:54.637
Your friend is in jail.

09:54.681 --> 09:56.117
It's our fault.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.379
Why aren't you upset?

09:57.422 --> 09:59.033
Well, I am.

09:59.076 --> 10:01.426
Haven't you ever heard
of putting on a brave face?

10:01.470 --> 10:03.428
Perhaps we should call
the police.

10:03.472 --> 10:05.648
Tell them
they've made a mistake.

10:05.692 --> 10:08.390
And when they ask how we know
that, what will we tell them?

10:08.433 --> 10:10.784
I'm not sure, but we
can't just let her rot in jail.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.655
Oh, Bertram, relax.

10:12.699 --> 10:15.484
The police can't prove Rita
did something she didn't do.

10:15.527 --> 10:17.268
Let's hope you're right.

10:17.312 --> 10:18.879
Don't worry.

10:18.922 --> 10:20.184
I'm sure everything
will work out

10:20.228 --> 10:21.664
exactly as it should.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.277
Where are you off to?

10:26.321 --> 10:29.063
Oh, I have some unfinished
business to attend to.

10:29.106 --> 10:31.195
Downtown.
Put those in the good vase.

10:31.239 --> 10:33.197
I'll be back soon
to make a nice dinner.

10:33.241 --> 10:35.156
And don't forget,

10:35.199 --> 10:37.811
tonight we're meeting
our future son-in-law.

10:37.854 --> 10:39.943
All things considered,

10:39.987 --> 10:42.032
it's a happy day.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.089
Well?

10:55.132 --> 10:56.438
How'd it go?

10:56.481 --> 10:58.005
My parents can't wait
to meet you,

10:58.048 --> 10:59.659
and dinner
will be served at 7:30.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.270
And you told them everything?

11:02.313 --> 11:04.664
About the engagement
and the baby?

11:04.707 --> 11:06.056
I told them we're engaged.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.971
That was enough happiness
for one morning.

11:08.015 --> 11:09.973
-[sighs]
-[chuckles]

11:10.017 --> 11:13.281
Look, I just want them to know
how much I love you.

11:15.022 --> 11:17.589
And I don't mind that you're
carrying another man's child.

11:17.633 --> 11:20.549
Oh. You think that'll make 'em
see what a good guy you are?

11:20.592 --> 11:21.724
Maybe a little.

11:21.768 --> 11:22.943
And you'll look noble.

11:22.986 --> 11:24.596
Well, yeah.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.468
Question.

11:26.511 --> 11:29.776
Once I admit I got knocked up
by a completely different guy,

11:29.819 --> 11:31.560
how will I look?

11:33.780 --> 11:35.738
Yeah, okay.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.174
What's the plan?

11:37.218 --> 11:38.698
We don't speak a word of Junior

11:38.741 --> 11:40.438
until we're being pelted
with rice.

11:42.484 --> 11:44.747
Yeah, but what if you're showing
before the wedding?

11:44.791 --> 11:46.793
Don't you think people
will have questions?

11:47.794 --> 11:49.796
It's the one upside
to being a big girl.

11:49.839 --> 11:52.320
No one ever dares ask
if you're pregnant.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.323
[laughs]

12:03.461 --> 12:05.550
-[snoring]
-Miss Catherine...

12:05.594 --> 12:07.030
I'm going to run some errands.

12:07.074 --> 12:08.728
Do you need anything?

12:08.771 --> 12:10.773
[snores]

12:12.775 --> 12:15.430
[door opens, closes]

12:45.590 --> 12:46.766
Isabel.

13:15.969 --> 13:18.014
â™ª

13:29.852 --> 13:31.941
I work for Rita Castillo.

13:31.985 --> 13:33.813
My condolences.

13:33.856 --> 13:36.641
She called from jail, asked me
to get the photos you took.

13:36.685 --> 13:38.774
I figured as much.

13:38.818 --> 13:42.082
Here you go, 33 photos
and the negatives to boot.

13:42.125 --> 13:43.648
Thanks.

13:43.692 --> 13:45.085
There's something else.

13:46.477 --> 13:48.218
Always is with that dame.

13:48.262 --> 13:51.134
Mrs. Castillo needs you
to come see her in jail.

13:51.178 --> 13:52.570
Today.

13:53.571 --> 13:56.792
Still demanding,
even behind bars.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.489
She expects you there by 4:00.

14:02.580 --> 14:04.408
And for the record, Mr. Loomis,

14:04.452 --> 14:06.236
Rita Castillo is not a dame.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.195
She's a fucking lady.

14:09.152 --> 14:10.850
[door closes]

14:12.939 --> 14:17.465
I am sure it's all just
a horrible misunderstanding.

14:17.508 --> 14:19.859
I mean, Rita's no angel, but...

14:19.902 --> 14:22.078
[whispering]:
she's no killer either.

14:22.122 --> 14:24.428
She did tell us
Carlo is a brute.

14:24.472 --> 14:27.083
But when your husband
is that old, you don't kill him,

14:27.127 --> 14:28.911
you just wait.
[chuckles]

14:28.955 --> 14:30.913
But look who I'm telling.

14:30.957 --> 14:33.350
What are you implying?

14:33.394 --> 14:36.658
I adored my Edgar.

14:36.701 --> 14:39.356
And I miss him every day.

14:39.400 --> 14:43.056
[all laughing]

14:44.100 --> 14:45.232
Excuse me just a moment.

14:52.456 --> 14:54.850
-Oh. Excuse me.
-Thank you.

14:56.591 --> 14:58.985
-Alma.
-[gasps]

14:59.028 --> 15:01.552
-Ah, hello.
-Oh, Mavis.

15:01.596 --> 15:03.380
I love your hat.

15:03.424 --> 15:04.642
So chic.

15:04.686 --> 15:06.035
-Oh. Thank you.
-Hmm.

15:06.079 --> 15:07.689
How are you doing?

15:07.732 --> 15:09.125
Oh. I'm fine.

15:09.169 --> 15:10.518
Certainly better than Rita.

15:10.561 --> 15:11.823
I'm sure you've heard the news.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.477
What about Rita?

15:13.521 --> 15:16.045
You haven't seen the papers?
Rita's been arrested.

15:16.089 --> 15:17.568
For what?

15:17.612 --> 15:18.569
Drunk driving?

15:18.613 --> 15:19.962
For murder.

15:20.006 --> 15:22.269
They're saying
she poisoned Carlo.

15:22.312 --> 15:23.966
Oh.

15:24.010 --> 15:25.533
She actually
went through with it.

15:25.576 --> 15:26.621
What?

15:27.622 --> 15:28.666
Oh, I...

15:28.710 --> 15:29.929
I shouldn't have said that.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.018
Excuse me.

15:32.061 --> 15:33.149
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:33.193 --> 15:34.194
What have you heard?

15:34.237 --> 15:35.717
[sighs] Well...

15:35.760 --> 15:37.414
You know when you all came over,

15:37.458 --> 15:39.982
she and I spoke for quite
some time in the kitchen.

15:40.026 --> 15:41.723
Oh, I remember.

15:41.766 --> 15:43.333
We were in the other room
saying, "What is that about?"

15:43.377 --> 15:46.206
She confided in me
that she was having an affair

15:46.249 --> 15:48.121
and that Carlo was on to her.

15:48.164 --> 15:50.210
-[gasps]
-She was worried
that he might divorce her

15:50.253 --> 15:52.038
and-and leave her
without a dime.

15:52.081 --> 15:55.084
But then she said that
she had a plan to stop him.

15:55.128 --> 15:58.740
I didn't take it seriously
because she was so...

15:58.783 --> 16:01.134
drunk, but now I...

16:01.177 --> 16:02.962
-Oh.
-Divorce.

16:03.005 --> 16:05.529
-That would explain a lot.
-Yes.

16:05.573 --> 16:07.053
Please don't repeat this.

16:07.096 --> 16:09.359
I would hate
for word to get out.

16:09.403 --> 16:12.319
Everyone in town would think
that Rita is guilty.

16:12.362 --> 16:14.538
And who knows? I...

16:14.582 --> 16:15.931
Maybe I'm wrong.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.629
I will take it to my grave.

16:18.673 --> 16:19.935
Thank you.

16:19.979 --> 16:20.936
It's so lovely to see you,
Alma.

16:20.980 --> 16:21.937
You as well.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.547
Oh, have a wonderful day.

16:23.591 --> 16:25.462
-Yes, bye.
-Bye now.

16:29.466 --> 16:30.772
[sighs]

16:32.513 --> 16:36.299
I just saw Alma Fillcot
in the restroom.

16:36.343 --> 16:37.648
[chattering]

16:37.692 --> 16:38.606
Are you ladies ready
for the bill?

16:38.649 --> 16:40.042
Oh, no thank you, Joe.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.696
We have lots more to discuss.

16:41.739 --> 16:43.611
[indistinct chatter]

16:44.829 --> 16:46.048
...and he was going
to divorce her.

16:46.092 --> 16:48.137
[gasping]

16:49.878 --> 16:51.793
I know what you think of me,

16:51.836 --> 16:54.883
but I did not kill Carlo!

16:54.926 --> 16:56.711
Relax.

16:56.754 --> 16:57.973
I believe you.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.105
You do?

16:59.148 --> 17:00.628
But don't get me wrong,

17:00.671 --> 17:02.804
I think you're capable
of murder.

17:02.847 --> 17:04.675
But you'd hire some goon
to do it

17:04.719 --> 17:06.416
while you were on vacation.

17:06.460 --> 17:08.984
You wouldn't be upstairs
taking a nap.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.899
See.

17:10.942 --> 17:13.162
I know you, Rita.

17:13.206 --> 17:15.947
You may be evil,

17:15.991 --> 17:17.906
but you're not stupid.

17:17.949 --> 17:20.909
I'm sure there was a compliment
in there somewhere.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.087
So you'll help me?

17:25.131 --> 17:26.523
Maybe.

17:26.567 --> 17:28.395
I got to get permission first.

17:28.438 --> 17:29.439
From who?

17:29.483 --> 17:30.571
My girlfriend.

17:30.614 --> 17:32.877
What's she got to do with it?

17:32.921 --> 17:34.314
Long story.

17:34.357 --> 17:35.489
I'll tell you sometime.

17:35.532 --> 17:37.534
You might even laugh about it.

17:39.928 --> 17:42.061
But probably not.

17:42.104 --> 17:43.975
[door closes]

17:46.587 --> 17:48.806
I spoke to Rita today.

17:49.807 --> 17:51.157
What did she have to say?

17:51.200 --> 17:52.593
She wants you to call the judge

17:52.636 --> 17:54.986
and tell him to give her bail,
or else.

17:56.118 --> 17:58.338
She's threatening me? With what?

18:00.340 --> 18:02.516
-This.
-[groans]

18:06.824 --> 18:09.566
I assume your photographer
took several of these.

18:11.525 --> 18:13.918
Did he get any
from a better angle?

18:13.962 --> 18:16.660
My breasts are much more
impressive than that.

18:16.704 --> 18:18.488
[scoffs] This is no bluff.

18:18.532 --> 18:20.490
We'll send copies
to everyone in Texas.

18:20.534 --> 18:22.579
You won't be able to show
your face there again.

18:24.407 --> 18:25.887
That would be awkward.

18:25.930 --> 18:28.890
Luckily, I have no intention
of going back.

18:28.933 --> 18:30.109
What?

18:30.152 --> 18:31.806
I prefer it here.

18:31.849 --> 18:35.984
You know, I have a bigger house,
nicer weather, a lover.

18:36.027 --> 18:38.508
I had a picture
of him somewhere.

18:38.552 --> 18:40.031
Oh, right. [chuckles]

18:40.075 --> 18:41.772
Here it is.

18:41.816 --> 18:45.167
The only thing I didn't like
about California was Rita.

18:45.211 --> 18:46.995
But now that she
has different accommodations...

18:47.952 --> 18:50.041
But-but you love Texas.

18:50.085 --> 18:51.608
You lived there
your whole life.

18:51.652 --> 18:55.264
I'm not as sentimental
about the past as some.

18:55.308 --> 18:57.614
Take you, for instance.

18:59.094 --> 19:02.532
Holding on
to all these old letters

19:02.576 --> 19:04.404
that Rita wrote you years ago.

19:04.447 --> 19:06.057
How did you get those?

19:09.235 --> 19:11.541
"Relax, Isabel.

19:11.585 --> 19:13.848
"No one's found
Harry's body yet,

19:13.891 --> 19:16.764
and we're never going back
to Galveston."

19:16.807 --> 19:19.201
[chuckles] I don't know

19:19.245 --> 19:21.638
which Harry
from Galveston this is,

19:21.682 --> 19:23.162
but I intend to find out.

19:23.205 --> 19:25.860
So, in answer to your question,

19:25.903 --> 19:29.168
no, I won't get Rita
out of jail.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.953
And if you continue
talking to Rita,

19:31.996 --> 19:33.955
I will put you in there
with her.

19:35.826 --> 19:37.611
You're an evil bitch.
You know that?

19:37.654 --> 19:41.092
Well, you can't blackmail me.

19:41.136 --> 19:43.747
Because I quit.

19:43.791 --> 19:46.315
Isabel, before you go...

19:47.882 --> 19:49.362
One more cup?

19:49.405 --> 19:51.364
For old times' sake?

20:04.725 --> 20:07.467
Scooter, I don't know
what I'm doing here.

20:07.510 --> 20:09.338
I did not kill Carlo.

20:09.382 --> 20:10.644
I know.

20:10.687 --> 20:12.907
Someone must have framed you!

20:13.908 --> 20:15.866
No, I wasn't just saying that
for the guards.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.346
I really am innocent.

20:17.390 --> 20:19.740
Then what was that poison
doing in your purse?

20:20.915 --> 20:22.786
What?

20:22.830 --> 20:24.223
How did you know about that?

20:24.266 --> 20:25.876
It wasn't in the papers.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.226
Catherine told me.

20:27.269 --> 20:28.749
She's still speaking to you?

20:28.792 --> 20:30.141
Why wouldn't she be?

20:30.185 --> 20:31.621
Well, I told you
to stop kissing her

20:31.665 --> 20:33.057
once Vern got the photo.

20:33.101 --> 20:35.799
Most women would be offended

20:35.843 --> 20:37.497
by a man pulling away mid-tryst.

20:39.281 --> 20:42.023
Well... that was the plan.

20:42.066 --> 20:44.460
But, well...

20:44.504 --> 20:46.506
-once we got going...
-Wait.

20:47.985 --> 20:50.249
You actually...

20:50.292 --> 20:51.859
fucked her?

20:51.902 --> 20:53.426
Well, at least
I kept her distracted

20:53.469 --> 20:56.037
while you were doing...
whatever.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.821
I did not murder Carlo!

20:58.996 --> 21:00.520
Of course you didn't!

21:00.563 --> 21:03.479
I am very angry
with you right now.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.395
Well, then maybe
I should lay low for a while.

21:06.439 --> 21:08.528
You know, some folks
might consider me a motive.

21:08.571 --> 21:10.399
Are you dumping me?

21:10.443 --> 21:13.097
I-I'm just saying
no more visits in jail.

21:13.141 --> 21:15.622
It makes you look guilty.

21:15.665 --> 21:17.319
And...

21:17.363 --> 21:18.625
maybe me, too.

21:18.668 --> 21:20.279
Maybe.

21:21.671 --> 21:22.890
-Guard.
-Wait.

21:22.933 --> 21:24.152
Scooter.

21:24.195 --> 21:25.501
Please don't go.

21:26.459 --> 21:28.287
I'm sorry.

21:29.462 --> 21:30.941
Bye, Aunt Rita.

21:36.164 --> 21:38.601
[sighs]
I know I said 7:30.

21:38.645 --> 21:40.342
Maybe the traffic's bad.

21:40.386 --> 21:41.909
Etiquette experts say

21:41.952 --> 21:43.780
that you shouldn't be
right on time for dinner.

21:43.824 --> 21:45.347
The hostess
might be running behind.

21:45.391 --> 21:47.218
It's polite to be a bit late.

21:47.262 --> 21:49.177
He's not usually this polite.

21:49.220 --> 21:51.135
[doorbell rings]

21:53.529 --> 21:55.270
Oh, thank God.
I was getting worried.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.576
Sorry.

21:56.619 --> 21:58.273
I was working on a new case.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.927
Mom, Dad, this is Vern.

21:59.970 --> 22:01.232
-Hello.
-It's nice to meet you both.

22:01.276 --> 22:02.277
Bertram Fillcot. How are you?

22:02.321 --> 22:03.583
Dee said you liked flowers.

22:03.626 --> 22:05.367
Oh, what lovely blooms.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.630
-Not as pretty as your garden.
-Oh, well...

22:07.674 --> 22:09.284
Flattery will get you
everywhere.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.155
Please, come in, sit down.

22:11.199 --> 22:13.723
Now, I heard you mention to Dee
something about a new case.

22:13.767 --> 22:15.508
What exactly
do you do for a living?

22:15.551 --> 22:17.248
He's a detective.

22:18.380 --> 22:19.686
Oh.

22:19.729 --> 22:20.687
Mom, are you all right?

22:20.730 --> 22:21.905
Yes.

22:21.949 --> 22:23.994
Yes. It's just a little thorn.

22:24.995 --> 22:26.170
Are you with the police?

22:26.214 --> 22:28.129
I used to be, before the war.

22:28.172 --> 22:29.478
Now I'm a private detective.

22:29.522 --> 22:31.175
Oh, a private detective.

22:31.219 --> 22:32.916
Oh, that's much better.

22:34.135 --> 22:35.919
I mean,
it's so much more exciting.

22:35.963 --> 22:37.530
Not too exciting.

22:37.573 --> 22:39.836
Mostly I work missing
persons cases, divorces.

22:39.880 --> 22:41.447
It's how me met.

22:41.490 --> 22:43.492
Vern came into the diner
'cause he was tailing a guy.

22:43.536 --> 22:46.539
Next thing I knew,
I was tailing your daughter.

22:49.455 --> 22:50.804
That sounded creepy, huh?

22:50.847 --> 22:52.153
Yes, a little bit.

22:52.196 --> 22:53.894
I'm going to put these in water.

22:53.937 --> 22:55.635
Bertram, will you help me
in the kitchen?

22:55.678 --> 22:57.158
Yes.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.901
So far, so good.

23:00.944 --> 23:02.511
Hey. What's this new case?

23:02.555 --> 23:04.295
About that...

23:04.339 --> 23:07.560
if I decide to take it,
the fee could buy us a house.

23:07.603 --> 23:08.604
A house?

23:08.648 --> 23:10.563
My God, who's the client?

23:10.606 --> 23:12.173
Well...

23:12.216 --> 23:13.348
ALMA:
Dinner is served!

23:13.392 --> 23:15.742
Thank God. I am starved.

23:15.785 --> 23:18.179
Why aren't you telling me
who the client is?

23:18.222 --> 23:20.355
[stammers] It's a long story.
I'll tell you later.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.704
You might even laugh about it.

23:22.575 --> 23:24.577
But probably not.

23:27.188 --> 23:29.233
[indistinct chatter
and laughter]

23:39.418 --> 23:40.767
We need more rolls.

23:40.810 --> 23:42.203
Just taking a batch
out of the oven.

23:42.246 --> 23:43.683
Put the basket right here.

23:46.468 --> 23:49.036
So?
What do you think about Vern?

23:49.079 --> 23:50.994
I like him.

23:51.038 --> 23:52.692
Such lovely manners.

23:52.735 --> 23:55.085
And the blooms he brought
were well chosen.

23:55.129 --> 23:56.391
Most men haven't a clue.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.784
So, you really like him?

23:57.827 --> 23:59.394
You're not just saying that?

24:00.395 --> 24:01.918
I really like him.

24:03.267 --> 24:06.575
And I hope you'll have
a nice, long engagement.

24:06.619 --> 24:09.230
It'll give your father and I
a chance to get to know him.

24:09.273 --> 24:10.971
Actually...

24:11.014 --> 24:12.929
we wanted to get married
as soon as possible.

24:12.973 --> 24:14.627
[chuckles]

24:14.670 --> 24:16.411
This is marriage, Dee.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.674
It's not something
you just jump into.

24:18.718 --> 24:20.110
Yeah, but...

24:20.154 --> 24:21.590
Dee.

24:21.634 --> 24:23.505
He's not going anywhere.

24:23.549 --> 24:25.159
What's the rush?

24:28.336 --> 24:30.381
BERTRAM:
So, you met Dee at the diner.

24:30.425 --> 24:31.818
Do you, do you live near there?

24:31.861 --> 24:33.733
I have a little place downtown.

24:33.776 --> 24:36.475
But he just got a case so big,
it could buy us a house.

24:36.518 --> 24:37.650
Oh, wonderful.

24:37.693 --> 24:39.042
Who's the client?

24:39.086 --> 24:40.522
-It's too soon to talk about it.
-Oh.

24:40.566 --> 24:42.132
Sounds top secret.

24:42.176 --> 24:43.351
I'll bet it's a movie star.

24:43.394 --> 24:44.874
[chuckles]
No.

24:44.918 --> 24:47.224
No, but you'd earn enough
money to buy a house?

24:47.268 --> 24:49.052
Rich people pay a lot
to get out of jams.

24:49.096 --> 24:51.402
Oh, so it's a rich person
in a jam...

24:51.446 --> 24:53.361
That sounds like a little bit
of a clue, doesn't it?

24:53.404 --> 24:54.623
Hmm.

24:54.667 --> 24:55.972
Is it Rita Castillo?

24:56.016 --> 24:58.018
Uh...

24:59.585 --> 25:00.673
Oh, my God.

25:00.716 --> 25:01.935
It is Rita, isn't it?

25:01.978 --> 25:03.545
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

25:03.589 --> 25:05.329
Why would you work
for her again?

25:05.373 --> 25:06.505
Again?

25:06.548 --> 25:08.115
You've worked for Rita before?

25:08.158 --> 25:09.725
I'm sorry, Mrs. Fillcot.

25:09.769 --> 25:11.335
I know you hate Rita's guts.

25:11.379 --> 25:12.423
What?

25:12.467 --> 25:13.686
[laughing]:
What?

25:13.729 --> 25:14.948
Vern...

25:14.991 --> 25:17.559
Why would you say such a thing?

25:17.603 --> 25:19.343
Well, Dee told me
about your history with Rita.

25:19.387 --> 25:21.302
How she blackballed you
from her Garden Club.

25:21.345 --> 25:22.651
She blackballed you?

25:22.695 --> 25:24.348
And she got me fired
from my job.

25:24.392 --> 25:25.828
VERN:
I don't care for her either.

25:25.872 --> 25:27.526
But she swears
she didn't kill her husband.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.092
She said she was framed.

25:29.136 --> 25:30.137
BERTRAM:
I-I-I'm sorry.

25:30.180 --> 25:31.747
What do you mean framed?

25:31.791 --> 25:33.532
The drug
that killed her husband?

25:33.575 --> 25:35.838
They found a syringe full of it
in her purse.

25:35.882 --> 25:37.361
Huh.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.496
Such morbid talk
for the dinner table.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.194
I hope that when I come back
with dessert,

25:44.238 --> 25:45.544
we can change the subject.

25:51.114 --> 25:55.205
She found my letters?

25:55.249 --> 25:56.206
How?

25:56.250 --> 25:57.512
How do you think?

25:57.556 --> 25:59.296
Catherine broke into my room.

25:59.340 --> 26:02.125
I told you to destroy those
years ago.

26:02.169 --> 26:03.779
Why did you keep them?

26:03.823 --> 26:06.608
You know, for the memories.

26:08.001 --> 26:10.699
You kept them for insurance.

26:10.743 --> 26:12.658
You were scared
I wouldn't give you the money

26:12.701 --> 26:14.398
I promised when Carlo died.

26:14.442 --> 26:16.052
You didn't trust me.

26:16.096 --> 26:17.619
How could I?

26:17.663 --> 26:20.100
You lie all the time.

26:20.143 --> 26:22.276
To your husband, your lovers,

26:22.319 --> 26:23.625
to everyone.

26:23.669 --> 26:25.366
If Catherine has the letters,

26:25.409 --> 26:27.934
how long before she finds out
what we did in Galveston?

26:27.977 --> 26:29.370
You, you have ruined us.

26:29.413 --> 26:30.719
Us?

26:30.763 --> 26:32.242
You're the one
with poison in her purse.

26:32.286 --> 26:33.635
How many times do I have
to tell you I was framed?

26:33.679 --> 26:35.202
[scoffs]

26:37.813 --> 26:39.946
Any theories on who would
have done something like that?

26:41.164 --> 26:42.644
So that's your next move.

26:42.688 --> 26:44.515
You're going to try
to pin this on me?

26:44.559 --> 26:46.909
All I know is I didn't do it.

26:46.953 --> 26:48.563
Well, neither did I.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.086
And you know what?

26:50.130 --> 26:52.001
I ain't sticking around
to find out who did.

26:52.045 --> 26:53.699
Meaning what?

26:53.742 --> 26:56.353
Tomorrow I'm buying
a bus ticket for parts unknown.

26:56.397 --> 26:59.835
What, you're just going
to leave me here to rot?

26:59.879 --> 27:01.228
Catherine's on to us.

27:01.271 --> 27:02.751
I got to get the hell
out of Dodge.

27:02.795 --> 27:04.535
The ingratitude.

27:04.579 --> 27:06.842
I gave you a home, a job.

27:06.886 --> 27:09.671
A job as a maid.

27:09.715 --> 27:11.151
We're blood.

27:11.194 --> 27:13.588
And somewhere along the way,
you forgot that.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.459
Well, I quit.

27:15.503 --> 27:18.245
This is one mess you're going
to have to clean up yourself.

27:22.249 --> 27:24.338
[door closes]

27:24.381 --> 27:26.383
You said that Rita
was your friend.

27:26.427 --> 27:27.820
That she wanted you in the club.

27:27.863 --> 27:29.996
That's what she said,
but she lied.

27:30.039 --> 27:31.737
Is this why you asked me
to kill Carlo?

27:31.780 --> 27:33.303
Now is not the time.

27:33.347 --> 27:37.917
Alma, did you put that syringe
in her purse?

27:37.960 --> 27:40.746
What I did or didn't do
doesn't matter at this point.

27:40.789 --> 27:43.749
What matters is that Dee
is engaged to a man

27:43.792 --> 27:45.576
who wants to prove
Rita is innocent.

27:45.620 --> 27:46.708
But she is innocent.

27:46.752 --> 27:48.014
And we are not.

27:48.057 --> 27:49.145
See the problem?

27:49.189 --> 27:50.494
You deceived me.

27:50.538 --> 27:52.105
You used me as a murder weapon.

27:52.148 --> 27:53.933
Stop whining.

27:53.976 --> 27:55.586
-Get the ice cream.
-[scoffs]

27:56.196 --> 27:59.025
How can you work for Rita after
all she's done to this family?

27:59.068 --> 28:01.941
Well, helping us buy a house
is a nice way to apologize.

28:01.984 --> 28:04.291
God, this night is a disaster.

28:04.334 --> 28:05.727
I know, it's awkward.

28:05.771 --> 28:07.729
But we have to think
about our future

28:07.773 --> 28:09.644
and the home
we want to make for the baby.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.385
Baby?

28:11.428 --> 28:12.821
Oh, boy.

28:12.865 --> 28:15.041
Dee, do you mean to say that...?

28:16.129 --> 28:17.826
Yeah.

28:17.870 --> 28:19.436
I'm pregnant.

28:19.480 --> 28:20.699
-[gasps]
-What?

28:20.742 --> 28:21.743
It's not mine.

28:21.787 --> 28:23.136
[gasping]

28:25.878 --> 28:27.096
Yeah.

28:27.140 --> 28:28.663
That made it less awkward.

28:35.757 --> 28:37.759
[dishes clanking]

28:39.500 --> 28:41.154
Thank you, Vern.

28:41.197 --> 28:43.460
Just put those on the counter,
please.

28:50.859 --> 28:52.774
For what it's worth,

28:52.818 --> 28:55.777
I'm sorry you had to find out
about the baby like that.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.910
We should've told you sooner.

29:00.651 --> 29:02.653
And you don't have to worry.

29:02.697 --> 29:05.744
I plan to take good care
of Dee and the baby.

29:08.834 --> 29:10.487
But I do worry.

29:10.531 --> 29:12.707
[sighs]
Mostly about your job.

29:14.709 --> 29:16.102
My job?

29:16.145 --> 29:18.844
Well, you're
a private detective.

29:18.887 --> 29:20.846
That's dangerous work.

29:20.889 --> 29:23.500
Dee could end up a widow
before her first anniversary.

29:23.544 --> 29:25.154
[chuckling]:
Oh, no.

29:25.198 --> 29:27.113
It's not what it seems like
in the movies.

29:28.070 --> 29:30.856
Don't you investigate
people's secrets?

29:30.899 --> 29:33.641
Expose things they're
desperate to keep hidden?

29:33.684 --> 29:35.164
I guess.

29:36.557 --> 29:38.385
And I assume you carry a gun.

29:38.428 --> 29:39.952
When it's necessary.

29:39.995 --> 29:41.431
So you admit it?

29:41.475 --> 29:42.824
There's risk.

29:43.869 --> 29:46.219
I am not going
to get myself killed.

29:46.262 --> 29:47.916
That's what they all say.

29:49.352 --> 29:52.921
Mrs. Fillcot, being a P.I.
is, is how I make my living.

29:52.965 --> 29:55.315
Why not drive a taxi?

29:55.358 --> 29:56.925
Or work in a factory?

29:56.969 --> 30:00.494
There are safer ways
to bring home a paycheck.

30:01.495 --> 30:02.931
Are you asking me
to quit my job?

30:02.975 --> 30:05.107
Oh, Vern.

30:05.151 --> 30:06.587
You're asking me

30:06.630 --> 30:09.329
to bless this hasty union
with my daughter.

30:09.372 --> 30:11.940
And she's pregnant
with another man's child?

30:11.984 --> 30:13.942
[scoffs]

30:13.986 --> 30:17.206
A little compromise makes
for happier families.

30:18.425 --> 30:20.253
Don't you agree?

30:28.130 --> 30:30.393
Thank you for coming by.

30:30.437 --> 30:32.874
-You sounded upset on the phone.
-I am.

30:32.918 --> 30:35.094
Something unpleasant
came to my attention.

30:35.137 --> 30:37.270
It involves Rita and me...

30:37.313 --> 30:39.402
and you as well.

30:40.664 --> 30:41.840
Me?

30:41.883 --> 30:44.320
The night Papa died,

30:44.364 --> 30:46.888
when we came back here and...
you know.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.368
What about it?

30:48.411 --> 30:51.197
It appears there were
photographs taken.

30:53.547 --> 30:55.114
Of us.

30:55.157 --> 30:56.463
Undressed.

30:56.506 --> 30:58.508
Listen, uh,
about those photos...

30:58.552 --> 31:00.336
You knew about them?

31:00.380 --> 31:01.685
Well, yeah.

31:01.729 --> 31:02.991
When Rita came to me, I...

31:03.035 --> 31:05.428
She tried to blackmail you, too?

31:07.343 --> 31:09.389
She sure did.

31:09.432 --> 31:11.217
I'm so sorry.

31:11.260 --> 31:13.088
I didn't know
she had us followed.

31:13.132 --> 31:15.177
She's sneaky, that one.

31:15.221 --> 31:16.918
No, she's hateful.

31:16.962 --> 31:18.964
You know,
one thing is to attack me,

31:19.007 --> 31:21.923
but to drag an innocent young
man into her vendetta...

31:21.967 --> 31:23.229
Eh.

31:23.272 --> 31:24.708
What ya gonna do?

31:24.752 --> 31:27.668
So, do you really think
she killed Carlo?

31:27.711 --> 31:30.410
Well, if not her, then who?

31:30.453 --> 31:32.368
That's what I keep wondering.

31:34.022 --> 31:38.287
So... you're not angry at me?

31:38.331 --> 31:39.462
At you?

31:39.506 --> 31:41.421
No. We're golden.

31:41.464 --> 31:43.379
Oh.

31:43.423 --> 31:45.468
I'm so glad.

31:45.512 --> 31:47.731
You know, our maid quit today.

31:47.775 --> 31:50.734
And with Papa gone
and Rita in jail...

31:51.735 --> 31:54.260
I'm going to be all by myself
in this cold,

31:54.303 --> 31:56.349
empty house.

31:56.392 --> 31:58.133
And I wouldn't mind it so much

31:58.177 --> 31:59.743
if you were here

31:59.787 --> 32:01.789
to keep me company.

32:03.138 --> 32:05.271
Are you asking me to move in?

32:05.314 --> 32:06.750
Here?

32:06.794 --> 32:09.753
I need a reason to get up
in the mornings.

32:10.624 --> 32:14.193
And it would be very nice
to have someone to take care of.

32:17.718 --> 32:19.720
Well...

32:19.763 --> 32:22.462
I sure wouldn't
want you to be lonely.

32:22.505 --> 32:23.724
Oh.

32:23.767 --> 32:27.032
Thank you, my darling boy.

32:29.034 --> 32:30.992
Hey, you're cold.

32:31.036 --> 32:32.385
Let me start you a fire.

32:32.428 --> 32:34.343
Oh, Scooter.

32:34.387 --> 32:35.954
You already have.

32:37.781 --> 32:39.087
-DEE: Thanks, Mom.
-VERN: Thank you.
-Night.

32:39.131 --> 32:41.350
-Of course. Drive safely.
-Take care.

32:42.482 --> 32:43.874
[Vern exhales sharply]

32:43.918 --> 32:45.572
Saw you talking to my mom
in the kitchen.

32:45.615 --> 32:47.095
What was that all about?

32:48.140 --> 32:49.793
She wants me
to stop being a detective.

32:49.837 --> 32:51.230
What?

32:51.273 --> 32:53.493
She's worried I'll get shot
by a crook,

32:53.536 --> 32:54.755
and you'll be a widow.

32:54.798 --> 32:56.757
Oh, geez.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.325
So, what does she think
you'll do for a living?

32:59.368 --> 33:02.806
-She suggested I drive a taxi.
-Hmm.

33:03.807 --> 33:06.201
I'd rather sleep
with a private detective.

33:06.245 --> 33:07.724
Well...

33:07.768 --> 33:09.117
that settles that.

33:09.161 --> 33:11.206
[both laughing]

33:13.643 --> 33:16.081
You know, it... it's funny.

33:16.124 --> 33:18.126
Your mom didn't seem
to mind my job at first.

33:18.170 --> 33:19.910
Yeah.

33:19.954 --> 33:21.956
She only got weird when
you said you might help Rita.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.480
Considering what Rita did
to you and your mom,

33:24.524 --> 33:26.265
maybe I shouldn't take the case.

33:26.308 --> 33:28.832
Do you think Rita is innocent?

33:28.876 --> 33:30.747
I do.

33:32.271 --> 33:33.620
Then take the job.

33:33.663 --> 33:35.317
Are you sure?

33:35.361 --> 33:37.537
We got a baby on the way.

33:37.580 --> 33:40.453
And if Rita's willing
to pay top dollar...

33:40.496 --> 33:42.411
But what about your mom?

33:42.455 --> 33:44.761
I want her to like me.

33:44.805 --> 33:46.111
Honey.

33:46.154 --> 33:48.591
She's going to be
your mother-in-law.

33:48.635 --> 33:49.984
She will never like you.

33:56.382 --> 33:58.340
This evening was certainly
full of surprises.

33:58.384 --> 34:00.125
Don't you think?

34:02.866 --> 34:04.390
Are you going to sulk all night?

34:05.652 --> 34:07.654
You trick me into killing
Rita's husband.

34:07.697 --> 34:10.352
Then you have the nerve
to complain that I'm sulking?

34:11.571 --> 34:13.094
Why, Alma?

34:13.138 --> 34:14.574
Why did you do it?

34:15.662 --> 34:17.185
I told you.

34:17.229 --> 34:18.839
Rita was cruel to me.

34:18.882 --> 34:21.233
[scoffs] There's got to be
more to it than that.

34:22.364 --> 34:25.411
When you're able to explain
your shocking conduct,

34:25.454 --> 34:27.152
come down to the sofa.

34:27.195 --> 34:28.805
Explain it to me there.

34:28.849 --> 34:31.069
That's where
I'll be sleeping tonight.

34:56.355 --> 34:58.400
Mr. Loomis?

34:58.444 --> 34:59.967
It's 6:00 in the morning.

35:00.010 --> 35:01.229
What are you doing here
so early?

35:01.273 --> 35:03.405
I owe you one, Frank.

35:03.449 --> 35:06.147
-You got five minutes.
-That's all I need.

35:06.191 --> 35:08.018
I'm going to take your case.

35:08.062 --> 35:10.586
Wonderful.

35:10.630 --> 35:12.414
I didn't think you would.

35:12.458 --> 35:14.199
I know you don't think
much of me.

35:14.242 --> 35:16.288
I don't got to like you
to think you're innocent.

35:16.331 --> 35:17.767
Thank you.

35:17.811 --> 35:19.421
So...

35:19.465 --> 35:21.902
I'm going to need a list
of all your enemies.

35:21.945 --> 35:23.512
All of 'em?

35:24.600 --> 35:26.124
Oh, honey.

35:27.168 --> 35:29.039
You're going to need
more than five minutes.

35:35.959 --> 35:38.005
[doorbell rings]

35:40.964 --> 35:43.358
Hi.
Oh, I hope it's not too early.

35:43.402 --> 35:44.620
Not at all.

35:44.664 --> 35:45.839
May I come in?

35:45.882 --> 35:47.406
Oh, uh...

35:47.449 --> 35:49.059
-My house is a mess.
-Oh.

35:49.103 --> 35:51.366
-Let's, let's talk out here.
-Oh, all right.

35:51.410 --> 35:53.368
[clears throat]

35:53.412 --> 35:55.805
-[chuckles nervously]
-Oh, Alma.

35:55.849 --> 35:57.459
I just...

35:57.503 --> 36:00.767
I wanted you to know
the whole club feels terribly

36:00.810 --> 36:03.117
about the way Rita treated you.

36:03.161 --> 36:06.686
Promising you a spot and then
stabbing you in the back.

36:06.729 --> 36:08.905
I'm sure she had her reasons.

36:08.949 --> 36:10.298
Be that as it may,

36:10.342 --> 36:12.996
there may be room
for a new member soon.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.476
Oh?

36:14.520 --> 36:16.957
Now, Rita is innocent
until proven guilty.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.393
But...

36:18.437 --> 36:20.482
this whole scandal
is just so salacious

36:20.526 --> 36:23.224
that some of the ladies
want her out right now.

36:23.268 --> 36:24.791
Oh.

36:24.834 --> 36:26.445
Oh, poor Rita.

36:26.488 --> 36:28.490
That is so like you, Alma.

36:28.534 --> 36:31.014
Defending her, even now.

36:31.058 --> 36:32.712
Well...

36:32.755 --> 36:35.497
Well, if she is removed,

36:35.541 --> 36:37.934
I plan to nominate you again.

36:37.978 --> 36:40.589
And this time
I won't fail to get those votes.

36:40.633 --> 36:42.330
That is...

36:42.374 --> 36:45.203
if you'd still want
to be a part of our silly club.

36:45.246 --> 36:46.552
I do.

36:46.595 --> 36:48.380
I really do.

36:48.423 --> 36:50.251
Oh, good.

36:50.295 --> 36:51.731
Well, I'll let you know

36:51.774 --> 36:53.559
as soon as we make a decision
about Rita.

36:53.602 --> 36:55.430
You're so kind
to think of me, Grace.

36:55.474 --> 36:57.650
Well, someone has to think
of you, Alma.

36:57.693 --> 36:59.042
You never think of yourself.

36:59.086 --> 37:00.043
Well...

37:00.087 --> 37:01.567
[both sigh]

37:01.610 --> 37:03.482
[both giggle]

37:12.317 --> 37:13.753
Oh.

37:13.796 --> 37:15.233
You're up.

37:15.276 --> 37:16.451
That was Grace.

37:16.495 --> 37:18.845
-She told me...
-I heard.

37:20.063 --> 37:21.761
You don't seem
very happy for me.

37:21.804 --> 37:23.502
That was the plan
all along, wasn't it?

37:23.545 --> 37:25.155
Why a man is dead

37:25.199 --> 37:27.157
and his wife is in jail
for murder.

37:27.201 --> 37:29.247
All so you could
get into a garden club?

37:30.291 --> 37:32.119
I don't pretend to be perfect.

37:32.162 --> 37:33.425
Jesus, Alma.

37:33.468 --> 37:36.254
Bertie... remind me.

37:36.297 --> 37:38.386
Why did you kill
all those people?

37:38.430 --> 37:40.780
I have told you a hundred times,

37:40.823 --> 37:43.391
they were suffering
from disease.

37:43.435 --> 37:45.480
And because you couldn't cure
the disease,

37:45.524 --> 37:47.047
you killed the patient.

37:47.090 --> 37:48.309
In order to protect them.

37:49.354 --> 37:50.790
What if you had the cure?

37:51.791 --> 37:54.141
What if you could have kept
the patient alive?

37:54.184 --> 37:55.577
What are you talking about?

37:55.621 --> 37:58.667
Rita was my disease.

37:58.711 --> 38:00.626
She was a tumor,

38:00.669 --> 38:02.976
causing me no end of pain,

38:03.019 --> 38:04.804
agony.

38:05.805 --> 38:07.459
So I had her removed.

38:07.502 --> 38:09.156
It's not the same thing.

38:09.199 --> 38:12.333
There's so much suffering
in the world.

38:12.377 --> 38:15.510
Because of cruelty
and unkindness.

38:15.554 --> 38:18.339
Rich, beautiful people
with power,

38:18.383 --> 38:21.690
humiliating weak nobodies
who displease them.

38:23.431 --> 38:25.259
Rita thought I was weak.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.043
And so did I.

38:27.087 --> 38:28.654
But you...

38:29.872 --> 38:32.832
...you taught me
that we all have power.

38:32.875 --> 38:35.704
If only we're brave enough
to use it.

38:36.705 --> 38:38.490
Alma, you framed
an innocent woman

38:38.533 --> 38:40.056
for a murder she didn't commit.

38:40.100 --> 38:42.668
I prevented suffering.

38:42.711 --> 38:45.235
That's how you justify
your crimes.

38:45.279 --> 38:47.586
I can justify mine
in exactly the same way.

38:47.629 --> 38:49.457
You've lost your mind.

38:54.897 --> 38:56.812
We're about to be grandparents.

38:56.856 --> 38:59.815
Let's just put all this
unpleasantness behind us

38:59.859 --> 39:01.643
and enjoy this happy time.

39:01.687 --> 39:03.166
Hmm?

39:19.792 --> 39:21.576
Here you go.

39:24.274 --> 39:25.928
How many days are you with us?

39:25.972 --> 39:27.321
Just the night.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.888
I'm taking the noon bus
out of town.

39:28.931 --> 39:31.281
Okay. Well, I'll get the towels.

39:34.197 --> 39:35.938
[sighs]

39:38.245 --> 39:39.942
Oh.

39:53.565 --> 39:56.176
â™ª

40:11.670 --> 40:13.411
[knock on door]

40:16.501 --> 40:17.850
Here's your towels.

40:19.242 --> 40:20.940
I may need a few more.

40:20.983 --> 40:23.856
I just decided to stay in town
a couple more days.

40:23.899 --> 40:25.597
Oh? What changed your mind?

40:25.640 --> 40:30.645
A promising business opportunity
has just presented itself.
