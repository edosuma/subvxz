00:22.187 --> 00:24.105
Oliver?

00:27.583 --> 00:29.910
What happened to...

00:29.935 --> 00:32.275
- Did they hurt you?
- No, I'm all right.

00:32.277 --> 00:33.609
How are you feeling?

00:33.611 --> 00:35.244
How am I feeling?

00:38.938 --> 00:40.637
Not good.

00:41.958 --> 00:44.839
It's morning. They must've drugged us.

00:53.129 --> 00:54.992
- No, don't!
- Aah!

00:58.278 --> 00:59.738
What is this?

01:00.324 --> 01:01.756
It's a prison.

01:01.781 --> 01:03.277
And we're trapped.

01:11.847 --> 01:13.518
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:13.543 --> 01:16.362
Did you know that
dinosaurs had feathers?

01:16.387 --> 01:18.520
No, but that's a cool fact, buddy.

01:18.545 --> 01:20.284
Zander,

01:21.240 --> 01:24.026
- let Mommy's friend sleep.
- Okay.

01:24.028 --> 01:25.785
Go brush your teeth for school.

01:25.824 --> 01:27.050
Bye.

01:29.834 --> 01:31.418
You have a kid.

01:32.199 --> 01:33.869
How did I not know you have a kid?

01:33.871 --> 01:36.760
Do you remember showing up
here at three in the morning?

01:36.785 --> 01:39.324
You were wasted, and you
wanted to keep partying.

01:39.371 --> 01:41.004
I would've sent you
home, but I wasn't sure

01:41.006 --> 01:42.289
you were gonna make it.

01:42.314 --> 01:43.546
I'm sorry.

01:43.548 --> 01:46.436
The drinking, the drugs,

01:46.631 --> 01:48.418
that's not a regular thing for me.

01:48.420 --> 01:50.835
Look, I don't want you to think
that this is what I do all the time.

01:50.859 --> 01:53.287
We can't see each other anymore.

01:55.229 --> 01:56.795
I'm sorry.

02:05.650 --> 02:07.121
Good morning.

02:16.493 --> 02:19.148
What in the hell are you doing
here at this hour of the morning?

02:19.595 --> 02:21.095
More importantly, what
the hell am I doing here?

02:21.119 --> 02:22.642
Listen to this,

02:22.644 --> 02:24.634
there were some hard
drives in the copy store

02:24.659 --> 02:26.469
that belonged to Sandstorm's fixer.

02:26.494 --> 02:28.164
Now, they were mostly destroyed,

02:28.189 --> 02:30.689
but I was able to recover
data from one of them.

02:30.691 --> 02:32.321
Look...

02:32.953 --> 02:36.266
it's full of passports and
other forgeries for Shepherd...

02:36.291 --> 02:37.507
dozens of them.

02:37.532 --> 02:40.394
I mean, she traveled extensively
under numerous aliases.

02:40.419 --> 02:41.918
It's... it's gonna take me a while

02:41.920 --> 02:43.427
to map out all of her movements.

02:43.452 --> 02:45.311
But so far...

02:45.336 --> 02:48.188
there was only one
fake passport for Roman.

02:48.190 --> 02:50.090
And travel documents
indicate that Shepherd

02:50.092 --> 02:52.546
- took Roman on a trip with her.
- So it must have been important.

02:52.570 --> 02:54.412
They went to the
Bahamas a few years back.

02:54.437 --> 02:56.131
There and back in just one day.

02:56.156 --> 02:57.922
Roman was only on the
ground for four hours.

02:57.947 --> 03:00.641
Security cameras caught
him going into a bank.

03:00.666 --> 03:03.180
There's a lot of dodgy banking
that goes on in the Bahamas...

03:03.205 --> 03:04.804
you figured out what he was doing there?

03:04.806 --> 03:07.040
Not exactly, their
privacy laws are strict.

03:07.042 --> 03:08.942
But there's an insurance log

03:08.967 --> 03:11.116
that monitors how much
money is in the bank

03:11.141 --> 03:12.422
at any given time.

03:12.447 --> 03:14.748
And during the time
Roman was inside the bank,

03:14.773 --> 03:18.638
$33 million was emptied
out of a trust fund.

03:18.678 --> 03:20.420
"Beneficiary deceased."

03:20.422 --> 03:22.322
So, what? You thinking
Roman killed someone

03:22.324 --> 03:23.823
to access to their money?

03:23.825 --> 03:26.687
And used the money to fund
Sandstorm's terror plots.

03:27.085 --> 03:29.345
We should see if Roman can
remember what he did with the money,

03:29.369 --> 03:31.839
and then maybe... we can track it.

03:31.864 --> 03:33.997
All right, let's go talk to Roman.

03:40.005 --> 03:41.505
You're here early.

03:41.507 --> 03:43.466
Our appointment's not
for another 30 minutes.

03:43.491 --> 03:46.278
Uh, yeah, I just wanted to talk to you.

03:46.303 --> 03:48.403
That's what appointments are for.

03:48.428 --> 03:51.207
No, I mean, thank you for your help,

03:51.232 --> 03:53.660
but I think I'm done with therapy.

03:54.942 --> 03:56.793
What makes you think that?

04:00.726 --> 04:02.673
Borden is dead.

04:03.361 --> 04:06.086
And I think that I'm ready
to move on with my life.

04:06.111 --> 04:08.078
Will you sit, please?

04:08.103 --> 04:09.700
No, thank you, I can't stay.

04:09.702 --> 04:13.173
Were you there when Borden died?

04:16.334 --> 04:18.666
- Yes.
- How did he die?

04:21.433 --> 04:23.683
Those headaches that I was having,

04:23.784 --> 04:25.971
those ones that you
said were psychosomatic?

04:25.996 --> 04:27.464
They weren't.

04:27.847 --> 04:30.025
Sandstorm drilled a hole in my tooth,

04:30.050 --> 04:31.464
and they planted a bug in there,

04:31.489 --> 04:34.605
so the pain that I was having
was just purely physical.

04:35.404 --> 04:36.941
So...

04:37.924 --> 04:40.441
even after he left,

04:40.909 --> 04:44.172
Borden continued to invade your privacy,

04:44.197 --> 04:45.894
even your body.

04:46.708 --> 04:48.714
That's a horrible violation.

04:49.369 --> 04:51.361
Surely that's upsetting to you.

04:56.728 --> 04:58.643
It isn't anything to me.

05:00.838 --> 05:03.930
It's over. I'm fine.

05:10.040 --> 05:11.676
What do they want?

05:11.745 --> 05:13.448
Why aren't they telling us anything?

05:13.959 --> 05:16.002
Oliver, this is all my fault.

05:16.057 --> 05:17.973
And I'm sorry you got caught up in it.

05:17.998 --> 05:19.298
What are you talking about?

05:19.323 --> 05:21.649
It's a long story, but I have enemies.

05:21.674 --> 05:23.189
Powerful, dangerous ones.

05:23.214 --> 05:24.876
And I'm sure they're behind this.

05:24.901 --> 05:27.690
You have enemies? What enemies?

05:28.444 --> 05:30.043
Look, there's no time to explain.

05:30.068 --> 05:31.402
We just have to get out of here.

05:31.427 --> 05:33.141
Well, I'm not sure that's a good idea.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.161
They could kill us if we try to escape.

05:35.186 --> 05:37.278
Or we do escape, and
then we freeze to death

05:37.280 --> 05:39.013
in the middle-of-nowhere Vermont!

05:40.297 --> 05:41.730
Maybe we should just...

05:42.786 --> 05:44.433
How the hell do you know where we are?

05:44.458 --> 05:45.753
Did Shepherd send you to me?

05:45.778 --> 05:47.983
What? No! I don't know Shepherd,

05:48.008 --> 05:49.338
I swear.

05:51.450 --> 05:53.727
We didn't get kidnapped because of you!

05:55.545 --> 05:57.144
It's because of me.

05:57.169 --> 05:58.985
Good morning, Oliver Steele.

05:59.010 --> 06:01.662
In the top drawer of the
vanity, you'll find a message.

06:01.687 --> 06:04.845
Stand in front of the
camera and read it aloud.

06:15.221 --> 06:17.726
"My father, Magnus
Steele, took $200 million

06:17.751 --> 06:19.967
"from innocent, hard-working Americans.

06:19.992 --> 06:21.445
"Today that wrong will be righted.

06:21.470 --> 06:24.328
"He will return the money
by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time.

06:24.330 --> 06:26.867
"Or my girlfriend and
I will be executed."

www.addic7ed.com

06:46.620 --> 06:47.971
But why here?

06:48.575 --> 06:50.339
Why this house?

06:50.364 --> 06:53.550
I grew up in Sydney,
but my dad was American.

06:53.575 --> 06:55.081
We rented this ski cabin

06:55.106 --> 06:57.245
a couple winters when I was a kid.

06:58.006 --> 06:59.589
This was my bedroom.

06:59.816 --> 07:01.683
That's how I knew this was in Vermont.

07:01.708 --> 07:03.919
But I don't know what the
address is, I was too young.

07:03.944 --> 07:06.746
Okay, so, whoever did this
knows a lot about your family.

07:06.771 --> 07:10.247
Well, I... my dad was a
high-powered accountant.

07:10.272 --> 07:13.628
I assume this is some statement
about my privileged childhood.

07:13.653 --> 07:15.553
The card doesn't say to pay the money.

07:15.555 --> 07:17.755
It says to give the money back.

07:18.613 --> 07:20.161
Okay...

07:20.994 --> 07:24.836
I went to work at my dad's
firm after university.

07:25.633 --> 07:28.155
One day, I found a
discrepancy in the accounts,

07:28.180 --> 07:29.713
and I confronted him.

07:29.742 --> 07:33.155
Turned out that my father
and his business partner

07:33.180 --> 07:35.224
were involved in a Ponzi scheme.

07:35.249 --> 07:37.149
They were stealing
money from their clients.

07:37.174 --> 07:38.974
So, that's the $200 million.

07:38.976 --> 07:42.362
I was disgusted, I threatened
to go to the police.

07:43.893 --> 07:45.315
And he ran.

07:45.917 --> 07:47.723
He left the country,
and he never came back.

07:47.755 --> 07:50.072
But you haven't talked
to him ever since?

07:50.611 --> 07:52.033
No.

07:52.768 --> 07:54.877
But every year at Christmastime, I...

07:55.541 --> 07:57.905
leave a voicemail at
his old work number,

07:57.907 --> 08:00.525
begging him to come back
and just turn himself in.

08:00.979 --> 08:02.446
And the mailbox never gets full,

08:02.448 --> 08:03.620
so I know he's still checking it.

08:03.644 --> 08:05.549
Wait, and you never went to the cops

08:05.551 --> 08:07.097
after all these years.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.854
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

08:11.290 --> 08:13.890
I left the firm, and
I started my charity.

08:13.892 --> 08:15.893
And changed your name to Oliver Kind.

08:17.629 --> 08:19.572
Jane, I'm sorry I kept this from you.

08:19.597 --> 08:21.365
No, it's... look, I know a thing or two

08:21.367 --> 08:23.174
about screwed-up families, okay?

08:23.199 --> 08:25.846
Let's just worry about
getting out of here.

08:25.871 --> 08:27.144
How?

08:27.169 --> 08:29.964
Even if my dad sees this
video, wherever he is,

08:29.989 --> 08:32.417
he is not gonna pay a ransom to save me.

08:33.261 --> 08:35.323
No, we're not gonna make that video.

08:53.654 --> 08:55.955
My condolences for your loss.

08:55.980 --> 08:57.913
Were you close with the deceased?

08:57.915 --> 09:00.149
I didn't come here for grief counseling.

09:00.151 --> 09:01.705
I came for my inheritance.

09:01.730 --> 09:03.402
Yes, sir,

09:03.427 --> 09:05.120
my apologies.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.737
Just sign here.

09:12.631 --> 09:14.360
I was...

09:15.493 --> 09:18.868
I was posing as his next of kin.

09:19.220 --> 09:21.109
Her next of kin.

09:21.134 --> 09:23.728
We don't know who the trust belonged to.

09:23.753 --> 09:25.397
We were hoping you might remember.

09:25.422 --> 09:28.618
Or perhaps you'd know what
you did with the money.

09:29.763 --> 09:31.149
I don't.

09:32.325 --> 09:33.860
I'm sorry.

09:38.718 --> 09:41.619
I killed this person
for their money, right?

09:41.644 --> 09:43.458
That's what you're thinking?

09:44.872 --> 09:46.169
We don't know that.

09:46.194 --> 09:48.361
Well, it makes perfect sense.

09:50.261 --> 09:52.762
Memory after memory. I...

09:53.794 --> 09:55.411
I killed people.

09:58.403 --> 10:00.145
That's who I was.

10:01.939 --> 10:03.606
A monster.

10:03.608 --> 10:06.441
You're not that person anymore.

10:06.466 --> 10:07.866
How do you know that?

10:09.503 --> 10:11.569
Because I watched Jane go through

10:11.571 --> 10:14.298
exactly what you're
going through right now.

10:15.976 --> 10:18.384
I've seen you with my team.

10:20.160 --> 10:22.560
And you want to do good...

10:23.417 --> 10:25.654
just like your sister.

10:30.654 --> 10:32.416
I wish I could believe that.

10:33.660 --> 10:35.493
Roman...

10:40.431 --> 10:42.215
If we can force them
to come in and face us,

10:42.240 --> 10:44.640
we might actually have a chance
to overpower them and escape.

10:44.665 --> 10:46.004
How are we gonna do that?

10:47.785 --> 10:49.121
With this.

10:49.722 --> 10:53.363
They need you to make the
video if they want the ransom.

10:53.388 --> 10:55.153
So, if we destroy the
camera, they'll have no choice

10:55.177 --> 10:57.077
but to come in and film you themselves.

10:57.102 --> 10:58.558
Hand me that lamp.

11:01.355 --> 11:02.822
How do you know how to do all of this?

11:02.846 --> 11:04.271
The MacGyver routine,

11:04.296 --> 11:06.096
that kung fu move you pulled on me...

11:06.121 --> 11:08.854
I grew up in a family
of criminals, bad ones.

11:08.879 --> 11:10.778
I used to be one, but I'm not anymore.

11:10.803 --> 11:12.064
Watch yourself.

11:13.112 --> 11:14.244
Here.

11:15.796 --> 11:17.493
You sure this is gonna work?

11:23.237 --> 11:24.736
Don't move!

11:33.761 --> 11:36.339
Guess it was a mistake to take the girl.

11:42.007 --> 11:43.763
You wanted to see me?

11:43.788 --> 11:45.121
Yeah.

11:47.371 --> 11:49.972
Tasha came to see me last night.

11:50.958 --> 11:54.343
She told me that you've been
going through some things...

11:54.368 --> 11:55.874
in your personal life.

11:55.899 --> 11:57.766
And that she's really worried about you.

11:58.766 --> 11:59.999
No one asked her to worry about me...

12:00.001 --> 12:03.546
Reade, she told me
there's been drug use.

12:03.971 --> 12:07.006
- I made some dumb mistakes...
- You need to stop talking right now.

12:07.008 --> 12:09.208
I can't have this conversation.

12:09.328 --> 12:12.015
Any version of it will end
up with me suspending you,

12:12.040 --> 12:14.078
so here's what's gonna happen.

12:17.121 --> 12:19.484
You're gonna put in for some time off.

12:20.477 --> 12:23.672
Vacation, leave of absence.

12:24.649 --> 12:27.116
Whatever you want, I'll approve it.

12:27.172 --> 12:31.053
But, Edgar, whatever it is
that you're going through,

12:31.266 --> 12:34.108
we can help you, but you need to...

12:34.133 --> 12:36.350
How the hell would you know what I need?

12:36.375 --> 12:37.841
I know that you need help,

12:37.866 --> 12:39.946
I know that I'm in no
position to give it to you,

12:39.971 --> 12:42.406
- so, as your friend...
- We're not friends. We're not family.

12:42.430 --> 12:45.097
- You're my boss, that's it.
- Fine, as your boss,

12:45.099 --> 12:46.523
I'm advising you not to throw away

12:46.548 --> 12:47.914
your career with the FBI.

12:47.939 --> 12:51.296
Especially not to throw away
your career with this team.

12:51.321 --> 12:53.602
You don't give a damn about me.

12:53.676 --> 12:56.610
You're only worried about how
this affects you and your team.

12:57.027 --> 12:59.173
You wanna be very careful about
what you say to me right now.

12:59.197 --> 13:01.630
Oh, yeah, or what? You
wanna fire me, fire me.

13:01.655 --> 13:03.816
I'm doing everything in
my power not to fire you.

13:03.818 --> 13:05.084
Do you understand that?

13:05.086 --> 13:06.617
Why don't I save you the trouble?

13:07.689 --> 13:09.016
I quit.

13:12.160 --> 13:14.260
- Reade, I...
- Go to hell.

13:19.703 --> 13:23.238
Tell me, Oliver, what's Magnus like?

13:23.914 --> 13:25.828
Was he a good dad to you?

13:26.335 --> 13:28.341
He was... fine.

13:28.366 --> 13:30.273
I was a good dad.

13:30.703 --> 13:33.274
I taught my daughter to
be strong and work hard,

13:33.299 --> 13:34.665
and she did.

13:34.690 --> 13:36.406
She built a business from the ground up,

13:36.431 --> 13:37.992
my baby girl.

13:38.495 --> 13:40.962
And then she trusted the wrong people.

13:40.964 --> 13:42.828
She lost everything.

13:43.434 --> 13:45.226
She went bankrupt.

13:45.593 --> 13:48.303
Had to fire all 52 of her employees.

13:48.305 --> 13:51.929
Oh... oh, that broke her heart.

13:55.412 --> 13:57.750
They say it's just money,

13:57.775 --> 14:00.156
but it's not just money.

14:00.447 --> 14:02.147
It's people's lives.

14:04.461 --> 14:05.750
She was 32 years old

14:05.775 --> 14:08.195
when she jumped off the G.W. Bridge.

14:11.745 --> 14:13.821
Her name was Jessica.

14:15.259 --> 14:18.153
It's taken me ten years to figure out

14:18.178 --> 14:20.445
who was responsible for her death.

14:20.447 --> 14:23.180
Cops dropped out after two years.

14:23.383 --> 14:26.219
A lost decade, but it was worth it

14:26.244 --> 14:29.367
to make your father pay for my loss.

14:31.758 --> 14:33.791
So, you read the message...

14:38.131 --> 14:39.979
or you lose her.

14:43.024 --> 14:44.995
Just do what he says.

14:47.574 --> 14:49.764
"My father, Magnus Steele,

14:49.789 --> 14:51.298
"took $200 million

14:51.323 --> 14:53.915
"from innocent, hard-working Americans.

14:54.267 --> 14:56.313
"Today, that wrong will be righted.

14:56.338 --> 14:59.139
"He will return the money
by 6:00 p.m., Eastern time,

14:59.141 --> 15:01.712
"or my girlfriend and
I will be executed."

15:05.347 --> 15:07.463
Copy, the other one's ready to go, too.

15:07.488 --> 15:08.932
What other one?

15:14.362 --> 15:15.772
What's going on, Patterson?

15:15.797 --> 15:17.003
There's something you need to see.

15:17.027 --> 15:18.877
This was posted to
YouTube ten minutes ago.

15:18.902 --> 15:20.677
That's the guy Jane's
been seeing, Oliver.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.104
He's been kidnapped?

15:22.414 --> 15:25.449
Not just him. Jane's been taken too.

15:25.474 --> 15:28.160
Okay, we need to locate
Oliver's father immediately.

15:28.185 --> 15:29.885
Wait, there's more.

15:31.646 --> 15:33.947
"Our mother, Edith Kananack,

15:33.949 --> 15:35.548
"took $200 million

15:35.550 --> 15:37.619
"from innocent,
hard-working Americans..."

15:37.644 --> 15:39.198
These videos were posted together

15:39.223 --> 15:41.151
with instructions from the kidnappers.

15:41.176 --> 15:43.081
It's a prisoner's dilemma.

15:43.909 --> 15:46.673
The first parent to pay the
ransom gets their kids back.

15:47.766 --> 15:50.079
And the other one
gets to watch them die.

15:56.419 --> 15:58.767
13 years ago, a
prominent New York banker

15:58.792 --> 16:01.023
was caught running a Ponzi
scheme on his clients.

16:01.048 --> 16:03.328
Drained their life savings,
ruined hundreds of lives,

16:03.353 --> 16:05.916
and made off with over $200 million.

16:05.941 --> 16:07.283
Brian Canfield.

16:07.308 --> 16:09.134
Exactly, he went to prison for life,

16:09.159 --> 16:10.317
but they never found the money.

16:10.341 --> 16:11.874
Rumor was that he had a co-conspirator

16:11.876 --> 16:12.943
who laundered the money for him,

16:12.967 --> 16:14.817
but no one could figure out who it was.

16:14.842 --> 16:16.642
Oliver's dad Magnus Steele

16:16.667 --> 16:18.534
and his business partner Edith Kananack.

16:18.583 --> 16:20.249
Looks like they were
the co-conspirators.

16:20.251 --> 16:22.347
And now the kidnappers are
playing them against each other,

16:22.371 --> 16:24.186
trying to get the $200 million.

16:24.188 --> 16:26.543
We need to find both of them
before they try to pay that ransom.

16:26.567 --> 16:29.597
Well, Magnus left the U.S.
shortly after Canfield was caught,

16:29.622 --> 16:31.370
and he's been off the grid ever since...

16:31.395 --> 16:33.301
- I'm still looking for leads.
- What about Edith?

16:33.325 --> 16:36.659
Up until this morning, she was
retired and living in Greenwich,

16:36.684 --> 16:39.185
living a normal life, but
she destroyed her cell phone

16:39.210 --> 16:41.372
immediately after the
videos were uploaded.

16:41.397 --> 16:43.464
I'll put out an APB, she
can't have gotten far.

16:43.489 --> 16:45.831
And I'll work on decrypting
the YouTube videos.

16:45.856 --> 16:47.864
What about Reade... is he in yet?

16:48.428 --> 16:50.708
No, he's... he's not coming in today.

16:50.840 --> 16:52.895
I'm wanna go and talk to Roman.

16:52.920 --> 16:54.372
Fill him in.

16:57.622 --> 16:59.588
The whole team is working on it,

16:59.590 --> 17:01.790
all right, and we will find her.

17:02.176 --> 17:05.828
So, do you need me to
try to remember something?

17:05.829 --> 17:08.230
No, you're her brother.

17:08.232 --> 17:10.458
I thought you had every right to know.

17:12.492 --> 17:13.859
Thank you.

17:23.819 --> 17:27.093
You know, I met your
mother when I was 16.

17:27.577 --> 17:30.296
Shepherd's been watching me ever since.

17:30.824 --> 17:32.921
She's a master manipulator.

17:33.655 --> 17:35.455
She was the one...

17:35.480 --> 17:38.971
who got you the passport
to go to the Bahamas.

17:39.121 --> 17:42.673
So, if you did kill someone there...

17:43.834 --> 17:46.035
I'd say it was probably
under her orders.

17:46.981 --> 17:51.951
Maybe... old Roman wasn't a monster.

17:51.976 --> 17:54.491
Maybe he was just
being controlled by one.

17:54.516 --> 17:55.944
Maybe.

18:03.988 --> 18:06.371
Jane's the only family I have left.

18:07.759 --> 18:09.551
I don't know what I'd...

18:10.595 --> 18:12.691
I don't know what I'd do if I lost her.

18:13.247 --> 18:14.863
We'll find her.

18:17.334 --> 18:19.267
You try to escape...

18:19.292 --> 18:21.510
Edith won't see her kids again.

18:26.659 --> 18:28.510
I've known those kids since
they were in preschool.

18:28.512 --> 18:31.597
I won't let anything
happen to them, okay?

18:33.026 --> 18:35.003
We just need a new plan.

18:35.028 --> 18:36.581
We can't run, so we need to find a way

18:36.606 --> 18:38.372
to tell my team where we are.

18:38.678 --> 18:39.944
What team?

18:41.004 --> 18:42.597
My FBI team.

18:44.261 --> 18:45.697
Who are you?

18:46.322 --> 18:48.431
No, seriously. Who the
hell have I been dating?

18:48.456 --> 18:50.681
I could ask you the same question.

18:52.236 --> 18:53.712
Look, we both kept secrets, okay?

18:53.737 --> 18:55.603
Clearly, we didn't trust
each other with them.

18:55.628 --> 18:57.172
But if we wanna get out of here alive,

18:57.174 --> 18:58.947
we need to trust each other now.

19:02.338 --> 19:04.276
Do you remember the
layout of this building?

19:04.301 --> 19:06.299
We need to get to a phone.

19:08.783 --> 19:11.018
When we used to come here,

19:11.389 --> 19:13.939
my dad's office was right
underneath this room.

19:14.037 --> 19:16.602
I would go to sleep listening
to him on his business calls.

19:16.627 --> 19:18.656
That's good, there might
still be a phone there

19:18.681 --> 19:20.095
and a piece mail with an address on it,

19:20.097 --> 19:21.630
to tell them where we are.

19:23.715 --> 19:25.735
We're gonna have to go up to go down.

19:36.210 --> 19:38.218
Hey... there's a phone!

19:38.549 --> 19:40.983
The new owners must've
converted it into a play room.

19:40.985 --> 19:42.627
- Hey, put the phone down!
- Hey, don't shoot!

19:42.651 --> 19:44.813
Put it down! Move!

19:48.492 --> 19:49.738
Go.

19:55.808 --> 19:57.042
Move!

20:00.191 --> 20:01.904
Edith Kananack's husband has been

20:01.906 --> 20:03.972
with an FBI team since this morning.

20:03.974 --> 20:06.517
He swears he has no idea where Edith is,

20:06.542 --> 20:08.765
but his phone records
tell a different story.

20:08.796 --> 20:10.531
Right after the videos came out,

20:10.556 --> 20:12.347
he received one incoming call

20:12.349 --> 20:13.982
from a payphone in Pearl River.

20:13.984 --> 20:15.918
- Edith?
- That'd be my guess.

20:15.920 --> 20:18.751
After that, he made an outgoing
call to his mother, June.

20:18.776 --> 20:20.630
Wait, why involve the grandmother?

20:20.655 --> 20:22.435
Well, maybe they needed her help.

20:22.460 --> 20:25.045
Edith and her ex-husband
would want to pay the ransom

20:25.070 --> 20:28.225
to save their kids, but
if Edith comes forward,

20:28.250 --> 20:29.694
she'd be arrested for
stealing the money.

20:29.718 --> 20:31.599
And that's where the
grandmother comes in.

20:31.624 --> 20:34.045
She gives the money to the
kidnappers, the kids go free.

20:34.070 --> 20:35.685
Can we track the grandmother's cell?

20:35.710 --> 20:36.976
Where is she right now?

20:37.001 --> 20:39.189
Uh, headed north on the Palisades.

20:39.643 --> 20:41.971
She must be meeting with
Edith to get the cash.

20:41.996 --> 20:43.494
Patterson, get a team out there now.

20:43.519 --> 20:45.886
We need to intercept them
before they pay that ransom.

20:47.111 --> 20:48.650
Hey, look who I found.

20:48.675 --> 20:50.365
They climbed down the damn chimney.

20:50.367 --> 20:53.135
I told you to not let
them out of your sight!

20:53.137 --> 20:54.703
Sit down! Sit down!

20:54.705 --> 20:56.619
All of you, over here!

20:56.644 --> 20:58.046
Come here.

21:00.709 --> 21:03.176
The second screen in that monitor room,

21:03.514 --> 21:05.013
it's a different house.

21:05.015 --> 21:06.682
Maybe that's where
they're keeping the kids.

21:06.684 --> 21:08.452
I know where it is.

21:08.477 --> 21:11.478
The Kananacks used to summer
at a lake house upstate.

21:11.503 --> 21:13.403
I went there once.

21:13.428 --> 21:15.951
It's part of an estate
called Whiteshore.

21:15.976 --> 21:19.010
Okay, so all we need to do is
get that message out, and...

21:19.035 --> 21:20.635
Shut up.

21:20.660 --> 21:23.444
Another word, and I'll
blow your brains out.

21:23.469 --> 21:24.802
Both of you.

21:30.574 --> 21:32.508
Please, you have to let me go.

21:32.510 --> 21:33.803
You're gonna get my babies killed!

21:33.827 --> 21:36.178
Ma'am, we're gonna get them back.

21:36.180 --> 21:37.713
If you help us find Magnus,

21:37.715 --> 21:40.378
then we can save all of
the hostages at once...

21:40.403 --> 21:43.884
Magnus is... is in Lugano, Switzerland.

21:44.846 --> 21:46.798
Six feet underground.

21:48.679 --> 21:50.426
Magnus Steele is dead?

21:57.062 --> 21:58.195
Patterson.

21:58.197 --> 22:00.985
Uh, the hospital in Switzerland
confirmed Edith's story.

22:01.017 --> 22:03.884
Magnus was a cancer patient
there under an alias.

22:03.886 --> 22:05.086
He died six months ago.

22:05.088 --> 22:06.587
Without Magnus, we have nothing.

22:06.589 --> 22:08.273
The kidnappers don't
know that he's dead.

22:08.298 --> 22:10.532
And Edith gave her word
that she won't pay the ransom

22:10.534 --> 22:12.040
until the deadline's closer.

22:12.065 --> 22:14.632
So, we have bought a
little time to locate Jane.

22:19.619 --> 22:21.220
Why did you do that?

22:22.488 --> 22:23.788
I warned you.

22:23.790 --> 22:25.798
Now they're gonna kill those kids.

22:26.056 --> 22:28.359
- Is that what you wanted?
- No, don't hurt them.

22:28.361 --> 22:30.399
We weren't trying to escape.

22:30.424 --> 22:31.924
We were looking for a phone.

22:31.949 --> 22:33.264
What, to call for help?

22:33.266 --> 22:35.166
No, to call Magnus.

22:35.478 --> 22:37.165
He's in hiding, he's probably never

22:37.190 --> 22:39.337
going to see that YouTube video,

22:39.478 --> 22:41.605
but Oliver knows how to reach him.

22:41.607 --> 22:43.474
There's a voicemail he still checks.

22:43.476 --> 22:45.042
- Jane...
- So, if you want your money,

22:45.044 --> 22:46.853
you let us make the call.

22:50.270 --> 22:53.871
Damn it, fine, give it to them.

22:54.053 --> 22:55.594
Give it to them.

22:57.874 --> 22:59.696
On speaker.

23:01.064 --> 23:03.250
Dial your dad's old work number.

23:08.092 --> 23:10.634
You've reached the voice
mailbox of Magnus Steele.

23:10.636 --> 23:12.570
Please leave a message.

23:12.572 --> 23:14.553
Hi, Dad...

23:14.578 --> 23:17.443
it's me, Oliver.

23:17.999 --> 23:19.999
I know we haven't spoken in a while.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.467
Mr. Steele, this is
your son's girlfriend.

23:23.566 --> 23:26.397
He's too proud to ask
you for help, but I'm not.

23:26.740 --> 23:30.357
You need to pay $200 million,
or we're going to be killed.

23:30.678 --> 23:32.678
If you don't have the cash,
you can sell your collection

23:32.680 --> 23:36.014
of Roman sculptures and
the shepherd painting.

23:36.039 --> 23:39.117
Liquidate the phase two condos
in Florida if you have to.

23:39.119 --> 23:40.639
What's going on?

23:40.664 --> 23:42.621
Some of our routine NSA
surveillance software

23:42.623 --> 23:43.928
just flagged a phone message

23:43.953 --> 23:45.989
with multiple Sandstorm keywords in it.

23:46.014 --> 23:47.582
A new lead on Phase Two?

23:47.607 --> 23:49.037
Not exactly.

23:49.217 --> 23:51.140
If you don't have the cash,
you can sell your collection

23:51.164 --> 23:53.943
of Roman sculptures and
the shepherd painting.

23:53.968 --> 23:56.435
That's Jane! She must
have known that if she used

23:56.437 --> 23:58.537
Sandstorm terms, you
would intercept the call.

24:04.851 --> 24:07.299
Kurt, he shouldn't be up here.

24:07.581 --> 24:09.486
He's in a bad state, he needed to know

24:09.511 --> 24:11.985
that his sister is alive and
fighting to see him again.

24:12.010 --> 24:13.643
Where is she?

24:14.322 --> 24:16.288
The phone's signal is heavily cloaked,

24:16.313 --> 24:18.455
so we're still trying to work on it.

24:18.959 --> 24:21.460
You can still fix things with your son.

24:21.462 --> 24:23.228
But first things first.

24:23.230 --> 24:25.720
Send amount verified exactly.

24:25.863 --> 24:29.072
Killer is deranged,
sadistic, and terrifying.

24:29.403 --> 24:32.838
We're helpless in the end,
so hurry or risk everything.

24:32.840 --> 24:36.111
That last part, there's
something off about it.

24:36.136 --> 24:38.025
He's right, it's a code.

24:38.278 --> 24:41.142
Uh... first things first.

24:41.257 --> 24:42.923
Wait, uh, I got it.

24:42.948 --> 24:45.173
What if we use the first
letter of every word?

24:46.926 --> 24:49.226
Save kids at Whiteshore.

24:49.251 --> 24:50.522
What's "Whiteshore"?

24:50.524 --> 24:52.345
It's an exclusive resort upstate.

24:52.370 --> 24:54.027
She figured out where
the kids are being held,

24:54.051 --> 24:56.111
and she wants us to go rescue them.

24:56.136 --> 24:58.086
No, no-no-no, you can't do that,

24:58.111 --> 24:59.464
Jane could be killed.

24:59.466 --> 25:01.079
You gotta rescue both
parties at the same time.

25:01.103 --> 25:03.504
Roman, calm down, all
right, Jane sent us this.

25:03.506 --> 25:06.307
All right, and that means that she
wants us to go after those kids.

25:06.309 --> 25:07.641
That means she can probably handle

25:07.643 --> 25:09.401
the kidnappers on her end.

25:09.426 --> 25:11.237
We have to trust her.

25:11.544 --> 25:13.580
Nas, Patterson, you
keep searching for Jane.

25:13.582 --> 25:16.458
Tasha, you and me'll take
a team up to Whiteshore.

25:27.697 --> 25:30.654
As soon as we know the kids
are safe, we can escape.

25:31.193 --> 25:32.559
Jane, there's too many of them.

25:32.584 --> 25:34.279
We don't have a choice.

25:34.470 --> 25:36.951
I need you to trust me one last time.

25:38.529 --> 25:40.674
When I say run, run.

25:40.676 --> 25:43.093
I am sick of hearing you two yap!

25:43.118 --> 25:44.499
Shut up!

25:45.460 --> 25:46.523
FBI!

25:46.548 --> 25:48.273
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

26:05.007 --> 26:06.667
It's okay.

26:06.669 --> 26:09.351
It's okay, we're FBI,
everything's gonna be okay.

26:09.500 --> 26:11.562
I need you two to follow me.

26:12.072 --> 26:14.953
Weller? Coming down with the kids.

26:16.281 --> 26:17.999
Where are the other hostages?

26:20.711 --> 26:22.601
Where are the other hostages?

26:25.617 --> 26:28.163
- The Feds found the lake house!
- Run!

26:57.114 --> 26:59.581
What're you still doing
here? Oliver, we have to go!

26:59.606 --> 27:01.336
It was an accident.

27:02.969 --> 27:05.805
Look, listen to me. Hey, listen to me.

27:05.830 --> 27:08.336
You didn't have a
choice. It was him or you.

27:08.361 --> 27:10.828
It's okay, but we have to go, now.

27:10.853 --> 27:12.617
Okay? Come on, move.

27:15.401 --> 27:17.067
Well, well, well.

27:17.168 --> 27:18.868
What do we have here?

27:26.077 --> 27:27.637
We're running out of time here, Herman.

27:29.085 --> 27:30.418
Just let me think.

27:30.420 --> 27:32.086
The Feds are at the lake house, man.

27:32.087 --> 27:35.037
It's not gonna take 'em long
to figure out where we are.

27:35.257 --> 27:36.690
Herman, what do you want to do?

27:36.692 --> 27:38.514
I don't know!

27:41.412 --> 27:44.815
This is all wrong, why
isn't he contacting us?

27:53.369 --> 27:55.536
Your father has to be punished.

27:57.458 --> 27:59.225
I don't even want the money.

28:01.207 --> 28:04.451
I just want him to pay for what he did.

28:06.359 --> 28:08.820
I want him to feel the pain...

28:09.391 --> 28:10.992
that I felt...

28:12.007 --> 28:13.960
when I lost my Jessica.

28:13.962 --> 28:16.067
Magnus will never
feel that kind of pain.

28:16.092 --> 28:17.224
What?

28:17.249 --> 28:19.132
And he won't pay your ransom

28:19.274 --> 28:21.074
because he doesn't love his son

28:21.099 --> 28:22.498
like you loved your daughter.

28:22.523 --> 28:24.844
Threatening Oliver won't make
him surface with the money,

28:24.869 --> 28:26.970
and killing Oliver won't destroy him.

28:26.972 --> 28:28.773
Because you were right about Magnus.

28:28.798 --> 28:31.101
He isn't half the father you were.

28:31.943 --> 28:33.304
But he will pay for his crimes.

28:33.329 --> 28:35.966
And now that you've told
the world what he did,

28:35.990 --> 28:38.024
the authorities will find him.

28:38.183 --> 28:39.273
It's not enough.

28:39.298 --> 28:41.913
Nothing will be enough
to bring back Jessica.

28:42.794 --> 28:44.687
But is this what she would want?

28:45.305 --> 28:47.593
For you to become a murderer?

28:49.099 --> 28:50.604
It's not too late.

28:50.629 --> 28:53.086
You can still back out of all this.

28:54.366 --> 28:57.297
Just let us go.

29:05.919 --> 29:07.886
Take them back to the city.

29:07.911 --> 29:09.657
Drop them on a busy corner.

29:13.186 --> 29:15.718
Finally, some peace and quiet.

29:15.720 --> 29:17.887
For three months, we've been listening

29:17.889 --> 29:20.975
to that sad sack spout
his unhinged tirades,

29:21.000 --> 29:23.036
day in and day out,

29:23.061 --> 29:25.662
because we were promised
40% of the ransom.

29:25.842 --> 29:28.756
I want my 80 million.

29:28.829 --> 29:31.563
I... I don't have that
kind of money, not anymore.

29:31.588 --> 29:33.826
No-no-no-no...

29:34.192 --> 29:37.022
now, see, half of my team is dead...

29:37.047 --> 29:38.639
by your hand.

29:39.210 --> 29:43.091
Now lucky for you, I prefer
compensation to retaliation,

29:43.116 --> 29:45.325
but if I can't have my
first choice, well, then...

29:45.350 --> 29:48.568
Wait-wait... the charity
I run has deep pockets.

29:48.593 --> 29:51.794
Not 80 million, but 50 at least.

29:51.819 --> 29:53.560
You can have it all.

29:57.802 --> 30:00.045
Get the laptop for the wire transfer.

30:00.899 --> 30:03.701
Wait, wait, I can't do it from here.

30:03.726 --> 30:06.427
No, there's a fail-safe
for moving large amounts.

30:06.452 --> 30:09.029
It has to be authorized by
at least two board members.

30:10.008 --> 30:12.826
Well, we're just gonna have to find
another board member, aren't we?

30:13.239 --> 30:16.771
Wipe the place, we're
taking this show on the road.

30:31.256 --> 30:33.943
I know you feel helpless.

30:34.117 --> 30:37.410
I'm sorry that we had to bring
you back down here right away.

30:37.435 --> 30:39.013
Don't be.

30:39.228 --> 30:42.149
It's just, there's a lot
of sensitive intel around.

30:42.174 --> 30:44.575
I understand why I have to be in here.

30:46.520 --> 30:48.239
I belong here.

30:49.280 --> 30:50.579
Roman...

30:50.604 --> 30:52.538
You don't have to explain.

30:53.139 --> 30:55.360
Just let me know when she's safe.

30:56.089 --> 30:57.532
Of course.

31:09.723 --> 31:11.444
It reeks of bleach in here.

31:11.826 --> 31:14.160
They must've wiped this place clean.

31:14.185 --> 31:16.085
Might not be the right location.

31:16.110 --> 31:17.709
They could've lied to us.

31:21.458 --> 31:23.427
Weller, take a look
at these scratch marks.

31:23.452 --> 31:24.534
What about 'em?

31:24.582 --> 31:26.536
They're not just random scratches.

31:26.561 --> 31:28.728
They're the logo to
Oliver's water charity.

31:28.753 --> 31:29.986
How do you know that?

31:30.011 --> 31:32.747
Jane had me look into Oliver
when they first started dating.

31:32.772 --> 31:34.091
That's probably where they're headed.

31:34.115 --> 31:35.548
All right, let's move!

31:37.441 --> 31:38.874
Now, listen, man, remember,

31:38.876 --> 31:40.442
the only thing you gotta do

31:40.445 --> 31:43.150
is get your CFO to
make that wire transfer,

31:43.175 --> 31:44.547
and we all go home.

31:44.549 --> 31:47.116
But if you try and
escape, yell for help,

31:47.118 --> 31:48.933
Darren's gonna open
fire in that building.

31:48.958 --> 31:50.424
If you try to be a hero,

31:50.449 --> 31:53.656
my colleagues are gonna slit your
girlfriend's pretty little throat.

31:53.658 --> 31:55.328
- You understand what I'm saying to you?
- Yeah, yeah.

31:55.352 --> 31:56.417
Let's go.

32:02.635 --> 32:03.960
Jill?

32:04.297 --> 32:05.835
Oliver, what...

32:06.070 --> 32:08.093
It... it's gonna be okay.

32:08.907 --> 32:10.617
Oh, God, you're the
one who kidnapped him.

32:10.726 --> 32:12.858
Hey, all he wants is money.

32:12.883 --> 32:15.256
Okay, I just need your co-authorization

32:15.258 --> 32:16.623
to empty out the account.

32:21.687 --> 32:23.119
Do we have eyes inside, Patterson?

32:23.121 --> 32:25.288
I tapped into the security footage.

32:25.290 --> 32:27.590
Oliver is in the CFO's
office on the 19th floor...

32:27.592 --> 32:29.114
there's a man with a gun on him.

32:29.139 --> 32:30.570
Let's move.

32:35.075 --> 32:37.281
Jill, we need your password now.

32:43.475 --> 32:45.508
I'm sorry, I just made a mistake.

32:45.510 --> 32:47.812
You do it again, and you lose a limb.

33:48.787 --> 33:52.651
Edith made a full confession,
she's facing fraud charges.

33:52.676 --> 33:55.210
So, I'm guessing you didn't find my dad.

33:57.564 --> 33:59.056
Uh...

34:01.714 --> 34:03.854
I'm so sorry, Oliver.

34:03.879 --> 34:06.487
Magnus died of cancer six months ago.

34:09.976 --> 34:12.335
There's one other thing.

34:12.592 --> 34:14.592
In the last two years of his life,

34:14.594 --> 34:16.873
he gave away most of his fortune...

34:18.635 --> 34:22.288
in large, anonymous
donations, to your charity.

34:29.002 --> 34:31.588
- I'll give you guys some privacy.
- Thanks.

34:34.641 --> 34:37.859
Look, I know it doesn't make
up for what he did, but...

34:38.657 --> 34:40.701
at least he was trying.

34:41.076 --> 34:42.812
He did care about you.

34:46.078 --> 34:47.342
Maybe.

34:48.359 --> 34:49.723
Or maybe he was just trying to clear

34:49.746 --> 34:52.047
his own conscience before he died.

34:53.351 --> 34:54.960
Do you...

34:55.922 --> 34:57.804
can I take you home?

34:59.570 --> 35:00.906
Um...

35:03.151 --> 35:05.956
I think I'd probably
just like to be alone.

35:05.981 --> 35:07.554
Of course.

35:09.414 --> 35:11.714
- Look, Jane...
- You don't have to say it.

35:11.716 --> 35:14.154
It's just all too much right now.

35:14.179 --> 35:15.789
You know, I just...

35:16.789 --> 35:18.687
I don't think I have the...

35:18.953 --> 35:21.123
emotional real estate...

35:21.312 --> 35:24.461
for someone whose life is
as complicated as my own.

35:28.179 --> 35:29.724
It's okay.

35:30.569 --> 35:32.603
You were incredible today.

35:36.989 --> 35:38.774
You want to let Roman out?

35:38.776 --> 35:40.052
House arrest, all right?

35:40.077 --> 35:42.256
He'll still be under
round-the-clock surveillance.

35:42.281 --> 35:43.989
Look, we've kept him in a cage because

35:44.014 --> 35:45.357
we're afraid of what he might become,

35:45.381 --> 35:46.850
but it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

35:46.852 --> 35:48.218
We treat him like a monster,

35:48.220 --> 35:49.639
and he's starting to
think of himself that way.

35:49.663 --> 35:52.387
We treat him like a criminal who's
being punished for his wrongdoing.

35:52.412 --> 35:53.811
Except Roman is an asset, all right?

35:53.813 --> 35:56.233
The most valuable asset against
Sandstorm that we've got,

35:56.258 --> 35:57.548
and instead of turning him to our side,

35:57.550 --> 35:58.980
we're actually pushing him away.

35:59.005 --> 36:01.339
Look, if we want Roman to help us,

36:01.341 --> 36:02.974
then we need to start treating him

36:02.976 --> 36:04.642
like he's potentially
one of the good guys.

36:04.644 --> 36:08.081
We know exactly what that
man has the potential to be.

36:08.106 --> 36:09.704
And every single one of those memories

36:09.729 --> 36:12.052
that you're so desperate to
pry out of his damaged brain

36:12.077 --> 36:14.314
can turn him right back into it.

36:14.646 --> 36:16.572
You won't get my approval on this.

36:16.667 --> 36:19.243
Fine, we'll take it to Pellington.

36:21.890 --> 36:23.783
This is a mistake.

36:33.210 --> 36:36.083
Hey, I heard about Reade.
Is he gonna be okay?

36:37.824 --> 36:39.497
Honestly, I don't know.

36:41.887 --> 36:44.207
- What about you?
- I'll be okay.

36:44.232 --> 36:45.700
You sure?

36:46.598 --> 36:48.356
I mean, I... I've never
been dumped before,

36:48.358 --> 36:51.347
that... didn't feel awesome.

36:51.372 --> 36:53.795
But... he was right.

36:53.797 --> 36:56.044
There's just too much
baggage between us.

36:56.069 --> 36:57.661
That is a cop-out.

36:58.012 --> 36:59.935
- No, it isn't.
- It totally is.

36:59.937 --> 37:01.937
Everyone has baggage they
bring to a relationship.

37:01.939 --> 37:04.551
You and Oliver just weren't
right for each other.

37:04.576 --> 37:06.264
How do you know?

37:06.755 --> 37:09.391
Because when someone's
really right for you,

37:09.416 --> 37:11.325
you make room.

37:12.318 --> 37:15.278
Jane, come with me please.

37:17.923 --> 37:19.556
Good night.

37:25.726 --> 37:27.159
What is this? What's going on?

37:27.184 --> 37:29.951
They're, uh, putting me on house arrest.

37:33.637 --> 37:34.790
I'm getting out.

37:34.792 --> 37:37.821
He's gonna go home with
you, stay at the safe house.

37:37.846 --> 37:40.262
There are conditions to the deal.

37:40.264 --> 37:42.030
You'll report to SIOC
with Jane every morning

37:42.032 --> 37:44.431
to continue your
mandatory sessions with me.

37:44.456 --> 37:47.167
And then you'll return to
the safe house every night.

37:47.440 --> 37:50.193
All other movements are restricted.

37:50.487 --> 37:53.421
You're still in FBI custody.
That has not changed.

37:53.446 --> 37:55.012
You're getting out.

37:57.583 --> 37:59.450
I'll see you tomorrow.

38:04.892 --> 38:06.540
Thank you.

38:06.793 --> 38:09.314
You have no idea what this means to me.

38:09.807 --> 38:12.236
I have some idea.

38:20.092 --> 38:21.850
Let me get another.

38:21.875 --> 38:23.001
A double?

38:25.212 --> 38:27.045
You're not driving, are you?

38:27.070 --> 38:28.636
Where else am I gonna go?

38:47.309 --> 38:48.965
Now, I can't cook.

38:48.990 --> 38:51.605
But I can order with the best of 'em.

38:52.403 --> 38:53.777
Here.

38:54.755 --> 38:56.521
Okay.

38:57.541 --> 38:59.737
How about Alfred's Chinese?

38:59.762 --> 39:02.729
No, thanks, I almost
died once already today.

39:11.040 --> 39:12.498
What is it?

39:12.523 --> 39:15.910
That money I took from the
Bahamas for Sandstorm...

39:16.360 --> 39:19.494
I'm pretty sure I didn't
kill anyone for it.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.123
Well, how do you know?

39:21.148 --> 39:23.824
Because the trust fund
belonged to Alice Kruger.

39:25.502 --> 39:27.135
It belonged to you.

39:34.722 --> 39:36.321
_

39:48.301 --> 39:51.632
Borden continued to invade your privacy.

39:51.657 --> 39:53.707
Surely that's upsetting to you.

40:51.631 --> 40:55.122
Hey, I'm looking to
party, can you help me out?

40:55.147 --> 40:57.047
Nah, bro, you got the wrong person.

40:57.049 --> 40:59.717
You just sold to my
friend in the plaid shirt.

40:59.719 --> 41:01.672
- He told me to come see you.
- Wait... wait-wait,

41:01.696 --> 41:03.020
I know him.

41:03.022 --> 41:05.522
He was at the raid two years
ago on my cousin's crew.

41:05.524 --> 41:07.162
He a cop, brah!

41:07.553 --> 41:09.514
No-no-no, I'm not... I'm not...

41:20.156 --> 41:21.953
Come on, go, come on...

41:27.961 --> 41:30.749
How did the trust fund end up in
Jane's name in the first place?

41:30.774 --> 41:32.374
I don't know, but now
that we're aware of it,

41:32.376 --> 41:33.812
we can try to track it back,

41:33.837 --> 41:35.644
hopefully back to Shepherd.

41:35.646 --> 41:37.882
But this feels different.

41:37.907 --> 41:39.563
For the past couple weeks, I...

41:39.588 --> 41:41.890
I feel like we're really
closing in on them.

41:41.978 --> 41:43.508
I hope so.

41:43.533 --> 41:45.133
You know, I can't even remember

41:45.158 --> 41:48.226
what my life was like before
I started hunting Sandstorm.

41:48.251 --> 41:49.834
- Hmm.
- How sad is that?

41:49.859 --> 41:51.562
Speaking to the wrong guy.

41:51.922 --> 41:55.122
Turns out my life hasn't been
my own for the last 20 years.

41:55.124 --> 41:57.008
Excuse me, are you Kurt Weller?

41:57.033 --> 41:58.675
Yes, I am, why?

41:58.700 --> 42:00.500
You've been served.

42:13.320 --> 42:14.607
What the hell is this about?

42:14.632 --> 42:16.499
Your team is being investigated.

42:16.501 --> 42:17.685
For what?

42:21.753 --> 42:24.164
"Aiding and abetting a
terrorist organization."
