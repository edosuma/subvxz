WEBVTT

00:00.951 --> 00:03.017
MOIRA: Look at the state
of this place,

00:03.019 --> 00:05.754
It's like we're in
a Mumbaian slum.

00:05.756 --> 00:08.623
A year ago we had a staff
of twenty-five

00:08.625 --> 00:10.058
working the grounds
of our home,

00:10.060 --> 00:12.927
and now we walk by a mattress
on the side of the road,

00:12.929 --> 00:14.629
without thinking twice
about it.

00:14.631 --> 00:16.831
- Well, the good news
is that mattress is covering up

00:16.833 --> 00:19.067
the cracked toilet seat.
- Oh, John.

00:19.069 --> 00:22.003
John, do you remember
what Goldie Hawn told us

00:22.005 --> 00:23.805
at that AmFar dinner?

00:23.807 --> 00:25.273
- I dunno.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.876
- "You are the life
you accept for yourself."

00:27.878 --> 00:29.844
Those are Goldie's words.

00:29.846 --> 00:31.913
Or something someone said
to her in India.

00:31.915 --> 00:34.015
Or perhaps she read it.

00:34.017 --> 00:36.084
In any case, it has always
stayed with me.

00:36.086 --> 00:39.721
John, I will not accept
this life.

00:39.723 --> 00:41.756
And neither should you!

00:41.758 --> 00:42.525
Yeah.

00:42.551 --> 00:45.593
I mean, would it kill someone
to plant a few peonies?!

00:45.595 --> 00:47.829
- I have a feeling
if you want peonies, Moira,

00:47.831 --> 00:50.732
you're gonna have to plant
them yourself.

00:50.734 --> 00:52.834
- (Chuckles)

00:52.836 --> 00:56.171
(Cackles wildly)

00:56.173 --> 00:59.207
- These are dark times John,
but not that dark.

01:02.913 --> 01:07.949
♪ ♪

01:07.951 --> 01:10.285
(Alexis sighs happily)

01:11.755 --> 01:15.857
I love how we can just be
silent with each other.

01:15.859 --> 01:17.826
- Yeah.

01:17.828 --> 01:19.928
- I mean, I definitely feel
like we used to talk more

01:19.930 --> 01:21.596
at the beginning,

01:21.598 --> 01:25.166
but um, it's good that we don't
have to do that anymore.

01:25.168 --> 01:30.805
Because now we can just express
how we feel through silence.

01:30.807 --> 01:33.274
- (Laughs)

01:33.276 --> 01:35.143
- What?
- Nothing.

01:35.145 --> 01:37.512
- What?

01:37.514 --> 01:39.280
- It's just, you're talking about
how nice it is not to talk,

01:39.282 --> 01:41.015
but you're still talking
about it.

01:41.017 --> 01:42.917
- I mean, yeah, I'm not a mute!

01:42.919 --> 01:46.187
- Well, that is
an understatement.

01:46.189 --> 01:49.157
- Are we having some non-fight
fight or something?

01:49.159 --> 01:51.125
because all I'm saying is that
it's nice to not talk,

01:51.127 --> 01:53.294
but apparently I'm not allowed
to say that?!

01:53.296 --> 01:54.996
- No fight.

01:54.998 --> 01:56.397
It's not a fight.

01:56.399 --> 01:57.999
All I am saying
is that you know,

01:58.001 --> 01:59.801
You need to talk
about everything,

01:59.803 --> 02:02.537
and I... don't.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.339
- I don't need to talk
about everything,

02:04.341 --> 02:06.407
I'm just saying that
if I stopped talking,

02:06.409 --> 02:09.010
then who knows when we're
gonna start talking again.

02:09.012 --> 02:11.846
You know?

02:11.848 --> 02:13.581
(Mutt sighs)

02:16.653 --> 02:19.587
(Music plays softly)

02:22.792 --> 02:24.759
- That way.
- Thank you.

02:24.761 --> 02:26.227
- Are those my mannequins?

02:26.229 --> 02:28.296
- Yeah.

02:28.298 --> 02:31.366
- Well, where are they going?!

02:31.368 --> 02:35.069
- Oh, I sold them on eBay.
- Well, what do you mean?

02:35.071 --> 02:38.206
- But don't worry, I'm using the
money to buy other mannequins,

02:38.208 --> 02:39.874
ones that are a little less
um...

02:39.876 --> 02:41.676
- Fun?
- Porn-y.

02:41.678 --> 02:43.378
Uh, I also placed
a few other orders.

02:43.380 --> 02:44.979
Little things to scatter
around the store,

02:44.981 --> 02:46.781
to give the space a more
directional feel.

02:46.783 --> 02:49.817
- Oh David, I saw some cute
little knick-knacks

02:49.819 --> 02:52.453
that I thought we could pair
with the scarves.

02:52.455 --> 02:55.924
Where are the scarves?
- Oh, I sold those, too.

02:55.926 --> 02:58.726
- Oh. Well, things are
happening very quickly.

02:58.728 --> 03:02.397
Now the candles, are they
something that we would sell

03:02.399 --> 03:03.865
at a blouse store?

03:03.867 --> 03:06.301
- No, those are just
decorative.

03:06.303 --> 03:08.136
Scent is a really important
factor in defining a brand.

03:08.138 --> 03:10.705
Alexander Wang once fired
my friend over the smell

03:10.707 --> 03:12.340
of his cologne.

03:12.342 --> 03:14.075
To Alex's credit,
"Curve Pour Hommes"

03:14.077 --> 03:16.177
hasn't been the look since '97.

03:16.179 --> 03:20.715
- Well, the look and the smell
here's very woody,

03:20.717 --> 03:22.684
very funky.

03:22.686 --> 03:26.921
Now David, you don't have
to sell all my things off.

03:26.923 --> 03:28.957
You can use the company
credit card.

03:28.959 --> 03:30.358
- Yeah, I used that, too.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.827
- Oh well then,
save all the receipts,

03:32.829 --> 03:36.864
because anything you buy
for the store is a write off.

03:36.866 --> 03:39.033
The candles,
and the jewelry stands--

03:39.035 --> 03:40.935
- No jewelry stands.

03:40.937 --> 03:42.403
- No jewelry--
- Noooo!

03:42.405 --> 03:45.239
- No, David! Jewelry stands!

03:45.241 --> 03:48.443
MOIRA: I have taken a moment
out of my busy schedule,

03:48.445 --> 03:52.447
because this poor town
is sliding into disarray.

03:52.449 --> 03:55.550
There is a filthy mattress just
lying on the side of the road

03:55.552 --> 03:57.852
a few blocks from here!

03:57.854 --> 03:59.754
- Oh no, that's Dick Sinson's
mattress, he's giving it away.

03:59.756 --> 04:02.890
- Ray, I have always seen you
as a sensitive,

04:02.892 --> 04:05.226
cultured, man of the world.

04:05.228 --> 04:06.761
You have that striking accent.

04:06.763 --> 04:08.229
- Thank you.

04:08.231 --> 04:10.965
- And I'm sure your family
wanted more for you

04:10.967 --> 04:13.401
when they immigrated from...

04:13.403 --> 04:16.371
- Winnipeg.
- Winnipeg.

04:16.373 --> 04:18.673
We deserve more, don't we, Ray?

04:18.675 --> 04:21.776
We deserve cleanliness,
we deserve flower beds,

04:21.778 --> 04:23.711
we deserve better lives!

04:23.713 --> 04:26.114
- You make some very good
points, Mrs. Rose.

04:26.116 --> 04:26.709
- Thank you.

04:26.735 --> 04:29.083
- But can I ask why are you
talking to me about this?

04:29.085 --> 04:31.919
- I'm hoping to take
my complaint to council,

04:31.921 --> 04:35.123
and I've been told you'd be
the easiest one to crack.

04:35.125 --> 04:37.025
- Too kind. And I'd be happy
to help.

04:37.027 --> 04:38.793
- Excellent!

04:38.795 --> 04:41.829
- But unfortunately, I'm no
longer on the town council.

04:41.831 --> 04:43.197
I resigned a few weeks ago,

04:43.199 --> 04:45.500
too overwhelmed with
my businesses.

04:45.502 --> 04:47.101
But uh, you're more than
welcome to take it

04:47.103 --> 04:49.137
to council yourself,
with my endorsement.

04:49.139 --> 04:50.872
Which won't really help,
since I resigned.

04:50.874 --> 04:53.408
Um, and council wasn't
too happy about it.

04:53.410 --> 04:55.143
I'm surprised you didn't hear,

04:55.145 --> 04:57.378
I talked about it extensively
on my podcast.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.213
- I don't know how
I missed that.

05:00.683 --> 05:02.583
(Pops, cap clinks)

05:02.585 --> 05:04.352
- David, is that you?

05:07.624 --> 05:09.357
- Huh?
- Hey!

05:09.359 --> 05:11.826
Look at us, son,
a couple of working stiffs

05:11.828 --> 05:13.895
back from the salt mines.

05:13.897 --> 05:16.898
- What?!
- Two men, back from the mines.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.366
- What mines? What's that mean?

05:18.368 --> 05:20.001
- It's a figure of speech.

05:20.003 --> 05:22.503
- Um, I don't get that.

05:22.505 --> 05:25.273
- The salt mines!
Back from when people mined.

05:25.275 --> 05:25.845
- Uh huh...

05:25.871 --> 05:28.076
- When miners worked in the...
salt industry,

05:28.078 --> 05:31.079
they'd come home,
after digging... salt.

05:31.081 --> 05:33.514
I don't know what it means!

05:33.516 --> 05:35.883
- Uh-huh, you know I just got
back from a four-hour shift

05:35.885 --> 05:38.519
that mostly consisted of me
sampling luxury candles so...

05:40.457 --> 05:42.824
- Well, that's-
that's a tough day.

05:42.826 --> 05:44.292
- Hmm.

05:44.294 --> 05:45.960
- Why don't you grab
yourself a cold one?

05:45.962 --> 05:47.995
You've earned it.

05:47.997 --> 05:51.632
Working man.
- Thank you.

05:51.634 --> 05:54.402
(David groans)

05:54.404 --> 05:56.104
There's nothing in here.
- Really?

05:56.106 --> 05:57.939
- Yeah.
- Oh, I must've taken the last one.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.640
- Okay.

06:02.312 --> 06:03.778
- You know, for what
it's worth, son,

06:03.780 --> 06:05.980
I just wanted to tell you uh...

06:05.982 --> 06:08.483
how proud of you I am.
- Thank you.

06:08.485 --> 06:10.418
- I mean, you got this job
all on your own,

06:10.420 --> 06:12.520
Nobody had to make a call,
nobody got involved,

06:12.522 --> 06:14.989
nobody had to...
pay somebody off.

06:14.991 --> 06:18.993
- What?
- And you're looking very, very sharp.

06:18.995 --> 06:20.862
- Well...
- Is that a new sweater?

06:20.864 --> 06:22.330
- Uh, it is.

06:22.332 --> 06:23.698
- Well, word to the wise, son,

06:23.700 --> 06:26.534
don't spend all your money
at once.

06:26.536 --> 06:28.469
- I thought you weren't getting involved.
- No, I'm not.

06:28.471 --> 06:31.506
I'm not, I'm just saying,
word to the wise, is all.

06:31.508 --> 06:34.108
- Okay, what does
"word to the wise" even mean?

06:34.110 --> 06:36.043
- Word to the wise.

06:37.514 --> 06:40.081
When you're speaking
to somebody wise,

06:40.083 --> 06:43.017
you lis- you're cognizant
of what they're saying.

06:43.019 --> 06:45.987
A wise person telling you...

06:45.989 --> 06:49.724
Anyway, just-just uh,
keep that in mind, and um...

06:49.726 --> 06:51.526
Keep up the good work.

06:52.896 --> 06:56.497
- Thanks so much. I'm just
gonna use this now. So...

06:58.668 --> 07:00.568
(Birds chirp)

07:05.808 --> 07:08.442
MUTT: Wake up sleepy head,
nap time's over.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.812
- (Screams)

07:11.814 --> 07:13.614
Honestly, honestly,
I have no money,

07:13.616 --> 07:15.650
and an empty purse
from two seasons ago!

07:15.652 --> 07:18.319
- Alexis, it's me.

07:18.321 --> 07:20.955
- Oh my God! Your face!

07:20.957 --> 07:22.723
- Yes, you can see it now!

07:22.725 --> 07:24.859
- You shaved!

07:27.397 --> 07:29.597
- Are you-are you crying?

07:29.599 --> 07:31.499
- No!

07:31.501 --> 07:33.601
- No, um, when did you do this?

07:33.603 --> 07:36.170
- Just now, I felt like
a change.

07:36.172 --> 07:38.072
- And you didn't talk
to me about it.

07:38.074 --> 07:39.941
- About me shaving my beard?

07:39.943 --> 07:41.709
- Yeah.
- Okay, what would we have talked about?

07:41.711 --> 07:43.077
It's my face.

07:43.079 --> 07:45.346
- Um...

07:45.348 --> 07:47.481
- You'dve said, uh,

07:47.483 --> 07:50.585
"Wow Alexis, I'm thinking
about shaving my beard."

07:52.589 --> 07:54.655
And then I would've said,

07:54.657 --> 07:57.525
"hm, no Mutt, I don't think
that that's the right journey

07:57.527 --> 08:00.194
for you at this point in time."

08:00.196 --> 08:01.495
Well, then I would've said,
"too bad."

08:01.497 --> 08:03.497
I shave like, every six months.

08:03.499 --> 08:05.399
Okay, you try growing a beard!

08:05.401 --> 08:08.469
- I was a beard for a very
well known actor,

08:08.471 --> 08:10.938
And I get it,
it's uncomfortable.

08:10.940 --> 08:13.941
But your beard is like,
my favorite thing about you!

08:13.943 --> 08:16.110
- My beard is your favorite
thing about me!

08:16.112 --> 08:18.079
- I said one of my favorite things.
- No, no, no, no.

08:18.081 --> 08:19.680
- You said, "favorite thing!"

08:19.682 --> 08:21.549
- I just woke up,
and you have a different face.

08:21.551 --> 08:24.252
So there's just a lot
going on right now!

08:24.254 --> 08:25.519
- Yeah, tell me about it,
I just found out

08:25.521 --> 08:26.887
that my girlfriend's
favorite thing about me

08:26.889 --> 08:29.390
is the hair that grows
out of my face!

08:29.392 --> 08:31.525
- I'm just saying...

08:31.527 --> 08:33.661
that I think that
that was a decision

08:33.663 --> 08:36.230
that we needed to make
as a couple.

08:36.232 --> 08:39.533
Okay? We need to communicate
more.

08:39.535 --> 08:42.370
- I really didn't think
that "this" was a thing

08:42.372 --> 08:43.804
we needed to talk about.

08:43.806 --> 08:45.673
I thought we had a deeper
thing goin' on.

08:45.675 --> 08:47.074
- That's not what this
is about.

08:47.076 --> 08:50.444
This is about me being
left out of the loop.

08:50.446 --> 08:52.580
I do need to talk.

08:52.582 --> 08:54.582
And maybe if we had
talked more,

08:54.584 --> 08:57.718
I could have prepared
myself for this.

08:59.822 --> 09:01.422
(Both sigh heavily)

09:05.561 --> 09:08.396
Look at your little doll lips.

09:15.238 --> 09:17.471
JENNIFER: Thank you for installing
the ramp at the post office,

09:17.473 --> 09:19.573
but it's a little steep.

09:19.575 --> 09:21.442
I've tried it twice,
and both times,

09:21.444 --> 09:23.778
I've been sort of shot back
into traffic.

09:23.780 --> 09:26.347
ROLAND: Yeah, but see the thing
with a ramp is,

09:26.349 --> 09:27.948
it's kind of a momentum thing,

09:27.950 --> 09:29.450
You really gotta you know,
give it a--

09:29.452 --> 09:31.319
MOIRA: Attention please,
council!

09:31.321 --> 09:33.621
I have a concern.

09:33.623 --> 09:35.823
- I was just hoping
to be interrupted

09:35.825 --> 09:37.591
by a concerned citizen.

09:37.593 --> 09:40.628
Would you like to be added
to the agenda, Moira?

09:40.630 --> 09:42.963
- No need, I'm prepared
to speak now.

09:42.965 --> 09:44.498
BOB: Well, that just doesn't
work, I mean,

09:44.500 --> 09:46.600
we have a list, uh...

09:46.602 --> 09:48.769
- Bob, just concentrate
on the minutes, okay?

09:48.771 --> 09:50.771
I can tell right now
you're behind.

09:50.773 --> 09:53.007
- Okay, typing is not
my strong suit.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.709
Ray could type without
looking at the keys.

09:54.711 --> 09:57.211
- This will take but a moment.

09:57.213 --> 09:59.513
I can't imagine you have anything
more pressing this afternoon.

09:59.515 --> 10:02.850
- Well, actually,
Jennifer had the floor.

10:04.754 --> 10:06.554
- Hello.

10:06.556 --> 10:09.724
You could've spoken up.

10:09.726 --> 10:12.493
Excuse me.

10:12.495 --> 10:14.528
- David, if you're going
out again,

10:14.530 --> 10:16.564
can you pick up some new
toilet paper?

10:16.566 --> 10:19.200
I cannot use the stuff
the motel provides, okay?

10:19.202 --> 10:20.568
It's like a birthday streamer.

10:20.570 --> 10:22.103
You-you- it stretches,

10:22.105 --> 10:24.805
and then- and then you pull it,
and it just snaps, okay?

10:24.807 --> 10:26.874
That-that whole thing
just fell off the roller!

10:26.876 --> 10:30.111
- Wow, um, Dad,
you remember Stevie.

10:32.582 --> 10:34.348
- Yes, yes, I remember Stevie.

10:34.350 --> 10:36.951
I know Stevie.
I knew Stevie was here.

10:36.953 --> 10:39.754
That's why I came in with something funny.
- Hmm.

10:39.756 --> 10:42.723
Oh yeah, sure.
- What's this? Looks expensive.

10:42.725 --> 10:45.793
- Oh, this is some new bedding.

10:45.795 --> 10:49.597
- David, didn't I just...
tell you to save your money?

10:49.599 --> 10:50.998
- Uh, yeah.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.666
I am testing this out
for the store,

10:52.668 --> 10:55.736
so work is paying for it.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.605
- Work is paying for your
bedding?

10:57.607 --> 11:00.775
- I was gonna leave,
but now I don't want to.

11:00.777 --> 11:03.611
- What is that?
Is that a new lamp?

11:03.613 --> 11:06.080
- Yeah, I'm thinking
of bringing homeware

11:06.082 --> 11:09.784
into the store,
so that's a write off.

11:09.786 --> 11:11.652
- That's a write off?
- Yeah.

11:11.654 --> 11:13.421
- Do you even know
what a write off is?!

11:13.423 --> 11:16.590
- Uh yeah, it's when you buy
something for your business

11:16.592 --> 11:18.292
and the government
pays you back for it.

11:18.294 --> 11:20.861
- Oh, and who pays for it?

11:20.863 --> 11:24.231
- Nobody, you write it off.

11:24.233 --> 11:25.699
- Who writes it off?!

11:25.701 --> 11:28.102
- I don't know, the govern--
the "write off" people!

11:28.104 --> 11:30.171
Why are we having this
conversation?

11:30.173 --> 11:32.807
STEVIE: So if I need booze
to get through my day,

11:32.809 --> 11:35.743
I can just write that off?
- That's a stretch.

11:35.745 --> 11:37.478
- But the skin care products
you got this morning,

11:37.480 --> 11:39.980
those are a write off.

11:39.982 --> 11:41.916
- What skin care products? You
purchased skin care products?!

11:41.918 --> 11:45.953
- Okay, okay.
I am the face of the company.

11:45.955 --> 11:49.023
If I have acne, what does
that say about the legitimacy

11:49.025 --> 11:50.858
of the store?

11:50.860 --> 11:53.027
- That's not a write off!

11:53.029 --> 11:55.095
That's not a write off!

11:55.097 --> 11:57.965
This?! Not a write off!

11:57.967 --> 12:00.734
- Oh, well, the bedding's
non refundable, so.

12:00.736 --> 12:04.839
- David, a write off
is a business expense

12:04.841 --> 12:08.442
used to reduce your taxable
income!

12:08.444 --> 12:12.480
- Okay, well then why isn't it
called a "tax write off?"

12:12.482 --> 12:14.582
- It is!

12:14.584 --> 12:16.750
It is, you can't just buy
things for yourself,

12:16.752 --> 12:18.819
and write them off!

12:20.790 --> 12:23.724
- Well then, I'll return some
things.

12:23.726 --> 12:26.627
There's not enough space in here
for the massage chair, anyway.

12:26.629 --> 12:27.995
STEVIE: I should get back
to work.

12:27.997 --> 12:31.765
Just in case any more
of your packages arrive.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.502
(Johnny groans)

12:34.504 --> 12:35.970
- (Mocking groan)

12:37.306 --> 12:39.840
MOIRA: I am here to address
an issue that I believe

12:39.842 --> 12:42.710
pertains to all of us:
self-respect.

12:42.712 --> 12:44.845
(Ronnie snickers)

12:44.847 --> 12:46.780
- I don't think we can help you
in that department.

12:46.782 --> 12:48.682
(Ronnie and Roland chuckle)

12:48.684 --> 12:50.651
- I'm speaking about
what we have allowed

12:50.653 --> 12:52.786
to happen to this town.

12:52.788 --> 12:54.955
Everyone leaving their old
things here and there,

12:54.957 --> 12:57.525
like some city-wide
garage sale!

12:57.527 --> 13:00.160
I deserve better!

13:00.162 --> 13:02.396
We deserve better.

13:03.900 --> 13:06.800
A baby born in a prison cell
does not know

13:06.802 --> 13:08.736
that a toilet should not
be in the same room

13:08.738 --> 13:10.704
as its bed, but we do.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.873
- I didn't know you'd been
in prison.

13:12.875 --> 13:16.010
- What? No, I'm illustrating
a point.

13:16.012 --> 13:19.613
Okay, picture all of you
living in a cave,

13:19.615 --> 13:22.149
having never seen the outside
world...

13:22.151 --> 13:24.785
and then I show up.

13:24.787 --> 13:26.854
No, this is not what
I'm trying to say.

13:26.856 --> 13:28.722
- What are you trying to say?

13:28.724 --> 13:30.824
- That we should strive
for something

13:30.826 --> 13:33.694
that sets us apart
from the prison baby.

13:33.696 --> 13:35.763
Greenery! We need greenery!

13:35.765 --> 13:38.732
Flowers, boxwood trees!

13:38.734 --> 13:42.002
Two sets each for the cafe,
and the motel.

13:42.004 --> 13:43.904
And then a citywide clean up,

13:43.906 --> 13:47.007
and I will not take no
for an answer.

13:50.947 --> 13:54.915
- Yeah well, I was actually
just gonna suggest that.

13:54.917 --> 13:58.018
before you suggested it.

13:58.020 --> 13:59.219
- Thank you.

13:59.221 --> 14:01.722
BOB: So there was just one baby
in prison,

14:01.724 --> 14:03.891
or there were more?

14:05.428 --> 14:07.728
(Car rumbles)

14:07.730 --> 14:10.864
- Did you lose weight?
- I shaved my beard.

14:10.866 --> 14:13.968
- Oh, I like it.
You look younger.

14:13.970 --> 14:16.837
- Thank you, Twyla.
That means a lot.

14:16.839 --> 14:18.772
- So, what can I get you guys?

14:18.774 --> 14:21.609
- Um, what's the cake today?

14:21.611 --> 14:23.711
- I'm sorry, did you just
ask for cake?

14:23.713 --> 14:25.779
I'm not used to you
ordering solid food.

14:25.781 --> 14:28.015
- Yeah, I'll just have
a slice of whatever.

14:31.654 --> 14:33.153
- I guess I'm having cake.

14:33.155 --> 14:35.689
- (Twyla chuckles)

14:35.691 --> 14:37.891
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

14:43.566 --> 14:47.001
I don't know, I just feel like
something's changed...

14:47.003 --> 14:48.268
with us.

14:50.039 --> 14:51.472
- Huh.

14:53.743 --> 14:55.976
- What are you thinking?

14:57.647 --> 14:58.979
- I don't know if anything's
changed.

14:58.981 --> 15:01.749
I think maybe we know
each other better now.

15:01.751 --> 15:03.751
Maybe that's the problem.

15:03.753 --> 15:05.919
- No, no, I'm not saying
that there's a problem,

15:05.921 --> 15:08.822
I'm just saying that there
are definitely a few things

15:08.824 --> 15:10.824
between us that need
to be adjusted

15:10.826 --> 15:13.727
in order to make
this work for us.

15:13.729 --> 15:17.865
Like maybe I need to talk less
and listen more,

15:17.867 --> 15:21.435
and you need to talk more,
and listen less.

15:25.107 --> 15:28.108
- And are you willing to make
these adjustments?

15:28.110 --> 15:29.910
- Well...

15:32.481 --> 15:34.848
Are you?

15:34.850 --> 15:36.617
- Uh...
TWYLA: I brought two forks.

15:36.619 --> 15:38.952
Just in case you wanted
to share.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.063
- S... (Small chuckle)

16:02.978 --> 16:04.945
(Laughs)

16:15.558 --> 16:17.057
Hmm.

16:19.995 --> 16:21.395
Yeah.

16:34.844 --> 16:37.878
(Both sigh)

16:39.115 --> 16:40.981
- Be careful on those stairs!

16:40.983 --> 16:43.984
Hey, next order of business,
we install a ramp here.

16:43.986 --> 16:45.919
- Hey!
- Hmm?

16:45.921 --> 16:48.088
- You really put Roland
on the spot there.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.858
- I was simply exercising
a basic human right.

16:50.860 --> 16:52.893
- Yeah, and I don't disagree
with you.

16:52.895 --> 16:54.495
- I've always known
you were on my side.

16:54.497 --> 16:57.131
- I wouldn't go that far.
But I will say this,

16:57.133 --> 17:00.234
usually these council
decisions, they take weeks.

17:00.236 --> 17:01.969
- Oh, I won't wait
for anyone's decision.

17:01.971 --> 17:03.937
I once got Winnie Mandela
to RSVP

17:03.939 --> 17:07.508
to an "Artists Against Eczema"
benefit within the hour.

17:07.510 --> 17:11.445
- You're a pain in the ass,
but you get stuff done.

17:11.447 --> 17:14.348
- A delightful compliment.
- Hmm, but those boxwood trees?

17:14.350 --> 17:15.916
- Oh yes, two sets,

17:15.918 --> 17:17.751
and if you know a good
ceramicist...

17:17.753 --> 17:20.020
- I would lower your
expectations.

17:20.022 --> 17:22.890
You're lucky if you get
some daisies in a planter.

17:22.892 --> 17:25.125
But good work.
- Thank you.

17:26.629 --> 17:27.995
- Eczema benefit?

17:27.997 --> 17:30.697
- Yes, you try enjoying
a puff pastry

17:30.699 --> 17:34.134
with everyone around you
scratching.

17:34.136 --> 17:35.736
- Ew!

17:35.738 --> 17:38.138
(Crickets chirp)

17:40.176 --> 17:42.242
- Ugh!

17:44.747 --> 17:46.680
(Door shuts)

17:52.955 --> 17:54.822
- What's going on?

17:54.824 --> 17:57.524
- I think Mutt and I ended
things.

17:57.526 --> 17:59.993
- You think? Okay, here's
a serious question:

17:59.995 --> 18:04.598
are you capable of making
an executive decision?

18:04.600 --> 18:06.533
- It's done.

18:08.671 --> 18:10.470
- Um... what happened?

18:12.875 --> 18:15.776
- I don't know, like, we were
talking, and then we just...

18:15.778 --> 18:18.912
like, didn't talk
for a long time.

18:18.914 --> 18:21.148
- Okay. And that's it?

18:23.052 --> 18:25.886
- No, and then we talked about
why we weren't talking.

18:25.888 --> 18:30.958
And then we both agreed that
even though the sex was amazing--

18:30.960 --> 18:33.227
- Mhmm.
- Like, amazing!

18:35.664 --> 18:38.565
There was this time in the barn where
I climbed up onto this rafter--

18:38.567 --> 18:41.335
- But yeah, no,
I think-I think we're good.

18:41.337 --> 18:44.938
- Yeah, anyway, we both
agreed that we'd just been

18:44.940 --> 18:47.841
lusting after each other
for such a long time

18:47.843 --> 18:51.144
that that's what we were
holding onto,

18:51.146 --> 18:54.848
and not what was right
in front of us.

18:54.850 --> 18:57.818
- Which was what?
- What?

18:57.820 --> 18:59.820
- What was right
in front of you?

18:59.822 --> 19:01.889
- When?
- Okay.

19:01.891 --> 19:03.891
- Okay. So anyway, it's done.

19:03.893 --> 19:06.093
And it's just really weird,

19:06.095 --> 19:08.862
because I've never felt
anything after a break up.

19:08.864 --> 19:10.264
- Mhmm.
- Like, nothing.

19:10.266 --> 19:12.032
Like, I've been to doctors
about it.

19:12.034 --> 19:14.902
- Mhmm...
- But this time, it's different.

19:14.904 --> 19:17.070
- Well, that's good.

19:18.874 --> 19:22.676
- I think he changed me a bit.

19:22.678 --> 19:25.913
Like he knows me.

19:25.915 --> 19:29.583
I let him know me. You know?

19:33.055 --> 19:36.957
I think I need a hug,
or something.

19:36.959 --> 19:38.926
- W-You what?

19:38.928 --> 19:40.794
- I need a hug.

19:40.796 --> 19:42.796
- Uh... uh...

19:42.798 --> 19:44.064
- David, will you please
give me a hug?

19:44.066 --> 19:45.666
- Oh, okay, yes, yeah.

19:55.844 --> 19:57.945
- Did you get new bedding?

19:57.947 --> 19:59.379
- Um, yeah, I did.

20:00.983 --> 20:02.950
But it's a write off,
so I don't--

20:02.952 --> 20:05.085
Anyway.

20:11.894 --> 20:14.828
- David, Alexis!

20:14.830 --> 20:17.331
Could you come out here,
please?

20:21.770 --> 20:23.136
David, Alexis!

20:23.138 --> 20:26.073
Come see this!
- What?

20:26.075 --> 20:29.710
- Honestly, John,
it's not worth it.

20:29.712 --> 20:32.679
- Your mother has done something
we can all be proud of.

20:32.681 --> 20:34.147
- Oh, did you pick up
that random condom

20:34.149 --> 20:35.716
that was on the grass there?

20:35.718 --> 20:37.417
- Ew yeah, whose was that?
- I have no idea.

20:37.419 --> 20:39.019
- No, that's not it. Not it.

20:39.021 --> 20:40.721
- They'll never see it.

20:40.723 --> 20:42.222
Throw it on the long list
of things I've done

20:42.224 --> 20:44.091
for my children
they don't appreciate.

20:44.093 --> 20:48.128
- Your mother had these
boxwoods put in.

20:48.130 --> 20:52.566
- Weren't those here before?
- There was literally nothing here.

20:52.568 --> 20:54.067
It was a wasteland.

20:54.069 --> 20:55.736
- Weren't there more plants
here before?

20:55.738 --> 20:58.872
- No, there weren't!
And there are more around town.

20:58.874 --> 21:01.108
- Thanks to your mother.

21:01.110 --> 21:04.611
- That's great.

21:04.613 --> 21:07.848
- (Whimpers) Okay.

21:07.850 --> 21:09.483
- Are we good with the plants, or?
- Can we go? Yeah.

21:09.485 --> 21:11.084
- Yeah, we're good.
DAVID AND ALEXIS: Okay.

21:11.086 --> 21:12.419
- Oh, there's the condom
right there, David.

21:12.421 --> 21:15.422
- Ew! <u> - Eww!</u> (Door slams)
