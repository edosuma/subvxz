WEBVTT

00:06.458 --> 00:07.417
Mom!

00:07.500 --> 00:08.750
Where's my jacket?

00:08.834 --> 00:10.792
'Where'd you put it, Stevie?'

00:10.875 --> 00:12.500
Quit calling me that.

00:12.583 --> 00:14.083
And I don't remember.

00:14.166 --> 00:16.959
'Check the hallway closet.'

00:18.792 --> 00:22.041
- Damn it!
- Watch the language, mister.

00:25.583 --> 00:27.208
Oh, mom.

00:27.291 --> 00:29.250
Mom, you found my jacket.

00:29.333 --> 00:32.917
You're the best mom in
the whole wide world.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.959
Go, scat, get
out of here.

00:35.041 --> 00:37.083
You're gonna be late.

00:37.166 --> 00:38.166
Where's dad?

00:38.250 --> 00:40.291
Ed, Stevie's going now!

00:40.375 --> 00:42.041
(Ed)
'Hold on a minute! Don't go!'

00:42.125 --> 00:45.000
Can anyone in this house
just talk at a normal level?

00:45.083 --> 00:46.709
Say cheese.

00:48.542 --> 00:50.333
Doesn't he look
handsome, Ed?

00:50.417 --> 00:52.709
Mom, don't get
all weepy.
Jeez.

00:52.792 --> 00:53.959
Wear your seatbelt tonight.

00:54.041 --> 00:55.959
It's pouring cats,
and dogs out there.

00:56.041 --> 00:57.375
Better get out
of here before mom

00:57.458 --> 00:59.458
decides she's going
to the prom with
you.

00:59.542 --> 01:02.500
Okay, parental units,
I'm out of here.

01:02.583 --> 01:04.750
Don't forget your keys.

01:08.709 --> 01:10.583
The Caddy?

01:12.417 --> 01:13.792
Are you serious, dad?

01:13.875 --> 01:16.125
Could be making the
biggest
mistake of my life.

01:18.542 --> 01:21.083
- Thanks, dad.
- Have a great time, son.

01:21.166 --> 01:22.667
Be careful.

01:28.083 --> 01:29.709
Bye.

01:29.792 --> 01:31.542
Bye.

03:11.542 --> 03:14.000
- 'Are you a detective?'
- Yeah.

03:15.375 --> 03:16.917
Can I help you?

03:18.000 --> 03:20.959
I have
information
on a murder.

03:21.041 --> 03:23.125
The boy who died.

03:25.542 --> 03:28.792
His name was
Steve
Jablonski.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.375
Jablonski.

03:31.458 --> 03:33.500
Sounds familiar.

03:33.583 --> 03:36.750
He was buried
alive
26 years ago.

03:39.375 --> 03:41.041
Right, um..

03:41.125 --> 03:42.250
That was horrible.

03:42.333 --> 03:44.875
Yes, it was.

03:44.959 --> 03:46.667
You got some information?

03:54.208 --> 03:56.500
I buried him with this.

04:38.709 --> 04:40.792
Think this guy's for real?

04:40.875 --> 04:42.500
Depends on that
shovel head.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.166
Lab say how long
it'll take?

04:44.250 --> 04:45.542
A couple hours, maybe.

04:45.625 --> 04:47.125
Job went cold day one.

04:47.208 --> 04:50.166
'Been going through
Jablonski's box.'

04:50.250 --> 04:51.500
Pretty grim stuff.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.083
Check this out.

04:53.166 --> 04:55.417
Doer made the kid write
out his own will.

04:55.500 --> 04:58.542
Sent it to Jablonski's
parents.

04:58.625 --> 05:01.208
"My name is Steve Jablonski.

05:01.291 --> 05:03.041
"This is my last
will and testament.

05:03.125 --> 05:06.000
"Mom, don't worry, because
he promised it won't hurt.

05:06.083 --> 05:08.542
"It'll just be like
falling asleep.

05:08.625 --> 05:10.500
"I'm sorry about the car, dad.

05:10.583 --> 05:13.291
"Please don't let this
get you down, because I know

05:13.375 --> 05:15.709
"one day we'll meet in heaven."

05:17.709 --> 05:19.291
Parents found it
in their mailbox

05:19.375 --> 05:21.375
a few hours after their
son's body turned up.

05:21.458 --> 05:23.041
Oh, that's tough.

05:23.125 --> 05:25.667
Cops never went
public with it.

05:25.750 --> 05:28.542
And now the doer
waltzes
in 26 years later.

05:28.625 --> 05:30.667
Uh, if he's the doer.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Go find out.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.125
Cold out tonight.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.291
Yeah.

05:46.375 --> 05:48.166
I hate the rain.

05:49.375 --> 05:51.500
So what's your name?

05:52.709 --> 05:54.041
John Doe.

05:55.375 --> 05:57.417
That's original.

05:57.500 --> 06:00.417
- And you are?
- Detective Rush.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.458
Lilly Rush.

06:02.542 --> 06:05.083
I want you to
know
that I feel
terrible

06:05.166 --> 06:07.750
about what happened
to that boy.

06:07.834 --> 06:09.792
So why'd you kill him?

06:11.333 --> 06:14.291
Couldn't help
it.
I'm sorry.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.458
Such a nice kid.

06:17.542 --> 06:19.333
So worried
about
his dad.

06:19.417 --> 06:23.208
'Too bad I was the one
who stopped to help.'

06:23.291 --> 06:25.375
Yeah. Too bad.

06:25.458 --> 06:28.250
We spent a lot of time..

06:28.333 --> 06:30.500
...talking about dying.

06:30.583 --> 06:33.834
About...saying goodbye.

06:35.834 --> 06:37.417
Goodbye?

06:38.750 --> 06:41.166
People lose a loved
one and they grieve.

06:41.250 --> 06:44.417
When you're the one
dying, you lose
everyone.

06:45.375 --> 06:47.792
Ever experience that?

06:47.875 --> 06:49.792
No.

06:49.875 --> 06:51.375
Can't say I have.

06:51.458 --> 06:52.792
Steve did.

06:52.875 --> 06:55.375
It was a
heartbreaking
thing to watch.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.000
Uh, let me level
with you, John.

06:58.083 --> 07:00.500
You haven't told me anything
the public doesn't know
already.

07:00.583 --> 07:03.834
So why should I believe
that you did it?

07:05.959 --> 07:08.208
You look at me

07:08.291 --> 07:11.625
and you see a
quiet,
simple man.

07:13.417 --> 07:15.834
So did he.

07:15.917 --> 07:17.917
Didn't believe me

07:19.083 --> 07:21.583
when I told him he
was going to die.

07:33.166 --> 07:34.667
Can I give you
a lift somewhere?

07:34.750 --> 07:37.792
Yeah, there's a gas station
down off Route 291?

07:37.875 --> 07:39.709
Sure. Get in.

07:42.041 --> 07:44.041
I'm Steve, by the way.

07:44.125 --> 07:45.792
Dripping all over
your car. Sorry.

07:45.875 --> 07:47.667
Not a problem.

07:47.750 --> 07:49.792
Call me John.

07:53.125 --> 07:54.959
Looks like you're
headed to a formal.

07:55.041 --> 07:56.542
My prom.

07:56.625 --> 07:58.291
So you must be what?

07:58.375 --> 08:00.250
17, 18, Steve?

08:00.333 --> 08:02.458
'17, yeah.'

08:04.625 --> 08:06.291
Great age.

08:07.583 --> 08:10.250
Guess that makes you
almost legal, huh?

08:10.333 --> 08:13.500
What? You think,
I poisoned it?

08:15.917 --> 08:17.166
Nah.

08:18.208 --> 08:19.500
Thanks.

08:21.166 --> 08:23.667
To getting
to the
prom.

08:23.750 --> 08:25.875
To getting to the prom.

08:30.542 --> 08:33.542
Uh, that's the turn off
for the gas station.

08:35.458 --> 08:36.458
Excuse me?

08:36.542 --> 08:38.458
You just passed it.

08:42.250 --> 08:44.458
I hate to tell you this, Steve

08:46.291 --> 08:49.667
but you're going
to die tonight.

08:49.750 --> 08:51.792
That's funny.

08:52.625 --> 08:54.625
How do you feel?

08:55.667 --> 08:57.417
Knowing that.

08:59.291 --> 09:00.917
Could you just
turn around please?

09:01.000 --> 09:04.834
I put something in your beer.

09:04.917 --> 09:06.625
I had to.

09:06.709 --> 09:08.458
'I'm sorry I lied.'

09:08.542 --> 09:10.834
In a few moments
you'll be unconscious.

09:12.417 --> 09:14.583
It won't hurt.

09:14.667 --> 09:16.041
I think we should go back.

09:16.125 --> 09:19.125
My dad will be really
mad about the car.

09:23.041 --> 09:26.166
I knew you'd try that, so
I removed the door handle.

09:28.834 --> 09:30.041
There's no
point in
trying

09:30.125 --> 09:33.000
to escape or
trying to
scream.

09:38.375 --> 09:41.166
No one can hear you for miles.

09:45.166 --> 09:47.166
And then you killed him.

09:49.166 --> 09:52.291
Detective Rush.
Now I remember that name

09:52.375 --> 09:53.792
you were in the
newspapers last
year.

09:53.875 --> 09:56.250
You caught that
serial killer.

09:59.750 --> 10:02.000
- You gettin' off on this?
- Pardon me?

10:02.083 --> 10:05.500
Waltzing in here,
playing games, making crap up.

10:05.583 --> 10:06.709
I'm telling the truth.

10:06.792 --> 10:09.917
So tell me how
Steve said goodbye.

10:20.667 --> 10:22.875
Don't forget your
umbrella on the way out.

10:22.959 --> 10:25.834
"I'm sorry
about
the car, dad.

10:28.166 --> 10:31.208
"Please don't let
this get you down

10:31.291 --> 10:33.417
"because I know

10:33.500 --> 10:35.333
"one day

10:36.417 --> 10:38.792
"we'll meet in heaven".

10:42.750 --> 10:43.792
That's how.

10:45.458 --> 10:47.417
Something you gotta see.

10:53.875 --> 10:56.792
- The lab results came in,
Lill.
- Okay.

10:56.875 --> 10:59.750
They found fresh
dirt on the shovel.

11:04.709 --> 11:05.875
'You did it again.'

11:05.959 --> 11:07.709
Didn't you, John?

11:09.792 --> 11:12.291
There is another boy.

11:13.875 --> 11:15.583
Time ran out for Steve Jablonski

11:15.667 --> 11:17.583
but maybe not for this one.

11:20.166 --> 11:22.375
This boy's still alive?

11:22.458 --> 11:26.166
Steve lasted six hours
in the ground.

11:28.250 --> 11:30.583
Maybe he will, too.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.792
He kills once, stops for 26
years and then kills again?

11:40.875 --> 11:43.250
Right, but as far as we know,
this kid's still alive.

11:43.333 --> 11:44.875
'ME confirmed it took
about six hours'

11:44.959 --> 11:47.709
'before Jablonski
ran out of air.'

11:47.792 --> 11:49.125
We gotta hurry.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.166
- So what's the game plan?
- ID the missing kid.

11:51.250 --> 11:53.375
Probably 17 same age
as his first victim.

11:53.458 --> 11:56.125
Check missing persons reports.
Maybe get lucky.

11:56.208 --> 11:57.583
What about this
John Doe character?

11:57.667 --> 11:58.959
Guy had no ID, wallet

11:59.041 --> 12:00.792
nothing with his
address on it.

12:00.875 --> 12:02.834
- We ran his prints?
- 'No luck.'

12:02.917 --> 12:04.458
Jablonski's parents
are on their way up.

12:04.542 --> 12:05.750
Maybe they know him.

12:05.834 --> 12:07.792
In the meantime,
we keep him talking?

12:07.875 --> 12:09.125
'Right.'

12:09.208 --> 12:11.250
He only wants to talk
about the 1980 job.

12:11.333 --> 12:12.834
We find out why
he did that murder

12:12.917 --> 12:15.166
maybe we save this boy.

12:16.750 --> 12:18.333
So let's cut
to the chase, John.

12:18.417 --> 12:19.583
You tell me where
this boy is

12:19.667 --> 12:21.375
and I'll make sure
the DA cuts you a deal.

12:21.458 --> 12:22.667
I'm not interested in deals.

12:22.750 --> 12:23.834
That's not why I'm here.

12:23.917 --> 12:25.500
You're here about Jablonski.

12:25.583 --> 12:27.417
Why not tell us about
your other victims?

12:27.500 --> 12:30.333
There are no others.
Just him.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.166
And the boy out there now.

12:32.250 --> 12:34.542
- So what's your real name?
- It isn't important.

12:34.625 --> 12:36.250
You walk in here
confessing to a murder

12:36.333 --> 12:39.250
but you don't wanna
tell us who you are?

12:39.333 --> 12:40.917
What I'm wondering..

12:41.000 --> 12:45.333
...is, why wait 26 years
before you kill again?

12:45.417 --> 12:46.750
I mean, you must
have been, what?

12:46.834 --> 12:48.500
In your late 20s
with Jablonski?

12:48.583 --> 12:52.000
Knowing who I am isn't gonna
help you find him. I'm sorry.

12:52.083 --> 12:53.875
Why'd you make him
write his own will?

12:53.959 --> 12:57.333
People should have the chance
to put their affairs in order.

12:57.417 --> 12:59.250
To make sense of their lives.

13:00.250 --> 13:01.458
'To say goodbye.'

13:01.542 --> 13:04.041
Now, that's real standup.

13:04.125 --> 13:07.083
Anger is
stage
number two.

13:07.166 --> 13:08.208
Excuse me?

13:08.291 --> 13:10.625
Like you.

13:10.709 --> 13:12.917
He got angry, too.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.709
What happened?

13:24.792 --> 13:26.375
You're going to die tonight.

13:26.458 --> 13:28.125
'Remember?'

13:31.667 --> 13:33.875
The Caddy.

13:33.959 --> 13:36.125
The Caddy. I-I can't
just leave it there.

13:36.208 --> 13:38.375
It's, like, his most
prized possession.

13:38.458 --> 13:41.000
Who? Your father?

13:41.083 --> 13:45.709
I got my grades up, and I
spent
weekends working on the yard.

13:45.792 --> 13:48.750
- So he'd trust you with it.
- You gotta turn around.

13:48.834 --> 13:52.792
My dad, he'll think I messed
up again. It's not true.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.458
Sounds like you've been a
disappointment to your father.

14:00.125 --> 14:01.709
You gotta turn around!

14:07.375 --> 14:09.458
Why are you doing this to me?

14:10.667 --> 14:12.667
To know what it's like to die.

14:12.750 --> 14:14.583
Why me?

14:18.500 --> 14:22.250
You said anger was
stage number two.

14:22.333 --> 14:23.583
Stage two of what?

14:23.667 --> 14:25.750
The five stages of dying.

14:25.834 --> 14:28.166
The first is denial.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.500
Then anger.

14:31.583 --> 14:32.500
Then bargaining.

14:32.583 --> 14:34.917
Depression
and acceptance.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.583
I'm familiar.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.125
I'm sorry.

14:39.208 --> 14:41.500
Keep your condolences, please.

14:43.542 --> 14:48.542
Their final thoughts,
feelings.

14:48.625 --> 14:50.750
You'll never know
what they were.

14:52.208 --> 14:55.417
'You wish you
did, don't you?'

14:55.500 --> 14:58.166
Steve Jablonski's mother
and father got to.

14:58.250 --> 15:01.375
So stage number three
is bargaining, John.

15:02.875 --> 15:04.166
You know what we want.

15:04.250 --> 15:06.333
What about you?

15:06.417 --> 15:08.083
I wanna meet them.

15:08.166 --> 15:10.417
Who?

15:10.500 --> 15:12.291
Jablonski's parents.

15:13.375 --> 15:15.208
'Why?'

15:15.291 --> 15:18.417
[sighs]
To tell them, I'm sorry.

15:25.125 --> 15:28.709
I used to dream
about this moment

15:28.792 --> 15:30.709
fantasize about it.

15:32.583 --> 15:35.417
What I would do
to you if we met.

15:36.917 --> 15:38.583
'But now I know
that won't'

15:38.667 --> 15:41.792
ever bring my boy
back, will it?

15:45.250 --> 15:47.834
You left him alone.

15:49.375 --> 15:51.500
In that place.

15:51.583 --> 15:54.291
Steve chose that playground.

15:56.208 --> 15:58.166
Do you want to know why?

15:59.709 --> 16:01.709
Tell me. Please.

16:01.792 --> 16:03.583
When he was ten years
old, he told me

16:03.667 --> 16:07.667
that's where he,
he hit his first home run.

16:09.291 --> 16:12.000
'And that it was the
only time in his life'

16:12.083 --> 16:13.834
'that he knew..'

16:14.792 --> 16:16.375
Knew what?

16:16.458 --> 16:18.583
That you were proud of him.

16:23.959 --> 16:27.542
Look.. Tell me, tell me
what it was like

16:27.625 --> 16:30.083
for him at the end.

16:31.959 --> 16:33.792
Are you sure you want to know?

16:33.875 --> 16:36.041
I need to know.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.166
Are you sure?

16:52.000 --> 16:53.458
(Steve)
'You want money?'

16:53.542 --> 16:55.875
Is that it?
Is that what you
want?

16:59.542 --> 17:02.917
''Cause my family they-they've
got money lots of it.'

17:03.000 --> 17:06.458
They'll pay anything you
want, I swear they will.

17:06.542 --> 17:08.709
Are you ready to put
your affairs in order?

17:08.792 --> 17:12.542
My dad is a lawyer. He will
do anything to get me back.

17:12.625 --> 17:14.875
Are you ready to say
your final goodbyes?

17:16.041 --> 17:19.417
Just tell me
what you want.

17:19.500 --> 17:22.917
I want you to think about how
to say goodbye in your will.

17:24.375 --> 17:27.166
Your last will
and testament.

17:27.250 --> 17:28.959
If you let me go.

17:30.458 --> 17:32.208
I won't tell.

17:32.291 --> 17:33.792
I swear to God, not a soul.

17:33.875 --> 17:36.166
You can just
drive off.

17:36.250 --> 17:38.250
What do you say?

17:46.375 --> 17:48.250
I'll do..

17:49.750 --> 17:52.500
...you know..

17:52.583 --> 17:53.959
...that.

17:54.041 --> 17:56.291
What, Steve?

17:56.375 --> 17:58.458
It'll just
blow
your mind

17:58.542 --> 17:59.875
what I'll do like..

17:59.959 --> 18:02.417
If you..

18:02.500 --> 18:05.125
Just please
don't hurt
me.

18:07.125 --> 18:08.709
Mom.

18:10.667 --> 18:12.333
- I'll kill you!
- Lynne, Lynne!

18:12.417 --> 18:15.500
- What's wrong with you.
- 'I didn't mean to upset
you.'

18:15.583 --> 18:16.875
I'll kill you.

18:16.959 --> 18:18.834
I told you that because
your boy was lucky.

18:18.917 --> 18:21.834
- You should go. Please.
- Don't listen to him.

18:21.917 --> 18:23.458
Some people don't have
a loving family

18:23.542 --> 18:26.917
and a cozy home to say goodbye
to, but Steve did.

18:28.083 --> 18:29.542
We held up our end.

18:29.625 --> 18:31.333
Now it's your turn.

18:32.375 --> 18:34.291
'Where is he?'

18:35.458 --> 18:38.583
Some people just have
a locker to call home.

18:40.208 --> 18:42.667
And a vent to keep
them warm at night.

18:42.750 --> 18:45.542
You talking
about
yourself, John?

18:45.625 --> 18:47.500
Or him?

18:49.875 --> 18:51.792
A locker to call home.

18:51.875 --> 18:54.875
This boy's what?
Homeless? Runaway?

18:54.959 --> 18:57.542
A vent keeping them
warm at night.

18:57.625 --> 19:01.417
- Subway station?
- Or a train station.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.417
30th Street?

19:08.709 --> 19:11.542
Guy's the invisible man.
No one's seen squat.

19:11.625 --> 19:13.583
If this John Doe
was even here.

19:13.667 --> 19:15.041
Could be a
wild goose chase.

19:15.125 --> 19:16.750
Heating vents, lockers.

19:16.834 --> 19:18.041
You got a better idea?

19:18.125 --> 19:20.375
This guy could be
jerking us around.

19:20.458 --> 19:22.375
Better than doing nothing
'cause
we're running out of time.

19:22.458 --> 19:24.834
Got less than four hours left.

19:24.917 --> 19:27.333
Put me in a room alone
with him, 20 minutes.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.750
I'll get John
Doe
talkin'.

19:29.834 --> 19:32.041
Son of a bitch.

19:32.125 --> 19:34.417
He led us right to it.

19:46.667 --> 19:47.667
That from our new kid?

19:47.750 --> 19:49.333
Found it taped
to this locker.

19:49.417 --> 19:52.417
All we got so far is his
name Justin Bradley.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.750
"This is my last
will and
testament.

19:54.834 --> 19:57.417
"Everything in my locker
goes to you, Valentino.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.917
"It's not much, but it's
all I got in the world.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.250
"Remember the horses
in the field?

20:02.333 --> 20:04.709
"Maybe we'll meet
there one day."

20:04.792 --> 20:06.917
- That's it.
- Who's Valentino?

20:07.000 --> 20:09.417
Vera and Miller
are asking around.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.125
Horses in the field.

20:11.208 --> 20:14.458
Could be, like,
Jablonski's
meet in heaven thing?

20:14.542 --> 20:15.834
Anything in the locker?

20:15.917 --> 20:18.041
Uh...sneakers, sweatshirt.

20:18.125 --> 20:20.000
'This box.'

20:25.709 --> 20:27.291
Why's he carrying this around?

20:27.375 --> 20:29.417
Vera found the
friend, Valentino.

20:29.500 --> 20:30.542
Picked him up a
few minutes ago

20:30.625 --> 20:33.625
right outside
the station.

20:33.709 --> 20:36.125
Me and Justin kick it
time to time. So what?

20:36.208 --> 20:38.208
(Nick)
'He work the train
station, too, Valentino?'

20:38.291 --> 20:39.542
You mean, is he hooking?

20:39.625 --> 20:41.208
Take a guess, chico.

20:41.291 --> 20:42.875
When did you
see him last?

20:42.959 --> 20:44.417
Earlier tonight.
I don't know.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.667
Was he with this guy?

20:46.750 --> 20:47.917
I ain't no snitch.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.166
Ask him your own damn self.

20:49.250 --> 20:52.417
Look, we think this
guy abducted your
buddy.

20:52.500 --> 20:53.709
We think he
might kill
him.

20:53.792 --> 20:56.959
So, from where we're
standing, chico.

20:57.041 --> 20:59.333
You got two options,
talk or take a ride

20:59.417 --> 21:01.208
'down to the morgue
in a few hours.'

21:01.291 --> 21:04.250
Cops, you're full
of more juice than Johns.

21:04.333 --> 21:06.500
It's all the same to you,
I gotta make a living here.

21:06.583 --> 21:08.500
"The horses in the field."

21:08.583 --> 21:09.792
Does that mean
anything to
you?

21:09.875 --> 21:10.875
Who told you that?

21:10.959 --> 21:13.667
Your friend
Justin in
this.

21:13.750 --> 21:16.458
See, this John you're working
so hard to protect?

21:16.542 --> 21:18.250
He makes his victims
write out their own wills

21:18.333 --> 21:20.542
before he kills 'em.

21:20.625 --> 21:21.834
I saw that guy.

21:21.917 --> 21:25.166
- A few hours ago.
- Yeah. What else?

21:26.875 --> 21:29.500
Justin was standing
right there

21:29.583 --> 21:31.667
talking about horses
in the field.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.000
Cheap bastards could
turn up the heat

21:35.083 --> 21:37.375
in their rides,
know what I'm saying?

21:37.458 --> 21:40.583
I'm jacking the next one and
riding off into the sunset.

21:40.667 --> 21:41.917
Yeah, sure.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.041
Two-bit hooker like you,
Justin, you'll get real far.

21:45.125 --> 21:48.208
If I take the back roads, the
cops will never catch me, boy.

21:48.291 --> 21:51.667
That's right. Saw it in that
movie, "Thelma and Louise."

21:53.125 --> 21:55.625
Those white girls end up
flying
off the cliff at the end.

21:55.709 --> 21:58.417
Is that how you want
to blaze out?

21:58.500 --> 21:59.709
Whatever.

21:59.792 --> 22:01.834
You're trippin'.

22:01.917 --> 22:03.208
At least I got a plan.

22:03.291 --> 22:05.917
You gonna get out
of here, is that it?

22:07.375 --> 22:09.083
That's it.

22:09.166 --> 22:11.291
<i>mi hijo?</i>

22:13.291 --> 22:15.417
Right here is
where you're at.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.208
Don't you forget it.

22:18.792 --> 22:21.166
There was this other place.

22:21.250 --> 22:23.250
My mom brought
me there once.

22:23.333 --> 22:25.250
When I was a kid.

22:25.333 --> 22:28.083
There were these
horses in a
field.

22:31.166 --> 22:33.250
That's where I'm going.

22:36.959 --> 22:39.375
You wanna come?

22:40.667 --> 22:43.417
- What?
- Forget it.

22:44.875 --> 22:46.458
Don't be scammin' my
lighter, yo, give it back.

22:46.542 --> 22:49.875
I don't want your
cheap-ass plastic light.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.458
Ask me again.

23:06.750 --> 23:08.834
- Grandpa's mine.
- Yeah.

23:08.917 --> 23:11.083
So I'll catch you
later or whatever.

23:11.166 --> 23:14.500
Yeah. Whatever.

23:27.750 --> 23:30.792
Rode off into the sunset.
That's all I know.

23:30.875 --> 23:33.000
And this guy was
in a green
minivan.

23:33.083 --> 23:34.875
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

23:34.959 --> 23:37.166
Got a look at his
license plate, too.

23:37.250 --> 23:39.375
W-E-J eight something.

23:39.458 --> 23:42.166
Like wedgie.
Whatever, right?

23:42.250 --> 23:45.625
Is there anything else you
can tell us about Justin?

23:45.709 --> 23:48.667
He was a runaway,
sick of foster homes.

23:48.750 --> 23:50.333
On his own since forever.

23:50.417 --> 23:51.667
He had you.

23:51.750 --> 23:55.667
Truth is, I met
Justin two weeks ago.

23:55.750 --> 23:57.834
Barely knew the kid.

24:01.917 --> 24:04.875
You a regular
at
the train
station?

24:06.083 --> 24:07.542
Hardly.

24:08.709 --> 24:12.000
- Sure about that?
- Yeah, positive.

24:12.083 --> 24:14.834
'Cause these two
kids, you know..

24:14.917 --> 24:17.834
...Wonder Bread suburbs boy

24:17.917 --> 24:19.917
'broke-ass nobody.'

24:21.166 --> 24:22.750
There's nothing
in common, right?

24:22.834 --> 24:25.417
- 'Right.'
- Hmm.

24:25.500 --> 24:27.458
Except..

24:27.542 --> 24:29.750
...they're both 17.

24:32.583 --> 24:34.375
It's a hell of an age.

24:34.458 --> 24:36.208
'Seventeen.'

24:37.792 --> 24:40.959
It was raining when
you picked him up tonight.

24:41.041 --> 24:44.041
- 'It was cold out?'
- Yes, it was very cold.

24:44.125 --> 24:46.333
'But your car is warm.'

24:46.417 --> 24:47.583
'It's dry.'

24:49.375 --> 24:50.542
Justin gets in.

24:50.625 --> 24:53.250
He's shivering.

24:53.333 --> 24:55.542
Maybe he's grateful

24:55.625 --> 24:56.583
for the warmth, maybe not.

24:56.667 --> 25:00.208
All that matters is..

25:00.291 --> 25:02.500
...he's this close.

25:02.583 --> 25:03.959
You can..

25:04.041 --> 25:07.458
...smell his skin..

25:07.542 --> 25:09.542
...his hair..

25:09.625 --> 25:11.583
...his breath.

25:11.667 --> 25:13.917
- Anything can happen.
- You're way off base.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.667
- You like teenage boys.
- That's not why I picked--

25:16.750 --> 25:18.458
When he begged for his
life
what'd you make Justin--

25:18.542 --> 25:22.083
- That's not why I picked him!
- Then why pick 17 year olds?

25:22.166 --> 25:25.375
Because the little bastards
think they'll live forever!

25:29.333 --> 25:31.750
But they won't.

25:33.542 --> 25:35.166
No.

25:35.250 --> 25:37.291
You make sure of that.

25:38.750 --> 25:42.583
In the end
they give up, too.

25:57.667 --> 25:59.333
Here.

26:01.458 --> 26:04.750
This is the place.

26:04.834 --> 26:08.083
Why do you want to die here?

26:08.166 --> 26:09.667
Who cares?

26:11.250 --> 26:13.458
You wanted me to pick
a place, so I did.

26:13.542 --> 26:15.458
There has to be a reason.

26:15.542 --> 26:17.417
There's no reason, okay?

26:18.750 --> 26:22.208
What are you waiting for?
Do it already. Kill me.

26:23.208 --> 26:26.417
I have to know, why here?

26:30.750 --> 26:32.667
Me and her.

26:35.250 --> 26:38.959
We rode the horses
in this field.

26:39.041 --> 26:41.542
'Before she got in
her car accident.'

26:45.250 --> 26:46.834
I was ten.

26:50.959 --> 26:54.166
My mom was all I
had in the world.

26:55.417 --> 26:57.083
And this place?

26:59.083 --> 27:02.041
Was where I mattered
to somebody once.

27:06.458 --> 27:09.125
He's so alone right now.

27:11.375 --> 27:13.917
Out there in the rain.

27:16.959 --> 27:19.917
If only someone
would find him.

27:27.375 --> 27:29.291
Boss wants you.

27:41.625 --> 27:42.959
We tracked down his registration

27:43.041 --> 27:44.834
off the license plate
Valentino gave us.

27:44.917 --> 27:46.208
- Who is he?
- John Harding, age 54.

27:46.291 --> 27:47.458
Divorced, father of two.

27:47.542 --> 27:50.083
- High school teacher.
- Who would've thought?

27:50.166 --> 27:53.500
Rush and Jeffries are
talking with his ex-wife.

28:00.083 --> 28:03.083
I haven't talked to my
ex-husband in almost a decade.

28:03.166 --> 28:04.959
I can't help you. I'm sorry.

28:05.041 --> 28:06.125
What about your sons?

28:06.208 --> 28:08.250
They were never close with him.

28:08.333 --> 28:11.250
After the divorce,
he just stopped coming by.

28:11.333 --> 28:12.875
Something else
you want to share?

28:12.959 --> 28:14.875
Not particularly.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.583
- How old are your sons?
- 'Jack is 16.'

28:18.667 --> 28:20.375
Stan is almost 18. Why?

28:20.458 --> 28:22.917
The boy that was killed,
and the one out there tonight

28:23.000 --> 28:24.458
they're the same age.

28:24.542 --> 28:27.375
'We're running out
of time, Mrs. Harding.'

28:30.875 --> 28:35.875
[sighs]
John called me this morning,
said the tremors had started.

28:35.959 --> 28:38.667
- Tremors?
- He said his time was
limited.

28:38.750 --> 28:41.834
The tremors signaled the
beginning of the end for him.

28:41.917 --> 28:44.166
What are you talking about?

28:44.250 --> 28:46.750
He didn't tell you?

28:47.875 --> 28:52.667
John has MS.
Multiple sclerosis.

28:52.750 --> 28:55.000
My ex-husband is dying.

29:04.375 --> 29:06.291
Multiple sclerosis.

29:06.375 --> 29:09.291
Your muscles atrophy,
you go blind, weak.

29:09.375 --> 29:11.125
It can take years

29:11.208 --> 29:14.500
until your mind's trapped
in a near-dead body.

29:14.583 --> 29:17.792
That's why you
bury them alive.

29:17.875 --> 29:21.166
You want to see them die
slowly, the way you're dying.

29:21.250 --> 29:23.625
- You may be right.
- 'The five stages of
death.'

29:23.709 --> 29:24.875
You weren't talking
about your victims

29:24.959 --> 29:26.333
you were talking
about yourself.

29:26.417 --> 29:28.667
'Diagnosed 26 years ago.'

29:28.750 --> 29:32.166
The same year Steve
goes missing.

29:32.250 --> 29:34.333
(Nick)
'Then you go into remission
think you got it beat.'

29:34.417 --> 29:37.333
One day your
hands are shaking..

29:37.417 --> 29:40.542
...and you know
it beat you.

29:40.625 --> 29:42.458
I see you
met
my ex-wife.

29:42.542 --> 29:45.333
You tell her about your
MS when you got married?

29:46.792 --> 29:50.333
'Didn't think so.
When did she find out?'

29:50.417 --> 29:52.208
When our first son was born.

29:52.291 --> 29:55.458
'Husband diagnosed with
a terminal disease.'

29:55.542 --> 29:59.709
She'd be a monster if she
dumped you, so she stayed.

29:59.792 --> 30:01.333
'Made do.'

30:02.417 --> 30:04.250
Settled.

30:04.333 --> 30:06.291
'Must've been
lonely, you dying'

30:06.375 --> 30:08.834
'seeing that pity
in her eyes.'

30:08.917 --> 30:10.667
She never pitied me.

30:10.750 --> 30:12.125
No.

30:12.208 --> 30:14.750
She just pretended
to still love you.

30:16.125 --> 30:19.125
'Takes something out
of you, pretending.'

30:19.208 --> 30:21.125
'You never get it back.'

30:21.208 --> 30:24.959
The years go by,
and one day you wake up, and..

30:27.458 --> 30:31.875
...you're both
strangers...and alone.

30:31.959 --> 30:34.083
(John)
'And that's why
you picked Steve.'

30:34.166 --> 30:35.792
Because he was young

30:35.875 --> 30:38.834
on top of the world,
the way you once were.

30:38.917 --> 30:43.333
And Justin he's
who you are now.

30:43.417 --> 30:45.959
Alone, afraid.

30:48.458 --> 30:50.667
Do you ever wonder..

30:52.166 --> 30:54.583
...what it must be like..

30:56.667 --> 30:58.583
Alone..

30:58.667 --> 31:01.208
...in the ground..

31:01.291 --> 31:03.583
...no going back?

31:03.667 --> 31:06.542
The final stage.

31:06.625 --> 31:08.333
Finally..

31:09.625 --> 31:11.792
...having to accept..

31:17.875 --> 31:19.458
Remember..

31:20.834 --> 31:22.959
...the horses in the field?

31:25.959 --> 31:28.291
Maybe we'll meet
there someday.

31:30.500 --> 31:33.709
You make sure that
Valentino gets it?

31:33.792 --> 31:35.458
I will.

31:37.834 --> 31:39.667
You ready?

31:39.750 --> 31:41.291
No.

31:42.709 --> 31:44.458
Not yet.

31:46.125 --> 31:48.125
It's so cold.

31:49.417 --> 31:51.375
I can't stop shaking.

31:51.458 --> 31:53.750
It's gonna be okay.

31:55.583 --> 31:57.291
Will it hurt?

31:57.375 --> 32:00.083
After a while, it's just..

32:00.166 --> 32:03.208
...quiet, still.

32:04.166 --> 32:06.834
'Like falling asleep.'

32:06.917 --> 32:10.917
I want things to be...still.

32:13.917 --> 32:17.417
There are so many
things
I should have done.

32:17.500 --> 32:20.208
'I should have said.'

32:20.291 --> 32:23.750
I should have asked
Valentino one more
time.

32:23.834 --> 32:26.166
Asked him what?

32:27.792 --> 32:30.166
Do you wanna come?

32:34.917 --> 32:37.500
You ready, Justin?

32:37.583 --> 32:39.083
If I see my mom in heaven.

32:39.166 --> 32:41.375
Do you think she'll
remember me?

33:04.959 --> 33:06.333
What is it?

33:07.583 --> 33:09.166
The music.

33:10.834 --> 33:12.834
Can you hear?

33:15.583 --> 33:18.375
'The horses in the field.'

33:18.458 --> 33:21.083
That was the music playing.

33:24.166 --> 33:26.417
I remember that music.

33:34.166 --> 33:36.542
I'm ready now.

33:40.875 --> 33:43.542
I think, in the end..

33:45.208 --> 33:47.250
...he accepted.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.417
Is that where Justin is?

33:50.500 --> 33:52.333
In that field?

33:53.417 --> 33:55.041
'Tell us where.'

33:59.834 --> 34:03.875
It's too late...for him.

34:05.542 --> 34:07.583
For me.

34:09.041 --> 34:12.959
There's a point you
have to accept..

34:13.041 --> 34:15.375
...like Justin did..

34:17.333 --> 34:19.291
...that it's over.

34:23.333 --> 34:25.625
We know he buries
them where they ask.

34:25.709 --> 34:27.458
Someplace important to them.

34:27.542 --> 34:28.625
For Steve, it was where

34:28.709 --> 34:30.166
he hit his first home run.

34:30.250 --> 34:32.709
For Justin, the field he
rode horses with his mom.

34:32.792 --> 34:34.917
Same field where he
said music was playing.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.792
'Music, horses.'

34:36.875 --> 34:38.041
That's a weird combination.

34:38.125 --> 34:39.667
Whatever Justin
had in his locker

34:39.750 --> 34:40.792
had to be important to him.

34:40.875 --> 34:42.125
Significant somehow.

34:42.208 --> 34:44.959
There's nothing
here but junk.

34:45.041 --> 34:49.000
Tickets...like you'd
find at a fairground.

34:49.083 --> 34:50.583
So..

34:51.792 --> 34:55.542
Horses, music, fair, tickets.

34:57.291 --> 34:58.709
Merry-go-round.

34:58.792 --> 35:01.542
- How many are there in
Philly?
- 'I know a few.'

35:01.625 --> 35:03.625
- Veronica makes me take her.
- You remember where?

35:03.709 --> 35:06.125
Uh...Germantown

35:06.208 --> 35:09.250
'corner of Lombardy
and, uh, damn.'

35:09.333 --> 35:11.375
- Fourth Street.
- Need a unit at..

35:11.458 --> 35:13.458
Oh, there's another
one
down near the docks.

35:13.542 --> 35:16.583
The water can't bury him
there.
Um, what's the next one?

35:16.667 --> 35:18.000
There's 20
fairgrounds,
and counting.

35:18.083 --> 35:19.417
No, we got to narrow it down.

35:19.500 --> 35:21.083
How?

35:21.166 --> 35:24.166
He's gone through all the
stages of dying except one.

35:24.250 --> 35:27.208
He needs someone to be
there like he was there

35:27.291 --> 35:28.417
for Steve, for Justin.

35:28.500 --> 35:30.500
That's why he came in tonight.

35:30.583 --> 35:32.667
The last stage, acceptance.

35:34.542 --> 35:36.834
He needs to do
one more thing

35:36.917 --> 35:39.500
before he can accept.

35:45.542 --> 35:47.542
It finally stopped.

35:48.291 --> 35:50.750
The rain.

35:50.834 --> 35:52.667
Did it?

35:54.417 --> 35:57.542
You read about me in the papers.

35:57.625 --> 35:59.834
'You know I was almost shot.'

35:59.917 --> 36:01.250
Yes.

36:02.542 --> 36:04.542
Almost died.

36:04.625 --> 36:06.959
'But you didn't.'

36:07.041 --> 36:09.333
You killed him first.

36:11.875 --> 36:14.917
That's why I hate the rain.

36:17.083 --> 36:20.041
The quiet it brings.

36:20.125 --> 36:21.875
Why?

36:24.417 --> 36:27.792
Because that's what it
was like inside my head

36:27.875 --> 36:30.250
right before I
pulled the trigger.

36:32.291 --> 36:33.917
They say you

36:34.000 --> 36:36.875
see the moments of your life

36:36.959 --> 36:38.959
right before you die.

36:40.041 --> 36:41.625
No.

36:44.083 --> 36:46.166
Just one moment.

36:47.417 --> 36:49.083
Like Steve did.

36:50.291 --> 36:52.208
Justin.

36:54.208 --> 36:58.625
And, after I think you're
ready to say goodbye.

37:03.291 --> 37:06.750
Why are you here, John?

37:10.875 --> 37:12.875
I already told you.

37:15.166 --> 37:17.166
In this room

37:17.250 --> 37:19.959
people tell me all
sorts of things.

37:20.041 --> 37:21.667
You can, too.

37:21.750 --> 37:23.667
And I'll listen,
and not leave you

37:23.750 --> 37:27.041
like everyone else
has left you.

37:27.125 --> 37:28.208
'To die alone.'

37:28.291 --> 37:30.291
Like those boys died?

37:30.375 --> 37:32.834
How you must hate them..

37:32.917 --> 37:35.750
...Steve, Justin.

37:37.333 --> 37:39.583
So young.

37:39.667 --> 37:41.500
Their lives just starting.

37:41.583 --> 37:42.917
They get into
cars
with strangers

37:43.000 --> 37:44.583
and believe
they'll
live forever.

37:44.667 --> 37:47.834
- You think that's a crime?
- It is because they won't.

37:47.917 --> 37:49.500
They should know that

37:49.583 --> 37:51.875
and not be
disappointed
later.

37:51.959 --> 37:53.333
Like you once were.

37:53.417 --> 37:55.417
I've been dying for 26 years.

37:55.500 --> 37:57.208
I never believed.

37:57.291 --> 37:59.291
Didn't you?

38:00.750 --> 38:02.583
And I'd give anything

38:02.667 --> 38:06.166
to never have walked
into that attic.

38:06.250 --> 38:09.333
Never looked down
the barrel of his gun.

38:09.417 --> 38:11.959
So I could still believe

38:12.041 --> 38:14.000
that I'd live forever.

38:16.125 --> 38:18.500
Remember?

38:20.583 --> 38:22.792
No.

38:22.875 --> 38:25.125
It's the most beautiful
thing we'll ever do..

38:27.709 --> 38:30.000
...believing that.

38:30.083 --> 38:32.500
I don't remember.

38:32.583 --> 38:34.208
I do.

38:38.458 --> 38:41.291
Wintertime..

38:41.375 --> 38:44.417
...alone on the street..

38:44.500 --> 38:46.959
learning to ride my bike.

38:48.291 --> 38:50.542
It's almost dark.

38:51.750 --> 38:53.208
I remember..

38:53.291 --> 38:56.125
...the wind in my face

38:56.208 --> 38:58.417
and closing my eyes

38:58.500 --> 39:01.834
and suddenly I'm flying.

39:05.417 --> 39:06.875
You don't hate them
because they believe

39:06.959 --> 39:09.750
they'll live forever.

39:09.834 --> 39:12.417
You hate them

39:12.500 --> 39:14.625
because we once did too.

39:20.917 --> 39:22.667
Remember?

39:25.208 --> 39:28.250
Swimming in the river..

39:30.166 --> 39:32.667
...my friends..

39:34.667 --> 39:38.458
...dared me to
jump
from the bridge.

39:40.625 --> 39:42.959
It's a hundred foot fall.

39:44.083 --> 39:46.250
Did you?

39:46.333 --> 39:48.250
Did you jump?

39:51.041 --> 39:53.000
I was 17.

39:56.959 --> 39:58.750
Immortal.

40:01.208 --> 40:05.333
(in unison)
'Jump! Jump! Jump!'

40:05.417 --> 40:08.291
'Jump! Jump! Jump!'

40:09.125 --> 40:10.792
'Jump! Jump! Jump!'

40:10.875 --> 40:14.458
(in unison)
Jump! Jump! Jump!

40:14.542 --> 40:17.041
Jump! Jump! Jump!

41:10.333 --> 41:13.333
You believed when you jumped.

41:14.333 --> 41:16.583
So did Steve.

41:16.667 --> 41:18.375
And Justin.

41:19.375 --> 41:21.500
If only for a moment.

41:21.583 --> 41:24.750
You could have died
jumping off that bridge.

41:24.834 --> 41:27.000
But I lived.

41:29.125 --> 41:31.667
Let him live too.

44:15.458 --> 44:16.667
