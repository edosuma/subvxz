WEBVTT

00:01.258 --> 00:03.883
Your sheets are so soft.

00:04.022 --> 00:06.438
They've actually been in my
family for almost 40 years.

00:06.478 --> 00:07.181
Wow!

00:07.225 --> 00:09.553
If these old things could talk, huh?
Ew.

00:09.663 --> 00:11.171
I was just trying
to paint a picture.

00:11.238 --> 00:12.572
Read the room.

00:12.623 --> 00:14.457
Sheez.

00:16.076 --> 00:17.594
Hey, Julia.
Hey.

00:17.678 --> 00:20.130
It's so fun having
another girl around here.

00:20.214 --> 00:21.931
There are tampons hidden
all over the apartment.

00:23.634 --> 00:25.918
Ah! Damp towel! Damp!

00:25.970 --> 00:28.021
Here we go...
It's like a really big Wet-Nap.

00:28.088 --> 00:32.225
Ah. I feel like I'm being licked
by a golden retriever.

00:32.276 --> 00:33.893
Look at this bathroom.

00:33.944 --> 00:35.445
There should not be two girls
in this bathroom.

00:35.529 --> 00:38.097
You're too humid.
You make everything damp.

00:38.149 --> 00:39.949
80% of the products in here
are yours.

00:40.034 --> 00:41.868
Blah, blah, blah,
yawn, yes.

00:41.935 --> 00:43.736
I use sculpting chutney.

00:43.788 --> 00:46.772
Once I'm done with my chutney,
back in the row it goes.

00:46.824 --> 00:48.608
Hair everywhere...
Yo.

00:48.659 --> 00:50.610
The multicolored rubber bands.

00:50.661 --> 00:52.762
I'm fine with it.
It's all okay with me.

00:52.830 --> 00:54.898
But a damp towel
is where I draw the line.

00:54.965 --> 00:57.300
Sorry, so what are your
thoughts on damp towels?

00:57.384 --> 00:59.369
Oh, you'd better watch it,
Nick's Overnight Guest.

00:59.436 --> 01:00.904
Julia.
I know your name.

01:02.840 --> 01:05.373
Are you flexing, right now?
No.

01:05.467 --> 01:06.264
Hey.
Hey.

01:06.311 --> 01:07.177
So, I'm gonna just get ready
in your room.

01:07.261 --> 01:09.212
Sure. Feeling a little weird
and uncomfortable in here?

01:09.280 --> 01:11.181
Hey, Julia,
I'll see you later tonight.

01:11.248 --> 01:12.782
Yeah. See you later.

01:12.850 --> 01:14.901
She's helping me get out
of a traffic ticket.

01:14.968 --> 01:16.853
Jess, are you seriously using
the girl I'm sleeping with

01:16.937 --> 01:18.588
for free legal advice?

01:18.656 --> 01:20.973
Oh, I'm sorry,
the girl you're sleeping with?

01:21.025 --> 01:22.759
I mean, you can't
call her your girlfriend?

01:22.827 --> 01:25.662
We're not labeling it.
Oh, you're not labeling it,

01:25.729 --> 01:27.280
'cause you're too sophisticated.

01:27.331 --> 01:28.765
Don't do your
"sophisticated guy."

01:28.833 --> 01:30.667
That's now how
a sophisticated man dances.

01:30.734 --> 01:31.768
How does
a sophisticated man dance?

01:31.836 --> 01:34.637
♪ I'm too sophisticated

01:34.705 --> 01:37.924
♪ I don't believe
in labeling. ♪

01:37.991 --> 01:40.030
You gotta get laid, man.
You gotta get laid, man.

01:40.078 --> 01:40.968
Yeah, I need to get laid.

01:40.984 --> 01:43.112
This is bad.
Get out of here.

01:43.180 --> 01:45.465

01:49.921 --> 01:51.856
You know,
maybe I should call Shelby.

01:51.923 --> 01:53.433
I haven't seen her since
I got back from Latvia.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.091
We did have an amazing time
together.

01:55.159 --> 01:58.228
Whoo! That was amazing.

01:58.295 --> 02:01.281
Yeah.
All right, bye.

02:01.348 --> 02:02.632
I'm gonna call her.

02:02.716 --> 02:05.585
Yeah, over in Latvia

02:05.636 --> 02:08.020
they had this fermented milk
stuff that they drink.

02:08.088 --> 02:11.357
Whole country runs on the stuff.
Called.

02:12.922 --> 02:14.608
was definitely
one of my biggest endorsements.

02:14.656 --> 02:15.852
I mean, I have a lot
of endorsements,

02:15.867 --> 02:17.514
but that was probably
my biggest endorsement

02:17.581 --> 02:19.100
amongst other endorsements
that I had.

02:19.124 --> 02:19.975
Wow.

02:20.017 --> 02:22.252
So, um... your place or mine?

02:25.156 --> 02:27.440
What are we laughing at?

02:27.491 --> 02:30.059
How much I'm not going
home with you tonight.

02:32.296 --> 02:35.748
You show up after two
years, out of the blue,

02:35.800 --> 02:37.700
and all you do is
talk about yourself.

02:37.768 --> 02:40.136
You don't even let me
get a word in edgewise.

02:40.204 --> 02:42.705
Why did you agree to let me
take you out for drinks?

02:42.773 --> 02:45.124
Winston, you took me
out for a drink

02:45.192 --> 02:47.460
at the place where I work!

02:47.511 --> 02:49.462
Here's your bill.

02:49.513 --> 02:51.764
Thanks for the water.

02:53.800 --> 02:56.469
Man, I told you to get yourself
whatever you wanted.

02:56.520 --> 02:58.988
You chose water.

02:59.056 --> 03:00.690
<i>Have a seat.</i>

03:00.774 --> 03:02.075
Okay.

03:02.142 --> 03:04.494
Let me get you a blanket.

03:04.578 --> 03:06.812
Why would I want
a blanket right now?

03:06.864 --> 03:09.032
Just to get toasty.
Oh.

03:11.652 --> 03:14.170
Would you like a cookie,
or a cupcake? I made them.

03:14.255 --> 03:16.506
Oh, no. I'm okay.
I'm not really a dessert person.

03:16.590 --> 03:18.875
I just don't eat it, usually.
Okay. Okay.

03:18.959 --> 03:21.377
I'm just gonna put this,

03:21.462 --> 03:23.129
like, right here.

03:23.180 --> 03:25.265
I don't... okay.
Just...

03:25.332 --> 03:26.599
Why don't you
just take me through

03:26.667 --> 03:27.884
what happened
with the ticket?

03:27.968 --> 03:29.135
Okay.
They got a photo of you?

03:29.186 --> 03:30.603
♪ At the scene of the crime

03:30.671 --> 03:31.804
♪ Meh, meh, meh, meh.

03:32.857 --> 03:35.174
Is this it?

03:35.226 --> 03:37.310
Yeah.
Okay.

03:37.361 --> 03:40.813
Hmm. This may actually be
kind of hard to argue with.

03:40.865 --> 03:43.015
Well, there's actually more
there than meets the eye.

03:43.067 --> 03:44.183
Um, there was a bird--
he's not in the shot--

03:44.235 --> 03:46.286
but he was injured,

03:46.353 --> 03:49.072
and he couldn't get out of the
road, and so I braked, and then

03:49.156 --> 03:50.657
I had to accelerate
out of the intersection.

03:50.708 --> 03:52.458
You missed your first
court date on this.

03:52.526 --> 03:54.627
My ex-boyfriend failed
to send it to me

03:54.695 --> 03:56.362
before the court date,

03:56.413 --> 03:57.914
because he doesn't
believe in mail,

03:57.998 --> 03:59.883
which has to do with his
thoughts on government spending.

03:59.967 --> 04:01.834
Now it's an $800 fine.

04:01.886 --> 04:04.420
That's why I need, like, a
really awesome lawyer, like you.

04:04.505 --> 04:07.307
So... can you help me?

04:07.374 --> 04:09.759
I mean, I can try.
You never know.

04:09.843 --> 04:12.011
A judge might buy into
this whole thing, so...

04:12.062 --> 04:14.430
What "whole thing"?

04:14.515 --> 04:15.982
Your whole thing.

04:16.048 --> 04:19.067
With the cupcakes,
and the braking for birds,

04:19.153 --> 04:22.021
and... bluebirds come and
help me dress in the morning.

04:22.072 --> 04:23.823
Oh, I didn't know
I was doing a thing.

04:23.890 --> 04:26.326
It's a great thing.
I mean, the big,

04:26.393 --> 04:28.745
beautiful eyes,
like a scared baby.

04:28.829 --> 04:31.030
I'm sure that gets you
out of all kinds of stuff.

04:31.081 --> 04:35.702
Yeah. Yeah, except my peripheral
vision's, like, almost too good.

04:38.539 --> 04:40.506
Hey, so...

04:40.574 --> 04:42.408
living here,
it's probably fun, right?

04:42.459 --> 04:44.043
Yeah.
There are, like, lots of girls

04:44.094 --> 04:45.511
coming in and out
of this place?

04:45.579 --> 04:48.247
Schmidt's like Ellis
Island in the 1800s.

04:48.299 --> 04:49.515
He accepts everyone.

04:49.583 --> 04:52.552
Yeah, and...
Winston and Nick...

04:52.603 --> 04:55.271
I probably shouldn't...

04:55.356 --> 04:57.690
Oh, yeah. Well, you don't have to...
Plead the Fifth!

04:57.758 --> 04:59.892
No, that's not what...
Objection!

04:59.944 --> 05:02.278
Nick, hey!
Hey, Julia!

05:02.363 --> 05:03.479
You want to hang out
in your room?
Sure.

05:03.564 --> 05:05.264
Jess, if you'll excuse us,

05:05.316 --> 05:07.400
Julie's about to be
very disappointed.

05:07.451 --> 05:09.902
Okay, so I will look at
this stuff some more,

05:09.954 --> 05:12.121
I-I'll call some people,
see what I can do.

05:12.206 --> 05:13.906
Here's your blankie back.

05:17.578 --> 05:19.495
Power blazer. Hey.
Ha ha.

05:21.498 --> 05:22.999
What's going on with the ticket?

05:25.786 --> 05:27.387
She has a problem
with me, Nick.

05:27.454 --> 05:29.756
Okay? She doesn't like me.
What are you talking about?

05:29.807 --> 05:31.224
You don't understand,
'cause you're a guy.

05:31.291 --> 05:33.726
She does not have a problem
with you. She's just...

05:33.794 --> 05:36.179
Nick, your girlfriend's
not a dessert person.

05:37.798 --> 05:40.066
Hmm.

05:43.187 --> 05:45.799
She said you have
"a whole thing"?

05:45.865 --> 05:47.299
I'm sorry,
she doesn't like desserts?

05:47.368 --> 05:48.868
Where is she
right now?

05:48.936 --> 05:50.970
Look, I think
I know what she meant.

05:51.038 --> 05:52.572
I mean, you do like girly stuff.

05:52.640 --> 05:55.008
I mean, it kind of
freaked me out at first.

05:55.075 --> 05:58.011
When I met you, you were
wearing a hat made of ribbons.

05:58.078 --> 06:00.447
My ribbon hat.
I love that hat.

06:00.514 --> 06:02.715
Screw her. And I'm gonna
wear that ribbon hat.

06:02.783 --> 06:03.950
Go get it, right now.

06:04.018 --> 06:05.652
Be right back.

06:05.719 --> 06:07.720
Whoa. There she is.

06:07.788 --> 06:09.589
Nick, where is this bitch?

06:09.657 --> 06:11.958
Gonna smack that lawyer learning
right out of her mouth.

06:12.026 --> 06:13.326
Okay, this is getting excessive,
guys.

06:13.394 --> 06:15.395
She's actually helping her
get out of a ticket.

06:15.463 --> 06:18.031
By being condescending
and judgmental?

06:18.098 --> 06:19.365
What did she say?

06:19.433 --> 06:21.835
Ugh, just drop it, Nick.

06:21.902 --> 06:23.636
Okay, what did Julia do wrong?

06:23.704 --> 06:25.071
It's just how girls
fight sometimes.

06:25.139 --> 06:26.439
There's a lot unsaid.

06:26.507 --> 06:27.774
Like one time,
a girl said to me,

06:27.842 --> 06:29.075
"Jess, you rock a
lot of polka dots."

06:29.143 --> 06:30.743
Ooh. How did she say it?

06:30.811 --> 06:32.846
"Jess, you rock
a lot of polka dots."

06:32.913 --> 06:34.948
That is diabolical.
I'm really sorry.

06:35.015 --> 06:36.282
And it ruined
our friendship.

06:36.350 --> 06:38.318
I mean, I couldn't get over
the polka dot incident.

06:38.385 --> 06:39.619
Warning! Spoiler alert.

06:39.687 --> 06:41.154
Somebody unplugged
my dehumidifier

06:41.222 --> 06:42.789
to plug in
their flatiron.

06:42.857 --> 06:45.358
I will be putting my
dehumidifier, and my towel,

06:45.426 --> 06:48.094
in my room,
where nothing ever gets wet.

06:48.162 --> 06:50.797
All right, you know what, Jess?
Julia's one of those girls

06:50.865 --> 06:52.866
where she doesn't have,
like, a lot of girl friends.

06:52.933 --> 06:55.668
Because she thinks like a guy.
She doesn't play mind games.

06:55.736 --> 06:57.804
So blind!
Look, all I know

06:57.872 --> 06:59.606
is she's totally
up front with me.

06:59.673 --> 07:01.875
No subtext, no codes.

07:01.942 --> 07:04.177
Oh. Okay. So did she
come right out and ask you

07:04.245 --> 07:05.578
if you were seeing other girls?

07:05.646 --> 07:07.447
Because... she asked me.

07:10.551 --> 07:13.520
She did?
You didn't know that?

07:13.587 --> 07:16.122
'Cause I thought you guys were
so up front with one another.

07:16.190 --> 07:18.391
I thought you guys told
each other everything. Yeah.

07:18.459 --> 07:20.793
She told him she didn't
want to label it.

07:20.861 --> 07:21.794
Oh. I mean,
that's a classic move,

07:21.862 --> 07:23.530
even in the lesbian community.

07:29.303 --> 07:30.904
What are we talking about?

07:30.971 --> 07:32.539
Did you just hear the phrase
"lesbian community"

07:32.606 --> 07:33.773
and come running
out of your room?

07:33.841 --> 07:35.608
I did. Uh...

07:35.676 --> 07:36.843
question, for you.

07:36.911 --> 07:38.811
This community you speak of,

07:38.879 --> 07:40.847
do the ladies look, uh...

07:40.915 --> 07:44.317
more like this one
or, you know...

07:44.385 --> 07:46.553
kind of Nickish?
Aw, shut up, Schmidt.

07:46.620 --> 07:48.521
I did date a woman
who looked a lot like Nick.

07:48.589 --> 07:50.890
You did. Felicia.

07:52.760 --> 07:54.360
Why can't you just admit
that she's your girlfriend?

07:54.428 --> 07:56.129
I know, I just thought

07:56.196 --> 07:58.398
it was uncomplicated,
and now I'm freaking out.

07:58.465 --> 08:00.199
I'm not good at
being a boyfriend.

08:00.267 --> 08:02.101
I'm good at being that guy
that you find yourself

08:02.169 --> 08:03.436
spending more and more time with

08:03.504 --> 08:05.071
until you meet your husband.

08:05.139 --> 08:08.308
All right. So, so far,
Nick Miller's list of fears is

08:08.375 --> 08:12.111
sharks, tap water,
real relationships.

08:12.179 --> 08:13.479
And blueberries.
Barkeep.

08:13.547 --> 08:15.014
Get this man a drink.

08:15.082 --> 08:17.517
Ladies, he hasn't had sex
in four months.

08:17.585 --> 08:18.751
Come and get it, ladies.

08:18.819 --> 08:20.763
I seriously hate you, Schmidt.
Why?

08:20.803 --> 08:21.990
It didn't go well with Shelby?

08:22.044 --> 08:23.790
I gotta say, I thought
it would be easy.

08:23.857 --> 08:25.525
You know? Maybe...

08:25.593 --> 08:27.694
maybe I don't have game.
Maybe I never had game.

08:27.761 --> 08:29.462
Maybe it's always
been about basketball.

08:29.530 --> 08:31.130
Yeah, you don't have any game.

08:31.198 --> 08:32.732
It's always been because
you play basketball.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.433
Are you seriously just realizing
that you don't have game?

08:34.501 --> 08:36.769
What is your secret, man?
How do normal guys get girls?

08:36.837 --> 08:39.672
Let's not say "normal."
Just, you know, say
what it is-- "average."

08:39.740 --> 08:41.441
You've had the most game,
out of any of us.

08:41.508 --> 08:42.909
Because for years now,

08:42.977 --> 08:44.811
you've been working
with absolutely nothing.

08:44.878 --> 08:46.012
He makes a good point.
Okay.

08:46.080 --> 08:47.847
I've been working with nothing.
Zilch.

08:47.915 --> 08:49.015
You're right,
I've got nothing.

08:49.083 --> 08:51.284
Except this.

08:54.455 --> 08:57.090
Ow.

08:57.157 --> 08:58.524
Oh, my God.

08:58.592 --> 09:00.326
Miller! No <i>Cocktail!</i>

09:00.394 --> 09:01.594
Sorry, Julio.

09:01.662 --> 09:04.430
Julia! Hey, Julia!

09:04.498 --> 09:05.665
Hey.

09:05.733 --> 09:07.066
Ooh. You guys are using names?

09:07.134 --> 09:10.036
That's not too labelly for you?

09:10.104 --> 09:11.871
Hey.
Hey, hey, Jules.

09:11.939 --> 09:13.139
Hey.

09:13.207 --> 09:15.141
Thought I'd drop by
and say hello.

09:15.209 --> 09:17.010
Oh, I didn't know
we were doing drop-bys.

09:17.077 --> 09:18.578
Uh...

09:18.646 --> 09:20.847
Here's a scenario
that's paid sexual dividends,

09:20.914 --> 09:22.482
particularly
in the Asian markets,

09:22.549 --> 09:25.451
and I think, Jess,
you can back me up on this.

09:25.519 --> 09:27.053
Inform her that
you're an aerialist

09:27.121 --> 09:28.388
for the Cirque du Soleil.

09:28.455 --> 09:30.023
Winston, just ask questions,

09:30.090 --> 09:31.724
pay attention to her,
listen to her,

09:31.792 --> 09:33.493
don't listen to him.

09:33.560 --> 09:35.495
Oh, believe me, I don't
take advice from Schmidt.

09:35.562 --> 09:37.296
Never have, never
will. Ever.

09:37.364 --> 09:39.399
So Jess told me what

09:39.466 --> 09:42.502
you asked her yesterday.
What?

09:42.569 --> 09:44.804
That you asked if I was
sleeping with other people.

09:44.872 --> 09:48.508
That is not even...
I... what?

09:48.575 --> 09:51.077
I don't want to play games.
That's not what happened, okay?

09:51.145 --> 09:53.446
I just said something to h,
because I was feeling

09:53.514 --> 09:54.814
kind of guilty,
because I'm, uh....

09:54.882 --> 09:56.916
I'm dating other people,
and I just, you know...

09:56.984 --> 09:59.552
wanted to see if you were also
dating other people.

09:59.620 --> 10:00.653
You're dating other people?
Yeah, yeah.

10:02.623 --> 10:04.624
No. No, I'm seeing
other people, too.

10:04.692 --> 10:07.293
Good. Good.

10:07.361 --> 10:09.328
I'm having sex all the time.
I'm like a mailman.

10:09.396 --> 10:12.432
Except instead of mail,
it's hot sex that I deliver.

10:12.499 --> 10:14.300
I've had to start carrying,
like,

10:14.368 --> 10:16.169
athletic shoes in my purse,

10:16.236 --> 10:19.372
'cause I have to sprint from
one sexual encounter to another.

10:19.440 --> 10:20.606
Can't wear heels.

10:20.674 --> 10:22.909
Well, I'm having sex right now.

10:22.976 --> 10:24.310
Under the bar.

10:24.378 --> 10:25.745
And she's on top.

10:25.813 --> 10:27.180
So figure that out.

10:28.916 --> 10:31.017
Was that her?
Yeah.

10:31.085 --> 10:32.218
Well, great.
Great.

10:32.286 --> 10:33.419
Then we're both doing
the exact same thing.

10:33.487 --> 10:34.954
And we're on the same page.

10:35.022 --> 10:36.422
Kudos for not putting
labels on things.

10:36.490 --> 10:38.224
That is exactly what I want.
It's my dream.

10:38.292 --> 10:39.792
Just going to go to
the bathroom really quickly.

10:39.860 --> 10:41.594
Okay. Great.

10:43.000 --> 10:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:51.171 --> 10:53.106
Hey. Julia?

10:53.173 --> 10:54.607
Are you serious?

10:54.675 --> 10:56.275
Did Nick say some
stuff to you?

10:56.343 --> 10:57.977
Because I'm really sorry,
and I want to explain...

10:58.045 --> 10:59.579
Why would you tell him
that I said that?

10:59.646 --> 11:01.214
Do you know what that
makes me look like?

11:01.281 --> 11:02.715
Um...

11:02.783 --> 11:03.950
I see what you're doing.

11:04.017 --> 11:05.284
I know that I'm

11:05.352 --> 11:06.586
the mean lawyer girl

11:06.653 --> 11:08.955
who wears suits
and works too much

11:09.022 --> 11:11.891
and you... you're
the really fun teacher girl

11:11.959 --> 11:15.528
with all the colorful skirts
and you bake things.

11:15.596 --> 11:17.597
And eventually, Nick
is going to come running to you

11:17.664 --> 11:19.932
and you'll tuck him in
under his blankie and...

11:20.000 --> 11:21.634
What is it with you
and the blankie thing?

11:21.702 --> 11:23.736
I never said the
word blankie.

11:23.804 --> 11:25.738
I don't talk like
Teddy Ruxpin.

11:25.806 --> 11:28.374
If I acted the way that you act
when I was at work,

11:28.442 --> 11:29.742
nobody would listen to me.

11:29.810 --> 11:31.544
Well, if I acted
like you at work,

11:31.612 --> 11:33.079
my students would turn in

11:33.147 --> 11:34.881
really weird,
dark dioramas, so...

11:34.948 --> 11:37.183
I don't like you.

11:37.251 --> 11:39.952
And I don't want
to be your friend, so...

11:40.020 --> 11:41.554
Fine.
Can you leave, please?

11:41.622 --> 11:43.756
Because...

11:43.824 --> 11:46.392
I am about to start crying,

11:46.460 --> 11:47.660
and you are
the last person

11:47.728 --> 11:50.196
that I want to cry in front of.

11:50.264 --> 11:52.465
I want to cry, t, and...

11:52.533 --> 11:54.133
where am I
supposed to cry?

11:54.201 --> 11:56.803
You can't monopolize
the bathroom crying space.

11:56.870 --> 11:58.104
Please go.

12:04.578 --> 12:06.646
What are you doing, Jess?

12:06.713 --> 12:08.414
Get out!
I'm sorry.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.979
Winston, what are you doing?
Ba, ba, ba, ba,

12:20.030 --> 12:21.330
ba, ba.

12:21.415 --> 12:23.699
I have come here
to listen to you.

12:23.784 --> 12:25.334
Should I have interrupted you
to tell you that?

12:25.419 --> 12:27.119
Probably not.

12:27.171 --> 12:28.654
So how...
how are you?

12:28.705 --> 12:31.123
Tell me about your life,
and how is everything?

12:31.175 --> 12:33.593
Winston, what am I
supposed to do?

12:33.660 --> 12:36.128
I was a booty call
for two years,

12:36.180 --> 12:38.214
and then I was
nothing for two years.

12:38.298 --> 12:40.683
You show up bragging
after all this time

12:40.767 --> 12:41.934
like nothing has changed.

12:42.002 --> 12:43.469
What do you want me to think?

12:44.671 --> 12:46.005
That I'm an idiot.

12:46.056 --> 12:47.890
And you know what?

12:47.975 --> 12:50.176
You're right,
and I'm sorry.

12:50.244 --> 12:52.979
It's just that since I've
stopped playing ball,

12:53.030 --> 12:55.615
I realize I'm not
that good at this.

12:55.682 --> 12:57.733
And, quite frankly,
you are way out of my league.

12:57.818 --> 12:59.485
That is clear now.

12:59.536 --> 13:03.706
But... I do hope this is not
the last time I see you,

13:03.790 --> 13:06.742
but whatever you want,
I'm cool with.

13:06.827 --> 13:09.045
I got to get back to work.

13:09.129 --> 13:10.529
Yeah.

13:10.581 --> 13:13.365
Yeah, I'll help you.

13:13.417 --> 13:15.001
See?

13:15.052 --> 13:16.969
I'm the manager.

13:17.037 --> 13:18.304
Oh, you're the manager?
Yeah.

13:18.371 --> 13:21.340
Wow, that's amazing.
It's okay.

13:21.391 --> 13:22.758
Case 73.

13:22.843 --> 13:24.343
Mr. Sandoval.

13:26.013 --> 13:28.481
I see you have dressed
for the occasion.

13:28.548 --> 13:29.849
Oh. Hi.

13:29.900 --> 13:31.100
You didn't
have to come.

13:31.184 --> 13:32.485
I'm sure you're
very busy.

13:32.552 --> 13:34.020
I said that I
would be here,

13:34.071 --> 13:35.438
so I'm here.
Don't worry.

13:35.522 --> 13:37.056
I think I can handle it.
Let's just

13:37.107 --> 13:39.191
get this over with
so we can get out of here.

13:42.946 --> 13:44.714
Your Honor.

13:46.900 --> 13:48.868
Your Honor.

13:48.919 --> 13:50.402
Your Honor.

13:50.454 --> 13:52.071
These are the facts, Your Honor.

13:52.089 --> 13:53.756
♪ Your Honor.

13:53.840 --> 13:57.460
Case 74-- Jessica Day.

13:57.536 --> 14:00.174
Yes, sir. Yes, I'm present, sir.
Okay, listen.

14:00.236 --> 14:01.885
You just have to enter
the plea yourself,

14:01.947 --> 14:03.135
all right, and then
I'll do the rest.

14:03.182 --> 14:04.494
Okay, okay. I got
it, all right?

14:04.573 --> 14:06.612
So you know, all you have to do is say...
I got it! Thank you.

14:06.705 --> 14:07.887
Okay. Okay.
How do you plead?

14:07.932 --> 14:08.753
Guilty.
What?

14:08.784 --> 14:10.406
Great. Pay your fine upstairs.

14:11.692 --> 14:14.672
Well, I guess
we're never going to know

14:14.764 --> 14:16.014
if the bird defense works.

14:16.068 --> 14:17.568
Such a bummer, too.

14:17.612 --> 14:19.163
We have this pool
at my office.

14:19.224 --> 14:20.357
Okay. Hey!

14:21.318 --> 14:23.452
I got something to
say to you, man.

14:23.537 --> 14:24.770
What?

14:24.821 --> 14:26.572
I brake for birds.

14:26.623 --> 14:28.708
I rock a lot
of polka dots.

14:28.775 --> 14:31.744
I have touched glitter
in the last 24 hours.

14:31.795 --> 14:34.914
I spend my entire day
talking to children.

14:34.965 --> 14:38.250
And I find it
fundamentally strange

14:38.302 --> 14:40.052
that you're not a
dessert person.

14:40.120 --> 14:42.421
That's just weird,
and it freaks me out.

14:42.472 --> 14:44.340
And I'm sorry I don't
talk like Murphy Brown.

14:44.424 --> 14:46.092
And I hate your pantsuit.

14:46.176 --> 14:48.427
I wish it had ribbons
on it or something

14:48.478 --> 14:49.979
to make it just slightly cuter.

14:50.063 --> 14:52.297
And that doesn't
mean I'm not smart

14:52.349 --> 14:54.466
and tough and strong.

14:54.518 --> 14:55.968
Okay.

14:56.019 --> 14:57.403
And I know you
like Nick,

14:57.470 --> 14:59.438
and I'm not trying
to interfere,

14:59.489 --> 15:01.941
but you should just
talk to him about it.

15:01.992 --> 15:03.642
Are you done?

15:03.694 --> 15:05.194
I am almost done.

15:05.278 --> 15:09.365
I'm about to go and
pay this $800 fine,

15:09.449 --> 15:13.536
and my checks have baby
farm animals on them, bitch.

15:14.988 --> 15:16.706
That's
the wrong way.

15:25.621 --> 15:26.638
You moved.

15:26.722 --> 15:27.972
You remember
my old place?

15:28.057 --> 15:29.641
The place in the hood?

15:29.725 --> 15:30.925
No.

15:30.976 --> 15:32.944
It was hood-adjacent.
Whatever.

15:34.780 --> 15:37.699
So, um...
so this was nice.

15:37.766 --> 15:39.267
Yeah, it was.

15:40.820 --> 15:42.620
You want to know
what I want to do now?

15:42.705 --> 15:44.105
What?

15:44.156 --> 15:46.241
Take you on
a real date.

15:47.743 --> 15:49.610
Why don't you call me?

15:50.779 --> 15:52.747
Good night, Winston.

16:01.841 --> 16:03.341
Winston, what's happening?
Huh?

16:03.426 --> 16:04.676
Yeah, good night.

16:04.760 --> 16:06.127
What is wrong with you, man?

16:06.178 --> 16:08.012
You got no game.
That was so stupid.

16:13.302 --> 16:16.070
Hey! Anyone!

16:16.138 --> 16:17.906
My towel!

16:17.973 --> 16:20.108
Can someone please get my towel?

16:20.159 --> 16:23.027
It's in my room
next to my Irish walking cape.

16:23.112 --> 16:24.746
The... the bigger towel.

16:24.813 --> 16:27.332
Not... do not touch
the small one.

16:27.416 --> 16:29.083
Okay, I left my
towel in my room.

16:29.151 --> 16:31.286
Nobody look.

16:31.337 --> 16:32.487
Nobody look, yo.

16:32.538 --> 16:34.289
We don't want to.
Nobody look.

16:34.340 --> 16:36.007
Seriously, no...
no one's looking?

16:36.091 --> 16:38.510
All right, forget it.

16:38.594 --> 16:41.513
Aah! Damn it!
See, he's a natural blond.

16:41.597 --> 16:44.365
What shape is that supposed
to be shaved into?

16:44.433 --> 16:46.518
Think he's trying to
force perspective.

16:46.602 --> 16:48.669
Very funny. I got
to get something off my chest.

16:48.721 --> 16:51.172
No, Schmidt, there is an apron

16:51.223 --> 16:53.274
right over there--
go cover yourself.

16:53.342 --> 16:55.477
You are Jewish.
You're making me gayer.

16:55.528 --> 16:57.612
Are you going to go on,
like, a big wet towel rant?

16:57.679 --> 16:59.197
No. This is now a sex rant.

16:59.281 --> 17:00.515
To wit,

17:00.566 --> 17:02.183
six months ago,
I thought

17:02.234 --> 17:04.435
getting a girl roommate
would mean sex all the time--

17:04.502 --> 17:07.405
definitely with her friends
and probably with her.

17:07.490 --> 17:08.656
Are there women here?

17:08.707 --> 17:10.074
Yeah, sure, more than ever.

17:10.159 --> 17:12.493
But you-- not going to happen.

17:12.545 --> 17:14.662
You, I will never give up.

17:14.713 --> 17:17.080
And you... well, you sample
from the gumbo pot.

17:17.165 --> 17:19.032
I am in a
damp bathroom

17:19.084 --> 17:22.837
full of naked women every day,
and I hate it.

17:22.905 --> 17:25.205
It's like a nightmare.
I'm in a...

17:25.257 --> 17:28.226
watermelon-themed apron
with a...

17:29.812 --> 17:31.379
A tampon?

17:31.430 --> 17:34.382
Why would you need this
for cooking?

17:34.433 --> 17:36.284
I just had an idea.

17:36.352 --> 17:38.436
Why don't we hang our
towels on towel bars

17:38.521 --> 17:40.238
instead of hooks, and
that'll make them dryer?

17:40.322 --> 17:42.056
That is the...

17:42.107 --> 17:45.827
that is... that is a great idea.

17:46.996 --> 17:48.196
Quick question for you.

17:48.247 --> 17:51.282
As a lesbian gynecologist,

17:51.367 --> 17:54.168
perhaps, one of these days,
the two of us

17:54.236 --> 17:56.371
could sit down
and talk about OSI.

17:56.422 --> 17:58.590
What is OSI?
Our shared interest.

17:58.674 --> 18:00.542
Schmidt, clothe yourself!
All right, all right.

18:00.593 --> 18:01.793
It was just a suggestion.

18:04.547 --> 18:06.180
Oh.

18:06.248 --> 18:08.216
Hey.
Hi.

18:08.267 --> 18:09.884
Nick's not here.

18:09.935 --> 18:11.269
That's okay.

18:11.353 --> 18:14.305
Uh, because I came here to...

18:14.390 --> 18:15.940
well, I kind of came

18:16.025 --> 18:19.110
because I-I thought
it would be good if you and I...

18:19.194 --> 18:20.862
Hey, Jess, my hands
are actually stuck

18:20.929 --> 18:22.614
in the yarn because...
Oh.

18:22.698 --> 18:24.949
I didn't realize that you
had people over. Sorry.

18:25.034 --> 18:28.202
No, it's just... crochet time.

18:28.270 --> 18:29.988
Yeah.

18:30.072 --> 18:31.489
Nick's not here right now.
No, I know.

18:31.574 --> 18:33.658
Thanks.

18:33.742 --> 18:36.377
I'll just come back later.

18:36.445 --> 18:37.295
Hey, Julia.

18:38.581 --> 18:39.714
Do you want to crochet with us?

18:43.586 --> 18:45.787
I mean,
growing up was brutal.

18:45.854 --> 18:47.839
I went to
an all-girls school.

18:47.923 --> 18:49.957
The worst-- girls can be
so mean to each other.

18:50.009 --> 18:52.477
Yeah, Cece and I hid
in the bathroom for four years.

18:52.561 --> 18:53.978
This is... this is
really nice, guys.

18:54.063 --> 18:55.463
Thank you for
letting me join in.

18:55.514 --> 18:56.848
It's totally
relaxing.

18:56.932 --> 18:58.799
Except that I don't know why,

18:58.851 --> 19:01.102
if I put the fox
through the cave,

19:01.153 --> 19:02.470
it doesn't...
the yarn is broken.

19:02.521 --> 19:03.738
I don't know

19:03.805 --> 19:06.357
why this is not turning into...

19:06.442 --> 19:08.192
What you making?

19:08.277 --> 19:09.861
A hat.

19:09.945 --> 19:12.246
If you're making a hat
for a baby, it is done.

19:12.314 --> 19:14.148
Yeah.

19:16.251 --> 19:17.952
Hey, Julia.

19:18.003 --> 19:19.420
What are you doing here?

19:19.488 --> 19:21.289
Could I talk to
you for a second?

19:21.340 --> 19:22.657
Okay.

19:24.043 --> 19:25.460
Hey, Julia.

19:25.511 --> 19:27.211
Stop.

19:27.296 --> 19:29.597
No, there's something
that I need to say to you.

19:29.665 --> 19:30.598
All right. Then go ahead.

19:31.850 --> 19:32.967
Okay.
Okay.

19:33.018 --> 19:34.835
I'm going to say it.

19:34.887 --> 19:37.188
Okay, I...
Just say it.

19:37.272 --> 19:39.390
All right. I-I wanted
to say that...

19:39.475 --> 19:41.359
I don't want to date
anybody else.

19:41.443 --> 19:43.611
I just want to date you.

19:47.032 --> 19:48.700
Well, that's what I
was going to say to you.

19:50.018 --> 19:51.319
Really?
Yeah.

19:52.955 --> 19:56.040
So, then... so, then,
what does that mean?

19:56.125 --> 19:58.876
You're, like,
my boyfriend now?

19:58.961 --> 20:00.962
I'm not really into labels.

20:01.029 --> 20:01.963
Yeah, all right.

20:09.338 --> 20:10.505
Boyfriend.

20:10.556 --> 20:12.557
That's so lame.

20:12.641 --> 20:14.726
You're totally going to...

20:14.810 --> 20:16.928
carry my books home
from school.

20:17.012 --> 20:19.213
I will if you wear
my leatherman jacket.

20:19.264 --> 20:20.898
It's "letterman" jacket.
No, I'm pretty sure

20:20.983 --> 20:22.883
it's a leatherman jacket.
You letter...

20:22.935 --> 20:24.318
The leather sleeves
that the football guys wear?

20:24.386 --> 20:26.738
I'm right. I'm right.

20:28.824 --> 20:30.091
I'm glad you
pitched a fit,

20:30.159 --> 20:31.909
because my towel
is very dry.

20:31.994 --> 20:34.195
I didn't pitch a fit.
I just...

20:34.246 --> 20:35.747
Damp!

20:35.831 --> 20:37.281
Damn it!

20:37.366 --> 20:38.916
Everybody-- bathroom now!

20:39.001 --> 20:41.085
What's up, Dad?

20:41.170 --> 20:42.670
What, Schmidt?
Is someone playing

20:42.738 --> 20:44.122
a joke on me?

20:44.206 --> 20:45.873
Honestly,
why is my towel still damp?

20:45.924 --> 20:48.710
cause it's not your towel;
it's my towel, Schmidt.

20:48.761 --> 20:50.545
No, it's not your towel.
Your towel is the red one.

20:50.596 --> 20:51.679
I'll tell you
this, pal.

20:51.747 --> 20:53.097
I've never used that.

20:53.182 --> 20:54.282
I do use that one
every single day.

20:55.718 --> 20:56.917
Oh, God.

20:56.969 --> 20:59.086
This towel's
so warm and fluffy.

20:59.138 --> 21:01.139
It's like it's been
in the sun forever.

21:01.223 --> 21:02.774
This means you two
have been drying your junk

21:02.858 --> 21:04.776
with the same towel.
Intimate.

21:04.860 --> 21:06.560
Are you out of your mind?!
What do you mean, am I...

21:06.612 --> 21:08.496
How do you think this is
your towel? Do you even wash it?

21:08.563 --> 21:10.748
No, I don't wash the towel;
the towel washes me.

21:10.833 --> 21:12.733
Who washes a towel?

21:12.785 --> 21:14.452
You never wash...?
You wash your towel?

21:14.536 --> 21:17.088
You never wash the towel?
What am I going to do?

21:17.172 --> 21:19.791
Wash the shower next?
Wash a bar of soap?

21:19.875 --> 21:22.427
You got to think here, pal.
I'm furious right now.

21:22.511 --> 21:24.796
I get out of the damn shower,
I'm clean as a damn baby,

21:24.880 --> 21:26.581
and I use the towel.
Let me ask you this.

21:26.648 --> 21:28.749
Have you been wearing
my underpants?

21:28.801 --> 21:30.417
Sometimes, yeah. Who cares?

21:30.469 --> 21:32.804
You guys don't wear
each other's underpants?

21:32.888 --> 21:35.885
You're lying. We all wear
each other's underwear.
