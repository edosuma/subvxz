00:01.627 --> 00:05.089
DRAGON: /In a land of myth
and a time of magic

00:05.173 --> 00:10.052
the destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.303 --> 00:13.055
His name, Merlin.

00:42.084 --> 00:45.463
Do you have my supplies ready?
We must leave the city without delay.

00:47.882 --> 00:49.842
Everything you asked for,
it's all here.

00:52.178 --> 00:53.304
I'm sorry.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.938
GUARD: Seize him. Stop them.

01:57.326 --> 01:59.495
Run! Run! Run!

02:45.583 --> 02:46.709
BOY: Help.

02:53.549 --> 02:54.842
Help me.

02:56.886 --> 02:58.554
Please.

03:07.188 --> 03:09.899
Please. You have to help me.

03:14.695 --> 03:15.988
Help me.

03:19.367 --> 03:20.868
GUARD: Search in there.
Take the other side.

03:24.038 --> 03:25.956
You, did you see a boy run in here?

03:27.124 --> 03:29.210
They're searching for me.

03:30.378 --> 03:32.713
MERLIN:
Why are they after you?

03:35.883 --> 03:37.551
BOY: They're going to kill me.

03:38.844 --> 03:40.679
Guards, in here.

04:00.491 --> 04:01.617
MERLIN: This way.

04:03.285 --> 04:05.454
Run. Run!

04:09.500 --> 04:10.835
Hey. There he is!

04:15.381 --> 04:16.882
Alert the rest of the guards.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.391
GUARD: In there.

04:25.474 --> 04:27.226
Quick, down there.

04:31.689 --> 04:33.274
Have you forgotten how to knock Merlin?

04:33.649 --> 04:35.609
The guards are after him.
| didn't know what to do.

04:36.485 --> 04:37.611
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

04:37.695 --> 04:39.029
GUARD: My Lady?

04:41.198 --> 04:42.283
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)

04:42.366 --> 04:43.659
My Lady?

04:44.618 --> 04:45.703
In there.

04:56.881 --> 04:58.007
Sorry to disturb you, my Lady.

04:58.841 --> 05:01.719
We're searching for a young Druid boy.
We believe he came this way.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.638
| haven't seen anyone.
It's just me and my maid.

05:04.722 --> 05:06.182
Best keep the door locked
until we find him.

05:06.474 --> 05:08.350
Of course. Thank you.

05:19.195 --> 05:22.156
The Druid was only in Camelot
to collect supplies.

05:22.239 --> 05:25.159
He meant no harm.
Is it really necessary to execute him?

05:25.242 --> 05:29.163
Absolutely necessary.
Those who use magic cannot be tolerated.

05:29.288 --> 05:30.748
The Druids are a peaceful people.

05:30.915 --> 05:33.209
Given the chance,
they'd return magic to the kingdom.

05:36.295 --> 05:39.256
They preach peace,
but conspire against me.

05:39.381 --> 05:40.466
We cannot appear weak.

05:41.133 --> 05:42.843
Showing mercy
can be a sign of strength.

05:43.344 --> 05:45.221
Our enemies will not see it that way.

05:45.930 --> 05:48.349
We have a responsibility
to protect this kingdom.

05:48.599 --> 05:51.936
Executing the Druid
will send out a clear message.

05:52.436 --> 05:54.188
Find the boy.

05:54.271 --> 05:55.356
Search every inch of the city.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.320
(BREATHING RAGGEDLY)

06:15.960 --> 06:17.503
People of Camelot.

06:17.628 --> 06:21.507
The man before you is guilty
of using enchantments and magic.

06:21.799 --> 06:24.969
Under our law, the sentence
for this crime is death.

06:26.011 --> 06:28.180
We are still searching
for his accomplice.

06:28.973 --> 06:32.309
Anyone found harboring the boy
is guilty of conspiracy

06:33.352 --> 06:35.062
and will be executed as a traitor.

06:38.148 --> 06:40.234
Let this serve as a warning
to your people.

06:40.985 --> 06:44.154
You have let your fear of magic
turn to hate.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.324
| pity you.

06:47.491 --> 06:48.659
| can't watch this.

07:01.589 --> 07:02.840
BOY: No!

07:26.363 --> 07:28.699
-Do you know much about the Druids?
-Very little.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.493
They're very secretive people.

07:31.577 --> 07:34.705
Especially now
they're being hunted by Uther.

07:37.541 --> 07:40.836
Merlin, please tell me you haven't
got yourself mixed up in this.

07:40.919 --> 07:42.212
Me? No. Mixed up in what?

07:42.296 --> 07:45.716
For someone with such a big secret,
you are a terrible liar.

07:46.383 --> 07:47.968
Well, I haven't done anything.

07:48.719 --> 07:49.762
Merlin.

07:54.058 --> 07:56.727
| heard the boy calling out.

07:57.770 --> 08:00.814
He was nowhere to be seen,
but I could hear him.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.816
Like he was inside my mind.

08:03.567 --> 08:06.070
Yes, I have heard of this ability.

08:06.737 --> 08:10.240
The Druids look for children with
such gifts to serve as apprentices.

08:11.659 --> 08:14.662
While they're searching for this boy,
you must be especially careful

08:14.745 --> 08:16.789
otherwise it will be your head
on the chopping block.

08:17.331 --> 08:20.459
-I'm always careful. You know me.
-Yes, Merlin,

08:21.001 --> 08:22.795
unfortunately I do.

08:45.609 --> 08:47.778
-How is he?
-He's sleeping.

08:49.697 --> 08:51.281
He's very pale.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.660
| worry he may have
lost a lot of blood.

09:02.126 --> 09:04.878
-Has he said anything at all?
-Nothing.

09:06.296 --> 09:07.631
He won't even tell me his name.

09:10.300 --> 09:13.137
You know, for a moment there earlier,

09:13.846 --> 09:16.348
| thought you were gonna hand us over
to the guards.

09:16.473 --> 09:18.183
I'm glad you have
so much faith in me, Merlin.

09:18.267 --> 09:20.018
No, no, sorry, um...

09:20.519 --> 09:22.563
| meant, you're the King's ward.

09:23.397 --> 09:24.815
You're taking a huge risk
helping the boy.

09:25.399 --> 09:28.318
| wouldn't see
an innocent child executed.

09:30.571 --> 09:33.073
What harm has he ever done anyone?

09:33.157 --> 09:35.033
Uther believes he has magic,
that makes him guilty.

09:35.159 --> 09:36.160
Uther's wrong.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.328
You believe that?

09:40.038 --> 09:43.208
What if magic
isn't something you choose?

09:45.335 --> 09:46.545
What if it chooses you?

09:49.840 --> 09:52.843
-Why are you looking at me like that?
-Nothing.

09:54.428 --> 09:55.554
Why are you helping him?

09:59.600 --> 10:00.934
(EXHALES)

10:01.435 --> 10:03.353
It was a spur of the moment decision.

10:07.065 --> 10:09.735
What do you think we should do with him?
He can't stay here.

10:10.027 --> 10:12.070
We have to find a way
to get him back to his people.

10:27.211 --> 10:28.295
You seem troubled, Morgana.

10:29.213 --> 10:31.882
-Is something wrong?
-No, my Lord.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.927
| am sorry I am not better company.

10:35.052 --> 10:37.304
I'm really concerned
for your welfare, that's all.

10:37.387 --> 10:40.224
Thank you, my Lord. All is well.

10:41.433 --> 10:42.601
(DOOR OPENS)

10:44.061 --> 10:45.854
UTHER: What news of the hunt
for the Druid boy?

10:45.938 --> 10:48.649
We have conducted an extensive search.

10:48.732 --> 10:49.942
The boy is nowhere to be found.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.735
You mean you failed to find him?

10:52.152 --> 10:53.403
Perhaps he's already left the city.

10:54.613 --> 10:56.073
You're telling me that a wounded boy

10:56.156 --> 10:58.116
is able to evade the guards
and escape the city?

10:58.242 --> 11:00.327
Nonsense, someone's hiding him.
| want him found.

11:00.744 --> 11:03.205
He's just a boy. What harm can he do?

11:03.288 --> 11:04.832
He is a Druid,
and that makes him dangerous.

11:05.457 --> 11:07.918
The Druids would see
your father's kingdom destroyed.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.337
| had no idea you were such an authority
on Druids.

11:10.754 --> 11:11.839
Morgana is right.

11:13.090 --> 11:15.968
-Double your efforts.
-Yes, Father.

11:17.302 --> 11:18.929
Keep searching until you find him.

11:27.771 --> 11:29.356
He's burning up.
How long has he been like this?

11:29.439 --> 11:30.524
Since early this morning.

11:31.942 --> 11:33.193
| think his wound may be infected.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.446
We need Gaius before it gets any worse.

11:36.530 --> 11:39.032
We can't involve Gaius.
It's too dangerous.

11:39.116 --> 11:41.243
Besides, if he finds out about this,
he'll execute me himself.

11:41.326 --> 11:44.371
We need to get him out of Camelot,
and we can't do that while he's sick.

11:44.454 --> 11:45.581
We need a physician.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.293
I'll treat him.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.879
Merlin, do you know how to
treat an infected wound?

11:51.962 --> 11:54.131
Not exactly, but I'm a fast learner.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.174
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

11:57.634 --> 11:59.344
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

12:13.150 --> 12:14.484
Arthur.

12:15.444 --> 12:16.653
To what do I owe this pleasure?

12:16.778 --> 12:19.239
Don't get all excited.
It's not a social call.

12:19.323 --> 12:20.782
I'm looking for the Druid boy.

12:20.866 --> 12:22.326
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
search your chambers.

12:22.451 --> 12:23.744
MORGANA: You're not
searching my chambers.

12:23.827 --> 12:26.830
Don't take it personally.
| have to search the entire castle.

12:27.331 --> 12:29.666
It will only take a few minutes.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.879
MORGANA: I'm not having you
mess up my things.

12:34.546 --> 12:36.590
ARTHUR: I'm not interested
in your things,

12:36.673 --> 12:39.509
I'm just looking for any evidence that
the Druid boy's in the castle.

12:40.844 --> 12:43.263
MORGANA: Perhaps the Druid boy's
hiding in your chambers.

12:43.347 --> 12:45.974
They're usually such a mess,
you'd never know.

12:46.058 --> 12:48.894
ARTHUR: It's hardly my fault,
| have such a lazy idiot for a servant.

12:49.019 --> 12:50.520
(CHANTING)

12:51.146 --> 12:52.397
MORGANA: If you can't even
find your own servant

12:52.522 --> 12:55.359
what hope do you have
of finding the boy?

12:56.526 --> 12:57.611
(CHANTING)

12:57.694 --> 12:59.738
ARTHUR: Really. I'm touched by
your confidence in my abilities.

12:59.863 --> 13:01.949
And as much as
I'd love to stay and talk,

13:02.032 --> 13:04.660
the sooner we get this started,
the sooner we'll be finished.

13:05.869 --> 13:06.995
(CHANTING)

13:07.412 --> 13:09.331
MORGANA: Well,
I'll save you the trouble.

13:10.248 --> 13:12.209
ARTHUR: Trust me,
if I could find him I would.

13:14.544 --> 13:16.046
The Druid boy's hiding
behind the screen.

13:19.925 --> 13:22.594
I'm sure your father would love to know

13:22.719 --> 13:25.180
how you've wasted your time
by rifling through my things.

13:26.390 --> 13:27.516
Go on.

13:29.226 --> 13:31.353
So you can have the satisfaction
of making me look a fool?

13:31.436 --> 13:33.730
In my experience you don't need any help
looking like a fool.

13:35.899 --> 13:38.485
What are you waiting for? Take a look.

13:38.568 --> 13:41.363
Why don't you go back
to brushing your hair,

13:41.446 --> 13:43.907
or whatever it is you do all day.

13:44.074 --> 13:46.743
Bye, Arthur. Good luck with the search.

13:52.958 --> 13:55.877

Can I do it later?
| was just going out.

14:24.948 --> 14:26.074
Who's had this book out?

14:27.284 --> 14:28.827
It was me. I was doing some reading.

14:29.494 --> 14:33.123
Oh, I'd given up hoping you might take
more of an interest in my work.

14:33.623 --> 14:34.875
No. It's fascinating.

14:34.958 --> 14:37.461
Merlin, you are riddle
wrapped up in a mystery.

14:38.170 --> 14:40.881
That's me. I was just getting
some cleaning supplies.

14:40.964 --> 14:43.008
Arthur's been complaining
about the sight of his chambers.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.509
| think Arthur's chambers can wait.

14:45.093 --> 14:46.887
We're not missing the chance
to begin your education.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.096
-Really. I should go.
-Sit.

14:51.516 --> 14:56.188
We'll start with some basic anatomy.

15:04.529 --> 15:06.865
-What took you so long?
-Sorry.

15:07.157 --> 15:10.494
Once Gaius gets talking about anatomy,
there's no stopping him.

15:16.500 --> 15:17.667
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

15:18.627 --> 15:19.669
I'm doing my best.

15:20.837 --> 15:22.464
I'll get you some more water.

15:26.176 --> 15:27.844
BOY: Thank you, Emrys.

15:30.472 --> 15:33.642
Emrys? Why do you call me that?

15:33.975 --> 15:36.895
Among my people, that is your name.

15:37.354 --> 15:39.856
You know who I am? How?

15:45.529 --> 15:46.863
Speak to me.

15:50.367 --> 15:54.830
| don't know if he can't speak,
or he's just too scared to.

16:19.271 --> 16:20.522
Hello?

16:25.569 --> 16:26.903
(ROARING)

16:28.113 --> 16:29.447
(GASPS)

16:29.573 --> 16:32.450
Do you have to do that?
You scared the life out of me.

16:38.206 --> 16:39.916
The young warlock.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.127
No doubt, you're here
about the Druid boy.

16:42.752 --> 16:46.590
-How did you know?
-Like you, I hear him speak.

16:46.715 --> 16:48.842
Why does he call me Emrys?

16:49.259 --> 16:50.927
Because that is your name.

16:51.595 --> 16:54.347
I'm pretty sure my name's Merlin,
always has been.

16:54.514 --> 16:57.267
-You have many names.
-Do 1?

16:59.561 --> 17:01.188
How does the boy know who I am?

17:01.730 --> 17:03.273
I've never even met any Druids.

17:03.398 --> 17:07.944
There is much written about you
that you have yet to read.

17:09.779 --> 17:11.740
You should not protect this boy.

17:13.450 --> 17:16.368
Why? He has magic. He's just like me.

17:16.536 --> 17:20.415
You and the boy are
as different as day and night.

17:20.707 --> 17:24.211
-What do you mean?
-Heed my words, Merlin.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.128
Why should I not protect him?

17:38.433 --> 17:40.477
(PANTING)

17:43.939 --> 17:47.275
Let me care for him for a while.
You need to sleep.

17:47.901 --> 17:50.070
You'll make yourself sick
if you go on like this.

17:50.153 --> 17:51.446
His fever's getting worse.

17:52.614 --> 17:54.115
BOY: Morgana.

17:55.325 --> 17:56.910
-Did you hear that?
-What?

17:56.993 --> 17:58.662
He said my name.

17:59.162 --> 18:00.830
GWEN: Did he?
| didn't hear anything.

18:01.164 --> 18:02.582
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

18:02.666 --> 18:04.167
It's Merlin.

18:17.847 --> 18:20.267
-How is he?
-He's getting weaker.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.477
What you did yesterday hasn't worked.

18:22.811 --> 18:24.020
We have to ask Gaius for his help.

18:26.106 --> 18:28.692
After all you've done,
you can't give up now.

18:30.110 --> 18:33.196
Please. If he doesn't
receive treatment, he'll die.

18:34.781 --> 18:35.949
Okay.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.371
The search for this Druid boy
is becoming a real nuisance.

18:41.705 --> 18:43.873
With all the extra security
around the castle,

18:43.999 --> 18:47.002
it's taking me twice as long
to do my round.

18:47.544 --> 18:49.379
Is that everything?

18:52.048 --> 18:53.842
Morgana is hiding
the Druid boy in her chambers.

19:04.352 --> 19:06.813
When you say that Morgana
is hiding the Druid boy,

19:06.896 --> 19:08.982
| take it that means
that you're helping her?

19:09.566 --> 19:10.734
Sort of.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.069
Merlin, you promised me that
you wouldn't get involved.

19:13.862 --> 19:17.157
| know. I'm sorry. I had no choice.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.701
Every guard in Camelot
is searching for this boy,

19:20.076 --> 19:21.995
and you harboring him
under their very noses.

19:22.078 --> 19:24.748
Can't you see how dangerous that is?
What were you thinking of?

19:24.831 --> 19:26.916
Was I supposed to hand him over
to the guards to be executed?

19:27.000 --> 19:28.501
You think you can save this boy?

19:28.585 --> 19:30.420
What happens if you're caught?
Who's going to save you?

19:30.503 --> 19:32.839
You're saying it's wrong
to harbor a young magician?

19:43.058 --> 19:46.269
The difference is, Merlin,
that your magic is still secret,

19:46.394 --> 19:50.190
though it's a wonder how,
considering how careless you are.

19:51.358 --> 19:54.069
The boy's hurt. He's really sick.

19:55.445 --> 19:57.447
I've tried to treat him.

19:59.074 --> 20:00.200
We need your help.

20:00.742 --> 20:02.952
So now you want me to risk my neck too?

20:04.287 --> 20:06.581
| wish the boy no harm,
but it's too dangerous.

20:06.790 --> 20:08.792
If you don't, we may as well
hand him over to the guards,

20:08.875 --> 20:10.043
because he'll die anyway.

20:12.796 --> 20:14.964
You didn't turn your back on me.

20:16.424 --> 20:18.968
Please don't turn your back on him.

20:24.057 --> 20:26.142
(EXHALING)

20:36.069 --> 20:37.612
GAIUS: I will treat the boy,

20:38.071 --> 20:40.573
but as soon as he is well,
you must get him out of Camelot.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.660
And woe betide
anyone caught helping him.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.671
Well, one thing we know for certain.

20:55.004 --> 20:56.131
What's that?

20:57.257 --> 20:59.092
You're no physician.

21:00.969 --> 21:02.345
Halt there.

21:03.847 --> 21:06.433
The guards are searching
everyone leaving the town.

21:06.516 --> 21:09.686
There is another way out.
There's a secret door in the armory.

21:10.019 --> 21:12.021
It leads to the lower town.
I'll take the boy out that way.

21:12.689 --> 21:15.191
No. It's too dangerous. I'll do it.

21:17.110 --> 21:18.945
I'm good with secret doors
and things...

21:19.362 --> 21:20.864
If you get caught,
Uther will execute you.

21:22.198 --> 21:26.035
The boy's my responsibility.
I'll smuggle him out of the castle.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.829
Well, you'll need a key for the door.

21:28.830 --> 21:31.207
-Who has it?
-Arthur.

-What?

21:55.315 --> 21:57.650
-There was a sound.
-Was there?

-I can't hear anything.

22:13.333 --> 22:16.169
Are you deaf?
It's like a jangling sound.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.423
(KEYS CLINKING)

22:30.558 --> 22:31.726

22:36.231 --> 22:37.690
-What was that?
-What was what?

22:37.774 --> 22:40.193
A different sound, like a splash.

22:43.404 --> 22:44.614
Bread?

22:59.587 --> 23:01.005
MORGANA: It will have to do.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.343
| feel I have put you in danger

23:05.426 --> 23:07.637
without ever stopping to ask
how you feel about it.

23:08.513 --> 23:09.681
I'm sorry.

23:09.764 --> 23:12.600
| know how it feels to face
the threat of execution

23:12.684 --> 23:14.227

23:22.986 --> 23:25.405
| won't let anything bad happen to you.
| promise.

23:27.991 --> 23:29.158
Are you ready?

23:31.035 --> 23:33.913
-Did you get the keys?
-Yeah.

23:35.123 --> 23:38.751
The door is behind the shield
at the far end of the armory.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.795
I'll pack you some food
and water for the journey.

23:42.338 --> 23:43.423
Be careful.

24:06.821 --> 24:07.989

24:44.859 --> 24:46.694

24:47.528 --> 24:49.155
Morgana really cares about the boy.

24:49.238 --> 24:50.990
I've never seen her this way
with anyone.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.495
I'm sure she just wants to protect him.

24:56.371 --> 24:57.497
Hmm.

25:04.420 --> 25:08.091
A servant saw someone entering.
They had a boy with them.

-I'm the king's ward.

-I'll take my chances.
-Morgana...

| couldn't live with myself if anything
happened to either of you.

He's just a child.

How could you betray me like this?

| would not see him executed.

27:57.260 --> 27:59.095
| treated you like a daughter.

Is this how you repay me?

| did what I thought was right.

28:02.139 --> 28:04.433
You think it is right to conspire
with my enemies against me?

How can this child be your enemy?
He's just a boy.

28:06.602 --> 28:07.687
He is a Druid.

28:07.770 --> 28:09.772
-Is that such a crime?
-His kind would see me dead

28:09.897 --> 28:12.400
and this kingdom returned to anarchy
and you would help them.

| beg you.

Make arrangements for the boy
to be executed tomorrow morning.

No! Please. He has done nothing.

-You don't have to do this.
-Do you hear me?

-I want him executed at dawn.
-Yes, Father.

Why are you so full of hate?

28:36.799 --> 28:39.135
Enough! I will not hear another word!

28:39.302 --> 28:43.014
Do not speak to me until you are ready
to apologize for what you've done.

anything bad happen to him.

You can't blame yourself.
You tried your best.

29:05.786 --> 29:06.871
It's not enough.

29:13.002 --> 29:15.171
He's in jail now.
There's nothing more we can do.

Can I count on your help?

29:31.687 --> 29:32.855
Thank you.

29:39.487 --> 29:42.073
Perhaps imprisonment is
a more suitable punishment for the boy.

29:42.198 --> 29:43.240
| mean he's so young.

29:43.366 --> 29:44.992
You would allow him

This is harsh but necessary.
| take no pleasure in killing the boy.

29:55.878 --> 29:58.130
Then spare him for Morgana's sake.

29:58.214 --> 29:59.924
She's clearly grown attached to the boy

30:00.049 --> 30:02.051
and if you execute him
| fear she'll never forgive you.

30:02.176 --> 30:05.554
| do not seek her forgiveness!

30:07.390 --> 30:09.350
She has betrayed me.

30:13.896 --> 30:15.231
And yet you are sparing her?

30:18.067 --> 30:20.778
She has the promise I made to her father
to thank for that.

30:21.362 --> 30:23.739
The boy enjoys no such privilege.

30:25.408 --> 30:28.911
He will be executed at dawn.
Is that clear?

30:40.881 --> 30:42.758
Make yourself at home.

30:43.759 --> 30:45.636
You can't let your father
execute the boy.

30:45.761 --> 30:48.305
You're lucky he's not executing you.

30:48.597 --> 30:51.183
Are you telling me he really was
behind the screen

30:51.267 --> 30:52.601
when I came to search your chambers?

30:56.272 --> 30:58.774
| know you believe
your father's wrong to execute him.

30:58.899 --> 31:01.235
What I believe doesn't matter.

31:02.111 --> 31:03.446
My father's made up his mind.

31:03.571 --> 31:05.322
He won't be talked out of it.

31:05.448 --> 31:06.490
| tried.

31:07.950 --> 31:09.618
Then the time for talking is over.

31:09.744 --> 31:12.204
Whatever you're thinking
is not going to happen.

31:12.288 --> 31:13.664
We have to get the boy
back to his people.

31:13.789 --> 31:15.291
No. Forget it.

| can't believe you'd
let an innocent child die.

31:17.668 --> 31:18.961
It's too late.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.464
He's been caught.

31:23.007 --> 31:24.717
| have no choice.

31:25.384 --> 31:28.471
And is this how you will rule
when you are king?

31:28.971 --> 31:31.223
You're not like your father.

31:33.350 --> 31:35.019
| will not betray him.

31:35.144 --> 31:36.979
If I know you at all,

31:37.354 --> 31:39.065
you won't stand by and let this happen.

31:41.817 --> 31:43.027
Please.

31:45.905 --> 31:47.823
If you won't do this for the boy,

31:49.200 --> 31:50.993
then do it for me.

32:12.681 --> 32:15.017
Sorry. Was I interrupting something?

32:15.101 --> 32:16.685
It's nothing you need
concern yourself with.

32:17.061 --> 32:19.021
Go make yourself useful.
Muck out my horses.

32:20.689 --> 32:21.857

32:32.535 --> 32:34.453
We're going to break the Druid boy
out of the dungeons.

32:35.371 --> 32:37.665
-You can't do that.
-We have to.

32:37.748 --> 32:40.876
-Uther's gonna execute him at dawn.
-I mean...

32:43.587 --> 32:47.049
It's too dangerous.
You've already been caught once.

32:47.383 --> 32:49.760
And if the King catches you
a second time he'll never forgive you.

32:49.885 --> 32:51.470
-I'm not worried for myself.
-Merlin's right.

32:52.221 --> 32:54.056
When my father finds out
the boy's escaped,

32:54.140 --> 32:55.558
he will suspect you being involved.

32:55.933 --> 32:57.059
It's suicide.

32:58.435 --> 33:02.064
You must go to my father and apologize.
Dine with him.

33:02.398 --> 33:05.109
He cannot hold you responsible
if you're with him when the boy escapes.

33:05.234 --> 33:09.405
You need me if the plan is to work.
You can't do this on your own.

33:11.740 --> 33:14.243
-Merlin will take your place.
-Me?

33:15.828 --> 33:17.913
I'm going to take the boy out
through the burial vaults.

33:17.997 --> 33:20.416
There's a tunnel that leads
beyond the city walls.

33:20.583 --> 33:22.668
Get my horse from my stables
and meet me there.

33:22.751 --> 33:24.753
There's a grate that covers
the entrance to the tunnel.

33:24.837 --> 33:26.964
Bring a rope and a grappling hook
to pull it off.

33:27.089 --> 33:30.467
-No, I can't...
-Merlin. Do you understand?

33:31.594 --> 33:35.139
If you're not there to meet us,
we'll surely be caught.

33:48.444 --> 33:51.197
| need to know why you told me
not to protect the boy.

33:51.280 --> 33:54.783
You seek my counsel,
and yet you choose to ignore it.

33:55.326 --> 33:57.953
-Just tell me why.
-If the boy lives,

33:58.287 --> 34:01.123
you cannot fulfill your destiny.

34:01.498 --> 34:02.833
What's he got to do with my destiny?

34:02.958 --> 34:05.461
You said it's my destiny
to protect Arthur?

34:05.794 --> 34:08.464
Then you have the answer you seek.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.010
You're telling me

34:14.136 --> 34:16.304
that little boy is going to kill Arthur?

34:16.679 --> 34:19.475
It seems that is up to you.

34:25.813 --> 34:26.857
No.

34:28.817 --> 34:30.527
You can't know that for certain.

34:30.652 --> 34:35.074
You have it in your power
to prevent a great evil.

34:35.741 --> 34:38.786
There must be another way.
The future isn't set in stone.

34:38.869 --> 34:41.830
You must let the boy die.

34:57.513 --> 34:59.306
| presume it is the plight
of the Druid boy

34:59.390 --> 35:03.352
that's causing your forehead
to wrinkle like a lizard's elbow.

35:07.106 --> 35:09.358
Would you let something terrible happen

35:10.150 --> 35:14.697
if it meant you'd stop something
even worse happening in the future?

35:15.072 --> 35:16.907
| suppose it depends

35:16.991 --> 35:20.286
what the "terrible"
and "even worse things" were.

35:20.577 --> 35:22.371
One of them is bad,

35:23.455 --> 35:24.873
really bad.

35:27.209 --> 35:29.003
And the other, it's

35:30.713 --> 35:32.172
unthinkable.

35:33.674 --> 35:35.884
It sounds as if you've already
made your decision.

35:38.679 --> 35:42.141
You can only do what
you believe to be right, Merlin.

35:42.933 --> 35:46.478
| just hope it doesn't involve
you putting yourself in terrible danger.

35:51.650 --> 35:54.153
For once, you don't have to worry.

35:56.989 --> 35:58.198
I'm going to do nothing.

36:09.209 --> 36:10.586
Thank you.

36:12.546 --> 36:13.630
What is it?

36:14.506 --> 36:15.674
What's wrong?

36:17.468 --> 36:19.303
You're risking so much for this boy.

36:19.762 --> 36:22.723
You don't know anything about him.
You don't even know his name.

36:23.557 --> 36:24.808
There's a bond between us.

36:25.100 --> 36:26.769
Stronger than the bond
you have with Uther?

36:28.896 --> 36:31.690
It's like nothing I've ever felt before.

36:33.400 --> 36:34.818
Perhaps I was always meant to help him.

36:35.152 --> 36:36.403
How can that be?

36:37.571 --> 36:38.947
| don't know.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.494
| can't explain it.

36:49.375 --> 36:50.542
| must go to Uther.

36:53.462 --> 36:54.838
Good luck.

37:15.484 --> 37:17.486
| have come to apologize, my Lord.

37:20.989 --> 37:24.243
You have been generous, kind and fair.

37:26.120 --> 37:27.871
And I owe you everything.

37:30.124 --> 37:31.959
| truly don't know what came over me.

37:33.585 --> 37:36.588
| acted without thinking
of the consequence.

37:38.549 --> 37:40.843
My behavior was unforgivable.

37:41.260 --> 37:42.803
(CRYING)

37:44.221 --> 37:46.098
| am glad you have seen sense.

37:48.183 --> 37:49.393
Dine with me.

37:50.018 --> 37:53.564
Let's put this unfortunate incident
behind us.

38:14.334 --> 38:16.420
(COUGHING)

38:43.197 --> 38:44.865
Don't be scared.

38:44.948 --> 38:47.743
| have sent word to your people.
I'm taking you to them.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.161
You must come with me.

38:55.209 --> 38:56.627
This way.

39:07.596 --> 39:08.972
It's the Druid boy. He's escaped!

39:20.150 --> 39:21.276
ARTHUR: Merlin.

39:22.778 --> 39:24.029
Merlin.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.868
Don't worry, he'll be here.

39:34.373 --> 39:36.458
(BELLS TOLLING)

39:37.793 --> 39:38.961
Guard!

39:40.546 --> 39:42.422
Find out why
they sounded the warning bell.

39:42.506 --> 39:44.007
Yes, my Lord.

39:49.137 --> 39:50.430
(GRUNTING)

39:51.974 --> 39:53.308
Damn it, Merlin!

39:53.392 --> 39:54.977
(DOOR OPENING)

40:01.483 --> 40:03.569
(GUARDS CHATTERING)

40:20.961 --> 40:22.379
BOY: Emrys?

40:24.172 --> 40:25.382
Emrys?

40:28.218 --> 40:30.095
Where are you, Emrys?

40:30.971 --> 40:32.180
Emrys?

40:32.806 --> 40:35.225
Help us. Please!

40:36.810 --> 40:37.894
They're coming...

40:40.731 --> 40:43.025
(GUARDS TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

40:50.407 --> 40:53.285
I'm scared, Emrys. They will kill me.

40:54.369 --> 40:56.913
Don't do this. Don't ignore me.

40:57.706 --> 40:59.708
I know you can hear me.

40:59.791 --> 41:02.085
| thought you were my friend.

41:02.502 --> 41:05.380
We're the same. I don't want to die.

41:06.214 --> 41:08.675
Emrys! Emrys!

41:09.635 --> 41:10.886
Emrys!

41:22.939 --> 41:24.066
Hey!

41:24.941 --> 41:26.193
Where the hell have you been?

41:26.276 --> 41:27.944
| had trouble
getting out of the castle.

41:28.028 --> 41:30.697
ARTHUR: Well, get this grate off.
They're coming.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.878
If my father asks where I am,
I've gone on a hunting trip.

41:45.754 --> 41:46.880
You'd better make yourself scarce,

41:46.963 --> 41:49.549
or they'll execute you in his place.

41:51.593 --> 41:53.428
BOY: Goodbye, Emrys.

41:54.179 --> 41:57.140
| know that someday we will meet again.

42:09.361 --> 42:11.071
My Lord. I regret to report that

42:11.154 --> 42:12.989
the Druid boy has escaped
from the dungeon.

42:13.240 --> 42:15.158
What? How?

42:15.659 --> 42:18.161
My Lord, he was assisted
by some accomplices.

42:18.245 --> 42:20.455
The guards are searching Camelot
as we speak.

42:20.539 --> 42:24.000
Find him, and his accomplices,
and kill them.

42:24.292 --> 42:25.377
Yes, my Lord.

42:29.673 --> 42:34.094
If I discover that you were somehow
involved in freeing this boy,

42:34.469 --> 42:38.682
the consequences
will be extremely severe.

42:40.100 --> 42:43.645
My Lord, you know I respect you too much
to ever betray you like that.

42:43.729 --> 42:47.399
| made a promise to your father
that I would protect you.

42:48.316 --> 42:50.235
But if you cross me again,

42:50.318 --> 42:53.864
| will break that promise
without a second thought.

43:37.199 --> 43:39.242
We are forever indebted to you
Arthur Pendragon

43:39.367 --> 43:41.203
for returning the boy to us.

43:41.703 --> 43:44.831
You must not let it be known
that it was I who brought him to you.

43:44.915 --> 43:47.876
We will tell no one. You have my word.

44:00.305 --> 44:02.557
Wait. I don't even know your name.

44:05.602 --> 44:06.728
At least tell me your name.

44:08.230 --> 44:09.397
It's all right.

44:11.900 --> 44:13.735
My name is Mordred.

44:17.072 --> 44:18.907
Good luck, Mordred.

44:49.312 --> 44:51.273
GAIUS: Tristan's tomb is empty.

44:51.356 --> 44:52.691
UTHER: Dead men do not return.

44:54.609 --> 44:56.152
Single combat. To the death.

44:59.781 --> 45:01.950
GAIUS: I believe he's been
conjured from the dead.

45:02.033 --> 45:03.285
This will be your death.

45:03.410 --> 45:07.038
MERLIN: I need to find a weapon
that will kill the dead.

45:09.666 --> 45:11.376
(ROARING)
