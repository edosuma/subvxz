All clear up here.

00:13.986 --> 00:15.653
Yeah, same here.

00:15.654 --> 00:19.756
Ditto.

00:19.757 --> 00:22.292
Copy that, I'm arriving now.

00:35.591 --> 00:36.634
James?

00:36.635 --> 00:39.250
It's me, magnus.

00:39.251 --> 00:40.289
Over here.

00:45.451 --> 00:46.457
It's good to see you.

00:46.458 --> 00:48.165
You too, helen.

00:49.907 --> 00:52.148
I love the hair.

00:52.149 --> 00:53.252
Thank you.

00:53.253 --> 00:55.493
Any problems?

00:55.494 --> 00:57.534
No, package
is safe and sound.

01:00.380 --> 01:03.822
Although I'll be very happy
to be rid of this one.

01:03.823 --> 01:07.302
Little warmer than I'm used to.

01:07.303 --> 01:08.772
That's what you get

01:08.773 --> 01:10.344
For transporting
a tunisian fire elemental.

01:10.345 --> 01:12.249
I have a cryo-container
in the van.

01:12.250 --> 01:13.786
<i>Magnus,
we got company.</i>

01:13.787 --> 01:15.258
Two cars headed your way.

01:18.868 --> 01:20.939
I got 'em.

01:24.751 --> 01:25.852
All right, fan out.

01:25.853 --> 01:29.395
They can't be far.

01:30.632 --> 01:33.305
Eight
scary-looking dudes.

01:33.306 --> 01:34.641
They're searching the area.

01:35.644 --> 01:36.645
The duke.

01:36.646 --> 01:38.483
Who?

01:38.484 --> 01:40.321
Head of the abnormal mob
back in chicago.

01:40.322 --> 01:41.490
Damn.

01:41.491 --> 01:42.659
He's the one who hired me

01:42.660 --> 01:44.362
To bring him
the elemental.

01:44.363 --> 01:45.531
You stole this
from a mob boss?

01:45.532 --> 01:48.303
I wasn't about to let it
fall into his hands.

01:48.304 --> 01:49.438
How did he find us?

01:49.439 --> 01:50.807
You tell me.

01:50.808 --> 01:52.444
I think your organization
sprung a leak.

01:52.445 --> 01:53.346
No. Impossible.

01:54.683 --> 01:57.522
Henry,
we need a diversion.

01:57.523 --> 01:58.557
<i>I'm on it.</i>

02:52.685 --> 02:54.653
[tires squealing]

02:54.654 --> 02:56.957
Get in!

02:56.958 --> 02:58.893
Go!

02:58.894 --> 03:01.030
Protect the package!
Go!

03:01.031 --> 03:02.732
Please go!

03:02.733 --> 03:03.701
[shots blast]

03:10.946 --> 03:13.883
[gunshots blast]

03:24.198 --> 03:26.500
They're on the move,
headed north!

03:30.039 --> 03:32.708
Henry, will,
kate's got jimmy.

03:32.709 --> 03:35.044
Meet at the rendezvous.

03:35.045 --> 03:37.514
Hell, yeah. Copy that.

03:43.223 --> 03:46.827
Nice work.
I think we lost them.

03:46.828 --> 03:48.529
So where are we headed?

03:53.036 --> 03:54.303
Why are we slowing down?

03:55.272 --> 03:56.273
Hey, hey, hey!

03:56.274 --> 03:58.809
[horn honking]

03:58.810 --> 04:00.578

Sync by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com

04:45.593 --> 04:46.626
Any sign of them?

04:46.627 --> 04:47.693
Not yet.

04:47.694 --> 04:49.262
Maybe they got
turned around.

04:49.263 --> 04:50.864
Ii's been too long.

04:50.865 --> 04:52.399
Kate, come in.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.566
Kate, do you read?

04:53.567 --> 04:54.668
Maybe she dumped
her walkie.

04:54.669 --> 04:56.236
Try her cell phone.

04:56.237 --> 04:58.871
Yeah.

04:58.872 --> 05:00.239
[ringing]

05:00.240 --> 05:01.473
Great.

05:01.474 --> 05:03.308
I'll call
the big guy,

05:03.309 --> 05:04.510
See if she showed up
at the sanctuary.

05:04.511 --> 05:05.779
Thank you.

05:05.780 --> 05:07.282
Who the hell
were those guys?

05:07.283 --> 05:08.984
Abnormals from chicago.

05:08.985 --> 05:10.285
James stole the elemental
from them.

05:10.286 --> 05:12.487
Well, that's wonderful.

05:12.488 --> 05:13.755
The real question is

05:13.756 --> 05:14.789
How the hell were they able
to track us?

05:14.790 --> 05:15.756
We told no one
about this meeting.

05:15.757 --> 05:17.892
Maybe they followed him.

05:17.893 --> 05:19.159
I've worked with james before.

05:19.160 --> 05:20.493
He knows better
than to let this happen.

05:20.494 --> 05:22.261
She's not
at the sanctuary either.

05:22.262 --> 05:24.566
All right, go back
and check with our contacts.

05:24.567 --> 05:25.733
Find out if anyone's seen them,

05:25.734 --> 05:27.065
And, henry,

05:27.066 --> 05:28.900
I want to know how
this duke character found us.

05:28.901 --> 05:30.866
All right.

05:40.237 --> 05:41.270
[coughs weakly]

06:11.396 --> 06:13.663
[groans groggily]

06:13.664 --> 06:16.299
Easy! Easy,
easy, easy...

06:16.300 --> 06:17.867
I'm just looking at the wound.

06:21.671 --> 06:24.306
We're going to have to get
that bullet out.

06:24.307 --> 06:26.441
We should get back
to the sanctuary.

06:26.442 --> 06:28.510
No, we'd never make it.

06:28.511 --> 06:29.878
In case
you haven't noticed,

06:29.879 --> 06:30.578
There's a bunch
of guys out there

06:30.579 --> 06:31.880
Trying to kill us.

06:31.881 --> 06:34.381
Call magnus.
She'll pick us up.

06:34.382 --> 06:36.717
No can do.
Your walkie's toast.

06:36.718 --> 06:40.521
Besides, we don't know
how those guys found us.

06:40.522 --> 06:41.622
They could be monitoring
our communications.

06:41.623 --> 06:43.056
[groans in pain]

06:43.057 --> 06:44.457
[wincing]

06:44.458 --> 06:45.792
If you think magnus
tipped them off,

06:45.793 --> 06:46.859
Then you're crazy.

06:46.860 --> 06:49.595
No, not her, but
there is a leak.

06:49.596 --> 06:51.496
[cries out in pain]

06:51.497 --> 06:52.830
Until we find out
where it is,

06:52.831 --> 06:55.399
We can't risk
getting in touch with anyone.

06:55.400 --> 06:56.934
[gasping]

06:56.935 --> 06:58.802
I need you...

06:58.803 --> 07:00.671
To stay still.

07:00.672 --> 07:01.805
Are you nuts? No!

07:01.806 --> 07:03.373
Come on!

07:03.374 --> 07:05.342
If I don't get the bullet out,
you are going to bleed to death.

07:05.343 --> 07:06.476
Is that what you want?

07:09.748 --> 07:11.615
Here, you do me a favor.

07:11.616 --> 07:12.716
You take this,

07:12.717 --> 07:13.850
You point this
at the door.

07:13.851 --> 07:15.120
Anyone comes through,

07:15.121 --> 07:16.622
You blow them
away, okay?

07:16.623 --> 07:18.957
And, um...

07:18.958 --> 07:20.758
You know,
try not to move too much.

07:25.930 --> 07:27.263
It was a beat-up
gray sedan.

07:27.264 --> 07:28.364
They shot out a couple
of the windows.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.832
If she was headed
straight to the rendezvous,

07:30.833 --> 07:33.067
She would've turned left
at the first opportunity.

07:33.068 --> 07:34.535
Unless she were going
to the sanctuary,

07:34.536 --> 07:35.969
In which case she would've
kept going straight.

07:38.072 --> 07:40.006
Why were they
shooting at him anyway?

07:40.007 --> 07:41.774
Seems like a dangerous way
to bring in an abnormal.

07:41.775 --> 07:43.107
Well, it's the container
they're after.

07:43.108 --> 07:44.440
He doesn't have to be alive

07:44.441 --> 07:46.340
For them
to collect it.

07:46.341 --> 07:48.075
<i>Magnus, come in.</i>

07:48.076 --> 07:49.610
How's it going, henry?

07:49.611 --> 07:50.711
<i>Yeah, I put the word out
about kate,</i>

07:50.712 --> 07:51.879
But nothing's come back yet.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.046
Big guy's checking to see

07:53.047 --> 07:55.115
If anything got caught
on surveillance videos.

07:55.116 --> 07:56.783
<i>What about
the system scan?</i>

07:56.784 --> 07:57.917
Yeah, still processing,

07:57.918 --> 07:59.117
But in the meantime,

07:59.118 --> 08:02.520
I did some research
into this abnormal mob.

08:02.521 --> 08:04.821
Turns out
their leader's a diukon.

08:05.856 --> 08:07.089
What's a diukon?

08:07.090 --> 08:09.725
Highly aggressive
humanoid offshoot.

08:09.726 --> 08:12.061
They suffer from
uncontrollable bouts of rage

08:12.062 --> 08:14.463
So powerful they literally
can't contain it.

08:14.464 --> 08:16.431
What do you mean,
they can't contain it?

08:16.432 --> 08:20.001
Diukons have special glands
in their hands

08:20.002 --> 08:21.402
That secrete radiation
when they get angry.

08:21.403 --> 08:23.637
If they grab hold of you,
it's very unpleasant.

08:23.638 --> 08:24.704
Yeah, they cook you
from the inside out

08:24.705 --> 08:25.704
Like a microwave...

08:25.705 --> 08:26.838
Or so I've heard.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.807
Henry, how
is it possible

08:28.808 --> 08:30.442
That a diukon
is leading a street gang?

08:30.443 --> 08:32.043
There's no known suppressant
for their anger.

08:32.044 --> 08:33.510
Yeah, I have no idea,

08:33.511 --> 08:35.979
But somebody's giving this guy
some serious happy pills.

08:35.980 --> 08:37.447
According to this,
six months ago

08:37.448 --> 08:39.381
He was pit-fighting
other abnormals for cash.

08:39.383 --> 08:41.616
Now he's the boss.

08:50.991 --> 08:52.825
[knock  n door]

08:58.896 --> 09:02.063
How'd it go?

09:02.064 --> 09:03.398
We lost him.

09:04.499 --> 09:05.699
He got away

09:05.700 --> 09:07.066
With a member
of the sanctuary,

09:07.067 --> 09:09.468
Kate freelander,

09:09.469 --> 09:11.202
But word is

09:11.203 --> 09:15.139
That they never made it
back to the sanctuary.

09:15.140 --> 09:17.073
So where are they now?

09:17.074 --> 09:20.209
We don't know.

09:20.210 --> 09:22.611
What about our
monitoring capability?

09:22.612 --> 09:25.516
It's still
in place,

09:25.517 --> 09:26.651
But we have no way

09:26.652 --> 09:28.621
To locate freelander
specifically.

09:28.622 --> 09:30.791
Her radio signal
went dead.

09:30.792 --> 09:33.060
Look, boss, we'll find him.

09:33.061 --> 09:34.162
Don't worry.

09:34.163 --> 09:36.165
Oh...

09:36.166 --> 09:38.567
I'm not the one
that needs to worry.

09:38.568 --> 09:41.035
[roarage]

09:41.036 --> 09:42.036
Duke...

09:42.037 --> 09:43.037
Duke!

09:43.038 --> 09:45.506
[screams]: Ow!

09:45.507 --> 09:48.242
[gasping and panting in pain]

09:51.245 --> 09:53.946
Get him out of here.

09:53.947 --> 09:58.516
Looks like those rage
parameters
need a tweak.

09:58.517 --> 09:59.717
I...

09:59.718 --> 10:02.686
Think I lost control
for a second.

10:02.687 --> 10:04.521
I'll run a diagnostic.

10:04.522 --> 10:07.123
Yeah.

10:07.124 --> 10:08.625
[exhales heavily]

10:08.626 --> 10:10.626
And keep monitoring
the sanctuary frequency.

10:12.162 --> 10:13.996
As long as
freelander's out there,

10:13.997 --> 10:15.964
I want to keep tabs on them.

10:17.833 --> 10:19.000
Oh, and, uh...

10:21.503 --> 10:24.070
I'm going to need
a new one of these.

10:24.071 --> 10:26.539
Okay...

10:26.540 --> 10:28.775
This is going to hurt.

10:28.776 --> 10:29.709
[whimpers in fear]

10:29.710 --> 10:30.709
No...

10:30.710 --> 10:32.912
[wincing]

10:32.913 --> 10:33.979
Okay...

10:35.115 --> 10:37.550
[screams]

10:37.551 --> 10:38.617
Come on, come on...

10:38.618 --> 10:41.718
You've got to stay still.

10:43.253 --> 10:44.620
You got any morphine?

10:44.621 --> 10:46.922
Please, I wish.
I could use some.

10:46.923 --> 10:49.724
Here.

10:49.725 --> 10:51.025
[coughing]

10:52.727 --> 10:54.995
Hell of a first date, huh?

10:54.996 --> 10:58.330
I've had worse.

10:58.331 --> 10:59.798
I'm jimmy,
by the way.

10:59.799 --> 11:02.133
[cries out in pain]

11:02.134 --> 11:03.868
"hi, jimmy, I'm... "

11:03.869 --> 11:04.968
Kate.

11:05.970 --> 11:07.837
Where you from, kate?

11:07.838 --> 11:09.938
I grew up in chicago.

11:09.939 --> 11:11.706
Chicago, no kidding?
Me too.

11:11.707 --> 11:12.707
What part?

11:12.708 --> 11:13.941
[groans]

11:13.942 --> 11:16.543
West side.

11:16.544 --> 11:17.844
Cal city.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.678
Cal city?

11:19.679 --> 11:20.846
That's not chicago.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.580
Says who?

11:22.581 --> 11:24.882
Anyone actually from chicago.

11:24.883 --> 11:25.949
[groans and whimpers]

11:25.950 --> 11:27.317
Yeah, I'm sorry.

11:27.318 --> 11:28.985
It's in kind of deep.

11:28.986 --> 11:30.253
Oh, god...

11:30.254 --> 11:31.587
It's still not chicago.

11:38.161 --> 11:40.130
Want to continue
on foot?

11:40.131 --> 11:41.733
Well, if
what you say is true,

11:41.734 --> 11:43.704
And kate really has
gone into hiding,

11:43.705 --> 11:44.939
We'll never find her
from the car.

11:44.940 --> 11:46.674
Okay.

11:46.675 --> 11:48.876
Any particular direction
you have an affinity for?

11:48.877 --> 11:50.711
You go east,
I'll go west.

11:50.712 --> 11:51.945
Proceed one block
at a time.

11:51.946 --> 11:53.646
Stay in
radio contact.

11:53.647 --> 11:56.215
All right.

12:08.359 --> 12:09.393
[yelping in pain]

12:09.394 --> 12:10.660
Easy,
I almost got it!

12:10.661 --> 12:11.928
[crying]

12:11.929 --> 12:13.696
[screams]

12:13.697 --> 12:15.331
[sobbing]

12:15.332 --> 12:16.932
There!

12:19.635 --> 12:22.069
You can save this one
for your collection.

12:24.005 --> 12:26.273
Kate?

12:28.776 --> 12:31.010
No, no, no,
no, no...

12:31.011 --> 12:31.978
No, no, no, no, no.

12:39.985 --> 12:42.653
Come on, westside,
don't give up on me.

12:42.654 --> 12:46.057
[cell phone rings]

12:46.058 --> 12:47.224
Go ahead, henry.

12:47.225 --> 12:48.326
Destroy your walkie
right now.

12:51.663 --> 12:53.664
Now, tell me
why I just did that.

12:53.665 --> 12:55.099
<i>We got hit with
a remote hack.</i>

12:55.100 --> 12:57.067
They're using our radio
frequencies to track us.

12:57.068 --> 12:58.035
Where's will?

12:58.036 --> 12:59.336
He's not with me.

12:59.337 --> 13:00.804
He's not
answering his cell.

13:00.805 --> 13:01.805
Dammit.

13:05.143 --> 13:07.944
Will!

13:19.075 --> 13:20.675
Easy...

13:20.676 --> 13:22.176
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.899
W-what happened?

13:29.900 --> 13:31.233
Oh, nothing much.

13:31.234 --> 13:33.702
You, uh,
stopped breathing,

13:33.703 --> 13:35.536
So I, uh,

13:35.537 --> 13:38.639
Took the opportunity
to make out with you.

13:40.441 --> 13:41.941
Thanks.

13:41.942 --> 13:45.309
Come on, what are
casual acquaintances for?

13:48.880 --> 13:51.281
I'm sorry, doc.

13:51.282 --> 13:53.282
It's all right.
You had no way of knowing.

13:53.283 --> 13:54.750
<i>Whoever did this
is sophisticated.</i>

13:54.751 --> 13:56.818
I'm going to have to re-encrypt
all the com frequencies.

13:56.819 --> 13:57.852
<i>Understood.</i>

13:57.853 --> 13:59.821
I'll see you soon.

14:02.559 --> 14:04.428
[gasps and groans]

14:06.330 --> 14:07.664
[winces]

14:07.665 --> 14:09.266
What's wrong?

14:09.267 --> 14:10.968
Oh, nothing...

14:10.969 --> 14:14.505
Except for this 1,200-degree
abnormal inside of me,

14:14.506 --> 14:15.639
I'm-I'm fine.

14:15.640 --> 14:17.340
Why don't you take it out?

14:17.341 --> 14:20.977
We need
a cryo-container to put it
into.

14:20.978 --> 14:23.346
See, this
pocket of mine,

14:23.347 --> 14:24.614
It acts like
a sealed container.

14:24.615 --> 14:26.349
Without it,

14:26.350 --> 14:28.984
Tte vessel would breach
in 20 minutes or so.

14:28.985 --> 14:31.052
Even with him inside there,
we got, uh,

14:31.053 --> 14:32.353
I don't know, six hours,
eight hours

14:32.354 --> 14:33.621
At the most

14:33.622 --> 14:35.422
Before I'm going to
have to

14:35.423 --> 14:36.556
Get it out of
there again.

14:36.557 --> 14:38.390
That's very reassuring.

14:38.391 --> 14:41.559
[chuckles]

14:41.560 --> 14:43.761
What do those guys
want with it, anyway?

14:43.762 --> 14:45.562
You kidding?

14:45.563 --> 14:46.896
This thing represents

14:46.897 --> 14:49.965
A virtually unlimited
source of energy.

14:50.967 --> 14:52.333
Makes weapons-grade
plutonium

14:52.334 --> 14:54.902
Look like lamp oil.

14:54.903 --> 14:56.771
The duke's
got this guy, uh...

14:56.772 --> 14:59.507
Ellison, a former cabal geek,

14:59.508 --> 15:02.409
Who figured out a way
to harness the energy

15:02.410 --> 15:03.543
And weaponize it.

15:03.544 --> 15:04.644
They were planning
on selling it

15:04.645 --> 15:06.846
To the highest
bidder.

15:06.847 --> 15:08.614
You should go.

15:08.615 --> 15:10.649
[groans in pain]

15:10.650 --> 15:11.717
Hey...

15:11.718 --> 15:12.751
You have a better shot

15:12.752 --> 15:13.818
At making it
to the sanctuary

15:13.819 --> 15:14.886
On your own.

15:14.887 --> 15:16.087
Yeah, and what?

15:16.088 --> 15:18.489
Just leave you here?

15:18.490 --> 15:20.590
Look, I don't want to be
responsible

15:20.591 --> 15:24.093
For that thing getting used
for some crazy weapon.

15:24.094 --> 15:25.561
Well, that's
very noble, kate,

15:25.562 --> 15:28.497
But there's got to be
50 guys out there by now.

15:28.498 --> 15:30.565
I wouldn't make it
out the front door.

15:31.901 --> 15:33.401
What are we going to do?

15:33.402 --> 15:35.335
I don't know.

15:35.336 --> 15:37.004
We'll wait until dark.

15:39.640 --> 15:41.107
You know, hopefully

15:41.108 --> 15:44.876
Things will have
cooled off by then.

15:44.877 --> 15:47.745
No pun intended.

15:52.984 --> 15:55.552
Name's zimmerman.

15:55.553 --> 15:56.886
What about
the others?

15:56.887 --> 16:00.890
The signal went dead
after we grabbed him.

16:00.891 --> 16:02.558
I know what you guys
are looking for.

16:02.559 --> 16:05.828
I can't help you.

16:07.797 --> 16:09.464
Come on...

16:09.465 --> 16:11.900
Don't sell
yourself short.

16:11.901 --> 16:14.769
Everyone out there
is looking for jimmy,

16:14.770 --> 16:16.237
And the first one
to find him,

16:16.238 --> 16:20.840
Well, they're going to
have a big advantage.

16:20.841 --> 16:25.411
That's why I need you.

16:25.412 --> 16:29.681
You're my
insurance policy.

16:29.682 --> 16:30.916
Put him in the room.

16:38.123 --> 16:39.724
Put more men
on the street

16:39.725 --> 16:41.659
And widen the net.

16:48.733 --> 16:49.799
There.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.767
The com system's clean.

16:51.768 --> 16:52.799
Magnus?

16:52.800 --> 16:54.566
Any word on will?

16:54.567 --> 16:55.767
We tried to
track his cell,

16:55.768 --> 16:57.735
But they must have
ditched it.

16:57.736 --> 16:58.903
What are we
going to do?

16:58.904 --> 17:00.070
Well, we have
no choice

17:00.071 --> 17:01.037
But to continue
looking for james.

17:01.038 --> 17:02.138
[barks in protest]

17:02.139 --> 17:03.672
We have no leverage
at the moment,

17:03.673 --> 17:04.939
Which is why we need
to find him

17:04.940 --> 17:06.741
Before they do.

17:06.742 --> 17:07.742
Besides, the canister
he's carrying

17:07.742 --> 17:09.845
Has to come out soon or...

17:10.981 --> 17:12.815
Of course.

17:12.816 --> 17:14.184
Henry, thermographic
scanners.

17:14.185 --> 17:16.219
We use them
to detect the canister.

17:16.220 --> 17:17.619
I thought his pouch
was shielded

17:17.621 --> 17:18.753
To prevent
that kind of detection.

17:18.755 --> 17:20.989
It is, but after
prolonged exposure,

17:20.990 --> 17:22.624
Even a sealed chamber
succumbs to the effects

17:22.625 --> 17:24.224
Of radiant heat.

17:24.226 --> 17:25.760
See if you can calibrate
our scanners to pick it up.

17:25.761 --> 17:27.528
Yeah, all right,
I'm on it.

17:27.529 --> 17:28.762
See you at the van
in five?

17:28.763 --> 17:29.963
Actually,
you go ahead.

17:29.964 --> 17:31.565
Why? What are you
going to do?

17:31.566 --> 17:33.100
Stall.

17:42.142 --> 17:44.743
Hey...

17:44.744 --> 17:46.511
Come on.

17:46.512 --> 17:48.146
None of that.

17:48.147 --> 17:49.815
Here.

17:49.816 --> 17:51.950
This will perk you up.

18:08.832 --> 18:10.532
So, cubs or sox?

18:11.934 --> 18:13.168
Really?

18:13.169 --> 18:14.936
This is what we're
going to talk about?

18:14.937 --> 18:16.470
Hey, no matter
how tough things get,

18:16.471 --> 18:18.639
There is always time
for baseball.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.241
Come on, cubs or sox?

18:21.242 --> 18:23.009
If I wanted to  ee
fat guys running around,

18:23.010 --> 18:25.544
I'd watch reality tv.

18:25.545 --> 18:26.845
Wow...

18:26.846 --> 18:28.613
And you say
you're from chicago.

18:28.614 --> 18:29.881
Next you'll be
telling me

18:29.882 --> 18:33.784
You don't
like pizza.

18:33.785 --> 18:37.686
My dad was a cubs fan.

18:37.687 --> 18:41.989
So I guess
that makes me one too.

18:41.990 --> 18:44.725
Yeah...

18:44.726 --> 18:46.493
See, I knew I should have
left that bullet in.

18:46.494 --> 18:47.994
[laughs]

18:47.995 --> 18:51.063
Ow.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.099
I take it you're a sox fan?

18:54.100 --> 18:55.267
Oh, yeah.

18:55.268 --> 18:56.568
Yeah.

18:56.569 --> 18:59.972
My dad used to take me
to the games on sundays.

18:59.973 --> 19:02.574
He died when I was 12.

19:04.610 --> 19:06.044
Mine died when I was eight.

19:07.913 --> 19:09.881
No kidding?
What happened?

19:11.149 --> 19:12.649
[scoffs]

19:12.650 --> 19:14.117
Who are you, dr. Phil?

19:14.118 --> 19:15.818
He died, okay?

19:17.187 --> 19:18.954
Okay, I was just,
you know...

19:18.955 --> 19:21.623
This stuff tastes like crap.

19:22.859 --> 19:23.925
[sighs heavily]

19:28.730 --> 19:29.831
We're shut out

19:29.832 --> 19:31.232
Of sanctuary
communications.

19:31.233 --> 19:33.267
What happened?

19:33.268 --> 19:35.036
They neutralized
the initial hack

19:35.037 --> 19:36.103
As expected.

19:36.104 --> 19:37.705
What about the back-up plan?

19:37.706 --> 19:39.139
Still in play.

19:39.140 --> 19:40.708
Good.

19:40.709 --> 19:42.576
[cell phone rings]

19:42.577 --> 19:45.212
Who the hell is this?

19:47.748 --> 19:49.916
<i>Let me make one thing
perfectly clear.</i>

19:49.917 --> 19:51.951
<i>If you have touched
so much as one hair</i>

19:51.952 --> 19:53.786
On will zimmerman's head,

19:53.787 --> 19:55.254
There is not enough real estate
on this earth

19:55.255 --> 19:56.321
To keep you safe from me.

19:57.957 --> 19:59.324
Dr. Magnus.

19:59.325 --> 20:01.159
That's awfully tough talk

20:01.160 --> 20:02.227
For someone
in your position.

20:02.228 --> 20:03.228
<i>Is it?</i>

20:03.229 --> 20:05.129
I guess you haven't heard.

20:05.130 --> 20:06.130
<i>Heard what?</i>

20:06.131 --> 20:07.130
I have jimmy.

20:09.299 --> 20:10.599
You're lying.

20:10.600 --> 20:11.767
<i>My team just picked him up
moments ago.</i>

20:11.768 --> 20:13.668
They're on their way back here
as we speak.

20:13.669 --> 20:15.069
<i>They have cell phones,
don't they?</i>

20:15.070 --> 20:17.638
Put him on the phone.
Let me talk to him.

20:17.639 --> 20:18.606
<i>He's been injured.</i>

20:18.607 --> 20:19.907
<i>He's in no condition
to talk.</i>

20:19.908 --> 20:22.008
<i>I will call you
once he's stable.</i>

20:22.009 --> 20:23.643
<i>Until then,</i>

20:23.644 --> 20:25.611
Get your men off my streets

20:25.612 --> 20:28.312
And keep your hands
off my people.

20:34.016 --> 20:36.017
Do you think she's
telling the truth?

20:36.018 --> 20:38.252
Find out.

20:43.824 --> 20:45.056
[groans softly]

20:47.225 --> 20:48.626
Is this thing going to work?

20:48.627 --> 20:50.862
Absolutely.

20:50.863 --> 20:53.063
Detecting the heat
signature's easy.

20:53.064 --> 20:54.964
Problem is the range,

20:54.965 --> 20:58.065
Because we've got to be
within 35 feet.

20:58.066 --> 20:59.867
35 feet?

20:59.868 --> 21:01.268
You know I never
have enough time

21:01.269 --> 21:03.770
With these things.

21:03.771 --> 21:05.639
I guess I'll be
walking, then.

21:05.640 --> 21:06.639
It's good
for the heart.

21:06.640 --> 21:07.807
Yeah.
[grumbles]

21:07.808 --> 21:09.108
I'll go this way.

21:09.109 --> 21:10.242
Stay sharp.

21:17.147 --> 21:19.014
So who was she?

21:19.015 --> 21:20.246
What?

21:20.247 --> 21:21.280
Only one reason

21:21.281 --> 21:22.915
To get a tattoo removed.

21:22.916 --> 21:25.884
That, or you found out
the chinese character you
picked

21:25.885 --> 21:27.085
Means "stupid white guy."

21:27.086 --> 21:28.620
Ha ha.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.922
Ha ha.

21:30.923 --> 21:35.225
Yeah...

21:35.226 --> 21:36.693
Yeah, I used to run
with some guys

21:36.694 --> 21:37.927
Back in the day.

21:37.928 --> 21:40.896
The kingtown gang.

21:40.897 --> 21:42.131
You ever hear of them?

21:42.132 --> 21:44.099
Sounds familiar.

21:44.100 --> 21:45.800
Yeah, I fell in
with them

21:45.801 --> 21:47.267
When I was 16,

21:47.268 --> 21:48.368
After my dad died.

21:48.369 --> 21:50.036
Took me years
to find my way out.

21:50.037 --> 21:52.871
I know the feeling.

21:52.872 --> 21:54.339
Yeah, see, I was
an easy target

21:54.340 --> 21:57.775
Because of old
mr. Happy here.

21:57.776 --> 22:00.177
You know, started out
innocent enough--

22:00.178 --> 22:03.346
Drugs across the border,
stuff like that,

22:03.347 --> 22:05.681
And then someone
needed a gun

22:05.682 --> 22:06.915
For a robbery,

22:06.916 --> 22:08.049
And then someone
needed a gun

22:08.050 --> 22:10.318
For a murder...

22:10.319 --> 22:12.286
Yeah, pretty soon
I was carrying

22:12.287 --> 22:15.789
Just about anything
that fit in there.

22:15.790 --> 22:18.825
I did some things
I'm not proud of.

22:20.761 --> 22:22.394
When'd you get out?

22:22.395 --> 22:24.997
10 years ago.

22:24.998 --> 22:28.300
They got me to make a drop
on the el

22:28.301 --> 22:29.434
At rush hour.

22:29.435 --> 22:30.969
A peridax.

22:30.970 --> 22:32.070
You know
what that is?

22:32.071 --> 22:33.138
No.

22:33.139 --> 22:34.272
It's this cute
little thing.

22:34.273 --> 22:35.373
It's kind of
a cross

22:35.374 --> 22:36.842
Between a guinea pig
and a koala,

22:36.843 --> 22:38.243
But anyway, um...

22:38.244 --> 22:39.444
They said it was
to create a diversion

22:39.445 --> 22:40.745
For a robbery
they're pulling.

22:40.746 --> 22:41.813
Okay, fine,

22:41.814 --> 22:42.947
So I'm, uh...

22:42.948 --> 22:44.315
I'm on the platform
at lake station,

22:44.316 --> 22:46.183
I'm waiting for
the red line, and...

22:47.919 --> 22:50.286
And this woman comes up to me.

22:50.287 --> 22:52.288
Dr. Magnus.

22:52.289 --> 22:54.890
Yeah...

22:54.891 --> 22:56.992
And somehow she knew
everything about me.

22:56.993 --> 22:59.026
Who I was,
what I was about to do,

22:59.027 --> 23:02.762
And she tells me
the gang lied.

23:02.763 --> 23:05.698
That, uh...

23:05.699 --> 23:07.299
That when a peridax gets
scared,

23:07.300 --> 23:09.400
It releases a spray
like a skunk,

23:09.401 --> 23:11.836
Just...

23:11.837 --> 23:17.107
Uh, really toxic
in close quarters, you know?

23:17.108 --> 23:19.309
I mean, I was that close
to killing...

23:19.310 --> 23:22.178
Hundreds of people.

23:23.847 --> 23:25.247
She stopped me.

23:31.786 --> 23:34.086
[chuckles wryly]

23:34.087 --> 23:35.320
What?

23:36.823 --> 23:39.223
Nothing.

23:39.224 --> 23:43.293
Sorry. I...

23:43.294 --> 23:45.361
You just, uh...

23:45.362 --> 23:47.997
You look really familiar.

23:56.904 --> 23:58.070
[beeps an alert]

24:15.387 --> 24:17.888
Sorry...

24:17.889 --> 24:19.255
Enjoy your meal.

24:27.964 --> 24:28.699
<i>Tell the duke</i>

24:28.700 --> 24:29.535
<i>Magnus' people are still
out here</i>

24:29.536 --> 24:31.803
<i>Looking for something.</i>

24:46.082 --> 24:48.216
I think your boss
is lying to me...

24:51.054 --> 24:53.824
Which is very, very bad news

24:53.825 --> 24:55.960
For you.

25:05.380 --> 25:06.714
What are you doing?

25:08.650 --> 25:12.119
Ingenious, aren't they?

25:12.120 --> 25:16.157
Built by my second-in-command,
ellison.

25:16.158 --> 25:18.759
Without 'em,
I'm nothing but an animal,

25:18.760 --> 25:21.462
But at half power,

25:21.463 --> 25:26.367
I find it to be a very
effective
interrogation tool.

25:26.368 --> 25:28.069
Okay, just
hold on a second.

25:28.070 --> 25:29.304
[breathing heavily]

25:29.305 --> 25:32.373
This is a very
bad idea.

25:32.374 --> 25:34.441
I disagree.

25:35.644 --> 25:38.479
[choking and gasping]

25:40.515 --> 25:43.250
Where the hell is jimmy?

25:45.786 --> 25:47.386
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey,

25:47.387 --> 25:49.389
Come on, come on...

25:49.390 --> 25:51.359
Don't try
to get up.

25:51.360 --> 25:52.727
[gasping in pain]

25:52.728 --> 25:54.395
Seriously.

25:54.396 --> 25:55.896
If you die,

25:55.897 --> 25:57.397
No one's going to believe
that I saved you.

25:57.398 --> 25:58.632
I can't
stand this.

25:58.633 --> 26:00.934
I need to do something.
We're sitting ducks.

26:00.935 --> 26:02.302
Just relax.

26:02.303 --> 26:04.270
It'll be dark in a few hours,
and we'll move then.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.341
So why'd you leave chicago?

26:09.342 --> 26:11.309
Nothing to tell.
I left, end of story.

26:11.310 --> 26:13.577
Oh, come on,
I had my show and tell.

26:13.578 --> 26:14.813
I think it's your turn.

26:16.884 --> 26:18.251
You know I'm just
going to be annoying

26:18.252 --> 26:19.719
And keep asking,
right?

26:23.788 --> 26:26.360
I left after my father died.

26:26.361 --> 26:29.596
He was a lock-pick.

26:29.597 --> 26:31.831
Could crack a safe
in four minutes flat.

26:34.200 --> 26:35.700
He, uh...

26:35.701 --> 26:37.201
Was hired to pull
a bank job

26:37.202 --> 26:38.835
By a group
of heavy-hitters,

26:38.836 --> 26:40.303
And they were impressed,

26:40.304 --> 26:42.371
And pretty soon
he was running with them.

26:42.372 --> 26:45.807
Sound familiar?

26:45.808 --> 26:49.343
What happened?

26:49.344 --> 26:51.111
He was pinched.

26:51.112 --> 26:55.680
When I was eight.

26:55.681 --> 26:57.782
I remember because my mom
was pregnant at the time.

27:00.352 --> 27:02.386
<i>We were on our way
to post bail.</i>

27:12.794 --> 27:16.423
He died...

27:16.424 --> 27:19.255
Along with a dozen policemen

27:19.256 --> 27:20.688
And three civilians.

27:23.688 --> 27:26.121
The shock sent
my mom into labor.

27:26.122 --> 27:30.392
We nearly lost
my brother too.

27:34.196 --> 27:37.164
We left chicago
a few years later.

27:37.165 --> 27:38.698
Moved around

27:38.699 --> 27:41.701
Until my mom decided
to go back to mumbai.

27:43.604 --> 27:47.406
I headed to montreal.

27:47.407 --> 27:49.207
That's quite a story.

27:56.247 --> 27:58.581
What's wrong?

27:58.582 --> 27:59.616
What?

27:59.617 --> 28:01.651
I'm just, uh,
looking out the window.

28:03.487 --> 28:05.688
You're acting all fidgety.

28:05.689 --> 28:07.422
No, it's the elemental.

28:07.423 --> 28:10.224
It's making me uncomfortable.

28:12.927 --> 28:14.928
[clicking gun distractedly]

28:17.965 --> 28:19.599
[rattles taps and sink]

28:33.612 --> 28:35.879
What the...

28:39.452 --> 28:40.653
[cell phone rings]

28:40.654 --> 28:42.189
What is it?

28:42.190 --> 28:43.591
Are you doing anything major
with the system right now?

28:43.592 --> 28:45.626
No. Why?

28:45.627 --> 28:47.226
<i>Something's wrong.
It's moving too slow.</i>

28:47.227 --> 28:48.792
Oh, man.

28:48.793 --> 28:49.860
Oh, no, no, no!

28:49.861 --> 28:51.894
I don't believe this.

28:51.895 --> 28:53.396
<i>What?</i>

28:53.397 --> 28:55.431
They embedded a sleeper worm
that could only be activated

28:55.432 --> 28:57.600
In the event I re-encrypted
the com frequencies.

28:57.601 --> 28:59.568
They knew that we would
discover the first virus.

28:59.569 --> 29:00.635
They had a back-up plan
in place.

29:00.636 --> 29:01.903
Wait a minute.

29:01.904 --> 29:02.870
They're monitoring
our system right now?

29:02.871 --> 29:03.904
<i>Yeah.</i>

29:03.905 --> 29:05.105
Yeah, I'm on my way.

29:05.106 --> 29:05.872
I'll take care of it
when I get back.

29:05.873 --> 29:07.540
Uh, no.

29:07.541 --> 29:08.907
No?

29:08.908 --> 29:11.876
If they're so interested
in what we're up to,

29:11.877 --> 29:14.778
I say let them see.

29:14.779 --> 29:16.279
[yelping in pain]

29:16.280 --> 29:18.614
Where did freelander
take him?

29:18.615 --> 29:21.248
How would magnus
get in touch with them?

29:21.249 --> 29:22.750
[gasping]

29:22.751 --> 29:23.883
I don't know anything.

29:23.884 --> 29:25.551
Then you're no good to me.

29:25.552 --> 29:26.619
[dialing down power]

29:26.620 --> 29:27.952
No...

29:27.953 --> 29:29.386
No, don't do this.

29:29.387 --> 29:32.288
[sighs and gasps]

29:33.323 --> 29:34.823
[choking]

29:34.824 --> 29:36.425
[roars in rage]

29:38.761 --> 29:39.594
Duke!

29:39.595 --> 29:40.794
[activates devices]

29:40.795 --> 29:41.862
[roars]

29:43.765 --> 29:45.398
[gasps, wincing]

29:45.399 --> 29:47.665
Why did you do that?

29:47.666 --> 29:48.932
We just got confirmation.

29:48.933 --> 29:50.733
The sanctuary does have jimmy.

29:50.734 --> 29:52.767
What?

29:52.768 --> 29:57.304
We were able to access
their intake files.

29:57.305 --> 29:58.538
Jimmy's there.

29:58.539 --> 30:01.039
Injured,

30:01.040 --> 30:02.607
Just like she said.

30:06.444 --> 30:07.477
[beeping]

30:09.680 --> 30:11.481
It's the duke.

30:11.482 --> 30:12.348
You think
he bought it?

30:12.349 --> 30:14.583
Let's hope so.

30:16.686 --> 30:18.519
I thought I told you
to wait for my call.

30:18.520 --> 30:19.887
<i>I've waited
long enough.</i>

30:19.888 --> 30:24.425
<i>Besides, your friend
isn't doing too good.</i>

30:26.461 --> 30:30.430
<i>I've transmitted
my location.</i>

30:30.431 --> 30:32.765
<i>If you have jimmy
like you say you do,</i>

30:32.766 --> 30:35.334
<i>You have 30 minutes
to deliver him to me,</i>

30:35.335 --> 30:37.837
<i>Otherwise...</i>

30:37.838 --> 30:40.606
<i>Pretty boy dies.</i>

30:46.048 --> 30:47.582
What the hell
are we going to do?

30:47.583 --> 30:49.950
Did you notice that device
he was wearing on his temple?

30:49.951 --> 30:51.118
Yeah, what was that?

30:51.219 --> 30:52.152
It looked like some
sort of electrode.

30:52.153 --> 30:53.153
Okay...

30:53.154 --> 30:55.054
So he's a diukon, remember?

30:55.055 --> 30:56.955
Oh, you think that's
what's suppressing his anger?

30:56.956 --> 30:58.290
It makes sense.

30:58.291 --> 31:00.124
A device that taps directly
into the limbic system

31:00.125 --> 31:01.459
Would have the desired effect

31:01.460 --> 31:02.960
Of keeping his aggression
in check.

31:02.961 --> 31:05.162
All right, that's all great,
but how does that help us?

31:05.163 --> 31:07.664
Diukons' brain chemistry
is vastly different

31:07.665 --> 31:09.065
Than that of a human.

31:09.066 --> 31:11.434
If indeed his rage center
has been suppressed,

31:11.435 --> 31:12.868
It's likely
that other parts of his brain

31:12.869 --> 31:14.170
Are open to manipulation.

31:14.171 --> 31:15.604
What other parts?

31:15.605 --> 31:18.472
The visual cortex,
for one.

31:18.473 --> 31:20.540
Come on, I have an idea.

31:20.541 --> 31:22.008
What was the name

31:22.009 --> 31:23.877
Of the gang
you ran with?

31:23.878 --> 31:25.111
Kingtown?

31:25.112 --> 31:26.545
Yeah.

31:26.546 --> 31:28.813
I think I remember
where I heard of them.

31:28.814 --> 31:29.914
Yeah, that's
good for you.

31:29.915 --> 31:33.484
Guy by the name
of ernesto ripelli

31:33.485 --> 31:34.885
Used to
run with them.

31:34.886 --> 31:36.153
They charged him

31:36.154 --> 31:38.655
With the bombing
that killed my father.

31:38.656 --> 31:41.557
That was before my time.

31:41.558 --> 31:43.058
He got off

31:43.059 --> 31:44.227
Because they uldn't explain

31:44.228 --> 31:46.096
How he got past
the metal detectors.

31:49.733 --> 31:51.033
That's what made
the explosion

31:51.034 --> 31:52.801
So shocking.

31:52.802 --> 31:55.070
No one had any idea

31:55.071 --> 31:56.504
How that bomb
was planted.

32:19.990 --> 32:21.991
It was you, wasn't it?

32:30.697 --> 32:32.697
[barking excitedly]

32:55.652 --> 32:57.553
[barks excitedly]

33:02.725 --> 33:03.892
Kate, you got to understand.

33:03.893 --> 33:05.260
It was my first big job.

33:08.665 --> 33:11.533
<i>I didn't think
I had a choice.</i>

33:11.534 --> 33:12.768
<i>You know how it works.</i>

33:12.769 --> 33:14.336
<i>Once you're in...
You're in.</i>

33:14.337 --> 33:17.038
[pocket squelches wetly]

33:20.742 --> 33:23.309
[activation beep]

33:29.581 --> 33:31.215
So that's it?

33:31.216 --> 33:32.884
That's all you've got to say?

33:40.291 --> 33:43.125
I can't change what I've done.

33:45.028 --> 33:46.261
So my dad was just
in the wrong place

33:46.262 --> 33:47.329
At the wrong time.

33:47.330 --> 33:49.364
Is that it?

33:49.365 --> 33:50.866
Kate, what are you
talking about?

33:50.867 --> 33:53.634
Your dad was the target.

33:56.104 --> 33:57.604
He was trying to cut a deal
with the d.A.

33:57.605 --> 33:59.606
That's why the gang
wanted him killed.

34:03.811 --> 34:04.810
Shut up!

34:04.811 --> 34:05.912
Shut up!

34:05.913 --> 34:06.912
You're lying!

34:06.913 --> 34:08.146
I don't want to be

34:08.147 --> 34:09.213
The bearer
of bad news here,

34:09.214 --> 34:10.014
But your dad was
turning on the guys

34:10.014 --> 34:11.081
He was running with.

34:11.081 --> 34:12.447
He knew the risks.

34:12.449 --> 34:15.784
Well, it doesn't change
the fact that he's dead.

34:17.719 --> 34:19.054
No, it doesn't.

34:20.255 --> 34:22.623
Get down.

34:22.623 --> 34:24.090
Get down on your knees.

34:34.699 --> 34:37.034
Anything else you want to say?

34:38.705 --> 34:40.871
Just that I don't blame you.

34:46.078 --> 34:48.946
And go, white sox.

34:53.684 --> 34:54.884
[barking and roaring]

34:57.820 --> 35:00.922
Kate?

35:00.923 --> 35:01.990
James...

35:01.991 --> 35:03.291
We have to go.

35:03.292 --> 35:05.059
Not now.

35:06.027 --> 35:07.828
Magnus needs our help.

35:21.707 --> 35:23.874
Where's jimmy?

35:23.875 --> 35:26.910
I wanted to make certain
will was still alive.

35:26.911 --> 35:28.312
Now you are.

35:28.313 --> 35:29.913
Where's jimmy?

35:29.914 --> 35:32.282
I don't take kindly
to strangers coming into my
town

35:32.283 --> 35:34.149
Making bull-headed demands.

35:34.150 --> 35:35.350
You'll get james

35:35.351 --> 35:36.785
Once you've released will.

35:38.020 --> 35:39.087
You've got
me now.

35:39.088 --> 35:40.922
You don't need both of us.

35:40.923 --> 35:42.123
Magnus--

35:42.124 --> 35:44.024
This is not
a negotiation.

35:44.025 --> 35:46.093
I was prepared
to cut you some slack

35:46.094 --> 35:48.828
Because of
your considerable reputation,

35:48.829 --> 35:51.030
But now you're just
trying my patience.

35:52.466 --> 35:54.133
So one
last time--

35:54.134 --> 35:56.401
Where's jimmy?

35:59.305 --> 36:01.305
Fair enough.

36:01.306 --> 36:02.306
Easy.

36:02.307 --> 36:05.275
Easy!

36:05.276 --> 36:06.843
[will]: Magnus,
don't do it!

36:12.149 --> 36:13.951
Jimmy...

36:13.952 --> 36:15.118
Well, now,
you've given me some grief

36:15.119 --> 36:16.253
Over the last few days,

36:16.254 --> 36:17.754
Now, haven't you?

36:23.692 --> 36:24.958
Are we square?

36:24.959 --> 36:26.192
Yeah.

36:26.193 --> 36:27.260
Yeah, get
out of here.

36:29.296 --> 36:30.362
Boss,
what're you--

36:30.363 --> 36:31.696
Let him go.

36:38.236 --> 36:40.304
Come on.

36:40.305 --> 36:42.105
Let me see
the container.

36:42.106 --> 36:43.740
Since when
did you turn

36:43.741 --> 36:44.841
Into david blaine?

36:44.842 --> 36:46.776
Just keep moving.

37:01.857 --> 37:03.090
It's working, sally.

37:03.091 --> 37:04.324
Keep concentrating.

37:04.325 --> 37:06.392
What the hell
is wrong with you?

37:06.393 --> 37:08.127
I said,
let me see it.

37:08.128 --> 37:09.294
Duke, there's
no one there.

37:09.295 --> 37:10.423
Who you
talking to?

37:10.424 --> 37:11.958
Let me see the container.

37:11.959 --> 37:12.992
Now!

37:16.863 --> 37:17.963
No!

37:17.964 --> 37:19.064
Stop them!

37:19.065 --> 37:20.532
[gunshots ricochet]

37:25.737 --> 37:27.937
I suppose
that was your idea of a joke!

37:27.938 --> 37:30.139
[tires squealing]

37:34.944 --> 37:36.210
Stop!

37:36.211 --> 37:37.178
You're looking
for me?

37:45.281 --> 37:46.548
Jimmy.

37:46.549 --> 37:48.284
Duke.

37:48.285 --> 37:49.388
Let them go.

37:50.825 --> 37:52.058
I'll come quietly,

37:52.159 --> 37:54.060
But you've got to
release them first.

37:54.061 --> 37:57.563
How do I know
you have the container?

37:57.564 --> 38:00.732
Why don't you reach in
and see for yourself?

38:07.839 --> 38:08.939
Okay.

38:12.777 --> 38:15.545
Well, it looks like
we have a deal after all.

38:15.546 --> 38:16.913
James, you don't
have to do this.

38:16.914 --> 38:19.781
Yes, I do.

38:20.817 --> 38:21.816
I'm sorry.

38:24.787 --> 38:26.954
It's all
I can say.

38:28.889 --> 38:32.024
You go. Hurry.

38:32.025 --> 38:33.125
All right, come on,
come on, get in the car.

38:38.663 --> 38:40.029
Tell the others
we'll meet 'em in chicago.

38:56.543 --> 38:59.045
[sighs heavily]

38:59.046 --> 39:00.546
Jimmy...

39:00.547 --> 39:01.914
Duke.

39:01.915 --> 39:04.182
Glad you finally
came to your senses.

39:04.183 --> 39:05.450
Me too.

39:05.451 --> 39:08.686
Let's see the goods.

39:08.687 --> 39:11.622
Sure.

39:16.127 --> 39:18.994
What's this
doing here?

39:18.995 --> 39:21.930
I don't know.

39:24.433 --> 39:25.533
Oh, no.

39:25.534 --> 39:28.235
Here you go.

39:58.463 --> 40:00.597
I admit, it was
a calculated risk.

40:00.598 --> 40:01.866
That's what
you call it?

40:01.867 --> 40:03.500
I mean, did you even know
it was going to work?

40:03.501 --> 40:04.768
Not positively, no,

40:04.769 --> 40:05.902
But I was
fairly certain

40:05.903 --> 40:07.002
That if henry
were able to boost

40:07.003 --> 40:08.336
Sally's
telepathic signal,

40:08.337 --> 40:09.337
She could tap
directly into

40:09.338 --> 40:10.604
The duke's
visual cortex.

40:10.605 --> 40:11.739
And see something
that wasn't really there.

40:11.740 --> 40:12.839
Exactly.

40:12.840 --> 40:13.840
That's why
I'm glad we had

40:13.841 --> 40:14.941
A fairly recent
photo of james

40:14.942 --> 40:16.008
For her to focus on.

40:16.009 --> 40:17.109
Yeah, about james...

40:17.110 --> 40:18.210
I'm sorry.

40:18.211 --> 40:21.112
He did what he felt
he had to do.

40:21.113 --> 40:23.214
He'd been living with the guilt
for so many years,

40:23.215 --> 40:24.584
I suspect it was a relief.

40:24.585 --> 40:26.586
Yeah.

40:26.587 --> 40:28.388
Well, I'm off to see sally.

40:28.389 --> 40:29.723
Hey, what kind of thank-you
gift
do you get for a mermaid?

40:29.724 --> 40:31.491
She really likes it
if you swim with her.

40:31.492 --> 40:33.592
Huh... I'll get my suit.

40:33.593 --> 40:34.660
No suit.

40:42.101 --> 40:43.834
[gentle knock on door]

40:45.770 --> 40:46.970
May I come in?

40:46.971 --> 40:48.670
Yeah.

40:50.572 --> 40:52.907
How's the shoulder?

40:52.908 --> 40:55.112
Looks like
my tennis days are over.

40:57.681 --> 40:59.649
I wanted you to know
that I had no idea

40:59.650 --> 41:01.150
About your family's
prior history

41:01.151 --> 41:02.384
With james,

41:02.385 --> 41:03.619
Otherwise
I would--

41:03.620 --> 41:05.053
Never would have put me
in that position.

41:06.789 --> 41:08.522
I know. It's okay.

41:08.523 --> 41:12.591
Actually, it's not.

41:12.592 --> 41:13.993
I run a very thorough
background check

41:13.994 --> 41:15.194
On everyone I work with,

41:15.195 --> 41:17.696
And somehow
I missed this.

41:17.697 --> 41:18.830
I'm sorry.

41:18.831 --> 41:19.897
Well, it's not
the kind of thing

41:19.898 --> 41:21.632
You put
at the top of your resume.

41:21.633 --> 41:24.701
Well, I appreciate
your understanding.

41:24.702 --> 41:27.704
I'm not sure I'd be as
forgiving if I were in your
position.

41:32.042 --> 41:35.944
It's funny.

41:35.945 --> 41:37.245
I always wondered
what I would do

41:37.246 --> 41:39.247
If I ever figured out
who killed my father.

41:41.750 --> 41:43.950
Turns out it's not
as black and white as I
thought.

41:45.153 --> 41:46.686
Life rarely is.

41:46.687 --> 41:50.356
I could have been jimmy.

41:50.357 --> 41:53.958
I've done things
I'm not proud of.

41:53.959 --> 41:55.259
How areewe so different?

42:00.932 --> 42:04.334
I've been blaming
the way my life turned out

42:04.335 --> 42:09.671
On that one moment
20 years ago...

42:12.208 --> 42:15.243
But the truth is,

42:15.244 --> 42:17.244
I made my life the way it is.

42:17.245 --> 42:20.881
And your life
is still unfolding.

42:27.821 --> 42:29.588
I'll let you rest.
