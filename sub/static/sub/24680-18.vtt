00:02.565 --> 00:05.071
In New York City's war on crime,

00:05.071 --> 00:10.147
the worst criminal offenders are pursued
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

00:10.147 --> 00:11.985
These are their stories.

00:13.693 --> 00:15.763
I don't understand why you didn't follow up.

00:15.763 --> 00:18.409
The bleeding is symptomatic 
of everything you checked for.

00:18.409 --> 00:20.035
Eh, it's minor.

00:20.481 --> 00:22.964
And she's 13 years old.
It happens.

00:22.964 --> 00:26.821
If it's all the same to you,
I'm having her rechecked for C.E.M.

00:26.821 --> 00:28.281
Knock yourself out.

00:28.281 --> 00:31.270
I've only been doing this for 20 years.

00:33.538 --> 00:36.074
There's no way anybody knows.

00:36.074 --> 00:38.608
I'm just getting worked up over nothin'.

00:38.608 --> 00:40.644
You usually do.

00:40.793 --> 00:45.149
Hey, Paige, I'd like to think 
I'm not just doing this for me.

00:45.149 --> 00:47.456
It wasn't my idea.

00:50.190 --> 00:52.300
I spoke with him.
Everything is fine.

00:52.300 --> 00:53.997
Don't worry about it.

00:54.628 --> 00:58.408
Mom, we're gonna be late.
Can we motor, please?

01:04.723 --> 01:07.565
Molly said McClintock had
to use the whip this morning.

01:07.565 --> 01:10.152
That's happy news.

01:11.091 --> 01:14.573
Does Paige know how pretty Molly is?

01:16.386 --> 01:20.085
I wouldn't be surprised if he shows up with 
endorsements for teeth whiteners on his saddle.

01:20.085 --> 01:22.765
Lighten up, Megs.
He's putting some zing into the sport.

01:22.765 --> 01:27.116
Oh, really?  I could think of other 
sports in more desperate need of zing.

01:27.116 --> 01:29.644
Speak of the devil.
Hello, Neil.

01:29.644 --> 01:31.774
We werejust talking about  
your terrific streak.   /   Yes.

01:31.774 --> 01:34.967
I heard that you had trouble getting 
your horse over thejumps this morning.

01:34.967 --> 01:39.213
They're showoffs, Mrs. Townsend.
They'll be fine once there's a crowd.

01:39.963 --> 01:44.220
Excuse me.  /  Is that how you're planning 
on winning tomorrow? By getting us all sick?

01:44.824 --> 01:46.963
I have to take this.

01:47.432 --> 01:49.363
Good luck to us all tomorrow.

01:49.998 --> 01:51.479
Yeah.

01:52.360 --> 01:53.897
How bad?

01:54.673 --> 01:56.676
Give me 10 minutes.
I'll meet you out there.

01:56.676 --> 01:59.600
I'm sure we've met before.
Last summer in the Hamptons.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.539
I've never been to the Hamptons.

02:01.539 --> 02:03.085
No? Where do you summer?

02:03.085 --> 02:05.858
Same place I winter.
In Bedford.

02:05.858 --> 02:07.743
Ralph Lauren's Fourth ofJuly barbecue.

02:07.743 --> 02:09.009
You were playing tennis, right?

02:09.009 --> 02:11.537
That's, uh, how you keep this arm so well-toned.

02:11.537 --> 02:16.698
I keep it well-toned by sticking 
it up a cow's rectum once a day.

02:16.753 --> 02:19.524
I'm a vet, and I have patients to see tonight.

02:19.524 --> 02:24.906
My fault. I didn't realize the 
help was invited to this dinner.

02:30.223 --> 02:33.075
What happened? Oh, my God.!
What happened?

02:33.075 --> 02:35.179
What happened?

3x18. Ill-Bred

03:22.339 --> 03:25.068
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC:  2004/04/18

03:31.254 --> 03:34.384
Security found herjust after 1:00.
Name's Molly Simms.

03:34.384 --> 03:36.600
She's a veterinarian in Bedford.

03:36.600 --> 03:37.932
She's in town for the horse show.

03:37.932 --> 03:39.125
She came from the party?

03:39.125 --> 03:41.883
A dinner for the horse folks.

03:41.883 --> 03:43.986
She was doing a bed check on the clients' horses.

03:43.986 --> 03:46.972
- McClintock?
- No. Madison.

03:47.948 --> 03:50.721
Uh, what killed the horses?

03:50.721 --> 03:54.519
Three-inch nails through the skull.
Found a nail gun in the stall.

03:54.519 --> 03:56.789
I'll get Mr. McClintock.

03:57.841 --> 03:59.932
She came to check on the Madison horse...

03:59.932 --> 04:03.998
and found somebody pumping 
nails into these horses.

04:09.169 --> 04:12.125
Yeah, see the way her legs are tucked under?

04:12.125 --> 04:15.564
She came in,
she saw the injured horses.

04:15.564 --> 04:19.365
It would have been her instinct 
to kneel down to help them.

04:52.120 --> 04:54.628
Another lovely pearl.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.523
It must have fallen in when she was killed.

04:57.852 --> 05:00.989
The killer closed the bag.

05:00.989 --> 05:03.256
He didn't want us to know that...

05:03.256 --> 05:06.349
she started to help the horses,

05:07.399 --> 05:10.488
which she would have done 
if she didn't feel in danger.

05:10.488 --> 05:12.849
Because she knew the killer.

05:14.317 --> 05:18.902
This is Dr. McClintock and his groom, Roy Daniels.

05:21.112 --> 05:23.306
I just can't believe this.

05:23.306 --> 05:25.245
That poor woman.
It's terrible.

05:25.245 --> 05:27.685
We think she walked in on 
somebody killing your horses.

05:27.685 --> 05:31.044
You know any reason why 
somebody would want to hurt them?

05:31.044 --> 05:34.188
No. Who'd kill a horse,
especially these?

05:34.188 --> 05:36.698
- They were champion jumpers.
- Million-dollar horses.

05:36.698 --> 05:39.866
Million dollars.
What's your specialty, Doctor?

05:39.866 --> 05:42.107
I'm a dentist in Stamford.

05:42.107 --> 05:44.276
You were favored to win this weekend?

05:44.276 --> 05:47.909
Doc's won his last five competitions.
Doc was the man to beat.

05:47.909 --> 05:50.855
And these were the horses to beat.

05:50.978 --> 05:52.254
Is that your saddle?

05:52.254 --> 05:54.724
Yeah.
Fancy saddle.

05:54.724 --> 05:59.133
It's newer than the other ones here.
How long you been jumpin', Doc?

05:59.133 --> 06:01.219
In competition?
Six months.

06:01.219 --> 06:03.052
Five wins in six months.

06:03.052 --> 06:06.214
That must have put a burr 
under these other saddles.

06:06.214 --> 06:08.854
I'm not gonna point any fingers.

06:09.171 --> 06:10.791
Come on, Roy.

06:12.829 --> 06:16.808
You have this all wrong.
The world of show horses is like a big family.

06:16.808 --> 06:20.350
Dr. McClintock. 
This is who he was up against today?

06:20.350 --> 06:22.612
Yes, that was the order for the morning ride.

06:22.612 --> 06:25.735
Looks like they erased one of the names.

06:26.238 --> 06:29.019
You know, I see a "K" and...

06:30.280 --> 06:34.478
and an "O."
There's a "C."

06:34.914 --> 06:36.575
McClintock.

06:36.987 --> 06:38.661
You put him in the last position.

06:38.661 --> 06:42.460
He told me last night he was fighting the flu,
and he might have to scratch,

06:42.460 --> 06:45.123
so I moved him to give him 
extra time to get himself together.

06:45.123 --> 06:48.281
I see that he was well enough to practice yesterday.

06:48.281 --> 06:50.014
How'd he do?

06:51.781 --> 06:53.975
His horses were balking at the jumps.

06:53.975 --> 06:56.910
McClintock was using his whip liberally.

06:56.910 --> 06:59.852
Sounds like they caught his flu.

07:00.687 --> 07:02.808
This dried blood around
the nostrils of both horses...

07:02.808 --> 07:06.289
suggests a pulmonary hemorrhage 
brought on by overexertion.

07:06.289 --> 07:07.883
They were running the horses to death.

07:07.883 --> 07:09.796
That explain why they balked at the jumps?

07:09.796 --> 07:12.857
Yes. It also suggests they were being doped.

07:12.857 --> 07:17.149
I found nearly a dozen needle marks
just above the hooves of each horse.

07:17.149 --> 07:20.462
I tested each site and found traces 
of oxygen-enhancing performance drugs.

07:20.462 --> 07:23.691
But these horses were competing.
Don't they get tested for drugs?

07:23.691 --> 07:25.746
Yes, but...

07:26.098 --> 07:31.386
I detected high levels of furosemide in their blood.

07:31.386 --> 07:35.258
Furosemide causes a horse
to urinate at an elevated rate.

07:35.258 --> 07:38.676
Which flushes out whatever 
performance drug they were taking.

07:38.676 --> 07:41.244
Enough to pass the urine test.

07:42.316 --> 07:44.388
And these cuts on the lips?

07:44.388 --> 07:47.548
They're bite marks.
The horses were in distress.

07:47.548 --> 07:50.171
They could have easily injured each other.

07:50.885 --> 07:53.985
PIER 94
12TH AVENUE AT 55TH STREET
MONDAY, MARCH 22

07:53.985 --> 07:57.164
The horses weren'tjumping 
because they were barn sour.

07:57.164 --> 07:59.741
Horses are like little kids.
They're always acting up.

07:59.741 --> 08:02.563
And like little kids,
they get nosebleeds?

08:02.563 --> 08:05.390
Our vet says this is a symptom 
of pulmonary hemorrhage.

08:05.390 --> 08:06.450
And these needle marks...

08:06.450 --> 08:09.440
You want to know what she says about those?

08:09.955 --> 08:15.195
She told us that the horses were 
being doped up...and run to death.

08:15.430 --> 08:17.881
What do you think about that, Mr. Daniels?

08:17.881 --> 08:19.474
Nothing.

08:20.863 --> 08:23.559
What does Roy Stubbs think of it?

08:24.160 --> 08:25.963
That was your name, right...

08:25.963 --> 08:30.537
when the Florida Racing Commission 
banned you for doping horses?

08:30.537 --> 08:33.701
We got your fingerprints off 
McClintock's fancy saddle.

08:33.701 --> 08:37.025
The people in Florida...
They told us you were the best.

08:37.167 --> 08:40.389
That's why McClintock hired you, isn't it?

08:40.389 --> 08:41.442
Give him an edge.

08:41.442 --> 08:43.933
Doesn't matter now.
The horses are dead.

08:43.933 --> 08:46.583
Because that Friday night,
you put them out of their misery.

08:46.583 --> 08:49.143
Molly Simms walked in on ya.

08:49.294 --> 08:52.089
McClintock panicked. Not you.

08:52.089 --> 08:53.678
He killed her.

08:53.678 --> 08:57.478
And then he had you put the horses down with 
the nail gun to hide the real cause of death.

08:57.478 --> 09:00.268
That never happened.
We-We never saw that girl.

09:00.268 --> 09:02.422
And the horses were fine when we left.

09:02.422 --> 09:06.565
Fine? With bleeding nostrils and 
their lips cut from biting each other?

09:06.565 --> 09:09.346
- They were all riled up from the doping.
- You don't know what you're talking about.

09:09.346 --> 09:10.650
Those bite marks?

09:10.650 --> 09:14.137
They were from the horse in the next stall...
the Madison horse.

09:14.137 --> 09:16.413
That mare bit our horse Friday afternoon.

09:16.413 --> 09:20.978
And you're all crazy if you think we killed anybody.

09:22.790 --> 09:25.862
What do you do when one horse bites another?
What do you do to stop them?

09:25.862 --> 09:28.193
Nothing.
You just keep 'em apart.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.975
Is that what happened with the Madison horse?

09:29.975 --> 09:32.425
Yeah, they moved her Friday.

09:36.308 --> 09:38.569
Madison...
That was one of Molly's clients.

09:38.569 --> 09:41.535
Mmm, one of the horses 
on her list for the bed check.

09:42.778 --> 09:45.432
We're staying at the party too long.

09:45.432 --> 09:49.512
I gotta stay.
I got goals to meet.

09:49.512 --> 09:53.814
Yeah, but if you want me to stay,
you better make it worth my while.

09:53.938 --> 09:56.156
You know, Dale, 
I always took you for a weak character,

09:56.156 --> 09:57.689
but you've really impressed me.

09:57.689 --> 10:00.505
Marriage must have toughened you up.

10:03.972 --> 10:06.371
You know,
you should try that raisin pie.

10:06.371 --> 10:08.050
It's really good here.

10:12.624 --> 10:15.040
I moved the Madison horse here Friday.

10:15.040 --> 10:18.481
We always keep an empty 
stall in case we have a biter.

10:19.737 --> 10:21.464
Uh, thanks.

10:29.242 --> 10:31.222
These horses...

10:34.211 --> 10:36.262
You know, you got Crendall,

10:36.606 --> 10:41.736
Townsend, Sheppard, Lansing.
These were Molly's clients.

10:41.736 --> 10:44.154
So she came to check up on them.

10:44.154 --> 10:48.538
She didn't have any horses around 
the corner where McClintock's were.

10:48.538 --> 10:51.202
If the Madison horse was moved 
over here with her other clients,

10:51.202 --> 10:54.858
she didn't have any reason 
to be around the corner.

10:55.468 --> 11:00.653
Unless someone created a reason by calling 
for help... for McClintock's injured horses.

11:02.189 --> 11:06.358
Killing the horses was a 
cover for the real target.

11:06.902 --> 11:08.828
Molly.

11:12.280 --> 11:15.190
Anybody else she might have talked
to in the building? Another vet?

11:15.190 --> 11:17.406
No, Molly was our only vet.

11:17.406 --> 11:20.433
Anyway, she mostly worked out of her van.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.488
Local calls.

11:24.739 --> 11:26.880
Couple to the city.

11:26.880 --> 11:28.680
A few upstate to Newburgh.

11:28.680 --> 11:33.426
This is from a lab,
marked for a Saturday delivery.

11:33.817 --> 11:38.375
Is that common for a lab to 
pay extra for a rush delivery?

11:38.375 --> 11:41.170
No. Molly was expecting that.

11:41.170 --> 11:43.647
She told me to call her as soon as it came in.

11:43.647 --> 11:46.414
It's the results of blood work 
on a horse named Mariah.

11:46.414 --> 11:48.269
Maybe another doping case.

11:48.269 --> 11:50.123
Do you know how her filing system works?

11:50.123 --> 11:54.645
Uh, it's by species.
The drawer with the red tag is horses.

11:54.645 --> 11:58.104
Uh, it's filed by owner,
and then horse's name.

12:01.610 --> 12:05.534
Well, if she had a file on Mariah, it's missing.

12:07.167 --> 12:11.851
The city vet said these are the tests you'd 
run if the horse had internal bleeding.

12:11.851 --> 12:14.732
Lab have a way of tracking this horse? 
What about this number next to the horse's name?

12:14.732 --> 12:18.507
It was supplied by Molly Simms.
The lab doesn't know what it corresponds to.

12:18.507 --> 12:20.373
We got a name with no horse.

12:20.373 --> 12:22.949
Well, this horse had a job.

12:23.300 --> 12:26.179
Mariah was a carriage horse in Central Park.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.741
The number on the lab report...

12:28.741 --> 12:33.508
was issued by the Department of Health...
and burned into her hoof.

12:34.743 --> 12:36.852
She's a 13-year-old mare.

12:36.852 --> 12:40.818
She hauled tourists around 
Central Park until five years ago...

12:42.031 --> 12:44.292
when she was sold to a farm up in Wallkill.

12:44.292 --> 12:47.631
Wallkill? You know who her 
next-door neighbors are?

12:47.631 --> 12:51.980
The nice folks at Wallkill 
medium-security prison.

12:52.650 --> 12:55.295
FINDEL FARM
WALLKILL, NEW YORK
THURSDAY, MARCH 25

12:55.295 --> 12:57.094
You're saying Mariah isn't here?

12:57.094 --> 12:59.730
She was stolen last year.
She was a sweet-natured horse.

12:59.730 --> 13:02.944
She'd have walked off with anyone dangling a carrot.

13:03.152 --> 13:06.332
You know, I noticed, uh,

13:07.077 --> 13:09.918
some of these guys wearing interesting work clothes.

13:09.918 --> 13:11.086
They come from the prison?

13:11.086 --> 13:13.430
Yeah, it's a work release program.

13:13.430 --> 13:15.752
They get assigned a horse,
learn to take care of it.

13:15.752 --> 13:18.255
Who did Mariah get assigned to?

13:18.255 --> 13:20.367
A con named Rabbit Winters.

13:20.367 --> 13:24.735
He's still in Wallkill, doing time for, uh, burglary and drugs.

13:24.735 --> 13:26.837
Uh, careful.

13:27.016 --> 13:29.598
That's a quick-release knot.

13:29.598 --> 13:33.118
So Winters...
He get along well with Mariah?

13:33.118 --> 13:34.717
Oh, yes, he took good care ofher.

13:34.717 --> 13:37.077
Even fed her out ofhis own lunch box.

13:37.077 --> 13:40.069
Did you ever notice the horse having any kind of medical problems,

13:40.069 --> 13:44.274
like, um, internal bleeding?

13:44.274 --> 13:46.513
There were a couple of instances, but...

13:46.513 --> 13:48.752
it cleared up on its own.

13:49.935 --> 13:55.551
Now, did Winters have any reasons...
to take the horse into the prison gates?

13:55.551 --> 13:58.190
Sure, on visiting days,
so the kids could play with her.

13:58.190 --> 14:01.556
It's therapeutic for the cons and their families.

14:03.166 --> 14:06.855
I wouldn't say that nag brought me luck.
Bit me at least twice a week.

14:06.855 --> 14:10.250
I see your file says in the three years you took care of Mariah,

14:10.250 --> 14:13.155
you enjoyed special privileges in here.

14:13.155 --> 14:16.015
Your own TV,
extra time in the yard.

14:16.015 --> 14:20.922
And then when Mariah disappeared,
your luck turned bad.

14:20.922 --> 14:24.183
No more TV, no more privileges.

14:24.183 --> 14:25.836
That's life behind a wall.

14:25.836 --> 14:27.660
It's the horse.

14:27.660 --> 14:30.275
You know, Winters, the horse?

14:30.790 --> 14:33.270
Come on,
you stuffed it full of drugs,

14:33.270 --> 14:36.063
you walked it past the guards once a week.

14:36.063 --> 14:38.363
It made you the popular guy behind the wall.

14:38.363 --> 14:40.108
Until somebody stole her.

14:40.108 --> 14:41.468
I don't know what you're talking about.

14:41.468 --> 14:44.648
The somebody who procured the drugs 
and helped you load 'em into Mariah...

14:44.648 --> 14:46.232
That's who we want.

14:46.232 --> 14:47.798
I'm telling you.
It never happened.

14:47.798 --> 14:50.286
He trained the horse.
He took the biggest risks.

14:50.286 --> 14:53.938
And now his partner's transporting drugs,
maybe by trailer,

14:53.938 --> 14:55.907
down from Canada, up from Miami.

14:55.907 --> 14:57.783
He's making all the money.

14:57.783 --> 14:59.598
- Would that piss you off?
- That would piss me off.

14:59.598 --> 15:01.694
That would piss me off.
Would it piss you off?

15:01.694 --> 15:04.841
Not enough to make me turn snitch.

15:05.464 --> 15:07.248
Guard.

15:11.156 --> 15:14.392
If this mystery partner is moving horses 
up and down the eastern seaboard,

15:14.392 --> 15:16.721
it'll be tough to find him.

15:16.721 --> 15:19.433
Maybe we're setting our sights too low.

15:19.769 --> 15:22.022
The calls Molly made to Newburgh.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.884
Stewart International Airport.

15:24.922 --> 15:27.434
ANIMAL QUARANTINE CENTER
STEWART INT'L AIRPORT
NEWBURGH, NEW YOUK
MONDAY, MARCH 29

15:27.434 --> 15:32.723
I get a lot of calls from vets,
but I don't specifically remember a Dr. Simms.

15:32.723 --> 15:36.405
You have a better memory for animals?
A horse called Mariah?

15:37.538 --> 15:39.635
- No. Sorry.
- So how does it work?

15:39.635 --> 15:43.208
The horses fly in from overseas,
and then you examine them?

15:43.208 --> 15:46.464
Yeah, we quarantine them for a couple of weeks.

15:46.895 --> 15:50.867
So if there's anything wrong with them... 
internal bleeding...you catch it?

15:50.867 --> 15:52.882
Yes. It's not foolproof, but yes.

15:52.882 --> 15:55.179
That's probably why Dr. Simms called you.

15:55.179 --> 16:00.059
You see, she ordered up some lab 
tests for Mariah...for internal bleeding.

16:00.059 --> 16:01.905
But I never talked to her.

16:01.905 --> 16:05.160
Oh, that's a micro-frown.

16:05.543 --> 16:09.250
You know, the little, uh,
muscle between your eyes.

16:09.250 --> 16:12.544
You see, the face...
It constantly gives off micro-expressions.

16:12.544 --> 16:16.308
You know, little muscle twitches 
that reveal your true emotions.

16:16.308 --> 16:21.178
That was a micro-frown.
That's a tell for... lying.

16:21.916 --> 16:23.539
You're funny.

16:23.853 --> 16:27.072
He doesn't really think I'm funny 
'cause that wasn't a smile of enjoyment.

16:27.072 --> 16:30.425
If it were, then the muscle in the corner of your eye...

16:30.425 --> 16:33.496
it's called orbicularis oculi...
it would have raised up.

16:33.496 --> 16:36.910
That was an anxious smile.

16:37.712 --> 16:39.816
Read this expression.

16:39.816 --> 16:42.860
You're in a restricted federal facility...

16:42.860 --> 16:46.399
under the jurisdiction of Homeland Security.

16:46.399 --> 16:48.223
You have to leave.

16:48.223 --> 16:51.202
We'll expect those records by this afternoon.
If we don't like what we see,

16:51.202 --> 16:53.894
we'll be back with a subpoena.

16:57.092 --> 17:00.897
Easy, Mariah.
You're almost done, girl.

17:00.897 --> 17:03.016
Almost done.

17:03.398 --> 17:06.078
Dale, I want to show Dad my new saddle.

17:06.078 --> 17:08.469
The tack room's unlocked.

17:09.890 --> 17:13.411
Not as exciting as a baseball mitt,
but what the heck.

17:14.260 --> 17:17.102
Maybe that day will come,
Mr. Townsend.

17:17.102 --> 17:19.560
We're trying, Paige.
We'll see what happens.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.452
Dad, come on!

17:27.232 --> 17:29.326
All set?

17:29.767 --> 17:31.580
It's not right, Paige.

17:31.580 --> 17:33.506
Grow up.

17:39.341 --> 17:43.620
The animal quarantine center processed 
a horse named Mariah four weeks ago.

17:43.620 --> 17:46.830
She belongs to the Townsend Farm in Bedford.

17:46.830 --> 17:50.390
The horse was returning from a
show in Russia, in St. Petersburg.

17:50.390 --> 17:52.793
Townsend. That's one of Molly Simms's clients.

17:52.793 --> 17:55.820
And they had horses competing 
in the New York show last week.

17:55.820 --> 17:58.546
In the last 18 months,
Mariah and the other Townsend horses...

17:58.546 --> 18:02.743
have been in competition in Dubai, 
Ankara and Moscow.

18:02.743 --> 18:04.498
I'm seeing a common denominator.

18:04.498 --> 18:07.933
They're all entry points for 
Afghan heroin into the West.

18:07.933 --> 18:12.385
Someone traveling with the horses 
buys the heroin and puts it inside Mariah.

18:12.385 --> 18:16.039
Our vet thinks two to three kilos 
can fit inside Mariah's uterus.

18:16.039 --> 18:18.166
That's what caused the internal bleeding.

18:18.166 --> 18:19.808
The horses land here,

18:19.808 --> 18:21.996
and the drugs are removed during the quarantine.

18:21.996 --> 18:25.050
Probably by that vet, Reeves.

18:25.050 --> 18:27.481
Two to three kilos of uncut heroin each trip.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.631
That's a lot of easy money.

18:29.761 --> 18:32.913
It's nothing compared to the price Molly Simms paid.

18:36.258 --> 18:38.922
Mariah ran off last night.

18:38.922 --> 18:42.107
Somebody left the pasture gate open.

18:42.322 --> 18:45.973
If she gets into the woods and the coyotes get to her...

18:46.311 --> 18:49.488
You don't seem all that broken up, Mr. Mullen.

18:51.684 --> 18:55.357
Mariah was just a stable buddy,

18:55.357 --> 18:59.752
an easygoing horse to settle 
down these thoroughbreds.

18:59.752 --> 19:02.320
How 'bout long plane rides?

19:02.320 --> 19:05.065
She traveled with other horses?

19:05.387 --> 19:08.011
- That's right.
- You travel with them?

19:08.011 --> 19:13.164
Sure. Me and three handlers 
and Ms. Townsend.

19:13.164 --> 19:15.430
What is it that you do?
I'm sorry.

19:15.430 --> 19:20.828
I can't keep up with all this, 
uh, horse terminology.

19:20.828 --> 19:23.192
I'm the farm manager.

19:23.192 --> 19:27.319
So why aren't you on the farm 
managing rather than on a plane?

19:27.636 --> 19:30.753
I do what Mr. Townsend tells me.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.155
Oh!

19:33.155 --> 19:36.020
- Oh, that's a quick-release knot.
- Sorry. I just tugged on it.

19:36.020 --> 19:38.270
- I'll pick it up.
- That's all right. I'll get it.

19:39.777 --> 19:42.893
So you ever work as a groom...

19:43.133 --> 19:44.765
on the Findel Farm up in Wallkill?

19:44.765 --> 19:46.822
You're asking about the Findel Farm.

19:46.822 --> 19:48.908
My husband worked there just before I met him.

19:48.908 --> 19:50.969
Hi. I'm Paige.

19:50.969 --> 19:53.111
They're, uh, here about Mariah.

19:53.111 --> 19:55.296
Did you find her?  /  No.

19:55.857 --> 19:59.838
Mr. Findel told us she was 
stolen from his farm a year ago.

19:59.838 --> 20:00.716
We wouldn't know about that.

20:00.716 --> 20:03.546
Dale bought her at auction for 
cash over in Litchfield.

20:03.546 --> 20:08.622
Ah, I'm starting to feel bad for this poor 
city horse, bouncing from farm to farm.

20:08.622 --> 20:10.409
Was anything wrong with her?

20:10.409 --> 20:14.243
Dr. Simms found some internal bleeding.
We were waiting on the test results.

20:14.243 --> 20:15.989
Did, um...

20:16.131 --> 20:19.867
Do you know a Rabbit Winters up in Wallkill?

20:20.112 --> 20:24.043
He was one of the convicts 
who worked on the farm.

20:24.043 --> 20:25.714
Were you friendly with him?

20:25.714 --> 20:28.458
Dale is friendly with everybody.

20:28.458 --> 20:30.728
He's a big, sweet-hearted guy.

20:30.728 --> 20:33.608
Some people see that and take advantage.

20:33.608 --> 20:37.057
It's like... how we feel about Mariah.

20:38.517 --> 20:41.829
Well, if she turns up,
you'll let us know?

20:43.424 --> 20:45.731
Who else from your firm 
was in the city that night?

20:45.731 --> 20:49.294
Oh, um, the two grooms,
Freddy and Johnny.

20:49.294 --> 20:51.917
Uh, Paige.
She exercises the horses.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.569
We just met her.

20:53.569 --> 20:54.763
And her husband?

20:54.763 --> 20:56.620
Oh, yes, of course,
Dale was there.

20:56.620 --> 20:58.249
Did they stay with you?

20:58.249 --> 21:01.913
At the townhouse? No.
No, we put them up in a hotel near the pier.

21:01.913 --> 21:04.604
And Mariah?
Did she come along too?

21:04.604 --> 21:07.725
Well, yes, she always keeps 
the other horses company.

21:07.725 --> 21:11.666
Seems Dale's been everywhere 
with her, even overseas.

21:11.666 --> 21:14.196
Is he the stable buddy's buddy?

21:14.196 --> 21:17.183
Well, he handles all the horses.

21:17.183 --> 21:19.642
Travel arrangements, Customs.

21:19.642 --> 21:23.954
You notice any unusual behavior during the trips?

21:23.954 --> 21:25.951
I don't keep tabs on my employees.

21:25.951 --> 21:30.133
We believe Dale used Mariah to smuggle drugs.

21:34.595 --> 21:37.115
Ms. Townsend?

21:37.746 --> 21:39.905
Well, l...

21:39.905 --> 21:46.800
L-I can't imagine Dale doing anything... criminal.
I mean, he's-he's absurdly honest.

21:46.800 --> 21:50.213
Well, that's quite a vote of confidence.

21:50.506 --> 21:51.983
Uh...

21:52.591 --> 21:57.659
whose idea was it to have Dale travel 
with you...and the horses?

21:57.659 --> 21:58.972
Yours?

21:58.972 --> 22:02.699
I couldn't care less.
It was my husband's idea.

22:02.871 --> 22:04.143
Is he here today?

22:04.143 --> 22:06.409
No, he stays in the city during the week.

22:06.409 --> 22:11.985
But I'll mention your suspicions to him.
I'm sure he'll be amused.

22:11.985 --> 22:14.705
Have a pleasant drive back.

22:14.993 --> 22:17.865
You get the feeling she and 
Dale have been playing around?

22:17.865 --> 22:20.214
That's one way for Dale to 
keep going on those trips.

22:20.214 --> 22:22.788
Everybody's covering everybody's backs.

22:22.788 --> 22:24.500
Until we find Mariah,

22:24.500 --> 22:25.743
we're not gonna make any headway.

22:25.743 --> 22:28.929
The vet at the animal quarantine center, 
Dr. Reeves...

22:28.929 --> 22:31.678
Assuming he's the one that 
removed the drugs from the horse,

22:31.678 --> 22:33.239
he'd have to hand it off to Dale.

22:33.239 --> 22:35.884
Maybe when Dale was picking up the horses.

22:36.344 --> 22:38.814
Yeah. The quarantine center's 
got cameras everywhere.

22:38.814 --> 22:43.677
They'd have to do it somewhere off site, 
somewhere that wouldn't arouse suspicion.

22:44.520 --> 22:47.342
JOE'S DINER
NEWBURGH, NEW YORK
WEDNESDAY, MARCH 31

22:47.342 --> 22:49.079
Hi, Doctor.

22:50.414 --> 22:52.996
There go those facial muscles.

22:52.996 --> 22:54.082
What are you doing here?

22:54.082 --> 22:56.357
Your secretary said you eat lunch here every day.

22:56.357 --> 22:58.689
We just had to know why.

22:58.689 --> 23:01.938
It turns out it's the raisin pie.

23:01.938 --> 23:03.854
Waitress told us it was the house specialty.

23:03.854 --> 23:08.487
She also said she's seen you a few times
hunched over the trunk of your car...

23:08.487 --> 23:11.977
with somebody who looks just 
like this guy...Dale Mullen.

23:11.977 --> 23:13.789
Yeah. I don't know him.

23:14.050 --> 23:17.897
I got divorced a year ago.
I've been selling off our old stuff over the Web.

23:17.897 --> 23:21.052
- Selling out of your trunk?
- Yeah, to different people.

23:21.052 --> 23:24.978
You have a peddler's license...
to peddle stuff out of your vehicle?

23:24.978 --> 23:27.853
On someone else's property,
that's trespassing.

23:27.853 --> 23:29.485
You mind opening this up?

23:29.485 --> 23:33.141
Ooh, there go your lips.
They're... They're turning white.

23:33.141 --> 23:35.484
You wanna know what that means?

23:41.760 --> 23:43.618
What was in here?

23:43.618 --> 23:45.185
Nothing. It's...

23:45.185 --> 23:46.754
Okay.

23:48.582 --> 23:50.791
Oh, well... Sorry.

23:55.422 --> 24:00.219
There's a seam from plastic packaging.

24:00.219 --> 24:03.488
Wanna tell us what was in the package, Doc?

24:10.170 --> 24:12.479
Got a dark stain.

24:12.479 --> 24:14.078
You're a vet.

24:14.639 --> 24:16.722
What do you think?

24:16.852 --> 24:18.684
Animal blood?

24:18.966 --> 24:21.130
Even I can read that expression.

24:21.130 --> 24:25.312
We're impounding your car, Doc.
We'll be in touch.

24:27.386 --> 24:30.935
Think we're gonna put things on 
hold for a while and see what happens.

24:30.935 --> 24:33.610
Right.
See what happens.

24:33.610 --> 24:36.607
Paige, you don't have to turn out Ace tonight.

24:36.607 --> 24:38.818
Shelly's gonna take him out early in the morning.

24:38.818 --> 24:40.711
Okay.

24:44.335 --> 24:46.420
What's she really want?

24:47.208 --> 24:50.116
She's canceling the trip to Vienna next month.

24:50.116 --> 24:52.172
She won't be competing for a while.

24:52.172 --> 24:54.339
She say why?

24:54.650 --> 24:57.389
What do I look like?
Her friend?

25:02.229 --> 25:06.768
We have a piece of sharp plastic 
stained with the horse's blood.

25:06.768 --> 25:09.725
The vet diagnosed her with internal bleeding.

25:09.725 --> 25:11.333
The horse was under his control.

25:11.333 --> 25:12.818
What about the two weeks it was in quarantine?

25:12.818 --> 25:15.147
Ask those people what they did to it.

25:15.147 --> 25:18.110
Your client might not like the 
answers they come up with.

25:18.110 --> 25:21.004
Especially Dr. Reeves's answers.

25:21.192 --> 25:23.966
How long you think he's gonna hold 
out before he tags you for drug smuggling?

25:23.966 --> 25:25.992
- Don't fall for this.
- Murder?

25:25.992 --> 25:27.745
- I didn't kill anybody.
- They know that.

25:27.745 --> 25:29.461
They have nothing but a pile of manure,

25:29.461 --> 25:32.853
and they're sorting through 
it hoping to find a kernel of corn.

25:32.853 --> 25:35.361
Talk to us, don't talk to us.

25:35.429 --> 25:39.368
We could dispose of the murder 
if your client has an alibi for Friday night.

25:39.368 --> 25:41.480
I was in my hotel room watching TV.

25:41.480 --> 25:42.865
You ask my wife.

25:42.865 --> 25:48.091
We will, right after we ask her about your 
globe-trotting affair with Ms. Townsend.

25:48.375 --> 25:50.915
I'm not having an affair.  /  No?

25:52.086 --> 25:54.446
Your last trip to Russia.

25:54.662 --> 25:57.710
The hotel faxed us the details of your bill.

25:57.710 --> 26:03.843
We found a couple of late-night calls from your 
room to Ms. Townsend's daughter's private line.

26:05.333 --> 26:08.579
Uh, Ms. Townsend...
She made those calls, didn't she?

26:09.442 --> 26:11.977
And next month, another romantic trip.

26:11.977 --> 26:14.163
What do you think Paige is gonna think about that?

26:14.163 --> 26:14.973
There's no more trips.

26:14.973 --> 26:17.808
Ms. Townsend's not competing
anymore this year. Okay?

26:17.808 --> 26:21.292
- That's all over.
- As is this interview.

26:25.637 --> 26:28.341
Your hands take a beating.

26:29.743 --> 26:33.355
I work 'em.
Can't always wear gloves.

26:33.628 --> 26:35.519
Our luck.

26:43.126 --> 26:45.130
Can you get an order to pull some blood?

26:45.130 --> 26:46.480
From Mr. Mullen?

26:46.480 --> 26:47.794
He doesn't look like a user.

26:47.794 --> 26:50.347
Well, if he's handled heroin in the last three weeks,

26:50.347 --> 26:54.034
and it got into his bloodstream 
through the cuts on his hand,

26:54.153 --> 26:56.742
it'll show up on a tox screen.

26:58.947 --> 27:01.237
The tox screen came back negative for heroin.

27:01.237 --> 27:02.647
We ordered up the full menu.

27:02.647 --> 27:04.924
Dale's in the clear for controlled substances.

27:04.924 --> 27:06.821
B-But when, uh...

27:06.821 --> 27:08.564
when they tested him for steroids,

27:08.564 --> 27:11.522
he came up positive for gonadotropin.

27:11.522 --> 27:15.208
It's a drug used to increase sperm motility.

27:15.208 --> 27:18.177
Dale's taking male fertility drugs?

27:18.177 --> 27:20.383
Not the smartest thing to do 
if you're cheating on your wife.

27:20.383 --> 27:25.439
Gets results.
And he said that Marguerite Townsend 
was taking time off from competitive jumping.

27:25.439 --> 27:28.812
All that jumping and jarring is not so good for a baby.

27:28.812 --> 27:31.198
Marguerite Townsend is pregnant?

27:31.198 --> 27:33.922
Uh, sounds like it.

27:34.710 --> 27:36.533
And if she's keeping the baby,

27:36.533 --> 27:38.703
then she must think that her husband is the father.

27:38.703 --> 27:41.838
He might be, even if Dale is taking fertility drugs.

27:41.838 --> 27:45.038
Still, even with all the contraception in the world,

27:45.038 --> 27:46.675
for a man who's taking fertility pills...

27:46.675 --> 27:50.771
Dale should be very concerned the baby might be his.

27:50.771 --> 27:53.355
Assuming he knows he's taking the pills.

27:54.088 --> 27:57.064
Someone else might be pulling the reins.

28:01.337 --> 28:03.330
There's nothing here.

28:03.330 --> 28:06.924
We don't use heroin or any drugs.
Do you think we wanna get fired?

28:10.271 --> 28:12.664
Why are you taking those?

28:12.951 --> 28:14.155
It's what we do.

28:14.155 --> 28:16.375
So, speaking of being fired,

28:16.828 --> 28:19.662
aren't you worried that 
Ms. Townsend won't be competing?

28:19.662 --> 28:22.696
No. It's only temporary until her baby comes.

28:22.696 --> 28:25.154
And her girls'll still be on the junior circuit.

28:25.154 --> 28:27.687
I'm surprised that you and Dale don't have kids.

28:27.687 --> 28:30.242
And raise them where?
Above a garage?

28:30.242 --> 28:32.559
There's a lot of space outside.
I mean, horses...

28:32.559 --> 28:35.284
Not my space. Not my horses.

28:35.463 --> 28:37.634
Are you almost done?

28:38.152 --> 28:40.472
Yeah, just one more thing.

28:40.472 --> 28:44.629
That Friday night, did you and your husband 
go to the dinner for the horse show?

28:44.629 --> 28:45.991
We weren't invited.

28:45.991 --> 28:48.386
We worked the horses; 
then we went back to the hotel.

28:48.386 --> 28:51.676
I went to sleep, and Dale stayed 
up in the sitting room watching TV.

28:51.676 --> 28:52.952
- Sitting room?
- Mm-hmm.

28:52.952 --> 28:56.360
So the Townsends,
they got you nice hotels.

28:56.360 --> 29:00.325
Um, is it the kind with the key 
cards and the minibars?

29:00.325 --> 29:02.138
Yeah.

29:07.274 --> 29:12.019
I got his toothpaste and mouthwash.
And look what I found.

29:12.019 --> 29:14.621
She's on the pill.

29:19.065 --> 29:21.258
Chewing tobacco.

29:21.258 --> 29:23.190
Already opened.

29:26.567 --> 29:30.620
The tobacco is cut so that it 
nicks the gums when you use it.

29:30.620 --> 29:33.858
It's a very efficient way to deliver 
nicotine to the bloodstream.

29:33.858 --> 29:36.089
Not to mention fertility drugs.

29:36.089 --> 29:41.894
His wife spiked his chew.
But Paige is on the pill.

29:42.364 --> 29:44.597
She's not out to get herself pregnant.

29:44.597 --> 29:46.863
She's out to get Marguerite Townsend.

29:46.863 --> 29:49.166
You'd think Dale would have 
the brains to use condoms.

29:49.166 --> 29:51.959
Paige had the brains to find where he kept 'em.

29:51.959 --> 29:53.974
We passed their photos around local drugstores.

29:53.974 --> 29:56.653
Dale was I.D.'d buying condoms in one place,

29:56.653 --> 29:59.655
while Paige was I.D.'d buying 
the same condoms in another.

29:59.655 --> 30:02.938
She pokes a couple of pin pricks in 'em,
makes the switch,

30:02.938 --> 30:06.577
Dale's turbocharged swimmers do the rest.

30:06.577 --> 30:07.767
And with Dale using condoms,

30:07.767 --> 30:11.325
Marguerite Townsend would feel pretty 
confident that her husband's the father.

30:11.325 --> 30:13.950
What's in it for Paige?
Revenge?

30:14.198 --> 30:17.881
She might be trying to break 
up Marguerite's marriage.

30:19.566 --> 30:22.464
So it isn't Sunnybrook Farm.

30:23.414 --> 30:27.363
Just make sure babies aren't 
the sideshow to the main event.

30:28.010 --> 30:30.202
Well, babies rate pretty high in my book.

30:31.001 --> 30:33.658
Maybe drugs are the sideshow.

30:34.185 --> 30:37.170
OFFICE OF JAMES TOWNSEND
73WALL STREET 
MONDAY, APRIL 29

30:37.170 --> 30:40.638
My wife told me that you actually 
suspect Dale of running drugs?

30:40.638 --> 30:42.841
What's your evidence?
Drugs? Money?

30:42.841 --> 30:43.836
No drugs.

30:43.836 --> 30:46.835
And money's easy to hide,
as long as you don't spend it.

30:46.835 --> 30:48.432
Well, I hope you're wrong.

30:48.432 --> 30:53.130
Dale told us that it was your idea to have him 
accompany your wife overseas.

30:53.130 --> 30:56.274
No. No, Paige was the one who suggested it.

30:56.274 --> 30:58.517
You don't think she's involved in this.

30:58.517 --> 30:59.846
Now that you mention it...

30:59.846 --> 31:02.814
She has a terrific reputation as a horsewoman.

31:02.814 --> 31:06.848
It makes no sense that she 
would jeopardize her future like this.

31:07.281 --> 31:11.986
You know, we're sorry to bother you 
at a time like this...your wife's pregnancy.

31:11.986 --> 31:13.593
A blessed event.

31:13.593 --> 31:15.190
You can say that again.

31:15.190 --> 31:16.777
I've always wanted a boy.

31:16.777 --> 31:18.504
Ms. Townsend must be thrilled.

31:18.504 --> 31:20.825
Actually, it blindsided both of us.

31:20.825 --> 31:23.111
But Megs can use a break from competitive jumping.

31:23.111 --> 31:25.776
She gets so stressed before every show.

31:25.776 --> 31:27.664
Like the one two weeks ago?

31:28.107 --> 31:29.223
How'd she handle it?

31:29.223 --> 31:31.011
She paced downstairs all night.

31:31.011 --> 31:32.905
That's her routine.

31:32.905 --> 31:34.831
What is this call?

31:34.994 --> 31:38.448
It's on your return list.
It's from the McCarter Farm.

31:38.448 --> 31:40.528
Is that a Connecticut number?

31:40.528 --> 31:42.414
You can read that from there?

31:42.414 --> 31:45.285
It says "Re P.M."

31:45.908 --> 31:48.467
P.M. Uh, Paige Mullen?

31:48.467 --> 31:50.547
They left a message with my secretary.

31:50.547 --> 31:52.018
I think it's about a reference.

31:52.018 --> 31:54.670
I hope she's not planning on leaving us.

31:55.520 --> 31:58.418
My wife and I sell organic feed.

31:58.418 --> 32:01.031
Ms. Mullen was looking to open an account with us.

32:01.031 --> 32:03.319
Wejust needed a reference.

32:03.319 --> 32:05.052
The place for sale?

32:05.052 --> 32:06.569
Oh, that's an old sign.

32:06.569 --> 32:09.573
But the earth is pretty fresh.

32:09.573 --> 32:14.730
The sign's been taken down recently.
You find a buyer?

32:16.134 --> 32:18.100
What do you got there?

32:23.311 --> 32:25.257
What a gorgeous horse.

32:25.257 --> 32:28.672
Yeah, he's a foundation stallion.

32:28.953 --> 32:30.945
He's got beautiful legs.

32:30.945 --> 32:32.522
Hyah!

32:32.779 --> 32:35.504
That horse is gonna make a goodjumper.

32:37.303 --> 32:40.695
Now, has Ms. Mullen seen him?

32:42.745 --> 32:45.288
Is that who's gonna buy your farm?

32:45.530 --> 32:47.923
Farm. Horse.

32:47.923 --> 32:51.437
Uh, look, she asked me not to talk about it.

32:51.437 --> 32:53.017
How much did she offer?

32:53.017 --> 32:55.339
Just over 600,000.

32:55.339 --> 32:58.304
Did she say where she was getting the money?

32:58.478 --> 32:59.854
Investments.

32:59.854 --> 33:03.793
She put 10,000 down and said 
she'd get me the rest in four months.

33:03.793 --> 33:06.177
Did she come alone or with her husband?

33:06.177 --> 33:09.846
- She didn't mention being married.
- Hey, Clare.!

33:10.631 --> 33:12.316
Four months.

33:12.602 --> 33:14.642
Must be when her investment matures.

33:16.401 --> 33:20.963
Argentina?
You don't even speak Spanish.

33:20.963 --> 33:25.422
So? Lots of Americans have bought 
ranches down there in "Pintagonia."

33:25.422 --> 33:29.153
Patagonia, Dale.
It's called Patagonia.

33:29.153 --> 33:32.522
You can't expect me to just leave my life here.

33:32.522 --> 33:37.612
You won't. I'll go down first,
set everything up with the money I saved.

33:37.612 --> 33:40.037
Brand-new lives, Paige.

33:40.037 --> 33:43.513
You and me?
Brand-new.

33:48.178 --> 33:51.502
So the money from the farm could be 
coming from Dale Mullen's drug dealing.

33:51.502 --> 33:53.983
He's only made four trips.
Subtract expenses,

33:53.983 --> 33:57.185
his split with Dr. Reeves,
he wouldn't have enough to buy the farm.

33:57.185 --> 34:00.812
In four months...Marguerite Townsend 
is gonna be in her third trimester.

34:00.812 --> 34:05.183
That's too late for an abortion,
too late to lose the baby from an accident.

34:05.183 --> 34:07.090
That's when Paige will approach her.

34:07.090 --> 34:10.099
Blackmail her.
Threaten to tell Mr. Townsend the baby isn't his.

34:10.099 --> 34:13.050
Should be worth at least a million bucks.

34:13.717 --> 34:16.933
Yeah, a payday that Molly Simms almost spoiled.

34:16.933 --> 34:19.466
You know, if Dale got arrested for the drug smuggling...

34:19.466 --> 34:23.788
before he impregnated Marguerite,
that would have ruined Paige's plan.

34:23.788 --> 34:26.190
So they both have a motive to kill Dr. Simms,

34:26.190 --> 34:28.344
and they're each other's alibi.

34:28.344 --> 34:30.853
I don't see how you pry them apart.

34:30.853 --> 34:35.652
You know,
Dale might have a better alibi.

34:35.652 --> 34:40.739
James Townsend said...
his wife was up all night pacing.

34:40.739 --> 34:43.828
Maybe she found another way to calm her nerves.

34:43.828 --> 34:46.469
So now you have three 
people with a secret to protect...

34:46.469 --> 34:49.905
and every reason not to incriminate each other.

34:50.838 --> 34:53.333
We do have one wild card.

34:54.612 --> 34:57.040
Dale, your new friends are here.

34:57.040 --> 34:59.490
They want to take a look at Mariah's stall.

34:59.490 --> 35:01.258
It's this one over here.

35:01.938 --> 35:03.397
Wh... What are you looking for?

35:03.397 --> 35:07.374
A bit, or her blanket...anything with
her D.N.A. On it to make a positive I.D.

35:07.374 --> 35:09.071
You found Mariah? Is she okay?

35:09.071 --> 35:10.794
We can't get into that right now.

35:10.794 --> 35:13.739
If you don't need me anymore,
I have to have some lunch with my friends.

35:13.739 --> 35:16.537
"Absurdly honest."

35:17.208 --> 35:19.276
That's what you called Dale, isn't it?

35:19.276 --> 35:20.732
Do you still stand by that?

35:20.732 --> 35:23.050
I haven't seen any evidence to the contrary.

35:23.050 --> 35:26.318
Oh, you will,
once our vet examines Mariah.

35:26.318 --> 35:29.887
And then anybody standing too 
close to Dale better take a step back.

35:29.887 --> 35:31.613
I didn't do anything.

35:31.613 --> 35:35.011
You know, we...
we really need to ask...

35:35.011 --> 35:39.227
how Dale packed one of your horses full of heroin,

35:39.227 --> 35:41.586
put him on the plane with you...

35:41.586 --> 35:43.274
and flew back home.

35:43.274 --> 35:45.330
Dale is responsible for the horses.

35:45.330 --> 35:47.275
I don't even fly with them on the same plane.

35:47.275 --> 35:48.865
What about you, Paige?

35:48.865 --> 35:53.533
You didn't notice all that fresh drug 
money flowing into the household?

35:53.533 --> 35:56.541
Uh, if Dale struck it rich,
he forgot to tell me.

35:56.541 --> 35:59.076
Well, that's some vote of confidence.
You know, Dale,

35:59.076 --> 36:03.986
I think they're already starting to step back.

36:04.370 --> 36:06.675
You know,
the night that Molly was killed...

36:06.675 --> 36:11.129
you told us that Dale was in the hotel room watching TV.

36:11.129 --> 36:13.251
Yes.

36:13.621 --> 36:15.328
And you told us you were asleep.

36:15.328 --> 36:17.509
I kept waking up because of the TV.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.788
But you didn't get out of bed.  /  No.

36:19.788 --> 36:25.351
So you really don't know if he 
was actually in the sitting room.

36:26.008 --> 36:29.218
Now, Paige,
don't think with your heart.

36:29.218 --> 36:31.814
Think with your head.
Because a lie won't save Dale,

36:31.814 --> 36:34.055
but it will hurt you.

36:35.240 --> 36:39.467
I didn't see him. He might have gone out.
He said he might go check on the horses.

36:39.467 --> 36:43.151
Paige.  /  I'm sorry, honey.
I just messed it up.

36:43.151 --> 36:46.903
That leaves you unaccounted for at a very bad time.

36:46.903 --> 36:50.261
I didn't kill that girl.
I wasn't anywhere near those stables.

36:50.261 --> 36:51.669
I was out walking around.

36:51.669 --> 36:53.883
We'd really love to take your word for it,

36:53.883 --> 36:57.915
but unless you can give us the 
name of somebody who saw you...

37:04.542 --> 37:06.999
You know something about this?

37:06.999 --> 37:10.457
No. I'm sure Dale is telling the truth.

37:10.457 --> 37:11.749
I was with her.

37:11.749 --> 37:14.850
L-l-I went to meet her at a hotel.
A real fancy one.

37:14.850 --> 37:17.364
- That is an obscene lie.
- Obscene?

37:17.364 --> 37:20.420
Obscene for someone like you to 
be sleeping with someone like him?

37:20.420 --> 37:22.413
Well, that's what she did.
We've been going at it since last fall.

37:22.413 --> 37:24.739
Oh, shut your low-class mouth!

37:24.739 --> 37:27.659
I'm sorry, Paige.
I didn't think you wanted me anymore,

37:27.659 --> 37:29.438
and you know how she likes to flirt.

37:29.438 --> 37:32.903
I don't want to listen to this filth.
I want this man out of my barn now.!

37:32.903 --> 37:36.060
Ms. Townsend, sooner or later 
you'll have to answer the question:

37:36.060 --> 37:39.868
Did you meet him at a hotel that night?

37:41.647 --> 37:44.834
Yes.
Oh, don't expect me to apologize.

37:44.834 --> 37:46.196
I'm not the one who let his talents go to waste.

37:46.196 --> 37:48.357
Don't talk to her that way.

37:50.167 --> 37:56.272
Oh. Uh...Wow, these 
quick-release knots,

37:56.272 --> 38:00.583
they are, uh, very quick.

38:01.714 --> 38:06.146
You know, Dale, Paige would have
been disappointed if you hadn't...

38:06.146 --> 38:08.952
if you hadn't ended up with Marguerite.

38:08.952 --> 38:11.598
What are you talking about?

38:12.527 --> 38:16.672
Do you notice a... like, an extra...

38:16.672 --> 38:19.742
kick in your... in your step?

38:19.742 --> 38:22.540
Or, um, you know, like, an extra...

38:22.540 --> 38:24.815
bounce in the bedroom?

38:24.815 --> 38:26.384
Maybe. So what?

38:26.384 --> 38:29.395
It's the fertility drugs you've been taking.

38:29.849 --> 38:32.480
- I don't take that stuff.
- Yes, you do.

38:32.480 --> 38:36.362
It's ground in your chew,
thanks to Paige.

38:37.291 --> 38:39.911
Your condoms...
You hide 'em in here?

38:39.911 --> 38:42.056
Or in your truck?

38:42.056 --> 38:43.991
Well, anyway,
Paige found your stash.

38:43.991 --> 38:48.091
Your condoms now have a small 
design flaw called a pinhole.

38:48.091 --> 38:51.441
- Oh, my God.
- It's a bunch of lies!

38:51.441 --> 38:54.430
- I don't get it. Why would Paige...
- I'll show you.

38:57.058 --> 38:59.975
His name is Pepper Pot.

39:00.295 --> 39:04.383
He's a foundation stallion.
That's a beautiful animal.

39:05.862 --> 39:10.610
All in, including the farm that he lives on,
it's just over $600,000.

39:10.610 --> 39:11.859
Paige...

39:12.760 --> 39:15.362
already put a deposit down.

39:16.314 --> 39:19.000
Where were you getting all this money?

39:20.627 --> 39:23.270
Stud fees.

39:26.208 --> 39:29.165
The baby that Marguerite is carrying...

39:29.165 --> 39:30.747
Odds are...

39:31.057 --> 39:32.746
it's yours.

39:35.396 --> 39:39.697
PoorJames. He's been...
He's been wanting a son for so long.

39:39.697 --> 39:42.848
But, you know,
with his sperm count, he's...

39:43.911 --> 39:48.129
shooting blanks.
While Dale here, he's, uh,

39:48.129 --> 39:50.472
practically a Gatling gun.

39:50.472 --> 39:56.588
Four months from now Paige was gonna shake down 
Ms. Townsend...for a nice slice ofher family fortune.

39:56.588 --> 39:58.194
Yeah.

39:58.194 --> 40:01.179
No more exercising their horses.

40:01.179 --> 40:04.155
No more living above their garage.

40:04.155 --> 40:07.567
This would be your place, your horse.

40:07.567 --> 40:10.357
I wasn't gonna blackmail anyone.
That horse... That is just a dream.

40:10.357 --> 40:13.304
A dream that almost slipped through your fingers.

40:13.666 --> 40:15.182
You see,

40:15.182 --> 40:20.717
Paige wanted to keep you out of trouble 
long enough to get Marguerite pregnant.

40:21.134 --> 40:24.681
Molly Simms was about to blow 
the cover off your drug smuggling.

40:24.681 --> 40:26.332
Paige killed her.
I should have known.

40:26.332 --> 40:29.091
Shut up!
I didn't kill her!

40:30.363 --> 40:32.646
Everyone else has been spoken for but you.

40:32.646 --> 40:34.411
I was in my room.

40:34.411 --> 40:37.017
Anybody see you?
Maybe you ordered room service?

40:37.017 --> 40:38.510
No, I told you.
I was sleeping.

40:38.510 --> 40:40.472
Well, then you have a problem.

40:40.472 --> 40:44.419
You know the nice hotel room 
Ms. Townsend put you in?

40:44.659 --> 40:47.346
The one with the electronic key card?

40:47.346 --> 40:52.029
It has a security system that records 
every time someone opens the door.

40:52.029 --> 40:55.169
Now, your room,
the door was opened four times...

40:55.169 --> 40:58.195
after 11:30 that Friday night.

40:58.195 --> 41:02.147
Two of the times must have been when
Dale went to see Marguerite and came back.

41:02.147 --> 41:04.511
That's not right.
Dale probably forgot something.

41:04.511 --> 41:06.584
Opened it, reached in,
grabbed it and left.

41:06.584 --> 41:09.425
That still leaves the fourth time the door was opened.

41:09.425 --> 41:11.601
That's after Dale came back.
I woke up, I was cold,

41:11.601 --> 41:13.703
I asked him to have the hotel send up a blanket,

41:13.703 --> 41:16.421
he opened the door,
he reached and got the blanket.

41:16.421 --> 41:18.437
You remember,
don't you, honey?

41:18.437 --> 41:20.761
Before you answer,

41:20.761 --> 41:26.657
you should know that in her conversation
with the owner of the horse and the farm,

41:27.127 --> 41:29.754
your name never came up.

41:29.754 --> 41:31.378
You're not part of the plan.

41:31.378 --> 41:34.304
No.! Dale, it was for both of us.

41:34.304 --> 41:36.009
Who you gonna believe?

41:36.009 --> 41:38.934
You gonna believe this 
woman who put you out to stud?

41:38.934 --> 41:41.253
It's why she married you.
It's why she brought you here.

41:41.253 --> 41:43.392
You don't belong here.

41:43.392 --> 41:46.187
You don't belong upstairs with Marguerite.

41:46.187 --> 41:48.872
- Not even downstairs with Paige.
- No. You do.

41:48.872 --> 41:50.516
You belong with me.

41:50.516 --> 41:54.299
She put you here to use you, Dale,

41:55.403 --> 41:57.567
just like Mariah.

41:57.567 --> 42:02.714
You know, everybody's stable buddy,
bouncing from farm to farm.

42:03.895 --> 42:09.562
Paige hitched her wagon to you just long enough...
to get where she was going.

42:09.749 --> 42:12.982
Now she thinks her ride is over.

42:13.147 --> 42:14.792
What do you think?

42:15.350 --> 42:18.397
I know what happened.
I didn't forget anything in the room.

42:18.397 --> 42:21.754
I didn't get you a blanket.
I told her about the heroin.

42:21.754 --> 42:25.212
- I told her Molly would figure it out.
- You dumb ox!

42:25.212 --> 42:28.505
When I came back to the room,
her clothes were in a pile, all sweaty,

42:28.505 --> 42:30.743
her hair was wet from taking a shower.!

42:30.743 --> 42:33.857
You didn't think I'd notice?
You didn't think I'd figure out what you did?

42:33.857 --> 42:37.723
You think I'm just a big,
sweet-hearted dummy.

42:37.723 --> 42:41.631
She doesn't anymore.
You're under arrest, Paige.

42:42.566 --> 42:44.697
Ohh! Ho-ho!

42:44.697 --> 42:47.415
Why are you so high and mighty?
I didn't waste Dale's talent!

42:47.415 --> 42:49.067
I sure didn't waste yours!

42:49.067 --> 42:54.516
I've seen brood mares offer 
themselves up with more fight!

42:58.159 --> 43:00.942
I need to tell you.
Mariah's fine.

43:00.942 --> 43:03.398
I boarded her on a farm up near Ghent.

43:03.398 --> 43:05.373
We figured.

43:08.634 --> 43:12.625
When I was a kid,
I used to dream about living on a horse farm.

43:12.866 --> 43:14.526
That's a nice dream...

43:14.526 --> 43:16.536
for a horse.
