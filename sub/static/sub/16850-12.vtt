00:02.670 --> 00:06.374
Welcome, friends, to the season
finale of Children's Hospital.

00:06.407 --> 00:10.178
We're doing something special,
we're broadcasting live.

00:10.211 --> 00:12.180
As it happens, ahh!

00:12.213 --> 00:14.448
Oh, my.. Oh, my God, David!
Are you okay?

00:17.285 --> 00:19.453
I really hurt my head.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.293
No retakes. No editing.

00:25.326 --> 00:28.496
You'll watch the drama unfold
in real time as our actors

00:28.529 --> 00:31.399
perform it in front
of our three cameras.

00:31.432 --> 00:35.703
So ready titles,
we're going live, now.

00:35.736 --> 00:38.672
[theme song]

00:46.214 --> 00:47.748
Glenn, what's the matter?

00:47.781 --> 00:51.119
Oh, this whole Valerie thing,
I can't get over it.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.621
I wonder if I'll just
be alone forever.

00:53.654 --> 00:56.857
You can always watch television.
Do you like television?

00:56.890 --> 00:59.393
Big Bang Theory,
has its moments.

00:59.427 --> 01:03.197
I'm a news junkie, you put on
CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, I'm done.

01:04.298 --> 01:06.167
Hey, can we help you?

01:06.200 --> 01:08.669
I'm special envoy for Sultan
Habrah bin Baneez of Sardonia.

01:08.702 --> 01:10.471
- Did you catch any of that?
- Gobbledegook.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.173
There's been emergency.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.208
The Sultan's on business,
and his index finger

01:14.242 --> 01:16.177
has been severed
by a deli slicer.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.811
Why was he using
the deli slicer?

01:17.845 --> 01:20.248
No time to explain, this
is the closest hospital

01:20.281 --> 01:22.250
and you must re-attach,
the royal finger.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.252
Sultan will be here
in five minutes.

01:24.285 --> 01:26.420
But we don't have
a hand surgeon here.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.856
We used to have one,
her name was Cat Black

01:28.889 --> 01:30.858
but she died in childbirth.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.860
- RIP.
- LOL.

01:32.893 --> 01:35.896
- I can do it.
- Blake?

01:35.929 --> 01:39.133
Before Cat died she taught
me all about hand surgery.

01:39.167 --> 01:41.369
The richest, most powerful
sultan in the Middle East

01:41.402 --> 01:43.304
will not be treated
by a clown.

01:43.337 --> 01:46.240
- Or a Jew.
- Fine, suit yourself.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.511
Hey, Blake,
you're being selfish.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.880
Take off the stupid makeup
and do the operation.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.882
Oh, yeah? Maybe I
should take off

01:54.915 --> 01:57.751
my stupid integrity
too, huh?

01:57.785 --> 02:00.588
Hey, this man could die,
and he's the only hope

02:00.621 --> 02:02.390
for peace
in the Middle East.

02:02.423 --> 02:05.293
- And how do you know that?
- Because I'm a news junkie.

02:05.326 --> 02:08.461
Put on CNN, MSNBC,
Fox News, and I'm done.

02:08.496 --> 02:12.666
Now, what are you, Blake?
A clown or a fool?

02:12.700 --> 02:14.502
(cameraman)
- Slow down! Slow down...
- Slow down!

02:17.638 --> 02:20.574
- Camera 3, camera 3!
- Two cameras are down.

02:20.608 --> 02:23.211
- Go, go.
- We've got one camera.

02:23.244 --> 02:25.213
- We gonna cut?
- 'We're live.'

02:25.246 --> 02:27.915
'We've gotta do the whole thing
with one camera.'

02:27.948 --> 02:30.551
Then, let's get back to
what we were talking about.

02:30.584 --> 02:33.621
You'll have blood on your hands
if you don't help this guy.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.423
I can't,
I can't do this.

02:35.456 --> 02:37.658
- You can't do the operation?
- I can't do this.

02:37.691 --> 02:40.628
I can't do this, okay.
I got no theater training.

02:40.661 --> 02:43.431
- Where's he going? Stay in it.
- No, you stay in it.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.869
Well, if Blake were here,
he'd say something like

02:48.902 --> 02:51.705
"You do the surgery",
and I'd say, "I can't do it.

02:51.739 --> 02:55.643
I'm not a hand specialist
blah, blah, blah"

02:55.676 --> 02:58.879
and then, uh, Blake,
would come back with

02:58.912 --> 03:01.982
"Then he's gonna have to go
to a different hospital."

03:02.015 --> 03:04.652
But he'd say it,
like he would say it.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.920
And we.. Yeah, we'd
just go back and forth.

03:06.954 --> 03:10.658
Like, I'd say a line and then
he would say a line and then..

03:11.725 --> 03:13.827
- You're Blake?
- Yeah.

03:13.861 --> 03:18.999
"Because I'm a news junkie,
Blake. Put on CNN, MSNBC..

03:19.032 --> 03:21.435
"Yes. You're the one
who has to get real.

03:21.469 --> 03:23.871
"Sorry, Owen, you can tell them
not to bother sending

03:23.904 --> 03:26.240
"in the clowns, because these
colors don't run.

03:26.274 --> 03:29.343
Suddenly Lola runs in, guys,
the sultan's arriving now."

03:29.377 --> 03:32.313
Guys, the sultan's arriving now.

03:32.346 --> 03:34.315
You stand down, Blake,
you coward!

03:34.348 --> 03:35.949
You let the real
surgeons handle this.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.318
Yeah, come on!

03:38.886 --> 03:41.755
Sultan Habrah bin Baneez,
of Sardonia!

03:43.657 --> 03:45.859
[speaking Hindi]

03:45.893 --> 03:47.895
Sultan would like to meet
the hand specialist

03:47.928 --> 03:49.897
that will make him
whole again.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.700
Yes, the hand specialist
is not here right now.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.369
He's performing a very
important hand job.

03:55.403 --> 03:58.472
[speaking Hindi]

03:58.506 --> 04:00.608
Sultan would like to know
where is Malik?

04:02.343 --> 04:05.546
Malik, I never knew I could
love again so deeply

04:05.579 --> 04:06.914
and so out of context.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.049
- Stop, stop, stop.
- Darling, what is it?

04:09.082 --> 04:11.885
Customs of my country dictate,
that I must marry a woman

04:11.919 --> 04:15.723
- with royal blood, I'm sorry.
- But, I do have royal blood.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.060
- Yeah, I totally have it, yeah.
- That's wonderful.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.496
I mean, you must submit
to a DNA test

04:22.530 --> 04:24.532
but that's only
a formality of course.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.974
(camera man)
'Go, Right there.'

04:34.007 --> 04:36.910
"Who am I?
What do I stand for?

04:36.944 --> 04:40.013
"The makeup or the man?

04:40.047 --> 04:44.518
Perhaps, the time has come.
If Gene Simmons--"

04:44.552 --> 04:46.754
I'll do it. I'll do it.
Go go go.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.989
Who am I.. I got it.
I got it.

04:49.022 --> 04:51.425
Who am I anyway?
The makeup or the man?

04:51.459 --> 04:53.427
Perhaps, the time has come.

04:53.461 --> 04:57.365
If Gene Simmons can take off
his makeup, so can I.

04:57.398 --> 05:01.001
Valerie, Valerie, I can't take
it anymore, I want you.

05:01.034 --> 05:04.004
I want you too, Glenn,
as a friend, I just..

05:04.037 --> 05:06.640
You're not self-sacrificing
and gutsy enough to be my lover.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.442
I'm sorry.

05:08.476 --> 05:10.444
- I am, I'm self-sacrificing.
- No, you're not.

05:10.478 --> 05:13.747
The sultan's leaving and will
likely die from losing a finger.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.649
(Blake)
'Wait!'

05:15.683 --> 05:21.422
The finger surgeon has arrived,
and he's ready to operate.

05:21.455 --> 05:24.858
I had no idea that's what you
looked like with no makeup.

05:24.892 --> 05:29.863
This is it, and it feels so good
to be 100% free of that makeup.

05:29.897 --> 05:32.700
Now people will judge me for
the content of my character.

05:32.733 --> 05:35.803
- Let's get him to the OR.
- Let's do it.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.505
- Come on.
- Let's cut him open.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.973
- Get him to the elevator!
- Come on, people.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.909
- Go go go.
- Push the button.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.578
There's no time.

05:44.612 --> 05:47.415
(male announcer on intercom)
'Attention hospital staff,
the elevator which was'

05:47.448 --> 05:50.451
'supposed to be fixed by now,
apparently hasn't been fixed'

05:50.484 --> 05:52.453
'so you have to take
the stairs.'

05:52.486 --> 05:54.455
- Stairs.
- Stairs!

05:54.488 --> 05:58.759
He's not gonna fit we can't take
the gurney through the stairs.

05:58.792 --> 06:03.531
No. No, I'm good, I'm good.
It's fine, God!

06:03.564 --> 06:04.965
Glenn, press the button,
third floor!

06:04.998 --> 06:06.834
That dialogue isn't
relevant anymore.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.770
- There's a lot of stairs.
- I think I sprained my taint.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.505
Hey, Dylan.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.841
Oh! Hi, Dr. Gaffer.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.976
Slow down.
Everybody, slow down.

06:16.009 --> 06:18.412
I thought they were supposed
to fix the elevator.

06:18.446 --> 06:20.414
The elevators haven't
been working

06:20.448 --> 06:22.382
since they shot Scrubs here.

06:27.488 --> 06:30.791
Okay, Valerie, prepare
the anesthetic.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.693
Wait, give me a second.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.162
- Into the OR.
- Come on, come on.

06:35.195 --> 06:37.130
One second.

06:37.164 --> 06:40.200
Okay, come on, get the finger.
Where's the finger? Who has it?

06:40.233 --> 06:41.702
Where is it?

06:41.735 --> 06:43.704
Doctors, doctors,
can I speak to you?

06:43.737 --> 06:47.575
I can't find the finger. I swear
I had it, but I can't find it!

06:47.608 --> 06:48.976
Well, that sucks.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.978
I'll cut off
my own finger!

06:51.011 --> 06:53.013
The sultan will never
know the difference.

06:53.046 --> 06:55.549
How self-sacrificing
and gutsy of you.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.551
That was my intention.

06:57.585 --> 07:00.954
Now, let's go to Room 16
and cut off my finger.

07:02.490 --> 07:07.495
- Wait.
- Okay, wrong door, wrong door.

07:07.528 --> 07:08.929
Here we go.

07:08.962 --> 07:13.233
Now, I'm going
to put my hand..

07:13.266 --> 07:19.773
I'm going to put my hand on
the table and cut my finger.

07:19.807 --> 07:22.009
Wait, before you do that.

07:26.547 --> 07:27.548
Valerie.

07:27.581 --> 07:28.649
Here goes.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.586
Ahh!

07:32.620 --> 07:36.123
- What a brave sacrifice!
- No, I really cut my hand.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.692
- To save a great leader!
- No, shut up.

07:38.726 --> 07:40.928
I need a doctor.
I need a real doctor.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.963
I'm not kidding.
I really cut myself.

07:42.996 --> 07:46.133
Just, in the name of love,
you did it.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.736
Are you stupid? Do you
understand what's happening?

07:48.769 --> 07:52.105
I cut right to the bone.

07:52.139 --> 07:55.175
Oh, I gotta go to a doctor.
Oh, I got to go.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.177
Get out of my..

07:57.210 --> 08:00.180
Well, we have
Glenn's finger

08:00.213 --> 08:04.718
we can move on to
the operation scene room.

08:04.752 --> 08:06.854
Okay, yes.

08:06.887 --> 08:10.090
All right, great, we have the
finger right now, Mr. Sultan.

08:10.123 --> 08:12.726
- Let's do this, I'm ready.
- Good, because there's no time.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.796
- We're losing him!
- Then, give me that scalpel.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.231
Oh, my God! Valerie,
what's going on?

08:18.265 --> 08:20.233
You're suffering from
temporary onset

08:20.267 --> 08:22.235
of arthromendicular chlorosis.

08:22.269 --> 08:24.237
- English?
- Shaky hands.

08:24.271 --> 08:25.272
In Hindi?

08:25.305 --> 08:27.074
[speaking Hindi]

08:27.107 --> 08:30.544
It's like my brain knows what
to do, but my hand is junk.

08:30.578 --> 08:33.179
Damn it, there's only one doctor
that could do this procedure

08:33.212 --> 08:34.682
that's Cat Black.

08:34.715 --> 08:37.150
That's Cat Black to you.

08:37.183 --> 08:41.688
Cat! Oh, my God, wait,
we watched you die

08:41.722 --> 08:43.691
right here in this room.

08:43.724 --> 08:46.126
It's a long boring story,
but the basic thing is

08:46.159 --> 08:49.830
I didn't die, but my brain was
washed of all medical knowledge.

08:49.863 --> 08:53.834
Wait a second, that's it.
With Blake's, medical know-how

08:53.867 --> 08:56.269
and your muscle memory,
we just might be able to--

08:56.303 --> 08:58.939
Wait a minute, Owen, are you
thinking what I'm thinking?

08:58.972 --> 09:00.941
I assume so,
I basically said it.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.743
Cat, are you ready
for this?

09:02.776 --> 09:05.913
- Let's do it.
- Let's go, scramble!

09:05.946 --> 09:09.883
Get to your positions.

09:09.917 --> 09:14.688
Okay, Cat, take the finger.

09:14.722 --> 09:18.759
Now put it where his
finger used to be.

09:18.792 --> 09:22.796
Now suture
and sew it up.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.898
That's it,
We're done!

09:29.169 --> 09:32.840
Malik, Malik, darling.

09:32.873 --> 09:35.242
- Chief, we did it!
- Wonderful.

09:35.275 --> 09:37.277
And I'm ready for
that DNA test now.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.279
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.281
Give me your finger,
my love.

09:41.314 --> 09:44.251
I have the DNA test.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.957
Chief, what is this?

09:49.990 --> 09:54.294
Okay, okay, I'll come clean,
I'm not royalty, Malik.

09:54.327 --> 09:56.363
I thought if I stole
the sultan's finger

09:56.396 --> 09:59.900
I could cheat the DNA test
and then you'd marry me.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.335
- Do you hate me?
- Uh, yes.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.037
Wait!

10:04.071 --> 10:06.940
I have something to
come clean about too.

10:06.974 --> 10:09.009
I'm not who you
think I am.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.712
I didn't come here as
Cat Black's replacement

10:11.745 --> 10:14.047
I came here to
settle a score.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.049
When Arthur Children's
founded this hospital

10:16.083 --> 10:18.085
he had an illegitimate son
he kept hidden

10:18.118 --> 10:20.087
from the hospital gentry
at that time.

10:20.120 --> 10:26.994
I am not Valerie Flame, daughter
of Alma and Telery Flame.

10:27.027 --> 10:29.362
- I'm Derrick Children's!
- What?

10:29.396 --> 10:33.333
Long lost son of
Arthur Children's.

10:33.366 --> 10:40.073
Derrick Children's,
Derrick Children's.

10:40.107 --> 10:45.012
Lucky to be a woman, it was
the best part of my manhood

10:45.045 --> 10:48.115
best part of myself.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.083
This is one nutty hospital.

10:50.117 --> 10:53.053
