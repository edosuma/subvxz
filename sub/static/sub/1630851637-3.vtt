09:59.299 --> 10:01.468
- But you'll have $500.

10:01.501 --> 10:04.104

Go.

We were allowed to
bring a fabric from home,

the color of the carpet.</i>

10:25.692 --> 10:29.429

really strong gold accent</i>

10:29.462 --> 10:31.131

<i>My color scheme is
pretty much just blood red.</i>

10:39.939 --> 10:42.876

10:42.909 --> 10:46.813

ceremony to bathe in blood

10:46.846 --> 10:48.882

19:44.217 --> 19:48.221
- Yeah, I feel it.
- Oh, Lord. We'll see.

19:48.254 --> 19:49.656
All right. Can
you get to sewing?

19:49.689 --> 19:51.491
- Okay. I'm getting
ready to cut.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.125
- Oh.

19:53.126 --> 19:54.361
Coral?
- Yes?

19:54.394 --> 19:58.565
- This fabric's fabulous.
- Thank you. This is my fabric.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.800
- You brought it?
- Yeah.

20:00.834 --> 20:04.671
My mom, her sister,
my aunt had cancer.

20:05.572 --> 20:09.142
And she brought me this
fabric, and she passed away.

20:09.175 --> 20:10.343
- Okay.
- Yeah. So--

20:10.377 --> 20:12.545
- So it has a lot of meaning.
- Yeah.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.914
<i>I was born in Mexico City.</i>

20:14.948 --> 20:18.510
<i>And Halloween, we call
it El Día de las Brujas.</i>

20:18.840 --> 20:21.888
And November 2, we
celebrate the Day of the Dead.

20:21.921 --> 20:25.258
<i>We celebrate, and we
still remember the people</i>

20:25.291 --> 20:27.394
<i>who have passed away.</i>

20:27.427 --> 20:32.131
So I want to make this
dress to celebrate my aunt.

20:32.132 --> 20:36.569
<i>I'm making a mermaid
dress. It's working perfectly.</i>

20:36.603 --> 20:42.375
Everything is very symmetrical.
And to me it looks haunting.

20:43.309 --> 20:44.511
- What else is it gonna be?

20:44.544 --> 20:46.460
Is it gonna be
long? Is it--what--

20:46.790 --> 20:47.747
- I have a lot
of fabric of this.

20:47.781 --> 20:50.850
So I might use some
of this as a train.

20:50.884 --> 20:52.152
- Mm-mm.
- No?

20:52.185 --> 20:54.320
- Well, don't--don't
ruin the beauty.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.822
- Yeah, right.
- Figure it out.

20:55.855 --> 20:59.124
You have a really amazing
fabric, a great story.

20:59.125 --> 21:00.593
You got to really push the idea

21:00.627 --> 21:02.328
of this silhouette
and the shape.

21:02.362 --> 21:03.763
- Okay.
- I'm excited.

21:03.797 --> 21:05.198
- Me too. Thank you.

21:06.666 --> 21:09.369
- The fabric looks amazing.
- Thank you.

21:10.637 --> 21:14.841
- All right, Kenneth. What's
the real concept here?

21:14.874 --> 21:18.445
- I actually I'm loving
this green right now.

21:18.478 --> 21:21.314
It's still very like
camouflage-y effect.

21:21.348 --> 21:23.829
- Okay.

21:23.830 --> 21:25.185
I don't understand really yet
what it's gonna be but, like,

21:25.218 --> 21:28.188
I think that you need to
really figure out a concept.

21:28.221 --> 21:30.357
Dig deep for a real inspiration.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.158
- Okay.
- Like, what creeps you?

21:32.192 --> 21:33.727
Bugs or rats?

21:33.760 --> 21:37.230
- Rats are okay. I had about
maybe like 40 rats growing up.

21:37.263 --> 21:39.399
- What? 40 rats?

21:39.432 --> 21:41.134
- 40 rats.
- Like, at one time?

21:41.167 --> 21:42.302
- Like at one time, yep.

21:42.335 --> 21:43.803
- Like, just--running around?

21:43.837 --> 21:45.939
- I had a little cage that
my parents built it for me

21:45.972 --> 21:47.874
and I was just like
taking care of them.

21:47.907 --> 21:50.143
And then they just
keep making babies. So--

21:50.176 --> 21:53.980
- Oh, totally, 'cause that's
what rats do. They multiply.

21:54.140 --> 21:55.648
- [laughs]

21:55.682 --> 21:57.984
A lot of people
find rats to be, like,

21:58.180 --> 22:00.487
nasty and dirty, you know?

22:00.520 --> 22:02.288
<i>But growing up
in the Philippines.</i>

22:02.322 --> 22:04.157
They're like my little friends.

22:04.190 --> 22:05.959
I give them shower every day.

22:06.590 --> 22:07.327
- Okay.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.396
- I have a good time
with my rats growing up.

22:09.429 --> 22:11.698
- What else is creepy?
- Snakes.

22:11.731 --> 22:15.235
I was actually touching
that little snake-like figurine

22:15.268 --> 22:18.104
in the mirror earlier. So
that's why I was like, okay.

22:18.138 --> 22:19.272
- You gotta go
for this, I think.

22:19.305 --> 22:20.473
- Okay.

22:20.507 --> 22:22.442
- Good luck.
- Thank you, Christian.

22:25.780 --> 22:27.447
- Katie, hey.
- What?

22:27.480 --> 22:30.283
- You better not give
that little sailor look.

22:30.316 --> 22:31.618
- It's not gonna
be a sailor look.

22:32.596 --> 22:33.819
It is not sailor.

22:33.820 --> 22:36.222
- It is Popeye goes West, honey.

22:36.256 --> 22:37.691
You don't see it at all?

22:37.724 --> 22:39.526
- Well, I see the stripes.

22:39.559 --> 22:42.562
- But what about
this is, like, haunting?

22:42.595 --> 22:44.297
<i>- I don't do dark.
I don't do black.</i>

22:44.330 --> 22:47.600
You might feel like when
you wear all black you are cool

22:47.634 --> 22:48.702
or you look slimmer.

22:48.735 --> 22:51.838
But does wearing
black bring you joy?

22:51.871 --> 22:55.942
<i>No. Color really does
affect how you feel.</i>

22:55.975 --> 22:59.512
So I've, like, made it my
mission to, like, help people

22:59.546 --> 23:03.249
<i>not worry about if
this style is the thing</i>

23:03.283 --> 23:06.119
to make me look the slimmest.
Just wear what makes you happy.

23:06.152 --> 23:09.506
And this sounds the
opposite of all those things.

23:09.507 --> 23:11.424
- Why don't you reference
things that you think

23:11.458 --> 23:12.726
are kind of dark

23:12.759 --> 23:14.561
and haunting and creepy
that come from stripes?

23:14.594 --> 23:16.229
- I do like timber.

23:16.262 --> 23:18.965
- A little bit quirky, happy,
creepy, weirdest stripes.

23:19.650 --> 23:21.735
- Dead doll.
- Dead doll. I love it.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.169
- Okay. Here, I'm gonna do it.

23:23.203 --> 23:25.405
- You're gonna do it?
Are you scared now?

23:25.438 --> 23:27.340
- Yeah, thanks.
- Okay, use it.

23:27.374 --> 23:28.508
- Okay.

23:28.541 --> 23:29.743
I really loved this.

23:29.776 --> 23:31.177
I thought it was
gonna be beautiful.

23:31.211 --> 23:32.579
But it's not haunting enough.

23:32.612 --> 23:35.915
- All right, guys, you
have about an hour left.

23:35.949 --> 23:38.651
And I'll be back tomorrow
with your models.

23:38.685 --> 23:41.354
So, have a good
night. all: Good night.

23:44.524 --> 23:48.294
- Faster, faster,
faster. And I go, go, go.

23:48.328 --> 23:50.960
- So much sh-- to do.

23:53.767 --> 23:55.735
- I'm struggling here.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.706
- Okay, guys, I think
it's time to go home.

23:59.739 --> 24:02.542
- Ugh, no. I want
to work all night.

24:02.575 --> 24:05.145
- I keep running out of time.
- Bye, work room.

24:05.178 --> 24:06.913
Thank you for the stress.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.489
<i>- Coming up...</i>

24:09.490 --> 24:11.351

Up close is scary.

24:13.530 --> 24:14.921

24:14.954 --> 24:16.122
Five minutes.

24:29.903 --> 24:33.540

25:02.469 --> 25:04.771

25:15.480 --> 25:17.117
- How you doing Katie B?
- Feeling sweaty.

25:17.150 --> 25:19.185
I'm incorporating the
pink somewhere like this.

25:19.219 --> 25:20.620
I got to still do that side.

25:20.653 --> 25:22.288
<i>After talking to
Christian yesterday,</i>

25:22.322 --> 25:26.626
I'd come up with the new
idea of haunted creepy doll.

25:26.659 --> 25:28.862
- What are you gonna
do with the black strips?

25:28.895 --> 25:30.363
- Dat, dat, dat
like it's stitched.

25:30.397 --> 25:31.498
- Oh, like the
dat, dat, dat, dat?

25:31.531 --> 25:32.365
- Like the dat, dat, dat, dat.
- Dat, dat, dat, dat.

25:32.399 --> 25:33.333
And is it gonna
go ooh, ah, ah, ah?

25:33.366 --> 25:35.535
- Yes. Something like that.
- Yeah, okay.

25:35.568 --> 25:36.770
<i>- I just have a hard time</i>

25:36.803 --> 25:38.138
<i>when Christian gives
negative feedback.</i>

25:38.171 --> 25:39.939
I'm like, "Oh, the
teacher doesn't like this?

25:39.973 --> 25:42.242
I've got to change it
because I want to get an A."

25:42.275 --> 25:43.877
I have to make sure
that the skirt and the shirt

25:43.910 --> 25:47.480
are ready for fitting
so I can't spend time.

25:47.514 --> 25:49.416
- Time, yeah. Right,
that's what I see.

25:49.449 --> 25:50.650
<i>- When I was in art school,</i>

25:50.684 --> 25:52.352
<i>some of the students
made really cool art</i>

25:52.385 --> 25:54.554
that they totally got bad
grades on the assignment

25:54.587 --> 25:56.222
because they didn't
fulfill the assignment

25:56.256 --> 25:57.557
the way the teacher wanted it

25:57.590 --> 25:58.992
but what they made
was still really cool.

26:00.560 --> 26:03.830
I feel like I should
be like that instead,

26:03.863 --> 26:06.700
but I always worry
about what people tell me.

26:06.733 --> 26:08.101
- Well, models
will be here soon.

26:08.134 --> 26:10.170
- That's good. I can
get that part ready.

26:11.338 --> 26:14.307
- Hello. all: Hi.

26:14.341 --> 26:15.608
- Are we anxious for models?

26:15.642 --> 26:16.843
- Yes.

26:16.876 --> 26:18.578
- Let's do it.
- Yes.

26:19.713 --> 26:21.548
- Hi!
- Oh, come my girl.

26:21.581 --> 26:24.499
- Hi, Diana. Nice
to see you too.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.219
- Look at you. You look good.

26:26.720 --> 26:29.549
Baby, you got legs.
Let's ----ing rock them out.

26:29.550 --> 26:31.191
- Yeah. You can go
ahead and put this on.

26:34.494 --> 26:36.396
- Chasity.

26:37.630 --> 26:41.669
What's happening? Is
she couture and stunning?

26:41.670 --> 26:44.838
- Not yet. I'm still building.
I wanted to fit her first

26:44.871 --> 26:46.973
so I'm gonna build on this
so we don't see much of this.

26:47.730 --> 26:48.475
- How are you gonna pin them on?

26:48.508 --> 26:49.676
How are you gonna sew them on?

26:49.709 --> 26:50.844
- Hand sew.

26:50.877 --> 26:52.779
- Just hand sew the whole thing?

26:52.780 --> 26:53.480
- How else am I
gonna get it on there.

26:53.513 --> 26:55.181
- I don't know.
- Oh.

26:55.215 --> 26:56.883
What I'm really worried about
is making sure that I finish.

26:56.916 --> 27:00.854
I am someone who likes
to sit and hand sew things.

27:00.887 --> 27:03.230
I'm learning on Project
Runway you just can't really sit

27:03.560 --> 27:05.258
and just hand sew,
girl. You gotta hurry up.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.860
- I'm rooting for
you for this one.

27:06.893 --> 27:08.261
- You didn't vote for
me for the last one?

27:08.294 --> 27:11.297
- Well, listen. Sometimes
you're killing me.

27:14.734 --> 27:16.169
- You're getting
quicker and quicker.

27:16.202 --> 27:20.740
- Oh yes, it fits you
perfect. I'm so happy.

27:20.774 --> 27:22.420
- Mimi.
- Yes?

27:22.750 --> 27:23.743
- Nobody wants you
to see this season.

27:23.777 --> 27:25.245
- Nobody wants to
see my beautiful face.

27:25.278 --> 27:28.682
- Oh my God, yes. Last
episode she was in a mask too.

27:28.715 --> 27:30.617
- It was all about
wrapping her face up.

27:30.650 --> 27:33.530
- You feel me, right?
- But it looks cool.

27:33.860 --> 27:36.559
- I was thinking like this
could be like the mouth,

27:36.560 --> 27:38.892
and the earrings
could be like the eyes.

27:38.925 --> 27:40.226
But I want her
to see fully still.

27:40.260 --> 27:42.462
- I love it. I mean,
that is really cool.

27:42.495 --> 27:44.631
- But not costume-y. Key word.

27:44.664 --> 27:47.867
- Yeah. Lots of sewing.
- I know.

27:50.700 --> 27:51.938
- It's pretty tight now. I
know you won't be able

27:51.971 --> 27:54.274
to walk but I just want
to get the proportion right.

27:54.307 --> 27:56.435
- Not small walk, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

27:56.436 --> 27:58.645
- How's it going?
- Good. I couldn't wait

27:58.678 --> 28:01.648
till she got here so I can get
some of the proportions right.

28:01.681 --> 28:03.717
- Yeah. Good luck on
how she's gonna walk.

28:03.750 --> 28:05.118
- Well, no, I'm gonna
do a band around it

28:05.151 --> 28:07.120
and make it like a
drawstring in the back.

28:07.153 --> 28:08.788
- All right, well, figure
out this proportion

28:08.822 --> 28:11.491
because that's the
whole look here.

28:11.524 --> 28:13.159
- Yeah.
- Fabulous.

28:13.193 --> 28:15.228
- Thank you.
- Christian was like,

28:15.261 --> 28:17.497
"You'd like to work in this
fabric that don't stretch?"

28:17.530 --> 28:21.101
I said. "This is the--the
best fabric to working in."

28:21.134 --> 28:22.936
- All right, what's happening?

28:23.360 --> 28:24.104
- I'm gonna cut the bottom

28:24.137 --> 28:25.238
and then I'm
gonna add the flair.

28:25.271 --> 28:26.806
- And still add the flair?
- And still add the flair.

28:26.840 --> 28:28.675
- Can you walk
in this right now?

28:32.379 --> 28:34.180
Mm-hmm. You love all that?

28:34.214 --> 28:35.463
- Yeah.

28:35.464 --> 28:37.499
- You do? You love
how it bunches and--

28:37.500 --> 28:39.486
- At the top, the front?
- Everywhere.

28:40.530 --> 28:42.122
I told you this fabric
has no give, no stretch.

28:42.155 --> 28:45.158
- Well, it hasn't
been sewn yet, so--

28:45.191 --> 28:46.292
- Walking slow.

28:46.326 --> 28:48.194
- Thank you, Christian.
- Okay.

28:52.132 --> 28:53.433
- Hello.

28:53.466 --> 28:54.868
- She's naked?
- No.

28:54.901 --> 28:56.403
- On the front?
- No.

28:56.436 --> 28:57.671
- What happens?

28:57.704 --> 28:59.172
- I'm gonna add,
like, the pleatings

28:59.205 --> 29:01.274
just like what we talked
about the--the reptile--

29:01.307 --> 29:02.776
- Oh, you're gonna
cover up the front?

29:02.809 --> 29:04.511
- Just right here.

29:04.544 --> 29:08.481
- You gotta come look
at this. Up close is scary.

29:08.515 --> 29:11.151
It's really uneven
and really distracting.

29:11.184 --> 29:14.854
So I think you should focus
on getting this front to be...

29:14.888 --> 29:17.390
- Perfect.
- Pleated did exactly the same.

29:17.424 --> 29:19.559
Will you turn around?
Now, same thing back here.

29:19.592 --> 29:20.560
- Yeah.
- This is just--

29:20.593 --> 29:22.195
- Even, even.
- Yes.

29:22.228 --> 29:23.697
- Make them even.

29:23.730 --> 29:25.309
Like, if this is a pleat
and this is a pleat,

29:25.310 --> 29:26.566
like, you're so close.

29:26.599 --> 29:28.268
- Mm-hmm.
- Go. Go.

29:28.301 --> 29:29.169
- Okay. Let's go.

29:29.202 --> 29:32.439
My gown is so close
on being stunning.

29:32.472 --> 29:35.675
<i>But now there is
pressure and the time limit.</i>

29:35.709 --> 29:37.177
<i>It's very chaotic.</i>

29:37.210 --> 29:38.645
When you're an artist,
you just want to make sure

29:38.678 --> 29:41.147
everything looks
so good and perfect.

29:41.181 --> 29:45.509
<i>So I need to make sure that
it's balanced on both sides</i>

29:45.510 --> 29:48.540
and focus more of
my time doing that.

29:49.322 --> 29:51.257
- I love this whole
look already.

29:51.291 --> 29:52.959
Yeah.

29:56.763 --> 29:59.131
- The leg out is giving me life.

29:59.132 --> 30:02.168
- I'm spinning, I'm spinning,
I'm spinning, I'm spinning.

30:03.737 --> 30:06.906
[gasps] This is so stunning.

30:06.940 --> 30:08.208
- You know "Predator?"

30:08.241 --> 30:10.176
- What about this is "Predator?"

30:10.210 --> 30:13.713
- It's Predator's wife.
- Are you crazy?

30:13.747 --> 30:16.883
Get out of here.
Get to the chopper.

30:16.916 --> 30:18.385
I don't know what that means.

30:18.418 --> 30:21.287
- Hold this. Don't
let it drift down.

30:21.321 --> 30:23.323
Okay. I'll cut the
lace for the back.

30:23.356 --> 30:27.727
I'm using my own fabric,
creating a corset base

30:27.761 --> 30:30.300
<i>and for the gown shape.</i>

30:30.630 --> 30:31.664
<i>I grew up in Shanghai, China</i>

30:31.698 --> 30:34.401
<i>and I draw inspiration
from my personal life.</i>

30:34.434 --> 30:37.570
For example, my
past relationship

30:37.604 --> 30:39.673
<i>make me feel I was choking.</i>

30:39.706 --> 30:43.877
<i>So you can see the black
and some choking placement</i>

30:43.910 --> 30:46.146
<i>I detailed for my design.</i>

30:46.179 --> 30:49.149
I really believe the
transformative power of art.

30:49.182 --> 30:52.585
That's how I encourage
myself and overcome myself

30:52.619 --> 30:54.688
from the past period.

30:54.721 --> 30:56.122
You like it?

30:56.156 --> 30:58.825
- What happens underneath?
- Oh, I haven't done yet.

30:58.858 --> 31:01.561
On the sides, I will
have the half circle

31:01.594 --> 31:03.630
all the way going from the side

31:03.960 --> 31:05.265
and having the
tulle sticking out.

31:05.298 --> 31:07.100
- Really?

31:07.133 --> 31:09.436
- But the dress
underneath is so beautiful.

31:09.469 --> 31:11.571
On the runway, it's
just gonna look kind of

31:11.604 --> 31:14.307
like a big tulle blob.

31:14.341 --> 31:17.277
This is a really
beautiful, elegant shape.

31:17.310 --> 31:19.245
Don't just stick
tulle on the sides.

31:19.279 --> 31:21.681
- Okay. Thank you.
- Have fun.

31:21.715 --> 31:22.982
- Thank you, Christian.

31:24.984 --> 31:26.386
- Perfect.

31:26.419 --> 31:28.555
- All right, everybody say
goodbye to your model.

31:28.588 --> 31:31.291
- Thank you, Briana.
- Thank you so much.

31:31.324 --> 31:33.126
It was a pleasure.
Thank you so much.

31:33.159 --> 31:34.894
- Thank you, Deedee.

31:34.928 --> 31:36.996
- You're gonna have
until the end of tonight.

31:37.970 --> 31:39.432
And then tomorrow is the runway.

31:39.466 --> 31:40.633
Isn't that scary?

31:40.667 --> 31:41.968
- Yeah.
- It will be.

31:42.200 --> 31:43.303
- It's scary for
multiple reasons.

31:43.336 --> 31:44.571
All: Yes.

31:44.604 --> 31:45.805
- Scary look.
- Yes.

31:45.839 --> 31:47.474
- Scary time constraints.

31:47.507 --> 31:50.477
- And scary you're
still standing here.

31:50.510 --> 31:52.245
- Goodbye.

31:59.953 --> 32:01.855
- This is hot.

32:01.888 --> 32:03.523
Bitch.

32:06.960 --> 32:10.530
- That's so beautiful.
Your dress, Coral.

32:10.563 --> 32:13.660
- Oh, thank you.

32:13.990 --> 32:14.634
What are you painting yours?

32:14.668 --> 32:15.835
- Yeah.

32:15.869 --> 32:17.937
<i>Why did I decide to use white?</i>

32:17.971 --> 32:20.607
To make something white
haunting you have to, like,

32:20.640 --> 32:24.544
really throw in some creepiness
in ways that I'm not sure

32:24.577 --> 32:26.980
<i>I will be able to
execute well enough.</i>

32:27.800 --> 32:28.314
I'm really worried

32:28.348 --> 32:30.350
that I'm gonna go
home on this challenge.

32:30.383 --> 32:32.849
- Why are you--why are
you making that face?

32:32.850 --> 32:33.687
- Because I feel
like I'm going home.

32:33.720 --> 32:35.879
- You don't like it?

32:35.880 --> 32:37.424
- I feel like my whole
look isn't gonna be enough.

32:37.457 --> 32:40.760
- Oh. What have you got to do?
- To change this? I can't.

32:40.794 --> 32:43.229
- Hey, everybody. Time's up.

32:43.263 --> 32:45.999
- No.
- Girl, put that up. Time's up.

32:57.310 --> 33:00.947
- This celery is a little bad.
- It's was frozen, yes.

33:02.949 --> 33:04.918
- I've been up since 4:00,
and I don't think I felt this--

33:04.951 --> 33:06.186
- You've been up since 4:00?
- Yes.

33:06.219 --> 33:07.654
When I finally
looked at my watch,

33:07.687 --> 33:09.756
it was 4:20 and I was
like, "Are you kidding me?"

33:09.789 --> 33:11.424
And I'm thinking
about the runway,

33:11.458 --> 33:14.260
I'm thinking about my dress,
and I never went back to sleep.

33:14.294 --> 33:16.496
I did pack up my stuff.

33:16.529 --> 33:18.932
<i>I'm, like, trying

33:18.965 --> 33:21.134

33:21.167 --> 33:22.702
It's like a mixture of the two.

33:22.736 --> 33:26.239
- It's always anxious on
runway day, the night before.

33:26.272 --> 33:27.729
- Yeah.

33:27.730 --> 33:29.409
- We have to go bury the runway.

33:29.442 --> 33:30.543
- Let's do it.

33:30.577 --> 33:31.578

All: Me.

33:58.772 --> 34:01.441

- Can you walk?

34:48.788 --> 34:50.156

34:50.190 --> 34:51.690
- I don't have the

34:51.725 --> 34:53.193
That's the only thing.

34:53.226 --> 34:54.661
<i>- The model is, you know,</i>

34:54.694 --> 34:56.763
<i>just a little bit
uncomfortable with walking.</i>

- So I'm gonna have to--should
I take one of them out?

Once I take that other
pleat out you'll be fine.

35:12.450 --> 35:14.414
- I think I have to
open more in the back.

35:15.782 --> 35:17.650
<i>- When I think about masquerade,</i>

35:17.684 --> 35:19.519

and when I think about someone
who's the host of the party

35:21.755 --> 35:24.524
is what I see Deedee
being. I think of over the top.

35:24.557 --> 35:27.293

smashed into the
side of Deedee's head.

35:45.745 --> 35:47.213

- So try to, like--
- So when I spin--

- Ooh.

<i>- I don't think I am
running in any issues at all.</i>

Besides that, you know,
like the last finish touches

36:01.535 --> 36:04.330

36:04.364 --> 36:06.399
<i>And those things take some time.</i>

36:06.433 --> 36:09.302

- It's hemmed and everything.

36:09.336 --> 36:11.571
I just need to tuck the side.

36:21.748 --> 36:23.383
Can you walk?

36:23.416 --> 36:24.884
- She can walk.
- You're gonna "practice"?

36:24.918 --> 36:27.454
So that means no.

36:27.487 --> 36:29.289
Why? It's too long?

36:29.322 --> 36:31.569
- No.
- It looked long.

36:31.570 --> 36:32.459
- Was it long? Did
it feel long to you?

36:34.961 --> 36:36.129
- It's really tight.

36:36.162 --> 36:38.639
- I'm gonna work
it out, Christian.

36:38.640 --> 36:39.232
- Mm-hmm.

36:42.469 --> 36:45.271
- You can see to walk, right?
- Yeah.

36:45.305 --> 36:46.740
- All right, guys.

36:46.773 --> 36:48.740
When you're ready, don't
forget to take your models

36:48.108 --> 36:49.309

36:49.342 --> 36:50.744

36:56.182 --> 36:57.584
- Octavio, nice to meet you.

36:57.617 --> 36:59.419
I was thinking
of a French twist.

36:59.452 --> 37:02.155
But this as high as you can.

37:03.390 --> 37:05.492
- I want her to
wear it like this.

37:05.525 --> 37:07.761
And then another
across the nose.

37:14.234 --> 37:17.737
- Oh, you're stressing
me out. Stop it.

37:17.771 --> 37:20.140
- You're gonna put a zipper
in. You're gonna fit her.

37:20.173 --> 37:22.175
You're going to
make sure it's perfect.

37:22.208 --> 37:24.511
Cool. Sounds good to me.

37:24.544 --> 37:27.847

- Yeah.

37:46.966 --> 37:48.601
- Yeah? You're not gonna trip?

37:48.635 --> 37:50.670
- I'm going to bring it up
the front a little bit more.

37:50.704 --> 37:51.504
- No tripping.

37:51.538 --> 37:54.107
How's it going?
- It's going well.

37:54.140 --> 37:55.875

ruffles in your hands.

37:55.909 --> 37:58.845
- Yes.
- Yes. Yes. Okay.

38:01.681 --> 38:03.850

Hold your--arch your back in.

38:12.826 --> 38:13.860
Perfect.

38:19.833 --> 38:22.350
That's it.

38:22.680 --> 38:23.370
Five minutes.

38:23.403 --> 38:25.104

one, you have to cut it.

38:25.105 --> 38:26.239
- This is what's blocking you?

38:26.272 --> 38:27.474
- Yes.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.951

better. Is that everything?

38:38.510 --> 38:42.188
- All right guys, time's up.
Let's head backstage, okay.

38:47.594 --> 38:49.696

At this point, I'm just like, get
something down the runway.

it better for her.

loved to see that, yeah.

hard for her to walk in,</i>

52:05.859 --> 52:08.328

52:08.361 --> 52:10.663
on that part of the dress
which was not well constructed.

52:10.697 --> 52:11.598
- Yeah, yeah.

52:11.631 --> 52:13.566
- There was also
some issues in the bust.

52:13.600 --> 52:16.870
I think that with such
a bright color, too,

52:16.903 --> 52:18.605
it shows every single flaw.

52:18.638 --> 52:20.540
- Yeah.
- Tell me about the fabric.

52:20.573 --> 52:22.442
Why did you choose this fabric?

52:22.475 --> 52:24.511
- I just wanted something rich.

52:24.544 --> 52:27.180
I just liked the
texture of the fabric.

52:27.213 --> 52:30.150
- But this is a fabric
that is so ambitious...

52:30.183 --> 52:31.685
- I know.

52:31.718 --> 52:35.855
- Because it has zero stretch.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

52:35.889 --> 52:38.324
- I was just
feeling bad for her.

52:38.358 --> 52:39.859
It was hard for me to watch

52:39.893 --> 52:42.262
and I really couldn't get
into all of this fabulousness.

52:42.295 --> 52:44.597

in the mansion.

53:09.856 --> 53:12.726
It has kind of like a
wrapping snake in the bottom.

53:12.759 --> 53:17.129

follow through the whole cobra,

drama on the mask.

it because, again,

so--I'm into dramatics.

I just couldn't put
my finger on it.

draped a piece of fabric on it.</i>

the mark for me.

56:07.367 --> 56:10.236
is the Chasity was
almost eliminated.

56:10.270 --> 56:16.108
- Chasity, your look was poorly
constructed and unimaginative.

56:16.109 --> 56:18.311
- Oh, well. Yeah, that would
have been a big mistake.

56:18.345 --> 56:19.646
- A big mistake.
- Thank you.

56:19.679 --> 56:21.414

56:21.448 --> 56:22.849

56:31.191 --> 56:35.695
Can you talk about the fabric
that you used for the dress?

56:35.729 --> 56:37.497
- When I saw this
fabric I said, "That's it."

56:37.530 --> 56:40.659
Because it reminds
me of the black version

56:40.660 --> 56:44.170
of the gold 3D frame that I
saw in the haunted house.

56:44.204 --> 56:46.639
- How is that on
there? That fan.

56:46.673 --> 56:49.876
- It's a pleated mesh
gauze that I got from China.

56:49.909 --> 56:52.712
So when they allowed
us to bring our own fabric,

56:52.746 --> 56:54.347
this was the fabric
I wanted to bring.

56:54.381 --> 56:56.216
I just cut off what I needed

56:56.249 --> 56:58.485
and opened it up and
then hand tacked it.

56:58.518 --> 57:00.887
- I'm glad you
didn't play it safe.

57:00.920 --> 57:01.721
It played in your favor.

57:01.755 --> 57:04.691

57:04.724 --> 57:06.626

leave the runway.

57:07.794 --> 57:09.596
Well, thank you all

decision to make.

57:12.465 --> 57:14.434

- Chasity to me. Blown away.

57:27.681 --> 57:29.749
<i>I'm blown away. I
want to wear it tonight.</i>

57:29.783 --> 57:33.286
That's all I wrote for
hers. I was like, "OMG."

- Absolutely.

57:42.950 --> 57:45.130
- I really feel like today,
Chasity found her voice.

57:45.131 --> 57:46.399
- Yeah.

57:46.433 --> 57:48.768
- We have to talk
about our boy, Octavio.

57:48.802 --> 57:52.238
- I see his house. I see
his house of designs.

57:52.272 --> 57:57.944
- The hairdo, the mask,
the pockets. It was a dream.

57:57.977 --> 58:01.681
- He grabbed us from the screen
before we ever saw the look.

58:01.715 --> 58:04.116
Like I was invested
in Octavio's look

58:04.117 --> 58:05.819
before it ever hit the runway.
- Yeah.

58:05.852 --> 58:07.454
- I really am excited about him.

58:07.487 --> 58:09.222
Like I want to see
more from him.

58:09.255 --> 58:11.239
- Me too.
- Me too.

58:11.240 --> 58:12.325
- While we're on the subject

58:12.359 --> 58:14.661
of capturing things
behind the screen, Anna?

58:14.694 --> 58:18.498
<i>Because I--I damn near
cried when the look came out.</i>

58:18.531 --> 58:21.334
- Same.
- The work speaks for itself.

58:21.368 --> 58:23.737
It stands on its own.

58:23.770 --> 58:25.672
I--I have chills
thinking about it.

58:25.705 --> 58:28.341
It was avant-garde.
It was high fashion.

58:28.375 --> 58:29.609
- Fashion for me,

58:29.642 --> 58:32.112
the things that succeed so
much are things that are just on

58:32.145 --> 58:33.747
the border of going really bad.

58:33.780 --> 58:34.914
But when they go right,

58:34.948 --> 58:37.500
they take you to
a magical place.

58:38.485 --> 58:42.956
- Is it Anna? Is it
Octavio? Is it Chasity?

58:43.560 --> 58:44.824
We have, like, three
winners on our hands.

58:44.858 --> 58:46.626
- This is hard.
- But we have to choose one.

58:46.659 --> 58:48.661
- We have a phenomenal
runway. That's what we have.

58:48.695 --> 58:50.230
Yeah, that's why
we are in this--

58:50.263 --> 58:51.664
- That's what
we're here for, right.

58:51.698 --> 58:52.899
- And that's why
we're in this pickle.

58:52.932 --> 58:57.700
We have three
really fantastic looks.

58:57.737 --> 59:01.207
Now we have to talk about
who's unfortunately going home.

59:01.241 --> 59:03.777
- Well, we know that Zayden
knows how to make a dress.

59:03.810 --> 59:05.845
<i>- He had the right idea.</i>

59:05.879 --> 59:09.416
<i>The right silhouette
for her curves.</i>

59:09.449 --> 59:12.180
It was a question
of construction.

59:12.520 --> 59:16.489
- Yes. He made a dress
that she couldn't walk in.

59:16.523 --> 59:19.726
It still was beautiful
when she stood in it.

59:19.759 --> 59:21.528
- But let's talk about Kenneth.

59:21.561 --> 59:23.363
- There was nothing
flattering about this.

59:23.396 --> 59:24.564
- Yeah.

59:24.597 --> 59:26.320
- I felt that he
didn't finish it.

59:26.660 --> 59:28.339
I was, like, there is
something missing.

59:28.340 --> 59:29.235
- Yeah. It totally
looked unfinished.

59:29.269 --> 59:31.369
- It looked unfinished.

59:31.370 --> 59:32.739
- And I think when
you compare this

59:32.772 --> 59:34.240
with what we saw last week,

59:34.274 --> 59:36.810
which I know you haven't
seen, but it was a mess.

59:36.843 --> 59:41.781
- I don't have a doubt that
Kenneth has skill and talent.

59:41.815 --> 59:45.652
But some designers
just need more time.

59:45.685 --> 59:47.487
And he's one of them.

59:47.520 --> 59:50.559
- Let's talk now about Bones.

59:50.560 --> 59:52.225
<i>- I was just mad that it was
too much going on on a dress.</i>

59:52.258 --> 59:54.394
- This is like an arts
and crafts project.

59:54.427 --> 59:56.730
- There was too many feathers.

59:56.763 --> 1:00:03.336
Feathers and chains, and
a corset and gold heels.

1:00:03.370 --> 1:00:05.105
We needed to see
a few less things...

1:00:05.138 --> 1:00:06.473
- Yeah.
- Today.

1:00:06.506 --> 1:00:08.308
- Sometimes less is more.

1:00:08.341 --> 1:00:10.577
- It didn't feel
unfinished, but--

1:00:10.610 --> 1:00:12.812
- It didn't feel
started, either.

1:00:12.846 --> 1:00:14.800
- [laughs]
- You know what I mean?

1:00:14.801 --> 1:00:18.284
- Yes, I do.
- So, we know our decision.

1:00:18.318 --> 1:00:20.860
We know who's going home?

1:00:24.891 --> 1:00:32.891
- Chasity, Octavio, and Anna.

1:00:35.535 --> 1:00:38.672

1:02:10.897 --> 1:02:13.433
- Thank you, and you
can all leave the runway.

1:02:13.466 --> 1:02:14.668
- Thank you. Let's go.

1:02:14.701 --> 1:02:16.936
- Thank you.
- Well done. Well done.

1:02:18.738 --> 1:02:21.875
[cheering]

1:02:26.746 --> 1:02:32.919
- Bones, Kenneth, and Zayden,
none of you delivered looks

1:02:32.952 --> 1:02:35.321
that were hauntingly
chic tonight.

1:02:36.322 --> 1:02:38.858
And each of you
had execution issues

1:02:38.892 --> 1:02:40.660
that could send you home.

1:02:41.327 --> 1:02:42.696
- Zayden...

1:02:44.664 --> 1:02:46.990
you are in.

1:02:47.734 --> 1:02:49.302
But in the future,

1:02:49.336 --> 1:02:53.606
you need to think about
execution and comfort.

1:02:54.441 --> 1:02:57.210
Don't forget that. You
can leave the runway.

1:02:57.243 --> 1:03:00.680
- Thank you so much. And
I won't let you guys down.

1:03:00.714 --> 1:03:02.682
- We know you won't.
- Thank you.

1:03:03.783 --> 1:03:06.820
- Give me your hand,
boo. My good luck.

1:03:08.488 --> 1:03:10.190
- Kenneth and Bones.

1:03:12.580 --> 1:03:17.697
Kenneth, we felt your look
was confusing and unfinished.

1:03:18.465 --> 1:03:21.201
Bones, we loved how
much you loved your look.

1:03:21.234 --> 1:03:22.302
- Thank you.

1:03:22.335 --> 1:03:25.839
- But, unfortunately, it
felt more like a costume

1:03:25.872 --> 1:03:28.274
than the chic gown we wanted.

1:03:35.415 --> 1:03:36.983
Kenneth...

1:03:39.552 --> 1:03:41.870
you're out.

1:03:43.890 --> 1:03:47.227
- Congratulations.

1:03:47.260 --> 1:03:48.528
You got this.

1:03:48.561 --> 1:03:53.990
- Bones, that means you are
in, and you can leave the runway.

1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:55.935
- Go.
- Thank you so much.

1:03:59.472 --> 1:04:02.375
- This is really such
an amazing experience.

1:04:02.409 --> 1:04:05.245
I am very grateful
to be a part of it

1:04:05.278 --> 1:04:07.380
and to meet all these
talented designers.

1:04:07.414 --> 1:04:09.382
- You have such a
beautiful spirit Kenneth.

1:04:09.416 --> 1:04:13.118
Thank you for blessing
us with just such a positivity

1:04:13.119 --> 1:04:15.689
that I think is
just so refreshing.

1:04:15.722 --> 1:04:17.924
We wish you the absolute best.

1:04:17.957 --> 1:04:20.560
- Onto the next big
great venture in your life.

1:04:20.593 --> 1:04:21.761
- Yes.

1:04:21.795 --> 1:04:23.863
- Take care.
- Thank you.

1:04:24.698 --> 1:04:27.567
<i>- I am actually sad leaving
"Project Runway" right now</i>

1:04:27.600 --> 1:04:30.503
because I know that I
can do so much more.

1:04:33.506 --> 1:04:35.575
- Come here. One last
group hug for Kenneth.

1:04:35.608 --> 1:04:39.579
- It made me stronger
and I am not done yet.

1:04:39.612 --> 1:04:41.281
I'm just barely starting.

1:04:41.314 --> 1:04:43.616
- Hello, everybody.
- Hi, Christian.

1:04:44.451 --> 1:04:46.286
- Guys, I thought it
was a beautiful runway,

1:04:46.319 --> 1:04:48.922
and, Kenneth, you were
a joy in the workroom.

1:04:48.955 --> 1:04:51.123
One of the sweetest
designers I've ever met.

1:04:51.124 --> 1:04:52.425
So, I think you're
gonna be missed.

1:04:52.459 --> 1:04:53.893
I'm gonna send
you to the workroom

1:04:53.927 --> 1:04:55.428
to clean up your space, okay?

1:04:55.462 --> 1:04:58.980
- Thank you, Christian.
- You're welcome. Say goodbye.

1:05:00.330 --> 1:05:03.837
<i>- I know that I gave it all.
That gives me peace of mind.</i>

1:05:03.870 --> 1:05:06.106
And going home
with a grateful heart

1:05:06.139 --> 1:05:08.708
that I experienced all
of these amazing things,

1:05:08.742 --> 1:05:12.746
and the craziness of it,
and the drama, and all of it.

1:05:12.779 --> 1:05:17.317
So it's truly, truly, truly
an amazing experience.

1:05:22.956 --> 1:05:25.125
<i>- On the next
"Project Runway"...</i>

1:05:25.158 --> 1:05:27.127
- Your challenge is to create

1:05:27.160 --> 1:05:31.898
a high-end fashion look
that embraces floral prints.

1:05:31.931 --> 1:05:33.566
- Ah.

1:05:33.600 --> 1:05:36.101
- This is a fun
challenge. Step it up.

1:05:36.102 --> 1:05:37.637
- Oh my gosh, it ripped.

1:05:37.671 --> 1:05:40.473
- My son, he's turning
two, and I'm not there.

1:05:41.341 --> 1:05:43.343
- Your guest judge, Gigi Hadid.

1:05:45.111 --> 1:05:47.147
- I just have such
a gay child moment.

1:05:47.180 --> 1:05:49.616
It was like she is so pretty.

1:05:49.649 --> 1:05:51.985
- Do you think you were in
the top or the bottom today?

1:05:52.850 --> 1:05:53.520
- What is your fashion language?

1:05:53.553 --> 1:05:55.355
I don't know.
