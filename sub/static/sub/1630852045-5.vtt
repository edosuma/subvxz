00:13.514 --> 00:15.724
Take some advice
from a kid who knows.

00:15.807 --> 00:19.937
If you swipe your birth certificate
from City Hall and make a run for it,

00:20.020 --> 00:23.482
security guards are definitely
going to chase you.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.359
I had no choice.

00:25.442 --> 00:29.488
I was righting a whopper of a wrong
done unto me by none other than…

00:30.489 --> 00:32.366
my own parents.

00:33.951 --> 00:36.620
I just wanna be
You just wanna be

00:36.703 --> 00:38.372
We just wanna be

00:39.498 --> 00:42.334
I am gonna be who I wanna be

00:42.417 --> 00:44.336
My autonomy

00:44.419 --> 00:47.381
No, I won't cut my hair

00:47.464 --> 00:49.842
And I'll wear whatever

00:49.925 --> 00:55.931
I like it when I get to be myself

00:56.014 --> 00:58.809
I don't wanna be
You don't wanna be

00:58.892 --> 01:01.270
We don't wanna be told what to do

01:05.524 --> 01:09.486
To understand how I found myself
in the clutches of the law,

01:09.570 --> 01:14.032
it's best to start here, on a day
that's pretty sacred to a writer and spy.

01:15.158 --> 01:17.244
New notebook day.

01:21.999 --> 01:25.377
So far in my life,
I've filled a total of 12 notebooks.

01:25.460 --> 01:28.088
College-ruled, so you know
I'm not messing around.

01:28.172 --> 01:30.549
I filled the last one in record time.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.181
I like Mrs. Plumber.

01:37.264 --> 01:40.225
But if I was one of her dogs,
and had to wear an outfit like that,

01:40.309 --> 01:42.352
I would force her to wear one too.

01:44.479 --> 01:45.480
Finished.

01:48.817 --> 01:51.737
Are you excited to
crack that thing open, Harriet?

01:51.820 --> 01:53.363
Absolutely.

01:53.447 --> 01:56.033
I bet I'll fill this monkey up
in three months.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.577
No, two months. Maybe one.

02:05.083 --> 02:09.378
Greetings, Mr. Horatio.
How are you this fine Tuesday?

02:09.463 --> 02:12.132
-Take your seat, Harriet.
-Gladly.

02:12.216 --> 02:15.928
Ole Golly taught me
to never crack the spine of a book.

02:16.011 --> 02:20.057
But a notebook? It's your brain, heart
and guts on paper.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.976
So if you wanna make it messy,
messy it up.

02:23.060 --> 02:25.312
Except for one part:

02:26.021 --> 02:28.148
signing your name.

02:28.232 --> 02:31.610
The coup de grâce moment
of a new notebook.

02:31.693 --> 02:35.030
One goof up, and it's messed up forever.

02:40.202 --> 02:43.872
And this is the final journal
Harriet M. Welsch filled

02:43.956 --> 02:46.959
right before she wrote
the world's greatest novel.

02:47.042 --> 02:48.043
Wow.

02:48.126 --> 02:49.920
-Fascinating.
-I've read it.

02:50.003 --> 02:53.090
You'll see that her name is
written perfectly,

02:53.173 --> 02:54.341
indicating, of course,

02:54.424 --> 02:57.761
that she would go on to become
the world's greatest writer.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.891
A classmate of Harriet's,
Marion Hawthorne,

03:02.975 --> 03:04.518
did not fare as well.

03:05.978 --> 03:10.065
After failing as a writer,
she had to settle for being the president.

03:10.148 --> 03:13.569
Who cares if she brought world peace
and gave feelings to robots?

03:13.652 --> 03:15.571
Look at how she wrote her name.

03:16.613 --> 03:17.614
That's awful.

03:24.538 --> 03:28.458
Hey, Harriet. I've always wondered,
what's the "M" stand for?

03:28.542 --> 03:30.961
Oh, it's just an "M."
It doesn't stand for anything.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.130
That's a little weird.

03:34.798 --> 03:37.467
-You don't have a middle name?
-Nope.

03:37.551 --> 03:40.220
Who has a middle initial
but no middle name?

03:40.304 --> 03:42.723
Harriet M, "period" Welsch, that's who.

03:42.806 --> 03:46.101
Wait, I thought you used to write it
without a period.

03:46.185 --> 03:47.311
I don't think so.

03:47.394 --> 03:48.770
I think you did.

03:48.854 --> 03:51.148
You don't even remember
how to write your own name?

03:51.982 --> 03:56.361
It's always been "M, period."
End of sentence, end of story. Period.

03:56.445 --> 03:59.740
Unfortunately,
it wasn't the end of the story.

03:59.823 --> 04:01.366
It was just the beginning.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.955
"M, period."

04:07.039 --> 04:08.207
Just "M."

04:08.290 --> 04:09.458
Just "M."

04:09.541 --> 04:11.043
"M, period."

04:11.126 --> 04:15.631
How could I be a future famous writer
when I didn't even know who I really was?

04:15.714 --> 04:19.259
An "M, no period," or an "M, period"?

04:28.852 --> 04:32.147
In a startling development,
our archaeologist discovered

04:32.231 --> 04:37.110
that the famed writer, Harriet M. Welsch,
sometimes wrote her middle initial "M"

04:37.194 --> 04:39.655
and sometimes "M, period."

04:40.572 --> 04:42.074
What does it mean?

04:42.157 --> 04:46.703
Well, most likely, it means that
Harriet M. Welsch never truly existed,

04:46.787 --> 04:48.497
rather was a pen name kept by

04:48.580 --> 04:52.125
the amazing writer,
President Marion Hawthorne.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.384
Mom, Dad.

05:00.467 --> 05:04.555
Am I "Harriet M, period Welsch"
or "Harriet M, no period Welsch"?

05:04.638 --> 05:07.015
I need to know now!

05:08.016 --> 05:10.018
-Why, "M, period," of course.
-Just "M, no period."

05:13.272 --> 05:15.816
Honey, it's supposed to be
"M, period," because--

05:15.899 --> 05:17.317
Well…

05:17.401 --> 05:21.530
No, it's just "M." No period.

05:22.239 --> 05:25.367
How do you two not know?
You gave me my name!

05:25.450 --> 05:27.995
Well, it's complicated.

05:28.078 --> 05:30.080
We need to tell her, Carol.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.335
You see, Harriet, when I was
filling out your birth certificate…

05:36.336 --> 05:37.838
we didn't want to give you a middle name.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.557
But then we had a little glitch.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.021
Dang pen. Gotta get the ink going.

06:02.821 --> 06:05.115
I didn't think anything of it,
but apparently

06:05.199 --> 06:10.162
they put that little scribble
into the system as an "M." No period.

06:10.954 --> 06:13.165
So, I'm a scribble?

06:17.794 --> 06:20.797
Her middle name was really
an "M" scribble?

06:20.881 --> 06:24.510
It's no wonder that she never
amounted to much of anything.

06:24.593 --> 06:29.389
Not like the greatest writer-president
in the history of the known universe.

06:29.473 --> 06:32.017
Marion Angelina Hawthorne.

06:32.100 --> 06:35.812
In Greek, "Angelina" means
"messenger" and "angel."

06:37.105 --> 06:40.234
Hip-hip-hooray! Hooray!
Hip-hip-hooray! Hooray!

06:40.317 --> 06:42.277
Hip-hip-hooray! Hooray!

06:43.445 --> 06:45.030
Why didn't you try to fix it?

06:45.113 --> 06:46.532
By the time we figured it out,

06:46.615 --> 06:49.868
I guess we decided
we liked the "M," so we kept it.

06:49.952 --> 06:52.120
It's really not as bad as you think.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.123
You're right. It's worse.

06:55.207 --> 06:58.669
I can't be a writer with a scribble
for a middle name.

06:59.503 --> 07:01.547
Ole Golly, what's your middle name?

07:01.630 --> 07:04.216
Willa. Like Willa Cather, the writer.

07:05.133 --> 07:09.137
Now that is a beautiful middle name.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.564
The next morning,
I wasn't even mad anymore.

07:19.147 --> 07:23.986
Just down, really down.
Even the funnies weren't helping.

07:25.863 --> 07:27.030
Say, Harriet--

07:27.114 --> 07:31.159
Please, call me "Scribble."
I should start getting used to it.

07:31.743 --> 07:35.455
We're sorry, dear.
We didn't know it would make you so upset.

07:35.539 --> 07:37.291
And we want to make it right.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.713
It's a book of baby names. We thought--

07:42.796 --> 07:45.799
We thought you could choose
an "M" name for yourself.

07:45.883 --> 07:49.553
Then we'll all go right down to City Hall
to change it in your records.

07:49.636 --> 07:53.682
Harriet "M, period"-- because now
it stands for something-- Welsch.

07:53.765 --> 07:56.518
As much as I wanted to keep moping,

07:56.602 --> 07:59.479
the book was a tempting solution.

08:00.480 --> 08:04.610
But I needed to consult some
top-level experts before I made a move.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.612
-Harriet…
-Scribble…

08:06.695 --> 08:08.071
Welsch?

08:09.781 --> 08:13.452
Hey. This is serious.
I don't even know who I am anymore.

08:13.535 --> 08:17.664
Am I still a spy? Do I still like
tomato sandwiches? Hang on.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.880
Okay, that part of me is still good.

08:25.422 --> 08:28.383
Wait, I'm confused.
What's wrong with being a scribble?

08:28.467 --> 08:30.802
I think "Harriet Scribble Welsch"
is pretty great.

08:30.886 --> 08:34.806
Janie, have you ever heard of a writer
with "Scribble" for a middle name?

08:34.890 --> 08:37.934
Would you read a book
by Louisa "Scribble" Alcott?

08:38.018 --> 08:40.187
Yes, probably twice.

08:40.854 --> 08:44.107
My parents want me to pick
my own "M" middle name from this book.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.734
Should I even bother?

08:46.568 --> 08:48.362
You get to pick your own middle name?

08:48.445 --> 08:50.072
You should absolutely bother.

08:50.155 --> 08:54.034
All we have to do is find the "M" name
that just screams you.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.249
We started off with "Melanie."

09:03.836 --> 09:05.254
Then a "Mae."

09:08.006 --> 09:09.299
A "Margaux."

09:14.388 --> 09:15.514
A "Mordecai."

09:15.597 --> 09:16.473
Ha-ha!

09:20.727 --> 09:24.022
And saving the worst for last,
the "Merlin."

09:29.069 --> 09:30.487
Bee!

09:35.200 --> 09:37.619
Another egg cream, Darby.

09:38.287 --> 09:40.998
I think you've had enough for today,
young lady.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.166
Darby, I'm a growing girl.

09:43.250 --> 09:46.837
Please don't mess with
my egg cream intake, or I'll bite you!

09:51.300 --> 09:52.968
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

09:53.051 --> 09:54.928
I still don't see what's wrong
with "Scribble."

09:56.013 --> 09:58.932
I've seen the future of
Harriet "M Scribble" Welsch,

09:59.016 --> 10:00.434
and it ain't pretty.

10:00.517 --> 10:03.228
There are snooty bionic robots,
and Marion's the president.

10:05.647 --> 10:08.984
I think Darby's right.
You have had too many egg creams.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.444
Thanks for trying.

10:10.527 --> 10:13.739
But maybe I'm just not cut out
to be an "M" middle name person.

10:14.364 --> 10:16.408
Yeah, what if you're really not?

10:16.491 --> 10:17.576
What do you mean?

10:17.659 --> 10:20.287
That scribble your dad made
on the birth certificate,

10:20.370 --> 10:22.164
has anyone ever really looked at it?

10:22.247 --> 10:24.416
How do we know it really
looks like an "M"?

10:25.334 --> 10:27.294
We don't. You're right.

10:27.377 --> 10:30.964
It could look like a completely
different letter. Gotta check this out.

10:31.590 --> 10:36.887
Friends, this is a journey to
the deepest reaches of my soul.

10:37.429 --> 10:38.722
I gotta go solo.

10:43.644 --> 10:46.313
If she doesn't want "Scribble,"
I'm taking it.

10:48.190 --> 10:51.318
I arrived at City Hall
ready for the moment of truth.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.529
Ready to see who I really was. Ready to--

10:56.657 --> 11:00.953
Stand in a line longer than
the Mississippi River.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.455
Rats and double rats!

11:09.461 --> 11:13.465
This isn't funny, kid.
I don't know what my middle name is.

11:22.182 --> 11:25.102
That clerk looks like
a grown-up Pinky Whitehead.

11:25.185 --> 11:29.022
Maybe it's a future Pinky,
sent back through time to 1964

11:29.106 --> 11:33.360
on a daring mission to make the line go
as slowly as possible.

11:36.071 --> 11:37.072
A little tip.

11:37.155 --> 11:38.615
Next time you have a question,

11:38.699 --> 11:41.535
you can avoid the line
by calling that number.

11:47.833 --> 11:50.669
It was a number that gave me
a big idea.

11:50.752 --> 11:55.132
One that would require
the guts, skill and cunning

11:55.215 --> 11:59.553
that only a legendary spy could pull off.

12:12.274 --> 12:13.859
Scuse me for a moment.

12:14.818 --> 12:17.070
City Hall name registry. Charles speaking.

12:17.154 --> 12:21.783
Hello, Charles. My name is Carol Welsch,
yes, the Carol Welsch,

12:21.867 --> 12:26.288
and I'm stupendously busy today,
so I'm sending my wonderful daughter

12:26.371 --> 12:27.998
to review her birth certificate.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.541
Okay, ma'am, I think--

12:29.625 --> 12:34.630
But first, would you mind reading
her full handwritten name back to me?

12:35.714 --> 12:36.715
Sure.

12:37.549 --> 12:41.136
Oh, okay, I've got it, Mrs. Welsch.
The handwritten name is "Harriet--

12:41.220 --> 12:43.305
Harriet…"

12:43.388 --> 12:44.681
Yes? Yes?

12:45.474 --> 12:46.475
Harriet what?

12:46.558 --> 12:50.521
Harriet "W"? Or Harriet "R"?
A "Q" perhaps?

12:50.604 --> 12:53.607
I'm sorry,
but it's just a scribble, ma'am.

12:54.316 --> 12:57.486
A scribble? Are you sure?

12:57.569 --> 13:00.489
Yep. Like someone was trying
to get the ink started on a pen.

13:00.572 --> 13:04.785
And that's when I officially lost
what was left of my mind.

13:04.868 --> 13:07.454
Ma'am? Ma'am? Are you there?

13:08.914 --> 13:10.040
Hello? Hey.

13:10.123 --> 13:13.335
Sorry, Charles. I just need to
see something real fast. Two seconds.

13:14.002 --> 13:18.507
The clerk was right.
It was a scribble, and nothing but.

13:20.843 --> 13:24.680
Little girl, it's been two seconds.
Please return the document.

13:25.973 --> 13:29.059
I can't do that, Charles. I'm sorry.

13:30.561 --> 13:32.646
Hey! Stop her. Security!

13:32.729 --> 13:34.982
I didn't know what my legs were doing.

13:35.065 --> 13:38.277
It was like my whole body went on
bad choice autopilot.

13:38.360 --> 13:43.240
All I knew is that I was a scribble,
and I had to destroy the evidence.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.797
Get back here!

14:05.971 --> 14:08.724
I explained everything
to the security guards,

14:08.807 --> 14:10.726
but they called my folks anyway.

14:12.311 --> 14:15.272
Nah, looks like
an "E" on its side to me. It's not an "M."

14:15.355 --> 14:16.648
I think it's a "two."

14:16.732 --> 14:19.484
We are so sorry. So sorry.

14:20.819 --> 14:22.279
Harriet M--

14:22.362 --> 14:25.782
Harriet Welsch,
what in the world have you done?

14:33.290 --> 14:35.250
I'm sorry. I--

14:35.334 --> 14:38.504
I didn't wanna be a scribble.

14:38.587 --> 14:44.635
I tried to be a Meghan, and a Melanie,
and even a Merlin. What a mistake.

14:44.718 --> 14:50.015
But nothing felt right, and now
I'm not sure who I am anymore!

14:51.308 --> 14:55.103
I had gone from Harriet M. Welsch
to Harriet "Scribble" Welsch,

14:55.187 --> 14:56.688
to Harriet "Criminal" Welsch,

14:56.772 --> 14:59.566
to Harriet "Blubbering Mess of Goo"
Welsch.

14:59.650 --> 15:01.193
Oh, Harriet.

15:01.276 --> 15:02.694
We're so sorry.

15:02.778 --> 15:04.696
Mr. and Mrs. Welsch?

15:05.447 --> 15:07.783
I got this. If I may.

15:09.326 --> 15:12.079
Harriet Scribble-Doodle-Chicken-Scratch
Welsch,

15:12.162 --> 15:14.790
if you're free,
I'd like you to come with me.

15:19.169 --> 15:23.131
Where are we going? Jail? Is it jail?

15:23.215 --> 15:26.176
Harriet, I'm taking you somewhere
to show you something.

15:26.260 --> 15:28.095
That still could be jail.

15:28.178 --> 15:30.514
I want you to see
that no parents are perfect,

15:30.597 --> 15:34.601
and sometimes they can make choices
we don't always agree with.

15:35.269 --> 15:39.064
Easy for you to say,
Catherine Willa Galliano.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.779
We are going to jail, aren't we?

15:45.863 --> 15:48.115
We will be if you keep asking me that.

15:56.206 --> 15:59.293
Catherine! My baby girl!

15:59.376 --> 16:00.377
Hello, Mother.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.087
Mother?

16:02.171 --> 16:05.924
Oh, I never get visitors.
Come in, come in.

16:08.677 --> 16:09.761
Sit, sit.

16:11.805 --> 16:14.141
Make yourself comfortable.

16:17.895 --> 16:20.105
Now eat up. Don't be shy.

16:20.189 --> 16:24.735
Catherine, I can't believe
I'm finally meeting Harriet.

16:24.818 --> 16:27.988
Little Harriet in her precious
little outfit.

16:29.114 --> 16:33.118
I felt like a precious
little amoeba under a microscope.

16:33.202 --> 16:35.412
Aren't you just precious?

16:36.288 --> 16:40.334
How come your cute little glasses
don't have lenses?

16:40.417 --> 16:42.002
These are just for spying.

16:42.085 --> 16:48.550
Of course they are. Adorable!
Look at those cheeks. Come on.

16:48.634 --> 16:50.636
Mother, please stop doting on her.

16:51.261 --> 16:54.681
I never get to pamper anyone
now that you don't live at home.

16:56.308 --> 17:00.354
Seeing Ole Golly with her mom
is like seeing a teacher outside school.

17:00.437 --> 17:02.523
It shakes your world like a maraca.

17:03.190 --> 17:07.069
Catherine, that jacket is too thin.
You could freeze to death.

17:07.152 --> 17:09.279
Get yourself a sweater from my room.

17:09.363 --> 17:12.616
Mother, it's fall in New York,
not winter in the Yukon.

17:14.617 --> 17:15.618
Okay.

17:20.707 --> 17:24.711
So, Harriet, what brings you
to Far Rockaway today?

17:24.795 --> 17:27.130
All I know is
I'm on the wrong side of the law,

17:27.214 --> 17:29.341
and Ole Golly wanted to show me something,

17:29.424 --> 17:31.760
but I don't know how someone
with a scribble for a middle name

17:31.844 --> 17:34.805
is supposed to feel better getting advice
from someone with a cool middle name

17:34.888 --> 17:36.765
like "Willa,"
so I don't think it's gonna work.

17:37.933 --> 17:40.143
You okay, Mrs. Galliano?

17:40.894 --> 17:44.273
Willa? Willa?

17:44.356 --> 17:49.111
Catherine Galliano,
you get in here this instant!

17:49.194 --> 17:50.445
Yes, Mother. What?

17:50.529 --> 17:55.409
You are not still going by that ridiculous
made-up middle name, are you?

17:56.994 --> 17:59.121
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

17:59.204 --> 18:02.249
Your middle name is not Willa.
It's Myrtle.

18:02.332 --> 18:07.129
The name of your great aunt. It is family,
and you should know better.

18:07.212 --> 18:10.132
Mother, we've been fighting over this
since I was a child.

18:10.215 --> 18:13.177
I don't like "Myrtle." It doesn't suit me.

18:13.260 --> 18:19.433
Do you wanna see your birth certificate?
You are Cathy Myrtle Galliano.

18:20.184 --> 18:23.562
Don't call me Myrtle.
And never call me Cathy.

18:23.645 --> 18:27.941
Great. Not only had
the curse of the scribble messed me up,

18:28.025 --> 18:30.611
but it was also messing up Ole Golly
and her mom.

18:30.694 --> 18:34.156
What couldn't that cruddy scribble
destroy?

18:34.239 --> 18:37.159
"Willa."
What kind of a name is that anyway?

18:37.242 --> 18:39.411
Well, it's better than being a Myrtle.

18:39.494 --> 18:43.332
I bet Myrtle didn't wanna be a Myrtle.
Who'd wanna be a Myrtle?

18:43.415 --> 18:49.755
Me! I, Harriet Welsch, like--
no, love the name Myrtle.

18:49.838 --> 18:52.549
And I hereby adopt it
as my own middle name.

18:52.633 --> 18:55.719
If that's okay with you, Mrs. Galliano.

18:55.802 --> 18:59.014
Ole Golly looked at me
like I had grown a tail.

18:59.097 --> 19:01.767
It was so convincing
that I had to check to make sure.

19:02.893 --> 19:05.270
That would be wonderful.

19:05.354 --> 19:09.775
Wonderful, Harriet!
Myrtle's name will live on.

19:09.858 --> 19:12.486
Don't do that just for me, Harriet.

19:12.569 --> 19:15.489
I only answer to "Harriet Myrtle Welsch."

19:15.572 --> 19:17.991
Well, pardon my French, but hooray!

19:18.075 --> 19:21.119
-That's not Fr--
-You are now an official member

19:21.203 --> 19:25.582
of the Galliano family,
Harriet Myrtle Welsch.

19:26.625 --> 19:31.255
Name: Harriet Myrtle Welsch.
Cause of death: suffocation by mom hug.

19:31.964 --> 19:35.551
Harriet, come with me.
I have something to show you.

19:41.765 --> 19:45.435
This is why I tell you,
"Never crack the spine of your books."

19:45.519 --> 19:48.397
Books are precious, treat them with love.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.440
These are all yours?

19:52.442 --> 19:54.486
This is where "Willa" came from.

19:54.570 --> 19:57.155
When I was a child,
I wanted to be a writer

19:57.239 --> 20:00.450
like the scribe of the Great Plains,
Willa Cather.

20:00.534 --> 20:02.452
So I changed my middle name to Willa.

20:03.537 --> 20:07.666
Wait, you wanted to be a writer,
Ole Golly? What happened?

20:07.749 --> 20:11.795
I just didn't have
the passion for it that you have.

20:11.879 --> 20:15.132
But I discovered that
I'm good at collecting books.

20:15.215 --> 20:18.677
And all these tomes are going to be
in my bookstore one day.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.721
And I'm going to call it, "Willa's."

20:21.513 --> 20:25.350
And guess whose first novel is going
to go in the window someday?

20:26.059 --> 20:29.605
Girls, before you go,
take some leftovers with you.

20:29.688 --> 20:32.357
I can't let these cannolis go to waste.

20:38.280 --> 20:42.242
Goodbye, my little Harriet Myrtle Welsch.

20:42.326 --> 20:45.537
Take care of my Catherine, all right?

20:45.621 --> 20:47.539
I will. Don't worry!

20:56.715 --> 20:58.634
You hate the name Myrtle, don't you?

20:58.717 --> 20:59.801
Yep.

21:00.886 --> 21:02.054
I knew it.

21:02.804 --> 21:05.349
At first, I just took it to stop you two
from fighting.

21:05.432 --> 21:07.893
But I've been thinking about it,
and, well,

21:07.976 --> 21:11.438
Myrtle is part of you, so I'm keeping it.

21:11.522 --> 21:15.692
So, you're going to go by
"Harriet Myrtle Welsch" from now on?

21:15.776 --> 21:17.861
Absolutely not. Are you kidding me?

21:17.945 --> 21:20.280
I'm staying Harriet "M, period" Welsch.

21:20.364 --> 21:24.117
But now I'll always know
what the "M" stands for. Always.

21:24.201 --> 21:25.911
When you become a famous writer,

21:25.994 --> 21:28.455
people will find out
that you're actually a Myrtle.

21:29.873 --> 21:32.042
I don't care.
After what I've been through,

21:32.125 --> 21:34.753
I kinda figured out
that good writing makes a writer,

21:34.837 --> 21:35.879
not a good name.

21:42.594 --> 21:44.680
-What's wrong?
-I was just thinking,

21:44.763 --> 21:47.558
if you're going to
open a bookstore someday,

21:47.641 --> 21:50.435
I guess you're not going
to be my nanny forever.

21:51.562 --> 21:54.147
Yes, Harriet. I will leave one day.

21:54.231 --> 21:57.568
But don't worry,
we'll always be connected.

21:57.651 --> 22:01.488
After all, we both share
the story of "M," don't we?

22:01.572 --> 22:02.698
We're family now.

22:03.365 --> 22:08.620
It's a good story. Also,
we left the cannolis on the train.

22:18.589 --> 22:21.341
So anyway,
I forgave my mom and dad.

22:21.425 --> 22:26.597
Like Ole Golly said, we all make mistakes,
even parents. Especially parents.

22:26.680 --> 22:30.517
And mistakes give you great stories.

22:33.061 --> 22:35.147
I started mine with a scribble…

22:37.274 --> 22:39.735
which turned into an "M" question mark,

22:39.818 --> 22:45.157
then finished off the story
with an "M" period.

22:46.742 --> 22:49.411
I just wanna be
You just wanna be

22:49.494 --> 22:51.163
We just wanna be

22:52.289 --> 22:54.833
I don't wanna be
You don't wanna be

22:54.917 --> 23:00.422
We don't wanna be told what to do

23:02.591 --> 23:08.263
And I try my best to do good
In the neighborhood

23:08.347 --> 23:10.807
I smile real nice

23:10.891 --> 23:14.102
And I strive to tell the truth

23:14.186 --> 23:16.688
I just wanna be
You just wanna be

23:16.772 --> 23:18.607
We just wanna be

23:19.483 --> 23:22.236
I don't wanna be
You don't wanna be

23:22.319 --> 23:25.072
We don't wanna be told what to do

23:25.155 --> 23:27.658
I am gonna be who I wanna be

23:27.741 --> 23:29.660
My autonomy

23:30.369 --> 23:33.163
I just wanna be
You just wanna be

23:33.247 --> 23:35.165
We just wanna be

23:35.249 --> 23:38.001
No, I won't cut my hair

23:38.085 --> 23:40.671
And I'll wear whatever

23:40.754 --> 23:46.343
I like it when I get to be myself

23:46.426 --> 23:49.263
I don't wanna be
You don't wanna be

23:49.346 --> 23:54.059
We don't wanna be told what to do
