[cheerful music]

00:04.171 --> 00:10.075
â™ª

00:11.478 --> 00:13.078
- Hey.
I feel so lucky

00:13.080 --> 00:15.080
We're in the same city
for valentine's day.

00:15.082 --> 00:16.415
- It's like magic.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.283
Or it's like me
getting on my hands and knees

00:18.285 --> 00:20.686
And begging my partners to
switch a Tuesday for a Thursday.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.421
- Alakazam.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.490
- By the way, they do need
an extra day next week.

00:24.492 --> 00:26.792
- And poof, he disappears.

00:26.794 --> 00:28.127
- [snaps]

00:28.129 --> 00:29.728
- Hey.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.263
Wanna play hooky today?

00:31.265 --> 00:33.665
- Oh, maybe.
What do you got in mind?

00:33.667 --> 00:35.300
- We can do
anything you want.

00:35.302 --> 00:37.136
I really wanna
have fun today,

00:37.138 --> 00:39.705
Because tomorrow
is going to be a nightmare.

00:39.707 --> 00:43.275
Andy's coming back
from his stupid, dumb boat trip.

00:43.277 --> 00:45.677
He's been rude,
he's been selfish,

00:45.679 --> 00:49.348
I think he's a big jerk,
and I'm breaking up with him.

00:49.350 --> 00:53.685
Bam, andy!
How do ya like me now?

00:53.687 --> 00:55.354
I hope as a friend.

00:55.356 --> 00:59.691
- Erin says she's gonna break up
with andy, but I'm not sure.

00:59.693 --> 01:02.161
He's coming back tomorrow,
and surprise,

01:02.163 --> 01:04.663
Today she wants to do
whatever I'd like.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.232
You know, when I was a kid
we had a dog who got real sick,

01:07.234 --> 01:10.302
And we had to
send him to a farm.

01:10.304 --> 01:14.373
And on his last day,
we did everything he loved.

01:14.375 --> 01:17.342
- [gasps]

01:17.344 --> 01:18.777
- [chuckles]

01:18.779 --> 01:22.347
- Wanna play catch
in the parking lot?

01:22.349 --> 01:23.749
- Sure.
- Great.

01:23.751 --> 01:27.419
- Get my coat.
- Perfect.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.188
- [knocks]
[murmurs] come in.

01:29.190 --> 01:31.290
Andy, hi, I just made
another huge sale

01:31.292 --> 01:32.624
For the company
that you manage,

01:32.626 --> 01:34.860
So I need you to authorize
that expense report

01:34.862 --> 01:37.229
And sign off
on that contract.

01:37.231 --> 01:38.430
I would be happy to.

01:38.432 --> 01:41.433
It would be
my pleasure, mr. Schrute.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.703
Rink-a-dit doo, rika-doot-deet
doo, rika-deet-doo.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.472
I really like andy
these days.

01:46.474 --> 01:49.541
He's pretend, and he does
exactly as I tell him to.

01:49.543 --> 01:53.145
All that will change when
real andy comes back tomorrow.

01:53.147 --> 01:56.248
Unless he comes back
as pretend dwight.

01:56.250 --> 02:01.753
We're in for an epic,
confusing showdown.

02:01.755 --> 02:05.824
- Andy left a carton of milk
in the fridge,

02:05.826 --> 02:08.360
So I've been
sneaking a little bit

02:08.362 --> 02:10.362
Every day
for the last three months.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.231
It's been yummy.

02:12.233 --> 02:15.634
But now andy's coming back.

02:15.636 --> 02:20.639
So, I guess it's
good-bye, chunky lemon milk.

02:20.641 --> 02:24.143
Okay, I'll say it.

02:24.145 --> 02:26.345
I wish andy had stayed
on his trip.

02:26.347 --> 02:30.682
- I say we all have
one last fun, boss-less day.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.918
- Yeah, let's get some booze
and some cocaine

02:32.920 --> 02:35.387
And just blow it out,
no consequences.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.222
- Or the mini-mall.

02:37.224 --> 02:38.690
They have all these
valentine day deals.

02:38.692 --> 02:41.193
And you get 20% off
if you come in

02:41.195 --> 02:43.162
With your husband
or your boyfriend.

02:43.164 --> 02:45.364
But I mean, if you don't
have one of those,

02:45.366 --> 02:46.932
You can probably
just bring

02:46.934 --> 02:49.368
Whoever it is you use
to kill your loneliness.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.537
- Phyll, I'll pretend
to be your husband.

02:51.539 --> 02:54.606
I'm already sick of you,
so it'll seem realistic.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.808
- Oh...
- They have a nail salon there

02:56.810 --> 02:58.677
Where I get my feet detailed.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.380
They use a watch repair kit.

03:01.382 --> 03:02.347
- Ooh!

03:02.349 --> 03:03.949
I'll be your foot buddy.

03:03.951 --> 03:06.385
- Everyone, it is our last day
here with no manager.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.886
I say we go
to the mini-mall.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.755
Clark, you will be
my fake boyfriend

03:09.757 --> 03:13.225
So I can get the discount.
- That's what I do.

03:13.227 --> 03:15.294
- Let's do it.

03:17.363 --> 03:19.198
- Darryl, everyone
seems to be pairing off.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.832
Do you want to pretend to be
a couple so we get the...

03:20.834 --> 03:22.968
- No.

03:22.970 --> 03:26.538
Yes. Yes. Why wouldn't I?

03:26.540 --> 03:29.308
I wanna pretend to be gay.
I got no problem with that.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.610
- All right, it'll be easy.
Don't be nervous, just follow--

03:31.612 --> 03:34.613
- Stop talking about it.
I said I'm fine with it.

03:34.615 --> 03:35.747
- These are gross.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.516
- They are terrible.

03:37.518 --> 03:39.585
- Oh, hey, don't fill up
on chocolates.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.887
I made us a lunch reservation
at state street grill.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.723
- Oh, my god.
That's so romantic.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.258
- It's with
brian and alyssa.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.594
- Oh, my god,
that's less romantic.

03:48.596 --> 03:51.330
- I know,
but we should go.

03:51.332 --> 03:54.266
We need to thank him
for, you know, saving my life.

03:54.268 --> 03:58.770
- Yeah, yeah, no, totally.
That's good.

03:58.772 --> 04:02.808
So should we just get a bottle
of wine later and celebrate?

04:02.810 --> 04:04.376
- That sounds nice.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.245
- I'm very excited
to see brian.

04:06.247 --> 04:07.980
Brian's a great guy,

04:07.982 --> 04:11.683
To he and his wife alyssa
over the years, and...

04:11.685 --> 04:13.485
He got fired
for protecting my wife

04:13.487 --> 04:15.954
From a jerk
in the warehouse.

04:15.956 --> 04:20.492
I'm sorry, but you know him.
He's a good guy.

04:20.494 --> 04:23.829
- Oh, tiny foot lady
is back.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.530
- Oh...

04:25.532 --> 04:26.965
- Oh, get the baby clipper.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.667
- [gasps]
- oh, so cute.

04:28.669 --> 04:32.337
[excited chatter]

04:33.706 --> 04:35.674
- You take off
your glasses.

04:35.676 --> 04:38.677
- Okay.

04:38.679 --> 04:41.313
- [giggles]

04:41.315 --> 04:45.317
- Your boyfriend.
He look like a pretty girl.

04:45.319 --> 04:48.854
- My boyfriend does look like
a pretty girl, doesn't he?

04:48.856 --> 04:51.023
Yes, a very little
pretty girl.

04:51.025 --> 04:53.058
And you know what?
I think you are developing.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.960
We should go
and get you a training bra.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.361
- [giggles]

04:56.363 --> 05:00.032
- Oh, you guys
both think this is funny?

05:00.034 --> 05:03.068
- Well, you know what?
No more discount.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.569
Excuse me!
- What? Shush!

05:04.571 --> 05:05.671
- Full price.

05:05.673 --> 05:08.373
We're not together.
- Oh, come on.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.008
- She's living a lie.

05:10.010 --> 05:13.712
- Turns out I can't even
be in a pretend relationship.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.747
- Hi. We'd like
the couples discount

05:15.749 --> 05:17.082
On a pair
of foot massages.

05:17.084 --> 05:20.319
- No, no discount
for two men.

05:20.321 --> 05:21.520
Two men are not a couple.

05:21.522 --> 05:24.323
- We are together,
romantically.

05:24.325 --> 05:25.791
- Two men.

05:25.793 --> 05:29.061
- [speaking korean]

05:29.063 --> 05:32.998
- [scoffs, laughs]
doesn't work. No discount.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.467
- Oh, it works.

05:35.469 --> 05:38.337
Him and me, all right,
we are crazy in love.

05:38.339 --> 05:40.939
More in love than your
small mind can comprehend.

05:40.941 --> 05:44.042
And we have two disposable
incomes and no kids,

05:44.044 --> 05:46.044
And we're taking
our business elsewhere.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.013
- [softly]
oh...

05:49.916 --> 05:51.983
- [exhales]

05:57.390 --> 05:58.390
- Hey.
- Hey, brian.

05:58.392 --> 05:59.858
- Hey.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.560
- Sorry we're late.

06:01.562 --> 06:04.096
- Oh, uh, no problem.
I finished all the bread.

06:04.098 --> 06:05.897
- Oh.
- [laughs] yeah, okay.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.099
- What?

06:07.101 --> 06:08.633
- He's on a no-carb thing,
supposedly.

06:08.635 --> 06:09.735
- Oh.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.069
- [sighs] it's great
to see you guys.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.404
Thanks for coming.

06:12.406 --> 06:13.472
- Yeah.
- Are you kidding?

06:13.474 --> 06:15.040
Thank you, man, I mean,

06:15.042 --> 06:17.142
I've wanted the opportunity
to say thanks for...

06:17.144 --> 06:19.778
Everything, and I'm really
sorry about the job.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.012
That just seems crazy.

06:21.014 --> 06:25.450
But if you guys know of
any work, I'm fully available.

06:25.452 --> 06:27.486
- Well, my dad
can't hear a thing.

06:27.488 --> 06:28.954
You could boom
his whole life for him.

06:28.956 --> 06:31.490
- That--okay, great.
Does he pay well?

06:31.492 --> 06:33.592
- [laughs]
where's alyssa?

06:33.594 --> 06:35.727
- Uh, yeah.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.130
Um, you know, alyssa's--
she's not gonna make it today.

06:38.132 --> 06:39.598
- Oh.

06:39.600 --> 06:43.735
- Actually,
we're not gonna make it.

06:43.737 --> 06:47.105
We're splitting up.

06:47.107 --> 06:51.042
- I have yet another
sales order for you to sign.

06:51.044 --> 06:54.713
Why, thank you, mr. Schrute.
I don't know how you do it.

06:54.715 --> 06:55.981
You're a god.

06:55.983 --> 06:59.918
Rink-a-dink,
deet, deet, doo.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.187
- Hi, dwight.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.156
- You're back.

07:04.158 --> 07:07.092
And you're disgusting.

07:09.862 --> 07:12.964
- Aw, jeez,
my nails aren't dry yet.

07:12.966 --> 07:15.000
I don't think I can work
for at least a couple hours.

07:15.002 --> 07:17.903
- Well, well, well,
look who it is.

07:17.905 --> 07:21.006
- I guess I can cancel
my order from zappos.Com

07:21.008 --> 07:23.942
Because, oh,
the loafers have arrived.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.044
- Andy.
- Hey! Sweetheart!

07:26.046 --> 07:29.014
I missed you so much.

07:29.016 --> 07:33.885
- Yes. Oh.
Welcome back, buddy.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.620
- I have been dreaming
of this moment.

07:35.622 --> 07:38.223
- Me too. So much.
I'm so happy.

07:38.225 --> 07:41.626
I am really,
really bad at breakups.

07:41.628 --> 07:44.596
Technically, I'm still dating
my first-grade boyfriend.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.731
I mean, we just had
our 20th anniversary.

07:46.733 --> 07:49.067
And I forgot
to get him something.

07:49.069 --> 07:51.636
- What happened? We thought
you were coming back tomorrow.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.839
- Well, valentine's surprise
for erin.

07:53.841 --> 07:55.640
Hello. Super romantic.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.075
And I got you something.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.978
Oh, it's a couple of pieces
of bamboo, big deal, right?

07:59.980 --> 08:01.847
No, these are
musical instruments.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.782
It's so we can play
island music together.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.851
'cause I have this.

08:05.853 --> 08:08.687
[rhythmic beat]

08:08.689 --> 08:09.754
Clop the cloppers.

08:09.756 --> 08:11.056
Yeah, clop 'em.
[both playing]

08:11.058 --> 08:13.992
It's called bembe.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.627
â™ª yoruba yoruba

08:15.629 --> 08:17.128

08:19.032 --> 08:21.233
- â™ª aruba raruba

08:21.235 --> 08:23.568
- Hey, burning man, if it's not
selling out too much,

08:23.570 --> 08:24.936
You might wanna
throw on a tie.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.972
David wallace is gonna
be here in an hour.

08:26.974 --> 08:29.007
- Obviously,
that's why I'm here.

08:29.009 --> 08:32.711
I mean, I came back early
to surprise erin.

08:32.713 --> 08:34.713
Happy valentine's day,
sweetheart.

08:34.715 --> 08:35.881
- But I'm just saying

08:35.883 --> 08:36.882
I'm also excited
about the wallace meeting.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.083
- Why?

08:38.085 --> 08:39.718
Isn't he just coming in
to rip you a new one

08:39.720 --> 08:40.952
For being gone
three months?

08:40.954 --> 08:42.621
- No, please,
come on, clark.

08:42.623 --> 08:45.790
Wallace knows that he's been
gone for the last three months.

08:45.792 --> 08:46.992
Right?

08:46.994 --> 08:49.261
Wallace does know

08:49.263 --> 08:51.096
That you've been gone
for the last three months?

08:51.098 --> 08:53.598
- I have no idea. I don't know
what he knows or doesn't know.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.033
But we've been in touch
the whole time.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.702
I mean, it's not hard
to get high-speed internet

08:57.704 --> 08:59.204
In turks and caicos,
people.

08:59.206 --> 09:02.073
It's in every bembe cafe.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.242
- He only emailed me
four times.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.211
- Question. Where's jim?

09:06.213 --> 09:08.747
- He and pam are having
their valentine's day lunch.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.215
- For two hours, really?

09:10.217 --> 09:12.083
- So, you're concerned

09:12.085 --> 09:15.086
About peoples' long absence
from their place of work.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.588
- If the shoe fits...

09:18.725 --> 09:22.227
- We were telling two different
versions of the same story,

09:22.229 --> 09:25.096
And then everything
just went numb.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.098
- Well, I mean,
that's okay.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.300
It doesn't mean
that it's over, right?

09:28.302 --> 09:30.035
I mean, couples fight.

09:30.037 --> 09:31.169
- Yeah,
and that's the thing.

09:31.171 --> 09:34.606
It weirdly felt like the
relationship was still alive.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.775
And it wasn't until
we stopped fighting

09:36.777 --> 09:41.046
That we realized
it was over.

09:41.048 --> 09:44.883
It's over.

09:44.885 --> 09:48.620
I'm sorry, this is--
oh, my god, okay.

09:48.622 --> 09:51.089
We have to stop
seeing each other like this.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.958
Uh, we have to find a different
way to communicate

09:52.960 --> 09:54.626
Other than breaking down
in front of each other.

09:54.628 --> 09:57.996
- Yeah.
- What?

09:57.998 --> 10:01.032
- At least my crying
won't get you fired.

10:04.036 --> 10:07.072
- Crying?

10:07.074 --> 10:10.342
- I notice that you landed the
scranton white pages account.

10:10.344 --> 10:12.110
That is tremendous.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.312
And you sold it
to jan, too, I mean...

10:14.314 --> 10:15.914
- Yes.
[laughs]

10:15.916 --> 10:18.016
- I'm impressed.
- [laughs]

10:18.018 --> 10:21.119
- Well, there's one problem.
Couldn't help but notice

10:21.121 --> 10:26.691
So, gotta run that stuff
by me, dwight.

10:26.693 --> 10:27.959
- You were on a boat.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.327
- I was...

10:29.329 --> 10:32.631
- On a boat in the ocean.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.966
- Okay, the issue is that you
need to run this stuff by me.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.701
Coolio?

10:36.703 --> 10:39.938
Are we coolio?

10:39.940 --> 10:42.007
Just say the word "coolio."
- I'm not gonna say it.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.008
- Say it.
- Not a word.

10:43.010 --> 10:43.975
- Coolio.
- No.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.744
[dial tone sounds]

10:45.746 --> 10:48.313
- Just gonna call
the scranton white pages

10:48.315 --> 10:49.748
And clear this right up.
- Don't you dare, andy.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.282
[phone line rings]
- hello?

10:51.284 --> 10:53.385
- Oh...
- Hey, jan. Nard dog here.

10:53.387 --> 10:55.086
- Oh, andy...

10:55.088 --> 10:58.089
I found a little hiccup.
- Really?

10:58.091 --> 10:59.991
- Yeah, it appears my employee
offered you a price

10:59.993 --> 11:02.127
That he was not
authorized to.

11:02.129 --> 11:03.128
- Hmm.
- Coolio.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.863
- Seriously?

11:04.865 --> 11:06.665
You're calling me a few weeks
after finalizing our contract

11:06.667 --> 11:08.199
To gouge me now
for more money?

11:08.201 --> 11:11.102
- No, no, no, jan,
I think you misunderstood.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.303
- Yeah.
- I'm coolio.

11:12.305 --> 11:13.405
- It's--it's actually
just an issue--

11:13.407 --> 11:15.874
- You know what,
uh, nard dog?

11:15.876 --> 11:18.209
There is an option
in the contract

11:18.211 --> 11:21.446
That allows me to back out
within 30 days of signing,

11:21.448 --> 11:24.215
So I would like
to exercise that option.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.217
- No, jan, please do not
listen to this boob!

11:26.219 --> 11:29.120
Remember clark. He gave you
everything. Everything.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.388
- Jan, I don't know
what he's talking about, but--

11:30.390 --> 11:32.290
- Tell angela to send me
a final invoice.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.291
- Uh--
[click, dial tone]

11:33.293 --> 11:36.928
- Please, ja--ja--
- ooh...

11:36.930 --> 11:37.996
Oh...

11:37.998 --> 11:40.965
That was not...

11:40.967 --> 11:44.035
How I had hoped
that would go.

11:47.339 --> 11:49.007
- Hey, everybody,
great job.

11:49.009 --> 11:52.944
Listen, we're a smidge behind
on my paychecks.

11:52.946 --> 11:55.914
- Yes, well, as you know,
we get paid on fridays.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.850
And you haven't been here
for 12 fridays.

11:58.852 --> 12:01.252
- All right.
Thank you very much.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.455
Looking good.

12:03.457 --> 12:05.056
Who's that little fella?

12:05.058 --> 12:08.960
- It's a bonus check
for you from wallace.

12:08.962 --> 12:11.930
Because the branch exceeded its
targets over the past quarter.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.998
- Wow, that's wonderful.
- Quarter's three months.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.734
That's how long
you've been gone.

12:15.736 --> 12:16.735
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

12:16.737 --> 12:17.802
- Mm-hmm.

12:19.772 --> 12:20.872
Mm-hmm.

12:20.874 --> 12:23.842
Thank you.

12:23.844 --> 12:28.179
Great, well,
we're all up to speed.

12:31.817 --> 12:33.752
- Two seconds
of the turd dog,

12:33.754 --> 12:35.954
And he loses the biggest sale
this branch has ever seen.

12:35.956 --> 12:37.422
- Do you have any idea
what I had to do

12:37.424 --> 12:39.824
To get that sale from jan?

12:39.826 --> 12:44.529
All out. I mean like everything
was out the whole week.

12:44.531 --> 12:47.098
- He just waltzes
back in here

12:47.100 --> 12:49.400
Like he owns
the chunky lemon milk.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.002
Who needs him, right?

12:51.004 --> 12:52.871
- God, I just don't know
what we do.

12:52.873 --> 12:55.440
I mean, short of
telling david wallace

12:55.442 --> 12:57.442
That he was gone
for three months...

12:57.444 --> 12:59.778
I'd like to rat out andy,
but unfortunately I have

12:59.780 --> 13:02.947
A bit of a "boy who cried wolf"
dynamic with david wallace.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.183
Except instead of
a boy I'm a man,

13:05.185 --> 13:08.286
And instead of a wolf,
I cried,

13:08.288 --> 13:11.523
"genetically-engineered
monster wolf."

13:11.525 --> 13:14.993
- I'm not gonna rat on him.
Andy gave me a second chance.

13:14.995 --> 13:17.996
So the least I could do
is let somebody else rat on him.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.364
Meredith, why don't you?

13:19.366 --> 13:22.467
- Meredith palmer ain't never
been called no narc.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.469
Floozy? Yes.
Alkie? Check.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.404
Einstein sarcastically?
You bet.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.339
But never no narc.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.942
Vomit mop? Sure.
Floor meat? That's me.

13:30.944 --> 13:31.943
Flesh hoover? Hi.
- Hey--

13:31.945 --> 13:34.078
- Meredith, that's plenty.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.447
All right?
That's more than plenty.

13:36.449 --> 13:38.249
Why does no one stop her?

13:38.251 --> 13:41.319
- Guys, I know that a lot
of people are mad at andy,

13:41.321 --> 13:42.921
And believe me, I am too.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.856
But he has been
through a lot,

13:44.858 --> 13:46.991
And we all used to
love him, right?

13:46.993 --> 13:49.093
So, if he's gonna
get in trouble,

13:49.095 --> 13:50.495
Just let it be his fault,
not ours.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.864
I don't want that
on my hands.

13:52.866 --> 13:56.334
The state he's in, wallace will
take one look at him

13:56.336 --> 14:00.271
And probably
fire him anyway.

14:00.273 --> 14:04.609
- What's going on in here,
dirty players?

14:04.611 --> 14:06.845
Let's get back to bustin'
some paper rhymes.

14:06.847 --> 14:08.213
Come on.

14:08.215 --> 14:10.481
â™ª who's that girl?

14:10.483 --> 14:12.183
â™ª who's that girl?

14:12.185 --> 14:14.385
It's andy.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.888
[chuckles]

14:16.890 --> 14:21.092
All right. [snaps]
back to work.

14:24.396 --> 14:26.397
- Okay, I can tell
you're mad at me.

14:26.399 --> 14:30.568
Do you wanna just, um,
I don't know, tell me why?

14:30.570 --> 14:34.272
- I don't know.

14:36.108 --> 14:39.010
I thought that was
a little weird.

14:39.012 --> 14:42.614
You told me brian got fired
for the whole warehouse thing.

14:42.616 --> 14:44.482
And you intentionally
left out

14:44.484 --> 14:49.454
A kind of major
intimate detail.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.956
I don't know, pam, I guess
I just feel like a chump...

14:51.958 --> 14:54.926
Who knows less about
his marriage than the sound guy.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.895
- I didn't tell you
about the crying

14:56.897 --> 14:59.931
Because I didn't want you
to know how upset I was.

14:59.933 --> 15:02.033
Because it would've
stressed you out,

15:02.035 --> 15:04.669
And you're always saying how
much you don't want more stress.

15:04.671 --> 15:09.007
- Yeah, well, yeah, okay.
Well, then thank you.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.142
Thanks to both of you.

15:11.144 --> 15:12.944
- It's not brian's fault.
- No, you're right.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.646
And I'm not mad at brian.

15:14.648 --> 15:18.583
Any reason to be mad at all
because I wasn't there.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.418
So let's just
forget about it.

15:20.420 --> 15:23.588
- Okay.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.323
- [sighs]

15:25.325 --> 15:28.026
All the highlights
from the last three months

15:28.028 --> 15:33.164
Just a few things I could
sprinkle into conversation.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.233
Any big sales
or office gossip?

15:35.235 --> 15:38.236
- Well, we had
the scranton white pages.

15:38.238 --> 15:40.071
- Not helpful.
Let's stay positive, people.

15:40.073 --> 15:42.240
Okay?
- Hey, guys.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.942
- Hey, david, how are ya?

15:43.944 --> 15:45.677
We were just having
our weekly round table

15:45.679 --> 15:47.712
Where we motivate
each other.

15:47.714 --> 15:50.181
I'm not gonna lie--I get
as much out of it as they do.

15:50.183 --> 15:52.016
- Sounds great.
Don't let me interrupt.

15:52.018 --> 15:53.718
Whatever you guys have been
doing this last quarter,

15:53.720 --> 15:55.720
I couldn't be happier
with the numbers.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.522
- Thank you.
- Well, finish up.

15:57.524 --> 16:00.692
And you and I
will talk in 15 minutes?

16:00.694 --> 16:03.695
- Great.
- Great job, everybody!

16:03.697 --> 16:05.430
- [quietly] we had to let
a warehouse guy go?

16:05.432 --> 16:08.333
- You know pam's mural?
Well, frank--

16:08.335 --> 16:11.703
- Lit the whole thing on fire.
It was crazy.

16:11.705 --> 16:13.237
- What?
- Yeah.

16:13.239 --> 16:14.672
- There was a fire
in the warehouse?

16:14.674 --> 16:17.709
Fire department was here.
It was in all the papers.

16:17.711 --> 16:18.977
- Oh...

16:18.979 --> 16:21.045
- This is what
I'm talking about.

16:21.047 --> 16:23.514
This would be good to know.
All right, what else?

16:23.516 --> 16:25.984
- We started
selling balloons.

16:25.986 --> 16:27.251
- What?
- Yeah.

16:27.253 --> 16:29.220
And, uh, kathy ireland
signed on

16:29.222 --> 16:31.322
As the official spokesbabe
of dunder mifflin.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.690
- No kidding.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.058
- Yeah,
in the european billboards,

16:34.060 --> 16:35.360
She's gonna be topless.
- [chuckles] wow.

16:35.362 --> 16:38.396
Go, kathy.
She's like 50.

16:38.398 --> 16:41.132
- They're tasteful.
- Good, good. What else?

16:43.336 --> 16:46.771
And thank god, right? We needed
the income after the fire.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.539
- What fire?

16:48.541 --> 16:51.476
- The warehouse fire.
Weren't you just down there?

16:51.478 --> 16:53.411
It's like burnt to ashes.

16:53.413 --> 16:58.449
- It looked fine to me.

16:59.752 --> 17:02.687
- I am speaking metaphorically,
of course.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.522
You know I have
lots of irons

17:04.524 --> 17:07.325
In the "fire."
- mm-hmm.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.427
- Well, that's one of 'em,
you know.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.729
Making sure that
the warehouse logistics

17:11.731 --> 17:16.034
Is a well-oiled,
properly-stoked fire.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.735
- Okay.

17:17.737 --> 17:20.471
- Think you'll agree
I explained that pretty well.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.807
- Thanks, andy.
- Thank you.

17:22.809 --> 17:25.576
- All right. Everyone.

17:32.451 --> 17:34.419
[rhythmic sounds]

17:34.421 --> 17:36.788
- The fish sounds great.

17:36.790 --> 17:38.489
- Yeah, I guess.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.324
- Really playing
the scales, huh?

17:40.326 --> 17:43.227
It just sort of sounds like
noise to me now.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.228
You think I need
a new fish?

17:44.230 --> 17:45.396
- I don't love you anymore.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.798
- What?
- I still like you.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.333
But you were gone
a really long time,

17:49.335 --> 17:51.402
And you didn't really
email me all that much.

17:51.404 --> 17:55.073
You re-tweeted me a lot,
to be fair.

17:55.075 --> 17:56.541
But I don't love you.

17:56.543 --> 17:58.476
- Okay, I get it.

17:58.478 --> 18:00.611
You're unhappy.
I've been gone a long time,

18:00.613 --> 18:02.480
And we lost
a little bit of juju,

18:02.482 --> 18:04.382
But you and me,
we have a future.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.517
There is a lot
of love here.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.286
- I just said
there isn't love.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.321
- On your side.

18:10.323 --> 18:13.424
But there's tons on my side.
It's gushing.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.126
We're just outta sync
right now.

18:15.128 --> 18:17.261
But that's just timing,
and what's timing?

18:17.263 --> 18:19.730
I mean, my parents
lasted 30, 40 years.

18:19.732 --> 18:21.532
They were never happy
at the same time.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.401
- I guess.

18:23.403 --> 18:24.602
- I mean,
what do we have left?

18:24.604 --> 18:28.306
35, maybe 40 years,
if we're lucky?

18:28.308 --> 18:29.874
I mean, I have spent
a lot of time in the sun.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.409
- You got really sunburned.

18:31.411 --> 18:33.478
- I'm gonna be a prune
in like three years.

18:33.480 --> 18:37.615
- I know you may not be
feeling love for me right now,

18:37.617 --> 18:39.517
But if you fake it,

18:39.519 --> 18:41.853
I won't be able
to tell the difference.

18:41.855 --> 18:43.321
So I'll feel good.

18:43.323 --> 18:45.523
And then eventually,
maybe,

18:45.525 --> 18:47.825
You'll actually
start to love me again.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.627
- You really think
we can get that back?

18:49.629 --> 18:52.130
- Yes.

18:53.365 --> 18:56.134
Come on.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.536
Totally.

19:05.245 --> 19:09.347
Maybe we should cancel
that bottle of wine tonight.

19:09.349 --> 19:10.548
- Oh?

19:10.550 --> 19:12.150
- Yeah, I just feel like

19:12.152 --> 19:13.751
I got a bunch of stuff to do
in philly,

19:13.753 --> 19:17.355
And I'm sure you have
stuff to do, so we can just...

19:17.357 --> 19:20.424
Drop me
at the bus station?

19:20.426 --> 19:23.661
- I just feel like
we're gonna fight.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.363
- Yeah.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.832
- So...

19:27.834 --> 19:29.233
How 'bout let's not?

19:29.235 --> 19:31.936
- Okay.

19:33.705 --> 19:38.342
- Oh, um...

19:38.344 --> 19:41.212
Happy valentine's day.

19:41.214 --> 19:46.284
Sorry. I didn't
have time to wrap it.

19:47.886 --> 19:51.222
- Wow.
I didn't know you kept this.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.391
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Thank you.

19:53.393 --> 19:56.460
- No problem.

19:59.631 --> 20:02.500
- I don't think you should
go to philly tonight.

20:02.502 --> 20:06.204
I think that you should stay,
and I think we should fight.

20:06.206 --> 20:09.540
- You really want to fight
on valentine's day?

20:09.542 --> 20:11.709
- Yeah, I do.

20:15.314 --> 20:17.315
- Okay.

20:17.317 --> 20:19.417
All right,
put your dukes up, beesly.

20:23.422 --> 20:24.789
- Hi.

20:24.791 --> 20:28.226
- Hey, you okay?

20:28.228 --> 20:31.429
- I couldn't do it.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.331
- Oh.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.899
- I'm sorry.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.534
- Oh, you don't
have to apologize.

20:36.536 --> 20:41.505
I just--I just want you
to be happy, okay?

20:51.416 --> 20:53.818
[chuckles]

20:58.557 --> 21:00.658
- We're breaking up.

21:02.594 --> 21:04.395
And just so you know,

21:04.397 --> 21:06.397
I was worried
that you were dead.

21:06.399 --> 21:10.034
You were gone
for three months.

21:12.304 --> 21:16.407
- Andy? David. Still here.

21:16.409 --> 21:19.477
What was that
about three months?
