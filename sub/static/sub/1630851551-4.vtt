00:35.200 --> 00:37.320
Oh, here he comes - Mr Mop.

00:37.320 --> 00:39.600
I don't use a mop, as well you know.

00:39.600 --> 00:40.880
What are we looking at?

00:40.880 --> 00:43.600
The most boring bloodbath
I've ever seen.

00:43.600 --> 00:46.160
Posh old lady disturbs burglar.
He falls down the stairs

00:46.160 --> 00:48.120
and dies. Case closed.

00:48.120 --> 00:49.680
Didn't stretch the DC's expertise.

00:49.680 --> 00:51.160
Poor old girl, though.

00:51.160 --> 00:53.040
Oh, I wouldn't shed
too many tears for her.

00:53.040 --> 00:54.480
She's a pain in the arse. Tony!

00:54.480 --> 00:56.120
What have I told you? Sorry.

00:57.400 --> 00:59.720
He's right.
She's a pain in the arse.

00:59.720 --> 01:03.480
Get her precious floorboards clean,
and I'll aim to bring you
something more juicy next time.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.080
Yeah, just no blood on curtains.

01:05.080 --> 01:06.920
You've got a compulsion
to kill - fine.

01:06.920 --> 01:08.440
Do it in the bath!

01:08.440 --> 01:10.480
How come you weren't at Villa
on Saturday?

01:10.480 --> 01:12.600
Someone was sick in my shoes.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.600
Weasel? Of course Weasel.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.240
Why do you keep hanging out
with him?

01:16.240 --> 01:17.560
I don't hang out with him.

01:17.560 --> 01:20.560
I've been asking him to stop
following me since primary school.

01:20.560 --> 01:22.680
Took me ages to get 'em clean.

01:22.680 --> 01:24.560
Poor Mr Mop - always cleaning.

01:24.560 --> 01:26.320
I don't use a mop, though,
do I, Ruth?

01:26.320 --> 01:28.920
Oh, that's Sergeant Edwards,
if you don't mind.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.920
Hello?

01:39.920 --> 01:41.560
Hello, it's Wicky from Lausen.

01:41.560 --> 01:44.440
Who? Lausen, the cleaning company.

01:44.440 --> 01:45.720
The police sent us.

01:45.720 --> 01:48.760
Well, you're not the charming
elderly gentleman I spoke to.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.920
No, that's the boss. He sent me.

01:50.920 --> 01:52.800
Although,
when it comes to charm, I...

01:52.800 --> 01:53.960
And you are?

01:53.960 --> 01:55.120
Wicky.

01:55.120 --> 01:57.080
And that's on your
birth certificate, is it?

01:57.080 --> 01:59.880
Sorry, Paul Wickstead.
It's Wicky for short.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.160
ID, please.

02:03.880 --> 02:05.200
Step back!

02:05.200 --> 02:07.640
It's not a wide-angled lens, man!

02:07.640 --> 02:08.960
Jesus. Sorry, Nana.

02:08.960 --> 02:11.400
Did you call me Nana?

02:11.400 --> 02:13.400
No. You did.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.800
You called me Nana.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.400
Perhaps you'd like to meet Saltren.

02:17.400 --> 02:18.920
Kill him, Saltren!

02:18.920 --> 02:20.320
Bite to kill! Jesus!

02:20.320 --> 02:22.600
There's no need to set
a bloody dog on me. I'm only...

02:25.120 --> 02:27.680
I don't have a dog. You don't?

02:34.760 --> 02:37.400
Listen, I'm sorry
about the Nana thing.

02:37.400 --> 02:38.560
Boots off, please!

02:38.560 --> 02:40.120
Oh, I've got covers.

02:40.120 --> 02:41.760
Professionalism at last.

02:48.280 --> 02:51.200
That vase - how much
do you think it's worth?

02:51.200 --> 02:52.360
Pfft.

02:52.360 --> 02:53.800
200 quid.

02:53.800 --> 02:58.280
It was valued at auction at Â£20,000.

02:58.280 --> 03:00.680
Jesus Christ!
What's it doing in the hall?

03:00.680 --> 03:01.720
Exactly.

03:01.720 --> 03:05.600
This is not a house where
you may flail your arms around.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.640
In here, your movement
must be poised, thoughtful.

03:08.640 --> 03:11.520
You must be a heron.

03:11.520 --> 03:13.360
What must you be?

03:15.640 --> 03:16.680
A heron?

03:16.680 --> 03:18.320
A heron.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.680
So where did it happen?

03:37.680 --> 03:39.520
I'm kidding.
I can see it happened there.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.120
Sorry. Was it awful?

03:41.120 --> 03:42.360
It must have been awful.

03:42.360 --> 03:43.520
Devastating.

03:43.520 --> 03:46.080
Absolutely devastating.

03:46.080 --> 03:48.960
Oh, the...the footprints
are from my cat.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.320
She has been disciplined.

03:53.960 --> 03:55.720
Primarily surface-level staining.

03:55.720 --> 03:57.120
Original oak floorboards.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.720
I mean, they're more
porous than some,

03:58.720 --> 03:59.960
but not a disaster.

04:00.960 --> 04:03.320
Yeah, full restoration.
OK, this is a category six.

04:03.320 --> 04:04.960
A category six?

04:04.960 --> 04:06.440
Surface-level staining.

04:06.440 --> 04:08.080
You got off very lightly,
believe me.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.000
Yesterday was
a lump hammer killing

04:10.000 --> 04:12.320
in a head teacher's office.
I practically had to torch the gaff.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.320
Oh. No, this is fine.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.800
Don't you worry.

04:15.800 --> 04:18.720
By the end of the day,
it will be a distant memory

04:18.720 --> 04:21.960
that a man bled to death here,
in your home.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.240
To business.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.320
I'm sorry.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.840
I'm sorry, it must have been awful.

04:30.840 --> 04:33.280
It's a miracle that I survived.

04:33.280 --> 04:36.880
At first, I thought the noise
that woke me must be the cat.

04:36.880 --> 04:39.560
God knows, she's a heavy-footed
madam when she's tired.

04:39.560 --> 04:41.520
When I came to check...

04:43.800 --> 04:45.200
..there he was.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.320
He must have thought that I was...

04:48.320 --> 04:51.200
..I was out,
because he looked shocked.

04:51.200 --> 04:54.200
And that's when he took out
a knife...this big!

04:54.200 --> 04:55.840
Yikes.

04:55.840 --> 04:58.400
He pushed me into the chair
with such a force,

04:58.400 --> 05:00.520
I still feel like I've been skiing!

05:00.520 --> 05:02.320
God, skiing? Shit.

05:02.320 --> 05:05.840
And then he demanded to know
where the jewel safe was,

05:05.840 --> 05:08.600
and I was not going to reveal that.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.200
Hey! Now, that is silly.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.240
Jewellery's not worth dying for...

05:12.240 --> 05:14.480
..unless it's really nice jewellery.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.920
Yours is really nice jewellery,
isn't it?

05:16.920 --> 05:20.320
And that is exactly why
I feigned passing out.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.000
Clever girl.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.200
Sorry. Lady.

05:23.200 --> 05:24.640
Person. Go on.

05:24.640 --> 05:28.240
Well, I continued
to monitor him through one eye.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.680
Classic half-peep.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.520
Sounds like you played a blinder.

05:31.520 --> 05:32.880
Well, a peeper.

05:32.880 --> 05:34.680
Doesn't matter.
Peepy blinders. Go on.

05:34.680 --> 05:36.960
Well, I stealthily observed him

05:36.960 --> 05:39.520
lowering swag through the window,

05:39.520 --> 05:43.040
and he... Oh, I can barely
bring myself to say it.

05:44.560 --> 05:46.680
He was... Oh, it was monstrous!

05:46.680 --> 05:47.920
It was awful!

05:47.920 --> 05:49.480
Oh, God, what?

05:49.480 --> 05:52.680
He stood on the sofa!

05:54.240 --> 05:55.360
The cad!

05:55.360 --> 05:56.640
I leapt to my feet.

05:56.640 --> 05:58.080
"You!" I said.

05:58.080 --> 06:01.480
"You may break into my home
and rob my possessions,

06:01.480 --> 06:05.480
"but you will not stand
on that sofa in dirty shoes!"

06:05.480 --> 06:08.200
He must have put the knife away
and died of embarrassment.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.280
Quite the reverse.

06:10.280 --> 06:14.640
A smirk crept across
his dastardly lips.

06:14.640 --> 06:17.800
"This is what I think
about your chair,

06:17.800 --> 06:20.400
"you crumpled hag," he said.

06:20.400 --> 06:25.120
And with one swift,
awful movement, he did it.

06:26.440 --> 06:27.720
What, the rip?

06:27.720 --> 06:30.520
Well, as my grandson would say,

06:30.520 --> 06:32.360
I lost my shiz.

06:32.360 --> 06:35.280
You kicked him in the throat.
I threw a cushion at him.

06:35.280 --> 06:36.440
Also good.

06:36.440 --> 06:38.000
It was a heavy cushion?

06:38.000 --> 06:39.440
Well, he gave chase,

06:39.440 --> 06:43.400
following me
to the foot of the stairs.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.720
But I have maintained senior Pilates

06:45.720 --> 06:48.320
and am stronger
than he had bargained for.

06:50.040 --> 06:53.280
We grappled,
but he lost his footing.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.480
He grabbed at the shields,
the clubs,

06:55.480 --> 06:58.200
anything on the wall.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.800
No respect for any one of them.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.400
Then the die was cast.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.480
I watched him tumble,

07:04.480 --> 07:06.680
as if in a dream,

07:06.680 --> 07:09.000
his fall broken...

07:09.000 --> 07:11.080
..by his own head.

07:13.480 --> 07:14.720
Sheesh!

07:14.720 --> 07:17.800
The sound his neck made on impact

07:17.800 --> 07:19.840
will haunt me for life.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.680
It was like...

07:21.680 --> 07:23.400
Someone biting a Crunchie?

07:23.400 --> 07:26.080
A mighty oak finally succumbing
to the woodman's axe.

07:26.080 --> 07:27.560
Yeah, that's way better, yeah.

07:27.560 --> 07:31.840
I ran down to find him
gasping in lungfuls of air.

07:31.840 --> 07:34.800
He wasn't dead? I quickly arranged
him into the recovery position.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.200
Someone was a Brownie.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.560
I was a surgeon in the RAF!

07:38.560 --> 07:39.880
Yeah.

07:39.880 --> 07:42.480
I made him comfortable, but, alas,

07:42.480 --> 07:44.200
with a sickening gurgle...

07:46.080 --> 07:47.400
..he was gone.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.720
Well, I think it's pretty cool
that you even tried to help him.

07:51.720 --> 07:54.680
I have lived long enough
to know the right thing to do,

07:54.680 --> 07:56.080
young man. Ha!

07:56.080 --> 07:57.360
Next birthday...

07:58.760 --> 08:01.600
..I shall be 87 years of age.

08:01.600 --> 08:02.640
Right.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.360
You do not look 87.

08:08.760 --> 08:11.880
Oh, that silver tongue of yours
will get you anywhere.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.120
Right, I'd better get on.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.640
I have in mind you might care
for a pot of tea.

08:17.640 --> 08:20.040
I think I better earn it first,
don't you?

08:20.040 --> 08:22.960
And I'll start
by getting that taken away.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.520
What do you mean, taken away?

08:25.520 --> 08:27.160
Sorry, did you want it re-covered?

08:27.160 --> 08:29.600
Do you enjoy being

08:29.600 --> 08:31.320
an ignorant pig? Whoa!

08:32.320 --> 08:33.360
It's just a sofa.

08:37.200 --> 08:40.440
The Bulldog himself sat there.

08:40.440 --> 08:42.840
You're not talking about
a real dog, are you?

08:42.840 --> 08:45.560
Winston Churchill!

08:45.560 --> 08:46.960
Oh, him!

08:46.960 --> 08:49.080
Blimey, doesn't look like
it could take his weight.

08:49.080 --> 08:51.280
How dare you mock the great man!

08:51.280 --> 08:54.240
Well, I mean, he wasn't shy
at the buffet, was he?

08:54.240 --> 08:55.280
Sorry.

08:55.280 --> 08:57.280
Did you meet him?

08:57.280 --> 08:59.960
Fleetingly, as a small girl.

08:59.960 --> 09:01.840
My name is Vivien Hozier.

09:01.840 --> 09:05.200
I am a niece three times removed.

09:05.200 --> 09:07.960
My granny could get
her whole hand in her mouth.

09:07.960 --> 09:11.240
It has a rich history.

09:11.240 --> 09:14.000
Balfour smoked on this very sofa,

09:14.000 --> 09:16.360
Chamberlain sipped tea
from the colonies

09:16.360 --> 09:18.680
long before Winston faced

09:18.680 --> 09:20.440
that twisted Austrian. Who?

09:20.440 --> 09:21.600
Hitler.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.000
Hitler sat on it?

09:23.000 --> 09:24.360
Cool!

09:24.360 --> 09:26.720
Hitler did not sit on it,
for God's sake.

09:26.720 --> 09:29.200
It is a symbol of everything
that defeated him.

09:29.200 --> 09:33.920
When we heard that my father
had fallen in Normandy...

09:35.320 --> 09:39.800
I have mourned
on this very sofa!

09:39.800 --> 09:41.960
Right! I won't get it taken away.

09:41.960 --> 09:43.160
Hey...

09:45.640 --> 09:46.680
Sorry.

09:47.680 --> 09:49.680
My dad always said
I've got a smart mouth,

09:49.680 --> 09:51.160
but it's not connected to a brain.

09:52.440 --> 09:54.160
He made up a song about it,
actually.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.160
He's a terrible role model.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.160
You are a simple working man,

10:00.160 --> 10:02.120
I understand that.

10:02.120 --> 10:03.320
Yes. Yes.

10:03.320 --> 10:06.160
You just want to do your job
and get home.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.400
I'll do a good job.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.640
Probably can't even read or write.

10:09.640 --> 10:10.680
Hang on.

10:10.680 --> 10:14.640
Try and see this
as a piece of history,

10:14.640 --> 10:17.560
not somewhere to break wind
and watch television.

10:17.560 --> 10:19.080
Do you have a television?

10:19.080 --> 10:20.440
Yeah.

10:20.440 --> 10:22.480
Yeah, I'm going to get on.

10:23.800 --> 10:25.760
I shall warm the pot!

10:25.760 --> 10:27.520
How many sugars do you take?

10:27.520 --> 10:29.960
I don't take sugar. Oh...

10:44.760 --> 10:47.520
I must say I'm impressed.

10:47.520 --> 10:50.640
You work with devouement.

10:50.640 --> 10:53.560
I think you'll find
I work with acetone.

10:53.560 --> 10:56.000
Another little joke.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.520
Your job makes you happy.

10:57.520 --> 11:00.240
I like that. It's just a job.

11:03.520 --> 11:05.880
He really did bleed,
this bloke, didn't he?

11:05.880 --> 11:09.400
And would one...? Would one
have to train to be a...?

11:09.400 --> 11:11.600
A crime scene cleaner? Mm.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.880
Of course one would train.
Yes, of course.

11:13.880 --> 11:16.240
Well, you're a cut above
the woman who does the house.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.720
I mean, she can barely
dress herself.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.400
You like your little role,
don't you?

11:22.360 --> 11:24.720
Well, I wouldn't do it
if I didn't have to, but...

11:26.520 --> 11:28.240
..you do get to see how people live.

11:28.240 --> 11:31.040
I mean, I say live -
they're mainly horribly dead,

11:31.040 --> 11:34.280
but it's a taste of another life,
do you know what I mean?

11:36.480 --> 11:38.960
It sounds stupid, but...

11:38.960 --> 11:41.320
Well, go on.

11:41.320 --> 11:44.360
If someone's died
in their own home,

11:44.360 --> 11:47.000
I, uh, I like putting things
right for them.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.600
"Put things right." How noble.

11:49.600 --> 11:52.480
Well, better for things
to be left as they were

11:52.480 --> 11:54.720
in the happy times,
you know, before...

11:54.720 --> 11:57.080
Well, before their brains got
splattered all over the carpet.

11:57.080 --> 11:59.080
Oh, for God's sake, man. Sorry,

11:59.080 --> 12:01.480
but you be thankful
this one was fresh.

12:01.480 --> 12:03.680
If they've been left,
it can be rank.

12:03.680 --> 12:05.360
Rank? You don't want to know.

12:05.360 --> 12:08.680
Insects, bacteria - it's gross.

12:08.680 --> 12:10.160
There was one last week...

12:11.920 --> 12:14.640
I mean, the stench of decay
in that room,

12:14.640 --> 12:17.520
it was so heavy in the air,

12:17.520 --> 12:19.040
it was like...

12:19.040 --> 12:22.200
It was like my nan had farted
in my mouth.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.160
And she only ate ham.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.600
Oh, God. Don't worry.

12:25.600 --> 12:28.200
That's only when I do work
for the council, you know,

12:28.200 --> 12:30.160
with old people who've...

12:30.160 --> 12:33.320
Died a solitary death, huh?

12:33.320 --> 12:36.880
I'm sure you will live
for many years to come.

12:36.880 --> 12:41.120
I shall die at 93,
like all the rest of my family.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.720
Leave me your card.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.320
I should like you
to put things right for me

12:45.320 --> 12:46.960
when the time comes.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.600
Oh, I shall pay in advance.

12:48.600 --> 12:51.120
Do you think you'll still
be cleaning in five years?

12:51.120 --> 12:53.520
And she still thinks
I'm just a cleaner.

12:54.800 --> 12:57.040
Observe. Oh, you can leave that.

12:57.040 --> 12:58.840
It's an old stain.
I've tried to get it out

12:58.840 --> 13:01.000
for over a decade. Is that right?

13:01.000 --> 13:02.040
Mm.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.560
Oh...

13:14.080 --> 13:16.400
Et voila!

13:16.400 --> 13:18.880
Oh! Looks like the training
paid off, doesn't it?

13:18.880 --> 13:20.240
Oh, it's a miracle!

13:20.240 --> 13:21.520
Could I borrow that?

13:21.520 --> 13:24.520
I have a job
it could make light work of.

13:24.520 --> 13:26.240
You'll have to get me to do it.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.480
This stuff's serious.
You have to have a permit.

13:28.480 --> 13:31.320
I once saw it dissolve
an entire mouse.

13:31.320 --> 13:33.360
You are rather good at what you do.

13:33.360 --> 13:35.120
You sound surprised. I am.

13:35.120 --> 13:36.640
Oh, believe me, I am.

13:38.080 --> 13:42.080
Not on there!
It's Regency, for God's sake!

13:42.080 --> 13:45.120
This is a very confusing
relationship!

14:02.560 --> 14:03.600
Miss Hozier?

14:07.440 --> 14:08.840
Miss Hozier?

14:21.480 --> 14:23.080
Shut up!

14:29.720 --> 14:33.280
Oh, my God! Do you want
my heart to explode?

14:33.280 --> 14:34.960
Tell me this isn't yours.

14:36.680 --> 14:40.440
This house has been
in my family for generations.

14:40.440 --> 14:42.320
It's all mine.

14:42.320 --> 14:43.840
You've got an Aston Martin?

14:43.840 --> 14:45.240
Oh, that old thing.

14:45.240 --> 14:47.680
That old...? This is a Volante.

14:47.680 --> 14:49.800
It's one of the most
beautiful cars ever made.

14:50.960 --> 14:52.200
What is it, a '79?

14:52.200 --> 14:53.480
'80, I think.

14:53.480 --> 14:55.600
'80. 5.3 litre.

14:55.600 --> 14:58.080
Have you any idea
how much this car's worth?

14:59.640 --> 15:01.160
At least five vases.

15:04.520 --> 15:06.280
Do you know what?

15:06.280 --> 15:09.160
I sometimes imagine that
I'm cleaning up for the Mob,

15:09.160 --> 15:11.000
like after someone's been whacked,

15:11.000 --> 15:13.960
and this - this is my getaway car.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.680
It's about the only way
I could afford one.

15:16.680 --> 15:20.040
I thought we had established
that crime doesn't pay.

15:21.520 --> 15:22.760
Ah, that'll be Sir James.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.200
Hey, what was it
you wanted me to clean?

15:29.000 --> 15:30.600
Where is the bastard now?

15:30.600 --> 15:32.440
I'll flog him myself!

15:32.440 --> 15:35.000
He died in the struggle.
He fell down the stairs.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.280
Good! I've a mind to go to
the morgue and flog him anyway.

15:38.280 --> 15:42.160
Who would do this
to an artefact, Sir James?

15:42.160 --> 15:44.320
They don't know right from wrong!

15:44.320 --> 15:46.920
Morals of a...howler monkey!

15:46.920 --> 15:50.040
I'm amazed he didn't do toilet
on it afterwards.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.560
Now, have the police
secured the building?

15:52.560 --> 15:53.960
Oh, they've sent a man,

15:53.960 --> 15:55.800
and he has nailed down
the window for us.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.040
Yeah.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.360
Ah! Total botched job!

15:59.360 --> 16:02.880
They're not trained for anything,
that's the problem.

16:02.880 --> 16:05.800
I remember the time when
a bobby was a military man.

16:05.800 --> 16:09.960
Discipline! Nowadays,
it's children in long hats.

16:09.960 --> 16:12.640
Hiya. I know the police sergeant
in charge, actually,

16:12.640 --> 16:13.840
and she's very good.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.240
Who the hell are you?

16:15.240 --> 16:17.840
Oh, this is Wicky. He's come
to help clean up the mess.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Ah! A male cleaner!

16:21.000 --> 16:22.440
The world's gone mad.

16:23.920 --> 16:26.840
Women in pubs drinking pints.

16:26.840 --> 16:30.040
Two boys taking over
Penny's flower shop.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.160
I'm telling you,

16:31.160 --> 16:34.200
within our lifetime,
we will be swapping clothes

16:34.200 --> 16:36.480
and having sex with robots!

16:37.640 --> 16:39.200
They're looking into that, you know.

16:39.200 --> 16:42.360
Well, apparently, he's trained.

16:42.360 --> 16:43.560
He has some special fluid.

16:43.560 --> 16:46.960
You don't need chemicals
on that stair, you need tallow.

16:46.960 --> 16:49.160
What's tallow? Gah, I knew it.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.160
I have some tallow. Oh.

16:52.400 --> 16:55.080
I predicted this when I played golf
with the Chief Inspector

16:55.080 --> 16:56.120
last week.

16:57.400 --> 17:01.280
Oh, there is social housing
a moped ride from here.

17:02.320 --> 17:04.480
All on benefits. Imagine...

17:04.480 --> 17:06.960
They only go out of the house
to rob.

17:06.960 --> 17:09.240
Rest of the time,
they're on their video games.

17:09.240 --> 17:12.720
Won't be long before
they evolve giant thumbs.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.720
And what then, huh? Well,

17:14.720 --> 17:16.400
hopefully, they'll starve to death

17:16.400 --> 17:19.280
because they can no longer open
their precious bags of crisps.

17:19.280 --> 17:21.120
Tallow!

17:21.120 --> 17:22.400
Yeah, good girl.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.120
Here.

17:25.080 --> 17:26.200
Apply that.

17:26.200 --> 17:27.640
Sorry, what is this?

17:27.640 --> 17:29.680
Mutton fat!

17:29.680 --> 17:31.680
I don't think I'm going to
put that on the carpet,

17:31.680 --> 17:34.400
because I think it might be insane.

17:34.400 --> 17:35.640
There you have it.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.720
Traditional skills lost forever.

17:37.720 --> 17:40.320
Right, until this house
is properly secured,

17:40.320 --> 17:42.080
I want the whole area patrolled.

17:42.080 --> 17:44.000
I'll go and put together a roster

17:44.000 --> 17:46.120
from some of the Pony Club boys.

17:46.120 --> 17:47.160
Gay boyband?

17:49.360 --> 17:52.120
You ever been chased
by a mounted man?

17:52.120 --> 17:53.960
Not for ages.

17:53.960 --> 17:57.280
A protester I once pursued
soiled himself,

17:57.280 --> 17:58.680
front and back,

17:58.680 --> 18:01.480
after merely hearing
the thunder of hooves on turf.

18:02.600 --> 18:05.280
The environment was
the least of his concerns,

18:05.280 --> 18:07.720
I can tell you. Hmph.

18:07.720 --> 18:11.440
We will hunt them down like vermin.

18:12.480 --> 18:13.520
You're so kind.

18:16.440 --> 18:17.480
Yeah.

18:17.480 --> 18:19.800
Bring a shotgun
when I come back tomorrow.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.280
You need a weapon in this house.

18:23.280 --> 18:24.320
A weapon!

18:40.800 --> 18:43.120
Sir James is very well connected.

18:43.120 --> 18:44.600
He seems lovely. Mm.

18:46.040 --> 18:48.480
I still can't believe the blood
came this far, you know.

18:48.480 --> 18:51.080
Doesn't make sense
from a neck break.

18:52.120 --> 18:53.360
Where were you standing?

18:53.360 --> 18:55.720
Oh... In the middle of the stairs.

18:55.720 --> 18:57.720
So why weren't you covered in it?

18:57.720 --> 19:00.600
I... It must have missed me.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.800
No, no, the spatter pattern means...

19:02.800 --> 19:04.560
It means that you would have been...

19:05.800 --> 19:07.080
Well, I must get on.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.240
Hang on.

19:10.640 --> 19:13.120
What was it you wanted me to clean?

19:13.120 --> 19:14.640
What?

19:14.640 --> 19:17.120
In the other room.
What was it you wanted me to clean?

19:17.120 --> 19:18.360
Oh...

19:18.360 --> 19:20.000
..it wasn't important.

19:21.040 --> 19:22.920
A brass pig.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.360
A brass pig?

19:25.360 --> 19:27.520
A brass pig, my arse.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.160
Where are you going?

19:40.720 --> 19:43.120
You've done a pretty good job
of getting it clean.

19:43.120 --> 19:45.520
But to make blood undetectable,

19:45.520 --> 19:48.160
you need a specialist fluid.

19:50.320 --> 19:51.680
I'll make a pot of tea.

19:58.640 --> 20:00.720
So he didn't die in the fall?

20:00.720 --> 20:03.440
Well, I thought he had at first.

20:03.440 --> 20:05.400
He really did land badly.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.520
The sound was like a...

20:07.520 --> 20:09.960
Yeah, yeah, mighty oak,
Crunchie. So?

20:09.960 --> 20:13.360
Well, I picked up one of the clubs
he pulled down in the fall.

20:13.360 --> 20:17.160
I wanted to be armed
in case he came for me.

20:17.160 --> 20:18.840
For when his broken neck had healed?

20:18.840 --> 20:20.680
I was going to call the police,

20:20.680 --> 20:22.920
I really was, but then I...

20:22.920 --> 20:24.080
..then I saw it again.

20:25.280 --> 20:26.680
How could he?!

20:26.680 --> 20:30.560
All of this heritage destroyed,
and for what?

20:30.560 --> 20:31.600
What?

20:32.800 --> 20:34.560
Not the damn chair again?!

20:34.560 --> 20:36.480
Barely remember picking up the club.

20:36.480 --> 20:39.280
It was a beautiful swing,
under the circumstances.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.480
I've been taking lessons.

20:40.480 --> 20:43.040
One clean stroke...

20:44.440 --> 20:45.840
..and it was done.

20:45.840 --> 20:48.200
You killed him? Well, anyone
would have done the same.

20:48.200 --> 20:49.520
I wouldn't!

20:51.040 --> 20:53.280
Well, what's done is done.

20:54.840 --> 20:56.680
I must get on.

20:56.680 --> 20:59.280
Wait! I can't let this go.

20:59.280 --> 21:01.560
I have to report it.
You murdered him!

21:01.560 --> 21:05.200
And who will believe the cleaner?

21:05.200 --> 21:07.240
I knew you didn't respect
the training.

21:07.240 --> 21:09.880
Oh, I have plenty of people
to vouch for my character.

21:09.880 --> 21:13.760
It's not inconceivable that
you dreamt the whole thing up.

21:13.760 --> 21:15.880
An admired member of the community

21:15.880 --> 21:18.760
blackmailed by an unskilled labourer.

21:18.760 --> 21:19.920
Unskilled?

21:19.920 --> 21:21.600
I cleaned your lamp!

21:21.600 --> 21:23.200
He was a common criminal.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.400
Who will miss him?

21:24.400 --> 21:26.520
How do you know
what was going on in his life?

21:26.520 --> 21:30.240
He might have a sick child.
Oh, put your violin away!

21:30.240 --> 21:32.520
An eye for an eye -
it's in the Bible.

21:32.520 --> 21:34.280
Oh, yeah. Thou shalt not steal,

21:34.280 --> 21:37.480
or you'll get smacked round the back
of the head with a golf club.

21:39.600 --> 21:40.800
How much do you want?

21:40.800 --> 21:43.240
You're not listening.

21:43.240 --> 21:46.160
You could get an education,
you could get a better job,

21:46.160 --> 21:48.160
really make something of your life.

21:48.160 --> 21:51.040
My job means that
I can buy everything I need

21:51.040 --> 21:52.680
and still have enough money

21:52.680 --> 21:55.000
to give myself a hangover
every weekend.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.360
You cannot buy your way out of this.

22:02.040 --> 22:04.240
Well...

22:04.240 --> 22:08.880
..I really don't have
much use for that car.

22:10.280 --> 22:12.200
What, the Aston? Yes.

22:12.200 --> 22:15.280
I only use it for popping down
to the shops.

22:15.280 --> 22:17.680
I mean, that's the worst thing
you've said today.

22:17.680 --> 22:19.080
It's an Aston Martin.

22:19.080 --> 22:20.440
Exactly.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.080
Such a waste.

22:22.080 --> 22:23.560
Ah...

22:23.560 --> 22:25.000
I see.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.440
Well, you can forget it.

22:26.440 --> 22:28.760
I couldn't even afford
to insure the damn thing.

22:28.760 --> 22:30.880
Oh, I shall insure it for you.

22:30.880 --> 22:33.640
Let's call it my advance payment

22:33.640 --> 22:36.960
for you making things right for me.
Hm?

22:40.040 --> 22:42.600
Now, I must get on.

22:42.600 --> 22:44.040
I have church later.

22:44.040 --> 22:45.520
Miss Hozier...

22:49.760 --> 22:51.360
Please, Wicky.

22:53.240 --> 22:54.280
Please?

23:06.400 --> 23:08.120
God, it's beautiful.

23:18.760 --> 23:20.880
Weasel, what do you want? It was me.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.560
What? I sicked in your shoes.

23:22.560 --> 23:23.960
I knew it was you.

23:23.960 --> 23:25.320
Oh, right.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.840
It's just, Jen said you might
have thought it was Fat Carl

23:27.840 --> 23:29.200
and, at first, I was happy,

23:29.200 --> 23:31.080
because you'd be cross with him
instead of me,

23:31.080 --> 23:34.560
but then I thought,
if you end up punching him,
I'll feel bad. It's OK.

23:34.560 --> 23:36.360
I'll clean them
if you leave them in the pub.

23:36.360 --> 23:39.640
No, listen, Weasel.
I appreciate you calling.

23:39.640 --> 23:41.760
It's good that you did
the right thing.

23:41.760 --> 23:43.600
Hang on, it wasn't my fault.
I'd had a bad...

23:49.480 --> 23:50.520
Dammit.

23:58.600 --> 24:00.640
Jesus! What the hell?

24:00.640 --> 24:02.600
Ah, what did I tell you?

24:02.600 --> 24:04.680
24 hours they've had,

24:04.680 --> 24:08.520
and I was able to break back in
from the side window!

24:08.520 --> 24:09.840
Is that a crowbar?

24:09.840 --> 24:13.160
Yes, an everyday crowbar,
and I'm back in!

24:13.160 --> 24:16.240
You people are in league
with the underworld!

24:16.240 --> 24:18.400
I'll have all your jobs.

24:18.400 --> 24:20.600
Right. Well, you're the one
who's broken the law.

24:20.600 --> 24:23.760
Oh, well, we'll see what
the Chief Inspector says about that.

24:23.760 --> 24:25.440
It's called civic duty.

24:25.440 --> 24:28.040
For God's sake! Get out!

24:28.040 --> 24:29.840
I can't. What?

24:29.840 --> 24:31.320
I have my trouser caught.

24:35.880 --> 24:39.360
They're genetically modifying
beef to grow like lettuce,

24:39.360 --> 24:41.120
you know.

24:41.120 --> 24:42.720
No more farms...

24:43.800 --> 24:47.560
..just limbless cows on shelves.

24:47.560 --> 24:49.560
Be quiet.

24:52.720 --> 24:54.040
Right.

24:55.480 --> 24:57.440
And they're putting chemicals
in the water.

24:59.160 --> 25:02.120
I've seen crows
the size of Labradors.

25:04.840 --> 25:06.960
Go home, you silly man.

25:06.960 --> 25:08.000
Yeah...

25:09.800 --> 25:14.800
She's a fine woman, you know,
Vivien Hozier. Good stock.

25:16.040 --> 25:18.480
She deserves something
more than this.

25:40.680 --> 25:44.000
Get...off...my...sofa!

25:44.000 --> 25:45.840
Wait... Wait!

25:48.960 --> 25:51.440
Oh, no, no!

25:52.920 --> 25:56.080
It's ruined. Look what
you've made me do!

25:56.080 --> 25:57.400
It's ruined!

25:57.400 --> 25:58.440
Miss Hozier...

25:58.440 --> 26:00.000
Why don't you understand?

26:00.000 --> 26:02.240
It's my history, it's my family!

26:02.240 --> 26:06.720
It isn't. They don't care
about the chair. They've gone!

26:08.600 --> 26:10.600
He didn't deserve what you did,
Vivien.

26:13.200 --> 26:14.960
Well...

26:14.960 --> 26:16.680
..I imagine you...

26:17.720 --> 26:19.480
..you have to make a phone call.

26:19.480 --> 26:21.440
Yes. I'm sorry.

26:38.440 --> 26:40.280
What are you doing with that?

26:40.280 --> 26:43.120
I'm putting it back
where it belongs.

26:43.120 --> 26:46.200
My barrister is a great admirer
of my artefacts,

26:46.200 --> 26:48.840
and I'd hate him
to see things out of place.

26:48.840 --> 26:49.960
Your barrister?

26:49.960 --> 26:52.040
Yes, he's on his way.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.760
He doesn't think
I'll have a problem.

26:53.760 --> 26:56.040
The circumstances, my reputation...

26:56.040 --> 26:57.600
He doubts it'll even come to court.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.320
You have your way of cleaning up...

27:05.040 --> 27:06.280
..and I have mine.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.000
Right.

27:15.240 --> 27:17.240
No!

27:33.800 --> 27:35.560
It was just a sofa.

27:54.640 --> 27:56.200
Well, well, well, Mr Mop.

27:56.200 --> 27:57.960
A call on my private phone.

27:57.960 --> 27:59.520
This is an unexpected treat.

28:01.160 --> 28:02.200
What?

28:03.640 --> 28:04.680
What's up?

28:06.880 --> 28:09.600
No. No, fine. We'll come now.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.560
OK. Yeah, thanks.

28:17.960 --> 28:19.320
Dammit!
