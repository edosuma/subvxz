00:02.001 --> 00:04.086
Previously on Lost:

00:06.131 --> 00:09.634
Right now, this is our priority.

00:15.599 --> 00:17.892
How did you come to be
on this island?

00:17.976 --> 00:21.312
The ship slammed into rocks,
ran aground.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.166
Hold on a second, dude.
You want what now?

00:45.546 --> 00:48.297
- You wanna make snowballs?
- Hold the bamboo tighter.

00:50.551 --> 00:51.634
I think.

00:52.136 --> 00:53.511
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.847
- How's it coming?
- It's coming.

00:55.931 --> 00:58.558
Long as nobody sabotages
this one as well.

00:58.642 --> 01:00.768
I got people standing guard 24/7.

01:00.853 --> 01:03.980
Nobody gets near this,
with or without intent to burn.

01:04.063 --> 01:06.649
I was thinking,
the chances of a passing ship

01:06.734 --> 01:09.068
spotting this raft out there
is pretty slim.

01:09.153 --> 01:11.571
We could use something
to send a distress call

01:11.655 --> 01:14.198
to any ship that might be close.
Like an SOS.

01:14.283 --> 01:17.910
I'll ask Sayid, but even if he could
make something like that,

01:17.995 --> 01:20.288
he's not gonna have anything
to power it with.

01:20.372 --> 01:23.249
Didn't Sayid say that crazy
French chick had batteries?

01:25.586 --> 01:28.379
- Absolutely not.
- I'm not asking you to go.

01:28.464 --> 01:29.964
- I'll do it.
- No, you won't.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.175
- We're trying...
- Do you think she would

01:32.259 --> 01:34.469
give up something she needs
to a stranger?

01:34.553 --> 01:38.139
All I'm asking is for you
to tell me how to find her. That's it.

01:38.223 --> 01:40.600
I was brought unconscious to her camp.

01:40.684 --> 01:43.603
I was disoriented.
I don't know how to find her.

01:43.687 --> 01:45.688
Don't know, dude?
Or don't want to?

01:46.690 --> 01:49.442
Sayid, look. You've got
her maps and her papers.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.944
You thought they were
pointing to something.

01:52.029 --> 01:54.572
- I was wrong.
- Maybe they're pointing to her.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.699
I don't know what these papers mean!

01:56.784 --> 01:59.452
They could be the ravings
of her disturbed mind.

01:59.536 --> 02:01.829
Song lyrics, mixed with equations!

02:07.044 --> 02:08.919
If this map is pointing to her,

02:09.003 --> 02:11.964
then you should know
she resides here in this area.

02:12.049 --> 02:15.301
She gave it a name.
Territoire FoncÃ©.

02:15.385 --> 02:16.719
Shannon translated it.

02:16.804 --> 02:21.599
It means "Dark Territory." That sound
like a place you'd like to visit?

02:21.683 --> 02:24.811
- So you won't help?
- I didn't say that.

02:24.895 --> 02:28.856
I'll build the distress beacon.
I suggest you find another power source.

02:28.941 --> 02:32.610
- Something in the cockpit.
- We're not going to the cockpit.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.408
Swing your partner, dosey do

02:39.493 --> 02:42.245
- Step high!
- Hugo, what are you doing in there?

02:42.329 --> 02:45.957
- ...when you cut the...
- I'm just checking something out.

02:46.041 --> 02:49.502
I hope you're not watching those
G-string mujeres again.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.212
Look, Ma, we talked about this.

02:51.296 --> 02:54.549
If you want me living here,
you gotta respect my privacy.

02:55.259 --> 02:56.717
And no, I'm not.

02:59.096 --> 03:02.640
Look at you.
It's Saturday night.

03:02.724 --> 03:06.686
A grown-up man
sitting at home watching TV.

03:06.770 --> 03:10.106
You should go out.
Try to find yourself a nice woman.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.524
I'll get right on that.

03:11.608 --> 03:14.402
Try eating better.
You're gaining weight again.

03:14.486 --> 03:17.196
...with the Mega Number 42.

03:20.242 --> 03:23.744
And that makes tonight's
Mega Lotto Jackpot Drawing

03:23.829 --> 03:29.083
four, eight, 15, 16 and 23,

03:29.167 --> 03:31.335
with the Mega Number 42.

03:31.420 --> 03:34.130
Whoever has those numbers has won

03:34.214 --> 03:37.008
or will share
in a near record jackpot.

03:37.092 --> 03:41.304
That's right, Mary Jo, because this
is the sixteenth week without a winner.

04:13.045 --> 04:14.086
Hi.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.548
You awake?

04:18.634 --> 04:20.927
I was just wondering that myself.

04:23.639 --> 04:25.681
That French lady wrote this stuff?

04:26.350 --> 04:29.060
It's the middle of the night.
What do you want?

04:29.144 --> 04:32.104
Nothing. Couldn't sleep.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.941
And I got curious.

04:35.025 --> 04:36.734
You and Shannon,

04:36.818 --> 04:39.946
you guys have been trying
to figure out some of this stuff,

04:40.030 --> 04:42.990
and I was wondering what...

04:43.075 --> 04:46.494
...you guys figured out
about this stuff?

04:47.788 --> 04:50.247
- What stuff?
- I don't know.

04:50.332 --> 04:53.334
Well, take these numbers
she wrote down a bunch of times.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.837
Got any idea what it means?

04:59.758 --> 05:02.969
I thought at one time they might be
coordinates of some kind.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.137
Coordinates, yeah.

05:06.556 --> 05:09.767
But when you first found her,
the French chick,

05:09.851 --> 05:12.770
you said you saw a wire
or something on the beach.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.814
You followed it,
and it led you to her.

05:14.898 --> 05:18.109
No. It led me into a trap she set.

05:18.193 --> 05:20.194
But her place is probably close, right?

05:21.822 --> 05:25.074
- Why are you interested in Rousseau?
- I'm not.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.493
Just making conversation, dude.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.745
Sorry if it's a bad time.

05:31.081 --> 05:32.415
Good night.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.177
Yeah, you.

05:45.262 --> 05:48.264
How did you come up
with the winning numbers?

05:49.891 --> 05:53.394
They just sorta came to me.

05:53.478 --> 05:57.523
- Why don't you introduce your family?
- Oh, yeah, okay.

05:57.607 --> 06:01.402
This bashful beauty is my mom, Carmen.
Come here, Ma.

06:02.070 --> 06:05.406
And this is my brother, Diego,
and his wife, Lisa.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.575
- We're rich!
- Nice, dude.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.744
Ignore him. He's an idiot. And...

06:10.871 --> 06:14.081
You gotta meet this guy.
This is the greatest guy I know.

06:14.166 --> 06:18.878
My grandpa, Tito.
He's worked three jobs for...

06:18.962 --> 06:21.213
- How long's it been, Abuelito?
- 52 years.

06:21.298 --> 06:22.548
Fifty-two years!

06:22.632 --> 06:26.135
He's 70 years old, and the closest thing
that he's had to a vacation

06:26.219 --> 06:29.221
is when they put a pacemaker
in him four years ago.

06:29.306 --> 06:33.684
The first thing I'll do with the money
is to give him the rest he's earned.

06:33.769 --> 06:35.603
That's what it's all about for me,

06:35.687 --> 06:39.482
to be able to do things
for the people I care about.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.526
'Cause I really put my family
through a lot recently,

06:42.611 --> 06:45.696
and, well, this way
I can make it up to them.

06:45.781 --> 06:50.409
You know, maybe even
buy my mom a new house.

06:50.494 --> 06:53.746
And maybe after my grandpa
comes back from his cruise,

06:53.830 --> 06:58.501
we can get to do some of the things
that we always wanted to do.

07:01.296 --> 07:02.797
Grandpa?

07:08.428 --> 07:10.096
- Hey.
- I'm not doing anything.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.597
What?

07:13.183 --> 07:15.101
- What?
- Just saying good morning.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.686
Oh. Right.

07:17.771 --> 07:18.896
Morning.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.774
- Sorry.
- You going somewhere?

07:21.858 --> 07:23.150
Me? No.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.363
Well, yeah...

07:28.782 --> 07:30.699
...just thought I might take a walk.

07:31.701 --> 07:34.787
Maybe scope out some new fishing area.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.497
- I'll come with.
- That's okay.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.290
I could use a bit of the wide open.

07:38.375 --> 07:41.710
Dude, I could really use
some alone time right now.

07:42.796 --> 07:43.921
Sure.

07:53.390 --> 07:56.016
I'm a big guy.
I get dehydrated easy.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.269
Yeah.

07:59.688 --> 08:00.771
Yeah, okay.

08:08.613 --> 08:12.158
Claire, you got a second?

08:12.909 --> 08:14.952
- Sure.
- I was wondering if you're free

08:15.036 --> 08:16.787
to help me with a little project.

08:16.872 --> 08:18.497
- Me?
- Yeah.

08:18.582 --> 08:22.001
I'm building something and I could
use an extra pair of hands.

08:22.085 --> 08:25.254
I'm nine months pregnant.
I can barely waddle to the beach.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.589
Could you hold a saw?

08:29.885 --> 08:32.303
- Yeah.
- Can you move your hand back and forth?

08:34.431 --> 08:36.515
- Possibly.
- You're perfect.

08:37.267 --> 08:38.475
Come on.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.438
Okay.

08:48.111 --> 08:51.488
So, what exactly are we building?

08:54.618 --> 08:55.701
Where is it?

08:58.747 --> 09:01.749
- Where's what?
- The map. It won't help you find her.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.542
- I don't have it.
- What's worse

09:03.627 --> 09:06.545
is you won't do your own dirty work.
You get Hurley to do it.

09:06.630 --> 09:08.547
Wait a minute. Hurley?

09:08.632 --> 09:11.550
He was in my tent last night.
Quizzing me about Rousseau.

09:11.635 --> 09:14.720
About numbers she wrote,
how I came to find her.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.184
You don't know anything
about this, do you?

09:21.978 --> 09:24.480
Charlie, have you seen Hurley?

09:25.440 --> 09:28.150
Couple of hours ago.
He was setting out for a walk.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.902
Acting like a loon, I might add.

09:31.655 --> 09:33.572
My God. He's going after her.

09:34.908 --> 09:39.119
- When are you gonna be back?
- If we catch him, before nightfall.

09:39.204 --> 09:40.496
Why?

09:40.997 --> 09:42.331
Are you worried about me?

09:43.875 --> 09:44.959
So what if I am?

09:47.671 --> 09:49.255
Sayid!

09:49.339 --> 09:50.589
You ready?

09:56.304 --> 09:58.389
I'll be fine.

10:18.243 --> 10:20.286
Hugo, turn that noise down.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.663
Oh, sorry.

10:25.667 --> 10:28.794
Where are you taking me?
You know I don't like surprises.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.963
You're gonna like this one, Ma.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.716
I mean, after everything
you've been through...

10:33.800 --> 10:35.259
...like Grandpa...

10:38.888 --> 10:42.725
Then at the funeral, Father Aguilar
getting struck by lightning.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.519
Man, that was a freak storm.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.938
And Diego moving back home

10:48.023 --> 10:52.651
- after Lisa left him for that waitress.
- Don't mention that whore.

10:52.736 --> 10:55.571
I'm just saying, you deserve
something good to happen.

11:00.785 --> 11:03.078
You know,

11:03.163 --> 11:05.581
ever since I won the lottery,
it's like...

11:07.125 --> 11:09.668
...we've had nothing but bad luck.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.421
Like, I don't know,

11:12.505 --> 11:14.298
the money's cursed or something.

11:15.592 --> 11:18.344
That's blasphemy.
You know we are Catholic.

11:18.428 --> 11:21.972
- We don't believe in curses.
- Ma, I'm just talking.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.977
Okay, we're almost there.
Here, put this on.

11:43.036 --> 11:46.038
- Why do I have to wear this?
- Give me your hand. Careful.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.915
- You be careful.
- Stepping down.

11:47.999 --> 11:49.958
I can't see anything.

11:51.294 --> 11:54.505
Okay, now,
take off your blindfold,

11:54.589 --> 11:57.633
and get a look at
your new dream house.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.510
My ankle.

11:59.969 --> 12:02.137
I said take off your blindfold.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.681
Why did you make me
put that thing on?

12:08.269 --> 12:09.812
Do I smell smoke?

12:11.231 --> 12:12.898
Crap!

12:12.982 --> 12:14.441
Hang on. I gotta call 911.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.985
You tell them I broke my ankle.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.455
Drop the phone.
Move away from the vehicle.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.582
- It's the house.
- Do it! Now!

12:30.667 --> 12:32.042
Turn around.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.132
No such thing as curses, Ma?

12:39.134 --> 12:41.009
You have the right to remain silent.

12:41.094 --> 12:44.430
Anything you say can and will
be used against you.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.699
French chick!

13:12.041 --> 13:13.750
I would think you'd be happy.

13:13.835 --> 13:15.461
Every one of your stocks is up.

13:15.545 --> 13:18.464
Your interests in orange futures
skyrocketed

13:18.548 --> 13:20.966
after those tropical storms hit Florida.

13:21.050 --> 13:24.470
And you are now
the majority shareholder

13:24.554 --> 13:28.056
for a box company in Tustin.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.726
- A box company?
- They make boxes.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.896
Lucrative business.
Everybody needs boxes.

13:33.980 --> 13:37.316
Which reminds me,
your sneaker factory in Canada...

13:37.400 --> 13:40.819
- I own a sneaker factory in Canada?
- Well, not anymore.

13:40.904 --> 13:45.407
- It was destroyed in a fire last month.
- Of course it was.

13:45.492 --> 13:48.869
You might have read about it.
Eight-something people died.

13:48.953 --> 13:51.497
But the good news is,
we over-insured it.

13:51.581 --> 13:53.457
It's gonna yield you a windfall.

13:53.541 --> 13:57.211
And when we add in the generous
settlement from the LAPD

13:57.295 --> 14:00.672
for your false arrest,
you've almost doubled your net worth

14:00.757 --> 14:01.882
in a few short months.

14:01.966 --> 14:05.552
I still can't imagine how the police
mistook you for a drug dealer.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.096
Bad luck.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.891
You are not the first
lottery winner to believe

14:10.975 --> 14:14.144
the money's brought nothing but trouble.
It's in your head.

14:14.229 --> 14:16.730
You don't believe in jinxes?
You know, curses?

14:16.814 --> 14:18.982
I'm an accountant.
I believe in numbers.

14:19.067 --> 14:21.527
- Where'd you get 'em, anyway?
- What?

14:21.611 --> 14:24.363
The numbers. What did you use?
Somebody's birthday?

14:24.447 --> 14:28.450
- Phone number?
- It's nothing. It's just something...

14:31.704 --> 14:32.996
What?

14:35.333 --> 14:37.209
That's it.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.586
It's not the money,
it's the numbers.

14:39.671 --> 14:40.963
The numbers are cursed.

14:42.257 --> 14:44.383
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not crazy.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.802
- This is really...
- Listen to yourself.

14:46.970 --> 14:50.681
"The numbers are cursed."
You know there is no such thing as...

15:04.988 --> 15:06.822
You wanna hit that a little harder?

15:08.449 --> 15:12.244
I'm sorry. Is my building a raft
to get us rescued bothering you?

15:12.328 --> 15:15.247
- At the moment, yeah.
- Why aren't you helping?

15:15.331 --> 15:17.416
I am helping, short-round.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.167
Keeping watch for arsonists.

15:19.961 --> 15:21.962
Walt's got a point.

15:22.046 --> 15:25.507
You could pitch in,
as you've already bought your ticket.

15:30.221 --> 15:33.515
Did you tie this like I told you?
If you'd tied it like I told you,

15:33.600 --> 15:35.767
the thing would still be together.

15:35.852 --> 15:39.521
What's the matter with you?
What is your problem?

15:42.859 --> 15:45.027
He's never going
to speak to me again.

15:46.779 --> 15:47.946
He just needs time.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.951
I humiliated him.

15:59.125 --> 16:02.544
When the raft sails,

16:02.629 --> 16:05.213
do you think he's going
to leave with them?

16:07.216 --> 16:08.717
I don't know.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.634
Don't move!

16:51.844 --> 16:54.346
- Hey, what are you guys...?
- Do not move.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.306
You're on a pressure trigger.

16:56.391 --> 16:59.518
If you take your weight off it,
it will release that.

17:04.272 --> 17:05.523
Oh, man.

17:07.609 --> 17:10.278
We need to replace
his weight on the trigger.

17:10.363 --> 17:13.156
- How we gonna do that?
- Don't move.

17:13.241 --> 17:15.200
Hey, everybody just calm down.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.661
- Can I drop the wire?
- Maybe I'll find a rock.

17:17.744 --> 17:19.579
- I'm dropping the wire.
- No!

17:23.835 --> 17:25.585
- I can make it.
- Don't move.

17:25.670 --> 17:27.671
I can get out of the way.
I'm spry.

17:27.755 --> 17:29.631
- Stay put.
- No, wait!

17:30.049 --> 17:31.174
Don't even...

17:37.098 --> 17:39.725
Hurley, what the bloody hell's
wrong with you?

17:39.809 --> 17:41.935
Nothing.

17:44.355 --> 17:45.856
What are you doing out here?

17:46.566 --> 17:47.941
I came to get a battery.

17:49.026 --> 17:51.820
Seriously, what's going on?

17:51.904 --> 17:53.447
Nada.

17:54.115 --> 17:55.574
You guys coming?

17:59.996 --> 18:02.914
You all want to go? Fine.

18:03.499 --> 18:06.168
But perhaps I should take the lead.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.336
Excellent notion.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.720
Lenny. His name is Lenny.

18:16.804 --> 18:19.681
- Or Leonard.
- But you don't know his last name.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.392
Look, I just need to talk to him
for five minutes.

18:22.477 --> 18:24.478
If you can't tell me
the person's name,

18:24.562 --> 18:27.647
- I can't look it up.
- How many Leonards are here?

18:27.732 --> 18:29.608
Can't you just type in "Leonard"?

18:29.692 --> 18:32.569
The guy's been here forever.
He knows me.

18:32.653 --> 18:35.280
Our records are private,
And any visitors...

18:35.364 --> 18:37.866
Dude, do not
do that right now!

18:37.950 --> 18:41.161
Leave the bulb for another time, man.

18:46.709 --> 18:48.126
Five minutes.

18:48.211 --> 18:50.921
All I need is five minutes.

18:52.882 --> 18:55.634
- Oh, hey, doc.
- It's good to see you!

18:55.718 --> 18:57.260
What are you doing back here?

19:01.974 --> 19:05.185
I don't remember you and Leonard
being that close, Hugo.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.313
Yeah. Well, we hung.

19:09.065 --> 19:11.316
I'll leave you gentlemen to it.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.443
Good luck, Hugo.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.284
Hey, Lenny.

19:22.286 --> 19:23.745
Remember me?

19:26.249 --> 19:27.791
Hugo.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.169
Hurley.

19:33.422 --> 19:35.465
Well, I was...

19:35.550 --> 19:38.677
...just, you know,
in the neighborhood and...

19:44.100 --> 19:47.978
Look, Lenny, I gotta know,
what do the numbers mean?

19:48.062 --> 19:51.189
4-8-15
16-23-42.

19:58.114 --> 20:00.448
Come on, Lenny,
give me something.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.285
Anything.
Where'd you get the numbers?

20:05.913 --> 20:08.540
Is that why you're here?

20:08.624 --> 20:10.208
It's 'cause of the numbers?

20:10.293 --> 20:12.168
Did they do something to you?

20:12.962 --> 20:15.505
'Cause I think
they did something to me.

20:16.465 --> 20:19.467
I think they turned me into a jinx.

20:20.595 --> 20:22.846
Bad news to everyone around me.

20:22.930 --> 20:25.223
And when I tell people
I think I'm the cause,

20:26.809 --> 20:29.394
they look at me like I'm nuts.

20:29.478 --> 20:32.230
They don't believe me.
But, I know.

20:32.315 --> 20:35.025
Ever since I won the lottery
with those numbers...

20:40.907 --> 20:44.534
You used those numbers
to play the lottery?

20:49.206 --> 20:51.625
- Yeah.
- You shouldn't have done that.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.587
- You've opened the box.
- I what?

20:55.671 --> 20:57.714
- You shouldn't have used those!
- Why?

20:57.798 --> 21:00.717
It doesn't stop!
You gotta get away from those numbers.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.595
- You gotta get far away.
- All right. Slow down.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.096
Don't you understand?

21:05.181 --> 21:07.599
You gotta get away from them
or it won't stop.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.684
- Calm down.
- Wait. I need answers.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.519
- Step away.
- The numbers!

21:11.604 --> 21:14.189
- Where'd you get 'em?
- Sam Toomey. He heard them.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.232
He heard them in Kalgoorlie.

21:16.317 --> 21:18.526
- What's Kalgoorlie?
- It's a town.

21:18.611 --> 21:22.280
- A town where?
- In Australia.

21:22.365 --> 21:24.199
Oh, God.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.411
It stops here.

21:28.496 --> 21:30.413
It goes into the ground.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.125
This poses somewhat of a problem.

21:34.210 --> 21:37.504
Guys, you should come see this.

21:57.441 --> 22:01.444
- You never mentioned a bridge.
- I never saw this before.

22:02.238 --> 22:06.032
- No way she could have built this.
- No, but her team could have.

22:06.117 --> 22:07.909
Or Ethan's team.

22:10.496 --> 22:13.498
- What are you doing?
- Relax, I'm just gonna check it out.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.667
- You guys stay here.
- Get back here!

22:15.751 --> 22:17.961
Dudes, chill.

23:01.505 --> 23:02.589
If he can do it...

23:44.340 --> 23:45.507
Dude, you okay?

23:47.968 --> 23:49.969
I'm okay.

23:50.971 --> 23:52.347
You two stay right there.

23:52.431 --> 23:55.016
We'll find a way around,
and we'll meet you there.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.310
Screw that!
You guys stay!

23:57.394 --> 23:59.020
There's a path right here.

23:59.105 --> 24:02.148
Will you shut up and listen to Jack.
He said stay put.

24:02.233 --> 24:04.400
You're acting like a bloody lunatic.

24:19.458 --> 24:22.752
If this weren't the middle of nowhere,
I'd say you were lost.

24:22.837 --> 24:26.214
- Hi. Is this Sam Toomey's house?
- It is. I'm his wife.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.049
Well, is he around?

24:28.134 --> 24:30.802
'Cause I'd kinda like to talk to him.

24:30.886 --> 24:32.637
I'd like that too,

24:32.721 --> 24:35.431
but Sam's been dead for four years.

24:38.060 --> 24:41.646
Your husband worked
with a guy I know, Leonard Simms.

24:41.730 --> 24:45.150
That's right.
They served together in the U.S. Navy.

24:45.234 --> 24:46.943
How is Leonard?

24:47.027 --> 24:48.736
Still in the service?

24:49.363 --> 24:53.324
He's... retired.

24:55.077 --> 24:58.830
Anyway, he told me about Sam...

24:58.914 --> 25:00.373
...hearing something.

25:03.377 --> 25:05.837
- You're talking about the numbers.
- Yes.

25:05.921 --> 25:07.797
The numbers. Exactly.

25:07.882 --> 25:10.258
Do you know anything about them?

25:11.677 --> 25:15.263
Sam and Leonard were stationed
at a listening post

25:15.347 --> 25:18.850
monitoring long-wave transmissions
out of the Pacific.

25:18.934 --> 25:21.394
Boring job. Sam hated it.

25:22.271 --> 25:25.440
Nothing to do but listen to static,
night after night.

25:25.524 --> 25:30.278
Until one night,
about 16 years ago,

25:30.362 --> 25:32.155
there's something in the static.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.657
A voice comes through,

25:34.742 --> 25:38.203
a voice repeating those numbers

25:38.287 --> 25:39.746
over and over again.

25:43.626 --> 25:47.503
Couple of days later,
we're at the fair in Kalgoorlie,

25:47.588 --> 25:51.591
and some wally there's got this jar,
must have been big as a pony.

25:51.675 --> 25:55.553
It's filled to the rim with beans.
Fella's offering 50 grand to anyone

25:55.638 --> 25:59.933
able to guess how many beans
were in that jar within ten.

26:00.851 --> 26:03.061
- Sam used the numbers.
- Yep.

26:03.145 --> 26:06.522
The answer was exact to the bean.

26:07.316 --> 26:10.818
Man had been running
the same scam for 40 years,

26:10.903 --> 26:13.071
nobody had ever come close.

26:14.198 --> 26:16.074
So we won the money.

26:16.158 --> 26:20.912
On the way home, a pickup truck
blows a tire on the highway,

26:20.996 --> 26:22.830
hits us head-on.

26:23.749 --> 26:26.084
Lost my leg that night.

26:28.003 --> 26:30.797
- What about Sam?
- Barely a scratch.

26:31.423 --> 26:34.759
Most people would consider
themselves lucky,

26:34.843 --> 26:36.886
but not him.

26:37.972 --> 26:40.139
He was never the same after that.

26:41.141 --> 26:43.518
He started keeping a record.

26:45.062 --> 26:48.773
Anything terrible that happened
to anyone around us,

26:48.857 --> 26:51.943
he believed it was all
because he used those numbers.

26:52.027 --> 26:55.905
He moved us out here in the middle
of nowhere, hoping it would stop.

26:55.990 --> 26:57.031
Did it?

26:58.701 --> 27:00.618
Did he ever find a way
to make it stop?

27:02.121 --> 27:03.288
Yep.

27:05.457 --> 27:08.209
He put a shotgun in his mouth
and pulled the trigger.

27:11.297 --> 27:14.173
What is it you're looking for,
Mr. Reyes?

27:19.888 --> 27:21.389
I used them.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.767
The numbers.

27:25.436 --> 27:27.395
To win the lottery.

27:30.065 --> 27:33.818
And now I think
I'm under the same curse.

27:33.902 --> 27:37.322
Curse? There's no curse.

27:37.406 --> 27:40.116
- You just told me...
- You think I'd still have my leg

27:40.200 --> 27:42.869
if Sam hadn't have picked
the right number of beans?

27:42.953 --> 27:44.620
Floods wouldn't have happened?

27:44.705 --> 27:47.707
Homes wouldn't have burned?
People wouldn't have died?

27:50.919 --> 27:53.046
Well... yeah.

27:53.756 --> 27:57.467
You make your own luck, Mr. Reyes.

27:57.551 --> 28:00.845
Don't blame it on the damn numbers.

28:00.929 --> 28:05.141
You're looking for an excuse
that doesn't exist.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.230
It's a trap, right?

28:11.315 --> 28:13.900
For catching animals?

28:14.693 --> 28:16.069
Pass me that cup, please.

28:19.323 --> 28:21.824
- What's this gunk?
- Glue.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.535
Where'd you find glue?

28:24.620 --> 28:28.081
I made it out of
rendered animal fat.

28:28.791 --> 28:30.500
You made glue?

28:32.795 --> 28:34.504
Wow.

28:34.588 --> 28:39.425
You should have one of those shows
where you fix up houses for people.

28:41.053 --> 28:42.220
I don't think so.

28:47.643 --> 28:50.478
Thanks for this.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.855
Giving me something to do.

28:55.317 --> 28:59.654
I'm tired of trying to remember
what happened to me out there.

29:01.782 --> 29:03.157
How's that coming...

29:05.744 --> 29:07.328
...your memory?

29:07.413 --> 29:09.956
Bits and pieces.
Here and there.

29:10.916 --> 29:13.376
Nothing that makes any real sense.

29:14.878 --> 29:16.629
Well, maybe I can help.

29:18.340 --> 29:22.468
I'm good at putting
bits and pieces together.

29:45.659 --> 29:47.118
What?

29:47.202 --> 29:49.412
This is familiar. This area.

29:50.747 --> 29:52.290
We're close.

29:53.417 --> 29:55.042
How do you know?

29:55.711 --> 29:57.670
I thought she lived underground.

30:03.177 --> 30:04.844
What the hell was that?

30:17.566 --> 30:19.484
Hell of a security system.

30:19.568 --> 30:22.487
Somebody trips a wire,
and the whole place blows up.

30:22.571 --> 30:25.072
- There's nothing here.
- The batteries?

30:25.157 --> 30:27.074
Nothing.

30:28.702 --> 30:29.785
I don't get it.

30:33.540 --> 30:34.916
She knew.

30:35.876 --> 30:38.878
She knew that one day
I'd come back and bring others.

30:39.588 --> 30:41.964
So she abandoned this place,

30:42.049 --> 30:44.884
booby-trapped it
and moved on.

30:46.220 --> 30:48.554
Moved on where?

30:48.639 --> 30:50.890
Jack! Sayid!

30:52.476 --> 30:54.018
Do we know where we're going?

30:54.102 --> 30:56.354
The blast sounded like
it came from this way.

30:56.438 --> 30:58.814
- I think.
- You don't know.

30:58.899 --> 31:00.983
Dude, what do you want from me?

31:01.068 --> 31:04.529
What do I want? To know what
we're doing in the middle of nowhere.

31:04.613 --> 31:07.198
And don't tell me
it's because of some batteries.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.450
One minute you're
"good-time Hurley."

31:09.535 --> 31:11.202
The next you're Colonel Kurtz.

31:11.286 --> 31:13.996
It just doesn't make any sense.
It's not you.

31:14.081 --> 31:15.456
You don't know me.

31:15.541 --> 31:18.543
All this time, you've told me
nothing about yourself.

31:18.627 --> 31:21.546
- We all got personal stuff.
- Don't change the subject.

31:21.630 --> 31:23.089
We're lost out here.

31:23.173 --> 31:25.216
Jack and Sayid could be hurt,

31:25.300 --> 31:28.135
all because you're acting
like some bloody nutter.

31:30.138 --> 31:32.473
I am not crazy!

31:34.726 --> 31:38.938
- I've got my reasons for every...
- I think I have a right to know.

31:42.109 --> 31:43.568
Okay.

31:43.652 --> 31:46.112
- All right, you wanna know?
- Yeah.

31:47.990 --> 31:50.324
About a year ago...

31:54.997 --> 31:56.956
Is someone shooting at us?

32:20.856 --> 32:23.357
- You must be the French chick.
- Who are you?

32:23.483 --> 32:24.817
Hurley.

32:29.323 --> 32:32.366
Sayid, that guy you tortured...

32:33.869 --> 32:35.369
You were on the plane.

32:36.330 --> 32:39.874
Look, I came here to find... Easy.

32:43.045 --> 32:45.004
I'm just getting your notes.

32:52.554 --> 32:56.140
Please, tell me why you wrote this.

32:56.224 --> 32:58.392
What do these numbers mean?
Please.

33:01.146 --> 33:02.563
I don't know.

33:04.107 --> 33:05.107
What?

33:08.737 --> 33:10.237
You don't know?

33:11.114 --> 33:14.408
Okay, that thing in the woods...

33:16.703 --> 33:18.537
...maybe it's a monster,

33:18.622 --> 33:22.500
maybe it's a pissed-off giraffe.

33:22.584 --> 33:24.835
I don't know.

33:24.920 --> 33:29.173
The fact that no one
is even looking for us,

33:29.257 --> 33:31.759
yeah, that's weird.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.803
But I just go along with it.

33:33.887 --> 33:35.846
'Cause I'm along for the ride.

33:35.931 --> 33:39.350
Good old fun-time Hurley!

33:39.434 --> 33:41.852
Well, guess what?

33:41.937 --> 33:45.898
Now I want some freaking answers!

34:00.747 --> 34:04.625
Our ship picked up a transmission,

34:04.710 --> 34:07.044
a voice, repeating those numbers.

34:07.963 --> 34:10.172
We changed course to investigate.

34:10.799 --> 34:13.717
After we shipwrecked,

34:13.802 --> 34:16.887
my team continued to search
for the transmission source.

34:17.764 --> 34:20.306
It was weeks before
we found the radio tower.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.393
There's a radio tower on this island?

34:22.476 --> 34:25.730
Yes, up by the black rock.

34:28.150 --> 34:32.485
Some of us continued to search
for the meaning of those numbers

34:32.571 --> 34:34.989
while we waited for rescue.

34:35.614 --> 34:38.534
But then the sickness came.

34:38.618 --> 34:42.580
When my team was gone,

34:42.664 --> 34:46.083
I went back, up to the tower

34:46.168 --> 34:47.835
and changed the transmission.

34:49.004 --> 34:52.380
- That distress signal we heard.
- Yes.

34:52.466 --> 34:54.132
But the numbers...

34:57.179 --> 34:59.597
Did you ever find out
anything about them?

34:59.681 --> 35:02.099
Do you know where
they got their power?

35:02.184 --> 35:03.225
Power?

35:04.728 --> 35:08.856
They bring bad stuff
to everyone around you.

35:09.816 --> 35:12.651
They're cursed,
you know that, right?

35:13.612 --> 35:17.364
The numbers are cursed.

35:18.200 --> 35:20.701
The numbers are
what brought me here.

35:21.828 --> 35:26.081
As it appears, they've brought you.

35:28.043 --> 35:30.377
Since that time,

35:30.462 --> 35:33.756
I've lost everything,

35:33.840 --> 35:35.800
everyone I cared about.

35:37.344 --> 35:38.761
So, yes...

35:40.806 --> 35:43.140
...I suppose you're right.

35:43.225 --> 35:45.351
They are cursed.

35:48.772 --> 35:56.487
Thank you.

35:59.574 --> 36:02.284
You have no idea
how long I've been waiting

36:02.369 --> 36:04.411
for somebody to agree with me.

36:06.832 --> 36:09.208
Thank you!
Oh, God, thank you.

36:17.259 --> 36:19.802
We need to find
Hurley and Charlie,

36:19.886 --> 36:21.512
get out of this jungle.

36:22.806 --> 36:25.099
I hate that we're
going home empty-handed.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.354
Hey!

36:32.440 --> 36:34.441
Someone shot at us!
Hurley and me.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.694
- We were looking for you when...
- Rousseau.

36:36.778 --> 36:38.654
- Where's Hurley?
- I don't know.

36:38.738 --> 36:40.948
He was right behind me,
then he just...

36:41.032 --> 36:42.366
He just wasn't.

36:44.494 --> 36:46.787
- I'll go and find him.
- No.

36:46.872 --> 36:49.331
- We'll all go.
- Go where?

36:51.626 --> 36:53.544
What the hell happened to you?

36:57.257 --> 36:58.382
Need a battery?

37:02.554 --> 37:04.555
She says "Hey."

37:40.383 --> 37:42.176
You think of a name yet?

37:43.887 --> 37:45.679
For the baby.

37:46.681 --> 37:48.515
Haven't really thought about it.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.229
I was gonna give it away.

37:55.690 --> 37:57.900
You know, for adoption.

38:01.529 --> 38:04.531
- Must've been a difficult decision.
- Yeah.

38:06.910 --> 38:09.203
Well, doesn't matter now.

38:13.458 --> 38:14.917
It's my birthday today.

38:17.712 --> 38:19.588
Why haven't you told anyone?

38:19.673 --> 38:23.217
I'm pregnant, single

38:23.301 --> 38:25.844
and on an island
in the middle of nowhere.

38:26.471 --> 38:29.348
Doesn't really matter
that it's my birthday, does it?

38:31.101 --> 38:32.977
I guess not.

38:34.020 --> 38:36.647
Your birthdays will be close,
you and your baby.

38:36.731 --> 38:39.608
- That's good luck.
- Yeah? You think?

38:39.693 --> 38:41.151
Yeah, I do.

38:41.736 --> 38:45.656
You believe in that? Luck?

38:47.492 --> 38:49.368
I believe in a lot of things.

38:53.748 --> 38:55.666
That should do it.

38:55.750 --> 38:58.127
Okay. I give up.

38:58.878 --> 39:00.671
What is it?

39:13.601 --> 39:15.185
It's a cradle.

39:16.730 --> 39:18.897
Happy birthday, Claire.

39:21.943 --> 39:23.152
Thank you.

39:34.164 --> 39:37.458
I know food's scarce,
but your shirt?

39:38.418 --> 39:40.794
When you find a laundromat,
let me know.

39:51.139 --> 39:53.807
Back in the jungle,

39:53.892 --> 39:57.227
before we became target practice,
you were gonna tell me

39:57.312 --> 40:00.647
what inspired this little quest.

40:14.996 --> 40:17.539
I think the plane crash
might have been my fault.

40:17.624 --> 40:20.834
- Don't be daft. How could you...?
- Before we came here,

40:20.919 --> 40:25.255
a lot of bad stuff used to happen
whenever I was around.

40:25.340 --> 40:28.383
- What do you mean, like bad luck?
- Yeah...

40:28.468 --> 40:32.429
...that'd be kind of
a mellow way of describing it.

40:34.432 --> 40:36.767
Bad things happen.

40:36.851 --> 40:38.435
Planes crash. People die.

40:38.520 --> 40:40.187
You ought to let me finish.

40:40.271 --> 40:43.023
You think you're
the only person with baggage?

40:43.942 --> 40:46.568
You know what I was doing
when the plane went down?

40:48.196 --> 40:50.906
I was snorting heroin. In the toilet.

40:52.033 --> 40:54.701
I was such a junkie,

40:54.786 --> 40:57.704
I couldn't even take a plane ride
without having a fix.

40:57.789 --> 40:59.748
I suppose that was your fault as well?

41:08.591 --> 41:10.425
So how about it?

41:12.428 --> 41:13.762
What?

41:14.681 --> 41:17.057
I just told you
the biggest secret in my life.

41:17.142 --> 41:19.518
Thought you'd wanna reciprocate.

41:29.028 --> 41:30.195
Okay.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.159
Back home,

41:37.412 --> 41:41.165
I'm worth 156 million dollars.

41:51.217 --> 41:52.342
Fine. Don't tell me.

41:52.427 --> 41:55.095
- Dude.
- I bare my soul,

41:55.180 --> 41:57.764
and all I get is bloody jokes.
