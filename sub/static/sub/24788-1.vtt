02:49.937 --> 02:51.505
It's so fun running into you.

02:51.539 --> 02:53.073
So fun,
and I had to see this show

02:53.106 --> 02:56.510
before I went out of town. I mean,
look at this. Do you believe this place?

02:56.544 --> 02:58.812
So, you must be getting ready
for that end of year thingy.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.281
It is party time.

03:00.314 --> 03:01.982
Do you still bring pizza
for everybody?

03:02.015 --> 03:04.184
Sure. Because you did that
when we were students. So sweet.

03:04.218 --> 03:06.086
That was what,
a million years ago?

03:06.119 --> 03:08.689
Thank you for reminding me,
and yes I do.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.358
It's a highlight of
the semester.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.192
Do you let them drink
at the thing?

03:12.226 --> 03:14.027
Absolutely not,
did I let you guys drink?

03:14.061 --> 03:15.929
I was drunk. I don't know
who was letting me drink but...

03:15.963 --> 03:17.465
It's horrifying.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.333
So what are your summer plans?

03:19.367 --> 03:21.702
(SIGHS) My summer's kind of
shaping up to be a mess.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.471
Basically,
so I'm in the Biennale...

03:23.504 --> 03:24.738
Oh, great!

03:24.772 --> 03:26.807
So I have to be in Europe
between my two installations. Oh!

03:26.840 --> 03:29.377
But then I've got the fall show
at my New York gallery,

03:29.410 --> 03:31.812
so any moment I'm not there,
I'm in my studio,

03:31.845 --> 03:33.514
which means
I can't spend any time

03:33.547 --> 03:35.516
on the North Fork with
my boyfriend which is, like,

03:35.549 --> 03:37.385
just this whole other mess
because

03:37.418 --> 03:39.152
he's feeling so neglected,
in all these different ways.

03:39.186 --> 03:41.522
And so, like, I wouldn't
schedule a fall show again.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.023
I think it's brutal.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.358
Oh, that sounds...

03:44.392 --> 03:45.393
Brutal.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.328
What are you up to?

03:47.361 --> 03:49.530
I am house-sitting
for Logan Sheiler.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.198
And I'm gonna work
in her studio,

03:51.231 --> 03:53.166
and kinda chill out,
after the semester and

03:53.200 --> 03:54.735
just kind of get the country
vibe going a little bit...

03:54.768 --> 03:56.604
She's so nice.
She's such a good artist.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.606

once you get to Europe

04:09.650 --> 04:11.685

and get some rest.

I want to go to the next place.

31:31.323 --> 31:32.324
Okay.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.761
All right, Ellie,
I'm confused.

31:35.794 --> 31:37.196
Help me to understand this.

31:37.229 --> 31:39.465
Am I gonna mimic Clark Gable?

31:39.498 --> 31:42.734
Or am I gonna do an interpretation
of the scene, my own?

31:42.768 --> 31:44.803
Or is it a combination of both?
What is it?

31:46.738 --> 31:48.507
You can never be Clark Gable.

31:48.540 --> 31:50.576
I can never be Marilyn Monroe.

31:51.343 --> 31:52.778
It's about...

31:52.811 --> 31:55.514
It's exactly about
the impossibility of us...

31:57.049 --> 32:00.419
Ever being able to be them.
We can never be them.

32:00.452 --> 32:02.388
But let's just try it,
just do it with me.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.890
I just want to see
what it looks like.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.293
Okay. You're the artist.

32:07.326 --> 32:08.394
Let's do it.

32:09.695 --> 32:11.430
Uh, you're driving,
by the way.

32:11.463 --> 32:13.099
Holy cannoli, you're right.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.535
FRANK: (WHISPERING)
I'm driving...

32:24.010 --> 32:26.745
(MOVIE SOUNDTRACK PLAYING)

32:28.080 --> 32:30.182
You're a real beautiful woman.

32:33.185 --> 32:36.422
It's almost kind of an honor,
sitting next to you.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.490
You just shine in my eyes.

32:39.658 --> 32:41.493
That's my true feeling,
Roslyn.

32:46.598 --> 32:48.167
What makes you so sad?

32:49.335 --> 32:51.803
I think you're the saddest girl
I ever met.

32:51.837 --> 32:54.506
You're the first man that's,
ever said that to me.

32:55.374 --> 32:57.776
Usually I'm told I'm happy.

32:57.809 --> 33:01.213
Well, that's because,
you make a man feel happy.

33:04.450 --> 33:07.286
I don't feel,
that way about you, Gay.

33:12.191 --> 33:14.493
Now, don't get
discouraged, girl.

33:14.526 --> 33:16.062
You might.

33:17.796 --> 33:19.565
Listen...

33:19.598 --> 33:23.369
Why don't you try it out here,
for a while, see what happens?

33:23.402 --> 33:26.172
You know, sometimes a person,
don't know what to do,

33:26.205 --> 33:28.807
best thing to do
is to stand still.

33:31.043 --> 33:32.911
I guarantee you'll have,
something out here

33:32.944 --> 33:34.680
you wouldn't find,
on every corner.

33:36.415 --> 33:37.483
And I here...

33:38.650 --> 33:41.353
May not amount to much,
in some ways but...

33:42.388 --> 33:44.090
I'm a good friend.

33:45.824 --> 33:46.892
Thanks.

33:49.195 --> 33:50.662
(CAR STARTING)

33:50.696 --> 33:52.131
Let's go back,
get your things,

33:52.164 --> 33:54.200
try it out for a while,
see what happens.

33:56.902 --> 34:00.038
You ever hear that story about,
the city man out in the country?

34:00.072 --> 34:01.640
Sees this fella,
sitting out on the porch,

34:01.673 --> 34:03.342
and he goes, "Hey, Mister".

34:04.510 --> 34:07.213
"Could you tell me,
how to get back to town?"

34:07.246 --> 34:08.980
Fella says, "Nope."

34:09.014 --> 34:12.518
He says "Well, can you tell me,
where the post office is?"

34:13.185 --> 34:15.420
Fella says, "Nope."

34:15.454 --> 34:18.190
"Can you tell me how,
to get to the rail road station?"

34:18.224 --> 34:19.625
Fella says, "Nope."

34:19.658 --> 34:21.260
"Boy," he says.

34:21.293 --> 34:23.695
"You don't know much at all,
do you?"

34:23.728 --> 34:26.565
Fella says,
"Nope. But I ain't lost."

34:27.565 --> 34:29.201
(LAUGHING)

34:30.768 --> 34:31.770
(MOVIE SOUNDTRACK CONTINUES)

34:59.030 --> 35:00.366
Well, good evening.
Hey.

35:00.399 --> 35:02.734
How are you this evening?
Well, thank you.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.002
Good evening, sir.

35:04.035 --> 35:06.638
Can you open this?
I'll take care of you, sir.

35:06.672 --> 35:08.474
Right this way to your table.

35:17.816 --> 35:19.551
WAITER: It's lovely
to see you.

35:19.585 --> 35:20.752
You too.

35:20.786 --> 35:21.853
Sir...

35:21.887 --> 35:23.389
My daughter Becky
will be waiting on you.

35:23.422 --> 35:24.490
She'll be with you shortly.

35:24.523 --> 35:26.558
Thank you.
Thanks.

35:26.592 --> 35:29.495
This is really the only place,
I know around here.

35:29.528 --> 35:32.598
Seems like it's the only place,
everybody knows around here.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.900
It's good, it's really good.

35:34.933 --> 35:36.034
BECKY: Your champagne.

35:36.067 --> 35:37.336
Thank you.

35:38.604 --> 35:40.206
And are you all set?
Yes.

35:40.239 --> 35:41.473
What can I get for you?

35:41.507 --> 35:43.909
I would like the burger,
medium rare please.

35:44.676 --> 35:45.777
And for you, sir?

35:45.811 --> 35:48.380
I will have the duck l'orange.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.350
BECKY: Mashed potato,
baked potato, or rice?

35:51.383 --> 35:52.618
Okay.

35:52.651 --> 35:54.152
BECKY: Excuse me?
All three.

35:55.287 --> 35:57.155
I've been on a diet.

35:57.189 --> 35:59.325
Tonight, I splurge.

36:00.025 --> 36:01.460
Go for it.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.163
That's good, thank you.

36:10.135 --> 36:13.472
Usually, the girls
I go out with, they're, um...

36:13.505 --> 36:14.940
30-something.

36:15.841 --> 36:17.476
Maybe 40-something.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.112
Well, that's interesting,

36:21.146 --> 36:22.681
cause I am...

36:24.716 --> 36:25.984
Yeah.

36:26.318 --> 36:27.519
M.A.

36:27.553 --> 36:28.554
M.A.?

36:28.854 --> 36:29.955
My age.

36:30.322 --> 36:31.723
Oh jeez.

36:31.757 --> 36:34.860
So, you're up here making art.

36:36.027 --> 36:38.930
Tommy talks about you
all the time.

36:38.964 --> 36:41.032
The kid's obsessed
with the '80s.

36:41.066 --> 36:43.168
Says you're a genius teacher.

36:46.538 --> 36:49.975
He makes my job really easy,
he's really a cool kid.

36:50.008 --> 36:52.944
It's really sweet of him,
to do this for me,

36:52.978 --> 36:55.681
considering his mother and I
are not on the best of terms.

36:55.714 --> 36:57.549
I thought, I really, I needed a

36:57.583 --> 36:59.685
parent-teacher conference.

37:01.420 --> 37:03.054
I wanted to ask you
if you think he can make

37:03.088 --> 37:04.856
a living as an artist?

37:04.890 --> 37:06.892
I'm not sure that's really,
the question, I mean...

37:07.993 --> 37:10.862
The kid's obsessed,
he's focused,

37:10.896 --> 37:13.164
he loves
being in school and...

37:13.198 --> 37:14.566
That's a relief.

37:22.641 --> 37:24.643
(CHA-CHA MUSIC PLAYING)

37:25.644 --> 37:27.045
I gotta go...

37:28.046 --> 37:29.615
To the little boy's room.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.929
Let me show you a little step
I learned in L.A.

37:44.396 --> 37:45.464
Watch this.

37:51.069 --> 37:53.271
Now first,
you gotta set the rhythm.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.681
I wish I could do this.

38:17.463 --> 38:18.997
Dancing, it's my thing.

38:19.030 --> 38:20.966
And ladies.

38:20.999 --> 38:24.302
My father used to say,
"Cha-cha is an asset to music."

38:25.170 --> 38:27.839
Get it?
It's an "Ass" set to music.

38:27.873 --> 38:29.575
C'mon.

41:09.167 --> 41:10.335
Good night.
(SIGHING)

41:14.205 --> 41:15.941
Well... (EXCLAIMS)

41:20.478 --> 41:22.748
You wanna drive home?
Honey, please.

41:22.781 --> 41:23.982
Can you?

41:24.015 --> 41:25.884
Let me in, I want to come in.
No...

41:25.917 --> 41:28.319
I want to hold you.
No.

41:28.353 --> 41:30.121
You want to get in the car.
Can you drive?

41:30.155 --> 41:32.758
Can I drive?
That is the question.

41:32.791 --> 41:35.393
Yes, I can drive, I can...

41:43.802 --> 41:46.404
Wait there, I'm getting you,
a cup of coffee.

42:02.353 --> 42:04.322
(KNOCKING)

42:04.355 --> 42:05.490
Hello?

42:08.526 --> 42:10.528
I think you might need this.

42:11.797 --> 42:12.964
Thank you.

42:13.899 --> 42:16.802
Looks like, uh,
I slept in your driveway.

42:16.835 --> 42:17.903
You did.

42:18.970 --> 42:21.039
But I'm relieved,
actually, because

42:21.072 --> 42:22.774
it would've been criminal
of me to let you drive off

42:22.808 --> 42:24.175
that way last night.

42:24.976 --> 42:26.177
Didn't go anywhere.

42:27.545 --> 42:29.815
You wanna come in,
for some breakfast?

42:29.848 --> 42:30.982
Yeah.

42:31.016 --> 42:32.217
Come on.

42:43.294 --> 42:45.030
Wanna hear a great joke?
Yeah.

42:45.063 --> 42:46.564
Okay, so this Jewish kid

42:46.598 --> 42:48.533
comes home from school one day,
and he says to his mother,

42:48.566 --> 42:51.637
"Hey, mom, I got a part
in the school play."

42:51.670 --> 42:53.571
She said "Oh that's great honey,
what's the part?"

42:53.605 --> 42:55.506
He says "The Jewish husband."

42:55.540 --> 42:58.576
She says, "You march right
back to that school,

42:58.610 --> 43:00.679
"And you demand
a speaking role."

43:01.747 --> 43:03.148
(LAUGHING) That's terrible!

43:03.882 --> 43:05.751
You were
the mute Jewish husband.

43:06.017 --> 43:07.152
Yes?

43:07.185 --> 43:08.386
Which marriage?

43:08.419 --> 43:09.554
The Jewish wife?

43:10.021 --> 43:11.522
The Jewish wife?

43:11.556 --> 43:12.590

43:12.624 --> 43:14.225
You have a backstory, huh?

43:14.259 --> 43:15.627
Pretty dark actually.

no big deal.

No.

43:22.968 --> 43:25.003

43:25.036 --> 43:27.205
my fantastic dog, Bing.

43:27.906 --> 43:29.007
Mmm-hmm?
Love dogs.

43:29.040 --> 43:30.776
A lot easier than wives.

43:30.809 --> 43:32.878
That's unacceptable.
I know.

Hey, Frank!

Gorgeous day.

43:40.919 --> 43:42.287
What's with him?

43:42.320 --> 43:44.823

don't pay any attention.

C'mon, buddy!

45:05.236 --> 45:07.272
You're William Powell.
Okay.

45:07.305 --> 45:08.740
You've taken
a fishing expedition

45:08.774 --> 45:11.042
to the Caribbean,
with your wife.

45:11.076 --> 45:12.577
ELLIE: You go out
in your boat one day,

45:13.178 --> 45:14.980
you catch a mermaid.

45:15.013 --> 45:17.115
You bring her back
to the hotel.

45:17.148 --> 45:19.117
You stash her in the pool.

45:19.150 --> 45:21.686
You visit her secretly,
every single day.

45:21.719 --> 45:25.656
She's young,
she's beautiful and she's mute.

45:25.690 --> 45:28.293
She has not one word of dialogue

45:28.326 --> 45:30.328
throughout the entire movie.

45:30.361 --> 45:32.497
Yet you feel
she understands you

45:32.530 --> 45:34.933
far more than your wife
ever could.

45:36.434 --> 45:38.036
And that is you.

45:39.037 --> 45:40.071
Okay.

45:41.406 --> 45:43.241
(EXHALES)

45:43.274 --> 45:44.509
Away we go.

45:44.542 --> 45:47.512
My age doesn't mean
anything to you, does it?

45:47.545 --> 45:50.581
You don't think 50 is
so conclusive, do you?

45:51.282 --> 45:53.051
No, course not.

45:53.618 --> 45:55.053
Why should you?

45:55.086 --> 45:57.155
I mean,
what is really so dreadful

45:57.188 --> 45:59.424
about a few gray hairs?

45:59.457 --> 46:01.960
Suppose a man
doesn't make a

46:01.993 --> 46:04.896
public spectacle of himself,
running up stairs? Well...

46:06.464 --> 46:08.599
What is so admirable about

46:08.633 --> 46:10.936
running up stairs like a fool?

46:10.969 --> 46:12.237
And suppose he does

46:12.270 --> 46:14.439
get a little sleepy,
in a nightclub?

46:15.373 --> 46:17.976
The truth of the matter is,

46:18.009 --> 46:22.380
at 50, a man is
at the very peak of his faculties.

46:22.413 --> 46:24.950
Any doctor
will tell you that.

46:24.983 --> 46:28.086
Why, at 50, a man
develops understanding,

46:29.154 --> 46:30.221
sympathy,

46:30.788 --> 46:31.857
tenderness.

46:33.324 --> 46:36.727
He appreciates,
a beauty such as yours,

46:36.761 --> 46:39.397
such as a younger man,
could not do.

46:39.931 --> 46:41.833
It is a beauty...

46:41.867 --> 46:45.703
That is like a child's,
it's simple, it's direct.

46:47.505 --> 46:51.442
It's uncomplicated,
just the way that you love me.

46:51.476 --> 46:54.012
Why, with such a love,

46:54.045 --> 46:56.614
how could a man feel,
anything but younger?

46:59.617 --> 47:01.286
'Tis sweet and commendable

47:01.319 --> 47:03.088
in your nature, Hamlet.

47:03.121 --> 47:05.256
To give these mourning duties
to your father.

47:05.290 --> 47:06.791
But, you must know,

47:06.824 --> 47:08.026
your father lost a father.

47:08.960 --> 47:10.428
That father lost his

47:10.996 --> 47:12.463
and the survivor bound

47:12.497 --> 47:14.565
in filial obligation,
for some term

47:14.599 --> 47:16.401
to do obsequious sorrow.

47:16.434 --> 47:18.303
But to persevere

47:18.336 --> 47:20.305
in obstinate condolement,
is a course

47:20.338 --> 47:22.240
of impious stubbornness.

47:22.273 --> 47:24.509
'Tis unmanly grief.

47:25.210 --> 47:27.345
(FRANK LAUGHING)

47:27.378 --> 47:28.880
Damn man, that's so cool,

47:28.914 --> 47:30.415
you can do Shakespeare
just like that.

47:30.448 --> 47:32.450
You're really good.
Dude, you could play Hamlet.

47:32.483 --> 47:34.119
I can't play Hamlet.
Sure you could.

47:34.152 --> 47:36.287
I can't do iambic pentameter.
I can't, I've tried.

47:36.321 --> 47:38.489
You know, I didn't tell you,
I've been workin' with Ellie,

47:38.523 --> 47:40.058
with some of her stuff.

47:40.091 --> 47:41.859
Stuff? What does that mean?

47:41.893 --> 47:43.794
Yeah, I've been workin',
kinda workin' with her art.

47:43.828 --> 47:45.396
What art? What does that mean?
What kind of art?

47:47.999 --> 47:49.500
I don't know,
what the fuck it is

47:49.534 --> 47:51.369
but it's hard to explain kinda,
it's a...

47:51.402 --> 47:52.703
Kinda...

47:53.304 --> 47:54.305
(EXCLAIMS)

47:54.872 --> 47:56.607
What do you mean?

47:56.641 --> 48:00.345
Well, it's kinda,
different and strange.

48:00.378 --> 48:02.713
You keep sayin' "Kinda"
every time you talk.

48:02.747 --> 48:04.015
I do?
Yeah, you do, you do.

48:04.049 --> 48:05.150
You kinda do.

48:05.183 --> 48:06.751
You're acting,
just tell me you're acting.

48:06.784 --> 48:08.286
That's fine.

48:08.319 --> 48:11.389
I hate not working, man,
I miss it, I miss working.

48:11.422 --> 48:13.358
I need to be working.
It sucks.

48:13.391 --> 48:14.892
We're actors, dude.

48:14.926 --> 48:16.327
We're actors.
Actors need to act.

48:16.361 --> 48:17.762
You're acting right now.

48:17.795 --> 48:19.297
I'm not an actor,
I'm a gardener.

48:19.330 --> 48:21.232
You're a gardener who acts.

48:21.266 --> 48:22.400
No.
Right?

48:22.433 --> 48:23.834
I'm a gardener, too.

48:23.868 --> 48:25.036
Okay, so we're both gardeners.

48:25.070 --> 48:27.038
And you are also acting
right now.

48:27.072 --> 48:30.075
Just ask Ellie if you can be,
in one of her things.

48:30.541 --> 48:31.742
No.

49:25.763 --> 49:27.965
ELLIE: (WITH SOUTHERN ACCENT)
One day, I carried 30 pounds of wood

49:27.999 --> 49:29.500
a distance of 5 miles.

49:38.743 --> 49:40.878
Another day,
while hiding in the forest,

49:40.911 --> 49:42.613
I covered my eyes with makeup

49:42.647 --> 49:44.949
to see how they'd come out.

50:23.054 --> 50:25.290
(YELLING) Hey, Stella!

50:25.323 --> 50:27.358
You quit that howling down there
and go to bed.

50:27.392 --> 50:30.027
Eunice, I want
my girl down here.

50:30.061 --> 50:32.597
You shut up.
You're gonna get the law on you.

50:32.630 --> 50:34.365
(YELLING) Hey Stella!

50:35.633 --> 50:36.967
Stella!

50:38.836 --> 50:39.870
Oh, my God.

50:39.904 --> 50:41.239
Yeah, right?

50:41.272 --> 50:44.041
You are so amazing at Brando.

50:44.075 --> 50:45.876
Have you done Stanley before?

50:45.910 --> 50:47.778
I mean Brando and I
share the same birthday, so, like,

50:47.812 --> 50:49.714
when I was in drama school,
I used to do him and then

50:49.747 --> 50:52.550
I did him a bunch regionally,
when I was younger.

50:52.583 --> 50:55.220
I hear,
you really like being Marilyn?

50:55.253 --> 50:58.022
Who told you that?
Frank told me.

50:58.055 --> 51:00.425
You guys talk about me?
Of course, yeah.

51:03.128 --> 51:04.829
Is something wrong with that?

51:04.862 --> 51:06.264
No, right?

51:06.297 --> 51:07.298
Well, no.

51:08.566 --> 51:12.503
You know, I googled,
"How old is Blanche DuBois?"

51:12.537 --> 51:15.005
Cause I've seen her played
by actresses

51:15.039 --> 51:18.008
48, 44, even 50.

51:18.042 --> 51:19.344
That makes sense, yeah.

51:19.377 --> 51:21.712
Tennessee Williams wrote her
to be 30.

51:21.746 --> 51:23.681
30 years old?
Yes.

51:23.714 --> 51:25.850
She felt like
her life was over.

51:26.417 --> 51:27.418
That's crazy.

51:28.553 --> 51:30.188
My wife is 40.

51:30.221 --> 51:31.289
Really?
Uh-huh.

51:32.623 --> 51:33.758
She's beautiful.

51:33.791 --> 51:35.993
Yeah, I like older women.

51:36.026 --> 51:37.862
I'm sure she'd love being,
described that way.

51:37.895 --> 51:39.697
I didn't mean older like that,

51:39.730 --> 51:42.233
I meant older just like,
she's older than me.

51:42.900 --> 51:44.068
You know.

51:44.101 --> 51:45.770
It doesn't matter.

51:45.803 --> 51:47.605
She doesn't like me anymore.

51:47.638 --> 51:49.073
What?

51:49.106 --> 51:50.408
Yeah, she doesn't like me.

51:50.441 --> 51:51.776
How can that be true?

51:51.809 --> 51:53.878
Gotta ask her,
she doesn't like me no more.

51:55.646 --> 51:57.348
Edie, you love me.

51:59.150 --> 52:01.018
Edie, you love me,
I wanna hear you say it.

52:01.051 --> 52:02.253
What?

52:02.287 --> 52:03.554
Edie, I wanna hear you say it,

52:03.588 --> 52:05.089
I wanna hear you say
you love me.

52:07.692 --> 52:09.694
What's that from?
On the Waterfront.

52:10.094 --> 52:11.496
Oh.

52:11.529 --> 52:13.130
Maybe we should do that.

52:26.444 --> 52:29.180
(DEEP BREATHING)

52:32.550 --> 52:34.252
(LAUGHTER)

52:35.853 --> 52:36.854
Ellie...

52:37.822 --> 52:39.156
I don't see the point of doing

52:39.190 --> 52:40.458
Jules and Jim

52:40.491 --> 52:42.327
if you're not doing it
in French.

52:42.360 --> 52:43.994
I don't want
any language in it.

52:44.028 --> 52:46.297
I think of it as
a movie that's about

52:46.331 --> 52:49.267
the subtitles just as much as
it's about the imagery.

52:49.300 --> 52:51.602
It's black and white,
it's moody.

52:51.636 --> 52:54.171
But every other video you've made
you did it verbatim.

52:54.205 --> 52:55.606
I mean we recreated
the characters,

52:55.640 --> 52:58.509
we did it exactly as it was
in the movie and now?

52:58.543 --> 53:01.712
I mean it's just wrong,
I mean it's kind of sacrilegious

53:01.746 --> 53:04.148
to do "Jules and Jim"
and not use the French.

53:04.181 --> 53:07.652
I can't believe, you're actually
telling me how to make my work.

53:07.685 --> 53:10.087
And also, you can sound,
a little bit pretentious,

53:10.120 --> 53:12.022
no offense.
(SIGHING)

53:12.056 --> 53:14.325
And also, by the way,

53:14.359 --> 53:15.960
you guys are kind of
working for me.

53:15.993 --> 53:18.663
Whoa, wait right there.

53:18.696 --> 53:21.165
No, we're not working for you,
we're helping you out.

53:21.198 --> 53:22.867
I work for Logan, okay?

53:22.900 --> 53:24.101
I'm helping you out,

53:24.134 --> 53:25.636
John's helping you out,
Tom's helping you out,

53:25.670 --> 53:27.572
with your work
and your art, right?

53:27.605 --> 53:31.342
You don't have to defend me, man, I just,
I really, really wanna speak French.

53:31.376 --> 53:33.478
I'm having a ball.

53:33.511 --> 53:36.414
If you guys wanna talk about me,
like I'm not here,

53:36.447 --> 53:37.748
I'm gonna make it possible.

53:37.782 --> 53:38.949
He's havin' a ball.

53:38.983 --> 53:40.184
We're havin' a ball.

53:40.585 --> 53:42.152
Geez.

53:42.853 --> 53:44.221
A little pissy?

53:45.256 --> 53:46.591
Artistic temperament.

53:46.624 --> 53:48.192
Oy.

53:48.225 --> 53:51.329
You know, if I could've been,
a French movie actor,

53:51.362 --> 53:54.332
I never would have been,
a lawyer.

53:54.365 --> 53:57.201
(SIGHS) Didn't have the guts
to follow my bliss.

53:57.802 --> 53:59.437
But you...

53:59.470 --> 54:02.340
You're such a good actor.
Why'd you quit?

54:02.373 --> 54:05.576
Oh, I didn't quit,
I just took a break, you know.

54:06.176 --> 54:07.512
Things happened.

54:07.545 --> 54:09.146
I might get back into it.

54:09.179 --> 54:11.148
I'm starting to get,
the bug again. You know.

54:11.181 --> 54:12.317
We'll see.

54:12.350 --> 54:14.852
But you?
You're a big trial lawyer.

54:14.885 --> 54:17.955
The Spencer Tracy,
Gregory Peck type, huh?

54:18.789 --> 54:20.625
Made a little money but

54:20.658 --> 54:23.428
I didn't have this, you know?

54:23.461 --> 54:27.932
I mean the joy of
this last few days.

54:27.965 --> 54:30.234
Yeah, it's fun, isn't it?
It is fun.

54:30.267 --> 54:32.202
Shouldn't been a pussy
when you started out.

54:32.236 --> 54:33.304
You're right.

55:29.326 --> 55:31.629
ELLIE: There was me,
that is Alex

55:31.662 --> 55:33.297
and my three droogs,

55:33.330 --> 55:36.434
that is Pete,
Georgie, and Dim.

55:37.835 --> 55:39.704
And we sat in the Korova Milkbar

55:39.737 --> 55:41.772
trying to make up,
our rassoodocks

55:41.806 --> 55:44.274
what to do with the evening.

55:44.308 --> 55:46.744
The Korova Milkbar,
sold milk-plus,

55:47.378 --> 55:48.946
milk plus vellocet,

55:48.979 --> 55:50.481
or synthemesc,

55:51.315 --> 55:52.717
or drencrom,

55:52.750 --> 55:54.819
which is what we were drinking.

55:54.852 --> 55:56.787
This would sharpen you up.

55:56.821 --> 55:58.623
and make you ready for

55:58.656 --> 56:01.559
a bit of the old ultra-violence.

56:18.776 --> 56:20.210
Piewacket.

56:22.312 --> 56:23.614
You know it's funny,

56:23.648 --> 56:25.049
but all my life

56:25.082 --> 56:27.184
I've either been too busy

56:27.217 --> 56:29.754
or too careful to get married,

56:29.787 --> 56:32.423
and now all of a sudden,
I just...

56:33.190 --> 56:34.892
I just can't wait.

56:35.560 --> 56:37.194
I just can't wait.

56:38.328 --> 56:41.331
Uh, you know...
(CHUCKLING)

56:42.900 --> 56:45.002
Sort of like somebody...

56:45.035 --> 56:46.737
Reading over your shoulder
all the time.

56:46.771 --> 56:47.838
(COUGHING)

56:47.872 --> 56:50.074
You know, I think
I'm allergic to your cat.

56:50.741 --> 56:52.176
(COUGHING)

56:52.209 --> 56:55.746
Well, if it'd been anybody else,
but Merle,

56:55.780 --> 57:01.619
(VOICE FADING OUT) Well,
I would've been scared stiff.

57:02.620 --> 57:05.490
But, you know for one thing,

57:05.523 --> 57:07.458
she has wonderful taste...

57:07.992 --> 57:09.393
(PURRING)

57:09.994 --> 57:12.763
(HUMMING)

57:20.705 --> 57:21.706
(PURRING AND HUMMING CONTINUE)

57:27.344 --> 57:30.615
I've sort of...
Rattling, haven't I?

57:32.349 --> 57:34.051
Well, you know...

57:34.084 --> 57:35.586
It's getting late.

57:35.620 --> 57:37.321
I think I'd better go up.

57:39.624 --> 57:41.559
Thank you, for the drink.

57:44.962 --> 57:47.998
(HUMMING)

57:56.574 --> 57:58.242
You know...
(Clears THROAT)

57:58.275 --> 58:02.747
Tomorrow is gonna be
quite an important day for me,

58:02.780 --> 58:03.814
I mean today.

58:05.182 --> 58:07.818
Today is
quite an important day, I...

58:07.852 --> 58:10.320
So, um,
if you'll excuse me, I.

58:10.354 --> 58:12.823
(HUMMING CONTINUES)

58:17.227 --> 58:18.996
That...

58:19.029 --> 58:22.432
What is that tune,
you're humming?

58:22.466 --> 58:25.369
It's just a little something
I sing to Pie now and then.

58:26.937 --> 58:28.005
Oh. All right.

58:56.033 --> 58:58.869
(MOVIE SOUNDTRACK INTENSIFIES)

59:23.761 --> 59:26.163
Jab, jab, jab, jab!

59:26.196 --> 59:28.232
No, keep that right up!

59:28.265 --> 59:30.567
There you go! Move! Easy! Easy!

59:30.601 --> 59:32.236
Slow down, slow down,
slow down!

59:32.269 --> 59:33.503
There you go, but keep that right up!
Ow!

59:33.537 --> 59:35.640
- There you go, there you go!
- No...

59:35.673 --> 59:37.541
Jab! Double jab, double jab.

59:38.542 --> 59:40.911
No, keep that one up!
She's gonna get hit!

59:40.945 --> 59:44.581
Ow! I don't like this,
at all.

59:44.615 --> 59:46.250
I find it violent.

59:46.283 --> 59:48.252
It is violent,
but you're not competing,

59:48.285 --> 59:49.854
it's exercise.

59:49.887 --> 59:51.388
C'mon, Ellie!

59:51.421 --> 59:54.058
It's for empowerment
and for stress...

59:54.091 --> 59:55.525
You're gonna smoke?
Yeah.

59:55.559 --> 59:57.361
Oh my God,
that's disgusting.

59:57.394 --> 01:00:00.030
Yeah, but I'm quitting
when the summer's over.

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:03.433
I love cigarettes.

01:00:05.502 --> 01:00:06.904
In fact,

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:10.240
if I could wake up every day and
have an ashtray next to my bed

01:00:10.274 --> 01:00:12.076
with a cigarette and lighter,

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:13.711
I would be a happy girl.

01:00:13.744 --> 01:00:15.112
Like after sex.

01:00:15.145 --> 01:00:16.480
No.

01:00:16.513 --> 01:00:18.248
And after that,

01:00:18.282 --> 01:00:21.218
I would want my breakfast coffee
with a donut on the weekdays,

01:00:21.251 --> 01:00:24.454
and bacon and eggs
on the weekends.

01:00:24.488 --> 01:00:26.657
Which would
lead me up to lunch,

01:00:26.691 --> 01:00:29.193
where I'd have
a cheeseburger,

01:00:29.226 --> 01:00:31.762
an order of fries
and a small coke.

01:00:31.796 --> 01:00:33.463
Man food.
Exactly.

01:00:34.331 --> 01:00:35.565
My favorite.

01:00:35.599 --> 01:00:36.633
Yeah.

01:00:36.667 --> 01:00:38.368
Ah... Man.

01:00:41.238 --> 01:00:43.073
I miss my wife.

01:00:43.107 --> 01:00:45.509
You know, Frank, you've,
mentioned that like 500 times.

Well, I'm sorry, it must be tough,
to get used to living alone.

Yeah, well,
I don't feel lonely with you.

01:00:54.084 --> 01:00:55.686

She was so happy, she cried.

never have children!

01:04:40.644 --> 01:04:42.212
We can adopt some.

01:10:40.770 --> 01:10:42.238
Oh, so you're an
art critic now?

01:10:42.272 --> 01:10:44.140
I don't know what I am.

01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:46.743
But, gotta get some sleep.

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:51.214
Tomorrow is another day.

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:52.582
Oh my God.

01:10:52.616 --> 01:10:54.551
Something like that.

01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:56.586
Thanks.
Yeah, good night.

01:11:34.858 --> 01:11:36.626
Hey, goofball.

01:12:07.056 --> 01:12:09.325
Probably want a cigarette now,
don't you?

01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:11.661
No... (BOTH LAUGHING)

01:12:13.463 --> 01:12:14.631
Good.

01:12:37.721 --> 01:12:39.288
Bing?

01:12:41.324 --> 01:12:42.659
Bing?

01:12:44.728 --> 01:12:45.962
You okay?

01:12:45.995 --> 01:12:47.363
I don't know where Bing is.

01:12:48.665 --> 01:12:49.699
Bing?

01:12:51.901 --> 01:12:53.537
What's going on, buddy?

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:02.479
What's up, buddy boy?

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:05.181
Why are you down here?

01:13:05.214 --> 01:13:06.750
What's goin' on?

01:13:16.192 --> 01:13:17.427
Everything okay?

01:13:18.962 --> 01:13:20.664
I need to get him to a vet.

01:13:23.867 --> 01:13:26.035
FRANK: Okay, I'll get my keys.

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:20.524
I can't stop thinking...

01:14:20.557 --> 01:14:25.228
About how weird it's been
in the last 24 hours.

01:14:25.261 --> 01:14:26.963
What do you mean?
Just...

01:14:28.097 --> 01:14:30.466
Like, everything happening
all at once.

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:32.168
That's what it feels like.

01:14:36.773 --> 01:14:39.909
I have this like, little voice
that keeps...

01:14:41.377 --> 01:14:43.913
Nagging at me like...

01:14:43.947 --> 01:14:46.983
You think God could be,
punishing me for something?

01:14:47.016 --> 01:14:48.351
(LAUGHING) For what?

01:14:49.686 --> 01:14:51.020
C'mon.

01:14:52.922 --> 01:14:54.591
Are you religious?

01:14:54.624 --> 01:14:55.725
No.

01:14:55.759 --> 01:14:57.360
Well, there you go.
Obviously not...

01:15:05.602 --> 01:15:08.171
He is a super cool dog, right?

01:15:08.204 --> 01:15:09.472
He's a great dog.

01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:12.041
I loved him.

01:15:12.075 --> 01:15:13.777
And he loved you.

01:15:13.810 --> 01:15:14.944
You know?

01:15:14.978 --> 01:15:17.614
Great dog. Sweet.

01:15:17.647 --> 01:15:20.650
You don't think he's all I had,
like, on an emotional level,

01:15:20.684 --> 01:15:22.151
on a personal level, do you?

01:15:22.185 --> 01:15:23.452
No.

01:15:23.486 --> 01:15:25.655
Cause I have my work and
I have my friends...

01:15:25.689 --> 01:15:27.657
Of course, no...
My life.

01:15:27.691 --> 01:15:29.693
I wasn't thinking that at all.

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:33.597
I did think that, you know,

01:15:33.630 --> 01:15:35.031
maybe you wanted
something more.

01:15:35.064 --> 01:15:38.802
You know, that you
liked it here, and that...

01:15:38.835 --> 01:15:40.937
You liked this little corner
of the world and,

01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:43.539
that maybe, you know...

01:15:45.675 --> 01:15:48.712
Oh, I love it here for when

01:15:49.345 --> 01:15:50.780
New York is under water-

01:15:50.814 --> 01:15:54.618
and everyone's wearing gas masks
and carrying AK-37s...

01:15:54.651 --> 01:15:55.985
47s.

01:15:56.019 --> 01:15:58.988
And the world has gone to
fucking hell in a hand basket.

01:15:59.022 --> 01:16:02.358
It's safe and soft,
and kind here.

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:04.661
It is, totally, I totally...

01:16:04.694 --> 01:16:05.995
Yes.

01:16:06.596 --> 01:16:07.964
What's the matter?

01:16:07.997 --> 01:16:09.833
I'm sorry, nothing.

01:16:09.866 --> 01:16:12.568
I just think,
I need to take a few.

01:16:12.602 --> 01:16:14.537
Like, I just need to kinda...

01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:17.206
Gather my...

01:16:29.619 --> 01:16:30.620
(DOOR CLOSES)

01:16:41.564 --> 01:16:44.433
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

01:16:47.804 --> 01:16:49.305
Bing died.

01:16:49.338 --> 01:16:51.775
Bing, oh...

01:16:51.808 --> 01:16:53.242
Bing died? Uh...

01:16:53.276 --> 01:16:56.880
He was so old, um,
he had a really good life.

01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:00.049
(MOUTHING) Her dog died.

01:17:00.083 --> 01:17:02.952
Ellie, uh, listen, I've got,
something I need to tell you.

01:17:02.986 --> 01:17:05.088
Okay, now don't get mad.

01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:08.624
I showed your videos
to my dealer, Delia,

01:17:08.658 --> 01:17:10.226
and she'd really like you
to come in

01:17:10.259 --> 01:17:12.595
and talk about your work. Yes?

01:17:12.628 --> 01:17:15.264
Wait, I have to think a minute,
just give me a minute...

01:17:15.298 --> 01:17:17.433
Yes, I think,
she could do it soon.

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:20.236
Yes, hang on one minute.

01:17:20.904 --> 01:17:22.505
Mickey.

01:17:22.538 --> 01:17:26.042
Hi Ellie, it's Delia.
How are you?

01:17:26.075 --> 01:17:28.812
I have not seen you in ages!

01:17:28.845 --> 01:17:32.448
Anyway, so, don't be mad,

01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:34.050
but, uh...

01:17:34.083 --> 01:17:37.253
But Mickey showed me the work,
and I'm really intrigued.

01:17:37.286 --> 01:17:39.455
And I would love for you
to come by and

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:41.324
have a meet-up at the gallery.

01:17:41.357 --> 01:17:43.292
Sometime this week cause
I'm gone next week.

01:17:43.326 --> 01:17:45.161
How is tomorrow, say...

01:17:45.795 --> 01:17:47.496
12:00? 12:30?

01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:51.634
Uh, no, I'm sorry,
12:30 can't work for me.

01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:53.202
Okay, 4:00? How's 4:00?

01:17:53.737 --> 01:17:54.838
DELIA: 4:00?

01:17:54.871 --> 01:17:56.973
Four o'clock?
Okay, four o'clock.

01:17:57.006 --> 01:17:59.542
Okay, good?
All right, I'll see you then?

01:17:59.575 --> 01:18:01.110
Yes, tomorrow at four,
I'll be there.

01:18:01.144 --> 01:18:03.046
Great, all right,
very excited!

01:18:04.047 --> 01:18:05.949
Yes, thank you. Whoo!
(EXCLAIMING IN RELIEF)

01:20:02.932 --> 01:20:05.368
Thanks for coming,
it's good, you wore your hat.

01:20:05.401 --> 01:20:07.736
I didn't think
you'd recognize me without it.

01:20:07.770 --> 01:20:08.972
Nice move.

01:20:09.438 --> 01:20:10.773
You look good.

01:20:10.806 --> 01:20:12.475
You know, A little paint,
a little powder,

01:20:12.508 --> 01:20:14.577
but I really tried hard,
so thank you.

01:20:16.679 --> 01:20:19.382
Look how big
your head is up there.

01:20:19.415 --> 01:20:21.417
It's a lot bigger
in real life.

01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:26.389
You know,
I am surprised you came.

01:20:26.422 --> 01:20:28.624
I wouldn't have missed it
for anything.

01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:30.393
And they love it!

01:20:30.426 --> 01:20:32.561
Seems like a big hit,
everybody's enjoying themselves.

01:20:32.595 --> 01:20:34.563
My friends and my students,

01:20:34.597 --> 01:20:37.333
and it's free wine,
and free beer and...

01:20:37.366 --> 01:20:39.168
People are talking about
the work a little bit,

01:20:39.202 --> 01:20:40.836
so that's kind of
a good sign.

01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:42.838
Good.

01:20:42.872 --> 01:20:45.274
But people think,
you're great in the videos,

01:20:45.308 --> 01:20:47.443
and I'd love to
send you a copy...

01:20:47.476 --> 01:20:49.578
I'd love to have a copy.

01:20:49.612 --> 01:20:51.614
Thinking about,
getting back into acting.

01:20:52.081 --> 01:20:53.249
That's so great!

01:20:53.282 --> 01:20:57.453
I'm a little scared,
but that's probably a good sign.

01:20:58.854 --> 01:21:02.125
I'm sorry,
about how things went down.

01:21:02.158 --> 01:21:03.826
I should've given you a call.

01:21:03.859 --> 01:21:05.895
You left a note,
that was considerate.

01:21:05.929 --> 01:21:07.796
You're too nice.

01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:09.832
I'm a really nice guy.

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:12.135
You know, a couple of us
are gonna go down the block for dinner.

01:21:12.168 --> 01:21:15.071
Nothing fancy,
but if you wanna come,

01:21:15.104 --> 01:21:16.872
that would be awesome.

01:21:16.906 --> 01:21:18.141
I mean just...

01:21:18.174 --> 01:21:19.475
Excuse me, sweetie.

01:21:19.508 --> 01:21:20.676
Can I borrow her?

01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:21.911
Sure.
Thank you.

01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:28.284
What is this?

01:21:28.317 --> 01:21:29.752
This is in tomorrow's paper,
sweetie!

01:21:29.785 --> 01:21:31.320
It's fabulous.

01:21:31.654 --> 01:21:32.888
Thanks.

01:21:34.757 --> 01:21:36.559
Oh, great show.
Oh, thanks!
