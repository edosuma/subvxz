WEBVTT

00:05.149 --> 00:08.269
- You sure this is the right place?
- It's just as I saw it in my premonition.

00:08.589 --> 00:10.568
Yeah, but you kind of
forced that premonition.

00:10.669 --> 00:13.129
Darryl, will you hurry up?
I got a date.

00:13.229 --> 00:14.529
Where's he gonna be?

00:14.629 --> 00:15.889
At a restaurant downtown.

00:15.989 --> 00:17.889
No, I meant where is
the killer going to be?

00:17.989 --> 00:20.429
Oh, he's gonna be robbing
a pawnshop in the alley.

00:20.749 --> 00:23.249
So exactly how do
we know that he's possessed?

00:23.349 --> 00:26.509
When the phantasm comes
out of him and tries to annihilate us.

00:26.829 --> 00:30.709
Wait, so the perp is not responsible
for the other killings, it's this,

00:31.029 --> 00:33.529
- whatever you call it?
- No, he is.

00:33.629 --> 00:36.449
The phantasm only
possesses bad guys

00:36.549 --> 00:37.889
to make them worse.

00:37.989 --> 00:39.989
Okay, shall we?

00:40.709 --> 00:42.729
She really wants this demon,
doesn't she?

00:42.829 --> 00:46.189
No, she really wants her date.

00:54.989 --> 00:56.129
Okay, go, go.

00:56.229 --> 00:58.169
Okay, well, just make sure
you do your thing

00:58.269 --> 01:00.169
before any annihilating occurs,
okay?

01:00.269 --> 01:01.729
Have we ever let you down?

01:01.829 --> 01:03.829
Go.

01:04.989 --> 01:06.989
Freeze. Police.

01:08.789 --> 01:10.789
Wait, not yet.

01:17.229 --> 01:19.309
Throw the potion.

01:28.669 --> 01:30.289
Mother of God.

01:30.389 --> 01:32.389
Now, now.

01:42.949 --> 01:45.129
- Do you want it?
- No.

01:45.229 --> 01:46.409
You guys saved my life.

01:46.509 --> 01:49.169
That's okay, we put you
at risk, again.

01:49.269 --> 01:52.209
You caught a killer, you saved an
innocent, not bad for a night's work.

01:52.309 --> 01:54.529
I gotta go. Tell Sheila
I said hi, okay?

01:54.629 --> 01:57.129
Yeah. I'll call it in.

01:57.229 --> 01:59.229
You guys better get on
out of here before...

02:00.709 --> 02:02.709
...somebody sees you.

02:07.629 --> 02:09.649
Hey, was that car there before?

02:09.749 --> 02:13.509
Jeez, Paige, relax. You act like
we've never done this before.

02:28.909 --> 02:30.909
Gotcha.

03:31.269 --> 03:33.289
Morning, how was your date?

03:33.389 --> 03:35.949
Good, other than the fact that
he's not the man of my dreams.

03:36.269 --> 03:39.009
- You can tell after one date?
- No, I could tell that because

03:39.109 --> 03:41.129
I see nothing in the future for us
besides sex.

03:41.229 --> 03:42.969
- And I'm not interested in that.
- Sex?

03:43.069 --> 03:45.769
No, wasting my time. Either you're
the father of the child

03:45.869 --> 03:48.009
that I saw in my vision or not.
So I'm moving on.

03:48.109 --> 03:50.169
Can you pass me
the asphodel root, please?

03:50.269 --> 03:52.269
Yeah, what are you,
demon hunting?

03:53.189 --> 03:55.649
No, lunch date. I wanna
make sure I get a hit off

03:55.749 --> 03:57.289
of him before the entrÐ¹es come.

03:57.389 --> 03:59.389
No sense wasting
those calories, right?

03:59.709 --> 04:02.789
Wait a second, so now you're trying to
force premonitions on your dates?

04:03.269 --> 04:05.529
It's the quickest way
to find out who I'm looking for.

04:05.629 --> 04:07.849
Does it even matter to you that you're
breaking every

04:07.949 --> 04:09.650
Wiccan rule that exists?

04:09.750 --> 04:12.070
I think after all these years,
I know what I'm doing.

04:12.390 --> 04:14.130
Besides with Piper in Magic School,

04:14.230 --> 04:16.529
we're down a power.
We could use the extra boost.

04:16.630 --> 04:18.829
Maybe, I just hope we don't misuse it.

04:20.390 --> 04:23.750
<i>- There's the Book, do you mind?</i>
<i>- No, knock yourself out.</i>

04:24.070 --> 04:25.890
I've been working some
demonic connections.

04:25.990 --> 04:28.370
I have a theory on who's
trying to turn Wyatt evil.

04:28.470 --> 04:31.590
Oh, a new theory. What's
that, like, the third one this week?

04:31.950 --> 04:34.830
- Are you keeping score now?
- She's grumpy. She hasn't had coffee.

04:35.150 --> 04:37.150
I am not grumpy.

04:37.510 --> 04:38.810
Okay, fine. Maybe a little bit,

04:38.910 --> 04:42.030
but you have to admit you've had
a lot of different theories lately,

04:42.350 --> 04:43.850
and none of them have panned out.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.270
That's why they call them theories.

04:46.590 --> 04:48.590
Do we even get along in the future?

04:49.270 --> 04:51.210
How's Piper?
Have you seen her?

04:51.310 --> 04:54.710
She's good, big. You know, I keep
thinking how weird it's gonna be

04:55.030 --> 04:57.010
to actually see myself being born.

04:57.110 --> 05:00.210
- And how's Leo?
- Leo? Don't know, haven't seen him.

05:00.310 --> 05:02.430
That's because you're
avoiding him still, aren't you?

05:03.030 --> 05:06.210
Chris, he's your father, you have to
talk to him. How are you gonna change

05:06.310 --> 05:07.690
the future if you don't?

05:07.790 --> 05:09.910
That's not the future I came
back to change. Thanks.

05:13.350 --> 05:15.350
Hey, don't look at me, I'm grumpy.

05:21.550 --> 05:24.950
Sheila, what's the matter? Come in,
come in, come in, come in.

05:25.990 --> 05:27.690
What's going on?

05:27.790 --> 05:30.310
- It's Darryl.
- What about Darryl? Is he okay?

05:30.630 --> 05:32.630
They just arrested him...

05:33.070 --> 05:35.070
...for murder.

05:40.390 --> 05:42.390
I don't really know what happened.

05:42.990 --> 05:46.090
- It's all kind of a blur.
- What are you talking about?

05:46.190 --> 05:49.310
It was self-defence, he
shot first, several times.

05:50.190 --> 05:52.370
- He did?
- You don't remember any of that?

05:52.470 --> 05:54.210
Did you get hit on
the head or something?

05:54.310 --> 05:57.310
- Maybe when you pushed him down.
- No, he was fine after that.

05:57.670 --> 05:59.910
Something weird is going on here.

06:00.990 --> 06:02.990
Lieutenant Morris,

06:03.430 --> 06:06.190
I'm sorry, but we really have to
prepare for your arraignment.

06:06.510 --> 06:08.730
It's okay, they're my friends.

06:08.830 --> 06:11.150
Yeah, there's a problem here
because this man is innocent.

06:11.470 --> 06:14.070
- Yeah? How do you know?
- Because I was there...

06:15.510 --> 06:18.250
...driving around in the area.
- Perjuring yourself isn't gonna

06:18.350 --> 06:19.770
help any, lady.

06:19.870 --> 06:22.230
The prosecution's evidence
is overwhelming. Trust me.

06:22.550 --> 06:24.690
Evidence, what evidence?

06:24.790 --> 06:26.790
It's okay. Show them.

06:36.510 --> 06:40.030
Please. Please,
don't kill me. No. Don't kill me.

06:45.230 --> 06:47.230
That's not what happened.

06:53.670 --> 06:55.490
Inspector Sheridan?

06:55.590 --> 06:57.590
- Yes.
- We would like to talk to you.

06:58.550 --> 07:00.730
- Easy.
- Do you have a personal grudge

07:00.830 --> 07:02.970
- against Darryl Morris?
- Morris?

07:03.070 --> 07:05.750
Yeah, we know you faked
the images on the tape.

07:06.070 --> 07:09.550
And we're here to let you know that we
won't watch you frame our friend.

07:09.870 --> 07:13.190
- She's a little upset.
- Yes, I can see that.

07:13.510 --> 07:16.310
- And you are?
- Phoebe. Phoebe Halliwell.

07:17.150 --> 07:18.850
Halliwell.

07:18.950 --> 07:21.150
Your name certainly pops up
in his file plenty.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.850
For the record, I didn't fake anything

07:24.950 --> 07:26.930
because I was there undercover.

07:27.030 --> 07:29.910
And I saw it go down with my own
eyes. I've been investigating Morris

07:30.230 --> 07:33.330
for a few weeks now trying to figure
out why so many of his suspects

07:33.430 --> 07:36.170
over the last five years just vanish

07:36.270 --> 07:38.370
or mysteriously wind up dead.

07:38.470 --> 07:40.010
Now I know.

07:40.110 --> 07:42.090
He takes the law into his own hands.

07:42.190 --> 07:44.190
Excuse me.

07:47.270 --> 07:49.850
- Well?
- If she was lying, I couldn't sense it.

07:49.950 --> 07:52.550
Then how do you
explain what happened?

08:01.390 --> 08:04.370
- Sure hope this works.
- It will.

08:04.470 --> 08:06.470
- Coffee cart.
- Cart away.

08:11.190 --> 08:14.950
<i>Flowers that bring desire</i>
<i>Make them turn into fire</i>

08:26.431 --> 08:29.711
- I see you got our message.
- What do you think you're doing now?

08:30.071 --> 08:33.231
Well, we didn't know how else to
call for you. Figured you weren't listed

08:33.551 --> 08:35.751
- in the Yellow Pages.
- What do you want?

08:36.071 --> 08:39.010
We wanna know why
you framed Darryl Morris.

08:39.111 --> 08:40.650
That was your doing, wasn't it?

08:40.751 --> 08:44.351
Magic was exposed, we were
forced to clean it up.

08:44.671 --> 08:47.191
- Change what was.
- To protect you.

08:47.511 --> 08:50.951
I thought we resolved this the last
time you guys tried to intervene.

08:51.271 --> 08:53.531
We clean up
our own magical messes.

08:53.631 --> 08:55.811
But you didn't even know
about this one.

08:55.911 --> 08:58.871
You didn't realize you
were being followed, taped.

08:59.231 --> 09:01.711
Yeah, but we always manage
to fix these things somehow.

09:02.031 --> 09:04.031
No, you wouldn't have.

09:04.791 --> 09:07.911
That's why we were put on
the case to begin with, it was

09:08.231 --> 09:10.871
- anticipated.
- You know what, I don't care.

09:11.191 --> 09:14.751
If you don't free Darryl Morris, we're
just gonna keep exposing magic and...

09:16.471 --> 09:19.831
This will not be like our
last encounter, Miss Halliwell.

09:21.471 --> 09:23.991
We're under strict orders not to
negotiate with you this time.

09:25.471 --> 09:27.991
Strict orders from whom?

09:29.431 --> 09:32.691
The Tribunal. It's a council
made up of Elders and demons

09:32.791 --> 09:36.591
to monitor magic, to make sure nobody
ever finds out about its use.

09:36.951 --> 09:39.451
At whatever the cost.

09:39.551 --> 09:41.491
Which is why they
created the Cleaners,

09:41.591 --> 09:44.391
and gave them the power
to erase events, memories.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.531
Or in this case, to change them.

09:46.631 --> 09:49.111
Well, it's just part of the
grand design to allow magic to

09:49.431 --> 09:51.291
influence but not take over

09:51.391 --> 09:53.171
- free will.
- It's the thing both sides

09:53.271 --> 09:54.771
could agree upon.

09:54.871 --> 09:57.011
Okay,
so how do we find this Tribunal?

09:57.111 --> 09:59.751
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

10:01.311 --> 10:03.871
- What's wrong?
- It's Darryl.

10:04.791 --> 10:06.491
Our friendly Cleaners
have struck again.

10:06.591 --> 10:08.791
He's in jail for murder.

10:09.111 --> 10:10.571
What, why, what happened?

10:10.671 --> 10:12.371
Someone was in a hurry.

10:12.471 --> 10:14.211
Oh, wait, are we blaming
me for this?

10:14.311 --> 10:16.611
Did we or did we not
catch the demon?

10:16.711 --> 10:19.351
Yeah, but you forced the premonition,
so maybe we could have been

10:19.671 --> 10:22.131
more careful, and maybe we
could have seen that somebody

10:22.231 --> 10:24.771
- was watching.
- We'd have never caught the killer.

10:24.871 --> 10:26.731
All right, guys, this isn't helping.

10:26.831 --> 10:29.191
I know, it isn't.

10:29.511 --> 10:31.511
There's only one thing that will.

10:37.471 --> 10:39.091
Where are we?

10:39.191 --> 10:41.011
Nowhere.

10:41.111 --> 10:42.331
Anywhere.

10:42.431 --> 10:44.511
You don't want to know.

10:45.471 --> 10:47.611
You should know that
the Tribunal is not

10:47.711 --> 10:49.691
like anything
you've ever faced before.

10:49.791 --> 10:52.351
They are not a power
to be trifled with.

10:52.671 --> 10:54.711
- We understand.
- Do you?

10:55.031 --> 10:57.411
You might not like what's been
happening to your friend.

10:57.511 --> 11:00.431
But be aware before you embark
upon this journey that where it ends

11:00.751 --> 11:02.751
might just be worse.

11:05.471 --> 11:07.471
Call them.

11:37.271 --> 11:40.491
What reason have you to
call the Tribunal?

11:40.591 --> 11:45.031
To challenge the actions
of the Cleaners on behalf...

11:47.111 --> 11:49.871
...of the Charmed Ones.
- The Charmed Ones?

11:50.351 --> 11:52.331
But there are only two.

11:52.431 --> 11:54.171
The other is with child.

11:54.271 --> 11:57.111
I assume the sisters will speak
for her in absentia.

11:57.431 --> 11:59.851
Yeah, in absentia,

11:59.951 --> 12:01.951
Your Greatness?

12:03.871 --> 12:06.091
There's four of them,
how do they break a tie?

12:06.191 --> 12:08.171
You don't wanna know.

12:08.271 --> 12:10.911
Your request has been granted.

12:21.271 --> 12:23.171
Barbas.

12:23.271 --> 12:25.752
- What the hell is he doing here?
- You missed me.

12:26.072 --> 12:27.372
Didn't we vanquish you?

12:27.472 --> 12:29.412
To the fires of hell.

12:29.512 --> 12:32.272
I've been granted a temporary
leave of absence

12:32.592 --> 12:35.032
in order to act as
your opposing counsel.

12:35.392 --> 12:37.132
We liked his pitch.

12:37.232 --> 12:38.652
Pitch?

12:38.752 --> 12:40.332
What pitch?

12:40.432 --> 12:41.812
How did he even know about it?

12:41.912 --> 12:44.672
We have the right
to choose anybody we wish.

12:45.472 --> 12:48.352
- Gideon.
- Your Honours, in the interests of fair...

12:48.672 --> 12:51.212
On that fairness issue,
I submit that in order

12:51.312 --> 12:54.672
to expedite matters and to keep
the Charmed Ones honest...

12:54.992 --> 12:56.992
Us honest?

12:58.352 --> 12:59.972
For their own good,

13:00.072 --> 13:02.972
we graphically remind them
as to what

13:03.072 --> 13:05.392
exactly is at stake here
so they do not

13:05.712 --> 13:08.752
foolishly try some trickery

13:09.072 --> 13:12.132
in order to slip away
like they did the last time

13:12.232 --> 13:14.592
they faced the Cleaners.

13:15.592 --> 13:17.412
It is done.

13:17.512 --> 13:20.392
- What is done?
- I'm not sure.

13:26.952 --> 13:28.952
Darryl.

13:32.912 --> 13:34.972
<i>The governor denied the stay.</i>

13:35.072 --> 13:36.612
What stay?
What's going on?

13:36.712 --> 13:38.452
We have accelerated time,

13:38.552 --> 13:40.672
but only for the execution.

13:40.992 --> 13:42.412
Execution?

13:42.512 --> 13:45.072
You have until midnight
to convince us

13:45.392 --> 13:49.472
- or his sentence will be carried out.
- Magic will be protected,

13:49.872 --> 13:51.872
one way or the other.

13:57.552 --> 14:00.392
We didn't know that signing up
for this would put Darryl on death row.

14:00.712 --> 14:02.932
I warned you about
invoking the Tribunal.

14:03.032 --> 14:04.532
Yeah, well, you didn't warn us that

14:04.632 --> 14:06.952
they would call upon
our worst enemy.

14:07.752 --> 14:09.612
Gideon, your case.

14:09.712 --> 14:12.132
Yes, Your Honour, just a few
more moments, if you please.

14:12.232 --> 14:13.892
We don't.

14:13.992 --> 14:16.492
You're the ones
who called for us, proceed.

14:16.592 --> 14:19.532
We called for justice,
not the Demon of Fear.

14:19.632 --> 14:22.112
I don't see the problem
with me being here.

14:23.352 --> 14:25.792
There's a conflict of interest,
and we believe

14:26.112 --> 14:28.012
that the Tribunal
should recognize this.

14:28.112 --> 14:29.972
- I think this is a setup.
- Phoebe.

14:30.072 --> 14:32.752
How dare you question our integrity.

14:33.072 --> 14:36.192
Not yours, theirs.

14:36.552 --> 14:39.152
Barbas has tried to kill us
three times in the past.

14:42.232 --> 14:44.292
<i>Mrs. Joffee?</i>

14:44.392 --> 14:46.712
<i>It's SWA Properties.</i>

14:47.752 --> 14:49.972
<i>Hello, dear.</i>

14:50.072 --> 14:52.192
<i>Thanks so much for coming out.</i>

14:58.992 --> 15:02.492
<i>I know how you kill, but there</i>
<i>are no elevators around here.</i>

15:02.592 --> 15:05.752
<i>Elevators? That's what you think</i>
<i>your greatest fear is?</i>

15:06.072 --> 15:10.992
<i>You mortals need to look deeper.</i>
<i>Down where the real truth lies.</i>

15:11.432 --> 15:16.112
<i>Your greatest fear is losing a sister,</i>
<i>and I get two for one.</i>

15:17.632 --> 15:19.772
The good old days.

15:19.872 --> 15:22.412
- What was that?
- The Circle of Truth. It's enchanted.

15:22.512 --> 15:25.952
It reads thoughts and shows them.
You must be careful.

15:26.272 --> 15:27.932
Maybe you'd better just sit down.

15:28.032 --> 15:29.532
If I may?

15:29.632 --> 15:32.632
It is not my past evils
that's in question here.

15:32.952 --> 15:36.432
What is in question here
is these three witches'

15:36.792 --> 15:40.152
so called right
to be continually cleaning up

15:40.472 --> 15:43.832
- after their own magical asses.
- We have to get out of here.

15:44.152 --> 15:46.172
- We have to figure this out.
- You can't.

15:46.272 --> 15:47.892
If you leave, Lieutenant Morris dies.

15:47.992 --> 15:50.012
Does it really matter
if we were set up?

15:50.112 --> 15:51.492
The point is, we were exposed.

15:51.592 --> 15:54.012
But if we can prove he orchestrated
the exposure, it might.

15:54.112 --> 15:56.192
Go find out what you can, hurry.

15:58.592 --> 16:00.252
Was I boring him?

16:00.352 --> 16:03.712
With all due respect,
if it truly is our case

16:04.032 --> 16:06.032
to present, may I?

16:08.552 --> 16:12.032
To better put this particular situation
into its proper context,

16:12.352 --> 16:15.632
it bears reminding Your Honours
of the long history,

16:15.992 --> 16:19.052
the long successful history,
the Charmed Ones have of

16:19.152 --> 16:21.752
shielding their magical tracks.

16:22.712 --> 16:24.772
If I may show you some examples.

16:24.872 --> 16:27.212
- I'm going.
- No, you can't.

16:27.312 --> 16:29.372
Well, I can't just let
them hang either, Leo.

16:29.472 --> 16:31.772
If it wasn't safe for you before,
it's even less so now

16:31.872 --> 16:34.453
- with Barbas there. Please.
- Well, what about Darryl?

16:34.553 --> 16:37.193
- Does he know what's happening?
- No, I'm not gonna tell him.

16:37.553 --> 16:39.733
I need to concentrate
on proving Barbas' set up.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.013
How are you gonna do that?

16:41.113 --> 16:44.233
I was hoping that you would call
Chris to use his demonic connections.

16:44.553 --> 16:46.493
Why don't you ask him?

16:46.593 --> 16:48.493
Right.

16:48.593 --> 16:50.593
Chris?

16:50.993 --> 16:52.993
Yeah, Mom, what do you...

16:53.433 --> 16:54.933
...need?

16:55.033 --> 16:57.913
We need your help.

16:59.353 --> 17:00.933
The point being,

17:01.033 --> 17:02.773
the Charmed Ones

17:02.873 --> 17:05.292
have never once failed

17:05.393 --> 17:07.413
in their duty to keep

17:07.512 --> 17:09.893
the big secret.

17:09.992 --> 17:11.992
Witness.

17:12.873 --> 17:16.153
<i>I made an appointment with you</i>
<i>at Missing Persons today.</i>

17:16.473 --> 17:19.233
<i>Wait, you want Phoebe</i>
<i>to report Cole as missing?</i>

17:19.553 --> 17:21.573
<i>She has to,</i>
<i>otherwise somebody else will,</i>

17:21.673 --> 17:24.252
<i>and she'll become the prime suspect</i>
<i>in his disappearance.</i>

17:24.353 --> 17:27.093
<i>So you want me to pack up his stuff</i>
<i>so it looks like he left me.</i>

17:27.193 --> 17:28.292
<i>That's right.</i>

17:28.393 --> 17:32.193
<i>We cannot give the police</i>
<i>any reason to suspect foul play.</i>

17:32.513 --> 17:35.293
<i>I mean, technically,</i>
<i>you three did kill him.</i>

17:35.393 --> 17:37.733
<i>Let the object of objection</i>
<i>Become but a dream</i>

17:37.833 --> 17:39.953
<i>As I cause the seen to be unseen</i>

17:45.193 --> 17:46.973
As you've just seen,

17:47.073 --> 17:50.153
Lieutenant Morris whom
the Cleaners would have die

17:50.473 --> 17:52.773
to cover magic is here

17:52.873 --> 17:55.753
instrumental in keeping it protected.

17:56.073 --> 18:00.033
Would you play that hologram
just a tiny bit longer?

18:01.793 --> 18:03.573
Humour me.

18:03.673 --> 18:05.673
Do it.

18:11.073 --> 18:14.353
<i>I just wish I could make the rest</i>
<i>of your pain go away that easily.</i>

18:15.473 --> 18:17.133
<i>So do I.</i>

18:17.233 --> 18:19.793
<i>You murdering witch!</i>

18:21.553 --> 18:23.813
That's not fair, I was
under the influence of evil.

18:23.913 --> 18:25.373
Yes, you were.

18:25.473 --> 18:28.113
But then it seems like
you girls are so often

18:28.433 --> 18:31.173
under the influence of one thing

18:31.273 --> 18:33.013
or another.

18:33.113 --> 18:36.593
<i>Your husband fits</i>
<i>the classic profile of a deadbeat dad.</i>

18:37.433 --> 18:39.793
<i>- Make it go out.</i>
<i>- I can't make it go out!</i>

18:45.553 --> 18:47.993
<i>Phoebe? I mean, fire!</i>

18:50.353 --> 18:52.713
Wait, you're gonna love this one.

18:54.433 --> 18:56.813
<i>So glad you're home.</i>
<i>We have some new floral sketches</i>

18:56.913 --> 18:59.693
<i>- we'd like you to see.</i>
<i>- Now's not really a good time.</i>

18:59.793 --> 19:02.253
<i>They're welcome to come in, Leo.</i>

19:02.353 --> 19:05.993
<i>I've revisited the dinner menu, Piper,</i>
<i>and you are going to be thrilled.</i>

19:06.313 --> 19:08.373
<i>I have some dynamic choices</i>
<i>that l...</i>

19:08.473 --> 19:10.473
<i>I want pigs in blankets.</i>

19:17.553 --> 19:19.853
<i>It's nice to see a bride</i>
<i>who still has a sense of humour</i>

19:19.953 --> 19:21.733
<i>this close to the big day.</i>

19:21.833 --> 19:26.753
<i>No, I want pigs in blankets.</i>

19:35.633 --> 19:38.913
I frankly don't see the relevance of
any of this. It's wholly beside the point.

19:39.233 --> 19:40.333
No, no, no,

19:40.433 --> 19:43.633
that is precisely the point.

19:44.233 --> 19:47.193
The Charmed Ones
are so influenced

19:47.513 --> 19:49.893
by outside forces,

19:49.993 --> 19:53.193
how can we ever expect
to continue to trust them

19:53.513 --> 19:56.553
- to clean up after themselves?
- We cleaned up after each

19:56.873 --> 19:58.533
and every one of those situations.

19:58.633 --> 20:01.393
But how close you came to not.

20:03.593 --> 20:05.593
Continue, Gideon.

20:07.233 --> 20:09.233
Where is Leo?

20:13.993 --> 20:16.733
Barbas escaped the fires
of hell and so did you.

20:16.833 --> 20:18.533
I know he helped you.

20:18.633 --> 20:20.653
Please, I don't wanna go back
down there.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.933
- Don't throw me back down there.
- Chris, I don't

20:23.033 --> 20:25.433
- think this is the best way.
- Last chance, Phinks.

20:26.113 --> 20:27.253
Okay, okay.

20:27.353 --> 20:29.293
Phantasms, we used phantasms.

20:29.393 --> 20:32.013
- How?
- Barbas buddied up to a couple

20:32.113 --> 20:34.933
of them down there. He used them
to do stuff for him, you know,

20:35.033 --> 20:37.373
- since they go back and forth.
- What kind of stuff?

20:37.473 --> 20:40.934
I don't know. I swear I don't know.

20:41.034 --> 20:43.954
But whatever it was, he said that it
could resurrect him somehow.

20:44.314 --> 20:47.134
It could give him new life
permanently too.

20:47.234 --> 20:49.514
He said if he won something.

20:49.834 --> 20:51.214
The case.

20:51.314 --> 20:52.694
He must've used a phantasm

20:52.794 --> 20:55.354
to cut a deal with the demon members
of the Tribunal.

20:55.914 --> 20:58.054
- We need proof.
- What do you think he is?

20:58.154 --> 21:00.734
- A demon, they'll discredit him.
- It's better than nothing.

21:00.834 --> 21:03.174
- It's a waste of time.
- It's the best we've got.

21:03.274 --> 21:05.754
- Then we need to do better.
- Look...

21:08.754 --> 21:10.934
Shoot.

21:11.034 --> 21:13.034
Now look what
you made me do.

21:15.394 --> 21:17.394
<i>Piper, what did you do</i>
<i>with the house?</i>

21:17.994 --> 21:19.494
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

21:19.594 --> 21:21.734
<i>- What have I done?</i>
<i>- The spell, Piper,</i>

21:21.834 --> 21:24.314
<i>- you need to reverse it, fast.</i>
<i>- I'm not sure I can.</i>

21:24.634 --> 21:27.914
<i>Then make us disappear because</i>
<i>this one will be tough to explain.</i>

21:28.274 --> 21:30.134
<i>You can do it, Piper, come on.</i>

21:30.234 --> 21:33.454
<i>Let the object of objection return</i>

21:33.554 --> 21:37.394
<i>So that its existence</i>
<i>May be reaffirmed</i>

21:44.314 --> 21:46.174
<i>Nicely done.</i>

21:46.274 --> 21:49.214
So then despite what Barbas

21:49.314 --> 21:50.814
would have you believe,

21:50.914 --> 21:53.514
regardless of outside influences,

21:53.834 --> 21:57.154
the sisters have always
managed to protect magic.

21:57.474 --> 22:00.334
And therefore based upon
all the evidence,

22:00.434 --> 22:03.194
we ask the Tribunal...
No, we demand

22:03.514 --> 22:06.294
that the Cleaners be forced
to reverse what they have done,

22:06.394 --> 22:08.494
that Lieutenant Morris be freed,

22:08.594 --> 22:10.374
and that the
Charmed Ones be allowed

22:10.474 --> 22:12.534
to do what they have
always done so well,

22:12.634 --> 22:16.274
cover their own tracks, respectfully.

22:19.394 --> 22:22.594
Bravo. Bravo. Really very

22:22.914 --> 22:24.414
compelling stuff, counsel.

22:24.514 --> 22:25.934
In fact I think

22:26.034 --> 22:29.354
that you have just successfully
argued my case for me.

22:29.714 --> 22:31.334
Now what's he up to?

22:31.434 --> 22:33.814
Now, obviously,

22:33.914 --> 22:35.974
this whole
thing has now become

22:36.074 --> 22:39.834
much, much bigger than the simple
case of whether the good lieutenant

22:40.194 --> 22:42.374
bites the dust because,

22:42.474 --> 22:44.054
as we have just seen,

22:44.154 --> 22:46.494
the recklessness displayed

22:46.594 --> 22:49.294
by these three witches

22:49.394 --> 22:52.534
has now become
of epidemic proportions.

22:52.634 --> 22:55.294
Objection. May I remind my
counterpart that this is simply a

22:55.394 --> 22:58.454
question of whether or not the situation
should be reversed. It is not

22:58.554 --> 23:00.914
an indictment
on the Charmed Ones.

23:01.234 --> 23:03.134
Maybe it should be.

23:03.234 --> 23:04.974
This is what he's up to.

23:05.074 --> 23:07.114
VoilÐ°.

23:07.634 --> 23:09.994
<i>They don't have to move.</i>
<i>They can stay for a year.</i>

23:10.314 --> 23:11.974
<i>Ten years.</i>

23:12.074 --> 23:15.274
<i>What about the cockroaches? Are you</i>
<i>gonna do something about them?</i>

23:15.594 --> 23:18.754
<i>First thing tomorrow.</i>
<i>Just please, don't drop me. Please!</i>

23:19.074 --> 23:20.254
<i>Phoebe?</i>

23:20.354 --> 23:23.414
<i>Cole? What are you doing here?</i>

23:23.514 --> 23:25.814
<i>Well, I got a call</i>
<i>from one of the tenants</i>

23:25.914 --> 23:30.194
<i>saying that Wonder Woman</i>
<i>was terrorizing the landlord.</i>

23:30.594 --> 23:32.454
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>

23:32.554 --> 23:36.274
<i>Well, I'm teaching my buddy here how</i>
<i>important it is to be a better person.</i>

23:36.634 --> 23:39.374
<i>I don't know what's going on here,</i>
<i>but this is not you, literally.</i>

23:39.474 --> 23:42.874
<i>Are you kidding? This is better than</i>
<i>me. This is new-and-improved me.</i>

23:43.194 --> 23:46.554
<i>Now not only can I help my readers,</i>
<i>but I can help the entire city.</i>

23:46.874 --> 23:50.234
<i>- Careful, he's got ears.</i>
<i>- Oh, please, relax.</i>

23:50.554 --> 23:53.754
<i>The only thing he can hear right now</i>
<i>is his blood rushing to his brain.</i>

23:56.994 --> 23:58.254
<i>Okay, Cole, I gotta go.</i>

23:58.354 --> 24:01.094
<i>Because I have a lot</i>
<i>of loyal readers that need my help.</i>

24:01.194 --> 24:03.354
<i>- Okay?</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

24:06.994 --> 24:10.594
And last but by no means least,

24:10.954 --> 24:13.034
where were the Charmed Ones

24:13.354 --> 24:16.314
to clean up this mess?

24:16.634 --> 24:21.234
<i>All your valuables, all your money!</i>
<i>Hurry up! Watches, wallets...</i>

24:25.234 --> 24:28.274
<i>Come on, nothing's changed.</i>
<i>Give me the money! Hurry up!</i>

25:05.355 --> 25:08.095
That is absurd. That was Cole,
we weren't responsible for that.

25:08.195 --> 25:10.935
- We weren't even there.
- But you were there, Phoebe.

25:11.035 --> 25:13.855
It was your cold rejection of his love

25:13.955 --> 25:15.935
that drove him
to that reckless despair.

25:16.035 --> 25:17.855
So I say

25:17.955 --> 25:19.655
that you are responsible.

25:19.755 --> 25:22.375
Hexes, possession,

25:22.475 --> 25:25.795
evil influences, affairs

25:26.115 --> 25:27.935
of the heart.

25:28.035 --> 25:31.515
I say we're lucky that all
the magic has not been exposed

25:31.875 --> 25:35.435
beyond repair long before now.
If we want to protect

25:35.795 --> 25:38.635
all that we are,

25:38.955 --> 25:41.795
all that this Tribunal stands for,

25:42.115 --> 25:45.555
then I say we should
not be just deciding

25:45.875 --> 25:48.255
the fate
of some, poor pathetic mortal.

25:48.355 --> 25:52.395
No, we should be deciding the fate
of these three

25:53.235 --> 25:55.275
and whether they should
ever be permitted

25:55.595 --> 25:58.475
to practice magic again.

26:07.435 --> 26:09.435
So be it.

26:15.915 --> 26:18.895
Okay, I get the fact that
Barbas used the phantasm

26:18.995 --> 26:20.735
to cut a deal
so he could try the case,

26:20.835 --> 26:23.095
but that still doesn't explain
how he set up the girls.

26:23.195 --> 26:26.095
To get her to possess the killer
so the sisters would get on to him.

26:26.195 --> 26:29.435
But that's only part of it. All right,
how did he even know Darryl was

26:29.755 --> 26:32.775
- under investigation in the first place?
- There is nothing in here

26:32.875 --> 26:35.455
- about phantasms that we don't know.
- Hey.

26:35.555 --> 26:38.675
- Did you listen to a word I just said?
- What?

26:39.035 --> 26:40.935
- Never mind.
- All right, you know what,

26:41.035 --> 26:43.955
this is ridiculous. Okay, it's
obvious you hate my guts, Chris.

26:44.315 --> 26:47.095
I understand. I'm a bad father
in the future, but there's nothing

26:47.195 --> 26:50.175
I can do about that right now. So can
we concentrate on working together

26:50.275 --> 26:52.615
to save Darryl,
to save the girls, please?

26:52.715 --> 26:55.215
- Fine.
- Great. All right, let's start

26:55.315 --> 26:57.315
with what we know, huh?
How about phantasms?

26:57.955 --> 26:59.295
Wait,

26:59.395 --> 27:01.055
that's it.

27:01.155 --> 27:05.115
Phantasms, plural. Phinks said Barbas
buddied up to a couple of them, right?

27:05.515 --> 27:08.155
That means there must be
another one out there for us to find.

27:08.515 --> 27:10.875
Yeah, see? I knew we
could work together.

27:13.915 --> 27:15.215
Yeah.

27:15.315 --> 27:17.055
Are you sure about this?

27:17.155 --> 27:19.095
Yeah, if they're gonna put
us on trial too,

27:19.195 --> 27:21.135
it might be the only
way to save Darryl.

27:21.235 --> 27:22.775
We have to stand on our record.

27:22.875 --> 27:25.655
If all the good we've done in the last
six years isn't good enough,

27:25.755 --> 27:27.535
then nothing is.

27:27.635 --> 27:29.635
Very well.

27:30.115 --> 27:32.395
Your witness.

27:33.195 --> 27:35.255
Well, let's see,

27:35.355 --> 27:37.575
so many holograms,

27:37.675 --> 27:39.335
so little time.

27:39.435 --> 27:41.735
- Barbas.
- Well, l...

27:41.835 --> 27:45.295
I guess I should ask
one of the Cleaners

27:45.395 --> 27:47.515
a few quick questions.

27:47.835 --> 27:49.835
As you wish.

27:50.235 --> 27:52.575
You have been assigned

27:52.675 --> 27:55.895
to watch the Charmed Ones

27:55.995 --> 27:58.655
since they first became witches.
Have you not?

27:58.755 --> 28:00.915
That is correct.

28:01.235 --> 28:04.855
Would Lieutenant Morris
be the first policeman

28:04.955 --> 28:07.915
to die in order
to clean up one of their little

28:08.235 --> 28:10.295
magical messes?

28:10.395 --> 28:12.955
No.

28:14.915 --> 28:17.355
<i>- You okay?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

28:27.755 --> 28:29.535
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

28:29.635 --> 28:31.775
<i>He's dead.</i>

28:31.875 --> 28:34.935
Truly tragic.
That was their sister Prue's

28:35.035 --> 28:37.275
first true love.

28:37.635 --> 28:39.615
Wonder

28:39.715 --> 28:41.835
whatever happened to her.

28:42.155 --> 28:43.935
Don't.

28:44.035 --> 28:46.615
- It's not worth it.
- Anyone else?

28:46.715 --> 28:48.215
Yes.

28:48.315 --> 28:49.895
Inspector Reece.

28:49.995 --> 28:51.995
We had to keep a close watch
on him.

28:59.076 --> 29:01.076
<i>Inspector.</i>

29:01.476 --> 29:02.696
<i>How can I help you?</i>

29:02.796 --> 29:04.856
<i>You can tell me</i>
<i>where to find Cole Turner.</i>

29:04.956 --> 29:07.936
<i>I know he's alive,</i>
<i>and I know he's in town.</i>

29:08.036 --> 29:09.736
<i>- Really?</i>
<i>- Yeah, really.</i>

29:09.836 --> 29:12.576
<i>You wanna know how?</i>
<i>Because his former landlady</i>

29:12.676 --> 29:14.896
<i>was found brutally murdered</i>
<i>at his address.</i>

29:14.996 --> 29:17.676
<i>Oh, my God. That's awful.</i>

29:17.996 --> 29:19.976
<i>Awful like you can't imagine.</i>

29:20.076 --> 29:22.336
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

29:22.436 --> 29:24.756
<i>And I know what this looks like.</i>

29:25.076 --> 29:27.356
<i>And I am... I am so sorry</i>

29:27.676 --> 29:30.916
<i>- for what happened to...</i>
<i>- Sorry? Her eyes were open in terror.</i>

29:31.276 --> 29:34.516
<i>Her skull was punctured in two places,</i>
<i>and by the time the police got there,</i>

29:34.836 --> 29:37.256
<i>most of her brain</i>
<i>had spilled out onto the floor.</i>

29:37.356 --> 29:39.576
<i>Be sick, be horrified.</i>

29:39.676 --> 29:41.996
<i>But don't stand there</i>
<i>lying to me and say you're sorry.</i>

29:42.316 --> 29:45.436
<i>I'm gonna find him, Miss Halliwell,</i>
<i>and then I'm gonna bust his ass,</i>

29:45.756 --> 29:48.756
<i>and then I'm gonna bust yours.</i>

29:49.076 --> 29:52.556
And did he find him?

29:52.876 --> 29:54.576
No.

29:54.676 --> 29:56.676
He did not.

30:03.316 --> 30:05.316
<i>Open the gate.</i>

30:07.436 --> 30:09.736
We're real lucky one of
those demons came along

30:09.836 --> 30:11.836
and tied up that loose
end, aren't we?

30:13.516 --> 30:16.196
It's a rhetorical question.

30:17.916 --> 30:19.336
Never mind.

30:19.436 --> 30:22.276
There was another.

30:22.636 --> 30:25.116
An FBI agent.

30:25.996 --> 30:28.556
That's right.

30:32.916 --> 30:35.876
<i>In case you're wondering,</i>
<i>that's just a copy.</i>

30:37.516 --> 30:40.996
<i>Nice way to engender trust,</i>
<i>Agent Jackman.</i>

30:41.356 --> 30:44.296
<i>If I wanted to expose you,</i>
<i>I could have done that six months ago</i>

30:44.396 --> 30:46.296
<i>when that file first crossed my desk.</i>

30:46.396 --> 30:48.396
<i>Expose us as what?</i>

30:48.916 --> 30:50.496
<i>Witches.</i>

30:50.596 --> 30:53.516
<i>It's the only logical explanation</i>
<i>for all the unsolved cases,</i>

30:53.836 --> 30:56.716
<i>the missing persons,</i>
<i>the mysterious deaths.</i>

30:57.396 --> 31:00.116
That is out of context. He was
a witch hunter, he tried to kill us.

31:00.716 --> 31:03.176
The only context I'm interested in is

31:03.276 --> 31:05.736
what happened to yet another

31:05.836 --> 31:08.316
officer of the law?

31:08.756 --> 31:10.756
Witness.

31:24.796 --> 31:27.716
Seems like that stream
of unsolved deaths

31:28.036 --> 31:31.656
left in the Charmed Ones' wake
just keeps right on growing, doesn't it?

31:31.756 --> 31:35.676
So I guess the obvious question is,
how many more inspectors

31:36.036 --> 31:39.016
must die before it comes to an end?

31:39.116 --> 31:42.756
- Another rhetorical question.
- Actually, no.

31:43.476 --> 31:45.656
In fact...

31:45.756 --> 31:48.056
...that is what I think

31:48.156 --> 31:50.816
becomes the salient question

31:50.916 --> 31:54.716
because the deaths could end with
Lieutenant Morris, that's what I think.

31:55.036 --> 31:56.176
What do you think?

31:56.276 --> 31:57.416
Objection.

31:57.516 --> 31:59.516
- Why should we care what he thinks?
- Phoebe.

32:00.436 --> 32:01.856
I care.

32:01.956 --> 32:04.336
Yeah, well, of course, you
care, you're a demon.

32:04.436 --> 32:06.436
I care too.

32:07.636 --> 32:08.936
Well, then never mind.

32:09.036 --> 32:11.336
I think there will always be another...

32:11.436 --> 32:13.616
...Inspector Sheridan to pick
up on their trail.

32:13.716 --> 32:16.156
- Wait a minute.
- Unless...

32:17.516 --> 32:19.516
It ends with Morris.

32:20.036 --> 32:22.296
- What?
- No further questions,

32:22.396 --> 32:24.796
rhetorical or otherwise.

32:29.516 --> 32:32.576
Oh, sorry, did you have
more questions of him?

32:32.676 --> 32:35.536
Yes, as a matter of fact.

32:35.636 --> 32:37.496
No, we're fine.

32:37.596 --> 32:40.596
- Carry on.
- Paige, what are you doing?

32:41.556 --> 32:44.496
Unfortunately for us, ending
the stream of deaths

32:44.596 --> 32:47.756
with Morris only solves
our problem with the past

32:48.076 --> 32:50.876
and does absolutely
nothing to protect us

32:51.196 --> 32:54.516
against our future problems.
So how much longer

32:54.836 --> 32:57.716
can we afford to tempt the gods
of fate

32:58.076 --> 33:00.336
with the recklessness
of the Charmed Ones?

33:00.436 --> 33:02.336
And at what point
does that day finally come

33:02.436 --> 33:05.397
when it's just simply too
late to clean up

33:05.717 --> 33:07.617
after one of their
little magical messes?

33:07.717 --> 33:10.057
And then all of magic

33:10.157 --> 33:12.977
is exposed to the world
forever because of them.

33:13.077 --> 33:16.797
And that, that's the question
you're going to have to answer

33:17.117 --> 33:19.957
because I rest my case.

33:21.917 --> 33:23.297
Gideon?

33:23.397 --> 33:25.397
Nothing further.

33:27.277 --> 33:30.197
We will return with the verdict.

33:34.957 --> 33:37.317
Okay, this better be good.

33:37.637 --> 33:39.637
Leo?

33:40.997 --> 33:42.997
Hey, you guys are speaking now.

33:43.597 --> 33:46.017
Let's not make a big
deal about it, okay?

33:46.117 --> 33:49.237
- Fine, what did you find out?
- That phantasm you vanquished,

33:49.557 --> 33:52.017
- Barbas sent it so you'd follow it.
- Yeah, apparently

33:52.117 --> 33:54.477
he gets a get-out-of-hell-free
card, too, if he wins the case.

33:54.797 --> 33:57.317
- I knew this was a setup.
- But we can't prove it

33:57.637 --> 33:59.617
so we've tried to find
another but we can't...

33:59.717 --> 34:02.517
If it's anywhere, it has to be
inside Inspector Sheridan.

34:02.837 --> 34:06.117
It's the only way Barbas knew she'd be
in the right place at the right time.

34:07.797 --> 34:10.357
Okay, go get her.
Bring her back here, hurry.

34:19.357 --> 34:22.317
Piper, what are you doing here?
How'd you do that?

34:22.677 --> 34:25.217
It's why they call it Magic School.
Come on,

34:25.317 --> 34:27.377
- I'm gonna get you out of here.
- What?

34:27.476 --> 34:30.437
- Right now, let's go.
- What do you mean, just leave?

34:30.797 --> 34:32.297
That's the idea.

34:32.397 --> 34:34.657
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

34:34.757 --> 34:37.077
We'll figure it out,
we'll fix it later.

34:39.397 --> 34:41.097
No, Piper.

34:41.197 --> 34:42.817
I can't.

34:42.917 --> 34:44.737
What if you can't fix this?

34:44.837 --> 34:46.217
What am I supposed to do then?

34:46.317 --> 34:48.317
Run? Hide?

34:48.637 --> 34:50.217
That's not right.

34:50.317 --> 34:52.456
I'm no fugitive.

34:52.556 --> 34:54.556
I'm a cop.

34:57.797 --> 35:00.697
- How did I get here?
- Piper, what are you doing here?

35:00.797 --> 35:02.217
- I don't know.
- Well,

35:02.317 --> 35:03.657
why don't you go back? Go.

35:03.757 --> 35:05.757
She can't.

35:06.757 --> 35:09.057
We have brought
her to hear the judgment.

35:09.157 --> 35:11.917
Since it impacts all of you.

35:12.237 --> 35:13.697
This doesn't look good.

35:13.797 --> 35:14.977
Where the hell is Leo?

35:15.077 --> 35:17.657
As to whether or not
the Charmed Ones shall be allowed

35:17.757 --> 35:19.937
to continue to practice magic,

35:20.037 --> 35:22.037
the judgment is

35:23.237 --> 35:25.237
in favour of the sisters.

35:25.917 --> 35:27.917
But against the lieutenant.

35:28.477 --> 35:31.357
The trail of exposure
must end with him.

35:35.797 --> 35:37.057
I'm afraid it's time.

35:37.157 --> 35:38.777
No, no, no.

35:38.877 --> 35:40.937
- No, please, please, no.
- Baby, baby, baby.

35:41.037 --> 35:43.117
No, no.

35:50.717 --> 35:52.717
Let's go.

35:58.557 --> 36:00.697
You have got to be
kidding me, right?

36:00.797 --> 36:02.457
I mean, you can't
really be doing this.

36:02.557 --> 36:04.957
Phoebe, they have already.

36:05.277 --> 36:08.757
Look, he doesn't care about
protecting magic. All he cares about

36:09.077 --> 36:11.537
is himself and getting
out of purgatory.

36:11.637 --> 36:14.377
So not only did he set us up,
but he set you up too.

36:14.477 --> 36:17.597
Always trying to blame
somebody else, aren't you?

36:17.957 --> 36:20.177
- You son of a...
- Listen, you have to stop this,

36:20.277 --> 36:23.237
do you understand? They haven't
taken your powers. But they still can.

36:23.877 --> 36:25.017
Then let them.

36:25.117 --> 36:28.057
If this is the thanks that we
get for all of our good work,

36:28.157 --> 36:31.117
if this is the way the system works,
then you can keep our stupid powers.

36:31.517 --> 36:33.797
- Paige.
- No, she's right.

36:34.117 --> 36:36.657
If Darryl dies, that's it,
we're done. We quit.

36:36.757 --> 36:40.477
You know, that would solve any
of our future exposure issues,

36:40.797 --> 36:42.217
now, wouldn't it?

36:42.317 --> 36:44.697
You'd have us erase
your memories?

36:44.797 --> 36:46.737
Change all that you know?

36:46.837 --> 36:48.537
All that you are?

36:48.637 --> 36:50.637
If necessary.

36:51.917 --> 36:53.917
Very well.

37:11.357 --> 37:13.358
Get off of me.

37:14.838 --> 37:16.458
What is this?

37:16.558 --> 37:17.738
Where, where am I?

37:17.838 --> 37:20.818
- That's a nice act, it's very convincing.
- Objection.

37:20.918 --> 37:24.198
You cannot bring a mortal
down here, it is outrageous.

37:24.558 --> 37:26.558
Sit down and shut up.

37:27.998 --> 37:29.858
What is the meaning of this?

37:29.958 --> 37:31.958
Watch.

38:02.438 --> 38:07.038
- What now?
- I'm surrounded by idiots.

38:25.278 --> 38:27.418
Guess there's some
cleaning up to do there.

38:27.518 --> 38:30.318
What do you have to say
for yourself, Barbas?

38:31.638 --> 38:34.498
I'm a demon, what do you expect?

38:34.598 --> 38:38.278
Based on the evidence, I beg you to
reverse the decision before it's too late.

38:48.758 --> 38:50.758
Darryl?

38:55.398 --> 38:57.518
Did you forget we were
gonna go out tonight?

39:18.678 --> 39:20.678
It is done.

39:21.078 --> 39:22.938
And as for you, Barbas...

39:23.038 --> 39:25.318
No, wait, wait, wait.

39:26.078 --> 39:28.418
Now, just because

39:28.518 --> 39:31.658
I'm the one that set this whole thing
up does not necessarily mean

39:31.758 --> 39:33.178
that I am not right.

39:33.278 --> 39:36.758
The Charmed Ones
are reckless with magic.

39:37.118 --> 39:39.018
- Oh, please.
- You've seen it, I've seen it,

39:39.118 --> 39:42.338
we've all seen it time after time
and it doesn't even

39:42.438 --> 39:46.278
include what got them into this
whole mess in the first place.

39:46.678 --> 39:49.218
I think that would be you.

39:49.318 --> 39:52.918
No, Phoebe, that would be you.

39:53.278 --> 39:56.278
With your ongoing zeal
to force your premonitions

39:56.638 --> 39:59.738
to short-circuit the process,

39:59.838 --> 40:02.798
take the easy way and for what?

40:03.118 --> 40:07.958
Each and every time it was
for personal gain.

40:09.438 --> 40:13.558
I don't know,
but just seems to me like

40:13.958 --> 40:16.898
it's for selfish behaviour like that,

40:16.998 --> 40:20.878
there's got to be some
consequences or, well,

40:21.198 --> 40:23.198
what's the point?

40:31.318 --> 40:34.438
Phoebe will be stripped
of her powers.

40:34.798 --> 40:37.478
- What?
- Just your active powers.

40:37.798 --> 40:40.998
- Empathy, premonitions.
- Levitation.

40:41.878 --> 40:44.118
You can earn them back.

40:44.438 --> 40:48.478
But only if you're more careful
with your powers.

40:48.798 --> 40:52.318
If you're all more careful.

40:54.838 --> 40:56.578
You can't just say that and leave.

40:56.678 --> 40:59.758
- Gideon, get them back here now.
- No. It's okay.

41:00.478 --> 41:02.618
I mean,
it might be kind of refreshing

41:02.718 --> 41:05.858
to not rely on my powers
so much anymore, you know.

41:05.958 --> 41:09.278
Besides, they're not the only ones
that think I've been misusing them.

41:11.318 --> 41:13.338
Are you sure?

41:13.438 --> 41:16.718
Yeah. Let's get out of here.

41:24.759 --> 41:27.919
Looks like I did just enough
to win the case.

41:28.239 --> 41:29.899
You know what that means?

41:29.999 --> 41:34.519
That means I'm back.

41:38.999 --> 41:42.879
I know, counsellor.

41:44.119 --> 41:46.119
I know.

41:47.959 --> 41:50.559
You're afraid.

41:51.919 --> 41:56.439
And your greatest fear is that
somehow they're going to find out

41:56.799 --> 41:59.739
that you're the one
that's after Piper's son.

41:59.839 --> 42:02.219
But don't be worried.

42:02.319 --> 42:05.339
I won't tell anyone.
I promise.

42:05.439 --> 42:08.799
Nary a soul.
