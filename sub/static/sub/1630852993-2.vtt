Thank you, Charlie. [giggles]

You're the best assistant
a magician could ask for.

00:20.228 --> 00:22.063
And the best cat
a kid could ask for.

and the best sink,

00:26.693 --> 00:29.195

00:29.279 --> 00:31.865
Whoa, Charlie,
you disappeared.

Have you seen our

01:01.895 --> 01:04.689
Ellen and Becky and I
want to put it together

Hmm.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.154
Looking for me?

01:11.237 --> 01:13.072
Cool trick, Gramsy!

01:13.156 --> 01:15.366
That's Gramsy the Great
for you.

01:15.450 --> 01:16.367
What is this?

01:16.451 --> 01:18.328
This is my old magic trunk...

and costumes

01:21.539 --> 01:23.500
from when I performed magic.

01:23.583 --> 01:24.667
You were a magician?

01:24.751 --> 01:27.587
Once a magician,
always a magician.

01:27.670 --> 01:30.882
Although I don't perform
as much as I used to.

01:30.965 --> 01:32.091
I miss it.

01:32.175 --> 01:34.469
I've always wanted
to learn magic.

01:34.552 --> 01:35.845
Well, that's perfect,

01:35.929 --> 01:37.764
'cause I've always
wanted to teach magic

01:37.847 --> 01:39.432
to someone who loves it, too.

01:39.516 --> 01:42.185
But before I can
teach you anything,

01:42.268 --> 01:45.688
you must agree
to the Magician's Code.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.023
The what now?

01:47.106 --> 01:48.608
The Magician's Code.

01:48.691 --> 01:52.654
It's a promise never to reveal
how a magic trick works

01:52.737 --> 01:54.864
except to a fellow magician.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.783
I can do that, I promise.

01:56.866 --> 01:58.201
Very good.

01:58.284 --> 02:01.204
And to make it official,
you have to sign your name

02:01.287 --> 02:03.623
in the official
Magician's Code book.

02:04.541 --> 02:05.834
Cool!

02:10.547 --> 02:13.466
Done. Now, time to learn
some magic.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.176
You're gonna need a wand.

02:24.727 --> 02:27.063
That's what
I'm gonna show you.

02:27.146 --> 02:29.065
First, hold the hat out.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.483
Then...

02:30.567 --> 02:32.360
This is very important.

Did you find Gramsy,
or the puzzle?

02:52.505 --> 02:55.425
-Oh, hi, Gramsy.
-No puzzle.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.678
But check it, Gramsy was
showing me her magic trunk!

02:58.761 --> 03:00.096
Cool!

03:00.179 --> 03:02.432
Ooh, magic trunks are
my favorite kind of trunks!

03:02.515 --> 03:03.725
No, swimming trunks.

No, elephant...

How about you sit
your booties down over there

03:07.854 --> 03:09.981

a little show for you?

03:10.064 --> 03:13.109
I'm going to sit
my booty down so fast.

Also the only magic show
I've ever seen.

special performance...

04:16.214 --> 04:18.675

-Amazing!

04:56.629 --> 04:58.131
-Whoo!
-Yeah!

05:01.175 --> 05:03.344
Freckle, you've got
to teach us that trick.

05:03.428 --> 05:04.429
I don't know.

05:04.512 --> 05:07.390
Gramsy said... Wait.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.434
Where did Gramsy go?

05:10.059 --> 05:11.269
Magic.

05:11.352 --> 05:12.228
Exactly!

05:12.311 --> 05:13.604
And now you're magic, too.

05:13.688 --> 05:15.398
You've got to tell us
how the trick works.

05:15.481 --> 05:18.943
I always say I want to be able
to pull flowers out of a hat

05:19.027 --> 05:20.486
anytime I want them.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.280
I've never heard you say that.

05:22.363 --> 05:23.698
Well, not out loud.

05:23.781 --> 05:25.700
Please, Freckle.

05:25.783 --> 05:27.577
It's just that...

05:27.660 --> 05:28.953
Please?

05:31.122 --> 05:33.332
Mmm... I can't.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.585
To be a magician,
I had to promise

05:35.668 --> 05:37.837
I would never reveal
how the trick works.

05:37.920 --> 05:40.298
I signed the Magician's Code
and everything.

05:40.381 --> 05:41.632
Seems legit.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.509
Can't argue with a magic book.

05:43.593 --> 05:46.846
We definitely wouldn't
want you to break your promise.

05:46.929 --> 05:48.681
But...

05:48.765 --> 05:50.266
it doesn't say
anywhere in here

05:50.349 --> 05:52.560
that you can't show us
the trick some more.

05:52.643 --> 05:54.437
Wow, you're a fast reader.

05:54.520 --> 05:55.396
I skimmed it.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.356
Wow, you're fast skimmer.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.108
I'm pretty sure you could
show us the trick

05:59.192 --> 06:00.818
as many times as you want.

06:00.902 --> 06:03.696
-Right, Freckle?
-[hesitantly] Right.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.282
[inaudible]

06:07.617 --> 06:09.786
I do need more practice.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.579
Okay, okay, okay.
I'll do it.

06:11.662 --> 06:13.706
[both laughing]

06:15.500 --> 06:17.085
-Watching?
-Mmm-hmm.

06:19.712 --> 06:20.671
Ta-da!

06:20.755 --> 06:21.839
[gasps]

06:21.923 --> 06:23.925
It's just as magical
the second time.

06:24.008 --> 06:25.635
Magical but fast.

06:25.718 --> 06:27.303
I didn't see how you did it.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.680
Do it again... slower.

06:37.647 --> 06:38.815
Nope. Again.

06:38.898 --> 06:39.899
Even slower.

06:40.566 --> 06:41.901
[sighs]

06:51.410 --> 06:53.412
It's magical every time.

06:53.496 --> 06:54.497
Ugh!

06:54.580 --> 06:57.166
How do you do it?
I need to know!

06:57.250 --> 06:59.335
And I need a break.

06:59.418 --> 07:01.504
Magic is exhausting.

07:01.587 --> 07:04.006
If we can't learn the trick
by watching you do it,

07:04.090 --> 07:06.425
then we'll just try
to do it ourselves

07:06.509 --> 07:07.760
until we figure it out.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.137
You will?

07:09.220 --> 07:10.304
We will?

07:10.388 --> 07:12.014
Yep. Nothin' to it
but to do it.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.183
This is gonna be good.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.060
First we need hats.

07:17.687 --> 07:20.314
Safety first, magic second.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.024
This will do.

07:22.108 --> 07:25.570
Watching you try
is gonna be even more fun
than doing it myself.

07:27.155 --> 07:29.532
Okay. Now, wands.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.534
Got mine.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.661
-Ready?
-Beignetti.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.540
-Mine's empty.
-Mine too.

07:37.623 --> 07:38.958
Maybe it's the hats?

07:39.041 --> 07:40.293
Let's swap.

07:41.961 --> 07:42.879
Aw, poodles!

07:42.962 --> 07:44.297
Still nothing!

07:44.380 --> 07:45.715
Maybe try new hats?

07:47.800 --> 07:50.303
-[Becky gasps]
-Hey, how'd you do that?

07:50.386 --> 07:51.971
Nope, don't tell me.

07:52.054 --> 07:53.347
One trick at the time.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.100
How about this one?

07:57.185 --> 07:58.269
This one?

07:58.352 --> 08:01.480
This one looks stylish
and magical.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.816
[sighs] Just stylish.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.735
This is so frustrating.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.445
None of these work!

08:09.697 --> 08:11.115
I know how you did it.

08:11.199 --> 08:13.326
You had the flowers
up your sleeve the whole time.

08:13.409 --> 08:15.411
I don't have sleeves.

08:15.494 --> 08:17.580
He made his sleeves disappear.

08:17.663 --> 08:18.998
-Mmm-mmm.
-Ugh!

08:19.081 --> 08:22.001
I don't know what to say.
I can't figure it out.

08:22.084 --> 08:24.545
Oh, Magic words!
Let's try saying magic words.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.088
Yes. Great idea, Becky.

08:26.172 --> 08:30.718
But I don't say magic words
when I... Never mind.

08:30.801 --> 08:31.677
Let's hear 'em.

08:32.762 --> 08:35.681
Flowers, flowers,
we want them now!

08:35.765 --> 08:38.809
Why won't Freckle
show us how?

08:38.893 --> 08:41.979
Abraca-poodle!
Flowers-doodle!

08:42.063 --> 08:44.607
-No!
-Why?

08:45.816 --> 08:46.651
Oh.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.322
Why, oh, why?

08:51.405 --> 08:53.616
I just want flowers!

08:53.699 --> 08:55.785
Maybe you should just give up?

08:56.452 --> 08:57.453
Give up?

08:58.204 --> 08:59.372
Never.

08:59.455 --> 09:01.958
Roses are red, violets are...

09:02.041 --> 09:03.417
Wait, it's that hat.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.419
We have to do this trick
with that hat.

09:06.629 --> 09:09.423
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
That's Gramsy's hat.

09:09.507 --> 09:11.634
Nothing. This trick
is too tricky!

09:11.717 --> 09:13.511
Be careful with it, you two!

09:13.594 --> 09:14.887
How do you do it?

09:16.472 --> 09:17.473
[groans]

09:17.557 --> 09:18.849
Like this!

09:29.068 --> 09:30.945
[both] Ah!

09:32.238 --> 09:34.991
[gasps] I revealed
how the trick works.

09:35.074 --> 09:36.659
What have I done?

09:36.742 --> 09:38.160
It'll be okay, Freckle.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.496
Sorry. We wanted
to know so bad.

09:40.579 --> 09:42.248
We didn't mean
to break your code.

09:42.331 --> 09:43.833
It's not your fault.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.210
I broke the Magician's Code.

09:46.294 --> 09:47.795
I got to tell Gramsy.

09:47.878 --> 09:48.838
[Gramsy] Tell me what?

09:51.507 --> 09:53.676
We'll let you
talk to her alone.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.594
[whispers] I still think
you're magnificent.

09:59.724 --> 10:03.185
Gramsy, I...
I broke the Magician's Code.

10:03.269 --> 10:06.981
Ellen and Becky really wanted
to know how the trick works.

10:07.064 --> 10:08.357
And they kept trying.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.027
And I felt so bad
that they couldn't get it.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.194
And I told them.

10:13.779 --> 10:16.157
[sighs] Now I can't be
a magician anymore.

10:21.370 --> 10:25.708
It's okay that you revealed
how the trick works
to Ellen and Becky.

10:25.791 --> 10:28.961
Those two can
wear anyone down.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.630
You can still be
a magician, Freckle.

10:31.714 --> 10:33.090
I can?

10:33.174 --> 10:35.593
You proved how much
you respect the Magician's Code

10:35.676 --> 10:37.219
by telling me the truth.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.805
And there are
plenty of other tricks
for you to learn

10:39.889 --> 10:42.350
that I'm certain
you won't reveal.

10:42.433 --> 10:43.976
Thanks, Gramsy.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.895
But I tore my name
out of the book.

10:50.733 --> 10:51.650
Open it.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.573
[gasps]

10:57.656 --> 10:58.616
How did you do that?

10:58.699 --> 11:01.535
Gramsy the Great never tells,

11:01.619 --> 11:03.788
except to teach
another magician.

11:03.871 --> 11:06.165
Oh, Gramsy,
you're the greatest!

11:06.248 --> 11:09.418
Gramsy the Greatest.
I like that.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.420
Freckle! We found our puzzle!

11:11.504 --> 11:12.880
Yeah. I waved my wand

11:12.963 --> 11:14.924
and made it appear
out of thin air.

11:15.007 --> 11:16.342
And by that
I mean I remembered

11:16.425 --> 11:17.968
I'd left it
in the Besties Bus.

11:18.052 --> 11:20.346
Maybe we can do more
magic lessons tomorrow?

11:20.429 --> 11:22.681
That would be magnificent.

11:26.102 --> 11:28.771
A piece is missing.
Must have disappeared.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.564
[gasps] Magic!

11:30.648 --> 11:32.316
