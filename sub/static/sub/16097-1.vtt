04:00.330 --> 04:02.373
You want it?

04:04.417 --> 04:06.836
Is it yours?

04:06.920 --> 04:08.963
No, not mine.

04:10.715 --> 04:12.759
Yours.

04:18.055 --> 04:20.141
How much do you want for it?

04:21.392 --> 04:23.436
Whatever you think it's worth.

04:35.198 --> 04:37.241
Exactly the figure I had in mind.

04:37.325 --> 04:39.661
Take pleasure in it.

04:42.455 --> 04:45.541
'Most nights,
this inner city emergency room

04:45.625 --> 04:49.587
'would be a chaos of blood, panic
and grace under pressure,

04:49.670 --> 04:51.714
'but, tonight, as you see,

04:51.798 --> 04:53.925
'it's as if death took a holiday.'

04:54.008 --> 04:58.971
It's a mystery to me, a mystery how those
assholes at Assignment knew it.

04:59.055 --> 05:02.934
This is Joey Summerskill,
for Channel 8, Emergency Room.

05:03.017 --> 05:05.061
Very bored, no story,

05:05.144 --> 05:06.979
no life,

05:07.063 --> 05:09.357
really, really pissed off.

05:12.318 --> 05:14.487
Break it down, Doc, it's a wrap.

05:15.905 --> 05:18.491
Joey, rein it in, kid.
They couldn't have known.

05:18.574 --> 05:20.618
I know, I know.

05:20.701 --> 05:22.829
It's just so... neat, isn't it?

05:22.912 --> 05:27.833
My first gig that isn't kindergarten kids
or diet gurus is taken away from me.

05:28.918 --> 05:33.005
Well, like you say, it's a mystery,
but that's all it is, a mystery.

05:33.089 --> 05:38.803
Not malice. You really think the station
bought off every accident victim in the city?

05:44.350 --> 05:46.811
- Speak.
- 'Doc, 24th and Cedar - fast.

05:46.894 --> 05:48.771
'Hostage situation.'

05:48.854 --> 05:52.608
- Joey's here. Can we go together?
- 'No need. Martin's there.

05:52.692 --> 05:54.860
'Hurry. We got an ambulance to beat.'

05:56.946 --> 06:00.074
Better hurry, Doc.
A real story with a real reporter.

06:00.992 --> 06:04.662
Joey, look, can I take you home?
I can go by your place.

06:04.745 --> 06:08.249
You'll miss the money shots. No.
I'll catch a bus. Don't worry.

06:08.332 --> 06:11.377
OK, but be careful.

06:11.460 --> 06:16.006
And lighten up. The story of your life
could be around the corner.

06:18.634 --> 06:20.678
It is the story of my life.

07:06.682 --> 07:08.726
- Let's go!
- 10mg IV!

07:08.809 --> 07:10.561
It wasn't my fault.

07:10.644 --> 07:13.731
- Ever seen anything like this before?
- Sure.

07:15.983 --> 07:17.568
Help me.

07:19.069 --> 07:21.405
It's got nothing to do with me.

07:27.953 --> 07:30.372
What are you going to do?
Don't hurt him!

07:30.456 --> 07:32.916
Oh, God!

07:33.000 --> 07:35.502
Wait, I'm a reporter.
Tell me what happened.

07:35.586 --> 07:38.922
Sorry, you can't go in.

07:39.465 --> 07:42.259
Wait! Wait, please. I need to talk to you.

07:42.342 --> 07:46.096
I wasn't even with him!
Look, lady, I told you, it's not my problem.

07:46.180 --> 07:48.223
I was just there, right?

07:48.307 --> 07:50.350
- Where?
- The Boiler Room.

07:50.434 --> 07:54.771
- Can I go now?
- What is the Boiler Room? Where is it?

07:58.275 --> 08:00.319
Stay away from him!
Get away from him!

09:31.743 --> 09:34.079
'Tell us about your book.'

09:35.914 --> 09:37.666
'Tell us about your book.'

09:37.749 --> 09:40.460
See? This is what I mean.

09:40.543 --> 09:43.588
Your technique, it's all wrong.

09:47.342 --> 09:50.595
- What do you mean, technique?
- Hardly any thigh.

09:50.679 --> 09:52.764
An inch more flesh, the boys upstairs get

09:52.764 --> 09:55.767
hot - bingo, you're an anchorwoman.

09:55.850 --> 09:57.894
Oh, come on, Brad, give her a break.

09:57.978 --> 10:02.148
This may be a surprise to you, Brad,
but I want to do this the right way.

10:02.232 --> 10:04.359
Tight stories not tight skirts.

10:04.442 --> 10:09.322
- Right, right. Like last night's news.
- I know what I saw.

10:09.406 --> 10:12.909
This is TV. No pictures, no story.

10:12.992 --> 10:15.036
There is a story out there.

10:19.131 --> 10:20.375
$10, please.

10:54.555 --> 10:57.099
Excuse me.

10:57.182 --> 10:59.935
- Can I help?
- I'm looking for a pretty girl.

11:00.019 --> 11:01.937
JP Monroe. That way.

11:39.516 --> 11:43.896
I'm looking for a girl. She's got dark hair,
dark eyes, about this tall.

11:43.979 --> 11:46.648
- She's really pretty.
- That doesn't help.

11:46.732 --> 11:50.194
- I heard she might be JP's girlfriend.
- It could be Terri.

11:50.277 --> 11:52.654
If so, JP will be in the restaurant.

12:09.967 --> 12:11.969
Pout. Come on.

12:12.052 --> 12:14.263
- Excuse me.
- Pout, baby, pout.

12:14.346 --> 12:16.223
Oh, yeah.

12:16.306 --> 12:18.600
- Excuse me.
- Oh, yeah.

12:20.686 --> 12:22.896
Do you own this place?

12:22.980 --> 12:24.856
And everything in it.

12:24.940 --> 12:26.858
Right. Um...

12:26.942 --> 12:30.195
Listen, there is this girl, maybe Terri.

12:30.278 --> 12:32.489
Young, pretty, jet-black hair.

12:32.572 --> 12:36.034
I think she's a regular here
and I need to find her.

12:39.329 --> 12:43.709
I don't think I'm your type.
I'm out of grade school.

13:46.313 --> 13:48.356
Where are you going?

13:48.440 --> 13:51.318
My daddy's still alive! He's still alive!

13:54.237 --> 13:56.948
Come!
Come back and save my daddy!

14:00.869 --> 14:04.748
- Yeah?
- 'Hi, is this Joanne Summerskill? '

14:04.831 --> 14:08.209
- This is Joey. Who's this?
- 'You left me your card at the club.'

14:08.293 --> 14:11.796
- Right.
- 'Right, Terri, so, what do you want? '

14:11.880 --> 14:13.548
I want to talk to you.

14:13.631 --> 14:17.635
Look, don't hang up, OK?
I met you the other night at the hospital.

14:17.719 --> 14:20.263
'Yeah, well, I'll make a deal with you.

14:21.097 --> 14:26.144
'My boyfriend threw me out, so you give me
a place to crash and I'll talk, OK? '

14:26.227 --> 14:28.271
Yeah, sure. You mean tonight?

14:28.354 --> 14:32.192
'Of course, tonight. Is that a problem?
You got a guy there? '

14:32.275 --> 14:34.319
No, no, that's fine. Come now.

14:34.527 --> 14:36.738
I was having bad dreams, anyway.

14:38.156 --> 14:40.491
So what was your dream?

14:40.575 --> 14:43.703
- What?
- You said you were having a bad dream.

14:43.786 --> 14:45.663
Oh, yeah.

14:46.456 --> 14:49.167
Well, it's not a nightmare or anything.

14:49.876 --> 14:51.502
I...

14:51.586 --> 14:55.465
- Well, I know what it is.
- What is it?

14:58.509 --> 15:01.429
Why are you so interested?

15:02.639 --> 15:06.559
- Sorry.
- No, it's OK. It's my father.

15:06.643 --> 15:09.354
Oh, right. Well, did he used to...

15:09.437 --> 15:12.899
No, no, nothing like that, no.

15:12.982 --> 15:15.777
He died before I was born. Vietnam.

15:16.736 --> 15:19.405
We don't know the details,

15:19.489 --> 15:22.784
but I dream of death and...

15:24.035 --> 15:26.079
trying to save him.

15:26.162 --> 15:28.081
Man, that's great.

15:29.082 --> 15:32.668
- Excuse me?
- I don't mean about your dad or anything.

15:32.752 --> 15:34.587
It's... just, erm...

15:35.588 --> 15:39.759
I don't dream. Never have.

15:39.842 --> 15:42.553
Maybe it would help if I slept some time.

15:42.637 --> 15:44.680
I'm just kidding.

15:44.764 --> 15:49.477
No, it's just really neat for me
to hear about dreams. I'm jealous.

15:49.560 --> 15:52.438
It's like everyone has another world
except for me.

15:52.522 --> 15:56.317
It's just... me, my bag,

15:56.400 --> 15:59.028
and a series of shithead boyfriends.

16:00.821 --> 16:02.865
Be nice to see something else,

16:03.658 --> 16:05.993
have a night-time world.

16:06.827 --> 16:08.704
Hey, this is great, isn't it?

16:08.788 --> 16:10.831
I mean, just, er...

16:10.915 --> 16:12.959
two girls, talking,

16:13.876 --> 16:16.379
having a conversation.

16:16.462 --> 16:18.506
Good coffee.

16:19.423 --> 16:23.094
- You got a cigarette?
- Uh, yeah, just a second.

16:32.937 --> 16:34.980
Great, thanks.

16:35.064 --> 16:38.484
- Are you going to have one?
- I'm trying to quit.

16:39.318 --> 16:42.530
Go on. What the fuck, huh?

16:42.613 --> 16:45.491
Do you think you're going to live forever?

16:56.919 --> 16:58.963
Oh, you want to talk about that, huh?

16:59.046 --> 17:03.342
Something awful happened to that boy
and I have to know what it was.

17:03.425 --> 17:06.095
Look, I don't know anything, all right?

17:06.887 --> 17:10.432
I come out of the club,
the kid's already lying in the street.

17:10.516 --> 17:12.434
- Did you know him?
- No.

17:13.560 --> 17:16.771
OK, I've seen him in the club
a couple of times.

17:16.856 --> 17:20.358
He's a punkhead. I never really danced
with him or anything.

17:20.442 --> 17:23.487
And he was a thief.
He must have taken it from a statue.

17:23.570 --> 17:27.324
- Taken what?
- That thing.

17:28.409 --> 17:31.704
He's lying in the street, moaning,
and pointing at it.

17:31.787 --> 17:34.832
But the chains, where did they come from?

17:34.915 --> 17:37.668
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

17:48.387 --> 17:50.514
He said it came out of this.

18:31.529 --> 18:33.406
Oh, what the...

19:14.030 --> 19:16.490
Get off!

19:25.041 --> 19:26.542
Bitch!

20:11.913 --> 20:16.542
- Did I sleep through an earthquake?
- I thought I'd make breakfast.

20:16.626 --> 20:19.170
Oh, that's really nice of you, Terri.

20:21.088 --> 20:23.799
Can I ask, is it always this exploratory?

20:23.883 --> 20:25.927
Uh, I don't know.

20:26.010 --> 20:29.347
It's my first time. I'm a kitchen virgin.

20:30.264 --> 20:33.267
- I'll boil some water.
- No, I'll do it.

20:33.351 --> 20:37.772
No, no, it's OK. I like boiling water.
It's a speciality of mine.

20:38.397 --> 20:40.858
Look, why don't you go watch some...

20:40.942 --> 20:42.985
some cartoons?

20:47.198 --> 20:49.283
This is a really great place.

20:52.828 --> 20:55.206
This is yours? You, like, own this?

20:56.082 --> 20:58.918
Well, the bank owns it,
but I'm working on it.

21:01.462 --> 21:05.966
I haven't even had a place of my own
since I was 15.

21:07.218 --> 21:09.261
Ow, ow.

21:10.763 --> 21:14.725
What a great view. This is a great view.
Would you look at this?

21:14.809 --> 21:19.939
Well, actually I'm pretty familiar
with the view. But it is good.

21:20.022 --> 21:23.859
You know, over to the left,
you can... see...

21:27.780 --> 21:29.824
I love it here.

21:31.283 --> 21:33.327
I have to solve this thing.

21:33.410 --> 21:36.247
I have to find out what's going on.

21:36.330 --> 21:39.375
- You mentioned a statue.
- Yeah, I found it.

21:39.458 --> 21:43.087
- I knew he'd like it.
- Oh, wait a minute. He, who? The kid?

21:43.170 --> 21:45.464
No, JP, my last boyfriend.

21:45.548 --> 21:48.342
He owns a club.
You know, you were there.

21:48.425 --> 21:52.596
- He bought the statue.
- That you found.

21:52.680 --> 21:54.723
What do you mean, you found it?

21:54.807 --> 21:59.520
Well, there's a store. It's really hip.
Lots of weird shit in there.

21:59.603 --> 22:02.731
I don't know, I saw this statue pillar thing...

22:02.815 --> 22:05.401
I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.

22:05.484 --> 22:08.112
Would you know the place
if you saw it again?

22:08.195 --> 22:11.198
- Sure. Why?
- We're going shopping.

22:21.875 --> 22:25.671
- Maybe they're closed today.
- Closed every day.

22:25.754 --> 22:28.632
Owner's in Hawaii.
Been there about a month.

22:29.299 --> 22:32.719
Bull. My boyfriend bought something here
last week.

22:32.803 --> 22:34.638
Couldn't have.

22:34.721 --> 22:37.433
- Are you sure?
- Sure. Lived here 20 years.

22:37.516 --> 22:39.601
I see everything. Come on.

22:44.314 --> 22:46.733
Dead end.

22:46.817 --> 22:49.069
Still, there's a back door, right?

22:51.446 --> 22:53.866
Five seconds, we're browsing.

23:03.458 --> 23:06.461
Wow. I didn't think this place
would be like this.

23:07.754 --> 23:10.048
These places are always all show.

23:10.132 --> 23:12.718
Do you break into a lot of art galleries?

23:12.801 --> 23:16.555
I break in anywhere if it's raining
and I need a place to sleep.

23:16.638 --> 23:18.682
So what are we looking for?

23:18.765 --> 23:21.602
Anything. Contacts, clues...

23:22.686 --> 23:24.730
Anything.

23:30.402 --> 23:34.990
Oh, this is going to take forever.

23:37.743 --> 23:40.287
How much do you think
your ex paid for that?

23:40.370 --> 23:42.873
Whatever it took. Why?

23:44.499 --> 23:47.544
Because this place is a scam.

23:47.627 --> 23:53.341
Half the stuff was picked up for pennies.
School art classes, bankruptcy sales...

23:53.425 --> 23:55.802
And closed-down lunatic asylums.

23:55.886 --> 23:59.931
Property of the Shanard Institute.

24:00.015 --> 24:02.058
Hey, Joey.

24:02.142 --> 24:06.146
- Yeah?
- Check it out.

24:06.229 --> 24:08.607
It's the box.

24:38.929 --> 24:40.680
Ooh, ouch, hubba, hubba...

24:58.698 --> 25:00.158
Hi, baby.

25:02.660 --> 25:05.288
- Welcome.
- You're JP Monroe, right?

25:05.372 --> 25:07.332
- Right.
- And this is your club?

25:07.415 --> 25:10.126
- Right again.
- Great club. I love it here.

25:10.210 --> 25:12.837
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the rose.

25:12.921 --> 25:18.134
That's a prize. You won it. I only award that
to a woman of exceptional beauty.

25:18.218 --> 25:21.095
Lots of girls here
are better looking than I am.

25:21.179 --> 25:23.515
No, no, no, no, no. Don't do that.

25:23.598 --> 25:25.642
Don't put yourself down.

25:25.725 --> 25:28.478
If you have a quality,
you should be proud of that.

25:28.561 --> 25:31.606
Let that define you, whatever it is.

26:49.100 --> 26:51.143
It's Joey Summerskill again.

26:51.227 --> 26:55.398
For half an hour you've been dicking me
around about this tape.

26:55.481 --> 26:59.652
I know it's late. I don't want to have
to get my station manager involved.

26:59.735 --> 27:01.571
So, for the last time,

27:01.654 --> 27:06.200
please get me whoever is in charge
of the Shanard video archives?

27:06.284 --> 27:09.245
Thank you. Of course I'll hold.

27:14.875 --> 27:17.295
Dr Fallan, how nice of you to take my call.

27:17.378 --> 27:19.422
Can you hold on for a second?

27:19.505 --> 27:21.549
Terri! What are you doing?

27:21.632 --> 27:23.843
Can you just wait two seconds?

27:25.886 --> 27:29.473
Dr Fallan, so sorry.

27:29.557 --> 27:32.351
Michael? We need the Kirsty Cotton tape.

27:32.435 --> 27:34.687
Your assistant has all the details.

27:34.770 --> 27:36.814
OK, thanks a lot.

27:36.897 --> 27:38.941
Bye-bye.

27:39.025 --> 27:41.027
Yeah!

27:41.110 --> 27:43.154
So, you got what you needed.

27:43.237 --> 27:45.281
So, I guess we're all done.

27:45.364 --> 27:47.408
So, uh...

27:47.491 --> 27:49.535
So long.

27:49.618 --> 27:51.662
Where will you go?

27:53.914 --> 27:58.169
Look, you know there's a spare room
and you can always stay.

27:58.252 --> 28:01.714
If you want.
You're more than welcome to, really.

28:02.339 --> 28:04.383
Uh, wow, um...

28:05.551 --> 28:07.595
That's great.

28:09.305 --> 28:11.390
Um... I'll do breakfast.

28:23.736 --> 28:25.571
So cool.

28:25.654 --> 28:27.698
Radical.

28:28.782 --> 28:30.826
Wow, you've got great taste.

28:31.577 --> 28:33.621
This really says it, you know.

28:33.704 --> 28:37.458
It's really... It's really dark.

28:37.541 --> 28:39.585
- Don't you think?
- Mm-hm.

28:40.836 --> 28:43.547
Do you mind me talking about your stuff?

28:45.758 --> 28:47.801
If it bothers you, just say so.

28:47.885 --> 28:51.055
- Doesn't bother me. I'm just not interested.
- Oh.

28:51.889 --> 28:54.266
Like I'm not an interesting person?

28:57.519 --> 28:59.605
But you gave me a rose.

28:59.688 --> 29:02.816
And tomorrow,
I'll give one to somebody else.

29:03.567 --> 29:06.737
Now, get dressed
and get out of here.

29:07.696 --> 29:09.740
You shit.

29:09.823 --> 29:12.409
Who do you think you are?

29:12.493 --> 29:14.328
I'm JP Monroe, right?

29:14.411 --> 29:18.499
You stupid bitch, give me back my shirt
and get the fuck out of my life.

29:18.582 --> 29:20.626
I can't fucking believe you.

29:20.709 --> 29:24.588
You bastard! You get me in here and...

29:24.671 --> 29:27.925
Like you were at fucking gunpoint,
you stupid...

29:28.008 --> 29:30.928
You think you're some goddam prince
or something!

29:32.095 --> 29:36.808
With your shitty little kingdom out there
and all this ugly shit!

30:32.656 --> 30:34.491
Jesus Christ!

30:34.574 --> 30:36.409
Not quite.

30:39.454 --> 30:42.249
What did you see? The same as I?

30:42.332 --> 30:46.044
Appetite sated, desire indulged,

30:46.127 --> 30:49.840
a miniature of the world
and how it will succumb to us.

30:49.923 --> 30:52.926
You enjoyed the girl.

30:54.010 --> 30:55.846
Yes...

30:56.513 --> 30:58.723
Good. So did I.

30:59.641 --> 31:01.476
And that's all.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.104
No, it's not the same.

31:04.187 --> 31:07.315
I just know, what you did,
that was fucking evil.

31:10.568 --> 31:16.241
Oh, how uncomfortable that word must feel
on your lips, "evil", "good."

31:16.324 --> 31:21.204
There is no good, Monroe.
There is no evil. There is only flesh

31:21.288 --> 31:24.833
and the patterns to which we submit it.

31:25.583 --> 31:28.211
You will help me to...

31:28.294 --> 31:33.133
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
No fucking way, man.

31:35.051 --> 31:36.928
No fucking way.

31:41.307 --> 31:43.351
Oh, how touching.

31:43.435 --> 31:46.938
That is the gun you used to kill your parents.

31:48.606 --> 31:53.695
I understand. Their fortune was so tempting,
their affection so conditional,

31:53.778 --> 31:56.030
what else could you do?

31:56.114 --> 31:58.158
Fuck you.

32:05.331 --> 32:09.294
Now, can we talk sensibly?

32:12.672 --> 32:14.716
No.

32:16.676 --> 32:18.720
Don't flee from yourself.

32:18.803 --> 32:23.683
If you have a quality, be proud of it.
Let it define you, whatever it is.

32:25.184 --> 32:27.896
By helping me you will help yourself.

32:29.355 --> 32:31.941
Oh, yes, you want to.

32:32.025 --> 32:35.069
You always have.

32:35.153 --> 32:38.489
With your paintings, your sculptures...

32:38.573 --> 32:41.200
Look at these tawdry representations

32:41.284 --> 32:46.289
and then imagine a world of the body
as canvas, the body as clay.

32:46.372 --> 32:49.834
Your will and mine
as the brush and the knife.

32:49.917 --> 32:52.378
Mr Monroe!

32:52.462 --> 32:55.006
Mr Monroe, are you all right in there?

32:56.716 --> 33:02.346
- Mr Monroe!
- There is a place at my right hand for you.

33:03.264 --> 33:06.017
For a man of your tastes.

33:06.100 --> 33:09.896
Tastes I can help you to indulge.

33:11.898 --> 33:15.193
Flesh, power,

33:15.276 --> 33:17.320
dominion.

33:17.403 --> 33:19.447
Mr Monroe!

33:25.536 --> 33:27.580
I heard some shots. Are you OK?

33:29.415 --> 33:31.459
Everything's fine.

33:50.436 --> 33:52.271
How do we start?

33:52.355 --> 33:54.982
It has already begun.

33:56.651 --> 33:59.195
Hey, Joey.

33:59.278 --> 34:01.864
Wait up. Where are you going?

34:01.947 --> 34:05.618
Oh, I need to get some fresh air.
I've been stuck in the office all day.

34:06.452 --> 34:09.955
This just came for you.
Something for your story?

34:10.748 --> 34:13.626
Erm... I hope so.

34:13.708 --> 34:16.712
This story, Joey, if I can help in any way,

34:16.795 --> 34:19.632
you've got my number, all right?

34:19.715 --> 34:21.550
OK. Thanks.

34:35.063 --> 34:38.192
'I don't know what the box is,
but I know what it does.

34:38.275 --> 34:40.402
'I've said all this before.

34:40.902 --> 34:44.364
'I saw it open. I opened it.

34:45.074 --> 34:47.701
'And I saw what came out.

34:47.784 --> 34:51.413
'I don't know what else to call them.
Demons.

34:52.373 --> 34:54.583
'Demons live in the box.

34:54.667 --> 34:56.960
'It's a gateway to Hell.

34:57.043 --> 34:59.296
'Look, I know you don't believe me.

35:00.089 --> 35:02.132
'I know how it sounds.

35:02.675 --> 35:05.678
'What else? What else?

35:08.430 --> 35:11.141
'Can you turn that fucking thing off?

35:15.938 --> 35:19.191
'Again? The box.

35:20.275 --> 35:22.319
'I don't know what it's for

35:22.403 --> 35:24.822
'or who made it, or why.

35:25.739 --> 35:29.618
'I only know what it does. It hurts.

35:30.619 --> 35:33.122
'It hurts.

35:34.498 --> 35:38.919
'It kind of... opens itself.

35:40.838 --> 35:45.384
'Your fingers move and you learn.

35:46.885 --> 35:49.138
'It wants to open, that's the thing,

35:49.221 --> 35:51.223
'and it helps, and then they come.

35:51.306 --> 35:53.225
'The demons.'

35:56.353 --> 35:58.564
'She's telling the truth, Joey.'

36:03.694 --> 36:06.071
What the...

36:10.325 --> 36:13.537
'... and then they come, the demons.'

37:30.280 --> 37:33.074
Man, Joey must have polished you up some.

37:40.540 --> 37:43.209
She must be weirder than me.

38:25.293 --> 38:27.128
Joey?

38:27.212 --> 38:28.880
Not quite.

38:30.131 --> 38:32.675
- JP?
- Alive and in the flesh.

38:32.759 --> 38:35.261
How are you doing, baby?

38:35.345 --> 38:37.889
- What do you want?
- I'm just concerned.

38:37.972 --> 38:40.016
I'm just checking in.

38:40.099 --> 38:44.020
- How did you get this number?
- Will you relax, honey?

38:44.103 --> 38:47.982
Your girlfriend left cards all over the club,
remember?

38:48.066 --> 38:51.319
'Uh, yeah. Well, I'm fine.'

38:52.111 --> 38:55.240
Joey's going to get me a job
at the TV station,

38:55.323 --> 39:00.370
and I'm meeting a lot of new people,
it's really great.

39:00.954 --> 39:05.250
Now, come on. You can't tell me
you haven't thought about me.

39:05.333 --> 39:08.503
Course I have. I mean, I've thought.

39:10.964 --> 39:13.383
God, JP, you were really horrible.

39:13.466 --> 39:16.552
I am a bad guy

39:16.636 --> 39:20.640
but I try not to be, I really do,
and I really miss you.

39:22.225 --> 39:24.268
I miss you, too.

39:24.352 --> 39:27.897
Good. Why don't you come over here?

39:28.856 --> 39:33.319
'Nothing heavy, just a little drink, maybe,
see how we both feel.'

39:33.403 --> 39:35.446
No, I can't.

39:37.573 --> 39:40.076
I just can't.

39:42.578 --> 39:44.622
Shit!

39:46.082 --> 39:48.126
Shit! Shit!

39:53.589 --> 39:56.634
'This is Joey. Speak.'

39:56.717 --> 39:59.053
'Hey, Joey, congratulations.

39:59.137 --> 40:02.557
'You may not have heard,
but you got that job in Monterey.

40:02.640 --> 40:06.352
'Now you're going to have to sell me
your condo.'

40:19.740 --> 40:21.784
Terri?

40:34.797 --> 40:36.841
"Enjoy Monterey, you liar."

40:41.112 --> 40:43.156
Come on in.

40:49.620 --> 40:51.664
Not a good neighbourhood.

40:51.748 --> 40:53.791
People disappear.

40:53.875 --> 40:56.836
So, feel like home?
It's just like you left it, baby.

40:56.919 --> 40:58.921
Not quite.

40:59.005 --> 41:01.257
- That wasn't here.
- This?

41:01.340 --> 41:04.218
Well, as you can see,
I'm having some work done on this.

41:04.302 --> 41:09.515
You found a real treasure for me here.
I just hope I can show you how grateful I am.

41:09.599 --> 41:11.642
Yeah? Well, it looks different.

41:11.726 --> 41:14.520
A girl I know helped to smarten it up a bit.

41:14.604 --> 41:17.064
She put her heart and soul into this.

41:20.401 --> 41:22.403
What a girl. Anyone I should know?

41:22.487 --> 41:27.116
No. Honey, now that you're here,
it's like she doesn't even exist.

41:27.200 --> 41:29.243
You know what I mean, right?

41:30.244 --> 41:32.288
Yeah, right. Look, JP...

41:33.122 --> 41:35.625
Terri, Terri, Terri, Terri...

41:35.708 --> 41:39.086
You know it's got to be ticking away
in both our minds.

41:39.170 --> 41:42.465
Is it going to happen,
isn't it going to happen?

41:42.548 --> 41:47.386
Come on, baby. Come on. Come on.

41:48.721 --> 41:51.265
You know we gotta get this out of the way.

41:51.349 --> 41:53.809
Then we can relax. We can talk.

41:54.560 --> 41:57.229
I don't think so.

41:58.397 --> 42:00.441
Not yet.

42:00.524 --> 42:03.903
Sure. Sure, I understand.

42:04.445 --> 42:08.032
- I'm just not ready yet.
- Registered.

42:08.115 --> 42:11.619
It's cool. I mean, hey, we got all night, right?

42:42.858 --> 42:45.194
Joey, welcome.

43:25.442 --> 43:27.403
'You have to help me.'

43:48.465 --> 43:51.009
What a bitch.

43:51.093 --> 43:54.138
She was obviously just using you.

43:54.221 --> 43:57.683
- She was ready to dump you...
- No!

43:57.766 --> 43:59.810
She wouldn't.

43:59.893 --> 44:03.021
- Come on.
- I must have done something wrong.

44:04.982 --> 44:08.360
I tried, I just fucked up something...

44:08.443 --> 44:10.487
You didn't fuck it up with me!

44:10.571 --> 44:14.324
You know that and you know how sorry I am.

44:14.408 --> 44:18.871
I'm sorry to see you upset like this.
God, I hate to see you in pain.

44:18.954 --> 44:21.123
Really?

44:21.206 --> 44:23.750
Yes, I just want to hug you.

44:23.750 --> 44:26.378
I want to hold you, tell you it's all right.

44:29.464 --> 44:32.801
No, no, no, baby.
It's better that you come to me.

44:33.593 --> 44:36.054
It's not fair that I come there.

44:36.972 --> 44:38.682
On the bed.

44:39.683 --> 44:41.727
Come on over here.

44:43.228 --> 44:45.272
Come to Daddy.

44:57.325 --> 45:01.288
Come on... Come on...

45:04.916 --> 45:06.752
No, I can't.

45:16.678 --> 45:18.138
Bring her to me, boy.

45:19.014 --> 45:22.184
You're really making this hard on yourself.

45:29.024 --> 45:31.151
Watch your head on the steps.

45:47.292 --> 45:49.336
Wait!

45:50.670 --> 45:53.923
Why run, Terri? Why run?

45:55.467 --> 45:57.510
Do you know where you are?

45:57.594 --> 45:59.638
I'm...

46:01.556 --> 46:03.183
I'm...

46:03.266 --> 46:05.810
You are at the door to dreams, Terri.

46:07.145 --> 46:10.940
Now, there are two keys in this room.

46:11.024 --> 46:13.526
One is in the pocket of this fool.

46:13.610 --> 46:17.113
You could take it out without me reaching
you...

46:17.197 --> 46:19.240
probably,

46:19.324 --> 46:22.911
and let yourself back
into that world you've always known,

46:23.787 --> 46:27.123
banal, hopeless,

46:27.207 --> 46:29.042
dreamless.

46:30.835 --> 46:32.796
And the other?

46:32.879 --> 46:36.341
The other? Oh, Terri,

46:36.424 --> 46:39.469
the other is the key to dreams,

46:39.552 --> 46:43.139
to black miracles and dark wonders.

46:44.057 --> 46:47.852
Another life of unknown pleasures.

46:48.520 --> 46:50.355
And it's yours, Terri.

46:50.438 --> 46:53.983
Complete the pattern
and you solve the puzzle.

46:54.651 --> 46:56.694
Turn the key.

46:57.654 --> 46:59.489
Where is it?

46:59.572 --> 47:03.326
It's lying bleeding at your feet.

47:05.495 --> 47:09.666
Hell has no furies for a woman scorned.

47:39.570 --> 47:41.697
Terri, no!

49:22.423 --> 49:26.760
'Well, that was Tony Boyd and his band,
burning it up with an old number.

49:26.844 --> 49:30.181
'Now, as we in London
are ready to go to bed,

49:30.264 --> 49:32.182
'and Big Ben strikes midnight,

49:32.266 --> 49:36.812
'we'd like to send this final tune
out to all our lovely boys in the trenches.

49:36.896 --> 49:39.440
'Sleep well, chaps.'

50:44.922 --> 50:47.966
'Go to the window, Joey.

50:49.635 --> 50:51.887
'Go to the window.'

52:15.762 --> 52:17.806
Now what?

52:17.889 --> 52:19.933
I'm here.

52:21.226 --> 52:24.479
I just walked into madness for you.

52:25.563 --> 52:27.899
Talk.

52:30.068 --> 52:32.112
Talk!

53:01.099 --> 53:02.934
Joey, how kind of you to come.

53:09.023 --> 53:11.317
Wait. Wait!

53:53.159 --> 53:57.913
You have to help me.
I don't understand. Am I dreaming this?

53:58.664 --> 54:00.708
You'll have to help me.

54:00.791 --> 54:04.128
You will understand,
and, no, you're not dreaming.

54:07.506 --> 54:11.385
Forgive me.
My name was Spencer, Elliott Spencer.

54:11.469 --> 54:13.512
Captain.

54:13.596 --> 54:15.973
Joey Summerskill.

54:18.726 --> 54:21.187
Well done. Brave girl.

54:21.270 --> 54:25.357
You've probably never shaken hands
with a ghost before. Am I right?

54:25.441 --> 54:28.402
Captain Spencer, uh, Elliott...

54:28.486 --> 54:30.863
what the hell is going on?

54:30.946 --> 54:33.908
Hell is exactly what is going on, Joey,

54:33.991 --> 54:35.993
and we have to stop it.

54:36.619 --> 54:38.954
Will you walk with me a while?

54:40.414 --> 54:43.459
A dream of one war is a dream of all wars.

54:44.126 --> 54:47.338
Your dreams of finding your father
let me find you

54:47.421 --> 54:51.800
and bring you to this place,
this limbo between Heaven and Hell.

54:51.884 --> 54:56.263
I can't act in your world, Joey,
but you can.

54:56.347 --> 54:58.849
What do you want me to do?

54:58.933 --> 55:02.561
There is a monster out there, Joey,
and it's me.

55:03.761 --> 55:06.555
'The war destroyed my generation.

55:06.639 --> 55:09.892
'Those that didn't die
drank themselves to death.

55:09.975 --> 55:14.605
'I went further. I was an explorer
of forbidden pleasures,

55:14.688 --> 55:18.609
'opening the box my final act of exploration,

55:18.692 --> 55:21.195
'of discovery.'

55:34.458 --> 55:36.418
'I found the monster within the box.

55:36.502 --> 55:38.963
'It found the monster within me.'

55:39.046 --> 55:42.967
For decades, I served Hell
with no memory of my former life.

55:43.050 --> 55:47.262
- I still don't...
- Monster as I was, I was bound by laws.

55:47.346 --> 55:50.849
Hell has its commandments, too, you know.

55:50.933 --> 55:55.270
The box had to be opened to let me out.
The truly innocent were safe,

55:55.354 --> 55:57.982
until a friend released me.

55:58.065 --> 55:59.149
Kirsty Cotton.

56:07.658 --> 56:10.285
Yes, but if your soul was freed...

56:10.369 --> 56:12.913
My evil was too strong.

56:17.126 --> 56:19.169
'It hid,

56:19.253 --> 56:22.005
'it waited.'

56:26.593 --> 56:28.804
Well, no longer, Joey.

56:28.887 --> 56:31.515
The shell of the beast has been fleshed.

56:32.349 --> 56:37.396
What I was is out there in your world,

56:38.105 --> 56:40.148
unbound,

56:41.400 --> 56:43.443
unstoppable.

56:43.986 --> 56:46.989
- Then what can we do?
- There is something we can do

56:47.072 --> 56:49.116
but it will require great courage.

56:49.199 --> 56:53.537
- I don't know that I have...
- You just stepped through your window

56:53.620 --> 56:55.455
to another reality.

56:56.081 --> 56:58.792
You're stronger than you think.

56:58.875 --> 57:01.503
- Tell me what to do.
- There is a gateway to Hell

57:01.587 --> 57:03.630
through which he can be taken back.

57:03.714 --> 57:05.757
He wants to close that door forever.

57:05.841 --> 57:07.884
Where is it?

57:09.344 --> 57:11.763
Your apartment.

57:12.681 --> 57:15.767
It's the box, Joey. He has to destroy it.

57:15.851 --> 57:19.604
You must go back.
You must let him come for it.

57:19.688 --> 57:23.817
You found the window, Joey.
Use the box to bring him through it.

57:23.900 --> 57:29.364
Bring him here, to my dominion,
where I have power.

57:29.448 --> 57:33.201
- But what if he takes the box from me?
- He can't.

57:33.702 --> 57:35.746
It must be given to him

57:35.829 --> 57:38.707
and that's where your courage will count.

57:38.790 --> 57:40.834
Because, believe me,

57:40.917 --> 57:43.295
he can be very persuasive

57:44.337 --> 57:46.381
and very inventive.

59:10.924 --> 59:12.759
Shall we begin?

01:00:44.934 --> 01:00:47.645
'We're interrupting our programming

01:00:47.728 --> 01:00:50.606
'A catastrophe
has happened downtown.

01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:53.901
'We're outside The Boiler Room club,
downtown.

01:00:53.985 --> 01:00:58.572
'There are crowds all around us,
police all around. We have reports -

01:00:58.656 --> 01:01:01.242
'Excuse me - We've got reports

01:01:01.325 --> 01:01:04.912
'that a number have been
seriously injured, perhaps even killed.

01:01:04.996 --> 01:01:07.832
'There is, at this moment,
a body coming out.

01:01:07.915 --> 01:01:11.752
- 'It looks like a body from here.'
- 'Get off the sidewalk.'

01:01:11.836 --> 01:01:15.214
'Sorry,
we're just trying to get the information.

01:01:15.297 --> 01:01:17.299
'Somebody's been terribly hurt... '

01:01:20.344 --> 01:01:23.431
- Speak.
- Doc, Joey. Your TV on?

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:28.102
- Uh, what channel?
- Uh, 12, I think.

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:30.563
- And?
- 'I think I'll need some help.'

01:01:30.646 --> 01:01:33.941
'Can you meet me
at The Boiler Room club? '

01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:36.819
There's no one else I can call
and you said...

01:01:36.902 --> 01:01:39.613
In a minute. I'm closer.

01:01:39.697 --> 01:01:41.532
Find me there.

01:01:55.129 --> 01:01:58.924
- 'Can you tell us what the injuries are? '
- 'Not at this time.'

01:01:59.008 --> 01:02:03.220
'I can't be sure what,
but some kind of disaster's happening.

01:02:03.304 --> 01:02:06.557
'We've officers around us,
people are terribly upset.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:09.435
'We're not quite sure what's going on.

01:02:10.561 --> 01:02:13.981
'That's the latest we have,
a disaster at The Boiler Room.

01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:16.358
'We'll have the latest for you later... '

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:44.803
Doc?

01:04:49.156 --> 01:04:50.049
Oh, God...

01:05:01.210 --> 01:05:02.442
Doc!

01:06:30.712 --> 01:06:32.544
Doc, no!

01:06:37.668 --> 01:06:40.212
Oh, it's unbearable, isn't it?

01:06:40.296 --> 01:06:44.633
The suffering of strangers,
the agony of friends.

01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:50.765
There is a secret song
at the centre of the world, Joey,

01:06:50.848 --> 01:06:54.768
and its sound is like razors through flesh.

01:06:54.852 --> 01:06:56.687
I don't believe you.

01:06:56.770 --> 01:06:58.814
Oh, come.

01:06:58.898 --> 01:07:01.525
Oh, you can hear its faint echo right now.

01:07:03.027 --> 01:07:06.614
I'm here to turn up the volume,

01:07:07.781 --> 01:07:12.828
to press the stinking face of humanity into
the dark blood of its own secret heart.

01:07:12.912 --> 01:07:15.915
And I'm here to stop you
and send you back to Hell.

01:07:15.998 --> 01:07:19.627
Oh, no, you can't stop me, child,

01:07:19.710 --> 01:07:22.171
but you don't have to hear the music.

01:07:23.088 --> 01:07:27.426
Just give me the box
and I'll free you from the future.

01:07:27.509 --> 01:07:29.553
Free yourself from the past.

01:07:29.637 --> 01:07:31.680
Don't debate with me, girl!

01:07:31.764 --> 01:07:35.726
Just come here and die, while you still have
the option of doing it quickly!

01:07:36.435 --> 01:07:39.563
You're going to have to come and get me,
you ugly fuck!

01:07:40.773 --> 01:07:43.484
Oh, spirited.

01:07:44.818 --> 01:07:46.862
Oh, good.

01:07:46.945 --> 01:07:49.490
Oh, very good.

01:07:51.283 --> 01:07:53.827
Oh, I'll enjoy making you bleed

01:07:55.162 --> 01:07:58.749
and I'll enjoy making you enjoy it.

01:10:03.832 --> 01:10:05.709
Oh, Doc, no.

01:10:06.251 --> 01:10:10.422
Have you seen what he did to me,
you little bitch? Have you seen?

01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:24.310
Where are you going?

01:10:24.394 --> 01:10:26.354
- Run! Get out of here!
- Relax.

01:10:26.438 --> 01:10:28.356
Everything's cool.

01:10:29.441 --> 01:10:31.693
Whoa, what the fu...

01:10:36.614 --> 01:10:38.908
Ready for your close-up, Joey?

01:10:55.383 --> 01:10:57.427
No! Help!

01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:07.663
- Get the hell out of here!
- Just calm down...

01:12:07.747 --> 01:12:10.416
- Shit!
- No, listen to me. Listen.

01:12:11.501 --> 01:12:15.963
Freeze! I said, freeze!
Run!

01:12:16.047 --> 01:12:18.508
Calm down, please.

01:12:23.721 --> 01:12:25.264
Shit! Get back!

01:12:30.269 --> 01:12:32.688
Get down, lady!

01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:39.445
Shit! Gasoline!

01:12:43.032 --> 01:12:45.076
Run!

01:12:56.253 --> 01:12:57.880
That's a wrap.

01:13:34.834 --> 01:13:38.087
My child, what's the matter?
What on earth's the matter?

01:13:38.170 --> 01:13:41.423
I have to get him back to my apartment,
back to the window,

01:13:41.507 --> 01:13:44.385
but they just keep coming,
they just keep coming.

01:13:44.468 --> 01:13:47.888
- Who keeps coming?
- The demons. The demons.

01:13:47.972 --> 01:13:52.643
Demons? Demons aren't real.
They're parables, metaphors.

01:13:59.191 --> 01:14:01.277
Then what the fuck is that?

01:14:04.738 --> 01:14:06.782
Come on! Come on!

01:14:20.713 --> 01:14:22.381
How dare you?

01:14:22.464 --> 01:14:25.884
Thou shalt not bow down
before any graven image.

01:15:26.612 --> 01:15:29.489
I am the way.

01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:38.040
No!

01:15:40.625 --> 01:15:42.669
You'll burn in Hell for this!

01:15:45.255 --> 01:15:50.302
Burn. Of such a limited imagination.

01:15:58.643 --> 01:16:03.190
This is my body, this is my blood.

01:16:03.273 --> 01:16:06.902
Happy are they who come to my supper.

01:16:20.373 --> 01:16:23.835
Come on. Come on and get it.
This is what you want.

01:17:13.968 --> 01:17:16.137
I can dream now, Joey.

01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:20.558
Oh, you wouldn't believe
what I can dream of now.

01:17:22.352 --> 01:17:25.855
- Terri.
- Relax, baby.

01:17:25.939 --> 01:17:27.941
This is better than sex.

01:17:41.621 --> 01:17:43.706
Oh, yeah.

01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:45.625
Oh, yeah.

01:18:18.241 --> 01:18:20.910
They're hand-made, Joey.

01:18:20.994 --> 01:18:24.706
The shadow of my former troops,
over-eager.

01:18:24.789 --> 01:18:28.501
But let them play, hm?

01:18:28.584 --> 01:18:31.170
Our game will come later.

01:18:31.254 --> 01:18:37.718
Down the dark decades of your pain
this will seem like a memory of Heaven.

01:18:44.392 --> 01:18:49.564
Aaah. More friends
come to play with you, Joey.

01:18:56.571 --> 01:18:59.240
Play with this, Pinhead.

01:19:57.298 --> 01:19:59.383
Was that it, Elliott?

01:19:59.467 --> 01:20:01.886
I didn't bring him through my window.

01:20:03.512 --> 01:20:05.347
Elliott?

01:20:52.436 --> 01:20:54.021
Daddy?

01:20:54.104 --> 01:21:00.527
I don't understand. I was somewhere else,
somewhere shining.

01:21:00.611 --> 01:21:02.780
Somebody came to me and said,

01:21:02.863 --> 01:21:05.574
"Your daughter's done well. Go to her."

01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:09.995
- I don't understand.
- I do.

01:21:10.079 --> 01:21:12.998
I do. It's a reward. Oh, Daddy.

01:21:19.671 --> 01:21:22.174
Joey, Joey.

01:21:22.257 --> 01:21:25.052
- Is it you? Is it really you?
- Yes.

01:21:25.969 --> 01:21:28.680
Joey, they said you'd have
something for me.

01:21:28.764 --> 01:21:31.767
Something you won't need any more.

01:21:33.936 --> 01:21:36.313
This. Here, take it.

01:21:44.696 --> 01:21:47.824
How did you know my name?

01:21:51.912 --> 01:21:54.331
Thank you, Joey.

01:21:57.584 --> 01:22:01.255
Ha, ha, ha, ha. Human dreams.

01:22:01.338 --> 01:22:05.592
Such fertile ground
for sowing the seeds of torment.

01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:10.389
You're so ripe, Joey,
and it's harvest time.

01:22:10.472 --> 01:22:13.350
It isn't fair! You can't!

01:22:14.351 --> 01:22:16.561
Save your tears.

01:22:16.645 --> 01:22:19.272
I'll reap your sorrow, slowly.

01:22:20.315 --> 01:22:24.695
I have centuries to discover
the things that make you whimper.

01:22:28.490 --> 01:22:31.785
You bastard! You invaded my mind!

01:22:31.868 --> 01:22:35.163
You think your night-time world
is closed to me?

01:22:35.247 --> 01:22:38.125
Your mind is so naked.

01:22:38.208 --> 01:22:43.296
A book that yearns to be read,
a door that begs to be opened.

01:22:44.256 --> 01:22:46.842
A door. Window...

01:22:50.053 --> 01:22:52.097
Window.

01:23:01.064 --> 01:23:03.775
Couldn't resist playing games, could you?

01:23:05.694 --> 01:23:09.573
You had to come through
the window of her mind,

01:23:12.284 --> 01:23:14.327
but now you're in my dominion.

01:23:14.411 --> 01:23:17.372
And now...

01:23:17.455 --> 01:23:19.499
we're going to Hell.

01:23:19.583 --> 01:23:21.626
Ladies first.

01:23:28.967 --> 01:23:31.344
- No!
- You'll like her better this way.

01:23:31.428 --> 01:23:33.138
Trust me.

01:23:41.104 --> 01:23:44.816
Why resist? You love this as much as I.

01:23:45.483 --> 01:23:47.861
After all, you made me.

01:23:49.195 --> 01:23:52.574
There is a world out there
waiting to yield to us.

01:23:52.657 --> 01:23:57.829
So much flesh,
so many different pleasures.

01:24:44.292 --> 01:24:48.171
You're right. We do belong together.

01:25:49.315 --> 01:25:51.984
Now, where were we?

01:26:00.409 --> 01:26:03.329
Joey! Send me to Hell!

01:26:23.808 --> 01:26:25.476
Go to Hell!
