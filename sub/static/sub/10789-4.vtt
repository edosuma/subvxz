WEBVTT

00:04.500 --> 00:05.834
THIS IS ALL WRONG!

00:05.834 --> 00:08.834
THE ONLY WAY IT COULD BE
ANY WRONGER

00:08.834 --> 00:11.708
IS IF I PAID THEM
TO GET IT THIS WRONG
AND THEY BOTCHED IT UP!

00:11.708 --> 00:12.542
THERE'S A DVD PLAYER
IN THE LIVING ROOM!

00:12.542 --> 00:14.959
FUNNY, THAT...

00:14.959 --> 00:17.375
GIVEN AS THIS MOVIE'S
SUPPOSED TO BE SET
IN THE SEVENTIES!

00:17.375 --> 00:19.542
I TOOK CARE OF IT,
ALSO GOT RID OF THE CDs
AND THE LAPTOP.

00:19.542 --> 00:21.166
BLOODY IDIOTS!

00:21.166 --> 00:22.708
LIGHT?
SORRY, NO.

00:22.708 --> 00:24.834
WHAT'D YOU SAY
TO ME?

00:24.834 --> 00:26.500
YOUR GRANDFATHER
DIED OF LUNG CANCER.

00:26.500 --> 00:28.000
IT TOOK YOU
6 MONTHS TO QUIT.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.125
YOU TOLD ME UNDER
NO CIRCUMSTANCES
WAS I TO LET YOU SMOKE

00:29.125 --> 00:31.166
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
YOU BEGGED OR BRIBED.

00:31.166 --> 00:33.000
I WAS JUST KIDDING, MATE.
SORRY, CAN'T DO IT.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.875
I'LL GIVE YOU $12,000.
UH-UH.

00:34.875 --> 00:37.208
WANKER.

00:37.208 --> 00:39.500
THIS IS WHAT I GET
FOR SIGNING ON TO
THIS HILLBILLY CIRCUS.

00:39.500 --> 00:41.417
COULD HAVE BEEN
DIRECTING A MUSIC VIDEO
IN PARIS RIGHT NOW

00:41.417 --> 00:43.875
FOR ONE OF THOSE
HOMOSEXUAL CROONER BANDS,

00:43.875 --> 00:46.166
YOU KNOW, INSTEP
OR BACKDOOR BOYS
OR WHATEVER.

00:46.166 --> 00:48.875
BUT NO--I HAVE TO
CHOOSE MY ART.

00:48.875 --> 00:51.375
SO I REALLY
WANT TO GET IN CLOSE
ON NATASHA'S NIPPLES,

00:51.375 --> 00:53.750
SO STICK THE A/C
ON THEM, MAKE SURE
THEY REALLY POP, OK?

00:53.750 --> 00:55.708
CLASSY.
RIGHT.

00:55.708 --> 00:57.583
OH, AND YOU MAY
OR MAY NOT KNOW,

00:57.583 --> 00:59.458
BUT THE LOVELY NATASHA
CAN BE A BIT OF A--
HANDFUL.

00:59.458 --> 01:00.959
I WAS GONNA SAY
PAIN IN THE ASS,

01:00.959 --> 01:03.166
BUT OK.
SO LET'S KEEP HER
HAPPY.

01:03.166 --> 01:04.083
RIGHT.

01:04.083 --> 01:05.583
BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY.

01:05.583 --> 01:07.333
IT'S GONNA BE
A BIG NIGHT.

01:07.333 --> 01:08.708
IT'S AN IMPORTANT
SCENE...

01:08.708 --> 01:10.208
SO EVERYTHING
HAS TO GO PERFECTLY.

01:10.208 --> 01:13.667
RELAX. IT'S THE FIRST DAY.
PACE YOURSELF, MAN.
IT'S GONNA BE FUN.

01:13.667 --> 01:16.000
YEAH. YOUR IDEA OF FUN
IS MY PERSONAL HELL.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.583
RIGHT. SEND NATASHA
TO MY TRAILER.
IT'S TIME FOR

01:17.583 --> 01:21.458
"THE CRAZY DIVA ACTRESS
TELLS THE DIRECTOR HER
THOUGHTS ON THE SCENE

01:21.458 --> 01:23.792
SO WE CAN PRETEND
HER OPINION ACTUALLY
MATTERS" TALK.

01:23.792 --> 01:27.625
NATASHA'S NOT HERE
YET.

01:30.583 --> 01:32.583
YOU'RE TELLING ME
SHOOTING STARTS IN ONE HOUR,

01:32.583 --> 01:33.750
AND OUR LEAD ACTRESS--

01:33.750 --> 01:36.000
AT THE AIRPORT
BEING PICKED UP
BY PHIL THE P.A.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.708
NO, SHE ISN'T.
YES, SHE IS.

01:37.708 --> 01:38.875
NO. I FIRED PHIL THE P.A.
THIS AFTERNOON.

01:38.875 --> 01:42.708
WHY WOULD YOU FIRE
PHIL THE P.A.?

01:42.708 --> 01:45.458
BECAUSE PHIL THE P.A.
GETS ALL HUFFY WHEN PEOPLE
THROW CELL PHONES AT HIS HEAD

01:45.458 --> 01:47.000
FOR BUYING THE WRONG
KIND OF BATTERIES.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.667
YOU THREW A CELL PHONE
AT HIS HEAD?

01:48.667 --> 01:50.208
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
THE POINT IS...

01:50.208 --> 01:52.250
THAT OUR DECIDEDLY
DIFFICULT LEAD ACTRESS

01:52.250 --> 01:54.750
IS, AS WE SPEAK,
SITTING ON AN AIRPORT CURB

01:54.750 --> 01:56.834
WAITIN' FOR NO ONE!

01:56.834 --> 01:59.417
AND SHOOTING STARTS
IN 57 MINUTES!

01:59.417 --> 02:00.417
I'LL GET HER.

02:00.417 --> 02:02.667
GO!

02:02.667 --> 02:04.542
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO,
GO, GO!

03:09.041 --> 03:11.625
ISN'T THE PAPER ON THAT
DUE ON MONDAY?

03:11.625 --> 03:13.417
SHUT UP.

03:15.542 --> 03:17.000
OH, WOW. PAGE 109...

03:17.000 --> 03:20.083
YOU'D BETTER GET
CRACKING.

03:20.083 --> 03:21.625
OH, MY GOD.
WILL YOU PLEASE GO AWAY?

03:21.625 --> 03:24.125
SORRY.

03:24.125 --> 03:26.542
SO...WHAT DO YOU
THINK SO FAR?

03:26.542 --> 03:29.583
IF I TELL YOU,
WILL YOU LEAVE ME
ALONE?

03:29.583 --> 03:30.542
I THINK IT SUCKS.

03:30.542 --> 03:32.708
HUH.

03:32.708 --> 03:34.166
OH, WHAT, JUST BECAUSE

03:34.166 --> 03:37.166
EVERY QUASI-BOHEMIAN
HIPSTER WITH PRETENSIONS
OF LITERARY GREATNESS

03:37.166 --> 03:40.000
WORSHIPS AT THE ALTAR
OF KEROUAC, THAT MEANS
I SHOULD, TOO?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.667
NO.

03:41.667 --> 03:43.750
IT'S JUST BORING.
AND IT MEANDERS.

03:43.750 --> 03:46.250
AND THERE'S NO STORY.
IT'S JUST ONE LONG
RUN-ON SENTENCE.

03:46.250 --> 03:49.417
IT'S ALL MACHO POSTURING
AND MISOGYNY.

03:50.625 --> 03:52.583
HMM.

03:53.750 --> 03:55.792
EXCUSE ME?

03:55.792 --> 03:56.542
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

03:56.542 --> 03:58.458
YES, YOU DID.
YOU SAID HMM.
DID I?

03:58.458 --> 04:01.708
YES, YOU DID.
IN A VERY LOADED WAY,
I MIGHT ADD.

04:01.708 --> 04:04.875
WELL, IT'S NOTHING.
I JUST...I'M LEARNING
ABOUT YOU.

04:04.875 --> 04:06.667
AND WHAT THE HELL
DOES THAT MEAN?

04:06.667 --> 04:07.375
NOTHING. CHILL.

04:07.375 --> 04:09.333
JUST BECAUSE
I DON'T LIKE A BOOK

04:09.333 --> 04:11.000
MEANS I'M DEFICIENT
IN SOME WAY?

04:11.000 --> 04:13.458
NO, NO. I JUST THOUGHT
THAT YOUR OPINION
WAS INTERESTING.

04:13.458 --> 04:14.250
LOOK, I DON'T NEED YOU
TO PATRONIZE ME.

04:14.250 --> 04:17.250
OH, MY GOD.
WHY ARE YOU SO ANGRY?

04:17.250 --> 04:18.750
I'M NOT ANGRY!
YES, YOU ARE.

04:18.750 --> 04:19.791
NO. I'M ANGRY
AT NO ONE.

04:19.791 --> 04:21.000
I DIDN'T SAY YOU WERE
ANGRY AT SOMEONE.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.417
I JUST SAID
YOU WERE ANGRY.

04:23.417 --> 04:25.417
WELL, I'M NOT.

04:25.417 --> 04:27.583
IS IT A GUY?

04:27.583 --> 04:29.792
IS--IS IT A GUY?
ARE YOU ANGRY
AT A GUY?

04:29.792 --> 04:31.250
OH, RIGHT.

04:31.250 --> 04:33.291
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
IT ALWAYS  IS, ISN'T IT?

04:33.291 --> 04:36.333
I DON'T LIKE YOU,
THEREFORE, IT MUST  BE

04:36.333 --> 04:37.417
BECAUSE SOME GUY
BROKE MY HEART.

04:37.417 --> 04:40.917
IT JUST CAN'T BE BECAUSE
YOU'RE OBJECTIONAL
IN ANY WAY.

04:40.917 --> 04:42.875
REALLY?
YOU DON'T LIKE ME?

04:42.875 --> 04:44.750
YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:44.750 --> 04:46.708
I NEED TO GET BACK
TO WORK,

04:46.708 --> 04:48.750
SO CAN YOU PLEASE
STOP TALKING TO ME?

04:48.750 --> 04:51.208
WOW.

04:51.208 --> 04:54.125
WHOEVER THIS GUY WAS,
HE REALLY MUST HAVE
DONE A NUMBER ON YOU.

04:54.125 --> 04:55.708
YOU KNOW WHAT, EDDIE?
YOU'VE NOW CROSSED--

04:55.708 --> 04:57.125
(TELEPHONE RINGS)
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

04:57.125 --> 04:59.500
AHEM.
HELL'S KITCHEN.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.959
YEAH, WE DO DELIVERIES.

05:00.959 --> 05:02.625
YEAH, WELL, YEAH...

05:02.625 --> 05:06.667
THAT'S, UH...
THAT'S A PRETTY BIG
ORDER. LET ME CHECK.

05:06.667 --> 05:08.000
ALL RIGHT.

05:12.125 --> 05:13.583
(TELEPHONE RINGS)

05:17.125 --> 05:18.417
AUDREY.

05:18.417 --> 05:19.750
HOW DID YOU KNOW
IT WAS ME?

05:19.750 --> 05:22.417
WELL, I'M PSYCHOTIC.
YOU'RE LATE.

05:22.417 --> 05:25.458
YEAH, I KNOW. LOOK...
I DON'T THINK
I'M GONNA MAKE IT.

05:25.458 --> 05:30.166
NO! NO, NO, NO, NO.
PACEY, YOU CANNOT
BAIL OUT ON ME!

05:30.166 --> 05:32.625
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN DAYS--LIKE

05:32.625 --> 05:36.500
PLUS, WE HAVE

05:36.500 --> 05:38.834
AND THE FESTIVITIES
HAVE ALREADY BEGUN
OVER HERE,

05:38.834 --> 05:41.333
SO YOU BETTER
GET YOUR BUTT
IN GEAR PRONTO,

05:41.333 --> 05:43.166
AND I DON'T WANNA HEAR
ANY OF YOUR LAME
EXCUSES.

05:43.166 --> 05:44.583
I GOTTA STUDY.

05:44.583 --> 05:48.750
NO, PACEY,
YOU GOTTA BE WITH YOUR
GIRLFRIEND TONIGHT.

05:48.750 --> 05:50.875
I'M BEGINNING TO FORGET
WHAT SEX IS LIKE.

05:50.875 --> 05:53.625
I MAY BE FORCED
TO SHAG A STRANGER
TO REMEMBER.

05:55.750 --> 05:57.000
OK, LOOK,

05:57.000 --> 05:58.792
TOMORROW NIGHT...

05:58.792 --> 06:02.083
I PROMISE YOU AN ALL-NIGHT
WITTER-LIDDELL SHAG FEST

06:02.083 --> 06:03.333

06:25.291 --> 06:27.208
DULY NOTED.

ALL RIGHT.

06:28.458 --> 06:30.458
YOU'RE ABSOLVED.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.375
GO BE STUDIOUS

06:49.041 --> 06:51.041
YOU CAN'T GO HOME!
TONIGHT IS ONLY LIKE

06:51.041 --> 06:52.208
THE BIGGEST AND BEST

06:52.208 --> 06:55.458

07:12.750 --> 07:15.750
I HAVE EARNED THIS NIGHT

07:35.041 --> 07:36.834
WE ARE GOING TO SCREAM

07:36.834 --> 07:38.500
IN SHORT, WE'RE GONNA

07:52.792 --> 07:55.125
I TOTALLY DON'T MIND
SITTING HERE WAITING
FOR AN HOUR.

07:55.125 --> 07:56.708
MY ASS IS NOT
THE LEAST BIT NUMB.

08:08.834 --> 08:11.458
(EXHALES)

08:13.500 --> 08:14.875
SO...

08:14.875 --> 08:15.542

08:34.375 --> 08:35.500
THAT OTHER ACTOR...

08:35.500 --> 08:37.375
HE'S NOT REALLY
GONNA STRANGLE ME,
DAWSON.

08:37.375 --> 08:40.207
IT'S...
IT'S JUST PRETEND.

08:43.375 --> 08:44.708
ARE YOU...DRINKING?

08:46.125 --> 08:46.834
YOU'RE SMART.

08:46.834 --> 08:47.667
DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU SHOULD--

08:47.667 --> 08:50.333
I'M FINE. STOP OFF
IF YOU SEE A FLORIST.

08:50.333 --> 08:53.333
I WANT TO GET TODD
SOME LILIES.

08:53.333 --> 08:54.834
I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ONE ON THE WAY.

08:54.834 --> 08:56.500
RIGHT THERE, RIGHT THERE!
PULL OVER.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.959
WE'RE REALLY LATE--

08:57.959 --> 08:59.917
YOU WANNA GET ME MAD?

08:59.917 --> 09:01.708
'CAUSE IF I SHOW UP
ON SET MAD...

09:10.667 --> 09:12.667
COME ON. WE'RE GONNA

09:12.667 --> 09:14.291

09:14.291 --> 09:16.041
I CAN'T DO IT, MAN.
I GOTTA STUDY.

09:16.041 --> 09:18.500
SORRY. DID I SAY THAT
LIKE IT WAS A QUESTION?

09:18.500 --> 09:20.375
WHAT?

09:20.375 --> 09:21.583
WE'RE GONNA HIT
SOME CLUBS. YOU'RE
COMIN' WITH. LET'S GO.

09:21.583 --> 09:24.458
NO. I'M SERIOUS.
I REALLY GOTTA STUDY.

09:24.458 --> 09:26.000
DO YOU SEE THOSE GUYS?

09:26.000 --> 09:28.250
DO YOU NOTICE
THAT NOT ONE OF THEM

09:28.250 --> 09:29.792
WORKS OUT HERE
WITH YOU GRUNTS?

09:29.792 --> 09:31.875
THAT'S BECAUSE
THEY'RE YOUR BOSSES.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.708
NOT YOUR CO-WORKERS,
NOT YOUR COLLEAGUES.

09:33.708 --> 09:36.417
THEY HOLD THE FUTURE
OF YOUR CAREER
IN THEIR HANDS,

09:36.417 --> 09:38.333
SO THINK HARD, PACEY,
BEFORE YOU SAY NO.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.417
WELL, I SHOULD CALL
MY GIRLFRIEND.

09:42.417 --> 09:45.792
THAT'S ADORABLE.
DO IT LATER.

09:45.792 --> 09:47.208
GRAB YOUR COAT.
LET'S GO.

09:47.208 --> 09:48.708
READY, GENTLEMEN.

09:53.583 --> 09:56.333
Natasha: OH, MY GOD!
LOOK AT ALL THE LIGHTS!

09:56.333 --> 09:58.041
HOW MUCH DID YOU
ACTUALLY DRINK?

09:58.041 --> 10:01.166
OH, DONALD.
DON'T BE SUCH
A SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS.

10:01.166 --> 10:02.667
I ONLY HAD A LITTLE NIP.

10:02.667 --> 10:04.250
WHY DO YOU KEEP
CALLING ME DONALD?

10:04.250 --> 10:06.792
WELL, I THINK WE CAN
BOTH AGREE DAWSON'S
A STUPID NAME.

10:06.792 --> 10:09.041
PLUS, YOU
LOOK LIKE A DONALD.
OR IF YOU PREFER--RONALD.

10:09.041 --> 10:11.959
TODD!

10:11.959 --> 10:14.083
WELCOME TO BOSTON!
YOU'RE RADIANT, DARLING!

10:14.083 --> 10:15.834
YOU'RE LATE!

10:15.834 --> 10:17.750
DONALD GOT LOST.

10:17.750 --> 10:18.417
THEY'RE LOVELY.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.250
ARE YOU READY
FOR THE SCENE?

10:20.250 --> 10:21.917
GOT IT ALL UP HERE!

10:21.917 --> 10:24.041
GREAT. WE'RE RUNNING
A WEE BIT BEHIND SCHEDULE,

10:24.041 --> 10:25.917
SO WHY DON'T YOU
POP OFF TO WARDROBE?

10:25.917 --> 10:27.667
SURE!
WRONG WAY, LOVE.

10:27.667 --> 10:29.125
RIGHT.

10:29.125 --> 10:32.166
WHAT THE HELL'S
WRONG WITH HER?
SHE'S TIRED.

10:32.166 --> 10:34.417
WELL, GET HER TO WARDROBE
AND GET HER SOME COFFEE!

10:34.417 --> 10:35.583
RIGHT.

10:40.583 --> 10:42.708
STOP PAWING AT ME,
BUSY HANDS!

10:42.708 --> 10:45.208
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I ACTUALLY LET THOSE
HANDS TOUCH ME NAKED!

10:45.208 --> 10:46.333
THANK GOD NOBODY HERE
KNOWS I ACTUALLY DATED YOU!

10:46.333 --> 10:48.792
NATASHA, LISTEN--

10:48.792 --> 10:51.291
SO HOW'S THAT OLD FRIEND
YOU DUMPED ME FOR
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO?

10:51.291 --> 10:53.959
DIDN'T QUITE
CATCH HER NAME.
WAIT, IT IS A GIRL, ISN'T IT?

10:53.959 --> 10:55.000
SHE'S FINE.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
DON'T TELL ME
SHE DUMPED YOU ALREADY.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.792
THAT IS...SO SAD.

11:00.792 --> 11:02.083
NATASHA, LISTEN,

11:02.083 --> 11:03.750
I'M SORRY...
ABOUT WHAT I DID TO YOU.

11:03.750 --> 11:04.542
I DON'T BLAME YOU
IF YOU HATE ME.

11:04.542 --> 11:08.250
I DON'T HATE YOU.
I PITY YOU.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.417
WELL, LET ME HELP YOU.
HOW 'BOUT I GET YOU
COFFEE

11:10.417 --> 11:11.708
OR A BAGEL OR SOMETHING?

11:11.708 --> 11:14.000
YOU WANNA HELP ME?
YOU WANNA HELP ME.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.166
THAT IS SO  SWEET!

11:16.166 --> 11:18.667
OK...I'LL TELL YOU
HOW YOU CAN HELP ME.

11:18.667 --> 11:20.041
GO TO HELL, DAWSON!

11:29.291 --> 11:30.500
(SOBBING) NO!

11:30.500 --> 11:34.250
PLEASE, SOMEBODY,
HELP ME!

11:34.250 --> 11:35.375
NO! SOMEBODY
PLEASE HELP ME!

11:35.375 --> 11:38.792
SOMEBODY PLEASE
HELP ME! NO!

11:38.792 --> 11:40.125
(CHOKING) AARRRHHH...

11:40.125 --> 11:42.500
HA HA HA HA HA!

11:44.667 --> 11:46.750
I'M GONNA PEE
IN MY PANTS!

11:46.750 --> 11:48.333
Todd:

11:48.333 --> 11:50.625
I--I'M SORRY, TODD.

11:50.625 --> 11:52.375
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, LOVE.
GO AGAIN.

11:52.375 --> 11:55.041
THIS TIME,
REMEMBER...

11:55.041 --> 11:56.083
TERROR.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.041
UH-HUH.

12:02.542 --> 12:03.417
NO! NO!

12:03.417 --> 12:05.542
PLEASE...

12:05.542 --> 12:07.208
SOMEBODY HELP ME--

12:07.208 --> 12:08.166

12:08.166 --> 12:10.250
OW, MY BOOBS!

12:10.250 --> 12:10.917

(NATASHA LAUGHING)

12:12.458 --> 12:14.875
NO...NO, PLEASE!

12:14.875 --> 12:15.834
NO! NO. GOD--

12:15.834 --> 12:17.041
Actor: OW!
Natasha: OH!

12:17.041 --> 12:18.208
OH, I GOT YOU
IN THE WHOO-HOO!

12:18.208 --> 12:20.834
TODD!

12:20.834 --> 12:22.959
I CAN'T WORK
LIKE THIS!

12:22.959 --> 12:24.750
CUT.

12:32.333 --> 12:34.041
IS SHE DRUNK?

12:34.041 --> 12:36.250
NO.

12:36.250 --> 12:37.583
DAWSON?
MAYBE A LITTLE.

12:47.667 --> 12:51.250
I MUST ADMIT,
I AM IMPRESSED, WITTER.

12:51.250 --> 12:52.417
WITH WHAT, EXACTLY?

12:52.417 --> 12:55.583
FULLY 3 HOT WOMEN
TRIED TO HIT ON YOU
IN THAT LAST CLUB,

12:55.583 --> 12:57.291
AND YOU TURNED DOWN
EVERY ONE.

12:57.291 --> 12:59.083
I DON'T THINK I COULD BE
THAT FAITHFUL
TO ANY GIRL.

12:59.083 --> 13:00.667
I DON'T CARE
HOW HOT SHE IS.

13:00.667 --> 13:02.667
YOU'RE A BETTER MAN
THAN I.

13:02.667 --> 13:06.250
YOU'RE RIGHT,
BUT I THINK THAT ONE OF
THOSE GIRLS WAS A GUY.

13:06.250 --> 13:08.208
YEAH, BUT I THOUGHT
THAT WAS YOUR THING.

13:08.208 --> 13:10.667
(AUDREY LAUGHING)

13:10.667 --> 13:12.166
OK, SO...WHERE THE HELL
ARE WE GOING AGAIN?

13:12.166 --> 13:13.333
HOUSE PARTY.

13:13.333 --> 13:15.625
RIGHT. RIGHT.

13:15.625 --> 13:17.250
AND...WHERE EXACTLY
IS THAT?

13:17.250 --> 13:18.291
YOU DON'T KNOW?

13:18.291 --> 13:19.542
I DON'T KNOW.

13:19.542 --> 13:20.667
I CERTAINLY
DON'T KNOW.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.834
WELL, IT'S SOMEWHERE
IN BOSTON.

13:22.834 --> 13:25.959
OH, YEAH. YEAH, THAT HELPS.

13:25.959 --> 13:26.834
NICE!

13:26.834 --> 13:28.959
OH, YOU GUYS, YOU GUYS,
I JUST REMEMBERED!

13:28.959 --> 13:30.500
IT'S DOWN ON WAVERLY ROAD
NEXT TO THAT GIANT
SUPERMARKET

13:30.500 --> 13:32.834
THAT HAS THE FREE AISLE!

13:32.834 --> 13:33.625
COOL. LET'S GO.
I'M COLD!

13:33.625 --> 13:35.792
AUDREY, WHAT'S A FREE AISLE?

13:35.792 --> 13:37.959
THE AISLE WITH
THE LITTLE PLASTIC BINS

13:37.959 --> 13:40.875
FILLED WITH THE FOOD
THAT YOU CAN SNACK ON
WHILE YOU SHOP.

13:40.875 --> 13:42.542
NO. THOSE ARE
BULK BINS.

13:42.542 --> 13:44.792
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
PUT THE FOOD IN LITTLE
PLASTIC BAGGIES

13:44.792 --> 13:46.291
AND THEN PAY FOR IT.
REALLY?

13:46.291 --> 13:50.333
HEY, WHO'S UP FOR
GOING TO THAT STRIP
CLUB IN WALTHAM?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.959
OH, MY GOD.

13:56.959 --> 13:59.083
OK, AUDREY, I TRIED
TO CALL YOU FROM WO--

13:59.083 --> 13:59.959
DON'T TOUCH ME.

13:59.959 --> 14:01.917
CAN WE JUST
DISCUSS THIS
CALMLY, PLEASE?

14:01.917 --> 14:04.458
WHAT DISCUSS?
THERE'S NOTHING
TO DISCUSS.

14:04.458 --> 14:05.542
YOU LIED.
I DIDN'T LIE.

14:05.542 --> 14:08.542
I WAS STUDYING,
AND THEN THIS WORK THING
JUST CAME UP.

14:08.542 --> 14:10.708
SINCE WHEN DOES A BUNCH
OF JERKS IN SUITS

14:10.708 --> 14:12.166
STUFFING DOLLARS
DOWN A G-STRING
COUNT AS WORK?

14:15.125 --> 14:16.041
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY
UNDERSTAND

14:16.041 --> 14:18.834
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS
THAT THESE MEN INVITED ME

14:18.834 --> 14:20.000
TO COME OUT WITH THEM.
I COULDN'T SAY NO.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.166
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO YOU ARE ANYMORE,
PACEY.

14:23.166 --> 14:26.667
YOU'RE LIKE SOME
SMARMY STOCKBROKER GUY.

14:26.667 --> 14:28.834
ALL YOU CARE ABOUT
IS YOUR STUPID JOB.

14:28.834 --> 14:31.667
BECAUSE...

14:31.667 --> 14:34.458
I DON'T WANNA
LIVE OFF MAC AND CHEESE
AND RAMEN NOODLES

14:34.458 --> 14:36.041
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,
AND THAT'S HOW IT WILL
BE FOR ME

14:36.041 --> 14:39.875
IF I DON'T BUST MY ASS
AND PLAY BY THEIR RULES.

14:39.875 --> 14:42.917
I WISH THAT I COULD
CONTINUE IGNORING REALITY,
BUT I CAN'T,

14:42.917 --> 14:46.375
BECAUSE WE DON'T ALL LIVE
IN AUDREY LAND.

14:46.375 --> 14:48.041
RIGHT.

14:48.041 --> 14:50.792
AND I'M JUST SOME
DUMB, RICH AIRHEAD
WHO DOESN'T GET IT.

14:50.792 --> 14:52.583
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M SAYING.

14:52.583 --> 14:55.708
ACTUALLY,
I THINK IT'S EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

14:55.708 --> 14:57.458
THEN I'M SORRY...OK?

14:57.458 --> 15:00.375
I'M SORRY.
IT'S JUST THAT
THIS JOB IS IMPORTANT TO ME,

15:00.375 --> 15:01.708
AND I LIKE IT
AND I'M GOOD AT IT,

15:01.708 --> 15:04.625
AND HONESTLY,
I WISH YOU COULD BE A LITTLE
BIT MORE UNDERSTANDING.

15:06.667 --> 15:09.417
I THINK I UNDERSTAND
PERFECTLY.

15:09.417 --> 15:11.041
AND I HOPE YOU HAVE
FUN, PACEY.

15:11.041 --> 15:11.542
COME ON, YOU GUYS.
LET'S GO.

15:11.542 --> 15:13.834
AUDREY, COME ON!

15:13.834 --> 15:14.166
DON'T FOLLOW ME!

15:19.583 --> 15:22.125
SHAKE IT OFF, MAN.

15:38.208 --> 15:40.625
BIG DELIVERY, HUH?

15:43.417 --> 15:45.917
A LOTTA FOOD.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.250
SO...HOW'S
ON THE ROAD?

15:50.250 --> 15:50.750
FINE.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.166
WHAT PAGE
ARE YOU ON?

15:54.750 --> 15:56.667
CAN WE NOT TALK?
DO YOU MIND?

15:58.125 --> 15:59.291
ALL RIGHT.

15:59.291 --> 16:02.750
BUT I THINK I FIGURED OUT
WHY YOU HATE IT SO MUCH.

16:02.750 --> 16:04.125
JOY.

16:04.125 --> 16:05.417
YEAH, I WAS THINKING,

16:05.417 --> 16:08.792
HOW COULD ANYBODY
IN THEIR RIGHT MIND HATE
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL BOOK?

16:08.792 --> 16:10.708
AND THEN I REALIZED...

16:10.708 --> 16:12.583
IT'S BECAUSE
IT MAKES YOU NERVOUS.

16:12.583 --> 16:13.667
REALLY?

16:13.667 --> 16:14.875
YEAH. YEAH,
'CAUSE IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE

16:14.875 --> 16:17.208
WHO DON'T FOLLOW
THE DOMINANT PATH.

16:17.208 --> 16:20.583
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WHO KINDA
JUST LIVE ON THEIR IMPULSES,

16:20.583 --> 16:22.458
AND THAT MAKES A LOT
OF PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE.

16:22.458 --> 16:25.750
BORING PEOPLE?
PEOPLE WHO DON'T FOLLOW
THEIR IMPULSES?

16:25.750 --> 16:28.250
I DIDN'T SAY BORING,
JUST, UH...

16:28.250 --> 16:29.708
SAFE.

16:30.875 --> 16:33.917
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME.

16:35.375 --> 16:38.250
EXCEPT FOR THE WAY
PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT BOOKS

16:38.250 --> 16:39.291
OR MOVIES OR MUSIC.
IT SAYS A LOT.

16:39.291 --> 16:42.542
I'LL LET YOU KNOW
I FOLLOW PLENTY
OF MY IMPULSES.

16:42.542 --> 16:44.959
IN FACT, THIS SUMMER
ON A WHIM, WITH ALMOST
NO MONEY TO MY NAME,

16:44.959 --> 16:46.708
I BOUGHT A TICKET TO PARIS.

16:46.708 --> 16:48.000
REALLY?
YOU WENT TO PARIS.
HOW WAS IT?

16:48.000 --> 16:50.667
WELL, NO, I--

16:50.667 --> 16:54.291
THE POINT IS
IS THAT I COULD HAVE GONE.

16:54.291 --> 16:55.000
SO YOU DIDN'T GO.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.375
NO. BUT THE POINT IS
I COULD HAVE.

16:57.375 --> 17:00.667
OH. AND HERE I THOUGHT
LIFE WAS ABOUT
THE THINGS YOU DO,

17:00.667 --> 17:03.834
NOT THE THINGS
YOU COULD HAVE DONE.
THAT'S MY MISTAKE.

17:06.750 --> 17:09.791
HO. WHERE YOU GOING?

17:09.791 --> 17:11.541
UH, BACK TO WORK.
THAT'S ALL OF IT.

17:11.541 --> 17:13.208
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE
COMIN' WITH ME.
NO, I'M NOT.

17:13.208 --> 17:15.750
HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO GET ALL THE FOOD
OUT OF THIS CAR?

17:15.750 --> 17:16.834
WENDY CAN GO WITH YOU.

17:16.834 --> 17:18.541
NO. WENDY IS IN THE BAR

17:18.541 --> 17:20.666
COVERING FOR ME,
WHICH YOU'RE NOT
QUALIFIED TO DO.

17:20.666 --> 17:23.165
SORRY. LET'S GO.

17:25.375 --> 17:28.165
Audrey: I MEAN,
IT'S BAD ENOUGH
THAT HE LIED,

17:28.165 --> 17:31.250
BUT THE FACT THAT HE
WOULD RATHER HANG OUT
WITH THOSE GUYS

17:31.250 --> 17:33.291
THAN WITH ME, I MEAN...

17:34.875 --> 17:36.875
OH, MY GOD.
I AM SORRY, YOU GUYS.

17:36.875 --> 17:37.708
DO I KEEP TALKING
ABOUT THIS?

17:37.708 --> 17:40.166
NO, IT'S FINE.
IT'S FINE.

17:40.166 --> 17:41.458
JUST A LITTLE BIT.

17:41.458 --> 17:43.166
SORRY! I FORGOT
ABOUT OUR PACT.

17:43.166 --> 17:43.542
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
HAVING FUN.

17:43.542 --> 17:45.583
IT'S FINE.

17:45.583 --> 17:46.583
(EXHALES)

17:46.583 --> 17:49.208
IT'S JUST...

17:49.208 --> 17:50.417
YOU KNOW.

17:50.417 --> 17:53.875
YOU USED TO MAKE FUN
OF GUYS LIKE THAT,
YOU KNOW?

17:53.875 --> 17:55.917
HE NEVER WANTS TO HAVE
SEX ANYMORE.

17:55.917 --> 17:58.000
WE'RE LITERALLY DOWN
TO 3 TIMES A WEEK.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.291
OH, GOSH, UM,

17:59.291 --> 18:00.583
I NEED A BEER.

18:00.583 --> 18:02.583
BE RIGHT BACK.

18:02.583 --> 18:04.417
OK.

18:12.083 --> 18:14.083
CAN I GET A BEER?

18:15.000 --> 18:17.083
THANK YOU.

18:17.083 --> 18:20.834
OH! OH, MY GOD!
LOOK WHAT I DID!

18:20.834 --> 18:23.792
THAT'S OK.
IT WAS MY FAULT.

18:23.792 --> 18:25.750
OH, NO, JEEZ,
YOU DON'T EVEN--

18:25.750 --> 18:27.500
YOU'RE--YOU DON'T
EVEN DRINK,

18:27.500 --> 18:30.083
AND I'M SURE
IT'S COLD AND SMELLY

18:30.083 --> 18:33.458
AND I'M TOUCHING YOU,
AND I'M GONNA STOP.

18:35.625 --> 18:37.041
HI.

18:37.792 --> 18:39.917
OK. YOU CAUGHT ME.

18:39.917 --> 18:42.417
I'M DRUNK.

18:42.417 --> 18:44.125
YEP, I'M A DRUNKARD,

18:44.125 --> 18:46.333
ESCAPING REALITY.
THAT'S ME.

18:46.333 --> 18:47.875
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS A PARTY,

18:47.875 --> 18:50.834
AND AT PARTIES,
PEOPLE DRINK,

18:50.834 --> 18:52.417
AND MAYBE
THAT BOTHERS YOU,

18:52.417 --> 18:53.125
MAYBE YOU THINK
IT'S WEAK,

18:53.125 --> 18:55.959
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T
GO TO A PARTY

18:55.959 --> 18:57.792
WHERE THERE'S GONNA
BE DRUNK PEOPLE,

18:57.792 --> 18:59.250
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
AT A PARTY.

18:59.250 --> 19:00.708
THERE'S DRINKING.
IT'S JUST A PARTY FACT.

19:00.708 --> 19:03.250
YOU THINK I'M THE LAMEST,
MOST SQUARE PERSON
ON THE EARTH, DON'T YOU?

19:03.250 --> 19:06.875
NO! NO, NOT AT ALL.
I'M SURE YOU'RE,
LIKE...

19:06.875 --> 19:08.125
TONS OF FUN.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.208
I'M GONNA GO.

19:13.208 --> 19:16.125
IT'S NOT LIKE
I DON'T HAVE A PHONE,
YOU KNOW?

19:16.125 --> 19:18.625
IT'S RIGHT HERE
IN MY PURSE
WITH ME AT ALL TIMES,

19:18.625 --> 19:20.708
BUT HAS HE EVEN
TRIED TO CALL ME? NO.

19:20.708 --> 19:22.500
Jack:
OH, MY GOD! UH...AHEM.

19:22.500 --> 19:23.959
YEAH. UH--

19:23.959 --> 19:25.667

A FAMILIAR FACE.

19:32.792 --> 19:34.708
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HERE? MY GOD...

19:34.708 --> 19:36.834
I MEAN, NOT THAT
I'M NOT GLAD
TO SEE YOU.

19:36.834 --> 19:39.875
I THINK IT'S COOL
THAT YOU SHOWED UP,
BUT I DIDN'T EXPECT--

19:39.875 --> 19:42.625
SEEING AS I TEACH
WHAT'S GENERALLY
CONSIDERED TO BE

19:42.625 --> 19:44.542
A COOL, NON-STODGY TOPIC,

19:44.542 --> 19:48.125
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,
A STUDENT SEES FIT
TO EXTEND AN INVITATION.

19:48.125 --> 19:51.959
USUALLY IN JEST, I'M SURE.
NEVER THINKING
I'D ACTUALLY SHOW UP.

19:51.959 --> 19:54.000
HEY, AS LONG AS
YOU'RE HERE, WHY
DON'T WE GET A BEER?

19:54.000 --> 19:55.500
SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.
COOL.

20:16.750 --> 20:19.208
ARE WE DELIVERING THE FOOD
TO A MOVIE SET
BY ANY CHANCE?

20:19.208 --> 20:23.291
YEAH. IT'S SOME
SLASHER MOVIE,
I THINK.

20:23.291 --> 20:24.375

21:05.917 --> 21:10.166

21:12.542 --> 21:15.583

CAPABLE

21:15.583 --> 21:18.583

21:18.583 --> 21:19.542
Jen: OH, MY GOD!

21:19.542 --> 21:22.917
HA HA HA!

DROWNED YOUR PHONE!

21:22.917 --> 21:26.125

DROWNED IT!

21:30.750 --> 21:33.083
HEY...(LAUGHING)

21:33.083 --> 21:34.625
SLOW DOWN.

21:34.625 --> 21:37.458
AUDREY, SERIOUSLY.

21:37.458 --> 21:39.333
OK.

21:39.333 --> 21:39.959
WHOSE TURN IS IT?

21:39.959 --> 21:42.583
(DROPPING COINS)

21:42.583 --> 21:43.375
Audrey:
DID YOU DO THAT?

21:43.375 --> 21:46.333
YOU THINK THEY CAN
FIX THAT? HA HA HA!

21:46.333 --> 21:47.667
WANNA GO NOW?
NO.

21:47.667 --> 21:48.375
WHY NOT?

21:48.375 --> 21:51.083
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO
BE PAID FIRST.

21:51.083 --> 21:52.333
FINE.

21:54.542 --> 21:55.125
EXCUSE ME.

21:55.125 --> 21:57.625
HI. WE BROUGHT
THE FOOD.

21:57.625 --> 21:58.250
OH, AWESOME!
I'M STARVING.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.375
ACTUALLY,
I WAS WONDERING...

22:00.375 --> 22:02.708
WHERE DO WE
GET PAID?

22:02.708 --> 22:05.000
OH, TALK TO DAWSON.
HE IS... RIGHT...

22:05.000 --> 22:06.500

22:07.750 --> 22:09.708

22:20.542 --> 22:21.542
HEY.

22:21.542 --> 22:22.125
HEY.

22:22.125 --> 22:25.834
WHAT ARE YOU DOING

22:25.834 --> 22:27.750
NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO.

22:27.750 --> 22:30.250
OH, I'M JUST SURPRISED
IS ALL.

22:31.083 --> 22:34.333
I WAS...
DELIVERING SOME FOOD,

22:34.333 --> 22:37.166
AND I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS HERE
UNTIL WE GOT HERE.

22:37.166 --> 22:40.000
BELIEVE ME,
HAD I KNOWN,
I WOULDN'T HAVE--

22:40.000 --> 22:42.333
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

22:42.333 --> 22:43.834
IT'S OK.

22:43.834 --> 22:46.875
I WASN'T EXACTLY
APOLOGIZING.
NO, WHY WOULD YOU?

22:46.875 --> 22:49.041
WHAT DOES THAT  MEAN?
Natasha: DAWSON,
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

22:49.041 --> 22:52.500
GRAB A BITE QUICK.
I NEED YOU IN MAKEUP
FOR THE NEXT SHOT.

22:52.500 --> 22:53.667
HELLO, LOVE.
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
HI, TODD.

22:53.667 --> 22:57.375
UH, NATASHA, HAVE YOU
MET DAWSON'S FRIEND--
JOEY, ISN'T IT?

23:02.375 --> 23:03.834
OH, MY GOD.

23:03.834 --> 23:05.708
THIS IS HER, ISN'T IT?

23:05.708 --> 23:06.792
NATASHA--

23:06.792 --> 23:09.250
YOU HAVE THE NERVE
TO BRING HER HERE TONIGHT,

23:09.250 --> 23:12.625
THE GIRL YOU DUMPED ME FOR
AFTER I GAVE YOU
THE BEST SEX OF YOUR LIFE?

23:12.625 --> 23:13.500
CAN WE--
I'M JUST QUOTING YOU,
DAWSON.

23:15.834 --> 23:18.125
SORRY...YOU EMBARRASSED?

23:18.125 --> 23:21.375
'CAUSE I WOULDN'T WANT
TO EMBARRASS DAWSON LEERY,

23:21.375 --> 23:23.917
WHAT WITH HIS CHIVALROUS
NATURE AND OH-SO-QUIET
DIGNITY.S

23:23.917 --> 23:26.250
SEE, DAWSON'S
THE KINDA GUY WHO'LL WALK
A GIRL HOME, YOU KNOW,

23:26.250 --> 23:29.375
HELP HER OVER
A RAIN PUDDLE?

23:29.375 --> 23:31.333
REAL GENTLEMAN.

23:31.333 --> 23:33.166
THEN HE'LL SLEEP WITH HER,
TELL HER SHE'S THE BEST
HE EVER HAD,

23:33.166 --> 23:34.667
AND BREAK UP WITH HER
ANSWERING MACHINE.

23:36.417 --> 23:38.625
SO NICE TO MEET YOU.

23:38.625 --> 23:41.041
I'LL BE IN MY TRAILER
IF YOU NEED ME.

23:59.583 --> 24:02.250
I THINK MY FAVORITE
IS THE ONE WHERE THEY
LEGALIZE GAMBLING

24:02.250 --> 24:03.708
AND MARGE GETS ADDICTED.

24:03.708 --> 24:05.917
ALTHOUGH, THE ONE
WHERE HOMER BECOMES
A MONORAIL CONDUCTOR

24:05.917 --> 24:08.208
IS AWESOME, TOO.

24:08.208 --> 24:11.250
YEAH. MY FAVORITE
IS WHEN SELMA...SHE
MARRIES TROY McCLURE.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.375
HA HA HA! A CLASSIC.
CLASSIC.

24:13.375 --> 24:16.250
I CAN'T EVEN
BELIEVE I'M HAVING
A CONVERSATION LIKE THIS

24:16.250 --> 24:17.458
WITH MY PROFESSOR.

24:17.458 --> 24:19.041
LAST YEAR, I DON'T
EVEN THINK I KNEW
WHO MY PROFESSORS WERE!

24:19.041 --> 24:22.417
REALLY?
NAW, IT'S...

24:22.417 --> 24:24.875
I WAS KINDA...
MESSED UP.

24:24.875 --> 24:26.875
ACADEMICALLY
SPEAKING, ANYWAY.

24:26.875 --> 24:28.625
WELL, I'M SURPRISED
TO HEAR THAT.

24:28.625 --> 24:29.458
I THINK YOUR WORK
IS EXCELLENT.

24:29.458 --> 24:31.625
I REALLY ENJOYED
THAT LAST PAPER YOU WROTE.

24:31.625 --> 24:34.375
AH, WELL--
IT WAS GREAT, JACK.
IT WAS GREAT.

24:34.375 --> 24:37.417
YOU HAVE A NATURAL GIFT
FOR LOOKING BENEATH
THE SURFACE

24:37.417 --> 24:39.375
AND SEEING
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON.

24:39.375 --> 24:41.291
I DON'T FIND THAT
IN A LOT OF STUDENTS.
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD.

24:41.291 --> 24:43.750
THANKS. BUT...
I REALLY, UH...

24:43.750 --> 24:45.500
ENJOY YOUR CLASS.

24:45.500 --> 24:47.375
THANKS. (CHUCKLES)

24:50.083 --> 24:53.583
YOU KNOW, I MET MY WIFE
AT A PARTY LIKE THIS
WHEN I WAS IN GRAD SCHOOL.

24:53.583 --> 24:56.500
SHE HAD PURPLE HAIR
ALL THE WAY DOWN
TO HER WAIST.

24:56.500 --> 24:58.625
SEEMS LIKE
A MILLION YEARS AGO.

24:59.417 --> 25:00.291
SHE'S PREGNANT.

25:00.291 --> 25:03.291
SHE JUST TOLD ME
YESTERDAY.

25:03.291 --> 25:05.708
SHE'S AT THIS CONFERENCE
IN PHILADELPHIA.

25:05.708 --> 25:08.333
I JUST COULDN'T SIT
IN THAT APARTMENT
BY MYSELF.

25:08.333 --> 25:09.000
I'M JUST SO...

25:09.000 --> 25:11.708
I DON'T KNOW.

25:11.708 --> 25:16.542
EVERYTHING JUST...
FEELS A LITTLE TOO REAL.

25:16.542 --> 25:19.458
MAYBE THAT'S WHY
I CAME HERE TONIGHT.

25:19.458 --> 25:21.208
HEY, I'M SORRY.
I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING
YOU ALL THIS.

25:21.208 --> 25:23.875
NO, NO, IT--IT'S OK.

25:23.875 --> 25:26.917
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I DON'T MIND.

25:26.917 --> 25:29.208
I JUST FEEL RIDICULOUS
BEING HERE.

25:29.208 --> 25:30.500
WHAT? RIDICULOUS?

25:30.500 --> 25:34.000
IT'S RIDICULOUS
THAT YOU FEEL...
RIDICULOUS.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
(LAUGHING)

25:39.250 --> 25:40.667
(BUSY SIGNAL)

25:42.667 --> 25:43.333
ALL RIGHT.
AM I GONNA HAVE TO

25:43.333 --> 25:45.708
TAKE THAT CELL PHONE
AWAY NOW?

25:45.708 --> 25:48.375
LOOK, IT'S A BUMMER
OF A SITUATION,

25:48.375 --> 25:51.000
BUT THERE ARE NAKED
GIRLS OVER THERE,
PACEY,

25:51.000 --> 25:54.708
GYRATING ON STAGE
FOR OUR HARD-EARNED
DOLLAR BILLS.

25:54.708 --> 25:56.291
MANY OF THEM, PERHAPS,
ARE SINGLE MOTHERS

25:56.291 --> 25:58.583
OR STRUGGLING CO-EDS.

25:58.583 --> 26:00.208
DON'T YOU
WANNA HELP THEM
EARN A LIVING?

26:00.208 --> 26:02.208
SURE. BUT I JUST REALLY
MESSED UP WITH MY GIRL--

26:02.208 --> 26:03.500
I KNOW. I WAS THERE.

26:03.500 --> 26:05.834
LOOK, CAN WE
TALK FOR REAL
FOR A MINUTE...

26:05.834 --> 26:11.667
WITHOUT ALL THAT
MACHO, COMPETITIVE
CO-WORKER BANTER STUFF?

26:11.667 --> 26:11.959
SURE.

26:11.959 --> 26:15.041
ALL RIGHT.

26:15.041 --> 26:16.166
HERE'S THE THING.

26:16.166 --> 26:17.875
I CAN SEE YOU LOVE HER.

26:17.875 --> 26:19.875
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU
PRACTICALLY SCREAMS,

26:19.875 --> 26:21.542
"I AM AN IDIOT IN LOVE,"
AND I RECOGNIZE THAT

26:21.542 --> 26:25.542
BECAUSE I WAS AN IDIOT
IN LOVE ONCE, TOO.

26:25.542 --> 26:27.417
AND I HURT HER,
JUST LIKE YOU DID.

26:27.417 --> 26:29.583
NO. WORSE THAN YOU DID.

26:29.583 --> 26:33.125
AND AFTERWARDS,
I SPENT A WHOLE NIGHT

26:33.125 --> 26:36.458
JUST TRYING TO CALL HER,
CRYING MY EYES OUT
LIKE A BABY.

26:36.458 --> 26:38.083
SHE WOULDN'T
TAKE MY CALL,
SO YOU KNOW WHAT I DID?

26:38.083 --> 26:39.917
WHAT?

26:39.917 --> 26:41.250
SHOWED UP AT HER HOUSE,
KNOCKED ON HER DOOR.

26:41.250 --> 26:43.792
I DIDN'T HAVE
ANY FLOWERS,

26:43.792 --> 26:45.917
DIDN'T HOLD A BOOM BOX
OVER MY HEAD.

26:45.917 --> 26:47.000
IT WAS JUST ME AND HER.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.750
AND I LOOKED AT HER,
AND SHE LOOKED AT ME,

26:49.750 --> 26:52.250
AND I DIDN'T NEED
TO SAY ANYTHING

26:52.250 --> 26:55.917
BECAUSE WE BOTH KNEW
THAT I LOVED HER
AND I WAS SORRY.

26:55.917 --> 26:58.667
THAT'S WHY I DON'T THINK
YOU NEED TO SWEAT THIS.

26:58.667 --> 26:59.125
IF YOU LOVE HER
AND YOU'RE SORRY,

26:59.125 --> 27:02.583
SHE'LL KNOW, MAN.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.417
TCH.

27:06.417 --> 27:07.333
RICH...

27:07.333 --> 27:09.291

FULL OF SUCH

27:09.291 --> 27:12.166

27:12.166 --> 27:13.166
COME ON,
THAT WAS GOLD!

27:13.166 --> 27:15.417
YOU CALL YOURSELF
A SALESMAN SERIOUSLY?

27:15.417 --> 27:17.125
FINE. BUT I AM RIGHT
ABOUT ONE THING.

27:17.125 --> 27:18.166
THERE'S NOTHING MORE
YOU CAN DO NOW,

27:18.166 --> 27:20.750
AND YOU BOTH NEED
TIME TO COOL OFF,
AND YOU'RE HERE,

27:20.750 --> 27:23.125
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL
HAVE SOME FUN,
DON'T YA THINK?

27:23.125 --> 27:25.208
YEAH, SURE.
ALL RIGHT!

27:25.208 --> 27:27.000
SO LET'S GO
SEE SOME STRIPPERS!

27:27.000 --> 27:29.500
YOU LOOK HER
IN THE EYES
AND YOU'LL JUST KNOW?

27:29.500 --> 27:31.792
YOU JUST KNOW.
YOU LOOK AT HER...

27:31.792 --> 27:32.959
YOU'RE REALLY CUTE,
YOU KNOW THAT?

27:32.959 --> 27:35.083
HA.

27:35.083 --> 27:36.417
YES.

27:36.417 --> 27:37.583

27:37.583 --> 27:41.291
VERY DUMB, THOUGH.
AND DON'T FORGET
RICH.

27:41.291 --> 27:43.458
I DON'T MIND.

27:43.458 --> 27:46.625
YOU'RE SWEET, I THINK.

27:46.625 --> 27:48.291
WHA--

27:52.125 --> 27:53.417
SORRY.

27:53.417 --> 27:55.041
HEY, HEY!
YUP?

27:55.041 --> 27:57.083
WHY DON'T WE GO
FIND A PLACE

27:57.083 --> 27:59.250
WHERE WE CAN BE ALONE?

27:59.250 --> 28:00.959
OK. THAT SOUNDS FINE.

28:05.166 --> 28:07.250
YEAH, UM...
I THINK THEY'RE OK,

28:07.250 --> 28:09.625
BUT I KINDA PREFER
THE WHITE STRIPES.

COME ON. WE'RE GOING.

29:16.583 --> 29:17.959
COME ON,
LEAVE HER ALONE!

29:17.959 --> 29:20.417
HEY, HEY, HEY, EASY!

29:20.417 --> 29:21.917
GIRLS, WHY DON'T YOU
GET OUT OF HERE?

29:21.917 --> 29:23.834
OH, MY GOD.
COME ON. COME ON.

29:23.834 --> 29:25.417
COME ON.

29:25.417 --> 29:27.166
COME ON.
IT'S OK. IT'S OK.

29:36.875 --> 29:38.333
WE NEED TO TALK.

29:39.542 --> 29:40.333
OK.

29:40.333 --> 29:42.208
I'VE JUST COME FROM
NATASHA'S TRAILER.

29:42.208 --> 29:43.375
YEAH.

29:43.375 --> 29:45.333
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
HOW ELSE TO SAY THIS.

29:45.333 --> 29:48.125
YOU SCREWED UP, MATE.
SHE WON'T COME OUT
UNTIL YOU'RE GONE.

29:48.125 --> 29:51.333
WHICH GIVES ME NO CHOICE
BUT TO DO SOMETHING
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO,

29:51.333 --> 29:52.417
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE BEST
ASSISTANT I'VE EVER HAD

29:52.417 --> 29:55.125
AND THE ONLY ONE ON SET
I ACTUALLY
DON'T WANNA FIRE.

29:55.125 --> 29:58.417
BUT FOR THE SAKE OF THE FILM,
IT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

29:58.417 --> 29:59.667
I UNDERSTAND.

29:59.667 --> 30:01.625
LOOK, IT'S GOT ME
SO UPSET,

30:01.625 --> 30:03.583
I'M SMOKIN' AGAIN.
YOU SHOULDN'T.

30:03.583 --> 30:06.083
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.291
WE'VE GOT A BIT OF TIME
BEFORE THE NEXT SET-UP.

30:13.291 --> 30:16.166
WHY DON'T YOU
SAY YOUR GOOD-BYES,
GATHER YOUR THINGS?

30:16.166 --> 30:19.834
AND I WANT YOU
TO KEEP IN TOUCH.
MAYBE ON MY NEXT FILM--

30:19.834 --> 30:21.458
YEAH, YEAH.

30:24.959 --> 30:26.083
I'M GONNA
MISS YOU, MATE.

30:51.250 --> 30:53.333
YOU CAN GO.

30:53.333 --> 30:54.375
I THINK I'M GONNA
STAY HERE TONIGHT.

30:54.375 --> 30:55.458
YOU SURE?
YEAH.

30:55.458 --> 30:56.625
OK.

31:13.834 --> 31:15.333
HEY...

31:18.125 --> 31:19.708
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING

31:19.708 --> 31:21.333
LIKE A GLASS OF WATER
MAYBE?

31:21.333 --> 31:23.917
WILL YOU JUST GO?

31:25.708 --> 31:26.000
AUDREY...

31:28.542 --> 31:30.250
SERIOUSLY, JEN...

31:30.250 --> 31:31.166
LEAVE.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.083
I'LL CALL YOU
IN THE MORNING.

32:02.458 --> 32:04.625
YOU'RE STILL HERE.

32:04.625 --> 32:07.500
YEAH, I WAS JUST...

32:07.500 --> 32:09.500
UH...GONNA LEAVE

32:09.500 --> 32:11.583
IN A MINUTE.

32:11.583 --> 32:13.667
I'M SORRY.

32:13.667 --> 32:16.500
I GUESS I WAS
KIND OF MEAN TO YOU
TONIGHT AT FIRST, HUH?

32:16.500 --> 32:17.792
NO, NOT REALLY.

32:23.542 --> 32:27.417
YOU KNOW...

32:27.417 --> 32:28.875
WHAT HAPPENED
TO AUDREY TONIGHT...

32:28.875 --> 32:32.708
IT'S HAPPENED TO ME
BEFORE...

32:32.708 --> 32:34.375
MORE THAN ONCE,

32:34.375 --> 32:36.917
AND...

32:36.917 --> 32:40.500
TO WATCH IT...
TO WATCH HER
GO THROUGH IT WAS...

32:40.500 --> 32:42.291
JUST WEIRD.

32:47.291 --> 32:48.667
NOW YOU KNOW
WHAT A MESS I AM.

32:48.667 --> 32:52.583
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE A MESS.

32:52.583 --> 32:55.417
WELL, THEN YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN PAYING VERY CLOSE
ATTENTION TONIGHT.

32:55.417 --> 32:58.708
NO.

32:58.708 --> 33:00.250
YOU KNOW...

33:00.250 --> 33:01.417
JEN, YOU DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING WRONG
TONIGHT.

33:01.417 --> 33:05.125
AND WHATEVER MISTAKES
YOU HAVE IN YOUR PAST,
THEY'RE OVER,

33:05.125 --> 33:08.083
AND THEY'VE
OBVIOUSLY MADE YOU
A MORE EMPATHETIC

33:08.083 --> 33:10.291
AND MORE
COMPASSIONATE PERSON,

33:10.291 --> 33:13.458
AND I DON'T THINK
THAT'S SUCH A BAD THING.

33:13.458 --> 33:15.500
WELL, THAT'S A VERY NICE
SPIN,

33:15.500 --> 33:16.500
EVEN IF IT'S NOT TRUE.

33:16.500 --> 33:19.125
IT IS TRUE.
YOU JUST HAVE TO LEARN
TO BELIEVE IT.

33:33.166 --> 33:34.417
JOEY.

33:34.417 --> 33:35.667
HI. I WAS SUPPOSED
TO PAY YOU
FOR THE FOOD.

33:35.667 --> 33:38.458
I NEVER DID, SO...

33:38.458 --> 33:39.708
(PAPER CRINKLES)
HERE YOU GO.

33:39.708 --> 33:41.583
THANKS.

33:41.583 --> 33:42.417
SO, LISTEN,

33:42.417 --> 33:45.625
I...THINK I'M GOING
BACK TO CALIFORNIA.

33:45.625 --> 33:49.583
'CAUSE I DON'T REALLY
WORK HERE ANYMORE.

33:52.125 --> 33:52.625
I'M SORRY, DAWSON.

33:52.625 --> 33:54.375
THINGS HAPPEN.

33:59.583 --> 34:02.458
I SHOULD PROBABLY...

34:02.458 --> 34:03.875
GO.

34:03.875 --> 34:06.708
CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

34:08.667 --> 34:10.000
SURE.

34:12.125 --> 34:15.041
DO YOU THINK
IT WOULD HAVE
WORKED OUT BETWEEN US

34:15.041 --> 34:17.333
IF I--IF WE HADN'T--

34:17.958 --> 34:19.958
IF THINGS HAD BEEN
DIFFERENT?

34:24.750 --> 34:26.708
I DON'T KNOW.

34:26.708 --> 34:28.625
I MEAN,
THAT'S THE THING WITH US.

34:28.625 --> 34:30.458
THEY NEVER ARE, ARE THEY?

34:30.458 --> 34:33.291
NO.

34:33.625 --> 34:35.375
I GUESS NOT.

34:40.750 --> 34:42.917
I THINK...

34:42.917 --> 34:44.958
IN A WAY, THAT...

34:44.958 --> 34:47.333
IT'S GOOD, YOU KNOW?

34:47.333 --> 34:49.625
I MEAN,
MAYBE IT'S THE ONLY WAY

34:49.625 --> 34:51.291
THAT WE COULD FINALLY
STAND ON OUR OWN.

34:51.291 --> 34:55.542
YOU KNOW, TO...
HURT EACH OTHER SO MUCH

34:55.542 --> 34:58.333
THAT WE HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO LET GO.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.667
MAYBE OTHERWISE
WE NEVER WOULD.

35:06.041 --> 35:08.333
YEAH.

35:08.333 --> 35:08.375
MAYBE.

35:15.041 --> 35:16.083
I SHOULD GO.

35:16.083 --> 35:16.417
ME, TOO.

35:31.291 --> 35:31.750
Freeman:
THAT ONE?

35:31.750 --> 35:33.375
Jack: YEAH, YEAH.

35:39.291 --> 35:39.917
WELL, THANKS
FOR THE RIDE.

35:39.917 --> 35:42.083
SURE. THANKS FOR
TAKING PITY

35:42.083 --> 35:44.125
AND HANGING OUT
WITH ME ALL NIGHT.

35:44.125 --> 35:45.083
I WASN'T
TAKING PITY ON YOU.

35:45.083 --> 35:47.291
I KNOW.
IT WAS JUST A JOKE.

35:47.291 --> 35:47.917
OH.
HA HA.

35:47.917 --> 35:50.000
I HAD FUN, THOUGH,
TONIGHT.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.542
YEAH, I DID, TOO.

35:51.542 --> 35:52.792
AND I NEEDED IT.

35:52.792 --> 35:54.458
I DON'T THINK I'VE
FELT SO CONFUSED
IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

35:54.458 --> 35:55.959
HERE I AM,
I'M A MARRIED MAN,

35:55.959 --> 35:58.375
MY WIFE IS PREGNANT,
AND, UH...

35:58.375 --> 36:01.792
I'M SHOWING UP
AT A PARTY JUST
'CAUSE I'M HOPING

36:01.792 --> 36:03.834
TO RUN INTO, UH...
A CERTAIN STUDENT.

36:10.917 --> 36:12.834
I JUST SHOCKED YOU,
DIDN'T I?

36:12.834 --> 36:14.625
YOU'RE SHOCKED.

36:14.625 --> 36:16.458
YEAH, YOU DID.

36:18.208 --> 36:20.333
WELL, YOU KNOW,
YOU CAN JUST, UM...

36:20.333 --> 36:21.834
THINK ABOUT IT...

36:21.834 --> 36:23.708
IF YOU WANT, AND...

36:23.708 --> 36:25.291
I'LL, UH...

36:25.291 --> 36:26.583
I'LL JUST KEEP
TEACHING CLASS,

36:26.583 --> 36:28.333
AND I'LL SEE YOU
IN THE CLASS.

36:28.333 --> 36:30.333
YEAH, UH...

36:30.333 --> 36:32.083
I--I'LL SEE YOU
LATER.

36:32.083 --> 36:33.500
RIGHT.
OK.

36:33.500 --> 36:33.834
I'LL SEE YOU.
OK.

36:33.834 --> 36:34.500
BYE.
BYE.

36:44.750 --> 36:46.708
OH, MY GOD.

36:52.875 --> 36:55.125
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

37:00.041 --> 37:02.208
HI THERE.

37:02.208 --> 37:03.375
HI.

37:06.500 --> 37:07.458
SO...CAN WE TALK?

37:11.000 --> 37:12.875
OK, WELL...

37:12.875 --> 37:14.291
AH...(SIGHS)

37:14.291 --> 37:16.375
CAN I JUST GIVE YOU
A CALL IN THE MORNING?

37:20.542 --> 37:24.041
AUDREY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS THAT YOU
WANT ME TO SAY.

37:24.041 --> 37:25.625
I MEAN,
I'M REALLY SORRY, BUT--

37:25.625 --> 37:28.083
MAYBE...

37:28.083 --> 37:30.583
MAYBE YOU CAN JUST
COME INSIDE AND HOLD ME.

37:33.834 --> 37:36.125
YEAH, I CAN DO THAT.

37:36.125 --> 37:38.208
OK.

38:22.291 --> 38:24.083
DAWSON, WAIT.

38:24.083 --> 38:25.000
DON'T GO.

38:27.959 --> 38:29.291
I, UH...

38:29.291 --> 38:30.875
I GOT YOU YOUR JOB
BACK.

38:30.875 --> 38:34.375
SEE, I WAS, UH...

38:34.375 --> 38:35.750
A BIT CRAZY BEFORE.

38:35.750 --> 38:37.166
I, UM...

38:37.166 --> 38:40.125
I SAW THAT GIRL,
AND I FREAKED.

38:40.125 --> 38:44.000
MAYBE PARTLY BECAUSE
I WAS DRUNK...

38:44.000 --> 38:47.959
AND, SEE, I WAS DRUNK
BECAUSE...

38:47.959 --> 38:50.959
I KNEW I WAS
GOING TO SEE YOU
TONIGHT.

38:50.959 --> 38:53.750
AND I WAS AFRAID
OF THAT...

38:53.750 --> 38:56.166
BECAUSE...
WELL, UH...

38:56.166 --> 38:59.667
YOU REALLY HURT ME,
DAWSON.

38:59.667 --> 39:02.041
I MEAN REALLY.

39:02.041 --> 39:05.000
I LIKED YOU A LOT,

39:05.000 --> 39:07.333
AND THEN YOU BROKE UP
WITH ME ON MY
ANSWERING MACHINE--

39:07.333 --> 39:08.458
I KNOW. I'M SO SORRY.

39:10.834 --> 39:14.667
YEAH.

39:14.667 --> 39:16.000
BUT THAT'S NOT WHY
I GOT YOU YOUR JOB
BACK.

39:16.000 --> 39:19.875
OK...THEN WHY?

39:21.834 --> 39:23.333
BECAUSE...

39:23.333 --> 39:26.500
I SAW YOU OUT THERE
TALKING TO HER.

39:26.500 --> 39:29.083
I SAW YOUR FACE
WHEN YOU WERE
WATCHING HER LEAVE,

39:29.083 --> 39:32.500
AND I REALIZED THAT...

39:32.500 --> 39:34.542
SHE HURT YOU WAY MORE
THAN YOU EVER HURT ME.

39:38.583 --> 39:40.542
BUT YOU STILL HURT ME.

39:40.542 --> 39:41.708
A LOT.

39:41.708 --> 39:44.458
I KNOW.

39:46.208 --> 39:47.625
I KNOW YOU KNOW.

39:51.041 --> 39:54.542
COME ON. TODD SAYS
IF YOU'RE NOT BACK
ON SET IN 5 MINUTES,

39:54.542 --> 39:56.542
YOU'RE FIRED AGAIN.

40:04.708 --> 40:07.625
SO, UH, THAT GUY
FROM THE MOVIE SET...

40:07.625 --> 40:09.542
DAWSON?

40:09.542 --> 40:10.959
YEAH.

40:10.959 --> 40:13.083
SO, HE'S, UH...

40:13.083 --> 40:15.792
HE'S NO ONE.
HE'S JUST AN OLD FRIEND.

40:15.792 --> 40:16.417
OH.

40:16.417 --> 40:17.792
SORRY. I DIDN'T
MEAN TO PRY.

40:17.792 --> 40:19.708
I JUST...

40:19.708 --> 40:20.750
CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

40:20.750 --> 40:22.917
SURE.

40:22.917 --> 40:24.250
WHY DO YOU LIKE
THAT BOOK?

40:24.250 --> 40:27.542
IT CAN'T JUST BE BECAUSE
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE
WHO FOLLOW THEIR IMPULSES,

40:27.542 --> 40:29.750
BECAUSE
IT STILL HAS NO STORY,
IT MEANDERS,

40:29.750 --> 40:31.041
AND IT'S KIND OF
MISOGYNISTIC.

40:31.041 --> 40:33.959
YEAH.
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

40:33.959 --> 40:35.667
IT IS ALL THOSE THINGS.

40:35.667 --> 40:37.792
BUT I DON'T KNOW,
I MEAN...

40:37.792 --> 40:39.458
THE FIRST TIME
I READ IT,
IT--IT BLEW MY MIND.

40:39.458 --> 40:42.792
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE
THIS--THIS CELEBRATION

40:42.792 --> 40:45.333
OF MADNESS

40:45.333 --> 40:47.417
ABOUT PEOPLE
WHO AREN'T AFRAID,

40:47.417 --> 40:50.291
WHO TAKE CHANCES,
PEOPLE WHO REALLY
LIVE.

40:50.291 --> 40:53.583
AND I GUESS
THAT I'VE ALWAYS...

40:53.583 --> 40:55.542
WANTED TO BE
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE,
YOU KNOW?

41:16.125 --> 41:17.125
WHAT WAS THAT?

41:17.125 --> 41:19.458
JUST FOLLOWING
AN IMPULSE.

41:20.166 --> 41:22.208
NO, YOU WEREN'T.

41:22.208 --> 41:23.458
I'M SORRY?

41:23.458 --> 41:26.417
IT'S THAT GUY.
FROM THE MOVIE SET.

41:26.417 --> 41:29.708
YOU'RE ANGRY AT HIM,
AND HE HURT YOU,

41:29.708 --> 41:32.583
AND THAT'S
HOW YOU CHOSE
TO DEAL WITH IT.

41:32.583 --> 41:34.667
OH, THANK YOU,
DR. FREUD.

41:34.667 --> 41:37.000
TELL ME I'M WRONG.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.417
YOU'RE WRONG.

41:39.417 --> 41:42.083
NO. NO, I'M NOT.

41:42.083 --> 41:45.500
LOOK...I DON'T MIND YOU
KISSING ME

41:45.500 --> 41:47.917
IF IT'S BECAUSE
YOU WANT TO KISS ME,

41:47.917 --> 41:50.375
NOT FOR REVENGE
OR TO HELP YOU
FORGET SOMEONE ELSE.

41:50.375 --> 41:53.333
WHATEVER HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU GUYS,

41:53.333 --> 41:55.500
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
DEAL WITH IT.

41:55.500 --> 41:56.792
YOURSELF.
JUST--JUST YOU.

42:05.125 --> 42:06.333
LOOK, UH...

42:06.333 --> 42:10.041
I'LL GIVE YOU
A RIDE HOME, OK?

42:10.041 --> 42:11.125
I'M JUST GONNA...

42:11.125 --> 42:13.208
GET MY COAT.
