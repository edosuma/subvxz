WEBVTT

00:00.221 --> 00:01.815
Just a little gift for later.

00:01.841 --> 00:03.805
It's for $30,000.

00:04.588 --> 00:06.014
I was gonna wait till the baby was born,

00:06.039 --> 00:07.679
but I thought maybe you could
use it now to get set up.

00:07.879 --> 00:09.899
- It's nothing to Mitchell.
- That's not the point.

00:10.079 --> 00:12.439
I don't wanna be 30 grand
in debt to your ex-boyfriend!

00:12.639 --> 00:14.839
You were out of home at 17, Dad. I'm 31.

00:15.039 --> 00:16.639
It's a very different
circumstance, mate.

00:16.779 --> 00:18.199
Are we seriously becoming the family

00:18.399 --> 00:21.154
that has to convince our
mother that her Botox is OK?

00:21.179 --> 00:22.639
I have got to move out.

00:22.839 --> 00:25.719
I think I've met the one.
Which is the everything part.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.319
I can't stop thinking about him.

00:27.519 --> 00:28.870
You're working with him.

00:29.171 --> 00:30.980
Suss him out, tell me what you think.

00:30.999 --> 00:32.238
You hot for him or something?

00:32.519 --> 00:33.839
- What?
- You heard me.

00:34.039 --> 00:35.339
- No.
- You are.

00:35.459 --> 00:36.479
I am not!

00:36.619 --> 00:38.279
Jack was just a total hero with Eric,

00:38.479 --> 00:41.319
and now I'm rethinking
our compatibility levels.

00:41.459 --> 00:44.399
I think they might be as high as 70%.

00:46.639 --> 00:47.639
Oh, my God.

00:47.839 --> 00:50.079
Honestly, I thought it was funny.
I didn't give it a second thought.

00:50.219 --> 00:51.999
It's just Simone's my best friend...

00:52.199 --> 00:55.199
Look, Simone and I,
whatever happens between us

00:55.399 --> 00:57.359
is completely separate to you and I.

00:57.559 --> 00:58.559
Oh!

00:58.759 --> 00:59.999
- Simone...
- Oh, no.

01:00.199 --> 01:03.519
Take it! Yep, t-t-take...
Do-don't mention anything about me.

01:05.379 --> 01:07.199
OK, I'm here, where are you?

01:07.399 --> 01:09.439
The station, outside the station.

01:09.639 --> 01:11.919
OK, there are four different
exits to the station,

01:12.119 --> 01:13.639
so which one do you think you might...

01:13.779 --> 01:15.979
Um, I've forgotten how to breathe.

01:16.159 --> 01:18.759
OK, you're definitely breathing, Simone.

01:18.899 --> 01:20.899
Breathe. Tell me what you can see.

01:21.019 --> 01:22.959
Uh, buildings...

01:23.099 --> 01:25.559
People and cars...

01:25.699 --> 01:27.479
OK, can you drop a pin for me?

01:27.679 --> 01:29.759
- Go into your maps...
- My phone's not working...

01:29.959 --> 01:32.519
You're speaking on it,
Simone! You're speaking on it!

01:32.719 --> 01:36.199
- Water! Flowing water! I'm in it.
- OK!

01:39.699 --> 01:43.679
Lil! Oh, my God. I can't
believe you're here.

01:43.879 --> 01:45.979
- Hang on.
- What are the odds, huh?

01:46.159 --> 01:49.839
- You, and me and the fountain.
- Just stay there.

01:57.559 --> 01:59.119
It's OK, I've got you.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.519
Ugh.

02:07.659 --> 02:10.799
You wanted to see me? What's wrong?

02:10.999 --> 02:14.319
- This Saturday, my sister's getting
- married in the Barossa Valley,

02:14.459 --> 02:16.199
and I'm a bridesmaid.

02:16.399 --> 02:17.479
- Lovely.
- It's not.

02:17.679 --> 02:20.259
It's offensive on a number of
levels, but it's good for you

02:20.379 --> 02:22.959
because I want you to call the show.

02:23.099 --> 02:27.119
Really? Are you... are you sure?

02:27.319 --> 02:28.979
- I'm not...
- No. Do not hesitate.

02:29.159 --> 02:31.439
Something like this happens, you've
gotta grab it with both hands.

02:31.639 --> 02:35.199
We're going again. Lily, could
you call the show Saturday?

02:35.399 --> 02:38.079
Just first, has this been run by Eric?

02:38.279 --> 02:40.759
Last chance! Lily, this
Saturday, could you...

02:40.959 --> 02:43.919
I would love to call
the show this Saturday.

02:44.119 --> 02:47.079
I believe I'm ready and
I will not let you down.

02:47.279 --> 02:49.979
You better not.

02:50.099 --> 02:51.479
Now what are you doing? Get working.

02:51.679 --> 02:53.319
- This is make or break.
- Yes, sorry.

02:53.459 --> 02:54.519
Mmm, oh.

02:54.699 --> 02:55.979
Mmm, oh.

02:58.399 --> 03:01.839
Oh, my God! Congratulations!

03:02.039 --> 03:04.919
Oh. What do we even call your job now?

03:05.119 --> 03:07.919
It's still the same job,
Simone, it's just one show.

03:09.005 --> 03:11.479
- Yeah, but it's a big step, right?
- Big-ish.

03:11.679 --> 03:15.319
Well, get changed because
I called Jack and Vincent

03:15.459 --> 03:17.039
and we are going to Mister Nicol's.

03:17.239 --> 03:20.519
- What? No, I'm not going anywhere.
- But it's your big night!

03:20.719 --> 03:23.559
I will celebrate on Saturday
night, if it's a success.

03:23.759 --> 03:25.899
- What is that?
- Your number one outfit select.

03:26.099 --> 03:28.639
I also have second,
third and fourth options.

03:28.839 --> 03:33.039
Please. Do it for Vincent.

03:33.239 --> 03:35.719
He said if he doesn't get a
night away from your mother,

03:35.859 --> 03:37.619
he might literally explode.

03:37.799 --> 03:39.439
- I said he could stay over.
- Oh...

03:39.639 --> 03:43.479
Also, Jack's coming, and I
really need this to go well,

03:43.679 --> 03:46.559
because he said that he wanted
to have dinner and a chat.

03:46.759 --> 03:48.439
What's wrong with
that? That sounds good.

03:48.579 --> 03:50.479
I'm bad with dinner and chats.

03:50.679 --> 03:53.799
The best times with me and
Jack have been at parties.

03:53.999 --> 03:57.539
I just wanna get back to that
cool Simone, queen of celebration,

03:57.739 --> 04:00.119
who's really amazing
with her paralysed friend.

04:00.259 --> 04:02.639
I think that will fix it.

04:02.839 --> 04:07.679
OK, I will come for one drink, but
I'm not staying all night and...

04:07.879 --> 04:10.539
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

04:11.795 --> 04:13.119
I-I-I've not
finished that.

04:13.319 --> 04:15.199
Yeah, I think I should
get you a fresh one.

04:15.399 --> 04:17.759
- I know you think I'm a dickhead.
- I don't.

04:17.959 --> 04:19.358
- A financial dickhead.
- Maybe.

04:19.499 --> 04:21.159
But can you just give me a year?

04:21.358 --> 04:23.799
Give me a year to make the
money myself. If I can, great.

04:23.999 --> 04:26.839
If I can't, then Mitchell's
offer will still be there.

04:27.039 --> 04:28.439
Who's that?

04:28.579 --> 04:30.259
Ah, it's Simone.

04:30.439 --> 04:33.534
Lily's had some career thing,
they're just having drinks.

04:33.559 --> 04:36.119
And you'd rather be there than
here, arguing over finances?

04:36.259 --> 04:39.559
What? No, I love finances!

04:39.759 --> 04:43.119
You can go out with your
friends, Pete. It's OK.

04:46.079 --> 04:48.999
- And you can have nine months.
- Nine months?

04:49.199 --> 04:51.439
To try and get it together financially.

04:51.579 --> 04:52.959
But if we still need more...

04:53.159 --> 04:55.619
Then we can surgically
remove my ball sack.

04:55.739 --> 04:56.719
Oh, please, don't say that.

04:56.799 --> 04:59.719
Then I'll go to Mitchell and
I'll accept his offer gratefully.

04:59.919 --> 05:02.077
- OK? Promise.
- Good.

05:09.336 --> 05:11.839
Oh, my clever girl!

05:12.913 --> 05:14.214
No, not that clever yet.

05:14.239 --> 05:16.839
Hopefully the cleverness
will happen on Saturday.

05:17.039 --> 05:20.094
- Oh. Oh, I've got that.
- No, Mum, it's fine. I've got it.

05:20.119 --> 05:22.319
- No, it's fine. It's fine.
- I can... I can take it.

05:22.459 --> 05:25.279
Darling, just while I've got you...

05:25.419 --> 05:27.759
She is caving my head in.

05:27.959 --> 05:29.899
Promise me you won't
let him get too drunk.

05:30.079 --> 05:35.119
Mum, I think his goal for the night
is to get drunk. He'll be fine.

05:35.319 --> 05:37.359
- Go.
- Alright. Alright.

05:40.159 --> 05:42.319
Don't forget to turn him, if
he's been drinking heavily.

05:42.459 --> 05:44.199
Mum, I won't forget. Go.

05:48.379 --> 05:50.399
So, basically, you're set for life?

05:50.599 --> 05:54.517
It's one show. And I could
completely stuff it up!

05:54.559 --> 05:57.319
- I could be unemployed on Sunday.
- You know you won't.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.959
And how did he react?

06:00.159 --> 06:02.479
The chef? Did he give you
a bit of congratulations?

06:02.679 --> 06:04.479
- He was super-professional.
- Mmm-hmm.

06:04.619 --> 06:05.959
That's how we are now.

06:06.099 --> 06:07.439
Well done.

06:08.039 --> 06:10.599
I'm assuming I come
to you for a raise now?

06:13.919 --> 06:16.639
So, no residue from
your little moment, then?

06:16.839 --> 06:18.679
- Shut up!
- What? She can't hear.

06:19.839 --> 06:21.599
There was no moment.

06:21.799 --> 06:23.319
- OK?
- OK.

06:23.519 --> 06:26.259
Simone is completely paranoid
he's gonna break it off with her.

06:26.459 --> 06:27.679
- Is he?
- How would I know?

06:27.879 --> 06:29.079
- Because of you?
- No!

06:29.279 --> 06:30.999
We're not talking about this anymore.

06:31.199 --> 06:33.479
- OK.
- Let's do you.

06:33.679 --> 06:36.999
OK, well, in light of the 30
grand offer the other night,

06:37.199 --> 06:39.399
Meredith decided we needed
to talk about money...

06:39.599 --> 06:41.359
No, no, I've got... I've got...

06:41.559 --> 06:44.559
Look, I mean, this isn't
everything, obviously.

06:44.759 --> 06:47.079
I've got super accounts. Heaps of them.

06:48.379 --> 06:51.479
So, I thought, OK, I'm just gonna
double down with the writing.

06:51.679 --> 06:54.199
It's 1,500 words, rapping
in an Australian accent.

06:54.339 --> 06:55.899
Is there a cringe factor? Why?

06:56.079 --> 06:58.079
Boy bands of the '80s?
Where are they now?

06:58.279 --> 07:02.119
Rehab? Reality TV? Total
obscurity? Who knows?

07:02.319 --> 07:04.639
It's the day of the gig,
track the band dawn till dawn,

07:04.839 --> 07:06.839
from sound check to groupie three-ways.

07:06.979 --> 07:08.359
Probably not literally.

07:08.559 --> 07:11.014
I had one of my best days
ever. I sold three articles.

07:11.039 --> 07:15.279
But that only amounted to $802,
so basically I'm 20 bucks away from

07:15.479 --> 07:17.934
either, A, letting my
girlfriend's ex pay for my child

07:17.959 --> 07:19.919
or, B, begging Bernard
the Cock for a job.

07:20.119 --> 07:23.639
What about C, you go out and get
a normal job, like a normal person?

07:23.839 --> 07:25.399
- Thanks for that insight, Lil.
- You're welcome.

07:25.539 --> 07:26.619
Knew you'd be understanding.

07:26.799 --> 07:28.599
I am understanding!
Pete, you are normal.

07:28.799 --> 07:30.279
Remember to inhale. Remember to inhale.

07:30.479 --> 07:32.179
Oh, my God, he is gorgeous.
You're making me nervous.

07:32.379 --> 07:34.039
Is that dimple real, or is
that surgically enhanced?

07:34.239 --> 07:36.119
I'm not playing. You
need to learn to be quiet.

07:36.319 --> 07:38.254
- I'm a bit nervous.
- It's a real dimple, actually.

07:38.279 --> 07:39.254
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:39.279 --> 07:41.774
Lil. I didn't realise we
were all going to be here.

07:41.799 --> 07:43.434
Really? I thought Sim
would have told you...

07:43.459 --> 07:45.554
- This is Pete!
- I have heard so much about you.

07:45.579 --> 07:46.894
You're basically all we talk about.

07:46.919 --> 07:48.614
- What?
- Yeah, no, totally.

07:48.639 --> 07:50.914
Like, I'd say three
conversations a day, minimum.

07:50.939 --> 07:52.559
He's just being weird.

07:52.759 --> 07:53.919
Don't be weird. Ah!

07:54.119 --> 07:55.734
Sorry, Pete, was it?

07:55.759 --> 07:58.414
- Yep, yep.
- How do you know Simone?

07:58.439 --> 08:02.919
I'm sure that I've spoken
to you about Pete before!

08:03.119 --> 08:06.319
Um, remember when I
was telling you the...

08:06.519 --> 08:09.259
Mmm? Uh, just so many times!

08:09.439 --> 08:11.819
- I can't think of one specific thing!
- Too many.

08:12.019 --> 08:16.208
Basically, whenever I speak
about my friend, I mean Pete.

08:17.380 --> 08:18.439
Let's dance!

08:18.940 --> 08:22.080
- Have fun. Get stuck into it.
- 'Bye.

08:23.237 --> 08:25.177
OK, first discovery.
I mean nothing to you.

08:25.357 --> 08:26.997
Second, they are totally on the rocks.

08:27.197 --> 08:29.117
And third, it's
definitely because of you.

08:33.797 --> 08:35.917
I just thought it was going
to be the two of us tonight.

08:37.037 --> 08:38.197
Oh, it was.

08:38.397 --> 08:42.357
But then Lily's job thing happened,
so I thought... celebration!

08:42.496 --> 08:43.917
I do have to work tomorrow,

08:44.116 --> 08:45.717
so probably can't
stay out all that long.

08:47.397 --> 08:50.677
Jack... are you not that into this?

08:50.817 --> 08:52.237
What?

08:54.337 --> 08:57.352
'Cause I'm... really into you.

08:57.377 --> 09:00.357
Like, the other day I realised

09:00.557 --> 09:03.357
we don't actually have
a picture together.

09:03.557 --> 09:06.957
I didn't actually Photoshop one, but...

09:08.537 --> 09:12.757
That's where I'm at, but I
feel like you're not there.

09:12.957 --> 09:16.237
It's just been so hectic with
the restaurant and the show.

09:17.697 --> 09:21.817
You know what? I think we need to
sit down and have a proper chat.

09:23.457 --> 09:24.457
A chat?

09:24.657 --> 09:26.317
I reckon you should come
around to mine tomorrow,

09:26.517 --> 09:29.317
I'll cook dinner and we can
talk, just the two of us.

09:31.657 --> 09:33.037
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

09:33.177 --> 09:34.837
Maybe he was just tired?

09:34.977 --> 09:36.957
I feel that. I respect that.

09:37.157 --> 09:40.397
- He only stayed for 15 minutes.
- It was over an hour.

09:40.597 --> 09:43.517
And he invited you over to have
dinner with him tomorrow night.

09:43.717 --> 09:46.817
- That's great.
- He wants to end it with dinner.

09:46.997 --> 09:49.457
- Like the mafia.
- No.

09:49.657 --> 09:51.917
And the mafia would
do it in a restaurant.

09:52.117 --> 09:55.597
I think that you and I
should just get out there,

09:55.797 --> 09:58.557
dance till dawn, make it
the best night in forever,

09:58.757 --> 10:01.237
and make everyone in
this bar jealous of us.

10:01.437 --> 10:06.677
Or, alternatively, we go
home, we put on our PJ's,

10:06.877 --> 10:10.597
we stick on 'Spice World', and
we crack into the ice-cream.

10:12.017 --> 10:14.177
Hah!

10:14.297 --> 10:16.837
No. Come on. Let's go.

10:19.037 --> 10:22.277
I think I actually left the
ice-cream out in preparation, so it...

10:22.477 --> 10:24.557
- Hey! Baby!
- Hey!

10:24.697 --> 10:25.997
You came!

10:26.197 --> 10:28.197
God, you texted Lucas already?

10:28.397 --> 10:30.277
I just... he makes me
feel good about myself.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.037
That's what he does.

10:32.237 --> 10:35.317
- I'm not gonna sleep with him.
- You always sleep with him.

10:35.517 --> 10:37.317
- Lillinator!
- Hi.

10:37.517 --> 10:41.757
Looking fine tonight.
This cocktail, yours?

10:41.957 --> 10:44.037
- Don't mention it.
- Uh, no, really, I won't.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.477
Baby, baby, what's wrong?

10:46.617 --> 10:49.637
I'm fine. I just... I want to dance.

10:49.777 --> 10:51.357
Well, come on, baby, on the floor!

10:51.557 --> 10:55.817
Come on, baby, on the floor!
Come on, baby, on the floor!

10:55.937 --> 10:58.197
Just stay out of it, Lillinator.

10:59.677 --> 11:01.197
I am out of it.

11:04.397 --> 11:05.877
Yep, so is he.

11:11.386 --> 11:14.130
Feel bad kicking you out of
your bed on your night of glory.

11:14.605 --> 11:17.946
The glory faded long ago.

11:18.146 --> 11:21.846
So, who is she officially
screwing, Jack or Lucas?

11:21.986 --> 11:23.486
It's alright, I've got it.

11:23.686 --> 11:27.260
Uh, officially Jack. Unofficially Lucas.

11:27.285 --> 11:30.326
- Right. Do either of them know?
- No-one knows.

11:30.351 --> 11:33.886
- Presumably Simone does.
- Oh, Simone is across it, yes.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.660
Lil, um, I've gotta
get out of mum's place.

11:38.692 --> 11:42.020
I love her, but she's
draining my will to live.

11:44.280 --> 11:45.660
You comfy?

11:45.800 --> 11:49.500
Snug as a bug in a waterproof rug.

11:50.645 --> 11:52.540
- Night.
- Night, Lil.

11:54.000 --> 12:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:19.728 --> 12:21.620
Shh. Stay asleep. Stay asleep.

12:45.068 --> 12:46.468
- Good morning.
- Morning.

12:47.848 --> 12:49.188
Did you get my email?

12:49.388 --> 12:52.068
Yeah, I liked the second
idea. The 15-minute challenge.

12:52.121 --> 12:54.188
Great, yeah, every time
we've done a time challenge,

12:54.328 --> 12:56.828
it's played really well on screen.

12:57.028 --> 13:00.308
- How did Simone go last night?
- Um, in what sense?

13:00.508 --> 13:04.513
- She seemed a bit down.
- Um, yeah. She perked up.

13:04.538 --> 13:07.228
So, I was thinking we could
split the segment in two.

13:07.428 --> 13:09.288
Did you guys stay out late last night?

13:09.488 --> 13:12.708
No, no, we got home, it would
have been shortly after midnight.

13:16.508 --> 13:17.868
Excuse me.

13:19.148 --> 13:20.508
Hello?

13:20.708 --> 13:24.468
- I can't feel my nostrils.
- What? Where are you?

13:24.668 --> 13:27.588
I can't feel my nostrils
and I can't breathe.

13:27.788 --> 13:30.288
- OK, just tell me where you are.
- I don't know.

13:30.408 --> 13:33.108
Lucas left. I'm so hot!

13:33.208 --> 13:36.808
OK, are you outside? Can you
see a street sign or something?

13:36.833 --> 13:39.908
Uh, I can see... the station.

13:40.088 --> 13:41.928
Yeah, the station near the club.

13:42.068 --> 13:44.688
Stay put. I'm coming to you.

13:48.248 --> 13:50.768
- Everything OK?
- Yeah, I've, um...

13:50.968 --> 13:53.328
I've just got a bit
of a family emergency.

13:53.468 --> 13:54.508
Who?

13:54.608 --> 13:57.128
It's, um... it's a mum and
Vincent thing. I'm sure it's fine.

13:57.328 --> 13:59.208
- Need me to give you a lift?
- No. You stay here.

13:59.408 --> 14:03.008
Can you just pick a recipe that fits,
and I'll be back in half an hour?

14:03.208 --> 14:05.548
Let me know if I can help.

14:11.268 --> 14:12.408
Oh!

14:12.454 --> 14:13.908
- Lil!
- Hi.

14:14.088 --> 14:16.768
Oh, my God! I can't believe you're here!

14:16.805 --> 14:19.048
- Hang on.
- What are the odds, huh?

14:19.248 --> 14:22.928
- You and me and the fountain.
- OK, hang on.

14:27.568 --> 14:30.208
- Come on. Come on. Hey.
- Oh.

14:34.448 --> 14:36.968
Can you remember what you took?

14:37.168 --> 14:42.088
No, I was so hot, and
I couldn't breathe,

14:42.228 --> 14:45.128
and everyone had left, you know?

14:45.268 --> 14:46.648
Yeah.

14:46.848 --> 14:48.288
Come on.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.268
Come on, we'll get you
looked at, honey. Come on.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.928
Don't worry.

14:57.068 --> 14:58.828
Alright, I gotcha.

15:02.608 --> 15:07.568
- You look really tired, babe. You OK?
- I'm fine.

15:09.468 --> 15:11.328
Nothing to see here.

15:13.768 --> 15:15.128
Nice deep breath in.

15:16.968 --> 15:19.828
And out.

15:20.028 --> 15:22.908
And in.

15:23.088 --> 15:26.248
Good. And out.

15:26.388 --> 15:28.488
See, you're nailing it.

15:28.688 --> 15:30.768
You won't even have to
think about it in a minute.

15:30.803 --> 15:32.688
So she's OK?

15:32.713 --> 15:35.548
Yeah, she's dehydrated,
but her temperature's fine.

15:35.748 --> 15:39.208
You did really well,
cooling off in the fountain.

15:39.408 --> 15:42.208
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:42.574 --> 15:44.645
Is it safe to leave her alone?

15:44.670 --> 15:46.828
Yeah, I can look after her.

15:48.081 --> 15:50.101
- Bless you.
- Come on.

15:50.126 --> 15:51.331
One more sip.

15:54.994 --> 15:56.534
Everything OK?

15:56.559 --> 15:59.894
Yeah. It was a... it's
fine. All fine. Yeah.

16:00.094 --> 16:01.813
Sasha was looking for you.
I said you were on a call.

16:02.024 --> 16:03.429
Thanks.

16:06.269 --> 16:10.469
First curve ball. There's
a problem. With Eric.

16:10.609 --> 16:12.389
He doesn't want me to call the show?

16:12.589 --> 16:15.229
No, no. You're fine
this week. It's Erica.

16:15.429 --> 16:18.729
He's concerned that Erica has been
looking smarter than him on air.

16:18.909 --> 16:22.009
- In the Talking Point segment?
- Started with that, yeah.

16:22.209 --> 16:25.149
Eric, where do you stand on
constitutional acknowledgement?

16:27.929 --> 16:29.269
Well, I-I...

16:30.649 --> 16:32.009
I concur.

16:32.209 --> 16:34.509
With me? Or with the current
wording of the preamble?

16:37.056 --> 16:37.729
Both.

16:37.929 --> 16:39.649
Then in the Entertainment Round-Up,

16:39.769 --> 16:41.389
she corrected his pronunciation.

16:41.589 --> 16:44.189
Now, believe it or not, it's 30 years

16:44.389 --> 16:45.829
since the release of 'Whispering Jack'.

16:46.029 --> 16:48.369
No?! It is. I know, I can't believe it.

16:48.569 --> 16:51.509
- Farnsie's se-my-nal album...
- Seminal.

16:51.709 --> 16:54.029
I think the word's 'seminal'.

16:54.229 --> 16:55.949
Then she laughed in his face...

16:56.089 --> 16:58.549
Look, I'm sorry, I really am,

16:58.749 --> 17:02.289
but a responsible parent
immunises their child.

17:02.489 --> 17:06.029
I mean, I am just so sick of
these anti-vasectomy people.

17:13.029 --> 17:16.368
Eric wants a brain, which is
something we'll have to outsource.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.749
So I've told him we'll stick
some brainiac on the mic,

17:18.949 --> 17:21.309
feed him stats, facts,
gags, whatever he wants.

17:21.509 --> 17:23.549
Can one of us do that,
or do we need to get...?

17:23.749 --> 17:25.368
You'll be too busy.
He doesn't like Dale.

17:25.569 --> 17:29.109
And Nikkii... can't do
it, for obvious reasons.

17:30.729 --> 17:32.829
What? You thinking of someone?

17:33.029 --> 17:34.829
They should be good at
massaging egos as well.

17:34.969 --> 17:37.389
How much money would we be offering?

17:37.589 --> 17:39.649
I'm conflicted. I feel
flattered that you're asking,

17:39.849 --> 17:41.509
because I'm possibly the
smartest person you know.

17:41.709 --> 17:43.949
- Not the reason.
- But then I feel a little...

17:44.089 --> 17:48.729
What? Grateful? Thankful? Excited?

17:48.849 --> 17:50.749
It's not exactly my area, Lily.

17:50.889 --> 17:52.509
Pete, I thought you were saying

17:52.709 --> 17:54.829
you were in some sort
of financial crisis?

17:56.729 --> 17:59.509
- How many days are we talking?
- Well, Saturday would be a trial.

17:59.709 --> 18:02.829
But if it worked, potentially
every Saturday and Sunday.

18:03.029 --> 18:05.109
- And you'd be my boss?
- Yes, on Saturday.

18:05.309 --> 18:07.429
After that, not your
boss, but your superior.

18:07.569 --> 18:09.029
The dynamic should feel familiar.

18:11.149 --> 18:13.109
Pete, what is there to think about?

18:13.309 --> 18:15.189
I would still like to work in an area

18:15.389 --> 18:17.189
that I'm actually
interested in, you know?

18:17.389 --> 18:21.429
Just so we're clear, you'd rather
risk your baby starving to death

18:22.017 --> 18:23.069
than take this job?

18:25.309 --> 18:26.749
What was that?

18:26.845 --> 18:28.775
I just wanted to record
the moment that you used

18:28.800 --> 18:31.029
the potential death of my
baby to win an argument.

18:31.229 --> 18:36.149
Well... there is a record
of the disdain you displayed

18:36.349 --> 18:39.469
when I put myself on the
line to get you employment.

18:39.669 --> 18:42.189
That's you being ridiculously
inflammatory to win an argument.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.029
Oh, no, wait. That's you every day.

18:44.169 --> 18:46.009
Pete, are you interested or not?

18:46.129 --> 18:48.149
Uh...

18:48.289 --> 18:50.109
Can I have a day to think about it?

18:50.309 --> 18:52.649
You can have 12 hours, max.
That's to think about it.

18:52.769 --> 18:54.229
But I suggest you spend longer

18:54.429 --> 18:55.789
thinking about your
behaviour here today.

18:56.989 --> 18:58.869
Inflammatory.

19:09.869 --> 19:10.929
I really like it.

19:11.029 --> 19:14.089
I just feel like it's
getting a bit... intelligent.

19:14.289 --> 19:16.289
I love that that's
become a derogatory term.

19:16.489 --> 19:19.789
It's the talking point segment.
It's meant to be vaguely intelligent.

19:19.989 --> 19:22.229
Personally, I'd swap it
out for Summer Accessories.

19:22.429 --> 19:24.029
Ooh. I really like
Summer Accessories too.

19:24.229 --> 19:26.429
I mean, summer accessories
is a proven winner.

19:26.629 --> 19:29.649
But, hey, if you wanna use your one
chance for some kamikaze talk-fest,

19:29.769 --> 19:32.109
well, I do respect your bravery.

19:32.309 --> 19:34.869
- Lily, can I speak to you?
- Just a sec.

19:39.209 --> 19:41.029
I just spoke to Simone.

19:44.101 --> 19:45.869
Yesterday, I asked you, specifically,

19:46.009 --> 19:47.389
did Simone get home OK?

19:47.589 --> 19:49.189
- You said yes.
- I know, but I...

19:49.389 --> 19:51.069
Why would you ever say
someone's safe and sound,

19:51.269 --> 19:52.649
when they haven't even come home yet?

19:52.769 --> 19:54.469
She's fine. I just checked on her.

19:54.669 --> 19:57.309
I'm sorry. I didn't think it
was my place to say anything.

19:57.509 --> 19:59.389
- Who's this Lucas?
- Oh. Oh.

19:59.589 --> 20:02.789
- Can we talk about this later?
- You obviously know him.

20:02.929 --> 20:05.229
Lucas is... he's Simone's ex.

20:05.429 --> 20:07.369
And she seems to call him
whenever she gets vulnerable.

20:07.489 --> 20:09.709
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.749
I thought everything was off with them,

20:11.949 --> 20:14.709
and it's never really been
on, not in a meaningful way.

20:14.849 --> 20:16.549
It's always just been about sex.

20:19.909 --> 20:21.869
She didn't mention anything about sex.

20:23.729 --> 20:27.749
So, not only did you neglect to
tell me she had a drug problem,

20:27.949 --> 20:31.069
you also failed to mention
she was screwing someone else.

20:31.269 --> 20:34.649
I told Simone to talk
to you about this, I...

20:34.849 --> 20:37.696
What was I supposed to
do? She's my best friend.

20:37.789 --> 20:40.009
She asked me not to say anything.

20:40.849 --> 20:43.009
I couldn't betray my friend.

20:53.297 --> 20:57.497
I mean, I need the work, but I
don't wanna give up on all my dreams.

20:57.697 --> 21:00.672
- Mmm. Nah, dreams are good, mate.
- I know.

21:00.697 --> 21:02.457
- Those are bloody important.
- Exactly.

21:02.657 --> 21:04.897
'Course, Lily's right,
your dreams are on ice now.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.137
- What?
- Yeah.

21:06.317 --> 21:08.177
Will be for the next 20 years, at least.

21:08.317 --> 21:09.737
Then when you thaw them out,

21:09.937 --> 21:11.777
they're not gonna look the
same, I'll tell you what.

21:11.977 --> 21:13.697
Hang on, you were fulfilled,
though, weren't you?

21:13.897 --> 21:15.737
When I was a kid. You
loved playing footy.

21:15.877 --> 21:17.977
Yeah, that was till you were three.

21:18.177 --> 21:20.177
Then it was slogging away,
managing the surf club.

21:21.657 --> 21:24.977
Oh, how low's the bar?
Exactly how bad is this job?

21:25.177 --> 21:29.957
Well, it'd be writing patter,
basically, for this one host,

21:30.077 --> 21:31.897
and it'd take up all the weekend.

21:32.037 --> 21:33.657
How much?

21:33.797 --> 21:35.237
500 a day.

21:35.437 --> 21:37.677
1,000 bucks a week? Writing for telly?

21:37.877 --> 21:40.457
You get to keep your hands
clean and your pants on?

21:40.657 --> 21:43.177
- Well...
- You're a bloody dickhead, mate.

21:43.377 --> 21:46.992
I haven't said no, I just... I don't
wanna make any sudden choices and...

21:47.017 --> 21:49.137
You're done making choices,
you were done making choices

21:49.337 --> 21:51.337
the second that baby started
growing in Lily's belly.

21:51.537 --> 21:55.177
Meredith, Dad. It's Meredith's belly.

21:58.497 --> 22:01.177
It's all on one level, bathroom
and kitchen need updating,

22:01.377 --> 22:04.897
but we'd have to do that
anyway, and what about the area?

22:05.097 --> 22:07.937
- You are unbelievable.
- What?

22:08.137 --> 22:09.777
I'm not buying the
house across the road.

22:09.977 --> 22:12.017
Why not? Darling, it
makes perfect sense.

22:12.217 --> 22:14.897
You can have your independence, and
I'm right over there if you need me.

22:15.097 --> 22:17.057
But I don't need you.
I don't need you, Mum!

22:17.257 --> 22:18.877
That's the point. It's
not just my independence.

22:19.077 --> 22:21.457
I wanna live my life without you
being across every step I take.

22:21.657 --> 22:23.677
Mum, I think Vincent's
just trying to say that

22:23.877 --> 22:27.017
he's 31 years old and
he needs his privacy.

22:27.217 --> 22:29.417
- What for?
- What for?

22:29.617 --> 22:31.097
- Maybe I wanna watch porn!
- Oh.

22:31.297 --> 22:32.937
No, I already watch it. All the time.

22:33.137 --> 22:34.417
- OK, calm down.
- But it's not satisfying.

22:34.617 --> 22:36.297
'Cause I gotta keep a bloody
hand on the door the whole time.

22:36.437 --> 22:38.297
Maybe we can set up a system.

22:38.497 --> 22:39.977
What happens if I wanna
bring someone home?

22:40.177 --> 22:42.297
That's ridiculous, of course you
can bring all your friends home.

22:42.437 --> 22:44.017
Not friends, Mum. Women.

22:44.217 --> 22:46.137
What happens if I want
to bring a woman home

22:46.337 --> 22:49.337
for the sole purpose of having
outrageous porn-inspired sex?

22:49.537 --> 22:52.137
Well, sweetheart, I don't really
think that's on the cards, is it?

22:52.417 --> 22:54.957
Mum. You know that that
is entirely possible.

22:55.077 --> 22:56.617
I'm just being realistic.

22:56.817 --> 22:58.632
I know that one day
you'll find a gorgeous...

22:58.657 --> 23:01.177
Oh, for fuck's sake,
I am so sick of you.

23:02.777 --> 23:05.497
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm sick of you.

23:05.697 --> 23:08.257
- You're sick of me?
- Yes!

23:09.817 --> 23:11.537
You're sick of me?

23:11.737 --> 23:15.337
Just what exactly are
you sick of, Vincent?

23:15.537 --> 23:20.337
Is it the three meals a day?
The round-the-clock care?

23:20.537 --> 23:24.697
The daily massages? What
exactly are you sick of?

23:24.897 --> 23:27.977
I wake up and all I can hear
every morning is your voice,

23:28.177 --> 23:30.857
your nagging voice, all day, every day.

23:31.057 --> 23:33.677
I have no idea how Dad stayed so
long with you, I honestly don't.

23:33.857 --> 23:35.497
- Vincent, shut up. That's enough.
- No, no!

23:35.697 --> 23:37.497
I don't know how to
get it through to you.

23:37.697 --> 23:40.317
I'm not your project, Mum! Get a
bloody hobby and leave me alone!

23:45.537 --> 23:47.537
Feel better?

23:47.677 --> 23:49.697
Mum.

23:51.437 --> 23:52.897
Mum!

23:54.737 --> 23:56.617
Where are you going?

23:56.757 --> 23:58.897
Mum, are you OK?

24:00.457 --> 24:03.057
- He hates me.
- No, he doesn't hate you.

24:03.257 --> 24:06.417
No, he just... he's got
so much frustration in him.

24:06.557 --> 24:08.497
He doesn't know where to put it all.

24:08.637 --> 24:10.697
He's gone home now,

24:10.897 --> 24:14.097
so just leave him alone for
a little while to calm down.

24:14.597 --> 24:18.000
I know I should be grateful

24:18.301 --> 24:21.244
that he didn't die.

24:21.247 --> 24:23.957
And I am, of course I am.

24:24.157 --> 24:29.017
And I know it makes me
selfish and greedy and pitiful,

24:29.157 --> 24:32.657
but... I miss my boy.

24:32.797 --> 24:35.017
I miss the way he was.

24:35.217 --> 24:37.697
What kind of a mother does that make me?

24:37.837 --> 24:39.977
An honest one.

24:40.177 --> 24:43.417
What if I let him go and
he gets even more hurt?

24:43.617 --> 24:48.257
He could, Mum. But so
could I. So could any of us.

24:50.397 --> 24:52.977
You can't protect him forever.

24:59.317 --> 25:04.182
Hey. You've gotta let him move out, Mum.

25:04.869 --> 25:05.857
Yeah.

25:08.291 --> 25:10.411
- Ah.
- Come on.

25:14.421 --> 25:15.981
Yeah, I responded to that email.

25:16.181 --> 25:19.061
They think it's gonna be too
political, but it won't be.

25:19.261 --> 25:21.821
The tone will be upbeat and energetic.

25:23.641 --> 25:28.381
Yep. Hey, can I call you back
in a little bit? Thanks. Thanks.

25:31.541 --> 25:35.381
So, I've, ah... I've been
thinking about your offer,

25:35.521 --> 25:37.421
your very kind offer.

25:37.621 --> 25:40.381
Have you also been reflecting
on your personal conduct?

25:40.581 --> 25:42.981
Greatly, and not just
my conduct for yesterday,

25:43.181 --> 25:44.921
but for all the years
that I've known you.

25:45.041 --> 25:47.141
And what conclusions have you drawn?

25:47.281 --> 25:48.981
Well, the main takeaways are that

25:49.181 --> 25:51.461
you've always been
right, about everything.

25:51.661 --> 25:56.538
And that everyone in my life, your
life, possibly the entire planet,

25:56.623 --> 25:58.021
would be greatly improved

25:58.221 --> 26:00.101
if everyone just
listened to you all along.

26:01.162 --> 26:02.221
So, is the job still on offer?

26:02.421 --> 26:05.421
Pete, tomorrow is the biggest
day of my career to date.

26:05.621 --> 26:08.781
- I know.
- If you fuck it up, I will kill you.

26:10.541 --> 26:13.021
Will you support my baby after my death?

26:13.221 --> 26:16.101
- Maybe.
- Mightn't be such a bad outcome.

26:53.942 --> 26:55.706
Oh my God, do you ever sleep.

26:55.715 --> 26:58.080
I can't even comprehend
how nervous you must be.

26:59.955 --> 27:01.432
Lily here's the breakdown.

27:01.808 --> 27:03.469
- It's going to be a great show.
- Fantastic.

27:05.532 --> 27:08.895
Hey. I'd give you a hug, but
probably wouldn't be appropriate, eh?

27:11.977 --> 27:12.977
Hi.

27:18.037 --> 27:19.809
- Did you get the email?
- Yep.

27:19.841 --> 27:21.375
- Have you read the breakdown?
- Yes.

27:21.571 --> 27:23.371
Just remind me, which host is he again?

27:23.475 --> 27:24.475
I'm just kidding.

27:24.501 --> 27:26.079
Today I'm not gonna
laugh at your jokes, Pete.

27:26.110 --> 27:27.864
- Sound like a challenge.
- No, it's not a challenge.

27:27.881 --> 27:28.598
- Really?
- Shut up.

27:28.599 --> 27:29.516
- You OK?
- Yeah.

27:29.541 --> 27:30.346
You seem stressed.

27:30.358 --> 27:33.034
- You must be Eric's brain.
- Ah, Pete.

27:33.542 --> 27:35.742
- Nice to meet you Pete.
- You too.

27:36.136 --> 27:39.028
- Where is Syria?
- Uh, the Middle East.

27:39.646 --> 27:41.834
Ah it borders the Mediterranean Sea,

27:41.835 --> 27:45.540
Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, Iraq and...

27:45.921 --> 27:48.246
Jordan. Why is dredging problematic?

27:48.453 --> 27:52.509
Uh, it obliterates the sea bed
floor, it kills marine wildlife,

27:52.510 --> 27:53.992
it's a major threat to
the Great Barrier Reef.

27:54.001 --> 27:56.551
What year did Eric win the Gold Logie?

27:57.396 --> 27:58.122
Ah!

27:58.154 --> 28:00.322
Alas, that's probably the
only answer you need to know.

28:00.338 --> 28:01.338
Good luck.

28:03.752 --> 28:04.463
You'll be fine.

28:06.753 --> 28:07.495
What year was it?

28:07.808 --> 28:09.408
Yeah.

28:10.566 --> 28:13.887
Hi, Eric, I just wanted to
introduce you to Pete Barnett.

28:13.899 --> 28:15.828
He is going to be
working with you today.

28:16.774 --> 28:19.662
Ah, yes of course welcome,
come on in, please take a seat.

28:19.674 --> 28:20.655
Thanks.

28:20.663 --> 28:21.866
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

28:22.465 --> 28:25.230
First foray into the
televisual world then?

28:25.239 --> 28:26.808
Ah yeah it is.

28:26.878 --> 28:28.183
All a bit overwhelming I imagine.

28:28.214 --> 28:29.158
Ah!

28:29.542 --> 28:31.484
You know what the biggest
challenge is going to be

28:31.547 --> 28:34.742
just keeping up with me to be honest.

28:34.750 --> 28:38.210
Right. Well any advice you
can give is more than welcome.

28:38.367 --> 28:44.895
Well, first and foremost: do not
repeat, do not try to imitate me.

28:44.934 --> 28:47.924
My speech pattern, my rhythm.

28:48.737 --> 28:51.432
If you will and honestly
save yourself the heartache.

28:52.057 --> 28:55.524
In other words do not
try to write "Eric gags".

28:55.760 --> 29:00.813
Oh right, I sorta thought
that was the general idea.

29:00.838 --> 29:03.696
- It's no no no no no no...
- No.

29:03.712 --> 29:05.844
- That's that's what I do.
- Great OK.

29:06.259 --> 29:09.102
Pete, you feed me the data.

29:09.595 --> 29:12.176
The facts, the stats, the who,
the where, the what, the why.

29:13.075 --> 29:14.608
You bring me the world.

29:15.325 --> 29:18.090
I put it through the magic
Eric filter add the funny and...

29:19.927 --> 29:21.094
spin it into gold.

29:21.095 --> 29:22.095
- Brilliant.
- Absolutely.

29:27.480 --> 29:28.639
And welcome back...

29:28.671 --> 29:31.617
- Well, have you heard of cosmetic...
- We're coming back to him

29:31.618 --> 29:34.460
- on camera two, so ready and...
- What about the Brazilian butt lift?

29:34.465 --> 29:35.991
- Camera 2. On one.
- I know, right.

29:36.008 --> 29:37.747
Coming up soon we'll
hear about the latest

29:37.748 --> 29:40.743
- and strangest cosmetic surgery fads...
- Cosmetic surgery

29:40.750 --> 29:43.165
actually went up 10%
this last year alone.

29:43.220 --> 29:45.258
- But first, Erica?
- Cross to Erica.

29:45.280 --> 29:46.037
Camera 3.

29:46.061 --> 29:48.703
It's the controversial report
that has everyone talking.

29:48.704 --> 29:51.036
The Dalgaard Foundation
released a paper this week

29:51.039 --> 29:55.121
listing some benefits for children
raised by same sex couples.

29:55.645 --> 29:57.718
- And...into the package.
- It's our Talking Point this morning.

29:57.727 --> 30:00.160
"A ground breaking study has found that

30:00.172 --> 30:03.038
- children of same sex parents actually... "
- Great, can we...

30:03.063 --> 30:05.956
Pete, Pete, I think Eric
wants you quickly on the floor.

30:06.016 --> 30:08.251
Paul? What's his name, Pete?

30:08.392 --> 30:10.021
I can almost sniff a Walkley,

30:10.046 --> 30:12.474
but it's consumed by the
aroma of Red Carpet Round-Ups

30:12.475 --> 30:14.170
and Home-Shopping Bargains.

30:14.177 --> 30:18.121
- Hey, sorry about that last stat before.
- It's fine. It's all fine.

30:18.176 --> 30:20.515
- I could use a bit, a bit of...
- What's that?

30:20.726 --> 30:23.784
Substance. Detail, seasoning...

30:24.380 --> 30:27.473
- All of that. All of that. All of that.
- All right. Sorry, sorry.

30:28.013 --> 30:30.479
According to experts,
gay couples are generally

30:30.573 --> 30:32.699
better prepared to have children and...

30:32.707 --> 30:34.435
So, how... how's it going?

30:34.694 --> 30:36.294
This is a stark contrast...

30:37.642 --> 30:38.779
Same as all the other shows.

30:39.680 --> 30:40.980
I don't know if that's a good thing.

30:42.203 --> 30:43.843
Two minutes till the cooking segment.

30:44.516 --> 30:46.357
Jack, 2 minutes. You all good?

30:46.373 --> 30:52.638
- Yep.
- OK, in 5, 4, 3, 2.

30:53.236 --> 30:57.241
Well some food for thought there.
What's your take on it Eric?

30:57.577 --> 31:00.617
Well I've gotta say, as
a devoted dad myself...

31:00.633 --> 31:02.152
Oh God, brace yourself.

31:02.168 --> 31:05.768
I get why people are
uncomfortable with a report that

31:05.793 --> 31:09.258
well kinda brushes fathers
to the side a bit, doesn't it?

31:09.725 --> 31:13.092
The report is about same
sex parents of both genders.

31:13.108 --> 31:15.375
- I realise that.
- So in some cases, families who have not one

31:15.414 --> 31:16.507
but two fathers.

31:16.969 --> 31:21.595
But I think you'll find... it's
predominantly lesbians, Erica.

31:22.689 --> 31:25.649
Over a third of lesbians are
parents versus 1-in-10 gay men.

31:26.009 --> 31:26.768
As a matter of fact,

31:26.834 --> 31:29.574
I think you'll find that a
third of lesbians in Australia

31:29.628 --> 31:33.026
have children as opposed
to just 1-in-10 gay men.

31:33.051 --> 31:34.391
That's a pretty big difference, Erica.

31:34.416 --> 31:37.427
- That's a pretty big difference.
- It's getting a bit not fun.

31:37.435 --> 31:40.876
- No, it's good.
- OK, Sasha would probably be stepping in,

31:40.909 --> 31:41.940
but whatever.

31:42.003 --> 31:43.476
And ultimately what
we're talking about here

31:43.555 --> 31:46.088
is a generation of kids
who don't have fathers.

31:46.157 --> 31:48.912
Eric, that's a ridiculous exaggeration.

31:49.149 --> 31:51.262
Listen, don't get me
wrong, I love gay people.

31:51.301 --> 31:52.465
That's a good start, go on...

31:52.473 --> 31:54.349
If I could just get half
a sentence out, Erica.

31:54.381 --> 31:57.262
- I'd be going to Jack but... Just saying.
- I love gay people,

31:57.301 --> 31:58.735
I love their children
and I support them.

31:58.805 --> 32:01.055
I will go to their parties, I
will pose with their selfies...

32:01.072 --> 32:02.985
Great, I'm sure they're
thrilled by that.

32:03.009 --> 32:04.501
You know what, I will never say...

32:04.533 --> 32:07.410
That kids that grow up without
a dad aren't disadvantaged.

32:07.489 --> 32:11.590
- OK Eric, bring it down.
- Oh look I'm sorry I am, but they are,

32:11.599 --> 32:14.848
it's a compromise and those
children are compromised.

32:14.864 --> 32:18.314
Actually if you look at any academic
study in the scientific journals

32:18.346 --> 32:19.489
then that's not true.

32:19.505 --> 32:21.761
Erica, we're gonna just...

32:21.960 --> 32:23.070
- Oh my God!
- Really?

32:23.094 --> 32:23.968
Uh?

32:24.031 --> 32:26.814
Come on, this... this is
not like all the other shows.

32:26.869 --> 32:29.194
- Eric?
- Mature response, very professional.

32:29.211 --> 32:32.109
Eric? The camera is still
on you. I need you to fill.

32:32.148 --> 32:34.245
You need to fill.
You're still on screen.

32:34.378 --> 32:36.631
You could just say, uh...

32:36.648 --> 32:37.714
You know what?

32:38.736 --> 32:39.501
Fine!

32:39.557 --> 32:41.845
- Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!
- What's the call?

32:41.847 --> 32:42.862
- Um...
- Go to Jack.

32:42.894 --> 32:45.621
No we can't go to Jack. He
doesn't have anyone to talk to.

32:45.637 --> 32:48.316
- Where is the back up package?
- I have David Hasselhoff's obituary.

32:48.333 --> 32:50.142
He's not dead yet. Go to a commercial.

32:50.158 --> 32:52.110
- It's too soon.
- Upstairs is ringing.

32:52.119 --> 32:54.767
We could be doing Summer
Accessories right now.

32:54.830 --> 32:56.733
Lily, I need a decision.
What are we throwing to?

32:56.781 --> 32:59.670
Throw to Hamilton. Hamilton, I
need you to pad for 2 minutes.

32:59.675 --> 33:00.947
We'll bring the weather forward.

33:02.291 --> 33:03.291
Well,

33:03.672 --> 33:04.589
hello.

33:04.782 --> 33:05.782
Good morning.

33:06.328 --> 33:08.062
You know I often get asked,

33:09.037 --> 33:12.480
"hey Hamilton, when'd your love
affair with meteorology begin?".

33:12.926 --> 33:16.391
Let me take you back to 1987.

33:16.663 --> 33:20.240
Hum... Stormy day, very
cumulus clouds around

33:20.265 --> 33:22.280
and there was a little clap of thunder.

33:22.288 --> 33:25.266
OK forget the pad, forget
the pad. Forecast and break.

33:25.359 --> 33:26.296
Let's forget about that.

33:26.304 --> 33:27.837
I'm gonna talk to Erica.

33:29.016 --> 33:31.688
I mean I was just feeding
statistics from the report.

33:31.727 --> 33:36.690
Yes and I needed statistics to
support my argument. Support.

33:36.700 --> 33:39.597
Seriously mate, if it
were me I'd just apologise.

33:39.621 --> 33:40.621
Really?

33:41.103 --> 33:45.103
I'm not the one that stormed
out off set. Well not first.

33:45.439 --> 33:47.106
You know what... I, I, I...

33:47.258 --> 33:49.921
you're not really getting
the brief here mate.

33:52.703 --> 33:53.816
Are you OK?

33:54.020 --> 33:57.087
- Sorry, Lily.
- No no, don't apologise please.

33:57.346 --> 33:58.564
So what's next?

33:58.573 --> 33:59.395
Jack in the kitchen?

33:59.399 --> 34:02.425
Yeah, we're on a break and then it
will be Jack in the kitchen unless...

34:02.785 --> 34:06.418
Do you want an opportunity to
respond to what just happened?

34:07.902 --> 34:09.797
- Not with Eric no.
- No no. No no no.

34:09.822 --> 34:13.089
You tell me what you'd
be comfortable with.

34:13.639 --> 34:16.230
I mean I have some
points I wanted to make.

34:16.967 --> 34:18.965
Oh. I just don't want to do
a monologue down the camera.

34:18.989 --> 34:20.254
What if it was a conversation?

34:22.228 --> 34:26.029
- They won't like it... Upstairs.
- I'm happy to own it.

34:29.578 --> 34:30.777
OK, who would I be speaking to?

34:34.511 --> 34:36.574
OK, before we do the kitchen segment.

34:36.598 --> 34:38.895
I want you to have an
on-air discussion with Erica

34:38.896 --> 34:40.196
about what just happened.

34:40.353 --> 34:41.353
What?

34:41.369 --> 34:43.672
I want to give her an
opportunity to respond,

34:43.697 --> 34:45.594
and she'd rather do
it as a conversation.

34:45.641 --> 34:47.388
Are you sure we wouldn't be
better off just dropping it?

34:47.389 --> 34:48.569
It's clearly very emotional.

34:48.574 --> 34:51.342
It'll be fine. With the
two of you, it will be fine,

34:51.382 --> 34:53.011
- I'm not a host, Lily.
- I know that.

34:53.018 --> 34:57.286
But you are more than capable.
I will feed you the questions.

34:57.809 --> 35:00.609
- I'm just a cooking guy.
- Jack, please.

35:01.008 --> 35:02.820
You're all I have right now.

35:05.950 --> 35:08.385
- OK.
- Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.

35:13.417 --> 35:14.737
- Ten seconds.
- OK. Sorry.

35:14.746 --> 35:18.236
Hot Cat-oure, the Adelaide woman
who makes formal wear for your cats.

35:18.259 --> 35:20.126
No, we're going to Jack
straight after the break.

35:20.158 --> 35:21.853
Camera 2, close on Jack and stay there.

35:21.884 --> 35:25.618
Hey Jack. I need you to get
on set and work to camera 2.

35:25.631 --> 35:28.339
Upstairs has already
approved Hot Cat-oure.

35:28.347 --> 35:29.534
They were quite firm about it.

35:29.550 --> 35:35.794
We're going to Jack in 4, 3, 2, 1...

35:36.423 --> 35:38.998
- Welcome back everyone.
- Well welcome back everyone.

35:39.030 --> 35:43.148
We are coming to you 100% live,
and as you may have noticed,

35:43.165 --> 35:45.086
things haven't gone
exactly according to plan...

35:45.110 --> 35:46.777
Good, that's really good.

35:47.600 --> 35:48.824
- Just...
- Just a few minutes ago,

35:48.856 --> 35:50.699
we were in the middle of
our talking point segment.

35:50.707 --> 35:51.871
And it got a bit heated.

35:52.692 --> 35:55.026
A bit emotional between our two hosts.

35:55.036 --> 35:56.715
And they both stepped off
the stage for a moment.

35:56.739 --> 35:59.069
- And just before we go...
- Erica's travelling. She just left makeup.

35:59.079 --> 36:01.848
- ... The things said by our host, Eric,
- 30 seconds, Jack.

36:01.947 --> 36:02.947
or by both our hosts,

36:03.171 --> 36:06.686
don't reflect the show or any of us
working on it and certainly not me.

36:06.859 --> 36:10.398
And funnily enough, I'm just
here to cook a pumpkin feta salad.

36:10.641 --> 36:11.842
She's back, she's on set.

36:11.866 --> 36:13.569
OK, welcome Erica back on set.

36:13.577 --> 36:16.104
So joining me now is our host, Erica.

36:18.034 --> 36:22.065
- Firstly Erica, how are you?
- I'm fine thank you.

36:22.677 --> 36:26.169
Uh, I'm sorry everyone at home
for my sudden departure there.

36:26.863 --> 36:31.196
Obviously we cover a broad
range of topics here on the show.

36:31.252 --> 36:32.883
And some of them hit
closer to home than I want.

36:32.915 --> 36:34.238
Ask her if she wants to reflect.

36:34.246 --> 36:35.541
Is there anything you'd like to add?

36:35.542 --> 36:36.842
You were a bit cut off there before.

36:37.243 --> 36:38.143
Uh...

36:38.438 --> 36:40.274
I don't generally talk
about my private life.

36:41.928 --> 36:45.128
But I am a proud lesbian woman.

36:45.153 --> 36:47.684
I am in a loving long term relationship.

36:48.477 --> 36:51.352
And I think that is the perspective
I brought to the segment earlier.

36:51.508 --> 36:54.031
What is this now? Oprah.

36:54.040 --> 36:55.241
I just want to say that Eric

36:55.687 --> 37:00.093
has... has always been incredibly
accepting and generous to me

37:00.117 --> 37:03.505
- and to my partner, to Carol.
- I have.

37:03.530 --> 37:06.678
But as someone who is really
looking forward to having children

37:07.217 --> 37:08.983
some of the things that he said,

37:10.686 --> 37:14.700
- and I guess his choice of words...
- Struck a nerve.

37:15.458 --> 37:16.313
And that's right.

37:17.427 --> 37:18.995
But don't worry viewers,

37:19.276 --> 37:20.343
we'll be fine.

37:20.962 --> 37:23.828
We'll sort it out, cause we always do.

37:25.428 --> 37:28.161
On that matter Erica, can
I interest you in a salad?

37:29.185 --> 37:31.901
You know Jack, I could not
think of anything better.

37:34.019 --> 37:36.713
Oh, that is really really good.

37:36.738 --> 37:39.433
- Camera 2.
- Oh my God, over feels.

37:39.450 --> 37:41.762
Alright guys. Well what a show.

37:51.099 --> 37:52.233
Are you alright?

37:52.412 --> 37:55.221
Yes. Pretty much everyone
I've ever met is messaging me.

37:55.230 --> 37:56.197
What are they saying?

37:56.228 --> 38:00.922
Oh... Congratulations. Why did
it take so long? We love you.

38:02.967 --> 38:03.967
Oh.

38:04.670 --> 38:05.670
Mum.

38:06.050 --> 38:07.050
Hi.

38:08.498 --> 38:10.990
We are number the
number 1, 3 and 8 trends

38:10.998 --> 38:13.283
and seriously half of Twitter
wants to have Jack's baby.

38:13.307 --> 38:14.907
Do you know where he is?

38:16.180 --> 38:18.095
Here she is. Craig! Hi, I...

38:18.103 --> 38:19.718
Did you make that call back there?

38:20.438 --> 38:22.937
Yes. I thought it was better
to stick to the story...

38:23.039 --> 38:24.898
That was a great save, keep it up.

38:29.028 --> 38:30.028
Hey, um...

38:30.669 --> 38:32.453
Obviously we're going to need a full

38:32.454 --> 38:34.964
and thorough debrief about today.

38:35.290 --> 38:36.391
- Absolutely.
- Great.

38:38.326 --> 38:41.073
Also, that Pete fellow,

38:42.282 --> 38:43.579
I don't think he's gonna work out.

38:55.819 --> 38:57.350
Well, I can't say I'm surprised.

38:57.366 --> 39:00.081
He did only say two of the
things I suggested in 3 hours.

39:00.215 --> 39:03.015
If it makes you feel better,
he has a poor little taste.

39:05.753 --> 39:08.187
But the sad thing is I was
kinda drinking the Kool-aid.

39:08.696 --> 39:10.899
Um... Maybe got into
the red carpet around...

39:10.907 --> 39:11.644
Shut up!

39:11.652 --> 39:14.101
No I did, I mean you gotta
salute the bold colour choice.

39:14.132 --> 39:16.783
And whoever said you can't wear red
on a red carpet, that's plain wrong.

39:16.799 --> 39:17.789
Right?

39:20.041 --> 39:25.546
Plus... Watching you, you were
kind of electric being the boss.

39:26.101 --> 39:29.168
- That was pure panic.
- Well, it suits you.

39:35.213 --> 39:37.946
- I just... I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

39:41.052 --> 39:42.737
- Hi.
- Hey.

39:43.237 --> 39:44.904
Ah, it's Nikkii, wasn't it?

39:44.995 --> 39:48.134
You have four different
colour tones in your beard.

39:48.229 --> 39:49.495
I've been counting.

39:51.355 --> 39:52.355
OK...

39:55.769 --> 39:56.769
Coming in?

39:59.808 --> 40:02.039
I just wanted to say
well done for today.

40:02.957 --> 40:04.541
Gotta live TV.

40:04.933 --> 40:07.003
- Sink or swim.
- You swam.

40:07.371 --> 40:08.371
Thanks to you.

40:09.826 --> 40:13.854
You feel good, you're really
good. You should dream big.

40:14.034 --> 40:17.166
Maybe... even bigger
than that cooking guy.

40:18.325 --> 40:21.473
Look, just ah... about
everything with Simone...

40:22.122 --> 40:26.729
I... you know I want to apologise
again for not telling you the truth.

40:26.737 --> 40:28.581
That was, it was inexcusable.

40:28.628 --> 40:33.451
I was angry, I was confused
about a lot of things.

40:35.365 --> 40:37.004
I took it out on you
and I shouldn't have.

40:40.496 --> 40:42.817
It's all been a bit of a mess, really.

40:45.765 --> 40:47.147
But I want to be honest.

40:49.437 --> 40:52.031
If I'm honest, I've been confused.

40:53.515 --> 40:55.366
- By my feelings.
- Stop.

40:57.417 --> 40:58.417
Don't.

41:01.831 --> 41:03.231
You're dating Simone.

41:04.625 --> 41:06.425
I am not any more actually.

41:07.992 --> 41:09.248
Oh then really don't.

41:12.451 --> 41:14.665
If you, if you had feelings for me

41:14.666 --> 41:16.375
why would you go out
with my best friend?

41:19.018 --> 41:20.664
It happened... slowly.

41:24.332 --> 41:25.332
I'm sorry.

41:31.247 --> 41:33.042
Ellen was thin, but,

41:33.043 --> 41:35.045
it just wasn't really
relevant to her brand.

41:35.402 --> 41:36.502
You know what I mean?

41:38.003 --> 41:38.905
You know what I mean?

41:38.949 --> 41:39.949
Yes.

41:41.449 --> 41:44.285
I can't... I can't kiss you back.

42:20.298 --> 42:22.977
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:26.880 --> 42:28.347
Jack broke up with me.

42:33.220 --> 42:34.400
I'm really sorry, Sim.

42:34.447 --> 42:37.603
I don't deserve any pity, I'm just...

42:38.703 --> 42:40.370
feeling sorry for myself.

42:45.122 --> 42:47.954
I admire you... You
were friends with me.

42:58.534 --> 43:01.502
Because in year one,

43:01.903 --> 43:04.475
when Angela Tobaro pulled my hair,

43:04.787 --> 43:06.667
you pushed her away.

43:09.034 --> 43:10.171
And in year 11,

43:11.742 --> 43:14.960
when I entered that really
bad joke-telling contest,

43:16.117 --> 43:18.383
you laughed so hard,

43:18.501 --> 43:22.634
that it drowned out the deafening
silence of everyone else in the room.

43:25.519 --> 43:30.182
And when I was studying at
uni, and I had not one cent,

43:30.573 --> 43:34.440
you paid for my tickets so that
I could see the White Stripes.

43:37.368 --> 43:39.252
If you really loved me,

43:41.323 --> 43:43.390
you'll get in the bath with me.

43:57.883 --> 43:58.883
I love you, Lil.
