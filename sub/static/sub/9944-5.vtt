00:24.580 --> 00:26.935
Cos this, people reckon -
me included -

00:27.020 --> 00:29.488
is why pubs and drugs

00:29.580 --> 00:31.172
were kindly invented...

00:31.260 --> 00:33.774
To calm us all down
and stop us going mental.

00:33.860 --> 00:38.570
These are Chatsworth Estate's

02:00.460 --> 02:05.136
- Leave. They're for the voters.
- Oh, beg your pardon!

02:05.220 --> 02:06.892
- Chatsworth's getting a mayor.
- A young mayor,

02:06.980 --> 02:09.175
elected for the kids by the kids.

02:12.060 --> 02:14.176
- Yeah?

02:14.260 --> 02:18.253
Debbie wants to know
if you're coming canvassing.

02:19.500 --> 02:21.968
Later. I've got stuff to do first.

02:24.460 --> 02:26.735
Oi! You'll go blind.

02:28.940 --> 02:31.659
So Debs, why aren't you running?

02:31.740 --> 02:32.934

02:43.700 --> 02:45.930
Long <i>and</i> wide.

02:46.020 --> 02:48.329
Chesney is the perfect candidate.

02:48.420 --> 02:53.255
He's smart, cute, clean-cut
and he's got something to say for himself.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.808
Asian, male...

02:55.900 --> 03:01.293
Right. But I thought candidates
had to be charismatic.

03:01.380 --> 03:03.848
Chesney can do charisma.
Come to the hustings, yeah?

03:03.940 --> 03:06.170
He's gonna knock
everyone off the podium.

03:09.860 --> 03:12.215

Is he around, Yvonne?

03:36.540 --> 03:37.893
He's at school, in't he?

03:37.980 --> 03:40.733
We're not in school

04:15.540 --> 04:17.815
Just trying to hide a few pounds.

04:17.899 --> 04:18.969
Of what? Explosives?

04:19.060 --> 04:22.052
We're not all terrorists, Debbie.
It's research.

04:22.140 --> 04:24.893

Have you learned your speech?
You're on in ten.

04:29.940 --> 04:31.851
Sort of. I thought we'd wing it.

04:31.940 --> 04:35.410
Chesney, you cannot <i>wing</i> it.
It's too important.

04:35.500 --> 04:37.138
Why d'you want this so much anyway?

04:37.220 --> 04:38.972
It costs 62 quid a week
to feed our lot.

04:39.060 --> 04:41.369
If we grew our own spuds,
we could cut that in half.

04:41.460 --> 04:44.736
And I don't trust anyone else to do
anything good with that ten grand.

04:44.820 --> 04:47.209
Relax, I've got a plan.

04:47.300 --> 04:49.097

Well, I'm gonna change that.

13:26.060 --> 13:28.369
I'll do a refresher course
on the Highway Code.

13:28.460 --> 13:30.769
We were in the van.
You're not allowed to drive it.

13:30.860 --> 13:32.134
Shit.

13:32.220 --> 13:33.653
Shit!

13:35.340 --> 13:36.295
You are, though.

13:36.380 --> 13:39.497
No chance. No!

13:39.580 --> 13:41.172
Why should I take the rap for it?

13:41.260 --> 13:43.490
- Because you're the only one who can.
- No.

13:43.580 --> 13:46.140
The times he's covered for us!
Come on!

13:46.220 --> 13:47.972
What's the musketeer motto?

13:48.060 --> 13:50.210
"I'm all for looking after myself"?

13:50.300 --> 13:54.851
You know, I still haven't given my account
of that incident in custody last week,

13:54.940 --> 13:58.330
when you rubbed your man's face
in his own dirty protest.

13:58.420 --> 14:00.854
Serious breach of his civil rights.

14:02.700 --> 14:05.214
- Come here, you!
- Aaaahh!

14:08.340 --> 14:10.649
If you squash 'em,
they'll spread eggs.

14:10.740 --> 14:12.412
Next thing, you're infested.

14:18.780 --> 14:21.658
- Aaaahhh!
- Shut up!

14:25.180 --> 14:26.579
No!

14:36.260 --> 14:41.573
Half a dozen fags
and a packet of the lager and lime, ta.

15:01.460 --> 15:04.975
Shift!
New laws, adults allowed.

15:05.060 --> 15:06.288
(Girl) What?!

15:06.380 --> 15:08.098
Come on, girls.

15:13.340 --> 15:15.058
I put him in't bin.

15:15.140 --> 15:16.858
Cockroach.

15:17.700 --> 15:21.329
I weren't sure where they hang out,
so I just thought cockroach,

15:21.420 --> 15:23.012
filthy,

15:23.100 --> 15:24.738
bin.

15:29.060 --> 15:31.449
If anyone had the balls
to drop the bomb,

15:31.540 --> 15:33.576
cockroaches would be
all that's left.

15:35.340 --> 15:37.570
It's the shell.

15:37.660 --> 15:40.299
Shields them from radiation.

15:40.380 --> 15:42.416
How d'you know all that?

15:42.500 --> 15:44.411
I've lived in some holes.

15:44.500 --> 15:46.456
Known the odd pest-controller.

15:49.740 --> 15:50.695
Right!

15:50.780 --> 15:52.771
Back to work, then.

15:57.820 --> 15:59.617
Shane.

15:59.700 --> 16:01.133
Kelly.

16:03.060 --> 16:05.016
Are you busy later?

16:05.100 --> 16:07.136
I never stop, love.

16:07.220 --> 16:09.529
Why? Fancy buying us a drink?

16:09.620 --> 16:13.738
- Yeah, if you're...
- I'm sure I can slip you in!

16:16.260 --> 16:18.490
Hey, knobhead!
Watch where the sand's going!

16:26.500 --> 16:27.455
No!

16:27.540 --> 16:30.259
Oi, little man! What you doing?

16:30.340 --> 16:31.534
Stop it!

16:33.180 --> 16:37.776
Oi, you little...
I will rip your...

16:37.860 --> 16:41.296
What? You gonna give us a slap?

16:41.380 --> 16:43.336
You think you're
a big girl now, yeah?

16:43.420 --> 16:45.172
Think you can take me on?

16:49.260 --> 16:50.693
Move!

16:52.940 --> 16:54.896
Right...

16:54.980 --> 16:58.450
Bring back the beer
and, this once, I'll let it go.

16:59.540 --> 17:00.859
Oh!

17:00.940 --> 17:04.376
You butts on this. What happened?

17:04.460 --> 17:05.779
You was a pretty girl.

17:07.420 --> 17:09.694
Romeo, blood. You can stop now.

17:15.060 --> 17:17.619
SIREN

17:19.380 --> 17:20.574
You're off the hook.

17:20.660 --> 17:23.810
Just told the sarge that I bumped
the old dear, and he bought it.

17:23.900 --> 17:25.378
Carrie, I don't know what to say.

17:25.460 --> 17:26.733
Try saying some prayers,

17:26.819 --> 17:29.209
cos if I don't pass
this remedial driving test,

17:29.300 --> 17:33.418
you'll be owing me in the next life,
not just this one... mate!

17:37.860 --> 17:41.614
- Wasn't this a kids' beach once?
- OK, they weren't in the plan.

17:41.700 --> 17:45.488
But this place can only benefit
from having adults around.

17:45.580 --> 17:48.538
Hey!
Can I take a picture?

17:48.620 --> 17:49.609
Sure.

17:51.700 --> 17:54.009
Just want you to look your best.

17:55.100 --> 17:57.136
Thanks.

18:03.420 --> 18:06.492
(Mandy) It can be hard work, eh? Pulling.

18:06.580 --> 18:09.413
Who's pulling?
Just thought I'd make an effort.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.218
Right.

18:11.300 --> 18:12.699
Shame, though, looking like that.

18:12.780 --> 18:15.658
God, yeah! You'd clean up, girl!

18:18.300 --> 18:20.973
(Debbie) How do you know if a lad's,
like, genuinely into ya?

18:21.060 --> 18:23.255
He's not just telling you stuff
that you want to hear?

18:23.340 --> 18:27.299
- Make a move.
- You'll know soon enough.

18:27.380 --> 18:28.893
Right.

18:29.940 --> 18:34.536
Debbie, if he doesn't realise
how lucky he is, he's not worth it.

18:34.620 --> 18:36.611
Yeah.

18:38.780 --> 18:41.658
Sex on the beach?

18:41.740 --> 18:42.934
How about a punch?

18:47.140 --> 18:49.574
- Find me.
- Mm-hm.

18:51.620 --> 18:53.975
- I think I'm in there, Karen.
- Yeah?

18:54.060 --> 18:55.095
Mm.

18:55.180 --> 18:57.410
It's not gonna be cheap, mind.

18:57.500 --> 19:00.890
She's a bit old-fashioned about
putting her hand in her pocket.

19:00.980 --> 19:02.891
But not about sticking it in yours!

19:02.980 --> 19:03.969
Funny, that!

19:04.060 --> 19:05.459
Mm-hm.

19:05.540 --> 19:07.212
You're all a mystery to me.

19:08.380 --> 19:10.291
One of those, please, love.

19:10.380 --> 19:12.257
LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY

19:12.340 --> 19:14.171
(Karen) Want crisps with that?

19:19.420 --> 19:21.411
Your rent is extortionate!

19:21.500 --> 19:22.899
You're the only licensed franchiser

19:22.980 --> 19:26.017
in what's gonna be the number one
tourist attraction in town.

19:26.100 --> 19:27.852
D'you want in on the ground floor?

19:29.500 --> 19:30.899
LAUGHS

19:36.540 --> 19:38.292
You're all right.

19:45.780 --> 19:47.418
Your hand's shaking!

19:49.580 --> 19:50.899
First time?

19:50.980 --> 19:52.208
You what?

19:52.300 --> 19:53.289
No!

19:53.380 --> 19:55.052
I'm a man of the world, me, love.

19:55.140 --> 19:56.573
Right.

19:56.660 --> 19:59.333
Lillian! Found a friend!

19:59.420 --> 20:00.853
Oh, hiya, Shane, love!

20:00.940 --> 20:03.408
I'm just gonna
slip into something more comfy.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.053
Talk to t'gaffer.

20:06.140 --> 20:07.573
OK.

20:09.420 --> 20:12.059
Why?

20:12.140 --> 20:14.813
You're a whore?!

20:14.900 --> 20:16.094
A fuckin' prossie!

20:16.180 --> 20:19.411
What's Lillian been saying?

20:19.500 --> 20:24.733
Of course I'm a working girl!
Are you telling me you didn't know?

20:24.820 --> 20:28.335
Sorry, Kelly, love.
Shall I fetch Leroy?

20:28.420 --> 20:30.490
It's OK.

20:32.340 --> 20:35.969
You think I'm stupid.
Soft Shane - runt of the litter!

20:36.060 --> 20:37.254
Shane, I don't!

20:38.300 --> 20:41.258
Tiny bit naive maybe.

20:41.340 --> 20:45.333
I just... I thought when
we were at t'beach, it were good.

20:45.420 --> 20:47.411
It were.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.775
Just... a girl's gotta earn.

20:49.860 --> 20:51.851
How much?

20:51.940 --> 20:53.373
50!

20:53.460 --> 20:57.851
You can pay with cash, card,
giro, luncheon vouchers...

20:57.940 --> 20:59.373
Right.

21:03.420 --> 21:04.853
OK.

21:04.940 --> 21:06.658
Right.

21:13.820 --> 21:16.459
15.

21:18.580 --> 21:22.289
Please don't ask for credit,
as a refusal may cause offence.

21:22.380 --> 21:24.257
I'll get it. I'll get it.

21:24.340 --> 21:25.773
Just, erm...

21:25.860 --> 21:27.134
Here y'are.

21:30.500 --> 21:32.138
Hold that thought, yeah?

21:36.460 --> 21:37.529
Anybody waiting?

21:39.260 --> 21:42.935
<i>Because my lonely heart would bleed</i>

21:43.300 --> 21:47.179
<i>I never learned how to hold love</i>

21:47.260 --> 21:49.569
<i>And stay strong to love</i>

21:49.660 --> 21:53.812
<i>Now I close my eyes now</i>

21:53.900 --> 21:58.416
<i>And I'm dreamin'</i>
<i>right where I belong...</i>

22:08.060 --> 22:10.654
SCREAMING

22:10.740 --> 22:13.254
You think you're a big girl now, yeah?

22:13.340 --> 22:15.854
Come on! Jump up and get down!

22:15.940 --> 22:18.659
Come on, Debbie, dance with me!

22:18.740 --> 22:20.458
You should be taking it easy!

22:20.540 --> 22:22.895
Knock it off! I have juice.

22:22.980 --> 22:25.414
Hey, it's like Corfu
all over again, in't it?

22:26.940 --> 22:29.010
Disco, ouzo,

22:29.100 --> 22:30.772
dancing till the sun comes up.

22:30.860 --> 22:33.932
Monica, it was Lesbos.

22:34.020 --> 22:36.614
It was a pebbled beach,
and it rained every day!

22:36.700 --> 22:38.133
Woo!

22:38.220 --> 22:43.499
<i>I'm a dreamer...</i>

22:47.140 --> 22:50.849
Norma, that is why.
Dreamer! Killjoy!

22:50.940 --> 22:52.293
Debbie.

22:52.380 --> 22:56.578
Look, this is all down to her.
Her and her little friend.

22:56.660 --> 22:59.811
It wasn't.
He's not my little friend either.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.219
Go and get a seat.

23:01.300 --> 23:03.655
All right, but don't
I have to pay Chesney?

23:03.740 --> 23:05.492
No, you do not!

23:05.580 --> 23:07.536
Over there.

23:14.780 --> 23:15.769
Shane!

23:17.020 --> 23:18.214
What you doing?

23:18.300 --> 23:19.858
What?

23:19.940 --> 23:21.453
Er, doing?

23:21.540 --> 23:23.849
What the fuck does it look like?!

23:23.940 --> 23:27.728
The man's burnt his back!
Bastard global warming!

23:29.980 --> 23:31.971
- Mate, can you sub us some cash?
- What for?

23:32.060 --> 23:34.893
What's it matter what for?
You know I'm good for it.

23:34.980 --> 23:36.208
One'll do.

23:42.540 --> 23:45.054
Cheers, bruv. Lifesaver.

No.

24:18.940 --> 24:19.895
Oi!

24:23.460 --> 24:24.688
LAUGHING

24:24.780 --> 24:27.374
I can do this in front of them!

24:33.900 --> 24:35.811
First day in and you're already bent.

24:35.900 --> 24:38.733
Whatever's left! I'm not
letting you feather your nest.

24:38.820 --> 24:40.253
Easy, Debbie.

24:40.340 --> 24:42.251
No! Easy is how you've had it so far!

24:42.340 --> 24:44.535
So you give donations to that granny!

24:44.620 --> 24:47.259
What granny? Who? Mrs Syad?

24:47.340 --> 24:49.729
We're hiring her paddling pool.

24:49.820 --> 24:53.017
Whatever. From now on,
we spend that money on what we said.

24:53.100 --> 24:56.456
Clear off! You're like a wife,
on my back, nipping my head!

24:56.540 --> 24:58.212
- We made a deal!
- No.

24:58.300 --> 25:00.894
You had plans,
and I encouraged you at every stage,

25:00.980 --> 25:04.609
I thought you'd get me the robes.
But you couldn't even do that!

25:04.700 --> 25:06.099
What?! Shut up!

25:06.180 --> 25:08.648
I worked my arse off
to get you in there. <i>I did that!</i>

25:08.740 --> 25:12.733
Did you fuck! I rigged the vote!
You think free scran swung it?

25:12.820 --> 25:15.539
I hired some muscle
to make kids vote for me.

25:15.620 --> 25:16.894
Just give me what I'm owed, yeah?

25:16.980 --> 25:18.538
Piss off! I owe you jack.

25:18.620 --> 25:21.851
You're not getting your hens,
your chips, or me!

25:23.860 --> 25:26.215
Yeah, I know.
You're so obvious, it's untrue.

25:26.300 --> 25:28.894

26:01.340 --> 26:02.898
Liquor, pills or porn?

26:02.980 --> 26:05.050
Pharmaceuticals usually do it.

26:07.300 --> 26:08.699
Oh...

26:09.740 --> 26:11.173
Oh, no, it's OK.

26:11.260 --> 26:13.330
No, it's all right.
I know what it's like.

What you afraid of?

26:21.460 --> 26:22.575
It's not your problem.

Well, give me a shout if...

28:24.460 --> 28:27.975
Yeah, I know. I got played.

28:28.060 --> 28:29.493
I'm sorry.

28:36.060 --> 28:37.891
Debbie!

28:37.980 --> 28:39.572
Come on, this isn't you.

28:39.660 --> 28:43.175
I hide away and feel sorry for meself.

28:43.260 --> 28:47.492
Eh? Me. Hey, you've not got a can
under there, have you?

28:47.580 --> 28:49.218
Cos that is a slippery slope...

28:52.940 --> 28:55.454
OK.

28:55.540 --> 28:58.737
OK, you didn't
realise that Chesney was a bastard.

28:58.820 --> 29:01.732
You got too close and your little heart's in bits.

29:01.820 --> 29:04.414
Shut up. I don't fancy Chesney.

29:04.500 --> 29:07.219
Not now. Back-stabbing user.

29:07.300 --> 29:10.531
All right, well, if you're not
gonna fight for him, the best way

29:10.620 --> 29:12.292
to get over that man is to show him.

29:12.380 --> 29:14.052
Life goes on. You had a dream.

29:14.140 --> 29:17.416
Egg and chips, feed the world.
Come on, make it happen!

29:17.500 --> 29:20.333
How can I? He's blown my budget.

29:20.420 --> 29:24.208
So? You're the queen of
getting by on the cheap.

29:24.300 --> 29:27.451
You are a doer,

29:27.540 --> 29:29.974
Debbie, not a...

29:30.060 --> 29:33.814
can't... er.

29:45.140 --> 29:46.573
OK.

29:48.300 --> 29:49.733
You're upset.

29:51.900 --> 29:53.333
It's hard.

29:55.460 --> 29:56.893
I know.

30:08.820 --> 30:10.970
SIGHS

30:30.100 --> 30:31.533
Debbie?

30:39.220 --> 30:40.494
Extra shot?

30:40.580 --> 30:43.697
No. Slept like a baby last night.

30:43.780 --> 30:46.931
Carrie? What is it?

30:47.020 --> 30:49.250
She's paralysed. The old woman.

30:49.340 --> 30:51.331
Wheelchair for the rest of her life.

30:51.420 --> 30:52.899
(Tom) Poor woman. That's terrible.

30:52.980 --> 30:56.097
It gets worse. The family are
taking legal action against <i>me.</i>

30:56.180 --> 30:58.933
I've been suspended!

30:59.020 --> 31:01.580
This changes things.
You've got to tell the sarge.

31:01.660 --> 31:05.016
I'm not gonna lose my warrant card
because of you, you blind idiot!

31:05.100 --> 31:08.217
Hey, let's keep our voices down
and think about this, OK?

31:08.300 --> 31:11.098
No, she's right. I have to bite the bullet.

31:11.180 --> 31:16.300
Wait! Stan... If you come clean about this now,

31:16.380 --> 31:17.893
you'll both be in the shit.

31:17.980 --> 31:22.451
It'll look like a conspiracy to cover up.
You'll both be sacked.

31:22.540 --> 31:24.496
I'm so sorry. You're a real mate.

31:24.580 --> 31:26.650
Don't think I did this out of friendship.

31:26.740 --> 31:30.176
I only covered for you because
D'Artagnan blackmailed me.

31:37.260 --> 31:40.058
Sorry, girls. Not today.

31:41.940 --> 31:43.532
Feeling it.

31:43.620 --> 31:45.815
The girl got game.

31:45.900 --> 31:47.219
Not my game.

31:47.300 --> 31:48.415
(Norma) Yvonne?

31:48.500 --> 31:50.650
Stay out of it, Norma.

31:53.900 --> 31:55.572
Fill it, and we'll be gone.

31:55.660 --> 31:57.616
Not a chance.

31:57.700 --> 32:01.454
You want me to funeral ya?
Fill it, or we mash you up.

32:01.540 --> 32:04.850
You? You couldn't mash a potato.

32:04.940 --> 32:06.896
Tell Bottom to jam the hype.

32:06.980 --> 32:10.655
Will you listen to yourself? You're all talk.

32:10.740 --> 32:12.059
Makes fuck all sense to me.

32:12.140 --> 32:14.779
Oh, I ain't no cork, blumper.

32:14.860 --> 32:16.293
Oh!

32:17.900 --> 32:21.051
Sweetheart, you're white.
Know what you're facing, yeah?

32:21.140 --> 32:23.335
GIRLS GASP

32:23.420 --> 32:28.210
Whoa. Oh, man, your mates are proper
cacking it. Ready to gan.

32:30.380 --> 32:33.019
SQUEALS

32:33.100 --> 32:38.697
Well, hurry home, before I tan your arse!
Sewer rat!

32:48.980 --> 32:51.494
That's all, thanks.

32:52.220 --> 32:55.974
The best night of my life.

32:57.020 --> 32:58.738
God, yeah.

33:00.340 --> 33:02.695
I mean, um, yeah, I can imagine,

33:02.780 --> 33:05.248
Kelly being a professional shag and that.

33:05.340 --> 33:08.855
No. Sex were good, but...

33:08.940 --> 33:13.809
we had, like, a... a moment, you know?

33:13.900 --> 33:16.095
I think she could be like girlfriend material.

33:16.180 --> 33:19.490
Have you heard soft lad here
taking his turn to tom?

33:19.580 --> 33:22.811
Shane, it's her job to give punters
the best night ever,

33:22.900 --> 33:24.128
so you go back for more.

33:24.220 --> 33:26.211
Yeah, I know.

33:26.300 --> 33:28.768
But this was different.

33:28.860 --> 33:30.009
Oh! Oh!

33:30.100 --> 33:33.297
Oh! Oh yeah, yeah, YEAH!

33:33.380 --> 33:37.009
Women like her fake that shit
to make you feel better.

33:37.100 --> 33:39.898
It's all pretend. Part of the game.

33:39.980 --> 33:41.936
No. Stuff you and your game.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.580
There's some things,
Jamie, that you cannot fake.

33:44.660 --> 33:47.128
Kelly's into me. You'll see.

33:54.660 --> 33:57.094
Joe 90, specky Stan...

33:57.180 --> 34:00.172
got crucified in those National Healths.

34:00.260 --> 34:04.219
No way was I putting up with that other job.
Cops are worse than kids.

34:04.300 --> 34:07.975
I were minus six, both eyes.
I had 'em lasered on honeymoon.

34:08.060 --> 34:12.531
Kash booked us on one of these
Greek cosmetic surgery cruises.

34:12.620 --> 34:14.371
So I know what it's like.

34:14.460 --> 34:16.451
Before and after.

34:16.540 --> 34:18.531
And after is miles better.

34:20.699 --> 34:23.453
Maybe that's how I should spend
my overtime fund.

34:23.540 --> 34:25.576
Just get some decent specs.

34:25.659 --> 34:28.014
We could get you a makeover! Yeah!

34:28.100 --> 34:29.579
I don't want to put you out.

34:29.659 --> 34:33.096
No, you won't be. I'll get you to baby-sit
for me some time.

34:33.179 --> 34:36.217
(Radio) 'Stan, there's a criminal
damage in progress

34:36.300 --> 34:38.609
'just round the corner.
I said we'll deal.'

34:38.699 --> 34:40.213
Received, mate. Two seconds.

34:41.340 --> 34:42.931
Put that spade down.

34:44.020 --> 34:46.580
I'm arresting you for defacing council property.

34:46.659 --> 34:49.174
What? You can't nick me for this.

34:49.260 --> 34:50.978
- Ladies.
- Tom, cuff her.

34:51.060 --> 34:52.129
Is there a problem?

34:52.219 --> 34:53.539
It's criminal damage.

34:53.620 --> 34:55.610
How is planting spuds criminal?

34:55.699 --> 34:58.658
This strip of grass was perfect
before your intervention.

34:58.740 --> 35:00.537
Now it needs repairing, right?

35:00.620 --> 35:03.578
Tom, why don't you and Debbie
see if you can sort this, eh?

35:03.660 --> 35:05.651
Carrie.

35:09.260 --> 35:11.490
- Your radio.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

35:11.580 --> 35:15.209
How else would you know about this?
Carrie, you're not on duty.

35:15.300 --> 35:19.009
Yeah, and why is that, eh? It isn't fair.
I don't deserve this.

35:19.100 --> 35:20.419
What's her problem?

35:20.500 --> 35:24.288
All I want to do is my job, that's all, that's all.
Don't you dare!

35:27.420 --> 35:29.570
Look, if you just put it back how it was,

35:29.660 --> 35:32.094
we won't take any further action, OK?

35:32.180 --> 35:34.296
Whatever! Only a day's work!

35:47.300 --> 35:49.291
Oh, you bastard!

35:49.380 --> 35:50.654
What's up?

35:50.740 --> 35:52.651
Me leg.

35:52.740 --> 35:54.173
Will you stretch it?

35:59.620 --> 36:02.339
I've been seizing up all day.

36:02.420 --> 36:05.218
You made me use muscles I never knew I had.

36:05.300 --> 36:06.494
Aren't you sore?

36:06.580 --> 36:08.457
No, I'm pretty limber, me.

36:08.540 --> 36:11.896
You need to be to get through all
the kitchen windows, don't you?

36:11.980 --> 36:14.858
So, er... maybe I should keep moving.

36:14.940 --> 36:19.013
Oh, aye? So you did like it, then?
You weren't just giving me patter?

36:19.100 --> 36:23.537
God, no! That never happens on a trick, ever.

36:23.620 --> 36:25.053
Normally switch off.

36:29.260 --> 36:31.569
If we're not doing it, though,
mind if I head back?

36:31.660 --> 36:33.298
No, no. We can go.

36:33.380 --> 36:36.258
Finish your chips. I'll take a cab out of me fee.

36:37.780 --> 36:39.577
For this, our date.

36:39.660 --> 36:42.015
This were a proper date.

36:42.100 --> 36:45.217
I was hanging out to see if...
see if there was something...

36:45.300 --> 36:48.849
Shane, this is always work.

36:48.940 --> 36:50.976
You pay for sex or company.

36:53.620 --> 36:54.848
I don't want to spoil what we have.

36:54.940 --> 36:59.172
Well, don't put me on a meter, then.

36:59.260 --> 37:02.650
I don't care what you do, Kelly. I like you.

37:04.060 --> 37:05.891
Oh...!

37:05.980 --> 37:08.574
It's Lillian. She's the problem.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.491
Takes such a chunk out of me wages.

37:10.580 --> 37:13.219
I'm virtually a slave to her.

37:13.300 --> 37:15.211
Oh, you don't need to hear this.

37:15.300 --> 37:18.098
How big a chunk?

37:18.180 --> 37:20.057
Kelly?

37:31.460 --> 37:32.688
What?

37:32.780 --> 37:35.340
Look at his arm, Debbie.

37:35.420 --> 37:36.978
Katie's covered in 'em.

37:37.060 --> 37:38.618
Your beach is builders' sand.

37:41.580 --> 37:43.810
Untreated, full of bugs.

37:43.900 --> 37:46.050
You minding other stuff, yeah?

37:46.140 --> 37:48.096
Environmental Health will shut it down, Debs.

37:48.180 --> 37:49.329
That councillor's looking for you and Chesney.

37:49.420 --> 37:50.648
He's not the only one.

37:50.740 --> 37:52.139
You need to keep your head down.

37:52.220 --> 37:52.857
She needs to do something.

37:52.940 --> 37:56.012
Carl! I'm sure you can't make
your sister feel any worse.

37:56.100 --> 37:58.694
Why is everyone having a go at me?
Stop having a go!

37:58.780 --> 38:00.691
Debbie, love.

38:00.780 --> 38:04.056
Listen, we all make mistakes.

38:04.140 --> 38:07.928
Even the best of us.
There's no need for any shame here.

38:08.020 --> 38:10.250
You're with family.

38:14.540 --> 38:16.451
He's a dead man.

38:19.900 --> 38:21.219
Shane!

38:21.300 --> 38:23.689
What are you two doing in here?

38:25.740 --> 38:27.219
Out!

38:27.300 --> 38:29.416
I want a word with me brother.

38:34.180 --> 38:36.740
I have to free Kelly.

38:36.820 --> 38:39.209
Lillian's got her trapped.

38:39.300 --> 38:41.450
She can't see past doing tricks, Mickey.

38:41.540 --> 38:45.533
If I could just... show her.

38:47.540 --> 38:49.258
Yeah, that's right, Chesney.

38:49.340 --> 38:50.898
Hide behind your veil, coward.

38:50.980 --> 38:52.652
Leave me to take the crap
from your filthy beach.

38:52.740 --> 38:55.049
Don't make a scene. Not here.

38:55.140 --> 38:56.050
Is everything OK?

38:56.140 --> 38:58.449
Fine. Misunderstanding.

38:59.500 --> 39:01.570
- Who's she?
- I'll tell you later. Just go.

39:01.660 --> 39:02.456
(Man) Debbie? >

39:02.540 --> 39:06.215
Debbie, please. You don't know what this is.
Just get out.

39:06.300 --> 39:10.179
Where's Chesney Karim?
Little bastard needs his arse kicking.

39:11.900 --> 39:14.368
Yeah, get in line.

39:18.100 --> 39:24.096
I sanctioned the beach, a clean,
safe space for families, kids.

39:24.180 --> 39:27.490
Unlicensed drinking,
two ten-year-olds in casualty,

39:27.580 --> 39:29.093
stomachs pumped,

39:29.180 --> 39:32.775
adults exposing themselves, flea-ridden sand,

39:32.860 --> 39:34.896
you running around the estate in drag.

39:34.980 --> 39:37.972
You've caused a shit storm
and spent your entire budget,

39:38.060 --> 39:41.370
it's a PR disaster.
The Mayor said you'd take the piss.

39:41.460 --> 39:44.816
I defended you,
I staked my career on this policy.

39:44.900 --> 39:47.653
I'm going to get sent back to
waste management.

39:48.740 --> 39:49.695
I'm talking to you.

39:49.780 --> 39:50.735
Don't touch me.

39:50.820 --> 39:52.333
Don't walk off then.

39:52.420 --> 39:54.411
You've pissed away public money,
how are going to account for that?

39:54.500 --> 39:56.968
I'm not, I'm just a kid, right?

39:57.060 --> 39:58.732
Wrong. You're still Young Mayor,

39:58.820 --> 40:02.699
if you can't justify your spending
we've ways of claiming it back.

40:02.780 --> 40:06.011
Let's go and see what your mum's
got to say about her rates going up.

40:07.660 --> 40:08.934
You've no idea.

40:09.020 --> 40:10.533
Who's that man?

40:10.620 --> 40:13.453
Where's he taking him?

40:13.540 --> 40:16.612
- Is he coming back?
- I doubt it.

40:16.700 --> 40:18.736
SOBBING

40:19.780 --> 40:21.054
What's wrong?

40:21.140 --> 40:22.892
Why are you upset?

40:22.980 --> 40:30.011
I know I will not see my sister
in Pakistan before she...

40:31.100 --> 40:33.056
What's all this got to do with Chesney?

40:33.140 --> 40:37.656
Chesney was about to take test for me,

40:37.740 --> 40:44.134
citizenship test to get British passport
so that when I visit her

40:44.220 --> 40:45.733
I can come back home.

40:45.820 --> 40:47.890
Chesney was going to do that for you?

40:47.980 --> 40:50.289
Bought my flight too.

40:50.380 --> 40:54.259
You what? Was that the money
he gave you at the beach?

41:02.900 --> 41:04.333
Are you going to eat that?

41:06.980 --> 41:11.610
Oh, my God! Look, it's a miracle.

41:11.700 --> 41:15.978
No, it's a scam, the cheeky mare.
Where's her wheelchair now, eh?

41:16.060 --> 41:18.130
Quick, we need photos.

41:19.180 --> 41:22.536
lf, if you do this, and show the sarge,

41:22.620 --> 41:24.770
Carrie will get reinstated, right?

41:24.860 --> 41:26.009
Yeah.

41:26.100 --> 41:28.534
Well, do we really want that?

41:28.620 --> 41:31.418
I mean, she was a bit harsh with you today

41:31.500 --> 41:33.570
and she's like Robocop on the rag

41:33.660 --> 41:35.696
when she puts on the uniform.

41:35.780 --> 41:36.974
No, I can't, I owe her.

41:37.060 --> 41:39.972
She took one for me. This way, we're quits.

41:44.460 --> 41:45.973
I have so had enough.

41:46.060 --> 41:48.779
Paralysis is nothing compared to
what I'm going to do.

41:48.860 --> 41:52.569
Let's quit while we're ahead, eh?
We don't want to lose you.

41:52.660 --> 41:54.571
We've only just got you back.

41:54.660 --> 41:57.936
What do you say? All for one?

42:23.260 --> 42:25.012
Just relax, Mr Waterman.

42:43.820 --> 42:45.492
How does that look?

42:45.580 --> 42:48.936
Oi, I'm losing the will to live here.

42:49.980 --> 42:53.495
Stunning. Absolutely stunning.

42:53.580 --> 42:55.650
< Oi!

42:55.740 --> 42:58.300
Kelly!

43:02.700 --> 43:04.930
Kelly!

43:08.100 --> 43:09.579
Ta-da!

43:09.660 --> 43:11.616
Shane, what are you doing?

43:11.700 --> 43:13.691
I've come for you. Look.

43:13.780 --> 43:16.055
(Man) At least let her finish me off. >

43:16.140 --> 43:17.858
Where are you going to take me, eh?

43:17.940 --> 43:22.968
Away from here. You don't belong to Lillian,
you don't have to do this.

43:23.060 --> 43:24.937
- You want to save me?
- Yes.

43:25.020 --> 43:29.093
Shane, this isn't Pet Rescue,
I'm not a cockroach.

43:29.180 --> 43:33.139
This is what I do, what I choose to do.

43:33.220 --> 43:37.657
I just thought, if I showed you how special
it could be with me...

43:37.740 --> 43:38.968
SIGHING

43:40.140 --> 43:41.459
It's dead sweet of you,

43:41.540 --> 43:46.375
you're a nice guy and a great lay,
but that's how it is.

43:46.460 --> 43:47.654
It doesn't mean we have to stop.

43:47.740 --> 43:53.337
I can't, I'm fuckin' brassic.
Mickey wants 50 for driving us here.

43:53.420 --> 43:55.980
How about we make this one free

43:56.060 --> 43:58.779
as long as you block-book
your next five? Sound fair?

43:58.860 --> 44:01.169
I suppose.

44:01.260 --> 44:03.569
What about...

44:03.660 --> 44:05.890
One minute, literally.

44:09.260 --> 44:10.215
Result.

44:10.300 --> 44:12.336
APPLAUSE

44:33.900 --> 44:37.449
That's sacrilege.
Have you not done enough harm today?

44:37.540 --> 44:39.292
Relax.

44:39.380 --> 44:43.851
I took the test for you.
Well, Mrs Rashida Syad.

44:44.900 --> 44:46.094
You passed!

44:46.180 --> 44:50.219
Yeah. It's harder than that
Respect One Another module, though.

44:50.300 --> 44:51.619
I don't know what to say.

44:51.700 --> 44:56.012
That's a first. I don't get it though,
what do you get out of it?

44:56.100 --> 45:00.139
Credit upstairs. Every good deed
means another hundred virgins in paradise.

45:00.220 --> 45:03.018
That's why you never bagged me,
Debbie, too many rivals.

45:03.100 --> 45:04.089
Whatever, Chesney.

45:07.380 --> 45:11.134
We're quits now, anyway. You lose, Chesney.

45:13.860 --> 45:15.896
COCK CROWS

45:15.980 --> 45:18.938
(Debbie) 'So, what came first,
chicken or the egg?

45:19.020 --> 45:21.853
'Power or corruption? Love or hate? '

45:24.020 --> 45:26.250
LAUGHTER

45:26.340 --> 45:28.376
'It does my head in.'

45:28.460 --> 45:30.098
The skits - what?

45:30.180 --> 45:31.499
Do you like it?

45:35.660 --> 45:38.857
(Debbie) 'AII I know is this, if life is an omelette

45:38.940 --> 45:42.694
'and you want to make it good...
you've got to crack a few eggs.'

45:42.780 --> 45:44.452
You not eating?

46:24.540 --> 46:26.531
Who was Hogwarts' most famous pupil?

46:26.620 --> 46:28.451
Oh, I know this!

46:28.540 --> 46:29.814
(Carrie) Stanley Potter!

46:29.900 --> 46:32.858
< Nice glasses!
