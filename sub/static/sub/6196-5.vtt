<i>Previously on Being Mary Jane...</i>

00:02.101 --> 00:05.180
Uh, I'm ready for you to
actually make that call for me.

00:05.182 --> 00:07.861
I need a job. Something steady
so I can be there for Daysha.

00:08.970 --> 00:11.815
I'd say she looks
pretty good considering.
- All I see is Scar.

00:11.891 --> 00:13.735
MARY JANE: What'd he say?
- He thought you looked good.

00:13.798 --> 00:16.224
Any sign of Kara?
- MAN: She said she's
five seconds away.

00:16.226 --> 00:17.297
MARY JANE: Kara, what the hell?

00:17.299 --> 00:19.211
I told you I had that thing
at school this morning.

00:19.213 --> 00:21.470
It can't always be about you, mama.
I'm sorry.

00:21.472 --> 00:23.514
Greg sidelined me for another
week.

00:23.516 --> 00:24.765
I need to get back to work.

00:24.767 --> 00:27.226
Just give me some time with Greg,
and let me see what I can get done.

00:27.281 --> 00:28.383
Sit tight.

00:28.968 --> 00:30.793
MARY JANE: What?
- GREG: We are not pulling
her off the air!

00:30.795 --> 00:32.496
MARY JANE: Oh, my God,
I am so tired of this.

00:32.497 --> 00:34.607
I am ready to come back.
I want my seat back, Greg.

00:34.609 --> 00:36.527
You'll get your seat back,
just not now.

00:36.529 --> 00:38.519
Marisol is the right face for
immigration.

00:38.521 --> 00:41.435
Oh, please, I can talk circles around
her on all of those issues.

00:41.692 --> 00:42.917
And I can do it in Español.

00:43.099 --> 00:45.554
GREG: You may know Spanish,
but she is Spanish.

00:46.374 --> 00:49.724
I like the wordplay there, Greg,
but she's actually Mexican.

00:49.726 --> 00:52.148
GREG: Whatever she is, she's
in that chair.

00:52.210 --> 00:54.327
I've never known her to go
this long.

00:54.714 --> 00:56.870
Ten bucks says she gets her way.

00:57.934 --> 00:59.267
I'll take that bet.

00:59.269 --> 01:02.237
We'll know she lost if she walks by
without making eye contact.

01:02.239 --> 01:03.489
But if she does,

01:03.848 --> 01:06.489
there's gonna be some major
changes in Primetime.

01:06.910 --> 01:07.961
You're on.

01:08.341 --> 01:09.649
MARY JANE: Greg, you' wrong.

01:10.580 --> 01:11.891
You're wrong.

01:12.282 --> 01:13.529
It's my show.

01:13.750 --> 01:15.257
It's my audience.
- No,

01:15.477 --> 01:16.718
it's SNC's show.

01:17.010 --> 01:18.476
And it's SNC's audience.

01:21.841 --> 01:22.841

MAN: There is simply no legitimate
reason to keep Ms. Paul off the air.

02:42.339 --> 02:45.448
And the longer this plays out,
we have to start asking ourselves why.

02:47.461 --> 02:49.010
This isn't a race issue.

02:49.012 --> 02:50.545
We'd like to believe you.

02:50.547 --> 02:52.881
Which is why we're here
to hear you out.

02:52.883 --> 02:56.088
SNC is one of a very few news
outlets to make a concerted effort

02:56.090 --> 02:57.825
in presenting different points of view.

02:57.827 --> 03:01.856
Yes, but your first black Primetime
anchor remains off the air,
and that's a problem.

03:03.836 --> 03:05.036
[sighs]

03:07.607 --> 03:10.991
Isn't your organization for the
advancement of all people?

03:10.993 --> 03:13.546
I mean, wasn't Georgia
one of the few states

03:14.382 --> 03:17.473
to have its first Hispanic Push
chapter president?

03:17.491 --> 03:20.024
Your understanding of
our organization is correct.

03:20.026 --> 03:21.543
But what we also have to monitor

03:21.545 --> 03:24.195
is that corporations aren't
throwing so few crumbs

03:24.197 --> 03:26.672
that people of color are not
only be discriminated against

03:26.674 --> 03:29.572
but made to fight instead of align
over issues of employment.

03:29.574 --> 03:32.394
Well, you know, those issues
are coming up in this next election.

03:32.464 --> 03:35.206
SNC would love to hear your
unique perspective,

03:35.208 --> 03:38.006
provide a counter for the same old
election rhetoric.

03:38.895 --> 03:39.928
Look,

03:40.108 --> 03:43.565
we would love more television time
when the opportunity presents itself.

03:43.567 --> 03:45.525
But as it stands right now,
our only focus

03:45.527 --> 03:46.981
is getting Ms. Paul back on air.

03:47.187 --> 03:48.802
We don't have an exact date yet.

03:48.809 --> 03:50.021
MAN: That's not good enough.

03:50.023 --> 03:51.403
We need to lock in a timeframe,

03:51.405 --> 03:53.942
or we'll be forced to
take this issue public.

03:53.944 --> 03:56.146
Okay, that won't be necessary.

03:57.030 --> 03:58.079

04:15.952 --> 04:17.529
MARY JANE: Look, I thought
we were in agreement

04:17.531 --> 04:19.646
that I needed to be back
on air as soon as possible.

Okay, well it didn't really feel
like you were pushing for me.

04:22.242 --> 04:24.294
And I gave you $5,000
to the cause.

04:24.975 --> 04:26.904
Ms. Paul, this matter
was assigned to me

04:26.906 --> 04:29.074
based on the merits of the cause,
not your contribution.

04:29.076 --> 04:30.761
Well, you still could have
pressed harder.

04:30.763 --> 04:32.814
And we will, but this takes time.

04:32.816 --> 04:35.220
There is a sequential process
which includes research,

04:35.222 --> 04:36.603
education, negotiation,

04:36.605 --> 04:38.786
confrontation, and reconciliation.

04:38.788 --> 04:40.622
If that doesn't move
the needle further, then we're up...

04:40.624 --> 04:42.490
Okay, then what do we do?

04:42.492 --> 04:44.826
We all just join hands and
sing We Shall Overcome

04:44.828 --> 04:47.111
and hope they give us a seat
on the front of the bus?

04:47.113 --> 04:48.613

04:48.615 --> 04:50.732
This is a process, Ms. Paul.

You just have to be patient.

10:05.221 --> 10:07.438
I don't care how mad you get,
you need to hear the truth.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.107
And the truth is you're rude
and ungrateful.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.392
And you better check yourself.

10:13.896 --> 10:15.161
[phone ringing]

10:15.162 --> 10:17.815
JACKIE: Hey, baby.
- NIECY: Oh my God, Mom, please tell me you're here.

10:17.817 --> 10:19.450
JACKIE: No, baby, I missed my
damn flight.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.569
But I'm on the next one though.

10:21.664 --> 10:22.696
I'm coming.

10:22.753 --> 10:25.004
I promised you, I'm coming.

10:28.644 --> 10:30.653
Patrick, you're late.

10:30.847 --> 10:32.253
[groans]

10:32.479 --> 10:35.604
Now, look, you have
got to stay on schedule,

10:35.736 --> 10:37.301
log inventory properly.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.170
You're already an hour

10:39.178 --> 10:40.971
behind today, which means...
- No, I'm getting better.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.830
I don't need better.

10:42.832 --> 10:44.475
I need excellent.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.310
Now I don't care
who your father is.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.145
If you wanna work at KO Cola,

10:48.147 --> 10:49.898
you have to perform.

10:50.869 --> 10:51.892
Yeah.

10:52.053 --> 10:53.336
MAN: Okay.

10:57.574 --> 11:02.043
And then she put her hand
on her hips, rolled her eyes,
and stomped out the room.

11:02.045 --> 11:03.404
MARY JANE: No, she didn't.

11:04.203 --> 11:05.329
Hand to God.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.714
Niecy better stop all that.

11:06.716 --> 11:08.466
And then she had the nerve

11:08.468 --> 11:10.794
to ask for a ride to work.

11:11.068 --> 11:13.976
NIECY: Well, the key takeaway
is that she's working.

11:13.978 --> 11:17.624
But enough on her. Niecy says that
she saw you on the gossip shows,

11:17.626 --> 11:19.001
says you're going back to work.

11:20.063 --> 11:22.897
It wasn't an interview, Mom.
It was just the paparazzi hounding me.

11:23.011 --> 11:25.128
MOM: But you're gonna be
back on air, right?

11:26.230 --> 11:27.230
Yep.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.966
MOM: Oh, well, now that's good.

11:30.206 --> 11:33.241
Now, you sound ungrateful.

11:33.243 --> 11:34.408
[phone beeping]

11:34.410 --> 11:37.044
Oh, Mom, look, I gotta let
you go, it's work.

11:37.046 --> 11:38.212
I guess I'll talk to you...

11:38.214 --> 11:39.664
[dial tone sounds]

11:41.093 --> 11:42.185
Any updates?

11:42.187 --> 11:44.906
KARA: Hey, MJ, uh, Greg's
looking for you.

11:45.255 --> 11:48.205
I don't wanna talk to his fat ass.

11:48.207 --> 11:51.478
Uh, MJ, you're on speakerphone with me

11:51.480 --> 11:53.711
and Greg right now, baby doll.

11:53.713 --> 11:58.015
And my fat ass wants
you in my office now.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.892
[dial tone sounds]

12:11.209 --> 12:13.335
I am ready for "Primetime." And I'm...

12:13.610 --> 12:15.467
happy to announce you won't
have to wait much longer.

12:15.469 --> 12:17.067
I'll be back on the air on Monday.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.253
So you had to go
and make a statement?

12:19.255 --> 12:21.706
How many times has SNC
delayed my return?

12:21.708 --> 12:22.740
I had no choice.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.296
You walk around here with a
chip on your shoulder,

12:25.421 --> 12:27.762
unable to see that
I am your biggest ally.

12:27.764 --> 12:28.997
Me.

12:29.382 --> 12:32.379
And despite your general
ungrateful disposition,

12:32.591 --> 12:35.934
I am the one constantly
advocating for you.

12:36.472 --> 12:37.888
So I get it.

12:37.890 --> 12:39.590
All right, I'm not good at race.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.758
I'm white.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.560
I'm not going to be good at race.

12:42.562 --> 12:45.646
But I am not a racist.

12:45.648 --> 12:47.902
And every decision I make around
here, Mary Jane,

12:48.215 --> 12:49.784
is not about you being black.

12:49.903 --> 12:53.278
Now I allowed your complaints
of race and discrimination muzzle me.

12:53.573 --> 12:55.573
But it didn't stop me from
taking notes.

12:58.989 --> 13:00.279
Mary Jane Paul,

13:00.934 --> 13:03.270
Monday, late. Tuesday, late.

13:03.387 --> 13:05.800
Wednesday, didn't do
what we ask her.

13:05.802 --> 13:07.057
Thursday, sassy.

13:07.059 --> 13:09.337
Friday, sassy and late.

13:09.339 --> 13:11.471
Oh, and on any given
Monday through Friday,

13:11.526 --> 13:13.302
never comes in early to prepare.

13:13.343 --> 13:15.676
Always strolls in right before air.

13:15.678 --> 13:17.595
I'm always prepared.
- No.

13:17.597 --> 13:20.097
What you are is a pain in my ass.

13:26.545 --> 13:28.045
[sighs]

13:31.361 --> 13:32.447
You're back on Monday.

13:33.674 --> 13:35.090
And you better be ready.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.065
And if you'd excuse me,

13:38.534 --> 13:40.501
my fat ass wants you out of my office.

13:50.787 --> 13:52.954
LARRY: Hey, what's up, MJ?
- MARY JANE: Hey, Larry,

13:53.005 --> 13:54.799
I need you to come over
and work your magic.

13:54.801 --> 13:57.685
I'm back on air on Monday,
and I need something fly.

13:57.687 --> 13:58.811
LARRY: Okay.

13:58.813 --> 14:00.359
I was thinking about like a...

14:00.945 --> 14:03.187
I don't know, I think maybe
it's time to go shorter.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.030
Anything to help the ratings.

14:05.038 --> 14:07.499
[doorbell rings]

14:08.420 --> 14:10.284
Mom!

14:10.286 --> 14:11.419
[yelling]

14:11.421 --> 14:14.806
[laughing]

14:14.871 --> 14:17.822
Oh my God, I miss you, too.

14:17.824 --> 14:19.990
Wow, you got them to sleep fast.

14:19.992 --> 14:22.794
Yeah, well, you know, I got
it down now.

14:23.496 --> 14:24.964
You're really good with them.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.915
Thank you.
- Oh, close your eyes.

14:27.917 --> 14:29.884
Close my eyes?
- Yes.

14:33.744 --> 14:35.236
Ta-da!

14:35.837 --> 14:37.892
Oh my gosh, are you kidding me?

14:37.894 --> 14:40.628
[laughs] I couldn't decide,
so I got 'em both.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.713
Oh, so you just got 'em both.

14:42.715 --> 14:43.806
Okay.

14:43.808 --> 14:46.550
These are beautiful.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.268
Thank you.

14:48.346 --> 14:50.404
Thank you so much, Mom.

14:50.406 --> 14:51.735
You're welcome.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.860
I wish you were here more, Ma.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.895
Child, why? So I can buy you
some more stuff?

14:57.897 --> 14:59.225
[laughing]

14:59.759 --> 15:00.928
No.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.189
I just want the kids to,
you know, really know you.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.968
My work schedule's
so crazy right now. I...

15:07.445 --> 15:09.195
but I tell you, I'm just a
phone call away.

15:09.459 --> 15:11.171
And you can always Skype me.

15:11.577 --> 15:14.800
Well, when I call you, you know,
I can't really reach you.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.748
Well you never leave a message.
- And you never call back.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.016
That's not true, I...

15:21.006 --> 15:22.240
You know what?

15:23.069 --> 15:25.092
I'll just work on it.
- Okay.

15:25.094 --> 15:27.641
You know that little one's still up.

15:27.643 --> 15:29.416
Oh, well, I'll go. Let me...

15:29.418 --> 15:32.978
Oh, no, no, no, I didn't say it for you
to go up there and start spoiling her.

15:32.980 --> 15:35.112
I just wanted to give
you a general alert.

15:35.114 --> 15:37.081
Here, Niecy.
- Oh, thank you.

15:40.789 --> 15:42.843
You're... you're looking good,
Mrs. Patterson.

15:43.802 --> 15:45.747
Niecy was just catching me on

15:45.749 --> 15:48.288
what everybody's doing
and her new job.

15:48.290 --> 15:49.780
Yeah.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.999
And she tells me that you do
hair for a stripper.

15:53.414 --> 15:54.780
Nicki Minaj, Grandma.

15:54.837 --> 15:56.670
She does hair for Nicki Minaj.

15:56.672 --> 15:58.005
Who?
- NIECY: Nicki Minaj.

15:58.007 --> 16:01.675
The multimillionaire rapper, singer.

16:01.677 --> 16:05.513
Oh, well, whatever pays the bills.

16:05.515 --> 16:07.703
We all have bills, you know?

16:08.434 --> 16:11.363
Now, Niecy, I hope you're
not gonna leave this mess.

16:11.379 --> 16:13.629
I don't wanna come in here
having to pick up after you.

16:14.155 --> 16:16.043
I run a clean house.

16:16.778 --> 16:18.700
Good to see you again, Jackie.

16:19.220 --> 16:20.814
Uh, thanks.

16:24.935 --> 16:26.940
[laughs] What?

16:27.146 --> 16:29.833
Unreal.
- When did she get so nice?

16:29.864 --> 16:31.463
Nice? Really?
- Yes. I mean...

16:31.465 --> 16:33.490
She... she spoke to me.

16:33.492 --> 16:34.658
That's progress.

16:34.660 --> 16:37.494
I can't believe she tried
to pretend like she doesn't
know who Nicki Minaj is.

16:37.496 --> 16:40.133
Everybody knows who she is
and that you do her hair.

16:40.687 --> 16:43.333
Well, you can do hair, too,
you know?

16:43.335 --> 16:45.335
Yeah, but you know, hair was
always like a side hustle.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.487
I don't have a portfolio
or anything like that.

16:48.206 --> 16:50.007
I've been asking you to get one.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.764
Mm-hmm, but can't you
just hook me up?

16:52.766 --> 16:54.601
You know my skills?
- Yeah, but the people

16:54.603 --> 16:57.353
that I have to sell you to,
they don't know that.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.800
You have to help me
help you, honey.

17:00.653 --> 17:03.370
Yeah, well, I already
have a job now, so...

17:03.372 --> 17:04.954
Yeah, but I'm not talking
about a job.

17:04.957 --> 17:06.857
I am talking about a viable,

17:06.858 --> 17:10.044
lucrative career, okay?

17:10.046 --> 17:11.528
Where you can be your own boss.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.864
You can... and travel the world.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.531
You can have an income

17:15.534 --> 17:18.635
that supports you
and those beautiful babies.

17:18.838 --> 17:19.843
Before you know it, honey,

17:19.845 --> 17:21.907
you'll be buying
new purses and jewels.

17:21.910 --> 17:23.540
[laughs]

17:23.541 --> 17:24.744
I won a Ferrari.

17:24.747 --> 17:26.448
What?
- Yeah. [laughs]

17:26.450 --> 17:29.121
Who from?
- In my dreams, honey.

17:29.123 --> 17:30.856
I love you, Mom.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.610
Stop staring so much.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.887
Are we at a sex club?
- No.

18:35.889 --> 18:38.621
Folks are just taking advantage
of the no cameras,

18:38.623 --> 18:40.634
no paparazzi rule.

18:40.636 --> 18:43.453
But I'm so glad you could
make it out.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.973
Yeah, I had to get out before
the big moment.

18:45.975 --> 18:47.091
I'm back on air.

18:47.093 --> 18:48.749
That's right, congrats, mama.

18:48.751 --> 18:49.755
Yes.

18:49.757 --> 18:51.882
What if my ratings aren't as
good as Marisol's?

18:51.884 --> 18:53.656
Stop all that.
Just stop it, stop it.

18:53.658 --> 18:55.439
You always create these little
mountains in your life.

18:55.441 --> 18:58.745
You know you're gonna overcome them.
You are going to kill it.

18:58.747 --> 19:00.825
Kill it. Hey.

19:04.716 --> 19:06.364
Now who has a staring problem?

19:06.411 --> 19:09.049
You know what? It looks like he hasn't
worked out in a while though.

19:09.051 --> 19:11.532
What are you talking about?
He looks like he's in great shape.

19:11.534 --> 19:13.000
He's not in gay shape.

19:13.002 --> 19:16.611
Okay, so you're telling me that
if he wanted to have sex with you,
you would say no?

19:16.613 --> 19:17.886
I, uh...

19:18.575 --> 19:20.058
I don't know, I'm off from dating.

19:20.426 --> 19:22.911
A little so...
- Oh, God, please, no.

19:22.913 --> 19:24.678
Do you know that football player
I told you about?

19:24.680 --> 19:26.013
Yeah.

19:26.015 --> 19:28.298
He's really been there for me lately.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.500
And no.
- I didn't even get the rest out.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.173
You don't have to,
I already hear it in your voice.

19:32.175 --> 19:34.903
You're trying to make him your man.
- He is nice to me.

19:34.982 --> 19:37.099
And maybe I should stop looking for...

19:37.208 --> 19:38.676
the right one and consider

19:38.889 --> 19:40.419
a nice one.

19:40.421 --> 19:42.073
You know you had it right
the first time.

19:42.075 --> 19:44.393
Okay, let him be a little
scratch for the itch.

19:44.395 --> 19:45.566
But, see, don't confuse that...

19:45.568 --> 19:48.177
Well, I'm... I'm discovering.

19:48.179 --> 19:50.460
Well, maybe you're settling.

19:50.462 --> 19:52.022
Look, okay, let's be honest.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.391
We both know

19:53.393 --> 19:55.471
that if you were trying
to make him your man,

19:55.473 --> 19:57.769
you would already screw
that relationship up.
- Shut up.

19:57.771 --> 19:59.230
You know you would have.

20:01.922 --> 20:03.403
Look, Mary Jane...

20:05.407 --> 20:08.042
You like him for the sex, okay?

20:08.117 --> 20:11.563
So just spend the rest
of the time on you.

20:12.211 --> 20:15.289
Read, travel, but please

20:15.291 --> 20:17.598
let the one find you.

20:17.816 --> 20:19.566
He's gonna come.

20:19.568 --> 20:21.852

20:27.665 --> 20:29.662

action, aren't I?

20:32.926 --> 20:35.114
Well, I mean...
- I'm sorry.

20:35.192 --> 20:38.127
I've kinda been a hoe lately,

20:38.129 --> 20:39.473
so I could slow down.

20:39.887 --> 20:41.777

20:43.340 --> 20:44.884
Yeah, I guess so.

MARY JANE: Does anal hurt?

20:48.605 --> 20:50.784
I don't know. I'm a top.

20:51.229 --> 20:53.730
You've never bottomed?
- No.

20:53.740 --> 20:55.276
Really?
- Really.

20:55.408 --> 20:59.312
Mary Jane, look, we, you know...
we aren't all receivers.

20:59.314 --> 21:02.092
I mean, okay, do you do anal?

21:02.094 --> 21:04.094
No.
- Okay, hello.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.280
I don't do it for the same
reasons you don't.

21:06.282 --> 21:07.764
How 'bout that?

21:07.766 --> 21:09.149
Nice.

21:09.151 --> 21:11.768
To giving. Oh.

21:11.770 --> 21:12.953
And receiving.

21:12.955 --> 21:14.579
Cheers.
- Cheers.

21:18.931 --> 21:20.456
Oh, whoa.

21:21.221 --> 21:23.517
Let me ask you a question.
- Uh-oh.

21:24.667 --> 21:25.909
Can you...

21:26.761 --> 21:29.518
see a guy that you desire and then

21:29.979 --> 21:32.139
have sex with him that same day?

21:32.141 --> 21:33.237
Um...

21:34.331 --> 21:37.088
usually I'm more of a
three date minimum

21:37.090 --> 21:38.428
before the goodies kind of gal.

21:38.430 --> 21:40.316
Okay, why?

21:40.667 --> 21:43.984
Because it's...
- Oh my God, Mary Jane, you kill me.

21:43.986 --> 21:46.601
Come on, you're always pretending
to be this oh miss goody-goody

21:46.603 --> 21:49.139
and you're patiently
waiting for Mr. Right.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.273
Come on, girl, you just
know you want a man

21:51.275 --> 21:53.422
to blow your back out.

21:53.424 --> 21:55.181
Boh! And dinner.

21:55.183 --> 21:56.087
Yes.

21:56.089 --> 21:59.333
I also want love, but not
necessarily in that order.

21:59.335 --> 22:01.869
Well, I'll tell you what.
Since you're full of it,

22:01.871 --> 22:05.575
I see someone I want to go
be a naughty boy with.

22:05.905 --> 22:07.294
Oh.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.888
So that's how you do it, huh?

22:10.202 --> 22:12.619
You just walk up and say,

22:12.715 --> 22:14.584
Please blow my back out?

22:15.334 --> 22:17.334
MARK: Basically, yeah.

22:17.336 --> 22:20.298
We don't confuse sex
with relationships.

22:22.181 --> 22:23.882
There are several hot-button issues

22:23.884 --> 22:26.139
swaying the conversation
in this upcoming election

22:26.141 --> 22:29.146
from immigration to
minimum wage to abortion.

22:29.148 --> 22:32.367
But tonight, we'll take an in-depth
look at voter suppression.

22:35.142 --> 22:36.204
KARA: Keep talking, MJ,

22:36.206 --> 22:38.423
the teleprompter broke,
but we're working on it. Okay?

22:38.501 --> 22:40.569
As we march closer to the election,

22:40.571 --> 22:43.744
voter ID laws remain
a constant issue of contention.

22:43.814 --> 22:46.071
The Voting Rights Act of 1965

22:46.126 --> 22:48.654
was a critical piece of
legislation in this country

22:48.656 --> 22:50.033
that was highly effective

22:50.035 --> 22:52.886
in eliminating discriminatory
practices in elections.

22:52.888 --> 22:54.511
In June of 2013,

22:54.513 --> 22:56.677
the Supreme Court ruled
that section four

22:56.679 --> 22:59.726
of the civil rights law
was unconstitutional.

22:59.728 --> 23:01.772
Section four required certain areas to

23:01.774 --> 23:04.398
clear their voting laws
with the federal government.

23:04.513 --> 23:06.479
See, now that this provision is gone,

23:06.481 --> 23:09.106
several states like
Wisconsin, Texas, Virginia,

23:09.108 --> 23:12.739
and Georgia have begun
to pass strict photo ID laws,

23:12.741 --> 23:14.775
which have a direct effect on voters,

23:14.777 --> 23:16.109
making it much more difficult

23:16.111 --> 23:17.813
for people of color, the youth,

23:17.815 --> 23:20.447
the disabled, and the elderly to vote.

23:20.611 --> 23:23.233
Without restoring this portion
of the Voting Rights Act,

23:23.235 --> 23:25.285
can we really say that every American

23:25.403 --> 23:28.872
has fair and equal access to vote?
- KARA: All right.

23:28.874 --> 23:30.413
You can throw to commercial.

23:30.498 --> 23:31.925
After the break,

23:31.927 --> 23:33.410
we'll address this question

23:33.412 --> 23:36.021
and examine both sides
of the argument.

23:36.974 --> 23:38.200
MAN: And we're out.

23:43.404 --> 23:45.891
JACKIE: It was so good
to spend time with you.

23:45.892 --> 23:47.298
Well, thank you for dinner.

23:47.300 --> 23:50.494
Oh, baby, you are so welcome.

23:50.496 --> 23:53.160
When that boy... Wasn't he cute?

23:53.162 --> 23:56.443
[laughs] When he spilled the
soup all over his...

23:56.451 --> 23:58.923
oh, hey, Patrick.

23:58.963 --> 24:00.954
Good to see you, Jackie.

24:00.956 --> 24:01.972
Been awhile.

24:01.974 --> 24:04.307
Yeah.

24:04.309 --> 24:05.525
What happened to you?

24:05.527 --> 24:06.902
I thought you were coming back by 9.

24:06.941 --> 24:09.096
NIECY: Well, I mean, it wasn't
like I was out partying.

24:09.098 --> 24:10.430
I was having dinner with mom.

24:10.432 --> 24:12.015
PATRICK: And I want you to spend
time with your mom,

24:12.017 --> 24:14.101
but your grandparents can't stay up
this late with the kids.

24:14.103 --> 24:15.519
And I got an early morning.

24:15.521 --> 24:18.438
I tried calling you.

24:18.440 --> 24:19.844
Okay, and I tried calling you back.

24:19.846 --> 24:22.369
But I had no bars, so like...

24:22.931 --> 24:25.529
Niecy, why didn't you tell
you needed to be home by 9?

24:25.531 --> 24:28.852
I mean, we coulda taken
the kids with us.

24:29.968 --> 24:32.798
Don't trip.
It's... it's not that late, guys.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.371
JACKIE: I think you're
missing the point here.

24:34.373 --> 24:36.039
You should never be late.

24:36.041 --> 24:38.452
Especially when someone's
trying to help you.

24:38.454 --> 24:39.459
[sighs]

24:39.461 --> 24:42.996
Young lady,
you're not a child anymore.

24:42.998 --> 24:45.182
And this isn't cute.

24:45.184 --> 24:46.609
You understand?

24:47.070 --> 24:50.303
[laughs] I'm gonna go to bed.

24:54.790 --> 24:56.769
Oh, so you want me to do hair now?

24:56.771 --> 24:58.399
NIECY: Nope, not anymore.
Thank you.

24:58.401 --> 24:59.446
All right.

25:01.650 --> 25:02.950
Wow.

25:03.485 --> 25:04.534
I'll go talk to her.

25:04.536 --> 25:08.155
No, no, no, just... just...
just let her feel it.

25:12.543 --> 25:13.764
How you been?

25:14.046 --> 25:15.875
You know, I've been good.

25:16.843 --> 25:20.038
Yeah, you know, we don't really
talk much anymore.

25:20.368 --> 25:21.476
But, uh,

25:22.141 --> 25:24.318
I'll be in town for another day.

25:24.339 --> 25:26.811
Maybe we can grab
some dinner and catch up.

25:28.177 --> 25:29.748
Dinner sounds good.

25:30.037 --> 25:31.213
Good.
- PATRICK: Yeah.

25:31.215 --> 25:32.348
Good.

25:33.840 --> 25:35.582
That one's something else, you know?

25:35.584 --> 25:38.019
PATRICK: Yeah. I don't know
where she gets it from.

25:38.604 --> 25:39.713
Tell me again.

25:41.106 --> 25:43.598
Flawless, darling.
- Yes, yes, I was, wasn't I?

25:43.600 --> 25:44.637
Yes, you were.

25:44.639 --> 25:46.502
I didn't trip, I didn't stumble.

25:46.504 --> 25:47.629
No.
- You can't teach that.

25:47.631 --> 25:49.229
No, you cannot.
- Hmm-mm.

25:49.231 --> 25:50.709
You are very cool under pressure.

25:50.711 --> 25:52.699
You couldn't see the scar?
- KARA: No, I couldn't see it.

25:52.701 --> 25:54.367
It looks amazing.
- Okay, okay.

25:54.369 --> 25:56.586
You think Greg set me up with
the whole teleprompter thing?

25:56.588 --> 25:58.255
Seriously?

25:58.257 --> 25:59.572
Well, if he did, he failed.

25:59.574 --> 26:01.625
Okay.
- Okay.

26:01.744 --> 26:04.274
But you know those things happen.
You know it wasn't Greg.

26:04.666 --> 26:06.249
Oh goodness.

26:06.298 --> 26:08.131
Well, since we worked hard,
are you ready to play?

26:08.133 --> 26:10.550
Wanna go get some drinks?
- I wish, I wish, I wish.

26:11.154 --> 26:13.338
But you know now that I've moved
back in with John and the kids,

26:13.340 --> 26:16.020
I have some stuff to do.
I gotta unpack.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.128
Wanna come over?
- Absolutely not.

Of course not.
I knew you were gonna say that.

30:20.339 --> 30:23.228
[laughs] I still think about
Sheila E, mm.

30:23.705 --> 30:26.673

- Yeah, right, right, right.

30:26.675 --> 30:29.676
I almost got smacked that night,
too.

30:29.678 --> 30:31.845

30:39.701 --> 30:42.300
Yeah, we did that. Yes, we did.

30:42.302 --> 30:43.302
Mm-hmm.

30:43.400 --> 30:44.349

30:44.351 --> 30:47.001
Already got a promotion her
first month at the pharmacy.

30:47.362 --> 30:49.145
That's our girl.
- Yep.

30:49.147 --> 30:51.790
When she puts her
mind to something...

30:53.112 --> 30:54.602
Look, I wanted to say
something to you,

30:54.604 --> 30:56.299
and I don't want you to take it wrong.

30:57.188 --> 30:58.608
Okay.

30:59.541 --> 31:00.929

31:01.897 --> 31:04.160
but you gotta stop letting
Niecy walk over you, okay?

31:04.162 --> 31:06.216
She doesn't. You just caught her
at a bad moment.

31:06.231 --> 31:08.427
See, there you go making
excuses for her.

31:09.167 --> 31:10.386
You and I,

31:10.745 --> 31:12.548
we made grownup decisions

31:12.698 --> 31:14.521
because we did grownup things.

31:15.255 --> 31:17.896
But you keep babying her.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.009
You're gonna stunt her growth.

31:21.596 --> 31:22.900
Mm.

31:23.181 --> 31:25.932
Well, since we're being honest here.

31:25.934 --> 31:27.347
Okay.

31:27.769 --> 31:29.442
You need to come around more.

31:29.444 --> 31:30.606
A lot more.

31:32.908 --> 31:34.126
I work.

31:34.474 --> 31:36.274
Yeah, so?

31:39.105 --> 31:41.267
Well, the reality is, she's...

31:41.652 --> 31:43.421
she's mad at both of us.

31:44.674 --> 31:46.377
And she takes it out on you.

31:46.700 --> 31:47.737
Sorry.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.018
Well, she's right though.

31:49.758 --> 31:52.074
I don't know about that,
but I do know that if

31:52.076 --> 31:53.456
she doesn't get out of this pity party,

31:53.458 --> 31:56.045
she's gonna end up
pregnant again or strung out.

32:02.303 --> 32:03.759
You know, um...

32:06.195 --> 32:08.023
When things got tough...

32:10.309 --> 32:12.639

32:16.961 --> 32:18.146
Yeah.

32:18.629 --> 32:20.620

32:28.797 --> 32:30.747
Yeah, I'm on the tour.

32:32.133 --> 32:34.012

32:35.754 --> 32:37.509

32:38.757 --> 32:41.975
Well, you do Nicki Minaj's
dancers' hair.

32:41.977 --> 32:43.687

All the amazing destinations.

33:01.390 --> 33:02.991
But, honestly, Pat,

33:03.772 --> 33:05.734
I spend most of my time

33:06.761 --> 33:10.799
on airplanes and
uncomfortable chairs in airports.

I'm always on call and...

33:15.357 --> 33:16.871

I don't even know the last time
I slept in my own bed.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.468
And I think I messed the girls up.

33:29.486 --> 33:30.819
Did I mess 'em up?

33:40.375 --> 33:42.132
Brothers are always thinking.
