00:00.895 --> 00:03.152
Previously on Spotless...

00:03.904 --> 00:05.963
I know where your wife works.

00:06.366 --> 00:08.850
I know where your kids go to school.

00:09.077 --> 00:10.794
I am gonna make them bleed.

00:11.528 --> 00:12.815
Who's Casey?

00:12.935 --> 00:14.703
It's her avatar. On her laptop.

00:14.736 --> 00:16.889
For fuck's sake, can't I have any privacy?

00:16.906 --> 00:18.728
Hey, language please!

00:19.081 --> 00:22.333
This could kill you. Where is it?

00:22.355 --> 00:24.100
I flushed it down the toilet.

00:25.745 --> 00:27.147
I can sell it for you.

00:27.208 --> 00:28.379
Good money.

00:28.848 --> 00:30.637
I just wanted to say goodbye.

00:30.808 --> 00:33.187
He was mad messing around with that girl,

00:33.209 --> 00:35.401
when he had you. Why risk it?

00:35.428 --> 00:37.383
For the sake of a distraction?

00:37.724 --> 00:40.562
It's time to get Jean out of your life.

00:43.726 --> 00:45.735
Oh my God. I'm so sorry.

00:45.796 --> 00:47.668
And these things happen.

00:48.496 --> 00:50.727
You and I have nothing
to do with your husband.

00:50.760 --> 00:53.510
You don't understand the
kind of damage this could do.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.154
You were late last night.

00:55.331 --> 00:56.717
Recognize this?

00:58.308 --> 01:00.130
Victor knows.

02:36.885 --> 02:39.169
- Whose party is this?
- It's my mate, Nutmeg's.

02:39.408 --> 02:41.435
Most are college kids, I think.

02:43.975 --> 02:45.788
Here. Look what I got.

02:47.135 --> 02:48.644
300 quid.

02:48.764 --> 02:50.294
For the gear you gave me.

02:52.825 --> 02:54.703
I took a couple but it's still a good deal.

02:57.077 --> 02:58.448
Can you get more?

02:59.229 --> 03:00.964
I don't even know you.

03:01.805 --> 03:04.625
- Then what are you doin' here?
- You invited me here.

03:06.677 --> 03:07.970
It's a party.

03:09.104 --> 03:10.314
I'm your mate.

03:12.163 --> 03:13.474
And now you're here...

03:14.691 --> 03:16.229
let's have some fun.

03:41.446 --> 03:43.491
Let's get you somewhere quieter.

03:47.908 --> 03:49.948
Here... it's Nutmeg's bed.

03:50.068 --> 03:51.356
He'll be cool.

03:54.987 --> 03:57.074
Can I be any more embarrassing?

03:59.691 --> 04:01.522
It was hot up there.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.366
Thanks for looking after me.

04:04.586 --> 04:07.759
- I'm really glad we met.
- Sleep if you want.

04:08.480 --> 04:09.971
I'll take care of you.

04:26.112 --> 04:27.072
You OK?

04:28.818 --> 04:29.671
Yeah.

04:30.750 --> 04:32.044
Yeah, it's just...

04:32.569 --> 04:34.800
Maddy didn't come until
twelve o'clock last night.

04:34.920 --> 04:36.134
On a school night?

04:36.844 --> 04:39.425
Well, on any night,
Jean. She's 13 years old.

04:39.759 --> 04:41.006
I'll have a word with her.

04:41.728 --> 04:44.912
- So you're gonna be bad cop for once?
- Well, it doesn't have to be a battle.

04:45.741 --> 04:47.679
I'll treat her like an adult.

04:59.468 --> 05:00.679
Do you want a cup?

05:12.951 --> 05:14.328
Hey sweetie.

05:15.407 --> 05:16.737
Had fun last night?

05:20.344 --> 05:22.264
Twelve o'clock is too late.

05:22.670 --> 05:24.393
Yeah, sorry.

05:24.513 --> 05:25.634
Much too late.

05:25.646 --> 05:27.983
I went to a film with
Orla. It was really long.

05:28.925 --> 05:31.770
Well next time, phone. Your
mom and I were pretty worried.

05:31.890 --> 05:34.029
I'm so sorry, you must
have been freaking out.

05:34.053 --> 05:35.210
I won't do it again.

05:46.330 --> 05:47.678
It's not plugged in.

05:48.095 --> 05:49.300
I'm faking it.

05:50.856 --> 05:55.572
"Last night you were drunk. You naked - pic 1"

05:55.948 --> 05:59.484
"You naked - pic 2"

06:02.316 --> 06:04.087
- What happened?
- I don't know.

06:04.207 --> 06:06.019
You're the parenting guru.

06:08.022 --> 06:10.264
- You're busy today?
- Mm-hmm.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.053
Can I buy you lunch?

06:12.291 --> 06:13.640
Well, I have a deadline.

06:14.074 --> 06:16.250
I can bring something to the workshop.

06:16.679 --> 06:18.522
- Thought we could talk.
- OK.

06:18.736 --> 06:20.316
- Let's talk at lunch.
- Yeah.

06:21.085 --> 06:21.956
You ready?

06:36.950 --> 06:38.435
It's immaculate.

06:50.642 --> 06:52.120
The motor's back.

06:53.813 --> 06:55.572
- Any damage?
- Nah.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.880
It's been serviced, valeted,

06:59.000 --> 07:00.876
And they've even sent
round a nice case of Scotch

07:00.877 --> 07:02.720
in hope they don't get kneecapped.

07:07.557 --> 07:09.119
Do you want me to send someone 'round?

07:11.600 --> 07:12.679
No.

07:13.925 --> 07:15.392
Let's give them a job,

07:16.090 --> 07:17.545
see if they measure up.

07:17.742 --> 07:18.594
OK.

07:24.735 --> 07:26.440
We got the car back.

07:27.144 --> 07:28.629
No harm done.

07:30.697 --> 07:32.331
I love it when you wear this.

07:32.451 --> 07:33.596
You chose it,

07:33.942 --> 07:35.587
it's my lucky suit.

07:37.794 --> 07:38.885
You got meetings?

07:39.833 --> 07:43.404
Lawyers and planners today.

07:43.803 --> 07:45.240
Slow but sure.

07:46.946 --> 07:49.039
What's to stop us jumping on a plane,

07:49.283 --> 07:50.400
right now?

07:50.446 --> 07:51.955
No business.

07:52.075 --> 07:53.355
Just us.

08:02.431 --> 08:03.558
Victor.

08:03.599 --> 08:04.768
Yeah.

08:05.520 --> 08:06.552
What's the story?

08:06.569 --> 08:09.080
27 applications being considered.

08:09.104 --> 08:11.083
Ours is number 9 on the list.

08:11.567 --> 08:13.224
Wait to see how it goes.

08:14.023 --> 08:16.611
We'll meet and greet, fake and phony.

08:17.386 --> 08:20.093
Businessmen and hippies,
nothing in between.

08:21.083 --> 08:24.059
- What's the time frame?
- Should be done by lunch.

08:26.288 --> 08:27.994
Our men behaving themselves?

08:28.065 --> 08:29.944
They fucking better be.

08:30.403 --> 08:31.965
But if not, I'm here.

08:32.174 --> 08:33.289
OK.

08:34.964 --> 08:36.549
Be charming.

08:36.556 --> 08:38.423
I'm always fucking charming.

08:45.572 --> 08:48.351
The commercial license for Buckingham Gate.

08:49.001 --> 08:51.120
Gets final planning approval today.

08:51.159 --> 08:53.938
We become part of the establishment.

08:54.240 --> 08:55.876
Victor's babysitting the meeting.

08:57.408 --> 08:59.931
- You in the establishment?
- This is big leads.

08:59.961 --> 09:01.613
This means they can never

09:01.804 --> 09:03.217
hurt us again.

09:14.028 --> 09:15.518
You don't have to be here.

09:15.553 --> 09:16.990
You should take some time.

09:17.545 --> 09:19.786
And see this place go to the wall.

09:22.290 --> 09:23.751
We've drawn a line.

09:24.562 --> 09:25.921
Everything's behind us.

09:25.960 --> 09:29.004
We're a normal company, and
we do what normal companies do.

09:29.725 --> 09:31.395
Work hard but legitimate.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.103
We're already the best, but
we're going to be better.

09:35.736 --> 09:37.173
Good, I'm glad.

09:38.633 --> 09:39.748
What do we got?

09:41.626 --> 09:43.105
Right, um...

09:44.190 --> 09:45.880
Another hoarder house, boss.

09:45.884 --> 09:48.400
- Morning, Padraig.
- It's "Porrick".

09:48.441 --> 09:49.753
Morning, Porridge.

09:49.873 --> 09:50.964
Prick.

09:58.727 --> 10:00.265
I know it's dull,

10:00.527 --> 10:03.288
- but this is our bread and butter work.
- Yeah.

10:03.925 --> 10:06.984
- Cleaning dead people's shit.
- That's the job.

10:11.337 --> 10:12.964
I want to ask your advice.

10:13.190 --> 10:15.641
- Sure.
- I met this girl.

10:16.160 --> 10:17.638
- Oh, that's good.
- Yeah.

10:18.360 --> 10:19.743
It's early days.

10:20.435 --> 10:23.160
That's how every relationships start.

10:25.128 --> 10:26.439
We hit a...

10:27.137 --> 10:28.431
a tricky patch.

10:30.517 --> 10:31.919
But you got feelings for her?

10:32.223 --> 10:34.023
Yeah. I guess, yeah.

10:34.363 --> 10:35.872
Then you gotta stick at it.

10:42.258 --> 10:43.611
She's married.

10:43.880 --> 10:45.370
That's not good.

10:45.853 --> 10:48.757
Well, maybe it's convenient, you know,

10:48.954 --> 10:50.797
you can avoid commitment.

10:51.107 --> 10:52.634
She's married to Nelson.

10:59.120 --> 11:01.161
- Does anyone know?
- No.

11:02.556 --> 11:05.234
- I'm going to... I'm going to end it.
- Obviously.

11:05.280 --> 11:06.771
This is your problem.

11:06.891 --> 11:08.697
You're on your own.

11:11.498 --> 11:12.315
Look.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.022
Our stiff was a jazz cat.

11:15.249 --> 11:16.800
Bits of instruments too.

11:16.841 --> 11:18.637
Mouthpieces, finger buttons, valves,

11:18.643 --> 11:20.840
music composition books, programmes.

11:20.861 --> 11:22.000
He's beautiful.

11:22.363 --> 11:24.372
Yeah, he is.

11:24.700 --> 11:26.501
How do you get from there

11:27.074 --> 11:28.314
to this?

11:29.781 --> 11:31.158
Mental health.

11:31.730 --> 11:33.859
People get in a little bit of trouble,

11:33.895 --> 11:35.505
and they can't find a way out.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.992
The brief is to clear the place.
So be professional, do your job.

11:48.132 --> 11:50.047
300 quid? How did you get it?

11:50.267 --> 11:52.329
I found some drugs in my uncle's bad.

11:52.365 --> 11:54.243
Steven sold it for me.

11:54.715 --> 11:55.764
You're lying.

11:56.408 --> 11:58.078
It was cocaine I think.

11:59.252 --> 12:00.582
So what's wrong?

12:01.512 --> 12:03.164
I think he spiked my drink.

12:03.284 --> 12:04.655
I passed out.

12:06.742 --> 12:08.764
And this morning I got this chat.

12:09.517 --> 12:13.368
"Want to know what you did next?"

12:13.832 --> 12:16.241
- Is it from him?
- I don't remember anything.

12:16.265 --> 12:18.745
- "My favourite:) "
- You were really mashed.

12:19.019 --> 12:22.030
He keeps sending other
pictures worse each time.

12:22.084 --> 12:23.449
"You're moving well!"

12:23.480 --> 12:26.902
- God, you were doing a strip-tease!
- What if he doesn't stop there?

12:27.671 --> 12:30.372
What if he's got more?
What if he posts them?

12:31.487 --> 12:32.900
It's a badge of honour.

12:33.020 --> 12:34.475
There was this girl in Year 11,

12:34.493 --> 12:36.943
before you came. Total
dork. Everyone hating on her.

12:36.961 --> 12:38.947
Her boyfriend posted
photos of them doing it,

12:38.964 --> 12:41.400
and suddenly, like "what?",
little Miss Popular.

12:41.588 --> 12:44.748
Everyone loving her, everyone interested.

12:45.255 --> 12:47.151
Heard she got scouted to model.

12:47.716 --> 12:49.356
It's the 21st century, M.

12:49.398 --> 12:52.440
Everyone's bare naked
online, even fat people!

12:52.744 --> 12:54.914
So, this is good news?

12:54.926 --> 12:56.601
It's so "what news?".

12:56.721 --> 12:58.241
Can we do geography now?

13:04.775 --> 13:06.839
I tried to get him to come away somewhere.

13:08.150 --> 13:09.510
Just the two of us.

13:10.637 --> 13:12.181
Somewhere remote.

13:13.218 --> 13:14.954
How does that solve anything?

13:16.521 --> 13:18.405
Were you thinking of an accident?

13:19.956 --> 13:21.685
I don't want Nelson dead.

13:22.550 --> 13:23.742
He's my husband.

13:24.547 --> 13:25.840
What about us?

13:32.442 --> 13:33.247
I just...

13:33.283 --> 13:34.768
wanted to get Nelson out of the way,

13:34.774 --> 13:36.324
so Victor couldn't get to him.

13:37.952 --> 13:40.105
- He hasn't told him yet?
- No.

13:40.951 --> 13:42.621
He'll make us squirm,

13:42.853 --> 13:44.183
tease it out.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.562
It's much more fun that way.

13:47.051 --> 13:48.357
So that gives us what?

13:48.387 --> 13:49.740
A day? A week?

13:49.776 --> 13:51.767
I can't leave this in Victor's hands.

13:52.805 --> 13:54.421
- I'm gonna tell Nelson myself.
- No.

13:55.321 --> 13:56.895
He respects honesty.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.374
I'll talk to Victor.

13:58.494 --> 13:59.913
He's the problem.

14:01.881 --> 14:04.319
Just give me a couple of days, that's all.

14:05.363 --> 14:06.406
For what?

14:09.852 --> 14:11.212
I don't wanna know.

14:16.972 --> 14:18.575
Please be careful.

14:24.103 --> 14:25.814
We have to finish.

14:26.762 --> 14:28.599
You know that, don't you?

15:35.990 --> 15:37.558
Can I help you?

15:38.316 --> 15:39.520
This is lovely.

15:39.640 --> 15:42.640
It's 18 carat yellow gold with moon stones.

15:42.760 --> 15:44.124
Would you like to try it on?

15:44.360 --> 15:45.596
Yes, sure, why not?

15:53.311 --> 15:54.432
Sorry.

15:57.706 --> 15:58.934
I've got it.

16:02.680 --> 16:03.883
She's a new designer.

16:03.931 --> 16:06.143
Couple of years out of
Central Saint Martins.

16:14.002 --> 16:15.648
That's beautiful.

16:17.191 --> 16:18.950
Is it for a special occasion?

16:21.037 --> 16:22.772
Uh, no, I just...

16:23.106 --> 16:24.645
a little treat.

16:24.853 --> 16:25.897
I, uh...

16:26.560 --> 16:27.847
I've got a couple of kids,

16:27.880 --> 16:30.238
and a husband who works all hours,

16:30.530 --> 16:32.134
who I never see.

16:33.672 --> 16:35.336
Thought I'd spoil myself.

16:35.908 --> 16:37.172
Good for you.

16:40.781 --> 16:42.069
I'll take it.

16:42.432 --> 16:43.870
How would you like to pay?

17:06.462 --> 17:08.424
I thought we should meet.

17:14.005 --> 17:15.258
Thank you.

17:16.564 --> 17:17.655
Some milk,

17:17.858 --> 17:19.252
and Darjeeling for you.

17:19.289 --> 17:20.672
- Thanks.
- Enjoy.

17:28.997 --> 17:30.554
Why did you come into my shop?

17:31.001 --> 17:32.861
Wouldn't you want to know in my position?

17:34.453 --> 17:36.916
I deserve the insults
if you wanna fire them.

17:37.876 --> 17:39.224
No, I don't.

17:40.846 --> 17:42.336
How would that serve anyone.

17:43.857 --> 17:45.253
I'm sorry if you're hurt.

17:45.373 --> 17:47.870
I don't know you, I
don't wish you any harm.

17:48.048 --> 17:49.831
But I can't help you.

17:50.397 --> 17:52.413
Your marriage is between you and Jean.

17:52.663 --> 17:53.920
Yes, it is.

17:57.469 --> 17:59.604
I think I'm trying to decide

18:00.916 --> 18:02.997
whether it's worth fighting for.

18:05.680 --> 18:06.812
What do you think?

18:07.563 --> 18:08.840
I don't have an opinion.

18:08.960 --> 18:11.409
Oh, I think you're uniquely positioned.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.902
He's been under terrible pressure.

18:19.227 --> 18:20.909
Everyone's under pressure.

18:24.994 --> 18:26.127
It's just...

18:27.280 --> 18:29.895
the fear of what these
people might do to your family

18:29.907 --> 18:32.292
if they're prepared to kill
someone in front of him.

18:38.755 --> 18:40.263
You didn't know?

18:42.231 --> 18:43.322
No.

18:47.240 --> 18:49.260
My husband doesn't confide in me.

19:14.476 --> 19:15.651
Mom?

19:28.846 --> 19:30.009
Can I ask a question?

19:32.864 --> 19:34.355
So we're talking now?

19:34.641 --> 19:36.114
Shouldn't you be in school?

19:38.838 --> 19:39.720
What's wrong?

19:39.840 --> 19:42.511
I went to a party last night, and...

19:42.631 --> 19:44.634
- And what? Boy trouble again?
- Yeah.

19:45.385 --> 19:46.441
Sort of.

19:46.774 --> 19:47.716
Look,

19:48.724 --> 19:50.200
you shouldn't be talking to me.

19:50.233 --> 19:53.351
I would like to help, but not on this
one. You have to ask your parents.

19:55.676 --> 19:58.258
I never made a good
relationship decision in my life.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.852
Trust me, I'm not good at it.

20:38.621 --> 20:41.371
There were two elections in 1974,

20:41.408 --> 20:44.464
- February, and October.
- Argh, well, that's wrong,

20:44.483 --> 20:46.915
'cause there's one
election every five years.

20:46.945 --> 20:50.422
No, we do not have a
fixed term in this country.

20:50.672 --> 20:53.081
You could have an election
every week if you wanted to.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.760
What would be the point in that?

20:54.880 --> 20:56.914
There wouldn't be a fuckin'
point in it. I'm just saying,

20:56.927 --> 20:59.056
theoretically, you could if you had to.

20:59.747 --> 21:01.590
Politics is bollocks, ain't it?

21:02.001 --> 21:03.468
Yeah, bollocks.

21:03.694 --> 21:06.234
- Oh, fuck!
- 15 % of Buckingham Gate

21:06.246 --> 21:09.812
is set aside for low-rent
affordable commercial tenants.

21:10.407 --> 21:12.337
Well, that is punitive for you.

21:13.425 --> 21:14.648
I don't mind that.

21:15.833 --> 21:18.225
Well, as your lawyer, I
recommend you challenge it.

21:18.569 --> 21:20.477
There are 12 partners in this development

21:20.489 --> 21:23.125
and your exposure is
disproportionally high.

21:24.066 --> 21:26.112
It limits your potential for profit.

21:26.809 --> 21:28.837
Profit isn't everything, Peter.

21:30.327 --> 21:31.806
Explain, Victor.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.551
My brother was brought up in the north.

21:36.332 --> 21:37.698
He has a...

21:38.133 --> 21:40.727
"how many dinners can you eat" mentality.

21:41.997 --> 21:43.053
Sorry?

21:44.007 --> 21:46.154
We'll make good money from the tower.

21:47.113 --> 21:48.759
If we're not greedy,

21:49.087 --> 21:52.063
people might leave us alone
to get on with our business.

21:53.762 --> 21:54.853
Very good.

22:33.956 --> 22:35.453
Oh, that's impressive.

22:36.425 --> 22:37.391
Thank you.

22:39.418 --> 22:42.000
You're creating from scratch. It has...

22:42.047 --> 22:43.651
not many people get that chance.

22:44.009 --> 22:44.832
Well,

22:45.118 --> 22:46.615
it's not a living yet.

22:47.861 --> 22:49.149
I got sushi.

22:54.248 --> 22:55.641
We need to talk.

22:59.281 --> 22:59.992
Yeah,

23:00.187 --> 23:01.880
you must have so many questions.

23:06.932 --> 23:08.258
I got involved in

23:08.611 --> 23:09.837
something bad.

23:11.286 --> 23:13.733
- I got dragged into...
- They killed a man in front of you.

23:16.911 --> 23:18.370
- How d...
- Why didn't you tell me?

23:21.729 --> 23:23.842
That's not the kind of
thing you share over dinner.

23:33.368 --> 23:34.570
It's Nelson Clay.

23:36.920 --> 23:38.711
Well, you took me to his house!

23:38.744 --> 23:40.313
You weren't in danger then.

23:40.895 --> 23:41.973
He's a...

23:42.479 --> 23:44.797
an honourable guy in a... in a...

23:44.830 --> 23:46.000
fucked up sort of way.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.817
Is it that yo don't trust me

23:48.523 --> 23:49.882
or that you don't respect me?

23:49.920 --> 23:51.867
No, I trust and respect you

23:52.335 --> 23:54.240
more than anyone I've ever met.

23:56.398 --> 23:57.147
Hey.

23:59.717 --> 24:00.666
I love you.

24:01.024 --> 24:02.140
Are we safe?

24:03.127 --> 24:04.291
Me and the children?

24:05.160 --> 24:06.000
Yeah.

24:09.925 --> 24:11.170
There no more secrets?

24:12.578 --> 24:13.346
None.

24:13.828 --> 24:15.935
- I swear.
- You've told me everything?

24:17.800 --> 24:18.597
Yeah.

24:19.060 --> 24:20.042
Everything.

24:23.858 --> 24:25.346
Well, you didn't even blink.

24:28.231 --> 24:30.020
Well, I met Claire today.

24:36.812 --> 24:38.672
You can pick up your stuff from home.

24:39.569 --> 24:40.552
And then leave.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.476
The London property market is free money.

25:32.400 --> 25:35.046
Domestic is fine if you can
be bothered with the minutiae

25:35.060 --> 25:38.776
but commercial properties in
long term, is permanent wealth.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.130
Do you understand what I'm saying?

25:40.250 --> 25:42.038
- Yeah.
- Now, I want you

25:42.105 --> 25:44.810
to be more involved. But
you got to earn the right.

25:46.049 --> 25:47.900
Where are you at with Jean Bastière?

25:48.020 --> 25:49.828
Well his wife is making
me a couple of pieces.

25:49.857 --> 25:52.070
- She must be nearly done by now.
- Wrap up your business with her.

25:52.075 --> 25:53.802
We don't need any noise
around us right now.

25:54.141 --> 25:55.295
What about his brother?

25:55.357 --> 25:57.075
Leave them all alone.

26:02.374 --> 26:03.638
Buckingham Gate.

26:05.469 --> 26:08.208
One of the poorest street
in London back in the day.

26:10.287 --> 26:13.478
Now, it's money for generations.

26:13.598 --> 26:15.201
For the lucky few.

26:16.956 --> 26:18.139
For us.

26:22.260 --> 26:24.908
Victor, I'm taking Sonny to Portugal.

26:26.081 --> 26:27.760
I'm gonna take the time,

26:28.395 --> 26:30.584
spend the money to restore the place.

26:31.061 --> 26:32.611
Plant some olives.

26:33.941 --> 26:36.565
Now I rescued about 4,500 olive trees

26:36.575 --> 26:38.454
from some old place in Tuscany.

26:38.574 --> 26:40.519
We'll transplant them.

26:41.268 --> 26:42.565
For how long?

26:45.580 --> 26:46.611
For good.

26:53.084 --> 26:55.512
She knows nothing about
it, so say nothing, OK?

26:55.803 --> 26:58.088
I need to put the pieces in place first.

27:04.828 --> 27:06.993
What's your dream, Victor?

27:08.964 --> 27:10.585
Never really thought about it.

27:14.960 --> 27:16.291
Do you want this?

27:16.591 --> 27:17.392
Yeah.

27:18.848 --> 27:20.098
You ready?

27:25.230 --> 27:25.993
Yeah.

27:29.764 --> 27:30.952
Well, live right,

27:32.802 --> 27:34.405
be smart,

27:37.229 --> 27:38.603
you can have it.

27:41.298 --> 27:42.404
I will.

27:59.240 --> 28:01.673
- We're in the big leagues.
- Looks good, don't it?

28:01.720 --> 28:04.921
Everything pivots on this. Be smart.

28:21.549 --> 28:24.960
"I like your hair. Come closer. "

28:41.505 --> 28:42.788
Hello?

28:56.221 --> 28:57.514
Hello?

28:58.606 --> 29:00.562
Stop freaking me out.

29:20.100 --> 29:21.283
It's not funny.

29:21.306 --> 29:22.408
I didn't mean to scare you.

29:22.422 --> 29:24.488
Well you are. All of this, everything!

29:25.676 --> 29:27.107
You like a bit of fun, don't you?

29:27.120 --> 29:28.653
What else did you do?

29:30.665 --> 29:32.531
- Did you...
- Oh, I didn't touch you

29:32.583 --> 29:34.014
if that's what you're accusing me of.

29:34.667 --> 29:35.936
I'd never do that.

29:36.312 --> 29:38.793
- I'm your mate.
- You drugged my drink, took my clothes off

29:38.817 --> 29:41.598
- that's not how mates behave.
- It's just business.

29:42.877 --> 29:44.490
You've never needed money, have you?

29:45.687 --> 29:47.604
- For me it's everyday!
- I want you to delete

29:47.633 --> 29:49.937
- the photos.
- Nobody else ever had to see them.

29:53.066 --> 29:54.802
But I need you to come to The Mason's Arms,

29:54.826 --> 29:56.538
on Templeton Road at 6.

29:57.416 --> 29:58.175
Why?

29:59.244 --> 30:00.837
There's a bloke I want you to meet.

30:05.864 --> 30:07.061
The first time's tricky.

30:07.367 --> 30:09.528
But swear down, it's not so bad.

30:10.172 --> 30:12.562
The people I work with,
they know how to behave.

30:13.688 --> 30:14.885
I really liked you.

30:15.005 --> 30:17.008
And I like you, you're a nice kid.

30:17.842 --> 30:19.450
But if you're not there at 6,

30:19.956 --> 30:21.363
these go online.

30:40.511 --> 30:41.331
Hey.

30:41.720 --> 30:42.638
You as well.

30:42.758 --> 30:44.055
It's my lucky day.

30:44.679 --> 30:45.657
Two minutes?

30:45.924 --> 30:47.250
I've got a train to catch.

30:47.560 --> 30:48.424
Please.

30:49.907 --> 30:51.076
The clock's running.

30:56.532 --> 30:58.703
I'm sorry you had to go
through this with Julie.

30:59.556 --> 31:00.878
I would have warned you

31:01.321 --> 31:02.657
but I had no idea.

31:06.467 --> 31:07.321
Turn around.

31:08.318 --> 31:09.253
Come on.

31:09.969 --> 31:11.028
Turn around.

31:17.983 --> 31:19.567
I knew what I was doing.

31:20.845 --> 31:22.601
Well, it was my responsibility.

31:23.092 --> 31:24.829
Don't patronize me.

31:26.508 --> 31:28.010
There's no drama here.

31:28.244 --> 31:29.407
We had a laugh,

31:29.474 --> 31:30.800
played like it was real.

31:32.738 --> 31:35.643
You were a few hours of my
week, not a big part of my life.

31:39.378 --> 31:40.719
I cared for you.

31:41.792 --> 31:43.514
Me too. But...

31:44.372 --> 31:45.459
So what?

31:46.575 --> 31:48.693
In the bigger picture, so what?

31:49.233 --> 31:50.888
It wasn't going anywhere.

31:51.809 --> 31:52.844
It was...

31:54.709 --> 31:55.682
fun.

31:58.511 --> 31:59.756
Time's up.

32:02.760 --> 32:03.772
Where are you going?

32:05.094 --> 32:06.935
My mom died last week.

32:08.519 --> 32:09.468
Oh, that's...

32:09.588 --> 32:10.680
Shit.

32:11.320 --> 32:12.382
I'm so sorry.

32:13.059 --> 32:15.234
We bury her on Tuesday.

32:16.813 --> 32:18.139
Anything I can do?

32:19.824 --> 32:20.916
No, thanks.

33:48.627 --> 33:49.786
What do you want?

33:54.856 --> 33:56.111
Have you told him?

33:57.303 --> 33:58.710
He adores you.

33:59.940 --> 34:01.414
He won't thank you for it.

34:01.743 --> 34:03.384
You're only bringing him unhappiness.

34:03.398 --> 34:04.853
He values loyalty.

34:05.617 --> 34:07.038
I could be useful to you.

34:09.308 --> 34:10.811
You got nothing I want.

34:13.473 --> 34:15.987
He'd like you to wear the
black dress for him tonight.

34:17.012 --> 34:20.380
You've come all this way to deliver
a message about a black dress?

34:20.920 --> 34:22.127
That's his message.

34:26.835 --> 34:28.199
You've already told him.

34:30.322 --> 34:31.721
You've killed us.

34:51.496 --> 34:53.648
It's home study. Check with school.

34:54.478 --> 34:55.800
Well then why aren't you at home?

34:57.803 --> 34:58.809
What?

35:00.980 --> 35:03.045
Come on, honey, I've got a
client coming in a minute.

35:03.651 --> 35:05.168
How many clients have you got?

35:06.103 --> 35:07.186
Some.

35:07.978 --> 35:10.019
It's a start-up, takes time.

35:10.539 --> 35:13.135
Like Orla's mom training
to be a yoga teacher.

35:14.060 --> 35:15.243
Aisha's mom a writer.

35:15.258 --> 35:18.101
I'm not even sure if they're real
jobs. They're just rich and bored.

35:18.597 --> 35:20.133
Well, I am neither.

35:21.569 --> 35:22.752
What's going on?

35:24.145 --> 35:25.752
I went to a party last night.

35:26.498 --> 35:28.167
Well, I'm not an idiot.

35:28.181 --> 35:29.884
I knew you weren't to Orla's.

35:30.614 --> 35:31.817
Were you even with her?

35:35.585 --> 35:37.366
Why does everyone keep lying to me?

35:37.390 --> 35:40.566
It is very very hard not
to take it personally!

35:44.040 --> 35:46.634
I'm sorry, I've had a
horrible horrible day.

35:48.771 --> 35:49.682
Maddy.

35:52.993 --> 35:54.958
Ugh, Maddy, come on!

37:02.311 --> 37:05.060
- Oh, hi Michael.
- Hi.

37:05.312 --> 37:07.641
- Good to see you.
- You too.

37:08.656 --> 37:10.240
Come in.

37:19.977 --> 37:22.371
So, the pieces are through here.

37:27.272 --> 37:30.080
I've tried to keep the
lines as simple as possible.

37:30.095 --> 37:33.804
I mean, Hepplewhite to Ercol,
the fundamentals stay the same.

37:35.257 --> 37:36.980
It's beautiful.

37:39.347 --> 37:42.832
- That's like a single piece of wood.
- That was the intention.

37:44.798 --> 37:47.388
So, the other pieces will be be
finished in another day or so.

37:47.407 --> 37:49.000
Where would you like them delivered?

37:49.798 --> 37:51.251
I'll have someone collect them.

37:51.765 --> 37:52.809
OK.

37:56.920 --> 37:58.717
So I suppose this is goodbye.

38:01.452 --> 38:03.158
It's been a pleasure.

38:06.422 --> 38:07.786
Your hands...

38:08.748 --> 38:10.119
they're so soft.

38:10.984 --> 38:12.817
No callouses.

38:12.937 --> 38:15.612
- Well, give it time.
- Have dinner with me.

38:18.578 --> 38:20.099
You know I really am flattered.

38:20.144 --> 38:22.477
- I-I really am.
- Just a goodbye dinner.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.369
Nothing else.

38:28.424 --> 38:31.272
I'm s... I'm so sorry,
just let me deal with this.

38:34.060 --> 38:35.431
Yeah, what is it?

38:36.579 --> 38:39.280
- There's a guy up there with you.
- I'm with a client.

38:39.322 --> 38:41.933
- Get out of there now.
- This really isn't a good time.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.081
I swear to God, get the
fuck out of there now!

38:45.446 --> 38:46.794
Is everything all right?

38:47.288 --> 38:48.248
Yeah.

38:50.320 --> 38:52.989
- I think you're mistaken.
- Julie, listen.

38:53.734 --> 38:56.447
That guy is a killer.
He's Nelson Clay's brother.

38:56.480 --> 38:59.643
You put the phone down, and
get the fuck outta there.

39:02.892 --> 39:03.864
OK.

39:05.975 --> 39:08.282
Yeah, no, I'll deal
with this straight away.

39:08.813 --> 39:10.011
Thanks.

39:15.598 --> 39:18.699
I'm so sorry. I have to go,
there's a... a family emergency.

39:20.517 --> 39:22.289
- Nothing serious I hope.
- Oh, no.

39:22.324 --> 39:24.947
Not at all. Just, you
know, stuff with the kids.

39:25.448 --> 39:27.309
I will see you tonight?

39:28.244 --> 39:29.181
Yeah?

39:31.530 --> 39:32.759
8 o'clock?

39:33.259 --> 39:34.643
Of course.

39:36.449 --> 39:37.772
Yeah, I'll call you.

39:44.760 --> 39:45.976
After you.

40:01.699 --> 40:02.880
I'll see you tonight.

40:02.909 --> 40:04.108
Sure.

40:05.414 --> 40:07.525
Thanks for everything, Michael. Bye.

40:12.593 --> 40:15.134
- Come on.
- No, I am fine on my own!

40:15.160 --> 40:17.131
He knows who you are. His name is Victor.

40:17.149 --> 40:20.280
- He's very sick, very dangerous.
- What? I thought he was client?

40:20.400 --> 40:22.783
- You need protection.
- What? From them?

40:22.825 --> 40:24.429
Or from you and my husband?

40:24.677 --> 40:26.776
- Wait, wait, wait!
- You know what? Get off me!

40:27.241 --> 40:29.441
- Did he tell you his wife died?
- Yes!

40:29.829 --> 40:31.535
Did he tell you that he killed her

40:31.655 --> 40:33.789
and fucked her dead body for a week?

40:33.807 --> 40:35.399
And he did it to other girls too!

40:35.519 --> 40:38.315
- That's who you were kissing right now!
- No! You know, fuck you!

40:38.380 --> 40:41.158
I have done nothing to upset these people!

40:41.278 --> 40:43.418
You know, the more I am
involved with your family,

40:43.430 --> 40:45.088
the more I seem to need protection.

40:45.112 --> 40:46.776
Why is that, do you think?

41:42.272 --> 41:45.468
"Call from Dad"

41:46.810 --> 41:49.869
"Call from Dad"

41:52.372 --> 41:53.487
Where are you?

41:53.511 --> 41:56.529
I'm not angry, I'm just really worried.

41:57.561 --> 41:59.725
Could you please call me straight away?

42:00.888 --> 42:02.104
Please.

42:04.495 --> 42:05.890
Here she is.

42:10.451 --> 42:11.864
Where you been?

42:13.827 --> 42:14.971
Gerry.

42:15.480 --> 42:16.641
This is Maddy.

42:16.969 --> 42:18.842
She's been looking forward to meet you.

42:19.026 --> 42:20.827
Maddy, it's a pleasure.

42:23.934 --> 42:25.336
What would you like to drink?

42:26.022 --> 42:27.363
Do you like vodka?

42:42.097 --> 42:42.926
Hey!

42:43.046 --> 42:43.772
Hey!

42:44.243 --> 42:45.323
Stop!

42:48.698 --> 42:50.468
What did you and Maddy do last night?

42:50.504 --> 42:52.757
- We hung out at mine.
- Don't lie to me!

42:52.877 --> 42:54.469
She said you went to see a film.

42:54.660 --> 42:57.111
- Yeah, that too.
- Stop fucking around!

42:57.552 --> 42:59.031
I can't get a hold of her.

42:59.880 --> 43:00.986
Is she in trouble?

43:02.638 --> 43:03.747
Answer me!

43:04.702 --> 43:06.329
OK, she wasn't with me.

43:06.449 --> 43:07.826
You need to talk to Maddy.

43:07.946 --> 43:09.413
Where did she get this money?

43:09.746 --> 43:11.296
It's nothing to do with me.

43:11.630 --> 43:12.853
Please.

43:16.377 --> 43:17.969
She went to a party.

43:17.993 --> 43:20.360
A friend of mine has got
a flat around the corner.

43:20.563 --> 43:22.191
It's really smart.

43:22.828 --> 43:24.325
I can show you.

43:28.350 --> 43:30.914
- She knows the drill, doesn't she?
- She knows.

43:32.179 --> 43:33.598
Why don't we go now?

43:35.154 --> 43:37.027
I'll just go to the bathroom.

43:39.287 --> 43:41.517
Don't even think of running away.

43:44.993 --> 43:46.526
I'm waiting right here.

43:46.865 --> 43:49.614
If you're not out in two
minutes, I'm coming in.

44:12.903 --> 44:15.294
Dad, please, I've done something stupid.

44:58.291 --> 44:59.686
What are you doing?

45:00.777 --> 45:02.006
Trust me.

45:04.003 --> 45:05.458
I'm your husband.

45:08.940 --> 45:10.317
Don't get spooked.

45:11.641 --> 45:13.644
I'm probably more nervous than you are.

45:14.425 --> 45:16.131
One more drink please.

45:18.354 --> 45:20.304
I've never done this before.

45:26.202 --> 45:28.259
- Get your fucking hands off her!
- Take it easy, friend.

45:28.271 --> 45:29.596
I'm her father.

45:29.631 --> 45:31.366
You're going nowhere.

45:31.486 --> 45:34.448
What's a grown man doing giving
alcohol to a 13-year-old girl?

45:34.466 --> 45:36.041
He's the one who took the pictures.

45:36.065 --> 45:38.109
- Give me your phone.
- Make me an offer.

45:38.110 --> 45:39.666
Don't play games, kid!

45:41.151 --> 45:42.916
The pictures are already out there.

45:43.166 --> 45:46.004
There are people spanking
on them right now.

45:47.459 --> 45:50.208
You better hope not, you sack of shit!

45:50.458 --> 45:52.962
If that's true, I will find you,

45:53.082 --> 45:55.466
and I'll cut your fucking balls off!

45:55.472 --> 45:57.303
Dad, it's enough.

46:07.148 --> 46:08.353
Come on.

46:23.290 --> 46:24.870
Just tell me.

46:25.448 --> 46:27.088
Where are we going?

46:28.775 --> 46:31.142
Well, that would ruin the surprise.

46:58.680 --> 47:00.521
Does Mom know about the pictures?

47:01.976 --> 47:03.747
I've tried to tell her.

47:05.125 --> 47:06.633
Can we keep it to ourselves?

47:07.539 --> 47:08.433
No.

47:09.889 --> 47:12.197
We tell each other the truth, from now.

47:12.680 --> 47:14.141
However painful.

47:19.841 --> 47:21.093
Where did you get the money?

47:25.601 --> 47:27.160
Did they make you do anything?

47:27.169 --> 47:29.221
It's not what you think, I promise.

47:30.062 --> 47:31.886
I sold something, that's all.

47:35.422 --> 47:36.340
OK.

47:39.400 --> 47:40.741
Are you going to work?

47:40.800 --> 47:42.344
No, I...

47:44.600 --> 47:46.203
I can't come in right now.

47:47.163 --> 47:48.880
Things are not great.

47:49.805 --> 47:51.683
Nobody's fault but mine.

47:52.267 --> 47:54.819
I love you, and Oliver, and Mom.

47:56.596 --> 47:58.010
We're gonna be all right.

48:51.637 --> 48:52.520
Hi.

48:52.640 --> 48:54.105
I'm not coming for dinner.

48:54.135 --> 48:55.459
I know who you are.

48:55.870 --> 48:57.120
That's a shame.

48:57.289 --> 48:58.577
What were you doing?

48:58.697 --> 49:00.646
I was enjoying myself.

49:01.511 --> 49:02.911
I didn't have to be me.

49:03.126 --> 49:04.426
Did you like me?

49:06.173 --> 49:07.747
When I was Michael?

49:10.037 --> 49:11.629
I will never see you again.

49:12.034 --> 49:13.686
Well, if that's what you want.

49:17.275 --> 49:18.820
But I will see you.

50:07.726 --> 50:09.509
Take the blindfold off.

50:45.882 --> 50:47.146
It's for you.

50:53.145 --> 50:54.200
You OK?

50:54.320 --> 50:55.804
Where did you think I was taking you?

51:04.600 --> 51:06.760
You're a miserable drinking
companion, you know that?

51:06.805 --> 51:07.997
I fucked up.

51:08.391 --> 51:10.173
That's an understatement.

51:14.400 --> 51:16.400
Sonny was more than a liaison, you know.

51:16.520 --> 51:18.563
Don't compare your

51:19.499 --> 51:22.081
humping in a cupboard to my marriage.

51:22.945 --> 51:25.068
We didn't hump in a cupboard.

51:26.797 --> 51:27.906
We humped

51:28.026 --> 51:29.617
in lots of other places.

51:30.679 --> 51:32.720
And if Victor hadn't found out,

51:33.120 --> 51:35.073
we might have had a chance.

51:37.756 --> 51:39.676
I've been trying to deal with it.

51:40.833 --> 51:42.044
How?

51:47.178 --> 51:48.167
Kill him

51:48.704 --> 51:50.302
before he talks to Nelson.

51:50.725 --> 51:52.812
You'd stroll up,

51:53.653 --> 51:55.299
finish him, and

51:55.651 --> 51:57.142
Nelson would never know?

51:58.024 --> 52:00.582
You know what? Feel free to help, any time.

52:01.360 --> 52:03.355
How come it's all on me? Uh?

52:04.595 --> 52:06.169
It's you Victor hates.

52:14.983 --> 52:16.307
He sent me this.

52:19.883 --> 52:21.713
You're kidding me. He was at the house?

52:23.585 --> 52:25.743
Why does this happen to us?

52:26.913 --> 52:28.642
It's our inheritance.

52:32.118 --> 52:33.728
Victor has to die.

52:34.280 --> 52:36.077
He's a danger to everyone.

52:40.600 --> 52:42.576
- I'll kill him.
- No.

52:45.439 --> 52:47.585
Nelson will kill him for us.
