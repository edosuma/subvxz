<i> Mr. Han,</i>

00:07.908 --> 00:11.343
my proposal won't just benefit
my business here in America

00:11.412 --> 00:14.413

profits of Han Overseas,

00:14.482 --> 00:17.049

Thomas Kent didn't come

00:58.125 --> 01:00.225
He grew up
on the streets,

scratching and clawing
for everything he has now.

he has a lot more

Kent called and asked for me.

No. You-you need to go home.

07:33.805 --> 07:35.972
of stealing a watch
from him last night.

07:36.041 --> 07:37.640
Which doesn't make sense,

07:37.709 --> 07:39.809
to steal with all the money
she makes here.

07:39.878 --> 07:41.745
He told me not
to call the police.

07:41.813 --> 07:44.114
And then he sent me that
to show Sasha.

07:44.149 --> 07:46.750
Did Kent hire Nicole

07:46.818 --> 07:48.284
Mm, Kent just hired
Nicole last night

07:48.353 --> 07:50.387

to entertain guests.

Sasha's the only girl

Oh, when he called for her
last night though,

07:56.795 --> 08:00.363
she was already booked, but then
she canceled to see him.

he's forcing you to be here.

10:55.907 --> 10:57.607
All you got to do
is say the word

10:57.676 --> 11:00.043
and you can leave with us;
you don't have to play his game.

11:02.147 --> 11:03.513
I'm good.

11:05.717 --> 11:07.584
A place like this
must be covered by, uh,

11:07.652 --> 11:09.319
theft insurance, no?

11:09.387 --> 11:10.587
Yeah, you know,

11:10.655 --> 11:13.523
the watch was given to me
as a gift, last night.

11:13.592 --> 11:15.058
And it has, uh,

11:15.126 --> 11:17.060
sentimental value,
so I'm not interested

11:17.128 --> 11:18.795
in having it
replaced or covered.

11:18.863 --> 11:21.764
You just received
the watch last night?
Okay look.

11:21.833 --> 11:25.635
You're so worried about
Nicole being stuck here.

11:25.704 --> 11:28.071
I am sure that she would be
more than happy to leave

11:29.574 --> 11:31.641
if the watch were
to come back in my possession

11:31.710 --> 11:34.110

7:00pm?

11:35.847 --> 11:37.113
Mm-hmm.

11:37.182 --> 11:39.382
How can we trust
Nicole will leave at 7:00?

11:41.353 --> 11:43.553
Because these girls
aren't worth keeping.

11:43.622 --> 11:45.989
I mean, sure they...

11:46.057 --> 11:47.323
they look good
and they...

11:47.392 --> 11:49.359
smell nice,
but at the end of the day,

11:49.427 --> 11:52.161
they're just whores and liars.

11:52.230 --> 11:55.231

They wouldn't even exist

11:55.300 --> 11:57.000

You have until 7:00.

12:15.754 --> 12:17.320

12:17.389 --> 12:18.554
that his relationship with Sasha

12:18.623 --> 12:20.323
was a transaction and not real.

12:20.392 --> 12:21.724
Yeah, he seemed embarrassed.

12:21.793 --> 12:24.394
Betrayed almost.

12:24.462 --> 12:27.230
Kent said he just received
the watch last night.

12:27.299 --> 12:29.465
Sasha cancelled
the booking to be with him.

12:29.534 --> 12:30.933
Uncharacteristically.
Mm-hmm.

12:31.002 --> 12:32.635
It's like she knew

12:32.704 --> 12:34.737
that Kent was gonna
be given that watch.

12:34.806 --> 12:36.372
Yeah, meaning she planned
to steal it.

12:36.441 --> 12:37.640
Which means somehow she knew

12:37.709 --> 12:39.175
that he'd be given it
last night.

12:39.244 --> 12:42.045
Plus, I mean,
Sasha makes good money.
(phone ringing)

12:42.113 --> 12:43.579
Doesn't make sense
for her to steal.

12:43.648 --> 12:46.816
Yeah, unless the watch
is more than just a watch.

12:46.885 --> 12:48.851
Oliver, what'd
you find?

12:48.920 --> 12:50.987
OLIVER:

12:51.056 --> 12:53.022
Sasha and what looks
to be Nicole's son.

12:53.091 --> 12:55.158
It was geotagged
to Nicole's condo.

12:55.226 --> 12:56.492
We're headed there now.

12:56.561 --> 12:58.428
Since Nicole has a son,
she would have needed

12:58.496 --> 12:59.896
a babysitter last night.

12:59.964 --> 13:01.497

Nicole doesn't show up to
relieve her of her duties.

13:07.105 --> 13:08.237
Meet you here?

13:08.306 --> 13:10.306
Send the address.
(engine turns over)

13:14.979 --> 13:16.979
(baby cooing)

13:18.083 --> 13:20.683
WOMAN:
Aw... Ooh.

13:23.655 --> 13:24.887
Yes?

13:24.956 --> 13:27.623
Hi. I'm Oliver Yates,
this Zara Hallam.
Hi.

13:27.692 --> 13:29.425
We work for
Crisis Resolution.

13:29.494 --> 13:31.394
I-Is there a crisis?

13:31.463 --> 13:32.929
Maybe.

13:32.997 --> 13:34.864
We're, uh, looking for a
woman named Sasha Levant.

13:34.933 --> 13:36.366
Sasha?

13:36.434 --> 13:38.968
I haven't talked with her since
they left for work last night.

13:39.037 --> 13:41.170
Are you Zak's
babysitter?
Nicole was supposed to

13:41.239 --> 13:42.872
come home this morning,
but she called

13:42.941 --> 13:45.808
and said she was
running late... what?

13:45.877 --> 13:49.278
We both know Nicole couldn't
have called you this morning.

13:49.347 --> 13:50.580
But someone must have.

13:50.648 --> 13:53.349
Otherwise, you'd be a lot more
concerned than you are

13:53.418 --> 13:55.418
that she hasn't
shown up yet.

13:55.487 --> 13:57.220
Zak looks sleepy.

13:57.288 --> 13:58.955
Do you want to go put
him down for a nap

13:59.023 --> 14:00.189
and maybe we can talk?

14:00.225 --> 14:01.891
I'll be right back.

14:07.532 --> 14:09.165
Who are you?

14:09.234 --> 14:10.767
Whoa! Whoa whoa--

14:10.835 --> 14:12.168
(gasps)

14:12.237 --> 14:14.137
(panting)

14:14.205 --> 14:15.705
Sasha!

14:19.577 --> 14:21.310
(gasps)
Sasha... Sasha!

14:23.681 --> 14:25.348
Hey, hey, hey. Sasha.

14:25.417 --> 14:27.650
We're not here to hurt you.
You're with him,
aren't you?

14:27.719 --> 14:29.452
You're with Kent.
No, no. No,
we're not.

14:29.521 --> 14:31.287
My name is Eric Beaumont,
I'm a negotiator.

14:31.356 --> 14:33.356
This is Cynthia Walker.
Your boss,
Janelle, hired us.

14:33.425 --> 14:35.124
Yeah, we know you're
scared for Nicole, okay?

14:35.193 --> 14:37.427
We also know that you
stole the watch from Kent.

14:37.495 --> 14:38.828
You cancelled a
date to make sure

14:38.897 --> 14:40.463
you were Kent last night.

14:40.532 --> 14:42.598
How did you know he was
gonna be gifted the watch?

14:43.668 --> 14:46.335
I... I don't know.

14:46.404 --> 14:48.137
Was it for somebody else?

14:48.206 --> 14:49.539
It doesn't matter, okay?

14:49.607 --> 14:51.474
I can't give it back,
it is my only way out.

14:51.543 --> 14:52.875
Only way out of what?

14:52.944 --> 14:54.444
The escort world?

14:54.512 --> 14:55.678
Okay, I can't-can't talk
about this. Please.

14:55.747 --> 14:57.180
will you just--
Come on, just let me go.

14:57.248 --> 14:59.182
If you don't let us to help,
we have to call the police.

14:59.250 --> 15:00.750
You have the one
thing that Kent wants.

15:00.819 --> 15:04.287
No... No, please.
Please-- (stammers)

15:04.355 --> 15:06.522
Why don't you want us
to call the police?

15:06.591 --> 15:09.625
Because this is their fault.

15:10.695 --> 15:12.995
You're working for them.

15:16.910 --> 15:18.744
A confidential informant?
I'm...

15:18.812 --> 15:21.046
I'm so sorry, Janelle,
I didn't have a choice.

15:21.115 --> 15:22.614
Working for the police.

15:22.683 --> 15:25.017
I got stopped on my way
home from a party

15:25.085 --> 15:27.419
and they found coke
in my purse.

15:27.488 --> 15:28.987
Coke?

15:29.056 --> 15:31.690
But we test you,
like every month.

15:31.759 --> 15:32.924
How the--
It wasn't mine,
okay?

15:32.993 --> 15:34.559
I don't know how
it got in there.

15:34.628 --> 15:36.895
The coke, it was in
separate bags, so...

15:36.964 --> 15:39.731
So the cops charged you
with intent to traffic.

15:39.800 --> 15:42.100
Why didn't you come to me?

15:42.169 --> 15:43.869
I could have helped.

15:43.937 --> 15:45.270
That's what I'm here for.

15:45.339 --> 15:46.605
I know.

15:46.673 --> 15:48.874
But the police said
that if I told anyone

15:48.942 --> 15:50.108
they'd prosecute me.

15:50.177 --> 15:53.378
Look, all I care about
is just getting Nicole back.

15:53.447 --> 15:56.148
Me too.

15:56.216 --> 15:59.317
I'm sorry this happened to you.

15:59.386 --> 16:00.919
Anything you need.

16:00.988 --> 16:02.821
SASHA:<i> It's my fault</i>
<i> Nicole's kidnapped.</i>

16:02.890 --> 16:04.389
I got her into
this business.

16:04.458 --> 16:06.425
Sasha, Nicole wouldn't
have been kidnapped

16:06.493 --> 16:09.061
if as a CI, you weren't
forced to steal a watch.

16:09.129 --> 16:10.996
The detective in
charge, Peterson,

16:11.065 --> 16:12.898
promised to
drop the charges

16:12.966 --> 16:14.900
if I worked as a CI
to bring Kent down.

16:14.968 --> 16:17.469
Why do they want
to bring Kent down?

16:17.538 --> 16:18.804
I-I don't know.

16:18.872 --> 16:20.372
I had to report
on things I saw

16:20.441 --> 16:22.040
when I was with him.

16:22.109 --> 16:23.775
People he met,
things he did.

16:23.844 --> 16:25.177
I just never knew why.

16:25.245 --> 16:27.446
What was last night's job about?

16:27.514 --> 16:29.815
Peterson got word that...

16:29.883 --> 16:32.284
Kent was meeting with Zhang Han.

16:32.352 --> 16:34.920
Some guy from Hong Kong.

16:34.988 --> 16:36.955
He said that
at some point,

16:37.024 --> 16:39.524
Han would give
Kent a gift.

16:39.593 --> 16:41.526
He didn't know what
and that I needed to steal it.

16:41.595 --> 16:43.361
And that was the watch.

16:43.430 --> 16:45.197
But you never gave it
to Peterson.

16:45.265 --> 16:47.265
I told him
I couldn't hand it over

16:47.334 --> 16:48.834
until he got Nicole
out of there.

16:48.902 --> 16:52.704
But he said he couldn't
save Nicole because

16:52.773 --> 16:55.307
it would jeopardize
something bigger.

16:56.844 --> 16:59.444
ZARA:<i> So, are you going to tell</i>
<i> me what happened back there?</i>

16:59.513 --> 17:00.679
What do you mean?

17:00.747 --> 17:02.180
You know what I mean.

17:02.249 --> 17:03.882
With Sasha and the gun?

17:03.951 --> 17:07.853
You disarmed her
like a pro.

17:07.921 --> 17:09.287
Look.

17:09.356 --> 17:11.656
I believe in Cri/Res's
policy of nonviolence

17:11.725 --> 17:12.991
as much as anybody.

17:13.060 --> 17:14.459
But the people we go up against?

17:14.528 --> 17:15.660
They don't.
Yeah,

17:15.729 --> 17:17.662
but that's always been the case.

17:17.731 --> 17:18.897
Why now?

17:18.966 --> 17:20.999
I don't know,
maybe I-I just got tired

17:21.068 --> 17:22.901
of feeling like a sitting duck.

17:22.970 --> 17:24.669
Zara, these people,
they-they hold

17:24.738 --> 17:26.771
zero value for human life.

17:26.840 --> 17:27.973
So what?

17:28.041 --> 17:30.142
You're now taking
self-defense classes

17:30.210 --> 17:31.710
so you can
beat up bad guys?

17:31.778 --> 17:33.879
I took a class

17:33.947 --> 17:35.547
and it wasn't
to beat up bad guys.

17:35.616 --> 17:38.583
I'm trying
to protect myself, okay?

17:38.652 --> 17:40.085
ERIC:
Oliver, did you
Trying to protect us.

17:40.154 --> 17:41.920
pull info on Sasha's
handler at Seattle PD?

17:41.989 --> 17:43.155
Sure did. Here you go.

17:43.223 --> 17:44.523
Take a look.

17:44.591 --> 17:46.024
Detective Gary Peterson.

17:46.093 --> 17:47.959
Mid-40's, Seattle PD
since his 20's.

17:48.028 --> 17:49.161
Highly decorated.

17:49.229 --> 17:51.129
And took a six month
leave of absence last year

17:51.198 --> 17:52.697
after his son died.

17:52.766 --> 17:54.766
A grief-fueled cop
could be dangerous.
Hmm.

17:54.835 --> 17:56.401
Yeah, let's
look into that.

17:56.470 --> 17:58.904
I'm gonna go
pay him a visit.
Someone like Peterson

17:58.972 --> 18:01.039
won't share information
on a covert operation.

18:01.108 --> 18:02.641
I don't expect
him to share.

18:02.709 --> 18:04.543
I expect him trade.

18:04.611 --> 18:05.844
Okay, Zara, Cynthia.

18:05.913 --> 18:08.446
Kent had dinner with a
Zhang Han last night.

18:08.515 --> 18:10.815
We need to know what
Kent's into, so...

18:10.884 --> 18:12.217
dig up what
you can on Han.

18:12.286 --> 18:14.553
And me?
You're gonna
take Sasha.

18:14.621 --> 18:16.288
Get her to get
you the watch.

18:16.356 --> 18:18.690
See if you can figure out why
it's so important to Kent.

18:18.759 --> 18:22.294
Escorting an escort,
I can do that.

18:34.341 --> 18:35.473
Hey, I'm Detective Peterson.

18:35.542 --> 18:37.242
What can I do you for?
Eric Beaumont,

18:37.311 --> 18:39.344
private negotiator.

18:39.413 --> 18:41.780
A woman, Nicole Bell,

18:41.848 --> 18:43.982
has been kidnapped
and I was hired to help

18:44.051 --> 18:46.318
get her back-- I think,
I think you're aware of this.

18:46.386 --> 18:47.953
Why would I be aware of that?

18:48.021 --> 18:50.522
Because Sasha Levant told you.

18:52.359 --> 18:54.059
You know her.

18:54.127 --> 18:56.895
Confidential informant
working a case for you?

19:00.968 --> 19:02.234
Where is she?

19:02.302 --> 19:03.702
Well, I can tell you that,

19:03.770 --> 19:05.670
but first, I need to know
why bringing down

19:05.739 --> 19:07.138
the owner of a chain pharmacy's

19:07.207 --> 19:08.473
so important
you're willing to risk

19:08.542 --> 19:10.609
Nicole's life
in order to do it.

19:10.677 --> 19:12.811
You have no idea what
you've gotten yourself into.

19:12.879 --> 19:15.413
I could arrest you right now
on obstruction of justice.
Yeah, but--

19:15.482 --> 19:17.282
if you did that
you'd never get your hands

19:17.351 --> 19:20.252
on what Sasha
stole from Thomas Kent.

19:20.320 --> 19:22.621
Look, I'm-I'm not trying
to be difficult, Detective.

19:22.689 --> 19:26.591
You have information I want
and I have information you want.

19:26.660 --> 19:28.093
Let's, let's help
each other out here.

19:30.163 --> 19:31.796
(knocking)

19:35.335 --> 19:37.202
Sasha, are you okay?

19:37.271 --> 19:39.237
Yeah, I'm fine,
uh, everything is fine.

19:39.306 --> 19:41.206
I'm just, I'm just here
for a sec.

19:41.275 --> 19:43.541
Where's Zak?
He's sleeping.

19:43.610 --> 19:46.344
Last time you were with this
man, you had a gun on him.

19:46.380 --> 19:47.512
Are you sure everything is okay?

19:47.581 --> 19:48.980
Please, Marta, just...

19:49.049 --> 19:51.116
Just give us
a minute, okay?

19:51.184 --> 19:52.651
Please?

20:07.901 --> 20:09.768
That's it?

20:09.836 --> 20:11.136
Okay great.

20:12.472 --> 20:13.605
Hey.

20:13.674 --> 20:15.073
I just want to help.

20:15.142 --> 20:18.009
I-I can't give this to the cops
until I know is Nicole safe.

20:18.078 --> 20:19.678
This watch,
i-it represents her life.

20:19.746 --> 20:22.580
I know.
Your buddy's talking
to Peterson.

20:22.649 --> 20:24.916
Trying to get information
to help free Nicole.

20:24.985 --> 20:26.885
Peterson doesn't care
about Nicole.

20:26.953 --> 20:30.722
But Eric does and he's the best
negotiator in the world.

20:30.791 --> 20:33.024
He knows how to give people
what they want.

20:33.093 --> 20:35.827
Sounds a bit like
being an escort.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.966
(sighs)

20:42.035 --> 20:44.035
Mm. Beautiful.

20:50.977 --> 20:53.278
(phone line trilling)

20:53.347 --> 20:54.846
MAN (on phone):
Seattle Police Department.

20:54.915 --> 20:56.681
Now, let me get this straight.

20:56.750 --> 20:58.650
So I tell you what
this is all about,

20:58.719 --> 21:01.353
and you help me to
get in touch with Sasha?

21:01.421 --> 21:02.887
Well, I can't make her
come to you,

21:02.956 --> 21:04.222
but I will help you get
what you need.

21:04.291 --> 21:06.191
It's what my company does.
We're, uh--

21:06.259 --> 21:07.559
We're pretty good at it.

21:07.627 --> 21:09.594
(cell phone ringing)

21:09.663 --> 21:13.365
Yeah, Peterson.

21:13.433 --> 21:16.067
She said what?

21:16.136 --> 21:17.902
Great.

21:19.973 --> 21:21.172
Yes, thank you.
(snaps fingers)

21:21.241 --> 21:23.475
Let's get them over there
right away?

21:23.543 --> 21:24.809
Good news?

21:24.878 --> 21:27.312
I appreciate your offer to help,

21:27.381 --> 21:30.382
but I think we'll keep this
in-house after all.

21:30.450 --> 21:32.050
And just to make sure
you stay out of our way,

21:32.119 --> 21:35.153
I'm gonna hold you here
for 24 hours.

21:35.222 --> 21:38.123
You know, for questioning.

21:40.694 --> 21:43.862
Jong Han.
No criminal record.

21:43.930 --> 21:45.630
No warrants out for his arrest.

21:45.699 --> 21:47.766
No suspicious associates.
Mm.

21:47.834 --> 21:50.135
And as the number two shipping
magnate in Hong Kong,

21:50.203 --> 21:52.070
he's worth over $800 million.

21:52.139 --> 21:54.572
What does his company ship?

21:54.641 --> 21:56.574
It looks like mostly auto parts.

21:56.643 --> 21:58.676
Mainly to North America.
Mm.

21:58.745 --> 22:01.780
So, why would a Chinese exporter
of auto parts be meeting

22:01.848 --> 22:04.282
with an American owner
of a chain of pharmacies?

22:05.886 --> 22:07.552
Hmm.

22:07.621 --> 22:09.287
What? What is it?

22:09.356 --> 22:11.322
There's a microchip inside.

22:11.391 --> 22:13.491
A microchip? For what?

22:13.560 --> 22:15.593
For, like, Wi-Fi. Data.

22:15.662 --> 22:17.495
Don't mind us.

22:17.564 --> 22:19.297
Just off to the park.
Okay.

22:19.366 --> 22:21.666
Bye, Zak.
Have fun, sweetie.

22:21.735 --> 22:24.969
This watch is set
to receive messages.

22:25.038 --> 22:27.772
Wait a second.
This is not a watch at all.

22:27.841 --> 22:29.574
It's a communication device.

22:29.643 --> 22:31.743
That's why Kent wants it
back by 7:00 p.m.

22:31.812 --> 22:33.845
He's expecting information
to be sent to him then.

22:33.914 --> 22:36.147
We gotta get this back to Eric.

22:36.216 --> 22:38.283
(horns honking)
(indistinct shouting)

22:38.351 --> 22:39.617
Hold on.

22:39.686 --> 22:42.120
MAN (shouting):
Hey, I'm talking to you!

22:42.189 --> 22:44.189
Come on, let's go!

22:44.257 --> 22:46.458
You, out of there,
right now!

22:46.526 --> 22:49.127
All right, everybody,
move, move, move.

22:49.196 --> 22:50.762
Sasha, we gotta go.

22:57.237 --> 22:58.236
OFFICER (shouting):
Police!

22:58.305 --> 23:00.505
Let me see your hands!

23:17.294 --> 23:19.427
PETERSON:
<i> Where is it?</i>

23:19.496 --> 23:20.962
Where's the what?

23:21.031 --> 23:22.030
PETERSON:
The watch.

23:22.099 --> 23:25.233
So, you don't know where it is?

23:25.302 --> 23:27.302
And Sasha won't tell you?

23:27.371 --> 23:30.705
Sorry, Detective, I-I truly
don't know where it is.

23:30.774 --> 23:32.841
Well, you better hope
she gives it up.

23:32.910 --> 23:35.210
Because it's not just Nicole's
life on the line here.

23:35.279 --> 23:37.679
What do you mean?

23:37.748 --> 23:41.049
I'm sure you're aware North
America is in the midst

23:41.118 --> 23:43.251
of a fentanyl epidemic.
Yeah.

23:43.320 --> 23:47.122
Thomas Kent is the number-one
distributor of fentanyl

23:47.191 --> 23:48.690
in the state of Washington.

23:48.759 --> 23:50.992
It's a pain inhibitor
used in the hospitals

23:51.061 --> 23:52.694
under extreme supervision.

23:52.763 --> 23:54.196
Only now it's getting
sold on the streets.

23:54.264 --> 23:57.899
Jong Han owns the fentanyl trade
in China.

23:57.968 --> 24:00.468
He and Kent have reached a deal
that would see Jong supply Kent

24:00.537 --> 24:02.671
with huge amounts of the drug.

24:02.739 --> 24:06.708
Han has used lavish gifts
to close his past deals.

24:06.777 --> 24:08.910
Which is why we believe
the watch Sasha stole

24:08.979 --> 24:10.312
contains the location and time

24:10.380 --> 24:12.914
this exchange will
take place tonight.

24:12.983 --> 24:14.449
OLIVER:
But it doesn't have

24:14.518 --> 24:15.717
the information you want on it.

24:15.786 --> 24:17.552
Not yet.
What are you talking about?

24:17.621 --> 24:18.887
Well, the watch is essentially

24:18.956 --> 24:21.356
a communication device
set to receive messages.

24:21.425 --> 24:22.857
And considering Kent
wants it back by 7:00,

24:22.926 --> 24:25.026
it stands to reason that's
when the information that

24:25.095 --> 24:28.463
you're looking for will be sent.
(cell phone ringing)

24:30.133 --> 24:32.968
Eric.
Where is it?

24:33.036 --> 24:34.169
I'm working on it.

24:34.238 --> 24:35.570
Things are moving
in the right direction.

24:35.639 --> 24:36.771
KENT:
No, I don't need things

24:36.840 --> 24:38.306
to move in the right direction.

24:38.375 --> 24:41.576
I need you to tell me
I'm gonna have my watch by 7:00.

24:41.645 --> 24:43.578
Or what?
KENT:
Or what?

24:45.749 --> 24:48.216
Say hello to Mr. Beaumont.
Hello?

24:48.285 --> 24:50.585
Nicole, are you okay?

24:50.654 --> 24:52.287
Or those are gonna be the last
words Nicole ever says.

24:56.126 --> 24:58.026
You know, if Kent doesn't get
that watch back soon,

24:58.095 --> 24:59.728
he'll have to tell Han.

24:59.796 --> 25:02.364
Deal will be off, you won't
have a deal to bust.

25:02.399 --> 25:03.665
OLIVER: Let us talk to Sasha,
find out where the watch is,

25:03.734 --> 25:05.100
and take it back to Kent.

25:05.168 --> 25:06.935
ERIC: Sasha's never gonna
tell<i> you</i> where it is.

25:07.004 --> 25:09.771
You've broken too many promises.
She doesn't trust you.

25:15.679 --> 25:17.479
SASHA:
He's listening?

25:17.547 --> 25:19.014
Uh, yes, he is.

25:19.082 --> 25:21.216
But you need to trust me.

25:21.285 --> 25:23.084
You tell us where
the watch is...

25:23.153 --> 25:24.653
I tell you where it is right
now, and Peterson knows.

25:24.721 --> 25:27.489
I said I can't give it
to the cops until she's safe.

25:27.557 --> 25:28.823
Okay, and she will be.

25:28.892 --> 25:31.226
You don't know that.
You can't trust him.

25:33.230 --> 25:35.630
It's not just Peterson you don't
trust, is it?

25:36.867 --> 25:38.033
It's Eric, too.

25:38.101 --> 25:39.968
Why? Um...

25:40.037 --> 25:44.139
Sasha, my whole job is
based on trust.

25:44.207 --> 25:46.007
Um, with clients, with
kidnappers. The whole...

25:46.076 --> 25:50.445
It's also based on something
else, though, isn't it?

25:50.514 --> 25:52.280
Providing the girlfriend
experience requires a talent

25:52.349 --> 25:53.815
for emotional manipulation.

25:53.884 --> 25:56.051
I get close to my clients,

25:56.119 --> 25:57.819
make them trust me.

25:57.888 --> 26:01.489
Say what they want to hear,
be what they want me to be.

26:01.558 --> 26:03.792
Make them feel like
I am their best friend.

26:05.195 --> 26:07.562
I've been told you have
a similar set of skills.

26:10.300 --> 26:12.934
So, how can I trust that
your priority is Nicole?

26:15.539 --> 26:16.938
Sasha.

26:18.608 --> 26:21.676
You make a great point.

26:21.745 --> 26:23.712
But you can trust me.

26:23.780 --> 26:25.714
And if you want to get out of
this room and save Nicole,

26:25.782 --> 26:27.015
you're gonna have to.

26:29.553 --> 26:31.319
Now, here's the truth.

26:31.388 --> 26:34.856
We have to let Peterson in
on this, but we've convinced him

26:34.925 --> 26:36.191
to let us take the watch
back to Kent

26:36.259 --> 26:37.659
in exchange for Nicole.

26:37.728 --> 26:41.429
This is on our terms here, all
right; we're running the show.

26:41.498 --> 26:43.131
(whispering):
I promise.

26:47.137 --> 26:48.403
(whispers inaudibly)

26:56.513 --> 26:59.447
We've got to release him, but...

26:59.516 --> 27:01.783
follow Beaumont
wherever he goes.

27:01.852 --> 27:05.220
I want to make sure I'm not
getting screwed here.

27:05.288 --> 27:07.122
Huh.

27:07.190 --> 27:08.656
(grunts)

27:11.328 --> 27:13.395
Oh.
(chuckles)
Ooh.

27:13.463 --> 27:16.064
You get used to it
after having three kids.

27:16.133 --> 27:19.434
You never wanted any?
No.

27:19.503 --> 27:21.369
Right now, I'd have to say
I'm good with that decision.

27:21.438 --> 27:23.171
(chuckles)

27:27.477 --> 27:29.511
Aha.

27:31.948 --> 27:32.881
Let me tell you,

27:32.949 --> 27:34.949
a lot nicer than finding corn

27:35.018 --> 27:37.118
and plastic army men.
(chuckles)

27:37.187 --> 27:38.987
PETERSON:
If this works, any message

27:39.055 --> 27:41.723
Kent receives on the watch,
we'll see.

27:41.792 --> 27:44.492
(watch chimes)

27:44.561 --> 27:47.762
Mirroring worked.
We're ready.

27:47.831 --> 27:49.764
I'm done now, right?

27:49.833 --> 27:51.833
You said this was my last job.

27:51.902 --> 27:53.835
I want you to tell me
I'm finished.

27:53.904 --> 27:55.103
We'll talk about this after.

27:55.172 --> 27:56.805
No, I want something in writing.

27:56.873 --> 27:58.840
I said we'll talk after.

27:58.909 --> 28:01.109
You're lying.
You never keep your word.

28:01.178 --> 28:03.178
All right, listen, Sasha's
tested monthly for drugs

28:03.246 --> 28:04.345
at Discretion.

28:04.414 --> 28:06.080
They've never found anything
in her system.

28:06.149 --> 28:07.348
Your point?

28:07.417 --> 28:08.950
We both know
those drugs were planted

28:09.019 --> 28:10.251
by someone who wanted
to bring Kent down.

28:10.320 --> 28:12.287
And if Internal Affairs
knew about it,

28:12.355 --> 28:14.189
I'm sure they'd love
to investigate.

28:14.257 --> 28:15.990
You're blowing smoke, Beaumont.

28:16.059 --> 28:19.060
Interesting that you
didn't deny it.

28:20.730 --> 28:22.931
We're gonna get you out,
but we need maximum leverage

28:22.999 --> 28:25.300
in order to do that,
and we don't have it yet.

28:25.368 --> 28:27.836
We need to focus on Nicole.

28:30.841 --> 28:32.207
You're a prick.

28:34.611 --> 28:36.377
Sorry you feel that way.

28:36.446 --> 28:38.780
Until this is wrapped up,
you're just too valuable a tool

28:38.849 --> 28:41.883
to simply let go.

28:48.925 --> 28:51.893
CYNTHIA:
<i> 6:59. Cutting it close.</i>

28:51.962 --> 28:54.229
Well, at least
we're cutting it.

28:54.297 --> 28:55.363
I take it you have my watch?

28:55.432 --> 28:58.600
I take it you've got Nicole?

29:00.837 --> 29:02.604
(sighs)

29:13.316 --> 29:14.782
(chiming)

29:14.851 --> 29:15.850
We've got it.

29:17.621 --> 29:18.920
We all good?

29:18.989 --> 29:23.057
It's a pleasure doing business
with you, Mr. Beaumont.

29:23.126 --> 29:24.792
KENT:
She's all yours.

29:33.904 --> 29:38.306
Yeah.
Change of plans.

29:38.375 --> 29:39.874
Change of plans?

29:39.943 --> 29:43.378
My boy here tells me that the
same car passed by three times

29:43.446 --> 29:44.612
outside since you've arrived.

29:44.681 --> 29:47.649
So, you were followed.

29:47.717 --> 29:49.050
What, you think we're trying
to set you up?

29:49.119 --> 29:51.286
I don't know, you tell me.

29:51.354 --> 29:52.353
We just want Nicole back.

29:52.422 --> 29:53.688
We're not trying to do
anything else.

29:53.757 --> 29:57.659
Yeah...

29:57.727 --> 29:59.894
I'd love to believe that
you wouldn't do anything

29:59.963 --> 30:03.097
to put her life in jeopardy,
but... (chuckles)

30:03.166 --> 30:04.399
...I can't be stupid.

30:04.467 --> 30:06.367
Meaning what, exactly?

30:06.436 --> 30:11.272
Okay, if 11:00 comes and goes
without incident, she can leave.

30:11.341 --> 30:12.941
But if not--

30:15.145 --> 30:17.679
If not...

30:20.350 --> 30:22.617
...she might just have to
stick around.

30:22.686 --> 30:24.485
What'd he say.

30:24.554 --> 30:26.821
Oh, man...

30:26.890 --> 30:28.756
We need to talk to Peterson.

30:28.825 --> 30:29.924
Peterson.

30:29.993 --> 30:31.492
Just got a message from Eric.

30:31.561 --> 30:33.027
You got to hold off on the raid.

30:33.096 --> 30:34.529
What are you talking about?

30:34.598 --> 30:36.130
Kent and Han are meeting
at 9:00.

30:36.199 --> 30:38.499
Kent's holding Nicole
until after that.

30:38.568 --> 30:40.034
If you go in there,
he'll kill her.

30:40.103 --> 30:41.636
You need to hold off.

30:41.705 --> 30:44.706
I can't.
This is our shot.

30:44.774 --> 30:46.474
We can raid Kent's after
to get Nicole.

30:46.543 --> 30:49.277
That will be too late.
Nicole will be dead.

30:49.346 --> 30:50.912
I'm sorry.

30:50.981 --> 30:53.247
And I'm sorry for Nicole if
the worst ends up happening.

30:53.316 --> 30:56.284
Hopefully, we can avoid that.

30:56.353 --> 30:59.020
But the raid is happening
at 9:00.

31:07.697 --> 31:08.963
PETERSON:
<i> All right, listen up.</i>

31:09.032 --> 31:10.798
We get one shot.

31:10.867 --> 31:15.737
So, we don't move until we see
Kent, Han and the shipment.

31:15.805 --> 31:17.438
Let's take our positions.

31:17.507 --> 31:19.207
Let's roll!
Hey, eyes up, everyone.

31:19.275 --> 31:21.642
Let's go.
Moving out.

31:22.946 --> 31:24.712
SASHA:<i> What-- no,</i>
<i> if-if Petersen raids the deal,</i>

31:24.781 --> 31:26.347
Nicole is dead.

31:26.416 --> 31:28.916
OLIVER: (stammers) Sasha, I
know, I-I need you to calm down.

31:28.985 --> 31:30.251
No, the only person
who's allowed to tell me

31:30.320 --> 31:31.419
to calm down is my mother.

31:31.488 --> 31:33.121
Okay, fair enough.

31:33.189 --> 31:34.856
I'm just saying it's not over.

31:34.924 --> 31:36.524
Oliver's right, we
still have time.

31:36.593 --> 31:38.092
We need a new plan.

31:38.161 --> 31:40.228
We have to keep Nicole alive
and find a way

31:40.296 --> 31:41.496
for Peterson
to get his fentanyl.

31:41.564 --> 31:42.730
Since we can't change
Petersen's mind,

31:42.799 --> 31:44.999
we'll have
to work on Kent.

31:46.770 --> 31:48.169
You have an idea?

31:48.238 --> 31:49.837
Yeah.

31:53.443 --> 31:55.109
Sasha.
Oh, Nicole.

31:55.178 --> 31:56.277
Oh, my gosh, thank God
you're okay.

31:56.346 --> 31:57.879
I was so worried about you.

31:57.947 --> 31:59.080
He didn't hurt you,
he didn't touch you-- okay.
No.

31:59.149 --> 32:00.248
Sit.

32:00.316 --> 32:02.316
Sit.

32:04.187 --> 32:05.920
Look who we have here.

32:05.989 --> 32:07.588
Love of my life.

32:07.657 --> 32:09.924
Please Thomas,
you-you have to let Nicole go.

32:09.993 --> 32:11.993
Okay? She had nothing
to do with this...
You lied to me.

32:12.061 --> 32:14.028
Baby, I'm sorry, but there
was nothing I could do.

32:14.097 --> 32:16.430
You are still
lying to me.

32:16.499 --> 32:18.533
No, I'm not.

32:18.601 --> 32:20.701
Please, Thomas.

32:20.770 --> 32:23.204
Look, I know
how you felt about me.

32:23.273 --> 32:25.807
You have to believe

32:25.875 --> 32:28.643
I felt the same way, too,
and I-I still do,

32:28.711 --> 32:30.011
but it was either work
with the police

32:30.079 --> 32:33.181
or go to jail.
If you loved me,

32:33.249 --> 32:34.849
you would have picked jail.

32:34.918 --> 32:37.251
But then I wouldn't have
been able to help you.

32:38.588 --> 32:40.488
The cops know that your deal
is going down

32:40.557 --> 32:42.390
at 9:00
and they know where.

32:42.458 --> 32:46.961
You still have time to call Han
and change the location.

32:47.030 --> 32:48.362
Wow.

32:49.399 --> 32:51.499
Hey.

32:51.568 --> 32:54.669
I'm telling you this
because I love you,

32:54.737 --> 32:56.671
so you don't get arrested.

32:56.739 --> 32:58.973
So we can start over.

32:59.042 --> 33:03.344
Hey, you remember
when you took me to New York?

33:03.413 --> 33:06.681
Central Park.
The shows, the hotel.

33:06.749 --> 33:09.116
I mean, we can do that again.

33:09.185 --> 33:11.686
We can do that forever.

33:11.754 --> 33:15.923
Please, Thomas, I love you.

33:17.994 --> 33:20.361
Okay, you can go.

33:20.430 --> 33:22.096
Go.

33:22.165 --> 33:23.831
Sash...

33:23.900 --> 33:26.334
Hey, hey. Hey.

33:26.402 --> 33:29.370
If you love me, we're
doing this together.

33:29.439 --> 33:31.539
Yeah, of course.

33:31.608 --> 33:33.875
(laughs):
Of course.

33:37.447 --> 33:39.080
Go.

33:55.365 --> 33:58.432
PETERSON:
What the hell?

33:58.501 --> 34:00.234
Go, now!

34:00.303 --> 34:02.470
(sirens wailing,
tires screeching)

34:05.775 --> 34:08.109
Freeze!
Do not move! Right
where you are!

34:08.177 --> 34:10.077
Whoa, whoa. Easy.
What the hell are you doing?

34:10.146 --> 34:11.779
You just compromised
an official investigation.

34:11.848 --> 34:14.882
The location of the fentanyl
exchange has switched.

34:14.951 --> 34:16.617
What the hell are you talking
about? How do you...

34:16.686 --> 34:19.086
We know because we're the ones
that got Kent to switch it.

34:19.155 --> 34:22.089
Stand down.

34:34.837 --> 34:37.505
She convinced him
to switch location.

34:50.153 --> 34:52.153
Eric has eyes on Kent now.

34:52.221 --> 34:54.689
He'll track him
to the new location.

34:54.757 --> 34:56.991
Are you guys out of your mind?
I could arrest you right here.

34:57.060 --> 34:58.426
Couldn't let the raid happen
and risk

34:58.494 --> 34:59.760
losing Nicole, we told you that.

34:59.829 --> 35:01.829
And I told you this is about
more than Nicole.

35:01.898 --> 35:04.765
Believe me, Detective, we know,
all right? And we understand.

35:04.834 --> 35:10.104
But this war on Kent, on
fentanyl, it's not a war, is it?

35:10.173 --> 35:12.540
It's personal.
It's a vendetta.

35:12.608 --> 35:13.841
It's about your son.

35:13.910 --> 35:16.310
My son has nothing
to do with this.

35:16.379 --> 35:19.180
We know fentanyl
took your son, Detective.

35:20.383 --> 35:23.017
And we are truly sorry.

35:23.086 --> 35:26.854
He was just a kid.

35:26.923 --> 35:29.190
Smoked weed with his buddies
sometimes, you know?

35:29.258 --> 35:31.225
What kid his age
doesn't do that?

35:31.294 --> 35:35.162
He wasn't an addict, but the
fentanyl made my son a victim.

35:35.231 --> 35:36.564
Kent has no regard
for human life.

35:36.632 --> 35:38.332
To him, it's expendable.

35:38.401 --> 35:39.667
But you do understand

35:39.736 --> 35:41.535
you're treating Sasha and Nicole
the same way, right?

35:41.604 --> 35:43.504
You planted coke
on Sasha.

35:43.573 --> 35:45.172
You called her a tool.

35:45.241 --> 35:47.375
But you made her a tool.
You're treating them

35:47.443 --> 35:49.543
like their lives are expendable,
but they're not.

35:49.612 --> 35:51.979
Just like
your son's wasn't.

35:52.048 --> 35:54.548
You're letting Kent
get away with this.

35:54.617 --> 35:57.051
We can get you
the new location, Detective.

35:57.120 --> 35:59.120
If you let Sasha go.

35:59.188 --> 36:01.088
No more C.I. work.

36:27.316 --> 36:28.649
(clears throat)

36:36.259 --> 36:38.793
Son of a bitch.

36:40.430 --> 36:42.229
What did you do?

36:42.298 --> 36:44.098
Nothing. I didn't...

36:44.167 --> 36:46.133
Everybody take it easy.
Kent, hold on.

36:46.202 --> 36:48.369
Hold...
Shut up!

36:48.438 --> 36:50.971
Did you betray me again?

36:51.040 --> 36:54.041
It's called
the girlfriend experience.

36:54.110 --> 36:55.376
Did you forget that?

36:55.445 --> 36:56.844
It's not real.

36:58.648 --> 37:00.114
ERIC:
Kent, Kent, Kent,
you're right.

37:00.183 --> 37:01.615
Sasha did betray you.

37:01.684 --> 37:03.584
I swear to God,
I'll put a bullet in her.

37:03.653 --> 37:04.952
Is that really what's important
to you right now?

37:05.021 --> 37:07.321
Now, if I'm correct,
there is a massive shipment

37:07.390 --> 37:09.890
of fentanyl arriving via
Jong Han's men in five minutes.

37:09.959 --> 37:12.460
The cops and DEA

37:12.528 --> 37:13.928
are gonna be here
in eight minutes.

37:13.996 --> 37:16.464
So, as far as I'm concerned,
you have two options.

37:16.532 --> 37:17.631
You call them off,

37:17.700 --> 37:18.766
or I kill her.

37:18.835 --> 37:20.334
I think you should
listen to the options.

37:20.403 --> 37:22.670
Option A, you kill everyone.

37:22.738 --> 37:24.438
Me, Cynthia, Sasha,

37:24.507 --> 37:27.074
in time to get the fentanyl,
then engage in a shootout

37:27.143 --> 37:28.375
with law enforcement, a shootout

37:28.444 --> 37:30.311
you cannot win.

37:32.782 --> 37:33.948
(sniffs)

37:34.016 --> 37:35.850
(grunts)
No, no, no.
(gunshot)

37:35.918 --> 37:37.184
(screams)
Hey.

37:39.689 --> 37:41.856
Option B,

37:41.924 --> 37:43.991
you kill none of us.

37:44.060 --> 37:46.460
You get in the car
and drive off scot-free

37:46.529 --> 37:48.863
with a five-minute
head start on the police.

37:57.406 --> 38:00.674
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

38:00.743 --> 38:02.143
(car doors closing)

38:02.211 --> 38:04.712
(engine starts)

38:04.780 --> 38:06.680
Sash.
(panting): Nicole.

38:06.749 --> 38:08.449
(tires screeching)

38:08.518 --> 38:09.550
You're okay.

38:09.619 --> 38:11.218
SASHA:
Oh, you, too.

38:11.287 --> 38:13.354
It's Han's men.
Everybody in the car.

38:13.422 --> 38:14.688
Come on, come on.

38:14.757 --> 38:17.024
(doors close, engine starts)

38:29.405 --> 38:30.671
(sirens wailing)

38:32.141 --> 38:34.008
(tires screeching)

38:35.912 --> 38:37.678
Let's go. Come on.
Go, go, go!

38:37.747 --> 38:39.580
Move! Everybody, move!

38:39.649 --> 38:42.550
Everybody, eyes up.
Open it.

38:42.618 --> 38:43.551
You! Freeze.

38:43.619 --> 38:44.818
You, stand... just stand there.

38:44.887 --> 38:46.854
Stand there!
(indistinct shouting)

38:47.924 --> 38:49.456
OFFICER:
Here we go.

38:53.262 --> 38:54.728
Now, we're looking
for Thomas Kent.

38:54.797 --> 38:56.530
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

38:56.599 --> 38:57.865
You heard him.
Let's move out.

38:57.934 --> 38:59.934
Okay, let's go.
Come on.

39:05.107 --> 39:07.141
You're done.

39:08.177 --> 39:10.077
You're letting me go?

39:10.146 --> 39:12.746
OFFICER:
Move it out, move it out.

39:15.985 --> 39:17.985
(both laugh)

39:22.992 --> 39:24.225
NICOLE:
<i> Did you miss Mommy?</i>

39:24.293 --> 39:25.392
SASHA:
<i> Sasha missed your mommy, too.</i>

39:25.461 --> 39:27.361
ERIC:
Feels good.

39:27.430 --> 39:28.862
Kid getting his mom back.

39:28.931 --> 39:30.197
Definitely.
Yeah.

39:30.266 --> 39:31.632
CYNTHIA: And Sasha not
working for the police

39:31.701 --> 39:32.800
really opens
up her life,

39:32.868 --> 39:34.969
so she can make her
own decisions again.

39:35.037 --> 39:36.971
(exhales)

39:37.039 --> 39:39.640
So, what now?

39:39.709 --> 39:42.376
You know, now that you don't
have to live a double life.

39:42.445 --> 39:43.911
(laughs softly)
Who knows?

39:43.980 --> 39:46.313
Maybe go back to Discretion?

39:46.349 --> 39:48.616
Maybe try to use that degree
I worked and paid for?

39:48.684 --> 39:50.551
Yeah?

39:50.620 --> 39:53.721
Yeah. Though I'd probably have
to leave Seattle to do it.

39:53.789 --> 39:55.089
So then we leave.

39:55.157 --> 39:57.091
Zak and I could use
a change of scenery.

39:57.159 --> 39:58.259
Really?

39:58.327 --> 39:59.760
OLIVER: Okay, we're
gonna take off.

39:59.829 --> 40:02.229
Um, you guys good?

40:02.298 --> 40:04.632
Yeah, yeah. We're great.

40:04.700 --> 40:05.866
Thank you.

40:05.935 --> 40:07.501
Yeah.

40:09.038 --> 40:10.471
Thank you.

40:10.539 --> 40:11.839
Bye.
Thank you.

40:11.907 --> 40:13.040
ERIC:
Take care, guys.

40:13.109 --> 40:14.975
Hey, buddy.

40:20.549 --> 40:23.851
Yates.

40:23.919 --> 40:25.653
What's going on?
Huh?

40:25.721 --> 40:27.921
Case is over. Brain
no longer needed.

40:27.990 --> 40:32.559
Yeah, sorry, I just, um,
zoned out for a second.

40:32.628 --> 40:35.129
I have a question for you.

40:35.197 --> 40:37.264
Shoot.

40:37.333 --> 40:40.100
Well, you know that feeling you
said you had sometimes, like,

40:40.169 --> 40:43.537
we're sitting ducks and how you
want to protect yourself and us?

40:44.907 --> 40:47.308
Was that about Maxine?

40:47.376 --> 40:49.510
What are you talking about?

40:49.578 --> 40:51.145
Oliver.

40:51.213 --> 40:53.213
The woman you loved
was forced to kill a man

40:53.282 --> 40:54.348
in order to save you.

40:54.417 --> 40:55.883
If anything can conjure up

40:55.951 --> 40:57.518
feelings of helplessness...
Have you
been reading

40:57.586 --> 41:01.255
<i> Psychology Today</i>
in your spare time? Hmm?

41:01.324 --> 41:04.158
Okay, fine.

41:05.194 --> 41:07.127
I was just looking out.

41:07.196 --> 41:09.063
I appreciate it.

41:11.233 --> 41:12.933
I'm fine.
