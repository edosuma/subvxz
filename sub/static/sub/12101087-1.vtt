01:04.057 --> 01:06.926
In the
beginning, God said,

01:06.960 --> 01:11.265
"Let us make man in our image,
according to our likeness".

01:11.298 --> 01:13.800
And the Lord God formed the man

01:13.833 --> 01:15.369
from the dust of the ground,

01:15.402 --> 01:19.273
and breathed into his
nostrils the breath of life,

01:19.306 --> 01:21.908
and man became a living being.

01:22.476 --> 01:24.278
But the Lord said,

01:24.311 --> 01:27.314
"It is not good that
man should be alone".

01:27.348 --> 01:31.152
"I will make him a helper
comparable to him."

01:31.185 --> 01:34.455
Then the rib, which the Lord
God had taken from the man,

01:34.488 --> 01:36.223
he made into a woman,

01:36.257 --> 01:38.292
and brought her to the man.

01:38.325 --> 01:40.960
Adam said, "This
is now bone of my bones,

01:40.994 --> 01:42.996
and flesh of my flesh".

01:43.029 --> 01:44.198
"She shall be called woman

01:44.231 --> 01:46.367
because she was
taken out of man."

01:46.400 --> 01:48.935
"Therefore, a man shall
leave his father and mother,

01:48.968 --> 01:51.438
and be joined to his wife,

01:51.472 --> 01:54.441
and they shall
become one flesh."

02:04.518 --> 02:05.852
Hello?

02:07.454 --> 02:08.955
Yes, this is she.

02:10.924 --> 02:11.925
Oh my god!

02:13.893 --> 02:14.994
What happened?

02:16.263 --> 02:17.198
Yes.

02:17.231 --> 02:18.165
What happened?

02:18.199 --> 02:19.500
What hospital?

02:25.506 --> 02:26.340
Hey, baby.

02:26.373 --> 02:27.241
- What's up?
- I...

02:29.410 --> 02:30.244
What's goin' on?

02:30.277 --> 02:31.178
What happened?

02:31.212 --> 02:32.279
It's my dad, he's sick.

02:32.313 --> 02:33.347
What do
you mean he's sick?

02:33.380 --> 02:34.281
I mean, he's sick, baby.

02:34.315 --> 02:35.416
He's in the hospital right now.

02:35.449 --> 02:36.250
What happened to him?

02:36.283 --> 02:37.050
I don't know,

02:37.084 --> 02:38.385
that's why we need
to go and find out.

02:38.419 --> 02:39.953
Oh, no.

02:39.986 --> 02:41.155
I'm sorry, baby.

02:47.060 --> 02:48.529
We need to go to the hospital.

02:48.562 --> 02:50.029
I can't.

02:50.063 --> 02:51.465
I can't go to the
hospital right now.

02:51.498 --> 02:52.932
This motion is due
by seven tomorrow.

02:52.966 --> 02:55.135
I need to go to the hospital.

02:55.169 --> 02:59.273
Yes, baby, I'll take
you, but I just can't stay.

02:59.306 --> 03:01.074
Can you stay an hour?

03:01.108 --> 03:02.176
Okay, just one hour?

03:02.209 --> 03:03.510
I don't think I...

03:03.544 --> 03:06.413
- I can't do this by myself.
- No, I can't.

03:06.447 --> 03:08.515
Please, don't do this.

03:08.549 --> 03:10.284
Do what?

03:10.317 --> 03:12.086
You're always try to guilt
trip me into doing things,

03:12.119 --> 03:16.156
and when I don't, you make
me feel like a freakin' jerk.

03:16.190 --> 03:17.924
Fine, don't go.

03:17.957 --> 03:18.925
I'll see you later.

03:18.958 --> 03:20.160
This is what

03:20.194 --> 03:21.328
- I'm talking about.
- Enough, Brandon.

03:21.362 --> 03:22.229
I don't have time
for this, okay?

03:22.263 --> 03:25.532
I will go to the
hospital by myself, okay?

03:25.566 --> 03:27.568
Look, I'm sorry
about your dad.

03:27.601 --> 03:29.270
Let me know how he's doing,

03:29.303 --> 03:30.337
okay?

03:30.371 --> 03:33.973
Whatever.

03:38.044 --> 03:39.546
Hey, sweet pea!

03:39.580 --> 03:40.581
What's goin' on?

03:40.614 --> 03:41.448
What happened to you?

03:41.482 --> 03:43.417
Out of no where,

03:43.450 --> 03:47.454
my stomach started hurting
me something terrible,

03:47.488 --> 03:50.324
so go inside, use the bathroom,

03:53.093 --> 03:56.130
and there's blood in the toilet.

03:56.163 --> 03:57.431
What really made it worse,

03:57.464 --> 04:00.401
was I took some
pills for the pain,

04:02.236 --> 04:06.507
and after a couple of hours,
pain came back so strong

04:08.007 --> 04:11.278
I could barely hold myself up.

04:11.312 --> 04:12.479
After a while,

04:12.513 --> 04:15.282
your brother came and found me,

04:15.316 --> 04:17.618
and took me here to
get me checked out.

04:17.651 --> 04:18.519
Oh god.

04:19.052 --> 04:20.487
Has the doctor seen you yet?

04:20.521 --> 04:21.622
Yep.

04:21.655 --> 04:23.424
Yeah.

04:23.457 --> 04:26.059
Yeah, yeah, he saw
me, ran some tests,

04:26.093 --> 04:30.230
and we'll see what it looks
like later on tonight.

04:32.232 --> 04:34.368
Daddy, I'm gonna come and
stay with you for a few weeks.

04:34.401 --> 04:35.502
Mm-mm, no.

04:35.536 --> 04:36.403
- Honey, no.
- Daddy, no.

04:36.437 --> 04:38.272
- No, no, no.
- It is not up for discussion.

04:38.305 --> 04:39.306
I said no.

04:40.407 --> 04:42.476
You have your own
life, your own family

04:42.509 --> 04:44.078
- to take care of.
- Daddy,

04:44.111 --> 04:46.246
Brandon will understand.

04:46.280 --> 04:47.281
You need me right now.

04:47.314 --> 04:50.384
No, I need you to be at
home with your husband.

04:50.417 --> 04:52.286
You all need each other.

04:52.319 --> 04:54.355
I'm gonna be all right.

04:54.388 --> 04:57.358
Besides, I still have your
idiot brother with me.

05:02.596 --> 05:05.132
I love you so much sweetie.

05:07.434 --> 05:10.036
And I'm proud of you.

05:10.069 --> 05:13.240
Your mama would be proud too.

05:13.273 --> 05:14.141
I know.

05:14.675 --> 05:16.176
I love you too.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.148
I gotta go to the bathroom.

05:21.181 --> 05:22.449
Here, here,
let me help you up.

05:22.483 --> 05:23.584
No,
no, no, no, no.

05:27.187 --> 05:27.887
Are you all right?

05:27.920 --> 05:29.289
- I'm fine, I'm fine-
- Mr. Taylor,

05:29.323 --> 05:30.424
are you all right?

05:30.457 --> 05:31.558
I'm
fine, I'm fine.

05:31.592 --> 05:32.626
Just let me get
ahold of my breath.

05:32.659 --> 05:33.527
- To my knees.
- What happened?

05:33.560 --> 05:34.294
Ow.

05:34.328 --> 05:35.696
Come on, I got you.

05:35.729 --> 05:37.498
Take your time.

05:37.531 --> 05:38.665
I gotta go to the bathroom.

05:38.699 --> 05:40.501
- All right.
- Daddy, your socks are

05:40.534 --> 05:41.635
on the wrong way.

05:41.668 --> 05:42.703
Let's sit you down first,

05:42.736 --> 05:43.670
all right?

05:43.704 --> 05:45.172
Let's go over some results.

05:45.205 --> 05:46.373
I gotta see a
man about a horse.

05:46.407 --> 05:47.274
Don't worry,

05:47.307 --> 05:48.175
I'm gonna take you to
see that man, all right?

05:48.208 --> 05:52.112
Just listen to me for
one second, all right?

05:53.414 --> 05:54.415
You his daughter?

05:54.448 --> 05:56.183
Yes, yes.

05:56.216 --> 05:58.685
Good, glad
to have some support here.

05:58.719 --> 05:59.720
Are you all right?

05:59.753 --> 06:01.588
Yes, yes, I'm fine.

06:01.622 --> 06:04.191
What do the test results show?

06:04.224 --> 06:07.161
Have a seat for
a moment, please.

06:08.695 --> 06:09.929
Please.

07:47.494 --> 07:49.830
I didn't hear you come in.

07:49.863 --> 07:50.797
How is he?

07:51.865 --> 07:53.433
Do you care?

07:53.467 --> 07:56.336
I wouldn't ask
if I didn't care.

07:57.471 --> 07:58.839
He's sick.

07:58.872 --> 08:03.042
They say he needs surgery
three weeks from now.

08:03.777 --> 08:05.779
Man, sorry about that.

08:07.681 --> 08:08.849
What happened to you?

08:08.882 --> 08:10.450
I tried to lift
daddy out of the bed,

08:10.484 --> 08:13.787
and he pulled my arm
trying not to fall.

08:14.688 --> 08:15.789
It's not a big deal.

08:15.822 --> 08:17.624
I'm fine.

08:17.658 --> 08:18.458
Hmm.

08:18.492 --> 08:20.427
Well what did he say
was wrong with him?

08:20.460 --> 08:22.529
They say that daddy has-

08:22.563 --> 08:23.397
It's Matthew.

08:23.430 --> 08:24.331
I gotta take this.

08:24.364 --> 08:25.532
Babe, just give me a second,

08:25.566 --> 08:27.267
and I'll help you rub
your shoulder, okay?

08:27.301 --> 08:30.804
Matt, did you get
the draft I sent you?

08:32.406 --> 08:34.374
Good.

08:34.408 --> 08:35.776
Excellent.

08:35.809 --> 08:38.445
I need you to look at
the bottom of page three.

08:38.478 --> 08:39.413
Yeah. Yeah.

08:41.348 --> 08:42.749
You see it?

08:50.924 --> 08:53.827
Jamison, Wilson, Stewart.

08:53.860 --> 08:55.262
Yes, of course.

08:56.797 --> 08:58.865
No, she's in litigation.

09:01.902 --> 09:04.638
Maybe I can put you
through to her secretary?

09:04.671 --> 09:05.539
Mm-hmm.

09:07.541 --> 09:08.742
Hold, please.

09:08.775 --> 09:09.509
Jackson Black.

09:09.543 --> 09:11.511
I'm here to meet
with Ruth Stewart.

09:11.545 --> 09:12.679
Of course.

09:12.713 --> 09:13.914
If you have a seat,
please, Mr. Black,

09:13.947 --> 09:15.182
I'll make sure that
she know you're here.

09:15.215 --> 09:17.684
All
right, thank you.

09:19.920 --> 09:22.623
Ms. Stewart, Mr. Black
is here to see you.

09:22.656 --> 09:23.590
Yes.

09:23.624 --> 09:24.591
Mm-hmm.

09:24.625 --> 09:25.859
Okay.

09:29.863 --> 09:31.298
Jackson?

09:31.331 --> 09:32.666
Yes.

09:38.805 --> 09:40.340
Jackson Black.

09:40.374 --> 09:41.408
A pleasure to meet you.

09:41.441 --> 09:42.342
Ruth Stewart.

09:42.376 --> 09:43.543
Very nice to meet you as well.

09:43.577 --> 09:45.545
I am very excited to
be here, Ms. Stewart.

09:45.579 --> 09:47.614
Oh, please, skip
the formalities.

09:47.648 --> 09:48.682
Call me Ruth.

09:48.715 --> 09:49.549
We're the same age.

09:50.450 --> 09:51.618
Okay, no problem.

09:51.652 --> 09:52.786
I just wanted to come
correct, that's all.

09:52.819 --> 09:54.454
From what I can
see from your resume,

09:54.488 --> 09:55.555
you are quite impressive.

09:55.589 --> 09:58.625
Weinstein & Shapiro recommended
you with much enthusiasm.

09:58.659 --> 09:59.726
Thank you.

09:59.760 --> 10:01.662
We're always happy to have
another associate on board.

10:01.695 --> 10:03.797
And I'm gonna be your mentor
for the next three months,

10:03.830 --> 10:05.932
so we'll be working
pretty closely together.

10:05.966 --> 10:09.703
I can tell I'm gonna
be in really good hands.

10:09.736 --> 10:10.871
Indeed.

10:10.904 --> 10:12.973
Come, let me show you
around the office.

10:47.874 --> 10:48.675
Daddy?

10:48.709 --> 10:50.577
Daddy, what do you
mean they don't have

10:50.610 --> 10:52.012
your insurance information?

10:52.045 --> 10:55.916
It's on your paperwork from
Dr. Concordia's office.

10:58.051 --> 11:00.854
But that's not your
fault, that's their fault!

11:00.887 --> 11:02.422
I can't believe they're
trying to bombard you

11:02.456 --> 11:05.792
with all this
nonsense right now?

11:05.826 --> 11:06.727
Yes, I'm...

11:07.928 --> 11:10.397
I'm not, I'm not,
I'm really not.

11:15.936 --> 11:18.505
You know what,
daddy, I actually...

11:18.538 --> 11:21.675
I keep a file with your
paperwork at my desk at the job,

11:21.708 --> 11:23.744
so I'm gonna take
a look at that,

11:23.777 --> 11:26.880
and I'm gonna send it over
to the hospital, okay?

11:26.913 --> 11:28.782
Yeah, no, no, no, no, I'm
not, I'm not, I'm not.

11:28.815 --> 11:30.517
Everything's okay.

11:30.550 --> 11:31.885
It's fine.

11:31.918 --> 11:33.019
Okay, I will.

11:34.088 --> 11:35.622
I love you too.

11:36.623 --> 11:37.791
Bye.

12:09.589 --> 12:10.791
- Brandon?
- Yeah?

12:16.530 --> 12:21.067
Can you come here, please.

12:26.907 --> 12:28.608
Yeah, what is it?

12:29.709 --> 12:30.777
Three days?

12:33.147 --> 12:34.014
Three.

12:35.816 --> 12:37.050
Are you serious?

12:37.084 --> 12:38.852
What do you
mean, am I serious?

12:38.885 --> 12:39.986
Are you serious?

12:40.020 --> 12:42.722
Did you seriously leave
nasty dirty dishes

12:42.756 --> 12:44.591
in the sink for three days?

12:44.624 --> 12:47.861
Look, I don't have time
for this right now, okay?

12:47.894 --> 12:51.031
I've told you a hundred
times, we need a housekeeper.

12:51.064 --> 12:52.499
I know you like to
keep things clean,

12:52.532 --> 12:55.068
and you know I have
a lot of work to do.

12:55.102 --> 12:57.704
I told you before, I
don't want a housekeeper.

12:57.737 --> 12:59.072
They steal from people,

12:59.106 --> 13:01.608
and besides, we can
clean up after ourselves,

13:01.641 --> 13:03.110
but it just takes
a mutual effort.

13:03.144 --> 13:04.678
You already know
I work very hard.

13:04.711 --> 13:05.979
To hell with that!

13:06.012 --> 13:07.081
I work hard too.

13:07.114 --> 13:08.782
I support us too.

13:08.815 --> 13:11.985
I work late, I write motions,
appeals, I go to court.

13:12.018 --> 13:14.088
We're both attorneys,
so don't give me that.

13:14.121 --> 13:15.555
All right, calm down.

13:15.589 --> 13:16.756
Now, look, all I'm saying is,

13:16.790 --> 13:18.925
is that instead of complaining,

13:18.959 --> 13:22.096
that you should try
and hire a housekeeper,

13:22.129 --> 13:23.964
or wash them yourself.

13:25.732 --> 13:27.901
'Cause I always wash
them myself, Brandon.

13:27.934 --> 13:29.035
Always.

13:29.069 --> 13:31.738
And I don't complain,
I just do it.

13:31.771 --> 13:33.740
You seem to not be complaining

13:33.773 --> 13:35.709
- a lot lately.
- Mmm.

13:35.742 --> 13:38.545
I'm not the only one who
eats off of these plates,

13:38.578 --> 13:39.980
or walks on these floors,

13:40.013 --> 13:42.916
or uses the bathroom,
or wears clothes.

13:42.949 --> 13:47.954
Look, look, all I'm saying,
is that when I cook for us,

13:48.356 --> 13:50.557
which is all the time,

13:50.590 --> 13:52.126
so you just wash the
dishes after we eat.

13:52.159 --> 13:53.793
It's not that deep.

13:53.827 --> 13:56.997
Fine, I will wash them
after I finish my work, okay?

13:57.030 --> 13:59.900
I'm meeting with Freddie
and Matt tomorrow night,

13:59.933 --> 14:00.834
and I don't know how long

14:00.867 --> 14:04.205
- Freddie and Matt?
- I'm gonna be out for, so-

14:04.238 --> 14:05.106
Yeah.

14:05.906 --> 14:08.109
I thought you told
Deacon Mitch that you were

14:08.142 --> 14:10.577
coaching the little
league game tomorrow?

14:10.610 --> 14:11.645
That was just yesterday.

14:11.678 --> 14:12.646
Well, something came up.

14:12.679 --> 14:14.047
I'm sure he'll understand.

14:14.081 --> 14:16.983
So you just flat out
lied to him, and me?

14:18.018 --> 14:19.186
It's not lying, Ruth.

14:19.220 --> 14:20.954
Things do come up.

14:21.888 --> 14:23.090
This didn't just come up.

14:23.124 --> 14:24.591
You knew this.

14:32.799 --> 14:34.034
What are you doing?

14:39.839 --> 14:40.874
Leave them.

14:40.907 --> 14:43.777
- I said, I'd wash them.
- Forget it.

14:43.810 --> 14:45.946
No, no, no, I said I got it.

14:45.979 --> 14:48.982
Baby, just forget
about it, really.

14:50.917 --> 14:53.254
Why the hell are
you always doing this?

14:53.287 --> 14:55.256
You're always telling
me what I'm doing wrong,

14:55.289 --> 14:56.257
everything I'm doing wrong,

14:56.290 --> 14:59.826
but when I try to fix it,
you don't want me too.

14:59.859 --> 15:00.994
Why even tell me
in the first place?

15:01.027 --> 15:02.729
Okay, forget I
mentioned it, okay?

15:02.762 --> 15:03.630
I am sorry.

15:03.663 --> 15:05.065
I'll do it myself, okay?

15:05.099 --> 15:06.100
Just forget it.

15:06.133 --> 15:07.168
No Ruth.

15:08.135 --> 15:09.136
I'll wash it.

15:09.170 --> 15:10.003
I got it, I got it.

15:10.036 --> 15:11.238
No!

15:11.272 --> 15:13.039
- Put it down!
- No!

15:14.208 --> 15:16.876
Ruth, I said put it down.

15:18.912 --> 15:20.847
There, I put it down.

15:29.789 --> 15:33.260
I'm sorry, okay?

15:33.294 --> 15:34.128
No.

15:35.895 --> 15:36.830
Leave it.

15:36.863 --> 15:39.065
Look, I'll take care of it.

15:40.201 --> 15:41.835
Leave it.

16:21.941 --> 16:24.078
Look, the Justice
ruled in our favor.

16:24.111 --> 16:25.112
We did a good job today,

16:25.146 --> 16:26.147
Team Ruth.

16:26.180 --> 16:27.047
Fantastic.

16:28.282 --> 16:29.116
Let's go.

16:31.285 --> 16:32.286
All right.

16:32.319 --> 16:34.020
Thank God, 'cause I am hungry.

16:34.054 --> 16:35.322
I could eat.

16:35.356 --> 16:36.956
You always could eat.

16:36.990 --> 16:40.227
Hey, there's this new
restaurant I heard about

16:40.261 --> 16:41.362
It'll be great.

16:41.395 --> 16:43.029
Let's go.

16:43.063 --> 16:44.265
Why don't we all go?

16:44.298 --> 16:45.799
So y'all don't wanna eat?

16:45.832 --> 16:47.201
But I made some beef
stew for everybody.

16:47.234 --> 16:48.335
Okay, her cooking is great.

16:48.369 --> 16:49.836
I'm with her.

16:49.869 --> 16:50.970
I don't eat beef.

16:51.004 --> 16:51.971
You don't eat beef.

16:52.005 --> 16:52.839
I eat beef.

16:52.872 --> 16:53.973
You eat beef?

16:54.007 --> 16:55.041
- Oh yeah, let's go.
- Let's go.

16:56.943 --> 16:59.012
Are you serious?

16:59.045 --> 17:00.147
That's messed up, y'all.

17:00.181 --> 17:01.215
You can come.

17:01.248 --> 17:02.615
You enjoy that beef.

17:03.284 --> 17:03.983
- Well, I don't know
- Hey.

17:04.017 --> 17:05.985
- what I'm gonna do now.
- Hey, now.

17:06.019 --> 17:06.920
Don't worry about it.

17:06.953 --> 17:07.887
It's vegan.

17:08.422 --> 17:10.291
- Vegan, really?
- Yep.

17:11.358 --> 17:13.026
Sound good?

17:13.059 --> 17:15.762
I know you like vegan.

17:15.795 --> 17:16.863
Well, let me get my coat.

17:16.896 --> 17:18.064
You're not gonna need it.

17:18.099 --> 17:19.366
It's nice outside.

17:19.400 --> 17:20.934
- Come on.
- Okay.

17:20.967 --> 17:22.136
The walk will do us some good.

17:23.104 --> 17:24.070
That's right.

17:24.105 --> 17:25.872
- After you.
- Thank you.

20:43.437 --> 20:44.271
Hi, Ruth.

20:44.305 --> 20:45.439
Oh, hey, Jackson.

20:45.472 --> 20:46.307
You scared me.

20:46.340 --> 20:47.308
I'm sorry.

20:47.341 --> 20:48.409
Never my intention.

20:48.442 --> 20:49.443
Yes, I know.

20:49.476 --> 20:50.611
Something you need?

20:50.644 --> 20:52.146
No, not really.

20:52.179 --> 20:53.380
I just wanted to get
you the statements

20:53.414 --> 20:54.581
from the Walker file.

20:54.615 --> 20:56.283
I mean, I think
this is all of them.

20:56.317 --> 20:58.552
That man is the
bane of my existence.

20:58.585 --> 21:00.087
I can't believe he
actually wants to go over

21:00.120 --> 21:04.258
every bank statement
he's had since 1975.

21:04.291 --> 21:06.393
How 'bout you don't steal
other people's money?

21:06.427 --> 21:07.461
- Check and balance that.
- Well-

21:07.494 --> 21:10.097
- That is why you
make the big bucks.

21:10.130 --> 21:11.598
Where do you want
me to put this?

21:11.632 --> 21:13.100
That's okay, I'll take them.

21:13.133 --> 21:14.234
- Thank you.
- Okay.

21:14.268 --> 21:16.103
Ow!

21:16.136 --> 21:17.036
Geez!

21:17.070 --> 21:19.106
Are you okay?

21:19.139 --> 21:20.073
Yeah.

21:20.107 --> 21:21.642
I...

21:21.675 --> 21:24.178
I hurt my shoulder
a few weeks ago.

21:24.211 --> 21:26.012
Weeks?

21:26.045 --> 21:27.181
What happened?

21:29.249 --> 21:30.484
Sorry, I don't mean to pry.

21:30.517 --> 21:31.518
- Just concerned.
- It's fine.

21:31.552 --> 21:32.486
It's okay.

21:32.519 --> 21:34.621
My father is very sick.

21:37.324 --> 21:38.858
Oh, no.

21:40.327 --> 21:44.264
At the hospital, I lifted
him up trying to help him

21:44.298 --> 21:47.234
to use the restroom, and he
slipped, and he pulled my arm.

21:48.569 --> 21:50.671
Have you seen a doctor?

21:50.704 --> 21:52.573
No, no, it's fine.

21:52.606 --> 21:53.674
Really, it's just a little sore.

21:53.707 --> 21:56.276
I mean, if you say so.

21:56.310 --> 21:58.878
My mother died six years ago.

21:59.613 --> 22:01.548
Ovarian cancer.

22:01.582 --> 22:02.549
Really?

22:02.583 --> 22:04.184
Yeah.

22:04.218 --> 22:08.522
I'm an only child, and she
raised me, so it was hard.

22:10.457 --> 22:12.159
It's gonna be all right.

22:12.192 --> 22:13.527
I promise.

22:16.330 --> 22:17.197
Yeah.

22:18.632 --> 22:20.334
Thanks, Jack.

22:20.367 --> 22:24.070
I lost my mom too while
I was an undergrad.

22:24.638 --> 22:26.140
I'm sorry, I just...

22:26.173 --> 22:27.341
- I really need to-
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

22:27.374 --> 22:29.476
To find this paperwork.

22:30.611 --> 22:32.479
You know, you're
lucky, you know?

22:32.513 --> 22:34.615
I mean, with all this going on,

22:34.648 --> 22:37.251
that you have your husband
to go through it with you.

22:37.284 --> 22:41.188
You know, standing by
your side, helping you.

22:41.221 --> 22:43.657
I mean, at least you don't
have to do it on your own.

22:43.690 --> 22:46.160
Yeah, you're right.

22:48.362 --> 22:52.533
So he's gonna meet you
here, or at the hospital?

22:52.566 --> 22:54.334
Who?

22:54.368 --> 22:56.336
Your husband.

22:56.370 --> 22:58.505
No, Brandon has to work.

23:00.374 --> 23:01.675
Oh my God, I have to text him

23:01.708 --> 23:04.178
to get his plate
out of the fridge.

23:05.345 --> 23:06.647
I'm sorry, I really just...

23:06.680 --> 23:07.714
I gotta go,

23:07.748 --> 23:09.483
- Yeah.
- and find this paperwork.

23:12.386 --> 23:13.654
Ah!

23:13.687 --> 23:14.688
Oh my god!

23:17.424 --> 23:18.592
Thank God.

23:21.328 --> 23:24.731
So, while you're
tending to everyone else,

23:26.667 --> 23:28.435
who's tending to you?

23:29.803 --> 23:34.575
What do you mean by that?

23:35.375 --> 23:37.678
Ruth, I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to be out of place.

23:37.711 --> 23:40.147
You are out of place.

23:40.948 --> 23:45.419
And just so you know, my
husband takes care of me.

23:47.721 --> 23:52.659
Jackson, don't you have somewhere to
be, or something to do?

23:52.693 --> 23:53.694
Take care.

24:00.601 --> 24:03.270
Oh God.

24:03.303 --> 24:05.539
Oh, no.

24:05.572 --> 24:07.274
- Oh my God.
- Sorry.

24:08.308 --> 24:09.376
Are you okay?

24:09.409 --> 24:12.679
Yeah, your hands are freezing.

24:12.713 --> 24:14.648
I keep screwin'
up trying to help.

24:14.681 --> 24:17.551
You know it's funny,

24:17.584 --> 24:19.720
'cause before I
went to law school,

24:19.753 --> 24:22.222
I wanted to be a chiropractor.

24:22.256 --> 24:23.757
- Oh, really?
- Yep.

24:24.858 --> 24:26.293
What happened?

24:27.561 --> 24:28.629
Long story.

24:29.630 --> 24:32.332
Short of it, I suck at biology.

24:33.400 --> 24:35.836
Oh! Ow!

24:35.869 --> 24:38.539
But a chiropractor,
my dear Ruth,

24:38.572 --> 24:40.841
is exactly who you need to see.

24:40.874 --> 24:44.745
You need to get to a
doctor, immediately.

24:44.778 --> 24:46.213
No, it's fine.

24:48.382 --> 24:50.617
It's fine, please.

24:50.651 --> 24:52.452
You say that a lot.

24:56.523 --> 25:00.227
It's 'cause
it's not fine Jackson,

25:01.762 --> 25:03.497
but I want it to be.

25:04.898 --> 25:06.333
I want it to be.

25:09.903 --> 25:12.639
Everything is gonna be fine.

25:13.740 --> 25:16.376
It'll all be all right.

25:16.410 --> 25:18.779
Trust me, okay?

25:18.812 --> 25:20.280
It feels good?

25:21.381 --> 25:22.249
Uh-huh.

25:23.517 --> 25:24.785
Yeah, thank you.

26:05.425 --> 26:08.562
Ruth.

26:09.696 --> 26:10.631
Ruth.

26:10.664 --> 26:12.399
- No.
- Come on.

26:12.432 --> 26:13.533
Oh my God.

26:13.567 --> 26:14.668
- Hey!
- Get out!

26:14.701 --> 26:15.936
Listen.

26:15.969 --> 26:17.571
No, no.

26:17.604 --> 26:18.805
No!

26:18.839 --> 26:19.873
Wait!

27:00.547 --> 27:02.749
Well, hello, Mrs. Stewart.

27:02.783 --> 27:04.384
You're home early.

27:06.553 --> 27:07.821
Hey, baby.

27:07.854 --> 27:09.423
How was your day?

27:09.456 --> 27:10.924
I'm glad you asked.

27:10.957 --> 27:13.393
The judge accepted our motion.

27:13.427 --> 27:15.595
Our client is going
to a halfway house,

27:15.629 --> 27:16.730
and won't see any jail time.

27:16.763 --> 27:21.902
And now Rosenberg, Sloan, &
Stewart LLP are $250,000 richer.

27:24.905 --> 27:27.941
So all that good and
hard work paid off.

27:27.974 --> 27:28.842
Thought we'd celebrate

27:28.875 --> 27:29.976
a little bit.

27:38.885 --> 27:40.654
And how was your day?

27:41.955 --> 27:43.790
Good, good, good.

27:47.661 --> 27:49.930
Anything excitin' happen?

27:55.969 --> 27:58.472
Well?

27:58.505 --> 27:59.940
You hungry?

27:59.973 --> 28:01.842
Dinner's almost ready.

28:01.875 --> 28:04.911
Oh, what you
cookin' over there?

28:07.581 --> 28:09.549
Tomato and okra chili,

28:09.583 --> 28:12.652
brown rice, vegetables,
and cornbread.

28:13.687 --> 28:14.955
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

28:16.490 --> 28:19.960
It smells so good too.

28:19.993 --> 28:22.662
You've always known
the way to my heart.

28:22.696 --> 28:26.566
Are you on the menu too?

28:26.600 --> 28:28.068
Okay, stop it.

28:28.102 --> 28:29.636
I wanna finish what I'm doin'.

28:29.669 --> 28:30.604
I'm hungry.

28:30.637 --> 28:31.905
Oh my God.

28:31.938 --> 28:33.707
- Whoo, geez.
- What?

28:33.740 --> 28:34.908
Your hands are freezin'.

28:34.941 --> 28:35.942
Well, it's winter time, baby.

28:35.976 --> 28:37.677
What you expect?

28:37.711 --> 28:38.912
Besides, I said I was
gonna give you a massage,

28:38.945 --> 28:41.681
and I'm a man of my word.

28:41.715 --> 28:43.650
Yeah, two weeks later.

28:43.683 --> 28:44.818
Thanks, honey.

28:46.753 --> 28:48.655
Oh!

28:48.688 --> 28:49.723
Listen, man, you gotta go

28:49.756 --> 28:50.891
to the doctor for this.

28:50.924 --> 28:52.626
It's been sore too long.

28:52.659 --> 28:54.027
No, it's fine.

28:54.060 --> 28:55.061
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

28:55.096 --> 28:57.998
It's not fine.

28:58.031 --> 29:00.667
Okay, I'll go see somebody.

29:00.700 --> 29:01.568
Good.

29:05.806 --> 29:07.040
How does you feel now?

29:07.073 --> 29:08.842
It feels good?

29:08.875 --> 29:09.743
Yes.

29:13.613 --> 29:14.815
What's wrong?

29:15.749 --> 29:17.050
Ruth, what's wrong?

29:18.919 --> 29:19.853
Is it your dad?

29:19.886 --> 29:22.756
What did they say about him?

29:22.789 --> 29:26.493
They say daddy's
got pancreatic cancer.

29:30.764 --> 29:31.631
No.

29:35.136 --> 29:36.103
It's spread.

29:37.771 --> 29:41.108
He needs to get surgery to
remove a mass on his liver.

29:41.142 --> 29:41.975
When?

29:42.008 --> 29:43.610
Next week.

29:43.643 --> 29:44.611
Well, why didn't

29:44.644 --> 29:45.846
- you say anything to me?
- I did,

29:45.879 --> 29:47.148
over and over again.

29:47.181 --> 29:48.748
You were too busy.

29:50.050 --> 29:52.153
Everything is gonna be okay.

29:52.186 --> 29:53.053
I promise.

29:54.054 --> 29:54.921
Trust me.

31:15.001 --> 31:16.970
- Good morning.
- Oh, good morning.

31:17.003 --> 31:18.605
- You okay?
- Yeah.

31:18.638 --> 31:20.006
I'll be in my
office if you need me.

31:20.040 --> 31:20.874
Okay.

31:20.907 --> 31:21.675
All right.

31:21.708 --> 31:23.009
All right,
talk to you later.

31:23.043 --> 31:24.245
All right, see you later.

31:24.278 --> 31:25.379
Oh,
Ruth, good morning.

31:25.413 --> 31:28.715
Did you get that email that I
sent about the Walter estate?

31:28.748 --> 31:30.084
They want a conference
call this afternoon,

31:30.117 --> 31:31.051
and I put it on your calendar,

31:31.085 --> 31:32.986
- Okay, that's fine.
- and I need you to confirm

31:33.019 --> 31:34.955
the dates that you
wanna go to Chicago

31:34.988 --> 31:36.856
- for the Partners Conference.
- Okay.

31:36.890 --> 31:38.259
- Fine, I'll do-
- Oh, and Don just called.

31:38.292 --> 31:40.227
He said he's faxing over
the summons for Walker.

31:40.261 --> 31:41.162
Okay, Cherise.

31:41.195 --> 31:42.296
I can't really talk to you

31:42.330 --> 31:43.997
- about this right now.
- And I need you to put in your time,

31:44.030 --> 31:44.998
so that I can draft that invoice

31:45.031 --> 31:46.866
- for Hughes Lovells -
- Cherise, I can't talk now.

31:46.900 --> 31:48.068
- I gotta go, okay?
- Okay.

31:48.102 --> 31:49.869
- And coffee's on your desk.
- Thank you.

31:49.903 --> 31:51.105
Oh, wait, there's the fax now.

31:54.908 --> 31:56.977
Yeah, he's a crook all right.

31:57.010 --> 32:00.147
By the way, your husband
called, he said...

33:17.891 --> 33:18.858
Hi, Ruth.

33:21.162 --> 33:23.264
Did you get my email?

33:23.297 --> 33:24.298
About Glick?

33:25.232 --> 33:26.800
I sent it three days ago.

33:28.068 --> 33:30.237
We're set to meet
in about 30 minutes.

33:30.271 --> 33:32.072
And I thought you mentioned

33:32.106 --> 33:34.040
something about another brief
you wanted me to go over?

33:42.949 --> 33:45.219
I hope you like the flowers.

33:46.087 --> 33:49.356
I thought maybe you could
give them to your father.

33:49.390 --> 33:52.359
- Jackson, I don't really-
- Just hear me out,

33:52.393 --> 33:53.993
- please.
- No, Jackson.

33:54.027 --> 33:55.262
Wait.

33:55.296 --> 33:57.931
Listen, you have only
been here for a month,

33:57.964 --> 33:59.999
and you've already...

34:00.033 --> 34:02.336
No, I can't do this.

34:02.369 --> 34:03.370
No, just go.

34:04.405 --> 34:06.173
Just leave, please.

34:07.374 --> 34:08.975
- We-
- Don't, no!

34:09.008 --> 34:10.377
Don't touch me.

34:10.411 --> 34:12.979
I'm married, it's wrong.

34:13.012 --> 34:14.115
This is wrong.

34:15.982 --> 34:17.016
Please, just go.

34:17.050 --> 34:18.017
- Please.
- I'm not going anywhere

34:18.051 --> 34:19.220
- until you listen to me.
- What?

34:19.253 --> 34:20.321
Are you crazy?

34:20.354 --> 34:22.889
Are you trying to
ruin my career too?

34:22.922 --> 34:24.258
What is wrong with you?

34:24.291 --> 34:26.826
- Well, listen to me then.
- Okay, listen, okay?

34:28.295 --> 34:29.330
I'm sorry.

34:30.197 --> 34:31.064
I'm sorry.

34:31.098 --> 34:33.434
- Why would you said that?
- Because I am.

34:33.467 --> 34:35.136
I never should have
lead you on like that.

34:35.169 --> 34:36.035
I just...

34:42.176 --> 34:43.310
I shouldn't have done...

34:43.344 --> 34:45.312
I'm really, really sorry.

34:45.346 --> 34:47.947
You didn't seem all
that sorry three days ago.

34:47.981 --> 34:49.048
What?

34:49.083 --> 34:51.050
Oh, oh, okay, okay.

34:51.085 --> 34:52.419
Wrong thing to say.

34:55.855 --> 34:58.858
I respect you, and
I care about you.

35:01.428 --> 35:03.364
I had no right to approach
you the way that I did,

35:03.397 --> 35:07.368
especially since I
know you're married.

35:07.401 --> 35:08.235
I just...

35:10.371 --> 35:13.274
I couldn't stand
seeing you crying.

35:15.476 --> 35:16.910
I care about you.

35:20.314 --> 35:21.482
You've done so much for me.

35:21.515 --> 35:23.016
Since I've gotten here,

35:23.049 --> 35:25.252
you're the one who's
helped me the most.

35:25.286 --> 35:27.887
It's like I see myself in you,

35:29.490 --> 35:31.691
ever since we first met.

35:33.059 --> 35:34.328
and I just knew.

35:36.297 --> 35:41.202
And then nobody has got my
back the way that you do.

35:42.169 --> 35:43.237
I wouldn't be here without you.

35:43.270 --> 35:45.939
So, please, please, forgive me.

35:47.508 --> 35:48.442
I am sorry.

35:50.444 --> 35:52.011
All right, okay.

35:53.214 --> 35:55.014
I listened to you.

35:55.048 --> 35:55.915
Now go.

35:57.284 --> 35:59.086
Starting tomorrow, George
is gonna be your new mentor.

35:59.119 --> 36:01.288
I think that would be best.

36:03.290 --> 36:08.027
Well, I just don't want
this to affect our friendship.

36:11.232 --> 36:12.166
I love you.

36:20.006 --> 36:22.509
Get the hell outta my office.

36:23.510 --> 36:25.279
Now!

36:36.357 --> 36:38.057
Hey.

36:38.092 --> 36:38.925
Hey, baby.

36:38.958 --> 36:40.361
What are you doin' here?

36:40.394 --> 36:42.563
I thought we'd
have some lunch together.

36:42.596 --> 36:44.030
You hungry?

36:44.063 --> 36:44.998
Oh, yeah.

36:46.200 --> 36:48.067
I didn't know
you had a meeting.

36:48.102 --> 36:52.005
I called your assistant earlier,
and she said you were free.

36:52.038 --> 36:54.575
She tried you once again,
but once I got here,

36:54.608 --> 36:56.277
but you didn't answer,

36:56.310 --> 36:58.579
so I thought I'd come on
back here and get you myself.

36:58.612 --> 36:59.580
Oh.

36:59.613 --> 37:00.980
No, no.

37:01.014 --> 37:02.283
We don't have a meeting.

37:02.316 --> 37:05.352
This is our new
associate, and my mentee.

37:06.186 --> 37:09.223
We just had to go over a
brief, but we're done now.

37:09.256 --> 37:10.457
Yeah, we're done now.

37:10.491 --> 37:12.058
My apologies, sir.

37:12.092 --> 37:13.294
Jackson Black.

37:13.327 --> 37:14.595
Black, no worries.

37:14.628 --> 37:15.396
Brandon Stewart.

37:15.429 --> 37:18.198
Oh, trust me, I
know who you are.

37:18.232 --> 37:20.567
It is an honor to
meet you, brother.

37:20.601 --> 37:22.603
I've read some of your cases.

37:22.636 --> 37:26.507
I gotta say, you are
a real inspiration.

37:26.540 --> 37:28.542
Definitely know how to win.

37:28.575 --> 37:31.445
Thanks, I learned my
best tactics from Ruth.

37:31.478 --> 37:35.082
Me too.

37:36.417 --> 37:39.052
Well, I gotta go, and get
these gloves for Glick.

37:39.086 --> 37:40.521
So, I'll let you
know how it goes.

37:40.554 --> 37:42.156
Gloves?

37:42.189 --> 37:45.459
Oh yeah, yeah, she's
a real germaphobe.

37:45.492 --> 37:50.197
Hey, I can tell you, our
clients, some real nutcases.

37:51.598 --> 37:54.335
By now, I just do whatever
they want me to do.

37:55.302 --> 37:57.371
Whether wearing gloves,

37:57.404 --> 38:01.108
massaging their backs,
kissin' their necks.

38:01.141 --> 38:04.244
You know, we do what
others won't do,

38:04.278 --> 38:07.214
that's what makes
us so successful.

38:07.748 --> 38:10.351
I'll do anything for my clients.

38:10.384 --> 38:13.654
Without them, we wouldn't
be anything, you know?

38:13.687 --> 38:15.021
We owe them.

38:16.290 --> 38:18.057
- Hmm.
- Yep.

38:21.228 --> 38:22.229
Your hands are freezing, man.

38:22.262 --> 38:23.497
Well,

38:23.530 --> 38:26.667
another reason I wear gloves.

38:26.700 --> 38:27.534
See you.

38:27.568 --> 38:28.602
Ruth.

38:32.706 --> 38:34.141
I can't believe you're here.

38:35.376 --> 38:37.644
It's so good to see you.

38:37.678 --> 38:39.146
You too.

38:40.381 --> 38:41.615
I figured you could
use a little break.

38:43.083 --> 38:44.884
We can eat in the park.

38:46.720 --> 38:48.689
Oh, yeah, that would be nice.

38:48.722 --> 38:50.557
That'd be really nice.

38:50.591 --> 38:52.226
You all right?

38:52.259 --> 38:53.427
You feel sweaty.

38:53.460 --> 38:54.428
Yeah, I'm fine.

38:54.461 --> 38:56.597
I'm just thinkin' about daddy,

38:56.630 --> 38:59.433
and a client's
sentencing is coming up,

38:59.466 --> 39:00.534
among many other things.

39:00.567 --> 39:02.068
So just...

39:02.102 --> 39:04.271
I just got a lot on my mind.

39:04.304 --> 39:08.074
Well, I hope this
Jackson is doing his part

39:09.743 --> 39:12.413
helping you with your clients.

39:12.446 --> 39:13.547
Is he any good?

39:13.580 --> 39:15.649
Oh, yeah, he's good.

39:15.682 --> 39:16.717
He's really good.

39:16.750 --> 39:18.452
Wow!

39:18.485 --> 39:20.320
Who got you these?

39:20.354 --> 39:22.389
Oh, the other partners,

39:23.257 --> 39:26.727
they realized it was my eight
year anniversary working here,

39:26.760 --> 39:29.096
so they got me these.

39:29.763 --> 39:33.500
And yeah, I'm so glad
that you saw these,

39:33.534 --> 39:35.636
because I'm gonna put
these in some water,

39:35.669 --> 39:38.205
so I can give them to daddy.

39:38.238 --> 39:43.243
Yeah, I'm gonna...

40:01.695 --> 40:03.564
Yeah, okay.

40:07.301 --> 40:08.702
Where's the water?

40:09.736 --> 40:11.238
What?

40:11.271 --> 40:14.308
You didn't put any
water in the vase.

40:32.693 --> 40:34.461
All right, let's go.

40:34.495 --> 40:37.397
- Let's not waste any time.
- Okay.

40:37.431 --> 40:38.799
Let me just get my...

40:38.832 --> 40:39.700
Okay.

40:45.739 --> 40:47.508
Hello?

40:47.541 --> 40:48.709
Hey, daddy.

40:48.742 --> 40:50.177
How you feelin'?

40:51.778 --> 40:52.779
Oh, good.

40:54.715 --> 40:57.651
Oh, I'm so glad the
surgery went well.

40:57.684 --> 40:59.018
I was worried.

41:00.487 --> 41:02.322
When do they say you're
gonna be able to come home?

41:03.857 --> 41:05.726
Only a few days?

41:05.759 --> 41:07.026
That's great!

41:08.529 --> 41:09.463
Oh, my gosh.

41:11.465 --> 41:12.599
Where's Junior?

41:14.268 --> 41:15.235
Okay.

41:16.603 --> 41:19.373
Yeah, well I'll stop
by later on tonight

41:19.406 --> 41:21.575
just to check in on you.

41:21.608 --> 41:22.476
Okay?

41:24.244 --> 41:25.412
All right.

41:25.445 --> 41:26.680
I love you, daddy.

41:26.713 --> 41:27.781
Get some sleep.

41:29.750 --> 41:30.784
Bye.

41:41.795 --> 41:43.730
- Hey, baby.
- Something smells good.

41:43.764 --> 41:44.765
New perfume?

41:46.767 --> 41:47.834
Yeah.

41:47.868 --> 41:48.802
Wow, you noticed.

41:48.835 --> 41:50.537
Brandon didn't even notice.

41:51.438 --> 41:52.706
I like it.

41:52.739 --> 41:53.774
Thanks.

41:55.509 --> 41:57.411
Nice dress.

41:58.879 --> 42:02.716
You know, George can't
keep his eyes off you.

42:02.749 --> 42:05.819
He can't resist your
beautiful smile.

42:08.355 --> 42:10.524
Do you mind if I undo my tie?

42:10.557 --> 42:12.759
It's kinda hot in here.

42:12.793 --> 42:15.596
Yeah, go ahead,
sure, go for it.

42:19.900 --> 42:21.501
Tell me, Ruth,

42:23.437 --> 42:26.573
while you're tending
to everyone else,

42:27.574 --> 42:29.376
who's tending to you?

42:32.946 --> 42:35.282
My hands could tend to you.

42:37.851 --> 42:40.120
They know where it hurts.

42:51.632 --> 42:52.766
Does that feel good?

43:07.714 --> 43:08.849
Hey, baby.

43:08.882 --> 43:09.850
What's up?

43:11.351 --> 43:12.552
Nothing much.

43:13.920 --> 43:15.489
You okay?

43:15.522 --> 43:16.456
Yeah.

43:17.491 --> 43:18.859
How was your day?

43:22.729 --> 43:24.698
Busy, as usual.

43:24.731 --> 43:28.969
I was in and out of trial
for most of the day,

43:29.002 --> 43:31.838
which was daunting,
but it is what it is.

43:34.007 --> 43:36.476
I had three clients today,
can you believe that?

43:36.510 --> 43:38.679
Three clients being sentenced.

43:38.712 --> 43:41.815
Luckily, none of them will
be seeing any jail time,

43:41.848 --> 43:44.518
just a slap on the wrist.

43:44.551 --> 43:47.187
They even elected a new judge.

43:47.988 --> 43:51.458
So you know I had to pull
all the punches for that one.

43:51.491 --> 43:52.759
I had to do legal.

43:52.793 --> 43:56.730
I had to setup the
documents, the beginning.

43:56.763 --> 43:59.433
I had to cross reference brief.

43:59.466 --> 44:01.935
Honey, I need to talk to you.

44:09.476 --> 44:10.877
- Shoot.
- I just...

44:15.682 --> 44:16.650
I just, I...

44:19.853 --> 44:21.221
I just want...

44:24.624 --> 44:26.993
- Uh-huh.
- I love you so much,

44:27.027 --> 44:28.395
- and I-
- Yeah?

44:35.669 --> 44:37.738
I made a mistake.

44:37.771 --> 44:40.440
Did you bleach one of
my vintage jersey's again?

44:40.474 --> 44:45.045
- No.
- Then what do you mean?

44:45.079 --> 44:48.815
I mean I did something
I shouldn't have.

44:51.918 --> 44:53.420
I never...

44:53.453 --> 44:55.756
It was never ever
a sexual thing.

44:59.493 --> 45:00.961
You cheated on me?

45:00.994 --> 45:03.029
It was not sex!

45:03.063 --> 45:04.664
Then what
the hell was it then?

45:04.698 --> 45:05.832
Okay, listen.

45:05.866 --> 45:07.501
I just...

45:07.534 --> 45:08.902
I just kissed him.

45:08.935 --> 45:13.573
After every damn thing
I've done for us, for you?

45:13.607 --> 45:17.844
And you stick your tongue
down another man's throat?

45:20.081 --> 45:21.848
Everything I've done,

45:23.884 --> 45:24.951
that ain't good enough for you?

45:24.985 --> 45:26.853
You mean everything
to me, okay?

45:26.887 --> 45:28.021
But I told him to stop.

45:28.054 --> 45:29.623
I told him to leave me alone.

45:29.656 --> 45:30.524
Who?

45:32.893 --> 45:33.760
Who is he?

45:34.661 --> 45:37.063
You don't know him.

45:37.098 --> 45:39.100
Is it that new guy, huh?

45:39.133 --> 45:40.667
Your mentee?

45:40.700 --> 45:41.568
No, no.

45:43.137 --> 45:45.806
Sweetheart, please.

45:45.839 --> 45:46.840
Flowers...

45:51.578 --> 45:54.748
He bought you those
flowers, didn't he?

45:57.751 --> 46:00.554
And you were hiding
them from me.

46:04.624 --> 46:08.895
And that jackass had the
nerve to shake my hand.

46:08.929 --> 46:09.896
I could kill him.

46:09.930 --> 46:10.931
No.

46:10.964 --> 46:11.998
- You know I could.
- No.

46:12.032 --> 46:13.533
Honey, listen to me.

46:13.567 --> 46:15.669
This is my fault, okay?

46:15.702 --> 46:17.104
I made the mistake.

46:17.138 --> 46:18.638
Just tell me what...

46:18.672 --> 46:20.974
I'll do anything
not to lose you.

46:21.007 --> 46:22.075
Anything!

46:22.109 --> 46:23.043
- Anything?
- Yes!

46:27.948 --> 46:30.617
Since you wanna be in
someone else's bed so much,

46:30.650 --> 46:31.985
I don't want you in mine.

46:32.018 --> 46:33.120
I didn't even sleep with him!

46:33.154 --> 46:34.988
Can we just work this out?

46:35.021 --> 46:37.158
Work out this sofa!

46:37.191 --> 46:39.626
Work out these sheets!

46:39.659 --> 46:41.162
Work out these silk pajamas.

46:41.195 --> 46:43.063
No, wait, I bought these.

46:44.564 --> 46:45.966
You remember when I
bought these, Ruth?

46:45.999 --> 46:47.168
You remember?

46:47.201 --> 46:50.604
Because you wanted
satin pajamas, right?

46:55.142 --> 46:57.043
Seriously, Ruth?

46:57.077 --> 46:58.812
Are we serious?

46:58.845 --> 47:02.183
Did you seriously leave
a cup in the sink?

47:02.216 --> 47:04.017
Well, don't worry about it.

47:04.050 --> 47:04.918
I got this!

47:04.951 --> 47:06.786
No!

47:06.820 --> 47:09.890
There, now no
one has to wash it,

47:09.923 --> 47:12.193
since we're breaking dishes.

47:12.226 --> 47:14.095
Look, I worked it out.

47:15.695 --> 47:18.199
- I'm working it out for us.
- Baby, please stop!

47:18.232 --> 47:19.733
Please!

47:22.236 --> 47:24.571
And while
you're down here,

47:24.604 --> 47:26.940
think about how your gonna
work out the rest of your life!

49:06.173 --> 49:09.276
- Praise the Lord, everybody!
- Yeah.

49:09.310 --> 49:10.444
I said,

49:10.478 --> 49:15.216
praise the Lord, everybody

50:13.006 --> 50:18.079
I wanted to remember the
broken body of our Lord Jesus.

50:18.112 --> 50:21.282
Now during your
personal tribulations,

50:22.416 --> 50:24.884
recall the blood of Jesus.

50:26.153 --> 50:27.854
And the same mercy.

50:29.323 --> 50:31.325
Did you hear what I said?

50:31.358 --> 50:35.028
- I said, the same mercy.
- Same mercy.

50:35.061 --> 50:38.332
That he showed you,
extend it to others.

50:40.267 --> 50:44.238
But start, first and
foremost, in your house.

50:46.039 --> 50:47.408
The Bible says,

50:47.441 --> 50:51.811
"A house divided against
itself shall not stand".

50:55.349 --> 50:57.016
- Amen?
- Amen.

50:57.050 --> 50:59.253
So
children, love your parents.

50:59.286 --> 51:00.421
- Yes.
- Yes.

51:00.454 --> 51:02.021
Parents, your children.

51:02.055 --> 51:04.924
Husbands and wives,
and everybody,

51:07.026 --> 51:09.296
walk in the spirit of love.

51:09.330 --> 51:12.966
All your disputes must
be settled at home

51:14.934 --> 51:18.972
before you come to participate
in the divine host.

51:22.942 --> 51:24.211
Understand this,

51:25.379 --> 51:27.981
you cannot expect
the mercy of God

51:30.351 --> 51:35.021
when you yourself do not
intend to extend it to others.

51:36.090 --> 51:37.857
Amen!

51:37.891 --> 51:39.025
- Amen!
- Amen!

51:40.927 --> 51:44.831
I'm gonna ask my son,
Deacon Brandon Stewart,

51:46.500 --> 51:49.403
to come and pray
over the host today,

51:50.970 --> 51:54.108
the body and blood of
our Lord Jesus Christ.

51:54.141 --> 51:55.242
Deacon.

51:55.276 --> 51:59.246
Amen!

52:04.185 --> 52:06.353
Glory to your name, Lord.

52:06.387 --> 52:09.290
We pray that you bless the host

52:09.323 --> 52:14.228
as we remember the sacrifice
you made on Calvary.

52:14.261 --> 52:16.163
Forgive us all our sins,

52:17.131 --> 52:19.266
and help us to show mercy,

52:20.401 --> 52:22.902
and forgive the unforgivable.

52:24.070 --> 52:26.340
Teach us to love each other.

52:27.441 --> 52:30.110
Show us how to
love the unlovable.

52:31.512 --> 52:32.413
- Amen.
- Amen.

52:32.446 --> 52:34.881
- Thank you, son.
- Amen.

52:44.191 --> 52:47.927
Son, the body and
blood of our Lord Jesus.

52:59.240 --> 53:00.374
The body
and the blood of Christ.

53:00.407 --> 53:02.041
Amen.

53:04.578 --> 53:07.914
I think I have some
organic butter in the fridge.

53:07.947 --> 53:08.948
I bean
butter in the trunk!

53:08.982 --> 53:10.551
Your into
this organic thing, eh?

53:10.584 --> 53:11.518
I need some meat

53:11.552 --> 53:13.220
- on my plate, though.
- Can you pass the bread?

53:13.254 --> 53:14.488
- Yeah.
- I got you.

53:14.521 --> 53:15.422
Oh, you got me, son?

53:15.456 --> 53:16.523
- Oh, okay.
- You know Ruth?

53:16.557 --> 53:17.625
Brethren, brethren - - If
you had some of those tongs-

53:17.658 --> 53:20.160
- Let's pause for prayer.
- You know, it would be easier

53:20.194 --> 53:21.395
- to pick up the corn.
- Brethren, brethren.

53:21.428 --> 53:22.463
Brethren, okay.

53:24.098 --> 53:25.232
Let's prayer.

53:25.266 --> 53:26.200
- Ew, I got this.
- Yeah.

53:26.233 --> 53:27.368
Y'all bow.

53:29.203 --> 53:30.437
You got this, baby, right?

53:30.471 --> 53:32.005
- Come on.
- Come on, sweetheart.

53:32.038 --> 53:33.374
Hold my hands.

53:33.407 --> 53:34.974
Okay.

53:36.610 --> 53:41.948
Dear God, thank you so much
for this food we 'bout to eat.

53:42.483 --> 53:43.584
Lord God, El Shaddai, Jireh,

53:43.617 --> 53:46.487
we just ask that it's flavorful,

53:46.520 --> 53:50.557
because we know that Ruth
only uses organic ingredients,

53:50.591 --> 53:52.593
and so we also know
that she does not use

53:52.626 --> 53:54.994
adequate amounts
of salt and pepper.

53:55.028 --> 53:58.031
God, I also ask that we
don't get sick this time,

53:58.064 --> 54:00.967
like we did when she
made that meatloaf.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.270
Lord, we know that you are able.

54:03.304 --> 54:05.372
God, and I also wanna
thank you so much

54:05.406 --> 54:08.108
for getting my SNAP
application approved, God.

54:08.142 --> 54:10.544
So now, I don't have
to ask Tyriek, Rashad,

54:10.577 --> 54:13.180
or Cornelius for anything, Lord.

54:13.213 --> 54:14.214
God, I thank you so much,

54:14.248 --> 54:16.450
because we both know they
ain't good for nothin'.

54:16.483 --> 54:18.385
Thank you for keepin' it 100.

54:18.419 --> 54:19.353
Amen!

54:19.386 --> 54:20.321
- Amen.
- Amen.

54:20.354 --> 54:21.221
- Amen.
- Amen.

54:21.255 --> 54:22.589
- Did y'all feel that?
- It'll be all right.

54:22.623 --> 54:23.490
Yeah.

54:23.524 --> 54:24.558
No!

54:24.591 --> 54:25.626
I don't trust
you anyway, Tommy.

54:25.659 --> 54:29.028
Ever since you became a
Muslim, you don't feel nothin'.

54:29.062 --> 54:30.431
Stop lettin' the devil use you.

54:30.464 --> 54:31.365
Mm-hmm.

54:31.398 --> 54:33.200
See, you know what that is?

54:33.233 --> 54:36.069
That right there, that's your
problem, my beautiful sister.

54:36.103 --> 54:39.640
See, you lettin' that
white man get to your mind.

54:39.673 --> 54:41.141
You know what I'm sayin'?

54:41.175 --> 54:45.011
See, I refuse to believe
that some white Jesus

54:45.679 --> 54:49.616
is gonna bless my food,
and provide for me.

54:49.650 --> 54:51.652
See, that's that slave mentality

54:51.685 --> 54:53.253
that they puttin' in you, huh?

54:53.287 --> 54:54.588
That's that mind poison.

54:54.621 --> 54:55.422
You understand what
I'm tellin' you?

54:55.456 --> 54:56.390
First off,

54:56.423 --> 54:58.392
Jesus wasn't white, okay?

54:58.425 --> 54:59.526
We're not prayin'
to a white man,

54:59.560 --> 55:02.529
and it's not a white man in
the sky answerin' our prayers.

55:02.563 --> 55:05.165
Well, he seems to be
providin' them food stamps

55:05.199 --> 55:07.234
for you every once
and a while, huh?

55:07.267 --> 55:09.403
How them welfare
checks comin', sis?

55:09.436 --> 55:10.571
Jesus give me

55:10.604 --> 55:12.606
- my welfare check.
- Tommy, shut-up, man.

55:12.639 --> 55:15.309
Nobody ain't ask you nothin'.

55:16.210 --> 55:19.113
You know my name
is not Tommy anymore.

55:19.146 --> 55:22.483
My name, which was given
to me by my brothers,

55:22.516 --> 55:24.585
is Jabari Jahi El-Baruch.

55:27.588 --> 55:30.557
Sweetie, I sure hope you
get over this phase of yours

55:30.591 --> 55:33.627
with this Nation
of Muslim business.

55:33.660 --> 55:38.665
You know your mama and daddy
did not raise you like this!

55:39.466 --> 55:42.302
Taylor, how you feelin'
since your operation?

55:42.336 --> 55:43.270
I'm feelin' all right.

55:43.303 --> 55:44.705
Feelin' good.

55:44.738 --> 55:46.573
I just have to take
a little bit easier.

55:46.607 --> 55:48.175
You know what I'm sayin'?

55:48.208 --> 55:52.546
But I got Junior here
sometime helpin' me out.

55:52.579 --> 55:55.315
By the way, baby girl,

55:55.349 --> 55:56.717
you were supposed to
come by last night.

55:56.750 --> 55:58.452
What happened?

55:58.485 --> 56:01.588
Oh, Brandon and I had
somethin' come up last night

56:01.622 --> 56:04.224
that we had to take care of.

56:04.258 --> 56:06.393
Oh, okay.

56:06.427 --> 56:08.228
It took most of the night.

56:08.262 --> 56:09.129
Oh!

56:11.665 --> 56:13.567
We know what y'all
talkin' about.

56:13.600 --> 56:15.636
Y'all was doin' the nasty.

56:15.669 --> 56:18.238
- Hush.
- My black Nubian

56:18.272 --> 56:20.340
- Wesley Snipes.
- Junior, shut up.

56:20.374 --> 56:23.210
Oh.

56:24.344 --> 56:26.146
- Food is good.
- Daddy?

56:26.180 --> 56:27.281
Wait a minute.

56:28.515 --> 56:30.250
- No, nothin' there.
- Daddy,

56:30.284 --> 56:32.586
did they release you
from the hospital?

56:32.619 --> 56:34.521
- Well, no, but-
- Wait!

56:35.622 --> 56:37.257
What were you doin' here?

56:37.291 --> 56:39.259
It's Sunday
dinner, and you know,

56:39.293 --> 56:42.196
so I decided to
take a walk, okay?

56:42.229 --> 56:43.130
Just a little walk.

56:43.163 --> 56:45.532
How long have you been gone?

56:45.566 --> 56:47.768
Well, they would probably
tell you four hours,

56:47.801 --> 56:49.136
- Oh!
- But, I mean,

56:49.169 --> 56:50.404
- what's an hour or two?
- My God.

56:50.437 --> 56:51.305
Wait.

56:53.173 --> 56:55.175
We not goin' for a walk?

56:56.710 --> 56:58.779
I was gonna take him
back right after we ate.

56:58.812 --> 57:00.647
Junior,
you are an idiot!

57:00.681 --> 57:02.182
I'm not going back there.

57:02.216 --> 57:03.617
That place smells like liniment,

57:03.650 --> 57:05.452
- and the food tastes-
- Okay, okay.

57:05.486 --> 57:06.553
No, no!

57:06.587 --> 57:07.421
Stop, daddy.

57:07.454 --> 57:09.456
- Like doodoo-
- Ruth, I was just noticin'

57:09.490 --> 57:12.493
that your fireplace
is a little dusty.

57:12.526 --> 57:14.528
Do you ever get a
chance to clean?

57:14.561 --> 57:15.562
Excuse me?

57:15.596 --> 57:18.799
You know, vinegar is my
solution to everything.

57:18.832 --> 57:21.768
You should try it sometime,
and watch it work.

57:21.802 --> 57:23.704
And you know, another thing.

57:23.737 --> 57:26.740
When you set out your
utensils for your guests,

57:26.773 --> 57:28.308
you should polish them a little

57:28.342 --> 57:30.244
so that the
watermarks won't show.

57:31.211 --> 57:33.680
I'll teach you before we leave.

57:33.714 --> 57:36.416
Hey, man, can
you pass the pulled pork?

57:36.450 --> 57:38.552
From one black man
to another, okay?

57:38.585 --> 57:41.555
Don't consume that swine, man.

57:41.588 --> 57:43.724
- He a mess.
- That poison!

57:43.757 --> 57:44.658
Come on, man.

57:44.691 --> 57:46.693
It is a disgusting animal,

57:46.727 --> 57:50.430
and Allah teaches
us, command us, yet,

57:50.464 --> 57:53.467
not to eat that pork, brother.

57:53.500 --> 57:54.434
Come on, now.

57:54.468 --> 57:55.802
Look, don't you read your Bible?

57:55.836 --> 57:59.573
Deuteronomy, Chapter
14, verse eight.

57:59.606 --> 58:01.475
Brother, come on, now.

58:01.508 --> 58:04.211
Put the pork off your fork.

58:04.244 --> 58:06.313
Don't even put it on a spork.

58:06.346 --> 58:10.817
Jesus said that's there's
nothing outside of a person

58:10.851 --> 58:13.587
that goes into him
that defiles him.

58:13.620 --> 58:16.723
- Mm-hmm.
- But what is in a person?

58:16.757 --> 58:18.525
That is what defines him.

58:18.559 --> 58:20.661
- Amen.
- Like the stupidity

58:20.694 --> 58:24.865
that is flowing out of your
mouth right now, Tommy,

58:24.898 --> 58:26.466
that defiles you.

58:26.500 --> 58:30.069
Look, my name is
Jabari Jahi El-Baruch.

58:32.839 --> 58:33.674
Tommy, shut up.

58:33.707 --> 58:35.442
We don't study
there for education.

58:35.475 --> 58:36.777
I'm just happy to be home, yo.

58:36.810 --> 58:38.378
- Mm-hmm.
- Yep.

58:41.782 --> 58:43.317
Nah, man.

58:43.350 --> 58:44.551
What you doin' with that, man?

58:44.585 --> 58:47.788
Drop that right in here.

58:47.821 --> 58:49.856
Where I'm from, don't
nothin' go to waste.

58:49.890 --> 58:52.893
Hey, listen, I
know I got about...

58:52.926 --> 58:55.862
Put all your water bottles
up in this bag, all right?

58:55.896 --> 58:57.798
Got at least a
dollar at this table.

58:57.831 --> 59:00.801
Ruth, do you have
anymore of this Zinfandel?

59:00.834 --> 59:02.736
This is so delicious.

59:02.769 --> 59:05.606
No, ma'am, you drank
my whole collection.

59:06.573 --> 59:07.507
- Oh.
- Oh, that's okay.

59:07.541 --> 59:08.408
I got it.

59:11.845 --> 59:12.879
Ta-da!

59:13.480 --> 59:17.618
Maggie, don't you
think you've had enough?

59:17.651 --> 59:20.654
Jeffrey, I know how
to take care of myself.

59:20.687 --> 59:22.623
I am fully grown, okay?

59:22.656 --> 59:23.824
So Candice.

59:24.891 --> 59:26.893
So how the kids?

59:26.927 --> 59:27.794
How's work?

59:27.828 --> 59:28.895
They're good.

59:30.797 --> 59:33.667
I'm not working right now.

59:33.700 --> 59:35.535
I'm on unemployment,

59:35.569 --> 59:38.372
but it's just a
temporary situation

59:38.405 --> 59:40.607
leading to a divine altercation.

59:40.641 --> 59:44.845
So yeah, I am starting a
line of hair and extensions,

59:46.546 --> 59:49.416
and they feel and
look like human hair,

59:49.449 --> 59:50.784
but they aren't as expensive.

59:50.817 --> 59:52.619
- Oh.
- And patent is pending.

59:52.653 --> 59:56.556
And we also have a lot of hair
care products and services.

59:56.590 --> 59:58.959
Wow, that's very enterprising!

59:58.992 --> 1:00:00.861
You have clients?

1:00:00.894 --> 1:00:01.862
What, customers?

1:00:01.895 --> 1:00:03.530
- Have you got backing?
- Oh, yeah.

1:00:03.563 --> 1:00:05.465
Yeah, I have a whole bunch,

1:00:05.499 --> 1:00:06.900
and they usually
come to my apartment,

1:00:06.933 --> 1:00:08.769
and we work in the kitchen,

1:00:08.802 --> 1:00:10.370
'cause I gotta use the stove.

1:00:10.404 --> 1:00:12.673
Oh, so it's not
like you have a shop?

1:00:12.706 --> 1:00:15.409
Like this is a real LLC?

1:00:15.442 --> 1:00:16.843
Mm-mm.

1:00:16.943 --> 1:00:18.979
If I did that, I would
mess up my benefits.

1:00:19.012 --> 1:00:20.981
I gotta be fiscally responsible.

1:00:21.014 --> 1:00:22.382
Oh, I see, yeah.

1:00:22.416 --> 1:00:24.718
You gotta fiscal, yeah.

1:00:24.751 --> 1:00:26.987
You know, you in
the system, so yeah.

1:00:27.020 --> 1:00:28.855
You ain't say
a word all night.

1:00:28.889 --> 1:00:30.490
Are
you all right, son?

1:00:30.524 --> 1:00:31.591
I know what's

1:00:31.625 --> 1:00:32.759
- wrong with him.
- Shut up.

1:00:32.793 --> 1:00:34.895
You know, Ruth, you're
not feeding my baby

1:00:34.928 --> 1:00:35.762
the way you should.

1:00:35.796 --> 1:00:39.599
You know, stop all this
organic foolishness,

1:00:39.633 --> 1:00:41.902
and go and buy
some regular food.

1:00:41.935 --> 1:00:44.604
You know, somethin' that
can stick to his ribs.

1:00:44.638 --> 1:00:45.806
Am I right?

1:00:45.839 --> 1:00:46.606
No.

1:00:46.640 --> 1:00:48.508
He
needs some bitters.

1:00:48.542 --> 1:00:51.445
- Do you have some bitters?
- He's not sick.

1:00:51.478 --> 1:00:53.513
Well, then why is he so upset?

1:00:53.547 --> 1:00:55.749
'Cause I cheated on him with
a co-worker two weeks ago,

1:00:55.782 --> 1:00:57.484
and now he wants a divorce.

1:00:57.517 --> 1:01:00.454
Say what?

1:01:14.735 --> 1:01:17.571
Does anybody want
banana pudding?

1:01:20.073 --> 1:01:21.041
Damn.

1:01:21.074 --> 1:01:22.042
See, I'm gonna take this.

1:01:22.075 --> 1:01:22.743
I'm gonna open

1:01:22.776 --> 1:01:24.511
- this up real quick.
- Give me my

1:01:24.544 --> 1:01:26.680
stuff back, Tommy.

1:01:26.713 --> 1:01:27.914
I don't think so.

1:01:27.948 --> 1:01:28.949
I don't think so.

1:01:28.982 --> 1:01:30.617
He'll come back here.

1:01:30.650 --> 1:01:33.520
Anybody don't
want no bean pies?

1:01:35.689 --> 1:01:38.558
Okay, I got bean-citrus juice,

1:01:38.592 --> 1:01:39.726
if you need, in the cooler.

1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:40.594
Anybody?

1:01:40.627 --> 1:01:41.695
In the trunk.

1:01:41.728 --> 1:01:44.564
- Unc, you want a bean seltzer?
- No.

1:01:44.598 --> 1:01:46.433
Oh, damn.

1:02:11.591 --> 1:02:12.826
Are you the Stewarts?

1:02:12.859 --> 1:02:13.794
Bill Caffrey.

1:02:13.827 --> 1:02:14.728
Nice to meet you.

1:02:14.761 --> 1:02:15.595
Brandon Stewart.

1:02:15.629 --> 1:02:16.530
This is Ruth.

1:02:16.563 --> 1:02:17.864
- Your wife?
- Yes.

1:02:17.898 --> 1:02:19.866
You okay, Ruth?

1:02:19.900 --> 1:02:20.667
Yeah, I'm fine.

1:02:20.700 --> 1:02:22.569
Just have a little
bit of a headache.

1:02:22.602 --> 1:02:23.970
I'm fine.

1:02:24.004 --> 1:02:25.005
Have a seat.

1:02:27.073 --> 1:02:29.943
So I know Pastor Stewart
referred you to me.

1:02:29.976 --> 1:02:31.578
Yes, he's my father.

1:02:31.611 --> 1:02:33.080
Why are we here?

1:02:33.114 --> 1:02:34.215
Well, dad referred us to you

1:02:34.248 --> 1:02:37.617
because we've been experiencing
some issues in our marriage,

1:02:37.651 --> 1:02:39.853
and he wants us to forego
any ministry duties

1:02:39.886 --> 1:02:41.621
until further notice,

1:02:41.655 --> 1:02:44.724
until we get our house in order.

1:02:44.758 --> 1:02:48.862
What exactly is it that's
keeping your house out of order?

1:02:48.895 --> 1:02:50.530
Infidelity.

1:02:50.564 --> 1:02:51.598
I see.

1:02:51.631 --> 1:02:52.966
Who?

1:02:52.999 --> 1:02:56.703
I recently had an
incident with a co-worker

1:02:56.736 --> 1:02:58.038
that was inappropriate.

1:02:58.071 --> 1:02:59.906
And you only had sex once?

1:02:59.940 --> 1:03:01.708
No, it was never sex.

1:03:01.741 --> 1:03:04.044
I've only had sex with Brandon.

1:03:05.146 --> 1:03:06.847
I kissed him.

1:03:06.880 --> 1:03:07.948
I see.

1:03:07.981 --> 1:03:10.917
And I'm not sure if I want
to continue this marriage.

1:03:10.951 --> 1:03:14.020
Before we even begin
the counseling process,

1:03:14.054 --> 1:03:16.823
I wanna ask you,
for the time being,

1:03:16.857 --> 1:03:18.592
to get any idea of divorce

1:03:18.625 --> 1:03:20.026
- out of your head.
- Are you kidding me?

1:03:20.060 --> 1:03:21.895
No, I'm not.

1:03:21.928 --> 1:03:24.531
I want us to stop looking into

1:03:24.564 --> 1:03:26.566
our understandings
of the issues.

1:03:26.600 --> 1:03:28.535
I want you guys to consider

1:03:28.568 --> 1:03:30.036
not how you see your marriage,

1:03:30.070 --> 1:03:31.872
but how God sees your marriage.

1:03:31.905 --> 1:03:33.006
Can we all agree to that?

1:03:33.039 --> 1:03:34.040
Deacon?

1:03:34.074 --> 1:03:34.941
Yes.

1:03:36.076 --> 1:03:37.544
Sister?

1:03:38.044 --> 1:03:39.012
Yes.

1:03:39.045 --> 1:03:40.547
Good.

1:03:40.580 --> 1:03:42.149
Now, let's start
from the beginning.

1:03:42.183 --> 1:03:43.917
Brandon, what was
the first thing

1:03:43.950 --> 1:03:45.785
that attracted you to Ruth?

1:03:45.819 --> 1:03:47.554
Where did you meet?

1:03:47.587 --> 1:03:49.923
Well, we met freshman year.

1:03:51.225 --> 1:03:54.761
She was in my classes,
and she was beautiful.

1:03:54.794 --> 1:03:56.130
And as I got to know her,

1:03:56.163 --> 1:03:59.399
I got to see how
kind, thoughtful,

1:04:00.800 --> 1:04:02.802
and absolutely
brilliant she was.

1:04:02.836 --> 1:04:05.106
So when I asked her to go out
with me, and she said yes,

1:04:05.139 --> 1:04:07.208
I couldn't believe it.

1:04:07.241 --> 1:04:10.177
I thought something
was wrong with her.

1:04:10.211 --> 1:04:12.146
We dated for a few years,

1:04:12.179 --> 1:04:14.614
and then she became my wife.

1:04:17.151 --> 1:04:18.952
- And...
- Yes, go on.

1:04:23.257 --> 1:04:25.092
I'm done for now.

1:04:25.126 --> 1:04:26.726
Okay.

1:04:26.760 --> 1:04:28.129
What about you, Ruth?

1:04:28.162 --> 1:04:31.098
Hmm, he was
always so motivated.

1:04:31.132 --> 1:04:32.699
I loved that about him.

1:04:32.732 --> 1:04:33.833
As I got to know him,

1:04:33.867 --> 1:04:38.172
I found him to be so considerate,
and sweet, and gentle.

1:04:42.209 --> 1:04:43.710
And he'd take me
out all the time,

1:04:43.743 --> 1:04:46.880
and we'd just talk for hours.

1:04:46.913 --> 1:04:47.981
I think one night,
we actually went out,

1:04:48.014 --> 1:04:51.118
and just sat there on the lawn,
and then we went to sleep.

1:04:51.152 --> 1:04:52.852
You remember that?

1:04:54.020 --> 1:04:56.257
There was never a dull moment.

1:04:56.290 --> 1:04:57.724
We laughed together.

1:04:57.757 --> 1:04:59.626
We shared together.

1:05:01.027 --> 1:05:02.196
We loved together.

1:05:02.229 --> 1:05:05.266
And soon after school,
we got married,

1:05:05.299 --> 1:05:07.435
and it was great at first.

1:05:09.303 --> 1:05:10.870
It was amazing.

1:05:12.706 --> 1:05:13.840
But then we...

1:05:17.311 --> 1:05:19.045
We just separated.

1:05:19.846 --> 1:05:24.017
Not legally, or anything,
but in every other way.

1:05:24.050 --> 1:05:26.653
Emotionally, spiritually torn.

1:05:27.687 --> 1:05:29.022
It was like night and day.

1:05:29.055 --> 1:05:31.192
And we even planned
to start having kids.

1:05:31.225 --> 1:05:34.060
The doctor said that I
might have infertility.

1:05:34.095 --> 1:05:37.198
After that, everything
just went cold.

1:05:37.231 --> 1:05:38.898
We both made
partner at our firm,

1:05:38.932 --> 1:05:40.767
and we just got busy.

1:05:43.270 --> 1:05:46.072
But Brandon never
seemed to have any time.

1:05:46.107 --> 1:05:47.241
No time to talk.

1:05:48.808 --> 1:05:50.810
No time to make love.

1:05:50.844 --> 1:05:52.679
No time, no anything.

1:05:54.215 --> 1:05:56.716
I felt like I was single again.

1:05:56.750 --> 1:06:00.987
I know how important
intimacy is for every marriage,

1:06:01.021 --> 1:06:04.291
and not being intimate is
a sure sign of a problem.

1:06:04.325 --> 1:06:06.059
But she's lying.

1:06:06.093 --> 1:06:07.328
We have sex.

1:06:07.361 --> 1:06:08.795
- We had sex last Thursday.
- Really?

1:06:08.828 --> 1:06:09.963
Yeah, ask her.

1:06:09.996 --> 1:06:11.931
That's not what
I said, Brandon.

1:06:11.965 --> 1:06:14.168
I said, "We haven't made love".

1:06:14.201 --> 1:06:15.202
Sex, we have.

1:06:15.236 --> 1:06:16.970
Intimacy, we don't.

1:06:17.003 --> 1:06:19.306
Well, you really seem to be
enjoying the lack of intimacy.

1:06:19.340 --> 1:06:21.074
Brandon,
let her finish.

1:06:21.108 --> 1:06:23.310
The only who seems
to enjoy it is you,

1:06:23.344 --> 1:06:26.347
because it's your way,
what you wanna do.

1:06:26.380 --> 1:06:29.049
You don't even consider
what I like, or what I feel.

1:06:29.083 --> 1:06:31.352
You used to really
care about how I felt,

1:06:31.385 --> 1:06:33.287
but now it's all about you.

1:06:33.320 --> 1:06:34.821
It's all selfish.

1:06:34.854 --> 1:06:35.889
Please.

1:06:35.922 --> 1:06:38.359
Aside from lack of intimacy,

1:06:38.392 --> 1:06:42.096
what else would you say is
causing this separation?

1:06:42.129 --> 1:06:43.863
I just feel alone.

1:06:46.766 --> 1:06:50.137
Like he doesn't have
my back on anything.

1:06:50.171 --> 1:06:53.973
I go to the doctor to get
a cyst removed from my leg,

1:06:54.007 --> 1:06:56.110
and he won't go with
me for the procedure.

1:06:56.143 --> 1:06:58.112
He tells me to take a cab home.

1:06:58.145 --> 1:06:59.313
My father is sick.

1:06:59.346 --> 1:07:01.382
He won't even go with
me to the hospital.

1:07:01.415 --> 1:07:04.318
And I'm going crazy with
the stress of it all,

1:07:04.351 --> 1:07:05.985
and he won't even
be there to support,

1:07:06.019 --> 1:07:08.289
or just help around the house.

1:07:09.856 --> 1:07:13.260
Ruth, I have a responsibility
to take care of us.

1:07:13.294 --> 1:07:15.196
Many times, when you ask
me to go out with you,

1:07:15.229 --> 1:07:17.264
or to be with you
during these times,

1:07:17.298 --> 1:07:19.266
I have things that
are due the next day,

1:07:19.300 --> 1:07:21.102
or within a few hours.

1:07:21.135 --> 1:07:23.837
And secondly, you know I hate
doctors offices and hospitals.

1:07:23.870 --> 1:07:25.339
It's all very traumatic for me.

1:07:25.372 --> 1:07:27.408
Don't you see how
selfish that is?

1:07:27.441 --> 1:07:29.376
- But wait-
- And how selfish you are?

1:07:29.410 --> 1:07:30.177
- Hold up.
- Baby, there's more

1:07:30.211 --> 1:07:32.279
to our life than
just work and money.

1:07:32.313 --> 1:07:33.880
I need you to be there.

1:07:33.913 --> 1:07:35.149
For trying to keep
a roof over our heads,

1:07:35.182 --> 1:07:36.015
or food in the fridge?

1:07:36.049 --> 1:07:36.983
You're not even

1:07:37.016 --> 1:07:37.884
- listening to me.
- Guys, guys.

1:07:37.917 --> 1:07:39.853
But clearly, I can't
be as selfish as my wife

1:07:39.886 --> 1:07:41.355
who goes off and gets her
needs met with another man?

1:07:42.423 --> 1:07:44.191
Baby, what?

1:07:44.225 --> 1:07:45.426
What can I do?

1:07:45.459 --> 1:07:48.027
What can I do, or
give you, or say

1:07:48.061 --> 1:07:51.064
to let you know how
much I love you?

1:07:52.466 --> 1:07:54.934
You know, Brandon,

1:07:54.968 --> 1:07:57.036
when you were in your
season of dishonesty,

1:07:57.070 --> 1:07:59.240
I didn't treat you like this.

1:07:59.273 --> 1:08:01.242
Hey, when I found out
about your secret,

1:08:01.275 --> 1:08:02.376
I didn't do this to you.

1:08:02.409 --> 1:08:03.977
- Secret?
- Really?

1:08:04.010 --> 1:08:06.147
- You wanna go there?
- Yeah.

1:08:07.281 --> 1:08:08.415
Why even bring this up?

1:08:08.449 --> 1:08:09.416
That was years ago!

1:08:09.450 --> 1:08:10.950
This about you, not me!

1:08:10.984 --> 1:08:12.186
Brandon, what is
she talkin' about?

1:08:12.219 --> 1:08:13.454
- It's not relevant.
- Yes, it is!

1:08:13.487 --> 1:08:14.821
- Tell him!
- No!

1:08:15.356 --> 1:08:16.357
A year...

1:08:16.390 --> 1:08:17.291
- About two years into-
- Ruth!

1:08:17.324 --> 1:08:18.057
Excuse you.

1:08:18.092 --> 1:08:20.927
About two years
into our marriage,

1:08:20.960 --> 1:08:24.030
I discovered that Brandon
was watching pornography.

1:08:24.063 --> 1:08:25.132
Well, here we go.

1:08:25.166 --> 1:08:27.033
Ruth playing the victim.

1:08:27.066 --> 1:08:28.835
- Really?
- Yes.

1:08:28.868 --> 1:08:30.104
I found magazines

1:08:30.137 --> 1:08:34.375
inside the bottom of his
desk drawer by mistake,

1:08:34.408 --> 1:08:36.976
then I looked on his
laptop and our computer,

1:08:37.010 --> 1:08:38.878
and I found a whole lot more.

1:08:38.912 --> 1:08:40.247
He was addicted.

1:08:40.281 --> 1:08:43.016
And when I confronted him
about it, Brandon apologized.

1:08:43.049 --> 1:08:44.485
He said he was sorry.

1:08:44.518 --> 1:08:46.187
Said he would never do it
again, and I forgave him.

1:08:46.220 --> 1:08:48.289
Are you still struggling?

1:08:48.322 --> 1:08:51.292
Are you still struggling?

1:08:51.325 --> 1:08:54.361
No, I haven't looked
at anything since then.

1:08:54.395 --> 1:08:58.998
Even though I was hurt,
and upset, and confused,

1:08:59.032 --> 1:09:01.402
I stood with him
because I love him.

1:09:01.435 --> 1:09:03.036
But now the tables have turned,

1:09:03.069 --> 1:09:04.405
and he's not standing with me.

1:09:04.438 --> 1:09:06.207
But it's not the same.

1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:08.175
You actually had an
encounter with someone!

1:09:08.209 --> 1:09:12.045
Jesus said, "If you look
at a woman to lust after,

1:09:12.078 --> 1:09:15.048
then you've already committed
adultery in her heart".

1:09:15.082 --> 1:09:17.318
See, Ruth only kissed one man.

1:09:17.351 --> 1:09:21.255
How many women have you looked
at with the same intention?

1:09:21.288 --> 1:09:23.123
Ruth, you say you love Brandon.

1:09:23.157 --> 1:09:24.358
So I have to ask you again,

1:09:24.391 --> 1:09:28.295
do you have any feelings
for this colleague?

1:09:31.030 --> 1:09:32.266
I don't know what I feel.

1:09:32.299 --> 1:09:35.135
This is hard,
but this is good.

1:09:35.169 --> 1:09:38.938
Transparency is what we need
for your marriage to heal.

1:09:38.972 --> 1:09:40.241
Our time's almost up,

1:09:40.274 --> 1:09:42.409
but I want you guys to
both keep this in mind,

1:09:42.443 --> 1:09:44.511
marriage, as you both know,

1:09:44.545 --> 1:09:47.281
represents God's
relationship with us.

1:09:47.314 --> 1:09:50.049
I want you guys to both to
really think and consider

1:09:50.084 --> 1:09:52.018
everything that
God has given us,

1:09:52.051 --> 1:09:54.988
then I want you to think
about the communion exercise.

1:09:55.021 --> 1:09:56.557
"For I have received of the Lord

1:09:56.590 --> 1:09:58.559
that which also
I give unto you."

1:09:58.592 --> 1:10:03.930
You receive salvation, mercy,
grace, and forgiveness.

1:10:04.465 --> 1:10:05.999
We're gonna use this
scripture as a guide

1:10:06.032 --> 1:10:07.534
for our last sessions together.

1:10:07.568 --> 1:10:09.536
But in the interim,
I'm gonna recommend

1:10:09.570 --> 1:10:13.039
that you guys take a brief
separation from each other.

1:10:13.072 --> 1:10:15.309
And I'm also gonna ask
that, for the next session,

1:10:15.342 --> 1:10:17.344
it just be Brandon and myself.

1:10:17.378 --> 1:10:19.213
Can we agree to that?

1:10:20.581 --> 1:10:22.082
Good.

1:10:22.116 --> 1:10:23.217
See you then.

1:10:28.555 --> 1:10:29.523
I don't know what to do.

1:10:29.556 --> 1:10:31.057
I don't...

1:10:31.091 --> 1:10:32.393
I don't know what
else to say, God.

1:10:32.426 --> 1:10:33.294
I just...

1:10:41.602 --> 1:10:42.569
Just help us.

1:10:47.073 --> 1:10:48.975
Wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait.

1:10:49.008 --> 1:10:50.477
What are you saying?

1:10:50.511 --> 1:10:54.581
What I'm saying, is she
kept telling me, "Go slower".

1:10:54.615 --> 1:10:56.283
She's always doing that.

1:10:56.317 --> 1:10:57.418
She's so controlling.

1:10:57.451 --> 1:10:59.086
Tries to control everything.

1:10:59.119 --> 1:11:01.455
Yeah, and you said,
"You didn't care".

1:11:01.488 --> 1:11:02.423
I didn't say that.

1:11:02.456 --> 1:11:04.458
I said, "I couldn't stop".

1:11:04.491 --> 1:11:07.261
You said, "You kept going".

1:11:07.294 --> 1:11:08.629
And?

1:11:08.662 --> 1:11:10.230
You didn't stop.

1:11:10.264 --> 1:11:11.098
It was too late.

1:11:11.131 --> 1:11:12.633
I couldn't.

1:11:12.666 --> 1:11:15.302
What do you mean you couldn't?

1:11:15.336 --> 1:11:17.304
Think about it.

1:11:17.338 --> 1:11:20.574
So you
chose not to stop?

1:11:20.607 --> 1:11:22.443
What your point, man?

1:11:22.476 --> 1:11:26.347
How often do you
actually make love to Ruth?

1:11:30.584 --> 1:11:32.086
Well?

1:11:32.119 --> 1:11:34.355
This is so stupid!

1:11:34.388 --> 1:11:35.389
Oh, it is?

1:11:38.659 --> 1:11:40.260
She belongs to me.

1:11:40.294 --> 1:11:41.328
Her body belongs to me.

1:11:41.362 --> 1:11:45.232
Who are you to tell me what
to do with my wife in bed?

1:11:45.265 --> 1:11:47.401
Well, who else
does she belong to?

1:11:47.434 --> 1:11:49.370
Who do you belong to?

1:11:49.403 --> 1:11:50.604
Well, if I knew
the answer to that,

1:11:50.637 --> 1:11:52.473
we wouldn't be
here now, would we?

1:11:52.506 --> 1:11:56.075
And you'd be broke,
without a job.

1:11:56.110 --> 1:11:58.278
Man, I just can't believe
she would do this to me.

1:12:00.114 --> 1:12:02.483
After all the hard work,
after everything I've done!

1:12:02.516 --> 1:12:06.052
After all the sacrifices
I made for us!

1:12:06.086 --> 1:12:07.688
You keep askin'
the same question,

1:12:07.721 --> 1:12:09.156
"Why did she do this?",

1:12:09.189 --> 1:12:12.393
but have you ever
stopped to ask yourself,

1:12:12.426 --> 1:12:14.361
"Why did she stop?".

1:12:14.395 --> 1:12:16.697
Why didn't she just keep
going with this man?

1:12:16.730 --> 1:12:19.099
Why come home and tell you?

1:12:19.133 --> 1:12:21.101
Risk her reputation?

1:12:21.135 --> 1:12:22.703
Agree to sleep on the
couch indefinitely?

1:12:22.736 --> 1:12:27.574
And to top it all off, withstand
your incessant cynicism,

1:12:27.608 --> 1:12:30.210
demands, and constant criticism?

1:12:30.244 --> 1:12:32.546
Have you ever asked that?

1:12:32.579 --> 1:12:34.648
What the hell are
you telling me, man?

1:12:34.681 --> 1:12:36.450
She cheated on me.

1:12:36.483 --> 1:12:38.118
Just because she came to me,
after stickin' her tongue

1:12:38.152 --> 1:12:40.220
down another man's
throat I should be happy?

1:12:40.254 --> 1:12:43.357
Well, she stopped,
yet, you didn't.

1:12:44.358 --> 1:12:46.493
It's interesting.

1:12:46.527 --> 1:12:48.395
What do you mean?

1:12:48.429 --> 1:12:51.632
She stopped kissing this
other man because she loves you.

1:12:51.665 --> 1:12:53.567
You claim that
she's controlling.

1:12:53.600 --> 1:12:55.169
She is controlling.

1:12:55.202 --> 1:12:56.603
She tries to control everything.

1:12:56.637 --> 1:12:58.505
She controls the dishes.

1:12:58.539 --> 1:13:02.576
She's controlling about
the housework, about sex,

1:13:02.609 --> 1:13:04.745
about what I eat.

1:13:04.778 --> 1:13:06.380
It's driving me crazy!

1:13:06.413 --> 1:13:10.617
And you're not controlling
about anything ever?

1:13:10.651 --> 1:13:13.520
Are you saying
I don't love my wife?

1:13:13.554 --> 1:13:17.124
No, no, I'm not
saying that, Brandon.

1:13:17.157 --> 1:13:19.760
Look, Ruth was
unfaithful to you.

1:13:19.793 --> 1:13:22.596
She committed
infidelity, and for that,

1:13:22.629 --> 1:13:25.766
you have every right
to be upset, period.

1:13:25.799 --> 1:13:28.469
But I'm trying to get
you to see something.

1:13:28.502 --> 1:13:29.503
Just see it.

1:13:30.737 --> 1:13:33.373
When your wife
took her last kiss

1:13:33.407 --> 1:13:37.277
on the lips of this other
guy, she ran to you!

1:13:38.378 --> 1:13:40.781
She ran hoping that you would
embrace her in your arms,

1:13:40.814 --> 1:13:42.683
and what do you do afterwards?

1:13:42.716 --> 1:13:46.687
You force your will and
desire, and call that love.

1:13:46.720 --> 1:13:49.423
That's what I'm trying
to get you to see.

1:13:49.456 --> 1:13:51.792
Emotions might have caused her
to land into the wrong arms,

1:13:51.825 --> 1:13:56.363
but love caused her to
come back into your arms.

1:13:56.396 --> 1:13:58.699
Isn't Ruth worth fighting for?

1:13:58.732 --> 1:13:59.566
Yeah.

1:14:01.301 --> 1:14:06.306
You know, I was talking to her
father before we came to you,

1:14:07.307 --> 1:14:11.512
and he was saying to me,
when he gave Ruth away,

1:14:15.816 --> 1:14:18.785
that he's entrusting
her life to me.

1:14:20.354 --> 1:14:22.556
He's sick right now with cancer.

1:14:22.589 --> 1:14:25.726
He doesn't know if
he's gonna make it.

1:14:26.593 --> 1:14:30.597
And he's known for a while
now, he just hasn't told Ruth.

1:14:30.631 --> 1:14:31.698
I mean, I can't
control whether or not

1:14:31.732 --> 1:14:34.835
she takes her next breath,
but her life is in my hands.

1:14:34.868 --> 1:14:36.637
He gave her to me.

1:14:36.670 --> 1:14:38.338
God gave her to you.

1:14:38.372 --> 1:14:42.743
But she needs your compassion,
protection, and love.

1:14:42.776 --> 1:14:44.311
Take her back.

1:14:44.344 --> 1:14:45.812
Win her back.

1:14:45.846 --> 1:14:47.481
She belongs to you.

1:15:08.502 --> 1:15:09.369
Ruth?

1:15:11.371 --> 1:15:12.239
Ruth?

1:15:14.775 --> 1:15:16.510
You didn't answer me.

1:15:17.678 --> 1:15:18.879
Huh?

1:15:18.912 --> 1:15:22.516
I said, tell me
how did we get here?

1:15:22.549 --> 1:15:24.651
Honestly, I don't know.

1:15:25.786 --> 1:15:26.820
I don't know what
happened to me.

1:15:26.853 --> 1:15:30.757
When did you first realize
that something was wrong?

1:15:30.791 --> 1:15:33.627
When Brandon would touch me,

1:15:33.660 --> 1:15:37.798
it made me feel like I was
heavy and weighed down.

1:15:39.333 --> 1:15:42.269
His hands used to
make me feel like

1:15:43.704 --> 1:15:45.539
nothing could buckle me.

1:15:45.572 --> 1:15:48.442
Everything I needed
was in those hands.

1:15:48.475 --> 1:15:50.544
Then they stopped giving.

1:15:51.678 --> 1:15:53.413
They started taking.

1:15:54.414 --> 1:15:55.616
Stopped loving.

1:15:58.785 --> 1:16:00.754
And I stopped giving.

1:16:01.822 --> 1:16:03.357
I started taking.

1:16:05.826 --> 1:16:08.729
And with Jackson,
I stopped loving.

1:16:12.666 --> 1:16:14.868
What was it about Jackson that

1:16:14.901 --> 1:16:17.604
you wanted to take for yourself?

1:16:17.638 --> 1:16:21.575
The warmth and the love
that Brandon gave me,

1:16:22.709 --> 1:16:24.778
I found again in
the hands of this,

1:16:24.811 --> 1:16:27.781
in the cold hands of this man.

1:16:27.814 --> 1:16:30.684
Yes, I know you
have a lot going on,

1:16:30.717 --> 1:16:32.519
and it probably seems like

1:16:32.552 --> 1:16:35.422
there's not a whole
lotta support.

1:16:36.556 --> 1:16:39.326
You said your father
has cancer, right?

1:16:39.359 --> 1:16:40.761
Yes, stage four.

1:16:42.996 --> 1:16:44.898
Sorry to hear that.

1:16:44.931 --> 1:16:46.800
And you also said
your mother passed

1:16:46.833 --> 1:16:48.969
when you were an undergrad.

1:16:49.002 --> 1:16:52.539
Does her not being here
add to the weight you feel?

1:16:52.572 --> 1:16:54.574
Do you think about her?

1:16:54.608 --> 1:16:55.909
No more than most people do

1:16:55.942 --> 1:16:58.945
when they think about
their dead parents.

1:16:58.979 --> 1:17:00.480
You miss her?

1:17:15.996 --> 1:17:17.631
Ruth, come sit.

1:17:28.041 --> 1:17:29.943
It's gonna be okay.

1:18:00.540 --> 1:18:01.808
She's already.

1:18:03.477 --> 1:18:04.010
It's okay.

1:18:05.712 --> 1:18:06.880
Sorry.

1:18:06.913 --> 1:18:10.517
No!

1:18:10.550 --> 1:18:11.618
No!

1:18:11.651 --> 1:18:13.553
She was my best friend.

1:18:16.456 --> 1:18:18.458
But she took on
so much, you know?

1:18:18.492 --> 1:18:21.695
Upon herself that we didn't
even know that she was sick.

1:18:21.728 --> 1:18:23.997
And it seems like Brandon
is the same way with me.

1:18:24.030 --> 1:18:27.934
He didn't even notice that
I wasn't around him anymore.

1:18:27.968 --> 1:18:31.071
He didn't notice just how
heavy his hands were getting.

1:18:31.105 --> 1:18:32.506
And then Jackson was there,

1:18:32.539 --> 1:18:33.940
- and-
- Do you love him?

1:18:33.974 --> 1:18:35.008
Brandon?

1:18:36.943 --> 1:18:37.978
Yes, I do.

1:18:38.011 --> 1:18:39.679
Do you love Jackson?

1:18:39.713 --> 1:18:42.849
As much as I love his
hands, I can't say I love him.

1:18:42.883 --> 1:18:44.451
If you had a choice between

1:18:44.484 --> 1:18:47.088
Jackson's hands and
Brandon's heart,

1:18:47.121 --> 1:18:49.823
who would you choose?

1:18:49.856 --> 1:18:51.092
I don't know.

1:18:51.125 --> 1:18:54.528
That's a question
that you have to answer.

1:18:54.561 --> 1:18:59.466
That's a question that will
make or break your marriage.

1:19:02.736 --> 1:19:05.005
Cherise, because you know

1:19:05.038 --> 1:19:07.841
that is why the early
bird gets the worm.

1:19:07.874 --> 1:19:11.678
All right, can you get
me the Simpson affidavit.

1:19:11.711 --> 1:19:14.047
I wanna send over their
pre-trial motion tomorrow.

1:19:14.081 --> 1:19:15.482
All right.

1:19:15.515 --> 1:19:19.319
Thank you.

1:19:33.033 --> 1:19:34.034
Mr. Stewart.

1:19:36.670 --> 1:19:38.872
To what do I owe the pleasure?

1:19:38.905 --> 1:19:40.707
Nice office, Black.

1:19:42.109 --> 1:19:43.877
How'd you end up in here?

1:19:43.910 --> 1:19:47.948
Well, Ruth secured this
for me before I got here.

1:19:47.981 --> 1:19:48.982
It is great.

1:19:50.684 --> 1:19:53.120
How did you get in here?

1:19:54.054 --> 1:19:57.091
You ask too many questions.

1:19:57.124 --> 1:20:00.827
You and Ruth are like
two peas in a pod.

1:20:00.861 --> 1:20:02.662
You seem fond of her.

1:20:02.696 --> 1:20:04.098
Well, she's great.

1:20:06.167 --> 1:20:08.135
She's a wonderful woman.

1:20:08.169 --> 1:20:09.703
You're a very lucky man,

1:20:09.736 --> 1:20:12.372
but, of course, you know that.

1:20:12.973 --> 1:20:16.576
Black, I'm a cut
right to the chase.

1:20:16.610 --> 1:20:19.146
I know what happened
between you and my wife.

1:20:19.180 --> 1:20:20.614
Look,

1:20:20.647 --> 1:20:23.850
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1:20:25.685 --> 1:20:28.688
Man, don't test
my patience today.

1:20:31.925 --> 1:20:34.928
Man, you don't
know what you have.

1:20:38.064 --> 1:20:43.403
Ruth is gorgeous, skillful,
brilliant, and incredibly sexy.

1:20:46.840 --> 1:20:50.710
She's kind, loving,
generous to everyone here,

1:20:55.015 --> 1:20:56.983
but you don't even care.

1:21:02.123 --> 1:21:07.128
What kind of man can't go
with his wife to the hospital?

1:21:07.560 --> 1:21:09.029
Oh, yeah, she told me.

1:21:11.165 --> 1:21:12.899
So yeah, I know Ruth.

1:21:15.869 --> 1:21:19.206
I may know Ruth more
than you even know.

1:21:19.240 --> 1:21:22.943
Hell, if her lips
were a preview,

1:21:22.976 --> 1:21:25.212
I'd give my left nut
to be her husband -

1:21:26.913 --> 1:21:28.115
Please, do it.

1:21:28.149 --> 1:21:29.816
I dare you.

1:21:29.849 --> 1:21:31.252
I'll knock your teeth out.

1:21:31.285 --> 1:21:33.954
Now, you listen to me,
and you listen to me good.

1:21:33.987 --> 1:21:36.090
Stay the hell away from my wife!

1:21:36.123 --> 1:21:39.659
You come near her again, and
I will personally kill you.

1:21:39.693 --> 1:21:40.927
What,

1:21:40.961 --> 1:21:42.629
you threatening me?

1:21:43.297 --> 1:21:45.031
You don't know me!

1:21:48.068 --> 1:21:49.669
Damn right I am.

1:21:50.670 --> 1:21:53.907
And believe me, I've had seven
clients in the past 10 years

1:21:53.940 --> 1:21:55.209
who've committed murder,

1:21:55.242 --> 1:21:59.012
all of which walked
away Scott free.

1:21:59.045 --> 1:22:01.014
I will get away with it.

1:22:01.047 --> 1:22:03.016
I'm sure you know that.

1:22:03.049 --> 1:22:06.953
And if you even think about
smearing my wife's name,

1:22:06.987 --> 1:22:08.688
or ruining her reputation,

1:22:08.722 --> 1:22:11.925
all I have to do is
make one call, one,

1:22:13.227 --> 1:22:16.896
to ruin your career
for the next 20 years.

1:22:18.798 --> 1:22:19.866
Are we clear?

1:22:29.143 --> 1:22:31.178
I know you, Black.

1:22:31.212 --> 1:22:32.912
I know all about you.

1:22:32.946 --> 1:22:35.182
How you graduated
with a 2.5 GPA,

1:22:35.216 --> 1:22:38.051
yet, have unexplainable success,

1:22:38.085 --> 1:22:40.020
going from office to office,

1:22:40.053 --> 1:22:42.323
telling every lie
you could think of,

1:22:42.356 --> 1:22:46.127
and inch by inch, as you slide
under your boss' dresses,

1:22:46.160 --> 1:22:48.195
you climb the corporate ladder.

1:22:48.229 --> 1:22:52.199
Ruining families, breaking
hearts, adding to your list.

1:22:52.233 --> 1:22:56.237
And when these
scandals risk exposure,

1:22:56.270 --> 1:23:01.275
they throw you somewhere else
with high recommendations.

1:23:01.708 --> 1:23:03.310
Yeah, I know you, Black.

1:23:06.347 --> 1:23:08.948
I know you real good.

1:23:13.820 --> 1:23:16.823
Give your two weeks
notice by Friday.

1:23:20.227 --> 1:23:22.296
Well, alas, here we are.

1:23:22.329 --> 1:23:24.064
Six weeks gone.

1:23:24.098 --> 1:23:26.966
Our last session together.

1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:28.968
Ruth, are you all right?

1:23:29.002 --> 1:23:30.204
Yes, I'm fine.

1:23:30.237 --> 1:23:32.005
My brother cooked
for us last night,

1:23:32.038 --> 1:23:34.040
but it all came up this morning.

1:23:34.074 --> 1:23:35.142
But I'm okay.

1:23:36.076 --> 1:23:39.979
Before we get into interactions,
I wanna ask you both

1:23:40.013 --> 1:23:42.982
what your experience was
like being separated.

1:23:43.016 --> 1:23:44.385
Ruth, let's start with you.

1:23:44.418 --> 1:23:48.155
You know, the Lord
really showed me that

1:23:48.189 --> 1:23:51.392
I rely too much on people
to help and support me,

1:23:51.425 --> 1:23:53.793
and, of course, it's
always good to get

1:23:53.827 --> 1:23:55.129
encouragement and support,

1:23:55.162 --> 1:23:56.596
but with Jackson,

1:24:01.435 --> 1:24:05.004
I wanted him to
make me feel valid.

1:24:05.038 --> 1:24:07.774
In that moment, he gave me that.

1:24:10.810 --> 1:24:15.316
And I felt so confused
about how I felt about him.

1:24:15.349 --> 1:24:18.852
I would start to have
feelings for him.

1:24:21.955 --> 1:24:25.792
When I saw him coming,
my heart would race.

1:24:25.825 --> 1:24:27.827
I would dream about him.

1:24:31.198 --> 1:24:32.299
But then I realized,

1:24:32.333 --> 1:24:37.238
that only God can love me in
such a way where I feel valued.

1:24:39.273 --> 1:24:42.443
Just being in his
presence made me realize

1:24:42.476 --> 1:24:45.112
just how much I love Brandon.

1:24:49.316 --> 1:24:50.184
Wow.

1:24:51.352 --> 1:24:53.354
Brandon, what about you?

1:24:56.157 --> 1:24:58.658
Well, I have a confession.

1:24:59.493 --> 1:25:00.994
Go ahead.

1:25:01.027 --> 1:25:04.165
I've never felt
good enough for you.

1:25:04.198 --> 1:25:05.266
No, it's not that I don't care.

1:25:05.299 --> 1:25:10.837
I just don't know how to make
myself feel enough for you.

1:25:11.372 --> 1:25:13.240
That's why all I can do is work.

1:25:13.274 --> 1:25:15.041
That's something
I know I can do.

1:25:15.074 --> 1:25:16.410
I can provide for you,

1:25:16.443 --> 1:25:18.479
but I can't give you
what you really need.

1:25:18.512 --> 1:25:20.381
It hurts, because I...

1:25:24.518 --> 1:25:25.386
I can't...

1:25:32.126 --> 1:25:35.262
So I work, and I
work to prove to you,

1:25:36.397 --> 1:25:39.233
to prove to myself,
that I'm a man.

1:25:39.266 --> 1:25:42.936
I am a man, and I can
do something for you.

1:25:47.141 --> 1:25:50.076
But it seems like
every case I win,

1:25:52.146 --> 1:25:55.282
I forget about the
most important one,

1:25:58.152 --> 1:25:59.353
and that's you.

1:26:00.920 --> 1:26:03.457
Baby, you are
all I ever wanted.

1:26:05.159 --> 1:26:07.294
You are all I ever needed.

1:26:08.362 --> 1:26:10.431
I needed you to be there.

1:26:12.932 --> 1:26:15.135
I have another confession.

1:26:15.169 --> 1:26:16.470
Okay.

1:26:24.043 --> 1:26:28.449
It's not because of you
that we can't have children.

1:26:30.484 --> 1:26:33.320
I went to the doctor by myself,

1:26:34.954 --> 1:26:38.292
and they determined
that my count is low.

1:26:39.993 --> 1:26:42.129
Something's wrong with me,

1:26:43.497 --> 1:26:46.166
and I've known for so long,
but I didn't say anything,

1:26:46.200 --> 1:26:50.504
because I know, I already
know I didn't deserve you,

1:26:53.507 --> 1:26:55.008
but I did everything.

1:26:55.041 --> 1:26:58.011
I felt like I did
everything for you.

1:27:02.249 --> 1:27:04.218
Why would you go
to someone else?

1:27:04.251 --> 1:27:08.455
I'd never thought in a
million years that I would.

1:27:08.489 --> 1:27:10.190
So much stuff began to happen,

1:27:10.224 --> 1:27:13.460
and that's why I needed you
there with me by my side,

1:27:13.494 --> 1:27:15.562
but you were never there.

1:27:17.997 --> 1:27:20.800
But now I understand
what happened.

1:27:22.169 --> 1:27:25.372
You turned into a
completely different person.

1:27:25.406 --> 1:27:29.176
You went cold
just like that.

1:27:29.209 --> 1:27:31.445
And for what, baby?

1:27:31.478 --> 1:27:33.980
Because of a low sperm count?

1:27:35.014 --> 1:27:36.617
Why wouldn't you tell me this?

1:27:36.650 --> 1:27:38.152
I don't know.

1:27:38.185 --> 1:27:41.588
And you didn't even
notice that I was gone,

1:27:43.123 --> 1:27:45.559
and that hurt me so bad,

1:27:45.592 --> 1:27:48.061
that you could see me
day in and day out,

1:27:48.095 --> 1:27:51.998
and not know that your
own wife was gone.

1:27:52.031 --> 1:27:55.469
You won your cases,
you made partner,

1:27:55.502 --> 1:27:57.571
but a part of you was dead,

1:27:58.672 --> 1:28:02.242
and you didn't
even seem to care.

1:28:02.276 --> 1:28:05.011
But I'm a good man, Ruth.

1:28:05.044 --> 1:28:06.280
I'm a good man.

1:28:07.448 --> 1:28:11.618
I've done everything
I know to do for you.

1:28:11.652 --> 1:28:14.221
Some of these men out here
who call themselves married

1:28:14.254 --> 1:28:17.124
would never do these
things for their wives.

1:28:17.157 --> 1:28:20.627
I'm working, coming home,
and attending to you.

1:28:20.661 --> 1:28:22.162
I'm not sleepin' around.

1:28:22.196 --> 1:28:23.564
I don't have babies all
around the neighborhood

1:28:23.597 --> 1:28:25.632
- with different women.
- Yes.

1:28:25.666 --> 1:28:27.201
I'm a good man.

1:28:27.234 --> 1:28:28.402
I'm just not good
enough for you.

1:28:28.435 --> 1:28:31.271
Okay, what do you
want me to say, honey?

1:28:31.305 --> 1:28:32.339
I know it.

1:28:32.373 --> 1:28:34.241
- Yes, you are a good man.
- What do I want you to say?

1:28:34.274 --> 1:28:36.243
How 'bout sorry for
ruining my life?

1:28:36.276 --> 1:28:37.277
How 'bout sorry
for embarrassing me

1:28:37.311 --> 1:28:39.613
- in front of your family?
- I said that I was sorry!

1:28:39.646 --> 1:28:41.248
I've said I'm sorry
a million times,

1:28:41.281 --> 1:28:42.549
but it doesn't seem
to be enough for you!

1:28:42.583 --> 1:28:44.685
Nothing I do is
good enough for you!

1:28:44.718 --> 1:28:46.520
What the hell else
do you want me to do?

1:28:46.553 --> 1:28:48.288
Just stop.

1:28:48.322 --> 1:28:50.890
Everybody take a deep breath.

1:28:53.427 --> 1:28:55.129
Our time is almost over.

1:28:55.162 --> 1:28:59.533
I know you two care for each
other, but let me just say,

1:28:59.566 --> 1:29:04.338
love is a choice, and choice
is a very powerful thing.

1:29:05.272 --> 1:29:08.609
Jesus' prayer for his disciples
was that they would be one,

1:29:08.642 --> 1:29:10.711
just as he and the
Father are one,

1:29:10.744 --> 1:29:12.346
and that is my prayer for you,

1:29:12.379 --> 1:29:14.381
even as we end
our sessions here,

1:29:14.415 --> 1:29:17.651
that you two would be
one, but it's a choice.

1:29:17.684 --> 1:29:19.219
It's your choice.

1:29:20.019 --> 1:29:22.423
Will you choose to fully
embrace this principle,

1:29:22.456 --> 1:29:24.191
and apply it to
your walk together

1:29:24.224 --> 1:29:27.628
the way God intends you
to, or will you not?

1:29:31.565 --> 1:29:33.434
Look, I rarely do this.

1:29:47.514 --> 1:29:49.383
These are divorce papers.

1:29:49.416 --> 1:29:50.317
I'm giving these to you,

1:29:50.350 --> 1:29:55.355
and you two will decide
what you're going to do.

1:29:55.389 --> 1:29:58.492
I just have one last
request for you both.

1:29:58.525 --> 1:30:02.496
That you two go to the
beginning of your relationship.

1:30:02.529 --> 1:30:04.565
Go to the place where
you had your first date,

1:30:04.598 --> 1:30:06.333
and there, decide whether or not

1:30:06.366 --> 1:30:08.402
you wanna continue
this marriage.

1:30:08.435 --> 1:30:10.504
Can we agree to that?

1:30:10.537 --> 1:30:12.439
I will agree to that.

1:30:12.473 --> 1:30:13.407
When?

1:30:14.675 --> 1:30:16.743
Whatever works for you.

1:30:18.312 --> 1:30:19.246
Saturday.

1:30:20.547 --> 1:30:22.516
You know the time.

1:30:22.549 --> 1:30:23.417
Fine.

1:30:24.384 --> 1:30:26.520
Excellent.

1:30:26.553 --> 1:30:28.255
A pleasure meeting you both.

1:30:28.288 --> 1:30:31.758
I wish you well, and
I'll be praying for you.

1:30:34.761 --> 1:30:37.364
So Briar's Park, Saturday?

1:30:44.371 --> 1:30:45.239
Yeah.

1:31:29.750 --> 1:31:32.786
Thank you for
all your blessing.

1:31:35.822 --> 1:31:38.258
You have been so good to me.

1:31:42.262 --> 1:31:43.764
She betrayed me, God.

1:31:46.900 --> 1:31:48.869
How am I supposed to...

1:31:59.413 --> 1:32:00.881
I need you to speak.

1:32:00.914 --> 1:32:04.384
I need you to say
something to me now.

1:32:08.722 --> 1:32:09.656
I love her.

1:33:54.861 --> 1:33:55.729
I do.

1:33:56.897 --> 1:33:57.931
I do.

1:34:02.035 --> 1:34:03.704
With this ring.

1:34:08.008 --> 1:34:09.509
With this ring.

1:36:30.550 --> 1:36:31.818
I'm so scared.

1:36:37.557 --> 1:36:40.060
I'll be right there with you.

1:36:43.797 --> 1:36:44.965
I don't want a divorce.

1:36:49.803 --> 1:36:50.804
Me either.

1:36:54.108 --> 1:36:55.909
"It's not an option",

1:36:56.710 --> 1:36:59.846
that's what you said when
we first got engaged.

1:36:59.880 --> 1:37:02.549
We're in this thing together.

1:37:04.218 --> 1:37:06.087
Like Ossie and Ruby.

1:37:15.829 --> 1:37:17.564
I'm sorry, baby.

1:37:23.237 --> 1:37:24.171
I love you.

1:37:27.607 --> 1:37:28.541
Me too.

1:37:30.610 --> 1:37:34.115
You see, you were always
everything I needed.

1:37:38.852 --> 1:37:40.187
Thank you, Jesus.

1:38:22.996 --> 1:38:25.099
That what
God has joined together

1:38:25.999 --> 1:38:28.001
let no man put us under.
