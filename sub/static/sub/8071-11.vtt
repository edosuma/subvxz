[theme music]

00:08.442 --> 00:09.243
OK, OK.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.378
My turn.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.513
And I've got coupons.

00:12.613 --> 00:15.015
Woo-hoo.

00:15.116 --> 00:17.585
Now, you know these paper
towels are on sale, there.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.087
Yep, two for eighty-nine.

00:19.187 --> 00:20.388
Ooh, she's good.

00:25.259 --> 00:26.127
What's this?

00:26.227 --> 00:28.362
Grapes.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.030
No, this is three grapes.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.865
How am I supposed to
charge you for this?

00:31.965 --> 00:35.269
Well, I ate about
seven or eight of them.

00:35.369 --> 00:38.306
And I believe I
also had four grapes.

00:38.406 --> 00:41.909
So charge me for,
what, 10, 11, 15 grapes.

00:42.009 --> 00:43.043
We don't charge by the grape.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.312
We charge by the pound.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.147
Well, I know what I weighed
before I ate the grapes,

00:46.247 --> 00:47.748
so why don't I climb
up here on the scale,

00:47.848 --> 00:49.483
and then you can just--

00:49.583 --> 00:50.718
Mom, stop it, OK?

00:50.818 --> 00:52.353
There are people
waiting in line!

00:52.453 --> 00:53.254
Becky?

00:59.560 --> 01:00.661
What's the problem here?

01:00.761 --> 01:02.196
Nothing, Howard.
Everything's fine.

01:02.296 --> 01:04.198
Yeah, well you've got a line
full of customers and a belt

01:04.298 --> 01:05.566
that's not move.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.868
Make it move.

01:07.968 --> 01:09.470
OK, I'm sorry.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.004
Hey, Becky.

01:11.105 --> 01:13.207
If this job's too much for
you, I can get somebody

01:13.307 --> 01:15.008
competent to take over.

01:15.109 --> 01:16.577
Howard, the longer
you stand here

01:16.677 --> 01:18.579
and insult me, the longer
it's going to take for me

01:18.679 --> 01:20.648
to check these people through.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.916
So, if you go back to your
little manager cage over there,

01:23.016 --> 01:24.985
we can both get our work done.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.421
That's a keeper.

[music playing]

02:15.669 --> 02:16.537
No, Mother.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.206
You've done the
exactly right thing.

02:18.306 --> 02:20.874
I've been telling you to
do that the whole time.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.943
Well, you should've
kicked his sorry butt out

02:23.043 --> 02:25.012
before Thanksgiving.

02:25.112 --> 02:26.747
I know he's my father, but jeez.

02:26.847 --> 02:31.585
He's like every other
man, a lying sack of dirt.

02:31.685 --> 02:34.054
Oh no, you'll be fine.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.456
What did he ever do for you?

02:35.556 --> 02:38.025
He knocked you up twice and took
the garbage out on Thursdays.

02:38.125 --> 02:40.628
What, are we going
to erect a statue?

02:40.728 --> 02:42.596
No, I am not going
to talk to him.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.232
That man is a
giant pile of crap.

02:47.668 --> 02:48.969
No, I'm not yelling.

02:49.069 --> 02:51.372
I'm just saying that you
did the right thing, OK?

02:51.472 --> 02:53.774
Yes, you did!

02:53.874 --> 02:55.909
So what if you've got
adjacent burial plots?

02:56.009 --> 02:58.111
That's no reason to stay
married to somebody!

03:01.215 --> 03:03.317
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:03.417 --> 03:04.418
I love you too.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.388
OK, well call me if
you need anything.

03:07.488 --> 03:08.722
All right, bye.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.391
Boy, what a day I had.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.159
You know, my
father's little affair

03:12.260 --> 03:13.894
with this woman in
Kansas City, it's

03:13.994 --> 03:15.796
been going on for twenty years!

03:15.896 --> 03:17.431
Not two, twenty!

03:17.531 --> 03:18.332
Whoa.

03:18.432 --> 03:19.800
Did your mom throw him out?

03:19.900 --> 03:21.068
Well, of course
she through him out.

03:21.168 --> 03:24.037
She doesn't have the strength
to drive some ice pick

03:24.137 --> 03:26.106
through his skull and then
drag his lifeless body

03:26.206 --> 03:27.308
to some shallow grave.

03:30.478 --> 03:32.846
Sounds like you've
thought this through, dear.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.248
Well, I like to think ahead.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.720
How come the kids
ain't eating with us?

03:39.820 --> 03:42.323
Well, Becky's still at
work, and DJ's eating over

03:42.423 --> 03:44.525
at Todd's house, in
Darlene's up in her room

03:44.625 --> 03:47.928
sacrificing a
chicken or whatever.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.863
Macaroni and cheese!

03:49.963 --> 03:52.400
Together again.

03:52.500 --> 03:53.767
Your phone's been
busy for an hour.

03:53.867 --> 03:54.668
Yeah.

03:54.768 --> 03:55.769
I've been on there with Mom.

03:55.869 --> 03:56.737
Yeah?

03:56.837 --> 03:58.906
How's she doing?

03:59.006 --> 04:00.841
Well, there won't be
a bottle of chardonnay

04:00.941 --> 04:04.345
left in Moline by morning.

04:04.445 --> 04:06.380
What do you guys
got going tonight?

04:06.480 --> 04:09.783
Well, we're going to sit
in here until dinner is over,

04:09.883 --> 04:11.218
and then we're going
to go sit in there.

04:19.226 --> 04:21.962
Well, I had an
overnight haul to Topeka,

04:22.062 --> 04:24.665
and I was going to stop
through Kansas City on my way

04:24.765 --> 04:26.534
back and check out
Dad's mistress.

04:26.634 --> 04:27.801
What am I thinking, huh?

04:31.071 --> 04:31.939
I don't believe you.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.240
Yeah.

04:33.341 --> 04:34.708
He told me her name, so I
looked it up in information

04:34.808 --> 04:35.843
and I got her address.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.077
It's totally insane.

04:37.177 --> 04:37.978
Are you coming?

04:40.714 --> 04:43.451
Why would I want to do that?

04:43.551 --> 04:44.818
Well, Dad's been
having an affair

04:44.918 --> 04:46.387
with this woman for 20 years.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.121
I want to see what she
looks like, don't you?

04:48.221 --> 04:50.123
What would we even
say to this woman?

04:50.223 --> 04:51.258
I don't know.

04:51.359 --> 04:54.395
We can figure that out
on the way down there!

04:54.495 --> 04:56.864
No way!

04:56.964 --> 04:58.866
OK.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.534
This little trip's going
to make a great story,

05:00.634 --> 05:06.474
and you're just going to be the
big wuss at the very beginning,

05:06.574 --> 05:09.276
- I'm not going.
- OK, fine.

05:09.377 --> 05:13.213
All right, I'll see
you tomorrow night.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.648
Do you-- do you believe her?

05:14.748 --> 05:16.984
She has no business
going to see this woman.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.353
Driving all the way to
Kansas City for what?

05:19.453 --> 05:22.523
They make great barbecue
sauce in Kansas City.

05:22.623 --> 05:25.426
I'll bring you back some.

da-da-da, road again, da-da-da.

05:41.809 --> 05:43.310
Hey, sing with me, Jackie.

05:43.411 --> 05:47.481
No, I don't know
"Da-Da-Da-Da Road Again."

05:47.581 --> 05:48.882
What's this button for?

05:48.982 --> 05:50.217
Don't touch that!

05:50.317 --> 05:51.752
Just stop distracting me.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.221
I'm operating a
20-ton vehicle at well

05:54.321 --> 05:56.490
past the legal speed limit.

05:56.590 --> 05:57.791
OK.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.159
Can I drive?

05:59.259 --> 06:00.160
No!

06:00.260 --> 06:02.195
Jeez, you beg me
to come with you,

06:02.295 --> 06:03.464
and now you're just
all mean to me.

06:03.564 --> 06:04.965
Did not!
Am not!

06:05.065 --> 06:06.199
Did too.

06:06.299 --> 06:07.234
Are too.

06:07.334 --> 06:09.403
Just 'cause I called
Dad a lying scum.

06:09.503 --> 06:12.339
Well, everything is just
so black and white to you,

06:12.440 --> 06:13.674
Roseanne, isn't it?

06:13.774 --> 06:15.509
Did you ever consider the
fact that Mom drove him to it?

06:15.609 --> 06:16.877
She drove him crazy.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.078
She made him nuts.

06:18.178 --> 06:19.413
Oh!

06:19.513 --> 06:21.449
She drove me crazy, too, but
I didn't have some other Mom

06:21.549 --> 06:22.616
stashed on the side.

06:25.453 --> 06:27.821
What are we going to even
say to this Joan woman?

06:27.921 --> 06:29.990
We are going to ask
her what kind of woman

06:30.090 --> 06:33.927
would steal a man away
from his happy family,

06:34.027 --> 06:35.796
Where were you living?

06:35.896 --> 06:39.066
We were never happy.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.801
Well, maybe we
would have been if she

06:40.901 --> 06:43.136
would have left Dad alone.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.474
Oh, now you're being unfair,
Jackie, because what woman

06:46.574 --> 06:49.076
could rightly turned
down a patio furniture

06:49.176 --> 06:52.012
salesman who cleaned out
his ears with his car keys.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.250
You just don't get it, do you?

06:57.350 --> 06:59.019
Yeah, I do get it.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.854
First it's Mom's
fault, then it's

07:00.954 --> 07:03.457
this woman's fault.
Well, when is it going

07:03.557 --> 07:05.593
to be Dad's fault, Jackie?

07:05.693 --> 07:09.362
You know there's a word for
this, and it's called denial.

07:09.463 --> 07:11.431
Look, I don't want
to talk about it, OK?

07:11.532 --> 07:12.700
Well, you started it.

07:12.800 --> 07:13.567
Well, I'm stopping it.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.102
OK.

07:15.202 --> 07:16.870
OK.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.739
You want to play I-spy again?

07:18.839 --> 07:20.641
No.

07:20.741 --> 07:21.909
License plate poker?

07:22.009 --> 07:23.911
No.

07:24.011 --> 07:24.812
OK.

07:24.912 --> 07:25.779
Knock-knock.

07:25.879 --> 07:26.714
No, come on, Roseanne.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.081
Come on!
Knock-knock.

07:28.181 --> 07:29.249
Who's there?

07:29.349 --> 07:30.350
Cleopatra.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.552
Cleopatra who?

07:31.652 --> 07:33.787
Cleopatra, queen of denial.

07:36.557 --> 07:37.357
Shut up.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.129
Oh!

07:42.229 --> 07:43.063
Oh!

07:43.163 --> 07:44.164
Look, a Volkswagen!

07:44.264 --> 07:45.065
Slug bug!

07:45.165 --> 07:45.999
Oh!

07:46.099 --> 07:47.400
Don't!

07:47.501 --> 07:49.369
Come on, how old are you?

07:49.469 --> 07:50.470
Grow up.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.906
It's not like we're
nine years old anymore.

07:53.006 --> 07:53.807
Cadillac whack!

07:53.907 --> 07:56.777
Ah!

07:56.877 --> 07:57.745
Ow!

07:57.845 --> 07:59.212
I didn't hit you that hard!

07:59.312 --> 08:00.781
I'm paying you
back for that trip

08:00.881 --> 08:03.584
to Gettysburg we took
together when we were little.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.519
God, that was the
first trip ever.

08:05.619 --> 08:06.520
I know!

08:06.620 --> 08:08.221
I know!

08:08.321 --> 08:10.057
Every car that passed us
all the way down there,

08:10.157 --> 08:12.292
you beat the crap out of me!

08:12.392 --> 08:14.762
Eight hundred miles
in a station wagon.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.764
Yeah, just so Dad
could go see a bunch

08:16.864 --> 08:18.899
of cannonballs in a pile.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.068
Mom told us there
were going to be rides!

08:21.168 --> 08:22.469
Oh, they were such liars.

08:22.570 --> 08:23.837
Well, the trip back
was good, though.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.138
- Yeah.
- Right?

08:25.238 --> 08:26.907
Yeah, we were making all
that noise until Dad started

08:27.007 --> 08:31.244
screaming, not another word!

08:31.344 --> 08:33.714
So then we started making
all those animal noises.

08:33.814 --> 08:34.715
I know.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.650
[animal noises]

08:37.818 --> 08:39.987
Dad's yelling at us,
Mom's yelling at us.

08:40.087 --> 08:43.223
And you know, the whole time
I think neither one of them

08:43.323 --> 08:45.693
said a word to each other.

08:45.793 --> 08:48.028
Yeah, I don't think they
ever said a word to each other

08:48.128 --> 08:50.798
unless it was about us kids
fighting and get in trouble.

08:50.898 --> 08:51.699
Right.

08:51.799 --> 08:53.266
Which we did a lot.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.167
Yeah.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.202
I think we had to.

08:55.302 --> 08:56.369
We were trying to
save their marriage.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.542
Dodge.

09:02.643 --> 09:03.677
Dodge what?

09:03.777 --> 09:04.578
Dodge this.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.250
[music playing]

09:13.721 --> 09:15.122
God, I hate my life!

09:15.222 --> 09:16.023
Tough day, honey?

09:16.123 --> 09:18.425
Well, my job sucks.

09:18.525 --> 09:20.327
My boss is a big dumb jerk.

09:20.427 --> 09:22.229
Oh, that's too bad, dear.

09:22.329 --> 09:23.463
And I can't quit
because there's

09:23.563 --> 09:25.733
never any money around
here for anything I want.

09:25.833 --> 09:28.535
Sorry, sweetheart.

09:28.636 --> 09:32.239
And if you expect me to clean
up this rat hole, you're nuts.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.307
I'm taking a bath
and going to bed.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.208
Night, Rosie.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.347
Hey, Dad!

09:40.447 --> 09:42.015
Hey, Deej.

09:42.115 --> 09:44.517
How was dinner over
at Todd's house.

09:44.618 --> 09:45.518
It was great!

09:45.619 --> 09:47.688
They had cloth napkins
and everything.

09:47.788 --> 09:48.722
No way.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.123
Yeah, you want one?

09:53.994 --> 09:55.462
Deej, you can't do that.

09:55.562 --> 09:58.065
Uh-huh, Mrs.
Bowman gave it to me!

09:58.165 --> 09:59.032
She did not.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.801
Uh-huh, after I
blew my nose on it.

10:00.901 --> 10:04.004
She said to keep it!

10:04.104 --> 10:05.639
Way to go, Deej.

10:05.739 --> 10:06.874
Next time you're
over at their house,

10:06.974 --> 10:08.842
try to aim for their
big screen TV set.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.446
What brings you down here?

10:13.546 --> 10:15.315
You finally get that wooden
stake out of your heart?

10:15.415 --> 10:17.117
Becky's upstairs
crying her eyes out

10:17.217 --> 10:18.618
and I don't want to
be around for it.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.120
What's wrong?

10:20.220 --> 10:21.421
I promised I wouldn't tell.

10:21.521 --> 10:22.690
You lied.

10:22.790 --> 10:24.191
OK.

10:24.291 --> 10:27.427
Well, she stood up to her boss,
and he busted her down to bag

10:27.527 --> 10:32.700
girl and called her a bad word.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.902
How bad a word?

10:35.002 --> 10:36.403
Bad.

10:36.503 --> 10:37.938
The b-word?

10:38.038 --> 10:39.006
Worse.

10:39.106 --> 10:39.907
The f-word?

10:40.007 --> 10:41.809
Deej.

10:41.909 --> 10:44.477
The l-word?

10:44.577 --> 10:45.879
What's the l-word?

10:45.979 --> 10:48.348
I don't know.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.417
What's the f-word?

10:50.517 --> 10:51.318
DJ.

10:54.521 --> 10:55.322
All right, Darlene.

10:55.422 --> 10:56.223
What word?

11:00.193 --> 11:01.261
I'll kill him.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.363
Dad, you're not supposed
to know about this.

11:03.463 --> 11:04.965
Hey, accidents happen.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.366
I mean, like a big
can of creamed corn

11:06.466 --> 11:09.369
could fall on his head as
many times as it takes.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.218
That's enough, move over.

11:28.021 --> 11:28.989
Brought you a donut.

11:29.089 --> 11:29.957
Oh.

11:30.057 --> 11:31.792
How was the bathrooms in there?

11:31.892 --> 11:35.062
OK, if you breathe
through your mouth.

11:35.162 --> 11:38.966
I think I'll wait
'til Kansas City.

11:39.066 --> 11:40.768
Aren't you going
to have nothing?

11:40.868 --> 11:43.804
No, I think I'm going to try
and get a couple hours sleep.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.973
We made good time and
there's no need to press it.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.040
Oh, that's a good idea.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.408
I want to get some sleep too.
- OK.

11:48.508 --> 11:49.309
You sleep up here.

11:49.409 --> 11:50.443
No!

11:50.543 --> 11:54.547
Oh I can't sleep sitting
up unless I'm at work.

11:54.647 --> 11:56.083
There's not enough
room back here, Roseanne.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.018
ROSEANNE: There is so, Jackie.

11:58.118 --> 11:59.386
There's plenty of room.
Come on.

11:59.486 --> 12:00.287
Mm-mm.

12:02.890 --> 12:03.656
Move!

Ow!

Oh, come on.

Oh!

Come on!

I feel like I'm eight years
old and bunk bed collapsed.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.903
OK, scoot down, now.
Scoot down there.

Scoot down.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.039
Scoot down more.

12:19.139 --> 12:20.407

Is it OK for you?

No!

I'm sorry I've been
such a grump all day.

13:06.019 --> 13:06.887
That's OK.

13:06.987 --> 13:10.323
It's just that,
you know, I do think

13:10.423 --> 13:15.528
that it is kind of Dad's fault.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.098
Well, welcome back, Jackie.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.633
He and I were just so close,
and now I just don't feel

13:20.733 --> 13:21.969
like I can trust him, you know.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.737
That's what really stinks.

13:24.838 --> 13:28.208
What I can't understand is
how Mom didn't know any of this

was going on for like 20 years.

13:31.178 --> 13:33.646

can hear me unwrapping a Hershey

bar up in my bedroom closet.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.218
Well, he had a great cover.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.319
He was a traveling salesman.

13:39.419 --> 13:42.189
He was on the road all the time.

his hunting trips.

Fishing trips.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.127
Conventions.

13:47.227 --> 13:52.632
Roseanne, Dad could have
kids with this woman.

13:52.732 --> 13:57.170
They would be like
Darlene's age.

13:57.270 --> 14:01.374
Oh, man, that would
serve him right.

Hey, actually it's your problem.

14:20.928 --> 14:22.329
I'm Becky Conner's father.

14:22.429 --> 14:23.230
Oh, no.

14:23.330 --> 14:24.998
Look.

14:25.098 --> 14:27.234
If you've got to demote some
kid for not doing their job

14:27.334 --> 14:29.937
or fire him for mouthing
off, I can understand that.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.738
But nobody talks to my
daughter the way you did.

14:31.838 --> 14:33.740
Have you got that?

14:33.840 --> 14:35.608
Yes.

You going to hit me, too?

No.

14:43.850 --> 14:45.585
Look.

14:45.685 --> 14:48.255
I already promised him that I'd
apologize to Becky the minute

14:48.355 --> 14:51.124

making her cashier again,

people want from me?

What's the hell's going on here?

Mr. Conner, everything
is under control.

You can go home now.

15:06.606 --> 15:07.975
I don't want to go home.

15:08.075 --> 15:10.577
Did you hit that guy?

15:10.677 --> 15:11.611
Damn right I did.

15:11.711 --> 15:13.713
What gives you the
right to do that?

15:13.813 --> 15:15.315
Well, I'm her boyfriend.

I'm her father.

So, what?

15:17.784 --> 15:18.718
Now you're mad at me?

15:18.818 --> 15:21.421
No, not really.

15:21.521 --> 15:22.855
So what's the problem?

15:22.956 --> 15:26.193
Well the problem is
maybe I wanted to hit him.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.094
So hit him.

15:27.194 --> 15:29.062
No.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.197
You ruined it.

was here so I hit him.

him, then you can hit him.

15:41.541 --> 15:42.742
OK.

Not that I would have hit
him, but if I'd wanted to I

15:44.511 --> 15:45.812
would have been nice
if I could have.

- OK!
- OK!

No, but he wanted to.

hang around here and make sure

this way, we're going

to say to her?

Felgred in this building?

find out anything!

19:35.908 --> 19:36.676
Come in!

19:40.313 --> 19:41.113
Hey.

19:41.214 --> 19:42.915
Hey, Mark.

19:43.015 --> 19:43.983
Becky ready yet?

19:44.083 --> 19:45.017
Becky!

19:45.117 --> 19:47.254
Should be down in a minute.

19:47.354 --> 19:48.154
Cool.

19:48.255 --> 19:49.188
Hey, Mrs. Conner.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.089
Uh.

19:53.092 --> 19:55.462
What, he's coming in the back
door now like he's family?

19:55.562 --> 19:57.029
What, are you guys
buddies now or something?

19:57.129 --> 19:57.930
Look at that!

19:58.030 --> 19:59.031
He's siting on the couch!

19:59.131 --> 20:01.067
You know I hate it
when he does that.

20:01.167 --> 20:04.170
Jeez, I go away for one day and
everything just goes to hell!

20:04.271 --> 20:05.238
Calm down.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.639
You'd have been proud
of that kid today.

20:06.739 --> 20:07.540
Why, what'd he do?

20:07.640 --> 20:09.976
Volunteer for sterilization?

20:10.076 --> 20:11.611
No, he went down
to the supermarket

20:11.711 --> 20:13.513
and beat up his boss.

20:13.613 --> 20:14.414
No.

20:14.514 --> 20:15.415
Yep.

20:15.515 --> 20:16.583
Kid called her
something very nasty,

20:16.683 --> 20:19.719
and Mark let him have it.

20:19.819 --> 20:20.620
That is so cool.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.521
Yeah.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.359
How come you didn't
beat up the creep?

20:26.459 --> 20:28.695
Well, I would have,
but I got there late!

20:28.795 --> 20:29.729
Oh, Dan.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.164
Hey, you think I'm
not sick about it?

20:32.265 --> 20:35.768
I had stuff to do at the
shop, I had to gas up the car.

20:35.868 --> 20:36.869
What's he gotta do?

20:36.969 --> 20:38.271
Smoke a cigarette and
play with his hair?

20:38.371 --> 20:39.506
Of course he got there first.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.276
Oh, I'm sorry Dan.

20:43.376 --> 20:44.944
I know you wouldn't
do it if you coulda.

20:48.681 --> 20:49.949
You know, it's kind
of cool, because this

20:50.049 --> 20:51.751
is like the first thing
he's ever done to show how

20:51.851 --> 20:53.185
much you really care about her.

20:53.286 --> 20:56.689
I also had to
make DJ breakfast.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.558
You know, maybe you ought
to throw him some more work

20:58.658 --> 20:59.892
over at the shop, you know.

20:59.992 --> 21:02.261
I mean, because maybe
this guy is the guy.

21:03.530 --> 21:05.632
BECKY: You beat him up?

21:05.732 --> 21:07.900
That's why he apologized?

21:08.000 --> 21:10.036
You can't just walk in
there like some dumb animal

21:10.136 --> 21:11.704
and beat up my boss.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.440
Now, wait a minute
the guy called you a--

21:13.540 --> 21:15.241
I know he called
me, OK, and I know

21:15.342 --> 21:17.544
how to take care of myself.

21:17.644 --> 21:19.812
Now his apology means nothing!

21:19.912 --> 21:20.813
I just thought it would be--

21:20.913 --> 21:21.914
Oh no, you didn't
think at all.

21:22.014 --> 21:23.816
You never think.

21:23.916 --> 21:25.017
OK, OK.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.052
We're going to be late
for this party, all right?

21:26.152 --> 21:26.953
Let's go.

21:27.053 --> 21:28.321
Don't you get it?

21:28.421 --> 21:30.457
I'm not going with you
to some stupid party.

21:30.557 --> 21:32.992
Now get out!

21:33.092 --> 21:33.893
Fine.

21:38.197 --> 21:39.165
See you, Mark.

21:39.265 --> 21:40.066
Yeah.

21:46.606 --> 21:48.541
I miss him already.
