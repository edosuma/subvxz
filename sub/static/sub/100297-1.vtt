WEBVTT

00:06.642 --> 00:08.416
- Whoa, whoa.
- Whoa.

00:08.417 --> 00:09.993
- Hey.
- What are you doing in here?

00:09.994 --> 00:12.205
Thursday Night Football, baby.

00:12.206 --> 00:14.923
Oh, Terry, no, no. No, Thursday
Night Football is over.

00:14.924 --> 00:17.646
What do you mean it's over?
Why would the networks do that?

00:17.647 --> 00:18.980
- That's crazy.
- Listen.

00:18.981 --> 00:20.682
Networks do a lot of weird stuff.

00:20.683 --> 00:23.652
Uh, they're based in California.
That's all I'm gonna say.

00:23.653 --> 00:26.362
I guess I will just have
to do some binge-watching!

00:26.363 --> 00:28.221
- Oh...
- Hey, have you ever seen that show

00:28.222 --> 00:29.723
Downtown Abby?

00:30.276 --> 00:33.068
- What is that girl all about?
- Oh, no,

00:33.069 --> 00:35.185
no, look, no. Uh, Mike and I...

00:35.186 --> 00:37.193
we're gonna watch our favorite show.

00:37.194 --> 00:39.076
- Really? What's it about?
- Yeah.

00:39.077 --> 00:41.578
It's about a real funny
dad and-and other people,

00:41.579 --> 00:44.248
but mostly about the funny dad.

00:44.249 --> 00:46.341
Well, the dad has a wife, too,

00:46.342 --> 00:48.326
and she's-she's smoking hot.

00:48.327 --> 00:52.422
Uh... uh, she's on that
and, like, seven other shows.

00:52.423 --> 00:56.149
Then maybe I'll just
have to find somebody else

00:56.150 --> 00:57.544
to hang out with, won't I?

00:57.545 --> 00:58.579
There you go.

00:58.580 --> 00:59.838
Howie Long.

00:59.839 --> 01:01.548
You got his number?

01:01.549 --> 01:04.718
Terry, he asked us
not to give it to you.

01:04.718 --> 01:06.925
Well, I'll see you next Thursday.

01:06.926 --> 01:08.460
Next Thursday.

01:08.461 --> 01:11.054
Thursday Night Football. All right?

01:11.055 --> 01:13.264
By the way, I'd like a little bigger TV.

01:13.265 --> 01:14.649
That's way too small.

01:14.650 --> 01:17.060
Thursday!

01:17.061 --> 01:18.828
We're gonna have to move.

01:24.401 --> 01:26.778
Whoa, whoa, boy. What is all this?

01:26.779 --> 01:28.938
Oh, I made breakfast for Vanessa.

01:28.939 --> 01:30.999
You are the most thoughtful
exchange student ever.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.633
Now get rid of all of it.

01:33.577 --> 01:35.119
Why?

01:35.120 --> 01:37.286
Just, okay, listen,
she's a little cranky.

01:37.287 --> 01:39.212
Doesn't happen often,
but when she gets cranky,

01:39.213 --> 01:41.188
this is all too much for
her. It'll be too much.

01:41.189 --> 01:42.847
You got to back off. She's like a...

01:42.848 --> 01:44.625
like a coiled snake in a bathrobe

01:44.626 --> 01:46.994
she thinks is cashmere.

01:46.995 --> 01:49.421
Backing off might be
best for those of you

01:49.422 --> 01:52.607
who are cuteness-challenged,
but I think I'll be fine.

01:53.593 --> 01:55.260
Good morning, Vanessa.

01:55.261 --> 01:58.305
I made you breakfast to
start your New Year off right.

01:58.306 --> 02:01.359
Yeah, I'll still have
to clean up the mess,

02:01.360 --> 02:03.827
so it's the same old,
same old, isn't it?

02:05.146 --> 02:06.663
I tried to warn you.

02:07.598 --> 02:09.157
"The stove is hot".

02:09.157 --> 02:11.225
"Oh, oh, this stove? Ow!"

02:12.779 --> 02:14.433
Look, I'm sor... I'm sorry, Jen.

02:14.434 --> 02:16.364
I'm just a little upset about something,

02:16.365 --> 02:17.375
so I think it would be best

02:17.376 --> 02:19.618
if everyone would just
leave me alone for a bit.

02:19.619 --> 02:22.220
Absolutely... not!

02:23.169 --> 02:25.818
No one walks away from
Jen until they have a smile

02:25.819 --> 02:27.835
on their face and a song in their heart.

02:27.836 --> 02:29.628
Jen, Jen, Jen, look at the muffin.

02:33.650 --> 02:35.453
Look at the time!

02:35.454 --> 02:39.035
I think I'll get to school
early and help the janitor...

02:39.036 --> 02:40.697
mop.

02:43.810 --> 02:45.644
I wish you wouldn't do that.

02:45.645 --> 02:48.406
What? Protect children from danger?

02:48.407 --> 02:52.226
No, no, pretend like I'm some
kind of ticking time bomb.

02:52.227 --> 02:54.183
I'm sorry if I was up late trying

02:54.184 --> 02:56.463
to-to finish the New
Year's jigsaw puzzle

02:56.464 --> 02:58.282
that I always do with
the girls, but this year

02:58.283 --> 03:00.568
I had to do all by myself,
because apparently

03:00.569 --> 03:03.662
they have fancy lives and
are too busy to stop by.

03:03.663 --> 03:05.089
Uh-huh.

03:05.090 --> 03:06.776
Just because they
don't live here anymore,

03:06.777 --> 03:08.272
does that mean everything has to change?

03:08.273 --> 03:09.744
I mean, I barely get
to see them as it is,

03:09.745 --> 03:11.429
and now I don't even
get them on New Year's?

03:11.430 --> 03:13.902
That sucks.

03:13.903 --> 03:15.353
That's it?

03:15.354 --> 03:16.896
That's it? That's all you have to say?

03:16.897 --> 03:18.906
Just "Uh-huh" and "That sucks"?

03:19.784 --> 03:21.676
Yeah.

03:21.677 --> 03:25.604
I've been burned by that stove
way too many times, honey.

03:25.605 --> 03:27.699
- Oh, you know what? Forget it. Forget it.
- No. Hey, babe.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.766
- No, I don't want to talk to you. Forget it. No, I...
- Come on, come on, stop, stop...

03:29.767 --> 03:31.110
I-I know you're upset
because you don't get

03:31.111 --> 03:33.095
to spend enough time with the girls.

03:33.096 --> 03:35.955
It's something that we're gonna
get used to, I promise. We will.

03:35.956 --> 03:37.597
Yeah?

03:37.598 --> 03:39.340
Yeah. Yeah.

03:39.341 --> 03:41.148
You know why you're saying that?

03:41.149 --> 03:42.966
Well, let's be honest.
I say a lot of stuff

03:42.967 --> 03:44.699
that I get punished for later.

03:44.700 --> 03:46.217
You're saying that

03:46.218 --> 03:48.693
because you get to see the
girls at work all the time.

03:48.694 --> 03:51.900
Kristin works for you and
now Mandy works for you.

03:51.901 --> 03:54.286
And I bet once Eve
graduates from the Academy,

03:54.287 --> 03:56.404
you're gonna steal
her away from me, too.

03:56.405 --> 03:58.047
- Don't even...
- That sucks.

04:02.387 --> 04:05.263
I'm gonna go help mop at the school.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.999
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly</font> -
- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

04:14.215 --> 04:15.924
So, as you can see,

04:15.925 --> 04:17.809
I have enough designs
in my athleisure line

04:17.810 --> 04:19.928
to fill any and all parts of the store,

04:19.928 --> 04:22.889
up to and including these offices.

04:22.890 --> 04:24.391
It's brilliant, just brilliant.

04:24.392 --> 04:26.318
It's as if da Vinci created clothes

04:26.319 --> 04:28.395
for women who want to look athletic...

04:28.396 --> 04:30.897
but aren't.

04:30.898 --> 04:32.732
You don't need to treat
her like she's my daughter.

04:32.733 --> 04:34.416
Treat her like any other supplier.

04:34.417 --> 04:36.109
All right.

04:37.405 --> 04:39.572
I like your stuff,

04:39.573 --> 04:42.242
but if it struggles for
two consecutive quarters,

04:42.243 --> 04:43.243
you're out on your ass.

04:44.078 --> 04:45.320
- Yeah? Good.
- Okay.

04:45.321 --> 04:47.747
And don't bitch about shelf space.

04:47.748 --> 04:49.457
And always remember rule number one:

04:49.458 --> 04:51.309
make me money, or I make you gone.

04:52.628 --> 04:54.663
Yes, sir.

04:54.664 --> 04:56.423
Welcome aboard, kiddo.

04:56.424 --> 04:58.281
- Thank you.
- Good.

04:58.282 --> 05:00.802
Oh, and, uh, one more rule...

05:00.803 --> 05:03.263
no fish in the microwave.

05:03.264 --> 05:05.765
Okay? No.

05:07.189 --> 05:08.527
- Thanks, Dad.
- Congratulations.

05:08.528 --> 05:10.645
Thank you. This is so exciting.

05:10.646 --> 05:13.182
- 2020 is gonna be the Year of Mandy.
- Yeah?

05:13.183 --> 05:15.517
I have a new apartment, my
clothing line's expanding.

05:15.518 --> 05:17.485
- Uh-huh.
- And Kyle's finally got...

05:17.486 --> 05:19.379
♪ A healthy sperm count! ♪

05:24.360 --> 05:25.676
Oh, grow up, Dad.

05:25.677 --> 05:26.976
You don't get another grandchild

05:26.977 --> 05:30.382
unless some guy's swimmers
meet your daughter's floaters.

05:30.383 --> 05:32.534
You've done the impossible.

05:32.535 --> 05:35.128
You've ruined the
concept of grandchildren.

05:35.129 --> 05:36.629
Hey.

05:36.630 --> 05:38.006
- Hey.
- Thank God you showed up

05:38.007 --> 05:40.892
before I willed myself to have a stroke.

05:40.893 --> 05:44.304
Okay. Uh, why did you
need to see both of us?

05:44.305 --> 05:46.381
You're coming over for
dinner Saturday night.

05:46.382 --> 05:49.017
Your mom says we don't
see enough of you girls.

05:49.018 --> 05:50.477
Now get out. I'm busy.

05:50.478 --> 05:53.021
I have plans Saturday.

05:53.022 --> 05:56.332
Ryan's taking me to a bluegrass
concert called Cornstock.

05:57.335 --> 06:00.028
Marriage is compromise.

06:00.029 --> 06:01.730
And I got plans, too, Dad.

06:01.731 --> 06:05.825
They involve Kyle and a
little bow-chicka-bow-bow.

06:05.826 --> 06:08.191
Eve is coming up from
the Air Force Academy.

06:08.192 --> 06:09.704
You're coming, too, okay?

06:09.705 --> 06:11.498
Your mom is having a hard time.

06:11.499 --> 06:14.760
Apparently she misses all of this.

06:14.761 --> 06:16.658
Well, I talk to Mom all the time.

06:16.659 --> 06:18.534
Yeah, me, too. I just
texted her this morning.

06:18.535 --> 06:19.881
That's not the same thing.

06:19.882 --> 06:21.671
She wants to be with you.

06:21.672 --> 06:23.384
You know your mom.

06:23.385 --> 06:26.012
An emotional connection to
her is a physical connection.

06:26.013 --> 06:27.496
Which is why, around our house,

06:27.497 --> 06:30.016
there's so much bom-chicka-bow-bow.

06:34.113 --> 06:36.564
- Thanks for doing this, honey.
- Mm.

06:36.565 --> 06:38.382
- Sorry I was so tough on you lately. Mmm.
- Mmm.

06:38.383 --> 06:40.468
Yeah. It was nothing.
I didn't do anything.

06:40.469 --> 06:42.825
The girls just wanted to spend
some time with you, right, guys?

06:42.826 --> 06:46.407
We're just gonna pretend
you didn't order us here?

06:46.408 --> 06:49.628
I thought you military types
were good at "Don't tell".

06:49.629 --> 06:51.873
No, no, no. It's okay, it's okay.

06:51.874 --> 06:53.965
I'm just thrilled to be
surrounded by my girls again.

06:53.966 --> 06:55.416
And we are happy to be here.

06:55.417 --> 06:58.253
It's better than a bluegrass hootenanny.

06:58.254 --> 06:59.337
I want some credit, too.

06:59.338 --> 07:01.530
I gave up a night of hot baby-making.

07:01.531 --> 07:04.257
Wow, you just got to stop this.

07:04.258 --> 07:06.600
Otherwise, I'm gonna start
mashing with your mom right now.

07:09.056 --> 07:11.483
I-I don't appreciate
that as a threat, Mike.

07:11.484 --> 07:13.802
Um, hey, you know what?

07:13.803 --> 07:15.395
How about I open a bottle of champagne,

07:15.396 --> 07:17.173
and we can toast this fabulous night?

07:17.174 --> 07:19.107
- I'm in.
- Yeah. None for me, though, thanks.

07:19.108 --> 07:20.976
Oh, come on. It's a special bottle

07:20.977 --> 07:24.479
I didn't get to open on New
Year's because I was alone.

07:24.480 --> 07:25.880
You were with me, honey.

07:27.408 --> 07:30.451
Which is alone-adjacent.

07:30.452 --> 07:32.078
I'm gonna have to pass on the champagne.

07:32.079 --> 07:33.961
Oh. You don't want a drink with dinner?

07:33.962 --> 07:36.515
Looks like Ryan had the
intervention without us.

07:36.516 --> 07:38.119
Really?

07:38.120 --> 07:39.752
I am not an alcoholic.

07:39.753 --> 07:42.797
Exactly what an alcoholic would say.

07:42.798 --> 07:48.094
But maybe there's an-another
reason I'm... not... drinking?

07:48.095 --> 07:51.113
You're... al... ready... drunk?

07:52.283 --> 07:53.766
Wait, wait.

07:53.767 --> 07:56.644
- Kristin, are you... ?
- Pregnant.

07:56.645 --> 07:58.513
Oh!

07:58.514 --> 08:00.365
Almost four months. Surprise!

08:00.366 --> 08:01.941
Oh, fantastic!

08:01.942 --> 08:03.776
Oh, my God! Congratulations!

08:03.777 --> 08:05.920
Swear to God, I knew it.

08:07.323 --> 08:10.825
Wow. That is really low, Kris.

08:10.826 --> 08:13.195
- What?!
- You know, you can't just

08:13.196 --> 08:15.288
blurt something like that
out in front of everyone.

08:15.289 --> 08:17.549
Did you even think about
how that would make me feel?

08:17.550 --> 08:19.667
I'm-I'm sorry. I'm
spending most of my time

08:19.668 --> 08:21.502
growing a human being inside of me.

08:21.503 --> 08:23.671
- Come on.
- Ugh, stop talking like that,

08:23.672 --> 08:25.398
or I'll start mashing with Mom.

08:27.485 --> 08:29.895
You're just... you're
s-so inconsiderate.

08:29.896 --> 08:31.204
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- No, Mandy, honey.

08:31.205 --> 08:32.714
No, listen, listen, listen. I... Look,

08:32.715 --> 08:34.173
I don't think it's wrong for your sister

08:34.174 --> 08:36.625
to want to share this wonderful
news with the entire family.

08:36.626 --> 08:38.519
Yeah, okay. And now you're on her side.

08:38.520 --> 08:41.313
Whoever wins, I've got next.

08:41.315 --> 08:42.741
Eve, it's not funny.

08:42.741 --> 08:43.859
Right. That... I'm sorry.

08:43.860 --> 08:45.668
I read the room wrong.

08:45.669 --> 08:49.229
Hey, how's the big family dinner going?

08:49.230 --> 08:51.157
I can't even talk to you.

08:51.158 --> 08:54.085
Well...

08:54.086 --> 08:56.238
it... it really was going quite well,

08:56.239 --> 08:58.639
you know, until you showed up.

09:05.857 --> 09:07.507
This is so sad.

09:07.508 --> 09:10.248
Uh, I mean, tonight should
have been a-a joyous time

09:10.249 --> 09:12.604
for our family. Kristin's having a baby.

09:12.605 --> 09:16.608
And this time she's married
and not in high school.

09:16.609 --> 09:18.760
Honey, honey. Yeah.

09:18.761 --> 09:21.263
Look, I-I usually find your ability

09:21.264 --> 09:23.856
to lighten the mood kind of sexy.

09:23.857 --> 09:26.359
- Usually?
- Huh? Yeah, but one more joke,

09:26.360 --> 09:28.502
I'm gonna hit you in
the nuts with the lamp.

09:31.031 --> 09:34.742
Mandy is upset because
Kris just gets pregnant,

09:34.743 --> 09:37.446
and she and Kyle have been
working so hard to get pregnant.

09:37.447 --> 09:39.414
And there, you made me acknowledge it.

09:39.415 --> 09:43.251
I know, I know, but-but
what Mandy did was not okay,

09:43.252 --> 09:44.877
and I'm gonna talk to her about it.

09:44.878 --> 09:46.455
You know what? I'm
gonna talk to Kris, too,

09:46.456 --> 09:48.139
because I-I'm sure she feels robbed

09:48.140 --> 09:50.925
of what should have been
an exciting family moment.

09:50.926 --> 09:53.311
This is probably a risky thing to say

09:53.312 --> 09:55.696
with you so close to that lamp.

09:57.483 --> 09:59.651
I think you should stay out of it.

09:59.652 --> 10:02.654
By "stay out of it",
you mean what exactly?

10:02.655 --> 10:04.664
What? Stop mothering my children?

10:05.825 --> 10:07.875
Hmm. Excuse me. Uh...

10:10.446 --> 10:12.447
You've done a great job
mothering those girls

10:12.448 --> 10:14.165
- while they were living here.
- Mm-hmm.

10:14.166 --> 10:15.834
But now they're grown-ups,
they're out on their own.

10:15.835 --> 10:17.618
They got to figure
this out by themselves.

10:17.619 --> 10:20.655
- Well, what if they don't?
- Then you're a lousy mother.

10:20.656 --> 10:22.802
Hand me the lamp.

10:22.803 --> 10:23.883
- Listen, listen...
- I...

10:23.884 --> 10:25.844
Mandy's gonna figure out
she did something wrong

10:25.845 --> 10:27.962
and she's gonna fix it...
I'm 100% sure of that.

10:27.963 --> 10:29.331
Look, I hope you're right

10:29.332 --> 10:31.299
because I would really miss that lamp.

10:31.300 --> 10:32.851
Come on, you'd really miss...

10:32.852 --> 10:34.527
I'd miss the lamp.

10:38.524 --> 10:41.009
- Yeah.
- Hey, Mr. B.

10:41.010 --> 10:44.179
Hey, you got a minute for
a couple of sons-in-laws-es?

10:44.180 --> 10:45.605
"Sons-in-laws-eez"? Sons-in... ?

10:45.606 --> 10:48.660
Listen, hey, um... congratulations.

10:48.661 --> 10:49.854
You and Boyd must be happy.

10:49.855 --> 10:51.202
- Thank you. Yeah, we are.
- Yeah.

10:51.203 --> 10:53.355
- Um, that's actually why we came by.
- Okay.

10:53.356 --> 10:56.046
We heard the announcement last
night was a... little tense.

10:56.047 --> 10:57.541
Little tense. Yes, I don't think

10:57.542 --> 10:59.462
a dinner's gone that badly
since the Last Supper.

11:01.121 --> 11:03.548
Uh, this is all my fault.

11:03.549 --> 11:05.333
I'm not sure how,

11:05.334 --> 11:08.127
but when I say that,
people usually feel better.

11:08.128 --> 11:10.004
Actually, it was your fault, you know.

11:10.005 --> 11:12.057
Mandy wouldn't have
anything to be jealous over

11:12.058 --> 11:15.134
had you kept your sperm count low,

11:15.135 --> 11:18.070
where evolution wisely put it.

11:20.307 --> 11:22.475
Damn my boxer shorts.

11:22.476 --> 11:25.265
Look, Kris has been trying
to get hold of Mandy,

11:25.266 --> 11:26.303
but she's not answering.

11:26.304 --> 11:28.073
So now Kris is walking around all mad.

11:28.074 --> 11:30.650
And this time she's mad for two.

11:30.651 --> 11:32.722
And even though we're their husbands,

11:32.723 --> 11:33.970
we don't feel like it's right for us

11:33.971 --> 11:35.621
to tell 'em they have to talk.

11:38.676 --> 11:40.418
Oh, oh.

11:40.419 --> 11:42.237
You want me to say something?

11:42.238 --> 11:44.305
- Yes.
- No.

11:46.425 --> 11:48.410
But they'll listen to
you. Everybody does.

11:48.411 --> 11:50.503
He doesn't listen to me.

11:50.504 --> 11:52.731
If he did, the only person
he could get pregnant

11:52.732 --> 11:54.457
would be himself.

11:57.553 --> 11:59.254
I don't follow.

11:59.255 --> 12:00.680
Oh, I'll explain it to you later.

12:00.681 --> 12:03.775
It's super hilarious.

12:03.776 --> 12:05.658
They're adults. I want
them to act like adults.

12:05.659 --> 12:06.778
I don't want them doing stuff

12:06.779 --> 12:08.654
because their dad tells them to do it.

12:08.655 --> 12:10.765
Come on, Mike. There's got to
be something that you can do.

12:10.766 --> 12:12.450
I've already done it.

12:12.451 --> 12:15.270
I-I've spent 20-some-odd
years raising those girls.

12:15.271 --> 12:18.380
I-It's got to be enough.
That's it. Dismissed.

12:20.459 --> 12:23.411
Oh, now I get it. Because he's
always telling you to go...

12:23.412 --> 12:25.304
Yeah, super hilarious.

12:29.560 --> 12:30.843
- Hey, Chuck.
- Oh, hey.

12:30.844 --> 12:33.239
I know you're not Dad's
secretary, but is he in?

12:33.240 --> 12:34.589
He told me to come up at 3:00.

12:34.590 --> 12:36.716
Everyone says they know
I'm not his secretary,

12:36.717 --> 12:38.977
but everyone acts like I am.

12:38.978 --> 12:41.487
Go on in. Go ahead.

12:43.741 --> 12:46.225
What are you doing here?

12:46.226 --> 12:47.636
I have a meeting with Dad.

12:47.637 --> 12:49.137
What are you doing here?

12:49.138 --> 12:51.230
Oh, well, news flash, Dad's not in here.

12:51.231 --> 12:52.623
And neither am I.

12:53.901 --> 12:56.444
Well, I won't be.

12:56.445 --> 12:58.070
You know what, shut up!

12:58.071 --> 13:00.256
Oh.

13:01.333 --> 13:03.409
Nobody is going anywhere.

13:03.410 --> 13:04.749
Your dad said you two were supposed

13:04.750 --> 13:07.172
to have a meeting at 3:00.

13:07.173 --> 13:08.931
So have a meeting.

13:12.937 --> 13:15.563
And I am not his damn secretary.

13:17.000 --> 13:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:24.177 --> 13:26.599
I can't believe you.
You're not talking to me

13:26.600 --> 13:28.834
because you think that I
deliberately got pregnant

13:28.835 --> 13:31.312
just to ruin the "Year of Mandy"?

13:31.313 --> 13:34.106
Wow. You don't even know what
you did; that's even worse.

13:34.107 --> 13:35.647
I would ask you what's even worse,

13:35.648 --> 13:37.185
but I know you won't talk to me.

13:37.186 --> 13:39.654
Yeah, because we don't
talk, Kris, we-we chat.

13:39.655 --> 13:42.467
The diet soda of conversation.

13:42.468 --> 13:45.860
And even though I love diet
soda, that is a bad thing.

13:45.861 --> 13:49.330
Well, I am the whole milk of confused.

13:49.331 --> 13:51.700
Talking would be stuff like, uh,

13:51.701 --> 13:54.321
"Hey, Mandy, you're my best friend

13:54.322 --> 13:56.221
so you should be the first to know

13:56.222 --> 13:58.105
that you're going to be an aunt again".

14:01.009 --> 14:04.637
Wh... So-so you're not
jealous, you're hurt?

14:04.638 --> 14:06.305
That's even crazier.

14:06.306 --> 14:07.478
Yeah, well, we're supposed

14:07.479 --> 14:09.509
to share important
stuff with each other.

14:09.510 --> 14:11.310
Who was the first person I told

14:11.311 --> 14:14.572
when Kyle's low sperm
count skyrocketed? You!

14:14.573 --> 14:16.224
Yes, yes, that was me.

14:16.225 --> 14:20.061
Quite the honor.

14:20.062 --> 14:22.822
But I guess you don't want
to do that anymore. Fine.

14:22.823 --> 14:26.701
I don't, I don't want to be
the first person you tell.

14:26.702 --> 14:28.886
Mandy...

14:33.000 --> 14:35.577
Do you remember a couple of years ago

14:35.578 --> 14:39.647
when you were the first
person I told I was pregnant?

14:43.233 --> 14:44.533
And then you weren't.

14:47.439 --> 14:49.760
I'm really sorry, I didn't
mean to remind you of that.

14:49.761 --> 14:51.426
It's okay.

14:51.427 --> 14:53.185
It was really early in the pregnancy,

14:53.186 --> 14:55.730
and miscarriages happen sometimes.

14:55.731 --> 14:57.748
Yeah.

15:00.402 --> 15:02.453
I remember how sad it made you.

15:02.454 --> 15:05.130
And I remember how sad it made you.

15:06.718 --> 15:10.820
I wished I had waited
longer to tell you.

15:10.821 --> 15:12.985
So that's why you waited this time.

15:12.986 --> 15:15.082
And just so you know, you were gonna be

15:15.083 --> 15:16.898
the first person I told this time, too.

15:16.899 --> 15:18.419
But the other night,

15:18.420 --> 15:21.765
Wineboat Annie started
pushing the bubbly and...

15:21.766 --> 15:24.626
it just came out, you know.

15:24.627 --> 15:26.461
I couldn't help myself.

15:26.462 --> 15:29.263
Okay, wait, I have a great idea.

15:29.264 --> 15:31.966
Why don't we have an
announcement do-over right now.

15:31.967 --> 15:34.435
Isn't that kind of silly?

15:34.436 --> 15:35.820
No, no, no, it'll be great.

15:37.640 --> 15:40.975
♪ La-la, la-la-la-la, la, la. ♪

15:40.976 --> 15:43.328
Hey, Kris. Hey.

15:43.329 --> 15:45.112
What did you want to talk to me about?

15:45.113 --> 15:48.574
Okay, fine, Mandy.

15:48.575 --> 15:52.987
Uh, I wanted you to be the
first to know... I'm pregnant.

15:52.988 --> 15:54.914
I can't believe you're having a baby

15:54.915 --> 15:56.682
and ruining the Year of Mandy.

15:59.011 --> 16:00.511
You know what?

16:00.512 --> 16:02.054
You weren't even the
first person I told.

16:02.055 --> 16:05.607
I told Eve and... and
I don't even like her.

16:06.635 --> 16:08.594
This is so great.

16:08.595 --> 16:10.262
I can't wait to be pregnant now

16:10.263 --> 16:11.639
so we can go through it together.

16:11.640 --> 16:15.526
Yeah, it's a blast.

16:15.527 --> 16:17.436
Next time something's bothering you,

16:17.437 --> 16:19.347
will you please just tell me?

16:19.348 --> 16:21.532
Because you-you are my best friend.

16:21.533 --> 16:24.202
I promise.

16:24.203 --> 16:25.687
Also, this is, like,

16:25.688 --> 16:27.279
the best meeting I've ever had.

16:30.158 --> 16:31.693
Ooh. Oh.

16:31.694 --> 16:34.720
The world needs more of this.

16:43.814 --> 16:46.374
Ugh.

16:46.375 --> 16:49.135
Ugh, why haven't they called?

16:49.136 --> 16:50.678
Not knowing is killing me.

16:50.679 --> 16:53.061
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine.

16:53.062 --> 16:55.216
Look, they're either still talking,

16:55.217 --> 16:57.402
or one of them tried
to get rid of the body.

16:57.403 --> 17:00.182
I'm calling them.

17:00.183 --> 17:01.556
- Don't do it, please, honey...
- No, no, no, look.

17:01.557 --> 17:03.343
You know, I don't feel
good about Mandy dealing

17:03.344 --> 17:05.478
- with this by herself.
- Just put it down for me.

17:08.530 --> 17:10.064
Remember the time that she begged us

17:10.065 --> 17:11.699
to make the family dinner? Hmm?

17:11.700 --> 17:15.569
- She made soup out of grass.
- Mm.

17:15.570 --> 17:18.705
- Come on. She was a child.
- Ah.

17:18.707 --> 17:21.375
- She was a child, right?
- Mm.

17:21.376 --> 17:23.398
Yeah. And Kristin actually ate it

17:23.400 --> 17:25.096
because she didn't
want Mandy to feel bad.

17:25.097 --> 17:26.931
Yeah, but then Kristin felt horrible

17:26.932 --> 17:30.768
'cause I'd just fertilized the lawn.

17:30.769 --> 17:32.887
Yeah, those two have
always been so close.

17:32.888 --> 17:35.773
I don't think I can handle
it if they lose that.

17:35.774 --> 17:36.840
It's not gonna happen.

17:36.841 --> 17:38.259
Listen, I know their mom.

17:38.260 --> 17:39.260
Thanks.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.838
Can I confess something that's, uh...

17:43.839 --> 17:45.767
that's gonna sound horrible?

17:45.768 --> 17:47.602
Sure. As long as you
don't finish the sentence

17:47.603 --> 17:49.169
and say, "Your turn".

17:52.741 --> 17:55.610
There is a... part of me

17:55.611 --> 17:57.795
that almost hopes they don't work it out

17:57.796 --> 18:00.114
because then that'll mean

18:00.115 --> 18:02.842
that they no longer need me.

18:04.636 --> 18:06.645
That make me an awful person?

18:07.714 --> 18:10.124
Good parent, you raise them

18:10.125 --> 18:12.143
and they don't need you.

18:12.144 --> 18:14.261
And it sucks. You know?

18:14.262 --> 18:18.265
You're a great parent,
they still want you.

18:18.266 --> 18:20.392
- Hmm.
- Hey, anybody home?

18:20.393 --> 18:22.102
I got a pregnant lady here who's hungry.

18:22.103 --> 18:25.898
And it's not me.

18:25.899 --> 18:28.907
Oh, my goodness. What are
you guys, uh, doing here?

18:28.908 --> 18:31.646
Well, I went by Dad's office to
straighten these two clowns out,

18:31.647 --> 18:34.448
but they had figured everything
out before I could hit anybody.

18:34.449 --> 18:38.077
Well, um, we wanted to
come over and apologize.

18:38.078 --> 18:40.004
Yeah, Dad said that you
really missed seeing us,

18:40.005 --> 18:42.657
and we went and screwed it up.

18:42.658 --> 18:43.992
I didn't.

18:43.993 --> 18:45.793
I did what I always do...

18:45.794 --> 18:47.773
cracked a couple of jokes

18:47.774 --> 18:50.832
and snuck two beers into the den.

18:50.833 --> 18:53.668
You still can't drink
here unless you're 21.

18:53.669 --> 18:55.936
I am 21.

18:55.937 --> 18:57.595
Ha.

18:57.596 --> 18:59.655
Swear to God, I knew that.

19:01.527 --> 19:05.604
Uh, real smooth having Chuck
lock us in your office, Dad.

19:05.605 --> 19:07.773
Yeah, why was he
crying when I got there?

19:07.774 --> 19:11.185
Yeah... we did that.

19:11.186 --> 19:13.754
Marines.

19:15.541 --> 19:17.658
I am just glad you're here

19:17.659 --> 19:20.820
because I really miss this.

19:20.821 --> 19:23.497
Oh, Mommy, you-you finished the
New Year's puzzle by yourself.

19:23.498 --> 19:25.216
Yeah, well, I... it wasn't as much fun,

19:25.217 --> 19:27.793
but-but it was quicker.

19:27.794 --> 19:29.810
Well, next year we'll be sure to come by

19:29.811 --> 19:31.039
and do it all together.

19:31.040 --> 19:33.875
- You know what, it's not quite done.
- Hey! No!

19:33.876 --> 19:35.636
No, really, there's
a little bit left here.

19:35.637 --> 19:37.177
- Come on. Oh, look.
- Oh, no!

19:37.178 --> 19:39.179
- Look, I tell you what.
- What are you doing?

19:39.180 --> 19:41.307
I'm going to the garage.
That's what I'm gonna do.

19:41.308 --> 19:43.142
You want to help us?

19:43.143 --> 19:45.236
I think I already put
my puzzle together.

19:46.738 --> 19:48.856
You do realize next year

19:48.857 --> 19:51.392
this will be a choking hazard?

19:51.393 --> 19:55.229
Or you could give it to
Mandy and make it one now.

19:55.230 --> 19:57.615
Hey, uh, Eve, why don't you let me

19:57.616 --> 20:00.592
whip you up a cup of soup?

20:01.828 --> 20:03.754
You missed this?

20:03.755 --> 20:05.907
Absolutely.

20:14.215 --> 20:16.100
Hey, Mike Baxter for Outdoor Man,

20:16.101 --> 20:18.586
where we're all about
passing down traditions.

20:18.587 --> 20:21.221
That's why we're having
a Grandparents Day sale,

20:21.222 --> 20:23.284
where, if you come
in with your grandkid,

20:23.285 --> 20:24.926
I'll give you 20% off

20:24.927 --> 20:26.594
on all of our camping
equipment, all right?

20:26.595 --> 20:28.187
But don't just borrow a neighbor kid

20:28.188 --> 20:30.932
to just save a little dough.

20:30.933 --> 20:32.733
You try that move and you're gonna get

20:32.734 --> 20:35.861
a butt full of hot buckshot.

20:35.862 --> 20:38.205
And nothing makes me
happier than thinking

20:38.206 --> 20:40.407
about being a grandpa again.

20:40.408 --> 20:43.294
And nothing makes me less
happy than thinking about

20:43.295 --> 20:46.413
what had to happen to make that happen.

20:48.800 --> 20:51.761
Why couldn't the stork
have been real, man?

20:51.762 --> 20:53.971
It's easier, cleaner, better.

20:53.972 --> 20:55.589
I prefer that story.

20:55.590 --> 20:59.293
Of course, in nature storks
are real but they're mean.

20:59.294 --> 21:01.963
They're mean. Mean damn birds.

21:01.964 --> 21:04.298
They kick their kids out
of the nest after 60 days

21:04.299 --> 21:05.967
and don't give a flying fork

21:05.968 --> 21:08.486
if they visit at New Year's.

21:08.487 --> 21:11.218
The best thing about pushing
humans out of the nest

21:11.219 --> 21:13.273
is that they circle
back and often hand you

21:13.274 --> 21:16.902
a smaller, cuter version
of themselves to look after.

21:16.903 --> 21:20.831
It's a beautiful tradition
called "free babysitting".

21:20.832 --> 21:23.515
And, listen, I take my responsibility

21:23.516 --> 21:25.244
as a grandfather very seriously.

21:25.245 --> 21:27.579
Someone has to teach
the youngest generation

21:27.580 --> 21:31.099
the right way to insert
an M-80 in a watermelon.

21:32.252 --> 21:34.345
Baxter out.
