WEBVTT

00:07.613 --> 00:09.046
Got it. Code 12.

00:09.048 --> 00:10.913
The models have
entered the building.

00:10.915 --> 00:12.080
- Okay.
- That's Code 12.

00:12.082 --> 00:13.314
It's go time.
How's my hair?

00:13.316 --> 00:15.049
- Perfectly tousled.
- Why so anxious?

00:15.051 --> 00:16.250
You date models all the time.

00:16.251 --> 00:17.484
From the Sears catalog.

00:17.486 --> 00:18.585
These are
Victoria’s Secret models.

00:18.587 --> 00:19.586
There's a difference.

00:19.588 --> 00:20.754
There's no difference.

00:20.756 --> 00:21.954
They're human coat hangers.

00:21.956 --> 00:23.756
- They're mannequins who can vote.
- Hey!

00:23.758 --> 00:25.024
You watch your mouth.

00:25.026 --> 00:26.392
Models are people, too.

00:26.394 --> 00:27.660
Don't mock them just because
they're beautiful.

00:27.662 --> 00:29.161
In fact,
this is why I date models:

00:29.163 --> 00:30.262
to fight this kind of prejudice.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.730
- You are so brave.
- The models

00:31.732 --> 00:33.232
are in the elevator.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.766
They will be arriving
in three...

00:34.768 --> 00:35.767
two...

01:16.576 --> 01:18.077
Oh, my God.

01:18.079 --> 01:21.246
I always dreamed
of wearing the Fantasy Bra.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.280
How sweet.

01:22.282 --> 01:23.414
Whenever I get the catalogs,

01:23.416 --> 01:24.848
I cut off Adriana Lima's head

01:24.850 --> 01:26.784
and paste my own face
into the picture.

01:26.786 --> 01:28.486
Little less sweet.

01:28.488 --> 01:31.355
I have one rule
and one rule only:

01:31.357 --> 01:34.223
If anybody touches

and his or her name is not

01:37.894 --> 01:39.994
or Adriana Lima's bosom...

01:39.996 --> 01:41.296
we're gonna have a problem.

01:41.298 --> 01:42.764
Oh, the Fantasy Bra!

02:11.655 --> 02:13.020
There it is, fellas.

02:13.022 --> 02:14.754
Everybody likes pie,

02:14.756 --> 02:16.555
except for terrorists
and Canadians.

02:16.557 --> 02:17.689
So, what's your verdict?

02:17.691 --> 02:20.324
Well, we went to
a whole lot of agencies,

02:20.326 --> 02:21.792
and hearing nothing
but double-talk.

02:21.794 --> 02:22.926
Double-talk and
fruity pitches.

02:22.928 --> 02:24.494
- Yeah, fruity pitches.
- You betcha.

02:24.496 --> 02:26.228
So we really appreciate
you staying

02:26.230 --> 02:28.063
inside the box on this, you know?
Mmm.

02:28.065 --> 02:29.163
Nice and simple.

02:29.165 --> 02:31.132
Well, that's our Sydney.
"Simple Sydney."

02:31.134 --> 02:32.833
If you want fancy, forget it.

02:32.835 --> 02:34.468
She's not gonna
push the envelope.

02:34.470 --> 02:36.570
- She's not even gonna lick the envelope.
- Gordon...

02:36.572 --> 02:38.571
Oh, popular fella.

02:38.573 --> 02:40.039
You need to grab that?

02:40.041 --> 02:42.474
No, no. It's just
the old ball and chain.

02:42.476 --> 02:43.408
- Hey, been there.
- Done that.

02:43.410 --> 02:44.442
Yeah.

02:44.444 --> 02:45.776
So how is the little lady?

02:45.778 --> 02:47.110
Not so little and not a lady...

02:47.112 --> 02:49.879
Doing great, actually.
Making dinner.

02:49.881 --> 02:51.046
Italian wedding soup.

02:51.048 --> 02:53.181
Yeah, I have no idea
what the hell's in it.

02:53.183 --> 02:54.315
But I'm gonna love it,

02:54.317 --> 02:55.483
I'll tell you that right now,

02:55.485 --> 02:56.483
because it's about, uh...

02:56.485 --> 02:57.484
it's about family.

02:57.486 --> 02:58.952
Family is everything.

02:58.954 --> 03:00.153
Indeed. Yeah, you betcha.

03:00.155 --> 03:01.820
So, what's your dad like, huh?

03:01.822 --> 03:04.723
He a traditional fella,
like old Gordon here?

03:04.725 --> 03:06.558
Use your wings, let 'em fly.

03:06.560 --> 03:07.825
Let your wings fly, like...

03:07.827 --> 03:09.827
Maybe not that traditional, but...
Almost Amish.

03:09.829 --> 03:11.928
Good.
Real good.

03:11.930 --> 03:14.464
We've been to every
agency in town, and...

03:14.466 --> 03:15.831
aw, heck, I'm just
gonna say it.

03:15.833 --> 03:17.999
Their thinking is just too out there.
Way out there.

03:18.001 --> 03:20.234
Well, if there is one
thing that we are not,

03:20.236 --> 03:21.734
it's "out there."

03:21.736 --> 03:22.701
There they are.

03:22.703 --> 03:23.769
Let them go, fly...

03:23.771 --> 03:25.170
fly... and then stop!

03:25.172 --> 03:28.406
- I'm excited. Yeah. - So, will
Simon be joining us for lunch?

03:28.408 --> 03:30.208
Oh, not a chance. We could
probably arrange a meeting...

03:30.210 --> 03:31.676
Yeah, no, he's running a shoot.

03:31.678 --> 03:32.677
Oh.

03:32.679 --> 03:33.811
Well, that...
that's too bad.

03:33.813 --> 03:35.680
Yeah, we wouldn't
feel comfortable

03:35.682 --> 03:37.115
handing over our business
without having lunch

03:37.117 --> 03:38.516
with him, you know. Why not?

03:38.518 --> 03:40.085
If he's a straight shooter
like you, we're good to go.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.353
Shoots very straight.

03:41.355 --> 03:42.588
Okay, so, yeah...

03:42.590 --> 03:44.723
Hover, people.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.324
There we go, hover.
There we go, just hover.

03:46.326 --> 03:47.625
- Keep going...
- Yeah.

03:47.627 --> 03:48.993
- Sure.
- You betcha.

03:48.995 --> 03:51.028
Why not? Sure.

03:58.354 --> 04:00.287
So you want me

04:00.289 --> 04:02.188
to go to lunch,
but only if I act...

04:02.190 --> 04:03.789
what was that distasteful word
you used, again?

04:03.791 --> 04:06.791
"Normal." Look, these
are traditional clients,

04:06.793 --> 04:08.859
and you're a little colorful
for their tastes.

04:08.861 --> 04:10.393
Like that ridiculous tie.

04:10.395 --> 04:11.460
I love this tie.

04:11.462 --> 04:12.594
And my colorfulness

04:12.596 --> 04:14.028
is what brings everyone
to this agency.

04:14.030 --> 04:15.429
Not everyone, okay?

04:15.431 --> 04:17.731
Because 30% of our client base

04:17.733 --> 04:19.464
prefers things boring and safe.

04:19.466 --> 04:20.666
If these pie people
want us to change

04:20.668 --> 04:22.034
who we are, then
we don't want 'em.

04:22.036 --> 04:24.535
Yes, we do, because they're
about to go national.

04:24.537 --> 04:26.070
Listen, I've been out, loud

04:26.072 --> 04:28.571
and proud ever since I was
on the Radical Faerie float

04:28.573 --> 04:30.072
in the Gay Pride Parade.

04:30.074 --> 04:32.373
But when Timothy texted me
during that pitch,

04:32.375 --> 04:34.642
well, I just played it off
like he was my wife,

04:34.644 --> 04:36.342
because you do
what you have to do

04:36.344 --> 04:37.777
to land the client.

04:37.779 --> 04:40.078
I believe you referred to him
as "the old ball and chain."

04:40.080 --> 04:41.378
Liar.

04:41.380 --> 04:42.479
Actually, that is not a lie.

04:42.481 --> 04:44.113
Balls and chains
have been involved.

04:44.115 --> 04:46.114
Well, I'm not gonna pretend
to be someone I'm not

04:46.116 --> 04:48.283
just to satisfy the whims of
some narrow-minded clients.

04:48.285 --> 04:50.585
And that is exactly why
you're not in the pitches.

04:50.587 --> 04:52.087
I could've been at the pitch,

04:52.089 --> 04:54.455
if I didn't have the
Victoria's Secret shoot...

04:54.457 --> 04:56.723
which you intentionally
scheduled during your pitch.

04:58.058 --> 05:00.592
Well, it's not my fault you're
distracted by shiny objects.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.074

05:17.738 --> 05:18.905
Wow.

05:18.907 --> 05:20.106
Literally shiny objects.

05:20.108 --> 05:21.874
You've been managing me
this whole time.

05:21.876 --> 05:24.611
You've been pulling my strings
like some monstrous puppeteer.

05:24.613 --> 05:26.279
Okay, you want me
to cut the strings?

05:26.281 --> 05:27.280
Consider them clipped.

05:27.282 --> 05:28.448
I'll just call off the lunch,

05:28.450 --> 05:29.849
and we can kiss
the account good-bye.

05:29.851 --> 05:32.185
Good. That way, we can keep
our dignity and ethics intact.

05:32.187 --> 05:33.987
Uh, Simon, exactly
how much bottom cleavage

05:33.989 --> 05:35.187
are we allowed to show?

05:35.189 --> 05:36.188
Uh, two fingers.

05:36.190 --> 05:37.289
Three at the most.

05:37.291 --> 05:39.324
Good.

05:39.326 --> 05:40.792
Now, where was I?

05:40.794 --> 05:42.027
Dignity and ethics.

05:42.029 --> 05:43.328
Yes.

05:43.330 --> 05:45.430
All right, I'll dial it
back a notch for the lunch.

05:45.432 --> 05:47.365
Good. So no crazy
character voices,

05:47.367 --> 05:48.467
no fruity orders...

05:48.469 --> 05:49.935
So Dandy Randy
and his Banana Band

05:49.937 --> 05:52.070
won't be ordering the beet salad
with the culinary foam?

05:52.072 --> 05:53.705
They will not.

05:53.707 --> 05:55.007
Okay.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.081
So, what did you do

06:04.083 --> 06:05.616
with the pictures of my head

06:05.618 --> 06:07.118
that you cut out
from the catalog?

06:07.120 --> 06:09.087
Drew angry red X's
on them, burned them

06:09.089 --> 06:10.555
and buried the ashes.

06:10.557 --> 06:12.324
Maybe you'd be more comfortable

06:12.326 --> 06:13.959
with a wardrobe person
helping you.

06:13.961 --> 06:15.894
No.

06:15.896 --> 06:17.429
You're a disturbed girl.

06:18.598 --> 06:20.766
I like disturbed girls.

06:21.735 --> 06:23.402
Excuse me.

06:23.404 --> 06:24.369
It's Ibiza calling.

06:24.371 --> 06:26.739
Hello, Ibiza...

06:34.248 --> 06:37.350
You really are angels...

06:37.352 --> 06:39.052
fallen from Heaven.

06:39.054 --> 06:40.253
What?

06:41.255 --> 06:43.123
Hang on.

06:44.192 --> 06:45.292
I don't
know what's wrong.

06:45.294 --> 06:46.993
I just gave them the angel bit,

06:46.995 --> 06:47.927
and they're not biting.

06:47.929 --> 06:49.161
Well, perhaps it's because

06:49.163 --> 06:50.562
they're Victoria's
Secret Angels,

06:50.564 --> 06:52.364
so they've heard it maybe
once or twice before.

06:52.366 --> 06:53.965
Of course.
Right.

06:53.967 --> 06:54.933
Oh, God.

06:54.935 --> 06:56.434
What were you thinking?

06:56.436 --> 06:58.169
I need to escalate
to the smile.

06:58.171 --> 06:59.404
Maybe that's it.
Yeah.

06:59.406 --> 07:00.972
Yeah.

07:00.974 --> 07:04.143
I don't know if
I mentioned it, earlier,

07:04.145 --> 07:05.912
but I'm Zachary.

07:05.914 --> 07:06.979
No.

07:06.981 --> 07:08.580
Hang on.

07:10.384 --> 07:12.085
Gosh, what's the next
move, Professor?

07:12.087 --> 07:13.286
I don't know.

07:13.288 --> 07:14.754
I've never had to go
past the smile before.

07:14.756 --> 07:16.989
- Hmm.
- Wait a minute.

Look, they see pretty boys
like you all the time.

You're just the male version
of a perfect...

He's doing magic.

Ooh.

Ooh, do it again.

07:54.431 --> 07:57.533
May I have everyone's
attention, please?

07:57.535 --> 07:59.701
Ladies, Simon Roberts has been
called away on business,

07:59.703 --> 08:01.136
so I'm going to be
running the shoot now.

08:01.138 --> 08:03.472
And I don't want you
to be intimidated by me

08:03.474 --> 08:04.807
because I'm a powerful woman.

08:04.809 --> 08:06.308
I have a secret for you guys.

08:06.310 --> 08:07.909
You are powerful women...

08:07.911 --> 08:09.645
Room temp bubbly water.

08:10.747 --> 08:12.948
I'll be in my office.

08:13.850 --> 08:15.050
Guys, I need you.

08:16.085 --> 08:17.419
Right now.

08:21.659 --> 08:23.159
I just wanted
to try on the bra,

08:23.161 --> 08:24.293
and now I can't get it off.

08:24.295 --> 08:26.162
That's not gonna be a problem.

08:26.164 --> 08:28.298
Not exactly my first rodeo.

08:28.300 --> 08:29.532
Here...

08:30.502 --> 08:32.168
Ah, screw this!
I could be out there

08:32.169 --> 08:33.837
pulling rabbits out of
models' ears right now.

08:33.839 --> 08:35.138
Settle down, boy.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.739
It requires nimble fingers

08:36.741 --> 08:37.674
and a light touch.

08:37.676 --> 08:39.376
I'm not your "boy," Colonel.

08:39.378 --> 08:40.876
Ooh, I see.
This is based off

08:40.879 --> 08:42.544
the '97 Parisian model
Coco Chanel originally...

08:42.547 --> 08:43.513
Just get it off!

08:43.515 --> 08:44.714
Ok... Ok...

08:44.716 --> 08:46.983
It's like some weird, foreign,

08:46.985 --> 08:49.051
alien architecture. It's like a
magical Chinese finger trap.

08:49.053 --> 08:50.786
Okay, what is going on here?

08:50.788 --> 08:52.020
What is happening to me?

08:52.022 --> 08:53.188
I can't pick up models,

08:53.190 --> 08:54.556
I can't pop off a bra...

08:54.558 --> 08:55.891
- Who the hell am I?
- Who cares?!

08:55.893 --> 08:57.092
We just have to get it off

08:57.094 --> 08:58.527
before someone finds out.

08:58.529 --> 08:59.762
Hey, you guys,
what's going on in there?

08:59.764 --> 09:01.597
- Caught.
- Hurry up.

09:01.599 --> 09:02.799
I think the models are saying

09:02.801 --> 09:04.300
mean things about me
in Portuguese.

09:04.302 --> 09:05.502
Sydney will kill me.

09:05.504 --> 09:07.137
She's ten feet of crazy
a five-four frame.

09:07.139 --> 09:09.439
I know what to do.

09:09.441 --> 09:10.741
Go away!

09:10.743 --> 09:11.742
What?

09:11.744 --> 09:12.709
That was your plan?

09:12.711 --> 09:13.711
No!

09:13.713 --> 09:15.279
That's not all of it.

09:15.980 --> 09:18.015
Please.

09:18.017 --> 09:20.717
Fine, but... I'll be back
in a few minutes.

09:20.719 --> 09:22.286
We need to get shooting.

09:22.288 --> 09:23.453
That worked.
How did that work?

09:23.455 --> 09:24.455
I have no idea.

09:25.791 --> 09:27.658
Oh.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.730
We're gonna have a problem.

09:41.409 --> 09:43.610
And you had to wear the tie?

09:43.612 --> 09:45.779
Why don't you let me
handle me, Nitpick Nancy?

09:45.781 --> 09:47.013
You don't think,
after 25 years,

09:47.015 --> 09:48.748
I can walk the walk
and talk the talk?

09:48.750 --> 09:49.715
Relax.

09:49.717 --> 09:51.017
There he is.
Hey, big guy.

09:51.019 --> 09:52.084
Gentlemen, Simon Roberts.

09:52.086 --> 09:54.053
How the hell are you, huh?

09:54.055 --> 09:55.721
Hey, what's up, there, hey?

09:55.723 --> 09:56.956
Come on, strap on
your feedbags,

09:56.958 --> 09:58.724
'cause this joint has
some grade-A chow.

09:58.726 --> 09:59.959
Hey, super hungry.
Out of sight.

09:59.961 --> 10:02.028
Simon
Roberts, you are here!

10:02.030 --> 10:03.096
Monsieur! Hello, eh?

10:03.098 --> 10:04.831
As always, my 'eart leaps!

10:04.833 --> 10:05.898
Oh! Don't be afraid,
I caught it,

10:05.900 --> 10:06.899
and back at you.

10:06.901 --> 10:09.168
Ooh!

10:09.903 --> 10:10.970
We are starving.

10:12.874 --> 10:15.841
Catherine Deneuve la vie en
rose baguette Pepe le Peu!

10:15.843 --> 10:17.209
Simon!
I never know what

10:17.211 --> 10:18.778
is going to come
out of your mouth, eh?

10:18.780 --> 10:20.012
I do.

10:20.014 --> 10:21.814
Good common sense
and traditional values.

10:21.816 --> 10:22.982
- Right?
- Okay.

10:22.984 --> 10:24.651
Okay, I have to take this one.

10:24.653 --> 10:25.752
Excuse me, will you?

10:25.754 --> 10:26.854
Butch it up, Mary.

10:26.856 --> 10:27.888
Got it.

10:27.890 --> 10:29.690
All right.

10:29.692 --> 10:31.992
I talked to a fella that
can get that bra off her

10:31.994 --> 10:33.693
without no questions asked.

10:33.695 --> 10:34.895
He's a little bit dangerous,

10:34.897 --> 10:36.596
but he owes me one

10:36.598 --> 10:38.198
'cause I taught his kids ballet.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.333
Oh.
Ah. There's a lot of

10:39.335 --> 10:40.634
curious information
in that statement.

10:40.636 --> 10:43.037
If anybody found out
that I lost that bra,

10:43.039 --> 10:44.571
I'm gonna get demoted
to that Best Buy guy

10:44.573 --> 10:45.806
who arbitrarily

10:45.808 --> 10:46.874
writes some squiggly line

10:46.876 --> 10:47.842
on them receipts.

10:47.844 --> 10:48.844
Look, you guys, it's okay.

10:48.845 --> 10:50.011
You can stop trying to hide it.

10:50.013 --> 10:51.179
I know why we're not shooting.

10:51.181 --> 10:52.780
It's-It's not
entirely our fault.

10:52.782 --> 10:54.682
Of course not,
it's entirely my fault.

10:54.684 --> 10:57.352
I haven't won the
models' respect yet.

10:57.354 --> 10:59.054
I mean, it's high school
all over again

10:59.056 --> 11:01.122
with those damn cheerleaders.
But I dominated them.

11:01.124 --> 11:02.824
And how did I do that?

11:02.826 --> 11:04.326
Joined the debate team.
Joined the debate team.

11:04.328 --> 11:06.695
Exactly.
I beat those bitches with words.

11:06.697 --> 11:09.598
"Beauty fades, brains stay."
That was our motto.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.467
We came in second in district.
Holla!

11:12.503 --> 11:14.169
Hey, I feel better.
Good talk, Sydney.

11:14.171 --> 11:15.638
Okay, let's get shooting.
Where's the bra?

11:15.640 --> 11:17.106
We don't have it.
We're polishing it.

11:17.108 --> 11:18.107
Really?

11:18.109 --> 11:19.674
Snitches get stitches!

11:19.676 --> 11:21.276
What do you mean,
you don't have it?

11:21.278 --> 11:22.310
Where-Where is it?

11:22.312 --> 11:24.012
Go away!

11:25.081 --> 11:27.082
I think that only works once.

11:27.984 --> 11:29.217
Just throw a shoe at it.

11:29.219 --> 11:30.452
I'm running low on macho.

11:30.454 --> 11:31.921
I don't know what
to say. Who's that?

11:31.923 --> 11:33.122
Timothy is in a panic.

11:33.124 --> 11:35.091
A raccoon ran into the house,
and now it's

11:35.093 --> 11:36.827
in the kitchen stalking
the Italian wedding soup.

11:36.829 --> 11:38.729
Don't let him near that pot.
Raccoons overseason everything.

11:38.731 --> 11:40.363
Okay, listen,
don't let him eat the soup.

11:40.365 --> 11:42.132
But-But shoo him out
with the broom.

11:42.134 --> 11:44.801
I... I don't know where
the broom is. Call Rosa!

11:44.803 --> 11:46.403
You should go.
I can handle this.

11:46.405 --> 11:49.039
No, he's a crisis queen.
There's no raccoon.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.474
No raccoon.

11:51.476 --> 11:52.876
That's a raccoon.
A raccoon.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.111
But, you know, it looks

11:54.113 --> 11:56.013
a lot more mischievous
than cruel, don't you think?

11:56.015 --> 11:57.581
It could be rabid, though.
You should go.

11:57.583 --> 11:59.583
Ah, it's big 'un.
No, no, I cannot leave.

11:59.585 --> 12:02.219
You don't want to leave me alone
with the clients, do you?

12:02.221 --> 12:03.254
You don't trust me.

12:03.256 --> 12:04.923
Of course, I trust you!

12:04.925 --> 12:06.991
How can I trust you?

12:06.993 --> 12:08.927
You're a wild card!
Thank you.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.763
It's not a compliment.
Really?

12:10.765 --> 12:12.798
No.
Oh...

12:12.800 --> 12:15.733
Where is this $10 million bra?

12:16.769 --> 12:19.070
It didn't just get up
and saunter away.

12:23.009 --> 12:24.409
Lauren, stop.

12:25.778 --> 12:27.980
Come to me.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.585
We're dead.

12:35.521 --> 12:37.855
Best Buy, here I come.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.593
"Raccoon nesting
in Gordie's slipper.

12:41.595 --> 12:42.927
Worried he'll never leave."

12:42.929 --> 12:44.696
Timothy's texting you now?

12:44.698 --> 12:45.797
Well, you deserted him.

12:45.799 --> 12:47.132
"Raccoon using spoon
with humanlike hand."

12:47.134 --> 12:48.533
You know what?
I don't like

12:48.535 --> 12:51.269
that you two are talking
behind my back. He's my partner.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.637
Maybe you should be
a better partner to him.

12:52.639 --> 12:54.372
Maybe you should
mind your own business.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.809
"Where is Gordie?" You see,
he's crying out for your help.

12:56.811 --> 12:58.911
You should go home and deal
with this raccoon crisis.

12:58.913 --> 13:00.513
Raccoon?
Oh, they're mean.

13:00.515 --> 13:01.747
Had a cousin once, got bit.

13:01.749 --> 13:03.215
His eyes foamed.

13:03.217 --> 13:05.117
See? Foaming eyes.

13:05.119 --> 13:06.352
Monsieur, you have
received a message.

13:06.354 --> 13:07.887
"Dinner is ruined.

13:07.889 --> 13:11.757
If I am dead when you get here,
know I died defending it."

13:11.759 --> 13:13.892
Uh-oh, sounds like
the missus is angry.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.993
Yeah, you know what?
They should save their drama

13:15.995 --> 13:17.127
for the soaps they watch.

13:17.129 --> 13:18.563
Am I right?
Amen!

13:18.565 --> 13:19.731
You're a monster.

13:19.733 --> 13:21.733
Guys, Gordon and I have
to go use the restroom.

13:21.735 --> 13:22.701
No, I don't.

13:22.703 --> 13:24.636
Yeah, you do.
Yeah, I do. Okay.

13:24.638 --> 13:25.804
Okay, easy.

13:27.373 --> 13:30.008
Boy, the little fellow's
stronger than he looks, huh?

13:30.010 --> 13:31.143
Feisty, isn't he?

13:31.145 --> 13:32.978
You know I don't like
when you snap at me

13:32.980 --> 13:34.346
in front of clients.
Just get in there.

13:34.348 --> 13:35.781
What are you doing?

13:37.083 --> 13:39.518
Do you know why
I'm wearing this tie?

13:39.520 --> 13:40.686
'Cause you don't own a mirror?

13:40.688 --> 13:43.056
25 years ago today,
you bought me this tie.

13:43.058 --> 13:45.725
Oh, yeah. For our first pitch.
Mm-hmm.

13:45.727 --> 13:47.260
The, uh, Progresso
Italian wedding soup.

13:47.262 --> 13:49.195
"I now pronounce you delizioso""

13:49.197 --> 13:51.731
Oh, so that's why Timothy's been
cooking Italian wedding soup.

13:51.733 --> 13:53.733
We were gonna celebrate
tonight with him.

13:53.735 --> 13:54.934
Timothy likes to be included.

13:54.936 --> 13:56.636
So this is why you're
upset with me...

13:56.638 --> 13:58.337
because I forgot our anniversary?
No, I'm upset

13:58.339 --> 14:00.473
because we've changed.
You know, back in the day,

14:00.475 --> 14:02.842
if we didn't like a client,
we didn't take 'em on.

14:02.844 --> 14:03.776
Want to go back in time?

14:03.778 --> 14:04.810
- Mmhmm.
- Step into my time machine.

14:04.812 --> 14:07.280
- Okay.
- We have no clients, right?

14:07.282 --> 14:08.814
We're eating bread sandwiches

14:08.816 --> 14:11.150
because we can't afford
dirt sandwiches.

14:11.152 --> 14:12.886
We're two idiots
with nothing to lose.

14:12.888 --> 14:15.055
But you know
what we weren't? Liars!

14:15.057 --> 14:16.557
We weren't ashamed
of who we were.

14:16.559 --> 14:18.459
I'm not ashamed of who I am.

14:18.461 --> 14:20.161
Really? Tell that
to the old ball and chain.

14:20.163 --> 14:21.996
Or, as you used to call him,
your swimming coach.

14:21.998 --> 14:23.430
Hold on a second.

14:23.432 --> 14:26.065
Speak of the devil.
I guess he's still alive,

14:26.067 --> 14:28.034
unless the raccoon's
pocket-dialing.

14:28.036 --> 14:29.101
Get out!

14:29.103 --> 14:30.636
I want to hear
what he has to say.

14:30.638 --> 14:32.038
No, no, you've lost your chance.
Easy.

14:32.040 --> 14:33.172
Just get the...!
You're hurting me.

14:33.174 --> 14:35.208
There's more where
that came from.

14:35.210 --> 14:36.877
- I can still see you.
- Get out!

14:42.749 --> 14:44.817
And Marvin's guy swears

14:44.819 --> 14:47.286
he can get Lauren out of the
bra as soon as he gets here.

14:47.288 --> 14:49.588
This is a remarkably stupid
predicament.

14:49.590 --> 14:51.890
This is, like,
Brady Bunch level stupid.

14:51.892 --> 14:53.959
As a fan of that show,
I should've known better.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.661
Adriana's leaving.

14:55.663 --> 14:58.530
So... go sit on her!

14:58.532 --> 15:00.799
I don't get paid
to sit on nobody.

15:00.801 --> 15:02.167
Fine.

15:04.470 --> 15:07.038
Adriana, look, you
need to put that...

15:07.040 --> 15:08.406
Whoa. Is that Chanel?

15:08.408 --> 15:09.942
- That is lovely.
- Thank you.

15:09.944 --> 15:12.411
Put that bag back down, please.

15:12.413 --> 15:15.414
Sorry, but you kept me waiting
all day long.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.589
Wait, Adriana, you cannot
get on that elevator!

15:23.591 --> 15:25.591
- We have you for another hour!
- Good-bye.

15:25.593 --> 15:27.126
Didn't you read your contract?

15:27.928 --> 15:29.862
I mean, if you even can read!

15:31.765 --> 15:34.066
What are you saying, tiny lady?

15:34.068 --> 15:36.568
Because I'm a model,
I'm illiterate?

15:36.570 --> 15:38.537
I'm the head
of the Model Book Club.

15:38.539 --> 15:40.005
Model Book Club?

15:41.374 --> 15:42.942
Prove it.

15:45.945 --> 15:49.182
Well, when I think of Kafka's
The Metamorphosis,

15:49.184 --> 15:51.350
two words spring to mind:

15:51.352 --> 15:53.085
"transformative identity."

15:53.087 --> 15:57.556
Yes, the cockroach represents
the ugliness of humanity

15:57.558 --> 16:00.258
surrounded by the
beauty of free will.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.560
Exactly. Sydney,
what do you think

16:02.562 --> 16:05.196
about the final state
of the cockroach?

16:09.067 --> 16:12.737
I'll tell you this much
about the cockroach.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.672
It bugged me. Holla!

16:14.674 --> 16:16.942
But you say you read the book.

16:16.944 --> 16:19.945
I guess I-I missed this one.

16:19.947 --> 16:21.913
I read all of Kafka's
other works.

16:21.915 --> 16:23.281
Name one.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.917
Da Vinci Code?

16:25.919 --> 16:28.453
You're out of Model Book Club!
Damn it!

16:31.758 --> 16:32.990
So, Gordon, where's that

16:32.992 --> 16:34.292
excible little
partner of yours?

16:34.294 --> 16:36.160
Oh, he has some
important business.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.162
Holy cow, high-maintenance,
that one, huh?

16:38.164 --> 16:39.497
It's like having two wives.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.967
Must be everything you can do
to keep him in line, huh?

16:41.969 --> 16:43.602
No, no, not really.
I try not to manage him, so...

16:43.604 --> 16:45.170
Maybe you should start, hmm?

16:45.172 --> 16:46.805
Keep him from wearing
those ugly ties.

16:48.075 --> 16:49.208
Yeah, super ugly!

16:49.210 --> 16:51.543
What-what, he lose
a bet or something?

16:51.545 --> 16:53.478
Hey, you know what?

16:53.480 --> 16:55.581
Just for the record,
I love that tie.

16:55.583 --> 16:56.615
I think it's a great tie.

16:56.617 --> 16:59.151
And I think Simon Roberts
is a great man.

16:59.153 --> 17:00.419
Been on a call. I'm sorry.

17:00.421 --> 17:01.621
No, I'm sorry!

17:01.623 --> 17:02.722
I've been a horrible partner.

17:02.724 --> 17:04.690
I've been ignoring your needs,

17:04.692 --> 17:06.459
and I've been putting
the client before you.

17:06.461 --> 17:08.227
Well, not anymore... because
from this moment on,

17:08.229 --> 17:09.896
I am recommitting myself.

17:09.897 --> 17:11.263
You and I are going to be

17:11.266 --> 17:14.367
partners forever,
the way it used to be.

17:14.368 --> 17:15.635
I want that, too, Gordie!

17:15.637 --> 17:17.636
- He's still on the line.
- Yeah, I got that.

17:17.637 --> 17:18.938
Timothy?

17:18.940 --> 17:20.372
Okay, stop crying.

17:20.374 --> 17:22.773
You know what? You cry.

17:22.776 --> 17:25.010
- Let him cry.
- You be who you are, okay?

17:25.012 --> 17:26.645
You cry all you want.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.548
He loves you, too.

17:29.350 --> 17:30.617
Yeah, I sure will.

17:30.619 --> 17:33.453
This is from Timothy,
you big lug.

17:33.455 --> 17:34.654
Oh...

17:34.656 --> 17:36.856
From me, too.
I love you, big guy.

17:36.858 --> 17:38.091
Love you, too.

17:38.093 --> 17:39.592
Did I just make this weird?

17:39.594 --> 17:41.360
No, I think we were
already there.

17:41.362 --> 17:42.561
Ah. Uh-huh.
Okay.

17:42.563 --> 17:44.630
So, I guess we're
done here, huh?

17:44.632 --> 17:46.932
No! No, no, no, no.

17:46.934 --> 17:49.301
Your personal business
is your personal business.

17:49.303 --> 17:50.602
Yeah, yeah, I mean,
you're going to hell.

17:50.604 --> 17:52.471
Oh, you're definitely
going to hell.

17:52.473 --> 17:53.906
But so's every other
agency we've been to.

17:53.908 --> 17:55.374
Sure.

17:55.376 --> 17:57.809
So, if we gotta pick
the best of the worst...

17:57.811 --> 17:59.945
Might as well be them.

17:59.947 --> 18:02.215
So, you fruitcakes
want to sell some pies?

18:03.551 --> 18:06.620
Why is the pencil wiggling?

18:06.622 --> 18:08.254
That's just an optical illusion.

18:08.256 --> 18:09.488
Not real magic.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.460
It's the end of the road, pal.

18:14.462 --> 18:16.061
I've lost my touch.
I'm no one.

18:16.063 --> 18:17.229
Oh, stop it.

18:17.231 --> 18:19.331
By the morning, the
models will all be gone

18:19.333 --> 18:20.866
and you'll be back
to one-night stands,

18:20.868 --> 18:22.301
making out and
popping off bras.

18:22.303 --> 18:24.270
What did you just say?

18:24.272 --> 18:27.039
Making out and
popping off br...

18:27.908 --> 18:29.742
Why are you looking
at me like that?

18:29.744 --> 18:31.009
Okay, I can do this,

18:31.011 --> 18:32.344
but we have to make out first.

18:32.346 --> 18:33.778
That's how I've always gotten
bras off before.

18:33.780 --> 18:34.846
Yeah, muscle memory.
That's plausible.

18:34.848 --> 18:36.181
Unless you're not cool with it.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.816
Because I know that we're in
a non-hooking-up phase.

18:37.818 --> 18:39.250
Just do it!
Okay.

18:41.487 --> 18:43.154
Oh. Remember the bra.

18:47.359 --> 18:49.527
The models are leaving!

18:49.529 --> 18:51.129
What's taking so long?
In ten...

18:51.131 --> 18:53.097
The bra, the bra!
It's not working!

18:53.099 --> 18:55.199
.nine, eight...
Cool heads, calm hands.

18:55.201 --> 18:56.634
Should I undo the red or the blue first?
...seven...

18:56.636 --> 18:58.403
The red or the blue? The red.
No... six...

18:58.405 --> 18:59.771
five, four...
I'm not sure!

18:59.773 --> 19:01.873
Oh, no! Do the red!
...three...

19:01.875 --> 19:03.508
Just do the red!
...two...

19:03.510 --> 19:05.310
one!
Pop it!

19:06.347 --> 19:08.113
Now, that's magic.

19:08.115 --> 19:10.048
Oh, give that to me!
Ta-da!

19:10.050 --> 19:11.616
Okay, we got it!

19:11.618 --> 19:13.452
Let's do this.

19:13.454 --> 19:15.354
And if I say no?

19:15.356 --> 19:18.124
Then you won't get
to wear this scarf!

19:18.126 --> 19:20.326
Oh, my gosh!
Where do they come from?

19:20.328 --> 19:22.428
I love this trick!

19:22.430 --> 19:23.529
Magic!

19:23.531 --> 19:24.764
All right, ladies.

19:24.766 --> 19:25.998
Look, I may not be

19:26.000 --> 19:30.468
as freakishly tall as you

19:30.470 --> 19:32.003
but I write the checks
around here.

19:32.005 --> 19:33.338
So purses down,

19:33.340 --> 19:35.674
bras out,
and let's shoot this mother.

19:35.676 --> 19:39.244
♪ Your feelings change
like the weather ♪

19:39.246 --> 19:44.216
♪ Went from clear to gray
on that cloudy day ♪

19:44.218 --> 19:47.919
♪ How can I go on
with that bomb in the palm? ♪

19:47.921 --> 19:51.155
♪ Love's so hard to find
when someone's on your mind ♪

19:51.157 --> 19:53.491
♪ Listen, baby... ♪

19:53.493 --> 19:55.793
I see we came
at the right time.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.262
Everything go okay?

19:57.264 --> 19:59.664
Easy. No problems at all.
How was lunch?

19:59.666 --> 20:00.965
Fantastic, smooth sailing.

20:00.967 --> 20:03.868
I'm lying. I briefly lost
the $10 million bra

20:03.870 --> 20:05.604
and the models
made me feel stupid.

20:05.606 --> 20:07.372
It was the worst day of my life.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.374
Well, your father told
the clients to go to hell,

20:09.376 --> 20:11.310
and then he set the lobsters
free in the restaurant.

20:11.312 --> 20:12.677
They made it as far
as the dog park,

20:12.679 --> 20:14.012
and then things got ugly.

20:14.014 --> 20:15.613
Oh, here's an unlikely
turn of events.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.447
Hmm? Timothy wants
to keep the raccoon.

20:17.449 --> 20:18.849
Oh, that's sweet.

20:20.585 --> 20:22.619
How big you think
they make those wings?

20:22.621 --> 20:25.555
Come on. You'd look like
a big, gay hummingbird.

20:26.641 --> 20:31.862

20:31.864 --> 20:35.132
That is a raccoon.
That's a big 'un, yeah.

20:35.134 --> 20:36.934
- Listen, that's okay.
- I'm sorry. Let me go back.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.436
That's okay.
Yeah, he's going back.

20:39.438 --> 20:41.470
- Believe me,
he's meaner. - Okay.

20:47.298 --> 20:48.255
I can't get out.
