00:01.335 --> 00:03.304
Previously on This Is Us...

00:03.337 --> 00:05.973
NICKY: You can be nice to them
all you want, Jack.

00:06.006 --> 00:08.109
But they're not just women
and children.

00:08.142 --> 00:10.010
They're the enemy.

00:10.044 --> 00:14.182
I had a brother...
he died in the war.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.450
I went to a database
for the war memorial.

00:16.484 --> 00:18.952
Nicholas Pearson,
he might be dead,

00:18.986 --> 00:20.754
but he didn't die here
in Vietnam.

00:20.788 --> 00:24.192
"Jack, last one. C.K."

00:24.225 --> 00:26.860
KEVIN:
My dad knew he was alive.

00:26.894 --> 00:28.729
Well, there's a return address.

00:28.762 --> 00:32.366
Bradford, Pennsylvania.
You think he's still there?

00:38.172 --> 00:40.174
(phone ringing in distance)

00:47.215 --> 00:50.050
Thanks, Ken.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.044
(indistinct chatter)

01:51.078 --> 01:53.013
-I call the TV.
-No, no, no, no.

01:53.046 --> 01:54.282
-REBECCA: Hi.
-JACK: Hey.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.984
-What?
-Uh, no, no, no. Homework first.

01:57.017 --> 01:59.287
-No TV.
-What about her?

01:59.320 --> 02:01.555
-I finished.
-JACK: Hey, guys, come on.

02:01.589 --> 02:03.757
Gear up in your rooms,
and then do greater Pittsburgh

02:03.791 --> 02:05.393
-a favor and shower, please.
-Hi.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.060
Hi.

02:07.094 --> 02:08.629
Thank you for picking them up
from practice.

02:08.662 --> 02:11.899
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here to serve.
(chuckles)

02:11.932 --> 02:14.635
(TV plays indistinctly)

02:19.006 --> 02:21.041
(laughter on TV)

02:24.111 --> 02:28.282
Hey, so I got to go out of town
for work tomorrow.

02:28.316 --> 02:30.451
-On a Saturday?
-Yeah.

02:30.484 --> 02:34.322
We've got a... a lumberyard
we're contracting up in Trenton.

02:34.355 --> 02:36.224
It's kind of important
that I'm there.

02:36.257 --> 02:39.793
-Okay.
-Okay.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.795
I'm gonna go upstairs
and change.

02:41.829 --> 02:44.265
I'll be right back down.

03:01.081 --> 03:04.017
KATE (on computer): Wait. You're
saying our uncle is still alive?

03:04.051 --> 03:05.185
Okay, that can't be true.

03:05.219 --> 03:06.887
Nicky died in Vietnam.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.422
Randall, didn't you
and Dad visit

03:08.456 --> 03:09.957
the memorial in high school?

03:09.990 --> 03:11.559
Wasn't his brother's name
on the wall?

03:11.592 --> 03:13.861
He said it was too hard for him.

03:13.894 --> 03:16.029
-KATE: Mom.
-I-I'm just hearing all this

03:16.063 --> 03:17.631
for the first time, too.

03:17.665 --> 03:19.600
Well, maybe Dad, uh,
maybe he didn't know.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.201
-Maybe he just was...
-KEVIN: He knew.

03:21.235 --> 03:24.605
He knew. I found a postcard
that Nicky sent him.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.940
It was dated 1992.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.909
(mimics explosion)

03:28.942 --> 03:30.878
Mind completely blown.

03:30.911 --> 03:33.314
I know this is really hard
for everyone to hear

03:33.347 --> 03:35.916
-because it means, well,
Dad wasn't telling us the...
-(sighs)

03:37.918 --> 03:41.489
Bradford is a six-hour drive
from here.

03:41.522 --> 03:43.957
I don't have a phone number,
but I have an address.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.726
And guess what.
As of 2017,

03:45.759 --> 03:49.196
there was a Nicholas Pearson
living there.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.064
-(mimics explosion)
-Randall.

03:51.098 --> 03:53.066
Whoever wants to come on
this trip with me,

03:53.100 --> 03:55.536
-you're more than welcome.
-RANDALL: All right.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.170
I'm not getting sworn in
for another eight weeks.

03:57.204 --> 03:59.673
Beth has a bunch
of job interviews coming up.

03:59.707 --> 04:02.343
As long as I can get somebody
to watch the girls, I'm in.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.512
(grunts) Yes, he's in. Okay.

04:04.545 --> 04:07.381
Mom? Kate?

04:07.415 --> 04:10.050
You want to join our, uh,
our little road movie?

04:10.083 --> 04:11.652
It'll be fun. It'll be like
Butch and Sundance

04:11.685 --> 04:13.587
and Thelma and Louise.
A-And you can pick

04:13.621 --> 04:15.055
whatever character you want;
doesn't matter to me.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.524
I'm not locked into one
in particular.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.659
I'm totally fluid on that.

04:18.692 --> 04:19.927
(quietly):
I'm Sundance.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.261
-I know you are. Yeah.
-Yeah.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.431
No. But I will,

04:23.464 --> 04:27.200
I will watch the girls for you,
okay?

04:27.234 --> 04:29.069
Mom.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.442
You know what? I...
I can't.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.043
I'm 2,500 miles away
and I'm pregnant.

04:36.076 --> 04:39.380
Kate, Dad's brother
may be alive.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.382
Don't you want to know
who he is?

04:41.415 --> 04:43.283
Guys, I'm out. Gotta go.

04:43.317 --> 04:44.485
-You know what that means.
-Hmm?

04:44.518 --> 04:45.653
Butch and Sundan...

04:56.530 --> 04:58.499
Hey, baby, have you seen
my cashmere heather V?

04:58.532 --> 05:00.734
The one that goes perfectly
with my uncle-hunter jeans?

05:02.436 --> 05:03.504
What's wrong?

05:03.537 --> 05:05.473
Uh, everything about
that sentence, baby.

05:05.506 --> 05:08.108
-Ah.
-But, um, also,

05:08.141 --> 05:10.378
feeling kind of nervous
about these interviews tomorrow.

05:10.411 --> 05:13.013
You're nervous?
Child, please.

05:13.046 --> 05:15.282
If anything, those companies
should be nervous to meet you.

05:15.315 --> 05:19.720
Because one of them is about
to win the Beth Pearson lottery.

05:19.753 --> 05:23.023
Why would they be nervous to win
the Beth Pearson lottery?

05:23.056 --> 05:25.959
I don't know.
It sounded cuter in my head.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.829
Uh, job interview pep talk,
take two.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.464
Beth Pearson,

05:30.498 --> 05:33.000
you are the ultimate prize hire.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.536
You're gonna walk
into those firms tomorrow

05:35.569 --> 05:37.270
with your brilliant-ass mind

05:37.304 --> 05:39.272
and that impressive-ass ambition

05:39.306 --> 05:41.575
and those spiky-ass heels,
and they gonna be like,

05:41.609 --> 05:43.977
"Beth Pearson, what we got
to do to get your actual ass

05:44.011 --> 05:46.113
in this building, Beth Pearson?"

05:46.146 --> 05:48.148
And, yes, I emphasize
the Beth Pearson,

05:48.181 --> 05:51.852
because it's more than just
a name, it is an attitude.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.454
An attitude that screams,

05:53.487 --> 05:56.189
"You know you want to hire me."

05:56.223 --> 05:58.291
All right,
I like take two better.

05:58.325 --> 05:59.627
Thank you very much.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.194
Your mom and Miguel

06:01.228 --> 06:02.696
are gonna stay over, right?

06:02.730 --> 06:05.766
Because I am going to go
to dinner with Zoe

06:05.799 --> 06:07.968
to blow off
some post-interview steam.

06:08.001 --> 06:09.637
And by dinner I mean Scotch.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.639
Yeah, they're in.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.974
What about you?

06:14.007 --> 06:15.709
You stressed
about what could happen

06:15.743 --> 06:17.845
when you meet
your long lost uncle?

06:17.878 --> 06:20.347
Honestly, I'm more stressed

06:20.380 --> 06:22.182
about what's gonna happen
if we don't meet him.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.851
Babe, when I was looking
for William,

06:23.884 --> 06:25.719
the only thing
I could think about

06:25.753 --> 06:28.989
was what I was gonna find if
I ever got to knock on his door.

06:29.022 --> 06:32.292
Like, would he look like me?

06:32.325 --> 06:34.161
Would he hug me?

06:34.194 --> 06:36.096
Would he slam the door
in my face?

06:36.129 --> 06:40.333
But the worst version
I could ever imagine

06:40.367 --> 06:43.036
is what would happen if no one
ever answered the door.

06:44.738 --> 06:48.576
And I think that's what's gonna
happen to Kevin.

06:48.609 --> 06:52.112
-So I got to be there for him.
-(phone chimes)

06:55.449 --> 06:57.384
Well, well.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.887
Look at that.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.388
What?

07:03.190 --> 07:05.358
KEVIN:
Hello. There she is.

07:05.392 --> 07:07.127
Sibling road trip, here we go.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.229
Thelma's in the house.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.068
-Get my bag for me.
-For the road.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.203
-Oh.
-Turkey and roast beef

07:16.236 --> 07:17.938
on pimento and an apple.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.240
God, I love your lunches.
Bye-bye.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.876
* It ain't no use to sit
and wonder why *

07:22.910 --> 07:25.779
Regulators, let's ride.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.380
-* If you don't know by now
-Thanks, Mom.

07:27.414 --> 07:29.617
All right. I'll be back
before you guys know it.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.451
-Bye, Dad.
-You're gonna be in time

07:31.485 --> 07:33.020
-for my game tomorrow, right?
-Yes, I will. I will be there.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.555
REBECCA:
He's only going to Trenton.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.657
* It'll never do somehow

07:36.690 --> 07:39.259
-Where's your brother?
-In there.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.328
JACK: Hey, Kev, you're not gonna
say good-bye?

07:41.361 --> 07:42.996
Good-bye.

07:43.030 --> 07:46.099
* Look out your window
and I'll be gone *

07:46.133 --> 07:50.137
* You're the reason
I'm travelin' on *

07:50.170 --> 07:52.940
* Well, don't think twice

07:52.973 --> 07:54.975
* It's all right

07:55.008 --> 07:57.678
Mom.

07:57.711 --> 08:01.649
* Ain't no use in turnin'
on your light, babe *

08:01.682 --> 08:04.484
* The light I never knowed

08:04.518 --> 08:06.486
Love you.

08:06.520 --> 08:11.391
* Ain't no use in turnin' on
your light, babe *

08:11.424 --> 08:14.695
* I'm on the dark side
of the road *

08:14.728 --> 08:19.833
* But I wish there was something
you would do or say *

08:19.867 --> 08:23.637
* To try and make me change
my mind and stay *

08:23.671 --> 08:28.075
* We never did
too much talkin', anyway *

08:28.108 --> 08:31.779
* Don't think twice,
it's all right. *

08:31.812 --> 08:35.583
This is... crazy.
Right?

08:35.616 --> 08:39.019
I mean, months and months of
searching, and here we are, huh?

08:39.052 --> 08:41.488
Road trippin'!
The Big Three,

08:41.521 --> 08:43.523
about ready to unlock
the great mystery of our uncle.

08:43.557 --> 08:45.025
I'm gonna need to pee soon.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.694
Pee? We've been on--

08:46.727 --> 08:47.895
It's like 12 and a half minutes
we've been driving.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.863
Okay, well, I'm pregnant,
and I pee a lot,

08:49.897 --> 08:51.064
so you just have
to deal with it.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.566
I've got road trip snacks
available

08:52.600 --> 08:53.634
whenever anybody wants them.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.904
Lots of nuts and seeds,
many pitted fruits.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.172
-I'm good.
-Randall?

08:59.206 --> 09:00.908
Yeah?

09:00.941 --> 09:02.209
You give away pennies
on Halloween, don't you?

09:02.242 --> 09:03.677
-(Kate laughs)
-Be honest with me.

09:03.711 --> 09:05.312
-Full-size candy bars,
for the record.
-Yeah?

09:05.345 --> 09:07.948
-Yeah. Only house on the block.
-Tell the truth, it's raisins.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.550
-It's healthy raisins.
-Handful of raisins.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.185
(laughter)

09:12.219 --> 09:13.353
You know, remember,
I live in a house

09:13.386 --> 09:15.388
with four very willful
and opinionated women,

09:15.422 --> 09:17.290
so I'm impervious
to your mocking.

09:23.731 --> 09:25.666
So, how old would Dad's
brother be now?

09:25.699 --> 09:27.500
Seventy.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.371
I wonder why Dad told us
his brother was dead.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.473
-I don't know.
-Mm.

09:33.506 --> 09:35.275
But we're about to embark
on some Shakespearean-level

09:35.308 --> 09:36.276
tragedy, I'm afraid.

09:36.309 --> 09:40.748
How are you so...
cool about this?

09:40.781 --> 09:42.750
Dad basically lied to us
his entire life,

09:42.783 --> 09:45.552
-a-and it doesn't freak you out?
-Not really.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.254
When you find out your mom's
been lying to you

09:47.287 --> 09:48.689
about your birth father
for 36 years,

09:48.722 --> 09:49.757
not much can rattle you
after that.

09:49.790 --> 09:53.593
* I just want
to stay here now... *

09:53.627 --> 09:55.428
I think this is really
rocking Mom's world

09:55.462 --> 09:56.563
to hear all this stuff
about Dad.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.169
ANNIE:
That smells so good.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.204
Do you think Dad will
bring Nicky home,

10:04.237 --> 10:05.939
like he brought home
Grandpa William?

10:05.973 --> 10:07.941
(chuckles)

10:07.975 --> 10:09.910
No, I don't think so, honey.

10:09.943 --> 10:13.280
He sure likes bringing people
home, though. Just sayin'.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.782
(Miguel chuckles)

10:14.815 --> 10:16.850
Hey, Tess,

10:16.884 --> 10:18.551
hit me with some
chocolate chips, would you?

10:18.585 --> 10:21.088
Here you go.
Excuse me.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.594
Is Grandma okay?

10:27.627 --> 10:29.562
Yeah, Grandma's just
a little tired.

10:29.596 --> 10:31.298
All right, let's get
this dough going in the oven

10:31.331 --> 10:34.401
before I eat that raw.
Teaspoon.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.153
YOUNG NICKY:
Hey, Jack.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.922
I'm going
to live in a big house

10:54.955 --> 10:57.090
on a lake someday.

10:57.124 --> 10:58.591
It's gonna have a dock
for my boat.

10:58.625 --> 10:59.893
Oh, yeah?

10:59.927 --> 11:01.328
I think you got to be rich

11:01.361 --> 11:03.596
to have a house
and a boat on a lake.

11:03.630 --> 11:05.766
I will be.
I'm going to be a doctor.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.500
Maybe a surgeon.

11:07.534 --> 11:09.136
JACK:
You're smart enough.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.604
Floyd Morton's dad is a surgeon,
and he's pretty rich.

11:11.638 --> 11:13.807
I need to get really rich,
though,

11:13.841 --> 11:15.142
not pretty rich.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.877
Dang, Nicky.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.645
How many boats do you need?

11:18.678 --> 11:19.980
Just one.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.681
Two houses, though.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.887
Big ol' houses
on a big ol' lake.

11:26.920 --> 11:30.023
YOUNG NICKY: Big ol' houses
on a big ol' lake.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.701
Well, we doing this or not?

11:49.743 --> 11:52.645
(birds chirping)

12:01.588 --> 12:05.425
How'd you get my home address?

12:10.463 --> 12:11.965
Come on.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.500
I don't think he's there,
Sundance.

12:13.533 --> 12:15.335
Yeah. Kev, hey, we tried.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.237
Okay? It wasn't meant to be.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.272
And we should go,
'cause I have to pee.

12:20.373 --> 12:21.574
JACK:
You can't

12:21.608 --> 12:22.810
write me at home.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.044
Got it?

12:24.077 --> 12:25.678
(chuckles)

12:25.712 --> 12:28.181
You drove all the way
from Pittsburgh to tell me that?

12:28.215 --> 12:30.818
That's how much I mean it.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.056
(keys jangle)

12:36.089 --> 12:38.926
Take care.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.494
Oh, really? Wonderful.
You're breaking in?

12:41.528 --> 12:43.563
I'm not breaking in. I'm trying
to see if anyone lives here.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.866
NICKY:
Somebody does.

12:51.238 --> 12:53.440
Nicholas Pearson?

12:54.474 --> 12:55.976
Yeah.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.716
I'm Kevin Pearson.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.552
I'm, uh...

13:07.287 --> 13:09.289
I'm Jack Pearson's son.

13:11.624 --> 13:12.559
You want a beer?

13:13.593 --> 13:16.563
I don't drink anymore.

13:18.866 --> 13:21.568
I got Nesquik.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.144
Jack know you're here?

13:32.345 --> 13:34.347
He's dead.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.118
Dead.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.619
When'd he pass?

13:39.652 --> 13:41.621
1998.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.624
(quietly):
'98.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.493
(muttering)

13:56.904 --> 13:58.838
(lock clicks)

14:04.945 --> 14:07.347
You coming in or not?

14:18.858 --> 14:20.827
Mmm.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.930
I got some Fritos, also,
if you're hungry.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.597
No, I'm...

14:24.631 --> 14:25.865
That'll be fine.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.568
(grunts)

14:33.907 --> 14:35.875
You know,

14:35.909 --> 14:37.911
I had a house once.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.181
But this is better.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.516
It's much more manageable.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.719
Mm.

14:46.753 --> 14:50.257
I, uh, have something for you.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.630
(inhales)

14:57.664 --> 15:00.033
(blows smoke out)

15:01.901 --> 15:03.836
I thought maybe you'd want them.

15:12.345 --> 15:15.315
Good men.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.623
Sorry.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.392
It's a bad habit.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.394
One of many.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.729
Mm. Jesus.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.898
Nicky, how do you screw up
chocolate milk?

15:31.931 --> 15:34.301
(grunts)

15:34.334 --> 15:37.204
Well, it can't be as bad
as Mom's chili lasagna.

15:37.237 --> 15:38.405
Yeah.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.806
(chuckles)

15:39.839 --> 15:41.274
Remember when we tried

15:41.308 --> 15:43.076
feeding it
to Mrs. Atkins' collie?

15:43.110 --> 15:45.578
Oh, yeah.
Even Ms. Atkins' collie

15:45.612 --> 15:47.080
didn't want to eat that crap.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.781
No.
(laughs): Yeah.

15:48.815 --> 15:51.451
(laughing)

15:51.484 --> 15:53.286
Oh...

15:53.320 --> 15:54.587
(Nicky sighs)

15:54.621 --> 15:56.956
(chuckles)

16:08.501 --> 16:10.137
You diabetic?

16:16.709 --> 16:18.778
My brother's adopted.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.080
It's true.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.283
Explains why he's black.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.751
That's also true.

16:29.022 --> 16:31.624
Our dad told us
you died in Vietnam.

16:33.660 --> 16:34.661
Uh-huh.

16:37.064 --> 16:38.931
Seems you didn't.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.834
Uh-uh.

16:45.438 --> 16:46.806
Oh, come on.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.175
(clattering)

16:48.208 --> 16:50.777
Sir, I know this
may be hard to talk about,

16:50.810 --> 16:53.180
but do you have any idea
why he might have told us that?

16:53.213 --> 16:54.281
(grunts)

16:54.314 --> 16:57.117
(panting)

16:57.150 --> 16:59.652
You wasted your time
coming here.

17:03.022 --> 17:06.893
Just-- please, leave.

17:09.096 --> 17:11.064
No.

17:12.132 --> 17:15.335
Sir, I didn't want to come here.

17:17.337 --> 17:19.139
And I didn't want to...

17:19.172 --> 17:21.007
find out these answers, but...

17:21.040 --> 17:23.176
my brother literally traveled
around the world and back

17:23.210 --> 17:24.511
to learn about our dad,

17:24.544 --> 17:25.612
and it's led him here.

17:25.645 --> 17:28.047
So we're not going anywhere.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.185
(chuckles)

17:32.219 --> 17:34.654
Yeah.

17:35.922 --> 17:39.692
You're Jack's kids, all right.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.671
(sighs)
I got drafted.

17:51.704 --> 17:57.043
Your father enlisted
to look for me.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.479
I was a medic

17:59.512 --> 18:02.482
who sampled his own inventory.

18:02.515 --> 18:05.518
I mean, I sampled
a lot of stuff.

18:05.552 --> 18:10.157
I mean,
whatever junk came my way.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.159
I, um...

18:12.192 --> 18:14.161
I hated the war.

18:14.194 --> 18:15.562
(sips)

18:15.595 --> 18:17.096
I hated myself.

18:17.130 --> 18:21.968
And your father tried
to clean me up. (scoffs)

18:23.636 --> 18:25.772
It didn't work.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.540
Finally, they, um,

18:27.574 --> 18:29.209
pulled me out of there

18:29.242 --> 18:31.944
for, uh, psychiatric reasons.

18:31.978 --> 18:34.381
You know, some get homesick.

18:34.414 --> 18:35.715
I got war-sick.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.817
(chuckling)

18:39.552 --> 18:42.222
Then why did Dad tell us
you died there?

18:45.625 --> 18:48.295
He should never have
come for me.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.736
He should never have come
for me.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.814
(pills rattle)

19:17.457 --> 19:19.859
(mimics gunshot)

19:25.031 --> 19:27.634
(chickens clucking)

19:27.667 --> 19:30.002
(rooster crowing)

19:32.104 --> 19:35.141
(yawns)

19:35.174 --> 19:38.345
(grunting)

19:38.378 --> 19:40.647
(dog barking in distance)

19:53.826 --> 19:55.828
(mooing in distance)

19:58.631 --> 20:00.633
(grunts)

20:12.211 --> 20:14.213
Mmm.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.092
Hmm?

20:26.125 --> 20:27.894
Mm.

20:30.430 --> 20:31.731
Hey. No.

20:39.005 --> 20:42.074
(laughing)

20:42.108 --> 20:44.511
(chuckling)

20:46.913 --> 20:49.282
(both laughing)

20:50.583 --> 20:52.585
(sniffs)

20:56.255 --> 20:58.224
Cam on, chú.

20:58.257 --> 21:01.461
Không có chi.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.641
Let's go fishing.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.721
Okay.

21:28.755 --> 21:31.324
I think we found our spot.
What do you think?

21:31.358 --> 21:34.126
Let's go fishing, huh?

21:34.160 --> 21:35.362
All right, now,

21:35.395 --> 21:37.129
see this?

21:37.163 --> 21:38.998
Secret weapon.

21:43.403 --> 21:45.472
Uh-huh. See?

21:45.505 --> 21:48.274
(pops lips, imitates explosion)

21:48.307 --> 21:49.776
(vocalizes, laughs)

21:49.809 --> 21:51.077
Okay.

21:52.111 --> 21:53.780
Watch this.

21:56.349 --> 21:58.150
Watch out.

21:58.184 --> 22:00.753
(both laugh)

22:02.121 --> 22:03.656
Holy mackerel.

22:03.690 --> 22:05.492
(whoops)

22:05.525 --> 22:07.560
All right!

22:07.594 --> 22:09.295
-Come to Papa, baby.
-(speaking Vietnamese)

22:09.328 --> 22:10.430
Oh, yeah, we did good.

22:10.463 --> 22:11.864
(laughs)

22:11.898 --> 22:13.400
Here.

22:13.433 --> 22:15.935
It's bigger than you.

22:15.968 --> 22:17.437
Yeah.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.439
(laughs)

22:19.472 --> 22:21.474
What do you think?

22:21.508 --> 22:24.310
Pretty good, right?
Go ahead. Toss him in.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.945
Oh, yeah.

22:25.978 --> 22:28.114
Dinner. Beautiful.

22:28.147 --> 22:30.016
Toss him in. Oh!

22:30.049 --> 22:31.551
Oh! Oh! Oh!

22:31.584 --> 22:33.453
Oh! Oh, oh, oh! There you go.

22:33.486 --> 22:35.321
There he is. Toss him in.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.356
I think we're good.

22:37.390 --> 22:39.692
What do you think,
should we go find another spot?

22:39.726 --> 22:42.695
All right, Captain.
Whatever you say.

22:42.729 --> 22:45.698
(sighs) Plenty more
where that came from, huh?

22:52.939 --> 22:56.275
Okay. I like this spot, too.

22:56.308 --> 22:58.177
What do you think?

22:58.210 --> 22:59.946
I think so. I feel it here.

22:59.979 --> 23:02.515
Okay.

23:03.516 --> 23:06.185
(speaking Vietnamese)

23:06.218 --> 23:09.556
No, no, no, no, no. No, no.

23:09.589 --> 23:10.990
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

23:11.023 --> 23:13.392
No, no, no!

23:14.694 --> 23:16.295
Watch out.

23:16.328 --> 23:18.230
Watch out! Get-get off the boat!

23:18.264 --> 23:20.867
Get off the boat!
Get off the boat!

23:20.900 --> 23:22.702
Off the boat! Off the boat!

23:24.904 --> 23:25.905
Jump!

23:28.407 --> 23:30.943
(explosion)

23:40.086 --> 23:42.589
-Murillo, what happened?
-A boat exploded.

23:42.622 --> 23:45.024
I think one of our guys
was on it.

23:57.236 --> 23:59.238
-(sound muted)
-(high-pitched ringing)

24:09.816 --> 24:13.052
(muted screaming)

24:15.121 --> 24:17.156
Sarge!

24:25.598 --> 24:28.267
Lanh. Lanh?

24:28.300 --> 24:30.202
Lanh? Lanh?!

24:30.236 --> 24:32.539
(screaming)

24:35.174 --> 24:37.043
Let's go. Go!

24:51.658 --> 24:53.526
-(sound muted)
-(high-pitched ringing)

24:53.560 --> 24:55.595
(speaking indistinctly)

25:09.809 --> 25:11.544
(inaudible)

25:13.112 --> 25:15.648
What did you do, huh?!
What did you do?!

25:15.682 --> 25:17.249
What did you do, Nicky?

25:17.283 --> 25:20.352
He was just a kid.

25:22.221 --> 25:23.556
He was just a kid.

25:25.725 --> 25:27.894
I'm done! I'm done!

25:36.569 --> 25:40.506
Lanh! Lanh!

25:40.539 --> 25:42.541
(sobbing):
Lanh!

25:46.012 --> 25:48.815
(speaking Vietnamese)

25:50.416 --> 25:52.418
I'm sorry.

26:01.861 --> 26:04.196
(screaming, sobbing)

26:28.254 --> 26:31.858
Shrinks will get his head
on straight, Sarge.

26:31.891 --> 26:35.327
Murillo, Boone,

26:35.361 --> 26:37.496
you guys are on the wire.

26:37.529 --> 26:39.431
Murphy, Townie,
the rest of you gear up.

26:39.465 --> 26:41.467
We're out at 0500.

27:02.321 --> 27:06.558
I never got to, um...

27:06.592 --> 27:09.228
(sighs)

27:09.261 --> 27:12.331
I never got to tell him.

27:14.633 --> 27:17.804
I never got to tell him.

27:25.344 --> 27:27.279
Then we built the curved
snowbank so we'd have

27:27.313 --> 27:28.748
-a bobsled turn.
-Oh, yeah.

27:28.781 --> 27:30.582
Yeah.

27:30.616 --> 27:34.186
Yeah, except the sled went
straight through the snowbank

27:34.220 --> 27:35.621
and almost onto
the Bellarmine Parkway.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.825
So much for
the Squaw Valley Olympics.

27:38.858 --> 27:41.828
-Yeah.
-(laughs)

27:51.771 --> 27:52.939
Jack...

27:52.972 --> 27:55.474
No. Nicky, no.

28:00.012 --> 28:04.817
No, I... I don't want
to go back there.

28:04.851 --> 28:07.653
I want to leave that
right where it is.

28:07.686 --> 28:11.057
You don't have to talk.
Just... listen.

28:14.761 --> 28:20.967
I've relived that day
so many times in my head.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.369
I-I-I didn't mean
for that boy...

28:23.402 --> 28:25.504
-Nicky...
-Just let me say...

28:25.537 --> 28:28.640
Just stop, stop.
I'm begging you, stop.

28:28.674 --> 28:30.676
Okay? No more.

28:30.709 --> 28:35.481
And-and stop... stop sending
letters to my house.

28:35.514 --> 28:38.851
I've got a wife and a family.
I moved on.

28:38.885 --> 28:42.688
I wish I was wired differently,
but I'm not. Okay?

28:42.721 --> 28:46.125
I-I can't just turn back.

28:57.203 --> 28:59.071
It's good to see you, Nick.

28:59.105 --> 29:01.307
Did I ruin your life?

29:07.880 --> 29:11.217
No, Nicky, I--

29:11.250 --> 29:12.819
I have a good life.

29:33.705 --> 29:35.707
Gosh.

29:35.741 --> 29:37.309
(chuckles)

29:40.813 --> 29:43.549
Your wife is beautiful.

29:43.582 --> 29:46.285
Yes, she is.

29:46.318 --> 29:49.288
Her name is Rebecca.

29:49.321 --> 29:52.825
And that's Kate,
Kevin and Randall.

29:52.859 --> 29:57.329
-Randall is a different color.
-Yes, he is.

29:57.363 --> 30:01.433
He found me.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.905
Mm.

30:14.780 --> 30:16.348
You have a nice house.

30:20.619 --> 30:24.456
So... yeah.

30:46.045 --> 30:49.415
I won't--
I won't write you anymore.

30:49.448 --> 30:52.184
You can go.

30:56.088 --> 30:58.991
-Nicky, I...
-Just go.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.874
(door closes)

31:27.886 --> 31:31.157
You know, and the women--
the Vietnamese women--

31:31.190 --> 31:35.661
um... when they, uh...
lost someone

31:35.694 --> 31:39.198
during that war,
they'd collapse.

31:39.231 --> 31:42.068
It's like their-their bones
were being pulled

31:42.101 --> 31:43.869
from their body.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.372
And, like...

31:46.405 --> 31:48.840
they'd fold into...

31:48.874 --> 31:51.277
someplace in themselves,
and, um,

31:51.310 --> 31:54.846
squat down and just wail.

31:54.880 --> 31:57.049
You'd just hear it, you know,

31:57.083 --> 31:59.518
over and over and over.

31:59.551 --> 32:01.653
Pure grief.

32:01.687 --> 32:05.057
Yeah. My, uh...

32:05.091 --> 32:07.593
my memory of the war--

32:07.626 --> 32:09.861
it fades a little bit every day.

32:11.230 --> 32:13.632
Except for that mother's face.

32:14.700 --> 32:17.769
She's with me, wailing.

32:19.738 --> 32:21.907
Um...

32:21.940 --> 32:25.611
I worry that that's gonna be
the last damn thing I remember

32:25.644 --> 32:27.646
when my time comes.

32:31.317 --> 32:35.254
You know, your old man--

32:35.287 --> 32:39.291
he saw everything
in black and white, no gray.

32:39.325 --> 32:43.062
It's... it's why
he had two lives.

32:43.095 --> 32:46.765
Uh, the one
before I ruined everything.

32:46.798 --> 32:49.068
The one after.

32:49.101 --> 32:52.038
And he...

32:52.071 --> 32:54.973
he walked away
from the first life.

32:57.576 --> 32:59.111
(car starts)

32:59.145 --> 33:02.448
And once
Jack picked a direction,

33:02.481 --> 33:05.951
he never changed course.

33:10.856 --> 33:12.758
(turn signal clicking)

33:12.791 --> 33:15.127
You know, he put

33:15.161 --> 33:17.329
the war behind him, and

33:17.363 --> 33:19.565
he never looked back.

33:21.433 --> 33:23.735
I wasn't so lucky.

33:32.644 --> 33:35.013
(signal clicking)

33:52.698 --> 33:55.301
How did he die?

34:00.172 --> 34:01.973
Uh...

34:02.007 --> 34:04.376
(clears throat)

34:04.410 --> 34:06.044
There was a fire.

34:09.415 --> 34:12.218
He got us out,
but he had a heart attack

34:12.251 --> 34:15.053
from smoke inhalation.

34:21.727 --> 34:23.162
(quietly):
Oh, damn.

34:26.265 --> 34:28.734
(sighs)

34:28.767 --> 34:32.871
You know, I'm feeling
a little worn down

34:32.904 --> 34:36.074
from all this reliving
of these happy memories,

34:36.108 --> 34:40.712
so, um... I think
I'm just gonna call it a day.

34:40.746 --> 34:44.150
-Sir...
-I'm going
to call it a day, son.

35:12.511 --> 35:13.945
(car door closes)

35:18.584 --> 35:20.819
(door closes)

35:24.790 --> 35:27.092
Hi.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.528
How was it?

35:32.331 --> 35:36.902
Bec, I didn't tell you the truth
about where I went today.

35:36.935 --> 35:39.905
Um...

35:39.938 --> 35:44.943
I went to go see someone,

35:44.976 --> 35:49.981
um, someone that I'd known
from the war.

35:50.015 --> 35:54.786
He'd been having a rough go
of things lately, and...

35:54.820 --> 36:00.158
m-mostly because of something
bad that happened there.

36:00.192 --> 36:02.928
Something he did.

36:02.961 --> 36:06.565
Um... and,

36:06.598 --> 36:09.368
well, we used to be close.

36:09.401 --> 36:13.505
And then we had a falling out
because of that.

36:13.539 --> 36:15.474
And he reached out,

36:15.507 --> 36:19.845
and I decided to go see him.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.417
Well, did it help?

36:30.021 --> 36:33.191
Yeah. A little.

36:33.225 --> 36:35.794
Maybe? I don't know.

36:37.896 --> 36:39.698
You know, there are people
that you can talk to...

36:39.731 --> 36:42.801
I'm gonna go clean up.

36:48.173 --> 36:50.709
Can't tell you
how good it is to be home.

37:01.587 --> 37:03.188
(water running)

37:03.221 --> 37:05.223
(dishes clinking)

37:23.041 --> 37:24.710
Kids are getting ready for bed,

37:24.743 --> 37:28.013
but I think after consuming
11 chocolate chip cookies,

37:28.046 --> 37:29.648
they're not gonna
sleep for a week.

37:29.681 --> 37:33.218
They found him.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.421
Jack's brother.

37:35.454 --> 37:38.056
Wow.

37:38.089 --> 37:41.527
I never thought th...
Well, tell me.

37:41.560 --> 37:45.196
I-I, I don't know, they just
texted that they found him.

37:45.230 --> 37:48.434
Details to follow.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.101
You okay?

37:52.438 --> 37:54.039
Could I have done more?

37:54.072 --> 37:55.674
You tried, Rebecca.

37:55.707 --> 37:57.075
No...
(sighs)

37:57.108 --> 37:58.710
When Jack first got
back from Vietnam,

37:58.744 --> 38:01.246
I understand why I respected
his privacy.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.248
The wounds were fresh.

38:03.281 --> 38:06.251
But all those years later, why?

38:06.284 --> 38:10.789
Why didn't I ask him more?

38:12.424 --> 38:16.795
You know, Jack was
my closest friend,

38:16.828 --> 38:22.133
for over 20 years, but I didn't
know him completely.

38:22.167 --> 38:24.770
Not the stuff from before.

38:24.803 --> 38:30.275
I think that there was
a darkness inside of him.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.478
I think that he was afraid.

38:32.511 --> 38:34.780
You know, if that darkness
got out, then,

38:34.813 --> 38:37.849
it might swallow up the light
that he got from you.

38:37.883 --> 38:40.151
From the kids.

38:40.185 --> 38:44.122
And make no mistake:

38:44.155 --> 38:46.157
you and the kids
were everything.

38:48.627 --> 38:51.229
I used to love that answer.

38:51.262 --> 38:55.934
'cause I wanted to believe it.

38:55.967 --> 38:57.969
But now?

39:02.608 --> 39:05.811
I want the truth.

39:13.852 --> 39:15.454
(sighs)
Okay.

39:15.487 --> 39:17.288
I got real road snacks.

39:17.322 --> 39:22.694
I got SweeTarts, protein bars,
jerky, smoked almonds, sodas

39:22.728 --> 39:24.530
and Ding effing Dongs.

39:24.563 --> 39:26.998
Now, leave me be.
Kate, did you urinate?

39:27.032 --> 39:31.236
-Yes.
-Kevin, you break it,
you bought it.

39:31.269 --> 39:33.472
-What's wrong?
-I want to go with you.

39:33.505 --> 39:35.474
I like you better
than all of them.

39:35.507 --> 39:37.843
Well, you shouldn't,
because they're pretty great.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.879
And trust me, there's plenty
your old man gets wrong.

39:40.912 --> 39:42.781
-Yeah, right.
-No, I do.

39:42.814 --> 39:47.686
Hey, look, y-you got
to watch out for that, bud,

39:47.719 --> 39:50.522
because a-a kid can either
repeat the mistakes

39:50.556 --> 39:53.391
of his old man,
or he corrects them.

39:53.425 --> 39:55.927
It's hard to explain, but, uh...

39:59.598 --> 40:04.269
Hey, chip in. Help your mom.

40:07.939 --> 40:11.643
That's no way to live, huh?

40:11.677 --> 40:14.480
All messed up, living alone
for 40-some-odd years

40:14.513 --> 40:16.548
in a leaky sardine can?

40:19.350 --> 40:22.320
I can't leave him like Dad did.

40:59.024 --> 41:01.026
KEVIN:
Nicky?

41:03.795 --> 41:06.397
Nicky!

41:32.023 --> 41:34.459
Everything okay in here?
You all right?

41:45.503 --> 41:49.007
I never got to tell him...

41:51.409 --> 41:54.045
...it was an accident.

42:14.600 --> 42:16.602
