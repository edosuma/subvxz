WEBVTT

00:04.000 --> 00:05.601
Previously on ER:

00:05.601 --> 00:07.971
- Are you loving motherhood?
- Yeah.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.930
- Oh, this isn't awkward?
- What ?

00:10.000 --> 00:11.892
That you and I are equals now?

00:11.900 --> 00:13.648
Dr. Crenshaw is our new chief resident.

00:13.648 --> 00:16.491
Neela Rasgotra.
Two years in the ER, then defected.

00:16.491 --> 00:18.995
It took you that long to figure out
you were wasting your time?

00:19.060 --> 00:20.464
- I'm your daddy.
- What's up?

00:20.464 --> 00:23.596
- How's the new intern doing?
- She's very, uh, devoted.

00:23.596 --> 00:25.720
- Thank you, Jesus.
- Were you the best one there?

00:25.724 --> 00:27.781
How many people did you save?

00:27.781 --> 00:28.840
Did you rock?

00:28.840 --> 00:30.552
Next time you don't do
what I tell you to do,

00:30.559 --> 00:32.552
or any other attending tells you to do,

00:32.604 --> 00:36.012
you're gonna find yourself getting
bum-rushed right out of this program.

00:41.858 --> 00:43.661
You don't even appreciate the fact
that I took the time

00:43.665 --> 00:46.060
and money to go out
and buy you some new clothes.

00:46.165 --> 00:47.851
I didn't ask you to do that.

00:47.856 --> 00:51.093
No, because you'd rather go to school
dressed like a bag lady.

00:51.097 --> 00:53.270
Would you rather
I dressed like a slut?!

00:53.278 --> 00:55.651
Because that's how most of
the other girls dress.

00:55.655 --> 01:00.160
I'd rather you dressed like someone
that has a mother that cares about her.

01:00.588 --> 01:03.610
- Tony, would you please say something?
- Good morning.

01:04.717 --> 01:07.053
What's wrong with the way I dress?

01:07.207 --> 01:09.250
She won't even try on the clothes
I bought for her.

01:09.256 --> 01:10.432
Those are nice.

01:10.505 --> 01:15.052
They're ugly, and I refuse to conform
to some anorexic,

01:15.057 --> 01:17.562
media-fueled ideal of beauty.

01:17.566 --> 01:21.790
That's fine, but you're not
leaving the house dressed like that.

01:24.125 --> 01:25.531
Tony?

01:29.427 --> 01:31.752
I hate living here!

01:34.505 --> 01:36.653
We never resolved the nanny issue.

01:36.656 --> 01:38.902
Do you really want someone else
raising our child?

01:38.908 --> 01:41.161
Well, I'm just talking
about a few hours a week

01:41.166 --> 01:43.010
so I can at least get
some stuff done around here.

01:43.015 --> 01:45.772
Oh, I thought we had agreed
to stagger our shifts.

01:45.777 --> 01:48.293
Well, and what, never see each other?

01:48.537 --> 01:50.651
I mean, even if that was practical,

01:50.658 --> 01:54.300
after your first day alone,
you'd be begging for help, trust me.

01:54.306 --> 01:56.750
Mm. I think I can handle it.

01:56.758 --> 02:00.100
Well, if you can handle it so well,
help me get Joe in the car, will you ?

02:00.107 --> 02:02.952
We're late for
our first Mommy and Baby class.

02:06.418 --> 02:07.492
What?

02:08.656 --> 02:09.821
Nothing.

02:11.005 --> 02:13.270
What?
I thought it would be fun for... What?

02:13.276 --> 02:15.290
I didn't say anything. What?

02:16.827 --> 02:19.200
I'm late for work. Bye.

02:19.807 --> 02:22.720
I'll call you later.
Don't forget his frog.

02:26.445 --> 02:28.502
I know.
Come here. Oh.

02:28.608 --> 02:31.963
Can you say "Daddy is a butthead," hmm?

02:32.567 --> 02:34.652
Why is your daddy a butthead?

02:37.498 --> 02:39.372
- I look like a dork.
- No, you don't.

02:39.407 --> 02:41.851
This is not my style, and this is not me.

02:41.858 --> 02:43.842
If you didn't like what your mother
bought you, ask her to go shopping.

02:43.877 --> 02:46.002
Then you guys buy something together.

02:48.608 --> 02:49.811
What are you doing?

02:49.907 --> 02:51.840
Damage control.

02:52.287 --> 02:53.511
- Sarah...
- What?

02:53.545 --> 02:56.803
- This is not cool.
- Do you mind? I'm changing.

02:58.358 --> 03:00.461
I hope your mother doesn't find out
about this.

03:00.465 --> 03:01.671
She won't.

03:02.705 --> 03:06.263
And besides, you don't know what it's
like for girls my age these days.

03:06.827 --> 03:09.390
There is a lot of pressure at school.

03:10.156 --> 03:13.451
What you wear, what you eat,
what you don't eat.

03:13.488 --> 03:15.521
- What's his name?
- Who ?

03:16.007 --> 03:17.930
This is obviously about a guy.

03:18.256 --> 03:20.122
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

03:22.185 --> 03:24.442
Maybe I should dress like a hussy.

03:24.807 --> 03:28.580
Maybe we should get you a plaid jacket.
We'll just tell everyone you're a lesbian.

03:33.798 --> 03:35.380
- Adam.
- Huh?

03:36.496 --> 03:39.520
Adam Horner,
but he doesn't even look at me.

03:39.528 --> 03:42.793
Well, good. I don't want some guy
named Horndog anywhere near you.

03:42.858 --> 03:44.362
It's Horner.

03:45.466 --> 03:48.921
Listen, most guys are jerks,
but if you want this guy...

03:48.925 --> 03:50.661
Okay, wait a minute.
You're a guy.

03:50.708 --> 03:53.202
Exactly, and if you want this guy
to notice you,

03:53.205 --> 03:55.030
forget about your clothes
and ignore him.

03:55.208 --> 03:56.931
- That's your advice?
- Yup.

03:59.206 --> 04:01.943
- Ignore him?
- Yup, that's right.

04:02.906 --> 04:05.403
Wow. You really suck at this.

04:05.475 --> 04:07.091
Trust me.
Most guys want what they can't have.

04:07.097 --> 04:09.571
You ignore him, that guy'll come
running to you, all right?

04:09.877 --> 04:12.131
Try not to kill anyone today.

04:14.406 --> 04:15.692
Bye.

04:18.386 --> 04:20.213
- He's out.
- All right. Hope...

04:20.267 --> 04:23.351
you're going to take a deep breath,
and you're going to hold it.

04:23.406 --> 04:27.143
Now, if you don't get the tube in
by the time you run out of air,

04:27.148 --> 04:28.800
we're gonna stop, and we're gonna bag.

04:28.805 --> 04:30.343
Okay? Are you ready?

04:30.737 --> 04:35.130
With you and Jesus guiding my hand,
I am.

04:35.808 --> 04:36.941
Right.

04:39.605 --> 04:43.261
Okay, sweep the tongue to the side and
advance until you're in the vallecula.

04:43.268 --> 04:45.973
Elevate the scope at a 45-degree angle.

04:46.508 --> 04:47.673
See the cords?

04:48.225 --> 04:50.640
All right, I'll give you some cricoid
pressure. How's that?

04:50.908 --> 04:53.691
Come on, Hope. The cords should be
right there. He's a young guy.

04:53.876 --> 04:56.590
All right, pull up more, but do not
rock back against the teeth.

04:56.598 --> 05:00.433
Aim the end of the handle to where
the wall meets the ceiling.

05:01.795 --> 05:04.760
Can you see the aryepiglottic folds?
Hello?!

05:06.805 --> 05:08.543
Sats are dropping. Pratt.

05:08.707 --> 05:12.250
Whoa. All right, pull out.
You bag, you breathe.

05:12.407 --> 05:14.521
I'm sorry... I ran...

05:15.015 --> 05:17.592
If you were doing what I told you to do,
you should have been able to pass the tube.

05:17.598 --> 05:19.272
- Come on.
- Maybe you should sit down.

05:19.305 --> 05:21.900
Yeah. I don't feel so good.

05:21.907 --> 05:23.530
Uh, I'm in.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:34.508 --> 05:37.350
- Here, that should keep you from swelling.
- Oh, bless you, Sam.

05:39.275 --> 05:40.383
What happened to her?

05:40.485 --> 05:42.800
- Nothing.
- Damn, it's only the morning test.

05:42.808 --> 05:44.870
What are you doing with the transport
beeper? I gave that to Jane.

05:44.875 --> 05:46.923
You know, I don't think
she really wanted it, so I offered.

05:46.925 --> 05:48.430
You can't monopolize the beeper, Ray.

05:48.435 --> 05:50.312
The other residents need
the experience, too.

05:50.315 --> 05:51.472
She gets airsick.

05:51.478 --> 05:53.441
Hey, what's going on with
your rhabdomyolysis guy?

05:53.446 --> 05:55.990
- He's pretty stable. He's making urine.
- What about his creatinine?

05:55.998 --> 05:57.763
- I'd have to check the chart.
- Peak CPK?

05:57.767 --> 05:58.931
Medicine team's all over it.

05:58.937 --> 06:00.443
Come on, man.
You got to be all over it.

06:00.446 --> 06:02.910
You cannot let the internal med docs
take over your patient's care.

06:02.915 --> 06:04.691
- I can't?
- Hey, I'm serious, man.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.843
You've got critical patients.
You got to stay on top of the labs.

06:06.845 --> 06:08.992
I know, but the guy was ready
to hand off, and I...

06:08.996 --> 06:11.413
- And what?
- And that was a great talk.

06:13.346 --> 06:15.121
What the hell's going on
with the PACS system?

06:15.126 --> 06:16.211
Down again.

06:16.215 --> 06:17.852
They said they should have it
running in an hour,

06:17.858 --> 06:19.753
but they've been saying
that since yesterday.

06:19.755 --> 06:20.991
So, is it true?

06:21.307 --> 06:24.333
- Rumor is you killed an intern.
- Yeah, I wish.

06:24.336 --> 06:25.840
You know, everything in this place
is crap.

06:25.845 --> 06:28.310
The equipment sucks;
the students are incompetent;

06:28.317 --> 06:30.033
the interns can't finish a chart;

06:30.037 --> 06:32.562
the residents-- they don't give a damn
about their patient...

06:33.307 --> 06:36.031
Yeah, okay, okay, Kovac.
I see what you're going to say.

06:36.037 --> 06:37.721
That I was the same way, right?
But I wasn't.

06:37.728 --> 06:40.051
- I didn't say anything.
- Yeah, I could chart, I could clear beds,

06:40.056 --> 06:44.310
- and I never passed out tubing a patient.
- I know, you were really, really special.

06:44.317 --> 06:48.053
You need to go through in-service
exam results with your residents.

06:48.808 --> 06:50.212
Have you seen these?

06:50.216 --> 06:51.762
See, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

06:51.766 --> 06:53.991
They don't know jack
about emergency medicine.

06:54.025 --> 06:56.750
Solomon is an idiot,
Hope is annoying and incompetent,

06:56.754 --> 06:58.991
Gates should have stayed a paramedic,
and Jane is like...

06:58.991 --> 07:00.398
What's wrong with Jane?
She is good.

07:00.470 --> 07:03.522
No, Jane is creepy, I'm serious.
She's always sneaking up on me.

07:03.529 --> 07:04.860
She's like those twins in The Shining.

07:04.868 --> 07:08.973
Look, in-service shows you their strengths
and weaknesses, so focus on that.

07:08.978 --> 07:12.490
They all have their own learning process,
so you need to adjust accordingly.

07:12.497 --> 07:15.703
If the residents fail, it may be
because you're a bad teacher.

07:27.005 --> 07:31.680
Down on two, up on three,
and mommies let go!

07:31.705 --> 07:32.772
Good.

07:33.206 --> 07:35.463
Everyone pick up their babies.

07:39.007 --> 07:39.991
Hi.

07:40.808 --> 07:44.290
I'm sorry I'm late.
I'm Abby, and, uh, this is Joe.

07:51.986 --> 07:56.030
Um, am-am I in the right place?
This is the, uh, Mommy and Baby class?

07:56.035 --> 07:57.533
Yes. Yes, it is.

07:57.606 --> 08:00.860
Good. Well, uh... I'm a mommy...

08:01.366 --> 08:03.082
...and, uh... and this is a baby.

08:03.408 --> 08:05.511
Uh, yeah, being suspended by his crotch.

08:06.195 --> 08:07.362
Excuse me?

08:07.695 --> 08:11.122
You're carrying your child in a device
that can cause hip luxation

08:11.128 --> 08:13.991
and spinal injury.
He should be in a sling.

08:13.998 --> 08:17.141
Oh, well, you know,
I'm a doctor, um, and...

08:17.148 --> 08:19.230
Then you'd think she'd know better.

08:19.237 --> 08:22.041
She is sitting right here.

08:22.048 --> 08:24.621
Well, um, then you should know that--

08:24.625 --> 08:28.011
a happy, healthy baby is always carried
in a sling.

08:28.895 --> 08:33.450
Well, I do know that if you dress your baby
like some sort of designer accessory,

08:33.456 --> 08:37.111
you're headed for problems.
But don't worry. I work in the ER,

08:37.116 --> 08:40.890
so I'll be there to take care of her
when she comes in 14, pregnant,

08:40.895 --> 08:44.912
- with a drug overdose.
- Maybe this isn't the best class for you.

08:45.708 --> 08:48.361
Thank you so much
for the lunch tray, Archie.

08:48.367 --> 08:50.701
I particularly enjoyed
the bread pudding.

08:50.707 --> 08:53.092
Oh, you're welcome, Emma.
That's one of my favorites, too.

08:53.286 --> 08:55.063
Ah, the return of Goat Boy.

08:55.116 --> 08:58.500
I heard one of the doctors made a charm
bracelet from all they took from his belly.

08:58.577 --> 09:01.092
Okay, here's what we got:
stable CHF, going to tele.

09:01.106 --> 09:03.753
76-year-old lady with pyelo,
had levaquin.

09:03.757 --> 09:06.333
Incomplete miscarriage.
Do a repeat pelvic in an hour to see if...

09:06.338 --> 09:07.600
- everything passed and the os is closed.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

09:07.617 --> 09:09.000
- What the hell are these?
- Pass-ons.

09:09.017 --> 09:11.011
Oh, and her BP's a little low,
like 90 systolic.

09:11.016 --> 09:12.823
It's up with two liters,
and her crit was 24.

09:12.828 --> 09:14.282
She's type-and-crossed for transfusion?

09:14.287 --> 09:16.523
No, but that's a... that's a good idea.
Do that, totally.

09:16.526 --> 09:19.553
Two-year-old with possible meningitis.
Ceftriaxone on board.

09:19.557 --> 09:21.881
Currently at CT, needs an LP
when he gets back.

09:21.908 --> 09:24.500
- Morris, we do not sign out spinal taps.
- Since when?

09:24.576 --> 09:26.003
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hold on.

09:26.008 --> 09:27.543
These aren't pass-ons.
They're train wrecks.

09:27.548 --> 09:29.071
- I'm not taking them.
- Dude, I can't.

09:29.075 --> 09:30.703
Max has a soccer game.
It's the playoffs.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.502
- I promised him I'd be there.
- Who?

09:32.538 --> 09:34.241
My son.
It's a family thing.

09:34.308 --> 09:35.662
Yeah, his family even know
about you yet?

09:35.667 --> 09:38.233
No, no, no, no. We're keeping that
on the low-low for now.

09:38.236 --> 09:39.440
You know what I'm saying?

09:39.818 --> 09:41.640
Exactly.
Thanks, dog.

09:43.465 --> 09:44.671
Did you just see that?

09:45.057 --> 09:47.070
Yup. He's your dogboy.

09:47.075 --> 09:49.091
Please.
He's not my dog, and he's not my boy.

09:49.156 --> 09:50.630
And we don't use the two together.

09:50.807 --> 09:51.881
I know.

09:52.927 --> 09:54.660
- So, you're gonna take one of these?
- Nope.

09:54.705 --> 09:57.081
I have a trauma coming in,
and you're not always

09:57.086 --> 09:59.702
going to have the luxury of having
another attending on shift with you.

09:59.756 --> 10:02.541
You need to learn how to handle
these things on your own.

10:03.188 --> 10:06.943
Mr. Jennings is on his way up to ortho
and Lundquist is out of here.

10:07.006 --> 10:09.290
Nice job, Ray.
Here's four more.

10:09.326 --> 10:10.352
Are you kidding me?

10:10.457 --> 10:13.761
- Is this about the transport beeper?
- The packing is Webril, and we wrap with bias.

10:13.805 --> 10:17.750
We try to keep it tight enough to immobilize,
but not to the point of discomfort.

10:17.797 --> 10:20.910
- You don't want to cut off circulation.
- Salomon...

10:20.987 --> 10:24.343
you know, you didn't do so hot on
the Ortho section of the in-service.

10:24.425 --> 10:27.490
So what's the difference between a Jones
and a Dancer fracture?

10:30.906 --> 10:34.000
Dancer's a proximal avulsion.
Does great with conservative therapy.

10:34.115 --> 10:36.500
Jones is transverse, a little more distal
and you got to keep an eye

10:36.557 --> 10:38.742
on this bad boy because
there's a good chance of non-union.

10:38.806 --> 10:40.862
Let me guess: you just had a patient
like that?

10:41.007 --> 10:42.042
No.

10:43.206 --> 10:44.992
Right. Come on.

10:45.098 --> 10:46.741
Who's got somebody in Curtain 2?

10:46.746 --> 10:49.003
Uh, me, sir. 48-year-old

10:49.067 --> 10:52.023
- PSVT resolved with adenosine.
- Excuse me, doctor.

10:52.157 --> 10:54.063
Is your boss still here?

10:54.706 --> 10:55.750
Excuse me.

10:55.785 --> 10:57.871
I need to speak with Archie.

10:58.206 --> 11:01.433
Dr. Morris is not my boss and
I'm afraid he's gone for the day.

11:01.508 --> 11:03.340
Is there something I can help you with?

11:05.006 --> 11:06.373
No.

11:07.608 --> 11:10.650
Jane, you need to focus on cardiology.

11:10.697 --> 11:15.683
What are the options with a hemodynamically
stable wide complex tachyarrhythmia?

11:15.805 --> 11:19.003
- Lidocaine if you think V tach.
- What else?

11:20.626 --> 11:22.221
Amiodarone.

11:23.007 --> 11:25.682
Okay, I'm guessing Amiodarone.

11:29.236 --> 11:31.522
Well, Procainamide and Amio
can do the trick,

11:31.556 --> 11:33.902
but you want to stay away
from beta and calcium blockers

11:33.907 --> 11:36.913
'cause you'll end up with V fib
if you have a bypass tract.

11:36.986 --> 11:38.153
Right?

11:39.107 --> 11:43.403
So how'd you manage to fail every
subsection of the in-service exam?

11:43.416 --> 11:45.072
I guess I just don't test well.

11:45.407 --> 11:47.203
Well, you better start.
Come on.

11:47.267 --> 11:48.861
Have you got something to present?

11:48.868 --> 11:50.640
No. Actually I started with Dr. Kovac...

11:50.706 --> 11:52.011
Where are your charts?
Let me see them.

11:52.015 --> 11:53.121
Well, I'm still working on them.

11:53.127 --> 11:55.163
I told you to keep them current.
You got to do them as you go.

11:55.208 --> 11:57.122
What part of this concept
don't you understand?

11:57.205 --> 11:59.280
Five-year-old with crush
injury to abdomen.

11:59.287 --> 12:01.503
He and grandpa were
chopping down a tree.

12:01.506 --> 12:03.370
They're bringing grandfather
with chainsaw injuries.

12:03.378 --> 12:04.262
All right, I got it.

12:04.267 --> 12:07.030
Keep working up your patients
and grab a couple more charts.

12:08.155 --> 12:10.283
- Where do you think you're going?
- Chainsaw injuries can be gnarly.

12:10.287 --> 12:14.210
No, no, you need to finish with the patients
you've got before you do anything else.

12:16.137 --> 12:17.881
- Dr. Rasgotra?
- Yes.

12:17.887 --> 12:20.492
Hi, I'm Katey Evans-- medical student.

12:20.506 --> 12:22.691
Dr. Crenshaw told me to shadow you today.

12:23.116 --> 12:23.891
He did?

12:23.907 --> 12:25.683
I got the feeling
I was getting on his nerves.

12:25.686 --> 12:27.503
He gives that impression to everyone.

12:27.567 --> 12:28.681
Hey, Katey.

12:30.466 --> 12:31.361
Friend of yours?

12:31.507 --> 12:33.731
Hardly.
We went out a couple times.

12:33.835 --> 12:36.681
- It didn't work out.
- Too bad. He's cute.

12:36.936 --> 12:40.763
Cute, but he's way too into himself and
to be honest, he's orally challenged.

12:40.768 --> 12:42.223
Oh, bad breath?

12:42.306 --> 12:46.132
Not exactly--
he won't go south of 14th Street.

12:47.735 --> 12:50.620
You know...
He refuses to dine at the Y?

12:51.646 --> 12:53.401
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:54.028 --> 12:55.391
This is what I'm talking about.

12:55.425 --> 12:57.901
Making friends and saving lives.

12:57.908 --> 13:01.193
Does it get any better than this, ladies?
No, it does not.

13:01.977 --> 13:05.611
So, Mrs. Draper is back for
her 27th hospital admission.

13:05.617 --> 13:08.322
- Status: postpancreatic pseudocyst.
- 27th?

13:08.386 --> 13:11.401
Yes. Someone needs to tell her the hospital
stopped giving out frequent flier miles.

13:11.405 --> 13:13.971
Oh, and she's a chronic rectal discomfort.

13:13.978 --> 13:18.123
And you two get to work her up
and review her old charts.

13:18.308 --> 13:19.811
All 27?

13:20.125 --> 13:24.552
No. Why don't you forget all
about visits six, 13 and, um...

13:24.606 --> 13:26.132
what do you think, 21?

13:26.136 --> 13:28.200
Yeah, that should keep it interesting.

13:28.205 --> 13:30.301
It'll be like playing patient roulette.

13:30.408 --> 13:32.362
Be prepared to present her
at afternoon rounds.

13:32.368 --> 13:34.113
Smiles all around.

13:35.247 --> 13:38.602
Maybe he should use his extensive surgical
skills to remove that bug from his ass.

13:38.606 --> 13:40.502
Oh, saved by the bell.
We're paged to the ER.

13:40.507 --> 13:43.612
I'm so glad I'm not doing an ER rotation.
I have heard horror stories.

13:43.617 --> 13:47.332
Oh, it's not so bad--
once you get used to the smell.

13:47.698 --> 13:48.711
The line is good to go.

13:48.747 --> 13:51.203
Pressure's only 85 after the bolus.
How much O-neg?

13:51.208 --> 13:54.253
40 per kilo. 800cc's.
Chest and pelvis films are back.

13:54.306 --> 13:56.111
- Let me see.
- Sam, your son's school called.

13:56.138 --> 13:58.562
- Said he never showed up for homeroom.
- First hemoglobin is 9.8. What?

13:58.565 --> 13:59.683
I dropped him off this morning.

13:59.688 --> 14:02.232
Type and cross four units.
He's losing a ton of blood.

14:02.258 --> 14:04.752
- Crush injury?
- Yeah. Unstable pelvis.

14:04.756 --> 14:08.660
Open book fracture with complete SI joint
disruption and lateral displacement.

14:08.666 --> 14:10.602
- I've got the T-POD.
- How's the belly?

14:10.655 --> 14:12.970
Spleen is okay.
Looks like a small liver lac.

14:12.975 --> 14:14.102
So he goes to angio first?

14:14.105 --> 14:17.300
For embolization. Hypotension and pelvic
fracture has... a 50% mortality.

14:17.305 --> 14:19.720
- Blood at the meatus.
- Probably tore his urethra,

14:19.725 --> 14:21.562
- but that'll have to wait.
- Along with his liver.

14:21.568 --> 14:24.820
If they can stop the pelvic bleeders
in angio, he might make it to the OR.

14:24.907 --> 14:28.330
Okay, bring blood, FFP,
and get him on a portable monitor.

14:28.505 --> 14:30.071
It wasn't a very big tree.

14:30.076 --> 14:32.190
It was only about eight inches
in diameter.

14:32.327 --> 14:35.503
I was just finishing the cut
when the chainsaw broke... Ow!

14:35.508 --> 14:38.291
Sorry about that, Mr. King. We're going
to get you really numbed up right now.

14:38.295 --> 14:40.011
Another five of lido to me.

14:40.208 --> 14:41.820
- How we doing in here?
- He's pretty lucky.

14:41.827 --> 14:45.013
Most of these wounds look superficial.
I'm just going to clean and close.

14:45.537 --> 14:47.080
How's my grandson?

14:47.086 --> 14:51.523
His injuries are serious: he's bleeding
internally, but he's hanging in there.

14:51.685 --> 14:53.153
- Can I see him?
- Not right now.

14:53.158 --> 14:56.742
We're taking him upstairs and we're going
to try to stop the bleeding, okay?

14:58.007 --> 15:00.512
You good down here
if I go up to angio with him?

15:00.518 --> 15:01.531
Yeah.

15:02.967 --> 15:04.320
I'm good. Go.

15:04.755 --> 15:05.810
Okay.

15:06.807 --> 15:08.740
I was being so careful.

15:09.478 --> 15:10.700
I thought he was safe.

15:10.756 --> 15:12.892
Don't worry, sir.
We're doing everything we can to help him.

15:13.196 --> 15:15.670
- Are you almost finished in here?
- No. Why?

15:15.706 --> 15:17.273
I could really use your help
in Curtain 2.

15:17.278 --> 15:19.200
You've got to be
a little bit more specific, Ray.

15:19.258 --> 15:23.650
Morris' little old UTI lady, the one that's
just "waiting for a ride," has a systolic of 55.

15:24.178 --> 15:26.090
Damn it, Morris.
All right, here, keep irrigating

15:26.097 --> 15:28.110
and set up another suture kit.
I'll be right back.

15:28.218 --> 15:32.101
76-year-old, fever
and gram-negative rods on the UA.

15:32.106 --> 15:33.821
Morris said she was tucked,
nothing to do.

15:33.826 --> 15:35.310
- I guess he lied.
- Yeah.

15:35.355 --> 15:37.433
Tachy after two liters,
he should have seen this coming.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.833
- Access?
- PIV, we're working on another.

15:40.227 --> 15:42.503
- Here.
- Rennie Stevens, welding tank explosion.

15:42.505 --> 15:44.480
Second- and third-degree burns over chest,
face, and arms.

15:44.488 --> 15:48.283
- Vitals?
- Tachy, BP: 138/90, sat 82.

15:48.368 --> 15:49.940
- Other one's more stable.
- Other one?

15:50.008 --> 15:53.443
Luis Escobar, 23,
shrapnel to neck and left chest.

15:53.506 --> 15:55.383
- Vitals stable, good breath sounds.
- All right.

15:55.387 --> 15:57.653
- I better page an attending.
- I am an attending. I got this.

15:57.658 --> 15:59.933
Put him in Trauma Two.
Jane! You're with Haleh.

15:59.935 --> 16:02.312
Solomon, you're with me.
Come on, Trauma One. Let's go.

16:02.317 --> 16:06.342
Ray, titrate dopamine and mix up levophed
if she doesn't respond to 10 mikes.

16:08.106 --> 16:09.702
Alex, where are you?

16:10.015 --> 16:11.581
No, you're not.
Don't lie to me.

16:11.985 --> 16:14.222
The school called the hospital.

16:14.586 --> 16:16.471
Yeah, well, you got ten minutes
to get your butt back to...

16:16.475 --> 16:18.353
Solomon, help Sam make some room.

16:18.357 --> 16:20.180
Please give me something for the pain!

16:20.185 --> 16:22.351
All right, another five of morphine.
Hang tough, Mr. Stevens.

16:22.356 --> 16:24.042
We're going to help you.
Start a second line

16:24.047 --> 16:25.890
with two liters of LR, wide open.

16:25.897 --> 16:28.890
- Full thickness over the entire chest.
- I'll alert the burn unit.

16:28.898 --> 16:30.012
Sats down to 83.

16:30.018 --> 16:31.460
Okay, listen to me very closely,
Mr. Stevens.

16:31.468 --> 16:33.441
We need to put a tube in
to help you breathe, okay?

16:33.445 --> 16:36.141
Eight-oh and an intubation tray.
I'll be right back.

16:36.605 --> 16:37.902
Talk to me, ladies.

16:37.905 --> 16:40.580
Blunt and penetrating trauma.
Thrown against a wall by the blast.

16:40.585 --> 16:43.220
Looks like shrapnel
to the upper torso and neck.

16:43.228 --> 16:46.731
- Hey, what's your name, man?
- Luis. Luis Escobar.

16:46.738 --> 16:48.573
- How's Rennie?
- Uh, we're working on him,

16:48.578 --> 16:50.602
but now it's your turn.
Tell me where it hurts.

16:50.606 --> 16:51.713
My chest.

16:51.716 --> 16:54.911
- BP: 95/65.
- Yup, he's decreased on the left.

16:54.918 --> 16:57.471
- Sats 92%.
- Any pain here?

16:58.127 --> 17:01.650
All right, CBC, chemistry, coags,
type-and-cross for two,

17:01.655 --> 17:03.972
liter of ringers, C-spine,
chest, and pelvis.

17:03.975 --> 17:07.570
Page surgery. I'll be right back.
You're doing good, Mr. Escobar.

17:08.108 --> 17:10.141
That's it, Max.
That's it. Hustle!

17:10.147 --> 17:12.701
Go, Stuart, stay with him.
Come on, Max, come on.

17:12.705 --> 17:13.733
You take this guy.

17:13.788 --> 17:16.021
If you can't go around him,
you go through him!

17:16.025 --> 17:17.992
- Hey, come on, man.
- What?

17:18.038 --> 17:19.893
You're not setting a good example.

17:26.008 --> 17:29.060
That's it. Nice, nice, buddy.
You're killing them out there.

17:30.678 --> 17:32.272
Who is that with your son?

17:32.748 --> 17:34.342
I don't know.

17:35.206 --> 17:36.563
Excuse me, Coach?

17:36.607 --> 17:38.790
- Who's Max talking to?
- I'm not sure.

17:38.887 --> 17:40.392
He said he was a friend.

17:43.307 --> 17:45.153
Chest x-ray on Escobar.

17:45.158 --> 17:48.253
All right, pneumothorax on the left.
Set up for a chest tube. I'll be right over.

17:48.257 --> 17:49.793
We're having a hard time
finding a second line.

17:49.796 --> 17:51.663
- Dr. Pratt, he's bradying down!
- Hold on.

17:51.667 --> 17:54.092
Try a saphenous.
If that doesn't work, we'll go central.

17:54.095 --> 17:55.690
- Right.
- Heart rate's in the 40s!

17:55.698 --> 17:58.620
I need to put a tube in your chest
to re-expand your lung, Mr. Escobar.

17:58.625 --> 18:00.571
- Need any help in here?
- Push 50 mikes of fentanyl.

18:00.577 --> 18:03.503
- What's going on with Morris' patient?
- Uh, I think she's doing okay.

18:03.507 --> 18:05.413
- I handed her off to Gates.
- Gates?

18:05.417 --> 18:07.571
- You left her with Gates?
- Yeah, he's all over it.

18:07.705 --> 18:09.860
All right, you're going to feel
some pressure here, okay?

18:11.908 --> 18:14.161
Gates is an intern, Ray.
Who's supervising him?

18:14.168 --> 18:16.173
I guess, officially, you are.

18:16.655 --> 18:18.781
Jane, find out what's going on
with Gates.

18:19.805 --> 18:23.240
- I'm not having any luck with the ABG.
- Angle the needle at 45 degrees.

18:23.506 --> 18:25.733
I can't see.
My glasses keep fogging.

18:25.738 --> 18:28.383
Well, maybe next time, you should leave
the hazmat uniform at home.

18:28.386 --> 18:30.491
- Feel for the pulse. You see that?
- Yo, Doc.

18:30.498 --> 18:33.032
Your sheet metal guy in Exam 3
lost his foot pulse.

18:33.038 --> 18:34.300
Nurses can't get his leg out.

18:34.307 --> 18:36.123
All right, tell them to give him
five more of morphine and,

18:36.125 --> 18:38.322
uh, grab me a Doppler.
I'll be there in a few minutes.

18:40.115 --> 18:43.810
Someone grab me a central line kit.
This young lady needs a CVP monitor.

18:44.248 --> 18:46.181
- You're putting it in a central line?
- Yes.

18:46.186 --> 18:49.302
Early Goal-Directed Therapy for Sepsis--
all the kids are doing it.

18:49.356 --> 18:52.112
- Are we going to get in trouble?
- No, this lady is in trouble.

18:52.165 --> 18:54.371
We're trying to save her;
that's what we do.

18:55.336 --> 18:59.743
God, give us the strength and the knowledge
to help save this sweet woman.

18:59.745 --> 19:01.781
Hallelujah to that, sister.

19:03.307 --> 19:06.403
Good embolization of the superior
gluteals and pudendal arteries.

19:06.467 --> 19:08.242
That ought to buy you a little time.

19:10.216 --> 19:13.901
- Pressure's back down to 60.
- Another 400 of PRBCs.

19:14.008 --> 19:16.043
Crenshaw's standing by in the OR.

19:17.708 --> 19:19.520
Looks like the liver lac opened up.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.633
- His heart rate's dropping.
- Damn it.

19:21.708 --> 19:24.641
Okay, let's transfer him.
One, two, three.

19:25.305 --> 19:26.862
Mig of atropine and squeeze in the blood.

19:26.867 --> 19:28.281
Want me to continue bagging?

19:28.325 --> 19:31.191
No, see what they need in the ER.
I've got this.

19:31.906 --> 19:33.020
Hi, it's me.

19:33.555 --> 19:35.352
Mommy and Baby was a freak show.

19:35.457 --> 19:38.010
So we're headed to the park
and I thought maybe

19:38.017 --> 19:41.233
even if you only had a couple minutes,
you might want to come by and say hi.

19:41.357 --> 19:44.440
I'm going to look for some normal moms,
so we'll be here for a while.

19:44.556 --> 19:45.542
Bye.

19:49.348 --> 19:50.980
- Hi.
- Hey.

19:51.708 --> 19:53.282
- Can I sit here?
- Sure.

19:53.356 --> 19:56.103
Yo no quiero perder mi trabajo
pero si mi jefa se entera,

19:56.106 --> 19:59.262
es la primera vez en mi trabajo
y yo estoy muy nerviosa,

19:59.268 --> 20:02.142
- yo no se que hacer.
- Quisas estas tarde.

20:02.367 --> 20:03.701
Is everything okay?

20:03.808 --> 20:05.310
She thinks she's pregnant.

20:06.168 --> 20:08.300
- Oh, congratulations.
- Oh, no.

20:08.687 --> 20:09.520
No?

20:09.586 --> 20:12.790
No, the father is the husband
of the woman she works for.

20:14.035 --> 20:15.402
Wow, that's...

20:15.758 --> 20:16.950
What's she going to do?

20:16.958 --> 20:19.843
- I told her to have an abortion.
- That's what I did.

20:20.506 --> 20:24.390
You got pregnant with the husband
of the woman you work for, too?

20:24.718 --> 20:25.873
It happens.

20:25.875 --> 20:29.133
Los uniqos hombres que no fantasayan
con estar con sus nanas

20:29.228 --> 20:31.512
son los que ya estan haciendo.

20:32.806 --> 20:34.182
What'd she say?

20:34.906 --> 20:38.140
Oh, "The only husbands that don't
fantasize about banging their nanny...

20:38.146 --> 20:40.041
are the ones who are already doing it."

20:40.107 --> 20:41.703
It's sort of our nanny motto.

20:42.106 --> 20:43.900
Oh, you're all nannies?

20:44.106 --> 20:45.663
Yeah, aren't you?

20:46.506 --> 20:47.651
Yes.

20:48.176 --> 20:49.741
Yes, I am.

20:51.606 --> 20:53.511
All right, tube's in position,
no pneumo.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.141
- Vent pressures are almost 50.
- Damn it.

20:55.145 --> 20:56.630
Chest wall's restricting lung expansion.

20:56.635 --> 20:58.492
He needs an escharotomy.
Ten blade.

20:59.545 --> 21:01.030
Sats down to 84.

21:02.606 --> 21:06.180
All right, put the vent rate up to 25
and the tidal volume down to 500.

21:06.186 --> 21:08.052
Solomon, I need room, man.

21:08.356 --> 21:11.282
Okay, Mr. King.
We're gonna find you a new parking spot.

21:12.187 --> 21:13.630
Mr. King?

21:14.305 --> 21:15.882
Mr. King, can you hear me?!

21:16.006 --> 21:17.691
Son of a bitch.
Pratt!

21:17.958 --> 21:19.362
The little head lac's not so little.

21:19.366 --> 21:21.601
All right, keep pressure on it.
He must've hit something arterial.

21:21.605 --> 21:24.003
Recheck a crit and type and cross for two.

21:24.337 --> 21:26.990
Okay, okay, sats are coming up.

21:26.995 --> 21:28.732
- Thank you.
- We need an attending in here.

21:28.908 --> 21:30.082
Pratt, take a look at this.

21:30.086 --> 21:32.722
All right, what's that, fluid
in the spleen? Looks like a hematoma.

21:32.725 --> 21:34.432
- Where's surgery?
- Paged them three times.

21:34.438 --> 21:36.483
- Anything else in the abdomen?
- Nothing in Morrison's.

21:36.486 --> 21:38.663
- Vitals stable?
- Tachy, but pressure's okay.

21:38.667 --> 21:40.380
Second hematocrit 38.

21:40.385 --> 21:42.401
Entrance and exit lateral
to the midline.

21:42.405 --> 21:45.160
- Doesn't penetrate platysma.
- Burn unit on two.

21:45.608 --> 21:47.643
- IV blew.
- We can't get a second line in here.

21:47.646 --> 21:49.923
- And grandpa's crit is down to 29.
- All right, I'll be right there.

21:49.927 --> 21:53.860
- What's going on with Gates?
- He's asking for a rib spreader.

21:54.097 --> 21:56.243
What the hell would he be doing
with a rib spreader?

21:56.556 --> 21:57.912
I'm not really sure.

21:59.408 --> 22:01.470
- Pratt, what do you want me to do?
- Just a sec.

22:01.476 --> 22:02.803
What's going on out there?

22:02.805 --> 22:05.090
Sorry, sorry, we were stuck upstairs.
What do you need?

22:05.098 --> 22:07.570
- Burn unit is holding.
- All right, page Kovac.

22:07.578 --> 22:09.331
Don't bother.
We left him with a pelvic trauma.

22:09.338 --> 22:10.901
The boy crumped in angio.

22:12.117 --> 22:13.111
All right, uh...

22:13.117 --> 22:15.400
Neela, get this guy up to CT.
Ray will fill you in on the way.

22:15.465 --> 22:17.962
Haleh, transfer that burn unit
call next door.

22:18.557 --> 22:20.742
Jam it into overdrive.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

22:21.086 --> 22:22.521
Come on, ref.
That's a foul.

22:22.596 --> 22:24.811
Come on, this is soccer,
not water ballet.

22:24.946 --> 22:27.512
Way to go, buddy, dig deep.
Work that ball.

22:27.618 --> 22:30.231
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
I got hung up at work.

22:30.355 --> 22:32.330
- How are they doing?
- Winning two to one.

22:32.386 --> 22:34.403
- Go, Stuart. Go, Stuart!
- Come on, Max!

22:34.457 --> 22:35.663
Dude, you stay with him, buddy.

22:35.685 --> 22:38.133
Come on, Maxie.
Kick in the afterburners, baby.

22:38.136 --> 22:39.633
Do you know that guy?

22:40.185 --> 22:41.591
No, who is he?

22:41.656 --> 22:43.570
Apparently, he's a friend of Max's.

22:47.406 --> 22:48.680
Never seen him before.

22:49.045 --> 22:50.762
Oh, okay, don't get fancy.

22:50.768 --> 22:52.793
Don't get fancy, just...
just put it in the net!

22:52.798 --> 22:54.142
Put it in the net!

22:54.896 --> 22:55.993
Goal!

22:58.136 --> 23:00.062
Yes! Baby!

23:00.208 --> 23:01.932
That was a rocket, huh?!

23:02.137 --> 23:04.061
That's got to hurt, right?

23:05.407 --> 23:06.200
Yes!

23:06.487 --> 23:07.491
All right!

23:07.668 --> 23:09.463
- Did you see that?!
- Yeah, that was beautiful.

23:09.508 --> 23:13.121
You were giving them a taste
of Maximum destruction.

23:15.426 --> 23:17.053
Hey! What the hell do you think
you're doing?

23:17.315 --> 23:18.993
- Did you touch my kid?!
- What?

23:18.997 --> 23:20.521
- You touched my kid.
- Whoa, whoa, wait.

23:20.528 --> 23:21.662
He's not your kid?

23:21.666 --> 23:23.582
No, I don't know who this creep is.

23:24.005 --> 23:26.251
Is this how you get your jollies,
touching little boys at a park?!

23:26.257 --> 23:28.121
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you're making a big mistake here.

23:28.125 --> 23:30.350
I think you're making the mistake
you freakin' pervert.

23:30.356 --> 23:32.783
- Back off, man.
- What, am I too big for you?

23:37.705 --> 23:40.452
Sir, are you okay?
Wake up. Wake up, sir.

23:41.007 --> 23:43.653
- Call 911. Get an ambulance.
- And the cops.

23:43.657 --> 23:45.530
There's no need to panic.
It's all good.

23:45.538 --> 23:47.472
I'm an ER doc.
I'm an ER doctor.

23:47.475 --> 23:49.490
Everybody just back up.

23:49.497 --> 23:51.782
Let me do what
I have to do and give me...

23:53.865 --> 23:57.882
They spent about one million dollars
on fertility drugs to have this kid.

23:57.888 --> 24:00.162
Look at her;
that's not a million-dollar baby.

24:00.166 --> 24:01.830
Right, like, take the hint, lady.

24:01.838 --> 24:05.561
Maybe there's a good reason why Mother Nature
doesn't want you having kids of your own.

24:07.535 --> 24:09.760
The woman she works for is a bitch.

24:12.257 --> 24:15.151
She felt sorry for her husband.
He seemed so lonely.

24:19.037 --> 24:21.093
She was always going away
with her friends.

24:21.096 --> 24:22.612
And all she did was shop.

24:22.617 --> 24:26.001
My boss has closets full of clothes
she never wears.

24:26.005 --> 24:27.870
Which il good for me.

24:27.875 --> 24:29.190
So you wear her clothes?

24:29.196 --> 24:30.770
- What, you don't?
- No.

24:30.778 --> 24:32.960
- You fool around with her husband?
- No.

24:33.566 --> 24:36.262
- He's ugly?
- No. Oh, no, he's...

24:36.706 --> 24:39.683
he's hot. He's a doctor.

24:39.687 --> 24:41.211
I worked for some doctors.

24:41.215 --> 24:43.701
They wanted to kids safe so they let me drive the Lexus.

24:43.708 --> 24:47.020
And they went away a lot,
so I could always use their apartment.

24:48.536 --> 24:50.490
Which they didn't know about.

24:50.776 --> 24:52.132
Course not.

24:53.535 --> 24:54.920
Course not.

24:56.625 --> 24:57.800
How you feeling, Mr. King?

24:57.805 --> 25:02.131
I was a little woozy there for a bit,
but I feel better after my nap.

25:02.935 --> 25:05.402
Bacitracin and a gauze dressing.

25:05.405 --> 25:07.061
These need to come out in seven days.

25:07.067 --> 25:08.901
You know, I could probably take
those out myself.

25:08.906 --> 25:09.702
No.

25:09.806 --> 25:12.122
You need to come in for a wound check.

25:12.126 --> 25:15.401
Hey, make sure that guy's X-ray goes up
with him to the burn unit.

25:15.737 --> 25:18.751
He's had three liters of fluid and needs
seven more in the first eight hours.

25:19.116 --> 25:21.331
Is there any chance I can be
with my grandson?

25:21.336 --> 25:24.770
I don't think so, but we can get
an update on his condition.

25:25.305 --> 25:27.692
CT's back on Escobar.
Grade three splenic lac.

25:28.005 --> 25:30.012
Okay, good.
Consent for surgery and he's all yours.

25:30.018 --> 25:32.391
Sorry, but my chief wants
to observe him down here for a while.

25:32.397 --> 25:35.852
- You just told me he tore his spleen.
- With no free blood, and stable crits.

25:35.857 --> 25:39.061
His belly's tender, he's tachycardic, and
he'll have other fluid losses through his burn.

25:39.127 --> 25:41.382
The OR's full.
We can't take him right now anyway.

25:41.387 --> 25:43.251
Well, we can't keep him down here.

25:43.258 --> 25:45.920
We're getting slammed and
he's tying up a trauma room.

25:45.927 --> 25:47.222
I don't know.
Put him in the ICU.

25:47.225 --> 25:49.403
Crenshaw says we can't use
our last bed in ICU.

25:49.407 --> 25:51.181
Hey, that's not Crenshaw's call.

25:51.705 --> 25:53.082
What do you want me to do?

25:53.246 --> 25:54.910
I want you to get rid of him.

25:56.357 --> 25:59.372
If his crits are stable for six hours,
he can go to telemetry.

25:59.377 --> 26:00.322
Neela...

26:02.307 --> 26:04.151
Luis Escobar's girlfriend is here.

26:04.206 --> 26:06.331
All right, I got to go find Gates
before he kills somebody.

26:06.337 --> 26:08.603
When I get back,
that guy better not be here.

26:09.176 --> 26:13.220
Systolic pressure in the 70s
after aggressive fluid resuscitation but

26:13.226 --> 26:16.780
responded well to a dopamine infusion
at 10 mikes per kilo per minute.

26:16.786 --> 26:17.763
- What have you been doing?
- Excuse me.

26:17.768 --> 26:21.921
Central venous oxygen saturation is
in target range of 88%.

26:21.925 --> 26:25.132
At this time, patient remains guarded
but stable for critical care service.

26:25.136 --> 26:27.292
- What is that?
- I'm dictating my notes.

26:27.298 --> 26:28.921
And you're kidding me, right?

26:29.006 --> 26:31.610
There's no time for you to send stuff
to a transcription service.

26:31.615 --> 26:33.100
I need your notes on the chart now.

26:33.105 --> 26:35.471
Well, I find it so inefficient
to write everything down.

26:35.477 --> 26:37.892
Yeah, well, that's how we all do it,
so you better figure it out.

26:37.895 --> 26:39.692
And what were you doing
with a rib spreader?

26:39.696 --> 26:42.020
Well, one of your minor victims
from the explosion came in

26:42.025 --> 26:43.292
with metal wrapped around his leg.

26:43.296 --> 26:44.751
It was occluding blood flow to the foot,

26:44.757 --> 26:47.061
so I used the rib spreader
to pull the metal off.

26:47.815 --> 26:50.622
- Seemed safer than a blowtorch, right?
- Yeah, right, right, right.

26:50.627 --> 26:53.891
Okay, hold on, hold on, one second,
one second, man.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.342
I get it, okay.

26:56.345 --> 26:59.050
You're the cool guy,
the paramedic who became a doctor.

26:59.058 --> 27:01.082
And I'm pretty sure that
all the residents are

27:01.087 --> 27:03.153
eating up your war stories
and tales from the street--

27:03.155 --> 27:05.162
- I don't tell war stories.
- But this is the ER.

27:05.167 --> 27:06.423
And we have a way of doing things,

27:06.426 --> 27:08.623
a curriculum for shaping young doctors,
even you.

27:08.625 --> 27:11.033
Oh, is that what this is about?
You feel the need to "shape" me?

27:11.038 --> 27:13.550
Why don't you just teach me.
I like the shape I'm in.

27:13.556 --> 27:16.453
I can't teach somebody who thinks
they know everything.

27:16.608 --> 27:17.781
What are you talking about?

27:17.787 --> 27:20.103
Talking about you running around here
unsupervised.

27:20.108 --> 27:21.832
- Putting in central lines.
- What was I supposed to do?

27:21.835 --> 27:23.011
You were busy in a double trauma.

27:23.017 --> 27:24.500
I saved some woman's life
and some guy's foot.

27:24.506 --> 27:26.541
And what would have happened
if you had messed up on either one?

27:26.546 --> 27:27.372
I don't know.

27:27.376 --> 27:29.511
Who would have been responsible
for that? Not you.

27:29.515 --> 27:31.743
Me. It would have been
my ass on the line.

27:31.747 --> 27:33.682
So do we have to go through
this every damn shift?

27:33.686 --> 27:35.822
I don't know. You going to ride
my ass every damn shift?

27:35.825 --> 27:37.422
Because you seem
to be missing the point here.

27:37.428 --> 27:38.812
I didn't mess up.

27:38.816 --> 27:40.640
That's not the point,
and that's your problem.

27:40.645 --> 27:42.112
Who's got the urosepsis case?

27:42.117 --> 27:45.011
- Dr. Gates. At your service.
- Maya Tennyson, Critical Care.

27:45.016 --> 27:47.210
Yeah, excuse me, Dr. Tennyson,
but we're in the middle of some...

27:47.218 --> 27:48.713
She's still on dopa at 10?

27:48.716 --> 27:50.570
She's holding her pressure
like a champ.

27:52.505 --> 27:54.961
Hmm, nice work with
the early goal-directed therapy.

27:54.968 --> 27:56.790
By the way, I love the dictation.

27:56.797 --> 27:58.812
I can never read anyone's
writing down here.

27:58.817 --> 28:00.703
The Bluetooth. You just speak
in this little machine right here

28:00.705 --> 28:01.931
and it prints up instantly at the desk.

28:01.936 --> 28:04.910
I like it. This ER needed
an attending with some initiative.

28:04.918 --> 28:06.450
Hey, I'm the attending.
He's an intern.

28:06.456 --> 28:08.841
Well, actually,
the Bluetooth was Dr. Pratt's idea.

28:09.206 --> 28:10.750
I want to see the rest
of your charts now.

28:10.757 --> 28:12.422
I bet you do.

28:14.747 --> 28:17.580
Hey, Timmy, do they still
put people's names on hats

28:17.585 --> 28:19.271
and stuff like that in the gift shop?

28:19.278 --> 28:20.711
You know what?
I think so.

28:20.716 --> 28:22.942
But if you want to write your name
in your underwear or something, man,

28:22.948 --> 28:24.640
- a Sharpie works just as well.
- No, no, no.

28:24.646 --> 28:27.121
I just need to get a gift for somebody.
What the hell happened to you?

28:27.127 --> 28:29.441
I was attacked by ninjas.
What's it look like?

28:29.606 --> 28:30.652
Who's this?

28:30.656 --> 28:33.733
Obnoxious soccer dad,
blunt head trauma with LOC,

28:33.736 --> 28:35.850
breathing on his own, normal vitals.
What's open?

28:35.858 --> 28:37.551
- Talk to me, Morris.
- Nothing to talk about.

28:37.557 --> 28:40.023
Guy came at me. I defended myself.
I'm patching him up.

28:40.606 --> 28:41.841
Why'd he come at you?

28:41.846 --> 28:43.991
Have you ever been to
a kids' soccer game?

28:43.996 --> 28:45.780
Those parents are crazy.

28:46.408 --> 28:50.501
I would never do anything
to hurt my grandson, Irene.

28:50.505 --> 28:51.843
It was an accident.

28:51.845 --> 28:55.180
What were you thinking?
He's only five years old.

28:55.187 --> 28:57.680
He shouldn't be
anywhere near a chainsaw.

28:57.687 --> 28:59.002
He wasn't.

28:59.208 --> 29:02.433
- Then why is he in surgery?
- Hey, I'm Dr. Pratt.

29:02.437 --> 29:05.323
Dennis King, this is my wife, Irene.

29:05.496 --> 29:07.131
I can't believe this.

29:07.138 --> 29:11.642
We only leave our son with family, just
to be safe, and this is how we're rewarded?

29:11.646 --> 29:13.980
We're doing everything we can for Thomas.

29:13.985 --> 29:17.840
Why don't I have a nurse take you up so you can
be with him when he gets out of surgery?

29:19.005 --> 29:23.382
Dennis, Dennis, I'm sorry.

29:23.785 --> 29:25.271
You know I am.

29:26.108 --> 29:29.163
I know, Dad, I know.

29:33.636 --> 29:36.262
I raised my two boys by myself.

29:37.285 --> 29:39.793
Wasn't easy being
a single dad back then. I...

29:40.037 --> 29:42.382
I don't think I was very good at it.

29:42.756 --> 29:47.180
I thought I could make up for it
by being a terrific grandfather, but...

29:49.218 --> 29:51.402
Looks like I blew that too.

29:54.535 --> 29:56.070
Pratt.
You got a sec?

29:56.777 --> 29:59.533
Yeah. I'll be right back, Mr. King.

29:59.967 --> 30:00.882
Thanks.

30:01.307 --> 30:02.552
What's going on?

30:02.796 --> 30:06.252
The police are here for Morris
in connection with an assault.

30:06.308 --> 30:10.753
And there are two moms with the cops
saying that Morris is a child molester.

30:10.756 --> 30:11.912
What?

30:12.955 --> 30:15.040
I got a feeling the white mom's
got a boxer's fracture.

30:15.045 --> 30:16.652
What is Morris' problem?

30:16.656 --> 30:19.480
Brain damage is the first thing
that comes to mind.

30:19.485 --> 30:20.403
Dr. Pratt.

30:20.455 --> 30:22.141
Escobar's losing his airway.

30:24.006 --> 30:25.331
Why didn't you intubate prophylactically?

30:25.335 --> 30:26.201
His face was spared.

30:26.207 --> 30:28.513
He didn't seem like
he had respiratory issues.

30:28.955 --> 30:30.482
Damn, he's already got
too much swelling.

30:30.486 --> 30:31.662
Page Crenshaw again.

30:31.667 --> 30:33.421
And get someone from ENT down here.

30:33.425 --> 30:34.432
Sats down to 76.

30:34.438 --> 30:37.602
All right, somebody get me
a smaller tube. A 7-5, 7-0.

30:37.637 --> 30:39.391
It's too late for that.
You might need an open trach.

30:39.396 --> 30:41.733
- Heart rate is dropping.
- Please help him.

30:41.805 --> 30:44.373
- He was just talking to me.
- Damn, that 7-0 won't pass.

30:44.376 --> 30:45.322
He needs a trach.

30:45.328 --> 30:47.513
ENT is in OR 2 on
a radical neck dissection.

30:47.517 --> 30:49.580
- They can't come down right now.
- ENT needs to be here.

30:49.586 --> 30:51.142
Well, they're not,
and this guy needs an airway.

30:51.146 --> 30:53.291
- And you're sure you can do this?
- I think so.

30:53.297 --> 30:54.850
You better know so.
How many have you done?

30:54.855 --> 30:57.893
- I've assisted on several.
- Oh, man.

31:00.218 --> 31:03.393
All right, OR Girl,
please do not make me regret this.

31:03.395 --> 31:05.332
Okay, Katey,
Betadine and sterile sixes.

31:05.338 --> 31:07.433
Without electrocautery juice,
this will be messy.

31:07.435 --> 31:09.453
All right, Haleh.
Can you take Tina to the Family Room?

31:09.456 --> 31:11.173
- Sure.
- No, no, I want to stay with him.

31:11.176 --> 31:12.320
- Come on, honey.
- No, I want to stay...

31:12.328 --> 31:14.262
We'll come and get you as soon as
we make him more comfortable.

31:14.267 --> 31:16.793
Okay. 15 blade to me.

31:17.085 --> 31:18.292
Neela.

31:25.198 --> 31:27.940
Oh, I was hoping there were be
a raisonnable explaination

31:27.948 --> 31:30.442
for your incessant paging,
but you know what?

31:30.447 --> 31:32.701
- This is not it.
- I had to do a tracheotomy tube.

31:32.766 --> 31:35.681
Oh, really, and who told you to do that?
Because I sure didn't.

31:35.687 --> 31:36.963
Nobody did.

31:36.966 --> 31:39.220
My chief didn't answer his pages.

31:39.515 --> 31:42.281
- You did this without any supervision?
- Dr. Pratt was here.

31:42.285 --> 31:44.800
Oh, great, that is such a relief.

31:44.805 --> 31:48.203
Unfortunately, your little ER forest
friends don't count anymore.

31:48.225 --> 31:51.053
You want to be a surgeon?
Huh, want to be a big girl doctor?

31:51.055 --> 31:53.202
This isn't Barbie's Dream Doll Hospital
you're playing in.

31:53.207 --> 31:56.531
I am the ER attending.
Dr. Rasgotra was only following my orders.

31:56.535 --> 31:58.260
Oh. I'm sorry. Hello.

31:58.266 --> 32:01.220
Dr. Pratt, is it?
I took your silence for subservience.

32:01.408 --> 32:04.603
You know, not a lot of ER attendings
have the skills to do a trach.

32:04.656 --> 32:06.012
Very impressive, Dr. Pratt.

32:06.015 --> 32:09.643
Well, you just, uh, take care of my girl
here and we'll call it even.

32:09.646 --> 32:11.592
You don't need to worry about that.

32:11.595 --> 32:14.982
Dr. Rasgotra gets
plenty of my attention.

32:15.648 --> 32:17.853
Oh, I think I can manage this
from here.

32:17.856 --> 32:20.602
Why don't you girls, uh,
finish up down here.

32:20.605 --> 32:23.563
You've done more than enough.
Believe me.

32:25.606 --> 32:28.131
Wow, you're so lucky.
He seems like a great guy.

32:28.135 --> 32:29.173
Yeah, right.

32:29.178 --> 32:31.551
I'm going to go and find the girlfriend,
tell her what's happening.

32:31.678 --> 32:32.611
Hey.

32:34.245 --> 32:35.770
You did good, man.

32:35.775 --> 32:37.003
Thanks.

32:39.015 --> 32:41.220
Must be quiet if you have
time to stand around.

32:41.226 --> 32:42.382
How's the kid?

32:42.387 --> 32:43.771
Looks like he's going to pull through.

32:43.776 --> 32:44.872
How's the grandfather?

32:44.877 --> 32:46.730
Eh, he's a little worried,
but he'll be okay.

32:46.735 --> 32:48.231
You make out okay down here?

32:48.236 --> 32:50.021
I heard you had two more traumas come in.

32:50.027 --> 32:51.573
Nothing I couldn't deal with.

32:51.775 --> 32:54.793
Well, if it's that quiet,
maybe I'll leave a little early tonight.

32:54.798 --> 32:56.863
Abby could probably use
some help with the baby.

32:56.868 --> 32:58.913
- Go ahead. Go for it.
- Sure?

32:59.017 --> 33:02.540
Yeah. I got it all dialed in down here.
This place practically runs itself.

33:02.546 --> 33:04.752
Can one of you look at
a suspected hand fracture?

33:04.758 --> 33:06.880
- Who ordered the films?
- I did.

33:07.387 --> 33:08.902
Everybody was busy.

33:09.858 --> 33:11.033
I'll take it.

33:11.915 --> 33:13.332
Did you find Alex?

33:13.336 --> 33:16.683
Oh, yes, he was ditching school
with a friend at the mall.

33:17.147 --> 33:19.910
I guess I have all that
to look forward to, huh?

33:19.915 --> 33:21.200
Yep.

33:22.358 --> 33:24.810
You saved that guy.
It was so cool.

33:24.817 --> 33:27.522
- You mean "terrifying."
- Dude, you rocked.

33:27.527 --> 33:29.162
Did you see the look
on Crenshaw's face?

33:29.165 --> 33:30.610
The one that suggested
he was going to punish me

33:30.617 --> 33:32.553
for the rest of my natural life
for what I just did?

33:32.558 --> 33:33.750
You spanked him.

33:33.757 --> 33:36.502
Deep down, I think he probably likes it.

33:36.868 --> 33:37.951
Seriously.

33:37.958 --> 33:40.023
You know it's always those type-A guys
that are so wound up

33:40.066 --> 33:43.121
they go home and put on a diaper
or want to be led around by a leash.

33:43.128 --> 33:45.121
- You're mad.
- Hey, Neela.

33:46.295 --> 33:48.681
Ray Barnett.
I don't think we've officially met.

33:48.686 --> 33:49.982
- Katey.
-Hey.

33:50.795 --> 33:52.382
Um, I'm still getting some of your mail.

33:52.385 --> 33:55.772
Oh. I'm sorry.
I've tried to change everything over.

33:55.988 --> 33:59.000
Well, I don't mind. I just figured
you might need some of these.

33:59.006 --> 34:01.381
- Thank you.
- Okay.

34:04.508 --> 34:07.232
Okay. Uh, I'll see you guys around.
It was nice meeting you.

34:09.127 --> 34:11.281
- You two lived together?
- Oh, we were roommates.

34:11.286 --> 34:12.511
Hope you had benefits.

34:12.514 --> 34:14.139
It wasn't like that.
We were just friends.

34:14.146 --> 34:16.813
Why? That guy is smoking hot.

34:19.328 --> 34:22.382
- Does he have a girlfriend?
- Not that I know of.

34:24.745 --> 34:28.303
I just remembered something.
Um, I'll catch up with you later, okay?

34:56.007 --> 34:59.732
Witnesses confirm that the other guy
started and you just pushed him away.

34:59.735 --> 35:01.202
I told you that.

35:02.036 --> 35:03.841
But that doesn't explain
touching the kid.

35:03.848 --> 35:05.651
I wasn't "touching" him.

35:05.828 --> 35:08.400
My relationship to the boy
is complicated.

35:08.407 --> 35:11.341
It's, uh, sort of a secret.

35:13.206 --> 35:15.233
No, no, not like that.

35:15.497 --> 35:17.691
Well, your hand isn't broken;
it's just sprained.

35:17.698 --> 35:19.620
It would have been worth a fracture
if I would have knocked out

35:19.628 --> 35:21.502
that freaky little leprechaun's teeth.

35:21.507 --> 35:23.172
What's going to happen to him?

35:23.475 --> 35:25.112
He's going to jail.

35:25.118 --> 35:27.240
What do you think about that, Max?

35:28.485 --> 35:30.513
Wait!
Wait! Wait!

35:30.908 --> 35:32.452
Don't arrest my dad.

35:32.686 --> 35:34.241
What did he say?

35:35.227 --> 35:38.500
- Max, what's going on?
- This is where I leave.

35:39.215 --> 35:40.963
Good luck with that, Pops.

35:44.216 --> 35:47.560
Mom, Mom, this is my dad...

35:47.948 --> 35:49.820
Dr. Archie Morris.

35:51.245 --> 35:52.641
What's up?

35:55.308 --> 35:56.630
Hey, Timmy, did you get it?

35:56.638 --> 35:58.310
Yeah, but I didn't get a chance
to wrap it.

35:58.315 --> 35:59.913
Nah, it's all good.

36:01.305 --> 36:04.480
Gates! Just the man I was looking for.
Here, I got a present for you.

36:04.575 --> 36:05.772
What's this for?

36:05.778 --> 36:08.060
It's so, uh, people know who you are.

36:08.148 --> 36:11.520
- Hey. You didn't have to do this.
- Yeah, I did.

36:11.907 --> 36:13.150
Let's see.

36:18.997 --> 36:20.451
What the hell is this?

36:21.588 --> 36:22.862
Students wear short coats.

36:22.866 --> 36:26.420
It helps remind everyone, including you,
that you are still learning.

36:28.088 --> 36:31.153
- You feel better now?
- I feel great, man. Yeah.

36:50.168 --> 36:51.683
How long has he been crying?

36:51.685 --> 36:54.792
About ten minutes.
I think he'll settle down.

36:56.007 --> 36:58.641
- How was your shift?
- Uh, the usual--

36:58.647 --> 37:01.110
I had a five- year-old kid
crushed by a tree.

37:01.115 --> 37:04.041
I don't want to hear any stories
about bad things happening to children.

37:04.048 --> 37:06.433
He survived, okay?

37:08.957 --> 37:10.423
How about your day?

37:12.766 --> 37:14.343
It was divine.

37:16.478 --> 37:17.912
Look, I've been thinking.

37:17.917 --> 37:21.242
Maybe you're right, maybe we should get
somebody like a nanny...

37:21.245 --> 37:22.423
No, thanks.

37:24.688 --> 37:26.461
- But I thought you...
- I changed my mind.

37:30.307 --> 37:34.420
No nannies... just us.

37:40.016 --> 37:42.393
Doesn't sound like
he's settling down, hmm?

37:46.306 --> 37:47.643
I'll get him.

38:00.005 --> 38:03.391
Hey, hey, hey.
What's all that crying?

38:05.107 --> 38:09.512
# Should I stay or should I go now? #

38:10.108 --> 38:13.052
# If I stay it will be trouble #

38:13.847 --> 38:17.031
# If I go it will be double... #

38:27.027 --> 38:28.961
That good, hmm?

38:29.526 --> 38:31.241
I should have stayed a paramedic.

38:31.245 --> 38:34.932
No. Doctors are much more sexy.

38:38.165 --> 38:39.343
Rough day?

38:39.345 --> 38:41.483
Yeah, one of my attendings has
it out for me.

38:41.756 --> 38:44.260
Either that or he's in love with me.
I can't tell which.

38:46.968 --> 38:48.440
How was your temp gig?

38:48.805 --> 38:50.701
Same thing, different people.

38:51.386 --> 38:53.873
Nobody knows you.
Nobody really talks to you.

38:54.736 --> 38:56.823
It's like being the office ghost.

38:59.718 --> 39:01.333
Do you want a drink?

39:01.336 --> 39:03.422
No, I have to study.

39:03.428 --> 39:06.580
Knock-knock. You decent?

39:06.586 --> 39:08.252
I'm in my thong.

39:09.017 --> 39:10.471
Guess what?

39:10.977 --> 39:13.042
I take it your homework is done?

39:13.707 --> 39:14.733
Yeah.

39:15.626 --> 39:18.383
I've got some stuff from school
you need to sign.

39:18.385 --> 39:20.023
I left them on the table.

39:22.706 --> 39:24.033
All right.

39:24.338 --> 39:27.091
There's lasagna in the fridge
if you get hungry later.

39:27.098 --> 39:28.220
Thanks.

39:40.105 --> 39:43.173
Well, you were right about Adam Horner.

39:44.198 --> 39:45.843
I ignored him all day,

39:45.845 --> 39:48.673
even when he was looking at me,
and tonight he IM'd me.

39:48.678 --> 39:51.013
The Horndog comes through.

39:51.016 --> 39:53.361
- It's Horner.
- it. I bruise easy.

39:54.327 --> 39:56.172
Did you save anyone today?

39:56.338 --> 39:59.643
Yes. Actually,
I separated a pair of Siamese twins.

39:59.647 --> 40:01.813
Must be gross seeing all that blood, huh?

40:01.815 --> 40:04.011
Nah, I saw more blood
when I was a paramedic.

40:04.018 --> 40:07.123
Besides, I'm half vampire,
so I kind of dig it.

40:11.208 --> 40:13.161
Do you want me to help you study?

40:13.808 --> 40:15.803
No. I want you to work things out
with your mother.

40:15.805 --> 40:17.303
I'd rather shave my head.

40:17.305 --> 40:19.602
Oh. All right, good,
I have a razor in the bathroom;

40:19.606 --> 40:21.792
we can shave it
into a nice little Mohawk.

40:21.795 --> 40:23.802
Okay, I'm just kidding.

40:24.455 --> 40:25.980
I'll talk to her.

40:27.147 --> 40:28.373
Sometime.

40:30.648 --> 40:32.142
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

40:34.008 --> 40:35.082
Hey.

40:35.515 --> 40:37.191
Good night, baby girl.

40:38.087 --> 40:39.483
Night, Doc.

40:42.838 --> 40:46.770
For the next hour, we're going to be talking
about abdominal pain in the elderly patient.

40:46.776 --> 40:49.792
Now, I don't have to tell you
what an important disease this is...

40:49.798 --> 40:52.462
No pass-ons, no major tragedy, no deaths.

40:52.817 --> 40:54.963
- Gates still here?
- You just missed him.

40:55.008 --> 40:57.320
- What about his charts?
- They're over there.

40:57.726 --> 41:00.173
Hey, you know, from what I've seen,
Gates's a good doctor.

41:00.178 --> 41:02.482
Oh, he's all right.
Plenty of room for improvement.

41:02.615 --> 41:05.860
Dr. Morris, I heard some guy attacked you.
Are you okay?

41:05.867 --> 41:08.181
Oh, yes, yeah, I turned the other cheek.

41:08.185 --> 41:10.062
You know what Jesus said.

41:11.378 --> 41:12.233
You know...

41:12.678 --> 41:17.800
when the, those guys
who trespassed against him,

41:18.005 --> 41:20.310
as those who trespassed against us--
can I get an amen?

41:20.318 --> 41:22.111
- Amen.
- Amen.

41:22.837 --> 41:24.760
I have a patient waiting, so...

41:24.855 --> 41:26.922
Good night, Dr. Morris.
God bless you.

41:27.066 --> 41:28.950
God bless all of us.

41:31.277 --> 41:33.702
You want to grab a bite
with me and Max and his moms?

41:33.708 --> 41:34.710
You worked things out, huh?

41:34.717 --> 41:36.282
Yeah. Yeah, they're pretty cool.

41:36.288 --> 41:40.362
And if everything goes well at Ike's,
we may really work things out tonight.

41:40.368 --> 41:41.531
if you know what I'm saying...

41:41.587 --> 41:43.003
- Morris...
- and I think you do.

41:43.005 --> 41:45.751
- You do know they're a couple, huh?
- Yeah, a couple of lesbians

41:45.757 --> 41:48.103
in desperate need of a Morris sandwich.

41:48.206 --> 41:49.730
You know you're sick, right?

41:49.805 --> 41:50.761
What?

41:50.806 --> 41:52.281
Good night, Archie.

41:53.358 --> 41:55.242
Could you help me with
a two-layer closure?

41:55.247 --> 41:56.763
Nope, nope, not now; I'm off.

41:56.768 --> 41:58.831
Weaver should be here any minute now.

42:03.077 --> 42:04.352
All right, wait, wait, wait.

42:04.356 --> 42:07.303
First off, you never want
to inject directly into the wound.

42:07.355 --> 42:09.620
It distorts the anatomy for your repair.

42:09.805 --> 42:11.643
He needs regional anesthesia.

42:11.645 --> 42:13.741
Have you ever done
an infraorbital block?

42:13.746 --> 42:14.713
Not really.

42:15.307 --> 42:19.773
Okay, well, it's pretty easy
once you know the tricks.

42:19.776 --> 42:24.101
Now, first, what you want to do is
you want to use your left index finger

42:24.105 --> 42:26.163
to palpate the infraorbital ridge.

42:26.168 --> 42:27.893
- Got it.
- Good.

42:27.898 --> 42:29.860
Now you're going to inject one centimeter

42:29.868 --> 42:33.530
lateral to the ala and advance upward

42:33.535 --> 42:35.992
until you're five millimeters
from the ridge.

42:35.995 --> 42:38.431
Good, good, very good.
