WEBVTT

00:01.983 --> 00:04.518
I cannot stop staring
at that girl's face.

00:04.519 --> 00:05.886
Face. Huh.

00:05.887 --> 00:08.355
That's your weirdest nickname
for boobs yet.

00:08.790 --> 00:09.890
No, Ted,

00:09.891 --> 00:11.525
I'm really looking at her face.

00:11.526 --> 00:13.994
Aw... that's actually
really sweet.

00:13.995 --> 00:15.396
Puffy cheeks,

00:15.397 --> 00:17.665
smudged mascara,

00:17.666 --> 00:19.400
slightly red nose...

00:19.401 --> 00:21.268
That girl was just crying.

00:21.269 --> 00:22.570
She's so sad

00:22.571 --> 00:24.071
and defenseless.

00:24.072 --> 00:25.573
Anyone have a condom?

00:25.574 --> 00:27.241
Oh! Oh, God! No, no, no!

00:27.242 --> 00:28.509
That's it!
You know what?

00:28.510 --> 00:29.777
Five-minute time-out!

00:29.778 --> 00:31.112
Corner booth! Now.

00:32.214 --> 00:33.247
Hey, get this.

00:33.248 --> 00:35.082
You know my friend
Max from law school?

00:35.083 --> 00:36.517
<i>He's at Gregor's
Steakhouse downtown,</i>

00:36.518 --> 00:38.686
<i>and Woody Allen is sitting
two tables over.</i>

00:38.687 --> 00:40.988
<i>He wants us
to come check it out.</i>

00:42.157 --> 00:44.024
I don't know, it could be cool.

00:44.025 --> 00:45.559
I've never seen Woody Allen.

00:45.560 --> 00:47.628
What?! Robin, how can
you be a New Yorker

00:47.629 --> 00:50.064
and never have seen Woody Allen?
I have seen

00:50.065 --> 00:52.433
plenty of other famous people.

00:52.434 --> 00:55.970
Last week I saw... Maury Povich.

00:55.971 --> 00:58.572
<i>Kids, you know talk
show host Maury Povich.</i>

00:58.573 --> 01:01.809
<i>It was uncanny
how often we saw this guy.</i>

01:01.810 --> 01:03.277
Dude, everyone sees
Maury Povich.

01:03.278 --> 01:05.045
Maury Povich is everywhere.

01:05.046 --> 01:06.247
I'm sorry, Robin, but you're

01:06.248 --> 01:07.348
not a real New Yorker

01:07.349 --> 01:08.582
until you've seen Woody Allen.

01:08.583 --> 01:10.584
I am, too, a real New Yorker.

01:10.585 --> 01:11.852
That's adorable.

01:11.853 --> 01:13.554
You're from Canada.

01:13.555 --> 01:14.989
I have been here
for almost six years.

01:14.990 --> 01:16.724
It's not like
I just got off a boat.

01:16.725 --> 01:17.791
A boat!

01:17.792 --> 01:20.995
<i>Oh, wait, that is
how you say it.</i>

01:20.996 --> 01:23.097
I'd say you're not a real New
Yorker until you've stolen a cab

01:23.098 --> 01:24.732
from someone who needs it
more than you do.

01:24.733 --> 01:27.768
No, you're not a real New Yorker
till you've cried on the subway

01:27.769 --> 01:29.537
and not given a damn
what anyone thinks.

01:29.538 --> 01:31.105
No, you're not
a real New Yorker

01:31.106 --> 01:33.107
until you've killed a cockroach
with your bare hands.

01:33.108 --> 01:34.909
Those rules
are all stupid, okay?

01:34.910 --> 01:37.011
I've never done
any of those things.

01:37.012 --> 01:38.345
<i>By the end of this day,</i>

01:38.346 --> 01:40.781
<i>Robin would have done
all of those things.</i>

01:40.782 --> 01:41.649
Okay, time's up.

01:41.650 --> 01:43.117
What are we talking about?

01:43.118 --> 01:44.418
Woody Allen is
eating at Gregor's,

01:44.419 --> 01:46.487
and Robin thinks that
we should go see him.

01:46.488 --> 01:47.488
Why would I do that?

01:47.489 --> 01:48.956
I'll see him at
poker on Tuesday.

01:48.957 --> 01:50.724
Oh, come on,
if we jump in a cab,

01:50.725 --> 01:51.959
we'll be there in 15 minutes.

01:51.960 --> 01:53.727
A real New Yorker would
know the subway's faster.

01:53.728 --> 01:55.796
You just take the one,
and transfer to the two-three.

01:55.797 --> 01:57.932
Well, the bus runs
more often on weekends.

01:57.933 --> 01:59.300
Take the M-7 to the M-5.

01:59.301 --> 02:01.402
The bus? Every time
I take the bus,

02:01.403 --> 02:04.305
there is one crazy person
no one wants to sit near.

02:04.306 --> 02:06.407
That's why I have
never taken the bus.

02:06.408 --> 02:07.575
Plus...

02:07.576 --> 02:10.211
<i>I can run faster
than a bus.</i>

02:10.211 --> 02:12.546
Dude, that's, like, seven miles.

02:12.547 --> 02:14.048
You can't do that.

02:14.049 --> 02:16.517
You can't beat the bus!
I can beat

02:16.518 --> 02:19.220
a bus or a cab or a train!

02:19.221 --> 02:22.289
Is anyone else suddenly
craving green eggs and ham?

02:22.290 --> 02:25.593
Machines are overrated, and someone
needs to take them down a peg.

02:25.594 --> 02:28.862
You're all wrong... I got a way to get
there so fast, I could beat all of you,

02:28.863 --> 02:29.697
even if I

02:29.698 --> 02:30.864
sat down and ordered

02:30.865 --> 02:32.333
a big, juicy steak first.

02:32.334 --> 02:33.033
How?

02:33.034 --> 02:34.034
Medium rare.

02:34.035 --> 02:35.369
But that's not
important right now.

02:35.370 --> 02:37.438
Look, I know the city better
than any of you guys, okay?

02:37.439 --> 02:38.906
Oh, my God!
Oh, wow!

02:40.408 --> 02:42.710
All right, all right,
hold on, hold on!

02:42.711 --> 02:44.144
Let's just forget about it.

02:44.145 --> 02:46.180
Who cares?
I mean, there's no way

02:46.181 --> 02:48.682
to find out who's right anyway.

02:51.453 --> 02:52.753
First person there wins!

02:52.754 --> 02:54.455
Doesn't matter
how you get there!

02:54.456 --> 02:56.257
Stay sad!
I'll be back!

Hi. Can I see
a menu, please?

03:26.124 --> 03:27.824
No rush.

03:32.463 --> 03:34.264
<i>Kids, I should tell you,</i>

03:34.265 --> 03:36.466
<i>Lily really needed
a win that day.</i>

03:38.403 --> 03:40.704
<i>When Marshall and Lily
decided to have a baby,</i>

03:40.705 --> 03:42.572
<i>they assumed it
would happen right away.</i>

03:42.573 --> 03:43.907
It's gonna be positive.

03:43.908 --> 03:45.442
Eriksen man are hella fertile.

03:45.443 --> 03:48.078
When Uncle Morris was 16,
he got his girlfriend pregnant

03:48.079 --> 03:51.415
just by holding her hand too
tight in the backseat of a car.

03:51.416 --> 03:54.451
Now I'm thinking my
parents lied to me.

03:54.452 --> 03:55.719
Negative.

03:55.720 --> 03:57.220
<i>As the weeks went by,</i>

03:57.221 --> 03:59.389
<i>Marshall's confidence
never wavered.</i>

03:59.390 --> 04:01.858
<i>Then it started to mess
with Lily's head.</i>

04:02.994 --> 04:05.262
Negative?

04:05.263 --> 04:07.364
<i>Well, we know it's not me.</i>

04:07.365 --> 04:08.432
Everything's fine.

04:08.433 --> 04:10.701
These things take time.

04:10.702 --> 04:11.868
Not with an Eriksen.

04:11.869 --> 04:15.172
<i>Something must
be wrong with you.</i>

04:15.173 --> 04:17.908
Also, my mom hates you.

04:17.909 --> 04:19.476
You know what?

04:19.476 --> 04:22.279
Just to make sure,
I'm gonna pee on this again.

04:22.280 --> 04:23.647
What?

04:23.648 --> 04:24.715
No, you wouldn't.

04:24.716 --> 04:26.083
Somebody help me!

04:26.084 --> 04:28.919
Somebody help me!

04:28.920 --> 04:32.122
<i>Lily was so fed up
with not getting anywhere,</i>

04:32.123 --> 04:35.058
<i>maybe winning this race
was just what she needed.</i>

04:46.838 --> 04:48.638
Idiot!

04:49.974 --> 04:51.541
<i>I'll show them.</i>

04:51.542 --> 04:53.877
<i>My body can outrun
any motorized vehicle.</i>

04:53.878 --> 04:57.080
<i>I'm like John Henry
when he beat the steam engine.</i>

04:57.081 --> 04:59.883
<i>All I need is
a great folk song.</i>

05:09.260 --> 05:11.595
Â¶ Of a man who dared
to race machines

05:13.397 --> 05:14.631
Suck it, Grand-butt!

05:22.073 --> 05:23.740
Ooh, taxi!

05:27.178 --> 05:29.746
Excuse me, I got a thing.

05:31.349 --> 05:34.651
Maury... Maury...

05:37.355 --> 05:39.356
Track maintenance?

05:42.260 --> 05:44.561
20-minute delay?

05:44.562 --> 05:45.529
How do you do that?

05:45.530 --> 05:47.697
I grew up here;
I speak conductor.

05:47.698 --> 05:48.965
Damn it!

05:53.404 --> 05:56.907
Damn it!

05:59.777 --> 06:03.146
<i>Kids, I also
needed a win that day.</i>

06:05.016 --> 06:06.983
<i>A couple nights earlier,
your Uncle Marshall</i>

06:06.984 --> 06:09.286
<i>had offhandedly mentioned
a Web site called...</i>

06:09.287 --> 06:10.987
Grademyteacher.net?

06:10.988 --> 06:13.123
It's this awesome site
where students can go say

06:13.124 --> 06:14.758
what they really think
about their professors.

06:14.759 --> 06:16.560
Hey, you're probably on there.

06:18.796 --> 06:22.265
<i>I couldn't help but see what my
students had written about me.</i>

06:22.266 --> 06:24.768
<i>And it was...</i>

06:26.637 --> 06:28.872
<i>...majestic.</i>

06:30.741 --> 06:32.475
<i>Until...</i>

06:36.414 --> 06:38.815
<i>Now, kids, I knew
I was a good professor.</i>

06:38.816 --> 06:40.851
<i>That's why I didn't
let it bother me.</i>

06:40.852 --> 06:42.552
<i>I had nothing to prove.</i>

06:42.553 --> 06:44.421
<i>Absolutely nothing.</i>

06:44.422 --> 06:45.889
Here's a fun fact.

06:45.890 --> 06:47.557
See the Alberta
Building over there?

06:47.558 --> 06:50.794
Oh. The brown one or the gray one?
That's the gray one.

06:50.795 --> 06:52.329
Did you know

06:52.330 --> 06:54.764
that in 18...

07:06.477 --> 07:08.812
Hey!

07:08.813 --> 07:10.313
Come on!

07:19.123 --> 07:20.690
Elizabeth!

07:22.994 --> 07:25.295
Somebody call an ambulance!

07:29.767 --> 07:32.002
Excuse me, I've got a thing.
Hey!

07:32.003 --> 07:34.504
That's my cab!
Gregor's Steakhouse, downtown.

07:37.141 --> 07:39.042
This is my cab...!

07:40.845 --> 07:42.145
Downtown hospital, please.

07:42.146 --> 07:43.980
It's right by
Gregor's Steakhouse.

07:43.981 --> 07:46.449
Take the FDR, and maybe
crank up some smooth jazz.

07:46.450 --> 07:49.920
<i>Uh, we're required by law to take
you to the nearest hospital,</i>

07:49.921 --> 07:51.554
which is St.
Luke's-Roosevelt.

07:51.555 --> 07:54.024
Uptown.

07:54.025 --> 07:55.325
Oh, no.

07:58.930 --> 08:01.598
It's my cab! This is my cab!

08:05.695 --> 08:07.362
It's Barney.

08:07.363 --> 08:08.864
Help me.

08:13.302 --> 08:15.404
<i>Robin also needed
a win that day.</i>

08:17.306 --> 08:19.341
<i>It had been
a rough year for Robin.</i>

08:19.342 --> 08:21.676
<i>First her boyfriend
and former cohost, Don,</i>

08:21.677 --> 08:23.011
<i>left her for another job.</i>

08:23.012 --> 08:25.714
<i>Then Robin met
her new cohost, Becky.</i>

08:25.715 --> 08:27.516
Hi! I'm Becky!

08:27.517 --> 08:28.483
Hi.

08:28.484 --> 08:30.585
I am so excited
to be your coanchor!

08:30.586 --> 08:32.821
Yay!

08:32.822 --> 08:34.956
Hi, Becky.
My, you're perky.

08:34.957 --> 08:38.659
Don't worry, I am not here
to step on your toesies.

08:38.660 --> 08:39.394
Oh...

08:39.395 --> 08:41.063
You're still the star.

08:41.063 --> 08:44.332
I made chocolate chip
cookies for everybody!

08:44.333 --> 08:45.667
Yay!

08:45.668 --> 08:47.669
<i>And just like that,</i>

08:47.670 --> 08:50.138
Becky started to eclipse Robin.

08:50.139 --> 08:53.308
I mean, literally eclipse her.

08:56.479 --> 08:58.947
This is my cab! Aah!

08:59.816 --> 09:01.817
Keep it.

09:08.224 --> 09:09.825
Hello.

09:09.826 --> 09:11.793
Ranjit, take me to Gregor's.

09:11.794 --> 09:14.362
Taking you to Gregor's.

09:14.363 --> 09:16.364
Â¶ As Marshall ran
with all his might

09:16.365 --> 09:18.100
Â¶ And passed his friend
Christine

09:18.101 --> 09:19.201
Hey, Christine.

09:20.937 --> 09:23.672
Â¶ That he had beaten
the machine

09:25.508 --> 09:26.575
Yes!

09:28.244 --> 09:30.679
Yes!

09:30.680 --> 09:32.647
Â¶ He brought the jukebox
back to life

09:34.817 --> 09:36.718
Hey...!
Oh!

09:43.126 --> 09:44.693
Ow. Ow.

09:44.694 --> 09:45.794
Ow.

09:45.795 --> 09:47.062
Last seat.

09:47.063 --> 09:48.296
Thank God.

09:48.297 --> 09:51.032
I just had the worst
cab ride of my life.

09:51.033 --> 09:53.168
Well, you're in luck.

09:53.169 --> 09:55.303
See that gothic
church over there?

09:55.304 --> 09:59.608
Those Corinthian columns were
designed by Giuseppe Pegatto in 1896.

09:59.609 --> 10:01.843
Ow. Ow.

10:01.844 --> 10:03.078
Ow.

10:03.079 --> 10:04.546
Hey, Ranjit, pull over.

10:04.547 --> 10:05.881
Pulling over.

10:07.583 --> 10:08.617
Hey, toots!

10:08.618 --> 10:10.285
How about a ride?

10:13.556 --> 10:16.391
Oh. Hey, Robin, it's you.

10:26.335 --> 10:27.502
See that over there?

10:27.503 --> 10:28.904
That's the old Arcadian Hotel.

10:28.905 --> 10:31.673
Fun fact... while today
its neoclassical fenestration

10:31.674 --> 10:33.375
is considered to be...

10:37.313 --> 10:40.115
So, is this ride your way
of apologizing for this morning?

10:40.116 --> 10:42.150
I'm sorry.
I never apologize.

10:42.151 --> 10:43.885
And why would I?

10:43.886 --> 10:45.287
Are you kidding me?

10:45.288 --> 10:47.489
Hey, Barney, can I talk to you?

10:47.490 --> 10:50.091
Sure. Stand a little more
this way.

10:50.092 --> 10:52.194
I'm scouting some talent.

10:52.195 --> 10:54.296
Pretend we're talking
about something important.

10:54.297 --> 10:56.698
Oh, well, this... this
is something important.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.867
Um, I'm having a... a
really rough time at work.

10:58.868 --> 11:00.468
You know, the whole
Becky thing...

11:00.469 --> 11:01.736
Oh, you know what?

11:01.737 --> 11:02.938
That's just getting distracting.

11:02.939 --> 11:06.074
Um, say "carrots and peas."
Carrots and peas.

11:06.075 --> 11:06.975
Carrots and peas.

11:06.976 --> 11:08.009
Carrots and peas.

11:08.010 --> 11:10.879
Carrots and peas.

11:12.548 --> 11:15.050
Guys, I can't stop staring
at that girl's face.

11:15.051 --> 11:17.586
What, you really had something
to talk about? Yes.

11:17.587 --> 11:20.388
Look, I've spent the last
six years in this city,

11:20.389 --> 11:22.424
focusing on my career,
all for nothing.

11:22.425 --> 11:24.192
Some lady almost got me killed.

11:24.193 --> 11:26.228
Maury Povich stole my cab.

11:26.229 --> 11:28.597
I swear, this city
is starting to reject me

11:28.598 --> 11:30.232
like a bad organ transplant.

11:30.233 --> 11:33.301
You know, everyone keeps saying
that I'm not a real New Yorker.

11:33.302 --> 11:36.171
Well, maybe I should
just stop trying.

11:36.172 --> 11:37.772
Robin, I had no idea.

11:37.773 --> 11:40.041
No, it's my fault for thinking
that you might care.

11:40.042 --> 11:41.243
Ranjit, stop the car.

11:41.244 --> 11:42.777
Stopping the car.

11:42.778 --> 11:43.745
No, don't stop the car.

11:43.746 --> 11:45.447
Not stopping the car.

11:45.448 --> 11:46.348
Seriously, stop the car.

11:46.349 --> 11:48.250
Seriously stopping the car.

11:48.251 --> 11:49.284
Look, you...

11:49.285 --> 11:50.752
Wait, wait...
Robin, hold on.

11:50.753 --> 11:53.121
If you want to talk,
I'm right here.

11:53.122 --> 11:54.990
Carrots and peas.

11:54.991 --> 11:56.725
Don't...

11:56.726 --> 11:57.959
You...

11:59.929 --> 12:03.498
I'll crank up the smooth jazz.

12:06.068 --> 12:08.703
Â¶ Our hero's strength
was fading fast

12:19.282 --> 12:20.782
Â¶ He then thought back

12:24.987 --> 12:27.589
Come on, Playboy Channel.

12:30.126 --> 12:31.493
Ow!

12:31.494 --> 12:33.061
Â¶ But the stapler's
mighty sting...

12:34.163 --> 12:35.897
Come on, Spice Channel.

12:35.898 --> 12:39.267
Â¶ The cable box's bite again...

12:54.083 --> 12:55.350
...uses a hybrid
steel tube structure...

12:55.351 --> 12:57.686
<i>Kids, that day, I had
a horrible realization.</i>

12:57.687 --> 13:01.189
<i>If you can't spot the crazy
person on the bus...</i>

13:04.026 --> 13:06.828
<i>...it's you.</i>

13:11.801 --> 13:13.868
<i>The good news is,
I was halfway there,</i>

13:13.869 --> 13:15.136
<i>and nothing could stop me.</i>

13:21.277 --> 13:24.412
Whoa!

13:24.413 --> 13:25.580
This is crazy.

13:25.581 --> 13:26.614
I can't believe it.

13:26.615 --> 13:28.116
Okay, this is clearly a sign.

13:28.117 --> 13:30.285
Let's just call it a tie.

13:30.286 --> 13:31.653
Forget about the race.

13:31.654 --> 13:32.721
Head back to the bar.

13:32.722 --> 13:33.655
Absolutely.

13:44.062 --> 13:46.664
<i>The race was back on.</i>

13:47.966 --> 13:50.468
Idiot.

13:50.469 --> 13:53.471
<i>One subway car over...</i>

14:09.588 --> 14:12.223
Oh, God.

14:18.096 --> 14:19.163
Oh, bite me!

14:23.301 --> 14:25.770
Faster. Mush! Mush!

14:25.771 --> 14:28.272
I need this win.
I need this win.

14:31.042 --> 14:33.010
And firing half my department
freed up the money

14:33.011 --> 14:34.445
to double my own salary.

14:34.446 --> 14:37.148
And this chick from Boston was
wicked hot in bed last night,

14:37.149 --> 14:38.616
and I'm getting more muscular,

14:38.617 --> 14:39.950
even though I've
stopped working out,

14:39.951 --> 14:41.652
and I've got this
amazing poker group.

14:41.653 --> 14:44.522
<i>Actually,
Barney did not need a win.</i>

14:44.523 --> 14:48.192
And I smell incredible.
Smell me.

14:48.193 --> 14:51.328
Just, seriously, smell me.

14:53.498 --> 14:55.966
<i>He did smell incredible.</i>

14:55.967 --> 14:57.234
Stop!

14:57.235 --> 14:59.403
Too slow. Switch.

15:13.785 --> 15:15.152
Sweetie?

15:15.153 --> 15:16.120
Are you okay?

15:16.121 --> 15:17.087
No.

15:17.088 --> 15:20.024
I am done with this city.
It wins.

15:20.025 --> 15:22.560
I just want to move
somewhere new and start over.

15:23.595 --> 15:26.730
You've had a rough year.

15:26.731 --> 15:28.599
But you're tough.

15:28.600 --> 15:30.534
And I love you like crazy.

15:30.535 --> 15:32.670
If you left, I'd
have to follow you.

15:32.671 --> 15:34.405
And Marshall would follow me.

15:34.406 --> 15:35.606
And Ted would follow him.

15:35.607 --> 15:38.809
The only upside is that we
might get rid of Barney.

15:40.245 --> 15:42.179
Bring it in.

15:45.083 --> 15:46.684
What did he say?

15:46.685 --> 15:48.219
No clue.

15:48.220 --> 15:51.555
Hey, is that Maury Povich?

15:54.659 --> 15:56.060
Hey! Lily.

15:57.062 --> 15:58.062
Sorry, sweetie.

15:58.063 --> 15:59.263
I swear I'll be a great friend

15:59.264 --> 16:01.232
at the finish line,
but the conductor just said

16:01.233 --> 16:02.967
you're going express
to Borough Hall,

16:02.968 --> 16:04.735
which means you're screwed,
sweetie.

16:04.736 --> 16:05.870
So long, sucker.

16:10.508 --> 16:12.243
Bring it in.

16:12.244 --> 16:13.944
Damn it.

16:15.847 --> 16:18.382
Hey, it's Lily.
Help me.

16:18.383 --> 16:21.252
And not a single passenger
would listen to me.

16:21.253 --> 16:22.720
I mean, am I a bad teacher?

16:22.721 --> 16:25.256
Do I just put people to sleep?

16:26.391 --> 16:27.424
Buddy?

16:27.425 --> 16:28.993
Hey, buddy?

16:28.994 --> 16:30.728
Need a hand?

16:32.163 --> 16:33.898
The machines have won!

16:33.899 --> 16:36.433
The machines have won.

16:36.434 --> 16:37.902
Dude, mellow.

16:39.604 --> 16:41.538
I can't do it.
I can't run that far.

16:41.539 --> 16:43.340
I can't outrace anything.

16:43.341 --> 16:45.309
I-I can't...

16:45.310 --> 16:47.945
I can't get my wife pregnant!

16:51.149 --> 16:52.549
Wait.

16:52.550 --> 16:54.885
Is that what this whole stupid
running thing has been about?

16:54.886 --> 16:57.688
My body has been letting me
down, and I just wanted

16:57.689 --> 16:59.390
to prove that it could still
do something,

16:59.391 --> 17:00.591
but it can't.

17:00.592 --> 17:02.426
Dude, you've been trying
for two months,

17:02.427 --> 17:04.361
not two years.
That's nothing.

17:04.362 --> 17:05.762
Well, you should talk.

17:05.763 --> 17:07.397
You know, you're the one
who's freaking out

17:07.398 --> 17:08.832
because you have
one mediocre review

17:08.833 --> 17:10.768
and, like, 50 great ones.

17:10.769 --> 17:12.403
64. But whatever.

17:12.404 --> 17:14.637
And you're designing
a frickin' building.

17:14.638 --> 17:16.106
I mean, come on, dude.

17:16.107 --> 17:19.042
Sounds like you guys
need to clear everything,

17:19.044 --> 17:21.545
subtract the negativity,

17:21.546 --> 17:24.381
and add some perspective.

17:26.785 --> 17:29.086
Marshall!

17:29.087 --> 17:31.588
Marshall, get in!

17:31.589 --> 17:33.757
Hello.

17:49.541 --> 17:51.141
There it is.

17:51.142 --> 17:52.242
Where are Marshall and Lily?

17:52.243 --> 17:54.178
Who cares?

18:17.635 --> 18:20.237
I won? I won!

18:20.238 --> 18:21.505
No!

18:21.506 --> 18:22.373
I can't believe I won!

18:22.374 --> 18:24.008
How did that even happen?

18:24.009 --> 18:25.142
<i>Here's how it happened.</i>

18:25.143 --> 18:27.344
Okay, he's in. Go.
Go. Gun it.

18:27.345 --> 18:29.013
Ted is in the way.
Run him over.

18:29.014 --> 18:30.147
Running him over.

18:30.148 --> 18:31.682
No. Lily, what the hell
is the matter with you?

18:31.683 --> 18:34.451
Nothing. I just want
to win this really badly.

18:34.452 --> 18:37.955
So badly that I just ditched
my best friend

18:37.956 --> 18:39.356
when she needed me.

18:39.357 --> 18:42.960
Oh, baby, you were also going
to run over Ted.

18:42.961 --> 18:46.163
Why did I get so crazy
about this?

18:46.164 --> 18:48.098
Maybe for the same reason
that I kept saying

18:48.099 --> 18:49.500
that I could run seven miles.

18:49.501 --> 18:53.470
I... I'm trying to be really,
um, confident and positive

18:53.471 --> 18:56.340
about all this, but, baby,
I'm really scared

18:56.341 --> 18:57.374
that we're not pregnant yet.

18:57.375 --> 18:58.642
Oh, thank God.

18:58.643 --> 19:01.078
I keep thinking there's
something wrong with me.

19:01.079 --> 19:02.646
I keep thinking there's
something wrong with me.

19:02.647 --> 19:03.881
It's only been two months.

19:03.882 --> 19:04.982
We are crazy.

19:04.983 --> 19:05.949
We're totally crazy.

19:05.950 --> 19:07.084
This is the last time

19:07.085 --> 19:08.986
it's ever going
to be just the two of us.

19:08.987 --> 19:09.887
Shouldn't we be enjoying that?

19:09.888 --> 19:12.289
We gotta go back to Paris.

19:12.290 --> 19:13.490
And take ballroom dancing.

19:13.491 --> 19:14.658
And really learn how to ski.

19:14.659 --> 19:16.860
Not just up and get faced
in the lodge.

19:16.861 --> 19:19.630
And see Coney Island.
I've still never been.

19:19.631 --> 19:21.899
See, we have a whole bucket list
of things to do

19:21.900 --> 19:22.933
before we start having kids.

19:22.934 --> 19:25.602
Oh, a cradle list.

19:25.603 --> 19:27.771
I'm...

19:27.772 --> 19:30.641
so glad we're trying, and I'm
going to be really excited

19:30.642 --> 19:33.777
for when it happens,
but this isn't a race.

19:33.778 --> 19:37.381
This isn't a race.

19:37.382 --> 19:39.450
Ranjit, screw Gregor's.

19:39.451 --> 19:41.185
Let's go to Coney Island.

19:41.186 --> 19:44.555
Screwing Gregor's.
Going to Coney Island.

19:44.556 --> 19:47.357
<i>As for how Robin beat
me and Barney,</i>

19:47.358 --> 19:50.527
<i>to this day, your uncle
Barney won't admit it...</i>

19:50.528 --> 19:52.863
<i>Who cares?
But here's what I saw:</i>

19:52.864 --> 19:55.432
<i>I saw Barney
notice Robin's face...</i>

19:55.433 --> 19:58.368
<i>and maybe realize something.</i>

19:58.369 --> 19:59.636
<i>Barney says he tripped,</i>

19:59.637 --> 20:04.641
<i>but it sure felt like
he tackled me on purpose.</i>

20:04.642 --> 20:05.876
<i>And when Robin won,</i>

20:05.877 --> 20:07.478
<i>I could have sworn
I saw him smile.</i>

20:07.479 --> 20:09.713
I won!
No!

20:09.714 --> 20:11.615
So I said, "The
cab, of course""

20:13.751 --> 20:15.652
I know what you did back there.

20:16.287 --> 20:17.621
Yeah.

20:17.622 --> 20:19.189
Check it.

20:19.190 --> 20:22.526
I just drove
a pedicab 26 blocks,

20:22.527 --> 20:24.761
and I still smell incredible.

20:24.762 --> 20:26.029
Smell me.

20:26.030 --> 20:26.930
I'm not gonna...

20:26.931 --> 20:28.532
Not gonna...
Smell me.

20:29.534 --> 20:31.168
<i>He did smell incredible.</i>

20:31.169 --> 20:32.336
Wait a minute.

20:32.337 --> 20:33.871
So, where is Woody Allen?

20:33.872 --> 20:36.140
He's right there.

20:39.043 --> 20:41.745
Damn it, Max.
That's Maury Povich.

20:41.746 --> 20:44.014
I always get those two confused.

20:45.517 --> 20:47.885
<i>Technically, there was only
one winner that day.</i>

20:47.886 --> 20:51.121
<i>And in that race, everyone
found exactly what they needed.</i>

20:51.122 --> 20:52.556
<i>It's true,</i>

20:52.557 --> 20:53.757
<i>she wouldn't see Woody Allen</i>

20:53.758 --> 20:54.825
<i>for another couple months,</i>

20:54.826 --> 20:56.560
<i>but that's how Robin became,</i>

20:56.561 --> 20:59.596
<i>by just about any definition
of the term...</i>

21:01.566 --> 21:03.100
<i>...a real New Yorker.</i>
