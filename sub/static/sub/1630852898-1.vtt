00:04.967 --> 00:08.133
Live from the
LOL Canada theatre,

00:08.166 --> 00:11.200
it’s Last One Laughing
with Jay Baruchel!

00:13.166 --> 00:16.367
Featuring the comedian who’s
always in the driver's seat,

00:16.400 --> 00:18.300
Caroline Rhea!

00:24.133 --> 00:26.400
Also ready to
steal the spotlight,

00:26.433 --> 00:28.100
Canada’s queen
of quips.

00:28.133 --> 00:31.000
The fiercely funny
Debra DiGiovanni!

00:36.834 --> 00:39.367
And you’ll always
get your money’s worth with

00:39.400 --> 00:42.834
the dark prince of musical
comedy, Jon Lajoie!

00:44.900 --> 00:48.266
Next up, it’s the granddaddy
of the avant-garde,

00:48.300 --> 00:49.734
Tom Green!

00:57.500 --> 00:59.200
But that’s not all!

00:59.233 --> 01:01.767
There’s nowhere to run
and nowhere to hide.

01:01.800 --> 01:05.266
From the signature comedy
stylings of the stand up

01:05.300 --> 01:06.800
who never lets up.

01:06.834 --> 01:09.066
Brandon
Ash-Mohammed!

01:14.667 --> 01:16.333
And say hello to
your friendly,

01:16.367 --> 01:17.934
neighbourhood funny man.

01:17.967 --> 01:19.433
Andrew Phung!

01:25.900 --> 01:28.066
Always bringing
something to the table.

01:28.100 --> 01:29.166
Master of characters,

01:29.200 --> 01:30.700
Chameleon
of comedy,

01:30.734 --> 01:32.800
Dave Foley!

01:36.533 --> 01:38.700
He’s at the top of the
improv pecking order.

01:38.734 --> 01:40.767
Uncaged and middle-aged.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.166
Colin Mochrie!

01:44.600 --> 01:46.367
Put your feet up
and enjoy all

01:46.400 --> 01:49.266
the funny clips from the
Mountain Man of comedy,

01:49.300 --> 01:51.667
K. Trevor Wilson!

01:54.667 --> 01:57.633
And the magnetic
comedy “roll” model.

01:57.667 --> 02:01.100
Don’t turn your back on the
mischievous, Mae Martin!

02:03.000 --> 02:04.467
And of course
our host...

02:04.500 --> 02:07.700
The man, the myth,
Jay Baruchel!

02:08.467 --> 02:12.667
It’s time for Last
One Laughing Canada!

02:27.667 --> 02:28.367
Holy fuck.

02:28.400 --> 02:29.767
Are you serious?

02:43.767 --> 02:45.600
Hi there!
I’m Jay Baruchel.

02:45.633 --> 02:46.934
As a professional comedian,

02:46.967 --> 02:48.900
it’s your job to make
people laugh.

02:48.934 --> 02:51.166
As a human being, it’s
your natural instinct to

02:51.200 --> 02:53.600
laugh when you see or
hear something you

02:53.633 --> 02:54.667
think is funny.

02:54.700 --> 02:55.934
Take five, guys!

02:57.400 --> 02:57.934
No?

02:57.967 --> 02:58.633
Okay...

02:58.667 --> 03:01.000
That’s what makes this show so
wonderfully demented cos for

03:01.033 --> 03:04.667
the next six hours, ten of
Canada’s best comedians will

03:04.700 --> 03:07.867
be trapped in this room together
like the fucking

03:07.900 --> 03:11.166
Stanford prison experiment with
one common goal:

03:11.200 --> 03:13.300
try and make
each other laugh.

03:14.567 --> 03:17.533
But here’s the deal: if
they laugh themselves,

03:17.567 --> 03:18.700
they’re out
of the game.

03:18.734 --> 03:19.900
Holy fuck...

03:23.767 --> 03:26.066
And the last one laughing,
now you get the title,

03:26.100 --> 03:29.133
wins a hundred thousand
dollars for their charity.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.800
Not to mention the coveted
LOL Canada crown and cape.

03:34.834 --> 03:36.633
I’ll be watching
all the action from here

03:36.667 --> 03:39.367
in my souped-
up lodge.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.967
I’ll be honest, I don’t know
what half this fucking shit does,

03:42.000 --> 03:46.800
but lord knows
I like a lever!

03:46.834 --> 03:48.233
Okay, here we go.

03:48.266 --> 03:49.700
Release
the hounds!

03:52.834 --> 03:54.600
We’ve got our
first comedian.

03:54.633 --> 03:55.667
Andrew Phung.

03:56.066 --> 03:58.266
One of the stars
of Kim’s Convenience.

03:58.300 --> 03:59.800
He’s an amazing performer.

03:59.834 --> 04:02.567
The opportunity to
go toe to toe with the

04:02.600 --> 04:04.867
best comedians

04:04.900 --> 04:07.300
and performers
across this country?

04:07.333 --> 04:09.834
Holy fuck!
That’s exciting.

04:12.834 --> 04:14.467
Hello?

04:16.400 --> 04:18.000
Alright, well I’m
the first one here.

04:18.367 --> 04:20.333
Look at how
clean he’s dressed.

04:20.367 --> 04:21.367
You could eat off of him.

04:21.934 --> 04:23.600
That’s
so funny already.

04:23.633 --> 04:25.266
Oh no, that’s so funny.

04:25.633 --> 04:27.333
I’m terrible at
keeping a straight face.

04:27.667 --> 04:28.934
I love laughter.

04:28.967 --> 04:30.767
So I had to like
tuck it away.

04:30.800 --> 04:31.800
Put it away for a little bit.

04:31.834 --> 04:33.867
I’ll see you. See you
on the other side.

04:33.900 --> 04:35.333
Oh man, I’m
laughing!

04:35.367 --> 04:36.100
This is pretty sick.

04:36.133 --> 04:38.367
I always wanted to host
a late night talk show.

04:38.667 --> 04:41.033
Please welcome to the
house, our next guest!

04:41.066 --> 04:42.266
That person!

04:43.233 --> 04:45.033
Who
might this be?

04:45.066 --> 04:46.867
Peter
Mansbridge?

04:46.900 --> 04:48.133
Nope, that’s
Colin Mochrie.

04:48.433 --> 04:51.367
Internationally
recognized improv icon.

04:53.567 --> 04:55.300
Ahhhhhh!

04:55.333 --> 04:57.000
No! No!

04:57.033 --> 04:57.967
Look
at this guy!

04:58.000 --> 04:59.166
I knew you were
gonna be here.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.600
I felt it!

05:00.834 --> 05:02.266
Oh, I’m gonna
be playing.

05:02.300 --> 05:04.767
the old guy as
much as I can.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.400
Maybe a fake heart
attack at some point.

05:06.433 --> 05:08.400
Aneurysms. Just to throw
them off and then...

05:08.433 --> 05:11.600
all of a sudden, the pants
come down and they’re out.

05:12.033 --> 05:13.467
Hey, that’s the game.

05:14.533 --> 05:15.900
First guest here.

05:15.934 --> 05:19.700
Legendary improviser, comedian,
star of Who’s Line is it Anyway?

05:19.734 --> 05:20.834
Give it up for
Colin Mochrie.

05:21.033 --> 05:22.700
Thank you.

05:23.934 --> 05:25.734
So this is the kind of response
we should get used to.

05:25.767 --> 05:26.734
Yeah.

05:30.367 --> 05:32.133
I am Debra DiGiovanni.

05:32.166 --> 05:36.133
I like to say dirty things
and I like bad words.

05:36.166 --> 05:37.500
I think it’s probably
because I grew up

05:37.533 --> 05:38.934
in such a strict household.

05:38.967 --> 05:40.233
The minute I left the
house I was like

05:40.266 --> 05:42.100
OKAY
MOTHERFUCKERS!!!

05:42.133 --> 05:44.467
I was just... is that
already too far?

05:47.233 --> 05:49.633
- Wow!
- What?

05:49.667 --> 05:50.900
Hi everybody!

05:50.934 --> 05:52.266
Debra DiGiovanni!

05:52.300 --> 05:57.433
Absolutely lethal stand-up comic
but she is deceptively laughy.

05:57.767 --> 06:00.200
Debra, I’m pretty
sure she’s the first to go.

06:00.233 --> 06:02.000
I’m gonna say it.
She’s easy.

06:02.033 --> 06:04.300
And I mean it in
the way of laughter.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.734
From north
of the wall...

06:09.767 --> 06:12.934
K. Trevor Wilson, of
Letterkenny fame

06:12.967 --> 06:15.033
and a friend of mine
since I was sixteen.

06:16.834 --> 06:18.000
Ohhhhhh!

06:18.033 --> 06:19.700
Hey!

06:19.734 --> 06:21.734
I know you people!

06:22.967 --> 06:23.934
The painful part
is gonna be

06:23.967 --> 06:25.467
doing jokes to
no reaction.

06:25.834 --> 06:28.133
But I’ve played some
pretty dead rooms.

06:28.166 --> 06:29.967
I’ve done shows at
retirement homes

06:30.000 --> 06:32.300
where the crowd was
falling asleep.

06:32.333 --> 06:34.700
If you’ve ever had to stop
a show to be like

06:34.734 --> 06:37.800
“can a nurse make sure this
guy isn’t actually dead”.

06:37.834 --> 06:39.533
That’s a pretty
dead room.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.333
Holy jesus. Well, that
is creepy.

06:48.934 --> 06:50.100
Horrifying, Trevor.

06:50.133 --> 06:51.800
A giant fucking
mural of me.

06:55.367 --> 06:56.367
Oh shit.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.934
Here we go.
Jon Lajoie.

06:58.967 --> 07:02.867
Known for The League and, eh,
his hysterical viral videos.

07:03.767 --> 07:06.967
Hello, eh, my name
is Jon Lajoie.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.467
You may know me as the lead
actor in, eh, Saving Private

07:11.500 --> 07:13.567
Ryan and eh,
the movie Big.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.133
Those were
pretty popular.

07:15.166 --> 07:16.066
I’ve done some
other stuff.

07:19.133 --> 07:20.300
Welcome, welcome!

07:20.333 --> 07:22.266
Oh shit!

07:22.467 --> 07:24.100
Seeing
Colin Mochrie...

07:24.133 --> 07:27.033
already I was
like “I’m done”.

07:27.066 --> 07:30.533
This is the creme
de la creme.

07:31.400 --> 07:32.600
Um, the dressing
room is in here.

07:32.633 --> 07:33.166
Dressing
room? Ok.

07:33.200 --> 07:35.533
Also, it’s I
guess a prop room.

07:35.567 --> 07:36.867
Oh my God. Okay.

07:36.900 --> 07:39.667
Oh, props! Classic.

07:39.700 --> 07:41.133
I’m a huge fan,
by the way.

07:41.166 --> 07:41.734
Oh, thank you.

07:41.767 --> 07:43.667
I can't...
this is incredible.

07:43.700 --> 07:47.166
I think if I'm gonna have
a strategy it will be to be

07:47.200 --> 07:51.367
unconscious, for the
most part of the 6 hours.

07:51.400 --> 07:54.533
Can I roofie myself
before the show?

07:54.567 --> 07:56.400
Do you have roofies?

07:56.433 --> 07:58.233
Yeah, you look like
you have roofies.

07:58.266 --> 07:59.734
Yeah gimme...
give me one.

08:01.033 --> 08:03.033
Don’t tell the
other comedians.

08:03.333 --> 08:04.200
In here?

08:04.233 --> 08:05.467
I brought
some COVID.

08:06.133 --> 08:07.934
They’re not gonna
see it coming.

08:07.967 --> 08:09.967
Oh it’s gonna be,
it’s gonna be funny.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.300
I think everyone’s
gonna laugh.

08:12.200 --> 08:16.533
Okay.
Okay, well look at this.

08:16.567 --> 08:17.467
Okay, here we go.

08:17.500 --> 08:19.266
Brandon Ash-Mohammed.

08:19.300 --> 08:21.633
A very talented, up
and coming stand-up.

08:22.266 --> 08:24.900
Ooh. Oooh.

08:24.934 --> 08:26.266
Oh God!

08:26.300 --> 08:27.400
Oh!

08:27.433 --> 08:29.333
Ah, I fell! My black
hurts, I want a seat.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.333
I was like, I need
to appear confident.

08:33.367 --> 08:34.200
I am ready.

08:34.233 --> 08:35.433
And then I fucking tripped.

08:35.600 --> 08:38.033
Oh! Oh! OOOOH!

08:40.867 --> 08:41.800
I’m sorry.

08:42.233 --> 08:43.133
What am I supposed
to do now?

08:43.867 --> 08:45.400
Oh I gotta
put my bag away.

08:45.433 --> 08:47.700
Like everyone is
like very, very, very

08:47.734 --> 08:50.367
very, very, very,
very like established.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.500
Like I feel like... that
Taylor Swift character where

08:52.533 --> 08:55.567
I’m just like... you know
what I’m talking about?

08:55.600 --> 08:56.900
It’s like, uh yeah!

08:57.500 --> 08:58.533
Check out
the inventory.

08:58.567 --> 08:59.000
Okay.

08:59.033 --> 09:00.467
Ooh, they
got Kombucha.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.433
Very important to
keep you regular,

09:02.467 --> 09:03.433
and that’s what
you wanna be.

09:03.467 --> 09:04.266
Very important.

09:04.300 --> 09:05.467
Not too
regular, though.

09:05.500 --> 09:06.467
We’re here
for six hours.

09:06.500 --> 09:07.433
Yes. For six?
Oh lord.

09:07.467 --> 09:08.500
Yes.

09:11.400 --> 09:15.734
Holy fucking shit.
Tom Green, goddamn!

09:16.533 --> 09:20.600
There is only one him. Been
watching Tom my whole life.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.967
Oh my god!

09:26.000 --> 09:26.800
WHAT?

09:26.834 --> 09:27.834
Tom Green entered.

09:27.867 --> 09:30.200
I was genuinely shook.

09:30.533 --> 09:31.700
Hey Andrew,
what’s up. Tom!

09:31.734 --> 09:32.433
How ya doing?

09:32.467 --> 09:34.400
I look
up to him so much.

09:34.433 --> 09:36.133
I am in trouble.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.233
I think
this is a prank.

09:38.266 --> 09:40.967
I think we’re actually
on The Tom Green Show.

09:41.333 --> 09:42.533
Welcome to
the show.

09:42.567 --> 09:43.967
Welcome to the
show everybody.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.734
This whole thing
was an elaborate prank.

09:45.767 --> 09:46.834
No, no.

09:46.867 --> 09:47.900
I’m ready.

09:47.934 --> 09:49.834
I’m ready
to compete.

09:49.867 --> 09:51.233
I have thought
of some things that

09:51.266 --> 09:52.834
I wanted to do today.

09:52.867 --> 09:55.667
I probably shouldn’t say this
because when you watch it

09:55.700 --> 09:58.567
and then you realize I
prepared those things,

09:58.600 --> 10:01.567
you’re probably going to think
that I’m crazy, but that’s fine.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.100
You probably
already do anyways.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.233
Holy fuck.

10:08.266 --> 10:11.000
Here’s Mae Martin. Canadian
national treasure.

10:11.033 --> 10:12.734
Taken from
us by England.

10:13.467 --> 10:15.033
I’ve been in England
for eleven years so

10:15.066 --> 10:17.200
it’s gonna be
really embarrassing

10:17.233 --> 10:19.166
when I’m like...
Hey!

10:19.200 --> 10:22.033
And they are all like,
Sorry... Ellen?

10:23.333 --> 10:25.700
Who could it be?

10:25.734 --> 10:27.500
Uh
oh, uh oh!

10:32.166 --> 10:33.033
Alright!

10:33.066 --> 10:34.667
Oh my God. I’ve...
this is the scariest

10:34.700 --> 10:36.100
thing I’ve
ever done!

10:39.233 --> 10:41.934
Ladies and gentlemen, what
could you possibly say about

10:41.967 --> 10:45.667
Caroline Rhea other than
absolute freakin’ legend.

10:51.567 --> 10:52.767
Hi!

10:52.800 --> 10:54.667
The
queen is here!

10:54.934 --> 10:56.000
Hi Colin!
How are you?

10:56.033 --> 10:56.734
How are ya?

10:56.767 --> 10:58.533
You can make
me laugh in one second.

10:58.567 --> 10:59.433
One second.

10:59.467 --> 11:01.133
I make myself laugh
faster than that.

11:02.600 --> 11:03.934
No, we're
talking about laughing.

11:03.967 --> 11:06.533
Aunt Hilda from Sabrina
the Teenage Witch.

11:06.567 --> 11:08.200
Anytime you see
her on TV

11:08.233 --> 11:11.000
she’s swinging bats with
comedy heavyweights.

11:11.033 --> 11:11.934
Trev, Lovely to
meet you.

11:11.967 --> 11:13.000
Lovely to meet you.

11:13.033 --> 11:14.100
This could be the
shortest season

11:14.133 --> 11:15.867
of Last One Laughing.

11:15.900 --> 11:16.834
We’re gonna break
in 2 minutes.

11:18.633 --> 11:19.667
So cool.

11:19.700 --> 11:20.867
You ready for this
or you ready for...

11:20.900 --> 11:22.767
No, I’m filled with
regret and anxiety.

11:22.800 --> 11:23.633
Anyone else?

11:23.667 --> 11:24.433
Same. Same.

11:24.467 --> 11:25.567
Poor decision making.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.967
I don’t know that
Caroline’s competitors

11:28.000 --> 11:31.700
realize that the entirety
of her aesthetic

11:31.734 --> 11:33.700
from extensions
to ripped jeans,

11:33.734 --> 11:35.233
is a deliberate,
uh, joke choice.

11:36.400 --> 11:37.500
Yeah, the whole
thing’s a bit.

11:37.533 --> 11:39.467
Like hi, I don’t
have prostitute hair!

11:39.500 --> 11:41.533
I’m wearing my daughter’s
clothes because I thought it

11:41.567 --> 11:45.767
was funny cos it says ‘one size
fits all’ which it doesn’t!

11:45.800 --> 11:48.200
I have my freaking
stomach showing

11:48.233 --> 11:51.200
and my back fat
hanging out.

11:51.233 --> 11:53.400
And no one
mentioned it!

11:53.433 --> 11:54.867
What was I thinking?

11:55.100 --> 11:56.533
Is this it? Am
I the last one?

11:56.567 --> 11:57.533
One more.

12:00.467 --> 12:01.867
Holy shit.

12:01.900 --> 12:05.934
I mean, you know, we’re
not worthy fucking shit here.

12:05.967 --> 12:06.600
Ladies and gentlemen,

12:06.633 --> 12:08.300
Dave Foley from The
Kids in the Hall.

12:11.900 --> 12:14.800
Ohhh!

12:14.834 --> 12:16.266
Are you
kidding me?

12:16.300 --> 12:18.633
Dave!

12:18.667 --> 12:22.033
Dave and The Kids in
the Hall taught me what

12:22.066 --> 12:24.734
comedy is.

12:24.767 --> 12:29.000
Like, he’s one of the funniest
people in the world?

12:29.633 --> 12:32.834
This is gonna
be so easy!

12:34.667 --> 12:37.033
Fortunately, I’m
not a fan of comedy.

12:37.066 --> 12:39.800
So I think that gives
me an advantage.

12:39.834 --> 12:42.734
I mean I’ve worked with The
Kids in the Hall for 35 years

12:42.767 --> 12:45.900
and they’ve never
made me laugh.

12:45.934 --> 12:47.333
How are you?

12:47.367 --> 12:48.300
Good to see you!

12:48.333 --> 12:50.000
I don’t enjoy
sketch comedy.

12:50.033 --> 12:51.533
I don’t enjoy
stand-up comedy.

12:51.567 --> 12:53.433
Oh, I really don’t
enjoy improv comedy.

12:53.467 --> 12:55.233
Can’t abide
political humor.

12:55.266 --> 12:56.767
Can’t stand
toilet humor.

12:56.800 --> 12:59.166
Dark humor... uninteresting.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.200
Character work... uninteresting.

13:01.233 --> 13:02.734
Prop humor,
I hate.

13:02.767 --> 13:04.800
Eh, Roasting,
don’t like that.

13:04.834 --> 13:06.667
You name it...
Don’t enjoy it.

13:07.300 --> 13:08.400
This is the
dream team...

13:08.433 --> 13:09.233
This is it!

13:09.266 --> 13:09.800
This
is everybody.

13:09.834 --> 13:11.500
Alright!

13:11.533 --> 13:14.367
Look at this.
Look at this. I love it.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.533
My heart, just, is filled
with happiness watching

13:16.567 --> 13:17.934
all of them together.

13:18.200 --> 13:19.100
Are we on television
right now?

13:19.133 --> 13:19.667
I think so yeah.

13:19.700 --> 13:21.100
There’s
cameras in here.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.400
They got all
the hidden cameras.

13:22.433 --> 13:24.500
Ten
comedians in a room.

13:24.533 --> 13:25.633
It’s gonna
be a lot.

13:25.667 --> 13:27.934
I wanna, I wanna
say chaos?

13:27.967 --> 13:29.367
I’m wearing
a camera catheter.

13:30.700 --> 13:32.667
I think this
is going to be...

13:32.700 --> 13:35.500
really interesting.

13:35.533 --> 13:38.567
Someone’s gonna take
a shit in there.

13:38.967 --> 13:40.834
Let’s get
this party started.

13:42.600 --> 13:44.100
Alright...

13:44.133 --> 13:46.066
Holy fuck, that’s
a lot of smoke.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.333
Okay, here we go.

13:48.367 --> 13:51.333
Time to lay down the
law with these fuckers.

13:52.300 --> 13:53.400
Oh shit, guys.

13:53.433 --> 13:54.567
Something’s
happening here.

13:55.900 --> 13:57.333
Oh, hello!

13:57.433 --> 13:58.800
Ohhh!

13:59.834 --> 14:01.133
Here he comes!

14:01.166 --> 14:02.934
Yay!

14:02.967 --> 14:04.166
Oh Jay Baruchel!

14:04.200 --> 14:06.433
Baruchel! Baruchel!

14:06.467 --> 14:07.000
Hello!

14:07.033 --> 14:07.500
How are ya?

14:07.533 --> 14:07.967
Good.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.266
Hey buddy,
good to see ya.

14:10.300 --> 14:12.500
What an entrance!

14:12.533 --> 14:14.233
Um, how’s
everybody doing?

14:14.266 --> 14:16.033
Answer at the
same time.

14:19.834 --> 14:22.467
I’m super giggly so I think
I’m gonna be out fast.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.100
We all think we’re gonna
be out fast. That’s the thing.

14:25.133 --> 14:28.033
I know if there’s
anything comedians

14:28.066 --> 14:30.700
like, it’s fucking rules.

14:30.734 --> 14:32.166
So let’s get right to it.

14:32.200 --> 14:35.400
Basically, there’s one main
rule and that’s do not laugh.

14:35.867 --> 14:37.467
When you
hear this sound...

14:40.734 --> 14:41.567
...the clock starts.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.667
Don’t laugh at each other,
don’t laugh at yourself by

14:43.700 --> 14:46.800
accident, don’t try to hide
a laugh and don’t laugh when

14:46.834 --> 14:49.967
I randomly mess with you from
the comfort of my lodge,

14:50.000 --> 14:52.266
where I will be watching
you all like a creepy hawk.

14:53.300 --> 14:54.166
Uh oh.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.433
If I catch someone laughing...

14:56.467 --> 15:00.100
or even break into a fucking
smile, then this will happen...

15:03.266 --> 15:04.166
Oh...

15:04.200 --> 15:05.200
I’m not
gonna make it.

15:05.233 --> 15:06.266
Oh man...

15:06.300 --> 15:09.333
The game will stop and
I will come back to give

15:09.367 --> 15:12.066
the guilty party
one of these!

15:12.700 --> 15:14.266
They’re beautiful!

15:14.300 --> 15:15.867
Naturally inspired
by Canada’s

15:15.900 --> 15:18.066
favourite pastime... soccer.

15:19.233 --> 15:21.500
If it’s your first time,
you get the yellow card.

15:21.533 --> 15:22.667
That’s your warning.

15:22.700 --> 15:25.333
If I catch you a second
time, you get the red card.

15:25.367 --> 15:27.633
That means you’re
fucking out. Um...

15:27.667 --> 15:29.166
Jay, will there be
cussing all the way

15:29.200 --> 15:30.333
through this show?

15:30.367 --> 15:32.800
They’re humoring
me so I don’t know

15:32.834 --> 15:34.433
what your guys’
rules are.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.567
I don’t work blue!

15:37.934 --> 15:40.166
Now, obviously as
Canadian entertainers,

15:40.200 --> 15:42.633
we’re all used to big time
showbiz treatment.

15:42.667 --> 15:47.233
So we made this late
night stage to perform on.

15:48.333 --> 15:51.867
Complete with our
own LOL late night band!

15:51.900 --> 15:54.800
Okay! Okay.

15:54.834 --> 15:57.734
So this is where the
black people are!

15:57.767 --> 15:59.200
This is where they've
been hiding them!

16:00.133 --> 16:01.266
That’s fun!

16:01.300 --> 16:04.000
Finally, as you
all know, or literally

16:04.033 --> 16:05.567
why would you be doing
this to yourself.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.400
The last one laughing
wins one hundred

16:07.433 --> 16:08.767
thousand dollars
for their charity.

16:09.333 --> 16:11.400
I didn’t know
this was for charity...

16:11.433 --> 16:15.667
Yeah... If you need me,
I’ll be eavesdropping and,

16:15.700 --> 16:17.367
uh, watching you all.

16:17.400 --> 16:18.500
Have fun and
good luck.

16:18.533 --> 16:19.700
Exit to lodge!

16:20.033 --> 16:21.934
Alright.

16:28.600 --> 16:31.066
Alright, not
bad! Not bad.

16:31.100 --> 16:35.567
Um... I became incredibly aware
of my own forehead sweat about

16:35.600 --> 16:39.300
ten percent of the way into
that so, that became...

16:39.333 --> 16:40.700
oh, see much
colder in here!

16:40.734 --> 16:41.667
See ya!

16:45.900 --> 16:47.233
Alright. Alright
that’s enough.

16:47.266 --> 16:48.033
That’s enough music.

16:48.066 --> 16:48.834
Stop playing music.

16:48.867 --> 16:50.834
Stop, stop playing music.

16:50.867 --> 16:52.333
Stop playing music.

16:52.967 --> 16:54.066
I’m scared.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.567
Is Jay gonna come back
and introduce the host?

16:59.433 --> 17:00.934
What the fuck
is that shade?

17:00.967 --> 17:02.700
Don't we all find this absurd,
what we’re doing?

17:02.734 --> 17:03.867
Yes. Yes.

17:03.900 --> 17:04.633
The craziest.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.533
Oh, a little train!

17:07.567 --> 17:08.233
I like trains!

17:08.266 --> 17:10.367
But I didn’t know
what it was about.

17:10.400 --> 17:13.934
I don’t remember anything
about a train being mentioned.

17:16.533 --> 17:17.600
It started.

17:20.233 --> 17:22.000
That means
it started.

17:26.834 --> 17:27.400
Okay.

17:27.433 --> 17:28.400
It started!

17:29.000 --> 17:30.633
♪ Jesus... ♪

17:30.667 --> 17:32.333
Are we starting? I
guess so, right?

17:36.133 --> 17:38.000
♪ Jesus... ♪

17:40.567 --> 17:44.367
Don’t smile Dave!
Already smirkin’.

17:49.967 --> 17:51.300
Oh.

17:51.834 --> 17:56.000
This whole thing
is so fucking ridiculous!

17:56.567 --> 17:58.000
I want that to stop.

18:00.867 --> 18:02.233
Y’all, we're just good
with gettin’ started.

18:02.266 --> 18:03.633
Now
the fun begins!

18:03.667 --> 18:04.700
Thank you band!

18:09.266 --> 18:11.100
Okay...

18:11.133 --> 18:13.533
Okay, I have to remember
that I’m not supposed to laugh.

18:13.567 --> 18:15.200
Yeah, that’s
the main part.

18:18.600 --> 18:21.633
I have to
get away from you.

18:21.667 --> 18:22.800
I’m just getting
away from Deb.

18:22.834 --> 18:24.133
Yeah, yeah.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.266
They haven't even done
the red light thing yet so...

18:28.300 --> 18:28.867
No!

18:28.900 --> 18:29.867
We’re still allowed
to laugh now.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.967
No, it’s started, Tom!

18:32.000 --> 18:34.734
Whence it starts,
then we laugh.

18:34.767 --> 18:37.000
and it's who can
laugh the longest.

18:37.633 --> 18:40.600
I thought it was
when the red light goes...

18:40.633 --> 18:42.367
You start laughing
and then it’s who

18:42.400 --> 18:43.400
can laugh
the longest.

18:43.433 --> 18:44.367
So we’re not
allowed to laugh now?

18:44.400 --> 18:45.333
Last one laughing
is the person who

18:45.367 --> 18:46.767
could laugh
the longest.

18:49.000 --> 18:49.767
Was no one listening?

18:49.800 --> 18:51.433
I wasn’t listening at
all during the rules.

18:51.467 --> 18:53.000
It was like the specials
at a restaurant.

18:53.033 --> 18:54.100
I heard nothing.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.333
Look, we only have five hours
and fifty-eight minutes left.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.100
As soon as
the game started,

19:04.133 --> 19:06.800
I felt like a hysteria beginning.

19:06.834 --> 19:08.333
Just making
eye contact with

19:08.367 --> 19:10.300
people makes
me laugh.

19:10.333 --> 19:13.500
There were threats at every
turn, I can’t explain.

19:13.533 --> 19:14.700
Nowhere is safe!

19:27.367 --> 19:29.567
No... you get
away from me.

19:30.467 --> 19:34.300
What are you
getting? Weiner?

19:34.900 --> 19:36.533
Yeah. It’s been a while.

19:39.767 --> 19:40.967
Jesus Murphy.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.233
5 minutes in and
Mae’s already just

19:42.266 --> 19:43.800
a tarp flailing
in the wind.

19:44.300 --> 19:45.967
What can I do with it?

19:47.667 --> 19:48.734
What can I do with it?

19:49.633 --> 19:51.700
Well I can do alot with it,
but I’m not gonna do it.

19:51.734 --> 19:52.834
It’s not that
kind of show.

20:00.433 --> 20:03.133
This situation...
it’s absurd.

20:03.166 --> 20:06.433
I felt like I should, eh,
just get the ball rolling

20:06.467 --> 20:09.734
and sort of establish
that you can go

20:09.767 --> 20:12.700
way too far at
the very beginning

20:12.734 --> 20:16.367
and they’ll
probably cut it out.

20:20.967 --> 20:24.633
Hello. Yep...

20:26.967 --> 20:28.767
Yeah, I can
do that, Jay.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.166
Hey everyone!

20:31.200 --> 20:32.967
Everyone, just,
eh, quickly.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.367
I have Jay,
yeah, hold on.

20:35.667 --> 20:36.700
No, you don’t.

20:36.734 --> 20:39.567
Yeah, yeah. These
go directly to Jay. Yeah.

20:39.600 --> 20:42.300
Okay, I could...yeah,
I’ll do that. Okay.

20:42.834 --> 20:43.834
No. You’re acting.

20:43.867 --> 20:44.934
This is acting.

20:44.967 --> 20:46.000
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

20:46.033 --> 20:46.633
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:46.667 --> 20:48.333
No, I’ll do it now.
Okay, alright.

20:48.734 --> 20:52.500
Um, eh, so Jay has
made a final request.

20:52.533 --> 20:54.166
He forgot to say it
while he was in here.

20:54.200 --> 20:57.200
Um, we all know how
the internet works.

20:58.934 --> 21:01.533
One little controversial
thing happens here,

21:01.567 --> 21:03.133
it’s all anyone’s
gonna talk about.

21:03.166 --> 21:07.066
Well Jay really wants to keep
the focus on Canadian comedy.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.100
Um, and the charities
we’re here to represent,

21:09.133 --> 21:10.934
so on that note...

21:10.967 --> 21:15.100
Um, he has requested that while
the cameras are filming that we,

21:15.133 --> 21:19.300
they’re not filming yet,um...
That we just don’t mention

21:19.333 --> 21:23.266
his, eh, close, personal
friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.066
It’s just, if we say that
kind of thing here, it’s just

21:30.100 --> 21:32.266
all people are gonna talk
about is like how many

21:32.300 --> 21:34.667
times did he go
to the island?

21:35.233 --> 21:36.934
That’s an asterisk.
That’s a joke!

21:36.967 --> 21:39.133
Um, you know, how
close were they?

21:39.166 --> 21:39.900
They were bros.

21:39.934 --> 21:41.734
Like it doesn’t
really matter.

21:42.033 --> 21:43.567
It’s just fun to
fuck with Jay, right?

21:43.600 --> 21:46.667
He’s like the
sweetest, nicest guy.

21:46.700 --> 21:48.533
And we all know
I’m the psycho.

21:48.567 --> 21:49.667
So Jay appreciates it.

21:49.700 --> 21:51.066
Hold on, hold
on, hold on.

21:51.533 --> 21:52.166
Hey dude.

21:52.200 --> 21:54.133
This is such a dumb bit.

21:54.166 --> 21:57.166
Yeah, it was word for
word what you said.

21:57.200 --> 21:59.200
Okay. Okay, buddy.

21:59.233 --> 22:00.400
Yeah, I’ll see you later.

22:00.433 --> 22:01.567
Alright.

22:02.233 --> 22:06.300
Oh my God.
Jon was hilarious.

22:06.333 --> 22:07.900
I was teetering
on the brink.

22:07.934 --> 22:09.333
I’m worried
that if I win,

22:09.367 --> 22:09.934
Yeah.

22:09.967 --> 22:11.567
I accidently
selected as my charity

22:11.600 --> 22:14.333
The Holocaust Denial
Defense Fund.

22:17.467 --> 22:19.033
Because I thought it was
defending us against

22:19.066 --> 22:20.333
Holocaust deniers.

22:20.367 --> 22:21.767
Apparently, that’s
not what they do.

22:22.166 --> 22:23.500
Right... right...

22:25.800 --> 22:27.133
That's nice.

22:27.166 --> 22:28.233
Thank you.

22:28.266 --> 22:32.667
You’ve been awfully
quiet over here, Trevor.

22:32.700 --> 22:34.600
You didn’t break at
that Epstein bit.

22:34.633 --> 22:35.300
Nope.

22:35.333 --> 22:37.266
I had the glasses on so I
was having trouble focusing.

22:37.300 --> 22:40.300
Yeah. Yeah.... Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah. Ok...

22:40.333 --> 22:43.033
That shouldn’t be
funny, Trevor, but it is.

22:43.934 --> 22:47.000
Hey, uh, they didn’t
say anything, um, but

22:47.033 --> 22:51.133
I’m wondering... if I
have to do a caca?

22:51.166 --> 22:52.467
Do I? I go in there?

22:52.500 --> 22:53.300
You can use
that one, yeah.

22:53.333 --> 22:54.700
It is a working toilet.

22:54.734 --> 22:55.600
Caca? Caca
out of my butt?

22:55.633 --> 22:56.533
There is the TP.

22:56.567 --> 23:01.133
Oh God.
Toilet humour.

23:01.433 --> 23:02.934
Suppose that was
always gonna happen.

23:03.734 --> 23:05.967
I think I might have
to do a caca at some point.

23:06.333 --> 23:08.433
I'm nervous about
the deuce as well.

23:08.467 --> 23:12.800
I uh... I'm not subtle or
kind with my shitting.

23:13.200 --> 23:14.767
You just let us know
when you have to do a caca.

23:14.800 --> 23:15.967
You’ll know. You’ll know.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.767
It’ll be a loud,
loud, furious event.

23:18.800 --> 23:21.300
Okay. Alright.
Alright, alright.

23:21.633 --> 23:24.166
I laugh at everything. I
laugh at the dumbest things.

23:24.200 --> 23:27.233
So this is a
nightmare for me.

23:27.567 --> 23:28.100
I’m stressed.

23:28.133 --> 23:30.033
So my hemorrhoids
are acting up so...

23:30.066 --> 23:32.500
Oh, bro! You and me both!

23:32.533 --> 23:33.133
Yeah.

23:33.166 --> 23:34.767
Bro, up top.

23:34.800 --> 23:35.367
Yeah.

23:35.400 --> 23:36.333
That’s what
I’m talking about.

23:36.367 --> 23:37.367
Hemorrhoid
brothers, yep.

23:37.400 --> 23:38.834
My monthly
visitor I call em.

23:38.867 --> 23:40.567
Mmm hmm.

23:40.600 --> 23:43.133
Keep. It. Together.

23:43.433 --> 23:44.333
I tee’d this up.

23:44.367 --> 23:45.834
I don’t know why I
did this to myself.

23:45.867 --> 23:48.100
I’m gonna walk
away right now.

23:48.133 --> 23:49.133
Yup. Yup.

23:49.166 --> 23:50.367
Because we’re
getting close.

23:50.400 --> 23:51.266
Yup.

23:51.300 --> 23:55.600
Mmm mmm. Trevor and Jon
are barely holding it in.

23:55.633 --> 23:58.667
My boyfriend has a V.B.P.

23:59.033 --> 24:00.533
- I don’t know what that means.
- -What’s V .
- B P.?

24:00.567 --> 24:02.734
My vision board penis.

24:03.333 --> 24:06.166
Stop. It. Right now.

24:09.333 --> 24:10.834
What is
your ideal penis?

24:10.867 --> 24:11.433
You know what?

24:11.467 --> 24:13.834
If it was a Starbucks, you
would want it to be a grande.

24:13.867 --> 24:14.533
Oh right, okay.

24:14.567 --> 24:17.266
And if they had girth-ay,
you would want girth-ay.

24:17.300 --> 24:19.600
Right? As a cup.

24:20.533 --> 24:22.166
That’s
fucking funny.

24:22.567 --> 24:25.967
Caroline, Dave and Tom
were the dangers for me cos

24:26.000 --> 24:27.700
we’ve been around
for a while.

24:27.734 --> 24:30.400
We know how to
exploit weakness.

24:31.100 --> 24:32.367
Family meeting.

24:32.400 --> 24:33.133
Why is there a
family meeting?

24:33.166 --> 24:34.333
I wanna be in the family.

24:34.767 --> 24:37.367
This looks like a
Canadian family meeting.

24:37.400 --> 24:38.834
Next to hot unabomber.

24:39.734 --> 24:41.767
Nicest thing anyone’s
ever said to me.

24:45.100 --> 24:45.734
Can I tell ya?

24:45.767 --> 24:47.767
I’m thinking the guy I am
dating is too young for me.

24:49.533 --> 24:52.133
Thomas Green
with the plastic poop.

24:52.166 --> 24:53.934
We’ve hit the
poo portion.

24:53.967 --> 24:55.467
Already into shit.

24:57.200 --> 25:00.533
Oh! This is close!

25:00.567 --> 25:01.934
Who’s gonna break?

25:02.367 --> 25:02.867
Hello.

25:02.900 --> 25:03.567
WHAT!

25:03.600 --> 25:04.567
Ah. Huh.

25:04.600 --> 25:07.400
Oh, I suffer from
hyperekplexia so

25:07.433 --> 25:08.500
I startle really easy.

25:09.033 --> 25:09.567
Ah.

25:09.600 --> 25:11.300
Yeah, it's just a...

25:11.333 --> 25:12.567
Good to know.

25:12.600 --> 25:15.934
I’m not a big laugher but
I've been, I’ve had a chagrined

25:15.967 --> 25:17.767
expression since
the age of twelve.

25:18.100 --> 25:20.100
I get vague
sadness from you.

25:20.133 --> 25:21.467
That’s my
resting face.

25:23.667 --> 25:27.166
I saw it!

25:27.200 --> 25:28.300
Uh oh!

25:29.433 --> 25:31.533
I did not!

25:32.233 --> 25:33.400
Uh
oh, who was it?

25:33.433 --> 25:35.166
I think that just
means the band comes out.

25:35.967 --> 25:37.200
I think they know
what this means!

25:42.100 --> 25:43.600
Time to be the bad guy.

25:47.700 --> 25:49.433
Embarrassing!
Embarrassing!

25:50.100 --> 25:51.233
Really embarrassing guys.

25:51.500 --> 25:52.667
What are we,
twenty minutes in?

25:55.433 --> 25:59.100
So yeah, I’ll direct all of
your collective attentions,

25:59.133 --> 26:00.767
eh, towards
the monitor.

26:04.266 --> 26:04.967
Hello.

26:05.000 --> 26:05.667
WHAT!

26:05.700 --> 26:06.734
Ah. Huh.

26:06.767 --> 26:09.166
Oh, I suffer
from hyperekplexia

26:09.200 --> 26:11.066
so I startle
really easy.

26:11.100 --> 26:12.800
Ah. Good to know.

26:12.834 --> 26:15.633
I’m not a big laugher but
I’ve had a chagrined expression

26:15.667 --> 26:18.333
since the age of twelve,
that I’m fighting...

26:21.500 --> 26:22.600
Ohh!

26:22.633 --> 26:24.200
Terrific recovery!

26:24.233 --> 26:26.700
You know, had it not been
videotaped, nobody would

26:26.734 --> 26:28.700
have ever known you
had just laughed!

26:28.734 --> 26:30.934
Um, so...

26:30.967 --> 26:34.266
I thought I saw the
fake poop get a laugh.

26:34.300 --> 26:35.467
I’m
very mad at myself.

26:35.500 --> 26:38.166
Tom Green with
his disarming charm

26:38.200 --> 26:40.667
put down some fake
poo in front of me

26:40.700 --> 26:42.900
and normally I’d
be like,"are you five?"

26:42.934 --> 26:44.834
And instead
I went "haha".

26:44.867 --> 26:50.166
Cos in this show, I interpreted
that as flirting. Right?

26:50.200 --> 26:51.834
I think that's
pretty obvious.

26:51.867 --> 26:55.233
But wait. It’s not just her.
There’s more!

26:55.266 --> 26:55.900
Oh!

26:55.934 --> 26:58.133
There’s more. One of
you may have thought

26:58.166 --> 26:59.300
you got
away with one.

26:59.333 --> 27:01.800
But we checked
the tape.

27:03.033 --> 27:05.333
Alright.

27:06.333 --> 27:07.867
What is
your ideal penis?

27:07.900 --> 27:08.967
You
know what?

27:09.000 --> 27:10.734
If it was a Starbucks, you
would want it to be a grande.

27:11.066 --> 27:11.734
Okay.

27:11.767 --> 27:12.867
And if
they had girth-ay,

27:12.900 --> 27:15.300
you would want
girth-ay. Right?

27:15.333 --> 27:16.533
As a cup.

27:21.400 --> 27:23.734
Debra, this is for you.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.266
You don’t take it!

27:27.100 --> 27:27.934
So they’re really watching?

27:27.967 --> 27:29.000
Yes, they’re
really watching!

27:29.033 --> 27:30.834
There’s like four hundred
fucking cameras in here!

27:30.867 --> 27:32.233
I thought they
would just be glancing!

27:32.266 --> 27:34.066
While you’re in here, are
we allowed to laugh?

27:34.100 --> 27:34.500
Yes.

27:34.533 --> 27:35.767
Oh, thank God!

27:35.800 --> 27:36.800
Now get your willies out!

27:36.834 --> 27:38.200
Let the fucking dust settle!

27:38.233 --> 27:39.400
Hey, it’s not that
kind of a show.

27:39.433 --> 27:40.567
Everyone, get
your willies out!

27:40.600 --> 27:42.066
But more importantly,
be better! Ok?

27:42.100 --> 27:44.433
- BE. BETTER.
- BE. BETTER.

27:46.533 --> 27:49.266
Oh yeah, I have a
theme! I have a theme!

28:00.533 --> 28:03.100
Ladies and gentlemen,
public domain grunge!

28:03.600 --> 28:05.600
Woo! Yes!

28:06.734 --> 28:09.800
Caroline and Deb get the
yellow card party started,

28:09.834 --> 28:11.834
if they laugh again they’ll
be bounced for good.

28:12.300 --> 28:13.200
Game on babies!

28:15.667 --> 28:16.934
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28:17.133 --> 28:18.166
No!

28:18.200 --> 28:20.233
I see the buzzy
thing in your hand!

28:20.266 --> 28:22.000
Oh no, it’s
still blue in here. Okay.

28:22.333 --> 28:23.800
It's still blue. No,
if that noise goes off...

28:23.834 --> 28:24.700
There we go.

28:24.734 --> 28:25.433
There it is.

28:25.467 --> 28:26.300
Okay, now
we’re starting.

28:26.333 --> 28:27.667
Now, the laughter dies.

28:28.133 --> 28:29.233
Stop Jon...

28:33.467 --> 28:34.900
Stone face now.
This is it.

28:35.266 --> 28:36.066
Yeah.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.967
So when somebody gets a
warning card, it’s like where

28:40.000 --> 28:42.700
we get to be like a whale
breaching for oxygen.

28:42.734 --> 28:44.033
That’s our moment.

28:44.433 --> 28:45.100
Yeah.

28:45.133 --> 28:46.300
Woah.

28:46.333 --> 28:48.700
Colin, why don’t you
do a pole dance with that pole.

28:49.333 --> 28:49.934
Alright.

28:49.967 --> 28:50.900
Alright?

28:52.967 --> 28:54.934
Why are you, why are
you focusing it on me?

28:54.967 --> 28:56.533
I thought that
was the request?

28:56.567 --> 28:57.433
Eh, Deb wanted it.

28:57.467 --> 29:00.567
No. Nope. I’m fine.

29:05.333 --> 29:07.166
What is that dance
Colin’s doing?

29:07.200 --> 29:08.500
That is godawful.

29:09.467 --> 29:10.033
Oh my God.

29:10.066 --> 29:12.667
That’s nice though cos
it’s romantic. You know?

29:12.700 --> 29:14.033
There's eye contact.

29:14.066 --> 29:15.900
Deb, you are so
without romance that

29:15.934 --> 29:16.967
you think
that’s romantic.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.667
I know, that’s
the problem.

29:18.934 --> 29:20.333
I’ll be honest. I think
there’s a red card

29:20.367 --> 29:21.333
with Debra’s
name on it.

29:26.700 --> 29:28.400
I can pin on a mic cos
I studied broadcasting at

29:28.433 --> 29:29.767
Algonquin College.

29:35.500 --> 29:36.100
Oh good.

29:36.133 --> 29:37.200
Tom’s
father came.

29:37.500 --> 29:38.800
Oh, this is handsome!

29:41.133 --> 29:43.333
Oh boy, funny jacket.
Here we go.

29:43.567 --> 29:44.667
Here we go!

29:44.967 --> 29:46.734
Last One Laughing,
great to be here tonight.

29:46.767 --> 29:49.367
It was hot outside
in Toronto today.

29:53.266 --> 29:54.233
How hot?

29:54.266 --> 29:57.467
It was so hot I saw a
sparrow dipping it’s worm

29:57.500 --> 29:58.967
in a Tim’s ice capp.

30:01.567 --> 30:02.633
No? Anyone?

30:02.667 --> 30:03.834
Hmmm.

30:05.667 --> 30:07.200
I need a little
help here, Orin.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.500
It was eh, hot outside
in, eh, Toronto today.

30:18.667 --> 30:20.033
How hot was it?

30:20.066 --> 30:23.934
It was so hot down at
the reservoir, I saw two rats

30:23.967 --> 30:26.300
water skiing on
popsicle sticks.

30:31.100 --> 30:32.567
Ah, thank you very much!
Okay, well...

30:32.600 --> 30:34.533
Because
they’re small.

30:35.333 --> 30:35.900
Is this thing on?

30:38.834 --> 30:41.967
It was hot outside
in Toronto today, Colin.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.033
How hot was it?

30:43.066 --> 30:45.867
Uh it was so hot this
morning, I had to use five cans

30:45.900 --> 30:49.800
of Right Guard and that
was just on my cab driver!

31:01.100 --> 31:02.200
Heyyyy!

31:02.533 --> 31:03.934
Because he smells.

31:05.467 --> 31:07.867
Tom was sort of
telling the same joke.

31:07.900 --> 31:09.166
It was so hot
in Toronto today.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.133
Over.

31:10.166 --> 31:12.567
It was hot outside
in eh, Toronto today.

31:12.600 --> 31:13.467
And over.

31:13.500 --> 31:14.467
It was so hot out.

31:14.500 --> 31:15.500
And over.

31:15.533 --> 31:17.467
It was eh, hot today.

31:18.867 --> 31:22.734
It goes for way
too long and it gets

31:22.767 --> 31:24.533
so uncomfortable.

31:24.567 --> 31:27.100
It’s so funny cos he’s
so committed to it.

31:27.967 --> 31:32.567
He’s like, I’m making you
feel weird, and that’s funny.

31:33.133 --> 31:35.133
It was so hot, I saw
the Devil at the Walmart

31:35.166 --> 31:37.133
picking up an air
conditioner. Ah!

31:39.467 --> 31:40.834
That’s some wild stuff.

31:40.867 --> 31:42.000
That is wild stuff.

31:43.767 --> 31:45.300
Tough... tough crowd here.

31:46.500 --> 31:48.367
Mae is very
close to slipping.

31:49.066 --> 31:50.800
It was so hot I saw
a squirrel picking up

31:50.834 --> 31:52.266
nuts with pot holders.

31:54.533 --> 31:57.400
I knew early on that Tom
was gonna be my kryptonite.

31:57.433 --> 32:00.633
The repetition and
having the band there.

32:00.667 --> 32:01.900
Oh my God.

32:01.934 --> 32:02.934
That was tough.

32:03.367 --> 32:05.266
They’re good
but shaky, man.

32:06.066 --> 32:08.467
Tough weekend for my
cab driver here in Toronto.

32:08.500 --> 32:11.567
Thanks to illegal fireworks,
he suffered a, eh,

32:11.600 --> 32:13.100
career ending injury.

32:23.166 --> 32:24.834
Wait... no, no, wait for
the punch, Orin.

32:24.867 --> 32:26.100
Wait for the punch.
It’s a good one.

32:26.133 --> 32:27.333
This's a good one.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.400
A cab driver suffered
a career ending injury.

32:31.433 --> 32:33.333
He blew his
middle finger off.

32:38.033 --> 32:38.934
Alright! Thank
you very much.

32:38.967 --> 32:39.800
Thank you
very much.

32:39.834 --> 32:41.200
Tough crowd here.

32:41.700 --> 32:42.834
What are we gonna do?

32:43.667 --> 32:45.166
Close. Very,
very close.

32:45.700 --> 32:47.567
Forgot how much I
love terrible jokes.

32:48.934 --> 32:49.800
Damn it.

32:50.033 --> 32:53.333
C’mon, lets keep
it going, band!

32:53.367 --> 32:54.333
Give me a C minor!

32:54.367 --> 32:56.867
C’mon! Wooo!

32:57.266 --> 33:00.367
Let’s bring up the
party up in here!

33:00.633 --> 33:02.967
Let's have
some FUNNNNNNN!

33:10.166 --> 33:11.767
Oh shit. They’re
covering their mouths

33:11.800 --> 33:13.266
left, right and center.

33:13.300 --> 33:14.200
They can’t do that.

33:14.600 --> 33:15.734
WOOO!

33:16.433 --> 33:17.300
C’mon now
everybody!

33:17.333 --> 33:18.467
Sing along, you
know the words!

33:31.800 --> 33:33.200
I don’t even
know what we’re doing!

33:33.233 --> 33:34.900
What are we
doing here?

33:35.600 --> 33:37.967
What are we
doing here?

33:38.000 --> 33:39.133
WOOO!

33:41.100 --> 33:42.467
Woah!

33:42.767 --> 33:45.467
Holy shit! She just
fucking bottled him!

33:47.600 --> 33:49.900
Oh shit.

33:49.934 --> 33:52.734
Mae’s not
fucking around.

33:52.967 --> 33:54.000
So what?

33:54.367 --> 33:55.734
Is everything breakaway?

33:56.100 --> 33:56.900
Let me try this one.

33:58.567 --> 33:59.967
Uh oh!

34:00.066 --> 34:02.266
You pieces of shit.
They can’t do that.

34:02.667 --> 34:04.333
Put ya in the penalty box
as far as I’m concerned!

34:07.300 --> 34:08.100
Uh oh.

34:08.133 --> 34:08.767
Was it you?

34:08.800 --> 34:09.400
That was you.

34:09.433 --> 34:10.266
I don't think so.

34:10.300 --> 34:11.233
It’s not me!

34:11.266 --> 34:13.567
Cannot be me!
I did not do it!

34:16.300 --> 34:19.433
You tell ‘em once, you could
tell ‘em a thousand times.

34:19.467 --> 34:21.867
Can’t teach people
how to listen!

34:23.033 --> 34:24.066
Am I out?

34:24.567 --> 34:25.533
Um...

34:25.567 --> 34:26.934
I’m
out. I laughed?

34:26.967 --> 34:28.567
There was
an infraction.

34:28.867 --> 34:30.166
Two infractions
in fact.

34:30.633 --> 34:31.233
Oh my God.

34:31.266 --> 34:33.200
Everyone just
watch the fucking TV.

34:33.467 --> 34:34.433
Uh oh...

34:35.100 --> 34:36.633
I hope those
are not your nipples.

34:36.667 --> 34:39.533
I look around and the
icons that I’m watching

34:39.567 --> 34:41.300
are all friggin’
like rockstars.

34:41.333 --> 34:42.333
Ya know,
fucking titans.

34:42.367 --> 34:44.100
They’re all very funny.

34:44.133 --> 34:45.567
I am in the
middle of a joke.

34:45.600 --> 34:48.467
You’re in this situation,
and l start thinking

34:48.500 --> 34:49.867
“I think I’m
on mushrooms”.

34:49.900 --> 34:51.400
Oh my God.

34:51.433 --> 34:54.000
Mae likes my
cheese sandwiches.

34:54.033 --> 34:55.133
Nowhere is safe!

34:55.166 --> 34:56.867
Woah!

34:56.900 --> 34:58.500
What the fuck?

34:58.533 --> 35:01.133
That’s like a
Twilight Zone episode.

35:03.066 --> 35:06.900
Ladies and gentlemen. The
first red card of the game.

35:09.433 --> 35:10.533
What the
fuck is this show?
