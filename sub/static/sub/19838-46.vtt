00:02.990 --> 00:05.960
<b>Three days remain until the selection begins.</b>

00:06.500 --> 00:10.080
<b>In the palace, the King has 
completed his recovery,</b>

00:10.080 --> 00:12.860
<b>and continues to play Gungi without rest.</b>

00:17.240 --> 00:18.120
<b>That's checkmate.</b>

00:26.620 --> 00:29.380
<b><i>Her mind and body are at their limit.</i></b>

00:29.940 --> 00:33.900
<b><i>I estimate it will only take another 
match or two before the King wins.</i></b>

01:55.010 --> 02:00.010
<b>Gungi x Of x Komugi</b>

02:04.300 --> 02:05.510
<b>Time for a break.</b>

02:05.510 --> 02:07.220
<b>We will resume in a half day.</b>

02:09.400 --> 02:11.580
<b>Wait, I can keep going!</b>

02:11.580 --> 02:15.170
<b>If you can barely sit straight, 
the victory won't satisfy me.</b>

02:16.170 --> 02:18.050
<b>Recover your strength.</b>

02:25.530 --> 02:30.000
<b><i>Even while his arm was being treated, 
the King never stopped playing.</i></b>

02:30.470 --> 02:32.670
<b><i>But now he changes his mind?</i></b>

02:36.750 --> 02:39.260
<b><i>This female is dangerous.</i></b>

02:40.990 --> 02:42.260
<b><i>If this continues,</i></b>

02:43.830 --> 02:45.700
<b><i>she could prove quite troublesome...</i></b>

03:00.950 --> 03:03.780
<b>Then, I will excuse myself.</b>

03:10.800 --> 03:12.420
<b><i>I must not be too hasty.</i></b>

03:13.180 --> 03:15.450
<b><i>The King chose to retract his decree.</i></b>

03:16.060 --> 03:18.230
<b><i>In order to stay true to his convictions...</i></b>

03:19.250 --> 03:21.570
<b><i>In order to defeat the Gungi 
Champion at her best...</i></b>

03:22.010 --> 03:24.430
<b><i>In order to demonstrate his strength!</i></b>

03:25.380 --> 03:28.700
<b><i>If I kill this girl now,</i></b>

03:28.700 --> 03:32.660
<b><i>the King will remain a loser at Gungi forever.</i></b>

03:33.550 --> 03:35.640
<b><i>Her death will cement her status</i></b>

03:36.090 --> 03:39.370
<b><i>as someone the King could never defeat!</i></b>

03:48.650 --> 03:50.350
<b><i>I am such a fool!</i></b>

03:50.760 --> 03:57.320
<b><i>My hasty impulse could have left 
the King with a permanent scar!</i></b>

04:09.700 --> 04:12.380
<b><i>I shall die of my own volition!</i></b>

04:13.270 --> 04:16.520
<b><i>Once I have seen the King conquer the world...</i></b>

04:25.420 --> 04:29.340
<b>Using Knov-san's Apartment Complex, 
seven people will infiltrate the palace.</b>

04:30.050 --> 04:31.480
<b>Shoot and me...</b>

04:31.480 --> 04:33.180
<b>Gon, Killua,</b>

04:33.180 --> 04:35.220
<b>Meleoron, Ikalgo,</b>

04:35.220 --> 04:37.340
<b>and then Morel.</b>

04:37.910 --> 04:40.590
<b>A few seconds after us,</b>

04:40.590 --> 04:43.170
<b>the Chairman will enter from beyond Pitou's <i>En</i>.</b>

04:43.490 --> 04:48.300
<b>During that time, we must draw 
the Royal Guard from the King.</b>

04:48.850 --> 04:51.680
<b>Gon, Killua, and Ikalgo will go in first.</b>

04:52.780 --> 04:56.170
<b>When we suddenly appear 
in the midst of the palace,</b>

04:56.170 --> 04:59.520
<b>their immediate reaction will be...</b>

05:00.180 --> 05:02.290
<b>To protect the King with their lives.</b>

05:02.930 --> 05:04.790
<b>They'll probably use a formation like this.</b>

05:05.820 --> 05:07.940
<b>Breaking it won't be easy.</b>

05:09.580 --> 05:11.950
<b>And that's where I come in.</b>

05:31.990 --> 05:34.330
<b>Okay, any questions?</b>

05:34.330 --> 05:36.850
<b>Uh, about Palm...</b>

05:37.480 --> 05:40.440
<b>Can we do anything to learn 
what's happened to her?</b>

05:41.000 --> 05:43.650
<b>She's either dead or in hiding.</b>

05:44.160 --> 05:46.200
<b>If she'd gotten out, she'd have contacted us.</b>

05:46.200 --> 05:48.240
<b>Since she hasn't, that's the only explanation.</b>

05:49.700 --> 05:53.070
<b>If she were captured, 
she'd have taken her own life.</b>

05:53.620 --> 05:56.160
<b>When she left, she was prepared for that.</b>

05:56.480 --> 06:02.290
<b>If we try to check in on her, 
it would be an insult to her resolve.</b>

06:03.420 --> 06:05.260
<b>Hey, you're being too harsh!</b>

06:05.260 --> 06:07.880
<b>Gon's just concerned about Palm.</b>

06:07.880 --> 06:10.380
<b>And his concern is worthless.</b>

06:10.380 --> 06:11.300
<b>What's that?!</b>

06:11.620 --> 06:14.180
<b>You just came back! Where do you get off?!</b>

06:14.180 --> 06:17.840
<b>Assuming that Palm was captured alive,</b>

06:17.840 --> 06:21.190
<b>it would mean the enemy knows our plan.</b>

06:21.530 --> 06:26.410
<b>Which would make us like moths 
flying straight into the flame.</b>

06:26.810 --> 06:28.200
<b>We'll be destroyed instantly.</b>

06:29.050 --> 06:32.290
<b>But instead of worrying about worst-case scenarios,</b>

06:32.290 --> 06:34.560
<b>what's important is that we trust Palm.</b>

06:35.110 --> 06:37.330
<b>Well, that certainly makes sense,</b>

06:37.800 --> 06:40.380
<b>but Gon's point might be that,</b>

06:40.380 --> 06:44.840
<b>if Palm has met such a fate, we still 
have time to change the plan.</b>

06:45.130 --> 06:45.840
<b>Think again.</b>

06:46.730 --> 06:51.790
<b>He'll say that we have to save Palm first.</b>

06:52.240 --> 06:54.970
<b>But he won't offer any plans for that.</b>

06:55.200 --> 06:55.930
<b>Right?</b>

06:55.930 --> 06:57.510
<b>R-Right...</b>

06:58.790 --> 07:01.210
<b>I see your point...</b>

07:02.080 --> 07:04.160
<b>I know you're worried,</b>

07:04.160 --> 07:07.230
<b>but once the operation starts, 
you'll have to forget her until we're done.</b>

07:07.750 --> 07:11.650
<b>If you're distracted for a fraction of a second,</b>

07:11.650 --> 07:15.240
<b>that might cause our operation to fail.</b>

07:16.180 --> 07:17.500
<b>We still have two days...</b>

07:17.970 --> 07:20.670
<b>There's still time for Palm to contact us.</b>

07:29.830 --> 07:31.260
<b><i>Nyow</i> I understand.</b>

07:37.030 --> 07:39.880
<b>Should I have tried to escape to the right?</b>

07:40.280 --> 07:42.020
<b>You should have moved your knight.</b>

07:42.660 --> 07:47.680
<b>I didn't want to let a single piece 
control the center of the board.</b>

07:48.360 --> 07:52.320
<b>Sometimes, you must accept 
the risk and move forward.</b>

07:53.080 --> 07:57.080
<b>Otherwise, you won't ever be 
able to make me hesitate.</b>

07:58.960 --> 08:01.210
<b>I am unaccustomed to playing a waiting game.</b>

08:06.230 --> 08:07.210
<b>Your Majesty...</b>

08:07.540 --> 08:08.240
<b>What is it?</b>

08:08.700 --> 08:11.220
<b>I have some sensitive information, 
so we should step outside.</b>

08:12.200 --> 08:13.970
<b>It's fine, speak.</b>

08:15.770 --> 08:19.290
<b>Two days remain until the National Celebration.</b>

08:19.970 --> 08:24.740
<b>The number of citizens to process in Peijing 
has increased beyond our expectations.</b>

08:25.430 --> 08:29.950
<b>But the weather forecast is favorable, 
so the selection should proceed as planned.</b>

08:30.370 --> 08:32.990
<b>Get to the point.</b>

08:33.980 --> 08:36.530
<b>I would like to move up</b>

08:36.530 --> 08:38.400
<b>the post-selection schedule.</b>

08:38.760 --> 08:41.380
<b>That's it? Do as you wish.</b>

08:41.800 --> 08:42.750
<b>Yes, sir.</b>

08:42.750 --> 08:45.870
<b>In that case, we will depart 
immediately after the selectionâ€”</b>

08:46.070 --> 08:47.390
<b>Don't make me repeat myself!</b>

08:48.460 --> 08:50.970
<b>I'm telling you to decide on your own.</b>

08:51.440 --> 08:53.810
<b>Do not return until I summon you.</b>

08:58.870 --> 09:01.390
<b>So you were chased out, too?</b>

09:02.330 --> 09:05.140
<b>Well, we only need to wait for the King to win.</b>

09:06.050 --> 09:09.340
<b>You think that will only be a 
few more matches, right?</b>

09:09.730 --> 09:10.350
<b>No.</b>

09:11.460 --> 09:14.190
<b>Wasn't that what you said a while ago?</b>

09:15.000 --> 09:18.070
<b>The King is improving at a remarkable rate.</b>

09:18.680 --> 09:20.690
<b>However, she is also evolving.</b>

09:22.320 --> 09:25.910
<b>I am no longer able to predict the outcome.</b>

09:27.000 --> 09:30.800
<b>Well, it's still only a matter of 
time before the King wins.</b>

09:31.600 --> 09:32.880
<b>I hope you're right.</b>

09:32.880 --> 09:36.190
<b>I am. There's nothing to worry about.</b>

09:43.310 --> 09:47.060
<b><i>I am one hundred percent confident 
that he's acting on his own...</i></b>

09:48.080 --> 09:51.320
<b><i>The man who defeated Leol.</i></b>

09:52.500 --> 09:55.180
<b><i>The reports from Welfin and Brovada confirm it.</i></b>

09:55.180 --> 09:58.240
<b><i>The soldiers under his control 
are all smoke puppets.</i></b>

09:59.320 --> 10:02.450
<b><i>Since their complex movements 
are not typical of </i>Nen<i> puppets,</i></b>

10:02.450 --> 10:04.970
<b><i>they fooled me as effectively as a smokescreen.</i></b>

10:05.580 --> 10:10.450
<b><i>He can't control as many puppets as I can, 
but his are more responsive.</i></b>

10:13.470 --> 10:15.210
<b>I want to fight him...</b>

10:15.980 --> 10:18.720
<b>But I can't leave my post.</b>

10:18.950 --> 10:21.550
<b>Maybe he'll come to me...</b>

10:28.390 --> 10:31.130
<b><i>It's about time for us to enter Peijing.</i></b>

10:31.130 --> 10:35.830
<b><i>The enemy should have noticed 
Morel's distraction by now.</i></b>

10:37.010 --> 10:39.250
<b><i>We'll make some noise in Peijing to negate</i></b>

10:39.250 --> 10:42.030
<b><i>their belief that this is all the work of one man.</i></b>

10:42.710 --> 10:44.000
<b><i>At the same time,</i></b>

10:44.000 --> 10:47.480
<b><i>many citizens will be moving toward the palace.</i></b>

10:47.860 --> 10:50.540
<b><i>If we disappear the day before the celebration,</i></b>

10:50.540 --> 10:55.630
<b><i>they'll believe assassins are hidden 
among the citizens, trying to kill the King.</i></b>

10:56.550 --> 11:01.050
<b><i>And their focus will be outside 
the palace, on the crowds.</i></b>

11:01.990 --> 11:05.810
<b><i>That's when we enter the palace with 
Four-Dimensional Apartment Complex!</i></b>

11:07.490 --> 11:09.600
<b><i>The King will definitely be here.</i></b>

11:10.220 --> 11:14.780
<b><i>Watching the selection from 
the third-floor throne room.</i></b>

11:17.560 --> 11:19.240
<b><i>Will he really be there?</i></b>

11:20.770 --> 11:21.990
<b><i>Something...</i></b>

11:22.630 --> 11:23.780
<b><i>feels off.</i></b>

11:38.140 --> 11:40.260
<b>2-1-3, pawn.</b>

11:41.930 --> 11:44.010
<b>4-5-1, knight.</b>

11:47.140 --> 11:49.770
<b>8-7-2, lieutenant general.</b>

11:51.830 --> 11:53.770
<b>4-3-3, archer.</b>

11:55.490 --> 11:59.540
<b><i>She continues to attack where 
I'm weak without hesitation.</i></b>

12:00.200 --> 12:02.150
<b><i>As we play, she's getting sharper.</i></b>

12:03.680 --> 12:05.850
<b>2-1-1, knight.</b>

12:08.290 --> 12:10.600
<b>6-6-1, major general.</b>

12:11.210 --> 12:13.370
<b><i>But it does not pain me.</i></b>

12:13.930 --> 12:15.880
<b><i>Rather, I find this enjoyable.</i></b>

12:16.320 --> 12:19.500
<b><i>Because the board dictates my every move.</i></b>

12:20.780 --> 12:26.050
<b><i>Which proves that she is still 
several levels above me.</i></b>

12:27.120 --> 12:29.560
<b><i>How strong can she become?</i></b>

12:31.720 --> 12:33.190
<b>Supreme Leader...</b>

12:34.120 --> 12:35.190
<b>I feel...</b>

12:36.120 --> 12:37.190
<b>strange.</b>

12:46.080 --> 12:47.540
<b>I can't stop.</b>

12:49.160 --> 12:54.850
<b>Marvelous moves keep flooding into my mind...</b>

12:55.610 --> 12:59.100
<b>I can become even better!</b>

13:00.230 --> 13:01.590
<b><i>Has she awakened?</i></b>

13:02.790 --> 13:04.590
<b><i>Then she's only</i></b>

13:05.690 --> 13:07.250
<b><i>begun to grow.</i></b>

13:13.510 --> 13:14.530
<b>That's checkmate.</b>

13:17.300 --> 13:21.110
<b>Could I take a short break?</b>

13:21.930 --> 13:24.430
<b><i>It's the first time she's asked for a break...</i></b>

13:25.470 --> 13:26.800
<b>Is something wrong?</b>

13:27.390 --> 13:33.130
<b>No, I'd like to return to my room to 
record the moves that are in my mind.</b>

13:33.130 --> 13:34.320
<b>But you can't see...</b>

13:34.320 --> 13:38.380
<b>Oh, I'll just move the pieces around the board!</b>

13:38.730 --> 13:42.820
<b>When I touch the pieces after they're placed,</b>

13:42.820 --> 13:45.010
<b>I will never forget their position.</b>

13:45.620 --> 13:47.890
<b><i>She's memorized every placement 
she's ever experienced?</i></b>

13:48.610 --> 13:50.680
<b>Very well, you're excused.</b>

13:50.680 --> 13:51.570
<b>Thank you.</b>

13:53.310 --> 13:54.530
<b><i>A foolish question...</i></b>

13:57.480 --> 13:58.650
<b><i>Her name...</i></b>

14:00.120 --> 14:00.950
<b>Hey.</b>

14:02.080 --> 14:04.650
<b>What is your name?</b>

14:05.780 --> 14:07.470
<b>You mean mine?</b>

14:07.840 --> 14:09.410
<b>Is there anyone else around?</b>

14:10.260 --> 14:12.790
<b>It's K-K-Komugi.</b>

14:13.560 --> 14:14.770
<b>Komugi?</b>

14:16.420 --> 14:17.920
<b>Supreme Leader...</b>

14:18.910 --> 14:21.170
<b>Can you please tell me</b>

14:22.070 --> 14:24.300
<b>what your name is?</b>

14:28.660 --> 14:30.300
<b><i>My name?</i></b>

14:31.660 --> 14:32.550
<b><i>What...</i></b>

14:35.550 --> 14:36.850
<b><i>am I called?</i></b>

14:40.120 --> 14:40.940
<b>Pitou.</b>

14:44.860 --> 14:46.820
<b>Yes, what do you need?</b>

14:48.000 --> 14:48.570
<b>Pouf.</b>

14:49.390 --> 14:50.340
<b>Yes.</b>

14:50.340 --> 14:51.210
<b>Youpi.</b>

14:51.870 --> 14:52.690
<b>Yes.</b>

14:55.430 --> 14:57.030
<b>Is something the matter?</b>

14:57.680 --> 14:58.590
<b>Pouf...</b>

14:58.590 --> 14:59.330
<b>Yes?</b>

14:59.600 --> 15:01.830
<b>Right, you're Pouf.</b>

15:03.700 --> 15:04.750
<b>Then...</b>

15:06.120 --> 15:08.260
<b>What is my name?</b>

15:11.500 --> 15:13.260
<b>I speak with utmost respect, Your Majesty...</b>

15:14.130 --> 15:17.730
<b>You are the King. You have no other name.</b>

15:18.240 --> 15:20.250
<b>You are the one and only King.</b>

15:20.690 --> 15:25.100
<b>At the moment, there are impostors 
using that name without permission,</b>

15:25.100 --> 15:27.520
<b>but we will eliminate them all.</b>

15:28.110 --> 15:33.280
<b>So that the entire world will 
know there is only one King.</b>

15:33.280 --> 15:35.790
<b>That assumes the others can be eliminated.</b>

15:36.240 --> 15:37.790
<b>"King" is a title.</b>

15:38.140 --> 15:41.800
<b>A title can be bestowed, and it is not a name.</b>

15:43.160 --> 15:44.250
<b>What of you, Youpi?</b>

15:45.050 --> 15:47.840
<b>Your question is far beyond my capacity.</b>

15:48.260 --> 15:51.630
<b>I cannot think of a way to provide an answer.</b>

15:52.060 --> 15:52.910
<b>Pitou.</b>

15:53.810 --> 15:58.100
<b>I believe that your feelings 
are what matter most.</b>

15:58.830 --> 16:04.100
<b>You should select the name 
that you find most pleasing.</b>

16:05.810 --> 16:07.230
<b>Very well, then.</b>

16:08.740 --> 16:12.080
<b>You can choose a name after the selection.</b>

16:12.690 --> 16:18.710
<b>Right now, our priority is to finish all the 
preparations before tomorrow morning.</b>

16:21.950 --> 16:23.750
<b>Your Majesty, is something wrong?</b>

16:24.320 --> 16:27.140
<b>If you have any concerns, we shall address them.</b>

16:28.080 --> 16:30.240
<b>That is why we are here.</b>

16:30.860 --> 16:34.730
<b>Komugi's entire body was glowing.</b>

16:34.990 --> 16:36.010
<b>Komugi?</b>

16:36.010 --> 16:37.640
<b>The girl with the closed eyes.</b>

16:40.840 --> 16:42.860
<b><i>He's remembered that human's name.</i></b>

16:43.530 --> 16:45.150
<b>She experienced an awakening.</b>

16:45.840 --> 16:51.000
<b>Komugi will now become much stronger, 
although only at Gungi.</b>

16:52.470 --> 16:53.290
<b>Pitou...</b>

16:53.290 --> 16:54.230
<b>Yes.</b>

16:54.230 --> 16:56.720
<b>If Komugi were put through the selection</b>

16:56.720 --> 17:00.890
<b>that will occur tomorrow, what would happen?</b>

17:00.890 --> 17:02.360
<b>She would die.</b>

17:02.710 --> 17:04.410
<b>The selection chooses humans</b>

17:04.410 --> 17:09.290
<b>with the physical and mental 
strength to serve as soldiers.</b>

17:09.740 --> 17:14.350
<b>The survivors will be those who demonstrate 
excellent combat capabilities.</b>

17:16.830 --> 17:18.680
<b><i>Your Majesty, please...</i></b>

17:19.130 --> 17:20.570
<b>After meeting Komugi,</b>

17:21.180 --> 17:23.730
<b>I've learned that strength can 
manifest in different ways.</b>

17:24.620 --> 17:27.440
<b>For example, during our trip here...</b>

17:27.680 --> 17:30.820
<b><i>Your Majesty, please stop.</i></b>

17:31.160 --> 17:32.840
<b>...I killed a child.</b>

17:32.840 --> 17:35.950
<b><i>Your Majesty, you must not say it...</i></b>

17:36.620 --> 17:38.410
<b>Perhaps that child...</b>

17:38.410 --> 17:40.660
<b><i>It isn't right... It's inappropriate!</i></b>

17:40.660 --> 17:45.120
<b>...had the potential to surpass 
me in a certain field.</b>

17:45.330 --> 17:46.620
<b><i>An almighty King...</i></b>

17:46.960 --> 17:48.790
<b>Yet I extinguished that potential.</b>

17:48.790 --> 17:50.920
<b><i>...can never show regret!</i></b>

17:51.590 --> 17:54.560
<b>I extinguished it for no real reason.</b>

17:54.560 --> 17:57.550
<b><i>You must not say any more!</i></b>

17:59.230 --> 18:00.300
<b>I am...</b>

18:01.880 --> 18:02.770
<b>King!</b>

18:17.110 --> 18:20.450
<b>I took a life for no reason at all...</b>

18:23.290 --> 18:26.400
<b>What tremendous strength I must possess!</b>

18:27.300 --> 18:32.520
<b>I appear with no warning, to rob 
countless beings of their inferior strength!</b>

18:32.900 --> 18:35.290
<b>To crush... To destroy.</b>

18:36.190 --> 18:38.710
<b>That is my power.</b>

18:39.470 --> 18:43.070
<b>Brute force is the strongest 
power in this world!</b>

18:52.160 --> 18:55.200
<b>I am not worthy of being a Royal Guard...</b>

18:55.200 --> 18:55.990
<b>Why not?</b>

18:56.840 --> 18:59.670
<b>I jumped to the wrong conclusion,</b>

18:59.670 --> 19:02.200
<b>and I nearly insulted the King.</b>

19:03.640 --> 19:09.540
<b>I was foolish enough to think that the King 
might have regretted his actions...</b>

19:10.660 --> 19:13.840
<b>You always think too much.</b>

19:13.840 --> 19:16.330
<b>Yes, that is correct.</b>

19:16.330 --> 19:20.890
<b>Well, the King has changed since that girl arrived.</b>

19:21.190 --> 19:23.140
<b>Yes, that is true.</b>

19:23.560 --> 19:27.770
<b>If the girl will impede the King, 
we should kill her.</b>

19:29.420 --> 19:32.650
<b>To think my mind operates 
on the same level as yours...</b>

19:35.130 --> 19:36.400
<b><i>Yes...</i></b>

19:37.360 --> 19:41.410
<b><i>My power is the strongest that exists.</i></b>

19:42.520 --> 19:47.790
<b><i>All other power means nothing
 in the face of my own.</i></b>

19:48.260 --> 19:50.380
<b><i>They are as dust in the wind.</i></b>

19:51.230 --> 19:54.590
<b><i>Komugi... That female is no different.</i></b>

19:55.360 --> 19:59.210
<b><i>Her skill is in Gungi, a simple board game.</i></b>

19:59.900 --> 20:04.180
<b><i>I could turn her into no more than 
a source of meat with the barest touch.</i></b>

20:04.890 --> 20:07.800
<b><i>So her life depends on my mood.</i></b>

20:08.290 --> 20:09.810
<b><i>If I change my mind,</i></b>

20:09.810 --> 20:11.510
<b><i>I can immediately kill her!</i></b>

20:13.280 --> 20:16.820
<b><i>Then why am I so hesitant?</i></b>

20:17.550 --> 20:21.320
<b><i>The goal was to kill time while 
waiting for the selection.</i></b>

20:21.320 --> 20:24.820
<b><i>The selection is tomorrow... 
Haven't I had enough?</i></b>

20:25.040 --> 20:27.850
<b><i>I've had my fun. I no longer need her.</i></b>

20:28.410 --> 20:30.200
<b><i>Do I kill her now?!</i></b>

20:45.140 --> 20:47.680
<b>Th-Thank you very much...</b>

20:47.680 --> 20:48.850
<b>Why did you not call for help?</b>

20:50.330 --> 20:51.120
<b>Here...</b>

20:51.500 --> 20:52.560
<b>And here...</b>

20:52.560 --> 20:53.940
<b>You're covered in blood!</b>

20:54.510 --> 20:56.690
<b><i>Damn, I don't believe it.</i></b>

20:57.660 --> 20:59.820
<b><i>She's such a fragile creature!</i></b>

21:01.040 --> 21:02.920
<b>Because it's still early...</b>

21:04.670 --> 21:08.450
<b>I don't want to bother anyone else.</b>

21:09.170 --> 21:11.450
<b>You aren't bothering anyone.</b>

21:12.770 --> 21:14.460
<b><i>What am...</i></b>

21:15.110 --> 21:16.840
<b>You are an important guest!</b>

21:17.300 --> 21:18.460
<b><i>...I saying?</i></b>

21:19.840 --> 21:22.760
<b><i>Didn't I come here to kill her?</i></b>

21:31.870 --> 21:32.880
<b>Why do you cry?!</b>

21:32.880 --> 21:34.070
<b><i>Why can't I do it?</i></b>

21:34.530 --> 21:36.080
<b>I'm sorry!</b>

21:36.080 --> 21:37.840
<b>But... But...</b>

21:38.250 --> 21:41.230
<b>No one's ever been this nice to me!</b>

21:45.820 --> 21:48.460
<b><i>What is this creature?</i></b>

21:50.410 --> 21:52.240
<b><i>What do I want</i></b>

21:53.410 --> 21:54.730
<b><i>to do with her?</i></b>

23:24.620 --> 23:27.430
<b>Next time: Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.</b>

23:27.720 --> 23:31.790
<b>Killua-sama, all these marvelous ideas 
keep flooding into my mindâ€”</b>

23:31.790 --> 23:34.300
<b>Then we're covered for future preview segments!</b>
