THE ACCOUNTANT: <i>Since the birth of time,</i>

00:36.871 --> 00:41.240
<i>humanity has endeavored</i>
<i>to restrain evil men in prisons.</i>

00:41.509 --> 00:43.739
<i>But since Cain fled</i>
<i>the murder of his brother,</i>

00:43.844 --> 00:46.142
<i>evil men have fled the walls of punishment.</i>

00:47.982 --> 00:50.746
<i>So, it doesn't matter</i>
<i>if you're a badass motherfucker on the run,</i>

00:50.851 --> 00:53.012
<i>because you think</i>
<i>you're better than everyone else,</i>

00:53.120 --> 00:56.612
<i>and somehow entitled</i>
<i>to do what you gotta do.</i>

00:57.224 --> 00:58.486
<i>No.</i>

00:58.659 --> 01:02.425
<i>Because, you see, badass motherfuckers</i>
<i>are never fast enough.</i>

01:33.594 --> 01:35.289
- I think we lost him.
- I swear she said he was dead.

01:35.396 --> 01:36.727
- Keep watching!
- Well, fucking he ain't!

01:38.832 --> 01:41.699

You're too late. You gotta know that, right?

03:43.857 --> 03:46.451
First full moon, she's dead, man.

03:47.394 --> 03:50.852
She's dead and hell's

What? No, Norma Jean. "Buy the cow."
Marry me.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.490
I'm saying he's gotta marry me.
I cut him off.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.499
You cut him off?

05:02.169 --> 05:04.933
- (LAUGHS) Not just yes, but hell, yes!
- (LAUGHING)

05:05.005 --> 05:08.270

"If I see that big ol' dick
anywhere near my face again,

05:10.577 --> 05:13.102
- "I'm gonna bite it in half."
- (LAUGHS) You said that?

05:13.213 --> 05:14.908
PIPER: Yeah, sure did.

05:14.982 --> 05:18.076
Oh, my God. How long has it been?

05:18.285 --> 05:22.119
Oh, two days. But that's like a decade

05:22.222 --> 05:23.746
So, he bought you a diamond?

05:23.857 --> 05:25.688
Oh, God, no.
If Frank had money for a diamond,

05:25.759 --> 05:29.251
I would have jacked his sorry ass ages ago
and put this shit hole in rear view.

05:29.363 --> 05:32.389
But he did get down on one knee
and ask me to be his bride.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.023
- No way! Oh!
- Yes, way!

We'll take this.

"She's a Brickhouse" breakfast.
Ten monster flapjacks for $4.99.

06:00.194 --> 06:02.162
- And three waters.
- All right, and what can I get for...

06:02.262 --> 06:05.322
That's it. Just the pancakes, if that's okay.

06:05.666 --> 06:06.997

Hello, beautiful. Coffee?

06:15.476 --> 06:17.034
Black, with sugar.

06:18.011 --> 06:24.541
Have you ever heard of a Stillwater Marsh
or a Deacon's Tree? In Texas, maybe?

06:24.618 --> 06:26.848
Stillwater Marsh, yeah, I've heard of it,

06:27.521 --> 06:28.749
but it ain't in Texas.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.647
Stillwater is in Louisiana.

06:32.493 --> 06:35.485
Honey, Stillwater is a prison.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.531
My daddy did some time there
before it closed.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.490
I'll get you that coffee.

06:43.437 --> 06:45.530
Here's some muffins and warm milk.

06:45.772 --> 06:47.501
- But we didn't order...
- It's on the house.

06:52.513 --> 06:55.971
So, you gonna ask me
what time my shift ends?

06:56.850 --> 06:58.317
It's a full moon tonight.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.818
I always feel a little randy with a full moon.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.249
Full moon's two days off.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.259
Pretty sure.

07:14.101 --> 07:17.195

07:23.510 --> 07:25.171
I'll be right back with the flapjacks.

07:26.713 --> 07:29.409
Sure. But if you're looking for a ride...

07:42.062 --> 07:43.654
I told you I wanted sugar.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.701
On the house? On the fucking house?

07:51.138 --> 07:53.766
Relax. We gonna
throw them muffins out, anyway.

07:54.908 --> 07:59.675
If they're not gonna pay for them,
somebody's gonna have to pay the price.

08:00.614 --> 08:06.382
I told you, you fat fuck son of a bitch,
never touch me like that again.

08:06.753 --> 08:09.017
- Let go of my balls.
- Shut up.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.116
Muffins are on me. I quit.

08:16.263 --> 08:19.994
Put some honey butter on them muffins.
They'll taste an awful lot better that way.

They took her little girl.

36:34.993 --> 36:38.087
- The little baby everyone's looking for?
- Yes.

36:38.163 --> 36:40.927
They killed my daughter.
They took her baby.

36:48.573 --> 36:49.938
That baby girl is all I got.

36:51.777 --> 36:54.575
She's the last connection to my daughter.

42:18.570 --> 42:21.198
She knew him, yes, yes, she did.

42:21.873 --> 42:24.637
Her world was in a tailspin,

42:24.709 --> 42:27.678
and King was preaching quiet revolution.

42:27.779 --> 42:31.180
It was four months before she realized
"quiet" meant hiding

42:31.282 --> 42:33.614
in a basement,
cutting the heads off of chickens.

42:33.685 --> 42:35.516
Jonah King's into voodoo?

42:35.620 --> 42:37.451
Not voodoo, satanic magic.

42:37.789 --> 42:39.984
He was recruiting for
his own personal Armageddon.

42:40.425 --> 42:42.222
Understandably, my daughter wanted out.

42:42.394 --> 42:43.986
When she told him she was leaving,

Milton.

01:18:15.725 --> 01:18:17.693
- Get away from her.
- I think not.

01:18:18.227 --> 01:18:21.219

All the more reason
to keep Ms. Piper in close proximity.

You might miss again.

Milton, you wouldn't be here without me,
you ungrateful shit.

So, I want you
to holster that iron God-killer,

01:18:51.427 --> 01:18:53.088
and say, "Thank you."

01:18:58.434 --> 01:19:05.067
I said, holster and "thank you."

01:19:11.814 --> 01:19:13.076
Don't hurt her.

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:16.012
Thank you.

but I have got to know,

01:19:36.439 --> 01:19:40.500
how did you get out with the God-killer?

01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:43.001
I just walked in and took it.

01:19:43.746 --> 01:19:44.974
Oh.

Wouldn't want to be you when he finds out.

What's he gonna do? Not let me back in?

01:19:52.688 --> 01:19:55.953
- Why are you helping me?
- It's 'cause of those crazy fucks.

01:20:26.188 --> 01:20:29.646
simply the warden of a very large prison.
Quiet man, actually.

01:20:29.759 --> 01:20:31.021
Thoughtful and he's well-read.

<i>I happen to know,</i>

01:20:39.602 --> 01:20:44.198
the idea of sacrificing children in his honor
annoys him greatly.

01:20:48.377 --> 01:20:51.107
- Why are you really helping me?
- We all have a job to do.

01:20:51.213 --> 01:20:54.580
Getting you here makes my job easier.
You get what you want,

01:20:54.684 --> 01:20:56.914
- I get what I want.
- Then help me now.

01:20:57.019 --> 01:20:58.384
- No.
- There are 40 of them down there,

01:20:58.454 --> 01:21:00.046
- and you and I could...
- No.

01:21:09.899 --> 01:21:12.834
You want to save her, Milton?
Then you go, and you do it.

01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:19.841
If you win, I win.

for your promise.

even stop him.

I did, but if he puts me back in that hole,
I'll still get out.
