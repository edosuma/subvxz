01:20.200 --> 01:23.368
That's it. Gently.

01:30.585 --> 01:33.291
We should head back inside, Tom.
Get you warm.

01:33.463 --> 01:36.252
There's a big storm coming.

01:48.353 --> 01:50.928
He looks kind of creepy, doesn't he ?

01:58.864 --> 02:02.032
I'll be right behind you, Tom.

02:17.800 --> 02:20.718
E minor.

02:30.980 --> 02:33.982
It's the right chord.

02:53.711 --> 02:57.840
Hello.
- Ms. Whitman,it's Doctor Jansson.

03:01.260 --> 03:03.384
I have some bad news.

03:07.141 --> 03:11.769
What's wrong with you, princess ?
Why won't you spin ?

03:13.731 --> 03:17.148
We had to bring your father in again.

03:18.361 --> 03:22.229
As we predicted,
his episodes are becoming frequent.

03:25.493 --> 03:27.985
This one looks quite serious.

03:28.246 --> 03:31.117
Yeah... I understand.

03:42.343 --> 03:46.841
Mr. Whitman
Tom.

03:47.015 --> 03:50.349
You have to come a distance, but if
we could discuss this in person...

03:50.518 --> 03:54.054
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Bye.

04:01.696 --> 04:03.986
Can you hear me, Mr. Whitman ?

04:04.950 --> 04:07.239
''Matthew knew it was hopeless.

04:07.410 --> 04:09.369
Nothing mattered anymore.

04:09.538 --> 04:13.157
Mr. White's body was melting
even as Matthew watched.

04:13.375 --> 04:18.002
The snowman could no longer speak
The happy face Matthew had loved -

04:18.171 --> 04:20.877
now was nothing but slush.

04:21.048 --> 04:23.126
Matthew stared up into the sky, -

04:23.301 --> 04:27.051
watching the winter's last snowflake
floating down.

04:27.264 --> 04:30.432
Some said its touch held
the power of magic, -

04:30.642 --> 04:34.143
but Matthew had lost his faith
in stories.

04:34.354 --> 04:38.649
But when the snowflake finally touched
Mr. White's outstretched arm, -

04:38.817 --> 04:42.020
a coating of fresh frost
spread outward from it, -

04:42.195 --> 04:45.482
and the puddle of water
under the snowman crackled -

04:45.657 --> 04:47.781
as it turned to ice.

04:47.951 --> 04:52.828
Matthew's heart filled with joy
as he watched Mr. White come alive

04:52.998 --> 04:56.534
The story of winter's last snowflake
had come true.

04:56.877 --> 05:01.457
The magical winter would never end''

05:02.841 --> 05:05.215
Time to go to bed, children.

05:05.427 --> 05:08.263
You're that new boy,Tom.

05:10.015 --> 05:13.053
You made that snowman in the backyard.

05:14.603 --> 05:17.142
I'm Ann.

05:17.648 --> 05:19.357
What's that ?

05:19.525 --> 05:21.269
She's beautiful.

05:22.236 --> 05:24.028
Can't you talk ?

05:24.196 --> 05:26.273
I can talk.

05:26.532 --> 05:29.450
Are those your parents ?

05:30.953 --> 05:34.619
That's my mom.
She got sick and

05:34.957 --> 05:37.414
She's dead now.

05:38.961 --> 05:42.212
My dad's a pilot.
- Is he dead too ?

05:42.423 --> 05:45.378
He's not dead !
My dad's Theodore Whitman.

05:45.551 --> 05:47.260
And he's a hero.

05:47.428 --> 05:50.715
He saved all his passengers
from a tornado.

05:50.931 --> 05:53.424
But he crash-landed.

05:54.518 --> 05:58.351
And when he gets rescued
he'll come and get me.

05:58.898 --> 06:02.398
Nobody here has any parents.
- Lights out !

06:03.819 --> 06:06.608
Good night, Tom.

06:14.997 --> 06:18.249
Sleep tight, princess.

07:48.383 --> 07:50.507
You'll melt for this.

07:58.101 --> 08:00.060
Well,well, well...

08:00.229 --> 08:02.637
Look who's here.

08:02.856 --> 08:05.395
It's good to see an old friend.

08:08.403 --> 08:11.524
I was just standing there
in the backyard, -

08:11.698 --> 08:16.362
minding my own business,
and I felt this sting on my arm.

08:16.537 --> 08:18.577
What ?

08:18.747 --> 08:21.453
I think it was that little thing.

08:21.667 --> 08:25.879
Tom, let's you and me take a trip.
See where it goes next.

08:26.046 --> 08:29.962
Who knows ? Maybe we'll bump
into someone you used to know.

08:30.134 --> 08:33.551
Encounter things
you've only dreamed of.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.388
I... I'm dreaming.

08:38.517 --> 08:41.009
That's why everything is so weird.

08:41.187 --> 08:44.557
So come on. It'll be fun.

08:44.732 --> 08:47.485
You'll be safe with me.

08:52.740 --> 08:57.617
Listen, buddy, if you're too scared
to come along, I understand.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.623
Maybe you're not a chip
off the old block.

09:00.790 --> 09:04.076
Don't worry about it,
you can just go back to bed.

09:04.293 --> 09:08.624
Or you can come with me
and have an adventure.

09:12.969 --> 09:15.461
It feels so real!

09:15.638 --> 09:17.762
Ice and genuine oak.

09:21.811 --> 09:24.848
Hang on, buddy.
Let's go!

09:31.904 --> 09:34.942
Now there's a sight for sore eyes

10:04.813 --> 10:07.020
What's that ?
- It's nothing, buddy.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.943
Just a rotten pile of wood and steel.

10:10.110 --> 10:13.028
Why don't we go take a look at it ?

10:15.573 --> 10:18.694
Look, it's your father.

10:27.002 --> 10:29.754
Aren't you excited to see him ?

10:29.921 --> 10:31.915
It's just a dream.

10:32.716 --> 10:36.335
This is as real as it gets for you,
buddy.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.104
Ms. Whitman ?

10:50.275 --> 10:53.147
Your father has
multi-infarct dementia.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.275
It's a condition caused by
multiple strokes.

10:56.448 --> 11:00.399
We've spoken about this
several times over the phone.

11:00.577 --> 11:03.745
Yes, we have.
But given his current condition...

11:03.914 --> 11:06.667
- You want to pull the plug.

11:08.085 --> 11:11.786
Well, it's not quite like that
He's not on life support

11:12.381 --> 11:15.299
Though his heart did stop twice

11:15.467 --> 11:19.762
We've brought him back, but to
keep doing it... -Where do I sign ?

11:28.355 --> 11:31.393
You're making the right decision.

11:31.567 --> 11:33.857
It's best to let him go.

11:35.362 --> 11:39.408
He's been living in a fantasy world
for the last couple of years.

11:39.575 --> 11:43.704
He's regressed to childhood.
I just think it would be cruel to...

11:47.208 --> 11:52.749
I can reach you at your father's
if we need to, uh, speak.

11:54.715 --> 11:58.844
I don't expect you'd be flying back
in this weather.

11:59.011 --> 12:01.420
No.

12:01.764 --> 12:05.632
Well, I'll leave you two alone.

12:38.342 --> 12:40.917
Nothing has changed, has it ?

12:44.390 --> 12:47.593
I'm not even a memory, am I ?

12:47.936 --> 12:51.602
I'm just a blur.
Like always.

12:53.650 --> 12:58.111
You know,
I waited so long for you to reach out.

12:58.279 --> 13:02.444
This was a mistake.
I've done enough for you.

13:28.059 --> 13:30.812
Oh no!
We need to turn back!

13:31.730 --> 13:34.897
It's too late! I can't!

13:40.989 --> 13:43.315
No! Help!

13:43.575 --> 13:45.450
No! Help!
- Hang on!

14:23.490 --> 14:27.110
What ?
What is this ?

14:27.494 --> 14:30.496
It's just you being you.

14:30.706 --> 14:34.076
Hi, Tom.
It's been a while.

14:34.251 --> 14:37.586
Do I know you ?
- Of course

14:37.755 --> 14:41.374
We've known each other since
we were kids. -You're crazy

14:41.550 --> 14:44.718
I was.
For a while.

14:44.887 --> 14:48.387
Come here.
Let me me patch you up.

14:50.434 --> 14:53.389
You're wondering where you are...

14:53.562 --> 14:57.312
I'm in a dream.
With a crazy woman.

14:58.067 --> 15:01.401
If I am,
it doesn't reflect well on you.

15:01.570 --> 15:04.240
In all sorts of ways.

15:04.407 --> 15:08.156
Actually,
I used to be your voice of reason.

15:08.411 --> 15:11.033
God knows you needed one.

15:11.205 --> 15:13.827
You were very good
at a lot of things.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.619
But dealing with real world
wasn't one of them.

15:19.589 --> 15:22.425
None of this makes any sense.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.257
It should.

15:26.095 --> 15:29.346
I'm just saying the things
you expect me to.

15:29.515 --> 15:32.636
Buddy!
Hey ! Where are you ?

15:32.810 --> 15:35.516
Hey! I'm here!
- Quiet.

15:35.688 --> 15:38.607
He'll find you.

15:42.779 --> 15:46.362
Oh! Leave it.
It'lljust remind you of him.

15:46.532 --> 15:49.155
You're nuts.
Leave me alone!

15:49.327 --> 15:53.622
Selfish and rude.
Yep, that's the Tom I know.

15:55.875 --> 15:59.376
The Snowman isn't the best tour guide,
you know.

15:59.545 --> 16:01.504
He's not what he seems.

16:01.673 --> 16:05.422
Don't let him steal the rest of you.

16:05.969 --> 16:08.342
I can 't see you, buddy !

16:08.513 --> 16:12.677
I'm....
- Give me a yell, loud as you can!

16:13.768 --> 16:16.889
Wretched brat, you're hiding !

16:17.063 --> 16:20.516
Not so nice now, oh,is he ?

17:01.024 --> 17:03.148
Hey, you!

17:03.318 --> 17:05.893
Be careful out here.
Those tracks are unstable.

17:06.070 --> 17:09.358
A lot of them could collapse
on us at any time.

17:09.532 --> 17:11.989
Why is this thing here ?
- Beats me.

17:12.160 --> 17:16.454
Somebody thought it was a great idea
to build it on this godforsaken place.

17:16.623 --> 17:18.332
Hey! Wait!

17:18.500 --> 17:22.665
Do you know where that music's
coming from ? I've heard it before.

17:22.838 --> 17:25.295
Kid, we've all heard it.

17:25.465 --> 17:28.550
All day, every day.
Same damn melody.

17:28.886 --> 17:31.342
Makes me sick.

17:34.183 --> 17:37.138
Aaah! Come on!

17:37.311 --> 17:40.763
Dammit!
Why do I even bother ?

17:41.190 --> 17:44.026
This thing can't be fixed!

17:47.071 --> 17:50.441
What do you want to do, Gem ?

17:50.616 --> 17:52.989
Gem !

17:54.620 --> 17:57.657
Just leave it.
It's lifeless.

17:57.831 --> 18:01.415
Yes. Thank you
Let it rot.

18:08.592 --> 18:10.669
You be careful.

18:35.077 --> 18:37.285
Song of myself...

18:46.172 --> 18:49.672
Worthless brat! I let him
out of my sight for a minute!

18:49.842 --> 18:52.880
And all this bullshit shows up!

18:53.054 --> 18:56.673
The little runt's more trouble
than he's worth.

18:56.849 --> 19:00.718
Ah, dammit!
Oh, woopsy! I missed a spot.

19:00.895 --> 19:03.683
What are you doing ?

19:04.857 --> 19:08.192
Nothing.
I was just looking for you.

19:09.320 --> 19:12.358
And now, I found you.

19:12.740 --> 19:15.944
Come here!
Let me take a look at you!

19:16.202 --> 19:18.825
What ?
What, this ?

19:19.038 --> 19:22.788
Just took a bit of a beating
in the storm, is all.

19:23.209 --> 19:25.915
Don't worry about me.

19:26.337 --> 19:29.838
Hey! What do you say
we have some fun, huh ?

19:30.091 --> 19:34.090
No! What's wrong with you ?
First, we fall, now this!

19:34.262 --> 19:37.715
This dream's stupid.
I'm leaving. -Hey! Hold up, pal.

19:37.891 --> 19:41.592
Relax.
I got something for just the two of us.

19:41.978 --> 19:45.146
Two tickets to the circus.
It'll be great, buddy.

19:45.315 --> 19:49.230
It's right around the corner.
Let me show you. -No.

19:49.402 --> 19:52.025
Leave me alone!
You're making this too weird.

19:52.197 --> 19:54.950
Don't you walk away from me!

20:02.207 --> 20:03.916
Get out of there !

20:04.084 --> 20:06.706
Come see what they've got!
- Go away!

20:06.878 --> 20:10.379
It's okay, I'm not mad.

20:59.348 --> 21:01.674
Come and share -

21:02.476 --> 21:05.846
this painting with me.

21:06.939 --> 21:08.315
No.

21:08.482 --> 21:12.066
No! What happened ?
What have you done ?

21:12.236 --> 21:17.694
Unveiling of me,
the magician that never failed.

21:21.871 --> 21:28.325
This deep sigh
coiled around my chest

21:29.086 --> 21:32.752
Hi, Tom.
I'm glad you got away.

21:33.966 --> 21:39.009
What did you do with my Arabesque ?
- You used to call it your princess.

21:39.430 --> 21:43.892
Tell me.
Could she really spin like you said ?

21:44.477 --> 21:47.598
Or is that just another stupid lie ?

21:48.022 --> 21:52.400
Sorry.
Another story.

21:55.196 --> 21:57.949
A silver platter !

21:58.116 --> 22:01.865
Did you really think fixing it
would fix things with her ?

22:02.036 --> 22:06.331
No. You didn't really want
to fix things, did you ?

22:06.499 --> 22:09.252
I don't want that!
It's broken.

22:09.419 --> 22:12.125
What are you doing ?
It's mine!

22:12.297 --> 22:15.417
I'll have what she's having.

22:18.636 --> 22:23.845
Ice-cream castles,
lips-to-ear rhymes

22:24.267 --> 22:30.852
A slumber deeper than time

22:32.859 --> 22:35.612
Who are you ?

22:35.779 --> 22:39.398
Slow, love

22:39.699 --> 22:44.279
Slow

22:45.163 --> 22:49.873
Only the weak -

22:51.920 --> 22:56.298
are not lonely

23:59.488 --> 24:01.861
Slow

24:03.742 --> 24:06.994
Slow, slow

24:28.476 --> 24:33.186
Slow, love

24:34.398 --> 24:37.186
Slow

24:39.946 --> 24:44.525
Slow, slow

25:01.092 --> 25:04.378
You used to play so beautifully, Tom.

25:04.971 --> 25:09.183
You had a song for every
little thing in your life.

25:09.475 --> 25:11.718
It's a shame it had to end.

25:12.020 --> 25:14.428
I understand.

25:14.605 --> 25:17.976
Would you quit calling me Tom ?
You don't even know me!

25:18.151 --> 25:21.069
It's you who no longer
knows people, Tom.

25:21.237 --> 25:25.022
And it's your own fault.
For feeding him.

25:33.333 --> 25:36.418
Don't let him take all of you!

25:46.888 --> 25:49.131
Wait!

25:58.608 --> 26:02.903
These doors of yours aren't going
to keep your secrets safe from me.

26:11.913 --> 26:15.414
Dad.
I had a bad dream.

26:19.671 --> 26:23.337
What are you doing ?
- Nothing.

26:23.759 --> 26:26.926
I'm doing nothing at all.

26:28.096 --> 26:30.968
It's bedtime.
Go back to sleep.

26:31.141 --> 26:34.558
But Dad...
- Is this about your mother again ?

26:46.740 --> 26:49.908
The circus...

26:50.077 --> 26:53.363
It's not until tomorrow.

26:53.539 --> 26:56.541
Just go to bed.

27:02.715 --> 27:04.673
Dad...

27:06.260 --> 27:08.799
What ?

27:09.346 --> 27:11.921
Are you scared ?

27:12.099 --> 27:16.145
How can you be scared of it
if you've never even seen it ?

27:16.312 --> 27:19.017
Huh ?

27:21.108 --> 27:24.644
Look.
It's just a bunch of clowns.

27:27.448 --> 27:32.325
And trapeze artists
...wearing tights...

27:34.288 --> 27:36.365
That's all.

27:36.707 --> 27:39.793
Alright Buddy.

27:41.712 --> 27:44.631
Back to bed now.

27:47.176 --> 27:50.795
Thomas...
- Yes, sir.

27:57.353 --> 28:00.438
Nothing.

28:00.606 --> 28:04.652
Bed.Now.

28:23.046 --> 28:25.004
No!

28:25.340 --> 28:26.918
No!

28:27.258 --> 28:32.087
... the snow storm is still escalating,
and the temperature is falling fast.

28:32.263 --> 28:36.262
Our friends in the weather department
are forecasting record-breaking cold, -

28:36.434 --> 28:40.350
so it's a good idea to stay indoors,
especially for the elderly.

28:40.522 --> 28:44.188
The authorities are warning of
possible blackouts, so take extra care.

28:44.359 --> 28:47.277
Maybe get yourself
some batteries and candles -

28:47.445 --> 28:50.198
and keep an eye on for your elders.

28:53.535 --> 28:56.702
Hello.

29:01.501 --> 29:04.871
Well, well,look at you!

29:06.006 --> 29:09.506
You're beautiful!
- Ann...

29:09.676 --> 29:13.093
Of course.
How did you get in here ?

29:13.430 --> 29:16.882
It's a magic trick.
I can't reveal the secret, -

29:17.058 --> 29:20.511
but it involved a brick.

29:20.687 --> 29:23.179
Well, it's nice to see you.

29:23.356 --> 29:27.569
What happened to
"you destroyed my life, you old bitch" ?

29:27.736 --> 29:31.651
Nobody destroyed my life.
You people just did what you wanted.

29:31.823 --> 29:35.905
Everyone for themselves, right ?
- That's unfair.

29:37.120 --> 29:40.870
It wasn't like that.
- Really ? What was it like ?

29:41.041 --> 29:44.209
Because the band, and the tours,
and the money -

29:44.378 --> 29:46.206
and all that stupid crap...

29:46.380 --> 29:48.919
That seemed more important
to my dad -

29:49.091 --> 29:52.009
than anything that had to do
with me or my mom.

29:52.177 --> 29:55.096
And even when he was home,
he was never here.

29:55.264 --> 29:58.301
He was always lost
inside his own mind.

30:00.310 --> 30:02.684
Anyway I don't care.

30:02.855 --> 30:06.225
You may have unresolved issues
with Tom. I don't.

30:06.400 --> 30:09.734
Oooh, yeah.
I can see that.

30:10.487 --> 30:14.533
Well, it's not like I've ever
been a part of his life, so...

30:14.700 --> 30:18.651
You were always the most
important part of his life.

30:22.291 --> 30:25.743
There. That's better.

30:29.340 --> 30:33.385
I don't know why he had to
put the bad ones up too.

30:34.386 --> 30:37.839
He just could never let go.

30:44.397 --> 30:46.474
How cute!

30:47.149 --> 30:50.602
You used to be a happy kid.

30:50.778 --> 30:54.314
I used to be.
All thanks to him.

30:56.409 --> 31:00.787
All he ever wanted was...
was to forget everything.

31:01.289 --> 31:04.659
And move on with you.

31:04.834 --> 31:08.037
Of course, it didn't work out.

31:10.089 --> 31:13.625
You know, Ann,
it was a long time ago...

31:14.469 --> 31:16.877
You really should just let it go.

31:17.054 --> 31:21.184
When you get old enough,
you don't fear death anymore.

31:21.350 --> 31:24.803
You wait for it.
And after a while, you hope for it -

31:24.979 --> 31:28.182
even if you don't admit it.
Do you know why ?

31:28.358 --> 31:33.601
Because losing your mind before
you go is worse than dying.

31:34.864 --> 31:39.907
You hope you'll check out before
your brain turns to some mush.

31:41.621 --> 31:44.576
Yeah, well,
you still seem pretty sharp.

31:44.749 --> 31:47.870
I'm talking about your father.

31:49.212 --> 31:52.748
He's in a dark place right now.

31:53.675 --> 31:58.089
Doesn't it bother you
not knowing how he remembers you ?

31:58.263 --> 32:00.755
No.
I think it bothers you more.

32:00.932 --> 32:04.468
If he remembers me at all,
it's as something that was broken -

32:04.644 --> 32:06.970
and then put back together.

32:07.147 --> 32:10.065
And he was never
really good at fixing things.

32:10.233 --> 32:13.188
He did the best he could.

32:14.446 --> 32:16.523
I'm tired.

32:22.662 --> 32:26.079
You oughta be
more careful, buddy.

32:26.249 --> 32:30.034
Or else you're going to turn this
into a nightmare -No!

32:30.212 --> 32:33.546
You're hurting me!
- You know I would never do that!

32:33.715 --> 32:37.168
I want what's best for you.

33:15.507 --> 33:18.759
Oh, now this is the real deal.

33:19.303 --> 33:22.305
Hey buddy!
What are you doing over there ?

33:22.473 --> 33:24.881
Come here. They're starting.

33:31.023 --> 33:34.856
Sorry! Now I get it.
You're part of the act.

33:35.027 --> 33:37.863
Oh, I gotta see this.

33:46.747 --> 33:50.331
Once upon a time -

33:50.501 --> 33:52.578
in a daymare

33:52.753 --> 33:55.874
Dying to meet you, little child

33:56.132 --> 33:58.125
Enter, enter this sideshow

33:58.342 --> 34:04.049
Time for bed the cradle still rocks

34:04.223 --> 34:07.426
13 chimes on a dead man's clock

34:07.602 --> 34:10.010
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock

34:14.192 --> 34:16.268
Daddy!

34:21.324 --> 34:27.031
The bride will lure you,
cook you, eat you

34:27.205 --> 34:32.911
Your dear innocence boiled to
feed the evil in need of fear

34:33.168 --> 34:38.507
Burning farms and squealing pigs

34:38.841 --> 34:43.136
A pool of snakes to swim with,
oh sweet poison

34:43.304 --> 34:46.176
Bite me, bite me

35:07.954 --> 35:11.040
Ladies and gentlemen!

35:11.666 --> 35:15.036
Be heartlessly welcome -

35:15.545 --> 35:20.173
to Cirque De Morgue!

35:21.134 --> 35:26.046
And what a show we have
for you tonight!

35:29.267 --> 35:31.640
Madam.

35:33.146 --> 35:36.065
Mr Thomas Whitman!

35:39.194 --> 35:42.611
A composer and a poet!

35:47.494 --> 35:50.366
A bad, bad father.

35:50.622 --> 35:53.624
With a bad, bad memory!

36:08.473 --> 36:10.681
No, please, stop!

36:12.895 --> 36:15.138
No!

36:16.064 --> 36:18.142
No!

36:30.871 --> 36:34.407
Restless souls
will put on their dancing shoes

36:34.583 --> 36:38.119
Mindless ghouls
with lot of limbs to lose.

36:38.379 --> 36:43.622
Illusionists, contortionist,
Tightrope-walkers tightening the noose

36:45.135 --> 36:47.972
Oh, look!
This one's about your wife.

36:49.974 --> 36:53.225
Just about nothing left of her, I see.

36:58.649 --> 37:01.900
Hardly.
Worth the effort.

37:23.299 --> 37:27.843
Memories. It's not like
you have any real use for them.

37:34.519 --> 37:39.810
We all lose parts of ourselves
bit by bit -

37:39.982 --> 37:42.652
by bit

38:02.714 --> 38:04.921
What ?

38:05.633 --> 38:09.217
What the hell ?
That's not how it turns out !

38:26.196 --> 38:29.317
Stop! That's all wrong!
Don't change it!

38:35.330 --> 38:37.787
You're wrecking it!

38:50.929 --> 38:54.844
Thomas.
- Yes, sir. -Nothing.

43:22.286 --> 43:24.992
Goddammit !

43:41.430 --> 43:45.512
How many digits
do these things usually have ?

43:45.810 --> 43:47.969
I don't know.

43:48.146 --> 43:51.646
Just don't try to break it.
It won't work.

43:52.066 --> 43:56.147
We need to get this stupid thing open.

43:57.030 --> 43:59.356
Why, Ann ?

43:59.532 --> 44:03.578
Cause when Tom locks
something away, it's important.

44:04.120 --> 44:07.870
Well, he didn't have any money.
You guys pissed all of it away.

44:08.041 --> 44:11.078
A little bitter, are we ?

44:11.252 --> 44:15.714
About having to pay for his care,
actually, yes, I am.

44:17.300 --> 44:19.543
You did a good thing.

44:19.719 --> 44:24.347
You let him stay here, at home,
with his memories.

44:24.516 --> 44:27.683
Not so bad for somebody
who doesn't care about her father.

44:27.852 --> 44:30.344
What were my options ?

44:30.563 --> 44:34.776
It was either that or have every
goddamn family friend drown me in guilt.

44:34.943 --> 44:37.150
Nonsense.

44:37.320 --> 44:41.236
This family has been out of friends
for at least a decade, sweetheart.

44:41.408 --> 44:46.236
I wonder why. What with Tom being
so famous for caring about people...

44:47.956 --> 44:50.530
I keep telling you.

44:50.709 --> 44:53.664
He cared.

45:08.393 --> 45:11.894
Another magic trick!

45:12.064 --> 45:15.765
He picks something that he knew
he would never forget.

45:15.942 --> 45:18.351
What a cliche!

45:21.782 --> 45:24.155
What's in there ?

45:39.383 --> 45:43.216
"but all I am
is smoke and mirrors"

45:49.768 --> 45:52.557
It's about him.

45:52.730 --> 45:54.889
There's a shock!

46:15.377 --> 46:18.379
"Miracles come in small packages"

46:18.547 --> 46:23.709
"It takes so little to turn a child into
the most fortunate being in the world"

47:32.539 --> 47:34.532
No! Stop!

47:40.004 --> 47:41.963
Leave me alone!
I hate you!

47:42.132 --> 47:44.540
Wait!
Who are you ?

48:17.209 --> 48:19.286
Wait!

49:03.964 --> 49:07.833
So. Satisfied now, are we ?

49:08.010 --> 49:12.091
Yes. Because this...
this is what I grew up with.

49:12.598 --> 49:15.766
Scattered pages,
songs, words of wisdom.

49:15.935 --> 49:19.102
Fairy tales all around me.

49:19.271 --> 49:22.938
You see that thing ?
His precious arabesque ?

49:23.109 --> 49:27.107
His princess. He said the dancer
inside would spin -

49:27.279 --> 49:30.649
if I managed to play the chords right
when I was learning the piano.

49:30.825 --> 49:32.617
Look, Gem...
- No!

49:32.785 --> 49:36.237
His idea of raising me was to feed
me these endless pipe dreams -

49:36.414 --> 49:38.324
and weird monologues.

49:38.499 --> 49:40.576
Because everything
was a performance to him.

49:40.751 --> 49:43.872
And he did the same thing
to my mom. Strung her along.

49:44.046 --> 49:47.879
Kept making and breaking promises.
And she always believed him!

49:48.050 --> 49:50.969
Always!
And he always disappointed her!

49:51.137 --> 49:53.806
Because you, you came first!

49:53.973 --> 49:58.138
And then, she ended up dead
because of you.

50:01.022 --> 50:03.893
I hope it was worth it.

50:06.360 --> 50:08.983
Ouch! Shit!

50:11.199 --> 50:14.236
Bonjour, mon general!

50:14.744 --> 50:20.368
This. This is how small I was
in his magical, musical world.

50:20.917 --> 50:25.081
D'you know he'd written songs
for everyone around him ?

50:25.630 --> 50:27.956
Maybe even for this little bastard here.

50:28.132 --> 50:32.677
But never...
never for my mom or me.

51:04.211 --> 51:08.708
Un, deux, trois, quatre!

51:10.258 --> 51:14.304
Bonjour, mon general!
You were fortunate to find your way.

51:14.930 --> 51:18.216
What's happening ?
Where am I ?

51:18.391 --> 51:21.014
Why the battlefield, Sir.

51:21.186 --> 51:24.556
You've fought in this room
for many years. Ha!

51:24.731 --> 51:28.730
I'm ashamed that I wounded you
so grievously. And for nothing.

51:28.902 --> 51:32.771
I don't know what you mean.
- Please, Sir, don't spare my feelings.

51:32.948 --> 51:37.777
It was a mighty blow I struck.
I can only beg for your forgiveness.

51:38.787 --> 51:43.117
I stepped on you.
- Tut-tut! I ambushed you.

51:43.292 --> 51:46.163
But, Sir, my motives were pure.

51:46.336 --> 51:51.379
It was a brave attempt to stop you
from going with the accursed snowman.

51:51.550 --> 51:53.959
That evil pig!

51:55.512 --> 51:58.763
It's the memories, Sir.

51:58.932 --> 52:03.726
He takes them!
Takes you further in the darkness.

52:06.273 --> 52:10.142
But why ?
- You got old!

52:10.444 --> 52:15.237
Still, you've got the best of him...
at least for now.

52:15.574 --> 52:18.362
The best memories hurt him.

52:18.536 --> 52:21.906
You've chased the very best one.

52:23.123 --> 52:27.371
That girl...
- Yes! Your daughter!

52:28.712 --> 52:33.257
What a girl! What a memory!
Ah, c'est magnifique!

52:33.426 --> 52:37.720
You remember best through the things
you both shared as children.

52:37.888 --> 52:42.302
Like myself or
the pretty mademoiselle -

52:42.476 --> 52:44.885
within the glass bubble.

52:45.062 --> 52:48.895
Hm, yes You loved us well
and so did your daughter.

52:49.900 --> 52:52.856
I don't remember her
- Ah, well...

52:53.029 --> 52:56.897
There's nothing to be done then
C'est la vie!

52:57.074 --> 52:59.649
This is as far as we go.

53:01.204 --> 53:03.778
No. -Sir

53:08.002 --> 53:10.079
I need your help.

53:10.296 --> 53:14.129
I need to remember her.

53:14.926 --> 53:17.465
I need to find her!

53:18.554 --> 53:21.556
Comrades!

53:26.938 --> 53:30.687
En avant! Marche!

53:40.910 --> 53:44.161
You still have memories
that were precious to you.

53:44.330 --> 53:48.199
You hid them. We know where
It's not too far.

53:48.376 --> 53:51.414
I don't think I have many left.
- Oh, no.

53:51.588 --> 53:54.162
I don't even know
who am I anymore.

53:54.340 --> 53:56.334
We all take wounds, Sir.

53:56.509 --> 53:59.132
I'm sorry about that.
- Don't be, Sir.

53:59.304 --> 54:02.140
I'm a mere soldier.
Just a casualty of war.

54:02.390 --> 54:06.341
You could have disposed of us
Instead, you handed us on, -

54:06.519 --> 54:09.771
and you told your daughter
how important we were.

54:09.940 --> 54:13.060
Hourra! Hourra!

54:34.214 --> 54:37.584
We have to hurry, Sir.

54:38.760 --> 54:41.383
The night your mother
had the accident...

54:41.555 --> 54:45.388
If Tom had gotten home earlier,
things might have been different.

54:45.559 --> 54:48.727
He was with you, Ann!
- It's not what you think.

54:50.063 --> 54:54.014
Back then,
my life was out of control.

54:54.193 --> 54:57.360
Things were crazy,
with the band, with everything.

54:57.529 --> 55:00.317
It got too much for me.

55:00.824 --> 55:04.408
I took some pills. But I didn't
take enough, because I woke up.

55:04.578 --> 55:09.621
And then, when I did, Tom was there.
I didn't plan it that way.

55:10.209 --> 55:13.994
I don't want to hear this.
- He stayed with me.

55:14.838 --> 55:18.588
But he would not look at me,
not after what I had done.

55:18.759 --> 55:22.924
I bet that little stunt really screwed
with your precious band.

55:23.097 --> 55:26.514
No, no.
Yeah, it was the end of the band.

55:26.809 --> 55:31.555
True, but no, you see,
what I'd done was.

55:32.064 --> 55:36.526
Ah, I don't know,
too personal for him.

55:39.613 --> 55:42.948
You don't know.
- Know what ?

55:43.117 --> 55:45.609
Oh, Gem, honey.

55:45.786 --> 55:50.449
You don't know that
Tom's father killed himself ?

55:50.624 --> 55:54.754
Yeah Theodore Whitman shot
himself in the head.

55:54.962 --> 55:58.712
And Tom watched it happen.

56:00.051 --> 56:04.215
What I did was hard on him.

56:04.805 --> 56:09.219
And that night,
your mother had the accident.

56:11.020 --> 56:14.141
That's what broke up the band.

56:14.357 --> 56:19.316
He didn't care but he knew
he was going to lose you as well.

56:21.989 --> 56:24.113
Why are you telling me this ?

56:24.283 --> 56:27.784
Because I don't think
you know your father at all.

56:27.954 --> 56:32.000
He worshipped Theodore
in spite of his dark moods.

56:33.042 --> 56:36.958
From what Tom told me,
he could be really mean.

56:37.547 --> 56:42.755
So, when Tom felt himself
going down the same path, -

56:43.720 --> 56:46.342
he pushed you away.

56:48.808 --> 56:52.759
I know.
He pushed very hard.

57:32.227 --> 57:35.811
We have arrived, Sir.

57:54.291 --> 57:57.079
I remember...

58:04.384 --> 58:08.632
Yes, I locked them away!
They're here!

58:09.598 --> 58:14.594
May I say, Sir, it has been
a pleasure to serve you and yours.

58:45.134 --> 58:47.756
"Miracles come in small packages.

58:47.928 --> 58:52.841
It takes so little to turn a child into
the most fortunate being in the world"

58:53.267 --> 58:57.480
"It wasn't much of a circus.
It was cheap, shabby and rundown.

58:58.272 --> 59:01.523
And she was enchanted
by everything she saw, -

59:01.692 --> 59:03.935
laughing and squeezing my hand.

59:04.111 --> 59:08.324
The first time I felt like a father,
watching her smile"

59:11.953 --> 59:14.789
Why couldn't he just told me this ?

59:14.956 --> 59:19.085
He did tell you, in his way,
the only way he knew.

59:19.418 --> 59:24.876
Oh man, I was always hoping
there might be something -

59:25.049 --> 59:28.384
that would make it all worthwhile.

59:28.553 --> 59:32.089
Not this nonsense.
- Oh my God!

59:32.682 --> 59:36.728
These aren't just scattered
thoughts or feelings. Look!

59:41.608 --> 59:45.476
Mon dieu! A l'attaque!

01:00:02.003 --> 01:00:05.456
Some of this is complete,
but the rest...

01:00:06.424 --> 01:00:09.841
His words stop or just trail off.

01:00:11.096 --> 01:00:14.216
Gaps, spaces...

01:00:27.946 --> 01:00:32.775
"She's a true reflection of her mother,
my broken missing love.

01:00:33.702 --> 01:00:37.535
So small but as wise
and as beautiful as she was.

01:00:40.167 --> 01:00:43.786
I am proud with love.

01:00:43.962 --> 01:00:46.668
Now I push her away"

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:50.376
"She must not share my darkness.

01:00:50.552 --> 01:00:54.681
I hope she'll understand one day"

01:00:55.807 --> 01:01:00.269
So this is where you stashed
all the good stuff, huh ?

01:01:01.855 --> 01:01:06.435
What ? This ? I just took
a bit of a beating, is all.

01:01:06.944 --> 01:01:09.613
You should see your little friends.

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:12.354
I know what you've been up to.
Congratulations.

01:01:12.533 --> 01:01:14.194
What did we learn, huh ?

01:01:14.368 --> 01:01:17.121
Your daddy had his fill of you,
took his own life.

01:01:17.287 --> 01:01:19.115
The songbird tried the same trick.

01:01:19.289 --> 01:01:21.283
Then there's your little girl...
She hates you.

01:01:21.458 --> 01:01:23.251
Nothing left if you ask me...

01:01:23.419 --> 01:01:25.745
It seems like
you don't have much left either.

01:01:25.921 --> 01:01:27.714
I've got one thing:

01:01:28.257 --> 01:01:30.049
Magic.

01:01:30.217 --> 01:01:34.430
Light brings darkness.
What sweet irony.

01:01:36.473 --> 01:01:39.808
It's your world, your rules.

01:01:40.603 --> 01:01:44.388
Now I wonder who dreamed that up.

01:01:48.027 --> 01:01:50.234
And here it comes.

01:01:50.404 --> 01:01:54.070
It's like watching
your greatest fear come alive.

01:02:29.485 --> 01:02:35.240
A crow flew to me,
kept its distance

01:02:35.575 --> 01:02:39.989
Such a proud creation

01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:45.243
I saw its soul,
envied its pride

01:02:45.418 --> 01:02:49.666
But needed nothing it had.

01:02:49.839 --> 01:02:55.464
An owl came to me, old and wise

01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:59.305
Pierced right through my youth

01:03:00.683 --> 01:03:05.560
I learned its ways,
envied its sense

01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:10.108
But needed nothing it had.

01:03:10.276 --> 01:03:15.568
A dove came to me,
had no fear

01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:20.035
It rested on my arm

01:03:20.829 --> 01:03:25.705
I touched its calm,
envied its love

01:03:25.917 --> 01:03:30.960
But needed nothing it had.

01:03:31.715 --> 01:03:36.591
A swan of white,
she came to me

01:03:36.761 --> 01:03:41.804
The lake mirrored
her beauty sweet

01:03:41.975 --> 01:03:46.768
I kissed her neck,
adored her grace

01:03:46.938 --> 01:03:52.230
But needed nothing she could give.

01:03:54.738 --> 01:03:57.526
Ann. Ann!

01:03:58.909 --> 01:04:01.282
Look !

01:04:09.628 --> 01:04:12.630
That's your dad for you.

01:04:14.174 --> 01:04:18.007
Yeah, but just look at it.
I mean, he did all this by hand.

01:04:18.178 --> 01:04:21.381
There are spaces,
things he didn't finish.

01:04:21.932 --> 01:04:25.135
He started writing things down -

01:04:25.310 --> 01:04:29.226
when he realized
that he was losing his mind.

01:04:31.191 --> 01:04:34.312
So where is the last page ?

01:04:42.578 --> 01:04:45.117
What was it ?

01:04:52.588 --> 01:04:56.456
All these fragments, memories...

01:04:56.926 --> 01:04:58.800
It's his life.

01:04:58.969 --> 01:05:02.885
Oh great.
- Hold on, I'll check if it's a fuse.

01:05:14.443 --> 01:05:18.359
Yep, it's the power:
Of course, the phone's dead.

01:05:26.038 --> 01:05:28.744
I'm going over there.

01:05:32.128 --> 01:05:35.414
Oh! Goddammit.
I can't call a cab.

01:05:35.590 --> 01:05:39.125
Hey, I got a car.
- Really ? Let's go.

01:05:54.817 --> 01:05:57.356
Sorry, old man.

01:05:57.528 --> 01:06:00.981
Your daughter's
not picking up her phone.

01:06:01.157 --> 01:06:03.317
Must be the storm.

01:06:15.463 --> 01:06:19.379
No!
Not yet! I'm not finished!

01:06:55.796 --> 01:06:58.881
It's nearly over now!

01:07:02.886 --> 01:07:05.923
What are you gonna do,
outmaneuver me ?

01:07:06.098 --> 01:07:08.257
You're on a track, you idiot!

01:07:08.433 --> 01:07:12.479
I know what's down there,
and you're not going to like it!

01:07:47.222 --> 01:07:49.631
I won't let you do this!

01:07:55.689 --> 01:07:58.775
You won't get that lucky again!

01:08:33.728 --> 01:08:36.350
E minor!

01:08:36.522 --> 01:08:40.058
I was right
She did spin!

01:09:55.602 --> 01:09:59.268
You hurry right in, I'll park the car.

01:10:00.190 --> 01:10:03.560
Go! I'll be right with you!

01:10:27.259 --> 01:10:31.340
I've got you now.
I'm all the future you'll ever have.

01:10:31.513 --> 01:10:33.222
Buddy!

01:10:33.390 --> 01:10:36.725
No!
You won't take my life from me again!

01:10:36.894 --> 01:10:40.560
But I am gonna make
what's left of it a living hell

01:10:40.731 --> 01:10:43.104
But why ?
- Like you don't know.

01:10:43.275 --> 01:10:47.819
All your music, all your hopes,
they're just ruins and blank canvas now.

01:10:47.988 --> 01:10:51.358
I'm all that you can bring to mind
You tell me why!

01:10:51.533 --> 01:10:55.117
I can't help it!
- You always knew I was poison!

01:10:55.287 --> 01:10:58.206
You could have chosen her
if you'd cut me down to size.

01:10:58.374 --> 01:11:01.993
But you built me stronger every year!
- I had to!

01:11:02.169 --> 01:11:05.255
I never wanted to lose
the memory of you!

01:11:05.422 --> 01:11:08.839
I've wiped you clean of useless
dreams and memories, -

01:11:09.009 --> 01:11:11.548
you weak little brat.
- Dad, please!

01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:15.766
I'll drag you down with me!
You always knew I would:!

01:11:15.933 --> 01:11:18.935
Dad! Stop!

01:11:28.612 --> 01:11:31.698
I have to let you go.

01:11:52.136 --> 01:11:54.213
Daddy.

01:11:54.889 --> 01:11:56.847
Daddy.

01:12:41.227 --> 01:12:44.182
Thanks for the ride.

01:13:49.713 --> 01:13:53.083
Sleep tight, Princess.

01:14:29.336 --> 01:14:31.829
I'm here.

01:14:34.925 --> 01:14:37.418
I'm so sorry.

01:14:44.018 --> 01:14:46.890
Daddy.

01:14:55.696 --> 01:14:58.615
Is this what you want ?

01:15:08.793 --> 01:15:11.202
What ?

01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:31.982
Princess.

01:16:57.986 --> 01:17:01.771
I'll hope to hear the chords
played again one day.

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:09.289
Without them I'm lost
in this nothingness.

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:16.210
Wandering after far off music
through a desert of ashes.

01:17:19.842 --> 01:17:24.469
If a tune had a colour it would be
a mixture of pink and red

01:17:27.266 --> 01:17:30.683
Constantly afraid of it fading away

01:17:30.853 --> 01:17:34.982
Terrified of the silence that may come.

01:17:44.992 --> 01:17:50.035
My final memories are pulling me
towards the end of a black alley

01:17:51.499 --> 01:17:54.833
There 's a door in the darkness...

01:17:58.506 --> 01:18:02.754
I struggle to find my way
through the door.

01:18:16.274 --> 01:18:19.027
I can hear it clearly now.

01:18:19.193 --> 01:18:23.109
The most beautiful melody
ever created by man.

01:18:30.663 --> 01:18:33.535
I enter the room...

01:18:38.421 --> 01:18:42.123
And there forever remains -

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:46.714
that change from G to E minor.

01:18:47.305 --> 01:18:53.586
