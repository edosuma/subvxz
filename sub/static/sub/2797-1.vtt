00:55.083 --> 00:56.750
(man) <i>Welcome, freshmen.</i>

00:56.834 --> 00:59.625
I'm sure you're bummed
to be back in school.

00:59.709 --> 01:01.041
Well, so am I!

01:01.125 --> 01:04.542
Five hundred words.
What you did on your summer vacation.

01:05.083 --> 01:07.417
(Randy) <i>Name: Randy Cunningham.</i>

01:07.500 --> 01:09.792
<i>Grade: Nine.</i>

01:09.875 --> 01:11.834
<i>Title: What I did on my summer...</i>

01:11.917 --> 01:13.041
Cunningham.
Let me copy off ya'.

01:13.125 --> 01:15.458
Howard, we can't turn in
the exact same essay.

01:15.542 --> 01:16.625
We had the exact same summer.

01:16.709 --> 01:17.750
-(glass shattering)
-(groans)

01:17.834 --> 01:18.667
No talking!

01:18.750 --> 01:21.250
(Randy) <i>Well, it wasn't the exact same.</i>

01:21.333 --> 01:24.166
<i>I mean, it started out the same.</i>

01:36.291 --> 01:38.583
<i>But then a week ago,</i>
<i>something epic happened.</i>

01:38.667 --> 01:41.625
(game) <i>Congratulations.</i>
<i>You have punched all the graves.</i>

01:43.333 --> 01:44.458
(Randy) <i>And the day after that,</i>

01:44.542 --> 01:47.625
<i>something even epic-er happened.</i>

01:52.500 --> 01:55.125
The Ninja-nomicon.

01:55.208 --> 01:56.250
Eh.

01:58.625 --> 01:59.709
"You are the Ninja."

01:59.792 --> 02:02.125
Oh, my... sweet!

02:02.208 --> 02:03.834
I have to tell Howard.

02:03.917 --> 02:05.667
"You can't tell anyone."

02:05.750 --> 02:07.208
Ah, that's wonk!

02:13.834 --> 02:15.375
<i>Listen, I don't know how it works,</i>

02:15.458 --> 02:18.291
<i>but the Ninja suit</i>
<i>is the straight-up cheese.</i>

02:19.542 --> 02:22.291
<i>It lets me do things</i>
<i>I could never, ever do.</i>

02:23.375 --> 02:25.250
(grunting)

02:26.417 --> 02:29.417
(exclaiming)

02:29.500 --> 02:30.875
(laughs)

02:30.959 --> 02:32.375
<i>I am Randy Cunningham.</i>

02:32.458 --> 02:33.875
(grunting)

02:33.959 --> 02:35.417
<i>I am the Ninja.</i>

02:35.500 --> 02:37.333
<i>It's pretty much the coolest thing ever.</i>

02:37.417 --> 02:39.750
<i>Only bummer is I can't tell anyone.</i>

02:40.500 --> 02:42.625
<i>Not even my best friend.</i>

02:42.709 --> 02:43.917
(teacher) Pencils down!

02:46.083 --> 02:48.750
<i>And now I'm realizing</i>
<i>this probably wasn't</i>

02:48.834 --> 02:50.291
<i>the best topic for my essay.</i>

02:53.834 --> 02:55.333
What's this supposed to be?

02:55.417 --> 02:57.458
Uh, my commentary
on the fleeting nature of summer?

02:57.542 --> 02:59.709
Ooh, excellent use of metaphor.

02:59.792 --> 03:01.458
-Aced it!
-I'll give you a B.

03:01.542 --> 03:02.792
B'ced it!

03:02.875 --> 03:05.709
Go away, Bash!
I don't want a wedgie.

03:05.792 --> 03:07.375
I already gave you a wedgie.

03:07.458 --> 03:09.583
I just wanna give you your change!

03:09.667 --> 03:11.625
Can we talk about this ninja situation?

03:11.709 --> 03:13.333
Ninja situation?

03:13.417 --> 03:15.000
There is no ninja situation.

03:15.083 --> 03:17.458
Exactly, the no ninja situation.

03:17.542 --> 03:19.375
We've been in Norrisville High
for two days,

03:19.458 --> 03:20.917
and we haven't seen this guy once.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.709
I think he has to wait for like a monster
or a robot to attack.

03:24.792 --> 03:26.000
Why aren't you madder about this?

03:26.083 --> 03:27.834
-Come on!
-We are his number one fans.

03:27.917 --> 03:29.834
I mean, it's not like
he can just smoke bomb on by

03:29.917 --> 03:31.291
for a meet and greet.

03:31.375 --> 03:33.583
Or can he?

03:33.667 --> 03:38.417
You assured me you would
destroy the Ninja.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.333
But I haven't seen him all summer.

03:40.417 --> 03:42.208
Have you seen him, Viceroy?

03:42.291 --> 03:43.500
I haven't seen him.

03:43.583 --> 03:45.291
Then again, he is a ninja,

03:45.375 --> 03:48.208
so stealth is kinda his dealio.

03:48.291 --> 03:49.333
We have a plan.

03:49.417 --> 03:51.417
The second he pokes
his little ninja head

03:51.500 --> 03:53.417
out of his little ninja hidey-hole...

03:53.500 --> 03:55.166
Bam! Destroyed!

03:55.792 --> 03:57.583
(roaring)

03:57.667 --> 04:03.291
Do... not... fail... me.

04:05.375 --> 04:07.458
-(phone ringing)
-(both screaming)

04:08.417 --> 04:10.792
(woman) <i>Mr. McFist,</i>
<i>your wife is on the line.</i>

04:10.875 --> 04:12.792
(grumbling)

04:12.875 --> 04:15.041
(inhaling, exhaling)

04:15.125 --> 04:16.875
Hey, sugarface!

04:16.959 --> 04:18.875
I'm a teensy bit busy here.

04:18.959 --> 04:22.250
Of course.
I'll meet you there, honeycakes.

04:22.333 --> 04:24.959
(shouting)

04:26.625 --> 04:29.125
How am I supposed
to run an evil empire

04:29.208 --> 04:32.709
when my stepson
keeps getting in trouble at school?

04:32.792 --> 04:33.667
Kids.

04:33.750 --> 04:35.667
Just get down to your lab

04:35.750 --> 04:37.875
and build me something deadly.

04:37.959 --> 04:40.458
Something dangerous.
Something with a cupholder!

04:42.417 --> 04:44.083
You know what?
Forget the cupholder.

04:44.166 --> 04:46.166
Just make it deadly.

04:46.250 --> 04:48.041
Mm-hmm.

04:48.125 --> 04:49.834
(bell ringing)

04:49.917 --> 04:51.875
(humming)

04:52.000 --> 04:54.500
Hmm. Hmm!

04:54.583 --> 04:56.583
Cunningham, I know you're in the can,

04:56.667 --> 04:59.917
but if you don't want me
to eat your tater lumps, just say so.

05:00.000 --> 05:00.917
(Randy) Smoke bomb!

05:01.000 --> 05:02.458
(all gasping)

05:02.542 --> 05:05.875
Hello, students. 'Tis I, the Ninja!

05:05.959 --> 05:08.750
-(all exclaiming)
-Finally! Yes!

05:08.834 --> 05:13.041
Ninja! Hey, Cunningham,
the Ninja just showed up.

05:13.125 --> 05:15.625
In these two days of school alone,

05:15.709 --> 05:19.166
Bash has given 66 wedgies, 32 swirlies,

05:19.250 --> 05:21.375
and a Chattanooga Gravy Bowl.

05:21.458 --> 05:22.834
Is that even a real thing?

05:23.667 --> 05:25.166
-(both shouting)
-Sweet potatoes?

05:25.250 --> 05:26.375
Oh, yeah!

05:26.458 --> 05:27.792
Oh, Principal Slimovitz,

05:27.875 --> 05:31.875
I just don't believe my little Bashford
would ever do anything like that.

05:31.959 --> 05:34.667
Yeah, Ma, he's framing me!
(exclaims)

05:34.750 --> 05:36.834
Hey! The Ninja's in the cafeteria!

05:36.917 --> 05:37.875
(all chattering)

05:37.959 --> 05:39.583
Ooh, the Ninja!

05:39.667 --> 05:41.542
What say we take a fiver?

05:41.625 --> 05:42.750
I'm escaping!

05:42.834 --> 05:43.917
Oh, go on.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.458
If you don't destroy the Ninja now,

05:45.542 --> 05:47.500
it's all you'll talk about
on the ride home.

05:47.583 --> 05:50.709
You know what?
You're the best! Mwha!

05:50.792 --> 05:52.083
-(phone ringing)
-(Viceroy sighing)

05:52.166 --> 05:56.083
McFist Industries,
Evil Genius Viceroy speaking.

05:56.166 --> 05:58.291
The Ninja's at the school right now.

05:58.375 --> 05:59.917
Release the... (squeaking)

06:00.000 --> 06:01.125
...the thing!

06:01.208 --> 06:02.750
His name is Krakenstein.

06:02.834 --> 06:04.834
Release the Krakenstein!

06:11.458 --> 06:13.542
Go forth, my Krakenstein.

06:13.625 --> 06:15.792
And destroy the Ninja!

06:15.875 --> 06:17.750
(roaring)

06:17.834 --> 06:20.667
Well, he's about ye high,
red scarf, black suit.

06:20.750 --> 06:21.792
Maybe it's navy blue.

06:23.500 --> 06:24.667
(crashing)

06:26.500 --> 06:28.250
No, you're right, it is black.

06:28.333 --> 06:31.041
You never wear red with navy blue.

06:31.125 --> 06:35.458
Now, as a ninja, I must be prepared
at any moment to do this, and this,

06:35.542 --> 06:37.792
and how could I forget this?

06:37.875 --> 06:40.250
You've been great, everybody.
See ya next time.

06:40.417 --> 06:42.083
Remember to tip those lunch ladies.

06:42.166 --> 06:44.208
-Smoke bom...
-No, wait, Ninja.

06:44.291 --> 06:46.834
My buddy and I have been dying
to meet you since we were kids.

06:46.917 --> 06:49.333
Please just hang out
until he gets back?

06:49.417 --> 06:51.417
Aw, that's really cool of you.

06:51.500 --> 06:53.083
But I can't. I must go.

06:53.166 --> 06:55.250
-(roaring)
-(all screaming)

06:55.333 --> 06:58.750
Yes, destroy. Destroy!

07:01.750 --> 07:03.083
My first monster fight.

07:03.166 --> 07:04.959
So honkin' cool!

07:05.041 --> 07:06.166
Ninja flip!

07:06.250 --> 07:08.667
Monster, get ready to get...

07:08.750 --> 07:10.000
(groans)

07:10.083 --> 07:12.375
Eesh! "Cunningham, get back here.

07:12.458 --> 07:14.333
The Ninja's totally getting pwned."

07:16.083 --> 07:17.166
(phone ringing)

07:17.250 --> 07:18.750
I wouldn't say I'm getting pwned.

07:24.542 --> 07:25.917
Uh-oh. (groaning)

07:26.000 --> 07:28.083
(grunting) What?

07:29.625 --> 07:31.792
Oh, man, I am getting pwned.

07:31.875 --> 07:33.458
Ninja sprint!

07:40.417 --> 07:42.750
I wasn't hiding from you,
if that's what you think.

07:42.834 --> 07:44.041
(roaring)

07:44.125 --> 07:46.000
(screaming)

07:48.291 --> 07:49.667
-(bell ringing)
-Now what?

07:52.375 --> 07:54.875
-(shouting)
-(thudding)

07:54.959 --> 07:56.500
Where have you been?

07:56.583 --> 07:58.542
We were supposed
to meet the Ninja together.

07:58.625 --> 08:01.625
Man, but between you and me,
he was kinda stankin' it up out there.

08:01.709 --> 08:03.375
Come on, Howard. I... uh...

08:03.458 --> 08:06.041
The Ninja was trying his best, okay?

08:06.125 --> 08:08.208
It's not like there are instructions
for being the Ninja.

08:08.291 --> 08:09.458
The instructions!

08:09.542 --> 08:12.166
I need to use the bathroom!

08:12.250 --> 08:14.625
-(gasping)
-Hey ya, Randy.

08:16.834 --> 08:18.375
The Ninja-nomicon.

08:18.458 --> 08:21.750
Come on, baby, drop some secret
ninja knowledge on me.

08:39.041 --> 08:41.792
(Randy) "Believe in the weapon
that is in the suit."

08:41.875 --> 08:42.792
Okay, what's in the suit?

08:42.875 --> 08:45.875
I'm in the suit. I'm the weapon.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.709
I just have to believe in me.

08:50.333 --> 08:52.500
-See ya, Randy.
-(gasping)

08:55.250 --> 08:56.667
Whoa!

08:56.750 --> 08:58.792
Hey, perfect, you're back.
I got some great news.

08:58.875 --> 09:00.583
Sorry, Howard,
but I have to, um...

09:00.667 --> 09:01.917
-(bell ringing)
-No, no.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.709
You are going to stick around for this.

09:03.792 --> 09:06.000
Turns out the Ninja
couldn't beat that monster,

09:06.083 --> 09:08.417
so, he just locked it
in a basement stall.

09:08.500 --> 09:10.208
So, I let it out.

09:10.291 --> 09:11.375
You did what?

09:11.458 --> 09:13.667
Yeah. Now, he's just gotta come back,

09:13.750 --> 09:16.083
and we can see him
in action together.

09:16.166 --> 09:18.041
(horn blaring)

09:19.166 --> 09:22.375
You want to thank me now or later,
or how should we do this?

09:23.583 --> 09:25.875
Where the heck is what's-his-crack?

09:27.959 --> 09:30.625
-There he is!
-My car!

09:30.709 --> 09:34.291
Ninja action, courtesy of <i>moi.</i>

09:34.375 --> 09:35.875
Who's the best friend ever?

09:35.959 --> 09:38.083
Huh? Are you kidding me?

09:40.083 --> 09:41.750
(Randy) Smoke bomb!

09:43.417 --> 09:45.875
-(grunting)
-(all) Ninja, Ninja!

09:48.875 --> 09:50.542
I believe in me,
I believe in me.

09:50.625 --> 09:53.333
I believe in me kicking your butt.

10:02.834 --> 10:04.625
Ninja block, ninja block,
ninja block, ninja block,

10:04.709 --> 10:07.542
ninja block, and ninja block.

10:11.083 --> 10:12.917
Who's getting pwned now?

10:13.000 --> 10:15.375
(all chanting) Ninja!

10:18.333 --> 10:19.375
What?

10:19.458 --> 10:22.625
Secret arm! That is so Viceroy.

10:24.417 --> 10:25.834
I don't get it. I'm believing.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.625
What else could be in the suit?

10:31.000 --> 10:33.834
Ah. Believe in the weapon
that is in the suit.

10:33.917 --> 10:35.000
(roaring)

10:35.083 --> 10:37.125
That makes way more sense.

10:37.208 --> 10:38.709
Ah!

10:39.375 --> 10:40.375
(groans)

10:40.458 --> 10:42.125
Let's do this.

10:44.333 --> 10:46.542
(Randy shouting)

10:46.625 --> 10:47.709
Stop.

10:56.834 --> 10:59.667
(screaming) No!

10:59.750 --> 11:02.500
Way, dudes.

11:02.583 --> 11:04.917
That was awesome. Ha!

11:05.000 --> 11:07.709
(all chanting) Smoke bomb!

11:07.792 --> 11:09.792
Smoke bomb!

11:10.375 --> 11:11.458
Hey, Howard.

11:11.542 --> 11:13.166
Oh, you think
I'm some sort of chowder head?

11:13.250 --> 11:15.458
I... don't know how to answer that.

11:15.542 --> 11:16.875
-I know what you've been up to.
-You do?

11:16.959 --> 11:19.166
Yeah. First, you're gone, Ninja's here.

11:19.250 --> 11:20.875
And then, he's gone,
and then you're here.

11:20.959 --> 11:22.834
I know your secret, man.

11:22.917 --> 11:24.208
Listen, I wanted to tell you.

11:24.291 --> 11:25.625
Well, it's too late now.

11:25.709 --> 11:27.041
Yeah, I figured it all out.

11:27.125 --> 11:28.875
With my mind.

11:28.959 --> 11:30.542
This is such a relief.

11:30.625 --> 11:32.834
It's been killing me
that I couldn't tell you.

11:32.917 --> 11:34.959
I mean, sneaking off
so you can have the bathroom

11:35.041 --> 11:37.417
all to yourself every time
the Ninja shows up.

11:38.417 --> 11:39.583
Wait, you're the Ninja?

11:39.667 --> 11:41.125
My best friend's the Ninja!

11:41.208 --> 11:43.792
This is incredible!
I'm gonna tell everyone.

11:43.875 --> 11:45.250
You can't tell anyone.

11:45.333 --> 11:46.250
Well, that stinks.

11:46.333 --> 11:48.000
No, Howard, this stinks.

11:48.083 --> 11:49.542
Smoke bomb!

11:49.625 --> 11:52.000
(Howard coughing) Oh, man.
Those things smell like fart.

11:52.083 --> 11:53.125
(Randy) You get used to it.

11:53.208 --> 11:54.792
You'd be surprised, you start liking it.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.834
And how is this gonna get us
seats in the cool section?

11:59.917 --> 12:02.375
Okay, trust me, Howard.
We go in there like, boom!

12:02.458 --> 12:04.000
And they're all like,
"Oh, no, you didn't!"

12:04.083 --> 12:06.083
And we're like,
"Oh, yes, we did!"

12:06.166 --> 12:07.458
Whatever, let's just do it.

12:07.542 --> 12:09.542
This stuff's making my butt itch.

12:10.333 --> 12:13.375
(cheering)

12:16.375 --> 12:17.792
(horn blowing)

12:17.875 --> 12:20.750
What up, Norrisville High!

12:26.166 --> 12:28.417
-Dorks!
-(all laughing)

12:29.750 --> 12:32.417
Oh, man.
He's talking about us.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.417
(shivering)

12:34.500 --> 12:36.500
That incredible display of school spirit

12:36.583 --> 12:38.458
was supposed to get us
into the Fishcage.

12:38.542 --> 12:39.667
(chattering)

12:39.750 --> 12:41.250
Does anyone even talk
to freshmen anymore?

12:41.333 --> 12:42.667
I can't be bothered. No way.

12:42.750 --> 12:43.834
Oh.

12:43.917 --> 12:46.583
Only the cool de la cool
get to sit there.

12:46.667 --> 12:48.458
No freshman has ever gotten in.

12:48.542 --> 12:50.583
(screaming)

12:50.667 --> 12:51.792
Nice try, Doug.

12:51.875 --> 12:53.917
Hey, at least we're not sitting
with the marching band.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.458
That section's got a splash zone.

13:04.667 --> 13:06.500
(humming)

13:06.583 --> 13:09.041
Bucky, there's no triangle solo
in this song.

13:09.125 --> 13:10.667
Or any song.

13:10.750 --> 13:11.792
(all booing)

13:11.875 --> 13:14.000
Bucky! What'd I tell you
about showboatin'?

13:14.083 --> 13:15.375
(singing)

13:15.458 --> 13:18.583
Hensletter, your triangle's writing checks
your dinger can't cash.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.000
You're benched till further notice.

13:20.083 --> 13:21.667
But the triangle's my life.

13:21.750 --> 13:23.500
Put your dinger in my hand, son.

13:23.583 --> 13:25.500
You can take my dinger,

13:25.583 --> 13:28.750
but you'll never take
my back-up dinger!

13:31.875 --> 13:33.625
(grunts)

13:33.709 --> 13:36.583
(sad trombone)

13:36.667 --> 13:38.458
Ho-ho! Sad trombone.

13:38.542 --> 13:40.291
Ultimate band burn.

13:40.375 --> 13:43.667
(sobbing)

13:51.166 --> 13:53.125
(sniffing)

13:54.875 --> 13:59.625
Mmm. Misery,
with subtle notes of humiliation,

13:59.709 --> 14:02.875
and just the slightest hint of flop sweat.

14:02.959 --> 14:06.709
Yum. He will do nicely.

14:06.792 --> 14:08.959
(sinister laughter)

14:14.750 --> 14:16.792
(shouting)

14:18.250 --> 14:20.750
They'll pay! They'll all...

14:20.834 --> 14:23.166
-(cheering)
-Hey, come on!

14:24.834 --> 14:26.041
...pay.

14:26.917 --> 14:29.625
(humming)

14:33.333 --> 14:34.667
Good game tonight, team.

14:34.750 --> 14:36.291
You played some strong D.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.792
Your B flats and A minor sevenths
weren't bad either.

14:38.875 --> 14:41.792
(sad trombone)

14:41.875 --> 14:43.625
Stevens, cool it
with the trombone jokes.

14:43.709 --> 14:46.000
-(rumbling)
-(shouting)

14:46.083 --> 14:47.542
(screeching)

14:48.333 --> 14:51.208
Ah, feels good to be out of that
humiliating body paint.

14:51.291 --> 14:54.792
Yeah, now we're just two freshmen
kicking it in Speedos.

14:54.875 --> 14:57.041
Nothing embarrassing about that.

14:57.125 --> 14:58.834
(screaming)

14:58.917 --> 15:01.375
Something tells me it's Ninja time.

15:02.750 --> 15:04.458
You're gonna put that on you face?

15:04.542 --> 15:05.959
Yes, I am.

15:06.041 --> 15:07.500
But it was in your pants!

15:07.583 --> 15:08.500
Yes, it was!

15:10.750 --> 15:12.625
(exclaiming)

15:14.208 --> 15:16.041
(all shrieking)

15:18.792 --> 15:20.083
(Randy) Smoke bomb!

15:20.166 --> 15:23.166
-(cheering)
-Drop that piano.

15:23.834 --> 15:25.375
Uh-oh.
(groaning)

15:27.583 --> 15:29.917
I probably should have
seen that coming.

15:37.792 --> 15:40.709
Princess Tootie. I almost lost you.

15:40.792 --> 15:42.291
(shouting)

15:42.375 --> 15:44.667
Hey, you, cowbell.

15:44.750 --> 15:45.709
Cowbell me.

15:49.250 --> 15:50.417
Ha!

15:55.709 --> 15:56.792
(bell tolling)

16:06.208 --> 16:07.959
Ah!

16:09.542 --> 16:11.291
Okay, so here's a question, Bucky.

16:11.375 --> 16:14.083
What exactly is going on here?

16:14.166 --> 16:15.542
Like in this... in this area?

16:15.625 --> 16:18.875
(distorted voice)
If I can't play triangle in the band,

16:18.959 --> 16:20.792
then no one will.

16:21.417 --> 16:23.458
But my no showboating policy.

16:23.542 --> 16:25.458
He was showboating.
You all saw it.

16:25.542 --> 16:27.500
(rattling)

16:29.875 --> 16:32.375
(groaning)

16:32.458 --> 16:34.166
Gonna drop it!

16:45.000 --> 16:46.750
Oh, boy.

16:48.125 --> 16:51.166
Uh...

16:51.250 --> 16:52.625
(cymbal dings)

16:52.709 --> 16:54.417
Smoke bomb!

16:55.041 --> 16:56.375
(bell ringing)

16:56.458 --> 16:59.000
I was out till curfew
looking for Bucky.

16:59.083 --> 17:01.291
You just can't find a runaway
monster on a school night.

17:01.375 --> 17:03.000
Yeah, he'll turn up eventually.

17:03.083 --> 17:04.250
Not good enough, Howard.

17:04.333 --> 17:06.959
The Ninja needs to do
something about this.

17:07.041 --> 17:09.625
No, the "Ninja" needs
to come up with a new plan

17:09.709 --> 17:11.542
to get us into the Fishcage tonight.

17:11.625 --> 17:13.500
Hey, how about you come up
with a plan for once?

17:14.500 --> 17:17.166
(both laugh)

17:17.250 --> 17:19.917
I know, it sounded stupid
the minute it came out of my mouth.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.458
It did, it really did.

17:22.542 --> 17:26.250
You can still make us the first freshmen
in the Fishcage, Cunningham.

17:26.333 --> 17:27.875
I believe in you.

17:27.959 --> 17:29.834
(yawns)

17:29.917 --> 17:32.583
Being inspiring really wipes me out.

17:34.333 --> 17:37.542
(snoring)

17:37.625 --> 17:39.542
Something turned Bucky
into a monster.

17:39.625 --> 17:42.583
Maybe the Ninja-nomicon
knows how to change him back.

17:45.458 --> 17:48.166
(Randy) "Severing the puppet's strings."

17:48.250 --> 17:49.500
What the juice?

17:49.583 --> 17:51.917
"You gotta D'stank 'em, bro!"

17:52.000 --> 17:54.125
Again, I ask. What the juice?

17:59.834 --> 18:02.250
(Randy) <i>"The evil funk</i>
<i>possesses the vulnerable,</i>

18:02.333 --> 18:04.750
<i>using that which he holds most dear."</i>

18:11.166 --> 18:13.500
I have to D'stank him, bro!

18:13.583 --> 18:16.000
Really? Yelling in the library?

18:16.083 --> 18:18.083
We got like one rule
and you just broke it.

18:18.166 --> 18:19.458
Sorry.

18:21.750 --> 18:23.333
(squeaking)

18:25.458 --> 18:26.667
(shrieking)

18:26.750 --> 18:28.375
Hello.

18:28.458 --> 18:30.709
I don't think we've met.

18:30.792 --> 18:33.041
I am The Sorcerer.

18:33.125 --> 18:36.625
I have been down here for 800 years.

18:36.709 --> 18:38.709
You've probably heard of me.

18:39.375 --> 18:40.625
(squeaking)

18:40.709 --> 18:42.000
Makes no difference.

18:42.083 --> 18:44.000
I will not be here much longer.

18:44.083 --> 18:48.166
My latest creation
is up above spreading chaos.

18:48.250 --> 18:50.917
Chaos gives me power.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.959
And once I have enough power,

18:53.041 --> 18:55.166
I will break free from this prison,

18:55.250 --> 18:57.583
and destroy the Ninja.

18:57.667 --> 19:00.667
(sinister laughter)

19:03.458 --> 19:05.667
Are you laughing with me or at me?

19:06.250 --> 19:08.417
-(squeaking)
-Good.

19:14.125 --> 19:16.041
-(Randy) Hey, man.
-So, what's the plan for...

19:16.125 --> 19:19.166
(shouts) Why are you wearing that?

19:19.250 --> 19:21.959
-I joined the marching band.
-Why are you saying that?

19:22.041 --> 19:23.333
Uh, because you asked.

19:24.083 --> 19:25.542
Hey!

19:27.291 --> 19:29.583
-How did this happen?
-I auditioned.

19:29.667 --> 19:32.041
-(dinging)
-You're in!

19:32.125 --> 19:33.458
Didn't know I was so musical, did ya'?

19:33.542 --> 19:36.208
Why, when we're trying
to sit in the cool section,

19:36.291 --> 19:38.583
did you go and join
the dorkiest dorks on Earth?

19:38.667 --> 19:40.000
I know, I know, it's bad timing.

19:40.083 --> 19:42.333
(Randy muffled) But if the band
has a new triangle player,

19:42.417 --> 19:43.875
Bucky's guaranteed to show up,

19:43.959 --> 19:45.917
and then the Ninja will take him down.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.250
Your ninja-ing is killing
any chance at popularity.

19:49.333 --> 19:50.834
It's the price I have to pay.

19:50.917 --> 19:52.792
We're paying it.

19:52.875 --> 19:55.333
We. Cunningham,
you're my best friend.

19:55.417 --> 19:57.291
But as long as you're sporting
that geek gear,

19:57.375 --> 19:58.917
I cannot be seen with you.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.959
Give me your word you'll stay in here
ten seconds after I leave.

20:02.041 --> 20:03.875
-You have my word.
-Good.

20:03.959 --> 20:06.083
(Howard) Oh, one more thing. (farts)

20:06.166 --> 20:07.667
(laughing)

20:07.750 --> 20:08.792
(Randy) Not cool, man!

20:08.875 --> 20:10.667
That is not cool!

20:10.750 --> 20:14.375
(growling, gasping)

20:14.375 --> 20:15.542
(woman) Bucky!

20:15.625 --> 20:17.917
Ain't you performing
with the band tonight, sweetheart?

20:18.000 --> 20:19.959
(screeching)

20:21.125 --> 20:22.917
(band playing)

20:23.000 --> 20:24.792
(chatter)

20:30.834 --> 20:33.792
Let us be clear.
I'm only sitting here for the snacks.

20:37.709 --> 20:41.458
(chatter, laughter)

20:41.542 --> 20:42.959
(Randy) Really?

20:43.041 --> 20:44.625
You can't be seen with me?

20:44.709 --> 20:46.750
-(thudding)
-(all gasping)

20:50.000 --> 20:51.417
(screeching)

20:51.500 --> 20:52.709
(all screaming)

20:52.792 --> 20:54.750
Hey, Howard.
Do you have the time?

20:54.834 --> 20:57.542
-I'm not doing this with you.
-Oh, what do you know?

20:57.625 --> 21:00.250
-It's Ninja o'clock.
-Dumb.

21:02.333 --> 21:04.500
(sinister laughter)

21:08.250 --> 21:09.750
(groans)

21:09.834 --> 21:13.000
(all screaming)

21:13.083 --> 21:14.166
(exclaiming)

21:15.166 --> 21:16.583
(cheering)

21:16.667 --> 21:19.917
Bucky, I do not feel right
about beating up a band geek.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.959
-But... (groans)
-(all) Ooh!

21:22.834 --> 21:25.041
-(groaning)
-He killed the snack bar.

21:25.125 --> 21:28.250
You make him pay, Ninja.
You make him pay!

21:28.333 --> 21:30.208
Okay, easy there, buddy.

21:30.291 --> 21:31.500
-(screeching)
-(shouts)

21:32.834 --> 21:34.333
(screaming)

21:35.041 --> 21:37.291
I gotta D'stank this geek.

21:37.375 --> 21:39.417
(Randy) <i>That which he holds most dear.</i>

21:39.500 --> 21:42.667
(echoing) <i>Most dear,</i>
<i>most dear, most dear.</i>

21:42.750 --> 21:43.709
Back-up dinger!

21:45.375 --> 21:46.875
Ninja flash!

21:49.333 --> 21:50.709
Ninja snatch!

22:13.083 --> 22:14.375
(whooshing)

22:14.458 --> 22:16.709
(moaning)

22:16.792 --> 22:18.208
(groaning)

22:18.291 --> 22:19.375
(all cheering)

22:19.458 --> 22:22.500
(chanting) Smoke bomb!

22:22.583 --> 22:24.333
Smoke bomb!

22:26.542 --> 22:28.834
Well, Howard, we did it.

22:28.917 --> 22:31.959
We're the first freshmen
ever to sit in the Fishcage.

22:32.041 --> 22:34.041
Technically, that is true.

22:34.125 --> 22:36.166
Aw, I guess I forgive you
for joining the band.

22:36.250 --> 22:37.750
Forgiveness accepted, buddy.

22:37.834 --> 22:39.458
Forgiveness accepted.

22:39.542 --> 22:41.083
(shivering, moaning)

22:41.166 --> 22:43.750
Hey, check it out. That guy's naked!
