WEBVTT

00:00.566 --> 00:02.334
Previously on Underground...

00:05.070 --> 00:06.371
The longer we stand out here fightin',

00:06.405 --> 00:08.006
the less chance we got
of gettin' Rosalee back.

00:08.041 --> 00:09.208
Who knows what they doin' to her?

00:09.242 --> 00:11.196
Ain't nobody care about that house girl.

00:13.381 --> 00:15.884
We have to disrupt
their happy little lives.

00:18.853 --> 00:21.390
Anyone tries to follow me,
your massa gets it.

00:23.958 --> 00:25.661
He's not the massa.

00:25.695 --> 00:27.698
I am.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:42.414 --> 00:44.716
- Bo. You can't be up here.
- I got another one.

00:44.750 --> 00:47.286
Now's not a good time.
Massa'll be out any second.

00:47.320 --> 00:48.889
I think it important.

00:51.125 --> 00:52.560
Come on.

01:03.738 --> 01:05.206
What it say?

01:06.055 --> 01:08.123
Come on, now, what it say?

01:08.155 --> 01:10.847
It says Kansas is bleeding...

01:12.849 --> 01:15.052
...and all the massas is worried about

01:15.085 --> 01:17.721
somebody named John Brown
coming across the river

01:17.756 --> 01:19.199
and stealing slaves.

01:19.232 --> 01:21.793
I heard Massa talking
to the mistress about

01:21.826 --> 01:23.369
sending all the field slaves down south.

01:23.403 --> 01:26.006
Gonna hire 'em off
to a sugar plantation.

01:26.555 --> 01:28.865
Massa Trenton sellin' his slaves
straightaway, too.

01:28.898 --> 01:33.649
"We strongly advise you
to take similar action."

01:35.255 --> 01:36.190
What does that mean?

01:38.287 --> 01:41.958
It means Massa Fellow might move
or sell me and mine soon.

01:44.425 --> 01:46.719
Daniel, I been thinkin' on it.

01:47.688 --> 01:49.563
I want you to teach me how to read, too.

01:49.588 --> 01:50.926
You don't know what you askin'.

01:50.960 --> 01:53.826
- I know the risks I get caught.
- Ain't about the risk.

01:55.378 --> 01:56.897
Reading.

01:57.287 --> 01:59.033
It's a curse.

01:59.067 --> 02:02.404
All the words, they gave voice

02:02.437 --> 02:04.640
to feelings I never told nobody.

02:04.674 --> 02:06.476
Not even my Bette.

02:06.508 --> 02:09.145
And I'm crushin' under
the weight of the knowledge.

02:10.007 --> 02:12.147
It opens up the world
to you and shows you

02:12.182 --> 02:15.007
how small the one
they got us chained to is.

03:18.350 --> 03:21.337
What do you see when you
look at this sculpture?

03:24.065 --> 03:25.700
Timelessness.

03:26.057 --> 03:27.136
Hmm.

03:27.170 --> 03:29.972
At one time, in his time,

03:30.545 --> 03:32.441
he was just like us.

03:33.076 --> 03:35.812
Now, cast in a different form,
he's hardened.

03:35.845 --> 03:37.226
Immortal.

03:37.849 --> 03:40.085
He's been afforded some greater purpose.

03:40.117 --> 03:41.697
A second life.

03:42.873 --> 03:45.257
Who do you suppose he was before?

03:47.345 --> 03:49.695
There's such strength in his stance.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.366
The way his eyes look beyond everything.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.868
It's like they've never known defeat.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.370
Perhaps a warrior?

03:56.403 --> 03:57.737
Or a leader of men.

04:01.811 --> 04:03.014
You see something else?

04:03.046 --> 04:04.508
What he's carved from.

04:05.917 --> 04:09.384
We can't see him without looking
at a shadow of ourselves.

04:09.419 --> 04:11.388
Maybe that's his purpose.

04:11.420 --> 04:13.256
A standard, demanding better of us.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.060
If only we, too, were carved of stone.

04:16.610 --> 04:18.833
But what's the fun in that?

04:24.303 --> 04:26.302
At least we can be
grateful to the donor,

04:26.695 --> 04:27.808
Mr. Powell,

04:27.840 --> 04:30.379
for sponsoring such a rare
and daring work.

04:32.679 --> 04:35.783
Pardon me. Your carriage
is waiting, Mr. Powell.

04:43.803 --> 04:47.709
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

04:48.132 --> 04:50.349
A reporter from the Ripley Bee
has confirmed their appearance.

04:50.381 --> 04:52.268
That paper has a wide circulation

04:52.301 --> 04:53.671
on both sides of the river.

04:53.705 --> 04:54.906
It's just the kind of exposure

04:54.938 --> 04:56.176
we need to influence the vote.

04:56.209 --> 04:58.952
We should open with our best
arguments against the reform.

04:59.046 --> 05:01.349
Or draw him in by tugging
on his heartstrings first.

05:01.383 --> 05:03.484
The recitation of the Frances
Harper poem should do that.

05:03.517 --> 05:04.777
What's the current speaking order?

05:04.811 --> 05:06.056
Elizabeth has the list.

05:08.348 --> 05:10.225
Elizabeth?

05:10.593 --> 05:11.693
The list?

05:12.948 --> 05:14.198
Yes, uh...

05:14.231 --> 05:15.699
um, I have it here.

05:15.731 --> 05:17.133
S-Somewhere.

05:17.167 --> 05:18.535
Um...

05:18.568 --> 05:20.138
Why don't we get this outside?

05:20.171 --> 05:22.413
- It'll dry quicker.
- Okay. Great.

05:33.585 --> 05:35.222
If this is too much

05:35.255 --> 05:37.392
or if it's too fast after John,

05:37.424 --> 05:39.025
- we do not have to...
- No, it's...

05:39.598 --> 05:40.601
Here it is.

05:43.620 --> 05:45.901
I was surprised
not to see your name on it.

05:45.935 --> 05:48.004
I'm a better organizer than an orator.

05:48.628 --> 05:50.212
That's not true.

05:51.164 --> 05:52.909
The passion you evoke
in everyday conversation

05:52.943 --> 05:54.577
when speaking about the cause,

05:54.611 --> 05:56.614
it inspires me to action.

05:56.647 --> 05:58.849
I'm sure others would feel the same.

05:58.883 --> 06:00.519
Isn't that what this rally is for?

06:01.084 --> 06:02.253
Perhaps.

06:02.287 --> 06:03.921
But someone needs to be on hand

06:03.955 --> 06:06.092
to watch over those boys from Lawrence.

06:06.125 --> 06:08.528
They'll do anything to keep
a pro-slavery legislator

06:08.561 --> 06:10.430
from taking that seat.

06:11.317 --> 06:13.434
The way you all speak
about them, I mean,

06:13.996 --> 06:16.437
how rough a crowd should I be expecting?

06:16.470 --> 06:17.796
Honestly?

06:18.239 --> 06:21.542
Mr. Brown's followers
are always up to something.

06:21.577 --> 06:24.914
We all want the same outcome
when it comes to abolition,

06:24.947 --> 06:27.697
but we believe in
very different methods.

06:28.091 --> 06:31.488
I read about the raids his men
carried out a few months back.

06:31.743 --> 06:34.256
Slaughtering sleeping families
with swords.

06:34.291 --> 06:36.993
It... seems unbelievable.
I thought it was

06:37.027 --> 06:38.262
just Southern propaganda.

06:38.296 --> 06:40.351
Some of it is, but...

06:44.175 --> 06:45.422
Do you hear that?

06:45.455 --> 06:46.592
I do.

06:47.766 --> 06:49.068
It's coming from the tunnel.

07:24.771 --> 07:25.852
Rosalee?

07:27.419 --> 07:28.754
Rosalee.

08:26.688 --> 08:29.458
Plant your feet and watch my shoulder.

08:29.493 --> 08:32.195
My eyes can lie,
but my shoulder drops in.

08:32.926 --> 08:36.542
Keep your hands up. Block. There.

08:37.167 --> 08:40.806
I've seen many a fighter go down
at the hands of his opponent.

08:40.840 --> 08:43.285
But many more knock themselves out.

08:55.442 --> 08:57.291
That's enough for today.

09:18.956 --> 09:20.619
What the hell am I doin' here?

09:22.901 --> 09:24.290
You're welcome.

09:24.322 --> 09:25.524
For the bed.

09:25.557 --> 09:26.640
For the suit.

09:27.646 --> 09:30.163
For not turning you back over
to the marshals to hang.

09:30.196 --> 09:31.602
I ain't thankin' you for none of that.

09:31.636 --> 09:33.500
You haven't been to
Philadelphia before, have you?

09:35.469 --> 09:37.806
No, of course you haven't.

09:40.481 --> 09:43.145
How 'bout we stretch our legs then?

09:58.830 --> 10:00.465
Watch it, you bloody wog.

10:00.498 --> 10:01.566
Come again, friend?

10:01.599 --> 10:02.435
Cato, don't.

10:04.055 --> 10:06.392
Let's just have another drink, okay?

10:08.393 --> 10:10.062
All right. One more drink.

10:27.096 --> 10:28.393
Cato, no!

10:38.020 --> 10:39.845
Next round's on me.

10:39.878 --> 10:41.580
You're crazy.

10:41.614 --> 10:42.849
Devi, I wasn't looking for a fight,

10:42.882 --> 10:44.250
- but he insulted you.
- Words.

10:44.283 --> 10:46.719
He used words against me.

10:46.753 --> 10:49.590
Petty and terrible, but nothing
worse than a child's tantrum.

10:49.623 --> 10:51.558
- Congratulations on obliging him in that.
- I was protecting you.

10:51.591 --> 10:54.628
You were no more protecting me
than I was in actual danger.

10:54.662 --> 10:57.270
You think your money means
you can do whatever you want.

10:57.304 --> 10:58.377
I can.

10:59.291 --> 11:00.436
Then why aren't you?

11:00.976 --> 11:03.906
Because everywhere you take me,
there's no reflections of us.

11:03.940 --> 11:06.309
It's just rich and white,
it's like you're trying

11:06.341 --> 11:07.710
to prove you belong there.

11:07.744 --> 11:09.046
This is the first time
I'm hearing you complain

11:09.079 --> 11:11.181
about the life my money affords you.

11:14.852 --> 11:15.872
Stop.

11:15.985 --> 11:17.231
Devi, stop...

11:17.264 --> 11:19.090
No, don't touch me!

11:19.124 --> 11:20.893
I don't want your money or your things.

11:20.926 --> 11:21.760
Then what do you want?

11:21.793 --> 11:23.095
I want to know you.

11:23.893 --> 11:26.470
There is much
in your past you keep hidden.

11:26.810 --> 11:29.269
I was hoping, in time, you'd
trust me enough to tell me.

11:29.302 --> 11:30.671
It's not about trust, I trust you.

11:30.705 --> 11:31.772
Then tell me.

11:31.806 --> 11:33.008
Why?

11:33.041 --> 11:34.642
You couldn't understand anyway.

11:34.676 --> 11:36.277
What exactly would I fail to understand?

11:36.311 --> 11:39.615
I'm British Indian at a time
when one occupies the other.

11:39.649 --> 11:42.084
Looked at as different and dangerous.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.287
I've been called every slur in
the book. And I've been called

11:44.320 --> 11:46.522
- every slur without the word
ever being said. - Devi, just...

11:46.556 --> 11:49.493
Being treated less-than
is not an American invention.

11:49.527 --> 11:52.796
You, and you alone, do not own
the pain and humiliation of it.

11:52.830 --> 11:54.498
What I've seen, what I've done...

11:54.532 --> 11:56.835
if I tell you, you wouldn't
be able to look at me.

11:56.868 --> 11:59.739
You wouldn't see a man,
you would see a monster!

12:11.910 --> 12:14.109
I'm not going anywhere.

12:28.915 --> 12:33.453
Two drops of the laudanum,
three times a day.

12:33.487 --> 12:36.170
And that will keep her under.

12:37.518 --> 12:40.947
When her body has time to heal,
we'll start to wean her off it.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.639
Will it affect the baby?

12:42.672 --> 12:43.911
It shouldn't.

12:43.945 --> 12:44.986
But you're not sure?

12:45.019 --> 12:47.401
Without knowing the extent
of what she endured,

12:47.434 --> 12:49.469
there's, there's just no knowing.

12:52.685 --> 12:54.776
I must get back to the hospital.

12:54.809 --> 12:56.944
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

12:56.978 --> 12:58.814
Anything for the cause.

12:58.847 --> 13:00.912
I'll keep her in my prayers.

13:05.521 --> 13:06.923
Look at her.

13:07.911 --> 13:10.161
They beat a woman carrying a child

13:10.194 --> 13:12.096
to within an inch of her life.

13:12.128 --> 13:13.163
She's a fighter.

13:13.198 --> 13:14.800
She'll pull through it.

13:14.833 --> 13:16.001
She shouldn't have to.

13:18.596 --> 13:20.037
Sorry.

13:20.071 --> 13:23.775
It's just, how do you reason with people

13:23.809 --> 13:25.773
capable of this level of violence?

13:26.747 --> 13:28.482
Georgia?

13:28.515 --> 13:29.984
The Lawrence boys are here.

13:39.776 --> 13:42.415
I can't lose you, too.

14:08.628 --> 14:10.897
Has the gentleman had a chance
to read the menu?

14:14.254 --> 14:16.903
We'll both have
the lapin à la bourguignonne.

14:22.446 --> 14:25.615
So, you got all the way up to Ohio

14:25.648 --> 14:27.116
from Georgia.

14:27.150 --> 14:28.852
At least, I'm assuming you made it

14:28.886 --> 14:30.588
across the bridge.

14:30.621 --> 14:33.257
I couldn't quite make it out
from my vantage point.

14:33.291 --> 14:35.126
So that's what this is all about.

14:35.160 --> 14:36.257
'Cause I left you behind...

14:36.289 --> 14:37.896
You left me for dead.

14:38.292 --> 14:39.732
And this is about having

14:39.765 --> 14:41.233
an honest conversation.

14:41.267 --> 14:42.736
Like gentlemen.

14:44.325 --> 14:45.271
But I get it.

14:45.305 --> 14:47.373
You don't want to talk, 'cause you think

14:47.407 --> 14:48.644
you got a plan.

14:49.561 --> 14:51.897
First step in your plan
right now is to take me down

14:51.922 --> 14:54.195
with that knife you got
hidden under the table.

14:55.042 --> 14:57.378
Next, you think you gone run
right past Erroll and Roderick,

14:57.403 --> 14:59.606
and be out the restaurant before
they have a chance to do shit.

14:59.856 --> 15:01.285
But then what?

15:02.565 --> 15:03.977
Those two guys?

15:04.006 --> 15:05.341
By the door?

15:06.598 --> 15:08.232
Mine.

15:09.165 --> 15:11.237
The men outside? The police?

15:11.270 --> 15:13.671
You know, the one good thing
about America is that money

15:13.704 --> 15:16.941
can buy a lot of strong,
powerful, armed friends.

15:20.145 --> 15:22.315
I kind of want to see you try.

15:24.383 --> 15:25.958
But then I think,

15:28.289 --> 15:30.525
when was the last time you slept?

15:32.219 --> 15:35.522
Does Noah got the strength in
him for another failed escape?

15:36.518 --> 15:38.975
Can he stare out
through them bars again?

15:40.711 --> 15:43.063
How long can his beard grow this time?

15:43.791 --> 15:46.039
A lot of questions come to mind.

15:47.176 --> 15:50.296
But I wonder, for the life
of me, do they ever enter yours?

15:52.599 --> 15:54.485
Truth be told, I don't think
you ever think about

15:54.518 --> 15:57.455
what happens after your brilliant plans.

15:57.903 --> 16:00.866
So I did the thinking
this time, for you.

16:09.503 --> 16:11.570
What happens after this here plan?

16:12.574 --> 16:14.089
You die.

16:14.776 --> 16:17.149
And you leave that house girl all alone

16:17.182 --> 16:19.014
to mourn you.

16:45.378 --> 16:48.582
I have my brother to thank for
my introduction to boxing.

16:48.616 --> 16:51.619
He trained for years
as a musti-yuddha fighter.

16:55.491 --> 16:56.893
Oh!

16:56.925 --> 16:59.004
Now who among you's
feeling bricky tonight?

16:59.491 --> 17:01.129
'Cause I've got a hundred quid

17:01.164 --> 17:03.032
for any of you lot
who think you can survive

17:03.066 --> 17:04.468
three rounds with me!

17:04.501 --> 17:05.769
This man here.

17:23.321 --> 17:24.557
Come on!

17:30.165 --> 17:31.800
Get over here.

17:31.832 --> 17:34.235
The violence. Stop swallowing it.

17:34.269 --> 17:35.518
It's a part of you.

17:35.551 --> 17:37.006
It's in there.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.643
Put it in here.

17:38.668 --> 17:41.478
Let yourself be angry.
You deserve to be.

17:41.512 --> 17:43.686
Take it out on them. And enjoy it.

17:43.720 --> 17:45.750
Fight, for the loss you suffered.

17:45.782 --> 17:47.517
For revenge, on those that scarred you

17:47.551 --> 17:48.786
and took your family.

17:48.819 --> 17:50.288
For every slight, big or small,

17:50.320 --> 17:52.461
you suffered for daring
to exist in their world.

17:52.495 --> 17:55.054
Let them know you do not forget.

17:57.829 --> 17:59.126
Anything else?

17:59.159 --> 18:00.293
Yes.

18:11.547 --> 18:13.955
Of course I believe
that we can influence the vote.

18:13.989 --> 18:16.191
I have faith in people
to do the right thing.

18:16.223 --> 18:18.327
Faith is meaningless
when not supported by action.

18:18.360 --> 18:19.328
Well, not everyone is corrupt.

18:19.362 --> 18:20.363
There are enough who are.

18:20.395 --> 18:21.597
And the system's corrupt.

18:21.631 --> 18:22.832
The 1855 vote.

18:22.866 --> 18:24.000
It's a perfect example.

18:24.033 --> 18:25.635
Thousands of Southern Yankees

18:25.668 --> 18:27.337
crossed into Kansas
and voted for a legislature

18:27.370 --> 18:28.771
that was pro-slavery.

18:28.806 --> 18:30.208
It was a fraud,
and that can happen here too,

18:30.241 --> 18:31.343
and we'll lose that seat.

18:31.375 --> 18:32.943
To be sure, but fraud

18:32.977 --> 18:34.813
is hardly worthy
of the free-stater's response.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.137
How so?

18:36.170 --> 18:38.257
- The murder of five innocent settlers?
- Mm-hmm.

18:38.289 --> 18:40.886
Those who uphold the institution
of slavery deal in brutality.

18:40.921 --> 18:42.759
Action is all that they understand.

18:42.792 --> 18:44.804
We live in a peaceful society.

18:44.838 --> 18:46.226
And they do not.

18:47.090 --> 18:48.829
I don't speak to a Scottish man
in French.

18:48.863 --> 18:50.664
I speak to him in a language
that he understands.

18:50.697 --> 18:52.499
Vous ne parlez pas de lui en Français

18:52.533 --> 18:55.378
parce que vous ne savez pas Français.

18:55.411 --> 18:56.539
Excuse me?

18:56.571 --> 18:57.872
She said, "You don't
speak to him in French,

18:57.906 --> 18:59.041
because you do not know French."

19:02.345 --> 19:04.247
That's true. But I do know

19:04.280 --> 19:06.483
- slavery needs to end.
- On that we agree.

19:06.517 --> 19:07.585
I've also seen enough
to know the captain's way

19:07.617 --> 19:08.719
is the only way.

19:09.315 --> 19:10.520
War is the only way.

19:10.555 --> 19:12.224
It's women and children
who are affected most

19:12.257 --> 19:14.161
when men wage war.

19:14.194 --> 19:16.193
By condoning it, we're
condemning husbands and sons

19:16.228 --> 19:17.730
to the slaughter.

19:18.566 --> 19:21.033
I'm sorry, I haven't had the pleasure.

19:21.068 --> 19:22.169
Elizabeth.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.337
Elizabeth.

19:23.369 --> 19:24.871
You mean the white ones.

19:25.245 --> 19:27.040
Husbands and sons?

19:27.294 --> 19:28.872
The black ones are already condemned.

19:28.905 --> 19:32.113
And who do you think will be
affected most by your war?

19:32.145 --> 19:34.751
Those yet in bondage, who
cannot protect themselves

19:34.786 --> 19:36.352
that will suffer retaliation,

19:36.906 --> 19:39.835
Or perhaps they'll be
inspired to join our ranks.

19:40.490 --> 19:42.025
Together we'll strike a blow

19:42.058 --> 19:43.926
to the heart of slavery
once and for all.

19:44.442 --> 19:46.967
Hmm, well, since you boys

19:46.999 --> 19:48.578
will be in attendance at the rally,

19:48.612 --> 19:51.521
I shall recruit you in
helping erect the grandstand.

19:51.802 --> 19:54.200
I'm sure Thad ad Elliot will
avail themselves to you.

19:54.606 --> 19:56.407
I have some business to attend to.

19:56.442 --> 19:57.943
What business?

19:57.977 --> 20:00.480
Just a quick ride,
but if you're worried about me,

20:00.512 --> 20:02.214
perhaps Elizabeth will join.

20:02.249 --> 20:03.985
As chaperone.

20:04.018 --> 20:06.421
To ensure I stay out of this
trouble you accuse me of.

20:17.453 --> 20:19.543
What do you supposed
should happen to you now?

20:20.474 --> 20:24.273
Is it a long and prosperous life
with Rosalee?

20:24.690 --> 20:26.866
Should you actually
get your freedom dream?

20:26.899 --> 20:29.680
- Why not?
- Why not? Why you?

20:30.297 --> 20:31.616
What makes you so special?

20:31.650 --> 20:32.949
Why do you get to be here? Hell...

20:32.982 --> 20:34.848
everybody got a freedom dream.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.458
Welcome to mine.

20:39.992 --> 20:44.092
No. You the one who ain't
supposed to be here.

20:44.792 --> 20:47.602
I ain't leave you behind to die.

20:47.635 --> 20:49.103
I threw you something
to defend yourself with,

20:49.136 --> 20:50.789
'cause I felt sorry for you.

20:50.823 --> 20:52.875
- You felt sorry...
- I ain't through yet.

20:54.644 --> 20:56.212
You can sit there

20:56.244 --> 20:57.847
in your pristine clothes

20:57.879 --> 21:00.816
speaking with the proper
white man's tongue.

21:01.846 --> 21:03.778
And you can fool everyone outside there

21:03.810 --> 21:05.856
in the civilized world. You can
feel everyone up in here,

21:05.889 --> 21:07.358
but you can't fool me.

21:08.070 --> 21:09.738
You're still

21:09.771 --> 21:12.130
the snake of a slave driver you was

21:12.164 --> 21:13.442
when you left Macon.

21:14.602 --> 21:16.670
I seen you.

21:17.671 --> 21:19.873
You ain't good enough
for this here life.

21:20.289 --> 21:22.542
I ain't talking about the money

21:22.576 --> 21:24.241
or even the freedom.

21:24.846 --> 21:27.915
You ain't enough of a man
to earn drawing breath.

21:29.049 --> 21:32.520
And the thing is, you know it.

21:32.554 --> 21:35.324
Everyone around you knows it.

21:35.357 --> 21:37.394
Everyone who's ever known you.

22:48.723 --> 22:50.715
I thought you wanted
an honest conversation.

22:51.526 --> 22:54.496
That's what you wanted, right?
You wanted to talk, let's talk.

22:54.530 --> 22:57.558
Let's talk about
why I'm sitting here and why

22:57.592 --> 22:59.328
you ain't out there
looking for your wife

22:59.360 --> 23:00.970
and your lost little girl.

23:01.813 --> 23:03.782
I don't see 'em
up in that big, pretty house.

23:03.815 --> 23:05.179
What you know about family?

23:05.665 --> 23:06.886
You got none to worry about.

23:06.919 --> 23:09.589
Noah only cares about Noah!

23:25.274 --> 23:29.011
But you wouldn't have made it
off that plantation without me.

23:29.723 --> 23:31.227
Or Moses

23:32.787 --> 23:34.116
or Henry.

23:37.721 --> 23:39.423
Yeah.

23:39.623 --> 23:41.780
They deaths on me.

23:42.259 --> 23:45.964
And I would do anything
to change it all if I could.

23:50.067 --> 23:51.362
Good.

23:52.405 --> 23:55.108
'Cause now you gon' have
your chance to prove it.

23:58.546 --> 24:00.449
Show your true colors.

24:08.324 --> 24:10.392
Today we're gonna exercise our right.

24:10.823 --> 24:12.529
This town we're in is destitute.

24:13.033 --> 24:14.412
And desperate.

24:14.797 --> 24:16.299
Tomorrow the people
are gonna vote overwhelmingly

24:16.334 --> 24:18.268
to put another rich planter
in that seat.

24:18.302 --> 24:20.621
And he isn't gonna do anything for 'em.

24:21.227 --> 24:23.823
The people in this town who are
angry with no way to express it

24:23.855 --> 24:25.563
are gonna vote with their hate.

24:25.595 --> 24:27.912
And I'm gonna do
something to counter that.

24:27.947 --> 24:29.916
'Cause you know what the alternative is?

24:29.949 --> 24:31.239
Doing nothing.

24:31.271 --> 24:32.706
That's not the captain's way.

24:49.939 --> 24:51.941
Should discourage them tomorrow,
don't you think?

24:51.975 --> 24:54.979
If there had been voters here
would you have turned back?

24:55.011 --> 24:56.412
Nope.

24:56.447 --> 24:57.983
What happened

24:58.016 --> 25:01.018
to make you willing
to go to such extremes?

25:04.515 --> 25:06.885
I grew up on the Missouri border.

25:07.125 --> 25:10.462
Walked to school every morning
past this tobacco plantation.

25:10.497 --> 25:13.100
Same black faces,
working the same crops.

25:13.403 --> 25:15.909
I didn't think anything of it.
I was just a boy.

25:17.650 --> 25:19.140
And then, when I was about nine,

25:19.172 --> 25:23.044
on that same path, I heard this sound.

25:23.483 --> 25:25.443
It stopped me in my tracks.

25:25.882 --> 25:28.351
Never heard anything like it,
and I haven't since.

25:29.146 --> 25:30.281
I walked to the edge of the field

25:30.315 --> 25:31.554
and there's a man, he'd been

25:31.587 --> 25:33.691
beaten bloody and locked
in the stocks as punishment.

25:33.723 --> 25:35.158
That sound...

25:36.727 --> 25:38.229
...was his son.

25:40.731 --> 25:43.668
To say that he was crying
doesn't do it justice.

25:45.004 --> 25:46.806
Every day I walked to and from school,

25:46.838 --> 25:48.807
that man and his son were there.

25:48.841 --> 25:50.810
He watched his father

25:50.844 --> 25:53.680
waste away in those stocks.

25:53.712 --> 25:56.215
The overseer gave him
just enough water to stay alive,

25:56.249 --> 25:57.477
nothing more.

26:02.123 --> 26:04.093
My mother would give me

26:04.125 --> 26:06.094
a piece of bread and some cheese.

26:06.531 --> 26:08.764
Sometimes an apple, too, for lunch.

26:10.866 --> 26:12.835
And every day I promised myself

26:12.870 --> 26:14.906
that day I would
walk right up to that man

26:14.939 --> 26:16.407
and I would give it to him.

26:16.440 --> 26:17.875
Damn the consequences.

26:18.843 --> 26:20.178
And you never did.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.619
One afternoon, on my way home,
the man was gone.

26:28.054 --> 26:30.023
The boy was still there, and...

26:30.056 --> 26:32.058
I walked over to him.
Do you know what he said to me?

26:32.370 --> 26:33.960
What?

26:35.261 --> 26:36.482
Nothing.

26:37.265 --> 26:38.900
Because he doesn't exist.

26:39.955 --> 26:41.769
Why do you assume

26:41.804 --> 26:43.739
that I need some deep personal reason

26:43.771 --> 26:45.774
to fight this war?

26:45.807 --> 26:47.289
Slavery is wrong.

26:47.896 --> 26:50.314
I know that. You know that.

26:50.346 --> 26:51.882
Your late husband knew it.

26:51.914 --> 26:55.118
He was shot in cold blood because of it.

26:55.152 --> 26:57.154
Now, ain't that enough reason

26:57.188 --> 26:59.925
to take up arms to end it?

27:39.073 --> 27:40.505
What's your name?

27:40.538 --> 27:42.084
Joseph, sir.

27:42.874 --> 27:44.943
Nice biblical name.

27:45.461 --> 27:46.880
Like Ezekiel.

27:49.181 --> 27:51.218
I have to admit,
I wasn't sure you were gonna

27:51.250 --> 27:52.885
open up about this.

27:53.490 --> 27:55.927
But I was moved by
what you said earlier.

27:55.959 --> 27:57.891
About the part of sacrificing yourself.

27:57.925 --> 28:00.328
And I believed you.
I want to believe you.

28:02.663 --> 28:04.092
So here's the deal.

28:05.235 --> 28:08.071
You agree to go with this slaver here,

28:08.104 --> 28:10.000
and submit yourself willingly

28:10.035 --> 28:11.483
back into bondage...

28:12.776 --> 28:15.546
and I'll buy these
men and women their freedom.

28:25.418 --> 28:27.327
It-it felt like, to me, you were

28:27.361 --> 28:28.729
fairly certain of what you were gonna do

28:28.761 --> 28:30.364
if you had a chance to do it all again.

28:30.396 --> 28:32.514
Well, here it is.

28:38.226 --> 28:40.040
Be the hero.

28:40.491 --> 28:42.444
You just got to go south

28:42.478 --> 28:44.754
and these people go free.

29:09.809 --> 29:11.311
No.

29:19.187 --> 29:20.471
No.

30:00.502 --> 30:02.338
Come on. Come on!

30:23.829 --> 30:26.566
One! Two!

30:26.600 --> 30:29.703
Three! Four!

30:29.737 --> 30:31.973
Five!

30:32.006 --> 30:34.575
Get on your feet! Come on!

30:34.608 --> 30:36.810
- Get on your feet!
- Get up! Cato,

30:36.844 --> 30:39.181
get up! Get up!

30:39.213 --> 30:41.583
Get up!

31:26.726 --> 31:29.062
- "All of us, in the eyes of this country..."
- "Ye may not know how desolate

31:29.096 --> 31:31.030
"Are bosoms rudely forced to part,

31:31.065 --> 31:33.702
"And how a dull and heavy weight

31:34.269 --> 31:35.736
"Will press the life-drops

31:35.770 --> 31:37.271
"from the heart.

31:37.306 --> 31:40.476
"The sale began...
young girls were there,

31:40.509 --> 31:42.878
Defenseless in their wretchedness..."

31:42.913 --> 31:44.548
"All of us, in the eyes of this country,

31:44.580 --> 31:48.050
are one important thread of our fabric."

31:48.627 --> 31:50.087
Georgia, is that...?

31:50.120 --> 31:51.822
A speech? Yes.

31:51.856 --> 31:53.791
What made you change your mind?

31:53.825 --> 31:55.460
You did.

31:55.493 --> 31:58.963
And if I must admit, Lucas, as well.

31:58.997 --> 32:00.833
His talk of action...

32:00.866 --> 32:03.270
it doesn't necessarily
have to mean violence.

32:03.302 --> 32:05.638
Words have power, too.

32:05.672 --> 32:07.440
"...bartered them for gold."

32:37.309 --> 32:38.478
Georgia...

32:50.674 --> 32:53.679
_

33:03.014 --> 33:04.640
"I stand before you today

33:04.674 --> 33:08.178
"and ask that you consider
two simple truths.

33:09.435 --> 33:11.915
"The first comes from our founders:

33:12.371 --> 33:14.186
"'All men are created equal.'

33:15.044 --> 33:17.932
"All of us, in the eyes
of this country, are

33:18.470 --> 33:21.073
"one important thread of our fabric.

33:21.624 --> 33:24.949
"The second comes from the Lord himself:

33:25.840 --> 33:28.702
"'Do unto others as you would
have others do unto you.'

33:29.962 --> 33:32.741
"I ask that you listen to your reason

33:32.773 --> 33:35.542
"and intuition, so
together, we can put an end

33:35.577 --> 33:37.712
to this abomination of slavery."

33:39.616 --> 33:41.751
"I have committed myself fully

33:41.784 --> 33:44.387
"in striving to eradicate
this plague on our nation,

33:44.421 --> 33:46.556
and I ask that you join me."

34:04.277 --> 34:06.195
As it stands,

34:06.679 --> 34:09.951
the rules governing our society
are failing this country.

34:11.853 --> 34:15.424
What kind of nation
creates laws that both abolish

34:15.458 --> 34:19.963
and uphold such a cruel
and inhumane institution?

34:19.996 --> 34:22.398
Federal law versus states' rights?

34:22.431 --> 34:25.268
It's impossible, irrational.

34:25.302 --> 34:28.472
And if it's continued, it will
make murderers of us all.

34:32.610 --> 34:34.145
If it makes you feel any better...

34:35.646 --> 34:36.949
No.

34:36.982 --> 34:38.750
Every day it is becoming

34:38.784 --> 34:39.920
clearer that there is no such thing

34:39.953 --> 34:41.521
as a middle ground!

34:41.554 --> 34:46.126
Inaction is nothing but a slow death,

34:46.159 --> 34:50.263
poison running through us, building up.

34:50.297 --> 34:52.766
Every citizen must make a choice.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.136
Are you for the cause?

34:54.168 --> 34:56.038
Or are you against us?

34:56.072 --> 35:00.043
Slavery is violence. Full stop.

35:02.045 --> 35:04.547
And those who hold fast to its aggression

35:04.581 --> 35:06.851
are refusing peace and testing

35:06.884 --> 35:09.020
the limits of the peaceful.

35:09.054 --> 35:12.224
Those who make peace impossible

35:12.257 --> 35:15.626
make violence inevitable!

35:43.693 --> 35:45.896
Always the man with the plan, but what?

35:45.929 --> 35:47.164
You can't finish a fair fight?

35:47.197 --> 35:48.833
Ain't nothin' fair about this.

35:48.867 --> 35:51.336
Ain't nothing fair about
any of what you put me through.

35:51.836 --> 35:55.707
I helped folks, I saved folks,
I set folks free.

35:55.741 --> 35:56.842
When is it my turn?

35:56.875 --> 35:58.343
What you plan to do about it?

35:58.652 --> 35:59.996
Hmm?

36:02.549 --> 36:05.027
They already killin' enough of us.

36:07.088 --> 36:09.252
And I ain't about to help 'em.

36:12.341 --> 36:14.129
That's where we different.

36:21.254 --> 36:22.405
Get him out of here.

36:24.550 --> 36:25.811
You!

36:53.976 --> 36:55.811
So this is all I get?

36:55.844 --> 36:57.532
The deed to your flat?

36:58.181 --> 37:00.250
You asked me to marry you,

37:00.284 --> 37:03.205
and now you treat me like a whore. Why?

37:10.329 --> 37:11.998
Is that where I failed?

37:12.392 --> 37:15.967
You need someone to hurt you?

37:16.001 --> 37:17.804
To remind you that you're nothing?

37:17.837 --> 37:20.401
That you're just worthless property?

37:29.200 --> 37:31.753
I thought you wanted better.

37:33.355 --> 37:34.924
I do.

38:18.615 --> 38:19.976
Elizabeth!

38:20.010 --> 38:21.979
No. We have got to get out of here now.

38:22.493 --> 38:24.630
Come on. Come on.

39:01.959 --> 39:03.928
Seven sad souls?

39:03.961 --> 39:06.861
Already on a boat to Canada,
free papers and all.

39:10.717 --> 39:12.603
Miss Rosalee told me
all about the Macon Seven

39:12.637 --> 39:15.173
and how you led them, and I have to say,

39:15.206 --> 39:17.042
it is one of the more heroic stories

39:17.077 --> 39:18.712
I have heard in all my years.

39:19.354 --> 39:21.080
No.

39:23.046 --> 39:24.651
No.

39:30.340 --> 39:31.891
I lied.

39:33.533 --> 39:34.830
I cheated.

39:37.269 --> 39:39.036
I killed.

39:40.123 --> 39:43.830
Every bad thing I done was
about protectin' me and mine.

39:44.407 --> 39:46.743
You didn't keep
your hands up, you didn't block.

39:46.778 --> 39:48.413
You can't block if you're punching.

39:48.877 --> 39:51.014
Couldn't you see
he wasn't getting tired?

39:51.784 --> 39:54.486
A man's got to decide what
kind of fighter he's gonna be.

39:56.311 --> 39:58.206
You can run from blows,

39:59.174 --> 40:00.727
or you can throw 'em.

40:00.760 --> 40:02.496
Now, if everyone would have made it,

40:02.528 --> 40:04.430
I-I'd have been happy,

40:04.465 --> 40:06.468
so happy.

40:07.504 --> 40:09.105
But they didn't.

40:10.376 --> 40:12.307
They ain't free.

40:12.340 --> 40:14.242
They ain't never gonna be.

40:15.536 --> 40:16.646
And now,

40:18.177 --> 40:20.416
what I fear most...

40:21.529 --> 40:23.285
is knowing

40:24.072 --> 40:25.689
what I'd do for my freedom.

40:26.313 --> 40:27.157
The difference between

40:27.191 --> 40:28.626
me and Noah, between me and the rest

40:28.660 --> 40:29.995
of the world, is that everyone else

40:30.028 --> 40:32.114
hides what they really are.

40:33.611 --> 40:34.867
Everybody's selfish.

40:36.553 --> 40:38.972
Looking for whatever bit
of power they can find

40:39.006 --> 40:40.608
and calling it freedom.

40:40.640 --> 40:42.976
Henry's dead 'cause of me.

40:44.579 --> 40:46.592
But I'm here,

40:47.929 --> 40:50.552
and I wouldn't change a thing.

40:51.854 --> 40:53.968
I want to be here.

40:54.523 --> 40:56.693
I ain't know enough words, Mr. Still,

40:56.727 --> 41:01.398
to explain that feeling that
I got up under my skin that...

41:01.430 --> 41:04.702
to-to explain who I am.

41:07.096 --> 41:09.464
But I know heroic ain't it.

41:12.244 --> 41:15.648
You gave those men and women
something they never had.

41:16.073 --> 41:17.417
When you asked them to run with you,

41:17.450 --> 41:19.186
you gave them a choice.

41:20.732 --> 41:22.155
I chose to come back 'cause

41:22.189 --> 41:24.526
now I see what this country needs.

41:26.394 --> 41:28.801
It needs to be torn down to nothing.

41:29.564 --> 41:32.835
It needs a forest fire,
a biblical flood,

41:32.869 --> 41:35.805
an earthquake that rips it in half.

41:39.167 --> 41:40.554
It needs me.
