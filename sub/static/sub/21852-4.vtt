What on Earth
was that?!

00:43.961 --> 00:45.755
<i>My name is Jimmy Valmer.</i>

00:48.883 --> 00:52.261
<i>And I am very f-f-fast.</i>

00:52.428 --> 00:54.638
<i>When I was born, my parents
knew I was different.</i>

00:54.805 --> 00:56.682
I'm sorry,
Mr. and Mrs. Valmer.

00:56.849 --> 00:58.976
Your newborn son will never
be able to walk.

00:59.143 --> 01:01.145
But he will be
extremely good at comedy.

01:03.522 --> 01:06.358
Wow! What
a t-t-terrific audience.

01:09.737 --> 01:12.073
<i>As I got older,
my powers only increased.</i>

01:12.239 --> 01:14.533
What do you call cheese
that isn't yours?

01:14.700 --> 01:15.743
Help!

01:19.288 --> 01:20.372
Nacho Cheese.

01:22.083 --> 01:23.501
<i>And now I look
for others like me</i>

01:23.667 --> 01:25.336
to fight crime
as part of a superhero team.

01:25.503 --> 01:26.337
I am...

01:26.504 --> 01:28.923
Fa-Fa-Fastpass.

01:30.508 --> 01:32.718
Okay, okay,
thank you, Fastpass.

01:32.885 --> 01:33.677
I like it.
What do you guys think?

01:33.844 --> 01:35.179
We definitely
don't have anyone

01:35.346 --> 01:36.931
with super-human speed
in our franchise.

01:37.098 --> 01:38.432
Fastpass, what makes you
feel qualified

01:38.599 --> 01:39.975
to be part of
our cinematic universe?

01:40.142 --> 01:42.770
Well, besides
being super f-f-fast,

01:42.937 --> 01:44.313
I also have
a good attitude

01:44.480 --> 01:46.732
and flexibility with my schedule
on weekends.

01:46.899 --> 01:49.777
Fastpass,
welcome to Coon and Friends.

01:49.944 --> 01:52.655
You are about to make
a shit load of money.

02:03.916 --> 02:05.251
All right, superheroes,

02:05.417 --> 02:07.461
it's time to layout
our plan of action.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.004
As you can see, I have divided
the franchise plan

02:09.171 --> 02:10.631
into three phases.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.967
Phase one begins with
"The Coon" Netflix series

02:13.134 --> 02:14.844
and goes through
the "Coon and Friends United,"

02:15.010 --> 02:16.971
movie where we introduce
Tool Shed and the Human Kite.

02:17.138 --> 02:20.015
In phase two,
we do "Coon vs. Fastpass,"

02:20.182 --> 02:22.268
followed by an origin movie
about Mosquito.

02:22.434 --> 02:25.396
Bzzzzzt! Oh, boy!
I get my own origin movie?! Bzzztzt!

02:25.771 --> 02:26.981
That's right.

02:27.148 --> 02:28.149
It's in Phase two
that we will finally introduce

02:28.315 --> 02:30.276
Tupperware,
our black superhero,

02:30.442 --> 02:31.652
like an ace in the hole.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.487
Whoa, whoa. Wait. How come we gotta start off
with a Netflix series?

02:33.654 --> 02:35.406
Can't we just go
right into movies?

02:35.573 --> 02:38.033
Netflix is starving for
new shows right now, Toolshed.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.494
They will literally buy anything
people pitch them.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.329
We need to strike
while the iron is hot.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.790
Later, in phase three, we can
finally get to Civil War,

02:44.957 --> 02:46.667
where we will all --

02:46.834 --> 02:48.043
What is it?!

02:48.210 --> 02:50.087
Incoming Facetime call
from SuperCraig!

02:50.254 --> 02:51.630
On screen!

02:51.797 --> 02:53.424
<i>You guys,
we have a big problem.</i>

02:53.591 --> 02:55.134
What is it, SuperCraig?

02:55.301 --> 02:56.802
<i>Somebody is messing
with our Facebook page.</i>

02:56.969 --> 02:58.304
<i>They're spreading
all these lies</i>

02:58.470 --> 03:00.097
<i>and saying we like,
burn the American flag</i>

03:00.264 --> 03:01.432
<i>and pee in each other's mouths.</i>

03:01.599 --> 03:03.100
Spreading lies how?

03:03.267 --> 03:05.269
<i>Take a look.
Someone is systematically</i>

03:05.436 --> 03:06.604
<i>targeting
our Facebook followers</i>

03:06.770 --> 03:08.439
<i>and feeding them
misinformation.</i>

03:08.606 --> 03:10.691
Who would deliberately
use Facebook

03:10.858 --> 03:12.568
in such
a horribly reckless way?

03:24.705 --> 03:27.750
Butters, you're not looking
at boobies again, are you?

03:27.917 --> 03:31.462
No, Dad,
I'm not looking at boobies.

03:40.804 --> 03:41.639
Butters.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.515
Oh, hey, fellas!

03:43.682 --> 03:44.934
Butters,
are you using Facebook

03:45.100 --> 03:46.227
to fuck with
our superhero franchise?

03:46.393 --> 03:47.519
Umm...

03:47.686 --> 03:48.562
Nope.

03:50.606 --> 03:52.066
Butters.
Butters!

03:52.233 --> 03:53.734
Yes, fellas?

03:53.901 --> 03:55.819
Dude, listen, we don't
have time for this.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.363
Right now,
Netflix is buying

03:57.529 --> 03:59.198
any show
that people pitch them.

03:59.365 --> 04:01.200
We have a real shot
at starting our franchise,

04:01.367 --> 04:03.327
and you are a part
of that franchise plan, okay?

04:03.494 --> 04:05.537
We have movies planned
for the bad guy!

04:05.704 --> 04:07.122
You mean
like "Suicide Squad"?

04:07.289 --> 04:08.249
Yes!

04:08.415 --> 04:10.334
"Suicide Squad"
sucked.

04:10.501 --> 04:11.877
Butters!

04:12.044 --> 04:13.754
Butters, you can't just
make stuff up about us.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.506
People are thinking
it's true.

04:15.673 --> 04:17.675
Look, fellas, you have a right
to be on Facebook,

04:17.841 --> 04:19.301
and I have a right
to be on Facebook.

04:19.468 --> 04:21.345
And sometimes, that's going
to cause a little...

04:21.512 --> 04:22.888
chaos.

04:23.055 --> 04:25.099
Gotta get to class.

04:27.226 --> 04:30.396
Dude.
What a dick!

04:30.562 --> 04:31.981
If we don't find
a way to stop him,

04:32.147 --> 04:34.275
we're never going to make
any money, you guys.

04:39.071 --> 04:40.322
Thanks for coming,
everyone.

04:40.489 --> 04:42.992
I know you are all concerned
as Sarah and I are

04:43.158 --> 04:44.994
about what's happening
to our children.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.621
I just can't believe
that children in our town

04:47.788 --> 04:49.415
are dressing up
in hero costumes

04:49.581 --> 04:51.625
and peeing
in each other's mouths.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.127
And who are these kids?

04:53.294 --> 04:55.629
Does anyone know?
They're wearing capes

04:55.796 --> 04:58.090
and forcing objects into
their own rectal cavities.

04:58.257 --> 04:59.133
Why?

04:59.300 --> 05:01.593
We were shocked to read that
a young African-American boy

05:01.760 --> 05:03.178
is wearing Tupperware

05:03.345 --> 05:05.431
and defecating on girls
while they sleep.

05:05.597 --> 05:07.933
What if those kids are
hanging out with our kids?

05:08.100 --> 05:09.560
You know what I think
the problem is?

05:09.727 --> 05:10.728
Facebook.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.771
Facebook?
How so?

05:12.938 --> 05:14.440
Well, look,
we all know there's

05:14.606 --> 05:16.442
a lot of mixing
of truth and fiction

05:16.608 --> 05:18.068
that's been
on Facebook lately.

05:18.235 --> 05:20.738
And children lack
the cognitive ability

05:20.904 --> 05:23.574
to determine what's true
and what isn't on Facebook.

05:23.741 --> 05:25.200
That's why we now have
young kids

05:25.367 --> 05:27.202
dressing up in costumes,
eating poop,

05:27.369 --> 05:29.413
and having sex
with antelopes in our town.

05:29.580 --> 05:32.249
Maybe we need to get our kids
off of Facebook.

05:32.416 --> 05:33.542
That'll never happen.

05:33.709 --> 05:35.419
You know what I say we do?

05:35.586 --> 05:38.130
Let's invite Mark Zuckerberg
to come and talk to us all

05:38.297 --> 05:40.215
about our concerns
in this community.

05:40.382 --> 05:42.134
Do you really think
he'd come?

05:42.301 --> 05:43.552
Why not give it a try?

05:43.719 --> 05:45.054
Let's invite
Mark Zuckerberg here

05:45.220 --> 05:46.680
and see
what he has to say.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.599
I'm sure he's
a reasonable person.

06:00.235 --> 06:01.737
Who are you?!
What do you want?!

06:01.904 --> 06:04.073
I'm here about the job?

06:04.239 --> 06:07.117
Oh, are you Adam?
Well, come on in!

06:08.369 --> 06:10.329
You're making
a smart career choice, Adam.

06:10.496 --> 06:12.039
You see, what we do here
is utilize Facebook

06:12.206 --> 06:14.917
not only to spread chaos
but to actually profit from it.

06:15.084 --> 06:16.710
You'll find the hours
very reasonable,

06:16.877 --> 06:18.253
and I'm working on getting

06:18.420 --> 06:19.380
full health and dental
for all employees.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.215
Here's your
company uniform.

06:21.382 --> 06:23.425
You see,
what I've done, Adam,

06:23.592 --> 06:25.969
is built a completely
self-sustaining chaos machine --

06:26.136 --> 06:27.888
You look fantastic --

06:28.055 --> 06:30.307
doing nothing more than what
Facebook was designed to do.

06:30.474 --> 06:32.434
I make money from Facebook
for my fake content

06:32.601 --> 06:35.437
in order to pay Facebook
to promote my fake stories.

06:35.604 --> 06:38.065
And thusly,
we're growing bigger every day.

06:38.232 --> 06:40.442
Everyone, can I have
your attention please?

06:40.609 --> 06:42.444
We have
a new agent of chaos.

06:42.611 --> 06:44.530
Please welcome
Adam Borque.

06:46.031 --> 06:48.409
Here you go. You can
take this workstation, Adam.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.119
Just start writing
horrible things about people

06:50.285 --> 06:52.663
and presenting it as reality
on Facebook.

06:52.830 --> 06:55.332
All right! Don't forget
we have a chaos quota, gang!

06:55.541 --> 06:57.876
Let's really
fuck shit up.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.967
All right. Can everyone hear me in the back?

07:05.134 --> 07:06.885
M'kay We're gonna
get started here.

07:07.052 --> 07:08.429
I know you all
have a lot of questions,

07:08.595 --> 07:09.888
so without further ado,

07:10.055 --> 07:12.516
let me introduce
Mark Zuckerberg.

07:12.683 --> 07:14.226
Thanks for coming,
Mr. Zuckerberg.

07:14.393 --> 07:16.061
Thank you.
It is a great honor

07:16.228 --> 07:18.021
to be here
amongst all of you.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.773
For those few
who don't know,

07:19.940 --> 07:21.275
could you tell us
who you are?

07:21.442 --> 07:23.569
I am the founder and chairman
of Facebook.

07:23.735 --> 07:26.530
But I also have a style that is
completely unblockable.

07:26.697 --> 07:28.157
Okay,
we'll let him speak,

07:28.323 --> 07:29.950
and then we'll open the floor
to some questions

07:30.117 --> 07:31.243
if there's time.
Thank you.

07:31.410 --> 07:32.786
Thank you, right.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.205
All right. Everyone here
wants to see my style.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.332
But first what I'll need
is a volunteer.

07:37.499 --> 07:38.792
Yes, you sir?

07:38.959 --> 07:41.086
Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook
has become a tool

07:41.253 --> 07:44.131
for some to disrupt our country
and our community --

07:44.298 --> 07:45.883
You say these things
like they are my fault,

07:46.049 --> 07:47.176
and yet they are not.

07:47.342 --> 07:49.803
Well, you did
create a platform

07:49.970 --> 07:51.221
with a monetary incentive

07:51.388 --> 07:53.182
for people
to spread misinformation.

07:53.348 --> 07:55.684
Now I see you're trying

07:55.851 --> 07:57.311
to use your style over mine.

07:57.478 --> 07:59.688
Now, you try
to block me.

07:59.855 --> 08:03.317
Brzzz! Byeow!

08:03.484 --> 08:06.028
Now you have learned
that you cannot block me, yes?

08:06.195 --> 08:07.529
Yes.
What is your question?

08:07.696 --> 08:09.114
How are we supposed
to keep our kids --

08:09.281 --> 08:10.908
Ba-ba-ba-baaa!
Ztzztzzzt!

08:11.074 --> 08:12.826
Shwa! Ahh!
Pos-brb!

08:21.919 --> 08:22.753
Wilson Aubrey?

08:22.920 --> 08:24.171
Yeah.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.173
It's us, your heroes,
Coon and Friends.

08:26.340 --> 08:27.508
We're, uh...
just wondering

08:27.674 --> 08:29.801
why you stopped following us
on Instagram.

08:29.968 --> 08:32.137
Because you victimize
innocent people

08:32.304 --> 08:33.805
and poop in
little girls' mouths.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.474
That's not true,
Wilson.

08:35.641 --> 08:37.100
We're Coon and Friends,
not Harvey Weinstein.

08:37.267 --> 08:38.810
Facebook says it's true.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.145
But it's not true.

08:40.312 --> 08:41.605
But Facebook
says it's true.

08:41.772 --> 08:43.148
Okay, but it's not true,

08:43.315 --> 08:44.441
and you need to have
your own fucking brain

08:44.608 --> 08:45.567
and decide shit
for yourself!

08:47.361 --> 08:49.154
God damn it!

08:49.321 --> 08:50.781
Let's just face it.

08:50.948 --> 08:51.615
We're never gonna have
a superhero franchise!

08:51.782 --> 08:53.325
It's so unfair!

08:53.492 --> 08:55.619
Come on, fellas.
We can't let Butters win.

08:55.786 --> 08:57.996
Forget it, Fastpass.
The world hates us now.

08:58.163 --> 08:59.414
Yeah, nobody
believes in us.

08:59.581 --> 09:03.210
We believe in each other,
don't we?

09:03.377 --> 09:04.962
Who cares what
everyone else thinks?

09:05.128 --> 09:07.798
I joined this franchise
because I believe

09:07.965 --> 09:09.800
that it can make
a lot of money.

09:09.967 --> 09:11.885
And being a superhero means
you keep believing in that money

09:12.052 --> 09:14.137
no matter how hard
things get.

09:14.304 --> 09:15.973
Fastpass is right.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.016
We've let all this distract us
from what's important.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.643
We just need to get
the Netflix series

09:19.810 --> 09:22.229
and let our superhero franchise
speak for itself.

09:22.396 --> 09:24.231
Coon, everybody hates us.

09:24.398 --> 09:27.067
Maybe so, but we
know who we are.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.820
We are Coon Friends because
we care about each other,

09:29.987 --> 09:31.363
because we have
each other's backs.

09:31.530 --> 09:33.240
And when things
look their darkest,

09:33.407 --> 09:35.242
these heroes
will stand together and re--

09:35.409 --> 09:37.202
Hey, babe,
what's up?

09:52.342 --> 09:54.636
What are you up to?

09:54.803 --> 09:56.680
Nothing. Just fucking
wearing sweet costumes,

09:56.847 --> 09:57.764
talking about fighting evil.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.808
Is that okay?

09:59.975 --> 10:01.310
I just -- I thought we were
meeting at the park.

10:01.476 --> 10:03.437
You didn't
text or anything.

10:03.604 --> 10:06.106
Oh, my God. Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

10:06.273 --> 10:08.233
Sorry!
I won't interrupt.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.237
Because we are
Coon and Friends,

10:12.404 --> 10:13.822
and as long as
we have each other,

10:13.989 --> 10:17.034
we can do anything!

10:20.621 --> 10:23.915
I swear that was the worst
public speaker I've ever seen.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.876
What was
Mark Zuckerberg's point?

10:26.043 --> 10:27.961
I don't even understand
what that was about.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.338
Guess nobody realized

10:29.504 --> 10:30.797
Mark Zuckerberg
was such a penis.

10:31.590 --> 10:32.758
What the hell?!

10:32.924 --> 10:34.092
It's Mark Zuckerberg.

10:34.259 --> 10:35.594
I know who it is!

10:35.761 --> 10:37.262
Excuse me,
what are you doing here?

10:37.429 --> 10:39.556
I was invited here
by people.

10:39.723 --> 10:41.475
We invited you
to come speak

10:41.642 --> 10:43.602
to our community
about our problems!

10:43.769 --> 10:46.855
Ah! I see what you did there.
Trying to block me, right?

10:47.022 --> 10:49.733
I am tired of eating chips.
What else is there?

10:49.900 --> 10:50.859
Hey!

10:51.026 --> 10:52.569
Get out of our fridge.

10:52.736 --> 10:54.780
This puny
refrigerator could not block me.

10:54.946 --> 10:56.448
What makes you think
you can?

10:56.615 --> 10:58.200
Now, you listen here!
I will not --

10:58.367 --> 10:59.326
Bzzt!

10:59.493 --> 11:02.829
Oh! Jrmm!
Pyow! Wha!

11:02.996 --> 11:06.166
You are no match
for my style.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.968
So, where are we headed?
Perhaps we should get some food.

11:17.135 --> 11:19.429
What -- Excuse me,
this is <i>our</i> car.

11:19.596 --> 11:20.972
You call this a car?

11:21.139 --> 11:23.183
It wasn't even remotely able
to block me.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.310
What is this car's style?

11:25.477 --> 11:27.604
Get -- Get out of here,
you -- you penis!

11:27.771 --> 11:30.273
You say I am a penis,

11:30.440 --> 11:31.692
and yet I am not a penis.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.113
Netflix. You're green lit.
Who am I speaking with?

11:36.279 --> 11:38.740
Uh, yes, hello, we have
an idea for a show

11:38.907 --> 11:40.867
that we think would be great
for Netflix.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.494
Okay, great.
Would you like a pilot

11:42.661 --> 11:44.413
or just go straight to
an order of six episodes?

11:44.579 --> 11:46.331
We'd like to go
right into six episodes

11:46.498 --> 11:47.874
with a pickup option
at the end of three.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.459
Got it. Can you start shooting
next month?

11:49.626 --> 11:51.920
Got a show about
transsexual dragons here!

11:52.087 --> 11:53.255
Yes, we're ready to start
right now.

11:53.422 --> 11:55.048
We are very, very excited.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.300
Okay, sounds great.
We'll send you the contracts.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.010
Oh, and, uh,
what's the show about?

11:59.177 --> 12:00.345
It's a stand-alone series

12:00.512 --> 12:02.139
about a superhero
called The Coon

12:02.305 --> 12:04.099
before he joins
Coon and Friends.

12:04.266 --> 12:05.892
Coon and Friends?

12:06.059 --> 12:07.811
You mean the kids
I just read about in the news

12:07.978 --> 12:09.563
who stabbed Jessica Alba?

12:09.730 --> 12:12.232
Look, you didn't -- you didn't
read that on the news.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.859
You read that on Facebook.

12:14.025 --> 12:16.111
Aw, man, here we go.

12:16.278 --> 12:18.321
Yeah uh, dang it,
we've never done this before,

12:18.488 --> 12:20.449
but I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to pass on your show.

12:20.615 --> 12:22.325
Listen to me!

12:22.492 --> 12:24.661
There are falsehoods about us on Facebook
that are not true!

12:24.828 --> 12:26.913
Well, then you should
have those things taken down.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.331
It can't be that hard.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.375
It's a lot harder
than you think!

12:30.542 --> 12:32.669
Look, we'd love
to approve your show,

12:32.836 --> 12:34.838
but you need to get those things
cleared up first, okay?

12:35.005 --> 12:36.673
Thanks for calling.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.717
Netflix. You're green lit.
Who am I speaking with?

12:45.807 --> 12:47.893
What the --
Who are you?

12:48.059 --> 12:50.061
I believe
that's Mark Zuckerberg.

12:50.228 --> 12:51.563
Hey, that's my soup!

12:51.730 --> 12:53.398
So, you are trying
to block me, huh?

12:53.565 --> 12:54.941
That's fine.
What's your style?

12:55.108 --> 12:57.235
I don't have a style!

13:01.531 --> 13:03.867
Hey!
Get out of my bed!

13:04.034 --> 13:05.577
I was invited here.

13:05.744 --> 13:08.580
I am only making use of a bed
for sleeping, yes?

13:08.747 --> 13:10.207
We just wanted you
to come

13:10.373 --> 13:11.374
share your insights
on Facebook!

13:11.541 --> 13:12.584
Shnn!

13:12.751 --> 13:15.629
Oh, my head! My head!
Shaaa!

13:15.796 --> 13:17.881
You should have worked with me
when you had the chance.

13:18.048 --> 13:20.008
Now you lie
over there, dead.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.222
Attention,
employees.

13:25.388 --> 13:28.642
Kelly Shmidt has just written
her 100th fake blog post

13:28.809 --> 13:31.353
that was shared over 1,000 times
on Facebook.

13:31.520 --> 13:32.938
Let's hear it for Kelly!

13:34.689 --> 13:36.358
Don't forget about
those Chaos incentives!

13:36.525 --> 13:38.777
You too can benefit
from pandemonium.

13:41.571 --> 13:43.156
Butters!

13:43.323 --> 13:45.033
Oh, no!
It's Coon and Friends!

13:45.200 --> 13:45.992
Ahh!
Oh, no!

13:46.159 --> 13:47.536
Oh, no!

13:47.702 --> 13:49.037
Calm down, everyone.
Stick to your work.

13:49.204 --> 13:51.164
I will deal
with these trespassers.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.124
We're here
to put an end to you, Chaos!

13:53.291 --> 13:54.960
Yeah! I don't have
butt sex with antelopes,

13:55.126 --> 13:57.003
and Token doesn't poop
in girls' mouths!

13:57.170 --> 13:59.464
It's the 21st century,
gentlemen.

13:59.631 --> 14:01.758
There's nothing illegal
about what I'm doing.

14:01.925 --> 14:05.428
Yeah? Nothing illegal about us
kicking your a-a-ass either.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.138
Actually that <i>is</i> illegal.

14:07.305 --> 14:10.016
And besides, you can't do
anything to me.

14:11.226 --> 14:14.437
Hyah! Syo-yo-yo!

14:15.939 --> 14:18.483
Wah! So, this is
the Coon and Friends

14:18.650 --> 14:20.068
that you have
told me about.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.571
I warn you, my fighting style
is unsurpassed.

14:22.737 --> 14:25.657
Who the S-S-S-Sam Hell
is that?

14:25.824 --> 14:26.992
I think
that's Mark Zuckerberg.

14:27.158 --> 14:28.660
You wanna get
to Butters, right?

14:28.827 --> 14:30.704
You're gonna have
to get through me, huh!

14:30.871 --> 14:33.623
Dude. This kid
is deliberately lying about us

14:33.790 --> 14:35.458
on your platform
for no other reason

14:35.625 --> 14:36.668
than to cause harm.

14:36.835 --> 14:38.169
Why are you
protecting him?

14:38.336 --> 14:42.299
Simple.
He paid me $17.23.

14:42.465 --> 14:43.884
It's the Facebook
safeguard program.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.677
Just $17 monthly
gets you

14:45.844 --> 14:47.304
personal protection
from Mark Zuckerberg.

14:47.470 --> 14:49.139
Come on!
What's your style?

14:55.812 --> 14:58.273
All right. All right.
Everyone calm down.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.400
I can't hear over all you!

15:00.567 --> 15:01.985
You have
to do something!

15:02.152 --> 15:03.445
This guy is going around

15:03.612 --> 15:05.655
acting like everyone's stuff
is his!

15:05.822 --> 15:07.908
I'm sick of getting
out of the shower

15:08.074 --> 15:11.119
to find Mark Zuckerberg
sitting on my toilet!

15:11.286 --> 15:13.538
Zuckerberg ate everything
in our freezer

15:13.705 --> 15:16.041
and then helped himself
to my wife's lubricant!

15:19.044 --> 15:20.670
All right. All right.
Everyone!

15:20.837 --> 15:23.256
I just want
to know one thing.

15:23.423 --> 15:28.053
Who invited him here?

15:28.219 --> 15:31.139
Come on. Who invited
Mark Zuckerberg to town

15:31.306 --> 15:34.476
in the first place?

15:34.643 --> 15:36.436
- We did.
- We did.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.271
Huh? What's that?

15:38.438 --> 15:41.024
We invited Mark Zuckerberg
to town.

15:41.191 --> 15:42.901
Uh-huh.
That's what I thought.

15:43.068 --> 15:45.236
You all brought Mark Zuckerberg
into your lives

15:45.403 --> 15:47.113
and now you want the police
to shoot him.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.740
Please,
you don't understand.

15:48.907 --> 15:50.909
He's --
he's such a penis.

15:51.076 --> 15:53.036
Yeah, and I'm pretty sure his
voice is dubbed

15:53.203 --> 15:55.372
and he does all
his own sound effects...

15:55.538 --> 15:57.916
Well, that doesn't mean
he's done anything illegal.

15:58.083 --> 16:00.919
Now, the police will help deal
with Mark Zuckerberg, but...

16:01.086 --> 16:02.712
we aren't going to shoot him.

16:04.839 --> 16:07.384
I'm sorry,
that's just the way it is.

16:07.550 --> 16:09.886
You all should have thought
harder about this

16:10.053 --> 16:11.930
before letting him
into your lives.

16:17.435 --> 16:20.397
When we all became superheroes,
we took an oath.

16:20.563 --> 16:23.692
That no matter what it took we
would make shit loads of money.

16:23.858 --> 16:26.194
But thanks to Mark Zuckerberg,
right now...

16:26.361 --> 16:27.654
we are a superhero group

16:27.821 --> 16:29.447
that can't even get a show
on Netflix.

16:29.614 --> 16:31.199
Zuckerberg is the key.

16:31.366 --> 16:33.201
He's the only person
who can shut down Facebook.

16:33.368 --> 16:35.036
How are we going to get him
to do that?

16:35.203 --> 16:37.998
We're gonna beat him
at his own game.

16:44.421 --> 16:46.673
We got the west entrance
to town secure.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.591
How you guys doing
out east?

16:48.758 --> 16:50.427
Here he comes.

16:53.471 --> 16:56.016
Okay, Mr. Zuckerberg.
That's gonna have to be it.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.101
Can't let you into town.

16:58.268 --> 17:00.311
So, you think
you can block me?

17:00.478 --> 17:02.605
Look, people
don't want you here okay?

17:02.772 --> 17:04.065
This is a quiet little town
and...

17:04.232 --> 17:05.692
You cannot block me.

17:05.859 --> 17:07.902
There's plenty of other places
you can go, sir.

17:08.069 --> 17:08.945
Can you please just --

17:12.574 --> 17:13.992
Don't --
Don't do that please --

17:17.287 --> 17:19.205
My brain! My brain!
Aah!

17:21.041 --> 17:22.459
He walked through.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.461
Aah! My my car! My car!

17:27.130 --> 17:28.548
Oh, my God!
It's Mark Zuckerberg!

17:31.426 --> 17:32.844
Oh, my God!
How'd he do that?!

17:39.434 --> 17:41.770
What's the matter?
Too f-f-fast for you?

17:41.936 --> 17:44.856
You saw me walk right
through that police barricade,

17:45.023 --> 17:46.357
and yet you think
you can block me, right?

17:46.524 --> 17:47.650
Go ahead and try.

17:51.029 --> 17:53.114
Now Zuckerberg! Let's see you
block my shtoile!

17:53.281 --> 17:54.449
Pew! Pew! Pew!

17:58.244 --> 17:59.829
Wha, da, da, da, da.
Bam!

17:59.996 --> 18:02.373
Oh!

18:03.541 --> 18:05.335
Ow!

18:05.502 --> 18:07.295
I have never witnessed
this style before!

18:07.462 --> 18:09.464
Hey, look!
The freaky costume kids

18:09.631 --> 18:10.924
are getting Zuckerberg!

18:11.091 --> 18:12.258
Get him, kids!

18:12.425 --> 18:13.510
Poop in his mouth!

18:13.676 --> 18:15.595
Aah!

18:20.266 --> 18:22.685
You tried to match my style
and failed!

18:22.852 --> 18:25.188
Oh! It is over!

18:25.355 --> 18:27.357
My friends are all beaten!
Why?!

18:27.524 --> 18:29.317
They were just children.

18:29.484 --> 18:32.028
This one simply protesting
for black lives.

18:32.195 --> 18:34.781
And this child trying to speak
out for handicapped people!

18:34.948 --> 18:36.866
W-Why, Mark Zuckerberg?

18:37.033 --> 18:38.827
And my friend Kyle,

18:38.993 --> 18:40.620
guilty of nothing but standing
up for the rights of Jews.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.831
Wh-wha-what
are you talking about?

18:42.997 --> 18:45.333
Ever heard
of Facebook Live?

18:47.710 --> 18:50.130
We are just kids trying to have
our voices heard for

18:50.296 --> 18:52.465
black, handicapped
and Jewish rights.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.968
Cut down in our prime
by Mark Zuckerberg.

18:55.135 --> 18:57.971
But -- but hold on.
That -- that's not true!

18:58.138 --> 18:59.931
Facebook says it's true.

19:00.098 --> 19:03.685
Nooo!

19:06.146 --> 19:07.147
- Huh?
- What? -Hey!

19:07.313 --> 19:09.023
- What?
- What's going on?!

19:09.190 --> 19:10.400
Everyone keep working!

19:10.567 --> 19:12.360
- We can't.
- Something's wrong

19:12.527 --> 19:14.112
with Facebook.
- It's gone. Like...

19:14.279 --> 19:15.864
somebody shut it down.

19:16.030 --> 19:17.448
What are you talking about?!

19:17.615 --> 19:19.617
It's over, Chaos!

19:19.784 --> 19:21.870
We've forced your little toady
to shut down

19:22.036 --> 19:23.288
his own disorder device.

19:23.454 --> 19:24.789
Curse you, Coon and Friends!

19:24.956 --> 19:25.874
This isn't over!

19:26.040 --> 19:27.584
Oh, yes, it is.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.753
Butters! You're the one
who started all this?!

19:30.920 --> 19:32.755
Uh-oh.

19:36.843 --> 19:39.429
You think
you're just so smart don't you?

19:39.596 --> 19:41.431
No, sir! No, sir, I just--
- Make me look like a fool will you?!

19:41.598 --> 19:42.974
We'll just see about this!

19:45.018 --> 19:46.603
Not so funny now is it?!

19:46.769 --> 19:48.897
Go on!
Tell Mr. Putin what you told me!

19:49.063 --> 19:51.107
Well, I was just --

19:51.274 --> 19:54.402
Well, I just said how I just
used Facebook like Russia did

19:54.569 --> 19:55.653
and really didn't break
any rules --

19:55.820 --> 19:57.655
Didn't break any rules!

19:57.822 --> 20:00.033
Good job teaching our children
that's all that matters!

20:00.200 --> 20:02.202
Just because there's a way to
cause chaos in a town

20:02.368 --> 20:03.828
or disrupt an entire country

20:03.995 --> 20:06.039
doesn't mean you go and do it,
does it?

20:06.206 --> 20:07.957
If Mark Zuckerberg
points a loaded cannon

20:08.124 --> 20:09.709
at someone's face,

20:09.876 --> 20:10.877
are you innocent
for just lighting the fuse?!

20:11.044 --> 20:14.047
Answer me.

20:14.214 --> 20:17.217
No! You don't go around making
up things about people either,

20:17.383 --> 20:18.176
unless it's about
Mark Zuckerberg

20:18.343 --> 20:19.469
'cause he deserves it.

20:19.636 --> 20:22.138
I hope you're both
very satisfied

20:22.305 --> 20:25.683
with the damage you've caused,
because you're both grounded!

20:27.393 --> 20:29.145
Coon Friends, we have done it.

20:29.312 --> 20:32.398
Facebook is gone and Netflix
has approved our TV show.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.150
All we have to do now

20:34.317 --> 20:36.986
is agree on the final draft
of the franchise plan.

20:37.153 --> 20:39.280
You can see that the
SuperCraig movie now precedes

20:39.447 --> 20:40.949
the Coon VS SuperCraig movie

20:41.115 --> 20:43.660
followed by Mysterion's
video game and then --

20:43.826 --> 20:45.119
How come I have to have
the video game?

20:45.286 --> 20:46.162
I wanna movie too.

20:46.329 --> 20:47.956
You have a movie, Mysterion.

20:48.122 --> 20:49.415
You're in the third
Coon and Friends United movie

20:49.582 --> 20:51.125
after your video game.

20:51.292 --> 20:53.461
Yeah, but he's saying he doesn't
ever get his own movie.

20:53.628 --> 20:56.089
- Do I get my own movie?
- Not everyone gets their own movie.

20:56.256 --> 20:59.759
- This franchise plan sucks.
- Oh, Jesus, here we go again.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.386
No,
Wonder Tweek is right.

21:01.552 --> 21:03.137
It was better when we started
the movies off

21:03.304 --> 21:05.556
with the Tupperware prequel.
- Dude, you can't do a prequel first.

21:05.723 --> 21:07.100
- Why not?
- 'Cause then it's not a prequel,

21:07.267 --> 21:08.726
it's just first.

21:08.893 --> 21:10.770
And besides Tupperware
isn't our strongest character.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.814
Fuck you.
It's better than a human kite.

21:12.981 --> 21:15.108
He just likes this plan because
he gets two movies in phase one.

21:15.275 --> 21:16.859
Guys! We have to just
go with this plan.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.278
We don't even have
one movie yet!

21:18.444 --> 21:19.862
<i>You</i> go with the plan.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.155
Maybe we'll just go
and do our own franchise.

21:21.322 --> 21:22.907
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

21:23.074 --> 21:24.575
Oh, you want civil war?!
Is that what you want?!

21:24.742 --> 21:26.619
Yeah, dude. It's civil war.
Fuck you.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.329
Oh, fuck you.
Get outta my house.

21:28.496 --> 21:30.999
We'll make way more money
on our franchise!

21:31.165 --> 21:33.376
Go ahead. I bet you don't even
get halfway through phase one

21:33.543 --> 21:34.502
on your franchise,
DC Comics.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.718
I thought Civil War wasn't
supposed to happen

21:41.884 --> 21:45.054
until phase three.
- Shut up, SuperCraig.
