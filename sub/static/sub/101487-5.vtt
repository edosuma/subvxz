God, can you believe that
Trump hung himself in prison?

00:43.085 --> 00:46.378
I know! And that Chris Christie
lost all that weight.

00:48.740 --> 00:51.091
He still looks terrible, though.

00:52.386 --> 00:53.868
(knocking)

00:55.056 --> 00:57.781
-Oh, hey, Joe.
-Hey, Peter. If you have a sec,

00:57.800 --> 00:59.874
there's something
I want to talk to you about.

00:59.935 --> 01:01.376
<i> PETER:</i>
<i> Oh, boy, this is it.</i>

01:01.479 --> 01:03.287
<i> He wants me to have sex</i>
<i> with Bonnie.</i>

01:03.388 --> 01:05.597
<i> Now, remember, Peter,</i>
<i> you can't say yes right away.</i>

01:05.791 --> 01:07.382
<i> You let him talk you into it.</i>

01:07.485 --> 01:10.736
<i> He's watching for that.</i>
<i> It's part of the dance.</i>

01:10.887 --> 01:12.813
I will absolutely have sex
with Bonnie.

01:12.907 --> 01:15.056
<i> JOE:</i>
<i> Sorry, Peter, you're too eager.</i>

01:15.117 --> 01:16.483
So, I came over to invite you

01:16.577 --> 01:18.577
to Susie's christening
this weekend.

01:18.728 --> 01:21.413
-Oh.
-And I don't just want you
to be a guest.

01:21.606 --> 01:24.324
I was wondering if you'd
be willing to be the godfather.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.585
-Godfather?
-Yeah, you're my best friend,

01:26.736 --> 01:29.904
and, well, I'd like you to be
Susie's godfather, too.

01:29.965 --> 01:32.499
<i> -Godfather II?</i>
-Wow, you're really warming
to this.

01:32.593 --> 01:35.652
Well, you've made
two very compelling arguments.

01:35.671 --> 01:39.014
Perhaps we should discuss this
further in my poorly-lit den.

01:40.384 --> 01:41.916
So, about this offer...

01:41.977 --> 01:43.751
What are you guys discussing?

01:43.813 --> 01:45.587
And when did we get a den?

01:45.648 --> 01:47.497
Sorry, Lois,
half of being a godfather

01:47.516 --> 01:49.257
is closing the door
in your wife's face

01:49.318 --> 01:51.351
while she wonders
what's going on inside.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.487
But I just wanted to...

02:09.171 --> 02:11.446
PETER: I forgot
it was a swinging door.

02:11.465 --> 02:14.424
(bell tolling)

02:16.528 --> 02:19.138
(Italian accent):
DiGiorno. DiGiorno.

02:19.331 --> 02:20.806
Joe Paterno.

02:20.999 --> 02:22.366
DiGiorno.

02:22.426 --> 02:24.368
Damn it, Peter,
being Susie's godfather

02:24.428 --> 02:25.719
doesn't mean you're in the mob.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.737
And you can't bring a cat
to church.

02:27.739 --> 02:30.056
Why not? He's Cat'lic.

02:30.151 --> 02:31.541
(cat snickering)

02:31.643 --> 02:34.060
(giggles)
He does a Muttley laugh.

02:34.155 --> 02:35.654
Where's the priest?

02:35.847 --> 02:38.048
Oh, the church ran out
of priests months ago,

02:38.108 --> 02:39.549
'cause of all the diddlin'.

02:39.610 --> 02:41.735
Now they just have a rabbi
fill in.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.053
Shalom, everyone.

02:43.113 --> 02:44.646
Welcome to the christening.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.223
Now, before the child
goes in the water,

02:46.325 --> 02:48.575
has it been at least 20 minutes
since she ate?

02:48.727 --> 02:50.060
-Yes, Rabbi.
-Wonderful.

02:50.120 --> 02:51.837
Then let's dunk this kid
like a doughnut.

02:52.030 --> 02:54.322
I hereby christen this child
in the name of Jesus Christ,

02:54.383 --> 02:55.841
who was killed
by we-don't-know-who,

02:56.034 --> 02:57.509
it's not important.

02:57.702 --> 02:59.494
The last thing we want to do
is point fingers...

02:59.555 --> 03:01.513
Can you please take my daughter
out of the water?

03:01.706 --> 03:03.240
Sorry.

03:03.300 --> 03:05.166
Congratulations, sweetie,
you're a Christian.

03:05.186 --> 03:07.853
From now on, every Sunday
you get to eat a hard cookie

03:08.046 --> 03:10.230
and pretend it's a guy.

Hey, Stewie.
Still sleeping in the slow lane?

03:40.054 --> 03:42.554
(forced chuckling)
Okay. Okay.

03:42.706 --> 03:44.706

-Actually, yes.

03:47.010 --> 03:49.377
Yeah, me, too.
I don't like the men's room.

Here's looking at you,
actual kid.

04:08.290 --> 04:10.156
Everyone,
I'd like to say a few words.

04:10.309 --> 04:12.066
Uh, it's a very special day,

04:12.127 --> 04:14.327
as we dedicate Susie's life
to Christ

04:14.480 --> 04:16.088
before she can consent to it

04:16.281 --> 04:18.648
or have any conception
of what's happening.

04:18.667 --> 04:21.318
Susie once licked a booger
off my hand.

04:21.378 --> 04:23.487
-I'm Chris, by the way.
-Thanks, Chris,

04:23.505 --> 04:25.171
but let's wait
till we're called upon, bud.

04:25.266 --> 04:27.157
Anyway,
thank you all for coming.

04:27.259 --> 04:28.750
And to the host.

04:28.811 --> 04:30.752
Joe, thank you for having us
in this restaurant

04:30.771 --> 04:33.588
with a painted wall
that makes Venice look terrible.

04:33.691 --> 04:35.515
OTHERS:
To Joe!

04:35.609 --> 04:36.775
Everyone, enjoy.

04:36.968 --> 04:38.668
Uh, for the kids,
we've got games

04:38.729 --> 04:40.779
and also a party princess
dressed as Elsa

04:40.972 --> 04:42.672
who's clearly a prostitute,

04:42.733 --> 04:44.283
but please
don't proposition her here,

04:44.451 --> 04:47.193
just nod in her direction--
trust me, she'll get it.

04:47.346 --> 04:49.121
It's her profession.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.536
Oh, cool, they got a piñata!

04:56.630 --> 04:59.022
-Peter, it's for the kids.
-Like hell it is.

04:59.082 --> 05:00.948
I'm the godfather of this event,

05:01.010 --> 05:04.136
and I want a debilitating
wine-and-candy headache.

05:04.329 --> 05:06.138
Give me that, kid.

05:06.331 --> 05:08.307
I'm your son, you dick.

05:08.458 --> 05:10.142
Sir, please,
you're making a scene.

05:10.335 --> 05:12.144
No, I'm not.
I can do whatever I want.

05:12.337 --> 05:13.812
I'm the godfather.

05:15.006 --> 05:16.389
Uh-oh.

05:27.110 --> 05:30.053
-Godfather?
-There's a new godfather?
-Aw, look at the wall.

05:30.113 --> 05:32.906
Why does Venice
always look-a so terrible?

05:33.058 --> 05:35.241
From now on,
you eat on the house.

05:35.336 --> 05:39.504
You will be treated with
the utmost respect, Godfather.

05:39.697 --> 05:43.583
<i> Grazie.</i> Now please name the
menu item I ordered after me.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.251
The dinosaur chicken tenders?

05:45.387 --> 05:46.845
All right,
we'll find something else.

05:47.038 --> 05:48.513
Thank you very much.

05:48.665 --> 05:51.074
Hear that, Doug?
My dad's now the godfather.

05:51.134 --> 05:52.684
And yours is...

05:52.836 --> 05:55.687
VP of Systems Integration
or something?

05:55.880 --> 05:57.522
What was that, Stewie?

05:57.674 --> 05:59.416
I was invited to sit
at the first grade table.

05:59.518 --> 06:01.342
What?!
How'd you get that invite?

06:01.403 --> 06:02.861
Big D energy, Stewie.

06:03.054 --> 06:05.346
You either got it or you don't.

06:05.366 --> 06:07.215
Oh, yeah?
What does the "D" stand for?

06:07.284 --> 06:09.368
-Divorced?
-(others gasp)

06:09.519 --> 06:12.353
-Wh-What?!
-Stewie, my parents are trying
to make it work.

06:12.456 --> 06:14.598
-Gee, Stewie.
-They're doing their best.

06:14.658 --> 06:16.600
He ended things with the nanny.

06:16.660 --> 06:18.768
Not that it's any
of<i> your</i> business.

06:18.829 --> 06:22.047
Oh, yeah.
Uh, g-g-g-good for them.

06:22.198 --> 06:24.107
Gene and Sheryl
are wonderful people.

06:24.167 --> 06:26.776
I-I hope they make it work.
Good vibes. Healing.

06:26.837 --> 06:30.597
G-G-G-God bless you all.

06:38.014 --> 06:40.399
God, I can't believe Mike Pence
came out of the closet

06:40.550 --> 06:43.318
just before he hung himself
in prison.

06:46.189 --> 06:48.890
-Bon Jovi, family.
-Morning, Dad.

06:48.951 --> 06:51.243
Are things gonna change
now that you're a godfather?

06:51.436 --> 06:53.561
Good question, Chris.
And yes, quite a bit.

06:53.622 --> 06:56.473
I'll be touching faces
a lot more than I used to.

06:56.533 --> 06:59.976
My boys. My bambinos.

06:59.995 --> 07:01.569
No touch.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.905
And I'll be totally oblivious
to the affair

07:03.966 --> 07:05.924
between my bodyguard
and my wife.

07:06.117 --> 07:08.760
You look very nice today,
Vincenzo.

07:08.953 --> 07:10.762
Hey! She gave you a compliment.

07:10.955 --> 07:13.247
What, do you got cotton
in your ears? Answer her.

07:13.267 --> 07:15.659
Yeah, meathead.
What's with this guy, Pop?

07:15.719 --> 07:18.344
And as a mafioso,
I'll be doing more voice-overs,

07:18.439 --> 07:22.015
which will always begin
by naming everyone at the event.

07:22.167 --> 07:23.925
-What does that even mean?
<i> -PETER: There we were</i>
<i> at breakfast.</i>

<i> you put on your boxers</i>
<i> the wrong way</i>

07:38.241 --> 07:41.776
-We're out of syrup.
-I'll get it. You stay here.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.778
And will you be
a stricter dad now?

07:43.839 --> 07:45.705
Interesting question.
My value system

07:45.857 --> 07:48.541
will vary wildly
between incredible immorality

07:48.635 --> 07:50.710
and intense social conservatism.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.004
Dad, there's a shipment
of heroin in our driveway.

07:53.198 --> 07:56.216
-Excellent.
-I watched a PG-13 movie
last night.

07:56.310 --> 07:58.459

07:58.479 --> 08:00.704
Now, everyone keep eating
until you throw up.

08:00.764 --> 08:03.223
What's this? As a leader
in the Italian community,

08:03.317 --> 08:07.043
I'll be getting very upset
about store-bought pasta sauce.

08:07.103 --> 08:08.636
Peter, what the hell?

08:08.697 --> 08:10.489
That was our Prego.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.824
Yeah, and<i> prego</i> means
"you're welcome."

08:13.017 --> 08:15.827
It's a very cocky name
for an average pasta sauce.

08:16.020 --> 08:18.663
The rest of this is just jokes,
but that's kind of a good point.

08:18.856 --> 08:20.557
Now, kids,
before you go to school,

08:20.659 --> 08:22.834
let's discuss what you tell
your friends about me.

08:23.027 --> 08:24.819
That your fingernails
are so filthy

08:24.880 --> 08:26.838
because you do scratchers
all day?

08:26.990 --> 08:28.398
Never talk
about the family business!

08:28.458 --> 08:30.083
Things are too hot here
for you now.

08:30.235 --> 08:32.010
You need to go to Italy
for five years.

08:32.203 --> 08:34.087
-What?!
-You're not safe here anymore,

08:34.239 --> 08:36.515

all the murderers are from.
