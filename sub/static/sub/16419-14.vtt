00:10.896 --> 00:12.999
- 'Kay.
Can you guys hear me?

00:13.000 --> 00:14.309
- Yup! Loud and clear.
- Yeah we can.

00:14.310 --> 00:17.516
- Okay. Great.
So, did you get

00:17.517 --> 00:19.964
all the lovely Clam Jumper food
we sent over to you?

00:19.965 --> 00:21.447
- Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:21.448 --> 00:22.793
- We did.
Here, we'll show you.

00:27.896 --> 00:29.792
- Hudson!
- Dude!

00:29.793 --> 00:31.205
- What's up?

00:31.206 --> 00:33.343
- What are you doing
to those Clamburgers?

00:33.344 --> 00:35.655
- Just licking the clam sauce
off of the buns.

00:37.413 --> 00:39.102
- Um, is something wrong
with that boy?

00:39.103 --> 00:42.517
- Oh! No, no, no, no..
- Yeah there is.

00:44.344 --> 00:45.999
- Hey, if you
have to lick the buns,

00:46.000 --> 00:47.516
go do it outside.

00:47.517 --> 00:48.689
- Deal!

00:52.137 --> 00:53.550
- Anyway...

00:53.551 --> 00:55.861
why'd you awesome
people at Clam Jumper

00:55.862 --> 00:57.240
send us all this food?

00:57.241 --> 00:59.895
- Well, see, our boss,
Jerry Stone,

00:59.896 --> 01:01.895
he's a huge fan of Game Shakers!

01:01.896 --> 01:03.343
- Oh that's so nice!
- He is?

01:03.344 --> 01:05.240
- Yeah, he especially
loves your new game.

01:05.241 --> 01:06.550
The one with the llama
who spits.

01:06.551 --> 01:08.757
- You mean
Llama Llama Spit Spit.

01:08.758 --> 01:09.930
- That's the one.

01:09.931 --> 01:12.136
- Heeheeheehee!
- Hush...

01:12.137 --> 01:14.688
So we were thinking
that maybe you Game Shakers

01:14.689 --> 01:17.033
might wanna partner
with us at Clam Jumper,

01:17.034 --> 01:18.654
to promote your game.

01:18.655 --> 01:21.378
- Really?!?
That would be awesome.

01:21.379 --> 01:23.103
- Wait.
What's in it for you?

01:25.103 --> 01:27.171
- To tell you
what's in it for us,

01:27.172 --> 01:30.550
here's our head clam...
Jerry Stone.

01:30.551 --> 01:31.551
- Hiya Game Shakers.

01:31.552 --> 01:33.895
- Heyyyy.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

01:33.896 --> 01:35.102
- Where's Double G?

01:35.103 --> 01:36.378
Wha... I want to meet Double G.

01:36.379 --> 01:37.895
Wait. Is Double G there?

01:37.896 --> 01:40.137
- No... Thank God.

01:41.517 --> 01:43.205
- See, Double G
is our business partner,

01:43.206 --> 01:44.274
but he's not here all the time.

01:44.275 --> 01:45.792
- Yeah, we never really know

01:45.793 --> 01:47.516
when he's gonna pop up.

01:47.517 --> 01:49.412
- Kinda like a cold sore, right?

01:51.793 --> 01:53.585
- Babe.
- Hmmm, what?

01:53.586 --> 01:55.481
- She has a cold sore.

01:55.482 --> 01:57.067
- Oh... Oh no!

01:57.068 --> 01:59.274
I-I-I wasn't making fun
of your cold sore...

01:59.275 --> 02:02.274
- Yeah ye-ye-yeah,
we didn't even notice it...

02:02.275 --> 02:05.033
right there on your lip.

02:05.034 --> 02:06.964
- So, Game Shakers...

02:06.965 --> 02:08.516
You know, we're
opening a brand new

02:08.517 --> 02:12.033
Clam Jumper Restaurant
in Midtown Manhattan.

02:12.034 --> 02:15.619
And I'm looking to spend
about 10 million

02:15.620 --> 02:18.033
on some clever way to
promote our grand opening!

02:18.034 --> 02:22.205
- Wow... 10 million...

02:22.206 --> 02:24.274
- Whoa!
That's a lot of clams!

02:24.275 --> 02:25.654
- No.
No no no.

02:25.655 --> 02:27.172
That's not the kind
of jokes we make.

02:28.965 --> 02:31.378
- Yeah so, we're
thinking that maybe

02:31.379 --> 02:34.757
we could help you Game Shakers
promote your new game...

02:34.758 --> 02:36.412
- Llama Llama Spit Spit...

02:36.413 --> 02:37.619
- Yeah, and you could help us

02:37.620 --> 02:39.274
promote our new
Clam Jumper Restaurant.

02:39.275 --> 02:41.654
- Oh yeah! I like that.
- Oh! Right. That makes sense.

02:41.655 --> 02:45.171
- Hey! Why don't we all
have a face-to-face meeting?

02:45.172 --> 02:47.930
- Good call!
How about dinner with us

02:47.931 --> 02:49.274
at our new
Clam Jumper Restaurant,

02:49.275 --> 02:50.447
tomorrow night?

02:50.448 --> 02:51.757
- Oh!

02:51.758 --> 02:53.343
Well we'd love to see
the new restaurant.

02:53.344 --> 02:56.171
- Fantastic!
- I'll text you the details.

02:56.172 --> 02:57.343
- Oooohohoho!!!

02:57.344 --> 02:58.895
- Cool!
Looking forward to it.

02:58.896 --> 03:00.964
- Bye!
- Goodbye Game Shakers!

03:00.965 --> 03:03.205
- Do you realize
how big this is?

03:03.206 --> 03:05.412
- What?
Her cold sore?

03:05.413 --> 03:07.619
- No, this deal we might
make with Clam Jumper!

03:07.620 --> 03:09.550
- Oh! I know!
It could be really good

03:09.551 --> 03:12.136
for our business and theirs.
And I'm really excited to see...

03:12.137 --> 03:13.516
- What's up everybody?
- Trip, guess what!

03:13.517 --> 03:15.136
We just got a call from this...

03:15.137 --> 03:17.067
- What the... is that food
from Clam Jumper?!?

03:17.068 --> 03:19.757
Oh! Oh!
It's so good!

03:19.758 --> 03:21.620
- Dad, no!

03:23.206 --> 03:25.343
No! No!
Put it down!

03:25.344 --> 03:26.585
You gotta control yourself!

03:26.586 --> 03:28.654
It's bad for ya!
It's baaaad!

03:28.655 --> 03:30.171
Bunny!
Ruthless!

03:30.172 --> 03:31.792
Bunny! Ruthless!

03:31.793 --> 03:33.240
- Ahhh!

03:33.241 --> 03:34.241
- What's goin' on?!?

03:34.242 --> 03:35.826
- It's Clam Jumper food.

03:35.827 --> 03:37.309
He's tryin' to get it!

03:37.310 --> 03:38.999
- Dub, quit it!
- No Dub, no!

03:39.000 --> 03:41.205
- It's so good!
It's so good!

03:41.206 --> 03:42.896
Ow! Ow!

03:43.931 --> 03:46.482
Ahhhh!

03:49.793 --> 03:51.930
- There.
He's calm now.

03:51.931 --> 03:53.275
- Do me next!

03:54.896 --> 03:56.378
- Wha-no!

03:56.379 --> 03:57.757
Just please, take my dad
out to the lobby

03:57.758 --> 03:58.861
for a few minutes.

03:58.862 --> 04:00.724
- Okay.
- Will do!

04:02.068 --> 04:04.550
- Come on Dub!
- Clamburger...

04:04.551 --> 04:06.412
I need it...
please...

04:06.413 --> 04:07.895
oh magical meat...

04:07.896 --> 04:11.862
IT'S ALL ABOUT
YOUR WARM SOFT BUUNNNNSSS...

04:16.482 --> 04:18.654
- Have you all gone crazy?!?

04:18.655 --> 04:21.861
- Okay, here's what I love
about your question.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.688
We were here... working.

04:23.689 --> 04:26.412
When you show up with your dad,

04:26.413 --> 04:28.619
who sees our food, screams,

04:28.620 --> 04:30.274
starts shoving it in his face,

04:30.275 --> 04:32.033
then you attack him,
call in two gigantic men,

04:32.034 --> 04:35.412
who run in here and zap him
until he loses consciousness,

04:35.413 --> 04:39.102
and then you and ask us
if WE'VE gone crazy.

04:39.103 --> 04:41.378
- But you guys know
my dad has...

04:41.379 --> 04:42.688
a problem.

04:42.689 --> 04:44.757
- Which problem are
you talking about?

04:44.758 --> 04:46.619
- Your dad's got
a lotta problems.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.136
- I'm talkin' about
his problem with food

04:49.137 --> 04:50.240
from the Clam Jumper.

04:50.241 --> 04:51.826
He loves it too much.

04:51.827 --> 04:53.378
- So? Who cares?

04:53.379 --> 04:55.412
- Eating a little too much food
from The Clam Jumper

04:55.413 --> 04:56.861
isn't that big a deal.

04:56.862 --> 04:59.240
- It's not?
Okay...

04:59.241 --> 05:00.481
- I got a video here

05:00.482 --> 05:02.447
that I think you guys
need to see.

05:02.448 --> 05:04.723
- Oh, please let it be
a monkey giving a cat a bath.

05:04.724 --> 05:07.757
- This video is of my dad,
right after the first time

05:07.758 --> 05:10.205
he tried to quit
the Clam Jumper.

05:10.206 --> 05:15.757
- Mmmm...
oh Clamburger...

05:15.758 --> 05:17.309
- Dad...
- Huh?

05:17.310 --> 05:19.067
- Dad, look at you.

05:19.068 --> 05:20.723
You're sittin' on the floor,
eatin' a Clamburger.

05:20.724 --> 05:25.585
- Uh this is...
this is a mess.

05:25.586 --> 05:27.619
- You said you were gonna quit.

05:27.620 --> 05:30.343
- I can't quit The Clam Burger!

05:30.344 --> 05:32.482
It's so good!

05:36.206 --> 05:38.723
- Oh my God.

05:38.724 --> 05:40.757
- Well, he was doin' great.

05:40.758 --> 05:42.861
He hadn't touched any
Clam Jumper food in two weeks.

05:42.862 --> 05:45.654
Ulch... I mean,
who brought all this in here?

05:45.655 --> 05:47.067
- The Clam Jumper
people sent it over.

05:47.068 --> 05:49.447
- They wanna do a huge deal
with Game Shakers.

05:49.448 --> 05:51.240
- Well that's cool but, I mean,

05:51.241 --> 05:52.654
we just gotta
watch out for my dad

05:52.655 --> 05:54.550
to make sure he doesn't
eat any more Clam Jump...

05:54.551 --> 05:56.516
- Where'd Dub go!?!
- We've lost Dub!!!

05:56.517 --> 05:59.517
- Oh, my...
- Where could he be?

06:02.517 --> 06:05.412
- There he is!!!

06:05.413 --> 06:07.378
- He's got Clam Jumper food!!!

06:07.379 --> 06:09.378
- Get him!

06:09.379 --> 06:13.240

Llama Llama Spit Spit!

07:11.586 --> 07:16.102
- Well, thanks thanks much much.
- Oh no...

07:16.103 --> 07:18.585
- So, how do you ladies feel
about a partnership

07:18.586 --> 07:20.171
between Game Shakers
and Clam Jumper?

07:20.172 --> 07:22.895
- It could be a great way
to bring attention to your game

07:22.896 --> 07:26.067
and to the grand opening
of our new location here.

07:26.068 --> 07:28.067
- Oh yeah, Kenzie and I
are totally into it.

07:28.068 --> 07:29.516
- So into it.

07:29.517 --> 07:30.654
- And actually...
if you wanna hear

07:30.655 --> 07:31.895
a really cool idea we had...

07:31.896 --> 07:33.171
- Oh we do.
- Yes, yes.

07:33.172 --> 07:36.240
- Um... we were
thinking that we could

07:36.241 --> 07:38.826
add your Clamburger
character to our game,

07:38.827 --> 07:40.240
Llama Llama Spit Spit...

07:40.241 --> 07:41.826
- I love it.
- Woooo!

07:41.827 --> 07:43.792
- And then, on your
grand opening night,

07:43.793 --> 07:47.378
we live-stream the game
right to that billboard.

07:47.379 --> 07:49.379
- Right to that billboard!

07:52.620 --> 07:53.861
- What's wrong?

07:53.862 --> 07:56.343
- We hate that billboard.

07:56.344 --> 07:57.619
- Why, what's wrong with it?

07:57.620 --> 07:59.516
- Well, this is a restaurant.

07:59.517 --> 08:01.171
- And when our customers
are eating,

08:01.172 --> 08:02.930
we don't want them looking
across the street

08:02.931 --> 08:06.585
at an advertisement for diapers.

08:06.586 --> 08:09.550
- Diapers for overweight babies.

08:09.551 --> 08:11.274
- Uhh...
- Yeah...

08:11.275 --> 08:13.688
- Yeah, that's not
a great situation.

08:13.689 --> 08:15.343
- You know we tried to rent it,

08:15.344 --> 08:17.964
but the owner refused
to make a deal with us.

08:17.965 --> 08:21.136
- Well, Babe's like
the best deal-maker ever.

08:21.137 --> 08:22.481
- Ohhh stop.

08:22.482 --> 08:23.895
But yeah.
- Mmhm.

08:23.896 --> 08:25.930
- Well if you're a good
enough deal maker

08:25.931 --> 08:27.688
to get us that billboard,

08:27.689 --> 08:28.861
then we absolutely have a deal.

08:28.862 --> 08:31.000
- Then we absolutely
have a deal.

08:33.896 --> 08:36.240
- Otto please calm down.

08:36.241 --> 08:38.999
Oh, Pam, why'd you put
a bandage on your cold sore?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.688
- Jerry, please don't
talk about my cold sore.

08:41.689 --> 08:45.205
- There!
Now it can breathe!

08:45.206 --> 08:46.585
Will one of you throw
this away for me?

08:46.586 --> 08:49.000
- Kenzie.
- Uh but I...

08:50.551 --> 08:52.965
Aw it's damp!

09:00.931 --> 09:02.654
- He's here!
- Who's here?

09:02.655 --> 09:04.309
- The guy who owns
the billboard!

09:04.310 --> 09:05.412
- Mister Skaggs?!?

09:05.413 --> 09:07.171
- Yeah! I just saw him
get out of a limo,

09:07.172 --> 09:08.516
and he stopped to buy a pretzel!

09:08.517 --> 09:10.895
- Aw geez, he's early!

09:10.896 --> 09:12.481
- Yeah, but I'm...
I think we're cool...

09:12.482 --> 09:14.757
Everything looks all...

09:14.758 --> 09:17.550
Hudson, Hudson...
What is that?

09:17.551 --> 09:20.826
- This is Fruit Man.
I created him.

09:20.827 --> 09:23.895
- What? I... Why?

09:23.896 --> 09:27.206
- 'Cuz! You can't just buy
a man made of fruit!

09:28.862 --> 09:31.516
- No! No no no no...
You're not listening.

09:31.517 --> 09:33.964
I just bought a twisty biscuit,

09:33.965 --> 09:36.103
but there's not
enough salt on it.

09:37.482 --> 09:39.999
No! I hate it!

09:40.000 --> 09:42.481
- Um, hi Mr. Skaggs.

09:42.482 --> 09:44.481
- Look, I best hang up.

09:44.482 --> 09:46.172
Children are looking at me.

09:48.103 --> 09:50.688
- All right! I'm here
to meet whoever's in charge

09:50.689 --> 09:53.240
of, uh, Game Shavers.

09:53.241 --> 09:54.964
- Uh, Game Shakers.

09:54.965 --> 09:56.619
- Yeah, I'm Babe Carano
and this is Kenzie Bell.

09:56.620 --> 09:58.343
- Look...

09:58.344 --> 10:00.757
I'm sure you're both
very nice little girls,

10:00.758 --> 10:05.412
but I'm not here to buy
any of your cookies.

10:05.413 --> 10:06.792
- Uh.
- Our cookies?

10:06.793 --> 10:08.792
- Please just toddle off

10:08.793 --> 10:13.275
and go and find whoever
is in charge.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.964
- All right, sir,

10:21.965 --> 10:24.792
we're the bosses here, m'kay?

10:24.793 --> 10:26.481
And we wanna talk
with you about renting

10:26.482 --> 10:27.792
your billboard in midtown.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.240
- The one across from

10:29.241 --> 10:30.447
the brand new
Clam Jumper restaurant.

10:30.448 --> 10:32.447
- Hahahahaha!

10:32.448 --> 10:33.861
No chance, unh-uh,

10:33.862 --> 10:36.793
not a prayer, not happening.

10:38.862 --> 10:41.585
- So, you'll think about it?

10:41.586 --> 10:44.688
- Do you know how much money
I get paid every month

10:44.689 --> 10:45.861
by the Heavy Doodie
Diaper Company

10:45.862 --> 10:47.136
that rents that billboard?

10:47.137 --> 10:49.516
- But we just wanted it
for one night.

10:49.517 --> 10:51.447
- See, we're doing a
cross-promotion with Clam Ju...

10:51.448 --> 10:54.171
What happened?

10:54.172 --> 10:57.723
- His fingernail
flew into my mouth!

10:57.724 --> 11:01.103
- Spit it out!
- I'm trying!

11:02.068 --> 11:05.274
- This meeting is over.

11:05.275 --> 11:09.551
- Uh! What?!?
- I swallowed it.

11:11.931 --> 11:14.723
- Well... while you're
digesting his fingernail...

11:14.724 --> 11:16.102
I'll just be
over here freaking out

11:16.103 --> 11:17.826
'cuz we just lost
a 10 million dollar deal

11:17.827 --> 11:19.136
'cuz we can't get
that stupid billboard!

11:19.137 --> 11:21.481
- AHHHHNNNNNN!!!
- GEEZ!!!!

11:21.482 --> 11:22.999
- What if...

11:23.000 --> 11:25.240
What if we hack his billboard?

11:25.241 --> 11:28.481
- Wh... do you seriously
think you could do that?

11:28.482 --> 11:29.862
- I'm all over it.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.930
- You're eating your Fruit Man?

11:35.931 --> 11:38.482
- It's okay...
he was an organ donor.

11:40.310 --> 11:42.896
He would've wanted it this way.

11:53.413 --> 11:57.654
- Yeeeaahhh...
oh yeah.

11:57.655 --> 12:00.000
- And now I do this...

12:04.482 --> 12:05.757
Come on girl!
Show it to me!

12:05.758 --> 12:07.137
Show it to me!

12:08.896 --> 12:11.033
Hot mustard, it works!

12:11.034 --> 12:12.309
Hudson!!!
C'mere, c'mere, c'mere!

12:12.310 --> 12:13.723
Come look at what I did!

12:13.724 --> 12:16.240
- Uh, if you want me
to respect your work,

12:16.241 --> 12:20.895
shouldn't you respect mine?
Mmmm?

12:20.896 --> 12:22.896
- Ulch, yes she's beautiful.
Now come on!

12:26.275 --> 12:29.343
'Kay, you see that image
on my computer screen?

12:29.344 --> 12:31.103
- Mhm.
- Now watch...

12:33.724 --> 12:35.274
- See?!?
All I have to do

12:35.275 --> 12:37.585
is get this thing really close
to the billboard,

12:37.586 --> 12:38.964
and then I can sync to it,

12:38.965 --> 12:40.930
and make whatever I want
appear on the billboard!

12:40.931 --> 12:44.688
- Since I'm creating
a Vegetable Woman...

12:44.689 --> 12:46.895
What do you think about me
using these two radishes as...

12:46.896 --> 12:49.067
- No, don't say it out loud.

12:49.068 --> 12:51.274
- Wait...

12:51.275 --> 12:53.412
How are you gonna get that
thing near the billboard?

12:53.413 --> 12:55.895
- That's why Babe went
to go see Bobby Dong.

12:55.896 --> 12:59.964
- ♪ MMMM-BOBBY DONNNNNNG

12:59.965 --> 13:02.447
- Aanyways, Bobby's
gonna give her a launcher

13:02.448 --> 13:04.619
that can shoot this
over to the billboard

13:04.620 --> 13:06.102
from the Clam Jumper patio.

13:06.103 --> 13:08.136
- Hey...

13:08.137 --> 13:11.274
If a Fruit Man and
a Vegetable Woman have a baby,

13:11.275 --> 13:13.931
would the baby be called
a Fregetable?

13:16.275 --> 13:18.274
- Hey. Has anyone
seen my Pear Pad?

13:18.275 --> 13:20.964
I can't find my Pear Pad!
I gotta find my Pear Pad!

13:20.965 --> 13:24.067
- Ulch.
So much drama!

13:24.068 --> 13:26.033
- I'm not seeing it.

13:26.034 --> 13:27.619
- Just keep lookin'!

13:27.620 --> 13:30.136
- Okay. What's so important
about your Pear Pad?

13:30.137 --> 13:32.826
- That video of my dad
was on it!

13:32.827 --> 13:34.378
- Ya mean the one where
he was on the floor,

13:34.379 --> 13:35.757
eating a Clamburger?

13:35.758 --> 13:37.757
- Yeah! And I need
to show him that video

13:37.758 --> 13:39.378
every couple a'days
to help him remember

13:39.379 --> 13:41.344
why he's gotta quit
eatin' that stuff!

13:42.896 --> 13:45.171
Hey... you had your
Pear Pad at Fooders.

13:45.172 --> 13:48.792
- No I didn't...
You're right, I-I did!

13:48.793 --> 13:51.102
Let's go see if it's there.

13:51.103 --> 13:53.619
- 'Kay kay!
Come on vegetable woman!

13:53.620 --> 13:55.723
- Wait wait wait...

13:55.724 --> 13:57.862
Don't bring that
ugly thing you made.

14:01.379 --> 14:03.171
- No! No no no
bring it, bring it!

14:03.172 --> 14:04.585
She's beautiful, c'mon bring it.

14:04.586 --> 14:05.965
Let's go.

14:18.758 --> 14:20.447
- Hey man! Hey!
Mister waiter!

14:20.448 --> 14:22.171
- I have a name.

14:22.172 --> 14:25.481
- Cool.
Listen, I lost somethin'

14:25.482 --> 14:26.826
and I think I might've
left it here!

14:26.827 --> 14:29.206
- Just a moment.

14:33.689 --> 14:35.757
- Please describe
the item you lost.

14:35.758 --> 14:37.688
- It was a Pear Pad.

14:37.689 --> 14:39.619
- All right,
slow down all right,

14:39.620 --> 14:41.033
just gimme a minute.

14:41.034 --> 14:42.413
- I said one thing.

14:46.344 --> 14:50.447
- Hey.
Are you guys hipsters?

14:50.448 --> 14:53.757
- Uh, we don't
really like that term.

14:53.758 --> 14:55.240
- Just leave us alone.

14:55.241 --> 14:56.861
- Yeah, we're trying
to drink our kombucha.

14:56.862 --> 14:59.274
- And eat this avocado toast.

14:59.275 --> 15:00.999
- Oh...

15:01.000 --> 15:03.930
- Okay...

15:03.931 --> 15:06.965
did your lost item
look anything like this?

15:09.620 --> 15:10.999
- What?!? No!

15:11.000 --> 15:14.412
That looks like me,
flyin' a tiny airplane!

15:14.413 --> 15:15.895
- Thank you.

15:15.896 --> 15:18.757
- C'mon, don't you have
a lost and found?

15:18.758 --> 15:20.172
- Sure. Follow me.

15:21.896 --> 15:24.689
- Hey, why do you
have this hair knob?

15:31.931 --> 15:34.034
- Hmm... Got a set
of chattering teeth...

15:37.931 --> 15:40.172
a bra that lights up...

15:42.896 --> 15:47.655
And uh...
a book on prop humor...

15:50.068 --> 15:52.481
- No!
I lost a Pear Pad!

15:52.482 --> 15:54.654
And it's got a really
important video on it!

15:54.655 --> 15:55.688
- Ooo, a video?

15:55.689 --> 15:57.309
- Yeah! Of my Dad!

15:57.310 --> 15:59.240
It's very personal
and I gotta get it back!

15:59.241 --> 16:00.378
- Hey...

16:00.379 --> 16:03.930
Is that a woman
made of vegetables?

16:03.931 --> 16:06.067
- Sure is.

16:06.068 --> 16:08.688
- Cool, can I draw you two?

16:08.689 --> 16:10.413
- Please!

16:18.034 --> 16:19.723
- Hi Bunny, what's up?

16:19.724 --> 16:22.757
- We need that sad video of
Dub eatin' that Clamburger.

16:22.758 --> 16:25.171
- Why, what's wrong?
- Look.

16:25.172 --> 16:26.585
- Ahh I need some!

16:26.586 --> 16:27.895
Get off of me!
- No!

16:27.896 --> 16:29.274
- I need a Clamburger!
Get off of me.

16:29.275 --> 16:31.757
- Respectfully,
I must disobey that order!

16:31.758 --> 16:33.240
- Ahhhh!!!

16:33.241 --> 16:35.241
- Dub bit my wrist!!!

16:40.724 --> 16:43.723
- Oh my God, I love it!

16:43.724 --> 16:46.000
Look at us!

16:48.517 --> 16:50.516
You can't love
a vegetable woman!

16:50.517 --> 16:52.103
Let's go!

16:56.620 --> 16:58.688
- And see, we added a new
character to our game.

16:58.689 --> 17:01.240
- And we think you
might recognize him...

17:01.241 --> 17:02.655
right here...

17:04.551 --> 17:06.171
- Oh my God,
it's the Clamburglar!

17:06.172 --> 17:07.723
- Ahhh!
- Yep.

17:07.724 --> 17:09.516
See, as you're playing,
every once in a while,

17:09.517 --> 17:12.412
the Clamburglar just shows up
and steals your power-ups.

17:12.413 --> 17:13.619
- You don't know when
it's gonna happen.

17:13.620 --> 17:15.102
It just appears.

17:15.103 --> 17:16.757
- Ah.
- Like Pam's cold sore.

17:16.758 --> 17:19.205
- Yes.
- Exactly.

17:19.206 --> 17:21.826
- Now, tell us about
the billboard across the street.

17:21.827 --> 17:23.861
- Right, um.
- Well...

17:23.862 --> 17:25.205
we did meet with Mister Skaggs,

17:25.206 --> 17:26.585
the guy who owns the billboard.

17:26.586 --> 17:28.378
- And did he say
he'd rent it to you

17:28.379 --> 17:30.412
for the night
of our grand opening?

17:30.413 --> 17:33.792
- Well, let's just say...
it's gonna happen.

17:33.793 --> 17:36.274
- Seriously?
- Oh yeah.

17:36.275 --> 17:37.516
- The night of this
grand opening here...

17:37.517 --> 17:39.378
that giant baby
is gonna be replaced

17:39.379 --> 17:42.343
with a live-stream of our game,
Llama Llama Spit Spit...

17:42.344 --> 17:44.412
- And your delicious food.

17:44.413 --> 17:46.482
- Boom!
- Oh! No way!

17:50.724 --> 17:52.551
- Um, excuse me one sec.

17:53.655 --> 17:55.723
- All right.
So, our idea is that...

17:55.724 --> 17:57.171
- Hey, where've you been?

17:57.172 --> 17:58.930
- Everywhere...
Tryin' to find my Pear Pad!

17:58.931 --> 18:00.205
Why'd you call us here?

18:00.206 --> 18:02.033
- I need you guys to distract

18:02.034 --> 18:03.550
those three people
from Clam Jumper

18:03.551 --> 18:05.205
while Kenzie and I
get the wi-fi bridge

18:05.206 --> 18:07.102
over to that billboard
across the street.

18:07.103 --> 18:08.274
- Well what are we
supposed to do?

18:08.275 --> 18:09.619
- I don't know!

18:09.620 --> 18:11.517
Do I have to figure
out everything? Come on!

18:12.793 --> 18:15.654
- Hey hey heyyy...
Jerry, Pam, Otto...

18:15.655 --> 18:17.930
- Raar!

18:17.931 --> 18:19.274
- This is Trip and Hudson...

18:19.275 --> 18:20.999
They work with me and Kenzie
at Game Shakers.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.793
- I'm sorry, why are they here?

18:24.068 --> 18:26.895
- See, at the grand
opening party,

18:26.896 --> 18:30.930
they're going to...
perform.

18:30.931 --> 18:32.999
- Yeah...

18:33.000 --> 18:36.033
Show 'em what you're gonna do.

18:36.034 --> 18:38.171
- Oh, right.

18:38.172 --> 18:39.895
Uh... could you
please hand me that

18:39.896 --> 18:40.999
bucket of Clam Nuggets?

18:41.000 --> 18:42.585
- Okay.

18:42.586 --> 18:44.585
- Uh... what are you going
to do with our nuggets?

18:44.586 --> 18:47.550
- Well see,

18:47.551 --> 18:49.688
Hudson's gonna heave
these up in the air,

18:49.689 --> 18:53.826
and I'm gonna catch 'em...
in my mouth.

18:53.827 --> 18:57.343
- Yep yep, it's gonna be great,
watch them.

18:57.344 --> 18:58.895
- But...
- Wh-wha-why do we...

18:58.896 --> 19:01.826
Shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.

19:05.758 --> 19:07.551
- Get the wi-fi bridge out.
- 'Kay-kay.

19:15.206 --> 19:16.826
- Oh my.

19:16.827 --> 19:18.516
- Cool, right?

19:18.517 --> 19:19.964
- And you think that'll get this

19:19.965 --> 19:21.136
all the way over
to the billboard?

19:21.137 --> 19:22.792
- That's what Bobby Dong said.

19:22.793 --> 19:25.758
- Pull!
- Nugget away!

19:27.793 --> 19:29.447
- Ouuch!

19:29.448 --> 19:32.379
That hit my eyeball!

19:34.551 --> 19:36.930
Okay... now gimme the bridge.

19:36.931 --> 19:38.930
- Pull!

19:38.931 --> 19:40.241
- Owww!

19:42.551 --> 19:46.033
I just got hit in the head
with a Clam Nugget.

19:46.034 --> 19:48.964
- Now this time,
try to throw it up

19:48.965 --> 19:50.758
so I can catch...

19:53.482 --> 19:55.861
- Huh... unknown caller.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.462
Uh 'scuze me,
I think I should take this.

20:02.931 --> 20:04.619
- Whoa.
Who are you?

20:04.620 --> 20:06.930
- You want your Pear Pad back?

20:06.931 --> 20:08.378
- You have my Pear Pad?!?

20:08.379 --> 20:11.412
- Yes.
And I've seen that video.

20:11.413 --> 20:14.447
It would be quite embarrassing
for your father

20:14.448 --> 20:16.102
if I put it online.

20:16.103 --> 20:18.171
- Uh no!
You can't do that!

20:18.172 --> 20:20.067
Well then you're just
going to have to

20:20.068 --> 20:21.309
pay me a lot of money.

20:21.310 --> 20:22.688
- How much?

20:22.689 --> 20:24.550
- Uh... wait...

20:24.551 --> 20:26.447
how much is a used mini-van?

20:26.448 --> 20:28.067
- A used mini-van?!?

20:28.068 --> 20:29.654
- D'I'll call ya back.

20:29.655 --> 20:31.344
- No wait, I need my Pear Pa-

20:33.206 --> 20:34.481
- Hey, what's takin' so long?

20:34.482 --> 20:36.585
- Someone has my Pear Pad

20:36.586 --> 20:39.378
and they're threatening to put
that video of my dad online.

20:41.103 --> 20:42.964
- That'd make your
dad sooo angry.

20:42.965 --> 20:44.792
- That's not the problem.

20:44.793 --> 20:45.965
- Then what is?

20:47.586 --> 20:49.826
- If those Clam Jumper people
see that video

20:49.827 --> 20:51.964
of my dad laying
on the floor like a slob

20:51.965 --> 20:54.757
eatin' their food,
it could blow up the deal!

20:54.758 --> 20:56.033
- Nah.

20:56.034 --> 20:58.205
All those Clam people care about
is that billboard.

20:58.206 --> 20:59.826
- Man, I hope you're right.

20:59.827 --> 21:01.482
- Aren't I always right?

21:02.931 --> 21:04.240
- No!

21:04.241 --> 21:06.481
- Now come on!
Let's get back out there

21:06.482 --> 21:09.240
so I can throw some
Clam Nuggets at your face.

21:09.241 --> 21:11.689
- That didn't make me
feel better at all.

21:14.482 --> 21:15.792
- You're sure you know
what you're doing?

21:15.793 --> 21:17.481
- Yep, I just lock
in the coordinates

21:17.482 --> 21:20.343
of the billboard...

21:20.344 --> 21:22.000
and... bang!

21:32.103 --> 21:34.309
- Babe!
Was it supposed to fly

21:34.310 --> 21:35.619
right through the billboard?!?

21:35.620 --> 21:37.343
- No, it wasn't supposed to fly

21:37.344 --> 21:38.964
right through the billboard!

21:38.965 --> 21:41.550
- Oh Geez Louise, we
just broke the billboard!

21:41.551 --> 21:43.550
Do you know how much
that's gonna cost us?!?

21:43.551 --> 21:45.481
- Oh, we'll just pay for it
with the 10 million dollars

21:45.482 --> 21:47.448
that we're not gonna get!

21:48.689 --> 21:50.964
- Nugget away!

21:50.965 --> 21:52.930
- Owww!

21:52.931 --> 21:55.586
Hey!
Watch the nuggets?!?

22:03.206 --> 22:05.723
Mmm.

22:05.724 --> 22:08.689
