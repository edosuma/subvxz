00:00.273 --> 00:02.622
<i>Previously, on "Greenleaf"...</i>

00:02.656 --> 00:04.377
- Your Uncle Mac.
- What?

00:05.867 --> 00:08.402
- He did it again.
- Honestly, Gigi,

00:08.435 --> 00:09.937
<i>I don't think he ever really stopped.</i>

00:11.338 --> 00:12.511
I was wondering if I could talk to you

00:12.544 --> 00:13.826
for a few minutes about Danielle.

00:14.068 --> 00:15.772
We don't go to Calvary no more.

00:15.805 --> 00:17.940
I know, and I know why.

00:17.973 --> 00:19.842
I just want to give you a little advice.

00:19.874 --> 00:21.977
Before you pick up the phone,

00:22.011 --> 00:23.880
before you dial a number,

00:23.912 --> 00:27.583
before you do anything,
check your heart.

00:31.052 --> 00:34.689
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

00:34.722 --> 00:35.958
So, how'd she look?

00:37.693 --> 00:39.429
She's got nothing on you.

00:41.364 --> 00:42.831
I've done three hours of homework

00:42.865 --> 00:44.066
and I have another hour to go on this.

00:44.099 --> 00:45.668
I have to wear a school uniform

00:45.700 --> 00:47.114
that makes me look like a hippo,

00:47.139 --> 00:50.072
and you still haven't
explained why we moved here.

00:50.105 --> 00:51.941
I want to live with Dad.

00:58.112 --> 01:00.081
You're helping her go to school.

01:00.115 --> 01:01.950
Then next thing I know, you're
helping her with the car.

01:01.984 --> 01:03.477
Let her go, David.

01:04.453 --> 01:06.558
I will, Miss McCready.

01:07.223 --> 01:08.958
Not saying it like that, you won't.

01:09.437 --> 01:12.762
That's saying, "Miss
McCready, leave me alone.

01:12.794 --> 01:16.665
Mm-hmm. Let me keep on disrespecting
myself with this tramp."

01:20.869 --> 01:22.704
The drawer's light again.

01:30.746 --> 01:32.048
I'll talk to him.

01:36.752 --> 01:40.256
Sounds like some good fishing to me.

01:40.289 --> 01:41.724
They still stocking that lake?

01:41.756 --> 01:43.592
Jones Pond? They do twice a year.

01:43.625 --> 01:45.627
Mmm, Mae used to make a trout

01:45.661 --> 01:47.263
make you want to stand up
and slap somebody.

01:47.295 --> 01:49.130
- Wrapped in bacon.
- Whoo!

01:49.164 --> 01:50.266
I can't remember the last time

01:50.298 --> 01:51.833
I saw that woman in the kitchen.

01:51.866 --> 01:54.270
The Lord giveth
and the Lord taketh away.

01:54.303 --> 01:55.804
What are y'all doing this weekend?

01:55.837 --> 01:57.706
- Bishop?
- I don't know,

01:57.740 --> 01:58.974
but I guess we're about to find out.

01:59.008 --> 02:00.542
The "Memphis Daily News" just called.

02:00.575 --> 02:02.277
They said they heard
through the grapevine

02:02.310 --> 02:04.846
that we're stonewalling a Senate
inquiry into our finances.

02:04.880 --> 02:07.182
And whose grapevine
did they hear this through?

02:07.215 --> 02:09.185
- Bob Banks'?
- They wouldn't say.

02:09.217 --> 02:11.686
They just wanted to know
if such an inquiry exists.

02:11.720 --> 02:14.223
- What did you tell them?
- That it was news to me.

02:14.945 --> 02:16.125
That boy just won't give up.

02:16.157 --> 02:17.619
What do you want me to do?

02:19.222 --> 02:22.697
Have Conrad prep the jet for a
7:00 AM departure in the morning.

02:22.731 --> 02:23.908
Right away.

02:24.767 --> 02:26.202
Somewhere out at Shelby Farms,

02:26.234 --> 02:28.380
a trout's prayers just got answered.

02:29.238 --> 02:30.806
We're going to Nashville.

02:31.229 --> 02:34.134
_

02:37.016 --> 02:39.016
_

02:39.581 --> 02:42.651
Mom, are they going to make me pray?

02:45.253 --> 02:47.590
- Mom?
- Yeah?

02:47.622 --> 02:48.990
Are they going to make me pray?

02:49.024 --> 02:50.693
No one's going to make you
do anything, honey.

02:50.726 --> 02:52.762
You basically eat pizza
and watch movies.

02:52.794 --> 02:54.184
In prison.

02:54.662 --> 02:56.331
They don't actually
lock you in, you know.

02:56.364 --> 02:58.233
Let's roll.

03:00.134 --> 03:01.603
I don't want to do this.

03:01.637 --> 03:02.938
Zora, could you please tell your cousin

03:02.972 --> 03:04.240
<i>that church lock-ins are fun?</i>

03:04.273 --> 03:05.739
It's going to be fun.

03:06.341 --> 03:09.077
Thank you. Now, go. Go, go, go, go.

03:09.110 --> 03:11.441
I don't want Pastor Ramona
saying I made you two late.

03:12.114 --> 03:14.950
- God is good.
- All the time.

03:31.032 --> 03:32.601
Kevin, this is amazing.

03:32.634 --> 03:34.002
I've never seen a setup like this.

03:34.036 --> 03:37.273
I'm glad you're pleased, yeah.

03:37.305 --> 03:39.941
To be honest, other churches,
they give us space,

03:39.974 --> 03:43.144
but from when I first met you,

03:43.819 --> 03:45.246
Calvary's been the only one

03:45.280 --> 03:46.778
that's felt like a real partner.

03:50.085 --> 03:53.122
Well, my mom and I

03:53.155 --> 03:55.056
were homeless for a little while

03:55.090 --> 03:56.926
when my father left us.

03:56.959 --> 03:58.694
Yeah.

03:58.727 --> 04:00.795
I just want to make people feel,

04:00.829 --> 04:02.954
you know, like I always
wanted to feel...

04:03.666 --> 04:04.946
seen and...

04:06.090 --> 04:07.236
cared for.

04:10.839 --> 04:12.003
It's working.

04:14.209 --> 04:15.343
I'll hold down the fort.

04:15.377 --> 04:16.745
- And, uh...
- Yeah. Uh, yeah.

04:16.779 --> 04:20.649
Seriously, Kevin, thanks.

04:20.939 --> 04:22.635
Yeah, no worries.

04:23.185 --> 04:24.153
Our pleasure.

04:29.692 --> 04:30.716
Hey, how you doing?

04:32.461 --> 04:34.068
Pastor Greenleaf?

04:34.796 --> 04:35.860
Gigi?

04:36.699 --> 04:38.167
- Hey.
- Happy Friday.

04:38.199 --> 04:39.224
You, too.

04:39.735 --> 04:41.668
So, Sophia's going to the lock-in?

04:42.336 --> 04:44.272
Can you believe that?

04:44.305 --> 04:46.635
I mean, it seems just like
yesterday you and I...

04:47.375 --> 04:49.210
you know, we were going to those things.

04:49.243 --> 04:50.445
Oh, man.

04:50.478 --> 04:52.404
So, do you have any plans tonight?

04:52.880 --> 04:54.484
Is watching TV a plan?

04:54.769 --> 04:56.505
Have dinner with me and Isabel.

04:56.819 --> 04:58.187
Seriously?

04:58.219 --> 04:59.624
We're going to get barbeque.

05:00.988 --> 05:02.190
You sure she'd be into that?

05:02.223 --> 05:03.392
It was her idea.

05:03.425 --> 05:05.360
Uh...

05:05.394 --> 05:06.795
should I be worried?

05:07.239 --> 05:09.199
No, she just wants to meet you.

05:11.399 --> 05:13.034
All right, if you're okay with it.

05:13.067 --> 05:16.204
Great. Heavy Bettie's, 7:30.

05:16.238 --> 05:17.918
7:30. I'll be there.

05:18.406 --> 05:19.808
All right.

06:26.368 --> 06:27.964
Come in.

06:29.501 --> 06:31.203
Good evening, Pastor Greenleaf.

06:31.236 --> 06:33.606
Melisse, Kerissa's
giving Winkie his bath.

06:34.311 --> 06:35.774
All you'll need to do is lay him down

06:35.807 --> 06:37.275
and you can watch your program.

06:37.307 --> 06:39.010
Where y'all going to dinner tonight?

06:39.043 --> 06:42.480
Some new place downtown
with a private dining room.

06:42.514 --> 06:44.750
- What's the occasion?
- <i>Nothing good.</i>

06:44.783 --> 06:48.120
Kerissa trying to...

06:48.153 --> 06:50.655
solidify our ties with the deacons

06:50.687 --> 06:52.331
now that I'm in charge of the board.

06:52.365 --> 06:55.093
- Good evening, Melisse.
- Good evening, Mrs. Greenleaf.

06:55.125 --> 06:56.394
Is my husband whining

06:56.427 --> 06:58.230
about being trotted out
like a show pony?

06:58.262 --> 07:00.498
No, not at all.

07:00.531 --> 07:02.433
- He's ready for his books.
- Okay.

07:04.836 --> 07:06.504
Night, Wink. Love you.

07:06.538 --> 07:07.773
See you later.

07:10.841 --> 07:13.110
It would be really nice
if you acted a little bit

07:13.144 --> 07:14.747
like we were on the same team tonight.

07:21.552 --> 07:23.120
Yes, ma'am.

07:47.411 --> 07:49.246
<i>Yeah.</i>

08:06.297 --> 08:07.799
Come on, y'all.

08:30.822 --> 08:33.457
Thank you for my serenade, baby.

08:33.490 --> 08:35.136
Any time.

08:36.793 --> 08:39.364
I sure wouldn't want to follow that.

08:39.397 --> 08:41.500
Two shots of fireball.

08:41.533 --> 08:43.567
- Oh!
- Did you order these?

08:43.601 --> 08:45.064
No.

08:45.470 --> 08:47.572
They're from the gentlemen over there.

08:51.643 --> 08:53.812
Well, go ahead, Mr. Wonder.

08:53.845 --> 08:56.848
It's your own fault for singing so good.

08:56.880 --> 08:59.283
All right, and this is your last one.

08:59.317 --> 09:00.485
I know, Daddy.

09:00.518 --> 09:01.820
Bottoms up.

09:06.490 --> 09:07.528
Ooh!

09:08.326 --> 09:10.394
Let's try that again.

09:20.672 --> 09:22.908
You haven't seen Jacob preach yet.

09:24.708 --> 09:26.410
That might be for the best.

09:26.443 --> 09:28.512
He is just being modest.
You are in for a real treat.

09:30.548 --> 09:33.784
Well, he can't be worse than that
senior pastor back in Little Rock.

09:33.817 --> 09:37.613
We had this elderly member die
during one of his sermons.

09:37.647 --> 09:40.292
She just tipped her head back
and she passed away.

09:40.325 --> 09:42.036
- No!
- Eyes glazed over,bubbled up

09:42.061 --> 09:42.961
 at the ceiling,

09:42.994 --> 09:45.897
and no one thought anything about it.

09:45.929 --> 09:47.932
Oh, no. That's not Jacob.

09:47.966 --> 09:49.935
He's not fatally boring by any means.

09:51.235 --> 09:53.337
I hope not.

09:53.370 --> 09:56.774
It's just that, you know, he's, um...
he's really passionate

09:56.807 --> 09:59.510
about keeping his preaching
doctrinally sound,

09:59.543 --> 10:02.213
and, you know, some people
can't always follow.

10:03.715 --> 10:06.518
Especially if they were
raised on that, you know,

10:06.551 --> 10:09.321
"Y'all done messed around
and lost out with God!

10:09.354 --> 10:12.857
And now God done turnt
it over to the phonies,

10:12.889 --> 10:15.961
and, uh, hey!"

10:15.994 --> 10:17.696
You're making fun of Daddy.

10:17.729 --> 10:19.931
<i>No! No, you know what I mean.</i>

10:19.963 --> 10:21.865
That whooping style of preaching.

10:21.899 --> 10:24.001
No, Jacob is more moderate.

10:24.034 --> 10:25.536
He just gives you the facts

10:25.570 --> 10:27.739
and leaves you to feel the feelings.

10:27.772 --> 10:31.843
We like the idea of a well-reasoned
faith, that's for sure.

10:31.875 --> 10:34.411
You shouldn't have to check your
brain at the door of the church.

10:34.851 --> 10:36.414
See?

10:36.447 --> 10:38.783
I told you these were
our kind of people.

10:38.816 --> 10:40.808
What a blessing.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.488
Hear, hear.

11:00.672 --> 11:02.307
So, you quit your job at the TV station,

11:02.340 --> 11:03.346
just like that?

11:03.379 --> 11:06.343
- Yeah.
- Whew! So jealous.

11:06.376 --> 11:07.846
Of what?

11:07.879 --> 11:10.414
That kind of reckless impulsivity.

11:10.447 --> 11:12.049
Like, I can't make a single decision

11:12.082 --> 11:15.586
without weighing every
consideration at least 800 times.

11:15.620 --> 11:16.955
You think she's kidding.

11:16.987 --> 11:18.756
We dated two and a half
years long distance

11:18.789 --> 11:20.324
before she finally moved down.

11:20.357 --> 11:22.059
So what finally tipped
the scales for you?

11:22.092 --> 11:24.695
I convinced Kerissa to offer her a
teaching job over at Excellence.

11:24.729 --> 11:26.998
No, it wasn't that. Don't say that.

11:27.030 --> 11:29.366
- Well, what convinced you?
- I don't know.

11:29.399 --> 11:31.635
I was just starting to feel like
whatever I was doing in Dallas,

11:31.668 --> 11:32.670
<i>he was missing.</i>

11:34.806 --> 11:36.441
How did you guys meet?

11:36.474 --> 11:37.742
At Essence Festival.

11:37.774 --> 11:39.343
Oh.

11:39.376 --> 11:41.945
Well, I'm glad all the waiting paid off.

11:41.979 --> 11:42.881
Yeah.

11:46.583 --> 11:48.652
So, what brought you here?

11:48.686 --> 11:50.622
I know you came back
for Faith's funeral.

11:50.654 --> 11:52.524
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry about that.

11:52.557 --> 11:53.825
Thank you.

11:53.857 --> 11:55.592
But what made you decide to stay?

11:55.625 --> 11:58.629
Were you interested in getting
back into the ministry or...?

11:58.663 --> 12:01.765
Yeah. Yeah, I guess it had
been on my mind for a while.

12:02.162 --> 12:04.234
So some good came from all that, right?

12:04.769 --> 12:05.889
Yeah.

12:06.604 --> 12:08.040
Well, praise God, right?

12:11.008 --> 12:12.977
Hi. Can we get a table for three?

12:13.009 --> 12:13.912
Sure.

12:15.671 --> 12:17.206
<i>He knows where the car is.</i>

12:17.239 --> 12:19.041
<i>We just have to
get there before he does.</i>

12:19.075 --> 12:20.676
<i>What about the others?</i>

12:20.709 --> 12:22.744
- <i>They're all okay.</i>
- <i>Come on.</i>

12:22.777 --> 12:24.556
I'm glad you moved here.

12:25.580 --> 12:26.648
Why?

12:26.681 --> 12:28.517
I always wanted a sister.

12:31.521 --> 12:33.555
<i>- What was that?</i>
<i>- What do you mean?</i>

12:33.589 --> 12:36.792
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

12:36.825 --> 12:38.094
<i>Ow, ow!</i>

12:38.127 --> 12:39.561
I'll be right back.

12:39.594 --> 12:41.763
<i>You okay?</i>

12:41.796 --> 12:43.599
<i>Careful.</i>

12:43.632 --> 12:46.935
<i>Come on, you have to get up.</i>

12:56.978 --> 12:58.180
Do you want to get high?

12:59.949 --> 13:01.618
Where? We're locked in.

13:01.651 --> 13:03.085
We're not actually locked in.

13:03.118 --> 13:04.553
Do you want to get high or not?

13:06.289 --> 13:08.658
- Yeah, okay.
- Come on, come on.

13:11.960 --> 13:13.762
Let's go.

13:13.796 --> 13:15.098
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

13:17.132 --> 13:19.102
So, how are the wedding plans coming?

13:19.134 --> 13:22.004
- It's crazy.
- Mm-hmm.

13:22.037 --> 13:24.106
Before we started this whole process,

13:24.140 --> 13:25.909
I would have been fine just eloping,

13:25.941 --> 13:29.278
but now I have opinions
about tea lights...

13:29.311 --> 13:30.746
strong opinions.

13:30.780 --> 13:32.863
Go on, girl. Have those opinions.

13:33.616 --> 13:35.118
What about you? Did you ever go through

13:35.151 --> 13:37.887
this whole wedding
planning process madness?

13:37.920 --> 13:40.089
No, I dodged that bullet.

13:41.930 --> 13:44.293
I mean, Noah told me you and
Sophia's dad never got married,

13:44.326 --> 13:46.729
but was there ever a time
you were thinking about it?

13:48.330 --> 13:49.965
No, there was never an idea.

13:49.998 --> 13:52.067
Hmm. You're independent.

13:54.336 --> 13:55.616
Historically, yeah.

13:56.504 --> 13:58.240
Again, I'm jealous.

14:00.843 --> 14:02.759
We really are so different.

14:03.211 --> 14:04.617
It's funny.

14:07.532 --> 14:09.151
Well, that's enough about us.

14:09.185 --> 14:10.553
How did you two meet?

14:10.586 --> 14:12.988
Oh, how did we meet?

14:13.022 --> 14:14.141
Now, that's a story.

14:15.313 --> 14:18.091
We both worked at ACH in Little Rock,

14:18.610 --> 14:20.821
and Fred was called in one night

14:20.846 --> 14:23.405
to meet with the son
of a patient of mine

14:23.438 --> 14:26.833
right after the boy's mom
had lost a baby girl.

14:27.751 --> 14:30.554
We went out for coffee after

14:30.587 --> 14:32.790
and we spent the whole
next day together.

14:33.083 --> 14:34.892
Never got any sleep.

14:34.926 --> 14:36.351
I didn't want to say good-bye.

14:37.629 --> 14:39.183
And I kissed her once.

14:40.097 --> 14:43.000
A week later, he called
me up and asked me out,

14:43.033 --> 14:44.782
and I said yes.

14:45.636 --> 14:47.071
Later that night, he picked me up.

14:47.105 --> 14:49.605
And on our way to dinner,

14:50.332 --> 14:53.712
he pulled over,
stopped the car, and said,

14:54.708 --> 14:58.015
"Can I have your permission
to do something crazy?"

14:58.048 --> 15:01.752
And she said, "Sure, I guess."

15:01.785 --> 15:04.555
And then he pulled out a ring
and asked me to marry him.

15:04.993 --> 15:06.924
After only one kiss?

15:06.957 --> 15:09.073
I knew she was the one.

15:10.028 --> 15:12.130
And you said yes just like that?

15:12.432 --> 15:14.762
<i>He was everything I
thought he was and more.</i>

15:15.133 --> 15:17.202
Best decision I ever made.

15:20.638 --> 15:23.675
I've never heard of anything
like that happening in my life.

15:25.577 --> 15:27.879
I just want to tell you,
that was my best decision, too.

15:32.182 --> 15:34.298
<i>I can't even believe it.</i>

15:34.985 --> 15:36.955
<i>I take you in off the street.</i>

15:36.987 --> 15:38.945
I give you a hot meal every day.

15:39.496 --> 15:40.764
Numbers don't lie.

15:40.991 --> 15:42.226
So, you didn't steal the money?

15:42.526 --> 15:43.935
No, ma'am.

15:44.761 --> 15:45.774
You sure?

15:46.697 --> 15:48.132
Because if this was "Millionaire,"

15:48.165 --> 15:51.728
I'd ask you, "Is that
your final answer?"

15:52.937 --> 15:55.137
- Well, is it?
- Yes, ma'am.

15:55.707 --> 15:58.186
- William.
- Yes, ma'am?

15:58.676 --> 16:00.812
If you are lying to me about this

16:00.845 --> 16:02.781
and I find out you're lying to me,

16:02.813 --> 16:04.682
I'm not just going to fire you.

16:04.716 --> 16:06.689
I'm going to turn you
over to the police,

16:07.284 --> 16:09.154
and I'm not playing with you.

16:09.187 --> 16:11.023
You know I will do it.

16:14.726 --> 16:16.601
My mama's car is bust.

16:17.699 --> 16:18.996
So, you did it.

16:19.029 --> 16:21.298
Only because her car is bust
and she said she would...

16:21.332 --> 16:23.897
Tell me, why is your
mother's car busted?

16:24.202 --> 16:26.870
- Tell me. Why?
- She wrecked it.

16:26.904 --> 16:28.477
Driving drunk.

16:29.438 --> 16:31.676
Yes, ma'am.

16:31.708 --> 16:33.844
And she told you to do this?

16:33.878 --> 16:35.347
She told you to steal from me?

16:35.380 --> 16:37.082
No, ma'am.

16:38.383 --> 16:39.586
Don't you see?

16:39.611 --> 16:41.853
You keep letting her
take hold of you like this,

16:41.885 --> 16:44.288
she's just going to
drag you down with her.

16:44.322 --> 16:46.647
But what's she going to do
if I can't bring the money...

16:46.672 --> 16:49.360
What's she going to do?
I don't care what she does.

16:49.394 --> 16:50.995
You're the one I care about!

16:51.402 --> 16:52.570
You!

16:54.332 --> 16:55.659
I'll pay it back.

16:56.234 --> 16:58.203
You damn right,
you're going to pay it back.

16:58.235 --> 17:00.871
You going to work every Sunday

17:00.905 --> 17:03.774
for the next four Sundays
cleaning up that basement

17:03.808 --> 17:05.777
until we get organized
for the renovation.

17:05.810 --> 17:07.378
Now, you get that?

17:07.411 --> 17:08.739
Yes, ma'am.

17:09.414 --> 17:10.815
Now, get on out of here.

17:10.848 --> 17:12.349
Help David with those glasses.

17:12.382 --> 17:13.984
Yes, ma'am.

17:24.861 --> 17:26.763
Don't be mad.

17:26.797 --> 17:28.065
I'm a lightweight.

17:28.098 --> 17:30.135
I'm not mad, baby. I'm not mad.

17:31.803 --> 17:33.405
I know that face, Kevvie.

17:33.437 --> 17:35.072
Girl, you can't even see my face.

17:35.105 --> 17:38.909
Sure, I can. I see both of them.

17:41.278 --> 17:44.848
Oh, you sang so good tonight.

17:44.881 --> 17:46.351
You did, too, baby,

17:46.383 --> 17:48.252
better than that girl at Smokey Joe's.

17:48.285 --> 17:50.421
Oh, I was so proud

17:50.455 --> 17:53.423
when those guys sent those shots.

17:54.458 --> 17:59.096
You know, gay men know good singing.

17:59.130 --> 18:01.099
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

18:01.131 --> 18:04.436
Well, I only sang that good
'cause I was singing to you.

18:07.839 --> 18:09.207
Mm-hmm.

18:11.309 --> 18:13.378
Let's take a pregnancy test.

18:15.312 --> 18:19.383
Uh, why don't we just
do it in the morning?

18:20.485 --> 18:22.180
I want to take one now.

18:23.592 --> 18:25.027
I got to pee anyway.

18:27.158 --> 18:29.293
- All right, come on.
- Yes. Ooh!

18:29.326 --> 18:32.429
- Hurry up!
- Just hold on for a second.

18:32.463 --> 18:34.024
Have you tried to open
one of these things?

18:34.049 --> 18:35.758
Maybe.

18:38.503 --> 18:42.139
You're the best husband ever.

18:42.172 --> 18:43.459
Yeah.

18:45.943 --> 18:47.079
Here.

18:57.354 --> 18:58.856
Here.

18:58.889 --> 19:00.122
I can't see.

19:00.891 --> 19:02.093
Let me help, okay?

19:06.030 --> 19:07.474
I love you.

19:09.801 --> 19:11.102
Love you, too.

19:22.546 --> 19:23.447
Hey.

19:28.052 --> 19:30.848
Why can't we just make a
donation to his campaign?

19:31.389 --> 19:34.525
The thought of you rattling
around in that old tin thing...

19:34.559 --> 19:36.027
I know it worries you.

19:36.060 --> 19:39.364
Worries me? It agonizes me.

19:39.397 --> 19:41.899
Do you know that I still have nightmares

19:41.933 --> 19:43.535
about that storm on the way to Cabo?

19:43.568 --> 19:46.709
I thought that old plane
was just going to break in half.

19:47.405 --> 19:49.374
Well, it's just a half-hour flight.

19:49.407 --> 19:50.908
Hmm.

19:50.941 --> 19:52.910
Unfortunately,
this is one of those trips

19:52.944 --> 19:55.547
where I have to render unto
Caesar what is Caesar's.

19:55.580 --> 19:57.081
And Caesar wants money.

19:58.568 --> 20:01.152
Well, this Caesar wants respect.

20:02.677 --> 20:04.489
How can I put this?

20:04.522 --> 20:06.224
Is this where you're going to make

20:06.256 --> 20:08.392
a big, fancy argument about why you need

20:08.426 --> 20:10.227
to give your loving wife a heart attack?

20:10.261 --> 20:12.397
- Oh, stop.
- All right, go ahead.

20:12.429 --> 20:13.825
Senator Banks,

20:14.264 --> 20:17.112
in order to ascend
the earthly heights he has,

20:17.968 --> 20:19.984
made a number of bad deals.

20:21.104 --> 20:22.573
He promised his black constituents

20:22.607 --> 20:24.600
that he would fight for their rights.

20:25.275 --> 20:28.245
Once he got in office,
he promised his white peers

20:28.278 --> 20:29.968
that he wouldn't fight too hard.

20:30.614 --> 20:32.249
Cashed in his credibility

20:32.283 --> 20:34.418
earned on the front lines
of the movement

20:34.696 --> 20:36.320
for a seat at a table

20:36.353 --> 20:38.673
Jesus Christ would've
overturned in a fit of rage.

20:39.156 --> 20:43.364
In short, in search
for his earthly power,

20:44.128 --> 20:46.130
he's distanced himself from his race,

20:46.162 --> 20:47.505
from his religion,

20:47.998 --> 20:49.912
I'm guessing even his own soul.

20:50.267 --> 20:51.969
And he won't be happy

20:52.303 --> 20:54.139
until everybody else does the same.

20:55.406 --> 20:57.132
Misery loves company.

20:58.970 --> 21:00.612
In this case, it demands it.

21:02.146 --> 21:04.549
- Then it's settled.
- What?

21:04.582 --> 21:06.117
I'm coming with you.

21:06.149 --> 21:07.252
Mmm.

21:07.584 --> 21:09.519
And risk the unfriendly skies?

21:09.941 --> 21:12.493
Well, I do need a new dress,

21:13.157 --> 21:17.562
and they have that Chanel boutique

21:17.594 --> 21:20.931
at the Nashville Nordstrom's, so...

21:20.965 --> 21:22.934
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

21:22.966 --> 21:24.369
Well, how about that?

21:24.401 --> 21:25.903
Oh, that's good.

21:25.937 --> 21:29.573
Oh, you do have such healing hands.

21:32.176 --> 21:35.612
So, you get high?

21:35.646 --> 21:37.248
Why wouldn't I?

21:37.281 --> 21:38.637
I don't know.

21:39.516 --> 21:42.019
Just 'cause you're, like, serious.

21:42.053 --> 21:43.420
I am serious.

21:43.454 --> 21:46.157
And I'm about to get seriously high.

21:48.693 --> 21:49.994
That's right.

21:50.026 --> 21:51.662
I'm equal opportunity serious.

21:53.809 --> 21:56.601
We should get back in before
Pastor Ramona checks back in.

21:56.633 --> 21:57.668
What should I do with this?

21:57.701 --> 21:58.826
Just toss it.

22:00.071 --> 22:02.407
- Uh-oh.
- What?

22:02.439 --> 22:04.019
We're locked out.

22:04.641 --> 22:06.276
Run that way. Run that way.

22:06.310 --> 22:07.290
Come on!

22:10.547 --> 22:12.683
Mmm!

22:12.716 --> 22:14.351
I'll go get some to-go boxes.

22:14.385 --> 22:17.289
- I always order too much.
- I do the same thing.

22:19.547 --> 22:20.803
Was this okay?

22:21.225 --> 22:22.649
Yeah.

22:23.393 --> 22:24.428
She's great.

22:24.462 --> 22:26.066
Isn't she?

22:27.130 --> 22:28.499
I'm really, really lucky.

22:30.633 --> 22:32.370
It's just amazing to feel

22:32.402 --> 22:34.271
like you've found the person
you're going to be with,

22:34.304 --> 22:36.207
that that's done.

22:36.239 --> 22:37.175
I bet.

22:40.904 --> 22:41.920
What?

22:42.991 --> 22:44.749
When you left 20 years ago,

22:44.782 --> 22:46.417
I was a jerk. I'm sorry.

22:46.449 --> 22:48.704
- No, you weren't a jerk.
- Yeah, I was.

22:49.253 --> 22:51.456
It's been driving me crazy
ever since you got back.

22:51.935 --> 22:53.992
It just took me by surprise.

22:54.425 --> 22:56.127
Like, it came out of the blue.

22:56.559 --> 22:59.331
<i>You want to leave, then you're gone.</i>

23:01.032 --> 23:03.176
But you were right, obviously,

23:03.767 --> 23:05.269
and I'm happy now.

23:07.437 --> 23:09.794
I just want to clear the
air and say I'm sorry.

23:10.274 --> 23:11.336
That's it.

23:12.376 --> 23:14.712
- What did I miss?
- I was just singing your praises.

23:14.745 --> 23:17.482
Aww.

23:21.619 --> 23:23.187
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

23:25.790 --> 23:27.808
- Hello?
<i>- Pastor Greenleaf?</i>

23:27.840 --> 23:30.695
- This is she.
- <i>It's Danielle Turner.</i>

23:44.735 --> 23:46.539
- Shh, shh.
- Shh!

23:50.543 --> 23:51.879
Excuse me?

23:54.059 --> 23:55.828
Where y'all coming from?

23:55.862 --> 23:58.464
We were trying to get to the movie room,

23:58.497 --> 24:00.834
but ended up in the Family
Life Center by mistake.

24:00.866 --> 24:02.501
And the doors were locked,
because I guess they didn't want

24:02.535 --> 24:05.004
the homeless people coming after us.

24:05.037 --> 24:06.940
So, we went out the back exit

24:07.474 --> 24:09.107
and we came around.

24:09.141 --> 24:11.244
All right.

24:11.277 --> 24:12.979
Y'all get back in there.

24:13.011 --> 24:14.480
God is good.

24:14.512 --> 24:16.408
All the time.

24:19.919 --> 24:21.554
That's not true!

24:21.586 --> 24:23.155
I know. I was there.

24:23.189 --> 24:25.959
Okay, the shade was, like,
all over the place, okay?

24:25.991 --> 24:28.327
- <i>They was throwing all kind of shade.</i>
<i>- Yeah, she did.</i>

24:28.361 --> 24:30.997
- Really? Who was it, then?
- Nuh-uh, that is not on me.

24:31.029 --> 24:32.931
<i>- No, no, no, no.</i>
<i>- That's your friend.</i>

24:32.964 --> 24:34.466
Pastor Greenleaf?

24:34.499 --> 24:36.202
Hey.

24:37.965 --> 24:39.534
Yeah, that's me.

24:39.971 --> 24:41.206
Thanks for calling.

24:41.239 --> 24:43.084
How'd you find my email?

24:43.541 --> 24:45.144
Church directory.

24:46.945 --> 24:48.413
Does your mom know you're here?

24:48.447 --> 24:49.651
No.

24:49.981 --> 24:52.011
She thinks I'm at a friend's house.

24:53.451 --> 24:54.621
What do you want?

24:59.325 --> 25:03.095
All right, everybody! Closing time.

25:03.128 --> 25:04.496
Y'all know the rules.

25:04.529 --> 25:06.098
Time to get out.

25:06.452 --> 25:08.433
And you two, no driving.

25:08.467 --> 25:10.603
I want to make sure y'all
get to Graceland tomorrow.

25:10.635 --> 25:12.939
David, see them out.
Make sure they get a cab.

25:12.971 --> 25:14.374
- Yes, ma'am.
- Get out of here safe.

25:14.406 --> 25:17.609
- Good night!
- We're good.

25:17.643 --> 25:21.447
- Night, Miss McCready.
- Night, fellas.

25:21.480 --> 25:24.879
Kenny, good night. Take
care of yourself. Be safe.

25:24.913 --> 25:26.286
<i>All right. Get
yourself some rest tonight.</i>

25:26.318 --> 25:28.020
All right.

25:41.400 --> 25:43.136
What the hell are you doing here?

25:43.642 --> 25:45.767
I'm just checking up on my sister.

25:46.439 --> 25:48.007
Get the hell out of my place.

25:48.039 --> 25:49.642
I saw the mayor today, Mavis.

25:49.674 --> 25:53.379
He mentioned your expansion plans.

25:54.980 --> 25:56.134
Did he, now?

25:56.166 --> 25:58.518
Yeah, because he still
thinks of us as family.

26:00.668 --> 26:01.818
Ain't that something?

26:02.540 --> 26:04.190
You better get out of here.

26:04.222 --> 26:06.191
I've got some friends
on the Landmarks Commission

26:06.224 --> 26:09.028
who've had their eye on this
building for a while now.

26:09.060 --> 26:13.566
Guess it used to be an abolitionist
newspaper back in the 1850s.

26:13.598 --> 26:17.202
Well, they've talked in the past
about taking this place over,

26:17.236 --> 26:19.572
making it into a museum or something.

26:20.044 --> 26:22.976
I own this place outright.

26:23.008 --> 26:24.643
I know that. They know that.

26:24.676 --> 26:27.045
But there's also such a
thing as eminent domain,

26:27.867 --> 26:30.115
and what with all this
heat around Kenny Collins,

26:30.149 --> 26:31.651
I know the mayor's looking for ways

26:31.683 --> 26:34.644
of showing he's all
about the black folks.

26:35.852 --> 26:38.391
And what the hell are you all about?

26:41.293 --> 26:43.108
You want to keep your club?

26:44.296 --> 26:46.532
You want to keep strutting
up and down Beale Street

26:46.565 --> 26:49.235
like some kind of cheap-ass Jesus

26:49.268 --> 26:51.337
to these $3.00 ticket scratchers?

26:58.277 --> 27:00.180
Tell Gigi to leave it alone.

27:04.416 --> 27:05.384
Mac.

27:10.288 --> 27:12.624
I don't know how you got
to be the way you are.

27:13.459 --> 27:17.662
I don't know if Daddy did
something I don't know about...

27:17.695 --> 27:19.131
<i>maybe Mama.</i>

27:19.164 --> 27:20.566
<i>I don't know, I don't care.</i>

27:21.143 --> 27:23.435
God knows I had my share
of pain from them,

27:23.469 --> 27:25.104
but I didn't go handing it on

27:25.136 --> 27:27.640
like it was some kind of gift.

27:28.239 --> 27:30.815
Now, it's one thing to be sick.

27:31.477 --> 27:34.280
It's another thing to go walking around

27:34.313 --> 27:36.049
peacocking about it.

27:37.348 --> 27:38.650
From what I remember of my Bible,

27:38.683 --> 27:41.620
that kind of prancing
is reserved for Satan.

27:47.326 --> 27:48.468
You...

27:49.327 --> 27:51.364
you ain't gonna win this time.

27:52.565 --> 27:56.568
This time, brother, you going down.

28:16.654 --> 28:19.791
He came to my house a few times,

28:19.825 --> 28:21.482
talked to my mom.

28:22.161 --> 28:23.296
That's it.

28:23.617 --> 28:24.629
Nothing you said

28:24.662 --> 28:26.632
in your first statement
to the police happened?

28:27.497 --> 28:28.668
No.

28:29.738 --> 28:31.203
Mr. McCready never took you

28:31.237 --> 28:33.135
to the church's camp at Blue Basin?

28:33.168 --> 28:34.239
No.

28:34.272 --> 28:35.640
He never touched you?

28:36.373 --> 28:37.589
No.

28:38.143 --> 28:39.550
He never did anything.

28:41.062 --> 28:43.269
I've never even been alone with him...

28:44.383 --> 28:45.617
ever.

28:45.651 --> 28:48.087
So, why did you say he raped you?

28:51.556 --> 28:52.892
I wanted attention.

28:53.574 --> 28:56.595
Danielle, what you said
in your first statement...

28:59.597 --> 29:02.014
Mac actually did to my sister...

29:02.701 --> 29:05.293
not just once, a lot...

29:06.238 --> 29:08.173
until she couldn't take it anymore

29:08.207 --> 29:09.709
and she told me all about it.

29:11.876 --> 29:15.847
So, I told our parents,
and they didn't believe me.

29:15.881 --> 29:18.151
And I said, "Ask Faith.
She'll tell you."

29:19.568 --> 29:21.153
And you know what?

29:24.556 --> 29:29.162
She said it hadn't
happened, just like you.

29:31.529 --> 29:33.165
Why do you think she did that?

29:38.100 --> 29:39.068
Mmm.

29:40.706 --> 29:44.477
Maybe she was scared.

29:47.268 --> 29:48.470
Of what?

29:48.869 --> 29:52.325
Ruining everything for everybody.

29:53.725 --> 29:54.921
Yeah, that makes sense.

29:56.454 --> 29:57.823
But you know what?

30:00.625 --> 30:03.108
Because she went back on her story,

30:04.669 --> 30:07.333
because she didn't tell the truth,

30:07.688 --> 30:10.702
Mac went on and did
the same thing to other girls.

30:12.938 --> 30:14.741
And my sister...

30:16.307 --> 30:17.743
What happened?

30:19.778 --> 30:21.247
She never got over it.

30:22.948 --> 30:24.684
She killed herself.

30:28.253 --> 30:30.755
Trying to keep from ruining everything

30:30.788 --> 30:32.325
ruined everything.

30:34.793 --> 30:36.608
I don't know what to tell you.

30:37.730 --> 30:41.701
I'm sorry about what
happened to your sister,

30:41.733 --> 30:44.720
but it never happened to me.

30:45.837 --> 30:47.572
Please just leave my family alone.

30:47.605 --> 30:49.642
Danielle, is somebody making
you change your story?

30:49.674 --> 30:52.677
- I got to go.
- Danielle, please!

30:52.710 --> 30:54.947
I know it happened.

30:54.980 --> 30:57.143
We both know it happened.

30:58.608 --> 31:00.465
It didn't happen.

31:01.386 --> 31:02.975
It didn't.

31:04.246 --> 31:05.515
Just looks that way.

31:07.754 --> 31:09.079
Really, it...

31:11.416 --> 31:12.765
it was all my fault.

31:13.625 --> 31:15.268
Honey.

31:36.387 --> 31:39.088
- Oh, I can stop reading.
- You don't have to.

31:39.857 --> 31:42.274
Ever been to anything like this?

31:43.062 --> 31:44.363
No.

31:44.395 --> 31:45.730
Did you have fun?

31:45.764 --> 31:47.833
Yeah, it was okay.

31:47.865 --> 31:51.037
Zora told me you go to Excellence.

31:51.370 --> 31:52.371
Yeah.

31:52.403 --> 31:54.039
That's a hard school.

31:54.073 --> 31:56.709
It is. Yeah, it's intense.

31:56.741 --> 32:00.845
I'm actually reading this for school.

32:01.112 --> 32:03.014
It's not even for history, though.

32:03.047 --> 32:05.816
The math teacher
just makes us read stuff.

32:07.385 --> 32:09.176
Mind if I ask you a question?

32:10.722 --> 32:15.027
Um, yeah, I guess.

32:15.616 --> 32:16.995
Are you saved?

32:19.597 --> 32:21.576
There's no right or wrong answer.

32:23.216 --> 32:26.405
Do I have to be to be in youth group?

32:26.438 --> 32:27.632
No.

32:28.606 --> 32:30.152
I believe.

32:30.576 --> 32:32.044
Now, most kids here say they believe,

32:32.076 --> 32:34.946
but I don't know if they really do.

32:35.512 --> 32:38.022
It's not my job
to search people's hearts.

32:38.584 --> 32:41.984
I believe you're God's child.

32:42.653 --> 32:45.056
And I know his spirit
lives inside of you.

32:45.744 --> 32:47.416
How do you know?

32:47.925 --> 32:49.416
I just do.

32:49.894 --> 32:51.396
I see it.

32:54.066 --> 32:55.468
I'll let you get back to your book.

32:55.500 --> 32:56.701
Okay.

32:56.735 --> 32:58.904
I like the braids, by the way.

32:58.937 --> 33:00.906
Oh, thanks. Zora did them.

33:00.939 --> 33:03.008
- See you in the morning.
- Mm-hmm.

33:08.547 --> 33:11.451
Oh, my God.

33:16.822 --> 33:18.457
Hey, are you okay?

33:18.489 --> 33:20.559
- Yeah.
- Do you need anything?

34:32.380 --> 34:33.914
Could have caught my limit by now.

34:33.947 --> 34:35.516
Mm-hmm.

34:35.550 --> 34:37.985
Every time we fly, it's the same thing.

34:38.018 --> 34:40.521
We just sit here for hours and hours.

34:40.554 --> 34:42.991
- It is never hours and hours.
- Oh.

34:43.023 --> 34:45.527
We better get moving now if
we're going to make this lunch.

34:45.559 --> 34:47.328
Conrad, tell me something good.

34:47.748 --> 34:49.764
- I wish I could, sir.
<i>- Every time.</i>

34:49.797 --> 34:51.498
<i>Every single time.</i>

34:51.532 --> 34:53.534
Mae, will you just stop?

34:53.567 --> 34:57.004
Every single time it's something
with this gimcrack piece of trash.

34:57.038 --> 34:59.039
- We ain't going nowhere today.
- What's the problem this time?

34:59.072 --> 35:02.443
It looks like a fuel leak,
but we can't seem to find it.

35:02.476 --> 35:04.011
I'm happy it's leaking,
because they need

35:04.045 --> 35:05.847
to take that horse to the glue factory.

35:05.880 --> 35:07.015
Look, we need to get to Nashville.

35:07.047 --> 35:08.549
Senator Banks is waiting on us.

35:08.583 --> 35:10.117
Well, you could fly commercial.

35:10.150 --> 35:12.986
Oh, no! Uh-uh.

35:13.717 --> 35:15.825
Excuse me.

35:15.856 --> 35:18.433
<i>Marcus, we're going back home!</i>

35:18.466 --> 35:20.528
I'm sorry, sir. It's an old plane.

35:20.561 --> 35:21.896
Just forget it.

35:23.498 --> 35:26.568
You want me to call Banks's office?

35:26.601 --> 35:27.649
No.

35:29.003 --> 35:30.739
I want you to get me a new jet.

35:36.777 --> 35:39.480
Wow. Really?

35:39.514 --> 35:41.883
At least they threw it
in the trash. Hey!

35:41.916 --> 35:43.751
- Hey! What's going on?
- Nothing.

35:43.784 --> 35:45.819
Someone started a fire
in the Dumpster last night.

35:45.853 --> 35:49.057
- No big deal.
- Ooh, shades of 1992.

35:49.090 --> 35:50.492
- Completely.
- Here.

35:50.525 --> 35:51.945
Oh, thanks.

35:52.460 --> 35:53.728
So, you're here to pick up Sophia?

35:53.760 --> 35:55.063
Oh, no, Kerissa is getting the girls,

35:55.096 --> 35:56.530
taking them straight to soccer.

35:56.563 --> 35:57.898
I need to talk to you.

35:59.699 --> 36:01.837
- Got a minute?
- Sure.

36:11.779 --> 36:13.614
So, how'd it go?

36:13.648 --> 36:16.084
Really well, I think, for the
first night of the program.

36:16.117 --> 36:17.452
Quiet.

36:17.485 --> 36:19.120
- Quiet's good.
- Yes, it is.

36:19.152 --> 36:20.955
We make a heck of a team.

36:22.789 --> 36:25.626
Yeah, uh, got some big news last night.

36:25.659 --> 36:26.693
Yeah? What about?

36:27.190 --> 36:28.864
Charity and I are having a baby.

36:31.231 --> 36:33.735
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Thank you.

36:33.768 --> 36:35.770
You don't have any kids, do you?

36:36.514 --> 36:39.440
No. No, no. It's just me.

36:39.474 --> 36:40.909
Hmm.

36:40.942 --> 36:43.610
Yeah, it's pretty wild.

36:44.201 --> 36:46.180
Yeah, I should probably
go wrap things up

36:46.213 --> 36:47.614
so we can get out of your way.

36:47.648 --> 36:49.584
Of course. Do what you got to do.

37:08.703 --> 37:09.905
Jacob.

37:20.181 --> 37:22.151
- Jacob.
- Hmm?

37:22.717 --> 37:25.086
What? What I'd do?

37:26.721 --> 37:28.789
Oh, I'm sorry.

37:28.822 --> 37:30.925
I realized something last night.

37:34.862 --> 37:36.932
Our relationship as we know it...

37:39.490 --> 37:41.793
the relationship that we started...

37:45.139 --> 37:46.641
is dead.

37:48.208 --> 37:49.777
We need to get to help.

37:54.215 --> 37:58.786
Help like, uh... like what, therapy?

37:59.520 --> 38:00.654
Yes.

38:06.760 --> 38:08.128
I'm not going to therapy.

38:15.603 --> 38:16.694
I'm not.

38:43.931 --> 38:45.457
So, why didn't you tell me?

38:45.933 --> 38:47.273
At that age?

38:48.936 --> 38:50.761
You would have killed Mac,

38:51.105 --> 38:53.473
or said something, at the very least.

38:54.275 --> 38:56.244
I knew Daddy was set
to pay for your school.

38:56.277 --> 38:57.712
I didn't want to mess that up.

39:01.248 --> 39:02.684
So, I lied.

39:05.119 --> 39:07.856
I said we should be free
to see other people.

39:10.291 --> 39:12.595
That wasn't what I wanted to do,

39:14.762 --> 39:15.997
but I said it.

39:18.666 --> 39:20.501
You were right to be angry.

39:21.168 --> 39:23.373
What I was saying didn't make any sense.

39:24.704 --> 39:26.574
You didn't do anything wrong, Noah.

39:28.309 --> 39:29.578
I did.

39:33.847 --> 39:35.282
I'm so sorry.

39:41.688 --> 39:43.958
So, that's why you're here.
