00:16.350 --> 00:18.686
Bubbles:
Julian, we need to tell
him the fucking truth!

00:18.770 --> 00:21.146
We can't. Not yet.

00:21.230 --> 00:22.523
Well, the more
attached he becomes

00:22.607 --> 00:25.192
and the comfortable
he becomes around Lahey,

00:25.276 --> 00:27.194
the more pissed off
he's going to be
when he finds out

00:27.278 --> 00:29.363
we knew and we didn't
fucking tell him!

00:29.447 --> 00:32.031
Look, man, I'm not buying
this. Think about it.

00:32.116 --> 00:33.492
Why would it
take Lahey so long

00:33.576 --> 00:35.453
to fucking tell him
something like that, huh?

00:35.536 --> 00:37.079
I don't know, but...

00:37.162 --> 00:38.372
whether he's really
Ricky's father or not,

00:38.456 --> 00:41.083
he honestly fucking
believes that he is.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.501
He believes it!

00:42.585 --> 00:44.545
Do you think this
is a coincidence?

00:44.629 --> 00:46.547
Lahey broke up with Randy,
then gained Ricky's trust.

00:46.631 --> 00:47.882
Now, all of a sudden,

00:47.966 --> 00:49.634
they're one big
happy fucking family?

00:49.717 --> 00:51.218
Come on, man!

00:51.302 --> 00:53.554
Oh, I don't
know. Maybe.

00:53.638 --> 00:55.347
Nuh-uh. No way.

00:55.431 --> 00:57.934
Lahey's smart, Ricky's dumb,
and Lahey knows that.

00:58.017 --> 01:01.562
He's just fucking
tugging at his
heart-strings, man.

01:01.646 --> 01:04.105
Look how fucking sincere
he looks right now.

01:04.188 --> 01:06.567
Look at him.

01:06.651 --> 01:08.277
It's pretty fucking
brilliant, actually.

01:09.361 --> 01:11.238
Oh, fuck's sakes!

01:11.322 --> 01:12.740
Now you're getting me
all worked up,

01:12.824 --> 01:14.033
second-guessing
myself!

01:14.116 --> 01:15.326
Look, you've just
got to calm down.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.578
Lahey's smart,
but I'm smarter.

01:17.662 --> 01:18.955
We've just got to
harvest all that weed,

01:19.038 --> 01:20.205
get it out of
the rink by today.

01:20.289 --> 01:21.582
That's all
we've got to do.

01:21.666 --> 01:23.542
Oh is that all? Fuck!

01:23.626 --> 01:24.961
That's easy!

01:25.044 --> 01:26.420
Harvest a couple of
hundred weed plants

01:26.504 --> 01:28.756
and move them to a new
location undetected.

01:28.840 --> 01:31.258
Fuck, I can do
that by myself!

01:31.342 --> 01:34.720
I'm being sarcastic!

01:34.804 --> 01:37.348
(Theme music)

02:16.512 --> 02:18.389
Julian:
Hey, Ricky.

02:18.472 --> 02:21.517
Did you guys hear
something? 'Cause I
know I fucking didn't.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.227
It's Julian
talking, Ricky.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.896
How long are you going
to go without talking
to me?

02:24.979 --> 02:26.397
It's been a week.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.982
We've nothing to talk
about. I don't talk

02:28.066 --> 02:29.817
to fucking
Arnold Swarzenanegger
fucking imperforators

02:29.901 --> 02:31.360
trying to fucking ruin
other people's families

02:31.443 --> 02:33.529
'cause they're
fucking jealous!
Ricky!

02:33.612 --> 02:35.239
Ricky, don't be
like that. Come on.

02:35.322 --> 02:36.532
Rick...

02:36.615 --> 02:38.910
You're absolutely
right, man.

02:38.993 --> 02:40.912
I am jealous.

02:40.995 --> 02:42.162
I've never
had a dad before

02:42.246 --> 02:43.414
and you've had
two now.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.832
It hurts, man.
Oh, so what?

02:44.916 --> 02:46.333
You're just going to
fucking kill my new one?

02:46.417 --> 02:49.087
It wasn't supposed
to be crazy like that.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.588
Jesus, man.
Think about it.

02:50.671 --> 02:51.923
The bottle kids never
fucking hurt anybody

02:52.006 --> 02:53.507
like that before!
Bullshit!

02:53.591 --> 02:55.426
Randy fucking
said they told him

02:55.509 --> 02:57.511
that you said to keep
going until there
was fucking blood!

02:57.595 --> 03:00.806
What? I did not fucking
say that, Randy!

03:00.890 --> 03:02.307
Those kids must
be on chemicals

03:02.391 --> 03:04.643
or drugs or
something, man.

03:04.727 --> 03:06.270
(Sighing)

03:06.353 --> 03:08.522
Look, Jim...

03:08.606 --> 03:10.108
(Sighing)

03:10.190 --> 03:12.026
I'm sorry.

03:12.110 --> 03:13.318
You know,
I know we've had

03:13.402 --> 03:16.155
our differences
in the past.

03:16.238 --> 03:18.991
I just want you
to know that...

03:19.075 --> 03:21.994
I accept you
as Ricky's father.

03:22.078 --> 03:25.664
And I don't mean to
be jealous but I am.

03:25.748 --> 03:28.793
I've always looked up
to you all my life, man.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.669
It's just tough.

03:30.753 --> 03:32.546
It's awful big of you
to say so, Julian.

03:32.630 --> 03:34.966
It means a lot to me.

03:35.049 --> 03:36.717
And I know I can't
undo everything

03:36.801 --> 03:38.302
that's happened
in the past,

03:38.385 --> 03:41.139
and... I don't know...

03:41.221 --> 03:44.100
anything about fathers
and sons and...

03:44.183 --> 03:47.311
you know, 'cause
I've never had one before.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.271
But I know,
from what I've heard,

03:49.354 --> 03:51.857
they go golfing
together, so...

03:51.941 --> 03:54.068
I got you guys
these passes.

03:55.987 --> 03:57.237
Wow...

03:57.321 --> 03:59.239
And here, you guys
can use the Caddy.

03:59.323 --> 04:02.160
I topped it up
with gas.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.661
Well, I couldn't
go today.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.163
I got to look
at the plants

04:05.245 --> 04:06.497
and they're probably
ready for harvest.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.706
Ricky, we can
forget about it.

04:07.790 --> 04:09.541
It's just one day, man.

04:09.625 --> 04:11.502
What's important here
is that you guys

04:11.585 --> 04:14.338
have some
catching up to do.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.089
All right?

04:16.173 --> 04:17.591
Huh!

04:19.010 --> 04:21.095
I'm sorry, man.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.347
You really
mean that, Julian?

04:23.430 --> 04:24.556
Of course
I do, man.

04:24.640 --> 04:27.101
You guys are
my fucking brothers.

04:27.185 --> 04:28.352
Thanks, Julian.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.104
You're a good
fucking guy.

04:30.188 --> 04:31.856
You've earnt
my expect again.

04:31.939 --> 04:36.027
(Whistling)

04:36.110 --> 04:38.029
You okay, Bubs?
What are you doing?

04:38.112 --> 04:39.321
(Laughing)

04:39.404 --> 04:41.615
R2D2 trying to
get in on the love.

04:41.699 --> 04:43.701
Get in here, man.
I love you guys.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.536
I don't want to
be fighting, man.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.915
Golf, huh?

04:49.999 --> 04:51.542
It can't be that hard.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.877
(Bird squawking)

04:52.960 --> 04:54.336
Lahey:
Great to have you back, Ran.

04:54.419 --> 04:56.463
I'm really looking forward
to moving past all this

04:56.547 --> 05:00.051
and just being one big happy
family with everyone.

05:00.134 --> 05:02.261
Well,
not everyone.
What do you mean?

05:02.344 --> 05:03.637
Well, not Julian.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.098
Randy...

05:06.182 --> 05:10.435
that was a really
sincere apology, bud.

05:10.519 --> 05:13.231
You didn't actually
fall for that shit?

05:13.355 --> 05:14.565
After everything
he's done to you?

05:14.648 --> 05:15.983
I know, Randy,
but...

05:16.067 --> 05:17.651
let's not forget all
the horrible things

05:17.735 --> 05:18.903
I did to Julian.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.571
To all of them,
for that matter.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.780
It's not like
he tried

05:21.864 --> 05:23.866
to blow me up
with dynamite.

05:23.949 --> 05:25.993
I'm not letting
this go, if that's
what you think.

05:26.077 --> 05:27.745
Randy!

05:27.828 --> 05:29.371
You're never going
to be a cop.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.583
It's not about that.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.253
It's about standing up
and taking Julian down

05:35.335 --> 05:36.795
for everything
he's ever done to you.

05:36.879 --> 05:38.923
Randy, you're going
to drive yourself crazy.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.759
I'm telling you, bud!
He's sending you golfing

05:41.842 --> 05:43.094
for a reason.
Think about it.

05:43.177 --> 05:44.344
Don't waste your life

05:44.428 --> 05:46.555
chasing Julian around
like I did, Randy!

05:46.638 --> 05:49.308
I can't believe
you're falling
for his shit!

05:49.391 --> 05:51.102
This is what
he always does!

05:51.185 --> 05:53.187
People change, Randy.

05:53.271 --> 05:54.605
Look at me!

05:54.688 --> 05:56.148
I'm living proof!

05:56.232 --> 05:57.983
Randy:
I'm taking the
frigging car!

05:58.067 --> 06:00.069
(Chuckle)
(Door slamming)

06:00.152 --> 06:02.280
Hey, T,
listen up, man.
What's up, man?

06:02.362 --> 06:04.115
There's been
a change of plans.

06:04.198 --> 06:05.407
We've got to
harvest today.

06:05.490 --> 06:06.825
I'm going to need
all hands on deck, boys.

06:06.909 --> 06:08.160
Today?
Yeah, like,
right now.

06:08.244 --> 06:09.620
I can't see it, man.

06:09.703 --> 06:10.955
I got a two-hour
corporate gig

06:11.038 --> 06:12.164
booked in the T Box,

06:12.248 --> 06:13.457
plus phones
gotta get fixed.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.251
I got cards that
need to be programmed.

06:15.334 --> 06:17.169
Shit's too tight.
It's impossible.

06:17.253 --> 06:19.797
It's impossible.
Impossible.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.173
I'll give you
a half a pound
of weed.

06:21.257 --> 06:23.008
Done! Roc-Pile,
let's roll!

06:23.092 --> 06:24.802
Mr. Green, hold shit
down here, man.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.971
Hold it down.
What happened
to impossible?

06:27.054 --> 06:28.222
Shit, a half
a pound of weed

06:28.306 --> 06:29.640
will move mountains.
You know what it is.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.142
All right, see you
down at the rink, man.

06:31.225 --> 06:32.559
Cory, Jacob,
round up

06:32.643 --> 06:34.019
as many people from
the park as you can,

06:34.103 --> 06:35.479
meet us down at
the fucking rink.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.439
Okay, Julian.
All right.

06:37.522 --> 06:38.983
Let's go, man.
All right.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.235
(Loud music playing)

06:42.569 --> 06:43.988
Ricky:
I'll tell you right now,

06:44.071 --> 06:45.489
there's no fucking way
I'm calling Randy "Mom"

06:45.572 --> 06:47.491
or "Mother" or
"Dad Number Two".
Fuck that!

06:47.574 --> 06:49.660
Don't worry, Ricky,
that'll never be the case.

06:49.743 --> 06:50.953
This game
is so fucked.

06:51.036 --> 06:52.496
Why do we have to use
golf club sticks?

06:52.579 --> 06:55.166
I can't feel any one.
Rick... Who knows.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.793
Maybe you'll end up liking
the game. We can invite...

06:57.876 --> 07:00.296
Ricky!
For fuck's sake...
Sorry.

07:00.379 --> 07:01.755
Maybe we'll, uh...

07:01.839 --> 07:03.757
invite Jacob
and Randy along,

07:03.841 --> 07:05.009
have a foursome.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.344
Have a foursome?
Jacob and Randy?

07:06.426 --> 07:09.013
Dad, no offence,
but I only bang chicks.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.430
No...

07:10.514 --> 07:12.224
I'm not talk about
a sex party, Ricky.

07:12.308 --> 07:13.517
Foursome is
a word you use

07:13.600 --> 07:14.726
when four people
play golf.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.020
Oh, okay.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.063
Man:
You're all set, guys.

07:18.147 --> 07:19.731
The clubs will be on
the cart. Here's your key,

07:19.815 --> 07:21.192
and the locker rooms
are down to the right.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.235
Perfect.
Locker rooms? Why?

07:23.319 --> 07:25.445
Well, I assume
you're going to
change out of those.

07:25.529 --> 07:27.031
Well you fucking
assume wrong.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.532
Are you going to change?
What you're wearing

07:28.615 --> 07:30.326
is way more fucked
than what I'm wearing!

07:30.409 --> 07:32.203
You look like a
fucking candy cane
tarantula slut!

07:32.286 --> 07:34.830
Rick...
Sir, there are rules.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.498
I can't allow you
on the course
dressed like that.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.042
Really.
Okay, I get it.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.877
Well, I can't allow
you to fuck off and
lick my balls

07:39.960 --> 07:41.753
unless I ask you
to fuck off and
lick my balls.

07:41.837 --> 07:43.047
So...

07:43.130 --> 07:44.256
Can you fuck off
and lick my balls?

07:44.340 --> 07:45.716
Can you fucking
do that?

07:45.799 --> 07:47.051
Sir, that's not in
my job description.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.302
Well, fucking put it
in your job description,

07:48.386 --> 07:50.054
you little dick.
Rick...

07:50.137 --> 07:51.889
Hey, I'll take
care of it.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.724
Hm.
Lahey:
Ricky!

07:53.807 --> 07:55.100
What a dick...
Lahey:
Come on, bud!

07:55.184 --> 07:56.310
Julian:
All right, doing a great job.

07:56.394 --> 07:58.270
Less fluffing,
more cutting.

07:58.354 --> 08:00.231
Ma'am, you're
not cutting hair,
you're cutting weed.

08:00.314 --> 08:02.649
Doesn't have
to look pretty.

08:02.733 --> 08:04.402
Julian,
I'm sorry.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.904
We're just not strong
enough to cut these things.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.406
We can cut the buds

08:08.488 --> 08:09.781
but you can't cut
through these stalks.

08:09.865 --> 08:11.491
Yeah.
Okay, I'm sorry,
ladies.

08:11.575 --> 08:12.910
It is pretty tough.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.161
Roc-Pile, you guys
are going to have

08:14.245 --> 08:15.413
to double-time it
on the stalks.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.663
They can't cut
through it.

08:16.747 --> 08:18.123
This is what
you guys can do.

08:18.207 --> 08:19.583
You're going to be
the baggers, okay?

08:19.666 --> 08:21.085
You're going to
bag everything.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.586
Thank you. We'll try
our best, Julian.

08:22.669 --> 08:23.795
Thank you, ladies.

08:23.879 --> 08:25.589
It's all I ask for.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.966
Jacob.

08:28.050 --> 08:30.094
Jacob, get the
fuck over here.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.929
Do you think
you guys could
find some people

08:32.011 --> 08:33.597
that can actually
cut through a
fucking weed plant?

08:33.679 --> 08:35.099
Oh, that's not
our fault, dude.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.475
Everyone else
was at work.

08:36.558 --> 08:37.808
The oldies are
the only one around

08:37.893 --> 08:39.644
during the daytime.
Yeah, exactly.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.480
You guys are so
fucking stupid!

08:41.563 --> 08:42.981
We got to pick up
the pace here, man.

08:43.065 --> 08:44.816
What, are you
fucking crazy?

08:44.900 --> 08:46.818
You're going to
threaten the oldies
with a handgun?

08:46.902 --> 08:48.153
I'm not going
to threaten them.

08:48.237 --> 08:49.447
Just going to wave
it around a bit,

08:49.529 --> 08:51.115
maybe fire one off
in the air, man.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.158
Just get the
adrenaline going.
Picking it up.

08:53.242 --> 08:54.452
You're not getting
their fucking
adrenaline going!

08:54.534 --> 08:55.911
You get their
adrenaline going

08:55.994 --> 08:57.288
and their fucking
hearts gonna explode!

08:57.371 --> 08:59.039
They're old as
the hills, Julian!

08:59.123 --> 09:00.374
All right, okay.

09:00.458 --> 09:02.126
Respect your fucking...
Look at me.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.002
What?
Respect your elders.

09:04.086 --> 09:05.963
I do! Okay?

09:06.046 --> 09:07.465
All right, listen up,
everybody.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.174
I know everyone's
working really hard

09:09.258 --> 09:10.675
but, if we're going
to pull this off,

09:10.759 --> 09:13.011
you've got to pick up
the fucking pace for me.

09:13.095 --> 09:14.972
Okay? All right.
Thank you very much.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.181
Put it away!

09:16.265 --> 09:17.475
I put the safety...
(Gunshot)

09:17.557 --> 09:18.683
(Screams)

09:18.767 --> 09:20.644
Jesus Murphy!
Oh-h-h!

09:20.727 --> 09:22.020
It's okay, everybody!

09:22.104 --> 09:23.814
It's okay. Remain calm.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.317
That was just a
very loud pellet gun

09:26.400 --> 09:27.818
and it will
not happen again.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.529
Try to keep your heart
rates down, please.

09:30.612 --> 09:33.157
I was...
You're a fucking
asshole!

09:33.240 --> 09:34.783
I was just putting
the safety on.

09:34.866 --> 09:36.827
Oh yeah, just
putting the safe...

09:36.910 --> 09:38.162
Who are you,
Cyrus now?

09:38.245 --> 09:40.038
Aw jeez, don't you
ever call me Cyrus.

09:40.122 --> 09:41.540
Well, stop acting
like him!

09:41.623 --> 09:43.041
Well, start
working then!

09:43.125 --> 09:44.751
I am working!

09:44.835 --> 09:46.170
What are you doing,

09:46.253 --> 09:47.671
walking around fucking
scaring people?

09:47.754 --> 09:49.047
Getting bags.
I'm working.

09:49.131 --> 09:50.341
What the fuck are
you doing, nothing.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.843
I'm taking fucking...

09:52.926 --> 09:54.178
inventory.

09:55.846 --> 09:57.556
Lahey:
Bounced off that
tree right there.

09:57.639 --> 09:59.891
I thought
the little fucking
idiot was right here.

09:59.975 --> 10:01.519
I can't believe
this costs 200 bucks!

10:01.601 --> 10:05.397
I look like a...
(Screaming) fucking dick!

10:05.481 --> 10:07.566
There's
the little fuckface.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.026
Get out the way then,
you fucking idiot.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.069
Woah, woah, woah, woah!
Green's over this way.

10:11.153 --> 10:13.989
This way?
Yeah. Keep it low,
under there.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.077
(Thud)
Fuck off.

10:19.161 --> 10:21.205
Just remember...
Look, stand...

10:21.288 --> 10:22.873
trunk up...
Yeah. Nice and easy.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.875
Okay.
Just relax,
just relax.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.960
I'm relaxed.
I feel good, Dad.

10:27.044 --> 10:28.879
(Exhales)

10:28.962 --> 10:32.216
(Thuds)

10:32.299 --> 10:35.052
Why are you such
a stupid fucking
cocksucker!

10:35.135 --> 10:36.303
Guys!

10:36.387 --> 10:38.722
This is taking
a real long time.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.057
Can we play
through?

10:40.140 --> 10:41.475
Through?

10:41.559 --> 10:43.101
What the fuck kind
of a game is through?

10:43.185 --> 10:45.062
Right now I'm trying
to play golf, so why
don't you fuck off

10:45.145 --> 10:47.022
'cause I'm trying
to concentrate!
You can play through

10:47.105 --> 10:49.816
when we're fucking
done with golf,
dickhead!

10:49.900 --> 10:51.318
(Engine stopping)
Great...

10:51.402 --> 10:52.819
These are the gentlemen
that used the passes

10:52.903 --> 10:54.405
right here, Chief.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.407
Why am I not
surprised?

10:56.490 --> 10:57.741
Jim. Rick.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.951
You guys dating now?

11:00.035 --> 11:01.245
Actually, George,

11:01.328 --> 11:03.247
Ricky's my son.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.290
I never told him.

11:05.374 --> 11:07.585
Really? Wow.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.628
Wish I'd known
that one years ago.

11:09.711 --> 11:12.339
What the fuck
do you want?

11:12.423 --> 11:13.591
Well, Rick,

11:13.673 --> 11:15.133
the passes you guys
used here today

11:15.217 --> 11:17.261
came from the glove
compartment of my truck,

11:17.344 --> 11:19.263
which was stolen.
Fuck...

11:19.346 --> 11:20.680
I told them to
give me a call

11:20.764 --> 11:22.974
if anybody was ever
dumb enough to use them,

11:23.058 --> 11:24.602
(Chuckling)
and here you are.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.104
George, I didn't steal
your fucking truck.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.939
George:
Oh, I know you
didn't. Julian did.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.357
But you are
in possession

11:30.441 --> 11:31.609
of stolen property
now, aren't you?

11:31.691 --> 11:32.984
No, actually, I'm not.

11:33.068 --> 11:34.319
I'm in possession
of two golf passes

11:34.403 --> 11:36.238
I bought at the fucking
flea market.

11:36.321 --> 11:38.115
So why don't
you go down there
and try to figure out

11:38.198 --> 11:40.117
who the fuck sold
them to me instead
of standing here

11:40.200 --> 11:41.452
blowing fucking
super-dick shit-smoke
up our fucking asses?

11:41.535 --> 11:44.371
George, you have no
evidence. You know it.

11:44.455 --> 11:46.498
Shut the fuck up, Jim.

11:46.582 --> 11:47.791
I've got enough

11:47.874 --> 11:49.084
to drag you both
down to the station

11:49.167 --> 11:50.794
and make you sit there
all day in the heat

11:50.877 --> 11:53.171
until someone's
ready to see you.
Come on, let's go.

11:53.255 --> 11:54.632
My fuck, you're
a dick, George.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.508
Actually you're
more than a dick,

11:56.592 --> 11:57.842
you're fucking
king and lord of
the fucking dicks!

11:57.926 --> 11:59.219
George, we're just
trying to have

11:59.303 --> 12:01.221
a real nice quiet
game of golf here.

12:01.305 --> 12:02.514
Look...

12:02.598 --> 12:03.807
What's it
going to take

12:03.890 --> 12:05.100
for you to
just walk away?

12:06.935 --> 12:08.687
What have you got
in your pockets?

12:08.770 --> 12:09.980
Unbelievable.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.523
As usual...

12:11.607 --> 12:14.485
I've got $35.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.987
Hm! Sweet.
That's more
than I paid

12:17.070 --> 12:18.822
for the tickets at
the charity auction.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.157
Good,
you're happy?

12:20.240 --> 12:21.450
Good. Both of you,
fuck off, then!

12:21.533 --> 12:23.535
Sir, I will let you
finish the ninth hole,

12:23.619 --> 12:25.496
but you have to stop
with the yelling
and swearing.

12:25.579 --> 12:26.997
I can do that.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.457
Can I still do this,
though, fuckhead?

12:28.540 --> 12:30.750
This fucking game
can suck my cock!

12:30.834 --> 12:32.503
Good one, Rick.

12:35.046 --> 12:36.923
Julian:
This is a goddamn
fucking nightmare.

12:37.007 --> 12:38.883
Oh, I know it is.
Do you think I
don't know that?

12:38.967 --> 12:40.594
Would you stop
fucking poking me
with those things?

12:40.678 --> 12:42.513
Why don't you
try downsizing
the pythons?

12:42.596 --> 12:44.055
Why don't you
fuck off?

12:44.139 --> 12:45.724
Bubbles:
Oh, my God.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.518
Um... Hey, kids!

12:47.601 --> 12:50.020
Um... there's no
hockey school today.

12:50.103 --> 12:53.231
I guess somebody
failed to mention that
to you, did they?

12:53.315 --> 12:55.233
Oh, man, you guys are
harvesting without us.

12:55.317 --> 12:57.861
Ricky said that
was the funnest part.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.530
Did he tell you
how to do it?

12:59.613 --> 13:01.072
Julian!

13:01.156 --> 13:03.534
My God, you guys were
helping Ricky with this?

13:03.617 --> 13:05.369
We grew
most of it.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.538
Who do you think
been feeding
the fucking things?

13:07.621 --> 13:10.290
Yeah, dummy.
My God!

13:10.374 --> 13:13.335
Okay, kids, I want
you to get into
groups of two, okay?

13:13.418 --> 13:14.878
No fucking way,
Julian!

13:14.961 --> 13:16.630
Bubs, what other
choice do we have?

13:16.714 --> 13:18.089
We have a choice!

13:18.173 --> 13:19.758
And you better
think hard about
making it, too,

13:19.841 --> 13:21.926
because these are
the kind of choices

13:22.010 --> 13:23.637
that reveal your
true character, bud.

13:23.721 --> 13:25.930
Bubs, things could
get more and more
complicated, okay?

13:26.014 --> 13:27.391
When things get
more complicated,

13:27.474 --> 13:29.601
there's greater and
greater risks involved.

13:29.685 --> 13:31.603
I swear to fuck
the more storybooks
you read,

13:31.687 --> 13:33.438
the more fucked in
the head you sound!

13:33.522 --> 13:35.106
You've got to remember
why we're doing this!

13:35.190 --> 13:37.067
You want to live
on the ocean
on that piece of land

13:37.150 --> 13:38.402
as a family?
Huh? Do you?

13:38.485 --> 13:39.861
Oh, you're going to try
this again?

13:39.944 --> 13:41.112
I know what
you're doing.

13:41.196 --> 13:42.781
Do you or
don't you?

13:42.864 --> 13:44.074
Yes.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.409
All right,
let's do this then.

13:45.492 --> 13:48.078
Just wait. We'll do
it on one condition.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.038
We'll do it
on one condition.

13:50.121 --> 13:52.082
You look into
the camera,

13:52.165 --> 13:53.667
Julian, and you say

13:53.751 --> 13:55.627
that the kids had
nothing to do with this.

13:55.711 --> 13:57.588
Are you fucking
kidding me?

13:57.671 --> 13:59.464
That's the only way
it's happening.
Right, kids?

13:59.548 --> 14:00.965
Kids:
Do it, Julian! Do it! Do it!

14:01.049 --> 14:02.259
All right, all right,
all right!

14:02.342 --> 14:03.510
I'll do it.

14:03.594 --> 14:04.762
(Sighing)

14:04.844 --> 14:06.054
Hi, I'm Julian.

14:06.137 --> 14:07.431
And if you're
watching this

14:07.514 --> 14:09.349
at the police station
right now, I was busted.

14:09.433 --> 14:11.309
I just want to make it very
clear that if there was children

14:11.393 --> 14:13.311
or senior citizens
involved as well,

14:13.395 --> 14:15.021
they weren't involved, okay?

14:15.105 --> 14:17.441
Don't arrest them.
I manipulated everybody.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.692
Okay, is that cool?

14:18.776 --> 14:20.193
(Stage whisper)
At gunpoint.

14:20.277 --> 14:23.447
At gunpoint. It was
all me and Ricky and...

14:23.530 --> 14:25.156
Oh, and Jim Lahey
and Randy, as well.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.950
They were involved too.
Okay, are we good?

14:27.033 --> 14:28.368
(Stage whisper)
And your best
friend Bubbles

14:28.452 --> 14:30.704
had nothing
to do with it.
(Sighing)

14:30.788 --> 14:32.456
And my best friend
in the world, Bubbles,

14:32.539 --> 14:34.750
had nothing to do
with this entire thing.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.460
He warned me
not to do it,
said it was stupid,

14:36.543 --> 14:38.295
I did it anyway,
look what happened.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.004
Okay, are
we good now?

14:40.088 --> 14:42.173
I believe that
will suffice, yes.

14:42.257 --> 14:43.592
All right, gang,
ready to do this?

14:43.675 --> 14:44.843
Kids:
Yeah!

14:44.926 --> 14:46.303
Okay, grab the clippers
from the oldies

14:46.386 --> 14:47.596
and let's start hacking
down some plants!

14:47.679 --> 14:49.139
Let's go!
Kids:
Yeah!

14:49.222 --> 14:50.515
Woo!

14:52.309 --> 14:54.352
Sweet Jesus,
what have we done?

14:56.563 --> 14:58.064
Man:
This is bullshit.

14:58.148 --> 14:59.316
Oh, look, dude.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.067
I normally have someone
here helping me

15:01.151 --> 15:02.653
and I am sorry,
and...

15:02.736 --> 15:04.154
We paid good money,
we're not even fucked up.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.156
Are you guys fucked up?
I'm not fucked up.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.659
Yo, man, I'm sorry.
I apologize for
everything.

15:08.742 --> 15:11.911
I would have smoked a joint
at the office if I knew this was
all it was going to be.

15:11.995 --> 15:13.997
We thought we were going
to get really fucked up!

15:14.080 --> 15:16.374
And I'm not fucked up!
And they're not fucked up!

15:16.458 --> 15:18.585
I'm getting filmed
and we're not fucked up!

15:18.669 --> 15:19.753
Yo, man,
calm down.

15:19.837 --> 15:21.421
Let me see what
I can do for you guys.

15:21.505 --> 15:23.256
All right?
Calm down. Hold on.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.217
(Remote phone ringing)

15:26.301 --> 15:27.845
Yo, T.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.848
Yeah, man, I can't hotbox
this thing by myself.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.684
Yeah, man, the clients
are over here pissed off.

15:33.767 --> 15:34.934
Tyrone:
Stop being a pussy.

15:35.018 --> 15:36.311
Put some muscle
into it.

15:36.394 --> 15:37.521
Tyrone:
Get smoking and get down here.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.022
The shit's ready to go.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.691
What?

15:40.774 --> 15:42.567
No...

15:42.651 --> 15:44.194
For real?
A'ight, a'ight.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.987
Just hold it down,
man, hold it down.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.238
What's going on?

15:47.322 --> 15:48.740
Mr. Green has
everything fucked.

15:48.824 --> 15:50.200
He ain't coming.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.869
No, no, no, no, no, no,
you call him back,

15:51.951 --> 15:53.871
we need that fucking
bus right now, man!

15:53.953 --> 15:55.246
Look, I can't
do it, dawg.

15:55.330 --> 15:56.874
That corporate gig
is with a law firm.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.375
Bitches is threatening
to shut me down!

15:58.458 --> 15:59.626
For fuck's
sakes, T!

15:59.710 --> 16:01.044
Well, you're only
getting paid

16:01.127 --> 16:02.420
a quarter pound
of weed now, okay?
What?

16:02.504 --> 16:04.381
The other quarter
was for the fucking bus,

16:04.464 --> 16:07.091
which I don't have!
F... A'ight, a'ight.

16:07.175 --> 16:08.719
I need to use
your truck, buddy.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.387
Oh, we're going to use
my truck to haul weed

16:10.470 --> 16:12.055
all over fucking town?
That's great!

16:12.138 --> 16:13.724
Man:
Hey, guys.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.392
I'm looking for someone
named Ricky. Is that you?

16:15.475 --> 16:16.601
There's no Ricky
here, man.

16:16.685 --> 16:18.019
Who the fuck
are you?

16:18.102 --> 16:20.063
Oh... my God,
that's...

16:20.146 --> 16:21.815
that's
Nathan MacKinnon!

16:21.899 --> 16:23.066
Kid:
Holy fuck!

16:23.149 --> 16:24.526
Oh, my God!
(Hyperventilating)

16:24.609 --> 16:26.945
Drafted first overall
rookie of the year!

16:27.028 --> 16:28.446
I'm having
a meltdown, Julian!

16:28.530 --> 16:30.782
Calm, calm the fuck...
It's Nathan MacKinnon!

16:30.866 --> 16:32.576
Please calm
the fuck down!
He's right there.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.077
All right, you're
<i>the</i> Nathan MacKinnon,

16:34.160 --> 16:36.246
the guy that plays
fucking professional
hockey?

16:36.329 --> 16:38.206
No, Julian. I'm shitting
in my underwear

16:38.289 --> 16:40.751
'cause it's a fucking
impostor Nathan MacKinnon.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.502
You actually showed up
for Ricky's hockey school?

16:42.586 --> 16:44.588
Right on, man.
Ah, no. Look.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.089
I found these
all over town.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.340
The other guys
are pissed off

16:47.424 --> 16:48.592
that their names
are on this too.

16:48.675 --> 16:49.843
Where is
this Ricky guy?

16:49.927 --> 16:51.219
My lawyer needs
to talk to him.

16:51.302 --> 16:52.888
Look, man. I'm
the garbage man here,

16:52.971 --> 16:55.766
and I don't even
know this fucking
Ricky guy, but...

16:55.849 --> 16:57.308
now that you're here,
man, I mean,

16:57.392 --> 16:58.643
the kids know
you're here.

16:58.727 --> 16:59.937
You're going to look
like a fucking dick

17:00.019 --> 17:01.605
if you don't hang out
with them, right?

17:01.688 --> 17:03.231
Well obviously
I'm going to play
hockey with the kids.

17:03.314 --> 17:04.441
Kids:
Yes-s-s.
All right.

17:04.523 --> 17:05.817
Decent.
Can I play too?

17:05.901 --> 17:07.986
No. We'll just stick
with the kids, bud.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.654
Hey, guys,
this isn't cool.

17:09.738 --> 17:10.906
I know. I agree.

17:10.989 --> 17:12.156
Let's go play
hockey, guys!

17:12.240 --> 17:15.911
Kids:
(Cheering)

17:19.705 --> 17:22.208
You okay?
Yeah. I'm just
freaking out.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.627
All right, is all
the weed out of there?
It is.

17:24.711 --> 17:25.963
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.714
Did I actually
shit myself?

17:29.048 --> 17:30.926
Nope.

17:31.009 --> 17:32.469
Ricky:
Well, this is the first
time I've played.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.304
You should be able
to hit a few people

17:34.387 --> 17:35.889
without fucking people
getting pissed off.
Barmaid: Hey.

17:35.973 --> 17:37.307
Hey.
What can I get
for you?

17:37.390 --> 17:39.977
Oh, two beers, please.
Whatever that is.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.185
Beers?

17:41.269 --> 17:43.981
Yeah. The first
beers with my son.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.857
Something a father
always looks forward to.

17:45.941 --> 17:47.150
Barmaid:
Are you guys members?

17:47.233 --> 17:48.359
Here we go again!

17:48.443 --> 17:49.653
Maybe we are,
maybe we aren't.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.029
What the fuck's
it to you?

17:51.112 --> 17:52.739
Well, you get
a discount on drinks.

17:52.823 --> 17:54.866
Ooh, discounts!
Fucking weirdos.

17:54.950 --> 17:56.994
Barmaid:
I'll take that as a no.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.996
Oh, Jesus. Why
does everybody here

17:59.078 --> 18:00.914
got a fucking bottle
of dick juice rammed
up their ass?

18:00.998 --> 18:02.457
Rick...
You know what?

18:02.540 --> 18:04.001
When this deal's
done, I might join
this fucking place.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.335
Then we'll see
what's up around here.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.753
Rick.

18:06.837 --> 18:08.964
When are you going
to let all that go?

18:09.047 --> 18:10.381
Mo's going to be
awful unhappy

18:10.465 --> 18:12.592
if you're not
around.

18:12.676 --> 18:14.052
The deal's almost done.

18:14.135 --> 18:16.429
Snoop's sending
his main guy,
Sammy Ogea.

18:16.513 --> 18:18.015
That'll be it,
it'll be over.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.808
Snoop...

18:19.891 --> 18:22.226
Is that the guy
who spray-painted
me last year?

18:22.310 --> 18:24.354
(Chuckling)
Yeah, that was fucked.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.272
I'm going to make
a lot of money, Dad.

18:26.356 --> 18:27.816
Uh... thank you.

18:30.276 --> 18:31.444
Thank you.

18:35.032 --> 18:36.240
Are you sure
this is okay?

18:36.324 --> 18:37.701
I mean, I don't want
to be responsible

18:37.784 --> 18:38.910
for getting you back
on the liquor...
Ah!

18:38.994 --> 18:40.203
I don't
have a problem

18:40.286 --> 18:41.412
with alcohol
anymore, Ricky.

18:41.496 --> 18:42.706
Honestly.

18:42.789 --> 18:43.957
You know, I realized
my drinking

18:44.041 --> 18:47.210
was filling a void.

18:47.293 --> 18:50.547
Yeah, but Mo
changed all that.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.383
You know,
it's easy quitting

18:53.466 --> 18:54.885
when you're not
quitting for yourself,

18:54.968 --> 18:57.012
when you have
someone to quit for.

18:57.095 --> 18:58.304
You know, I already
had one kid

18:58.388 --> 18:59.973
who won't talk to me
because of liquor.

19:00.057 --> 19:04.061
I don't need a
great-grandson who won't.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.312
To Mo,
my guardian angel.

19:06.396 --> 19:07.480
To Mo.

19:07.564 --> 19:09.273
(Cellphone ringing)

19:09.357 --> 19:10.650
(Sighing)

19:14.320 --> 19:15.446
Yeah, Ran?

19:17.490 --> 19:18.825
Randy, there could
be anything

19:18.909 --> 19:21.078
in those garbage bags,
including garbage.

19:22.746 --> 19:24.831
Ran, I told you.
Leave Julian alone.

19:24.915 --> 19:27.250
Listen, I've got
to go now, okay?

19:27.333 --> 19:29.044
Bye.

19:29.127 --> 19:30.253
The fuck's going on?

19:30.336 --> 19:32.089
Ugh, Randy's
on to Julian,

19:32.171 --> 19:33.965
whatever's happening
down at the rink.

19:34.049 --> 19:35.258
Look, I've been
trying to tell him.

19:35.341 --> 19:36.927
I said,
"Randy, drop it."

19:37.010 --> 19:38.678
But I can't control him
ever since he's been

19:38.762 --> 19:41.098
on that "Well, I want
to be a cop" kick.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.434
You know, Randy's
only half as dumb
as people think.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.937
What the fuck
was he talking
with garbage bags?

19:47.020 --> 19:48.479
Oh, he saw Julian

19:48.563 --> 19:50.523
taking garbage bags
out of the rink.

19:53.234 --> 19:55.612
Oh my fucking God!

19:55.695 --> 19:57.072
Lahey:
What?

19:57.155 --> 19:59.157
That fucking prick!
He's fucking me!

19:59.240 --> 20:00.450
We've got to go!

20:04.621 --> 20:06.539
Future officer Randy here.

20:06.623 --> 20:08.875
Suspects are now
moving northbound.

20:08.959 --> 20:10.127
Suspected contraband

20:10.209 --> 20:12.295
is being moved
to a new location.

20:12.378 --> 20:14.547
That's the suspects'
truck right there.

20:14.631 --> 20:17.968
(Sticks tapping)

20:18.051 --> 20:19.177
(Impact)

20:19.260 --> 20:20.428
Fuck you!

20:25.224 --> 20:26.350
Oh my fuck...

20:26.434 --> 20:28.145
Oh my fucking God!

20:28.227 --> 20:29.520
What the fuck
is going on here?

20:29.604 --> 20:30.981
Julian wouldn't
take all my weed!

20:31.064 --> 20:32.273
Kid:
Him and Bubbles
took it all.

20:32.356 --> 20:33.483
You just missed them!

20:33.566 --> 20:34.901
What?

20:34.985 --> 20:36.486
Who the fuck
are you?

20:36.569 --> 20:37.988
That's
Nathan MacKinnon,
you dumbass.

20:38.071 --> 20:40.073
My God, you are so
braindead sometimes,

20:40.157 --> 20:41.365
it's amazing.

20:41.449 --> 20:42.659
Sorry, man, I didn't
recognize you.

20:42.742 --> 20:43.994
Is your name Ricky?

20:44.077 --> 20:46.329
No! No, I'm, uh...
Cory Trevorson.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.706
This is my
father Jacob.

20:48.790 --> 20:50.667
Jacob Trevorson.
Nice to meet you.

20:50.750 --> 20:51.918
What's this talk
about weed?

20:52.002 --> 20:53.461
Are you guys
growing weed in here?

20:53.544 --> 20:56.047
No! No, we're growing
some tulips and daisies

20:56.131 --> 20:57.924
for the big upcoming
flower show...

20:58.008 --> 21:00.259
Kids:
Oh, come on!

21:00.343 --> 21:01.678
Well, they got
fucked over by weeds

21:01.761 --> 21:03.013
and we were
taking weeds...

21:03.096 --> 21:04.347
It's just a lot of
weed talk basically.

21:04.430 --> 21:05.556
Great to meet you,
you're awesome.

21:05.640 --> 21:06.933
Keep it up, kids.
We'll see you soon,

21:07.017 --> 21:08.143
all right?
We've got to run.

21:08.226 --> 21:09.519
Is this guy
growing weed in here?

21:09.602 --> 21:11.521
Kids:
Yeah. Big time.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.023
Look, I can't be around
this kind of thing

21:13.106 --> 21:14.524
and neither
should you.

21:14.607 --> 21:15.859
It's not like
we were smoking it.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.068
We were just
growing it.

21:17.152 --> 21:18.569
And harvesting it.

21:18.653 --> 21:19.863
Nathan:
If you guys do drugs,

21:19.946 --> 21:21.572
you can't do tricks
like this.

21:25.827 --> 21:26.995
(Slapshot)

21:27.078 --> 21:29.288
Kids:
Whoa-a-a-a...

21:30.456 --> 21:32.291
Rick, there
is probably

21:32.375 --> 21:33.626
a reasonable
explanation.

21:33.710 --> 21:35.545
So just try to stay
calm. Okay, son?

21:35.628 --> 21:38.381
All right, Dad.
I'll fucking try to.

21:41.134 --> 21:42.468
(Car doors slamming)

21:42.552 --> 21:43.720
Ricky:
How's it going?

21:43.803 --> 21:45.055
Julian:
Hey, guys.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.264
Ricky:
How are my two best friends

21:46.347 --> 21:47.891
on such a beautiful
fucking day?

21:47.974 --> 21:49.809
Doing good.
Where did you
get the shirt?

21:49.893 --> 21:51.186
Boys...

21:51.269 --> 21:52.812
After all we've
fucking been through,

21:52.896 --> 21:54.564
how in the fuck
could you...
do this to me?

21:54.647 --> 21:55.857
(Screaming)
Open up that
container right now

21:55.940 --> 21:57.400
and give me back
my fucking weed!

21:57.483 --> 21:59.569
You get rid of him and
I'll fucking explain

21:59.652 --> 22:00.737
everything
to you, man.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.072
My dad's not
going anywhere.

22:02.155 --> 22:04.782
Open the fucking
container now!

22:04.866 --> 22:06.910
Ricky, just
calm down.
Not happening.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.286
Oh, not
happening?

22:08.369 --> 22:10.080
Really?
Not happening?
(Gun click)

22:10.163 --> 22:11.664
Oh, it's fucking
happening, all right!

22:11.748 --> 22:13.541
Open the container now.
You've got four seconds!

22:13.624 --> 22:15.126
Oh come on,
guys!
Three...

22:15.210 --> 22:16.961
Do you really want
to do this?
...two, one...

22:17.045 --> 22:18.922
Is this how you
want to do this?
Yeah!

22:19.005 --> 22:20.757
I'm not going to stand
here getting fucking
raped in the mouth,

22:20.840 --> 22:21.966
so fucking open
the container now!

22:22.050 --> 22:23.260
Nobody's raping
your mouth!

22:23.342 --> 22:24.761
Boys, put
your guns down!

22:24.844 --> 22:27.097
Everybody, put your
frigging guns down now!

22:27.180 --> 22:28.890
I'm making a
citizen's arrest!

22:28.973 --> 22:31.101
What the fuck is
wrong with your
brain, Randy, huh?

22:31.184 --> 22:32.685
You're making
a citizen's arrest

22:32.769 --> 22:34.271
for me shoving a pole
right up your fucking ass?

22:34.353 --> 22:36.439
No, for all
the marijuana
Julian's got

22:36.522 --> 22:38.316
in that container
right there.

22:38.399 --> 22:39.650
I have no idea
what the fuck

22:39.734 --> 22:41.069
you guys are
talking about.

22:41.152 --> 22:43.280
Oh, yeah?
Look at this.

22:45.615 --> 22:46.783
I missed garbage
collection.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.034
It's a bunch of
fucking garbage.

22:48.118 --> 22:49.953
Woop-dee-shit!

22:50.036 --> 22:52.330
You fucking prick...

22:52.413 --> 22:54.165
I fucking loved you guys
like fucking brothers

22:54.249 --> 22:55.458
and this is what
you do to me?

22:55.541 --> 22:56.667
You fuck me
this hard?

22:56.751 --> 22:57.961
Ricky, nobody's
fucking you hard

22:58.044 --> 22:59.254
or soft or
any other way.

22:59.337 --> 23:00.797
You know what?
You guys gonna fuck me?

23:00.880 --> 23:03.382
Maybe I'll fuck you.
Dad, Randy?

23:03.466 --> 23:05.135
How would you guys
like to make 50 grand?

23:05.218 --> 23:07.511
I'd do anything
for you, Rick.
50 grand!

23:07.595 --> 23:09.222
What are you
talking about?

23:09.306 --> 23:11.308
Look, I would do
anything for you, man,

23:11.390 --> 23:12.976
but if you're going to
choose Randy and Lahey

23:13.059 --> 23:14.602
over me and him,

23:14.685 --> 23:16.313
you've got to fucking
come through me, buddy.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.981
So be it. You
try to cut me out,

23:18.064 --> 23:19.899
then I'll fucking
cut you out.
Is that right?

23:19.983 --> 23:21.151
I'll fucking
shoot you, Julian.

23:21.234 --> 23:22.401
I'll fucking shoot you!

23:22.485 --> 23:23.820
(Mixed yelling)

23:23.903 --> 23:26.197
Open that fucking
container now!

23:26.281 --> 23:28.116
Open that fucking
container!

23:28.199 --> 23:29.326
There's something
we've got to tell
you, Ricky!

23:29.408 --> 23:30.660
What have you got
to tell me, Bubs?

23:30.743 --> 23:32.120
We should have
told you long ago.

23:32.203 --> 23:34.747
You better
fucking tell me...
(Mixed shouts)

23:34.831 --> 23:36.749
Tell me right now or
I'm shooting him anyway!

23:36.833 --> 23:39.002
Ricky, Listen!
Lahey's not your father!

23:39.085 --> 23:41.004
What the fuck are
you talking about?
Bullshit, Bubbles!

23:41.087 --> 23:42.588
Don't start
with that...
He's not!

23:42.672 --> 23:44.799
That's a bunch of
fucking bullshit, Bubbles!

23:44.882 --> 23:48.678
Ricky's my son!
No, he's not, Mr. Lahey.
I'm sorry. He's not.

23:48.761 --> 23:52.265
We went and had
the blood checked
and it's not possible.

23:52.349 --> 23:54.058
What do you mean, you
had the blood checked?

23:54.142 --> 23:57.561
Look, Ricky.
We found out your
mother's blood type.

23:57.645 --> 24:00.023
How?
We went to
the hospital

24:00.106 --> 24:04.235
and you're Type B
and she's Type A,
and what type are you?

24:04.319 --> 24:06.196
O.
Exactly.

24:06.279 --> 24:07.905
Well, what the fuck
does that mean?

24:07.989 --> 24:11.117
Look, summary
with Type O blood:

24:11.201 --> 24:13.828
can't have a child
with Type B.

24:13.911 --> 24:16.164
It's impossible.
I'm sorry, guys.

24:16.247 --> 24:17.623
This can't be.

24:17.707 --> 24:19.792
(Panicked panting)

24:19.876 --> 24:21.252
Bubbles:
Ricky, come
here. Ricky...

24:21.336 --> 24:23.713
No, fuck off!
Ricky!

24:23.796 --> 24:25.548
(Sighing)
Oh, my God!

24:25.631 --> 24:27.884
Are you okay,
Mr. Lahey?
What?

24:27.967 --> 24:30.387
I've got hand it
to you, Lahey.

24:30.469 --> 24:33.056
Great fucking
performance, buddy.
Julian...

24:33.139 --> 24:36.393
You didn't have me
fucking fooled, though!
Julian.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.686
Get the fuck
off my property.

24:38.769 --> 24:41.939
That wasn't a
frigging performance,
Julian, you big meanie.

24:42.023 --> 24:44.108
Oh, go fuck
yourself, Randy.

24:45.902 --> 24:49.739
My fuck... This is
fucked. Poor Ricky.

24:49.822 --> 24:52.700
Well, at least he knows
now, okay? He'll be all
right. He'll get over it.

24:52.783 --> 24:54.577
Oh, he'll get over it?
Yeah.

24:54.660 --> 24:57.288
Is he going to get over
when we tell him
Ray's not his dad?

24:57.372 --> 24:59.582
We are not telling
him that.
We have to!

24:59.665 --> 25:02.419
No, we're not
telling him!

25:02.501 --> 25:06.630
All right. Let's
get some food, go
get some more booze

25:06.714 --> 25:09.759
and figure out how
the fuck we're going
to finish this. Come on.

25:11.844 --> 25:14.138
Can you stop filming me?

25:19.936 --> 25:22.105
Julian: Ricky!
Bubbles: Rick!

25:22.188 --> 25:23.981
He must be
in his room.

25:24.065 --> 25:26.192
He wouldn't be
in his fucking room.

25:26.276 --> 25:28.069
(Knocking on wall)
Come out.

25:29.404 --> 25:30.863
Hey, Rick.

25:30.947 --> 25:32.490
Look, man, we've got to talk
about this weed, buddy.

25:32.573 --> 25:34.117
Julian.
What?

25:34.200 --> 25:36.286
(In low voice)
Just... chill out.

25:36.369 --> 25:40.123
How're you doing, Ricky?
Who's got your belly?

25:40.206 --> 25:42.750
I'm okay, I guess.

25:42.833 --> 25:44.710
It's just... well...

25:44.794 --> 25:48.547
I was kind of liking having
a dad in my lives again.

25:48.631 --> 25:51.801
I was actually kind of
starting to like the guy.

25:51.884 --> 25:54.804
But the person I feel
the worst for is Mo.

25:54.887 --> 25:58.141
I mean...
Mo fucking loves him.

25:58.224 --> 26:00.851
He does, Ricky,
but you know what?

26:00.935 --> 26:02.812
You've just got to remember
he's only three,

26:02.895 --> 26:05.315
so that's... the
important thing.

26:05.398 --> 26:07.817
What the fuck does that
have to do with anything?

26:07.900 --> 26:11.154
Well, it just means
he's not going to remember
any of it, Ricky. Luckily.

26:11.237 --> 26:14.407
Yes, he is. One of my
fucking first memories
is when I was three.

26:14.491 --> 26:16.993
Rick, what do you
remember about
being three?

26:17.076 --> 26:19.496
The time my dad took me
down to the nice lake

26:19.578 --> 26:22.999
and we had
a good barbecue
and went fishing

26:23.082 --> 26:24.250
and he gave me
my first cigarette

26:24.334 --> 26:26.169
and taught me how to
inhale. I was three.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.045
No, you were six.

26:28.129 --> 26:30.173
You were almost
seven, Ricky.

26:30.256 --> 26:32.758
Don't you remember?
It was my birthday
that afternoon.

26:32.842 --> 26:36.595
That's how I remember.
You ate that big chunk of
hash out of Ray's tackle box.

26:36.679 --> 26:39.682
And you came to the party
running around saying, "I'm
a chicken! I'm a chicken!"

26:39.765 --> 26:41.518
And pooped yourself

26:41.600 --> 26:43.936
and threw up all over
the cake and hot dogs.
Holy fuck!

26:44.020 --> 26:46.063
You're fucking right!

26:46.147 --> 26:49.442
I was fucking six
or maybe seven!

26:49.526 --> 26:51.528
Holy fuck, boys.
This is a good thing.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.863
I mean, I don't think
I do remember anything
when I was three.

26:53.946 --> 26:57.033
Of course
you don't, man.
Nobody does, Ricky.

26:57.116 --> 26:59.618
Well, you know what?
Fuck it, then.

26:59.702 --> 27:03.789
If it's not going
affect Mo, I'm glad
he's not my fucking dad!

27:03.873 --> 27:06.959
I knew Ray was my old man!
I fucking knew it.
We're too much alike.

27:07.043 --> 27:09.962
Boys, this is actually
a really, really
fucking good thing.

27:10.046 --> 27:12.423
No, actually
it isn't.

27:12.507 --> 27:14.050
'Cause now that Lahey
know he's not your dad,

27:14.133 --> 27:16.927
he's gonna be coming
at us even harder now.

27:17.011 --> 27:20.348
Well, that depends
on... you know...

27:21.807 --> 27:24.394
(Brakes screech,
engine idles)

27:26.479 --> 27:30.441
This is our Ireland
wedding money, Mr. Lahey.
Are you sure about this?

27:30.525 --> 27:33.570
I've never been more
sure about anything
in my life, Ran.

27:33.652 --> 27:36.531
Get as much as you can
fit in the cart, bud.

27:36.614 --> 27:39.576
(Theme music)

28:21.242 --> 28:23.827
(Seabirds squawking)

28:36.257 --> 28:40.261
Fish:
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck off! Fuck!...

28:40.344 --> 28:43.222
Fuck off! Jesus Christ!

28:46.934 --> 28:48.060
(Whisper)
<i>Fuck.</i>

28:48.144 --> 28:50.563
(Light clicks off)
<i>Fuck off.</i>
