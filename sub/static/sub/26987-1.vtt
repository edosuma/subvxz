01:55.167 --> 01:56.292
Ma.

02:02.375 --> 02:03.667
That's it.

02:05.167 --> 02:06.208
Mama.

02:32.083 --> 02:33.167
Kay?

02:40.958 --> 02:42.000
Hey!

02:43.208 --> 02:44.208
Hello!

02:47.708 --> 02:48.708
Hey.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.208
So we have three meals.

03:54.292 --> 03:55.625
Four at a stretch.

03:55.708 --> 03:56.792
Okay.

03:58.917 --> 04:01.625
So that means
we're down to quarter rations.

04:03.042 --> 04:04.042
Okay.

04:04.625 --> 04:07.542
Is there a plan I'm not aware of?
Want to fill me in on it?

04:08.667 --> 04:10.333
- No, I like your plan.
- Which is?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.375
That we eat the pens.

04:13.500 --> 04:15.417
Look, there's a town here.

04:15.500 --> 04:17.916
Can't be more than
30 or 40 km from where we are.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.291
Right? It's rural.
There's not a lot of people.

04:20.375 --> 04:23.833
I say we get a car, fill it with supplies,
we just see what's out there.

04:24.500 --> 04:28.417
- We've seen what's out there.
- We've seen what's back there. Weeks ago.

04:28.833 --> 04:31.208
- It's quiet on the banks...
- We talked about this.

04:31.292 --> 04:33.500
- What if we've outrun it?
- What if we haven't?

04:34.000 --> 04:36.917
Where we need to be, actually, is here.

04:37.375 --> 04:39.042
The river has got us this far.

04:39.125 --> 04:42.958
If we play it smart, it'll get us there,
but we have to stick to what we know.

04:43.542 --> 04:47.958
What we know? You had barely set foot
on a boat before we found this thing.

04:48.042 --> 04:50.458
I mean,
it's older than both of us put together.

04:50.542 --> 04:52.792
What if the engine goes?
What happens then?

04:52.875 --> 04:54.375
We have to think about Rosie.

04:54.458 --> 04:58.042
Do we? I hadn't thought of that.
What the fuck do you think I'm doing?

05:00.500 --> 05:04.083
Look, we can't set foot on the shore
until it is our last and only option.

05:04.167 --> 05:06.083
That's just the way it is, I'm sorry.

05:06.958 --> 05:10.625
So is that going to be before or after
our daughter starves to death?

05:17.625 --> 05:18.875
Shh.

07:17.833 --> 07:19.125
Jesus Christ.

07:28.958 --> 07:29.958
My God.

07:41.042 --> 07:42.083
Wow.

08:49.208 --> 08:51.708
- Any bites?
- Um-mm. Not yet.

08:53.542 --> 08:56.667
- Oh, hang on a second.
- Quick. Hook him with the thing.

08:56.750 --> 08:59.500
- What, with the hook? Whoa.
- Yeah, bring him in, quick!

09:01.917 --> 09:03.500
- What?
- What's that?

09:03.583 --> 09:06.375
- Where did you get this from?
- From the wrecked yacht.

09:06.458 --> 09:08.708
Say thank you. Look at this.

09:09.417 --> 09:12.125
There's enough there
for three months, at least.

09:13.708 --> 09:16.042
- Hey, this is good news, Blue.
- It's great news.

09:16.667 --> 09:18.792
You're not worried. It was a one-man job.

09:18.875 --> 09:20.542
In and out. Easy. Safe.

09:21.500 --> 09:23.750
Come on, this is a win, Blue.
This is a win.

09:23.833 --> 09:25.042
We must celebrate those

09:25.125 --> 09:27.833
- when they come along, just a little bit.
- No, okay.

09:27.917 --> 09:29.833
- You sure it was safe?
- Safe.

09:40.667 --> 09:43.167
Is there a razor in that stash of yours?

09:43.250 --> 09:45.792
Why? I'll have you know, this is rugged.

09:45.875 --> 09:47.625
- I think it's a bit ragged.
- Rugged.

09:48.667 --> 09:49.708
Rugged.

09:54.042 --> 09:55.792
How is she? How is little monkey?

09:55.875 --> 09:57.208
She's been down a while.

09:57.875 --> 09:59.792
Maybe you should go say hello.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.125
I'm not sure she'd like that much.

10:05.292 --> 10:06.667
Hey, go and have a lie down.

10:07.167 --> 10:09.167
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Go.

10:13.375 --> 10:14.417
Man.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.375
- You are.
- Woman.

10:32.542 --> 10:34.542
Good girl, Rosie. Yes.

12:21.083 --> 12:23.083
Yes.

12:23.750 --> 12:24.917
Okay.

12:52.958 --> 12:54.208
Oh!

12:54.833 --> 12:56.250
Hey.

12:56.333 --> 12:58.792
- Mama.
- Hey, darling. Okay, all right.

12:59.750 --> 13:00.625
Ohh!

13:00.708 --> 13:01.917
Mommy.

13:03.833 --> 13:05.250
Where's Mommy then?

13:05.833 --> 13:06.958
Where is she?

13:14.375 --> 13:15.292
Kay?

13:20.125 --> 13:22.125
Kay?
Are you in there?

13:22.750 --> 13:25.083
Kay! Come on, let me in, babe.

13:26.042 --> 13:26.958
Let me in.

13:29.583 --> 13:31.333
Shit, Kay, what...

13:32.042 --> 13:33.042
What have you done?

13:33.125 --> 13:34.917
- No, don't...
- Let me see.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.625
- No.
- Well, keep pressure on it.

13:37.083 --> 13:38.917
- Mama.
- It's all right. It's okay.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.917
Oh, shit.

13:52.708 --> 13:54.542
Come on, let me see.

13:56.625 --> 13:58.375
Oh, fuck.

13:59.083 --> 14:00.667
Right, Kay, just...

14:02.375 --> 14:03.958
Oh, what have you done?

14:07.708 --> 14:10.500
- I'm sorry, sweetheart.
- It's all right. It's okay.

14:11.292 --> 14:14.750
All right, keep that pressure on it.
Keep pressure on.

14:14.833 --> 14:16.625
Shit.

14:16.708 --> 14:19.500
- Okay. All right? You okay?
- Yeah.

14:19.583 --> 14:20.708
All right? Look at me.

14:21.083 --> 14:23.250
- It's okay.
- It's going to be okay.

14:42.833 --> 14:43.958
Hey.

14:47.458 --> 14:50.708
- So talk to me. What are you thinking?
- Well, we can't stay here.

14:51.458 --> 14:54.917
But it's only been an hour.
Symptoms take at least three hours to...

14:55.000 --> 14:57.750
Yeah, I know how it works.
We might not have that time.

14:58.250 --> 15:00.917
- We can't take the risk.
- Oh, so today it's a risk.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.750
Out there, with this?
Yes, it's a risk.

15:04.333 --> 15:07.500
Let's not put Rosie in danger
till we know what we're dealing with.

15:07.583 --> 15:10.417
There are dozens of things
that live and eat in this river.

15:10.500 --> 15:13.167
- We have no idea what bit you.
- It had fingers, Andy.

15:13.583 --> 15:14.833
Fuck!

15:18.958 --> 15:23.250
Look, if you are sick,
then you've got 48 hours,

15:23.333 --> 15:24.750
and we'll deal with that.

15:24.833 --> 15:27.500
But if you're wrong, right,
and you're not infected,

15:27.583 --> 15:31.583
then at the rate you're bleeding,
you've got two hours, three, tops.

15:33.458 --> 15:35.167
That's a risk I'm not gonna take.

15:35.250 --> 15:37.500
We need to get to the hospital,
where you said.

15:37.583 --> 15:40.042
Someone will patch you up
and we'll hedge our bets.

15:40.125 --> 15:41.250
What if we lose?

15:42.125 --> 15:43.625
What if we lose?

15:48.958 --> 15:50.500
It's gonna be my call.

15:54.208 --> 15:55.292
Yeah.

16:21.833 --> 16:23.792
Come on.

16:26.792 --> 16:27.958
Don't look.

17:34.417 --> 17:36.000
Come on, little darling.

17:38.208 --> 17:39.333
Okay.

17:40.250 --> 17:42.083
Oh, good girl. Come here.

17:42.875 --> 17:45.083
Put you in here for a minute. There we go.

18:00.875 --> 18:02.625
Come on.

18:08.708 --> 18:10.708
Oh, you beauty.

18:14.708 --> 18:15.750
Right.

18:15.833 --> 18:18.083
Just like that.

18:19.167 --> 18:20.875
- Come here.
- Thanks, sweetheart.

18:20.958 --> 18:23.500
Come here.
I just need you in the car, all right?

18:26.292 --> 18:27.292
Impossible.

18:27.375 --> 18:29.500
I'll get in. Have a fiddle around with it.

18:29.583 --> 18:30.917
Okay, I'll be two secs.

18:32.625 --> 18:34.042
Right.

18:36.083 --> 18:37.625
There you are, poppet.

18:37.708 --> 18:40.958
There, the new mobile's sorted for you.

18:41.792 --> 18:43.500
Mama's here.

18:53.167 --> 18:54.500
Good girl.

19:33.417 --> 19:35.250
Go!

20:10.375 --> 20:11.500
How're you feeling?

20:12.500 --> 20:13.583
Like me.

20:15.083 --> 20:16.542
Good.

20:17.292 --> 20:20.958
Hey, monkey, what is it, darling?

20:21.625 --> 20:22.750
She needs a change.

20:22.833 --> 20:24.292
- I'll do it.
- No, it's fine.

20:24.375 --> 20:25.667
She'll make less fuss.

20:26.458 --> 20:28.875
- 'Course she will.
- Come on, stinky trunks.

20:32.417 --> 20:34.167
Let's get you cleaned up.

20:36.708 --> 20:37.958
There we go.

20:39.208 --> 20:41.167
Hey!

20:41.542 --> 20:42.542
Eww!

20:43.250 --> 20:45.125
Hey, Rosie posie.

20:53.417 --> 20:54.333
Kay!

20:59.875 --> 21:02.000
Hey, Rosie.

21:06.375 --> 21:08.458
Kay, give me your head.

21:09.292 --> 21:11.875
All right. Shh...

21:14.708 --> 21:16.667
Shh.

22:10.708 --> 22:13.000
- Kay? Just breathe.
- Stop the car.

22:13.083 --> 22:14.667
- Look at me now.
- Stop the car!

22:14.750 --> 22:17.167
- We need to keep calm...
- Let me out now!

22:17.250 --> 22:18.708
Jesus! Wait!

22:21.292 --> 22:22.417
Christ!

22:27.000 --> 22:28.167
Kay.

22:29.042 --> 22:30.083
Kay.

22:30.167 --> 22:31.625
Hey, listen. Will you just...

22:31.708 --> 22:33.208
Fuckin' don't touch me!

22:34.000 --> 22:36.167
Andy, you can't control this.

22:36.958 --> 22:39.208
You don't fucking keep this from me!

22:40.417 --> 22:44.042
How long were you going to play along for?
What, until I turn on you?

22:44.125 --> 22:45.625
- On her?
- No.

22:45.708 --> 22:47.333
- You must take her.
- What?

22:47.417 --> 22:50.667
- What are you talking about? Leaving you?
- You must take her.

22:50.750 --> 22:52.375
Stop. Just stop.

22:53.625 --> 22:54.750
Come on.

23:01.417 --> 23:02.708
I'm here, all right?

23:03.292 --> 23:04.625
It'll be all right.

23:25.625 --> 23:27.167
Come on, let's get you up.

23:28.750 --> 23:30.542
We're not going to the hospital.

23:30.625 --> 23:31.542
We are so close.

23:31.625 --> 23:34.500
It puts you and Rosie
further from the river.

23:36.750 --> 23:38.417
There's nothing there for us now.

23:38.500 --> 23:41.083
Yeah there is. Time is there. See this?

23:41.167 --> 23:44.458
That's yours. All of it, every second,
and we're gonna make it count.

23:45.250 --> 23:47.750
But if you bleed out, you'll turn sooner.

23:48.708 --> 23:50.458
It's my call, remember?

23:50.792 --> 23:53.167
So I get no say in that?
I don't have a choice?

23:53.250 --> 23:54.833
No, sweetheart, you don't.

24:09.333 --> 24:10.458
Kay.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.250
I can't do that.

24:13.042 --> 24:14.667
Watch the leg.

24:48.167 --> 24:49.458
Shit!

25:09.792 --> 25:10.917
Kay?

25:14.708 --> 25:15.958
Rosie?

25:22.708 --> 25:24.750
Hey, how're we doing?

25:24.833 --> 25:26.458
Rosie? Rose.

25:44.875 --> 25:46.083
Kay.

26:23.250 --> 26:24.417
Hey.

26:35.667 --> 26:37.583
Blue?

26:48.917 --> 26:49.833
Rosie!

26:49.917 --> 26:50.875
Fuck!

26:51.625 --> 26:52.875
Oh, fuck!

26:54.792 --> 26:55.875
They're coming.

26:59.083 --> 27:01.417
I need you to be a very good girl.
Stay here.

27:01.917 --> 27:03.667
Nice and calm for Daddy.

27:04.792 --> 27:07.542
And he'll be right back.
Hey, Rosie? Be right back.

27:42.292 --> 27:43.333
Oh.

28:15.083 --> 28:18.542
No. No.

29:17.750 --> 29:19.792
Mmm? It's all right.

29:20.792 --> 29:22.167
I know what you like.

29:25.833 --> 29:27.042
Umm.

29:35.417 --> 29:36.583
Hey, Rosie.

29:40.542 --> 29:41.708
It's Mommy.

29:44.583 --> 29:46.000
I can smell Mommy.

29:47.625 --> 29:49.708
I can smell Mommy too.

29:53.667 --> 29:54.667
Hey.

30:06.333 --> 30:07.417
Hey!

30:07.833 --> 30:09.333
Do you know what you just did?

30:13.833 --> 30:16.000
You stay away. Stay back.

30:18.125 --> 30:19.542
Leave my dad alone!

32:37.958 --> 32:40.167
What's the count left on that business?

32:40.875 --> 32:42.000
Uh...

32:43.792 --> 32:47.000
It's 46 hours, give or take.

32:48.792 --> 32:49.792
Sit.

33:05.958 --> 33:07.292
Give us your arm.

33:16.917 --> 33:18.667
Won't do much, I'm afraid.

33:22.167 --> 33:23.708
But it might help you hide it.

33:24.583 --> 33:26.625
Best to do that around these parts.

33:30.833 --> 33:33.000
It's all right, darling.

33:33.958 --> 33:35.292
Who's this then?

33:36.167 --> 33:37.458
It's Rosie.

33:37.958 --> 33:40.375
- Mama.
- Little flower.

33:46.500 --> 33:48.125
Folks call me Etta.

33:48.208 --> 33:49.292
Andy.

33:51.250 --> 33:54.583
This place looked bigger on the map.

33:54.667 --> 33:57.625
- We never fail to disappoint.
- The hospital, is it...

33:57.708 --> 34:00.667
That's a generous description.
It's the next building over.

34:00.750 --> 34:03.458
There's not much left.
They cut our funding years back.

34:03.542 --> 34:04.667
Are you a teacher?

34:05.833 --> 34:06.958
I was.

34:08.083 --> 34:09.917
Where are they now, your students?

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
Gone.

34:12.167 --> 34:13.125
I'm sorry.

34:13.208 --> 34:17.083
No, not dead. Gone.
Living in the old ways.

34:17.875 --> 34:21.125
Nothing to be sorry about.
They're doing better than the rest of us.

34:21.542 --> 34:24.125
Mobs from all over the country
coming together.

34:24.583 --> 34:27.250
They sensed it,
those who stayed connected.

34:29.583 --> 34:33.208
The whole community
up and left back to their country.

34:36.917 --> 34:38.792
There's a spare bed if you want one.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.292
What do you think, Rosie?
Do we like her?

34:51.958 --> 34:53.458
Do we like her?

34:56.458 --> 34:57.792
I think we might like her.

35:26.875 --> 35:28.375
Okay.

35:54.375 --> 35:55.708
Thoomi!

36:00.500 --> 36:01.958
Thoomi!

36:05.875 --> 36:07.375
Thoomi!

36:11.458 --> 36:12.750
<i>Come home!</i>

36:18.417 --> 36:19.583
Shh.

36:26.208 --> 36:27.417
Shh.

36:30.583 --> 36:33.583
- <i>what are we gonna do with this?
- Make spears?</i>

36:37.750 --> 36:39.500
Bit like Mom's spaghetti, eh?

36:39.583 --> 36:40.583
Dad!

36:41.583 --> 36:44.792
Back in the old days,
we used to take this from an animal.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.625
Mr. Clever Man!

36:54.542 --> 36:56.708
They're poisoning this land,
you know?

37:01.167 --> 37:03.000
This country, changing.

37:03.750 --> 37:04.833
It's sick.

37:06.042 --> 37:07.375
We all get sick.

37:08.083 --> 37:09.708
You get sick too.

39:01.208 --> 39:02.417
Yeah.

39:04.333 --> 39:05.542
Hey, Etta.

39:07.875 --> 39:09.875
You can't do that. You can't lose hope.

39:17.333 --> 39:18.625
This is Willie Bell.

39:19.333 --> 39:23.500
He's a good man. A friend.
His daughter Thoomi was one of mine.

39:24.833 --> 39:26.167
Smart as a whip.

39:26.625 --> 39:29.583
- Her daddy's shadow.
- Yeah, I've seen them.

39:30.042 --> 39:33.583
Well, you just head right back
and tell Willie that Etta sent you.

39:33.667 --> 39:36.292
If you want to give this baby
a second chance,

39:36.375 --> 39:37.792
that's where you go.

39:37.875 --> 39:39.083
Yeah?

39:39.833 --> 39:41.000
Thanks.

39:42.208 --> 39:44.292
- Have you seen the fires?
- Yeah.

39:44.375 --> 39:48.375
Hunting parties are cleansing the land
of the sick ones. You just stay away.

39:50.708 --> 39:52.667
Hey, Rosie.

39:52.750 --> 39:54.667
Bye bye, darling. Bye bye.

39:56.417 --> 39:57.583
Bye bye.

39:58.917 --> 40:00.333
Now you take care.

41:06.583 --> 41:08.333
Hello, what's here?

41:12.667 --> 41:14.583
Let's give you some water, darling.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.458
That's mine.

42:08.917 --> 42:10.042
Fuck.

42:11.375 --> 42:13.042
Army base is overrun.

42:14.417 --> 42:15.625
There'll be more.

42:15.708 --> 42:18.083
They would have heard that shot for miles.

42:18.708 --> 42:20.417
Better keep that baby quiet too.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.875
Listen, how about you get me out of here
and then I'll get you out of here?

42:26.958 --> 42:28.000
To where?

42:28.542 --> 42:30.292
A place you could hole up for a bit.

42:31.792 --> 42:35.500
The little one, be real nice
for the wife to have that around.

42:41.042 --> 42:43.958
You better think fast. Tow it off me.

42:44.042 --> 42:45.042
Shit.

42:45.125 --> 42:46.750
- Come on.
- Got the keys?

43:00.167 --> 43:01.458
Don't you fuck me.

43:23.083 --> 43:24.500
Good man. Take this.

44:06.458 --> 44:07.667
Come on. Let's go.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.417
Flagged me down on the highway,
this bloke.

44:19.500 --> 44:21.708
Put himself in a spot with some diggers.

44:23.125 --> 44:24.208
Hello.

44:25.500 --> 44:26.625
Hello.

44:27.125 --> 44:29.042
Attagirl. Close your eyes.

44:40.208 --> 44:41.333
It's nice.

44:43.917 --> 44:45.042
No, it's beautiful.

44:45.750 --> 44:47.333
Rainey'll get you settled.

44:57.542 --> 44:59.250
Do you mind if I put her down?

45:23.000 --> 45:25.167
He doesn't bring people back.

45:25.250 --> 45:27.917
Well, we're very glad
he made an exception, aren't we?

45:31.000 --> 45:32.125
Thanks.

45:37.292 --> 45:39.583
- That's why we're here.
- What, the gas?

45:40.417 --> 45:43.417
Vic has plans
for when things get back to normal.

45:44.042 --> 45:46.667
It's not going to happen. Is it?

45:47.542 --> 45:49.500
I don't think normal is on the horizon.

45:55.083 --> 45:56.708
You worked on the lines?

45:57.208 --> 45:58.500
In the canteen.

45:59.625 --> 46:00.792
I cooked.

46:01.333 --> 46:03.875
Right, well,
that's the most important job of all.

46:04.458 --> 46:05.875
Men must have loved you.

46:06.750 --> 46:07.958
One did.

46:16.750 --> 46:18.875
You're the first people I've seen.

46:20.917 --> 46:23.250
The first people who are still people.

46:25.125 --> 46:26.708
Yeah.

46:32.875 --> 46:34.458
All right, mate, let's go.

46:34.958 --> 46:36.958
They've only just arrived, Vic.

46:38.042 --> 46:40.000
Well, if he's in, he's all the way in.

46:41.583 --> 46:44.458
Rainey'll look after her.
Take her up there, cuddle her.

46:44.542 --> 46:46.083
Won't even notice you're gone.

46:48.958 --> 46:50.250
I'll keep her safe.

46:53.917 --> 46:54.917
Great.

46:57.292 --> 46:58.708
Please look after her.

46:59.292 --> 47:00.333
Okay.

47:02.375 --> 47:04.125
Come on, Rosie. This is...

47:05.583 --> 47:06.667
- You okay?
- Mama!

47:06.750 --> 47:07.917
Yes.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
Hey.

47:09.083 --> 47:10.292
This calms her down.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.042
Okay.

47:15.042 --> 47:16.667
- All right...
- See you soon.

47:16.750 --> 47:17.750
Yeah.

47:18.750 --> 47:19.833
Yeah.

47:37.750 --> 47:38.750
Vic.

47:40.750 --> 47:41.875
What's this?

47:44.750 --> 47:46.000
Ever used one of these?

47:46.708 --> 47:47.750
No.

47:52.708 --> 47:53.958
Move forward.

47:54.042 --> 47:55.292
Stand forty-five.

47:55.792 --> 47:57.750
Forty-five degrees to the target.

47:57.833 --> 47:59.875
Now move the stock into your shoulder...

47:59.958 --> 48:01.417
We're going to shoot them?

48:02.292 --> 48:03.333
Yeah.

48:04.208 --> 48:07.667
You're not gonna kiss 'em, are ya?
Now cheek to the cheek plate.

48:07.750 --> 48:10.042
If the target's blurry,
you're doing it right.

48:10.625 --> 48:11.917
- Yeah?
- You got it?

48:12.250 --> 48:15.708
- Uh, I'm not sure. I think so.
- Squeeze the trigger but don't pull it.

48:16.167 --> 48:17.083
- Really?
- Yeah.

48:17.167 --> 48:20.792
If you pull it, then you throw
your sights out. So back up.

48:21.333 --> 48:22.542
Now squeeze.

48:22.625 --> 48:26.083
Feel the resistance. Squeeze...

48:28.167 --> 48:29.167
All right.

48:31.083 --> 48:35.167
Now keep shooting till you drop him...
and don't stop till we got 'em all.

48:41.917 --> 48:43.708
Come on, I can't carry you, mate.

49:21.708 --> 49:23.250
I thought we were here for gas.

49:23.333 --> 49:26.375
- Call it a side earner.
- What's that got to do with her?

49:27.042 --> 49:28.917
Can't catch a fish without bait.

49:29.375 --> 49:32.792
When this country gets back on track,
people are gonna want things.

49:33.875 --> 49:36.542
Whoever controls the market, power, gas...

49:37.500 --> 49:40.333
all the shiny shit...
will be sitting pretty.

49:42.167 --> 49:44.292
I'm just making hay while the sun shines.

49:44.375 --> 49:46.042
The sun's not shining, Vic.

49:47.500 --> 49:48.667
What's it worth to ya?

49:50.167 --> 49:52.042
A safe place for you and your kid?

50:02.875 --> 50:05.792
Only girl you need to be worried about
is your own.

50:06.875 --> 50:07.917
Fill it up.

50:25.833 --> 50:28.875
Hey, it's okay.

50:28.958 --> 50:32.083
No, just low on gas, that's all.

50:32.167 --> 50:33.542
Just low on gas.

50:33.625 --> 50:35.208
Shh.

50:36.083 --> 50:37.625
Hey, Rosie.

51:10.292 --> 51:11.583
I told you mob.

51:11.667 --> 51:14.667
The wells are mine
along with what's in 'em.

51:21.125 --> 51:22.417
Fuck with me...

51:30.583 --> 51:31.917
...and I'll fuck with you.

51:39.333 --> 51:40.750
You look lonely in there.

51:41.583 --> 51:44.417
See if we can drum you up some company.

52:22.792 --> 52:23.958
She's sleeping.

52:46.250 --> 52:47.417
You did well today.

52:48.417 --> 52:51.167
Maybe we can talk about
you staying on permanent.

52:54.458 --> 52:55.625
I cleaned her up.

53:30.625 --> 53:31.542
Oop.

53:43.458 --> 53:45.625
Come on. You're all right. Come on.

53:51.333 --> 53:52.417
Oh.

54:13.667 --> 54:14.875
Hey, Rosie.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.042
I love you.

55:27.333 --> 55:29.500
Come on, you fucker.

55:29.583 --> 55:32.375
Come on, you fucker.

55:34.625 --> 55:35.875
Please don't.

55:39.917 --> 55:40.958
Lorraine.

55:41.542 --> 55:42.708
You shouldn't be here.

55:43.583 --> 55:45.958
I know what you're doing, and I know why.

55:46.542 --> 55:48.667
Please, just look after her for me.

55:48.750 --> 55:49.792
I will.

55:50.250 --> 55:51.417
But not here.

55:51.500 --> 55:54.333
- Lorraine, this is as safe as it gets.
- Not from him.

55:56.167 --> 55:58.417
- What's your count?
- It's around 20.

55:58.500 --> 56:02.000
- Take us somewhere else.
- He is not perfect, but here it's secure.

56:02.083 --> 56:04.042
- Your husband...
- He's not my husband.

56:05.000 --> 56:08.375
That man left my husband to die
at the gas plant with everyone else.

56:08.458 --> 56:10.250
Locked them in to save his own skin.

56:11.208 --> 56:14.417
I could protect this little girl
more than he ever will.

56:15.000 --> 56:16.167
But not here.

56:28.958 --> 56:32.250
There is a family by the river.
I don't know if they're still alive.

56:32.333 --> 56:35.875
- I don't know if we can make it in time.
- This looks cozy.

56:39.708 --> 56:43.333
If I didn't know better, I'd think
you were trying to steal my girl, Andy.

56:43.417 --> 56:44.667
You do know better.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.125
Rosie!

57:41.083 --> 57:43.625
Vic!

57:48.458 --> 57:52.292
Come on, let me out, you fuck!
I'm not going to hurt you.

57:52.375 --> 57:54.083
I'm not going to hurt you, okay?

57:56.875 --> 57:59.500
Okay, come with me.
I need to have a look at this.

58:00.417 --> 58:03.042
God, look, I'm not going to hurt you,
I promise you.

58:03.125 --> 58:06.500
When I saw you...
when I saw you yesterday...

58:06.583 --> 58:09.208
I'm sorry about that.
You can be mad at me.

58:09.292 --> 58:11.708
If you want out, I'm your ticket.
Let's play ball.

58:13.250 --> 58:14.833
Do you want to see your friend?

58:14.917 --> 58:17.417
He's not my friend.
I just want my daughter back.

58:19.542 --> 58:21.667
- I want something too.
- What do you want?

58:22.375 --> 58:24.833
His keys to the Clever Man's cage.

58:24.917 --> 58:26.750
Whatever that is, you can have 'em.

58:38.958 --> 58:40.542
- They're coming.
- Huh?

58:40.625 --> 58:42.667
The ghosts. They smell it.

59:29.833 --> 59:31.250
Come on.

59:46.750 --> 59:48.083
Shit.

59:48.167 --> 59:51.167
When this lifts up,
you gotta slide out straight away.

59:52.167 --> 59:53.958
Come on. That's it.

59:59.625 --> 01:00:01.042
Come on! That's it! Let's go!

01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:32.458
Go!

01:01:36.875 --> 01:01:39.542
Here, Lorraine, give her to me.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.375
Fucking thief!

01:01:43.042 --> 01:01:44.458
Get back here!

01:01:44.542 --> 01:01:46.083
- Andy!
- No!

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:50.458
Vic, no!

01:02:17.667 --> 01:02:18.833
Rainey!

01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:21.958
Rainey!

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.375
He's gone.

01:02:45.458 --> 01:02:46.833
Come on, let's go.

01:03:09.167 --> 01:03:10.417
Wait.

01:03:16.917 --> 01:03:20.083
I can smell your rot, you weasly cunt!

01:03:21.083 --> 01:03:23.500
- What you took didn't belong to you!
- Shit.

01:03:34.083 --> 01:03:37.958
You give me back the fucking black bitch!

01:03:38.917 --> 01:03:39.917
She's mine!

01:03:40.792 --> 01:03:45.167
If you give her to me, then maybe
there'll be a happy ending for your kid!

01:03:46.292 --> 01:03:48.542
But if I have to fucking come looking,

01:03:49.292 --> 01:03:52.167
then it'll be bad for you
and worse for them.

01:03:53.292 --> 01:03:55.625
Shh.

01:03:59.792 --> 01:04:03.208
Maybe I'll just wait
a couple of days, huh?

01:04:05.083 --> 01:04:07.000
Until you're not you anymore.

01:04:08.917 --> 01:04:10.333
And I'll just watch...

01:04:11.208 --> 01:04:14.167
while you eat their fucking faces off.

01:05:16.125 --> 01:05:17.208
Good girl.

01:06:06.375 --> 01:06:09.667
Thoomi, I need to get back to the river.
Can you show me the way?

01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:11.333
I've gotta find the Clever Man.

01:06:11.417 --> 01:06:15.292
Oh, look, I don't have time for...
What is a Clever Man, anyway?

01:06:15.375 --> 01:06:17.458
Is he just a smart guy, or what?

01:06:18.583 --> 01:06:19.958
He's a magic man.

01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:24.500
If you're sick,
he can give you good medicine.

01:06:24.583 --> 01:06:28.875
And if someone steals your spirit away,
he can put it back again.

01:06:29.458 --> 01:06:33.792
Hey, you think your dad is acting
the way he is because he lost his soul?

01:06:35.625 --> 01:06:38.250
There are lots of people
walking around like your dad.

01:06:38.333 --> 01:06:40.833
- My dad's different.
- I don't think that's true.

01:06:41.625 --> 01:06:43.833
There's no fixing
what your father and I have.

01:06:43.917 --> 01:06:45.792
Lots of other smart guys have tried.

01:06:51.542 --> 01:06:52.667
Where are you going?

01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:54.458
I've gotta check something.

01:06:55.042 --> 01:06:56.333
Check what?

01:06:56.417 --> 01:06:58.042
Thoomi, check what?

01:06:58.625 --> 01:06:59.917
For fuck's sake.

01:08:35.292 --> 01:08:37.457
Jesus, Thoomi.

01:08:37.542 --> 01:08:38.542
Hey, stop!

01:08:38.625 --> 01:08:39.832
Go away!

01:08:40.457 --> 01:08:43.125
This is sorry business.
You're just a stupid <i> gubba.</i>

01:08:43.207 --> 01:08:44.542
You don't know anything.

01:08:52.832 --> 01:08:54.000
That's my dad.

01:08:55.707 --> 01:08:59.750
We get buried in the trees
so the ghosts can't wake us.

01:09:01.957 --> 01:09:03.832
His spirit's still loose.

01:09:03.917 --> 01:09:04.957
It's my fault.

01:09:05.582 --> 01:09:06.832
I took too long.

01:09:08.957 --> 01:09:10.042
No you didn't.

01:09:10.625 --> 01:09:12.875
No you didn't. This isn't your fault.

01:09:12.957 --> 01:09:15.832
I tied him here till I could bring
the Clever Man back.

01:09:15.917 --> 01:09:17.707
They weren't supposed to find him.

01:09:18.167 --> 01:09:20.375
They thought
they were doing the right thing.

01:09:21.792 --> 01:09:22.875
They did.

01:09:24.542 --> 01:09:26.375
That wasn't your dad anymore.

01:09:28.082 --> 01:09:29.582
I'm sorry, but it wasn't.

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:34.375
I should have been here,
with him, not you.

01:09:40.875 --> 01:09:42.792
Thoomi, I have to go. I'm sorry.

01:09:47.207 --> 01:09:49.542
I think Rosie would like it
if you came with us.

01:09:49.625 --> 01:09:51.375
I'd be happier if you did.

01:09:52.625 --> 01:09:55.667
I don't care about you or your baby.

01:09:59.458 --> 01:10:00.917
I don't think you mean that.

01:10:14.833 --> 01:10:16.167
She'll be okay.

01:10:17.542 --> 01:10:19.167
She'll be okay. Shit.

01:10:19.958 --> 01:10:21.125
Shit.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.083
Rosie?

01:11:35.083 --> 01:11:36.292
River's this way.

01:13:05.375 --> 01:13:06.625
What's with the leaves?

01:13:08.042 --> 01:13:09.750
They hide my footprints.

01:13:11.625 --> 01:13:13.250
From who? The ghosts?

01:13:13.333 --> 01:13:14.875
No, my mom.

01:13:24.333 --> 01:13:25.500
Hello?

01:13:29.625 --> 01:13:30.667
Hungry?

01:13:50.083 --> 01:13:51.083
Yes.

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:53.750
Bingo.

01:13:55.792 --> 01:13:58.042
This might sting a little bit.

01:13:58.667 --> 01:13:59.625
Where is it?

01:14:00.250 --> 01:14:01.458
There? Ready?

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:08.625
Why'd you do that?

01:14:09.583 --> 01:14:10.792
It's from the old ways.

01:14:12.042 --> 01:14:13.375
But not our ways anymore.

01:14:13.458 --> 01:14:14.958
Then why?

01:14:16.542 --> 01:14:17.667
'Cause it hurts.

01:14:18.042 --> 01:14:21.333
When this hurt heals,
maybe this hurt heals too.

01:14:25.292 --> 01:14:26.792
Where did all the people go?

01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:29.958
Not far.

01:14:30.417 --> 01:14:31.750
The food's still fresh.

01:14:32.458 --> 01:14:33.958
Why do you want 'em?

01:14:34.333 --> 01:14:36.250
'Cause I want to ask them a favor.

01:14:36.333 --> 01:14:38.667
About bub? Are they gonna keep her?

01:14:39.042 --> 01:14:41.500
We should think about
what we're gonna do with you.

01:14:41.583 --> 01:14:43.125
Maybe they won't come back.

01:14:44.083 --> 01:14:45.417
I think they will.

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:46.708
What if they don't?

01:14:49.792 --> 01:14:51.083
Then you're all I've got.

01:15:42.875 --> 01:15:43.917
Hello?

01:15:52.042 --> 01:15:53.250
The caravan's yours.

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:56.333
Car too, if you can start it.

01:15:57.167 --> 01:15:58.542
It's not the car I need.

01:16:17.083 --> 01:16:18.042
Look.

01:16:19.583 --> 01:16:21.542
I've got six, okay?

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:25.125
The last two are yours,
if you go that way.

01:16:25.208 --> 01:16:28.375
- Please, don't do that.
- I can't leave them.

01:16:28.875 --> 01:16:31.083
I said I wouldn't and I won't, so...

01:16:34.792 --> 01:16:35.792
Hey.

01:16:36.917 --> 01:16:40.042
Look, Daddy, that man has a baby!

01:16:40.833 --> 01:16:42.125
Yes, he does.

01:16:45.292 --> 01:16:46.958
Should we say goodbye to the baby?

01:16:47.042 --> 01:16:48.333
Yeah.

01:16:48.417 --> 01:16:49.958
They're leaving now.

01:16:50.042 --> 01:16:52.125
Bye bye, baby!

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.125
Hey, mate.

01:17:00.167 --> 01:17:01.250
Just take the two.

01:17:01.792 --> 01:17:02.917
For her sake.

01:17:14.333 --> 01:17:16.792
Where's my pirate, ey?

01:17:17.375 --> 01:17:19.625
We gonna come
and find this treasure?

01:17:19.708 --> 01:17:20.833
Hey? Come on.

01:18:52.375 --> 01:18:53.500
Dad.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.250
Daddy.

01:19:04.208 --> 01:19:05.875
Come here, Rosie.

01:19:10.208 --> 01:19:12.250
Hey, Thoomi.

01:19:12.333 --> 01:19:13.333
Hey.

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:16.292
Hey.

01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:22.500
What's happened to your leaves?

01:19:23.583 --> 01:19:24.958
I wanna go home now.

01:19:25.875 --> 01:19:26.917
Really?

01:19:29.083 --> 01:19:30.375
You want my people?

01:19:32.583 --> 01:19:33.542
Yeah.

01:19:34.667 --> 01:19:35.750
Yeah, I do.

01:19:41.417 --> 01:19:44.000
Thoomi, if I don't make
it to the hills, you...

01:19:45.208 --> 01:19:46.917
- You don't have to. See?
- Hmm?

01:19:48.042 --> 01:19:49.208
They're close.

01:19:50.167 --> 01:19:51.250
<i>Atla.</i>

01:19:53.458 --> 01:19:54.917
Fire.

01:19:57.083 --> 01:19:58.083
<i>Atla.</i>

01:19:58.958 --> 01:19:59.958
Say <i> atla.</i>

01:20:01.833 --> 01:20:02.833
Okay.

01:20:07.167 --> 01:20:09.917
- What's that?
- Makes it so the ghosts can't track us.

01:20:10.583 --> 01:20:11.750
Really?

01:20:12.125 --> 01:20:14.708
- I'd better put some on.
- You don't need any.

01:20:14.792 --> 01:20:16.542
You smell like them already.

01:20:55.625 --> 01:20:57.375
Proper creepy in there.

01:20:57.917 --> 01:20:59.667
Proper creepy out there too.

01:21:28.417 --> 01:21:31.583
They're hibernating.
They need the dark.

01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:47.500
Vic!

01:23:31.208 --> 01:23:32.708
You fuck!

01:23:50.167 --> 01:23:51.958
Get the fuck outta there.

01:23:53.167 --> 01:23:54.417
Get out!

01:24:02.250 --> 01:24:03.542
Don't! Stop!

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:12.958
Shh.

01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:15.917
Shh.

01:24:28.792 --> 01:24:31.250
Thoomi! You all right?

01:24:31.333 --> 01:24:33.333
Oh, God. Where's Rosie?

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:35.667
Where's Rosie?

01:24:42.917 --> 01:24:45.083
It's all right.

01:24:46.833 --> 01:24:47.958
Rosie.

01:24:55.417 --> 01:24:57.333
Shh.

01:24:59.417 --> 01:25:00.708
Give her to me, Vic.

01:25:02.292 --> 01:25:03.417
Come on, mate.

01:25:04.917 --> 01:25:06.208
We're both fucked.

01:25:09.458 --> 01:25:10.792
Vic, I swear to Christ.

01:25:12.458 --> 01:25:13.958
If you hurt her...

01:25:18.250 --> 01:25:21.167
You took mine, now, I take yours.

01:25:21.875 --> 01:25:23.958
Lorraine wasn't yours though, Vic.

01:25:36.292 --> 01:25:37.417
Vic, don't...

01:25:38.292 --> 01:25:39.625
Don't you dare.

01:25:39.708 --> 01:25:41.875
Listen to me, Vic.

01:25:43.083 --> 01:25:44.292
It's done.

01:25:50.458 --> 01:25:52.375
All right. All right, darling.

01:25:52.458 --> 01:25:53.458
All right, darling.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.208
Thoomi?

01:26:15.333 --> 01:26:17.125
I know you're hurt, darling.

01:26:17.208 --> 01:26:18.542
Stay with me.

01:26:20.458 --> 01:26:21.833
Thoomi.

01:26:21.917 --> 01:26:23.042
Thoomi, please.

01:26:23.125 --> 01:26:25.708
We can't go any further
if you don't walk, okay?

01:26:25.792 --> 01:26:26.958
Do you understand me?

01:26:27.417 --> 01:26:29.458
Thoomi, wake up. Wake up, darling.

01:26:30.667 --> 01:26:31.917
Are you gonna help me?

01:26:32.917 --> 01:26:34.542
Let's help each other, yeah?

01:26:34.625 --> 01:26:36.042
- Yeah.
- Good girl.

01:26:38.875 --> 01:26:43.042
Teach me some of those words, mate.
Teach me how to say, "sun".

01:26:43.833 --> 01:26:44.708
Hmm?

01:26:44.792 --> 01:26:46.458
Teach me how to say "sky", then.

01:26:47.625 --> 01:26:48.958
Christ, teach me something.

01:26:49.042 --> 01:26:51.458
Teach me how to say "daddy".
How do you say that?

01:26:53.083 --> 01:26:55.125
<i>- Vapi.
- Vapi.</i> Great.

01:26:55.208 --> 01:26:56.583
How do you say "daughter"?

01:26:57.125 --> 01:26:58.792
<i>- Vapalu.</i>
- Yeah!

01:26:58.875 --> 01:27:02.083
How do you say...
What's that word you called me?

01:27:02.167 --> 01:27:04.333
<i>Gubba.</i> What was that? What does that mean?

01:27:04.417 --> 01:27:05.833
- White fella.
- White fella.

01:27:07.625 --> 01:27:08.750
White fella.

01:27:10.792 --> 01:27:12.333
Well, how do you say "friend"?

01:27:13.292 --> 01:27:14.667
<i>- Mita.
- Mita.</i>

01:27:15.458 --> 01:27:16.792
Yeah,<i> mita.</i>

01:27:16.875 --> 01:27:18.250
I prefer that one.

01:27:41.208 --> 01:27:43.250
Stop.

01:27:47.042 --> 01:27:48.042
Come here.

01:27:49.208 --> 01:27:50.333
Okay.

01:27:51.083 --> 01:27:52.208
Let go.

01:27:52.292 --> 01:27:54.625
Come. Help me.

01:27:55.125 --> 01:27:56.125
Help me.

01:27:57.458 --> 01:27:58.625
Hold onto her.

01:27:59.208 --> 01:28:00.417
Hold onto her.

01:29:07.792 --> 01:29:11.042
- Oh, shit.
- Stay close or they'll smell us.

01:29:11.958 --> 01:29:13.083
See?

01:29:13.167 --> 01:29:14.375
My paint's coming off.

01:29:47.083 --> 01:29:48.167
Take it.

01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:51.125
Take it away.

01:29:51.208 --> 01:29:52.417
Take it away.

01:30:04.792 --> 01:30:05.833
Okay.

01:30:06.917 --> 01:30:08.750
Now don't worry about this.

01:30:09.917 --> 01:30:14.167
You just treat this
like it's mom's spaghetti, okay?

01:30:15.125 --> 01:30:16.708
All right.

01:30:16.792 --> 01:30:20.125
Look after her for me, okay?
'Cause I'm going now.

01:30:20.208 --> 01:30:22.500
Look after her.
Will you do that for me,<i> mita?</i>

01:30:24.875 --> 01:30:26.167
- I will.
- All right, mate.

01:30:26.250 --> 01:30:28.042
- I promise.
- Thank you.

01:30:31.583 --> 01:30:32.625
Hey.

01:30:32.708 --> 01:30:34.458
Hey, Rosie, you're in good hands.

01:30:34.542 --> 01:30:37.208
You're in good hands.
She's gonna look after you, mate.

01:30:37.833 --> 01:30:39.083
I love you.

01:30:41.833 --> 01:30:42.958
Love you.

01:31:04.917 --> 01:31:07.625
Thoomi. Thoomi, now.

01:31:07.708 --> 01:31:09.125
Now.
