00:40.239 --> 00:43.208
Kevin. Did we reinforce
the take-off ramp?

00:43.476 --> 00:45.171
Nah, we didn't have time.

00:47.046 --> 00:48.343
Cool.

00:56.923 --> 00:59.050
Soul of an eagle.

01:15.575 --> 01:16.735
Oh, shit.

01:19.312 --> 01:20.779
Are you okay?

02:17.270 --> 02:18.669
What's up, little riders?

02:18.771 --> 02:22.867
I'm jumping the public pool tomorrow.
2 bucks. Tell your friends.

02:28.981 --> 02:30.881
Eat some smoke!

02:31.484 --> 02:33.247
That's just a sample.

02:33.953 --> 02:35.352
See you there.

02:48.601 --> 02:49.693
Pink grapefruit.

02:49.802 --> 02:50.928
Yes.

02:54.941 --> 02:56.909
- Toasted marshmallow.
- Yes.

02:57.109 --> 02:58.508
Finish her off.

03:02.215 --> 03:03.546
Raspberry?

03:04.217 --> 03:05.775
Psych! Very Cherry.

03:05.885 --> 03:07.011
A hundred straight.

03:09.055 --> 03:11.023
I'm gonna go drop some dumpage.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.189
- Voltron?
- That's me.

03:15.261 --> 03:17.229
- Hi, Dave.
- How you doing, Cathy?

03:17.430 --> 03:18.863
Why'd you call yourself Voltron?

03:18.965 --> 03:22.093
I don't know.
Maybe 'cause it's super badass.

03:23.603 --> 03:26.003
- You're weird.
- Hells, yeah, I am.

03:26.105 --> 03:27.163
Yoo-hoo, shitheads.

03:27.273 --> 03:29.366
I just found a bag of fireworks
in the men's restroom.

03:29.475 --> 03:30.874
Would you guys like to light them off?

03:30.977 --> 03:33.275
All right, boys. Prepare to be dazzled.

03:47.226 --> 03:48.420
Jumping the pool tomorrow!

04:06.646 --> 04:08.011
God damn. Rod!

04:09.615 --> 04:11.742
Mom? Have you seen my hip pads?

04:11.851 --> 04:13.113
In the kitchen.

04:13.219 --> 04:14.811
Rod, maybe you shouldn't fight Frank
this week.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.821
You know, you could rest up
for the jump tomorrow.

04:16.923 --> 04:20.916
Relax, Kev. I'm gonna win this time.
I did, like, 40 crunches yesterday.

04:21.027 --> 04:22.961
What is it with you two, anyway?

04:23.062 --> 04:24.529
You wouldn't understand, Kevin.

04:24.630 --> 04:26.689
He's your real dad
so he automatically loves you.

04:26.799 --> 04:29.495
But he's my stepdad. I have to earn it.

04:32.605 --> 04:35.574
Ancestors, protect me

04:36.075 --> 04:38.669
May they protect you

04:44.417 --> 04:45.816
Frank?

04:51.290 --> 04:52.484
Frank.

04:56.429 --> 04:57.589
Frank!

04:59.031 --> 05:01.829
Never sneak up on a man
who's been in a chemical fire.

05:01.934 --> 05:03.731
- Sorry.
- On your feet.

05:07.039 --> 05:08.165
What's this?

05:08.274 --> 05:11.937
Rhodesian fighting sticks.
Very, very lethal.

05:12.044 --> 05:13.671
Rhodesian. Of course.

05:16.916 --> 05:18.178
Come on.

05:20.619 --> 05:23.087
You are pathetic!

05:23.189 --> 05:24.656
Stop, stop, I give up! I give up!

05:24.757 --> 05:26.019
Yeah.

05:29.729 --> 05:31.162
No, Frank!

05:34.600 --> 05:37.398
Play the victim,
and you will be the victim.

05:38.437 --> 05:39.768
Very good, Frank.

05:40.606 --> 05:43.097
Very impressive. Ultimate punch!

05:47.947 --> 05:50.074
I'm gonna knock
that ridiculous mustache

05:50.182 --> 05:51.740
right off your face.

05:52.418 --> 05:54.579
All great men have mustaches, Frank.

05:55.788 --> 05:57.449
Yeah, but real men actually grow them.

05:57.556 --> 05:59.683
You know I have a hormone disorder!

06:05.231 --> 06:06.596
You'll see, Frank.

06:06.699 --> 06:09.930
One day, I'll punch you right in the face,
and then you'll respect me.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.766
I'll believe it when I see it, muchacho.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.475
Take out the trash.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.959
Nailed it.

06:39.165 --> 06:40.393
Rod?

06:43.302 --> 06:45.065
- Denise!
- Hey!

06:46.338 --> 06:47.430
How's it going?

06:47.540 --> 06:48.507
Oh.

06:48.774 --> 06:51.607
Great. Everything's going super great.

06:53.212 --> 06:54.236
You look different.

06:54.346 --> 06:57.372
Oh, really? Well, it's been a while.

06:57.950 --> 06:59.281
You look...

06:59.385 --> 07:01.182
You look pretty much exactly the same.

07:01.887 --> 07:03.582
Yeah. Thanks.

07:03.689 --> 07:05.384
And I see you're still doing your stunts.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.051
Big time.

07:08.060 --> 07:09.493
Actually...

07:09.595 --> 07:11.825
Here. Peep the strategy.

07:13.165 --> 07:15.998
You're jumping the pool? Wow!

07:16.102 --> 07:18.536
Yeah, it's the real deal.
You should come.

07:18.637 --> 07:20.730
Maybe I will. Thanks.

07:20.940 --> 07:21.907
Cool.

07:25.211 --> 07:29.875
Well, I gotta go. I gotta feed Buddy,
but very nice to see you, Rod.

07:29.982 --> 07:31.472
Yeah, you too.

07:33.385 --> 07:34.750
You look pretty.

07:34.854 --> 07:35.980
What did you say?

07:36.088 --> 07:39.148
I said you look shitty.
Good night, Denise.

08:03.249 --> 08:04.409
Hey, Pop.

08:04.750 --> 08:06.149
It's me, Rod.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.882
I sure wish you were alive.

08:09.255 --> 08:11.018
You'd tell me how much you respect me

08:11.123 --> 08:14.786
and we'd do stunts
and grow mustaches together.

08:15.961 --> 08:18.725
You may have died
an anonymous stuntman,

08:18.831 --> 08:21.231
but you live on through me.

08:25.738 --> 08:27.433
I miss you, Daddy.

08:28.674 --> 08:29.732
Hey, Rod?

08:29.842 --> 08:31.366
Get out!

08:34.613 --> 08:37.878
All right, everybody,
let's clear the pool.

08:37.982 --> 08:40.008
There's gonna be a jump.

08:40.119 --> 08:43.816
Come on, seriously, guys.
It's gonna be pretty amazing.

08:43.923 --> 08:46.983
Okeydoke, Rod. It's regulation size.

08:47.293 --> 08:49.989
Thanks, Rico.
Hey, have you seen Kevin anywhere?

08:50.429 --> 08:51.396
He's not here.

08:51.497 --> 08:53.124
What do you mean he's not here?
He's team manager.

08:53.232 --> 08:55.359
- He has to be here.
- I know, right?

08:59.972 --> 09:02.463
Richardson, out of the pool. Let's go.

09:02.575 --> 09:03.735
No can do, Dave.

09:03.842 --> 09:06.003
Come on, Richardson.
You're being a tool, man.

09:06.345 --> 09:09.337
There is no tool in this pool.

09:09.448 --> 09:13.350
And I'd happily get out,
if you let me join your crew.

09:13.953 --> 09:17.184
You can't join the crew, Richardson.
You don't do anything.

09:17.323 --> 09:18.347
Oh, don't I?

09:31.237 --> 09:32.363
You like what you see?

09:34.740 --> 09:35.729
Hey.

09:35.841 --> 09:37.103
Denise. Hey.

09:37.209 --> 09:39.939
Looks exciting.
Is there anything I can do to help?

09:40.045 --> 09:41.603
Oh, no, it's cool.

09:42.548 --> 09:43.674
Stop it!

09:43.782 --> 09:46.307
I think my crew's got it
pretty much covered.

09:47.453 --> 09:48.545
So...

09:51.590 --> 09:54.423
- Good luck.
- Don't worry, Denise.

09:55.561 --> 09:57.188
I've done this before.

10:18.183 --> 10:20.174
Totem spirit, fox.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.026
Please, God, don't let me
embarrass myself in front of Denise.

10:58.824 --> 11:00.155
Hello?

11:00.459 --> 11:01.721
I'm home.

11:02.394 --> 11:03.520
Kevin?

11:04.163 --> 11:05.960
You missed the jump.

11:06.532 --> 11:07.556
I totally landed it.

11:15.708 --> 11:18.176
Rod, thank goodness you're home.

11:18.811 --> 11:22.008
What's going on? Is this some sort of
interactive theater art piece?

11:22.114 --> 11:24.810
It's Frank. He's very sick.

11:24.917 --> 11:26.475
What? Since when?

11:26.585 --> 11:28.519
Since 21 years ago.

11:28.954 --> 11:30.546
It's his heart.

11:30.656 --> 11:33.750
He needs a transplant,
and our insurance won't cover it.

11:34.159 --> 11:37.595
They say he's too high-risk. Oh, Rod.

11:37.696 --> 11:39.664
He doesn't have much time left.

11:40.566 --> 11:41.624
No way.

11:41.734 --> 11:45.192
We would've told you sooner, but
we knew how much it would upset you.

11:45.304 --> 11:47.534
So, you just decided to keep me
and Kevin in the dark?

11:48.073 --> 11:52.032
Oh, no, we told Kevin.
We just didn't think you could handle it.

11:52.578 --> 11:54.546
I can handle it.

11:54.713 --> 11:58.376
I love you, Kevin.
I want you to have my watch.

11:59.184 --> 12:00.481
I love you, too, Dad.

12:00.586 --> 12:02.213
Hold on, Frank! Don't die!

12:02.588 --> 12:04.215
Let's let them talk.

12:04.323 --> 12:05.790
Sorry, boy. My time's up.

12:05.891 --> 12:08.724
But I still need to kick your ass.
How can I do that if you're dead?

12:08.827 --> 12:11.694
Well, then,
I guess I'll die still champion.

12:11.797 --> 12:14.925
No way. Let's do it right now.
One more for the road.

12:15.033 --> 12:18.469
Beating me wouldn't mean
anything now. I'm all through.

12:18.570 --> 12:22.165
All I want is to earn your respect, Frank.
How can I do that if you won't fight me?

12:22.274 --> 12:24.208
Well, maybe you should've
thought of that

12:24.309 --> 12:26.277
before you sucked at being a man
all your life.

12:26.378 --> 12:30.678
Oh, my God. I hate you so much,
I just wanna smash your face in.

12:30.783 --> 12:33.081
Too late. I'm a dead man.

12:34.720 --> 12:36.051
What about the transplant?

12:36.155 --> 12:39.215
Oh, sure. 50 grand.
You gonna pay for it?

12:39.324 --> 12:41.155
- No!
- 'Course you're not.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.455
Let's face it. You're a kid.

12:43.562 --> 12:46.030
You live at home. You got no job.

12:46.131 --> 12:49.623
All you're good for is goofing around
with your friends on your moped.

12:49.735 --> 12:53.569
You're wrong, Frank. I'm not a kid.
I'm a man.

12:53.672 --> 12:57.199
I am gonna get you better.
And then I'm gonna beat you to death!

12:57.676 --> 12:59.041
You couldn't beat a drum.

13:01.713 --> 13:04.807
- Rod, are you okay?
- I need to go to my quiet place!

14:23.028 --> 14:24.017
Shit!

15:14.947 --> 15:16.744
Oh, my God!

15:47.479 --> 15:49.003
And that is how it's done.

15:49.114 --> 15:50.342
Wow.

15:50.682 --> 15:51.671
It's amazing.

15:51.783 --> 15:52.841
That really hurt.

15:52.951 --> 15:55.010
Okay, you guys. Thanks for meeting me.

15:56.021 --> 15:58.387
As you all know, I recently found out
that my stepfather, Frank,

15:58.490 --> 16:00.481
is on his deathbed.

16:00.592 --> 16:04.995
I needed to think last night,
so I galloped into a wooded glen.

16:05.564 --> 16:07.532
And after punch-dancing out my rage

16:07.633 --> 16:11.034
and suffering an extremely long
and very painful fall,

16:12.504 --> 16:14.802
I realized what has to be done.

16:16.475 --> 16:19.035
We're gonna raise the money
to save Frank's life.

16:19.144 --> 16:20.611
Well, that's awesome, Rod,

16:20.712 --> 16:23.579
but how exactly
do you plan on doing that?

16:23.682 --> 16:25.343
One big jump, gentlemen.

16:25.717 --> 16:28.481
The biggest jump this town's ever seen.

16:28.587 --> 16:30.282
We're gonna jump 15 buses.

16:30.389 --> 16:32.016
Whoa. Come on, Rod.

16:32.124 --> 16:34.615
That's nearly as many
as Evel Knievel jumped.

16:34.726 --> 16:38.287
It's actually one more
than Evel Knievel jumped, Rico. I know.

16:38.397 --> 16:40.592
I checked. Online.

16:41.233 --> 16:44.532
Now, I've gotta be in top physical form
if we're gonna do this jump.

16:44.636 --> 16:46.467
- I'm sorry, Dave.
- What's that?

16:46.571 --> 16:47.697
Where are you going?

16:47.806 --> 16:51.833
I'm sorry, man. I just realized,
I'm late for work at the ice rink.

16:52.010 --> 16:54.035
- So, is that a problem?
- Yes.

16:54.146 --> 16:56.740
Now, this jump demands
that I be in top physical condition.

16:56.848 --> 16:58.839
I've already drafted
a rough schedule of exercises

16:58.950 --> 17:00.884
that will help us take things
to the next level.

17:00.986 --> 17:03.887
Once training is complete, we'll turn
our attention to funding the jump.

17:03.989 --> 17:06.958
By my estimations,
we'll need to raise around $5,000.

17:07.059 --> 17:08.856
That includes bus rentals,
ramp construction,

17:08.960 --> 17:10.188
team hats and wrist bands,

17:10.295 --> 17:12.023
and a $9 per diem
for each crew member.

17:12.130 --> 17:13.188
Now you're talking.

17:13.298 --> 17:15.095
We're gonna have to raise money fast.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.998
I'll drum up small-scale stunt work
at birthday parties.

17:18.103 --> 17:20.298
We're talking escape tricks,
fire breathing.

17:20.405 --> 17:22.066
Anything to please the rug rats.

17:22.174 --> 17:25.871
Also, we're gonna have to organize a
lot of shopping carts.

17:25.977 --> 17:30.641
And we're gonna go through some trash
for cans and newspaper to sleep on.

17:30.749 --> 17:32.944
Hey! What are you guys doing?

17:35.020 --> 17:36.146
Rod.

17:36.254 --> 17:39.189
Once we've raised the money,
we'll use it to put on the bus jump,

17:39.291 --> 17:42.283
make $50,000, and save Frank's life.

17:42.394 --> 17:43.520
Now, who's with me?

17:45.530 --> 17:46.827
Let's celebrate.

17:58.210 --> 17:59.734
Buddy. Come on.

18:10.155 --> 18:11.179
Hey, Rod.

18:13.625 --> 18:14.592
Oh.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.659
Denise, what's up?

18:16.762 --> 18:17.922
Not much.

18:19.030 --> 18:20.327
Funky fresh.

18:20.432 --> 18:23.629
I heard about your plan to save Frank.
I think that's great.

18:23.735 --> 18:28.069
Oh, yeah. I'm mainly just doing that
so I can kick his ass.

18:28.173 --> 18:29.435
Right.

18:29.541 --> 18:32.374
So, Denise, I think I know
why you came over here.

18:32.577 --> 18:34.772
- You do?
- Yeah.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.944
You wanna join my crew.

18:39.918 --> 18:42.614
I can't lie. I think it's a great idea.

18:43.121 --> 18:45.282
We could use someone
with your college experience.

18:45.390 --> 18:49.884
- Cool. I'd love to join.
- Whoa, whoa, Denise. Slow down.

18:49.995 --> 18:54.523
You can't just waltz in off the street
and demand to be in my crew.

18:54.633 --> 18:59.127
- But I thought you...
- Yeah, I know what you thought.

19:00.472 --> 19:04.499
But the fact is you can't join
until you go through initiation.

19:05.677 --> 19:07.201
All right. What's the initiation?

19:08.780 --> 19:10.213
It's crazy.

19:10.315 --> 19:13.478
It's like the craziest thing
you could even imagine.

19:13.585 --> 19:14.950
Okay.

19:15.053 --> 19:16.418
Here we go.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.485
Rod! Rod.

19:20.592 --> 19:21.684
Welcome aboard.

19:21.793 --> 19:24.387
I'm kind of grumpy today, dude.
I didn't get a lot of sleep last night.

19:24.496 --> 19:26.828
I was having those dreams again.

19:26.932 --> 19:30.959
You know how it's just me in a castle.
I gotta fight, like, a thousand wizards.

19:31.069 --> 19:34.004
The only way to beat them is to punch
them as hard as I can in their faces.

19:34.105 --> 19:36.903
And then, when I'm done,
all their little wizard wives came out

19:37.008 --> 19:38.908
and wanted me
just to have sex with them.

19:39.010 --> 19:40.204
Which is kind of weird.

19:40.312 --> 19:41.973
Hey, look at this, huh?

19:42.080 --> 19:44.844
Hey, everybody.
I've got some awesome news.

19:44.950 --> 19:47.646
We have a new crew member today.
Denise.

19:47.752 --> 19:49.151
Hi, everyone.

19:49.254 --> 19:50.812
So, I thought it'd be fun
if we all went around

19:50.922 --> 19:53.117
and said our name
and a little something about ourselves.

19:53.225 --> 19:56.251
I'll start. My name is Rod,

19:56.361 --> 19:58.124
and I like to party.

19:59.264 --> 20:00.891
All right, Dave. You're up.

20:00.999 --> 20:03.832
Hi. My name is Dave,

20:03.935 --> 20:06.631
and I like to party.

20:07.239 --> 20:10.504
No, Dave. I just said that I party, so
maybe do something different from me.

20:11.409 --> 20:15.038
My name is Dave,
and I am the stunt man.

20:15.146 --> 20:17.740
You know what? Let's move on.
Rico, you're up.

20:18.516 --> 20:21.610
Hello. I'm Rico, and I like to party.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.450
Yeah. Rico?
What did I just say to Dave?

20:24.723 --> 20:25.747
- Who?
- Dave.

20:25.857 --> 20:28.121
- I like to party. I'm Rod.
- No. You're Kevin.

20:28.226 --> 20:30.353
Right. Kevin. I party.

20:30.462 --> 20:33.454
No. No, you don't.
Okay, nobody parties but me.

20:33.565 --> 20:35.430
Yes. And we party.

20:35.533 --> 20:36.830
- No.
- Yeah, just Rod.

20:36.935 --> 20:38.027
- Yes.
- And me.

20:38.136 --> 20:41.594
- No! I'm the only one who parties.
- I'm pretty sure I've partied before.

20:41.706 --> 20:44.869
No, Kevin, I know for a fact
you don't party, okay? You do not party.

20:44.976 --> 20:47.410
- You're right. Dave's the party guy.
- Sweet.

20:47.512 --> 20:51.073
Oh, my God. Shut up, okay?
I'm just gonna do it for you.

20:51.182 --> 20:53.582
Denise. This is the crew.

20:53.685 --> 20:56.176
Dave's the mechanic.
Rico makes the ramps.

20:56.288 --> 20:58.415
And Kevin is
team manager/videographer.

20:58.523 --> 21:00.548
None of them party. Right?

21:01.393 --> 21:02.758
Got it?

21:02.861 --> 21:03.953
Okay.

21:05.063 --> 21:06.462
Let's party.

21:07.098 --> 21:10.090
Pools are perfect
for holding water, man.

21:11.603 --> 21:14.970
Man, I don't really know about having
a girl on the team, man.

21:15.874 --> 21:17.569
All right, Rico, listen.

21:17.676 --> 21:21.737
There's an ancient Italian maxim
that roughly translates to,

21:22.447 --> 21:27.248
"He who is resistant to change
is destined to perish."

21:27.819 --> 21:30.344
So, why don't you try to open up
that mind of yours? You know?

21:30.455 --> 21:32.787
It's like, look at Kevin. I mean, he...

21:33.558 --> 21:34.616
Real mature, man.

21:34.726 --> 21:36.694
Yeah, don't you ever tell me
how to live my life again.

21:39.397 --> 21:40.489
Okay, you guys.

21:40.598 --> 21:44.227
If I'm gonna jump 15 buses, my body's
gonna have to be in top physical form.

21:44.336 --> 21:47.430
Which brings us to our first exercise.
Lung strengthening.

21:47.539 --> 21:49.905
You guys are gonna hold me
under water for 40 seconds.

21:50.008 --> 21:51.703
That's 20 less than a minute.

21:51.810 --> 21:54.005
My body's natural instinct
is gonna be to resist.

21:54.112 --> 21:56.979
But, no matter what, don't let up.

21:57.082 --> 22:00.449
If there's any problem at all,
I will ring this bell.

22:23.441 --> 22:25.966
Hey, Dave. Mom wants to know
if your friends want some grape punch.

22:26.077 --> 22:29.137
Maggie! Don't even ask. Just bring it.
Come on.

22:30.181 --> 22:33.150
Don't just stare at me! Go! Thank you.

22:37.322 --> 22:39.586
Soul of a bottlenose dolphin.

22:57.976 --> 22:59.000
Hey, y'all.

22:59.110 --> 23:02.170
Mom said there wasn't enough grape,
so it's mixed with cherry. Is that okay?

23:02.280 --> 23:04.271
Yeah, fine, Maggie. Put it on the table.

23:04.382 --> 23:05.406
Which table?

23:05.517 --> 23:08.077
You tell me, Brainiac.
It's your front yard, too.

23:08.186 --> 23:11.986
Hey, little girl! I don't want cherry.
It upsets my stomach!

23:12.524 --> 23:17.393
37, 38, 39, 40. Okay. Let him up.

23:19.564 --> 23:22.192
Get him out, get him out, get him out!

23:23.201 --> 23:24.759
Get him up, get him up.

23:28.239 --> 23:29.968
Rod, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

23:30.075 --> 23:31.736
Come on, Rod.

23:37.615 --> 23:38.809
- Nice.
- Oh, God.

23:40.251 --> 23:42.116
- Oh, man.
- What happened?

23:42.220 --> 23:44.711
You almost drowned. Denise just gave
you mouth-to-mouth and saved you.

23:48.626 --> 23:50.617
Did it look like we were making out?

23:51.563 --> 23:52.894
A little bit.

23:52.997 --> 23:54.225
Awesome.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.295
Are you okay?

23:58.236 --> 24:00.602
Oh. Hey, Denise. What's up?

24:00.705 --> 24:03.697
Great. I'm just gonna go wash off
this puke from my face.

24:03.808 --> 24:04.797
Cool.

24:07.712 --> 24:09.339
Speed management.

24:09.714 --> 24:10.976
G force.

24:11.483 --> 24:12.973
Let's run it.

24:18.923 --> 24:21.118
My safe word will be whiskey.

24:21.759 --> 24:23.522
Sorry, Rod. What was that?

24:24.195 --> 24:25.457
Whiskey.

24:25.864 --> 24:27.058
Don't you mean whiskey?

24:27.765 --> 24:28.789
What?

24:28.900 --> 24:31.061
- You're saying it weird.
- Saying what weird?

24:31.169 --> 24:32.158
All of it.

24:33.872 --> 24:35.601
Where do you get off?

24:35.707 --> 24:37.436
I just don't get
why you're saying it that way.

24:37.542 --> 24:39.635
Why I'm saying what what way?

24:39.744 --> 24:42.474
- Forget it.
- I will. I will forget it.

24:43.882 --> 24:46.851
Denise. Would you kindly clear
the wheels?

24:50.255 --> 24:52.519
Okay, here we go. On three.

24:53.391 --> 24:54.551
One,

24:55.426 --> 24:57.257
- two...
- Whoa, whiskey!

24:57.362 --> 24:58.852
Whiskey!

24:58.963 --> 25:01.591
Whiskey!

25:01.699 --> 25:03.326
Whiskey!

25:03.434 --> 25:05.493
Whiskey!

25:06.971 --> 25:08.302
Oh, shit!

25:12.210 --> 25:13.336
Rod!

25:13.945 --> 25:15.105
Are you okay?

25:15.213 --> 25:16.874
The safety word didn't help.

25:16.981 --> 25:18.346
My trailer! What the hell?

25:18.449 --> 25:21.179
One of you is getting
your dick-hole smashed!

25:24.989 --> 25:29.085
I'm freaking pumped! I've been drinking
green tea all goddamn day!

25:29.460 --> 25:30.427
Oh!

25:30.595 --> 25:32.756
Man, he hit his ass
with a parking cone. Nice!

25:32.864 --> 25:35.560
God, I go to church
every goddamn Sunday!

25:35.667 --> 25:36.998
You gonna bring the demons out of me!

25:37.101 --> 25:38.466
- All right, Rico. You got him.
- Rico.

25:38.570 --> 25:41.334
Not with the trash can, buddy.
No, no, come on.

25:41.439 --> 25:43.839
- Trash!
- All right, let's get him off of him.

25:43.942 --> 25:46.308
- Okay, okay, okay.
- No, no. No!

25:47.579 --> 25:49.376
This is my hat, now.

25:49.480 --> 25:51.607
This is totally my hat.

26:00.191 --> 26:01.522
Thanks.

26:03.861 --> 26:07.058
So, how do you like
being in the crew so far?

26:07.699 --> 26:10.463
- It's been interesting.
- Told you.

26:13.571 --> 26:14.799
Stop it.

26:16.941 --> 26:18.340
Hey, Denise?

26:19.911 --> 26:21.902
There's something I wanted to ask you.

26:22.013 --> 26:23.139
Yeah?

26:24.082 --> 26:25.310
Well...

26:26.384 --> 26:30.013
I couldn't help but notice
that we've both matured a lot,

26:30.455 --> 26:31.820
physically.

26:32.957 --> 26:35.858
And I was just wondering if maybe...

26:35.960 --> 26:37.825
Hey, Rod. What's that song called,

26:37.929 --> 26:39.590
about the grandma
getting run over by a reindeer?

26:41.032 --> 26:43.933
Grandma Got Run Over
by a Reindeer?

26:44.035 --> 26:45.263
No.

26:46.871 --> 26:48.634
Jonathan.

26:51.376 --> 26:53.537
Hey, what are you doing?
I thought you were at work.

26:53.645 --> 26:56.409
Wanted to come by
and surprise my little girl.

26:59.117 --> 27:00.516
Hey, guys.

27:00.618 --> 27:03.052
This is Jonathan.
He's visiting from the city.

27:03.154 --> 27:05.122
- What's up, fellas?
- I'm gonna grab my jacket.

27:05.223 --> 27:06.190
Okay.

27:11.129 --> 27:12.528
So, what are you supposed to be?

27:13.631 --> 27:15.064
A stuntman.

27:17.302 --> 27:18.530
How about you, precious?

27:19.871 --> 27:21.634
I'm a team manager.

27:23.841 --> 27:24.967
Wow.

27:26.477 --> 27:27.774
Ready.

27:28.079 --> 27:29.740
Have a nice day, guys.

27:30.448 --> 27:31.415
Bye.

27:31.649 --> 27:34.812
Oh. Rod, what were you gonna ask me?

27:34.919 --> 27:36.978
Oh, right.

27:37.088 --> 27:39.989
I was going to ask you
who you think would win

27:40.091 --> 27:44.494
in a fight between
a grilled cheese sandwich

27:44.996 --> 27:46.964
and a taco.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.168
Is that really what you were gonna ask?

27:51.269 --> 27:52.327
Yes.

27:55.173 --> 27:57.368
Grilled cheese. But only in a fair fight.

27:57.475 --> 27:59.773
If it's prison rules, I'd take the taco.

27:59.877 --> 28:04.177
Wow. That's pretty racist, but correct.

28:04.282 --> 28:06.216
I'll see you guys.

28:17.995 --> 28:20.156
You know what car is super-overrated?

28:20.264 --> 28:22.323
- What?
- Corvette.

28:23.234 --> 28:24.861
You mean, like the one
Jonathan was driving?

28:26.437 --> 28:28.564
Is that what he was driving?

28:29.540 --> 28:31.440
Must've been what reminded me.

28:31.542 --> 28:33.908
I don't know,
I thought it was kind of cool.

28:34.011 --> 28:36.605
Okay, boys. Now, this is the first time

28:36.714 --> 28:39.740
your father's feeling well enough
to sit with us at the dinner table.

28:39.851 --> 28:44.379
So I want everyone to promise me,
no fighting.

28:45.923 --> 28:48.448
What're you looking at me for?
Kevin could fight him.

28:48.559 --> 28:50.686
- I promise not to fight him.
- Thank you, Kevin.

28:50.795 --> 28:52.422
- Rod?
- Fine, I promise.

28:52.530 --> 28:53.588
Thank you.

28:55.566 --> 28:56.658
Hi, Kevin.

28:56.768 --> 28:57.928
Hey, Dad.

28:58.035 --> 29:00.196
Thank you, dear.

29:02.106 --> 29:03.266
Frank.

29:08.379 --> 29:09.812
So, Frank.

29:09.914 --> 29:12.815
I'm sure you've heard the plan
to get you a new heart is going great.

29:12.917 --> 29:14.111
Nope.

29:14.218 --> 29:15.651
Well, it is.

29:15.753 --> 29:17.345
You can say thanks, if you wanted.

29:17.455 --> 29:19.082
No, I'm good.

29:20.691 --> 29:22.522
I know what you're doing, Frank.

29:22.627 --> 29:24.595
You're trying to make me lose
my temper.

29:24.695 --> 29:26.754
But it's not gonna happen.

29:26.864 --> 29:30.095
I'm afraid cooler heads have prevailed.

29:30.601 --> 29:32.228
You're the devil!

29:33.538 --> 29:35.096
All right! That's enough.

29:35.206 --> 29:36.833
Frank, back to bed.

29:36.941 --> 29:38.465
Rod, outside.

29:38.576 --> 29:39.702
Fine.

29:40.244 --> 29:41.871
Have fun being married to Satan!

30:08.406 --> 30:09.896
Nice work, Rico!

30:22.153 --> 30:26.317
So, Denise. Tell me about Jonathan.
What's that dude all about?

30:27.058 --> 30:30.152
Well, we've been going out
for about a year.

30:30.461 --> 30:32.861
- And it's going well?
- Yeah. Yeah.

30:32.997 --> 30:36.194
I mean, every relationship has
its ups and downs, but...

30:36.300 --> 30:37.927
Right. I've heard that.

30:38.035 --> 30:40.003
And he's a nice guy?

30:40.104 --> 30:42.629
Oh, yeah. I mean, he's really smart.

30:42.740 --> 30:45.903
He's actually in line to become
a junior partner at his law firm.

30:46.010 --> 30:48.808
Right. Totally.
You guys should break up.

30:48.913 --> 30:51.040
- What?
- Nothing. Hey, Dave's back.

30:51.148 --> 30:54.117
You guys, the bathroom here is nuts.

30:58.489 --> 30:59.820
What do I owe you?

30:59.924 --> 31:01.983
$7.25.

31:30.021 --> 31:31.454
So,

31:32.857 --> 31:33.881
hi.

31:33.991 --> 31:36.391
$2.39's your change. Thank you.

31:37.662 --> 31:40.529
We don't talk much, do we?
Cathy, was it?

31:41.132 --> 31:43.225
I'm Rod. I do awesome stunts.

31:43.334 --> 31:46.269
All the time, with my friends.
You probably didn't know that.

31:46.370 --> 31:49.134
And you probably have lots of cool stuff
about you that I don't know.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.868
The point is, if you don't sit down
with someone and really talk

31:51.976 --> 31:53.773
and get to know them,
you never find those things out.

31:54.512 --> 31:58.073
So, what do you say?
You wanna make this thing official?

31:58.182 --> 32:00.082
Are you asking me out?

32:03.487 --> 32:04.977
Oh, Cathy!

32:09.727 --> 32:11.558
Wow, Rod. I can't believe she said yes.

32:11.662 --> 32:15.359
Yeah, well, you have only to believe if
you wish to achieve, Kevin.

32:15.466 --> 32:17.263
That rhymed. Unintentional.

32:17.368 --> 32:21.532
Man, Rod. I am just green
with jealous rage right now.

32:21.839 --> 32:23.932
- She's really pretty.
- I know, D.

32:24.041 --> 32:27.033
But it's more than that with Cathy.
It's emotional.

32:27.144 --> 32:28.839
She really gets me.

32:28.946 --> 32:31.312
Tell you what. Why don't you grab
that brainy beau of yours

32:31.415 --> 32:33.178
and we'll make it a double date.

32:33.284 --> 32:34.273
Really?

32:34.385 --> 32:37.149
- Sure.
- Okay. That sounds like fun.

32:37.254 --> 32:40.849
Great, because I also think
it sounds like fun.

32:41.292 --> 32:42.418
A lot.

32:52.169 --> 32:53.466
Frank.

32:54.705 --> 32:56.332
I know you're sleeping,

32:56.440 --> 33:00.501
but I just wanted you to know
that training is going really great.

33:01.679 --> 33:03.670
My reflexes are sharp.

33:04.782 --> 33:06.773
I'm crazy agile.

33:07.718 --> 33:09.913
And I have a date.

33:12.423 --> 33:15.051
So, anyways, that's the update.

33:16.727 --> 33:18.388
Sleep tight.

33:19.997 --> 33:21.897
Who are you talking to?

33:24.201 --> 33:27.034
Oh, when you're going on a date

33:27.138 --> 33:28.765
You put on a shirt

33:28.873 --> 33:33.105
And you drive your bike to the date

33:40.818 --> 33:43.218
Looks like you got stood up, huh?

33:43.788 --> 33:45.415
No, she's coming.

33:45.790 --> 33:46.882
Okay.

33:47.458 --> 33:49.016
Hey, guys, can I take your order?

33:49.126 --> 33:50.525
No, we're actually waiting for...

33:50.628 --> 33:52.892
Yeah, we'll take
three Flaming Dr. Peppers.

33:52.997 --> 33:54.055
Okay.

33:54.165 --> 33:55.598
So, Super Dave.

33:55.700 --> 33:58.396
Denise tells me you're working on
some pretty big-time stuff.

33:58.502 --> 34:01.232
Yeah, well, I been doing stunts
since I was a kid,

34:01.338 --> 34:03.636
so it's not really a big deal to me.

34:03.741 --> 34:05.641
Yeah, me neither.
I was just being polite.

34:05.743 --> 34:07.370
But thanks for letting me off the hook.

34:07.478 --> 34:08.536
Jonathan.

34:08.646 --> 34:09.670
Here we go.

34:09.780 --> 34:11.371
Oh, speak of diablo.

34:11.482 --> 34:13.347
Bombs away.

34:17.755 --> 34:20.485
Boom! There's the flavor!

34:26.063 --> 34:28.690
So, how's your mom holding up, Rod?

34:28.799 --> 34:31.666
Oh, pretty good, I guess.

34:31.768 --> 34:34.498
I mean, sometimes I think
she's really sad.

34:34.605 --> 34:37.768
Holy shit, is that Sullivan? Sully!

34:37.875 --> 34:40.172
- Bro, no way!
- No way, Sully.

34:40.277 --> 34:41.938
Babe, I gotta say "what up" to Sullivan.

34:42.045 --> 34:43.172
- Okay.
- Sweet.

34:43.280 --> 34:46.716
Hey. Don't you two go falling in love
while I'm gone.

34:48.085 --> 34:49.313
Like that'll happen.

34:49.420 --> 34:52.685
Sullivan, you chode!
I owe you a shot to the nuts!

34:56.260 --> 34:58.854
Maybe you should call her, Rod.
Just check in.

34:58.963 --> 35:02.660
Nah. She hates it
when I try and keep tabs on her. So...

35:09.573 --> 35:11.006
Hey, Denise?

35:11.108 --> 35:13.338
Have I ever showed you a picture
of my dead dad?

35:13.444 --> 35:15.708
- No.
- Oh, you've gotta see it.

35:15.813 --> 35:17.303
He's super dead.

35:21.185 --> 35:22.709
- That's him?
- Yeah.

35:23.587 --> 35:25.248
He looks so nice.

35:25.623 --> 35:26.817
He was a stuntman?

35:26.924 --> 35:28.653
Oh, yeah.

35:28.993 --> 35:33.157
He used to work for Evel Knievel,
testing his bikes before big jumps.

35:33.264 --> 35:34.959
He would do the jumps first,
to make sure they were safe

35:35.065 --> 35:38.159
and then let Evel come in
and get all the glory.

35:39.270 --> 35:40.999
And, after a while, the old man said,

35:41.105 --> 35:44.268
"To hell with that.
I want the credit I deserve."

35:45.309 --> 35:48.972
So, one afternoon,
he set out to jump ten milk trucks.

35:50.014 --> 35:54.713
He nailed the takeoff, but when he
landed, something terrible happened.

35:55.686 --> 35:58.416
His front tire exploded like a cannonball

35:58.522 --> 36:01.719
and his handlebars went
straight through his head.

36:02.059 --> 36:03.856
Blood was everywhere.

36:04.595 --> 36:07.223
His teeth were ground down to a powder

36:08.265 --> 36:12.065
and the front of his face exploded
out the back of his skull.

36:14.505 --> 36:16.336
He died instantly,

36:17.575 --> 36:19.167
the next day.

36:19.543 --> 36:21.135
That's horrible.

36:21.478 --> 36:22.843
I know.

36:22.947 --> 36:23.914
When my mom married Frank,

36:24.014 --> 36:27.575
I kept my dad's last name
to honor his memory.

36:28.419 --> 36:32.412
And every time I do a stunt,
I know he's watching.

36:38.762 --> 36:42.698
Okay, people, training's going great,
but Frank's running out of time.

36:42.800 --> 36:44.893
So I'm officially kicking off phase two,

36:45.069 --> 36:47.697
Operation Fiscal Jackhammer.

36:48.305 --> 36:51.741
Starting right now, we're gonna fill
this jug with 5 grand.

36:51.842 --> 36:53.207
Let's work!

37:29.546 --> 37:32.242
- All right. Who has the keys?
- Oh, man.

37:32.349 --> 37:33.816
Rod, we're gonna be right there!

37:33.918 --> 37:35.476
Oh, my God. Find them, find them!

37:39.390 --> 37:41.017
I found the key.

37:42.293 --> 37:44.022
They grow up so fast.

37:44.128 --> 37:45.652
Get the fuck off my porch.

37:45.763 --> 37:47.031
Sounds good.

38:48.926 --> 38:50.393
Oh, no, Kevin!

38:58.702 --> 39:02.536
For he's a jolly good fellow

39:02.639 --> 39:05.802
For he's a jolly good fellow

39:05.909 --> 39:08.537
For he's a jolly good fellow

39:08.645 --> 39:10.340
- Is everything ready?
- Now?

39:10.447 --> 39:12.472
- No, not now!
- Blow it now!

39:26.864 --> 39:29.389
- You're a terrible stuntman.
- What?

39:30.367 --> 39:32.858
- You're a terrible stuntman!
- What?

39:33.203 --> 39:35.228
You're a terrible stuntman!

39:35.339 --> 39:38.934
I'm just kidding. I can hear you.
It was just really mean.

39:40.744 --> 39:44.646
Tai chi teaches that if you focus
your body and mind,

39:45.649 --> 39:49.949
you'll be able to perform
at the peak of your abilities.

39:50.421 --> 39:51.786
Yes, sensei.

39:51.889 --> 39:54.221
You don't have to call me sensei, Rod.

39:54.758 --> 39:55.952
Got it.

39:57.761 --> 40:00.025
Sensei, I have a question.

40:00.130 --> 40:01.222
Is there a tai chi move

40:01.331 --> 40:04.232
that would make a grown man
crap his pants, and not know why?

40:04.334 --> 40:07.929
I'm not gonna lie to you, Rod.
That move does exist.

40:08.572 --> 40:10.870
But you're not ready for it yet.

40:11.842 --> 40:13.935
As you wish, sensei.

40:14.044 --> 40:18.140
Now we take the ball
and we push the ball away.

40:19.383 --> 40:20.941
Yeah, we could.

40:21.885 --> 40:26.049
Or you could cut the kiddie stuff
and show me the crap-yourself move.

40:34.698 --> 40:36.495
That didn't work.

40:37.568 --> 40:40.537
Anyways, I'm gonna get going, so,

40:41.238 --> 40:44.969
take it easy.
I'm gonna go see what Frank's doing.

40:45.075 --> 40:46.599
You wanted to see it, Rod.

40:46.710 --> 40:50.737
Yeah, I did want you to show me,
and you didn't, 'cause it didn't work.

40:50.848 --> 40:53.817
So now I'm gonna go, 'cause
there's nothing left for me to learn.

40:53.917 --> 40:57.114
Thank you, though, for trying.
That was very nice of you to try.

40:58.422 --> 41:03.052
Please believe
I do my laundry with no pants on

41:07.965 --> 41:09.762
Hey, half-brother.

41:09.867 --> 41:11.164
What you working on?

41:11.268 --> 41:14.101
- Nothing. I'm just messing around.
- Oh, yeah?

41:14.204 --> 41:15.466
Let's take a look.

41:15.572 --> 41:18.097
- Okay, but it's not really finished, so...
- Got it.

41:21.612 --> 41:24.604
That's something else
that I'm working on. For Mom.

41:24.715 --> 41:26.376
- Not for me.
- Right.

41:26.483 --> 41:27.950
Mom likes that stuff, so...

41:28.051 --> 41:29.541
Here's the right one.

41:36.460 --> 41:37.586
Dominique Wilkins.

41:44.101 --> 41:47.002
I'm Rod Kimble,
stuntman extraordinaire.

41:51.508 --> 41:52.805
Life is short.

41:59.349 --> 42:01.783
- That's it.
- Holy moly, Kev-bot.

42:02.386 --> 42:04.286
- That was beautiful.
- You liked it?

42:04.388 --> 42:06.356
Are you kidding me? I loved it!

42:06.456 --> 42:08.390
You're the next
Douglas Bubbletrousers!

42:08.492 --> 42:10.016
Wow, Rod. Thanks.

42:10.127 --> 42:14.188
Kevin, I just had a great idea.

43:24.401 --> 43:25.834
Hey, Frank.

43:25.936 --> 43:27.494
It's me, Rod.

43:28.171 --> 43:32.107
I just wanted to let you know,
we've already raised over $3,000.

43:32.209 --> 43:34.234
Soon, I'll jump 15 buses

43:34.778 --> 43:37.372
and then I'm gonna kick your ass.

43:40.450 --> 43:44.511
I'm gonna assume you're laughing
at some funny dream you're having.

43:44.621 --> 43:46.782
You're a pussy.

43:47.924 --> 43:49.983
What is that, sleep-talking?

43:50.093 --> 43:51.287
You suck.

43:51.395 --> 43:54.057
Frank, open your eyes.
You are not asleep!

43:54.164 --> 43:57.600
I am asleep, homo.

43:58.535 --> 44:01.902
Oh, it's so good to see him
smiling again.

44:03.540 --> 44:06.839
Yeah! And you know what
won't make him smile?

44:08.011 --> 44:09.945
When I murder him!

44:14.785 --> 44:17.913
And I am genuinely sorry
about the window!

44:18.689 --> 44:21.089
Enjoy the show. Hey, how are you?

44:21.792 --> 44:22.759
Enjoy the show.

44:27.597 --> 44:29.929
Yeah, I have various responsibilities
within the crew, you know.

44:30.033 --> 44:34.265
I'm kind of a jack-of-all-trades, really.
I one time manned a flamethrower.

44:34.371 --> 44:35.395
Cool.

44:35.505 --> 44:38.065
Of course it's cool.
It's awesome as shit.

44:38.175 --> 44:41.406
Here you go, Mr. And Mrs. Powell.
Front row seats.

44:41.511 --> 44:42.944
I hope you all enjoy the show.

44:43.046 --> 44:45.344
I can assure you I won't.

44:45.449 --> 44:47.110
- Thank you, Rico.
- Okay.

44:47.217 --> 44:48.650
Goodbye, Rico.

44:49.052 --> 44:50.952
Hey, I just did the numbers.

44:51.054 --> 44:54.217
We sold 200 tickets at 5 bucks apiece,
which comes to $1,000.

44:54.324 --> 44:56.451
Now, you add that to the money
from the birthday parties,

44:56.560 --> 44:58.357
and it's over $4,900.

44:58.462 --> 45:00.896
Rod, we're really gonna do this jump.

45:00.997 --> 45:03.727
Of course we are, Kevin.
We're geniuses!

45:05.836 --> 45:07.326
Oh, heads up.

45:08.038 --> 45:09.027
Oh, man.

45:52.849 --> 45:54.510
This guy's a moron!

45:54.618 --> 45:55.642
Shut up!

46:00.257 --> 46:01.781
You suck!

46:06.997 --> 46:09.158
We're all laughing at Rod!

46:12.102 --> 46:13.729
The devil's lies

46:14.805 --> 46:19.174
Run, red man
Run for your life

46:22.145 --> 46:26.206
Oh, my God. Bear.
No, there's a bear. Bear!

46:26.950 --> 46:28.611
Kevin, turn it off!

46:29.352 --> 46:31.752
- Rod...
- I said, turn it off!

46:32.989 --> 46:35.184
I try to drink at least two a day.

46:37.394 --> 46:39.658
Oh, yeah!

46:41.164 --> 46:42.222
My Native American healer...

46:47.337 --> 46:48.964
Hey, what happened to the crazy movie!

46:49.072 --> 46:51.165
Take it easy! Whoa, whoa.

46:52.409 --> 46:53.877
What the hell was that all about?

46:53.877 --> 46:54.104
What the hell was that all about?

46:54.211 --> 46:56.543
Rod, I'm sorry.
I don't know what they're laughing at.

46:56.646 --> 46:58.273
Your video made me look like an idiot!

46:58.381 --> 47:01.578
- I didn't mean to.
- What was it, Kev? Jealousy?

47:01.685 --> 47:04.654
You couldn't take everyone loving
my stunts and thinking you're short?

47:04.754 --> 47:06.517
- I'm not short.
- Yes, you are!

47:06.623 --> 47:08.056
No, I'm not!

47:08.458 --> 47:09.948
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, guys.

47:10.060 --> 47:11.118
- Oh, you guys.
- Come on, they're serious,

47:11.228 --> 47:12.661
let them work it out.
Let them work it out.

47:12.762 --> 47:13.729
Let them work it out.

47:15.432 --> 47:17.764
Okay, I'm out. Peace, I'm out.

47:19.236 --> 47:21.067
What do you want?

47:42.993 --> 47:44.858
Come sit down, honey.

47:51.601 --> 47:53.193
I failed, Mom.

47:53.637 --> 47:57.129
I lost all the money
and people laughed at my stunts.

47:57.240 --> 47:59.834
Dad would've been ashamed of me.

48:00.777 --> 48:03.211
Rod, there's something
I have to tell you.

48:04.114 --> 48:06.742
Something that I should've told you
a long time ago.

48:06.850 --> 48:08.044
What?

48:08.151 --> 48:12.019
I haven't been completely honest
with you about your father.

48:12.722 --> 48:15.020
You see, he wasn't a stuntman.

48:15.659 --> 48:16.819
What?

48:16.927 --> 48:19.259
He was a cashier in a tire shop.

48:20.830 --> 48:22.923
But what about the picture?

48:23.033 --> 48:24.762
It was just a picture.

48:24.868 --> 48:28.998
Evel Knievel came to town, and
he posed with everyone in the store.

48:30.574 --> 48:31.836
You lied.

48:31.942 --> 48:34.001
You had such an imagination as a boy,

48:34.110 --> 48:35.600
and when you saw that picture

48:35.712 --> 48:38.681
you started to make up
these wonderful stories.

48:38.782 --> 48:42.240
And I didn't have the heart to tell you
it wasn't true.

48:42.552 --> 48:44.782
You have to believe me.
I did it out of love.

48:46.122 --> 48:47.885
So, how did he die?

48:47.991 --> 48:49.822
He choked on some pie.

48:49.926 --> 48:52.554
What? Come on. Seriously?

48:52.662 --> 48:55.187
He wanted to win that contest so badly.

48:55.799 --> 48:56.766
Well,

48:58.001 --> 49:01.528
I guess if he wasn't a stuntman,
then neither am I.

49:02.272 --> 49:03.466
Rod.

49:04.474 --> 49:05.702
Rod!

49:07.177 --> 49:09.111
You did the right thing, honey.

49:41.211 --> 49:42.610
There he is.

49:42.712 --> 49:44.475
Rod! Hey, Rod!

49:44.581 --> 49:45.843
Hold it right there, Rod.

49:45.949 --> 49:48.782
What in the hell
do you think you're doing?

49:48.885 --> 49:50.284
Grocery shopping.

49:50.387 --> 49:52.048
I don't understand, Rod.

49:52.155 --> 49:56.421
I'm not a stuntman, Dave. I never was.
Just a normal dude.

49:56.593 --> 49:59.391
Well, what the hell are we supposed to
do, huh? Where's that leave us?

49:59.496 --> 50:00.986
I dunno, Rico. You tell me.

50:01.097 --> 50:03.327
What ever happened to
"Live as a team, die as a team?"

50:03.433 --> 50:06.459
It's a sham, okay?
There's no such thing as a team.

50:06.569 --> 50:07.763
You live and die alone.

50:07.871 --> 50:11.602
Do you see what you're doing to him?
You're making him upset.

50:11.708 --> 50:13.471
How important is this to you? Huh?

50:13.576 --> 50:15.407
I don't even cry, and look at me.

50:15.512 --> 50:17.537
You're about to make
tears come out of my face.

50:17.647 --> 50:19.410
I'm sorry, okay?
This isn't what I wanted.

50:19.516 --> 50:21.416
Who am I supposed to build ramps for?

50:21.518 --> 50:24.316
Who am I supposed to
build ramps for now?

50:26.423 --> 50:28.254
I just wanna be friends, Rod.

50:30.293 --> 50:32.056
I want us to...

50:32.662 --> 50:34.095
For serious.

50:40.303 --> 50:42.931
You wanna know
why I joined the crew, Rod?

50:43.039 --> 50:44.631
It's 'cause ever since we were kids,

50:44.741 --> 50:47.904
you've always done exactly
what you wanted to do.

50:48.344 --> 50:53.043
And everybody else just grew up,
and got boring, and sold out.

50:53.149 --> 50:55.743
But you stayed exactly the same.

50:55.852 --> 50:57.717
Who cares what anyone thinks?

50:57.821 --> 51:01.154
You don't get it, do you, Denise?
I used to be legit.

51:02.292 --> 51:04.658
In fact, I was too legit.

51:04.761 --> 51:06.922
I was too legit to quit.

51:07.030 --> 51:09.521
But now I'm not legit.

51:09.632 --> 51:11.566
I'm un-legit.

51:11.668 --> 51:14.102
And for that reason, I must quit.

51:14.204 --> 51:15.262
You don't mean that.

51:15.371 --> 51:16.736
Yeah. I do.

51:18.675 --> 51:20.040
Stay sweet.

51:49.839 --> 51:53.138
- Hello?
- Rod. Hey, buddy, it's Dave.

51:53.943 --> 51:56.002
- From the crew.
- Yeah?

51:56.112 --> 51:57.340
Hey, man, what's going on, man?

51:57.447 --> 52:00.439
I just, you know, wanted to call,
see how you're doing.

52:00.550 --> 52:03.018
Maybe you'd wanna hang out,
you know?

52:03.119 --> 52:04.916
Possibly take me to the hospital?

52:05.021 --> 52:07.649
- You know? If you're free.
- Is everything okay?

52:07.757 --> 52:10.658
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man.
Everything's great.

52:10.760 --> 52:14.059
No, no. But, you know, it's probably
just precautionary, you know.

52:14.164 --> 52:15.563
If you just wanna swing by, man,

52:15.665 --> 52:17.098
I'd totally appreciate it.

52:17.200 --> 52:20.135
Yeah, sure. Just give me a minute.

52:20.670 --> 52:23.662
Rod, thank you so much...

52:40.790 --> 52:42.781
Hey, Rod. Thanks for the ride...

52:44.427 --> 52:45.724
Hey, buddy, how's it going?

52:45.829 --> 52:48.161
Dave, what happened to your eye?

52:48.264 --> 52:49.390
- This?
- Yeah.

52:49.499 --> 52:51.262
- Is it really noticeable?
- Yeah.

52:51.367 --> 52:55.770
Oh, man, it's totally serendipitous.
Well, I got off work early.

52:55.872 --> 52:58.773
And you know my buddy, Derrick?
Well, he was like...

52:58.875 --> 53:02.140
"I've got this acid, but I can't do it."

53:02.245 --> 53:03.269
And I was all like,

53:03.379 --> 53:05.472
"Well, I'll do it."

53:06.482 --> 53:08.040
So I did it.

53:09.285 --> 53:12.721
And by the time I got on
my banana board, man, I was...

53:12.922 --> 53:15.891
I was tripping balls pretty hard, man.

53:17.193 --> 53:19.718
So, I decided to get on my
bench grinder

53:19.829 --> 53:22.923
and a piece of metal flew up
and hit me right in the eye.

53:23.032 --> 53:24.260
It was pretty awesome.

53:24.367 --> 53:26.562
And that brings us to now.

53:26.669 --> 53:29.832
Yeah, well, just try and relax.

53:30.506 --> 53:33.031
Can do, man. Can do.

53:36.112 --> 53:38.171
I'm gonna be honest with you, Rod.

53:38.381 --> 53:42.374
You look like a giant eagle
with fire all around you

53:42.886 --> 53:45.821
and you've got a mountain for a face.

53:45.922 --> 53:47.822
I'm guessing that's the drugs, Dave.

53:47.924 --> 53:50.893
Yeah, but it's also just kind of weird
seeing you drive this minivan.

53:50.994 --> 53:54.088
Yeah, well, it's my mom's.

53:56.199 --> 53:57.860
Balls, man!

53:58.835 --> 54:00.700
Man, we just ran over a small bus.

54:00.803 --> 54:02.737
This really small bus,
we just ran over it.

54:02.839 --> 54:04.101
I didn't see anything.

54:04.207 --> 54:06.232
Hey, we're here.

54:06.342 --> 54:08.674
Seriously, man, this is, like,

54:08.778 --> 54:12.441
one of the top ten nicest things
anybody has ever done for me.

54:12.548 --> 54:14.345
Don't worry about it.

54:22.325 --> 54:23.292
Hey,

54:23.927 --> 54:27.055
I know things are feeling
pretty bad for you right now,

54:27.163 --> 54:31.429
what with your biological dad not being
a real stuntman and whatnot, but,

54:32.468 --> 54:35.562
I dunno, the way I look at it,
you've still got this other dad at home,

54:35.672 --> 54:38.971
sick in bed,
and you sure do love him, man.

54:39.075 --> 54:41.441
And if he's sick, and you've got
the talent to make him better,

54:41.544 --> 54:43.842
well, that's pretty special.

54:43.947 --> 54:46.507
And to deny that would just be

54:47.317 --> 54:48.545
dumb.

54:49.652 --> 54:52.382
All right. Take it easy, mountain-face!

54:57.193 --> 54:59.161
- Hospital?
- Trash can!

55:01.264 --> 55:03.061
Sweet. Thanks, buddy.

55:15.712 --> 55:19.045
Teacher, there are things

55:19.148 --> 55:21.946
That I don't wanna learn

55:23.252 --> 55:25.846
'Cause there ain't no joy

55:26.656 --> 55:28.590
For an uptown...

55:35.665 --> 55:36.962
Hey.

55:37.734 --> 55:38.792
Hey.

55:39.335 --> 55:40.632
So, look,

55:42.005 --> 55:46.169
I was way out of line, and I'm sorry.

55:47.243 --> 55:48.608
It's okay.

55:49.746 --> 55:51.008
Sorry about your dad.

55:52.081 --> 55:53.275
Thanks.

55:54.717 --> 55:57.550
So, cool beans?

55:58.521 --> 55:59.886
Cool beans.

56:01.424 --> 56:02.550
Cool beans.

56:03.426 --> 56:04.723
Cool beans.

56:05.294 --> 56:06.386
Cool beans.

56:06.496 --> 56:07.895
- Cool beans.
- Cool beans.

56:07.997 --> 56:09.760
- Cool beans.
- Cool beans.

56:10.033 --> 56:11.591
- Cool, cool.
- Bean, beans.

56:11.701 --> 56:12.668
- Cool.
- Beans.

56:12.769 --> 56:14.396
- Cool, cool.
- Beans, beans.

56:14.504 --> 56:15.471
- Cool...
- Beans.

56:15.571 --> 56:17.163
- Cool, cool
- Beans, beans

56:17.273 --> 56:18.240
- Cool
- Beans

56:18.341 --> 56:21.003
- Cool
- Beans

56:21.110 --> 56:22.668
- Cool, cool
- Beans, beans

56:22.779 --> 56:23.803
- Cool
- Beans

56:23.913 --> 56:25.505
- Cool, cool
- Beans, beans

56:25.615 --> 56:26.604
- Cool
- Beans

56:26.716 --> 56:28.411
- Cool, cool
- Beans, beans

56:28.518 --> 56:29.485
- Cool
- Beans

56:29.585 --> 56:31.416
- Cool, cool, cool
- Beans

56:31.521 --> 56:32.749
Cool beans!

56:35.925 --> 56:38.120
So, cool beans?

56:38.561 --> 56:40.825
Yeah. Cool beans.

56:40.930 --> 56:43.694
Good.
Because I have some exciting news.

56:44.033 --> 56:45.022
So, before the screening,

56:45.168 --> 56:47.466
I took the liberty of posting
some of the stunt footage online.

56:47.570 --> 56:48.696
Great.

56:48.805 --> 56:50.170
Well, I guess people
liked what they saw,

56:50.273 --> 56:51.968
because it started to get sent around.

56:52.075 --> 56:53.565
As of this morning,
it's been downloaded

56:53.676 --> 56:56.042
over 100,000 times.

56:56.145 --> 56:57.271
Seriously?

56:57.380 --> 57:02.044
Yeah. It's bouncing around the web like
a beach ball at a Nickelback concert.

57:02.351 --> 57:04.342
But that's not even the best part.

57:04.454 --> 57:06.285
KNER called us.

57:06.389 --> 57:09.017
- The AM radio station?
- Yeah.

57:09.125 --> 57:11.685
They heard about the web stuff,
and how we're trying to save Frank

57:11.794 --> 57:13.227
and they wanna sponsor the bus jump,

57:13.329 --> 57:15.763
with all the proceeds going
to Frank's surgery.

57:15.865 --> 57:17.856
And what'd you tell them?

57:19.635 --> 57:21.933
I think you'll be needing this.

57:47.230 --> 57:48.891
Oh, hey, Mr. Pasternack.

57:49.465 --> 57:50.932
Hey, Kevin.

57:51.033 --> 57:54.833
Hi. Mr. Pasternack, I'd like
to introduce you to my brother, Rod.

57:54.937 --> 57:56.871
- Pleasure to meet you, son.
- Hi.

57:56.973 --> 57:59.567
Mr. Pasternack is the owner of
the radio station that's funding the jump.

57:59.675 --> 58:01.540
And I'm the number one DJ.

58:01.644 --> 58:03.077
No shit.

58:03.513 --> 58:06.971
I've gotta tell you, boys, I couldn't be
more excited about this jump.

58:07.083 --> 58:11.452
When people hear me describing it over
the radio, they are going to remember

58:11.554 --> 58:16.184
that AM radio is a viable and modern
source for news and entertainment.

58:16.292 --> 58:17.919
Totally.

58:18.027 --> 58:20.154
I used to be number one in this town,

58:20.263 --> 58:22.561
but people don't listen to AM
like they used to.

58:22.665 --> 58:25.498
Seems like it's more
about FM and color TV.

58:25.601 --> 58:27.762
- That's stupid.
- It sure is, Kevin.

58:27.870 --> 58:31.806
In fact, I've got a tattoo here
that fully illustrates my point.

58:31.908 --> 58:36.345
It's of this rebellious young man,
and he's urinating on an FM radio.

58:36.445 --> 58:40.074
And then this other stream of urine is
going onto that television set.

58:40.183 --> 58:41.673
Implausible, I know,

58:41.817 --> 58:44.115
but I like to imagine
that he had sex the night before,

58:44.220 --> 58:47.451
and now a little bit of residue
is blocking his urethra,

58:47.557 --> 58:50.219
allowing the urine to flow
in two separate directions.

58:50.326 --> 58:54.262
You may also note that an AM radio
is sitting, safely dry, in the middle.

58:54.363 --> 58:56.160
It's on a little magic carpet there.

58:56.265 --> 58:58.358
Oh, yeah, look at that.

58:58.467 --> 59:03.200
Now, Rod, I've spent
the station's last $15,000 on this.

59:03.306 --> 59:06.639
So it has to be a big success.
You understand?

59:06.742 --> 59:09.472
- You can count on me, sir.
- Excellent.

59:09.579 --> 59:13.675
This is the big one, boys.
This is the one that brings us back.

59:13.983 --> 59:18.113
Soon, AM radio will reign king
once more!

59:35.605 --> 59:37.766
Honey, your phone's ringing.

59:37.974 --> 59:39.464
What?

59:39.842 --> 59:41.707
Don't worry, I got it.

59:45.114 --> 59:46.081
Hello.

59:46.182 --> 59:48.343
Hi, may I speak to Denise, please?

59:48.451 --> 59:51.318
No, she's in the can.
Can I take a message?

59:51.420 --> 59:53.388
- Jonathan?
- Yup.

59:53.489 --> 59:55.320
Okay. You got a pen?

59:55.424 --> 59:57.289
Yes, sir. Got one right here.

59:57.393 --> 59:58.826
The message is,

59:58.928 --> 01:00:00.657
"Denise, it's Rod.

01:00:00.763 --> 01:00:05.632
"I'm jumping 15 buses tomorrow at
the fairgrounds. Hope you can make it."

01:00:05.735 --> 01:00:08.636
Fifteen buses.

01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:10.501
Wait, did you really write it down,

01:00:10.606 --> 01:00:12.801
or are you just waving your arm
around in the air?

01:00:12.908 --> 01:00:16.366
Come on.
Rod, you've got some imagination, kid.

01:00:16.479 --> 01:00:18.413
Don't worry about it.
I'm gonna get her the message.

01:00:18.514 --> 01:00:19.776
Okay.

01:00:21.217 --> 01:00:22.809
Who was that?

01:00:22.918 --> 01:00:24.408
Wrong number.

01:00:35.631 --> 01:00:37.155
I give the old man a week.

01:00:37.266 --> 01:00:39.234
Really insensitive, Bob.

01:00:45.207 --> 01:00:47.038
He's had a bad day.

01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:49.941
Maybe you should sit with him.

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:05.692
Hey, Frank.

01:01:06.128 --> 01:01:09.427
I know you're not feeling so good,
but I need you to hold on a little longer.

01:01:10.633 --> 01:01:12.601
The big jump's tomorrow.

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:14.860
We're gonna sell tickets

01:01:14.970 --> 01:01:17.530
and people are gonna hear about it
at home on the AM radio

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.335
and donate money.

01:01:19.709 --> 01:01:21.404
It's basically the perfect plan.

01:01:24.547 --> 01:01:26.913
You're gonna get yourself killed.

01:01:27.683 --> 01:01:31.175
Well, I'd rather die than live in a world
where I can't kick your ass.

01:01:35.658 --> 01:01:36.716
Rod.

01:01:39.729 --> 01:01:40.787
What?

01:01:40.896 --> 01:01:43.262
You know why I've been so hard on you?

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:47.826
Because when I'm gone, you're gonna
have to be the man around here.

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:53.968
Frank, if I do land this jump,
will you respect me?

01:02:02.118 --> 01:02:05.610
Not until you beat me in a fight,
you pathetic washout.

01:02:06.021 --> 01:02:08.285
I can't wait to punch your face in.

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:10.823
And I can't wait for you to try.

01:05:02.301 --> 01:05:05.134
What the hell? Was that because of us?

01:05:05.237 --> 01:05:08.968
I dunno, man. It started off
super positive, then it just got crazy.

01:05:09.074 --> 01:05:10.541
I did not like that at all.

01:05:10.642 --> 01:05:12.735
No, Kev. None of us did.

01:05:12.845 --> 01:05:15.279
Yeah, it was totally messed up.

01:05:15.814 --> 01:05:18.749
It's disgusting how people will just,
you know, take something good

01:05:18.851 --> 01:05:21.251
- and just take advantage of a situation.
- Yeah.

01:05:21.353 --> 01:05:23.685
There was no time to do anything,
except just leave

01:05:23.789 --> 01:05:26.314
and just hope that you're not hurt.

01:05:26.425 --> 01:05:27.687
It's great to have you guys back,
by the way.

01:05:27.793 --> 01:05:28.919
- Well, thank you, man.
- Feels good to be back.

01:05:29.027 --> 01:05:31.291
- So, you wanna...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:05:31.397 --> 01:05:35.595
The dog walked itself home,
ate a pizza, and took a nap.

01:05:35.934 --> 01:05:38.994
In local news,
self-proclaimed stuntman Rod Kimble

01:05:39.104 --> 01:05:42.505
is going to attempt to jump
fifteen buses today.

01:05:42.608 --> 01:05:44.633
We would bring you
coverage of the jump,

01:05:44.743 --> 01:05:49.840
but apparently an AM radio station
has the exclusive broadcasting rights.

01:05:49.948 --> 01:05:52.280
In other news, riots broke out...

01:05:52.384 --> 01:05:53.442
Terrific.

01:05:54.119 --> 01:05:55.916
Buckle your seatbelts
and open your ears,

01:05:56.021 --> 01:05:59.354
it's a jump for the ages today
on KNER AM.

01:05:59.458 --> 01:06:03.451
But first, here's Duke Wentworth
with A Jim-Jam Jubilee.

01:06:04.596 --> 01:06:07.121
- All right, there you go.
- Here, Rod.

01:06:07.232 --> 01:06:08.665
- Cool, what's your name?
- Matt.

01:06:08.767 --> 01:06:13.295
Matt. You are cool. Don't be like Frank.

01:06:13.806 --> 01:06:15.797
Rod. There you go.

01:06:15.908 --> 01:06:17.136
Thanks, Rod.

01:06:17.242 --> 01:06:20.006
All right, thanks, guys.
And don't let your dads eat pie.

01:06:20.112 --> 01:06:21.807
Hey, Kev.

01:06:22.314 --> 01:06:24.908
- Have you seen Denise anywhere?
- No, I haven't seen her all day.

01:06:30.289 --> 01:06:33.019
- What was that?
- We just hit a raccoon.

01:06:33.592 --> 01:06:35.423
Jonathan, don't you think
we should stop?

01:06:35.527 --> 01:06:38.189
Oh, trust me, babe. That raccoon
would not have stopped for us.

01:06:38.297 --> 01:06:39.457
Are you serious?

01:06:39.565 --> 01:06:42.898
Oh, my God. I can't wait to tell Sullivan.
He'll be so psyched.

01:06:46.338 --> 01:06:49.796
I'm gonna grab a Vitaminwater.
Should I make that dos?

01:06:50.108 --> 01:06:51.473
No, thanks.

01:06:51.577 --> 01:06:52.908
Coolio.

01:06:53.579 --> 01:06:55.342
Hey, maybe I'll get a box of dong bags

01:06:55.447 --> 01:06:57.312
so we can knock boots later,
what do you think?

01:07:00.352 --> 01:07:02.946
Truly a momentous day for listening

01:07:03.155 --> 01:07:06.784
as stuntman Rod Kimble
will jump 15 buses

01:07:06.892 --> 01:07:08.985
in a last-ditch effort
to save his stepfather.

01:07:09.094 --> 01:07:10.425
My oops, forgot my wallet.

01:07:10.529 --> 01:07:12.429
Jonathan, Rod's doing the jump.

01:07:12.531 --> 01:07:14.590
Oh, my God, who cares?

01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:16.725
Babe, why do you hang
with those nerds?

01:07:17.369 --> 01:07:18.802
I like those nerds.

01:07:18.904 --> 01:07:21.099
Well, guess what?
You're embarrassing yourself.

01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:25.198
It's only embarrassing if you care
what people think.

01:07:25.310 --> 01:07:26.971
That's a good one. I like that.

01:07:27.846 --> 01:07:30.246
- Babe?
- Goodbye.

01:07:30.516 --> 01:07:32.416
Babe, wait. Babe, wait.

01:07:32.518 --> 01:07:35.612
Babe, wait! Babe!

01:07:35.721 --> 01:07:38.383
Babe, wait! Babe. Babe. Babe.

01:07:38.490 --> 01:07:41.288
Babe! Babe, wait. Babe, no!

01:07:41.393 --> 01:07:43.293
Babe, no! Babe, no!

01:07:43.462 --> 01:07:47.831
Babe!

01:07:47.933 --> 01:07:51.630
Babe, babe, babe! No, babe!

01:07:51.970 --> 01:07:52.994
Wait!

01:08:03.048 --> 01:08:04.208
No way.

01:08:04.316 --> 01:08:05.783
You're gonna look
like a champion, Rod.

01:08:05.884 --> 01:08:08.182
You guys, this thing is number one.

01:08:08.287 --> 01:08:10.278
- Wait, Rod, there's more.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:10.389 --> 01:08:13.017
We were worried that the moped
might not be fast enough

01:08:13.125 --> 01:08:15.252
to clear the jump, so...

01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:19.761
No way.

01:08:22.667 --> 01:08:23.635
Whoa.

01:08:24.036 --> 01:08:26.162
Dave, this thing is number one!

01:08:26.270 --> 01:08:29.296
Now, I know she doesn't look like much,
but trust me, man.

01:08:29.408 --> 01:08:32.036
- She's got some kick. A lot.
- All right.

01:08:32.144 --> 01:08:33.337
There's one more thing, Rod.

01:08:33.444 --> 01:08:36.413
I know how you like explosions
and showmanship and stuff.

01:08:36.515 --> 01:08:38.676
So, I rigged the whole jump
with fireworks.

01:08:38.783 --> 01:08:39.944
Cool.

01:08:40.051 --> 01:08:42.885
And I got you this rock to represent
all my hard work.

01:08:42.988 --> 01:08:45.013
Oh, cool, Rico.

01:08:46.258 --> 01:08:47.589
That's number one.

01:08:47.693 --> 01:08:51.151
Yeah, you can pretty much just toss
that after the fireworks go off. It's cool.

01:08:51.263 --> 01:08:52.491
Thanks.

01:08:53.398 --> 01:08:54.421
Thanks, all of you.

01:09:33.505 --> 01:09:37.134
Okay, everyone. It's the moment
we've all been waiting for.

01:09:37.242 --> 01:09:41.008
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Rod Kimble!

01:10:06.138 --> 01:10:07.400
He's going in circles!

01:10:11.443 --> 01:10:12.432
Rod!

01:10:13.612 --> 01:10:14.943
Rod!

01:10:20.185 --> 01:10:21.152
Rod!

01:10:30.529 --> 01:10:34.260
Who wants to see me do
a big-ass stunt?

01:10:41.273 --> 01:10:43.468
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:10:43.809 --> 01:10:45.743
What is destiny?

01:10:46.344 --> 01:10:47.834
What is fate?

01:10:48.346 --> 01:10:52.484
I dedicate this jump to fathers
and father figures everywhere.

01:10:53.051 --> 01:10:59.615
I hope that in some small way
all of their sons manage to jump them.

01:10:59.725 --> 01:11:03.161
Frank, I'm gonna get you better,
you old sack of shit.

01:11:03.261 --> 01:11:08.824
And then I am gonna uncork the
ass-beating of a lifetime on you!

01:11:08.934 --> 01:11:11.459
And you will respect me!

01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:12.730
Peace!

01:11:25.050 --> 01:11:28.110
Kimble clearly has a few issues
with his stepfather there.

01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:30.450
But who doesn't? I know I do.

01:11:35.293 --> 01:11:36.555
You got this, man!

01:11:36.661 --> 01:11:40.153
Just remember.
Drive really, really, really fast, okay?

01:11:40.265 --> 01:11:42.426
And hold on tight! You'll be fine!

01:11:42.534 --> 01:11:44.798
I'm so nervous for you!

01:11:44.903 --> 01:11:47.895
And everybody here is!
We're nervous for you!

01:11:48.006 --> 01:11:49.132
I was just in the bathroom,

01:11:49.241 --> 01:11:52.802
and everybody's talking about
how crazy this is.

01:11:52.911 --> 01:11:54.105
- Okay.
- Don't worry about it.

01:11:54.212 --> 01:11:56.806
You're gonna do great!
Now go kick those buses' ass!

01:11:59.284 --> 01:12:01.775
You good?

01:12:03.321 --> 01:12:06.757
Do you like stunts?
What about terminally ill stepfathers?

01:12:07.192 --> 01:12:09.353
Well, if you answered yes to one
or both of those questions,

01:12:09.461 --> 01:12:13.454
you couldn't have picked a better day
to stumble upon KNER radio.

01:12:36.121 --> 01:12:37.554
Hey, Rod!

01:12:37.656 --> 01:12:39.248
Denise. You came.

01:12:39.357 --> 01:12:41.757
Of course.

01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:42.986
Oh, wow.

01:12:43.094 --> 01:12:44.391
Yeah.

01:12:45.931 --> 01:12:48.832
- Denise, I don't know what I'm doing.
- What?

01:12:48.934 --> 01:12:52.028
I mean, this jump is huge. I could die.

01:12:53.338 --> 01:12:55.363
You're the bravest guy I know, Rod.

01:12:57.342 --> 01:12:58.832
I don't know what to believe anymore.

01:12:59.711 --> 01:13:01.770
Believe in this.

01:13:10.956 --> 01:13:12.218
Oh, wait.

01:13:12.324 --> 01:13:13.951
What? You don't...

01:13:14.059 --> 01:13:17.358
No, I do. I do. I just...

01:13:17.462 --> 01:13:20.761
- Your mouth was all open.
- Oh, God.

01:13:20.866 --> 01:13:23.198
It was just like...

01:13:23.501 --> 01:13:24.627
Anyways.

01:13:29.441 --> 01:13:33.172
Oh, whoa, wait, what?
Why is Rod kissing his sister, man?

01:13:33.278 --> 01:13:35.678
Denise isn't his sister.

01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:38.248
- She's not?
- No.

01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:40.511
Man, that shatters my entire universe.

01:13:40.619 --> 01:13:42.849
I'm not saying
that kiss was hot, listeners,

01:13:42.954 --> 01:13:47.084
but if the boner police are here,
I demand a lawyer!

01:13:47.192 --> 01:13:50.025
- Good luck, Rod.
- Thanks.

01:13:53.999 --> 01:13:57.230
All right, swing man. Back in business.

01:13:57.335 --> 01:13:59.462
Hey, how are you?

01:14:03.541 --> 01:14:06.806
Kimble's preparing
for his final approach.

01:14:06.912 --> 01:14:11.440
Ascending the multiple ramp levels
to the tippy-top.

01:14:41.947 --> 01:14:44.438
Why'd the numbers stop?

01:14:44.549 --> 01:14:46.983
I guess people wanna see
what happens.

01:14:49.988 --> 01:14:52.923
Souls of the animal kingdom.

01:14:53.024 --> 01:14:59.520
Eagle, fox, bottlenose dolphin,
octopus, house cat.

01:15:01.166 --> 01:15:03.430
Okay.

01:15:03.535 --> 01:15:05.196
Let's jump this jump.

01:15:11.843 --> 01:15:13.640
Come on, Rod!

01:15:18.249 --> 01:15:19.443
Here he goes.

01:15:20.919 --> 01:15:24.582
He's driving the bikey-thing
with his hands and legs.

01:15:24.689 --> 01:15:26.919
This needs to be seen to be believed!

01:15:27.926 --> 01:15:31.384
Three, two, one, liftoff!

01:16:04.262 --> 01:16:06.696
Oh, he's like a broken doll.

01:16:13.671 --> 01:16:15.138
Oh, this does not look good.

01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:17.265
Rod's crew is running to his side.

01:16:17.375 --> 01:16:19.900
I, for one, hope none of them had a fight
with Rod this morning,

01:16:20.011 --> 01:16:22.206
because he is more than likely dead.

01:16:22.347 --> 01:16:23.974
- Rod.
- Oh, no.

01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:27.784
- Rod, are you okay? Can you hear me?
- Step aside, please.

01:16:27.886 --> 01:16:30.377
Rod, stay away from the light, man.
Don't go towards that light.

01:16:31.823 --> 01:16:33.848
Rod?

01:16:38.563 --> 01:16:39.552
Oh, God, he's probably having

01:16:39.664 --> 01:16:42.497
some sort of profound,
out-of-body experience.

01:16:56.381 --> 01:16:57.507
Hi.

01:17:04.189 --> 01:17:06.419
Oh, yes. Yes.

01:17:10.228 --> 01:17:11.286
Yes.

01:17:12.464 --> 01:17:14.523
- I'm not getting any vitals.
- Oh, Rod.

01:17:17.435 --> 01:17:18.493
Rod?

01:17:18.603 --> 01:17:20.195
Finish him! Finish him!

01:17:20.305 --> 01:17:21.966
Yes, taco!

01:17:23.641 --> 01:17:25.734
Rod? Rod?

01:17:25.844 --> 01:17:27.141
Denise?

01:17:27.245 --> 01:17:28.712
Hoobastank.

01:17:28.813 --> 01:17:30.610
He's alive.

01:17:32.117 --> 01:17:34.915
Denise. You were right.

01:17:35.019 --> 01:17:36.008
The taco won.

01:17:37.288 --> 01:17:39.813
Okay, Rod. Okay.

01:17:39.924 --> 01:17:40.948
Time to get up.

01:17:41.059 --> 01:17:43.892
- No, no, Rod, don't move. Don't move.
- You could have internal injuries.

01:17:43.995 --> 01:17:46.862
Sorry, guys. I'm walking out of here.

01:17:46.965 --> 01:17:50.457
No, no, no. No, no, no, Rod.

01:17:50.568 --> 01:17:51.592
Wait a minute.

01:17:51.703 --> 01:17:55.867
It appears Kimble is awake,
and he's trying to stand up.

01:17:55.974 --> 01:17:58.374
Seriously, you're probably
hurt pretty bad.

01:17:58.476 --> 01:18:00.103
I'd say definitely, Kevin.

01:18:00.211 --> 01:18:03.305
I'd wager 10 to 20 broken bones,
minimum.

01:18:04.916 --> 01:18:06.406
But life is pain

01:18:06.518 --> 01:18:10.318
and we've got to scrape the joy out of it
every chance we get.

01:18:10.421 --> 01:18:12.855
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

01:18:13.758 --> 01:18:15.123
Rod.

01:18:15.393 --> 01:18:18.419
Rod! Rod! Rod!

01:18:18.530 --> 01:18:22.364
The crowd is cheering Kimble
back to life.

01:18:23.201 --> 01:18:26.227
Rod! Rod! Rod!

01:18:28.873 --> 01:18:33.276
Rod! Rod! Rod!

01:18:42.487 --> 01:18:44.978
And the phones are ringing off the hook!

01:18:55.433 --> 01:18:59.369
Rod. Rod, look. Look.

01:19:12.050 --> 01:19:13.881
We did it!

01:19:17.922 --> 01:19:19.014
They've done it!

01:19:19.123 --> 01:19:24.425
They've raised $50,000
for Frank's conveniently-priced surgery.

01:19:30.535 --> 01:19:32.435
Rod, Rod! Over here!

01:19:32.537 --> 01:19:34.129
We did it, Richardson!

01:19:34.839 --> 01:19:36.807
Rod knows my name.
Rod knows my name.

01:19:36.908 --> 01:19:37.966
Rod knows my name!

01:19:38.076 --> 01:19:40.909
People are screaming
and jumping up and down.

01:19:41.012 --> 01:19:43.207
The fairgrounds are literally shaking!

01:19:44.816 --> 01:19:47.751
A cooked goose for everyone!

01:19:47.852 --> 01:19:49.786
It's Ebenezer Scrooge!

01:19:49.887 --> 01:19:52.685
Yes, a cooked goose.

01:19:53.958 --> 01:19:55.823
Dave.

01:20:29.794 --> 01:20:33.252
- Rod, do you really need to do this?
- Yes.

01:20:33.364 --> 01:20:35.855
Come on, Rod. The doctor said
his heart's even stronger than before.

01:20:35.967 --> 01:20:37.229
You're not gonna win.

01:20:37.335 --> 01:20:39.496
Kevin, it's not up for discussion.

01:20:41.806 --> 01:20:45.264
Gods of war!

01:20:45.376 --> 01:20:47.844
May your hammer be mighty

01:20:50.848 --> 01:20:52.110
Here I am, Frank.

01:20:53.785 --> 01:20:57.346
Get ready to meet your maker. Oh, God!

01:20:57.455 --> 01:20:59.184
We hadn't even started yet!

01:20:59.290 --> 01:21:01.383
Never underestimate your opponent.

01:21:07.365 --> 01:21:11.165
What's up now, Frank?
I'm doing this because I love you!

01:21:17.375 --> 01:21:20.811
- Never underestimate your opponent.
- Well, well, well.

01:21:20.912 --> 01:21:26.077
Finally, a fight I might actually...

01:21:27.251 --> 01:21:29.811
- Got you.
- What the hell? Is that a throwing star?

01:21:55.780 --> 01:21:58.214
Oh, hell, yeah, Roddy! Kick his ass!

01:21:58.316 --> 01:22:00.614
Come on, old man! Come on!

01:22:00.718 --> 01:22:03.551
Old man, young heart!

01:22:05.456 --> 01:22:06.650
Good Lord!

01:22:08.393 --> 01:22:11.726
Oh, shit. No mercy.

01:22:12.597 --> 01:22:14.360
Guys, come on, come on. That's rented.

01:22:16.934 --> 01:22:18.367
Jesus Christ.

01:22:19.937 --> 01:22:21.700
He just rocked him with a brick!

01:22:22.573 --> 01:22:23.699
Oh!

01:22:25.209 --> 01:22:26.335
Here we go.

01:22:28.179 --> 01:22:30.477
- Should we stop them?
- Oh, no, they're fine.

01:22:36.721 --> 01:22:39.281
- Oh, no.
- Say it, Frank!

01:22:39.390 --> 01:22:41.722
- Say I'm a man.
- Never.

01:22:45.329 --> 01:22:48.162
- Say it!
- You're a man.

01:22:48.266 --> 01:22:49.563
Say it again!

01:22:50.802 --> 01:22:53.430
You're a man, son.

01:22:58.042 --> 01:23:00.211
You've gotta be kidding me.

01:23:00.411 --> 01:23:01.844
Yeah!
