# I'm not sick but I'm not well

00:05.543 --> 00:08.586
# And I'm so hot

00:08.587 --> 00:12.592

00:17.880 --> 00:21.884
Sex over.
Now the smiling and staring.

00:22.166 --> 00:26.050
I think Dobby might be bored with me, sexually.
I'm vanilla. I should be...

00:26.051 --> 00:28.173
not neapolitan, that's too '70s,

00:28.174 --> 00:30.696
but pistachio - slightly
unpleasant, but novel.

00:30.697 --> 00:34.421
I was thinking of booking that country
house hotel for your birthday.

00:34.422 --> 00:37.586
Really?
Cos, country house hotels...?

00:37.587 --> 00:41.311
I mean, doesn't working in a Mexican
restaurant mean we'd be better suited

00:41.312 --> 00:43.954
to a Premier Inn and a
bottle of supermarket voddy?

00:43.955 --> 00:44.996
Or I could pay.

00:44.997 --> 00:48.240
No way. I'm being the man here
and paying for everything.

00:48.241 --> 00:51.525
I'm taking you away.
I might even carry you over the threshold.

00:51.526 --> 00:53.207
OK, Captain Caveman!

00:53.208 --> 00:56.291
Would you be able to drive us?
It's in Hereford.

00:56.292 --> 00:57.613
Sure.

00:57.614 --> 00:58.134
DOORBELL

00:58.135 --> 01:00.937
DOORBELL Shall I get it?
I've got your fluffy dressing gown on.

01:00.938 --> 01:03.140
Thanks. 'Officially,
it's a towelling robe.'

01:03.141 --> 01:06.705
Might not be incredibly stylish
but it is hugely absorbent.

01:06.706 --> 01:09.589
Oh, did I tell you?
Poor old Simon's mum's ill.

01:09.590 --> 01:11.071
How horrible for him.

01:11.072 --> 01:11.592
I might get a card.

01:11.593 --> 01:14.676
I might get a card. 'The cool, good-looking
ex-boyfriend whom I strongly suspect

01:14.677 --> 01:18.161
'was far better in bed than me.
His grief is mine.'

01:18.162 --> 01:19.563
You got some money, Mark?

01:19.564 --> 01:21.565
Hang on.
'Must be the Barnardo's man.'

01:21.566 --> 01:23.889
He's unemployed, Mark.

01:23.890 --> 01:27.734
Right. 'Is he, though? I'm pretty sure
I saw this exposed on Rogue Traders.'

01:27.735 --> 01:30.017
Just trying to make a bit
of honest money, really.

01:30.018 --> 01:31.779
Your neighbours have been very kind.

01:31.780 --> 01:33.381
So, uh, what have you got?

01:33.382 --> 01:35.504
Um, fluffy dusters, J-Cloths...

01:35.505 --> 01:39.109
'Shit. OK, don't choose the cheapest
in front of Dobby. So not J-Cloths.

01:39.110 --> 01:42.954
'Not scourers. Fluffy dusters?
I think they're relatively cheap.'

01:42.955 --> 01:43.996
..or oven gloves...

01:43.997 --> 01:44.877
Fluffy duster?

01:44.878 --> 01:46.599
Fluffy duster?
Sure mate. They're 11.

01:46.600 --> 01:47.761
They're what?

01:47.762 --> 01:51.165
11 quid. They're made of fibres.

01:51.166 --> 01:52.848
'I'm being politely mugged.'

01:52.849 --> 01:53.889
Thanks.

01:53.890 --> 01:56.373
I'll go and make some
coffee, Mr Generous.

01:56.374 --> 01:58.936
(WHISPERS) I'd have just
gone for the J-Cloths.

01:58.937 --> 02:03.582
'Great, just wasted 11 on 4
worth of female approval.'

02:03.583 --> 02:05.465
Right, I'm having that back.
You've conned me.

02:05.466 --> 02:07.468
I'm not some frail old
lady in sheltered housing.

02:07.469 --> 02:09.751
Get to fuck.

02:09.752 --> 02:11.553
Are you OK?

02:11.554 --> 02:15.559
It's fine. Things got a bit out
of hand, but I took control.

02:16.601 --> 02:18.603
So what did you think, Jeremy?

02:18.604 --> 02:21.727
Wow. That's what I thought.
Wowzers trousers.

02:21.728 --> 02:25.132
You didn't fall asleep, did you?
At one point I thought...

02:25.133 --> 02:27.495
No way!
No, I loved every minute of it.

02:27.496 --> 02:31.020
The colours, the woman, the...

02:31.021 --> 02:33.903
It was all great.
Amelie is a fantastic film.

02:33.904 --> 02:35.666
What a fantastic film.

02:35.667 --> 02:38.710
Yeah. It's French, but you can
easily work out what's happening

02:38.711 --> 02:40.112
most of the way through.

02:40.113 --> 02:41.313
Exactly.

02:41.314 --> 02:43.717
Not predigested, Hollywood
blockbuster crap.

02:43.718 --> 02:47.722
That shit, trying to lure you in by
entertaining you. It's so shallow.

02:48.324 --> 02:49.565
You cabbing it?

02:49.566 --> 02:50.286
I'm cabbing it.

02:50.287 --> 02:52.208
I'm cabbing it.
'Won't tell her I'm bussing it.'

02:52.209 --> 02:54.892
It's great, isn't it, how even
though I'm an attractive guy

02:54.893 --> 02:58.056
and you're an attractive girl, we
can just hang out like great mates?

02:58.057 --> 02:59.578
Yeah, just cos I'm
going out with Ben...

02:59.579 --> 03:00.139
'The shit.'

03:00.140 --> 03:02.342
'The shit.' ..
doesn't mean you and I can't be buds.

03:02.343 --> 03:05.226
I mean, we have so many interests
in common - foreign film,

03:05.227 --> 03:07.829
fringe theatre, contemporary dance,

03:07.830 --> 03:11.835
even those silver people in Covent
Garden who stand really still

03:11.876 --> 03:13.597
and pretend to be statues.

03:13.598 --> 03:16.561
I adore, enormously, all of that.

03:16.562 --> 03:18.644
And you run that book
group, don't you?

03:18.645 --> 03:20.847
Which is great, because I
love difficult literature.

03:20.848 --> 03:24.692
Wow! Another tick! I'd invite you
but we're full up at the minute.

03:24.693 --> 03:27.696
Does Ben... 'The shit.' ...go?

03:27.697 --> 03:28.578
No. He hates reading.

03:28.579 --> 03:30.821
No. He hates reading.
Oh, he is missing out on so much.

03:30.822 --> 03:31.461
Uh-huh.

03:31.462 --> 03:33.384
Uh-huh. So many people
just plod through life,

03:33.385 --> 03:35.667
you know, thinking the
same stupid thoughts

03:35.668 --> 03:39.432
with their tiny, predictable,
Identikit minds.

03:39.433 --> 03:42.276
Most people just go around nodding to the
last opinion they heard, don't they?

03:42.277 --> 03:43.318
I agree.

03:43.319 --> 03:45.641
Excuse me, Melvyn.
Is one of you getting in?

03:45.642 --> 03:47.203
Bye, then.

03:47.204 --> 03:51.208
Bye. Thanks for a lovely
afternoon of French cinema.

03:51.410 --> 03:52.770
Au revoir, mon ami!

03:52.771 --> 03:56.415
Indeedy. 'This is all so
fucking sophisticated.'

03:56.416 --> 03:59.019
See you tomorrow. A demain.

03:59.020 --> 04:00.301
No, you da man!

04:00.302 --> 04:01.743
(LAUGHS)

04:01.744 --> 04:05.468
'Why is that funny?'

04:05.469 --> 04:07.550
And you're off it all? Crack as well?

04:07.551 --> 04:10.434
But you love crack,
it's your favourite.

04:10.435 --> 04:14.039
Especially crack, Jez.
I've stopped putting all that poison and shit

04:14.040 --> 04:16.122
into my body and my precious brain.

04:16.123 --> 04:16.882
Since when?

04:16.884 --> 04:18.524
Since when?
Since Tuesday.

04:18.526 --> 04:22.250
I had a sort of road-to-Damascus
flash on the A22.

04:22.251 --> 04:25.455
Crashed the van into some guy's
hedge cos I was so fucking wrecked.

04:25.456 --> 04:27.057
And then this voice in my head -

04:27.058 --> 04:31.062
sounded like Brian Moore, who
used to do the football on ITV -

04:31.464 --> 04:33.666
said, "Pack it in, son. Mug's game."

04:33.667 --> 04:37.151
Well, that's very sensible,
albeit hallucinatory, advice.

04:37.152 --> 04:39.273
Mark, um...

04:39.274 --> 04:42.358
Look, in here...

04:42.359 --> 04:46.363
is my pipe and my last rock.
I want you to have it.

04:46.444 --> 04:47.845
I don't want it. It's illegal.

04:47.846 --> 04:50.128
I want you to keep it, please.
It's symbolic.

04:50.129 --> 04:54.134
And if I come to you and ask you for
it, I want you to tell me "no", OK?

04:54.816 --> 04:56.937
OK.

04:56.938 --> 04:59.541
Even if I hit you,

04:59.542 --> 05:03.386
hard, with wood, or grab your arm
and bend it up behind your back

05:03.387 --> 05:06.230
till it snaps like a fucking KitKat,
you still tell me no, right?

05:06.231 --> 05:07.311
With wood?

05:07.312 --> 05:09.434
Thanks, Mark. Legend.

05:09.435 --> 05:10.716
So how's all this going?

05:10.717 --> 05:14.041
Easy, man.
Easy like a Sonntag Morgen.

05:14.042 --> 05:15.723
I'm just finding other
things to fill my time.

05:15.724 --> 05:16.284
Like what?

05:16.285 --> 05:18.447
Like what?
Cycling, running.

05:18.448 --> 05:20.129
I ran 10k yesterday.

05:20.130 --> 05:23.213
I ran here this morning, then back
home, and then back here again.

05:23.214 --> 05:26.618
I'm cooking, knitting...
Knitting like a fucking electric nan.

05:26.619 --> 05:29.181
Did this scarf.
I've got two quilts on the go

05:29.182 --> 05:32.185
and a sort of tabard.
It's cool. It's easy.

05:32.186 --> 05:32.746
Great.

05:32.747 --> 05:34.188
Great.
You got any olives?

05:34.189 --> 05:35.630
I've gone fucking mental for olives.

05:35.631 --> 05:36.912
No, we...

05:36.913 --> 05:39.275
Shit! Jesus!
Where am I going to get olives?!

05:39.276 --> 05:41.278
I'm craving the salt.

05:41.279 --> 05:42.359
We've got salt.

05:42.360 --> 05:46.364
I'm not going to go necking fucking
salt straight from the shaker, Mark.

05:47.126 --> 05:51.131
I'm not mad. Right, fucking laters.
I'm going to sprint to Londis.

05:55.778 --> 05:56.298
DOOR CLOSES

05:56.299 --> 05:57.620
DOOR CLOSES He is a bit mad, isn't he?

05:57.621 --> 05:59.462
Jez, I'm...

05:59.463 --> 06:03.468
I'm slightly worried that Dobby
might still be in love with Simon.

06:04.190 --> 06:04.709
Yeah.

06:04.710 --> 06:06.552
Yeah. D'you mean, yeah,
you think she is?

06:06.553 --> 06:08.835
No, no, I mean, yeah, I'm not
really listening. Sorry.

06:08.836 --> 06:12.840
And I'm worried that I might not be...

06:13.322 --> 06:14.162
What?

06:14.163 --> 06:18.168
What? Look, you know the actual...
The act of intercourse...

06:19.010 --> 06:21.612
Oh, my God!
You're asking me for sex tips!

06:21.613 --> 06:25.618
Pass me the cava and the big pack of
Tyrrels - it's a girls' night in!

06:25.819 --> 06:29.823
What would you say was the average
amount of time before the man...?

06:30.305 --> 06:31.185
Unleashes hell?

06:31.186 --> 06:33.468
Unleashes hell? Yes.
I want the average amount of time,

06:33.469 --> 06:36.512
the mean...
No, the mode or median.

06:36.513 --> 06:38.796
Sting's probably thrown the
mean out for everyone else.

06:38.797 --> 06:40.638
Well, it depends, Mark.

06:40.639 --> 06:44.643
It often depends on, you know,
where you are,if you get me.

06:45.325 --> 06:48.409
No, no, I don't want to
hear about the bum, Jeremy.

06:48.410 --> 06:50.612
I know for you it all
revolves around the bum.

06:50.613 --> 06:52.294
You're like the
Copernicus of the anus.

06:52.295 --> 06:53.816
You've got to know
about the bum, Mark.

06:53.817 --> 06:57.381
Otherwise, it's like only cooking with
the hob and never using the oven.

06:57.382 --> 06:59.624
The bum is the secret portal.

06:59.625 --> 07:02.548
It's not much of a secret, though,
is it, Jeremy? Be honest.

07:02.549 --> 07:06.513
The bum is quite - if you'll
pardon the image - an open secret.

07:06.514 --> 07:09.077
So you think you've
lost your dirty mojo?

07:09.078 --> 07:11.560
Yeah, I am a bit
desperate on that front.

07:11.561 --> 07:13.563
I mean, I've even bought a...

07:13.564 --> 07:14.284
What?

07:14.285 --> 07:16.687
What?
Nothing.

07:16.688 --> 07:20.692
A what, Mark?

07:20.733 --> 07:22.375
Blimey.

07:22.376 --> 07:25.339
It's a dildo.
I've bought a big dildo.

07:25.340 --> 07:27.261
How big is it?

07:27.262 --> 07:29.745
Nine inches. It's a nine-incher.

07:29.746 --> 07:31.347
I thought it might spice things up.

07:31.348 --> 07:35.352
Trouble is, I find it quite
intimidating, as a man.

07:35.393 --> 07:37.435
I mean, look at it, it's
like a leg of lamb.

07:37.436 --> 07:41.200
So I've decided to call it
Kenneth, to take the curse off.

07:41.201 --> 07:41.881
Kenneth?

07:41.882 --> 07:43.964
Kenneth? Yes.
"My colleague, Kenneth."

07:43.965 --> 07:45.806
"Shall I fetch Kenneth?"

07:45.807 --> 07:47.809
"Meet my sexual associate, Kenneth."

07:47.810 --> 07:49.932
Makes him less daunting.

07:49.933 --> 07:53.016
And has Kenneth seen action?

07:53.017 --> 07:55.860
No. I mean, it might be
the sexiest thing ever,

07:55.861 --> 07:57.662
or it might be a massive disaster.

07:57.663 --> 08:01.668
Dobby might hate it. So, for now,
you stay at Brize Norton, Kenneth.

08:02.750 --> 08:06.755
I don't think you're ready
to enter Helmand yet.

08:08.198 --> 08:10.560
So is your work still... 'Good? Bad?

08:10.561 --> 08:12.402
'Does he like it there now?
I've forgotten.' ..you know?

08:12.403 --> 08:15.046
I despise every second of it.
We're short-staffed

08:15.047 --> 08:17.289
and Gail keeps making me
do these extra shifts,

08:17.290 --> 08:19.412
and she hates me since
you tried to kill her.

08:19.413 --> 08:21.775
Yeah. Sorry, man. My bad.

08:21.776 --> 08:24.419
You should tell her you need time off.
I'm no NHS Direct,

08:24.420 --> 08:27.223
but this stress can't be doing
your sex life any good.

08:27.224 --> 08:28.905
Tell Gail she's exploiting you.

08:28.906 --> 08:30.547
But then she'll fire me!

08:30.548 --> 08:33.030
I don't want to be unemployed.
I've got a girlfriend to impress.

08:33.030 --> 08:36.235
And when Sophie gets back from Wales,
I've also got a baby to impress.

08:36.236 --> 08:38.157
Christ, Mark, you really
need to grow a pair.

08:38.158 --> 08:39.399
Of testicles?

08:39.400 --> 08:40.039
Yes.

08:40.041 --> 08:41.761
Yes. You want me to grow
a pair of testicles

08:41.763 --> 08:43.004
so I'd have four testicles,

08:43.005 --> 08:46.969
and somehow that'll help make me braver
and better able to deal with stress?

08:46.970 --> 08:49.853
Staggering around like a baboon
with four balls hanging down.

08:49.854 --> 08:51.375
Look, Gail's fucking you over

08:51.376 --> 08:53.939
because you're so bloody passive.
You need to rip her a new one.

08:53.940 --> 08:56.823
A new anus?
So she'd have two anuses?

08:56.824 --> 08:58.585
And then in this mad
new world of yours,

08:58.586 --> 09:01.068
I'd presumably shove my four bollocks

09:01.069 --> 09:05.074
up her two anuses for
some unknown reason.

09:05.475 --> 09:08.519
'Never fancied a girl with glasses before.
I wouldn't care if she had a limp

09:08.520 --> 09:11.963
'or a funny elbow. I'm so PC.
I'm horny Gandhi.'

09:11.964 --> 09:14.767
Did you have a nice time at
whatever-the-fuck film it was with Zahra?

09:14.768 --> 09:16.409
Yeah, nice movie.

09:16.410 --> 09:18.492
The colours, the woman in it...

09:18.493 --> 09:20.134
It's a great arrangement
we've got here, Jez.

09:20.135 --> 09:21.176
Arrangement?

09:21.177 --> 09:24.020
Yeah. You take care of the
brainy, arty crap she likes,

09:24.021 --> 09:27.304
I take care of the physical side.
Like when she came back from Emily.

09:27.305 --> 09:28.666
Amelie. 'You shit.'

09:28.667 --> 09:30.669
She was in this really good mood,

09:30.670 --> 09:33.312
all sparked up and receptive.

09:33.313 --> 09:36.036
You can imagine what we got up to!

09:36.037 --> 09:38.760
Yeah. Shall I order that toner
from the Viking catalogue, or...?

09:38.761 --> 09:41.443
I won't go into detail about
what it is we did, Jez,

09:41.444 --> 09:44.167
but let's just say it wasn't
a long game of Scrabble!

09:44.168 --> 09:45.969
(CHUCKLES)

09:45.970 --> 09:49.855
Your glans isn't red raw after a
long game of Scrabble, is it?!

09:49.856 --> 09:51.897
Not ordinarily, no.

09:51.898 --> 09:52.939
You don't fancy Zahra, do you, Jez?

09:52.940 --> 09:54.060
You don't fancy Zahra,
do you, Jez? No.

09:54.061 --> 09:57.345
Because that would be an extremely
huge problem if you did.

09:57.346 --> 09:59.748
I really don't.
She's just normal, you know,

09:59.749 --> 10:03.753
like trifle or, uh, the pavement.
Just there.

10:03.955 --> 10:07.959
Anyway, I was wondering if you
wanted to dabble in a bit more A&R,

10:08.841 --> 10:11.604
check out some artists, a few
extra quid in your pay packet?

10:11.605 --> 10:14.808
Brilliant. 'Stop making my
lovely job lovelier, you shit!'

10:14.809 --> 10:16.691
Did Ben just give you a pay rise?

10:16.692 --> 10:20.696
Yeah. You know, I honestly never
thought I could enjoy working,

10:21.098 --> 10:23.500
because, obviously, when you work,

10:23.501 --> 10:26.825
you can't go back to bed until
night-time, which seems mad,

10:26.826 --> 10:28.547
but I really like it.

10:28.548 --> 10:30.149
I'm going to the Tate Modern

10:30.150 --> 10:33.273
for the Richard Avedon symposium on Friday.
I don't suppose you fancy coming?

10:33.274 --> 10:34.916
Yeah, sure.

10:34.917 --> 10:38.921
I mean, I was going myself anyway on
Sunday, but yeah, let's go together.

10:39.323 --> 10:42.686
'Jesus Christ, I am so out of my depth!
Who's Richard Avedon?

10:42.687 --> 10:44.248
'What's a symposium?

10:44.249 --> 10:48.214
'At least I know which day Friday is,
that's something to cling onto.'

10:48.215 --> 10:51.218
'Tension headache.
Brain tumour, maybe?

10:51.219 --> 10:53.541
'Sexy, fascinating,
roguish brain tumour?

10:53.542 --> 10:57.546
'Not with my luck. Think I will ask
Gail if I can take some time off.'

10:57.668 --> 10:59.629
Mark, what are you doing?
You're needed.

10:59.630 --> 11:02.153
Order for that table
of teenage pisstards?

11:02.154 --> 11:04.996
Right. Gail, when you've
got a second, later maybe,

11:04.997 --> 11:08.321
I was wondering whether my
taking some holiday might...

11:08.322 --> 11:10.604
Mark, we're two chefs down.
Abigail's got norovirus.

11:10.605 --> 11:13.328
Marek just took the tip of his
little finger off right on the eve

11:13.329 --> 11:15.371
of his sister's wedding.
Co-incidence?

11:15.372 --> 11:16.011
Um...

11:16.012 --> 11:18.895
Um... So this is not the time
for you to ask to skive off.

11:18.896 --> 11:20.417
Jesus!

11:20.418 --> 11:22.741
'Good to get that out in the open.
At least I know where I stand now.

11:22.742 --> 11:26.746
'I'm precisely where I was a second
ago but quite a bit more upset.

11:27.348 --> 11:31.432
'Shit. It's the Rogue Trader.
I wonder if his dish, perchance, cost 11.'

11:31.433 --> 11:34.276
Enjoy your meals.
'Just keep walking, Mark.'

11:34.277 --> 11:34.797
Oi.

11:34.798 --> 11:36.239
Oi. 'And now walk back, Mark.'

11:36.240 --> 11:37.521
I never ordered this.

11:37.522 --> 11:40.925
I think you did. Burritos Deluxe.

11:40.926 --> 11:44.250
No, Burritos Mexicano, with jalapeno sauce.
Do I know you?

11:44.251 --> 11:46.693
No. Um, oh, right, yes,

11:46.694 --> 11:49.857
I'm afraid my colleague who took your
order must have made a mistake, so...

11:49.858 --> 11:53.062
Don't blame her. For fuck's sake, man up.
You're the one who brought the wrong food.

11:53.063 --> 11:56.747
True, but I was only following orders.
'Like Vince Cable.'

11:56.748 --> 11:58.789
Don't blame a woman, you
piece of fucking dirt.

11:58.790 --> 12:01.794
Now fuck off back to that kitchen and
get me what you should have done

12:01.795 --> 12:02.875
the first time. Mug.

12:02.876 --> 12:04.878
'Fine. Right, fine.

12:04.879 --> 12:08.603
'OK, great, you want the
jalapeno sauce, mate?

12:08.604 --> 12:10.525
'Well, you can have
the jalapeno sauce,

12:10.526 --> 12:14.250
'but with my hot yellow piss in it.

12:14.251 --> 12:18.056
'Yeah, see how you like this!'

12:18.057 --> 12:20.299
'I can't go! I can't piss!

12:20.300 --> 12:22.902
'Come on, bladder!
Please let me piss in the sauce!'

12:22.903 --> 12:26.507
Mark...

12:26.508 --> 12:30.512
Am I sacked? Sh-Sh-Should I go?

12:30.554 --> 12:33.997
I bet I'm sacked.

12:33.998 --> 12:35.679
Dobby will definitely dump me now.

12:35.680 --> 12:37.442
Dobby will definitely dump me now.
No, she won't.

12:37.443 --> 12:41.447
She's got a special look of pity for
unemployed people. Like this...

12:41.849 --> 12:44.932
I'd say that was more
sympathy, or empathy.

12:44.933 --> 12:46.694
One of the pathies.
The pathies are nice.

12:46.695 --> 12:49.899
Anyway, we won't be able to
go away for her birthday now.

12:49.900 --> 12:53.464
We'll be stuck here with own-brand
couscous and Wallander.

12:53.465 --> 12:56.267
Don't worry. Zahra says we
have only one thing to fear,

12:56.268 --> 12:58.951
and that's fear itself.
It's a clever saying, isn't it?

12:58.952 --> 13:01.555
And what about losing all your money?

13:01.556 --> 13:03.397
Or shitting yourself in public?

13:03.398 --> 13:06.922
Or the tabloid press mistakenly
outing you as a paedo?

13:06.923 --> 13:09.726
Or Alzheimer's? Or all of those
things, plus you're drowning?

13:09.727 --> 13:12.169
It's a clever saying,
though, isn't it?

13:12.170 --> 13:15.253
Oh, Jesus! You're in love
with Zahra, aren't you?

13:15.254 --> 13:18.858
You shouldn't be in love with her,
Jeremy, you're playing with fire.

13:18.859 --> 13:21.982
No, I'm not. I'm playing with...
the opposite of fire.

13:21.983 --> 13:23.184
Water?

13:23.185 --> 13:26.869
Exactly. Thank you.
Because, yeah, obviously, I fancy Zahra,

13:26.870 --> 13:30.874
but I want to keep my nice job, so I've
decided to just be in love with her mind.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.278
A pure, modest, beautiful love.

13:33.279 --> 13:33.958
PHONE RINGS

13:33.959 --> 13:37.643
PHONE RINGS And then possibly have
a wank when we're Skyping. Hans.

13:37.644 --> 13:38.925
Jez, you need to come and get me.

13:38.926 --> 13:39.406
What's up?

13:39.407 --> 13:41.609
What's up?
I've accidentally run to Windsor.

13:41.610 --> 13:43.291
What?

13:43.292 --> 13:45.775
Yeah, I've mistakenly run to Windsor.

13:45.776 --> 13:48.098
But that's, like, in Scotland
or something, isn't it?

13:48.099 --> 13:52.103
I didn't mean to.
It's just the endorphins kicked in and...

13:52.104 --> 13:53.745
I couldn't stop.

13:53.746 --> 13:57.310
OK. Well, find some polythene or
something to pull over yourself

13:57.311 --> 14:00.755
and a bit of waste ground, and I'm
sure you'll feel fine in the morning.

14:00.756 --> 14:04.760
My legs are gone, man.
I'm a jelly. I'm paralysed.

14:04.841 --> 14:07.344
It feels fucking brilliant!

14:07.425 --> 14:09.987
God, I fancy you!
Should I make a move?

14:09.988 --> 14:11.750
I'll lose my job. I like my job.

14:11.751 --> 14:15.355
Why can't I have everything I want all the time?
Isn't that democracy?

14:15.356 --> 14:16.917
This is a great book.

14:16.918 --> 14:18.559
I adore magic realism, don't you?

14:18.560 --> 14:19.480
Love it.

14:19.481 --> 14:21.483
Love it. You know, guys don't
usually get it as a genre.

14:21.484 --> 14:22.324
Mm.

14:22.325 --> 14:23.606
Mm. Why am I not surprised
that you would?

14:23.607 --> 14:27.451
'OK, here goes.' I've been reading
a very brilliant novel lately.

14:27.452 --> 14:27.932
Yeah?

14:27.933 --> 14:30.415
Yeah? Yeah, it's about
a man and a woman.

14:30.416 --> 14:32.618
It's not set here, it's set out in...

14:32.619 --> 14:33.659
Iran.

14:33.660 --> 14:34.420
Oh.

14:34.421 --> 14:38.306
Oh. And the woman, she's with
someone else, who is the man's...

14:38.307 --> 14:41.350
um, not boss, but his...

14:41.351 --> 14:43.513
baseball coach.

14:43.514 --> 14:47.518
Yeah, and he really wants to stay
in the baseball team, the man,

14:48.000 --> 14:51.283
but he also really wants to get
together with the attractive woman.

14:51.284 --> 14:52.645
It's a great book.

14:52.646 --> 14:53.486
What's it called?

14:53.487 --> 14:55.569
What's it called?
Baseball Man.

14:55.570 --> 14:59.134
(LAUGHS) Right, I've just got to
call round my book group guys.

14:59.135 --> 15:02.458
Paul's can't host it, and Ben's
holding his poker game at mine.

15:02.459 --> 15:04.862
Well, you could have your
book group at my place,

15:04.863 --> 15:06.664
and I could fill in for Paul.

15:06.665 --> 15:08.026
You'd have to read the
book pretty quickly.

15:08.027 --> 15:10.990
No worries. 'Hope it's Mr Nice.
I've read Mr Nice.'

15:10.991 --> 15:12.192
It's Wuthering Heights.

15:12.193 --> 15:15.236
'Right. Doesn't sound like another
Howard Marks book, but fingers crossed.'

15:15.237 --> 15:16.558
Ah, brilliant.

15:16.559 --> 15:20.563
Great, then.
OK, well, why don't we...

15:20.724 --> 15:22.966
'Fuck hard, right here,
and then kill Ben?'

15:22.967 --> 15:23.888
..grab a coffee?

15:23.889 --> 15:26.531
..grab a coffee?
Super.

15:26.532 --> 15:29.856
'Kenneth's lair.
Should I? Shouldn't I?

15:29.857 --> 15:33.861
'Would Kenneth be welcomed now?
' Should I get a condom, or...?

15:34.463 --> 15:35.383
OK.

15:35.384 --> 15:36.785
OK.
They're in the sock drawer.

15:36.786 --> 15:40.790
Hang on a second, then we can
let the enjoyable sex continue.

15:42.954 --> 15:45.116
'I don't know what to do.

15:45.117 --> 15:47.319
'In a way, Kenneth, I hate you.'

15:47.320 --> 15:48.921
Sorry, they're in
here somewhere, Dobs.

15:48.922 --> 15:51.565
Sorry, they're in here somewhere, Dobs.
MOBILE PHONE BLEEPS

15:51.566 --> 15:53.768
Shit, it's from Simon.

15:53.769 --> 15:55.050
'Great.'

15:55.051 --> 15:56.932
His mum's died.

15:56.933 --> 15:58.855
'You're off duty, Kenneth.
Stand at ease.'

15:58.856 --> 16:01.939
Sorry, Mark. Is it all right if
I go over now, to see Simon?

16:01.940 --> 16:04.623
'Could I say my mum's dead?

16:04.624 --> 16:08.588
'Would Dobby maybe believe that long
enough for me to go home and shoot Mum?'

16:08.589 --> 16:12.594
I do understand it's weird, for us,
so if you'd rather I didn't...

16:13.516 --> 16:15.518
You should go. 'Nicely selfless.

16:15.519 --> 16:19.523
'I can't control what she does, but at least I
can make her feel guilty while she does it.'

16:19.764 --> 16:21.566
It's really tragic, isn't it?

16:21.567 --> 16:24.249
Very tragic indeed.

16:24.250 --> 16:25.451
Although...his mum was loaded,

16:25.452 --> 16:28.295
so Simon's going to be
a very well-off man.

16:28.296 --> 16:32.300
Is he? 'Superb(!
) Young, good-looking, sexy and now rich.

16:33.062 --> 16:36.746
'Perhaps the fucker
can also teleport.'

16:36.747 --> 16:37.507
Is that a book, Jeremy?

16:37.508 --> 16:38.549
Is that a book, Jeremy?
Yes, it's a book.

16:38.550 --> 16:39.790
Why shouldn't it be a book?

16:39.791 --> 16:40.872
Why do you have it?

16:40.873 --> 16:42.434
I'm going to read it, Mark.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.397
You're going to read a book?
You hate reading.

16:44.398 --> 16:46.800
No, I don't. I love reading.

16:46.801 --> 16:50.485
I read Mr Nice four times.
I read The Bunny Suicides.

16:50.486 --> 16:53.809
Look, I've offered to host
Zahra's book group, OK?

16:53.810 --> 16:56.653
And now Shitty Ben's decided he's
coming because it's happening here

16:56.654 --> 16:59.217
and he's all jealous and
suspicious, so what I thought was,

16:59.218 --> 17:03.222
even though I can't tell Ben to
fuck off, I can defeat him mentally

17:03.624 --> 17:06.787
at the book group and impress
Zahra by saying clever things.

17:06.788 --> 17:10.792
So I'm going to read all of
this book, from page one to...

17:12.796 --> 17:16.800
Oh, shit! ..372?!

17:17.563 --> 17:20.445
How's the book going? Enjoying it?

17:20.446 --> 17:24.330
I look at it, I read the
words, or think I do,

17:24.332 --> 17:28.336
but then I get distracted, or I don't
quite take it in, and I have to go back.

17:28.778 --> 17:32.021
I've been on the same four
pages for three hours.

17:32.022 --> 17:33.223
I see.

17:33.224 --> 17:36.227
Mark, how do you read?
Can you teach me to read?

17:36.228 --> 17:37.749
You want me to teach you to read?

17:37.750 --> 17:39.511
Yes. I mean, not literally.

17:39.512 --> 17:41.835
But how do you concentrate?
Please, tell me.

17:41.836 --> 17:44.879
Well, turn the telly off for a start.

17:44.880 --> 17:47.963
'Oh, turn the telly off.
Everything bad starts with, "Turn the telly off".'

17:47.964 --> 17:51.648
OK, start reading that
long paragraph there.

17:51.649 --> 17:53.771
Right.

17:53.772 --> 17:57.336
You probably feel like looking
away from the page now, don't you?

17:57.337 --> 17:58.217
Yes. Yes, I do.

17:58.218 --> 18:01.261
Yes. Yes, I do. Don't look away.
Stay with it.

18:01.262 --> 18:04.385
'Fascinating. It's like watching a
sheep trying to use an iPhone.'

18:04.386 --> 18:07.429
Oh, it's too difficult!
I mean, the story's told by a man,

18:07.430 --> 18:09.672
and then a lady, and then no-one.

18:09.673 --> 18:12.436
Why can't we read something
simple, like Mr Nice?

18:12.437 --> 18:14.639
Well, why don't you talk
about Mr Nice instead?

18:14.640 --> 18:18.645
About all the different times Mr
Nice got high, to different extents.

18:19.166 --> 18:23.171
Right, I'm going to sit outside on the
balcony all night and finish this book.

18:23.372 --> 18:25.414
That way I'll be cold and
I won't fall asleep.

18:25.415 --> 18:29.419
'There he is, the Captain Oates of
having to read a relatively short book.'

18:32.825 --> 18:36.829
I can't do it, Mark.
It's 372 pages long and I'm freezing.

18:37.071 --> 18:37.670
My legs!

18:37.671 --> 18:39.633
My legs!
So, what I was thinking was,

18:39.634 --> 18:43.278
could you read it for me, the
stupid olden-days book, please?

18:43.279 --> 18:46.002
I'm not staying up all night
reading Wuthering Heights.

18:46.003 --> 18:48.525
Please. I'll do the washing-up
every day until I die,

18:48.526 --> 18:50.608
and then my children will do
the washing-up after that.

18:50.609 --> 18:54.613
Look, I'm broke and you're
relatively moneyed, so...

18:56.657 --> 18:59.700
Are we doing a deal? A grubby deal?

18:59.701 --> 19:03.065
Like oilmen or corrupt councillors?

19:03.066 --> 19:05.588
Deals happen every day, Jeremy.
Buying a Twix is a deal.

19:05.589 --> 19:08.552
Paying for the toilet
at Euston is a deal.

19:08.553 --> 19:10.515
I'll read the book,

19:10.516 --> 19:13.879
I'll look at some online
criticism, but for a price.

19:13.880 --> 19:16.163
You massive prostitute!

19:16.164 --> 19:17.765
I am not a prostitute.

19:17.766 --> 19:21.770
Now, please get out of my bed.

19:22.973 --> 19:26.977
Best to have Pringles in bowls,
otherwise you get Pringle Hand.

19:27.259 --> 19:30.141
I think if Rod Hull and
Emu were still alive,

19:30.142 --> 19:32.905
they definitely would have used
them to advertise Pringles.

19:32.906 --> 19:36.911
Yes. So, the birthday weekend's going
ahead if you're still up for it?

19:37.432 --> 19:39.354
All the complimentary
shower caps we can wear

19:39.355 --> 19:41.837
and proper cafetieres in the rooms.

19:41.838 --> 19:45.442
Mark, you're unemployed.
You can't afford that. Don't be silly.

19:45.443 --> 19:46.724
No, it's fine...

19:46.725 --> 19:47.966
Mark, listen.

19:47.967 --> 19:49.207
Yes. Listening.

19:49.208 --> 19:51.571
I'm not still into Simon, OK?

19:51.572 --> 19:55.496
His mum died, he was sad,
I made him a boiled egg.

19:55.497 --> 19:58.540
Stop waiting for all this to blow
up, because it's not going to

19:58.541 --> 20:01.905
unless you detonate your
mad, paranoid, bomb vest.

20:01.906 --> 20:02.986
Sorry.

20:02.987 --> 20:04.508
How about we ditch the book freaks

20:04.509 --> 20:07.712
and head back to my place, yeah?
You look like you need to be in bed.

20:07.713 --> 20:10.436
Well, I am very tired, Iwas
up half the night reading...

20:10.437 --> 20:14.442
Oh, I see! Yeah. Got you. Bed.

20:14.763 --> 20:16.364
Lovely.

20:16.365 --> 20:17.486
They're ready, Mark.

20:17.487 --> 20:21.491
Yes, something else has come up, Jez.
I can't do the book group.

20:21.572 --> 20:23.574
No, Mark, we made a deal.

20:23.575 --> 20:26.137
Remember - a grubby deal?
You've got to defeat Ben.

20:26.138 --> 20:27.659
I need to renege on the deal, Jez.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.023
I really have got something
else I'd rather do.

20:30.024 --> 20:32.346
Mark, I need you.

20:32.347 --> 20:34.709
I haven't read the book.

20:34.710 --> 20:36.952
(ZAHRA) Jeremy!

20:36.953 --> 20:40.637
We thought we'd let you
start, as it's your place.

20:40.638 --> 20:43.681
'We're letting you castrate
yourself as it's your penknife.'

20:43.682 --> 20:44.322
Away you go.

20:44.323 --> 20:47.006
Away you go. Great.
'What do I say? I'm pretty sure

20:47.007 --> 20:50.210
'it's a love story.
Can I compare it to another love story?

20:50.211 --> 20:51.732
'The film Love Story, maybe?'

20:51.733 --> 20:53.615
Well, as a love story...

20:53.616 --> 20:56.459
I'm sorry, as a what?

20:56.460 --> 20:57.900
A love story?

20:57.901 --> 21:00.384
Come on, Jez!
This isn't a fucking love story.

21:00.385 --> 21:03.508
It's a fucking fuck story.
It's about animal lusts and earth

21:03.509 --> 21:07.514
and dirt and fluids, not love, art,
companionship, all that rubbish.

21:08.155 --> 21:08.835
DOORBELL

21:08.836 --> 21:10.798
DOORBELL 'I hate you.'

21:10.799 --> 21:12.080
Crack.

21:12.081 --> 21:13.762
There you go.

21:13.763 --> 21:17.487
Cheers.

21:17.488 --> 21:20.411
Wuthering Heights is so
obviously an exploration of,

21:20.412 --> 21:22.694
you know, wild elemental forces...

21:22.695 --> 21:26.700
(WHISPERS) Jeremy's right, he's a shit.
Can we go in for five minutes, Dobs?

21:27.141 --> 21:30.425
...as an ode to dark
passions and a kind of...

21:30.426 --> 21:33.469
Savage rhapsody?
Sorry, Ben, very easily done

21:33.470 --> 21:36.313
but I think you might
accidentally be giving opinions

21:36.314 --> 21:40.118
from quite a well-known online essay
on Wuthering Heights as your own...

21:40.119 --> 21:42.481
'Fuck you!
Mark's going into bat for me.'

21:42.482 --> 21:43.923
..hasn't understood the book at all.

21:43.924 --> 21:46.046
Wuthering Heights isn't a
hymn to lust and passion...

21:46.047 --> 21:49.490
'And he's really good at this, unlike
any game actually involving a bat.'

21:49.491 --> 21:52.695
...gothic nonsense is, and how
it inevitably has to give way

21:52.696 --> 21:55.779
to real life and real love.

21:55.780 --> 21:57.782
Wow. Blimey, Mark, you sound
like an intellectual,

21:57.783 --> 22:00.305
like...Tony Parsons or something.

22:00.306 --> 22:03.069
'This is what I was born to do.

22:03.070 --> 22:06.033
'It's like Robert Robinson fucked
Joan Bakewell and they had me.'

22:06.034 --> 22:09.077
Right, screw this. I'm off.

22:09.078 --> 22:12.882
Bunch of fucking pseuds.

22:12.883 --> 22:16.647
Well, shall we cool off, put our
big hot brains on ice for five?

22:16.648 --> 22:18.009
Back to yours?

22:18.010 --> 22:21.454
Sounds like a plan, Stan.

22:21.455 --> 22:22.776
Thanks, mate.

22:22.777 --> 22:25.059
It's all right, Jez, I'm
just off to Dobby's,

22:25.060 --> 22:28.303
and I don't think I'll be needing to
be "friends with Kenneth" any more.

22:28.304 --> 22:32.308
OK. D'you think Kenneth might
have been made redundant?

22:32.550 --> 22:35.232
Indeed.
I think Kenneth can take a hike.

22:35.233 --> 22:39.238
(CHUCKLES)

22:39.319 --> 22:43.323
Kenneth is what Mark calls
his nine-inch dildo.

22:51.536 --> 22:55.540
# Paranoia, paranoia
Everybody's coming to get me

22:56.663 --> 22:59.626
# Just say you never met me

22:59.627 --> 23:03.631
# I'm running underground with
the moles, digging holes. #
