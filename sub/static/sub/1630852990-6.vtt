00:07.257 --> 00:08.717
Nick Harp killed your father?

00:08.800 --> 00:13.096
No, he handed a gun to a woman
who did, and he's still out there.

00:13.179 --> 00:15.223
Can I speak with Andrea Oliver, please?

00:15.306 --> 00:16.975
<i>I believe she's staying with you.</i>

00:17.058 --> 00:19.811
I'm sorry. Andrea has left.

00:20.395 --> 00:22.230
I think your uncle
has a contact in WITSEC.

00:22.313 --> 00:23.440
Jasper sent that guy?

00:23.523 --> 00:26.317
What if he wanted that suitcase?
I think that money's evidence.

00:26.401 --> 00:28.069
- Where is it?
- Back in my hotel room.

00:28.153 --> 00:29.279
Sorry.

00:29.362 --> 00:32.407
Mike? I got you. Call 911!

00:32.490 --> 00:35.326
<i>My mom knew Nick Harp. They were together.</i>

00:35.410 --> 00:37.996
It's easy, Jane.
You choose. Me or your father?

00:41.916 --> 00:44.210
<i>Everyone, Jane has come back to us.</i>

00:44.294 --> 00:45.545
This is Grace Juno.

00:45.628 --> 00:50.633
Her husband and three children are dead.
The man responsible is your father.

00:51.926 --> 00:53.094
We could use your help.

01:32.383 --> 01:33.551
What are you doing?

01:35.178 --> 01:36.554
These files are a mess.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.348
What are you, Dad's secretary now?

01:39.849 --> 01:41.351
Scared I'm taking your place?

01:42.477 --> 01:43.895
I know you're still seeing Nick.

01:43.978 --> 01:45.855
That's been over since the summer.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.398
Give me some credit, Jane.

01:47.482 --> 01:50.026
I'm not the moron
you and Andrew think I am.

01:51.694 --> 01:55.949
Jasper. I told the board you'd be hosting
the company Christmas party

01:56.032 --> 01:58.535
since Jane will be joining me in Oslo.

01:58.618 --> 02:00.495
Yeah. Sure, no problem.

02:00.578 --> 02:02.330
I'd like a word with your sister.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.048
I think it's cocktail hour.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.551
- The usual?
- No, no, you relax.

02:15.426 --> 02:17.220
I know you're not feeling well.

02:17.303 --> 02:18.513
Still nauseous?

02:18.596 --> 02:19.430
I'm fine.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.059
You need to take better care of yourself.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.104
You're very precious to me.

02:28.898 --> 02:30.650
I want you safe and sound.

02:48.084 --> 02:48.918
Here.

02:57.051 --> 02:58.011
How's the hand?

02:59.053 --> 02:59.888
Better.

03:00.805 --> 03:02.098
I was so clumsy.

03:05.184 --> 03:06.895
Did Nick give you the idea?

03:06.978 --> 03:08.313
To ruin your career?

03:10.690 --> 03:13.359
Jane, I'm your father,
it's my job to protect you.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.779
Nick isn't going to do
any more damage to you

03:16.863 --> 03:19.449
or to anyone, and I'll make sure of that.

03:20.992 --> 03:24.120
He can't have you.
Can't have any part of you.

03:25.079 --> 03:26.331
You belong with me.

03:29.792 --> 03:31.210
It'll be good to get away.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.255
We can… start over.

03:38.009 --> 03:38.927
To Oslo.

03:40.845 --> 03:41.679
Oslo.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.401
<i>I always win, Jane.</i>

03:56.402 --> 03:57.237
<i>You know that.</i>

03:59.530 --> 04:00.365
Excuse me?

04:02.242 --> 04:03.159
Ma'am?

04:05.119 --> 04:06.371
If you'll follow me?

04:06.454 --> 04:07.497
Yeah.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.850
Have Sophie cancel
the rest of the day.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.520
Mr. Queller will need
90 minutes to get to the meeting.

04:30.603 --> 04:34.232
Senator Shepard absolutely hates
when people are late. Do not fuck this up.

04:47.453 --> 04:48.830
It's good to see you again.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.000
How long are you in town?

04:53.876 --> 04:55.545
Well, that depends on my brother.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.047
Mr. Queller's waiting.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.653
It's, uh… It's really you.

05:23.740 --> 05:24.824
Hello, Jasper.

05:39.047 --> 05:39.881
Jane.

05:41.883 --> 05:42.800
You look good.

05:45.595 --> 05:48.264
You… look like him.

05:48.347 --> 05:50.099
God, don't say that.

05:55.396 --> 05:56.981
That's his desk, isn't it?

06:00.276 --> 06:01.903
Yeah. Remember how bored we were

06:01.986 --> 06:04.363
when he dragged us
to his office on the weekend?

06:05.907 --> 06:07.950
You sat behind that desk
when you got the chance.

06:08.034 --> 06:11.037
You begged me
to take a photo of you lying on top of it.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.039
Did I?

06:13.539 --> 06:14.957
Mm-hmm.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.167
In sunglasses.

06:18.252 --> 06:19.837
I must have blocked that out.

06:19.921 --> 06:20.838
Well…

06:21.798 --> 06:23.674
We all do things we'd rather forget.

06:29.347 --> 06:30.807
Where's my daughter?

06:30.890 --> 06:34.268
Andrea left early this morning.
I was… I was a bit surprised.

06:34.977 --> 06:36.938
I, I haven't heard from her.
Have, have you?

06:40.441 --> 06:42.318
- Why did she leave?
- I don't know.

06:42.401 --> 06:45.780
That's it? "I don't know?"
Come on. You can do better than that.

06:45.863 --> 06:48.950
I think she was pretty upset
by how little you've told her.

06:50.368 --> 06:51.953
She hasn't even heard you play.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.207
I was in witness protection.

06:56.290 --> 06:57.375
Those are the rules.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.043
I was curious.

07:00.419 --> 07:02.296
What sort of deal you made with them?

07:05.424 --> 07:07.301
You mean what did I say about you?

07:09.345 --> 07:11.889
You always cared too much
what other people think.

07:13.724 --> 07:14.809
Dad hated that.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.061
Yeah.

07:17.812 --> 07:21.441
Well, things have changed.
Dad's gone. It's my show now.

07:25.319 --> 07:28.072
I could ruin your political career
with one phone call.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.453
Well, I wouldn't try that if I were you.

07:42.670 --> 07:44.755
Well, Jane,
you've been gone for a long time.

07:44.839 --> 07:48.551
I'm guessig there are
all sorts of things you'd, uh, like to do.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.888
Oh, yeah. But right now,
I'm trying to find my daughter.

07:55.558 --> 07:56.767
Last night…

07:59.061 --> 08:00.563
Andrea asked me about Nick.

08:01.564 --> 08:02.690
I didn't say much.

08:04.984 --> 08:07.278
Maybe she's trying
to find out more about him.

08:09.906 --> 08:13.242
- Have you heard from him?
- No. No, I'd call the FBI in a heartbeat.

08:15.786 --> 08:16.913
He saw me on the news.

08:17.580 --> 08:22.001
I think he's come back.
So, you see my concern about Andrea.

08:22.084 --> 08:24.462
If anything happens to her--

08:24.545 --> 08:27.798
My security team
is at your disposal anytime.

08:34.764 --> 08:35.932
Oh, you're not leaving.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.434
Well, you can't keep
Senator Shepard waiting.

08:40.603 --> 08:43.856
You know, you really did pull it off.
Redeeming the family name.

08:44.815 --> 08:47.902
The sins of the father,
washed clean by the son.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.364
It's a good story.

09:17.348 --> 09:19.559
- Hello?
- <i>Charlie, it's me.</i>

09:20.476 --> 09:21.519
I need your help.

09:22.311 --> 09:23.646
<i>Well, I tried helping you.</i>

09:24.146 --> 09:27.149
<i>It's… It's Andy. She's missing.</i>

09:29.068 --> 09:30.403
Call the FBI.

09:30.486 --> 09:32.363
That's what they do. Missing persons.

09:33.030 --> 09:34.323
<i>Charlie, please.</i>

09:34.991 --> 09:36.492
This isn't a good time, Jane.

09:37.201 --> 09:39.704
<i>What about that Marshal</i>
<i>who was assigned to her?</i>

09:39.787 --> 09:41.706
<i>Michael Vargas. Where is he?</i>

09:41.789 --> 09:43.374
<i>Would they still be in contact?</i>

09:44.709 --> 09:47.378
I don't know.
And even if I did, I couldn't tell you.

09:47.461 --> 09:50.506
Look, I wouldn't be
calling you if it wasn't serious.

09:50.589 --> 09:51.841
<i>We're done, Jane.</i>

09:53.009 --> 09:55.386
That's what you wanted,
and that's for the best.

09:55.469 --> 09:58.723
Andy went to Jasper's,
and now she has disappeared.

09:58.806 --> 10:00.141
Something is very wrong.

10:02.810 --> 10:04.603
<i>Charlie, please.</i>

10:07.982 --> 10:08.858
<i>Please.</i>

12:54.899 --> 12:55.900
It's all here.

12:57.067 --> 12:57.985
Don't touch that.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.321
Nice jacket.

13:00.946 --> 13:01.780
Let's go.

13:14.335 --> 13:16.378
- Take the service lane.

13:16.462 --> 13:17.838
Too much traffic…

13:19.924 --> 13:21.926
- Lot of traffic.
- Really?

14:55.352 --> 14:57.938
<i>Hey, this is Andy.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

14:59.440 --> 15:00.608
Honey, it's me.

15:00.691 --> 15:01.817
Uh…

15:01.901 --> 15:05.362
I don't know if you're checking
your voicemail. Probably not, but, um…

15:07.323 --> 15:08.157
I'm here.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.119
I'm in San Francisco.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.205
And I'm looking for you.

15:17.708 --> 15:21.295
When you were little, you used to hate it
when I told you to be careful.

15:22.379 --> 15:26.050
Maybe you felt like I didn't think
you could take care of yourself, but…

15:27.259 --> 15:30.721
You'd say, "I'm being careful."

15:34.099 --> 15:35.476
And I knew that you were.

15:37.144 --> 15:38.395
And I know that you are.

15:40.147 --> 15:41.398
But there are just

15:42.650 --> 15:45.027
some things you don't understand.
I'm trying to…

15:50.407 --> 15:52.701
I've lost so many people. I just…

15:53.786 --> 15:56.121
I don't know
what I'd do if I lost you too.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.877
So, call me, okay?

16:02.419 --> 16:03.629
Call me if you get this.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.950
So sorry for your loss.

16:40.207 --> 16:41.291
<i>Lost something?</i>

16:43.168 --> 16:45.963
If you find a credible argument
in there, let us know.

16:49.675 --> 16:50.509
Jane.

16:53.262 --> 16:54.179
You're high.

16:55.472 --> 16:56.306
You want some?

16:58.100 --> 16:59.518
I guess we're orphans now.

17:02.229 --> 17:03.814
I hated him for so long.

17:05.441 --> 17:09.153
- If I thought Grace was going--
- No, don't. Don't do that.

17:09.778 --> 17:10.863
Jane…

17:16.535 --> 17:17.745
What was that about?

17:17.828 --> 17:20.581
He's convinced that
the Army of the Changing World's

17:20.664 --> 17:21.707
gonna come for him next.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.792
After the board makes him CEO?

17:23.876 --> 17:26.044
Yeah, well,
the FBI's here to hold his hand.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.133
What are they doing here?

17:32.259 --> 17:35.179
Maplecroft's ransom note
was on the cover of the <i>Chronicle.</i>

17:35.262 --> 17:36.972
Whole city's on edge.

17:39.808 --> 17:40.893
Look…

17:41.477 --> 17:43.187
Draw this out as long as you can.

17:43.896 --> 17:44.855
I should get going.

17:45.689 --> 17:47.066
We don't need that money.

17:47.149 --> 17:48.859
Look, it's not about the money.

17:49.526 --> 17:51.070
We need to send a message.

17:51.153 --> 17:54.031
- People need to know what we stand for.
- He's right.

17:54.865 --> 17:57.868
- Come on.
- No. You should stay here with Jane.

18:00.579 --> 18:01.955
You're going to get caught.

18:02.539 --> 18:03.624
No, I'm not.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.001
I'm just getting started.

18:31.026 --> 18:34.530
Act up!
Fight back! Fight AIDS!

18:43.747 --> 18:46.500
Act up! Fight back! Fight AIDS!

19:36.925 --> 19:37.926
Fuck you, pig!

19:39.928 --> 19:40.888
Oh, God!

19:43.515 --> 19:49.021
Act up! Fight back! Fight AIDS!

23:26.029 --> 23:28.240
- Yeah?
- <i>Charlie, you were right.</i>

23:28.323 --> 23:30.826
Michael Vargas was here and so was Andy.

23:30.909 --> 23:33.036
Vargas was supposed to be
on a flight to Atlanta.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.621
He never showed up.

23:34.704 --> 23:36.540
Didn't log in some evidence either.

23:37.582 --> 23:38.542
What evidence?

23:38.625 --> 23:39.751
<i>I don't know yet.</i>

23:40.377 --> 23:44.214
<i>But he also read your full WITSEC report.</i>
<i>Which he was not authorized to do.</i>

23:48.385 --> 23:50.512
You think he told Andy what was in it?

23:50.595 --> 23:51.471
<i>Maybe.</i>

23:52.514 --> 23:53.849
<i>You find anything?</i>

23:54.975 --> 23:55.892
No.

23:56.643 --> 24:00.397
<i>I don't know exactly what's going on,</i>
<i>but you need to get off the street.</i>

24:00.480 --> 24:01.815
Not until Andy's safe.

24:03.817 --> 24:04.651
Hello?

25:09.549 --> 25:11.092
Hurry up. We're gonna be late.

25:11.843 --> 25:12.677
So call him.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.609
Can I give you a hand?

25:28.276 --> 25:29.903
No, thanks. We got it.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.489
Run into some trouble?

25:33.323 --> 25:36.743
Alcatraz. He tripped trying
to get the perfect selfie.

25:36.826 --> 25:37.869
Where you folks from?

25:38.495 --> 25:39.412
Texas.

25:39.496 --> 25:41.081
Long way from home.

25:41.164 --> 25:42.916
We should get moving.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.126
- You ready, honey?
- Yeah.

25:45.794 --> 25:46.711
Let's go.

25:52.884 --> 25:54.052
Don't forget your jack.

25:55.804 --> 25:56.638
Thanks.

26:15.198 --> 26:18.785
…twenty-one, 22, 23,

26:19.577 --> 26:24.833
twenty-four, 25, 26, 27…

26:25.709 --> 26:27.335
You're dead. Do it again.

26:38.555 --> 26:40.807
Eli. You're a lifesaver.

26:40.890 --> 26:42.767
Jane, this is Clara and Eli.

26:42.851 --> 26:43.977
<i>What happened?</i>

26:44.060 --> 26:47.897
- <i>…11, 12, 13…</i>
- We made it. We're okay.

26:47.981 --> 26:49.232
Fits, close…

26:49.316 --> 26:51.109
- Whatever you need.
<i>- …16…</i>

26:51.192 --> 26:52.902
<i>Gotta save your own life, Jane!</i>

27:13.006 --> 27:13.840
Excuse me.

27:15.216 --> 27:16.051
Eli?

27:16.718 --> 27:17.552
Yeah?

27:19.804 --> 27:20.638
It's Jane.

27:24.017 --> 27:24.851
My God.

27:28.146 --> 27:29.647
Could I come inside?

28:14.025 --> 28:15.693
<i>I'm sorry about Clara.</i>

28:18.696 --> 28:19.906
Are you?

28:19.989 --> 28:21.241
Thank you.

28:21.324 --> 28:23.159
You didn't call. Send a note.

28:24.536 --> 28:25.578
Nothing.

28:28.498 --> 28:30.500
- I--
- What are you doing here, Jane?

28:33.336 --> 28:36.840
I'm looking for Andy.
I thought maybe she'd come by.

28:36.923 --> 28:38.216
Is she all right?

28:38.299 --> 28:41.302
No, yeah. I-I-I'll find her.
It really was a long shot.

28:45.432 --> 28:49.477
What about, uh…
You still have the, the, the farm?

28:49.561 --> 28:52.355
Don't get up there much,
too many memories.

28:53.314 --> 28:58.445
Andy always seemed so… happy there.

28:59.237 --> 29:02.115
Sometimes, I wonder if Andy
should have stayed with you.

29:02.782 --> 29:04.576
It always seemed so easy for Clara.

29:05.869 --> 29:09.497
- What did?
- Well, being a mother.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.125
Turns out, I've never been any good at it.

29:13.334 --> 29:15.503
You want somebody to let you off the hook?

29:18.548 --> 29:19.424
I can't help you.

29:54.334 --> 29:55.168
Hi.

29:56.169 --> 29:57.545
<i>Heading to the airport.</i>

29:58.254 --> 29:59.380
Why, what is it?

29:59.964 --> 30:03.343
Michael Vargas is in critical condition
at San Francisco General.

30:04.010 --> 30:05.136
<i>What? What happened?</i>

30:05.762 --> 30:08.139
<i>- Not sure yet. Maybe a stroke.</i>

30:09.098 --> 30:10.850
Is Andy with him?

30:10.934 --> 30:13.728
No, but paramedics said
a woman matching her description

30:13.812 --> 30:15.355
was there when they showed up.

30:16.314 --> 30:17.273
<i>Oh, God.</i>

30:17.357 --> 30:18.983
Andy may have taken his phone.

30:19.067 --> 30:21.444
Well, have you tried calling her?

30:21.528 --> 30:22.654
<i>It's his personal phone.</i>

30:23.279 --> 30:24.781
I'm chasing down the number.

30:24.864 --> 30:29.327
Okay. Well, um, I'll be waiting.
And… Charlie?

30:30.745 --> 30:31.579
Yeah.

30:33.331 --> 30:34.499
Thank you.

30:35.708 --> 30:36.709
Yeah.

31:13.371 --> 31:14.205
Hi.

31:51.075 --> 31:52.243
Hey, nice hair.

31:52.327 --> 31:54.203
I brought as much food as I could.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.081
Were you followed?

31:57.874 --> 31:59.584
- No.
- Are you sure?

32:01.377 --> 32:02.295
I'm sure.

32:06.549 --> 32:07.926
We need to get out of here.

32:08.468 --> 32:10.303
This neighborhood is crawling with cops.

32:10.386 --> 32:12.930
- Looking for Alex Maplecroft.
- Need to sit tight.

32:13.014 --> 32:15.975
- Didn't get into this to sit around.
- I didn't wanna kill anybody.

32:16.059 --> 32:20.313
- Asshole deserved it.
- Settle down. We'll talk later.

32:30.490 --> 32:31.407
Did you get it?

32:32.241 --> 32:33.785
The money's safe. Don't worry.

32:36.079 --> 32:39.666
Audrey Hepburn wouldn't know it
if the FBI held a tea party up her ass.

32:42.293 --> 32:43.795
Let's take another look.

33:01.312 --> 33:02.313
Nick?

33:02.981 --> 33:03.856
Yeah.

33:03.940 --> 33:05.066
Maybe we should…

33:07.151 --> 33:08.653
- What?
- Make it stop?

33:15.576 --> 33:19.205
We can explain Grace was unstable,
we never meant to--

33:19.288 --> 33:21.332
- Explain to…
- The police.

33:25.086 --> 33:25.920
Right.

33:27.380 --> 33:30.299
Okay. Yeah, because
you and Andrew, you'll be fine.

33:31.300 --> 33:33.803
You gonna come visit
the rest of us in lockup sometime?

33:34.429 --> 33:35.722
If we don't fry first.

33:46.774 --> 33:48.401
We let Maplecroft go tomorrow.

33:49.485 --> 33:50.319
That's the plan.

33:52.822 --> 33:53.656
Your turn.

34:19.766 --> 34:21.100
I brought you some water.

34:28.566 --> 34:29.400
Mm.

34:52.256 --> 34:53.091
Stop!

34:59.764 --> 35:02.391
Help! Nick! Help!

35:03.226 --> 35:04.227
What the fuck?

35:26.499 --> 35:28.417
- Quarter's been shot!
- What?

35:28.501 --> 35:30.419
What the fuck?

35:38.636 --> 35:39.887
We gotta get out.

35:39.971 --> 35:42.181
Come on. Come on.

35:43.391 --> 35:44.350
Jane, come on!

35:58.030 --> 35:59.490
We've got movement!

36:28.686 --> 36:29.979
Is tunnel secured?

36:34.192 --> 36:35.568
Stop right there!

36:45.369 --> 36:46.787
Hey, go, go, go! Come on!

37:51.519 --> 37:54.188
- You took your fucking time.
- Car trouble.

37:55.106 --> 37:57.566
- What about that marshal?
- Out of the way.

37:58.943 --> 38:01.362
- Well, do you have it?
- Yeah.

38:01.445 --> 38:03.990
- I don't have all night.
- In the trunk.

38:05.741 --> 38:06.575
Show me.

39:06.802 --> 39:08.471
We have a situation here.

39:10.056 --> 39:10.890
It's gone.

39:11.682 --> 39:12.808
Gone where?

39:14.518 --> 39:15.644
<i>I don't know.</i>

39:16.479 --> 39:17.897
<i>But they've been dealt with.</i>

39:18.773 --> 39:20.191
<i>You can clean up the mess.</i>

40:03.401 --> 40:04.610
Andy!

40:06.570 --> 40:07.696
Andy?

40:09.907 --> 40:11.283
Come back, Andy!

40:13.953 --> 40:14.787
Andy!

40:41.647 --> 40:42.481
Hello?

41:27.067 --> 41:28.903
<i>You should eat something.</i>

41:29.945 --> 41:30.779
I'm okay.

41:32.990 --> 41:34.033
You don't look okay.

41:38.621 --> 41:40.039
How'd you get Mike's number?

41:43.209 --> 41:44.043
Charlie.

41:45.878 --> 41:48.088
- Charlie works in--
- Yeah, I know who he is.

41:50.174 --> 41:51.800
Tell me if I get anything wrong…

41:52.968 --> 41:55.262
You're not an only child
from Rhode Island.

41:55.346 --> 41:57.640
You have a brother
in the running for vice president,

41:57.723 --> 42:02.228
and the other one, the one I'm named for,
was in some cult that killed your father.

42:04.230 --> 42:07.358
Jerry Randall didn't die in a car crash
'cause he never existed.

42:07.441 --> 42:10.528
Everything I think I know about him,
you and Charlie made up.

42:16.075 --> 42:17.076
I'm sorry.

42:19.036 --> 42:19.870
Are you?

42:22.039 --> 42:26.252
You have… every right to be angry.

42:28.003 --> 42:30.214
It's Nick Harp, isn't it?

42:32.049 --> 42:34.176
I know you were with him. I saw the video.

42:41.225 --> 42:42.977
You know that's not who I am.

42:43.060 --> 42:45.604
Honestly, I don't have
the first fucking clue.

42:45.688 --> 42:48.649
I keep waiting for something real
to come out of your mouth.

42:50.818 --> 42:51.735
Is he my father?

42:58.576 --> 42:59.410
Yes.

43:10.337 --> 43:14.174
And were you part of that group?

43:21.682 --> 43:23.350
I did anything Nick wanted.

43:27.354 --> 43:28.772
I mean, until Oslo.

43:29.523 --> 43:34.236
I mean, I knew he hated Martin,
but I didn't think he would…

43:35.946 --> 43:38.699
And did you ever think
I might want to know all this?

43:38.782 --> 43:42.119
You know what I thought?
I thought, what if I wake up one night

43:42.202 --> 43:45.664
and Nick is just standing right there?

43:45.748 --> 43:49.627
Or what if I take you to school
or the movies or the beach

43:49.710 --> 43:51.253
and he's just waiting?

43:54.214 --> 43:56.634
You could have told me at some point.

43:56.717 --> 43:57.885
What was I supposed to say?

43:57.968 --> 44:01.722
Your father is wanted by the FBI,
and he would kill us if he got the chance?

44:03.849 --> 44:07.186
As long as I am alive,
I can testify against him.

44:13.567 --> 44:14.860
What about the money?

44:16.862 --> 44:19.114
I know it's the ransom
for Alex Maplecroft.

44:20.115 --> 44:20.949
Why keep it?

44:22.117 --> 44:23.369
Honestly, I thought,

44:24.870 --> 44:26.663
if Nick did find us, we'd need it.

44:27.665 --> 44:28.957
Because we'd have to run.

44:30.376 --> 44:31.877
So, why does Jasper want it?

44:34.588 --> 44:35.422
Jasper?

44:36.006 --> 44:37.508
He tried to kill me to get it.

44:40.135 --> 44:42.930
Uh, I don't know. Somebody came after me.

44:43.013 --> 44:43.931
Oh, my God.

44:47.601 --> 44:49.186
I can't believe my brother would…

44:50.312 --> 44:52.564
- What is it about that money?
- I don't know.

44:52.648 --> 44:53.524
Yes, you do.

44:53.607 --> 44:58.070
No. It was for us.
It's all it ever was. I swear.

45:03.409 --> 45:04.535
I'm calling the FBI.

45:07.913 --> 45:08.747
Andy, no.

45:10.290 --> 45:11.792
Nick is out there somewhere.

45:13.168 --> 45:14.128
And you just…

45:15.212 --> 45:17.423
You just need to… disappear.

45:18.507 --> 45:21.260
Okay? Charlie's flying in,
and when he gets here,

45:21.343 --> 45:22.469
we'll find the Marshals.

45:22.553 --> 45:24.096
No, we can't go to them.

45:24.179 --> 45:26.223
Mike thinks there's some kind of leak.

45:26.306 --> 45:28.600
Everywhere we went,
they knew how to find us.

45:29.351 --> 45:32.062
Well, then you have to leave.
You cannot be a part of this.

45:32.146 --> 45:34.815
- I'm already a part of this.
- No, you've been through enough.

45:34.898 --> 45:35.732
Mom.

45:36.608 --> 45:37.901
I'm not letting this go.

45:47.578 --> 45:48.537
Okay.

45:51.457 --> 45:53.125
All right. Here's what we're gonna do.

45:53.792 --> 45:55.878
We're gonna find
the nearest police station,

45:55.961 --> 45:58.088
and we'll call the FBI.

46:03.510 --> 46:04.344
Okay.

46:06.972 --> 46:08.015
Yeah, okay.

46:10.809 --> 46:12.144
Do you have any chapstick?

46:12.895 --> 46:13.854
Yeah.

46:15.564 --> 46:16.398
Here.

46:18.150 --> 46:19.318
I'm glad you're here.

46:41.340 --> 46:42.174
You ready?

46:44.343 --> 46:46.220
Will you settle up while I use the ladies?

46:46.303 --> 46:47.137
Sure.

46:57.940 --> 46:58.899
Thank you.

47:01.443 --> 47:02.945
Hey, how was everything?

47:03.028 --> 47:06.365
- Fine.
- Okay, that'll be $12.50.

47:10.327 --> 47:11.662
<i>Come back, Andy!</i>

47:13.330 --> 47:14.164
Miss?

47:15.624 --> 47:18.126
Miss? Your total is $12.50.

47:18.627 --> 47:20.128
Oh. Sorry.

48:00.252 --> 48:01.920
You were just gonna leave me?

48:03.380 --> 48:06.341
- Andy, move!
- No!

48:10.470 --> 48:12.598
I have to go. Just wait for Charlie.

48:12.681 --> 48:14.641
- Where are you going?
- You have to trust me.

48:14.725 --> 48:16.476
Why the fuck would I do that?
