WEBVTT

00:09.642 --> 00:12.611
I'm gettin'
splinters in my keister!

00:12.613 --> 00:16.280
How come I got stuck sharing
a disguise with Groot?

00:16.283 --> 00:18.317
I am Groot.

00:18.319 --> 00:21.931
Because I could only get my hands
on four Nova Corps uniforms,

00:21.956 --> 00:24.628
and they don't exactly
make them in rodent size.

00:24.655 --> 00:27.326
Just had to go there,
didn't ya?

00:27.351 --> 00:31.520
Will you two focus, so we can get
the Pandorian crystal we came for?

00:31.545 --> 00:33.278
This plan is unethical.

00:34.539 --> 00:36.304
Stealing is for common criminals.

00:36.329 --> 00:37.891
We're not stealing.

00:37.922 --> 00:40.639
We're returning the crystal
to its rightful owner.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.541
And by that, I mean
the CryptoCube.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.356
So basically, I mean me.

00:44.381 --> 00:47.226
Holy Krutack.
They got Supergiant.

00:47.251 --> 00:48.794
The name seems inaccurate.

00:48.819 --> 00:50.750
Trust me.
She's dangerous.

00:50.775 --> 00:53.791
Let me go,
Nova Corps scum!

00:54.072 --> 00:56.170
Don't just stand
there, corpsmen.

00:56.195 --> 00:59.108
Give us a hand, stat!
- Titus!

00:59.539 --> 01:00.371
Great.

01:00.396 --> 01:03.044
Just when we get that whack-job
space cop off our tails,

01:03.091 --> 01:04.956
we waltz right
into his front door.

01:05.310 --> 01:07.699
Actually, he's exactly
what I need.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.668
Just act natural
and play along.

01:13.678 --> 01:17.242
You, activate the force field.
- Uh...

01:17.244 --> 01:20.261
What's the holdup?
Enter the code!

01:22.582 --> 01:25.002
Dude, sorry.
I forgot your name.

01:25.205 --> 01:26.610
Corpsman
Titus.

01:26.754 --> 01:27.987
Right. My bad.

01:28.043 --> 01:29.521
Anyway, you got to
forgive my partner,

01:29.523 --> 01:31.790
but he hasn't been firin'
on all cylinders since,

01:31.792 --> 01:34.093
you know,
"The accident."

01:34.298 --> 01:35.548
I suffered no such...

01:39.697 --> 01:41.533
Are you trying
to get us locked up?

01:41.535 --> 01:44.703
I cannot lie.
It is dishonorable.

01:45.003 --> 01:46.953
It's called acting.

01:47.074 --> 01:48.907
You mean like
a performance?

01:48.909 --> 01:50.976
When I competed in
the Galactic Combat Arena,

01:50.978 --> 01:54.213
I used to play the role of a
bloodthirsty, relentless barbarian.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.834
Used to?

01:56.951 --> 02:01.083
Exactly. Look, it's not
a lie if you believe it.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.988
Just keep telling yourself,
"I am Nova Corps."

02:04.013 --> 02:06.037
"We are all Nova Corps."

02:08.895 --> 02:10.543
Yo, Quill. Bad news.

02:10.604 --> 02:12.853
Vault's protected
by voiceprint ID.

02:13.027 --> 02:14.066
Not a problem.

02:16.669 --> 02:18.470
<i>Corpsman Titus.</i>

02:23.108 --> 02:26.429
Recorded him with my helmet. I told
you he was exactly what I need.

02:33.043 --> 02:36.832
I am Nova Corps.
We are all Nova Corps.

02:36.957 --> 02:38.857
What the...
- Mmm-mmm.

02:40.460 --> 02:42.361
I found the locker
number you gave me,

02:42.363 --> 02:44.582
but it's secured
by a force field.

02:44.698 --> 02:47.099
Disabling it... Now!

02:47.101 --> 02:49.334
<i>Holding cells deactivated.</i>

02:49.336 --> 02:51.036
I am Groot.

02:51.038 --> 02:53.839
Oh, like you never turned off
the wrong thing in your life.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:03.264 --> 03:04.410
Ahhh!

03:05.653 --> 03:07.433
What did you do this time?

03:07.731 --> 03:09.431
Super. Giant.

03:09.456 --> 03:11.263
Now, the name makes sense.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.743
Supergiant!
It's me, Star-Lord.

03:34.997 --> 03:38.567
Let me guess. Your last
interaction did not end well.

03:41.394 --> 03:44.039
Okay, listen. I know
I should have called,

03:44.064 --> 03:46.946
but what do you say we talk
about this like civilized...

03:47.479 --> 03:48.637
I taste blood.

03:49.004 --> 03:52.457
I don't talk
to Nova Corps scum!

03:53.637 --> 03:55.180
What? No.

03:55.697 --> 03:56.567
You got it all wrong.

03:57.351 --> 03:58.765
I don't work for them.

03:59.073 --> 04:02.351
I am Nova Corps. We are all Nova Corps.
- No, no, no. No, no, no, no!

04:02.511 --> 04:02.927
Huh?

04:04.964 --> 04:08.213
<i>Rocket...
-</i> I know, I know! I'm working on it!

04:08.215 --> 04:11.600
Ya ain't gonna shut it down by
shushing it, twig-for-brains!

04:15.555 --> 04:17.247
Don't look so smug.

04:17.391 --> 04:18.619
I'm in.

04:19.526 --> 04:21.291
What are
you doing, corpsman?

04:21.572 --> 04:24.375
This area is for
authorized personnel only!

04:24.612 --> 04:27.256
Lucky for me,
I am authorized.

04:27.301 --> 04:29.861
Under whose orders?

04:43.984 --> 04:45.594
Wanna dance, tiny?

04:46.287 --> 04:49.130
Let's dance.
- I am Groot!

04:53.785 --> 04:54.697
Don't look.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.362
You're welcome.

05:19.464 --> 05:23.785
Quill, what is it with your ex-girlfriends?
- Beats me.

05:23.824 --> 05:27.023
I hate to break this to you,
Romeo, but she just did.

05:27.194 --> 05:29.589
We done here?
- Good to go.

05:30.164 --> 05:32.497
Just so you know,
"technically",

05:32.499 --> 05:34.499
she broke up with me.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.201
Shocking.

05:46.112 --> 05:47.679
Quill.

05:58.958 --> 06:01.693
<i>Patrol Ship 619,
this is Tower Control.</i>

06:01.695 --> 06:03.528
<i>We do not have you
cleared for takeoff.</i>

06:03.530 --> 06:07.899
Uh, Tower, in case you haven't noticed,
there's been a major security breach.

06:07.901 --> 06:12.070
Corpsman Titus has ordered us to conduct
an aerial search for the intruders.

06:12.794 --> 06:14.588
Six-one-niner out.

06:28.990 --> 06:30.788
I am Groot.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.586
Hey, I warned you
a zillion times, pal.

06:33.628 --> 06:36.595
Stick a branch where it don't
belong, you're gonna get the claws.

06:37.810 --> 06:39.046
Aw, great.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.563
Now, I can't get the stupid
cloaking field to turn off!

06:41.869 --> 06:44.269
Really? 'Cause you didn't
have any trouble turning off

06:44.271 --> 06:46.614
the holding cell
force fields back there.

06:46.651 --> 06:50.203
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Like I'm the
only one who screwed up.

06:50.444 --> 06:51.681
He is correct.

06:51.706 --> 06:54.849
Your history with the size-shifting
female did not help matters.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.282
Everything was under control
until you pulled that

06:57.284 --> 06:59.628
"We are all Nova Corps"
routine.

06:59.743 --> 07:02.254
I was only doing
what you advised...

07:02.256 --> 07:04.183
Believing the lie
to be true.

07:04.391 --> 07:06.525
It's called acting.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.755
You turn it on,
you turn it off.

07:08.962 --> 07:12.184
I'm not equipped with such a switch.
- Enough!

07:12.399 --> 07:15.666
We've got what we came for.
That's all that matters.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.313
This is the last one,
people.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.796
We finally have a complete
map to the Cosmic Seed.

07:20.842 --> 07:21.620
And just maybe...

07:21.645 --> 07:23.909
<i>Nova Corps Control
to Patrol Ship 619.</i>

07:23.911 --> 07:27.546
<i>We've received a mayday call from a
civilian airship going down in your sector.</i>

07:27.548 --> 07:29.858
<i>Immediate assistance
is required.</i>

07:29.950 --> 07:31.865
Seriously? I'm trying
to have a moment here.

07:32.052 --> 07:35.587
We're still showing up on radar
as a Nova Corps patrol ship.

07:37.057 --> 07:38.955
<i>Patrol Ship, do you read?</i>

07:41.327 --> 07:44.768
Okay, look. It's not our problem.
Nova Corps will handle it.

07:45.632 --> 07:49.568
I am Nova Corps!
We are all Nova Corps!

07:51.009 --> 07:52.170
Stop!
- No, no, no, no!

07:52.172 --> 07:53.239
Drax!

08:07.588 --> 08:11.702
Hey, genius, maybe you can survive
the fall, but your cargo can't.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.533
And you forgot
Mom and Dad.

08:25.743 --> 08:26.789
Ow!

08:28.508 --> 08:31.510
I am Groot!

08:33.179 --> 08:35.616
Root up, bud!
We're workin' on it!

08:35.883 --> 08:38.683
Retro rockets on full!

09:01.340 --> 09:02.807
I am Nova Corps.

09:02.809 --> 09:05.268
We are all Nova Corps.

09:06.145 --> 09:08.947
Seriously, if you say
that one more time...

09:09.182 --> 09:12.048
You know, I thought I knew
everyone in the corps.

09:13.052 --> 09:14.886
Don't.
I'll handle this.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.846
How many times have I
heard that before?

09:18.258 --> 09:19.428
Greetings.

09:19.453 --> 09:22.665
We are exchange recruits
from a distant galaxy.

09:23.663 --> 09:26.658
Well, finally got that
stinkin' cloak to turn off.

09:26.833 --> 09:27.899
You're welcome.

09:28.208 --> 09:31.363
And you are busted.

09:31.605 --> 09:32.235
Huh?

09:38.878 --> 09:40.712
Hey, hey, hey.
Easy with that.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.547
You break it,
I break you.

09:42.716 --> 09:46.304
You sure you want to threaten me
after that stunt you pulled today?

09:46.453 --> 09:49.554
You mean the stunt that
saved innocent lives?

09:49.556 --> 09:52.891
You know, the way I see it, you should
be giving us a medal for that rescue.

09:52.893 --> 09:56.459
An official commendation
would look good on my record.

09:56.530 --> 10:00.124
Dude, how many times I gotta tell you?
You're not Nova Corps!

10:00.163 --> 10:03.888
Which means I got you on breaking and
entering and impersonating officers.

10:03.987 --> 10:07.490
So you can kiss your expunged
criminal records goodbye.

10:07.908 --> 10:10.976
Unless, that is,
we can work out a deal.

10:12.411 --> 10:13.718
I'm listening.

10:14.381 --> 10:17.549
I need you to infiltrate
a gang called the Black Order.

10:17.574 --> 10:20.942
Your friend Supergiant's a member,
so that ought to give you an "in."

10:20.965 --> 10:24.924
Right. Because she seemed so
happy to see him last time?

10:25.153 --> 10:27.497
The Order is trying to unload
an extremely powerful

10:27.536 --> 10:29.694
and dangerous weapon
on the black market.

10:29.896 --> 10:32.537
Nova Corps needs to know
where it is and seize it

10:32.584 --> 10:34.600
before it falls into
the wrong hands.

10:34.601 --> 10:38.546
If it's such a big honkin' deal,
why not send your own goon... Guy!

10:38.571 --> 10:43.183
Because the Black Order would sniff
out real Nova Corps in a heartbeat.

10:44.398 --> 10:45.944
But, hey, it's your call.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.666
I mean, what's a few years
in Kyln prison?

10:48.782 --> 10:53.696
I'm sure you got loads of "friends" there
who'll be only too happy to see you.

10:59.458 --> 11:01.694
Fine. You got a deal.

11:09.333 --> 11:10.602
Uh-uh-uh.

11:10.604 --> 11:13.240
You get your toys back
after the mission.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.300
This'll track
your position.

11:15.325 --> 11:17.717
Just signal me when you got
a line on the goods.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.446
So where do we start?

11:22.683 --> 11:25.203
In a very bad place.

11:32.626 --> 11:36.061
Don't forget. We're going
undercover as criminals this time.

11:36.063 --> 11:38.568
This is a disgrace
to my family name.

11:38.665 --> 11:41.066
It's just another
"performance."

11:41.068 --> 11:43.556
And if we pull it off,
you'll be doing good.

11:43.704 --> 11:46.504
Just remember...
You hate Nova Corps.

11:46.506 --> 11:49.641
We all hate Nova Corps.

11:54.287 --> 11:55.784
And stay out!

11:56.717 --> 11:58.818
Take a load off.
I'm going solo.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.655
The Black Order,
am I right?

12:03.657 --> 12:06.226
Of course, you probably
already know who I am.

12:07.093 --> 12:08.731
Name's Star-Lord.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.715
Who?

12:12.312 --> 12:13.598
Never gets old.

12:13.623 --> 12:16.491
Let's cut to the
chase, shall we?

12:17.193 --> 12:20.177
'Cause I got a little business
proposition that's right up your alley.

12:21.443 --> 12:24.318
You want to hand me
your weapon.

12:28.848 --> 12:30.782
Uh, that part of the plan?

12:30.784 --> 12:33.026
Is there ever a plan?

12:33.186 --> 12:34.385
How'd you do that?

12:34.637 --> 12:39.124
It's a gift. The power to
persuade the weak-minded.

12:39.149 --> 12:42.709
Hey!
- There is something you wish to confess.

12:42.896 --> 12:45.865
Shya, like I'm gonna tell
you that I'm secretly

12:45.896 --> 12:47.521
working undercover
for Nova Corps.

12:48.584 --> 12:49.656
Oh, come on!

12:50.522 --> 12:51.661
And?

12:58.322 --> 13:01.353
Your head is next.

13:01.681 --> 13:03.017
Not yet.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.363
He could prove
to be of value.

13:05.752 --> 13:08.555
Hmm, seems
highly unlikely.

13:11.891 --> 13:14.392
More double agents?

13:14.394 --> 13:16.928
Nice try, but I was
trained by Thanos

13:16.930 --> 13:19.597
to resist stronger
mind control than yours.

13:19.599 --> 13:22.066
And I got
my own methodology.

13:22.068 --> 13:24.836
The sustained rate of fire
for the Mark III Proton Cannon

13:24.838 --> 13:27.619
is 4.6 discharges
per second!

13:27.808 --> 13:29.574
I am Groot.

13:29.576 --> 13:33.382
Surely you have
something to confess.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.914
I hate Nova Corps.

13:35.939 --> 13:38.402
We all hate Nova Corps!

13:42.872 --> 13:45.622
I'm acting.
Make your pain convincing.

13:46.668 --> 13:49.098
Too convincing. Too convincing!

13:53.332 --> 13:57.135
You will tell me
who they are.

14:02.374 --> 14:06.544
Supergiant was right. You
guys got some real trust issues.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.646
What do you know
of Supergiant?

14:08.648 --> 14:12.283
Sweet kid. Met her in lockup
right before we got released.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.552
Word on the cellblock was
Nova Corps was planning

14:14.554 --> 14:16.654
to use an informant to
infiltrate your gangs,

14:16.656 --> 14:18.790
so she asked us
to warn you.

14:18.792 --> 14:21.993
And deliver a message about
moving a certain package,

14:21.995 --> 14:24.729
which you might
want to do pronto.

14:24.731 --> 14:26.564
'Cause that beacon
may be toast,

14:26.566 --> 14:28.985
but I'm bettin' they already
got your position.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.998
Your assistance is
greatly appreciated.

14:37.646 --> 14:40.247
Assistance? We're breakin'
our tails here.

14:40.782 --> 14:44.014
Oh, this crystal better
have been worth it, Quill.

14:47.432 --> 14:48.419
Come on, Mom.

14:49.112 --> 14:51.231
Just five minutes more.

14:53.765 --> 14:56.905
No.
Get out of my head!

14:56.930 --> 14:58.744
We're all
working for Nova Corps!

14:58.899 --> 15:01.940
Yeah, I get it, okay?
Weak-minded!

15:14.013 --> 15:16.381
I busted my hump
for a stinkin' hammer?

15:16.383 --> 15:18.416
That's not just
any hammer.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.812
It is Ronan the Accuser's
universal weapon.

15:22.121 --> 15:23.485
All right.

15:23.510 --> 15:26.244
Pretty much all that was left of
Ronan after we got through with him.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.293
Thanos is
awaiting delivery.

15:29.814 --> 15:32.130
We must go. Now.

15:32.155 --> 15:34.687
But there is
one last thing...

15:34.720 --> 15:36.411
Your demise.

15:40.472 --> 15:43.057
Sorry, guys.
I couldn't help it.

15:43.243 --> 15:46.744
Come on! You're not seriously gonna
take that idiot's word over ours?

15:46.746 --> 15:49.480
His brain's hardly
a reliable source.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.382
We all hate Nova Corps.

16:04.127 --> 16:06.431
Now is the time to
make yourself useful.

16:06.433 --> 16:07.665
Attack them!

16:12.781 --> 16:14.772
Resist the mind control.

16:14.774 --> 16:17.021
I do not want to harm you!

16:17.237 --> 16:18.945
So don't!

16:45.760 --> 16:47.011
Finish him!

16:50.409 --> 16:53.886
You will pull the trigger.
You cannot resist.

16:53.955 --> 16:54.909
Do it.

16:59.893 --> 17:02.621
This kind of acting
is unacceptable, Quill!

17:04.890 --> 17:06.633
I am Groot!

17:16.367 --> 17:19.237
Took you long enough.
Instead of arresting them,

17:19.239 --> 17:21.906
I say you blast
these flargs to bits!

17:21.907 --> 17:24.075
Or I could annihilate
every one of you

17:24.077 --> 17:26.513
and keep the universal
weapon for myself.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.984
So this whole thing
was a setup.

17:29.018 --> 17:32.040
Took you lowlifes long
enough to figure it out.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.514
I am Groot.

17:34.655 --> 17:36.754
Now, don't jump
to conclusions.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.689
Titus ain't a bad cop.

17:38.691 --> 17:41.570
He's a lyin',
thievin' corrupt cop!

17:41.661 --> 17:44.929
I take it back.
You're worse than lowlifes.

17:44.931 --> 17:47.432
You're lowlifes
who want to be heroes.

17:47.434 --> 17:50.601
That's why it was so easy
to make you do my dirty work.

17:50.603 --> 17:54.172
I just had to keep playing "tough
cop" to make it convincing.

17:54.174 --> 17:57.752
Only I'm through playing.

18:14.359 --> 18:17.562
When I'm done here,
I am gonna hurt you.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.862
I would expect no less.

18:29.236 --> 18:32.406
I'd thank ya, but then I'd
have to look at ya. Ew!

18:36.281 --> 18:38.201
Yo!
Grim Reaper!

18:38.412 --> 18:40.145
What say we keep
Kitty distracted

18:40.170 --> 18:42.217
whilst Wrinkles
puts the whammy on him?

18:46.292 --> 18:49.184
You will give me
the universal weapon.

19:03.619 --> 19:05.120
You are Nova Corps.

19:05.325 --> 19:07.645
This is an insult
to your oath.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.850
Just words
and a uniform.

19:09.949 --> 19:13.451
I joined Nova Corps to make
some units on the black market.

19:13.453 --> 19:16.272
The Collector's gonna
pay me a fortune for this.

19:16.610 --> 19:18.655
And you think
we're lowlifes?

19:20.470 --> 19:23.754
<i>I joined Nova Corps
to make some units on the black market.</i>

19:24.136 --> 19:26.727
That's right, pal.
I was just playin' possum.

19:27.089 --> 19:29.100
How do you like me now,
control freak?

19:29.102 --> 19:32.865
I got him to give all that up
with my weak little mind.

19:33.945 --> 19:36.479
Clever. Too bad you
won't live long enough

19:36.504 --> 19:38.700
for anyone at Nova Corps
to hear it.

19:38.978 --> 19:41.712
Did I mention this baby
doesn't just record?

19:41.714 --> 19:43.548
It broadcasts, too.

19:43.550 --> 19:46.184
Meaning, your bosses back
at HQ have already got it

19:46.186 --> 19:48.872
and are probably on their
way here right now.

19:52.792 --> 19:55.162
Come on.
That the best you got?

19:57.485 --> 20:00.482
You may be the Hammer-Man, but
you still can't touch this.

20:02.922 --> 20:03.821
Whoa!

20:12.722 --> 20:15.438
I am Drax the Destroyer!

20:18.083 --> 20:20.121
Good idea. Stick
with what you know.

20:23.160 --> 20:25.487
All that playacting,
and what do we get?

20:25.511 --> 20:27.835
Our own stuff
back from Titus.

20:27.860 --> 20:31.006
Oh, and the one lousy crystal
that started the whole mess.

20:31.195 --> 20:34.498
Well, seeing as how we don't know
who we can trust in Nova Corps,

20:34.523 --> 20:36.100
who will be here
any second,

20:36.102 --> 20:38.786
we should add one universal
weapon to our haul.

20:41.397 --> 20:43.174
You will regret this, Quill!

20:43.176 --> 20:44.317
Get your hands...

20:58.023 --> 21:01.360
Now, as I was saying before
we were so rudely interrupted...

21:01.561 --> 21:05.429
We finally have a complete map to
the Cosmic Seed, and just maybe...

21:05.665 --> 21:07.777
The key to saving
the entire universe.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.767
Have to say, Quill,
it was impressive

21:09.769 --> 21:13.204
how you beat that mind control
just in time to nail Titus.

21:13.206 --> 21:15.306
Nah. I kicked it
way before that.

21:15.308 --> 21:17.642
How much before?

21:17.644 --> 21:21.305
Surely it was after
you fired upon me.

21:21.319 --> 21:23.898
Nope. That was all me.
It's called acting.

21:24.053 --> 21:25.007
And payback.

21:25.303 --> 21:27.360
Quill!

21:28.547 --> 21:30.437
You're just acting now,
right, Drax?

21:30.781 --> 21:33.067
Drax? Drax!

21:33.092 --> 21:35.995
<i>Okay, help!
And scene!</i>
