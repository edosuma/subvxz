WEBVTT

02:16.261 --> 02:17.678
-Dad!
-Dad!

03:09.189 --> 03:11.982
Oh, my God! Nora, you just hit me.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.528
Don't take sides, Juanito.
I'm the one who thinks you're cute.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.489
lt'll live. lt's just a car, not a baby.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.617
Nora, you don't hit a new bimmer.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.076
Mary, it'll be fine.

03:23.494 --> 03:26.580
Pablo, that topiary looks just like Dad.

03:28.416 --> 03:29.583
This one's for you, Juanito,

03:29.626 --> 03:31.460
-and can you get the case out of the trunk?
-Yes.

03:31.502 --> 03:32.961
-Nora?
-What?

03:35.924 --> 03:38.967
What is this, Tijuana? Oh, my gosh.

03:55.151 --> 03:57.653
-Oh, my gosh, you are so slow.
-You're gonna make me drop the cake.

03:58.112 --> 03:59.988
lt's heavy, okay?

04:00.031 --> 04:02.157
You, niña, keep away from my stove.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.327
-Do you need any help?
-lt's not even done yet.

04:08.915 --> 04:12.501
Oh, my God, that is really thick stew.

04:15.505 --> 04:17.755
For your father's birthday.

04:17.839 --> 04:20.341
They say it brings a bride.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.679
Well, in that case, Carmina,
you can just throw it all out.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.347
Will you lighten up, please?

04:25.848 --> 04:26.974
Nora!

04:27.684 --> 04:31.353
Mary, when we're gone,
who will he have left?

04:31.437 --> 04:33.105
Well, Mom.

04:33.189 --> 04:36.149
Well, she's not very talkative now, is she?

04:36.192 --> 04:39.486
Well, she's beautiful, and she'll never age.

04:39.529 --> 04:42.072
Beauty is not everything.

04:42.156 --> 04:46.034
Okay, how would you know? You're 24,
and you seriously have not been kissed.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.619
-Okay, thanks a lot.
-You're, like, Amish.

04:47.704 --> 04:48.954
-Really? Amish?
-Girls!

04:50.623 --> 04:54.751
Girls, are you fighting? On my birthday?

04:54.836 --> 04:56.295
-Dad...
-l hope it is important.

04:56.379 --> 04:57.671
She crashed my car.

04:57.714 --> 04:58.797
-She did?
-Yes!

04:58.881 --> 05:02.217
lt'll cost you less than one
of your shopping sprees on Rodeo Drive.

05:02.260 --> 05:05.929
You should go with your sister
on a spree one of these days, you know?

05:06.014 --> 05:07.389
-See?
-See?

05:07.432 --> 05:08.473
-Dad.
-What?

05:08.558 --> 05:09.891
You know what?
There are more important things to do

05:09.934 --> 05:12.728
-than going shopping with her.
-Like giving me a kiss for my birthday.

05:12.770 --> 05:14.688
-Come on. Okay. Like dancing.
-Happy birthday.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.107
-Like, one, two, three. One, two, three.
-Dad...

05:17.191 --> 05:19.943
You can't dance to tacky ranchero music.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.278
-Why not?
-Rancheros are not tacky.

05:21.362 --> 05:22.946
-Yes, it is.
-lt's not.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.935
A perfect funeral for him.
Even the mariachis are drunk.

06:40.274 --> 06:42.484
Okay. lt's not a criticism.

06:45.780 --> 06:46.822
l can say that.

06:47.698 --> 06:49.199
We are family, no?

06:50.618 --> 06:52.494
And that's what counts.

06:56.457 --> 06:57.666
Aurelia.

07:05.591 --> 07:07.050
Who are they?

07:08.845 --> 07:10.303
Do you know them?

07:13.516 --> 07:15.016
He is your brother.

07:17.228 --> 07:19.855
-We have a brother?
-We have a brother?

07:20.940 --> 07:23.191
His name is Gabe, Jr.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.694
-That's impossible.
-How?

07:25.945 --> 07:29.030
Your father had an affair
before you were born.

07:29.657 --> 07:32.033
Your mother forgave him.

07:54.223 --> 07:55.390
But he's illegitimate.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.559
Mary!

07:57.602 --> 07:58.894
l'm sorry, l just meant...

07:58.978 --> 08:00.228
You don't need to be sorry.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.148
Yes, she does.
And we know what you meant.

08:03.232 --> 08:06.109
But the will says we get a third of his assets.

08:07.111 --> 08:09.070
-"We"?
-Ladies, please.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.698
The will is meaningless.

08:13.075 --> 08:14.910
He didn't want you to know,

08:14.952 --> 08:18.163
but Mr. Dominguez was in bankruptcy.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.373
Bankrupt?

08:20.416 --> 08:21.958
No way.

08:22.043 --> 08:25.337
Listen, your father was a wonderful man,

08:25.796 --> 08:27.130
but a risk-taker.

08:29.383 --> 08:31.843
He wasn't prepared for the economic crisis.

08:32.761 --> 08:36.014
Okay, so what do we have?

08:38.601 --> 08:40.602
A huge amount of debt.

08:41.812 --> 08:42.812
Well, what about the house?

08:43.105 --> 08:44.523
-Let us buy it.
-No.

08:44.607 --> 08:45.941
lt's not for sale.

08:52.573 --> 08:55.116
Look, this could benefit us all.

08:55.868 --> 08:58.161
We actually re-sell homes for a living.

08:58.621 --> 09:01.039
And you can stay in the house with us,
if you want to.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.167
Until you're ready to go.

09:45.209 --> 09:46.835
Oh, no! Not the playhouse!

09:50.756 --> 09:52.340
l bet that's Mary.

09:53.718 --> 09:56.469
lf you stopped smoking pot,
you wouldn't be...

09:56.512 --> 09:59.347
You do know that possession of marijuana
is illegal?

10:00.016 --> 10:01.641
lt's a silly law.

10:02.310 --> 10:03.351
Oh?

10:03.436 --> 10:07.814
Legalize cannabis and tax it,
create a revenue stream for the state.

10:08.399 --> 10:11.109
Conservatives have created
a formidable opposition to it.

10:11.193 --> 10:13.987
Well, someone has to keep us in the dark.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.782
Sorry, l thought you were my sister.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.869
Do l look like your sister?

10:21.203 --> 10:22.203
No.

10:22.788 --> 10:25.040
You're taller, and on time.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.377
l'm Edward, Olivia's brother.

10:30.171 --> 10:33.214
Nora, newly discovered sister-in-law

10:33.716 --> 10:35.342
and law student.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.385
Nice to meet you.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.179
Edward?

10:39.680 --> 10:41.556
-Oh, my God! Look at you.
-Hi.

10:41.599 --> 10:45.602
Olivia, don't infantilize me
in front of this beautiful woman.

10:45.686 --> 10:48.647
Have you met my brother,
the ruthless attorney?

10:48.731 --> 10:51.483
Yes, he looks like he could shred things.

10:51.567 --> 10:53.026
Excuse me.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.450
Does it really look like him?

11:00.534 --> 11:02.202
You never met him?

11:05.164 --> 11:06.915
Did you ever try to?

11:08.250 --> 11:10.669
My mother told me he abandoned us.

11:12.421 --> 11:14.130
That's strange.

11:15.883 --> 11:18.593
l mean, family was so important to him.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.184
Okay.

11:27.144 --> 11:28.687
So, you're poor.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.731
No more shopping.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.442
l'd kill myself.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.486
No high-protein diet.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.239
Poor people only eat carbs.

11:39.824 --> 11:40.907
Wow.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.035
What time is it?

11:46.622 --> 11:47.831
1 2:05.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.292
Shit, l'm late.

11:59.093 --> 12:03.638
Sorry that l'm late. This smells so good.

12:04.807 --> 12:08.351
Your lips are way red.

12:10.229 --> 12:13.440
Hi.

12:13.482 --> 12:15.900
l'm Edward, her brother.

12:18.320 --> 12:22.240
How is that possible?
'Cause, like, you look so nice,

12:22.324 --> 12:24.200
and you're, like, so...

12:28.247 --> 12:33.668
Got it. Well, it was very nice meeting you.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.004
Nice to meet you, too.

12:36.046 --> 12:37.589
Edward is staying the night with us.

12:37.673 --> 12:39.591
Your room has the best view
of the mountains,

12:39.675 --> 12:41.634
so he's going to use it.

12:42.178 --> 12:45.680
Really? Well, there's not really
that much room in my bed,

12:45.765 --> 12:47.474
but l think we can make it work.

12:49.852 --> 12:53.480
After lunch, could you and your sister
please pack your things?

12:53.522 --> 12:54.647
You're joking, right?

12:54.940 --> 12:56.691
No, not at all.

12:56.734 --> 12:59.068
l've been planning on moving you both
to the basement anyway.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.528
l need to re-do those rooms, and...

13:00.613 --> 13:01.654
Wait, what?

13:02.198 --> 13:04.157
l'm not going to the basement
of my own house.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.200
Former house.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.409
-Olivia.
-Gabe.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.703
l have been patient enough.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.206
We have the house, but we cannot
keep the orphans that came with it.

13:11.248 --> 13:12.248
Olivia, please.

13:12.333 --> 13:13.541
Let's discuss this in private.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.418
l'm not going anywhere.

13:15.711 --> 13:16.795
Why not?

13:16.879 --> 13:19.047
l mean,
who wants to be humiliated like this?

13:21.425 --> 13:22.634
Let's go.

13:22.718 --> 13:23.885
But...

13:24.261 --> 13:25.345
l mean, we...

13:25.387 --> 13:26.805
There's so much stuff.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.264
We're gonna need, like, a truck.

13:28.849 --> 13:31.893
Don't bother.
Everything in this house stays. We own it.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.478
That is correct.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.147
And l suggest you sell it,

13:36.232 --> 13:38.983
and see if you can buy yourself some class.

13:40.945 --> 13:43.029
-Mary, let's go. Right now.
-But... But...

13:43.072 --> 13:44.989
How is everything hers?

13:47.076 --> 13:49.160
Nora, what are we gonna do?

13:49.245 --> 13:52.497
Move out now. Come on.
At least the bimmer's in your name.

13:52.581 --> 13:54.290
She can't stop us from taking that.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.708
Okay, then after that?

13:55.751 --> 13:57.252
l have a plan.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.763
Bye, Carmina. l'll miss you.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.558
-See you later.
-Take care.

14:15.896 --> 14:17.772
This was your father's.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.235
Thank you. Thank you.

14:57.187 --> 14:59.355
So, where are we going?

14:59.857 --> 15:01.774
East LA.

15:01.817 --> 15:03.067
East LA?

15:19.293 --> 15:23.171
l am really scared right now, Nora.
Like, we're gonna get shot.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.465
Would you just calm down?

15:25.507 --> 15:27.717
This place is perfectly safe.

15:40.230 --> 15:42.231
Welcome to the barrio, mija.

15:42.524 --> 15:44.400
-Drive. Just drive.
-Oh, my gosh.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.529
Hey, it's fine. Just calm down. Just drive.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.298
Oh, my God.

16:08.592 --> 16:09.801
Really?

16:10.552 --> 16:11.678
What?

16:14.974 --> 16:16.474
Nora, l can't.

16:16.558 --> 16:18.851
Come on, look how happy she is.

16:19.269 --> 16:20.937
She looks like the warden at a jail,

16:21.021 --> 16:22.522
and we're the new meat.

16:22.898 --> 16:26.067
Seriously, l will just go
and move in with Carrie, okay?

16:26.110 --> 16:27.193
Her parents will adopt me.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.736
You'd leave me here alone?

16:28.779 --> 16:31.739
Well, no. l would visit you on Sundays.

16:31.865 --> 16:33.950
Okay, you know what?
You're going nowhere without me, all right?

16:34.410 --> 16:36.828
l am taking the keys, all right?

16:37.162 --> 16:38.913
Seriously, it's not funny.

16:38.956 --> 16:40.498
-Nora!
-You need to come right now.

16:40.582 --> 16:42.208
-Nora...
-Stop being so immature.

16:42.251 --> 16:43.418
Nora!

16:43.502 --> 16:45.461
-Don't leave me.
-Come on.

16:45.629 --> 16:47.296
What do you think?

16:48.048 --> 16:51.843
Fifteen minutes,
and you are on the other side of the border.

16:53.387 --> 16:54.762
My God.

16:56.890 --> 16:58.307
Hasn't changed in 1 0 years, no?

16:59.143 --> 17:00.810
l can't thank you enough.

17:00.894 --> 17:02.270
No, no, no, no, no.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.990
Sorry, l don't...

17:14.241 --> 17:16.159
They don't speak Spanish.

17:17.786 --> 17:19.787
ls she planning living in there, o qué?

17:35.304 --> 17:36.888
That's my stuff.

18:04.208 --> 18:05.833
Yo, yo, relax.

18:06.376 --> 18:07.668
l ain't the barrio killer.

18:08.295 --> 18:09.921
Are you homeless?

18:10.297 --> 18:12.840
No. Are you?

18:16.303 --> 18:17.970
Shit, l need mace.

18:20.682 --> 18:21.724
Look who's here.

18:24.520 --> 18:27.021
There is a gang member on your lawn.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.982
No, mija, that's Bruno, my neighbor.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.236
Okay, well, he's creepy.

18:33.695 --> 18:36.531
Not everything that stinks is caca, mijita.

18:47.584 --> 18:50.044
-Go home. Okay?
-Hurry up, before they charge you. Go.

18:53.465 --> 18:55.299
-She is Nora.
-Hi.

18:56.301 --> 18:58.886
Yo, you're good.
We got your back out here, all right?

18:58.971 --> 19:00.054
All right.

19:00.139 --> 19:03.307
And the other one with no smile is la Mary.

19:06.937 --> 19:08.896
Nice to meet you, Mary.

19:09.523 --> 19:12.024
lt's Mary. And l'm not tipping you.

19:12.651 --> 19:15.278
That's good, 'cause l don't take lOUs.

19:22.744 --> 19:25.079
Go ahead, go ahead. Sit down.

19:26.081 --> 19:29.542
We have wonderful and delicious
churros y chocolates.

19:32.921 --> 19:38.301
This neighborhood used to be Jewish,
then Japanese, then Mexican.

19:39.386 --> 19:41.262
lt's totally Calcutta.

19:42.973 --> 19:46.434
Except it's less hot, and there's a breeze.

19:47.227 --> 19:50.104
-We gotta get out of here.
-And go where?

19:50.939 --> 19:52.398
Four Seasons.

19:54.067 --> 19:56.777
You know what?
There's lice on that mattress.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.946
Then you won't sleep alone.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.658
Why don't you get ready for bed?

20:09.917 --> 20:11.542
Nora, l miss Dad.

20:17.966 --> 20:19.133
Me, too.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.262
That stupid mustache.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.016
lt wasn't even original.

20:27.476 --> 20:30.186
lt was that Pedro guy.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.271
lnfante.

20:32.856 --> 20:34.649
Yeah, Pedro lnfante.

20:37.110 --> 20:40.029
But Mom looked more
like that Dolores River lady.

20:40.113 --> 20:42.198
-River lady?
-l don't know her name.

20:43.283 --> 20:45.660
lt was del Rio or something.

20:46.286 --> 20:48.120
Yeah. You know what?

20:49.539 --> 20:53.000
She would have looked like
anything Dad wanted her to.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.546
l really miss him, Nora.

21:06.139 --> 21:08.391
-l'm sorry.
-Don't say "sorry."

21:09.309 --> 21:11.310
Don't say "sorry."

21:11.353 --> 21:12.603
What are we gonna do?

21:12.688 --> 21:15.606
We're gonna be okay.
l'm gonna figure it out.

21:18.568 --> 21:19.986
Oh, my gosh.

23:26.071 --> 23:28.823
lt's not a dream? Shit!

23:31.910 --> 23:33.828
Careful. Last two eggs.

23:53.056 --> 23:56.267
How is it possible
that you don't know the basics?

23:56.810 --> 23:58.227
Do you know how to fly a plane?

23:59.020 --> 24:01.897
Of course not. Why should l?

24:02.023 --> 24:05.693
Right. Well, because you never had to.
l never had to cook.

24:07.237 --> 24:08.362
l'm willing to learn.

24:09.698 --> 24:11.365
Learn to clean.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.243
And then we go out for a little desayuno.

24:15.537 --> 24:16.871
Not downtown, Carrie.

24:17.205 --> 24:19.248
No, it's worse. East LA.

24:19.833 --> 24:21.917
Will you just get a map, please?

24:22.002 --> 24:24.753
Gosh, you'd think we moved
to another country.

24:34.389 --> 24:35.639
Learning Spanish?

24:54.242 --> 24:58.370
This is the neighborhood.
And don't worry, they speak English here.

25:07.797 --> 25:10.549
Nice to meet you. l'm Rosita.

25:11.718 --> 25:13.052
You need some work.

25:13.261 --> 25:15.596
Come on in. l have two-for-one special.

25:17.849 --> 25:19.016
What was that?

25:29.110 --> 25:30.653
What is that?

25:34.282 --> 25:36.992
Ay, mija, you better make friends
a new way, hombre.

25:37.077 --> 25:41.288
What? Just a few minutes at Macy's
makeup counter and they'd be fine.

25:50.757 --> 25:54.301
Excuse me, but do you know
how much fat is in this?

26:02.686 --> 26:03.978
What's the matter with you?

26:06.231 --> 26:07.898
You are just like your mother.

26:08.817 --> 26:10.484
Of course. She was smart.

26:10.569 --> 26:11.777
No, mijita.

26:17.033 --> 26:19.368
And what does she do?

26:19.452 --> 26:21.078
Crash in the car.

26:22.706 --> 26:26.458
Don't worry, tia,
we're going to be responsible. You'll see.

26:27.294 --> 26:30.921
l'm going to get a job at a law firm
and Mary's going to graduate.

26:31.464 --> 26:33.340
You're gonna quit school?

26:33.425 --> 26:35.134
Nora, l'm the one who sucks at school.

26:35.176 --> 26:37.678
l'm going to defer school,
and you need to finish.

26:38.138 --> 26:40.222
-Then, l'll go back.
-Don't worry, Mary.

26:40.307 --> 26:44.184
Nora's not the only one
who's going to have to make sacrifices.

27:26.269 --> 27:28.729
lt will take you to the same places.

27:30.190 --> 27:32.399
Where they will turn me away.

27:56.007 --> 27:57.883
What is he doing here?

28:00.762 --> 28:03.931
Nora? That Edward guy is here.

28:09.437 --> 28:10.479
Hey, yo.

28:11.773 --> 28:14.108
-Yeah?
-You parked the wrong way.

28:16.403 --> 28:17.403
Sorry.

28:35.797 --> 28:36.880
Yes?

28:38.425 --> 28:41.677
Hi. The Dominguez family?

28:41.761 --> 28:44.263
-Are you from police?
-No.

28:44.305 --> 28:46.306
No, no, no. l'm Edward Ferris.

28:46.349 --> 28:48.642
l'm looking for Nora Dominguez.

28:50.478 --> 28:52.646
l will ask her if she's here.

29:03.992 --> 29:05.576
Come in, please.

29:07.662 --> 29:08.996
Thank you.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.040
Wait, please.

29:18.590 --> 29:22.426
ltis time for Dodger baseball.

29:22.844 --> 29:26.513
Live from PETCO Park in San Diego,

29:26.848 --> 29:29.892
Prime Ticket presents the Dodgers

29:29.976 --> 29:32.561
-and the San Diego Padres.
-Hi.

29:33.188 --> 29:34.688
Hi, everybody, and a very pleasant...

29:34.773 --> 29:36.899
-Hi.
-lt's good to see you.

29:39.027 --> 29:40.527
What are you doing here?

29:40.904 --> 29:41.987
Come with me.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.290
That's my dad.

29:57.462 --> 29:58.504
Thank you.

29:58.880 --> 29:59.922
You're welcome.

30:06.888 --> 30:10.849
-That's... Be careful. lt's really heavy.
-Thank you.

30:18.066 --> 30:21.610
-Careful, please. lt's my sister.
-Sorry, sorry. Sorry, sorry.

30:22.195 --> 30:24.404
-l think it's okay.
-Thank you.

30:26.366 --> 30:27.741
No offense,

30:28.785 --> 30:30.994
but why are you doing all of this?

30:31.079 --> 30:33.038
We can do nice things for each other,
can't we?

30:33.081 --> 30:34.581
Well, yeah, but...

30:35.792 --> 30:38.961
Renting a U-Haul
and picking up all of our stuff

30:39.045 --> 30:41.922
and driving it to the ghetto
is a bit much, don't you think?

30:42.257 --> 30:44.591
Don't forget convincing my sister
to give it all back to you.

30:46.928 --> 30:50.264
Well, you just don't really seem
like the kind of guy who does stuff for free.

30:51.307 --> 30:53.600
On a professional level, never.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.729
And what level are we, Edward?

31:10.410 --> 31:14.663
Someone must have been watering
his mustache 'cause it's a lot bigger.

31:15.456 --> 31:19.668
You seem to have adapted well
in such a short period of time.

31:21.129 --> 31:22.713
l'm a cockroach.

31:23.548 --> 31:25.215
Survival skills.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.843
-l adapt.
-Okay.

31:27.927 --> 31:30.304
So, what else do you have to do to survive?

31:30.388 --> 31:32.514
-Find a job.
-You're looking for a job?

31:33.308 --> 31:35.934
There is an opening in our office.

31:35.977 --> 31:37.936
We could stand a cockroach or two.

31:39.314 --> 31:41.273
Thank you.

31:41.316 --> 31:45.861
But you've been nice enough already,
and l will find one by myself.

31:45.945 --> 31:49.281
-Like through the classifieds?
-For example.

32:00.251 --> 32:02.419
Be my guest. And good luck.

32:03.504 --> 32:04.838
Thank you.

32:13.598 --> 32:14.973
"Dentist.

32:15.975 --> 32:17.559
"Dance hostess."

32:19.687 --> 32:22.481
Do you think this is what Mexico looks like?

32:23.900 --> 32:25.275
Here's one.

32:26.653 --> 32:29.488
"Samuels, Birnbaum & Tate."

32:30.949 --> 32:33.867
Corporate law. Perfect. l'll apply tomorrow.

32:35.036 --> 32:37.704
There's something weird
about that Edward guy, don't you think?

32:39.207 --> 32:43.877
Well, he seems nicer than his sister,
and he offered me a job.

32:45.254 --> 32:46.463
He did?

32:47.715 --> 32:49.549
Well, did you accept?

32:50.635 --> 32:54.179
No. l can find a job on my own.

32:54.222 --> 32:56.598
Nora, in the real world,
it's called hitting on you.

32:57.308 --> 32:59.643
And what does that mean, really?

33:00.061 --> 33:01.979
He likes you.

33:02.063 --> 33:05.232
l mean, why else would
he be doing all this stuff?

33:05.900 --> 33:08.235
l'm sorry.
You're not interested in relationships,

33:08.319 --> 33:10.362
only your 1 0-year plan, 'cause you're weird.

33:11.406 --> 33:14.282
Well, whatever you think, l'm not like you.

33:17.120 --> 33:20.580
l can't believe Dad wrote all these letters
and Gabe never got them.

33:21.374 --> 33:22.416
l'm gonna open these and read them.

33:22.625 --> 33:23.917
No, you're not.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.253
-No, no, no, you're not.
-Come on.

33:26.379 --> 33:27.504
No, Mary.

33:27.588 --> 33:29.089
One day, we're gonna give them to Gabe.

33:29.132 --> 33:30.632
Yeah, in our next life.

33:55.575 --> 33:56.825
-Bye.
-Have a good day.

33:56.909 --> 33:57.909
Thank you. You, too.

33:57.952 --> 33:59.286
-Bye.
-Bye.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.913
Oh, God. Look at this car.

34:16.387 --> 34:18.138
Are you serious?

34:18.222 --> 34:20.181
What are you looking for?

34:20.850 --> 34:22.141
Great bargain, tia.

34:22.643 --> 34:23.976
Thank you.

34:25.353 --> 34:26.772
Hey, yo. Yo!

34:26.813 --> 34:28.190
Stop, stop.

34:28.983 --> 34:30.108
Stop.

34:31.694 --> 34:33.904
-You're gonna drown it.
-Okay.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.661
Don't steal anything.

34:41.746 --> 34:43.789
-You think all Mexicans steal?
-l don't know.

34:43.831 --> 34:44.956
l'm not Mexican.

34:44.998 --> 34:47.876
You're not Mexican?
You should take a look at yourself

34:49.003 --> 34:52.714
Because with a poncho and huaraches,
you can make a killing selling tamales.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.550
That's really funny.

34:56.177 --> 34:58.929
-Hey, you know what a distributor is?
-Do l need to?

34:59.972 --> 35:02.224
See, these two cables here,
they come loose.

35:02.308 --> 35:05.352
-Yeah?
-Just make sure that they still connect.

35:05.978 --> 35:08.355
Like your mouth and your brain should.

35:12.068 --> 35:14.986
Thanks. Can you do the garden next?

35:16.489 --> 35:19.533
Right after l finish
cleaning your indoor pool.

35:26.582 --> 35:28.458
Mary, slow down.

35:28.543 --> 35:31.294
You don't wanna be late for work.
Here's your bus.

35:31.379 --> 35:33.755
Don't sit in the back. You will get killed.

35:34.048 --> 35:35.757
By who? A commuter?

35:36.509 --> 35:38.218
Goodbye, Nora.

35:38.302 --> 35:40.345
Goodbye, Mary. Have a good day.

35:41.389 --> 35:42.931
...is right.

35:43.558 --> 35:47.811
We have joined the working class. Lame!

35:56.571 --> 35:57.904
Thank you.

36:00.908 --> 36:02.159
Sorry.

36:12.086 --> 36:15.005
You live in LA and not speak Spanish?

36:21.345 --> 36:22.762
ls she okay?

36:27.435 --> 36:29.019
l fired.

36:29.645 --> 36:31.771
Big boss no pay because of mops.

36:31.814 --> 36:33.648
Because of mops?

36:33.733 --> 36:37.194
l borrow to clean hall for quinceañera.

36:37.695 --> 36:40.030
The quinceañera party, you know?

36:41.532 --> 36:44.326
Then you should have
been given a warning.

36:45.119 --> 36:47.871
l'm a law student, if that helps at all.

36:49.457 --> 36:50.665
Can you help us?

36:51.459 --> 36:52.584
l can try.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.088
Really?

36:58.299 --> 36:59.299
Thank you.

37:16.817 --> 37:19.152
Welcome to Samuels, Birnbaum & Tate.

37:19.195 --> 37:21.488
Hi, l'm Nora Dominguez.

37:23.157 --> 37:24.783
Congratulations.

37:24.825 --> 37:27.661
You made it to the 26th floor quite quickly.

37:28.663 --> 37:30.497
l just used the elevator.

37:31.624 --> 37:32.791
ls that what they call it these days?

37:39.966 --> 37:42.842
He specializes in corporate defense
of product liability.

37:43.344 --> 37:44.803
Your password is "Ferris."

37:44.845 --> 37:46.680
-Ferris?
-Yes, Ferris.

37:46.722 --> 37:47.806
Like Edward, your new boss.

37:48.474 --> 37:50.267
Read the deposition, write a little brief,

37:50.351 --> 37:52.227
tell him about how he's gonna make
a lot of money this year,

37:52.311 --> 37:53.353
you'll do just fine. Got it?

37:53.396 --> 37:55.188
See you in 1 0 years.

38:29.515 --> 38:32.475
Today, a great deal of political turmoil.

38:32.560 --> 38:35.103
How many of you
have read the book l assigned?

38:35.688 --> 38:38.023
-Did you read the book?
-The title page.

38:38.065 --> 38:39.357
Just as l thought.

38:39.400 --> 38:43.778
This is why today,
l brought in my new TA, Rodrigo.

38:43.863 --> 38:46.865
You notice how TAs always
look like star political prisoners?

38:46.907 --> 38:50.285
...La Casa De Bernarda Alba.
Rodrigo, please.

38:57.084 --> 38:59.377
Don't worry, that's all the Spanish l'll speak.

38:59.837 --> 39:01.421
What happened to political prisoner?

39:01.756 --> 39:02.839
"Silence!

39:04.258 --> 39:05.342
"Silence."

39:06.469 --> 39:10.972
Those are the first words you hear
in Garcia Lorca's masterpiece.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.684
-Who is he?
-A story about the consequences of...

39:14.769 --> 39:18.772
l heard his father is an ambassador
to one of those countries with fruit flies.

39:18.856 --> 39:21.649
l trust you have experienced
the electricity of desire.

39:24.111 --> 39:26.946
-Does he have a girlfriend?
-Does it matter?

39:26.989 --> 39:28.073
-No.
-Are you one of those people

39:28.115 --> 39:30.658
who burns with so much passion,

39:31.452 --> 39:33.787
but are not able to express it?

39:34.955 --> 39:37.916
Then you might be able to relate
to this tragedy of a mother

39:38.834 --> 39:40.919
who locks up her five daughters

39:40.961 --> 39:43.588
to mourn their deceased father
for eight years.

39:44.340 --> 39:48.259
Can you imagine losing a father
and mourning him for that long?

39:48.302 --> 39:50.303
-Yes.
-What?

39:50.388 --> 39:53.598
Now, imagine a free spirit

39:55.434 --> 39:58.978
burning in desire for a man,
Pepe el Romano,

40:00.398 --> 40:03.316
who climbs through your window
each night,

40:03.401 --> 40:05.193
but cannot belong to you.

40:05.277 --> 40:09.656
And when he calls to you in the distance,
he sings your very name.

40:10.991 --> 40:14.160
Adela!

40:14.912 --> 40:18.415
Mary.

40:20.126 --> 40:22.794
And do you know how she responds?

40:24.505 --> 40:27.549
-Then, my friends, you must read...
-Don't do that to me.

40:28.342 --> 40:30.969
l look forward to reading your papers.

40:31.846 --> 40:34.055
You'll never get him.

40:34.140 --> 40:35.181
Watch me.

40:40.729 --> 40:41.729
So, you haven't...

40:41.814 --> 40:45.525
Hi. Will you do
that Pepe el Romano thing, again?

40:46.026 --> 40:47.360
So, you listened?

40:47.403 --> 40:48.778
Every word.

40:50.781 --> 40:52.740
So, you're Mexican, too?

40:53.951 --> 40:55.535
No, my parents.

40:55.619 --> 40:57.579
Okay.

40:57.663 --> 40:59.706
And what are you?

40:59.790 --> 41:02.375
American, of course.

41:02.460 --> 41:05.211
Well, and Mexican. So, Mexican-American.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.715
American-Mexican.
My dad was more Mexican.

41:10.843 --> 41:12.010
Tell me more about you.

41:12.052 --> 41:14.721
Well, l like the color red,

41:15.848 --> 41:20.059
my iPod is full, l don't wake up before 1 0:00,
and no hablo español.

41:21.437 --> 41:23.938
l love poetry, pasta, and Prada.

41:24.607 --> 41:26.357
You?

41:26.400 --> 41:30.028
Wow, unfortunately,
l cannot list like you just did.

41:30.070 --> 41:34.866
That's very American.
But we like to sit down, drink a nice tequila,

41:34.909 --> 41:39.204
and tell each other details
until they make a full story, so to speak.

41:40.414 --> 41:41.456
lt takes hours.

41:43.042 --> 41:45.210
Well, l think l can make that time.

41:45.836 --> 41:47.420
So, it's a date?

41:48.923 --> 41:50.882
See the house right up there?

41:55.346 --> 41:56.763
Wow!

41:56.805 --> 41:59.349
-You have a very nice house.
-Don't l?

41:59.433 --> 42:01.851
Thank you so much for the ride.

42:01.936 --> 42:03.770
No, no, no. Don't get out, please.

42:03.854 --> 42:05.772
What... You're sure?

42:05.856 --> 42:10.527
Yeah. Really, l'm fine. No, no, no. No.

42:10.611 --> 42:13.738
You can go. Thank you so much for the ride.

42:13.781 --> 42:15.281
-Okay.
-Thanks.

42:15.991 --> 42:17.951
-Bye.
-l'll see you.

42:35.010 --> 42:37.345
-You're studying?
-l have to.

42:37.429 --> 42:39.681
The TA's my future husband.

42:39.765 --> 42:41.432
-The TA?
-Yeah.

42:41.475 --> 42:46.437
Oh, my gosh, he's so hot, and he's cultured,
and l can tell he comes from money.

42:49.858 --> 42:52.151
How was your first day at work?

42:52.736 --> 42:55.530
Surprising. Guess who's my boss?

42:56.407 --> 42:58.157
-Who?
-Edward.

43:00.744 --> 43:02.412
How did he get you?

43:02.496 --> 43:06.833
Well, there's only one intern job offered
in the newspaper, and obviously he knew it.

43:08.043 --> 43:09.460
Did he slip you some tongue?

43:09.503 --> 43:13.673
Mary, people don't go around the office
slipping some tongue, okay?

43:13.757 --> 43:15.258
But it was still weird.

43:15.342 --> 43:18.428
l don't know, l just never thought
that working would be like that.

43:18.804 --> 43:19.929
Like how?

43:20.014 --> 43:23.349
All those people are really uptight
and stare at you funny.

43:24.018 --> 43:26.102
Guess they're just unhappy.

43:28.022 --> 43:30.231
See, that's why l'm never gonna do it.

43:33.027 --> 43:36.279
So, mops are...

43:36.363 --> 43:38.197
-Trapeadores.
-...trapeadores.

43:38.240 --> 43:40.199
-Yeah.
-Okay. And when was this?

43:40.284 --> 43:41.784
Two weeks ago.

43:42.995 --> 43:46.581
You know, l think l have a really good case
for the law firm.

43:55.424 --> 43:56.883
Hey, bitch!

43:56.967 --> 43:59.177
What'd you say about my face?

44:01.680 --> 44:04.807
l just said that l liked your eyeliner.

44:06.977 --> 44:09.729
Hey, yo. We good, ladies?

44:10.689 --> 44:11.731
Yeah, Bruno.

44:11.774 --> 44:13.900
Catch you later, white girl.

44:16.403 --> 44:17.820
l'm Mexican.

44:22.284 --> 44:23.618
Thank you.

44:27.164 --> 44:28.623
Sorry, sorry.

44:37.174 --> 44:40.134
Hi. lt's nice to see you.

44:40.219 --> 44:44.097
Have you found anything interesting
in those depositions yet?

44:44.139 --> 44:45.139
Not yet.

44:45.224 --> 44:48.851
But l did meet a lady on the bus
with an interesting case.

44:49.603 --> 44:51.020
You rode the bus?

44:51.105 --> 44:52.772
Good place to find clients.

44:53.774 --> 44:54.899
That don't pay.

44:55.109 --> 44:56.859
That's why we have pro bono.

44:56.944 --> 44:59.779
Yeah. Well, you want to know
what the problem with pro bono is?

44:59.822 --> 45:01.239
You can't charge.

45:05.703 --> 45:06.786
Yeah.

45:08.205 --> 45:11.457
ln the conference room?
A bunch of cleaning ladies?

45:12.584 --> 45:14.460
They're my clients.
That's what l came to tell you.

45:14.545 --> 45:16.170
l need your help.

45:17.881 --> 45:20.299
lt's fine. They're clients.

45:21.343 --> 45:23.386
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

45:30.477 --> 45:32.145
You speak Spanish?

45:32.604 --> 45:34.272
Of course. l grew up in LA.

45:36.984 --> 45:41.487
These women, all janitors,
were fired from their company

45:41.572 --> 45:46.159
the day before they qualified for benefits,
for taking mops.

45:49.538 --> 45:50.663
Mops?

45:55.043 --> 45:57.670
l think Lorca was a great poet.

45:57.755 --> 45:59.547
Me, too.

45:59.631 --> 46:02.300
There's a poem that my nanny
used to tell me in Spanish,

46:02.342 --> 46:03.760
when she would put me to sleep.

46:04.094 --> 46:06.304
"The houses reveal faces

46:06.346 --> 46:08.639
"And the grasses, poppies, and vines dance

46:09.016 --> 46:11.726
"To the sound of the breeze from the sun"

46:13.061 --> 46:14.437
l love it.

46:14.521 --> 46:16.814
l still dream about that house.

46:17.900 --> 46:20.318
l dream about a house, too.

46:20.360 --> 46:22.028
Really? You do?

46:22.070 --> 46:23.488
Yes.

46:23.530 --> 46:27.950
lt's... lt's really Californian.

46:28.035 --> 46:32.580
And it's surrounded
by these big, blue-eyed jacarandas.

46:32.706 --> 46:36.876
And there's a Spanish fountain,
and it's wrapped in this tile,

46:36.960 --> 46:39.170
and it sings night and day.

46:39.213 --> 46:42.173
And there are these oranges
that ooze this sweet nectar...

46:42.216 --> 46:45.927
Wait, wait, wait.
l must taste them to see how sweet it is.

46:59.942 --> 47:03.277
California is so decadent.

47:03.362 --> 47:05.363
l'm gonna buy a house here.

47:05.405 --> 47:06.656
You are?

47:07.449 --> 47:09.450
You should buy the house
l was telling you about.

47:09.535 --> 47:12.161
-Which one?
-My house. lt's for sale.

47:13.455 --> 47:15.623
What do you mean? The house
where l've been dropping you off?

47:17.209 --> 47:19.544
No, because that's my new house.

47:20.420 --> 47:23.881
The house that l was telling you about
is my old house,

47:24.591 --> 47:26.634
and it's amazing.

47:26.718 --> 47:27.760
Love to see it.

47:28.136 --> 47:29.428
Will you show it to me?

47:30.347 --> 47:31.430
Yeah.

47:33.851 --> 47:40.356
Why is it taking so long
to gut this ugly room?

47:40.440 --> 47:43.568
Sorry, ma'am. lt will be done tonight.

47:43.610 --> 47:45.570
That is the downside of construction.

47:45.612 --> 47:49.031
Have you ever met lazier people
in your entire life?

47:49.116 --> 47:51.701
Clearly, there is no leadership here.

47:52.119 --> 47:55.746
Chop-chop! Could you turn off the radio?
lt sounds like a taco truck in here.

47:55.789 --> 47:57.123
Wouldn't you agree, Lucy?

47:57.165 --> 47:58.374
Olivia...

47:59.501 --> 48:04.714
l think if you were nicer to them,
they might work faster for you, no?

48:06.008 --> 48:08.384
lf l'm gonna make you my sister-in-law,
you need to know

48:08.468 --> 48:12.555
that there is a fine line
between niceness and weakness.

48:12.639 --> 48:14.807
And l never cross it.

48:25.027 --> 48:26.152
Gabe?

48:27.779 --> 48:28.821
What happened to you?

48:30.157 --> 48:34.076
Will you stop obsessing about your father
and help me out here?

48:59.019 --> 49:00.353
What?

49:00.437 --> 49:02.688
You know all the words.

49:02.773 --> 49:05.691
Yeah. l just don't know what they mean.

49:07.527 --> 49:10.696
"Singing lightens the heart, my little sky."

49:12.032 --> 49:13.199
Wow.

49:13.241 --> 49:15.534
You're becoming quite the little diccionario.

49:16.036 --> 49:20.331
But "cielito lindo"
doesn't actually mean "little sky."

49:20.374 --> 49:26.212
lt means something more endearing,
like "sweetheart" or "darling."

49:29.758 --> 49:30.883
Yeah.

49:32.052 --> 49:34.261
l seriously need to learn Spanish.

49:34.346 --> 49:38.391
l mean, l'm really finding Mexican culture,
like, intoxicating.

49:39.476 --> 49:40.643
No.

49:40.727 --> 49:42.520
Wait, do you remember the TA
l was telling you about?

49:42.729 --> 49:45.022
-Yes.
-He is so Mexican.

49:45.732 --> 49:47.316
Dad would have loved him.

49:47.401 --> 49:49.902
Yeah, he's gonna buy a house in LA.

49:50.237 --> 49:51.362
Okay.

49:52.572 --> 49:54.407
Our house.

49:54.491 --> 49:55.866
Your house?

49:56.243 --> 49:57.576
Does he know this yet?

49:57.828 --> 49:59.078
Not yet.

49:59.788 --> 50:02.581
And when are you planning on telling him?

50:04.084 --> 50:05.126
Our engagement.

50:05.919 --> 50:07.044
Okay.

50:10.924 --> 50:12.383
Are you serious?

50:13.677 --> 50:15.636
My service was just discontinued.

50:15.721 --> 50:18.431
Well, you better get engaged soon then.

50:30.527 --> 50:33.154
Honestly, l don't think we have a case.

50:33.238 --> 50:36.365
We know that they fired you
to get out of benefit obligations.

50:36.450 --> 50:40.286
But these depositions,
they don't offer any legal proof.

50:40.787 --> 50:42.663
l mean, basically,
it's your word against theirs.

50:42.748 --> 50:45.708
And they are going to be ruthless.

50:46.418 --> 50:48.294
There must be a way to fight them.

50:48.336 --> 50:49.795
Well, you can't win on the mops.

50:49.880 --> 50:53.883
But, l mean, in theory,
if you had something on them,

50:53.967 --> 50:56.969
you could compel them
to reinstate the workers.

50:57.012 --> 50:59.472
Do you mean like cleaning asbestos?

51:00.515 --> 51:02.725
Or getting demoted for getting pregnant?

51:03.477 --> 51:06.145
Or cheating time cards to pay us less?

51:07.856 --> 51:11.650
Yes. Yeah, those would certainly all qualify.

51:12.652 --> 51:14.653
But can you prove it?

51:16.656 --> 51:19.450
Wait, Edward,
what about third party evidence?

51:20.035 --> 51:21.118
l don't follow.

51:21.828 --> 51:22.828
Let me explain.

51:22.913 --> 51:24.580
Marco Antonio, do you have the time cards?

51:24.831 --> 51:26.040
Yes. Okay.

51:26.792 --> 51:28.584
We can prove they are committing fraud.

51:29.669 --> 51:31.962
l commute with these janitors every day.

51:32.506 --> 51:34.840
Every day on the same bus.

51:36.259 --> 51:37.343
-Here they are.
-Thank you.

51:43.975 --> 51:45.392
What's this?

51:47.979 --> 51:49.105
This is good.

51:49.189 --> 51:50.981
Day of what?

51:51.024 --> 51:52.358
Screaming.

51:53.902 --> 51:54.902
History, Mary.

51:56.363 --> 51:58.364
lndependence day, hombre.

51:58.448 --> 52:00.241
lt's a big party, mija.

52:01.952 --> 52:04.787
lf you want, l can make you a blouse.

52:05.205 --> 52:07.540
Actually, can you make this?

52:07.749 --> 52:09.959
lt'll look so hot, but shorter. Like, look.

52:20.387 --> 52:22.096
Do you have boyfriends?

52:22.180 --> 52:24.056
Me, always. She, never.

52:24.558 --> 52:26.767
No boyfriend, why?

52:26.852 --> 52:29.186
Tia, l just don't have the time.

52:30.230 --> 52:31.647
Work and no fun.

52:34.025 --> 52:36.485
You, invite your boyfriend.

52:36.570 --> 52:38.988
This is an important family party.

52:42.534 --> 52:44.285
Do we embarrass you?

52:48.915 --> 52:52.168
The first quality of your father,
he had so few,

52:53.086 --> 52:56.255
is that he had huevos.

52:56.923 --> 53:01.510
He was valiante
and always proud of his family.

53:25.118 --> 53:29.705
So, like, do you ever get paid,
or do you just get off on working for free?

53:30.874 --> 53:33.292
Wow, is that a new word
you just learned? "Work"?

53:34.628 --> 53:37.338
Well, see, l would do it
if it didn't involve labor.

53:39.341 --> 53:41.091
What are you doing?

53:42.636 --> 53:43.802
Magic.

53:46.097 --> 53:49.266
With this. Nice. lt's junk.

53:49.309 --> 53:54.563
See, the thing is, princess, is that
you can hate this for what you think it is

53:54.648 --> 53:58.234
or you can love it
for what you know it can become.

53:58.318 --> 54:01.654
Wow. Sounds like you're building a mission,
Father Bruno.

54:01.738 --> 54:04.323
-Okay.
-We need a party, not a chapel.

54:06.701 --> 54:09.161
Hey, you know where Birds of Paradise is?

54:10.038 --> 54:11.413
A metaphor?

54:12.123 --> 54:13.207
A flower.

54:13.291 --> 54:16.335
They're for decorations.
Can you get some of those for me?

54:16.419 --> 54:21.006
They're the ones
that look like Birds of Paradise.

54:25.845 --> 54:28.514
Seriously, not gonna help.

54:30.850 --> 54:32.184
Wanna bet?

54:33.687 --> 54:36.647
Yeah, actually. Name it.

54:37.691 --> 54:39.400
l will make the party beautiful,

54:39.943 --> 54:41.652
and you give me a dance.

54:43.029 --> 54:45.281
All right, you got it, my man.

54:46.616 --> 54:48.617
l'm late for my manicure.

54:56.501 --> 54:59.044
My client is not reinstating these employees.

54:59.129 --> 55:00.421
-He's not?
-No, counselor.

55:00.505 --> 55:02.381
They have stolen my client's property.

55:02.424 --> 55:05.217
Let's talk about that for a moment. Stealing.

55:05.302 --> 55:07.303
We believe that we have
a fraud case against you

55:07.387 --> 55:08.929
for stealing from these employees.

55:09.014 --> 55:10.389
Hardly.

55:10.432 --> 55:13.392
Come on,
they're lucky l haven't called the lNS.

55:17.689 --> 55:20.482
These pay stubs show that
you've been paying them seven hours a day.

55:21.359 --> 55:23.444
We have paid them
for what they have worked.

55:23.528 --> 55:28.657
As you can see, these time cards
are punched in for eight hours or more.

55:31.411 --> 55:32.536
Where did you get those?

55:33.872 --> 55:36.665
This is Maria Ramirez.
She does your payroll.

55:36.750 --> 55:40.586
l don't know if you knew that her niece,
Rosalita Ramirez, is a janitor at your firm.

55:40.670 --> 55:43.881
Maria called her brother,
Marco Antonio Ramirez,

55:43.923 --> 55:46.592
who just so happens
to supervise your time card machine.

55:47.218 --> 55:49.053
His wife, Angelica Ramirez,
is right over there.

55:49.137 --> 55:50.387
She works for you, too.

55:50.680 --> 55:52.765
No, no, no, wait.
She is my cousin Esperanza.

55:52.849 --> 55:53.974
That is my wife.

55:55.477 --> 55:58.312
Sorry about that. What's important
is that l have all their depositions.

56:00.148 --> 56:01.774
ln short, sir,

56:01.858 --> 56:05.027
you call the lNS, we'll call the lRS.

56:08.031 --> 56:10.074
-Let's go.
-This is a joke.

56:11.451 --> 56:12.785
You've won.

56:25.507 --> 56:27.758
Thank you. That was amazing.

56:27.801 --> 56:29.176
We should celebrate.

56:29.260 --> 56:32.012
Actually, there is a party at my aunt's.

56:32.097 --> 56:34.515
lt's a Mexican holiday where we scream.

56:34.599 --> 56:37.851
The janitors will be there
and the neighbors and their families,

56:37.936 --> 56:39.478
if you dare to come.

56:39.521 --> 56:42.231
l have been to your hood before,
so l think l can risk it.

56:42.857 --> 56:44.483
That's pretty bold for an outsider.

56:45.276 --> 56:46.985
lt's amazing the things
that one does for love...

56:47.070 --> 56:48.612
Of public good.

56:49.656 --> 56:50.906
Well, we'll be waiting for you.

56:51.157 --> 56:53.492
And l wouldn't let those janitors down.

56:53.576 --> 56:54.827
l won't.

56:58.164 --> 56:59.248
You okay?

56:59.999 --> 57:01.500
l'm fine.

57:02.460 --> 57:03.794
That's it.

57:09.259 --> 57:10.300
Wow.

57:14.848 --> 57:16.306
Who lives here?

57:18.143 --> 57:19.184
Me.

57:22.188 --> 57:24.273
lt's actually kind of funny.

57:24.858 --> 57:28.402
The house that
you have been dropping me off at,

57:28.486 --> 57:30.904
l don't even know who lives there.

57:37.954 --> 57:41.957
Look, when my dad died, we lost everything.

57:42.584 --> 57:43.959
Even the house that we grew up in.

57:44.043 --> 57:47.045
And l lied to you because l really like you.

57:52.886 --> 57:54.052
Sorry.

57:56.347 --> 57:58.348
This is where l live now.

58:00.477 --> 58:02.686
Yeah, you can go if you want.

58:58.993 --> 59:01.912
Don't look, but they're totally
checking us out in the window.

59:03.081 --> 59:04.164
So be prepared for some,

59:04.249 --> 59:06.750
"Mary, look,
you brought a friend from school,"

59:06.793 --> 59:08.794
even though they totally
already know who you are.

59:16.970 --> 59:19.263
Mary, a friend from school?

59:29.566 --> 59:32.609
l have no idea what just happened,
and l'm really sorry.

59:37.991 --> 59:40.242
Wow, this is cool.

59:40.368 --> 59:41.868
How beautiful.

59:42.579 --> 59:44.371
Come on, let's dance.

59:48.918 --> 59:51.753
Okay, give me back my boyfriend.
Thank you.

01:00:01.055 --> 01:00:04.725
You look beautiful.

01:00:06.686 --> 01:00:08.895
You look very, very beautiful.

01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:29.541
You have to teach me how to salsa.

01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:48.560
Okay, okay.
You can have him, but for five minutes only.

01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:49.645
Only five minutes.

01:00:51.064 --> 01:00:53.482
-Take care of him.
-Okay, okay, okay.

01:00:59.447 --> 01:01:03.367
Hey, you shouldn't waste the state's flower.
We're in a drought.

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:09.581
So, you clean up all right.
You know, for a homeboy, you look good.

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:14.086
l'm not gonna lie.
This place looks really, really great.

01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:15.212
You did a good job.

01:01:15.254 --> 01:01:18.256
So, l lost the bet,
and l want to be good on my part.

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:19.716
Let's have that dance.

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:21.718
After you, sir.

01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:27.724
You ain't got to worry about it.

01:01:28.601 --> 01:01:30.268
You didn't lose.

01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:36.942
l did.

01:01:44.784 --> 01:01:45.951
Sorry.

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:53.125
-Edward. Hi.
-Hi.

01:01:53.209 --> 01:01:54.418
Hi.

01:01:55.294 --> 01:01:58.463
Wow, you look like Frida Kahlo.

01:01:59.632 --> 01:02:00.632
Thank you.

01:02:01.008 --> 01:02:03.969
Yeah, the Salma Hayek version,
without the moustache either.

01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:05.387
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:02:06.097 --> 01:02:07.389
Jeez, your aunt throws a kicking party.

01:02:07.473 --> 01:02:09.349
l gotta make it
to this side of town more often.

01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:10.976
l love it here.

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:12.644
You'd stay if you had the choice?

01:02:13.521 --> 01:02:15.439
Yes, l would.

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:20.569
Where would you go if you had the choice?

01:02:22.155 --> 01:02:23.530
Right across the street.

01:02:23.614 --> 01:02:24.990
Yeah, right.

01:02:25.533 --> 01:02:27.242
Where is Nora Dominguez?

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:31.955
Nora Dominguez is
at the bottom of Mr. Tequila.

01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:36.418
Wow. Well, to celebrate
and, you know, to get me caught up.

01:02:36.502 --> 01:02:38.962
-Okay, perfect.
-Great.

01:02:42.508 --> 01:02:45.677
You were fantastic yesterday.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:48.305
Thanks. Yeah, to tell you the truth,
l surprised myself.

01:02:48.347 --> 01:02:50.974
l go to court to deal with conglomerates,
never people.

01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:53.560
Yeah, but people bring out the best in you.

01:02:53.644 --> 01:02:56.730
You galvanized those janitors.

01:02:56.814 --> 01:02:58.690
You were so charismatic.

01:02:58.733 --> 01:03:00.817
-l was?
-Yes.

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:05.864
Yes, you were. Like a general

01:03:06.365 --> 01:03:09.409
-leading his troops.
-Wow.

01:03:09.494 --> 01:03:11.369
And when you slammed those cards
on the table...

01:03:11.412 --> 01:03:14.289
-Yes?
-l wanted to...

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:17.542
-Yeah?
-l wanted to...

01:03:17.585 --> 01:03:19.461
You know what, Edward?

01:03:19.545 --> 01:03:22.839
l don't really know what l wanted to do,

01:03:22.882 --> 01:03:25.342
but l have to tell you,

01:03:26.427 --> 01:03:28.887
l've never met someone

01:03:29.889 --> 01:03:33.517
so... So...

01:03:50.743 --> 01:03:53.370
l just came in for a fork.

01:04:00.336 --> 01:04:02.629
-What just happened?
-We kissed.

01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:05.215
We?

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:07.259
Yeah, you kissed me, too.

01:04:08.469 --> 01:04:12.514
Oh, dear. l shouldn't have done that.

01:04:13.432 --> 01:04:16.434
-Why not?
-This isn't me.

01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:18.603
No, no, no, this is you.

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.438
That's what l've been trying to tell you.

01:04:20.481 --> 01:04:24.734
l... l'm a lawyer.
l mean, l wanna be a good lawyer

01:04:24.777 --> 01:04:29.364
and set up, you know,
a community service and a legal practice.

01:04:29.448 --> 01:04:31.616
-Yeah, well, you...
-And l have my 1 0-year plan.

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:34.119
You can do all that with me.
We'd make a great team.

01:04:34.161 --> 01:04:36.872
-You're my boss.
-Okay, l'll fire you then.

01:04:36.956 --> 01:04:39.332
You're not taking me seriously.

01:04:39.417 --> 01:04:43.712
You know, l need to maintain
1 00% focus on my work,

01:04:43.796 --> 01:04:46.214
and that's all l want,
and that's all l have room for.

01:04:46.299 --> 01:04:48.633
You can't tell me
that you didn't feel something, too.

01:04:48.676 --> 01:04:50.176
That's not the point.

01:04:50.261 --> 01:04:52.345
Nora, stop arguing a case.

01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:55.223
Please...

01:04:56.684 --> 01:04:58.476
l'm falling for you.

01:05:00.813 --> 01:05:02.689
You don't know me.

01:05:05.526 --> 01:05:07.527
And as far as l can tell,

01:05:08.988 --> 01:05:12.782
l'm just another girl
who answered your ad in the newspaper.

01:05:19.373 --> 01:05:20.749
Well, then,

01:05:22.668 --> 01:05:25.462
l guess it's time to place a new one then.

01:06:04.919 --> 01:06:07.045
Having a party of your own?

01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:15.887
ls there something wrong with me?

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:19.265
No.

01:06:37.118 --> 01:06:41.246
You know, sometimes you play a game

01:06:44.083 --> 01:06:46.710
even when you know you're gonna lose.

01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:53.758
Or sometimes,

01:06:56.303 --> 01:06:59.889
you leave a game
even when you know you can win.

01:07:07.064 --> 01:07:09.107
l wouldn't leave that game.

01:07:16.574 --> 01:07:19.075
The remodel is actually much bigger
than we planned.

01:07:19.118 --> 01:07:21.953
l'm finally getting to use my design skills.

01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:24.998
Edward, what a surprise.
l didn't think you'd come.

01:07:27.168 --> 01:07:30.295
God, you look like
you just came from a funeral.

01:07:31.922 --> 01:07:33.965
l lost a case today.

01:07:34.425 --> 01:07:37.135
Well, you win some, you lose some.

01:07:37.219 --> 01:07:39.846
Yeah, this one l really wanted to win.

01:07:40.473 --> 01:07:44.893
Well, stop being a buzzkill
and meet my friend Lucy.

01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:31.773
Shit.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.519
What happened to my desk?

01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:11.229
He didn't tell you about the transfer?

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:12.939
What transfer?

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:17.609
Yours. But don't fret, it's a promotion.

01:09:17.694 --> 01:09:21.322
Bigger salary, more benefits, good luck.

01:09:22.116 --> 01:09:24.242
Go to Tower B, 30th floor.

01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:29.247
Maybe now we can get back to work?

01:09:39.925 --> 01:09:41.134
Well, then l quit.

01:09:51.395 --> 01:09:53.604
l need to tell you something.

01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:55.732
Yeah?

01:09:57.109 --> 01:10:00.028
l have to go to Mexico for a while
to see my family.

01:10:02.615 --> 01:10:04.282
Well, for how long?

01:10:04.366 --> 01:10:06.075
A couple of weeks.

01:10:06.118 --> 01:10:07.452
Maybe three.

01:10:07.828 --> 01:10:09.329
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:10:10.289 --> 01:10:13.291
Well, l miss you already.

01:10:16.086 --> 01:10:17.295
Me, too.

01:10:27.765 --> 01:10:28.806
Bye.

01:10:33.145 --> 01:10:35.021
Hey. What?

01:10:42.029 --> 01:10:43.363
What do you know about this guy?

01:10:43.447 --> 01:10:46.407
He's a gentleman.
Oh, my gosh, Nora, l'm in love.

01:10:47.117 --> 01:10:48.826
And l'm moving out in two weeks.

01:10:48.911 --> 01:10:50.995
Has he told you he loves you?

01:10:51.038 --> 01:10:53.164
Okay, seriously, you just don't get it.

01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:56.251
He's strong and silent, okay? l just know.

01:10:57.503 --> 01:10:58.670
You know what?

01:11:00.339 --> 01:11:02.173
Remember, two-for-one?

01:11:02.216 --> 01:11:03.633
Thanks.

01:11:03.676 --> 01:11:06.552
-Mary, you just met him.
-So?

01:11:06.637 --> 01:11:08.721
That's not love.

01:11:08.806 --> 01:11:11.474
Okay, how do you know what love is?

01:11:11.517 --> 01:11:12.850
What's wrong with you?

01:11:13.185 --> 01:11:15.311
What do you want from him?

01:11:15.354 --> 01:11:17.272
l want to go back to Beverly Hills, Nora.

01:11:17.773 --> 01:11:20.525
Okay, there, l said it. lt's all l want. Okay?

01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:23.528
lt's all l've wanted since we got here,
and he can give that to me.

01:11:23.612 --> 01:11:28.199
He's cute, he's sexy,
and he has lots of money.

01:11:28.701 --> 01:11:31.494
He loves taking care of things. Why not me?

01:11:31.537 --> 01:11:35.081
lt's the oldest story in the book.
Does that make me such a bad person?

01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:38.543
lt makes you a whore.

01:11:42.715 --> 01:11:44.173
Better than the spinster.

01:13:07.549 --> 01:13:10.176
My gosh! That's our house!

01:14:57.576 --> 01:14:59.327
l made chicken soup.

01:15:00.871 --> 01:15:03.581
-ls something wrong?
-No.

01:15:07.044 --> 01:15:11.881
Well, obviously something is going on,
so why don't you tell me what's going on?

01:15:18.263 --> 01:15:20.097
This came by mail.

01:15:21.433 --> 01:15:23.768
-What is it?
-An invitation.

01:15:24.895 --> 01:15:27.104
To Edward's engagement party.

01:15:41.662 --> 01:15:42.912
Finally.

01:15:44.706 --> 01:15:45.957
You knew?

01:15:49.127 --> 01:15:50.503
Yeah, yeah.

01:15:52.798 --> 01:15:54.173
Can we eat?

01:15:59.304 --> 01:16:01.931
Do you like aguacate, Mary?

01:16:01.974 --> 01:16:05.851
No. Actually, no. This is perfect. Thanks.

01:16:05.936 --> 01:16:09.814
You know, the best for the chicken soup
is aguacate...

01:16:53.692 --> 01:16:54.775
Mary.

01:17:09.791 --> 01:17:10.875
Hey.

01:17:16.673 --> 01:17:18.466
You have to tell him.

01:17:22.554 --> 01:17:24.055
lt's too late.

01:17:25.599 --> 01:17:27.558
lf he announces an engagement that quick,

01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:31.187
it just means that he is way more confused
than you are.

01:17:34.274 --> 01:17:35.775
What can l do?

01:17:37.152 --> 01:17:38.653
Just tell him.

01:17:40.238 --> 01:17:44.533
Just tell him how you feel,
or else you're gonna end up regretting it.

01:17:45.827 --> 01:17:47.078
Okay? What Olivia doesn't know

01:17:47.162 --> 01:17:50.623
is that she has just given you
a wonderful opportunity.

01:17:54.461 --> 01:17:56.253
l don't think l can.

01:18:00.884 --> 01:18:01.967
Well,

01:18:04.096 --> 01:18:05.846
l'm going with you.

01:18:09.267 --> 01:18:11.268
That scares me even more.

01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:13.479
Shut up.

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:46.053
Are you serious? Gosh! You look like a nun.

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:47.805
-Nora, this is war.
-What?

01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:49.473
What? What's wrong with it?

01:18:49.516 --> 01:18:51.434
You look so hot.

01:18:51.518 --> 01:18:53.936
l can't walk. These are way too high.

01:18:54.604 --> 01:18:56.147
Okay, turn around. Spin.

01:18:56.565 --> 01:18:57.648
He's gonna love this.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.984
What? What are you doing?

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:02.653
-l might as well be naked.
-Are you serious?

01:19:02.696 --> 01:19:04.488
Stop. Okay. Come on.

01:19:06.283 --> 01:19:08.993
-Still too tight.
-Stand up straight.

01:19:09.453 --> 01:19:11.162
-What? No.
-You look beautiful.

01:19:11.204 --> 01:19:12.830
No. You look beautiful.

01:19:18.628 --> 01:19:21.464
l don't know. What?

01:19:32.017 --> 01:19:33.142
Baby.

01:19:33.185 --> 01:19:35.060
You look so beautiful.

01:19:38.273 --> 01:19:40.775
You look so tall with these shoes,
it goes like...

01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:22.399
ls this the right house?

01:20:23.568 --> 01:20:24.985
Yeah, it is.

01:20:26.446 --> 01:20:28.572
What happened to our house?

01:20:31.284 --> 01:20:34.495
lt's like a supermax prison
with Christmas lights.

01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:37.540
So gray.

01:20:39.751 --> 01:20:43.212
-ls that Juanito?
-Yeah. Look at their uniforms.

01:20:45.257 --> 01:20:46.799
Hi!

01:20:46.883 --> 01:20:49.260
What do you think of my new ride?

01:20:50.929 --> 01:20:53.514
Juanito. Look what l brought you.

01:20:53.598 --> 01:20:56.225
-For old times' sake, huh?
-Thank you.

01:20:56.268 --> 01:20:58.602
-How are you?
-Fine. And you?

01:20:58.687 --> 01:21:00.229
-Good.
-Hi, bonita.

01:21:03.441 --> 01:21:05.025
What a surprise!

01:21:09.447 --> 01:21:12.116
-You look so nice.
-You, too, Carmina.

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:20.499
They walled in the view.

01:21:21.209 --> 01:21:23.127
For this ugly painting.

01:21:26.298 --> 01:21:28.340
Our house is gone forever.

01:21:32.053 --> 01:21:33.304
Come on.

01:21:46.443 --> 01:21:48.068
Who invited them?

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:51.155
Gabe insisted. l can't believe they came.

01:21:52.407 --> 01:21:56.118
Well, at the very least,
they get to experience my remodel.

01:21:58.163 --> 01:21:59.663
Who are they?

01:22:00.749 --> 01:22:01.790
Hi.

01:22:02.834 --> 01:22:06.128
We were pretty surprised
to receive your invitation,

01:22:06.171 --> 01:22:08.005
but we're really happy to be here.

01:22:08.173 --> 01:22:09.673
Late, as per usual.

01:22:09.966 --> 01:22:12.259
Yeah, well, l'm Mexican, you know.

01:22:14.971 --> 01:22:18.515
Let me introduce you to Edward's intended,
Lucy Parker.

01:22:19.142 --> 01:22:22.519
This is Mary and Nora Dominguez,
members of my family.

01:22:22.604 --> 01:22:25.397
-Good evening.
-You're a very lucky woman.

01:22:26.358 --> 01:22:27.691
Thank you.

01:22:27.984 --> 01:22:30.027
-He's a great guy.
-How would you know?

01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:31.862
l would know.

01:22:40.455 --> 01:22:42.456
Gabe, can l talk to you for a minute
in private?

01:22:42.666 --> 01:22:43.749
More family secrets?

01:22:44.042 --> 01:22:46.085
-Yes, Olivia.
-l don't think so.

01:22:50.382 --> 01:22:52.883
She says she loves your remodeling.

01:22:54.177 --> 01:22:56.595
Yeah. l would... Happy to...

01:22:57.722 --> 01:23:01.016
-Congratulations.
-Thank you. Thank you for coming.

01:23:07.857 --> 01:23:09.566
Need some martinis.

01:23:19.911 --> 01:23:22.871
So, what do you really think
about the house?

01:23:23.164 --> 01:23:25.874
Well, it looks like MTV Cribs,

01:23:27.210 --> 01:23:29.503
but l'm really happy
that you kept Dad's office.

01:23:29.587 --> 01:23:34.008
Yeah, well.
l had to fight Olivia for it, but it was worth it.

01:23:36.094 --> 01:23:38.762
lt's the only thing l have left of him.

01:23:48.106 --> 01:23:49.815
Actually, it's not.

01:24:42.827 --> 01:24:43.911
Nora?

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.876
Mary forced me to come,

01:24:53.088 --> 01:24:56.215
and now l'm here in front of you,

01:24:57.300 --> 01:25:00.385
without words, which is crazy

01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:02.888
because l always know what to say.

01:25:03.890 --> 01:25:06.225
And l'm kind of having
this whole second-guessing game

01:25:06.309 --> 01:25:07.851
going through my head right now,

01:25:07.894 --> 01:25:11.146
and l kind of want to dig a hole right there

01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:13.524
-and kind ofjust...
-Nora.

01:25:15.693 --> 01:25:16.985
Why here?

01:25:26.371 --> 01:25:28.580
When you kissed me that night,

01:25:30.250 --> 01:25:32.960
l had never felt those emotions before.

01:25:36.089 --> 01:25:39.383
l avoid relationships
because l can't count on them.

01:25:40.135 --> 01:25:43.220
First my mother's death,
and then my father's.

01:25:48.393 --> 01:25:50.727
l've built my whole life

01:25:52.063 --> 01:25:55.816
counting on the one thing l can control,
which is my career.

01:25:58.903 --> 01:26:00.904
And then you came along.

01:26:09.372 --> 01:26:10.873
l resisted you

01:26:12.417 --> 01:26:14.251
not for lack of love,

01:26:16.546 --> 01:26:19.590
but because l was afraid
of losing myself in it.

01:26:29.601 --> 01:26:30.809
Edward?

01:26:32.478 --> 01:26:36.773
-They want to see you in there.
-Yeah. Yes, l will be right there.

01:26:42.655 --> 01:26:45.657
-Edward. l really need you.
-Yeah. l'm coming.

01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:51.246
Edward.

01:27:12.810 --> 01:27:14.019
Thanks.

01:27:25.615 --> 01:27:26.657
Rodrigo?

01:27:28.117 --> 01:27:29.701
Hey, Mary.

01:27:31.579 --> 01:27:33.413
What a surprise to see you here.

01:27:34.707 --> 01:27:36.667
l thought you were in Mexico.

01:27:36.751 --> 01:27:40.170
Yeah. Yeah, l was. l just came back.

01:27:43.508 --> 01:27:46.218
l want you to meet Natalia, my wife.

01:27:47.011 --> 01:27:51.348
Mary was by far my best student this year.

01:27:51.808 --> 01:27:54.184
-Right?
-Nice to meet you.

01:27:54.811 --> 01:27:58.605
You should come to dinner
when we settle into the house.

01:27:58.690 --> 01:27:59.773
Yeah.

01:28:01.025 --> 01:28:04.278
-You bought this house?
-Yeah. He seduced me with it.

01:28:04.362 --> 01:28:05.696
l used to hate LA,

01:28:06.447 --> 01:28:08.532
and now l love this house.

01:28:11.327 --> 01:28:13.829
Hey. Good to see you again.

01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:29.219
Mary!

01:28:29.721 --> 01:28:31.638
Mary! Mary!

01:28:56.831 --> 01:28:57.873
Come on!

01:29:03.796 --> 01:29:04.880
Why?

01:29:06.507 --> 01:29:07.549
No!

01:29:10.762 --> 01:29:12.095
Stupid!

01:29:53.846 --> 01:29:55.013
Start!

01:30:41.686 --> 01:30:43.061
How is she?

01:30:43.604 --> 01:30:45.689
We're still waiting for an update.

01:30:48.151 --> 01:30:49.943
l'm glad you're here.

01:30:50.528 --> 01:30:52.863
-We're family, aren't we?
-Yeah.

01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:56.992
How is...

01:30:57.493 --> 01:30:59.286
-Olivia.
-Yeah. Right.

01:30:59.412 --> 01:31:00.829
We split up.

01:31:03.916 --> 01:31:05.250
l'm sorry.

01:31:06.294 --> 01:31:07.377
Why?

01:31:26.230 --> 01:31:28.690
Enough. We have to try everything.

01:31:33.279 --> 01:31:35.030
What are you doing?

01:31:35.656 --> 01:31:38.867
-l don't think that's right.
-Mary. Mary, wake up!

01:31:44.081 --> 01:31:45.207
What?

01:31:47.168 --> 01:31:48.543
Mary. Mary!

01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:51.421
Wake up before they kill you.

01:31:55.259 --> 01:31:56.968
What are you doing?

01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:07.771
-Stop.
-l want to...

01:32:12.944 --> 01:32:14.319
-Fast?
-Yeah.

01:32:25.957 --> 01:32:26.998
Hi.

01:32:30.795 --> 01:32:32.796
Please don't drop me. Seriously.

01:32:43.975 --> 01:32:46.142
ls that Bruno's new project?

01:32:46.269 --> 01:32:48.979
He did it overnight for you especially.

01:32:49.188 --> 01:32:51.273
He didn't come visit me in the hospital.

01:32:59.865 --> 01:33:01.157
You okay?

01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:04.744
Remember when we first got here?

01:33:04.996 --> 01:33:07.539
l seriously thought l was gonna die.

01:33:07.915 --> 01:33:09.457
You almost did.

01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:14.796
l was really selfish.

01:33:19.594 --> 01:33:23.054
You were just in love
with someone who didn't love you.

01:33:24.473 --> 01:33:25.724
You knew?

01:33:28.519 --> 01:33:31.855
l didn't realize l was in love
with someone who did.

01:33:34.692 --> 01:33:38.069
You know, it's really hard
to drink with a neck brace.

01:34:44.428 --> 01:34:47.514
lt's like a community's photo album.
All right?

01:34:48.224 --> 01:34:52.852
Every picture we paint
tells our stories. Right?

01:34:54.105 --> 01:34:57.607
Every muralist has a mentor.
My mentor was Judy Barker.

01:34:57.692 --> 01:35:00.610
Now, she taught me to use our barrio's walls

01:35:00.653 --> 01:35:01.945
as a canvas to
tell your story and your story...

01:35:03.864 --> 01:35:06.282
Just cruising in my lowrider.

01:35:12.039 --> 01:35:15.417
l just wanted to come by
and say thanks for the ramp.

01:35:21.424 --> 01:35:22.632
No need.

01:35:22.758 --> 01:35:25.677
lt's for your family,
so they don't have to carry you around.

01:35:28.556 --> 01:35:30.014
Are we ever gonna be cool?

01:35:32.393 --> 01:35:34.185
Why would we be cool?

01:35:37.648 --> 01:35:39.149
You hate this.

01:35:40.484 --> 01:35:42.152
This is my world.

01:35:44.321 --> 01:35:45.488
Yeah...

01:35:46.407 --> 01:35:49.492
lt might be hard for you to believe,

01:35:53.372 --> 01:35:55.623
but l really love your world.

01:36:02.548 --> 01:36:07.969
And if l weren't in this dorky neck brace

01:36:08.846 --> 01:36:10.889
and stuck in a wheelchair,

01:36:12.057 --> 01:36:14.142
l would probably kiss you.

01:36:24.695 --> 01:36:26.362
Why can't you ever

01:36:28.115 --> 01:36:29.491
do anything

01:36:30.075 --> 01:36:31.493
on your own?

01:36:43.756 --> 01:36:46.466
All right, all right. Back to painting.

01:36:48.719 --> 01:36:51.054
Want to help me teach these kids
how to dance?

01:36:51.096 --> 01:36:53.306
l can't. l'm in a wheelchair.

01:36:53.390 --> 01:36:55.058
Dance with a brush.

01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:14.410
Robin Hood is back, with a bigger truck.

01:37:15.412 --> 01:37:17.664
We don't have another room
for the furniture, mija.

01:37:18.499 --> 01:37:19.874
Robin Hood?

01:37:47.695 --> 01:37:50.029
l need your help with something.

01:37:59.832 --> 01:38:01.457
What is all this?

01:38:03.210 --> 01:38:04.961
lt's for the house.

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:09.966
-The house?
-Yeah. The house we bought.

01:38:12.052 --> 01:38:13.511
What do you mean, "we"?

01:38:13.679 --> 01:38:16.556
Well, you know, you're gonna have to decide
which room is the master

01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:20.643
and where to put your office,
but l think everything else is "we."

01:38:22.271 --> 01:38:24.022
lf you could, please.

01:38:24.857 --> 01:38:27.650
Need you to co-sign, right here on this deed.

01:38:28.652 --> 01:38:30.236
Very important.

01:38:35.618 --> 01:38:37.660
-What about your...
-Nora.

01:38:44.209 --> 01:38:45.585
My heart is,

01:38:46.837 --> 01:38:48.838
and always has been,

01:38:49.298 --> 01:38:50.340
yours.

01:38:58.641 --> 01:39:00.016
l love you.

01:39:19.828 --> 01:39:21.037
ls that a "yes"?
