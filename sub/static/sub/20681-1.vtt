01:53.124 --> 01:56.707
Oh, for the wings.

01:56.832 --> 01:58.541
For the wings.

01:58.666 --> 02:01.416
Of a dove.

02:01.541 --> 02:04.707
Far away.

02:04.832 --> 02:09.791
Far away would I rove...

02:09.916 --> 02:13.124
Oh, for the wings.

02:13.249 --> 02:16.707
For the wings of a dove.

02:17.207 --> 02:24.082
Far away, far away.

02:24.207 --> 02:31.457
Far away, far away would I rove.

02:31.582 --> 02:37.499
In the wilderness, build me a nest.

02:37.624 --> 02:43.582
And remain there forever at rest.

02:43.707 --> 02:49.707
In the wilderness, build me a nest.

02:49.832 --> 02:52.457
Build me a nest.

02:52.582 --> 02:58.749
And remain there forever at rest.

02:58.874 --> 03:05.291
In the wilderness, build me a nest...

03:05.416 --> 03:06.707
Look, there's one.

03:06.832 --> 03:11.416
- HK. It's one I haven't got.
- Ain't you tired of that lark yet?

03:20.582 --> 03:24.332
"Enthralling new adventure
of Selwyn Pike, master sleuth,

03:24.457 --> 03:27.082
"and his youthful assistant, Smiler."

03:27.207 --> 03:31.082
- Wotcher, chaps! Tea's up!
- Joe, any luck today?

03:31.207 --> 03:35.541
No, I went for a job in an undertaker's.
I didn't get it.

03:35.666 --> 03:40.791
- Come and see the boss at our milk bar.
- I might look him up tomorrow.

03:42.416 --> 03:43.749
Load of tripe.

03:43.874 --> 03:45.749
- Found it in the road.
- Listen.

03:45.874 --> 03:50.624
"It was the work of a moment
for Smiler to force the window.

03:50.749 --> 03:53.874
"He put one leg over
and dropped to the floor."

03:53.999 --> 03:55.707
Where'd he leave the other?

03:55.832 --> 03:59.499
"Two men lay in a pool of blood
at his feet."

03:59.624 --> 04:01.291
Brr. I'm scared.

04:02.874 --> 04:06.707
"Pike must be informed at once
of this grim new development."

04:06.832 --> 04:10.291
- That's my comic!
- Get out of it!

04:10.999 --> 04:12.707
Get out of it!

04:12.832 --> 04:16.832
"Smiler stepped back towards the window
but ere he could reach it,

04:16.957 --> 04:21.916
"the garage door swung open
and Larry the Bull loomed up before him.

04:22.041 --> 04:24.207
"Smiler opened his mouth to shout,

04:24.332 --> 04:27.374
"but his cry of desperation
was instantly smothered

04:27.499 --> 04:30.374
"as a large, rough hand closed over..."

04:34.624 --> 04:36.624
Well, where's the rest of it?

04:36.749 --> 04:38.457
What do you mean?

04:38.582 --> 04:40.332
It must have blowed away.

04:40.457 --> 04:41.624
That's that.

04:41.749 --> 04:44.999
I'll get you another one in the morning.
Tuppence, please.

04:45.124 --> 04:47.666
Huh, you'll catch me
reading that kid's stuff.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.166
Give us the "Trump", please.

'"Selwyn Pike was a fast mover.

Look where you're going.

06:32.082 --> 06:33.416
Excuse me, sir.

06:33.541 --> 06:34.999
Are you Selwyn Pike?

06:35.124 --> 06:37.416
No, my name is Higgins, sorry.

06:51.791 --> 06:54.666
Three bodies I tell you!
In wooden crates!

07:03.541 --> 07:04.749
You're crackers.

07:05.791 --> 07:07.707
- Scared, are ya?
- Who, me?

07:07.832 --> 07:10.999
- Get out of it.
- OK, let's get on with it.

07:59.582 --> 08:00.624
Agh!

08:00.749 --> 08:02.166
- Well!
- You're hurting me!

08:02.291 --> 08:04.166
- Oh, yes.
- Let go, I'll explain.

08:04.291 --> 08:05.999
You'll explain to the police.

08:06.124 --> 08:08.041
Leave off! Oh!

08:09.166 --> 08:10.749
Lies, lies, lies.

08:10.874 --> 08:15.541
All big lies, I tell you, Inspector.
What I want bodies for in my business?

08:15.666 --> 08:17.874
Mr Jago, please, I'm checking that number.

08:17.999 --> 08:19.332
Sorry, inspector.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.499
Terribly sorry.

08:21.624 --> 08:22.999
But what a story.

08:23.124 --> 08:24.874
Wherever I knew such lies!

08:25.957 --> 08:28.749
You're sure it was GZ 4216?

08:28.874 --> 08:32.541
Sure as I stand here, Inspector.
Just like in that paper.

08:32.666 --> 08:36.124
Very interesting.
You see, there doesn't happen to be a GZ.

08:36.249 --> 08:39.707
See, Inspector?
He makes it all in his head.

08:39.832 --> 08:42.291
Why? He comes to rob my shop.

08:42.416 --> 08:45.124
But I knew it all the time.

08:45.249 --> 08:49.332
You've got your remedy.
I take it you wish to charge this boy.

08:49.832 --> 08:53.207
Yes, I charge him.
You will send him to prison?

08:53.332 --> 08:56.249
Right, we'll all three
get along to Bow Street.

08:56.374 --> 08:58.457
To Bow Street? Me? Now? Why?

08:58.582 --> 09:02.707
- You're the one bringing the charge.
- But Inspector, what else shall I bring?

09:02.832 --> 09:05.582
I've told you all I know.

09:05.707 --> 09:10.416
- I'm sorry, you've got to come along.
- Oh, yes, but I can't come now.

09:10.541 --> 09:12.832
I'm waiting for a customer of mine.

09:12.957 --> 09:16.582
He comes at half past nine.
He's a very big customer.

09:16.707 --> 09:18.124
Look here, Mr Jago.

09:18.249 --> 09:22.457
Either you proceed in the proper manner
or you drop the charge.

09:22.582 --> 09:25.082
Yes, please, sorry, I haven't understood.

09:25.207 --> 09:29.749
He is a very big customer.
He can't find close to my shop.

09:29.874 --> 09:32.082
You must understand, Inspector.

09:32.207 --> 09:34.832
Well, right.
Well... I'll let the boy go.

09:34.957 --> 09:36.582
What else can I do?

09:37.999 --> 09:39.291
All right, son.

09:43.124 --> 09:46.457
So sorry, Inspector.
I didn't like to waste your time.

09:46.582 --> 09:50.166
If only it would have been tomorrow,
I could have managed.

09:50.291 --> 09:51.332
Sorry.

09:55.207 --> 09:59.666
That was lucky for you, son.
You'd better cut along. Where do you work?

09:59.791 --> 10:02.416
- I'm just looking for a job.
- I see.

10:02.541 --> 10:04.249
Well, watch your step.

10:06.582 --> 10:09.624
- It was GZ 4216.
- Cut it out, son.

10:10.166 --> 10:13.999
Supposing them number plates was false
and that bloke was a crook?

10:14.124 --> 10:16.666
He wouldn't have sent for me, would he?

10:16.791 --> 10:19.291
You ought to lay off
reading those shockers.

10:19.416 --> 10:23.291
I don't think you're really a bad boy,
just a bit imaginative.

10:23.416 --> 10:27.582
- If I put you in the way of a job...
- In the CID?

10:27.707 --> 10:30.082
No, Covent Garden.

10:30.207 --> 10:33.457
Do you know Nightingale's,
the fruit and vegetable place?

10:33.582 --> 10:36.291
- No.
- Mr Nightingale is a friend of mine.

10:36.416 --> 10:39.707
He's on the lookout
for a bright boy like you.

10:39.832 --> 10:41.582
Take this along to him.

10:41.707 --> 10:43.749
Tell him I sent you.

10:43.874 --> 10:45.832
Detective Inspector Ford.

10:51.041 --> 10:53.166
Send me up some alligators too.

10:53.291 --> 10:54.332
What's that?

10:54.457 --> 10:56.999
Yeah, I could do with
a fisherman's daughter.

10:57.124 --> 11:00.666
That's the lot,
unless you've got some ins and outs in.

11:00.791 --> 11:05.332
Oh, Jim, those tennis balls are
a bit of a duff lot. They're frosted.

11:05.457 --> 11:06.832
How's the missus?

11:06.957 --> 11:08.291
Oh, too bad.

11:08.416 --> 11:11.332
Tell her to rub it with turpentine.
So long.

11:13.624 --> 11:18.249
So you're the young fellow that sees
visions on the streets of London?

11:18.374 --> 11:19.749
What's your name?

11:19.874 --> 11:21.624
- Joe Kirby, sir.
- That's right.

11:21.749 --> 11:26.166
Detective Inspector Ford has just been
telling me about you. Started young, eh?

11:26.291 --> 11:28.957
- Started what, guv'nor?
- The heebie-jeebies.

11:33.416 --> 11:36.582
- Now, let me give you some advice, Joe.
- Yes, sir.

11:36.707 --> 11:40.166
If ever you see a small jellied eel
in striped pyjamas,

11:40.291 --> 11:42.374
riding a tricycle up the wall,

11:42.499 --> 11:44.541
knock it off, boy.

11:44.666 --> 11:47.374
Don't ever touch another drop.

11:55.416 --> 11:57.916
- Good strong boy, are you?
- I reckon so.

11:58.041 --> 11:59.082
Come here.

11:59.957 --> 12:02.791
Come here, I'm not going to eat you.

12:02.916 --> 12:04.666
Bend it, bend it slowly.

12:06.082 --> 12:11.332
Oh, not a bad bit of muscle there.
All right, Joe, I'll try you out.

12:11.457 --> 12:14.416
30 shillings a week, 5am to 1 pm.

12:14.541 --> 12:16.582
And no daydreams in my time.

12:17.166 --> 12:18.499
I wasn't dreaming.

12:23.749 --> 12:26.416
Tom, this is your new assistant,
Joe Kirby.

12:26.541 --> 12:28.249
Show him the ropes.

12:28.374 --> 12:32.666
And if you find any corpses
under those spuds, give me a whistle.

13:01.082 --> 13:02.999
Ho, razor blades, ho!

13:04.207 --> 13:05.249
I got ya.

13:14.041 --> 13:16.874
All elastic, our braces,
all elastic!

13:16.999 --> 13:18.999
Razor blades, ho!

13:19.916 --> 13:22.749
All elastic, our braces, all elastic!

13:27.416 --> 13:29.707
- Our elastic braces!
- Razor blades!

13:59.916 --> 14:03.791
What does he get,
young Johnson? Two quid a week?

14:03.916 --> 14:09.832
Don't know how he does it. I couldn't afford
to play around with girls at his age.

14:09.957 --> 14:13.707
- Now what's his nibs up to?
- Just practising, Dad.

14:13.832 --> 14:16.624
- I've got a job.
- A job, have you?

14:16.749 --> 14:19.624
I hope it's a good steady one this time.

14:19.749 --> 14:22.291
- That's mine.
- I eat the crusts. I'm slimming.

14:22.416 --> 14:26.832
I told you not to start a new loaf
before you finish the old.

14:26.957 --> 14:29.166
Tell us, how much are you getting?

14:29.291 --> 14:32.957
- I'm getting 30 bob a week.
- Money isn't everything my lad.

14:33.082 --> 14:34.124
What's the prospects?

14:34.249 --> 14:39.249
I wouldn't be surprised if I wasn't given
a very important job to do pretty soon.

14:39.374 --> 14:42.916
- In the government?
- In the CID, if you must know.

14:43.041 --> 14:45.957
Never mind about the job
you're going to get.

14:46.082 --> 14:49.207
- What about the job you've got?
- It's in Covent Garden.

14:49.332 --> 14:51.541
I was recommended
by a detective inspector.

14:51.666 --> 14:54.499
I've got to carry ten baskets on me 'ead.

14:54.624 --> 14:57.791
Well, it's not what I'd call
a real safe job,

14:57.916 --> 15:00.624
but some of these porters
earn good money.

15:00.749 --> 15:02.624
Dad, you know about car numbers?

15:02.749 --> 15:06.832
I'll have a word with Ted Williams.
His son works in the market.

15:06.957 --> 15:10.749
- Why ain't there no cars with GZ?
- I didn't know there wasn't.

15:10.874 --> 15:14.041
It's flowers he goes in for.
Seasonal stuff.

15:14.166 --> 15:17.374
White carnations would go well
with my new dance dress.

15:17.499 --> 15:19.832
Joe, try and get us a couple.

15:19.957 --> 15:23.082
White carnations. I've got
more important things to worry about.

15:23.207 --> 15:24.832
Like joining the CID?

15:24.957 --> 15:26.999
Some people ain't got the imagination.

15:27.124 --> 15:30.291
I done a bit of good
for that detective inspector.

15:30.416 --> 15:34.791
Kept me eyes open and what with this
crime wave, I wouldn't be surprised...

15:34.916 --> 15:37.874
You've got a bit of sausage on your chin.

16:13.332 --> 16:14.457
Joe!

16:16.249 --> 16:18.249
Seen any of the others yet?

16:18.374 --> 16:19.416
No, why?

16:19.541 --> 16:22.166
Roy Ellis ain't half been spinning a yarn.

16:22.291 --> 16:26.041
- I should worry.
- He says they fetched a cop along to you.

16:26.582 --> 16:28.291
Detective Inspector.

16:28.416 --> 16:30.749
Detective Inspector!
Coo, what happened?

16:30.874 --> 16:33.749
Nothing much,
'cept he gave me a job.

16:48.207 --> 16:49.249
Wotcher, Dicky.

16:51.874 --> 16:53.332
Look who's walked in.

16:54.666 --> 16:56.916
Found them bodies yet, Joe?

17:04.124 --> 17:08.124
I Three dead corpses rotting in a box I.

17:08.249 --> 17:12.207
- You should have your brains tested.
- I ...rotting in a box

17:12.332 --> 17:15.540
I And if one dead corpse
should accidentally rot

17:15.665 --> 17:19.457
I There'll be two dead corpses
rotting in a box

17:19.582 --> 17:22.999
I Two dead corpses rotting in a box

17:23.124 --> 17:26.540
I Two dead corpses rotting in a box... I.

17:26.665 --> 17:32.416
Never mind. I bet you gave them cops
the best laugh they've had for years!

17:33.541 --> 17:35.832
I've got two more sets complete, Joe.

17:35.957 --> 17:39.624
Don't talk to him about car numbers.

17:39.749 --> 17:44.457
- I've got all the Xs and Gs.
- You ain't got GZ, Arthur, I know that.

17:44.582 --> 17:47.249
- I have.
- You can't have, there ain't one.

17:48.124 --> 17:49.166
Let's see it.

17:49.291 --> 17:50.332
Where?

17:50.457 --> 17:53.374
There. GZ 4216.

17:53.499 --> 17:55.166
I got it this morning.

18:02.166 --> 18:04.124
You give it back!

18:05.499 --> 18:07.166
Shut up all of ya!

18:08.374 --> 18:09.791
Where d'you see it?

18:09.916 --> 18:13.082
On my way to work,
coming out of the garage.

18:13.207 --> 18:14.541
Why, what's up?

18:14.666 --> 18:15.707
A garage.

18:15.832 --> 18:16.874
It all fits.

18:16.999 --> 18:22.791
It all fits! The van in the story came out
of a garage. They transferred the bodies.

18:22.916 --> 18:25.124
There wasn't any bodies.
You saw that.

18:25.249 --> 18:28.082
- Might mean something else, though.
- What do you mean?

18:28.207 --> 18:31.374
That's right, don't you see?
It's sort of a code.

18:31.499 --> 18:33.416
I bet them furs was stolen.

18:33.957 --> 18:35.541
No, I thought of that.

18:35.666 --> 18:39.666
It can't be. That bloke
wouldn't have dared send for the police.

18:39.791 --> 18:41.166
Why not?

18:41.291 --> 18:44.416
- You pipe down.
- Pipe down yourself. Go on, Clarry.

18:44.541 --> 18:47.541
He took a chance
the cops wouldn't believe Joe.

18:47.666 --> 18:51.041
Now if he goes to 'em again
they'll just laugh.

18:51.166 --> 18:55.374
- He's a crook that bloke in the shop!
- Course he's a crook.

18:55.499 --> 18:59.791
Crooks with a code in a kids' paper
What for anyway?

18:59.916 --> 19:03.416
To get their orders from the boss,
like in the stories.

19:03.541 --> 19:05.749
Why don't the boss just tell 'em?

19:05.874 --> 19:09.332
Because he doesn't want them
to know who he is.

19:09.457 --> 19:10.791
Yes.

19:10.916 --> 19:13.957
Who is he, then?
Feller that owns the paper?

19:14.082 --> 19:16.916
Might be, or the bloke
that writes them stories.

19:17.041 --> 19:18.416
Felix H Wilkinson.

19:18.541 --> 19:19.957
Why not Bing Crosby?

19:20.416 --> 19:22.041
Felix H Wilkinson.

19:23.624 --> 19:24.666
Yeah.

19:26.582 --> 19:29.082
I wonder if he's in the telephone book.

20:20.207 --> 20:22.499
There he is. F H Wilkinson.

20:28.999 --> 20:30.041
Come on.

21:15.291 --> 21:18.582
Your fate is in my hands.

21:27.082 --> 21:28.832
Nothing can save you now.

21:29.332 --> 21:30.374
Nothing.

21:31.541 --> 21:36.291
You're all alone
and I have a silencer on this gun.

21:40.874 --> 21:44.874
You've only got five seconds to live...

21:45.332 --> 21:48.374
'the pistol barked.
A spurt of yellow flame.

21:48.499 --> 21:51.957
'Pike's nostrils were assailed
by the familiar smell, er...

21:52.082 --> 21:54.916
'Correction, aroma.'

21:57.582 --> 22:00.374
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

22:00.499 --> 22:03.332
We... We thought
we was going to be murdered.

22:03.457 --> 22:05.999
The door was open.

22:06.124 --> 22:07.791
Oh!

22:09.999 --> 22:11.749
What a jape, eh?

22:11.874 --> 22:15.166
No, I left the door open for Otto, my cat.

22:15.291 --> 22:17.791
And that's Dick.
Dick the Dictaphone.

22:20.166 --> 22:23.332
Well, look, come in,
come in and sit down.

22:23.874 --> 22:25.457
Just one moment.

22:25.582 --> 22:26.666
There you are.

22:26.791 --> 22:29.041
Well, what... what can I do for you?

22:29.166 --> 22:32.041
Well, sir, we've been reading
that story of yours

22:32.166 --> 22:34.457
about "Mr Pike And The Scarlet Death".

22:34.582 --> 22:35.624
Ah!

22:35.749 --> 22:37.541
My public.

22:37.666 --> 22:41.791
Him being tied to that circular saw
and the poison gas seeping in...

22:41.916 --> 22:45.082
Five more days to find out
if he gets away...

22:45.207 --> 22:48.707
...Smiler when they drop
that black widow spider in the crate...

22:48.832 --> 22:51.207
- We was thinking, Mr Wilkinson...
- You might...

22:51.332 --> 22:52.666
Tell us.

22:53.624 --> 22:55.541
Thank you a thousand times.

22:55.666 --> 22:59.582
This is really the most scrumptious
compliment I've ever been paid.

22:59.707 --> 23:03.082
- You will?
- Of course, by all means.

23:03.207 --> 23:08.957
One moment though, I... think this calls
for a little liquid refreshment, eh?

23:14.999 --> 23:17.832
What's he going to give us?
I don't know.

23:17.957 --> 23:19.874
Sip it careful.

23:19.999 --> 23:21.291
- Hey, Alec!
- What?

23:21.416 --> 23:24.874
- This. "A Study Of Codes And Ciphers".
- Look out!

23:30.332 --> 23:31.374
Ginger pop.

23:34.041 --> 23:36.541
Come along now, fellows, help yourselves.

23:36.666 --> 23:38.582
No, no, no. Not that one!

23:42.041 --> 23:44.374
Mine has, er... gin in it.

23:45.041 --> 23:46.166
Bung ho!

23:48.957 --> 23:50.624
Mmm! Yum, yum, yum.

23:50.749 --> 23:53.749
And now for the answer
to your touching request.

23:53.874 --> 23:56.457
"Selwyn Pike And The Scarlet Death."

23:56.582 --> 23:58.666
Installment number four.

24:00.957 --> 24:02.041
'Crack!

24:02.582 --> 24:05.832
'The sound of the pistol shot
echoed and reverberated

24:05.957 --> 24:08.874
'through the sepulchral darkness
of the lonely mill.

24:09.666 --> 24:16.207
'Selwyn Pike, his neck a bare six inches
from the cruel blades of the whirling saw,

24:16.832 --> 24:20.832
'was aware that something akin to
a miracle had occurred.

24:20.957 --> 24:24.541
'He had told nobody of his plan
to visit Zanzibar Street.'

24:24.666 --> 24:26.166
- Where?
- What?

24:26.291 --> 24:27.957
What is the matter?

24:28.082 --> 24:31.207
The mill where Mr Pike went
was in Lambeth Road.

24:31.332 --> 24:36.249
- I never use real streets in my stories!
- It says Lambeth Road in here.

24:36.374 --> 24:37.416
What?

24:39.166 --> 24:41.957
Oh, crumbs.
What a frightening picture.

24:42.957 --> 24:45.332
So that's what Selwyn Pike looks like.

24:46.166 --> 24:49.207
I say, a bit of a bounder, I'm afraid.

24:49.332 --> 24:51.624
Not at all as I imagined him.

24:51.749 --> 24:54.707
But ain't you never seen
this here paper before?

24:55.291 --> 24:56.582
Gracious me, no.

24:57.082 --> 24:58.832
I create these stories.

24:58.957 --> 25:01.832
Why bless my soul,
you boys are perfectly right.

25:01.957 --> 25:03.374
It is Lambeth Road!

25:03.499 --> 25:06.332
Now, what on earth induced them
to change that?

25:06.457 --> 25:08.416
- Wait.
- Oh!

25:09.041 --> 25:11.999
- And here's a split infinitive.
- Mr Wilkinson...

25:12.124 --> 25:14.707
- And all appearing under my name.
- Mr Wilkinson.

25:14.832 --> 25:17.666
We reckon it's used
as a code by crooks.

25:17.791 --> 25:19.707
I'll never live it... What?

25:19.832 --> 25:21.374
Crooks?

25:21.499 --> 25:22.582
My stories?

25:22.707 --> 25:23.916
That there van.

25:24.041 --> 25:27.332
I've seen it in Great Queen Street,
unloading three crates.

25:27.457 --> 25:29.082
Another boy saw it too!

25:29.207 --> 25:30.416
Here's the addresses.

25:31.499 --> 25:32.874
By the Lord Harry!

25:32.999 --> 25:36.499
Do you mean my stories
have been distorted by some...

25:36.624 --> 25:38.874
- Master criminal.
- Exactly.

25:39.666 --> 25:41.249
Some master criminal,

25:41.916 --> 25:45.332
as a means of sending instructions to his,
er... minions?

25:45.457 --> 25:47.082
Without betraying his own identity.

25:48.916 --> 25:50.791
Stupendous.

25:50.916 --> 25:54.999
Just like Captain X in "Selwyn Pike
And The Footprints On The Ceiling".

25:55.124 --> 25:58.207
He used the agony column
in the "Morning Gazette".

25:58.332 --> 25:59.916
My story.

26:01.207 --> 26:02.624
Let me see that.

26:05.082 --> 26:10.582
"Granville Place, Great Queen Street,
Wilmot Road, Woburn Avenue."

26:10.707 --> 26:14.624
1 from 4 leaves 3,
and 16 and 14...

26:17.249 --> 26:18.957
Ah!

26:21.916 --> 26:23.791
Ah-ha!

26:23.916 --> 26:25.457
Got something, have you?

26:28.374 --> 26:29.541
Yes.

26:29.666 --> 26:31.291
- What is it?
- The key.

26:31.416 --> 26:34.541
The key to your precious code,
the "London Postal Guide".

26:34.666 --> 26:36.624
Granville Place, turn ten pages

26:36.749 --> 26:39.416
and the corresponding position
is Great Queen Street!

26:39.541 --> 26:42.499
Just as I thought,
with two, three, four added.

26:42.624 --> 26:45.749
- How do you work that out?
- Well may you ask.

26:45.874 --> 26:48.457
The scoundrels have purloined
the code I invented

26:48.582 --> 26:52.166
for "The Case Of The Limping Skeleton",
the child of this brain!

26:52.291 --> 26:55.207
- Who's going to tell the police?
- The police?

26:55.332 --> 26:56.749
Yeah, the cops.

26:59.332 --> 27:02.207
- Tell the police!
- What's the matter?

27:02.332 --> 27:03.374
Huh.

27:03.499 --> 27:04.666
Well...

27:04.791 --> 27:07.999
This is a big powerful gang
we've stumbled on!

27:08.124 --> 27:13.041
They would never show a shred of mercy
on anyone who... peached on them.

27:13.166 --> 27:16.541
- But if they all get arrested.
- Some may get away.

27:17.166 --> 27:21.541
And they'll be sure to avenge
their comrades, ruffians of that breed,

27:22.207 --> 27:25.541
like the survivors in
"The Case Of The Crowded Coffins".

27:25.666 --> 27:29.332
They reappeared literally from the grave,

27:29.457 --> 27:33.332
to out the throat
of poor old Silas Cobleigh.

27:33.457 --> 27:35.707
- See here, Mr Wilkinson...
- And remember.

27:35.832 --> 27:40.291
Remember what happened to Nicky the Nark
in "The Case Of The Creeping Death".

27:40.416 --> 27:43.582
Yeah, but those sort of things
only happen in stories.

27:43.707 --> 27:47.291
Are you suggesting that stories
can never come to life?

27:49.582 --> 27:51.332
Look, don't be rash, boys.

27:51.832 --> 27:55.957
Leave me out of it, I implore you.
Leave me out of it.

27:56.082 --> 27:59.166
I want no part of it at all!

27:59.666 --> 28:00.999
Ah.

28:01.916 --> 28:03.124
Otto.

28:03.791 --> 28:06.499
Come... Otto.

28:07.957 --> 28:09.332
Boys.

28:10.249 --> 28:12.749
Don't forget Nicky the Nark.

28:30.541 --> 28:31.874
Morning, Harry. Nice weather.

28:31.999 --> 28:34.291
Wotcher, mind your backs please!
Yoi-yoi!

28:34.416 --> 28:35.457
Yoi-yoi!

28:36.541 --> 28:37.624
Oi-Oi!

28:38.332 --> 28:39.374
Oi-Oi!

28:40.749 --> 28:42.082
Mind your backs, please.

28:43.916 --> 28:44.957
Oi-oi.

28:49.541 --> 28:50.582
Joe!

28:53.457 --> 28:56.624
I've just been telling the inspector
about your latest findings

28:56.749 --> 28:59.582
and, er... he'd like to
have a word with you.

28:59.707 --> 29:00.957
What's the idea, son?

29:01.082 --> 29:04.207
I thought I'd done you a good turn.

29:04.332 --> 29:05.374
You have too.

29:05.499 --> 29:08.332
Then why do you keep on wasting my time?

29:08.457 --> 29:11.166
All this nonsense about crooks and codes.

29:11.291 --> 29:12.874
But it ain't nonsense, Inspector.

29:12.999 --> 29:16.249
There's a racket being worked.
Here's the codes they're using.

29:16.374 --> 29:18.874
Check that out
with the "London Postal Guide"

29:18.999 --> 29:21.499
and have a look at this story too.

29:21.624 --> 29:23.499
Did you make this code up?

29:23.624 --> 29:26.332
- Me? No, course I didn't.
- Who did?

29:28.332 --> 29:30.249
Who made up this code?

29:31.499 --> 29:35.124
- It was in a story in the "Trump".
- I thought so.

29:35.249 --> 29:38.374
- I've just about had enough of this.
- I ain't sprucing!

29:38.499 --> 29:41.666
It was in "The Case Of
The Limping Skeleton".

29:41.791 --> 29:42.999
Cut it out!

29:43.624 --> 29:45.874
I've been very patient with you,

29:45.999 --> 29:49.041
but you're going to
get into serious trouble.

29:49.166 --> 29:53.374
The next time I come here
it won't be simply to warn you.

29:58.124 --> 30:00.124
You believe me don't you, guv?

30:00.249 --> 30:01.499
Yeah.

30:01.624 --> 30:03.707
Sure, Joe. Sure.

30:03.832 --> 30:05.332
I believe you.

30:07.416 --> 30:09.791
I even believe in Santa Claus.

30:44.541 --> 30:46.749
Can I carry your bag, Miss Davis?

30:46.874 --> 30:49.166
No thank you, Norman, dear.

30:50.541 --> 30:52.749
Do you work on the "Trump", mate?

30:58.707 --> 31:01.999
- Do you work on the "Trump", mate?
- Yeah, why?

31:02.666 --> 31:05.499
Have you got a date with her or something?

31:05.624 --> 31:08.374
No, sometimes we go the same way, see.

31:09.749 --> 31:11.499
Why? What do you want?

31:11.624 --> 31:15.374
- A peek at next week's story in advance.
- You ain't asking much.

31:15.499 --> 31:17.707
Wait till you've heard what I know.

31:21.707 --> 31:24.541
I reckon Joe ought to
have his head examined,

31:24.666 --> 31:26.874
blowing the gaff to some Camberwell kid.

31:26.999 --> 31:28.624
And bringing him along here.

31:28.749 --> 31:31.582
How else could we find
who's changing the stories?

31:31.707 --> 31:32.999
We'd be proper stuck.

31:33.124 --> 31:36.499
For all we know,
that kid's in the racket hisself.

31:36.624 --> 31:38.582
Joe says he's all right.

31:38.707 --> 31:41.374
Did I ask you?
We don't want you.

31:41.499 --> 31:43.541
- Who said so?
- I said so!

31:46.124 --> 31:47.166
Here they come.

31:57.624 --> 31:59.499
Blimey, dapper little beggar, ain't he?

31:59.624 --> 32:04.416
I say, what a
shocking place to bring a fellow to!

32:04.541 --> 32:08.791
Turn it up, Roy. This is him, fellers.
Norman Pelley.

32:10.624 --> 32:11.666
Come on.

32:11.791 --> 32:13.791
Who's the crook on your paper?

32:15.707 --> 32:17.749
Be nice to know, wouldn't it?

32:17.874 --> 32:20.707
There's no one at the office
altering them stories.

32:20.832 --> 32:23.957
I made sure.
And it can't be the comps.

32:24.082 --> 32:28.374
- That means the printers.
- And Joe said it couldn't be Wilkinson.

32:28.499 --> 32:32.457
- Now who are we left with?
- It doesn't matter about that now.

32:32.582 --> 32:34.916
We've got next week's paper.

32:35.041 --> 32:37.249
- He gave it to me.
- In code?

32:37.374 --> 32:39.874
- We worked it out.
- Ls there a job?

32:39.999 --> 32:42.707
Them crooks are going to
bust into Ritchie's.

32:42.832 --> 32:44.166
In the West End?

32:44.291 --> 32:46.582
What, that big place in Oxford Street?

32:47.874 --> 32:51.041
That's it. Ritchie's, the big
department store in Oxford Circus.

32:51.166 --> 32:53.791
- Get out!
- How does the next bit start?

32:53.916 --> 32:57.666
- Buzz off, this ain't no reading circle.
- Get on with it, then.

32:57.791 --> 32:59.666
There's Tattoo Jack and his gang

32:59.791 --> 33:03.166
and they're going to break in,
eight o'clock tomorrow night.

33:03.291 --> 33:06.916
Thanks to Norman, we've got
half a day's start to plan.

33:07.041 --> 33:09.874
They won't get a dekko at this
until tomorrow morning.

33:21.207 --> 33:22.499
Boxing.

33:41.457 --> 33:45.124
"It was apparent to Smiler

33:45.249 --> 33:47.207
"that he had been... misled

33:47.332 --> 33:52.082
"for... the newcomer...
was... Tattoo Jack!"

33:52.207 --> 33:53.249
Right.

33:53.374 --> 33:58.082
That's all we want to know.
Tattoo Jack is doing the job this week.

33:58.207 --> 34:00.041
Working tonight, dear?

34:00.166 --> 34:04.332
- No, not me. Tattoo Jack.
- Good, we can go to the pictures.

34:05.041 --> 34:06.624
OK, boys.

34:06.749 --> 34:08.041
We're running tonight.

34:08.166 --> 34:11.041
- Why? Who's doing the job?
- Tattoo Jack.

34:11.166 --> 34:12.498
Must be something special.

34:19.916 --> 34:21.498
Detective Sergeant Fothergill.

34:22.581 --> 34:23.623
Who?

34:24.373 --> 34:25.416
I see.

34:25.541 --> 34:26.581
Carry on.

34:27.373 --> 34:28.416
Maclean.

34:29.748 --> 34:31.166
This evening?

34:31.291 --> 34:34.206
Do you mean Ritchie's at Oxford Circus?

34:34.331 --> 34:35.373
Yes.

34:35.873 --> 34:38.916
Yes, thanks for the tip.
We'll follow that up.

34:39.706 --> 34:41.831
- Wallis, Meadows.
- Sergeant?

34:41.956 --> 34:43.831
Anonymous tip-off, for what it's worth.

34:43.956 --> 34:47.081
- Possible job at Ritchie's.
- Do you want us to go?

34:47.206 --> 34:49.456
Yes, I'll come with you.
Eight o'clock.

34:49.581 --> 34:52.956
- Any idea who?
- Bunch of kids, so the nark said.

35:04.832 --> 35:06.791
- Detective Sergeant Fothergill.
- OK, sir.

36:47.916 --> 36:50.499
'Six stone, two pounds.'

36:55.624 --> 36:57.749
'17 stone, 4 pounds.'

37:06.874 --> 37:09.124
'30 stone, 5 pounds.'

37:10.624 --> 37:12.082
'40 stone.'

37:12.999 --> 37:14.499
'40 stone.'

37:14.624 --> 37:16.374
'40 stone.'

37:16.499 --> 37:18.291
'40...stone.'

37:19.291 --> 37:21.166
'...40...stone.'

37:24.666 --> 37:28.874
- Come 'ere!
- Dicky, help me!

37:28.999 --> 37:30.707
I've got him!

37:30.832 --> 37:32.416
Oi! Come on!

37:37.416 --> 37:38.832
Keep hold of him!

37:38.957 --> 37:40.332
In here!

37:40.457 --> 37:42.374
'Ere, get off me!

37:45.374 --> 37:47.582
Get him, Joe!

37:48.249 --> 37:49.749
Let me go! Ow!

37:49.874 --> 37:51.499
Lay off! Stop it!

37:53.207 --> 37:54.957
Get hold of him!

37:55.082 --> 37:56.666
That net there! Come on.

38:00.041 --> 38:02.082
Joe, get him on the floor.

38:05.457 --> 38:06.916
Oi, get down!

38:14.791 --> 38:17.291
Let me out of here, please!

38:17.416 --> 38:19.707
Help, help!

38:19.832 --> 38:20.874
Help!

38:23.624 --> 38:24.999
- What's up?
- Kids!

38:25.124 --> 38:29.749
Big kids, little kids, tough kids,
thousands of them all over the place!

38:35.707 --> 38:38.791
- Let me go!
- Hey!

38:38.916 --> 38:40.291
What's going on here?

38:40.416 --> 38:44.332
Here y'are, we caught the lot.

38:45.166 --> 38:47.666
- Phillips!
- Sergeant Fothergill!

38:48.457 --> 38:51.916
Don't stand there gaping, man!
Get us out of this!

38:52.041 --> 38:53.374
Beat it, beat it!

38:53.499 --> 38:55.124
Beat it, out that way!

38:57.166 --> 38:58.541
Come here!

38:59.582 --> 39:02.707
- Right, Sergeant.
- We've got them trapped!

39:02.832 --> 39:05.457
For Pete's sake, get me out of this!

39:11.666 --> 39:13.291
We're done for.

39:13.416 --> 39:14.832
Oi, come 'ere, quick!

39:16.249 --> 39:19.832
- Give us help. Anybody got a torch?
- I've got one, Roy.

39:22.791 --> 39:24.707
Last one put the lid back.

39:26.749 --> 39:29.541
Get down there
before the cops come!

39:29.666 --> 39:31.541
- Come on!
- Get down there!

40:03.457 --> 40:07.499
- Coo, don't it pong.
- What do you expect in a sewer? Violets?

40:10.249 --> 40:12.124
This is where my dad works.

40:15.624 --> 40:17.499
Where do we go from here?

40:17.624 --> 40:20.249
Where do you want to go?
Piccadilly? Strand?

40:20.374 --> 40:22.332
They run just like the streets.

40:23.541 --> 40:24.832
Well, come on.

40:48.166 --> 40:51.666
They can't have got out this way.
They must be somewhere.

40:51.791 --> 40:53.666
Might have doubled back inside, sir.

40:53.791 --> 40:57.249
Take a look round the basement.
I'll try the furnace room.

40:57.374 --> 41:01.457
Get on the blower
and warn the patrol oar to keep a lookout.

41:01.582 --> 41:02.832
You come with me.

41:57.041 --> 41:59.666
- Here it is!
- Hurray!

41:59.791 --> 42:01.416
Good old Roy!

42:11.541 --> 42:13.249
- What's up?
- It's stiff.

42:25.374 --> 42:26.624
It's no use.

42:32.416 --> 42:34.124
We'd better find another one.

42:41.374 --> 42:42.957
It's all right, Alec.

42:43.499 --> 42:45.457
We'll get out, won't we Joe?

42:45.582 --> 42:46.624
What?

42:46.749 --> 42:48.124
Oh, sure.

42:48.707 --> 42:49.749
Come on.

43:01.374 --> 43:04.582
I can't go on, I can't go on, I can't!

43:04.707 --> 43:07.249
- It won't be for long, Alec.
- I can't!

43:07.374 --> 43:08.916
I can't, I can't!

43:08.999 --> 43:10.999
I can't, I can't!

43:13.374 --> 43:14.999
Shut up, all of you!

43:17.582 --> 43:20.416
- Let's have a go at it.
- It's no use.

43:26.916 --> 43:28.749
'FY calling 12A.

43:28.874 --> 43:31.624
'Oxford Circus, vicinity of Ritchie's.

43:32.207 --> 43:33.541
'Number of boys seen '

43:44.582 --> 43:45.999
Cor, fresh air.

44:05.457 --> 44:08.332
My mum didn't half go off the deep end.

44:08.457 --> 44:11.582
I told my old man I rescued a kid from the
canal.

44:11.707 --> 44:14.999
- Did he believe you?
- Dunno. He clouted me.

44:15.124 --> 44:17.999
They can't send me to borstal,
I'm too young.

44:18.124 --> 44:20.624
Oh, shut up. Nobody is going to borstal.

44:20.749 --> 44:23.582
Break into a West End store,
beat up the watchman,

44:23.707 --> 44:27.166
tie down the cops
and expect to get away with it?

44:27.291 --> 44:30.541
- Don't make me laugh.
- How're they going to know?

44:30.666 --> 44:32.582
Don't take any notice, Joe.

44:32.707 --> 44:36.291
Them coppers wasn't after us,
they was after the crooks.

44:36.416 --> 44:39.249
- Then why didn't the crooks turn up?
- Joe!

44:39.374 --> 44:40.416
Joe!

44:40.541 --> 44:44.249
There's a couple of coppers
standing round by the ruins.

44:44.832 --> 44:46.416
I did, I see 'em!

44:46.541 --> 44:51.124
What did I tell you?
Come on, I'm getting out of here quick.

44:51.249 --> 44:52.749
Where's that water?

44:52.874 --> 44:57.416
- You going, Roy? Where you going?
- Any place'd be healthier than here.

44:57.541 --> 45:01.999
- Why don't they come here and get us, eh?
- Figure that out for yourself.

45:02.124 --> 45:04.624
That Camberwell pal of yours is a nark.

45:04.749 --> 45:08.207
- He knows about the ruins, don't he?
- The dirty little rat.

45:09.291 --> 45:13.666
- What are we going to do?
- What are we going to do?

45:15.207 --> 45:17.582
If we could find them crooks...

45:17.707 --> 45:20.541
Or maybe we ought to go to the police.

45:22.457 --> 45:23.999
Shove it down there, Dicky.

45:24.166 --> 45:26.374
- Out of the way.
- Who you shoving?

45:26.499 --> 45:28.416
Take your fancy ideas somewhere else.

45:34.999 --> 45:36.207
Hit him!

45:38.791 --> 45:40.749
Come on, Joe!

45:41.832 --> 45:42.957
Hit him, Joe!

45:43.082 --> 45:45.791
Dicky, you bring that bowl back,
this minute.

45:45.916 --> 45:50.874
Go on, bash him, bash him!

45:53.082 --> 45:55.291
Blimey, look who's here!

45:55.416 --> 45:56.957
Norman the nark!

45:57.499 --> 45:59.207
Joe!

45:59.332 --> 46:01.207
Hey, fellers, turn it up!

46:01.791 --> 46:03.332
Joe!

46:03.916 --> 46:07.707
- Norman! What's up?
- I've got a clue. I've seen Wilkinson.

46:07.832 --> 46:09.124
- You have?
- Yeah.

46:09.249 --> 46:12.374
- My boss wanted the story early.
- Did you get it?

46:12.499 --> 46:13.874
- Lap it up.
- No.

46:13.999 --> 46:18.999
Wilkinson says he posted it last night,
he always puts it in the post on Sundays.

46:19.124 --> 46:23.207
- So what?
- We don't ever get it before Tuesday.

46:24.541 --> 46:26.749
- Are you sure of that, Norman?
- Course.

46:26.874 --> 46:30.999
Miss Davis opens it
and I take it to the old man.

46:31.124 --> 46:35.124
- Miss Davis. Does she open all letters?
- Yes, but she's all right.

46:35.249 --> 46:37.457
- Not so fast...
- It can't be her.

46:37.582 --> 46:39.707
- Is she good-looking?
- She's a smasher.

46:40.832 --> 46:43.332
'Ere, come off it.
What's the idea?

46:43.457 --> 46:46.291
- I swear...
- How do you reckon she works it?

46:46.416 --> 46:49.874
Supposing she puts the story
in her pocket first thing Monday.

46:49.999 --> 46:55.124
She can take it home, muck it about
and send it back by last post.

46:55.249 --> 46:56.832
I'll bet ya that's it!

46:57.332 --> 47:00.916
- That dirty, double crossing...
- Now we've got to get some evidence.

47:00.999 --> 47:02.082
He's off again.

47:02.207 --> 47:03.832
It's our big chance, Alec.

47:03.957 --> 47:07.416
If we can find them crooks,
we don't have to worry.

47:07.541 --> 47:10.374
- Where does this bird live, Norman?
- Hampstead way somewhere.

47:10.499 --> 47:13.457
- I'll try and find out.
- Might make her suspicious.

47:13.582 --> 47:15.499
- We'll trail her.
- Six o'clock tomorrow.

47:15.624 --> 47:18.999
- Yeah.
- Biggest load of bull I've ever heard.

47:20.999 --> 47:22.416
Poor old Roy.

47:22.541 --> 47:24.541
He don't finish work until seven.

47:27.332 --> 47:30.957
- Coming on my bus, Miss Davis?
- Yes, Norman, I am tonight.

47:43.582 --> 47:46.332
Hurry along, hurry along, please!
One more only.

47:48.416 --> 47:52.666
Oh no, you go, Norman.
You've got further to go than me.

47:56.332 --> 47:59.332
- What did you do that for?
- Where's she gone?

47:59.457 --> 48:01.957
- We've lost her now.
- I couldn't help it.

48:02.082 --> 48:04.707
- That's a fine thing!
- Let's get off.

48:04.832 --> 48:06.999
It's no use yelping, get off quick.

48:09.749 --> 48:11.291
- Look out!
- Watch out!

48:11.416 --> 48:14.416
Across the road, fellers,
hurry up!

48:19.166 --> 48:20.332
There she is.

49:31.791 --> 49:32.832
Taxi!

49:32.957 --> 49:34.499
Taxi! Taxi, oi!

49:34.624 --> 49:35.666
Taxi!

49:37.749 --> 49:38.999
Hey, taxi!

49:42.707 --> 49:44.457
Hey, taxi!

49:45.124 --> 49:46.166
Taxi!

49:49.249 --> 49:51.416
- Taxi!
- Taxi!

49:51.541 --> 49:52.749
Taxi!

50:02.707 --> 50:03.832
That's torn it.

50:03.957 --> 50:07.999
- No it hasn't, we'll take a bus.
- Where to, you silly little shrimp?

50:08.166 --> 50:10.374
Number 31, Moyne Road.

50:10.499 --> 50:12.749
That's where the lady told the driver.

50:12.874 --> 50:14.916
I was holding the taxi door.

50:14.999 --> 50:16.249
Cor!

50:16.374 --> 50:17.416
Good old Alec!

50:17.541 --> 50:18.582
Come on!

50:46.166 --> 50:47.666
Shh!

50:53.707 --> 50:55.124
Go on, Alec.

51:15.374 --> 51:16.999
What do you want here?

51:17.624 --> 51:20.499
Can you spare something
for the choir outing?

51:20.624 --> 51:21.832
What choir?

51:22.374 --> 51:24.207
St Mark's, Miss.

51:24.332 --> 51:26.916
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

51:26.999 --> 51:28.957
I don't know.

51:30.499 --> 51:32.749
I expect you've seen me in church.

51:37.874 --> 51:42.291
Ah yes, that must be it.
Come along in, clear. I'll get my bag.

51:42.416 --> 51:45.166
I want to tell you about the outing.

51:45.291 --> 51:47.791
- You shall. Come along.
- No, I'll stop here.

51:47.916 --> 51:49.791
Oh no you won't.

51:51.749 --> 51:53.999
This was the one they use.

51:54.124 --> 51:55.874
- We've got her.
- Look out!

51:58.916 --> 52:00.624
I get it.

52:00.749 --> 52:02.374
I thought as much.

52:03.999 --> 52:06.666
We'll see what the police have to say.

52:08.124 --> 52:11.457
- Good old Dicky!
- Round the chair, Dicky!

52:11.582 --> 52:13.207
I'll break your necks!

52:13.332 --> 52:15.624
Lay off, will you? Cut it out!

52:15.749 --> 52:18.499
You'll get five years and the cat!

52:18.624 --> 52:21.082
Take your filthy paws off me.

52:24.082 --> 52:29.082
Well, what happens now?

52:34.332 --> 52:35.624
What now, Joe?

52:45.082 --> 52:48.291
Don't you think
you're going to get away with this.

52:55.999 --> 52:57.166
What's happened?

52:58.124 --> 52:59.582
We've tied her up.

53:01.332 --> 53:02.624
What?

53:05.124 --> 53:07.374
Here, quick. Have a look at this.

53:08.166 --> 53:10.707
Was them stories done on the same machine?

53:10.832 --> 53:12.124
I don't know.

53:14.207 --> 53:16.374
Supposing she's seen me with you.

53:16.499 --> 53:20.249
- What am I going to say to her?
- She won't be there.

53:20.374 --> 53:24.457
- You can talk, I've got a job to lose.
- What's that bird's name?

53:24.582 --> 53:25.916
Her? Rhona Davis.

53:25.999 --> 53:28.832
Why is this addressed to
Miss Rhona Watson?

53:28.957 --> 53:32.082
Why don't she use her right name
at your office?

53:32.207 --> 53:36.916
I'm going to ring my boss and tell him
we're really on to something.

53:36.999 --> 53:40.999
- That's right, come on!
- Dicky, Alec, watch her, make her talk!

53:41.124 --> 53:42.832
You get back on guard!

53:48.499 --> 53:50.541
Do we go back in there?

53:50.666 --> 53:52.457
You heard what he said.

53:53.707 --> 53:55.707
We've got to make her talk.

53:55.832 --> 53:57.374
Couldn't we tickle her?

53:57.999 --> 53:59.416
Don't talk silly.

53:59.541 --> 54:02.999
But it worked fine in "The Case Of
The Cross-Eyed Chinaman".

54:04.957 --> 54:07.166
No guv, I'm in a call box.

54:07.291 --> 54:10.291
Speedwell 9446, it's about
two minutes from her place.

54:10.416 --> 54:15.457
I'm going to ring up Inspector Ford.
Stop where you are and I'll call you back.

54:15.582 --> 54:19.832
They'll be OK. You stick where you are
and don't leave that box.

54:19.957 --> 54:21.249
Good lad.

54:22.332 --> 54:23.374
Hello.

54:23.874 --> 54:25.207
Hello, Exchange.

54:25.332 --> 54:26.374
Hello?

54:26.832 --> 54:29.957
You're going to talk
if I stay here all night!

54:31.207 --> 54:32.749
Who's your boss?

54:36.999 --> 54:38.999
I'll scar you for life!

54:39.124 --> 54:41.666
Oh, why don't you go home to Mother?

54:45.249 --> 54:47.874
And you too, you silly little squirt.

54:50.707 --> 54:54.957
I don't know,
it made Old Ming Po talk all right.

54:55.082 --> 54:58.999
Go off to your pals.
They knew what was good for them.

54:59.166 --> 55:01.374
They left you to carry the can.

55:01.499 --> 55:05.749
I wouldn't like to be in your shoes
when my pals turn up.

55:06.541 --> 55:07.749
Alec, come here.

55:08.249 --> 55:11.707
They won't be long now,
I'm expecting them any minute.

55:12.457 --> 55:13.916
Water torture.

55:13.999 --> 55:17.166
Then you'll know
what it means to be tough.

55:28.707 --> 55:30.082
Get it away!

55:30.207 --> 55:31.916
- Stop it.
- Take it away!

55:31.999 --> 55:35.082
- Do you want to talk?
- Yes, yes!

55:39.791 --> 55:43.582
- OK, who runs your racket?
- It's...

55:43.707 --> 55:44.832
Donald Duck.

55:51.666 --> 55:54.291
- You there, undo those cords.
- Yes, sir.

56:06.082 --> 56:07.457
Get a move on.

56:07.582 --> 56:09.624
Hurry, hurry, come on.

56:13.332 --> 56:14.374
Got him!

56:23.707 --> 56:24.999
- Joe, Joe!
- What's happened?

56:25.124 --> 56:27.624
- A bloke turned up.
- One of the crooks.

56:27.749 --> 56:30.291
I knocked him cold.
Dicky's tied him up.

56:30.416 --> 56:32.541
Lovely grub. That'll show Ford.

56:32.666 --> 56:38.624
- Nightingale is trying to contact him.
- We're not going to wait now, are we?

56:38.749 --> 56:42.249
Well, I don't know
He told me not to move.

56:42.374 --> 56:46.457
You gave him the address,
he'll find his way all right, come on!

56:54.541 --> 56:55.957
Look!

57:15.416 --> 57:16.916
Oh, they've got Dicky!

57:27.374 --> 57:30.207
We'll never see him again,
I know we won't.

57:30.332 --> 57:32.957
He might have run for it.

57:33.082 --> 57:35.582
We never ought to have left him.

57:35.707 --> 57:37.832
They'll find him in the river.

57:37.957 --> 57:39.332
Nark it, can't ya?

57:39.457 --> 57:40.791
Get a move on!

58:08.416 --> 58:09.999
Who's going to tell her?

58:10.749 --> 58:12.291
Joe, I suppose.

58:13.291 --> 58:15.541
You don't think it's a woman's job?

58:15.666 --> 58:17.999
- She don't like me.
- She hates me.

58:24.999 --> 58:25.999
Hey, Joe!

58:26.166 --> 58:27.457
Dicky!

58:27.582 --> 58:30.999
I got in the back of their car!

58:31.166 --> 58:34.457
They're packing up,
getting all their stuff out of London.

58:34.582 --> 58:36.916
- We thought you were dead.
- Pipe down.

58:36.999 --> 58:39.166
King's Cross, that's where they went.

58:39.291 --> 58:42.249
The bloke I tied up's gone to Glasgow.

58:42.374 --> 58:43.957
Where've they got the stuff?

58:44.082 --> 58:47.124
I know where they're shifting it.
Ballard's Wharf.

58:47.249 --> 58:50.457
Cor, if you'd have seen me
crouching there beside them...

58:50.582 --> 58:54.207
Here, what's all this?
I might have known it.

58:54.332 --> 58:57.999
You ought to be ashamed of yourself
hanging round the streets!

58:58.124 --> 58:59.791
Grr, the old mare!

58:59.916 --> 59:01.457
Don't bother about her.

59:02.541 --> 59:04.457
Ballard's Wharf.

59:06.999 --> 59:10.499
How many crooks' names
do you remember out of the "Trump"?

59:10.624 --> 59:11.832
Forget the "Trump".

59:11.957 --> 59:15.666
- What's Ford going to do?
- I've got a big idea.

59:15.791 --> 59:18.124
- Again?
- Give him a chance, Norman.

59:18.249 --> 59:20.624
Larry the Bull and Slimy Sam.

59:20.749 --> 59:24.916
Holy Noakes and Chopper Wilson
that used to bump off blondes.

59:24.999 --> 59:26.166
Come on, Norman.

59:26.291 --> 59:27.666
Poplar Pete.

59:27.791 --> 59:31.249
He tried to chuck Selwyn Pike
into a bath of acid.

59:31.832 --> 59:33.082
What is this idea?

59:33.207 --> 59:36.957
Benjamin Cutler, Eddie The Moose
and Smoky Andrews.

59:37.082 --> 59:41.624
He tried to plug Smiley with a poisoned
dart in "Death Comes At Midnight".

59:41.749 --> 59:43.499
Smoky Andrews.

59:44.291 --> 59:47.999
Ford will have to believe us
if we round up this lot.

59:49.082 --> 59:50.582
Us round 'em up?

59:50.707 --> 59:52.707
Us and a lot of others.

59:52.832 --> 59:56.916
Listen, the heads know the game's up, see.
But the other blokes don't.

59:56.999 --> 59:59.582
They'll be looking
in their "Trump" next week.

59:59.707 --> 01:00:00.832
For their orders.

01:00:00.957 --> 01:00:01.999
That's it.

01:00:02.124 --> 01:00:05.624
Listen, could you pinch Wilkinson's story
out of the post tomorrow?

01:00:05.749 --> 01:00:08.874
- Same as Rhona used to?
- I suppose I can, but...

01:00:08.999 --> 01:00:10.874
You've got nothing to worry about.

01:00:10.999 --> 01:00:13.499
There'll be another story along
at your office.

01:00:13.624 --> 01:00:15.832
- Are you going to write it?
- Me?

01:00:16.457 --> 01:00:17.707
No.

01:00:18.416 --> 01:00:20.791
No, I won't do it.

01:00:20.916 --> 01:00:22.457
It's asking too much.

01:00:22.582 --> 01:00:25.166
I won't even consider it.

01:00:25.291 --> 01:00:30.082
Then I'll have to let them crooks know
you put us on to their code.

01:00:30.207 --> 01:00:32.666
- This is blackmail.
- That's right.

01:00:32.791 --> 01:00:37.874
But if you write the story the way
I've asked, no one would even know.

01:00:39.416 --> 01:00:41.332
Such base ingratitude.

01:00:42.374 --> 01:00:46.166
Larry the Bull, Slimy Sam, Chopper
Do you want them all included?

01:00:46.291 --> 01:00:48.999
Yes, and don't forget the password,
"Seagull".

01:00:50.707 --> 01:00:53.832
- When do you want this done?
- First thing.

01:00:53.957 --> 01:00:57.707
I've never written a story of this length
in under two days!

01:00:57.832 --> 01:00:59.749
You'll have to bust your record.

01:00:59.874 --> 01:01:02.082
Remember what happened to Nicky the Nark.

01:01:06.791 --> 01:01:09.082
It'll mean missing all my sleep.

01:01:10.207 --> 01:01:11.707
But all of it.

01:01:13.707 --> 01:01:19.749
Oh, howl loathe
adventurous-minded boys.

01:01:32.291 --> 01:01:33.999
<i>Guvnor, what happened?</i>

01:01:34.124 --> 01:01:38.207
Did he create? There was a bloke,
came and rescued 'em. If you'd...

01:01:38.332 --> 01:01:41.166
Give us a chance.
Do you mean last night?

01:01:41.291 --> 01:01:44.916
Yes. Inspector Ford.
Was he wild when he found them gone?

01:01:44.999 --> 01:01:48.499
- He was Joe, pretty wild.
- He's going to be thanking us.

01:01:48.624 --> 01:01:53.332
- I think we are on to the boss.
- You're onto the boss of the gang?

01:01:53.457 --> 01:01:56.624
I reckon he got the others out.

01:01:56.749 --> 01:02:01.749
I don't know 'is name yet, but I've got
the number of his car, EMU 20.

01:02:01.874 --> 01:02:03.499
Carry on, this is interesting.

01:02:03.624 --> 01:02:06.541
I know where he's putting
that stuff he pinched.

01:02:06.666 --> 01:02:08.249
- How?
- A pal of mine.

01:02:08.374 --> 01:02:10.124
- Not bad, eh?
- Very smart.

01:02:10.249 --> 01:02:14.624
I don't know if you'll be able to
get on to Inspector Ford again.

01:02:14.749 --> 01:02:17.582
- He won't believe it?
- After last night, of course.

01:02:17.707 --> 01:02:22.457
- He will once we round up the gang.
- What have you got in mind?

01:02:22.582 --> 01:02:25.541
The boss is moving his swag
to Ballard's Wharf,

01:02:25.666 --> 01:02:28.541
so we're having a special story
in the "Trump",

01:02:28.666 --> 01:02:30.666
telling the others to pinch it.

01:02:30.791 --> 01:02:32.916
And you catch them red-handed?

01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:36.957
That's the idea. Making a real big do
of it, Saturday afternoon.

01:02:37.082 --> 01:02:39.332
- Reckon it'll work?
- I'm sure it'll work.

01:02:39.457 --> 01:02:41.332
I'm sure it'll work a treat.

01:02:41.457 --> 01:02:44.082
- The Battle of Ballard's Wharf.
- Yeah.

01:02:56.999 --> 01:02:57.999
Guv!

01:02:59.707 --> 01:03:01.166
Guv'nor!

01:03:01.291 --> 01:03:02.416
Guv'nor!

01:03:02.541 --> 01:03:03.582
Guv!

01:03:19.291 --> 01:03:23.082
"Never had there been
such an assembly of desperados

01:03:23.207 --> 01:03:25.499
"as met on the Saturday afternoon."

01:03:26.791 --> 01:03:31.332
"Thieves, kidnappers, stick-up men,
blackmailers, bullies, murderers..."

01:03:33.624 --> 01:03:36.374
"...all listened eagerly,
their villainous faces aglow,

01:03:36.499 --> 01:03:39.666
"as Larry the Bull
outlined his evil plan."

01:03:43.457 --> 01:03:46.832
"'That kid, Smiler, ' announced Larry
with a triumphant grin,

01:03:46.957 --> 01:03:51.416
"'has played right into our hands.
He's led us all unwitting to the plunder.

01:03:51.541 --> 01:03:54.374
"'Let us hie forthwith to number 401,
Crampton Street..."'

01:03:54.499 --> 01:03:56.499
What? Let me see that.

01:03:56.624 --> 01:03:58.582
- Why, what's the matter?
- Those little...

01:03:58.707 --> 01:04:02.499
That's the code for my place,
not Ballard's Wharf. They've found out.

01:04:02.624 --> 01:04:04.666
- What?
- Heavens, don't be so dumb.

01:04:04.791 --> 01:04:07.666
That I never shifted the stuff
to the wharf.

01:04:07.791 --> 01:04:10.332
They're sending all our chaps
to my warehouse.

01:04:10.457 --> 01:04:13.957
- What will you do? What about me?
- Oh.

01:06:08.874 --> 01:06:10.916
Working overtime eh, Joe?

01:06:20.541 --> 01:06:21.916
Where are the others?

01:06:21.999 --> 01:06:23.666
Your pals.

01:06:34.541 --> 01:06:36.166
No use you holding out.

01:06:36.291 --> 01:06:38.791
I've just been reading my "Trump".

01:06:50.916 --> 01:06:52.416
Where are they, Joe?

01:06:54.291 --> 01:06:55.582
Ballard's Wharf.

01:06:56.457 --> 01:06:59.957
Now, now. What's the good of you
telling me lies?

01:07:01.457 --> 01:07:03.499
I know you've changed the story.

01:07:03.624 --> 01:07:04.999
They're at Ballard's Wharf.

01:07:05.124 --> 01:07:08.499
- For the last time...
- I'm telling you, at Ballard's Wharf.

01:07:08.624 --> 01:07:13.791
To catch them with the stuff, we told them
to fetch it and take it there.

01:07:13.916 --> 01:07:15.082
I see.

01:07:15.207 --> 01:07:18.291
Well, I didn't get that far in the story.

01:07:18.416 --> 01:07:20.999
So, you and I are all alone, eh?

01:07:21.166 --> 01:07:22.499
That's fine.

01:07:23.082 --> 01:07:25.916
- You've taken a tip from me, eh?
- I have?

01:07:25.999 --> 01:07:30.416
Sure. I put a phony story in
the "Trump" to catch you, didn't I?

01:07:30.541 --> 01:07:34.082
Sent you to Ritchie's,
but you were too smart for me

01:07:34.207 --> 01:07:36.791
and now I've been too smart for you.

01:07:36.916 --> 01:07:39.666
Wise move of mine,
getting you working here.

01:07:40.416 --> 01:07:45.999
See, Joe, after that business at Jago's,
I had to keep a special eye on you.

01:07:46.166 --> 01:07:49.416
Pick up them oranges.
Mustn't have the place looking untidy.

01:07:49.541 --> 01:07:50.999
We're expecting visitors.

01:07:52.999 --> 01:07:55.457
It's going to be quite an occasion.

01:07:55.582 --> 01:07:57.999
Their first meeting with the big shot.

01:07:58.457 --> 01:08:00.457
What time are they invited for?

01:08:00.999 --> 01:08:02.999
They'll be here any minute now.

01:08:03.124 --> 01:08:04.999
I stayed behind to open up.

01:08:05.124 --> 01:08:07.791
How were you to account
for your presence?

01:08:07.916 --> 01:08:11.791
That was the idea of putting
a password in the story.

01:08:11.916 --> 01:08:15.082
They'd wear me all right
once I'd give that.

01:08:15.207 --> 01:08:17.749
Yes, of course, the password.
I was forgetting.

01:08:18.416 --> 01:08:21.416
What made you pick on
that particular word?

01:08:21.541 --> 01:08:23.749
Seemed like a good sort of signal.

01:08:23.874 --> 01:08:27.416
There's one of our blokes,
he can make a noise...

01:08:30.999 --> 01:08:32.749
What particular word?

01:08:32.874 --> 01:08:34.249
The password.

01:08:34.916 --> 01:08:36.874
Cor, blimey, I was forgetting.

01:08:36.999 --> 01:08:39.499
You didn't get that far into the story.

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:48.999
Oh! Let me go!

01:08:49.166 --> 01:08:51.082
Oh, you're hurting me!

01:08:51.207 --> 01:08:53.416
You'll not get it out of me.

01:08:53.541 --> 01:08:55.874
You didn't know the password, did you?

01:08:56.416 --> 01:08:58.749
- You brute, you!
- Hah!

01:09:14.874 --> 01:09:15.916
Who are you?

01:09:15.999 --> 01:09:17.082
I'm the boss.

01:09:26.499 --> 01:09:27.749
Who are you?

01:09:28.582 --> 01:09:29.666
Seagull.

01:09:30.374 --> 01:09:31.999
Now that's more like it.

01:09:32.541 --> 01:09:34.666
- Young Smiler, eh?
- That's right, mate.

01:09:35.291 --> 01:09:38.499
- So he's the boss of this place.
- Seems like it.

01:09:38.624 --> 01:09:41.791
I was sent to open up and he copped me.

01:09:41.916 --> 01:09:45.374
Tie him and gag him, Larry.
Get on with the loading.

01:09:45.499 --> 01:09:46.582
I'll keep watch.

01:09:46.707 --> 01:09:50.457
Any sign of danger and I'll stroll by
whistling "The Lambeth Walk".

01:09:50.582 --> 01:09:52.457
Pass it on to the others.

01:10:09.791 --> 01:10:11.082
Operation Seagull.

01:10:39.916 --> 01:10:41.207
Operation Seagull.

01:10:42.624 --> 01:10:44.166
It's worked, come on!

01:10:51.874 --> 01:10:53.624
Yeah, I've just got time.

01:10:53.749 --> 01:10:55.666
Come on fellers, it's time!

01:10:57.832 --> 01:10:59.916
Come on, get going!

01:11:25.332 --> 01:11:27.082
She won't take it, Larry.

01:11:41.832 --> 01:11:42.874
What's that?

01:11:43.541 --> 01:11:44.666
Kids.

01:11:44.791 --> 01:11:45.999
Oh.

01:12:05.957 --> 01:12:07.582
Come on!

01:12:26.624 --> 01:12:29.499
...and showery in the north of England
and Scotland.

01:12:29.624 --> 01:12:32.582
Here's a late item of news, just come in.

01:12:32.707 --> 01:12:35.374
Urgent, all boys wanting a big adventure,

01:12:35.499 --> 01:12:38.374
go immediately
to Ballard's Wharf, Shadwell...

01:12:38.499 --> 01:12:39.749
And make it snappy.

01:13:04.124 --> 01:13:05.666
Keep it up, boys!

01:13:05.791 --> 01:13:06.916
Keep it up!

01:13:06.999 --> 01:13:09.124
Ugh!

01:13:13.624 --> 01:13:15.374
Ugh!

01:13:18.457 --> 01:13:20.332
Get a load of this!

01:13:51.582 --> 01:13:55.082
Get 'em off me!
All of 'em, get 'em off me!

01:14:05.707 --> 01:14:06.832
I've got him!

01:14:10.791 --> 01:14:12.582
- Bash him!
- Pull his hair!

01:14:13.499 --> 01:14:14.541
Kick 'em!

01:14:19.999 --> 01:14:23.207
- Oh, you coward!
- Do the lot of 'em!

01:14:46.207 --> 01:14:47.416
Stop that van!

01:17:02.749 --> 01:17:03.957
Nightingale!

01:19:35.166 --> 01:19:36.791
No you don't, my boy.

01:19:42.207 --> 01:19:43.957
Come here, my boy!

01:19:49.291 --> 01:19:50.457
Oh!

01:20:13.791 --> 01:20:15.916
Well done, Joe!

01:20:20.832 --> 01:20:27.291
I Oh, for the wings,
for the wings of a dove.

01:20:27.416 --> 01:20:31.374
In the wilderness,
build me a nest.

01:20:31.499 --> 01:20:37.999
And remain there forever.

01:20:38.124 --> 01:20:44.291
Oh, for a dove
