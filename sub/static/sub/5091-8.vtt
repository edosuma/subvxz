00:27.997 --> 00:30.816
I was glad to get your call,
Officer Reagan.

00:30.817 --> 00:32.651
I assume you're ready
to get to work.

00:32.652 --> 00:34.403
I'm out.

00:35.338 --> 00:37.272
You need to find yourself
another guy.

00:37.273 --> 00:40.108
Look, I understand
you have reservations.

00:40.109 --> 00:42.878
The Templar investigation
is a high-risk assignment.

00:42.879 --> 00:45.280
But I can offer you
the full support of the FBI.

00:45.281 --> 00:48.300
A lot of good that did
my brother Joe.

00:48.301 --> 00:50.652
Thanks, but no thanks.

00:50.653 --> 00:52.120
Reagan.

00:55.758 --> 00:58.460
I gotta say,
I'm surprised at you.

00:58.461 --> 01:01.029
You've got a lot invested in us
finding out the truth here.

01:01.030 --> 01:02.064
Yeah.

01:02.065 --> 01:03.565
Your brother's death,

01:03.566 --> 01:05.300
your father's honor.
That's exactly why

01:05.301 --> 01:06.601
I'm turning you down.

01:08.204 --> 01:10.989
Don't tell me you plan on
getting into this on your own.

01:12.775 --> 01:15.610
Like you said,
it's family business.

01:25.388 --> 01:28.290
(woman screaming, man shouting)

01:30.927 --> 01:32.010
Huh? (shouting)

01:32.011 --> 01:34.329
(screaming continues)

01:34.330 --> 01:35.597
(man shouting)

01:35.598 --> 01:37.132
JAMIE:
Police!

01:37.133 --> 01:39.301
Police! Don't move!
Drop it!

01:40.837 --> 01:42.037
Drop the gun!

01:45.007 --> 01:46.892
Drop the gun!

01:49.228 --> 01:51.446
(tires screeching)

01:54.850 --> 01:56.535
WOMAN:
Hey!

02:03.025 --> 02:05.560
(tires screeching)

02:06.696 --> 02:08.697
(people murmuring)

02:10.833 --> 02:13.101
(panting)

02:20.009 --> 02:22.644
This is Officer Reagan,
shield number 60528.

02:22.645 --> 02:24.279
I'm off duty and have one under

02:24.280 --> 02:26.714
at the intersection of Market
Street and East Broadway.

02:26.715 --> 02:28.400
The guy's been hit by a car.

02:28.401 --> 02:31.403
He's got no pulse. Need a bus
forthwith, right now.

02:31.404 --> 02:33.572
Okay.

(low, indistinct chattering)

03:07.015 --> 03:08.699
Oh, no, no.
I didn't expect this to happen.

03:08.700 --> 03:10.117
He ran right out into traffic.

03:10.118 --> 03:12.352
Now the guy's dead.
It's a total scene out here.

03:12.353 --> 03:14.354
I think every cop
in Lower Manhattan came out.

03:14.355 --> 03:15.823
Were you hurt?

03:15.824 --> 03:17.825
No, I'm fine, Dad.
Listen, don't worry about me.

03:17.826 --> 03:19.410
I just wanted to let you know,
I...

03:19.411 --> 03:21.528
I don't want this
to jam you up in any way.

03:21.529 --> 03:24.065
You just tell the truth.
You'll do fine, son.

03:25.366 --> 03:27.368
Yeah.

03:27.369 --> 03:28.803
(phone beeps)

03:30.255 --> 03:32.673
(sighs)
I gotta go. I'm sorry.

03:32.674 --> 03:34.708
Yeah. Okay. All right. Bye.

03:35.510 --> 03:37.244
Jack, give me a second. Hey.
Yeah.

03:37.245 --> 03:38.596
JAMIE: Hey.
You okay, kid?

03:38.597 --> 03:39.713
Yeah, I'm fine.

03:39.714 --> 03:40.948
You give a statement
to anybody?

03:40.949 --> 03:43.784
Yeah, I talked to, uh,
I talked to this guy.

03:44.903 --> 03:47.721
Jack. Says he gave a statement
to this guy over here.

03:47.722 --> 03:48.856
You know him?
Which one?

03:48.857 --> 03:50.724
Uh, Detective Tuan.
Yeah, I do know him.

03:50.725 --> 03:53.393
- Um, it's okay. I'll take care of it.
- What happened?

03:53.394 --> 03:56.247
Hey, you know the, uh... you
deal with the Asian Triad.

03:56.248 --> 03:58.032
They-they kidnap illegal
immigrants and try to

03:58.033 --> 04:00.501
squeeze money out of their
families back in China, right?
Yeah, yeah.

04:00.502 --> 04:01.919
It's one of their many
upstanding activities.

04:01.920 --> 04:03.904
- Why? What happened?
-  I think that's what I saw.

04:03.905 --> 04:05.840
Two suspects had guns,
but when I searched the guy,

04:05.841 --> 04:07.708
he didn't have it.
You sure they had guns?

04:07.709 --> 04:09.376
Yeah. He had it.
He must have tossed it.

04:09.377 --> 04:11.912
A gun's not gonna last long on
the streets of Chinatown, kid.

04:11.913 --> 04:13.614
What else?
There was one other woman--

04:13.615 --> 04:15.282
a Chinese woman--
she saw the whole thing.

04:15.283 --> 04:16.716
Perp pushed her up
against the wall.

04:16.718 --> 04:18.486
She might have had
lacerations on her forehead.

04:18.487 --> 04:19.970
I gotta find two Asian women
in Chinatown?

04:19.971 --> 04:21.922
Now what were you doing down
here, anyway? You're off duty.

04:21.923 --> 04:24.058
Just walking around, blowing
off steam after my tour.

04:24.059 --> 04:25.559
Look, Internal Affairs
is gonna be

04:25.560 --> 04:27.427
all over you. They're gonna want
to speak to witnesses,

04:27.428 --> 04:29.647
want to know who you were
talking to, what you were doing.

04:29.648 --> 04:32.432
I got it. I got it. All right. All right.
Get your story straight.

04:32.433 --> 04:34.735
Glad you're all right.

04:36.138 --> 04:37.437
(sighs)

04:37.438 --> 04:39.039
FRANK:
Chief Flores, is it the policy

04:39.040 --> 04:41.625
of Internal Affairs to call
the police commissioner

04:41.626 --> 04:44.578
every time you open up an
investigation into the conduct

04:44.579 --> 04:46.480
of a New York City
police officer?

04:46.481 --> 04:49.800
This conversation shouldn't be
taking place, John.

04:49.801 --> 04:53.787
If it ends here,
it didn't.

05:00.962 --> 05:02.346
(KELLY whispers)
I'll be right there.

05:02.347 --> 05:04.631
I just want to say hi
to someone.

05:07.152 --> 05:08.319
Commissioner.

05:08.320 --> 05:10.171
Kelly Davidson,
Channel 10 News.

05:10.172 --> 05:12.773
Sure. You worked the
Sebastian Calso case.

05:12.774 --> 05:14.642
That was a great job,
by the way.

05:14.643 --> 05:17.912
And of course, the mayor took
all the credit for it, but...

05:24.252 --> 05:26.687
How are you, Frank?

05:26.688 --> 05:28.455
How are you?

05:28.456 --> 05:29.557
I'm working too hard.

05:29.558 --> 05:31.759
Hazard of both our jobs,
I think.

05:32.627 --> 05:34.361
I miss you.

05:36.331 --> 05:38.232
And I know I screwed things up.

05:38.233 --> 05:40.367
MAN:
Frank Reagan!

05:40.368 --> 05:42.102
(chuckles)

05:42.103 --> 05:45.439
Councilman Welch.
Good to see you.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.507
I didn't know they let
you out of Brooklyn.

05:47.508 --> 05:49.977
Yeah, well, unlike
the Dodgers, I'll be back.

05:49.978 --> 05:52.112
This is Kelly Davidson,
Channel 10 News.

05:52.113 --> 05:54.231
Nice to meet you.
I've seen you on TV.

05:54.232 --> 05:56.650
Well, excuse me.
I have to get back.

05:56.651 --> 05:58.518
Nice talking to you,
Miss Davidson.

06:00.088 --> 06:02.122
Are you working on
something here?

06:02.123 --> 06:05.292
Yeah. Uh...

06:05.293 --> 06:07.211
DOA's Grant Lee.

06:07.212 --> 06:09.663
He's a foot soldier
in one of the Triads down here.

06:09.664 --> 06:11.531
- Any sign of the driver?
- Yeah, we're looking for

06:11.532 --> 06:14.201
a blue Subaru Impreza WRX,
with New York plates.

06:14.202 --> 06:16.203
I.A.'s gonna be all over
my little brother.

06:16.204 --> 06:18.756
It would really help if we
could find the bad guy here.

06:18.757 --> 06:20.841
Said something
about two girls?

06:20.842 --> 06:22.710
Two Chinese women
in their early-to-mid-20s,

06:22.711 --> 06:24.311
with shoulder-length
black hair.

06:24.312 --> 06:26.146
That describes 30 people
just at my wedding.

06:26.147 --> 06:27.848
Yeah. No talkers
in the crowd, huh?

06:27.849 --> 06:30.684
No. See no evil,
hear no evil, do no evil.

06:30.685 --> 06:32.820
I've tried three different
languages. No luck.

06:32.821 --> 06:35.289
My brother said one of the girls
had a scratch on her forehead.

06:35.290 --> 06:36.890
Does that girl have a
scratch on her forehead?

06:36.891 --> 06:38.558
JACKIE:
Yes, she does.

06:38.559 --> 06:40.561
Excuse me. Miss?

06:40.562 --> 06:43.364
We'd like to ask you
a few questions, okay?

06:43.365 --> 06:44.365
It's okay.
It's okay.

06:44.366 --> 06:46.033
I just want to ask you
a few questions.

06:46.034 --> 06:47.601
(speaks Chinese)

06:47.602 --> 06:48.786
Come on.

06:48.787 --> 06:50.271
This way.
It's okay.

06:50.272 --> 06:53.040
(footsteps approaching)

06:54.509 --> 06:56.610
How did you get the
scrape on your head?

06:57.479 --> 06:59.246
I fell down.
Mm.

06:59.247 --> 07:01.515
You mind if I look
at your hands?

07:06.521 --> 07:08.522
No scrapes.

07:08.523 --> 07:09.890
You know, most people,

07:09.891 --> 07:11.558
when they fall down,
they put their hands

07:11.559 --> 07:13.027
in front of them
to break their fall.

07:13.028 --> 07:14.361
So I'm thinking
you might have

07:14.362 --> 07:16.997
got that scrape on your
head a different way.

07:16.998 --> 07:18.666
Maybe somebody might have
pushed you up against a wall

07:18.667 --> 07:20.668
while they were trying
to kidnap your friend?

07:23.438 --> 07:25.239
So our dead guy, Grant Lee,

07:25.240 --> 07:28.409
been arrested for assault and
bribery-- typical gang stuff.

07:28.410 --> 07:30.944
Printed out some photos
of his known associates.

07:32.297 --> 07:34.498
You recognize these guys?

07:37.285 --> 07:38.285
No.

07:38.286 --> 07:40.387
I don't really believe you.

07:40.388 --> 07:43.457
Listen, I know these
gangsters are scary,

07:43.458 --> 07:45.526
okay, but your friend
is in danger.

07:45.527 --> 07:46.927
And she can only
hide so long

07:46.928 --> 07:48.762
before she's gonna
have to come out.

07:48.763 --> 07:51.632
Now wouldn't it be better if we
found her before they do?

07:51.633 --> 07:53.667
We don't care about
your immigration status, okay?

07:53.668 --> 07:56.103
We just really need to know
where your friend is.

07:56.971 --> 07:58.672
Ming-Tai not my friend.

07:58.673 --> 08:00.140
I just met her.

08:00.141 --> 08:01.191
JACKIE:
Ming-Tai's her name?

08:01.192 --> 08:02.860
Can you tell us her last name?

08:02.861 --> 08:05.145
DANNY:
Where does she live?

08:07.699 --> 08:08.999
Gong si fong.

08:09.818 --> 08:10.817
What is that?

08:10.818 --> 08:12.870
I show you.

08:12.871 --> 08:14.955
We live in same gong si fong,

08:14.956 --> 08:16.623
and then she move.
Why?

08:16.624 --> 08:17.725
Why did she move?

08:17.726 --> 08:18.859
Trouble.

08:18.860 --> 08:19.827
What kind of trouble?

08:19.828 --> 08:22.012
Chinatown trouble.

08:24.366 --> 08:27.768
SYDNEY: Jamie, I know you wanted
to do the right thing, but...

08:27.769 --> 08:30.354
you were off duty.
You should have called 911.

08:31.473 --> 08:33.607
There wasn't time.

08:33.607 --> 08:35.676
You didn't
have any backup.

08:35.677 --> 08:40.547
You know, it's you against
two gangsters with guns.

08:40.548 --> 08:43.984
Syd, I didn't get hurt.
I'm okay.

08:43.985 --> 08:47.388
Yes. And thank God
for that, but...

08:50.925 --> 08:53.360
Just a couple weeks ago,
a cop got killed

08:53.361 --> 08:55.562
because she walked
into the middle of a crime,

08:55.563 --> 08:57.331
and tonight, that
could have been you.

08:57.332 --> 08:59.933
Sydney, I'm standing right here.

08:59.934 --> 09:02.403
With you, in the kitchen.
Safe and sound.

09:02.404 --> 09:03.537
This time.

09:03.538 --> 09:05.672
Yes, this time, and the
next time, and the next.

09:05.673 --> 09:07.925
And you think
you're invincible?

09:22.157 --> 09:24.724
Front-page headlines
in the <i>Daily</i> <i>News,</i> sir.

09:24.725 --> 09:27.244
"Top Cop Son Chases Gangster
Into Fatal Crash""

09:27.245 --> 09:29.896
Cover of <i>Newsday,</i>
the <i>Post.</i>

09:29.897 --> 09:31.565
Item in the Metro
section of the <i>Times,</i>

09:31.566 --> 09:33.333
with a longer piece
in their blog.

09:33.334 --> 09:36.904
Baker, I have 36,000
police officers in my command

09:36.905 --> 09:39.139
and eight million people
in this city to look after.

09:39.140 --> 09:41.375
What else you got?
We've apprehended

09:41.376 --> 09:43.710
a suspect in the Forest Hills
taxicab robberies.

09:43.711 --> 09:45.946
Press conference on the
downtown security initiative

09:45.947 --> 09:47.548
at 1400 hours.

09:47.549 --> 09:49.767
But with all due respect, sir,

09:49.768 --> 09:52.085
the press is going to ask
about this incident

09:52.086 --> 09:53.387
involving your son.

09:53.388 --> 09:55.656
I wouldn't minimize
its importance on your agenda.

09:55.657 --> 09:57.458
(sighs)
I know that.

09:57.459 --> 09:58.925
But thank you.

10:03.698 --> 10:05.566
(sighs)

10:18.680 --> 10:20.047
(phone ringing)

10:20.048 --> 10:21.415
Commissioner.

10:21.416 --> 10:23.834
Hey! I hear Jack caught
a touchdown pass yesterday.

10:23.835 --> 10:26.303
Yeah, he did. You calling about
that, or are you looking for

10:26.304 --> 10:27.471
information about Jamie's
missing girl?

10:27.472 --> 10:28.722
Well, if I were

10:28.723 --> 10:31.225
calling you as the police
commissioner, it would be

10:31.226 --> 10:34.294
to the lead detective in a
politically sensitive case.

10:34.295 --> 10:35.479
Whatever you say, Dad.

10:35.480 --> 10:36.497
Guess where I am.

10:36.498 --> 10:37.848
Surprise me.

10:37.849 --> 10:39.817
I'm in a one-bedroom
apartment shared by 30 women

10:39.818 --> 10:42.135
who take shifts sleeping
on mattresses on the floor.

10:42.136 --> 10:44.204
You know, it's kind of like
Aunt Sally's at Thanksgiving,

10:44.205 --> 10:45.472
only times ten.

10:45.473 --> 10:46.806
It's called gong si fong,

10:46.807 --> 10:48.808
and who would you be looking
to find there?

10:48.809 --> 10:49.809
I'm looking to find

10:49.810 --> 10:51.245
Jamie's kidnap vic.

10:51.246 --> 10:53.197
It's my only lead, but there's
a hundred gong si fongs

10:53.198 --> 10:55.048
all over Chinatown,
so it's not going too good.

10:55.049 --> 10:56.283
Anything on the car yet?

10:56.284 --> 10:57.784
You know what? Actually,
I may have something by now.

10:57.785 --> 11:00.587
I'll get back to you.
(sighs)

11:04.292 --> 11:05.626
I can't get anything
on Ming-Tai--

11:05.627 --> 11:07.060
no last name, no idea
where she worked,

11:07.061 --> 11:08.395
no idea where
she moved to.

11:08.396 --> 11:10.497
Come on! The girl told me
she lived here for over a year.

11:10.498 --> 11:11.865
Somebody's got
to know something.

11:11.866 --> 11:14.167
Most of these women are
fresh off the boat, all right?

11:14.168 --> 11:15.636
They're afraid of cops.

11:15.637 --> 11:17.104
But they trust the gangsters
who brought them over here?

11:17.105 --> 11:19.506
No. They fear them
even more.

11:19.507 --> 11:20.974
Great.

11:20.975 --> 11:24.228
These 500 new MTA cameras
will give us another tool

11:24.229 --> 11:27.281
in protecting our five million
daily transit riders.

11:27.282 --> 11:28.615
Questions?
Commissioner!

11:28.616 --> 11:30.284
How can the city
afford this,

11:30.285 --> 11:32.352
when we're already
laying off transit workers?

11:32.353 --> 11:33.620
We can't afford not to.

11:33.621 --> 11:35.739
KELLY: Commissioner. We hear that
no one has come forward

11:35.740 --> 11:37.090
to corroborate
your son's account

11:37.091 --> 11:38.742
of the attempted abduction
in Chinatown.

11:38.743 --> 11:41.361
- That's not a question, Miss Davidson.
- Well, is this case

11:41.362 --> 11:44.197
getting special consideration
because your son is involved?

11:44.198 --> 11:46.333
No. Next question.

11:46.334 --> 11:47.834
(clamoring)

11:47.835 --> 11:51.138
Time is 1415 hours.

11:51.139 --> 11:53.674
I am Lieutenant Alex Bello
of Internal Affairs,

11:53.675 --> 11:57.711
present with Probationary
Officer Jamison Reagan,

11:57.712 --> 12:01.014
and PBA Attorney
Kenneth Weber.

12:01.015 --> 12:03.350
Officer Reagan,
did you know the deceased?

12:03.351 --> 12:05.485
No.

12:05.486 --> 12:07.352
Did you ever talk to him
before last night?

12:07.377 --> 12:08.422
No. Never.

12:08.423 --> 12:10.357
So what made you stop
and talk to him?

12:11.626 --> 12:13.927
I didn't talk to him.

12:13.928 --> 12:16.363
I saw him and another man
assaulting two women.

12:16.364 --> 12:18.298
Both men had guns.

12:18.299 --> 12:21.768
They were attempting
to kidnap one of the women.

12:21.769 --> 12:25.405
I identified myself
and told them not to move.

12:26.457 --> 12:28.792
You were off duty.

12:28.793 --> 12:31.078
Why didn't you
just call 911?

12:32.647 --> 12:35.248
I think any officer
worth their salt would've...

12:35.249 --> 12:36.783
done what I did
in that situation.

12:36.784 --> 12:39.770
Hmm. Sure sounds good.

12:39.771 --> 12:41.488
But the thing is,

12:41.489 --> 12:42.773
we can't find
a single witness

12:42.774 --> 12:44.791
to corroborate
your side of the story.

12:45.893 --> 12:47.861
Alley where the crime
took place was deserted.

12:47.862 --> 12:48.929
That's why they picked it.

12:48.930 --> 12:50.230
What were you doing
in that neighborhood

12:50.231 --> 12:52.032
that time of night,
Officer Reagan?

12:53.101 --> 12:56.169
My apartment's not far...
from that location.

12:56.170 --> 12:57.471
I was out taking a walk.

12:57.472 --> 12:59.139
Having dinner with someone?

12:59.140 --> 13:00.674
No.

13:00.675 --> 13:02.109
Meeting a friend?

13:02.110 --> 13:04.177
- No.
- Really?

13:05.413 --> 13:07.714
'Cause we have witnesses
that say they saw you earlier

13:07.715 --> 13:09.583
talking with a woman
with red hair.

13:11.352 --> 13:12.886
You care to tell me
who that is?

13:12.887 --> 13:15.422
- You kidding?
- Does it look like I'm kidding?

13:15.423 --> 13:17.324
WEBER: I want to remind you,
Lieutenant,

13:17.325 --> 13:18.925
that Officer Reagan only
has to answer questions

13:18.926 --> 13:21.061
specifically directed
to his official duties.

13:21.062 --> 13:23.397
JAMIE: No, it's okay.
I just find it ironic

13:23.398 --> 13:25.198
that you can't find someone
to identify the vic,

13:25.199 --> 13:26.833
but you can find someone
to say that they saw me

13:26.834 --> 13:28.035
talking to a woman
with red hair.

13:28.036 --> 13:30.604
Redheads stick out
in that neighborhood.

13:34.242 --> 13:35.826
She was a tourist.

13:37.178 --> 13:39.546
She was looking to buy some
designer knockoff stuff.

13:39.547 --> 13:41.531
I pointed her
toward Canal Street.

13:43.534 --> 13:45.786
I'm gonna need her name
and her contact information.

13:45.787 --> 13:47.087
I don't have it.

13:47.088 --> 13:50.657
Like I said, she's a tourist
I met for two seconds.

13:52.060 --> 13:53.994
WEBER: If you don't have
any more questions,

13:53.995 --> 13:57.297
Officer Reagan needs
to get back to his command.

14:01.552 --> 14:04.104
(recorder beeps) Officer Reagan,
you should know the commissioner

14:04.105 --> 14:06.606
has directed us to be
extra rigorous

14:06.607 --> 14:08.008
in our investigation.

14:08.009 --> 14:09.876
We're gonna leave
no stone unturned.

14:09.877 --> 14:12.045
I expect nothing less.

14:19.987 --> 14:22.039
Okay, I just got these pictures
off a red light camera

14:22.040 --> 14:25.742
on the corner of Houston
and Avenue C at 2045 last night.

14:25.743 --> 14:28.595
It's a Subaru Impreza WRX.
It's the same car

14:28.596 --> 14:29.796
that your
brother described.

14:29.797 --> 14:31.331
Different neighborhood.
It's close, though.

14:31.332 --> 14:33.700
Timeline works. You get a shot
of the license plate?
Mm-hmm.

14:33.701 --> 14:36.336
Nancy-Union-Queen-1-7-2-4.

14:36.337 --> 14:37.816
Great. You run this?
Yeah, I ran it.

14:37.816 --> 14:39.306
Where do you think
I was, ordering pizza?

14:39.307 --> 14:42.309
It's, uh, Nelson Chiu.
Last known address

14:42.310 --> 14:43.543
was 447 Mott Street.

14:43.544 --> 14:44.711
Let's take a ride.

14:44.712 --> 14:46.346
Hey, Jamie. It's Danny.
Look, you got time

14:46.347 --> 14:48.381
to meet us over in Chinatown?

14:48.382 --> 14:49.733
All right. Great.
We'll see you there.

14:51.051 --> 14:52.686
♪ ♪

14:52.687 --> 14:54.488
WOMEN:
Whoo!

15:02.997 --> 15:04.331
Nelson Chiu.
Detective Reagan.

15:04.332 --> 15:07.200
This is my partner,
Detective Curatola.

15:07.201 --> 15:08.401
We need to speak
to you outside.

15:09.036 --> 15:10.737
I'm eating.
No.

15:10.738 --> 15:12.439
Actually, you're smoking.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.541
Can't do that in a restaurant,
my friend.

15:16.844 --> 15:18.211
Put the bottle down.

15:19.113 --> 15:20.714
(clatter)

15:21.949 --> 15:24.017
(speaks Cantonese)

15:24.018 --> 15:26.086
Hey! That better mean
"Try the fried rice,"

15:26.087 --> 15:27.988
or you're coming, too.
Now sit down.

15:34.128 --> 15:36.730
Come on,
hands up against the car.

15:36.731 --> 15:38.198
Give him a toss.

15:38.199 --> 15:39.483
Yeah, let's go.
(grunts)

15:40.601 --> 15:42.319
Hey, lady, I get
a lap dance after this?

15:42.320 --> 15:44.437
Yeah, here's your lap dance.
(cries out)

15:44.438 --> 15:46.273
(groans)

15:46.274 --> 15:48.325
He's clean.
Hey!

15:50.611 --> 15:52.779
Is that him?

15:54.448 --> 15:55.549
Yeah. He was the driver.

15:55.550 --> 15:56.950
DANNY: You sure he had
a gun on him?

15:56.951 --> 15:58.451
Positive.
All right. Good.

15:58.452 --> 16:00.020
All right. Can we get back
to work now, Detective?

16:00.021 --> 16:01.788
Yeah. Go write
some tickets.
All right.

16:01.789 --> 16:02.689
Cuff him.

16:02.690 --> 16:04.057
- What?
- You're under arrest.

16:04.058 --> 16:05.258
- For what?
- For what?

16:05.259 --> 16:07.194
For making me ruin
a perfectly good lobster.

16:07.195 --> 16:08.979
(scoffs)

16:08.980 --> 16:10.981
Let's go.

16:17.587 --> 16:19.638
CHIU:
Ming-Tai?

16:19.639 --> 16:21.435
I don't know no Ming-Tai.
Where's my lawyer?

16:21.436 --> 16:23.409
DANNY: He called.
He's stuck in traffic.

16:23.409 --> 16:25.414
His office
is six blocks from here.

16:25.679 --> 16:28.397
Yeah. Makes it all the more
stupid that he chose to drive.

16:28.398 --> 16:30.215
Why were you trying
to kidnap Ming-Tai?

16:30.216 --> 16:32.385
No speaky Engrish.

16:32.386 --> 16:33.652
What did you say?

16:33.653 --> 16:35.588
I said, "No speaky Engrish."

16:35.589 --> 16:37.923
Well, I see you can
"writy Engrish."

16:37.924 --> 16:39.942
I found your Web site.

16:39.943 --> 16:41.827
Asian Comfort Escort Services.

16:41.828 --> 16:44.229
$250 an hour,
with a two-hour minimum.

16:44.230 --> 16:46.231
Outcalls only.
This is classy stuff.

16:46.232 --> 16:48.066
That's a legitimate
site, man.

16:48.067 --> 16:49.902
Those are escorts,
not hookers.

16:49.903 --> 16:51.637
Mm. Is Ming-Tai
one of your escorts?

16:51.638 --> 16:53.372
What did she do,
steal money from you?

16:53.373 --> 16:54.840
You know what
you gotta do?

16:54.841 --> 16:56.976
You gotta get yourself a
dog, and name it Ming-Tai,

16:56.977 --> 16:58.911
so that every time
you say "Ming-Tai""

16:58.912 --> 17:00.346
someone actually knows
what you're talking about,

17:00.347 --> 17:01.580
'cause I don't.

17:01.581 --> 17:03.416
Now go get my lawyer.
You think you're tough,

17:03.417 --> 17:04.784
wise guy?

17:04.785 --> 17:06.119
'Cause personally,
I think you're scum. In fact,

17:06.121 --> 17:07.566
I think you're lower
than the sticky stuff

17:07.590 --> 17:08.686
(knock on door)

17:08.688 --> 17:10.189
on the bottom of my shoe. Yes?

17:10.190 --> 17:11.357
Uh, somebody to see you.

17:12.943 --> 17:14.260
- Who?
- Someone who knows

17:14.261 --> 17:15.895
you cried at <i>E.T.</i>

17:24.104 --> 17:25.438
You giving away all my

17:25.439 --> 17:26.605
childhood secrets
to my partner?

17:26.606 --> 17:27.873
What brings you here?

17:27.874 --> 17:29.673
You gotta cut
Nelson Chiu loose.

17:29.698 --> 17:31.178
I don't have to
cut anybody loose.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.842
Look, I want to help Jamie
as much as you do,

17:32.843 --> 17:35.426
but you brought a guy in on a
gun charge without a gun.

17:35.451 --> 17:37.107
Hey, Jamie gave a
positive I.D.,

17:37.108 --> 17:38.475
and he said
the guy had a gun.

17:38.476 --> 17:40.711
And in Jamie's own admission,
it was dark. He could have been

17:40.779 --> 17:42.713
waving around a water pistol
to intimidate that victim.

17:42.714 --> 17:45.583
A cop says a guy has a gun,
then the guy has a gun.

17:45.584 --> 17:47.919
I talked to my boss. We are not
prosecuting this case.

17:47.920 --> 17:52.273
Your boss. Your boss
is covering his own ass.

17:52.274 --> 17:54.325
Now, this guy's gonna
walk on bail tomorrow.

17:54.326 --> 17:55.760
You gotta give me something.

17:58.797 --> 18:00.598
Misdemeanor assault.

18:00.599 --> 18:02.934
It's the best I can do.

18:02.935 --> 18:05.119
Great.

18:09.508 --> 18:10.841
Didn't mean to wake you, Pop.

18:10.842 --> 18:12.009
Nah, you didn't.

18:12.828 --> 18:14.211
I couldn't sleep.

18:18.317 --> 18:21.652
I just keep thinking about
this cop in Narcotics

18:21.653 --> 18:23.287
who almost got
himself in a jam

18:23.288 --> 18:25.556
back in the day when
I was commissioner.

18:27.392 --> 18:29.060
Somebody dropped
a dime on him,

18:29.061 --> 18:31.762
and kept saying that
he was skimming money

18:31.763 --> 18:33.648
from his drug collars.

18:33.649 --> 18:36.400
So the chief of I.A.

18:36.401 --> 18:38.336
calls me up to tell me about it.

18:38.337 --> 18:40.296
Says I might like to
talk to the cop,

18:40.321 --> 18:41.521
and give him a heads-up.

18:41.857 --> 18:45.609
I told him not only was I not
going to talk

18:45.610 --> 18:47.178
to the cop in question,

18:47.179 --> 18:48.779
but I wanted the I.A.

18:48.780 --> 18:52.249
to put their best
investigator on the case.

18:52.250 --> 18:57.221
So then they set up a couple
of decoy busts on you, and...

18:57.222 --> 19:00.458
you came up smelling
like roses, Francis.

19:02.561 --> 19:04.595
You never told me.

19:04.596 --> 19:08.432
I had to sit back
and watch you be investigated.

19:08.433 --> 19:10.201
It pained me.

19:10.202 --> 19:13.337
Every instinct a father has

19:13.338 --> 19:16.407
is to step in
and protect his kid.

19:20.379 --> 19:21.712
Is that ham?

19:22.848 --> 19:24.482
'Cause I could eat.

19:24.483 --> 19:27.418
Mmm.

19:33.258 --> 19:36.394
NICKY: <i>How come you didn't</i>
<i>become a cop?</i>

19:36.395 --> 19:39.897
Well, your uncles always wanted
to be policemen.

19:39.898 --> 19:42.566
They were always playing
detective around the house.

19:42.567 --> 19:45.369
And I... I never felt the call.

19:45.370 --> 19:47.338
- But you did to be a lawyer.
- Yeah.

19:47.339 --> 19:50.141
Yeah, to serve the law
in a different way.

19:50.142 --> 19:53.611
Which means that sometimes,
I'm not on the side of the cops.

19:53.612 --> 19:55.446
Cops aren't perfect.

19:55.447 --> 19:56.747
You mean, like the time

19:56.748 --> 19:58.567
Uncle Danny stuck a man's head
in a toilet?

19:58.568 --> 20:01.770
Yeah. Your Uncle Danny
is a really good cop,

20:01.953 --> 20:04.622
but sometimes, he
gets carried away.

20:04.623 --> 20:08.075
Which, at your age,
came in very handy,

20:08.076 --> 20:09.827
at times.

20:09.828 --> 20:11.562
- What do you mean?
- Meaning,

20:11.563 --> 20:13.998
your Uncle Danny
would always protect me.

20:13.999 --> 20:15.299
If I was ever in trouble,

20:15.300 --> 20:17.201
he would suddenly
come out of the woodwork.

20:17.202 --> 20:19.236
He was like my personal bodyguard.
(phone rings)

20:19.237 --> 20:20.905
Like what kind of trouble?

20:20.906 --> 20:23.107
No. You're not going
to get that out of me.

20:23.108 --> 20:25.309
Hold on.

20:26.378 --> 20:28.846
Hi. We were just
talking about you.

20:28.847 --> 20:30.548
Yeah? Well, I hope you're saying
I should have listened

20:30.549 --> 20:32.883
to my brother Danny, and kept
Nelson Chiu locked up.

20:32.884 --> 20:33.934
Why?

20:33.935 --> 20:35.252
Because he's dead.

20:35.253 --> 20:36.253
What?

20:36.254 --> 20:37.605
Yeah. Thank your
boss for me.

20:37.606 --> 20:39.423
I just found him on
the Lower East Side,

20:39.424 --> 20:41.492
with a bullet hole in his
head, shot execution style.

20:41.493 --> 20:43.461
It's a signature of his Triad.

20:43.462 --> 20:45.129
His gang got to him?

20:45.130 --> 20:47.098
So you have no victim
to press charges,

20:47.099 --> 20:48.766
and both your suspects
are dead.

20:48.767 --> 20:50.000
Well, I can't drop it now.

20:50.001 --> 20:51.702
Jamie might have stumbled
upon something big,

20:51.703 --> 20:52.903
if they're killing
one of their own.

20:52.904 --> 20:54.338
It'll be a lot easier on Jamie

20:54.339 --> 20:55.806
if you can
figure this out, Danny.

20:55.807 --> 20:57.608
- The girl's still out there.
- Really?

20:57.609 --> 21:00.795
Well, thanks for telling me.
Good-bye.

21:00.796 --> 21:03.130
- You find anything?
- Nope.

21:03.131 --> 21:05.049
No cell phone. No wallet.

21:06.468 --> 21:07.651
(sighs)

21:12.307 --> 21:13.924
DANNY:
Hold on!

21:15.060 --> 21:16.327
How about this?

21:16.328 --> 21:17.645
Mott Street Munificent Society.

21:17.646 --> 21:18.963
You ever heard of that?

21:18.964 --> 21:21.966
Yeah. It's kind of like
a community service center.

21:21.967 --> 21:24.635
They teach English classes,
offer free legal advice.

21:24.636 --> 21:26.003
They even have a medical clinic.

21:26.004 --> 21:27.655
Are they tied into Nelson Chiu's
Triad, by any chance?

21:27.656 --> 21:29.139
Not that I know of.
JACKIE: Okay.

21:29.140 --> 21:30.807
I just got off the phone
with the M.E.

21:30.808 --> 21:32.776
She's doing the autopsy now
on Grant Lee,

21:32.777 --> 21:34.879
Chiu's partner
in the attempted kidnapping.
Yeah.

21:34.880 --> 21:37.448
Had some fresh blood on him
that wasn't his.

21:37.449 --> 21:40.167
Says it's that of a woman's.
Probably Ming-Tai.

21:40.168 --> 21:41.919
Get this-- she was pregnant.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.387
When we spoke to Wai-Chee,

21:43.388 --> 21:44.889
she didn't say Ming-Tai
was pregnant.

21:44.890 --> 21:46.757
- No.
- They say how far along she was?

21:46.758 --> 21:48.092
Yeah. Third trimester.

21:48.093 --> 21:49.376
TUAN: Well, if it is Ming-Tai,
and if she is pregnant,

21:49.377 --> 21:51.162
she's probably not working
as an escort anymore.

21:51.163 --> 21:52.930
So what does the Triad
still want with her?

21:56.768 --> 21:58.519
♪ ♪

22:32.127 --> 22:35.346
You know, I never knew what
a Munificent Society was till now.

22:35.347 --> 22:37.882
Dennis Eng, proprietor.

22:37.883 --> 22:40.711
Nelson Chiu.
Doesn't sound familiar.

22:40.712 --> 22:42.813
But we help a lot
of people here.

22:42.814 --> 22:44.481
Maybe he was one of them.

22:44.482 --> 22:46.433
Well, can you
check your records?

22:46.434 --> 22:48.686
- It's Chiu, C-H-I-U.
- Of course.

22:48.687 --> 22:50.320
TUAN: Chiu didn't seem
like the kind of guy

22:50.321 --> 22:51.655
who would need
your help, Mr. Eng.

22:51.656 --> 22:53.390
- Any chance he worked here?
- No.

22:53.391 --> 22:54.425
That I would know.

22:54.426 --> 22:56.160
Chiu is a very popular name.

22:56.161 --> 22:57.911
You may have heard
of Jimmy Choo.

22:57.912 --> 22:58.896
(smug laughter)

22:58.897 --> 23:00.631
But there is no one

23:00.632 --> 23:04.401
in our database named
Nelson C-H-I-U.

23:04.402 --> 23:06.837
Do you do any work
with gangs? Triads?

23:06.838 --> 23:10.140
We sponsor a midnight basketball
program to deter teenagers

23:10.141 --> 23:11.125
from joining gangs.

23:11.126 --> 23:12.776
JACKIE:
What about, uh, Ming-Tai?

23:12.777 --> 23:14.428
That sound familiar?

23:14.429 --> 23:15.679
I can search.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.347
Do you know her last name?

23:17.348 --> 23:20.551
JACKIE:
Unfortunately, no.

23:20.552 --> 23:22.519
This your, uh,
clinic over here?

23:22.520 --> 23:24.188
Yes.
Oh.

23:24.189 --> 23:25.973
- Let me just take a little peek.
- Uh...

23:25.974 --> 23:27.791
This is not a good time.

23:27.792 --> 23:29.059
Why?

23:33.565 --> 23:35.365
Excuse me.

23:35.366 --> 23:38.268
I'm looking for a
pregnant woman, uh, Ming-Tai.

23:38.269 --> 23:40.070
Maybe you can help me?

23:40.071 --> 23:41.288
(speaking Chinese)

23:41.289 --> 23:43.207
We provide free
medical services

23:43.208 --> 23:44.575
to people who can't afford them.

23:44.576 --> 23:45.576
Can we look around?

23:45.577 --> 23:47.144
- Not at this time.
- Why not?

23:47.145 --> 23:49.463
Many of our clients
are illegal immigrants.

23:49.464 --> 23:50.447
You're frightening them.

23:50.448 --> 23:52.382
Please leave.

23:52.383 --> 23:54.351
Please!
JACKIE: Okay!

23:55.053 --> 23:56.720
Thanks.

24:03.461 --> 24:05.929
It's an advertisement
for an adoption agency.

24:05.930 --> 24:07.264
What does it say?

24:07.265 --> 24:08.682
It says, "If you're single
and pregnant,

24:08.683 --> 24:10.434
"or married
and can't afford it,

24:10.435 --> 24:13.570
you can put it up for
adoption... and be rewarded."

24:13.571 --> 24:16.440
Rewarded? Rewarded,
like in money?

24:16.441 --> 24:18.208
It's cagey
the way it's phrased,

24:18.209 --> 24:19.827
but that's what it
sounds like to me.

24:19.828 --> 24:21.111
All right, all right.

24:21.112 --> 24:22.529
So let's say Ming-Tai's
working as an escort.

24:22.530 --> 24:23.664
She gets pregnant
by a john.

24:23.665 --> 24:25.582
She comes down
to the munificent society...

24:25.583 --> 24:27.885
Yeah. They tell her to give
her baby up for adoption.

24:27.886 --> 24:29.086
They'll give her money.

24:29.087 --> 24:31.955
Maybe enough to start
a whole new life.

24:35.376 --> 24:38.095
Look, we know Ming-Tai
was pregnant.

24:38.096 --> 24:41.331
Was she going
to give up her baby?

24:42.300 --> 24:44.101
For money?

24:44.102 --> 24:46.303
- Yes.
- How much?

24:46.304 --> 24:47.704
5,000 dollar.

24:47.705 --> 24:49.907
They say she will get
after she have baby.

24:49.908 --> 24:50.941
Who said?

24:50.942 --> 24:53.177
She called phone number.

24:53.178 --> 24:56.012
They say... go to clinic...
for doctor appointment.

24:56.013 --> 24:58.699
Is this the phone number?

25:01.753 --> 25:04.488
Do you know
who she saw there?

25:06.157 --> 25:08.025
American doctor.

25:08.026 --> 25:10.077
He only is there on Thursdays.

25:12.864 --> 25:15.299
Okay.

25:16.034 --> 25:17.668
MAN:
<i>I'm a fertility doctor.</i>

25:17.669 --> 25:18.669
I help women
get pregnant.

25:18.670 --> 25:19.920
I don't really
see how I could

25:19.921 --> 25:21.672
help you find this girl
you're looking for.

25:21.673 --> 25:25.375
Do you work at the Munificent
Society Clinic in Chinatown?

25:25.376 --> 25:27.561
Uh, I do pro bono work
for them occasionally.

25:27.562 --> 25:28.612
Right. Every Thursday.

25:28.613 --> 25:30.147
Okay.
You ever see

25:30.148 --> 25:32.149
one of these?
Um...

25:32.150 --> 25:33.116
No. Never have.

25:33.117 --> 25:34.718
Well, it says
they offer money

25:34.719 --> 25:36.620
to pregnant Chinese women
for their babies.

25:36.621 --> 25:38.522
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

25:38.523 --> 25:40.457
Wh-why would I be involved
with something like that?

25:40.458 --> 25:42.743
I... I have a thriving
fertility practice.

25:42.744 --> 25:45.662
All right. Okay.
Excuse me.

25:45.663 --> 25:46.747
Actually,

25:46.748 --> 25:48.916
about that thriving
fertility practice--

25:48.917 --> 25:50.534
what's a cycle of IVF
run you, about?

25:50.535 --> 25:53.337
Anywhere between $12,000
and $15,000 a cycle.

25:53.338 --> 25:54.738
Is that right?

25:54.739 --> 25:58.108
But a healthy Chinese baby will
get you, what, 45, 50 grand...

25:58.109 --> 25:59.843
cash, off the books?

25:59.844 --> 26:02.110
That's like a year's worth
of IVF right there, isn't it?

26:02.135 --> 26:03.213
Maybe.

26:03.214 --> 26:05.415
I mean, because people like
to adopt Chinese babies.

26:05.416 --> 26:07.017
They're smart,
grow up to be

26:07.018 --> 26:08.518
future doctors, like yourself.
You know what?

26:08.519 --> 26:11.421
I find this entire conversation
offensive. Excuse me.

26:11.422 --> 26:13.924
(car door slams)

26:13.925 --> 26:16.393
He's sensitive.
He's very sensitive.

26:16.394 --> 26:19.062
RENZULLI: Get some mustard,
sauerkraut, please?

26:19.063 --> 26:20.497
Want a dog?
No.

26:20.498 --> 26:22.099
Sure?
Yeah.

26:22.100 --> 26:25.736
Had a nice little visit with the
good folks at I.A. this morning.

26:25.737 --> 26:27.104
Yeah? What did
they ask you?

26:27.105 --> 26:29.489
You know I'm not supposed
to talk about that, right?

26:29.490 --> 26:31.742
Strict confidentiality.

26:31.743 --> 26:33.827
They take that
very seriously.

26:33.828 --> 26:35.479
I understand.

26:35.480 --> 26:37.497
They wanted to know
if you did anything unusual

26:37.498 --> 26:40.000
on tour the day
the guy died.

26:40.001 --> 26:41.919
Unusual? Like what?

26:41.920 --> 26:43.887
Like, did you stop
to make any phone calls

26:43.888 --> 26:45.222
arranging to meet anyone?

26:45.223 --> 26:48.291
Did you stop to make
any calls at a pay phone?

26:48.292 --> 26:51.361
Were you wearing
women's clothing on that day?

26:51.362 --> 26:53.463
What did you say?

26:53.464 --> 26:56.316
I said you wore
women's clothing every day.

26:58.102 --> 27:00.971
If you don't want to talk
about it, that's okay.

27:00.972 --> 27:02.806
I'll tell you this, kid,

27:02.807 --> 27:04.825
I think they're focused
on some woman.

27:04.826 --> 27:07.778
Yeah, I told them I have
no idea who she was.

27:07.779 --> 27:09.913
See? And that's going
to keep them curious.

27:09.914 --> 27:12.666
You know I goof around
a lot, right,

27:12.667 --> 27:15.369
but you'd be smart
to take my advice on this--

27:15.370 --> 27:17.371
tell them who she is.

27:17.372 --> 27:20.874
If you have to deal with
the fallout at home, so be it.

27:20.875 --> 27:22.993
Your girlfriend
can forgive you.

27:22.994 --> 27:24.828
But your name, your job...

27:24.829 --> 27:28.498
you lose that,
you'll never get it back.

27:28.499 --> 27:30.534
Yeah.

27:35.773 --> 27:37.708
JACKIE:
Look who came to dinner.

27:37.709 --> 27:39.876
Dr. Warren Wakefield

27:39.877 --> 27:41.862
and his lovely wife,
Nancy Wakefield.

27:41.863 --> 27:43.363
Pillars of society,
no doubt.

27:43.364 --> 27:46.016
Background check turned up
nothing on either one of them.

27:46.017 --> 27:48.235
You want to make a little wager

27:48.236 --> 27:50.587
on what Nancy Wakefield's
maiden name might be?

27:50.588 --> 27:52.406
- Yes, I do. Yes, I do.
- Great.

27:52.407 --> 27:54.041
I put ten dollars down
on Chiu.

27:54.042 --> 27:55.158
Really?

27:55.159 --> 27:56.693
Thinking it's
Nelson Chiu's sister?

27:56.694 --> 27:59.079
You got a ten on you?
Yep. Keep business all in the family.

27:59.080 --> 28:00.914
All right,
I'm gonna go with Eng.

28:00.915 --> 28:02.365
Really? Our friend Dennis Eng

28:02.366 --> 28:03.767
from the Munificent Society,
huh?

28:03.768 --> 28:06.903
Yeah. Press the button.
All right.

28:09.173 --> 28:10.373
Oh.

28:10.374 --> 28:11.975
Huh.
Eng, it is.

28:11.976 --> 28:14.244
Give me back my ten.

28:14.245 --> 28:16.413
Nah.
Huh.

28:18.216 --> 28:19.716
(door closing)

28:19.717 --> 28:21.918
Kind of late.

28:27.575 --> 28:31.495
I'm starting to wonder
if I did the right thing.

28:31.496 --> 28:34.664
Goes with the territory.

28:34.665 --> 28:36.867
The woman was screaming.

28:36.868 --> 28:39.236
I knew something bad
was going down.

28:39.237 --> 28:41.104
It was instinct.

28:41.105 --> 28:44.541
Any one of us would have
done the same thing, Jamie.

28:44.542 --> 28:47.544
Reagans don't punch out
at end of tour.

28:47.545 --> 28:50.213
That's why we became cops,
isn't it?

28:50.214 --> 28:52.816
The Academy teaches
you skills,

28:52.817 --> 28:54.818
the street gives you experience,

28:54.819 --> 28:57.621
but it all comes down
to your instinct.

28:58.423 --> 29:02.025
This Internal Affairs
thing is...

29:02.026 --> 29:05.062
It's starting to feel like
I'm the perp.

29:05.063 --> 29:07.964
You know I won't
talk about that.

29:11.803 --> 29:13.737
I'm not asking you to.

29:13.738 --> 29:17.874
I'm your father, but
I'm also your boss.

29:17.875 --> 29:21.044
I'm your son, but I'm
also an NYPD police officer.

29:21.045 --> 29:24.314
I think we're
stuck with that.

29:24.315 --> 29:28.185
Joe and Danny dealt with
this when they came on

29:28.186 --> 29:30.053
and I was on the force,

29:30.054 --> 29:33.723
but if they got jammed up...

29:33.724 --> 29:36.093
it wasn't front page news.

29:36.094 --> 29:39.229
You got the jackpot, Jamie.

29:39.230 --> 29:41.364
Your dad's the
police commissioner.

29:43.901 --> 29:45.836
It goes with the territory.

29:48.439 --> 29:49.706
(sighs)

29:49.707 --> 29:51.641
I know Lieutenant Bello.

29:51.642 --> 29:54.344
He's tough as they get.

29:54.345 --> 29:56.029
But he's fair.

29:56.030 --> 29:58.315
He investigated

29:58.316 --> 30:02.018
the guys in Joe's squad
when he was killed.

30:06.257 --> 30:08.358
You had anything
to eat?

30:08.359 --> 30:10.627
Pop made a meat loaf.

30:12.430 --> 30:15.849
No, I ought to...
I should get home.

30:16.717 --> 30:19.836
Jamie...

30:21.339 --> 30:24.174
Something else on your mind?

30:26.844 --> 30:28.678
Thanks, Dad.

30:57.008 --> 30:58.909
Jamie?

30:58.910 --> 31:00.310
What are you
doing up?

31:00.311 --> 31:03.513
It's 3:00
in the morning.

31:03.514 --> 31:05.115
Nothing.

31:10.755 --> 31:15.258
A Lieutenant Bello from I.A.
came to see me today.

31:15.259 --> 31:17.494
He, uh...

31:17.495 --> 31:20.564
asked me if we had
a fight yesterday,

31:20.565 --> 31:23.867
and if everything
was all right between us.

31:23.868 --> 31:28.238
And I told him
everything was fine.

31:31.309 --> 31:34.811
But the truth is, Jamie...

31:34.812 --> 31:37.647
I really don't know.

31:37.648 --> 31:41.017
Even when you're here,

31:41.018 --> 31:43.320
you're not here.

31:43.321 --> 31:45.822
That's not true, Syd.

31:56.767 --> 32:01.404
Jamie, my boss offered me
a really great opportunity

32:01.405 --> 32:04.641
to work on a big case
for the firm...

32:04.642 --> 32:08.411
in London for six months.

32:08.412 --> 32:11.998
London?

32:11.999 --> 32:14.668
Syd, look, I-I can't...

32:14.669 --> 32:16.002
I know you can't...

32:16.921 --> 32:20.223
Jamie...

32:20.224 --> 32:22.058
but I can.

32:22.059 --> 32:24.728
And, uh...

32:28.733 --> 32:31.935
I want to.

32:35.273 --> 32:37.641
Syd, I was meant
to do this job.

32:37.642 --> 32:38.975
I know that.

32:41.779 --> 32:43.947
And, uh...

32:43.948 --> 32:47.884
I love you too much
to stand in your way.

33:10.441 --> 33:12.892
Your Dr. Wakefield
is up to his neck in mortgages.

33:12.893 --> 33:14.394
Really?

33:14.395 --> 33:17.213
Yeah, he's hemorrhaging money
from houses here, the Hamptons.

33:17.214 --> 33:19.849
He's got a yacht,
flying privately.

33:19.850 --> 33:21.818
He's shelling out a lot
more money than he's

33:21.819 --> 33:23.153
taking in from his
private practice.

33:23.154 --> 33:24.988
How's he coming up
with the cash payments?

33:24.989 --> 33:26.706
Well, I saw that they
transferred ownership

33:26.707 --> 33:28.658
of the yacht to a holding
company in Gibraltar.

33:28.659 --> 33:30.877
The company's receiving
regular wire transfers--

33:30.878 --> 33:33.763
$60,000, $70,000
four or five times a month.

33:33.764 --> 33:36.700
$60,000, $75,000 a baby.

33:36.701 --> 33:39.803
Yeah. Last transfer
was five days ago.

33:39.804 --> 33:41.271
The couple paid by check.

33:41.272 --> 33:44.040
I got to run.
I'm late for court.

33:44.041 --> 33:45.708
Good work, sis.

33:45.709 --> 33:47.043
Their address
is in the file.

33:47.044 --> 33:49.045
Keep me updated.

33:49.046 --> 33:51.648
After we went through
four cycles of IVF,

33:51.649 --> 33:54.284
Dr. Wakefield suggested
we consider adoption.

33:54.285 --> 33:55.418
This Dr. Wakefield--

33:55.419 --> 33:58.121
did he suggest anything more
than that to you?

33:58.122 --> 34:02.525
Well, he recommended
we adopt a Chinese baby.

34:02.526 --> 34:04.470
MAN: He said that the babies
are always healthy

34:04.471 --> 34:06.198
because the mothers
don't smoke or do drugs.

34:06.297 --> 34:10.199
Um, that they're smart and they
excel in American society.

34:10.201 --> 34:14.504
Why are you asking us
about Dr. Wakefield?

34:14.505 --> 34:16.572
Uh, where did he say
that the baby was coming from?

34:16.574 --> 34:18.742
China, of course.

34:18.743 --> 34:21.511
Did he tell you how
you'd get the baby?

34:21.512 --> 34:25.514
He said that someone
would bring her to us.

34:25.516 --> 34:27.449
MAN: His wife is
Chinese and has

34:27.451 --> 34:28.851
political connections,

34:28.853 --> 34:31.254
so we wouldn't have to fly
to China to get our baby.

34:31.255 --> 34:32.989
Yeah, that's not the reason
you're not going to China.

34:32.989 --> 34:34.891
We believe that
your baby

34:34.891 --> 34:36.826
is coming to you from a place
much closer to home.

34:36.827 --> 34:39.262
There are women
in Chinatown

34:39.263 --> 34:41.664
who are being paid money to give
up their babies for adoption.

34:41.665 --> 34:43.233
Your baby's coming
from one of those women.

34:43.234 --> 34:44.367
Oh, dear God.

34:44.368 --> 34:45.568
Did they tell you

34:45.569 --> 34:47.437
when you could expect
the baby?

34:48.172 --> 34:51.074
Uh... any day now.

34:51.074 --> 34:53.543
Dr. Wakefield said
that the mother is due

34:53.543 --> 34:57.280
this week, and we would have
our baby soon after that.

35:00.251 --> 35:04.254
My God, are we gonna
lose this baby, too?

35:10.478 --> 35:11.978
Dr. Wakefield's
a real piece of work.

35:11.979 --> 35:14.397
That couple had no idea what they
were getting themselves into.

35:14.398 --> 35:15.432
Ming-Tai probably
didn't know

35:15.433 --> 35:16.649
what she was getting
herself into.

35:16.650 --> 35:19.102
Yeah, but you know,
a lot changes in nine months.

35:19.103 --> 35:22.105
She probably bonded with the
baby, decided not to give it up.

35:22.106 --> 35:24.107
The Triads don't want to hear
about maternal instinct.

35:24.108 --> 35:26.192
They want that baby,
they're gonna get it.

35:32.143 --> 35:34.544
This is a waste of my time.
I am not gonna say a word

35:34.545 --> 35:35.950
until our lawyer gets here.

35:35.951 --> 35:37.046
DANNY: Look, you want
to save your ass?

35:37.048 --> 35:38.515
You want to save
both your asses?

35:38.516 --> 35:39.933
Then you'll tell us
where Ming-Tai is

35:39.934 --> 35:41.418
before those Triad
goons find her, okay?

35:41.419 --> 35:43.187
'Cause then you're looking
at accessory to murder.

35:43.188 --> 35:44.555
- Okay.
- Murder?

35:44.556 --> 35:46.457
JACKIE: Ming-Tai changed her mind.
She doesn't want

35:46.458 --> 35:48.559
to give up her baby. What do you
think's gonna happen to her?

35:48.560 --> 35:50.277
- Warren.
- Honey, please.

35:50.278 --> 35:52.463
We are just gonna wait
until the lawyer gets here.

35:52.464 --> 35:53.764
DANNY:
That's a good idea, Doc.

35:53.765 --> 35:55.632
That way, by the
time he tells you

35:55.633 --> 35:57.284
to spill your guts anyway,
Ming-Tai'll be dead.

35:57.285 --> 35:58.802
When's she due,
by the way?

35:58.803 --> 36:00.737
- Soon.
- Honey, please,

36:00.738 --> 36:01.672
just shut up.

36:01.673 --> 36:02.706
OFFICER:
Detective.

36:02.707 --> 36:05.009
Excuse me.

36:05.010 --> 36:06.577
You know, don't worry about it.

36:06.578 --> 36:08.929
I mean, the baby's good
to go anyway.

36:08.930 --> 36:10.247
Who needs the mother, right?

36:10.248 --> 36:11.765
They'll just take
the baby out.

36:11.766 --> 36:12.883
Kill Ming-Tai.

36:12.884 --> 36:14.685
Dispose of the
body, whatever.

36:14.686 --> 36:17.321
Okay, the precinct squad is over
at the Munificent Society now

36:17.322 --> 36:19.256
and two officers are bringing in
Dennis Eng.

36:19.257 --> 36:21.725
DANNY: Beautiful.
All right,

36:21.726 --> 36:23.727
time for us to go
and arrest your brother.

36:23.728 --> 36:25.429
Sure you don't want
to say anything?

36:25.430 --> 36:26.730
No.

36:26.731 --> 36:28.699
Great.

36:30.335 --> 36:31.735
No, she's not there.

36:31.736 --> 36:33.153
Nancy, I said shut up!
She's not there!

36:33.154 --> 36:34.471
No, I said shut up.

36:34.472 --> 36:36.957
No, you shut up!
I said shut up!

36:36.958 --> 36:38.409
Now let her speak.

36:40.445 --> 36:41.879
(sighs)

36:44.082 --> 36:45.416
Go ahead.

36:45.417 --> 36:47.951
This all started with Dennis,
my brother.

36:47.952 --> 36:50.587
He'd see these girls
come into the center

36:50.588 --> 36:53.590
pregnant, no husband,
not a dime to their names.

36:53.591 --> 36:58.362
He came to us, said, "You know
all these rich white people

36:58.363 --> 37:01.198
"who can't have babies,
they could give a good life

37:01.199 --> 37:02.599
to these unwanted ones."

37:02.600 --> 37:06.820
But you do realize that selling
babies is illegal for a reason?

37:06.821 --> 37:09.373
It was supposed to benefit
the girls and us.

37:09.374 --> 37:14.111
But then Dennis got
the Triad involved,

37:14.112 --> 37:15.779
and now we pay
them a cut

37:15.780 --> 37:17.314
to keep their eyes
on the girls,

37:17.315 --> 37:20.184
make sure that they keep up
their end of the deal.

37:20.185 --> 37:21.418
Is this what's happening
to Ming-Tai?

37:21.419 --> 37:22.986
Yes, she's due today.

37:22.987 --> 37:24.421
Where are they?

37:24.422 --> 37:26.857
We need you to tell us
where they are.

37:26.858 --> 37:30.027
The Triad has their own doctor,
Dr. Yi.

37:30.028 --> 37:32.596
His office is at Bayard
and Mott Street.

37:37.535 --> 37:39.536
(muffled sobbing)

37:55.019 --> 37:56.069
(gunshot)

37:56.070 --> 37:59.156
Turn around, punk!
Police! Back up!

37:59.157 --> 38:00.491
Turn around, get against the wall!
(shouts)

38:00.492 --> 38:02.743
Get down! Stay down!

38:02.744 --> 38:04.694
- Stay down!
- Don't you move!

38:04.695 --> 38:05.546
Stay right there.

38:05.547 --> 38:07.397
It's okay. It's okay.

38:07.398 --> 38:08.665
I'm a police officer, okay?

38:08.666 --> 38:11.535
(gasping)
Are you Ming-Tai?
Are you Ming-Tai?

38:11.536 --> 38:13.337
My baby!
Are you Ming-Tai?

38:13.338 --> 38:14.338
My baby!

38:14.339 --> 38:16.140
DANNY:
It's all right.

38:16.141 --> 38:18.091
Your baby's gonna be okay.
Your baby's gonna be all right.

38:18.092 --> 38:20.677
My baby...
No one's gonna take your
baby away from you now.

38:20.678 --> 38:23.480
Manhattan detective.
We need a bus to this location.

38:23.481 --> 38:24.882
(sobbing)
It's okay.

38:24.883 --> 38:26.733
You're gonna be okay.
She's all right.

38:26.734 --> 38:29.753
You're gonna be all right.

38:29.754 --> 38:31.955
(sobbing continues)

38:31.956 --> 38:35.025
So, the woman you were seen
talking to in Chinatown

38:35.026 --> 38:37.694
on the night in question
has come forward.

38:37.695 --> 38:40.330
She has?

38:41.166 --> 38:43.734
Let's see what she has to say.

38:46.871 --> 38:49.473
Kathleen Ryan.

38:50.808 --> 38:52.910
I'm Lieutenant Bello.

38:52.911 --> 38:54.628
This is Officer
Jamison Reagan.

38:54.629 --> 38:57.014
Can you tell me

38:57.015 --> 38:59.916
if Officer Reagan
is the man you saw

38:59.917 --> 39:03.187
on Tuesday night?

39:03.188 --> 39:06.690
Well, he wasn't wearing
his uniform,

39:06.691 --> 39:09.359
but yes, that's him.

39:09.360 --> 39:12.763
And you had a
conversation

39:12.764 --> 39:14.565
with Officer Reagan.

39:14.566 --> 39:15.732
Is that correct?

39:15.733 --> 39:18.202
Well, not exactly
a conversation.

39:18.203 --> 39:21.305
I asked him for directions.

39:21.306 --> 39:24.675
Directions where?

39:24.676 --> 39:27.578
To Canal Street.

39:29.047 --> 39:31.515
I came to New York
from Pittsburgh to go shopping.

39:31.516 --> 39:34.818
I wanted to get a Gucci bag
for my sister and me.

39:34.819 --> 39:37.454
Honestly,
they're not real Gucci,

39:37.455 --> 39:39.256
but you can't tell
the difference.

39:39.257 --> 39:41.458
I hope that's not illegal.

39:41.459 --> 39:43.760
We don't have to worry about
that right now.

39:43.761 --> 39:47.264
What did you do after Officer
Reagan gave you directions?

39:47.265 --> 39:49.466
I started walking
to Canal Street.

39:49.467 --> 39:52.736
What did Officer Reagan do?

39:56.774 --> 39:59.176
I don't know.

40:04.349 --> 40:05.532
Okay.

40:05.533 --> 40:07.751
Thank you very much,
Miss Ryan.

40:09.871 --> 40:11.188
Officer Reagan helped me,

40:11.189 --> 40:13.156
and when I saw
the article in the paper,

40:13.157 --> 40:16.627
I just... I wanted to return
the favor.

40:18.229 --> 40:19.930
Thank you.

40:20.798 --> 40:23.500
(door opens)

40:23.501 --> 40:25.502
(door closes)
Well,

40:25.503 --> 40:28.071
I guess that wraps things up,
then.

40:33.811 --> 40:36.079
JACK:
<i>...through Christ our Lord.</i>

40:36.080 --> 40:37.014
Amen.

40:37.015 --> 40:38.448
ALL:
Amen.

40:38.449 --> 40:39.533
Good job.

40:39.534 --> 40:41.017
HENRY:
And pass the ammunition.

40:41.018 --> 40:43.520
Just one for me.
Thank you.

40:43.521 --> 40:44.454
(sneezes)

40:44.455 --> 40:45.656
- Bless you.
- Thanks.

40:45.657 --> 40:47.457
Have some more peas.

40:47.458 --> 40:50.026
Everybody, I have
an announcement.

40:50.027 --> 40:51.194
I've decided that I want

40:51.195 --> 40:53.497
to be the first female Reagan
to become a cop.

40:53.498 --> 40:55.799
HENRY:
Attagirl!

40:55.800 --> 40:57.167
No kidding, huh?

40:57.168 --> 40:58.201
Was that what that was
all about?

40:58.202 --> 40:59.469
LINDA:
What what was all about?

40:59.470 --> 41:00.804
Nicky was grilling me

41:00.805 --> 41:03.206
about why I became a lawyer
instead of a cop.

41:03.207 --> 41:04.975
And I appreciate
your honesty, Mom.

41:04.976 --> 41:06.209
Yeah, what'd you
tell her, Mom?

41:06.210 --> 41:07.928
It's because all of
us cops are stupid

41:07.929 --> 41:10.380
and you're such a genius?
Yeah, basically

41:10.381 --> 41:11.581
She said she didn't
feel the call.

41:11.582 --> 41:12.949
Kind of like being
a priest in that way.

41:12.950 --> 41:15.068
But only in that way.
Amen.

41:15.069 --> 41:18.021
And while I think it would
be fun to be a lawyer...

41:18.022 --> 41:19.556
Yeah, barrel of laughs,
being a lawyer.

41:19.557 --> 41:22.092
...I want to carry on
the tradition

41:22.093 --> 41:23.226
that Great-Grandpa
Henry started

41:23.227 --> 41:26.113
and Grandpa passed on
to Uncle Danny, Uncle Joe

41:26.114 --> 41:27.080
and now to Uncle Jamie.

41:27.081 --> 41:28.965
- I want to be a cop, too.
- God help me.

41:28.966 --> 41:31.601
DANNY:
Come on. Am I that bad?

41:31.602 --> 41:32.669
JACK:
Mom, is it because

41:32.670 --> 41:34.938
it was so sad when Uncle Joe
got killed?

41:42.814 --> 41:44.848
That's a big part
of it, honey.

41:44.849 --> 41:46.099
Okay.

41:48.803 --> 41:51.138
Hey, Jamie, we got your
favorite-- pot roast.

41:51.139 --> 41:52.823
Sorry I'm late.

41:52.824 --> 41:54.441
No Sydney?

41:54.442 --> 41:56.193
No.

42:01.098 --> 42:02.666
Hey, Jamie...

42:02.667 --> 42:05.369
your niece just said that
she wants to be a cop

42:05.370 --> 42:07.371
and carry on
the family tradition.

42:07.372 --> 42:09.339
What do you think,
Uncle Jamie?

42:09.340 --> 42:12.109
It's complicated.

42:12.110 --> 42:13.493
It's a commitment.

42:13.494 --> 42:16.480
It's not just a job,

42:16.481 --> 42:17.748
it's your whole life.

42:17.749 --> 42:20.500
And you're not just a cop,
you're a Reagan.

42:23.354 --> 42:26.089
In a lot of ways, I didn't know
what I was getting into.

42:29.861 --> 42:31.812
But I wouldn't trade it.

42:34.632 --> 42:36.483
None of us would, kid.

42:36.484 --> 42:38.702
Damn straight.

42:41.072 --> 42:43.807
Well said, son.

42:47.695 --> 42:49.346
HENRY:
I didn't get any peas.

42:49.347 --> 42:50.414
(women laugh)
