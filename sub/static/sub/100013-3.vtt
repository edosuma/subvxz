Though it is a bit
of a sad story.

Um, my mother's hat collection
fell on top of him,

by the hats.

<i>can I come back yet?</i>

15:34.200 --> 15:36.400
<i>SHONA: No,</i>
<i>I left you an hour ago.</i>

15:36.400 --> 15:38.600
<i>Are you still with David?</i>
AINE: Course I am.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.880
I've nothing else to
do that doesn't cost cash.

15:40.880 --> 15:42.280
‐ Just...
[sighs]

15:42.280 --> 15:43.720
Just stay out till 10:00‐ish,
okay?

15:43.720 --> 15:45.400
Have a laugh.

15:45.400 --> 15:46.640
Don't sleep with him, though.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.800
AINE: Yeah, right.
You'd love that.

15:48.800 --> 15:50.800
Then I could not
come back to your house.

15:50.800 --> 15:51.960
<i>SHONA: Don't get drunk.</i>

15:51.960 --> 15:53.120
And get a taxi home.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.200
Don't walk or I'll kill ya.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.360
Okay, bye.
Love you.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.760
That was quick.
Did you wash your hands?

15:59.760 --> 16:03.240
‐ Uh, no, I didn't need to
'cause it was so quick.

16:03.240 --> 16:04.480
Are you sure you
don't want any food?

16:04.480 --> 16:06.080
Only I've got an empty belly.

16:06.080 --> 16:08.120
<i>[Scottish accent]</i>
<i>Get in my belly, food.</i>

16:08.120 --> 16:09.760
‐ Yeah, go on,
I'll go for food with you.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.240
‐ Oh yes, get in. [chuckles]

16:11.240 --> 16:12.400
‐ Do you wanna
do some shots first, though?

16:12.400 --> 16:14.280
‐ Yeah, shots?

16:14.280 --> 16:15.960
Uh, I've actually
never done shots before.

16:17.480 --> 16:20.120
SHONA: Sorry.

16:20.120 --> 16:21.880
‐ Drama?
SHONA: No.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.880
Why, does Freddie
say she comes with drama?

16:23.880 --> 16:25.840
Shouldn't even be talking
about her, d'you know that?

16:25.840 --> 16:27.360
Bloody ass clown.

16:27.360 --> 16:28.800
CHARLOTTE: No, honestly,
he didn't say anything.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.440
That's‐‐
that's not what I meant.

16:30.440 --> 16:32.400
He's actually been
asking how she is a few times.

16:32.400 --> 16:36.640
SHONA: Ah.
‐ But I know
he's enemy number one.

16:36.640 --> 16:39.200
Think he's
seeing someone new now.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.480
‐ Is he?
Who?

16:41.480 --> 16:43.360
‐ Maybe I shouldn't have
said anything.

16:43.360 --> 16:44.720
‐ No, it's...
[groans]

16:44.720 --> 16:46.240
God, did I need to know that?

16:46.240 --> 16:49.000
[groans]

16:49.000 --> 16:50.800
I don't think
she needs to know that.

16:50.800 --> 16:54.120
She‐‐she's just,
she's had a bit of a...

16:54.120 --> 16:55.560
tough run of it, you know.

16:55.560 --> 16:57.840
I mean, she's great now,
but it's...

16:57.840 --> 17:00.400
‐ Does she get depressed?

17:00.400 --> 17:02.200
‐ Um...

17:02.200 --> 17:06.160
No.
I mean, no more
than the rest of us.

17:06.160 --> 17:08.800
‐ I get it, I...

17:08.800 --> 17:12.440
I mean, my brain's a bit shit
but I‐‐I take stuff for it

17:12.440 --> 17:14.800
and I see a guy and‐‐

17:14.800 --> 17:18.000
and now I'm, I'm totally fine
all the time.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.120
Except when I...

17:19.120 --> 17:20.800
[chuckles]
Turn on the news,

17:20.800 --> 17:22.120
scroll through Twitter,

17:22.120 --> 17:23.400
and then I wanna
jump off a cliff.

17:23.400 --> 17:26.400
‐ [sighs]

17:29.200 --> 17:31.400
Well, I mean,

17:31.400 --> 17:33.000
she's totally fine now,

17:33.000 --> 17:34.720
but, um...

17:34.720 --> 17:38.600
Last year, she, um...

17:38.600 --> 17:42.600
Well, we think she tried to...

17:42.600 --> 17:45.000
But I got her in somewhere
for a couple of weeks and,

17:45.000 --> 17:48.400
you know, she's, it's just‐‐
it was really scary, though.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.840
‐ Yeah.

17:50.840 --> 17:54.200
‐ [sighs]

17:54.200 --> 17:57.000
So, that's why, um,

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
with the phone, like, you know.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.600
Like, I know she's in the pub,
you know, where we were,

18:01.600 --> 18:03.320
so I'm like "Phew.

18:03.320 --> 18:04.680
I don't need to worry."

18:05.800 --> 18:07.080
[sniffles]

18:09.440 --> 18:11.280
Okay.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.080
AINE: Wa, wa, wa.
We need to keep eating steak.

18:13.080 --> 18:15.400
Do you know, actually, have you
watched <i>The West Wing?</i>

18:15.400 --> 18:17.000
Oh my God,
because actually, apparently,

18:17.000 --> 18:19.760
that's exactly what
it's like in the government,

18:19.760 --> 18:21.120
in the White House in America.

18:21.120 --> 18:22.640
So it's very interesting.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.800
‐ Mmm.
‐ God,
this place is so random.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.040
Why did you pick here
for eating?

18:27.040 --> 18:30.400
‐ 'Cause my place
is upstairs.

18:30.400 --> 18:34.000
‐ Your place is upstairs.

18:34.000 --> 18:39.200
Oh my God, how do I end up
in these fucking situations?

18:39.200 --> 18:42.800
Shona, that's how.
Right, okay.

18:42.800 --> 18:45.200
Right, yes, yes, yes, okay.

18:45.200 --> 18:48.000
David, pretend to
have your mind blown.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.720
‐ What, do you mean
prepare to have my mind blown?

18:49.720 --> 18:51.600
‐ Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah...

18:51.600 --> 18:54.600
[both groaning]

18:59.000 --> 19:01.600
That's my gift to you,
there, David.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.800
Um, I've had a lovely evening.

19:03.800 --> 19:05.640
Thanks very much for paying for
everything

19:05.640 --> 19:07.600
but,
I think you'll agree,

19:07.600 --> 19:10.400
that you got your money's worth
and it's time for me to go.

19:10.400 --> 19:14.360
And never call me again,
okay, thank you.

19:14.360 --> 19:16.720
You should post
something on that door, man.

19:16.720 --> 19:17.720
Mister.

19:17.720 --> 19:20.720
[person singing]

19:25.640 --> 19:28.400
AINE: Oh my God.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.200
[Shona sighs]

19:41.200 --> 19:42.320
[door thuds shut]

19:42.320 --> 19:45.320
[distant singing and muttering]

19:49.160 --> 19:50.440
AINE: Come here to me.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.160
You're not going to rape me,
are you?

19:52.160 --> 19:54.080
PATRICK: Ah, no.
I wish!

19:54.080 --> 19:57.080
[Aine and Patrick laugh]

20:02.000 --> 20:03.960
AINE: Madman.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.800
Ow!
SHONA: What the fuck
are you doing?

20:07.800 --> 20:09.480
Who the fuck is
that on my couch?

20:09.480 --> 20:12.400
AINE: He's, uh, my neighbor,
and he's Irish, Shona.

20:12.400 --> 20:14.000
He's‐‐
SHONA: What?
AINE: He's harmless.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.880
SHONA: Jesus Christ!
AINE: He was lost.

20:15.880 --> 20:17.880
SHONA: Do you have any
idea how dangerous that is?

20:17.880 --> 20:20.600
‐ Shona,
he wouldn't hurt a fly.
‐ Oh.

20:20.600 --> 20:23.800
‐ And he's the only person
in the world
who cares about me,

20:23.800 --> 20:25.880
and he's alone.
‐ Oh, my God.

20:25.880 --> 20:29.000
AINE: So‐‐but if you want to
kick him out

20:29.000 --> 20:31.320
onto the street,
then just do it.

20:31.320 --> 20:34.000
SHONA: I am gonna kill you
in the morning.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.400
What would Vish say
if he knew about that?

20:35.400 --> 20:37.000
He could rape us!

20:37.000 --> 20:38.080
‐ Vish would rape us?

20:38.080 --> 20:39.800
‐ The man on the sofa!

20:39.800 --> 20:42.000
‐ His name is...

20:42.000 --> 20:43.800
Pat,

20:43.800 --> 20:46.400
and he promised
he wouldn't.

20:46.400 --> 20:49.640
‐ I am gonna lock my door,

20:49.640 --> 20:51.720
okay, my own fucking
bedroom door

20:51.720 --> 20:57.000
because he is drunk and
you are drunk and I'm drunk.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
But you are a fucking idiot,
Aine.

21:01.880 --> 21:05.000
I am so fucking
angry with you right now!

21:14.800 --> 21:17.960
[creaking]

21:17.960 --> 21:20.960
[creaking continues,
Shona sighs]

21:26.880 --> 21:29.880
[cell phone ringing]

21:31.000 --> 21:34.520
‐ [sighs]
What?

21:34.520 --> 21:36.480
AINE: Let me in.

21:36.480 --> 21:37.480
[sighs]

21:43.920 --> 21:46.320
[distant snoring]

21:46.320 --> 21:50.960
AINE: I'm sorry, Sho.

21:50.960 --> 21:53.040
‐ [sighs]
‐ Please, sissy wissy,

21:53.040 --> 21:57.200
don't be angry with me.

21:57.200 --> 22:00.000
I'm only a wittle girl.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.600
And I really don't think
he'd have sex with you

22:01.600 --> 22:03.400
if he saw you
with your retainer in.

22:03.400 --> 22:05.600
[both laugh]

22:05.600 --> 22:08.240
‐ It's not funny, Aine!
‐ [groans]

22:08.240 --> 22:09.400
‐ It's so dangerous!

22:09.400 --> 22:10.800
‐ I know, I know.

22:10.800 --> 22:12.760
I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry, so sorry.

22:12.760 --> 22:15.200
So sorry, so sorry.

22:17.800 --> 22:19.800
Do you think Vish likes me?

22:21.600 --> 22:23.400
‐ What?
AINE: Nothing.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.600
‐ How was the rest of
the night with David, anyway?

22:30.600 --> 22:33.600
‐ Oh my God.
Bore fest.

22:33.600 --> 22:34.800
[Shona snorts, chuckles]
AINE: Never again.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.400
So boring!
[Aine laughs]

22:36.400 --> 22:38.200
‐ I'm so glad.

22:38.200 --> 22:40.400
[Aine sighs]

22:40.400 --> 22:43.400
‐ Mam'll be delighted
you did it, anyway.

22:43.400 --> 22:45.800
‐ How d'you mean?

22:45.800 --> 22:47.560
‐ That you
went out with him.

22:47.560 --> 22:51.000
She can tell the family we
took our cousin out, you know.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.800
Showed him a good time
and made an effort.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.800
‐ Shona.

23:00.800 --> 23:01.800
‐ What?

23:03.600 --> 23:05.600
‐ I think
I'm gonna be sick.
