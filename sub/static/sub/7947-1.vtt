So why don't you just stay there
and do your drinking on campus?

10:19.369 --> 10:20.787
Why do you have to come into town?

10:20.912 --> 10:22.789
Well, I mean, we live in this town, too.

10:22.914 --> 10:25.083
I mean, we don't have
to just stay on campus.

10:25.208 --> 10:26.960
Yeah...

10:27.085 --> 10:29.296
and it's scum like you
that are killing this town.

Come on, come on, Curt.
Now, just take it easy.

10:33.216 --> 10:35.344
What's the matter, Dave?

10:35.469 --> 10:38.889
You got a thing for these little boys?
Empty your pockets!

10:41.058 --> 10:42.643
We just had a little wine.
What's the problem?

10:42.768 --> 10:44.227
You're the problem, you little shit!

10:44.353 --> 10:47.564
Just lighten up, Mooney.
Just lighten up.

10:47.689 --> 10:49.524

10:49.650 --> 10:51.485
Open container, public intoxication,

10:51.610 --> 10:54.112
littering, disturbing the peace,
resisting arrest...

10:54.237 --> 10:56.365
These kids are history.

10:57.366 --> 10:59.910
Unless you want to rewrite the laws,
Mr. Police Academy.

11:00.035 --> 11:02.913
Look. You got this problem
with my training, I don't care,

11:03.038 --> 11:04.414
but when you bring someone
into the station,

11:04.539 --> 11:06.166
I don't want to see you
beating them up.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.669
Now, if you're going to book them,
do it according to procedure,

11:08.794 --> 11:12.673
or I swear, Curt, you and that badge
of yours will be history.

11:12.798 --> 11:15.133
I'll tell you what's going
to be history, Dave.

11:52.379 --> 11:55.757
- Uh-huh.
- Path lie...

11:56.883 --> 11:58.427

11:58.552 --> 12:01.304
We must travel many moons...

12:01.430 --> 12:04.307
many, many moons.

12:04.433 --> 12:05.726
Many...

12:05.851 --> 12:07.686

Enough already with the moons.

12:10.689 --> 12:13.692
Lead the way,
Chief Running-at-the-mouth.

12:28.457 --> 12:30.000
Holy shit.

12:30.459 --> 12:33.462
That was no shooting star.
Looks like a...

12:33.587 --> 12:35.464
Circus tent.

12:35.589 --> 12:37.966
What's a circus tent doing
all the way out here?

12:38.091 --> 12:40.010
It's a pretty lousy location for a show.

12:40.552 --> 12:43.096
Something's wrong.
This doesn't feel right.

12:43.221 --> 12:45.390
Weren't we looking
for the shooting star?

12:45.515 --> 12:47.434
Come on, this looks neat.
Let's check this out.

12:47.559 --> 12:50.729
No, let's go. I've seen enough.

12:50.854 --> 12:52.397
Oh, come on, Deb.

12:53.732 --> 12:57.068
I want to take a closer look.
You can stay here.

12:57.194 --> 12:58.320
Alone?

12:58.445 --> 13:01.865
Well, would you be more scared
if you came with me

13:01.990 --> 13:03.825
or if I left you here?

13:05.035 --> 13:06.661
If you left me here.

13:06.787 --> 13:08.205
Let's go.

13:16.546 --> 13:18.632
Come on.
(Laughs) Come on.

13:18.757 --> 13:21.343
OK, OK. I'm coming.

13:32.354 --> 13:34.147

Don't be a baby.

13:53.416 --> 13:56.503

14:10.851 --> 14:12.978
Don't be shy. Don't be stupid.

14:13.103 --> 14:16.648
Come see the incredible Miss 50-50,

14:20.068 --> 14:21.778
That's right, little lady.
Step right up here

14:21.903 --> 14:24.030
and see Gumbo,
the toothless elephant.

14:24.155 --> 14:27.200
Or right over here,
we've got Belinda, the bulimic wonder.

14:27.325 --> 14:30.662
Watch her binge and purge
before your very eyes. Ha!

14:30.787 --> 14:33.790
Mike, keep it down.
Somebody will catch us.

14:33.915 --> 14:36.084
God, is this place great or what?

14:36.209 --> 14:39.588
I mean, it looks like it was decorated
by Clowns "R" Us.

14:40.839 --> 14:42.048
I don't know.

14:44.301 --> 14:46.303
So, how much further you want to go?

14:47.053 --> 14:50.640
Let's just go down to the end
of this hall where those doors are.

14:51.516 --> 14:52.642
Come on.

15:08.533 --> 15:11.244
(Clown horn sounds)

15:14.581 --> 15:16.875
- (Machinery whirring)
- (Both yell)

15:27.594 --> 15:29.262
This is no funhouse.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.848
No circus, either.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.897
- (Fizzling)
- (Debbie screams)

15:40.273 --> 15:41.441
What?

15:42.567 --> 15:44.361
I can't believe it.

15:44.486 --> 15:46.613
What is it, a nuclear power plant?

15:46.738 --> 15:47.781
No.

15:47.906 --> 15:49.199
A missile silo?

15:49.324 --> 15:50.367
No.

15:50.492 --> 15:51.826
A military base?

15:52.410 --> 15:53.495
No! No!

15:59.793 --> 16:02.420
- The shooting star!
- What are you talking about?

16:02.545 --> 16:05.757
The shooting star
we went to go look for... we are in it.

16:07.425 --> 16:08.843
What was that?

16:08.969 --> 16:11.721
- I don't know...
- (Footsteps approaching)

16:12.931 --> 16:14.599
...but it's coming this way.

16:14.724 --> 16:15.809
Here. Come on.

16:29.364 --> 16:32.242
(Liquid bubbling)

16:33.994 --> 16:35.787
Look at this place.

16:39.708 --> 16:41.668
It smells like candy.

16:42.502 --> 16:46.256
You know, I don't know
what we saw out there before, but...

16:46.381 --> 16:49.801
this looks like
a cotton candy factory to me.

16:50.927 --> 16:52.095
Yeah.

16:52.220 --> 16:54.681
This must be where
they hang it up to dry

16:54.806 --> 16:56.307
before they ship the stuff out.

16:56.433 --> 16:57.517
No, it's not.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.354
I've never seen
anything like this before, have you?

17:01.855 --> 17:02.939
No.

17:03.064 --> 17:05.400
Well, that's because nobody has.

17:07.402 --> 17:11.781
I don't believe in UFOs,
but if they do exist,

17:11.906 --> 17:14.409
then we're trapped in one right now.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.492
Will you just calm down?

17:15.617 --> 17:17.619
There's got to be
a logical explanation for this.

17:18.246 --> 17:20.080
This isn't what you think it is.

17:21.499 --> 17:24.252
Nobody stores cotton candy like this.

17:24.961 --> 17:27.422
What are you talking about?
Of course it is.

17:27.547 --> 17:28.923
(Laughs) Look.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.842
(Screams, gasps)

18:03.124 --> 18:04.959
(Whirring)

18:11.466 --> 18:12.717
Joe Lombardo.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.439
Down this way.

18:33.404 --> 18:34.656
(Grunts)

18:43.706 --> 18:44.999
(Both yell)

18:45.125 --> 18:47.252
- Are you OK?
- I think so.

18:47.377 --> 18:48.753
Come on.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.505
Popcorn. Why popcorn?

18:50.630 --> 18:52.841
Because they're clowns, that's why.

18:54.050 --> 18:56.761
(Speaking alien language)

18:58.346 --> 18:59.764
(Panting)

19:04.477 --> 19:05.895
(Speaking alien language)

19:11.526 --> 19:13.528
(Barking)

19:22.620 --> 19:24.372
(Screams)

19:24.622 --> 19:26.291
(Dog barking)

19:26.541 --> 19:27.917
(Grunting, screaming)

19:28.042 --> 19:29.669
Mike, get me out of here!

19:29.794 --> 19:32.130
(Barking, panting)

19:33.756 --> 19:35.091
(Howling)

19:35.800 --> 19:37.552
(Debbie) Hurry, they're coming!

19:38.553 --> 19:40.513
- (Engine revving)
- (Barking)

19:40.638 --> 19:42.473
(Grunting)

19:42.599 --> 19:44.726
(Tires squealing)

19:44.851 --> 19:46.311
- (Yelling)
- (Screaming)

19:46.436 --> 19:49.439
- (Speaking alien language)
- (Screaming)

20:09.209 --> 20:11.044
(Debbie) We have to tell the police.

20:11.169 --> 20:13.296
We're going to run to the police
and tell them there's a bunch of clowns

20:13.379 --> 20:15.381
running around the hills,
killing people with cotton candy?

20:15.506 --> 20:17.425
I have a friend there.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.510
I know he'll believe us.

20:19.636 --> 20:22.013
I don't know, Debbie.
I wouldn't even believe us.

20:32.607 --> 20:34.400
(Speaking alien language)

20:57.131 --> 20:58.675
(Tires squealing)

21:00.426 --> 21:01.970
What the heck?

21:04.138 --> 21:05.556
(Horn honking)

21:10.895 --> 21:14.399
Dave! Oh, my God! Something horrible
has happened! Somebody's been killed!

21:14.524 --> 21:15.984
Wait a second, Debbie.
What happened?

21:16.109 --> 21:18.653
You gotta help us!
There are two people dead!

21:18.778 --> 21:20.947
- Who, Debbie? Who's dead?
- Joe Lombardo. He's dead.

21:21.072 --> 21:22.240
And some old man, too.

21:22.365 --> 21:23.825
Wait a second, guys.
Are you sure about this?

21:23.950 --> 21:25.576
Yes! It... they were hanging there

21:25.702 --> 21:27.704
wrapped up
in these cotton candy things...

21:27.829 --> 21:29.372
these... cocoons.

21:29.497 --> 21:31.582
- Cocoons?
- Yes, cocoons.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.084
You know, cocoons.

21:33.209 --> 21:34.752
All right, everybody calm down.

21:34.877 --> 21:37.255
Look, Debbie,
come inside and explain this to me.

21:37.380 --> 21:38.673
I'd like to help you, but before I can,

21:38.798 --> 21:41.092
I've got to understand
what's going on here myself.

21:53.229 --> 21:56.190
(Woman) I really need
to get some mascara, OK?

21:57.358 --> 21:59.569
OK, why don't we just go
to the drugstore?

21:59.694 --> 22:01.237
OK. And then we'll go on.

22:03.531 --> 22:04.699
Look.

22:11.497 --> 22:12.540
Cute.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.548
(Speaking alien language)

22:21.132 --> 22:22.342
All right, sit down.

22:23.301 --> 22:25.553
Let's start from the beginning, all right?

22:25.678 --> 22:27.263
OK, OK.

22:27.388 --> 22:28.931
We were up at the Top of the World,

22:29.057 --> 22:32.518
and we saw this shooting star,
and we decided to go look for it.

22:32.643 --> 22:36.314
But instead of finding the shooting star,
we saw this... this circus tent.

22:36.439 --> 22:38.941
And that's when we went inside,
and we saw all those people

22:39.067 --> 22:41.611
in those...
those pink cotton candy cocoons.

22:41.736 --> 22:45.156
Dave, it was not a circus tent.
It was something else.

22:45.281 --> 22:47.241
- What? What?
- (Mike) It was a spaceship.

22:47.367 --> 22:49.827
And there was these things,
these... killer clowns,

22:49.952 --> 22:51.162
and they shot popcorn at us.

22:51.287 --> 22:52.705
We barely got away.

22:52.830 --> 22:54.957
(Whistles)

22:55.708 --> 22:58.378
Killer clowns from outer space?

22:59.128 --> 23:00.880
Holy shit.

23:01.005 --> 23:04.008
Dave, we are telling you the truth.
You've got to believe us.

23:04.133 --> 23:05.593
Let me tell you something, honey.

23:05.718 --> 23:08.554
I was just over there.
There's nothing going on.

23:08.679 --> 23:11.265
Excuse me, please,
but we're talking to Dave.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.976
Now, just hold on a second, Mooney.
They say some people are dead.

23:14.102 --> 23:18.272
- Let's hear them out.
- All right, Dave. OK.

23:18.398 --> 23:22.110
Clowns, cotton candy, flying popcorn.

23:22.235 --> 23:25.571
Go ahead. Let them make fools
out of the police department.

23:25.696 --> 23:28.825
I told you, I was just over there!
You going to believe this little tramp?

23:28.950 --> 23:30.868
Come on, Mooney!

23:30.993 --> 23:32.995
I'm handling this, all right?

23:36.124 --> 23:39.460
All right, all right, Debbie,
who's your friend?

23:39.585 --> 23:41.504
(Debbie) Mike. We go to school together.

23:41.629 --> 23:44.424
You two were up
at Top of the World together?

23:44.966 --> 23:46.008
Yeah.

23:47.468 --> 23:49.554
I know you, you little fart.

23:49.971 --> 23:53.266
You hang out
with the Terenzi brothers.

23:53.391 --> 23:56.144
Clowns? I get it.

23:56.269 --> 23:58.563
Another one of their stupid stunts
to sell ice cream

23:58.688 --> 24:01.607
from that goddamn truck
those hoodlums run around in.

24:01.732 --> 24:03.234
Well, now I really believe this.

24:03.359 --> 24:05.153
Well, you better go now, Dave,

24:05.278 --> 24:07.321
before the clowns take over, huh?

24:07.447 --> 24:09.532
And when you get back
from saving the world,

24:09.657 --> 24:10.783
I want a full written report

24:10.908 --> 24:14.078
so I can give it to the chief
when he gets back on Monday.

24:14.203 --> 24:15.580
(Laughing)

24:15.705 --> 24:18.249
Look, everything happened
just the way we said.

24:18.374 --> 24:19.792
We are telling you the truth.

24:19.917 --> 24:21.419
All right, all right.

24:21.544 --> 24:22.587
You two come with me.

24:22.712 --> 24:24.088
- (Mooney chuckles)
- Come on.

24:24.213 --> 24:26.883
Hurry up, Dave.
Don't let them get away.

24:27.925 --> 24:29.385
Go ahead, Dave...

24:30.511 --> 24:32.555
...make a dummy out of yourself.

24:33.681 --> 24:36.017
But you're not going
to make a dummy out of me.

24:38.519 --> 24:40.021
You, in the back.

25:17.683 --> 25:19.810
(Squeaking)

25:40.498 --> 25:41.624
(Man chuckles)

25:41.749 --> 25:44.210
(Laughing)

25:48.005 --> 25:51.217
Uh... Oh... Um...

25:52.552 --> 25:54.053
(Laughs nervously)

25:55.555 --> 25:57.390
Whoa! Oh...

25:58.266 --> 26:01.519
(Screaming)

26:03.354 --> 26:05.606
(Cackling)

26:08.192 --> 26:10.278
(Stammering)

26:10.403 --> 26:11.571
Excuse me.

26:11.696 --> 26:14.115
Oh. Oh, my.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.741
May I help you?

26:22.540 --> 26:24.250
Oh, no!

26:39.932 --> 26:41.767
(Grumbles)

26:45.271 --> 26:46.731
Oh, no.

26:50.985 --> 26:52.820
(Dave) All right, we're going up there
to check this out.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.488
First, I'm taking you home, Debbie.

26:54.614 --> 26:57.491
No way.
I'm going back up there with you.

26:57.617 --> 26:59.076
You can't tell me what to do.

26:59.201 --> 27:00.578
Debbie, just listen to me, would you?

27:00.703 --> 27:02.622
I don't have to listen to you.

27:02.747 --> 27:05.166
You are not
my boyfriend anymore, all right?

27:05.291 --> 27:07.668
Yeah, that's right.
I'm not your boyfriend anymore.

27:07.793 --> 27:10.296
That doesn't change
the way I feel about you, though.

27:10.421 --> 27:12.465
Dave, please.

27:12.590 --> 27:14.675
Don't do this to me.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.636
All right, Debbie, you got a choice.

27:16.761 --> 27:18.012
Either go home,
or I'm going to take you

27:18.137 --> 27:20.973
back to the station and lock you up
for safekeeping. How's that?

27:21.098 --> 27:22.808
(Sighs)

27:22.933 --> 27:25.394
(Doorbell rings)

27:25.519 --> 27:26.979
(Alien voice) Pizza!

27:28.648 --> 27:30.775
Oh. Pizza.

27:30.900 --> 27:33.402
Uh-huh. (Chuckles)

27:33.527 --> 27:35.946
- (Yelling)
- (Whimpers)

27:38.491 --> 27:40.826
(Clown cackling)

27:44.914 --> 27:46.749
(Doorbell rings)

27:49.335 --> 27:52.088
- (Alien voice) For you.
- Oh! For me?

27:53.172 --> 27:54.548
Oh!

27:54.674 --> 27:58.678
Oh, Jim... is this from you?

27:59.553 --> 28:01.347
- Huh?
- (Woman) Oh!

28:01.472 --> 28:03.349
(Grunts)

28:09.563 --> 28:11.023
Look, Debbie...

28:11.565 --> 28:13.901
May I please speak to Mike outside?

28:15.486 --> 28:17.947
Fine. Sure.

28:18.072 --> 28:19.407
Thank you.

28:28.332 --> 28:29.709
Your old boyfriend? This is great.

28:29.834 --> 28:31.627
Will you come here?

28:33.671 --> 28:36.090
He's probably going to take me up
on top of the hill and shoot me.

28:36.215 --> 28:37.967
Look, don't worry about Dave.

28:38.092 --> 28:41.470
It's those clowns
you got to worry about.

28:41.595 --> 28:45.433
Listen, as soon as you guys leave here,
I'm going to follow you guys up there.

28:45.558 --> 28:46.767
You're going
to follow us up there?

28:46.892 --> 28:49.311
Debbie, I don't even
want to go up there.

28:49.437 --> 28:51.772
Listen, you stay inside the house
and keep the door locked.

28:51.897 --> 28:54.525
I'll be back here in a little bit
to check on you.

28:55.526 --> 28:56.527
OK?

28:58.404 --> 28:59.864
You better.

29:09.707 --> 29:11.459
That's good timing.

29:43.324 --> 29:45.034
Oh!

29:48.871 --> 29:51.415
(Grunting)

29:54.668 --> 29:56.587
Oh!

30:06.514 --> 30:08.849
(Gasping, sneezes)

30:17.274 --> 30:18.818
Wait a minute.

30:19.819 --> 30:21.153
Where is it?

30:21.278 --> 30:22.613
Yeah, that's what I'd like to know, pal.

30:22.738 --> 30:24.323
It was right there where that hole is.

30:24.448 --> 30:25.699
So are you saying that hole
is where the tent was?

30:25.825 --> 30:27.576
The tent made that hole...
is that what you're telling me?

30:27.701 --> 30:29.119
Yes! It was there.

30:29.245 --> 30:30.496
Look, we saw it.
That's a fact.

30:30.621 --> 30:32.248
I'll tell you what the facts are, mister.

30:32.373 --> 30:34.834
You said people are being killed.
Now, where are the bodies?

30:34.959 --> 30:36.669
I don't know.
I saw Joe Lombardo dead.

30:36.794 --> 30:38.003
I can only tell you what I think I saw.

30:38.128 --> 30:39.880
Oh, so now you just think you saw?

30:40.005 --> 30:41.173
No! I know what I saw.

30:41.298 --> 30:42.883
I just can't prove it. My proof is gone.

30:43.008 --> 30:44.176
Yeah, right. Turn around, pal.

30:45.886 --> 30:47.346
Mooney was right, huh?

30:47.471 --> 30:49.139
Got nothing better to do
but cause problems.

30:49.265 --> 30:50.724
Well, you're not going
to get away with it this time.

30:50.850 --> 30:53.310
Get away with what?
Debbie saw it, too.

30:53.435 --> 30:55.145
- Yeah, she did, didn't she?
- Ow!

30:55.271 --> 30:56.313
Come on.

31:01.068 --> 31:02.778
Hey, Eddie, is that a new bike you got?

31:02.903 --> 31:04.613
(Woman) What's happening, Spike?

31:05.990 --> 31:08.075
(Speaking alien language)

31:11.745 --> 31:15.082
(Laughing)

31:15.207 --> 31:17.459
Oh! (Laughs)

31:17.585 --> 31:20.421
Big bad Jojo comin' into town.

31:21.297 --> 31:22.464
Watch this, baby.

31:22.590 --> 31:24.258
Is that bike too big for you?

31:24.383 --> 31:25.843
Hey, Patty!

31:29.179 --> 31:30.389
Mean bike you got there.

31:30.514 --> 31:31.807
(All) Yeah.

31:33.809 --> 31:37.771
- Can I take a ride, pal?
- Uh-uh!

31:37.897 --> 31:39.481
(Crowd laughing)

31:39.607 --> 31:41.442
Can I beep the horn?

31:41.567 --> 31:43.193
Mm-hm.

31:44.445 --> 31:47.531
Oh, thank you! (Laughs)

31:48.532 --> 31:50.200
(Laughing)

31:53.203 --> 31:56.790
He should've let the man
ride his bike. (Laughing)

31:56.916 --> 31:58.834
(Horn honks)

32:00.377 --> 32:04.673
I'm sorry.
I seem to have broken your bike.

32:04.798 --> 32:07.384
(Sobbing)

32:09.261 --> 32:10.429
Where'd he go?

32:12.973 --> 32:14.892
Put up your dukes, put up your dukes!

32:15.017 --> 32:17.686
(Crowd laughing, shouting)

32:23.150 --> 32:25.235
- (Laughing)
- (Speaking alien language)

32:25.361 --> 32:28.697
What are you going to do,
knock my block off?

32:29.114 --> 32:30.950
(Screams)

32:31.075 --> 32:32.451
Damn!

32:34.036 --> 32:35.913
(Woman)
Hey, come on, let's get out of here!

32:36.038 --> 32:37.081
(Man) Come on, guys!

32:37.206 --> 32:38.207
(Woman 2) Get me out of here!

32:38.332 --> 32:40.292
(Distorted laughter)

32:43.545 --> 32:45.673
(Growling)

32:47.883 --> 32:50.427
Here's some more ketchup
for your French fries.

32:50.552 --> 32:51.845
Now, here's some more ketchup.

32:51.971 --> 32:54.431
I want you to sit still
and eat your hamburger.

32:54.556 --> 32:56.767
You know,
this isn't as much fun as it used to be.

32:56.892 --> 32:58.769
(Laughs) It is if you're the winners.

34:00.205 --> 34:01.498
Back here, young lady.

34:01.623 --> 34:03.751
You're not going anywhere
until you finish your food.

34:04.960 --> 34:08.422
(Growling)

34:24.772 --> 34:26.440
What's going on?

36:10.127 --> 36:11.628
All right, get out.

36:15.215 --> 36:16.717
Turn around.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.594
What are you doing, man?

36:18.719 --> 36:19.761
You're not going to hit me, are you?

36:19.887 --> 36:21.763
Just turn around, pal, all right?

36:21.889 --> 36:23.182
Look, I'm sorry about Debbie, but I...

36:23.307 --> 36:24.725
Just drop it, Mike!

36:29.646 --> 36:31.106
Check this out.

36:32.065 --> 36:33.358
That's the stuff.

36:33.483 --> 36:34.693
That's the stuff
that I was telling you about

36:34.818 --> 36:36.653
that was all wrapped
around Joe Lombardo.

36:36.778 --> 36:37.738
Where'd you get that?

36:37.863 --> 36:39.489
Over in that Jeep over there.

36:40.365 --> 36:42.159
- That's McReed's Jeep.
- Who's McReed?

36:42.284 --> 36:44.661
Bob McReed. He was up here tonight
with me and Debbie.

36:45.329 --> 36:49.249
Those are his glasses.
They got him. He's dead.

36:52.711 --> 36:55.088
(Chuckling)

37:01.386 --> 37:03.263
(Phone rings)

37:04.014 --> 37:05.766
Crescent Cove police station.
Mooney speaking.

37:05.891 --> 37:07.517
(Woman)
'I'd like to report a disturbance.'

37:07.643 --> 37:09.853
Wait a minute. Calm down.
I can't understand you.

37:09.978 --> 37:11.521
- 'Clowns!'
- What?

37:11.647 --> 37:13.982
'They're at my front door!
They're destroying property!'

37:14.107 --> 37:15.525
Clowns, huh?

37:16.360 --> 37:18.237
And now they're at your front door, huh?

37:18.362 --> 37:19.863
'They're at my front door right now!'

37:19.988 --> 37:21.073
Wait a minute. Who is this?

37:21.198 --> 37:23.450
'Would you just get over here?'

37:24.660 --> 37:27.496
Stupid kids and their pranks.

37:28.705 --> 37:30.290
(Sighs)

37:31.541 --> 37:33.043
Rich little bastards.

37:34.127 --> 37:35.837
I'd shoot them all.

37:37.756 --> 37:40.342
Daddy sends them
to fancy schools...

37:41.468 --> 37:44.513
...so the police department
can babysit the little pricks.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.687
(Phone ringing)

37:53.939 --> 37:56.066
Police station.
Mooney speaking. Yeah.

37:57.234 --> 37:58.819
(Stammers) Hello, Curt?

37:59.486 --> 38:02.489
I think I have a bit of a problem here.

38:06.952 --> 38:09.705
- (Phone rings)
- Oh... Just a minute.

38:09.830 --> 38:11.748
Jesus, not you, too, Mr. Myers.

38:14.126 --> 38:16.503
Police station. Mooney here.
What?

38:16.628 --> 38:18.630
(Man) 'They took my wife... the clowns...'

38:18.755 --> 38:21.091
Oh. They took your wife away
in a balloon?

38:21.216 --> 38:24.011
Well, you don't need the police, pal.
You need a psychiatrist!

38:26.471 --> 38:28.307
- Mr. Myers?
- (♪ Music playing over phone)

38:28.432 --> 38:30.600
- (Screaming over phone)
- (Line hangs up)

38:30.726 --> 38:33.562
Do the Terenzi brothers
have the whole town in on this?

38:36.315 --> 38:38.400
Well, to hell with them all.

38:42.612 --> 38:44.573
They wanna play games,

38:44.698 --> 38:46.825
they're messing with the wrong guy.

38:56.001 --> 38:58.545
- (Cackling)
- Huh?

38:58.670 --> 38:59.963
Jesus! Oh, no!

39:00.088 --> 39:02.507
Oh, no! Come on, Joe, get going!

39:09.056 --> 39:11.099
- God!
- (Roaring)

39:11.224 --> 39:13.560
(Tires squealing)

39:19.858 --> 39:21.318
(Both grunt)

39:21.443 --> 39:23.070
(Screaming)

39:37.626 --> 39:40.587
(Distorted laughter)

40:11.284 --> 40:14.663
(Shower running)

40:14.788 --> 40:16.915
(Faint squeaking)

40:42.649 --> 40:45.652
(Squeaking)

41:30.322 --> 41:33.074
(Squeaking)

41:51.384 --> 41:53.303
(Screaming)

41:58.016 --> 42:00.977
I'll call the state police
up at Marlborough. They've got a lab.

42:01.102 --> 42:03.563
Maybe somebody up there
can tell us what this stuff is.

42:03.688 --> 42:05.482
It's not cotton candy, that's for sure.

42:05.982 --> 42:08.902
Yes. Finally.
That's what I've been telling you.

42:10.946 --> 42:14.157
Look, I'm sorry
I was a little tough on you back there.

42:14.991 --> 42:16.576
It's been a hard night.

42:18.286 --> 42:21.039
Having Debbie involved
just makes it a lot more difficult.

42:21.164 --> 42:22.541
What can I say? I didn't know...

42:22.666 --> 42:25.544
It's got nothing to do with you, really.
It's me.

42:26.378 --> 42:28.588
It's obvious she goes for laughs,
not stability.

42:41.184 --> 42:42.811
(Clown chuckles)

42:55.448 --> 42:58.451
- (All) Oh!
- (Laughing)

43:00.328 --> 43:01.371
- Boo.
- Oh...

43:01.496 --> 43:04.791
- Oh, my God.
- (Laughing)

43:07.377 --> 43:09.713
(Chuckling)

43:16.886 --> 43:18.597
(Elephant trumpets)

43:22.642 --> 43:24.394
(Chuckles)

43:27.314 --> 43:29.733
(Exclaiming)

43:31.067 --> 43:33.820
(♪ Circus music plays)

43:35.655 --> 43:38.617
(Mike) You can just drop me off
over here. I'll take the bus home.

43:38.742 --> 43:42.078
(Dave) No way. Remember,
you're the one who's seen these things.

43:43.246 --> 43:44.789
Look! A clown! Right there!

43:49.252 --> 43:51.504
(Mike) There he is. I told you.
Will you get out there and shoot him?

43:51.630 --> 43:53.882
- Get him, Dave. Kill him.
- Hang on, Mike.

43:54.007 --> 43:55.634
Calm down. Let me check this out.

44:02.140 --> 44:03.266
(Laughing)

44:05.268 --> 44:06.770
(All gasping)

44:12.067 --> 44:14.361
- Holy shit!
- I don't believe it.

44:21.618 --> 44:24.037
- Dave, run it down!
- Mike, let go! Mike! Mike!

44:26.915 --> 44:28.500
(Cackling)

44:30.210 --> 44:32.545
What are you doing?
You could've gotten us killed!

44:32.671 --> 44:35.590
I'm sorry.
I freaked out a little bit.

44:35.715 --> 44:37.092
Where is he?

44:37.217 --> 44:39.260
(Panting)

44:45.850 --> 44:48.812
I don't know.
I don't see him anywhere.

44:51.773 --> 44:53.149
He's gone.

44:53.608 --> 44:55.485
He went straight up.

44:56.319 --> 44:57.404
I've seen enough.

44:58.863 --> 45:01.074
One Baker five.
Curt, do you read me? Over.

45:01.866 --> 45:05.161
One Baker five.
This is Mooney speaking.

45:05.286 --> 45:07.163
I was a little worried about you.

45:07.288 --> 45:10.625
I thought the big bad clowns
got a hold of you. Over.

45:10.750 --> 45:13.253
Mooney, I want you to listen to me
and don't say anything.

45:13.378 --> 45:15.004
I want you to call the state police
and get help.

45:15.130 --> 45:18.800
There are clowns,
and they are killing people. Over.

45:18.925 --> 45:20.552
OK, let me get this straight.

45:20.677 --> 45:23.680
You say there are clowns,
and you've seen them.

45:23.805 --> 45:25.557
OK, Dave, that's it.

45:25.682 --> 45:28.059
Screw you and your college flunkies.

45:28.184 --> 45:30.353
I've had enough of this from you
and from everyone else.

45:30.478 --> 45:32.564
I know what you guys are trying to do:

45:32.689 --> 45:34.899
break me down,
drive me out of the force.

45:35.024 --> 45:37.736
Well, it's going to take a hell of a lot more
than a lame prank like this

45:37.861 --> 45:43.074
to get Curtis Mooney to throw in
his badge, so fuck you! Over.

45:43.199 --> 45:46.035
Mooney, this is an emergency.
Mooney!

45:46.870 --> 45:50.331
He cut me off.
That son of a bitch cut me off!

45:50.457 --> 45:52.542
I got to get...
I got to get back to the station.

45:52.667 --> 45:55.670
I don't know what I'm going to say,
but I got to get through to the state police.

45:55.795 --> 45:57.005
(Screaming in distance)

45:57.130 --> 45:59.424
(Rich) Paul, get the truck!
(Paul) What about the girls?

45:59.549 --> 46:01.468
(Rich) Forget about the girls.
They eat too much.

46:01.593 --> 46:02.886
(Paul) They didn't pay for the ice cream!

46:03.011 --> 46:04.596
(Rich) So what?
The truck's getting away!

46:04.721 --> 46:06.681
Hey, those aren't killer clowns.
Those are the Terenzi brothers.

46:06.806 --> 46:08.057
Terenzi brothers?

46:08.183 --> 46:09.601
Get back to the station. Radio for help.

46:09.726 --> 46:11.478
I'll catch up with my friends,
try to warn people.

46:11.603 --> 46:13.730
Tell everyone to stay indoors
and don't do anything stupid.

46:13.855 --> 46:14.939
You, too.

46:22.197 --> 46:23.615
- Oh, shit.
- (Paul) You idiot!

46:23.740 --> 46:24.908
(Rich) Don't yell at me!
You were driving!

46:25.033 --> 46:26.576
Can't you just do one thing right?

46:26.701 --> 46:28.953
This whole ice cream thing
was your idea.

46:29.078 --> 46:31.080
My idea?
You said we'd get girls this way.

46:31.206 --> 46:32.332
No, I didn't. You did.

46:32.457 --> 46:34.459
- You did.
- You did.

46:34.584 --> 46:35.877
You did.

46:37.003 --> 46:38.755
(Mike) Hey, Rich, Paul!

46:38.880 --> 46:40.924
Oh, man, am I glad to see you guys.

46:41.049 --> 46:42.592
Mike, how you doing?
You want some ice cream?

46:42.717 --> 46:43.802
No, no, man, listen.

46:43.927 --> 46:45.595
Something horrible has happened.
I need your help.

46:45.720 --> 46:47.096
- What are you talking about?
- What's wrong?

46:47.222 --> 46:48.681
There's no time to explain.

46:48.807 --> 46:50.642
There's clowns going around
killing people.

46:51.768 --> 46:52.894
(Both) Ha!

46:53.019 --> 46:55.772
Tonight, Debbie and I
were up on the Top of the World,

46:55.897 --> 46:58.191
and we followed this spaceship,
and there were these...

46:58.316 --> 47:00.902
there were these clowns
carrying cotton candy cocoons

47:01.027 --> 47:04.239
and they were shooting
these... these popcorn guns.

47:04.364 --> 47:06.491
And there's...
there's a circus tent spaceship, right?

47:06.616 --> 47:08.284
But it's not there anymore,
but we were there.

47:08.409 --> 47:09.536
We saw the whole thing.

47:09.661 --> 47:12.664
And they say we're crazy. So?

47:12.789 --> 47:14.666
Oh, come on, you guys.
I'm not fooling around.

47:14.791 --> 47:17.961
Mike, what do you want us to do?
We have ice cream to sell tonight.

47:18.086 --> 47:19.671
Paul, this is more important
than selling ice cream.

47:19.796 --> 47:22.173
There's clowns going around
killing people. We're all in danger.

47:22.674 --> 47:24.759
Well, we haven't sold
that much ice cream tonight.

47:24.884 --> 47:25.927
We haven't sold any.

47:26.052 --> 47:27.762
Come on, guys, will you help me?

47:27.887 --> 47:29.597
At least take me over
to Debbie's house, OK?

47:29.722 --> 47:30.807
I think she's in danger.

47:31.850 --> 47:33.059
Does she have any roommates?

47:34.394 --> 47:37.146
Yes. She's got two.
She's got two beautiful roommates

47:37.272 --> 47:38.898
with big boobs.

47:39.023 --> 47:40.233
Do they like ice cream?

47:40.358 --> 47:41.526
They love it.

47:42.485 --> 47:45.363
(Both) What are we waiting for?
(Laughing)

47:45.488 --> 47:47.031
(Mike) Come on!

47:48.116 --> 47:50.201
You guys, get out of the way.

47:51.369 --> 47:53.788
(Phones ringing)

47:55.415 --> 47:57.166
Frig youse all.

47:58.084 --> 47:59.961
You ain't going to get the best of me.

48:00.086 --> 48:02.213
(Phones continue ringing)

48:06.259 --> 48:09.387
I made it through Korea.
I can make it through this bullshit.

48:17.437 --> 48:19.397
(Door opens)

48:26.237 --> 48:27.488
(Laughing) Well...

48:27.947 --> 48:30.408
Whoop dee goddamn dee do.

48:30.533 --> 48:32.243
What do we have here?

48:42.045 --> 48:45.673
Well, son,
I think you made a big mistake.

48:45.798 --> 48:48.009
You're in Mooney's territory now.

48:50.595 --> 48:52.138
For me?

48:59.562 --> 49:00.563
(Gasping)

49:01.981 --> 49:03.816
I ought to shoot you right now,

49:03.942 --> 49:06.069
you red-nosed freak.

49:06.611 --> 49:09.113
So you want to play games, eh?

49:19.832 --> 49:21.376
Turn around!

49:26.839 --> 49:28.174
All right.

49:29.342 --> 49:31.636
I'm supposed to read you your rights,

49:31.761 --> 49:33.888
but you're in Mooney's jail...

49:35.014 --> 49:37.392
...and you ain't got no rights.

49:37.517 --> 49:39.394
All right, buster.

49:40.144 --> 49:41.479
God.

49:49.821 --> 49:51.614
Officer Mooney,
come on, let us out of here.

49:51.739 --> 49:53.157
Are we going to be here all night?

49:53.282 --> 49:54.450
We get one phone call, don't we?

49:54.575 --> 49:56.828
- Right. I'm going to call my...
- Shut up!

50:08.214 --> 50:09.799
Get your hands up.

50:15.888 --> 50:17.515
(Chuckles)

50:32.530 --> 50:34.157
Get in there.

50:41.539 --> 50:42.665
(Grunts)

50:43.750 --> 50:44.751
(Growling)

50:52.842 --> 50:55.094
I don't know who you are,

50:55.219 --> 50:57.555
but before this night's over,

50:58.306 --> 51:00.266
you're going to be begging for mercy.

51:02.852 --> 51:05.063
(Growling)

51:05.188 --> 51:07.315
(Bars clang)

51:17.742 --> 51:19.410
What are you in for?

51:32.090 --> 51:34.926
(Squeaking)

51:35.051 --> 51:37.095
(Siren wailing)

51:44.977 --> 51:47.105
- Mooney!
- (Phone ringing)

51:50.733 --> 51:53.653
- Police department. Hello?
- (Indistinct noises on phone)

52:46.414 --> 52:47.623
Mooney?

52:48.499 --> 52:50.459
Mooney, you back here?

53:41.552 --> 53:43.012
Oh, God.

54:29.725 --> 54:31.102
Hey, Dave,

54:31.811 --> 54:34.689
who was the lady I saw you with
last night?

54:45.658 --> 54:47.285
Don't worry, Dave.

54:49.120 --> 54:51.580
All we want to do is kill you.

55:06.679 --> 55:08.806
(Growling)

55:26.741 --> 55:29.952
- (Gunshot)
- (Roaring)

55:31.537 --> 55:33.497
(Moaning)

55:44.383 --> 55:46.510
(Man over radio) 'C.C.P.D.,
this is Marlborough State Police.'

55:46.635 --> 55:48.971
'Dave, Curt, are you there? Over.'

55:49.096 --> 55:50.348
Jack, Jack, we need your assistance.

55:50.473 --> 55:52.808
The town's gone crazy.
People are being killed. Over.

55:52.933 --> 55:55.770
'What's all these reports
about circus clowns?'

55:56.437 --> 55:58.898
These clowns aren't people.
They're some kind of creatures,

55:59.023 --> 56:00.649
things from another planet.

56:00.775 --> 56:04.028
Jack, they're killing people.
Officer Mooney is dead.

56:04.153 --> 56:06.697
I know. I saw it.
He was killed by one of these things.

56:06.822 --> 56:09.742
Could you send all available units
immediately, please? Over.

56:09.867 --> 56:11.035
(Static)

56:11.160 --> 56:12.620
Come on, Jack!

56:12.745 --> 56:14.622
(Static)

56:16.165 --> 56:19.418
'OK, calm down, buddy.
Help is on the way.'

56:25.341 --> 56:27.218
(Sighs)

56:31.305 --> 56:32.807
(Whispers) Debbie.

56:39.563 --> 56:42.066
(Paul over loudspeaker)
'Calling all clowns, calling all clowns.

56:42.191 --> 56:43.526
'This is Jojo.

56:43.651 --> 56:46.570
'Are there any space clowns out there?'
(Laughs)

56:46.695 --> 56:49.573
(Mike)
You guys, will you stop fooling around?

56:49.698 --> 56:51.659
Look, Mike, come on.

56:51.784 --> 56:54.787
Cocoons,
popcorn guns, monster shadows.

56:54.912 --> 56:57.915
- I mean, what do you think we are?
- We're not as stupid as we look.

56:58.040 --> 57:00.751
This isn't the first wild thing
you've tried to put over on us.

57:00.876 --> 57:02.294
Look, you remember Hidden Lake?

57:02.420 --> 57:05.131
Come on, forget Hidden Lake.
This has nothing to do with Hidden Lake.

57:05.256 --> 57:09.176
We would have to be total morons
to believe this clown invasion crap.

57:09.301 --> 57:11.804
If there are killer clowns
running around here,

57:11.929 --> 57:14.098
then I'm Porky Pig.

58:07.234 --> 58:09.028
Get the hell out of here.

58:27.630 --> 58:28.881
(Laughter)

58:34.261 --> 58:35.387
(Snarling)

58:35.513 --> 58:36.847
Ah!

58:40.267 --> 58:42.144
(Screaming)

58:55.491 --> 58:56.909
Ah!

59:03.832 --> 59:04.750
(Screams)

59:24.770 --> 59:26.605
(Yelps)

59:27.648 --> 59:30.317
(Knocking on door)
Debbie, it's Mike. Open up.

59:30.442 --> 59:31.819
Mike?

59:33.237 --> 59:36.282
- (Screaming)
- (Mike's voice) Debbie, Debbie, Debbie.

59:37.950 --> 59:39.410
- (Drilling)
- (Screaming)

59:43.872 --> 59:45.624
(Screaming)

59:48.252 --> 59:50.129
(Whimpering)

59:51.130 --> 59:54.592
- (Screaming)
- (Cackling)

59:54.717 --> 59:56.885
(Moaning, screaming)

59:57.011 --> 59:58.554
(Distorted laughter)

01:00:13.152 --> 01:00:14.278
(Laughing)

01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:21.243
(♪ "Pop Goes The Weasel" playing)

01:00:22.661 --> 01:00:24.330
(Mike) OK, see this white house
right over here?

01:00:24.455 --> 01:00:26.332
- Take a right... I mean a left right here.
- (Paul) A left?

01:00:26.457 --> 01:00:27.333
- (Mike) Right.
- (Paul) Right.

01:00:27.458 --> 01:00:28.709
No, left! Left!

01:00:37.092 --> 01:00:38.677
(Mike) The house right up...

01:00:40.929 --> 01:00:43.057
Holy shit. What is that?

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:47.019
Uh-oh.

01:00:50.522 --> 01:00:52.274
Wow. Look at that.

01:00:52.399 --> 01:00:54.943
Mike! (Moaning)

01:00:59.239 --> 01:01:01.659
Come on, we can't lose them!
They got Debbie!

01:01:16.006 --> 01:01:17.007
Hey, Mike!

01:01:22.221 --> 01:01:25.140
(Siren wailing)

01:01:26.684 --> 01:01:29.061
Come on, Rich, we're losing them.
Can you go a little bit faster?

01:01:29.186 --> 01:01:31.313
Mike, what do you want?
This is an ice cream truck.

01:01:45.285 --> 01:01:47.579
Hey, Rich, the cops!
Stop the truck!

01:01:47.705 --> 01:01:49.665
- (Tires screech)
- Ah!

01:01:50.916 --> 01:01:54.002
- (Grunts)
- Shit, Rich, now you did it.

01:01:54.128 --> 01:01:55.671
I did it? What do you mean?
You told me to stop.

01:01:55.796 --> 01:01:58.882
- I told you to pull over.
- You didn't. You said stop, so I stopped.

01:01:59.007 --> 01:02:00.050
I meant pull over.

01:02:00.175 --> 01:02:02.094
If you meant pull over,
you should have said pull over.

01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:03.887
(Paul) Why don't you say
what you mean next time?

01:02:04.012 --> 01:02:05.764
(Rich) Come on,
let's go see what happened.

01:02:09.143 --> 01:02:10.477
(Mike)
Dave, are you OK?

01:02:12.855 --> 01:02:14.148
Oh, God.

01:02:14.273 --> 01:02:17.109
Oh, fuck.
What the hell are you guys doing?

01:02:17.234 --> 01:02:18.318
They got Debbie.

01:02:19.611 --> 01:02:21.029
Get in the truck, pal.

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:27.536
Gee, officer, I'm really sorry.
I was feeling a little queasy.

01:02:27.661 --> 01:02:28.704
Which way were they heading?

01:02:28.829 --> 01:02:30.330
They went that way,
but now we lost them.

01:02:30.456 --> 01:02:31.707
I don't know where they went.

01:02:31.832 --> 01:02:34.460
(Dave) I do. If you were a clown,
where would you hide?

01:02:34.585 --> 01:02:35.669
(Mike) The amusement park!

01:02:35.794 --> 01:02:37.963
- (Rich) Great!
- (Paul) All right!

01:03:09.578 --> 01:03:10.788
(Grunts)

01:03:10.913 --> 01:03:14.875
The park's closed.
I'll have to ask you to leave.

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:24.510
(Grunting)

01:03:46.573 --> 01:03:49.910
What are you going to do
with those pies, boys?

01:04:27.573 --> 01:04:29.658
(Squeaking)

01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:33.537
(♪ "Pop Goes The Weasel" playing)

01:04:39.251 --> 01:04:40.377
(Dave) Hey, hey, hey!

01:04:41.003 --> 01:04:42.212
Everybody stick together.

01:04:46.008 --> 01:04:47.175
She's gone.

01:04:47.301 --> 01:04:50.721
Wow. Hey, you guys, this is weird.

01:04:52.514 --> 01:04:53.932
Look at this stuff.

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:56.435
Looks like a wad of melted ice cream.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:57.603
(Dave) Yeah, well, it's not.

01:04:57.728 --> 01:04:58.770
(Mike) Oh, shit.

01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:00.981
Yeah.

01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:02.691
Come on.

01:05:17.664 --> 01:05:20.459
Mike, you take this and follow me.

01:05:20.584 --> 01:05:22.294
All right, now, you guys,

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:25.297
no fooling around.
Stick together, OK?

01:05:25.797 --> 01:05:27.758
What the hell's in here?

01:05:36.516 --> 01:05:39.436
Oh, scary!

01:05:39.561 --> 01:05:41.688
(Mike)
Dave, did you get through for help?

01:05:41.813 --> 01:05:44.149
Yeah. Yeah, help is on the way.

01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:46.443
You tell them it was an invasion?

01:05:46.568 --> 01:05:49.321
I told them,
but I don't really believe it myself.

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:50.822
Where did they come from?

01:05:50.948 --> 01:05:53.617
Why are they here?
Why, why clowns?

01:05:53.742 --> 01:05:55.535
(Mike) They're not clowns.

01:05:55.661 --> 01:05:57.412
They're some kind of animal
from another world

01:05:57.537 --> 01:05:59.247
that just look like clowns.

01:06:00.624 --> 01:06:02.000
Shit, Dave.

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:04.211
Dave,
maybe they're the ancient astronauts

01:06:04.336 --> 01:06:06.505
that came to our planet centuries ago,

01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:09.758
and our idea of clowns
just comes from them.

01:06:09.883 --> 01:06:11.843
Well, how come they're not funny?

01:06:11.969 --> 01:06:13.679
Maybe they're from a dying planet.

01:06:13.804 --> 01:06:16.181
Maybe their sun pooped out
and they need a new place to live.

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:20.268
Maybe they're using us
for experiments to dissect and study.

01:06:20.394 --> 01:06:22.854
So that means they're intelligent.

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:25.023
(Dave)
So why don't they communicate with us?

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:27.985
I mean, talk to us instead of killing us?

01:06:28.110 --> 01:06:30.445
Maybe they're just cruising
through the galaxy

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:33.573
and stopped here for a bite to eat.

01:06:36.118 --> 01:06:40.622
Yeah. Look, everybody,
let's just hold off on the talking, OK?

01:06:40.747 --> 01:06:42.624
Let's not give ourselves away.

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:45.210
What are we gonna do
when we find them?

01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:49.006
- (Mike) Can we kill 'em?
- (Dave) Yeah. You shoot 'em in the nose.

01:06:58.515 --> 01:07:00.392
Hey, watch this.

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:01.893
(Tones playing)

01:07:02.019 --> 01:07:03.186
Cool.

01:07:28.045 --> 01:07:29.421
- (Loud horn blaring)
- Whoo!

01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:30.672
What happened?

01:07:30.797 --> 01:07:33.175
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.

01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:37.220
Look, don't touch anything, OK?
This place is probably booby-trapped.

01:07:42.601 --> 01:07:44.478
All right now,
look you guys, stay together.

01:07:44.603 --> 01:07:46.271
I don't want
to have to find you, too.

01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:48.565
No problem. We can handle it.

01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:50.150
Yeah.

01:07:57.657 --> 01:08:00.118
All right, let's go.

01:08:00.243 --> 01:08:03.663
Where'd they go?
Come on, Rich, Paul.

01:08:04.289 --> 01:08:07.751
Don't worry about the Terenzi brothers.
They do this all the time.

01:08:07.876 --> 01:08:11.213
Those guys are like cats.
They always land on their feet.

01:08:11.338 --> 01:08:14.257
(Groaning)

01:08:14.382 --> 01:08:15.884
(Laughing)

01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:18.511
- Oh! Ah!
- Uh!

01:08:31.899 --> 01:08:33.693
Are you Debbie's roommates?

01:08:34.528 --> 01:08:36.279
Wait a second.

01:08:38.073 --> 01:08:39.783
I recognize this place.

01:08:41.076 --> 01:08:44.453
This is the tent that Debbie and I were in.
Come on!

01:08:52.712 --> 01:08:53.964
Go, Mike.

01:09:06.725 --> 01:09:08.895
OK, this is where we were before.

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:11.106
Oh, this is incredible.

01:09:11.231 --> 01:09:13.149
Looks like they got the whole town.

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:16.944
We got to find her.
What color balloon was she in?

01:09:17.069 --> 01:09:19.197
Uh... Yellow.

01:09:19.322 --> 01:09:20.948
All right.

01:09:34.171 --> 01:09:35.546
Shh!

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.006
See anything, Mike?

01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:38.341
No.

01:09:43.513 --> 01:09:45.182
This is impossible, Mike.

01:09:52.772 --> 01:09:53.857
(Growl)

01:09:56.401 --> 01:09:57.485
Sh. Quiet.

01:09:57.611 --> 01:09:59.321
Move back.

01:10:02.073 --> 01:10:04.242
(Loud rumbling)

01:10:33.146 --> 01:10:35.023
(Growling)

01:10:55.961 --> 01:10:58.630
(Slurping)

01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:32.372
(Belches)

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:48.221
Paul was right, man. They are hungry.
They're gonna eat everybody, man!

01:11:48.346 --> 01:11:50.265
Just calm down.
Just calm down, all right?

01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:52.559

Hey. Hey, that's the one.
The yellow balloon.

01:11:57.647 --> 01:11:58.982
Is she in there?

01:11:59.107 --> 01:12:00.317

01:12:00.442 --> 01:12:01.651

01:12:01.776 --> 01:12:03.111
- She's alive.
- Thank God.

01:12:03.236 --> 01:12:05.697
- How do we get her out of here?
- I don't know.

01:12:06.239 --> 01:12:07.407
Careful, Mike.

01:12:07.532 --> 01:12:08.783
Damn it!

01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:10.452
Debbie. Honey.

01:12:10.577 --> 01:12:11.703
- Hang on a sec, Mike.
- Damn!

01:12:12.871 --> 01:12:14.664
- What are you doin'?
- Just stand back, Mike.

01:12:14.789 --> 01:12:15.832
You can't shoot. You could kill her.

01:12:15.957 --> 01:12:17.500
Well, just back off, all right?

01:12:17.625 --> 01:12:19.210
Now, just get ready to run.

01:12:22.589 --> 01:12:24.758
- Are you all right?

01:12:26.926 --> 01:12:30.472
- Are you OK?

01:12:30.597 --> 01:12:32.432
(Gasping) I couldn't breathe.

01:12:32.557 --> 01:12:35.268
It's OK. Hey, Mike,
hang on to her for a second.

01:12:35.393 --> 01:12:38.229
Oh, God.
We got to get the hell out of here.

01:12:38.355 --> 01:12:40.690
Come on, Debbie. Come on, come on.

01:12:40.815 --> 01:12:42.901
Oh, come on. Come on.

01:12:45.904 --> 01:12:47.489
Wait a second, guys. We can't leave.

01:12:48.156 --> 01:12:50.158
There might be other people still alive
in these balloons.

- What now?
- Everybody, down.

01:13:30.782 --> 01:13:32.742
- We don't know what's down here.
- Come on, Mike.

01:13:32.867 --> 01:13:35.286
Nobody's gonna put me
in a balloon again.

01:13:36.204 --> 01:13:37.747
