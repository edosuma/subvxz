WEBVTT

00:09.240 --> 00:11.280
Let me show you what your father did.

00:11.360 --> 00:13.080
He blew up the Skanda pub.

00:13.160 --> 00:14.880
Alaric Henderson's confession
is on my phone.

00:14.960 --> 00:17.960
He said they had to talk
you off a bridge.

00:18.040 --> 00:19.600
Why did she lie to me?

00:19.680 --> 00:21.520
She was trying to protect you.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.760
When you get out,
anything you want,

00:23.840 --> 00:25.240
call me and it's yours.

00:25.320 --> 00:26.640
You should see the footage I've got.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.200
The Black
Sea in June.

00:28.280 --> 00:31.600
Holiday of a lifetime, until
something went wrong.

00:31.680 --> 00:32.920
-We don't have to lose.
-How?

00:33.000 --> 00:35.520
Theoretically, the voting system
could be hacked.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.920
Tell me that's another deep-fake
recording.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.800
Is this a joke?

00:39.880 --> 00:43.200
Made for women by men,
like the rest of the world.

00:43.280 --> 00:45.400
What was your role in the Skanda
bombing?

00:45.480 --> 00:47.240
I vowed to protect the union.

00:47.320 --> 00:51.280
I think you've done it!
Transfer of power at midnight.

00:51.360 --> 00:56.400
Give an unhappy woman some hope
and she is yours.

00:56.480 --> 00:58.120
If what you did, you did for the
union,

00:58.200 --> 01:00.720
it's done now,
so you can be honest with me.

01:00.800 --> 01:02.880
We'll discuss this in the morning.

01:02.960 --> 01:07.000
Dad? Dad? Dad! Dad!

01:10.080 --> 01:14.800
London 06:00

01:24.640 --> 01:27.800
Our newly won independence offers
freedom

01:27.880 --> 01:32.320
but with that freedom there comes a
challenge.

01:32.400 --> 01:37.000
Are we brave enough to take on
the challenge of independence?

01:37.080 --> 01:39.480
Do we have the courage
to write a new chapter

01:39.560 --> 01:41.080
into the
history of this country.

01:41.160 --> 01:44.520
Let's for a second draw
on our past.

01:44.600 --> 01:49.840
Our contributions to science
alone have been immense.

01:49.920 --> 01:51.760
Can you imagine
a world without Penicillin,

01:51.840 --> 01:54.320
televisions,
phones?

01:54.400 --> 01:58.160
Once again our voice can be heard
on the global stage.

01:58.240 --> 02:02.560
A voice for justice,
fairness and compassion.

02:02.640 --> 02:06.760
And for those of you already
condemning these ideas as unrealistic

02:06.840 --> 02:08.640
I don't blame you.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.680
Yesterday, it was unrealistic.

02:11.760 --> 02:18.880
But today we can make our
long cherished dreams a reality.

02:20.520 --> 02:21.920
Are you ready to make history?

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Yes. Are you?

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
The Head of Operation will meet you
at the power station.

02:35.080 --> 02:36.960
His name is Mitchell McGuigan.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.560
I have to wear this?

02:39.440 --> 02:42.320
Our GRU friends will affect
an electrostatic discharge

02:42.400 --> 02:44.520
causing a microchip burnout.

02:44.600 --> 02:47.520
The repair call to Rieper Hansen
will divert to you.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.360
This is the machine
you need to get to.

02:53.480 --> 02:55.200
First opportunity,

02:55.280 --> 02:57.920
type in the security code you got
from Torben's laptop.

02:58.080 --> 03:01.200
We insert the USB, type in the code,

03:01.280 --> 03:03.440
three minutes to upload and get out.

03:03.520 --> 03:07.560
Redback, 1,000 to one shot.

03:07.640 --> 03:12.160
But here we are.
This close to victory.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
Hey! Dad! Dad!

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Hey!

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
♪ Piece me ♪

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000

04:39.040 --> 04:42.000

04:55.720 --> 04:57.520
Last night,
I spoke with the Heads of Security,

04:57.600 --> 04:59.560
Legal and Tech
and we are of one mind.

04:59.640 --> 05:01.960
The Scottish referendum was stolen.

05:02.040 --> 05:05.240
We must take every measure necessary
to reunite ourkingdom.

05:05.320 --> 05:09.400
Get your bots-blitzing social media
and all news agencies

05:09.480 --> 05:11.880
with stories
discrediting this result.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.920
Wait. That's not their job. We're not
Russia.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.520
We soon will be if we don't react!

05:17.600 --> 05:20.000
And tell the
Prime Minister I'll be there by nine. Go.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.920
Our job is to stop Redback.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
You think this isn't Redback? I'm
having trouble seeing a future for you here.

05:46.000 --> 05:46.920
Mr. Ogilvy.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.920
Thanks for this. Short notice.

05:49.000 --> 05:49.920
Take a seat.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.600
No, no. It won't take long.

05:51.680 --> 05:54.240
I've instructed the heads of
Technical Operations and Analysis

05:54.320 --> 05:57.160
to begin a full-scale investigation
into how a

05:57.240 --> 05:59.920
swing of the magnitude
you suffered last night was achieved.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.920
I'm sorry, you're... You're saying
the system actually was hacked?

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
The final count was consistent
with the exit polls.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.440
I need you to make a statement

06:08.520 --> 06:10.440
challenging
the validity of the vote,

06:10.520 --> 06:13.520
instigate a moratorium
while investigations are carried out.

06:13.600 --> 06:16.000
Unless
you think the country should be scythed in

06:16.080 --> 06:17.720
half on the basis of a couple of exit
polls.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
By challenging the result of the
vote, we'd be risking civil unrest.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.920
I warned you about Redback.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
You didn't listen.

06:26.080 --> 06:28.120
Yes, we think Russia
hacked the system

06:28.200 --> 06:31.680
to rig the vote and then release the
tape to explain the result.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.920
-All I'm asking is for two weeks--
-Where's the proof?

06:34.000 --> 06:36.560
What? Well, that's what we need the
investigation for.

06:36.640 --> 06:38.640
You believe the system was hacked.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.720
Come to me with proof,
I'll give you two weeks.

06:41.800 --> 06:42.920
I'll give
you as long as you need.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.160
So, someone in this building
has facilitated a coup d'état

06:46.240 --> 06:48.000
and you're OK with that, are you?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.920
How fucking dare you!

06:51.000 --> 06:53.640
Special Branch examined the tape.

06:53.720 --> 06:55.440
They said it was recorded by
a directional mic

06:55.520 --> 06:57.200
200, 300 yards from here.

06:57.280 --> 07:00.560
You knew what was at stake.

07:00.640 --> 07:04.160
Why didn't you
just say the tape was fake?

07:04.240 --> 07:06.080
Because it wouldn't have been the
truth.

07:06.160 --> 07:09.840
Oh, the truth! The fucking truth!

07:09.920 --> 07:12.600
There are things more important
than the truth.

07:12.680 --> 07:15.680
I couldn't disagree more.

07:15.760 --> 07:19.080
Your naivety disgusts me!

07:19.160 --> 07:21.040
This meeting's over.

07:21.120 --> 07:23.480
Prime Minister, I implore you, I beg
you,

07:23.560 --> 07:27.800
go to the cameras,
declare the result void. Please!

07:27.880 --> 07:30.360
I believe in democracy.

07:30.440 --> 07:34.160
I work for the British
people. And, unlike you,

07:34.240 --> 07:37.400
I was elected to carry
out their will.

07:39.280 --> 07:42.840
The result must stand.

07:53.520 --> 07:56.840
You two... you don't even know
what you've done.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.160
Still here? Good. Saves a phone call.

08:42.240 --> 08:45.760
As you said,
you did warn us about Redback.

08:45.840 --> 08:50.080
Set up a designated team
to counter the threat.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.440
Then you allowed a Russian mole
to operate in the heart

08:52.520 --> 08:56.480
of this designated team.

08:56.560 --> 09:00.400
I've commissioned a judicial enquiry
into you and your department.

09:02.200 --> 09:06.160
I thought you should know.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.520
IDs, please.

10:04.840 --> 10:05.920
Go ahead.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.680
Thank you, sir.

10:42.440 --> 10:46.680
What you do today,
changes Europe for ever.

10:49.680 --> 10:50.600
Katrine?

10:51.800 --> 10:53.480
I'm in pain.

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
There are a thousand ways to kill
pain. In one hour you can buy them all.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
It's mine.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.920
Thank you very much, sir. Thank you.
Good morning, sir. My name is--

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
I know who you are. You're late.

12:35.040 --> 12:40.920
Hello? Hello? Look, I need to use the
loo. Can you let me out? Can you let me out?

12:41.000 --> 12:43.280
What's with the banging?

12:45.840 --> 12:49.000
Miss Ogilvy needs
to use the facility.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.200
The system your company installed is
barely two weeks old.

13:21.280 --> 13:24.520
Our CEO has asked me to
pass on his apologies.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.800
Our diagnostics have
detected a ergostatic surge.

13:27.880 --> 13:28.920
It completely burnt out your CPU.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.920
How long is this all gonna take?

13:32.000 --> 13:34.520
It's gonna take 30 minutes. In and
out.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.920
Nila, Tyler, Benny, Kita.

13:46.000 --> 13:46.960
Hi.

13:47.040 --> 13:49.040
Glitch will be fixed very soon.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.200
Whoa, whoa.

14:44.920 --> 14:46.240
Hands.

14:50.040 --> 14:51.960
Move

14:56.000 --> 14:58.920
Gonna grab a donut. Anybody want
anything?

14:59.000 --> 15:00.480
Staying strong here.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.280
Benny Sørensen?

15:48.920 --> 15:49.920
Benny?

15:50.000 --> 15:51.600
Ah, that's nice.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
You are talking about
Benny from Skagen?

15:57.840 --> 15:59.680
No.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.560
-Preben?
-Gunst

16:06.680 --> 16:08.360
What are you doing here,
Preben Gunst?

16:08.440 --> 16:11.440
Mitchell said I should say hello.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.840
Where are you from?
Where are you from, Benny?

16:23.080 --> 16:26.080
Kopenhem

16:26.440 --> 16:30.240
"Kopenhem"? You don't sound
like you're from Copenhagen

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Where's Tyler?

16:42.000 --> 16:43.040
He heard a doughnut calling him.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.800
Nice to meet you.

17:13.880 --> 17:15.200
Stop!

18:09.040 --> 18:14.000
Are you done yet? Is that blood?

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Oh, it's mine.

18:22.000 --> 18:22.920
What happened?

18:23.000 --> 18:29.000
You see, they took out the stitches
too soon. I told them this would happen.

18:30.000 --> 18:35.920
Nila, could you show Kita the
bathroom? There's a first-aid kit in there.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Thanks.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
All right?

19:00.000 --> 19:00.920
Have you seen this?

19:01.000 --> 19:03.560
Adam's asked me
to polish his resignation speech.

19:03.640 --> 19:05.760
Do you think we should congratulate
Isla Robson?

19:05.840 --> 19:07.920
I think the less
we say about Scotland, the better.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.920
Scotland no longer exists.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
A message from Sir David.

19:13.080 --> 19:17.320
The 1922 Committee would
like you as caretaker PM.

19:17.400 --> 19:18.720
He says it's
unanimous

19:18.800 --> 19:22.200
and for some reason he's added '
a smiley emoji wearing a monocle.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.560
A symbol of royal ascent.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
I want Chief Adviser.

19:37.000 --> 19:37.920
Sorry?

19:38.000 --> 19:41.920
When you're installed as Prime
Minister, I'm your Chief Adviser.

19:42.000 --> 19:42.920
We've lined up a seat for you.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.960
Mm. In the Cotswolds. Fuck the
Cotswolds. I know what I'm worth.

19:46.040 --> 19:47.000
Nicky...

19:48.760 --> 19:51.280
You set me up.

19:51.360 --> 19:55.440
Digital voting?
Do you think I'm stupid?

19:55.520 --> 19:59.680
Do you think I was shocked when
the tape surfaced?

19:59.760 --> 20:04.120
Non-negotiable.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.640
Gavril.

20:26.240 --> 20:27.320
All is ready.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.960
Get comfortable.
Wait for the panic.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.920
Look at you. This is
a momentous day for us. Smile a bit.

20:41.000 --> 20:45.920
I will. I'll smile when William
Ogilvy, he is dead.

20:47.400 --> 20:48.920
You don't need to do that now, you
know?

20:49.000 --> 20:51.920
Oh, I do. With what I know,

20:52.000 --> 20:54.280
I mean, he's not going to let me
live.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
I've got a slight itch here.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
You might have to give it a scratch.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.920
You see that? When I increase the
feedwater.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.040
Mm, the temperature went up. Do it
again.

21:21.040 --> 21:25.040
Oh, that shouldn't happen. Um...

21:27.000 --> 21:29.920
Show me.

21:30.000 --> 21:30.040
It's already--
Show me. OK. Give it two minutes. See
if it settles down.

21:42.000 --> 21:47.040
Oh, hi. You haven't seen my phone,
have you? I put it down in the kitchen.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.920
You've been helping Adam with his
resignation speech.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.920
Yeah. A line here and there.

21:54.000 --> 21:59.000
Maybe I could help you with your
acceptance address.

21:59.080 --> 22:02.000
I'm sure you'd wanna thank us for
rescuing you.

22:04.000 --> 22:04.960
Of course.

22:05.040 --> 22:10.760
You were ready to quit. The next Tory
leader in the gutter.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.760
What happened to you?

22:12.840 --> 22:14.840
You know what happened.

22:14.920 --> 22:17.320
I watched the Foreign Secretary leave
for that flight.

22:17.400 --> 22:20.360
A trip to the Black Sea.
God knows

22:20.440 --> 22:23.040
who came back.

22:23.120 --> 22:24.280
I had a breakdown.

22:24.360 --> 22:26.400
Why are you going on..

22:29.520 --> 22:33.840
Etta here
doesn't think I'm up to the top job.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.360
Either your friend is the king of
abysmal advice

22:37.440 --> 22:39.000
or he's been shafting you.

22:41.640 --> 22:43.920
The referendum was my idea, Etta.

22:44.000 --> 22:49.240
Yeah, and what I remember is this guy
bullying you to stick to it.

22:49.320 --> 22:50.320
Bullying?

22:50.400 --> 22:51.440
And then there was that

22:51.520 --> 22:53.840
fake-the-results chat with your
little accomplice.

22:53.920 --> 22:55.920
She only had that
conversation because you told her to.

22:56.000 --> 22:56.920
Absolutely not.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.400
And worst of all,

22:59.480 --> 23:04.080
you advise Adam to conceal Holly's
DNA results until after the vote.

23:04.160 --> 23:05.920
-I'm not going to.
-Zac, hold on.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.600
Which also somehow manages to get
leaked,

23:08.680 --> 23:12.000
which almost leads to Holly killing
herself, you little shit!

23:13.040 --> 23:15.000
What?

23:16.040 --> 23:19.000
The police found her on Westminster
Bridge.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Why didn't you tell me?

23:26.000 --> 23:31.000
She didn't want you to know. She said
she wasn't going to do it.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.880
Well, I'll give her a call.

23:35.960 --> 23:40.360
I wouldn't. She doesn't want you
anywhere near her.

23:40.440 --> 23:43.080
Hard to believe, isn't it?

23:44.840 --> 23:47.120
When you're so
fucking wonderful.

23:58.040 --> 24:01.920
Hello? Holly. Where are you?

24:02.000 --> 24:05.960
I'm heading back to Scotland. Marcus,
I've done something stupid.

24:06.040 --> 24:07.960
What have you... What have you done?

24:08.040 --> 24:10.920
Remember you told me you were
investigating Zac Clark?

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Yeah.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.920
Well, I kinda borrowed his phone.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
-Tell me you're joking.
<i>-It's OK.</i>

24:22.360 --> 24:23.960
I... threw it in the Thames.

24:29.160 --> 24:32.800
Marcus, they completely used me.
Fuck them.

24:38.040 --> 24:43.920
Yes, we are aware. Yes. OK, will do.
Thank you. Bye.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.960
350. You said if it got above...

24:46.040 --> 24:46.960
I know what I said.

24:47.040 --> 24:53.920
That was the Head of Monitoring at
Rosatom. Apparently, we've got a problem. 350?

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
And rising.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
These must be wrong.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.040
We need to raise the control rods.
Shut down the reactor.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.400
OK, if it gets above 400...

25:10.520 --> 25:13.040
What the hell?

25:13.120 --> 25:16.840
Get that switched off.
Now!

25:29.000 --> 25:30.040
It's almost three o'clock.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.040
I canceled the speech.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
You're challenging the result?

25:41.000 --> 25:42.960
-No.
-Then why are you--

25:43.040 --> 25:50.920
I swore an oath of office. If they
want to get rid of me, they'll have to stage a contest.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.040
That'll take months.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.680
It'll take enough time for me to
persuade the membership

25:57.760 --> 25:59.920
that Zac isn't the right person
to lead the country.

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
Me not trusting Zac isn't the same as
wanting you to stay on.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.920
The country's at a crossroads.

26:09.000 --> 26:14.040
Oh, for God's sake! Spare me the
speech. Why are you so incapable of change?

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
People don't change, Etta.

26:24.000 --> 26:30.000
That's not true. I used to love you.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.920
The control rods are not responding.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.920
Try it again. Use the backup
generator!

26:52.000 --> 26:53.920
Nothing, nothing is working!

26:54.000 --> 26:57.920
Units 5 and 6 overheating.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
Shit. I
need to speak to the Minister for Energy. So, get him out of the meeting!

27:13.040 --> 27:15.000
Your father's back.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
How could you do that? What were you
thinking?

27:23.040 --> 27:30.920
If you do not have a belief that you
would die for, you do not deserve to live.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.920
What's happened?

27:33.000 --> 27:38.920
The Prime Minister... Fuck! I thought
we'd hit the bottom with Johnson.

27:39.000 --> 27:44.960
Look, why did you lock me up in here?
Huh? I'm asking you a question.

27:45.040 --> 27:47.040
I needed some time to think.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
So, now I can leave, can I?

28:03.000 --> 28:04.600
Miss Robson,
your Head of Operations confirmed

28:04.680 --> 28:07.400
that if the temperature on the
reactor continues to rise,

28:07.480 --> 28:08.880
you're six hours from
meltdown.

28:08.960 --> 28:11.680
I'm at the conference
in Scotland right now.

28:11.760 --> 28:16.520
Our state atomic energy board har
authorized any assitance you require.

28:16.600 --> 28:19.520
We have mobilized a team of science
advisors

28:19.600 --> 28:21.360
trained for this precise eventuality.

28:21.440 --> 28:23.520
I need your permission--

28:23.600 --> 28:26.000
How can you know what the problem is?

28:27.000 --> 28:31.920
We had an identical situation with
the same Rieper Hansen reactor in Sorgut.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
The EDF have offered help.

28:35.000 --> 28:43.000
The EDF... Do I have permission to...

28:55.000 --> 28:56.040
What did the Prime Minister say?

29:00.360 --> 29:02.960
He refused to challenge
the vote.

29:03.040 --> 29:08.000
He didn't want to allow time for an
investigation.

29:08.080 --> 29:11.920
Last night you didn't answer my
question. The bomb.

29:12.000 --> 29:12.920
Did I not?

29:13.000 --> 29:16.960
No, you obfuscated. You danced round
it. You didn't answer me, did you?

29:17.840 --> 29:20.520
Oh, well, yes, I gave the order.

29:20.600 --> 29:24.320
Well, I insinuated it...
I didn't think 11...

29:24.400 --> 29:31.000
God, no! But, yeah...
Down to me.

29:31.080 --> 29:33.800
And the attempts at assassination on
the Prime Minister?

29:36.360 --> 29:37.720
How did they hack Etta
Cornwell's diary?

29:37.800 --> 29:40.640
How did they get access to
those encrypted CPU calls?

29:42.360 --> 29:43.960
Dad?

29:44.040 --> 29:46.960
Well, that was an operation that was
always going to be a balls-up, wasn't it?

29:47.040 --> 29:50.440
I just thought
it would give, urm, Cornwell a boost.

29:53.600 --> 29:57.320
Do you know the Cold War
was won in this room?

29:57.400 --> 30:01.880
Strategies devised at this table...

30:01.960 --> 30:04.680
brought down the Soviet Union.

30:07.080 --> 30:10.040
And then the politicians came along
and allowed Russia

30:10.120 --> 30:13.640
to crawl out of the corpse.
Russia!

30:16.280 --> 30:19.760
Whose only intention is
to forge a new reality

30:19.840 --> 30:21.800
in which everyone loses.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.920
You have to make a statement to the
police and tell them what you just told me.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.480
Yes, of course.

30:33.640 --> 30:35.720
-Where are you going?
-I just need ten minutes.

30:35.800 --> 30:36.760
Why?

30:40.680 --> 30:42.680
I'm not gonna top myself if that's
what you're thinking.

30:42.760 --> 30:46.000
I need to phone the DG. Let him
know that you want a prosecution.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.840
Well, it's down to the CPS.

30:48.920 --> 30:50.960
No, no. This is what you want.

30:51.040 --> 30:54.280
It's
down to you.

30:54.360 --> 30:57.120
At least do me the honor of
acknowledging that.

31:00.000 --> 31:00.920
Make the call here.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
Ten fucking minutes, Beatrice, for
God's sake.

31:06.080 --> 31:09.760
News of a malfunction at the Gairloch
nuclear power station

31:09.840 --> 31:12.080
in Scotland is coming
in.

31:12.160 --> 31:16.200
Initial reports are saying the
reactors at the facility have lost the capability

31:16.280 --> 31:18.760
of pumping
cooling water into the core.

31:18.840 --> 31:22.000
If water levels
continue to drop,

31:22.080 --> 31:24.760
there is a real danger of a
nuclear meltdown.

31:24.840 --> 31:28.400
In an apparent snobb to the English
government

31:28.480 --> 31:30.080
First Minister, Isla
Robson,

31:30.160 --> 31:32.080
has accepted the offer of help

31:32.160 --> 31:33.920
from the Russian
State Atomic Energy Corporation.

31:34.000 --> 31:34.960
What's the holdup?

31:35.040 --> 31:38.920
Live from Inverness, we join Sabine
Mackenzie.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.920
This is the seventh...

31:41.000 --> 31:49.000
There's a bear in our back yard. Have
you spoken to anyone?

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
Not yet.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.560
Spetsnaz boots. Military issue.

31:59.640 --> 32:02.840
Isla Robson's invited the Russians
to invade our country.

32:02.920 --> 32:04.760
Redback's final metastasis.

32:23.040 --> 32:25.960
The Russians are pumping in seawater
to cool the rods.

32:26.040 --> 32:34.040
Mitchell McGuigan. You can go. Go.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.920
Look, this is Scotland's problem.

32:50.000 --> 32:54.800
No. Regnum Defende. The Defense of
the Realm as a whole.

32:54.880 --> 32:57.520
Look, you were about to go to the
police and make a statement.

32:57.600 --> 32:58.920
I'm not letting you
walk away from that.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.920
Our country has never needed us more.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
No!

33:03.400 --> 33:06.320
Right, listen, this Skanda business
goes to court,

33:06.400 --> 33:08.080
you spend the rest of your life
in prison.

33:09.000 --> 33:09.520
I will?

33:09.600 --> 33:11.880
You set up the attack.
Used a suicidal agent,

33:11.960 --> 33:14.720
he survives, you hang it on Laird, he
gets away, you track him down,

33:14.800 --> 33:16.600
shoot him, make it look
self-inflicted.

33:21.800 --> 33:24.080
Jelena warned me not to use
Kelvin

33:24.160 --> 33:27.800
because she said it's too easy to
manipulate people when they love you.

33:27.880 --> 33:29.120
Isn't it?

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
We are paid by the Crown to counter
by any means necessary

33:34.080 --> 33:36.720
those who would overthrow
parliamentary democracy.

33:36.800 --> 33:38.920
The Realm was
under threat, we took appropriate action.

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
What you did, that was the threat.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.920
All right? People would be horrified
to know what you did in their name.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.520
The British public would stand up
and applaud.

33:47.600 --> 33:50.240
Would they? Well, let's take this now
to the police.

33:50.320 --> 33:51.920
All right? See what response you get!

33:52.000 --> 33:53.920
Well, obviously, I can't let you do
that now, can I?

33:54.000 --> 33:55.800
Because you know that you'll lose.

33:55.880 --> 33:57.920
Because we're at war!

33:58.120 --> 33:59.800
Oh, Dad.

33:59.920 --> 34:01.360
Listen.

34:02.520 --> 34:04.440
I need you with me.

34:06.920 --> 34:11.000
I want you with me.
You and me, Beatrice. We are a team.

34:15.720 --> 34:18.800
No, no.

34:18.880 --> 34:22.440
If you don't have a belief
you'd die for, you don't deserve to live.

34:22.520 --> 34:25.320
That's what you
said, isn't it?

34:26.760 --> 34:29.200
I would die for the truth.

34:34.040 --> 34:35.920
Made my decision for me.

34:36.000 --> 34:44.000
No, no. Dad. Dad! No, Dad! No. Dad.
Dad! No. Dad!

34:49.000 --> 34:53.360
Find Sergov.
Tell him to call me immediately.

35:18.840 --> 35:21.840
Gavriil, a favor you owe me.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.000
It's your address.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
Female. Thirty-seven.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.160
William...

35:36.240 --> 35:38.680
There are two guards. I don't want
them implicated.

35:39.640 --> 35:43.640
I never want to know any details.
Call me when it's done.

35:43.720 --> 35:45.160
You have that?

35:45.280 --> 35:47.000
Yeah, I got it.

36:13.000 --> 36:17.000
Let me out! Come on! Let me out of
here!

36:19.000 --> 36:23.000
Gavril, Beatrice wasn't
a part of the plan.

36:24.480 --> 36:27.160
I will do it,
but it is total shit.

36:27.240 --> 36:29.400
I will call you.

36:44.280 --> 36:48.400
William Ogilvy?
I'll help you get him.

37:24.000 --> 37:24.920
We need to talk.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
What about?

37:28.040 --> 37:34.000
Dead men who won't lie down. William
Ogilvy and Adam Cornwell.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.000
What is she doing here?

38:11.480 --> 38:13.560
We'll take care of her.

38:14.280 --> 38:16.040
Get a drink

38:16.400 --> 38:19.400
Wait for her father

38:20.000 --> 38:23.960
Why are you here? You've won anyway.
Won because you're insane.

38:24.040 --> 38:26.000
We're insane?

38:27.000 --> 38:29.920
You don't think causing a nuclear
meltdown is insane?

38:30.000 --> 38:35.040
I thought you were supposed to be
smart. We faked it.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Who sent you to kill me? Was it my
father?

38:44.000 --> 38:44.920
So, you are smart.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.920
Hey! I want them both.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.920
She pointed a gun at me.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.200
Yeah, well but she actually shot me.

38:58.280 --> 39:00.680
So, are we working for William now,
huh?

39:01.080 --> 39:02.760
How much is he paying you?

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
Katrine!

39:09.000 --> 39:13.080
Hey! If I wanted you dead, you would
have been dead.

39:13.160 --> 39:14.920
Drop the blade. Look.

39:23.800 --> 39:26.040
That's supposed
to make me trust you?

39:26.120 --> 39:28.080
You got anything better?

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
Why did you kill him?

39:32.000 --> 39:32.920
He played me.

39:33.000 --> 39:33.960
Well...

39:34.040 --> 39:38.000
Yeah, imagine that. Trusting the
wrong man.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
Where are you gonna go?

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
I don't know.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Are you beaten?

39:57.000 --> 39:57.920
What?

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
Well, you've been betrayed and you've
been used.

40:03.000 --> 40:03.920
I've been betrayed?

40:04.000 --> 40:08.920
I'm asking you... Are you beaten?

40:09.000 --> 40:12.040
Of course I'm not beat. Ask him if
I'm beat.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
OK. I know what we do.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Something's gone wrong.

40:51.720 --> 40:54.920
I am honored. Scotland's first-ever
Prime Minister.

40:55.000 --> 40:55.040
General.

40:59.520 --> 41:01.960
Three-hundred men and women
have flown in to help you.

41:02.040 --> 41:03.240
They will need
accommodation.

41:03.320 --> 41:05.240
Three-hundred?

41:06.000 --> 41:09.320
Miss Robson, we have 26-billion
rubles in Scottish banks.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.920
England is intent on
destroying you.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.440
Our investment must be
protected.

41:14.520 --> 41:16.280
You need to close the border.

41:16.360 --> 41:18.800
No. Absolutely not.

41:19.040 --> 41:22.120
The sabotage of the nuclear plant

41:22.200 --> 41:25.480
was an act of war
carried out by your oldest enemy.

41:25.560 --> 41:28.920
If you don't close the border,
I will.

41:30.080 --> 41:34.000
But it will look
better coming from you.

41:55.000 --> 42:00.920
We were used. I didn't switch sides,
you did. I need to know why.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.920
Well, sometimes one lie makes you
realize that everything you said was a lie.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.920
What, and that's it?

42:07.000 --> 42:09.680
In ten minutes we walk into the bear
cage.

42:09.760 --> 42:13.520
If you're not 100 percent,
you're going to get me killed.

42:13.600 --> 42:15.920
That cuts both ways.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.920
You can't be thinking about what your
father did.

42:19.000 --> 42:23.040
Don't worry about me. I'm going there
to do a job and then I put him away.

42:36.720 --> 42:41.040
Madam Redback!

42:41.120 --> 42:43.520
If I were to give military medals

42:44.480 --> 42:47.480
you would want one.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Did you hear about the Ogilvy woman?

42:53.040 --> 42:54.920
She wants to come home?

42:55.000 --> 42:59.080
When your father orders your
execution, things change.

42:59.160 --> 43:03.000
But, of course, that's... That's
your decision.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
I think I need to hear it from her.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
OK.

43:21.000 --> 43:27.000
She's here. She's talking to General
Groschev. Switch to video.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Oh, my brilliant girl.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.880
-My friends, let's have a drink...
-To us.

44:05.960 --> 44:09.280
When powerful men set themselves
against truth,

44:09.360 --> 44:13.320
they must be stopped, no matter who
they are.

44:17.080 --> 44:20.080
