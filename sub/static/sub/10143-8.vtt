Last night, five EU officials
were kidnapped by this man,

00:04.914 --> 00:08.003
Fatmir Hasani, the biggest heroin
trafficker in the Balkans.

00:08.028 --> 00:10.521
Your mission is to secure
the release of the hostages.

00:11.319 --> 00:13.334
You ever feel like you're not
getting told the whole story?

00:13.551 --> 00:14.961
Not everything's a conspiracy.

00:15.406 --> 00:17.067
Howdy, folks.
I'm here to take you home.

00:19.076 --> 00:20.309
Get in the fucking jeep!

00:20.977 --> 00:22.970
We are clear
with the hostages.

00:23.225 --> 00:25.996
Jesus, Scott, the whole camp was
out looking for you.

00:26.021 --> 00:26.860
Where the fuck
were you?

00:26.885 --> 00:29.294
The US cavalry really exists!

00:29.319 --> 00:30.519
Come on.
Let's move.

00:30.526 --> 00:31.521
Put it down.

00:31.546 --> 00:32.746
Now.

00:33.288 --> 00:34.315
Piece of shit.

00:34.316 --> 00:35.516
Sorry, pal.

- Morning.

00:53.783 --> 00:55.417
You okay?

00:57.820 --> 01:00.756
- You remember where you are?
- I'm with you.

01:01.325 --> 01:02.491
Yeah.

01:08.892 --> 01:10.826
Stay here.

01:19.310 --> 01:21.511
Hey, wake up.

01:24.615 --> 01:26.591
This the bit where you
surprise me,

01:27.184 --> 01:28.384
tell me you know I'm MI6?

01:31.689 --> 01:33.556
We have orders
to execute you.

01:34.792 --> 01:40.463
If we want to.
I want to.

01:40.498 --> 01:42.166
What are you
doing in Kosovo?

01:42.200 --> 01:44.735
I was following a lead.
Last-minute tip-off.

01:44.770 --> 01:48.506
The rest is...don't take this
the wrong way but, you know,

01:48.541 --> 01:50.075
outside your skill-set.

01:50.109 --> 01:52.410
Rumor has it, you're
in Latif's rolodex.

01:52.445 --> 01:55.180
I've been offering him cooperation
in return for money.

01:56.482 --> 01:57.849
Now you're just giving me
a reason to kill you.

01:57.883 --> 01:59.551
Try to keep up.

01:59.585 --> 02:00.647
I've gained his trust, now

02:00.672 --> 02:02.352
I get to find out what he
wants to know from me.

02:02.355 --> 02:03.989
Then we'll know
what he's planning.

02:04.023 --> 02:05.724
You're telling me
you're a double agent?

02:05.758 --> 02:08.459
- Who's counting?
- I'll just kill you twice as hard.

02:08.494 --> 02:11.629
You're Damien Scott. Delta Force?
Dope in your locker?

02:11.663 --> 02:13.664
Dishonorable
Discharge...

02:13.699 --> 02:15.733
So you know who
set me up, huh?

02:15.767 --> 02:18.536
I bet you don't even
know what Trojan Horse is.

02:19.471 --> 02:22.640
Hey! Put him
down, Scott.

02:22.674 --> 02:25.210
- And now, you never will.
- Put him down!

02:25.244 --> 02:26.845
Fuck!

02:34.254 --> 02:37.023
Hasani wants to see you.

02:37.057 --> 02:38.558
Fuck you.

02:43.765 --> 02:46.198
I shoulda asked
myself what you were doing

02:46.233 --> 02:48.901
turning up at a dope
factory with an empty truck.

02:48.935 --> 02:51.407
It's like I said,
we're just here to keep the

02:51.432 --> 02:52.832
peace, not save the world.

02:52.870 --> 02:55.771
And if we can make a little money
on the side, then so be it.

02:55.806 --> 02:58.708
You're a fucking embarrassment
to our country in that uniform!

02:58.742 --> 03:03.511
Maybe, but tomorrow I'll still
be alive. And fucking rich.

03:03.545 --> 03:06.279
- I'll be seeing you, buddy.
- No you won't.

03:06.313 --> 03:08.846
Yeah, I will.

03:22.823 --> 03:24.764
- Kennedy.
- What?

03:25.141 --> 03:26.641
You need to
kill the old woman.

03:27.395 --> 03:28.622
Why?

03:28.647 --> 03:30.696
'Cause it's time you did
something for your cut.

03:30.697 --> 03:34.166
Take her out to the
pit and make it quick.

03:34.901 --> 03:36.401
Playtime's over!

03:44.907 --> 03:47.340
Ah, Jesus...

03:59.018 --> 04:02.720
Ma'am. You got
to come with me.

04:02.754 --> 04:05.222
Me? Where am I going?

04:05.256 --> 04:06.823
With me, Ma'am.

04:08.158 --> 04:12.895
Anyone hurts her, anyone
at all, I will kill you.

04:13.497 --> 04:14.864
Sure...

04:20.636 --> 04:24.105
It's all right, Michael.
Please don't worry.

04:26.074 --> 04:27.674
Thank you
for everything.

04:45.224 --> 04:46.791
Nice.

04:46.825 --> 04:48.793
I have a question for you.

04:48.827 --> 04:50.724
You bring my cousin here,

04:50.904 --> 04:53.643
and then you shoot him,
endangering your own mission.

04:53.965 --> 04:55.032
Why?

04:55.066 --> 04:56.867
There's a good question...

04:56.901 --> 04:59.802
You take the hostages and
then you break off your escape

04:59.827 --> 05:01.311
to attack my refinery?

05:01.371 --> 05:04.806
Oh, was that your place?
Sorry about that, huh?

05:06.308 --> 05:09.810
You will die today,
along with the others...

05:13.847 --> 05:17.816
Except the blonde
girl. She will live,

05:18.651 --> 05:20.285
unfortunately for her.

05:23.223 --> 05:24.256
Move...

05:24.291 --> 05:25.724
God be with you.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.265
You lay down for me?

05:33.067 --> 05:35.168
What's that noise?

05:42.911 --> 05:44.345
Oh dear God.

05:50.985 --> 05:53.587
Dana, I'm gonna
come get ya.

06:03.031 --> 06:04.231
Fuck.

I still can't believe they killed
her. Why would they kill her?

07:50.565 --> 07:53.166
She's completely harmless.
What had she done?

07:53.201 --> 07:55.168
- It's just utterly...
- Just, shut up!

07:55.769 --> 07:57.137
Please.

08:04.979 --> 08:08.683
Hey... Stay focused.

08:09.819 --> 08:14.289
Don't worry.
I'm very focused.

08:16.926 --> 08:18.293
I see.

08:23.933 --> 08:25.300
Yeah.

08:25.335 --> 08:28.937
That was the US base in Kosovo.
Donoghue just reported.

08:28.972 --> 08:30.781
He said they came under
fire, and had to abandon

08:30.806 --> 08:32.006
the rendezvous point.

08:32.676 --> 08:35.019
There's no information
on our men or any

08:35.044 --> 08:36.244
of the hostages.

08:36.380 --> 08:38.215
Thank you.

08:38.249 --> 08:41.686
Hasani is notoriously ruthless,
even by Balkan standards.

08:41.720 --> 08:45.790
I think we should assume by now
they are both non-operational.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.475
Hasani! Mr. Hasani!
Wait, wait, wait.

09:03.500 --> 09:04.543
Please. Please.

09:08.314 --> 09:10.482
Mr. Hasani.

09:10.516 --> 09:12.417
The man
Allen. The one that went

09:12.442 --> 09:14.496
with the girls. He's a spy!

09:15.021 --> 09:17.333
He's on some kind of
secret mission. He's the

09:17.358 --> 09:18.861
one they came for, not us.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.594
I think Allen may be
of great value to you!

09:28.400 --> 09:29.601
Thank you.

09:34.206 --> 09:35.573
God...

10:02.300 --> 10:03.700
What's that?

10:05.036 --> 10:09.807
Refrigeration. They want
to keep his body fresh.

10:09.841 --> 10:12.743
Why? What for?

10:12.778 --> 10:17.148
For Christ's sake, no,
you can't be serious.

10:18.717 --> 10:21.727
Hey! Hey!
Hey, wait up! Wait up!

10:25.090 --> 10:29.360
Hiya. Uh...little
souvenir of your stay.

10:30.595 --> 10:33.631
Ew, oh...

10:40.038 --> 10:42.907
Just breathe, yeah?

10:42.941 --> 10:44.643
Did you hear the sound that
made, when it hit the ground?

10:44.668 --> 10:45.868
Yeah.

10:46.412 --> 10:49.815
Unless this dude was a robot,
pretty sure I heard metal.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.163
Oh... Jackpot!

11:06.399 --> 11:08.800
Yours...

11:08.834 --> 11:10.950
"Old lady alive,
500 meters due East,

11:10.975 --> 11:11.970
Hasani's camp."

11:11.971 --> 11:15.940
All right...
Yep.

11:15.975 --> 11:19.277
Wait, wait, wait,
wait. Is that wise?

11:19.946 --> 11:21.113
I think so!

11:23.150 --> 11:24.487
Fuck!

11:36.537 --> 11:39.040
Get it off me!

11:39.075 --> 11:41.611
Ahhh! Get it off!

11:41.646 --> 11:42.846
Whoo! Shut up!

11:51.423 --> 11:55.727
Whoo!
That's a bit of fun.

11:57.796 --> 12:01.400
I love this country.
Think I'm gonna move here.

12:01.434 --> 12:05.237
We need to get going.
Uh...copy that.

12:05.272 --> 12:08.674
Take this. Go get Mrs. Heath,
and bring her back here.

12:08.708 --> 12:11.310
There's a bridge, about
a kilometer down the road.

12:11.344 --> 12:12.811
That way?
Yeah.

12:12.846 --> 12:14.347
All right, I'll meet you at
that bridge in one hour.

12:14.381 --> 12:16.882
If I'm not there, you
go on without me. Oy!

12:18.918 --> 12:20.952
Branko, come here.

12:22.288 --> 12:24.322
Mother fucker.

12:26.859 --> 12:29.594
Hey, hey!

12:29.628 --> 12:30.961
Ask him where
they took the girls.

12:35.166 --> 12:37.209
Then I'm gonna come and
kill Hasani! Hee, hee, hee.

12:38.119 --> 12:40.008
And you too! What's
that in your pocket?

12:40.356 --> 12:43.212
Cologne? You fucking
piece of shit.

12:43.942 --> 12:45.542
You dying, huh?

12:49.748 --> 12:50.948
Michael!

12:54.454 --> 12:56.421
You're fine.

12:56.923 --> 12:57.823
Oh!

12:59.859 --> 13:02.060
About time, you two.

13:02.094 --> 13:03.695
- Where'd you get the guns?
- Well, done.

13:03.729 --> 13:06.298
Our mysterious benefactor
left them for us.

13:06.332 --> 13:08.900
You're alive? You're alive.
That's good. That's good...

13:08.934 --> 13:11.269
All right, everyone off
the bridge, let's go.

13:13.105 --> 13:15.206
What the hell
happened to her?

13:15.240 --> 13:17.241
Found her in the trees,
next to some dead guards with

13:17.266 --> 13:18.666
these AK's stacked up for us.

13:19.444 --> 13:21.346
Get anything
off the driver?

13:21.380 --> 13:22.814
Yeah, his
AK and a phone.

13:22.848 --> 13:26.118
No signal on the phone.
Anything else?

13:26.152 --> 13:29.054
Yeah, he told us where they
took Allen and the girls.

13:29.088 --> 13:31.100
Some old military base
in the forest,

13:31.814 --> 13:33.714
a few hours south of here
on foot.

13:33.827 --> 13:35.361
The kid knows
where it is.

13:35.395 --> 13:37.393
That's Hasani's main place,
everything goes

13:37.394 --> 13:40.670
through there, drugs,
girls, weapons...

13:40.935 --> 13:42.135
Company, Mike go!

13:48.275 --> 13:50.243
Go, go!

13:57.018 --> 13:59.085
Fuck me!

13:59.120 --> 14:01.888
Michael, go forward.
Go forward!

14:08.128 --> 14:09.761
Fuck, I'm out...

14:09.796 --> 14:11.763
Move, move. I've got
you covered, just go!

14:11.797 --> 14:14.131
Michael, you give me those guns
and you take the hostages.

14:14.166 --> 14:15.800
Hey... Scott, I
told you before.

14:15.834 --> 14:18.770
My life is my call. Now get
the hell out of here. Go!

14:19.972 --> 14:21.173
Cover me!

14:26.480 --> 14:28.014
God fucking damn it!

14:46.267 --> 14:48.234
Will Michael be okay?

14:51.471 --> 14:54.773
Look, he had two
choices back there.

14:54.808 --> 14:57.242
One of those
was to retreat.

14:57.277 --> 14:59.311
He wouldn't have
done that, would he?

15:02.316 --> 15:03.683
I see.

15:05.186 --> 15:10.324
I should write and thank
his... Does he have a family?

15:12.261 --> 15:15.263
Yeah... He does.

15:16.299 --> 15:19.567
Excuse me,
excuse me?

15:20.736 --> 15:23.505
Is there a plan to
get us out of here?

15:24.907 --> 15:29.343
A man just gave his
life to save yours.

15:29.378 --> 15:32.379
You might at least
acknowledge that.

15:32.414 --> 15:38.285
Uh, plan is, we pick
up Allen, Dana, Adrijana...

15:38.319 --> 15:40.654
Then we head to the
extraction point. All right?

15:40.688 --> 15:42.823
What?
Yeah.

15:42.857 --> 15:44.925
Well, you make it sound as
if we're going out for...

15:44.959 --> 15:47.894
Dinner. I mean, they'll
be guarded, won't they?

15:47.929 --> 15:52.165
I mean, wouldn't it make
more sense to get home,

15:52.199 --> 15:54.494
and try and organize some
sort of a rescue,

15:54.519 --> 15:56.167
I mean,
a proper rescue?

15:56.970 --> 15:59.071
I mean...obviously
it's appalling,

15:59.106 --> 16:01.507
God knows, I don't know what's
gonna happen to them...

16:01.541 --> 16:04.505
But I... I'm covered
in fucking blood...

16:04.530 --> 16:05.730
It's all over me...

16:07.547 --> 16:08.914
I can't believe...

16:23.599 --> 16:24.799
You done?

16:26.835 --> 16:28.036
Yeah.

16:29.572 --> 16:31.373
You're a politician, right?

16:34.411 --> 16:36.346
So, let's put
it to a vote.

16:38.082 --> 16:39.749
All those In favor?

16:44.854 --> 16:48.957
Ain't democracy grand?
We keep moving.

17:19.489 --> 17:23.025
They have all been kidnapped
from their villages.

17:24.227 --> 17:25.926
Do they know where
they're going?

17:25.962 --> 17:29.082
Of course. Everyone knows
what happens to girls who

17:29.107 --> 17:30.307
are taken by Hasani.

17:30.899 --> 17:34.474
They are raped, then
addicted to heroin,

17:34.818 --> 17:36.905
then sold off to be slaves.

17:38.206 --> 17:41.075
There has to be some
kind of way out of this.

17:45.115 --> 17:47.417
Kerry Stonebridge.

17:47.451 --> 17:48.651
What?

17:48.686 --> 17:50.620
She just bought a
ticket at Heathrow Airport.

17:50.654 --> 17:53.223
- Where to?
- Here.

17:53.257 --> 17:55.025
He told her
he was in Vienna.

17:55.059 --> 17:58.128
That's all we need. Right,
go meet her at the airport.

18:16.152 --> 18:18.386
Ow, oh.
What...

18:18.420 --> 18:20.988
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

18:21.023 --> 18:24.525
- You okay? All right.
- Yeah, thanks.

18:28.230 --> 18:29.430
Nobody move!

18:33.169 --> 18:35.170
What is it?

18:35.205 --> 18:36.905
Why don't you stay
where you are?

18:37.540 --> 18:38.807
Mr. Scott?

18:39.575 --> 18:40.742
Fuck me.

18:47.183 --> 18:51.319
All right. Bad news is we're
standing in a minefield.

18:51.353 --> 18:53.855
The good news is we're
almost out of it. All right?

18:53.889 --> 18:55.490
We just gotta get
to those trees.

18:55.524 --> 18:58.126
Now, just do what
I say. Trust me.

18:58.193 --> 19:01.329
Trust you! You led us
into a fucking minefield!

19:01.363 --> 19:02.715
And I'm gonna lead you out.

19:03.685 --> 19:05.085
It's just gonna
take a bit of time.

19:08.070 --> 19:11.706
All right. I'm gonna go
first. Ma'am, okay?

19:13.076 --> 19:16.845
You follow, but leave at
least three paces behind.

19:16.880 --> 19:19.548
All right, you put your feet
exactly where I put mine.

19:19.583 --> 19:21.517
- Understood.
- Okay.

19:22.919 --> 19:25.587
- Branko.
- What about me?

19:25.622 --> 19:27.905
Branko, you fall in.

19:28.443 --> 19:30.523
This is the safe line,
behind Mrs Heath.

19:30.794 --> 19:33.118
All right? You need
to get over here,

19:33.143 --> 19:34.330
then you do the same.

19:34.331 --> 19:37.968
Three paces between us, watch
where you put your feet.

19:38.002 --> 19:40.537
- Okay?
- I said, what about me?

19:40.572 --> 19:42.673
Yeah, I heard
you the first time.

19:42.707 --> 19:44.808
Just stay calm, okay?

19:44.843 --> 19:46.593
You need to stay on this
same line.

19:46.934 --> 19:49.614
Come to us. Watch
where you put your feet.

19:50.349 --> 19:53.585
We cool? Yeah?

20:36.393 --> 20:39.929
Hold up...
It's okay.

20:41.465 --> 20:43.399
I'm still alive, fuckhead!

20:43.934 --> 20:45.101
Yeah.

20:47.838 --> 20:51.841
- Sorry, everyone okay? Good.
- Uh-huh.

20:59.683 --> 21:00.683
<i>Colonel?</i>

21:00.717 --> 21:02.785
Scott?
<i>Yeah.</i>

21:02.819 --> 21:03.920
Trace this number, now!

21:03.954 --> 21:05.021
I'm on it.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.890
<i>What is your situation?</i>

21:06.924 --> 21:10.227
I'm in a minefield. I got
three friendlies with me.

21:10.261 --> 21:11.562
Where's Stonebridge?

21:11.596 --> 21:14.198
He's MIA.

21:14.233 --> 21:16.467
- Please tell me you've got Allen?
- Negative.

21:16.502 --> 21:17.602
Where is he?

21:17.636 --> 21:19.671
Look, I need to get the
fuck out of here! Okay?

21:19.705 --> 21:21.339
We're getting a
fix on you now.

21:21.373 --> 21:22.607
Yeah.

21:24.510 --> 21:27.045
The mines, most
likely PMA-2's.

21:27.080 --> 21:28.885
The usual spread is
in grid formation,

21:28.910 --> 21:30.499
one every 10 square meters.

21:31.419 --> 21:33.053
Copy that.

21:33.087 --> 21:35.689
I'm putting you on
speaker, in my pocket.

21:38.360 --> 21:39.694
Everyone okay?

21:39.728 --> 21:41.262
Um...

21:42.931 --> 21:44.131
Fuck me.

21:54.275 --> 21:56.777
Fucki... Fuck...

21:59.614 --> 22:02.115
<i>Hey, hey, hey...</i>

22:02.149 --> 22:04.551
You're okay. You're okay.
'Kay?

22:04.585 --> 22:08.088
Now, now... I...
I should go back.

22:08.122 --> 22:09.489
No, Manning, no.

22:09.523 --> 22:12.926
- Yeah... I, I can retrace my steps.
- Manning, Manning...

22:12.960 --> 22:15.094
Please, just calm down.

22:15.128 --> 22:17.763
Okay? Please, shit...
Oh, ahhh!

22:17.797 --> 22:20.432
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa... You all right?

22:20.467 --> 22:23.602
You're okay,
you're okay.

22:23.636 --> 22:26.972
You're okay.
Off we go.

22:35.681 --> 22:38.049
I can't stay here...

22:38.084 --> 22:41.019
No, no, no,
no! Branko!

22:42.422 --> 22:43.622
Fuck me.

22:47.561 --> 22:49.695
Or you can do
it that way.

22:49.730 --> 22:52.732
I rather prefer your method,
thank you very much, Mr. Scott.

22:52.766 --> 22:53.933
So do I.

22:53.967 --> 22:57.003
I can't...
I can't stay here...

22:57.037 --> 22:59.372
Manning...
I can't stay here...

22:59.406 --> 23:01.607
I can't stay here...

23:01.641 --> 23:05.010
Manning...
I can't stay...

23:06.780 --> 23:08.848
No, Manning!

23:10.350 --> 23:12.451
Bloody hell, he's
gonna do it!

23:16.056 --> 23:18.190
Scott?

23:20.360 --> 23:22.694
Jesus Christ.

23:23.697 --> 23:26.731
Scott? Can you
get this back?

23:28.635 --> 23:29.835
Nothing.

23:40.313 --> 23:41.746
Sorry.

23:42.548 --> 23:43.715
Yeah.

23:48.221 --> 23:53.691
Colonel. We're out,
Manning didn't make it.

23:54.259 --> 23:55.593
Colonel?

23:56.861 --> 23:59.997
Fuck. Battery's dead.

24:00.699 --> 24:02.099
Come on.

24:42.542 --> 24:45.344
They choose us
now, for later.

25:04.565 --> 25:05.965
Hi.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.498
Mrs. Stonebridge, I'm
Colonel Eleanor Grant.

25:08.523 --> 25:09.536
May I come in?

25:09.537 --> 25:12.072
Yeah.
Thank you.

25:14.609 --> 25:18.178
I, um... I'm sorry
Michael's not here.

25:18.212 --> 25:20.813
A job came up at
the last minute.

25:20.848 --> 25:22.582
That's how it goes...

25:25.585 --> 25:27.586
Is Michael dead?

25:27.620 --> 25:29.034
I beg your pardon?

25:29.035 --> 25:30.425
He's missing presumed dead.

25:30.450 --> 25:32.870
You can't confirm it but you
want me to prepare myself.

25:33.792 --> 25:36.293
Michael is a quite
exceptional soldier.

25:43.835 --> 25:47.604
I came out to tell him
that he had to leave.

25:47.638 --> 25:52.242
If we're having a baby then
he'd have to leave Section 20.

25:53.812 --> 25:55.179
I see.

25:56.981 --> 25:59.716
I'd like to be alone now.

25:59.751 --> 26:04.187
If you need anything, there'll
be an officer in the lobby.

27:05.784 --> 27:07.952
Just in time, boys.

28:13.951 --> 28:15.085
Fatmir.

28:15.119 --> 28:17.388
It is an honor,
my friend.

28:20.625 --> 28:24.195
It is of great pride to me
that you should avail yourself

28:24.229 --> 28:26.363
of my various services.

28:26.398 --> 28:27.631
You've done as I asked?

28:27.666 --> 28:31.035
The weapon has been obtained
and transported to Chechnya

28:31.069 --> 28:32.903
as you requested.

28:35.873 --> 28:37.827
Ah, Mr. Allen.

28:38.462 --> 28:40.899
So you  enjoyed our little
kidnapping charade?

28:41.279 --> 28:43.347
I needed to bring
you here, in person,

28:43.381 --> 28:45.850
without making my
intentions too obvious.

28:45.884 --> 28:47.084
Have you got it?

28:49.855 --> 28:53.392
Twenty million dollars in
used notes and bearer bonds.

28:54.595 --> 28:56.496
As requested.

29:00.301 --> 29:03.103
You're wise to be cautious but
perhaps while you check it,

29:03.137 --> 29:05.472
you can hand my
associate your device...

29:05.506 --> 29:08.008
So he can start the
de-encryption process.

29:11.478 --> 29:13.946
Stay out
of sight, okay?

29:16.216 --> 29:20.219
You bad boys love your bells
and whistles, dot you?

29:20.254 --> 29:21.922
You think I keep
it on this?

29:23.191 --> 29:25.693
I deserve a bit more
credit than that.

29:26.895 --> 29:28.329
So where is it?

29:28.364 --> 29:29.698
In here.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.235
You might want a pen and
paper to write it down.

30:05.334 --> 30:08.002
Yeah...

30:48.611 --> 30:51.413
There you go.
Cheap at 20 million.

30:51.447 --> 30:53.381
Even cheaper for nothing.

30:54.483 --> 30:56.084
I can still be
useful to you.

30:56.118 --> 30:59.621
That, Mr. Allen, is
a decision for me.

31:09.466 --> 31:12.068
Get what you can from
it. Then destroy it.

31:13.570 --> 31:16.105
We can take your
car to the clinic.

31:48.605 --> 31:50.339
What do you got
there, buddy?

31:58.450 --> 32:03.388
Hey, hey, Allen, Allen...

32:03.422 --> 32:05.390
Hey, can't die
on me, yet.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.358
How do you know all
that shit about me?

32:07.393 --> 32:09.761
What happened
to me in Iraq?

32:10.663 --> 32:14.332
That consignment of WMD...

32:14.366 --> 32:16.935
You shouldn't have asked
so many questions...

32:16.969 --> 32:20.505
That shit is still out there.
He's going to use it.

32:20.540 --> 32:22.641
Who are you talking
about? Latif?

32:22.676 --> 32:25.277
What the fuck is Trojan
Horse? What is that?

32:25.312 --> 32:30.750
It's the gift that
keeps on killing.

32:32.353 --> 32:37.358
Mahmood, Bratton, Porter...
Yeah.

32:37.393 --> 32:40.461
What about Porter?
Did you set him up?

32:40.496 --> 32:44.499
Was that you?
No, that one's not on me.

32:44.533 --> 32:46.234
Scout's honor.

32:46.902 --> 32:48.002
Who was it?

32:48.036 --> 32:50.437
Who the fuck
was it? Fuck.

32:50.472 --> 32:54.974
Allen. Answer
me. Allen. Allen.

32:56.610 --> 32:57.843
Fuck.

33:23.036 --> 33:27.240
Shoosh.
Hey, hey, hey... It's okay.

33:39.019 --> 33:42.054
Hey. Don't worry. I'm
gonna get you out of here.

34:03.242 --> 34:04.642
How you doing?

34:10.851 --> 34:12.184
You okay?

34:13.286 --> 34:15.620
To be honest...
I'm fucking angry.

34:15.655 --> 34:17.956
That's good.
That's good.

34:17.991 --> 34:20.693
Here, I got
something for you.

34:20.726 --> 34:24.096
You want to get even?
You press those buttons.

34:51.324 --> 34:54.293
You all right?
Yeah.

34:54.328 --> 34:56.762
- Give me that. You okay?
- Yeah.

34:56.797 --> 35:01.033
Come on. Let's go.
Okay, Come on...

35:03.003 --> 35:04.203
Donoghue.

35:05.138 --> 35:06.304
Jesus.

35:07.040 --> 35:09.675
Scott. Hey, man.

35:11.278 --> 35:13.078
There's no hard feelings.

35:14.948 --> 35:16.834
We're gonna sort
this shit out, right?

35:16.835 --> 35:18.034
Sure.

35:22.089 --> 35:23.422
It's okay.

35:24.925 --> 35:26.092
Scott!

35:27.694 --> 35:28.828
Who the fuck are you?

35:28.862 --> 35:30.997
Kennedy. Military
Police.

35:33.266 --> 35:35.421
I spent three months
undercover, investigating

35:35.446 --> 35:36.602
that crooked asshole.

35:36.603 --> 35:38.037
You get to shoot
him, before I do.

35:38.071 --> 35:40.138
- Yeah.
- You lucky bastard.

35:40.173 --> 35:42.041
Yeah, sorry about that.

35:42.075 --> 35:44.576
I gotta get out of here. Man,
I gotta bail. This is a clusterfuck

35:44.611 --> 35:46.979
with you guys and the
goddamn CIA running around.

35:47.013 --> 35:48.514
What are you
talking about? CIA?

35:48.548 --> 35:51.216
Yeah, they took the hit on
Rama at the hostage handover.

35:51.251 --> 35:54.293
He killed American soldiers,
so Langley wanted him

35:54.318 --> 35:55.518
for their trophy room.

35:55.589 --> 35:57.156
You know where
they've got my friend?

35:57.190 --> 35:59.725
Oh, jeez. Do you
really want to know?

36:04.831 --> 36:08.728
So the income generated from
the organ farm helps to cover

36:08.753 --> 36:10.216
the cost of my militia...

36:11.537 --> 36:13.538
Ah, here is
Doctor Mullova.

36:13.572 --> 36:16.673
Doctor. Everything
been satisfactory?

36:16.708 --> 36:19.342
Quite satisfactory.

36:19.377 --> 36:22.596
I'd like to thank you once
again for the doctor's help

36:22.621 --> 36:24.117
in the training my people.

36:24.281 --> 36:27.350
As promised, Mr. Hasani has
made a more than adequate

36:27.384 --> 36:30.220
number of subjects available
to me for research.

36:30.254 --> 36:33.389
If you follow me, I will
show you the results.

36:33.424 --> 36:36.092
And you will be in a position
to relocate with me today?

36:36.761 --> 36:38.161
Absolutely.

36:57.285 --> 36:59.436
There's been a massive
explosion seven miles

36:59.461 --> 37:00.661
from the last known position.

37:03.291 --> 37:05.191
Who else could it be?

37:05.226 --> 37:09.195
So I wish you a safe
journey and every success.

37:12.165 --> 37:14.767
- There is one matter, Fatmir.
- Yes?

37:14.802 --> 37:16.783
I do not remember
agreeing that you should

37:16.808 --> 37:18.008
ransom the hostages.

37:19.806 --> 37:21.974
Look, I had no intention
of returning them.

37:22.008 --> 37:25.077
I merely saw an opportunity
to release my cousin

37:25.111 --> 37:27.145
and make the British
look foolish.

37:27.180 --> 37:31.015
In so doing, you drew the
CIA here, British military.

37:31.050 --> 37:33.211
You cost me
my most useful asset

37:33.236 --> 37:35.402
and risked drawing
attention to my presence...

37:37.188 --> 37:39.289
It will not happen again.

37:39.324 --> 37:40.557
You're right.

39:16.722 --> 39:18.422
Michael! You all right?

39:18.457 --> 39:21.759
- Fuck, Fuck...
- Hey, it's me, it's me, Michael.

39:21.794 --> 39:25.898
Fuck, Jesus... Come
on, come on, buddy...

39:27.334 --> 39:29.235
Oh yeah, yeah...

39:29.269 --> 39:33.573
Shit! It's a bit early
for Halloween, champ.

39:33.607 --> 39:35.314
- Kennedy, grab him!
- Yeah, I got him.

39:35.339 --> 39:36.539
Drag him up.
Drag him up.

39:41.648 --> 39:42.882
Michael!

39:48.689 --> 39:50.023
Hi, there.

40:14.015 --> 40:15.215
Scott!

40:15.249 --> 40:16.417
What is it?

40:17.185 --> 40:19.286
- Roadblock!
- Fuck!

40:31.865 --> 40:34.132
Hey, hey, hey...
Off the bus, off the bus...

40:34.167 --> 40:35.713
- Who the fuck are you?
- Don't do it, soldier!

40:35.738 --> 40:36.938
Huh? Who are you?

40:39.204 --> 40:40.404
Steady!

40:41.907 --> 40:43.607
Zero one...
Zero one?

40:43.642 --> 40:44.943
This is Kestrel 1.

40:44.968 --> 40:47.238
We have the hostages and
assorted civilians.

40:47.239 --> 40:49.707
Immediate medical evacuation required.
Zero one, buddy.

40:49.715 --> 40:53.150
Look at this, friends...

40:53.184 --> 40:56.987
We're going home.
Yeah? It's all good.

41:09.433 --> 41:11.334
You all right?

41:27.884 --> 41:27.916
Thanks.

41:34.191 --> 41:35.658
Hey, buddy.

41:36.726 --> 41:38.294
Where's the blonde?

41:40.364 --> 41:42.131
Haven't seen her...

41:42.166 --> 41:44.834
Do you have any new
conspiracy theories for me?

41:47.304 --> 41:49.105
Maybe some other time.

41:51.942 --> 41:53.109
Hi.

41:53.944 --> 41:55.478
Hey.

41:58.182 --> 42:00.783
You ever heard of anything
called Trojan Horse?

42:00.817 --> 42:02.718
What is it? A codename?

42:05.456 --> 42:06.656
I dunno.

42:08.326 --> 42:10.394
See you around.

42:10.428 --> 42:15.900
I can try to find out for
you. If that's what you want.

42:15.934 --> 42:17.235
Yeah.

42:19.972 --> 42:21.172
Thanks.

42:23.809 --> 42:26.177
It didn't feel right,
going on my own.

42:29.281 --> 42:31.148
We can't go on
like this, Michael.

42:34.319 --> 42:35.486
Hey...

42:41.192 --> 42:43.488
John Allen.

42:43.513 --> 42:45.086
- Quite a piece of work.
- Mmm...

42:46.397 --> 42:49.099
So we're de-encrypting the
PDA that Scott brought in?

42:49.134 --> 42:51.716
Yeah, Sergeant Richmond's
dealing with it.

42:51.741 --> 42:52.941
The program's up and running.

42:53.504 --> 42:57.239
Good, well, let's just hope
it gives us a lead on Latif.

42:57.274 --> 43:00.843
He and Allen had been
in contact for years.

43:00.878 --> 43:02.045
I think it's safe to assume

43:02.070 --> 43:03.969
that he gave
John Porter up to Latif.

43:05.316 --> 43:06.917
Thank you, Major.

43:07.752 --> 43:08.953
Colonel.

43:22.334 --> 43:24.635
How'd you get in here?

43:24.669 --> 43:27.070
I used all my Special
Forces Training...

43:37.515 --> 43:39.215
Don't you want me?

43:41.686 --> 43:43.520
You have no idea...

43:51.495 --> 43:54.097
The moment I met you...

43:55.699 --> 43:56.900
All I wanted...

43:58.703 --> 44:00.370
Was to not let you down.

44:00.405 --> 44:02.606
You haven't let me down.

44:24.194 --> 44:25.695
Well, then...

44:27.531 --> 44:30.567
This is exactly how I
want you to remember me.

44:31.670 --> 44:34.639
You know what?
What?

44:34.673 --> 44:36.574
You're pretty fucking cool.

45:00.730 --> 45:03.166
You out here just
in case I came by?

45:03.934 --> 45:05.135
Yeah.

45:05.803 --> 45:07.404
That's cute.

45:08.507 --> 45:10.174
- Shall we?
- We shall.
