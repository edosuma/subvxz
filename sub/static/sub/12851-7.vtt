Okay, Rapunzel,
I'm in a hurry
to get to school.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.672
What? Maya wouldn't say that.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.908
I've been held back by your
goody-moon-dust spell so long

00:42.910 --> 00:44.510
that I haven't done
any real damage

00:44.512 --> 00:46.311
to this high school
situation at all.

00:46.313 --> 00:47.679
Okay, then let's discuss.

00:47.681 --> 00:49.214
What kind of damage
we talking about?

00:49.216 --> 00:50.349
Damage.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.051
-I will allow you
just enough freedom
-No.

00:52.053 --> 00:53.970
-for one
fun-sized Maya episode
-No.

00:53.971 --> 00:55.888
-that gets my blood
pumping just a little bit.
-No. Ain't gonna cut it.

00:55.890 --> 00:58.690
Well, then I will allow one
medium-sized Maya episode

00:58.692 --> 00:59.925
that allows me to go,

00:59.927 --> 01:03.162
"Heavens to Betsy, Maya.
Will you never learn?"

01:03.164 --> 01:05.197
Listen, Petunia,
I've been living life

01:05.199 --> 01:06.598
on Candy Cane Lane
the past year

01:06.600 --> 01:09.168
and I am a pent-up,
boiling cauldron

01:09.170 --> 01:11.003
-of I'm-gonna-do-somethin'.
-I will allow you

01:11.005 --> 01:12.504
-just enough freedom

-Quiet!

01:12.506 --> 01:13.605
I run the show.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.574
You don't allow me.
I allow you.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.409
You want the old Maya back?

01:17.411 --> 01:19.411
Mama gonna do
a big, bad thing.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.414
Well, I don't believe
that you will.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.716
Because I only brought
you back to exactly where

01:24.718 --> 01:26.285
I need you to be,
and I was very careful

01:26.287 --> 01:27.453

Lucas.

02:46.433 --> 02:48.500
You mean "Farkle"?

02:48.502 --> 02:50.335
I mean "Lucas."

02:50.337 --> 02:51.370
Oh.

02:51.372 --> 02:52.671
I want to see
what you know.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.640
Okay, here's what I know.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.775
Farkle.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.177
Why, thank you.

02:58.179 --> 02:59.945
Pompeii was an ancient
village in Italy

02:59.947 --> 03:01.780
located near the beauty
and culture of Naples.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.650
It was a resort town
where the wealthy would go
to soak up the sun.

03:04.652 --> 03:06.618
It was like the Hawaii
of Italy.

03:08.155 --> 03:10.822
-Thanks, Lucas.
-Call on me any time.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.891
Pompeii sounds
so beautiful, Maya.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.126
We should go there.

03:14.128 --> 03:16.061
We should go there
and be calm.

03:16.063 --> 03:17.329
(Cory laughs)

03:17.331 --> 03:19.364
Let me tell you
about a whole city

03:19.366 --> 03:22.401
that became very calm
very quick.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.336
Now, who here knows
about Mount Vesuvius?

03:24.338 --> 03:27.256
Mount Vesuvius

03:27.257 --> 03:30.175
was a pent up, boiling cauldron
of I-wanna-do-somethin'.

03:30.177 --> 03:32.978
Vesuvius sat quiet
for a long time,

03:32.980 --> 03:36.515
but then it did
what volcanoes in time must do.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.584
It 'sploded!

03:38.586 --> 03:41.720
Why does a volcano
have to 'splode?

03:41.722 --> 03:44.990
Because if it doesn't,
it'll just blow up worse later.

03:44.992 --> 03:48.827
Vesuvius wiped out
the entire population
of Pompeii.

03:48.829 --> 03:51.096
It was one of the greatest
natural disasters

03:51.098 --> 03:52.397
the world had ever known.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.032
Okay, then do it right now.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.500
Do what you need to do
to be Maya,

03:55.502 --> 03:57.336
but please don't wipe us
all out, Peaches.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.504
(fire alarm ringing)

04:01.442 --> 04:02.574
That's it!

04:02.576 --> 04:04.209
Oh, a fire alarm!

04:04.211 --> 04:06.612
Ooh, you sassy troublemaker!

04:06.614 --> 04:08.413
Fire alarm, everybody!

04:08.415 --> 04:10.749
Yes! Oh, my gosh!

04:10.751 --> 04:12.618
This is bananas!

04:12.620 --> 04:14.620
-Your blood pumpin'?
-Oh, it's so pumpin'!

04:14.622 --> 04:16.421
-Good. I didn't do it.
-Yes, you did.

04:16.423 --> 04:19.091
Okay, single file,
everybody! Choo-choo!

04:19.093 --> 04:21.093
Everybody find
a safety buddy.

04:21.095 --> 04:22.561
My safety buddy is Maya.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.863
She exploded
and now she's tired.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.633
-Um, I didn't do it.
-Yes, you did!

04:27.635 --> 04:29.668
But you can't do anything more
for 3,000 years.

04:31.105 --> 04:33.238
Man on PA:
<i>Hello, students.</i>
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

04:33.240 --> 04:34.606
<i>A little glitch</i>
<i>in the system.</i>

04:34.608 --> 04:36.074
<i>False alarm.</i>
<i>Our mistake.</i>

04:36.076 --> 04:37.609
<i>Back to work.</i>

04:38.646 --> 04:40.245
You didn't do it,
Maya the Volcano?

04:40.247 --> 04:41.647
No explodey.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.248
Do you need a nappy?

04:43.250 --> 04:44.650
Wide awakey.

04:44.652 --> 04:47.452
Well, you're gonna wipe out
the whole village, ain't ya?

04:47.454 --> 04:49.454
And the neighboring towns.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.430
(panting)

04:58.432 --> 05:00.899
Doy, slow down, honey.
Breathe.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.801
(panting slows down)

05:02.803 --> 05:04.236
Okay.

05:04.238 --> 05:05.637
What happened?

05:05.639 --> 05:07.673
I am a bad Doy!

05:07.675 --> 05:10.509
-What do you mean?
-I'm a bad Doy.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.177
Did you hurt someone?

05:12.179 --> 05:14.246
I'm not a monster.

05:14.248 --> 05:15.981
Okay, of course not.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.683
I ate candy.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.518
Oh. Okay.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.620
Well, it's just not
that big of a deal.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.655
I actually snuck
some chocolate an hour ago.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.190
Every day
for a year!

05:25.192 --> 05:26.525
I know.

05:26.527 --> 05:27.693
Oh.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.695
We're back to you now.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.129
Okay, yeah, that is
a lot of candy.

05:31.131 --> 05:32.264
Maybe you should cut back.

05:32.266 --> 05:34.132
And I stoled it!

05:34.134 --> 05:35.600
He didn't know, Mom.

05:35.602 --> 05:37.936
He's been going
into Klawicki's candy store,

05:37.938 --> 05:40.372
but he didn't know
you had to pay for it.

05:40.374 --> 05:42.741
I just didn't know.

05:43.711 --> 05:46.445
Okay, you know, Doy,
this is actually a good thing.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.480
It means that
you have a conscience.

05:48.482 --> 05:49.715
What's that?

05:49.717 --> 05:52.484
It means when you do
something wrong, you feel bad.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.219
How do I get rid of it?

05:54.221 --> 05:56.488
You're stuck your whole life.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.724
I'm gonna take you back
to Mr. Klawicki's

05:58.726 --> 06:00.125
and you are going
to tell him the truth

06:00.127 --> 06:01.860
and then you're gonna feel
better because you did.

06:01.862 --> 06:02.994
Great!

06:02.996 --> 06:05.163
While we're there,
we'll take some candy!

06:05.165 --> 06:06.231
It's free!

06:07.534 --> 06:08.600
Oh, Doy.

06:14.842 --> 06:15.874
Explode!

06:15.876 --> 06:17.576
If you're going
to explode, explode!

06:17.578 --> 06:18.643
Just do it.
I can't wait.

06:18.645 --> 06:21.546
-Explode!
-(rumbling)

06:21.548 --> 06:23.582
What are you doing?

06:23.584 --> 06:27.319
(in bad British accent)
Mount Farkleuvius has awoken
in all its bubbling glory.

06:27.321 --> 06:28.320
What is that?

06:28.322 --> 06:30.889
That's my fancy
British guy Mortimer.

06:32.359 --> 06:33.592
Sounds like
you're eating meatloaf.

06:33.594 --> 06:36.027
Meatloaf.

06:36.029 --> 06:38.697
Okay, thing #211
he can't do, accents.

06:38.699 --> 06:42.000
Oh, but it's so charming
when he can't do things.

06:42.002 --> 06:44.569
He's a face! He's just a face!
What's the matter with you?

06:44.571 --> 06:49.274
Mount Farkleuvius sends
two billion tons of burning lava
straight into the air.

06:49.276 --> 06:51.910
-(sputtering)
-And right back down
on his head.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.178
-(giggles)
-Why?

06:53.180 --> 06:55.113
Because you insulted Mortimer!

06:55.115 --> 06:56.214
What's his last name?

06:56.216 --> 06:57.883
Twiggle-bottom-smythe.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.684
(laughs)

07:00.788 --> 07:01.853
Okay fine, I'll do it.

07:02.890 --> 07:05.357
(sputters)

07:06.427 --> 07:08.026
Maya, what's going on with you?

07:09.062 --> 07:11.396
It's like I don't have
a role here anymore.

07:11.398 --> 07:12.531
Riley the Sweet,

07:12.533 --> 07:14.232
Farkle the Genius,
Lucas the Good--

07:14.234 --> 07:15.801
Ugh, I thought that was gone.

07:15.803 --> 07:16.701
It's not gone.
I'm gone.

07:16.703 --> 07:17.769
I'm the one that's gone.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.371
Maya, I've been down this road.

07:19.373 --> 07:21.373
Forget it.
I missed a whole year of school

07:21.375 --> 07:22.774
because I thought
I had to be something.

07:22.776 --> 07:23.975
That doesn't get you anywhere.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.744
Yeah, and now you say
"please" and "thank you,"

07:25.746 --> 07:27.412
and what does that get you?

07:27.414 --> 07:28.780
It gets me to like him.

07:28.782 --> 07:29.981
Do you still like him?

07:29.983 --> 07:31.716
I don't know
what I like anymore.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.152
Whoa.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.955
No "whoa."
No "whoa" while
I'm figuring things out.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.056
Whoa.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.291
We're getting older.

07:39.293 --> 07:40.659
These are gonna be
more unpredictable.

07:40.661 --> 07:43.295
-I'm telling Smackle.
-I'm telling Smackle!

07:44.798 --> 07:46.164
Maya?

07:46.166 --> 07:48.133
I need to know who I am
before I know what I like.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.836
Hey, you know
what's up with me?

07:50.838 --> 07:54.072
The cash register
is short $100.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.340
So what's up with you?

07:55.342 --> 07:56.575
That's great.

07:56.577 --> 07:59.311
You know what's up with me?
Who took my $100?

08:02.015 --> 08:03.682
Just do it.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.450
I didn't take the money.

08:05.452 --> 08:06.485
Yes, you did!

08:06.487 --> 08:07.786
Maya, you took the money!

08:07.788 --> 08:09.087
She took the money, everybody!

08:09.089 --> 08:11.790
Yeah! She's a cat burglar!

08:11.792 --> 08:13.291
-I didn't do it.
-Yes, you did.

08:13.293 --> 08:14.626
This is all over.

08:14.628 --> 08:17.863
Well, if no one took my $100,
then what happened?

08:17.865 --> 08:20.499
Huh? Somebody just put
two 50s under the whole drawer

08:20.501 --> 08:21.867
and forgot
all about it?

08:21.869 --> 08:23.268
Somebody just...

08:23.270 --> 08:24.736
did that.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.273
Stay in school, kids.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.843
I don't want my role with us
to be someone you think

08:31.845 --> 08:34.813
takes money
or sets off fire alarms.

08:34.815 --> 08:37.282
You think you know
what I'm capable of?

08:37.284 --> 08:39.184
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

08:40.988 --> 08:43.221
You guys want
the Maya back,

08:43.223 --> 08:45.257
the Maya I really am?

08:46.727 --> 08:47.759
You got her.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.636
Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!

08:57.638 --> 08:59.638
Way to go, Mom.
They're gonna put Doy away.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.706
This is ridiculous.
He's a little kid!

09:01.708 --> 09:03.675
Yeah, well, according
to the candy store owner,

09:03.677 --> 09:05.577
this kid is
public enemy number one.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.746
What's your side
of the story, counselor?

09:07.748 --> 09:09.848
Well, he is a sweet
and innocent child,

09:09.850 --> 09:11.349
the candy was sitting out
in plain view,

09:11.351 --> 09:12.517
he always thought
it was for him.

09:12.519 --> 09:13.919
Mm-hmm.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.754
Are you sweet
and innocent, kid?

09:18.258 --> 09:19.724
All right, Dewey.

09:19.726 --> 09:23.094
Doooy!

09:23.096 --> 09:27.499
Doooy!

09:27.501 --> 09:31.403
This kid is going awaaay!

09:32.372 --> 09:34.239
My friend is sensitive
about his name.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.874
He likes to be called Doy.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.275
Yeah?

09:37.277 --> 09:40.912
Well, Doy has been taking candy
for a long time now.

09:40.914 --> 09:41.746
You want some?

09:41.748 --> 09:43.515
That's evidence, kid.

09:43.517 --> 09:45.784
You just can't go around
eating-- Okay, give me some.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.853
Look...

09:48.855 --> 09:51.256
Doy's been stealing candy
every day for a year.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.958
And the cars!

09:56.096 --> 09:58.463
Mr. Klawicki just wants
to be reimbursed.

09:58.465 --> 10:00.732
He wants $300.

10:00.734 --> 10:03.868
I got six rocks and a turtle.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.837
Don't take my turtle!

10:07.941 --> 10:09.774
You're gonna have
to work it off.

10:09.776 --> 10:10.809
Dance, Doy! Dance!

10:17.317 --> 10:19.451
Nice moves, kid.
(chuckles)

10:19.453 --> 10:21.653
Look, we're gonna
talk to his parents.

10:21.655 --> 10:22.787
-They'll pay the money.
-Okay.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.789
In the meantime,
Doy will stay out

10:24.791 --> 10:26.691
of the candy store
for a while.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.294
Are we good?

10:29.296 --> 10:30.929
-We're good.
-Good.

10:30.931 --> 10:34.566
This is my neighborhood.
I will enforce the law.

10:34.568 --> 10:35.634
I know.

10:35.636 --> 10:37.002
You've got a tough job.
We thank you.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.937
You're very welcome.

10:38.939 --> 10:42.173
Say, kid, wanna take a ride
in a real police car?

10:42.175 --> 10:44.743
Yeah! Want some more evidence?

10:44.745 --> 10:46.478
Yeah!

10:49.116 --> 10:51.249
Sometimes, the system works.

10:57.024 --> 10:59.691
If you choose to live
next door to a volcano,

10:59.693 --> 11:00.959
why should you be surprised

11:00.961 --> 11:02.861
by the destruction
that comes with it?

11:02.863 --> 11:04.529
Because they lived
next to it so long.

11:04.531 --> 11:05.964
Maybe they forgot
what it was.

11:05.966 --> 11:06.831
Because it's not.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.099
What?

11:08.101 --> 11:09.834
'Cause you've always lived
right next to it

11:09.836 --> 11:12.437
and you have faith
that it would never do
anything bad to you.

11:12.439 --> 11:13.772
Where is she?

11:13.774 --> 11:15.206
She's cutting school?

11:15.208 --> 11:16.841
That's what she decided to do.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.011
Our question for discussion is:

11:20.013 --> 11:22.380
There's a whole world
out there, Pompeii,

11:22.382 --> 11:24.883
why live next to
a volcano then? Huh?

11:24.885 --> 11:26.451
Farkle.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.653
The soil from volcanoes grows
the most beautiful flowers.

11:28.655 --> 11:30.021
And deep down,
Maya is beautiful.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.023
Okay, calm down.

11:33.727 --> 11:34.959
You live in Ireland.

11:34.961 --> 11:39.030
You learn that there's
over 300 days of rain a year.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.383
On the other hand,

11:41.384 --> 11:43.735
it's one of the most beautiful,
green places on Earth.

11:43.737 --> 11:46.037
And places, like people,

11:46.039 --> 11:47.972
offer wonderful peaks
and valleys.

11:47.974 --> 11:51.710
Now, what makes these
wonderful peaks and valleys?

11:51.712 --> 11:52.977
Volcanoes?

11:52.979 --> 11:55.196
Right.

11:55.197 --> 11:57.414
It's up to you to understand
what you've chosen to live with.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.751
Learn from Pompeii.

11:59.753 --> 12:02.087
As you live
next to each other,
understand that

12:02.089 --> 12:04.089
every once in a while,
things explode.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.256
That's nature.

12:05.258 --> 12:08.059
And that's human nature.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.113
(rattling)

13:19.633 --> 13:20.799
(door opens)

13:24.738 --> 13:26.905
-Hart?
-Hart!

13:28.108 --> 13:29.674
It's you, isn't it?

13:29.676 --> 13:31.442
It's me. Carla?

13:31.444 --> 13:33.978
It's been a while.
Nice jacket.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.013
Oh, thanks.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.581
Give it to me.

13:38.852 --> 13:41.252
-Oh, man, I'm just
messing with you, Hart.
-(Maya chuckles)

13:41.254 --> 13:42.821
Messin' with you!

13:44.024 --> 13:46.191
You know, I just came back
to visit a little.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.626
It's, uh, almost dark.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.461
It's a little scary here
after dark.

13:50.463 --> 13:52.163
I appreciate that, thanks.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.933
Looks like she's prepared
for it though.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.367
Where's that
little friend of yours?

13:56.369 --> 13:57.535
-Dorothy.
-Riley.

13:57.537 --> 13:58.603
Dorothy.

13:58.605 --> 14:01.306
You two are like
those stuck-together twins.

14:01.308 --> 14:03.141
There's a word for that.
What's that called?

14:03.143 --> 14:04.275
Sesame twins.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.744
You see what
you left me here with?

14:08.014 --> 14:10.348
-Dorothy kid's stupid.
-Well, her name's Riley.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.717
She's all, "I'm Dorothy.
I got a perfect life.

14:12.719 --> 14:14.352
I'm Little Miss Perfect Life."

14:14.354 --> 14:16.154
You sound jealous.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.022
I'm not jealous of anything.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.390
I just want
what she has.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.226
(both chuckle)

14:21.228 --> 14:22.961
Miss you around here, man.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.529
What's with the brick
and the hammer?

14:24.531 --> 14:25.964
You gonna build a house?

14:25.966 --> 14:27.565
She's Maya Hart.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.133
She's gonna burn
the joint down.

14:29.135 --> 14:30.501
Nah, look at her.

14:30.503 --> 14:31.703
She's changed.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.071
She's soft like Dorothy.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.807
Now, I'm gonna need you
to start calling her Riley.

14:35.809 --> 14:37.308
You're soft like Riley.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.743
How's that?

14:40.480 --> 14:41.746
I'm not soft.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.415
Yeah, you are
a little bit.

14:44.417 --> 14:45.750
That's okay.

14:45.752 --> 14:46.985
Can always fix that.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.653
And you know
how you fix things?

14:48.655 --> 14:50.421
With a hammer.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.056
Okay.

14:54.094 --> 14:55.827
Got a lot of
equipment here, Hart.

14:55.829 --> 14:58.396
Could do a lot
of damage with that.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.399
Is that what
you come here for?

15:01.401 --> 15:03.635
See what you're still
capable of?

15:05.105 --> 15:07.171
Yeah.

15:07.173 --> 15:10.375
Yeah, I came here to see
what I'm still capable of.

15:10.377 --> 15:11.943
Good.

15:11.945 --> 15:15.246
Because I'd love to have
you back here instead of Renee.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.115
Yeah, instead of Renee.

15:18.518 --> 15:21.085
Now, this is what
a hammer is capable of.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.791
Okay, slugger, let's give
someone else a chance.

15:28.228 --> 15:31.029
Show us what
you got... softy.

15:47.414 --> 15:49.113
You're weak, Hart.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.648
I know it.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.050
You know it.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.451
You're not one of us.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.219
I'm one of us.

15:55.221 --> 15:58.056
You'd love to have
me back here now,
wouldn't you, Carla?

15:58.058 --> 16:00.191
(dryly)
Yeah, Renee. Come back.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.895
Because Hart's showed us
what she's got.

16:03.897 --> 16:05.730
Nothin'.

16:05.732 --> 16:08.599
You chose
the wrong group
of friends.

16:08.601 --> 16:12.337
You chose her,
and she made you weak.

16:12.339 --> 16:13.938
So, why don't you just say

16:13.940 --> 16:15.974
she made you weak
and go home?

16:15.976 --> 16:17.241
Maya:
No.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.744
Because I'm not weak.

16:19.746 --> 16:22.347
Oh yeah? Prove it.

16:22.349 --> 16:25.183
Take this hammer from me
and prove it.

16:25.185 --> 16:28.820
Or I'm gonna knock
Little Miss Perfect's head
right off in front of you

16:28.822 --> 16:30.922
'cause I don't see
anyone here who can stop me.

16:35.261 --> 16:36.427
Yeah, there is.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.697
'Cause I've got the brick

16:39.699 --> 16:41.833
and I've got the hammer.

16:41.835 --> 16:43.668
Good for you, Hart.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.370
You know what
you're gonna do with those?

16:49.709 --> 16:52.377
I know exactly what
I'm gonna do with those.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.713
I know exactly who I am.

17:08.828 --> 17:09.994
Where is she?

17:09.996 --> 17:11.462
It's my fault.
I'm not there to stop her.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.364
It's not your fault.
You're her best friend.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.066
I only wanted
her to find herself.

17:15.068 --> 17:16.200
Not for her to explode.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.468
We don't know
that she exploded.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.703
We don't know
what she did.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.538
(knock on door)

17:20.540 --> 17:22.407
You can't be with her
all the time, Riley.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.809
The job of being
somebody's best friend

17:24.811 --> 17:27.045
is to make sure that
even when you're not with them,

17:27.047 --> 17:28.312
-you're still there.
-(door opens)

17:30.984 --> 17:32.650
You have failed.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.219
Baby girl,
what did you do?

17:35.221 --> 17:37.088
New York code 145.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.322
Vandalism?

17:38.324 --> 17:39.357
-What?
-What?

17:39.359 --> 17:40.425
Maya.

17:40.427 --> 17:41.826
You.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.161
You did this.

17:43.163 --> 17:44.429
Put me in jail
for the rest of my life

17:44.431 --> 17:46.264
and don't allow visitors
or else she'll come

17:46.266 --> 17:48.499
and bring me a stupid
lemon meringue pie!

17:49.736 --> 17:52.336
It's for you
and all your jailbird friends.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.907
Your the girl whose head
she put back on.

17:55.909 --> 17:57.041
What?

17:57.043 --> 17:58.776
She's my best friend
and she ruined me!

17:58.778 --> 18:01.345
Well, she's my best friend
and I love her.

18:02.382 --> 18:03.981
We couldn't find her.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.119
Looks like somebody found her.

18:08.121 --> 18:09.454
Maya, what did you do?

18:09.456 --> 18:12.223
She did a number
on a public park.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.058
A park on my beat.

18:14.060 --> 18:15.426
My park.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.261
I watch that park every day.

18:17.263 --> 18:18.329
I'm sorry.

18:20.066 --> 18:22.100
You all care
about this girl?

18:22.102 --> 18:23.201
We do.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.971
Well, we're gonna take
a little field trip.

18:26.973 --> 18:30.274
I'm gonna show you all
just want this girl did
to my park.

18:30.276 --> 18:31.375
Let's go.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.378
You did this.

18:34.380 --> 18:35.413
What?

18:35.415 --> 18:37.148
Maya, I wasn't even with you.

18:37.150 --> 18:39.717
Yeah, you were.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.943
I had a brick
in my hand.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.078
Why?

19:09.315 --> 19:11.415
Because somebody
went after you.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.651
Who, Maya?

19:13.653 --> 19:16.053
These two girls
I used to know.

19:17.323 --> 19:19.524
I could have been them.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.692
Riley, I would have been them.

19:23.196 --> 19:24.328
But I'm not.

19:26.099 --> 19:28.699
Because they think a hammer
and a brick makes you strong.

19:28.701 --> 19:32.503
And as much as I wanted to throw
a brick through a window,

19:32.505 --> 19:35.273
I know that if I did that,

19:35.275 --> 19:37.175
that's what would
make me weak.

19:38.645 --> 19:40.478
I'm strong...

19:40.480 --> 19:43.414
because there's something
inside me that stops me now.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.784
It knows how important
you've been in my life

19:46.786 --> 19:49.453
and it'll never let me
do any real damage

19:49.455 --> 19:50.721
as long as I live.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.425
That part inside me...

19:55.962 --> 19:57.695
I'm gonna call it Dorothy.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.466
Call it whatever you want.

20:02.468 --> 20:05.303
I'm just glad that
you didn't do anything bad.

20:06.306 --> 20:08.139
Yeah.

20:08.141 --> 20:10.541
How come I ain't bad, Matthews?

20:10.543 --> 20:14.245
The friends we choose can have
the most profound influence

20:14.247 --> 20:16.380
in our entire lives,

20:16.382 --> 20:17.982
one way or the other.

20:18.985 --> 20:20.818
This way.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.753
I'm proud of you, Maya.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.322
What happened
to the girls?

20:24.324 --> 20:27.425
Oh, well, I might have had
a brick and a hammer,

20:27.427 --> 20:29.760
and I might have swung them
over my head a little bit

20:29.762 --> 20:32.396
and ran, like,
right towards 'em
like I was--

20:32.398 --> 20:33.564
Maya?

20:33.566 --> 20:35.366
So, you're Maya again?

20:35.368 --> 20:37.501
Well, they seem
to think so.

20:37.503 --> 20:39.670
They ran away so fast.

20:43.076 --> 20:44.575
My park.

20:45.511 --> 20:47.578
I watch this park every day.

20:48.881 --> 20:49.947
I'm sorry.

20:52.852 --> 20:55.419
You know, I'm not gonna give up
on that Carla and Renee.

20:57.090 --> 20:59.590
And I don't want
you to be like them, okay?

20:59.592 --> 21:00.925
I can't.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.160
Dorothy won't let me.

21:05.131 --> 21:08.399
New York code 145.

21:08.401 --> 21:09.533
Vandalism.

21:11.137 --> 21:12.503
I'm gonna write this one up.

21:13.439 --> 21:15.373
Then I'm gonna put it
into a folder.

21:15.375 --> 21:18.409
Then I'm gonna
misplace the folder.

21:18.411 --> 21:21.979
And if I never hear from
you two little hoodlums
ever again,

21:21.981 --> 21:24.782
that folder remains misplaced.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.320
I'm a hoodlum.

21:32.392 --> 21:34.158
Why are you giving me a break?

21:36.095 --> 21:37.461
My park.

21:39.399 --> 21:41.565
I look at this park every day.

21:43.336 --> 21:45.636
I have hope
for this park, too.

21:47.507 --> 21:48.572
Thank you.

21:50.743 --> 21:52.109
Thank you.

21:52.111 --> 21:55.479
Hey, sometimes
the system works.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.956
Thanks for putting
my head back on.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.325
Yeah.

22:08.628 --> 22:09.493
You, too.

22:19.806 --> 22:21.439
Huh.

22:21.441 --> 22:22.673
Yeah.

22:24.877 --> 22:26.444
Before I knew you--

22:26.446 --> 22:28.112
You always knew me.

22:28.114 --> 22:30.314
When I was real young,

22:30.316 --> 22:34.218
I used to come to this park
and look at this statue

22:34.220 --> 22:37.888
and wonder if I would ever
have friends as good as these.

22:37.890 --> 22:41.025
That would hold hands
with each other and smile.

22:42.195 --> 22:45.029
I used to wonder what it was
they were so happy about.

22:46.733 --> 22:48.299
Now I know.
