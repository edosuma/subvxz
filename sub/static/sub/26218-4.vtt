WEBVTT

00:39.901 --> 00:41.558
He's a fast learner.

00:41.662 --> 00:43.802
He looks more
relaxed than Trav.

00:46.977 --> 00:48.565
Photographer: Can I pinch you
in here for me?

00:48.669 --> 00:49.808
Hi. Sorry.

00:49.911 --> 00:51.016
They're just asking me
to squish in.

00:51.120 --> 00:52.293
Nah, you're alright.
Get in here.

00:52.397 --> 00:54.054
Sorry. It never
gets any less weird.

00:54.157 --> 00:55.848
Man: Uh, bit closer.

00:55.952 --> 00:57.160
Closer.

00:57.264 --> 00:58.920
Uh, lovely, and holding
there for me.

00:59.024 --> 01:01.544
It's probably best that
she's not here to see this.

01:01.647 --> 01:03.960
It was Paige's choice
not to be here.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.411
I'm Cassie, by the way.

01:06.514 --> 01:08.482
Daniel. Or Dan.

01:08.585 --> 01:10.139
Uh, Daniel.
Yeah, I know.

01:10.242 --> 01:11.795
Um, I'm a friend
of Tahlia's.

01:11.899 --> 01:14.246
I've been really looking
forward to meeting you.

01:14.350 --> 01:17.284
Oh. Cheers.

01:17.387 --> 01:18.630
Thanks.

01:18.733 --> 01:20.010
And holding.

01:20.114 --> 01:22.565
Almost there.

01:22.668 --> 01:24.291
Lovely.
Thank you very much.

01:29.744 --> 01:32.299
Looks like somebody
else wants you.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.799
♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:49.902 --> 01:53.009
♪ Yeah

01:53.113 --> 01:57.255
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

02:02.950 --> 02:04.158
God, it's good
to see you. Mwah!

02:04.262 --> 02:06.574
Good to see you.
Bye.

02:09.612 --> 02:11.614
Daniel's having
a good time.

02:11.717 --> 02:13.892
Well, I wouldn't have
come if I was her.

02:13.995 --> 02:15.480
Yes, you would.

02:15.583 --> 02:17.413
Okay, well, I probably would've,
but that's not the point.

02:17.516 --> 02:19.035
What is the point?

02:19.139 --> 02:21.417
We don't know that she's the one
that went to press.

02:21.520 --> 02:23.488
Not categorically.

02:23.591 --> 02:24.972
And if it's
not just a rumor

02:25.075 --> 02:26.491
and they really
are rooting around...

02:26.594 --> 02:28.424
Oh, look, I don't care.
I -- I don't care

02:28.527 --> 02:30.840
if Jessie's screwing
the entire team.

02:30.943 --> 02:33.291
What Jessie does or does
not do is her business,

02:33.394 --> 02:34.533
no one else's.

02:34.637 --> 02:36.259
Especially now.

02:36.363 --> 02:38.710
Paige just needs to learn
to keep her mouth shut.

02:46.407 --> 02:47.546
Where's Rusty today?

02:47.650 --> 02:49.790
He's probably avoiding you,
Neil.

02:49.893 --> 02:52.758
Where the fuck is he?Yeah, alright.

02:52.862 --> 02:54.933
Did either of you know about his
affair with Jessie Davies?

02:55.036 --> 02:57.763
We're not here to feed
malicious rumors.

02:57.867 --> 03:00.041
How do you know
it's not true?

03:00.145 --> 03:01.353
Are you suggesting
team members

03:01.457 --> 03:02.872
don't sleep
with each other's partners?

03:02.975 --> 03:04.598
I'm not suggesting
anything.

03:04.701 --> 03:07.601
I'm stating that today is about
an exciting new product

03:07.704 --> 03:11.225
from our major sponsors,
wotev.com.

03:11.329 --> 03:13.296
Okay. Can you
tell us about that?

03:15.471 --> 03:17.818
Dan?

03:17.921 --> 03:20.269
Uh, yeah.
Uh, absolutely. Um...

03:20.372 --> 03:22.340
Yeah, when they guys
from wotev.com ran us

03:22.443 --> 03:24.859
through it all, I mean, yeah,
it's clearly a game changer.

03:24.963 --> 03:27.517
Any actual information
about the product itself, boys?

03:27.621 --> 03:29.381
Uh, yeah.
Sorry, Neil.

03:29.485 --> 03:30.762
I know you're having fun there,

03:30.865 --> 03:33.247
but can I just grab
the boys for a sec?

03:33.351 --> 03:34.559
Circulate.

03:34.662 --> 03:36.250
Have a cracker.

03:47.641 --> 03:48.918
Oh!

03:49.021 --> 03:50.057
Ah!

03:53.198 --> 03:54.579
Thank you.

03:58.238 --> 04:01.068
Kath.

04:01.171 --> 04:03.173
You know, we're gonna keep
bumping into each other.

04:03.277 --> 04:05.969
So you might as well
talk to me.

04:06.073 --> 04:08.800
We're talking
right now.

04:08.903 --> 04:11.181
Nah, I mean privately.

04:11.285 --> 04:12.528
That's not going
to happen.

04:12.631 --> 04:15.324
Tahlia doesn't get
where my head's at.

04:15.427 --> 04:17.705
You're the only one
that doesn't judge me.

04:17.809 --> 04:19.880
Don't be ridiculous.

04:19.983 --> 04:21.951
I'm judging you
right now.

04:27.784 --> 04:29.441
I'm just asking you
to talk to me.

04:31.719 --> 04:33.618
No, you're not.

04:52.878 --> 04:55.502
Well, I know
it wasn't the most

04:55.605 --> 04:57.262
boring thing
I've ever done,

04:57.366 --> 05:00.092
but it was probably
in the top 10.

05:00.196 --> 05:02.957
What'd you get up to?

05:03.061 --> 05:05.235
I got so much done.

05:05.339 --> 05:06.409
Did you?
Nah.

05:06.513 --> 05:08.169
I got nothing done.
Know why?

05:08.273 --> 05:11.380
That's a freak photo.

05:11.483 --> 05:13.451
That's got to be
the one time I smiled.

05:16.108 --> 05:18.663
I was just being polite.

05:18.766 --> 05:20.181
She's, um,
one of Tahlia's mates.

05:20.285 --> 05:21.217
Actually,
you would've liked her.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.184
Course she is.

05:23.288 --> 05:24.738
What's that supposed to mean?Nothing.

05:24.841 --> 05:27.292
I'm just not loving you
in a boob sandwich.

05:27.396 --> 05:30.053
Paige, you were invited.

05:30.157 --> 05:32.159
Did you just spend the whole
night sitting on social media?

05:32.262 --> 05:34.713
No.
I called Mum.

05:34.817 --> 05:37.198
She didn't answer.

05:37.302 --> 05:39.200
Also I went a couple of rounds
with your punching bag

05:39.304 --> 05:40.926
after a binge.

05:41.030 --> 05:43.584
I gave myself
a gimpy ankle.

05:43.688 --> 05:46.069
Are you okay?
No.

05:46.173 --> 05:47.692
I'm Scotty No Mates.

05:47.795 --> 05:49.797
No, you're not.

05:51.868 --> 05:54.008
Where?

05:54.112 --> 05:55.907
Where are my mates?

05:56.010 --> 05:57.149
Hmm?

05:57.253 --> 05:58.461
Why don't you invite
your teacher buddies

05:58.565 --> 06:00.049
around to ours
for a drink?

06:00.152 --> 06:01.913
Just chuck it
out there.

06:02.016 --> 06:03.224
No pressure.

06:03.328 --> 06:05.951
Just keep it caj.

06:12.924 --> 06:16.755
Um...
Can I ask you something?

06:16.859 --> 06:18.447
Off the record.

06:18.550 --> 06:20.966
What do uni students
use these days?

06:21.070 --> 06:22.968
To stay awake?

06:23.072 --> 06:25.039
Apart from coffee
and sugar?

06:25.143 --> 06:28.698
Just -- just a bit
of a leg-up, as it were.

06:28.802 --> 06:30.320
In my day, we did
a little bit of, uh,

06:30.424 --> 06:32.461
cold and flu
over the counter.

06:32.564 --> 06:35.256
But there must be something
better around these days.

06:35.360 --> 06:38.398
Just your standard
issue study aid.

06:38.501 --> 06:40.779
Nothing illegal.

06:40.883 --> 06:42.678
If you're asking me
what I do to improve

06:42.781 --> 06:44.369
my focus and stamina,

06:44.473 --> 06:46.992
I eat a balanced diet,
I exercise, I meditate,

06:47.096 --> 06:50.375
and I always make time
in my day just for me.

06:50.479 --> 06:52.101
Oh.

06:54.724 --> 06:58.279
Dan, you've never been
fitter in your life.

06:58.383 --> 07:01.213
I swear, my skin folds
just don't go down.

07:01.317 --> 07:03.077
You're exceeding
everyone's expectations

07:03.181 --> 07:04.320
week after week.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.253
It doesn't matter.

07:06.356 --> 07:07.323
The better I do,

07:07.427 --> 07:10.878
the more they expect.

07:10.982 --> 07:13.122
The more I expect
from myself.

07:13.225 --> 07:15.262
No one expects
as much as you do.

07:15.365 --> 07:17.920
Aside from me.Aside from you.

07:18.023 --> 07:19.542
What are you up to today?

07:19.646 --> 07:21.061
I've got class
in the morning,

07:21.164 --> 07:22.890
but a double free
after lunch.

07:22.994 --> 07:25.583
Ah...

07:25.686 --> 07:26.756
Give us a look.

07:26.860 --> 07:29.621
Oh!

07:29.725 --> 07:32.279
Paige, we better
get that checked out.

07:32.382 --> 07:34.868
Actually, I'm pretty sure
that Lauren's on early today.

07:34.971 --> 07:37.871
I might give her a call.

07:37.974 --> 07:41.426
G'day. Um, I was just
chasing Dr. Gambi, please.

07:41.530 --> 07:42.876
Daniel Fletcher.

07:42.979 --> 07:44.567
I can't be seen by those
women in my workwear.

07:44.671 --> 07:46.949
And I'm in no mood
to wear acceptable shoes.

07:47.052 --> 07:48.813
Okay. A -- they don't hang out
at the club.

07:48.916 --> 07:50.539
And, B -- what,
are you avoiding them now?

07:50.642 --> 07:52.541
They started it.

07:52.644 --> 07:54.543
Oh, hi.
It's Dan Fletcher.

07:54.646 --> 07:57.477
No, no, actually,
my girlfriend's hurt herself.

07:57.580 --> 08:00.687
Is there any chance
that Lauren could...?

08:00.790 --> 08:02.205
She can see you
in two hours.

08:02.309 --> 08:03.897
What if I don't
want to be seen?

08:08.418 --> 08:11.352
Andrew specifically told
the sponsor you'd be there.

08:11.456 --> 08:13.700
You don't turn up, and you don't
even answer your phone.

08:13.803 --> 08:15.736
Ran out of charge.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.462
You've been
late all week.

08:17.566 --> 08:20.085
You're barely functioning
when you do show up.

08:20.189 --> 08:23.192
If you don't pull your head in,
they will drop you.

08:23.295 --> 08:25.574
Yeah, you
mentioned that.

08:25.677 --> 08:28.749
Stop acting
like a teenager.

08:28.853 --> 08:30.682
If this has got anything
to do with Jessie,

08:30.786 --> 08:34.237
you can talk to me
in confidence.

08:35.894 --> 08:38.069
Do you think
I'm fuckin' her?

08:38.172 --> 08:40.934
Doesn't matter.

08:41.037 --> 08:44.144
Either way, you won't survive
this level of scrutiny.

08:45.766 --> 08:47.423
Scrutiny doesn't bother you,
though, does it?

08:47.527 --> 08:49.529
Yeah, well,
maybe it should.

08:49.632 --> 08:51.289
What do you mean?

08:51.392 --> 08:53.671
You know, I don't know
how he gets away of it.

08:53.774 --> 08:56.087
Smart, strong woman
like you.

08:56.190 --> 08:59.435
I mean, Kath was still a kid
when he married her.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.575
What's your excuse?

09:11.930 --> 09:13.725
Hey.

09:13.829 --> 09:14.899
Well, that's not
a happy face.

09:15.002 --> 09:16.486
Shove it up your
arse, Neil.

09:16.590 --> 09:19.041
Mate, what's up?

09:19.144 --> 09:21.353
Hey?

09:21.457 --> 09:23.632
Brian.
Neil.

09:23.735 --> 09:25.185
Hey.

09:25.288 --> 09:27.083
Are you around
tomorrow morning?

09:27.187 --> 09:29.879
I just want to see you.

09:29.983 --> 09:31.847
Yeah, so do I.

09:31.950 --> 09:34.090
See you at the park
after training.

09:41.132 --> 09:43.237
How'd you go?

09:44.825 --> 09:47.863
Rusty knows.

09:47.966 --> 09:50.003
Knows what?

09:50.106 --> 09:51.521
About us.

09:58.977 --> 10:00.151
Toni:
Are you on today?

10:00.254 --> 10:01.704
Yep.
Not for another hour.

10:01.808 --> 10:03.119
Just wanted
to get in early.

10:03.223 --> 10:05.328
Ooh, lovely.
Aren't you the eager beaver?

10:05.432 --> 10:06.778
Jim:
Why are you limping?

10:06.882 --> 10:08.711
Oh, I'm fine.
Thanks, Jim.

10:08.815 --> 10:10.437
Um, actually...

10:10.540 --> 10:13.371
I, um, I wanted to throw out
an invitation to everyone, um,

10:13.474 --> 10:16.339
to please join me
for a casual drink at my place.

10:16.443 --> 10:17.789
No -- No pressure.Oh.

10:17.893 --> 10:19.204
Oh, when?

10:19.308 --> 10:20.447
Tomorrow after school?

10:20.550 --> 10:22.691
Uh, I'd love to,
but I have a date.

10:22.794 --> 10:25.072
Oh. Well, that sounds
much more exciting.

10:25.176 --> 10:26.729
Actually, I could
cancel it.

10:26.833 --> 10:29.456
Oh, no, no. Thanks.
Please don't.

10:29.559 --> 10:32.321
Is Daniel
going to be there?

10:32.424 --> 10:34.668
Well, he's got training,
so I can't guarantee that.

10:34.772 --> 10:37.706
I'll come back to you.

10:37.809 --> 10:39.431
Not a chance.

10:49.234 --> 10:51.029
Good morning.

10:51.133 --> 10:53.376
What time is it?

10:53.480 --> 10:54.792
I let you sleep in.

10:54.895 --> 10:57.311
So I can't
even go the snooze.

10:58.554 --> 11:01.350
Uh, babe...

11:01.453 --> 11:04.146
I mean, you can snooze.
You've got time.

11:04.249 --> 11:06.182
But do you really want to?

11:06.286 --> 11:09.772
I -- I got three hours of
cardio to do this morning.

11:09.876 --> 11:12.741
Are you fucking serious?

11:12.844 --> 11:15.675
Hey, don't be
like that.

11:19.540 --> 11:21.957
That makes it worse.

11:22.060 --> 11:24.269
Yeah, it might feel worse
before it gets better.

11:24.373 --> 11:26.444
It's just
a light sprain.

11:26.547 --> 11:28.411
Wear this
for a day or two.

11:28.515 --> 11:29.723
Stay away
from the punching bag.

11:31.380 --> 11:33.969
If it gives you any grief,
come back and see me.

11:34.072 --> 11:37.317
Anything else
I can help you with?

11:37.420 --> 11:39.560
Actually, um...

11:39.664 --> 11:42.874
I'm not getting a lot
of social traction.

11:42.978 --> 11:45.497
I-I don't suppose you have
any tips on how to

11:45.601 --> 11:47.776
assimilate with
the other ladies.

11:47.879 --> 11:51.158
Yeah, I don't think my advice
would do you any good.

11:51.262 --> 11:54.334
See, I'm not
a natural fit either.

11:56.094 --> 11:58.131
If this is creepy
and/or just desperate,

11:58.234 --> 12:00.547
let's pretend I never
said it, but, um...

12:00.650 --> 12:02.687
I don't suppose you'd want
to have, like,

12:02.791 --> 12:05.863
a quiet bevvy
with me tomorrow?

12:05.966 --> 12:07.519
Nah, reading you,
it is creepy.

12:07.623 --> 12:09.694
No need to explain.
Uh, so...

12:09.798 --> 12:14.285
Look, if anyone else had asked,
the answer would be no.

12:14.388 --> 12:15.942
So, is that a yes?

12:16.045 --> 12:18.116
I think it is.

12:19.946 --> 12:22.051
You okay?

12:28.678 --> 12:29.852
What's going on?

12:32.337 --> 12:34.926
Called it quits
with Lauren today.

12:35.030 --> 12:36.825
Why?

12:36.928 --> 12:39.862
Was a snap decision.

12:39.966 --> 12:41.830
All the bullshit
they've been throwing

12:41.933 --> 12:43.486
at Jessie and Russ.

12:43.590 --> 12:46.938
If the press got wind
of our situation...

12:47.042 --> 12:48.422
It's not worth the risk.

12:48.526 --> 12:50.666
We've got to pull
the pin on all of it.

12:52.841 --> 12:55.084
Both of us do.

12:59.330 --> 13:02.574
You look a bit
disappointed.

13:02.678 --> 13:04.197
It's not disappointment.You were always gonna break

13:04.300 --> 13:05.785
Adam's heart anyway.

13:05.888 --> 13:07.856
I did that a week ago.

13:07.959 --> 13:11.135
It's surprise.
I'm surprised.

13:11.238 --> 13:13.413
We decided together
to open this marriage.

13:13.516 --> 13:14.828
We did.

13:14.932 --> 13:16.968
And you've made a unilateral
decision to close it.

13:17.072 --> 13:20.627
Oh. It was more of
a reaction than a decision.

13:24.562 --> 13:27.945
Apparently Rusty knows
about Lauren and I.

13:28.048 --> 13:29.843
How did that happen?I don't know.

13:29.947 --> 13:32.604
He spoke to Lauren.

13:32.708 --> 13:36.298
Whatever he said,
it was enough.

13:39.508 --> 13:42.028
I'm sorry about
you and Lauren.

13:42.131 --> 13:43.650
Is she okay?

13:43.753 --> 13:45.790
She wasn't thrilled.

13:47.240 --> 13:49.000
She in better shape
than you?

13:53.349 --> 13:55.075
No question.

14:09.055 --> 14:12.713
So, do you reckon
you could stand it?

14:13.818 --> 14:16.303
Being just
you and me again?

14:19.513 --> 14:21.412
We can try.

14:30.386 --> 14:31.801
Ah!

14:33.527 --> 14:34.735
Yeah!

14:34.839 --> 14:37.152
You got to put
your arms out.

14:37.255 --> 14:39.740
-Airplane!

14:39.844 --> 14:43.261
Aaah!

14:43.365 --> 14:45.919
-You smell seedy.

14:46.023 --> 14:47.576
I haven't been that bad.

14:47.679 --> 14:50.820
Yeah, you have.

14:50.924 --> 14:53.064
Did you read the one
that it's been on for years?

14:53.168 --> 14:55.342
It's not even Jack's kid?Uh-huh.

14:55.446 --> 14:57.517
And what if he was
a little bit older?

14:57.620 --> 14:58.898
Old enough to understand?

14:59.001 --> 15:00.485
He's not, thank God.

15:00.589 --> 15:02.487
Boy: Mommy!

15:02.591 --> 15:06.388
You know, one guy called me
a shameless little slut.

15:10.116 --> 15:12.359
What are you gonna do?

15:12.463 --> 15:15.328
I have no idea.

15:15.431 --> 15:17.330
Who else knows?

15:17.433 --> 15:19.194
Maddy.

15:19.297 --> 15:21.610
I let her believe
it's Jack's.

15:24.544 --> 15:26.063
I'm so sorry.

15:26.166 --> 15:28.134
It's not your fault.

15:28.237 --> 15:31.931
Yeah, well, it's Karlie's fault,
and she's my fault, so...

15:32.034 --> 15:34.105
Wait, Karlie
went to the media?

15:34.209 --> 15:36.142
Yeah, well,
who'd you think it was?

15:36.245 --> 15:37.833
Paige came round
asking questions.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.835
I assu--

15:39.939 --> 15:43.045
I got to call Kath.

15:43.149 --> 15:44.944
Hey, what are you doin'?

15:45.047 --> 15:46.462
The trick is
to break it down.

15:46.566 --> 15:48.361
So if we're looking at
the square root of 2...

15:49.707 --> 15:51.019
...multiplied by
the root of 4...

15:52.330 --> 15:53.711
Okay, now,
we've been over this.

15:53.814 --> 15:55.230
Phones off
when we're working.

15:55.333 --> 15:57.715
It's not just about focus,
it's respect.

15:57.818 --> 16:00.131
Oh, pardon me.

16:00.235 --> 16:01.753
Sorry, I could have sworn
I turned that off.

16:01.857 --> 16:04.549
Is it WAG Central?

16:04.653 --> 16:07.311
As a matter of fact,
it is.

16:07.414 --> 16:09.313
It's the President.

16:11.004 --> 16:12.764
Look at this.
She sprained her ankle.

16:12.868 --> 16:15.698
Oh, it's nothing serious.
I just tried to juggle a snack

16:15.802 --> 16:17.148
with a bit of
light sparring.

16:17.252 --> 16:18.943
We've all done it.

16:19.047 --> 16:23.154
Now
don't feel ambushed,

16:23.258 --> 16:25.294
but we all want to say
something to you.

16:25.398 --> 16:27.779
Yeah.
Collectively.

16:27.883 --> 16:29.816
We owe you an apology.

16:29.919 --> 16:32.370
Especially me.

16:32.474 --> 16:35.339
The whole Rusty affair bomb
hit after you asked me

16:35.442 --> 16:36.926
if anything was
going on between us,

16:37.030 --> 16:40.654
so I assumed you were
the anonymous source.

16:40.758 --> 16:42.346
I was wrong.
It was Karlie.

16:42.449 --> 16:43.795
Course it was.

16:43.899 --> 16:45.314
And I'm really,
really sorry.

16:45.418 --> 16:47.765
Now, we were all way
too quick to judge,

16:47.868 --> 16:50.147
and we want to
make it up to you.

16:50.250 --> 16:51.976
And when Kath's
feeling guilty,

16:52.080 --> 16:53.805
you can pretty much
ask her for anything.

16:53.909 --> 16:55.393
Paige: No, I don't
need anything.

16:55.497 --> 16:56.636
Try again.

16:56.739 --> 16:58.603
Jessie: Seriously. I'd --
I'd go a weekend

16:58.707 --> 16:59.777
at Kath's beach house.Mmm.

16:59.880 --> 17:01.330
Oh, absolutely
welcome any time.

17:01.434 --> 17:03.470
Or Tahlia's
skin magician.

17:03.574 --> 17:05.127
They will make you look
10 years younger

17:05.231 --> 17:07.095
in just
four weeks, guaranteed.

17:07.198 --> 17:08.751
-So I'll look 12.
-Oh, come on, Paige.

17:08.855 --> 17:10.029
Will you please just make us
all feel better

17:10.132 --> 17:14.136
by accepting
our apology bribe, hm?

17:14.240 --> 17:15.586
Okay,
there is one thing.

17:15.689 --> 17:17.139
Great.
Consider it done.

17:17.243 --> 17:19.210
Come have a drink
at my place later.

17:19.314 --> 17:20.418
-Sounds great.
-Today?

17:20.522 --> 17:21.730
Yeah, I could do that.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.801
Hey, can have a bit
of a ladies' soiree.

17:23.904 --> 17:25.596
Awesome.
Lauren's coming, too.

17:25.699 --> 17:28.426
-Oh.
-This is happening.

17:28.530 --> 17:30.635
Andrew: Let's go!

17:32.672 --> 17:34.777
Pick it up, Trav!

17:35.709 --> 17:37.677
Pick it up, Trav!

17:37.780 --> 17:40.128
Come on!

17:40.231 --> 17:43.338
Show these posers
how it's done.

17:57.110 --> 18:00.872
If I can turn up on time to
blow the head honcho,

18:00.976 --> 18:03.565
then so can O'Reilly.

18:03.668 --> 18:06.568
Pull him into line.Yeah, I'm tryin'.

18:06.671 --> 18:08.984
Unh-unh.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.159
Don't try, Brian.

18:11.262 --> 18:13.057
Get it done.

18:20.029 --> 18:23.309
Lauren. Come in, come in.Okay, thank you.

18:23.412 --> 18:24.724
For you.
Oh.

18:26.519 --> 18:27.899
You're taking this home,

18:28.003 --> 18:30.661
'cause we're drinking
Burr Cutters!

18:30.764 --> 18:32.145
-Sounds painful.

18:32.249 --> 18:34.630
It's a Casterton legend.
It'll change your life.

18:34.734 --> 18:36.494
Take a seat.
Take a seat.

18:36.598 --> 18:39.463
How's the ankle?Oh, it's fine.

18:39.566 --> 18:41.396
You're about to taste
heaven in a glass.

18:43.639 --> 18:46.159
Thanks for coming.
This is exactly what I needed.

18:46.263 --> 18:48.920
I've just had a few
too many shitty days lately.

18:49.024 --> 18:51.406
Oh, me too.

18:52.027 --> 18:56.273
-Anything in particular?
-Thank you.

18:56.376 --> 18:58.792
My relationship
ended yesterday.

18:58.896 --> 19:00.449
Oh. I'm so sorry.

19:00.553 --> 19:02.451
I had no idea.Oh, no one did.

19:02.555 --> 19:04.626
I didn't
even see it coming.

19:04.729 --> 19:06.973
How long
were you together?

19:07.076 --> 19:09.148
About 18 months.

19:09.251 --> 19:11.771
Oh, what an asshole.
Mmm...

19:11.874 --> 19:14.325
No.
No, it's complicated.

19:16.845 --> 19:18.433
I invited some of
the other girls,

19:18.536 --> 19:20.745
and it didn't occur to me that
that might be weird for you,

19:20.849 --> 19:22.816
and your face is telling me
that it's weird.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.301
No. No, look, I...

19:24.404 --> 19:25.716
I just thought you said you
weren't really

19:25.819 --> 19:27.269
connecting with them.Yeah, I wasn't,

19:27.373 --> 19:28.926
and they apologized en masse.

19:29.029 --> 19:31.998
It was really confronting.
I'm so sorry.

19:59.612 --> 20:02.062
What are you
trying to prove?

20:03.857 --> 20:06.066
Every time you turn up late,
every fumble,

20:06.170 --> 20:08.655
every single time
you put yourself first...

20:12.003 --> 20:16.422
We're all trying to
get on with it.

20:16.525 --> 20:18.976
But maybe you can get
your head out your arse

20:19.079 --> 20:21.599
and give us a hand?

20:21.703 --> 20:24.430
Eh?

20:24.533 --> 20:26.432
Rusty?!

20:26.535 --> 20:28.365
How did I not know
you were seeing someone?

20:28.468 --> 20:29.676
'Cause I didn't
tell you.

20:29.780 --> 20:31.989
Oh. Thank God.
I thought I'd forgotten.

20:33.404 --> 20:34.681
But why didn't
you tell me?

20:34.785 --> 20:36.580
I didn't tell anyone.

20:36.683 --> 20:39.341
Just try it.Oh, I can't.

20:39.445 --> 20:41.792
Are you intolerant?Sometimes.

20:41.895 --> 20:43.725
It does get easier.

20:50.456 --> 20:53.459
-It's quite nice.
-Yay!

20:53.562 --> 20:54.736
If you want to keep
putting that crap

20:54.839 --> 20:56.393
in your body,
I'm not your mum.

20:56.496 --> 20:58.912
I don't care what you do
on your time.

20:59.016 --> 21:00.431
But if I see that
at the club again...

21:00.535 --> 21:01.881
What are you
gonna do, Trav?

21:01.984 --> 21:04.573
Look, I don't care
how much you hated him.

21:04.677 --> 21:06.195
And no one gives a shit.

21:06.299 --> 21:08.059
Tryin' to hurt
my feelings.

21:08.163 --> 21:09.164
Nah, mate.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.614
I'm saying...

21:10.717 --> 21:14.618
...no one gives a fuck!

21:14.721 --> 21:17.655
Have a bit of respect.

21:17.759 --> 21:19.174
People are
tryin' to mourn.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.832
Oh, is that what
you were tryin' to do?

21:21.935 --> 21:23.592
Yeah, see, I thought
you were using Jack's death

21:23.696 --> 21:27.976
as an excuse to play another
year on your shithouse form.

21:28.079 --> 21:31.082
Yeah.
Pretend to be a hero.

21:35.397 --> 21:36.467
Man: Oh!

21:37.813 --> 21:39.332
Man: Stop!
What are you doin'?!

21:39.436 --> 21:41.679
Man: You all right, mate?I'm all right, I'm all right.

21:41.783 --> 21:42.922
-Get off him!
-Mate, I...

21:43.025 --> 21:45.580
Fuck off!

21:45.683 --> 21:47.547
Man: Boys...

21:47.651 --> 21:49.722
I said I'm right.

21:52.552 --> 21:54.451
Man: Mate...

21:54.554 --> 21:56.038
what's going on?

21:56.142 --> 21:57.799
The more you get out now,

21:57.902 --> 21:59.318
the less you'll have
to purge down the line.

21:59.421 --> 22:00.629
Jessie: Mmm.
You'll feel so much better

22:00.733 --> 22:02.321
if you just focus
on all his negatives.

22:02.424 --> 22:04.323
You don't even
have to participate.

22:04.426 --> 22:06.048
We can tear him apart for you.

22:06.152 --> 22:08.810
-Come in, come in.

22:08.913 --> 22:10.018
Welcome.
Kath: Hi.

22:10.121 --> 22:11.640
Jessie: Hello.Sorry I'm late.

22:11.744 --> 22:13.193
Hey.

22:13.297 --> 22:14.954
We were just about to tear
Lauren's ex a new one.

22:15.057 --> 22:16.542
-Oh.
-Trying to.

22:16.645 --> 22:18.716
She's not helping.

22:18.820 --> 22:21.167
Oh, there must've been
something he did that upset you.

22:21.270 --> 22:23.549
-Pubes in the soap?
-Jocks on the floor?

22:23.652 --> 22:26.552
Did you hate his family?He was kind.

22:26.655 --> 22:28.830
There was
no blame or drama.

22:28.933 --> 22:31.591
We just both
knew it was over.

22:31.695 --> 22:33.835
Oh, bullshit.
Someone got hurt.

22:33.938 --> 22:35.215
Someone always gets hurt.Thank you.

22:35.319 --> 22:36.838
Not necessarily.

22:36.941 --> 22:38.633
I didn't say
I wasn't hurting.

22:38.736 --> 22:40.428
Paige: Well, I'm...
it's his loss.

22:40.531 --> 22:41.981
I mean, look at you.

22:42.084 --> 22:44.708
You're brilliant, you're
upfront, you're smokin' hot.

22:44.811 --> 22:46.710
He's a dumbass.

22:46.813 --> 22:49.575
Had to be said.
To freedom from assholes!

22:49.678 --> 22:52.025
-To freedom from assholes!
-Freedom, sister.

22:57.928 --> 23:00.655
Andrew: The coroner has
confirmed the cause of death.

23:00.758 --> 23:02.622
Just say it.

23:04.935 --> 23:06.937
It was an accident.

23:09.560 --> 23:11.666
What does that mean?

23:11.769 --> 23:14.220
The combination of drugs
in his system,

23:14.323 --> 23:16.118
the knock in the head,

23:16.222 --> 23:20.122
added up to
an unintentional accident.

23:20.226 --> 23:21.572
No crime.

23:21.676 --> 23:24.023
No liability.

23:25.680 --> 23:28.234
Congratulations.

23:31.893 --> 23:35.275
At least you've got a chance
of seeing out your contract.

23:40.004 --> 23:41.730
Tahlia: Well, she's
an absolute idiot.

23:41.834 --> 23:43.352
She wants to keep
this romance a secret,

23:43.456 --> 23:45.665
but then goes and parties
with him the whole night.

23:45.769 --> 23:48.530
At the end of the party,
gets in the same car as him.

23:48.634 --> 23:50.567
They get papped. There we cameras?

23:50.670 --> 23:51.706
Evening, ladies!

23:51.809 --> 23:54.985
-Hey!
-Oh, Dan!

23:55.088 --> 23:56.296
So I've had a couple,

23:56.400 --> 23:58.022
but I think
I'm handling it pretty well.

23:58.126 --> 23:59.886
Oh, look, we should
let you go. Come on.

23:59.990 --> 24:01.163
-Yeah.
-Yep. Yep.

24:01.267 --> 24:02.958
You rest up,
and we'll all go out.

24:03.062 --> 24:05.409
Oh, we don't go out.
Not on a whim.

24:05.513 --> 24:06.893
Uh, what if you
need something?

24:06.997 --> 24:09.206
It's just easier to prevent
social media bombs

24:09.309 --> 24:10.449
and havin' to clean up
afterwards.

24:10.552 --> 24:12.036
Am I right?Yep.

24:12.140 --> 24:13.728
Oh, what if we went to
the sleepy pub near my school?

24:13.831 --> 24:15.108
I've been there
a few times,

24:15.212 --> 24:17.490
and I have seen one
other punter once.

24:17.594 --> 24:19.181
No, not advisable.

24:19.285 --> 24:21.114
You do not know what you're
dealing with with the media.

24:21.218 --> 24:23.047
I mean, you can go from being
a shining role model

24:23.151 --> 24:25.602
to a gold-digging ho
in a single image.

24:25.705 --> 24:27.120
Yeah, but you --

24:27.224 --> 24:28.743
you can't stand out
if there's no-one else there,

24:28.846 --> 24:30.952
and you said I could
have anything I asked for.

24:31.055 --> 24:33.195
Oh.

24:33.299 --> 24:34.921
Okay. A couple
of ground rules upfront, okay?

24:35.025 --> 24:36.854
Number one,
location services turned off.

24:36.958 --> 24:38.200
Actually, just give me
your devices.

24:38.304 --> 24:40.030
Come on. I'll do yours.
Gimme. Thank you.

24:40.133 --> 24:42.377
-I'm going home.
-What? Oh, no!

24:42.481 --> 24:44.172
Okay, rule number two.

24:44.275 --> 24:47.624
There will be a recce carried
out by myself before mass entry.

24:47.727 --> 24:49.142
Rule number three,
I reserve the right

24:49.246 --> 24:51.524
to pull the pin
any time I like.

24:51.628 --> 24:53.699
Am I clear?Clear as rum.

24:53.802 --> 24:55.942
White -- white rum.
That was a joke.

24:56.046 --> 24:57.426
Okay.
Let's go.

24:59.394 --> 25:00.499
What happened to all
your school mates?

25:00.602 --> 25:02.121
Oh, not enough notice,
apparently.

25:02.224 --> 25:03.536
Don't need 'em anyway.

25:03.640 --> 25:05.365
Um, look at you
and all your lady friends.

25:05.469 --> 25:07.367
Go, Scotty!

25:14.685 --> 25:15.755
Oh!

25:15.859 --> 25:17.205
-Hey.
-Hey.

25:17.308 --> 25:18.862
I'll just be two seconds.
There's fresh coffee,

25:18.965 --> 25:20.277
and I made muffins
if you're hungry.

25:20.380 --> 25:21.899
Ooh, what kind of muffins?Double choc.

25:22.003 --> 25:25.144
The kids are sound asleep.
I read them four stories.

25:25.247 --> 25:27.422
That ghost book of Abi's
is terrifying.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.113
I'm just halfway through
this final e-mail,

25:29.217 --> 25:31.046
then all I've got to do is...Mads?

25:31.150 --> 25:32.496
Yeah?

25:32.600 --> 25:33.601
Take a breath, babe.

25:33.704 --> 25:35.119
Oh.

25:35.223 --> 25:36.396
Go again.

25:36.500 --> 25:38.157
I wasn't breathing.

25:38.260 --> 25:40.435
Uh, take
another one, then.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.575
Ooh.

25:42.679 --> 25:44.197
What's, uh...

25:44.301 --> 25:46.027
what's goin' on?

25:46.130 --> 25:48.754
I've got a lot
of work done.

25:48.857 --> 25:51.342
I scored a little bit of pseudo
from Gavin at the pharmacy.

25:51.446 --> 25:52.689
I told him it was for you.

25:52.792 --> 25:55.036
You are unbelievable.

25:55.139 --> 25:56.589
Oh, sorry.
I'll fess up tomorrow

25:56.693 --> 25:57.832
when I go
and pick up the nit cream.

25:57.935 --> 25:59.143
Gavin knew it was
for me anyway.

25:59.247 --> 26:01.180
No. It's not that.
After all the shit

26:01.283 --> 26:02.940
you give me
about all the stuff I take...

26:03.044 --> 26:04.942
Look, I don't do it
for a pick-me-up

26:05.046 --> 26:06.116
or 'cause I'm tired.

26:06.219 --> 26:08.187
I do it
so I can do my job.

26:08.290 --> 26:10.396
What the fuck do you think
I'mtryin' to do?!

26:10.499 --> 26:11.984
I've got all the help
I can possibly get,

26:12.087 --> 26:14.538
and I'm still just being
eaten alive by the hours here!

26:14.642 --> 26:16.644
The kids are fine.

26:16.747 --> 26:18.611
I'm fine.

26:18.715 --> 26:20.682
You'll work out how
to make it happen.

26:20.786 --> 26:22.857
All right?

26:22.960 --> 26:24.755
Fuck!
Oh, babe!

26:24.859 --> 26:25.963
Why are you limping?

26:26.067 --> 26:28.310
Uh...

26:28.414 --> 26:29.864
I'm gonna miss
a few weeks.

26:29.967 --> 26:32.349
Oh.I've done my calf again.

26:32.452 --> 26:33.764
Why don't you go have
a lay down?

26:33.868 --> 26:35.421
No. No part of me
wants to rest right now.

26:35.524 --> 26:36.940
Not even my eyes.

26:37.043 --> 26:39.908
Well, what would
you like to do?

27:06.832 --> 27:07.729
This could take
a while.

27:07.833 --> 27:09.593
How many levels?Just one.

27:12.251 --> 27:13.873
Does she always
do this?

27:13.977 --> 27:17.739
Once we had to wait 40 minutes
before we got the all clear.

27:17.843 --> 27:20.052
I think we're
gonna be fine.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.367
What did I tell you?

27:25.471 --> 27:26.817
No one even looks you
in the eye.

27:26.921 --> 27:29.026
You can't even get
reception in here.

27:29.130 --> 27:32.098
I don't think those
two gentlemen care.

27:32.202 --> 27:34.791
It's like they're asleep
with their eyes open.

27:36.551 --> 27:40.555
Hi. Do you know how to make
a Burr Cutter?

27:41.004 --> 27:42.695
I need O'Reilly
on the ground this week.

27:42.799 --> 27:43.869
Mnh-mnh.

27:43.972 --> 27:45.664
Look, I know
he's been out of control.

27:45.767 --> 27:46.872
I'm not disputing that.

27:46.975 --> 27:48.701
You have to
rein him in now,

27:48.805 --> 27:50.392
or he will
self-destruct.

27:50.496 --> 27:51.704
That's exactly what
I've been saying to you

27:51.808 --> 27:53.188
for the last four weeks.

27:53.292 --> 27:56.329
Well, if it was your idea
in the first place,

27:56.433 --> 27:57.745
what's the problem?

27:57.848 --> 28:00.230
The problem is
I need him now.

28:00.333 --> 28:02.335
I cannot get us across
the line without him.

28:02.439 --> 28:05.373
Wrong answer.
Find a way.

28:05.476 --> 28:07.064
Travis threw
the first punch.

28:07.168 --> 28:08.514
I don't care.

28:08.617 --> 28:10.723
He crossed the line.
He injured another player.

28:10.827 --> 28:13.139
Trav injured himself.

28:13.243 --> 28:15.521
He's not listening
to you, Brian.

28:15.624 --> 28:18.904
And he's not
playing this week.

28:19.007 --> 28:20.491
Now...

28:20.595 --> 28:23.080
shall we have
a little dessert?

of a Burr Cutter?

28:44.792 --> 28:46.655
Ooh, is it some sort of weapon
associated with harvesting?

28:46.759 --> 28:48.278
It's much worse
than that.

28:48.381 --> 28:50.280

Spent most of my time watching
TV while she was working.

31:31.337 --> 31:33.443
I learned to spell by watching
"Wheel of Fortune."

31:49.838 --> 31:51.185
Cute!

31:51.288 --> 31:54.050
Okay. Obviously I should

31:54.153 --> 31:55.810
but I don't want

33:02.463 --> 33:04.430
Look, I'd prefer to be
in your bed

33:04.534 --> 33:06.260
I'm just waiting
for the invitation.

33:16.960 --> 33:19.273
I'm gonna have a bath.

33:37.498 --> 33:39.327
Just drive.

33:39.431 --> 33:40.708
Fucking hell!

34:09.530 --> 34:13.223
Travis: That's a nice shiner
you got there.

34:13.327 --> 34:15.812
Brings out the color
in your eyes.

34:18.228 --> 34:20.161
They're calling it
an accident.

34:20.265 --> 34:23.785
Neil told me,
officially, now.

34:25.373 --> 34:27.065
He was taking pills.

34:29.584 --> 34:31.931
Prescription meds,
but more than what

34:32.035 --> 34:34.969
he was supposed to have.

34:35.073 --> 34:37.040
Apparently.

34:37.730 --> 34:39.215
They told me to to go to ground

34:39.318 --> 34:42.149
when Jessie was being slammed
by the media...

34:42.252 --> 34:43.702
about me.

34:43.805 --> 34:48.810
No comment, no denial,
no acknowledgement at all.

34:48.914 --> 34:50.950
Said I'd just fan the flames"

34:54.161 --> 34:56.956
She means more to me
than I could ever explain,

34:57.060 --> 34:59.373
and I shouldn't have to.

35:02.790 --> 35:04.895
I mean, she made
my life easier

35:04.999 --> 35:07.208
when she could
have blown it up.

35:08.796 --> 35:10.901
It's as simple as that.

35:11.005 --> 35:13.870
And now she's lost Jack.

35:13.973 --> 35:20.048
She has this
carbon copy of him

35:20.152 --> 35:22.499
asking her where he is.

35:22.603 --> 35:23.845
The whole world's
got an opinion,

35:23.949 --> 35:26.365
and I can't go
anywhere near her.

35:26.469 --> 35:29.644
I can't help out with JJ.
I can't do anything at all.

35:32.164 --> 35:35.650
Because Karlie said
we were fucking around.

35:35.754 --> 35:37.445
Uh...

35:39.344 --> 35:41.415
Here.

35:45.522 --> 35:46.627
You know you could've
brought these out

35:46.730 --> 35:48.007
when you first got here.

35:49.802 --> 35:53.703
I was hoping not
to be here that long.

35:59.674 --> 36:04.783
Hey, look, I know it's really
late, and I'm sorry, but...

36:04.886 --> 36:07.165
do you want to come stay
with JJ tonight?

36:07.268 --> 36:09.408
I will pay you double.

36:11.617 --> 36:17.175
-You okay?
-Not in any meaningful way, no.

36:18.624 --> 36:20.247
What the fuck is
going on, Connor?

36:20.350 --> 36:24.251
I don't know.
Look, I -- I can't focus.

36:24.354 --> 36:25.907
I'm not sleeping, I'm...

36:26.011 --> 36:28.600
I'm trying to pretend that
everything's okay, but it's not.

36:28.703 --> 36:30.740
That has nothing
to do with us.

36:30.843 --> 36:33.329
What if it does?It's about you and Tahlia.

36:33.432 --> 36:35.054
We owe it to
ourselves,

36:35.158 --> 36:38.023
and more importantly to
Tahlia, and to Brian,

36:38.126 --> 36:40.957
to just walk away
from this.

36:42.683 --> 36:44.340
Yeah, agreed.

36:46.514 --> 36:48.620
I want to be
very clear.

36:48.723 --> 36:52.417
I think you are
a very talented young man.

36:56.524 --> 36:59.769
And I think you are
an incredibly beautiful woman.

36:59.872 --> 37:01.426
No!
No words from you.

37:01.529 --> 37:03.566
Don't speak.

37:06.293 --> 37:10.366
Okay, maybe you can just say
one thing, but quick.

37:10.469 --> 37:13.023
I don't want to stop.

37:13.127 --> 37:15.888
But I know -- I know
we should, but...

37:15.992 --> 37:18.684
I really don't want to.

37:21.308 --> 37:23.102
Right, here's what
we're gonna do, okay?

37:23.206 --> 37:24.794
You're gonna
drive me home.

37:24.897 --> 37:27.210
We are never gonna talk about
this, ever again,

37:27.314 --> 37:28.453
and we...

37:40.361 --> 37:45.953
I feel like I am breathing
through my eyes now.

37:47.920 --> 37:52.580
Rusty told me Jack had drugs in
his system when he died.

37:52.684 --> 37:54.410
What kind of drugs?

37:54.513 --> 37:55.963
Antidepressants.

37:57.723 --> 38:00.795
That makes sense given
everything he'd been through.

38:00.899 --> 38:02.038
And oxy.

38:02.141 --> 38:03.453
Like you take?

38:03.557 --> 38:05.248
Mmm.

38:05.352 --> 38:07.319
And Xanax.

38:09.390 --> 38:12.359
Your Xanax.

38:12.462 --> 38:15.258
I gave him a few of yours
and a few of mine.

38:19.469 --> 38:21.540
You didn't think to tell me
about this before now?

38:21.644 --> 38:23.784
Well, it was ages ago.
I...

38:23.887 --> 38:28.167
Didn't really occur to me until
Rusty brought it up tonight.

39:13.212 --> 39:15.042
Hey.

39:15.145 --> 39:18.563
Hey.

39:19.529 --> 39:21.773
Do you ever
think about...

39:21.876 --> 39:24.223
why we started
seeing other people

39:24.327 --> 39:26.156
in the first place?

39:27.848 --> 39:30.989
Not as much
as I used to.

39:31.092 --> 39:34.510
Not since it started
making sense.

39:34.613 --> 39:37.375
Yeah, it did make sense.

39:37.478 --> 39:39.791
We made it work,
didn't we?

39:39.894 --> 39:42.103
I think so.

39:44.520 --> 39:47.315
Do you think you and I
can work without it?

39:54.633 --> 39:58.050
The way I feel about you
has never wavered.

39:59.569 --> 40:02.986
It's all still
right here for me.

40:03.090 --> 40:05.541
It always has been.

40:08.820 --> 40:11.754
Question is...

40:11.857 --> 40:14.377
where are you?

40:16.310 --> 40:18.761
I'm pretty sure
I'm right here.

40:36.848 --> 40:38.919
-Nate.
-Hey.

40:45.201 --> 40:47.341
Oh, God,
I missed you.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.757
I missed you, too.

40:59.318 --> 41:02.321
I'm glad you called!

41:02.425 --> 41:05.083
Rusty!

41:05.186 --> 41:06.567
I can't hear you!

41:06.671 --> 41:08.673
I just said
I'm glad you called.

41:08.776 --> 41:10.502
I still can't hear you!

41:10.606 --> 41:11.745
I said --

41:11.848 --> 41:15.507
You're gonna have
to get closer!

41:33.111 --> 41:34.250
Didn't think you'd show.

41:34.353 --> 41:36.873
Yeah, well,
neither did I.

41:36.977 --> 41:39.048
I didn't think you'd
get in the water.

41:39.151 --> 41:41.188
Well, it's not too late
to change your mind.

41:41.291 --> 41:43.190
You gonna
record me, or...

41:43.293 --> 41:44.294
Yeah, that's usually
how it works.

41:44.398 --> 41:46.434
Yeah, well,
get on with it.

41:46.538 --> 41:49.955
Whenever you're ready.

41:50.059 --> 41:51.923
I'm not having an affair
with Jessie Davies

41:52.026 --> 41:55.133
or any other woman

41:55.236 --> 42:01.657
because...

42:01.760 --> 42:04.798
I'm not attracted
to women...

42:04.901 --> 42:07.076
sexually.

42:07.179 --> 42:09.319
Sorry, yeah,
just to clarify.

42:09.423 --> 42:11.114
You're saying...

42:11.218 --> 42:12.840
I'm gay.

42:16.568 --> 42:19.571
Now, leave
Jessie Davies alone.
