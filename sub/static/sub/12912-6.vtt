00:37.420 --> 00:38.980

00:44.900 --> 00:48.460

01:05.620 --> 01:06.900
Chris! What's going on?

01:06.980 --> 01:08.860
There's a pod of dolphins
beached up the coast.

01:08.940 --> 01:10.980
One was too weak to send back
out so we brought her here.

01:11.060 --> 01:12.700
Will she be all right?

01:12.780 --> 01:14.940
The vet's going to do an assessment
once we've finished the rescue.

01:15.020 --> 01:16.580
I've got to get back out there,
there's dozens of them.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.140
Hey, Chris, you ready to go?

01:18.220 --> 01:20.060
Yeah, I got all the extra
equipment you requested.

01:20.140 --> 01:21.300
I'll give you a hand.

01:21.380 --> 01:22.780
No, look, I need you
to hold the fort here.

01:22.860 --> 01:24.540
Just keep an eye on that
sick dolphin for us.

01:24.620 --> 01:26.580
I think I'll be more help out there.
-I'm sorry, Karl.

01:26.660 --> 01:28.260
We're short staffed.
We need you here.

01:28.340 --> 01:29.500
What about Mimmi?
She could give Karl a hand.

01:29.580 --> 01:30.660
Me?

01:31.220 --> 01:33.860
Look, you don't mind leaving your toy
cart for a little while, do you, Mimmi?

01:33.940 --> 01:35.060
I... I guess not.

01:35.140 --> 01:37.460
Terrific.
Just do what Karl says.

01:37.540 --> 01:38.780
Okay, let's go.

01:48.060 --> 01:49.380
Hey.
-Hey.

01:50.420 --> 01:51.980
I can't stay.

01:52.060 --> 01:53.980
Ondina's giving me
a moon ring lesson.

01:54.060 --> 01:55.100
Another one?

01:55.180 --> 01:57.940
She says a few more lessons
and I'll be a moon ring expert.

02:01.620 --> 02:02.620
What?

02:03.540 --> 02:05.940
Nothing... Nothing, I...
I'm sure she's right.

02:12.540 --> 02:15.340
I have to learn how to use this,
Zac.

02:15.420 --> 02:17.780
Getting a moon ring was the
greatest honor of my life.

02:17.860 --> 02:19.740
I don't want to waste it.

02:19.820 --> 02:21.180
I know. I know.

02:21.260 --> 02:22.860
It's just...

02:22.940 --> 02:25.620
It might take more
than a few lessons...

02:25.700 --> 02:28.180
especially with Ondina.
-Ondina's a great teacher.

02:28.260 --> 02:29.820
She said so herself, right?

02:33.140 --> 02:34.620
She wants to teach me.

02:36.900 --> 02:40.100
Just be careful, okay, because
these things pack a punch.

02:40.180 --> 02:42.500
And I don't want you
turning into a frog by accident.

02:42.580 --> 02:45.180
Would you rather
I turn into a frog on purpose?

02:50.580 --> 02:51.660
Do you want something to eat?

02:51.740 --> 02:52.980
I can't.

02:54.420 --> 02:56.020
We can catch up later.

02:57.860 --> 03:00.340
Don't wanna risk
upsetting the teacher.

03:00.420 --> 03:02.940
I wanna hear all about it.

03:05.380 --> 03:10.140
Project the energy of the moon
ring into the object... and return.

03:13.420 --> 03:15.060
I can already do that.

03:15.140 --> 03:16.580
A little revision doesn't hurt.

03:16.660 --> 03:19.460
Well, I was hoping we could try
something a little more challenging.

03:19.540 --> 03:21.820
Are you sure you're ready?
After last time?

03:21.900 --> 03:24.980
I made a mistake.
It won't happen again.

03:25.060 --> 03:27.180
Moon rings are dangerous
without proper training.

03:27.260 --> 03:28.980
She's lucky you're here then.

03:29.060 --> 03:31.980
It would be irresponsible of me
to push you too hard.

03:32.060 --> 03:34.620
Makes it easier for Ondina, too.
-Excuse me?

03:34.700 --> 03:36.260
If you stick to the basics,

03:36.340 --> 03:38.140
there's less chance
you'll embarrass yourself.

03:38.660 --> 03:42.500
I would have no problem teaching Evie
the most difficult moon ring magic...

03:42.580 --> 03:43.860
if she was ready.

03:43.940 --> 03:46.100
I am.

03:46.180 --> 03:47.820
I promise.

03:48.860 --> 03:49.900
Fine.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.860
Let's move on from
basic levitation.

03:56.060 --> 03:57.580
The principle is the same.

03:58.620 --> 04:01.380
Project the moon ring power
into the object...

04:05.460 --> 04:06.620
and let it do the rest.

04:08.380 --> 04:09.740
Wow.

04:09.820 --> 04:10.980
That's cool.

04:11.900 --> 04:14.100
You never know when you'll need
to lift underwater boulders

04:14.180 --> 04:16.019
or help stranded sailors.

04:16.100 --> 04:18.500
When have you ever helped
a stranded sailor?

04:18.579 --> 04:21.500
There are plenty of other places
you could hang out.

04:21.579 --> 04:23.100
I might have a moon
ring myself one day.

04:23.580 --> 04:25.980
I'm staying to watch
the great teacher at work.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.380
Your turn.

04:37.460 --> 04:40.260
First of all,
you'll need a wetsuit.

04:40.340 --> 04:41.380
For what?

04:41.460 --> 04:43.380
I need you to clean the pool.

04:43.460 --> 04:45.500
You want me to get
into the water?

04:45.580 --> 04:47.220
You can swim, can't you?

04:47.300 --> 04:48.580
Uh... yeah.

04:48.660 --> 04:51.180
Can't we just leave
them in the water?

04:51.260 --> 04:52.580
No, we can't.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.980
They go in that barrel...
I'll help.

04:55.060 --> 04:57.220
Actually...
I'll be fine on my own.

04:57.300 --> 04:59.300
You must have
other things to do.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.740
I'll go check on
the sick dolphin.

05:02.700 --> 05:03.980
I'll see you later.

05:09.420 --> 05:10.460
Good.

05:10.540 --> 05:13.220
Stay focused. You're doing fine.

05:16.860 --> 05:19.220
Now, slowly move your hand away.

05:21.060 --> 05:23.060
I did it.

05:23.140 --> 05:25.420
Excellent work.

05:29.060 --> 05:31.340
Uh-oh.
-Don't worry.

05:31.420 --> 05:32.660
Ah, it's falling!

05:32.740 --> 05:34.220
Use the moon ring again.

05:37.180 --> 05:39.260
It's not working.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.100
Concentrate!

05:41.180 --> 05:43.300
Show it who's boss.

05:52.660 --> 05:53.900
What's happening?

05:53.980 --> 05:55.740
Um...

05:55.820 --> 05:59.020
Well, I would say
that you've made progress.

06:30.900 --> 06:32.140
Ondina, I'm so sorry.

06:32.220 --> 06:33.620
It's okay. It's okay.

06:33.700 --> 06:35.540
Just bring me down.
-Okay.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.500
Good effort, Evie.
Um, let's... let's try it again.

06:48.380 --> 06:49.540
I can't do this!

06:49.620 --> 06:50.900
Yes, you can.

06:50.980 --> 06:52.460
I don't know how!

06:53.820 --> 06:56.100
I'm so glad I stayed.

06:59.340 --> 07:01.500
Hey, girl. How are you doing?

07:03.020 --> 07:05.020
I wish I could understand you.

07:21.380 --> 07:23.780
What are you doing here?
-I finished at the pool.

07:25.300 --> 07:26.620
What's wrong with her?

07:27.620 --> 07:29.500
No idea.

07:30.580 --> 07:33.700
Why is she bumping the gate
to the next pool?

07:33.780 --> 07:36.540
She must be stressed.
-Oh, I think it's more than that.

07:37.820 --> 07:40.220
We can't do anything
until the vet arrives.

07:42.580 --> 07:43.740
The school group's here.

07:44.860 --> 07:46.340
You can help me make sure
no one wanders off.

07:54.980 --> 07:57.700
If you can't get down, we could
always use you as a chandelier.

07:59.340 --> 08:02.140
Keep calm.
Focus the power of the ring.

08:02.220 --> 08:03.780
I can't do it.

08:03.860 --> 08:05.260
Take a breath and try again.

08:05.340 --> 08:06.740
I don't want to!

08:06.820 --> 08:08.300
Allow me to help.

08:11.140 --> 08:12.900
Argh! What was that?

08:14.060 --> 08:16.980
Whoa!

08:17.060 --> 08:18.980
Thanks for the help.

08:19.060 --> 08:21.380
I'm so sorry.
-Forget sorry! Get us down!

08:29.780 --> 08:31.420
Killer sharks!

08:31.500 --> 08:32.860
Which one swims the fastest?

08:32.940 --> 08:34.059
The shortfin mako.

08:34.140 --> 08:37.659
And it may surprise you to know
not all sharks are killers.

08:37.740 --> 08:42.419
Some sharks can be dangerous, but
most are no threat to humans...

08:42.500 --> 08:43.659
as long as we respect them.

08:43.740 --> 08:46.060
So, can you play with them,
like dolphins?

08:47.180 --> 08:48.780
Sharks are top-level predators.

08:49.620 --> 08:52.700
Cool.
-The point is, they're not toys.

08:52.780 --> 08:56.940
Actually, some sharks can be very
playful, once you get to know them.

08:57.020 --> 08:58.180
Really?

08:58.260 --> 09:00.980
Sometimes sharks race
each other, just for fun.

09:03.380 --> 09:06.780
Why don't you guys see how many
types of fish you can identify?

09:06.860 --> 09:08.580
Mimmi? Can I have a word?

09:12.980 --> 09:15.740
Sharks race each other? Are you
trying to make me look stupid?

09:15.820 --> 09:17.020
It's true.

09:17.100 --> 09:18.980
There's years of research
behind that theory, is there?

09:19.060 --> 09:20.900
Plenty of documented proof?

09:20.980 --> 09:22.100
Not exactly.

09:22.180 --> 09:25.660
Here at the Marine Park, we
deal in proven scientific fact.

09:25.740 --> 09:28.620
Look, I was only trying to help.
-You want to help?

09:28.700 --> 09:29.780
Fine. Come on.

09:42.180 --> 09:44.580
All you need to do
is hand feed them.

09:44.660 --> 09:46.500
Do you think you
can manage that?

09:48.060 --> 09:50.540
Do you have any rubber gloves?

09:50.620 --> 09:52.380
Have you caught
a whiff of those?

09:52.460 --> 09:55.060
Okay, gloves. Anything else?

10:07.860 --> 10:11.980
Sorry,
I don't speak Southern Penguin,

10:12.060 --> 10:14.540
but do any of you
speak Northern Penguin?

10:17.660 --> 10:19.380
Whoa!

10:19.460 --> 10:21.020
Ah, wrong way.
I said down, not up!

10:21.100 --> 10:24.100
Stop yelling at me.
I'm doing my best!

10:24.180 --> 10:26.100
Oh! This... this is hopeless.

10:26.180 --> 10:27.580
I'll get Mimmi.
-No, Evie--

10:27.660 --> 10:28.780
She'll know what to do.

10:28.860 --> 10:29.940
Evie! No!

10:30.020 --> 10:31.380
No, Evie! Evie!

10:31.460 --> 10:32.500
Stop!

10:32.580 --> 10:35.180
Evie, stay with us! Evie!

10:39.100 --> 10:42.300
What if Mimmi can't get us down?
-She won't have to. I will.

10:43.020 --> 10:44.020
How?

10:44.100 --> 10:46.580
I'm thinking. Don't interrupt.

10:46.660 --> 10:48.860
Sure, I... I'll leave you alone.

10:48.940 --> 10:51.540
Oh, wait, I can't because I'm
floating six feet off the ground.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.140
Good, huh?

10:57.220 --> 10:59.260
Sardines are my favorite, too.

10:59.340 --> 11:01.780
Come on,
get it while it's fresh.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.380
Here you go, eat up.

11:10.620 --> 11:13.340
Oh, no, I don't think so.

11:13.420 --> 11:16.620
You've already been back
for seconds... and thirds.

11:17.340 --> 11:19.340
And you thought I
wasn't counting.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.620
That poor dolphin
doesn't sound good.

11:36.020 --> 11:37.380
Mimmi?

11:38.220 --> 11:39.660
Where are you going?

11:41.180 --> 11:42.980
I think the dolphin's in pain.

11:43.060 --> 11:44.300
The dolphin's not your problem.

11:44.380 --> 11:46.900
Come on, the penguins
won't feed themselves.

11:54.220 --> 11:56.700
Can't you use your moon ring
to get us down?

11:56.780 --> 11:58.540
I asked you not to interrupt.

12:04.380 --> 12:05.380
Got it.

12:05.460 --> 12:06.860
Finally. What?

12:06.940 --> 12:08.620
Evie over-energized us.

12:08.700 --> 12:10.740
All we need to do
is neutralize the energy.

12:11.420 --> 12:13.020
Of course.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.300
It's so obvious.

12:14.380 --> 12:16.220
Why didn't I think of that?

12:16.300 --> 12:19.260
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

12:19.340 --> 12:20.940
I zap you with my moon ring.

12:21.020 --> 12:22.660
You zap me with Evie's.

12:22.740 --> 12:25.020
The two forces will
cancel each other out.

12:25.100 --> 12:26.380
Slight problem.
-Mmm?

12:26.460 --> 12:30.420
Evie's moon ring is down there.
We're... up here.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.820
Easily fixed.

12:31.900 --> 12:33.500
I'll make it come to me.

12:35.340 --> 12:36.500
Oh.

12:42.900 --> 12:44.020
You meant to do that, right?

12:45.500 --> 12:47.100
Ondina, talk to me!

12:47.860 --> 12:50.220
It should have come to me.

12:50.300 --> 12:52.580
Evie's moon ring must have
messed with my magic.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.980
Let me try.

13:18.820 --> 13:21.340
Hey, Evie.
-Have you seen Mimmi?

13:22.580 --> 13:24.180
I'm good. How are you?

13:24.260 --> 13:25.940
Sorry. It's an emergency.

13:26.020 --> 13:27.540
An emergency, hey?

13:27.620 --> 13:29.020
Luckily for you,
the Camster is here.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.580
What do you need me to do?

13:30.660 --> 13:32.220
Mimmi hasn't been in today.

13:32.300 --> 13:34.900
Maybe she's at work?
-Of course.

13:36.340 --> 13:37.660
You're welcome.

13:37.740 --> 13:39.180
Always happy to help.

13:50.540 --> 13:53.060
Sorry, guys. Kitchen's closed.

13:59.060 --> 14:00.660
Hey, girl.

14:00.740 --> 14:01.900
I know you're in pain,

14:01.980 --> 14:03.780
but I can't help you
unless you tell me where.

14:07.100 --> 14:08.500
Oh, what does "all over" mean?

14:24.060 --> 14:25.220
Mimmi?

14:37.860 --> 14:40.580
What's the problem?

14:40.660 --> 14:44.260
Can you tell me where it hurts?

14:46.420 --> 14:48.140
You're kidding!

14:49.020 --> 14:50.620
What? Right now?

15:04.300 --> 15:05.660
You try!

15:05.740 --> 15:07.460
Okay.

15:15.140 --> 15:16.860
It's no use.

15:16.940 --> 15:18.660
Why don't we wait
until Mimmi gets back?

15:18.740 --> 15:19.980
She's at work.

15:20.060 --> 15:21.460
She won't be back for hours.
We...

15:21.540 --> 15:23.260
we have to keep trying.

15:23.340 --> 15:25.580
Even if we get the moon ring,
I can't use it.

15:25.660 --> 15:26.820
Always with the negative.

15:26.900 --> 15:30.380
You're the one who goes on and on
about how hard they are to master

15:30.460 --> 15:32.980
and how dangerous they can be
if you're not properly trained.

15:33.980 --> 15:36.260
I may have exaggerated.

15:38.420 --> 15:39.820
They're still dangerous.

15:39.900 --> 15:41.860
You'll be fine.

15:41.940 --> 15:43.500
I'll give you a crash course.

15:43.580 --> 15:46.260
See... that's the part
I'm worried about.

15:48.540 --> 15:49.820
Karl!

15:49.900 --> 15:52.060
You can't just walk off the job,
Mimmi! Where were you?

15:52.140 --> 15:53.300
At the dolphin pool.

15:53.380 --> 15:54.940
I told you,
the dolphin's not your problem.

15:55.020 --> 15:57.140
She's pregnant!
-What?

15:57.220 --> 15:59.700
But she's not in full term,
she's in premature labor!

16:00.460 --> 16:02.780
Where are you getting this from?
There's no way you could know that.

16:02.860 --> 16:04.380
Please. You have to believe me.

16:04.460 --> 16:06.740
Like I had to believe that
sharks hold swimming carnivals?

16:06.820 --> 16:07.820
No. Listen--

16:07.900 --> 16:11.140
Mimmi, you've made it very clear
you aren't interested in helping.

16:11.220 --> 16:14.700
So, you go back to your toy cart
and let me get on with it.

16:15.540 --> 16:18.620
I get that you don't like me, and I
get that you think I know nothing,

16:18.700 --> 16:19.980
but what if I am right?

16:20.060 --> 16:22.260
And what if there's a problem
with the birth?

16:22.340 --> 16:24.260
Can you afford to
take that risk?

16:26.140 --> 16:27.460
Get your foot out of my face!

16:27.540 --> 16:29.340
Hang on.
I'm getting into position.

16:31.860 --> 16:33.900
I think I can reach it!

16:42.540 --> 16:44.340
Nice show.
You should join the circus.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.820
Okay. Give me a push.

16:49.540 --> 16:51.500
You're gonna show me how it's done?
-Probably.

17:05.700 --> 17:07.819
No, no, no, no, no!

17:11.420 --> 17:14.420
Go on. Say it.
-What?

17:14.500 --> 17:17.099
You never miss a chance
to rub it in my face.

17:17.180 --> 17:19.619
I'm sure you're thinking up
some biting one-liner.

17:19.700 --> 17:24.180
Actually, I was thinking it's kind
of cool how hard you keep trying,

17:24.260 --> 17:26.700
even though the situation
is clearly hopeless.

17:27.740 --> 17:29.700
Oh... thanks.

17:29.780 --> 17:30.780
Don't mention it.

17:36.900 --> 17:38.220
Mimmi?

17:41.860 --> 17:44.060
I guess she does look
a little swollen.

17:45.140 --> 17:47.780
The dolphin in the next pool,
does she have a baby?

17:47.860 --> 17:50.300
Yeah. Heidi calved last summer.

17:50.380 --> 17:52.820
Well, dolphins like to be with
other moms when they give birth.

17:52.900 --> 17:55.180
That's why she's been
bumping the gate.

17:56.620 --> 17:57.700
Could be.

17:58.420 --> 18:01.020
Let her through, Karl. Please.

18:01.100 --> 18:03.220
She needs to be with the others.

18:03.300 --> 18:04.700
Please.

18:04.780 --> 18:06.780
I'm not authorized.
We should wait for Dr. Ross.

18:06.860 --> 18:07.980
It might be too late.

18:09.740 --> 18:10.940
Okay.

18:40.020 --> 18:42.060
Hey! How did the rescue go?

18:42.140 --> 18:44.300
Good. We got the rest of the pod
back out to sea.

18:44.380 --> 18:45.820
That's fantastic news.

18:45.900 --> 18:47.580
And how are things here?
Any problems?

18:47.660 --> 18:49.380
Uh... not exactly.

18:49.460 --> 18:51.660
That dolphin that you
brought in, she wasn't sick.

18:51.740 --> 18:53.980
She was in premature labor.
-What?

18:55.180 --> 18:59.020
I knew it was a risk, but I opened
the gate and let her join Heidi.

18:59.100 --> 19:00.260
And it turned out fine.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.860
Heidi gave her
all the help she needed,

19:02.940 --> 19:05.900
and now we've got
a new female baby calf.

19:05.980 --> 19:07.540
Well, I'm impressed.

19:08.140 --> 19:10.340
I'll go check on them.
Well done, Karl.

19:10.420 --> 19:12.620
Actually, it was--
-Mimmi!

19:14.180 --> 19:15.780
I need you right now!

19:16.700 --> 19:17.860
Do you mind if I...

19:17.940 --> 19:19.260
It's cool. You've earned it.

19:21.540 --> 19:22.940
I guess I had her figured wrong.

19:23.020 --> 19:26.460
For a girl who works at the toy
cart... she knows an awful lot.

19:26.540 --> 19:27.700
What do you mean?

19:27.780 --> 19:30.500
She was the one who knew the
dolphin was pregnant and in labor.

19:30.580 --> 19:32.300
Not me. It was her call.

19:32.380 --> 19:33.620
Really?

19:33.700 --> 19:35.140
How?

19:35.220 --> 19:37.220
I was gonna ask you
the same question.

19:39.140 --> 19:41.660
Almost there... almost.

19:41.740 --> 19:44.820
When was the last time
you changed your socks?

19:46.620 --> 19:48.860
Okay. A little... further.

19:49.820 --> 19:51.340
A little lower.

19:54.860 --> 19:55.980
Ah, got it!

19:59.180 --> 20:00.460
Good work.
-You too.

20:00.540 --> 20:02.620
Now what?
-Put it on.

20:06.660 --> 20:10.700
We need to bring our moon rings
together at exactly the same time,

20:10.780 --> 20:13.260
and focus our energy
on each other.

20:13.780 --> 20:14.780
Okay.

20:14.860 --> 20:16.380
I'll count to three.

20:17.540 --> 20:20.740
One... two--

20:20.820 --> 20:24.020
Wait! Are we going on three
or after three?

20:24.620 --> 20:27.100
On three.
-Right. Got it.

20:27.940 --> 20:30.940
One... two--

20:31.020 --> 20:32.500
Wait!

20:32.580 --> 20:34.780
If this doesn't turn out...

20:34.860 --> 20:37.580
I just want you to know that...
you're okay.

20:38.580 --> 20:39.820
Mostly.

20:39.900 --> 20:41.460
Gee, thanks.

20:41.540 --> 20:42.980
You're mostly okay, too...

20:43.060 --> 20:45.340
when you're not interrupting me.

20:45.420 --> 20:46.540
Can we go now?

20:50.460 --> 20:53.700
One... two... three.

21:07.180 --> 21:08.380
Are you okay?

21:08.460 --> 21:09.900
I heard a crash.

21:09.980 --> 21:11.020
Evie said you guys
had a problem.

21:11.100 --> 21:13.900
Does it look like
we have a problem, Weilan?

21:13.980 --> 21:15.780
No. No problem here.

21:24.900 --> 21:26.980
How... did it go?

21:28.340 --> 21:30.020
So,
what have you been up to today?

21:31.180 --> 21:34.140
Uh... not much, really.

21:34.220 --> 21:35.540
This and that.

21:35.620 --> 21:37.140
Go on.

21:38.580 --> 21:41.340
Uh... I went home.

21:41.420 --> 21:44.660
Did some study.
Kicked a ball around.

21:44.740 --> 21:47.620
Played some video games.
Pretty boring, really.

21:47.700 --> 21:48.900
No, it's interesting.

21:49.900 --> 21:51.060
What else have you been doing?

21:51.140 --> 21:52.980
Stop avoiding the question.

21:53.060 --> 21:56.220
And what question is that?
-About your day.

21:56.300 --> 21:58.100
My day?
-Yeah.

21:58.180 --> 21:59.980
The moon ring lesson.

22:00.060 --> 22:02.420
Are you a master yet?
-Not quite.

22:03.420 --> 22:05.540
There were a few hiccups.

22:05.620 --> 22:06.940
Such as?

22:08.180 --> 22:11.300
Let's just say, these things are
harder to use than I thought.

22:11.380 --> 22:13.020
You'll get the hang of it.

22:17.340 --> 22:19.340
It was amazing.

22:19.420 --> 22:21.260
I... I've never seen a dolphin
give birth before.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.780
I can't believe you figured out
she was in labor.

22:23.860 --> 22:26.500
Nobody else picked it.
-Uh... female intuition.

22:26.580 --> 22:29.100
I think it's something
more than that.

22:29.980 --> 22:33.540
I just looked at her and...
I had this feeling.

22:33.620 --> 22:35.660
It was a lucky guess, really.

22:35.740 --> 22:37.500
Mimmi, it's me.

22:37.580 --> 22:39.740
You don't have to be modest.
I know you're special.

22:40.700 --> 22:44.540
I mean, I know you have some kind
of special connection with dolphins.

22:44.620 --> 22:46.780
Come on, you can tell me.
How did you figure it out?

22:48.780 --> 22:50.060
Honestly?

22:52.260 --> 22:53.500
I asked her.

22:55.180 --> 22:57.020
Yeah, sure.

23:00.700 --> 23:03.460
Ah, you almost had me there!

23:03.540 --> 23:04.860
You feel like something to eat?

23:04.940 --> 23:06.460
Sounds great.
-Okay.

23:06.540 --> 23:08.300
<i>* In this world *</i>

23:08.380 --> 23:09.700
<i>* We're all alone *</i>

23:09.780 --> 23:13.100
<i>* You know I love</i>
