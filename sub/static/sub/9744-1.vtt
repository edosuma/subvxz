01:21.960 --> 01:24.451
Now, that's a roar, Boog.

01:24.896 --> 01:26.659
Now get in. We're gonna be late.

01:28.133 --> 01:32.866
No denying. The girl's got growl.
But can she get down like this?

01:33.038 --> 01:35.768
Can you get down like this?
Bring it here. Bring it.

01:35.941 --> 01:38.705
Then bring it right back, huh?
Look at that. Look at that.

01:53.558 --> 01:55.185
Here it comes.

02:42.173 --> 02:44.073
Hey, Gordy.

02:45.076 --> 02:46.771
Morning, Beth.

02:56.621 --> 03:00.057
Welcome to Timberline's
Wilderness Extravaganza.

03:00.225 --> 03:02.750
I'm Ranger Beth.

03:02.927 --> 03:05.657
Please, put your hands together
for Boog.

03:05.830 --> 03:08.993
Behold, the mighty grizzly.

03:22.314 --> 03:25.477
<i>You can say I'm in love
You could say I'm insane</i>

03:25.650 --> 03:29.677
<i>But no one understands me
Like my darling Lorraine</i>

03:37.762 --> 03:42.290
Looks like you're going
from one grill to another.

03:44.369 --> 03:47.031
We rocked that house,
didn't we, Boog?

03:47.205 --> 03:51.039
They were eating out of our hands.
Well, my hands, your paws.

03:51.209 --> 03:54.144
Eating out of your paw.

03:54.713 --> 03:58.615
That's good.
That's going in the show.

03:59.684 --> 04:03.984
Shaw.
That guy really chaps my khakis.

04:04.155 --> 04:06.248
You wait here, Boog.

04:08.326 --> 04:10.817
- Cuff him, Gordy.
- Oh, the Girl Scouts are here.

04:10.995 --> 04:12.485
He's at it again.

04:13.231 --> 04:16.564
Shaw, hunting season doesn't start
for three days.

04:16.735 --> 04:19.033
What are you doing
with that buck on your hood?

04:19.204 --> 04:23.664
What? It ain't my fault.
He ran right in front of my truck.

04:23.842 --> 04:25.810
Where, on the interstate?

04:30.382 --> 04:31.974
Sort of.

04:35.019 --> 04:37.453
Where is that girl?

04:47.699 --> 04:49.929
That's nasty.

04:57.008 --> 05:00.967
What? What the--?
What's going on? Where am I?

05:01.146 --> 05:04.843
I saw a bright light and--
I saw two bright lights and...

05:05.016 --> 05:07.849
- Am I dead?
- Not yet.

05:08.019 --> 05:09.953
But seeing how
that is Shaw's truck--

05:10.121 --> 05:12.885
- What's a Shaw?
- Only the nastiest hunter in town.

05:13.057 --> 05:15.787
A hunter? Did he get you too?

05:16.494 --> 05:18.257
You don't see me tied up,
do you, baby?

05:18.430 --> 05:21.194
- This is my ride.
- Your ride?

05:21.366 --> 05:22.799
Yeah, this is my town, okay?

05:22.967 --> 05:26.232
These are my people.
This is where I reside.

05:28.406 --> 05:30.772
Nobody's hunting this bear.

05:31.276 --> 05:36.373
Really? Well, then untie me.
Please? Look, no one's looking.

05:36.548 --> 05:38.846
- Ain't gonna be able to do it.
- What am I gonna do?

05:39.017 --> 05:41.417
I don't wanna be mounted on a wall.

05:41.586 --> 05:43.816
- Calm down. Ain't gonna happen.
- It's not?

05:43.988 --> 05:48.550
- Not with that rack.
- I don't have a problem with--

05:48.726 --> 05:51.126
My... It's...

05:51.729 --> 05:55.563
I'm a unihorn. Don't look at me.
Don't look at me.

05:55.733 --> 05:59.066
I'm hideous. I'm a monster.

06:00.104 --> 06:00.238
- Tree-hugger.
- Knuckle dragger.

06:00.273 --> 06:02.035
- Tree-hugger.
- Knuckle dragger.

06:02.207 --> 06:03.469
Veggieburger.

06:03.675 --> 06:05.734
All right, all right.
That's enough, you two.

06:05.910 --> 06:08.208
Listen, Girl Scout,
they're dumb animals.

06:08.379 --> 06:14.011
I'm just respecting the natural order:
man on top, animals on the bottom.

06:14.185 --> 06:17.780
But your bear--
Now, now, your bear is special.

06:17.989 --> 06:20.924
He belongs somewhere
in the middle.

06:21.092 --> 06:25.119
Between two slices of rye,
smothered in gravy.

06:25.563 --> 06:29.932
You're a sick, sick,
twisted puppy, Shaw.

06:30.802 --> 06:35.171
Put me down for a box of Thin Mints,
will you, sweetie?

06:36.975 --> 06:40.604
Six-toed gun monkey.
Boog, come on, let's get out of here.

06:41.045 --> 06:45.607
Come on, I'm begging you.
Please, please. Just untie me.

06:45.783 --> 06:48.718
Come on. Please, please, please?

06:52.757 --> 06:55.954
Hey, go on now. Scamper on
back to the woods, little buddy.

06:59.430 --> 07:01.660
Little one-horned freak.

07:01.833 --> 07:04.859
Buddy? He called me "buddy."

07:08.506 --> 07:09.939
My buck.

07:12.677 --> 07:14.508
My truck. Why, you little--

07:14.679 --> 07:16.977
Shaw, no shooting in town.

07:17.148 --> 07:21.380
But, Gordy, that bear leaned over
and untied my buck.

07:21.553 --> 07:26.013
- Didn't you see that?
- All I see is a busted headlight.

07:26.190 --> 07:31.218
Shaw, you've been living
in the woods too long.

07:35.266 --> 07:39.760
They can't tell me what I seen,
because only I know what I seen.

07:40.405 --> 07:45.104
<i>Wheel of Fortune!</i>

07:48.646 --> 07:51.240
Big money got to come. Come on.

07:51.416 --> 07:54.647
<i>- Okay, buddy, time for bed.
- Five hundred--</i>

07:54.819 --> 07:56.912
<i>- There's no R--
- Boog.</i>

07:57.088 --> 07:59.318
Mr. Dinkleman's waiting.

08:10.602 --> 08:12.763
Good night, big guy.

08:15.139 --> 08:18.404
Oh, did I forget something?

08:23.848 --> 08:26.942
No, no, no. No more treats for you.

08:27.118 --> 08:29.518
No, stop it.

08:30.688 --> 08:33.919
Not the face.
Oh, no, not the eyebrows too.

08:34.092 --> 08:37.027
No, it's not gonna work this time.
Stop it. I'm serious, Boog.

08:37.195 --> 08:41.529
It's cute, but no-- All right.

08:44.769 --> 08:49.638
<i>If you go out in the woods today
You're sure of a big surprise</i>

08:49.807 --> 08:54.870
<i>If you go out in the woods today
You'd better go in disguise</i>

08:55.046 --> 08:57.412
<i>For every bear
That ever there was</i>

08:57.615 --> 09:00.243
<i>Will gather there together because</i>

09:00.418 --> 09:02.215
<i>Today's the day</i>

09:02.387 --> 09:09.452
<i>The teddy bears have their picnic</i>

09:09.894 --> 09:12.192
Good night, Boog.

09:20.638 --> 09:22.037
Who's there?

09:25.476 --> 09:28.604
I'm warning you. I got ten claws
and I ain't afraid to use them.

09:28.780 --> 09:32.409
- Hey, buddy. It's me, Elliot.
- What are you doing here?

09:32.583 --> 09:34.346
You helped me,
I'm returning the favor.

09:34.519 --> 09:37.147
I'm busting you out of here.
Let's go. Let's do this.

09:37.789 --> 09:40.451
Come on. Let's book it before
the warden makes her rounds.

09:40.625 --> 09:43.560
No, cornflake.
You've got it all twisted.

09:43.728 --> 09:48.995
- This here is my home.
- Sweet.

09:49.167 --> 09:51.260
Now haul your little butt
back out that window.

09:51.436 --> 09:53.370
- What's this?
- Get off of that.

09:54.005 --> 09:57.873
So soft. What is that?

09:59.877 --> 10:01.606
What are you doing in there?

10:02.013 --> 10:03.571
This place is big enough for two.

10:03.748 --> 10:06.046
- What?
- Wow, look at that.

10:06.217 --> 10:08.549
Does this look natural?

10:09.353 --> 10:11.821
- Give me that.
- Oh, who's this little guy?

10:11.989 --> 10:14.480
- Dinkleman.
- Dinkleman?

10:14.659 --> 10:17.150
Is Dinkleman your doll?

10:17.328 --> 10:20.092
I don't care about that old thing.

10:24.502 --> 10:27.198
Oh, I get it. You're like a pet.

10:27.371 --> 10:31.068
- I ain't nobody's pet.
- Right.

10:31.242 --> 10:35.201
I do what I want, when I want,
and I come and go as I please.

10:35.379 --> 10:37.506
Well, then let's go.

10:39.617 --> 10:41.278
Outside?

10:41.452 --> 10:45.684
Why would I wanna go outside
when I got all I need in...

10:47.825 --> 10:49.622
Whoa, what's that?

10:49.794 --> 10:51.887
I call them Woo Hoos, like:

10:53.364 --> 10:54.592
You want one?

10:54.766 --> 10:58.429
I know where there's a bunch of them,
but you gotta go...

10:59.370 --> 11:01.634
...outside.

11:03.441 --> 11:06.877
Inside. Outside.

11:07.044 --> 11:09.308
- Inside. Outside.
- Stop it.

11:09.480 --> 11:13.246
- Stupid nose.
- Inside. Outsi--

11:26.297 --> 11:29.630
Okay, I got that Woo Hoo right out of
one of those container doohickeys.

11:29.801 --> 11:32.292
You got that out the garbage?

11:32.737 --> 11:35.570
I had that in my mouth
and everything.

11:36.207 --> 11:39.005
Dude, you're freaking me out
with that nose thing.

11:42.413 --> 11:43.675
- Whoa.
- What is it?

11:43.848 --> 11:47.306
- It's a whole Woo Hoo village.
- Sweet.

11:49.687 --> 11:52.451
It's locked. Maybe we should
come back tomorrow.

11:52.623 --> 11:53.920
Hey.

11:55.459 --> 11:58.690
Elliot, look what you... You did.

11:58.863 --> 12:01.730
You gonna get us in some trouble.

12:04.168 --> 12:06.102
The Woo Hoo bar.

12:06.270 --> 12:09.239
She's my lady. Smooth and creamy.

12:09.407 --> 12:12.638
So bad, I shouldn't. Yet I will.

12:22.486 --> 12:24.113
What is that?

12:24.288 --> 12:26.119
Whoa, let me try.

12:30.595 --> 12:32.722
Boog. Boog?

12:34.332 --> 12:38.462
- Hello, idiot.
- It's "Elliot."

13:01.492 --> 13:03.687
I come in peace.

13:28.853 --> 13:30.320
I'm foraging.

13:30.521 --> 13:32.045
Pepperoni!

13:42.900 --> 13:48.236
- All right. Yeah, there it is. Let's go.
- Boog, party's over, let's go.

13:50.708 --> 13:54.075
- All right, yeah, there it is.
- Freeze.

13:56.180 --> 14:02.278
Behold, the mighty grizzly.
Good night.

14:15.800 --> 14:21.636
<i>If you go out in the woods today
There's gonna be some fries</i>

14:25.076 --> 14:26.805
Yeah, and the giraffes...

14:26.978 --> 14:30.505
...they taste almost exactly
like the elephants.

14:30.681 --> 14:32.876
That's messed up.

14:33.050 --> 14:34.745
Hey, Gordy.

14:38.422 --> 14:41.721
Back up quick, before she sees me.

14:48.199 --> 14:50.531
You're in big trouble, mister.

14:54.138 --> 14:57.232
You know what sugar does
to you, Boog.

14:57.408 --> 14:59.876
Straight to bed, now!

15:02.646 --> 15:05.809
I'm so sorry. It's my fault.
It won't happen again.

15:05.983 --> 15:08.645
- What if he had hurt someone?
- Gordy, please.

15:08.819 --> 15:12.482
- We're talking about Boog here.
- Hey, what are you looking at?

15:12.656 --> 15:14.851
I told you not to wait up.

15:15.026 --> 15:19.019
- I'll take him back to the woods.
- It's time to put him where he belongs.

15:19.196 --> 15:22.996
No, no, he's not ready to go back yet.
I mean, it's not my fault.

15:23.167 --> 15:26.068
I tried to teach him the basics.

15:26.237 --> 15:29.638
I took him fishing,
but he didn't wanna get wet.

15:31.075 --> 15:33.009
Gordy, please--

15:36.547 --> 15:39.414
Boog is sorry.

15:40.017 --> 15:44.010
- Beth, you're not his mother.
- I'm not mothering him.

15:46.457 --> 15:49.085
Excuse me. Go to bed, Boog!

15:55.366 --> 15:56.628
One more summer.

15:56.801 --> 15:58.826
That's all I'm asking,
one summer.

16:00.404 --> 16:02.497
Great, see? I can be reasonable.
Thanks.

16:02.673 --> 16:04.641
You know something?

16:04.809 --> 16:09.075
The longer you wait, the harder
it's gonna be for him to adapt.

16:09.513 --> 16:13.882
Oh, I'm sure he'll...
At least I think he'll--

16:14.051 --> 16:17.077
And the harder it's gonna be
for you to let him go.

16:21.258 --> 16:23.419
Good night, Beth.

16:45.082 --> 16:47.482
What am I gonna do with you?

17:00.898 --> 17:03.833
This isn't decaf. You know
what caffeine does to me, Bob.

17:04.001 --> 17:06.595
I'd be talking up a storm,
chatting your ear off...

17:06.770 --> 17:08.567
...a mile a minute
for the whole ride.

17:09.772 --> 17:15.405
Mr. Weenie, heel. Heel, Mr. Weenie.

17:17.348 --> 17:18.815
Hot.

17:24.188 --> 17:26.179
It's terrible but wonderful
at the same time.

17:26.357 --> 17:28.450
It's like freedom in a cup.

17:29.393 --> 17:31.293
Out of hand.

17:39.703 --> 17:41.694
You know, I heard Boog got loose
last night...

17:41.872 --> 17:43.464
...and he totally trashed the place.

17:43.641 --> 17:45.131
- Really?
- That's what happened.

17:45.309 --> 17:47.971
There's something wrong
going on here.

17:51.949 --> 17:55.783
You? It walks like a man.

18:03.127 --> 18:06.893
Hold still,
you two-legged latte drinker.

18:07.064 --> 18:08.292
Look out!

18:13.637 --> 18:15.002
Not again.

18:15.206 --> 18:17.766
Boog will have you eating out
of his paw.

18:19.243 --> 18:23.236
Get it?
"Paw," because he's a bear?

18:24.381 --> 18:27.282
- So anyway...
- Oh, man.

18:27.451 --> 18:31.182
Okay, relax, Boog.
You can do this.

18:32.590 --> 18:35.650
- What the--?
- I gotta hide. I gotta hide.

18:35.826 --> 18:38.488
What are you doing?
Get out of here. Hey.

18:38.662 --> 18:41.062
He's right behind me.

18:43.867 --> 18:47.064
I knew it.
That bear's corrupted my buck.

18:47.671 --> 18:49.195
Hide me.

18:55.112 --> 18:57.410
- All right, he's gone. Now get out.
- Good idea.

18:57.581 --> 19:00.311
- Where you going?
- Behold, the mighty grizzly.

19:06.357 --> 19:08.689
How cute, a donkey.

19:11.462 --> 19:14.989
- You got me in enough trouble.
- Hey, I-- You saved my life.

19:15.165 --> 19:17.429
That means
that you're responsible for me.

19:17.601 --> 19:19.865
What? Stop messing up my life.

19:20.037 --> 19:22.062
You needed to get out.
You should thank me.

19:22.239 --> 19:24.469
- Thank you?
- You're welcome, buddy.

19:24.642 --> 19:27.110
Stop calling me that. Now get out.

19:27.278 --> 19:28.870
Need to hide. Need to hide.

19:29.813 --> 19:31.041
Boog?

19:31.715 --> 19:33.808
Oh, no, you don't.
You're leaving now.

19:33.984 --> 19:35.713
- Out of the coat. Take it off.
- No. No!

19:35.886 --> 19:37.820
- Take off the coat.
- No means no.

19:39.790 --> 19:42.418
- He's eating the donkey.
- He's gonna eat us all.

19:42.593 --> 19:44.993
You know he's still out there.

19:45.162 --> 19:48.256
Eat you? He's not gonna--
Boog, what are you doing?

19:48.432 --> 19:49.990
Put that animal down this instant.

19:50.934 --> 19:53.232
- Hold still.
- No, I'm staying.

19:53.404 --> 19:54.632
But my show!

19:54.805 --> 19:56.898
Sit, Boog. You're getting a time-out.

19:57.074 --> 19:59.133
Do you hear me?
I'm totally getting angry.

19:59.310 --> 20:01.744
That guy wants to kill me.

20:02.780 --> 20:04.475
No, wait.

20:08.652 --> 20:10.119
- I chipped a hoof.
- Chipped a--?

20:10.287 --> 20:12.778
You chipped a-- I'm gonna kill you.

20:12.956 --> 20:17.017
He's harmless. Really.
Stay calm. Stay calm!

20:17.194 --> 20:18.718
Out of my way. Move.

20:18.896 --> 20:21.626
Show's over,
you four-legged freaks of nature.

20:29.073 --> 20:30.836
Perfect.

20:31.008 --> 20:32.805
Shaw. Drop that gun.

20:32.976 --> 20:36.173
You're ruining my show.

20:36.347 --> 20:39.077
Easy, now. Just line them up.

20:39.249 --> 20:42.980
Two heads, one bullet.

20:48.325 --> 20:51.761
Buttermilk biscuits.

21:05.075 --> 21:08.203
Shaw, you're under arrest.

21:09.146 --> 21:10.773
Shaw?

21:17.287 --> 21:20.723
Gordy, I didn't know
what else to do. I--

21:20.891 --> 21:23.257
It's time, Beth.

21:23.427 --> 21:25.292
But what about hunting season?

21:25.462 --> 21:28.432
Take him above the falls.
He'll be safe there.

21:28.467 --> 21:29.490
Take him above the falls.
He'll be safe there.

23:08.665 --> 23:10.530
You're gonna be...

23:11.635 --> 23:13.865
You're gonna be fine.

23:17.608 --> 23:19.872
I'm gonna miss you, big guy.

24:05.322 --> 24:07.051
Pretty.

24:15.999 --> 24:19.264
Where's home? It's gone.

24:19.436 --> 24:21.631
Someone stole it.

24:22.239 --> 24:25.402
Hey, could you keep it down?

24:25.576 --> 24:28.443
I'm trying to sleep here.

24:31.315 --> 24:32.873
You.

24:33.050 --> 24:35.280
- No, I didn't do it.
- Take a good look, Elliot.

24:35.452 --> 24:37.784
What do you see, Elliot?
Something's missing, Elliot.

24:37.955 --> 24:39.388
What is it, Elliot? What is it?

24:39.556 --> 24:41.683
Wait, don't tell me. I...

24:41.858 --> 24:43.416
Timberline is missing!

24:43.594 --> 24:46.188
- I was just gonna say that.
- My garage is missing.

24:46.363 --> 24:48.627
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner
are missing.

24:48.799 --> 24:53.827
My life is missing,
and it's all your fault.

24:54.004 --> 24:56.404
What are you gonna do?

25:02.946 --> 25:04.379
You're funny.

25:04.548 --> 25:08.416
I thought, "Maybe," but then
I was like... and then--

25:08.785 --> 25:11.310
This ain't happening.
It's some kind of mistake.

25:11.488 --> 25:14.150
Think, Boog. She's mad,
but you can fix this.

25:14.324 --> 25:16.622
All right, I'll go back
and I'll give her the face.

25:16.793 --> 25:18.420
The face.

25:18.595 --> 25:21.723
Gotta get back before
she forgets the face.

25:21.898 --> 25:25.493
That'll clear it all up right there.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the face.

25:29.406 --> 25:31.135
Boog!

25:31.508 --> 25:34.341
You can't just go wandering
around out here.

25:34.511 --> 25:36.342
You don't know where you're going,
Boog!

25:36.513 --> 25:37.912
I'm going home.

25:38.081 --> 25:40.743
Wait. Boog.

25:41.118 --> 25:43.211
I know where Timberline is.

25:43.387 --> 25:47.221
- I can get you back.
- Thank you, but no thank you.

25:47.958 --> 25:49.687
Quiet.

25:53.163 --> 25:55.996
Timberline's gotta be
around here somewhere.

25:58.468 --> 26:00.663
Well, that was quick.

26:04.408 --> 26:08.708
Now, let's see.
Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.

26:10.080 --> 26:12.548
Boog, is that you?

26:28.231 --> 26:30.290
Boog.

26:39.910 --> 26:42.401
Okay, I gotta get the lay of the land.

26:42.579 --> 26:44.513
Somehow...

26:45.115 --> 26:47.549
...if I get up high enough, then...

26:49.286 --> 26:50.719
All right.

26:50.887 --> 26:53.082
I can do this.

26:53.457 --> 26:55.925
No problem.

26:59.563 --> 27:02.157
Lost your way to Sunday school, pal?

27:02.332 --> 27:05.859
This is McSquizzy's turf.
Nobody messes with McSquizzy.

27:06.036 --> 27:07.799
Because that's me.

27:07.971 --> 27:09.939
- What?
- Touch a needle in this tree...

27:10.107 --> 27:13.304
- ...and I'll give you such a doing!
- Yeah?

27:13.477 --> 27:15.604
You and what army?

27:17.781 --> 27:19.078
Oh, that army.

27:19.249 --> 27:21.479
Mess not with the furrytail clan.

27:21.651 --> 27:25.109
Defenders of the good,
crusaders of the righteous...

27:25.288 --> 27:27.518
...guardians of the pine.

27:28.992 --> 27:31.927
Keep your tree. I'll find another one.

27:32.996 --> 27:37.399
Look! He's got a wee freakish twin
growing out of his back.

27:42.939 --> 27:45.772
Oh, this one will work.

27:45.942 --> 27:48.968
Hey. That was a warning, all right?

27:50.080 --> 27:53.140
Try that again, and I'll be kicking
your furry brown bahookie!

27:53.316 --> 27:55.307
- What?
- Hey, this is a different tree.

27:55.485 --> 27:57.112
They're all my trees.

27:57.287 --> 28:00.415
I suggest you turn round and head
right back from whence you came.

28:00.590 --> 28:03.491
That's what I'm trying to do.
So just point me the way to town...

28:03.660 --> 28:05.525
...and I'll be out of here.

28:09.733 --> 28:13.362
That's it.
You're asking for a whooping.

28:13.670 --> 28:15.069
Ready!

28:15.238 --> 28:16.728
Fire!

28:18.842 --> 28:21.834
Hey, Boog, look. No hands.

28:22.012 --> 28:23.809
I think I'm getting a sunburn,
though.

28:23.980 --> 28:25.242
Check it out.

28:27.717 --> 28:29.014
All right, where's town?

28:29.186 --> 28:32.815
Or what we would call this,
a moon burn.

28:33.924 --> 28:36.791
Look, just give me the directions.

28:36.960 --> 28:38.257
I really need to get back.

28:38.428 --> 28:39.690
So sad.

28:39.863 --> 28:43.458
- Where's Timberline?
- Okay. Okay. All right.

28:43.633 --> 28:45.260
You got it good
in Timberline, right?

28:45.435 --> 28:48.996
Coffee, Woo Hoo bars, safety.

28:49.172 --> 28:52.539
- Yeah, so?
- And still, something is missing.

28:52.709 --> 28:54.404
- There is?
- Yep. Me.

28:54.578 --> 28:56.569
And I want in, Boog.
I'll take you to town...

28:56.746 --> 28:58.839
...but when we get there,
we're partners.

28:59.015 --> 29:01.006
Deal, partner?

29:01.184 --> 29:03.982
What? Oh, no, no, no.

29:04.154 --> 29:06.213
That ain't never
gonna happen. Never.

29:06.389 --> 29:08.357
Don't you have a herd
to get back to?

29:08.525 --> 29:12.427
What--? My herd?
They-- My herd will understand.

29:12.596 --> 29:14.689
These guys are my--
They're my buddies.

29:14.865 --> 29:17.698
- They-- They want the best for me.
- Forget it.

29:19.369 --> 29:21.633
Oh, well.
Better start moving, then.

29:21.805 --> 29:23.898
Because open season starts
in a few days.

29:24.074 --> 29:26.508
Maybe one of those hunters
can give you a ride back...

29:26.676 --> 29:29.076
...on the hood of their truck.

29:30.814 --> 29:32.805
Hunters. Dang.

29:35.318 --> 29:37.513
- Okay, okay.
- So we have a deal, then?

29:37.687 --> 29:39.985
Okay, let me hear you say it.

29:43.727 --> 29:46.389
- Partners?
- You're disgusting.

29:46.563 --> 29:48.861
- What was that?
- I...

29:49.733 --> 29:52.964
- Sorry, can't hear you.
- I said, I guess...

29:53.136 --> 29:54.694
...we can be partners.

29:54.871 --> 29:57.362
Partners?

30:00.944 --> 30:03.003
Partners.

30:03.179 --> 30:05.739
Okey-dokey, this way!
Move it or lose it!

30:05.916 --> 30:08.009
You know, we should have
a secret handshake...

30:08.184 --> 30:10.948
...and like nicknames and stuff.
Like, cool nicknames, though.

30:11.121 --> 30:12.520
I'll call you Boogster...

30:12.689 --> 30:15.055
...and then you can call me
The Incredible Mister E.

30:15.225 --> 30:17.284
Isn't that great?
I came up with that myself.

30:17.460 --> 30:19.724
I made that up. You know,
this is gonna be awesome.

30:19.896 --> 30:21.363
It's just you and me.

30:21.531 --> 30:24.523
Hey, who's the lady in the shorts?

30:37.347 --> 30:39.611
I hope I'm not too late.

30:40.016 --> 30:42.177
They've been out here all night.

30:42.352 --> 30:44.343
A bear...

30:44.521 --> 30:47.217
...and a deer, working together.

30:47.557 --> 30:49.252
How far does this conspiracy go?

30:49.426 --> 30:52.088
What other animals are involved?
God bless America!

30:52.262 --> 30:55.231
I hope the bald eagle hasn't turned.

30:55.966 --> 30:57.593
No, no, no.

30:57.767 --> 30:59.758
Maybe they're right.

30:59.936 --> 31:03.303
Maybe... Maybe old Shaw is crazy.

31:03.473 --> 31:06.499
Yeah, maybe.

31:15.852 --> 31:18.821
Isn't it peaceful out here, Bob?

31:19.356 --> 31:22.154
You're right, Bob. Let's not spoil
the beauty of this moment...

31:22.325 --> 31:23.553
...with idle chatter.

31:23.727 --> 31:26.389
Some people can just jibber-jabber
till the cows come home.

31:26.563 --> 31:29.999
What does that mean, Bob?
"Till the cows come home."

31:30.166 --> 31:32.464
Where have the cows been?

31:42.746 --> 31:46.375
Okay, Forest 101.

31:46.549 --> 31:48.642
These big wood stick things
are called trees.

31:49.252 --> 31:54.383
The big rocks are called mountains,
and the little rocks are their babies.

31:56.659 --> 31:58.559
Altitude.

32:00.163 --> 32:03.462
No jelly arm, no jelly arm. Come on.

32:05.101 --> 32:07.592
- Elliot!
- Boogster, it's...

32:07.771 --> 32:09.102
How many times must I say it?

32:09.272 --> 32:11.797
I am the Incredible Mister E.

32:11.975 --> 32:13.374
Elliot, please.

32:13.543 --> 32:15.602
Look, if you don't use
the code names...

32:15.779 --> 32:18.873
...how am I supposed to know that
it's really you that I'm talking to?

32:32.228 --> 32:34.355
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I got it.

32:34.531 --> 32:36.829
Nice and easy.

32:39.869 --> 32:42.133
Just rip it off fast, like a Band-Aid.

32:42.305 --> 32:44.034
Hold still, okay?

32:44.207 --> 32:46.835
Just be calm.
This might pinch a little.

32:47.444 --> 32:51.039
- Get it over with.
- You may wanna cover your ears.

32:51.214 --> 32:52.408
Cover my--?

32:54.584 --> 32:58.987
Okay, scamper on back
to the woods, little buddy.

33:01.257 --> 33:02.747
Buddy.

33:02.926 --> 33:05.793
Okay, ladies, this dam
ain't gonna build itself!

33:05.962 --> 33:08.294
Lift that birch.
Swing those pines over here.

33:08.465 --> 33:10.262
Come on. Move it!

33:10.433 --> 33:11.695
Yo, O'Toole!

33:11.868 --> 33:14.268
- Yeah, boss?
- I want you to cantilever that cedar...

33:14.437 --> 33:18.066
...on the bias down by the north end,
you got that?

33:19.042 --> 33:21.272
Put a twig in the hole.

33:21.578 --> 33:23.102
Rookie.

33:23.813 --> 33:25.337
Take five for lunch!

33:27.383 --> 33:29.180
- What do you got?
- Wood.

33:29.352 --> 33:31.843
- What do you got?
- Wood.

33:32.021 --> 33:33.886
You wanna trade?

33:35.592 --> 33:37.082
Hey, hey, guys. Check it out.

33:37.260 --> 33:40.320
There goes the largest carnivore
in North America.

33:40.497 --> 33:44.297
- The mighty grizzly.
- And he's a good dancer.

33:44.467 --> 33:45.900
We're gonna be in a show.

33:49.906 --> 33:51.635
Come here!

33:51.875 --> 33:53.900
Hey, that's my good antler.

33:54.077 --> 33:57.137
Listen, simple. We are not "we."

33:57.313 --> 34:00.805
It's just me.
And we ain't doing no show.

34:00.984 --> 34:02.349
- Diva.
- What?

34:02.519 --> 34:04.043
I understand what's going on here.

34:04.220 --> 34:06.279
You're a little crabby
because you're hungry.

34:06.456 --> 34:07.889
I, I...

34:09.792 --> 34:11.987
I think yes.

34:12.728 --> 34:15.357
I'm starving!

34:15.532 --> 34:17.431
- Here, try this.
- I can't eat that.

34:17.600 --> 34:19.500
Picky, picky, picky.

34:19.668 --> 34:21.603
Well, what do bears eat?

34:24.306 --> 34:28.208
Fish. Bears eat fish.

34:29.779 --> 34:33.476
All right, fishies, give it up for Boog!

34:51.434 --> 34:53.299
Hey, Incredible Mister E.

34:53.469 --> 34:55.835
Yes, Boogster?

34:56.005 --> 34:59.532
- I gotta go.
- Well, go.

34:59.709 --> 35:01.700
No, I need a toilet.

35:03.112 --> 35:05.842
You know, the think tank.

35:06.015 --> 35:09.507
The log cabin, the Johnny
on the spot, the oval office.

35:10.286 --> 35:13.050
- There's none of those things out here.
- Well, what do you do?

35:13.223 --> 35:14.747
You know...

35:16.092 --> 35:18.083
...I can't remember. But listen.

35:18.261 --> 35:24.029
Don't look now, but I see a little bush
with your name written all over it.

35:24.200 --> 35:25.827
A bush? Are you serious?

35:26.002 --> 35:28.027
Go on. It's just like riding a bicycle.

35:28.204 --> 35:30.968
Only you're crapping on it.

35:32.275 --> 35:35.403
Show us your "grr" face, nature boy.

35:49.025 --> 35:51.516
Hey. What are you doing here?

35:51.694 --> 35:53.218
Get out of here.

35:53.396 --> 35:56.797
I'm working here. Now, go.

35:57.533 --> 35:59.364
All right, all right,
you've had your fun.

35:59.535 --> 36:02.402
Nothing to see here.
Let the bear do his thing.

36:03.139 --> 36:05.004
You believe those guys?

36:07.510 --> 36:08.841
Finished?

36:09.279 --> 36:11.338
I bet my nuts
that big hairy choob can't do it.

36:11.514 --> 36:14.847
- I'll take a piece of that action.
- What is wrong with you animals?

36:15.018 --> 36:16.315
Perhaps some roughage, buddy?

36:16.486 --> 36:17.714
Buddy.

36:17.887 --> 36:19.115
Perhaps some privacy.

36:19.289 --> 36:21.689
- What are doing on my house?
- This is your house?

36:21.858 --> 36:23.086
Oh, I-- I didn't know...

36:23.259 --> 36:26.057
- It would be an improvement.
- What did you just say, Rosie?

36:26.229 --> 36:28.254
Nothing. Why you gotta
be so sensitive?

36:28.431 --> 36:30.729
- Boogster, what's the deal?
- You watch your mouth...

36:30.900 --> 36:32.697
...or you'll get yourself in trouble.

36:32.869 --> 36:34.996
You're just jealous
because you ain't got a man.

36:35.171 --> 36:37.571
I don't know.
Some kind of chick fight.

36:37.874 --> 36:39.239
Elliot, what do I do?

36:39.409 --> 36:41.809
Well, that's easy.
You just gotta mark your territory.

36:41.978 --> 36:44.310
- Show them who's boss.
- All right, ladies.

36:44.480 --> 36:46.880
I'm laying down the law.

36:47.050 --> 36:49.450
Unless, of course, they're skunks.

36:51.020 --> 36:52.419
Disgusting.

36:59.062 --> 37:00.757
Giselle.

37:01.564 --> 37:03.725
Ridiculous.

37:07.704 --> 37:11.071
The woods is no place for a bear.

37:11.607 --> 37:13.234
Ducks? Okay.

37:13.409 --> 37:14.808
Look, don't move.

37:17.313 --> 37:19.975
Oh, yeah. Sprucing up.

37:20.149 --> 37:23.084
Quick. You guys gotta help me.

37:24.020 --> 37:26.955
Don't mind Deni, monsieur.
He's a bit nervous.

37:27.123 --> 37:29.057
Never been quite...

37:29.492 --> 37:33.861
...right since the great migration.

37:34.731 --> 37:39.293
There were thousands of us
when we started in the big V's.

37:40.069 --> 37:43.368
Then... Then it happened.

37:43.539 --> 37:45.268
What happened?

37:45.441 --> 37:48.877
What happened?
Open season happened.

37:49.779 --> 37:51.474
Just me and Deni were left.

37:51.647 --> 37:55.048
How can you make a V
with only two duck, you ask, eh?

37:55.518 --> 37:57.679
Well, you cannot, monsieur.

37:57.854 --> 38:00.914
It's a tragedy!

38:01.424 --> 38:03.915
Yeah, right, whatever.

38:04.093 --> 38:06.357
But check this out.
I'm looking for town.

38:06.529 --> 38:09.657
Okay? Now, could one of you guys
fly up there...

38:09.832 --> 38:12.494
- ...and show me the way?
- Fly? Fly?

38:13.369 --> 38:15.701
Quiet. They'll hear you.

38:17.006 --> 38:18.234
Giselle.

38:18.408 --> 38:20.342
- Elliot?
- Hey, gorgeous.

38:20.510 --> 38:23.343
- How you doing?
- Elliot, where have you been?

38:23.513 --> 38:26.038
Oh, you know. Big city.

38:26.215 --> 38:29.707
Kind of a road trip. Saw the sights,
hit the buffet, took in a show.

38:29.886 --> 38:31.410
Things are looking up, Giselle.

38:31.587 --> 38:34.147
Really? I heard
you got hit by a truck.

38:36.559 --> 38:37.890
That-- Rumor.

38:38.060 --> 38:40.528
You better get out of here.
Remember what happened...

38:40.696 --> 38:42.891
- ...last time you talked to me?
- Is Ian around?

38:46.502 --> 38:48.697
How long have you had that tic?

38:49.005 --> 38:50.563
I think it's getting worse.

38:51.874 --> 38:53.102
Oh, crud.

38:57.747 --> 38:59.977
Hello, "Smelliot."

39:01.617 --> 39:04.085
I called him Smelliot.

39:04.987 --> 39:08.445
Herd! Circle formation!

39:09.792 --> 39:11.817
You pinheads. That's an oval.

39:11.994 --> 39:14.758
More circle-y!

39:15.531 --> 39:17.590
You got a lot of nerve
coming back here.

39:17.767 --> 39:21.100
- Why, thank you.
- That was not a compliment, maggot!

39:21.270 --> 39:23.170
Well, he was just going.
Right, Elliot?

39:23.339 --> 39:24.601
Yeah, Ian.

39:24.774 --> 39:28.301
I had to stop by and say hello
to some of my old pals.

39:28.478 --> 39:30.469
Bob, Kevin. Jurgen,
how's the knee?

39:30.646 --> 39:34.980
I told you to leave the herd
and never, ever, ever...

39:35.151 --> 39:38.780
- Never?
- Never, ever, ever come back.

39:38.955 --> 39:40.479
Back?

39:40.957 --> 39:42.822
I'm not-- I'm not back.

39:43.459 --> 39:45.654
Me and my best buddy
are heading to town.

39:45.828 --> 39:49.093
Yeah. I sure am gonna miss
you guys.

39:49.265 --> 39:50.562
Off the upholstery!

39:51.767 --> 39:53.667
What now?

39:58.774 --> 40:03.973
So as I was saying,
never, ever, ever--

40:05.314 --> 40:07.509
A bear! Bear. Bear. A bear.

40:08.351 --> 40:10.911
Elliot, are you all right?

40:11.087 --> 40:13.817
Buttermilk biscuit.

40:14.023 --> 40:16.514
Hey, Ian. Get a load of this.

40:16.692 --> 40:18.091
Hey, cut it out.

40:18.261 --> 40:20.627
Oh, I've heard of you.

40:20.796 --> 40:25.699
You're that bear that got
his butt thumped by a squirrel.

40:26.302 --> 40:28.896
It was-- There was 20 of them.

40:29.805 --> 40:31.705
And they had nuts.

40:32.875 --> 40:34.399
Don't listen to him, Boog.

40:34.577 --> 40:37.444
Boog? What is that short for?

40:37.613 --> 40:39.843
- Booger?
- Booger!

40:40.016 --> 40:43.349
- Listen, you!
- I'm all ears.

40:43.886 --> 40:46.184
- Well...
- Boog, let's go.

40:48.024 --> 40:50.424
You two are perfect for each other.

40:50.593 --> 40:54.859
You're a loser and you're a loser-er.

40:55.331 --> 40:56.821
Herd, let's bound!

40:59.001 --> 41:00.263
Hey, Elliot.

41:00.436 --> 41:02.904
I think you lost something.

41:03.406 --> 41:06.432
Maybe it'll grow back. Bye, Elliot.

41:06.609 --> 41:07.871
Yeah, see you.

41:08.544 --> 41:12.036
See you later, backpack boy!

41:15.117 --> 41:17.210
That's right, fool. You better run.

41:17.386 --> 41:19.786
Keep on prancing,
you panty-waisted cow.

41:19.956 --> 41:21.947
Yeah. One more word,
and I was gonna rack him.

41:22.124 --> 41:23.819
- That's right.
- I was waiting for it.

41:23.993 --> 41:25.221
He's scared. He's scared.

41:25.394 --> 41:27.692
- Look at him run. Look at him run.
- Yeah, I know it.

41:27.863 --> 41:29.194
Look at him go.

41:29.365 --> 41:31.765
Are you not gonna buy him a drink
before you kiss him?

41:31.934 --> 41:34.368
You big Jessie.

41:37.440 --> 41:40.807
On your bikes,
you big numpties.

42:11.073 --> 42:16.067
That was Ian's girl
you was trying to talk to, huh?

42:18.581 --> 42:20.242
You dog.

42:21.984 --> 42:24.748
Ian's right. I'm a loser.

42:24.920 --> 42:26.512
- No, you're not a loser.
- Yes, I am.

42:26.689 --> 42:28.418
- No, you're not.
- Yes.

42:28.591 --> 42:32.186
Trust me. You know the day I met you,
Ian kicked me out of the herd.

42:32.361 --> 42:36.195
I lost my antler, I got run over
and tied to the hood of a truck.

42:36.365 --> 42:37.696
What do you call that?

42:38.968 --> 42:41.766
A loser. But check this out.

42:41.937 --> 42:44.462
Behold, the mighty grizzly.

42:44.640 --> 42:46.972
I look like a bear, I talk like a bear.

42:47.143 --> 42:50.772
But I can't fish, I can't climb a tree,
I can't even go in the woods.

42:50.946 --> 42:54.541
That's nothing. Half doe.
Half buck. I'm a duck.

42:54.717 --> 42:56.412
Hey, I ride a unicycle for crackers!

42:56.585 --> 42:58.712
- I have a glass eye.
- I can't snap.

42:58.888 --> 43:01.823
- I thought "log" was a color.
- I can't see my feet.

43:01.991 --> 43:04.391
I killed a man.

43:14.503 --> 43:16.027
Well, at least you've got a home.

43:17.073 --> 43:18.938
Home. Yeah.

43:19.108 --> 43:21.201
I sure hope so.

43:23.145 --> 43:26.012
- Crimenently! Was that your neck?
- No.

43:28.517 --> 43:31.315
My fishy crackers.
Oh, she still loves me.

43:31.487 --> 43:33.114
Thank you, Beth.

43:33.289 --> 43:35.223
I'm coming home.

43:37.259 --> 43:39.318
Try one, partner. Yeah.

43:39.495 --> 43:42.328
Woo Hoo bars they ain't,
but they take you back.

43:42.498 --> 43:44.193
You know? Remind you of home.

43:44.366 --> 43:47.028
Sweet, salty home.

43:50.239 --> 43:55.074
Oh, yeah. To be back
in my own soft bed.

43:55.878 --> 44:00.144
Eight square meals a day,
plus snacks.

44:00.316 --> 44:02.216
Beth tucking me in every night.

44:02.685 --> 44:05.085
It's like heaven to me.

44:07.490 --> 44:12.189
You know,
when we get back home tomorrow...

44:12.361 --> 44:15.057
...I'm gonna make things right
with Beth.

44:15.231 --> 44:18.962
And maybe, just maybe...

44:20.336 --> 44:23.271
...we'll find a place
for you in the garage with me.

44:23.439 --> 44:26.431
Sweet! Oh, yeah. I'm in the garage.

44:26.609 --> 44:28.668
Who's staying in the garage?
I'm in the garage.

44:28.844 --> 44:31.677
Who's got a place in the garage?
It's me. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah--

44:31.847 --> 44:33.576
- Hey, buddy?
- Yeah?

44:33.749 --> 44:38.812
Do me a favor, will you?
It's gonna sound silly, but will you--?

44:38.988 --> 44:40.421
- Ah, forget it.
- What?

44:40.589 --> 44:42.216
Come on. I'm here for you.

44:42.391 --> 44:46.487
Will you sing me
that "teddy-bear picnic" song?

44:46.662 --> 44:49.790
Absolutely. The what song?

44:49.965 --> 44:53.264
Well, Beth always sings it to me,
you know, because it helps me sleep.

44:53.435 --> 44:57.428
- Okay. I'll give it a shot.
- Thanks.

44:59.275 --> 45:03.075
<i>Once there was a magical elf
Who lived in a rainbow tree</i>

45:03.245 --> 45:05.770
<i>He lived downstairs
From a flatulent dwarf</i>

45:05.948 --> 45:07.848
<i>Who was constantly having to pee</i>

45:08.017 --> 45:10.508
<i>One day the elf could take no more</i>

45:10.686 --> 45:13.177
<i>So he went and banged
On the rude dwarf's door</i>

45:13.355 --> 45:18.952
<i>And what do you know
They suddenly both were married</i>

45:24.266 --> 45:25.597
Good night, Boog.

45:26.535 --> 45:32.633
I'm sleeping in the garage.
I'm sleeping in the garage.

45:36.245 --> 45:40.545
Come on, Mr. Weenie.
Beg. You can do it.

45:40.716 --> 45:42.843
Come on. Beg.

45:43.018 --> 45:46.317
Bob, he won't listen.
Bob, show him how to beg.

45:59.401 --> 46:00.868
Dog worship.

46:02.004 --> 46:03.232
Oh, my!

46:03.405 --> 46:06.238
- You folks all right?
- What? No, no, no! He's--

46:06.408 --> 46:07.932
Taken you hostage. I know, I know.

46:08.110 --> 46:10.271
You're safe now.
I've got the enemy neutral--

46:11.146 --> 46:15.640
There, there, Mr. Weenie.
Are you all right, baby?

46:15.818 --> 46:19.447
You're the sweetest
little weenie I ever saw.

46:20.456 --> 46:23.755
Don't be fooled. He's one of them.

46:24.493 --> 46:27.860
- Who?
- The enemy! The bear! That deer!

46:28.030 --> 46:29.429
All them animals!

46:29.798 --> 46:32.699
I have seen the future.

46:32.868 --> 46:37.100
It will start in small towns
like Timberline.

46:38.274 --> 46:40.504
<i>Soon, it'll spread.</i>

46:41.710 --> 46:47.410
<i>They will invade from burrows,
caves, petting zoos.</i>

46:49.518 --> 46:51.509
If I don't stop them...

46:51.687 --> 46:56.147
...it'll be a total reversal
of the natural order.

46:56.325 --> 47:01.262
They laugh at old Shaw,
but you'll see.

47:01.430 --> 47:04.866
The truth will be revealed.

47:05.034 --> 47:08.265
We know exactly what you mean.

47:08.437 --> 47:11.406
- You do?
- We're scientists. Well, of sorts.

47:11.573 --> 47:14.440
And we're trying to secure
photographic documentation...

47:14.610 --> 47:17.977
...of a real, live homo-sasquatchus.

47:18.147 --> 47:21.241
- Homo-say-what?
- We're looking for Bigfoot.

47:22.017 --> 47:27.614
Bigfoot--? I didn't realize
I was talking to a couple of wack jobs.

47:29.992 --> 47:33.450
Don't trust him.
Pets are double agents.

47:33.629 --> 47:37.463
The moment you turn your back,
he'll shiv you!

47:38.534 --> 47:42.903
Oh, no, he can't. We had him fixed.

47:44.840 --> 47:46.569
Boog?

47:48.143 --> 47:50.941
Boog. Are you awake?

47:52.414 --> 47:53.745
- I am now.
- Awesome.

47:53.916 --> 47:58.376
I was watching you sleep last night
and you were like a little angel.

47:58.554 --> 48:01.580
Except for you're fat
and snoring like:

48:05.861 --> 48:07.351
We're gonna work on that, though.

48:07.529 --> 48:10.089
I invented this cure
where you stick your whole hand...

48:10.265 --> 48:12.790
- ...in your mouth.
- How long before we get to Timberline?

48:13.435 --> 48:16.131
Oh, by nightfall. Easy.

48:16.305 --> 48:17.670
Are you sure?

48:17.840 --> 48:19.740
Absolutely.

48:19.908 --> 48:22.570
Hey, you wanna see
something stupid?

48:25.047 --> 48:27.447
Well, then we better get going.

48:27.616 --> 48:30.949
Right. We're on a tight schedule.
I'll carry your load.

48:31.120 --> 48:32.815
Oh, no. Whoa, wait.

48:32.988 --> 48:36.549
Look, you gotta be real careful with
him, okay, because he's real delicate.

48:39.628 --> 48:41.755
Want a fishy cracker?

48:43.532 --> 48:47.093
No. I'll eat when I get home.

48:48.704 --> 48:49.728
Listen, girlfriend.

48:49.905 --> 48:52.772
You wanna find a man like my Ignacio,
you gotta check your look.

48:52.941 --> 48:55.739
What are you saying? I'm black
and white. I go with everything.

48:55.911 --> 48:58.311
You go fine with everybody.
Maybe that's your problem.

48:58.480 --> 49:01.506
- Ain't those the same two skunks--
- I had some thoughts on the show.

49:01.683 --> 49:03.742
- My show?
- The lady in the shorts has gotta go.

49:03.919 --> 49:07.446
She's slowing us down. It's gotta
be fresh, new. I want some jazz.

49:07.623 --> 49:10.786
I'm the star, and the people out there
come to see me...

49:10.959 --> 49:12.324
...a grizzly bear.

49:14.997 --> 49:16.328
I see.

49:16.498 --> 49:20.525
You get to have the career while
I stay home and look after Dinkleman!

49:20.702 --> 49:22.795
He's not even mine!

49:23.238 --> 49:26.435
I don't get to have a dream.
Is that it?

49:28.477 --> 49:30.672
Buddy.

49:31.180 --> 49:35.378
Don't you think
I might like a little singing...

49:35.551 --> 49:38.179
- ...a little dancing, a little:
- Elliot.

49:38.353 --> 49:42.483
But no. All I ever hear is, "How long
until we get to Timberline, simple?

49:42.658 --> 49:45.593
- How long until we get home?"
- Elliot! Are those the same beavers?

49:45.761 --> 49:50.664
- No. All beavers look alike.
- Hey! Tiny dancer!

49:50.833 --> 49:53.063
Yeah, that's right! Shake it, shake it!

49:53.936 --> 49:56.200
- Let's see some moves!
- Elliot!

49:56.371 --> 49:57.463
Yeah.

49:57.639 --> 50:01.939
Elliot, this is the same dang dam.
We've been going in circles!

50:02.111 --> 50:05.012
Circle. One time around.

50:05.180 --> 50:07.876
You don't even know
where we're going.

50:10.152 --> 50:12.347
Got them, Lorraine!

50:21.430 --> 50:22.556
- What was that?
- Hunters?

50:22.731 --> 50:27.191
- What are they doing up here?
- Okay, boys. Take cover!

50:30.139 --> 50:32.505
- Boog, we gotta hide.
- I'm out of here.

50:32.674 --> 50:35.302
Boog, wait! Don't go out there!

50:35.477 --> 50:39.641
Hey, tubby, stop! Hey,
this ain't a load-bearing structure!

50:46.355 --> 50:48.016
Oh, that's bad.

50:51.994 --> 50:53.359
Rosie, in here.

51:09.178 --> 51:12.705
- Stop. Get off.
- Buddy, buddy, buddy!

51:12.881 --> 51:14.610
Crud.

51:28.363 --> 51:29.660
Shaw!

51:32.701 --> 51:35.727
Dinkleman!

51:39.508 --> 51:41.169
You're gonna be okay!

51:41.343 --> 51:44.335
We're gonna die and you know it.

51:49.084 --> 51:51.985
No one around here
to save you this time, boys!

51:52.754 --> 51:54.984
Paddle, Boog! Paddle!

51:57.859 --> 52:00.555
Grab a boulder! Grab a boulder!

52:00.729 --> 52:03.459
Left, left. Right!

52:03.999 --> 52:05.489
Oh, like you know.

52:11.740 --> 52:13.002
Where is he?

52:13.175 --> 52:15.939
He's gone. Oh, there he is.

52:16.111 --> 52:19.205
No, wait. There he is. There he is.

52:19.648 --> 52:21.115
- Why, you little--
- There he is.

52:21.283 --> 52:22.773
Quiet, I'm trying to drive.

52:28.824 --> 52:30.553
Faster, Boog!

52:31.727 --> 52:34.696
Like fishing and hunting
at the same time.

52:48.610 --> 52:52.444
- Give me a hand, Boog! Hold me!
- Stop. Get off! Elliot, get off. Get off!

52:52.881 --> 52:54.371
Stop!

53:36.692 --> 53:38.626
Dinkleman?

53:56.044 --> 53:59.138
You. You did this.

53:59.314 --> 54:00.975
- Yeah, that's right.
- What did I do?

54:01.149 --> 54:03.083
You dragged us down
to the hunting grounds.

54:03.251 --> 54:06.448
- Yeah, where are we gonna hide?
- We're sitting ducks out here.

54:06.621 --> 54:08.054
And it's open season!

54:08.223 --> 54:11.124
All right, all right. That's enough.

54:11.293 --> 54:12.954
Guys, it's not his fault.

54:13.128 --> 54:15.221
Oh, you're right, Elliot. It's your fault.

54:15.564 --> 54:16.792
- My fault?
- Yeah.

54:17.232 --> 54:19.359
If it weren't for you
I'd be home right now.

54:19.534 --> 54:21.092
None of this
would've ever happened.

54:21.269 --> 54:24.067
You said you knew the way back,
but you lied.

54:24.573 --> 54:27.838
I-- No.

54:28.210 --> 54:29.609
Okay.

54:29.778 --> 54:31.678
Okay, maybe--

54:32.147 --> 54:34.945
I thought if you hung out with me
then maybe you would like me.

54:35.117 --> 54:38.518
Oh, man. I trusted you, Elliot.

54:38.687 --> 54:40.746
I'm sorry, Boog.

54:41.189 --> 54:43.214
We're still partners, right?

54:43.392 --> 54:46.156
You know, Elliot, I'm better off alone.

54:47.863 --> 54:49.296
What about us?

54:49.464 --> 54:51.432
- Yeah.
- Yeah, what about us?

54:51.600 --> 54:53.761
Us? There's no us.

54:53.935 --> 54:57.336
You're not my problem.
And you? We're done.

54:57.506 --> 55:00.600
- But-- Boog, wait.
- Done.

56:28.630 --> 56:31.030
- Oh, no.
- Thanks for the license, Gordy.

56:31.199 --> 56:32.962
All right, guys. Good luck.

56:33.134 --> 56:37.400
- Hey, Earl. That a new truck?
- Yeah. Check it out. Jealous much?

56:39.007 --> 56:40.372
You okay?

56:40.542 --> 56:42.942
I put him way above the falls.

56:43.812 --> 56:45.473
I hope I did the right thing.

56:45.647 --> 56:50.175
Don't worry, Beth. I'm sure Boog
is happy in his new home.

56:52.754 --> 56:54.551
Stupid nature.

56:57.058 --> 56:58.650
Civilization.

57:04.032 --> 57:05.693
Hello?

57:05.867 --> 57:09.462
Excuse me. Is anybody home?

57:16.378 --> 57:18.869
Oh, sweet porcelain.

57:27.923 --> 57:31.086
And the crowd goes wild!

57:34.062 --> 57:36.860
Now, there's gotta be
a fridge in here somewhere.

58:31.353 --> 58:32.581
Oh, no.

58:32.754 --> 58:37.088
Deers, skunks, beavers.

58:37.726 --> 58:40.058
I gotta hide.

58:42.597 --> 58:45.327
That bear's turned them all.

58:56.678 --> 59:01.274
Here you go, Lorraine.
There, you get good and dry.

59:01.449 --> 59:05.351
Come morning,
we got a rebellion to crush.

59:05.854 --> 59:09.346
And then I'm gonna
take back what's mine!

59:09.524 --> 59:11.515
Elliot.

59:17.766 --> 59:20.064
Someone's been eating my candy.

59:26.207 --> 59:28.505
Somebody's been sitting in my chair.

59:34.983 --> 59:37.383
Somebody forgot to flush!

59:41.890 --> 59:45.087
And he's still here.

59:46.194 --> 59:50.460
Come back for your bear,
Goldilocks?

59:56.137 --> 01:00:02.042
Ready or not, here I come!

01:00:07.716 --> 01:00:14.485
<i>If you go out in the woods today
You're sure of a big surprise</i>

01:00:15.757 --> 01:00:23.220
<i>If you go out in the woods today
You better go in disguise</i>

01:00:23.565 --> 01:00:27.160
<i>'Cause every bear
That ever there was</i>

01:00:28.236 --> 01:00:33.071
<i>Was gathered there
Together because</i>

01:00:33.441 --> 01:00:37.673
<i>Today's the day
The teddy bears have</i>

01:00:37.846 --> 01:00:42.510
<i>Their picnic!</i>

01:01:08.877 --> 01:01:15.043
Hey, bear! There ain't nowhere
that you can hide from me!

01:01:23.391 --> 01:01:25.188
As soon as I get mine:

01:01:26.127 --> 01:01:27.355
Blowing their heads off!

01:01:27.529 --> 01:01:28.928
Good time.

01:01:51.753 --> 01:01:53.311
Elliot.

01:02:04.532 --> 01:02:06.932
No buddy.

01:02:21.983 --> 01:02:23.712
Elliot, you've gotta hide.

01:02:25.386 --> 01:02:27.445
The hunters are here.

01:02:38.166 --> 01:02:40.191
He's gonna give us away.

01:02:42.937 --> 01:02:45.929
All right! Bring it! Bring it!

01:02:46.374 --> 01:02:48.035
- Boog?
- Hey, buddy.

01:02:48.209 --> 01:02:49.642
What are you doing back here?

01:02:49.811 --> 01:02:51.870
Come on. I couldn't go home
without my partner.

01:02:52.046 --> 01:02:54.037
- I don't have a partner.
- Elliot.

01:02:54.215 --> 01:02:57.343
I don't need the herd
and I don't need you.

01:02:57.518 --> 01:02:59.008
So leave me alone.

01:03:00.388 --> 01:03:02.049
Ain't gonna be able to do it.

01:03:02.223 --> 01:03:04.248
You see, I already saved you once.

01:03:04.425 --> 01:03:08.452
That makes me responsible for you.

01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:12.225
I saw that. Come on.
Let me hear you say it. Partners.

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.493
- No.
- What was that?

01:03:15.136 --> 01:03:17.604
- I guess we can be partners.
- Sorry, I can't hear you.

01:03:17.772 --> 01:03:19.740
I said I guess we can be partners.

01:03:21.376 --> 01:03:24.038
- Partners!
- Partners!

01:03:24.512 --> 01:03:26.707
Okey-dokey. This way.

01:03:26.881 --> 01:03:30.009
- This way.
- Right. Maybe you better lead.

01:03:30.184 --> 01:03:33.881
Yeah. Let's get back to the garage,
where it's safe.

01:03:34.055 --> 01:03:36.353
- Safe?
- Safe?

01:03:39.227 --> 01:03:43.186
Hey, Boog. How many animals
can fit in the garage?

01:03:43.364 --> 01:03:44.422
How many--?

01:03:44.866 --> 01:03:46.857
Hello, Boog.

01:03:47.936 --> 01:03:50.803
So where you all headed?

01:03:50.972 --> 01:03:54.738
- To the safe place.
- This land of garage.

01:03:54.909 --> 01:03:57.776
- With buddy.
- Come on. You owe us, Tiny.

01:03:57.946 --> 01:03:59.413
- Yeah!
- Yeah! That's right!

01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:02.947
Yeah, I'm sorry about the dam.

01:04:03.117 --> 01:04:08.111
And how I messed you all up,
you know. My bad.

01:04:08.289 --> 01:04:11.884
So you're taking us with you,
right, Booger?

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:14.858
Please? Please.

01:04:15.029 --> 01:04:19.728
Look at me. I'm too pretty to die!

01:04:20.568 --> 01:04:22.468
Well, maybe...

01:04:24.672 --> 01:04:26.230
No! No! No!

01:04:26.407 --> 01:04:28.238
You ain't leaving without us.

01:04:28.409 --> 01:04:30.036
I didn't mean to call you Booger.

01:04:30.211 --> 01:04:33.908
- Can we take Giselle?
- Wait! Let me think.

01:04:35.283 --> 01:04:36.773
Hunters.

01:04:37.418 --> 01:04:41.081
Dang. Nobody's going home tonight.

01:04:41.255 --> 01:04:42.882
There's so many of them.

01:04:43.057 --> 01:04:45.184
That's it, then.

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:47.624
No more me.

01:04:50.698 --> 01:04:52.996
I guess I will be mounted on a wall.

01:04:56.938 --> 01:04:59.202
Oh, no, you won't.

01:04:59.374 --> 01:05:01.865
Now, when I'm a bearskin rug,
they can walk all over me.

01:05:02.043 --> 01:05:05.137
But until that happens,
I ain't going out without a fight.

01:05:05.413 --> 01:05:06.641
- What?
- Fight?

01:05:06.814 --> 01:05:08.975
- The F word?
- That's right.

01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:10.777
One thing you all have taught me...

01:05:11.219 --> 01:05:14.484
...the woods is a messed-up,
dangerous place.

01:05:15.656 --> 01:05:20.025
And y'all are crazy. You've been
kicking my butt for the last two days.

01:05:20.595 --> 01:05:21.584
Yeah, I kind of did.

01:05:21.763 --> 01:05:22.991
- I didn't.
- Sorry.

01:05:23.164 --> 01:05:25.496
So let's do to them
what you've been doing to me.

01:05:25.666 --> 01:05:29.158
Now, I say we give our guests
the full outdoor experience.

01:05:29.337 --> 01:05:31.066
Yeah!

01:05:31.239 --> 01:05:34.834
Hey! Is this a private fight
or can anybody join?

01:05:35.009 --> 01:05:37.204
Because McSquizzy wants in.

01:05:38.212 --> 01:05:40.146
Good. Because we'll need your nuts.

01:05:40.314 --> 01:05:42.908
- And your acorns too.
- What's the plan, Boog?

01:05:43.084 --> 01:05:45.348
Oh, we gonna run
those yahoos back to town.

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:50.014
Yeah, baby. When we get through
with them, they won't ever come back.

01:05:54.262 --> 01:05:57.561
So you think you're so tough, huh?

01:05:59.967 --> 01:06:01.992
Well, you know what I think?

01:06:02.170 --> 01:06:05.936
I think you're still
just a mama's bear.

01:06:14.315 --> 01:06:17.375
You guard the fort, Mr. Weenie.
Mama's gonna take a dip.

01:06:18.953 --> 01:06:22.184
That's good.
Mama's getting kind of gamey.

01:06:22.356 --> 01:06:26.156
Come on, Bob. There's gonna be
a full moon out tonight.

01:06:33.134 --> 01:06:35.728
- Sorry.
- Come on. Let's go.

01:06:44.645 --> 01:06:45.873
Boog?

01:06:49.383 --> 01:06:51.180
Oh, yeah.

01:06:52.653 --> 01:06:56.020
- Maria, let go.
- I'll carry it.

01:06:56.190 --> 01:06:57.953
It's empty.

01:06:58.126 --> 01:06:59.388
Ladies.

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:02.393
Heave-ho, heave-ho.

01:07:06.033 --> 01:07:08.058
This is gonna be great.

01:07:11.139 --> 01:07:13.471
You. We gonna need more ducks.

01:07:13.641 --> 01:07:16.132
Elliot, is that chocolate on your face?

01:07:16.310 --> 01:07:17.937
No.

01:07:19.814 --> 01:07:21.839
- It's a pet.
- He's gonna blow our cover.

01:07:25.853 --> 01:07:29.050
I've been living a lie!

01:07:29.757 --> 01:07:32.749
Please, take me with you.

01:07:58.786 --> 01:08:02.119
Hey, Boog. You're not still mad
about that backpack thing, are you?

01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:06.590
Oh, no. I never hold a grudge.
I just let them go.

01:08:07.695 --> 01:08:08.684
What was that?

01:08:11.899 --> 01:08:13.594
It's the signal.

01:08:17.537 --> 01:08:20.734
Okay, Deni. Let's round them up!

01:08:20.908 --> 01:08:23.774
All right, ladies. Let her rip!

01:08:34.555 --> 01:08:36.613
- Gas mask.
- Got it!

01:08:42.263 --> 01:08:43.491
My pants!

01:08:44.899 --> 01:08:46.832
Good job, Reilly. All right.

01:08:47.001 --> 01:08:49.662
Time to run
these guys back to town.

01:08:50.638 --> 01:08:51.899
Are you ready for this?

01:08:52.073 --> 01:08:56.772
- This is awkward.
- Yes. Yes, it is.

01:08:59.447 --> 01:09:01.881
- Can I?
- Go for it, Smelliot.

01:09:02.049 --> 01:09:04.210
Charge!

01:09:06.287 --> 01:09:09.551
Holy stampede! It's a stampede!

01:09:10.057 --> 01:09:12.389
All right. Show me your "grr" face!

01:09:15.062 --> 01:09:16.723
Now, let's kick
some hunter bahookie!

01:09:18.832 --> 01:09:20.663
Bob, we've been robbed!

01:09:20.835 --> 01:09:22.894
And they took Mr. Weenie!

01:09:23.738 --> 01:09:26.673
Come on, mate!
Move them pudgy wee legs!

01:09:26.841 --> 01:09:29.537
I feel so alive!

01:09:29.977 --> 01:09:32.309
Drop antlers!

01:09:42.156 --> 01:09:43.384
Bless me.

01:09:47.895 --> 01:09:50.557
No! No!

01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:53.528
How you doing, partner?

01:09:53.701 --> 01:09:56.898
Boog, this is great.
Let's do this every year.

01:10:04.679 --> 01:10:06.943
No, no! Get that bill away from me.

01:10:12.753 --> 01:10:14.084
Fire!

01:10:16.190 --> 01:10:18.317
Guys, let's get out of here!

01:10:31.906 --> 01:10:33.134
Sheriff! Sheriff!

01:10:33.307 --> 01:10:36.674
The animals are going wild,
and the bear is their leader!

01:10:37.845 --> 01:10:39.210
It's for you.

01:10:41.182 --> 01:10:42.843
Gordy, I'm bringing him home.

01:10:43.017 --> 01:10:45.781
Come on, men!
They're just animals.

01:10:47.922 --> 01:10:49.617
Elliot, catch.

01:10:51.225 --> 01:10:52.817
Got it.

01:10:53.728 --> 01:10:55.855
Present arms!

01:10:57.932 --> 01:11:01.095
Yeah!

01:11:03.304 --> 01:11:04.794
Fire!

01:11:06.307 --> 01:11:07.672
Oh, my God!

01:11:09.076 --> 01:11:10.304
Back to the trucks!

01:11:10.478 --> 01:11:12.446
Boog, it's working.

01:11:12.613 --> 01:11:14.205
Yeah. Look at them run.

01:11:14.382 --> 01:11:16.850
- Send in Mr. Happy!
- Who?

01:11:18.285 --> 01:11:19.752
Go, go, go!

01:11:22.623 --> 01:11:24.386
Adieu!

01:11:28.963 --> 01:11:30.726
Mr. Happy didn't go off.

01:11:30.898 --> 01:11:33.526
Hey, whoa. We're just supposed
to run them into town.

01:11:33.701 --> 01:11:38.502
Well, it's time for them
to start running, isn't it?

01:11:44.912 --> 01:11:47.779
Hey, Earl, ain't that your truck?

01:11:49.583 --> 01:11:51.210
That's a bummer.

01:12:02.329 --> 01:12:05.059
That's right. Keep running.

01:12:07.067 --> 01:12:08.398
Sweet.

01:12:08.569 --> 01:12:10.537
Freedom!

01:12:25.553 --> 01:12:29.011
Hello, Goldilocks.

01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:30.452
What?

01:12:32.493 --> 01:12:34.120
Bull's-eye!

01:12:38.899 --> 01:12:41.026
Quick! We need more ammo.

01:12:44.805 --> 01:12:47.501
Elliot! Elliot, stop helping me.

01:12:47.675 --> 01:12:51.042
- Keep it coming.
- Okay. Let's see how you like it.

01:12:51.779 --> 01:12:53.508
A pillow? Oh, come on!

01:12:53.681 --> 01:12:55.615
More! More!

01:12:59.653 --> 01:13:01.086
All right.

01:13:01.255 --> 01:13:03.086
Come on, mama's bear.

01:13:03.257 --> 01:13:06.317
You can do better than that.
Let's see what you got.

01:13:07.628 --> 01:13:08.925
Come on.

01:13:10.531 --> 01:13:12.260
Boog!

01:13:18.105 --> 01:13:21.871
Oh, yeah. Don't mess
with the Boogster. Fore!

01:13:23.677 --> 01:13:25.508
All right, Lorraine.

01:13:25.679 --> 01:13:28.477
Let's kiss this bear good night.

01:13:52.239 --> 01:13:54.571
No! No! Stop!

01:14:03.017 --> 01:14:04.484
Elliot?

01:14:09.723 --> 01:14:11.156
Buddy?

01:14:16.363 --> 01:14:18.661
Oh, Elliot.

01:14:23.037 --> 01:14:25.096
You all right, Elliot?

01:14:26.607 --> 01:14:29.235
I'm a little lightheaded.

01:14:32.479 --> 01:14:35.778
Hey, Tiny. Nice show.

01:14:36.417 --> 01:14:39.284
- Behold, the mighty grizzly.
- Boog, Boog, Boog.

01:14:43.357 --> 01:14:44.722
- Let's get him!
- What? No!

01:14:46.026 --> 01:14:48.426
- Stay away! No!
- Here you go.

01:14:48.596 --> 01:14:50.996
Cannonball!

01:14:52.333 --> 01:14:54.767
You know, Elliot,
this place ain't so bad.

01:14:54.935 --> 01:14:56.527
Hold that thought. Oh, yeah.

01:14:56.704 --> 01:14:59.070
Karate noises!

01:15:12.252 --> 01:15:13.241
No.

01:15:18.192 --> 01:15:21.252
- Beth?
- Boog?

01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:34.568
Oh, Boog.

01:15:34.742 --> 01:15:36.835
- What's he doing?
- Is he not gonna maul her?

01:15:37.011 --> 01:15:40.742
No. She's his mom.
She's taking us home.

01:15:40.914 --> 01:15:42.609
Every buddy?

01:15:42.783 --> 01:15:46.879
I was so worried.
I'm bringing you back with me.

01:15:47.054 --> 01:15:49.079
Come on. Let's go home.

01:16:17.017 --> 01:16:19.349
Oh, no.

01:16:23.657 --> 01:16:25.955
Come on, Boog. Let's go home.

01:16:34.768 --> 01:16:36.292
Boog?

01:16:51.418 --> 01:16:52.976
You are home.

01:16:58.559 --> 01:17:00.789
I'm so proud of you.

01:17:02.529 --> 01:17:06.693
So how are we both
gonna fit in the helicopter?

01:17:06.867 --> 01:17:08.391
- She's coming back, right?
- Who?

01:17:08.569 --> 01:17:10.434
The shorts lady. Boog?

01:17:10.804 --> 01:17:12.635
- Hey, big guy.
- What's up, Tiny?

01:17:12.806 --> 01:17:14.137
- What's up?
- You said that we--

01:17:14.308 --> 01:17:15.935
- You're judging me?
- How y'all doing?

01:17:16.110 --> 01:17:17.270
- Hey, Boog.
- Hi, Boog.

01:17:17.444 --> 01:17:19.878
I know he's a duck.
But he treats me like a lady.

01:17:20.047 --> 01:17:21.275
- But she's--
- Hey, buddy.

01:17:21.448 --> 01:17:24.212
- Hey, find me some food.
- Come on. What is our pickup time?

01:17:24.384 --> 01:17:27.649
Elliot, we're staying here.
This is our home.

01:17:27.821 --> 01:17:30.984
These are our people.
This is where we reside.

01:17:31.158 --> 01:17:32.921
What? Are you insane?

01:17:33.093 --> 01:17:35.061
Where have you been
for the last two days?

01:17:35.229 --> 01:17:38.756
This place is horrible. Horrible!

01:17:38.932 --> 01:17:41.696
- Hey, guys.
- What's up, Ian?

01:17:44.805 --> 01:17:46.670
Come on, Elliot. It ain't that bad.

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:49.707
She's at least gonna bring
some Woo Hoo bars, right?

01:17:49.877 --> 01:17:51.606
It's just the two of us, Elliot.

01:17:51.779 --> 01:17:53.679
Unless you plan
on going back to your herd.

01:17:53.847 --> 01:17:56.748
What? And break up the team?
Bros before does.

01:17:56.917 --> 01:17:58.851
Yeah. Bros before does.

01:17:59.019 --> 01:18:01.146
Hello, Elliot.

01:18:01.321 --> 01:18:03.050
Catch you later, Boog.

01:18:09.363 --> 01:18:13.459
Hey! Get off my trees,
you bucktoothed sporran!

01:18:15.068 --> 01:18:17.559
Feels like home, baby.

01:18:17.738 --> 01:18:19.365
Hey, Boog!

01:18:20.274 --> 01:18:23.141
- Rabbit fight!
- Oh, no, you didn't.

01:18:23.310 --> 01:18:25.904
Oh, yeah? Well, eat rabbit.

01:18:26.747 --> 01:18:28.146
Hey, buddy.

01:18:54.074 --> 01:18:55.302
Bob! Bob!

01:19:02.382 --> 01:19:06.478
A real live homo-sasquatchus.

01:19:09.690 --> 01:19:14.024
Wait, wait. No. No. No!
