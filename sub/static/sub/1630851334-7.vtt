WEBVTT

00:37.037 --> 00:39.164
The intruder?

00:40.165 --> 00:42.459
We haven't located him yet, sir.

00:46.212 --> 00:48.089
Make sure you catch him.

00:48.173 --> 00:49.883
The VIPs will arrive soon.

01:07.108 --> 01:10.236
EPISODE 7
VIPS

01:36.930 --> 01:40.100
Deok-su, honey, so glad you won.

01:41.643 --> 01:42.769
How…

01:43.520 --> 01:44.395
how the hell…

01:44.979 --> 01:45.897
What?

01:46.981 --> 01:49.609
You're looking at me
like you've seen a ghost. Are you okay?

01:54.739 --> 01:57.700
The masked guys all called me this,
"the weakest link."

01:59.869 --> 02:03.581
Like when nobody chooses you as a partner
for things when you were a kid.

02:04.082 --> 02:06.251
Hey, this guy knows about it.

02:06.334 --> 02:07.585
The weakest link!

02:09.712 --> 02:13.383
And after that, they gently
escorted me back to this dorm.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.304
Because…

02:19.264 --> 02:22.016
they said that it's all
a part of a rule that…

02:22.684 --> 02:24.018
in the old days…

02:24.936 --> 02:28.106
not to let a kid turn
into some kind of an outcast, I guess.

02:28.648 --> 02:31.484
Goddamn it!

02:31.568 --> 02:33.278
It's amazing, isn't it?

02:57.302 --> 02:58.511
Front Man speaking.

03:00.555 --> 03:03.183
I'm happy to hear you enjoy the game, sir.

03:04.517 --> 03:08.813
Yes, sir. The host is currently waiting
for the VIPs to arrive.

03:38.426 --> 03:40.345
Are you in here right now?

03:41.137 --> 03:43.473
You're good, but you made one mistake.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.976
I always put the receiver down
the other way.

03:57.654 --> 04:01.407
The bullet you shot was from
a Smith and Wesson M60 revolver,

04:01.950 --> 04:04.327
standard issue for Korean police.

04:05.995 --> 04:07.956
What's a cop doing here

04:09.707 --> 04:10.917
without a partner?

04:13.670 --> 04:16.631
I am sure you have lots of questions.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.759
It's not too late to come out and talk.

04:22.553 --> 04:24.013
I don't know how you got in,

04:24.514 --> 04:27.350
but you can't leave this place
without my permission.

05:23.072 --> 05:24.407
We found a body.

05:24.907 --> 05:26.034
Where is it?

05:27.076 --> 05:29.495
The northern coast of the island.

06:25.593 --> 06:26.886
Don't worry about it.

06:32.266 --> 06:34.644
He was an old man
you only knew for a few days.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.691
See that man there?

06:41.401 --> 06:42.693
His partner was his wife.

07:12.181 --> 07:13.933
We found this police ID on him.

07:17.228 --> 07:19.730
HWANG JUN-HO
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

07:22.233 --> 07:23.985
The VIPs have arrived.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.576
Incinerate the body.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.667
Let…

07:40.460 --> 07:43.504
Let's just stop all this.
I can't keep doing this. I can't.

07:47.550 --> 07:50.428
The majority must agree.
Well, come on, let's get out.

07:50.511 --> 07:53.055
Half of us, that's all we need
to end this right now.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.142
Don't any of you want to leave
this horrible place?

07:56.642 --> 07:59.812
Anyone who wants to go, stand up.
Let's get out of here.

08:06.819 --> 08:08.821
How can you call yourselves human?

08:10.656 --> 08:13.826
How many of you can continue
with this insanity

08:13.910 --> 08:15.578
just for the money?

08:17.205 --> 08:20.041
You just had to kill the ones
you were the closest to at this place,

08:20.124 --> 08:21.584
and you're good with that

08:21.667 --> 08:23.461
just to get the money?

08:24.045 --> 08:26.172
So what if we stop now?

08:28.299 --> 08:31.719
You think your wife will stop being dead
if we all go now?

08:33.304 --> 08:35.598
And she'll forgive you
for letting her get murdered?

08:36.390 --> 08:38.935
If you can't keep going,
then why are you alive right now?

08:39.018 --> 08:41.229
You should've been the one
who died in there instead.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.440
See that?

08:45.858 --> 08:47.401
That's the price of being in here.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.279
And your wife and the others
paid it with their lives.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.906
-No.
-And you wanna go and leave?

08:52.657 --> 08:54.283
You wanna start from the beginning again?

08:55.868 --> 08:58.079
You ready to do all that, huh?

08:58.162 --> 09:00.373
Starting over again
from nothing with that guilt.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.627
And is everybody here
ready to do that as well?

09:05.920 --> 09:08.381
Go ahead, stand up!
Let's see who thinks they are.

09:09.757 --> 09:12.134
Get up and get out of here!

09:16.472 --> 09:18.516
No…

09:50.548 --> 09:52.717
The VIPs have arrived outside.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.831
Greetings.

10:23.914 --> 10:27.376
I hope your long trip here
has not been too difficult.

10:28.002 --> 10:29.253
I am the Front Man.

10:29.337 --> 10:32.506
I oversee all of the operations here
at this facility.

10:33.674 --> 10:35.426
It is a true honor to welcome you.

10:36.552 --> 10:37.845
Where is the host?

10:37.928 --> 10:42.475
Regrettably, some urgent business
has prevented him from attending.

10:42.975 --> 10:43.851
Seriously?

10:44.644 --> 10:47.480
I find it hard to believe
the host would miss a night like tonight.

10:47.563 --> 10:50.107
He asked me
to apologize on his behalf.

10:50.191 --> 10:51.942
Did some problem happen here?

10:52.026 --> 10:52.943
Not at all.

10:53.778 --> 10:56.113
It's just a personal matter of the host.

10:56.197 --> 10:58.574
The remaining games
will be held as scheduled.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.786
I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

11:01.869 --> 11:03.120
Well, I hope not.

11:03.829 --> 11:07.792
Listen, I'm willing to give anybody
some slack. That's not a problem.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.963
I just have to say
that I'm a difficult man to please.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.591
I hope you won't disappoint me.

11:17.426 --> 11:18.427
Shall we?

11:36.821 --> 11:39.240
Oh, Lord, be my shepherd, be my guide.

11:39.323 --> 11:40.741
May you watch over me tonight.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.660
May you give me protection and strength

11:42.743 --> 11:44.704
that I need to make my way
through these routes,

11:44.787 --> 11:46.539
and may you light the path
to my salvation.

11:47.331 --> 11:48.833
I give myself to you, Oh Lord.

11:48.916 --> 11:51.544
Please look down on me
with pity and forgiveness.

11:51.627 --> 11:54.338
I pray for those who have sacrificed
themselves for me,

11:54.422 --> 11:55.923
or forgive them as well.

11:56.006 --> 11:58.134
Hear me, Oh Lord, help me and forgive me

11:58.217 --> 12:00.052
for what I have done and what I may do.

12:00.636 --> 12:02.596
I live with my heart only by your graces.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.683
I am your humble servant,
and I seek repentance for my sins.

12:06.308 --> 12:08.561
Oh, God, protect me and save my soul.

12:08.644 --> 12:09.979
I know I'm a sinner,

12:10.062 --> 12:12.106
but I seek holy absolution in your light.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.193
I am dying to know what this next game is.

12:16.277 --> 12:17.695
Give us a hint, will you?

12:18.487 --> 12:22.950
As much as I'd like to, sir,
I'd hate to ruin the fun for everyone.

12:23.784 --> 12:25.786
The games of this edition
have been amazing.

12:26.454 --> 12:29.123
Right.
The contest in Korea was the best.

12:30.207 --> 12:31.542
Thank you.

12:31.625 --> 12:34.962
I believe this next game
will exceed your expectations.

12:35.045 --> 12:37.047
Well, that's why
we came all this way.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.342
Trust me. The screens
we have at home are plenty big, but…

12:41.010 --> 12:43.179
nothing beats seeing with your own eyes.

12:44.054 --> 12:44.889
No!

12:44.972 --> 12:48.058
No, don't do it, you idiot! You asshole!

12:48.142 --> 12:49.560
Fucking loser!

12:49.643 --> 12:51.270
What are you so worked up about?

12:51.353 --> 12:53.939
I put a lot of money
on that dickhead to win.

12:54.023 --> 12:55.065
Oh!

12:55.149 --> 12:56.984
How much did you bet?

12:57.067 --> 12:58.694
-A million bucks!
-Ooh.

12:58.778 --> 13:02.531
What convinced you
to bet so much on number 69?

13:02.615 --> 13:07.620
Oh, it's, uh, such a beautiful number, 69.

13:07.703 --> 13:10.164
Oh, you dirty dog.

13:10.873 --> 13:11.874
Oh.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.961
You can place your bets again
before the next game begins.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.633
Why don’t you all get some rest
in your rooms?

13:21.258 --> 13:23.969
We’ll come and get you
when everything’s ready.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.513
I'm looking forward to it.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.183
So, will you bet on brain or muscle?

13:29.266 --> 13:30.935
So who you're putting
your money on this time?

13:31.018 --> 13:32.228
I think
I'm going muscle all the way.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.522
-I still haven't decided yet.
-Number 101.

13:34.605 --> 13:36.106
-What about you?
-I'm torn between a couple of them.

13:36.190 --> 13:37.608
Sixty-two, I think.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.668
Your shift's over.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.907
Player 69, eliminated.

15:24.632 --> 15:28.677
Attention, all players.
The fifth game is about to begin.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.263
All players,
follow the staff's instructions

15:31.347 --> 15:33.724
and swiftly make your way
towards the game hall.

16:04.421 --> 16:07.341
So how are your scores
so far? Bet on any winners?

16:07.841 --> 16:09.385
No.

16:10.469 --> 16:13.138
For some reason, I keep picking losers.

16:13.847 --> 16:15.432
Now is your chance to catch up.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.602
The serious betting starts in this round.

16:19.353 --> 16:21.146
And how much you gonna bet?

16:22.064 --> 16:24.775
I’m doubling my stakes on this round.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.111
Are you sure about that?

16:27.194 --> 16:29.071
You don't even know
what game it’s gonna be.

16:29.905 --> 16:33.450
It doesn't matter what game it is,
I trust my gut.

16:53.053 --> 16:53.971
Goddamn it.

16:54.054 --> 16:56.724
Just tell us about the next game.

16:56.807 --> 16:59.351
How long are you gonna string us
along like this?

16:59.435 --> 17:03.188
He's in a bad mood because of 69.
Better tell him quickly.

17:03.272 --> 17:06.942
Gentlemen,
let me introduce the next game.

17:15.951 --> 17:17.244
What's that thing?

17:17.911 --> 17:21.165
Looks like a bridge of some sort.

17:21.665 --> 17:23.125
I like the looks of it.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.128
What the hell is that?

17:58.452 --> 18:00.746
Welcome, players, to the fifth game.

18:00.829 --> 18:04.083
Before we begin,
please make your way down the steps

18:04.166 --> 18:07.169
and choose one of the mannequins
that you see presented before you.

18:07.252 --> 18:09.963
Once you've chosen,
take the corresponding vest.

18:10.047 --> 18:12.007
They are numbered 1 through 16.

18:13.550 --> 18:15.469
Let me repeat the instructions.

18:16.261 --> 18:18.013
Please make your way down the steps

18:18.097 --> 18:20.891
and choose one of the mannequins
that you see before you,

18:20.974 --> 18:22.559
and take the corresponding vest.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.853
They are numbered 1 through 16.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.317
Ooh, this is exciting.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.987
Gentlemen,
this may be the deciding moment.

18:34.071 --> 18:35.280
There are plenty of other variables,

18:35.364 --> 18:37.658
but I think the order,
in which they compete, matters most.

18:37.741 --> 18:39.576
Who are you betting on this time?

18:42.246 --> 18:43.497
Ninety-six.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.040
What's your reason?

18:45.624 --> 18:47.709
Well, if I can't do 69,

18:48.961 --> 18:50.379
I'll try 96.

18:53.757 --> 18:56.218
-Good luck with that.
-How do you know this guy?

18:56.301 --> 18:58.178
I didn't bring him.
I thought you brought him.

18:58.262 --> 19:00.430
Me? No.

19:01.473 --> 19:03.308
Oh, jeez. You kill me.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.811
Oh.

19:15.779 --> 19:17.573
There are 16 people left,

19:18.198 --> 19:19.616
and there are 16 numbers.

19:35.257 --> 19:38.594
It was on the sixth day
that God created the first man on Earth.

19:39.303 --> 19:42.264
And now, I will go back
to that day God made us

19:42.931 --> 19:44.641
sinless and innocent.

19:56.945 --> 19:59.907
Okay. Lucky number seven, come on.

20:10.834 --> 20:12.002
Mm.

20:17.132 --> 20:19.218
They always take the middle numbers first.

20:19.301 --> 20:20.886
Animal instinct.

20:22.012 --> 20:25.766
When faced with danger,
seek refuge in the herd.

20:25.849 --> 20:28.143
What should I do?

20:28.227 --> 20:30.145
The middle numbers are all taken.

20:31.230 --> 20:34.858
Only two choices left. Front or back?

20:36.276 --> 20:38.320
I can't say I'd know
which one to choose either.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.906
Shall I help them along
with their decision?

20:40.989 --> 20:43.242
Sure, drop them a hint.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.662
Show mercy to the miserable!

20:47.329 --> 20:48.580
Okay, do it.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.418
Your attention, please.

20:53.502 --> 20:55.462
The numbers you see on the mannequins

20:55.545 --> 20:58.924
correspond to the order
in which you will be playing.

20:59.007 --> 21:00.926
Please make your decision carefully.

21:02.719 --> 21:03.804
The order?

21:04.721 --> 21:05.889
That we're playing in?

21:07.766 --> 21:08.600
Okay.

21:09.726 --> 21:12.521
If this is the order we'd play,
then the low numbers are better.

21:13.355 --> 21:17.943
It's probably gonna have a time limit
like Red Light, Green Light and Honeycomb.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.153
It's better to get a head start.

21:21.947 --> 21:22.864
Wait.

21:22.948 --> 21:23.991
No.

21:24.908 --> 21:27.869
It'd be too dangerous to go first
without knowing the game.

21:28.745 --> 21:30.914
If I stay in the back,
I can watch the ones who go first

21:30.998 --> 21:32.749
and make a plan like in Tug-of-War.

21:42.718 --> 21:43.802
Sixteen.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.305
I can't go with 16.

21:46.388 --> 21:48.932
Whatever it is,
it's too dangerous to go last.

21:59.985 --> 22:02.612
Number 1? That means
I'll be starting the game off.

22:03.822 --> 22:05.240
Then should I go last?

22:05.991 --> 22:07.451
No, that seems wrong too.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.080
Gi-hun, pull yourself together.

22:12.581 --> 22:14.583
Down to two positions,

22:15.250 --> 22:16.668
first and last.

22:16.752 --> 22:19.212
Mm. The start and the finish.

22:19.296 --> 22:21.298
Two places you really don't wanna be.

22:21.381 --> 22:24.301
Going first in a life-or-death contest?

22:25.218 --> 22:26.178
Very scary.

22:26.261 --> 22:29.264
But recall, too, that in the first game,

22:29.348 --> 22:34.144
most of the contestants in the back died
after running out of time, so…

22:34.227 --> 22:37.356
you can't feel too comfortable
picking 16 either.

22:38.148 --> 22:40.484
You bet on 96, right?

22:41.068 --> 22:42.194
Yeah.

22:43.570 --> 22:44.988
Pick a good one.

22:46.990 --> 22:47.908
What?

22:49.451 --> 22:50.952
Where are you going?

22:52.287 --> 22:53.413
Excuse me.

22:58.543 --> 23:00.629
Could I be number one instead?

23:01.922 --> 23:03.298
As long as I can remember,

23:03.382 --> 23:05.592
I've been hiding behind people
when I got scared.

23:06.468 --> 23:07.803
My life has been this thing

23:07.886 --> 23:10.305
that I've never really been able
to truly control.

23:11.098 --> 23:14.643
And I tried to act
like I wasn't afraid, but I was.

23:16.561 --> 23:19.856
And now, as always,
I'm choosing my number last

23:19.940 --> 23:21.817
after everybody else here.

23:23.026 --> 23:26.363
I wanna get at least one last chance
to claim ownership of my life.

23:27.155 --> 23:28.865
Sir, give this chance to me.

23:31.034 --> 23:32.369
Please just give me that.

23:41.002 --> 23:42.212
Thank you!

23:43.046 --> 23:45.173
-Thank you!
-You fuckwad!

23:45.257 --> 23:47.008
Piece of shit!

23:48.635 --> 23:50.178
Oh, it's really not your day, is it?

23:50.262 --> 23:53.306
First, 69, and now, 96.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.186
Motherfucker!

24:00.063 --> 24:01.773
Son of a bitch!

24:02.983 --> 24:04.943
Now, the game will begin.

24:31.261 --> 24:33.555
Oh, wow. It's bigger!

24:34.306 --> 24:37.100
Yeah. A lot bigger.

24:51.072 --> 24:55.202
Hello, players,
let me welcome you all to the fifth game.

24:56.119 --> 24:59.623
The fifth game is Glass Stepping Stones.

25:00.499 --> 25:04.294
The stepping stones before you
are made from one of two types of glass,

25:04.377 --> 25:07.923
one will be tempered glass
and the other will be normal glass.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.091
The tempered glass stepping stone

25:10.175 --> 25:13.136
as strong enough
to hold the weight of two people.

25:13.220 --> 25:17.682
However, the normal glass will break
even if just one person steps on it.

25:17.766 --> 25:21.102
For this game, you will guess
which one of next two tiles

25:21.186 --> 25:24.022
is the tile made
of the stronger tempered glass,

25:24.105 --> 25:28.068
and only step on those
across the 18 pairs of tile.

25:28.151 --> 25:31.154
You may then cross over
to the other side safely

25:31.238 --> 25:32.906
and pass this game.

25:45.961 --> 25:48.129
That means the numbers on us…

25:48.838 --> 25:51.132
Are the order in which
you will cross the bridge.

26:13.697 --> 26:17.075
But then, how do I tell
which is the tempered one?

26:39.472 --> 26:40.890
Scumbag.

26:42.809 --> 26:43.977
Ah.

26:44.728 --> 26:46.229
Bring me another scotch.

26:50.108 --> 26:51.234
Hey, you!

27:06.374 --> 27:09.210
I don't wanna have
to keep calling you back.

27:10.045 --> 27:12.922
Sit down here.

27:13.006 --> 27:15.008
I must serve the other guests, sir.

27:16.051 --> 27:18.470
I'm gonna keep this one next to me.

27:19.054 --> 27:20.305
Any objections?

27:20.388 --> 27:21.723
Not at all.

27:21.806 --> 27:24.184
-As you please.
-He's all yours.

27:27.437 --> 27:30.357
For this game, you will have 16 minutes.

27:30.440 --> 27:33.735
Players must cross the bridge
within those 16 minutes.

27:34.235 --> 27:36.988
And now, with that, let the game begin.

27:37.489 --> 27:41.701
Each player, take off your shoes,
then go up to the tiles in order.

27:52.962 --> 27:54.130
Hmm.

27:59.427 --> 28:00.387
Hmm.

28:06.601 --> 28:08.728
-What are you doing?
-We're losing time!

28:08.812 --> 28:09.854
-Hurry up and go!
-Just jump!

28:09.938 --> 28:11.690
-Are you just gonna stand there?
-Hey.

28:12.190 --> 28:14.401
Take your step now or I'll push your ass.

28:14.484 --> 28:17.862
I'll go. I'll go, okay? I'll go.
I'll go right now.

28:17.946 --> 28:20.615
And please try to choose carefully, huh.

28:25.328 --> 28:26.538
You did it.

28:28.456 --> 28:29.582
You picked right.

28:29.666 --> 28:34.212
Oh! Yes, that's it.
Keep doing that one after the other.

28:34.295 --> 28:36.005
-Come on.
-You got this.

28:36.089 --> 28:37.215
-That's it. Go on.
-Come on.

28:49.728 --> 28:50.687
He's gone.

28:50.770 --> 28:51.730
Oh, no.

28:52.313 --> 28:53.940
Well, that's it for 96.

28:54.023 --> 28:56.526
Aw, what a shame.

28:57.819 --> 29:00.613
Oh. Hmm, you've already found
some more fun.

29:02.741 --> 29:05.410
What pretty eyes you have.

29:26.264 --> 29:28.683
Step one was left.

29:29.684 --> 29:31.394
Step two is on the right.

29:56.586 --> 29:57.545
You can do it.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.839
-Hey, you got this.
-Hurry the hell up and go!

30:00.423 --> 30:01.841
I'm looking at 15.

30:02.342 --> 30:03.843
-Stop stalling!
-The tiles ahead of me.

30:03.927 --> 30:04.886
Let's go.

30:04.969 --> 30:06.179
-So the probability that…
-We don't have time for this.

30:06.763 --> 30:08.973
-I'll get everything right is…
-Hey, you got this.

30:09.057 --> 30:10.850
…two to the power of fifteen.

30:13.019 --> 30:14.187
Times that…

30:18.149 --> 30:22.403
One in 32,768.

30:29.327 --> 30:30.495
Damn it.

31:20.753 --> 31:21.963
Excuse me, ma'am.

31:22.547 --> 31:23.548
Do you think

31:24.507 --> 31:27.969
that you could help me?
You happen to remember what he chose next?

31:28.636 --> 31:30.555
I can't seem to recall which one now.

31:31.139 --> 31:33.808
Oh, I don't know,
uh, it happened too quickly.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.226
Think hard please.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.605
Since both of our lives
depend on getting this next one.

31:39.105 --> 31:40.315
Okay.

31:44.027 --> 31:46.321
-The left one I think.
-Wait, no.

31:46.404 --> 31:48.489
-He went right and then he went left.
-Uh, he didn't do that.

31:48.573 --> 31:51.492
-He went left right away.
-No, it was right from there.

32:00.376 --> 32:01.920
You, are you sure…

32:04.714 --> 32:05.924
he went left first?

32:07.258 --> 32:08.134
Mm-hm.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.115
So he went right.

32:33.326 --> 32:34.786
Number five fucked up.

32:34.869 --> 32:36.537
Another fall from grace.

32:37.121 --> 32:38.581
Take that mask off.

32:40.583 --> 32:43.962
Take your mask off!

32:44.837 --> 32:47.924
I want to see your face.

32:49.175 --> 32:51.010
Yeah!

33:03.439 --> 33:05.066
There are ten tiles left,

33:05.149 --> 33:07.110
and 11 people still playing.

33:08.027 --> 33:10.113
If they manage to step on one or two each,

33:10.613 --> 33:12.824
the three of us can get across to the end.

33:13.324 --> 33:15.201
That might not be the case.

33:15.284 --> 33:18.246
If one of those players get scared
and starts to run down the time,

33:19.205 --> 33:21.124
we are in danger at the back of the line.

33:51.487 --> 33:54.365
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name--

33:54.449 --> 33:56.242
Get up. What are you doing?

33:56.325 --> 33:58.244
-You're praying right now?
-As it is in Heaven.

33:58.327 --> 34:00.079
-Seriously?
-What's he doing up there?

34:00.163 --> 34:01.831
Come on! Just go!

34:01.914 --> 34:04.625
Hey, just get up and stop praying, okay?

34:04.709 --> 34:06.669
You idiot, it's your turn!

34:06.753 --> 34:09.714
You gotta go!
Everybody will die, you know!

34:12.592 --> 34:17.430
No number can determine
when the Lord calls for somebody.

34:20.641 --> 34:22.935
Judgment is called down to us here.

34:24.145 --> 34:25.897
It's our time to face the Lord.

34:28.191 --> 34:29.901
Anyway, we're all going to Hell.

34:29.984 --> 34:31.986
Hurry, so I can move to the next one.

34:32.070 --> 34:35.198
If you don't, then I might have
to push you into him, okay?

34:38.242 --> 34:41.913
You want a wind-up dead, buddy?
Get that asshole to stop praying.

34:45.792 --> 34:48.211
Get going, you idiot.

34:49.087 --> 34:52.090
Step forward. Come on, damn it!
You'll kill us all!

35:17.323 --> 35:20.451
Thank you. God bless me today.

35:30.586 --> 35:33.005
Don't push me.

35:33.089 --> 35:34.340
Okay?

35:34.423 --> 35:37.343
Hey, come on. I got no reason to push you.

35:38.177 --> 35:41.055
You gotta cross so I can. Huh?

36:25.850 --> 36:27.476
It's the left.

36:28.060 --> 36:29.145
It's the left one.

36:29.812 --> 36:30.855
Get it together.

36:32.940 --> 36:35.193
Okay.

36:43.993 --> 36:45.203
Thanks so much.

36:58.341 --> 37:01.010
You're doing good.
Now you just keep going.

37:07.350 --> 37:10.228
I know which one of these
is the strong glass.

37:10.311 --> 37:11.437
You mean it?

37:12.313 --> 37:14.023
You can see the tempered glass?

37:14.106 --> 37:15.358
I'm pretty sure.

37:16.359 --> 37:17.818
It's in the color.

37:30.206 --> 37:33.251
You don't know anything. Goddamn idiot.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.279
Hey, everybody, listen!

38:02.697 --> 38:04.365
Anyone wanna get across?

38:04.865 --> 38:06.325
Well, you better go first then.

38:08.911 --> 38:09.912
Ah, shit.

38:12.707 --> 38:14.709
Oh, it's getting exciting.

38:17.169 --> 38:18.879
We can't show our faces in here.

38:20.214 --> 38:21.799
You're all mine.

38:22.508 --> 38:25.803
But after you leave, they'll kill me.

38:28.639 --> 38:30.850
If you don't do what I say,

38:32.101 --> 38:34.603
I will kill you before I leave.

38:40.192 --> 38:41.277
Please.

38:42.028 --> 38:43.487
Take me somewhere

38:44.071 --> 38:45.489
where we can be alone.

38:56.375 --> 38:58.461
You're leaving
at the most exciting moment?

38:58.544 --> 39:00.338
Hey, you all have fun.

39:01.464 --> 39:04.717
I'm going off for a different kind of fun.

39:04.800 --> 39:08.262
Mmm, the real 69, huh?

39:09.263 --> 39:11.015
Bon appétit!

39:11.098 --> 39:13.434
Have a good fucking time.

39:21.108 --> 39:23.527
-What are you doing?
-You deaf or what, asshole?

39:24.153 --> 39:25.613
I'm not going until you do.

39:25.696 --> 39:26.864
Are you crazy, man?

39:28.324 --> 39:29.992
But the rule is we go in order.

39:33.704 --> 39:35.498
You can just kiss my ass.

39:36.082 --> 39:39.210
We're in Hell here.
There's no rules in Hell.

39:39.293 --> 39:41.128
You wanna go so bad? Go ahead.

39:41.212 --> 39:43.214
You scumbag!

39:45.549 --> 39:47.134
If you don't move up, I'll push you then.

39:47.718 --> 39:48.636
Okay.

39:49.261 --> 39:51.847
Well then, come on. Then do it!

39:51.931 --> 39:53.474
We'll all die here together!

39:53.557 --> 39:55.309
Hey, listen, everybody!

39:55.393 --> 39:58.562
I'm not dying here for anyone.
So come on, let's do this!

40:00.731 --> 40:02.191
Get up here and go ahead.

40:03.401 --> 40:04.944
If you don't, we all die.

40:06.362 --> 40:07.780
Your choice, dickhead.

40:08.364 --> 40:10.282
Stop that bullshit, you asshole.

40:11.325 --> 40:13.828
The clock is ticking. You gotta go soon.

40:13.911 --> 40:16.080
You'll be waiting here
till we're all dead.

40:22.336 --> 40:23.671
Oh, shit.

40:42.773 --> 40:45.025
That's not the kind of face

40:46.402 --> 40:49.613
you should keep behind a mask.

40:58.831 --> 40:59.957
Oh.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.296
If you…

41:06.464 --> 41:08.299
can satisfy me

41:09.633 --> 41:11.886
in five minutes,

41:14.096 --> 41:16.182
I'll change your life.

41:29.737 --> 41:30.863
Satisfied?

41:43.000 --> 41:45.669
If you can satisfy me in five minutes,

41:46.337 --> 41:48.005
I might let you live.

41:53.135 --> 41:56.430
Tell me everything
you know about the game.

42:05.147 --> 42:06.774
Damn it, you better go!

42:06.857 --> 42:08.025
Please just go on!

42:08.108 --> 42:09.735
Just go!

42:33.842 --> 42:35.553
My God, you're all such idiots.

42:40.224 --> 42:42.393
Man, you used to act
like such a tough guy.

42:42.476 --> 42:44.103
Babe, what happened to you?

42:44.186 --> 42:46.146
Are you really pulling the shit?

42:46.230 --> 42:51.068
-Oh, man, you're pathetic.
-You're just an ugly old bitch, okay.

42:51.694 --> 42:54.196
Look, I'm not moving forward. Not at all.

42:54.280 --> 42:55.656
Deok-su.

42:56.490 --> 42:59.243
All of these people dead
but the worst thing is…

43:00.244 --> 43:02.871
I let you fuck me
in the bathroom that day.

43:03.455 --> 43:05.165
Why don't you go first to die?

43:08.085 --> 43:09.003
Fine. Sure.

43:10.629 --> 43:12.381
You mean…

43:12.464 --> 43:14.049
-Meaning you'll go?
-Yeah.

43:15.593 --> 43:17.011
It's Han Mi-nyeo here.

43:18.512 --> 43:22.182
You don't think that I'd be able
to do something quite as cowardly as…

43:22.266 --> 43:23.892
waiting here till I die.

43:26.478 --> 43:30.566
Come on then. Go ahead.

43:41.160 --> 43:42.328
Good luck.

43:49.752 --> 43:50.878
What are you doing?

43:50.961 --> 43:52.838
You're such an idiot.

43:52.921 --> 43:55.841
Did you believe I'd really die
so you could go on?

43:58.052 --> 43:59.136
Let me go.

43:59.219 --> 44:00.262
Remember?

44:00.346 --> 44:02.139
We said we'd stick together
right to the end.

44:02.723 --> 44:05.351
Crazy bitch, let me go! Damn it!

44:05.434 --> 44:07.436
Get your fucking hands off me right now!

44:10.522 --> 44:11.732
Goddamn it!

44:13.984 --> 44:17.738
You betrayed me. Now you're going to die.

44:21.575 --> 44:22.660
No, please.

44:23.160 --> 44:25.663
I'll go first, okay? Huh?

44:26.288 --> 44:28.457
Let me go, please. Please!

44:28.540 --> 44:29.917
You coward.

44:31.585 --> 44:32.628
Deok-su.

44:33.379 --> 44:34.755
I need you to know…

44:35.547 --> 44:37.716
you've got such a tiny dick.

44:38.801 --> 44:42.554
You goddamn bitch!

45:03.617 --> 45:04.451
Oh.

45:04.535 --> 45:07.413
Now there's a poetic ending for those two.

45:07.496 --> 45:09.456
"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned."

45:10.582 --> 45:13.752
Another student of the Bard.
I had no idea.

45:13.836 --> 45:16.839
Actually, it's not Shakespeare.
It's Congreve. William Congreve.

45:16.922 --> 45:19.216
I like you better when you don't talk.

45:27.641 --> 45:29.226
Go check the VIP room.

45:32.312 --> 45:33.522
Oh!

45:46.910 --> 45:47.786
Move. Quick!

45:48.746 --> 45:49.830
You can't just stop.

45:49.913 --> 45:53.250
Hold on. Wait, one second.
I can tell the panels apart.

45:53.333 --> 45:56.587
-You can tell?
-I used to make glass for over 30 years.

45:57.463 --> 45:59.089
You can't normally tell, but…

45:59.715 --> 46:04.094
when you look at tempered glass
when it's lit from the side,

46:04.178 --> 46:07.556
then you can see faint stain marks.

46:23.781 --> 46:25.783
Another hint, the sound.

46:26.408 --> 46:30.329
Tempered glass is made
at a heat over 700 degrees.

46:30.412 --> 46:34.041
Pound on it with a hammer
and it rings clearer than normal glass.

46:34.666 --> 46:36.251
Why wasn't all this brought up earlier?

46:36.335 --> 46:38.712
-If you had led everybody from--
-Why would I?

46:39.296 --> 46:41.965
The players up here
tried to kill us at every chance.

46:43.717 --> 46:44.718
Hmm.

46:59.399 --> 47:00.943
Can he really tell the difference?

47:01.026 --> 47:02.444
I think so.

47:02.528 --> 47:04.488
LONG-TERM WORK EXPERIENCE
IN GLASS MANUFACTURING

47:05.697 --> 47:10.035
According to his file,
he once had a job as a glass manufacturer.

47:10.702 --> 47:14.331
That was in the report?
Hah! How did I miss that?

47:14.414 --> 47:15.499
I didn't catch it either.

47:15.582 --> 47:18.293
Well, that's no fun.

47:19.002 --> 47:23.382
Yup, number 13 definitely sees
something that the others can't.

47:23.465 --> 47:26.802
I think he might be examining
the refraction of the light.

47:27.469 --> 47:29.221
Let me adjust the settings.

47:54.329 --> 47:56.081
It seems to have done the trick.

47:56.582 --> 47:59.418
Yeah, he's not so confident now.

48:13.181 --> 48:14.516
What's wrong?

48:15.225 --> 48:17.978
What's the problem?

48:18.520 --> 48:20.731
I can't tell them apart in the dark.

48:25.694 --> 48:27.070
Excuse me, sir.

48:37.456 --> 48:39.041
The VIP has collapsed.

48:39.708 --> 48:40.792
Is he alive?

48:40.876 --> 48:42.252
He's fine.

48:42.336 --> 48:43.587
And the intruder?

48:44.087 --> 48:46.048
We're searching for him now.

48:56.391 --> 48:58.810
All right, which one?
You need to choose now.

48:59.436 --> 49:01.188
I need to listen to the sound.

49:02.981 --> 49:04.691
You got anything to throw?

49:07.611 --> 49:09.112
Do… do you have anything?

49:36.223 --> 49:37.265
I need another.

49:38.350 --> 49:40.352
I need to hear the right one,
so I can be sure.

50:17.973 --> 50:19.850
I can't tell what it is.

50:20.517 --> 50:22.310
I'll pick, okay?

52:23.682 --> 52:25.600
One of the dive packs is gone.

52:26.309 --> 52:28.478
I suspect the intruder took it.

52:28.562 --> 52:31.064
Start tracking it
and get the boat ready.

52:31.148 --> 52:33.483
Oh! That's hard to top.

52:33.567 --> 52:34.818
-Bravo!
-Bravo.

52:34.901 --> 52:36.778
-Bravo!
-Yes.
