Branson for, like, a zillion dollars?

We didn't invent anything, first of all.

47:34.560 --> 47:37.609
We just put it together with the directions
that we had over there, so...

47:37.760 --> 47:39.400

- Yes. So what are they?
- QUINN: What are the rules then?

48:10.280 --> 48:12.760
First rule, no jumping alone.

48:12.840 --> 48:15.161
We always have to jump
all together every time.

48:15.240 --> 48:16.560
- JESSIE: That makes sense.
- Yes?

48:16.720 --> 48:17.767
JESSIE: What else?

48:17.920 --> 48:19.251
CHRIS: Well, we could film
all of our jumps,

48:19.320 --> 48:21.640
so that if we mess something up,
we know what we did wrong.

48:21.680 --> 48:23.720
- JESSIE: That's a good idea.
- That's a great idea.

48:24.040 --> 48:26.042
And we have to keep it a secret. Right?

48:26.200 --> 48:27.361
So no Twitter, no Facebook,

48:27.440 --> 48:28.601
- none of that stuff.
- Absolutely.

48:28.680 --> 48:31.604
We should have code names.

but this machine only goes
back three weeks. All right?

than it looks, huh?

Yeah.

- Pretty dumb.

Hey, I wrote that.

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:18.641
No, you didn't.

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:21.085
- No, I didn't.
- Oh.

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:24.804
"Before the world ends,
I have to run naked through the streets."

01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:27.560
You're trying to get me
to think of you naked, aren't you?

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:30.326
Oh.

- Yes.

I was sleeping at Jennie's.

David, look at this.
There was a plane crash, David.

Seventy-seven people on board a flight
from London to Madrid.

01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:19.609
It happened five days ago.

DAVID: Jesus.

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:23.529
So, why are you guys
watching a plane crash?

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:25.804
Because I think it's our fault.

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:28.963
Why would a plane crash be our fault?

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:31.044
Sarah Nathan's dad was the pilot.

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:32.246
So what?

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.970
Look, whatever we did at Lollapalooza

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:35.645
had some crazy ripple effects.

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:38.567
Wait, wait. Are you saying
that Lollapalooza caused a plane crash?

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:40.642
Because that sounds crazy, dude.

01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:43.491
Look, I'm not crazy, okay.
It's cause and effect.

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:46.684
Somehow we caused the basketball
team to not make the playoffs.

01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:49.966
Our captain, Justin Kelly,
broke his leg on March 1st, right?

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.440
We all know that never happened.

01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:53.608
Then the basketball team
didn't make the playoffs,

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:55.648
and that affected the players,

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.331

supposed to be at the game.

at the game.

flying that night.

At some point, we're not gonna
be able to track this, David.

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:20.606

it could just keep going out of control.

who set the rules!

01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:38.841
You're the one who said that
we had to be all freaking careful!

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:40.291
I did.
We all followed them,

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:42.567
and kept each other accountable
on every single one!

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.484
I'm not gonna go and play God
with you guys...

That is what we're doing!

I'm gonna get Jessie, we're gonna come
over tonight and we're gonna fix this!

If you wanna vote on that
'cause that will make you feel better,

You're 15 minutes late.

No, we said we'd meet
at your house first.

01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:24.250
We had to track the controller.

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:25.640
Oh, yeah, why didn't you call me?

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:26.727
We all called you, David.

- Really?
- The guys are right behind me.

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:29.844
- Really?
- What did you do to the machine?

01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:31.720
You know, I'm just making
some modifications.

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:33.046
Modifications?
Why?

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:34.645
We did a full systems check yesterday.

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:36.371
Can I talk to you for a second?

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:38.164

- Just, uh...

Oh, God, man.

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.641
Can you just be my friend for a second?
I have to ask you.

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:44.085
Of course I'm your friend.

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:45.531

01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:48.644

You're not listening to me.

It's not your fault. It's my fault.

01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:57.005

- Yeah.

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:08.481

doesn't break his leg at Walker's party.

and now you're gonna do it again?

- No. I can't.

- Because...
