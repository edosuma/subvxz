00:36.458 --> 00:39.083
Despite their rich natural resources,

00:39.166 --> 00:41.958
the world of Tao struggles to modernize.

00:43.458 --> 00:45.958
In exchange for industrial advancement,

00:46.041 --> 00:48.375
Tao has welcomed the Galactic Empire,

00:48.458 --> 00:53.333
who in turn plan to capitalize
on everything this planet has to offer.

00:53.416 --> 00:57.375
However, Imperial industry has proven
to be detrimental

00:57.458 --> 00:59.291
to Tao's natural environment.

01:00.041 --> 01:02.625
Richly steeped in nature and tradition,

01:02.708 --> 01:07.250
the people of Tao grow increasingly
frustrated by Imperial oppression.

02:04.416 --> 02:06.458
So, you're one of the Empire's laborers…

02:07.541 --> 02:08.833
who managed to escape.

02:08.916 --> 02:11.000
Where are your mother and father?

02:11.083 --> 02:13.166
My mother and father
aren't around anymore.

02:18.666 --> 02:21.625
Oh, hey! You can join our family.

02:21.708 --> 02:24.416
We have lots of food.
You can eat as much as you want.

02:24.500 --> 02:27.083
Ochô! You cannot say these things out loud

02:27.166 --> 02:29.708
and certainly not to a strange child
from another planet.

02:29.791 --> 02:32.000
-Leave the poor thing alone.
-Oh, yeah?

02:32.083 --> 02:34.166
And here I thought
that everyone likes to go on

02:34.250 --> 02:37.375
about how Boss Yasaburô
always does the right thing.

02:37.458 --> 02:40.791
Besides, I can tell by looking at her
that she's a good kid, right?

02:40.875 --> 02:42.541
Let's go. Come on!

02:47.375 --> 02:49.791
Hey, this way!

02:51.166 --> 02:53.708
Look! Isn't it beautiful?

02:56.791 --> 02:59.125
Dank farrik. Look what you've done!

02:59.208 --> 03:01.875
It would be disgraceful
for me not to invite her now.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.541
-Okay, it's decided.

03:04.625 --> 03:07.041
I'll take her in as your protégée.

03:07.125 --> 03:11.541
Now we're going to make sure
you're cleaned up and well-fed, so smile.

03:19.375 --> 03:20.750
-What's the matter?

03:21.375 --> 03:23.083
Are you still worried?

03:25.625 --> 03:27.625
With a little time…

03:28.875 --> 03:31.291
we're going to become a proper family.

03:50.291 --> 03:51.541
TD!

03:57.375 --> 03:58.875
Where is my sister?

04:03.625 --> 04:05.791
What happened?

04:05.875 --> 04:09.041
Papa! What did you do?
The town's destroyed!

04:09.125 --> 04:12.166
So, this explosion was Father's doing?

04:12.250 --> 04:13.666
No way!

04:13.750 --> 04:15.041
Come on, TD!

04:16.416 --> 04:18.583
I can't believe
you attacked the Imperial base!

04:18.666 --> 04:21.541
It is the Empire who polluted our sea
and pillaged our land.

04:21.625 --> 04:24.500
I've watched the planet of my youth
be stripped and exploited,

04:24.583 --> 04:26.583
and it has to stop right now!

04:26.666 --> 04:29.000
We need to show them
we will not accept this!

04:29.083 --> 04:31.666
Please, Boss, stop arguing!
You too, my lady!

04:31.750 --> 04:34.208
We need to flee
before the Imperial troops arrive.

04:34.291 --> 04:37.916
Oh, Miss Lop! You're here.
Can you please help us make them stop?

04:38.500 --> 04:42.250
People have gotten injured,
including our own family!

04:42.333 --> 04:45.375
Ochô! And you too, Father! Please stop!

04:45.458 --> 04:47.625
-There's no reason for you both to fight.
-Enough!

04:47.708 --> 04:51.000
This is a problem for the head
of the family. You should remain silent.

04:51.083 --> 04:54.500
Then allow me to make myself clear
as the next head of family.

04:54.583 --> 04:58.166
Papa, your stubborn opposition
to development is just wrong.

04:58.250 --> 05:02.083
We need the Empire to provide growth
and prosperity for our future!

05:02.166 --> 05:05.041
We've lived a long time
without any assistance from the Republic.

05:05.125 --> 05:09.000
Why would we need to change things now?
Why throw ourselves at their feet?

05:09.083 --> 05:11.416
They continue their military buildup,

05:11.500 --> 05:13.916
but what happens if they turn this planet
into a war zone?

05:14.750 --> 05:18.416
You want to lead this family?
Then you should want to drive them out!

05:18.500 --> 05:20.875
You're not looking at the bigger picture!

05:20.958 --> 05:24.750
Without the help of the Empire,
whether there's war or no war,

05:24.833 --> 05:27.375
we will have no chance
to make any progress.

05:27.458 --> 05:30.125
The Empire provides for us
and offers support.

05:30.208 --> 05:31.541
We should be grateful.

05:31.625 --> 05:33.458
What they're providing isn't support.

05:33.541 --> 05:36.041
It's just a diplomatic way
of saying they're taking over.

05:36.125 --> 05:38.666
Why can't you
at least try to understand?

05:39.458 --> 05:41.416
Sorry, Boss! Gotta run!

05:42.458 --> 05:45.458
Hey! Why are you running away?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.125
Those fools!

05:48.208 --> 05:51.250
We have a duty that's been passed down
for generations.

05:51.333 --> 05:53.958
We need not capitulate
to the Empire and their kind.

05:54.708 --> 05:56.833
You need to open your eyes.

06:01.458 --> 06:04.166
You should really try
and understand how Father's feeling.

06:04.833 --> 06:07.541
How are feelings
supposed to save our family?

06:07.625 --> 06:10.416
He probably wouldn't understand
these kinds of things anyway.

06:10.500 --> 06:14.625
It's just that. We are family.
I want us to all stop fighting.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.916
Even though I'm originally
from a different planet,

06:18.000 --> 06:20.166
I've come to feel at home here.

06:20.250 --> 06:22.791
So I kinda understand
what Father is saying.

06:26.541 --> 06:28.041
I get it, you know?

06:28.125 --> 06:30.958
I love this planet, and I love Papa too.

06:31.625 --> 06:35.166
And as his heir, that's exactly why
I have to turn to the Empire.

06:35.250 --> 06:37.291
For the sake of our future.

06:37.375 --> 06:40.916
Papa doesn't get it, but leave it to me.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.125
I know how to take care of the household.

06:49.500 --> 06:52.708
I've been waiting for you, Ochô.
There you are.

06:54.208 --> 06:57.458
An Imperial officer?
Ochô, do you know this guy?

06:57.541 --> 06:59.541
Oh, we know each other well.

06:59.625 --> 07:03.458
I asked Ochô if she would negotiate
with her father on our behalf.

07:04.041 --> 07:06.708
Negotiate? What are you talking about?

07:06.791 --> 07:09.458
We were aware
of Yasaburô's terrorist plans,

07:09.541 --> 07:14.250
but we wanted to avoid escalation,
so we called on Ochô here to help us out.

07:14.333 --> 07:18.875
She's sensible enough to understand
the many benefits the Empire can offer.

07:18.958 --> 07:21.041
And she promised us
that she could put a stop

07:21.125 --> 07:22.958
to this foolish little insurrection,

07:23.958 --> 07:26.666
but it turns out that she was mistaken.

07:26.750 --> 07:27.833
Is this true?

07:27.916 --> 07:30.833
You tried to stop him
without even talking to Father first?

07:31.416 --> 07:34.625
Of course.
I can't leave it up to Papa anymore.

07:34.708 --> 07:36.458
He's blinded by his idealism.

07:36.541 --> 07:40.875
I'm sorry, Ochô, but if
you're unable to get them under control,

07:40.958 --> 07:44.125
we're going to have to make life
even rougher for the Yasaburô clan.

07:44.208 --> 07:46.666
But I'm sure
you of all people understand that.

07:47.916 --> 07:51.333
I apologize for what happened.
I take full responsibility.

07:51.416 --> 07:54.500
As his successor, I will persuade him.

07:54.583 --> 07:57.208
And if I can't,
I will force Papa to stop this.

07:57.291 --> 08:00.875
Determination is an admirable trait, Ochô…

08:00.958 --> 08:03.625
In fact,
since you're an ally to the Empire,

08:03.708 --> 08:07.083
why not come with us to help
with our redevelopment initiative?

08:07.166 --> 08:09.833
It's all in the best interests
of the planet.

08:09.916 --> 08:12.083
And I know that you care about its future.

08:12.166 --> 08:14.833
Together, we can bring an end
to this bloodshed.

08:16.833 --> 08:19.125
No, wait! Think about this, Ochô.

08:19.208 --> 08:21.208
You know it would break Father's heart.

08:25.791 --> 08:27.458
This isn't the way to do this!

09:26.083 --> 09:27.208
Father! Wh--

09:27.958 --> 09:29.666
W-Where did everybody go?

09:31.583 --> 09:35.625
Most of them up and ran away.
What you see is what's left.

09:35.708 --> 09:39.000
Bunch of cowards,
every single one of them.

09:39.083 --> 09:41.583
They asked for leave before they left.

09:41.666 --> 09:42.833
-Where's Ochô?

09:46.125 --> 09:49.208
She's gone too.
She's taken the Empire's side.

09:49.958 --> 09:54.166
They asked her to try to talk you out of
what they called "terrorist plans."

09:55.041 --> 09:56.958
And they said, if she couldn't stop you,

09:57.041 --> 09:59.375
they were gonna make life hard
for our clan.

10:04.291 --> 10:07.166
The thing is,
I care about this planet, Father,

10:07.750 --> 10:09.958
and I want to protect it
just as much as you.

10:10.041 --> 10:13.333
It's my home.
You and Ochô were good to me.

10:13.416 --> 10:16.125
I want the three of us
to live together again.

10:16.208 --> 10:19.416
I mean, I want to put a stop
to the Empire's oppression.

10:20.166 --> 10:22.041
And I want Ochô to come home too.

10:22.583 --> 10:25.083
So, Father, lend me your strength.

10:30.416 --> 10:31.583
Come with me.

11:00.208 --> 11:01.958
You have a good heart, Lop.

11:03.125 --> 11:08.041
I'm sorry. I never meant
to look down on you, but I think I did.

11:08.875 --> 11:15.083
So, if I ever seemed
to favor Ochô over you, I apologize.

11:46.041 --> 11:48.916
You can confirm what's happening
with your own eyes.

11:50.875 --> 11:55.375
This ritual has been passed down
in our family for generations.

11:55.458 --> 12:00.125
Hundreds of years ago now,
there was a great warrior called a Jedi,

12:00.208 --> 12:02.791
who came to this planet and died here.

12:02.875 --> 12:07.291
But first, he entrusted
this treasured sword to our ancestor.

12:07.375 --> 12:12.625
Through his teachings, this ancestor
was taught how to wield the blade,

12:12.708 --> 12:14.041
and ever since,

12:14.125 --> 12:19.166
both it and those techniques
have been passed down for generations.

12:20.250 --> 12:21.500
We're a proud family.

12:21.583 --> 12:25.875
This sword is both a symbol and proof
of our unwavering resolve.

12:25.958 --> 12:27.833
I want you to understand that.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.041
All right. Now do exactly what I tell you.

12:33.916 --> 12:38.500
This ancient weapon represents the bond
between parent and child in our family.

12:39.375 --> 12:41.416
As it is bestowed upon you,

12:41.500 --> 12:44.541
remember that,
even though we are not bound by blood,

12:44.625 --> 12:47.208
you and I share a strong connection.

12:47.291 --> 12:51.000
I am your father,
and that bond cannot be broken.

12:51.875 --> 12:55.625
We'll support each other
for as long as we are able to.

12:55.708 --> 12:59.875
Bear this in mind
and keep this sword close to your heart.

13:00.708 --> 13:02.208
Whenever you're ready.

13:03.708 --> 13:05.000
Now take it.

13:05.083 --> 13:06.625
Say you'll respectfully accept.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.083
I respectfully accept.

13:13.041 --> 13:16.416
Good.
And with that, the sword belongs to you.

13:17.083 --> 13:21.625
This might be the end of our family,
but I'm glad you're part of it.

13:21.708 --> 13:22.750
Thank you.

13:26.833 --> 13:28.958
Father! I don't like this.

13:29.041 --> 13:31.208
What will happen
to the Yasaburô household?

13:31.291 --> 13:32.750
What about Ochô?

13:32.833 --> 13:34.416
There is no household.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.041
You mustn't worry about this place now.

13:37.125 --> 13:39.791
That treasured saber of yours is
all that matters.

13:40.583 --> 13:43.125
Just remember, both you and Ochô,

13:43.208 --> 13:46.000
no matter what,
you will always be my daughters.

13:46.833 --> 13:50.041
Okay. Now stay here.

13:50.125 --> 13:52.166
Everything will be all right.

13:52.250 --> 13:54.083
I'm just going to meet her.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.750
Wait for us here. I won't be long.

13:56.833 --> 14:00.500
I know that Ochô loves you, Father.
She told me so herself.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.250
I'm glad to hear that.

14:26.083 --> 14:29.250
I have a feeling
that means the boss is in trouble.

14:34.750 --> 14:36.000
Lop, wait!

15:18.333 --> 15:22.666
Stop, Ochô! I can't bear fighting you.
I am your father!

15:22.750 --> 15:25.375
I'm sorry, but you don't understand!

15:27.625 --> 15:32.500
Yes, I do, and I have since the first time
I looked into your eyes.

15:32.583 --> 15:35.375
I'm your father,
and you're my little girl.

15:36.291 --> 15:38.416
Now, please, just come home.

15:45.750 --> 15:46.750
Lop!

15:52.041 --> 15:56.541
I'm sorry, Papa.
This isn't how I wanted this to happen.

15:56.625 --> 15:59.416
I had to. You left me no choice,

15:59.500 --> 16:01.625
and I'll do what I must
to protect our home,

16:01.708 --> 16:04.291
even if that means
I have to hurt you, Papa.

16:04.875 --> 16:06.333
Oh, no. Father!

16:06.416 --> 16:08.291
Are you okay? Say something!

16:09.291 --> 16:11.875
It's no good.

16:12.541 --> 16:14.958
I think I just lost my one good eye.

16:15.625 --> 16:18.041
Now I won't be able to see your faces.

16:19.666 --> 16:22.083
Lop, you have to do it.

16:22.166 --> 16:24.250
You have to stop your sister.

16:24.333 --> 16:26.333
Please save her.

16:26.416 --> 16:32.333
That's what a family does for each other
in difficult times. Isn't that right?

16:32.416 --> 16:35.083
This has nothing to do with her!
I'm your daughter.

16:35.166 --> 16:36.833
She's not even a part of this family.

16:37.916 --> 16:41.916
If you truly believe that,
then I failed you as a father.

16:42.458 --> 16:45.208
-I'm so sorry, Ochô.

16:46.833 --> 16:49.916
I really am. But please understand.

16:51.041 --> 16:53.166
You and Lop can join hands,

16:53.250 --> 16:57.958
and if you're together,
we can protect our homeland.

16:58.541 --> 17:00.458
What are you talking about?

17:00.541 --> 17:02.458
You know I can't turn back now!

17:02.541 --> 17:03.791
It's too late!

17:07.625 --> 17:09.541
That's the family sword.

17:09.625 --> 17:11.541
What are you doing with that?

17:12.125 --> 17:14.041
I'm the successor!

17:14.125 --> 17:16.708
I passed it on to Lop.

17:16.791 --> 17:20.083
Inheritance has nothing to do with blood.

17:20.166 --> 17:22.500
There is so much that matters more.

17:27.666 --> 17:30.916
Don't be ridiculous!
I won't allow it!

17:36.125 --> 17:38.875
Ochô, you and I are sisters.

17:38.958 --> 17:40.166
Why don't we go home?

17:40.250 --> 17:44.041
With the three of us together,
we can rebuild this family.

17:45.291 --> 17:49.125
-What is… family?
-TD!

17:54.208 --> 17:55.458
TD!

18:00.291 --> 18:01.625
I'll bring you back!

18:02.958 --> 18:06.416
My real sister! I won't give up!

18:59.458 --> 19:01.375
With a little time…

19:03.916 --> 19:06.250
…we're gonna
become a proper family.
