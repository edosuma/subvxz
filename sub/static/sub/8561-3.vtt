02:28.745 --> 02:34.830
I never thought I'd get through D-Day,
let alone the next phase.

02:35.001 --> 02:37.245
I thought I'd be killed instantly.

02:37.379 --> 02:41.246
I thought one of two things:
a quick death…

02:41.424 --> 02:44.544
or I'd come through
without a scratch.

02:44.761 --> 02:50.882
I think everybody had fear. I think
there's people that can handle fear.

02:51.059 --> 02:54.677
I think I was probably one of them.

02:54.855 --> 02:59.980
I think I was just as scared
as anybody else, except I could think.

03:00.193 --> 03:04.690
It's a feeling you would
not let yourself down…

03:04.865 --> 03:09.361
and you would not let your comrades
or your unit down.

03:09.620 --> 03:15.658
We all had fear, but we all
had training to know…

03:15.834 --> 03:18.123
you try to handle your fear…

03:18.295 --> 03:23.337
and work to accomplish
what you're supposed to be doing.

04:14.685 --> 04:17.685
Hey, it looks like what's-his-name.

04:18.898 --> 04:21.103
You know, from 1st Platoon?

04:21.274 --> 04:24.110
–Our 1st Platoon?
–It sure does.

04:31.160 --> 04:32.405
Blithe.

04:33.204 --> 04:34.912
Hey, Blithe.

04:37.166 --> 04:39.075
Blithe!

04:46.759 --> 04:50.211
Keep moving! Get down!

04:55.184 --> 04:57.722
Thought that was you.

04:59.522 --> 05:01.479
You alone?

05:03.276 --> 05:05.905
You're the first familiar faces
I've seen.

05:05.945 --> 05:10.025
I ain't surprised. They dropped us
all over the peninsula.

05:10.199 --> 05:13.818
We've been fighting with the 502nd
since we got here.

05:14.078 --> 05:15.952
You?

05:17.957 --> 05:20.413
Oh, I've been…

05:21.711 --> 05:24.961
trying to find Easy.
–Join the club.

05:35.266 --> 05:36.642
Spread out!

05:49.572 --> 05:50.817
Hey, fellas.

05:50.991 --> 05:55.202
–Look who decided to show up, Floyd.
–Hey, Luz.

05:55.370 --> 05:58.010
–Thought we'd never find you.
–You okay?

05:58.164 --> 06:00.952
–Get a load of this. Like it?
–It's real?

06:01.126 --> 06:03.795
–Of course.
–You like this?

06:03.962 --> 06:07.413
Oh, nice. That's a beauty, sarge.

06:07.591 --> 06:09.299
It's a hell of a poncho.

06:09.468 --> 06:13.382
My Luger's gonna put you all
to shame when I get it.

06:17.726 --> 06:20.134
How was your jump?

06:20.729 --> 06:24.180
–Missed the DZ.
–Yeah, that goes without saying.

06:24.358 --> 06:28.521
–I guess so.
–Got any souvenirs to trade?

06:29.863 --> 06:35.450
They're all ticking, unlike their
previous owners. Got anything good?

06:35.619 --> 06:37.197
Not yet.

06:42.668 --> 06:45.918
So have we lost anybody?

06:46.088 --> 06:50.549
Burgess took one in the face.
Wynn got pinked in the behind.

06:50.759 --> 06:53.630
–They're gonna be okay.
–That's good.

06:53.846 --> 06:57.215
–Run into Lt Meehan on your travels?
–No. Why?

06:57.391 --> 07:01.188
Company HQ's still missing.
They think the plane went down.

07:01.228 --> 07:05.178
–They say he's gonna turn up.
–I ain't holding my breath.

07:05.357 --> 07:07.813
–Who's in command?
–Winters for now.

07:07.985 --> 07:09.978
Lt Welsh is 1st Platoon.

07:10.154 --> 07:13.274
–Easy Company on the road!
–1st Platoon!

07:13.908 --> 07:17.988
–Platoon! Move out!
–On your feet. Let's go, 1st Platoon!

07:18.162 --> 07:22.623
–Easy's moving out. On your feet.
–Let's go!

07:22.958 --> 07:27.003
–Stand up, let's go! Here we go!
–Today, people!

07:27.171 --> 07:31.833
Listen! It'll be dark soon. Light
and noise discipline from here on.

07:32.218 --> 07:36.512
No talking, smoking or grab-fanny
with the man in front of you.

07:36.680 --> 07:39.800
–Where we headed to?
–We're taking Carentan.

07:40.059 --> 07:41.222
Sounds like fun.

07:41.394 --> 07:45.358
It's the only place where armor from
Omaha and Utah Beach can head inland.

07:45.398 --> 07:50.439
Until we take Carentan, they're stuck.
Taylor's sending the whole division.

07:50.611 --> 07:55.231
“Remember, boys, give me three days
and three nights of hard fighting…

07:55.283 --> 07:57.489
and you will be relieved.”

07:57.910 --> 08:00.484
Lieutenant, I'll take point.

08:00.746 --> 08:02.786
Hoobler will be lead scout.

08:03.374 --> 08:06.328
–Blithe, glad you could join us.
–Thank you.

08:06.586 --> 08:09.503
1st Platoon, fall in behind
Fox Company.

08:09.672 --> 08:14.049
2nd and 3rd Platoons, follow us.
Shake a leg.

08:14.510 --> 08:19.172
“Another thing to remember, boys:
flies spread disease.

08:19.349 --> 08:22.385
So keep yours closed.”

09:07.939 --> 09:10.477
Don't wake Jerry.

09:28.043 --> 09:30.285
–Damn it.
–What?

09:30.462 --> 09:33.961
–We lost F Company, sir.
–Again?

09:35.592 --> 09:38.463
–We lost F Company.
–Again?

09:38.637 --> 09:42.385
–Blithe, Skinny, guess what.
–Pass the word to hold up.

09:42.557 --> 09:47.682
–Take Blithe and go find F Company.
–Yes, sir. Come on, Blithe.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.491
Shit.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.960
–Did you send somebody?
–Hoobler and Blithe.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.328
Why are we stopped?

10:09.501 --> 10:13.748
This is about officers crapping out
on their training, Nix.

10:14.548 --> 10:17.632
Come on. Let's get this show
on the road.

10:21.055 --> 10:23.261
Dang mosquitoes.

10:34.777 --> 10:36.650
What is it?

10:40.032 --> 10:42.570
–Flash.
–Thunder.

10:45.871 --> 10:49.620
–I can hear you across the field.
–You F Company?

10:50.835 --> 10:52.792
That's right.

10:55.256 --> 10:56.536
Where you all been?

10:56.716 --> 11:00.416
Blithe, go tell the lieutenant
we found F Company.

11:00.678 --> 11:06.099
–I'll find out where these yokels are.
–Hey, who you calling a yokel?

11:17.695 --> 11:19.771
He's dead, private.

11:20.615 --> 11:24.612
–Did you find Fox Company?
–Yes, sir.

11:26.662 --> 11:31.040
Thought he—
I thought he had me.

11:33.294 --> 11:35.340
–Fallschirmjäger.
–Paratrooper?

11:35.797 --> 11:39.469
Division thinks there's a regiment
of them holding Carentan.

11:39.509 --> 11:42.130
Well, there's one less to worry about.

11:43.012 --> 11:44.886
That's edelweiss.

11:45.056 --> 11:48.306
That only grows in the Alps
above the tree line.

11:48.476 --> 11:53.981
He climbed up there to get it. It's
said to be the mark of a true soldier.

12:14.544 --> 12:18.425
Take the 1st straight up the middle.
We have to move quickly.

12:18.465 --> 12:21.631
I'll be right behind you
with 2nd and 3rd.

12:35.357 --> 12:39.734
–Go!
–Let's go, 1st, let's go.

12:40.195 --> 12:42.686
Go, go! Go!

12:45.951 --> 12:47.528
Fire!

12:51.373 --> 12:54.824
–In the ditch! Down! Down! Down! Down!
–Incoming!

12:59.589 --> 13:02.460
–Goddamn it.
–Where the fuck is everybody?

13:04.386 --> 13:08.300
–Where'd everybody go?
–I have no idea!

13:08.682 --> 13:13.011
Let's go, Easy!
Get those MGs moving, will you?

13:13.228 --> 13:16.198
–Get them out of there!
–They're in the open!

13:16.565 --> 13:18.604
Go! Go!

13:19.943 --> 13:22.861
Get them going, Buck!
Follow me, Easy!

13:23.447 --> 13:26.282
Move out! Move out, men!

13:26.492 --> 13:27.571
Go!

13:29.495 --> 13:32.282
Move out! Move out!

13:33.207 --> 13:35.828
Get yourselves out of that ditch!

13:36.001 --> 13:39.335
We have men getting killed
out there, Blithe!

13:40.881 --> 13:44.831
Move! You got no cover there! Go!

13:46.637 --> 13:48.760
Spotter! Upstairs window! Left!

13:50.766 --> 13:52.177
Follow me!

13:52.643 --> 13:55.015
Get out of those trenches!

13:55.854 --> 13:59.223
–Down, down, down, down!
–Incoming!

13:59.400 --> 14:01.772
That's an MG42!

14:03.279 --> 14:06.979
–Medic up!
–No! Stay down! He's shot!

14:07.199 --> 14:09.275
Get out of the dirt! Nazi!

14:23.466 --> 14:25.257
There's one in the upper—

14:27.261 --> 14:29.550
–Medic!
–Pull him back!

14:35.311 --> 14:36.889
Ah, shit!

14:40.399 --> 14:44.444
Sniper! That-away! Second floor left!

14:57.917 --> 14:59.328
Ah, shit!

15:01.671 --> 15:04.506
I need some covering fire.
Ready, Luz?

15:07.885 --> 15:10.174
Okay, I'm out.

15:17.145 --> 15:20.311
Guarnere! Clear that sector
on the right!

15:22.066 --> 15:23.347
Hey, up with me!

15:28.198 --> 15:31.033
–Shit!
–Move, Luz! Here! High!

15:31.201 --> 15:33.277
You okay, Shifty?

15:34.662 --> 15:36.738
We gotta take that warehouse!

15:38.917 --> 15:40.245
Shifty!

15:43.588 --> 15:45.664
Hammer those windows.

15:47.509 --> 15:49.751
Let's go! Move! Go! Go!

15:49.928 --> 15:53.427
Start clearing these buildings.
Two to a house.

15:55.558 --> 15:58.394
Second two. Go! Go!

16:01.022 --> 16:03.062
Houses on the right!

16:03.316 --> 16:05.108
Check them and clear them!

16:17.372 --> 16:19.994
Turn left! Bring it up!

16:28.925 --> 16:30.206
Smash it.

16:30.427 --> 16:33.463
Grenade! Luz, come on, Luz.

16:33.680 --> 16:37.132
–Come on!
–Close behind.

17:00.624 --> 17:02.249
Shit!

17:02.835 --> 17:06.251
They got us zeroed! Spread it out!
Spread it out!

17:06.422 --> 17:08.461
–They got us zeroed!
–Go now!

17:08.632 --> 17:11.835
–Get out of the street!
–Get out of there!

17:12.011 --> 17:14.502
They got us zeroed!

17:16.890 --> 17:18.763
Get out of there! Go! Go!

17:19.101 --> 17:21.638
Get the hell out of the street! Move!

17:22.061 --> 17:23.935
Let's go! Go! Go!

17:24.940 --> 17:30.065
–Take cover!
–I need a hand over here!

17:49.799 --> 17:51.459
Medic!

17:54.762 --> 17:56.920
–Move over!
–Through the window!

18:06.816 --> 18:11.644
Come on. Let's get you out of here.
Come on, boy!

18:14.365 --> 18:16.737
Move! Move! Move!

18:16.909 --> 18:20.159
Get out of the street! Go! Go!

18:27.587 --> 18:29.081
Lip!

18:33.301 --> 18:34.925
Hey, buddy.

18:43.603 --> 18:47.138
You're okay, Lip. Everything's
where it should be.

18:47.315 --> 18:49.224
Come on. Upsy-daisy.

18:51.528 --> 18:55.146
–Check up front.
–Get Tipper up here with the bazooka.

18:55.323 --> 18:59.107
–Check across the front.
–Move on one!

19:20.765 --> 19:24.181
Hello? Anybody there?

19:37.824 --> 19:40.232
Tipper! Tip!

19:41.244 --> 19:45.242
Tipper! Answer me! Tip!

19:49.044 --> 19:51.535
–Joe? That you?
–Looking good, Tip.

19:51.713 --> 19:56.126
Looking real good. Come here, buddy.
You gotta sit down. Come on.

19:56.301 --> 19:59.136
Easy, easy. There you go.
There you go.

20:05.352 --> 20:07.060
Ah, Jesus.

20:16.321 --> 20:21.114
You hang in there, buddy. We're gonna
get you fixed up, all right?

20:21.577 --> 20:25.788
Okay. Guys, you wanna give me
a hand here? Come on.

20:26.957 --> 20:30.124
Take the left flank!
Take the left flank!

20:31.629 --> 20:33.455
Got a bad one.

20:35.549 --> 20:37.542
Padre!

20:40.262 --> 20:44.018
–In the name of the Father, the Son—
–You see what I'm seeing?

20:44.058 --> 20:48.684
—is now and forever shall be,
world without end. Amen.

20:49.063 --> 20:52.847
–Crazy fools, the Irish.
–You should know.

20:57.863 --> 21:01.232
Smokey, the window. Let's go!

21:25.433 --> 21:28.220
–Morning, sir.
–What's your name, trooper?

21:28.436 --> 21:30.843
Farnsworth from Able Company,
501st.

21:31.230 --> 21:35.361
We got it clear from here all the way
to the north of them Krauts.

21:35.401 --> 21:39.269
Tell your CO 506 secured
all positions south of you.

21:39.447 --> 21:42.152
Sir, I'll tell him. Come on, let's go!

21:42.533 --> 21:44.277
Lieutenant Winters.

21:44.452 --> 21:47.702
–Yes, sir?
–Is it safe to cross now?

21:47.872 --> 21:50.659
–What's that, sir?
–Is it safe to cross?

21:50.875 --> 21:53.383
–We wanna move the wounded.
–Yes, sir.

21:53.461 --> 21:55.169
Okay.

21:58.466 --> 22:01.384
Come on. Let's get them out of here.

22:17.986 --> 22:19.445
There she is.

22:19.612 --> 22:21.486
Plasma drip.

22:22.490 --> 22:25.408
You're lucky it was a ricochet.

22:26.036 --> 22:28.412
–Just caught a piece of it.
–Stupid.

22:28.580 --> 22:29.908
–What?
–Nothing.

22:30.081 --> 22:32.323
Walking wounded to the rear.

22:32.500 --> 22:36.332
–You gonna be able to stay off it?
–Doesn't look that way.

22:36.504 --> 22:38.995
Well, you gotta try, huh?

22:39.174 --> 22:41.131
What've we got planned?

22:41.301 --> 22:43.922
Well, we expect a counterattack.

22:44.095 --> 22:46.468
Carentan's important to them.

22:46.640 --> 22:50.204
–Any idea when?
–We're not waiting around to find out.

22:50.435 --> 22:55.512
Battalion wants us to head east,
set up a defensive position.

22:55.816 --> 23:00.145
With the flooded fields,
it's the direction they'll come from.

23:00.695 --> 23:05.523
–You gonna be all right?
–Yeah.

23:07.077 --> 23:08.737
Good.

23:13.959 --> 23:16.628
What's wrong with Blithe?

23:18.213 --> 23:20.965
Well, nothing. Except he can't see.

23:21.717 --> 23:24.920
–He can't see?
–So he says.

23:42.362 --> 23:44.189
Blithe?

23:45.574 --> 23:47.650
It's Lieutenant Winters.

23:48.786 --> 23:50.196
What happened?

23:52.164 --> 23:54.073
I don't know, sir.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.701
Well, things… They just
kind of went black on me.

24:01.173 --> 24:04.340
–What, you can't see?
–Not a thing, sir.

24:04.510 --> 24:07.380
I can't see a thing.

24:09.765 --> 24:12.849
Well, you just take it easy, Blithe.

24:13.018 --> 24:16.387
I'll get you out of here.
Get you back to England.

24:18.482 --> 24:20.890
It's gonna be okay.

24:23.195 --> 24:24.855
Sir…

24:27.408 --> 24:31.904
I didn't wanna let anyone down.
–No.

24:33.664 --> 24:35.787
Just take it easy.

24:38.628 --> 24:40.537
It's okay, son.

24:51.933 --> 24:53.641
Sir?

24:56.646 --> 24:58.852
–What is it?
–Thank you, sir.

25:02.610 --> 25:04.899
I'm okay.

25:07.156 --> 25:09.694
Yeah, I'm okay.

25:09.867 --> 25:12.109
I'm okay. I think I'm okay.

25:13.204 --> 25:14.746
You can see?

25:16.249 --> 25:19.748
God, I don't know what happened.

25:20.378 --> 25:23.213
I think— I think I'm okay.

25:25.383 --> 25:27.672
All right.

25:27.844 --> 25:31.889
Well, stay a little while longer
and make sure.

25:32.056 --> 25:35.757
And then you can report
back to your platoon.

25:38.772 --> 25:40.479
Yes, sir.

25:50.992 --> 25:53.946
Now can we get that bandage on?

25:54.788 --> 25:55.867
Yeah.

25:56.831 --> 26:01.244
–Berlin by Christmas is how I see it.
–Yeah, you're full of it.

26:01.419 --> 26:06.414
Oh, God. This Kraut cheese
tastes like—

26:06.591 --> 26:09.509
–It stinks.
–Bread's stale too.

26:09.678 --> 26:11.469
Give me that.

26:11.638 --> 26:16.763
The way we came and took over? Don't
seem like Jerry's got much fight left.

26:16.935 --> 26:19.481
Don't get hit in the face when Jerry
throws in the sponge, all right?

26:19.521 --> 26:22.855
You mark my words, Mal:
Berlin by Christmas.

26:23.024 --> 26:26.191
Enjoy it while it lasts.
We're moving out soon.

26:27.029 --> 26:29.650
Out of town, lieutenant? Already?

26:29.823 --> 26:31.697
That's right.

26:38.206 --> 26:41.410
Don't they know we're just getting
settled here?

26:46.256 --> 26:47.916
Nice, Groucho.

26:48.091 --> 26:50.380
–What?
–Real smart.

26:50.594 --> 26:54.212
You're taking your life
in your own hands. Right?

26:54.640 --> 26:56.597
I told you. I didn't see it.

26:56.850 --> 27:00.564
What, Speirs shooting the prisoners,
or the sergeant in his own platoon?

27:00.604 --> 27:03.574
–I didn't hear that!
–He shot one of his own?

27:03.732 --> 27:06.769
Supposedly, the guy refused
to go on a patrol.

27:07.194 --> 27:08.937
Who knows if it's true?

27:09.947 --> 27:11.939
Well, I know a guy…

27:12.116 --> 27:16.493
who said an eyewitness told him
Speirs hosed those prisoners.

27:16.662 --> 27:18.951
Why? What for?

27:19.707 --> 27:21.580
On D-Day.

27:22.001 --> 27:26.378
Speirs comes across these Kraut
prisoners digging a hole…

27:26.630 --> 27:28.837
under guard and all.

27:29.008 --> 27:32.673
He breaks out a pack of smokes,
passes them out.

27:32.845 --> 27:35.680
He even gives them a light.

27:37.683 --> 27:41.266
Then, all of a sudden,
he swings up his Thompson and:

27:42.938 --> 27:44.896
He hoses them.

27:48.361 --> 27:49.559
I mean, goddamn!

27:50.196 --> 27:52.947
He gives them smokes first⁈

27:53.366 --> 27:56.534
–That's why I don't think he did it.
–You don't?

27:56.661 --> 27:57.941
I heard he didn't.

28:06.796 --> 28:08.512
No, it was him, all right.

28:09.131 --> 28:12.049
But it was more than eight.
More like 20.

28:17.098 --> 28:18.972
Hell of a shot.

28:19.892 --> 28:24.222
All except one guy,
who he left alone.

28:25.022 --> 28:31.357
From what I heard, he took that last
105 on D-Day practically by himself.

28:31.529 --> 28:33.818
–That I saw.
–On his own?

28:34.073 --> 28:37.158
I don't care if any
of the other stuff's true.

28:37.327 --> 28:41.276
–Grab your smokes and gear.
–What do you think?

28:41.456 --> 28:43.033
I don't know.

28:43.207 --> 28:46.541
Gonna take everybody's word.
I didn't see it.

28:46.711 --> 28:50.839
Let's go! 1st Platoon! Weapons on me.
We're moving out.

28:51.007 --> 28:55.135
On your feet! Tactical columns!
Flankers out!

28:55.303 --> 28:57.296
Flanks up!

28:57.472 --> 29:01.683
–That means you, Private Blithe.
–Come on, bud. Get up.

29:02.685 --> 29:04.808
You want the bread?

29:24.499 --> 29:26.990
Hey, Luz.
How far are we going?

29:27.168 --> 29:32.293
Oh, Jesus Christ, Frank. I don't know.
Until they tell us to stop.

29:32.549 --> 29:36.463
High ground. There's high ground
up ahead.

29:36.636 --> 29:39.210
Okay, genius.
Answer me this then:

29:39.473 --> 29:44.467
Why is Easy the only company who's
either at the front of an advance…

29:44.644 --> 29:47.729
or, like now, exposed
at the edge of the line?

29:47.939 --> 29:50.810
–To keep you on your toes.
–No.

29:51.068 --> 29:53.523
We're never in the middle…

29:53.695 --> 29:56.862
and we're the fifth of nine
of this regiment.

29:57.032 --> 30:01.195
–Able through Item. Think of it.
–See there? You see that—

30:02.496 --> 30:03.694
Incoming!

30:05.123 --> 30:07.793
Contact right! Get in the hedgerow!

30:13.632 --> 30:15.423
See what I mean⁈

30:17.845 --> 30:19.921
Bring it around!

30:23.434 --> 30:26.055
Right there!
Sergeant More! Stay low!

30:26.270 --> 30:31.347
Luz, get down here with the radio!
Sergeant More! On me!

30:35.029 --> 30:37.354
Go, go, go!

31:15.194 --> 31:18.112
What have they got to sing about?

31:20.366 --> 31:21.908
Flash!

31:22.910 --> 31:24.702
Thunder.

31:25.246 --> 31:27.571
Catchy tune, ain't it?

31:27.832 --> 31:32.458
–Hey, lieutenant. What's the news?
–Same as it was this afternoon.

31:33.087 --> 31:37.311
–They're in their hedge, we're in ours.
–Spell me a minute, sir?

31:38.009 --> 31:40.304
You gonna let Blithe get some sleep?

31:40.344 --> 31:43.548
–My back teeth are floating.
–Get back ASAP.

31:43.806 --> 31:45.929
You can count on me, sir.

31:57.111 --> 31:59.602
How you doing, Blithe?

31:59.781 --> 32:01.773
I'm okay, sir.

32:02.242 --> 32:05.408
What happened
at the aid station today?

32:06.579 --> 32:12.036
Doc Roe, he called it
hysterical blindness.

32:14.420 --> 32:16.746
No, thank you, sir.

32:16.923 --> 32:22.130
You know what they said in basic:
Dehydration's a soldier's worst enemy.

32:22.303 --> 32:23.846
Here.

32:29.060 --> 32:33.853
It's a game, Blithe. That's all.
We're—

32:34.899 --> 32:38.980
Hell, we're just moving the ball
forward one yard at a time.

32:39.154 --> 32:41.692
Nothing but a game.

32:44.200 --> 32:45.481
What is, sir?

32:46.703 --> 32:50.286
This. The whole thing.

32:51.500 --> 32:54.251
No. Thank you, sir.

32:54.878 --> 32:56.917
Just a game.

32:57.839 --> 32:59.168
Harry.

33:11.311 --> 33:15.439
S2 said the Germans only left
a company to defend Carentan.

33:15.607 --> 33:21.277
–The rest pulled out last night.
–I knew that town was too easy.

33:23.615 --> 33:26.153
They regrouped south of town.

33:26.326 --> 33:30.624
May have been going to a counterattack
when we ran into them here.

33:30.664 --> 33:32.822
Strength unknown.

33:36.003 --> 33:38.209
They want the town back.

33:39.214 --> 33:40.874
And we're in their way.

33:41.133 --> 33:46.009
If they don't come before then,
we're attacking at first light, 0530.

33:46.180 --> 33:48.718
I'll tell the men to fix bayonets.

33:50.517 --> 33:53.055
Not much of a limp.

33:53.687 --> 33:56.143
–I'll survive.
–How is it?

33:57.024 --> 33:58.732
Hurts.

33:59.735 --> 34:01.562
War is hell.

34:19.088 --> 34:21.164
Smith, wake up.

34:22.257 --> 34:25.212
Come on, Smith. Get up.
It's your watch.

34:25.386 --> 34:27.010
It's your watch.

34:27.471 --> 34:30.306
Easy, Smith. It's me, Talbert!

34:31.308 --> 34:34.096
What are you doing⁈
That's Talbert!

34:34.353 --> 34:36.097
–I didn't—
–Goddamn!

34:37.940 --> 34:39.684
–Gosh!
–Medic!

34:39.942 --> 34:43.311
I didn't mean to.
He looked like a Kraut.

34:43.487 --> 34:45.895
–Can you breathe?
–I can breathe.

34:46.072 --> 34:48.317
–Look at me.
–Yeah, I can breathe!

34:48.492 --> 34:50.449
You're gonna be fine.

35:01.881 --> 35:04.586
What the hell is that?

35:05.968 --> 35:09.420
Sounds like it's coming
from 3rd Platoon.

35:10.932 --> 35:13.601
Don't you wanna get some sleep?

35:14.394 --> 35:18.438
I don't think—
I don't think I can.

35:18.940 --> 35:21.513
Then go take a look.

35:57.937 --> 36:01.353
–Flash.
–Thunder. Thunder!

36:01.650 --> 36:03.975
Lieutenant Speirs, sir.

36:04.152 --> 36:06.477
Where you going, private?

36:06.655 --> 36:09.359
Check out the noise, sir.

36:09.533 --> 36:13.067
I just came from there.
Everything's under control.

36:19.292 --> 36:22.744
Got some nervous privates
in your company.

36:22.921 --> 36:24.664
We do, sir.

36:24.840 --> 36:27.591
Yeah, we do. I can vouch for that.

36:27.759 --> 36:31.175
They just don't see how simple it is.

36:33.849 --> 36:37.182
How simple what is, sir?

36:44.568 --> 36:47.569
Just do what you have to do.

36:48.780 --> 36:51.781
Like you did on D-Day, sir?

36:53.577 --> 36:55.201
Lieutenant…

36:57.247 --> 37:03.997
Sir, when I landed on D-Day, I found
myself in a ditch all by myself.

37:05.923 --> 37:07.962
I fell asleep.

37:09.051 --> 37:14.425
I think it was the air-sickness pills
they gave us.

37:17.935 --> 37:23.522
When I woke up, I didn't
really try to find my unit…

37:24.316 --> 37:26.190
to fight.

37:26.944 --> 37:28.568
I just—

37:31.532 --> 37:34.616
I just kind of stayed put.

37:36.871 --> 37:39.409
What's your name, trooper?

37:40.499 --> 37:43.073
Blithe, sir. Albert Blithe.

37:46.046 --> 37:49.498
You know why you hid in that ditch,
Blithe?

37:49.675 --> 37:51.300
I was scared.

37:52.261 --> 37:54.930
We were all scared.

37:58.225 --> 38:02.722
You hid because you think
there's still hope. But, Blithe…

38:02.897 --> 38:06.977
the only hope you have is to accept
that you're already dead.

38:07.318 --> 38:13.487
The sooner you accept that, the sooner
you'll function as you're supposed to.

38:13.658 --> 38:18.818
Without mercy. Without compassion.
Without remorse.

38:19.080 --> 38:22.283
All war depends upon it.

38:39.225 --> 38:42.428
Got any smokes? You want
some of this candy? No?

38:42.604 --> 38:44.477
The outpost got ammo.

38:44.647 --> 38:47.981
–Here you go.
–We don't know what they've got.

38:48.151 --> 38:51.650
They may be a weaker force,
maybe more paratroopers.

38:51.821 --> 38:54.905
–You know how they can be.
–Fire and maneuver.

38:55.158 --> 38:57.787
That's the name of the game:
Fire and maneuver.

38:57.827 --> 39:02.738
Dog and Fox companies will be on
our left flank with us. Any questions?

39:05.168 --> 39:08.952
–Let's make them holler.
–It's 9:30 at night back home.

39:09.130 --> 39:10.708
–Must be—
–Mortar!

39:10.882 --> 39:14.417
–Incoming! Everybody in the hole!
–Take cover!

39:16.721 --> 39:18.465
Down, down, down, down!

39:18.723 --> 39:20.597
Get that OP in!

39:21.226 --> 39:23.218
Tell them to hold.

39:23.395 --> 39:26.514
All Easy stations.
Easy 6, hold in position.

39:26.731 --> 39:28.854
Go! Lock and load!

39:34.281 --> 39:36.024
–Easy Red 6!
–Medic!

39:36.199 --> 39:41.360
I've got mortars across my line.
No infantry yet. I'm pulling the OP in.

39:42.038 --> 39:45.573
Right stake plus 15. Charge three!

39:45.751 --> 39:47.245
Range, 600.

39:47.878 --> 39:50.333
Load! Fire!

39:50.756 --> 39:54.255
Up and load! Fire!

39:58.305 --> 40:01.092
–Come on!
–Come on! Move it! Hurry!

40:04.895 --> 40:07.647
Watch for silhouettes on the horizon!

40:08.023 --> 40:10.940
Find your target. Muzzle fire!

40:11.568 --> 40:16.029
–Nail it! Keep low!
–Watch the horizon!

40:16.281 --> 40:18.653
Keep low! Go! Go! Go!

40:19.326 --> 40:21.947
Perconte!

40:22.454 --> 40:25.206
Get your men in order!
Stay low.

40:25.374 --> 40:28.541
Pour it on them, Perconte!
To your left!

40:28.794 --> 40:30.917
Keep going! Keep going!

40:31.171 --> 40:32.713
Keep it up!

40:33.882 --> 40:36.753
I want fire superiority!

40:37.011 --> 40:41.139
Guarnere, keep them pinned down!
Keep firing!

40:42.016 --> 40:46.179
Sergeants, reverse! Cover the crest
of that hill!

40:55.821 --> 40:57.565
No!

40:57.740 --> 41:00.112
No!

41:20.554 --> 41:22.880
Where the hell did they come from?

41:29.855 --> 41:32.393
Okay, pull back!

41:34.235 --> 41:36.904
Holy shit! There goes our left flank!

41:37.155 --> 41:40.239
–Sir, Dog and Fox are pulling back.
–What?

41:44.871 --> 41:46.614
Who gave that order⁈

41:54.630 --> 41:56.540
Keep firing! Stay low!

41:56.966 --> 41:59.173
Stay low. Keep firing, Perconte!

42:01.554 --> 42:04.804
Come on, Blithe. Stand up!

42:05.016 --> 42:07.803
Get up on your feet, soldier.

42:08.061 --> 42:09.769
Get up, Blithe.

42:11.314 --> 42:14.849
That's right, Blithe. You can do it.

42:17.111 --> 42:19.603
Fire your weapon, Blithe.

42:19.781 --> 42:22.616
Hit those goddamn Germans, Blithe!

42:22.784 --> 42:24.907
Rip it at them, Blithe!

42:36.631 --> 42:39.917
Keep firing! Let them have it!

42:40.093 --> 42:43.213
Keep firing! Don't slack it off!

42:43.471 --> 42:45.381
Let them have it, Blithe!

42:47.475 --> 42:50.227
Pour it on them, Blithe!

42:50.395 --> 42:53.598
The left flank! Watch your left flank!

42:55.317 --> 42:56.479
Fire!

42:58.695 --> 43:00.273
Fire!

43:00.489 --> 43:05.530
Krauts over there!
Keep the line of fire up here! Move it!

43:11.958 --> 43:13.785
Blaze spray!

43:15.379 --> 43:20.290
Let's go, McGrath! On me!
Shift your fire right!

43:23.845 --> 43:25.968
Down! Down!

43:33.230 --> 43:34.808
Get together!

43:36.692 --> 43:40.025
Come on! You're gonna get me killed,
lieutenant.

43:42.531 --> 43:45.485
I knew you'd get me killed!

43:47.411 --> 43:50.032
–Wait until I tell you!
–I can't!

43:50.289 --> 43:53.076
–Hold your fire!
–No, that's too close.

43:53.250 --> 43:55.741
–Bitch! Son of a bitch!
–Too close!

44:09.433 --> 44:10.892
Medic!

44:11.644 --> 44:13.138
Come on!

44:14.480 --> 44:16.556
Now fire, McGrath! Fire!

44:18.108 --> 44:19.733
–Yeah!
–Yeah!

44:24.990 --> 44:27.612
–Covering fire!
–Covering fire!

44:27.868 --> 44:30.620
–Keep firing south!
–Fire!

44:30.788 --> 44:32.496
You hit a home run, huh?

44:35.876 --> 44:38.546
–Smith, I've been hit!
–I got you!

44:38.796 --> 44:40.124
Get me out of here!

44:46.053 --> 44:47.251
Medic!

44:49.015 --> 44:50.129
Randleman!

44:52.226 --> 44:54.468
You okay?
Move it! Move it!

45:04.572 --> 45:06.826
–Rounds complete!
–Rounds complete!

45:06.866 --> 45:10.449
–Skip! More ammo! Go! Go!
–I'm on my way!

45:11.245 --> 45:12.656
Medic!

45:12.830 --> 45:15.119
Medic!

45:28.721 --> 45:30.963
Jesus, what was that?

45:34.435 --> 45:36.013
Shermans!

45:37.772 --> 45:39.931
Well, hello, 2nd Armored.

45:47.115 --> 45:49.487
That's right, you sorry asses! Run!

45:49.743 --> 45:53.112
The cavalry! Come on in!
The tanks!

45:53.371 --> 45:56.621
Oh, you beautiful babies, you!

46:00.879 --> 46:04.923
Let's go! Pour it on them!
Let them have it! Come on!

46:11.097 --> 46:13.635
–Look! Shermans!
–About damn time.

46:29.825 --> 46:31.070
Come on!

47:13.243 --> 47:14.951
Come on.

47:16.705 --> 47:18.614
Come on.

48:10.635 --> 48:12.343
Hey, buddy.

48:12.511 --> 48:15.049
Hey, buddy, you okay?

48:15.306 --> 48:18.592
Looks like you fellas
had a heck of a fight.

48:36.035 --> 48:39.451
Move forward on the right flank.

50:38.701 --> 50:41.156
We need to know what's in there.

50:41.328 --> 50:44.495
–I don't know who to send.
–Ask for volunteers.

50:45.124 --> 50:47.531
I hate asking for volunteers.

50:47.710 --> 50:50.283
Then pick them.

50:50.963 --> 50:54.664
Need to take a look at that farmhouse.
Who wants to go?

51:01.849 --> 51:03.509
I'll go.

51:03.684 --> 51:06.009
Anybody else?

51:07.897 --> 51:10.898
Martin, Dukeman, you just volunteered.

51:12.276 --> 51:14.185
I'll be the lead.

51:14.361 --> 51:17.481
Blithe's lead scout. Move out.

51:29.377 --> 51:33.588
Harry, what exactly are you doing
with your reserve chute?

51:33.756 --> 51:39.095
–You been hauling it since we jumped?
–Gonna send it to Kitty from England.

51:45.101 --> 51:49.763
Silk. It'll make a good wedding dress,
what with rationing and all.

51:56.446 --> 52:00.526
–I never would have guessed.
–What? That I'm so sentimental?

52:00.783 --> 52:03.784
That you think we'll make it
back to England.

52:27.936 --> 52:29.763
Okay.

52:31.606 --> 52:35.189
Here we go again. Covering fire!
Covering fire!

52:35.443 --> 52:36.985
Go! Go!

52:41.157 --> 52:43.399
Come on!
Hang in there, Blithe.

52:43.618 --> 52:45.326
Keep moving! Down!

52:46.454 --> 52:49.372
–Medic up!
–Top window right!

52:51.710 --> 52:52.824
Hang in there.

52:54.170 --> 52:57.954
Medic! We need a medic down here!

52:58.466 --> 53:00.673
Cease fire! Cease fire!

53:00.927 --> 53:05.636
Take it easy, Blithe. Take it easy.
Come on, Duke. Come on.

53:05.891 --> 53:08.097
Coming through. Give me room.

53:08.727 --> 53:11.300
Get out of my way. I got it.

53:13.190 --> 53:15.266
–What happened?
–Sniper.

53:16.401 --> 53:18.975
All right, I got you. Nice and easy.

53:19.154 --> 53:21.906
They're pulling us off the front line.

53:22.074 --> 53:23.817
Now?

53:24.159 --> 53:27.113
To a field camp north of Utah Beach.

53:27.287 --> 53:29.825
Hot food and showers.

53:31.208 --> 53:33.663
Then back to England.

53:39.883 --> 53:44.261
–Where's medical supply?
–Third tent on the right.

54:06.619 --> 54:08.196
Harry.

54:10.789 --> 54:15.997
–How's the leg?
–Stiff. Sore.

54:17.046 --> 54:20.711
–They want me to take it easy.
–Yeah, you should.

54:21.717 --> 54:24.255
Talked to Colonel Sink.

54:25.930 --> 54:29.180
Said he appreciated Easy
holding the line.

54:30.267 --> 54:33.850
Said General Taylor was pleased.

54:34.563 --> 54:40.068
That's why I came to France,
to please General Taylor.

54:41.028 --> 54:42.439
Yeah.

54:52.081 --> 54:55.843
In acknowledgment of the blood
shed serving your country…

54:56.002 --> 55:00.711
it is my honor to present you
with the Order of the Purple Heart.

55:02.758 --> 55:04.632
Thank you, sir.

55:17.065 --> 55:18.808
How many does that make?

55:19.192 --> 55:21.765
Two? Three?

55:22.278 --> 55:26.442
–You have no shame.
–Hey, I got one hole in my shoulder…

55:26.616 --> 55:29.996
a second in my calf.
Then there's the boil on my shin.

55:30.036 --> 55:32.609
And he only gets one.

55:59.858 --> 56:03.440
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

56:04.195 --> 56:06.022
This is great!

56:38.021 --> 56:41.722
–She fancied me, Alton.
–In your dreams, buddy.

56:42.192 --> 56:44.564
–Whoa! Jesus!
–Jesus!

56:54.830 --> 56:56.538
It's good to be alive!

57:03.297 --> 57:06.962
–Jesus Christ, that sure was close.
–Missed by a mile.

57:07.509 --> 57:10.961
Hey, Bull, come over here.
Bull, come over here.

57:11.138 --> 57:13.925
–I got a seat for you.
–Hey, Hoobler.

57:14.099 --> 57:16.673
–Be quiet.
–“The Night of the Bayonet.”

57:16.894 --> 57:21.935
The night was filled with dark and cold
When Sgt Talbert, the story's told

57:22.024 --> 57:24.313
I don't like this.

57:24.485 --> 57:26.857
Pulled on his poncho and headed out

57:27.029 --> 57:30.279
To check the lines
Dressed like a Kraut

57:30.491 --> 57:33.860
Why is everyone in such a hurry
to get back, huh?

57:34.036 --> 57:35.827
We don't need you anymore.

57:36.288 --> 57:40.749
Upon a trooper our hero came
Fast asleep, he called his name

57:40.960 --> 57:47.080
“Smith, oh, Smith! Get up! It's time
To take your turn out on the line.”

57:47.550 --> 57:52.591
–Do you know what he's talking about?
–The night of the bayonet.

57:53.389 --> 57:56.018
–Whatever that is.
–But Smith, so very weary

57:56.058 --> 57:58.596
Cracked an eye, all red and bleary

57:58.769 --> 58:03.396
Grabbed his rifle, he did not tarry
Hearing Floyd, but seeing Jerry

58:03.566 --> 58:07.065
–Oh, my God.
–Way to go, Smithy!

58:07.320 --> 58:12.147
“It's me”, cried Tab, “Don't do it!”
And yet Smith charged, with bayonet

58:12.325 --> 58:15.246
–He lunged, he thrust, high and low
–Come on!

58:15.286 --> 58:18.406
And skewered the boy from Kokomo

58:18.581 --> 58:21.416
I'm heading back to barracks.

58:22.752 --> 58:24.543
–You Heffron?
–Yeah.

58:24.879 --> 58:27.204
–Where you from?
–Who's asking?

58:27.381 --> 58:30.252
–You from Philadelphia?
–South Philly.

58:31.552 --> 58:33.759
I could tell.

58:33.930 --> 58:37.678
–Seventeenth Street.
–Yeah? Front Street.

58:38.184 --> 58:40.058
Come here. Sit down.

58:40.228 --> 58:44.640
–Know a guy named Johnny Waylon?
–Yeah, I know Johnny.

58:45.066 --> 58:48.684
Since you didn't qualify
for a Purple Heart…

58:49.237 --> 58:52.440
we've taken matters
into our own hands.

58:53.074 --> 58:55.530
Tab, this is for you.

58:58.580 --> 59:00.453
–A souvenir.
–That's right.

59:00.999 --> 59:04.948
–Congratulations!
–I could have shot him a dozen times.

59:05.211 --> 59:08.378
I just didn't think we could
spare a man.

59:16.848 --> 59:19.256
Couple of announcements, men.

59:19.434 --> 59:21.592
First— Listen up.

59:21.811 --> 59:27.482
First, the training exercise scheduled
for 2200 has been cancelled.

59:28.943 --> 59:30.521
Secondly…

59:30.695 --> 59:33.530
all passes are hereby revoked.

59:33.698 --> 59:36.902
We're heading back to France,
so pack your gear.

59:37.410 --> 59:40.411
We will not be returning
to England, boys.

59:40.580 --> 59:44.827
Anyone who has not made out a will,
go to the supply office.

59:45.585 --> 59:49.204
Trucks depart from Membury at 0700.

59:49.714 --> 59:52.003
As you were.

59:57.764 --> 59:59.472
Hello?

01:00:01.059 --> 01:00:02.340
Hello?

01:00:03.437 --> 01:00:06.316
Good morning, Mrs Lamb.
Sorry to be so early.

01:00:06.356 --> 01:00:08.930
–That's all right, private…?
–Malarkey.

01:00:08.942 --> 01:00:12.109
–Come in.
–Actually, it's Sgt Malarkey now.

01:00:12.279 --> 01:00:14.651
–I just got promoted.
–Oh, lovely.

01:00:14.823 --> 01:00:19.200
I expect you want your laundry.
I heard the trucks all night.

01:00:19.411 --> 01:00:23.195
–The Yanks must be off again.
–For good this time.

01:00:23.582 --> 01:00:26.038
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:33.294
Two shirts, two pairs of trousers.
Two Bob and tuppence, please.

01:00:34.176 --> 01:00:35.754
I can't—

01:00:37.763 --> 01:00:39.222
Thank you.

01:00:41.934 --> 01:00:45.469
Would you like a cup of tea?
The water's boiling.

01:00:45.646 --> 01:00:48.766
No. No, thank you.
I'm in a hell of a—

01:00:48.941 --> 01:00:53.519
Bit of a hurry.
But thank you anyway.

01:00:53.988 --> 01:00:57.107
–Oh, private?
–Yes, ma'am?

01:00:57.575 --> 01:01:00.659
Lieutenant Meehan's one of yours,
isn't he?

01:01:00.828 --> 01:01:04.078
I hope he hasn't forgotten
his laundry.

01:01:09.545 --> 01:01:13.210
–I'll take it.
–Thank you.

01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:28.767
You couldn't be a dear and help me
with a few others, could you?

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:31.065
Uh, let's see.

01:01:31.442 --> 01:01:37.065
Sergeant Evans, Private Moya,
Blowzer…

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:40.110
Gray, Miller…

01:01:41.953 --> 01:01:43.530
Owen…

01:01:44.789 --> 01:01:47.825
Collins, Elliot…

01:01:48.626 --> 01:01:50.204
Blithe.

09:00:00.000 --> 09:00:01.000
