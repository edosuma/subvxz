02:15.408 --> 02:17.507
Luri Karpachev.

02:17.508 --> 02:20.735
He was a high-level arms dealer
with links to the Mafia.

02:20.842 --> 02:21.941
Your ex-wife...

02:21.942 --> 02:26.068
I'd appreciate it if you'd refer
to Irina Derevko by name.

02:27.642 --> 02:31.369
Derevko listed him among former
contacts when she was debriefed.

02:31.509 --> 02:32.942
I've heard the name.

02:32.943 --> 02:35.342
Sloane had dealings with him
at SD-6.

02:35.343 --> 02:38.036
I'll talk to Irina.
See what she knows.

02:38.143 --> 02:40.342
Sorry about that.

02:40.343 --> 02:42.843
Don't be silly.

02:44.677 --> 02:46.576
After you turned yourself in,

02:46.577 --> 02:50.031
you listed Luri Karpachev
as one of your former contacts.

02:50.144 --> 02:53.405
He was murdered yesterday,
we believe by Sloane.

02:53.511 --> 02:56.477
Karpachev's body was found
without his wallet.

02:56.578 --> 02:59.601
Presumably Sloane has
more insidious ways to pass time

02:59.711 --> 03:01.710
than picking someone's pocket.

03:01.711 --> 03:04.541
What might he have been
looking for?

03:04.678 --> 03:06.677
Why haven't you tried
to convince Sydney

03:06.678 --> 03:09.178
to leave the CIA?

03:10.445 --> 03:13.377
You and I know better
than anyone.

03:13.512 --> 03:16.376
She should leave this life
while she has the chance.

03:16.479 --> 03:18.177
Sydney can be stubborn.

03:18.178 --> 03:21.235
Where she got that from
is anyone's guess.

03:21.346 --> 03:24.107
But she refuses to resign
as long as Sloane is free.

03:24.213 --> 03:26.906
Which brings me back
to my question.

03:27.013 --> 03:29.877
What was in Karpachev's wallet?

03:29.979 --> 03:32.479
A key card to his home safe.

03:32.513 --> 03:34.612
In '93...

03:34.613 --> 03:38.670
Karpachev came into possession
of a Rambaldi manuscript.

03:38.813 --> 03:41.313
Sloane must believe he kept it
in his safe.

03:41.447 --> 03:42.580
But he's incorrect.

03:42.581 --> 03:44.313
- Karpachev sold it.
- To whom?

03:44.314 --> 03:45.813
Ilya Stuka.

03:45.814 --> 03:48.314
A former contact of mine
living in Bangkok.

03:48.414 --> 03:50.747
What is this manuscript?

03:50.748 --> 03:53.305
Rambaldi's study
of the human heart.

03:53.414 --> 03:58.971
As you know, immortality was one
of Rambaldi's obsessions.

03:59.081 --> 04:00.714
Where does Stuka keep it?

04:00.715 --> 04:02.214
I don't know.

04:02.215 --> 04:06.806
But I could find out if I were
allowed to meet with him.

04:07.648 --> 04:11.307
Kendall won't risk letting you,
despite your cooperation.

04:11.448 --> 04:13.948
What if the prize were worth it?

04:15.516 --> 04:18.175
Sloane doesn't know
that you're in CIA custody.

04:18.281 --> 04:19.714
He thinks I'm in hiding.

04:19.716 --> 04:21.749
If Sloane believes
you've surfaced,

04:21.750 --> 04:24.511
obtained the manuscript
he's after,

04:24.616 --> 04:27.082
he'll want to meet with you
and negotiate.

04:27.083 --> 04:28.383
I'd be happy to.

04:28.384 --> 04:29.949
We could grab him.

04:29.950 --> 04:33.007
And give Sydney her reason
to get out.

04:40.617 --> 04:42.349
Okay.

04:42.350 --> 04:44.117
The key is balance, right?

04:44.118 --> 04:46.484
So don't worry so much
about the puck.

04:46.485 --> 04:49.144
Just make sure your feet
are planted on the ice.

04:49.284 --> 04:50.916
Just a nice follow-through.

04:50.917 --> 04:53.417
- Show-off.
- Yeah, a little bit.

05:01.252 --> 05:04.184
Bristow's got the puck.
She crosses the blue line!

05:04.285 --> 05:05.817
She shoots, she scores!

05:05.818 --> 05:08.784
What? Oh, my God!
What was that?

05:08.886 --> 05:11.386
I didn't say I was
completely incompetent.

05:11.452 --> 05:13.284
- You've done this before.
- No.

05:13.285 --> 05:15.085
I haven't skated since I was 5.

05:15.086 --> 05:17.586
Swear to God.
My mother took me.

05:23.220 --> 05:25.720
Well, you're better
than you should be.

05:28.387 --> 05:30.944
Sooner or later,
we have to have a conversation

05:31.054 --> 05:32.686
about my mother.

05:32.687 --> 05:35.914
There's nothing to say.
We both know what happened.

05:36.021 --> 05:37.520
What is there to say?

05:37.521 --> 05:40.021
I think a lot.

05:40.788 --> 05:43.288
Nothing I want to talk about.

05:44.855 --> 05:47.377
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

05:47.488 --> 05:49.487
Don't ever be sorry for her.

05:54.122 --> 05:56.952
Hello? Yeah.

05:57.055 --> 05:59.555
Okay.

06:01.355 --> 06:03.287
I have to go in.

06:03.288 --> 06:05.788
Of course you do.
It's your day off.

06:07.522 --> 06:10.022
All right.
I'll see you later.

06:17.456 --> 06:19.956
Yeah?

06:21.090 --> 06:23.356
My name is Sydney Bristow.
You asked for me.

06:23.357 --> 06:25.914
Yeah.
Have a seat.

06:32.324 --> 06:35.484
First, I'm gonna need
your thumbprint here

06:35.591 --> 06:37.390
and here, please.

06:37.391 --> 06:39.556
These are confidentiality
agreements.

06:39.557 --> 06:43.455
They forbid you from disclosing
anything we talk about today.

06:43.558 --> 06:46.490
If you do so, it's a felony.

07:06.059 --> 07:08.559
Thank you.

07:10.027 --> 07:14.891
Are you familiar with the name
Vladimir Pograski?

07:14.993 --> 07:17.493
No, I'm not.

07:23.460 --> 07:25.960
Ever see this man?

07:27.961 --> 07:30.461
No.

07:31.228 --> 07:34.625
Last month you were in France
with Agent Michael Vaughn.

07:34.762 --> 07:37.922
Do you recall seeing him
use the pay phone?

07:38.628 --> 07:39.727
No.

07:39.728 --> 07:41.794
Did you see Mr. Vaughn
purchase cigarettes?

07:41.795 --> 07:44.386
Mr. Vaughn doesn't smoke.

07:44.495 --> 07:46.995
I understand.

07:47.195 --> 07:49.428
No, I didn't see him
buy cigarettes.

07:49.429 --> 07:52.327
Are you and Mr. Vaughn
intimately involved?

07:52.429 --> 07:54.428
That's none of your business.

07:54.429 --> 07:56.728
Yeah, I know.
It's an awkward question.

07:56.729 --> 08:00.092
What is this about?
I'd appreciate a little context.

08:00.196 --> 08:02.029
You haven't given me your name.

08:02.030 --> 08:03.195
I'm Mitchell Yeager.

08:03.196 --> 08:05.596
Counterintelligence
threat analyst.

08:05.597 --> 08:07.763
That should give you
a little context.

08:07.764 --> 08:11.560
I've been sent here
to investigate Michael Vaughn.

08:11.663 --> 08:14.686
It's come to our attention
that over the past three months,

08:14.797 --> 08:16.295
Mr. Vaughn has been in contact

08:16.296 --> 08:19.591
with a number of unapproved
foreign operatives.

08:19.697 --> 08:24.026
He's also actively pursuing
contact with Mr. Pograski,

08:24.131 --> 08:26.858
who happens to be
a former KGB assassin

08:26.964 --> 08:30.657
known to have ties with at least
three terrorist organizations.

08:30.765 --> 08:34.356
There absolutely is a reason
for this.

08:34.464 --> 08:36.164
Yeah.
I'm sure that's right.

08:36.164 --> 08:38.530
This is crazy.
What are you saying?

08:38.532 --> 08:41.623
That Agent Vaughn is working
for someone else?

08:41.765 --> 08:45.596
Mr. Vaughn doesn't know an
investigation is taking place.

08:45.699 --> 08:47.164
And I will remind you

08:47.165 --> 08:50.325
that speaking to him about this
is not only a criminal act,

08:50.432 --> 08:54.592
but will force us to consider
you as a suspect as well.

08:54.699 --> 08:57.065
So I'll ask you again.

08:57.066 --> 09:00.293
Are you and Mr. Vaughn intimate?

09:13.034 --> 09:15.534
You suggest that we allow
Irina Derevko,

09:15.569 --> 09:18.034
a terrorist,
to make contact with Sloane?

09:18.134 --> 09:20.100
Sloane is searching
for another manuscript.

09:20.101 --> 09:21.833
Irina believes it's
in the possession

09:21.834 --> 09:23.433
of an associate in Bangkok.

09:23.434 --> 09:24.733
I'll serve as her escort.

09:24.734 --> 09:27.200
We'll recover the manuscript
and use it to bait Sloane.

09:27.201 --> 09:29.701
I doubt I'll be able
to convince Washington.

09:29.801 --> 09:32.733
Our intel would have to be
convincingly precise.

09:32.835 --> 09:35.335
All we know
about this manuscript

09:35.402 --> 09:36.801
comes only from Derevko.

09:36.802 --> 09:39.893
We may never have
a better chance to get Sloane.

09:40.002 --> 09:43.593
Without Irina, Kashmir would
have been an embarrassment.

09:43.702 --> 09:46.202
Jack, when the hell
did we switch places?

09:46.236 --> 09:48.602
Derevko could be using
those operations

09:48.603 --> 09:50.468
to convince us
she's trustworthy.

09:50.469 --> 09:54.367
I've had 20 years to reflect on
that woman's ability to deceive.

09:54.469 --> 09:55.769
Trust me.

09:55.770 --> 09:59.532
If she lies to me again,
I'll know it.

09:59.636 --> 10:02.329
Stuka works out of a nightclub
in Bangkok.

10:02.437 --> 10:04.302
Why?

10:04.303 --> 10:06.302
Did Kendall approve the op?

10:06.303 --> 10:08.860
Yes.
We have a jet standing by.

10:12.404 --> 10:15.892
Oh, this is Marshall Flinkman.
He worked with us at SD-6.

10:16.004 --> 10:18.237
Hey.
How you doing?

10:18.238 --> 10:19.936
You're Sydney's mom.
That's cool.

10:19.937 --> 10:22.437
'Cause your daughter...
Awesome, by the way.

10:22.571 --> 10:25.968
Kendall insists you be injected
with a tracking device.

10:26.105 --> 10:29.094
I'll have a receiver that will
allow me to follow on-site.

10:29.205 --> 10:30.704
You won't know it's there

10:30.705 --> 10:33.966
unless we put it somewhere
where you might sit on it.

10:34.072 --> 10:37.232
Then you'll have, like,
a "Princess and the Pea" moment.

10:37.339 --> 10:39.138
Do you know that?

10:39.139 --> 10:41.471
Put it behind her shoulder.

10:41.472 --> 10:42.805
Um, okay.

10:42.806 --> 10:44.905
Uh, it might hurt a little bit.

10:44.906 --> 10:48.497
'Cause it's small,
but it's not really that small.

11:03.141 --> 11:05.834
Wow.
You're tough.

11:05.940 --> 11:09.895
Has Mr. Vaughn made
any large purchases recently?

11:13.341 --> 11:15.141
Not that I'm aware of.

11:15.142 --> 11:18.437
Has he changed his cellphone
in the past six months?

11:18.541 --> 11:20.974
I've answered that.
No.

11:20.975 --> 11:23.174
Why are you asking
the same question?

11:23.175 --> 11:26.663
We traced four cellphones
to Mr. Vaughn since October.

11:26.809 --> 11:29.331
I was hoping that
you would have noticed that.

11:29.475 --> 11:30.408
I didn't.

11:30.409 --> 11:33.603
Do you have private access
to his laptop computer?

11:33.709 --> 11:34.408
Excuse me?

11:34.409 --> 11:37.704
While he's sleeping or in
the shower or out of the house.

11:37.809 --> 11:39.908
We don't live together.

11:39.909 --> 11:42.042
Yeah.
I understand that.

11:42.043 --> 11:44.242
What are you asking me?

11:44.243 --> 11:48.073
There's a decryption program
called Xenon.

11:48.176 --> 11:50.043
And we have reason to believe

11:50.044 --> 11:52.805
that Mr. Vaughn has downloaded
this program

11:52.910 --> 11:54.842
to his personal laptop computer.

11:54.843 --> 11:57.043
And if he has,
he has broken the law.

11:57.044 --> 11:59.343
- That's insane.
- Well, maybe it is.

11:59.344 --> 12:03.333
Then we need confirmation
either way.

12:06.277 --> 12:10.266
You want me to check
Vaughn's computer.

12:10.378 --> 12:14.969
We simply want you to make
a little disk image.

12:15.078 --> 12:17.703
We want you to make a copy
of his hard drive

12:17.812 --> 12:20.403
and, uh, bring it back.

12:21.612 --> 12:22.644
Listen to me.

12:22.645 --> 12:25.202
There's not a chance
that he is a traitor,

12:25.312 --> 12:27.445
that he would be collaborating
with an enemy.

12:27.446 --> 12:30.969
You know, I knew your mother
about 20 years ago.

12:31.079 --> 12:32.412
Met her with your father.

12:32.413 --> 12:35.379
We used to go to a lot
of these agency functions.

12:35.513 --> 12:40.002
She was a charming,
very disarming woman...

12:42.846 --> 12:45.676
...who wasn't what she seemed.

12:45.780 --> 12:47.446
It is a mistake, Mr. Yeager,

12:47.447 --> 12:50.641
to confuse Michael Vaughn with
anything regarding my mother.

12:50.747 --> 12:53.247
She killed his father.

12:53.714 --> 12:56.047
I will not spy
on Michael Vaughn.

12:56.048 --> 12:59.502
Miss Bristow,
what is your priority?

12:59.614 --> 13:02.478
National security...

13:02.581 --> 13:05.081
or your new boyfriend?

13:13.481 --> 13:15.647
Weiss, have you seen Vaughn?

13:15.648 --> 13:18.239
That's all I am to you.
A conduit to Vaughn.

13:18.349 --> 13:20.782
Have you ever seen Vaughn
and said, "Where's Weiss?"

13:20.783 --> 13:22.581
I'm just looking for him.

13:22.582 --> 13:25.877
I just got called to briefing.
You know what this is about?

13:25.983 --> 13:27.982
No.

13:27.983 --> 13:29.215
- All right.
- See you.

13:29.216 --> 13:31.716
Yeah. See you.

14:56.455 --> 14:59.421
Let her go.
Play with me instead.

15:12.256 --> 15:14.255
Stop it.

15:14.256 --> 15:16.756
Why not?
You know me.

15:18.356 --> 15:20.856
I love games.

15:44.657 --> 15:46.756
Aah!

15:46.757 --> 15:49.023
- Drop the gun!
- Do it!

15:49.024 --> 15:52.218
- You bought a manuscript.
- I don't have it anymore.

15:52.358 --> 15:53.924
- Where is it?
- In Hong Kong.

15:53.925 --> 15:56.091
I traded it for opium rights.

15:56.092 --> 15:58.058
To who?

15:58.059 --> 15:59.590
To Chang.

15:59.591 --> 16:02.091
Aah!

16:16.160 --> 16:17.359
Once we get the manuscript,

16:17.360 --> 16:19.825
how do you intend to
let Sloane know?

16:19.826 --> 16:23.189
Word will get back to him
that I was in Bangkok.

16:28.260 --> 16:31.226
I did not see that fourth man.

16:32.994 --> 16:35.494
If you hadn't fired...

16:40.327 --> 16:43.781
I remember the first time
you introduced me to Sloane.

16:43.895 --> 16:46.793
You were both working
at the CIA.

16:46.895 --> 16:49.827
He came to the house for dinner.

16:49.928 --> 16:51.827
You were true friends.

16:51.828 --> 16:52.994
Yes.

16:52.995 --> 16:56.189
We shared a similar
unsentimental patriotism.

16:58.562 --> 17:01.994
And a devotion to our wives.

17:02.096 --> 17:07.994
But Sloane changed, and
it was Rambaldi that did it.

17:08.128 --> 17:11.821
I'm not sure what it is, but...

17:11.929 --> 17:15.223
Sloane has a personal connection
to Rambaldi.

17:15.329 --> 17:17.829
I lived for years
with the same obsession.

17:17.896 --> 17:21.090
To find a higher meaning
in Rambaldi's work.

17:23.997 --> 17:26.463
I never understood
how you managed to avoid

17:26.464 --> 17:28.329
getting caught up in it.

17:28.329 --> 17:31.057
I had something
neither of you did.

17:33.998 --> 17:36.498
Sydney.

17:44.365 --> 17:47.331
I never thanked you
for everything that...

17:51.865 --> 17:54.763
For raising our daughter.

17:56.299 --> 17:58.632
We land in four hours.

17:58.633 --> 18:01.133
Get some rest.

18:07.633 --> 18:10.758
Did you hear about
your mother? The operation?

18:10.900 --> 18:13.132
- Yeah, with my dad.
- How'd you find out?

18:13.133 --> 18:14.499
My dad told me.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.166
What was it? Courtesy?

18:16.167 --> 18:17.332
He just told me.

18:17.333 --> 18:20.493
Isn't that weird that they
wouldn't involve us at all?

18:20.600 --> 18:23.327
I mean, the decision
to reintroduce Irina Derevko,

18:23.434 --> 18:24.633
and we're not consulted.

18:24.634 --> 18:27.225
We can't be a part
of every operation.

18:27.334 --> 18:29.834
This one we should have been.

18:31.068 --> 18:33.568
I wouldn't read into it.

18:39.401 --> 18:41.958
You mind if I use your shower?

18:42.102 --> 18:44.602
You don't have to ask.

19:42.038 --> 19:44.595
Okay.
You can't tell anybody.

19:44.705 --> 19:47.296
- Swear to me.
- I swear.

19:51.273 --> 19:52.439
Okay. Sydney.

19:52.440 --> 19:54.940
This is gonna sound insane.

19:56.872 --> 19:59.238
But she works for the CIA.

19:59.239 --> 20:01.932
Come on. Seriously.

20:02.040 --> 20:03.605
Fran, think about it.

20:03.606 --> 20:06.572
What bank sends their employees
on that many trips?

20:06.673 --> 20:09.537
It's a cover job.
It's not even a good cover job.

20:09.640 --> 20:13.470
Those trips,
they're top-secret CIA missions.

20:13.574 --> 20:14.907
Come on, Will.

20:14.908 --> 20:18.271
I have seen her in action.
She is like Schwarzenegger.

20:18.374 --> 20:20.874
She's like the old
Schwarzenegger.

20:22.441 --> 20:26.373
So what does that mean?
I mean, are you CIA, too?

20:26.508 --> 20:28.407
No.

20:28.408 --> 20:30.908
No, I'm an analyst.

20:30.909 --> 20:33.409
Really?

20:48.376 --> 20:50.876
Hi.

20:51.609 --> 20:54.109
Morning.

20:54.910 --> 20:56.909
Where is everybody?

20:56.910 --> 20:58.609
Sydney just went to work.

20:58.610 --> 21:01.371
Francie left
about 20 minutes ago.

21:03.976 --> 21:05.943
You okay?

21:05.944 --> 21:08.444
No.
Actually, I'm not.

21:10.544 --> 21:13.305
I had this dream
that I told Francie

21:13.411 --> 21:16.138
everything I knew
about the agency.

21:16.244 --> 21:18.143
What do they have you
working on?

21:18.144 --> 21:21.405
I'm analyzing drug trafficking
through the Panama Canal.

21:21.511 --> 21:22.944
I'm reading cume data

21:22.945 --> 21:26.206
then downloading information
off the KH-11 satellite.

21:26.344 --> 21:28.969
- Exciting, right?
- Yeah, I guess. Why?

21:29.112 --> 21:30.977
'Cause it's common to dream,

21:30.978 --> 21:33.211
have anxiety
over keeping it secret.

21:33.212 --> 21:34.611
- Really?
- Goes away.

21:34.612 --> 21:37.373
- The excitement?
- No. The dreams.

21:44.846 --> 21:46.711
You must allow us entry.

21:46.712 --> 21:49.576
Our mandate to search has been
approved by Beijing.

21:49.680 --> 21:52.510
Noncompliance is a breach
of your agreements.

21:59.480 --> 22:00.979
I'm sorry for the delay.

22:00.980 --> 22:04.878
Only this morning did we learn
an inspection team was coming.

22:05.014 --> 22:07.809
We're investigating reports
that precursor chemicals

22:07.914 --> 22:10.180
have been stored
in official buildings.

22:10.181 --> 22:11.213
You are suggesting...

22:11.214 --> 22:13.280
That will be
for inspectors to decide.

22:13.281 --> 22:16.270
We are only here to conduct
the interviews.

23:03.884 --> 23:06.384
Let's go.

23:27.119 --> 23:28.251
Did you speak to Will?

23:28.252 --> 23:30.718
He was a little freaked out
this morning.

23:30.719 --> 23:32.385
What was that?

23:32.386 --> 23:34.886
Oh, just work stuff.

23:34.921 --> 23:37.386
Come here.

23:47.420 --> 23:49.920
Are you keeping secrets from me?

23:50.021 --> 23:51.886
What?

23:51.887 --> 23:54.387
Answer the question.

23:55.321 --> 23:57.553
I'm sure I am.
We just started dating.

23:57.554 --> 23:59.953
Of course there are things
I don't feel...

23:59.954 --> 24:02.454
- I'm not talking about us.
- What? Work?

24:02.488 --> 24:06.011
Yeah, there are things I'm not
authorized to talk about.

24:06.121 --> 24:08.621
And that's it?

24:08.955 --> 24:10.620
Look, there is something.

24:10.621 --> 24:13.678
I don't like it
when people question my loyalty.

24:15.588 --> 24:18.088
This isn't about loyalty.

24:18.089 --> 24:19.854
I never said anything
about loyalty.

24:19.855 --> 24:23.412
When you ask me if I'm keeping
secrets, the suggestion’s clear.

24:23.522 --> 24:25.288
And you know what?

24:25.289 --> 24:27.846
Secrets will be a problem
between us.

24:27.956 --> 24:31.047
After everything we've been
through, you should know that.

24:38.223 --> 24:40.389
This is the key to my apartment.

24:40.390 --> 24:42.947
I was gonna give it to you
tonight at dinner.

24:44.191 --> 24:47.021
Obviously an inappropriate move.

24:48.591 --> 24:50.523
Vaughn.

24:50.524 --> 24:53.149
Barnett's waiting for me.

25:07.158 --> 25:08.691
You made the right decision.

25:08.692 --> 25:10.257
That disk is blank.

25:10.258 --> 25:13.315
I didn't make a copy
of Agent Vaughn's hard drive.

25:13.425 --> 25:17.255
The fact that I doubted
Vaughn's motives makes me sick.

25:17.358 --> 25:20.949
You should be aware
that by choosing not to assist,

25:21.093 --> 25:24.388
you are implicating yourself
in Agent Vaughn's activities.

25:24.493 --> 25:25.525
Don't threaten me.

25:25.526 --> 25:27.659
You could be prosecuted
as an accessory.

25:27.660 --> 25:28.992
I understand.

25:28.993 --> 25:31.686
Understand that there are
consequences.

25:31.793 --> 25:34.759
There are consequences.
That's my point.

25:34.860 --> 25:37.026
Ask yourself.

25:37.027 --> 25:39.891
Would you betray
someone you love?

25:41.160 --> 25:44.853
Well, I guess we have an answer
to the intimacy question.

25:57.395 --> 25:58.960
Mr. Sloane.

25:58.961 --> 25:59.993
Yes.

25:59.994 --> 26:02.687
It seems Irina Derevko was seen
last night in Bangkok.

26:02.795 --> 26:03.794
Where?

26:03.795 --> 26:06.386
At a club with Ilya Stuka.

26:14.296 --> 26:17.625
- Sark made contact.
- He took the bait?

26:17.729 --> 26:20.627
He wants to discuss the purchase
of the manuscript.

26:20.729 --> 26:22.328
Can we trace his message?

26:22.329 --> 26:24.262
It was sent through remailers.

26:24.263 --> 26:27.854
I'm going to set up the meeting
in Panama.

26:27.996 --> 26:31.257
Jack, you make this happen,
you can have my job.

26:31.363 --> 26:33.429
No, thanks.
I'll need Delta Force.

26:33.430 --> 26:35.930
You'll get whatever you need.

26:56.531 --> 26:59.053
Dad says you're going to Panama.

27:01.199 --> 27:04.460
Do you think there's a chance
you'll get Sloane?

27:04.566 --> 27:07.066
I wanted to see you because...

27:09.499 --> 27:13.090
It's going to be dangerous
setting this trap.

27:13.200 --> 27:15.232
I hope it goes well.

27:15.233 --> 27:17.733
But there's no guarantee.

27:19.200 --> 27:22.030
So whatever happens,

27:22.133 --> 27:25.587
there's something
I need you to know.

27:29.633 --> 27:32.190
Sydney, I love you.

27:32.301 --> 27:33.866
Mom.

27:33.867 --> 27:35.833
You don't have to say anything.

27:35.834 --> 27:40.528
I'm pretty sure
I haven't earned very much.

27:40.634 --> 27:43.134
And that's okay.

27:46.135 --> 27:48.930
This was just something
I needed to say.

27:49.035 --> 27:51.899
Mom, you're coming back.

27:52.001 --> 27:54.501
I hope so.

28:11.736 --> 28:16.134
Did you have trouble
accessing the satellite images?

28:16.236 --> 28:18.036
Was anyone suspicious?

28:18.037 --> 28:19.836
No.

28:19.837 --> 28:22.036
I used them in my reports.

28:22.037 --> 28:24.696
Nobody was suspicious.

28:24.803 --> 28:28.963
The first image you saw.
See it in your mind.

28:29.070 --> 28:30.870
Do you see any markings?

28:30.871 --> 28:33.371
No, I don't think so.

28:35.571 --> 28:37.703
Wait.

28:37.704 --> 28:40.999
There are two sets of numbers
at the bottom right-hand corner.

28:41.138 --> 28:42.970
Read them to me.

28:42.971 --> 28:45.493
X8471.

28:45.638 --> 28:48.899
GY79863.

28:49.005 --> 28:50.337
What are they?

28:50.338 --> 28:52.963
The orbital location
of the satellite

28:53.072 --> 28:55.572
and its operational controls.

28:55.672 --> 28:58.172
Good.

28:58.539 --> 29:01.437
I'm gonna count back from 5.

29:01.539 --> 29:02.872
When you wake up,

29:02.873 --> 29:05.930
you'll have no memory
of this conversation.

29:06.040 --> 29:08.172
All you'll remember
is that tonight

29:08.173 --> 29:10.900
you had the best sex
of your life.

29:11.706 --> 29:13.872
5...

29:13.873 --> 29:16.373
4...

29:16.507 --> 29:18.806
3...

29:18.807 --> 29:21.140
2...

29:21.141 --> 29:23.641
1.

29:30.341 --> 29:32.373
Based on our agreement,

29:32.374 --> 29:35.771
you and two Delta Force guards
will be dropped off here.

29:35.875 --> 29:40.136
If Sloane follows the plan,
he'll drive north to meet you.

29:40.242 --> 29:42.742
Won't he be suspicious
if I don't have the manuscript?

29:42.775 --> 29:46.104
Sloane is smart enough to know
you would never bring it.

29:46.242 --> 29:48.308
He'll expect you have it
close by.

29:48.309 --> 29:51.241
CIA will be tracking you
back in Los Angeles

29:51.375 --> 29:54.535
in contact with me and a chopper
waiting 10 blocks away.

29:54.642 --> 29:56.175
When the call is made,

29:56.176 --> 30:00.437
the team will surround
the vehicle and ambush Sloane.

30:02.243 --> 30:03.842
Pretty straightforward.

30:03.843 --> 30:06.209
I think we've got a shot.

30:06.210 --> 30:08.375
There's one thing.

30:08.376 --> 30:10.933
The tracker you put
in my shoulder.

30:12.244 --> 30:13.642
You want it removed.

30:13.643 --> 30:17.735
If they discovered
I've been tagged, it's over.

30:17.844 --> 30:20.344
We both know that.

30:20.910 --> 30:25.171
Of course, Kendall would have me
court-martialed for this.

30:25.277 --> 30:28.107
Kendall's not as smart
as you are.

30:31.878 --> 30:34.378
Got it.

30:37.812 --> 30:40.312
You okay?

30:41.479 --> 30:43.979
This is nothing.

30:49.645 --> 30:52.145
We need to be up early.

30:52.912 --> 30:55.412
Yes.

30:56.513 --> 30:59.013
We should get to bed.

31:00.413 --> 31:02.913
Yeah, we should.

31:15.080 --> 31:18.534
Hey, you know the thing
we can't talk about?

31:18.647 --> 31:20.280
Well, I know a guy
who works with Yeager.

31:20.281 --> 31:23.906
He's about to file
a formal charge against Vaughn.

31:24.014 --> 31:25.280
- What?
- Yeah.

31:25.281 --> 31:26.614
I need to talk to him.

31:26.615 --> 31:29.775
No. Wait. You do that, you're
breaking six different laws.

31:29.915 --> 31:31.514
He needs to know.

31:31.515 --> 31:34.015
His phone is probably
already tapped.

31:35.149 --> 31:38.343
Agency cars are equipped
with GPS navigators.

31:38.449 --> 31:39.948
Can you access the system?

31:39.949 --> 31:42.449
Yeah.

31:56.417 --> 31:58.182
I found his car.

31:58.183 --> 31:59.815
Roger that.
Keep me posted.

31:59.816 --> 32:03.714
# You don't have to prove
your manhood to me constantly #

32:03.851 --> 32:05.016
# I know you're the man #

32:05.017 --> 32:09.177
# Can't you see
I love you righteously? #

32:09.284 --> 32:13.148
# Why you wanna dis me after
the way you been kissing me? #

32:13.251 --> 32:15.584
# After those pretty things
you say #

32:15.585 --> 32:18.608
# And the love we made today #

32:18.718 --> 32:22.741
# When you run your hand all up
and run it back down my leg #

32:22.852 --> 32:25.218
# Get excited
and bite my neck #

32:25.219 --> 32:28.344
# Get me all worked up
like that #

33:13.287 --> 33:15.787
What are you doing here?

33:17.754 --> 33:19.588
- Sydney...
- I asked a question.

33:19.589 --> 33:21.820
What's going on?
Are you following me?

33:21.821 --> 33:24.187
- You just bought something.
- It's research.

33:24.188 --> 33:25.488
Research?

33:25.489 --> 33:28.250
What kind of research?

33:28.355 --> 33:30.354
It's private.
Something just for me.

33:30.355 --> 33:33.515
Who do you think you work for?
Nothing is private.

33:35.022 --> 33:37.522
You're being investigated.

33:38.356 --> 33:38.855
What?

33:38.856 --> 33:41.879
When they find out
I've told you, I'll be a target.

33:42.823 --> 33:45.323
So don't lie to me.

33:47.324 --> 33:50.721
Sydney, I am not disloyal.

33:50.823 --> 33:55.721
Then why do they say you've been
meeting with FSB officers?

33:55.824 --> 33:59.051
An ex-KGB assassin?

33:59.157 --> 34:02.782
They have you in Istanbul,
Prague, Krakow.

34:02.891 --> 34:05.391
Without authorization.

34:09.458 --> 34:12.719
Vaughn, if there is
some explanation

34:12.824 --> 34:16.757
for what you've been doing
the past four months,

34:16.891 --> 34:20.255
I need to hear what it is.

34:20.358 --> 34:22.858
Right now.

35:04.895 --> 35:06.494
They're at the location.

35:06.495 --> 35:08.995
KH-11 has them on-screen.

35:10.262 --> 35:12.461
There's a limousine approaching.

35:12.462 --> 35:14.962
I see it.

35:24.796 --> 35:27.296
It's Sark.

35:34.830 --> 35:37.330
Delta Team, stand by.

35:46.663 --> 35:49.163
I realize the plan was
for Mr. Sloane to meet you.

35:49.231 --> 35:52.425
But for security reasons,
I'm afraid that's impossible.

35:52.531 --> 35:55.963
If you get in,
I'll take you to him.

35:56.065 --> 35:58.565
Only you.

35:58.798 --> 36:01.298
Why isn't she getting in?

36:01.998 --> 36:03.297
Where's Sloane?

36:03.298 --> 36:05.464
Close, I assure you.

36:05.465 --> 36:07.930
- Then bring him to me.
- That's not an option.

36:07.931 --> 36:09.865
Then our deal's off.

36:09.866 --> 36:12.366
So be it.

36:15.465 --> 36:17.965
Tell her to get in the car.
We'll track her.

36:17.966 --> 36:20.466
It's a big car.

36:21.366 --> 36:23.532
I believe there's room
for all of us.

36:23.533 --> 36:26.033
That wasn't the plan.

36:27.867 --> 36:30.367
Get in.

36:33.300 --> 36:36.857
He's letting her take guards.
How did she pull that off?

36:47.767 --> 36:51.494
Now I understand why you were
asking about secrets.

36:51.601 --> 36:55.658
Yes, there is something
I haven't told you.

36:55.768 --> 36:57.933
It hasn't been easy
accepting the idea

36:57.934 --> 37:00.764
that my job requires me to...

37:00.902 --> 37:03.201
collaborate
with my father's killer.

37:03.202 --> 37:05.235
The fact that
she happens to be your mother

37:05.236 --> 37:07.567
didn't make it easier.

37:07.568 --> 37:09.901
So I've been investigating her

37:09.902 --> 37:11.901
on my own
for the past six months.

37:11.902 --> 37:14.001
I couldn't wait
for the red tape,

37:14.002 --> 37:16.135
so I contacted everyone I could.

37:16.136 --> 37:19.533
Anyone who knew her,
who ran in the same circles.

37:21.070 --> 37:24.627
I retraced sat phone records
that were logged

37:24.736 --> 37:27.327
while your mother was with you
in India, Kashmir.

37:27.437 --> 37:30.301
Tracked conversations
between former lieutenants

37:30.403 --> 37:31.603
to see if she signaled

37:31.604 --> 37:34.331
when Kendall gave her access
to Echelon.

37:34.470 --> 37:36.636
You wanted us to work with her.

37:36.637 --> 37:39.364
I believed your father
about her secret agenda.

37:39.470 --> 37:41.903
I wanted to see
what she was going to do.

37:41.904 --> 37:44.870
I did all of this on my own.
I paid for this myself.

37:44.971 --> 37:48.835
I had freelance agents retrace
every step of every hour

37:48.938 --> 37:51.768
she's taken outside operations
since her surrender.

37:51.872 --> 37:54.667
I surveilled guards
assigned to her cellblock,

37:54.771 --> 37:56.704
the kitchen staff.

37:56.705 --> 37:58.538
They told me you downloaded
Xenon.

37:58.539 --> 38:02.198
I downloaded that program
to read KGB files.

38:02.305 --> 38:04.805
I had to find out
if she was deceiving us.

38:04.873 --> 38:09.271
I could not sleep at night
knowing I was doing nothing.

38:35.541 --> 38:38.302
We are visually tracking
a moving target.

38:38.407 --> 38:40.907
Stand by for go code.

38:43.075 --> 38:44.440
We've lost downlink.

38:44.441 --> 38:46.941
What?
Get back on-line.

38:47.608 --> 38:49.740
sir, someone's hacked
the signal.

38:49.741 --> 38:51.441
Are the codes good?

38:51.442 --> 38:54.408
Yes. Thank you.

38:56.076 --> 38:58.803
Jack, we're blind.
Follow her from your end.

38:58.909 --> 39:01.739
- Activate the tracking device.
- I can't.

39:03.409 --> 39:05.909
Send in the team.

39:05.976 --> 39:09.101
Delta Team, go.
Repeat, Delta Team, go.

39:14.177 --> 39:16.677
We've got them in sight.

39:31.711 --> 39:34.211
We're tracking.

39:34.777 --> 39:37.277
Stay with that car.

39:50.079 --> 39:51.577
Lost visual.

39:51.578 --> 39:53.245
Got them again.

39:53.246 --> 39:55.746
We're going to head them off.

40:12.280 --> 40:14.780
We got them stopped.
Stand by.

40:48.982 --> 40:50.915
Check the Rambaldi manuscript.

40:50.916 --> 40:53.416
Get me the Rambaldi
manuscript now.

41:05.016 --> 41:07.516
Step out of the car, please.

41:13.317 --> 41:15.817
And did you find anything?

41:17.184 --> 41:19.016
Nothing.

41:19.017 --> 41:21.517
She's clean.

41:24.684 --> 41:26.750
Do you have the book?

41:26.751 --> 41:29.251
It's coming.
It's coming.

42:02.020 --> 42:04.520
It's good to see you
again, Irina.

42:05.686 --> 42:08.186
Thank you for extracting me.

42:36.489 --> 42:38.989
Jack, it's gone.

42:39.305 --> 42:45.327
