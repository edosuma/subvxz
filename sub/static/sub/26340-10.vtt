WEBVTT

00:00.368 --> 00:01.902
Only on Fox.

00:04.839 --> 00:06.441
*

00:08.709 --> 00:11.979
(wailing)

00:12.012 --> 00:15.250
Life's not fair.

00:15.283 --> 00:16.517
It's not fair!

00:16.551 --> 00:18.319
Hank, are you crying?

00:18.353 --> 00:21.155
I'm not crying. You're crying!

00:21.188 --> 00:22.857
Margaret, what's wrong?

00:24.292 --> 00:26.093
My friend Donna died, okay?

00:26.126 --> 00:28.596
-MARGARET: Oh. Aw.
-Oh, that's too bad.

00:28.629 --> 00:31.198
Worst part is my ex-wife's going
to that funeral, too.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.368
I haven't seen that she-devil
since our divorce.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.536
I can't even stand
to hear her name.

00:35.570 --> 00:36.571
You mean Lorraine?

00:36.604 --> 00:38.606
Damn it, Sid!

00:38.639 --> 00:39.840
I assume she's gonna be there

00:39.874 --> 00:43.444
with her great big fiancÃ©,
Reggie.

00:43.478 --> 00:45.246
All right, that's it.
I'm not gonna go.

00:45.280 --> 00:47.782
That's a good idea.
Seeing Lorraine and her new man

00:47.815 --> 00:49.417
is the last thing you need.

00:49.450 --> 00:51.852
No, you absolutely have to go,
Hank.

00:51.886 --> 00:55.222
Good point.
You've got to go.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.425
The first time you see your ex
after you split

00:57.458 --> 00:59.126
is the Super Bowl
for winning the divorce.

00:59.159 --> 01:00.027
Take it from me.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.229
-Why? You won your divorce?
-(groans)

01:02.263 --> 01:04.198
No, I lost. Miserably.

01:04.231 --> 01:05.566
He was dropping our daughter off

01:05.600 --> 01:07.868
just as I was coming out
to get the paper,

01:07.902 --> 01:10.538
in my robe,
fresh out of the shower.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.607
Bent over to pick up the paper.

01:12.640 --> 01:15.276
The wind blew my robe up.
(sighs)

01:15.310 --> 01:18.446
He's been calling me
Newspaper Butt ever since.

01:18.479 --> 01:21.048
Damn, girl. That's rough.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.617
-Tears.
-Yeah.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.385
You think that's bad--
there was a busload

01:24.419 --> 01:25.920
of third graders
across the street.

01:25.953 --> 01:29.957
Now I'm a registered
sex offender.

01:29.990 --> 01:31.959
Anyway, you absolutely have
to do this, Hank.

01:31.992 --> 01:34.128
-You got to win this.
-How?

01:34.161 --> 01:36.631
Lorraine is engaged
to a former NFL player.

01:36.664 --> 01:38.399
I'm a former meter man.

01:38.433 --> 01:39.667
I will go with you.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.068
I will be your hype man.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.837
It's all about convincing
Lorraine

01:42.870 --> 01:44.405
that you are happier
without her.

01:44.439 --> 01:48.609
My job is to show her
how amazing your new life is.

01:48.643 --> 01:50.144
Well, how you gonna do that?

01:50.177 --> 01:51.178
I'm gonna lie.

01:51.211 --> 01:53.448
I'm gonna lie
my Newspaper Butt off.

01:53.481 --> 01:55.683
Ooh, can Charlie and me come?
We love funerals.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.318
-We never miss one.
-(Margaret laughs)

01:57.352 --> 01:59.987
You're acting like funerals
are parties.

02:00.020 --> 02:02.357
Uh, yeah!

02:02.390 --> 02:04.925
Yeah, think about it.
Teens have proms,

02:04.959 --> 02:08.329
young adults have weddings,
and we have funerals.

02:08.363 --> 02:10.798
It's the ultimate after-party.

02:10.831 --> 02:13.501
I get to wear my fanciest suit,
there's an open bar,

02:13.534 --> 02:17.204
and sometimes people hook up
right there in the funeral hall.

02:17.237 --> 02:20.274
Oh, come on.
Nobody gets freaky at funerals.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.810
Yes, they do! You've heard
of the mile-high club?

02:22.843 --> 02:24.679
There's also
a six-feet-under club.

02:24.712 --> 02:25.880
CHARLIE:
Yep.

02:25.913 --> 02:29.183
Get your computer and Bing it.

02:29.216 --> 02:31.619
All right. We're trying
to make Hank look cool here.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.688
You guys are not invited
to the funeral.

02:33.721 --> 02:34.889
Got it.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.891
See you at the reception.

02:39.694 --> 02:42.196
*

03:01.716 --> 03:03.484
All right.
Let's go over this again.

03:03.518 --> 03:05.252
You made some wise investments

03:05.285 --> 03:06.821
that allow you
to travel the world.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.723
You have multiple friends
with boats.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.525
And you hung out
with Don Johnson once

03:10.558 --> 03:11.926
at a Phoenix Suns game.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.528
Yeah, and he bought me
a hot dog,

03:13.561 --> 03:15.596
'cause he doesn't let fame go
to his head.

03:15.630 --> 03:17.565
That's why we're friends.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.099
'Sup, y'all?

03:19.133 --> 03:20.768
What's the haps
and where's the apps?

03:20.801 --> 03:24.038
-We're here to put the "fun"
in "funeral"!
-Yeah.

03:24.071 --> 03:26.040
What the hell
are you guys doing here?

03:26.073 --> 03:27.575
We told you--
we're funeral crashing.

03:27.608 --> 03:30.177
Just like they did in
that hit movie starring, um...

03:30.210 --> 03:32.046
Oh, what are their names again?

03:32.079 --> 03:33.881
The, um... the, um...

03:33.914 --> 03:35.883
the-the tall guy

03:35.916 --> 03:37.518
from the-the thing.

03:37.552 --> 03:40.387
(sighs)
Oh, who cares?

03:40.421 --> 03:41.722
Ooh, crab cakes!

03:41.756 --> 03:43.290
I don't know
where Donna ended up,

03:43.323 --> 03:47.728
but I have died
and gone to heaven.

03:47.762 --> 03:49.597
Margaret.
(panting)

03:49.630 --> 03:51.031
He... she...

03:51.065 --> 03:52.567
them.
(panting)

03:52.600 --> 03:53.968
That's them?

03:54.001 --> 03:55.570
That's Reggie?

03:55.603 --> 03:57.905
Damn.

03:58.773 --> 04:00.274
Damn.

04:00.307 --> 04:01.108
Margaret.

04:01.141 --> 04:03.277
Well, I'm sorry, but just...

04:03.310 --> 04:05.913
damn.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.382
All right, uh,
if this lie is gonna work,

04:08.415 --> 04:10.485
then you got to try to act cool,
okay?

04:10.518 --> 04:12.587
Pull it together.
You're drooling a little bit.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.054
Actually, so am I.

04:14.088 --> 04:15.389
This woman does something to me.

04:15.422 --> 04:18.593
She-she discombobulates
my-my-my-my...

04:18.626 --> 04:19.627
my-my-my-my...

04:19.660 --> 04:21.462
my-my head wires.

04:21.496 --> 04:23.731
Can you believe she threw
a perfectly good marriage,

04:23.764 --> 04:27.067
40 years, down the toilet
for this dumb jock?

04:27.101 --> 04:31.005
With all of that,
he doesn't need to be smart.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.808
All right, just c-calm down
and speak slowly.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.409
Everything's gonna be fine.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.111
Yeah, I mean, I got this.
I'm Hank.

04:37.144 --> 04:38.479
-Yeah.
-I'm Hank.

04:38.513 --> 04:39.514
I'm Hank!

04:39.547 --> 04:41.649
I know who the hell you are,
Hank.

04:41.682 --> 04:44.952
I was married to your old ass,
remember?

04:46.386 --> 04:49.490
Hi, Lorraine.
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm handsome.

04:49.524 --> 04:53.494
Don Johnson has hot dog
and-and-and boats.

04:53.528 --> 04:55.930
(chuckles)

04:55.963 --> 04:58.666
Killin' it.

05:08.208 --> 05:09.877
Well, hello, everyone.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.478
-I'm Margaret.
-Oh.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.781
-(chuckles)
-Well, you're Hank's girlfriend?

05:13.814 --> 05:16.784
Oh, well, let me just give you
a quick tip, baby girl.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.018
Run!

05:18.052 --> 05:19.854
Run for your life!

05:19.887 --> 05:21.622
Girlfriend?
No, no, no, no, no.

05:21.656 --> 05:24.224
I'm just his friend.
I'm one of his many friends.

05:24.258 --> 05:25.626
He is so popular.

05:25.660 --> 05:27.995
Nice to meet you, Margaret.
I'm Reggie.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.565
Yes, you are.

05:35.670 --> 05:36.971
Hey, man. I...

05:37.004 --> 05:38.639
Yeah, we met.

05:38.673 --> 05:41.676
You remember. When I walked in
on you sleeping with my wife

05:41.709 --> 05:43.010
in my bedroom.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.344
You a...

05:44.378 --> 05:47.848
whole lot taller standing up.

05:47.882 --> 05:49.183
So, you good?

05:49.216 --> 05:50.985
Y'all good? Everything good?

05:51.018 --> 05:52.186
Oh, lay off him.

05:52.219 --> 05:53.821
No, no, it's all right,
sweetheart.

05:53.854 --> 05:57.024
Hank, I want you to know,
man to man, that I'm sorry.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.893
I did what I did out of love.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.360
This woman is my soul mate.

06:00.394 --> 06:02.196
(chuckles)
That's right, baby.

06:02.229 --> 06:04.865
So, Hank, you're still bald.
That's going well?

06:04.899 --> 06:07.367
Well, actually,

06:07.401 --> 06:09.704
Hank is living pretty large
nowadays.

06:09.737 --> 06:13.007
He's made
some really good investments.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.911
Yeah, I got in early
on them, uh, dinosaur bones.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.212
Eggs, too.

06:18.245 --> 06:20.114
Course,
that's where the big money is,

06:20.147 --> 06:22.850
'cause you can, uh,
hatch more dinosaurs.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.619
(Margaret laughs)

06:24.652 --> 06:27.387
What a great joke.
(chuckles)

06:27.421 --> 06:30.190
Actually, he invested primarily
in cryptocurrencies,

06:30.224 --> 06:31.692
and he sold them
before they crashed.

06:31.726 --> 06:33.894
The dinosaur thing
is just a joke.

06:33.928 --> 06:35.596
-Right, Hank?
-Yeah.

06:35.630 --> 06:38.132
Because we all know
that the, uh, dinosaur bones,

06:38.165 --> 06:41.335
that's not an actual investment?

06:45.105 --> 06:47.241
So, uh, what about you, Reggie?

06:47.274 --> 06:48.709
What you doing
in your retirement?

06:48.743 --> 06:50.711
Did you have to sell
all your trophies like that,

06:50.745 --> 06:52.212
uh, O.J. there?

06:52.246 --> 06:53.648
No, no.

06:53.681 --> 06:56.116
I spend most of my time
helping the community.

06:56.150 --> 06:57.251
-Oh.
-Yeah.

06:57.284 --> 06:58.452
I play football with kids
that have cancer.

06:58.485 --> 07:01.288
Little Tyler got
his first touchdown this week.

07:01.321 --> 07:03.157
(exhales)

07:03.190 --> 07:04.725
(grunts)

07:04.759 --> 07:06.226
Sorry.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.763
They're just
such strong warriors, you know?

07:08.796 --> 07:10.197
They inspire me.

07:11.966 --> 07:13.801
Well, I do all that, too.

07:13.834 --> 07:16.804
Course, them little kids
never scored on me.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.605
(clears throat)
Did I hear somewhere

07:18.639 --> 07:21.508
that y'all two got engaged?

07:21.541 --> 07:23.277
I believe I heard the news.

07:23.310 --> 07:25.012
I was on a friend
of mine's yacht

07:25.045 --> 07:27.014
in "Ibitha" when I heard it.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.515
Well, anyway, congratulations

07:28.548 --> 07:30.317
for finally putting a ring
on it.

07:30.350 --> 07:31.652
(chuckles)
And what a ring.

07:31.686 --> 07:35.189
(chuckles) Okay,
shield your eyes, everybody.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.257
Pa-pow!
(chuckles)

07:37.291 --> 07:39.794
Ooh, I kept telling Reggie
it's too big.

07:39.827 --> 07:42.663
(chuckles): Especially compared
to my old one.

07:42.697 --> 07:44.198
Hank, where'd you get that from,
a vending machine?

07:44.231 --> 07:45.632
A cereal box?

07:45.666 --> 07:49.036
Honey, let's, uh, try
to keep this classy.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.905
I'm having lots of sex!

07:52.039 --> 07:53.207
With all kind of women.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.875
Hot women, too.

07:54.909 --> 07:56.844
Laying that pipe.

07:56.877 --> 07:59.446
MARGARET:
Yeah, it's true. (chuckles)

07:59.479 --> 08:02.349
He's broken a lot of hearts
and a lot of bed frames.

08:02.382 --> 08:05.652
It's not even gross
to think about.

08:05.686 --> 08:08.355
Well, um...
(stammers)

08:08.388 --> 08:10.357
R-Reggie just bought me a house.
Uh-huh.

08:10.390 --> 08:12.359
We do it in there.
(chuckles) Uh-huh.

08:12.392 --> 08:14.128
All up in the house.
(chuckles)

08:14.161 --> 08:15.462
I'm talking about sex. House.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.797
-Sex!
-Lorraine.

08:16.831 --> 08:18.699
-(chuckles)
-Lorraine, this is not the time

08:18.733 --> 08:20.567
nor the place to be so petty.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.970
All right?
L-Let's go pay our respects.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.671
Excuse us.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.977
-You see how rattled she was?
-(chuckles)

08:30.010 --> 08:32.579
Her left eye was twitching
all the way down.

08:32.612 --> 08:34.581
You are one hell of a hype man.

08:34.614 --> 08:35.883
-Thank you, Margaret!
-Mm-hmm.

08:35.916 --> 08:38.819
-Yep. You so won that.
-(laughing)

08:38.853 --> 08:42.022
By the way,
Reggie seems super nice.

08:42.056 --> 08:43.490
What a great guy.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.226
What a great big beautiful guy.

08:46.260 --> 08:47.527
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:47.561 --> 08:51.165
But what a great day
to be alive!

08:51.198 --> 08:52.532
I'm so sorry for your loss.

08:52.566 --> 08:55.035
Very special lady.

08:55.069 --> 08:58.272
(both laughing)

08:58.305 --> 09:00.074
(laughs):
Oh, Charlie.

09:00.107 --> 09:03.277
This might be the best funeral
we ever crashed.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.212
-Yeah.
-I know it would be tacky,

09:05.245 --> 09:06.713
but do you think we should take

09:06.747 --> 09:09.383
some of these lobster tails
to go?

09:09.416 --> 09:10.617
Are you kidding?

09:10.650 --> 09:12.186
I have so much shrimp
in my pockets,

09:12.219 --> 09:15.422
I smell like a chum bucket
at SeaWorld.

09:16.390 --> 09:17.858
Is that you, Bull's-eye?

09:17.892 --> 09:19.860
I knew it.
(chuckles)

09:19.894 --> 09:23.397
You old son of a bitch!
(chuckles)

09:23.430 --> 09:27.434
I can't believe you came!

09:28.268 --> 09:29.770
Well, of course I came!

09:29.804 --> 09:30.971
(chuckles nervously)

09:31.005 --> 09:32.907
(mouthing):
What's happening?

09:32.940 --> 09:34.408
(chuckles)

09:34.441 --> 09:35.910
I'll be damned.
I haven't seen you

09:35.943 --> 09:37.611
since we left our post in 'Nam.

09:37.644 --> 09:40.647
The best gunner
in the United States Air Force

09:40.680 --> 09:41.882
came all this way?

09:41.916 --> 09:44.384
(chuckles)
I'm honored.

09:44.418 --> 09:45.585
Pow, pow, pow.

09:45.619 --> 09:48.823
-And you must be Wilkins.
-What?

09:48.856 --> 09:51.658
The two of you always were
inseparable. (chuckles)

09:51.691 --> 09:53.794
We-we-we were?

09:53.828 --> 09:55.662
You know, there... I think
there's a tiny mix-up that...

09:55.695 --> 09:57.564
I can't tell you how...

09:57.597 --> 10:01.335
how much it means to me you've
come to my wife's funeral.

10:01.368 --> 10:04.604
But I guess that's what you do
for your colonel.

10:04.638 --> 10:08.575
It's just so good
to see your faces.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.444
(stammering)

10:10.477 --> 10:13.613
Wilkins and I wouldn't
have missed it for the world!

10:13.647 --> 10:15.916
And I'm Bull's-eye!

10:15.950 --> 10:18.118
The other guys in our squadron

10:18.152 --> 10:21.856
are gonna crap twice and die
when they see you.

10:21.889 --> 10:24.324
-Come on.
-I'm crapping already.

10:25.659 --> 10:27.194
Thanks for your help.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.864
But you should've let me go on
about the dinosaur bones.

10:29.897 --> 10:32.432
Lorraine loves
those Jurassic Park movies.

10:32.466 --> 10:35.302
Sometimes she likes me
to dress up as a dinosaur,

10:35.335 --> 10:37.371
you know, for the lovemaking.
(chuckles)

10:37.404 --> 10:38.873
Tyrannosaurus Sex!

10:38.906 --> 10:40.540
That's what she called it.

10:40.574 --> 10:42.009
I guess...

10:42.042 --> 10:43.543
that's a story for another time.

10:43.577 --> 10:47.181
Yeah. I think that might be
a story for a never time.

10:47.214 --> 10:48.682
Oh! They're arguing.

10:48.715 --> 10:50.384
She just tilted her head.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.052
That means she is pissed.

10:52.086 --> 10:54.288
And if she flips her hair,
look out.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.224
Come on, girl, flip your hair.
Flip your hair, baby.

10:57.257 --> 10:59.459
-She flipped her hair.
-What does that mean?

10:59.493 --> 11:02.796
That means they're in a big ol'
fight and I won my divorce.

11:02.829 --> 11:06.333
And Reggie's leaving.
(laughs)

11:06.366 --> 11:08.568
Well, we may just have ruined
her whole life.

11:08.602 --> 11:09.870
Awesome.

11:09.904 --> 11:11.305
Yeah, now she's alone.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.140
All alone.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.642
Sexy and alone.

11:15.675 --> 11:16.877
Wait, what?

11:16.911 --> 11:17.912
I'm gonna go get my wife back.

11:17.945 --> 11:19.313
You said you hate her.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.680
Yeah. That's when
she wasn't available.

11:20.714 --> 11:21.882
Wish me luck.

11:21.916 --> 11:23.750
Tyrannosaurus Sex
is heading in.

11:23.783 --> 11:26.053
(roaring)

11:32.626 --> 11:34.428
*

11:34.461 --> 11:37.564
Hey, boys, look who I found.

11:37.597 --> 11:40.200
Bull's-eye and Wilkins.

11:40.234 --> 11:42.702
You guys have a lot
to catch up on.

11:42.736 --> 11:45.405
Yeah, we certainly do.

11:45.439 --> 11:47.707
-Uh...
-Yeah.

11:47.741 --> 11:49.576
Yep.

11:49.609 --> 11:51.411
You guys start.

11:51.445 --> 11:53.413
May I have your attention?

11:53.447 --> 11:58.785
Uh, look, I just want to thank
you all for coming here today.

11:58.818 --> 12:02.856
To honor Donna's memory,
my squadron and I

12:02.889 --> 12:06.860
are gonna sing our old
Air Force fight song.

12:06.893 --> 12:10.230
-You ready, boys?
-Um...

12:10.264 --> 12:12.766
(humming)

12:12.799 --> 12:14.568
-* Off we go
-* We go

12:14.601 --> 12:16.903
-* Into the wild blue yonder
-* Going up there

12:16.937 --> 12:18.605
* Climbing high

12:18.638 --> 12:20.707
-* Into the sun
-* Into the sky

12:20.740 --> 12:22.776
-* Here they come
-* Off we have

12:22.809 --> 12:25.412
-* Zooming to meet our thunder
-* We are four men

12:25.445 --> 12:27.982
* At 'em, boys,
give 'er the gun *

12:28.015 --> 12:29.716
-* And keeping it dry
-* Pa-pa-pa-pow

12:29.749 --> 12:32.486
* Down we dive,
spouting our flames from under *

12:32.519 --> 12:34.554
CHARLIE:
* Spilling the vapors near you

12:34.588 --> 12:37.657
Oh, hey, Lorraine.

12:37.691 --> 12:39.493
You're sitting all alone.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.728
Baby, you all right?

12:41.761 --> 12:43.930
Shut up, Hank. I'm fine.

12:43.964 --> 12:46.133
Well, I saw you flip your hair,
girl.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.601
(whoops)

12:47.634 --> 12:50.304
I see that you and Reggie
were fighting.

12:50.337 --> 12:52.506
Yeah, whatever.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.741
We're going through
a rough patch.

12:54.774 --> 12:59.546
Thinking about you in Ibiza
with all your yacht hos...

13:01.215 --> 13:02.816
-Made me feel a little...
-Jealous?

13:02.849 --> 13:04.351
-Yes.
-Envious?

13:04.384 --> 13:07.687
Well, it means the same thing,
so yeah.

13:07.721 --> 13:09.656
Congratulations.

13:09.689 --> 13:11.858
Your life is better than mine.

13:11.891 --> 13:13.627
Well, uh... (clears throat)

13:13.660 --> 13:16.163
Here's the deal-- it's not.

13:16.196 --> 13:17.797
Look, uh, me and Margaret

13:17.831 --> 13:19.799
kind of stretched
the truth there a little bit.

13:19.833 --> 13:23.537
(clears throat) I've never been
to "Ibitha," and I'm not rich.

13:23.570 --> 13:26.506
I just told you all that
to make you jealous and envious.

13:26.540 --> 13:29.209
Oh, that's messed up.

13:29.243 --> 13:31.211
(chuckles)
But to tell you the truth,

13:31.245 --> 13:34.014
it's kind of refreshing.

13:34.048 --> 13:36.350
I mean, Reggie,
he's just too nice.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.718
Even when we argue,
he's never mad.

13:38.752 --> 13:39.886
Well, that's too bad.

13:39.919 --> 13:41.621
It sounds like
there's no fire.

13:41.655 --> 13:42.789
Now, me and you?

13:42.822 --> 13:45.559
-We had fire.
-Ugh.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.627
We were a fire hazard.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.029
Mmm.

13:49.063 --> 13:52.299
The best part about fighting
was the making up afterwards.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.734
(chuckles)
Shut up, Hank.

13:54.768 --> 13:56.336
(both laugh)

14:00.840 --> 14:02.409
* Flying men

14:02.442 --> 14:04.811
* Guarding our nation's border

14:04.844 --> 14:08.882
* We'll be there,
followed by more *

14:08.915 --> 14:11.318
* In echelon

14:11.351 --> 14:13.353
* We carry on

14:13.387 --> 14:17.857
* Shout! Nothing can stop
the U.S. Air Force *

14:17.891 --> 14:22.062
* Air Force.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.932
(applause)

14:25.965 --> 14:28.068
-Oh, wow.
-Ah. Oh.

14:28.102 --> 14:30.937
-That was fun.
-Yeah.

14:30.970 --> 14:32.739
What the hell, you guys?

14:32.772 --> 14:35.041
Why are you singing
with the Air Force?

14:35.075 --> 14:37.043
Well, isn't it obvious,
Margaret?

14:37.077 --> 14:40.380
We have to pretend that we're
Bull's-eye and Wilkins

14:40.414 --> 14:43.083
so the colonel
doesn't get upset.

14:43.117 --> 14:45.185
(laughs) Yeah.
Catch up, Margaret.

14:45.219 --> 14:47.554
And where's Hank?
He missed our big number.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.689
Oh, he ran off with Lorraine
a while ago.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.858
I think he's trying
to have dinosaur sex

14:51.891 --> 14:53.893
-with her or something.
-Oh, no.

14:53.927 --> 14:56.363
He didn't do the arms, did he?

14:56.396 --> 14:58.365
How did you let this happen?

14:58.398 --> 15:00.200
He was almost over her.

15:00.234 --> 15:02.402
Lorraine is poison for him.

15:02.436 --> 15:04.538
Yeah, Margaret.
We ought to put you in the brig.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.407
That's Air Force for jail.

15:07.441 --> 15:09.243
How is this my fault?

15:09.276 --> 15:11.145
Hank is a mature man.

15:11.178 --> 15:13.113
He can think for hims-s...

15:13.147 --> 15:15.149
Oh, this is all my fault.

15:15.182 --> 15:16.783
We got to go stop them.

15:16.816 --> 15:19.719
-Let's bring our boy back home.
-Yeah.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.555
* Off we go

15:21.588 --> 15:23.590
-* Into the wild blue yonder
-* Pa-pow!

15:23.623 --> 15:25.325
* Pa-pa-pa-pow...

15:27.194 --> 15:29.596
Maybe they're in here?

15:29.629 --> 15:31.965
Oh, no.

15:31.998 --> 15:34.000
Definitely not in here.

15:34.033 --> 15:37.604
(chuckles) A dark room
filled with velvet-lined beds?

15:37.637 --> 15:39.339
Oh, yeah, they're in here.

15:39.373 --> 15:43.009
Nobody has sex in a coffin.

15:43.042 --> 15:45.011
Um, coffin salesmen?

15:45.044 --> 15:47.314
Count Dracula?

15:47.347 --> 15:50.650
That's two just off
the top of my head.

15:50.684 --> 15:53.019
(thudding)

15:53.052 --> 15:55.522
Ooh. Oh, boy.

15:55.555 --> 15:58.124
We're about to see Hank naked.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.993
All right, well, if you have
have a weak stomach,

16:00.026 --> 16:01.195
you might want to turn away.

16:01.228 --> 16:02.862
I will be turning away.

16:02.896 --> 16:04.164
Go for it, Charlie.

16:04.198 --> 16:06.566
I'm on it.

16:07.701 --> 16:09.303
(clears throat)

16:09.336 --> 16:11.505
-Hi, Hank.
-Ooh.

16:13.072 --> 16:14.874
What the hell?

16:14.908 --> 16:19.246
You guys have weddings
and proms. This is our thing.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.682
I'm okay with letting them have
this one.

16:25.652 --> 16:26.953
Hey, when you guys are done,

16:26.986 --> 16:29.356
there's sandwiches
in the other room.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.360
Ooh, ooh.

16:33.393 --> 16:35.962
We're about to do this, huh?
At the funeral?

16:35.995 --> 16:37.364
You damn straight.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.633
(roaring)

16:39.666 --> 16:42.068
Ooh, I can't believe
I'm actually going

16:42.101 --> 16:43.970
to join the six-feet-under club.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.706
-That's a real thing?
-Oh, yeah.

16:46.740 --> 16:49.008
I'm just taking this
as your official apology

16:49.042 --> 16:51.144
for cheating on me
and throwing 40 years

16:51.177 --> 16:52.746
of marriage down the drain.

16:52.779 --> 16:55.081
It's okay, I forgive you, baby.

16:55.114 --> 16:57.917
Ow! What the hell?

16:57.951 --> 16:59.519
Me apologize to you?

16:59.553 --> 17:01.187
The divorce was your fault.

17:01.221 --> 17:03.223
My fault? You cheated on me.

17:03.257 --> 17:04.691
Because you were
a terrible husband.

17:04.724 --> 17:06.226
You always forgot
our anniversary.

17:06.260 --> 17:08.328
That's 'cause it was so close
to Christmas.

17:08.362 --> 17:10.129
It was in April, Hank.

17:11.565 --> 17:13.199
You never did a damn thing.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.034
Never, ever, ever, ever, ever!

17:15.068 --> 17:17.170
-You never did the laundry.
-You were better at it.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.038
-You never cooked.
-You were better at it.

17:19.072 --> 17:22.709
-You never listened to me.
-You were better at it!

17:22.742 --> 17:24.744
Now, are we sexy fighting,
or are we real fighting?

17:24.778 --> 17:27.180
Okay, so we're real fighting
now.

17:27.213 --> 17:31.184
I can't believe I almost made
this-this huge mistake.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.387
You know what, Hank?

17:33.420 --> 17:36.089
You're not a Tyrannosaurus Sex.

17:36.122 --> 17:37.691
You're a selfish pig.

17:37.724 --> 17:41.027
Oink. Oink. Piggy. (laughs)

17:41.060 --> 17:42.996
Piggy!

17:50.270 --> 17:52.138
(sighs) There you are.

17:52.171 --> 17:54.774
Please tell us you didn't sleep
with Lorraine.

17:54.808 --> 17:57.411
And if you did,
please tell us how it was.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.879
No, I did not.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.148
You're not gonna believe
what this crazy lady said.

18:02.181 --> 18:03.483
Now, y'all ready to laugh?

18:03.517 --> 18:05.985
Yeah, we're at a funeral,
aren't we?

18:06.019 --> 18:07.454
Well, get this.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.423
She said the divorce
was all my fault

18:09.456 --> 18:11.124
because I was a lousy husband,

18:11.157 --> 18:13.293
I was selfish
and never listened to her.

18:13.327 --> 18:15.495
Well, is all of that true?

18:15.529 --> 18:17.230
Well, I don't know.
She cheated on me.

18:17.263 --> 18:20.967
Did you ever stop to think why
she cheated on you?

18:23.002 --> 18:26.873
I-I bet it's 'cause of all
that stuff he just said.

18:29.275 --> 18:32.278
What? Am I sucking too loud?

18:37.150 --> 18:38.418
Hey.

18:38.452 --> 18:39.919
Leave me alone.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.988
-Listen, I want to...
-Oh, now you want me to listen?

18:42.021 --> 18:44.358
I listened for 40 years;
I'm done listening.

18:44.391 --> 18:47.627
I only ever looked at our
divorce from my point of view.

18:47.661 --> 18:49.429
I'm listening.

18:49.463 --> 18:52.599
Well, it was easy for me
to blame you for the divorce

18:52.632 --> 18:54.200
'cause you cheated on me,

18:54.233 --> 18:57.671
but I realize now our marriage
was broken long before that.

18:57.704 --> 18:59.305
Well, thank you.

18:59.339 --> 19:00.874
Thank you for saying that.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.609
Th-That means a lot.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.210
Well, I'll take my 50%
of the blame.

19:04.243 --> 19:05.612
I took you for granted.

19:05.645 --> 19:09.215
Yes, you did, but I still
shouldn't have cheated on you.

19:09.248 --> 19:11.385
Well, that's your 50%.

19:11.418 --> 19:14.488
And Reggie's a good guy.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.523
I see how he's taking care
of you,

19:16.556 --> 19:20.293
and, well, maybe that's more
important than having fire.

19:20.326 --> 19:21.961
Lorraine, I've been looking
all over for you.

19:21.995 --> 19:23.463
-Oh.
-I'm sorry.

19:23.497 --> 19:24.898
-Mm.
-Yeah.

19:24.931 --> 19:28.468
I should actually get those back
to the altar.

19:28.502 --> 19:30.169
I felt weird taking them,

19:30.203 --> 19:33.072
but I didn't want to show up
without a gift for you.

19:34.107 --> 19:35.842
I should have never
left you alone

19:35.875 --> 19:37.343
at your friend's funeral, baby.

19:37.377 --> 19:40.380
That was wrong of me,
and I take full responsibility.

19:40.414 --> 19:41.748
You forgive me?

19:41.781 --> 19:43.517
(chuckles) See?

19:43.550 --> 19:45.985
That's how you do it.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.021
I forgive you, baby.

19:48.054 --> 19:49.055
(coughing):
Wuss.

19:49.088 --> 19:51.224
-Did you just call me a wuss?
-No, no.

19:51.257 --> 19:53.192
I was calling myself
a wuss. Look at you.

19:53.226 --> 19:55.395
You're tall
and-and-and strong. Bye.

20:00.767 --> 20:03.437
So I called him a "wuss"
right to his face.

20:03.470 --> 20:06.172
I was gonna knock him out,
but then he got on his knees

20:06.205 --> 20:08.842
and begged forgiveness,
so I let it slide.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.376
I wish you guys
could have seen it,

20:10.410 --> 20:13.246
-'cause it definitely happened.
-Yeah.

20:15.549 --> 20:16.983
Sid.

20:19.486 --> 20:21.087
At ease, gentlemen.

20:21.120 --> 20:24.223
I know you're not
Bull's-eye and Wilkins.

20:24.257 --> 20:26.760
You do? How?

20:27.927 --> 20:30.764
'Cause they're not real people.
I made them up.

20:31.998 --> 20:34.100
I knew you were crashers
the minute I saw you,

20:34.133 --> 20:36.269
like, uh, Vince Vaughn
and Owen Wilson.

20:36.302 --> 20:39.372
That's it.

20:39.405 --> 20:43.276
So the boys and I had some fun
with you. (laughs)

20:43.309 --> 20:46.646
Seeing you try to sing our song
was hilarious.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.948
Hilarious
'cause we were so good?

20:48.982 --> 20:50.383
* So good

20:50.416 --> 20:53.787
(high-pitched):
* Good.

20:53.820 --> 20:56.255
Uh, no.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.493
But listen,

20:59.526 --> 21:02.496
it was nice having a laugh
on such a tough day.

21:02.529 --> 21:05.431
So, uh, thanks, boys.

21:05.465 --> 21:09.068
Madam, are you ready
for our date?

21:09.102 --> 21:12.138
Sir, yes, sir.

21:12.171 --> 21:14.173
I'll, uh, see you out there.

21:14.207 --> 21:17.644
What? I like a man in uniform.

21:17.677 --> 21:18.912
Oh, come on.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.848
His wife is dead.
Leave me alone.

21:21.881 --> 21:24.017
* Off I go

21:24.050 --> 21:27.186
* Into the wild blue yonder

21:27.220 --> 21:30.524
* Flying high into the sun,
pa-pa-pa-pow. *

21:34.160 --> 21:35.161
That's pretty good.

21:40.567 --> 21:42.602
You've made the cut
with The Cool Kids.
