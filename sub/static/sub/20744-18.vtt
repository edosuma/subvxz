I have to say.
Listen, your character just ootz

07:23.398 --> 07:27.001
oozed through that song.
I do say I like it when you give

07:27.002 --> 07:29.136
me more big notes.
I felt look you were holding

07:29.137 --> 07:30.000
back a little bit.
I did.

07:30.001 --> 07:31.739
Back a little bit.

You are here to win.
And I like shows with people who

08:22.958 --> 08:27.561
want to win.
That line "I picked myself, get

08:27.562 --> 08:29.999
up, back in the race."
That's why the song was so

08:30.000 --> 08:30.432

That's why the song was so

08:30.433 --> 08:32.166

09:36.231 --> 09:41.835
The queen of diamonds.

I am just so happy to see you

You really light up the room.

10:06.487 --> 10:09.089
Oh, yeah, welcome back

10:09.090 --> 10:12.826
This is the first semifinal.
11 acts fighting for five spots

10:12.827 --> 10:15.495
in the finals.
Let them know that you are

10:15.496 --> 10:19.065
rooting for them.
Find them at nbc and get

10:19.066 --> 10:21.468
involved.
You can also follow the judges

10:21.469 --> 10:23.169
too.
They tweet about their reaction

10:23.170 --> 10:26.406

Join in on the conversation, get

10:26.407 --> 10:29.164
your voice out there.
Okay.

10:29.165 --> 10:29.176
Your voice out there.
Okay.

10:29.177 --> 10:32.045
Next up.
A magician who has dazzled the

10:32.046 --> 10:35.882
judges and you at home every
time he has taken the stage.

10:35.883 --> 10:38.852
Can he do it and make it to the
finals?

10:38.853 --> 10:44.457
Find out.
He is Blake vogt.

10:44.458 --> 10:49.529
Hey, what are you working on?
>> An idea.

10:49.530 --> 10:51.932
"America's got talent" is
keeping me really busy, but at

10:51.933 --> 10:54.968
the exact same time, we're
planning a wedding.

10:54.969 --> 10:59.164
Oh, my gosh, it is so soon.
Coming up so soon.

10:59.165 --> 10:59.573
Oh, my gosh, it is so soon.
Coming up so soon.

10:59.574 --> 11:02.642
We have been dating now
almost seven years.

11:02.643 --> 11:06.980
It was this college mixer.
And Nikki was my best friend's

11:06.981 --> 11:13.887
date. Meed immediately had a crush and
spent the whole night talking to

11:13.888 --> 11:16.623
his date.
Sorry, Dave.

11:16.624 --> 11:20.093
I proposed to Nikki over a year
ago.

11:20.094 --> 11:23.663
I got down on one knee, I asked.
I think I blacked out.

11:23.664 --> 11:25.298
He did.
I said of course.

11:25.299 --> 11:28.935
I never thought that I would be
marrying a magician.

11:28.936 --> 11:29.165
Tah‐dah.
>> The queen of diamond!

11:29.166 --> 11:35.108
Tah‐dah.
>> The queen of diamond!

11:35.109 --> 11:38.778
When he is on stage and
everybody is watching, I'm like,

11:38.779 --> 11:43.450
hey, that's mine.
I got him.

11:43.451 --> 11:47.620
I have seen how hard he works
every single day.

11:47.621 --> 11:50.557
And this opportunity is like no
other.

11:50.558 --> 11:56.830
You deserve to be in the finals.
>> My dream would definitely be

11:56.831 --> 11:59.164
to do this full time and make a
good living doing it, and not

11:59.165 --> 12:00.134
to do this full time and make a
good living doing it, and not

12:00.135 --> 12:02.469
the living that you and your
parent probably thought a

12:02.470 --> 12:10.470
- magician would have.
- Cheer

12:13.481 --> 12:17.550
cheer.
>> My fiancee is up in the

12:17.551 --> 12:21.821
balcony, wave, Nikki.
Actually, Nikki and I have a

12:21.822 --> 12:24.791
nerdy debate going between the
two of us, about superpowers.

12:24.792 --> 12:29.164
The big debate is the superpower
of flight and superpore of

12:29.165 --> 12:31.398
the big debate is the superpower
of flight and superpore of

12:31.399 --> 12:32.799
invisibility.
Which would you choose if you

12:32.800 --> 12:35.335
had the choice.
I thought I would demonstrate

12:35.336 --> 12:39.205
both tonight.
Simon, touch the back of any

12:39.206 --> 12:40.340
card.
Which one?

12:40.341 --> 12:41.741
This one right here.
Okay.

12:41.742 --> 12:43.643
Have you look at the card,
Simon.

12:43.644 --> 12:46.112
And memorize it.
>> I got it.

12:46.113 --> 12:52.252
It is the 10 of clubs.
>> That's not magic.

12:52.253 --> 12:55.121
I can see it in the monitor
behind you.

12:55.122 --> 12:56.523
That was dumb.
Okay.

12:56.524 --> 12:58.158
Watch.
What I well do is.

12:58.159 --> 12:59.164
Tear off the corner of the ten.
Have you hold it on to me.

12:59.165 --> 13:01.494
Tear off the corner of the ten.
Have you hold it on to me.

13:01.495 --> 13:04.764
First I will demonstrate the
power of invisibility.

13:04.765 --> 13:08.501
Watch as a piece becomes
invisible.

13:08.502 --> 13:10.437
Pretty cool.
Pretty cool.

13:10.438 --> 13:14.707
Yeah, yeah, now, Nikki's
favorite superpower is flight.

13:14.708 --> 13:19.212
If I cause that piece to fly
through the air, land in the

13:19.213 --> 13:21.147
box.
Heidi if you wouldn't mind.

13:21.148 --> 13:23.583
Grab the box.
Dump out what is inside.

13:23.584 --> 13:25.552
There is a little piece, maybe.
Yes.

13:25.553 --> 13:27.620
Make sure it matches.
Simon.

13:27.621 --> 13:29.164
Make sure the piece matches the
card.

13:29.165 --> 13:30.457
Make sure the piece matches the
card.

13:30.458 --> 13:33.726
Pretty cool?
Pretty cool?

13:33.727 --> 13:38.164
Now, that, that is invisibility
and flight with playing cards.

13:38.165 --> 13:40.233
What if I could do that with
myself?

13:40.234 --> 13:48.234
So tonight ‐‐ it's ‐‐ it is agt,
nbc, live semifinals here at

13:48.609 --> 13:51.277
dolby theater.
I brought the scissor lift.

13:51.278 --> 13:54.647
I thought we would up the magic.
What I am going to do for all of

13:54.648 --> 13:59.164
you.
Is take my magic to the next

13:59.165 --> 13:59.620
you.
Is take my magic to the next

13:59.620 --> 14:00.254
level.♪♪♪♪

14:00.255 --> 14:08.255
♪♪♪♪thank you.

14:10.631 --> 14:14.834
So first invisibility.
Now the only awkward thing about

14:14.835 --> 14:19.906
invisibility is I can only make
my body invisible.

14:19.907 --> 14:23.743
Not my clothes.
So let me take off this shirt.

14:23.744 --> 14:28.114
Won't be needing that.
And, ha‐ha‐ha.

14:28.115 --> 14:29.164
Let me get rid of these pants.
I won't be needing those.

14:29.165 --> 14:31.217
Let me get rid of these pants.
I won't be needing those.

14:31.218 --> 14:35.522
Hope this works.
I present to you, invisibility.

14:35.523 --> 14:43.523
In three, two, one.
Invisible.

14:46.233 --> 14:52.839
Nailed it.
So, now that I have, nailed

14:52.840 --> 14:54.407
invisibility.
I will present to you the power

14:54.408 --> 14:56.943
of flight.
The power of flight.

14:56.944 --> 14:59.164
In, three, two, one.
I'm up here in the back!

14:59.165 --> 15:07.165
In, three, two, one.
I'm up here in the back!

15:21.468 --> 15:24.037
Invisibility.
The power of flight.

15:24.038 --> 15:29.164
Blake vogt is incredible.
Heidi.

15:29.165 --> 15:31.344
Blake vogt is incredible.
Heidi.

15:31.345 --> 15:34.147
Everybody in here is standing up
for Mr. vogt.

15:34.148 --> 15:41.287
- Heidi, what do you think?
- I know for the act you

15:41.288 --> 15:44.290
want to be bigger.
I don't think bigger is always

15:44.291 --> 15:45.992
better.
Though, Simon thinks bigger is

15:45.993 --> 15:51.864
- always better.
- What is everybody

15:51.865 --> 15:58.438
booing about?
>> Howie:

15:58.439 --> 15:59.165
I love the close‐up magic.

15:59.165 --> 15:59.673
I love the close‐up magic.

15:59.674 --> 16:02.408
Started with the card trick.
Took the piece off.

16:02.409 --> 16:07.480
It was in the ‐‐
what are you talking

16:07.481 --> 16:10.049
about?
>> I feel like he hit the brick

16:10.050 --> 16:12.852
wall with the brick suit.
For me it got a little silly.

16:12.853 --> 16:17.123
Because normally.
I always wonder how did he do

16:17.124 --> 16:18.591
that?
Today I am not wondering how did

16:18.592 --> 16:21.461
- he do that?
- What are you talking

16:21.462 --> 16:25.031
- about?
- Can you make sense?

16:25.032 --> 16:25.866
Awe awe.

16:25.867 --> 16:28.534
I can't make any sense
of what Klum said.

16:28.535 --> 16:29.165
Here is what I think.
You managed to fly from there in

16:29.166 --> 16:32.839
here is what I think.
You managed to fly from there in

16:32.840 --> 16:38.511
front of us, and this one is
talking about a card trick.

16:38.512 --> 16:44.083
I mean, seriously?
So I think ‐‐ I don't know how

16:44.084 --> 16:47.320
that happened.
I think this performance may

16:47.321 --> 16:54.294
- have just changed your life.
- Wow.

16:54.295 --> 16:58.231
Mr. Howie mandel.
Two totally different extremes

16:58.232 --> 16:59.165
of opinion on the other side of
the judging table.

16:59.166 --> 17:00.600
Of opinion on the other side of
the judging table.

17:00.601 --> 17:06.673
- What do you think?
- Closer to what Simon

17:06.674 --> 17:08.274
is saying.
The best act you have done on

17:08.275 --> 17:10.810
the show.
You are so lookable.

17:10.811 --> 17:12.145
Lovable.
This is the first time.

17:12.146 --> 17:15.281
I think you needed it to grow
and be bigger instead of the

17:15.282 --> 17:16.716
close‐up magic.
I loved it.

17:16.717 --> 17:19.252
I thought I was disappointed
when I saw the cards.

17:19.253 --> 17:22.622
When I see you up there, it was
spectacular.

17:22.623 --> 17:25.858
- >> Thank you, thank you.
- Mel b.

17:25.859 --> 17:28.394
I liked it.
I was looking up there going,

17:28.395 --> 17:29.165
please take off that mask so I
know it is you.

17:29.166 --> 17:30.530
Please take off that mask so I
know it is you.

17:30.531 --> 17:34.400
And you did.
Stow now I am completely

17:34.401 --> 17:36.002
bewildered bewildered.

17:36.003 --> 17:38.037
- I'm sold.
- Bewildered.

17:38.038 --> 17:43.009
There is an s. A. T. Word for you.
All right, well, Blake get your

17:43.010 --> 17:45.878
butt magically down here.
Good luck tonight.

17:45.879 --> 17:48.214
All right.
It's all on you at home,

17:48.215 --> 17:49.449
America.
So get to voting.

18:01.295 --> 18:04.530
What is going on over there at
the judge's desk.

18:04.531 --> 18:07.767
Ten votes for each act.
With each voting method.

18:07.768 --> 18:12.205
All of the voting lines will

18:12.206 --> 18:14.074
Tomorrow.
Stop horseplaying!

18:16.677 --> 18:21.848
Coming up ‐‐

18:21.849 --> 18:26.886
this is ‐‐
>> I had a premonition.

18:26.887 --> 18:29.164
Put it in the bottle.
Bust it open.

18:29.165 --> 18:29.189
Put it in the bottle.
Bust it open.

18:29.190 --> 18:34.161
It is going to be a butterfly.
>> That is crazy!

18:37.164 --> 18:41.311
This is why we made the show.
>> Being here means a lot.

18:54.752 --> 18:57.298
Welcome back to
"America's got talent."

18:57.299 --> 18:58.966
I have the best boss in the
world.

18:58.967 --> 19:02.270
Simon cowell.
This is the semifinals.

19:02.271 --> 19:05.072
And all of the act are fighting
for a place in the finals.

19:05.073 --> 19:07.675
No one wants it more than the
three musicians.

19:07.676 --> 19:10.811
They have had their struggles.
But when they come together and

19:10.812 --> 19:16.951
sing it is magic.
>> Before Ryan, I had been a

19:16.952 --> 19:17.059
single mom for a long time.
I thought "you know, I may not

19:17.060 --> 19:20.855
single mom for a long time.
I thought "you know, I may not

19:20.856 --> 19:25.359
find that person."
>> The first day that we met it

19:25.360 --> 19:28.729
was like fireworks basically.
We understood each other.

19:28.730 --> 19:32.500
His dad is a pastor.
My parents did evangelism.

19:32.501 --> 19:36.337
We both went through some
struggles.

19:36.338 --> 19:41.275
My teen pregnancy.
>> As a teenager I started to

19:41.276 --> 19:43.578
experiment with drugs and
alcohol.

19:43.579 --> 19:46.380
I came this close to death, you
know.

19:46.381 --> 19:47.059
And my faith brought me through
that night.

19:47.060 --> 19:48.816
And my faith brought me through
that night.

19:48.817 --> 19:51.786
We both had faith in god, the
faith to continue, our faith to

19:51.787 --> 19:57.358
not give up.
>> I was destined to be jazz's

19:57.359 --> 20:00.094
father.
I don't know why it took so long

20:00.095 --> 20:08.095
for us, for us all to find each
other.

20:11.006 --> 20:15.776
Yeah, I am just thankful.
>> We are this close to doing

20:15.777 --> 20:17.058
what we love to do and doing it
together.

20:17.059 --> 20:19.714
What we love to do and doing it
together.

20:19.715 --> 20:26.020
It's, it's a testament that, you
know, your life doesn't have to

20:26.021 --> 20:30.191
stay stuck in a bad situation.
>> You know, I really believe

20:30.192 --> 20:32.560
that nobody is perfect.
Everybody has been through hard

20:32.561 --> 20:35.963
things.
And amazing things can happen

Mr. Simon cowell.
Talk to them.

23:30.906 --> 23:33.974
First of all I want to
thank you for your honesty in

23:33.975 --> 23:36.477
what you said before.
Because I think what you said is

23:36.478 --> 23:38.913
very, very important.
How you can overcome things like

23:38.914 --> 23:43.284
this.
I think that you are one of the

23:43.285 --> 23:47.058
most improved acts I have seen
in the semifinals, semifinals.

23:47.059 --> 23:48.322
Most improved acts I have seen
in the semifinals, semifinals.

23:48.323 --> 23:50.024
Since we have done the live
shows.

23:50.025 --> 23:52.159
I think tonight the lyric was
perfect.

23:52.160 --> 23:54.962
You showed yourself as a group.
We got back to the big note with

23:54.963 --> 23:58.232
you again.
I think the song is going to

23:58.233 --> 24:00.167
resonate.
I am sitting here now thinking,

24:00.168 --> 24:02.903
I don't want to lose you.
I don't want to lose the first

24:02.904 --> 24:05.806
two acts.
So again, I hope America picks

24:05.807 --> 24:11.212
- up the phone and votes for you.
- Mel b.

24:11.213 --> 24:14.148
You know what, I was
literally sitting here and the

24:14.149 --> 24:17.058
- hairs on my arms were standing.
- And your back.

24:17.059 --> 24:19.520
- Hairs on my arms were standing.
- And your back.

24:19.521 --> 24:22.423
Stop it.
I didn't have a hairy back.

24:22.424 --> 24:24.558
You sing with such warmth and
passion.

24:24.559 --> 24:27.161
You are so going to get it,
Simon, shut up.

24:27.162 --> 24:29.396
This its about you.
This is your night.

24:29.397 --> 24:32.266
Like you have really stepped it
up a level.

24:32.267 --> 24:36.103
Rick, your harmonies, your
voice, the vocals blended.

24:36.104 --> 24:39.440
It was really good.
Thank you.

24:39.441 --> 24:42.810
- Howie?
- You talked about life,

24:42.811 --> 24:44.879
a journey, the show is a
journey.

24:44.880 --> 24:47.058
A reason for the journey.
The journey brought you

24:47.059 --> 24:47.215
a reason for the journey.
The journey brought you

24:47.216 --> 24:48.849
altogether.
We are so thrilled to be part of

24:48.850 --> 24:50.751
this journey.
It is beautiful, inspirational

24:50.752 --> 24:55.890
and wonderful.♪♪♪♪

24:55.891 --> 24:58.325
Yes, we are thrilled.
Good luck tonight.

24:58.326 --> 25:04.164
People you can vote online.
You can vote with the agt, pick

25:04.165 --> 25:06.033
up the phone.
However you do it.

25:06.034 --> 25:08.402
You have to vote.
A young comedian hopes he can

25:08.403 --> 25:12.406
take America by storm.
The pressure is on for Lori mae

25:12.407 --> 25:13.706
Hernandez.
When we come back.

25:27.554 --> 25:30.623
Welcome back to
"America's got talent."

25:30.624 --> 25:33.392
We are live from Hollywood!
Let's keep it going.

25:33.393 --> 25:37.630
Now, our next comedian started
writing jokes to make her dad

25:37.631 --> 25:40.399
laugh.
Now, she makes America laugh.

25:40.400 --> 25:44.436
For a spot in the finals, from
Lancaster, California, here is

25:44.437 --> 25:49.508
Lori mae Hernandez.
>> You are in danger of going

25:49.509 --> 25:50.152
home.
>> It is terrifying.

25:50.153 --> 25:57.650
Home.
>> It is terrifying.

25:57.651 --> 25:59.551
Because the I don't want to go
home.

25:59.552 --> 26:03.188
The act going through
to the semifinals is ‐‐

26:03.189 --> 26:07.426
Lori mae Hernandez!
>> I have never been as nervous

26:07.427 --> 26:11.597
in my life.
I don't want to feel that again.

26:11.598 --> 26:15.334
Thank you.
>> I'm not exactly a crier.

26:15.335 --> 26:20.151
But now that I cried on national
television, I guess I am kidded

26:20.152 --> 26:21.107
but now that I cried on national
television, I guess I am kidded

26:21.108 --> 26:23.342
akidded
‐‐ considered a crier now.

26:23.343 --> 26:28.447
Now in the semifinals in the
biggest talent show in the

26:28.448 --> 26:30.249
world.
I decided I want to train like

26:30.250 --> 26:34.420
an olympian.
Because this is my dream.

26:34.421 --> 26:41.260
It's been going okay.
Athleticism and coordination,

26:41.261 --> 26:44.263
has never been my thing.
But I have been working on my

26:44.264 --> 26:48.200
strength, my speed.
I want to become poetry in

26:48.201 --> 26:50.002
motion.
>> Come on, get up!

26:50.003 --> 26:50.152
Make it happen!
Whoo!

26:50.153 --> 26:53.172
Make it happen!
Whoo!

26:53.173 --> 26:57.142
There's my nonquitter.
>> This is the biggest moment of

26:57.143 --> 27:00.179
my life.
This is my Olympics.

27:00.180 --> 27:06.352
Michael Phelps, step aside,
because here comes Lori mae!

27:06.353 --> 27:08.220
Whoa!
>> Want to do if the again?

27:08.221 --> 27:16.221
No!

27:20.152 --> 27:25.471
No!

27:25.472 --> 27:31.410
Hi.
Give it up for our olympic

27:31.411 --> 27:35.247
athletes who won so much gold
our country is now out of debt.

27:35.248 --> 27:40.919
Yeah.
And, and, they did this while

27:40.920 --> 27:47.159
battling mosquitoes and bathroom
security.

27:47.160 --> 27:50.151
And hash tag girl power.
Yes.

27:50.152 --> 27:50.430
And hash tag girl power.
Yes.

27:50.431 --> 27:55.267
Yes.
Lori Hernandez is now an olympic

27:55.268 --> 28:01.540
champion.
Yeah.

28:01.541 --> 28:04.910
A different Lori.
All I ever won is the

28:04.911 --> 28:08.013
participation award,
translation, the I make your kid

28:08.014 --> 28:13.719
look great at sports award.
You can thank me later.

28:13.720 --> 28:18.123
And now, the secret is out.
There is more than one Lori

28:18.124 --> 28:20.151
Hernandez in the world.
And if you don't believe me,

28:20.152 --> 28:21.293
Hernandez in the world.
And if you don't believe me,

28:21.294 --> 28:29.294
just go to a quincenera.
But, look ‐‐ look, it's simple.

28:33.706 --> 28:35.808
Gymnast Lori grew up playing
sports.

28:35.809 --> 28:39.511
And this Lori grew up playing
Barbies.

28:39.512 --> 28:43.515
And just when I thought my
collection is complete, they

28:43.516 --> 28:50.151
come out with three new dolls.
Petite, tall and curvy Barbie.

28:50.152 --> 28:50.256
Come out with three new dolls.
Petite, tall and curvy Barbie.

28:50.257 --> 28:55.727
And I have had a few concerns
like where will new Barbie

28:55.728 --> 28:56.895
sleep?
The Malibu house is packed.

28:56.896 --> 28:58.597
They're already sleeping five to
a bed.

28:58.598 --> 29:03.235
And who will she date?
Ken has only seen one woman for

29:03.236 --> 29:09.041
over 50 years.
I ‐‐ I anticipate problems.

29:09.042 --> 29:12.778
And, most important, what will
new Barbie wear.

29:12.779 --> 29:15.948
She is not going to fit mine old
school Barbie clothes.

29:15.949 --> 29:20.151
That's as crazy as me sharing a
closet with Heidi Klum.

29:20.152 --> 29:23.355
That's as crazy as me sharing a
closet with Heidi Klum.

29:23.356 --> 29:29.628
And, if you want crazy, try
them?

29:29.629 --> 29:37.369
They're just Barbie gone bad.
You know like miley Cyrus.

29:37.370 --> 29:41.740
And let's face it, let's face
it, my Barbie days are over.

29:41.741 --> 29:46.845
Like American idol, the spice
girls, Howie's hair.

29:46.846 --> 29:50.151
I just ‐‐ I just outgrew, I just
outgrew Barbies.

29:50.152 --> 29:54.720
I just ‐‐ I just outgrew, I just
outgrew Barbies.

29:54.721 --> 30:01.493
Like Mariah did Nick.
Thank you!

30:01.494 --> 30:09.494
- Thank you!
- Lori mae Hernandez.

30:18.311 --> 30:20.151
This young lady is hilarious.
Howie?

30:20.152 --> 30:22.848
This young lady is hilarious.
Howie?

30:22.849 --> 30:27.019
- You got to talk to her, man.
- Lori mae, you are a

30:27.020 --> 30:28.020
star.
Adorable.

30:28.021 --> 30:31.056
I think you are a star.
If I have one piece of

30:31.057 --> 30:33.725
constructive criticism, it is
that I think you got to work on

30:33.726 --> 30:36.695
your material.
That last joke was brilliant.

30:36.696 --> 30:39.364
But I think you got to work on
the material the I have the

30:39.365 --> 30:42.200
opportunity to go out to clubs
and see how audiences.

30:42.201 --> 30:45.270
You don't have that.
You may want to go to outside.

30:45.271 --> 30:47.339
Lucky enough to get a vote and
move on.

30:47.340 --> 30:50.151
Go to outside writers and get
material, material, material.

30:50.152 --> 30:52.578
Go to outside writers and get
material, material, material.

30:52.579 --> 30:56.214
That last joke was
definitely great material.

30:56.215 --> 30:58.684
- Heidi.
- I do like how you jump

30:58.685 --> 31:00.886
from one topic to the next so
smoothly.

31:00.887 --> 31:04.022
With your age, I feel like that
is usually seasoned comedians

31:04.023 --> 31:06.325
that can do that.
I do think every time I see you,

31:06.326 --> 31:08.727
you get better.
So do your jokes.

31:08.728 --> 31:14.967
- So good for you!
- Simon cowell.

31:14.968 --> 31:17.603
I think this is your
best actually performance yet.

31:17.604 --> 31:20.151
I really do.
What I like about you, is that

31:20.152 --> 31:20.974
I really do.
What I like about you, is that

31:20.975 --> 31:23.909
you are edgy, and you're
fearless.

31:23.910 --> 31:26.378
And that last joke about Nick
and Mariah.

31:26.379 --> 31:32.618
That really made me laugh.
>> I told you, so much, I

31:32.619 --> 31:35.887
- respect you.
- Yeah, a couple times.

31:35.888 --> 31:40.025
- Mel b?
- We all just got served,

31:40.026 --> 31:41.193
- literally.
- Very true.

31:41.194 --> 31:44.262
You know what it was?
I like the insults at the end.

31:44.263 --> 31:46.565
At the beginning you kind of
lost me a bit.

31:46.566 --> 31:50.035
I wanted you to be funnier, I
know you are way more moneyer

31:50.036 --> 31:50.152
than that.
But you served us as the end.

31:50.153 --> 31:51.937
Than that.
But you served us as the end.

31:51.938 --> 31:56.875
So you did it.
>> Thank you.

31:56.876 --> 31:59.845
Me and you are going to
talk backstage, young lady.

31:59.846 --> 32:01.780
Good luck tonight.
You are awesome.

32:01.781 --> 32:04.049

Mel b. You are smiling.
Talk to them.

I am smiling, I am, I mean,
oh, I love you guys.

36:43.863 --> 36:46.498
To love where you come from.
I love your strength and your

36:46.499 --> 36:48.500
passion.
But I have to say for me

36:48.501 --> 36:52.304
tonight, that just felt like a
well rehearsed school

36:52.305 --> 36:57.208
performance.
It did not feel like a big

36:57.209 --> 37:00.845
"America's got talent"
performance.

37:00.846 --> 37:01.049
I know you are strong vocalists.
I wanted something better than

37:01.050 --> 37:03.915
I know you are strong vocalists.
I wanted something better than

37:03.916 --> 37:07.919
that.
It wasn't good enough for me

37:07.920 --> 37:10.822
- tonight.
- How do you feel?

37:10.823 --> 37:13.325
Technically you might
not be as good as some of the

37:13.326 --> 37:16.127
other singers on the stage.
But I do have this connection

37:16.128 --> 37:18.330
with you guys when you sing.
I just do.

37:18.331 --> 37:20.165
You make me feel great.
I love your story.

37:20.166 --> 37:22.968
I love your message.
And I hope that America feels

37:22.969 --> 37:25.170
the same way I do.
I feel great.

37:25.171 --> 37:28.707
I kind of like want to snuggle
up in Simon's chest hair and

37:28.708 --> 37:31.048
take a nap.
You make me feel good.

37:31.049 --> 37:31.510
Take a nap.
You make me feel good.

37:31.511 --> 37:35.080
- You would do that?
- No, I am kidding.

37:35.081 --> 37:37.882
I am not going to say
this is the best vocal

37:37.883 --> 37:40.585
performance I ever had.
Actually your film touched me

37:40.586 --> 37:42.887
more than the performance.
What you said.

37:42.888 --> 37:44.656
Again, it is really, really
important.

37:44.657 --> 37:47.392
But you know what you have come
a long way from when we first

37:47.393 --> 37:50.762
saw you.
And you are one of those acts

37:50.763 --> 37:55.734
that every time I see you like,
Heidi said, makes me feel good.

37:55.735 --> 37:57.869
It makes me feel good that you
are here.

37:57.870 --> 38:00.638
I think I would feel even better
if you were here in two weeks

38:00.639 --> 38:01.049
- time.
- Howie?

38:01.050 --> 38:09.050
- Time.
- Howie?

38:09.081 --> 38:10.582
One word.
Inspirational.

38:10.583 --> 38:14.185
That's what it was.
Very inspirational.

38:14.186 --> 38:18.156

minutes to turn this stage
around for one of most dangerous

38:43.282 --> 38:44.449
acts we have ever seen on the
show.

38:44.450 --> 38:46.185
So stay right there.

This is "America's got

39:01.133 --> 39:02.801
talent."
The semifinals.

39:02.802 --> 39:10.802
Now over the years, singers,
ventriloquists, individually

39:11.377 --> 39:13.211
artists to dogs.
If you have a talent.

39:13.212 --> 39:16.448
You think America would love it.
Show us what you have got.

39:16.449 --> 39:19.050
We will be on the road for next
season very soon.

39:19.051 --> 39:21.829
Go to agt auditions. Com to find

It could change your life.
All right.

39:28.527 --> 39:33.231
That's all for next year.
This year, we have an 11 acts

39:33.232 --> 39:34.899
fighting for a place in the
finals.

39:34.900 --> 39:38.903
Next up, a husband and wife from
las Vegas, Nevada.

39:38.904 --> 39:41.806
Who risked everything every time
they performed.

39:41.807 --> 39:46.277
What do they do?
The clue is in their name.

39:46.278 --> 39:50.716
Please don't try this at home.
Here is deadly games.

39:53.619 --> 39:58.056
We cam from very different
backgrounds.

39:58.057 --> 40:03.461
I come from a long line of
performers.

40:03.462 --> 40:07.832
And watching the dangerous
suspense together the they were

40:07.833 --> 40:10.535
my heroes.
>> When I was a little girl I

40:10.536 --> 40:17.442
dreamed of being a ballerina.
I fell in love with the Grace

40:17.443 --> 40:21.829
and beauty of the dance.
Even though I love ballet, I all

40:21.830 --> 40:23.281
and beauty of the dance.
Even though I love ballet, I all

40:23.282 --> 40:28.153
wade dreamt of doing something
dangerous, exciting.

40:28.154 --> 40:30.889
So when we met and Anna saw
what I could do.

40:30.890 --> 40:34.959
She said, yes, I want to be part
of it.

40:34.960 --> 40:39.063
What we do is a combination of
beauty and danger.

40:39.064 --> 40:44.068
Light and darkness.
And the two words coming

40:44.069 --> 40:50.408
together that creates the magic.
>> It is like lighting a fire.

40:50.409 --> 40:51.829
Again!
>> Anna is the most precious

40:51.830 --> 40:53.578
again!
>> Anna is the most precious

40:53.579 --> 40:56.447
person in the world to me.
Actually I am the scared one.

40:56.448 --> 41:00.618
She is the brave one.
I have this thought that I could

41:00.619 --> 41:04.923
lose her any second.
Every time we perform, that

41:04.924 --> 41:09.327
could be the last time I could
have Anna.

41:09.328 --> 41:17.328
Our future depend on this.
There is no room for mistake.

Heidi.

44:36.168 --> 44:40.204
You are still clapping, standing
ovation.

44:40.205 --> 44:47.378
- Talk to him.
- Would I love to be a

44:47.379 --> 44:50.214
fly on your bedroom wall, I kind
of would.

44:50.215 --> 44:51.829
That was so scary, and so hot, I
loved it.

44:51.830 --> 44:53.518
That was so scary, and so hot, I
loved it.

44:53.519 --> 44:56.721
I could not imagine a finale
without you guys.

44:56.722 --> 45:00.191
You have to be in the finale.
I hope that America will vote

45:00.192 --> 45:02.927
for you guys.
Loved it!

45:02.928 --> 45:04.395
- >> Thank you.
- Simon.

45:04.396 --> 45:07.398
You know, importantly
on the shows is the progression

45:07.399 --> 45:10.535
we have to judge on.
And, we have seen this act now,

45:10.536 --> 45:13.337
two, three times now.
I think the production is

45:13.338 --> 45:16.307
getting better.
What's so impressive is normally

45:16.308 --> 45:19.343
the person being thrown at is
invisible.

45:19.344 --> 45:21.829
You are as important as he is.
And that's why the act is so

45:21.830 --> 45:23.548
you are as important as he is.
And that's why the act is so

45:23.549 --> 45:25.616
good.
And, as we have seen on the

45:25.617 --> 45:28.986
show, things do go wrong with
cross bows.

45:28.987 --> 45:33.090
So, you put your life on the
line.

45:33.091 --> 45:34.826
Congratulations.
>> Thank you.

45:34.827 --> 45:37.795
- Howie.
- It was everything.

45:37.796 --> 45:39.497
It was thrilling.
And your wife is so sexy.

45:39.498 --> 45:45.636
No, no.
And what you are able to do.

45:45.637 --> 45:48.873
And your wife is so sexy.
I want to just say.

45:48.874 --> 45:51.829
I want people, I would have
given you a standing ovation, if

45:51.830 --> 45:51.910
I want people, I would have
given you a standing ovation, if

45:51.911 --> 45:55.947

You know what?

46:00.352 --> 46:05.523
It is so obvious.
You need to be told off.

46:05.524 --> 46:09.160
- Sorry.
- You two clearly came

46:09.161 --> 46:11.162
here to slay.
You had that down pat.

46:11.163 --> 46:15.633
Can I just tell you, by far,
this its the my best performance

46:15.634 --> 46:17.568
of the night for me.
Well done.

46:17.569 --> 46:21.829
The best performance.

Well done.
Good luck tonight.

Only five acts can go into the
finals.

can't stop talking about him.

47:32.527 --> 47:36.964
Hey can this one take him all
the way to the finals.

47:36.965 --> 47:39.225

And I was taught to be very zen

is an NFL star/magician.

55:28.476 --> 55:31.945
- >> Great magician.
- Only on agt.

55:31.946 --> 55:32.906
From Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
here he is.

55:32.907 --> 55:36.750
From Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
here he is.

55:36.751 --> 55:39.720
As a boy I had two loves.
One was football.

55:39.721 --> 55:43.090
And one was magic.
>> Since I lost my mom as a kid.

55:43.091 --> 55:45.859
Magic gave me hope.
Magic gave me love.

55:45.860 --> 55:49.263
Majgic gave me life.
Both of these things made me who

55:49.264 --> 55:51.865
I am.
So now it is as if my whole life

55:51.866 --> 55:54.201
has come full circle.
And I am coming back to that

55:54.202 --> 55:58.538
moment where magic and football
meet on the same level.

55:58.539 --> 56:01.508
I have been able to perform at
the highest level for 14 years

56:01.509 --> 56:02.905
in the NFL.
And it is awesome.

56:02.906 --> 56:03.444
In the NFL.
And it is awesome.

56:03.445 --> 56:06.246
As you walk out of an NFL
tunnel, everything just becomes

56:06.247 --> 56:08.081
still.
It's the calm before the storm.

56:08.082 --> 56:13.587
Then as soon as you run out,
wham.

56:13.588 --> 56:17.090
77,000 people strong cheering,
screaming, taking their hands

56:17.091 --> 56:19.826
and banging them against the
metal seats.

56:19.827 --> 56:22.129
You hear that ding, ding.
You get that energy.

56:22.130 --> 56:25.065
Feels like an earthquake is
rumbling underneath the stadium

56:25.066 --> 56:28.135
like it will shatter and fall
apart.

56:28.136 --> 56:32.905
It is the greatest feeling ever.
>> Simon, bust it open.

56:32.906 --> 56:33.808
It is the greatest feeling ever.
>> Simon, bust it open.

56:33.809 --> 56:34.975
I never thought anything could
match that.

56:34.976 --> 56:37.077
Something being on the stage of
"America's got talent," it is

56:37.078 --> 56:39.913
the ultimate accomplishment.
When I stop out there tonight I

56:39.914 --> 56:45.218
am going to take that deep
breath, and feel the hairs come

56:45.219 --> 56:47.120
up off my arm.
The eerie silence.

56:47.121 --> 56:49.523
The calm before the storm.
When my eyes open.

56:49.524 --> 56:51.325
It is game time.
And I am going to love every

56:51.326 --> 56:55.495

hey, thanks for having me back.
Hey, I thought I would bring

57:05.206 --> 57:07.307
some props.
I got a huge map of America.

57:07.308 --> 57:10.978
I have a treasure chest my
grandparents gave me as a kid.

57:10.979 --> 57:13.780
I got this journal.
I want through intense therapy.

57:13.781 --> 57:15.349
I wrote everything in the
journal.

57:15.350 --> 57:17.651
Howie, this is important.
This is yours, hold on.

57:17.652 --> 57:19.419
You are responsible.
You got it, good.

57:19.420 --> 57:22.422
As you guys know, I am a long
snapper for the Philadelphia

57:22.423 --> 57:24.057
eagles.
If you don't know what that is.

57:24.058 --> 57:26.560
Hey, buddy.
If you don't know what that is.

57:26.561 --> 57:30.097
I look between my legs and snap
it to a guy that kicks it.

57:30.098 --> 57:32.165
Now here what is awesome,
classic.

57:32.166 --> 57:32.906
You four judges are going to
throw or snap to randomly picked

57:32.907 --> 57:35.535
you four judges are going to
throw or snap to randomly picked

57:35.536 --> 57:37.671
states on the map.
See numbers in the states.

57:37.672 --> 57:40.507
We will add those up.
Hopefully makes sense with the

57:40.508 --> 57:42.743
treasure and chest.
Simon, you are up first.

57:42.744 --> 57:45.212
Everybody stand up.
Line up behind Simon.

57:45.213 --> 57:47.080
Howie, hold the journal.
Walk around here.

57:47.081 --> 57:48.715
All righty.
I sort of know.

57:48.716 --> 57:50.917
Right here.
>> Till you what, hold on.

57:50.918 --> 57:53.487
Hold on.
I think we should let the crud

57:53.488 --> 57:55.722
decide.
Should he throw it or snap it?

57:55.723 --> 57:58.558
Throw it.
All right.

57:58.559 --> 58:00.293
All right.
I think they want to see you

58:00.294 --> 58:02.905
snap this thing.
>> Between my legs?

58:02.906 --> 58:03.064
Snap this thing.
>> Between my legs?

58:03.065 --> 58:05.465
Between your legs.
Let it rip.

58:05.466 --> 58:07.434
That's it.
>> Snap.

58:07.435 --> 58:11.338
Go like that.
>> Snap it!

58:11.339 --> 58:15.442
Okay, hold on.
Hold on.

58:15.443 --> 58:18.779
Simon, you missed an 8 x 12 foot
map.

58:18.780 --> 58:20.647
Impressive.
You can throw it.

58:20.648 --> 58:22.015
Throw it.
>> Perfect.

58:22.016 --> 58:24.251
Hold on.
Simon between Hawaii and Alaska.

58:24.252 --> 58:26.686
Where do you want to go.
>> Alaska.

58:26.687 --> 58:29.890
Alaska it is.
Simon is going to Alaska.

58:29.891 --> 58:32.292
We will enter 49 into the
calculator.

58:32.293 --> 58:32.906
We will add these up.
Heidi, you are up next.

58:32.907 --> 58:34.528
We will add these up.
Heidi, you are up next.

58:34.529 --> 58:39.366
Snap it or throw it?
It's up to you.

58:39.367 --> 58:41.435
I want to snap it?
>> She's in the game.

58:41.436 --> 58:46.973
She's in the game.
>> Yes!

58:46.974 --> 58:49.810
Yes!
Whoo‐hoo.

58:49.811 --> 58:57.811
Heidi, Heidi, unbelievable.
She hit Wyoming.

58:58.252 --> 59:00.454
44.
Heidi, you hit Wyoming.

59:00.455 --> 59:02.905
Mel b., throw it or snap it.
>> Snap it!

59:02.906 --> 59:03.858
Mel b., throw it or snap it.
>> Snap it!

59:03.859 --> 59:07.227
Throw it.
>> Simon, you guys can sit.

59:07.228 --> 59:09.863
Simon, Heidi, you guys can sit.
>> Oh, nice.

59:09.864 --> 59:14.334
Mel b is on Texas.
Mel b.

59:14.335 --> 59:16.636
Mel b., you are on Texas.
That's 28.

59:16.637 --> 59:21.374
Enter that in there.
Howie, you are the last one.

59:21.375 --> 59:25.579
Throw it.
>> Hold that journal.

59:25.580 --> 59:27.047
You got the journal.
>> You can throw it.

59:27.048 --> 59:29.182
Go.
>> Nice shot.

59:29.183 --> 59:30.717
Holy cow.
Howie, stay right there.

59:30.718 --> 59:32.905
Oklahoma.
Howie, stay right there.

59:32.906 --> 59:34.521
Oklahoma.
Howie, stay right there.

59:34.522 --> 59:37.257
You hit Oklahoma.
I need your help, buddy, Howie,

59:37.258 --> 59:38.925
I need your help.
>> Okay.

59:38.926 --> 59:40.994
Yeah, yeah, holding that
journal.

59:40.995 --> 59:44.865
Simon, Alaska.
Mel b., Texas.

59:44.866 --> 59:47.734
Howie, you are Oklahoma.
Heidi, Wyoming.

59:47.735 --> 59:49.569
You have been holding the
journal the whole time.

59:49.570 --> 59:51.571
The whole time.
>> Why is that important.

59:51.572 --> 59:53.773
I used to hide my key on the
back of it.

59:53.774 --> 59:55.742
Awful hiding spot.
Take the key.

59:55.743 --> 59:57.911
You are the only one that can
open this chest.

59:57.912 --> 59:59.713
Do me a favor.
Open that chest.

59:59.714 --> 1:00:01.848
Open the chest.
>> Okay.

1:00:01.849 --> 1:00:02.905
Beautiful.
Open that chest.

1:00:02.906 --> 1:00:03.718
Beautiful.
Open that chest.

1:00:03.719 --> 1:00:05.585
All right.
>> What do you see?

1:00:05.586 --> 1:00:08.054
The key is not working.
>> There.

1:00:08.055 --> 1:00:09.923
Go clockwise.
>> I am.

1:00:09.924 --> 1:00:12.826
There we go.
>> What do you see in there?

1:00:12.827 --> 1:00:15.295
Take out whatever you see.
>> This is important.

1:00:15.296 --> 1:00:17.030
Grab it all.
I want the judges.

1:00:17.031 --> 1:00:19.332
Everybody to see this.
Let's go to the desk.

1:00:19.333 --> 1:00:20.800
Beautiful.
Go to the desk.

1:00:20.801 --> 1:00:22.035
Yes.
>> I'm going.

1:00:22.036 --> 1:00:23.803
Yes, yes, yes.
Have a seat.

1:00:23.804 --> 1:00:25.872
Have a seat.
>> All right.

1:00:25.873 --> 1:00:28.074
All right.
Throw the change on the journal.

1:00:28.075 --> 1:00:30.810
Change on the journal.
Added up all the states.

1:00:30.811 --> 1:00:32.905
Came out to 167.
Mel b., what if we have $1.67.

1:00:32.906 --> 1:00:36.249
Came out to 167.
Mel b., what if we have $1.67.

1:00:36.250 --> 1:00:38.818
Count it out loud.
>> Yes, we do.

1:00:38.819 --> 1:00:42.556
There is $1.67.
What is that?

1:00:42.557 --> 1:00:45.392
What is that?
>> $1.67.

1:00:45.393 --> 1:00:47.427
How do you do that?
>> No.

1:00:47.428 --> 1:00:48.129
Wait.
Wait.

1:00:48.130 --> 1:00:53.066
I don't know what it is.
That is $1.10.

1:00:53.067 --> 1:00:58.338
$1.11.
>> These are two

1:00:58.339 --> 1:01:01.374
penny.
>> In America, we put states on

1:01:01.375 --> 1:01:02.905
the backs of quarters.
States.

1:01:02.906 --> 1:01:04.244
The backs of quarters.
States.

1:01:04.245 --> 1:01:05.979
Howie.
Do me a favor.

1:01:05.980 --> 1:01:08.582
Pick one quarter up.
What state is on the back of

1:01:08.583 --> 1:01:09.583
that.
Hold it up?

1:01:09.584 --> 1:01:12.652
This one is, Alaska.
>> There you go.

1:01:12.653 --> 1:01:14.955
Simon.
Simon.

1:01:14.956 --> 1:01:18.291
Simon, went to Alaska.
Simon went to Alaska.

1:01:18.292 --> 1:01:20.060
Give me another one.
Another one.

1:01:20.061 --> 1:01:22.295
Really?
>> Read another one.

1:01:22.296 --> 1:01:23.563
Quick.
>> I'm trying.

1:01:23.564 --> 1:01:26.066
This one is Wyoming.
>> Wyoming.

1:01:26.067 --> 1:01:28.835
Heidi went to Wyoming.
>> There you go.

1:01:28.836 --> 1:01:31.871
Mel b., give him a quarter.
>> Give me the quarter.

1:01:31.872 --> 1:01:32.905
Give me the quarter.
Have to hurry this.

1:01:32.906 --> 1:01:33.874
Give me the quarter.
Have to hurry this.

1:01:33.875 --> 1:01:36.743
Yes.
>> This one is ‐‐ what can you

1:01:36.744 --> 1:01:44.744
steep what this one is?
This one is, wait, wait.

1:01:45.319 --> 1:01:46.886
Texas sclamt Texas!

1:01:46.887 --> 1:01:48.054
Mel b. Went to Texas.
The last one is Hawaii.

1:01:48.055 --> 1:01:48.956
Now check this out.
Mel b.

1:01:48.957 --> 1:01:50.890
There is a journal there.
I keep all my secrets in the

1:01:50.891 --> 1:01:51.792
journal.
Open that up.

1:01:51.793 --> 1:01:53.226
Hurry up.
Open it up.

1:01:53.227 --> 1:01:55.395
Open it up.
Open it up.

1:01:55.396 --> 1:01:57.998
Yeah, yeah.
Look, there is a map in there.

1:01:57.999 --> 1:02:00.667
Why is this important.
This map wasn't for me as a kid.

1:02:00.668 --> 1:02:02.905
It was for you guys.
Simon, you would find your way

1:02:02.906 --> 1:02:04.037
it was for you guys.
Simon, you would find your way

1:02:04.038 --> 1:02:07.607
to Alaska.
Mel b, you would get to Texas.

1:02:07.608 --> 1:02:10.577
Heidi, you always wanted to go
to Wyoming.

1:02:10.578 --> 1:02:15.515
I till you what.
There you are, Howie going to

1:02:15.516 --> 1:02:16.350
Oklahoma.
Peace out, baby.

1:02:16.351 --> 1:02:20.687
Go birds!
Thank you!

1:02:20.688 --> 1:02:24.791
We don't know how he does it.
>> Thank you.

1:02:24.792 --> 1:02:32.792
But he does it very well.
Heidi still on her feet.

1:02:32.906 --> 1:02:33.668
But he does it very well.
Heidi still on her feet.

1:02:33.669 --> 1:02:37.804
Howie trying to figure it out.
Talk to him.

1:02:37.805 --> 1:02:40.473
That was amazing.
An amazing football player.

1:02:40.474 --> 1:02:42.609
An amazing.
I don't know how that is done.

1:02:42.610 --> 1:02:46.513
I am still, my jaw is dropping.
Also amazed at how good Heidi is

1:02:46.514 --> 1:02:52.585
- with balls between her legs.
- You are being ‐‐

1:02:52.586 --> 1:02:55.555
quite mischievous tonight.
Mel b.

1:02:55.556 --> 1:02:57.257
I was kind of speechless.

1:02:57.258 --> 1:02:59.659
I don't know how you were doing
it all.

1:02:59.660 --> 1:03:01.728
And I knew what I hoped you were
going to do.

1:03:01.729 --> 1:03:02.905
And you did it.
Purely is magical.

1:03:02.906 --> 1:03:05.298
And you did it.
Purely is magical.

1:03:05.299 --> 1:03:07.834
Absolutely magical.
>> Thank you.

1:03:07.835 --> 1:03:12.205
Heidi.
>> John, this was your best

1:03:12.206 --> 1:03:14.207
touchdown yet!
>> Thank you.

1:03:14.208 --> 1:03:15.809
It really was.
You rock.

1:03:15.810 --> 1:03:18.712
You are fantastic.
I love your delivery.

1:03:18.713 --> 1:03:19.513
Always fun.
I love you.

1:03:19.514 --> 1:03:23.049
- >> Thank you.
- Simon.

1:03:23.050 --> 1:03:26.319
- Still trying to figure it out.
- Can I say something,

1:03:26.320 --> 1:03:29.889
John, this is the most
incredible thing I have seen on

1:03:29.890 --> 1:03:31.257
one of these shows.
Genuinely.

1:03:31.258 --> 1:03:32.905
I mean, I just ‐‐ this is not a
trick.

1:03:32.906 --> 1:03:35.428
I mean, I just ‐‐ this is not a
trick.

1:03:35.429 --> 1:03:38.531
And I absolutely love the fact,
John, that you come here with

1:03:38.532 --> 1:03:41.735
the successful career, but you,
come here to win.

1:03:41.736 --> 1:03:45.405
And that's what I love about
you.

1:03:45.406 --> 1:03:47.307
And you had very little time to
do this.

1:03:47.308 --> 1:03:49.275
You had to get the whole thing
together.

1:03:49.276 --> 1:03:51.511
It was chaotic.
I am watching this in front of

1:03:51.512 --> 1:03:55.315
me.
I think you are a genius.

1:03:55.316 --> 1:03:58.084
- >> Thank you.
- John, Simon said you

1:03:58.085 --> 1:04:00.453
come here to win.
You come out here with such

1:04:00.454 --> 1:04:02.655
amazing energy.
Where does that all come from?

1:04:02.656 --> 1:04:02.906
For the love of performing.
An audience here unbelievable.

1:04:02.907 --> 1:04:06.292
For the love of performing.
An audience here unbelievable.

1:04:06.293 --> 1:04:09.596
You have given us an opportunity
to entertain you guys.

1:04:09.597 --> 1:04:11.931
That's what this is about.
The greatest show on television.

1:04:11.932 --> 1:04:16.035
- Thank you for the opportunity.
- Good luck, man.

1:04:16.036 --> 1:04:18.705
To vote for John.
Hit the phones.

1:04:18.706 --> 1:04:22.008
You have until 7:00 a. M. Eastern
tomorrow.

1:04:22.009 --> 1:04:26.679
So make sure the acts you want
to see in the finals get there.

1:04:26.680 --> 1:04:29.783
Coming up, dancers from
Argentina tear up the stage.

1:04:29.784 --> 1:04:32.905
And a 12‐year‐old ukulele star
hopes to sing and play her way

1:04:32.906 --> 1:04:34.487
and a 12‐year‐old ukulele star
hopes to sing and play her way

1:04:34.488 --> 1:04:35.888
off to the finals.
Stay right there.

1:04:53.107 --> 1:04:56.176
> Welcome back to "America's
got talent."

1:04:56.177 --> 1:04:58.311
The semifinals.
We are live from Hollywood.

1:04:58.312 --> 1:05:03.049
Right now, here is a young girl
who sings and plays the ukulele,

1:05:03.050 --> 1:05:06.386
she is 12 years old and she's
got the entire country talking

1:05:06.387 --> 1:05:11.324
about her.
Sheer is Grace vanderwaal.

1:05:11.325 --> 1:05:14.661
Hi, Grace.
>> A year ago I was in the

1:05:14.662 --> 1:05:15.248
marching band.
No one knew I sang.

1:05:15.249 --> 1:05:16.496
Marching band.
No one knew I sang.

1:05:16.497 --> 1:05:20.834
And this entire experience has
just been amazing honestly.

1:05:20.835 --> 1:05:24.571
It changed my life forever, I
think.

1:05:24.572 --> 1:05:28.007
It feels like I am a famous
person or something.

1:05:28.008 --> 1:05:31.077
I'm not, don't worry.
>> I love this shirt!

1:05:31.078 --> 1:05:36.049
I feel like a princess there.
And there is so much talent in

1:05:36.050 --> 1:05:39.519
the semifinal.
I was always afraid that I

1:05:39.520 --> 1:05:42.622
wasn't a good singer.
>> We're all going to remember

1:05:42.623 --> 1:05:45.191
when we saw Grace sing live for
the first time.

1:05:45.192 --> 1:05:45.248
I never imagined I could win.
But, every single day, I want it

1:05:45.249 --> 1:05:50.563
I never imagined I could win.
But, every single day, I want it

1:05:50.564 --> 1:05:53.800
more and more badly.
And I don't know why.

1:05:53.801 --> 1:05:58.938
I feel like I am a flower just
like going like this.

1:05:58.939 --> 1:06:03.109
And I am more motivated every
single day to write more songs.

1:06:03.110 --> 1:06:06.312
The song I am doing tonight is
just about letting yourself

1:06:06.313 --> 1:06:07.680
shine.
That's what I am trying how to

1:06:07.681 --> 1:06:13.019
do for the semifinals.
I am just trying to shine.

1:06:13.020 --> 1:06:15.247

I think we all just witnessed
something special.

1:09:12.366 --> 1:09:15.247
A true light in the sky.
Wow.

1:09:15.248 --> 1:09:15.402

Wow.

Grace, Grace, Grace.
Now, let me ask you was that

1:09:21.375 --> 1:09:25.078
your own song that you wrote?
>> Yes.

1:09:25.079 --> 1:09:28.915
Grace.
I mean ‐‐ you're 12 years old.

1:09:28.916 --> 1:09:33.886
You have such a unique voice.
And you are so in control of

1:09:33.887 --> 1:09:35.621
everything.
At 12 years old.

1:09:35.622 --> 1:09:39.859
You are already a superstar.
And you, you just, it's like ‐‐

1:09:39.860 --> 1:09:44.197

- Heidi.
- Grace, you are a super

1:09:53.874 --> 1:09:56.709

I would not be surprised if you

are one of last two people
standing here in this

1:10:00.881 --> 1:10:01.715

1:10:01.716 --> 1:10:05.852
- That is my prediction.
- Mr. Simon cowell.

1:10:05.853 --> 1:10:07.620
This is very simple, Grace.

1:10:07.621 --> 1:10:09.489
Everything has worked because it
comes from you.

1:10:09.490 --> 1:10:11.057
I know every idea comes from
you.

1:10:11.058 --> 1:10:13.326

1:10:13.327 --> 1:10:15.247
I think you sing for a new
generation.

1:10:15.248 --> 1:10:16.063
I think you sing for a new
generation.

1:10:16.064 --> 1:10:19.599
And I am so flattered and
thrilled that you decided to

And now I hope, America, which
is really important, don't take

1:10:26.507 --> 1:10:28.508
this for granted.
I hope they really pick up the

1:10:28.509 --> 1:10:31.778
phone and put you where you
deserve to be in two week's time

1:10:31.779 --> 1:10:36.716

Last time these guys were on the

Well, first they got to make it

1:12:18.252 --> 1:12:24.457

Here's malevo, dance crew.

1:12:24.458 --> 1:12:28.227
Dance is everything to us.

from hard times.
It also represents hope, hope

1:12:30.497 --> 1:12:34.133
for us, our families.
The main sacrifice I think we

1:12:34.134 --> 1:12:38.572
are making to be here is missing
our families.

1:12:39.306 --> 1:12:42.208
I miss my kids very much.
Very much.

1:12:42.209 --> 1:12:44.810
I have a daughter.
She is 7 years old.

1:12:44.811 --> 1:12:47.914
And a son he is 3.
My daughter told me saw me on

1:12:47.915 --> 1:12:49.148
TV.
You are famous, daddy.

1:12:49.149 --> 1:12:57.149
I know she is proud of me.
It is hard to be away from

1:12:58.025 --> 1:12:58.714

1:16:46.186 --> 1:16:48.988
I said this earlier on.

What I am seeing this year is
this willingness to win, this

1:16:51.992 --> 1:16:54.393
willingness to get better.
I don't think you could have

1:16:54.394 --> 1:16:57.129

This is a night because of you

1:17:14.481 --> 1:17:17.249
There is a lot of whips, water
and sexiness.

1:17:17.250 --> 1:17:20.920
People are going to remember

1:17:20.921 --> 1:17:26.258

We have one more act to see, a
young opera singer the she has a

1:17:38.738 --> 1:17:40.940
big stage set up.
But the stage will be ready.

1:17:40.941 --> 1:17:43.442
Our crew is great.
She will be ready as well.

It is Laura bretan when we

1:17:57.705 --> 1:18:02.079
Welcome back.

1:18:02.080 --> 1:18:06.483
We are live from Hollywood!
The acts are all fighting for a

1:18:06.484 --> 1:18:09.753
spot in this season's finals.
Everything depend on how you

1:18:09.754 --> 1:18:12.222

We'll find out who made it.

1:18:12.223 --> 1:18:16.393
We will be joined throughout the

1:18:16.394 --> 1:18:21.165
illusionist, that's all tomorrow
night at 9:00, 8:00 central.

1:18:21.166 --> 1:18:23.635
It will be an epic show.
Here is our last act of the

1:18:23.636 --> 1:18:24.335
it will be an epic show.
Here is our last act of the

1:18:24.336 --> 1:18:26.970
night.
She is a young opera singer

1:18:26.971 --> 1:18:29.706
whose passion for music comes
from family and the heartache

1:18:29.707 --> 1:18:34.378
that that can bring.
Here is Laura bretan.

1:18:34.379 --> 1:18:37.881
Growing up my grandfather
used to live with us.

1:18:37.882 --> 1:18:41.018
Every day I would come home from
school, he would be waiting for

1:18:41.019 --> 1:18:46.490
me on the doorstep.
We would listen to opera and he

1:18:46.491 --> 1:18:48.792
really encouraged me to sing to
him.

1:18:48.793 --> 1:18:53.635
And he was like my best friend.
Last year he got really sick.

1:18:53.636 --> 1:18:56.066
And he was like my best friend.
Last year he got really sick.

1:18:56.067 --> 1:18:59.970
I would hold his hand and let
him know that everything was

1:18:59.971 --> 1:19:06.410
going to be okay.
And he would just say, keep on

1:19:06.411 --> 1:19:12.015
going for your dream.
Do what you love to do.

1:19:12.016 --> 1:19:20.016
And in January, he passed away.
It was just so hard for me and

1:19:22.460 --> 1:19:23.635
it still is very hard.
But he wanted to see me

1:19:23.636 --> 1:19:31.635
it still is very hard.
But he wanted to see me

1:19:31.636 --> 1:19:34.304
following my dream.
I think he would be so proud

1:19:34.305 --> 1:19:39.810
that I have made it this far.
And the song that I am about to

1:19:39.811 --> 1:19:44.982
sing was one of his favorites.
I will be imagining my

1:19:44.983 --> 1:19:47.784
grandfather there in the
audience and that I could be

1:19:47.785 --> 1:19:53.424
able to hold his hand again like
I did when I was younger.

1:21:58.149 --> 1:22:02.552
Laura bretan.
Everyone on their feet.

1:22:02.553 --> 1:22:08.325
Let me help you down.
Simon.

1:22:08.326 --> 1:22:15.265
Talk to Laura, please, Mr.
Cowell.

1:22:15.266 --> 1:22:23.266
Laura, that just says it all.

1:22:23.636 --> 1:22:24.741
Laura, that just says it all.

1:22:24.742 --> 1:22:28.512
Laura, just remind me you are 13
years old, right?

1:22:28.513 --> 1:22:32.349
- >> I turned 14 in April.
- Big difference.

1:22:32.350 --> 1:22:35.385
14 years old.
Laura, I think, not think, I

1:22:35.386 --> 1:22:37.921
know this was the best vocal
performance you have given so

1:22:37.922 --> 1:22:41.291
far in the competition.
It was beautiful.

1:22:41.292 --> 1:22:46.730
It was so well measured.
It was done with such sincerity.

1:22:46.731 --> 1:22:50.434
And you know, we have forgotten
about you a little bit from the

1:22:50.435 --> 1:22:53.370
first audition.
You have just come back with an

1:22:53.371 --> 1:22:53.636
explosive performance.
If you're not in the finals

1:22:53.637 --> 1:22:56.306
explosive performance.
If you're not in the finals

1:22:56.307 --> 1:22:58.842
something has gone seriously,
seriously wrong after that.

1:22:58.843 --> 1:23:03.914
- >> Thank you so much.
- Heidi.

1:23:03.915 --> 1:23:07.451
Laura, Laura, what can
I say you hit all the right

1:23:07.452 --> 1:23:09.619
notes.
And you are blessed with such a

1:23:09.620 --> 1:23:12.055
strong and such a beautiful
voice.

1:23:12.056 --> 1:23:15.225
You continuously take my breath
away.

1:23:15.226 --> 1:23:17.327
- >> Thank you.
- Love it.

1:23:17.328 --> 1:23:20.430
- Mel b.
- Regardless whether you

1:23:20.431 --> 1:23:23.635
are a fan of this genre of music
or not what you can do, your

1:23:23.636 --> 1:23:24.768
are a fan of this genre of music
or not what you can do, your

1:23:24.769 --> 1:23:27.337
vocal ability its just
outstanding.

1:23:27.338 --> 1:23:30.507
I mean, you literally tear this
roof off.

1:23:30.508 --> 1:23:32.843
You are such a small, tiny
little person.

1:23:32.844 --> 1:23:34.611
And then this big voice comes
out.

1:23:34.612 --> 1:23:36.580
It is flawless.
Well done.

1:23:36.581 --> 1:23:40.884
- >> Thank you.
- Howie.

1:23:40.885 --> 1:23:44.354
You know, I always am
kind of, I question what it is

1:23:44.355 --> 1:23:47.090
like at home.
Because ultimately this is up to

1:23:47.091 --> 1:23:48.792
America.
America has got to vote.

1:23:48.793 --> 1:23:51.728
Just because they see or hear
something fantastic, it doesn't

1:23:51.729 --> 1:23:53.635
happen unless they make that
move.

1:23:53.636 --> 1:23:53.831
Happen unless they make that
move.

1:23:53.832 --> 1:23:57.167
So what I want to tell America,
because I am sitting here in the

1:23:57.168 --> 1:23:59.703
room, not sitting there with
you, is not only do you hear

1:23:59.704 --> 1:24:03.473
this voice, not only do you hear
this talent, but you feel her

1:24:03.474 --> 1:24:05.308
heart, you feel it.
I hope that translates through

1:24:05.309 --> 1:24:09.312
the screen.
So I am asking America to vote.

1:24:09.313 --> 1:24:14.651
This was an OMG night.
Thank you.

1:24:14.652 --> 1:24:17.020
- >> Thank you.
- Such passion.

1:24:17.021 --> 1:24:20.190
Such emotion.
What do you want to say?

1:24:20.191 --> 1:24:23.635
That, I know what it feels
like to lose some one you love,

1:24:23.636 --> 1:24:24.262
that, I know what it feels
like to lose some one you love,

1:24:24.263 --> 1:24:26.396
just keep doing what you love.
And be strong through all of

1:24:26.397 --> 1:24:32.836
- this.
- You are doing what you

1:24:32.837 --> 1:24:34.838
love tonight.
Who do you want to see in the

1:24:34.839 --> 1:24:36.706
finals?
Vying for $1 million.

1:24:36.707 --> 1:24:40.944
Voting is open now.
Will stay open until 7:00 a. M.

1:24:40.945 --> 1:24:41.879
Tomorrow.
Get your votes in.

1:24:41.880 --> 1:24:44.815
Tomorrow night, the crucial
votes.

1:24:44.816 --> 1:24:49.786
And the acts that go through
tootto

1:24:49.787 --> 1:24:53.457
the finals.
We will see you then.

1:24:53.458 --> 1:24:53.636
Don't move.
Coming up, right now, it is

1:24:53.637 --> 1:24:57.127
don't move.
Coming up, right now, it is

1:24:57.128 --> 1:24:58.928
"better late than never."
Good night, America.
