00:40.040 --> 00:42.959
l have a friend, Deborah,
a psychologist...

00:43.127 --> 00:45.294
...who was asked
by the city of Philadelphia...

00:45.462 --> 00:49.549
...if she could offer psychological
counseling to Cambodian refugees...

00:49.717 --> 00:53.261
...boat people,
who had recently arrived in the city.

00:53.429 --> 00:56.556
Deborah was daunted by the task.
These Cambodians...

00:56.724 --> 01:01.728
...had suffered genocide, starvation,
relatives murdered before their eyes...

01:01.895 --> 01:05.648
...years in refugee camps,
harrowing boat trips to the West.

01:06.108 --> 01:07.984
How could she relate
to their suffering?

01:08.152 --> 01:09.819
How could she help these people?

01:16.201 --> 01:18.703
So guess what all these people
wanted to talk about...

01:18.871 --> 01:21.622
...with my friend Deborah,
the psychologist.

01:23.709 --> 01:26.544
lt was all,
"l met this guy in the refugee camp.

01:26.712 --> 01:29.547
I thought he really loved me,
but when we got separated...

01:29.715 --> 01:32.300
...he took up with my cousin.
Now he says he loves me...

01:32.468 --> 01:35.928
...and keeps calling me. They're
married now. What should l do?"

01:36.096 --> 01:37.180
This is how we are.

01:37.347 --> 01:38.556
May I help you?

01:38.724 --> 01:41.392
I'm Liz Gilbert. I'm writing
a magazine article on Bali.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.019
I wanted to meet a medicine man.

01:43.187 --> 01:46.272
Everyone said I should meet
Ketut Liyer. Am l in the right place?

01:46.440 --> 01:47.523
Wait.

01:47.691 --> 01:52.028
l mean, here I am with
a ninth-generation medicine man...

01:52.196 --> 01:54.697
...and what do I wanna
ask him about?

01:54.865 --> 01:57.200
Getting closer to God?

01:57.367 --> 02:00.912
Saving the world's
starving children?

02:01.663 --> 02:04.207
Happy to see you. l am Ketut Liyer.

02:04.374 --> 02:09.294
Nope. l wanna discuss
my relationship.

02:12.591 --> 02:15.134
You are a world traveler.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.386
You will live a long time...

02:17.554 --> 02:20.890
...have many friends,
many experiences.

02:22.476 --> 02:26.145
You will have two marriages.
One long, one short.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.272
Am l in the long one
or the short one?

02:28.816 --> 02:30.358
Can't tell.

02:30.526 --> 02:34.487
Also you will lose all your money.

02:35.572 --> 02:38.825
I think in next six to 1 0 months.

02:40.118 --> 02:43.204
Don't worry.
You will get it all back again.

02:43.914 --> 02:46.290
And you will come back to Bali...

02:46.458 --> 02:52.755
...and live here for three or four
months and teach me English.

02:52.923 --> 02:56.384
I never had anybody
to practice my English with.

02:57.135 --> 02:58.719
And then...

02:58.887 --> 03:04.267
...l will teach you everything l know.

03:07.104 --> 03:08.938
Wait.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.069
I have this for you.

03:15.237 --> 03:18.698
Keep grounded so it's like
you have four legs.

03:19.116 --> 03:21.367
That way, you can stay in this world.

03:21.952 --> 03:25.913
Also, no looking at world
through your head.

03:26.081 --> 03:28.499
Look through your heart instead.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.793
That way, you will know God.

03:32.254 --> 03:34.463
Which is why you came here, no?

03:35.632 --> 03:39.051
See you later, alligator.

03:53.442 --> 03:56.819
I proofread all of her manuscripts.

03:56.987 --> 04:00.489
My wife is very, very beautiful,
but she can't spell for anything.

04:00.657 --> 04:03.326
Look at Uncle Stephen.

04:04.828 --> 04:05.995
And Auntie Liz.

04:06.163 --> 04:09.874
I'm counting the minutes for this to be
over so l can get in my big girl pants.

04:10.042 --> 04:12.001
You look fantastic.
You just had a baby.

04:12.169 --> 04:14.170
Oh, you're lying.
I'm fat, I'm exhausted...

04:14.338 --> 04:16.880
...l can't keep two thoughts.
I feel like Liza Minnelli.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.716
Stephen, can you hold Jack?

04:18.884 --> 04:21.218
-l'm gonna introduce you to Walter.
-Yeah.

04:22.012 --> 04:25.431
Hey, dude, you wanna grab a beer
or something?

04:25.682 --> 04:28.309
My new book comes out in April.
Thank you for asking.

04:28.477 --> 04:29.518
-Great.
-May.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.020
May. May.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.482
This is Andre. You two are
Times' Most Notable nominees.

04:34.650 --> 04:37.360
-So glad to finally meet you.
-Nice to finally meet you.

04:39.363 --> 04:41.072
I fed him nachos. ls that bad?

04:41.239 --> 04:43.741
You look comfortable.
What'd you feed him, chloroform?

04:43.909 --> 04:45.868
-Give him to his dad.
-l told you, nachos.

04:46.036 --> 04:48.579
Know what? I'd be asleep too
if l had a dump like that.

04:48.747 --> 04:51.749
-We'll give him to his mom.
-Come here then.

04:53.377 --> 04:55.503
-Wanna help me change his diaper?
-Yes, I do.

04:55.671 --> 04:57.546
Hey, how's the vintage car
thing going?

04:57.714 --> 05:00.508
Oh, no, no, no. l changed jobs.
I'm a pastry chef now.

05:00.676 --> 05:02.802
-You mean you're a baker.
-Yeah.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.720
You wanna get baked?

05:06.223 --> 05:08.849
I know, I know.

05:09.017 --> 05:11.060
It's hard, isn't it?

05:11.561 --> 05:15.356
Oh, no. This is so much fun.

05:15.899 --> 05:18.526
Did you know the exact moment
you wanted to have a baby?

05:18.694 --> 05:23.197
I can't remember, but l've had the box
since before l got married.

05:23.365 --> 05:24.907
What box?

05:25.075 --> 05:28.202
It's girly and embarrassing,
and you'll laugh at me if I tell you.

05:28.662 --> 05:31.664
I will laugh at you,
but you still have to tell me.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.000
Come on.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.168
Under the bed.

05:42.551 --> 05:45.261
I've been filling it with baby things...

05:45.429 --> 05:48.264
...waiting until Andy
was ready to be a father.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.227
So sweet.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.062
Does this come in my size?

06:01.111 --> 06:04.613
I have a box just like this, except
it's filled with National Geographics...

06:04.781 --> 06:06.949
...and The Times travel section.

06:07.117 --> 06:10.244
All the places l wanna see
before l die.

06:10.412 --> 06:14.874
Liz, having a baby is like
getting a tattoo on your face.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.461
You kind of wanna be
fully committed.

06:22.424 --> 06:25.801
So my trip to Aruba next week,
which is just a basic, you know...

06:25.969 --> 06:28.596
..."where to sleep, swim
and stuff your face" piece....

06:28.764 --> 06:30.222
I got a new bikini.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.893
And it turns out,
I have unlimited minibar access.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.895
-You know what that means?
-Jet lag?

06:36.063 --> 06:38.773
You, me...

06:38.940 --> 06:40.316
...macadamia nuts.

06:41.860 --> 06:42.943
That was cute.

06:43.111 --> 06:46.322
You know who l was talking to
at the party who was really inspiring...

06:46.490 --> 06:47.865
-...was Tara's friend.
-Brian.

06:48.033 --> 06:51.202
Brian. Unbelievable.
He's a teacher, you know that?

06:51.369 --> 06:53.120
He's a substitute teacher, isn't he?

06:53.288 --> 06:56.332
Yeah. He was talking about the
budget cuts that are happening now.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.250
There's no money for anything.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.087
There's no music classes,
there's no arts classes.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.215
They're volunteering their time
to do all of this after school.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.425
They're educating our kids,
you know?

07:06.593 --> 07:09.470
I think you'd make
a great teacher, honey.

07:09.638 --> 07:12.848
Thank you,
but I was thinking more of like...

07:13.433 --> 07:16.769
...education. Getting my masters,
going back to school. l don't know.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.604
You know?

07:25.362 --> 07:27.488
I-- You know....

07:28.115 --> 07:30.699
-Going back to school.
-l'm just thinking out loud.

07:33.245 --> 07:38.290
I was getting the sinking feeling that
Ketut's prophecy was coming true.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.127
Was l in the shorter marriage?

07:42.879 --> 07:45.881
We'd only bought this house
a year ago.

07:46.550 --> 07:47.967
Hadn't I wanted this?

07:50.428 --> 07:54.723
I had actively participated
in every moment of the creation...

07:54.891 --> 07:56.725
...of this life.

07:56.893 --> 08:00.229
So why didn't I see myself
in any of it?

08:05.652 --> 08:09.572
The only thing more impossible
than staying...

08:09.739 --> 08:11.615
...was leaving.

08:13.243 --> 08:17.413
I didn't wanna hurt anybody. l wanted
to slip quietly out the back door...

08:17.581 --> 08:21.083
...and not stop running
until l reached Greenland.

08:25.547 --> 08:28.090
lnstead, l made a decision.

08:28.717 --> 08:30.426
To pray.

08:30.677 --> 08:34.096
You know, like, to God.

08:34.806 --> 08:39.351
And it was such a foreign concept to
me, that l swear l almost began with:

08:39.519 --> 08:41.520
"l'm a big fan of your work."

08:48.737 --> 08:50.821
Hello, God?

08:53.700 --> 08:56.785
Nice to finally meet you. l....

08:57.704 --> 09:03.959
I am sorry l've never spoken
directly to you before...

09:04.127 --> 09:05.794
...but...

09:06.630 --> 09:09.465
...l hope l've expressed my...

09:10.133 --> 09:14.178
...ample gratitude for all
the blessings you've given...

09:14.346 --> 09:16.639
...to me in my life.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.984
I'm in serious trouble.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.322
I don't know what to do.

09:34.658 --> 09:37.159
I need an answer.

09:37.661 --> 09:41.872
Please, tell me what to do.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.335
Oh, God, help me, please.

09:52.509 --> 09:55.469
Tell me what to do and l'll do it.

09:58.306 --> 10:01.016
Go back to bed, Liz.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.373
I don't wanna go to Aruba.

10:28.003 --> 10:30.629
I don't wanna be married.

10:47.939 --> 10:50.733
You know, there's a whole
divorce section downstairs.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.086
-"Pepper grinder."
-She's having...

11:11.254 --> 11:13.464
-...a nervous breakdown.
-This is what girls do.

11:13.631 --> 11:16.133
-She's processing.
-Why doesn't she get drunk or laid?

11:16.301 --> 11:18.302
That's what l would do if you left me.

11:18.470 --> 11:19.845
No, you wouldn't.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.723
-No, I wouldn't.
-She moved out, she filed for divorce.

11:22.891 --> 11:26.185
They were together eight years.
She's got no home.

11:33.276 --> 11:35.194
"Legacy."

11:37.781 --> 11:42.618
Every word in Italian is like a truffle.
A magic trick.

11:43.119 --> 11:46.163
Honey, l get it.
It's your life raft right now.

11:46.331 --> 11:49.583
When Andy and l broke up
for two weeks, l bought a loom.

11:49.751 --> 11:52.586
A frigging loom.
And he tried to start a microbrewery.

11:52.754 --> 11:55.714
I don't know how you guys
aren't sick of me now. I'm sick of me.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.133
Are you kidding me?
We love having you.

11:58.301 --> 12:00.427
It's kind of like having
a writer in residence.

12:00.595 --> 12:03.097
But you are a writer.
You should be writing something.

12:03.264 --> 12:07.434
Maybe I could write about a woman
who goes to Italy to learn ltalian.

12:07.602 --> 12:11.063
Call it
Carbohydrates and Conjugations.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.774
I'll start looking for a place.

12:15.527 --> 12:18.237
-l'm falling in love with you.
-l'm not who you think I am.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.905
I'm just your fantasy.

12:20.073 --> 12:24.284
No, that's bullshit. You're real.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.454
Your scars, your talent.

12:27.622 --> 12:29.706
The fact that
I own a piece-of-crap bar...

12:29.874 --> 12:32.126
...and you accept that
that's all l'm gonna do.

12:32.293 --> 12:33.669
Okay, this sucks.

12:33.837 --> 12:36.338
-l second that.
-Don't be rude.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.556
I love your pain.

12:46.307 --> 12:50.269
And l love that when we're together,
I can make it go away.

12:51.354 --> 12:52.855
-Oh, he's good.
-You're love...

12:53.022 --> 12:56.692
-He's hot, there's a difference.
-...is like a hot panini.

12:56.860 --> 13:01.989
And when I look into your eyes,
I hear dolphins clapping.

13:02.157 --> 13:04.658
I did not write that line.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.326
Here's what he doesn't know yet.

13:07.579 --> 13:11.290
I disappear into the person l love.

13:11.458 --> 13:16.378
I am the permeable membrane.
If l love you, you can have it all.

13:16.546 --> 13:19.381
My money, my time, my body...

13:19.549 --> 13:23.051
...my dog, my dog's money.

13:23.219 --> 13:26.388
I will assume your debts
and project upon you...

13:26.556 --> 13:31.727
...all sorts of nifty qualities you've
never actually cultivated in yourself.

13:31.895 --> 13:34.480
I will give you all this and more...

13:34.647 --> 13:37.483
...until l am so exhausted
and depleted...

13:37.650 --> 13:40.486
...the only way l can recover...

13:40.653 --> 13:43.197
...is by becoming infatuated
with someone else.

13:50.413 --> 13:52.623
-Elizabeth, hi.
-Hi.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.416
Oh, really?

13:57.337 --> 13:59.421
How you doing?

14:30.703 --> 14:32.454
Cheers.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.583
-Thank you.
-l owe you an apology.

14:36.751 --> 14:40.629
-For the walkouts.
-Well, l'm not everyone's cup of tea.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.340
I doubt that.

14:44.092 --> 14:46.093
I, on the other hand, was shit.

14:46.886 --> 14:51.640
-Although l was trying very hard.
-"Shit" is a strong word.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.517
Thank you.

14:53.685 --> 14:56.645
You seem shorter in person
than on the stage.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.730
-Really? l hear that a lot.
-Sorry.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.440
It's okay.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.360
It's unnerving when...

15:03.528 --> 15:07.489
...a total stranger sees you
more clearly than you see yourself.

15:07.657 --> 15:09.908
That's what l mean
by saying you're short.

15:14.330 --> 15:17.583
Are you hearing dolphins clapping
right now?

15:18.918 --> 15:22.337
I took a few liberties
with your material.

15:22.505 --> 15:25.799
I give you full permission to make
fun of me. I know you're dying to.

15:27.510 --> 15:30.387
You're far too charming
to make fun of.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.019
I'm still hearing them.

15:45.987 --> 15:48.322
Is that your guru?

15:49.407 --> 15:52.284
You're joking, but, yes, it is.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.495
She's beautiful.

15:55.663 --> 15:58.332
Yeah. A friend told me about her.

15:59.208 --> 16:02.127
I was out of work and feeling
pretty desperate for something.

16:02.295 --> 16:05.130
Not the last time I was out of work,
the time before that.

16:05.298 --> 16:10.552
And l just had this feeling like
I was looking in all the wrong places.

16:10.720 --> 16:11.970
Looking for what?

16:12.305 --> 16:13.347
God.

16:14.932 --> 16:18.268
She has an ashram in India.
I'm dying to go, but...

16:18.436 --> 16:21.772
...you know, you have to get, like,
three stages of hepatitis shots...

16:21.939 --> 16:24.816
...and my insurance always runs out.

16:25.026 --> 16:26.943
I'll go when the time's right.

16:27.111 --> 16:30.280
There's a gathering of her students
every morning.

16:31.407 --> 16:34.409
If you want,
I could take you sometime.

16:34.577 --> 16:39.915
If you're not unnerved by 1 00
crunchy people chanting in Sanskrit.

16:40.750 --> 16:43.001
I need to be unnerved.

17:13.907 --> 17:17.577
David. A yogi from Yonkers.

17:19.122 --> 17:22.499
I didn't exactly fall in love
with the guy.

17:23.917 --> 17:26.586
What happened was
I dove out of my marriage...

17:26.753 --> 17:28.380
...and into David's arms...

17:28.548 --> 17:31.800
...exactly the same way
a cartoon circus performer...

17:31.968 --> 17:36.596
...dives off a high platform
and into a small cup of water...

17:37.014 --> 17:38.473
...vanishing completely.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.068
Your underwear, my queen.

17:53.656 --> 17:56.241
He just folded my delicates.

17:56.409 --> 18:00.120
Oh, my God, baby,
you are in so much trouble.

18:52.173 --> 18:53.548
Thirty-six?

19:07.230 --> 19:09.731
My client is simply not interested
in a divorce.

19:11.609 --> 19:13.777
Is he serious?

19:13.945 --> 19:15.821
Is he really representing himself?

19:15.988 --> 19:18.073
One semester of law school
right here, baby.

19:18.241 --> 19:20.992
Great. Well, what would it take
to interest your client?

19:21.577 --> 19:24.746
Okay, so here's the deal.
You have screwed up my life...

19:24.914 --> 19:27.791
...but what l wanna know
is why couldn't you find yourself...

19:27.959 --> 19:30.836
...in our marriage? Why didn't you
say what you were thinking?

19:31.003 --> 19:33.505
-l did. You never listened to me.
-No. You never said:

19:33.673 --> 19:36.424
"Hey, you know what?
You suck. l'm deeply unhappy."

19:36.592 --> 19:39.928
You just took off. You never gave me
a chance to address those problems.

19:40.096 --> 19:42.931
That's not fair. That's just quitting.
I took vows.

19:43.099 --> 19:46.017
Till death.
And l take them seriously.

19:46.519 --> 19:49.396
I believe this is just a phase
and l'm willing to wait it out.

19:49.564 --> 19:51.022
You are always waiting, Stephen.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.441
Waiting for me to come home,
to wanna have kids...

19:53.609 --> 19:56.278
...to make you dinner.
I don't know why we can't accept...

19:56.445 --> 19:58.613
...we don't wanna live
in unhappiness anymore.

19:58.781 --> 20:01.283
I accept the fact that
I am occasionally unreliable...

20:01.450 --> 20:04.703
...and l often get sidetracked,
but I thought you liked that about me.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.205
I thought it was okay
that I had hopes and dreams.

20:07.373 --> 20:10.959
Have a dream. Stephen, great,
fine. Do that. Just pick one.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.128
Okay, l pick one. I pick you.

20:22.930 --> 20:25.348
I know this is awful.

20:26.726 --> 20:31.396
But l believe with every molecule of
my body that you will find the person...

20:31.564 --> 20:34.149
...that wants just what you want.

20:34.317 --> 20:37.652
That will give you what you want
and what you deserve. l'm not her.

20:38.070 --> 20:42.157
Well, you obviously know nothing
about what l want.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.495
My client would like to submit
a song he wrote...

20:47.663 --> 20:52.000
...that he believes is relevant to these
proceedings. Goes something like this:

20:53.002 --> 20:54.628
Are you kidding?

20:58.841 --> 21:01.134
Quitter, quitter, quitter!

21:01.302 --> 21:04.262
How about l take the blame?
I am the one who couldn't deal...

21:04.430 --> 21:07.432
...with another weekend roaming
some box-shaped superstore...

21:07.600 --> 21:09.142
...buying appliances on credit...

21:09.310 --> 21:13.480
...and pretending to be a couple that
neither one of us ever knew how to be.

21:13.648 --> 21:15.023
You wanted that toaster.

21:15.191 --> 21:20.528
"You like faking it, fine. You're stellar.
I'm the failure. l suck at faking it."

21:20.863 --> 21:23.698
-lt was not my finest hour.
-So where do things stand now?

21:23.866 --> 21:26.284
We're prepared
to offer half of everything...

21:26.452 --> 21:29.496
...and my client's retirement accounts.

21:30.665 --> 21:32.874
Take it all then. Everything.

21:33.042 --> 21:35.377
He still said no.

21:35.878 --> 21:38.672
-He hates me now.
-He doesn't hate you.

21:38.839 --> 21:41.216
His heart is broken.

21:44.387 --> 21:45.887
I think he hates you.

21:46.055 --> 21:48.014
I'm never letting you
out of the basement.

21:48.182 --> 21:51.434
Why don't we talk next week
and we'll see where things stand?

21:51.602 --> 21:53.186
-Okay.
-These things have a way...

21:53.354 --> 21:54.980
...of working themselves out.

22:10.079 --> 22:11.830
So why'd you become a vegetarian?

22:11.998 --> 22:14.249
I saw some cows slaughtered
one time.

22:14.417 --> 22:16.251
Barely touched your dinner.

22:16.419 --> 22:18.753
He's 28.

22:21.590 --> 22:24.676
This is hard for him, isn't it?
And you?

22:24.844 --> 22:27.178
The meditations help.

22:28.472 --> 22:29.764
Liz.

22:30.141 --> 22:33.226
You remember a couple of years ago,
when you threw yourself into...

22:33.394 --> 22:36.062
...the renovation of your kitchen?
You were consumed...

22:36.230 --> 22:38.148
...with being the perfect wife and cook.

22:38.315 --> 22:39.733
I was trying to make it work.

22:39.900 --> 22:42.777
Well, l think chanting and meditation
is the same thing...

22:42.945 --> 22:44.612
...in a different costume.

22:48.242 --> 22:49.951
Definitely give me that documentary.

22:50.119 --> 22:52.078
I've been thinking
about vegetarianism.

22:52.246 --> 22:54.205
My triglycerides
are through the roof.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.707
Yeah. Thanks for everything.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.917
Great to meet you.

23:02.298 --> 23:06.176
-What?
-Nothing. lt's just...

23:06.343 --> 23:08.303
...you know,
you used to look like Stephen.

23:08.471 --> 23:10.805
Now you kind of look like David.

23:10.973 --> 23:12.599
You know?

23:13.392 --> 23:18.146
What l meant was, you know how
people start resembling their dogs?

23:20.649 --> 23:23.109
Why would he say that,
we look like the same dog?

23:23.277 --> 23:24.819
-He was joking.
-Not funny.

23:24.987 --> 23:27.530
Well, he had five Heinekens.
He was bombed.

23:27.698 --> 23:29.908
Well, not funny.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.535
We don't look like the same dog.

23:33.329 --> 23:38.792
If anything, you're a collie
and l'm a Tibetan mastiff.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.971
Don't you wanna give me a chance
to miss you?

24:13.202 --> 24:15.829
It begins when
the object of your affection...

24:15.996 --> 24:19.541
...bestows upon you
a heady hallucinogenic dose...

24:19.708 --> 24:22.710
...of something you've never
even dared to admit you wanted...

24:22.878 --> 24:26.798
...an emotional speedball
of thunderous love and excitement.

24:26.966 --> 24:30.260
Soon you start craving that attention
with the hungry obsession...

24:30.427 --> 24:32.053
...of any junkie.

24:32.221 --> 24:35.723
When it's withheld, you turn sick,
crazy, not to mention resentful...

24:35.891 --> 24:39.060
...of the dealer who encouraged
this addiction in the first place...

24:39.228 --> 24:41.604
...but now refuses to pony up
the good stuff.

24:41.772 --> 24:44.732
Just frustrated, l'm concerned.
I don't understand.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.401
What don't you get?

24:46.569 --> 24:48.653
What's going on?
You don't look me in the eye.

24:48.821 --> 24:51.197
-You don't finish your--
-Nobody's asking you to make the bed!

24:51.365 --> 24:54.117
-You don't have sex with me!
-Sometimes I'm not in the mood!

24:54.285 --> 24:56.911
Goddamn him, and he used to
give it to you for free.

24:57.079 --> 25:00.081
Next stage finds you skinny,
shaking in a corner...

25:00.249 --> 25:02.250
...certain only that
you'd sell your soul...

25:02.418 --> 25:04.502
...just to have that one thing
one more time.

25:04.670 --> 25:07.297
Well, then why don't we discuss it?
Why don't we sort it?

25:07.464 --> 25:10.800
-Why don't we act like adults?
-Okay. Can I have a little space?

25:10.968 --> 25:12.594
-How about that?
-Meanwhile...

25:12.761 --> 25:16.180
...the object of your adoration
is now repulsed by you.

25:16.348 --> 25:19.225
-You don't always make me miserable.
-There's a comfort.

25:19.393 --> 25:22.854
I just-- Sometimes l need to
come home...

25:23.522 --> 25:25.273
...and have a little David time.

25:25.441 --> 25:28.776
He looks at you like someone
he's never met before.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.695
-ls that okay?
-Yeah. No, it's fine.

25:30.863 --> 25:33.948
And not have to, like, you know,
justify it.

25:34.116 --> 25:37.243
The irony is
you can hardly blame him.

25:37.411 --> 25:40.788
I mean, check yourself out.
You're a mess.

25:40.956 --> 25:43.458
Unrecognizable
even to your own eyes.

25:43.626 --> 25:45.627
You asked me to come here?
Here l am.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.629
And it turned into something else.

25:47.796 --> 25:50.256
-Didn't it?
-You are such a child.

25:54.428 --> 25:57.805
-Right. I can't take this anymore.
-Great. Perfect.

25:57.973 --> 26:01.309
That's a great response
to a conversation.

26:01.477 --> 26:02.518
Goddamn it.

26:02.686 --> 26:07.607
You have now reached
infatuation's final destination.

26:08.484 --> 26:14.447
The complete
and merciless devaluation of self.

26:48.649 --> 26:50.024
You wanna go away for a year?

26:50.192 --> 26:52.318
Do you know what I felt
when l woke up, Delia?

26:52.486 --> 26:57.073
Nothing. No passion, no spark,
no faith, no heat. Absolutely nothing.

26:57.241 --> 27:00.451
I've gotten past the point where
I can be calling this a bad moment.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.955
And it just terrifies me. Jesus,
this is like worse than death to me...

27:04.123 --> 27:06.958
...the idea that this is the person
I'm gonna be from now on.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.418
This happens to people.

27:08.585 --> 27:10.670
They fall in love in their 20s,
get married...

27:10.838 --> 27:13.798
...do the granite countertop,
white-picket fence in their 30s...

27:13.966 --> 27:16.342
...and somewhere they realize,
"This is not for me."

27:16.510 --> 27:20.013
So they fail and they fall down,
they hurt like hell, they straighten up...

27:20.180 --> 27:22.432
...and march their asses
to the shrink's office.

27:22.599 --> 27:26.102
-They can't just check out.
-l am not checking out.

27:26.270 --> 27:27.770
I need to change.

27:27.938 --> 27:30.189
You have a support system
here, Liz.

27:30.357 --> 27:32.191
You have friends and family
who love you.

27:32.359 --> 27:36.029
And do you feel my love for you?
My support for you? No.

27:36.196 --> 27:38.698
There's, like, nothing. l have no pulse.

27:41.243 --> 27:43.661
-l am going to Italy.
-ltaly. Why ltaly?

27:43.829 --> 27:46.289
-What did you have for lunch?
-l don't know. A salad.

27:46.457 --> 27:51.669
Exactly. l used to have this appetite
for food, for my life...

27:51.837 --> 27:52.962
...and it is just gone.

27:54.548 --> 27:58.843
I wanna go someplace
where l can marvel at something.

27:59.011 --> 28:02.430
Language, gelato,
spaghetti, something.

28:02.598 --> 28:05.516
-You're talking like a college kid.
-l've been acting like one.

28:05.684 --> 28:09.228
Since I was 1 5, I've either been
with a guy or breaking up with a guy.

28:09.396 --> 28:12.356
I have not given myself
two weeks of a breather...

28:12.524 --> 28:15.818
...to just deal with, you know, myself.

28:18.155 --> 28:20.031
What's going on
with you and David?

28:28.665 --> 28:29.749
What, did you fall out?

28:30.084 --> 28:32.126
I don't know how to be here.

28:32.294 --> 28:35.922
You wanna know how to be here?
Stop constantly waiting for something.

28:40.594 --> 28:45.306
I'm going to Italy and then l'm going
to David's guru's ashram in lndia...

28:45.474 --> 28:48.893
...and l'm going to end the year
in Bali.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.439
That's what l'm gonna do.

28:53.607 --> 28:56.275
That's harder to argue with.
The beaches are nice. But why?

28:56.443 --> 28:58.444
-Ketut told me I would.
-Guy with no teeth.

28:58.612 --> 28:59.695
When you're desperate...

28:59.863 --> 29:02.365
...and some guy who,
yes, looks a little like Yoda...

29:02.533 --> 29:05.785
...hands you a prophecy,
you have to respond.

29:05.953 --> 29:08.121
-Do you need a Xanax?
-Always.

29:09.123 --> 29:12.458
Okay, l'm just gonna say it.
I'm gonna say it and be done with it.

29:12.626 --> 29:13.709
What if it doesn't work?

29:18.215 --> 29:21.050
My whole life
fits in a 1 2-foot-square box.

29:22.803 --> 29:25.471
You know how many times
I hear that in a day?

29:25.639 --> 29:27.932
Most of them never come back
for their whole life.

29:32.813 --> 29:33.980
-Hello?
-Liz.

29:34.148 --> 29:37.108
Good news. Stephen just signed
the divorce papers.

29:45.826 --> 29:50.037
I'll probably be back in a week,
penniless with dysentery.

29:50.205 --> 29:52.081
You're my hero.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.180
Hey.

30:08.765 --> 30:11.309
If you stay,
we'll go out for lndian every night.

30:13.395 --> 30:15.271
You never asked me to stay.

30:21.570 --> 30:23.446
Go, go, go.

30:43.550 --> 30:45.176
You know what's funny?

30:45.344 --> 30:48.971
This is the first time in my life
there's no one waiting at home for me.

30:49.139 --> 30:51.015
I don't even have a home
to come back to.

30:51.183 --> 30:52.516
Oh, God. You'll make friends.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.810
You'll make friends with a backpack,
of course.

30:54.978 --> 30:56.437
It'd be great to get away.

30:56.605 --> 31:00.775
Andy and l were talking about getting
a little villa in Florence for a month.

31:00.943 --> 31:03.611
You know, and in 1 0 years,
when Jack is older....

31:04.613 --> 31:05.947
What?

31:08.033 --> 31:10.952
You know why l was giving you
such a hard time?

31:12.204 --> 31:15.706
I love my job, my guy and my kid,
but....

31:17.626 --> 31:19.627
I wish I could go.

31:28.804 --> 31:30.304
I love you and l'm proud of you.

31:31.306 --> 31:32.848
Now go.

31:56.456 --> 31:58.332
There is a wonderful
old Italian joke...

31:58.500 --> 32:00.835
...about a poor man
who goes to church every day...

32:01.003 --> 32:05.339
...and prays before the statue
of a great saint, begging:

32:06.133 --> 32:12.138
"Dear saint, please, please, please
let me win the lottery."

32:12.973 --> 32:15.766
Finally, the exasperated statue
comes to life...

32:15.934 --> 32:18.144
...and looks down at the begging man
and says:

32:18.353 --> 32:23.733
"My son, please, please, please
buy a ticket."

32:24.568 --> 32:26.360
So now l get the joke.

32:26.528 --> 32:29.155
And l've got three tickets.

32:49.634 --> 32:52.678
You heat the water on the stove.

32:54.598 --> 32:56.891
So if I want to bathe...?

32:57.059 --> 33:02.063
You put the water in the tub.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.400
Okay.

33:06.735 --> 33:13.157
Yeah. lt doesn't really seem like
enough water to bathe in.

33:15.243 --> 33:17.745
Not enough.

33:17.913 --> 33:19.663
Yes, it's enough.

33:19.831 --> 33:23.209
Fill it up three, four, five times.

33:23.710 --> 33:26.921
Everything that's important
gets cleaned.

33:43.146 --> 33:45.606
Is this safe? This...

33:46.858 --> 33:49.110
...scaffolding? Scaffol--

33:49.277 --> 33:51.278
It holds up the ceiling.

33:51.446 --> 33:54.657
Otherwise it will fall apart.

33:55.325 --> 33:56.951
Everything falls apart, my dear.

33:57.119 --> 34:01.789
The only thing permanent in life
is family.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.086
You're not married.

34:08.255 --> 34:10.214
No, divorziata.

34:10.632 --> 34:12.257
Why divorced?

34:16.179 --> 34:17.596
We broke it.

34:20.641 --> 34:23.143
You're more happy now?

34:27.524 --> 34:29.108
I have one rule.

34:29.650 --> 34:34.822
No strange men spending the night.

34:34.989 --> 34:37.699
You American girls
when you come to ltaly...

34:37.868 --> 34:40.202
...all you want is pasta...

34:40.370 --> 34:42.413
...and sausage.

34:47.252 --> 34:48.335
I'll take it.

34:48.670 --> 34:49.962
Good. You chose well.

35:24.164 --> 35:25.206
Cappuccino.

35:25.373 --> 35:28.542
-lt's a zoo in here.
-And my ltalian sucks.

35:28.710 --> 35:31.212
-How long have you been here?
-Two weeks. You?

35:31.379 --> 35:33.297
Six weeks. You'll get better.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.216
Two cappuccinos, please.

35:35.383 --> 35:37.092
And warm the milk this time.

35:37.260 --> 35:39.303
Yesterday it was too hot
and burned my tongue.

35:39.930 --> 35:41.764
-You like Napoleons?
-Of course.

35:41.932 --> 35:44.308
And two Napoleons, please.

35:45.060 --> 35:47.144
Your Italian is fantastic.

35:47.312 --> 35:50.689
I have a wonderful tutor.
I'll give you his number if you like.

35:50.857 --> 35:53.442
-He's really good and he needs work.
-Oh, great.

35:53.610 --> 35:55.527
Are you Dutch? German?

35:55.695 --> 35:59.323
Swedish. Even colder people,
if you can imagine.

35:59.991 --> 36:02.868
-l'm Liz, by the way.
-Sofi.

37:28.621 --> 37:29.663
You can say:

37:34.794 --> 37:35.919
It's past.

37:47.682 --> 37:49.016
Too fast, but okay.

37:49.184 --> 37:50.309
You can say:

37:53.146 --> 37:54.521
Yeah.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.198
What a beautiful word.

38:04.366 --> 38:07.701
Come on, it's "let's cross over."
It's so ordinary.

38:08.536 --> 38:12.873
No, it's the perfect combination
of ltalian sounds.

38:13.041 --> 38:17.211
It's the wistful "ah," the rolling trill,
the soothing "ess."

38:17.545 --> 38:19.380
-That's true.
-l love it.

38:19.756 --> 38:22.091
All right, let me teach you a word.

38:26.679 --> 38:32.017
Therapist.

38:32.185 --> 38:33.977
-Come on.
-Good. You gotta learn humor.

38:34.145 --> 38:35.646
-lt's not.
-Come on. Cheers.

38:44.072 --> 38:46.240
-Shall we continue Tuesday at 5?
-Yes.

38:46.408 --> 38:49.576
-With another bottle of the therapy?
-Of course.

38:49.744 --> 38:52.121
-You're doing very well, Liz.
-Thank you.

38:52.288 --> 38:54.456
And you must be very polite
with yourself...

38:54.624 --> 38:56.125
...when you learn something new.

38:56.292 --> 38:58.085
Yes. Grazie, I agree.

38:58.253 --> 39:01.797
But your English-- How are you
even talking to me like this right now?

39:01.965 --> 39:04.508
I think you're gonna teach me
more than I teach you.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.593
You have good Italian. Very good.

39:06.928 --> 39:08.220
All right.

39:52.307 --> 39:54.808
I am alone.

41:53.761 --> 41:56.263
I feel so guilty.
I've been in Rome for three weeks...

41:56.431 --> 41:58.932
...all l've done is learn
a few ltalian words and eat.

41:59.100 --> 42:00.934
You feel guilty
because you're American.

42:01.102 --> 42:02.978
You don't know
how to enjoy yourself.

42:03.146 --> 42:05.355
-l beg your pardon?
-lt's true.

42:05.523 --> 42:08.775
Americans know entertainment,
but don't know pleasure.

42:09.444 --> 42:12.195
This is Luca Spaghetti, by the way,
you know.

42:12.780 --> 42:14.906
Your name is Luca Spaghetti?

42:15.074 --> 42:16.950
Yes, that's what our family is called.

42:17.118 --> 42:19.953
We invented it.
I'm serious. Listen to me.

42:20.121 --> 42:22.497
You want to know your problem?
Americans.

42:22.832 --> 42:25.083
You work too hard.
You get burned out.

42:25.251 --> 42:27.919
Then you come home
and spend the whole weekend...

42:28.087 --> 42:30.714
...in your pajamas in front of the TV.

42:30.882 --> 42:32.633
That's not far off, actually.

42:32.800 --> 42:36.970
But you don't know pleasure.
You have to be told you've earned it.

42:37.138 --> 42:40.057
You see a commercial that says,
"It's Miller time"...

42:40.224 --> 42:44.311
...and you say, "That's right.
Now I will go to buy a six-pack."

42:44.479 --> 42:49.316
And drink the whole thing and wake up
the next morning and you feel terrible.

42:49.484 --> 42:52.319
But an ltalian doesn't need
to be told.

42:52.487 --> 42:56.698
He walks by a sign that says,
"you deserve a break today"...

42:56.866 --> 42:58.325
...and he says, "Yeah, l know.

42:58.493 --> 43:02.329
That's why I'm planning on
taking a break at noon...

43:02.497 --> 43:05.749
...to go over to your house
and sleep with your wife."

43:07.335 --> 43:09.836
We call it "dolce far niente."

43:10.004 --> 43:11.421
It means...

43:11.756 --> 43:15.509
...the sweetness of doing nothing.
We are masters of it.

43:28.314 --> 43:30.232
He's right. He says...

43:30.400 --> 43:32.150
...you can't learn ltalian like this.

43:32.318 --> 43:36.738
You don't speak the language just with
your mouth, speak it with your hands.

43:36.906 --> 43:37.948
Like this?

43:41.536 --> 43:44.204
Okay. ls yelling.

43:48.209 --> 43:49.459
'THAT MEAL WAS EXCELLENT'

43:59.679 --> 44:01.054
'SUCK IT'

44:03.224 --> 44:05.016
All this gives me a stomachache.

44:06.185 --> 44:07.436
'SCREW YOU'

44:08.312 --> 44:11.231
-l think that's my neighbor Lorenzo.
-Charming.

44:14.736 --> 44:17.195
ANOTHER WAY
TO SAY 'SCREW YOU'

44:28.124 --> 44:30.542
So anyway, to start off l'd say....

44:30.710 --> 44:32.377
Excuse me.

44:32.920 --> 44:33.962
Come here.

44:36.632 --> 44:37.674
For the table...

44:37.842 --> 44:40.927
...a big platter
of artichoke alla giudia...

44:41.262 --> 44:42.596
...prosciutto with melon...

44:42.764 --> 44:45.140
...and eggplant
with ricotta affumicata.

44:46.058 --> 44:48.018
Then spaghetti alla carbonara...

44:48.686 --> 44:50.771
...pappardelle with ragu of rabbit...

44:50.938 --> 44:52.898
...and linguini with clams.

44:53.065 --> 44:55.275
Then tripe alla romana...

44:55.443 --> 44:56.443
...and saltimbocca.

44:56.611 --> 44:59.613
And two more liters
of the vino sfuso from Genzano.

44:59.781 --> 45:01.072
Thank you.

45:03.493 --> 45:06.286
You did it. Yes.

45:06.454 --> 45:08.455
Liz Gilbert,
you are a Roman woman now.

45:08.623 --> 45:10.916
No, only honorary.

45:11.083 --> 45:13.043
That is a real Roman woman.

45:16.589 --> 45:19.424
Yeah, with a lot
of international friends.

45:19.592 --> 45:21.134
That one, I'd bite.

45:22.637 --> 45:24.846
Maybe you and Rome
just have different words.

45:25.014 --> 45:26.640
-Different words?
-Yeah.

45:26.808 --> 45:30.477
Yeah. lt's like each city has a word,
if you really think about it.

45:30.645 --> 45:33.480
Like, what is the word for London?

45:33.648 --> 45:36.107
-l would say "stuffy."
-l would agree with that.

45:36.484 --> 45:39.653
-What's the word for Stockholm?
-Are you kidding? "Conform."

45:39.821 --> 45:41.112
And New York?

45:41.280 --> 45:44.658
"Ambition" or "soot."

45:44.992 --> 45:47.160
What's the word for Rome?

45:47.578 --> 45:49.412
It's kind of difficult to think about.

45:49.580 --> 45:50.789
It's classic.

45:50.957 --> 45:52.457
"Sex."

45:55.044 --> 45:56.670
Of course.

46:23.030 --> 46:26.700
So, what's your word, Liz?
I'm curious. l can't figure it out.

46:26.868 --> 46:28.535
Well....

46:31.247 --> 46:33.373
It might be....

46:34.166 --> 46:39.045
It started as "daughter."
I was good at that. And then...

46:39.505 --> 46:42.382
..."wife." Not so good.

46:42.550 --> 46:44.384
"Girlfriend."

46:45.386 --> 46:47.053
Not so good.

46:47.221 --> 46:48.680
My word's "writer."

46:48.848 --> 46:52.350
Yeah, but that's what you do.
That isn't who you are, no?

46:52.852 --> 46:55.020
Maybe you're a woman
in search of her word.

47:08.284 --> 47:12.579
Hey, Sofi, it's Liz. Let's go to Naples.
Maybe my word is "pizza."

47:27.094 --> 47:30.680
Listen, lady, I am only 7, but l
can tell you're a complete moron...

47:30.848 --> 47:33.183
...because I am from Naples.

47:33.768 --> 47:36.061
I love this place,
but Giovanni said to watch out.

47:36.228 --> 47:38.772
His cousin got mugged here
in a museum.

47:38.940 --> 47:41.441
-Are you serious?
-Watch out for the scooter. Yeah.

47:55.289 --> 47:58.959
I'm in love. l'm having
a relationship with my pizza.

47:59.335 --> 48:02.420
You look like you're breaking up
with the pizza. What's the matter?

48:02.588 --> 48:03.797
I can't.

48:03.965 --> 48:06.424
What do you mean, you can't?
This is pizza in Napoli.

48:06.592 --> 48:08.760
It is your moral imperative
to eat that pizza.

48:09.136 --> 48:13.264
I want to,
but I've gained, like, 1 0 pounds.

48:13.432 --> 48:15.433
I mean, l've got this....

48:15.601 --> 48:17.811
Right here. What's it called?
What's the word?

48:18.104 --> 48:20.313
A muffin top.

48:21.148 --> 48:22.816
I have one too.

48:22.984 --> 48:25.735
I unbuttoned my jeans
five minutes ago just looking at this.

48:25.903 --> 48:27.195
Let me ask you a question.

48:27.363 --> 48:30.448
In all the years you've ever
undressed in front of a gentleman....

48:30.950 --> 48:34.285
-Hasn't been that many.
-All right, well...

48:34.704 --> 48:36.329
...has he ever asked you to leave?

48:36.497 --> 48:39.290
-Has he ever walked out? Left?
-No.

48:39.667 --> 48:41.126
Because he doesn't care.

48:41.293 --> 48:44.004
He's in a room with a naked girl.
He's won the lottery.

48:44.171 --> 48:48.008
I'm so tired of saying no
and then waking up in the morning...

48:48.175 --> 48:51.136
...and recalling every single thing
I ate the day before.

48:51.303 --> 48:53.346
Counting every calorie
so l know exactly...

48:53.514 --> 48:56.474
...how much self-loathing
to take into the shower.

48:56.851 --> 48:58.518
I'm going for it.

48:58.686 --> 49:02.022
I have no interest in being obese.
I'm just through with the guilt.

49:02.356 --> 49:04.983
This is what l'm gonna do.
I'm gonna finish this pizza...

49:05.151 --> 49:07.986
...and then we're gonna go
watch the soccer game.

49:08.154 --> 49:10.572
And tomorrow we're gonna go
on a little date...

49:10.740 --> 49:14.159
...and buy ourselves
some bigger jeans.

49:15.369 --> 49:17.829
Giovanni likes a muffin.

49:21.042 --> 49:22.208
Attagirl.

49:36.557 --> 49:38.892
He's saying,
"For whom are you playing?"

49:39.060 --> 49:40.310
Per chi, for whom.

49:47.026 --> 49:50.111
Pull, pull. l'm sucking it in.

49:51.864 --> 49:53.531
Put some Swedish muscle into this.

49:57.912 --> 49:59.913
You think this happened
to Sophia Loren?

50:00.081 --> 50:01.539
There it goes. Almost got it.

50:03.417 --> 50:05.418
Go, go, go. You're not trying.

50:07.379 --> 50:10.048
I've almost got it. l've almost got it.
I did it.

50:33.280 --> 50:36.074
Oh, that's beautiful.
You should get it.

50:37.701 --> 50:39.369
For whom?

50:39.829 --> 50:42.622
For you, Liz. Just for you.

50:45.876 --> 50:48.962
No, I'm happy just
with my big lady pants.

51:06.397 --> 51:08.398
Thanks for the day.
And the leg room.

51:10.025 --> 51:11.317
It was fun.

51:13.320 --> 51:15.113
We're gonna go for food.
Wanna come?

51:15.281 --> 51:17.824
No. No, l'm good.

52:19.136 --> 52:21.679
The sweetness of doing nothing.

52:34.985 --> 52:36.736
Please. Please get off the floor.

52:44.161 --> 52:48.039
Will you please just...?
Will you come up here?

52:57.883 --> 53:02.512
What if we just acknowledge that
we have a screwed-up relationship...

53:02.680 --> 53:05.556
...and we stick it out anyway?

53:06.725 --> 53:10.103
We accept that we fight a lot...

53:10.271 --> 53:13.106
...and we hardly have sex anymore...

53:13.274 --> 53:17.026
...but that we don't wanna
live without each other.

53:17.486 --> 53:20.655
And that way we can spend
our lives together...

53:20.823 --> 53:22.865
...miserable...

53:23.993 --> 53:26.953
...but happy not to be apart.

53:34.962 --> 53:36.713
Dear David:

53:36.880 --> 53:38.965
We haven't had any communication
in a while...

53:39.133 --> 53:42.135
...and it's given me time
I needed to think.

53:42.594 --> 53:45.888
Remember when you said we should
live with each other and be unhappy...

53:46.056 --> 53:47.390
...so we could be happy?

53:47.558 --> 53:49.809
Consider it a testimony
to how much I love you...

53:49.977 --> 53:52.645
...that I spent so long
pouring myself into that offer...

53:52.813 --> 53:54.981
...trying to make it work.

53:55.357 --> 53:58.318
But a friend took me to the most
amazing place the other day.

53:58.485 --> 53:59.986
It's called the Augusteum.

54:00.487 --> 54:03.906
Octavian Augustus built it
to house his remains.

54:04.074 --> 54:07.493
When the barbarians came, they
trashed it along with everything else.

54:07.661 --> 54:11.164
The great Augustus,
Rome's first true great emperor...

54:11.373 --> 54:13.291
...how could he have imagined
that Rome...

54:13.459 --> 54:17.003
...the whole world, as far as he was
concerned, would be in ruins?

54:17.171 --> 54:20.923
During the Dark Ages, someone came
in here and stole the emperor's ashes.

54:21.091 --> 54:23.593
In the 12th century,
it became a fortress...

54:23.761 --> 54:25.136
...then a bullring.

54:25.304 --> 54:27.305
They stored fireworks in here
after that.

54:28.515 --> 54:30.683
Nowadays, it's a bathroom
for the homeless...

54:30.893 --> 54:33.686
...so you better watch your step
going down.

54:36.315 --> 54:40.693
It's one of the quietest
and loneliest places in Rome.

54:40.861 --> 54:44.322
The city has grown up
around it over centuries.

54:44.490 --> 54:46.491
It feels like a precious wound...

54:46.658 --> 54:50.370
...like a heartbreak you won't let go of
because it hurts too good.

54:50.537 --> 54:52.705
I like it messy.

54:53.290 --> 54:56.042
We all want things
to stay the same, David.

54:56.210 --> 54:58.878
I guess the guy before me
must've been some angel, huh?

54:59.046 --> 55:00.421
Settle for living in misery...

55:00.589 --> 55:03.674
...because we're afraid of change,
of things crumbling to ruins.

55:03.842 --> 55:08.388
Then I looked around in this place,
at the chaos it's endured...

55:08.555 --> 55:11.391
...the way it's been adapted,
burned, pillaged...

55:11.558 --> 55:15.812
...then found a way to build itself
back up again, and I was reassured.

55:15.979 --> 55:19.232
Maybe my life hasn't been so chaotic.
It's just the world that is...

55:19.400 --> 55:23.027
...and the only real trap
is getting attached to any of it.

55:24.238 --> 55:26.239
Ruin is a gift.

55:26.448 --> 55:29.575
Ruin is the road to transformation.

55:29.743 --> 55:31.411
Hey.

55:32.037 --> 55:33.579
You ready?

55:34.665 --> 55:36.332
Yeah.

55:43.215 --> 55:46.217
Even in this eternal city,
the Augusteum showed me...

55:46.385 --> 55:50.763
...that we must always be prepared
for endless waves of transformation.

55:55.269 --> 55:57.520
Both of us deserve better
than staying together...

55:57.688 --> 56:00.898
...because we're afraid
we'll be destroyed if we don't.

56:58.540 --> 57:01.709
My mother's stuffing.
Stale bread, walnuts, got those.

57:01.877 --> 57:04.128
Will you get me
some more potatoes?

57:04.296 --> 57:06.339
Oh, l'm always getting you
more potatoes.

57:06.757 --> 57:09.800
It's my dream,
a real American Thanksgiving.

57:10.802 --> 57:13.179
The perfect way to say goodbye
to our Liz.

57:14.640 --> 57:16.349
So...

57:17.351 --> 57:19.560
-...you leave this week, huh?
-Yes.

57:20.437 --> 57:22.813
And where are you going? lran?

57:23.607 --> 57:24.690
India.

57:27.528 --> 57:29.445
Liz is making us
an American meal tonight.

57:29.613 --> 57:32.573
-You are not married, yeah?
-No.

57:33.659 --> 57:36.494
What's wrong with your friend,
is she a lesbian?

57:39.873 --> 57:42.542
No, Mama, she's not a lesbian.
And she understands ltalian.

57:42.709 --> 57:44.877
How's she going to find
another husband and start a family...

57:45.045 --> 57:47.713
...when she's on the other side
of the world?

57:48.173 --> 57:53.553
If a man said, "l'm going to travel for
a year and meet wonderful people...."

57:53.720 --> 57:55.221
But she's not a man.

57:55.764 --> 58:01.018
It's more difficult for a woman to feel
that she has the right to make choices.

58:01.186 --> 58:03.896
-lt takes a lot of courage.
-Exactly.

58:04.731 --> 58:07.233
You call it courage, I call it stupidity.

58:07.401 --> 58:09.193
Mama, enough.

58:10.028 --> 58:12.613
I know a number of people
who would agree with you.

58:13.740 --> 58:15.241
Luca?

58:15.409 --> 58:17.410
What time will the turkey be ready?

58:18.120 --> 58:19.704
The turkey....

58:19.913 --> 58:21.247
I haven't defrosted it yet.

58:24.668 --> 58:26.627
Oh, shit.

58:27.421 --> 58:29.422
You only had one thing to do
and you screwed it up.

58:29.590 --> 58:32.883
I was distracted! It can happen!

58:33.051 --> 58:34.885
Too much good food!

58:35.053 --> 58:36.887
Too many women!

58:37.055 --> 58:38.973
And l forgot!

58:39.141 --> 58:41.267
Now, before we eat, everyone...

58:41.435 --> 58:44.395
...it is Thanksgiving,
so let us give thanks.

58:44.563 --> 58:47.273
-Yeah. Come on, join hands.
-Okay.

58:47.441 --> 58:49.567
So we just say what we....

58:50.027 --> 58:53.654
What we thank God for tonight.
Sofi, why don't you start?

58:56.283 --> 58:59.452
I am grateful for you, Liz...

59:00.037 --> 59:03.956
...for helping me appreciate life...

59:04.374 --> 59:07.460
...with all that comes with it...

59:08.462 --> 59:11.213
...muffin tops and bad times.

59:11.673 --> 59:12.923
And for Giovanni...

59:13.592 --> 59:16.052
...for making me feel...

59:16.219 --> 59:17.803
...loved and secure.

59:20.140 --> 59:21.641
And Giulio.

59:21.808 --> 59:25.686
Me, l'm grateful for
my beautiful family.

59:25.854 --> 59:28.230
My two little daughters and my wife.

59:28.398 --> 59:32.735
I thank God and the Holy Virgin...

59:32.903 --> 59:34.904
...for this very, very special day.

59:35.238 --> 59:38.991
And for this beautiful family...

59:39.451 --> 59:40.910
...that today is so much bigger.

59:42.371 --> 59:43.496
Very much bigger.

59:48.502 --> 59:52.505
I thank you all for this new custom
of celebration.

59:52.673 --> 59:55.257
And Liz's stuffing...

59:55.842 --> 59:57.385
...and God...

59:57.552 --> 59:59.845
...for my sexiness.

01:00:03.392 --> 01:00:04.433
And you, Ruffina?

01:00:08.689 --> 01:00:11.524
I thank God for...

01:00:11.692 --> 01:00:13.526
...my sexiness.

01:00:17.739 --> 01:00:19.824
Go ahead. Giovanni.

01:00:19.991 --> 01:00:22.493
I thank God for...

01:00:24.371 --> 01:00:25.329
...fear...

01:00:25.497 --> 01:00:29.375
...because for the first time...

01:00:30.252 --> 01:00:33.087
...l'm afraid the person next to me...

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:36.173
...will be the one who wants to leave.

01:00:41.722 --> 01:00:43.431
Liz?

01:00:45.517 --> 01:00:50.187
Well, this all makes me so grateful.

01:00:51.523 --> 01:00:53.566
Seeing all you happy people...

01:00:53.734 --> 01:00:57.278
...who know how to love each other
and take care of each other.

01:00:59.156 --> 01:01:03.200
I look at the amazing women l've met
who l admire so much...

01:01:03.368 --> 01:01:08.456
...and the great men,
taking care of their women...

01:01:08.623 --> 01:01:11.459
...and putting their children to bed.

01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:15.296
I just feel happy...

01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:19.467
...to see it and to be part of it.

01:01:24.222 --> 01:01:27.308
I'm the luckiest girl in the world.

01:02:55.063 --> 01:02:57.565
It's a good breakfast, huh?

01:04:22.734 --> 01:04:24.944
I will take this to your room.

01:04:30.075 --> 01:04:31.951
It has already started.

01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:20.958
-l fell asleep.
-Yeah. Pity.

01:05:21.126 --> 01:05:25.337
Probably the only person in the world
who ever fell asleep during meditation.

01:05:32.971 --> 01:05:36.557
-This leads to the meditation garden.
-ls the guru here?

01:05:36.725 --> 01:05:40.102
-She's always here.
-l know, but is she "here" here?

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:42.354
She's at her ashram in New York.

01:05:42.522 --> 01:05:44.898
But l came from New York
to see her here.

01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:47.735
Sounds like one of her little tricks.

01:05:51.364 --> 01:05:53.741
The meditation cave.

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:58.954
It's open 24/7
and it's air-conditioned.

01:06:06.588 --> 01:06:08.464
Corella?

01:06:08.757 --> 01:06:12.468
-This is Liz Gilbert.
-Hi. Nice to meet you.

01:06:16.097 --> 01:06:19.433
-Where did you get that button?
-They sell them in the bookstore.

01:06:19.601 --> 01:06:23.187
That is exactly what I need. I need
something like that. l don't listen.

01:06:23.354 --> 01:06:26.273
I never have. My mom used to
call me Little Miss Chatty Cathy...

01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:28.358
...because I just ramble.
I am a rambler.

01:06:28.526 --> 01:06:31.403
I am rambling now. l'm sorry.

01:06:32.113 --> 01:06:34.114
Silence is a wonderful
spiritual practice...

01:06:34.282 --> 01:06:38.077
...but if Corella could speak, she'd tell
you it's more challenging than it looks.

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:41.121
-Wait till you've been here for a while.
-Okay.

01:06:53.301 --> 01:06:56.136
Thank you, Corella.
I'll be sure to tell her.

01:06:56.304 --> 01:06:58.639
-What did she say?
-No idea.

01:06:58.807 --> 01:07:01.475
Change into your work clothes.
I'll take you to your seva.

01:07:01.643 --> 01:07:04.311
It's a Hindu word
for "selfless devotional work."

01:07:04.479 --> 01:07:08.524
-lt's required of everyone who stays.
-Okay. Thank you.

01:07:35.176 --> 01:07:38.679
Is there anything in this world skinnier
than an lndian teenage boy?

01:07:41.266 --> 01:07:43.142
-l'm Tulsi.
-Liz.

01:07:43.685 --> 01:07:44.852
Where are you from?

01:07:45.019 --> 01:07:48.981
The next town. My parents have been
devotees of the guru for many years.

01:07:49.149 --> 01:07:50.524
We spend a lot of time here.

01:07:50.692 --> 01:07:52.359
But...

01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:55.946
...they are trying to marry me off.
That's the custom.

01:07:56.114 --> 01:08:00.492
-That's not what you want?
-No way. lt sucks.

01:08:05.373 --> 01:08:10.210
I want to study psychology, just as our
guru did when she attended college.

01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:13.547
I prefer to be with God
than boys my age.

01:08:13.715 --> 01:08:17.341
No one in my family understands
my coming all the way to India.

01:08:17.886 --> 01:08:21.846
Do you ever look at them and wonder,
"What am I doing in this family?"

01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:24.224
You have no idea.

01:08:51.002 --> 01:08:55.589
The Guru Gita is an ancient text
1 82 verses long.

01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:58.884
In it, the goddess Parvati
is asking Shiva, or God...

01:08:59.426 --> 01:09:01.261
...for the secrets of fulfillment.

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:05.474
It's said to have
transforming qualities.

01:09:05.934 --> 01:09:09.310
I would just like to take a risk here
and say....

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:13.689
Me and Guru Gita,
we just do not get along.

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:16.693
-What is it you have trouble with?
-Everything.

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:19.988
It's long, it's tedious,
I can't keep up...

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:24.993
...and l get these insane anxieties
about everything in my life...

01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:26.912
...and l've lost my place.

01:09:27.121 --> 01:09:28.997
Sounds like it has a positive effect...

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:32.584
...if you're having such strong
emotions and physical reactions.

01:09:34.002 --> 01:09:35.879
You keep trying.

01:09:43.805 --> 01:09:46.180
It is most commendable
that you ended your marriage.

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:49.267
You seem like such a
happy, free person now.

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:52.479
I think my ex-husband
would describe me as selfish.

01:09:53.773 --> 01:09:57.150
You mustn't be angry with yourself
or disappointed.

01:09:57.318 --> 01:10:01.321
You don't have to make children
or be married to have a family.

01:10:03.324 --> 01:10:06.159
Oh, man. They got mosquitoes
here big enough...

01:10:06.327 --> 01:10:08.662
...to stand flat-footed
and screw a chicken.

01:10:09.998 --> 01:10:12.165
-l love you.
-Liz, have you met...

01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:14.668
-...Richard from Texas?
-Hello, Richard from Texas.

01:10:14.836 --> 01:10:17.170
-Nice to meet you, Groceries.
-Groceries?

01:10:17.338 --> 01:10:20.507
Yeah. Yeah, l heard you eating
before l saw you.

01:10:20.717 --> 01:10:23.510
I never seen anybody
eat so much at one time.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:26.013
You sure do enjoy your groceries.

01:10:26.764 --> 01:10:30.809
You know, it's been a rough day,
and if no one takes it personally...

01:10:30.977 --> 01:10:34.813
...l'm going to take my large meal
someplace else to eat it in silence.

01:10:34.981 --> 01:10:37.149
Oh, no, stay. I'm done.

01:10:41.529 --> 01:10:43.655
Looked like you were
working through some...

01:10:43.823 --> 01:10:46.491
...pretty rough stuff this morning.

01:10:46.659 --> 01:10:48.535
Stuff with your ex-husband?

01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:51.496
I got an ex-wife.

01:10:52.123 --> 01:10:55.167
She thinks l changed my name
to "Motherfucker."

01:10:58.546 --> 01:11:00.380
I--

01:11:00.882 --> 01:11:05.886
I just spent some time in Rome
and l came here feeling so great.

01:11:06.054 --> 01:11:09.514
And now here l am, at the source...

01:11:09.682 --> 01:11:12.559
...and l feel more disconnected
than ever.

01:11:13.394 --> 01:11:15.020
Why'd you come here?

01:11:16.564 --> 01:11:17.898
I just want some peace.

01:11:18.483 --> 01:11:20.233
Peace?

01:11:21.861 --> 01:11:24.529
You wanna get
to the castle, Groceries...

01:11:24.697 --> 01:11:26.281
...you got to swim the moat.

01:11:29.577 --> 01:11:32.579
Here, you can finish that.
I know you can.

01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:40.087
Okay.

01:11:40.588 --> 01:11:44.299
Simply empty your mind.

01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:45.926
Breathe.

01:11:47.929 --> 01:11:51.389
What am l going to do
when this year is over?

01:11:51.557 --> 01:11:53.266
Where am I going to live?

01:11:53.434 --> 01:11:54.726
Well, maybe Chicago.

01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:59.397
Oh, my God.
I could build a meditation room--

01:11:59.565 --> 01:12:03.568
No. Stop thinking.
Why is this so hard?

01:12:09.242 --> 01:12:11.743
Screw you, Corella.
How the hell does she do this?

01:12:11.911 --> 01:12:14.538
She looks like
frigging Mother Teresa.

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:19.459
Oh, my God, kill me.

01:12:22.547 --> 01:12:24.131
-Who's in the moat today?
-Shut up.

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:26.466
Sounds like you wrestled
some big-ass crocs.

01:12:26.634 --> 01:12:29.886
You know what? lf you're so goddamn
smart, what are you doing here?

01:12:30.054 --> 01:12:31.972
If you're here,
it makes you smart already.

01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:35.433
-Do you wanna talk about what--?
-No, not to you. Thank you.

01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:38.645
I'm the only one here. You're gonna
talk about it sooner or later.

01:12:38.855 --> 01:12:39.938
I cannot focus in there.

01:12:40.106 --> 01:12:44.359
All I think about is my meditation room
and how to decorate.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.487
Are you shitting me?

01:12:48.322 --> 01:12:49.322
Are you kidding me?

01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:52.826
The meditation room is within,
Groceries. Decorate that.

01:12:52.994 --> 01:12:54.786
Do you always talk
in bumper sticker?

01:12:54.954 --> 01:12:56.329
I do, and here's another one.

01:12:56.497 --> 01:12:59.499
You have to learn to select
your thoughts the way you select...

01:12:59.667 --> 01:13:02.502
...your clothes every day.
That's a power you can cultivate.

01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:05.922
You wanna come here and control
your life so bad, work on the mind.

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:07.966
That's the only thing
you should control.

01:13:08.134 --> 01:13:10.802
If you can't master your thoughts,
you're in trouble.

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:12.012
I am trying.

01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:15.182
Yeah, hello, that's the damn problem.
Stop trying. Surrender.

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:18.852
Go out into the garden
and just sit there and still your mind...

01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:20.520
...and you watch what happens.

01:13:20.688 --> 01:13:22.522
Why don't you just let it be?

01:13:24.525 --> 01:13:27.027
Has anyone ever told you
you look like James Taylor?

01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:32.908
Every day.

01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:42.083
God, he really does.

01:13:47.215 --> 01:13:48.882
My prayers were always the same.

01:13:49.050 --> 01:13:53.220
"Please, God, please.
Open my heart, send me a sign...

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:57.140
...because we both know
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed."

01:13:58.893 --> 01:14:01.228
Look at you,
floating through Calcutta.

01:14:01.896 --> 01:14:04.022
Looks like you had
a great meditation.

01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:05.899
I probably have malaria now.

01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:07.525
The bites will go away.

01:14:08.069 --> 01:14:09.903
Eventually everything goes away.

01:14:10.071 --> 01:14:12.739
You ever done that, Groceries?
Begged for a sign?

01:14:14.742 --> 01:14:16.076
That sounds vaguely familiar.

01:14:16.244 --> 01:14:18.703
Be careful what you wish for.
You just might get it.

01:14:18.871 --> 01:14:20.080
What is your problem?

01:14:20.248 --> 01:14:24.084
Did you fall in love
with the wrong woman or something?

01:14:24.752 --> 01:14:26.253
Excuse me, Miss Gilbert.

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:28.588
You have a phone call.

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:32.259
How's the Guru Gita treating you?

01:14:32.927 --> 01:14:36.096
Fine. You'd like her.

01:14:37.265 --> 01:14:39.683
Did you get my e-mail?

01:14:40.393 --> 01:14:44.354
Yeah. l'm sorry l didn't call sooner.

01:14:44.522 --> 01:14:45.939
Why didn't you?

01:14:46.107 --> 01:14:47.440
Because if l didn't respond...

01:14:47.608 --> 01:14:51.611
...we were still having a conversation.
I was still in it.

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:57.993
I'm sorry. We were just bad timing.

01:14:59.996 --> 01:15:04.624
I just wanted things to be easy.
We were good when things were easy.

01:15:04.792 --> 01:15:09.129
It's not that I need "easy" right now.
I just can't have "so hard."

01:15:11.424 --> 01:15:12.507
Well, you sound good.

01:15:13.384 --> 01:15:14.801
Stronger.

01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:16.303
So do you.

01:15:18.014 --> 01:15:19.639
Yeah, well, l'm an actor, Liz.

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.020
I got a part.

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:30.150
It's off-Broadway,
but it's pretty cool.

01:15:30.318 --> 01:15:32.485
I'm happy for you.

01:15:34.447 --> 01:15:36.156
All right.

01:15:36.324 --> 01:15:38.825
Well, l'll see you around, kid.

01:16:05.770 --> 01:16:06.853
Check you out.

01:16:07.063 --> 01:16:10.065
I have never seen you so focused.

01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:23.203
You need a Thums Up.

01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:29.876
No, no. No lips on the bottle.

01:16:30.086 --> 01:16:32.837
First rule in lndia is never
touch anything but yourself.

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:41.513
Oh, good God. That's, like,
five times sweeter than Coke.

01:16:45.559 --> 01:16:48.395
I think it might have
methamphetamines in it.

01:16:49.230 --> 01:16:51.147
We can only hope.

01:16:54.735 --> 01:16:56.069
I know you feel awful.

01:16:57.571 --> 01:16:59.864
But your life's changing.

01:17:00.032 --> 01:17:02.242
That's not a bad thing.

01:17:02.410 --> 01:17:06.037
And you're in the perfect place for it.
Surrounded by grace.

01:17:06.997 --> 01:17:11.209
I thought I was over him, but...

01:17:11.877 --> 01:17:12.919
...l love him.

01:17:13.379 --> 01:17:14.421
Big deal.

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:17.090
-So you fell in love with someone.
-l really miss him.

01:17:17.258 --> 01:17:18.758
So miss him.

01:17:18.926 --> 01:17:22.637
Send him some light and love every
time you think of him, then drop it.

01:17:23.431 --> 01:17:27.183
You know, if you could clear out
all that space in your mind...

01:17:27.351 --> 01:17:29.436
...that you're using
to obsess over this guy...

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:32.939
...and your failed marriage,
you'd have a vacuum with a doorway.

01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:36.276
And you know what the universe
would do with that doorway?

01:17:37.570 --> 01:17:40.947
Rush in. God would rush in.

01:17:41.157 --> 01:17:46.286
Fill you with more love
than you ever dreamed of. Man.

01:17:50.416 --> 01:17:52.292
Groceries.

01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:56.796
I think you have the capacity someday
to love the whole world.

01:18:02.178 --> 01:18:04.304
What do they sell over there?

01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:13.313
Ganesh. Remover of obstacles.

01:18:16.066 --> 01:18:17.859
I'm gonna need a lot of these.

01:18:18.027 --> 01:18:22.655
Speaking of elephants, there's a rogue
elephant on the loose in the area.

01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:24.324
He was with carnival.

01:18:24.492 --> 01:18:28.119
They say he is very,
very unpredictable and volatile.

01:18:28.287 --> 01:18:30.371
That just makes him more attractive
to her.

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:33.500
How'd you get to be so smart?
I'll bet it was the hard way.

01:18:33.667 --> 01:18:34.876
Don't change the subject.

01:18:35.628 --> 01:18:39.756
Well, when is this grieving phase
going to pass?

01:18:39.924 --> 01:18:42.258
You want a day on a calendar
you can circle?

01:18:42.426 --> 01:18:45.345
-Can you give me one?
-No. You got to do the work.

01:18:45.513 --> 01:18:48.181
Meditate and go to seva...

01:18:48.349 --> 01:18:51.559
...and most important, get your butt
down to the Geet every morning...

01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:53.019
...and something'll change.

01:18:53.187 --> 01:18:57.190
I just cannot get through the Guru Gita.
I can't find that feeling of devotion.

01:18:57.358 --> 01:19:01.444
Okay. Devotion's love. Pick somebody
or something you wanna devote it to.

01:19:01.612 --> 01:19:04.864
It doesn't have to be the guru.
It's all the same to her.

01:19:05.032 --> 01:19:07.242
This is about you.

01:19:08.786 --> 01:19:13.540
Can l tell you something, Groceries?
You got some serious control issues.

01:19:13.707 --> 01:19:15.542
Is it obvious?

01:19:15.709 --> 01:19:19.671
All right, Richard,
get out from inside my head now.

01:19:19.838 --> 01:19:20.880
Shut the door.

01:19:23.342 --> 01:19:26.052
-That's him?
-That's him.

01:19:26.554 --> 01:19:31.224
-He's hideous.
-No, he's not. He's cute.

01:19:31.392 --> 01:19:32.767
He's a Sagittarius.

01:19:33.394 --> 01:19:35.353
He studies computer programming
in Delhi.

01:19:35.521 --> 01:19:37.355
He has very good grades.

01:19:37.523 --> 01:19:40.900
And his family is very, very wealthy.

01:19:41.569 --> 01:19:46.906
He will be very conceited
and dictatorial.

01:19:48.075 --> 01:19:49.909
My life is over at 1 7.

01:19:56.917 --> 01:19:58.793
Tulsi.

01:22:34.908 --> 01:22:37.243
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the dance floor...

01:22:37.411 --> 01:22:40.580
...for their very first couples dance,
Liz and Stephen.

01:22:53.093 --> 01:22:54.969
My people.

01:22:55.596 --> 01:22:56.971
-Are you ready?
-l'm ready.

01:22:59.391 --> 01:23:01.434
-You look beautiful.
-Thank you.

01:23:01.602 --> 01:23:03.936
I married a hottie.

01:23:06.315 --> 01:23:09.358
-What is that? That's not our song.
-No, it is not.

01:23:09.526 --> 01:23:11.110
Baby, that's not our song.

01:23:11.278 --> 01:23:13.780
-Definitely not.
-Everybody's looking at us.

01:23:13.989 --> 01:23:17.241
It's okay. I'm gonna go talk to the guy.
It's gonna be fine.

01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:31.088
-l told you l'd get it.
-This is taking care of it?

01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:33.150
I owe you a wedding gift.
I didn't know what was appropriate.

01:24:35.696 --> 01:24:38.573
I wanted to tell you l've been...

01:24:38.949 --> 01:24:41.075
...dedicating my Guru Gita to you.

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:46.873
Imagining you happy
is what got me through it.

01:24:49.877 --> 01:24:52.044
What did it look like...

01:24:52.212 --> 01:24:54.380
...when I was happy?

01:24:58.010 --> 01:25:01.304
I imagine you and Rijul...

01:25:01.471 --> 01:25:04.473
...smiling and looking
at each other...

01:25:05.392 --> 01:25:07.852
...with love and kindness.

01:25:08.645 --> 01:25:11.397
It seemed very real.

01:25:13.817 --> 01:25:16.235
Thank you so much, Liz.

01:25:17.237 --> 01:25:20.197
That helps me to believe it as well.

01:25:36.548 --> 01:25:38.925
Thinking about your own wedding?

01:25:39.676 --> 01:25:41.427
Yeah, me too.

01:25:41.637 --> 01:25:45.431
The funny thing about weddings,
you end up thinking about yourself.

01:25:46.308 --> 01:25:51.228
Did you throw yourself a big shindig?
Big, white, floppy dress?

01:25:51.855 --> 01:25:57.610
Yep. l arranged it all.
Nobody forced me into anything.

01:25:57.778 --> 01:26:00.237
Yeah. And now
you can't forgive yourself.

01:26:00.405 --> 01:26:04.784
Honestly, I'm waiting for him
to forgive me.

01:26:04.952 --> 01:26:06.452
To release me.

01:26:06.662 --> 01:26:09.747
Waiting for him to forgive you
is a damn waste of time, Groceries.

01:26:09.915 --> 01:26:11.791
Forgive yourself.

01:26:13.085 --> 01:26:15.294
It's not that easy.

01:26:16.630 --> 01:26:18.130
Yeah.

01:26:33.814 --> 01:26:35.106
Good night, Richard.

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:37.775
-Follow me.
-l'm tired.

01:26:38.151 --> 01:26:39.443
Get your butt up here.

01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:08.848
It's not a pretty story...

01:27:09.808 --> 01:27:11.976
...but it's pretty classic.

01:27:12.728 --> 01:27:18.149
Too much alcohol, too many drugs,
too much mindless cheating.

01:27:19.943 --> 01:27:21.819
Just regret.

01:27:24.448 --> 01:27:26.699
Ocean of regret.

01:27:29.036 --> 01:27:31.370
I lost everything.

01:27:32.122 --> 01:27:34.540
My pride, my job.

01:27:35.333 --> 01:27:37.209
My family.

01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:42.006
I lost my family.

01:27:53.894 --> 01:27:58.397
One day after work, l stopped off
at a bar and I got shitfaced.

01:27:59.066 --> 01:28:01.484
I was a lot like you, you know.

01:28:01.651 --> 01:28:05.237
I was just-- I don't know.
I thought too much, I felt too....

01:28:06.782 --> 01:28:09.283
I wanted to feel nothing.

01:28:12.370 --> 01:28:14.205
I should've called a cab, but I didn't.

01:28:14.372 --> 01:28:17.625
I just got in my car
and l drove home.

01:28:21.588 --> 01:28:23.506
My little boy....

01:28:28.512 --> 01:28:31.555
He was 8 years old at the time.
He was pl--

01:28:36.228 --> 01:28:41.190
He was sitting in the driveway with his
little Hot Wheels, waiting for his lost...

01:28:41.358 --> 01:28:43.776
...drunk, miserable dad...

01:28:44.945 --> 01:28:47.738
...to come home and play with him.

01:28:49.324 --> 01:28:51.325
I didn't see him.

01:28:52.244 --> 01:28:57.623
I didn't. I just roared into that driveway
and l didn't see my little boy.

01:28:59.084 --> 01:29:01.710
But he-- No, he....

01:29:03.130 --> 01:29:05.256
He got out of the way.

01:29:09.970 --> 01:29:12.888
He was used to getting out of the way
when l was around.

01:29:14.224 --> 01:29:15.933
And l-- You know, I don't--

01:29:16.101 --> 01:29:17.893
I don't know.
I don't remember a thing.

01:29:18.061 --> 01:29:20.771
Next day, l woke up
and they were gone.

01:29:22.399 --> 01:29:27.319
My wife had been watching
what happened out the window.

01:29:28.155 --> 01:29:29.989
She just wasn't gonna....

01:29:31.825 --> 01:29:34.368
She just wasn't gonna
do it anymore.

01:29:35.495 --> 01:29:37.163
So....

01:29:41.835 --> 01:29:43.586
He's 1 8 now.

01:29:43.753 --> 01:29:47.381
He's in school and,
oh, God, he's so smart.

01:29:52.637 --> 01:29:55.639
God, he's so funny and he's....

01:29:58.185 --> 01:30:00.186
He's so sweet.

01:30:06.526 --> 01:30:08.444
I missed it all.

01:30:08.612 --> 01:30:10.487
I missed...

01:30:12.365 --> 01:30:15.784
...my son's growing up. Just missed it.

01:30:28.798 --> 01:30:30.549
Okay?

01:30:33.178 --> 01:30:34.720
Come here.

01:30:42.729 --> 01:30:43.729
Here's the deal.

01:30:44.564 --> 01:30:47.399
You're gonna stay here
till you forgive yourself.

01:30:47.567 --> 01:30:49.443
You hear me?

01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:53.447
Everything else
will take care of itself.

01:30:54.741 --> 01:30:57.576
Is this where you forgave yourself?

01:31:00.914 --> 01:31:03.582
I'm trying, Elizabeth.

01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:05.960
I am trying.

01:31:54.634 --> 01:31:56.218
Hey.

01:31:58.888 --> 01:32:02.808
I believe this is the song they were
supposed to play at our wedding.

01:32:39.262 --> 01:32:41.805
I did love you, Stephen.

01:32:48.563 --> 01:32:50.356
I know.

01:32:52.817 --> 01:32:55.319
But l still love you.

01:33:04.704 --> 01:33:06.789
So love me.

01:33:12.379 --> 01:33:14.546
But l miss you.

01:33:18.009 --> 01:33:20.302
So miss me.

01:33:21.304 --> 01:33:25.641
Send me love and light
every time you think of me...

01:33:25.809 --> 01:33:27.059
...then drop it.

01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:48.205
It won't last forever.

01:33:49.874 --> 01:33:52.000
Nothing does.

01:34:11.312 --> 01:34:13.397
-Bye-bye.
-Goodbye, Mr. Richard.

01:34:13.565 --> 01:34:15.441
I'll see you.

01:34:16.317 --> 01:34:19.778
Now that you're going,
who is gonna kick my ass every day?

01:34:19.946 --> 01:34:23.782
Oh, l'd stay till a monsoon
swept me away if I could. Bye-bye.

01:34:23.950 --> 01:34:26.201
But you've got bills to pay
and houses to build.

01:34:26.369 --> 01:34:29.455
You just keep doing the work
and move on with your life, will you?

01:34:29.622 --> 01:34:32.291
The man is getting on a plane
and you're still bossing me.

01:34:32.459 --> 01:34:37.921
I've got your whole list: move on,
use mosquito repellent and....

01:34:38.089 --> 01:34:41.258
I don't know. There were some
other things. I wrote them down.

01:34:45.889 --> 01:34:48.599
Go back to Texas, Richard.

01:34:57.567 --> 01:35:00.486
Well, l ain't getting
any prettier standing here.

01:35:02.906 --> 01:35:04.114
So l'm off.

01:35:14.167 --> 01:35:16.126
Hey, Groceries.

01:35:16.628 --> 01:35:17.836
Believe in love again.

01:35:41.736 --> 01:35:44.196
Liz. Liz, l've just taken
my badge off today.

01:35:44.364 --> 01:35:47.366
I've done so well.
Four weeks of silence. lt was so dull.

01:35:47.534 --> 01:35:49.910
But it's like a facelift
because your face...

01:35:50.078 --> 01:35:54.790
...you know, just relaxes and your
throat just drops down. It's a bargain.

01:35:54.958 --> 01:35:56.542
We've got so much to catch up on.

01:35:59.796 --> 01:36:05.342
Oh, golly. Good for you.
You will get so much out of that.

01:36:05.885 --> 01:36:09.346
And your throat will look amazing
as well.

01:36:13.309 --> 01:36:14.518
Excuse me, Elizabeth.

01:36:14.686 --> 01:36:17.563
They're asking you to report
to the seva office after dinner...

01:36:17.772 --> 01:36:19.064
...if you don't mind.

01:36:19.691 --> 01:36:22.067
We're taking you off
the floor-scrubbing team.

01:36:22.277 --> 01:36:25.737
There are about 50 devotees arriving
tomorrow from all over the world...

01:36:25.905 --> 01:36:29.408
...for a 1 0-day retreat and we'd
like you to be the key hostess.

01:36:29.909 --> 01:36:33.078
We ask that you don't take part
during the meditations.

01:36:33.288 --> 01:36:38.083
We need you to watch over the flock,
make sure everyone is all right.

01:36:38.418 --> 01:36:42.379
We call the person who does
this job Little Suzy Cream Cheese.

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:47.092
You need to be social and bubbly
and smiling all the time.

01:36:50.597 --> 01:36:52.431
Madam...

01:36:52.890 --> 01:36:54.933
...l'm your girl.

01:37:10.116 --> 01:37:12.951
So just find your suitcase,
it should be here somewhere...

01:37:13.119 --> 01:37:15.329
...and then head down the path
to your room.

01:37:16.372 --> 01:37:21.835
So the holy truth of the whole
adventure here in India is in one line:

01:37:22.211 --> 01:37:25.714
God dwells within you as you.

01:37:25.882 --> 01:37:28.133
God's not interested
in watching a performance...

01:37:28.343 --> 01:37:30.636
...of how a spiritual person
looks and behaves.

01:37:30.803 --> 01:37:33.722
The quiet girl who glides silently
through the place...

01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:37.726
...with a gentle, ethereal smile,
who is that person?

01:37:37.894 --> 01:37:42.147
That's lngrid Bergman
in The Bells of St. Mary's, not me.

01:37:42.357 --> 01:37:46.652
God dwells within me as me.

01:38:55.930 --> 01:38:58.223
Child tormented by demon.

01:39:05.231 --> 01:39:06.982
It looks like teething.

01:39:07.150 --> 01:39:09.067
Same thing.

01:39:12.447 --> 01:39:14.072
Your turn.

01:39:19.954 --> 01:39:21.246
Hello, Ketut.

01:39:22.039 --> 01:39:23.540
I'm very happy to meet you.

01:39:24.959 --> 01:39:26.585
You are a world traveler.

01:39:27.670 --> 01:39:29.921
No, I came to see you
about a year ago.

01:39:30.590 --> 01:39:33.925
-You girl from California?
-No, I girl from New York.

01:39:35.094 --> 01:39:36.428
Don't remember.

01:39:40.183 --> 01:39:42.434
Well, you told me
I should come back here to Bali.

01:39:42.602 --> 01:39:44.728
You said I could help you
with your English...

01:39:44.896 --> 01:39:47.272
...and you would teach me
the things that you know.

01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:52.611
You gave me this.

01:39:53.488 --> 01:39:55.280
Okay.

01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:03.789
You. You. l remember you.

01:40:03.956 --> 01:40:06.124
-Oh, good.
-You sad girl from New York.

01:40:06.292 --> 01:40:08.919
-Yes.
-You Liss. You came back.

01:40:09.086 --> 01:40:11.129
-l came back.
-You, you, you.

01:40:11.297 --> 01:40:12.422
Me, me, me.

01:40:12.715 --> 01:40:14.633
So long ago we meet.

01:40:14.801 --> 01:40:19.971
Last time, you have too much worry,
too much sorrow.

01:40:20.139 --> 01:40:23.099
Last time,
you look like sad old woman.

01:40:24.227 --> 01:40:26.895
Now you pretty.

01:40:27.063 --> 01:40:29.564
-Why so different?
-Well...

01:40:29.732 --> 01:40:31.983
...a lot of things, really.

01:40:32.151 --> 01:40:34.986
But l was in Rome for four months,
just feeding myself...

01:40:35.154 --> 01:40:37.614
...and then I went to live
at an ashram in lndia.

01:40:37.782 --> 01:40:40.158
Now, we put together.

01:40:40.326 --> 01:40:41.827
Exactly. That's why l'm here.

01:40:41.994 --> 01:40:44.329
-Ketut good for that.
-What'd you give him?

01:40:47.834 --> 01:40:50.335
Do you still want me to help you
with your English?

01:40:50.503 --> 01:40:52.629
English later, Liss.

01:40:52.797 --> 01:40:56.007
First, better idea.

01:41:00.471 --> 01:41:02.514
How old are these?

01:41:02.682 --> 01:41:05.350
From grandfather.
Very important spells.

01:41:05.518 --> 01:41:08.019
Also mantras, cures.

01:41:08.187 --> 01:41:10.438
Thousand years' worth.

01:41:10.606 --> 01:41:14.150
All I have, all l know, right here.

01:41:14.318 --> 01:41:15.485
You copy for me?

01:41:15.653 --> 01:41:17.696
Absolutely. l can go to town
and take these--

01:41:17.864 --> 01:41:19.698
No. You don't take.

01:41:22.952 --> 01:41:25.370
You copy here, better, Liss.

01:41:25.538 --> 01:41:28.081
I take a nap now. l very old.

01:41:30.209 --> 01:41:31.543
How old are you, Ketut?

01:41:31.711 --> 01:41:33.336
One hundred and one...

01:41:33.504 --> 01:41:36.715
...or maybe 64.

01:41:36.883 --> 01:41:39.217
Don't remember.

01:41:47.226 --> 01:41:49.394
This is gonna take me
the rest of my life.

01:41:49.562 --> 01:41:53.231
He make you pretty, find you husband,
you work hard for him.

01:41:53.399 --> 01:41:55.525
That's exactly opposite
of why l'm here.

01:41:55.693 --> 01:41:58.111
Everybody need husband.

01:42:04.118 --> 01:42:05.744
Would you mind getting me water?

01:42:05.912 --> 01:42:07.412
No.

01:42:07.622 --> 01:42:12.250
Fine. Keep making copies.
I get water.

01:42:26.098 --> 01:42:29.434
So, Liz, the Balinese believe
that Bali's the center of the universe.

01:42:29.602 --> 01:42:31.269
And here we are
in the center of Bali.

01:42:31.437 --> 01:42:33.772
You got the one bedroom,
got your fish pond.

01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:35.649
You got your own meditation temple.

01:42:35.942 --> 01:42:38.568
I tell you, since the bombing,
tourism's been way down...

01:42:38.736 --> 01:42:42.197
...so l can give you this place
at a very, very good price right now.

01:42:42.365 --> 01:42:44.282
Paradise.

01:42:47.036 --> 01:42:49.245
-l'll take it.
-People in Bali understand...

01:42:49.413 --> 01:42:52.457
...in order to stay happy,
must always know where you are...

01:42:52.667 --> 01:42:54.125
...every moment.

01:42:54.293 --> 01:42:58.922
Right here is perfect balance.
Right at meeting of heaven and earth.

01:43:00.132 --> 01:43:02.884
Not too much God,
not too much selfish.

01:43:03.052 --> 01:43:06.137
Otherwise, life too crazy.

01:43:06.305 --> 01:43:09.766
You lose balance, you lose power.

01:43:09.934 --> 01:43:13.311
In morning,
you do meditation from India.

01:43:13.813 --> 01:43:15.814
Serious. Very serious.

01:43:15.982 --> 01:43:18.108
In day, you enjoy Bali.

01:43:27.994 --> 01:43:30.996
Then in afternoon, come see me.

01:43:38.212 --> 01:43:40.964
End of day, you do new meditation.

01:43:41.132 --> 01:43:42.173
Very simple.

01:43:42.341 --> 01:43:46.011
Sit in silence and smile.

01:43:47.263 --> 01:43:48.638
I feel balanced already.

01:43:48.806 --> 01:43:50.181
Not so easy, Liss.

01:43:50.349 --> 01:43:55.020
Smile with face. Smile with mind.

01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:58.231
Even smile in liver.

01:44:00.151 --> 01:44:02.527
See you later, alligator.

01:45:15.434 --> 01:45:17.060
Oh, God.

01:45:17.228 --> 01:45:19.437
-Are you all right?
-Are you blind?

01:45:19.605 --> 01:45:24.442
-Please, let me take you to a doctor.
-l'm fine. l just--

01:45:28.114 --> 01:45:29.781
It looks bad.

01:45:29.949 --> 01:45:31.616
Very bad, Liss.

01:45:31.826 --> 01:45:34.953
-What happen?
-This idiot ran me off the road.

01:45:35.162 --> 01:45:36.955
A man? He rich?

01:45:38.290 --> 01:45:39.749
This very hot.

01:45:40.251 --> 01:45:43.294
-You need healer.
-l have you. You're a medicine man.

01:45:43.462 --> 01:45:47.090
-No. You need Wayan.
-Yeah.

01:45:57.017 --> 01:46:00.645
Jamu. Drink this.
Better than antibiotic.

01:46:06.986 --> 01:46:08.945
She make you drink this?

01:46:09.113 --> 01:46:11.156
-My name's Liz. What's yours?
-Tutti.

01:46:11.365 --> 01:46:13.491
Nice to meet you, Tutti.

01:46:13.659 --> 01:46:16.494
-Are you married?
-No.

01:46:22.501 --> 01:46:24.377
You sure? Not even once?

01:46:24.837 --> 01:46:26.754
Okay, well,
there was this one time...

01:46:26.922 --> 01:46:30.800
...but l find when l tell people in Bali
that I'm divorced, it upsets them.

01:46:30.968 --> 01:46:33.178
Me too, divorce.

01:46:33.387 --> 01:46:37.515
Divorce make you sad
and make you an outcast.

01:46:39.643 --> 01:46:42.520
You have no sex
for a long time, baby.

01:46:42.688 --> 01:46:44.189
I can tell by your knee.

01:46:44.398 --> 01:46:48.359
The cartilage very dry.
Hormones from sex lubricate joint.

01:46:48.527 --> 01:46:50.320
-Okay.
-l pray for you.

01:46:50.487 --> 01:46:53.114
We sisters.

01:46:53.574 --> 01:46:55.992
Armenia!

01:46:58.412 --> 01:47:00.038
Armenia from Brazil.

01:47:00.206 --> 01:47:01.998
Armenia, this is Liz from New York.

01:47:02.166 --> 01:47:04.375
-Hi.
-Lovely to meet you, Liz.

01:47:04.543 --> 01:47:06.294
Time for a banana root
hair treatment?

01:47:06.462 --> 01:47:09.547
-Yes, of course.
-lt makes the hair long and lustrous.

01:47:09.715 --> 01:47:13.885
Like Cher circa 1 975.

01:47:15.012 --> 01:47:16.679
Do you have a nice dress?

01:47:17.056 --> 01:47:18.056
One.

01:47:18.224 --> 01:47:20.225
Put it on tonight,
come to the Beach Shack.

01:47:20.434 --> 01:47:23.311
I'll introduce you to everyone.
The expats, the locals.

01:47:23.479 --> 01:47:25.396
You'll dance. You will love it.

01:47:25.564 --> 01:47:28.191
Oh, no, l don't think I can dance
with my leg like this.

01:47:28.359 --> 01:47:31.027
Of course you can. Leg no problem.

01:47:31.403 --> 01:47:33.196
You see.

01:47:33.822 --> 01:47:35.949
Now you have to come.

01:48:28.627 --> 01:48:32.255
Hi. Could I get a tequila on the rocks
with a lot of lime, please?

01:48:32.423 --> 01:48:34.132
Coming right up.

01:48:39.763 --> 01:48:41.264
Can l buy you a drink?

01:48:41.432 --> 01:48:42.974
No, thank you, I'm fine.

01:48:43.142 --> 01:48:45.143
I-- l almost killed you.

01:48:45.311 --> 01:48:48.313
I am sorry for that, really.

01:48:49.273 --> 01:48:51.649
-Hello.
-Hi.

01:48:51.817 --> 01:48:54.068
I'm sorry, really.

01:48:56.155 --> 01:48:57.655
Yeah.

01:49:08.375 --> 01:49:10.835
I'm sorry I'm laughing,
but it's amazing.

01:49:11.045 --> 01:49:14.672
I was actually listening to this song
in the car when the tape jumped.

01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:18.176
And l leaned over to fix it
and l ran you off the road.

01:49:18.927 --> 01:49:23.139
-Did you tell them to play it?
-No, no, no. I make them mixtapes.

01:49:23.349 --> 01:49:24.432
Mostly Brazilian music.

01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:28.853
But l'm also very much into
Phil Collins and Air Supply.

01:49:29.813 --> 01:49:33.191
You really shouldn't
say things like that out loud.

01:49:35.736 --> 01:49:36.778
Liz!

01:49:37.571 --> 01:49:41.157
-Hi.
-Oh, I see you've already met Felipe.

01:49:42.868 --> 01:49:47.205
Oh, of course. Two sad divorces.
You have so much in common.

01:49:50.793 --> 01:49:53.378
I have the perfect man for you.

01:49:53.962 --> 01:49:57.382
Just a little love affair.
Everyone has a little love affair in Bali.

01:50:00.010 --> 01:50:01.594
Isn't he charming? lan.

01:50:02.471 --> 01:50:03.721
Doesn't he look like Sting?

01:50:03.889 --> 01:50:06.391
Oh, yeah.
I made a very good mixtape of Sting.

01:50:12.898 --> 01:50:14.857
You should dance with him.

01:51:00.863 --> 01:51:02.405
Got you. Come on, l got you.

01:51:02.573 --> 01:51:04.949
That's gonna hurt tomorrow.

01:51:05.117 --> 01:51:07.618
All right. You know what?

01:51:07.786 --> 01:51:12.415
-That is it. We are going swimming.
-No, I don't even have my-- l--

01:51:12.583 --> 01:51:15.585
You don't have your-- You don't--

01:51:16.753 --> 01:51:17.962
You're so naked.

01:51:18.172 --> 01:51:20.965
Yeah, l'm naked.

01:51:21.300 --> 01:51:23.759
Armenia says everyone
should have a love affair.

01:51:23.927 --> 01:51:27.388
This is Bali. Everyone should have
a love affair in Bali.

01:51:27.556 --> 01:51:28.973
Yeah, but--

01:51:29.141 --> 01:51:31.142
Oh, God. No, no, no.

01:51:31.310 --> 01:51:33.686
-Love affairs are awesome, dude.
-They are. l just--

01:51:33.854 --> 01:51:35.480
I dated you 1 5 years ago.

01:51:35.689 --> 01:51:39.775
And l dated you six months ago.

01:51:39.943 --> 01:51:41.819
So l'm gonna go.

01:51:41.987 --> 01:51:43.988
You're not-- You're really--
You're going.

01:51:44.156 --> 01:51:45.990
But you're cute.

01:51:48.827 --> 01:51:50.328
I think I look good.

01:51:53.332 --> 01:51:54.373
Wait a minute.

01:51:54.541 --> 01:51:56.125
Oh, sorry. Here.

01:51:58.003 --> 01:51:59.670
-Thank you.
-Do you need a ride?

01:52:01.089 --> 01:52:03.007
That way I won't run you over again.

01:52:12.809 --> 01:52:14.936
Hello.

01:52:15.103 --> 01:52:17.939
-What time is it?
-Five a.m.

01:52:18.482 --> 01:52:21.025
Oh, you party hard.

01:52:21.193 --> 01:52:22.860
You really do.

01:52:23.028 --> 01:52:26.197
Thank you for....

01:52:26.365 --> 01:52:27.365
-The ride?
-Yeah.

01:52:27.533 --> 01:52:29.867
You're very welcome.
Need help with the bicycle?

01:52:30.035 --> 01:52:31.202
You keep it.

01:52:31.370 --> 01:52:33.371
Keep it? But it has a basket.

01:52:34.248 --> 01:52:36.249
It also has a bell.

01:52:56.144 --> 01:52:58.354
Good afternoon. How are you?

01:52:58.522 --> 01:52:59.564
What are you doing here?

01:52:59.773 --> 01:53:03.734
Well, l've brought you
Wayan's famous hangover cure...

01:53:03.902 --> 01:53:07.029
...because you drank
a little bit too much last night.

01:53:07.197 --> 01:53:11.242
And here it is.
Very delicious, as you can see...

01:53:11.410 --> 01:53:12.743
...and very tasty.

01:53:12.911 --> 01:53:15.413
Do you make it a habit of
walking into people's houses?

01:53:15.581 --> 01:53:18.541
Do you make it a habit of
sleeping with your front door open?

01:53:23.505 --> 01:53:25.047
It's a call. Moment.

01:53:26.592 --> 01:53:29.760
-Hello, darling. How are you?
-Can't get the coffee machine to work.

01:53:29.928 --> 01:53:32.263
Okay. l've told you 50 times.
It's very easy.

01:53:32.431 --> 01:53:34.432
You change the filter,
you add the coffee...

01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:37.727
...you add water and that's it.
How did you get into college?

01:53:37.894 --> 01:53:40.771
-How do l make it like you?
-Listen, l've been making coffee...

01:53:40.939 --> 01:53:44.942
...darling, for 40 years, so you have
to be patient with yourself. All right?

01:53:45.110 --> 01:53:48.613
Okay. So, what's up with you?

01:53:48.780 --> 01:53:52.074
-Nothing. l just can't talk right now.
-Holy shit. You're with a girl.

01:53:52.242 --> 01:53:54.118
-l have to go.
-Who is she? ls she hot?

01:53:54.286 --> 01:53:56.120
-Jesus, she's hot.
-Dad, if you hang up...

01:53:56.330 --> 01:53:58.581
...l'll call back and embarrass you.

01:53:58.749 --> 01:53:59.915
Dad, don't--

01:54:02.085 --> 01:54:04.462
That's a lot of "darlings," darling.

01:54:04.630 --> 01:54:06.130
Yeah. That darling was my son.

01:54:06.548 --> 01:54:09.634
I've called all my children "darling"
since they were little.

01:54:09.843 --> 01:54:12.803
Then there was a moment that
between the pets and the children...

01:54:12.971 --> 01:54:15.640
...l was confused,
so l called everybody "darling."

01:54:15.891 --> 01:54:17.391
Okay, you need to rest.

01:54:17.559 --> 01:54:20.061
Here is my number and my address.

01:54:20.228 --> 01:54:24.482
I'm gonna leave it here on the table,
in case you need a tour guide.

01:54:24.941 --> 01:54:26.651
A tour guide.

01:54:26.860 --> 01:54:31.072
And please, drink that up, because
it's gonna help you a big deal.

01:54:31.239 --> 01:54:33.366
Because you really look....

01:54:33.950 --> 01:54:37.495
-Ravishing?
-Astonishing.

01:54:37.663 --> 01:54:40.331
-Go away. Please.
-Okay. Drink it up.

01:54:40.499 --> 01:54:41.666
It's gonna be helpful.

01:54:49.257 --> 01:54:50.633
Hey, Mr. Tour Guide.

01:54:51.885 --> 01:54:53.344
Can we start with a coffee?

01:54:56.765 --> 01:54:58.182
Okay.

01:54:58.392 --> 01:54:59.850
What are these?

01:55:00.018 --> 01:55:01.852
These are rambutan.
They're delicious.

01:55:02.020 --> 01:55:05.606
It's like an orange made love
to a plum. Would you like some?

01:55:05.774 --> 01:55:08.526
When you put it that way,
yes, thank you.

01:55:09.194 --> 01:55:11.028
Excuse me.

01:55:12.406 --> 01:55:13.531
What is that?

01:55:14.616 --> 01:55:16.492
No, no, no.

01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:18.369
They taste like dirty feet.

01:55:18.537 --> 01:55:19.829
-Really?
-Dirty feet.

01:55:19.996 --> 01:55:21.539
They taste like feet.

01:55:21.707 --> 01:55:24.875
Look out. Nice.
How many places have you visited?

01:55:25.043 --> 01:55:29.213
I have 46 stamps on my passport.

01:55:29.423 --> 01:55:33.509
I happen to have 49 stamps
on my passport.

01:55:33.677 --> 01:55:35.720
-Forty-nine? I knew it.
-Yes.

01:55:35.929 --> 01:55:37.430
-Knew what?
-l knew it.

01:55:38.807 --> 01:55:41.183
We are both antevasins, my dear.

01:55:41.351 --> 01:55:42.393
What is that?

01:55:42.561 --> 01:55:44.729
Antevasin is....

01:55:45.564 --> 01:55:47.815
It's an in-between.

01:55:47.983 --> 01:55:50.067
It is the one who lives
by the border...

01:55:50.235 --> 01:55:53.654
...because they renounce
to the comfort of family life...

01:55:53.822 --> 01:55:56.824
...in order to seek "enlightment."

01:55:56.992 --> 01:55:58.909
I like your word.

01:55:59.077 --> 01:56:01.203
And l like the way
you say "enlightment."

01:56:01.371 --> 01:56:02.747
"Enlightment." I try.

01:56:02.956 --> 01:56:06.208
You're missing a syllable,
but I like it.

01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:08.586
It's beautiful, no?

01:56:08.754 --> 01:56:12.256
It's Pura Melanting,
which means "Temple of Prosperity."

01:56:13.049 --> 01:56:14.759
-Beautiful.
-Yup.

01:56:15.260 --> 01:56:17.928
-So next attraction of the tour?
-Yes.

01:56:18.096 --> 01:56:20.014
-Food from Bali.
-Oh, good. l'm starving.

01:56:20.182 --> 01:56:22.600
-Where should we go?
-To the best restaurant in town.

01:56:22.768 --> 01:56:25.102
-Of course.
-My place.

01:56:27.522 --> 01:56:28.898
Subtle.

01:56:29.775 --> 01:56:32.276
Did you always live in Brazil
before you came to Bali?

01:56:32.486 --> 01:56:33.778
No, no. Only for 20 years.

01:56:33.945 --> 01:56:38.199
Then l met my wife
and l moved with her to Australia.

01:56:38.366 --> 01:56:41.410
She traveled a lot
because of the job.

01:56:41.578 --> 01:56:45.122
-And I stayed home with the children.
-A good feminist husband.

01:56:45.290 --> 01:56:48.793
Yeah. Yeah. Didn't turn out to be
what she wanted, l'm afraid.

01:56:49.002 --> 01:56:50.461
-What happened?
-What happened?

01:56:50.629 --> 01:56:51.962
Well, the children were grown.

01:56:52.130 --> 01:56:57.802
And l run an import-export jewelry
business, so I could live anywhere.

01:56:58.011 --> 01:57:02.807
And Bali seemed like the perfect place
to recover from a divorce.

01:57:04.935 --> 01:57:07.937
And here l am. Here l am.

01:57:08.104 --> 01:57:09.772
-And you?
-Well, far less tragic.

01:57:09.940 --> 01:57:15.486
We were immature and really too
young to get married. We grew apart.

01:57:15.654 --> 01:57:17.154
Hearts were broken.

01:57:17.781 --> 01:57:19.657
Yes.

01:57:19.825 --> 01:57:21.909
Then it's the same.

01:57:27.541 --> 01:57:28.958
This is just perfect.

01:57:29.543 --> 01:57:31.418
So are you.

01:57:31.586 --> 01:57:34.463
You know what you are?
You're a falsa magra.

01:57:34.631 --> 01:57:36.507
-You know what that is?
-What?

01:57:36.675 --> 01:57:40.177
You are slender and elegant
in a distance...

01:57:40.345 --> 01:57:43.848
...but up close,
you are round and fleshy.

01:57:45.517 --> 01:57:47.560
Thank God for Brazilians.

01:57:51.481 --> 01:57:53.357
Stop that!

01:57:59.614 --> 01:58:01.699
You are a world traveler.

01:58:01.867 --> 01:58:03.200
He says that to everyone.

01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:05.494
Already make your money.

01:58:06.329 --> 01:58:09.331
You don't have young-man ambition.

01:58:10.166 --> 01:58:14.503
-He's good.
-You have three children.

01:58:14.671 --> 01:58:16.881
Two. That's a callous.

01:58:19.509 --> 01:58:20.843
And you have divorce.

01:58:22.095 --> 01:58:23.345
Very difficult.

01:58:23.513 --> 01:58:26.515
You loved her very much.

01:58:27.559 --> 01:58:29.101
You haven't healed that wound.

01:58:29.895 --> 01:58:34.106
Now you are scared
to open your heart.

01:58:35.066 --> 01:58:38.402
You are afraid
hurt will happen to you again.

01:58:39.112 --> 01:58:41.030
Only way to heal...

01:58:41.197 --> 01:58:43.741
...is to trust.

01:58:45.619 --> 01:58:49.872
This okay. To have broken heart
mean you have tried for something.

01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:57.087
Is it going to be broken again?

01:58:57.255 --> 01:58:59.423
He a good man, Liz.
You need a good man.

01:59:01.927 --> 01:59:03.594
Thank you.

01:59:03.762 --> 01:59:06.347
True. Ketut knows.

01:59:10.685 --> 01:59:13.562
I am so sick of people telling me
I need a man.

01:59:13.730 --> 01:59:17.775
You don't need a man, Liz.
You need a champion.

01:59:23.782 --> 01:59:27.117
-Some spring break, huh?
-Come on. You're moving like turtles.

01:59:27.285 --> 01:59:28.953
His enthusiasm is exhausting.

01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:31.455
Try being dropped off at school
when you're 1 0...

01:59:31.623 --> 01:59:33.791
...and having your father
kiss you on the mouth.

01:59:33.959 --> 01:59:35.542
He still does it.

01:59:35.710 --> 01:59:39.421
I'm sure it's all normal in Brazil,
but I didn't grow up in Brazil.

01:59:39.589 --> 01:59:41.382
Friends would tease
the crap out of me.

01:59:41.549 --> 01:59:43.050
Why didn't you ask him to stop?

01:59:43.218 --> 01:59:45.678
No, I did at first,
but then l realized...

01:59:45.845 --> 01:59:48.639
...how happy it made the old guy
and l just gave in.

01:59:48.807 --> 01:59:53.602
You know what? My grandmother
hikes faster than you both...

01:59:53.770 --> 01:59:56.230
...but she's already dead.

01:59:56.398 --> 01:59:59.149
Get him. Go get him.

01:59:59.317 --> 02:00:02.486
How about you carry the packs
for a while, eh?

02:00:02.737 --> 02:00:05.280
Come here. Look at this.

02:00:05.657 --> 02:00:07.574
Is it nice?

02:00:08.118 --> 02:00:09.159
Baby.

02:00:10.161 --> 02:00:12.246
Bringing up the rear.

02:00:22.007 --> 02:00:24.758
-So have you slept with her yet?
-What was that?

02:00:24.926 --> 02:00:26.301
Have you slept with her yet?

02:00:26.469 --> 02:00:28.178
Crossing the line.

02:00:28.346 --> 02:00:32.141
Dad, it's been 1 0 years. lt's time.

02:00:44.612 --> 02:00:46.989
Stay away from
all the beautiful girls.

02:00:47.157 --> 02:00:49.533
They are dangerous.

02:00:54.372 --> 02:00:56.123
-A week is too short.
-Yeah.

02:00:56.291 --> 02:00:59.209
-A week is too short.
-Yup.

02:00:59.794 --> 02:01:03.172
Listen, l've made you a mixtape.

02:01:03.882 --> 02:01:06.383
And l give you a present. For you.

02:01:08.553 --> 02:01:09.762
Thank you.

02:01:09.929 --> 02:01:12.723
I'm missing you already.

02:01:20.565 --> 02:01:22.316
Bye, Liz.

02:01:24.569 --> 02:01:27.029
-Be safe.
-Same to you.

02:01:29.532 --> 02:01:31.075
So don't I get a kiss?

02:01:31.284 --> 02:01:33.077
I don't know.

02:01:35.538 --> 02:01:38.165
-l love you, Dad.
-l love you too.

02:01:52.430 --> 02:01:55.099
So stupid, I know.

02:01:55.683 --> 02:02:00.604
He's 1 9 years old
and he's such a man.

02:02:02.398 --> 02:02:04.233
It's sweet.

02:02:04.567 --> 02:02:06.443
You're sweet.

02:03:40.705 --> 02:03:42.497
Darling...

02:03:42.665 --> 02:03:44.541
...it's time.

02:04:37.512 --> 02:04:38.553
-Liz.
-What?

02:04:38.721 --> 02:04:42.099
Liz. Come here.
I have to tell you something.

02:04:48.273 --> 02:04:50.941
No. I should really,
really be meditating.

02:04:52.277 --> 02:04:54.403
Go, go. Do it.

02:05:00.994 --> 02:05:03.412
You know, I have not been
to see Ketut in two weeks.

02:05:03.579 --> 02:05:04.621
-Really?
-Yes.

02:05:04.789 --> 02:05:06.999
-Okay. Go, go.
-Okay.

02:05:10.378 --> 02:05:14.298
Oh, gosh. But you are just
so much cuter than Ketut.

02:05:17.135 --> 02:05:21.305
No, I have to go. I have to go.

02:05:28.479 --> 02:05:30.272
Why?

02:05:42.535 --> 02:05:44.953
You have bladder infection.

02:05:45.121 --> 02:05:49.666
Common after no sex,
then too much sexy time.

02:05:49.834 --> 02:05:53.420
We haven't even been apart
for a minute in two weeks.

02:05:58.760 --> 02:06:01.178
You're afraid now, right?

02:06:01.346 --> 02:06:02.679
I understand.

02:06:02.847 --> 02:06:04.973
You don't want to lose yourself.

02:06:05.350 --> 02:06:08.518
Love is scary, dangerous.

02:06:08.686 --> 02:06:10.187
Happen to me.

02:06:11.522 --> 02:06:15.192
I pray every day,
but husband bad for me.

02:06:15.693 --> 02:06:17.569
I have to get away from him.

02:06:18.863 --> 02:06:22.157
This from where he hit me...

02:06:22.325 --> 02:06:23.867
...with motorcycle helmet.

02:06:24.869 --> 02:06:27.162
And then my daughter...

02:06:28.039 --> 02:06:30.165
...she begged me to leave him.

02:06:30.333 --> 02:06:31.875
Is that right, honey?

02:06:32.085 --> 02:06:34.878
I said, "I think you should
get a divorce, Mommy."

02:06:35.088 --> 02:06:38.673
She was 4 years old
when she said it.

02:06:43.846 --> 02:06:46.807
Don't feel bad about Felipe.

02:06:46.974 --> 02:06:49.559
Everybody needs affection, honey.

02:06:49.727 --> 02:06:51.728
Make people do funny things.

02:06:51.896 --> 02:06:55.232
Everyone gets like that
at beginning of relationship.

02:06:55.400 --> 02:06:59.027
Want too much happiness,
too much pleasure...

02:06:59.195 --> 02:07:02.197
...until make yourself sick.

02:07:02.615 --> 02:07:06.910
Even to Wayan, this happen
at beginning of my love affair.

02:07:07.120 --> 02:07:09.913
I lose myself, Liz.

02:07:11.624 --> 02:07:13.208
Dear friends and loved ones:

02:07:13.376 --> 02:07:15.085
My birthday's coming up soon.

02:07:15.253 --> 02:07:17.754
If I were home, l'd be planning
a stupid, expensive...

02:07:17.922 --> 02:07:21.883
...birthday party and you'd all be
buying me gifts and bottles of wine.

02:07:22.051 --> 02:07:25.053
A cheaper, more lovely way
to celebrate would be to...

02:07:25.221 --> 02:07:27.973
...make a donation to help a healer
named Wayan Nuriyasih...

02:07:28.141 --> 02:07:30.267
...buy a house in Indonesia.

02:07:30.435 --> 02:07:33.603
She's a single mother.
ln Bali, after a divorce...

02:07:33.771 --> 02:07:36.523
...a woman gets nothing,
not even her children.

02:07:36.691 --> 02:07:40.735
To gain custody of her daughter, Tutti,
Wayan had to sell everything...

02:07:40.903 --> 02:07:43.447
...even her bath mat,
to pay for a lawyer.

02:07:44.449 --> 02:07:46.450
For years,
they've moved from place to place.

02:07:46.659 --> 02:07:50.287
Each time, Wayan loses clientele
and Tutti has to change schools.

02:07:51.205 --> 02:07:55.125
This little group of people in Bali
have become my family.

02:07:55.293 --> 02:07:58.795
And we must take care of our
families, wherever we find them.

02:07:58.963 --> 02:08:02.299
Today l saw Tutti playing with
a blue tile she'd found in the road...

02:08:02.467 --> 02:08:05.135
...near a hotel construction site.
She told me:

02:08:05.303 --> 02:08:07.971
Maybe if we have
a house someday...

02:08:08.181 --> 02:08:10.974
...it can have a pretty blue floor
like this.

02:08:11.809 --> 02:08:13.602
When I was in Italy,
I learned a word--

02:08:13.769 --> 02:08:15.020
It's "tutti" with double T.

02:08:15.980 --> 02:08:20.442
--which in ltalian means "everybody."
So that's the lesson, isn't it?

02:08:20.610 --> 02:08:23.153
When you set out in the world
to help yourself...

02:08:23.321 --> 02:08:25.614
...sometimes you end up
helping Tutti.

02:08:28.951 --> 02:08:32.162
-Tell me again.
-Eighteen thousand American dollars.

02:08:32.330 --> 02:08:34.998
I brought you the e-mails to look at.

02:08:37.460 --> 02:08:38.668
Oh, my God.

02:08:38.836 --> 02:08:40.128
We get a house.

02:08:40.296 --> 02:08:43.507
It can be the house for everybody!

02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:48.845
I can have a pharmacy!
I can have a library!

02:08:50.014 --> 02:08:52.682
-All right. Oh, God.
-Close them again. Close your eyes.

02:08:52.850 --> 02:08:55.185
Careful. You don't wanna
break a tooth or anything.

02:08:55.353 --> 02:08:58.188
-Don't worry, but close your eyes.
-Where are you taking me?

02:08:58.356 --> 02:08:59.356
You will see.

02:08:59.524 --> 02:09:02.025
-You helped Wayan to get a house...
-l know.

02:09:02.193 --> 02:09:03.693
...and we're going to celebrate.

02:09:03.861 --> 02:09:05.487
-Here, here, here.
-All right.

02:09:05.655 --> 02:09:08.156
-Turn, turn, turn.
-l know we're at the beach.

02:09:08.324 --> 02:09:10.200
Here you go.

02:09:11.369 --> 02:09:13.328
We're going to take a little boat trip.

02:09:14.539 --> 02:09:15.539
Where?

02:09:15.748 --> 02:09:18.708
Where? To a little island nearby.

02:09:18.876 --> 02:09:22.379
It's my favorite place in the world.
I've packed for two.

02:09:22.547 --> 02:09:27.384
We can stay there until next Tuesday.
And l have the perfect camping spot.

02:09:27.885 --> 02:09:31.555
Just you and l and 400 parrots.

02:09:34.392 --> 02:09:36.518
Do you like it?

02:09:38.563 --> 02:09:43.233
I was going to save it for tonight,
but I think this is the right moment.

02:09:43.401 --> 02:09:46.194
I have to be in Bali
because my business is here...

02:09:46.362 --> 02:09:48.071
...and you have to be in New York...

02:09:48.239 --> 02:09:50.907
...because that's
where your life is, right?

02:09:51.409 --> 02:09:55.370
What if we tried to create a life that
is divided between the two places?

02:10:00.543 --> 02:10:02.294
Why would you wanna do that?

02:10:02.795 --> 02:10:04.921
Because I'm in love with you.

02:10:10.553 --> 02:10:12.804
-Let's go. Let's go.
-Oh, no. I....

02:10:13.931 --> 02:10:16.057
-What?
-l can't. l'm sorry.

02:10:16.601 --> 02:10:17.767
-l just....
-You can't?

02:10:17.935 --> 02:10:19.436
-l'm sorry. I can't.
-Can't what?

02:10:19.604 --> 02:10:24.441
I can't go on a trip right now,
okay? I....

02:10:24.609 --> 02:10:28.445
I haven't been home in five days.
I haven't seen Ketut in weeks.

02:10:28.613 --> 02:10:31.114
-lt's just too much.
-lt's not much.

02:10:33.784 --> 02:10:35.452
To go...

02:10:35.620 --> 02:10:37.120
...by ourselves...

02:10:37.288 --> 02:10:41.625
...apart from everything else for
a couple of days, is that much for you?

02:10:41.834 --> 02:10:44.878
Liz, nÃ£o entendo.
What's the problem, Liz?

02:10:45.046 --> 02:10:48.715
I mean, l have the same fears,
I have the same scars that you have...

02:10:48.883 --> 02:10:50.925
...and l show them to you.

02:10:51.093 --> 02:10:54.721
But l guess the only difference
between you and l is that...

02:10:55.097 --> 02:10:56.806
...you are afraid to love again.

02:10:56.974 --> 02:10:58.350
My darling, this is it.

02:10:58.726 --> 02:11:01.645
You have to look me in the eye
and let me know the truth.

02:11:02.271 --> 02:11:06.107
Please. Do you love me
or do you love me not?

02:11:10.154 --> 02:11:11.738
Look me in the eyes and tell me...

02:11:11.906 --> 02:11:15.367
...do you love me or don't
you love me not? lt's very easy.

02:11:15.951 --> 02:11:18.495
I know you feel the same way.
Why can't you say it back?

02:11:18.663 --> 02:11:20.747
I don't know why.

02:11:22.792 --> 02:11:24.000
Why can't l?

02:11:24.168 --> 02:11:27.504
Because you're terrified, my love.
But listen, it's fine. Me too.

02:11:27.880 --> 02:11:30.840
But l still want to get
into that boat with you.

02:11:31.008 --> 02:11:33.510
-No. Okay, look. Look.
-What?

02:11:33.678 --> 02:11:36.680
I don't know why
you can't understand this.

02:11:36.889 --> 02:11:40.433
I found something
and l can't give it up.

02:11:40.601 --> 02:11:44.854
And trust me, if I did,
you wouldn't be so all in love with me.

02:11:45.022 --> 02:11:48.525
Okay, the balance thing. You traveled
around the world to find your balance.

02:11:48.693 --> 02:11:51.194
And the balance that you think
you've found is what?

02:11:51.404 --> 02:11:55.323
Meditating for 20 minutes and
going to see an old medicine man?

02:11:55.491 --> 02:11:59.202
Listen, balance, my darling, balance
is not letting anybody love you...

02:11:59.412 --> 02:12:02.372
-...less than you love yourself.
-You know what? You know what?

02:12:02.540 --> 02:12:06.459
Do not tell me what lessons l have
and haven't learned in the last year...

02:12:06.627 --> 02:12:09.045
...and don't tell me how balanced
and wise you are...

02:12:09.213 --> 02:12:11.548
...and how I can't express myself.

02:12:11.716 --> 02:12:15.385
And do not say "darling" to me again
because l am just gonna lose it.

02:12:15.553 --> 02:12:19.848
Listen to me! l do not need to love you
to prove that l love myself.

02:12:26.814 --> 02:12:28.732
Run away from me?

02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:34.863
You are running away from all
the great possibilities of your own life.

02:12:38.701 --> 02:12:41.077
I'm getting into that boat.

02:14:08.332 --> 02:14:09.499
For you.

02:14:09.667 --> 02:14:12.001
A goodbye gift.

02:14:20.344 --> 02:14:21.845
Ketut.

02:14:32.857 --> 02:14:34.691
Liss...

02:14:35.067 --> 02:14:37.318
...you healed me.

02:14:39.488 --> 02:14:41.990
You healed me too, Ketut.

02:14:44.618 --> 02:14:47.620
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't have come back to Bali...

02:14:47.788 --> 02:14:50.540
...and l wouldn't have come back
to myself.

02:14:50.708 --> 02:14:53.001
You want coffee? Roast pig?

02:14:54.461 --> 02:14:56.045
Coffee.

02:14:56.213 --> 02:14:57.505
I get you coffee.

02:14:57.673 --> 02:14:59.549
You fly back to America soon?

02:14:59.717 --> 02:15:01.885
In two hours.

02:15:02.052 --> 02:15:03.887
Have you ever been
on an airplane, Ketut?

02:15:04.597 --> 02:15:07.390
Ketut cannot fly on aeroplane.

02:15:08.726 --> 02:15:11.227
Ketut have no teeths.

02:15:14.899 --> 02:15:18.067
You are good friend to me.

02:15:18.235 --> 02:15:19.903
You are like daughter.

02:15:21.030 --> 02:15:23.156
When I die...

02:15:23.324 --> 02:15:26.701
...you will come back to Bali?
Come to my cremation?

02:15:27.620 --> 02:15:30.121
Balinese cremation ceremony
is very fun.

02:15:30.915 --> 02:15:32.916
-You will like it.
-Okay.

02:15:34.376 --> 02:15:39.380
You still smile with your liver,
like l tell you?

02:15:39.548 --> 02:15:40.590
Yes.

02:15:40.758 --> 02:15:44.761
You still meditate like your guru
in India teach you?

02:15:45.137 --> 02:15:47.138
-Yes.
-You happy now with God?

02:15:48.223 --> 02:15:52.060
-Yes.
-You love your new boyfriend?

02:15:57.942 --> 02:15:59.859
I ended it.

02:16:01.654 --> 02:16:03.905
Don't understand.
Why you do that?

02:16:07.785 --> 02:16:10.787
I couldn't keep my balance.

02:16:12.289 --> 02:16:16.376
Liss, listen to Ketut.

02:16:16.543 --> 02:16:20.713
Sometimes to lose balance
for love...

02:16:20.881 --> 02:16:25.176
...is part of living balanced life.

02:16:39.316 --> 02:16:41.150
In the end...

02:16:41.317 --> 02:16:46.114
...I've come to believe in something
I call "The Physics of the Quest."

02:16:48.157 --> 02:16:52.995
A force in nature governed by laws
as real as the laws of gravity.

02:16:53.496 --> 02:16:57.000
The rule of Quest Physics
goes something like this:

02:16:57.209 --> 02:17:01.295
If you're brave enough to leave behind
everything familiar and comforting...

02:17:01.463 --> 02:17:04.966
...which can be anything from your
house to bitter, old resentments...

02:17:05.134 --> 02:17:07.677
...and set out
on a truth-seeking journey...

02:17:07.844 --> 02:17:10.805
...either externally or internally...

02:17:10.973 --> 02:17:13.516
...and if you are truly willing
to regard everything...

02:17:13.683 --> 02:17:16.686
...that happens to you on that journey
as a clue...

02:17:16.853 --> 02:17:21.357
...and if you accept everyone you
meet along the way as a teacher...

02:17:25.862 --> 02:17:28.364
...and if you are prepared,
most of all...

02:17:28.531 --> 02:17:32.869
...to face and forgive some
very difficult realities about yourself...

02:17:33.037 --> 02:17:35.370
...then the truth
will not be withheld from you.

02:17:36.040 --> 02:17:37.790
Felipe?

02:17:50.137 --> 02:17:52.388
I can't help but believe it,
given my experience.

02:18:25.755 --> 02:18:28.299
I decided on my word.

02:18:36.433 --> 02:18:38.433
It means:

02:18:40.270 --> 02:18:42.605
"Let's cross over."
