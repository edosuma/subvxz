00:50.842 --> 00:53.219
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED IN A DYSTOPIAN KOREA

00:53.303 --> 00:55.805
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

00:56.347 --> 01:00.769
INSPECTOR YOON SU-HYEON

01:00.852 --> 01:02.729
Salute and respect!

01:06.566 --> 01:08.401
Su-hyeon!

01:08.485 --> 01:09.861
My baby…

01:09.944 --> 01:12.363
My poor Su-hyeon…

01:52.821 --> 01:54.030
You're not hurt, are you?

01:56.032 --> 01:57.283
I love you, you know!

02:24.227 --> 02:25.311
Will you marry me?

02:27.147 --> 02:28.064
I love you.

02:28.857 --> 02:30.859
<i>Just kidding, you punk. I don't love you.</i>

02:34.821 --> 02:36.197
Maybe just a little.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.702
-Bye!
-Sure, stay safe.

02:40.785 --> 02:41.911
Take care.

02:48.084 --> 02:49.252
Watch your step.

02:59.637 --> 03:01.222
Talk about taste.

03:01.306 --> 03:02.473
Do you really have to?

03:02.557 --> 03:04.392
That's the excuse you used.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.688
I'll be careful. Don't worry.

04:10.792 --> 04:11.709
Su-hyeon.

04:24.305 --> 04:25.974
<i>Because I just want to love you
for the rest of my life.</i>

04:29.143 --> 04:31.479
I love you a lot, Su-hyeon.

04:59.674 --> 05:00.967
<i>I, Kim Ga-on,</i>

05:01.884 --> 05:05.930
do solemnly swear
that I will administer justice

05:06.014 --> 05:11.060
with a clear conscience and in conformity
with the Constitution and other acts,

05:11.144 --> 05:13.730
and impartially discharge
and perform all duties

05:13.813 --> 05:18.735
incumbent upon me
to serve the people of Korea.

05:24.032 --> 05:27.160
SWEARING-IN CEREMONY OF NEW JUDGES

05:36.335 --> 05:39.380
Say cheese. One, two, three.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.803
-Please.
-Hurry up.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.639
Come in closer.

05:48.723 --> 05:50.433
You two take one together without me.

05:50.516 --> 05:51.768
-Count me out.
-No.

05:51.851 --> 05:52.852
Oh, come on.

05:53.895 --> 05:54.979
One more now.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.148
Please smile for this one.

05:57.231 --> 06:00.777
One, two, three!

06:03.029 --> 06:05.740
Red light, green light!

06:10.244 --> 06:13.081
Red light, green light!

06:16.292 --> 06:19.212
Red light, green light!

06:22.215 --> 06:24.509
Red light, green light!

06:31.682 --> 06:34.227
Ga-on, stop crying.

06:34.310 --> 06:35.478
It's okay.

06:42.985 --> 06:44.987
It's okay.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.948
That's nothing.

06:48.616 --> 06:49.784
Don't cry.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.078
I love you.

06:57.667 --> 06:58.835
<i>Don't cry.</i>

07:01.170 --> 07:02.797
Don't cry, Ga-on.

07:04.799 --> 07:06.259
Don't cry.

07:08.511 --> 07:09.679
Ga-on…

07:14.225 --> 07:16.310
Ga-on, I love you.

07:46.340 --> 07:48.217
YOON SU-HYEON

08:20.500 --> 08:21.667
Su-hyeon…

08:23.085 --> 08:24.295
Su-hyeon…

08:29.926 --> 08:31.219
Su-hyeon…

08:40.228 --> 08:41.312
Su-hyeon…

09:40.162 --> 09:41.372
How are you feeling?

09:51.507 --> 09:52.633
What about the culprit?

09:53.467 --> 09:54.760
Did you catch him?

09:59.849 --> 10:02.268
We need to catch him.

10:02.351 --> 10:05.521
-Where do you think you're going?
-Let go of me. I need to catch him.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.857
Ga-on, where are you going?

10:07.940 --> 10:09.609
-Let go!
-Stop it!

10:11.152 --> 10:12.278
Please.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.824
What if you die too, Ga-on?

10:18.576 --> 10:20.953
What would Su-hyeon say then?

10:21.037 --> 10:23.289
Do you want to take a bullet
in the middle of the street?

10:25.416 --> 10:27.877
Do you think that's what
Su-hyeon would want?

10:34.216 --> 10:36.469
Stay here.

10:38.387 --> 10:39.930
Stay here for now, and…

10:41.015 --> 10:42.933
we'll discuss this with Yo-han,

10:44.310 --> 10:46.437
and do something about it.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.046
Have you calmed down now?

11:55.631 --> 11:58.092
Who was it that shot Su-hyeon?

12:00.052 --> 12:01.512
She wasn't their target.

12:03.013 --> 12:06.600
They were trying to eliminate us
amidst the chaos.

12:07.601 --> 12:10.479
-The Department of Live Court Show?
-Think about it.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.232
Think about everything
that the Foundation has done.

12:14.692 --> 12:16.402
First they halted the broadcast,

12:16.485 --> 12:19.071
and next they cut off the power
for that entire area.

12:24.201 --> 12:26.996
That shows they were in a rush.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.664
But when that didn't work,

12:28.747 --> 12:30.791
they probably tried to
get rid of us for good.

12:50.728 --> 12:52.062
Then Su-hyeon…

12:55.649 --> 12:56.942
Are you saying

12:57.860 --> 12:59.528
she died instead of me?

13:22.051 --> 13:25.513
I know exactly how you feel.

13:31.727 --> 13:33.145
It must be hell.

13:34.522 --> 13:37.191
A hell you can never escape from.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.280
I know…

13:45.658 --> 13:47.243
because I'm down there too.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.627
So if you have time to cry,

13:57.670 --> 14:01.340
make those bastards
who did this burn in hell.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.343
That's the only way to survive it.

14:10.558 --> 14:12.393
Did you catch that Jukchang bastard?

14:17.481 --> 14:21.569
We'll have to start with him first
if we want to punish the Foundation.

14:31.245 --> 14:32.371
Let's begin.

14:33.706 --> 14:34.957
I'm ready.

14:54.935 --> 14:57.938
The emergency aid workers
dispatched by the government

14:58.022 --> 15:00.941
inflicted violence
against innocent citizens,

15:01.025 --> 15:03.319
even brutally murdered one elderly man.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.323
Furthermore,
one police officer has lost her life

15:07.406 --> 15:09.408
to an unidentified assailant who shot her.

15:10.951 --> 15:13.704
Despite all this, the government
continues to remain silent.

15:14.705 --> 15:17.875
I will bring this state violence
before the court

15:17.958 --> 15:21.003
and hold all those involved responsible.

15:22.671 --> 15:26.175
But the President has announced
the launch of the Emergency Court

15:26.258 --> 15:28.886
after disbanding
the Department of Live Court Show.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.805
Let me make it clear right here

15:31.889 --> 15:34.600
that I have no intention whatsoever
to participate

15:34.683 --> 15:38.979
in the Department of Emergency Court
that oppresses our citizens.

15:40.022 --> 15:42.107
The trial has already begun.

15:47.404 --> 15:48.614
INNOCENT, GUILTY

15:48.697 --> 15:51.951
Over five million citizens
have already voted "Guilty."

15:53.702 --> 15:55.996
So if anyone tries to stop this trial,

15:56.664 --> 15:57.748
they…

15:59.750 --> 16:01.210
are the offenders.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.379
DEPARTMENT OF LIVE COURT SHOW
VOWS TO PUNISH STATE VIOLENCE

16:03.462 --> 16:05.089
Look at that punk.

16:05.172 --> 16:07.800
That's explicit blackmailing.

16:08.842 --> 16:11.428
So he'll promise trouble
if we try and stop him, will he?

16:11.512 --> 16:12.763
Listen.

16:12.846 --> 16:17.434
Your obsessions with viewership
has gotten us into this mess.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.895
How will you get us out of this?

16:19.979 --> 16:23.065
Who knew that Oh Jin-joo
would stab us in the back like so?

16:23.148 --> 16:25.401
I mean she was one ambitious wench.

16:25.484 --> 16:26.902
So what happened to her?

16:26.986 --> 16:29.113
She even had
her eyes on the Chief Justice seat.

16:29.196 --> 16:31.156
I guess she plans on
getting there herself.

16:31.740 --> 16:34.326
Well, she did sparkle
the brightest among them.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.745
Sparkle, sparkle…

16:36.829 --> 16:39.331
Sparkle, sparkle?
Are you fiddling while we burn?

16:39.415 --> 16:41.667
If all of this gets exposed,
there will be a riot!

16:41.750 --> 16:43.293
We'll all be stoned to death!

16:45.254 --> 16:46.672
Then let them.

16:47.589 --> 16:50.259
-Let them do the trial.
-What?

16:50.342 --> 16:51.719
We absolutely cannot!

16:51.802 --> 16:54.596
Let's first put a gag on the media,
and suppress the Supreme--

16:54.680 --> 16:56.849
But the entire nation saw it live.

16:56.932 --> 17:00.436
That old man was
beaten to death with a steel pipe!

17:03.731 --> 17:06.066
It's too dangerous.
We can't allow any more of that.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.278
For now…

17:11.030 --> 17:12.948
We should cut off the tail first.

17:19.788 --> 17:24.084
This is a tragedy born out of
excessive competition

17:24.168 --> 17:28.213
and overdrive by some,
but not all workers at the scene.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.759
On behalf of our government,
I offer my deepest apologies…

17:33.594 --> 17:35.804
to the deceased
and their bereaved families.

17:41.769 --> 17:46.190
However, this does not mean
production and propagation

17:46.273 --> 17:49.359
of groundless propaganda
that slanders our emergency quarantine

17:49.443 --> 17:52.696
and relief operations is allowed
under any circumstances.

17:52.780 --> 17:56.325
If something like that

17:56.408 --> 17:58.869
should ever arise in the upcoming trial,

17:58.952 --> 18:04.541
I will consider it an act of treason
against our country!

18:13.175 --> 18:14.593
Good work.

18:17.304 --> 18:18.514
But the issue here isn't

18:20.766 --> 18:22.893
the assault and the death of that old man.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.229
It's the virus.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.399
We should get ready.

18:31.026 --> 18:32.820
What do you mean by getting ready?

18:32.903 --> 18:36.490
Well, there is lots of talk about
whether the virus has re-emerged or not.

18:37.741 --> 18:39.368
Why don't we just spread it?

18:39.451 --> 18:41.829
As long as there really is a virus, right?

18:41.912 --> 18:43.997
So let them find it

18:44.081 --> 18:46.667
in one of the slums
at the outskirts of the city.

18:46.750 --> 18:47.835
Don't tell me…

18:49.086 --> 18:51.713
you're not thinking of
disseminating it, are you?

18:55.050 --> 18:57.469
If we need to, we must.

18:58.595 --> 19:00.305
You see,

19:01.890 --> 19:04.476
a leader sometimes
needs to swallow back his tears

19:04.560 --> 19:07.646
and make small sacrifices
for a greater good.

19:07.729 --> 19:10.482
I know even I will be faced

19:11.316 --> 19:13.777
with such a lonely dilemma
at one time or another.

19:13.861 --> 19:17.197
You know how it is
in the Hollywood movies.

19:17.281 --> 19:21.285
They cross their hearts,
and press down hard on the nuke button!

19:31.753 --> 19:34.214
Is something wrong? Do you have a problem?

19:35.465 --> 19:36.675
It's nothing.

19:37.718 --> 19:38.927
I'm just touched.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.056
Chairwoman Jung, your tone is cynical.

19:43.140 --> 19:47.561
I see you're not too happy about it.
So what? Do you want out?

19:47.644 --> 19:50.480
But that's cheating!
You can't do that to us.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.110
Or what?

19:55.194 --> 19:57.905
Are you still not over
Kang Yo-han or something?

20:08.832 --> 20:11.835
I'll deal with Kang Yo-han,

20:12.419 --> 20:15.422
so you just silence
that friend of yours, Mr. President.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.090
Who?

20:17.758 --> 20:20.260
Your biggest fan

20:20.344 --> 20:23.013
who got us into this mess
by beating that old man to death.

20:23.096 --> 20:24.681
Jukchang.

20:27.017 --> 20:31.230
Don't tell me you're still not over him.

20:39.279 --> 20:42.866
We've managed to bring them to court.
Let's expose the truth in the courtroom.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.577
We'll also need to prove
there is no virus.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.037
Will that be possible?

20:47.746 --> 20:51.291
Mr. Go has been reaching out
to one of the researchers at ERTF,

20:51.375 --> 20:53.043
and I'll be meeting with him later.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.214
Do you want to join me?

20:58.840 --> 21:00.342
Yes, why not?

21:03.011 --> 21:04.137
Hold on.

21:09.518 --> 21:10.602
Did you have dinner?

21:12.354 --> 21:13.772
I don't have the appetite.

21:16.900 --> 21:18.026
Hold on.

21:18.610 --> 21:19.736
What is it?

21:21.113 --> 21:23.073
I'm feeling a little hungry,

21:23.907 --> 21:25.826
so I'm going to cook myself some <i>ramyeon</i>.

21:28.870 --> 21:30.872
Do you want me to
throw one more in for you?

21:31.707 --> 21:32.708
Thank you.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.961
But not today. Maybe next time.

22:01.820 --> 22:02.863
Ga-on.

22:03.488 --> 22:04.573
Hey.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.369
What are you listening to?

22:11.163 --> 22:12.414
Nothing much.

22:13.498 --> 22:14.499
Just music.

22:14.583 --> 22:18.337
Listen to something brighter
so you won't keep sulking like that.

22:21.715 --> 22:24.676
Did you have dinner?

22:25.552 --> 22:27.929
I'm about to cook some <i>ramyeon</i>.

22:30.599 --> 22:31.767
You two are alike.

22:32.768 --> 22:35.228
What? What do you mean by that?

22:36.271 --> 22:37.189
Your uncle.

22:37.856 --> 22:40.901
Seriously? How am I like that old man?

22:41.568 --> 22:44.071
You're both clumsy
when it comes to comforting others.

22:44.154 --> 22:45.322
Comfort who?

22:46.114 --> 22:48.116
I just can't stand seeing you like this.

22:48.784 --> 22:50.452
It's as if you've given up on life.

22:52.454 --> 22:53.663
And it's no fun.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.335
But you know, it's actually comforting.

22:59.711 --> 23:01.254
Because you are clumsy.

23:03.965 --> 23:05.342
Thanks, Elijah.

23:06.593 --> 23:07.844
Whatever.

23:30.909 --> 23:32.577
<i>Will you marry me?</i>

23:33.578 --> 23:34.579
<i>I love you.</i>

23:35.247 --> 23:37.415
<i>Just kidding, you punk. I don't love you.</i>

23:37.499 --> 23:38.750
<i>Maybe just a little.</i>

23:41.837 --> 23:43.046
<i>Will you marry me?</i>

23:44.005 --> 23:45.215
<i>I love you.</i>

23:45.841 --> 23:47.884
<i>Just kidding, you punk. I don't love you.</i>

23:47.968 --> 23:49.511
<i>Maybe just a little.</i>

24:18.290 --> 24:21.001
<i>Well, there's lots of talk about
whether the virus has re-emerged or not.</i>

24:21.084 --> 24:22.419
<i>Why don't we just spread it?</i>

24:22.502 --> 24:24.337
So let them find it

24:25.172 --> 24:27.549
in one of the slums
at the outskirts of the city.

24:34.848 --> 24:37.017
<i>That psycho clown!</i>

24:56.453 --> 24:57.704
<i>Yes, Seon-a.</i>

24:57.787 --> 25:00.790
You know my old neighborhood, right?

25:00.874 --> 25:03.251
Is it also where
the emergency operation is in place?

25:04.044 --> 25:06.421
I guess so. Isn't it a total slum?

25:08.006 --> 25:10.342
Yes, I guess you're right.

25:12.177 --> 25:15.680
Oh, you know that youth shelter
I gave my speech at.

25:15.764 --> 25:16.598
Are they also…

25:16.681 --> 25:19.351
<i>Oh, but they're affiliated
with the Foundation.</i>

25:19.434 --> 25:20.727
I'm sure they left them out.

25:21.603 --> 25:22.938
Do you want me to check?

25:23.021 --> 25:25.523
It's okay, I was just asking.

25:27.150 --> 25:29.903
<i>I guess that's what my mom wished for me.</i>

25:29.986 --> 25:33.281
She wanted me to grow up nice
like everybody else.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.408
<i>So why did she?</i>

25:35.492 --> 25:38.662
I wonder why she beat me so

25:38.745 --> 25:41.248
whenever she was drunk?

25:41.331 --> 25:43.583
My mother was like that too.

25:44.167 --> 25:45.126
Really?

25:45.210 --> 25:47.921
She's normally an angel,

25:48.004 --> 25:50.173
but whenever she drank, she…

25:50.882 --> 25:52.342
First she'd cry, and then…

25:57.847 --> 25:59.266
<i>This is so unlike you.</i>

26:00.225 --> 26:02.394
Seon-a, have you hit menopause?

26:02.477 --> 26:04.312
<i>It's rare for you to worry about others.</i>

26:05.438 --> 26:08.358
Hey, I'm always
worried about you, you know.

26:08.441 --> 26:11.611
As if, when you have me do
all the dangerous stuff.

26:11.695 --> 26:14.698
<i>Seon-a, I know it's strictly
business between us.</i>

26:14.781 --> 26:16.866
<i>Just pay me handsomely
for my hazard allowance.</i>

26:17.826 --> 26:19.995
You rude, heartless wench.

26:20.996 --> 26:22.080
I'm hanging up.

26:36.428 --> 26:39.097
How did I end up like this?

26:45.729 --> 26:49.774
But what can I do
when I've already come so far?

27:29.230 --> 27:30.982
Thank you for coming, Dr. Yoon.

27:32.817 --> 27:34.235
Judge Kang.

27:35.445 --> 27:36.821
I'm Kim Ga-on.

27:37.947 --> 27:39.866
It's a pleasure to meet you, Judge Kim.

27:39.949 --> 27:41.618
I'll get straight to the point.

27:42.410 --> 27:44.621
Is it true that
a variant has been discovered?

27:46.915 --> 27:50.919
Honestly, I personally haven't seen
any scientific evidence.

27:53.713 --> 27:56.591
But you've been with
the Infectious Diseases Response Team.

27:57.258 --> 28:00.845
Yet are you telling me
you've seen nothing?

28:01.721 --> 28:05.975
A month ago, the Blue House suddenly
started replacing our researchers.

28:06.059 --> 28:09.312
They then classified all key data as
top secret, and kept them from us.

28:10.021 --> 28:13.149
There is an atmosphere of terror
at the TF right now.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.360
Armed soldiers are controlling everything.

28:16.277 --> 28:19.906
So you're saying you've never seen
the sample of the variant.

28:19.989 --> 28:21.324
No.

28:21.408 --> 28:24.369
I only managed to get a peek
at the victims' autopsy reports,

28:24.452 --> 28:26.079
but there were no similarities
in their symptoms.

28:26.746 --> 28:29.833
It's rare to see such a wide range
of symptoms with a single strain.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.503
But if they shared something in common…

28:36.714 --> 28:38.091
What is it?

28:39.592 --> 28:40.969
Malnutrition.

28:41.845 --> 28:43.430
Malnutrition?

28:43.513 --> 28:46.516
Most of the victims are
the homeless, the beggars and the elderly

28:46.599 --> 28:48.143
who have been neglected.

28:49.102 --> 28:51.896
And the areas
where the virus has supposedly re-emerged

28:51.980 --> 28:54.274
are all slums where the poorest live.

28:54.941 --> 28:57.318
It's not the virus that killed them,

28:57.402 --> 28:58.528
but poverty.

28:59.404 --> 29:03.783
Many have died after suffering
from chronic illnesses

29:03.867 --> 29:06.286
stemming from poor nutrition and hygiene.

29:06.369 --> 29:10.206
And they're disguising that they have died
due to a fatal virus that's circulating

29:10.290 --> 29:13.918
in certain areas to cleanse them out.
That's the truth behind this crisis.

29:17.046 --> 29:19.799
Dr. Yoon, would you be willing to testify

29:19.883 --> 29:22.469
what you just told us in court?

29:23.636 --> 29:25.054
Yes, Judge Kang.

29:25.138 --> 29:26.639
This entails danger.

29:27.265 --> 29:28.475
Are you aware of it?

29:29.893 --> 29:31.060
I'm ready.

29:34.230 --> 29:36.816
<i>Despite the Supreme Court
restricting public access to the trial,</i>

29:36.900 --> 29:39.194
<i>citing the pandemic,
many eyes are on the trial</i>

29:39.277 --> 29:42.197
<i>especially with the appointment
of the Head of Legal Affairs</i>

29:42.280 --> 29:44.199
<i>at the Emergency Response TF,</i>

29:44.282 --> 29:47.327
<i>who is also an incumbent colonel,
to defend the case.</i>

29:47.410 --> 29:51.122
<i>The development of the situation is
being watched with keen interest.</i>

29:51.206 --> 29:53.208
<i>Will the truth come to light?</i>

29:56.961 --> 29:59.339
This is a tragic accident
that was very unfortunate.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.801
Did you just say "accident," Counsel?

30:07.514 --> 30:09.849
<i>Kang Yo-han!</i>

30:09.933 --> 30:11.184
<i>Come down here.</i>

30:11.267 --> 30:14.854
<i>Come down here!
I said come down right now!</i>

30:14.938 --> 30:18.399
<i>Come down!</i>

30:18.483 --> 30:20.276
Please answer one more time.

30:20.360 --> 30:23.571
-Is this an accident, Counsel?
-Yes, it's an accident, Your Honor.

30:24.280 --> 30:27.283
Isn't it all down
to the context of the case?

30:27.367 --> 30:30.203
Then would you tell us
under what context your client murdered

30:30.286 --> 30:33.748
an elderly man in his 70s
by assaulting him with a steel pipe?

30:33.832 --> 30:37.126
Right now, the situation Korea is in
is no different to a state of war.

30:37.210 --> 30:40.338
In order to prevent
the spread of the deadly variant,

30:40.421 --> 30:44.300
our task force took to the frontline
risking their lives.

30:44.384 --> 30:48.847
This was a pure accident
that arose when the residents

30:48.930 --> 30:51.933
failed to abide by and
resisted against evacuation orders.

30:53.351 --> 30:55.144
Yes, it was merely an accident.

31:08.157 --> 31:09.659
Is this really the right way

31:09.742 --> 31:11.911
to execute official duties,
as you just claimed?

31:11.995 --> 31:14.747
I repeat. We are in a state of war.

31:15.498 --> 31:18.042
If we waste our time with
rights and procedures

31:18.126 --> 31:20.962
until the virus spreads nation-wide,

31:21.045 --> 31:22.589
who will be responsible for that?

31:23.172 --> 31:24.757
Will you, Your Honor?

31:28.720 --> 31:29.762
All right.

31:30.346 --> 31:33.308
Then let's first confirm
whether we truly are

31:33.391 --> 31:36.102
in a state of emergency
as you strongly claim.

31:36.185 --> 31:40.356
As the judge ex officio of this court,
I'll call upon a witness to check

31:40.440 --> 31:43.067
the facts on this virus variant
that has recently emerged.

31:45.361 --> 31:46.446
Please do.

31:47.822 --> 31:48.948
Mr. Yoon Myung-jin.

31:56.331 --> 31:57.916
Mr. Yoon Myung-jin?

32:03.087 --> 32:04.547
Mr. Yoon Myung-jin.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.261
Mr. Yoon Myung-jin!

32:11.179 --> 32:14.682
Perhaps you are after Dr. Yoon Myung-jin
at our Emergency Response TF,

32:14.766 --> 32:17.101
Dr. Yoon Myung-jin
at our Emergency Response TF,

32:17.185 --> 32:20.855
I regret to inform you
that he has passed away this morning.

32:22.398 --> 32:25.443
He passed away twelve hours
after he caught the variant virus

32:26.110 --> 32:28.905
while treating an infected patient.

32:31.324 --> 32:33.534
May he rest in peace.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.211
Dr. Yoon's noble sacrifice

32:43.294 --> 32:46.005
is clear evidence

32:46.089 --> 32:48.174
which is pinpointing
the current situation.

32:48.257 --> 32:50.551
Your Honor…

32:56.349 --> 33:00.603
Yes, the fun in courtroom dramas
is all about that bone-chilling

33:02.146 --> 33:06.484
and bloody twist. Just like this!

33:06.567 --> 33:07.652
Wouldn't you agree?

33:11.197 --> 33:14.450
Those bastards who killed Su-hyeon
must have killed Dr. Yoon too!

33:16.577 --> 33:18.204
Calm down, Judge Kim.

33:18.287 --> 33:20.081
Judge Kang, what are we going to do?

33:20.164 --> 33:22.709
Now that it's come to this,
I think the only way

33:22.792 --> 33:24.210
is to get Jukchang to talk.

33:25.211 --> 33:28.172
We'll have to by using whatever means.

33:30.425 --> 33:31.884
There's something I have ready.

33:33.052 --> 33:35.722
Just sit back and watch
without saying anything.

33:35.805 --> 33:36.723
Pardon?

33:43.104 --> 33:44.188
All right.

33:45.148 --> 33:48.067
So what do you suggest
is the appropriate penalty?

33:50.903 --> 33:54.240
Given how it was an accident
that occurred in an exigency,

33:54.323 --> 33:56.743
how my client still has
many years ahead of him,

33:56.826 --> 33:59.912
after all his days of struggle
without a job,

33:59.996 --> 34:03.750
and how he is deeply
remorseful of his actions,

34:03.833 --> 34:06.919
please show him your maximum leniency.

34:07.003 --> 34:08.713
What about the Prosecution?

34:15.136 --> 34:17.055
In extenuation of circumstances,

34:18.056 --> 34:20.349
the Prosecution demands
seven years' imprisonment.

34:21.642 --> 34:22.935
I see.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.397
Thank you both for your opinions.

34:28.566 --> 34:30.568
Let me now turn to the defendant.

34:30.651 --> 34:31.527
Mr. Kim.

34:32.445 --> 34:33.613
Yes, Your Honor.

34:35.990 --> 34:38.659
<i>Shine the camera on him.</i>

34:38.743 --> 34:40.411
<i>Show them the loser's face.</i>

34:40.495 --> 34:42.830
<i>Laugh all you can while you can, punk.</i>

34:42.914 --> 34:44.540
You were a member of

34:44.624 --> 34:47.877
President Heo's production crew
when he was still a celebrity, correct?

34:47.960 --> 34:49.587
You also headed his fan club.

34:52.799 --> 34:56.177
<i>Your Honor, what does that
have to do with this trial?</i>

34:56.260 --> 35:00.389
You were also an unofficial member
of his presidential campaign, right?

35:00.473 --> 35:01.933
No, I know nothing.

35:02.016 --> 35:04.769
You know nothing when this is
something that concerns you?

35:05.436 --> 35:07.563
-No.
-Interesting.

35:08.856 --> 35:11.400
You'd go around
swinging steel pipes back then too.

35:12.151 --> 35:15.613
Didn't you disrupt peaceful protests
with your comrades to exercise violence

35:15.696 --> 35:17.323
and loot shops?

35:20.284 --> 35:21.577
PUBLICATION OF FACTS OF CRIME
AND REASONS FOR NON-INDICTMENT

35:21.661 --> 35:24.455
It seems you somewhat contributed to
President Heo's election,

35:24.539 --> 35:26.457
who is a strong law and order proponent.

35:27.041 --> 35:28.042
Or am I wrong?

35:28.876 --> 35:31.712
So he wants to turn it
up a notch, does he?

35:33.548 --> 35:36.092
The old man's death was an excuse.

35:37.260 --> 35:39.679
He's trying to usurp power!

35:40.596 --> 35:43.766
Damn it, that tenacious bastard!

35:43.850 --> 35:45.810
No, and that case is already closed.

35:45.893 --> 35:48.187
-It was a reckless act after I got drunk.
-Is it?

35:48.271 --> 35:51.941
Then is it also a mere coincidence
that you happened to carry a steel pipe

35:52.024 --> 35:54.610
to the scene of the emergency relief? Or…

35:57.196 --> 35:58.781
were you under someone's orders?

35:59.532 --> 36:01.325
To drag them out, using whatever means?

36:03.327 --> 36:06.330
I wasn't under anyone's orders.
It was all under my own decision.

36:13.504 --> 36:16.549
Mr. Kim, you ran
a popular online channel in the past.

36:16.632 --> 36:18.926
-Yes.
-You rounded up your fans,

36:19.010 --> 36:21.637
who were mostly jobless youth in poverty

36:21.721 --> 36:24.724
for this rescue operation.
Whose instructions were they?

36:24.807 --> 36:26.642
I received no such instructions.

36:26.726 --> 36:31.022
I only took pity on their situations
and wanted to help them earn some money…

36:31.105 --> 36:34.650
<i>My fellow Koreans!
Who's going to build a safe Korea?</i>

36:34.734 --> 36:36.777
<i>We can't just rely on the police.</i>

36:36.861 --> 36:38.821
<i>We should be the owners of this country…</i>

36:38.905 --> 36:41.282
Ever since this particular episode
by President Heo,

36:41.365 --> 36:44.076
you rounded up jobless youth

36:44.160 --> 36:46.537
and started inflicting violence
upon foreign workers.

36:46.621 --> 36:49.957
And the same people were dispatched
for this recent operation too.

36:50.041 --> 36:52.627
Yet you deny receiving any orders?

36:56.923 --> 36:58.174
Yes.

36:58.257 --> 37:00.509
I did it out of patriotism, Your Honor.

37:00.593 --> 37:03.137
I rose up as a citizen of this country

37:03.221 --> 37:08.100
because I was highly moved
by our President's state philosophy!

37:08.184 --> 37:09.894
Is that such a sin?

37:09.977 --> 37:13.272
How is it a sin, Your Honor?

37:16.651 --> 37:20.071
So it's all your doing, is it?

37:20.154 --> 37:21.113
Yes.

37:21.197 --> 37:23.241
At your own judgment
and at your own responsibility.

37:31.207 --> 37:32.875
-Yes.
-All right.

37:34.377 --> 37:35.753
Counsel.

37:35.836 --> 37:39.423
Do you also agree with
our President's state philosophy?

37:40.967 --> 37:42.134
Of course, Your Honor.

37:42.218 --> 37:45.554
In times of crisis, we must
support our leader more than ever.

37:45.638 --> 37:47.682
We have our answer

37:47.765 --> 37:49.934
on the appropriate penalty
for our defendant.

37:50.017 --> 37:53.271
Our President has
that answer for us here already.

37:53.354 --> 37:56.023
<i>In order to see our country</i>

37:56.107 --> 37:58.776
<i>to function normally again,
as a global power,</i>

37:58.859 --> 38:01.904
<i>what do we need again? Yes, the old adage.</i>

38:03.072 --> 38:06.242
<i>Death penalty! Ta-da!</i>

38:06.325 --> 38:07.827
<i>Death penalty!</i>

38:07.910 --> 38:10.204
<i>Why should we even feed
and put a roof over</i>

38:10.288 --> 38:15.126
<i>those criminal dogs
with our taxpayer's money, anyway?</i>

38:15.209 --> 38:19.839
<i>This is all because of those hypocrites
who fuss over human rights and whatnot!</i>

38:19.922 --> 38:21.507
<i>I mean, they are murderers.</i>

38:21.590 --> 38:25.928
<i>How can you sentence just
10 or 20 years when they killed someone?</i>

38:26.012 --> 38:31.809
<i>This is absolutely impermissible,
not by my books!</i>

38:31.892 --> 38:32.810
<i>Listen up.</i>

38:33.519 --> 38:35.187
<i>A life,</i>

38:36.272 --> 38:38.232
<i>for a life.</i>

38:38.983 --> 38:40.151
<i>Did you get that?</i>

38:41.027 --> 38:45.614
<i>An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
Here's the second adage for today.</i>

38:45.698 --> 38:47.992
<i>"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."</i>

38:48.075 --> 38:52.038
<i>Oh, and those lawyers
who use emotional blackmail like,</i>

38:52.121 --> 38:54.081
<i>"He had an unfortunate childhood,"</i>

38:54.165 --> 38:57.710
<i>or "He still bears the trauma of abuse?"</i>

38:57.793 --> 38:59.712
<i>We ought to lock them all up!</i>

38:59.795 --> 39:05.760
<i>A strong law and order
makes a powerful nation!</i>

39:06.427 --> 39:09.013
Striking the enemy with his own blade…

39:09.513 --> 39:13.517
<i>-Change Korea!
-What Kang Yo-han is after is…</i>

39:15.519 --> 39:18.606
<i>Come down!</i>

39:18.689 --> 39:23.194
<i>Come down!</i>

39:23.277 --> 39:26.739
So everything is at your own judgment
and that nobody ordered you anything.

39:26.822 --> 39:29.575
If your wish is to assume
full responsibility, then go ahead.

39:30.326 --> 39:31.494
However…

39:36.791 --> 39:38.959
It will be a life for a life!

39:56.811 --> 39:58.896
As the most appropriate
penalty for this case,

39:58.979 --> 40:01.399
-I propose the death sentence.
-Your Honor!

40:01.482 --> 40:04.276
This is absurd. There is no precedence
where a death sentence

40:04.360 --> 40:06.362
was awarded for the murder of one victim.

40:07.029 --> 40:08.697
Is one not enough?

40:08.781 --> 40:12.576
Must we wait until we see
two, three, or four more victims?

40:12.660 --> 40:14.078
Is the life of the victim

40:14.161 --> 40:17.331
more valuable than the life of a murderer?

40:18.082 --> 40:20.251
But my client had
an unfortunate childhood--

40:20.334 --> 40:22.753
Enough of this emotional blackmail.

40:27.341 --> 40:30.136
Not all with
an unfortunate childhood sins.

40:31.345 --> 40:35.975
In this court,
all criminals shall be dealt with fairly.

40:36.058 --> 40:39.687
Men have dignity
because they are responsible.

40:39.770 --> 40:42.648
Cheap sympathy is nothing
but an insult to them!

40:44.942 --> 40:46.444
My fellow Koreans,

40:46.527 --> 40:49.029
just what is the rightful punishment
for a murderer?

40:50.906 --> 40:53.701
How should he pay for the blood
that his victim has spilled?

41:07.131 --> 41:14.054
CURRENT VOTES

41:14.138 --> 41:19.477
INNOCENT, GUILTY

41:40.331 --> 41:43.209
Here is our people's fervent desire
for justice.

41:43.918 --> 41:46.712
But justice shouldn't just end with words.

41:47.630 --> 41:51.258
A penalty unexecuted
is not justice, but a fraud.

41:52.092 --> 41:55.346
And I demand that justice is delivered.

42:09.693 --> 42:11.028
Electric chair…

42:17.576 --> 42:21.038
Twenty-four hours from now,
our Defendant will be executed.

42:21.121 --> 42:22.540
Right where I'm standing.

42:25.125 --> 42:26.418
I'm sorry…

42:30.256 --> 42:34.009
Please deliver justice
with your own hands.

42:34.093 --> 42:36.554
The more upvotes we receive,

42:36.637 --> 42:39.890
the higher the voltage that will run
through our condemned criminal.

42:39.974 --> 42:43.143
That means we need at least
one million votes for his death.

42:48.315 --> 42:49.858
I'll see you tomorrow in court.

42:53.904 --> 42:55.281
Your Honor…

42:58.701 --> 43:00.744
Your Honor!

43:00.828 --> 43:03.163
Excuse me. Your Honor?

43:03.914 --> 43:04.957
Your Honor!

43:15.384 --> 43:18.137
Is he trying to turn the court
into a slaughterhouse or what?

43:20.723 --> 43:22.099
What's he trying to pull here?

43:22.182 --> 43:25.394
That's what Kang Yo-han truly wants.

43:26.103 --> 43:27.146
Fear.

43:27.938 --> 43:30.524
It's also why he's given him 24 hours

43:31.317 --> 43:34.528
so that friend of yours will blow
everything out of fear.

43:34.612 --> 43:36.447
In front of the entire nation.

43:37.323 --> 43:40.284
Damn it. That brutal psycho!

43:40.367 --> 43:43.412
How can he dare
call himself a human being?

43:48.000 --> 43:50.252
So what will you do, Mr. President?

43:51.170 --> 43:54.465
You'll need to put a gag over his mouth.

43:54.548 --> 43:56.967
We need to get rid of him now
even if we have to kill him.

43:57.051 --> 43:58.260
Park Du-man!

43:58.344 --> 44:01.597
Why not just tell the whole world
that he was under our orders?

44:01.680 --> 44:02.723
Then what?

44:03.223 --> 44:04.058
I…

44:06.185 --> 44:08.937
-I'll shut him up.
-But how?

44:10.564 --> 44:13.192
I know bastards like him best.

44:13.776 --> 44:16.445
Don't worry, I'm Heo Joong-se!

44:18.364 --> 44:19.531
I'm Heo Joong-se!

44:20.824 --> 44:23.869
So just trust me. I've got this.

44:29.249 --> 44:31.543
Judge Kang, I don't think this is right.

44:31.627 --> 44:34.046
No matter how much
I think about it, this is not on.

44:38.008 --> 44:41.053
Then what do you want me to do?
Do you have any other alternatives?

44:41.720 --> 44:44.056
So you'll do anything to
get Jukchang to talk?

44:44.139 --> 44:46.934
By putting him in the electric chair
and using our people too?

44:47.017 --> 44:49.019
All I did was throw the question.

44:49.103 --> 44:50.646
It was the people who answered.

44:51.271 --> 44:54.942
You saw how the majority voted for it.
Isn't that what democracy is?

44:57.361 --> 44:59.696
Then how are you any different
from Heo Joong-se?

45:02.408 --> 45:03.867
If you still must oppose me,

45:05.077 --> 45:08.163
-I want you out of this department.
-Judge Kang!

45:10.541 --> 45:12.334
Judge Kim, say something.

45:23.846 --> 45:25.931
Judge Kim, did you see the news?

45:30.936 --> 45:34.940
<i>Justice Min Jeong-ho has just resigned
from his post as an act of protest</i>

45:35.023 --> 45:38.277
<i>against the death penalty delivered
by the people, hinted by Judge Kang.</i>

45:39.528 --> 45:43.282
<i>This isn't criminal punishment,
but an act of barbarism!</i>

45:44.032 --> 45:48.579
<i>I will leave this Supreme Court,</i>

45:50.372 --> 45:52.124
<i>violated by a mad demagogue!</i>

46:06.138 --> 46:11.393
JUSTICE MIN JEONG-HO

46:14.521 --> 46:15.522
Professor.

46:19.902 --> 46:21.153
Ga-on.

46:22.029 --> 46:23.280
You must stop him.

46:24.406 --> 46:26.492
Something like this
should not be permissible.

46:27.034 --> 46:28.744
That man, Kang Yo-han…

46:29.953 --> 46:31.205
is Satan.

46:33.624 --> 46:35.834
He's now turning
the entire nation into murders.

46:38.378 --> 46:41.882
I'm sure Judge Kang is only trying to get
Jukchang to open his mouth--

46:41.965 --> 46:43.050
So what?

46:43.842 --> 46:47.429
Is that the reason he's borrowing
the people's hands to electrocute him?

46:51.141 --> 46:52.684
Do not trust his words.

46:53.727 --> 46:57.439
That venomous man taunts
and ridicules the world

46:57.523 --> 46:59.358
by using man's weakest spots.

47:00.275 --> 47:01.235
But Professor,

47:01.902 --> 47:04.404
those with power are harming the innocent.

47:04.988 --> 47:07.115
-Su-hyeon also--
-Are you sure?

47:09.034 --> 47:11.453
-Pardon?
-I'm asking whether you're sure who it was

47:12.371 --> 47:13.705
that killed Su-hyeon.

47:14.331 --> 47:17.501
Who do you think it was that
tried to attack our department?

47:17.584 --> 47:21.880
-If you think about the situation--
-Yes, that's what I thought so at first.

47:22.381 --> 47:23.757
But you know?

47:23.840 --> 47:26.927
There was still that one detail
that continued to bug me.

47:27.010 --> 47:29.096
Su-hyeon had come to see me
a few days ago.

47:29.930 --> 47:31.014
At that time…

47:32.266 --> 47:33.600
Is there something going on?

47:46.113 --> 47:47.614
Is this about Ga-on?

47:56.123 --> 47:58.917
<i>She said she thinks you're being
deceived by Kang Yo-han.</i>

48:02.629 --> 48:04.756
Su-hyeon never liked
Kang Yo-han to start with.

48:04.840 --> 48:06.508
She didn't just dislike him.

48:08.093 --> 48:10.387
She was tracking down Kang Yo-han's past,

48:11.138 --> 48:13.056
especially on that fire at the cathedral.

48:15.642 --> 48:16.810
That fire?

48:19.146 --> 48:21.773
You know how tenacious Su-hyeon can be.

48:21.857 --> 48:24.484
Whenever she had the chance,
she'd go to that neighborhood

48:24.568 --> 48:27.404
and ask everyone
who had anything to do with the cathedral.

48:28.947 --> 48:30.449
Except for one.

48:31.742 --> 48:34.286
She just couldn't get a hold
of a man called Joseph.

48:35.287 --> 48:37.664
It was as if someone had
sneaked him out on purpose.

48:39.833 --> 48:41.168
Who is this Joseph?

48:41.251 --> 48:45.297
He's someone who boarded at the cathedral,
doing all kinds of odd jobs in exchange.

48:45.380 --> 48:47.257
And his chores included

48:48.550 --> 48:50.719
maintaining the surveillance cameras.

48:52.804 --> 48:54.848
Su-hyeon had been after him.

48:56.725 --> 48:57.934
So what if…

48:58.018 --> 49:01.104
Su-hyeon had finally tracked him down

49:01.688 --> 49:03.899
and Kang Yo-han had found out about it?

49:09.363 --> 49:11.573
But these are all just assumptions.

49:11.657 --> 49:13.992
Are you implying Kang Yo-han
killed his own brother?

49:14.076 --> 49:16.370
Do you know
what pain he's suffered because of it?

49:16.453 --> 49:17.579
That's…

49:18.830 --> 49:21.875
That's horrendous pain
you can't just invent.

49:21.958 --> 49:23.043
What if his pain…

49:24.586 --> 49:26.046
stemmed from guilt?

49:28.382 --> 49:31.551
What if that was why
he's so eager to hide his past?

49:31.635 --> 49:35.555
And what if that was what
Su-hyeon had been digging into?

49:41.436 --> 49:42.479
That's enough.

49:47.192 --> 49:48.318
I'll be leaving now.

49:51.488 --> 49:52.948
Let me ask you something.

49:56.910 --> 49:58.620
If Su-hyeon were to see you

49:59.830 --> 50:02.290
next to Kang Yo-han,

50:05.127 --> 50:06.545
electrocuting someone to death…

50:08.797 --> 50:10.215
what do you think she'd say?

50:39.244 --> 50:42.873
But that doesn't mean a judge is allowed
to do crazy things like Kang Yo-han.

50:42.956 --> 50:45.584
What you heard and saw were odd enough.

50:46.543 --> 50:48.086
And cheating is cheating.

50:48.962 --> 50:50.297
That's a crime too.

50:50.380 --> 50:52.174
And don't you be deluded.

50:52.257 --> 50:53.592
Deluded?

50:53.675 --> 50:56.136
Whether Kang Yo-han has a reason or not,

50:57.012 --> 50:58.847
that still doesn't change anything.

50:58.930 --> 51:00.599
Who out there doesn't have
a story to tell?

51:00.682 --> 51:04.186
And it's not like everyone
breaks the law, is it?

51:19.576 --> 51:21.203
<i>If Su-hyeon were to see you</i>

51:21.286 --> 51:24.164
<i>next to Kang Yo-han,</i>

51:24.247 --> 51:25.916
electrocuting someone to death…

51:27.959 --> 51:29.628
what do you think she'd say?

51:45.310 --> 51:46.812
Ga-on, what are you doing?

51:48.647 --> 51:49.689
Why are you here?

51:49.773 --> 51:51.900
-Su-hyeon.
-Tell me. Why are you here?

51:54.986 --> 51:57.072
Do you know what I did because of you?

51:58.406 --> 52:00.367
I destroyed evidence. Me!

52:02.118 --> 52:06.540
How could you…
how could you have me see that?

52:33.733 --> 52:35.026
<i>What do I do?</i>

52:35.110 --> 52:36.695
What do I do?

52:38.113 --> 52:39.948
I didn't know I'd die like this…

52:42.284 --> 52:44.995
No… I'm sure he'll save me.

52:46.079 --> 52:48.039
He dotes on me so.

52:52.127 --> 52:54.421
I'm sure
he won't leave me to die like this.

52:56.339 --> 52:57.674
No, not like this…

53:00.343 --> 53:02.470
What the…

53:02.554 --> 53:03.680
Let go!

53:32.208 --> 53:33.293
Mr. President.

53:37.839 --> 53:43.136
<i>BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL</i>

53:54.439 --> 53:56.066
Will you really proceed with it?

53:59.444 --> 54:00.779
Is there a reason to stop?

54:00.862 --> 54:03.031
It's the villains who are the sinners,

54:03.114 --> 54:05.533
so why punish the innocent citizens?

54:06.368 --> 54:07.494
Punish?

54:07.577 --> 54:10.538
Is it not punishment
when you're making them kill someone

54:11.206 --> 54:12.999
with their own hands in broad daylight?

54:13.833 --> 54:16.044
Then is it okay as long as we borrow
someone else's hands to kill?

54:19.464 --> 54:23.885
I don't believe in those who just sit back
blabbering cheap talk about justice.

54:25.011 --> 54:27.055
Asking others to fight evil
on their behalf

54:27.138 --> 54:29.265
so they don't dirty their hands
with blood?

54:29.349 --> 54:30.725
They're no more than an accomplice.

54:32.227 --> 54:35.689
There is no man in this world
who is free of sin.

54:35.772 --> 54:37.232
No, you're wrong.

54:38.233 --> 54:41.569
There are many more people
who may not be able to rise up and fight,

54:41.653 --> 54:43.738
but who live earnestly
without harming others.

54:43.822 --> 54:46.574
And that's why others risk
their lives to protect this world

54:47.993 --> 54:49.661
like Dr. Yoon Myung-jin.

54:49.744 --> 54:51.329
And…

54:54.290 --> 54:55.834
the police officers like Su-hyeon.

55:00.463 --> 55:03.591
A world where everyone must taint
their hands with blood is hell.

55:04.342 --> 55:06.970
And you're trying to turn
this world into hell, Judge Kang.

55:08.430 --> 55:11.349
The world I was born into
has always been hell.

55:12.017 --> 55:13.768
Will you please stop here?

55:13.852 --> 55:18.440
I don't want to see you
cross the point of no return, Judge Kang.

55:20.025 --> 55:21.192
I have

55:22.902 --> 55:24.529
no other option.

55:35.248 --> 55:36.833
May I ask you something?

55:37.876 --> 55:38.835
What?

55:38.918 --> 55:41.046
When we took to the scene
of the forced migration,

55:41.129 --> 55:44.758
you knew the collision between them
may result in deaths.

55:46.176 --> 55:47.427
Didn't you?

55:50.889 --> 55:54.225
Your neighbors are dying,
even as we speak.

55:54.309 --> 55:55.477
Will you continue to
just sit back and watch?

56:00.315 --> 56:02.942
-Judge Kang!
-They just stoned Judge Kang.

56:05.028 --> 56:06.237
Judge Kang!

56:06.321 --> 56:07.864
You ought to go to hell!

56:14.079 --> 56:16.539
Kang Yo-han!

56:20.835 --> 56:21.920
Come down here!

56:22.003 --> 56:27.717
Come down here!
I said come down right now!

56:34.557 --> 56:37.060
<i>Is that what you'd actually
planned from the start?</i>

56:38.645 --> 56:40.647
<i>Because to get people to fight,</i>

56:42.607 --> 56:44.609
you needed the blood of a sacrifice.

56:58.248 --> 57:00.125
Is it really true, then?

57:02.752 --> 57:04.671
If you have time to ask questions,

57:05.672 --> 57:06.965
just get to work.

58:44.729 --> 58:48.233
NATIONAL VOTE ON
KIM CHOONG-SIK'S EXECUTION

59:07.877 --> 59:09.087
It's finally time.

59:10.213 --> 59:11.339
Please get ready.

59:21.182 --> 59:24.102
Will you really assume
full responsibility?

59:25.478 --> 59:27.564
Are you sure you weren't
under anyone's orders?

59:27.647 --> 59:29.524
Yes, so why do you keep on asking me,

59:30.692 --> 59:32.235
you demon.

59:34.153 --> 59:35.238
All right.

59:35.321 --> 59:38.866
My fellow Koreans,
we now await your judgment.

59:51.004 --> 59:54.007
NO. OF PARTICIPANTS

1:00:08.563 --> 1:00:11.065
You think this is fun, do you?

1:00:50.980 --> 1:00:54.150
I'm not going to die. Why would I?

1:00:57.904 --> 1:00:59.739
I've done nothing wrong.

1:01:00.448 --> 1:01:03.618
I can't believe you're going through this
when you're a true patriot.

1:01:04.994 --> 1:01:07.080
Honestly, you've gone to so much trouble.

1:01:07.163 --> 1:01:08.498
Here, have a seat.

1:01:16.089 --> 1:01:19.550
Hey, why are you crying when you're a man?

1:01:20.134 --> 1:01:23.137
Did you really think I'd abandon you?
But I'm Heo Joong-se!

1:01:23.221 --> 1:01:26.933
No, sir. I had my full faith in you.

1:01:27.016 --> 1:01:29.977
Yes, all you need to do is just trust me.

1:01:32.814 --> 1:01:35.191
So why not trust me till the end?

1:01:35.817 --> 1:01:39.404
I need you to sit in that chair
for me tomorrow.

1:01:39.487 --> 1:01:40.363
Pardon?

1:01:40.446 --> 1:01:43.366
Kang Yo-han is just putting on a show.
That's what he's doing!

1:01:43.449 --> 1:01:46.994
A blackmail show
until you blurt out my name!

1:01:47.620 --> 1:01:50.331
But how can you tell me to die?

1:01:50.915 --> 1:01:52.834
Come on, don't be a chicken!

1:01:52.917 --> 1:01:55.670
You just need to hang in there.

1:01:55.753 --> 1:01:59.632
But if it looks like things
might just get dangerous,

1:01:59.716 --> 1:02:01.467
I'll put a stop to it.

1:02:01.551 --> 1:02:04.554
I'll save you even if it means
cutting all the power off!

1:02:04.637 --> 1:02:06.013
So don't you worry, all right?

1:02:08.391 --> 1:02:10.435
This is all for our country!

1:02:10.518 --> 1:02:11.769
Your lifelong wish…

1:02:11.853 --> 1:02:14.230
Remember?
I've told you over and over again.

1:02:14.313 --> 1:02:16.941
That I'll make it happen.

1:02:17.525 --> 1:02:20.945
-Really, Mr. President?
-Your lifelong wish…

1:02:22.655 --> 1:02:24.198
An apartment with a view of the Han River,

1:02:25.908 --> 1:02:30.747
a regular job at a public enterprise,
and I'll throw in plenty of Bitcoins too!

1:02:32.999 --> 1:02:34.000
Mr. President…

1:02:34.083 --> 1:02:35.251
Thank you.

1:02:35.877 --> 1:02:37.170
That's right, you punk!

1:02:37.253 --> 1:02:38.796
You brave little punk!

1:02:48.306 --> 1:02:50.099
Who do you think you are to kill me?

1:02:53.478 --> 1:02:54.687
Go on and try.

1:03:15.625 --> 1:03:16.876
My fellow Koreans!

1:03:18.127 --> 1:03:20.046
You are the owners of this nation.

1:03:20.630 --> 1:03:23.549
<i>Owners are those who are responsible.</i>

1:03:23.633 --> 1:03:27.053
<i>In fact, they are owners because
they are responsible for themselves.</i>

1:03:27.678 --> 1:03:31.766
So please be the owners of our country.

1:03:35.186 --> 1:03:37.355
"Please be the owners…"

1:03:40.149 --> 1:03:42.527
You make me laugh.

1:03:46.781 --> 1:03:48.699
Will you just let him be, then?

1:03:48.783 --> 1:03:51.786
Still, it's just so horrible.

1:03:52.453 --> 1:03:55.081
How can I kill someone with my own hands?

1:03:55.164 --> 1:03:58.042
There's no guarantee
he won't kill someone else again.

1:03:58.125 --> 1:04:00.837
Besides, he's been up to all kinds
of trouble since a long time ago.

1:04:01.796 --> 1:04:03.089
We should vote.

1:04:03.172 --> 1:04:04.715
Let's all vote.

1:04:04.799 --> 1:04:06.676
-Let's all do it.
-Shall we?

1:04:16.602 --> 1:04:19.856
Wow, they're really coming through.

1:04:23.943 --> 1:04:26.153
WHAT IS YOUR DECISION?

1:04:26.237 --> 1:04:27.822
Hey, it's really legit.

1:04:27.905 --> 1:04:30.741
Is it? That number just went up
because you pressed it, right?

1:04:30.825 --> 1:04:33.327
Yes. I doubted it, but it really is legit!

1:04:33.411 --> 1:04:36.205
Is it? Then shall I try it too?

1:04:37.331 --> 1:04:38.749
That damned bastard…

1:04:38.833 --> 1:04:41.168
Right, the law is law.

1:04:42.753 --> 1:04:44.297
It's right that we vote.

1:04:45.965 --> 1:04:47.758
Hey, but this really does work.

1:04:49.427 --> 1:04:50.553
Who knew?

1:04:50.636 --> 1:04:52.763
NO. OF PARTICIPANTS

1:04:55.391 --> 1:04:56.726
It's bearable.

1:04:59.020 --> 1:05:00.104
It's okay.

1:05:02.523 --> 1:05:03.941
He told me to hang in there.

1:05:23.169 --> 1:05:26.297
-Press it!
-Oh wow.

1:05:26.380 --> 1:05:30.259
I need to hang in there.

1:05:32.428 --> 1:05:34.472
Wow, he's about to die.

1:05:55.534 --> 1:05:56.702
Electric shock!

1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:05.711
-Press it!
-No, stop!

1:06:23.354 --> 1:06:25.064
He told me to hang in there.

1:06:44.250 --> 1:06:46.544
WHAT IS YOUR DECISION?

1:07:10.151 --> 1:07:11.402
Judge Kang.

1:07:12.278 --> 1:07:15.322
The Ministry of Justice
has just ordered a stay of execution.

1:07:16.240 --> 1:07:17.533
On whose orders?

1:07:17.616 --> 1:07:20.828
Judge Kim Ga-on
held a press conference just now.

1:07:30.004 --> 1:07:31.047
<i>All trials</i>

1:07:32.506 --> 1:07:33.799
<i>of the </i>Live Court Show

1:07:35.092 --> 1:07:36.385
<i>were manipulated.</i>

1:08:41.909 --> 1:08:43.911
<i>I am a sinner.</i>

1:08:43.994 --> 1:08:45.204
<i>Are you scared of me?</i>

1:08:46.080 --> 1:08:48.124
Don't you want to become
a monster like me?

1:08:48.207 --> 1:08:51.544
You're just a clown
that I took as my puppet.

1:08:51.627 --> 1:08:53.504
Kang Yo-han for President!

1:08:53.587 --> 1:08:56.257
-What are we going to do about this?
-Isn't he lucky?

1:08:56.340 --> 1:08:57.925
<i>This is Su-hyeon's keepsake.</i>

1:08:58.008 --> 1:09:00.261
<i>Now it's time for her
to learn the truth too.</i>

1:09:00.344 --> 1:09:02.179
<i>I saw it with my own eyes.</i>

1:09:02.263 --> 1:09:04.014
Did you meet Joseph?

1:09:04.098 --> 1:09:07.101
<i>This is what the Young Master
tried desperately to hide.</i>

1:09:08.060 --> 1:09:09.603
<i>But you'll regret it.</i>

1:09:10.396 --> 1:09:11.564
For life.

1:09:11.647 --> 1:09:13.691
<i>Now you look a little lonely.</i>

1:09:14.400 --> 1:09:18.988
