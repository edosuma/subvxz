_

01:08.469 --> 01:11.237
Making the hippo lanes
after a big rainstorm

01:11.272 --> 01:14.671
has been a hippo tradition
for a long time.

01:14.706 --> 01:17.376
It sure would be easy to
get lost in all these reeds.

01:17.412 --> 01:19.145
Exactly.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.213
Flattening all
these overgrown plants

01:21.249 --> 01:24.083
helps everyone else cross
the flood plains safely.

01:24.118 --> 01:27.053
So I try to make 'em
straight and true.

01:27.088 --> 01:30.256
And that's what they are,
straight and true.

01:30.291 --> 01:35.261
I do my best. And someday you'll
be the one making the hippo lanes!

01:35.296 --> 01:39.198
Help! Help! I'm stuck!

01:39.233 --> 01:41.000
It came from back this way!

01:41.035 --> 01:42.001
Let's go, son!

01:45.273 --> 01:47.273
Somebody! Anybody?

01:48.476 --> 01:50.342
<i> Twende Kiboko!</i>

01:51.145 --> 01:52.111
Help!

01:52.447 --> 01:55.114
- Where are you?
- Over here!

01:59.053 --> 02:02.188
Mmm. Lunchtime.

02:02.223 --> 02:03.255
We're coming!

02:03.291 --> 02:05.991
They'll never find
him in this mess.

02:07.061 --> 02:08.094
This way, Dad!

02:09.997 --> 02:12.364
- Hey!
- Stay away from him, Makuu!

02:12.400 --> 02:13.999
Makuu?

02:14.035 --> 02:16.068
Think about it, Beshte.

02:16.104 --> 02:19.238
There's two of us,
and only one of you.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.973
Back off, Makuu.

02:21.008 --> 02:23.342
The flood plains are a
safe zone after a rainstorm.

02:25.179 --> 02:28.013
You know Beshte's right, Makuu.

02:28.049 --> 02:31.217
Hippos...
always obeying the rules.

02:31.252 --> 02:34.386
Come on. One little rhino's
not worth the effort.

02:37.258 --> 02:41.460
- You sure they're gone?
- Yup. So what's the kerbubble?

02:41.496 --> 02:44.230
I got tangled up
in the reeds and mud.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.298
And I can't get free.

02:46.334 --> 02:49.468
Well, maybe you should have waited
for me to finish the hippo lanes.

02:49.504 --> 02:51.437
Just like all the other animals.

02:51.472 --> 02:53.139
But I was in a hurry!

02:54.275 --> 02:58.110
I know.
I should have waited.

02:58.146 --> 02:59.979
Don't worry.
We'll get you out.

03:04.352 --> 03:06.152
What was that?

03:10.992 --> 03:12.024
There you go!

03:12.059 --> 03:15.127
I'm free!
Oh, oh, thank you!

03:15.163 --> 03:17.129
- Don't forget...
- I know!

03:17.165 --> 03:20.132
Wait to cross until
the hippo lanes are done.

03:20.168 --> 03:22.401
That's right.
Won't be long now.

03:22.436 --> 03:25.271
- Hey, Beshte!
- Kion!

03:25.306 --> 03:27.273
We heard an animal
shouting for help.

03:27.308 --> 03:31.143
Yeah. But it's taking us forever
to get through all this muck.

03:31.179 --> 03:32.444
Don't worry about that.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.980
Me and my dad saved
the little guy.

03:35.016 --> 03:36.115
And scared off Makuu.

03:36.150 --> 03:39.084
You and your dad did all that?

03:39.120 --> 03:41.453
Maybe Basi should be on
the Lion Guard too, Kion.

03:41.489 --> 03:44.390
I don't think so.

03:44.425 --> 03:47.226
I've got my jaws full
making the hippo lanes.

03:47.261 --> 03:50.229
And speaking of the hippo
lanes, I need to get back to it!

03:52.066 --> 03:55.186
- Whoa! You okay, Dad?
- I'll be fine, Beshte.

03:55.221 --> 03:57.469
That little rhino just
scratched me with his horn.

04:00.308 --> 04:03.175
Dad? Looks like more
than just a scratch.

04:03.211 --> 04:06.378
Basi, you probably shouldn't
be walking on that leg.

04:06.414 --> 04:08.948
I'm afraid
the hippo lanes can't wait.

04:10.117 --> 04:12.318
Dad, there's no way
you can make the hippo lanes

04:12.353 --> 04:14.253
if you're having trouble
just walking.

04:14.288 --> 04:16.988
I'm afraid you're right.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.024
So? What's the big deal?

04:19.060 --> 04:20.358
The flood plains
will dry up soon.

04:20.394 --> 04:23.195
There's not a cloud in the sky.

04:27.468 --> 04:30.269
Oh.
You know what they say.

04:30.304 --> 04:32.238
If you don't like
the weather on the savannah,

04:32.273 --> 04:34.106
just wait a few breaths.

04:34.141 --> 04:37.376
Beshte? It looks
like someday is today.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.144
What do you mean?

04:39.180 --> 04:42.348
I've always said you'd take
over the hippo lanes someday.

04:42.383 --> 04:45.184
But today? Right now?

04:45.219 --> 04:47.353
Dad, I don't know
if I can do it.

04:47.388 --> 04:50.289
The Pride Lands need
those hippo lanes, son.

04:50.324 --> 04:52.258
And I know you can do it.

04:52.293 --> 04:55.261
Beshte, you're the
strongest in the Pride Lands.

04:55.296 --> 04:56.996
We all believe in you.

04:57.031 --> 05:01.000
Right. It's my responsibility
as a hippo.

05:01.035 --> 05:02.368
I'll do it.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.169
- That's great.
- All right!

05:04.205 --> 05:06.071
That's my boy.

05:06.107 --> 05:07.406
And I can help!

05:09.977 --> 05:13.145
- It's really stuck in there.
- Come on, Bunga.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.347
Something tells me
we'd only slow Beshte down.

05:15.383 --> 05:18.384
And you know I'm never
one to slow anyone down!

05:18.419 --> 05:20.185
Thanks, guys.

05:20.221 --> 05:22.988
We'll help your dad get back
to solid ground so he can rest.

05:23.024 --> 05:25.090
Sounds good to me.

05:28.329 --> 05:30.362
My first time
making the hippo lanes.

05:30.398 --> 05:32.064
What a big day!

05:34.168 --> 05:36.168
Thank you, Lion Guard.

05:36.203 --> 05:38.370
I'm sure if I stay off it,
it'll heal up quick.

05:38.406 --> 05:39.438
Happy to help.

05:39.473 --> 05:42.207
Everyone! Everyone!
We've got a problem.

05:42.243 --> 05:44.977
There's another
rainstorm on the way!

05:45.012 --> 05:46.011
We heard.

05:46.047 --> 05:47.212
It is the rainy season, Ono.

05:47.248 --> 05:50.149
Yes. But the sable antelopes'
grazing grounds

05:50.184 --> 05:53.252
were already flooded out
in yesterday's rainstorm.

05:53.287 --> 05:56.322
So they've got nowhere to eat?
That's horrible!

05:56.357 --> 05:59.158
And if I know the sable antelope,

05:59.193 --> 06:01.260
they're probably
too stubborn to move.

06:01.295 --> 06:04.396
Exactly! They're just standing
around in knee-deep water!

06:04.432 --> 06:06.999
Even the little
baby antelopes!

06:07.034 --> 06:08.934
So when the next
rain storm comes...

06:08.969 --> 06:11.136
They'll be completely
underwater.

06:11.172 --> 06:13.105
We need to get that herd
to higher ground.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.340
You should bring them here.

06:14.375 --> 06:17.376
The herd's on the other side
of the flood plains.

06:17.411 --> 06:21.246
Well, sure. But by the time you
go around and lead them back,

06:21.282 --> 06:23.315
Beshte will be done
with the hippo lanes.

06:23.351 --> 06:27.186
Right. Then they can get
across the flood plains quickly.

06:27.221 --> 06:28.354
Before the rain gets here.

06:28.389 --> 06:31.190
Great idea, Basi.
Thanks for your help!

06:31.225 --> 06:34.360
Sure. Just wish I could be out
helping Beshte with those lanes.

06:34.395 --> 06:36.261
Don't worry, Bigger B.

06:36.297 --> 06:38.263
I know Big B
can handle it.

06:38.299 --> 06:41.266
Come on, Lion Guard.
Let's go help those antelope!

06:41.302 --> 06:43.168
Till the Pride Lands end...

06:43.204 --> 06:45.304
<i>Lion Guard defend!</i>

06:50.344 --> 06:51.377
Hi, Beshte!

06:51.412 --> 06:52.444
Hey, Laini.

06:52.480 --> 06:55.347
Check it!
I'm makin' the hippo lanes!

06:55.383 --> 06:59.151
Oh, good! I've been trying to get
across the flood plains all day!

06:59.186 --> 07:01.920
Think I could hitch a ride
to Ndefu Grove?

07:01.956 --> 07:05.190
Sure! Helpin' other animals is
the whole point of the hippo lanes!

07:05.226 --> 07:07.226
Aw! Thanks, Beshte.

07:07.261 --> 07:11.362
<i>- Any time, Laini.
- # La, la, la, la, la #</i>

07:13.434 --> 07:14.933
This way!

07:18.272 --> 07:22.040
Antelopes, listen up! You
need to follow us to higher...

07:22.076 --> 07:24.343
- And drier!
- ...ground. Let's go!

07:24.378 --> 07:27.980
"Let's go?"
Maybe we don't want to go.

07:28.015 --> 07:30.182
Maybe we're fine right here.

07:30.217 --> 07:33.185
Fine?
You're knee deep in water.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.154
You really need to come with us.

07:35.189 --> 07:36.355
Do we now?

07:36.390 --> 07:38.223
There's another rainstorm
on the way.

07:38.259 --> 07:40.292
The water here
will only get higher!

07:40.327 --> 07:42.941
So follow us. Come on!

07:43.464 --> 07:46.064
We don't take orders from you.

07:47.268 --> 07:49.301
I know you're
tired and hungry.

07:49.336 --> 07:52.070
But if you follow us
to higher ground,

07:52.106 --> 07:53.372
there'll be plenty to eat.

07:55.309 --> 07:58.010
And you won't
be standing around in water.

07:58.045 --> 08:02.047
It might be nice to get the
young ones out of the water, Bupu.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.951
Okay.

08:05.986 --> 08:09.759
You heard Kion.
Let's follow the Lion Guard!

08:10.291 --> 08:12.157
Was that so hard?

08:12.193 --> 08:15.133
Let's go anty-lanty-lope!

08:17.298 --> 08:20.232
- Ono, report.
- So far so good, Kion.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.301
Wait a tick...

08:22.336 --> 08:26.305
- Rock slide!
- Back! Everyone back!

08:26.340 --> 08:28.106
What is it with you?

08:28.142 --> 08:30.042
You just told us to follow you.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.179
Anyone hurt?

08:34.215 --> 08:35.380
- Nope.
- Fine.

08:35.416 --> 08:37.416
- Ono, how's the herd?
- They look fine.

08:37.451 --> 08:40.352
But there's no way
they can get past those rocks.

08:40.386 --> 08:42.321
Is there another way around?

08:42.356 --> 08:45.123
I don't see one.

08:45.159 --> 08:47.326
And it looks like
the storm's coming in fast!

08:47.361 --> 08:50.095
Too bad Beshte's not here.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.097
He could move
those boulders easy.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.198
We don't need Beshte.

08:53.234 --> 08:57.202
Kion can just Roar that
rock away. Right, Kion?

08:57.238 --> 09:00.239
I could, if the antelopes
weren't on the other side of it.

09:00.274 --> 09:02.174
Oh, yeah.

09:02.209 --> 09:06.078
But I can use the Roar
from that side of the rock!

09:06.113 --> 09:07.079
Come on!

09:16.090 --> 09:17.956
Excellent work, Beshte.

09:17.992 --> 09:20.225
I didn't think he was
going to make that one.

09:20.261 --> 09:21.994
What are you talking about?

09:22.029 --> 09:24.263
He's Beshte!
Strongest in the Pride Lands.

09:24.298 --> 09:28.150
I suppose. But I was afraid
we were going to get stuck.

09:28.269 --> 09:31.403
Nah. Don't listen to her.
You're doing a dandy job.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.338
Heh-heh. Thanks, Chura.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.944
Except I was headed that way.

09:38.979 --> 09:41.246
No problem.
I'll get you there in a jiffy.

09:43.417 --> 09:46.285
Oh. Then can you drop me off
over by Ndefu Grove?

09:46.320 --> 09:47.419
Sure thing, Laini.

09:47.454 --> 09:50.222
- You sure you don't mind?
- 'Course he doesn't mind!

09:50.257 --> 09:52.291
It's no problem for the
strongest in the Pride Lands.

09:52.326 --> 09:55.160
Aw. The whole point
of the hippo lanes

09:55.216 --> 09:57.216
is to help animals get where
they need to go.

11:40.501 --> 11:44.136
- Thanks for the ride, Beshte.
- Any time, Chura.

11:44.171 --> 11:47.472
Oh! My den's not far from here.
I'll get off, too. You mind?

11:47.508 --> 11:49.041
Thanks again.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.010
My pleasure.
But I better get goin' and

11:51.310 --> 11:53.245
make another lane
back to the other side.

11:53.280 --> 11:56.481
You're going to
the other side? Perfect!

11:56.517 --> 11:59.451
Just drop me off at the patch of
bristle grass on the other side.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.053
Sure thing.

12:01.088 --> 12:02.954
Good thing
you came along, Beshte,

12:02.990 --> 12:05.157
or I never would've gotten
across the flood plains.

12:07.094 --> 12:09.194
Come on, everybody.
Up. Up!

12:09.229 --> 12:10.362
What's the point?

12:10.397 --> 12:14.399
The path is blocked.
We're tired. We give up!

12:14.435 --> 12:17.369
- Seriously?
- Eh, Kion's got this.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.304
Hang on to your antlers.

12:19.339 --> 12:23.241
Uh, for one thing, they're
horns. And for another...

12:31.218 --> 12:33.385
Come on. Let's get you
to the flood plains.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.986
This way.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.629
Uh, guys?

12:40.427 --> 12:43.195
Hello?
The path is clear!

12:44.331 --> 12:47.032
We've already come so far.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.335
Seriously?

12:50.370 --> 12:53.105
I suppose we could follow
a little longer.

12:53.140 --> 12:55.006
Un-Bunga-lievable.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.211
I just hope we beat that storm.

13:03.050 --> 13:04.349
Almost there.

13:04.384 --> 13:07.978
We just have to take the hippo
lanes across the flood plains.

13:08.222 --> 13:10.222
Huh? This can't be right.

13:10.257 --> 13:12.055
I better talk to Beshte.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.327
There he is.

13:15.362 --> 13:18.163
- Hey, Ono!
- Beshte? Um...

13:18.198 --> 13:23.305
- So, are you all done with the hippo lanes?
- Sure am. Whew.

13:23.340 --> 13:26.338
I must've gone back and forth
I don't know how many times!

13:26.373 --> 13:29.341
But I got to talk to a lot
of nice animals along the way.

13:29.376 --> 13:33.311
I'm sure you did. And I know
you've been working hard. But, uh...

13:33.347 --> 13:35.981
- But what?
- Well...

13:36.016 --> 13:37.449
Why don't you take
a look for yourself?

13:37.484 --> 13:40.118
I didn't think of that.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.454
Oh, no, Ono!

13:42.489 --> 13:46.124
I must've gotten distracted
by all the rides I was giving.

13:46.160 --> 13:48.260
Those lanes aren't
straight and true at all!

13:49.196 --> 13:50.362
I let everybody down.

13:50.397 --> 13:53.298
Well, at least
they're kind of pretty.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.367
That one kind of
looks like a flamingo.

13:55.402 --> 13:57.002
Yeah.

13:57.037 --> 14:00.005
Wait. But hippo lanes aren't
supposed to be pretty.

14:00.040 --> 14:03.108
Hippos lanes should be
straight and true.

14:03.143 --> 14:06.074
- And useful!
- I know. That's why we just

14:06.109 --> 14:08.246
led a whole herd of
sable antelopes to them.

14:08.282 --> 14:10.081
A whole herd?

14:10.117 --> 14:13.351
If they go into the flood plains
now, they'll get totally lost!

14:14.288 --> 14:15.387
I gotta make a new lane.

14:15.422 --> 14:18.390
But what if I mess it up again?

14:18.425 --> 14:22.123
- No! I can do this.
- Uh, Beshte?

14:23.030 --> 14:25.263
Ah! I did it again!

14:25.299 --> 14:28.166
Dad's going to be so disappointed.

14:28.202 --> 14:30.435
Wait. Dad'll know
how to fix this!

14:30.470 --> 14:32.103
I gotta go talk to him.

14:32.139 --> 14:34.339
Ono, go warn Kion.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.108
Don't let any animals
into the lanes yet.

14:37.144 --> 14:38.310
Affirmative!

14:40.347 --> 14:43.248
This way. This way.
Step right up.

14:43.283 --> 14:48.119
One new Beshte-made hippo lane
for all your crossing pleasures!

14:48.155 --> 14:49.354
Moms and babies first!

14:57.130 --> 14:58.396
Okay. Now you.

14:58.432 --> 14:59.431
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:59.466 --> 15:01.099
Everyone! Wait!

15:01.134 --> 15:02.968
Don't go in the hippo lanes!

15:03.403 --> 15:05.203
Ono? What's going on?

15:05.239 --> 15:07.939
The lanes! They're not
exactly straight and true.

15:07.975 --> 15:10.242
More like
a curly elephant's trunk.

15:10.277 --> 15:12.277
Actually, they're more like
a bunch of elephants' trunks.

15:12.312 --> 15:13.979
All twisted up together.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.114
And stuck in
a Baobab tree's roots.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.183
But I just let an antelope
and her baby go in!

15:18.218 --> 15:19.985
<i> Hapana!</i>

15:20.020 --> 15:21.186
They'll get lost in there!

15:21.221 --> 15:22.387
Not if we can help it.

15:22.422 --> 15:25.090
Bunga, Fuli,
you two stay here.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.092
Don't let anyone else in.

15:27.127 --> 15:28.293
Ono, you're with me.

15:30.063 --> 15:32.998
Right behind...
Uh, above you, Kion.

15:35.068 --> 15:38.236
So we're not going in now?

15:38.272 --> 15:41.139
All day they've
been telling us what to do.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.375
"Get out of the water
so you won't drown."

15:43.410 --> 15:46.344
"Follow us to higher ground
so you won't starve."

15:46.380 --> 15:48.446
"Don't get hit
by falling rocks."

15:48.482 --> 15:50.115
I don't know about you,

15:50.150 --> 15:52.450
but I'm sick and tired
of being told what to do!

15:52.486 --> 15:54.152
Are you serious?

15:54.187 --> 15:55.453
Those were all good things!

15:59.493 --> 16:02.394
Now I bet you're going to
tell us to get out of the rain.

16:02.429 --> 16:05.196
Well, we're not going anywhere!

16:05.232 --> 16:06.231
Good.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.166
Yeah.
That's kinda what we wanted.

16:08.201 --> 16:11.136
So, now the herd
is waiting on the other side.

16:11.171 --> 16:13.071
I let everyone down.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.205
Especially you.

16:14.241 --> 16:17.075
You didn't let anyone down,
Beshte.

16:17.110 --> 16:19.077
If anything,
I let you down.

16:19.112 --> 16:22.347
I never should have sent you
out there alone, son.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.283
Dad, your leg!

16:27.054 --> 16:30.956
Son, you're the strongest
hippo in the Pride Lands.

16:30.991 --> 16:33.959
Look. If you'll help me,
I'll help you.

16:33.994 --> 16:35.193
Of course I'll help!

16:35.228 --> 16:36.995
All right.

16:37.030 --> 16:39.965
Then together we can make a lane
straight enough, true enough,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.400
and wide enough to get
that whole herd through.

16:42.436 --> 16:43.435
<i> Poa!</i>

16:46.306 --> 16:48.273
I found him.
Right ahead, Kion!

16:48.308 --> 16:49.374
And he needs help!

16:56.483 --> 16:58.183
You okay?

16:58.218 --> 17:00.185
Now where's your mom?

17:00.220 --> 17:03.355
She was right behind me!

17:03.390 --> 17:06.925
Help!
Somebody help!

17:06.960 --> 17:07.959
I'll go look for her.

17:07.994 --> 17:10.028
No, Ono!
Stay with this little guy.

17:10.063 --> 17:11.096
Guide him back to safety.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.196
You got it.

17:12.232 --> 17:13.298
Don't worry.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.933
I'll find your mom.

17:16.002 --> 17:17.301
And I'll help you
find your way out.

17:17.337 --> 17:18.336
Follow me.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.271
Help, please!

17:21.308 --> 17:22.307
I'm on my way!

17:24.344 --> 17:26.144
Dad, you okay?

17:26.179 --> 17:31.249
I just need to stop
and catch my breath.

17:31.284 --> 17:33.051
You keep going, Beshte.

17:33.086 --> 17:34.419
I'll be right behind you.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.187
We're already halfway across.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.023
I know you can do it.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.124
Okay, Dad.

17:39.159 --> 17:42.127
And this time
they'll be straight and true.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.395
I'll make you proud.

17:43.430 --> 17:46.431
<i> Twende Kiboko!</i>

17:46.466 --> 17:49.134
You always make me proud,
Beshte.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.202
I'll be right behind you!

17:58.445 --> 18:04.382
Get rid of the hippo,
get rid of the rules.

18:04.418 --> 18:09.354
Then we can do whatever we
want in the flood plains.

18:09.389 --> 18:12.357
We could've stayed home
and been soaking wet there.

18:12.392 --> 18:13.925
Ugh.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.326
We'll tell you
when it's safe to go.

18:15.362 --> 18:19.364
For now, do you think you can
just stand there and be quiet?

18:23.303 --> 18:26.037
Not again! Stand up!

18:26.073 --> 18:27.972
What a surprise.

18:28.008 --> 18:30.241
The Lion Guard
is telling us what to do.

18:35.348 --> 18:37.248
Come on! Get up!

18:37.284 --> 18:39.084
You heard me!

18:39.119 --> 18:41.319
Do this. Do that.

18:41.354 --> 18:44.022
Fuli, what are you doing?

18:44.057 --> 18:47.292
I'm trying to get this
stubborn antelope to stand up.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.427
Blah, blah, blah.

18:50.397 --> 18:51.396
Hey, everybody!

18:51.431 --> 18:54.032
Beshte!
Big B!

18:54.067 --> 18:56.000
We did it, Dad!

18:56.036 --> 18:59.037
Straight and true!
Dad?

19:00.240 --> 19:02.006
Dad?!

19:02.943 --> 19:03.975
Where's he going?

19:07.414 --> 19:09.314
Oh! He did it!

19:09.349 --> 19:12.083
Beshte's new hippo lane
is straight and true.

19:12.119 --> 19:14.052
All the way across
the flood plain!

19:14.087 --> 19:16.672
Ya hear that?
Beshte's showing us the way!

19:16.673 --> 19:20.325
Come on, everybody!
Follow that hippo!

19:20.360 --> 19:23.194
But the flood plain looks so wet.

19:23.230 --> 19:26.030
You're already wet!
We're all wet!

19:26.066 --> 19:29.033
Here we go again.
Go on, yell at us.

19:29.069 --> 19:30.401
Just like
you've been doing all day.

19:30.437 --> 19:34.973
Okay.
Sorry I yelled.

19:35.008 --> 19:36.274
It's been a long day.

19:36.309 --> 19:41.112
And I know you're all tired,
wet, and hungry.

19:41.148 --> 19:44.048
Truth is, so am I.

19:44.084 --> 19:49.020
But if you want to be a little
less wet and get something to eat,

19:49.055 --> 19:52.965
you can just use that hippo lane
to get across the flood plain.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.026
Please?

19:56.196 --> 19:59.998
- That's all we wanted to hear.
- Really?

20:00.033 --> 20:02.233
Of course!
It never hurts to be polite.

20:02.269 --> 20:05.036
You heard the cheetah.
Let's go, everybody!

20:06.473 --> 20:08.973
Go! Go! Go!

20:09.009 --> 20:12.210
There you are! Don't ever
scare me like that again.

20:13.380 --> 20:16.080
- What's going on?
- Beshte did it.

20:16.116 --> 20:18.149
This one goes straight
across the flood plain.

20:18.185 --> 20:20.985
Finally,
something's gone right today!

20:22.455 --> 20:25.456
Gotta go help Beshte.

20:25.492 --> 20:27.058
What's the hurry?

20:27.093 --> 20:30.061
We've got a nice, big meal planned.

20:30.096 --> 20:31.396
And you're the guest of honor.

20:32.365 --> 20:35.200
Makuu! Leave my dad alone!

20:35.235 --> 20:38.369
This time we've got
numbers on our side.

20:38.405 --> 20:44.209
And we're crocodiles!
Ah!

20:44.244 --> 20:45.476
We can handle 'em, son.

20:45.512 --> 20:47.212
But Dad, you're hurt.

20:49.115 --> 20:52.016
Nowhere to run, hippos!

20:52.052 --> 20:55.186
I think we need a new lane,
Dad. Stick with me!

20:55.222 --> 20:57.355
<i> Twende Kiboko!</i>

20:57.390 --> 21:00.391
You can't escape that easy!
After them!

21:02.062 --> 21:03.328
What are you doing, son?

21:03.363 --> 21:05.029
Straight and true, remember?

21:05.065 --> 21:07.165
Not this time, Dad.
Trust me.

21:13.173 --> 21:15.039
Dive! Dive!

21:17.210 --> 21:19.710
- You hear something?
- No.

21:21.281 --> 21:24.282
Good thinking, Beshte.

21:24.317 --> 21:27.151
Makuu? We went
to a lot of trouble

21:27.187 --> 21:29.287
to make these lanes
nice and safe for everyone.

21:29.322 --> 21:32.290
So why don't you use them
and get outta here!

21:41.468 --> 21:43.434
You guys did a great job.

21:43.470 --> 21:47.100
I'll say. Everyone
loves the new hippo lane!

21:50.176 --> 21:53.011
Guess you're pretty good at
making them after all, Beshte.

21:53.046 --> 21:56.114
- Thanks, Ono.
- I never had any doubt.
