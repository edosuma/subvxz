19:40.379 --> 19:42.914
Can't I just be a good guy?

19:42.914 --> 19:46.285
All right, here's the angle.

19:46.452 --> 19:47.986
Sure, I could've
nailed that shut tonight,

19:47.986 --> 19:50.889
but then she'd feel guilty,
and that'd be the end of it.

19:50.889 --> 19:52.591
But if I play me cards right,

19:52.591 --> 19:55.026
and wait till
the marriage fizzles,

19:55.026 --> 19:56.228
then it pays off big.

19:56.228 --> 19:57.696
It's like a savings bond

19:57.696 --> 20:01.166
with hot sex dividends.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.101
I'm not buying it.

20:03.101 --> 20:06.505
I think you might actually be
a good guy.

20:07.172 --> 20:09.475
I'm just kidding.
You're a dirtbag.

Hey, Jeff.

20:18.817 --> 20:19.385
Yeah?

20:19.385 --> 20:20.486
I thought you'd wanna know,

20:20.486 --> 20:22.388
things with me and Barb
are okay now.

20:22.388 --> 20:23.522
Oh, thanks
for waking me up.

20:23.522 --> 20:27.793
That could not have waited
till the morning.

20:30.195 --> 20:33.098
Hey, what Barb and Rick
are going through...

20:33.098 --> 20:34.466
Could that happen to us?

20:34.466 --> 20:37.035
Sure. Sure.

20:37.035 --> 20:38.304
What do you mean?

20:38.304 --> 20:38.804
I mean it's 5 a.m.

20:38.804 --> 20:43.442
If you don't stop talking,
we're through.

20:45.777 --> 20:49.080
You know, I really thought that
they had the perfect marriage,

20:49.080 --> 20:50.015
you know?[SIGHS]

20:50.015 --> 20:52.551
I guess they were just too good
to be true.

20:52.551 --> 20:55.954
Well, that's what I like
about us.

20:55.954 --> 20:58.257
We're not too good to be true.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.991
We're just good enough.

[CHUCKLES LIGHTLY]

21:04.195 --> 21:05.697
What are you doing?

21:05.697 --> 21:09.835
If we ever renew our vows,
I wanna remember that phrase.

21:09.835 --> 21:14.239
Really? Heh. You think about
renewing our vows?

21:14.239 --> 21:18.310
Yeah, you're right.
