WEBVTT

00:00.754 --> 00:04.661
Hey. I came up with a better cover story.

00:05.435 --> 00:09.637
Defense Intelligence Liaison to the CIA.

00:10.073 --> 00:11.014
Is that a thing?

00:11.015 --> 00:13.103
No. But it should be.

00:13.104 --> 00:15.545
Why would they go with a
religion professor for that?

00:15.665 --> 00:17.872
Well, then again, why would
they go with a religion professor

00:17.873 --> 00:19.256
for the actual job?

00:19.257 --> 00:21.792
- POTUS wants you. Coffee?
- No, thank you.

00:21.793 --> 00:24.962
Let's just see if I
pass this final review

00:24.963 --> 00:28.165
before we start worrying
about a cover story.

00:28.166 --> 00:30.568
Oh, my God.

00:30.569 --> 00:34.572
You have literally
been shot by terrorists,

00:34.573 --> 00:36.674
and you're nervous about a job interview?

00:36.675 --> 00:38.841
- I'm not nervous.
- Uh-huh.

00:38.842 --> 00:40.611
I just have this thing about bureaucracy.

00:40.612 --> 00:42.780
I hate it. I have
enough of it in academia.

00:42.781 --> 00:45.483
Now I'm wading back
into it up to my neck.

00:45.484 --> 00:47.618
Do I even want this job?

00:47.619 --> 00:49.787
Special Activities Division?

00:49.788 --> 00:50.955
SAD.

00:50.956 --> 00:52.656
I'm sure there's not a bounty of jokes

00:52.657 --> 00:54.492
about that floating around the cafeteria.

00:54.493 --> 00:55.759
You're gonna be fine.

00:55.760 --> 00:57.294
- I'm not nervous...
- Mom! Mom!

00:57.295 --> 00:57.953
Yeah?

00:57.954 --> 00:59.830
Mom, are you kidding
about the text you sent us?

00:59.831 --> 01:01.966
Let's put it this way.
You might as well be.

01:01.967 --> 01:03.400
- Did I miss a text?
- No.

01:03.401 --> 01:05.575
Do you remember that
cabin that we used to rent

01:05.576 --> 01:07.838
on the Staunton River
when the kids were little?

01:07.839 --> 01:10.508
I saw on Airbnb that it's available.

01:10.509 --> 01:12.445
This weekend. The same one.

01:12.446 --> 01:15.248
- Cabin 12. How cool is that?
- Yeah.

01:15.249 --> 01:17.578
Because, you know, maybe the
last family that stayed there

01:17.579 --> 01:18.613
got ax murdered.

01:18.614 --> 01:19.947
Stop.

01:19.948 --> 01:21.215
You don't even remember it.

01:21.216 --> 01:23.113
But the girls will tell
you how much fun it was.

01:23.114 --> 01:23.985
Do you remember?

01:23.986 --> 01:25.286
Fly-fishing

01:25.287 --> 01:26.320
and art projects,

01:26.321 --> 01:28.389
cooking out over an open flame.

01:28.390 --> 01:30.591
I mean, we used to play board games

01:30.592 --> 01:32.027
by candlelight. You remember that?

01:32.028 --> 01:34.095
Because the place has no electricity.

01:34.096 --> 01:35.997
- What do you mean by that?
- It's a box

01:35.998 --> 01:37.231
with cold running water.

01:37.232 --> 01:39.434
- What?
- You loved it.

01:39.435 --> 01:41.769
The "back to nature" thing.

01:41.770 --> 01:45.239
Getting in touch with
those off-the-grid skills.

01:45.240 --> 01:47.742
You know, it is very empowering to know

01:47.743 --> 01:49.983
that you can survive
without all the amenities.

01:49.984 --> 01:51.846
Yeah, that's gonna be a hard no for me.

01:51.847 --> 01:56.384
Would you do your mom a favor, please?

01:56.385 --> 01:59.620
I mean, before you all fly the coop.

01:59.621 --> 02:03.925
When are we gonna get a chance
to do something like this again?

02:03.926 --> 02:05.793
I'll bet you that Stevie's on board.

02:05.794 --> 02:07.829
Did you see her text?

02:07.830 --> 02:09.630
No.

02:09.631 --> 02:11.332
Wow.

02:11.333 --> 02:13.100
That's a lot of "ha's".

02:13.101 --> 02:15.136
Why don't we just go to the horse farm

02:15.137 --> 02:16.504
if you're jonesing for nature?

02:16.505 --> 02:18.539
That's boring, too, but
at least it's comfortable.

02:18.540 --> 02:20.708
Because that has all the amenities.

02:20.709 --> 02:22.810
That's totally on the grid.

02:22.811 --> 02:23.878
The Wi-Fi's spotty.

02:23.879 --> 02:25.480
Yeah, that's plenty wilderness for me.

02:25.481 --> 02:28.316
Okay, you know what, I'm not gonna drag

02:28.317 --> 02:31.619
anyone kicking and screaming
into my beautiful dream.

02:31.620 --> 02:33.387
- Okay, great.
- Thanks, Mom.

02:33.388 --> 02:35.389
Okay,

02:35.390 --> 02:37.391
I got to go be SAD.

02:37.392 --> 02:39.626
See, I'm doing it already.

02:43.798 --> 02:45.399
...and in international news,

02:45.400 --> 02:47.768
military observers are
alarmed by a sudden buildup

02:47.769 --> 02:50.538
of Russian naval forces in the Black Sea,

02:50.539 --> 02:52.974
- a strategic waterway bordered by...
- What the hell, Russia?

02:52.975 --> 02:55.910
Can't take our eye off you
for a second. Just like my son.

02:55.911 --> 02:58.613
Self-destructive boneheaded
move after another.

02:58.614 --> 03:00.615
Are you talking to me?

03:00.616 --> 03:02.216
Well, yeah. Who'd you think?

03:02.217 --> 03:03.885
Joining us to comment on the situation...

03:03.886 --> 03:05.553
I don't know. It's been years

03:05.554 --> 03:08.155
since anybody yelled
at me from another room.

03:08.156 --> 03:09.357
Well, welcome back, gorgeous.

03:09.358 --> 03:10.725
You want breakfast?

03:10.726 --> 03:12.793
- I have to go to work.
- Dinner?

03:12.794 --> 03:15.129
- I have to stay at work.
- Does Bess ever let you eat?

03:15.130 --> 03:16.963
Do I need to have a
conversation with her?

03:22.937 --> 03:24.138
I'll call you.

03:24.139 --> 03:26.641
Hey, what did the satellite
say to Mission Control?

03:26.642 --> 03:27.470
I don't know, Mike.

03:27.471 --> 03:29.477
"I feel like you're
keeping me at a distance."

03:29.478 --> 03:31.112
You can do better than that.

03:31.113 --> 03:33.481
I know. It was a Hail Mary.
You were headed for the door.

03:33.482 --> 03:36.050
We agreed this was an experiment.

03:36.051 --> 03:37.418
And it's going pretty
well, don't you think?

03:37.419 --> 03:39.099
I mean, even Gordon's
happy. Right, Gordon?

03:40.589 --> 03:42.957
I'm keeping this quiet.

03:42.958 --> 03:44.725
Especially at work.

03:44.726 --> 03:47.128
I need you to respect that, okay?

03:47.129 --> 03:49.564
For how long?

03:49.565 --> 03:52.399
Foreseeable future.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.769
So that's how it's gonna be, huh?

03:54.770 --> 03:56.737
Mm-hmm.

03:56.738 --> 03:59.340
Okay. Just, you know, go

03:59.341 --> 04:01.074
straighten out the world, will ya?

04:05.947 --> 04:07.748
She's killing me.

04:07.749 --> 04:09.417
Put it all together, and you have

04:09.418 --> 04:11.886
a very volatile situation on your hands.

04:11.887 --> 04:15.722
Tensions between Russia and NATO
are already at an all-time high.

04:16.423 --> 04:19.759
What on earth is Russia up to?

04:20.428 --> 04:23.331
Russia? The Black Sea Fleet?

04:23.332 --> 04:25.766
I was just thinking about that.

04:25.767 --> 04:28.868
Really?

04:29.637 --> 04:32.239
You seem to be in a
pretty good mood today.

04:32.240 --> 04:34.141
Considering everything.

04:34.142 --> 04:37.645
I guess I just got a good night's sleep.

04:37.646 --> 04:39.413
FYI for your press briefing

04:39.414 --> 04:42.216
this morning. I'm going to be
meeting later this afternoon

04:42.217 --> 04:43.517
with Audrey Stewart.

04:43.518 --> 04:45.419
She's the mother of Philip Stewart.

04:45.420 --> 04:47.655
The American serviceman who
died last year in Ukraine.

04:47.656 --> 04:51.258
That's right. His body was
mistakenly interred in Russia.

04:51.259 --> 04:54.795
Please emphasize we are doing
everything we possibly can

04:54.796 --> 04:55.963
to bring him home.

04:55.964 --> 04:57.965
But, in reality, they're stalling us.

04:57.966 --> 04:59.532
Of course.

05:02.336 --> 05:04.405
The Russian Black Sea Fleet

05:04.406 --> 05:06.440
just steamed out of Sevastopol.

05:06.441 --> 05:07.742
Four frigates, eight assault ships,

05:07.743 --> 05:09.677
and a guided missile cruiser.

05:09.678 --> 05:12.380
And they're on a direct
course for the Bulgarian coast.

05:12.381 --> 05:15.950
What's the word from the
Russian Foreign Ministry?

05:15.951 --> 05:19.654
Avdonin says it's
routine military exercises

05:19.655 --> 05:21.489
to test new equipment.

05:21.490 --> 05:23.658
Yeah, testing their readiness

05:23.659 --> 05:24.859
to invade a NATO country.

05:24.860 --> 05:26.260
We could issue a démarche.

05:26.261 --> 05:27.762
Demand they return to port

05:27.763 --> 05:30.097
and condemn their behavior as hostile

05:30.098 --> 05:31.839
to the safe navigation of the Black Sea.

05:31.840 --> 05:33.528
Well, the rhetoric coming out
of their propaganda channels

05:33.529 --> 05:35.403
has been pretty hot.

05:35.404 --> 05:37.304
Ma'am, Russell Jackson
wants to meet right away.

05:37.305 --> 05:39.639
And he's requested you wear flats.

05:40.374 --> 05:41.509
Why?

05:41.510 --> 05:42.943
I didn't ask.

05:42.944 --> 05:44.945
I thought it might be classified.

05:44.946 --> 05:46.946
Or weird.

05:47.682 --> 05:49.350
It's probably both.

05:49.351 --> 05:51.852
I hope you don't mind.

05:51.853 --> 05:53.888
My wife still checks my steps.

05:53.889 --> 05:55.856
She wants me alive for some reason.

05:55.857 --> 05:57.992
Eh, I'll agree with her on that.

05:57.993 --> 05:59.960
So do I. I just wish I
could do it in a hammock

05:59.961 --> 06:01.729
with short ribs.

06:01.730 --> 06:04.031
You're going to Brussels.

06:04.032 --> 06:05.599
The president wants you to participate

06:05.600 --> 06:08.969
in a NATO ministerial
about this Bulgaria crisis.

06:08.970 --> 06:10.471
We're there already?

06:10.472 --> 06:12.940
What's Ambassador Newman saying?

06:12.941 --> 06:16.077
Newman's a tenor who sits
on a phone book to drive.

06:16.078 --> 06:17.678
He can't help us.

06:17.679 --> 06:20.981
The situation requires some brass balls.

06:20.982 --> 06:23.350
So you're sending me in.

06:23.351 --> 06:26.721
Well, there's a compliment
in there somewhere.

06:26.722 --> 06:30.224
Half an hour ago, a group of
armed men calling themselves

06:30.225 --> 06:31.959
the Citizens Rightful Army

06:31.960 --> 06:35.296
seized the Defense
Staff Building in Sofia.

06:35.297 --> 06:37.765
Citizens Rightful Army?

06:37.766 --> 06:39.033
I've never heard of that.

06:39.034 --> 06:40.701
Well, no one has. SIGINT intercepted

06:40.702 --> 06:42.570
some handheld radio communications

06:42.571 --> 06:43.804
between the insurgents.

06:43.805 --> 06:45.372
Which would be normal,

06:45.373 --> 06:48.209
except for the fact that
they were speaking Russian.

06:48.210 --> 06:50.177
- It's a false flag.
- Yeah.

06:50.178 --> 06:54.381
DIA ID'd the insurgents
as Russian Naval Spetsnaz.

06:54.382 --> 06:56.917
We're looking at Crimea all over again.

06:56.918 --> 06:59.954
Except this time it's an
attack against a NATO ally.

06:59.955 --> 07:02.089
Hence your trip to Brussels.

07:02.090 --> 07:04.091
We want to invoke Article 5.

07:04.092 --> 07:07.328
"An attack against one

07:07.329 --> 07:09.797
is considered an attack against all."

07:09.798 --> 07:12.700
Yeah. Only the second
time in NATO history.

07:12.701 --> 07:14.568
9/11, that was a no-brainer.

07:14.569 --> 07:17.471
But this one, this one
may take more persuasion.

07:17.472 --> 07:19.473
I understand.

07:19.474 --> 07:21.242
If this thing spirals,

07:21.243 --> 07:23.144
we could be looking at
the rest of Eastern Europe

07:23.145 --> 07:25.745
through an iron curtain.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.521
Mrs. Stewart.

07:33.522 --> 07:35.990
Oh.

07:35.991 --> 07:39.260
I'm so sorry to keep you
waiting, Mrs. Stewart.

07:39.261 --> 07:42.062
I'm Nadine Tolliver. We
spoke on the telephone.

07:42.063 --> 07:45.132
I, um, thought the secretary was coming.

07:45.133 --> 07:48.135
Unfortunately, she was
called to the White House.

07:48.136 --> 07:51.305
But she sends her regrets,
and she asked me to tell you

07:51.306 --> 07:54.875
that we are doing
everything we possibly can

07:54.876 --> 07:56.644
to bring Philip home.

07:56.645 --> 08:00.247
Well, you're already a lot
nicer than Veterans Affairs.

08:00.248 --> 08:02.116
They never say "Philip,"

08:02.117 --> 08:04.552
just "remains."

08:04.553 --> 08:07.388
Well,

08:07.389 --> 08:10.257
we are, all of us,

08:10.258 --> 08:12.459
deeply grateful

08:12.460 --> 08:16.329
for your son's service in
the conflict in Ukraine.

08:17.598 --> 08:22.101
It's such an unfortunate mistake.

08:22.837 --> 08:24.505
Well,

08:24.506 --> 08:27.608
the fog of war, I'm told.

08:27.609 --> 08:32.645
But now, with everything
heating up with Russia again,

08:32.647 --> 08:34.347
that's just gonna make it harder, right?

08:34.349 --> 08:38.152
Well, our embassy is
still open in Moscow.

08:38.153 --> 08:40.621
And I'm working directly
with our ambassador

08:40.621 --> 08:42.923
to locate Corporal Stewart's...

08:42.924 --> 08:45.492
accidental place of burial.

08:45.493 --> 08:49.463
It's a year I've been at this.

08:49.464 --> 08:51.599
I'm sorry.

08:51.600 --> 08:55.302
I don't even understand
why he was in Ukraine,

08:55.303 --> 08:58.873
what that had to do with
our national security.

08:58.874 --> 09:02.643
Now I just want to bury my son

09:02.644 --> 09:06.279
on the soil he believed
he died to protect.

09:07.014 --> 09:09.115
Is that too much to ask?

09:09.850 --> 09:11.986
No.

09:11.987 --> 09:14.320
No, it isn't.

09:16.924 --> 09:20.060
The director said you got
the job. Just like that.

09:20.061 --> 09:22.396
He barely interviewed me.

09:22.397 --> 09:24.431
- I meet my team tomorrow.
- Well, he knows you.

09:24.432 --> 09:26.333
And, again, POTUS.

09:26.334 --> 09:29.036
You were SAD

09:29.037 --> 09:30.804
- for nothin'.
- Okay.

09:30.805 --> 09:33.407
Putting a limit on the SAD jokes.

09:33.408 --> 09:36.010
- Yeah, good luck with that.
- So, Brussels.

09:36.011 --> 09:38.279
You're really gonna invoke Article 5?

09:38.280 --> 09:41.348
Yeah. Second time in
history. No pressure.

09:41.349 --> 09:44.351
And there's this really
kind of weird system,

09:44.352 --> 09:48.289
where there's no voting but the
agreement has to be unanimous.

09:48.290 --> 09:50.291
I have no idea how that's gonna work.

09:50.292 --> 09:51.992
Listen, speaking of votes,

09:51.993 --> 09:54.995
I worked on the kids, but
no luck with the whole...

09:54.996 --> 09:57.197
- cabin resolution.
- Oh, come on!

09:57.198 --> 09:59.333
Babe, they're young people

09:59.334 --> 10:01.669
who are socially engaged.
They're addicted to technology.

10:01.670 --> 10:02.670
That's the point.

10:02.671 --> 10:04.438
I-I worry

10:04.439 --> 10:07.940
that they can't live
without their devices.

10:09.610 --> 10:12.579
Just once, I would like to
have a vacation with the kids

10:12.580 --> 10:15.416
where I am really with them.

10:15.417 --> 10:18.686
Before they really leave home.

10:18.687 --> 10:20.220
I got a better idea.

10:20.221 --> 10:22.289
Why don't you and I go up to the cabin

10:22.290 --> 10:24.224
and have a romantic weekend.

10:24.225 --> 10:25.826
We haven't done that in a while.

10:25.827 --> 10:28.662
Yeah. Well, that's... I-I guess.

10:28.663 --> 10:31.165
Not taking that personally.

10:31.166 --> 10:33.400
Well, the cabin is all about family.

10:33.401 --> 10:34.668
We're all up there,

10:34.669 --> 10:37.972
huddled under the same
uncomfortable roof,

10:37.973 --> 10:42.810
finding ways to dwindle
down the hours after hours.

10:44.312 --> 10:46.880
Look, I don't want to go if
it's gonna make you miserable.

10:46.881 --> 10:49.116
No, we're gonna have a romantic weekend.

10:49.117 --> 10:52.720
You said. It's better than nothing.

10:52.721 --> 10:55.589
Now, you see, it's just that attitude

10:55.590 --> 10:57.491
that's kept the flame alive.

10:59.561 --> 11:02.229
There it is. The flame's alive.

11:02.230 --> 11:04.931
- It's alive, it's Ali...
- Stop.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.635
The government of France

11:08.636 --> 11:11.572
is pleased to present this
latest draft resolution.

11:11.573 --> 11:14.875
And I hope that this will
bring us one step closer

11:14.876 --> 11:16.710
- to the agreement.
- I-I'm looking

11:16.711 --> 11:20.246
at the phrasing in paragraph three.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.884
"We, the 28 members
of NATO, are determined

11:23.885 --> 11:26.653
to investigate this incursion."

11:26.654 --> 11:29.556
I'm sorry, when did "repel"

11:29.557 --> 11:32.426
become "investigate"?

11:32.427 --> 11:34.728
Madame Beauvais,

11:34.729 --> 11:35.996
the evidence has been presented.

11:35.997 --> 11:38.866
Russian involvement is clear.

11:38.867 --> 11:42.202
But the Citizens Rightful
Army claims to be Bulgarian.

11:42.203 --> 11:45.706
We must be certain that this
incursion meets the criteria

11:45.707 --> 11:48.642
for the kind of attack
that would invoke Article 5.

11:48.643 --> 11:50.210
I assure you,

11:50.211 --> 11:52.479
these are not Bulgarians.

11:52.480 --> 11:54.348
And we are running out of time.

11:54.349 --> 11:57.051
We have been through
eight drafts already.

11:57.052 --> 11:59.019
Where we need to be is in lockstep

11:59.020 --> 12:01.388
against anything that
threatens the alliance.

12:01.389 --> 12:04.858
I understand, but French
lives are also at stake.

12:04.859 --> 12:06.860
All members of NATO are
putting lives at risk.

12:06.861 --> 12:07.928
Perhaps if we

12:07.929 --> 12:09.963
exclude the use of force.

12:09.964 --> 12:12.699
We have to authorize force.

12:12.700 --> 12:14.368
Otherwise Russia will be free

12:14.369 --> 12:16.670
to run the table in Eastern Europe.

12:16.671 --> 12:18.238
As always, the United States

12:18.239 --> 12:20.107
is impatient with diplomacy

12:20.108 --> 12:22.076
and quick to war.

12:22.077 --> 12:24.244
This aggression is an act of war.

12:24.245 --> 12:26.680
We must be in agreement on that.

12:26.681 --> 12:27.981
Yes, we must.

12:27.982 --> 12:30.284
The alliance cannot survive

12:30.285 --> 12:34.321
unless it has the cooperation
of all its members.

12:34.322 --> 12:36.290
Well, then, Madam Secretary,

12:36.291 --> 12:37.891
it may not survive.

12:37.892 --> 12:41.095
Someone has to have
the courage to say no.

12:41.096 --> 12:42.930
The Republic of France hereby withdraws

12:42.931 --> 12:44.364
from the Atlantic Council.

13:04.419 --> 13:05.753
- What the hell was that?
- Ma'am.

13:05.754 --> 13:08.360
The new Iron Curtain
falling over Eastern Europe,

13:08.361 --> 13:10.662
- our NATO allies clamoring for help,
- Ma'am.

13:10.663 --> 13:11.997
and she just walks out?

13:11.998 --> 13:13.866
- Ma'am.
- What, Nadine?

13:13.867 --> 13:15.467
We're getting word that
several key ministers

13:15.468 --> 13:17.135
from Bulgaria's government

13:17.136 --> 13:19.638
- have fled Sofia.
- Place is hanging by a thread.

13:19.639 --> 13:22.140
We need to get France back on
board while there's still time.

13:22.141 --> 13:24.142
If the threat of a resurgent Russia

13:24.143 --> 13:26.444
doesn't rattle him, what will?

13:28.180 --> 13:29.481
Mike Barnow.

13:29.482 --> 13:31.149
What about him?

13:31.150 --> 13:33.185
Right, right.

13:33.186 --> 13:36.388
He worked for Perrin's
opponent's campaign last year.

13:36.389 --> 13:39.558
Maybe he has oppo research
that could move the needle.

13:39.559 --> 13:40.993
Call him.

13:40.994 --> 13:43.794
I'll break him before
I let him break NATO.

13:53.572 --> 13:54.640
Good morning, Daisy.

13:54.641 --> 13:56.941
- Yeah, hi.
- Nadine.

14:04.483 --> 14:06.151
Before we go any further,

14:06.152 --> 14:07.886
you need to understand
that nothing we discuss

14:07.887 --> 14:10.145
can come back to me. My reputation...

14:10.146 --> 14:12.257
and therefore, my
business... depends on it.

14:12.258 --> 14:13.458
Seriously?

14:13.459 --> 14:15.265
It's part of my thing. Okay, then.

14:15.266 --> 14:16.767
On to the kompromat. The Russians

14:16.768 --> 14:18.001
have more words for "blackmail"

14:18.002 --> 14:19.770
than the Eskimos have for "snow".

14:19.771 --> 14:21.739
That's what we're doing, right?

14:21.740 --> 14:24.374
- We prefer "inducements."
- Aw.

14:24.375 --> 14:26.343
So, in last year's
presidential campaign in France,

14:26.344 --> 14:29.012
I did some consulting work for
President Perrin's opponent,

14:29.013 --> 14:30.714
- Jacques Brunet.
- He's a good man.

14:30.715 --> 14:33.450
He's a milksop, which is why
he's not President Brunet.

14:33.451 --> 14:35.486
He wouldn't use the dirt

14:35.487 --> 14:37.221
you gathered on Perrin?

14:37.222 --> 14:39.223
Not Perrin. Perrin's son.

14:39.224 --> 14:40.691
Michel.

14:40.692 --> 14:42.059
He's an investment guy, right?

14:42.060 --> 14:44.827
Not anymore. Want to know why?

14:45.729 --> 14:47.831
Hand in Le cookie jar. To the tune

14:47.832 --> 14:49.333
of tens of millions of euros.

14:49.334 --> 14:51.635
At least that's what Interpol thinks.

14:51.636 --> 14:53.504
But Perrin ran against corruption.

14:53.505 --> 14:54.738
Oops.

14:54.739 --> 14:56.807
The investigation was
secret during the election,

14:56.808 --> 14:59.777
but it's ongoing. So even
though Michel left his firm,

14:59.778 --> 15:02.144
this could sink Perrin and his family.

15:04.148 --> 15:06.950
So the play is to threaten to expose him

15:06.951 --> 15:09.019
- if he doesn't back NATO.
- And/or

15:09.020 --> 15:10.420
to make Interpol's investigation go away

15:10.421 --> 15:12.188
if he does the right thing.

15:15.159 --> 15:17.161
It's what you asked for.

15:17.162 --> 15:20.164
It is.

15:20.165 --> 15:21.797
Thanks, Mike.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.302
Salnikov clearly aims

15:25.303 --> 15:27.805
to take Bulgaria, and
with NATO in shambles...

15:27.806 --> 15:29.639
There's no one to stop him.

15:30.674 --> 15:32.743
The question is why now?

15:32.744 --> 15:34.211
Russia's been looking
to expand its borders

15:34.212 --> 15:38.081
ever since Pavel Ostrov came
to power seven years ago.

15:38.082 --> 15:40.384
But why is Salnikov

15:40.385 --> 15:43.287
going after a NATO country?

15:43.288 --> 15:45.455
- Why be so brazen?
- He's making

15:45.456 --> 15:47.257
this big move, so you'd think he'd want

15:47.258 --> 15:49.193
his most trusted advisers by his side.

15:49.194 --> 15:51.428
Instead, he spent

15:51.429 --> 15:54.965
the last four months cleaning house.

15:54.966 --> 15:57.935
If Salnikov's behavior
is increasingly erratic

15:57.936 --> 16:00.237
and aggressive...

16:00.238 --> 16:01.805
could be a sign that he feels

16:01.806 --> 16:04.975
he's losing his grip on Russia.

16:04.976 --> 16:07.377
And... who comes for the king

16:07.378 --> 16:09.913
- when he's vulnerable?
- His generals.

16:09.914 --> 16:12.449
And yet whoever Salnikov
appointed theater commander

16:12.450 --> 16:14.918
of the Bulgaria mission must
still be in his good graces.

16:14.919 --> 16:17.387
We think it's Vladimir Doroshevich.

16:17.388 --> 16:19.923
He's a hardliner, and one
of Ostrov's right-hand men.

16:19.924 --> 16:21.992
You worked on Intel
inside Doroshevich's team

16:21.993 --> 16:24.828
during the Ukraine
invasion, isn't that right?

16:24.829 --> 16:25.896
Yes.

16:25.897 --> 16:28.332
The file says your asset, Dmitri Petrov,

16:28.333 --> 16:31.901
was compromised and probably executed.

16:33.170 --> 16:35.738
Do you have any other access?

16:37.374 --> 16:39.642
I might.

16:46.750 --> 16:48.719
I'm onto you.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.687
I beg your pardon?

16:50.688 --> 16:51.955
I saw you

16:51.956 --> 16:53.790
checking out his butt.

16:53.791 --> 16:56.126
To whose butt are we referring?

16:56.127 --> 16:57.761
Oh, Nadine, come on.

16:57.762 --> 16:59.263
I'm pregnant and alone.

16:59.264 --> 17:00.998
If you're having some
awesome, torrid affair

17:00.999 --> 17:02.366
you have to let me in.

17:02.367 --> 17:03.333
Boom.

17:03.334 --> 17:05.402
- How long?
- Since election night.

17:05.403 --> 17:07.604
Off and on.

17:07.605 --> 17:09.473
- Lately, mostly on.
- Oh!

17:09.473 --> 17:11.974
Damn, Mike B.

17:11.976 --> 17:13.542
Who knew?

17:13.544 --> 17:16.480
I mean, I-I hardly know
anything about him, really.

17:16.481 --> 17:17.714
Hmm.

17:17.714 --> 17:20.416
Well, okay... he has some kind of

17:20.417 --> 17:22.048
troubled relationship with his son.

17:22.049 --> 17:22.853
Mm-hmm.

17:22.854 --> 17:25.722
His ex-wife seems to hate him.

17:25.723 --> 17:27.491
And he's too close to his dog.

17:27.492 --> 17:29.259
Okay, have you done a background check?

17:29.260 --> 17:30.594
Oh, of course not. No.

17:30.595 --> 17:34.131
Have you at least, you know, trolled him?

17:34.132 --> 17:35.399
Oh... I...

17:35.400 --> 17:36.934
That's... stalky.

17:36.935 --> 17:39.636
Yesterday's stalky is
today's getting to know you.

17:39.637 --> 17:41.238
Take it from the girl who got knocked up

17:41.239 --> 17:43.974
- by a guy with a false identity.
- We'll start small.

17:43.975 --> 17:47.311
Image search. Ah.
Correspondents' Dinner photo op

17:47.312 --> 17:48.979
- with Al Roker.
- Okay.

17:48.980 --> 17:52.316
Wow, Mike. The '80s called
and they want their tux back.

17:53.651 --> 17:54.818
Oh, look.

17:54.819 --> 17:57.754
He's on some charity softball team.

17:57.755 --> 17:59.690
Oh.

17:59.691 --> 18:01.091
What?

18:01.092 --> 18:02.826
Nothing.

18:02.827 --> 18:03.994
What?

18:03.995 --> 18:05.562
That could be from a while back.

18:05.563 --> 18:06.730
Oh...

18:06.731 --> 18:08.632
shoot.

18:08.633 --> 18:10.500
- Almost a while back.
- It's three months ago.

18:10.501 --> 18:11.768
I mean, they don't necessarily

18:11.769 --> 18:13.403
look together together.

18:13.404 --> 18:15.973
Did you guys discuss exclusivity?

18:15.974 --> 18:19.476
Nope.

18:19.477 --> 18:22.912
So I guess that means
that's his business.

18:24.915 --> 18:27.117
President Perrin,

18:27.118 --> 18:29.519
this is an off-the-books conversation.

18:29.520 --> 18:32.589
About an ongoing Interpol investigation

18:32.590 --> 18:33.957
into your son, Michel.

18:33.958 --> 18:35.759
Securities fraud, bribing

18:35.760 --> 18:38.695
a French market official. I'm...
I think you know the details.

18:38.696 --> 18:40.931
Are you threatening me?

18:40.932 --> 18:42.132
Not at all.

18:42.133 --> 18:45.002
The U.S. has a lot of sway over Interpol,

18:45.003 --> 18:47.437
and I am confident that we can find a way

18:47.438 --> 18:49.773
to make Michel's problems go away.

18:49.774 --> 18:51.341
Go with us

18:51.342 --> 18:52.909
on Article 5,

18:52.910 --> 18:54.444
which you know is the right thing

18:54.445 --> 18:57.647
to do, and your son will have a future.

18:57.648 --> 18:59.549
Madame, the rest of NATO

18:59.550 --> 19:01.518
can lose their minds and go to war

19:01.519 --> 19:03.186
with a nuclear superpower,

19:03.187 --> 19:05.756
but I will never allow France

19:05.757 --> 19:07.157
to be drawn into it.

19:07.158 --> 19:09.458
Not for anything.

19:12.396 --> 19:14.931
Belgium and Turkey are
wavering on troop deployment,

19:14.932 --> 19:16.433
saying if France won't join the party,

19:16.434 --> 19:18.602
they'll pull their soldiers
out of the NATO Response Force.

19:18.603 --> 19:21.505
And once that happens...

19:21.506 --> 19:23.974
the alliance is on very thin ice.

19:23.975 --> 19:26.275
Yes, ma'am.

19:27.611 --> 19:30.079
Thanks, Jay.

19:37.921 --> 19:41.058
Thanks for coming on
such short notice, Dmitri.

19:41.059 --> 19:44.627
I don't mind. I like it here.

19:46.196 --> 19:49.066
You look well.

19:49.067 --> 19:51.768
I am.

19:51.769 --> 19:55.605
So, I'm sure you've heard
what's going on in Russia.

19:55.606 --> 19:57.641
We think that, uh,

19:57.642 --> 20:00.944
your old boss, Doroshevich,

20:00.945 --> 20:03.279
is behind the Bulgarian invasion.

20:05.582 --> 20:08.185
That would not surprise me.

20:08.186 --> 20:10.020
He was always pushing Ostrov

20:10.021 --> 20:12.321
to take a more aggressive
stance towards Europe.

20:14.991 --> 20:17.260
Would you be willing to
look at some intelligence

20:17.261 --> 20:20.729
we've acquired, give me your take?

20:21.865 --> 20:23.467
When I offered my assistance before,

20:23.468 --> 20:26.369
you told me it was impossible
because of President Dalton's

20:26.370 --> 20:28.438
promise to the Russian government.

20:28.439 --> 20:29.739
What's changed?

20:29.740 --> 20:31.274
Part of the agreement with Russia

20:31.275 --> 20:33.143
is that they honor
their neighbors' borders.

20:33.144 --> 20:35.378
This incursion into Bulgaria,

20:35.379 --> 20:37.614
covert as it may be,

20:37.615 --> 20:39.315
nullifies that deal.

20:40.283 --> 20:43.018
But if Salnikov knew I was in D.C...

20:45.021 --> 20:47.624
We have ways of protecting you.

20:47.625 --> 20:49.892
It's a risk, it is.

20:51.161 --> 20:53.429
It's up to you, of course.

20:55.532 --> 20:58.034
Elizabeth, what the hell,
about Perrin? I thought

20:58.035 --> 21:00.070
Mike B. was getting you
fresh oppo on his kid.

21:00.071 --> 21:02.739
Apparently the French president
would rather kneecap NATO

21:02.740 --> 21:04.708
- than save his son.
- Well, he's gonna

21:04.709 --> 21:06.243
get his wish. We're just getting word

21:06.244 --> 21:08.945
on the latest Russian escalation.

21:08.946 --> 21:11.280
They're just getting started.

21:12.415 --> 21:13.850
The Russians' Black Sea Fleet

21:13.851 --> 21:15.785
just penetrated Bulgaria's
territorial waters.

21:15.786 --> 21:17.854
We have reports from
the Bulgarian Coast Guard

21:17.855 --> 21:19.523
that they're seizing civilian vessels

21:19.524 --> 21:20.824
and taking the crews hostage.

21:20.825 --> 21:23.059
SIGINT indicates that
the fleet is carrying

21:23.060 --> 21:26.296
10,000 shock troops
for a marine invasion.

21:26.297 --> 21:27.731
There's no way Bulgaria's military

21:27.732 --> 21:30.267
will be able to withstand that.
Because the whole point of NATO

21:30.268 --> 21:31.468
is they shouldn't have to.

21:31.469 --> 21:33.703
If Russia takes Bulgaria,

21:33.704 --> 21:35.804
they'll be in Poland by Christmas.

21:38.208 --> 21:41.043
Send the Sixth Fleet to the Black Sea.

21:42.312 --> 21:44.714
If NATO can't get it together to stand up

21:44.715 --> 21:48.051
to Russian aggression,
then we'll do it ourselves.

21:48.052 --> 21:49.052
Yes, sir.

21:56.092 --> 21:59.129
So if the most important agreement

21:59.130 --> 22:02.666
since the Magna Carta
falls apart on my watch,

22:02.667 --> 22:06.036
probably never make it on a stamp, right?

22:06.037 --> 22:07.971
Stamps are on their way out.

22:07.972 --> 22:10.639
I'm really scared.

22:12.042 --> 22:14.009
Come here.

22:17.447 --> 22:19.182
I can't even think

22:19.183 --> 22:22.018
of our kids living in a world like this.

22:22.019 --> 22:24.921
If NATO goes away, how are
they ever gonna feel safe?

22:24.922 --> 22:28.892
Not just to pursue the big things,

22:28.893 --> 22:31.895
but to... I don't... the freedom to enjoy

22:31.896 --> 22:33.430
the small, dumb stuff,

22:33.431 --> 22:36.333
like playing board games by candlelight,

22:36.334 --> 22:39.169
which they didn't even want
to do, but if they did...

22:39.170 --> 22:41.171
Hey.

22:41.172 --> 22:43.472
I've got faith.

22:44.474 --> 22:46.176
Must be nice.

22:46.177 --> 22:49.846
I'll keep it for both of us.

22:49.847 --> 22:52.449
You're gonna have to.

22:52.450 --> 22:54.884
Because if this alliance falls apart,

22:54.885 --> 22:58.153
then there won't be any
relationships to build on.

23:07.945 --> 23:09.662
POTUS is trying to ramp up

23:09.663 --> 23:11.933
our military presence around Bulgaria,

23:11.934 --> 23:13.935
but Congress is already making noises

23:13.936 --> 23:15.704
about the War Powers Act.

23:15.705 --> 23:18.840
All of which is to say,
I really wish Mike's Intel

23:18.841 --> 23:20.709
had moved the needle with France.

23:20.710 --> 23:22.577
Well, speaking of Mike, ma'am,

23:22.578 --> 23:24.780
I, uh, we need to talk.

23:24.781 --> 23:28.684
Daisy and I were doing some
investigating, and, uh...

23:28.685 --> 23:30.686
This woman, Simone LeClerc,

23:30.687 --> 23:34.356
is the president of a think tank

23:34.357 --> 23:36.258
called European Independence League.

23:36.259 --> 23:40.262
They advocate for loosening,
uh, the EU regulations, right?

23:40.263 --> 23:42.564
Well, that's their public face.

23:42.565 --> 23:45.133
But secretly,

23:45.134 --> 23:47.336
they are radically nationalist,

23:47.337 --> 23:49.771
and covertly fund efforts

23:49.772 --> 23:52.941
to dismantle the EU, NATO,

23:52.942 --> 23:56.812
and the entire European project.

23:56.813 --> 24:00.782
And Mike is dating her?

24:00.783 --> 24:03.218
Mike is working for her.

24:03.219 --> 24:04.786
Oh.

24:04.787 --> 24:05.987
Apparently,

24:05.988 --> 24:08.490
even though he was on the
other side of the campaign,

24:08.491 --> 24:10.525
they were so impressed by his work,

24:10.526 --> 24:12.828
they brought him on board.

24:12.829 --> 24:15.263
He was on their payroll
for at least a year.

24:15.264 --> 24:19.668
That's why his Intel on
Perrin didn't pan out.

24:19.669 --> 24:23.438
It was a decoy.

24:23.439 --> 24:27.109
Mike B. is a genuine snake.

24:27.110 --> 24:28.944
Ma'am,

24:28.945 --> 24:30.479
I would like to believe

24:30.480 --> 24:33.382
that he would not betray you like this.

24:33.383 --> 24:35.083
You know what?

24:35.084 --> 24:37.018
Let's just take a breath.

24:37.019 --> 24:40.288
We don't know enough yet.

24:40.289 --> 24:43.090
But we are definitely gonna find out.

24:44.126 --> 24:46.962
So strange to be looking
at these faces again.

24:46.963 --> 24:48.263
So many dead.

24:48.264 --> 24:49.998
Some I had forgotten,

24:49.999 --> 24:52.066
others, I still dream about.

24:54.336 --> 24:57.939
There's a name missing from your matrix.

24:57.940 --> 24:59.841
Who?

24:59.842 --> 25:03.412
Oleg Gruzinsky.

25:03.413 --> 25:07.516
He and Doroshevich are close
friends from university.

25:07.517 --> 25:09.818
Based on the general's recommendation,

25:09.819 --> 25:13.054
Pavel Ostrov made him
ambassador to Cyprus.

25:13.055 --> 25:15.524
Officially, he runs a
small bank on the island,

25:15.525 --> 25:18.026
but a lot of Russians launder
their money through Cyprus.

25:18.027 --> 25:19.361
So unofficially...

25:19.362 --> 25:21.696
He's Salnikov's money guy.

25:21.697 --> 25:24.132
His main job is to
deliver briefcases full

25:24.133 --> 25:26.635
of laundered cash to anyone the
government wants to influence.

25:26.636 --> 25:28.670
And there's something else.

25:28.671 --> 25:32.707
Nikolai Sergeyev and Boris Ivchenko

25:32.708 --> 25:34.109
were protégés of Gruzinsky.

25:34.110 --> 25:35.744
If Salnikov is determined to take out

25:35.745 --> 25:38.513
everyone that knows about his finances,

25:38.514 --> 25:40.248
Doroshevich will only be able

25:40.249 --> 25:42.449
to protect his old friend for so long.

25:45.086 --> 25:47.722
Gruzinsky may already be dead.

25:47.723 --> 25:50.492
Yeah, or if he's smart,
he's already on the run.

25:50.493 --> 25:52.927
I'm gonna have my team track him down.

25:54.663 --> 25:55.864
I'm back.

25:55.865 --> 25:57.132
- Hey, honey.
- Oh, hi.

25:57.133 --> 25:58.333
I-I thought, uh, you and Jareth

25:58.334 --> 25:59.634
were going to the Kennedy Center.

25:59.635 --> 26:00.702
Yeah, yeah, we are.

26:00.703 --> 26:02.804
Um, I just left the tickets

26:02.805 --> 26:04.239
in my desk upstairs.

26:04.240 --> 26:07.242
It might have been a Freudian slip.

26:07.243 --> 26:08.510
- Oh.
- Um.

26:08.511 --> 26:10.111
This is Alexander...

26:10.112 --> 26:12.080
Alexander Mironov.

26:12.081 --> 26:13.949
I, uh, work with your
father at the War College.

26:13.950 --> 26:15.283
Stevie.

26:15.284 --> 26:17.284
Nice to meet you.

26:19.588 --> 26:22.557
So Jareth is in the car waiting,

26:22.558 --> 26:24.426
so I'm just gonna get those...

26:24.427 --> 26:25.627
those tickets, yeah.

26:25.628 --> 26:26.895
Have a good time, honey.

26:26.896 --> 26:28.096
Enjoy the concert.

26:28.097 --> 26:30.197
Yeah, thank you.

26:31.266 --> 26:32.667
That was fast.

26:32.668 --> 26:35.036
According to my analyst, Oleg Gruzinsky

26:35.037 --> 26:37.305
has been in Newfoundland
for the last two months.

26:37.306 --> 26:40.542
That is a long, cold fishing trip.

26:40.543 --> 26:41.943
He's afraid to go home.

26:41.944 --> 26:44.479
I can't understand

26:44.480 --> 26:47.015
why we're sending our
troops into harm's way

26:47.016 --> 26:50.318
to defend some country most of
us could barely find on a map.

26:50.319 --> 26:52.153
And for what?

26:52.154 --> 26:54.523
To keep us safe?

26:54.524 --> 26:57.492
To make our lives better?

26:57.493 --> 26:59.394
I'm sick of hearing it.

26:59.395 --> 27:02.497
Because that's the same
excuse that killed my son.

27:02.498 --> 27:04.733
Thank you, Audrey. I'm so sorry.

27:04.734 --> 27:08.270
The War Powers Act was conceived to stop

27:08.271 --> 27:11.239
this kind of reckless
military adventurism.

27:11.240 --> 27:14.242
That's why I'm joining with
my fellow senators to demand

27:14.243 --> 27:17.012
that President Dalton
seek a formal authorization

27:17.013 --> 27:18.780
before any military action.

27:18.781 --> 27:21.383
We're not attacking some failed state.

27:21.384 --> 27:24.586
We're defending a NATO country.

27:24.587 --> 27:26.855
Besides, what's left of
Bulgaria will be flying

27:26.856 --> 27:29.391
the Russian flag before they
take the first roll call.

27:29.392 --> 27:30.926
Wars are not about tanks

27:30.927 --> 27:33.662
and planes, they're about symbols.

27:33.663 --> 27:35.664
And if we don't get the
Gold Star mother on board,

27:35.665 --> 27:38.066
we're gonna lose before firing a shot.

27:38.067 --> 27:39.801
She has interviews lined
up with every morning show

27:39.802 --> 27:41.703
that doesn't involve puppets.

27:41.704 --> 27:43.504
You got to stop her.

27:45.707 --> 27:48.843
Mrs. Stewart, thanks
for agreeing to meet me.

27:48.844 --> 27:51.546
I wanted us to talk

27:51.547 --> 27:55.617
and I thought this was
a perfect place for it.

27:55.618 --> 27:59.387
Uh, you don't have to
explain World War II to me.

27:59.388 --> 28:01.790
- Good.
- I understand that one.

28:01.791 --> 28:03.391
Good.

28:03.392 --> 28:06.194
And you also understand that
one of the greatest things

28:06.195 --> 28:08.496
to come out of all those sacrifices

28:08.497 --> 28:11.967
was the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.

28:11.968 --> 28:14.636
It was created to
prevent the circumstances

28:14.637 --> 28:17.072
that caused both world wars...

28:17.073 --> 28:19.374
an imbalance of military power

28:19.375 --> 28:20.942
among neighboring countries.

28:20.943 --> 28:23.845
People build a strong
army, they want to use it.

28:23.846 --> 28:26.414
Maybe annex a weaker country,

28:26.415 --> 28:29.017
and then another.

28:29.018 --> 28:32.854
And suddenly, everyone
has to jump into the fight.

28:32.855 --> 28:35.190
World war.

28:35.191 --> 28:37.592
And the last one produced

28:37.593 --> 28:40.996
the most dangerous weapon of all.

28:40.997 --> 28:44.366
So the superpowers met
each other's capabilities.

28:44.367 --> 28:47.669
They signed a nonproliferation agreement

28:47.670 --> 28:51.773
to stop the spread of nuclear weapons.

28:51.774 --> 28:55.176
Because of NATO we were
able to say to our allies,

28:55.177 --> 28:57.512
you don't need to build up your military,

28:57.513 --> 29:01.316
or nuclear arsenal,

29:01.317 --> 29:04.419
to feel safe from Russia
or any other enemy,

29:04.420 --> 29:07.756
because we have your back.

29:07.757 --> 29:10.125
Our army is your army.

29:10.126 --> 29:12.227
And your conflict

29:12.228 --> 29:15.262
is our conflict.

29:16.931 --> 29:19.401
If NATO fails,

29:19.402 --> 29:23.238
the European nations
will be on their own.

29:23.239 --> 29:26.408
And then everyone jumps
back into an arms race.

29:26.409 --> 29:28.777
And I truly believe that that is the end

29:28.778 --> 29:31.279
of our western democracy as we know it.

29:31.280 --> 29:32.847
And Mrs. Stewart,

29:32.848 --> 29:37.218
I can't believe that's what
your son would have wanted.

29:37.219 --> 29:39.286
Do you?

29:40.221 --> 29:41.756
I understand

29:41.757 --> 29:44.492
why you want the world

29:44.493 --> 29:47.362
to hear your story.

29:47.363 --> 29:51.131
But please, give me some
time to make this right.

30:05.480 --> 30:08.817
Checking the obituaries, Oleg?

30:08.818 --> 30:11.853
None of your compatriots died today.

30:11.854 --> 30:13.088
Yet.

30:13.089 --> 30:15.824
Who are you?

30:15.825 --> 30:20.295
I'm a friend from America.

30:20.296 --> 30:23.730
I have no friends in America.

30:25.033 --> 30:27.935
Maybe it's time to broaden your circle.

30:30.271 --> 30:33.374
I loathe our lunchtime runs.

30:33.375 --> 30:35.009
Why can't we just have salads

30:35.010 --> 30:36.578
at Café Du PARC like normal people?

30:36.579 --> 30:37.946
'Cause I didn't want anyone around

30:37.947 --> 30:39.481
for what we have to talk about.

30:39.482 --> 30:41.282
Ah. Yeah, sorry about the Perrin thing.

30:41.283 --> 30:43.618
I'm surprised the INTERPOL
thing didn't bring him around.

30:43.619 --> 30:45.487
- Were you?
- Was I what?

30:45.488 --> 30:46.888
Surprised.

30:46.889 --> 30:48.423
'Cause there's a pretty good case

30:48.424 --> 30:49.958
to be made that things played out

30:49.959 --> 30:51.960
just the way you wanted them to.

30:51.961 --> 30:53.061
Ah, dammit.

30:53.062 --> 30:55.497
The jogging thing's always an ambush.

30:58.466 --> 31:01.269
I know about your work with the
European Independence League,

31:01.270 --> 31:03.071
or the "I Hate NATO Club,"

31:03.072 --> 31:04.639
or whatever the hell it's called.

31:04.640 --> 31:06.374
Uh, and you, you think
I'm playing a double game

31:06.375 --> 31:07.909
'cause I'm still on their payroll?

31:07.910 --> 31:10.044
Well, since you didn't tell me

31:10.045 --> 31:11.412
you were on it in the
first place, yeah...

31:11.413 --> 31:12.781
- Elizabeth.
- ...I kind of do.

31:12.782 --> 31:14.616
I would never betray you.

31:14.617 --> 31:16.617
Not for the kind of money
they're offering, anyway.

31:19.654 --> 31:22.390
Fond as I am of you, Mike,

31:22.391 --> 31:23.958
you try to jack me around,

31:23.959 --> 31:26.661
my next conversation's gonna
be with the attorney general.

31:26.662 --> 31:28.129
Do you understand that?

31:28.130 --> 31:31.065
Easy. Easy. Come here.

31:31.066 --> 31:32.500
Look...

31:32.501 --> 31:35.403
My guy lost the election in France.

31:35.404 --> 31:38.072
I-I signed on with the
European Independence League.

31:38.073 --> 31:39.274
I thought the EIL

31:39.275 --> 31:40.942
was a center-right think
tank, like everybody else.

31:40.943 --> 31:42.811
I had no idea they were a
crypto-fascist creep squad.

31:42.812 --> 31:45.613
And once you uncovered
the creep squad element?

31:45.614 --> 31:47.115
I quit.

31:47.116 --> 31:48.550
Months ago.

31:48.551 --> 31:50.652
Do you want to see my
paystubs? I'm a cynic,

31:50.653 --> 31:52.520
but I-I draw the line at
trying to destroy democracy.

31:52.521 --> 31:54.422
And I-I certainly wouldn't
trade on our relationship.

31:54.423 --> 31:55.557
Well, you should have told me up front.

31:55.558 --> 31:56.658
There was nothing to tell you.

31:56.659 --> 31:58.193
And by the way, I don't work for you.

31:58.194 --> 31:59.460
I'm not one of your little people.

31:59.461 --> 32:01.629
All right, all right, all right.

32:03.966 --> 32:06.400
Come on.

32:07.468 --> 32:09.037
And I do want to see paystubs.

32:09.038 --> 32:10.338
Of course you do.

32:10.339 --> 32:11.639
I would, too.

32:11.640 --> 32:14.142
Another wonderful threshold
of intimacy crossed.

32:14.143 --> 32:16.277
Oleg Gruzinsky's job

32:16.278 --> 32:17.445
was to deliver bribes to whoever

32:17.446 --> 32:18.947
President Salnikov was
trying to influence.

32:18.948 --> 32:21.716
But one contact stood out

32:21.717 --> 32:23.618
for Gruzinsky.

32:23.619 --> 32:26.154
He thought a record of that meeting

32:26.155 --> 32:28.122
might serve as a future

32:28.123 --> 32:30.490
insurance policy.

32:33.461 --> 32:36.331
That's Gruzinsky.

32:36.332 --> 32:39.534
I bring greetings from
President Salnikov.

32:39.535 --> 32:41.803
I hope you brought more than greetings.

32:41.804 --> 32:43.271
And the other man?

32:43.272 --> 32:45.373
A candidate in the French
presidential election.

32:45.374 --> 32:46.708
An outlier, running behind.

32:46.709 --> 32:47.842
And running out of money.

32:47.843 --> 32:49.276
Léon Perrin.

32:51.379 --> 32:52.747
Three million euros.

32:52.748 --> 32:54.349
Six more will arrive on Saturday.

32:54.350 --> 32:56.383
More as needed.

33:00.154 --> 33:01.890
You are very generous.

33:01.891 --> 33:04.225
Ah. This is not a gift.

33:04.226 --> 33:07.729
It is an investment in
your future presidency.

33:07.730 --> 33:10.230
We very much look forward
to working with you.

33:11.933 --> 33:16.069
Tell your president he
may call me at any time.

33:18.139 --> 33:21.509
So Perrin made a backroom
deal with the Russians.

33:21.510 --> 33:23.444
Access to the highest office in France

33:23.445 --> 33:26.747
for unlimited campaign financing.

33:28.383 --> 33:32.153
He's been doing the Kremlin's
bidding from day one.

33:32.154 --> 33:33.554
The first 5,000 Russian troops

33:33.555 --> 33:35.390
have just hit the shore in Bulgaria.

33:35.391 --> 33:37.959
So that goes one step
closer to the dream.

33:37.960 --> 33:40.762
It doesn't stop at Bulgaria.

33:40.763 --> 33:43.296
Breaking NATO has
always been the end game.

33:44.666 --> 33:47.068
And it's working.

33:51.555 --> 33:54.012
If the video is as
damning as you say it is,

33:54.013 --> 33:55.080
why not just leak it?

33:55.081 --> 33:57.501
Then Perrin spins it
as American propaganda,

33:57.502 --> 33:59.670
and France spends a week chasing its tail

33:59.671 --> 34:01.438
over whether or not it's authentic.

34:01.439 --> 34:04.243
In which time, Russia
completes its strangulation

34:04.244 --> 34:06.479
of the legitimate government in Bulgaria,

34:06.480 --> 34:07.713
and it's too late.

34:07.714 --> 34:09.348
So you want your old buddy
Mike to leak it for you.

34:09.349 --> 34:11.851
You have the right contacts
in the French media.

34:11.851 --> 34:14.453
And a reputation for discretion.

34:14.454 --> 34:16.589
Ironic, don't you think?

34:16.590 --> 34:18.925
- That I'm the discreet one?
- I beg your pardon.

34:18.926 --> 34:20.393
Never mind.

34:20.393 --> 34:23.728
Something tells me you can
handle the moral ambiguity.

34:23.730 --> 34:26.731
Now are you in, or are you out?

34:30.101 --> 34:32.505
Hey.

34:32.505 --> 34:34.273
Hey.

34:34.274 --> 34:35.608
Do you mind?

34:35.609 --> 34:37.409
Why not?

34:42.915 --> 34:45.250
What's going on?

34:47.085 --> 34:49.054
I know it was you

34:49.056 --> 34:51.223
who did the sleuthing and ran to teacher.

34:51.224 --> 34:53.859
Well, of course it was me.

34:53.860 --> 34:55.828
And if you thought

34:55.829 --> 34:59.231
I might be in the thrall of
some hostile foreign power,

34:59.232 --> 35:01.867
I would hope that you would
go to the secretary, too.

35:01.868 --> 35:03.135
Uh...

35:03.136 --> 35:04.837
All you had to do was ask.

35:04.838 --> 35:06.405
That's all you had to do.

35:06.406 --> 35:08.274
Mike?

35:08.275 --> 35:13.179
My first obligation is to this job.

35:13.180 --> 35:16.082
I get that.

35:16.083 --> 35:19.451
Now if you'll excuse me, I
have to go do some dirty work.

35:24.667 --> 35:26.125
Ma'am?

35:26.126 --> 35:28.160
New language just went through
Ambassador Newman's office.

35:28.161 --> 35:29.962
Including the new troop commitments?

35:29.963 --> 35:31.364
Paragraph seven.

35:31.365 --> 35:33.499
Language gives 40,000
troops of the Response Force,

35:33.500 --> 35:34.781
including air and sea assets,

35:34.782 --> 35:36.902
to the "complete discretion of
the Supreme Allied Commander."

35:36.903 --> 35:38.571
If this passes, we can have deployment

35:38.572 --> 35:39.972
to Bulgaria within the hour.

35:39.973 --> 35:41.173
But?

35:41.174 --> 35:44.377
No word from Beauvais.

35:44.378 --> 35:46.779
I thought she resigned.

35:46.780 --> 35:48.080
She's holding out.

35:48.081 --> 35:50.483
And until Perrin is
officially impeached, she's...

35:50.484 --> 35:52.852
She's free to kill Article 5.

35:52.853 --> 35:54.973
If France abstains,
we'll have the consensus.

35:56.189 --> 35:58.424
I'll make this quick.

35:58.425 --> 36:02.361
The CIA estimates that the last

36:02.362 --> 36:04.530
of the Bulgarian

36:04.531 --> 36:07.099
resistance pockets will collapse

36:07.100 --> 36:09.135
in the next two to three hours.

36:09.136 --> 36:11.270
At which point, their subjugation

36:11.271 --> 36:14.072
to Russia will be complete.

36:22.915 --> 36:25.317
This is a postcard my uncle

36:25.318 --> 36:27.420
sent to his father when

36:27.421 --> 36:29.455
he arrived in Italy.

36:29.456 --> 36:31.991
William Adams.

36:31.992 --> 36:35.494
He was in the third infantry division,

36:35.495 --> 36:37.796
the Battle of Anzio.

36:40.700 --> 36:44.236
"We landed safely yesterday,

36:44.237 --> 36:46.839
"passed the ruins of a school today.

36:46.840 --> 36:51.277
"Kids in gray rags
scrambling over the heap.

36:51.278 --> 36:53.879
"We got out some K rations, but

36:53.880 --> 36:56.549
"no.

36:56.550 --> 37:00.152
"They only wanted to shake our hands.

37:00.153 --> 37:04.189
Greatest feeling of my life."

37:05.391 --> 37:08.060
"Will write to you soon.

37:08.061 --> 37:10.963
Again, my love to Mother." I...

37:10.964 --> 37:13.799
I Nev... I never met my uncle.

37:13.800 --> 37:16.469
He died the next day

37:16.470 --> 37:18.304
at the counter-attack.

37:18.305 --> 37:21.574
But-but the thing
that-that... that strikes me is

37:21.575 --> 37:25.010
this validation of purpose.

37:25.011 --> 37:28.280
The invigoration of-of
fighting for something

37:28.281 --> 37:32.350
greater than himself, for a
future that he believed in.

37:33.352 --> 37:39.390
The certainty that he was
on the right side of history.

37:40.126 --> 37:42.061
It's a feeling that I think

37:42.062 --> 37:43.896
everyone in this room can understand.

37:43.897 --> 37:47.700
It's time to do that again.

37:47.701 --> 37:50.836
The United States asks
the Atlantic Council

37:50.837 --> 37:52.938
to immediately and publicly

37:52.939 --> 37:55.007
declare accord on the resolution.

37:55.008 --> 37:58.043
The Bulgarian people second this motion.

37:58.044 --> 38:01.614
All in favor of invoking Article 5,

38:01.615 --> 38:04.550
according to the terms put forward

38:04.551 --> 38:07.485
in the resolution by the United States?

38:08.921 --> 38:11.857
The Estonian people are
with you, Madam Secretary.

38:11.858 --> 38:13.526
The people of Poland are, too.

38:13.527 --> 38:14.627
Italy stands ready.

38:14.628 --> 38:17.096
The Royal Netherlands
Army stands with you.

38:17.097 --> 38:18.036
The United Kingdom stands with you.

38:18.037 --> 38:19.098
The Canadian Armed Forces are with you.

38:19.099 --> 38:21.467
The proud nation of Portugal is with you.

38:21.468 --> 38:22.735
The Spanish people are with you.

38:22.736 --> 38:23.769
We are in agreement.

38:23.770 --> 38:25.538
The Republic of Turkey
is ready for battle.

38:25.539 --> 38:26.806
The Greek people are with you!

38:26.807 --> 38:27.973
The Federal Republic of Germany

38:27.974 --> 38:28.974
is behind you.

38:28.975 --> 38:30.142
Croatia is with you.

38:30.143 --> 38:32.083
Belgium pledges its military commitment.

38:33.012 --> 38:35.680
The motion rests with France.

38:40.019 --> 38:42.922
The French Republic abstains.

38:42.923 --> 38:45.224
With France abstaining,

38:45.225 --> 38:46.792
all participating
members are in agreement,

38:46.793 --> 38:50.062
and the Article 5 resolution is invoked.

38:50.063 --> 38:55.234
SACEUR now has full authority
to bring NATO forces into combat.

38:55.235 --> 38:58.270
Good job. Good job.

39:06.234 --> 39:09.437
Uh, ma'am, the celebration is underway,

39:09.438 --> 39:13.374
and the staff is tipsily
requesting your presence.

39:13.375 --> 39:14.842
I'm just the messenger.

39:14.843 --> 39:17.111
Also a little tipsy.

39:17.112 --> 39:19.313
Uh, you know what? Save me a glass.

39:19.314 --> 39:21.148
I've got one more thing to do.

39:21.149 --> 39:23.416
Yup.

39:27.055 --> 39:28.923
Minister Avdonin, good evening.

39:28.924 --> 39:30.891
To you, as well, Madam Secretary.

39:30.892 --> 39:34.061
We'll have much more to discuss
in the coming days and weeks,

39:34.062 --> 39:37.198
but the most pressing issue
at hand is the safe return

39:37.199 --> 39:40.101
of the Bulgarian nationals
being held by Russia.

39:40.102 --> 39:42.570
And the Russian nationals
being held by NATO forces.

39:42.571 --> 39:43.904
Return the members

39:43.905 --> 39:46.173
of the Bulgarian
government in your custody

39:46.174 --> 39:47.775
in the next 48 hours,

39:47.776 --> 39:50.578
and NATO will release
your men at the same time.

39:50.579 --> 39:52.413
Is that acceptable to your government?

39:52.414 --> 39:53.748
Yes.

39:53.749 --> 39:55.883
If that is all, Madam Secretary...

39:55.884 --> 39:58.386
No, it's not, Minister Avdonin.

39:58.387 --> 40:01.422
There's someone else we need back.

40:02.924 --> 40:04.625
Ready.

40:04.626 --> 40:06.060
Aim.

40:06.061 --> 40:08.929
Fire.

40:08.930 --> 40:11.098
Ready.

40:11.099 --> 40:12.066
Aim.

40:12.067 --> 40:13.334
Fire.

40:13.335 --> 40:16.303
Present! Hut!

41:08.055 --> 41:10.391
Wake up.

41:10.392 --> 41:11.759
We're here.

41:11.760 --> 41:15.129
We're here!

41:15.130 --> 41:17.198
We're at the cabin.

41:17.199 --> 41:21.202
And democracy's intact.

41:21.203 --> 41:22.970
Yup.

41:22.971 --> 41:24.438
Oh.

41:24.439 --> 41:26.407
You still got a shot at that stamp.

41:28.376 --> 41:31.544
This was a really hard week.

41:32.880 --> 41:35.853
I'm sorry if I wasn't entirely myself.

41:35.854 --> 41:38.255
Yeah, I was meaning to
talk to you about that.

41:38.256 --> 41:39.737
When you're saving the world,

41:39.738 --> 41:41.806
could you be a little
more cheerful, please?

41:45.409 --> 41:49.013
We didn't really save world.

41:49.014 --> 41:52.750
We just...

41:52.751 --> 41:55.052
well, made it okay for now.

41:55.053 --> 41:58.356
Okay for now is a pretty good deal.

41:58.357 --> 42:01.424
Yeah, it is.

42:11.035 --> 42:13.771
Whoa. I remember it bigger.

42:13.772 --> 42:15.639
Are you sure this is it?

42:15.640 --> 42:18.576
Yup. Cabin 12, the very same one.

42:18.577 --> 42:21.212
It'll be cozy on the inside, right?

42:21.213 --> 42:22.713
We're gonna make it cozy.

42:22.714 --> 42:25.015
I'm gonna give you romance
if it kills me, woman.

42:26.718 --> 42:28.586
- What?
- Hey!

42:28.587 --> 42:29.954
- Hey.
- Finally.

42:29.955 --> 42:32.490
- Welcome.
- Ooh, oh, be on my team.

42:32.491 --> 42:33.858
Call it! Call it!

42:33.859 --> 42:35.092
Now, that's romantic.

42:35.093 --> 42:36.560
I do my best.

42:36.561 --> 42:39.897
You guys, I can't believe it.

42:39.898 --> 42:41.298
- Sit down.
- All right, come on, Mom.

42:41.299 --> 42:42.900
- I love this game.
- All right, you're cheating.

42:42.901 --> 42:44.622
- It's my favorite.
- I can tell you're cheating already.

42:44.623 --> 42:45.603
Yeah. Really good job.
