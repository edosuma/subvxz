00:03.653 --> 00:06.986
Charlie? Honey, wake up.

00:09.192 --> 00:11.717
- Good morning.
- You lied to me, Charlie.

00:13.563 --> 00:16.327
You said it was
just going to be the two of us.

00:17.333 --> 00:19.801
I didn't lie, Berta. Things change.

00:20.003 --> 00:21.800
Goodbye, Charlie.

00:23.373 --> 00:24.965
Don't leave me, Berta.

00:26.009 --> 00:27.306
I love you.

00:27.410 --> 00:30.243
- Can't we talk about this?
- Sorry. I do single men only.

00:30.346 --> 00:33.008
I'm in, I'm out, there are no complications.

00:34.317 --> 00:35.648
But I am single.

00:35.719 --> 00:39.177
Berta? I hate to bring this up again,
but you just...

00:39.255 --> 00:42.691
You cannot put the peanut butter
in the refrigerator. It gets hard.

00:43.993 --> 00:46.860
And, on a related subject,
the peanut-butter stains

00:46.930 --> 00:49.763
on Jake's shirts
really require an enzyme presoak.

00:50.734 --> 00:53.328
I hope you two will be
very happy together.

00:54.738 --> 00:56.330
But who's going to take care of me?

00:56.406 --> 00:58.465
Who's going to do the laundry,
the shopping,

00:58.541 --> 01:02.307
- and the cleaning and all the other stuff?
- Ask the Scrubbing Bubble there.

01:05.648 --> 01:07.843
Uncle Charlie, why is Berta leaving?

01:08.084 --> 01:10.348
Why? It doesn't matter, Jake.

01:11.054 --> 01:13.318
What matters is she's gone.

01:15.058 --> 01:16.923
And we're all going to die.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:27.537 --> 01:30.062
She left before she made the coffee.

01:32.142 --> 01:34.133
So? We'll make our own coffee.

01:34.711 --> 01:35.905
How?

01:46.055 --> 01:47.545
So, now we just wait?

01:47.624 --> 01:49.785
Yes. It takes a couple of minutes.

01:53.329 --> 01:55.160
Alan, this goes beyond coffee.

01:55.265 --> 01:58.098
Berta's been with me forever.
She does everything.

01:58.168 --> 02:00.568
She's like a wife that leaves
before you wake up,

02:00.637 --> 02:03.162
and doesn't mind if you sleep around.

02:03.740 --> 02:05.173
Is that the coffee?

02:05.909 --> 02:08.309
It's my peanut butter. I made it soft.

02:09.679 --> 02:13.581
I've been figuring out a way to repay you
for letting me and Jake stay here.

02:13.650 --> 02:16.778
- Why don't I take over the housework?
- Berta did the shopping, too.

02:16.853 --> 02:19.014
- I can do that.
- She did my laundry.

02:19.622 --> 02:20.987
In her way, yes.

02:22.258 --> 02:24.658
But I can handle that, too. And look,

02:25.795 --> 02:28.025
I even made your coffee.

02:28.464 --> 02:29.624
Thank you.

02:32.869 --> 02:33.927
No.

02:35.705 --> 02:37.172
Not as good as Berta's.

02:37.273 --> 02:39.867
It's her coffee. I just pressed the button.

02:41.177 --> 02:44.977
Berta's tasted, I don't know, Christmassy.

02:45.849 --> 02:47.908
What does that mean, "Christmassy?"

02:48.251 --> 02:49.980
It means "like Christmas. "

02:51.087 --> 02:53.021
Now, you got to work with me, Charlie.

02:53.122 --> 02:55.920
I mean, nutmeg, cinnamon,
powdered reindeer?

02:56.492 --> 02:58.653
I don't know.
It's just that when you drank it,

02:58.761 --> 03:01.594
it felt like Christmas morning,
and anything was possible.

03:02.498 --> 03:05.990
Sweet'N Low? Half & Half? Mocha Mix?

03:06.269 --> 03:08.430
Forget it. I'll just read my paper.

03:11.207 --> 03:12.606
Where's my paper?

03:12.675 --> 03:15.337
I don't know.
You might try looking by the front door.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.777
No, it's usually right here, on the table.

03:17.847 --> 03:22.216
Okay, so before you got up, Berta started
the coffee and got you your paper?

03:22.318 --> 03:25.287
I don't know the mechanics of it,
but, yeah.

03:25.655 --> 03:27.179
I'll go get it.

03:30.059 --> 03:32.493
He's not off to a very good start.

03:34.230 --> 03:36.061
Want a glass of peanut butter?

03:55.151 --> 03:56.709
- Alan?
- Yeah?

03:56.920 --> 03:58.512
I can see you.

04:00.089 --> 04:01.886
And I can see you, too.

04:05.028 --> 04:07.929
No. I mean, Berta never cleaned
when I was in the room.

04:08.031 --> 04:09.862
She was like invisible.

04:09.933 --> 04:12.595
I'm sorry. I'll try to be more transparent.

04:13.269 --> 04:14.736
Appreciate it.

04:21.844 --> 04:23.072
Oh, no.

04:23.546 --> 04:24.740
I see you.

04:24.847 --> 04:26.474
Give me a break.

04:27.216 --> 04:30.242
Not you. That girl that's been stalking me.

04:30.720 --> 04:31.982
Rose?

04:33.690 --> 04:35.248
There you are.

04:36.059 --> 04:38.550
What are you doing
sneaking up on me like that?

04:40.196 --> 04:41.720
Rose, honey,

04:42.231 --> 04:45.223
we spent one night together,
and it was very nice, but...

04:45.335 --> 04:47.326
What is your favorite part?

04:48.671 --> 04:52.505
Gee, I'd have to say, finding out you live
just two doors down.

04:53.609 --> 04:57.375
Sometimes, it's all I can do not to chew
through that house in the middle.

04:58.614 --> 04:59.774
Yeah.

05:00.450 --> 05:03.283
But see, I'm not looking for
a relationship right now.

05:03.386 --> 05:07.846
So, maybe you should find someone
who can give you the attention you want.

05:08.424 --> 05:10.085
Need, deserve,

05:10.727 --> 05:12.058
require.

05:14.297 --> 05:16.356
Are you saying we should see
other people?

05:16.432 --> 05:17.956
Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.

05:18.067 --> 05:21.969
You have so much love to give,
and somewhere out there is a guy who

05:22.805 --> 05:24.204
can take it.

05:25.241 --> 05:28.335
- Well, there is this one guy...
- He sounds perfect.

05:30.013 --> 05:32.948
His name is Andy.
He works at Jamba Juice.

05:33.049 --> 05:37.179
He always gives me a free wheatgrass
shooter and chuckles when I gag.

05:38.421 --> 05:39.752
Then ask him out.

05:39.856 --> 05:42.086
That seems kind of forward,
don't you think?

05:42.191 --> 05:44.853
No, come on,
women ask guys out all the time.

05:44.961 --> 05:47.452
What they don't do
is handcuff themselves

05:47.563 --> 05:50.691
to the refrigerator,
when he says it's time to go home.

05:51.901 --> 05:54.768
That's where you and I
went off the track, isn't it?

05:56.039 --> 05:59.440
I'm the past. Andy's the future.

06:00.043 --> 06:02.876
Bye-bye now. Good luck,

06:03.546 --> 06:05.036
Andy.

06:21.264 --> 06:22.595
Alan?

06:23.299 --> 06:26.268
- What did you do to my piano?
- Nothing. I just dusted.

06:26.335 --> 06:30.396
Yes, well, I'm sitting here trying
to write a jingle about a chocolate bar

06:30.473 --> 06:32.839
and my piano smells like lemons.

06:33.076 --> 06:36.341
Gee, I'm sorry, Charlie.
But they don't make chocolate Pledge.

06:37.447 --> 06:39.472
Maybe I'm not making myself clear.

06:39.582 --> 06:42.847
The rest of the house can smell like
any fruit you want.

06:44.420 --> 06:46.854
But my piano needs to smell...

06:47.290 --> 06:49.190
- Piano-y.
- There you go.

06:49.959 --> 06:52.450
Fine. I'll get an unscented polish.

06:52.762 --> 06:55.424
That's not going to help me now, is it?

06:56.933 --> 06:58.298
Nope.

06:58.401 --> 07:02.462
You know what? You are a child.
You're a big, high-maintenance child.

07:02.605 --> 07:04.596
I am not a child.

07:05.174 --> 07:06.334
Where you going?

07:06.442 --> 07:09.900
If I can't write my chocolate song,
I'm going to take a nap.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.518
Charlie, you asleep?

07:21.757 --> 07:23.952
I'm doing a load of whites.

08:12.008 --> 08:13.373
Jeez!

08:14.043 --> 08:15.806
- Charlie?
- What?

08:15.878 --> 08:17.812
You kicked me in your sleep.

08:17.880 --> 08:19.711
Who said I was asleep?

08:20.349 --> 08:22.544
I can't do this anymore.
You are impossible.

08:22.652 --> 08:25.314
Don't blame me. I tried to make it work.

08:25.388 --> 08:27.549
Excuse me? Berta quit at 9:00.

08:27.657 --> 08:30.683
It's now 2:30. When did you try?
Where was the trying?

08:31.060 --> 08:33.289
You're the one who made Berta quit.

08:33.361 --> 08:34.919
I didn't make her quit.

08:34.996 --> 08:37.124
I simply raised the bar
of quality housework

08:37.200 --> 08:39.532
and she insisted on limboing under it.

08:39.802 --> 08:42.134
But since you obviously
can't live without her,

08:42.205 --> 08:45.504
you big baby,
I will go apologize and get her back.

08:45.575 --> 08:47.338
- Great.
- So, where does she live?

08:51.047 --> 08:52.571
I don't know.

08:53.182 --> 08:55.241
Okay. What's her last name?

08:58.421 --> 09:01.720
Your entire life depends on this woman
and you know nothing about her.

09:01.824 --> 09:03.086
Wait.

09:03.926 --> 09:05.553
She took a bus.

09:06.829 --> 09:08.558
I stand corrected.

09:10.032 --> 09:13.433
After she works here in the morning,
she cleans some rock star's house.

09:13.536 --> 09:15.697
Okay, what rock star? Where?

09:16.439 --> 09:20.432
Steven Tyler from Aerosmith.
4456 Malibu Canyon Road.

09:22.745 --> 09:24.178
Thank you.

09:25.114 --> 09:29.244
Now listen, Judith is coming by at 5:00 to
pick up Jake for dinner with her parents.

09:29.318 --> 09:30.615
Now I should be back by then.

09:30.686 --> 09:33.086
But you need to make sure
he's dressed and ready to go.

09:33.189 --> 09:35.453
- No problem.
- No, it's a problem, Charlie.

09:35.524 --> 09:37.856
I'm trying desperately
to reconcile with my wife,

09:37.927 --> 09:39.519
so I don't want to tick her off.

09:39.595 --> 09:42.257
So, you telling me, "It's no problem,"
does not reassure me.

09:42.365 --> 09:45.425
Here. Take my sock.
I want to show you a trick.

09:48.704 --> 09:51.867
I'll go get Berta.
You make sure Jake is ready.

09:53.209 --> 09:56.144
- Hi.
- Hello.

09:56.245 --> 09:59.237
There are security cameras out front,
so come up from the back,

09:59.315 --> 10:02.648
and bring some dog treats,
in case the rottweilers are out.

10:04.887 --> 10:07.048
Again, thank you.

10:10.993 --> 10:13.461
I asked Andy out, and he said yes.

10:13.896 --> 10:17.332
- Andy?
- That guy you told me to ask out.

10:17.833 --> 10:19.562
I just don't know what to wear.

10:19.635 --> 10:22.468
I love this one,
but it still smells like pepper spray.

10:25.308 --> 10:27.139
Where are you going?

10:27.610 --> 10:29.771
To roll around naked on your bed.

10:31.781 --> 10:34.773
I'm just kidding.
I'm going to try on the dress, silly.

10:34.850 --> 10:36.477
But...

10:37.820 --> 10:40.653
- Is that lady your girlfriend?
- No, she's just...

10:41.524 --> 10:43.287
It's complicated.

10:46.562 --> 10:50.328
- What the hell happened to you?
- You know what else is complicated?

10:50.399 --> 10:51.798
Fractions.

10:52.468 --> 10:54.834
You got grease all over you.

10:55.538 --> 10:57.403
It's in your hair, man.

10:57.740 --> 11:01.232
Yes. My bike chain broke. Can you fix it?

11:02.011 --> 11:04.309
Kid, I'm a piano player. What do you think?

11:05.514 --> 11:08.540
Look, your mom's going to be here soon
to take you to dinner.

11:08.651 --> 11:09.913
I know.

11:10.019 --> 11:12.419
- So, how about a shower?
- No, thank you.

11:13.222 --> 11:15.053
That wasn't a question.

11:20.096 --> 11:22.394
Sorry, pal, but you need a shower.

11:22.465 --> 11:25.434
But my bike's still broken.
I think you made it worse.

11:25.534 --> 11:28.401
What are you talking about?
Now you got a unicycle.

11:28.471 --> 11:30.098
Get in the shower.

11:32.541 --> 11:36.443
- I'm so worried he's not going to like me.
- He's going to love you, Rose.

11:36.545 --> 11:39.878
Just go out, have a great time,
and don't come on too strong.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.281
Me, too strong? What do you mean?

11:43.252 --> 11:45.243
Okay, speaking from my own experience,

11:45.321 --> 11:48.347
there's nothing wrong with asking a guy
for a blood test,

11:48.424 --> 11:51.552
but trying to take the blood yourself
is a little strong.

11:51.961 --> 11:54.555
- I see.
- Where you going now?

11:55.231 --> 11:58.223
You got me thinking
this dress comes on too strong.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.894
So, I'm going to put on something
a little less...

12:00.970 --> 12:02.835
And a little more...

12:07.276 --> 12:09.972
Jake, why aren't you in the shower?

12:11.347 --> 12:12.712
Oh, yeah.

12:26.996 --> 12:30.488
Hi, Berta. It's me, the Scrubbing Bubble.

12:31.867 --> 12:33.698
I came to apologize.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.997
Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye.

12:36.338 --> 12:39.466
Come on, can't we put aside
our petty differences

12:39.542 --> 12:44.036
and find a way to work together
out of a mutual love for Charlie?

12:44.246 --> 12:46.874
Yeah, that's why I do this. For love.

12:47.183 --> 12:51.381
The thing is, I'm going through
a really tough time right now.

12:51.487 --> 12:54.752
My marriage is collapsing,
my business is slow.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.189
My little boy is being dragged
back and forth

12:57.259 --> 12:59.386
from his mother's house to Malibu.

12:59.495 --> 13:02.794
My alcoholic husband ran off
with my daughter's parole officer,

13:02.865 --> 13:05.766
and I clean rich peoples' toilets for a living.

13:06.135 --> 13:08.626
Okay, let's not make this a competition.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.534
Jake, you've been in there for a while.
How's it going?

13:16.612 --> 13:17.909
Good.

13:26.121 --> 13:27.986
What are you doing?

13:28.090 --> 13:30.820
Washing my bike chain. It's real dirty.

13:31.093 --> 13:32.583
Forget about the chain.

13:32.661 --> 13:35.494
You got to take a shower
before your mother gets here.

13:42.771 --> 13:45.103
We're going to need a new chain.

13:50.646 --> 13:52.807
Hello, Charlie's house. May I help you?

13:52.915 --> 13:55.941
Hi, Alan, it's Rose. I got in. How'd you do?

13:56.952 --> 13:58.613
Here he is.

13:58.687 --> 14:01.019
- It's your brother.
- Thank you.

14:06.195 --> 14:08.026
How's it going? Did you talk to Berta?

14:08.464 --> 14:10.125
Yes, I'm here with her now.

14:10.199 --> 14:12.292
- Is Jake ready?
- Yes.

14:12.368 --> 14:15.030
We're just applying the finishing touches.

14:17.706 --> 14:20.971
- What about Berta?
- The same. Finishing touches.

14:21.043 --> 14:23.170
She's really a delight.

14:26.181 --> 14:29.412
Just make sure Jake is ready
when Judith gets there.

14:29.718 --> 14:32.812
Relax. Everything's under control.
I got to go.

14:34.657 --> 14:37.421
- So, you like this dress better?
- Hang on, Rose.

14:37.526 --> 14:39.858
The kid's running around the deck
in his underwear.

14:39.929 --> 14:42.864
Sure. But when I do it, you just ignore me.

14:43.532 --> 14:46.433
- Jake, what are you doing?
- Air drying.

14:46.735 --> 14:49.226
You still have grease in your hair.
Didn't you wash it?

14:49.338 --> 14:51.363
You didn't say to wash my hair.

14:52.074 --> 14:54.736
- Wash your hair.
- Okay.

14:57.446 --> 14:59.414
You didn't tell him to rinse.

15:00.382 --> 15:02.407
Good, that's good. Thank you.

15:03.218 --> 15:04.708
Jake, rinse!

15:06.021 --> 15:07.716
All right, so you won't come back.

15:07.790 --> 15:10.918
Will you at least tell me how you made
the damn coffee Christmassy?

15:11.026 --> 15:12.084
Christmassy?

15:12.161 --> 15:14.391
Yeah, Charlie said
your coffee tastes Christmassy.

15:14.463 --> 15:17.057
- Cinnamon.
- I said cinnamon.

15:19.868 --> 15:21.927
Lower back? You do a lot of lifting?

15:23.405 --> 15:26.533
Of course you do.
You're a maid, and I'm an ass.

15:26.775 --> 15:28.436
- I'm a housekeeper.
- Of course.

15:28.510 --> 15:31.411
- And you're an ass.
- Yes.

15:32.081 --> 15:34.515
Why don't you sit down,
let me take a look at it?

15:34.617 --> 15:36.778
- What?
- I'm a chiropractor.

15:37.920 --> 15:40.150
Okay. But no funny business.

15:42.391 --> 15:43.915
Not to worry.

15:47.429 --> 15:50.262
Looks like you washed
your hair instead of mine.

15:52.835 --> 15:54.962
I'm not in the mood, Jake.

15:55.971 --> 15:58.132
These clothes look stupid.

15:58.273 --> 16:00.366
You're 10. No one cares.

16:01.744 --> 16:04.212
- You're choking me.
- Trust me.

16:04.346 --> 16:06.837
You'll know when I'm choking you.

16:07.383 --> 16:10.216
I think my socks are on the wrong feet.

16:10.452 --> 16:12.943
Jake, dude, I'm right on the edge.

16:15.557 --> 16:17.149
Don't push me.

16:19.194 --> 16:21.219
I can't do this on someone else.

16:21.497 --> 16:23.897
- Charlie?
- You look great, Rose.

16:25.668 --> 16:28.193
I don't think I can go through with this.

16:28.270 --> 16:31.262
What? No. Sure you can.

16:31.373 --> 16:35.173
- No, I'm going to call Andy and cancel.
- No, you're not. Now listen to me.

16:35.244 --> 16:38.270
You're a wonderful woman.
And this guy, Andy, is going to love you.

16:38.380 --> 16:41.281
Thanks, but you're saying that
just to get me out of your hair.

16:41.383 --> 16:43.010
No, not just.

16:46.789 --> 16:49.383
- Now go out and have a great time.
- But...

16:50.292 --> 16:53.728
No goodbyes.
Just turn around and walk away.

16:54.430 --> 16:55.863
Okay.

16:57.066 --> 16:58.328
Goodbye.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.730
Goodbye, Rose.

17:09.578 --> 17:12.741
- What happened?
- I have to go to the bathroom.

17:12.981 --> 17:15.175
Why did you take your clothes off?

17:15.284 --> 17:16.979
Sometimes, I miss.

17:18.787 --> 17:22.244
Okay. That's it. I give up.

17:23.092 --> 17:25.526
You are a child, Jake.

17:27.128 --> 17:30.428
Dress, don't dress. Wash, don't wash.

17:30.599 --> 17:32.760
I don't care. You're on your own.

17:34.970 --> 17:36.267
What?

17:40.342 --> 17:43.209
God, that feels so good.

17:44.613 --> 17:47.207
Berta, I can't find my...

17:50.018 --> 17:52.782
Berta, if you're going to do a guy
in the laundry room,

17:52.855 --> 17:55.380
put a scarf on the doorknob or something.

17:57.726 --> 17:59.318
I'm a big fan.

18:04.233 --> 18:05.825
Is Jake ready?

18:06.368 --> 18:07.892
Where's Jake?

18:10.005 --> 18:11.131
I don't know.

18:11.206 --> 18:13.504
You don't know?
My wife just pulled in behind me.

18:13.575 --> 18:16.908
- You said you'd have him ready.
- It can't be done.

18:17.880 --> 18:19.711
What do you mean, it can't be done?

18:20.349 --> 18:22.340
I'm not strong enough.

18:23.886 --> 18:26.252
His will is greater than mine.

18:28.190 --> 18:31.216
I'm just going to get drunk
and stay out of his way.

18:34.263 --> 18:37.255
Please tell me he's ready.
My parents are driving me nuts.

18:37.432 --> 18:39.024
Well...

18:39.368 --> 18:40.733
Hi, Mom.

18:40.869 --> 18:43.099
Don't you look handsome?

18:44.306 --> 18:47.707
- Uncle Charlie took my tie.
- You don't need a tie.

18:50.245 --> 18:51.974
Grow up, Charlie.

18:52.714 --> 18:53.942
Bye.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.912
- I thought you said he beat you?
- He did.

18:58.821 --> 19:00.812
Now he's just screwing with me.

19:03.759 --> 19:05.386
What happened with Berta?

19:05.460 --> 19:08.293
It wasn't easy, but I did it.

19:09.264 --> 19:12.097
She won't do my laundry,
or get my groceries,

19:12.267 --> 19:15.395
and I have to give her
a lower back adjustment twice a week.

19:16.271 --> 19:18.603
And Steven Tyler thinks I'm doing her.

19:21.677 --> 19:25.477
- But she is coming back?
- Yes, Charlie, she is coming back.

19:27.783 --> 19:29.148
Right on.

19:32.788 --> 19:34.380
Are you crying?

19:37.159 --> 19:40.151
It's been a very emotional day.

19:43.365 --> 19:46.163
Here you go, buddy. Drink your vodka.

20:05.320 --> 20:07.686
You look great, Rose, I swear.

20:09.057 --> 20:10.615
He stood me up.

20:10.893 --> 20:14.226
What? After we spent all day
getting ready?

20:17.432 --> 20:20.458
- I don't know what I did wrong.
- You didn't do anything wrong.

20:20.569 --> 20:23.868
- Then why did he stand me up?
- Because he's an idiot.

20:23.939 --> 20:27.739
He doesn't get
what a truly rare person you are.

20:28.243 --> 20:29.574
Thanks.

20:30.145 --> 20:32.773
I wish Randy could see what you see.

20:32.948 --> 20:36.281
Forget about him. Come on,
I'm going to take you to dinner.

20:36.351 --> 20:38.751
- Really?
- Yeah, sure, why not?

20:47.129 --> 20:49.620
I thought you said his name was Andy.

20:49.698 --> 20:51.325
What did I say?

20:52.501 --> 20:55.902
- You said Randy.
- No, I didn't.

20:56.505 --> 20:58.973
Andy's a real guy. I didn't make him up.

21:00.342 --> 21:02.333
I love your little tie.

21:31.406 --> 21:32.600
