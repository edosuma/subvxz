WEBVTT

00:04.569 --> 00:07.311
No, we were gonna end this, Sam.
Like you said.

00:07.355 --> 00:08.791
We're gonna be free.

00:10.619 --> 00:12.664
To perform this spell,
I have to die.

00:12.708 --> 00:15.885
It has to be you
that kills me.

00:15.928 --> 00:17.408
You didn't have a choice.

00:17.452 --> 00:19.106
I'm pissed.

00:19.149 --> 00:21.108
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let
some glorified fanboy

00:21.151 --> 00:22.805
get the last word.

00:22.848 --> 00:24.720
Oh, no.
Oh, Becky.

00:24.763 --> 00:27.070
I am your number-one fan.

00:27.114 --> 00:29.551
I'm samlicker81.

00:29.594 --> 00:31.205
Sam: So you dosed me
with love potion.

00:31.248 --> 00:33.207
It wasn't all bad, right?

00:33.250 --> 00:35.600
Uh, Becky, would you excuse us
for just a second?

00:35.644 --> 00:36.732
Uh-huh.

00:36.775 --> 00:38.168
Amara,
we belong together.

00:38.212 --> 00:41.084
You're not complete.
You're not at full strength.

00:41.128 --> 00:43.565
You can't
leave this world.

00:43.608 --> 00:47.047
You're trapped, diminished,
abandoned.

01:54.244 --> 01:55.898
Man: Next to me.
Back up! Back up!

02:26.798 --> 02:27.756
Benny?

02:27.799 --> 02:29.975
Dean.
Hey.

02:30.019 --> 02:33.457
Dean.Hey, you're gonna be okay.

02:33.501 --> 02:35.503
Naw...

02:35.546 --> 02:38.593
I'm not.

02:38.636 --> 02:40.290
I...

02:40.334 --> 02:43.511
I'll see you on the other side,
brother.

02:44.816 --> 02:46.296
Benny...

02:48.429 --> 02:49.517
Benny.

03:06.316 --> 03:07.665
Where is he?

03:07.709 --> 03:09.232
He's closer than you think.

03:09.276 --> 03:10.581
Where?!

03:10.625 --> 03:12.496
Maybe I'll tell you.

03:12.540 --> 03:13.671
Right before
I rip out your --

03:37.391 --> 03:39.480
He was right.

03:39.523 --> 03:43.048
Closer than you think.

03:43.092 --> 03:44.267
Sam?

03:44.311 --> 03:46.530
You know, I knew
you'd come looking for me.

03:46.574 --> 03:49.577
After Sioux Falls...

03:49.620 --> 03:51.796
I suppose you had to.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.016
What you did to them...

03:54.059 --> 03:56.453
what you did to Bobby...

03:56.497 --> 03:57.280
to Jody...

03:57.324 --> 03:59.674
They tried to stop me.

03:59.717 --> 04:03.243
But I will not
be stopped.

04:05.897 --> 04:08.117
Sam, you listen to me.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.293
This is
the demon blood.

04:10.337 --> 04:12.339
You have to fight it!

04:13.340 --> 04:15.516
Why would I do that?

04:26.962 --> 04:30.313
Sammy, please...

04:30.357 --> 04:31.532
Please.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.485
Morning.

05:11.528 --> 05:12.573
Morning.

05:12.616 --> 05:14.401
Rough night?

05:14.444 --> 05:16.925
Yeah, just, uh...

05:16.968 --> 05:19.710
weird dreams.

05:19.754 --> 05:21.233
Yeah, been there.

05:21.277 --> 05:24.367
Why don't you eat something?
You'll feel better.

05:24.411 --> 05:25.803
Dean, you know
I don't eat --

05:25.847 --> 05:27.718
It's veggie bacon.

05:27.762 --> 05:29.154
What?You've been asking for it.

05:29.198 --> 05:32.506
Yeah. But every time
I ask for it, you say,

05:32.549 --> 05:36.466
and I'm quoting, "I don't want
any of that hippie,

05:36.510 --> 05:38.163
Sarah McLaughlin
grass-eater crap

05:38.207 --> 05:39.991
in the Meat Man's
kitchen."

05:40.035 --> 05:41.906
Which, by the way,
for what it's worth,

05:41.950 --> 05:45.257
you got to stop calling yourself
"The Meat Man."

05:45.301 --> 05:47.782
It -- It doesn't mean
what you think it means.

05:51.002 --> 05:52.526
Yeah, it does.

05:52.569 --> 05:55.355
Anyway, it's not that bad.
Give it a shot.

05:55.398 --> 05:57.922
I'm good.

05:59.837 --> 06:01.535
No, you're not.

06:01.578 --> 06:04.320
The past few days, you've barely
come outta your room.

06:09.847 --> 06:13.547
Look, man,
I get it, okay?

06:13.590 --> 06:16.419
With Jack...

06:16.463 --> 06:18.726
and Rowena...

06:22.338 --> 06:24.819
Rowena knew what she was
getting herself into.

06:24.862 --> 06:28.039
She knew
what needed to be done.

06:28.083 --> 06:30.738
Doesn't make it
any easier.

06:30.781 --> 06:32.566
No, it doesn't.

06:40.182 --> 06:42.184
Here.

06:42.227 --> 06:44.447
In the last month,
Beaverdale, Iowa,

06:44.491 --> 06:46.667
has seen more than a half-dozen
cattle mutilations.

06:46.710 --> 06:48.495
So, what, mountain lion,
or --

06:48.538 --> 06:50.497
Mm. Three days ago,

06:50.540 --> 06:53.543
a girl's body showed up --
ripped to pieces.

06:53.587 --> 06:55.850
Now, local badges think
they've got themselves

06:55.893 --> 06:57.765
a psycho on their hands,
but, I mean,

06:57.808 --> 07:01.856
come on, man, that sounds
exactly like our thing.

07:01.899 --> 07:04.119
So let's go
check it out.

07:05.425 --> 07:09.037
You know, Dean, you can
handle this on your own,

07:09.080 --> 07:10.647
or -- or call up
some of the other hunters --

07:10.691 --> 07:13.128
No, no.
You and me.

07:14.129 --> 07:16.392
Sam, we need this.

07:24.922 --> 07:28.578
That -- That's real bacon, Dean.

07:28.622 --> 07:31.494
You're damn right it is.

07:31.538 --> 07:32.539
Meat Man!

07:37.282 --> 07:39.546
Bailey:
Yeah, watch the bikes.

07:39.589 --> 07:42.679
Davis, use a crosswalk.

07:42.723 --> 07:45.116
Let's go!
Keep it moving!

07:45.160 --> 07:47.031
So...

07:47.075 --> 07:48.729
...our victim...

07:48.772 --> 07:50.034
Susie Martin.
Yeah.

07:50.078 --> 07:52.123
What happened to her,
I can't even imagine.

07:52.167 --> 07:54.517
The police said
she was last seen here.

07:54.561 --> 07:55.866
After cheer practice.

07:55.910 --> 07:58.303
And the, uh,
security cameras?

07:58.347 --> 08:00.610
Uh, the police checked
but nothing.

08:00.654 --> 08:01.785
Was she close to anyone?

08:01.829 --> 08:03.526
Susie was close
to everyone.

08:03.570 --> 08:05.746
She was part of the drama club,
debate team,

08:05.789 --> 08:08.313
cheerleading, campus ministry --
you name it.

08:08.357 --> 08:10.228
Any best friends?

08:10.272 --> 08:12.753
Mostly Veronica
and the girls.

08:12.796 --> 08:14.668
They're putting together
a prayer vigil for her.

08:14.711 --> 08:16.583
Excuse me, Mrs. Bailey?

08:16.626 --> 08:18.759
Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Whitman,
how can I help you?

08:18.802 --> 08:20.630
Well, it's just --
we heard a rumor

08:20.674 --> 08:22.719
that the game is gonna be
cancelled this Friday?

08:22.763 --> 08:25.679
Oh, not canceled, rescheduled --
for the service.

08:25.722 --> 08:29.204
For Susie.Right. And we're so sorry
about what happened to her.

08:29.247 --> 08:32.512
I mean, it's just
so, so horrible, but...

08:32.555 --> 08:36.690
Uh, we had a scout coming to
that game for Billy --

08:36.733 --> 08:38.561
from Yale.

08:38.605 --> 08:41.738
A young lady is dead, and you're
worried about a football game?

08:41.782 --> 08:43.566
It's lacrosse.

08:43.610 --> 08:44.611
Who are you?

08:44.654 --> 08:46.395
Agent Plant, FBI.

08:46.438 --> 08:47.744
Oh.

08:47.788 --> 08:49.746
It's just,  Yale's
Billy's first choice,

08:49.790 --> 08:53.576
and if he doesn't get in,
it'll be the end of the world.

08:53.620 --> 08:56.884
Actually, the end of the world
is the end of the world.

08:56.927 --> 08:59.408
Of course.Of course.

08:59.451 --> 09:01.323
But maybe you could
have the --

09:01.366 --> 09:03.325
the little prayer thing
at halftime?

09:03.368 --> 09:04.456
Or --
No.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.459
Well, is --
No.

09:07.503 --> 09:10.071
I see.

09:10.114 --> 09:12.987
Well...
thank you for your time.

09:17.078 --> 09:19.515
I swear, the parents
are worse than the kids.

09:24.302 --> 09:26.609
Hey.
Any luck at the morgue?

09:30.831 --> 09:32.528
Is that a...?
Vamp fang.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.877
Vampires
drain their victims.

09:33.921 --> 09:35.618
Vamps don't
rip their bodies apart.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.664
Apparently, this one does.
And it gets a little weirder.

09:37.707 --> 09:39.970
Coroner said that there were
no sign of defensive wounds,

09:40.014 --> 09:41.711
so it's like
she didn't even fight.

09:41.755 --> 09:44.584
So whoever killed her,
maybe it was someone she knew.

09:44.627 --> 09:46.760
And according to
the vice principal,

09:46.803 --> 09:49.066
she kind of knew everyone.

09:49.110 --> 09:51.895
Oh, that's awesome.

09:55.812 --> 09:57.684
That's awesome.

09:57.727 --> 09:59.642
Ha!

10:00.948 --> 10:02.558
You see that beaver?

10:05.169 --> 10:07.998
I know. Cheer practice
was so long, right?

10:08.042 --> 10:10.261
I swear, Veronica's so fake.

10:10.305 --> 10:11.654
"I'm lost without Susie.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.221
It's like a piece of my heart
is gone."

10:13.264 --> 10:15.832
Gag me.

10:15.876 --> 10:18.530
Okay, yeah. Later.

10:37.419 --> 10:41.162
So, this is where
they found Susie's body?

10:41.205 --> 10:42.859
Yeah.
You notice what's missing?

10:42.903 --> 10:44.252
Blood.

10:44.295 --> 10:46.863
So, how does a freak gut a girl
and not make a mess?

10:46.907 --> 10:50.127
By killing her somewhere else
and dumping her here.

10:50.171 --> 10:51.825
Looks like.
Yeah. Great.

10:51.868 --> 10:53.565
Well,
local police are freaked.

10:53.609 --> 10:57.221
Never seen anything like this.
They got no idea how to deal.

10:57.265 --> 10:59.006
Of course not.

10:59.049 --> 11:02.313
That's our job.

11:02.357 --> 11:04.838
We keep them from
dealing with the truth,

11:04.881 --> 11:07.797
with what's out there,
and we carry the weight.

11:07.841 --> 11:09.016
It's great.

11:09.059 --> 11:11.714
Meanwhile, they get to
go back to living in

11:11.758 --> 11:15.239
their white picket fence
bubbles.

11:15.283 --> 11:17.764
You know,
ever since you were a kid,

11:17.807 --> 11:19.374
you wanted to live
in a town like this.

11:19.417 --> 11:22.377
Lame, normal...

11:22.420 --> 11:24.640
Yeah,
we don't get normal.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.512
And these towns, everything's
the end of the world.

11:27.556 --> 11:28.992
You're late for work,

11:29.036 --> 11:30.733
your kid doesn't get into
the right school -- whatever.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.822
They don't...

11:35.390 --> 11:37.697
They have no idea
what's out there.

11:43.790 --> 11:45.487
Huh.

11:45.530 --> 11:47.750
Vice Principal
Bailey?

11:47.794 --> 11:49.926
Yes.

11:49.970 --> 11:51.711
Really?

11:51.754 --> 11:54.583
Of course,
uh, on our way.

11:55.584 --> 11:57.934
We got another one.

12:01.938 --> 12:03.766
Seat belts, seat belts.

12:03.810 --> 12:04.985
Okay.

12:05.028 --> 12:07.770
We know, Dad.

12:07.814 --> 12:10.294
Got this, got that,
got that.

12:10.338 --> 12:13.384
You're forgetting
something.

12:13.428 --> 12:16.474
Motion-sickness pills --
for Junior.

12:16.518 --> 12:18.999
He would've been fine, babe.
It's just Lake Michigan.

12:19.042 --> 12:21.305
Hardly any chop.Four hours in a boat?

12:21.349 --> 12:23.438
Rod Jr. gets seasick
in the tub.

12:23.481 --> 12:24.918
Where would I be
without you?

12:24.961 --> 12:26.136
Covered in puke.

12:27.398 --> 12:28.486
Have fun, sweeties!

12:28.530 --> 12:30.358
Thanks, Mom, we will.

12:30.401 --> 12:33.013
Wow.
Felt that.

12:33.056 --> 12:34.623
You can't wait to
have the house to yourself.

12:34.666 --> 12:36.625
Oh, you have no idea.

12:40.542 --> 12:42.413
-Bye, Mom!
-Bye!

12:42.457 --> 12:44.764
Rod Jr.: Bye, Mom!

12:52.989 --> 12:54.817
Becky, wait!

12:54.861 --> 12:56.340
Becky, please.

12:56.384 --> 12:57.951
Becky, please wait.

12:57.994 --> 12:59.691
What are you doing here?

12:59.735 --> 13:01.998
I just -- I wanted to --
I needed to see you.

13:02.042 --> 13:04.522
Well, I don't want
or need to see you.

13:04.566 --> 13:07.090
I'm sorry, I --

13:07.134 --> 13:08.570
I know we're not together
anymore,

13:08.613 --> 13:11.051
and it seems like
you're doing great.

13:11.094 --> 13:13.836
I just -- I --
I wanted to talk.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.707
Catch up.

13:15.751 --> 13:17.144
It's been a rough
couple of weeks.

13:17.187 --> 13:18.928
That's not my problem.

13:18.972 --> 13:20.712
Wait, Becky, please.

13:20.756 --> 13:23.280
I don't have
anywhere else to go.

13:25.848 --> 13:28.242
Tori Taylor
never came home last night.

13:28.285 --> 13:29.721
She was talking to a friend
on the phone,

13:29.765 --> 13:32.159
in the parking lot,
and then...gone.

13:32.202 --> 13:33.421
What about her vehicle?

13:33.464 --> 13:34.857
It's still there,
which is --

13:34.901 --> 13:35.989
Not good.

13:36.032 --> 13:38.513
Her parents are worried sick.
They --

13:38.556 --> 13:40.515
Do you think
she and Susie --Let's start with this.

13:40.558 --> 13:42.691
The girls, did they have
anything in common?

13:45.215 --> 13:47.261
They're both
cheerleaders.

13:47.304 --> 13:49.959
Well,
somebody's got a fetish.

13:50.003 --> 13:51.787
Excuse me?

13:54.094 --> 13:55.312
I, uh --

13:55.356 --> 13:57.575
We'll look into it.

14:06.106 --> 14:07.498
What are these?

14:07.542 --> 14:09.283
Becky: My maquettes.

14:09.326 --> 14:11.894
You...make them?

14:11.938 --> 14:14.027
I run the most successful
Etsy site

14:14.070 --> 14:17.073
for unofficial "Supernatural"
merchandise in the country.

14:17.117 --> 14:19.206
Probably the world.

14:19.249 --> 14:20.772
Wow.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.905
So you're still, um...

14:22.949 --> 14:23.993
Still what?

14:24.037 --> 14:25.995
Uh,
obsessed with my work.

14:26.039 --> 14:28.389
You mean my work.

14:28.432 --> 14:31.261
Look, what you were writing,
it was real --

14:31.305 --> 14:33.089
like, really real.

14:33.133 --> 14:35.265
You sort of channeled
Sam and Dean's lives

14:35.309 --> 14:36.440
because you're a prophet.

14:36.484 --> 14:38.965
I...Yeah.
Yes, I am.

14:39.008 --> 14:41.489
And, sure,
I got a little obsessed,

14:41.532 --> 14:44.579
and it took me
to a dark place.

14:46.015 --> 14:48.235
What I did to Sam...

14:49.889 --> 14:53.066
So, after some pretty intensive
counseling,

14:53.109 --> 14:57.461
I realized I wasn't in love
with the real Sam Winchester.

14:57.505 --> 15:00.943
I loved his character.

15:00.987 --> 15:02.640
So instead of
reading your stories,

15:02.684 --> 15:03.859
I kept writing my own.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.035
Your own...
"Supernatural"?

15:06.079 --> 15:09.256
Where the guys didn't have to
hunt monsters all the time.

15:09.299 --> 15:13.129
They just sit around and
do laundry and talk, you know?

15:13.173 --> 15:15.566
I mean, that's what people like
the most, anyway.

15:15.610 --> 15:17.917
Well, I mean,
people like monsters.

15:17.960 --> 15:18.961
Meh.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.963
Anyway,
I got an online following,

15:21.007 --> 15:22.617
and it wasn't
paying the bills,

15:22.660 --> 15:25.185
so I started to make these
handcrafted miniatures.

15:25.228 --> 15:29.624
They took off, started turning
a profit, and here I am.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.408
Right. Right, right,
right, right, right.

15:31.452 --> 15:33.149
But people like monsters,
though. They do.

15:33.193 --> 15:35.021
I mean,
leviathans are cool.

15:35.064 --> 15:36.718
What?
They're all teeth!

15:36.761 --> 15:38.415
Anyway, I have the house
to myself

15:38.459 --> 15:39.851
for the first time
in months.

15:39.895 --> 15:41.462
This was supposed to be
my catch-up day.

15:41.505 --> 15:43.072
I have billing to do,
orders to fill,

15:43.116 --> 15:45.466
three AU Fic deadlines
breathing down my neck.

15:45.509 --> 15:48.295
So if you want to talk,
talk.

15:48.338 --> 15:50.950
Fast.

15:52.516 --> 15:53.996
Like, there's -- Like,
they don't even have lips.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.041
They're just,
like, teeth face.

15:55.084 --> 15:56.042
Raa--
Chuck!

15:56.085 --> 15:57.391
Okay.
Now.

15:57.434 --> 15:59.784
All right. Fine.

15:59.828 --> 16:03.614
All right, so I had
a bit of a falling out.

16:03.658 --> 16:06.052
With who?

16:08.141 --> 16:09.185
The Winchesters?

16:09.229 --> 16:11.013
Things were said.

16:11.057 --> 16:12.058
Uh...

16:12.101 --> 16:15.975
Now I've found myself
low on, um...

16:16.018 --> 16:18.107
resources.

16:18.151 --> 16:20.196
I went to ask my sister
for help,

16:20.240 --> 16:22.198
and she rejected me.

16:22.242 --> 16:24.374
'Cause she sucks.

16:24.418 --> 16:28.030
And now I'm just...
stuck.

16:28.074 --> 16:31.599
So I thought
I'd come see you,

16:31.642 --> 16:33.383
my number-one fan.

16:33.427 --> 16:39.999
And, I don't know, see if you
can help make me feel big again.

16:41.826 --> 16:45.874
So, you want me to...
fluff you?

16:45.917 --> 16:47.006
W--

16:48.572 --> 16:50.270
I mean, no.

16:50.313 --> 16:52.054
You do.

16:52.098 --> 16:54.796
You thought you could just
come back to me,

16:54.839 --> 16:57.059
your pathetic ex,
your number-one fan,

16:57.103 --> 16:59.366
and get what you've always
gotten from me --

16:59.409 --> 17:01.237
a nice big crank
on your ego.

17:01.281 --> 17:02.499
Well, I mean --

17:02.543 --> 17:04.849
Well, sorry, that's not me
anymore, Chuck.

17:04.893 --> 17:07.678
I am married
to an amazing man,

17:07.722 --> 17:09.811
I have two great kids,

17:09.854 --> 17:11.726
and I like myself,
Chuck.

17:11.769 --> 17:15.077
For the first time
in a long time,

17:15.121 --> 17:18.385
I like myself.

17:18.428 --> 17:21.779
So I don't need you.

17:23.042 --> 17:26.132
I know.

17:26.175 --> 17:29.309
You don't need me.

17:29.352 --> 17:31.180
No one does.

17:33.617 --> 17:37.230
I'm happy for you Becky,
that you like yourself.

17:38.318 --> 17:39.884
Because...

17:39.928 --> 17:42.191
I kind of hate me
right now.

17:47.675 --> 17:49.242
Really?

17:49.285 --> 17:52.114
Yeah, I just don't know
what I'm doing.

17:53.202 --> 17:55.161
I feel so lost.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.514
Okay. Well...

18:01.776 --> 18:04.170
What makes you happy?

18:04.213 --> 18:06.128
Writing.

18:06.172 --> 18:07.260
Creating.

18:07.303 --> 18:11.133
Then, Chuck,
you have to write.

18:16.617 --> 18:19.881
Really?
You're sure?

18:19.924 --> 18:22.188
Okay, all right.
Thanks, Toby.

18:22.231 --> 18:24.277
Appreciate it.

18:25.713 --> 18:26.801
Seriously?

18:26.844 --> 18:29.325
We're questioning
mascots now?

18:29.369 --> 18:30.674
Smart kid.

18:30.718 --> 18:32.328
He's actually got
a full ride to IU.

18:32.372 --> 18:33.938
Don't underestimate the mascot,
man.

18:33.982 --> 18:35.201
The guy's got access.

18:35.244 --> 18:37.116
He knows a lot
about cheerleaders.

18:37.159 --> 18:39.118
In a mostly-non-creepy
kind of way.

18:39.161 --> 18:42.860
Anyway, so, turns out
Susie was in charge.

18:42.904 --> 18:46.951
Then with her gone, Tori was
set to take over, except...

18:46.995 --> 18:49.171
Not anymore.
Yeah.

18:49.215 --> 18:52.000
Okay. So, who's third in line
to the throne?

18:53.393 --> 18:55.003
Mm.

18:55.046 --> 18:58.354
Not the mascot,
but he knows.

19:05.927 --> 19:07.363
I can't believe
she's really...

19:07.407 --> 19:09.060
I know.

19:09.104 --> 19:10.540
It's just...

19:10.584 --> 19:13.021
It's like a piece of my heart
is gone.

19:15.066 --> 19:18.722
Billy, I know
you and Susie were close,

19:18.766 --> 19:22.291
but if there's anything
you need...

19:26.339 --> 19:27.731
I...

19:27.775 --> 19:29.690
Janet: Billy!

19:34.303 --> 19:36.044
I have to go.

19:36.087 --> 19:37.088
Yeah.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.406
All right.

19:57.457 --> 20:01.504
We are here to celebrate
the life of my friend, Susie --

20:01.548 --> 20:03.245
No.

20:05.465 --> 20:10.731
We are here to celebrate the
life of my best friend, Susie --

20:10.774 --> 20:13.647
my best friend, Susie,
who I miss like --

20:13.690 --> 20:16.780
like she was a part of me.

20:16.824 --> 20:19.914
And in many ways,
she is still a part of me.

20:19.957 --> 20:23.439
She'll always be
a part of all of us.

20:23.483 --> 20:27.791
Susie Martin was
as rare as a ghost orchid

20:27.835 --> 20:31.055
and as unique as a snowflake.

20:31.099 --> 20:36.104
So beautiful inside and out.

20:36.147 --> 20:39.499
But as Robert Frost tells us,

20:39.542 --> 20:43.285
"Nothing gold can stay."

20:43.329 --> 20:49.509
And that's what Susie was --
pure gold.

20:54.557 --> 20:56.167
That's good stuff.

20:56.211 --> 20:58.082
Especially the part
about the snowflake,

20:58.126 --> 20:59.867
and, uh,
getting choked up.

20:59.910 --> 21:01.260
I mean,
if you're gonna milk it,

21:01.303 --> 21:04.088
really get in there
and squeeze, you know?

21:07.701 --> 21:09.442
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

21:09.485 --> 21:11.357
FBI.

21:12.923 --> 21:15.012
We're here about Susie.

21:15.056 --> 21:17.667
Uh, you mean
about who killed her?

21:17.711 --> 21:19.060
Yeah.

21:19.103 --> 21:23.020
Yeah, now that she's gone
and then Tori,

21:23.064 --> 21:27.677
really kind of worked out
for you, didn't it?

21:27.721 --> 21:29.505
We should talk.
Outside.

21:30.854 --> 21:33.030
Um, I --
I think I should go.

21:33.074 --> 21:35.555
Wait, wait, wait.
Veronica...

21:35.598 --> 21:37.644
do you have braces?

21:41.430 --> 21:43.389
Yeah. So?

21:52.659 --> 21:54.138
Friggin' braces?

21:54.182 --> 21:56.010
Kinda makes it impossible
to fang out.

21:56.053 --> 21:58.317
All right, so if she's not
our vamp, then who is?

22:06.412 --> 22:08.457
You weren't out front.
I had to find you.

22:08.501 --> 22:11.286
It was embarrassing, Mom.
I just wanted to help.

22:11.330 --> 22:14.115
Susie would have want--No.
We do not say her name.

22:14.158 --> 22:15.943
Would you talk to your son,
please?

22:17.379 --> 22:19.947
Just listen
to your mother.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.693
Really?

22:26.736 --> 22:29.086
I need wine.

23:05.601 --> 23:07.037
You have anything stronger?

23:07.081 --> 23:09.562
Becky: We have
cran-apple juice.

23:09.605 --> 23:10.650
Hmm.

23:10.693 --> 23:13.435
I'm good.

23:14.697 --> 23:17.657
It's just, things are
different now, Becky.

23:17.700 --> 23:21.400
I mean, I used to be able to see
Sam and Dean in my head,

23:21.443 --> 23:23.402
wherever they were,
whatever they were doing.

23:23.445 --> 23:26.753
It was all just there,
ripe for the picking.

23:26.796 --> 23:28.102
And now it's just gone.

23:28.145 --> 23:30.104
Because you lost
your prophet powers?

23:30.147 --> 23:31.758
Yeah.
Something like that.

23:31.801 --> 23:33.455
Then write about
something else.

23:33.499 --> 23:36.806
But this it. I mean,
this is my favorite story.

23:36.850 --> 23:38.460
Then write about them.

23:38.504 --> 23:39.809
I-I -- Okay.

23:39.853 --> 23:41.202
I feel like we're going
in circles now.

23:41.245 --> 23:44.074
No,
you'regoing in circles.

23:44.118 --> 23:47.991
You're a writer,
a writer who's not writing.

23:48.035 --> 23:49.993
And when a writer's
not writing,

23:50.037 --> 23:53.693
they feel sad,
and they get lost.

23:53.736 --> 23:56.217
And the writer
asks themselves,

23:56.260 --> 23:57.871
"Why do I feel this way?

23:57.914 --> 24:00.003
Why am I
so sad and lost?"

24:00.047 --> 24:01.657
And what does
all this navel-gazing

24:01.701 --> 24:04.268
and hair-pulling
amount to in the end?

24:04.312 --> 24:06.575
Procrastination,
distraction.

24:06.619 --> 24:09.622
Just one of a million ways
the writer avoids

24:09.665 --> 24:12.059
doing the one thing that is
all but guaranteed

24:12.102 --> 24:14.409
to make the writer
feel better.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.672
Which is...?

24:16.716 --> 24:18.631
Writing.

24:19.588 --> 24:20.676
But what if I can't?

24:20.720 --> 24:22.330
You can.

24:22.373 --> 24:25.464
The only question is,
will you?

24:27.901 --> 24:29.685
How'd you learn all this?

24:29.729 --> 24:31.557
I'm a writer, too,
Chuck.

24:31.600 --> 24:34.603
Oh. I mean, fanfic -- it's not
really the same thing --

24:34.647 --> 24:35.517
Writing's writing.

24:35.561 --> 24:36.779
Okay.

24:36.823 --> 24:40.087
The self-sabotage,
the doubts,

24:40.130 --> 24:41.523
the struggle against time.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.786
So whenever I have
a spare minute,

24:43.830 --> 24:46.702
I write.

24:51.402 --> 24:54.623
Yeah.

24:54.667 --> 24:56.756
Yeah!

25:01.325 --> 25:03.197
Wait.
I didn't mean right now --

25:03.240 --> 25:04.677
Shh, shh, shh!

25:15.818 --> 25:19.169
Bailey: This is the security
footage from last night.

25:19.213 --> 25:21.737
Do we have any idea
who that might be?

25:24.348 --> 25:26.568
No clue.
He's wearing a mask.

25:26.612 --> 25:30.137
Well, crap.

25:30.180 --> 25:31.704
Wait a second.

25:31.747 --> 25:33.270
Go back.

25:36.360 --> 25:38.449
Uh, zoom into that.

25:40.234 --> 25:42.323
You got it?

25:42.366 --> 25:43.585
Yeah.

25:43.629 --> 25:45.413
Billy:
You're worried about the game?

25:45.456 --> 25:46.762
I mean, this is insane!

25:46.806 --> 25:48.590
This is what
we've been worked for,

25:48.634 --> 25:50.853
what we've sacrificed
so much for.

25:50.897 --> 25:53.290
Well,
I never asked you to.

25:53.334 --> 25:55.031
We're your parents.

25:55.075 --> 25:56.598
You don't need to ask.

25:56.642 --> 26:00.602
Everything that we have done
has been for you.

26:00.646 --> 26:03.518
We just want you to
be happy.

26:07.391 --> 26:09.655
Henry: Son,
we're trying our best.

26:09.698 --> 26:11.265
W-What do you
want from us?

26:11.308 --> 26:14.616
Listen to what I'm saying --
I don't want anything.

26:14.660 --> 26:17.837
I never wanted any of this!
That's the point!

26:24.278 --> 26:25.235
Hi.

26:25.279 --> 26:26.759
Your dad home?

26:29.718 --> 26:32.503
Uh, Dad?

26:42.818 --> 26:44.777
Billy, get upstairs.

26:44.820 --> 26:46.039
Now.

26:50.043 --> 26:51.610
Good thinking.

26:51.653 --> 26:53.133
You don't want the kid
to see this part.

26:53.176 --> 26:55.352
I don't know what
you're talking about.

26:55.396 --> 26:57.224
Yeah, sure you do.

26:57.267 --> 27:00.183
Those girls
that went missing...

27:00.227 --> 27:03.709
that was you.

27:09.932 --> 27:12.500
On it.

27:12.543 --> 27:14.502
Look, arrest me.
Fine.

27:14.545 --> 27:16.809
Just -- Just please
leave my family out of it.

27:23.772 --> 27:25.121
Arrest you?

27:25.165 --> 27:27.863
No, see?

27:27.907 --> 27:31.040
We're not FBI.

27:31.084 --> 27:32.999
Sam: Shh.

27:33.042 --> 27:34.304
I'm here to help, okay?

27:34.348 --> 27:36.655
Just hang in there.
Hang in there.

27:36.698 --> 27:39.745
And we know exactly
what you are.

27:51.974 --> 27:53.933
I'm gonna get you out of here,
okay?

27:53.976 --> 27:55.282
I got you.

27:55.325 --> 27:56.762
I got you.

27:58.894 --> 28:00.722
You shouldn't be here.

28:07.598 --> 28:08.948
Sammy, how's it going
back there?!

28:15.781 --> 28:19.262
Okay.
Was not expecting that.

28:19.306 --> 28:21.090
How's she doing?

28:21.134 --> 28:23.092
Not good.

28:23.136 --> 28:24.920
She's lost
a lot of blood.

28:24.964 --> 28:27.096
She needs a doctor.

28:27.140 --> 28:28.881
Janet,
what are you doing?

28:28.924 --> 28:30.230
I'm saving this family.

28:30.273 --> 28:32.362
No. Listen.

28:32.406 --> 28:34.190
It's over, okay?

28:34.234 --> 28:36.758
They --
They caught me.

28:36.802 --> 28:38.891
You just need to get Billy
and leave.

28:41.894 --> 28:43.243
Please.

29:03.959 --> 29:06.048
Well?

29:06.092 --> 29:09.748
It's so good!

29:09.791 --> 29:11.227
You did it.

29:11.271 --> 29:12.838
Congratulations!

29:12.881 --> 29:13.969
Yeah?

29:14.013 --> 29:15.362
I mean, the story --

29:15.405 --> 29:16.711
I loved it.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.800
In fact, I'm feeling
so inspired,

29:18.844 --> 29:22.412
I would love to just jump in
and get back to my own work.

29:22.456 --> 29:24.371
No, no, no,
you're shining me on.

29:24.414 --> 29:26.416
What?
No, I'm not --

29:26.460 --> 29:27.766
It's a rough draft,
Becky.

29:27.809 --> 29:30.246
You've gotta
have some notes.

29:30.290 --> 29:32.945
Just, like, one note.

29:32.988 --> 29:35.034
Okay.

29:35.077 --> 29:38.602
If I had to give
one note...

29:38.646 --> 29:40.604
The jeopardy, Chuck --

29:40.648 --> 29:42.781
it's feeling a little...
thin?

29:42.824 --> 29:43.869
Low-stakes?

29:43.912 --> 29:45.174
It's fun to hear the boys'
voices,

29:45.218 --> 29:46.828
but a story is only
as good as its villain,

29:46.872 --> 29:50.527
and these villains are just not
feeling very...dangerous?

29:50.571 --> 29:52.878
Not to mention,
there's no classic rock.

29:52.921 --> 29:54.836
No one
even mentions Cass.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.621
The climax
is a little stale.

29:57.665 --> 30:01.625
Boys tied up again while we get
the villains' monologue,

30:01.669 --> 30:04.019
which, frankly,
isn't one of your best.

30:04.063 --> 30:07.022
A little originality
wouldn't...

30:08.937 --> 30:10.417
...hurt.

30:14.116 --> 30:16.075
You want jeopardy?

30:16.118 --> 30:18.077
You want danger?

30:20.209 --> 30:21.907
Move!

30:26.389 --> 30:28.000
I'll give you danger.

30:29.305 --> 30:31.830
Chuck?

30:31.873 --> 30:34.049
Chuck?

30:34.093 --> 30:35.485
Chuck!

30:35.529 --> 30:38.880
Dad, what's going...
on...

30:38.924 --> 30:40.882
Your dad's a vampire.
That's what's going on.

30:43.015 --> 30:45.669
Let me guess -- few weeks ago,
maybe a month,

30:45.713 --> 30:47.889
you had a run-in with
something big and mean.

30:47.933 --> 30:49.673
It turned you.

30:49.717 --> 30:51.240
You thought you could deal.

30:51.284 --> 30:53.895
But the cow's blood or whatever
just wasn't cutting it,

30:53.939 --> 30:56.550
so you upgraded to humans.

30:56.593 --> 30:59.074
How am I doing?
Am I right?

30:59.118 --> 31:01.207
No, I don't think you're right,
Dean.

31:02.948 --> 31:04.558
It's not the dad,
it's the son.

31:04.601 --> 31:06.081
Shut your mouth!Mom --

31:06.125 --> 31:08.518
Billy, go!
No.

31:08.562 --> 31:10.999
You're right,
about all of it.

31:11.043 --> 31:13.306
Okay? But what happened
with Susie, I didn't --

31:15.612 --> 31:17.832
We were together.

31:19.138 --> 31:21.749
We were kissing...

31:21.792 --> 31:24.099
I could hear her heart...

31:30.410 --> 31:31.802
Billy:
And her blood, and she --

31:31.846 --> 31:34.109
it just tasted so good,
I just...

31:37.112 --> 31:38.635
I couldn't stop.

31:45.991 --> 31:48.123
Then what?

31:48.167 --> 31:49.951
I told my mom and dad.

31:52.736 --> 31:54.477
So, you, what --
chopped up the body?

31:54.521 --> 31:56.349
Made it look like
some wannabe Bundy?

31:56.392 --> 31:57.480
And then grabbed Tori
and...

31:59.047 --> 32:02.616
...and kept her as
his own personal blood bag?

32:02.659 --> 32:05.053
Awesome parenting.
Awesome.

32:05.097 --> 32:07.621
This is not
Billy's fault.

32:07.664 --> 32:09.057
He was the victim.

32:09.101 --> 32:12.104
What were we
supposed to do?

32:12.147 --> 32:15.411
You were gonna let me
just cut off your head.

32:15.455 --> 32:17.500
You don't have children,
do you?

32:17.544 --> 32:20.025
Because if you did,
you would know

32:20.068 --> 32:24.377
that to see your child in pain
rips your heart out.

32:24.420 --> 32:28.207
And you'd know that
you'd do anything.

32:28.250 --> 32:29.556
You'd die for them.

32:29.599 --> 32:31.819
Or kill for them.
Mom, no.

32:31.862 --> 32:33.777
We can bury them out back,
under the peonies.

32:33.821 --> 32:35.388
Everything
is going to be fine.

32:35.431 --> 32:37.999
There's no way
you believe that.

32:41.133 --> 32:43.265
Mom...

32:43.309 --> 32:45.093
Stop.

32:54.059 --> 32:57.323
We just wanted him to have
a normal life.

32:59.020 --> 33:01.066
Mom, I can't.

33:01.109 --> 33:03.155
That's what I've been trying
to tell you.

33:03.198 --> 33:04.634
I can't.

33:04.678 --> 33:08.029
I killed someone that I loved,
and I'll do it again.

33:08.073 --> 33:11.032
I know I will.
I can't control this!

33:15.210 --> 33:17.256
I'm a monster.

33:23.566 --> 33:25.525
So here's
what's gonna happen.

33:25.568 --> 33:28.223
You're gonna take Tori
to the hospital,

33:28.267 --> 33:30.182
and you're gonna tell them
that I kidnapped her.

33:30.225 --> 33:31.574
What? No.

33:31.618 --> 33:34.229
Dad said he was wearing a mask
when he grabbed her.

33:34.273 --> 33:35.970
Tori won't know.

33:36.014 --> 33:40.670
You tell them I took her...
and then I ran away.

33:40.714 --> 33:44.239
Billy, don't do this.

33:47.286 --> 33:50.419
Then you and me...

33:50.463 --> 33:53.335
we're gonna
go for a ride.

33:53.379 --> 33:58.601
That's how this works...
right?

34:11.266 --> 34:13.225
I'm sorry, Mom.

34:13.268 --> 34:16.184
But this is the best way.

34:16.228 --> 34:17.533
This is the only way.

34:20.493 --> 34:26.847
♪ Finding room to breathe

34:26.890 --> 34:31.895
♪ Go on beyond your way

34:34.637 --> 34:40.208
♪ And see

34:40.252 --> 34:45.561
♪ And though

34:45.605 --> 34:49.304
♪ The sounds of someday

34:49.348 --> 34:53.308
♪ May be home

34:53.352 --> 34:59.575
♪ And though

34:59.619 --> 35:03.231
♪ The sounds of someday

35:03.275 --> 35:06.626
♪ May be home

35:06.669 --> 35:08.236
♪ Yeah

35:21.249 --> 35:23.033
No.

35:23.077 --> 35:24.078
You can't --

35:24.122 --> 35:26.254
I did.

35:26.298 --> 35:28.909
Y--
This is just an ending.

35:28.952 --> 35:29.997
Yeah.

35:30.040 --> 35:32.086
I don't know how
I'm gonna get there,

35:32.130 --> 35:34.175
but I know
where I'm goin'.

35:34.219 --> 35:37.613
B-But it's so...

35:37.657 --> 35:39.267
dark.

35:39.311 --> 35:41.182
But great, right?

35:41.226 --> 35:45.186
I can see it now --
"Supernatural: The End."

35:45.230 --> 35:48.624
And the cover is just
a gravestone

35:48.668 --> 35:51.453
that says "Winchester."

35:53.238 --> 35:56.415
The fans
are gonna love it.

35:56.458 --> 35:57.372
Well?

35:57.416 --> 35:58.808
It's awful!

35:58.852 --> 36:00.549
Horrible.

36:00.593 --> 36:02.725
It's hopeless.

36:04.814 --> 36:08.514
You can't do this
to the fans.

36:08.557 --> 36:10.472
What you did to Dean?

36:10.516 --> 36:12.344
What you did to Sam?

36:12.387 --> 36:14.259
There, see?
It's making you feel something.

36:14.302 --> 36:15.347
That's good, right?

36:15.390 --> 36:16.391
No!

36:16.435 --> 36:19.699
Rod: Babe!
We're home!

36:19.742 --> 36:20.874
Babe!

36:20.917 --> 36:22.267
You have to leave.

36:22.310 --> 36:24.094
Nah,
I kind of like it here.

36:24.138 --> 36:26.140
Babe, you wouldn't believe
what happened.

36:26.184 --> 36:29.926
Please.Junior was fine,
but I puked everywhere.

36:32.364 --> 36:33.756
Babe?

36:35.062 --> 36:37.369
Hey.

36:38.326 --> 36:40.241
Rod?!

36:40.285 --> 36:42.461
What happened?

36:42.504 --> 36:43.462
Where is he?

36:43.505 --> 36:44.506
He's gone.

36:44.550 --> 36:45.725
What?!

36:45.768 --> 36:47.379
-Hey, Mom, we're back!
-Hi, Mom!

36:47.422 --> 36:48.815
Rod Jr.: Dad got sick!
He threw up all over the side

36:48.858 --> 36:50.382
of the b--
-Dad threw u--

36:50.425 --> 36:52.340
No!

36:52.384 --> 36:53.602
The kids.

36:53.646 --> 36:54.951
Oh, don't worry.

36:54.995 --> 36:58.477
They're not dead.
They're just away.

36:58.520 --> 37:01.697
Oh, yeah.

37:01.741 --> 37:03.395
I'm God.

37:06.963 --> 37:09.314
What are you --

37:09.357 --> 37:11.011
No.

37:11.054 --> 37:13.796
You bring them back.

37:13.840 --> 37:16.495
You bring them back!

37:18.714 --> 37:20.542
Please...

37:20.586 --> 37:22.805
you can't do this.

37:22.849 --> 37:25.286
Oh, Becky.

37:28.333 --> 37:30.509
I can do anything.

37:33.512 --> 37:35.383
I'm a writer.

37:48.483 --> 37:51.094
Well, that was
an interesting one.

37:52.444 --> 37:54.837
Yeah.

37:54.881 --> 37:58.188
What Henry did...

37:58.232 --> 38:00.147
we'd have done
the same thing.

38:00.190 --> 38:03.281
For Jack.
If we had the chance.

38:05.631 --> 38:07.372
Yeah.

38:07.415 --> 38:09.852
Yeah, we would.

38:09.896 --> 38:11.419
Look, man, I get it.

38:11.463 --> 38:17.164
I get it.
We have lost way, way too much.

38:18.687 --> 38:22.865
And it's hard not to feel like
just...cashing out.

38:25.651 --> 38:28.523
I felt like that.

38:28.567 --> 38:32.353
After Chuck,
back at the crypt.

38:32.397 --> 38:36.401
But you know what
brought me back?

38:36.444 --> 38:38.185
You did.

38:38.228 --> 38:41.449
By sayin' that what we do
still matters.

38:46.280 --> 38:47.499
I mean, that's why I wanted to
drag us out here.

38:47.542 --> 38:49.414
That's why I wanted to --
to work a case,

38:49.457 --> 38:52.939
to save lives,
you know?

38:52.982 --> 38:55.724
'Cause it is -- it's a --
it's a crap job.

38:55.768 --> 38:58.292
We do the ugly things so that
people can live happy.

38:58.336 --> 39:02.340
Yeah. Yeah.
Lucky them.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.779
Yeah, lucky them.

39:11.174 --> 39:13.263
But it doesn't
change a thing.

39:13.307 --> 39:17.833
You know what I mean?
We still do the job.

39:19.052 --> 39:22.011
But we don't do it for us.

39:22.055 --> 39:24.492
We did it for Jack,

39:24.536 --> 39:26.886
for Mom,

39:26.929 --> 39:28.540
for Rowena.

39:28.583 --> 39:32.544
We owe it to anybody who has
ever gave a damn about us

39:32.587 --> 39:36.069
to keep putting one foot
in front of the other.

39:36.112 --> 39:39.115
No matter what.

39:39.159 --> 39:42.641
And, hey, man,
like you said,

39:42.684 --> 39:44.164
now that Chuck's gone,

39:44.207 --> 39:46.862
we're finally on our own.

39:46.906 --> 39:53.173
We are finally free to...

39:53.216 --> 39:56.481
move on, you know?

39:58.178 --> 40:01.094
I don't know. Uh...
I-I don't know if I can move on.

40:01.137 --> 40:04.010
You know,
I -- I -- I --

40:04.053 --> 40:06.142
I can't forget
any of them.

40:06.186 --> 40:09.363
Dean, I still think
about Jessica.

40:09.407 --> 40:12.148
I -- I can't just
let that go.

40:12.192 --> 40:13.628
No, man, that's not
what I'm talking about.

40:13.672 --> 40:15.674
I know, I know, I know.
I'm sorry. I know.

40:15.717 --> 40:21.593
But -- But what I'm saying is
that I don't feel free.

40:24.204 --> 40:26.728
What we've done,
what we've lost, right now,

40:26.772 --> 40:30.515
that is what I'm feeling,
and -- and sometimes it's...

40:33.605 --> 40:37.522
Sometimes it's like
I-I-I can't even breathe.

40:45.704 --> 40:47.401
But maybe tomorrow.

40:47.445 --> 40:50.839
You know, maybe I'll --
I'll feel better in the morning.

40:54.713 --> 40:56.802
And what if you don't?

40:56.845 --> 40:59.457
I don't know.

41:34.622 --> 41:37.320
Oh, yeah.

41:37.364 --> 41:39.540
This is gonna be good.
