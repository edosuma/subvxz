00:30.364 --> 00:32.031
Wow, it sure is white in here.

00:36.161 --> 00:39.540
Down we... go.

00:40.207 --> 00:42.334
It's not painted white, though.

00:43.293 --> 00:47.381
All these formulas and diagrams overlap
and form layers, making them look white.

00:48.632 --> 00:51.260
He probably started out
writing them in black.

00:51.593 --> 00:54.346
But once it was all black,
he began using white.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.099
But even that wasn't enough,

00:57.182 --> 01:00.269
and he added more and more clearboards
as time went on.

01:01.436 --> 01:03.814
It's like... When I see all this,

01:04.230 --> 01:07.359
each one starts to look like
a cry for help from Keith.

01:11.738 --> 01:12.573
Lily?

01:23.250 --> 01:27.713
What's the answer
that Keith's trying to find?

01:33.844 --> 01:36.805
SOUTHWESTERN CREMONA, MORTA ISLAND

02:33.278 --> 02:35.447
Why did you save me?

02:36.657 --> 02:39.368
There's a few more things
I want to ask you.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.998
But first, dig in.
We can talk about that afterwards.

02:51.630 --> 02:53.090
Do you recognize this man?

02:56.927 --> 02:57.803
I do.

02:58.929 --> 03:01.515
Dead Kyle, a serial killer.

03:02.307 --> 03:04.768
Also known as
the Raven-haired Murder Machine.

03:06.228 --> 03:11.441
And the man they claim
to be my little sister's killer.

03:12.526 --> 03:13.360
Claim to be?

03:20.867 --> 03:23.453
Is he what you wanted to ask me about?

03:24.121 --> 03:29.334
During his trial, he escaped from
the mental hospital he was being held at,

03:29.876 --> 03:34.339
and as he was about to commit a new crime,
he was killed by parties unknown.

03:36.383 --> 03:39.511
-This man was--
-I really don't care about the details.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.390
I know Kyle didn't kill my little sister.

03:44.349 --> 03:47.477
How she was killed was different
from his other victims.

03:48.603 --> 03:51.690
So why did he confess to murdering her?

03:53.358 --> 03:57.237
How did he know where she was killed
and where the murder weapon was?

03:57.779 --> 03:59.489
How did he pass his polygraph?

04:00.449 --> 04:01.825
Who was he covering for?

04:04.828 --> 04:06.163
And to start with,

04:07.414 --> 04:09.708
who was Dead Kyle, anyway?

04:12.836 --> 04:15.547
You know who he is, don't you?

04:18.591 --> 04:19.426
Yes.

04:20.427 --> 04:21.261
I know.

04:22.471 --> 04:24.514
He was a Reggie who was released.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.434
As you guessed, he's not human.

04:28.477 --> 04:29.311
"Reggie"?

04:30.562 --> 04:34.900
A race of ancient demihumans
created solely to fight.

04:35.567 --> 04:39.613
He was one of the Reggies
who attacked the Institute that day.

04:44.409 --> 04:45.285
I killed him.

04:47.537 --> 04:51.917
So, Killer B's motive
was revenge all along. Well, well.

04:53.543 --> 04:56.463
Every single criminal you've killed
has been

04:56.630 --> 05:00.217
a Reggie who took part in that attack,
haven't they?

05:02.636 --> 05:04.471
There was a burnt smell everywhere.

05:06.181 --> 05:10.727
That day, surrounded by ash and despair,
I swore a vow.

05:12.395 --> 05:17.734
I would kill every last one of them.
And I would find Yuna no matter what.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.112
And until I do,

05:21.780 --> 05:25.325
I won't let anyone stand in my way,
I don't care who they are.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.918
<i>Among the foot soldiers of Market Maker</i>

05:35.544 --> 05:38.713
<i>exists a team whose sole mission
<i>is manipulating social disorder,</i></i>

05:38.797 --> 05:42.551
<i>based out of their flagship,
<i>the Moby Dick.</i></i>

05:43.510 --> 05:46.555
<i>They sometimes brainwash humans
<i>to suit their purposes</i></i>

05:46.763 --> 05:49.516
<i>and it's said
<i>you should never cross the group.</i></i>

05:53.395 --> 05:55.522
<i>Letters deduced from a watch...</i>

05:56.982 --> 05:58.900
<i>J.H.R.</i>

06:03.697 --> 06:06.783
The site hasn't been updated in a while.

06:06.866 --> 06:07.909
<i>Oh, that!</i>

06:08.451 --> 06:09.286
<i>Well,</i>

06:09.828 --> 06:13.665
<i>I figured they might make contact
<i>if I got their attention,</i></i>

06:13.748 --> 06:16.042
<i>so I made up that website.</i>

06:16.459 --> 06:20.005
I saw the watch.
It was Jean who attacked Bran, wasn't it?

06:20.880 --> 06:21.715
Yeah.

06:21.965 --> 06:24.843
<i>Keith, turn yourself in. It's not too...</i>

06:25.093 --> 06:27.095
He's here. With me, right now.

06:28.096 --> 06:31.182
<i>Killer B, you mean?
<i>So contact was made after all.</i></i>

06:32.475 --> 06:36.271
Kyle isn't the person who killed Erika.
That's for certain.

06:37.606 --> 06:41.109
And just as I hypothesized,
it turns out he wasn't human.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.364
Even coming from you,
that's hard to believe.

06:48.033 --> 06:50.994
It won't be long. It'll be over soon.

06:53.038 --> 06:55.874
Everything that began
with me deciphering the inscription

06:55.957 --> 06:58.752
is about to come to an end.

07:00.170 --> 07:02.547
I'll finally get the answers.

07:04.215 --> 07:07.886
We already have our answer.
We got it a long time ago.

07:11.473 --> 07:16.269
You're letting the ends justify the means
and are starting to go off the rails.

07:16.353 --> 07:17.354
Tell me I'm wrong.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.860
Keith,
Bran almost got killed because of this.

07:24.653 --> 07:27.364
<i>Anyway, come back in.
<i>Let's work something out.</i></i>

07:30.784 --> 07:32.619
They're making their move, huh?

07:34.579 --> 07:39.751
To take me out, they... Market Maker
has finally started to take action.

07:41.086 --> 07:41.920
Haven't they?

07:46.299 --> 07:48.927
Did you even anticipate that, too?

07:54.391 --> 07:55.225
Eric.

07:56.601 --> 07:57.435
Yes?

07:59.020 --> 08:01.439
I really appreciate all you've done
for me.

08:02.273 --> 08:03.692
I wanted you to know.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.194
<i>Keith?</i>

08:06.820 --> 08:09.572
<i>Keith! Please, wait! Keith!</i>

08:15.620 --> 08:16.496
It's begun.

08:31.928 --> 08:35.974
What's the big idea, asking me
to come here at the crack of dawn?

08:59.956 --> 09:02.792
I don't know what you're doing,
but are you done?

09:06.212 --> 09:08.339
The red text written on the ceiling.

09:08.965 --> 09:11.509
It's the only complete
mathematical formula.

09:12.844 --> 09:16.514
I've re-entered them three times.
I thought it must be a mistake.

09:30.070 --> 09:30.904
Boris.

09:33.323 --> 09:36.409
Is this why Keith has always
kept his distance from me?

09:37.660 --> 09:40.163
Who is this? You know, don't you?

09:42.457 --> 09:46.461
Is there some connection between
Keith's coming back and this person?

09:47.253 --> 09:48.880
What is Keith trying to do?

09:50.799 --> 09:51.841
That girl...

09:53.093 --> 09:54.969
During the winter eight years back,

09:55.053 --> 09:58.181
her body was cut up
and dumped in the mountains.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.725
She was Keith's little sister.

10:06.523 --> 10:12.403
So to reuse discarded Reggies,
that gold solution is necessary?

10:13.071 --> 10:16.699
It's used to adjust their testosterone
and dopamine levels.

10:16.783 --> 10:20.370
There seem to be various kinds,
but I don't know much about it.

10:21.412 --> 10:23.331
What causes them to be discarded?

10:24.165 --> 10:28.920
Around age 20, Reggies lose control of
their powers and can't think rationally.

10:29.003 --> 10:31.297
They're discarded
when they fall below a set value.

10:31.881 --> 10:35.093
And by "discarded,"
you mean released into society?

10:35.844 --> 10:36.678
Yeah.

10:37.554 --> 10:41.349
So, how many are there?
Grade-C goods like Kyle, I mean.

10:42.225 --> 10:43.101
There are lots.

10:44.227 --> 10:48.231
This country is crawling with more
discarded Reggies than you can imagine.

10:49.190 --> 10:53.653
At a signal, they'll turn into frenzied
weapons, killing until they're put down.

10:53.736 --> 10:57.407
<i>It's disguised as something else.
<i>So although it's in plain sight,</i></i>

10:57.490 --> 11:00.577
<i>-no one knows.
-Killing is the only way to stop them.</i>

11:02.787 --> 11:05.039
-I'm gonna buy some red bean buns.
-Huh?

11:17.969 --> 11:20.430
I'll answer
if it's about the investigation.

11:21.097 --> 11:24.225
I have issues with the direction
this investigation is taking.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.227
I'm busy. Come back later.

11:28.688 --> 11:32.400
We could keep this up forever,
but I don't think we'll find Keith.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.569
That's an order. Keep working.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.487
-I won't obey.
-Then get out.

11:38.323 --> 11:41.659
You're hindering the investigation.
Leave your badge and get out.

11:43.119 --> 11:45.496
Didn't you hear me? You're suspended.

11:46.289 --> 11:49.542
I'm saying that I don't need fools
who can't obey orders.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.294
Get out right now.

11:54.255 --> 11:56.674
Die, you four-eyed chin with legs! Jerk!

11:56.799 --> 11:59.844
Everybody in the RIS calls you that! Jerk!

12:03.139 --> 12:05.808
Eric. Lily's on the move.

12:06.476 --> 12:10.271
Are you sure this is a good idea?
I'm worried.

12:10.813 --> 12:13.191
The RIS is
under Market Maker surveillance.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.193
UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS INTO RIS
INVESTIGATION SYSTEM

12:15.276 --> 12:17.779
This is our only option
to get ahead of them.

12:17.862 --> 12:21.532
<i>Yeah, but I'm worried
<i>Lily might get caught in the crossfire.</i></i>

12:21.616 --> 12:23.117
METAMORPHISM?
MARKET MAKER?

12:23.201 --> 12:25.203
Boris, the girl is a professional.

12:26.162 --> 12:29.582
I'm sure you've noticed
that Lily and Keith are very similar.

12:29.666 --> 12:32.418
SYSTEM REBUILD IS IMPERATIVE: KAELA
COMMANDO TEAM NECESSARY: LILY

12:32.502 --> 12:35.964
Their thought process. Their insight.
Their drive. Their inquiring minds.

12:36.714 --> 12:40.593
The reason I scouted Lily for the RIS
over everyone's objections

12:41.302 --> 12:44.430
is that deep down,
her abilities are equal to Keith's.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.516
Because I sensed that in her.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.142
And...

12:48.893 --> 12:52.730
Boris, if Keith doesn't want to be found,
I can't find him.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.566
<i>I'm betting on Lily.</i>

12:58.277 --> 12:59.112
<i>Understood.</i>

13:13.668 --> 13:14.877
Kaela, are you done?

13:15.253 --> 13:16.087
Almost there.

13:17.380 --> 13:18.506
Okay, all done!

13:28.641 --> 13:29.851
Are we secure now?

13:29.934 --> 13:33.896
I don't know. But I think
this will keep them out for a while.

13:37.358 --> 13:39.569
Here. This red line is Lily, right?

13:40.945 --> 13:42.613
Who tagged her car?

13:43.156 --> 13:44.032
Boris did it.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.409
She's gonna be upset when she finds out.

13:46.492 --> 13:50.621
I had to do it. I don't think she has
what it takes to keep up an act.

13:50.705 --> 13:52.081
Yeah, probably not.

13:52.874 --> 13:54.667
-Because she's an idiot.
-Because she's an idiot.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.744
I want a red bean bun.

14:33.623 --> 14:35.917
I don't have any leads.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.170
It's the same thing everywhere I look.

14:40.129 --> 14:43.966
If it's all the same,
I should've gone someplace with good food.

14:49.639 --> 14:52.558
The smell of those spices
with the funny taste...

15:05.780 --> 15:09.742
HOLS ISLAND

15:12.954 --> 15:16.624
How did you know that blue steel
was the Reggies' weakness?

15:18.084 --> 15:19.710
Same as you.

15:20.878 --> 15:22.130
My father's journal.

15:27.301 --> 15:29.971
How long do you plan
to wander around aimlessly?

15:32.432 --> 15:34.559
There's nothing aimless about it.

15:35.101 --> 15:38.020
We're hitting up towns
that have good places to eat.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.272
I said "how long"?

15:39.355 --> 15:41.274
Until your body is back at 100%.

15:42.024 --> 15:45.069
If you're gonna complain,
rub one out and go to sleep.

15:50.825 --> 15:53.035
You seem pretty much recovered to me.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.080
It seems like you're ready to fight.

15:57.248 --> 16:00.543
I'm guessing you have an ulterior motive
for saving me.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.211
Answer me.

16:05.756 --> 16:08.092
There's something I want your help with.

16:09.385 --> 16:12.722
-There's no reason for me to help you.
-There is.

16:13.014 --> 16:15.516
Would you mind getting this
out of my face?

16:16.017 --> 16:16.934
It's in the way.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.528
Now, I want an explanation.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.741
I've been investigating two men
for a long time.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.660
That's why I got back into the field.

16:35.328 --> 16:38.456
I needed to see everything
with my own two eyes.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.128
She's almost to Hols Island.

16:44.212 --> 16:47.298
Can't imagine Keith would be
in a place like that.

16:47.381 --> 16:51.219
It's nothing but old men and women,
and a handful of tourist traps.

16:51.302 --> 16:54.722
I think Keith would stand out
if he set foot outside.

16:54.805 --> 16:56.516
KEITH'S GOAL ISN'T ESCAPE

16:56.599 --> 16:58.893
Kaela, make arrangements for a chopper.

17:01.145 --> 17:04.190
I've spent a long, long time
looking into them.

17:04.732 --> 17:07.193
But no matter how deep I dig,

17:07.401 --> 17:10.445
clues that seem made up
get in the way of the answer.

17:10.988 --> 17:11.821
In the way?

17:12.240 --> 17:13.074
Yeah.

17:13.824 --> 17:16.911
The first is "the possibility
of non-humans."

17:17.869 --> 17:21.457
-The existence of you guys, basically.
-You aren't getting it,

17:21.540 --> 17:24.377
-but Yuna and I aren't Reggies, so--
-I'm starving.

17:24.961 --> 17:26.712
Let's go grab something to eat.

17:30.466 --> 17:31.300
What else?

17:31.884 --> 17:34.762
Before I get to that,
let me ask you something.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.765
Was Yuna the Yuna you remembered?

17:41.143 --> 17:42.979
She wasn't. Not at first.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.565
I thought as much.

17:48.192 --> 17:49.068
My guess is...

17:49.652 --> 17:54.907
Man One has the ability to manipulate
memories and bend people to his will.

17:56.701 --> 17:59.870
You had blocked off your own memories,
right?

18:00.830 --> 18:02.456
Isn't that the same ability?

18:08.129 --> 18:11.674
So you're saying he and I are related?

18:12.216 --> 18:13.050
Yeah.

18:13.801 --> 18:16.929
The person who killed my father,
who took Yuna from you,

18:17.013 --> 18:20.600
and who tried to capture you...
The mastermind behind all that...

18:22.226 --> 18:23.644
is probably that man.

18:29.734 --> 18:31.235
See, what did I tell you?

18:31.694 --> 18:35.698
You're right. They're using one
of those new tracking devices, huh?

18:36.115 --> 18:37.783
That's why we can't find them.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.995
The module doesn't use GPS.

18:41.537 --> 18:44.457
It pinpoints location
using only cell phone base stations.

18:44.540 --> 18:47.001
It's the method
for pinpointing earthquake epicenters.

18:47.084 --> 18:48.836
-What can you do?
-Don't worry.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.881
It accesses the map
when it receives an alert.

18:52.632 --> 18:53.966
See? There it is.

18:54.050 --> 18:56.218
I'll go confirm it. That's okay, right?

18:57.928 --> 18:58.763
Understood.

18:59.722 --> 19:02.892
Can you swear to me
that you won't lay a hand on him?

19:04.977 --> 19:06.270
Of course.

19:12.985 --> 19:16.238
I knew it, that dish
is this island's local specialty!

19:17.365 --> 19:20.618
Is Keith really gonna be
in a place like this, though?

19:20.910 --> 19:22.995
I didn't get ahead of myself, did I?

19:25.581 --> 19:27.208
Two chicken gumbos.

19:27.708 --> 19:28.542
You got it.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.212
Two gumbos, make 'em cluck!

19:32.129 --> 19:34.882
This place has the best gumbo around
these days.

19:36.092 --> 19:38.344
You still haven't told me about Man Two.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.473
That one's got nothing to do with you.

19:42.556 --> 19:43.808
I want to know anyway.

19:43.891 --> 19:46.769
Well, maybe you ought to know.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.855
Is he the man who killed your sister?

19:52.191 --> 19:54.026
-Is he--
-He's human.

19:55.236 --> 19:56.070
He's human?

19:56.153 --> 19:58.823
Yeah, I know. It doesn't add up.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.116
MAN ONE: DEMIHUMAN

20:00.199 --> 20:03.411
If Man One is a demihuman
with brainwashing abilities,

20:03.494 --> 20:05.955
it's weird that Man Two would be human.

20:06.163 --> 20:10.167
He'd just need to compel him,
so I don't get why they would partner up.

20:10.251 --> 20:11.085
MAN TWO: HUMAN

20:11.168 --> 20:15.172
So what you're saying is,
you have an idea of who Man Two is.

20:15.256 --> 20:17.174
WHY DOESN'T MAN ONE BRAINWASH MAN TWO?

20:17.258 --> 20:19.385
MAN TWO HAS ABILITY
THAT PREVENTS BRAINWASHING

20:19.468 --> 20:20.803
WHAT IS THAT ABILITY?

20:20.886 --> 20:21.887
WHO IS MAN TWO?

20:21.971 --> 20:23.889
IT HAS TO BE HIM
MAN TWO IS HIM.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.558
I have my suspicions.

20:26.642 --> 20:29.562
That's why I have to make certain
for myself.

20:31.814 --> 20:33.566
All right. I'll work with you.

20:34.275 --> 20:38.487
I'll kill Man One.
I'll avenge Dr. Heath's death.

20:39.822 --> 20:42.658
Tell me. Where is Yuna?

20:46.787 --> 20:49.248
They're hiding among the light
of the stars.

20:51.709 --> 20:53.627
Fly towards Canopus.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.213
Canopus?

21:03.596 --> 21:06.807
What do you think you're doing here?

21:07.683 --> 21:10.352
Er... You see... I can explain.

21:10.436 --> 21:11.562
Not so fast!

21:15.649 --> 21:18.778
I tracked you down
by asking just two freaking people.

21:20.905 --> 21:23.657
Why didn't you tell me
that you knew each other?

21:23.991 --> 21:26.243
It never seemed to be the right time.

21:27.244 --> 21:31.081
This is one surprise twist
we ain't gonna weasel out of with a joke.

21:31.165 --> 21:32.666
Don't make this my fault!

21:33.042 --> 21:34.585
Are you two listening?

21:35.085 --> 21:35.920
Koku!

21:36.003 --> 21:36.837
Yes!

21:36.921 --> 21:39.757
What's going on here?
How do you know this geezer?

21:40.090 --> 21:41.383
My younger brother.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.470
I had no idea until just recently.

21:45.387 --> 21:46.222
Is this true?

21:48.057 --> 21:48.891
It is.

21:49.475 --> 21:53.103
Look me in the eye and swear it.
This is the truth, right?

21:54.355 --> 21:58.484
I asked him to pick up some things.
I didn't have anyone else to turn to.

21:59.235 --> 22:02.154
Us being together is just temporary.

22:02.530 --> 22:04.824
You two don't look anything alike!

22:04.907 --> 22:09.495
We're only half brothers. I take
after my dad, but he takes after his mom.

22:10.454 --> 22:14.250
So you have another sibling besides
your sister who doesn't resemble you.

22:16.585 --> 22:19.922
Yeah, I know about her.
Boris told me everything.

22:20.631 --> 22:23.133
I saw her formula portrait
on your ceiling.

22:24.093 --> 22:26.804
So don't you dare
keep playing dumb with me.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.312
He always looks down on me.

22:36.855 --> 22:38.941
I can handle him just fine by myself.

22:40.234 --> 22:42.361
Just you watch, Minatsuki.

22:43.904 --> 22:47.157
I have a good idea
of why you might not like me.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.744
I'm short, have black hair,
am left-handed and Asian.

22:51.829 --> 22:55.499
It's because I remind you of Erika.
That's why, isn't it?

22:58.294 --> 23:01.046
If you don't want to answer, fine.

23:01.338 --> 23:02.172
But...

23:02.798 --> 23:05.134
if your end goal for all this is revenge,

23:05.426 --> 23:09.179
then as a servant of a lawful country,
I can't let you do it.

23:09.263 --> 23:10.097
Besides--

23:15.394 --> 23:17.605
What, what, what, what's going on?

23:19.815 --> 23:21.984
I can do this all by myself!

23:27.406 --> 23:28.949
What's going on?

23:48.844 --> 23:50.846
Koku?

23:52.014 --> 23:53.641
Lily, listen closely.

23:53.849 --> 23:56.352
If we survive, I'll tell you everything.
