WEBVTT

00:06.382 --> 00:08.342
From the handiwork
done to Kliner's neck,

00:08.426 --> 00:10.928
it's clear the South Americans
are from Venezuela.

00:12.596 --> 00:13.723
How do you know that?

00:13.723 --> 00:15.891
That's
a Venezuelan butterfly cut.

00:15.975 --> 00:18.728
Makes you asphyxiate
and bleed out simultaneously,

00:18.728 --> 00:20.312
so you effectively drown
in your own blood.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.858
Kliner must've had someone
in Venezuela.

00:23.858 --> 00:26.902
Someone he was working with...
or for.

00:26.986 --> 00:29.321
Someone who's not happy with
how messy this has all become.

00:29.405 --> 00:31.407
Someone with enough juice
to take out

00:31.407 --> 00:32.992
the person we thought
was the boss.

00:32.992 --> 00:36.162
A wise, gigantic man

00:36.162 --> 00:37.955
"You don't put down
a junkyard dog

00:37.955 --> 00:40.833
unless you know you have
a just-as-nasty backup hound."

00:40.833 --> 00:43.127
Think they sent enforcement
up from Venezuela

00:43.127 --> 00:44.503
to keep the trains running
on time?

00:44.587 --> 00:46.756
It's possible.

00:46.756 --> 00:48.632
When was the last time
you were on a stakeout?

00:48.716 --> 00:50.384
Kliner compound?

00:50.468 --> 00:52.845
Change in leadership
can result in mistakes.

00:52.845 --> 00:55.222
If it does, I want to be
watching when it happens.

00:55.306 --> 00:57.683
We'll need a car.

00:57.767 --> 01:01.270
Everyone in town knows mine,
and your Bentley isn't subtle.

01:01.270 --> 01:03.397
I'll take care of it.

01:04.607 --> 01:06.692
It's the station house.

01:06.776 --> 01:09.069
The dung has officially
hit the fan.

01:09.153 --> 01:10.863
"The dung."

01:10.863 --> 01:12.698
Just curse, Finlay.

01:26.712 --> 01:29.381
<i></i>

01:29.465 --> 01:31.967
Stevenson,
track down the security footage

01:32.051 --> 01:33.385
from the traffic cameras
at the end of Route 4

01:33.469 --> 01:35.012
heading to Kliner's property.

01:35.012 --> 01:38.390
And-and try and drum up some
of that Google satellite shit.

01:38.474 --> 01:41.227
I... I don't think
that's how Google works, sir.

01:41.227 --> 01:43.354
The people of Margrave are
losing their minds, son.

01:43.354 --> 01:45.272
- Just get it done.
- Yes, sir.

01:45.356 --> 01:46.941
Hey, Baker.

01:46.941 --> 01:48.984
Let's prepare a statement, uh...

01:49.068 --> 01:53.197
We are still in the, uh,
information gathering stages...

01:54.698 --> 01:57.076
Et cetera, et cetera.

01:58.244 --> 02:00.037
Everything we're working on,
including Morrison,

02:00.037 --> 02:02.039
is back-burnered till we get
a handle on this situation.

02:02.039 --> 02:03.833
- Where was he found?
- Office.

02:03.833 --> 02:05.793
Secretary discovered him
this morning.

02:05.793 --> 02:08.087
Okay. Assume county forensics
are already there?

02:08.087 --> 02:11.048
- They find anything?
- Nothing yet.

02:11.048 --> 02:13.175
I'll head over.

02:13.259 --> 02:16.345
- You still think my dad's guilty, you piece of shit?!
- Easy. Easy.

02:16.345 --> 02:18.055
Easy.

02:18.055 --> 02:19.765
Get your fucking hands off me!

02:19.849 --> 02:21.141
Now, I'm gonna give you
a do-over,

02:21.225 --> 02:22.685
considering the circumstances.

02:22.685 --> 02:24.979
But when I let you go,
if you take another swing,

02:24.979 --> 02:28.274
this goes in a different
direction real fast.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.069
- No, no, no, no. Settle down, settle down.
- You fuck!

02:32.069 --> 02:34.446
You went after my father
for murder.

02:34.530 --> 02:37.241
You tried to sully the name
and reputation of a man

02:37.241 --> 02:39.535
who has done nothing
but give to this community.

02:39.535 --> 02:42.663
I know you're emotional,
and I'm sorry for your loss, KJ,

02:42.663 --> 02:45.541
but I've never done anything
in this town but my job.

02:45.541 --> 02:49.044
Fuck you, carpetbagger.

02:49.128 --> 02:50.504
Oh, get in my office.

02:56.135 --> 02:59.013
Maybe you should get some air.

02:59.013 --> 03:01.473
And-and hold off going to
the crime scene just yet

03:01.557 --> 03:03.893
till things cool down.

03:03.893 --> 03:06.312
I'm sorry, did you just tell
your chief detective to wait

03:06.312 --> 03:07.688
for a crime scene to go cold?

03:07.688 --> 03:10.274
I told my chief detective
to take a beat.

03:10.274 --> 03:12.651
You accused this town's
fairy-fucking-godfather

03:12.735 --> 03:14.486
of homicide
only to find out he's a victim

03:14.570 --> 03:16.363
like all the others.

03:16.447 --> 03:18.949
You don't have a lot of goodwill
'round here right now.

03:19.033 --> 03:21.160
I'm doing you a favor.

03:21.160 --> 03:23.162
So hit the bench,

03:23.162 --> 03:25.706
I'll call you back in the game
soon enough.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.143
That's quite a vehicle.

03:46.143 --> 03:47.603
It gets me from A to B.

03:47.603 --> 03:48.812
Got to be honest,

03:48.896 --> 03:51.148
I'm not too familiar
with British cars.

03:51.148 --> 03:52.942
Just need the windows tinted.

03:52.942 --> 03:55.361
Three days, at least.

03:55.361 --> 03:56.946
I guess I'll need a loaner,
then.

03:56.946 --> 03:58.906
Yeah, we don't do loaners.

04:01.075 --> 04:02.159
You sure?

04:08.457 --> 04:11.126
Guess you could take my car
for the time being.

04:12.586 --> 04:16.006
It ain't a Bentley, but, uh,
it'll get you from A to B.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.884
It's perfect.

04:20.886 --> 04:22.888
birds chirping]

04:29.853 --> 04:31.689
I usually get Romas.

04:31.689 --> 04:33.899
And these ain't ready yet.

04:33.983 --> 04:36.735
Maybe next week they'll make
a decent sandwich.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.867
How do you do it, Mr. Mosley?

04:45.035 --> 04:46.245
Do what?

04:46.245 --> 04:48.622
Stay here.

04:48.706 --> 04:49.999
In Margrave.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.335
You never thought it might be
easier somewhere else?

04:53.419 --> 04:56.130
Thought it?
I knew it.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.382
So why stay?

04:59.967 --> 05:03.137
My family's been here
longer than the Kliners,

05:03.137 --> 05:05.222
longer than the Teales
and just as long

05:05.222 --> 05:07.975
as Miss Roscoe's kin.

05:07.975 --> 05:12.855
Now, why should I let anyone
drive me from my town?

05:12.855 --> 05:17.067
Only way they're pushing me
and my sister out is in caskets.

05:17.151 --> 05:20.821
Even then, we'll be
in Margrave Cemetery.

05:20.821 --> 05:24.324
Uh, the question ain't
why I'm still here,

05:24.408 --> 05:27.244
it-it's why you ever came
here in the first place.

05:27.244 --> 05:32.708
Margrave's a long way
from Harvard Square, Detective.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.128
Reacher asked me the same thing.

05:39.131 --> 05:41.675
Same as I'm gonna tell you.

05:43.635 --> 05:45.679
It's none of your business.

05:51.685 --> 05:55.522
Next time bring me Romas.

05:55.606 --> 05:57.775
Will do.

06:13.415 --> 06:14.708
Is it over?

06:14.792 --> 06:16.126
No.

06:16.210 --> 06:17.377
But I brought some backup.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.174
Roscoe.

06:22.174 --> 06:23.675
- Oh.
- A little piece of Margrave.

06:23.759 --> 06:25.344
You hanging on?

06:26.929 --> 06:28.680
I'm hanging on by a thread.

06:30.099 --> 06:32.267
Hope you know how to play
<i>Settlers of Catan.</i>

06:32.351 --> 06:35.020
- It's Board Game Central in here.
- That's good.

06:35.104 --> 06:37.689
- Keeping 'em busy.
- For now. They're scared.

06:37.773 --> 06:40.234
I-I mean, I'm scared, too.

06:40.234 --> 06:42.236
Where are my manners?
Get you some water.

06:42.236 --> 06:44.029
Thank you.

06:44.113 --> 06:46.657
She's a total mess.

06:47.991 --> 06:51.286
This place was used
for a mob witness once.

06:51.370 --> 06:53.622
Door's been reinforced,
good alarm system,

06:53.622 --> 06:54.748
but use your instincts.

06:54.832 --> 06:55.958
You feel any danger,

06:55.958 --> 06:57.459
you grab that family
and you run.

07:00.337 --> 07:01.839
All right, I'm gonna hit it.

07:01.839 --> 07:03.674
I'll be in touch
in a couple days.

07:03.674 --> 07:05.843
Oh, that's okay. I have to go.

07:05.843 --> 07:07.594
- Now, what are the rules?
- Thank you.

07:07.678 --> 07:09.138
Both locks,
no lights when we're sleeping,

07:09.138 --> 07:11.557
- and don't use the fireplace.
- Good job.

07:11.557 --> 07:12.975
You're gonna get through this.

07:15.310 --> 07:16.645
Thank you.

07:18.355 --> 07:19.606
Thank you for everything
you have done.

07:19.690 --> 07:21.984
I'm leaving you in good hands.

08:07.613 --> 08:09.281
Beef jerky?

08:09.281 --> 08:11.033
In an enclosed space?

08:11.033 --> 08:13.619
Protein, iron, zinc.

08:13.619 --> 08:15.495
Doesn't spike your insulin.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.916
I love jerky.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.420
Neagley introduced me to the good stuff.

08:30.802 --> 08:33.055
So, Neagley.

08:33.055 --> 08:35.224
She's a friend?

08:35.224 --> 08:37.184
We served together in the 110th.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.102
So she's a friend.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.812
I-I guess you can call her that.

08:40.896 --> 08:43.732
I did call her that.
Why can't you call her that?

08:44.775 --> 08:46.401
I call her Neagley.

08:52.783 --> 08:54.326
So, what's the deal
with the 110th?

08:54.326 --> 08:56.370
Long story.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.164
You got somewhere to be?

09:02.834 --> 09:06.421
Army let me put together my own
special investigations unit.

09:06.505 --> 09:07.923
Pentagon thought it would fail,

09:07.923 --> 09:09.925
which is why they put me
in charge.

09:09.925 --> 09:11.301
There were nine of us.

09:11.385 --> 09:12.511
Where are the rest of them?

09:12.511 --> 09:13.762
No idea.

09:13.762 --> 09:16.431
- You weren't close?
- Very close.

09:17.474 --> 09:18.892
Went through a lot together.

09:19.977 --> 09:21.561
But that's
when I was in the army.

09:21.645 --> 09:22.729
And now?

09:24.523 --> 09:26.108
I'm not in the army.

09:35.993 --> 09:38.120
Barely talk to your brother
for years.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.580
Fall out of touch
with your army buddies.

09:40.664 --> 09:42.708
How do you let go of people
so easily?

09:42.708 --> 09:44.543
It's not healthy.

09:44.543 --> 09:46.003
You're one to talk.

09:46.003 --> 09:47.838
Move on, Finlay.

09:47.838 --> 09:50.007
I've seen trees lose rings
faster than you.

09:54.386 --> 09:56.513
My wife's dead.

09:58.724 --> 10:02.311
She died, and I can't stop
wearing the ring.

10:02.311 --> 10:03.854
That's not what you told me.

10:03.854 --> 10:05.647
All I told you was
her name was Sharon.

10:05.731 --> 10:08.525
Never said you were right
about us being divorced.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.319
Well, why didn't you correct me?

10:10.319 --> 10:13.030
I don't correct anyone.

10:13.030 --> 10:15.157
I don't need anyone's pity.

10:16.742 --> 10:20.579
Everyone just assumes,
a man like me,

10:20.579 --> 10:23.749
grumpy, set in his ways...

10:23.749 --> 10:25.083
Pain in the ass.

10:25.167 --> 10:26.960
Pain in the butt.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.839
They just figure
she walked out on me.

10:33.425 --> 10:35.135
Is that why you left Boston?

10:37.846 --> 10:42.517
You try living in a city where
every place you look's a memory

10:42.601 --> 10:44.353
of the love of your life.

10:44.353 --> 10:48.106
Every restaurant,
every stop on the T,

10:48.190 --> 10:50.650
all a kick in the gut.

10:52.194 --> 10:53.820
A reminder of how I failed her.

10:53.904 --> 10:55.947
Is that what you tell yourself?

10:56.031 --> 10:58.116
I promised her
I'd move heaven and earth

10:58.200 --> 11:00.535
to make sure she got better.

11:05.665 --> 11:09.378
Now I pay a mobile bill
each month,

11:09.378 --> 11:11.713
so I can hear her
on the voice mail.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.424
So, you're living
above a smoke shop

11:14.508 --> 11:15.967
when you're trying
to quit smoking?

11:16.051 --> 11:18.553
Wearing a tweed suit
in Georgia in the summer?

11:18.637 --> 11:20.639
Taking a job
in the middle of nowhere?

11:20.639 --> 11:22.182
It's all some kind of penance

11:22.182 --> 11:23.934
for you not being able
to save your wife?

11:24.976 --> 11:26.686
Something like that.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.860
Well, that's stupid.

11:33.944 --> 11:36.655
And if you really think that,
you're stupid.

11:38.156 --> 11:39.741
Fuck you.

11:40.867 --> 11:43.745
I like it when you curse.
You should do that more often.

11:44.913 --> 11:47.040
Double fuck you twice.

11:55.090 --> 11:56.675
Something's happening.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.980
Kliner was murdered
less than 24 hours ago,

12:09.980 --> 12:11.857
now his nephew's out
making deliveries?

12:13.400 --> 12:15.360
Counterfeit reserves
are running low

12:15.444 --> 12:17.195
thanks to
the coast guard blockade.

12:17.279 --> 12:18.447
Tensions are up.

12:18.447 --> 12:20.949
Buyer wants
their counterfeit cash.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.869
That truck could be full of it.

12:25.495 --> 12:26.872
Let's find out.

12:30.208 --> 12:32.669
Oh, my goodness.
It's almost midnight already.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.045
You two, brush your teeth

12:34.129 --> 12:35.881
and maybe we can play
another game.

12:38.341 --> 12:40.010
Another game?

12:40.010 --> 12:41.219
Don't they get tired?

12:41.303 --> 12:43.138
Yeah, I mean,
I try to keep 'em up.

12:43.138 --> 12:44.556
They go to asleep,
the nightmares start.

12:44.556 --> 12:45.765
They miss their dad.

12:47.601 --> 12:48.810
I used to get nightmares.

12:50.479 --> 12:52.272
I, uh...

12:52.272 --> 12:55.275
I lost my dad
when I was a kid, too.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.902
Him and my mom, both.

12:56.902 --> 12:58.612
God, what happened?

12:58.612 --> 13:00.697
It was a car accident.

13:00.697 --> 13:03.408
I was in the back.
It was a miracle I survived.

13:03.492 --> 13:05.577
That's awful.

13:08.622 --> 13:10.373
After,
when I was in the hospital,

13:10.457 --> 13:14.044
my, uh, my meemaw would
read me <i>Harry Potter.</i>

13:14.044 --> 13:16.713
'Cause Harry gets told that his
parents died in a car accident,

13:16.713 --> 13:20.884
but really they're wizards
who died trying to save him

13:20.884 --> 13:24.137
and make the world
a better place, so...

13:24.221 --> 13:26.973
I'd lie to myself and pretend
that my parents were wizards

13:27.057 --> 13:28.850
who died trying to do
those same things.

13:28.934 --> 13:32.479
And you wanted to be like them.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.564
Is that why you became a cop?

13:35.982 --> 13:37.859
That was the idea.

13:42.197 --> 13:43.823
You know, they're gonna be okay.

13:43.907 --> 13:46.243
Kids are resilient.

13:46.243 --> 13:48.537
And they are lucky to have you.

13:50.121 --> 13:52.457
Thank you.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.257
What's going on?

14:00.257 --> 14:01.841
What do you see?

14:04.970 --> 14:06.304
Fuck.

14:07.722 --> 14:10.100
Get the girls' shoes on
and wait by the cellar door.

14:14.229 --> 14:16.106
You hear me yell,

14:16.106 --> 14:18.817
you take off for the woods
and don't stop running.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.654
And...
we're in Tennessee.

14:22.654 --> 14:25.532
Guy hasn't taken so much
as a bathroom break.

14:27.784 --> 14:30.829
Hey, drive back,
you're getting too close.

14:30.829 --> 14:32.289
I'm fine.

14:32.289 --> 14:35.000
You have to hang back further
than a normal tail.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.459
My distance is perfect.

14:36.543 --> 14:39.045
You're a giraffe
in a Grand Caravan. Drop back.

14:39.129 --> 14:40.630
You know how many times
I've tailed someone?

14:40.714 --> 14:41.881
I've been watching you
for hours,

14:41.965 --> 14:43.174
and based on
how you've been doing it,

14:43.258 --> 14:44.384
I'd say not that many times.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.303
Just sit there
and wear your suit.

14:46.303 --> 14:49.389
Here's T-Bone Walker
with "Goin' to Chicago Blues."

14:49.389 --> 14:52.767
Come on.
I can't take another blues song.

14:52.851 --> 14:55.061
This is T-Bone Walker.

14:55.145 --> 14:56.980
Founding father of one of
the most unique

14:56.980 --> 14:58.607
African American art forms.

14:58.607 --> 15:01.026
I thought T-Bone was white.
You sure he was Black?

15:01.026 --> 15:04.362
T-Bone Burnett was white.
Walker was Black.

15:04.446 --> 15:05.989
Come on, Finlay.

15:05.989 --> 15:08.950
There's got to be
something else.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.535
Let's see what they got here.

15:11.578 --> 15:14.039
No. No.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.460
Here we go.

15:18.460 --> 15:22.756
<i>Carry on, my wayward son ♪</i>

15:22.756 --> 15:26.885
Best opening
to any rock song ever.

15:26.885 --> 15:31.514
<i>Lay your weary head to rest ♪</i>

15:31.598 --> 15:34.309
<i>Don't you cry no more ♪</i>

15:37.687 --> 15:40.315
What are you...
What are you doing?

15:40.315 --> 15:42.817
Got to say,
white guys don't get their due.

15:42.901 --> 15:44.819
They can rock out.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.243
He's changing lanes.
Exit up ahead.

15:52.327 --> 15:53.662
On it.

15:55.997 --> 15:59.167
<i>Ah ♪</i>♪

16:38.957 --> 16:41.209
Shit.

16:49.634 --> 16:51.094
Run!

17:19.456 --> 17:22.417
Over here. Over here.

17:22.417 --> 17:24.753
Get down to the brush. Hide.

17:24.753 --> 17:26.796
Okay. I'm gonna lure them away.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.132
- No.
- Yes. Do it.

17:29.132 --> 17:31.676
There's a fire road
not too far east from here.

17:31.760 --> 17:34.429
- Meet me at the first mile marker you come to. Hide.
- Okay.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.558
Don't move.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.694
Long drive,
emotional day.

19:12.694 --> 19:14.988
He'll be asleep
within two minutes.

19:21.744 --> 19:23.162
What about that guy?

19:27.292 --> 19:29.168
What am I, an eagle?

19:35.758 --> 19:37.260
Half asleep.

19:37.260 --> 19:39.679
His monitor's blocking his view
to the parking lot anyway.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.934
Let's do this.

19:49.439 --> 19:51.316
Keep lookout.
I'll pick the lock.

19:51.316 --> 19:52.734
Rolling up that door
will make a racket.

19:52.734 --> 19:55.111
I got a better idea.

19:55.111 --> 19:57.280
- What are you gonna do?
- Tops of these trucks are made

19:57.280 --> 19:59.115
with thin vinyl
to reduce the weight.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.306
Keep it down.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.236
Reacher.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.156
Reacher.

20:41.866 --> 20:42.867
What?

22:29.849 --> 22:32.310
I'll call Tennessee authorities,

22:32.310 --> 22:34.771
- have this thing impounded within the hour.
- No point.

22:35.813 --> 22:37.940
Truck's empty.

22:44.572 --> 22:46.407
If you have any idea
what's going on,

22:46.491 --> 22:47.909
feel free to share.

22:47.909 --> 22:49.619
We got it wrong.

22:49.619 --> 22:51.120
He wasn't shipping money out.

22:51.204 --> 22:52.455
Well, what is he doing?

22:52.455 --> 22:55.124
Besides driving around for hours
to deliver nothing.

22:55.208 --> 22:57.585
I don't know, but Joe did.

22:59.087 --> 23:00.797
Joe can't help us now, Reacher.

23:02.298 --> 23:04.759
So we talk to the people
who were helping Joe.

23:04.759 --> 23:05.885
The professors.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.386
They're unreachable.

23:07.470 --> 23:09.639
Not anymore. Should've landed
a few hours ago.

23:11.099 --> 23:12.433
How did you know that?
You didn't even

23:12.517 --> 23:14.143
look at your watch.

23:14.227 --> 23:15.645
It's predawn, so...

23:15.645 --> 23:17.605
Guess we'll just leave a message.

23:17.605 --> 23:19.357
Hopefully somebody... <i>- Hello?</i>

23:19.357 --> 23:21.984
Oh, hey. Sorry.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.778
Was looking for William Bryant?

23:23.778 --> 23:25.154
<i>Uh, who is this?</i>

23:25.238 --> 23:29.325
A former student,
looking to reconnect.

23:29.325 --> 23:30.952
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

23:30.952 --> 23:33.621
I honestly don't even know
how to say this, he...

23:34.622 --> 23:36.833
Professor Bryant was killed
this morning.

23:38.209 --> 23:39.293
What happened?

23:39.377 --> 23:40.837
<i>He was mugged.</i>

23:40.837 --> 23:42.755
<i>Got back from a late flight,</i>

23:42.839 --> 23:44.715
<i>took his dog for a walk, and...</i>

23:45.758 --> 23:47.718
I'm his assistant.

23:47.802 --> 23:50.346
I was here working on a paper
through the night.

23:50.346 --> 23:54.142
<i>And now I'm sitting here numb
since I heard the news.</i>

23:54.142 --> 23:56.644
I'm sorry.
My condolences.

23:56.644 --> 23:58.813
<i>Thank you.
I have to go.</i>

23:58.813 --> 24:00.565
They got to him fast.

24:00.565 --> 24:02.483
Let's hope they didn't get
to both.

24:14.996 --> 24:17.123
<i>It's 5:00 a.m.
This better be good.</i>

24:17.123 --> 24:18.374
Professor Castillo?

24:18.374 --> 24:19.959
<i>Yes.</i>

24:19.959 --> 24:21.085
This is Jack Reacher.

24:21.169 --> 24:23.421
You were working
with my brother Joe.

24:23.421 --> 24:24.755
I'm coming to New York.

24:24.839 --> 24:26.257
Now do everything
I'm about to tell you

24:26.257 --> 24:28.843
if you still want to be alive
by the time I get there.

24:39.520 --> 24:40.521
Charlie?

24:42.440 --> 24:43.983
Charlie?

24:46.694 --> 24:48.571
It's safe.

24:48.571 --> 24:50.323
They won't be coming after us.

24:51.365 --> 24:52.825
Thank you.

24:52.909 --> 24:54.076
Girls.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.329
Girls, come on. It's okay.

24:56.329 --> 24:58.080
It's okay.
She twisted her ankle.

24:58.164 --> 24:59.373
Come on.

24:59.457 --> 25:01.876
The bad news is
we got to keep walking.

25:01.876 --> 25:03.544
I'm gonna call Picard,
have him meet us at a diner

25:03.628 --> 25:05.963
I saw on my way in.
It's a few miles up the road,

25:06.047 --> 25:07.673
but it's gonna be safer
in public.

25:07.757 --> 25:10.134
We'll hike through
the tree line, stay hidden.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.012
You rolled that ankle good,
didn't you?

25:13.012 --> 25:14.931
Tell you what...

25:17.058 --> 25:19.310
All aboard the Conklin Express.

25:20.436 --> 25:21.354
You okay?

25:21.354 --> 25:22.772
Ready? One, two, three.

25:22.772 --> 25:24.899
Get up there. Good job.

25:24.899 --> 25:26.359
Okay.

25:28.653 --> 25:30.238
Who's tougher than
the Hubble ladies?

25:35.243 --> 25:36.535
Nobody.

25:36.619 --> 25:38.204
That is damn right.

25:39.247 --> 25:40.164
Let's move.

25:40.248 --> 25:42.375
Okay. Come on.

25:46.587 --> 25:48.130
Watch your head.

26:00.768 --> 26:04.605
Yeah, probably wouldn't have
gotten this past TSA.

26:06.065 --> 26:10.111
If you reach out to Picard,
see how everyone's holding up.

26:12.196 --> 26:14.448
Roscoe's tough.

26:14.532 --> 26:16.200
I'm sure she's fine.

26:30.131 --> 26:32.466
Here. Just keep that there.

26:32.550 --> 26:33.676
Okay.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.054
They're out cold.

26:38.306 --> 26:41.684
It's, uh, it's fear
more than exertion.

26:41.684 --> 26:43.602
Adrenaline like that
knocks you right out.

26:46.230 --> 26:49.233
I don't know how we got here.

26:49.317 --> 26:50.860
We aren't bad people.

26:50.860 --> 26:52.778
I know that.

26:55.823 --> 26:56.907
Charlie...

26:58.326 --> 27:00.119
I have to tell you something.

27:04.040 --> 27:06.042
You've been manipulated.

27:06.042 --> 27:10.463
Paul left his job at
Axis Financial over a year ago.

27:10.463 --> 27:12.465
He hasn't been working
at the bank ever since then.

27:12.465 --> 27:15.343
Everything he told you...

27:15.343 --> 27:16.510
was a lie.

27:16.594 --> 27:18.721
Whatever's going on...

27:20.264 --> 27:22.016
...he was involved.

27:28.856 --> 27:31.484
I have known...

27:31.484 --> 27:35.279
exactly where my husband
has been working,

27:35.363 --> 27:38.616
and not working,
every day of his life.

27:44.121 --> 27:45.456
You said you didn't know
anything.

27:45.456 --> 27:47.833
I was protecting my family.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.713
But since we were just shot at
in a forest,

27:52.797 --> 27:54.423
I'd say that ship has sailed.

27:56.133 --> 27:58.052
Do you want to hear
how our lives were ruined,

27:58.052 --> 27:59.553
Officer Conklin?

28:01.722 --> 28:04.809
Considering I was shot at, too,
I think I'm owed that courtesy.

28:08.646 --> 28:11.399
Mr. Kliner wanted to meet Paul.

28:11.399 --> 28:13.442
Paul was excited.

28:13.526 --> 28:15.611
<i>Kliner's an important man.</i>

28:15.611 --> 28:16.821
Sit.

28:19.532 --> 28:20.616
Paul.

28:21.826 --> 28:25.246
My business deals almost
exclusively in manufacturing.

28:25.246 --> 28:28.124
Consequently, I deal
with suppliers and vendors

28:28.124 --> 28:31.502
who offer me favorable terms
if I can operate in cash.

28:31.502 --> 28:34.088
It's all legal and aboveboard
on my end.

28:34.088 --> 28:36.841
Now, whether those guys declare
what I pay them...

28:36.841 --> 28:39.218
well, that's
between them and the IRS.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.262
Okay, I-I still don't see

28:41.262 --> 28:43.764
how someone like me can help
your company.

28:44.807 --> 28:47.476
I need expertise moving
hard currency around

28:47.560 --> 28:49.895
as a way to ensure
those favorable terms.

28:49.979 --> 28:52.690
Well, word around town is
that you've been interviewing

28:52.690 --> 28:54.733
for positions
at other institutions.

28:54.817 --> 28:58.821
I would love to throw Kliner
Industries' hat in the ring.

28:59.864 --> 29:03.868
That's incredibly flattering.

29:03.868 --> 29:08.497
I've-I've really only worked
in traditional finance, though.

29:08.581 --> 29:11.792
Um, you know, for banks.

29:11.876 --> 29:15.004
Yeah. I understand
your hesitation.

29:15.004 --> 29:18.507
It's something new, unexplored.

29:19.592 --> 29:21.886
That's what makes life exciting,
right?

29:23.471 --> 29:25.097
Yes.

29:25.181 --> 29:27.308
So...

29:29.435 --> 29:31.145
This is what I'm thinking.

29:31.145 --> 29:34.273
I got a big client
in Venezuela.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.609
Why don't you come down with me
next week.

29:36.609 --> 29:39.069
Check out his operation,
see how things work.

29:39.153 --> 29:41.447
Corporate culture, all that.

29:41.447 --> 29:44.783
See if this is a line of work
that might be up your alley.

29:44.867 --> 29:46.827
I'll pay you generously
for your time.

29:47.870 --> 29:49.538
Two weeks' pay...

29:50.581 --> 29:51.999
...one day's work.

30:00.216 --> 30:03.344
Paul never should
have gone to Venezuela.

30:03.344 --> 30:05.012
So...

30:05.012 --> 30:06.263
How was lunch?

30:06.347 --> 30:08.766
I'm a sucker for plantains.

30:08.766 --> 30:10.267
Me, too.

30:10.351 --> 30:13.103
I got to watch myself
around those things.

30:13.187 --> 30:15.439
- And the work?
- Good.

30:15.523 --> 30:19.401
Uh, I mean, your client's needs
are significant,

30:19.485 --> 30:21.779
but, uh, I think I put
a dent in it.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.366
- May I?
- Of course.

30:28.577 --> 30:30.788
You were able to move that much
currency in just a few hours?

30:32.706 --> 30:34.500
You sure this was all legal?

30:34.500 --> 30:36.544
A hundred percent.

30:36.544 --> 30:38.504
I'm just real good at my job.

30:38.504 --> 30:40.005
That's for damn sure.

30:40.089 --> 30:42.675
Can you send those, uh,
transfer confirmations to me?

30:42.675 --> 30:44.468
Of course.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.515
Done.

30:49.515 --> 30:50.766
Look, Paul.

30:50.766 --> 30:52.393
I want you at my company.

30:52.393 --> 30:54.895
I need you at my company.

30:54.979 --> 30:57.815
And I don't want to waste time
and I don't want to negotiate.

30:57.815 --> 30:59.900
I'll pay you four times
your current salary

30:59.984 --> 31:02.570
plus a 50% year-end kicker.

31:04.572 --> 31:06.574
But before the ink can dry
on this,

31:06.574 --> 31:08.576
you know,
my client wants to meet you.

31:08.576 --> 31:10.828
It's about a half mile walk
to his horse farm.

31:10.828 --> 31:12.538
Come on,
it's beautiful country.

31:12.538 --> 31:13.872
It'll be good to stretch
your legs.

31:13.956 --> 31:15.749
Let's do it.

31:18.419 --> 31:22.172
- You like horses, Paul?
- I do.

31:26.051 --> 31:27.595
Are these all
racehorses?

31:27.595 --> 31:29.722
Mostly retired.

31:29.722 --> 31:32.558
They're just here to eat,
sleep and...

31:32.558 --> 31:34.768
well,
fuck out new champions.

31:34.852 --> 31:36.395
Yeah.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.647
- Not a bad life.
- Oh, they love it.

31:38.731 --> 31:40.441
But not at first.

31:40.441 --> 31:42.318
No, these are animals
that are used to running

31:42.318 --> 31:44.111
as hard and as fast
as they can,

31:44.111 --> 31:46.739
racing and training
and training and racing.

31:46.739 --> 31:50.284
And then, one day,
they're locked in a stall,

31:50.284 --> 31:52.494
and they revolt.

31:52.578 --> 31:55.456
They bite.
They gnaw at the gate.

31:55.456 --> 31:59.710
They slam against the walls
trying to break 'em down.

31:59.710 --> 32:03.088
And then, one day...

32:03.172 --> 32:05.257
they just stop.

32:06.300 --> 32:09.053
They just stop.

32:09.053 --> 32:12.264
- You want to know why?
- Okay.

32:12.348 --> 32:14.224
Because they accept
that they're trapped.

32:14.308 --> 32:17.227
They know there's nothing they
can do to escape their fate.

32:18.312 --> 32:22.191
And they realize that
their new life isn't that bad.

32:23.275 --> 32:24.943
You know why
I'm telling you this?

32:26.278 --> 32:27.488
No.

32:27.488 --> 32:29.198
That money that you moved today,

32:29.198 --> 32:32.117
you may have tried
to do everything legally,

32:32.201 --> 32:34.286
but that was an impossible task,

32:34.370 --> 32:36.205
because every cent
of every dollar was tied

32:36.205 --> 32:38.290
to an international
counterfeiting scheme

32:38.374 --> 32:40.167
of which you are now part.

32:41.210 --> 32:43.337
I'm able to pay you
so far above market value,

32:43.337 --> 32:47.424
because, frankly,
I'm my own printing press.

32:48.509 --> 32:52.179
You're-you're kidding.

32:52.179 --> 32:53.931
This is a joke.

32:53.931 --> 32:58.602
This is as serious a situation
as you've ever been in, Paul.

32:58.686 --> 33:02.439
You helped me launder millions
in illegal tender,

33:02.523 --> 33:03.774
and then you sent me
the evidence.

33:03.774 --> 33:07.152
I have your email,
your IP address,

33:07.236 --> 33:08.946
your work product.

33:08.946 --> 33:12.658
You are in this now.

33:16.245 --> 33:18.872
I know what you're thinking.

33:18.956 --> 33:20.416
You want to run,

33:20.416 --> 33:23.585
just like all the horses in here
want to run.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.671
Go tell the cops.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.297
Have your wife wire you money.

33:27.381 --> 33:29.800
Find a private plane out of here
and back to the U.S.

33:29.800 --> 33:32.136
where everything's safe.

33:32.136 --> 33:33.595
Let me tell you something.

33:33.679 --> 33:36.598
No place is safe.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.267
You tell anyone,

33:38.267 --> 33:39.810
you're looking at
30 years minimum

33:39.810 --> 33:41.145
for what you did today.

33:41.145 --> 33:45.065
I-I can't...

33:45.149 --> 33:47.985
- I can't do this.
- Can't do what?

33:47.985 --> 33:50.362
Can't get rich
beyond your wildest dreams

33:50.446 --> 33:51.905
for just banging away
on your laptop?

33:51.989 --> 33:53.782
Well, here's the deal.

33:53.866 --> 33:55.617
I'm gonna do you a favor.

33:55.701 --> 33:59.496
I'm going to protect you
from yourself.

33:59.580 --> 34:02.291
I'm gonna leave you in here
for a while,

34:02.291 --> 34:04.793
so that you don't run off
and do anything stupid.

34:04.877 --> 34:09.089
And when that fear is out of your system,

34:09.173 --> 34:11.633
I think you're gonna find

34:11.717 --> 34:16.263
that not only can you do it,
you'll want to do it.

34:17.681 --> 34:21.268
In the meantime, Paul...

34:22.478 --> 34:24.563
...don't gnaw at the gate.

35:25.624 --> 35:27.668
- Wh-What's going on?!
- Come here.

35:33.423 --> 35:36.802
Please, please.
Please help me.

35:38.846 --> 35:41.056
No. No.

35:42.224 --> 35:43.809
He wouldn't listen
to Mr. Kliner.

35:43.809 --> 35:46.895
This, this is what happens
to you and your family

35:46.979 --> 35:49.314
if you don't do
what you are told.

35:49.398 --> 35:51.024
No, no, no!

35:51.108 --> 35:53.610
- No, no.
- No!

35:55.904 --> 35:57.781
You see a man...

35:59.116 --> 36:02.494
...crucified and castrated
in front of you,

36:02.578 --> 36:04.997
you do what you're told.

36:06.164 --> 36:09.501
Paul did what he was told,
and they killed him anyway.

36:12.254 --> 36:14.673
I can't let them be next.

36:14.673 --> 36:17.467
I will not let that happen.

36:19.553 --> 36:21.638
Let's go.

36:21.722 --> 36:23.056
Okay, come on.

36:23.140 --> 36:24.683
Come on, girls.

36:29.062 --> 36:31.106
- What the hell happened?
- They found us.

36:31.106 --> 36:32.190
- How?
- No idea.

36:32.274 --> 36:33.358
I took care of it.

36:33.442 --> 36:35.569
Okay. Well, we can't take
any more chances.

36:35.569 --> 36:37.404
I'll be with you until we can
figure out what to do next.

36:37.404 --> 36:38.947
Okay.

36:42.868 --> 36:44.703
<i></i>

37:18.612 --> 37:20.155
Yes, sir.

37:20.781 --> 37:21.907
Up ahead on the left.

37:21.907 --> 37:23.533
Okay.

37:33.543 --> 37:35.921
- Can I help you?
- I need a suit.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.298
I don't know
I have enough fabric.

37:38.382 --> 37:40.258
I don't have time for jokes.
I need something now.

37:40.342 --> 37:42.511
A football player on the Giants,

37:42.511 --> 37:44.054
he never pick up a custom job.

37:45.097 --> 37:46.848
You want a pocket square?

37:48.976 --> 37:50.519
Okay.

38:09.663 --> 38:11.832
Yeah, we got a problem.

38:23.635 --> 38:25.262
The guy'll be out by tomorrow
anyway.

38:26.471 --> 38:27.472
I know.

38:28.098 --> 38:29.224
August 26...

38:37.482 --> 38:38.859
May I help you, sir?

38:38.859 --> 38:41.194
I'm here to see my client,
Stephanie Castillo.

38:41.278 --> 38:43.238
I believe she's
under your protection.

38:43.238 --> 38:44.823
Yeah, what exactly is going on
with her?

38:44.823 --> 38:46.408
She just insisted
we take her here in,

38:46.408 --> 38:49.161
something about a murder,
how she's in danger.

38:49.161 --> 38:50.412
Now she won't say anything
to us.

38:50.412 --> 38:52.998
I promise, Sergeant Diaz,

38:52.998 --> 38:55.542
I'll fill you in
after she and I speak.

38:55.542 --> 38:56.710
You have my word.

38:58.628 --> 39:00.547
All right. Follow me.

39:02.466 --> 39:03.592
Right this way.

39:09.681 --> 39:11.016
Wow, there really was something

39:11.016 --> 39:12.934
in the water
at that Reacher house, huh?

39:14.895 --> 39:17.022
My condolences for the death
of your Princeton colleague.

39:17.022 --> 39:18.398
Thank you.

39:18.482 --> 39:20.776
My condolences
for the death of your brother.

39:22.569 --> 39:26.156
How did you and Joe know
each other?

39:26.156 --> 39:28.116
Um...

39:28.200 --> 39:31.244
We collaborated over the last
few years.

39:31.328 --> 39:32.537
He was brilliant,

39:32.621 --> 39:34.623
and he also knew
what he didn't know,

39:34.623 --> 39:36.500
which made him even smarter.

39:37.542 --> 39:41.546
His job would require
my expertise from time to time.

39:41.630 --> 39:44.841
- International and domestic monetary policy.
- Yeah.

39:44.925 --> 39:48.011
But Joe contacted me
and Professor Bryant

39:48.095 --> 39:50.555
for a specialty
that we don't advertise.

39:51.932 --> 39:54.810
We were the only two academics
in the U.S. specializing

39:54.810 --> 39:57.020
in the theoretical effects
of MUC--

39:57.104 --> 39:59.481
Mass Undetectable
Counterfeiting--

39:59.481 --> 40:01.149
on a global economic scale.

40:01.233 --> 40:03.527
Is that a big problem
these days?

40:03.527 --> 40:05.153
Yeah, it's bigger
than you might think.

40:05.237 --> 40:08.406
Do you know that 80%
of existing U.S. currency

40:08.490 --> 40:10.659
is in hundred-dollar bills?

40:10.659 --> 40:12.327
I mean,
I-I don't know about you,

40:12.327 --> 40:14.162
but 80% of the money
that I see every day,

40:14.246 --> 40:15.622
it's not C-notes.

40:15.622 --> 40:17.624
So, where's all that cash?

40:17.624 --> 40:18.959
Abroad.

40:18.959 --> 40:20.627
Underground economies.

40:20.627 --> 40:22.921
Drugs. Arms.
Human trafficking.

40:22.921 --> 40:25.590
Not exactly
credit card friendly,

40:25.674 --> 40:28.051
but they all have
a denomination of choice.

40:28.135 --> 40:30.637
The American hundred-dollar
bill.

40:31.638 --> 40:33.598
We have the most stable currency
on the planet.

40:33.682 --> 40:36.268
It acts as a reserve
against all others.

40:36.268 --> 40:38.562
Nobody's in the market
for a fake Ugandan shilling.

40:38.562 --> 40:41.731
The U.S. hundred is the Holy
Grail of counterfeiters.

40:41.815 --> 40:45.735
Now, if a fake is good enough,
it's called a superbill.

40:45.819 --> 40:47.696
North Korean government has
an entire department

40:47.696 --> 40:49.072
devoted to creating one.

40:49.156 --> 40:50.782
But if it's that stable,

40:50.866 --> 40:52.659
it must be difficult
to replicate.

40:53.952 --> 40:56.538
Yeah, well,
there are security features.

40:56.538 --> 41:00.792
Strips, holograms,
specific dyes.

41:00.876 --> 41:04.754
But all of that, if someone is
determined and talented enough,

41:04.838 --> 41:07.382
all of it can be replicated.

41:07.382 --> 41:08.967
The key is the paper.

41:10.010 --> 41:13.889
Now, Joe, he made it impossible
to get that paper.

41:13.889 --> 41:16.641
Made it so that only
one company in the U.S.

41:16.725 --> 41:18.852
has statutory authority
to manufacture paper

41:18.852 --> 41:20.896
for the U.S. Mint,

41:20.896 --> 41:23.607
and that location is locked down
tighter than Fort Knox.

41:23.607 --> 41:25.192
However,

41:25.192 --> 41:26.902
Joe discovered superbills were

41:26.902 --> 41:28.820
being manufactured
somehow anyway.

41:28.904 --> 41:31.323
He thought it was taking place
somewhere in Georgia.

41:33.575 --> 41:35.619
Made in Georgia?

41:35.619 --> 41:37.871
Like Coca-Cola and peanuts.

41:41.625 --> 41:43.793
What is it?

41:43.877 --> 41:46.129
My partners and I...

41:46.213 --> 41:48.757
we had the system backwards.

41:48.757 --> 41:50.300
They're not making money
in Venezuela

41:50.300 --> 41:51.843
and shipping out to the U.S.

41:51.927 --> 41:55.263
They're making money in the U.S.
and shipping out to Venezuela.

41:57.349 --> 41:58.558
I have to go.

41:59.601 --> 42:01.478
I didn't realize
it was Venezuela.

42:01.478 --> 42:03.730
You find out where they're
getting the paper to do it,

42:03.730 --> 42:05.899
and you will stop
whatever Joe was trying to stop.

42:05.899 --> 42:07.817
You know you'll have to stay
in police custody

42:07.901 --> 42:09.402
until all of this is dealt with.

42:09.486 --> 42:10.987
It's for your safety.

42:11.071 --> 42:13.073
I understand.

42:13.073 --> 42:16.034
How are you gonna take down
whoever's doing this?

42:19.746 --> 42:21.206
Painfully.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.211
What branch of the military
were you in?

42:28.755 --> 42:30.423
Your shoes are tied
with a ladder lace.

42:30.507 --> 42:31.716
Pants, military hem.

42:31.800 --> 42:33.218
Cuff sleeves extended
exactly to the center

42:33.218 --> 42:34.219
of your wrist bone.

42:34.219 --> 42:36.972
Army. First Lieutenant.

42:36.972 --> 42:38.139
Major Jack Reacher.

42:38.223 --> 42:40.308
110th Special Investigations,
retired.

42:40.392 --> 42:42.894
- Nice to meet you, sir.
- I need your help, Lieutenant.

42:44.604 --> 42:45.939
I'm not a lawyer.

42:45.939 --> 42:47.732
I'm just trying to do
the right thing.

42:47.816 --> 42:49.025
Two federal agents,
multiple cops,

42:49.109 --> 42:50.694
and several civilians are dead.

42:50.694 --> 42:53.071
I'm working the case privately
with a police force down south.

42:53.071 --> 42:54.614
My brother, Joe Reacher,

42:54.698 --> 42:56.574
worked in the Secret Service.
You can look him up.

42:56.658 --> 42:58.493
You can look me up, too,
check my record.

42:58.493 --> 43:00.704
You'll see I'm not one to waste
time or make up stories.

43:00.704 --> 43:03.290
That woman in there
is in danger.

43:05.542 --> 43:07.210
I need you to make sure
she's protected

43:07.294 --> 43:09.713
until you get a phone call
from me and only me.

43:09.713 --> 43:12.340
It needs to be off the books,
it needs to be quiet.

43:12.424 --> 43:14.467
I can count on you, Diaz?

43:15.885 --> 43:17.178
Sir, yes, sir.

43:52.464 --> 43:54.507
- Oh.
- Whoa.
