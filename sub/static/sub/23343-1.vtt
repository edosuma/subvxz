00:21.789 --> 00:26.527
**

00:34.702 --> 00:36.337
Just close your eyes
and breathe deeply.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.772
You can do this.

00:38.806 --> 00:41.175
It's only driving a car,
it's only driving a --

00:41.209 --> 00:42.910
Watch out!

00:42.943 --> 00:44.245
I'm the one
who needs help here.

00:44.278 --> 00:46.013
You said you read
the baby books this time.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.781
I did read them.
But there was nothing about

00:47.815 --> 00:50.017
handling this level of stress
in "The Ugly Duckling."

00:50.050 --> 00:53.354
Not the books for babies,
the book about babies!

00:53.387 --> 00:55.356
Stop screaming at me.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.857
All you have to do right now
is not have a baby.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.226
You do that every day.

00:58.259 --> 00:59.960
I'm just asking
for a little sympathy here.

00:59.993 --> 01:02.062
How about
some sympathy pains?

01:04.398 --> 01:06.767
There you go.
Make yourself comfortable.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.570
I, for one, cannot wait
to meet our new little sister.

01:09.603 --> 01:10.871
I know, right?

01:10.904 --> 01:13.207
It'll really improve our game
of Knights and Princesses.

01:21.249 --> 01:23.417
And having a sister
will make us better listeners.

01:23.451 --> 01:26.654
Exactly. And having a sister
will make us better listeners.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.590
Plus we'll look cool when
we protect her from bullies.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.894
Why, you little!

01:33.927 --> 01:35.496
Okay, maybe not.

01:35.529 --> 01:37.331
But at least she'll hook us up
with her friends

01:37.365 --> 01:39.567
when the time comes
for us to get married.

01:41.769 --> 01:44.738
I don't know, man. They'll
always be a lot younger than us.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.240
But if we take
good care of them,

01:46.274 --> 01:48.242
they can return the favor
when we're old.

01:50.144 --> 01:51.512
Oh, yeah.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.581
Well, either way,
I can't wait to meet her.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.116
-She's coming!
-I mean, I could wait a little.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.451
Hold on, honey.
We're almost there.

01:57.485 --> 01:59.320
-I just have to park.
-No time!

01:59.353 --> 02:00.821
Okay.
We'll use the drive-thru.

02:00.854 --> 02:03.291
There isn't a drive-thru
at the hospital!

02:03.324 --> 02:04.992
Doctor: Push.

02:05.025 --> 02:07.628
Congratulations.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.363
There is now.

02:10.298 --> 02:13.267
Boys, say hello
to your little sister.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.937
Anais. Anais.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.506
Aww, look at her.

02:18.539 --> 02:21.442
She's so sweet,
she's given me cavities.

02:21.475 --> 02:25.446
Um, dude, I -- I think
you had a little accident.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.715
It's just
my heart melting.

02:36.590 --> 02:40.294
Man: And here we witness
the delicate first seconds

02:40.328 --> 02:42.129
in the life
of a great bald eagle.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.198
But who would expect
such a sweet chick to also be

02:44.232 --> 02:48.469
a natural born killer?

02:48.502 --> 02:49.970
If sharing is caring,

02:50.003 --> 02:53.474
then this is the eagle
that just don't care.

02:55.576 --> 02:58.145
There's no way Anais
would have pushed us

02:58.178 --> 02:59.580
out of the car
on purpose.

02:59.613 --> 03:00.814
You know why?

03:00.848 --> 03:03.083
Because all babies
are born innocent.

03:03.116 --> 03:05.553
And if you thought
all babies were born innocent,

03:05.586 --> 03:08.422
check out these baby sharks
eating each other

03:08.456 --> 03:10.591
before they're even born.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.862
Wait. Maybe she did it
because she was scared?

03:14.895 --> 03:17.865
So what do people do
when someone's scared?

03:17.898 --> 03:19.333
Hmm.

03:19.367 --> 03:22.202
Pull yourself together!
You're being hysterical!

03:22.236 --> 03:25.606
Okay, I meant what do
morally well-balanced people
do when they're scared?

03:25.639 --> 03:27.841
We show her
how much we love her.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.210
I love you
and value your companionship!

03:30.244 --> 03:33.547
Dude!

03:33.581 --> 03:37.351
That's better.
See? Happy baby.

03:37.385 --> 03:40.187
Hey, Anais.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.755
What's that
you're drawing?

03:41.789 --> 03:44.024
Oh. Very good.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.294
Is that Mommy?
-Mm.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.195
-Mm.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.563
And where are we?

03:50.564 --> 03:52.866
Oh, we're the flowers?

03:52.900 --> 03:54.635
Mnh-mnh.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.637
Oh. Right.

03:56.670 --> 03:59.039
Er, let's play a game.
You want to play a game?

04:01.442 --> 04:04.044
Okay, this one is called
hide and seek.

04:04.077 --> 04:07.114
We close our eyes and count,
and you hide.

04:07.147 --> 04:08.549
Ready?
-Mm.

04:08.582 --> 04:11.985
Both:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.754
Ready or not, here we come.

04:19.593 --> 04:23.063
Hey!
Where are you going?

04:23.096 --> 04:24.598
That was terrifying.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.934
Yeah, well, at least your soul
was going upwards.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.842
Gumball: All right,
I've had enough of you.

04:34.875 --> 04:37.978
You're going right back
to where you came from.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.082
Hey, what's that?

04:42.115 --> 04:43.484
"No one loves you.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.353
Signed, Gumball and Darwin."

04:45.386 --> 04:47.621
I would never write
something like that.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.493
"No won luvs u."

04:52.526 --> 04:53.594
Well, yeah,
that's more like it.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.796
What is going on here?

04:55.829 --> 04:57.965
Mnh-mnh.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.467
Mnh-mnh.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.703
Mm-hmm

05:07.240 --> 05:08.609
It's a trap! It's a trap!

05:12.179 --> 05:13.614
Gumball:
Listen, I'm not jealous.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.816
It's just, you know how
adopting Darwin

05:15.849 --> 05:17.618
really brightened
everyone's lives?

05:17.651 --> 05:19.953
Well, don't you think it's time
we gave that gift of happiness

05:19.987 --> 05:21.054
to another family?

05:21.088 --> 05:23.123
And by "that gift of happiness,"
I mean Anais.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.959
And by "another family," I mean
a pack of scavenging hyenas.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.496
Look, I understand.

05:28.529 --> 05:29.963
You're no longer
the babies of the house,

05:29.997 --> 05:31.632
and that's
a big adjustment.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.801
It was difficult
for your father, as well.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.903
But just because there's
a new baby in the house,

05:35.936 --> 05:37.805
doesn't mean
I'll love you any less.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.707
So you mean
love multiplies?

05:39.740 --> 05:41.809
No, it divides.
But I'll take the difference

05:41.842 --> 05:44.645
from your dad's portion and
hope our marriage survives
until you go to college.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.246
Mm

05:46.279 --> 05:47.848
Now let's hug.

06:03.296 --> 06:04.665
Darwin:
Maybe Mrs. Mom is right.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.435
Anais isn't the problem.
We are.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.503
Come on,
let's play with her.

06:09.537 --> 06:11.104
Peek-a-boo. Peek-a-boo.

06:11.138 --> 06:14.174
Hmm. Let's try it
with funnier faces.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.876
Peek-a-boo. Peek-a-boo.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.411
Ah, come on.

06:17.445 --> 06:19.813
Peek-a... Peek-a...

06:22.916 --> 06:24.518
...boom.

06:24.552 --> 06:29.857
**

06:35.796 --> 06:37.465
Huh?

06:37.498 --> 06:38.866
Mm.

06:38.899 --> 06:45.205
**

06:52.846 --> 06:55.549
I'm gonna go for a drive.

06:55.583 --> 06:58.652
Darwin, no!

07:04.124 --> 07:05.493
Hmm

07:07.795 --> 07:10.063
What has she done
to our cereal?

07:10.097 --> 07:11.064
Mm, it looks okay.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.466
Why's she doing
the face, then?

07:12.500 --> 07:14.167
There's enough sugar in here

07:14.201 --> 07:16.570
to clog your arteries
in a couple of spoonfuls.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.340
I can't take this
anymore.

07:20.373 --> 07:22.242
I'm getting
anxiety attacks.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.445
Oh, thank you.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.252
Get away.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.255
-There, there.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.691
You know what they say.
What doesn't kill you --

07:37.725 --> 07:40.360
Will try again later.
We have to counter-attack.

07:40.393 --> 07:43.030
But how?
She smarter than us.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.698
Huh?

07:47.000 --> 07:50.270
Yeah, she might be terrifyingly
intelligent for her age,

07:50.303 --> 07:53.040
but she's still her age.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.614
Ha! You fool!

08:00.648 --> 08:02.883
You fell into our trap.
You lose.

08:02.916 --> 08:05.118
Hear our superior laughter.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.189
And now we're gonna send you
as unlabelled meat

08:09.222 --> 08:10.524
to the dog-food factory.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.628
So no one's actually coming
to collect her?

08:14.662 --> 08:16.296
'Course not. We're just gonna
leave her outside

08:16.329 --> 08:19.132
until she's stewed long enough
for her cold, dark heart

08:19.166 --> 08:20.300
to melt a little.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.536
-Oh, my gosh, that's horrible.
-It's fine.

08:22.570 --> 08:25.505
We're only giving
her a little scare to
assert our authority.

08:25.539 --> 08:27.775
No, I meant
that's horrible.

08:33.547 --> 08:34.715
Gumball!

08:34.748 --> 08:36.383
Oh, yeah, sorry.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.351
It's your turn
to pass out now.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.893
Anais?!
Where are you?!

08:45.926 --> 08:47.227
There. Look.

08:52.700 --> 08:55.335
No.
We have to save her.

09:06.213 --> 09:09.216
Oh, ha. I guess there is
an advantage to being 2-D.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.190
No!

09:21.261 --> 09:22.763
Good work, buddy!

09:39.613 --> 09:41.281
Oh, come on.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.919
I really wish Mom
didn't raise me so well,

09:45.953 --> 09:48.088
'causes this deserves
a much stronger cuss word

09:48.121 --> 09:52.726
than fiddlesti-i-i-i-i-i-cks!

10:01.101 --> 10:06.306
**

10:08.008 --> 10:11.812
Anais,
we're so sorry.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.747
-We're so, so sorry.
-So sorry.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.615
I'm sorry.

10:15.649 --> 10:18.351
Huh?
Anais, where are you?!

10:18.385 --> 10:23.290
!
!

10:27.560 --> 10:29.262
Anais! Anais!

10:29.296 --> 10:31.699
-We thought you were gone.
-We -- we --

10:31.732 --> 10:33.934
we thought
we'd lost you.

10:36.369 --> 10:37.971
Hmm?

10:38.005 --> 10:39.707
Mm.

10:41.541 --> 10:42.843
Guh...

10:42.876 --> 10:45.512
Oh, my gosh, her first words.

10:45.545 --> 10:46.613
Gumbhh...

10:46.646 --> 10:48.782
Yes, yes, "Gumball."
It's me.

10:48.816 --> 10:50.450
She's trying
to say my name.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.219
Gum-gum.

10:52.252 --> 10:53.687
Yes

10:53.721 --> 10:55.789
Gumball did it.

11:02.562 --> 11:12.305
**

11:12.339 --> 11:22.082
**

11:22.115 --> 11:31.925
**
