00:06.327 --> 00:07.213
Hey.

00:07.233 --> 00:09.679
How was your day?

00:10.733 --> 00:11.898
What's her problem?

00:11.950 --> 00:13.433
Friend drama.

00:13.588 --> 00:14.651
Again?

00:15.043 --> 00:16.737
Come on. Cheer up.

00:16.805 --> 00:18.161
You and Harper
will work things out.

00:18.181 --> 00:19.930
I don't want to work things out.

00:19.950 --> 00:21.742
Well, that's okay, too.

00:21.827 --> 00:23.577
You know? Friends come and go.

00:23.629 --> 00:24.878
Yeah, you'll have lots
of friends in your life.

00:24.913 --> 00:26.830
You'll have school friends
and sports friends.

00:26.915 --> 00:28.915
Mm-hmm. College friends.

00:29.001 --> 00:30.584
And imaginary friends.

00:31.509 --> 00:32.668
Then you'll grow up,

00:32.755 --> 00:34.921
get married, have kids
and have no friends.

00:34.973 --> 00:37.310
Well, you'll have one friend.

00:37.775 --> 00:39.202
Who?

00:41.930 --> 00:42.929
Mommy's right.

00:43.015 --> 00:44.664
No friends.

00:51.880 --> 00:53.824
So what are we celebrating?

00:53.909 --> 00:54.858
Ooh, something really big.

00:54.943 --> 00:57.027
Go ahead, tell them.

00:57.112 --> 00:58.779
You guys aren't getting...?

00:58.831 --> 01:00.781
Oh, no, it's not that big.

01:00.866 --> 01:02.749
I'm writing a children's book.

01:02.785 --> 01:03.867
About...

01:03.952 --> 01:05.585
Addiction.

01:05.621 --> 01:07.671
Uh, write what you know,
I guess. Right?

01:07.756 --> 01:09.039
Exactly.

01:09.124 --> 01:11.875
It's called Farmer Todd
Has a Problem.

01:11.960 --> 01:15.545
Helping Children Understand
the Disease of Addiction.

01:15.631 --> 01:16.880
Oh.

01:16.965 --> 01:19.683
So you're writing a book
to justify your implosion?

01:19.768 --> 01:23.527
I wouldn't put it that way,
but... yes.

01:23.547 --> 01:25.854
Well, congratulations.

01:26.257 --> 01:28.181
Cheers.

01:29.812 --> 01:31.978
So how's it going with you guys?

01:32.030 --> 01:33.814
Oh, AJ and I are just
hanging out.

01:33.866 --> 01:35.782
I can't get into
anything serious right now.

01:35.818 --> 01:37.784
Because of your ex?

01:37.820 --> 01:39.703
Oh...

01:39.788 --> 01:41.822
Ugh, he really did a
number on you, huh?

01:41.907 --> 01:44.908
Well, you know,
at least we're good exes.

01:44.993 --> 01:46.793
Good exes pay child support.

01:48.747 --> 01:50.997
Sorry.

01:51.049 --> 01:52.799
- Did I overstep?
- It's fine.

01:52.835 --> 01:55.912
He's actually squaring up.
He just closed a big deal.

01:56.889 --> 01:58.638
Really?

01:58.674 --> 01:59.973
Yeah, so, uh,
no more apartments.

02:00.008 --> 02:01.808
I'm looking at houses.

02:01.844 --> 02:03.927
There's actually one in Van Nuys
that I'm crazy about.

02:04.012 --> 02:07.514
Do you want me to come
look at it with you?

02:07.599 --> 02:09.602
So you can tell me what to do?

02:09.622 --> 02:11.499
Do I do that?

02:13.050 --> 02:15.522
I guess I do that.

02:15.607 --> 02:16.690
Mmm.

02:16.775 --> 02:18.658
Hey, uh, would
you ever consider

02:18.694 --> 02:19.993
coming to my weekly meeting?

02:20.028 --> 02:21.695
Um... A.A.?

02:21.747 --> 02:22.913
I always tell stories

02:22.998 --> 02:24.948
about what a great friend
you've been,

02:25.033 --> 02:28.702
and everyone's always like,
"Oh, I wish I had a Russ."

02:28.754 --> 02:30.620
Oh...

02:30.706 --> 02:31.872
Thanks, man. That's awesome.

02:31.957 --> 02:33.790
You're awesome.

02:34.399 --> 02:35.842
Yeah. I mean, I would...

02:35.878 --> 02:38.678
I would totally, you know,
love to check it out.

02:38.714 --> 02:41.548
It's just, uh, I'm so busy
with work, you know?

02:41.568 --> 02:43.800
Yeah, well, if you don't
have time, you don't have time.

02:43.886 --> 02:46.553
But if you do...

02:48.056 --> 02:50.557
it would be really great
to, you know...

02:53.812 --> 02:55.812
Well, here we are.

02:55.898 --> 02:57.697
This is it. Huh?

02:57.733 --> 02:59.616
- I'll see you in a sec.
- Okay.

02:59.701 --> 03:01.785
I'm so happy you're here.

03:01.870 --> 03:02.953
Hey. Oh, hey.

03:04.362 --> 03:05.739
Hey, is this your first meeting?

03:05.791 --> 03:06.873
- Yeah.
- Huh.

03:06.909 --> 03:07.991
You?

03:08.076 --> 03:09.793
Oh, I've been... 18, 19 times.

03:09.878 --> 03:11.578
Really?

03:11.630 --> 03:12.913
Yeah, I started coming out
to support AJ,

03:12.998 --> 03:14.798
but, uh, now I'm hooked
on the stories.

03:14.883 --> 03:17.634
Cindy loves to get
all the juicy details.

03:17.719 --> 03:20.754
Our new fetish? Rock bottom.

03:23.892 --> 03:25.976
That was real nice, Kyle.

03:26.061 --> 03:28.072
Anybody else want to share?

03:34.648 --> 03:36.987
Hi. I'm AJ,
and I'm an alcoholic.

03:37.072 --> 03:39.006
Hi, AJ.

03:39.391 --> 03:42.903
Couple years ago my marriage
started to fall apart.

03:44.132 --> 03:46.291
I hurt a lot of people.

03:46.697 --> 03:50.172
Friends, family...
my daughter.

03:50.743 --> 03:51.868
How many of you
know what it's like

03:51.954 --> 03:53.870
to break a child's heart?

03:54.230 --> 03:56.082
I know, I know.

03:56.102 --> 03:59.676
And how many of you wish
there was a children's book

03:59.761 --> 04:03.527
that could help all that pain
just go away?

04:05.575 --> 04:06.800
Well, uh...

04:06.852 --> 04:07.934
What was your name, sir?

04:08.422 --> 04:10.197
Uh, Myron.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.368
Well, Myron,

04:12.678 --> 04:14.458
help is on the way.

04:14.478 --> 04:16.766
Farmer Todd, his
farm is thriving,

04:16.786 --> 04:18.094
but he's out of control.

04:18.113 --> 04:20.362
He's drinking too much milk,
he's smoking hay,

04:20.382 --> 04:21.688
he's snorting cornmeal...

04:21.708 --> 04:22.817
Rock bottom?

04:22.837 --> 04:26.652
Until, one day,
the pigs, the cows, the geese,

04:26.672 --> 04:29.055
they surprise Farmer Todd
in his barn

04:29.140 --> 04:30.809
and they force him
to face his truth.

04:30.829 --> 04:32.050
That shit is real.

04:32.070 --> 04:33.589
- But it's also cute.
- Ah.

04:33.609 --> 04:35.644
Real... cute. That's our brand.

04:35.664 --> 04:37.998
My nephews could've used
a book like that when I got back

04:38.050 --> 04:39.666
from the Philippines.

04:39.751 --> 04:41.635
Lincoln was a merchant marine.

04:41.670 --> 04:43.003
You're always a merchant marine.

04:43.962 --> 04:44.971
More importantly than that,

04:45.007 --> 04:47.674
he is six years sober
and he has helped me a lot.

04:47.759 --> 04:49.976
Hope you guys
are proud of your friend.

04:50.012 --> 04:52.929
Oh, they are. That's why they're
helping me with the book.

04:53.015 --> 04:53.998
Huh?

04:54.018 --> 04:56.016
God has got a big smile

04:56.068 --> 04:57.901
on his face right now.
Good luck, fellas.

04:57.986 --> 04:59.653
Thanks, Lincoln.

04:59.688 --> 05:00.737
Thank you, sir.

05:02.709 --> 05:03.523
Wait.

05:03.575 --> 05:04.691
We're helping you with the book?

05:04.776 --> 05:05.942
Yeah.

05:06.028 --> 05:07.861
I'm writing it,
Bernie's printing it,

05:07.946 --> 05:09.579
you're my illustrator.

05:09.665 --> 05:11.998
Uh, it's just...
this is not a good time

05:12.034 --> 05:14.701
for me to be taking on... more.

05:14.753 --> 05:16.585
I thought that you believed
in the idea.

05:16.771 --> 05:17.620
I-I do.

05:17.706 --> 05:18.872
Were you just blowing smoke
up my ass?

05:18.924 --> 05:20.590
No. I... I do.

05:20.676 --> 05:23.710
I... Yeah, I really
like the idea.

05:23.762 --> 05:24.878
How cool is this?

05:24.930 --> 05:26.963
That we're doing
a book together, huh?

05:27.049 --> 05:29.716
I'm gonna get some more cookies.

05:30.016 --> 05:31.551
Super cool.

05:31.636 --> 05:33.803
Oh, why the hell
did I agree to this?

05:33.889 --> 05:35.555
Hey, do chickens fly?

05:35.607 --> 05:36.890
- I think they fly.
- I don't know.

05:36.942 --> 05:38.558
Ask one of your daughters.

05:41.052 --> 05:41.895
AJ again?

05:41.947 --> 05:45.732
Yeah. He's texted like 20 times
in the last 15 minutes.

05:45.817 --> 05:46.900
About the book?

05:46.952 --> 05:48.568
He's obsessed.

05:48.620 --> 05:49.819
For now.

05:50.555 --> 05:52.572
And then, in three weeks,

05:52.624 --> 05:54.040
he will be obsessed
with something else.

05:54.409 --> 05:56.581
You should tell him that...

05:58.393 --> 05:59.671
Never mind.

06:00.155 --> 06:02.170
- What jus happend?
- Nothing.

06:02.190 --> 06:03.883
You were about to tell me what to do

06:03.919 --> 06:06.327
- and then you just stopped.
- Yeah.

06:06.513 --> 06:07.804
I'm working on that.

06:07.889 --> 06:08.922
Why?

06:09.007 --> 06:10.590
I hear that some people

06:10.642 --> 06:11.758
might not like it.

06:11.810 --> 06:13.593
What?

06:13.645 --> 06:15.562
But you're so good at it.

06:15.597 --> 06:17.250
I know.

06:21.387 --> 06:23.001
I sent you some links

06:23.021 --> 06:24.536
for inspiration last night.

06:24.556 --> 06:26.640
- Did you get the links?
- Yeah, I did.

06:26.692 --> 06:27.774
I-I guess I just thought...

06:27.810 --> 06:28.859
Did he look at the links?

06:28.944 --> 06:29.860
Uh...

06:29.945 --> 06:30.727
I looked at the links.

06:30.747 --> 06:31.832
Did you look at the links

06:31.852 --> 06:33.370
- that I sent you?
- Yes.

06:33.390 --> 06:36.483
I looked at the links. I just...

06:37.765 --> 06:39.564
Um... excuse me one second.

06:39.584 --> 06:41.822
Sorry. Excuse me.

06:44.477 --> 06:45.909
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

06:45.929 --> 06:47.261
You remember Lincoln.

06:47.313 --> 06:48.788
Yeah.

06:48.808 --> 06:50.562
We were just, uh,
checking to see

06:50.582 --> 06:53.193
how things were coming
with Farmer Todd.

06:53.213 --> 06:55.185
I haven't really had a chance,

06:55.271 --> 06:56.863
'cause I've been working.

06:56.883 --> 06:59.156
Here. At my office.

06:59.242 --> 07:00.991
Dude, we got to get
moving on this

07:01.077 --> 07:03.077
before somebody else comes out
with a competing project.

07:03.129 --> 07:04.912
It's only a matter of time.

07:04.997 --> 07:06.914
It's in the ether.

07:06.966 --> 07:09.083
Yeah... Can we get back to it?

07:09.168 --> 07:10.751
Yes. Absolutely.

07:10.837 --> 07:12.253
Um, guys, we're kind of

07:12.305 --> 07:15.065
- in the middle of something.
- Well, this won't take long.

07:16.008 --> 07:18.893
AJ, this is Gil, my boss.

07:18.928 --> 07:21.812
Who really needs
to talk to me right now.

07:21.832 --> 07:22.847
He's your boss?

07:22.932 --> 07:23.931
Yes.

07:23.983 --> 07:25.370
He is.

07:29.941 --> 07:30.821
Are you sure?

07:30.907 --> 07:32.498
Positive.

07:32.944 --> 07:34.476
Whiz kid. I like it.

07:34.496 --> 07:36.630
When you're done socializing.

07:37.412 --> 07:39.392
Goddamn millennial.

07:47.570 --> 07:49.568
I think the guys gonna love this place.

07:49.588 --> 07:52.108
- Guys?
- Oh yeah, my ex is gonna come

07:52.128 --> 07:53.844
check it out just give it the once-over.

07:53.930 --> 07:55.160
Oh.

07:55.867 --> 07:57.014
What?

07:57.100 --> 07:59.049
Did you look at his place
before he moved in?

07:59.135 --> 08:00.184
Lina...

08:00.806 --> 08:01.802
I'll shut up.

08:03.239 --> 08:03.971
Hey, sweetie.

08:04.056 --> 08:05.511
- Hi.
- How are you?

08:05.531 --> 08:06.974
- I'm good.
- You smell so good.

08:07.026 --> 08:08.275
Oh. Thanks.

08:08.311 --> 08:10.027
You must be the beautiful
and brilliant Lina.

08:10.113 --> 08:11.028
Wow.

08:11.114 --> 08:12.980
Hi. Jacob.

08:13.032 --> 08:14.982
Well, I came all the way
over the hill

08:15.034 --> 08:16.784
at rush hour, so...

08:16.819 --> 08:18.035
Here it is.

08:18.121 --> 08:19.120
All right.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.826
Page seven,

08:25.912 --> 08:27.161
tractor's turned over.

08:27.246 --> 08:29.246
Farmer Todd's passed out.

08:29.332 --> 08:32.249
Empty milk cartons everywhere.

08:32.335 --> 08:35.001
- The little lamb sobs.
- Yeah, this is all good.

08:35.087 --> 08:36.220
But if we're going
to work on this together,

08:36.304 --> 08:37.837
it's gotta be on my schedule.

08:37.890 --> 08:38.972
I know you're in the shit.

08:39.008 --> 08:40.404
That's why I brought Lincoln.

08:40.826 --> 08:42.549
I don't... What?

08:43.158 --> 08:45.846
- You said you were looking for an intern.
- Yeah.

08:45.898 --> 08:47.932
Looking for an intern
with a design background.

08:48.017 --> 08:49.233
Which Lincoln has.

08:49.318 --> 08:51.018
I thought you said
he was a merchant marine.

08:51.103 --> 08:54.046
When there are no women around,
you draw them.

08:55.262 --> 08:56.991
Okay. You need to go.

08:57.026 --> 08:58.075
What about Farmer Todd?

08:58.661 --> 08:59.480
I don't know.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.205
I can't deal with this
right now. I'm working.

09:01.225 --> 09:03.389
True or false?
You are always talking

09:03.409 --> 09:05.783
about how unsatisfying
your job is.

09:05.868 --> 09:07.117
Can you not yell that?

09:07.203 --> 09:08.836
True or false?

09:08.871 --> 09:11.038
You are ready
to reinvent yourself

09:11.090 --> 09:12.873
as a children's book
illustrator.

09:12.959 --> 09:14.925
I don't know. Maybe.

09:15.011 --> 09:16.043
In theory, I guess.

09:16.128 --> 09:17.178
Farmer Todd is not a theory.

09:17.213 --> 09:18.879
He is as real as you or me.

09:18.931 --> 09:20.047
Is he?

09:20.132 --> 09:21.882
- What does that mean?
- You've just...

09:21.968 --> 09:24.281
you've started
a lot of projects lately.

09:28.289 --> 09:30.251
I knew it.

09:30.977 --> 09:32.860
It's fine.

09:33.254 --> 09:35.229
Well, my ex-wife
stopped believing in me.

09:35.314 --> 09:37.198
- My ex-partner stopped believing in me.
- Oh, my God.

09:37.233 --> 09:39.233
I'm used to it.
You know, Lincoln says

09:39.318 --> 09:41.035
that I should let go of all

09:41.070 --> 09:42.203
the negative influences
in my life.

09:42.238 --> 09:43.871
Maybe he was talking about you.

09:44.649 --> 09:45.766
Maybe he was.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.875
- I wasn't.
- Yeah, you were.

09:47.910 --> 09:48.959
You just didn't know it yet.

09:49.045 --> 09:50.244
You need to get out of here.

09:50.296 --> 09:52.796
- Oh, I can take a hint.
- Not a hint.

09:52.882 --> 09:54.081
About that internship...

09:54.166 --> 09:56.050
I'm proficient in Word Perfect.

09:56.085 --> 10:00.054
Um... sorry I can't

10:00.089 --> 10:01.972
fix your toaster.

10:08.124 --> 10:10.519
The toaster was never broken.

10:11.100 --> 10:13.402
There's a little nook
off the living room.

10:13.422 --> 10:15.822
Think I'm gonna bring
my loom out of storage.

10:15.842 --> 10:17.071
- That a girl.
- Mm-hmm.

10:17.728 --> 10:19.106
And, um...

10:19.589 --> 10:20.908
it's the kitchen.

10:20.943 --> 10:23.309
- It's a little small, but...
- It's so cute.

10:23.329 --> 10:24.344
I know.

10:24.430 --> 10:25.595
Yeah, this is beautiful.

10:25.681 --> 10:27.347
I think you've outdone
yourself, Abby.

10:27.399 --> 10:29.349
Thank you.

10:29.401 --> 10:31.048
Uh-oh. Bars on the window.

10:31.209 --> 10:32.686
Probably need that in this hood.

10:32.771 --> 10:34.788
The "hood"?

10:35.441 --> 10:36.657
Look at this, right?

10:36.692 --> 10:38.064
Ooh, no bueno.

10:38.084 --> 10:40.610
Oh, yeah, the, uh,
landlord has a mold guy

10:40.696 --> 10:42.362
coming by next week
to check that out.

10:42.414 --> 10:45.532
Landlord's always got
a mold guy, right, Lina?

10:46.091 --> 10:47.701
That's disappointing.

10:47.753 --> 10:49.479
This looks like
it could be lead paint.

10:49.499 --> 10:51.725
Do you know a lot
about lead paint?

10:52.631 --> 10:54.257
Do you?

10:57.603 --> 10:58.345
Mmm.

10:59.216 --> 11:01.548
Do you guys want
to check out the garage?

11:01.884 --> 11:03.383
Gross.

11:03.469 --> 11:05.302
You see those weird hooks?

11:05.387 --> 11:06.553
What about them?

11:08.390 --> 11:09.556
Sex hammock?

11:10.362 --> 11:11.475
Excuse me?

11:11.560 --> 11:13.393
Was there
a sex hammock up there?

11:13.479 --> 11:15.395
Those are bicycle hooks.

11:15.751 --> 11:18.195
Oh, maybe you're right.

11:18.215 --> 11:19.821
But can we afford to be wrong?

11:19.841 --> 11:21.485
We're not wrong.

11:21.570 --> 11:23.236
That's... It's a garage.

11:23.322 --> 11:25.405
And those are
clearly bicycle hooks.

11:25.491 --> 11:27.780
Yeah, what-what exactly
are you talking about?

11:27.800 --> 11:29.790
What if this is some kind of,

11:29.810 --> 11:31.440
you know, weird pleasure zone

11:31.460 --> 11:32.696
or something?

11:32.782 --> 11:34.064
- Oh, like a dungeon.
- Yeah.

11:34.506 --> 11:35.900
- That's right, Abby.
- Like one of those...

11:35.985 --> 11:37.818
- like a...
- Abby's got a good point.

11:37.904 --> 11:40.115
Do want dungeon folk
coming by here

11:40.135 --> 11:42.039
at all hours looking
to get their rocks off?

11:42.125 --> 11:43.824
They're bicycle hooks!

11:43.876 --> 11:46.127
That's, like, a Dateline thing
we're talking about, right?

11:46.622 --> 11:47.828
Abby!

11:47.880 --> 11:49.427
Before you sign anything,

11:49.613 --> 11:51.048
why don't you and I
go get some coffee

11:51.134 --> 11:53.981
and we'll talk about
the pros and the cons?

11:54.229 --> 11:55.803
What cons?

11:56.549 --> 11:58.672
I think that this one
really works.

11:58.724 --> 12:00.724
I think we should scale down
the logo just a little bit,

12:00.810 --> 12:02.643
make it a little bit
more easy to read.

12:02.678 --> 12:03.844
I think it's really hard
to read at this point...

12:03.930 --> 12:06.315
I can't believe
I just got AJ'd again.

12:06.576 --> 12:08.597
How did that happen, you know?

12:08.617 --> 12:10.483
He ambushes me at my office,

12:10.503 --> 12:12.476
and I'm the one that's
feeling guilty about it.

12:12.496 --> 12:14.655
You guys are like an
old married couple.

12:14.690 --> 12:17.031
Well, I wouldn't... Oh.

12:18.387 --> 12:20.124
Great. Perfect.

12:20.459 --> 12:21.898
Look, Lincoln...

12:22.023 --> 12:23.623
We're not taking any more interns.

12:23.643 --> 12:25.038
I don't know what else to tell you.

12:25.058 --> 12:26.341
That's cool, man.

12:26.951 --> 12:29.669
A.J. asked me to drop this off.

12:34.161 --> 12:35.377
Okay.

12:37.437 --> 12:38.733
What is this?

12:38.753 --> 12:40.881
I don't know. It's all legalese.

12:41.620 --> 12:43.337
Oh, he's suing you.

12:43.357 --> 12:44.935
What?

12:46.249 --> 12:48.462
Wait, there's something about me

12:48.482 --> 12:50.407
relinquishing all my rights

12:50.427 --> 12:52.355
to Farmer Todd.

12:52.375 --> 12:53.644
What a drama queen.

12:53.729 --> 12:55.980
He has way too much time
on his hands.

12:56.065 --> 12:58.899
Oh, and a clause
that is the official

12:58.985 --> 13:01.551
dissolution of our friendship.

13:01.687 --> 13:03.571
Oh, my God.

13:03.591 --> 13:05.336
He's divorcing you.

13:07.000 --> 13:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:19.413 --> 13:20.754
Got the papers.

13:21.762 --> 13:22.275
And?

13:22.295 --> 13:24.385
- Ready to sign.
- Great.

13:24.405 --> 13:25.593
Should we find a notary?

13:25.613 --> 13:28.661
I am a notary... you'd know that
if you were a real friend.

13:35.102 --> 13:37.018
So, Chase's, uh,
belt test for Lions

13:37.104 --> 13:38.770
is this Sunday at 4:00.

13:38.822 --> 13:40.021
I'll be there.

13:40.107 --> 13:42.023
All right,
enough with the karate.

13:42.109 --> 13:44.025
Are we gonna
sign this lease or what?

13:44.111 --> 13:46.729
Uh, this is kind of
a family matter.

13:46.749 --> 13:49.658
Yeah, but you guys
aren't really...

13:50.713 --> 13:51.950
family.

13:52.035 --> 13:53.414
Actually, we are.

13:53.434 --> 13:55.288
Mother of my child.

13:55.308 --> 13:57.261
Lina, can you give us a minute?

13:57.281 --> 13:59.958
- But, Abby, you were...
- Please?

13:59.978 --> 14:01.626
Okay.

14:01.678 --> 14:04.033
I'll be right outside
if you need me.

14:08.852 --> 14:12.937
This right here removes me
as your emergency contact.

14:13.247 --> 14:14.686
What?

14:14.706 --> 14:17.692
Doctor's office, yoga, scuba.

14:17.888 --> 14:21.029
Okay, you were never
my emergency contact.

14:21.573 --> 14:23.064
Well, you were mine.

14:23.813 --> 14:25.332
The fact that
you can make yourself

14:25.352 --> 14:27.201
the victim here is so pathetic.

14:27.221 --> 14:29.904
I'm not making
myself the victim.

14:29.990 --> 14:33.041
I'm just saying that we both
disappointed each other.

14:33.126 --> 14:35.356
Okay, how?
How did I disappoint you?

14:35.376 --> 14:37.366
You never thanked me
for your birthday present.

14:37.386 --> 14:38.769
What birthday present?

14:38.789 --> 14:41.635
The night at Malibu Inn
that I got for you and Lina.

14:41.655 --> 14:43.051
I never thanked you

14:43.136 --> 14:45.229
because you never
actually gave it to us.

14:45.249 --> 14:47.724
I-I never actually
got it because...

14:47.744 --> 14:50.640
when I brought it up to you
you didin't seem all interested.

14:50.660 --> 14:53.618
You don't thank someone for a gift
that they haven't recieved.

14:53.638 --> 14:55.730
Whatever, I don't
know all your rules.

14:58.204 --> 15:00.413
Man, you were supposed
to be my red hen.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.535
I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:02.555 --> 15:04.022
From Farmer Todd.

15:04.042 --> 15:06.691
The red hen
who gets everybody together

15:06.743 --> 15:08.521
and helps Todd save the farm.

15:08.541 --> 15:10.829
Well, hens are female.

15:11.151 --> 15:13.307
- So...
- It doesn't matter.

15:13.704 --> 15:16.384
Now I have to write
a whole different ending,

15:16.404 --> 15:18.953
because that bitch hen

15:19.039 --> 15:21.706
went to a different farm

15:21.791 --> 15:23.758
and abandoned Farmer Todd

15:23.844 --> 15:26.761
- just like everyone else!
- Can you blame her?!

15:26.847 --> 15:27.846
Or, I mean him!

15:27.881 --> 15:29.597
- Whatever it is!
- Oh.

15:29.683 --> 15:30.715
Congratulations!

15:30.800 --> 15:32.717
- You killed Farmer Todd!
- Good.

15:32.802 --> 15:33.935
I'm glad he's dead.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.386
He was an asshole!

15:35.406 --> 15:37.223
Good-bye forever.

15:41.244 --> 15:43.829
Who's got the Geo?
I'm blocked in.

15:43.849 --> 15:46.211
Lincoln, buddy,
we need your keys.

15:46.770 --> 15:48.867
Oh, no.

15:48.902 --> 15:51.819
Oh, God. Lincoln.

15:51.905 --> 15:53.705
Lincoln?

15:54.908 --> 15:56.799
Aw, Lincoln.

15:57.668 --> 15:59.711
I thought you said
he was six years sober.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.580
He really wanted
that internship.

16:02.666 --> 16:03.998
You got to be kidding.

16:04.084 --> 16:05.667
So this is now my fault?

16:05.752 --> 16:06.918
Maybe.

16:07.464 --> 16:09.587
I'll just move his car myself.

16:11.116 --> 16:12.974
Oh, my God.
Lincoln, no! Stop it!

16:13.059 --> 16:14.726
Get off of him.

16:14.761 --> 16:15.927
- Lincoln, get off of him!
- Aah! Stop it!

16:15.979 --> 16:17.595
Get off!
Lincoln, Lincoln, stop it.

16:17.681 --> 16:18.680
Stop it, Lincoln!

16:25.287 --> 16:26.771
What the hell, Lincoln?!

16:26.856 --> 16:28.806
Lincoln, are you okay?

16:28.875 --> 16:30.942
Is Lincoln okay?!

16:30.994 --> 16:33.313
Well, thanks for the coffee.

16:33.333 --> 16:35.780
Of course. You'll
get me next time.

16:39.344 --> 16:41.586
Nice to finally meet you.

16:45.265 --> 16:47.625
So, he didn't want to say
this in front of you,

16:47.711 --> 16:49.677
but, um, his deal fell through,

16:49.763 --> 16:52.081
and so he's just really
hurting right now.

16:52.101 --> 16:54.933
- He's hurting?
- Mm-hmm.

16:55.258 --> 16:57.018
It's okay, you know.

16:57.103 --> 16:58.970
Chase and I can stay
in the apartment.

16:59.022 --> 17:00.888
Abby...

17:00.974 --> 17:02.688
he's playing you.

17:02.708 --> 17:04.251
I know.

17:05.492 --> 17:06.634
Look...

17:06.654 --> 17:08.358
you don't have to be friends with me.

17:08.378 --> 17:10.012
I totally get it.

17:10.032 --> 17:11.226
What?

17:11.246 --> 17:12.983
I just know it's
hard to be friends

17:13.069 --> 17:14.986
with someone you can't respect.

17:15.823 --> 17:17.955
Well, it's also hard to be
friends with someone

17:17.991 --> 17:19.991
who can't keep their mouth shut.

17:21.965 --> 17:22.993
Little bit.

17:25.290 --> 17:26.830
I mean, that is
a really nice car

17:26.883 --> 17:28.285
for someone who's hurting.

17:28.305 --> 17:29.923
Yeah, he says he's keeping it
for business.

17:29.943 --> 17:31.660
You know, to keep
up appearances.

17:31.680 --> 17:33.455
And his girlfriend's new boobs...

17:33.540 --> 17:36.041
are those for business, too?

17:36.788 --> 17:39.569
I don't know. Maybe Jacob and I
need to have another talk.

17:39.589 --> 17:41.909
Maybe the time for talk is over.

17:42.331 --> 17:43.215
You think so?

17:43.250 --> 17:45.417
- I do.
- Okay.

17:45.469 --> 17:47.386
Oh, my God!

17:50.930 --> 17:53.057
- Are you insane?!
- Abby, what the hell?

17:53.077 --> 17:54.335
You crazy bitch!

17:54.355 --> 17:55.927
You said the time for
talk is over, right?

17:56.013 --> 17:58.299
I meant that you should take him back
to court!

17:58.319 --> 18:01.364
Lina, did you make her do this?
Oh, it's real funny, isn't it?

18:01.384 --> 18:03.878
- I could do that, too, I think.
- I'm not gonna pay for this!

18:04.927 --> 18:06.755
All right, man.

18:07.177 --> 18:09.463
What happened, huh?

18:09.548 --> 18:11.165
Your friend there tried to...

18:11.185 --> 18:12.800
- have his way with me.
- Come on, man.

18:12.885 --> 18:14.685
I was looking for your keys.

18:14.770 --> 18:17.855
I think you were looking
for something else.

18:18.373 --> 18:20.123
He went deep.

18:20.979 --> 18:22.610
Uh, actually,

18:22.645 --> 18:24.695
Lincoln, I think that he was

18:24.780 --> 18:26.563
looking for your keys.

18:26.649 --> 18:28.649
He wanted to move your car
so he could leave.

18:28.734 --> 18:30.985
We've been fighting lately,
and truth be told, we've been...

18:32.822 --> 18:35.608
talking about having
our friendship annulled.

18:35.628 --> 18:37.791
The disease turns us all
into little boys.

18:38.201 --> 18:39.910
- The disease, man, huh?
- Oh, my God.

18:39.996 --> 18:41.578
Would you stop
blaming the disease

18:41.664 --> 18:44.743
and just admit
that you're an asshole?

18:45.190 --> 18:46.344
Ok.

18:47.088 --> 18:49.843
I would admit maybe I am.

18:50.302 --> 18:51.394
But ever you got this

18:51.414 --> 18:54.591
fancy new job, you've been
pretty shitty yourself.

18:54.677 --> 18:56.593
'Cause the job sucks, okay?

18:57.104 --> 18:58.512
What do you want me to do?

18:58.564 --> 18:59.680
I need to make money.

18:59.765 --> 19:01.956
I need to spend time
with my family.

19:02.179 --> 19:03.517
That's okay.

19:03.569 --> 19:05.519
Uh, work, family.

19:05.571 --> 19:06.904
As long as I'm third.

19:06.989 --> 19:08.489
Well, there's the dog.

19:09.492 --> 19:10.691
Okay, fourth.

19:10.743 --> 19:11.692
And my grill.

19:11.744 --> 19:12.826
That's a nice grill.

19:12.862 --> 19:14.695
All right, top twelve,

19:14.780 --> 19:16.456
and that's my final offer.

19:17.583 --> 19:18.913
Deal.

19:20.068 --> 19:21.535
Hey.

19:22.016 --> 19:23.654
What kind of grill?

19:26.332 --> 19:27.541
What?

19:29.879 --> 19:31.679
It was...

19:31.714 --> 19:33.964
We're just sort of
busting each other's balls.

19:34.050 --> 19:35.878
- We weren't really talking about...
- Yeah, there's no...

19:35.898 --> 19:38.652
- Grill's not more important than me.
- You guys.
