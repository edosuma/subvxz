00:03.020 --> 00:04.421
I like how your wife
doesn't make us use coasters.

00:04.489 --> 00:07.124
She actually does, so
can you please do it? Thanks.

00:07.192 --> 00:08.192
Jeez.

00:08.260 --> 00:09.093
All right. Fine.

00:09.160 --> 00:09.960
Here you go.

00:10.028 --> 00:11.328
A little coaster.

00:11.396 --> 00:14.031
Oh...

00:14.099 --> 00:15.199
Oh, wow.

00:15.267 --> 00:16.033
Really?

00:16.101 --> 00:17.401
Weight Training for Dummies?

00:17.469 --> 00:19.203
I'm getting a home gym.

00:19.271 --> 00:21.071
And apparently, you're not
ashamed to admit you know

00:21.139 --> 00:22.373
absolutely nothing about it.

00:22.440 --> 00:23.173
Yeah. What?

00:23.241 --> 00:24.041
I'm not Chuck Norris.

00:24.109 --> 00:26.010
I don't know about a home
gym, so I get the book.

00:26.077 --> 00:28.479
Usually we have to root
around for your shortcomings

00:28.546 --> 00:31.482
like a pig hunting for truffles,
but this is just right in front

00:31.549 --> 00:32.415
of our faces.

00:32.484 --> 00:33.984
I like the books.

00:34.052 --> 00:35.185
They make things simple.

00:35.253 --> 00:37.655
Uh...
Did you just say "books"?

00:39.057 --> 00:40.057
That's a lot of books.

00:40.125 --> 00:41.558
I thought these were all Yellow Pages.

00:41.626 --> 00:43.193
Why would I keep Yellow Pages?

00:43.261 --> 00:45.729
Why would you keep a stack
of "How I'm a Dummy" books

00:45.797 --> 00:47.031
everywhere?

00:47.098 --> 00:49.433
Because this is my own
personal research library.

00:49.501 --> 00:50.768
Stretching for Dummies.

00:50.835 --> 00:51.769
Yeah.

00:51.836 --> 00:53.704
Holiday Entertaining for Dummies.

00:53.772 --> 00:55.639
Those things are high-
pressure situations.

00:55.707 --> 00:57.141
Cryptography for Dummies.

00:57.208 --> 00:57.641
Three seconds.

00:57.709 --> 00:58.609
What is cryptography?

00:58.677 --> 00:59.376
You know what?

00:59.444 --> 01:00.277
That one came in a set.

01:00.345 --> 01:01.312
Let's see what else.

01:01.379 --> 01:03.247
Oh, Kevin.

01:03.315 --> 01:04.281
Law for Dummies?

01:04.349 --> 01:05.282
I should have hid that one.

01:05.349 --> 01:07.017
You're a lawyer, Kevin.

01:07.085 --> 01:08.986
It's full of common
sense legal advice.

01:09.054 --> 01:10.487
Jesus.

01:10.555 --> 01:13.590
Oh... Mexico's Beach
Resorts for Dummies.

01:13.658 --> 01:14.591
Oh.

01:14.659 --> 01:16.293
How hard is it to hang out
on a beach in Mexico?

01:16.361 --> 01:18.228
Is there a How to Hide Your
Glaring Lack of Knowledge from

01:18.296 --> 01:19.129
Your Friends for Dummies?

01:19.197 --> 01:22.166
'Cause that's one you
should have bought.

01:22.286 --> 01:25.684
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:25.804 --> 01:27.237
Oh, come on, Andre.

01:27.305 --> 01:28.238
You're not really a doctor.

01:28.306 --> 01:29.406
Uh, I am a doctor.

01:29.474 --> 01:31.008
Andre, cut the shit, all right?

01:31.076 --> 01:31.508
It's just us.

01:31.576 --> 01:32.443
There's no girls around.

01:32.510 --> 01:34.311
You're-you're barely a doctor.

01:34.379 --> 01:35.346
I save lives.

01:35.413 --> 01:36.513
I make people look better.

01:36.581 --> 01:37.348
Oh, my God.

01:37.415 --> 01:38.649
Oh, speaking of which, um...

01:38.717 --> 01:39.583
Do you have any time this week?

01:39.651 --> 01:40.584
I need a haircut.

01:40.652 --> 01:41.752
I'm not a barber.

01:41.820 --> 01:43.987
I could give you a hair replacement.

01:44.055 --> 01:45.522
These week-two match-ups
are killing me.

01:45.590 --> 01:47.257
Yeah, you've got Kevin this week, man.

01:47.325 --> 01:48.092
He's stacked.

01:48.159 --> 01:49.693
You got any advice as
to what I should do?

01:49.761 --> 01:50.527
Yeah.

01:50.595 --> 01:52.096
Definitely.

01:52.163 --> 01:54.131
What, you want me to tell you?

01:55.467 --> 01:56.533
Are you crazy?

01:56.601 --> 01:58.168
Well, here's what I'm thinking.

01:58.236 --> 01:59.069
I got to throw a Hail Mary.

01:59.137 --> 02:01.271
I'm going to put Josh Cribbs in
as my flex and hope that he runs

02:01.339 --> 02:02.973
one back against Kansas City.

02:03.041 --> 02:04.208
Wow.

02:04.275 --> 02:05.109
That's creative.

02:05.176 --> 02:07.111
It's my only option, honestly.

02:07.178 --> 02:08.169
You know what is not an option?

02:08.289 --> 02:10.389
My law firm is making me do
community service again.

02:10.508 --> 02:11.715
What is it this time?

02:11.835 --> 02:13.649
They're sending me to a hospital
that helps

02:13.769 --> 02:15.519
 Make-A-Wish kid's dream come true.

02:15.587 --> 02:17.388
Well, I think you'll be making
his dream come true when

02:17.455 --> 02:19.289
you actually leave, but sounds fun.

02:19.357 --> 02:21.158
If, God forbid, someone went
down right now in this bar.

02:21.226 --> 02:22.159
Okay.

02:22.227 --> 02:24.027
What would be your first
course of action?

02:24.095 --> 02:26.196
Establish age and sex of the patient.

02:26.264 --> 02:27.398
103 years old, male.

02:27.465 --> 02:28.165
Probably old age.

02:28.233 --> 02:29.700
I'm not going to waste time on them.

02:29.768 --> 02:30.401
Oh, my God.

02:30.468 --> 02:31.135
See? Exactly.

02:31.202 --> 02:33.604
A normal doctor would have
tried to help the person.

02:33.671 --> 02:34.972
I save lives.

02:35.039 --> 02:37.307
When these women come into my
practice, some of them are

02:37.375 --> 02:38.976
really down on their bodies.

02:39.043 --> 02:40.577
You're doing the Lord's work, buddy.

02:40.645 --> 02:41.311
Thank you.

02:41.379 --> 02:42.045
I know I am.

02:42.113 --> 02:42.679
Okay.

02:42.747 --> 02:44.248
You guys might find this interesting.

02:44.315 --> 02:45.983
Well, I think that's an assumption.

02:46.050 --> 02:49.119
I am thinking of
expanding my practice.

02:49.187 --> 02:50.454
I met this doctor, Dr. Maxwell.

02:50.522 --> 02:51.722
Real class act.

02:51.790 --> 02:54.057
Is he, uh...
Is he black?

02:54.125 --> 02:55.125
How did you know?

02:55.193 --> 02:57.694
Nine times out of ten, when a
sportscaster is referring to

02:57.762 --> 02:58.729
someone as a "class act,"

02:58.797 --> 03:00.998
they're talking about a
head coach who's black.

03:01.065 --> 03:01.565
Mm-hmm.

03:01.633 --> 03:02.266
Tony Dungy.

03:02.333 --> 03:03.100
What a class act.

03:03.168 --> 03:03.667
Total.

03:03.735 --> 03:04.968
Lovie Smith.

03:05.036 --> 03:06.036
Class act.

03:06.104 --> 03:06.970
Class act.

03:07.038 --> 03:08.138
I never noticed that.

03:08.206 --> 03:09.973
I mean, that happens all the time.

03:10.041 --> 03:10.974
It's not just football.

03:11.042 --> 03:13.343
Sportscasters use these code
words in all of the sports.

03:13.411 --> 03:16.246
Uh, if they're talking about a
Latino player in baseball, like

03:16.314 --> 03:18.582
Ozzie Guillen is, a...
Firecracker.

03:18.650 --> 03:19.283
Firecracker.

03:19.350 --> 03:20.918
Latin guys are always
"firecracker."

03:20.985 --> 03:21.652
Spark plug.

03:21.719 --> 03:23.120
Spark plug in the clubhouse.

03:23.188 --> 03:23.620
Mm-hmm.

03:23.688 --> 03:27.124
Wes Welker is, like, a gym
rat, a real scrappy player.

03:27.192 --> 03:28.959
Yeah, which is code word for white.

03:29.027 --> 03:29.927
Always a white guy.

03:29.994 --> 03:34.431
Ichiro Suzuki is...
Inscrutable.

03:34.499 --> 03:35.599
Yes.

03:35.667 --> 03:36.333
There you go.

03:36.401 --> 03:38.602
All right, well, this is exactly
what I don't want to be.

03:38.670 --> 03:40.637
I don't want to be racist.

03:40.705 --> 03:42.706
I don't know what's racist
and what's not racist.

03:42.774 --> 03:43.574
Neither do I.

03:43.641 --> 03:45.309
So, call him African American, then?

03:45.376 --> 03:46.243
No, you can say "black."

03:46.311 --> 03:47.110
I'm not offended.

03:47.178 --> 03:48.078
Why would you be offended?

03:48.146 --> 03:49.413
I'm half black.

03:49.481 --> 03:52.049
Mom is Italian.

03:52.116 --> 03:52.649
Oh, I know.

03:52.717 --> 03:54.051
I'm black on the inside.

03:54.118 --> 03:55.152
What are you up here?

03:55.220 --> 03:57.454
A race car driver.

03:57.522 --> 03:58.655
What lap are you on?

03:58.723 --> 04:00.390
33.

04:00.458 --> 04:02.493
Uh, anyone want to go see
a movie tonight? Pete?

04:02.560 --> 04:03.260
No, I'm good.

04:03.328 --> 04:04.127
I got a date tonight.

04:04.195 --> 04:05.629
You going out with Brooke again?

04:05.697 --> 04:06.630
Yep.

04:06.698 --> 04:07.631
You all cool with that?

04:07.699 --> 04:08.565
Yeah, that's fine.

04:08.633 --> 04:09.433
It was ages ago.

04:09.501 --> 04:11.869
You don't mind having sex with
someone that Kevin has also

04:11.936 --> 04:13.070
had sex with?

04:13.137 --> 04:15.172
No, I mean, it's basically
like a public bathroom.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.140
Do I know people who
have been in there?

04:17.208 --> 04:17.940
Sure.

04:18.009 --> 04:19.409
But I like to pretend I'm the first.

04:19.476 --> 04:20.476
Oh, yeah.

04:20.545 --> 04:22.312
'Cause you guys are Eskimo brothers.

04:23.147 --> 04:24.948
Now, if you could just get rid
of this pesky girl, the two

04:25.016 --> 04:27.661
of you guys could be
in th igloo all by yourselves,

04:28.073 --> 04:30.375
- Use some ** for lube.
- Thank you.

04:30.495 --> 04:33.090
What was her nickname in high school?
She was in your class, right, Taco?

04:33.157 --> 04:33.657
What did you call her?

04:33.725 --> 04:35.459
Was she a gym rat or a spark plug?

04:35.527 --> 04:36.627
No, she had a funny name.

04:36.694 --> 04:38.562
It was, um...
The White Knuckler.

04:38.630 --> 04:39.930
Oh, right.

04:39.998 --> 04:41.965
'Cause when she gave you a hand
job, she'd squeeze so tight, you

04:42.033 --> 04:43.634
could actually see the
whites of her knuckles.

04:43.701 --> 04:44.635
Yup.

04:44.702 --> 04:46.537
I can't speak to what happened
in the past, but I can

04:46.604 --> 04:48.605
assure you, she's worked out
all the kinks since, okay?

04:48.673 --> 04:49.673
Old habits die hard.

04:49.741 --> 04:51.408
I got to get out of here, guys.

04:51.476 --> 04:52.309
I have to leave, too.

04:52.377 --> 04:53.610
I have a martial arts class.

04:53.678 --> 04:54.978
Ooh. Looky, looky.

04:55.046 --> 04:55.979
Really?

04:56.047 --> 04:56.480
Really, yeah.

04:56.548 --> 04:57.314
I really enjoy it.

04:57.382 --> 05:00.617
It teaches me focus,
discipline, and focus.

05:00.685 --> 05:05.489
Uh, that's your third beer, Taco.

05:08.026 --> 05:10.294
Namaste, Taco.

05:12.330 --> 05:15.532
You've se Kevin and he's
cool with the whole... us?

05:15.600 --> 05:16.833
Totally cool with it.

05:16.901 --> 05:18.235
Yeah? That's good.

05:18.303 --> 05:20.938
Yeah, I mean, I'm cool with it,
and I'm glad you can bring

05:21.005 --> 05:22.573
it up, and it sounds like
you're cool with it.

05:22.640 --> 05:23.540
I'm totally cool with it.

05:23.608 --> 05:24.441
And I think we're cool.

05:24.509 --> 05:25.876
Oh.

05:28.279 --> 05:29.212
All right.

05:30.281 --> 05:31.615
So, what's Kevin been up to?

05:31.683 --> 05:34.918
He's got this home gym
obsession right now.

05:34.986 --> 05:36.420
So I'm going to go
work out over there.

05:36.487 --> 05:37.120
What?

05:37.188 --> 05:39.089
Oh, yeah, he's...
Kevin has a home gym?

05:39.157 --> 05:40.557
Yeah, he...
Oh, that's right.

05:40.625 --> 05:41.258
I forgot.

05:41.326 --> 05:43.193
You haven't seen him in, like...
It was almost ten years ago,

05:43.261 --> 05:45.929
and he had, like...
Yeah, he had that, like, flabby

05:45.997 --> 05:48.165
thing on his arm and he was...
Wait, wait.

05:48.232 --> 05:49.166
Under here, by the way.

05:49.233 --> 05:50.167
Look, he was a pudgy guy.

05:50.234 --> 05:51.501
I mean...
We all make mistakes.

05:51.569 --> 05:52.202
We do.

05:52.270 --> 05:56.073
That was a long time ago, so...
I remember, in high school,

05:56.140 --> 05:57.908
always thinking...
To his credit, he had, like, a

05:57.976 --> 06:00.043
really pretty cock.

06:00.111 --> 06:00.978
Excuse me?

06:01.045 --> 06:04.147
I just feel like the male
anatomy is always so sort of

06:04.215 --> 06:06.350
grotesque, and it's like
watching a science fiction film

06:06.417 --> 06:07.217
down there.

06:07.285 --> 06:09.086
But he had, like...
He had, like a really pretty

06:09.153 --> 06:10.954
cock and cute balls.

06:11.022 --> 06:13.357
It was, like, a really elegant
package, to be honest.

06:13.424 --> 06:16.493
Hmm. Um...
I just, like, realized that

06:16.561 --> 06:18.362
that's probably, like,
not the greatest...

06:18.429 --> 06:20.197
Like, I don't... I don't mean...
Oh, no, no.

06:20.264 --> 06:21.898
I didn't mean it in,
like, a weird way.

06:21.966 --> 06:24.067
That was just something that I...
Totally fine with it.

06:24.135 --> 06:25.068
I'm not thinking about it.

06:25.136 --> 06:27.037
You're clearly thinking
about his penis.

06:27.105 --> 06:29.473
You're not... I mean...
I am not thinking about Kevin's penis.

06:29.540 --> 06:32.609
That's not... That's not even...
It's not something for us to think about.

06:32.677 --> 06:36.749
Mm-mmm. No.
We don't even need to even think about it.

06:38.316 --> 06:40.350
I feel like you're still
thinking about it.

06:40.418 --> 06:42.352
A little bit.

06:44.952 --> 06:46.489
So, Colin, what do you think?

06:46.609 --> 06:48.387
Let's get this wish thing happening.

06:48.454 --> 06:49.154
What do you want?

06:49.222 --> 06:51.757
Um, I want to meet a
pro football player.

06:51.824 --> 06:55.160
Okay. I want to meet a
pro football player.

06:56.104 --> 07:01.967
In fact, I have a roster of pro
football players that we can meet.

07:02.035 --> 07:04.269
Huh-ho.

07:04.337 --> 07:06.772
Well, I want to meet my
favorite player, Baltimore

07:06.839 --> 07:07.806
linebacker Terrell Suggs.

07:07.874 --> 07:10.008
Well, he's a defensive player,
and I don't even have

07:10.076 --> 07:12.578
that defense, so that's not happening.

07:12.645 --> 07:17.983
But I do have Josh Cribbs,
Cleveland Browns' kick returner?

07:18.051 --> 07:18.884
I don't know.

07:18.952 --> 07:20.052
Terrell Suggs is my wish.

07:20.119 --> 07:22.788
Yeah, well, my wish was for a
house on Nantucket and the

07:22.855 --> 07:25.023
respect of my peers, but
we get what we get.

07:25.091 --> 07:26.592
You're from Baltimore, huh?

07:26.659 --> 07:27.125
Yup.

07:27.193 --> 07:28.260
You watch The Wire?

07:28.328 --> 07:29.595
No.

07:29.662 --> 07:30.762
Oh, show's brutal.

07:30.830 --> 07:33.131
You should check it out on Blu-ray.

07:33.199 --> 07:34.099
Come on! Josh Cribbs!

07:34.167 --> 07:36.368
All-time leading NFL kick returner.

07:36.436 --> 07:38.136
I guess that's pretty cool.

07:38.204 --> 07:39.204
We got a deal?

07:39.272 --> 07:40.205
Let's do this.

07:40.273 --> 07:41.373
What is this?

07:41.441 --> 07:42.708
This is pretty depressing stuff.

07:42.775 --> 07:43.875
Yeah.

07:43.943 --> 07:46.225
You're going through some shit, huh?

07:47.714 --> 07:48.647
Josh Cribbs!

07:48.715 --> 07:50.816
You're gonna meet Josh Cribbs?

07:50.883 --> 07:52.951
No.
Not only am I gonna meet him.

07:53.019 --> 07:54.953
I'm going to be able to ask him
to make my wish come true.

07:55.021 --> 07:57.055
You mean, the kid's
wish come true, Ruxin.

07:57.123 --> 07:58.863
Melanoma, melanamea.

07:59.024 --> 08:00.353
- All right?
- Really?

08:00.473 --> 08:03.958
Yeah. I'm gonna be able to say
to him, "I know this poor sick kid

08:04.078 --> 08:08.009
and his wish is for you to have
the game of a lifetime this weekend.

08:08.129 --> 08:12.189
If you don't return two kickoffs
for touchdowns, maybe a buck 50

08:12.309 --> 08:15.875
multipurpose yards, this
poor little kid's gonna die disappointed.

08:15.995 --> 08:18.390
Can you do that for
me, Josh Cribbs?"

08:18.577 --> 08:22.165
"Yeah, I can do that for you, Ruxin,
but only if you go Jet Skiing with me."

08:22.285 --> 08:23.853
"Okay, Cribbs, I can do that."

08:23.973 --> 08:25.312
I'm gonna crush you this weekend.

08:25.432 --> 08:26.704
How do you even sleep at night?

08:26.824 --> 08:28.759
Usually on my side with a
pillow between my legs.

08:28.879 --> 08:31.530
Ellie, can you please be careful up there?!
Thank you.

08:31.650 --> 08:32.472
Hey, guys.

08:32.592 --> 08:34.395
Jesus, what the...
What are you doing?!

08:34.515 --> 08:35.746
What is that?

08:35.866 --> 08:38.059
What? It's a short-sleeved plaid shirt.
I've worn it before.

08:38.179 --> 08:39.832
Not the...
The gigantic spear you brought.

08:39.952 --> 08:42.784
Oh, it's for my martial arts class.
It's a naginata.

08:42.905 --> 08:46.793
Speclizing in the art of wielding
the naginata, known as the naginatajutsu.

08:46.913 --> 08:47.791
Jesus!

08:47.911 --> 08:49.536
Okay, relax, man.

08:49.656 --> 08:52.217
No. Put it away, Taco.
This is a park.

08:52.337 --> 08:54.693
- There are little kids.
- It's ok, look, no one's around.

08:54.813 --> 08:56.311
I'm not gonna hurt...
Whoa!

08:56.431 --> 08:57.253
Oh, my God!

08:57.373 --> 08:58.917
You cut the doll's head off.

08:58.985 --> 09:01.520
You were a worthy opponent,
little one, but no one survives

09:01.587 --> 09:03.284
the wrath of my blade.

09:03.404 --> 09:04.317
Put it away.

09:04.437 --> 09:05.023
What?

09:05.091 --> 09:06.401
Put it away, and get out of here.

09:06.521 --> 09:07.724
All right, fine.

09:09.295 --> 09:10.595
What does that mean?

09:10.663 --> 09:13.932
That's made up Japanese for, "I'm
gonna go get high right now."

09:15.168 --> 09:17.035
Oh, God.

09:21.158 --> 09:22.875
Did you start a legal
fund for him yet?

09:23.269 --> 09:24.915
Can't we just plead frittata?

09:25.035 --> 09:26.392
There is a precedent for it.

09:26.512 --> 09:28.520
Yeah!

09:28.640 --> 09:31.010
I want to tell you what
my ten-year plan is.

09:31.130 --> 09:34.972
I'm a doctor, but I also
need to be a personality.

09:35.092 --> 09:38.557
Those guys that are on that show Doctors...
Love it.

09:38.624 --> 09:39.691
Well, me, too.

09:39.759 --> 09:41.026
They're making a mint.

09:41.094 --> 09:42.094
And you know why?

09:42.161 --> 09:43.562
They put their face on a cream.

09:43.629 --> 09:45.831
They've put their face on an ointment.

09:45.898 --> 09:47.966
It's all about becoming the authority.

09:48.034 --> 09:51.269
I want to become the Sanjay
Gupta of plastic surgery.

09:51.337 --> 09:52.604
Right.

09:52.672 --> 09:55.140
You know, what Halliburton
does for weapons, I want to do

09:55.208 --> 09:56.308
for dermabrasion.

09:56.375 --> 09:57.709
You know what I mean?

09:57.777 --> 10:00.312
I want to be the Pinkberry
of plastic surgery.

10:00.379 --> 10:02.355
I love that. I love that.

10:02.475 --> 10:05.050
I mean, that's one of the
reasons I agreed to meet with you today si

10:05.289 --> 10:09.635
it seems to me like you and I...
we have the same mind for things.

10:09.680 --> 10:13.631
What I love about you is
that you can open up doors.

10:13.751 --> 10:17.074
I mean, when people see your
face, you know, it can really

10:17.194 --> 10:23.665
- get a wider kind of, you know,
patient base and... - Diversify.

10:24.498 --> 10:26.088
Is that... Is that the word
you're looking for, or...?

10:26.208 --> 10:29.001
No, no, no, no, I did not...
I did not say that.

10:29.121 --> 10:35.883
I didn't. I don't...I don't like diversity,
'cause it is... racist.

10:36.003 --> 10:37.616
You're not a fan of diversity, or...?

10:37.683 --> 10:39.918
I... I'm not talking about
putting that out there.

10:39.986 --> 10:41.086
I'm colorblind.

10:41.154 --> 10:44.370
I had a lot of black friends
when I was growing up.

10:44.490 --> 10:47.094
You know, like-like, one
of my best friends, Percy.

10:47.214 --> 10:47.926
Percy?

10:47.994 --> 10:49.094
Percy, yeah.

10:49.162 --> 10:51.433
His mom made great food.

10:51.553 --> 10:54.640
You'd spend the night...
Yeah, yeah.

10:54.760 --> 10:55.984
You'd spend the night?

10:56.336 --> 10:59.944
I didn't spend nights there,
because my parents didn't like

11:00.064 --> 11:01.168
the part of town that he lived in.

11:01.288 --> 11:02.449
Where is Percy now?

11:03.022 --> 11:04.042
He's in prison.

11:04.309 --> 11:05.610
- Yeah.
- Oh.

11:05.678 --> 11:09.922
Um... yeah, I'm gonna write that down.
I'm gonna send a care package to him.

11:11.174 --> 11:12.951
Watch my form.
See, I don't break my wrist.

11:13.019 --> 11:13.952
 I saw it.

11:15.021 --> 11:16.121
Come on. Watch!

11:16.189 --> 11:17.222
You got to watch my form!

11:17.290 --> 11:19.791
I'm watching. I...
That's the key.

11:19.859 --> 11:21.726
Oh, God. Ugh!

11:21.794 --> 11:22.894
All right, let's hit those pecs.

11:22.962 --> 11:24.062
All right, fine.

11:24.130 --> 11:25.230
God, let's do the bench.

11:25.298 --> 11:27.732
I'll spot you, and you spot...
No spot, please.

11:27.800 --> 11:28.733
Yes. No, no, no.

11:28.801 --> 11:30.836
Weight Training for Dummies
says, safety first.

11:30.903 --> 11:32.838
Look, I don't give a shit what it says.
You go curl.

11:32.905 --> 11:35.841
I don't need a spot...
I'm on posture patrol, all right?

11:35.908 --> 11:38.009
I don't care what patrol you're on.
I'm...

11:38.077 --> 11:39.044
Don't make me sit on you!

11:39.111 --> 11:39.978
All right.

11:40.046 --> 11:41.146
All right, I got it.

11:41.214 --> 11:42.147
I'm fine.

11:42.215 --> 11:43.181
Here we go. Open your eyes.

11:43.249 --> 11:44.349
No, I'm good closed.

11:44.417 --> 11:46.852
No. Weight Training for
Dummies specifically says you

11:46.919 --> 11:47.786
have to open your eyes.

11:47.854 --> 11:48.954
I don't want to. Ugh!

11:49.021 --> 11:49.955
Oh, God! Ugh!

11:50.022 --> 11:51.122
One, two, three.

11:51.190 --> 11:52.290
Push, push.

11:52.358 --> 11:53.358
You look at me.

11:53.426 --> 11:54.693
We'll get through this together.

11:54.760 --> 11:55.727
Push, come on.

11:55.795 --> 11:56.661
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

11:56.729 --> 11:57.796
I can't do... I can't do it.

11:57.864 --> 11:58.964
Aw, come on, man.

11:59.031 --> 11:59.898
You can do it.

11:59.966 --> 12:00.932
No, I can't. I'm sorry.

12:01.000 --> 12:01.967
What's the problem?

12:02.034 --> 12:04.302
There's no problem. I just...

12:07.711 --> 12:10.074
- She told you about my pretty cock.
- No.

12:09.275 --> 12:10.193
No!

12:10.194 --> 12:11.002
Yes!

12:11.122 --> 12:13.183
That's what this whole thing is.

12:13.303 --> 12:15.998
You couldn't look at me before,
you're weird right now.

12:16.882 --> 12:18.863
- I have a pretty cock.
- Don't say that, okay?

12:18.983 --> 12:21.658
I don't want to spend any
more time thinking about or

12:21.659 --> 12:26.091
visualizing what your PC may
or may not look like, okay?

12:26.211 --> 12:27.142
Just do me a favor.
Do you know what I'm saying?

12:27.262 --> 12:28.187
My eyes are up here.

12:28.307 --> 12:30.572
I'm-I'm looking right...Just please look me
in the eyes. I'm not a piece of meat.

12:31.330 --> 12:32.630
Thank you.

12:35.289 --> 12:36.555
Focus.

12:36.907 --> 12:39.271
Focus, focus, focus.

12:40.975 --> 12:42.288
You're playing terribly.

12:42.724 --> 12:44.314
Can I ask you some advice?

12:44.553 --> 12:45.453
Yeah.

12:45.693 --> 12:47.659
I have no idea who to start this week.

12:47.660 --> 12:50.353
I-I... I picked up,
you know, Ryan Grant.

12:50.473 --> 12:51.303
He's injured.

12:51.584 --> 12:52.477
You know that, right?

12:52.597 --> 12:53.408
What?!

12:53.528 --> 12:56.306
God damn it. I'm...
Man, I'm losing my mojo, and

12:56.426 --> 12:59.828
it is all about Kevin's
pretty little cock.

13:01.069 --> 13:04.562
So you're saying that Kevin's
beautiful cock is tearing you up inside?

13:04.630 --> 13:07.165
Yes.

13:07.233 --> 13:09.004
Awful.

13:09.124 --> 13:12.575
Gentlemen, you are looking at
a man with a life partner.

13:12.695 --> 13:16.820
Guys, the meeting with Dr.
Maxwell went dope, okay?

13:16.940 --> 13:18.381
So good, we're gonna do it.

13:18.501 --> 13:19.619
We're gonna merge practices.

13:19.739 --> 13:23.202
To celebrate, we're gonna have a
big old party, Diddy-style, you know?

13:23.322 --> 13:25.151
You know that just 'cause you're working with
a black guy

13:25.271 --> 13:26.966
doesn't make you black by association.

13:27.086 --> 13:28.514
- Aye.
- Hy, real quick.

13:28.634 --> 13:32.333
In your professional medical
opinion, are some penises, say,

13:32.453 --> 13:33.996
prettier than others would be?

13:34.116 --> 13:35.712
Oh, absolutely, yeah.

13:35.832 --> 13:37.259
The one thing you can't fix.

13:37.379 --> 13:38.964
Ugly penis.

13:42.434 --> 13:45.903
Yeah, maybe it's not the stroller's fault,
but the people pushing the stroller.

13:45.970 --> 13:47.237
Did you ever think about that?

13:47.305 --> 13:48.405
Oh, okay, I got to go.

13:48.473 --> 13:51.807
I got to go. Oh, Josh Cribbs!

13:51.927 --> 13:54.013
- Rodney?
- Yeah. People call me Ruxin.

13:54.133 --> 13:58.028
People are gonna call you a champion for
making everybody's dreams come true today.

13:58.148 --> 13:59.351
Thank you.
I really appreciate that.

13:59.471 --> 14:01.067
Yeah. Hey, you want to
go grab some sushi?

14:01.094 --> 14:01.898
In a hospital?

14:02.018 --> 14:02.869
No, no, no, no.

14:02.989 --> 14:03.783
It's this other place.

14:03.903 --> 14:04.965
Best place in Chicago.

14:05.085 --> 14:06.301
Great sashimi.

14:06.568 --> 14:08.555
Uh, I kind of want to
get up and see Colin.

14:08.675 --> 14:10.567
Aw, we got plenty of
time to go see Colin.

14:11.340 --> 14:12.911
I... don't think he has
a lot of time left.

14:13.031 --> 14:15.767
All right, not enough time for
sushi... maybe we run by my

14:15.799 --> 14:17.342
friend's office...
Josh Cribbs!

14:17.462 --> 14:18.616
Colin!

14:18.736 --> 14:20.371
- Hey!
- How you doing, buddy?

14:20.491 --> 14:21.623
I'm doing good.

14:21.743 --> 14:23.579
Have you ever been to
a pro football game?

14:23.699 --> 14:24.662
No, I haven't.

14:24.782 --> 14:27.222
Oh, man, you should come
sometime... you'd be my guest.

14:27.342 --> 14:29.103
Oh, really?
Bring your whole family.

14:29.223 --> 14:31.410
Really? The whole family?

14:31.530 --> 14:34.890
What are we talking about,
boxes, field pass, all-access?

14:35.010 --> 14:36.972
You're kind of freaking the
kid out a little bit here.

14:37.092 --> 14:38.182
Nah, he's cool.

14:38.302 --> 14:39.969
You just kind of seem desperate.

14:40.089 --> 14:40.842
You seem desperate.

14:40.962 --> 14:43.489
- Uh, hey, Colin, uh, you
want to play catch? - Sure.

14:43.609 --> 14:44.586
Oh, cool.

14:45.205 --> 14:47.519
All right, let me see that cannon.
All right, put it right here.

14:47.997 --> 14:49.913
- Ah. Good throw, good throw.
- Thanks.

14:50.033 --> 14:51.897
Oh! Troy Polamalu!

14:52.017 --> 14:54.289
Just kidding.
Josh Cribbs coming out, spin move!

14:54.409 --> 14:56.795
No, it's not Josh Cribbs.
Uh, Josh Cribbs doesn't do that.

14:56.915 --> 14:57.653
Okay.

14:57.773 --> 14:59.102
Hey, dude, we were playing.

14:59.222 --> 15:00.157
Oh, cool, man.

15:00.734 --> 15:01.799
Go play down there.

15:03.037 --> 15:06.995
Uh... He's such a courageous little
guy, and you've been so amazing with him.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.513
You know, we should spend a
little more time hanging out,

15:09.633 --> 15:12.472
maybe we could talk about what
to do that's best for Colin.

15:12.725 --> 15:15.026
Actually, my friends are
having a party tomorrow night.

15:15.146 --> 15:16.517
It'll be a kickass time.

15:16.637 --> 15:18.927
- You should come hang.
- Oh, we gonna invite Colin?

15:19.264 --> 15:21.546
- Ew. He's not gonna be that much fun.
- Ruxin.

15:21.666 --> 15:23.389
All right, cool.
Yeah, the kid can come.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.902
- You're a real class act, Josh Cribbs.
- I appreciate that, man.

15:26.022 --> 15:26.887
Thanks a lot.

15:27.007 --> 15:28.463
Can I...
should we do it like that?

15:28.583 --> 15:30.896
Uh...
nah, nah, not like that.

15:31.016 --> 15:32.160
Okay.

15:32.280 --> 15:33.484
Thank you.

15:33.604 --> 15:34.738
Oh, this is great.

15:34.805 --> 15:36.106
Guys, good to see you.

15:36.173 --> 15:37.374
All right. How are you?

15:37.441 --> 15:39.376
I like this, I like what's going on.

15:39.443 --> 15:40.677
Cheers to our future.

15:40.745 --> 15:41.811
Success.

15:41.879 --> 15:42.946
Oh, boy.

15:43.014 --> 15:43.980
Oh, my God, Kevin!

15:45.049 --> 15:45.982
Oh, Brooke.

15:46.050 --> 15:47.083
Yeah, you know Kevin.

15:47.151 --> 15:48.151
Let me get you a drink.

15:48.219 --> 15:51.419
I know, but it's been so long.
God, you look... You look great.

15:51.539 --> 15:53.965
- Thank you.
- You wanna drink or something?

15:54.085 --> 15:55.878
Yeah, um...

15:55.998 --> 15:57.599
Hey, Rudy, we're just
catching up over here.

15:57.667 --> 15:58.728
I haven't seen him in so long.

15:58.848 --> 15:59.865
So what are you, you're
married now, right?

15:59.985 --> 16:02.355
I am, yeah, and we have a
six-year-old daughter.

16:02.475 --> 16:03.753
That blows my mind.

16:03.873 --> 16:05.142
Yeah, she's Ellie.
She's so perfectly formed.

16:05.262 --> 16:06.915
Oh, that's sweet.

16:07.035 --> 16:07.942
Pretty.

16:08.062 --> 16:10.604
Uh, oh, uh, guys?

16:11.076 --> 16:14.442
"Whites only.
Strictly enforced."

16:14.822 --> 16:16.243
Do you think he knows?

16:16.363 --> 16:18.074
Guys! Welcome...
Nah.

16:18.194 --> 16:20.494
...to Andre's white party.

16:20.614 --> 16:22.618
We have an amazing night planned.

16:22.753 --> 16:25.689
Taco is going to be performing
later in the evening, and Dr.

16:25.756 --> 16:29.793
Maxwell brought some of his...
clientele, so mingle.

16:29.860 --> 16:32.028
Hey, sheriff from the Deep South.

16:32.096 --> 16:33.496
Hey, partner!

16:33.564 --> 16:36.466
Oh, uh, when are the German
shepherds and the firehoses coming?

16:36.534 --> 16:37.300
Wh-What?

16:37.368 --> 16:39.569
It's racist.

16:39.637 --> 16:43.494
Oh. No, no, no, I meant...
I meant clothing.

16:45.576 --> 16:48.078
It's clothing. It's clothing.

16:48.145 --> 16:49.846
You guys are class acts.

16:49.914 --> 16:50.814
Thanks for coming.

16:50.881 --> 16:51.948
It's clothing.

16:52.016 --> 16:53.483
It's clothing.

16:53.551 --> 16:55.585
Just take the sign, Andre.

16:55.653 --> 16:56.720
Oh... hello!

16:56.787 --> 16:57.587
Hey!

16:58.522 --> 17:00.090
Look who the cat dragged in.

17:00.157 --> 17:03.960
Look who it is... it's me and
my confidante, Josh Cribbs!

17:04.028 --> 17:04.961
How you doing?

17:05.029 --> 17:05.996
Josh Cribbs, hi.

17:06.063 --> 17:07.230
How about that.

17:07.298 --> 17:09.332
Is that a child behind you?

17:09.400 --> 17:12.502
Oh, yeah, this is, um...
This is Colin.

17:12.569 --> 17:13.435
Colin.

17:13.503 --> 17:14.037
Hi.

17:14.105 --> 17:14.804
Hi.

17:14.872 --> 17:15.905
Kevin. Nice to meet you.

17:15.973 --> 17:17.906
You look well, like an angel.

17:17.974 --> 17:20.143
Yeah, let's not talk about
Heaven in front of him, okay?

17:20.211 --> 17:21.310
You're a dick.

17:21.378 --> 17:23.380
You guys are making
his dream come true.

17:23.446 --> 17:24.981
Together...
Together.

17:25.049 --> 17:26.049
...we are dream makers.

17:26.117 --> 17:27.684
Okay, we'll see.

17:27.752 --> 17:28.618
Colin!

17:28.686 --> 17:29.552
Hey, Terrell Suggs!

17:29.620 --> 17:30.520
What's up, man?

17:30.588 --> 17:31.554
How you doing?

17:31.622 --> 17:32.656
Terrell, what's up, baby?

17:32.723 --> 17:33.590
How you doing, man?

17:33.658 --> 17:34.524
Wow!

17:34.592 --> 17:35.659
What is he doing here?

17:35.726 --> 17:38.428
Colin's big wish was
to meet Terrell Suggs.

17:38.496 --> 17:40.397
So I said, I'll write a letter.

17:40.464 --> 17:43.667
Boom, Terrell gets it, invite him
to the party... look how that

17:43.734 --> 17:44.467
worked out.

17:44.535 --> 17:45.869
This is completely unfair.

17:45.936 --> 17:46.936
You have the Baltimore dee.

17:47.004 --> 17:47.904
Do I?

17:47.972 --> 17:51.274
So, Colin, let's make
this wish come true.

17:51.342 --> 17:53.977
What exactly can I do
to make that happen?

17:54.045 --> 17:57.013
Um, I think I'm gonna field
this one, all right, honcho?

17:57.081 --> 17:59.382
I think Colin would love if
you sacked the quarterback,

17:59.450 --> 18:02.085
like, three or four times, and
maybe even returned a fumble for

18:02.153 --> 18:03.797
a touchdown.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.597
I don't know, but I think he
would love a bucketful of points.

18:06.717 --> 18:08.848
- Right? - Yes.
- Cool. - So, hold on, hold on.

18:08.968 --> 18:12.122
So his wish was to meet...

18:12.242 --> 18:13.419
Eh-eh, eh-eh.

18:13.539 --> 18:16.265
This little guy doesn't know
which wish is which, because his

18:16.385 --> 18:18.924
brain is filled with
fungus and bacterias.

18:19.408 --> 18:20.308
Who is this?

18:20.376 --> 18:21.142
So, hold on.

18:21.210 --> 18:24.212
Returning a kickoff for a
touchdown, a hundred all-purpose yards...

18:24.280 --> 18:26.019
That was all
you, not for Colin?

18:26.139 --> 18:28.389
You're still making a young
man's dream come true.

18:28.509 --> 18:30.526
I just felt my hamstring tighten up.

18:30.646 --> 18:32.214
Colin, let's go, man.

18:32.334 --> 18:33.832
Come on, man, let's get
out of here, Colin.

18:34.676 --> 18:36.104
Rest that hammy.

18:37.727 --> 18:39.961
God, where do you think
they're going right now?

18:40.029 --> 18:41.758
I don't know, but I wish
I could go with them.

18:42.292 --> 18:46.570
Ladies and gentlemen, the
performance is about to begin.

19:01.317 --> 19:03.585
Naginata, naginata,
check out my naginata.

19:03.653 --> 19:06.069
Naginata, everyone...
He's talking about the spear, right?

19:06.189 --> 19:08.306
Yes, but n-no one else knows that.

19:08.426 --> 19:12.150
It is so cool and awesome.
Everybody should have one.

19:12.270 --> 19:14.078
Naginata, please.

19:14.198 --> 19:17.198
Oh, there are so few things
that bring me joy like this.

19:17.266 --> 19:20.362
Try practicing
with a naginata.

19:20.482 --> 19:22.725
The exercise will do you good.

19:22.845 --> 19:25.458
You'll be the coolest
guy in your hood.

19:25.578 --> 19:27.639
With niginatas like this!

19:29.705 --> 19:30.992
Naginata, naginata.

19:31.128 --> 19:32.217
Love my naginata.

19:32.285 --> 19:33.585
Naginata, naginata.

19:33.653 --> 19:34.686
That's my naginata.

19:34.754 --> 19:38.931
Naginata, naginata... Dr.
Nosik, our partnership's over.

19:39.051 --> 19:40.492
You're my naginata.

19:40.560 --> 19:41.560
Naginata, naginata.

19:41.628 --> 19:42.861
Sexy naginata.

19:42.929 --> 19:43.862
Naginata, naginata.

19:43.930 --> 19:46.298
That's what I'm....
Uh, please, don't go.

19:46.366 --> 19:47.599
It's just one song.

19:49.268 --> 19:50.369
Aaah! God! Oh!

19:50.932 --> 19:52.371
Oh, God! Oh! Oh, God!

19:52.438 --> 19:55.647
Oh, my God, it hit it!
It hit it! It hit my dick!

19:55.767 --> 19:57.374
Everybody, this man has been hit!

19:57.494 --> 19:58.289
Oh, no shit!

19:58.409 --> 20:00.033
Don't worry, everybody, I'm a doctor!

20:00.153 --> 20:01.454
Oh, God, I don't want calf implants!

20:01.574 --> 20:03.248
Listen, his femoral artery's been hit!

20:03.316 --> 20:04.837
And his penis has been hit.

20:04.957 --> 20:06.818
Looks like somebody's cock
got a little less pretty.

20:06.886 --> 20:09.507
Goddamn it, Taco, I told you
that thing was dangerous!

20:09.627 --> 20:12.079
Sorry. You should've gotten
him Spears for Dummies.

20:12.199 --> 20:13.250
He's losing a lot of blood!

20:13.264 --> 20:15.201
I need someone to apply
pressure to his penis!

20:15.228 --> 20:16.037
Come on!

20:16.157 --> 20:18.463
It was nice knowing you, Kevin...
We're gonna divide up your team evenly.

20:18.531 --> 20:19.734
No, no, no!

20:19.854 --> 20:20.536
Come on!

20:20.656 --> 20:21.781
Oh, God.

20:22.049 --> 20:24.398
- You, white knuckler, get in here!
- What?

20:24.518 --> 20:27.010
White knuckle him. Get in here!
Come on!

20:27.130 --> 20:28.467
Put pressure on his penis!

20:28.587 --> 20:29.797
- No!
- Yes!

20:29.917 --> 20:32.107
Are you kidding me?!
This is not happening!

20:32.366 --> 20:34.354
- Squeeze!
- I'm squeezing!

20:34.474 --> 20:35.259
Squeeze!

20:35.897 --> 20:37.679
Don't laugh! It's not funny!

20:37.747 --> 20:38.713
Squeeze harder!

20:38.781 --> 20:39.627
It's feeling better!

20:39.747 --> 20:40.626
Oh, come on!

20:40.746 --> 20:41.950
Oh, that stopped hurting.

20:42.017 --> 20:43.952
It feels good now.
