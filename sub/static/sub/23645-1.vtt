- I'm breaking up with you!

Do you still want
to make a jump?

03:56.269 --> 03:58.670
There's another landing
field up ahead.

03:58.671 --> 04:01.441
Are you crazy? I could die.

04:27.634 --> 04:31.570
Yeah, I'll be there at
6PM sharp like always.

04:31.571 --> 04:37.042
No. Because there's never anybody
I want you to meet, Mom.

04:37.043 --> 04:41.614
Yeah, there still
swimming, last I checked.

04:44.651 --> 04:46.718
All right, I'll see you Sunday.

04:46.719 --> 04:47.887
I love you too, bye-bye.

04:49.922 --> 04:53.592
- Dinner Sunday at Mom's?
- Yeah.

04:53.593 --> 04:57.429
Oh, I'm sorry, man. You want
to come to dinner on Sunday?

04:57.430 --> 04:59.298
Aw thanks, man, I'd love to.

04:59.299 --> 05:02.801
So, what seismic earth shift
got your ass off the couch

05:02.802 --> 05:05.504
and in to my office
today, buddy?

05:05.505 --> 05:07.372
Basketball with the guys.

05:07.373 --> 05:09.841
Oh, yeah.

05:09.842 --> 05:12.511
Man, I can't do it,
I got to work.

05:12.512 --> 05:15.947
-Hoops, bro. -I hear ya, I can't do it.
Look at this.

05:15.948 --> 05:17.683
Oh, oh, who's the
little brunette

05:17.684 --> 05:19.618
with the big guy? What
did he do, kill her?

05:19.619 --> 05:21.553
- An assault.
- He beat her up?

05:21.554 --> 05:24.556
- She kicked his ass, actually.
- Ha! Yeah?

05:24.557 --> 05:28.727
Yeah, so she caught him
having sex with the neighbor.

05:28.728 --> 05:33.332
There was an altercation, and
he's suing her for damages.

05:33.333 --> 05:37.035
So, she hired me to make it all go away.
She still loves the guy.

05:37.036 --> 05:39.104
She wants him back after
he boned the neighbor?

05:39.105 --> 05:41.473
I don't know what
to tell you, man.

05:41.474 --> 05:44.042
Sexual impulses are
strong, but sometimes,

05:44.043 --> 05:46.645
I guess love is stronger.

05:46.646 --> 05:47.879
Is that the Hayworth file?

05:47.880 --> 05:49.414
It sure is.

05:49.415 --> 05:50.949
So, you're handling
the arbitration?

05:50.950 --> 05:52.384
Yeah, I gotcha covered.

05:52.385 --> 05:53.719
You bet, you can head
home to the kids.

05:53.720 --> 05:54.853
Oh!

05:54.854 --> 05:57.422
Whoa, whoa!

05:57.423 --> 06:01.793
Hey, honey. No, the Adderall
is in the green bottle,

06:01.794 --> 06:03.395
it's organic.

06:03.396 --> 06:06.365
Yeah. No, honey, it's
right next to the...

06:06.366 --> 06:09.101
No!

06:09.102 --> 06:11.037
That's liquid gold!

06:13.573 --> 06:15.807
Nope, that's a goner.

06:15.808 --> 06:18.744
Honey, you're going to
have to take some milk

06:18.745 --> 06:20.812
out of the freezer. I
lost the afternoon load.

06:20.813 --> 06:22.415
Sorry.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.854
It's still warm.

06:31.891 --> 06:35.461
I don't care. Calvin, I
need you in my office.

06:54.981 --> 06:57.483
You can close the
door behind you.

07:02.522 --> 07:04.689
You like it here
don't you, Calvin?

07:04.690 --> 07:08.660
Your work has been outstanding.
Partners have noticed.

07:08.661 --> 07:11.196
Yeah. You know, I'm surprised,

07:11.197 --> 07:14.499
but you can actually do good
work in an oversized law firm

07:14.500 --> 07:16.001
with hourly rates
higher than gods.

07:16.002 --> 07:19.871
Hmm. How are the women's
rights cases going?

07:19.872 --> 07:22.741
Mm. Just fine, great.

07:22.742 --> 07:24.109
Still winning?

07:24.110 --> 07:26.478
I'm undefeated. But
you knew that.

07:26.479 --> 07:28.548
Hm. That's good.

07:30.016 --> 07:31.817
It's really good.

07:31.818 --> 07:33.752
Gena, why am I here?

07:33.753 --> 07:37.222
I have a situation
that needs handling,

07:37.223 --> 07:40.659
and I think you are just
the person for the job.

07:40.660 --> 07:42.894
- Client?
- Blogger.

07:42.895 --> 07:46.665
My sister, actually.

07:46.666 --> 07:50.735
Ah-ha. The mysterious
sister you never speak of.

07:50.736 --> 07:53.138
She was only 15
when our dad died.

07:53.139 --> 07:57.776
Just a kid, really.
She was heartbroken.

07:57.777 --> 08:01.947
And then... I went
off to law school...

08:01.948 --> 08:04.583
Well, I'm sure she's fine.

08:04.584 --> 08:07.185
She might look fine
from the outside.

08:07.186 --> 08:10.155
She's a successful scientist
here in Portland, actually.

08:10.156 --> 08:13.758
She writes formulas for
Fortune 500 companies.

08:13.759 --> 08:16.628
- What kind of formulas?
- Various things.

08:16.629 --> 08:20.532
Did you know that there is
a formula for happiness?

08:20.533 --> 08:22.702
Yeah, it's called whiskey.

08:25.938 --> 08:29.074
Anyway, that is all a façade.

08:29.075 --> 08:32.278
The real Lauren is a
different person altogether.

08:34.714 --> 08:36.682
Look at this.

08:40.886 --> 08:42.922
The Pig Theory.

08:44.557 --> 08:48.226
The point of
infidelity and guilt.

08:48.227 --> 08:49.961
Gena, this is kind of awesome.

08:49.962 --> 08:51.997
It's not awesome, it's insane.

08:51.998 --> 08:55.000
Can you imagine the impact she's
having on these people's lives?

08:55.001 --> 08:58.069
Not to mention her own
mental wellbeing.

08:58.070 --> 08:59.804
They're empowering her.

08:59.805 --> 09:04.042
She's been offered a very
lucrative book deal.

09:04.043 --> 09:07.245
And I'm just concerned

09:07.246 --> 09:09.581
that if she writes that book,

09:09.582 --> 09:12.984
the girl I grew up with
will be gone forever.

09:12.985 --> 09:16.221
So, I need you to stop her.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.858
The blog, the book, all of it.

09:19.926 --> 09:21.326
And how exactly

09:21.327 --> 09:22.794
am I supposed to do that?

09:22.795 --> 09:25.230
I don't care how you do it.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.899
Use your powers of persuasion.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.801
You're undefeated, right?

09:29.802 --> 09:31.036
Women love you.

09:31.037 --> 09:32.938
Ah...

09:32.939 --> 09:35.740
You want me to mess with
this poor girl's head?

09:35.741 --> 09:39.711
No, just... take her to drinks,

09:39.712 --> 09:42.581
you know, show her that there
are good guys out there.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.616
Guys like you.

09:47.787 --> 09:50.989
I'm sorry, I... I can't do that.

09:50.990 --> 09:54.993
Mm. I had a feeling
you'd say that.

09:54.994 --> 09:58.797
So, I have an offer for you.

09:58.798 --> 10:01.032
Do this and I will recommend

10:01.033 --> 10:02.801
that you make partner
to the board.

10:02.802 --> 10:04.636
Now that's cold, Gena,

10:04.637 --> 10:06.371
you know I deserve
to make partner.

10:06.372 --> 10:10.108
Yes, you do, and this
will guarantee it.

10:10.109 --> 10:15.280
Tucker, Aaronson,
Mauldin & Chesney.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.116
Has a nice ring to
it, doesn't it?

10:21.387 --> 10:23.322
OK...

10:25.825 --> 10:28.361
OK. I'll talk to her...

10:30.963 --> 10:36.134
and I'll get her to
shut down the blog.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.103
Mm.

10:38.104 --> 10:41.173
I knew you would
see things my way.

11:30.156 --> 11:34.392
No, no, you tell him I will make
that donation to Popular Science

11:34.393 --> 11:36.428
and I don't want any
recognition for it.

11:36.429 --> 11:39.130
People need their science, man.

11:39.131 --> 11:40.331
Oh!

11:40.332 --> 11:42.267
Whoa, whoa!

11:42.268 --> 11:45.837
- Hey, you OK there?
- Yeah.

11:45.838 --> 11:47.973
You mind if I take a look?

11:49.408 --> 11:51.076
Can I have my leg back?

11:51.077 --> 11:54.080
Yeah, sorry.

11:55.147 --> 11:57.116
Here, let me help you up.

12:00.186 --> 12:02.454
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

12:02.455 --> 12:05.423
Listen, that could
be a nasty sprain.

12:05.424 --> 12:07.025
Why don't I get you some ice.

12:07.026 --> 12:08.094
Maybe a cup of coffee?

12:10.296 --> 12:13.398
You know, I don't know you.

12:13.399 --> 12:16.234
I'm sorry, but why would
I get coffee with you?

12:16.235 --> 12:18.370
I'm Calvin.

12:30.483 --> 12:32.284
Thanks.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.020
I'm Lauren, by the way.

12:36.021 --> 12:38.022
Nice to meet you.

12:38.023 --> 12:41.059
What's-what's in
the folder there?

12:41.060 --> 12:43.528
Uh, it's my work.
I'm a scientist,

12:43.529 --> 12:45.830
but mainly I just work
on product improvement.

12:45.831 --> 12:48.433
And it's a report on a
formula I was developing.

12:48.434 --> 12:51.202
Wow, that sounds serious.

12:51.203 --> 12:52.971
Not so much.

12:52.972 --> 12:55.440
It's the formula for, I don't
know, the perfect pizza.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.876
Cheese, crust, and beer.

12:57.877 --> 13:00.111
Basically, right? Yeah.

13:00.112 --> 13:02.514
I mean, there might be a few
more factors at play, but...

13:02.515 --> 13:04.115
Such as?

13:04.116 --> 13:07.519
All right, well, so
the perfect pizza

13:07.520 --> 13:10.455
boils down to that first
perfect bite, you know?

13:10.456 --> 13:12.490
But with these larger pizzas,

13:12.491 --> 13:14.559
sometimes the crust can
get a little soggy,

13:14.560 --> 13:16.261
especially in the middle,

13:16.262 --> 13:19.798
but you can calculate
the perfect ratio

13:19.799 --> 13:21.900
between the thickness
of the pizza's crust

13:21.901 --> 13:24.068
and constant volume of toppings,

13:24.069 --> 13:27.505
then you can formulate
the perfect bite.

13:27.506 --> 13:30.508
Anyway, our client

13:30.509 --> 13:34.312
used the formula to ad nine
grams of dough to their pizza,

13:34.313 --> 13:37.448
and now some say it's
the perfect pizza.

13:37.449 --> 13:39.217
Wow.

13:39.218 --> 13:41.386
Yeah.

13:41.387 --> 13:44.889
Well, you know what
this means, don't you?

13:44.890 --> 13:48.159
Actually, I really don't.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.963
It means that you have
to take me to this place

13:51.964 --> 13:55.334
and we need to experience
this perfect pizza.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.436
I don't know,

13:58.437 --> 14:00.271
I should probably just...

14:00.272 --> 14:02.240
Come on, you have to.

14:02.241 --> 14:04.108
It's the perfect
pizza, it can't wait.

14:04.109 --> 14:06.544
OK, OK, you're kind of
putting me on the spot here,

14:06.545 --> 14:08.279
but all right, let's
try the pizza.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.014
Come on, if you can walk,
you can eat pizza.

14:10.015 --> 14:11.482
I can hobble down the
street a little bit, yeah.

14:11.483 --> 14:14.385
All right, terrific...
perfect pizza.

14:14.386 --> 14:17.288
You can't tell a guy
about a perfect pizza...

14:17.289 --> 14:19.324
Come on... Do you need this?

14:19.325 --> 14:21.392
-Yeah, thank you. -Are you
sure you trust me with this?

14:21.393 --> 14:26.564
Wow, I gotta say, that
was a pretty good pizza.

14:26.565 --> 14:28.299
- Pretty good.
- Pretty good.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.401
I don't know if it's
the perfect pizza...

14:30.402 --> 14:32.103
- Oh, I see.
- Thank you.

14:32.104 --> 14:33.471
But it's pretty good.

14:33.472 --> 14:35.240
I'll give it to you,
it's pretty good.

14:35.241 --> 14:36.474
It's pretty good. OK.

14:36.475 --> 14:37.977
Thank you. I'll
take pretty good.

14:55.027 --> 14:57.062
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

15:01.533 --> 15:03.301
Watch that ankle.

15:03.302 --> 15:05.204
It's OK.

15:06.305 --> 15:09.607
Well, thank you for the ice.

15:09.608 --> 15:13.111
Yeah, thank you for the pizza.

15:13.112 --> 15:16.014
It was great to meet you.

15:16.015 --> 15:18.149
Great meeting you, Lauren.

15:18.150 --> 15:19.351
Goodnight.

15:21.053 --> 15:22.688
Hey, Lauren...

15:24.089 --> 15:26.325
Can I see you again?

15:30.663 --> 15:32.631
Maybe.

15:35.134 --> 15:36.368
That's not a no.

16:07.599 --> 16:09.101
Voodoo?

16:12.404 --> 16:14.539
-Thank you. -You're
welcome, you're welcome.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.975
- That's super sweet.
- It is super sweet.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.476
- It is super sweet.
- Yeah.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.079
- But I do love this place.
- Yeah, one at a time there.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.448
Oh, mmmm.

17:16.801 --> 17:18.368
Thanks.

17:18.369 --> 17:20.438
Yeah, no, I was really
lucky to get this place.

17:20.439 --> 17:24.209
- I moved in two years ago.
- Yeah, it's really nice.

17:26.211 --> 17:29.414
So...

17:29.415 --> 17:33.251
You know, you don't have
to leave right away.

17:33.252 --> 17:38.456
You can... stay the
night if you want.

17:38.457 --> 17:42.693
OK, um...

17:42.694 --> 17:45.263
I'd like that.

17:45.264 --> 17:46.598
But I can't.

17:49.635 --> 17:53.271
Um, but I thought we were...

17:53.272 --> 17:55.540
- I thought we had been...
- We are.

17:55.541 --> 17:57.842
We are.

17:57.843 --> 18:00.845
And, um...

18:00.846 --> 18:04.849
that's why I don't want to
take this to the next level

18:04.850 --> 18:07.485
until we've been totally
honest with each other.

18:07.486 --> 18:09.822
I thought we had been.

18:19.731 --> 18:22.800
I know about your blog,

18:22.801 --> 18:25.637
the, um, Pig Theory?

18:27.539 --> 18:29.408
Everything.

18:31.643 --> 18:34.479
Blog? What...

18:34.480 --> 18:37.115
Gena told me...

18:37.116 --> 18:41.152
She's my boss.

18:41.153 --> 18:44.255
- Did Gena put you up to this?
- No, no.

18:44.256 --> 18:47.325
Nobody put me up to anything.

18:47.326 --> 18:50.795
I, I saw a picture
of you on her desk

18:50.796 --> 18:53.631
and she told me about the blog.

18:53.632 --> 18:56.902
I... I was intrigued.

18:59.238 --> 19:05.276
No. What about all that about
donating to Popular Science magazine.

19:05.277 --> 19:06.811
I mean, you were
outside my office...

19:06.812 --> 19:09.748
Just an excuse to meet you.

19:11.416 --> 19:13.484
I didn't know you were going
to sprain your ankle,

19:13.485 --> 19:17.355
but, um, yeah.

19:17.356 --> 19:19.223
I mean, if you read the blog,

19:19.224 --> 19:21.226
then why you would
want to meet me?

19:23.195 --> 19:25.164
You intrigued me.

19:27.399 --> 19:28.700
You still do.

19:33.405 --> 19:35.273
Hey, come on,

19:35.274 --> 19:39.777
this past week has
been great, right?

19:39.778 --> 19:42.713
So, um...

19:42.714 --> 19:45.450
maybe you show me more.

19:46.685 --> 19:48.654
More of the real you.

19:53.559 --> 19:57.462
OK, you want to see more?

19:59.932 --> 20:02.434
Come up to my office.

20:06.605 --> 20:08.640
OK.

20:20.485 --> 20:24.789
So, as you can see,
the blog is...

20:24.790 --> 20:26.658
kind of a big deal.

20:29.428 --> 20:31.596
Are these all your followers?

20:31.597 --> 20:34.232
I've got just under
two million globally.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.568
I was even thinking about turning
the whole thing into a book.

20:37.569 --> 20:42.840
Wow, it's impressive. It is.

20:42.841 --> 20:46.477
And the blog's good,
too, I've read it.

20:46.478 --> 20:49.347
But you know what
impresses me more?

20:49.348 --> 20:52.617
The fact that you haven't
written anything since we met.

20:52.618 --> 20:56.354
Had a full week, not one post.

20:56.355 --> 20:58.923
It gives a guy a little hope.

20:58.924 --> 21:05.396
You know. Hope that maybe the
Pig Slayer has met someone?

21:05.397 --> 21:09.967
She's ready to turn over a new
leaf and shut all this down?

21:09.968 --> 21:12.838
Shut it down?

21:14.640 --> 21:16.707
What would I tell
all these people?

21:16.708 --> 21:19.610
I mean, I'm sorry,
but some of them,

21:19.611 --> 21:21.646
I've actually changed
their lives.

21:21.647 --> 21:23.914
For example, this one.

21:23.915 --> 21:25.983
"I asked my heart to
please stop breaking.

21:25.984 --> 21:29.687
I prayed to God for a cure.
Then I found the Pig Slayer."

21:29.688 --> 21:32.790
They kind of depend on me.
I can't just shut it down.

21:32.791 --> 21:35.960
Sure, you can. What is that?

21:35.961 --> 21:40.531
That there... B minus
C, what is all that?

21:40.532 --> 21:43.401
That's my infidelity formula.

21:43.402 --> 21:44.769
That's what the
theory is based on.

21:44.770 --> 21:48.372
Your infidelity formula.

21:48.373 --> 21:50.442
- Yeah.
- OK, explain.

21:52.444 --> 21:54.078
OK, OK...

21:54.079 --> 21:57.948
So all of these variables are
assigned a value of 1-10,

21:57.949 --> 21:59.617
10 being the highest,

21:59.618 --> 22:01.485
and you multiply boredom

22:01.486 --> 22:04.055
by the difference between the
excitement of someone new

22:04.056 --> 22:06.424
and the familiarity of comfort,

22:06.425 --> 22:09.527
and you subtract from that
the fear of conflict,

22:09.528 --> 22:11.796
added with the
opportunity to cheat,

22:11.797 --> 22:14.065
and that final value,
if that's 20 or higher,

22:14.066 --> 22:16.600
then that person is gonna cheat.

22:16.601 --> 22:19.403
And as a failsafe,

22:19.404 --> 22:21.972
you break up after six
months of dating.

22:21.973 --> 22:26.345
Statistically speaking it's not
safe to date for longer than that.

22:27.779 --> 22:29.380
And it works?

22:29.381 --> 22:32.751
Well, two million
people agree with me.

22:38.824 --> 22:41.592
It's... getting kind of late.

22:41.593 --> 22:45.397
Um, I should feed
Ripley and go to bed.

22:51.136 --> 22:53.839
How can you be so sure?

22:55.107 --> 22:56.941
I mean, essentially
you are breaking up

22:56.942 --> 22:59.410
with these people
before they cheat.

22:59.411 --> 23:02.646
Before they have the
opportunity to cheat.

23:02.647 --> 23:05.816
Yeah, but what if they
never would have at all?

23:05.817 --> 23:07.952
People cheat.

23:07.953 --> 23:09.620
All they need is the opportunity

23:09.621 --> 23:11.422
and to know they
won't get caught.

23:11.423 --> 23:13.858
- That's your theory?
- Yeah.

23:13.859 --> 23:16.427
Based on a pretty kick-ass
formula, yes, that's my theory.

23:16.428 --> 23:17.628
And you won't be
convinced otherwise?

23:17.629 --> 23:18.963
That's just how it is

23:18.964 --> 23:22.500
-and how it's going to be, forever?
-Yeah.

23:22.501 --> 23:25.436
And what if I offer a way
to prove your theory wrong?

23:25.437 --> 23:27.138
I don't see how you'd
be able to do that.

23:27.139 --> 23:28.873
Now, hold on, you're
a scientist, right?

23:28.874 --> 23:30.174
So, you know that a
theory is nothing more

23:30.175 --> 23:32.042
than a theory until it's proven.

23:32.043 --> 23:36.614
So have you actually
tested this theory?

23:36.615 --> 23:38.816
- How could you test it?
- OK. Well, you said yourself

23:38.817 --> 23:40.618
that everybody scores
a 20 or higher

23:40.619 --> 23:42.019
after six months of
dating, correct?

23:42.020 --> 23:43.988
- Yeah, correct.
- So, all we would need to do

23:43.989 --> 23:46.490
is find a group of people who
have been in a relationship

23:46.491 --> 23:47.925
for longer than six months,

23:47.926 --> 23:50.161
and give them the
opportunity to cheat

23:50.162 --> 23:52.696
without getting caught, right?

23:52.697 --> 23:54.565
I suppose...

23:54.566 --> 23:56.534
Now to keep a close
watch on our subjects,

23:56.535 --> 23:58.636
they would have to be
people close to us.

23:58.637 --> 24:00.204
Like my friends,
or your friends.

24:00.205 --> 24:02.907
Wait, hold on. I
don't understand.

24:02.908 --> 24:04.074
What are you proposing?

24:04.075 --> 24:07.111
I'm suggesting that you and I

24:07.112 --> 24:09.013
have a little competition.

24:09.014 --> 24:10.915
- A competition?
- Mm-hmm.

24:10.916 --> 24:13.551
I pick five of my friends
who've been in a relationship

24:13.552 --> 24:14.952
for longer than six months,

24:14.953 --> 24:17.455
and you pick the enchantresses

24:17.456 --> 24:18.789
who will be their downfall.

24:18.790 --> 24:20.891
You tempt them, you
challenge them,

24:20.892 --> 24:21.959
you do your worst.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.694
You pick a situation

24:23.695 --> 24:25.162
in which you think gives them

24:25.163 --> 24:26.797
the best opportunity to cheat,

24:26.798 --> 24:29.467
and we will see if
they take the bait.

24:29.468 --> 24:32.503
OK? Best three out of five wins.

24:32.504 --> 24:36.474
OK, if three out of
five people cheat,

24:36.475 --> 24:38.175
then you have to post on my blog

24:38.176 --> 24:39.877
and write a forward to the book

24:39.878 --> 24:42.746
about the competition and
how it all went down,

24:42.747 --> 24:44.882
and admit that, yes,
my theory is correct.

24:44.883 --> 24:46.984
OK,

24:46.985 --> 24:49.553
but if three out of five resist,

24:49.554 --> 24:51.722
then you've got to post
admitting you were wrong

24:51.723 --> 24:53.991
about the whole thing, and
you gotta shut it all down.

24:53.992 --> 24:59.730
And you have to agree
to be with me.

24:59.731 --> 25:02.501
Like normal people,
no expiration date.

25:05.036 --> 25:06.904
Mm.

25:06.905 --> 25:09.507
If I win,

25:09.508 --> 25:11.242
I get my six months with you.

25:11.243 --> 25:13.277
Really?

25:13.278 --> 25:15.579
Yeah.

25:15.580 --> 25:19.083
Yeah, if I win, you still
post, admit defeat,

25:19.084 --> 25:23.755
but I get my six months, and
then we end it. Agreed?

25:25.590 --> 25:27.259
Agreed.

25:32.998 --> 25:34.566
Goodnight, Lauren.

25:49.881 --> 25:51.715
You're upset.

25:51.716 --> 25:53.817
- I'm not upset.
- Yes, you are.

25:53.818 --> 25:57.555
Your voice always rises like
three octaves when you're upset.

25:57.556 --> 25:58.889
I'm not upset.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.824
Now you're transgender.

26:00.825 --> 26:03.994
Oh... First of all, how could
you embarrass me like that?

26:03.995 --> 26:05.864
What... You...

26:07.299 --> 26:11.302
You send some guy my
way, who doesn't even...

26:11.303 --> 26:13.571
and why would he...?

26:13.572 --> 26:16.874
First of all, I know
how to find a guy.

26:16.875 --> 26:19.978
Finding them has never been
your problem, sweetie.

26:22.247 --> 26:25.749
I don't have any problems!

26:25.750 --> 26:27.351
You know, I really
thought he liked me.

26:27.352 --> 26:29.086
He does, you idiot, I mean,

26:29.087 --> 26:31.622
why else would he take part in this...
what is it,

26:31.623 --> 26:33.624
like a competition?

26:33.625 --> 26:37.094
Yeah. You're right. Best
three out of five wins.

26:37.095 --> 26:39.163
Oh, I'm so gonna kick his ass.

26:39.164 --> 26:42.666
How exactly is this
going to work?

26:42.667 --> 26:46.370
OK, so, we have a list
of challengers, right?

26:46.371 --> 26:50.307
And all these people have been in
relationships six months or longer,

26:50.308 --> 26:52.910
and to prove my theory correct,

26:52.911 --> 26:57.649
alls I have to do is...
tempt them.

26:59.651 --> 27:01.685
Oh, my God, there's a list.

27:01.686 --> 27:03.220
What do you know
about these people?

27:03.221 --> 27:05.055
Everything I need to know.

27:05.056 --> 27:07.691
Simon Walker, OK, so,
he's a preppy bartender.

27:07.692 --> 27:09.660
The bartender at Toochies?
- Right, exactly.

27:09.661 --> 27:11.228
Apparently, he's one
of Cal's best friends

27:11.229 --> 27:13.998
and he's been engaged
for two years.

27:13.999 --> 27:17.167
Now, Cal says, "Oh, he
wouldn't possibly cheat."

27:17.168 --> 27:18.869
That's a very long engagement.

27:18.870 --> 27:21.705
- Right?
- Who's that?

27:21.706 --> 27:23.707
Edward Hockett.

27:23.708 --> 27:25.009
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:25.010 --> 27:26.377
They're high school sweethearts.

27:26.378 --> 27:28.879
Now we went to a
yoga class together,

27:28.880 --> 27:30.914
and actually,

27:30.915 --> 27:32.916
oh, you know, I hate to
do it to her really,

27:32.917 --> 27:36.153
but, uh, hey, if Cal's right and
my theory is totally wrong,

27:36.154 --> 27:39.089
then, hey, I haven't
done anything, right?

27:39.090 --> 27:42.192
Right. But you're not
going to actually arrange

27:42.193 --> 27:43.761
for these people to
have sex, are you?

27:43.762 --> 27:46.363
No. OK, so,

27:46.364 --> 27:48.165
Cal and I argued
about this, right?

27:48.166 --> 27:49.800
And he came up
with a good point.

27:49.801 --> 27:51.835
He said, "Well, somebody
could always back out,

27:51.836 --> 27:54.104
or change their mind, how
are you gonna know?"

27:54.105 --> 27:57.441
And I said, "Listen, if the
underwear have come out,

27:57.442 --> 28:00.811
it's a done deal," so
we decided on that.

28:00.812 --> 28:02.312
Underwear is proof.

28:02.313 --> 28:05.149
You're going to steal
these people's underwear?

28:05.150 --> 28:07.685
Me? No, no, no. I'm
not gonna do that.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.453
Corina's gonna do it.

28:09.454 --> 28:10.789
Who's Corina?

28:12.323 --> 28:14.758
She's a devout
follower of the blog.

28:14.759 --> 28:17.094
She's got some very interesting
things to say about men.

28:17.095 --> 28:19.163
We have gotten close over
the last couple of years.

28:19.164 --> 28:21.999
She... dances. Exotically.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.703
- [GenShe's a stripper.
- Hey, don't be so judgey.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.905
She's a person. Like you or me.

28:27.906 --> 28:29.473
Thank you.

28:29.474 --> 28:31.275
Thank you...

28:31.276 --> 28:33.377
Anyway, I said she could

28:33.378 --> 28:35.079
post a victory blog when we win.

28:35.080 --> 28:38.415
Mm. When you win?

28:38.416 --> 28:39.850
Mm-hmm.

28:39.851 --> 28:41.919
Look, I'm a little
bit of an expert

28:41.920 --> 28:44.121
in human nature, OK?
I can't lose.

28:44.122 --> 28:47.092
OK, but what if you do?

28:49.094 --> 28:52.896
Well, if I do, I have
to admit defeat.

28:52.897 --> 28:55.065
I have to shut down the blog,

28:55.066 --> 28:57.067
which means I lose my followers.

28:57.068 --> 28:58.402
Then I have to
postpone the book,

28:58.403 --> 29:00.437
because without a blog
there is no book.

29:00.438 --> 29:03.907
That's a lot of think about.
You must really like him

29:03.908 --> 29:05.510
if you're willing
to risk so much.

29:08.079 --> 29:10.514
I don't know, I'm going to win.

29:10.515 --> 29:12.149
Also think about it this way.

29:12.150 --> 29:14.151
If I get the city's top
female advocate attorney

29:14.152 --> 29:17.521
writing on my blog about the
competition and what it proves?

29:17.522 --> 29:20.424
That book, that book
is worth the mint.

29:20.425 --> 29:23.494
Wait, Sharon Gottlieb she
works in our office.

29:23.495 --> 29:26.063
She is happily married,
just had a baby.

29:26.064 --> 29:28.799
Corina is definitely
not her type.

29:28.800 --> 29:32.302
Yeah, no, I know. He threw that in there.
But, you know what? It's fine.

29:32.303 --> 29:34.505
The pig theory applies
to men and women alike.

29:34.506 --> 29:37.274
We all can be pigs.
That's the whole point.

29:37.275 --> 29:40.043
I mean, you and Mom were
a huge inspiration.

29:40.044 --> 29:41.845
Gee, thanks.

29:41.846 --> 29:44.047
So, how are you going
to tempt Sharon?

29:44.048 --> 29:47.151
There's a male dancer that
works at the Caritas Club.

29:47.152 --> 29:50.254
- Oh...
- He's down to play.

29:50.255 --> 29:52.923
And, God, he's really hot.

29:52.924 --> 29:55.058
Poor Sharon doesn't
stand a chance.

29:55.059 --> 29:58.295
OK. And, uh, these
last two challengers?

29:58.296 --> 30:00.497
Oh right, Garrett Stuckey.

30:00.498 --> 30:04.902
Yeah, that's, um, that's
Cal's fitness instructor.

30:04.903 --> 30:09.506
You know, he's one of these
thick, veiny-neck kind of guys.

30:09.507 --> 30:12.910
He's been living with the aerobics
instructor for two years.

30:12.911 --> 30:14.244
That seems like an easy one.

30:14.245 --> 30:16.346
Yeah. That's exactly
what I think.

30:16.347 --> 30:18.482
But, I don't know, Cal swears

30:18.483 --> 30:22.219
he's a man of
integrity and honor.

30:22.220 --> 30:24.955
No, he doesn't actually
talk like that.

30:24.956 --> 30:26.957
I swear, he does.

30:26.958 --> 30:28.492
I don't know, maybe the
competition brought out

30:28.493 --> 30:31.395
a whole new Prince
Charming thing.

30:31.396 --> 30:34.531
That's precious.

30:34.532 --> 30:38.535
Gena, I've been
meaning to ask you.

30:38.536 --> 30:41.438
So, you guys went to
law school together,

30:41.439 --> 30:43.073
you work with him,

30:43.074 --> 30:45.209
you've known him a
long time, he's a guy,

30:45.210 --> 30:47.111
and you're... you.

30:49.347 --> 30:52.115
You guys never slept
together or anything, right?

30:52.116 --> 30:53.584
Of course not!

30:53.585 --> 30:55.185
'Cause that would be gross.

30:55.186 --> 30:58.956
Yes, that would.

30:58.957 --> 31:00.524
Now who is this last challenger?

31:00.525 --> 31:02.526
Yeah.

31:02.527 --> 31:04.528
That's his minister.
Married guy.

31:04.529 --> 31:07.130
Minister? That hardly seem fair.

31:07.131 --> 31:09.600
I thought that at first
too, but, I don't know,

31:09.601 --> 31:11.168
he's a Presbyterian minister,

31:11.169 --> 31:13.170
so he never took the
oath of celibacy,

31:13.171 --> 31:17.307
and I do say that, you know, the
theory applies to everyone,

31:17.308 --> 31:18.609
so, it is fair.

31:18.610 --> 31:21.412
Still, that seems like
kind of a long shot.

31:23.381 --> 31:25.283
Does it, though?

31:28.286 --> 31:32.422
OK but, how can you be
sure he's not going to

31:32.423 --> 31:36.027
tell all of his friends before
just so that he can win?

31:37.662 --> 31:42.199
Uh, yeah, that's a good point.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.167
Well, I guess we'll just
have to hope that he's

31:44.168 --> 31:46.671
a man of integrity and honor.

32:04.322 --> 32:06.057
Good evening.

32:09.994 --> 32:11.996
Well, it's just a
temporary shutdown.

32:14.032 --> 32:15.999
Can't be writing on the blog

32:16.000 --> 32:18.568
in the middle of
the competition.

32:18.569 --> 32:20.270
Don't want to ruin the secret.

32:20.271 --> 32:22.573
Right, Ripley?

32:23.574 --> 32:26.210
OK...

32:51.736 --> 32:55.540
And... I raise you two dollars.

32:57.108 --> 32:58.475
You are so bluffing.

32:58.476 --> 33:00.744
Kwan, you're not
even in the hand.

33:00.745 --> 33:04.448
It's a Tae Kwon Do trick. I can read
your body, therefore, your mind.

33:04.449 --> 33:07.651
You took Taw Kwon Do
in the third grade.

33:07.652 --> 33:09.519
It never leaves you.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.154
- Oh, my God, Kwan.
- Hey man,

33:11.155 --> 33:13.457
my people have suffered a lot.

33:13.458 --> 33:16.660
Did you know in some places you're
only allowed to have one kid?

33:16.661 --> 33:19.663
Yeah, but you're hungry again an
hour later, all right, let's go.

33:19.664 --> 33:22.466
Boo-yah! King high straight.

33:22.467 --> 33:24.034
OK...

33:24.035 --> 33:26.670
Now, don't feel too bad.
I got the brains.

33:26.671 --> 33:28.740
But you, you got the...

33:30.208 --> 33:31.509
I got the looks too.

33:35.480 --> 33:38.281
Didn't even see the flush.

33:38.282 --> 33:39.716
- No!
- Oooh!

33:39.717 --> 33:41.018
Thank you. Thank you.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.319
My doctor says take two of these

33:42.320 --> 33:45.155
and call him in the morning.

33:45.156 --> 33:48.191
Cal, tell the guys about
your new girlfriend.

33:48.192 --> 33:51.461
The hikes, the long
walks in the park.

33:51.462 --> 33:55.165
Yeah, guys, she's, uh,
yeah, she's pretty great.

33:55.166 --> 33:58.635
Does she work out, bro? I mean, 'cause you
want to keep that ass high and tight,

33:58.636 --> 34:01.204
'cause later she's going to
give up and it's going to sag.

34:01.205 --> 34:03.407
She looks like she works out.

34:03.408 --> 34:05.542
How about we hear about
what she's like?

34:05.543 --> 34:11.648
Well, she's, uh, cool,
and smart and quirky.

34:11.649 --> 34:13.483
A little bit crazy.

34:13.484 --> 34:15.085
Hey, is she a red head?

34:15.085 --> 34:16.585
Come on.

34:16.587 --> 34:20.623
Man, Kimberly has been coming
to bed lately in flannels.

34:20.625 --> 34:22.225
It's a clear message.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.561
- Black women do
not wear flannel.

34:24.562 --> 34:27.130
I'm still being punished from
the last time we went fishing.

34:27.130 --> 34:28.632
You should rub her feet.

34:28.632 --> 34:30.199
What?

34:30.201 --> 34:31.435
I'm telling you,

34:31.436 --> 34:34.337
Jenny loves it when
I rub her feet.

34:34.338 --> 34:37.741
And then I run her calves,
and then I rub her knees.

34:37.742 --> 34:40.110
- Dude!
- We get it! Thank you.

34:40.110 --> 34:43.280
So what kind of crazy is she?

34:43.281 --> 34:47.350
Yeah, like, Angelina Jolie
crazy or Tilda Swinton crazy?

34:47.351 --> 34:49.587
Who the hell is Tilda Swinton?

34:50.755 --> 34:53.123
Nah, I'd say she's probably

34:53.123 --> 34:54.658
the Tilda crazy,

34:54.659 --> 34:56.460
but she's got a lot
of sweetness too.

34:56.460 --> 34:59.396
I'm telling you, this uh,
this girl's a good one.

34:59.397 --> 35:02.232
Well, be nice to her.
I like this one.

35:02.233 --> 35:05.735
Oh, thank you, doctor,
I plan on it.

35:05.736 --> 35:09.339
Hey, guys. Who the
hell is Tilda Swinton?

35:09.340 --> 35:12.476
Jesus, Garrett. Go to a movie.
Go see a movie!

35:12.477 --> 35:13.677
You too busy?

35:13.678 --> 35:17.247
"I'm poundin' weights! Uhh!"

35:17.248 --> 35:20.450
Protein, reps.

35:20.451 --> 35:23.888
Ante up, douche.

35:31.829 --> 35:36.133
Just got off the phone with
Mom, she's pulling up now.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.535
You know, I don't see
what the big deal is.

35:38.536 --> 35:40.770
I mean, she's been
dating since Dad died.

35:40.771 --> 35:43.206
Aren't you even a
little but curious?

35:43.207 --> 35:45.275
- No.
- What if he's the one?

35:45.276 --> 35:47.245
Gena, she already met the one.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.715
Hello, my darlings.

35:51.716 --> 35:53.917
I'm so sorry to
keep you waiting.

35:53.918 --> 35:55.519
Alejandro is parking the car.

35:55.520 --> 35:56.786
Hi, Mom.

35:56.787 --> 35:58.522
Hey, Mom, how have you been?

35:58.523 --> 36:01.691
I love your new... look.

36:01.692 --> 36:04.594
Mama Mia, Bellissimo!

36:04.595 --> 36:07.865
- It's Valentino.
- Giorgio Armani.

36:09.233 --> 36:13.337
BonjournMy darling.

36:16.574 --> 36:18.808
- Oh!
- Sweet.

36:18.809 --> 36:22.279
Guys, this is Alejandro Baraza.

36:22.280 --> 36:26.516
This is my daughter, Gena, and
my other daughter, Lauren.

36:26.517 --> 36:29.687
Like dulcet dewdrops
dripped from a diamond.

36:30.688 --> 36:32.189
I love it...

36:32.190 --> 36:33.658
- I love it!
- Oh, well!

36:35.660 --> 36:39.529
Oh! Oh. I'm so sorry!

36:39.530 --> 36:42.399
I just must be a...

36:42.400 --> 36:44.868
drippy, drippy dewdrop.

36:44.869 --> 36:46.937
It's OK, it's OK...

36:46.938 --> 36:48.505
- Let's eat.
- Hmmm.

36:48.506 --> 36:50.373
- Right this way.
- Thank you.

36:50.374 --> 36:51.975
So, they tell you in class

36:51.976 --> 36:53.843
you have to switch
partners every week

36:53.844 --> 36:56.213
so you can experience
different types of dancers.

36:56.214 --> 36:59.349
Alejandro refused to switch.

36:59.350 --> 37:01.318
- Of course.
- Alejandro,

37:01.319 --> 37:03.220
if you don't mind me asking,

37:03.221 --> 37:07.591
what was a gentleman who's
you know, your age,

37:07.592 --> 37:11.595
doing at a senior
ballroom dance class?

37:11.596 --> 37:15.632
I understand your curiosity,
and I will tell you right now.

37:15.633 --> 37:18.735
I work like a dog in my shop.

37:18.736 --> 37:21.238
He's a designer. He
makes men's suites.

37:21.239 --> 37:22.939
- Has his own label.
- Yeah.

37:22.940 --> 37:26.743
-Wow. -So, I was thinking
to myself and I say,

37:26.744 --> 37:30.547
"Alejandro, you're
such a great dancer,

37:30.548 --> 37:33.016
and your heart is
only half full.

37:33.017 --> 37:35.585
This is not the right
way to live the life.

37:35.586 --> 37:40.457
You must live the life with the
heart full of love, always, right?"

37:40.458 --> 37:45.295
So, I walked into the
class, and I was ready

37:45.296 --> 37:47.564
with the shaking of my hulo,

37:47.565 --> 37:50.634
and sharing the
love for the dance,

37:50.635 --> 37:54.838
and there she was, like a
beautiful ball of sunshine,

37:54.839 --> 37:57.340
burning my poor eyes.

37:57.341 --> 37:59.043
Amore mio.

38:02.513 --> 38:04.781
Act your age.

38:04.782 --> 38:07.917
And what does that mean?
"Act my age?"

38:07.918 --> 38:11.588
Am I supposed to be at home knitting
sweaters? Does Gena act her age?

38:11.589 --> 38:13.790
Or what about you, Lauren?
You're 30 years old.

38:13.791 --> 38:15.558
Aren't you supposed
to be married by now

38:15.559 --> 38:16.993
and giving me grandbabies?

38:16.994 --> 38:18.028
I don't see that happening.

38:18.029 --> 38:20.330
I'm very busy, all right?

38:20.331 --> 38:22.799
Work is always crazy,
then there's my blog,

38:22.800 --> 38:24.434
and now this book thing...

38:24.435 --> 38:26.903
Well, we can't all be
Pig Slayers, Lauren.

38:26.904 --> 38:29.673
How long's that been going on, anyway?
And when's that going to stop?

38:29.674 --> 38:33.677
-I'm sure it's just a phase. -At some
point the phase becomes a reality.

38:33.678 --> 38:36.446
And the long-ago sanity
becomes a phase.

38:36.447 --> 38:39.382
I mean, really, none
of us Walden women

38:39.383 --> 38:42.786
are exactly traditionalists,
but you've taken this too far.

38:42.787 --> 38:47.524
Mom, I'm sorry, but I just don't
understand where you're coming from.

38:47.525 --> 38:49.459
I'm just standing up
for what I believe in.

38:49.460 --> 38:53.330
You're not standing for
anything, you're running.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.098
You're not letting anybody in.

38:55.099 --> 38:58.835
Actually, she has met someone.

38:58.836 --> 39:00.337
Really?

39:00.338 --> 39:03.039
Yes! His name is Calvin Chesney,

39:03.040 --> 39:07.877
he is a lawyer at my firm, and
they like each other a lot.

39:07.878 --> 39:10.747
Thank God for that!

39:10.748 --> 39:14.084
- When can I meet him?
- Uh, well, you can't.

39:14.085 --> 39:17.687
- Why not?
- Yeah, why not?

39:17.688 --> 39:20.824
It would be so fun if you brought
Calvin around to meet the family.

39:20.825 --> 39:22.859
I mean, you and Mom could
go on a double date.

39:22.860 --> 39:25.695
Yes, yes.

39:25.696 --> 39:28.665
You should always
believe in your life

39:28.666 --> 39:30.568
with the heart full of love.

39:31.869 --> 39:33.570
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

39:33.571 --> 39:35.071
You mentioned that.

39:35.072 --> 39:37.974
I... In that vein,

39:37.975 --> 39:42.780
I'm actually gonna head out
and go see Calvin right now.

39:43.948 --> 39:45.682
Nice meeting you,

39:45.683 --> 39:50.688
and Mom, it's always good to...
see you.

40:03.501 --> 40:06.069
- What is this?
- Is it me?

40:06.070 --> 40:09.005
Not at all!

40:09.006 --> 40:12.776
It's Gena's. She loaned
it to me for the day.

40:12.777 --> 40:14.644
Thought you might like a ride.

40:14.645 --> 40:16.479
Did she now?

40:16.480 --> 40:18.481
Well, come on, get in,
let's drive this puppy!

40:18.482 --> 40:21.552
- OK, but I'm driving back.
- Oh...

40:28.526 --> 40:31.562
- Ready?
- Ready. Let's go.

41:07.097 --> 41:11.568
And I... got your Queen.

41:11.569 --> 41:15.038
- What? Oh, no!
- Yeah.

41:15.039 --> 41:17.074
Damn.

41:22.046 --> 41:23.646
Checkmate!

41:23.647 --> 41:26.616
Yeah, you set me up
there, didn't you?

41:26.617 --> 41:28.885
- Just a little.
- A little.

41:28.886 --> 41:31.589
All right. You win.

41:44.268 --> 41:46.135
Whoa! Sorry to interrupt.

41:46.136 --> 41:48.905
That's just gross.

41:48.906 --> 41:50.741
Then again, kind of not sorry.

41:52.009 --> 41:53.710
Why don't they find a room?

41:53.711 --> 41:56.880
It's his house.

41:56.881 --> 42:00.216
What a clown.

42:00.217 --> 42:03.586
Yeah, ass clown.

42:03.587 --> 42:07.056
- He's weird.
- Ah, he's harmless.

42:07.057 --> 42:09.192
Why does he live here, though?

42:09.193 --> 42:12.762
I mean, you could afford
this place on your own.

42:12.763 --> 42:14.998
You think?

42:14.999 --> 42:16.966
Nah, I know I could.

42:16.967 --> 42:19.602
Just... That's Jake,

42:19.603 --> 42:22.005
you know, he's always
been there for me.

42:22.006 --> 42:26.175
We've been friends since grade
school and then basketball,

42:26.176 --> 42:28.878
I was point guard and
he was right wing,

42:28.879 --> 42:31.881
all the way through law school
he was always there for me.

42:31.882 --> 42:36.219
Quiz me before exams, take
me out for beers afterwards.

42:36.220 --> 42:39.923
- Even if I always paid.
- I'm sure you did.

42:39.924 --> 42:43.860
Yeah, just... he's
my best friend.

42:43.861 --> 42:46.963
Seems natural to
have him around.

42:46.964 --> 42:50.934
At least until I
find somebody else

42:50.935 --> 42:54.638
to share this place with.

42:58.309 --> 43:00.977
How about you, huh?

43:00.978 --> 43:03.613
Lone wolf.

43:03.614 --> 43:05.315
You like living alone?

43:05.316 --> 43:06.849
I'm not alone.

43:06.850 --> 43:09.752
I have Ripley... and
two million followers.

43:09.753 --> 43:14.023
That's right. I
forgot about that.

43:14.024 --> 43:17.126
Gosh, where do they all sleep?

43:17.127 --> 43:18.828
Ahh, I keep them in the garage.

43:18.829 --> 43:22.098
Yeah...

43:22.099 --> 43:24.702
Oh, man.

43:27.338 --> 43:29.907
I really like this.

43:31.041 --> 43:32.343
Me and you.

43:36.046 --> 43:37.114
Me too.

43:38.916 --> 43:40.883
Yeah?

43:40.884 --> 43:42.252
Yeah.

44:05.876 --> 44:07.777
I should get to work.

44:07.778 --> 44:09.912
I know...

44:09.913 --> 44:12.181
people need their science.

44:12.182 --> 44:15.319
Yes, they do.

44:33.237 --> 44:36.105
Hey, so when do we get started?

44:36.106 --> 44:39.176
- With our competition?
- Yeah.

44:41.245 --> 44:42.879
Now.

44:42.880 --> 44:44.748
Right now?

44:46.116 --> 44:47.851
Yep.

44:48.986 --> 44:51.454
As of now it can
happen at any time

44:51.455 --> 44:55.324
to anyone on your list.

44:55.325 --> 44:57.894
You know, I still don't
think it's fair.

44:57.895 --> 44:59.896
I mean, you know, who
all my friends are

44:59.897 --> 45:02.365
and I have no idea who
you're challenging with.

45:02.366 --> 45:03.801
Oh, you'll know.

45:07.438 --> 45:09.138
See you soon.

45:09.139 --> 45:12.076
How will I know?

45:31.061 --> 45:32.895
Nice car.

45:32.896 --> 45:34.464
[GenYou liked that, did you?

45:34.465 --> 45:36.799
That's one of the perks
of becoming partner.

45:36.800 --> 45:38.801
Yeah, about that.

45:38.802 --> 45:40.169
I've been thinking,

45:40.170 --> 45:41.971
I can't accept the
partnership position

45:41.972 --> 45:44.173
if it has anything
to do with Lauren.

45:44.174 --> 45:45.808
Really.

45:45.809 --> 45:48.444
Yeah, I want to be partner,

45:48.445 --> 45:50.446
and I sure did like
driving that car,

45:50.447 --> 45:54.383
but I don't want you
suggesting me to the board

45:54.384 --> 45:56.819
for any another other reason
than I'm a great lawyer.

45:56.820 --> 45:59.322
Let's just see how
things play out.

45:59.323 --> 46:03.192
From what I can see, everything
is going according to plan.

46:03.193 --> 46:06.229
OK, Gena, but so we're clear,

46:06.230 --> 46:09.766
I'm not doing this
anymore to make partner.

46:09.767 --> 46:12.969
I'm doing this because
I like Lauren.

46:12.970 --> 46:15.038
Bye, Calvin.

46:30.020 --> 46:31.988
How long have you and
Treasure been together?

46:31.989 --> 46:34.490
I don't know, man, about
two years, I guess?

46:34.491 --> 46:37.393
- You gonna get married?
- I don't know, man.

46:37.394 --> 46:39.228
You know, work's been really
good and people been throwing

46:39.229 --> 46:41.164
an ass ton of money at me
just to get into shape,

46:41.165 --> 46:44.233
so we could afford
it if we needed to.

46:44.234 --> 46:47.804
No, I mean, you love her, right?
You want to marry her.

46:47.805 --> 46:49.172
I, I don't know, man.

46:49.173 --> 46:50.840
I mean, I guess
I'm gonna have to

46:50.841 --> 46:53.876
if I want to keep her.
That's how it works, right?

46:53.877 --> 46:55.278
Why are you busting
my balls, man?

46:55.279 --> 46:57.146
Did Treasure put you up to this?

46:57.147 --> 46:59.982
No, no, no, I was just
curious, that's all.

46:59.983 --> 47:01.317
You guys seem happy.

47:01.318 --> 47:03.887
Don't be a douche.

47:13.931 --> 47:16.566
And so it begins.

47:16.567 --> 47:19.135
- Hi.
- Hello.

47:19.136 --> 47:23.005
- Are you Garrett?
- I am. What can I do for you?

47:23.006 --> 47:25.074
Well, I'm looking for a trainer

47:25.075 --> 47:28.211
and the lady at the front
desk, she referred me to you.

47:28.212 --> 47:30.479
OK, so what kind of hours
are you looking for?

47:30.480 --> 47:32.515
Oh, nothing here.

47:32.516 --> 47:35.518
I actually just bought this
really expensive home equipment

47:35.519 --> 47:38.020
and I have no idea
how to use it.

47:38.021 --> 47:41.557
- Sounds dumb, huh?
Actually, no, not at all.

47:41.558 --> 47:44.126
You know, most people don't get
the full benefit of their workout

47:44.127 --> 47:46.162
because they don't know how to
use the equipment correctly.

47:46.163 --> 47:48.364
Sometimes they hurt themselves
or they hurt other people.

47:48.365 --> 47:50.466
- Really?
- That's a fact.

47:50.467 --> 47:53.002
You know, why don't I
give you a free lesson?

47:53.003 --> 47:54.603
Come over here and
show me how you bench.

47:56.907 --> 47:59.009
Yeah...

48:05.349 --> 48:07.550
All right, why don't you
go ahead, and tight back,

48:07.551 --> 48:09.452
stick your chest up,
all right, good.

48:09.453 --> 48:10.987
Grab the bar...

48:10.988 --> 48:14.190
Now go ahead and lift up.

48:14.191 --> 48:17.159
There you go, down and back up.

48:17.160 --> 48:20.162
Oh that's great. Chest
out, there ya go.

48:20.163 --> 48:22.565
Tight back, bring it up, good.

48:22.566 --> 48:25.134
All right. Chest
out a little more.

48:25.135 --> 48:28.104
Oh, that's great. Up. Perfect.

48:28.105 --> 48:30.040
I can work with that.

48:31.041 --> 48:32.910
That is great.

48:37.514 --> 48:40.049
She wants you to go to
her place to show her

48:40.050 --> 48:43.386
how to use gym equipment,
and you're buying that?

48:43.387 --> 48:45.588
Seriously, Cal,

48:45.589 --> 48:48.057
come on, man, you know
I'm a professional.

48:48.058 --> 48:50.159
This is what I do for
a living, all right?

48:50.160 --> 48:52.995
I help clients at their houses
all the time. It's what I do.

48:52.996 --> 48:55.631
You need to get your damn
mind out of the gutter.

48:55.632 --> 48:57.634
Douche.

49:00.037 --> 49:01.204
Wow.

49:16.453 --> 49:18.321
Oh hey, man.

49:18.322 --> 49:19.622
Sign here.

49:19.623 --> 49:21.058
Thanks.

49:26.163 --> 49:28.298
Have a good day.

49:47.417 --> 49:49.219
Garrett.

49:58.228 --> 50:00.196
They're going to be sending
a gaggle of attorneys.

50:00.197 --> 50:02.064
It's an important case, they
don't want to screw it up,

50:02.065 --> 50:03.699
so expect a big presence.

50:03.700 --> 50:06.369
Do you really think "gaggle"
is the best collective term

50:06.370 --> 50:08.170
to use for a group of attorneys?

50:08.171 --> 50:10.706
I'd think it'd be something
more sinister like "murder."

50:10.707 --> 50:12.675
No, no, the crows have that one.

50:12.676 --> 50:15.044
- Do they? Crows.
- Mm-hmm.

50:15.045 --> 50:16.779
What about "onslaught"?

50:16.780 --> 50:18.681
Onslaught! Ah, yes.

50:18.682 --> 50:20.750
Kids... focus! OK.

50:20.751 --> 50:23.686
Uh, you are going to be staying
at the Seattle Weston,

50:23.687 --> 50:26.322
get in Thursday night,
depo is in the morning.

50:26.323 --> 50:27.390
OK, but when do we get back?

50:27.391 --> 50:28.524
Paul's got plenty of milk,

50:28.525 --> 50:29.759
but Maddy's got a soccer game

50:29.760 --> 50:31.660
this weekend and she
is gonna lose her mind

50:31.661 --> 50:34.230
- if I'm not there.
- It's not a problem.

50:34.231 --> 50:35.798
You'll be back Friday night.

50:35.799 --> 50:39.235
I want you to be prepared but
don't over-work yourselves.

50:39.236 --> 50:42.738
Take some personal time
Thursday night, grab a drink.

50:42.739 --> 50:47.511
I doubt we'll have time for that kind
of thing, but dinner might be nice.

50:49.513 --> 50:52.248
Dinner, drinks,

50:52.249 --> 50:55.452
on Thursday... OK.

51:04.561 --> 51:09.698
So, that's 32.50 each
plus 6.25 for your beer

51:09.699 --> 51:11.634
and we can split the tip?

51:11.635 --> 51:13.402
What do you say, six each?

51:13.403 --> 51:15.604
Sounds good. Thank you.

51:15.605 --> 51:18.474
Very precise, this whole thing.

51:18.475 --> 51:20.242
You know, I never
thought I'd say this,

51:20.243 --> 51:23.412
but I actually look forward
to these business trips.

51:23.413 --> 51:26.482
The crappy bar food,
the cheap wine,

51:26.483 --> 51:30.286
and this... silence.

51:30.287 --> 51:33.255
Ah, come on, you've
got the perfect life,

51:33.256 --> 51:35.224
you've got two great
kids, happy marriage.

51:35.225 --> 51:36.292
I wish I had that.

51:36.293 --> 51:37.660
No, you don't.

51:37.661 --> 51:38.727
What are you talking about?

51:38.728 --> 51:39.829
It always looks
like you and Paul

51:39.830 --> 51:40.830
are having such a great time.

51:40.831 --> 51:43.632
That's Facebook, Calvin.

51:43.633 --> 51:45.434
It isn't real.

51:45.435 --> 51:47.137
My children are monsters.

51:49.439 --> 51:51.340
We used to have fun though,

51:51.341 --> 51:52.875
back when we had sex.

51:52.876 --> 51:57.247
God, we used to have great sex!

51:58.615 --> 52:00.549
But you can't have sex
with a baby on your tit.

52:00.550 --> 52:03.586
No, I imagine you can't.

52:03.587 --> 52:05.421
Physically, it's
practically impossible.

52:05.422 --> 52:07.156
It gets in the way.

52:07.157 --> 52:08.824
Unless you hold it
off to the side

52:08.825 --> 52:10.192
which you can practically do

52:10.193 --> 52:12.695
because your boobs
get really long!

52:12.696 --> 52:14.330
And there's the term.

52:14.331 --> 52:15.698
And your vagina is
never the same.

52:15.699 --> 52:18.134
When they say you can
push a bowling ball

52:18.135 --> 52:21.203
through there they're not kidding,
because it gets ginormous!

52:21.204 --> 52:23.706
And there's stuff
flying out of there,

52:23.707 --> 52:25.708
stuff you've never seen before.

52:25.709 --> 52:28.277
Some people keep it,
some people eat it!

52:28.278 --> 52:31.881
OK! You want to order
some coffee here?

52:31.882 --> 52:33.382
Kegels, Please!

52:33.383 --> 52:35.718
I can hardly hold my own pee in!

52:35.719 --> 52:37.887
My vagina is dead.

52:37.888 --> 52:39.555
I have a dead vagina.

52:39.556 --> 52:42.324
That's a lot of talk
about your vagina here.

52:42.325 --> 52:44.293
Ease up, Calvin.

52:44.294 --> 52:46.795
Your mother's vagina went
through the exact same thing.

52:46.796 --> 52:48.931
Not something I care
to discuss either.

52:48.932 --> 52:51.835
God! These are going to burst.

52:54.271 --> 52:57.473
Sorry! Yeah, that one
got away from me.

52:57.474 --> 52:59.508
I better pull the plug.

52:59.509 --> 53:01.944
Yeah.

53:01.945 --> 53:05.314
♪ Words can't say what
you're doing to me ♪

53:05.315 --> 53:08.918
♪ Give me just a minute,
try to understand ♪

53:08.919 --> 53:12.588
♪ I can't control the
shake in my hands ♪

53:12.589 --> 53:16.192
Calvin, you'll never guess
who I bumped into...

53:16.193 --> 53:17.693
This is Brandon.

53:17.694 --> 53:20.729
Coxx. Dr. Coxx.

53:20.730 --> 53:23.599
Dr. Coxx noticed my breast pump

53:23.600 --> 53:26.569
and we got to talking, and it
turns out he's a specialist.

53:26.570 --> 53:30.573
He helps women recover who
have had multiple births.

53:30.574 --> 53:32.509
Ooh! Have a seat!

53:37.214 --> 53:40.316
So, Dr. Coxx,

53:40.317 --> 53:42.718
what are you, like,
a plastic surgeon?

53:42.719 --> 53:44.820
Nothing quite so drastic.

53:44.821 --> 53:47.223
I work with the
body and the mind.

53:47.224 --> 53:49.625
I help women to rediscover
their inner selves

53:49.626 --> 53:51.927
so they can get in
tune with their bodies

53:51.928 --> 53:54.463
and re-awaken their
sexual being.

53:54.464 --> 53:57.466
How does it work? Can you do me?
Can you fix me?

53:57.467 --> 54:00.002
It's a series of meditations
to relax the mind

54:00.003 --> 54:02.805
and intimate massage
techniques to relax the body.

54:02.806 --> 54:06.275
It gets the blood flowing again
in all the right places.

54:06.276 --> 54:09.012
Brings everything back to life.

54:10.647 --> 54:14.016
So, doctor, you
seem pretty young.

54:14.017 --> 54:15.317
How old are you?

54:15.318 --> 54:16.885
It's true, I'm young.

54:16.886 --> 54:19.688
I graduated college
when I was 16,

54:19.689 --> 54:21.790
and completed my medical
training overseas.

54:21.791 --> 54:23.559
Europe is where it's at.

54:23.560 --> 54:26.662
Sex is celebrated
there at every age.

54:26.663 --> 54:28.564
We Americans have it all wrong.

54:28.565 --> 54:29.732
I'm trying to change that.

54:29.733 --> 54:31.800
A savior of sorts.

54:31.801 --> 54:33.536
Yeah.

54:35.338 --> 54:36.972
I'm sorry I'm staring.

54:36.973 --> 54:40.009
It's just that you have
the most beautiful eyes.

54:40.010 --> 54:41.710
I do?

54:41.711 --> 54:43.780
It's just...

54:48.351 --> 54:50.387
Do you mind?

54:55.592 --> 54:58.560
Yes. There she is.

54:58.561 --> 55:02.464
You definitely have the vibrant
sexual being in there.

55:02.465 --> 55:03.533
I could help you find it.

55:04.934 --> 55:08.470
OK... This is great stuff,

55:08.471 --> 55:10.806
but, uh, Sharon,
it's getting late.

55:10.807 --> 55:12.574
We've got that early meeting.

55:12.575 --> 55:14.743
We should probably get
your card and head up.

55:14.744 --> 55:17.012
-We've got an early day tomorrow.
-Calvin!

55:17.013 --> 55:19.581
We're work colleagues, no!

55:19.582 --> 55:21.383
Why don't we order
some more drinks

55:21.384 --> 55:24.086
and talk about this some more?
I think it's fascinating!

55:24.087 --> 55:27.356
Yeah!

55:27.357 --> 55:29.725
Fascinating!

55:29.726 --> 55:32.961
The mistake that people make with
their lovers is forcefulness.

55:32.962 --> 55:35.631
You have to approach
these areas tenderly.

55:35.632 --> 55:38.901
You have to gently coax

55:38.902 --> 55:40.903
and gently coax some more

55:40.904 --> 55:43.472
so that the body reaches for it,

55:43.473 --> 55:45.375
desires the touch.

55:46.476 --> 55:49.446
God, that makes so much sense!

55:51.748 --> 55:54.350
Uhh, wow.

55:54.351 --> 55:58.020
Sharon, look at the time,
we should probably go!

55:58.021 --> 55:59.588
Yeah, we should.

55:59.589 --> 56:01.557
Can I walk you?

56:01.558 --> 56:03.892
No, no. There's no
need, I'll walk her.

56:03.893 --> 56:05.594
Sharon, is this your key card?

56:05.595 --> 56:08.497
Actually, a walk would be nice.

56:08.498 --> 56:09.665
Thank you, Dr. Coxx.

56:09.666 --> 56:11.533
But we have that meeting...

56:11.534 --> 56:12.768
in the morning.

56:12.769 --> 56:15.537
Surely there's no
time for a walk.

56:15.538 --> 56:18.640
Calvin, I'm a grown woman.

56:18.641 --> 56:22.145
I know when I need a walk.

56:23.580 --> 56:25.647
- Shall we?
- Of course.

56:25.648 --> 56:27.450
Grab my jacket.

56:31.588 --> 56:35.992
Goodnight!

56:40.163 --> 56:43.767
Tucker Aaronson and
Walden, may I help you?

56:53.676 --> 56:56.612
Uh, let me transfer you.

56:56.613 --> 56:58.848
Wow, those are
some ugly panties.

57:00.049 --> 57:04.153
Yeah, they, uh... for a case.

57:04.154 --> 57:09.124
We are working on the case of the
terrible granny panties, so...

57:09.125 --> 57:12.027
Must be a big case!

57:12.028 --> 57:17.100
It is. It is...

57:18.701 --> 57:20.970
- Hold all my calls.
- OK.

57:26.509 --> 57:28.710
Sharon Gottlieb?

57:28.711 --> 57:31.814
You might as well have told me
that size really doesn't matter

57:31.815 --> 57:35.617
and that the female orgasm
is made of rainbows.

57:35.618 --> 57:40.722
Well, I'm sorry that she surprised
you, but she didn't surprise me.

57:40.723 --> 57:42.124
It's probably been a long time

57:42.125 --> 57:44.059
since a man has looked at
her like that, you know?

57:44.060 --> 57:46.528
We gave her a golden
opportunity and she took it.

57:46.529 --> 57:51.200
She's clearly a sad woman with a
blown-out vagina that needed tending.

57:51.201 --> 57:55.704
I really wish I didn't
know that about her.

57:55.705 --> 58:00.476
But it's not everyone. It's
not even the majority.

58:00.477 --> 58:02.744
But it is.

58:02.745 --> 58:04.112
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

58:04.113 --> 58:05.714
You're wrong about people.

58:05.715 --> 58:06.849
It's not that simple.

58:06.850 --> 58:10.486
Yeah, well, I wish it weren't.

58:10.487 --> 58:12.521
You know, the tragic thing?

58:12.522 --> 58:15.525
That a 220-pound man wears
smiley-faced boxers?

58:16.926 --> 58:20.496
OK. OK, what's tragic?

58:20.497 --> 58:24.800
Well, the tragic thing
is that if you win,

58:24.801 --> 58:28.604
your blog lives on and you
get to write your book,

58:28.605 --> 58:34.177
but you and I get six months, and then...
it's over.

58:36.946 --> 58:39.282
I mean, six months is...

58:40.850 --> 58:42.218
God, that's nothing.

58:48.057 --> 58:50.659
Hey kids, how we doing?

58:50.660 --> 58:53.195
Simon, my man!

58:53.196 --> 58:56.131
We are doing fantastic.

58:56.132 --> 58:59.902
As a matter of fact, we've
got some great news.

58:59.903 --> 59:02.671
That loan for the penis
extension finally came through?

59:02.672 --> 59:05.674
This guy.

59:05.675 --> 59:07.643
No man, um,

59:07.644 --> 59:12.180
Lauren and I are
getting married.

59:12.181 --> 59:15.317
Wow, I mean...

59:15.318 --> 59:17.019
Wow, that was quick!

59:17.020 --> 59:19.087
Yeah. I'm not pregnant.

59:19.088 --> 59:22.624
Well then, drinks
are on the house.

59:22.625 --> 59:23.992
Hey, thank you, brother.

59:23.993 --> 59:26.628
And listen, I'd love to
have the bachelor party

59:26.629 --> 59:29.932
right here at Tucci's. Is the back
room available for Saturday night?

59:29.933 --> 59:31.867
- It's all yours.
- Awesome! Awesome!

59:31.868 --> 59:34.269
And we'll head back to my place
after for some shenanigans?

59:34.270 --> 59:38.206
Yeah, love it.

59:38.207 --> 59:40.943
- Huh?
- Bachelor party, huh?

59:40.944 --> 59:42.811
- Shenanigans?
- Hey, come on,

59:42.812 --> 59:44.913
what better opportunity
for someone to cheat

59:44.914 --> 59:46.114
than a bachelor party?

59:46.115 --> 59:47.683
It's practically
in the handbook.

59:47.684 --> 59:50.085
- I knew there was a handbook.
- Uh-huh.

59:50.086 --> 59:52.988
Listen, two of our competitors
are going to be there

59:52.989 --> 59:54.122
and you only need one to cheat

59:54.123 --> 59:55.691
for this competition to be over,

59:55.692 --> 59:58.860
so we're going to finish
this this weekend.

59:58.861 --> 01:00:00.163
Finish it?

01:00:01.664 --> 01:00:03.732
Well, that's what
you want, right?

01:00:03.733 --> 01:00:06.302
Your name in lights.
Glory, the big win?

01:00:08.071 --> 01:00:10.806
Yeah, all right.

01:00:10.807 --> 01:00:14.009
Saturday bachelor
party, we'll finish it.

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:17.012
Oh, and, uh, listen,

01:00:17.013 --> 01:00:20.916
I would love some
strippers for Saturday.

01:00:20.917 --> 01:00:23.619
Do you think Corina
knows any of those?

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:26.254
Gee, probably.

01:00:26.255 --> 01:00:29.658
I thought so. Resourceful
lady, that one.

01:00:29.659 --> 01:00:32.829
You have no idea.

01:00:34.731 --> 01:00:36.765
So, are you just doing
this for the gifts?

01:00:36.766 --> 01:00:38.300
'Cause we could
use a new Keurig.

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:41.336
- Nah, no gifts.
- Then why?

01:00:41.337 --> 01:00:44.172
Women are happy to stay
engaged for like, ever!

01:00:44.173 --> 01:00:46.008
It's a get out of
jail free card, man.

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:48.710
Does Danielle know this?

01:00:48.711 --> 01:00:52.114
She doesn't not know it.

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:55.050
Ahh, Jacob, you are an island.

01:00:55.051 --> 01:00:56.852
So check this out.

01:00:56.853 --> 01:00:59.755
It's the prototype for my new
app, Mars Calling Venus.

01:00:59.756 --> 01:01:01.757
A guy can ask Venus
anything he wants to know,

01:01:01.758 --> 01:01:02.958
and she'll tell him the truth

01:01:02.959 --> 01:01:04.660
about what women are
really thinking.

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:08.898
So, say for example...
sexual partners.

01:01:11.234 --> 01:01:14.803
The average woman has had eight
lovers, but when polled,

01:01:14.804 --> 01:01:18.774
76% said they'd lie and
answer four or less.

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:22.411
Naughty, naughty, Venus.
Naughty, naughty, Venus.

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:24.347
Is that it?

01:01:26.182 --> 01:01:27.983
Well, she gets naked.

01:01:27.984 --> 01:01:30.152
And I loaded her with
car and sports trivia.

01:01:30.153 --> 01:01:32.721
Ed got me a meeting with
some suits on Monday.

01:01:32.722 --> 01:01:34.289
Ooh, I'm going to be rich!

01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:37.759
Did you make her
look like Lauren?

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.995
- What?
- Yeah, you...

01:01:39.996 --> 01:01:42.030
Is that a mole under
her left eye?

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:45.701
Dude, you have lost your mind.

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:49.871
This woman has straight up crawled up
inside your brain and made you go wonky!

01:01:49.872 --> 01:01:52.809
So, party tonight at Tucci's?

01:01:55.144 --> 01:01:56.745
I'll wear a suit.

01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:58.980
You don't own a suit.

01:01:58.981 --> 01:02:01.718
You own a suit.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.354
I own a suit.

01:02:09.025 --> 01:02:12.061
I've had a lot of free time.

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:19.167
There's the three rings
of marriage, brother.

01:02:19.168 --> 01:02:22.804
There's the engagement
ring, the wedding ring,

01:02:22.805 --> 01:02:24.840
and then there's
the suffer-ring!

01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:28.376
Boo!

01:02:28.377 --> 01:02:30.780
Boo that man.

01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:34.916
Oh, man, I can't believe
you're getting married.

01:02:34.917 --> 01:02:38.053
You know how long Jenny has been
harassing me to pull the trigger?

01:02:38.054 --> 01:02:39.955
She wants four kids.

01:02:39.956 --> 01:02:41.790
Dang, that's a lot of kids.

01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:43.225
That is a lot of kids.

01:02:43.226 --> 01:02:46.294
In Korea we have large
families of many generations

01:02:46.295 --> 01:02:48.497
and we all live together
under one roof.

01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:50.499
You grew up in Napa Valley.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:51.900
But my people, we...
We started...

01:02:51.901 --> 01:02:54.537
Your parents own a winery...
in Napa!

01:02:59.809 --> 01:03:01.843
So, what flipped the switch?

01:03:01.844 --> 01:03:04.880
What can I say, fellas?
I love her.

01:03:04.881 --> 01:03:06.883
- I hope so.
- Drink to that.

01:03:10.186 --> 01:03:13.388
Mm. What about you, Ed,
do you love Kimberly?

01:03:13.389 --> 01:03:16.992
Um, let me see. I married the
girl when we were 18 years old,

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:18.894
so yeah, I think I love her.

01:03:18.895 --> 01:03:22.097
No, that's time, man.
I'm talking about love.

01:03:22.098 --> 01:03:25.000
Real love, the kind you
walk through fire for,

01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:26.334
you know what I'm saying?

01:03:26.335 --> 01:03:29.405
Well, yeah. She's my girl.

01:03:31.107 --> 01:03:33.041
Yeah, she is, right?

01:03:33.042 --> 01:03:35.076
And she's a good one.

01:03:35.077 --> 01:03:37.546
Things have been going great since
I started rubbing her feet.

01:03:37.547 --> 01:03:41.249
Sometimes she'll even put on
her old cheerleading outfit

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:43.585
- and wear it for me.
- There you go.

01:03:43.586 --> 01:03:46.822
- Jenny thinks outfits are silly.
- Yeah, well, they're not.

01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:49.591
My girl looks pretty
amazing in that outfit.

01:03:49.592 --> 01:03:52.093
Well, that sounds
like love to me, man.

01:03:52.094 --> 01:03:56.131
Cheerleader love.

01:03:56.132 --> 01:03:58.099
Does she still love you?

01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:59.367
Damn right, she loves me.

01:03:59.368 --> 01:04:01.303
What kind of question
is that to ask a man?

01:04:01.304 --> 01:04:03.940
-It's just a question. -Yeah,
come on, why so defensive?

01:04:05.174 --> 01:04:07.409
You boys better get
your heads in check.

01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:11.112
That woman loves me! She
calls me her Eddie Pie.

01:04:11.113 --> 01:04:13.014
What?

01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:15.217
Whoa, hold on, say that again?

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:18.954
It's not like an edible pie?
Like a Tasty Pastry?

01:04:18.955 --> 01:04:24.125
OK, Eddie Pie. I mean, it
sounds like you're it for her.

01:04:24.126 --> 01:04:26.895
Like, you are her White Knight.

01:04:26.896 --> 01:04:29.331
Hmm.

01:04:29.332 --> 01:04:32.100
Black Knight. I'm
her Black Knight.

01:04:32.101 --> 01:04:35.570
- Yes, you are. Black Knight.
- Yeah.

01:04:35.571 --> 01:04:37.105
No, No!

There you go.

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:56.958
Hey, all I'm saying is
you're a lucky man.

01:04:56.959 --> 01:05:00.362
That sense of truly finding the one?
It's pretty rare.

01:05:00.363 --> 01:05:02.597
Yeah.

01:05:02.598 --> 01:05:05.634
You call it. Do that.

01:05:05.635 --> 01:05:08.169
Maybe four isn't so many.

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:09.638
Now that's a butt load of kids.

01:05:09.639 --> 01:05:12.073
- Shh.
- That's a butt load of kids.

01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:15.144
That's a butt load of kids.

01:05:19.515 --> 01:05:21.918
I love you too, baby.

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:27.422
Maybe when I get home you can...

01:05:27.423 --> 01:05:32.193
wear that little...
outfit for me?

01:05:32.194 --> 01:05:33.462
All right.

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:39.201
All right. Bye-bye, baby.

01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:43.072
It's noisy in there, huh?

01:05:44.373 --> 01:05:46.943
You with all those crazy guys?

01:05:48.144 --> 01:05:50.112
Uh, yeah.

01:05:52.048 --> 01:05:54.983
It's hot in there, too.

01:05:54.984 --> 01:05:57.153
I'm Corina.

01:05:59.488 --> 01:06:00.957
Do you have a light?

01:06:03.559 --> 01:06:06.529
I don't smoke.

01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:11.067
Well, you look smoking to me.

01:06:13.402 --> 01:06:17.539
OK, OK... what you doing?

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:19.007
What do you mean,
"What am I doing?"

01:06:19.008 --> 01:06:20.175
I'm talking to you.

01:06:20.176 --> 01:06:22.244
You're doing more
than just that.

01:06:24.613 --> 01:06:27.717
Maybe I am. Do you have a name?

01:06:28.718 --> 01:06:30.285
I got a name.

01:06:30.286 --> 01:06:33.054
I just don't know I
want you to have it.

01:06:33.055 --> 01:06:34.757
Is that so?

01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:43.498
My name is Eddie Pie.

01:06:43.499 --> 01:06:45.701
I am a Black Knight.

01:06:47.236 --> 01:06:49.238

01:07:58.207 --> 01:07:59.808
- I know where I want it.
- Wait your turn.

01:07:59.809 --> 01:08:01.709
It's never my turn.

01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:04.646
- You want to take a shot?
- No, I'm trying to quit.

01:08:04.647 --> 01:08:08.750
Aww. Well, you don't mind
if I take one, do you?

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:09.784
- Yeah.
- Up.

01:08:09.785 --> 01:08:12.388
Wait. Whoa...

01:08:19.795 --> 01:08:21.629
OK...

01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:25.567
OK, now... where do we want it?

01:08:25.568 --> 01:08:26.734
I don't.

01:08:26.734 --> 01:08:28.368
Oh, you naughty boy.

01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:30.270
In the crotch, huh?

01:08:30.272 --> 01:08:33.542
That just so happens to be my
favorite place to take it.

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:37.545
How'd you know?

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:39.647
All right, now, you have
to be very careful,

01:08:39.648 --> 01:08:41.716
'cause if you move, it'll spill.

01:08:41.716 --> 01:08:44.486
And let me make one thing clear,

01:08:44.487 --> 01:08:49.825
I am taking that shot,
every last drop.

01:08:51.527 --> 01:08:52.627
Are we ready, boys?

01:08:52.627 --> 01:08:53.728
- Yeah.
- No, no.

01:08:53.729 --> 01:08:55.863
- Here we go!
- Ohh! Ohh!

01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:59.134
Oh! You naughty boy.

01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:04.706
Guess I'm just going to have to
clean you all up with my tongue.

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:07.309
- Ooh.
- Oh!

01:09:11.881 --> 01:09:13.716
Here's some ice...

01:09:19.555 --> 01:09:23.524
I'm really sorry, it
was just a reflex.

01:09:23.526 --> 01:09:25.493
Would you just make
yourself useful

01:09:25.493 --> 01:09:26.728
and hand me my purse?

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:29.930
I'm leaving.

01:09:29.932 --> 01:09:31.367
Thanks.

01:09:37.238 --> 01:09:38.908
I didn't want a shot.

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:55.523
Ooh, boy, you really screwed
that one up, buddy.

01:09:55.524 --> 01:09:57.358
I can understand you not wanting

01:09:57.359 --> 01:09:59.894
to show everyone Mr. Floppy,
but did you really have to

01:09:59.895 --> 01:10:01.696
knee that poor girl in the face?

01:10:01.697 --> 01:10:03.965
It was a reflex, man.

01:10:03.966 --> 01:10:06.735
Hey, uh, where's Simon?

01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:10.605
And... Mandy?

01:10:10.606 --> 01:10:13.508
Where are they?

01:10:13.509 --> 01:10:15.810
They went for a walk.

01:10:15.811 --> 01:10:18.514
Wait, you let them leave?

01:10:34.463 --> 01:10:35.830
- Hello?
- Hello, Lauren?

01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:37.365
It's Heather Decker.

01:10:37.366 --> 01:10:39.267
I have the update
on your book offer.

01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:41.970
They like the blog and
your story around that,

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:43.771
but they caught wind
of the competition.

01:10:43.772 --> 01:10:45.740
They think that's
a better angle.

01:10:45.741 --> 01:10:48.243
Caught wind of it? How?

01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:50.745
Your sister made a
call to the publisher.

01:10:50.746 --> 01:10:53.314
Apparently, she's not
a fan of your blog.

01:10:53.315 --> 01:10:56.552
She's pushing this new angle,
and they like it a lot.

01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:59.887
Gena is not a fan of the blog.

01:10:59.888 --> 01:11:01.956
Why doesn't she just
stay out of my life?

01:11:01.957 --> 01:11:04.926
Did you hear me, Lauren?
They are very interested.

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:07.896
They are offering two
million dollars for it.

01:11:10.366 --> 01:11:12.834
- Two million?
- Yes.

01:11:12.835 --> 01:11:16.704
But you have to win.
Otherwise, no deal.

01:11:16.705 --> 01:11:19.274
Are you still there?

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:20.975
They want to talk
to you on Monday.

01:11:20.976 --> 01:11:23.044
They want to get
started right away.

01:11:23.045 --> 01:11:25.446
Yeah, I'm still here.

01:11:25.447 --> 01:11:28.449
Listen, that's... that's
an incredible offer,

01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:30.051
that's amazing.

01:11:30.052 --> 01:11:32.353
It's just it takes
the whole thing

01:11:32.354 --> 01:11:33.988
into a completely
different direction

01:11:33.989 --> 01:11:35.957
and I'm not sure that's the book

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:37.493
that I want to write.

01:11:39.561 --> 01:11:42.864
Let me think about it for
a couple of days. OK?

01:11:42.865 --> 01:11:43.999
Thanks, Heather.

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:03.751
- Hey.
- How could you do it, man?

01:12:03.752 --> 01:12:06.654
- Do what?
- You know what.

01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:08.423
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:12:08.424 --> 01:12:12.327
Did you sleep with her? Did
you have sex with Mandy?

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:14.929
Look, man, I don't know what
you're talking about, all right?

01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:16.832
I thought you were
better than that.

01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:22.737
Ah! Get out of there, Cal, stop it!
Get off of me!

01:12:22.738 --> 01:12:23.871
You're still wearing
your underwear.

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:26.341
Yes, of course!

01:12:26.342 --> 01:12:27.642
What the hell, Cal!

01:12:27.643 --> 01:12:30.445
Well, did... did you
sleep with her or not?

01:12:30.446 --> 01:12:33.114
Yeah, I slept with her.

01:12:33.115 --> 01:12:34.982
Look,

01:12:34.983 --> 01:12:39.354
we went down to the
river and we talked.

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:41.022
After a little while
she made a move,

01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:44.359
but... I didn't want to.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:48.429
I mean, I wanted to, but...
I couldn't do it.

01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:51.966
I've never cheated on
Jenny, so we just slept.

01:12:51.967 --> 01:12:54.569
What are you laughing about?

01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:57.538
You, man! You're the man!!

01:12:57.539 --> 01:13:01.476
Oh, God, OK, all right!

01:13:01.477 --> 01:13:04.779
I knew it, I knew you were
one of the good guys, man!

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:08.649
I knew it! OK, that's two.

01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:10.619
- Come on, baby, yeah.
- All right, all right.

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:18.092
All right, I believe you.
You know...

01:13:18.093 --> 01:13:20.962
Of course, we'll never really
know what happened out there.

01:13:20.963 --> 01:13:23.531
But if Mandy didn't
get his underwear,

01:13:23.532 --> 01:13:26.801
then I guess we'll say
nothing happened.

01:13:26.802 --> 01:13:30.471
Although, she's quite
taken with Simon.

01:13:30.472 --> 01:13:32.840
She even wants me to let
her know when he's single.

01:13:32.841 --> 01:13:36.778
I don't think she's his type.

01:13:36.779 --> 01:13:40.014
Yeah? She said
he's the first man

01:13:40.015 --> 01:13:43.786
to ever turn her down. Ever.

01:13:46.655 --> 01:13:50.658
Hey, you know where I want to
take you when all this is over?

01:13:50.659 --> 01:13:52.660
It's not over yet.

01:13:52.661 --> 01:13:54.462
I'll take you to Paris.

01:13:54.463 --> 01:13:58.733
We can get some striped shirts
and live the life of the mimes.

01:13:58.734 --> 01:14:01.203
Really horny mimes.

01:14:05.541 --> 01:14:08.009
I know it's going to be tough
for you to shut down that blog,

01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:11.979
but, um, you know, maybe
you don't have to.

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:16.218
Maybe you could just... turn it
into something more positive.

01:14:20.756 --> 01:14:24.225
Well, there's one
more challenger left.

01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:26.694
It could go down either way.

01:14:26.695 --> 01:14:30.131
Ah, yes. The good
minister Dooley.

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:33.034
Well, I'm sorry, babe, but he's
a ringer for the home team.

01:14:33.035 --> 01:14:35.503
My man is legit.

01:14:35.504 --> 01:14:38.239
There is no way anyone
is going to convince him

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:40.975
to cheat on his wife. Oh...

01:14:40.976 --> 01:14:43.110
People can surprise you.

01:14:43.111 --> 01:14:46.481
Mm. Yes, they can.

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:49.918
If there's one thing this competition
has taught me it's that.

01:14:52.187 --> 01:14:53.788
Well, we've decided

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:55.223
to have the last challenge
at Corina's house.

01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:56.657
I'll text you the address.

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:58.526
Just tell the minister

01:14:58.527 --> 01:15:01.028
that he should come by around 7

01:15:01.029 --> 01:15:05.533
and that you have a friend
who needs some guidance.

01:15:05.534 --> 01:15:07.068
We're running a conversion con.

01:15:07.069 --> 01:15:10.771
A conversion con?

01:15:10.772 --> 01:15:12.240
Listen to you.

01:15:12.241 --> 01:15:13.941
It's a good thing
this is almost over.

01:15:13.942 --> 01:15:16.210
You're turning into
a regular gangster.

01:15:16.211 --> 01:15:19.514
Well, I have a meeting with
the publishers on Monday,

01:15:19.515 --> 01:15:25.086
they want to, you know, discuss
the book proposal, details...

01:15:25.087 --> 01:15:26.921
Well, either way,
you're going to have

01:15:26.922 --> 01:15:29.291
an interesting story to tell.

01:15:31.593 --> 01:15:33.995
Hey, you want to have dinner
with me tomorrow night

01:15:33.996 --> 01:15:36.197
while all this is going down?

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:37.932
You know, we can celebrate...

01:15:37.933 --> 01:15:40.635
either way, like a
couple of good sports.

01:15:40.636 --> 01:15:43.238
Wait for the results together?

01:15:45.173 --> 01:15:46.675
Yeah.

01:15:48.043 --> 01:15:49.278
I'd like that.

01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:51.847
Okay.

01:15:58.186 --> 01:16:00.221
I talked to Minister
Dooley this afternoon

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:02.557
and he was all in for bringing
in another lost sheep,

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:06.761
so... the last
competition has begun.

01:16:06.762 --> 01:16:08.262
May the best man win.

01:16:08.263 --> 01:16:10.933
May the best person win.

01:16:15.137 --> 01:16:16.705
Oh, excuse me.

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:20.808
Hello, this is Calvin.

01:16:20.809 --> 01:16:22.577
Uh-huh?

01:16:22.578 --> 01:16:24.679
Oh, you're kidding?

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:27.648
Yeah, is he all right?

01:16:27.649 --> 01:16:30.618
OK, sure. Sure, yeah,
thanks for letting me know.

01:16:30.619 --> 01:16:32.721
Uh-huh. Bye-bye.

01:16:34.356 --> 01:16:36.757
- Wow.
- What happened?

01:16:36.758 --> 01:16:40.294
Umm, Minister Dooley
is in the hospital.

01:16:40.295 --> 01:16:42.229
- What?
- Yeah, apparently,

01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:44.332
he broke his leg
playing hoops today.

01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:48.803
Oh, God, well... poor
Minister Dooley,

01:16:48.804 --> 01:16:51.806
but I'm supposed to be
meeting with the publisher

01:16:51.807 --> 01:16:54.108
on Monday... I can't
keep pushing them off.

01:16:54.109 --> 01:16:55.643
Yeah, I know. I know.

01:16:55.644 --> 01:17:00.348
Um. All right. We need
a new competitor.

01:17:00.349 --> 01:17:03.951
So, um...

01:17:03.952 --> 01:17:05.720
Jacob.

01:17:05.721 --> 01:17:07.388
I'll send Jacob, it's perfect.

01:17:07.389 --> 01:17:08.990
- Jacob?
- Yeah, sure,

01:17:08.991 --> 01:17:10.758
he's in the dark about
all this like we agreed,

01:17:10.759 --> 01:17:13.260
and he's been engaged to
Danielle for over a year,

01:17:13.261 --> 01:17:14.795
so he fits the bill, right?

01:17:14.796 --> 01:17:18.633
I'll just, uh, text
him that a friend

01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:21.202
needs help with her computer

01:17:21.203 --> 01:17:24.872
- and we'll see what happens.

01:17:24.873 --> 01:17:26.974
-It could work. -Yeah, yeah,
it's going to be good.

01:17:26.975 --> 01:17:29.644
It's going to be good. We are
still going to end this tonight.

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:32.313
Ah, he's free.

01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:38.152
Sweet! OK, let me text him
the address and boom.

01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:42.190
Done. We're back on, OK?

01:17:45.027 --> 01:17:47.061
He's kind of a freak, right?

01:17:47.062 --> 01:17:48.963
I mean, you sure you
want to use him?

01:17:48.964 --> 01:17:51.932
But... he doesn't
go for easy women.

01:17:51.933 --> 01:17:54.669
Huh, so, you scared?

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:56.003
Right? You're scared.

01:17:56.004 --> 01:17:58.072
You're sensing another
W for team Calvin.

01:17:58.073 --> 01:18:00.841
Don't refer to yourself
in the third person.

01:18:00.842 --> 01:18:03.244
And don't be a sore loser.

01:18:03.245 --> 01:18:06.347
All right? Excuse me,
I'm going to restroom.

01:18:06.348 --> 01:18:08.382
It's a close one.

01:18:08.383 --> 01:18:11.253
Jacob's good. Jacob's good.

01:18:26.468 --> 01:18:31.139
Oh, this is bad, bad, bad...

01:18:48.223 --> 01:18:49.423
Hey, Simon.

01:18:49.424 --> 01:18:51.325
Can you just, uh,

01:18:51.326 --> 01:18:53.894
tell Calvin that I started
feeling really bad

01:18:53.895 --> 01:18:56.063
and I had to leave and
I'll call him later?

01:18:56.064 --> 01:18:58.366
- Yeah.
- Great, thanks.

01:19:32.934 --> 01:19:35.870
Hey, Simon, man, did you
see where Lauren went?

01:19:35.871 --> 01:19:38.305
She said she wasn't feeling
well and that she'd call you.

01:19:38.306 --> 01:19:41.442
What, she just took off?
Did she look sick?

01:19:41.443 --> 01:19:44.045
She seemed kind
of pale, I guess?

01:19:58.393 --> 01:20:01.095
Oh, wow, Jacob, hey, come in!

01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:04.799
Hey, tech geek to the rescue.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:07.401
I don't know, you don't look
like a geek to me, Jacob.

01:20:07.402 --> 01:20:08.936
You OK?

01:20:08.937 --> 01:20:11.405
The computer's just in
the bedroom upstairs.

01:20:11.406 --> 01:20:14.109
O... kay.

01:20:17.946 --> 01:20:19.880
So, where's Cal?

01:20:19.881 --> 01:20:23.184
Oh... Cal didn't tell you?

01:20:23.185 --> 01:20:26.520
Yeah, we broke up last night.

01:20:26.521 --> 01:20:30.257
Everything was just
moving too fast.

01:20:30.258 --> 01:20:33.261
It's OK though. We're
still friends.

01:20:35.096 --> 01:20:36.965
Really?

01:20:41.469 --> 01:20:43.405
So...

01:20:46.541 --> 01:20:49.210
this is the one that's
giving me trouble.

01:20:49.211 --> 01:20:53.948
So, is it running
slowly or not at all?

01:20:53.949 --> 01:20:57.251
Slowly. But then it freezes
and then I have to

01:20:57.252 --> 01:20:59.153
shut the whole thing off
and start over again.

01:20:59.154 --> 01:21:01.121
It's-it's infuriating.

01:21:01.122 --> 01:21:03.123
It sounds like you just need
to clean up your hard drive,

01:21:03.124 --> 01:21:05.292
maybe run a de-frag.

01:21:05.293 --> 01:21:06.861
Let me clean some stuff up here

01:21:06.862 --> 01:21:08.395
to see if that
fixes the problem.

01:21:08.396 --> 01:21:10.866
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

01:21:12.601 --> 01:21:15.871
I'm lucky to have a bonafide
computer genius to help me.

01:21:18.506 --> 01:21:21.276
Yeah, that's me.

01:21:33.288 --> 01:21:34.488
Wow.

01:21:34.489 --> 01:21:36.891
What?

01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:38.626
Oh, your-your shoulders
are really tight.

01:21:38.627 --> 01:21:40.327
When was the last time
you had a massage?

01:21:40.328 --> 01:21:44.298
Oh, my God, I don't know. Never.

01:21:44.299 --> 01:21:46.166
Danielle doesn't give
you shoulder rubs?

01:21:46.167 --> 01:21:47.168
No.

01:21:50.472 --> 01:21:54.042
Here, unbutton this,
let me get in there.

01:21:57.479 --> 01:21:59.681
Oh, God, that feels good.

01:22:03.218 --> 01:22:04.219
Oh...

01:22:31.012 --> 01:22:34.281
Just need to let the de-frag
run a little while.

01:22:34.282 --> 01:22:35.449
Takes a bit.

01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:38.019
Thanks.

01:22:40.455 --> 01:22:45.627
So, you and Calvin
are definitely over?

01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:51.999
I just want this whole
thing to be over.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.568
I'm so confused.

01:22:54.569 --> 01:22:58.206
I just... I can't
even think straight.

01:23:00.608 --> 01:23:02.744
Broke up?

01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:10.651
Hey, hey, it's OK.

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:14.122
Everything is OK. I'm here.

01:23:16.057 --> 01:23:18.258
Yeah.

01:23:18.259 --> 01:23:20.462
Yeah, you are, aren't you?

01:23:21.663 --> 01:23:25.132
Yeah, I'm here.

01:23:25.133 --> 01:23:28.535
You've, uh, you've been
a great friend, Jacob.

01:23:28.536 --> 01:23:31.105
Yeah? All right.

01:23:31.106 --> 01:23:34.174
I think I understand
you pretty well.

01:23:34.175 --> 01:23:37.612
Yeah, I always really liked you.

01:23:40.615 --> 01:23:43.183
Oh, um... Sorry, sorry.

01:23:43.184 --> 01:23:47.287
Just my head really hurts.
I need an aspirin.

01:23:47.288 --> 01:23:49.289
You're the perfect
woman, Lauren.

01:23:49.290 --> 01:23:51.358
- What?
- You're the perfect woman.

01:23:51.359 --> 01:23:54.428
I created an app that I sold
for a ton of money this week

01:23:54.429 --> 01:23:57.698
and it's all about you.
The perfect woman.

01:23:57.699 --> 01:24:00.300
I'm going to be rich and now
that Calvin is out of the way,

01:24:00.301 --> 01:24:02.669
I can take care of you
like you deserve.

01:24:02.670 --> 01:24:08.142
Uhh, I'm not the perfect woman...
at all.

01:24:08.143 --> 01:24:11.211
You have no idea how
messed up I am, actually.

01:24:11.212 --> 01:24:14.415
Ohh, I'm so messed up, so maybe
we're perfect for each other!

01:24:14.416 --> 01:24:16.316
- Uh, wait, hold on.
- What?

01:24:16.317 --> 01:24:17.785
I think my phone is... yeah.

01:24:17.786 --> 01:24:20.354
Yeah, I did hear it...

01:24:20.355 --> 01:24:22.723
Uh, oh... Mom?

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:24.625
- Yeah, I'm, um...
- Lauren?

01:24:24.626 --> 01:24:26.693
You don't have to
tease me anymore.

01:24:26.694 --> 01:24:30.298
I'm already crazy about you.

01:24:43.211 --> 01:24:46.480
I knew... I always knew we would
be together, I just knew it!

01:24:46.481 --> 01:24:47.614
What the hell is
going on in here?

01:24:47.615 --> 01:24:48.682
Oh, my God, Calvin.

01:24:48.683 --> 01:24:51.085
Oh... Nothing, nothing.

01:24:51.086 --> 01:24:54.354
Absolutely nothing. Oh my...
I'm so sorry.

01:24:54.355 --> 01:24:59.226
It was the competition
and I was trying to win.

01:24:59.227 --> 01:25:04.131
Uh, isn't life really
a competition?

01:25:04.132 --> 01:25:05.299
Wait...

01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:07.434
Dude, you guys broke up!

01:25:07.435 --> 01:25:09.503
You're a pig, man!
What's wrong with you?

01:25:09.504 --> 01:25:10.871
You're supposed to
be my best friend.

01:25:10.872 --> 01:25:12.873
Ohh! I'm the pig?

01:25:12.874 --> 01:25:15.142
Is that how we're gonna play it?

01:25:15.143 --> 01:25:16.777
- What about you?
- What about me?

01:25:16.778 --> 01:25:19.680
Oh, perfect freakin'
undefeated Calvin Chesney

01:25:19.681 --> 01:25:22.749
never does anything
wrong, does he?

01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:24.384
Or does he?

01:25:24.385 --> 01:25:27.354
Huh, maybe we should ask
Gena what she thinks?

01:25:27.355 --> 01:25:28.489
Jake, don't.

01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:30.724
Gena? What is he talking about?

01:25:30.725 --> 01:25:32.426
Don't.

01:25:32.427 --> 01:25:34.628
Calvin slept with your
sister back in law school.

01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:36.731
Oh!

01:25:38.633 --> 01:25:41.201
- Lauren, Lauren, wait a minute.
- No.

01:25:41.202 --> 01:25:43.203
I didn't...

01:25:43.204 --> 01:25:45.572
Why did you do that, man?
What's wrong with you?

01:25:45.573 --> 01:25:48.476
- You should have told her.
- I didn't sleep with Gena!

01:25:50.211 --> 01:25:52.213
- Really?
- Really.

01:25:53.548 --> 01:25:55.149
No, no, that summer

01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:57.251
you guys were all
flirty and stuff.

01:25:57.252 --> 01:25:58.619
You guys acted like you did!

01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:00.921
No, man! We went on a few dates,

01:26:00.922 --> 01:26:03.158
but we're friends
for Christ's sake.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:08.595
Yeah, yeah, I see what I did there.
Sorry, my bad.

01:26:08.596 --> 01:26:11.799
Yeah, sorry about your lip.

01:26:13.334 --> 01:26:15.402
- Lauren!
- Oh, that hurts.

01:26:15.403 --> 01:26:17.372
Lauren! Lauren?

01:26:25.313 --> 01:26:26.647
Are you OK? What happened?

01:26:26.648 --> 01:26:27.948
Why didn't you
tell me the truth?

01:26:27.949 --> 01:26:30.584
What? Oh no, no, no, no.

01:26:30.585 --> 01:26:33.587
He... Look, he told me
as soon as he met you

01:26:33.588 --> 01:26:35.189
that he didn't want
to make partner

01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:36.690
just for getting you
to shut the blog down.

01:26:36.691 --> 01:26:37.891
- Wh-what?
- What?

01:26:37.892 --> 01:26:39.793
Oh no, no... Oh, that's nothing.

01:26:39.794 --> 01:26:42.296
- What's your thing?
- Why did you lie to me

01:26:42.297 --> 01:26:45.265
- about sleeping with Calvin?
- I didn't sleep with Calvin.

01:26:45.266 --> 01:26:46.667
Right, you didn't.

01:26:46.668 --> 01:26:47.768
No! I didn't.

01:26:47.769 --> 01:26:49.570
I... We went on a couple dates

01:26:49.571 --> 01:26:51.838
-in law school. -Then why
didn't you say anything?

01:26:51.839 --> 01:26:53.540
Because I didn't think
you needed to know.

01:26:53.541 --> 01:26:54.975
It was a long time
ago, it was nothing!

01:26:54.976 --> 01:26:56.643
You know, Gena,
you're such a slut.

01:26:56.644 --> 01:26:58.345
Excuse me?

01:26:58.346 --> 01:26:59.880
I enjoy my life the way it is,

01:26:59.881 --> 01:27:01.481
and I don't need
to answer to you,

01:27:01.482 --> 01:27:03.283
and I didn't sleep with Calvin.

01:27:03.284 --> 01:27:05.719
Why would you send me someone
you know is so wonderful

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:07.821
you know I would fall
in love with him?

01:27:07.822 --> 01:27:09.823
What, are you-are you
trying to hurt me?

01:27:09.824 --> 01:27:12.492
I'm sorry.

01:27:12.493 --> 01:27:13.994
I knew how wonderful he was.

01:27:13.995 --> 01:27:15.696
I knew you'd fall
in love with him.

01:27:15.697 --> 01:27:17.397
I was just trying to help.

01:27:17.398 --> 01:27:20.000
Well, I guess your instincts
are about as great as mine.

01:27:20.001 --> 01:27:23.537
You know, I came on
to Jacob tonight.

01:27:23.538 --> 01:27:24.738
What, why?

01:27:24.739 --> 01:27:27.341
It was the last challenge

01:27:27.342 --> 01:27:30.877
and, God, I wanted
to win, you know?

01:27:30.878 --> 01:27:33.780
And I knew he had a crush on me

01:27:33.781 --> 01:27:36.016
and I knew he would go for it,

01:27:36.017 --> 01:27:42.423
and Calvin came in at the...
oh, worst moment!

01:27:43.992 --> 01:27:45.959
He's not going to forgive me.

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:48.962
- Come here. I messed
this up so bad.

01:27:48.963 --> 01:27:50.865
Come here.

01:28:50.058 --> 01:28:53.427
I'm sorry I called you a
slut, that was stupid.

01:28:53.428 --> 01:28:56.597
That's all right. It
takes one to know one.

01:29:08.609 --> 01:29:10.944
Guess who got hitched!?

01:29:10.945 --> 01:29:12.979
We wanted to call!

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:17.117
- But my heart could not wait!
- But Alejandro insisted.

01:29:17.118 --> 01:29:21.621
It was a field with a
crescendo of grass for my...

01:29:21.622 --> 01:29:22.956
beloved...

01:29:22.957 --> 01:29:26.794
- So, we got...
- Married!

01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:31.631
Mom, really?

01:29:31.632 --> 01:29:35.969
Oh, no, what happened?

01:29:35.970 --> 01:29:40.507
Oh, you know, Gena and Calvin...

01:29:40.508 --> 01:29:43.944
Gena, how could you?

01:29:43.945 --> 01:29:48.448
Oh, it was a long time ago,
they just didn't tell me.

01:29:48.449 --> 01:29:49.983
Really, Gena? Do
you have to sleep

01:29:49.984 --> 01:29:54.421
- with every man in Portland?
- I did not sleep with him!

01:29:54.422 --> 01:29:56.690
The thing is, you
know, I just...

01:29:56.691 --> 01:29:58.658
I really love him.

01:29:58.659 --> 01:30:02.730
My heart is, was, so...

01:30:04.399 --> 01:30:05.766
full.

01:30:05.767 --> 01:30:09.136
You know, it takes time to
adjust to the fullness.

01:30:09.137 --> 01:30:11.671
He's probably really,
really hurt.

01:30:11.672 --> 01:30:15.142
Yeah, but the thing is, did
you intend to hurt him?

01:30:15.143 --> 01:30:18.044
- No, no.
- Would you do it again?

01:30:18.045 --> 01:30:20.680
- No, never.
- So, that's fine!

01:30:20.681 --> 01:30:22.582
He will forgive you.

01:30:22.583 --> 01:30:25.819
That's the beautiful
fantastic thing about love.

01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:26.920
You understand?

01:30:26.921 --> 01:30:29.790
Yeah. Well, the thing is,

01:30:29.791 --> 01:30:31.658
he's been lying to
me the whole time.

01:30:31.659 --> 01:30:34.628
So...

01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:35.996
How can I trust him?

01:30:35.997 --> 01:30:39.900
I have an idea.

01:30:39.901 --> 01:30:42.202
Lauren,

01:30:42.203 --> 01:30:44.738
you are going to
have to trust me.

01:30:44.739 --> 01:30:47.741
Oh... trust you?

01:30:47.742 --> 01:30:51.678
Yeah. You're just going
to have to do it.

01:30:51.679 --> 01:30:54.481
And this, all this needs
to be cleaned up,

01:30:54.482 --> 01:30:56.082
uh, Alejandro will you
move the cars outside

01:30:56.083 --> 01:30:57.451
- so they can't be seen?
- Of course.

01:30:57.452 --> 01:31:00.654
And Mom? Help me close
these curtains.

01:31:00.655 --> 01:31:04.558
And Lauren, you just stay
here and stay quiet.

01:31:04.559 --> 01:31:05.725
G, what are you up to?

01:31:05.726 --> 01:31:07.961
I'm the one who
started all this.

01:31:07.962 --> 01:31:11.899
Just give me a chance to
make it right, please?

01:31:16.037 --> 01:31:18.038
OK, do your worst.

01:31:18.039 --> 01:31:19.474
OK.

Please tell me you didn't
drive over here like that?

01:31:54.742 --> 01:31:57.177
Mm. I took an Uber.

01:31:57.178 --> 01:31:59.045
Good boy.

01:31:59.046 --> 01:32:03.149
Oh, is that what this is...
a work call?

01:32:03.150 --> 01:32:05.986
Yeah, I thought we could go over

01:32:05.987 --> 01:32:07.921
the husband's testimony again,

01:32:07.922 --> 01:32:10.223
you know, see if there's
anything we missed.

01:32:10.224 --> 01:32:13.860
I don't feel like
working tonight, Gena.

01:32:13.861 --> 01:32:15.228
Yeah, I can see that.

01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:17.631
I'm glad you called, though.

01:32:17.632 --> 01:32:19.633
I need a place to stay.

01:32:19.634 --> 01:32:22.869
Of course. You know I'm
always here for you.

01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:24.738
You want to tell
me what happened?

01:32:24.739 --> 01:32:27.073
You're really pretty.

01:32:27.074 --> 01:32:29.977
You're drunk. Why don't you
tell me what happened?

01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:39.286
The competition. The
last competition.

01:32:39.287 --> 01:32:43.089
Your sister thought

01:32:43.090 --> 01:32:44.658
it would be a kick

01:32:44.659 --> 01:32:47.661
to challenge my best friend
using herself as bait.

01:32:47.662 --> 01:32:50.697
Ouch, that must have stung.

01:32:50.698 --> 01:32:52.265
Yeah.

01:32:52.266 --> 01:32:53.300
Did he go for it?

01:32:53.301 --> 01:32:56.670
Yeah, he went for it.

01:32:56.671 --> 01:33:00.006
I don't know.

01:33:00.007 --> 01:33:03.677
Maybe... maybe Lauren's
right about people.

01:33:03.678 --> 01:33:05.845
Did she get his underwear?

01:33:05.846 --> 01:33:08.950
- What?
- Isn't that a rule?

01:33:10.084 --> 01:33:12.085
Yeah,

01:33:12.086 --> 01:33:14.854
but no, she... she
didn't get it.

01:33:14.855 --> 01:33:16.856
- I interrupted them.
- Oh.

01:33:16.857 --> 01:33:22.262
Well, then I guess, technically,
the challenge isn't over yet.

01:33:22.263 --> 01:33:25.198
No, no, it's over.

01:33:25.199 --> 01:33:29.003
Oh. Well, then cheers
to it being over.

01:33:36.177 --> 01:33:38.812
Do you think all men are pigs?

01:33:38.813 --> 01:33:44.017
I think all men can be
and so can all women.

01:33:44.018 --> 01:33:48.888
It's a choice we make every day.

01:33:48.889 --> 01:33:52.659
What about me? Am I a pig?

01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:58.031
I think you can
be if you choose.

01:33:58.032 --> 01:34:00.634
If I choose.

01:34:00.635 --> 01:34:02.936
Exactly.

01:34:02.937 --> 01:34:06.774
Aww, you're hurt.

01:34:08.042 --> 01:34:09.310
Mm.

01:34:10.978 --> 01:34:13.647
Hey, um, you got a
glass for this?

01:34:13.648 --> 01:34:15.216
I hate drinking from the bottle.

01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:21.321
- Boo.
- Oh, hi.

01:34:21.322 --> 01:34:23.790
It's really hot in here. I
don't think you need this.

01:34:23.791 --> 01:34:25.725
OK.

01:34:25.726 --> 01:34:27.694
You know, Cal, there is a reason

01:34:27.695 --> 01:34:29.696
you were so willing to
come over here tonight.

01:34:29.697 --> 01:34:34.034
-There is? -Yeah, you know
it, if you think about it.

01:34:34.035 --> 01:34:36.804
If you're honest with yourself.

01:34:39.674 --> 01:34:41.675
You and me are like
the same person, Cal,

01:34:41.676 --> 01:34:45.311
and people like Lauren,
they have strict rules

01:34:45.312 --> 01:34:47.781
that control their
lives, you know.

01:34:47.782 --> 01:34:51.052
They need those
rules to feel safe.

01:34:52.319 --> 01:34:53.753
And people like us?

01:34:53.754 --> 01:34:56.022
We don't have rules.

01:34:56.023 --> 01:35:00.860
We just listen to our wants
and desires and follow them.

01:35:00.861 --> 01:35:07.001
No right or wrong,
just instinct.

01:35:08.836 --> 01:35:11.337
Shh.

01:35:11.338 --> 01:35:12.906
Wait what was that, did
you hear something?

01:35:12.907 --> 01:35:15.308
There's a TV on upstairs.

01:35:15.309 --> 01:35:17.777
Remember that summer
we spent together?

01:35:17.778 --> 01:35:20.413
- Yeah.
- Remember how good that felt?

01:35:20.414 --> 01:35:25.119
- Yeah.
- No strings, just instinct.

01:35:26.854 --> 01:35:29.023
No one has to know.

01:35:32.727 --> 01:35:34.028
Stop.

01:35:35.329 --> 01:35:37.931
Stop right there.

01:35:37.932 --> 01:35:40.834
This isn't happening.

01:35:40.835 --> 01:35:43.136
What's not happening?

01:35:43.137 --> 01:35:45.839
This! Me and you.

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:49.142
Because even if nobody knows
that you did a bad thing,

01:35:49.143 --> 01:35:50.744
it's still a bad thing.

01:35:50.745 --> 01:35:54.781
And this, this, Gena, is
a very, very bad thing.

01:35:54.782 --> 01:35:56.750
You know, you're wrong about me,

01:35:56.751 --> 01:35:59.519
because I believe in love,
I believe in romance.

01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:01.354
I believe in the
soulful chemistry

01:36:01.355 --> 01:36:03.957
between two people that
just can't be explained.

01:36:03.958 --> 01:36:06.526
I believe in bourbon, you know?

01:36:06.527 --> 01:36:09.996
I believe in black coffee,
strong black coffee.

01:36:09.997 --> 01:36:11.965
I believe in getting eight
hours of sleep at night,

01:36:11.966 --> 01:36:14.467
and doing at least one thing
to better yourself every day.

01:36:14.468 --> 01:36:17.804
I believe the practice of law
is fundamentally imperfect,

01:36:17.805 --> 01:36:20.373
but we do the best we can,
and sometimes we do good.

01:36:20.374 --> 01:36:23.510
I believe that hook-up websites prey
on people's fears of inadequacy,

01:36:23.511 --> 01:36:25.378
novels are always
better than movies,

01:36:25.379 --> 01:36:27.514
and no formula,
scientific or otherwise,

01:36:27.515 --> 01:36:30.784
can determine with absolute certainty
if someone is going to cheat or not!

01:36:30.785 --> 01:36:33.820
Yes, I believe in instincts.

01:36:33.821 --> 01:36:36.823
But unlike you, I know
there is right and wrong,

01:36:36.824 --> 01:36:38.958
and the wrong thing
here is to indulge you

01:36:38.959 --> 01:36:41.795
in whatever this is, because,
A, you're my boss now,

01:36:41.796 --> 01:36:43.830
and as weirdly hot
as that might be,

01:36:43.831 --> 01:36:47.000
it jeopardizes everything I've
worked for and it's also illegal.

01:36:47.001 --> 01:36:49.836
B, if it was ever going to
work out between us, Gena,

01:36:49.837 --> 01:36:52.305
it already would have
a long time ago.

01:36:52.306 --> 01:36:56.376
And C, because you used me for this
stupid little scheme of yours.

01:36:56.377 --> 01:36:58.946
I met Lauren.

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:02.082
I love her.

01:37:03.450 --> 01:37:05.552
OK?

01:37:05.553 --> 01:37:07.587
I love her.

01:37:07.588 --> 01:37:09.389
She's everything I
want in a partner.

01:37:09.390 --> 01:37:12.091
She's beautiful, she's
smart, she's quirky...

01:37:12.092 --> 01:37:15.128
Yes, she's stubborn, but that's
because she knows what she wants.

01:37:15.129 --> 01:37:18.364
At least, she thinks she does,
and I think that's adorable.

01:37:18.365 --> 01:37:21.367
She loves pizza and hiking
and sleeping in on Sunday.

01:37:21.368 --> 01:37:23.503
Her interests are just
different enough from mine

01:37:23.504 --> 01:37:26.139
that we'll always be able to
show each other new things.

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:30.043
And I get butterflies when I
know I'm about to see her.

01:37:30.044 --> 01:37:33.046
And no, she's not perfect.

01:37:33.047 --> 01:37:36.916
But she's perfect for me.

01:37:36.917 --> 01:37:40.353
And I don't care what I have
to do or how long it takes.

01:37:40.354 --> 01:37:42.555
I'm going to prove it to her.

01:37:42.556 --> 01:37:45.024
You just did.

01:37:45.025 --> 01:37:48.261
Congratulations, Cal, you
were the last challenger.

01:37:48.262 --> 01:37:51.498
You had to be, and you won.

01:37:54.335 --> 01:37:56.170
Lauren, hi.

01:37:57.605 --> 01:37:59.205
You love me?

01:37:59.206 --> 01:38:01.609
With everything I got.

01:38:03.978 --> 01:38:05.646
I love you, too.

01:38:08.549 --> 01:38:12.085
OK... OK.

01:38:12.086 --> 01:38:15.989
So, what do you say we put all this
behind us and start again, huh?

01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:18.259
No expiration date.

01:38:23.163 --> 01:38:25.298
To love!
