WEBVTT

00:00.400 --> 00:03.360
The Yakuza shipment for Mei is vanadium.

00:03.480 --> 00:05.520
Use the missile technology.

00:05.680 --> 00:08.640
We'll be facing a rogue state
with a million-man army

00:08.800 --> 00:11.400
able to launch a nuclear
strike at a moment's notice.

00:11.520 --> 00:13.920
The exchange can't be delayed.

00:13.921 --> 00:14.994
Section 20?

00:14.995 --> 00:17.370
They were grasping at straws.

00:17.490 --> 00:19.490
Damien, Damien, Damien!

00:20.928 --> 00:24.090
I've got to find some transport
and get back to my team.

00:24.250 --> 00:26.930
Bravo One. Have you got
eyes on the metal yet?

00:27.050 --> 00:28.450
No, that's a negative.

00:34.810 --> 00:36.810
The vanadium has to be
in the trucks, pursue.

00:39.380 --> 00:40.340
You're too late.

00:41.622 --> 00:45.862
All this noise, the gunfire. Nothing
more than smoke and mirrors.

00:47.013 --> 00:50.302
In a few hours, the vanadium
will be in North Korea

00:50.462 --> 00:52.582
and all that you did will be for nothing.

01:28.302 --> 01:30.782
I guess I'll see you in
another 16 years or so.

01:30.902 --> 01:33.262
Look, kid, I got a job to do.

01:33.382 --> 01:34.794
In case you haven't noticed,

01:34.795 --> 01:36.622
there's a lot of shit going on around here.

01:39.102 --> 01:41.302
Look.

01:41.462 --> 01:45.022
If you want to hang out at
the hotel for a while...

01:45.142 --> 01:46.502
you can.

01:46.622 --> 01:48.182
I'll be back in a couple of days.

01:48.302 --> 01:49.742
Yeah.

01:49.862 --> 01:51.622
Yeah, if you're sure.

01:51.742 --> 01:52.862
Come on.

02:01.382 --> 02:03.702
- There.
- Yeah.

02:07.102 --> 02:08.422
Your point of entry

02:08.542 --> 02:11.222
is here, just over the border.

02:11.382 --> 02:13.656
Groups of Russian construction
workers are bussed in daily to

02:13.657 --> 02:15.462
help with the new rail line.

02:15.622 --> 02:18.022
A foreman is being paid
off to smuggle both you

02:18.142 --> 02:19.942
and the C-4 into North Korea.

02:20.185 --> 02:22.083
_

02:25.422 --> 02:26.822
What did he say?

02:26.942 --> 02:28.742
He said you have a very pretty mouth

02:28.902 --> 02:31.422
and he'd love to buy you a drink sometime.

02:31.582 --> 02:33.422
'We can't risk the metal
detectors picking up

02:33.542 --> 02:35.262
'the blasting caps and weapons.

02:35.422 --> 02:38.502
'So you'll be getting them' once
you are inside the country.

02:38.662 --> 02:41.262
'So, what we do, walk into Best
Buy and pick some shit up?'

02:41.382 --> 02:42.422
Nope.

02:42.582 --> 02:45.422
You'll meet up with our MI6
contact outside Pyongyang.

02:45.542 --> 02:46.862
We got someone in North Korea?

02:47.022 --> 02:50.582
Your contact is Mr Park. He'll
provide you with what you need.

02:50.742 --> 02:52.542
Find out where Mei's taken the vanadium...

02:53.742 --> 02:54.902
and dispose of it.

02:55.022 --> 02:56.302
In other words...

02:57.702 --> 02:59.542
Blow it the hell up.

02:59.662 --> 03:01.062
Easy for you to say.

03:01.222 --> 03:03.622
Someone spots us once in
a country like that...

03:04.267 --> 03:06.853
Another pair of dog tags
to add to the pile.

03:08.942 --> 03:11.742
Exfil is set for 72 hours
once you cross the border.

03:11.902 --> 03:14.622
The longer you spend out there, the
greater the risk of discovery.

03:14.742 --> 03:15.861
If you are captured,

03:15.862 --> 03:18.422
it would be construed as
an act of war on our part.

03:18.542 --> 03:19.942
There is nothing we can do.

03:21.822 --> 03:22.862
You're on your own.

08:26.380 --> 08:27.965
It's been a long time.

08:33.308 --> 08:35.668
Not much has changed since we trained here.

08:38.347 --> 08:40.073
This was your desk.

08:43.676 --> 08:44.724
This was mine.

08:47.036 --> 08:48.509
I am to be your liaison.

08:49.695 --> 08:52.406
To facilitate your transition
back to life here.

08:53.636 --> 08:55.596
My liaison, huh?

08:55.716 --> 08:57.836
The Party wants you to watch me

08:57.996 --> 09:02.436
to make sure that I haven't been
infected by my time in the West.

09:02.556 --> 09:04.716
Some things don't change.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.956
Be careful, Yoon Soo.

09:07.076 --> 09:08.916
Don't get too close.

09:09.507 --> 09:11.133
Or you might catch something.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.437
I did worry...

09:25.273 --> 09:26.566
that you would be different.

09:30.278 --> 09:31.995
It's been a long time.

09:31.996 --> 09:33.614
And we are both different.

10:57.756 --> 11:00.276
- Mr Park? Were you followed?
- No.

11:00.396 --> 11:02.276
We're professionals.

11:02.396 --> 11:04.316
Wait right here.

11:04.476 --> 11:07.876
When do I get out? I've told
them, I can't do this any more.

11:08.036 --> 11:10.316
- Mr Park...
- They don't understand this place.

11:10.436 --> 11:12.156
Can't trust anybody.

11:12.276 --> 11:15.196
Neighbours. Even family.

11:15.316 --> 11:19.476
Take pills. Two, three before bed.

11:19.477 --> 11:21.618
Just to make sure I don't talk in my sleep.

11:21.619 --> 11:22.835
Yeah, we get it. Alright?

11:22.836 --> 11:24.556
You can trust us, there
is no need to worry.

11:24.676 --> 11:27.693
It has all been arranged. You
help us, we'll help you.

11:32.441 --> 11:35.695
Three days ago, I noticed
troop transfer request.

11:35.696 --> 11:38.236
Increased patrols around
North Hamgyong Province,

11:38.356 --> 11:39.316
iron and steel complex.

11:39.476 --> 11:41.151
What, you think our target is headed there?

11:41.152 --> 11:42.116
Yes, I think that.

11:42.236 --> 11:43.916
That is why I am telling you this.

11:44.076 --> 11:47.076
Our intel said you may have
some equipment for us as well.

11:51.676 --> 11:52.756
So...

11:52.916 --> 11:55.316
- How are The Beatles?
- Oh, they're great.

11:55.476 --> 11:58.235
John, Paul, George and that other guy.

11:58.236 --> 12:00.515
Yeah, they are still going strong.

12:00.516 --> 12:02.458
I love their Christmas album.

12:11.156 --> 12:12.316
Look at that.

12:12.436 --> 12:14.476
1979 called and wants its gun back.

12:24.356 --> 12:25.476
Hey, hey.

12:27.316 --> 12:29.396
Hey, boss, it's me. 'You hear me?'

12:29.556 --> 12:31.716
- Loud and clear, Michael.
- 'We made it through.'

12:31.836 --> 12:33.276
We've got the blasting caps.

12:33.396 --> 12:34.956
We've also got a location.

12:35.076 --> 12:37.356
North Hamgyong, iron and steel.

12:37.516 --> 12:39.716
We've got maps as well,
but they're a bit dated.

12:39.876 --> 12:42.316
I'll try and source you
some more recent ones.

12:42.436 --> 12:43.356
Roger that.

12:44.563 --> 12:45.762

12:47.210 --> 12:48.859

13:34.584 --> 13:36.257
Bravo One, sitrep.

13:42.156 --> 13:43.561
Anything?

13:44.276 --> 13:45.721
You've got to get him back.

13:58.629 --> 14:00.005
Fuck!

14:21.156 --> 14:24.076
Fuck! Fuck!

14:27.196 --> 14:29.156
- How many?
- A lot.

14:29.276 --> 14:30.316
That many?

14:37.796 --> 14:39.356
Come on, come on!

14:40.676 --> 14:42.546
Come on, let's go!

14:48.916 --> 14:51.830
Come on, let's go. Come on, come on!

15:01.676 --> 15:03.156
Scott!

15:03.276 --> 15:04.996
Scott, the window!

15:05.116 --> 15:07.596
Huh? All right, let's go!

15:13.436 --> 15:15.476
Fuck!

15:20.396 --> 15:21.476
Oi!

15:26.196 --> 15:27.819
Sorry, kid.

15:32.697 --> 15:34.297
Shit.

15:34.315 --> 15:36.075
- Come on.
- How's that phone coming along?

15:38.475 --> 15:39.915
Fuck, dude.

15:40.035 --> 15:42.715
No phoning home with that one, Mikey.

15:42.940 --> 15:44.060
There you go.

15:46.060 --> 15:47.273
Brilliant.

15:49.340 --> 15:52.300
We've lost our comms and
we've been compromised.

16:00.020 --> 16:02.780
Aborting the mission is an option.

16:02.914 --> 16:04.274
- No fucking way.
- Ha!

16:04.394 --> 16:06.136
Which we have discussed maturely.

16:06.137 --> 16:08.459
- And both agreed on.
- Thank you.

16:10.250 --> 16:14.154
All right. Let's set a course across
country for North Hamgyong Province.

16:14.446 --> 16:15.954
Bearing in mind, if we're caught,

16:16.114 --> 16:18.994
the best we can hope for is to be
tortured, thrown in the gulags.

16:18.995 --> 16:21.460
Not to mention the international
repercussions for our little

16:21.461 --> 16:23.154
act of terrorism.

16:23.274 --> 16:24.674
You finished now?

16:24.794 --> 16:26.674
Yeah.

16:26.834 --> 16:29.274
Your motivational speech
needs a bit of work, Mikey.

16:29.434 --> 16:32.114
There's 40 clicks of hostile
terrain between here and there,

16:32.234 --> 16:33.714
plenty of time to work on it.

16:33.874 --> 16:36.674
Let's go. I don't want to
keep that bitch waiting.

16:36.675 --> 16:38.867
- Hey...
- What?

16:39.491 --> 16:41.514
- Just so you know...
- Yeah?

16:41.674 --> 16:43.917
Even if you stick a bullet
between her eyes...

16:44.222 --> 16:46.095
it's not going to bring Julia back.

16:49.114 --> 16:50.914
I know.

16:51.034 --> 16:52.100
Let's go.

17:03.794 --> 17:05.794
Third patroller in an hour, bud.

17:06.944 --> 17:09.594
Our luck's not going to hold out.

17:09.753 --> 17:11.518
Maybe it has something
to do with the fact that

17:11.519 --> 17:13.674
we're laying in a graveyard.

17:13.794 --> 17:15.394
We're clear, let's move.

17:19.594 --> 17:22.513
The government forces people to
work even though there's no wages.

17:22.674 --> 17:24.794
If there's no wages, there's
no food on the table.

17:24.954 --> 17:28.954
No food on the table, you end up
burying the dead on a hillside.

17:29.114 --> 17:31.594
They save their money for
the fucking nukes, dude.

17:31.714 --> 17:33.354
It's a policy called Songun.

17:33.514 --> 17:35.874
It means military first, no matter what.

17:35.875 --> 17:38.394
Sounds perfect for you.
You should move here.

17:38.514 --> 17:39.994
Even I have my limits, mate.

17:57.354 --> 18:00.794
We have a patrol searching for Section 20.
They won't get far.

18:00.795 --> 18:03.354
You have no idea what 20 are capable of.

18:04.474 --> 18:06.794
We need to consider moving production.

18:06.914 --> 18:08.634
That's not an option.

18:08.834 --> 18:11.394
To delay now would be a
catastrophic loss of face for those

18:11.554 --> 18:13.554
in the regime who supported this programme.

18:13.714 --> 18:16.834
Then we need to double the number
of troops guarding the plant.

18:16.954 --> 18:18.194
This is my life's work,

18:18.314 --> 18:20.034
and I will not let them ruin it.

18:20.194 --> 18:22.434
So find a way to work within the system.

18:22.594 --> 18:26.114
There is a contingency plan
I wish to put into place,

18:26.234 --> 18:27.991
to nullify the threat.

18:27.992 --> 18:29.939
Very well.

18:29.940 --> 18:31.354
Carry on.

18:53.554 --> 18:56.154
Kim. Yeah, it's Finn.

18:56.155 --> 18:58.400
Yeah, I'm just getting some food.
You want anything?

18:59.661 --> 19:01.794
All right, we got...

19:03.524 --> 19:04.985
Fish on a stick.

19:06.034 --> 19:07.314
There's chicken.

19:07.434 --> 19:09.041
Just one... Yeah.

19:09.042 --> 19:10.409
OK, two. Two.

19:10.410 --> 19:12.171
I'll catch you later, Kim.

19:12.172 --> 19:14.356
All right. How much?

19:16.954 --> 19:18.194
No, I gave you 20.

19:18.314 --> 19:20.474
I gave you 20. All right, thank you.

19:20.475 --> 19:21.855
Hey, you.

19:21.856 --> 19:23.331
You British?

19:23.443 --> 19:24.634
American.

19:24.754 --> 19:26.794
Same as Leonardo di Caprio.

19:26.914 --> 19:29.474
Yeah. Yeah, we're brothers.

19:29.594 --> 19:31.034
What's your name?

19:31.154 --> 19:32.114
Finn.

19:34.314 --> 19:36.034
Nice to meet you, Finn.

19:36.154 --> 19:37.194
The American.

19:37.314 --> 19:39.474
Have a nice day.

19:39.594 --> 19:41.034
Thanks.

19:41.154 --> 19:42.394
Have a nice day, too.

20:30.954 --> 20:32.154
Oh, fuck!

20:56.634 --> 20:59.474
Get on the phone to Finn.
We've got to get out of here.

21:09.139 --> 21:10.593
No answer.

21:10.594 --> 21:12.474
We need to get to him. Now.

22:23.954 --> 22:26.006
- Hey. Yeah.
- 'Finn!' 'Where are you?'

22:26.007 --> 22:27.468
Something's just happened,

22:27.469 --> 22:29.634
there were these guys here
chasing me that had guns.

22:29.794 --> 22:31.418
- 'Are you OK?'
- I don't know what happened,

22:31.419 --> 22:32.856
but I managed... Aah!

22:35.954 --> 22:38.194
'What's going on, Finn? Talk to me!

22:38.314 --> 22:39.474
'Finn!

22:45.794 --> 22:47.074
'Finn!'

22:49.488 --> 22:50.557
You okay?

22:51.748 --> 22:52.868
Yeah, I guess.

22:53.988 --> 22:55.188
What is it?

22:56.748 --> 22:58.393
There's something I've gotta ask you, Mikey.

22:58.394 --> 22:59.587
Yeah?

22:59.588 --> 23:01.874
There's 20 clicks between
here and deployment.

23:02.740 --> 23:04.548
When you lost Kerry...

23:05.592 --> 23:07.135
How did you deal with it?

23:07.761 --> 23:09.267
Well, that's a little heavy.

23:09.268 --> 23:12.230
I thought you were going to ask
me something simpler than that.

23:14.428 --> 23:16.518
I don't know. I guess I just assumed

23:16.519 --> 23:18.228
if I moved through life fast enough,

23:18.229 --> 23:20.148
I could run away from it all.

23:20.268 --> 23:22.148
How is it going for you?

23:22.308 --> 23:25.320
- Well, here we are...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

23:27.348 --> 23:28.508
Fuck.

23:32.588 --> 23:34.028
It's all right.

23:37.068 --> 23:38.228
Shit.

23:41.988 --> 23:45.202
Scott, we can't let them report us.

23:47.468 --> 23:49.668
What are you going to do?

23:49.788 --> 23:50.987
Shoot 'em?

23:52.428 --> 23:53.510
No, of course not.

23:55.068 --> 23:56.348
It's all right.

23:59.228 --> 24:00.428
It's all right.

24:05.948 --> 24:07.181
You hungry?

24:12.788 --> 24:14.148
It's good. It's food.

24:18.200 --> 24:19.548
It's OK.

24:21.588 --> 24:22.736
Some more?

24:29.788 --> 24:32.187
It's all right. It's chocolate.

24:32.188 --> 24:33.868
It's good.

24:50.068 --> 24:51.451
Scott.

24:51.452 --> 24:54.272
You owe me some of your rations, mate.

24:54.273 --> 24:55.759
Yeah.

24:57.548 --> 24:59.308
Roger that.

24:59.468 --> 25:02.348
Well, word is out to our contacts
in the police at borders.

25:02.508 --> 25:05.108
We have got as many people as
possible looking for Finn.

25:05.268 --> 25:07.788
They must have been lying
in wait, watching.

25:07.948 --> 25:10.948
Fuck, I should have just
kept a better eye on him.

25:11.108 --> 25:12.274
This wasn't your fault.

25:12.275 --> 25:14.428
Yeah, sure, and neither was Julia's death?

25:14.588 --> 25:17.428
It just so happens that
I'm there both times.

25:17.588 --> 25:19.908
I'll give you five seconds
to feel sorry for yourself,

25:20.068 --> 25:21.579
then I need your head back in the game.

25:22.948 --> 25:23.987
OK?

25:23.988 --> 25:25.667
We have got to find Finn.

25:25.668 --> 25:27.534
And we need to help Scott and
Stonebridge in the field.

25:28.148 --> 25:30.441
The DEA has requested that I go back.

25:31.108 --> 25:33.988
What, are you choosing this
moment to hand in your notice?

25:34.148 --> 25:37.188
No, I am choosing this moment to
use the leverage that it gives me

25:37.308 --> 25:39.228
- with them.
- Go on.

25:39.388 --> 25:41.428
North Korea traffics drugs into Asia,

25:41.588 --> 25:43.432
- raising cash for their regime, right?
- Right.

25:43.433 --> 25:45.787
Well, the agency has had
eyes on them in the sky,

25:45.788 --> 25:47.748
although they deny it on all levels.

25:47.908 --> 25:51.148
If I push, we might be able to
piggyback on the satellite,

25:51.308 --> 25:54.388
and that way we can keep eyes
on the guys in the field.

25:54.508 --> 25:55.628
Good.

26:37.398 --> 26:40.282
_

26:42.767 --> 26:45.868
We have extra security on
all entrances to the plant.

26:46.028 --> 26:48.635
And your request for
reinforcements is being processed.

26:48.636 --> 26:52.487
And what does that mean? That they
will be here in an hour? A day?

26:52.761 --> 26:56.682
This isn't a time for Party visits
and premature celebrations.

26:57.468 --> 27:00.031
It doesn't matter to them as much, does it?

27:00.868 --> 27:03.508
They just want the missiles for posturing.

27:03.668 --> 27:07.235
They may as well be wheeled into a museum
for all the good they will do.

27:07.236 --> 27:10.548
You should be careful what you say.

27:10.549 --> 27:11.747
Of course.

27:11.748 --> 27:14.268
I forgot, you're my liaison,

27:14.388 --> 27:16.308
you should join in the celebrations.

27:16.468 --> 27:19.955
Apparently, our nation
is already victorious.

27:25.672 --> 27:27.387
We need to put C-4 charges

27:27.388 --> 27:30.201
in four different areas of the plant
in order to compromise the vanadium.

27:30.948 --> 27:32.566
One on the processor here.

27:33.828 --> 27:35.426
One on the turbines.

27:35.708 --> 27:37.388
The control room.

27:37.548 --> 27:40.628
And last of all, the smelting furnace here.

27:43.068 --> 27:44.681
When did you start reading Korean?

27:46.028 --> 27:47.947
I didn't, I'm just looking at pictures.

27:48.977 --> 27:50.668
Right.

27:50.828 --> 27:53.508
So we're blowing the shit out
of a bathroom, probably.

27:53.668 --> 27:57.307
Well... Unless the toilet's the
size of blasting furnaces,

27:57.308 --> 27:58.548
that's highly unlikely.

27:58.668 --> 27:59.988
Got an entry point?

28:01.268 --> 28:03.188
No, nothing yet.

28:08.868 --> 28:10.188
I think I found one.

28:10.308 --> 28:12.588
Mikey.

28:12.708 --> 28:14.028
Look under there.

28:14.148 --> 28:15.828
You see that?

28:15.948 --> 28:18.348
- Mercedes.
- Yeah, I see it.

28:24.108 --> 28:26.428
- Yeah.
- Security didn't stop it.

28:26.548 --> 28:28.755
That's a classic way in.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.156
Let's go find it.

28:45.032 --> 28:46.720
_

28:48.458 --> 28:50.046
_

28:50.216 --> 28:51.855
_

28:52.215 --> 28:54.772
_

28:55.342 --> 28:57.400
_

28:57.526 --> 28:59.911
_

29:00.048 --> 29:02.009
_

29:02.010 --> 29:06.104
_

29:15.310 --> 29:16.709
_

29:16.710 --> 29:18.857
_

29:26.850 --> 29:29.072
_

29:39.668 --> 29:41.188
Sit down there.

29:54.028 --> 29:56.068
That was actually a decent vintage, mate.

29:56.188 --> 29:57.988
Next time, throw the cheap stuff.

30:24.748 --> 30:26.228
- Clear, bud?
- Clear!

30:32.348 --> 30:33.668
Up.

30:33.788 --> 30:35.548
Get up, on your feet.

30:41.428 --> 30:45.912
Mate, there is two of us and one
of you, that is a terrible answer.

30:46.748 --> 30:49.548
Do you want to shoot him, Mike?
Looks like he's going to shoot me.

30:49.549 --> 30:51.226
Yeah, well, we need him, Scott.

31:02.228 --> 31:03.375
Stand up.

31:10.228 --> 31:12.008
Fuck.
How is she, Scott?

31:13.068 --> 31:14.188
She's gone.

31:19.228 --> 31:22.988
Bravo One, your call is very, very welcome.

31:23.148 --> 31:24.836
'I think we found a way into the plant.'

31:26.066 --> 31:28.577
Good. 'If all goes according to plan,

31:28.578 --> 31:31.308
'ETA for setting the charges
should be 30 minutes or so.'

31:33.148 --> 31:35.628
Anyone else on the line?

31:35.748 --> 31:36.868
No. No, it's just me.

31:38.588 --> 31:39.908
We lost Finn, Michael.

31:41.068 --> 31:42.468
'We think Li-Na's men took him.'

31:42.588 --> 31:43.988
What?!

31:44.108 --> 31:45.308
We can't confirm it, but...

31:45.468 --> 31:47.692
You're the one in the field running the op,

31:47.693 --> 31:49.828
if you think Scott can handle
the news, you tell him.

31:49.988 --> 31:53.071
'If you think it'll compromise his
effectiveness to complete 'the mission...

31:55.028 --> 31:56.228
'It's your call.'

32:01.385 --> 32:02.534
Michael?

32:03.388 --> 32:04.988
That's a hell of a call to make.

32:06.468 --> 32:08.106
If you don't want the responsibility...

32:08.868 --> 32:10.308
No.

32:10.468 --> 32:12.508
Like you said, I'm the one in the field.

32:23.268 --> 32:24.988
Keep going.

32:25.108 --> 32:26.708
Keep going.

32:26.828 --> 32:28.228
Hey, Mike,

32:28.348 --> 32:30.428
when we got cut off from Zero,

32:30.548 --> 32:32.028
I realised something.

32:32.148 --> 32:34.948
The boss'd be used to it, but Finn?

32:35.108 --> 32:37.428
He wouldn't know whether
I was dead or alive.

32:37.588 --> 32:39.825
Pretty shitty dad to put your kid in
that spot, huh?

32:39.826 --> 32:40.987
Yeah, I hear you.

32:40.988 --> 32:42.948
We just need to stay
focused on the mission.

32:43.108 --> 32:45.228
That's a polite way of
saying, "Shut the fuck up."

32:45.388 --> 32:48.308
Oi, keep moving. We are borrowing
your limo and you are driving us

32:48.468 --> 32:50.228
to the plant one way or the other.
Let's go.

32:51.508 --> 32:53.708
Fucking bastard!

32:53.868 --> 32:57.868
That's one way. This is the other.
Let's go. Get up. Let's go. Walk.

33:29.108 --> 33:30.628
Remember.

33:30.748 --> 33:32.428
Not a word.

33:32.548 --> 33:34.508
Nice and easy.

33:34.668 --> 33:37.428
They see me drive, they
know something wrong.

33:37.548 --> 33:39.148
Do you know who I am?

33:39.308 --> 33:42.468
Yeah, you do whatever the
fuck you want to do.

33:42.588 --> 33:44.548
I'm sure you can drive your own limo.

33:53.526 --> 33:55.386
_

33:55.387 --> 33:57.160
_

34:16.068 --> 34:18.027
You go now, please!

34:18.681 --> 34:20.349
What was her name?

34:22.348 --> 34:24.063
That girl you shot.

34:24.588 --> 34:25.888
Who cares?!

34:30.148 --> 34:31.851
That was for her.

34:35.810 --> 34:38.467
- Clear, bud. Ready?
- Yeah.

34:49.308 --> 34:51.375
Mikey, going right.

35:47.868 --> 35:50.228
Oh, shit! Fuck!

36:04.388 --> 36:06.988
Fuck. Mike, they're on us.

36:13.540 --> 36:15.420
OK, feed's online.

36:15.646 --> 36:17.446
There's definite activity.

36:17.566 --> 36:20.046
Yeah, something is kicking off.

36:27.892 --> 36:30.532
Mikey! I can't keep holding them off.

36:30.750 --> 36:32.110
I need more time!

36:32.230 --> 36:33.670
Yeah, you got it.

39:28.351 --> 39:29.391
Hey.

39:30.510 --> 39:31.550
Hi.

39:31.670 --> 39:33.350
You're late.

39:33.470 --> 39:35.150
Traffic was a bitch.

39:35.270 --> 39:36.830
We need to get clear of here.

39:36.950 --> 39:38.750
All right.

39:38.910 --> 39:41.470
Hit you up a bit later. See you outside.

39:57.390 --> 39:58.790
Fire in the hole.

40:07.590 --> 40:09.150
Jesus.

40:09.310 --> 40:11.510
There are chain reactions here, and here...

41:01.750 --> 41:05.351
They did it! They actually did it.
OK, we celebrate later.

41:05.352 --> 41:07.270
Right now, we need to find Finn.

41:13.870 --> 41:18.350
- I'm not saying that we are legends, Mike.
- But you kind of are.

41:18.510 --> 41:21.030
Well, I mean, we snuck into North Korea.

41:21.150 --> 41:22.670
No back-up.

41:22.830 --> 41:24.756
Blew the shit out of Li-Na's ten-year plan.

41:24.757 --> 41:27.470
So, yeah, I am. We are fucking legends.

41:27.630 --> 41:30.230
- It's a long way to the border, mate.
- Yeah, I know.

41:32.093 --> 41:33.616
'Damien, it's me.

41:34.870 --> 41:35.990
'It's Finn.

41:37.710 --> 41:39.510
'They've kidnapped me and

41:39.511 --> 41:42.356
'they say, if you don't give yourself up...

41:43.190 --> 41:44.550
'I'm sorry!

41:46.710 --> 41:48.310
'Damien, it's me.

41:49.870 --> 41:52.230
- 'It's Finn.'
- Very smart.

41:53.390 --> 41:54.618
It's a good trick.

41:55.630 --> 41:58.430
My son is in Bangkok with
the colonel, fuckwits.

42:01.590 --> 42:03.110
'Damien, it's me.

42:04.550 --> 42:05.748
'It's Finn.

42:07.230 --> 42:09.870
'They've kidnapped me and they say...'

42:09.990 --> 42:10.950
Mike...

42:12.910 --> 42:14.552
Trick, right?

42:14.553 --> 42:16.234
- Damien...
- Mike?

42:16.235 --> 42:17.950
'Damien, it's me.'

42:19.070 --> 42:22.670
I knew there was a possibility
that he was missing.

42:25.630 --> 42:27.990
What do you mean you knew?

42:28.110 --> 42:30.390
Back at the villa.

42:30.510 --> 42:32.910
The phone call with Locke.

42:33.070 --> 42:36.630
I made a judgment call to keep
us both focused on the mission.

42:39.430 --> 42:40.950
And you knew.

42:41.070 --> 42:42.510
Since then.

42:44.556 --> 42:46.150
You should've told me, Michael.

42:46.310 --> 42:49.110
Possibility or not, you
should've fucking told me!

42:49.270 --> 42:52.070
There was nothing you
could've done to help.

42:52.190 --> 42:53.710
Really?

42:53.830 --> 42:55.790
Shit, shit.

42:55.910 --> 42:57.750
So what is this, huh?

42:57.910 --> 42:59.634
We're just gonna march up there and
hand ourselves in?

42:59.635 --> 43:00.830
No WE, Michael.

43:00.831 --> 43:02.669
This is about me and my son, not you.

43:02.670 --> 43:05.310
- We can't get caught, the implications...
- Fuck implications.

43:05.430 --> 43:06.830
Fucking act of war, mate.

43:06.990 --> 43:09.630
I was wrong, OK? I was wrong.
I made a shitty call.

43:09.750 --> 43:10.990
Yeah, and it still is.

43:11.110 --> 43:13.070
Now get the fuck out of my way, Mike!

43:13.190 --> 43:14.710
Damien...

43:14.830 --> 43:15.750
Fuck.

43:17.542 --> 43:19.110
'It's Finn.

43:20.230 --> 43:23.110
'They've kidnapped me and they say,

43:23.230 --> 43:25.670
'if you don't give yourself up...

43:25.790 --> 43:27.270
'I'm sorry!'

43:52.710 --> 43:55.270
My name is Sgt Damien Scott.

43:55.430 --> 43:57.790
