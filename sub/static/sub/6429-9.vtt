WEBVTT

00:03.010 --> 00:05.650
Is that... is that part of that
a Bell & Howell spectroscope?

00:05.860 --> 00:07.600
Surprise.
I repurposed it.

00:07.660 --> 00:09.330
Without asking me?

00:09.400 --> 00:11.000
I'm gonna say this
once. Are you listening?

00:11.060 --> 00:12.900
- Yeah.
- Back off!

00:12.960 --> 00:15.130
Just do as you're told, please.

00:15.200 --> 00:17.900
The vibes.
It happens all the time.

00:17.960 --> 00:19.530
So why do you trust them?

00:19.600 --> 00:23.900
Well, one time I didn't,
and I should have.

00:23.960 --> 00:27.660
My dad was a fireman.

00:27.730 --> 00:30.300
He died that night in a house fire,

00:30.360 --> 00:32.360
Saving a couple kids.

00:32.430 --> 00:34.750
Apparently Martino and your
partner were having an affair,

00:34.760 --> 00:36.060
And he was married.

00:36.130 --> 00:37.480
Her history doesn't bother you?

00:37.480 --> 00:41.360
I read the press release of
what went down in Denver.

00:41.430 --> 00:42.660
You're a hero.

00:42.730 --> 00:44.730
- Lives were saved.
- Lives were lost.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

01:05.900 --> 01:07.260
Want to do a shot?
...shot?

01:07.330 --> 01:09.800
Sorry, I don't drink.

01:09.860 --> 01:11.560
Sure you do.

01:11.630 --> 01:15.200
Do I know you?

01:15.260 --> 01:18.530
I haven't had a drop in five years.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.930
Probably 'cause you drank
enough for a lifetime the night

01:21.000 --> 01:23.830
You killed me... you
killed me... killed me.

01:32.400 --> 01:35.730
It was an accident.

01:37.730 --> 01:39.360
It was an accident.

01:39.430 --> 01:42.400
I was 17.
It was Prom night.

01:42.460 --> 01:45.200
I'm so... sorry. Please...

01:45.260 --> 01:46.630
Lee, what are you doing?

01:46.700 --> 01:49.300
Lee... Lee, talk to me.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.560
No, doc, I gotta... I
have to get away from her.

01:51.630 --> 01:53.130
Lee!

01:56.160 --> 01:58.830
Lee!

01:58.900 --> 02:00.330
Damn it!

02:18.700 --> 02:20.620
Myka Bering.

02:26.330 --> 02:28.330
United States Secret
Service Operations Report

02:28.330 --> 02:30.330
Final Report: 2008 Denver
Agent-Involved Shooting

02:34.660 --> 02:37.660
You're going to jail, missy!

02:40.430 --> 02:42.700
Well, better safe than sorry, right?

02:42.760 --> 02:43.900
What are you talking about?

02:43.960 --> 02:46.830
Unexplained suicides up in Riverton.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.830
We are off to see the warden.

02:49.900 --> 02:53.130
You use soap on a rope?

02:53.200 --> 02:55.960
Hey, I don't judge your
personal hygiene products.

02:56.030 --> 02:58.030
Although you might wanna invest
and get some moisturizers.

02:58.100 --> 02:59.800
You look a little dry around the nose.

02:59.860 --> 03:01.130
Oh, you want to swap beauty tips.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.830
Then we can talk about
the hair that's sprouting

03:02.900 --> 03:07.630
From your shoulders,
your nose, and your, ears!

03:09.060 --> 03:12.560
Or, you know, you could just tell
me about the prison suicides.

03:12.630 --> 03:17.160
Well, let's go with the suicides.

03:17.230 --> 03:20.430
Inventory! What a bone.

03:22.630 --> 03:26.900
Tycho Brahe's snot pocket.

03:26.960 --> 03:28.260
Check.

03:31.060 --> 03:33.600
This place is falling apart.

03:33.660 --> 03:37.230
Oh, Venus de Milo's arms.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.600
Rad.

03:39.960 --> 03:42.460
Okay, you know what

03:42.530 --> 03:45.600
I cannot work under these conditions.

03:56.160 --> 03:59.260
- What you doin'?
- Rebuilding a carburetor.

03:59.330 --> 04:01.630
That's funny. I mean,
what's the tune?

04:01.700 --> 04:03.830
Something I've been
working on for my father.

04:03.900 --> 04:06.030
Whoa.
How old is your father?

04:07.430 --> 04:09.630
No, I mean,
that's really good for you.

04:09.700 --> 04:11.430
Can I have the keys
to the cherry picker?

04:11.500 --> 04:13.400
Why? and no, you can't.

04:13.460 --> 04:14.660
I just want to fix this lightbulb.

04:14.730 --> 04:15.840
It's flickering.
It's really annoying.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.230
Just let it go, Claudia.

04:17.300 --> 04:18.399
You know,
it's just gonna burn out,

04:18.459 --> 04:19.730
And you'll have me fixing it later.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.510
Okay, here's the thing, you know,
these bulbs, they never burn out,

04:21.510 --> 04:22.760
they're Shelby bulbs.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.630
They were invented by Adolphe
Chaillet 108 years ago.

04:24.700 --> 04:27.300
So there's no need... What am
I doing even talking to you?

04:27.360 --> 04:28.730
I am busy.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.660
I... I will tighten the bulb later.

04:31.730 --> 04:34.430
Artie!

04:34.500 --> 04:36.050
Fine.

04:40.630 --> 04:42.630
Riverton Penitentiary, Florida

04:46.330 --> 04:49.260
I know you have a corner
on the whole vibe thing,

04:49.330 --> 04:51.130
But this place is creepy.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.330
Well, maybe it just
needs a woman's touch.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.460
Agents Bering and Lattimer.

04:55.530 --> 04:56.730
Sorry to keep you waiting.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.460
There's a tropical
storm headed this way,

04:58.530 --> 04:59.830
And the preparations are endless.

04:59.900 --> 05:03.000
I'm Corinne Huggins,
the warden.

05:03.060 --> 05:05.900
I'm not sure what the
Secret Service's interest is

05:05.960 --> 05:08.100
In all this, but I expect
to be kept in the loop.

05:08.160 --> 05:10.560
- Of course.
- Good. This way.

05:10.630 --> 05:13.160
Riverton hadn't had a
suicide in two years.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.200
Now, including Donaldson,

05:15.260 --> 05:16.930
We've had four in the past month.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.060
His parole had just come through, right?

05:19.130 --> 05:20.930
He had reconciled with his wife,

05:21.000 --> 05:23.230
And he was looking forward
to being with his family.

05:23.300 --> 05:24.560
Not a very high risk for suicide.

05:24.630 --> 05:26.000
None of them were.

05:26.060 --> 05:27.860
All four were model prisoners.

05:27.930 --> 05:29.500
Had anything new been brought in

05:29.560 --> 05:32.060
Before the first suicide,
furniture, artwork?

05:32.130 --> 05:34.900
Agent Lattimer, this is a
maximum-security facility,

05:34.960 --> 05:36.830
Not a college dormitory.

05:36.900 --> 05:39.700
There's been nothing
new. No woman's touch.

05:39.760 --> 05:41.330
Right. Of course.

05:41.400 --> 05:42.900
What about new inmates?

05:42.960 --> 05:45.300
There's been a freeze on intake.

05:45.360 --> 05:48.430
We've been operating over-capacity
since before I took over.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.100
- When was that?
- Just over a month ago.

05:50.160 --> 05:53.160
Just before the first suicide.

05:53.230 --> 05:56.330
I bet she's got some demonic
tchotchke on her desk

05:56.400 --> 05:58.900
That she uses as a paperweight.

06:02.100 --> 06:05.130
Okay, I take back the
"woman's touch" comment.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.360
My predecessor had been
here quite a few years.

06:07.430 --> 06:10.900
There hasn't been much time
to look at paint chips.

06:10.960 --> 06:13.530
You killed me,
killed me, Bunny.

06:13.600 --> 06:16.030
As it is, we've had to store his
things in the anteroom closet

06:16.100 --> 06:18.960
Until his estate is out of probate.

06:19.030 --> 06:20.760
Myka?

06:20.830 --> 06:23.700
Okay, this prisoner Donaldson
didn't leave a suicide note.

06:23.760 --> 06:25.930
Mind if I look through his stuff?

06:26.000 --> 06:28.530
You killed me, bunny...

06:28.600 --> 06:31.340
These are his personal effects.

06:34.430 --> 06:36.860
Coo-ell! Love that.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.160
- Ouroboros.
- Huh?

06:38.230 --> 06:39.500
It's a snake.

06:39.560 --> 06:41.460
It's a symbol of
self-reflection and cyclicity.

06:41.530 --> 06:44.730
And the best Rush album
since Roll the Bones.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.060
Snakes and arrows rocks.

06:47.130 --> 06:48.960
Written by one of our inmates.

06:49.030 --> 06:50.710
His path to salvation.

06:50.710 --> 06:52.400
Creepy.

06:52.460 --> 06:53.870
Who's John Hill?

06:56.400 --> 06:59.030
Though we're surrounded by
concrete and razor wire,

06:59.100 --> 07:02.130
I can show you more freedom
than the men who hold the keys.

07:02.200 --> 07:04.860
What's he in for?

07:04.930 --> 07:08.130
He killed his wife.
A lot.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.700
Darkness has descended on this house.

07:10.760 --> 07:12.780
Death has returned to Riverton.

07:12.780 --> 07:15.110
And those who do not learn from history

07:15.140 --> 07:16.890
Are doomed to repeat it.

07:16.900 --> 07:18.500
Dr. Cooper's ready for y'all.

07:27.930 --> 07:31.860
Regret has no place in your life.

07:31.930 --> 07:35.530
Your only salvation is here.

08:24.660 --> 08:29.430
Artie, if you won't let me use
the cherry picker, then how am I

08:25.460 --> 08:27.560
Warehouse 13 S01E10

08:37.250 --> 08:38.830
Alessandro Volta's Lab Coat

08:38.830 --> 08:40.419
Temporarily increases
biomagnetic attraction

08:40.960 --> 08:42.030
No way.

08:45.500 --> 08:49.660
What every fashionable
girl is wearing this fall.

09:12.860 --> 09:14.400
Oh, awesome!

09:14.460 --> 09:16.160
Suck it, magneto!

09:38.330 --> 09:43.130
Sweet. I can totally
see my house from here.

09:54.160 --> 09:58.030
Okay... this is mildly disconcerting.

10:13.200 --> 10:17.300
Great.
Now we know they last 108 years.

10:17.360 --> 10:20.330
Do you think freaky cult leader
are born with crazy eyes,

10:20.400 --> 10:22.600
Or is it some sort
of corrective surgery?

10:26.360 --> 10:28.000
Pete, what is it?

10:30.960 --> 10:33.100
- You don't see that?
- See what?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.900
That guy standing there.

10:45.860 --> 10:48.100
It's my dad.

10:57.100 --> 11:00.560
Uh, so, uh, Pete saw his
father, but you didn't, right?

11:00.630 --> 11:05.730
Yeah. but I should probably
mention that I saw Sam earlier.

11:05.800 --> 11:08.560
What?
Why didn't you say anything?

11:08.630 --> 11:12.060
Well, you know, Sam's dead.
And your father's dead.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.730
I mean, you can understand
my reticence, right?

11:14.800 --> 11:16.660
You're both hallucinating?

11:16.730 --> 11:18.400
And when were you gonna
mention that to me?

11:18.460 --> 11:19.960
Well, we just did.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.500
What... what was that?

11:23.560 --> 11:26.660
Tropical storminez.

11:26.730 --> 11:30.300
Uh, you didn't say
that there was a storm.

11:30.360 --> 11:31.960
Why is that important?

11:32.030 --> 11:34.930
How many times do I have to tell
you about electrical energy?

11:35.000 --> 11:36.400
It can crank up the
intensity of an artifact,

11:36.460 --> 11:37.860
I don't know, tenfold.

11:37.930 --> 11:40.860
And if an artifact is
causing these hallucinations,

11:40.930 --> 11:47.160
Then a powerful electrical charge can
make these visions seem absolutely real.

11:47.230 --> 11:48.730
Well, they seem pretty real now.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.530
All right, then listen. You're gonna have
to stay in constant contact... you got that?

11:51.530 --> 11:53.900
Constant. And I don't care if
you have nothing to report,

11:53.960 --> 11:55.960
Every hour you're gonna
call me, all right?

11:56.030 --> 11:57.430
And meanwhile you're
gonna find out everything

11:57.500 --> 12:00.560
Everything about these
inmates who killed themselves.

12:00.630 --> 12:02.150
Start with the last one,
Lee Donaldson.

12:03.700 --> 12:06.360
According to your statement, Lee
said something before he jumped.

12:06.430 --> 12:08.530
"I have to get away from
her." That's what he said.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.030
I can only think he meant Claire.

12:10.100 --> 12:13.330
That's the girl he killed
in the hit and run, right?

12:13.400 --> 12:16.950
He quit drinking, but never
forgave himself for taking a life.

12:16.950 --> 12:18.660
Guilt's a powerful thing.

12:18.730 --> 12:20.230
He was your trustee, right?

12:20.650 --> 12:22.680
More than that.
We were friends.

12:22.750 --> 12:25.050
I'm trained in recognizing
the warning signs.

12:25.110 --> 12:26.610
I don't know why I didn't see them.

12:26.680 --> 12:28.980
Did Lee have any enemies?

12:29.050 --> 12:31.150
John Hill.

12:31.210 --> 12:33.650
Riverton's self-proclaimed messiah,

12:33.710 --> 12:36.280
Leading his personal religious cult.

12:36.350 --> 12:37.910
Lee was an early convert,

12:37.980 --> 12:40.580
But after Hill started
capitalizing on the suicides,

12:40.650 --> 12:43.010
Lee saw what he really was

12:43.080 --> 12:45.550
An opportunist preying on fear.

12:45.610 --> 12:50.380
Lee got out, and Hill didn't
like losing one of his lambs.

12:50.450 --> 12:52.950
Hill may have strange religious beliefs,

12:53.010 --> 12:55.210
But he's harmless.

12:55.280 --> 12:57.310
I don't particularly
like what he has to say,

12:57.380 --> 13:02.210
But you can't deny the calming effect
it's had on some of the inmates.

13:02.280 --> 13:04.500
How are we today,
Mr. Hill?

13:04.500 --> 13:06.250
Another day above ground, warden.

13:06.310 --> 13:07.110
Another day above ground.

13:07.180 --> 13:08.580
Indeed.

13:08.650 --> 13:10.250
These are agents Bering and Lattimer.

13:10.310 --> 13:11.280
They'd like to ask you some questions.

13:11.350 --> 13:13.450
I'll be in my office.

13:13.510 --> 13:14.980
Where'd you get that necklace?

13:14.980 --> 13:18.250
Well, you could say it's...
it's always been with me.

13:18.310 --> 13:20.580
Or you could say where you got it.

13:20.650 --> 13:23.010
The object itself is of no importance.

13:23.080 --> 13:24.610
Its value lies in what it represents.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.410
And what is that?

13:26.480 --> 13:30.380
Some demand that we consume ourselves
with remorse for our supposed sin.

13:30.450 --> 13:33.810
Ouroboros reminds us
to transcend the cycle

13:33.880 --> 13:35.310
And walk the path to enlightenment.

13:35.380 --> 13:36.650
No remorse, huh?

13:36.710 --> 13:38.280
What about the path to parole?

13:38.350 --> 13:41.550
I was and am his instrument on earth.

13:41.610 --> 13:43.950
And with my hands,
it is his will

13:43.950 --> 13:46.380
And not mine that is done.

13:46.450 --> 13:53.080
To feel remorse...
is to shame god.

13:55.410 --> 14:00.450
What about those who are
remorseful? Like Donaldson.

14:00.510 --> 14:02.310
Lee's death revealed
his greater purpose.

14:02.380 --> 14:04.250
Man cannot be saved without sacrifice.

14:04.310 --> 14:07.510
Ooh, I see. Oh, that's
a neat trick, huh?

14:07.580 --> 14:09.450
Now you get to tell your boys

14:09.510 --> 14:13.280
You can protect them from
sacrifice, like Donaldson.

14:13.350 --> 14:15.520
My followers are free

14:15.520 --> 14:19.110
Because they know the way to freedom.

14:19.180 --> 14:22.010
You killed me,
killed me, bunny.

14:22.080 --> 14:23.900
The cruelest prison is the one

14:23.900 --> 14:27.750
That we build for ourselves
out of fear and regret.

14:39.950 --> 14:42.880
Sam?

14:42.950 --> 14:45.310
This isn't real.

14:45.380 --> 14:48.350
This can't... be real.

14:53.650 --> 14:55.220
Sam again?

15:00.090 --> 15:01.450
Yeah.

15:19.290 --> 15:20.410
I can't... move!

15:22.160 --> 15:24.180
Okay, no need to panic.
Just take off the coat.

15:26.070 --> 15:28.140
Can't take off the coat.
Okay, new plan.

15:28.200 --> 15:31.700
Oh,I'm so getting grounded.

15:31.770 --> 15:33.270
Incoming!

15:37.070 --> 15:39.170
Better you than me.

15:41.340 --> 15:45.070
Artie!

15:47.840 --> 15:50.900
This is the last one.

15:50.970 --> 15:52.540
What is it you're looking for?

15:52.600 --> 15:57.340
- I'm not sure. Uh, anomalies, patterns.
- Riots.

15:57.400 --> 15:58.770
That's a little specific,
but sure.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.640
No, no, look.

16:00.700 --> 16:04.800
For decades, Riverton was
known as the snake pit.

16:04.870 --> 16:07.270
Dozens of inmates went insane here.

16:07.340 --> 16:10.430
Then, in 1979,
during Hurricane David,

16:10.430 --> 16:12.770
There were uncontrollable riots.

16:12.830 --> 16:14.800
I mean,
the place almost burned down.

16:14.870 --> 16:16.260
Six months later it was closed.

16:16.260 --> 16:18.760
Reopened a year later
under warden Matthews.

16:18.830 --> 16:20.860
He was here until he died last month.

16:20.930 --> 16:22.990
So what did he do differently?

16:33.490 --> 16:37.260
Warden? Are you okay?

16:41.260 --> 16:42.430
I beg your pardon.

16:42.490 --> 16:44.230
The week is catching up with me.

16:44.290 --> 16:47.060
I was just asking what
Matthews did differently

16:47.130 --> 16:48.730
To whip this place into shape.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.760
Well, he was very religious.

16:50.830 --> 16:54.030
He instituted daily prayers.

16:54.090 --> 16:58.190
He swore it turned the place around.

16:58.260 --> 16:59.360
That's him.

17:01.890 --> 17:05.730
Hey, hey, hey.
This looks familiar.

17:05.790 --> 17:08.630
Check out what he got
rid of when he moved in.

17:08.690 --> 17:10.490
And no more riots.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.560
He wasn't a very tolerant man.

17:12.630 --> 17:15.630
Anything he thought was
pagan he had taken out.

17:15.690 --> 17:18.859
Well, let's go see the good reverend.

17:20.730 --> 17:23.630
Good-bye snakes and arrows.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.490
And that should take care of that.

17:27.560 --> 17:29.130
Warden, I had your
permission to wear that.

17:29.190 --> 17:30.990
I'm not sure I understand.
what, exactly, is the danger?

17:31.060 --> 17:34.390
I'm sorry, We can't
disclose that information.

17:34.460 --> 17:37.360
I was quite clear, you get
free reign of my institution,

17:37.430 --> 17:38.890
I get some answers.

17:38.960 --> 17:41.990
Please don't misconstrue
our silence as disrespect.

17:42.060 --> 17:44.330
It's just beyond our
authority to tell you.

17:44.390 --> 17:45.560
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure

17:45.630 --> 17:48.760
There won't be any more suicides.

17:57.230 --> 17:59.690
Cause of death,
brain hemorrhage

17:59.760 --> 18:01.560
Due to blunt-force trauma.

18:01.630 --> 18:04.330
Final report to come.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.790
You could have helped me, doctor.

18:09.860 --> 18:12.960
Lee, I'm sorry.
I tried... I did.

18:13.030 --> 18:14.890
I thought you were my friend.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.430
You ignored the warning signs.

18:17.490 --> 18:20.360
You let me die, doctor!

18:20.430 --> 18:21.560
Stop... Lee!

18:21.630 --> 18:23.960
Lee, I--I'm your friend!
I tried

18:24.030 --> 18:27.260
You killed me, doctor.

18:27.330 --> 18:29.290
Listen to me!

18:33.930 --> 18:36.590
You told me the suicides would stop.

18:36.660 --> 18:38.160
Now we have another one.

18:38.230 --> 18:39.930
Clearly you're not able to help.

18:39.990 --> 18:42.890
And you're not being truthful
with me about what's going on.

18:42.960 --> 18:44.190
I promise you, warden,

18:44.260 --> 18:45.260
We have told you
everything that we know.

18:45.330 --> 18:46.690
Oh, really?

18:46.760 --> 18:51.390
And what, exactly,
are you looking for?

18:51.460 --> 18:53.060
Well, it could be anything.

18:53.130 --> 18:57.890
Look, sometimes freaky stuff causes
other freaky stuff to happen.

19:00.730 --> 19:03.560
After the storm passes,

19:03.630 --> 19:04.930
I expect you two to be gone.

19:04.990 --> 19:09.760
I'm gonna request a federal
team of investigators.

19:11.730 --> 19:13.360
Okay, so he was here alone,

19:13.430 --> 19:15.930
And he was depressed about Donaldson.

19:15.990 --> 19:18.990
Medical examiners record
their autopsy findings.

19:19.060 --> 19:21.130
Maybe he has a recorder
around here somewhere.

19:21.190 --> 19:22.930
Right.

19:22.990 --> 19:26.060
So the... so look...
look for one.

19:29.390 --> 19:31.560
Fine. I'll do it.

19:31.630 --> 19:33.160
I'm over here.

19:33.230 --> 19:35.760
I'll do it. I'll do it.

19:42.930 --> 19:45.430
God... sorry,
I just want to look here.

19:47.390 --> 19:48.960
Hey, Myka.

19:52.790 --> 19:54.490
Okay, play it.

19:54.560 --> 19:58.160
Lee, I'm sorry.
I tried, I did.

19:58.230 --> 20:01.130
Lee, I'm sorry.
You are my friend!

20:01.190 --> 20:03.290
Okay, okay, so now he's
talking to the dead guy.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.290
But he should know
better. He's a doctor.

20:05.360 --> 20:06.590
What's that static sound?

20:06.660 --> 20:08.160
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

20:08.230 --> 20:09.890
- Play it again.
- Okay.

20:09.960 --> 20:14.130
Lee, I'm sorry.
I tried, I did.

20:14.190 --> 20:15.960
Lee, I'm sorry.
You are my friend!

20:16.030 --> 20:17.530
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

20:17.590 --> 20:20.330
It sounded like bad cell phone service.

20:20.390 --> 20:21.660
It's 10 thousand cycles per second.

20:21.730 --> 20:23.030
It could be the electrical interference

20:23.090 --> 20:24.730
That any natural material
makes when it vibrates.

20:24.790 --> 20:26.130
Okay, so where does it come from?

20:26.190 --> 20:28.060
Well, any number of
minerals or heavy metals

20:28.130 --> 20:30.790
Or it can be an artifact
that contains both.

20:30.860 --> 20:33.790
Well, just give me a
second. Just one... ah.

20:35.130 --> 20:36.830
- Does that sound familiar?
- That's it.

20:36.890 --> 20:39.880
So, Artie, We're looking for
some kind of a mineral artifact

20:39.880 --> 20:41.560
that causes hallucinations.

20:41.630 --> 20:43.560
Is that banging?

20:43.630 --> 20:45.030
Do you hear?

20:45.090 --> 20:46.560
Yeah, no, you do that.
You do that, but I...

20:46.630 --> 20:49.030
- Artie? Hello? What...
- No, I'm okay, I'm okay.

20:49.090 --> 20:50.790
I just...

20:50.860 --> 20:52.390
You know what, Artie,
we got it.

20:52.460 --> 20:53.760
Thanks.
We'll call you later.

20:53.830 --> 20:55.330
Yeah, all right.

21:02.660 --> 21:05.260
S... O...

21:05.330 --> 21:06.430
S-O-S?

21:09.660 --> 21:11.090
Claudia!

21:13.430 --> 21:16.290
Artie!

21:27.710 --> 21:31.410
Oh, hi, Artie. Hi.

21:31.480 --> 21:33.600
Huh, funny story.

21:33.600 --> 21:36.900
So I kind of, uh, tried
to fix this lightbulb,

21:36.970 --> 21:38.700
Even though you
expressly told me not to.

21:38.770 --> 21:41.070
And man,
have I learned my lesson!

21:41.140 --> 21:43.400
You're so right about this place.

21:43.470 --> 21:46.440
You just never know what to expect.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.300
Okay, you're pissed.

21:48.370 --> 21:50.340
Can we move past that part for now?

21:50.400 --> 21:52.670
And get to the part where
you get me down from here?

21:52.740 --> 21:55.770
That wouldn't be Volta's lab
coat that you're wearing?

21:55.840 --> 21:57.900
All part of the hilarious story

21:57.970 --> 22:00.570
I should really tell you when
I'm back on planet earth.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.640
The reason, Claudia that volta's
lab coat is in the warehouse

22:02.700 --> 22:06.070
Is because Volta couldn't
control its magnetic field.

22:06.140 --> 22:08.240
As you may have noticed,

22:08.300 --> 22:15.040
Each metallic object that it connects
to makes the coat stronger and stronger.

22:15.100 --> 22:19.840
That explains so much.
Thank you.

22:21.070 --> 22:22.940
My glasses!

22:23.000 --> 22:26.300
Those better not be scratched!

22:26.370 --> 22:28.840
You know,
when I was in girl scouts,

22:28.900 --> 22:31.640
We would make these little
mini metal detectors

22:31.700 --> 22:33.100
So we could hunt for gold.

22:33.170 --> 22:37.270
Most speakers are coated with a polymer
film that picks up VHF frequencies.

22:37.340 --> 22:39.470
But we never found any gold.

22:39.540 --> 22:42.070
But we did find a lot
of worthless minerals.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.300
Are you okay?

22:47.370 --> 22:49.400
Yeah. Yeah.

22:49.470 --> 22:52.900
I... I want you to know
that you can tell me things.

23:05.070 --> 23:08.140
I...

23:08.200 --> 23:11.570
I got the report about Denver.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.100
What'd it say?

23:13.170 --> 23:18.070
I don't know.
I... didn't read it.

23:18.140 --> 23:20.770
Intellectually, I know I
did everything by the book.

23:20.840 --> 23:22.470
Of course you did.

23:22.540 --> 23:23.870
You're you.

23:26.340 --> 23:29.670
What if I missed something, Pete?

23:29.740 --> 23:31.640
What if it's my fault?

23:31.700 --> 23:35.970
Myka, the only person
responsible for Sam's death

23:36.040 --> 23:39.600
Is the piece of garbage that
pulled the trigger that day.

23:39.670 --> 23:42.070
You protected the
president. That's the gig.

23:42.140 --> 23:45.370
You're a hero,
and so is Sam.

23:45.440 --> 23:46.400
Okay?

23:49.240 --> 23:51.140
- Yeah.
- Okay?

23:53.900 --> 23:55.400
That's a cool-ass science project.

23:55.470 --> 23:57.020
Yeah, it's...

23:58.940 --> 24:00.330
You know, it's...

24:05.170 --> 24:06.870
It's not working.

24:06.940 --> 24:08.370
Sounds like it's working.

24:08.440 --> 24:09.540
No, it's... it's not.

24:09.600 --> 24:12.340
It's just crackling at everything.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.470
Well, maybe there's minerals everywhere.

24:14.540 --> 24:18.700
Look, how can there be minerals.

24:18.770 --> 24:21.240
The miners' mine.

24:21.300 --> 24:24.340
They are everywhere,
including in the ground.

24:24.340 --> 24:26.670
Come on. Thank you.

24:26.740 --> 24:28.900
I'm sorry about the...

24:28.970 --> 24:31.180
Look. Quartz mines.

24:31.180 --> 24:32.610
Quartz.

24:34.370 --> 24:35.770
Do you see?

24:35.840 --> 24:38.640
This building was built
on an old quartz mine.

24:38.700 --> 24:40.340
And back then,
indigenous materials

24:40.400 --> 24:42.200
Would have been used when
building a new structure.

24:42.270 --> 24:44.070
Quartz, as in the mineral?

24:44.140 --> 24:45.870
As in hallucination inducer.

24:45.940 --> 24:48.840
As in this whole freaking
structure is one giant tuning fork.

24:48.900 --> 24:52.500
And mother nature's just banging away.

24:52.570 --> 24:54.700
Okay, now,I've got these magnets.

24:54.770 --> 24:56.070
They're attached to this thing.

24:56.140 --> 24:57.340
When I let go, they're
coming right at you.

24:57.400 --> 24:59.770
They'll stick to you
and the stuff near you.

24:59.840 --> 25:01.120
Okay, here they come.

25:06.940 --> 25:08.670
Okay, they're on.

25:08.740 --> 25:10.370
Would it have killed you to put
a warning label on these things

25:10.440 --> 25:11.740
And say what?

25:11.800 --> 25:13.400
"Only put on in case of stupid"?

25:13.470 --> 25:15.840
Oh, just bottom line this for me, Artie.

25:15.900 --> 25:18.640
- Worst-case scenario?
- Oh, why not?

25:18.700 --> 25:20.440
The entire warehouse
buckles in on itself,

25:20.500 --> 25:21.770
Crushing us both to death.

25:26.170 --> 25:29.340
Okay, yeah, I changed
my mind. Sugarcoat it.

25:29.400 --> 25:31.540
Okay, it must be the storm

25:31.600 --> 25:33.300
Because I can't get any reception.

25:33.370 --> 25:37.750
Okay, so the whole building is
causing the hallucinations, right?

25:37.750 --> 25:38.040
Right.

25:38.100 --> 25:42.100
So maybe we should start thinking
about what stopped them for 30 years.

25:42.170 --> 25:43.670
Okay, so the prison opens.

25:43.740 --> 25:45.100
- Right.
- There's a hurricane.

25:45.170 --> 25:47.570
Suddenly there's a ton of violence.

25:47.640 --> 25:49.940
The prison closes. it
reopens with a new warden,

25:50.000 --> 25:52.580
And suddenly the violence stops.

25:52.580 --> 25:54.770
Right. He dies. His
stuff goes into storage.

25:54.840 --> 25:57.310
The suicides start.
I don't know

25:58.120 --> 26:01.540
Maybe the old bible banger had
something that was curing the crazy.

26:01.600 --> 26:03.170
Right.

26:03.240 --> 26:04.440
Maybe this is what Mrs. Frederic meant

26:04.500 --> 26:06.700
By "endless freaking wonder."

26:17.500 --> 26:19.800
- Let's go.
- Yeah, let's get out of here.

26:19.870 --> 26:21.740
- Cause they're not there.
- We did not see that.

26:26.540 --> 26:29.970
- Warden? Warden Huggins?
- No!

26:30.040 --> 26:33.270
Warden, what's going on?
it's locked.

26:33.340 --> 26:35.070
- Have you got the keys?
- Stop.

26:35.140 --> 26:37.640
Stop. I'm sorry!

26:39.900 --> 26:42.170
Okay, he cuckoo for cocoa puffs.

26:42.240 --> 26:43.670
Warden Huggins,
it's agent Bering.

26:43.740 --> 26:45.370
Are you all right?

26:45.440 --> 26:46.760
Get back, Dr. Cooper!

26:48.240 --> 26:49.490
That's not true.

26:53.570 --> 26:54.540
Look out.
Let me bust the door down.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.100
But it's... it's...

26:56.170 --> 26:58.240
It's a warden's door.

26:58.300 --> 27:00.470
It's probably sturdier than most.

27:00.540 --> 27:03.670
I wish you would've said
that about five seconds ago.

27:03.740 --> 27:06.640
No, no! get away from me!

27:06.700 --> 27:09.170
That's not a good sign.

27:09.240 --> 27:11.240
We have to go through the
ex-warden's stuff in storage.

27:33.770 --> 27:35.610
You can't get this out, Corinne.

27:35.970 --> 27:37.850
You can never control this prison.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.870
How many the born of
the die when you are in

27:42.130 --> 27:45.490
I mean, how much "world's greatest
warden" crap can you have?

27:45.530 --> 27:47.160
We don't even know
what we're looking for.

27:47.230 --> 27:48.760
Why would this time be any different?

27:48.830 --> 27:49.930
Okay, look.
Give me the Farnsworth.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.060
I'm gonna try Artie again.

27:55.030 --> 27:59.560
It appears that Riverton is
now the land of the blind.

27:59.630 --> 28:02.300
And we are its one-eyed kings.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.860
Just a minute. Yeah?

28:18.930 --> 28:20.730
Artie! Artie, thank god.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.760
Okay, what shuts down quartz?

28:22.830 --> 28:24.500
Of course, it's quartz.
it's quartz, right.

28:24.560 --> 28:25.800
Yeah, that makes perfect sense.

28:25.800 --> 28:27.130
I should have.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.500
Artie...

28:28.560 --> 28:29.830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, listen.

28:29.900 --> 28:32.900
Pierre Curie and his brother Jacques,

28:32.960 --> 28:37.130
They proved the existence of a
converse effect of piezoelectricity.

28:37.200 --> 28:38.700
You know what that is,
don't you?

28:38.760 --> 28:39.960
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:40.030 --> 28:42.960
So what you've gotta do is you...

28:45.130 --> 28:47.860
Help! artie.

28:47.930 --> 28:50.860
Yeah, sorry.

28:50.930 --> 28:53.800
Okay, the frequency of a piece of quartz

28:53.860 --> 28:58.460
Can be completely cancelled out by its
proximity to a second piece of quartz.

28:58.530 --> 29:00.760
Now, the second piece is
probably what the artifact

29:00.830 --> 29:01.800
I'm having a little...

29:01.860 --> 29:03.400
With the image breaking up.

29:03.460 --> 29:05.960
It's a large piece, okay?
...Parts of...

29:06.030 --> 29:07.800
Is the storm... worse?

29:07.860 --> 29:09.230
A lot.

29:09.300 --> 29:10.630
When you find the artifact,

29:10.700 --> 29:11.860
You gotta put it exac...

29:11.930 --> 29:14.900
Exactly... before

29:14.960 --> 29:18.130
Be... proxim...
the original frequency

29:18.200 --> 29:19.930
Essential...

29:20.000 --> 29:22.600
Artie. Artie!

29:24.500 --> 29:26.830
Okay, big piece of quartz in the closet.

29:26.900 --> 29:28.460
Hey, hello. Can we
get back to me, Artie?

29:28.530 --> 29:29.930
There's a bicycle on me.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.460
We're gonna have to
reduce the magnetic field.

29:33.530 --> 29:35.600
But we're gonna do it very gradually.

29:35.660 --> 29:37.460
We have to do that just because

29:37.530 --> 29:42.560
We wouldn't want to destroy
your central nervous system.

29:42.630 --> 29:44.400
No. No, we wouldn't.
We would not.

29:47.830 --> 29:49.000
Hey, what is that?

29:49.060 --> 29:50.160
That sounds bad.
What is that?

29:53.260 --> 29:56.800
Artie! Artie?

30:03.060 --> 30:06.000
Box of crap. Box of crap.

30:09.360 --> 30:11.730
Warden, whatever you're
seeing, it's not real.

30:11.800 --> 30:13.230
You're perfectly safe.

30:16.200 --> 30:17.760
It's the cross.

30:21.360 --> 30:23.400
Claudia, new plan.

30:23.460 --> 30:25.460
But listen,
you have to do exactly...

30:25.530 --> 30:27.730
Exactly as I say.
Got that?

30:27.800 --> 30:29.430
You're the man.

30:31.730 --> 30:34.200
Stay right there.

30:34.260 --> 30:35.930
What?

30:36.000 --> 30:38.730
- Bingo!
- You found it?

30:47.700 --> 30:52.060
What is it that they say about
those who live by the sword.

31:08.500 --> 31:11.230
Stand aside, please.

31:13.330 --> 31:16.360
Is that some sort of prison
term for "you're a dead woman"?

31:16.430 --> 31:20.630
I can't take the door off its hinges
if you're standing in front of it.

31:20.700 --> 31:22.930
You really think we're just
gonna let you in there?

31:23.000 --> 31:24.300
If the prison is in an uproar,

31:24.360 --> 31:25.860
That means the warden is in trouble.

31:25.930 --> 31:31.000
She's always supported my
work. I would like to help.

31:43.460 --> 31:45.500
Wait!

32:10.200 --> 32:15.030
Target has arrived.
Repeat, target has arrived.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.960
Sam? Sam?

32:20.860 --> 32:22.530
It's happening again.

32:25.560 --> 32:27.030
You should have warned me, Petey.

32:27.100 --> 32:29.060
Dad?

32:29.130 --> 32:30.460
If you knew I was never coming home,

32:30.530 --> 32:33.000
Why didn't you say something?

32:35.660 --> 32:38.630
Repeat, target is on
the move. Let's move in.

32:38.700 --> 32:40.100
Negative. Negative.

32:40.160 --> 32:44.800
The plan is to extract at the stairs.

32:44.860 --> 32:47.000
Sam, wait!

32:49.660 --> 32:52.530
I was a kid.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.860
It was just a feeling.
I was afraid.

32:54.930 --> 32:56.760
Well, it's time to be a man,

32:56.830 --> 32:58.060
Take responsibility for your actions,

32:58.130 --> 33:01.260
Your fears, your regrets.

33:01.330 --> 33:03.460
It's your fault.
You were late.

33:03.530 --> 33:05.230
Was I?

33:05.300 --> 33:06.430
You killed me, bunny.

33:06.500 --> 33:09.160
Now you've gotta make it right.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.460
It's time to pay the price, boy.

33:12.530 --> 33:13.640
The cruelest prison is the one

33:13.640 --> 33:16.830
We build for ourselves
out of fear and regret.

33:17.470 --> 33:18.200
What?

33:20.960 --> 33:23.860
Not a day goes by that I don't miss you.

33:23.930 --> 33:27.330
But you would have gone
to work that morning

33:27.400 --> 33:30.500
Whether I would have warned you or not.

33:30.560 --> 33:32.900
- And I have no more regret...
- "Regret..."

33:32.960 --> 33:34.460
About not stopping you.

33:34.530 --> 33:37.260
- And I have no more fear...
- "Out of fear..."

33:37.330 --> 33:39.200
That I did the wrong thing.

33:39.260 --> 33:40.460
"Regret has no place in your life."

33:40.530 --> 33:43.230
It wasn't my fault.

33:43.300 --> 33:45.530
It's just it's who you were,

33:45.600 --> 33:49.800
And who I try and be
every day of my life.

33:57.360 --> 33:58.470
"The cruelest prison is the one"

33:58.470 --> 34:00.880
"That we build for ourselves..."

34:11.730 --> 34:13.830
Stay away from me, Sam!

34:17.080 --> 34:17.790
Myka.

34:18.350 --> 34:19.330
Listen to me.

34:21.280 --> 34:22.310
You can fight this.

34:24.239 --> 34:24.920
Okey?

34:25.929 --> 34:28.000
You know what happened in Denver

34:28.630 --> 34:31.400
Their planing in
preparations wasn't enough.

34:32.110 --> 34:32.880
You know the truth

34:34.429 --> 34:35.560
Don't be afraid of it.

34:40.239 --> 34:41.460
This is the report.

34:43.659 --> 34:44.610
Remeber?

34:45.670 --> 34:46.780
You know what is in it.

34:50.380 --> 34:51.550
Don't be afraid.

34:53.310 --> 34:54.989
Sam said I killed him.

34:56.409 --> 34:57.940
You know that's not the truth.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.820
Myka listen, you don't
need the report to tell you

34:59.820 --> 35:01.530
What is already know in your heart.

35:02.070 --> 35:04.670
You did everything right.

35:09.590 --> 35:11.860
Sam didn't listened to you.
That is why he is dead.

35:11.940 --> 35:13.170
He screwed up.

35:13.790 --> 35:14.760
Not you.

35:17.140 --> 35:18.240
Do you understand?

35:19.500 --> 35:20.820
Then tell Sam the truth.

35:25.920 --> 35:27.070
I am sorry Sam.

35:27.160 --> 35:29.530
Sam is not gonna bring me back bunny.

35:29.750 --> 35:31.790
I'm sorry because you made the mistake.

35:34.640 --> 35:35.490
Not me.

35:35.540 --> 35:36.470
You were late.

35:38.020 --> 35:39.100
No.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.330
No.

35:43.890 --> 35:45.460
You were early.

35:47.580 --> 35:49.940
They targeted me too when
you got yourself killed.

35:58.040 --> 35:59.620
I love you. Sam.

36:01.380 --> 36:03.220
I always will.

36:13.120 --> 36:14.950
But I have to move on.

36:18.650 --> 36:21.690
I have to move on.

36:41.080 --> 36:42.440
- You are okay?
- Getting worse. Yeah.

36:42.540 --> 36:43.330
- What we gonna do with this?
- Ok.

36:43.420 --> 36:47.840
The picture... the picture
in the old warden are

36:47.940 --> 36:49.420
So it was... there.

37:04.420 --> 37:05.560
Hurry, Artie.

37:06.290 --> 37:07.470
Good idea.

37:13.980 --> 37:16.000
What's that,
it sounds like a truck.

37:16.800 --> 37:19.060
No, it's not truck.

37:19.400 --> 37:20.370
All right. It's a truck.

37:20.650 --> 37:21.940
Wait, wait.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.060
Come on, come on.

37:38.650 --> 37:39.640
Hang on.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.300
Hey what was that for?
Get rid of the body?

37:47.600 --> 37:50.860
No.
The back up plan doesn't work.

37:51.220 --> 37:52.210
What do you mean by "doesn't work"?

38:01.890 --> 38:03.760
I don't think I'm gonna like this.

38:04.140 --> 38:05.750
Now, go.

38:07.040 --> 38:08.630
Heavens got me.

38:08.790 --> 38:11.580
Oh, Artie, don't do
this. No, please. Artie.

38:16.050 --> 38:18.730
Oh, god, I don't hope to get shoot,
please.Don't because of this.

38:18.970 --> 38:22.530
Just don't move.

38:23.730 --> 38:24.770
Ok.

38:25.200 --> 38:27.370
I promise I'll be good from now on.

38:31.500 --> 38:32.250
Grab it.

38:32.350 --> 38:33.380
Ok, I'm trying.

38:50.580 --> 38:52.050
Ultimas maximums.

38:56.800 --> 38:58.070
That was awesome!

38:58.140 --> 39:00.970
Yeah, it kinda was awesome,
wasn't it?

39:02.770 --> 39:05.200
All right,
let's get out of here.

39:05.270 --> 39:06.840
You've got to take that off right away.

39:06.900 --> 39:07.800
- Okay. Yeah.
- Now. Now.

39:11.440 --> 39:13.740
Hey. Are you hurt?

39:13.800 --> 39:15.800
No. No, I'm fine.
What happened?

39:15.870 --> 39:18.970
Well, it's a long story.
I hope you like cross.

39:19.040 --> 39:20.940
Pete!

39:21.000 --> 39:23.070
Oh, my god.

39:23.140 --> 39:24.840
Help me.

39:24.900 --> 39:26.240
What happened?

39:34.400 --> 39:37.140
Okay, okay,
he's losing a lot of blood.

39:37.200 --> 39:41.000
- We gotta get him out of here.
- No, no, no, no.

39:41.070 --> 39:44.670
It's all right.

39:44.740 --> 39:48.970
He's chosen me for sacrifice.

39:49.040 --> 39:53.600
I'm... on... a new path.

40:18.540 --> 40:21.400
How many times do I have
to write this, Artie?

40:21.470 --> 40:23.040
Okay.

40:23.100 --> 40:26.100
All right, Claudia.
All right. Okay.

40:26.170 --> 40:29.900
You know what...

40:29.970 --> 40:32.170
- No.
- Yeah.

40:32.240 --> 40:35.070
Enough of doing it that way.

40:35.140 --> 40:36.900
All right, so...

40:36.970 --> 40:43.070
Now, Claudia... Okay...

40:43.140 --> 40:45.140
Now, focus.

40:45.200 --> 40:47.800
Don't just write it.
Believe it.

40:47.870 --> 40:49.870
- No...
- Yes.

40:57.370 --> 40:59.290
I will not disobay Arite.

40:59.300 --> 41:01.800
How long you been working on that?

41:01.870 --> 41:04.070
Since I lost my father.

41:06.600 --> 41:08.600
Artie, I'm sorry.

41:08.670 --> 41:10.700
When did he die?

41:10.770 --> 41:12.170
Oh, he's alive.

41:12.240 --> 41:15.240
I just hope that finishing this

41:15.300 --> 41:17.740
Will help us find each other again.

41:32.990 --> 41:34.820
Myka.

41:36.960 --> 41:38.920
Yeah?

41:39.480 --> 41:42.410
So listen,
I'm taking the girls out

41:42.480 --> 41:44.550
For a little night on the town,

41:44.610 --> 41:47.150
You know, which, in this
part of South Dakota means

41:47.210 --> 41:50.480
Going for ice cream.

41:52.350 --> 41:54.580
You wanna come?

41:54.650 --> 41:56.250
I'm beat.

41:56.310 --> 41:58.610
All right. You want me to
bring you something back?

41:58.680 --> 42:00.080
You know I don't eat sugar.

42:00.150 --> 42:02.110
Right, butter pecan,
caramel sauce,

42:02.180 --> 42:04.450
Chocolate sprinkles.

42:11.310 --> 42:13.380
You all right?

42:13.450 --> 42:17.110
I'm good. You know...

42:17.180 --> 42:18.510
All right.

42:18.580 --> 42:22.180
Well, remember,
if you want to talk...

42:22.250 --> 42:24.480
Maybe tomorrow.

42:24.550 --> 42:26.310
I'll have my people call your people.

42:26.380 --> 42:28.950
You do that.

42:29.010 --> 42:29.950
Bye.

42:30.010 --> 42:31.810
Bye.
