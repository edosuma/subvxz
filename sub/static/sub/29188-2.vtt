Previously onWhy Women Kill...

00:11.054 --> 00:12.055
Hello.

00:12.099 --> 00:13.317
Sheila Mosconi.

00:13.361 --> 00:14.840
It was lovely to meet you.

00:14.884 --> 00:17.930
SHEILA:
Rob kissed a blonde waitress.

00:17.974 --> 00:19.106
Not Rob.

00:19.149 --> 00:20.281
Not after
what happened

00:20.324 --> 00:21.717
to our daughter.

00:21.760 --> 00:22.718
SHEILA:
Beth Ann,

00:22.761 --> 00:24.024
confront the girl.

00:24.067 --> 00:25.764
She might not even know
that Rob is married.

00:25.808 --> 00:27.592
Can I get you
some coffee to start?

00:29.507 --> 00:31.118
You look like you could use
someone to talk to,

00:31.161 --> 00:32.597
and we're slow right now.

00:32.641 --> 00:33.598
What is your name?

00:33.642 --> 00:35.252
Sheila.

00:35.296 --> 00:37.254
Tommy, what's this?

00:37.298 --> 00:39.387
I don't know, was
here when I came in.

00:40.431 --> 00:41.606
SIMONE:
Is he the only one,

00:41.650 --> 00:42.738
or have there been others?

00:42.781 --> 00:44.522
Here's what's
going to happen.

00:44.566 --> 00:46.089
You will go upstairs
to begin packing.

00:46.133 --> 00:47.830
You won't come down
until everyone's gone.

00:47.873 --> 00:49.614
Do you understand?
I will not be humiliated.

00:49.658 --> 00:51.007
What did you do?

00:51.051 --> 00:53.270
You think you're gonna
get out of this by dying?

00:53.314 --> 00:54.663
Fuck you!

00:54.706 --> 00:56.012
Tommy.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.970
I've wanted to that
since I was 13.

00:58.014 --> 00:59.494
Well, how old are you now?

00:59.537 --> 01:00.495
I'm 18.

01:00.538 --> 01:01.974
I think you should go.

01:03.715 --> 01:04.673
Hello.

01:04.716 --> 01:05.804
Hey, what's up?

01:05.848 --> 01:06.805
What?

01:06.849 --> 01:08.198
Who was that?

01:08.242 --> 01:10.505
My friend Jade--
she has this crazy ex.

01:10.548 --> 01:12.115
Oh... you fucking her?

01:12.159 --> 01:13.943
Don't be mad.About what?

01:13.986 --> 01:15.205
Jade's outside.

01:15.249 --> 01:16.206
You've become
emotionally involved.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.642
That is an insult to me

01:17.686 --> 01:19.818
and the sacred institution
known as open marriage.

01:21.168 --> 01:22.212
All right, fine, one night.

01:22.256 --> 01:23.735
I told her
she could stay the weekend.

01:23.779 --> 01:24.867
Hey.

01:24.910 --> 01:26.086
Thank you so much
for letting me stay.

01:26.129 --> 01:28.436
I really, really appreciate it.

01:28.479 --> 01:30.046
Oh.Oh, my gosh.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.221
This is crazy.

01:31.265 --> 01:32.266
I can't believe this.

01:32.309 --> 01:33.528
I'm staying with the guy
who wrote

01:33.571 --> 01:34.920
my favorite movie.

01:34.964 --> 01:37.706
If Jade needed to stay
here a couple extra weeks,

01:37.749 --> 01:39.621
it's no problem.

01:44.930 --> 01:48.934
THE OLD MAN:
I lived next door
to a nice married couple.

01:50.197 --> 01:52.982
They seemed very much in love.

01:54.940 --> 01:58.727
Until the night
someone heard gunshots,

01:58.770 --> 02:00.903
and the police were called.

02:00.946 --> 02:03.166
They said one
of those nice people

02:03.210 --> 02:05.647
had been murdered.

02:05.690 --> 02:08.954
I asked my mother how something like that could happen.

02:08.998 --> 02:11.609
All she said was,

02:11.653 --> 02:13.742
"Marriage is harder
than it looks."

02:17.485 --> 02:22.142
Years later, a rich couple
moved into that same house.

02:22.185 --> 02:24.970
I always thought
they seemed happy.

02:29.584 --> 02:32.195
Until the police came back,

02:32.239 --> 02:34.371
and I saw the body.

02:34.415 --> 02:36.417
The rumor was

02:36.460 --> 02:38.941
one of the rich people
had killed the other.

02:38.984 --> 02:41.987
I asked my fiancée
what she thought had happened.

02:43.293 --> 02:45.121
All she said was,

02:45.165 --> 02:47.428
"Death is cheaper
than divorce."

02:51.345 --> 02:54.174
Last year yet another couple

02:54.217 --> 02:58.134
came to live
in the house next door.

02:58.178 --> 03:02.094
They were young and seemed
to have so much to live for.

03:04.967 --> 03:07.012
But, sadly,

03:07.056 --> 03:10.668
I heard the sirens
one more time.

03:14.194 --> 03:17.849
I arrived at the crime scene to have my worst fears confirmed.

03:23.246 --> 03:25.335
I turned to my wife and said,

03:25.379 --> 03:28.251
"Another love story
has ended in murder.

03:28.295 --> 03:30.558
I can't believe it."

03:30.601 --> 03:33.604
My wife looked at me and said,

03:33.648 --> 03:35.650
"I can."

03:46.008 --> 03:49.054
♪ "L" is for the way you look

03:49.098 --> 03:51.883
♪ At me

03:51.927 --> 03:55.409
♪ "O" is for the only one

03:55.452 --> 03:57.237

03:58.325 --> 04:01.632

♪ Love is all

04:16.952 --> 04:18.823

04:18.867 --> 04:23.263

04:23.306 --> 04:25.613

♪ Love was made

04:31.271 --> 04:37.320
♪ For me and you...

05:20.363 --> 05:23.018
That looks delicious.

05:23.061 --> 05:26.021
You know, you're starting
to become one of my regulars.

05:26.064 --> 05:28.110
What is this, your
second time this week?

05:28.153 --> 05:29.720
My third.

05:29.764 --> 05:32.854
I'm afraid I don't have much
to occupy my days,

05:32.897 --> 05:35.247
being a lonely widow
in a new town.

05:35.291 --> 05:39.513
Sheila, you never told me that
your husband died. I'm so sorry.

05:39.556 --> 05:42.559
Don't be. It happens.
Do you have a fella?

05:42.603 --> 05:45.214
Well, um...Of course you do.

05:45.257 --> 05:48.217
You're so pretty.
What's his name?

05:48.260 --> 05:51.351
Um... Rob.

05:53.091 --> 05:54.484
Tell me about him.

05:57.008 --> 05:59.097
I-I can't. Not here.

05:59.141 --> 06:01.404
It's kind of a
complicated situation.

06:01.448 --> 06:03.928
I understand.

06:03.972 --> 06:05.974
Understand what?

06:06.017 --> 06:09.804
Clearly, you're dating
a married man.

06:11.849 --> 06:13.851
How did you know that?

06:13.895 --> 06:16.854
You used the word "complicated."
What else could it mean?

06:16.898 --> 06:18.769
Oh, u-um...

06:18.813 --> 06:22.338
Please don't tell anyone.
I'm not proud of it.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.601
Of course you're not.

06:24.645 --> 06:26.603
Don't worry.

06:26.647 --> 06:28.344
I can keep a secret.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.650
Thank you.

06:29.693 --> 06:31.739
I do have one question.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.003
Has your married man
ever told you

06:35.046 --> 06:36.744
why he feels the need to cheat?

06:36.787 --> 06:39.529
Uh... what?

06:39.573 --> 06:41.923
M-My husband had an affair,

06:41.966 --> 06:45.187
but he died
before I could find out why.

06:45.230 --> 06:46.884
Naturally, I'm curious.

06:46.928 --> 06:50.018
I'm... sure it was a
completely different situation.

06:50.061 --> 06:52.542
Or maybe it was
exactly the same. Who knows?

06:52.586 --> 06:55.023
Has Rob said anything?Not really, no.

06:55.066 --> 06:58.461
I assume it's just the obvious:
he was bored with his wife.

06:58.505 --> 06:59.897
Bored?

06:59.941 --> 07:01.203
MAN:
Check, please.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.902
You know how
housewives can be.

07:04.946 --> 07:06.817
They forget that their
husbands need more

07:06.861 --> 07:08.776
than hot meals
and clean socks.

07:08.819 --> 07:11.735
Men want excitement
and passion.

07:11.779 --> 07:13.998
Lots of women just forget to
put in that kind of an effort.

07:14.042 --> 07:15.696
They don't change
their hair.

07:15.739 --> 07:18.046
They always wear the
same dowdy clothes.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.266
Oh.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.617
Can I get you anything else?No.

07:23.660 --> 07:27.664
You've already given me
more than enough to chew on.

07:36.673 --> 07:38.022
Oh, hello.

07:38.066 --> 07:39.676
How long have
you been here?

07:39.720 --> 07:41.330
About an hour or so.

07:41.373 --> 07:42.679
How are you feeling?

07:42.723 --> 07:45.203
Eh. You know,
it's funny.

07:45.247 --> 07:48.903
You, uh, you attempt suicide
with a bottle of sleeping pills,

07:48.946 --> 07:52.123
and when you finally
wake up, they sedate you.

07:52.167 --> 07:54.474
God, what were you thinking?

07:54.517 --> 07:57.302
Look, I was ashamed
of the pain I had caused.

07:57.346 --> 07:59.217
And you thought your death
would cause me less pain?

07:59.261 --> 08:01.089
It was stupid and selfish.
I'm sorry.

08:01.132 --> 08:03.091
Well, just tell me
you won't try it again.

08:03.134 --> 08:05.223
I won't.Say it.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.966
I won't try
and kill myself again.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.491
Good.

08:13.101 --> 08:15.582
The doctors say
you can go home this afternoon.

08:15.625 --> 08:17.453
Well, that's your
call, not theirs.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.063
Can I come home?

08:19.107 --> 08:21.370
Well, I've thought about it--
I still want a divorce.

08:21.413 --> 08:23.590
But there's no need
to rush things.

08:23.633 --> 08:25.679
You can stay at the house,
and then after a while,

08:25.722 --> 08:26.723
we'll separate.

08:26.767 --> 08:27.768
Amicably.

08:27.811 --> 08:28.986
Charmingly.

08:29.030 --> 08:31.467
Charmingly?I want people to envy

08:31.511 --> 08:33.861
our divorce the same way
they envied our marriage.

08:33.904 --> 08:36.080
God forbid our friends
should ever pity you.

08:36.124 --> 08:39.257
Our friends don't feel pity,
only schadenfreude.

08:40.476 --> 08:42.478
And when would we separate?

08:42.522 --> 08:44.262
Oh, sometime in July.

08:45.307 --> 08:46.656
Ah.

08:46.700 --> 08:49.006
After your daughter's wedding.

08:49.050 --> 08:50.486
We've been planning all year
to make sure

08:50.530 --> 08:52.183
every detail is perfect.

08:52.227 --> 08:53.750
And why upstage her?

08:53.794 --> 08:55.622
Exactly. You love Amy
as much as I do.

08:55.665 --> 08:58.102
You wouldn't want to ruin
her special day with a divorce.

08:58.146 --> 08:59.016
No.

08:59.060 --> 09:00.104
Or a scandal.

09:00.148 --> 09:01.584
Of course not.

09:01.628 --> 09:03.325
Or a suicide.

09:03.368 --> 09:04.805
Oh, for God's sake, Simone!

09:04.848 --> 09:06.850
Sorry, darling, but with
what I've spent on this wedding,

09:06.894 --> 09:08.635
I had to make sure.

09:08.678 --> 09:10.550
JADE:
Guys.

09:10.593 --> 09:12.552
You don't need to wait on me.No, no, no.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.031
No. You are our guest.

09:14.075 --> 09:15.859
And you're recovering
from a traumatic event.

09:15.903 --> 09:18.035
I'm not worried
about Duke anymore.

09:18.079 --> 09:19.646
He stopped texting me.

09:19.689 --> 09:20.995
ELI:
So, what's his deal?

09:21.038 --> 09:22.736
Is he crazy?A little.

09:22.779 --> 09:25.042
He was always accusing me
of cheating on him.

09:25.086 --> 09:26.870
Of course, I was,

09:26.914 --> 09:29.046
but I would have
appreciated a little trust.

09:30.526 --> 09:32.484
Did Duke know about you two?

09:32.528 --> 09:35.400
Sure, yeah. Mostly
because of how we met.

09:35.444 --> 09:37.054
ELI:
Okay, come on.

09:37.098 --> 09:38.708
How did you meet?

09:38.752 --> 09:40.449
You never told him the story?

09:40.492 --> 09:42.756
Well, we don't usually share
stories about our playmates.

09:42.799 --> 09:43.800
ELI:
Share,

09:43.844 --> 09:44.845
just this once.

09:46.107 --> 09:47.804
Okay.

09:47.848 --> 09:50.633
I was selling lingerie
at Agent Provocateur.

09:50.677 --> 09:53.331
Solid opening scene. Go on.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.203
Well, I was there
to buy a few bras.

09:55.246 --> 09:56.596
Red lace?No.

09:56.639 --> 09:57.771
The kind Ilike.

09:57.814 --> 09:59.250
Oh.

09:59.294 --> 10:02.166
So, I was in the fitting room
taking my top off

10:02.210 --> 10:04.560
when the zipper
gets caught in my hair.So she sticks her head out

10:04.604 --> 10:06.475
and is all...

10:06.518 --> 10:09.043
"Can you come in
here for a sec?"Mm-hmm.

10:09.086 --> 10:10.435
What are you doing?

10:11.480 --> 10:13.003
Nothing.

10:13.047 --> 10:15.310
You had your eyes closed.

10:15.353 --> 10:16.920
Yeah, I'm just trying
to picture it.

10:16.964 --> 10:18.792
Don't. It's pervy.

10:18.835 --> 10:21.229
Okay. Uh, so, what happened

10:21.272 --> 10:23.361
after you helped my wife
out of her sweater,

10:23.405 --> 10:25.059
he asked in a non-pervy way.

10:25.102 --> 10:26.451
We did it.

10:26.495 --> 10:29.541
Right there in
the fitting room.

10:29.585 --> 10:31.282
ELI:
Sex in a fitting room.

10:31.326 --> 10:32.806
Bravo.
That was just...

10:32.849 --> 10:34.503
Bravo.

10:34.546 --> 10:36.505
And I am
so gonna close my eyes later.

10:36.548 --> 10:37.767
Anyway, that was

10:37.811 --> 10:40.596
six months ago, and
we're still together.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.119
Six months?

10:42.163 --> 10:43.904
Yeah.

10:43.947 --> 10:47.864
Uh, you told me that you met
Jade just a few weeks ago.

10:47.908 --> 10:50.693
I'm pretty sure
I said "months."

10:50.737 --> 10:53.000
No. No.

10:53.043 --> 10:55.089
You absolutely did not.

10:57.134 --> 10:59.223
Well, obviously
I made a mistake.

10:59.267 --> 11:00.703
Who wants dessert?

11:00.747 --> 11:02.705
I got fortune cookies.Actually,
I was hoping

11:02.749 --> 11:04.446
we could jump
in the hot tub.

11:05.490 --> 11:06.666
Were you?

11:06.709 --> 11:08.668
If it's okay with you guys.

11:09.712 --> 11:10.844
Um...

11:10.887 --> 11:12.454
I don't know.Yeah, you know what?

11:12.497 --> 11:15.152
I'm not really in the mood
for cookies.

11:15.196 --> 11:17.372
Why don't I run down to
that pie shop you like,

11:17.415 --> 11:19.940
pick up some pecan?

11:19.983 --> 11:21.593
You guys... get in the hot tub,

11:21.637 --> 11:23.552
have a nice little soak
until I get back.

11:23.595 --> 11:24.814
That sounds amazing.

11:24.858 --> 11:26.294
Doesn't that sound amazing?

11:26.337 --> 11:28.426
Yeah, you don't mind?

11:28.470 --> 11:30.472
Not at all.

11:58.413 --> 12:00.154
♪ Boom, boom, boom, yeah, yeah

12:00.197 --> 12:01.808

Honey, I'm home.

12:37.234 --> 12:39.236
Where are you?

12:41.586 --> 12:43.588
I'm right here, darling.

12:52.162 --> 12:54.164
I've missed you.

12:55.557 --> 12:57.559
Is dinner ready?

12:58.603 --> 13:01.258
Uh... not yet.

13:01.302 --> 13:03.260
I've had a
hell of day.

13:03.304 --> 13:05.219
I'm gonna go fix myself a drink.

13:05.262 --> 13:06.873
Let me know when
food's on the table.

13:14.489 --> 13:16.883
So you had a rough day?

13:16.926 --> 13:18.667
The worst.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.451
My best engineer quit today,

13:20.495 --> 13:23.019
my secretary called in sick,
and on top of all that,

13:23.063 --> 13:24.891
I took my boss's briefcase

13:24.934 --> 13:26.283
home by mistake.

13:26.327 --> 13:27.632
I hope

13:27.676 --> 13:29.243
your day was better than mine.

13:29.286 --> 13:32.855
Well, now that you ask...

13:32.899 --> 13:34.988
I had a lovely day.

13:35.031 --> 13:37.381
Oh?Yes.

13:37.425 --> 13:40.558
I... bought a new dress.

13:40.602 --> 13:41.864
Did you?

13:41.908 --> 13:43.779
Yeah.

13:47.914 --> 13:50.046
That the dress?

13:50.090 --> 13:52.005
It is.

13:53.528 --> 13:54.746
What do you think?

13:54.790 --> 13:56.836
It's nice.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.056
Just nice?

14:00.100 --> 14:01.928
It...

14:01.971 --> 14:03.930
cost a whole week's allowance.

14:03.973 --> 14:05.932
Why would you spend that much
on a dress?

14:05.975 --> 14:09.283
I wanted to look pretty.

14:09.326 --> 14:11.285
For you.

14:11.328 --> 14:12.895
Oh.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.766
Well...

14:14.810 --> 14:17.291
thanks.

14:21.556 --> 14:23.079
What's wrong?I don't understand.

14:23.123 --> 14:25.516
It has been years
since I bought a new dress.

14:25.560 --> 14:28.389
And I got my nails done,
a-and I got a new hairdo.

14:28.432 --> 14:30.478
How could you not notice?Oh.

14:30.521 --> 14:32.697
Well, to be honest,
I never notice stuff like that.

14:32.741 --> 14:35.700
Why not?'Cause when I look
at you, I don't see

14:35.744 --> 14:37.093
clothes or hair.

14:37.137 --> 14:40.575
I just see you--
the girl I married.

14:40.618 --> 14:41.968
Is that so?

14:42.011 --> 14:43.708
Yeah. I don't expect you

14:43.752 --> 14:45.101
to be chic or stylish.

14:45.145 --> 14:46.624
You're my wife.

14:46.668 --> 14:50.106
I just need you
to be the... same old Beth.

15:34.107 --> 15:36.109
What the hell?

15:36.152 --> 15:38.241
If you're not going
to notice what I'm wearing,

15:38.285 --> 15:40.504
why should I bother
to wear anything at all?

15:42.463 --> 15:44.160
Honey.

15:44.204 --> 15:46.423
You want
to see the same old Beth?

15:46.467 --> 15:48.991
Fine. Here she is
in all her glory.

15:49.035 --> 15:51.733
Honey!

16:01.699 --> 16:03.658
Why is your boss here?

16:03.701 --> 16:07.096
He probably came
to get his briefcase.

16:11.057 --> 16:13.668
Could you give me a moment
before you open the door?

16:13.711 --> 16:16.323
Definitely.

16:31.251 --> 16:33.253
Simone!

16:38.084 --> 16:40.912
I would prefer
you call me Mrs. Grove.

16:40.956 --> 16:42.566
At least in public.

16:42.610 --> 16:45.700
You got it... Mrs. Grove.

16:45.743 --> 16:47.919
My mom asked me to bring
you these get-well muffins.

16:47.963 --> 16:50.357
Oh, that was nice of her.Yeah, not really.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.489
She just wanted me to find out
what happened to Mr. Grove.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.665
Well, you know what happened.And I'm not telling her.

16:54.709 --> 16:56.885
So I guess it's kind
of a waste of muffins.

16:56.928 --> 17:00.236
But I can still carry them in
the house for you if you'd like.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.846
No, thank you.

17:07.896 --> 17:09.724
Come on, Simone!

17:14.511 --> 17:16.252
Tommy, that kiss
we shared was sweet,

17:16.296 --> 17:18.080
but it was not a down payment.

17:18.124 --> 17:21.431
Look, if you don't find me
attractive, then just say so.

17:21.475 --> 17:23.955
I find you
alarmingly attractive,

17:23.999 --> 17:26.654
but there are
other considerations.

17:26.697 --> 17:28.090
Like what?

17:28.134 --> 17:29.787
Your mother is my best friend.

17:29.831 --> 17:31.920
So?So it would be

17:31.963 --> 17:34.227
an absolute betrayal
to sleep with her child.

17:34.270 --> 17:35.706
I'm not a child.

17:35.750 --> 17:38.144
I've grown up, and I-I've
learned some things.

17:38.187 --> 17:41.103
Like... how to take care
of a woman's needs.

17:41.147 --> 17:45.673
Just give me a chance to show
you the man that I've become.

17:46.935 --> 17:48.893
That was a lovely speech, Tommy.

17:48.937 --> 17:50.765
Next time try it
without the skateboard.

17:56.031 --> 17:59.252
God. Isn't this magical?

18:01.254 --> 18:04.605
Well... it's certainly nice.

18:04.648 --> 18:06.955
Nice?!

18:06.998 --> 18:09.914
You have no idea the kinds
of places I grew up in.

18:09.958 --> 18:11.612
When I was a kid, I thought

18:11.655 --> 18:14.049
that houses like this
only existed on TV.

18:14.093 --> 18:17.270
You never talk
about your childhood.

18:17.313 --> 18:20.664
Yeah, yeah, that's
'cause it was shitty.

18:20.708 --> 18:24.190
It was just bouncing
between foster homes

18:24.233 --> 18:26.583
with parents who only saw me

18:26.627 --> 18:28.846
as another check
from the government.

18:31.762 --> 18:35.331
But you make me feel
like I'm worth something.

18:35.375 --> 18:37.551
So...

18:37.594 --> 18:39.596
yeah, that's really magical.

18:40.641 --> 18:42.643
I guess it is.

18:42.686 --> 18:44.166
Yeah, it is.

18:44.210 --> 18:45.602
Is it?

18:45.646 --> 18:47.082
ELI:
Hey, guys.

18:48.214 --> 18:49.606
Ooh!

18:49.650 --> 18:51.042
Ooh, that's hot.

18:51.086 --> 18:52.870
Wow.

18:52.914 --> 18:54.698
Eli...
So funny.

18:54.742 --> 18:56.700
I was on my way to the bakery,
and I remembered

18:56.744 --> 18:58.572
we still have that pie
in the fridge.

18:58.615 --> 19:00.008
I'm so dumb.

19:00.051 --> 19:02.228
You're also naked. Why?

19:02.271 --> 19:03.925
Am I the only one?

19:03.968 --> 19:06.971
Oh, gosh, that's awkward.

19:08.190 --> 19:09.452
Well, of course, there are

19:09.496 --> 19:11.367
two ways to fix this situation.

19:11.411 --> 19:13.630
I could put on a suit, or...

19:13.674 --> 19:15.328
Inside.What?

19:15.371 --> 19:16.807
Inside... now.

19:16.851 --> 19:18.592
Oh, there we go. Steady.

19:18.635 --> 19:19.941
Use my arm.

19:19.984 --> 19:22.422
It's very kind of you
to help me like this.

19:22.465 --> 19:23.814
Oh, here, sit.

19:23.858 --> 19:25.686
Oh. Oh, dear. Hang on.

19:25.729 --> 19:28.950
Oh. There we are.

19:28.993 --> 19:30.908
So, um...

19:30.952 --> 19:33.781
Shall we begin?

19:33.824 --> 19:36.523
Begin what?The conversation.

19:36.566 --> 19:38.655
You-you must have
questions for me.

19:38.699 --> 19:42.093
When did I know I was gay?
How many men have I been with?

19:42.137 --> 19:44.270
Karl, please.
I just had lunch.

19:44.313 --> 19:46.097
You're not curious?

19:46.141 --> 19:47.708
Not in the slightest.

19:47.751 --> 19:49.884
And if this arrangement
is going to work,

19:49.927 --> 19:52.408
you can't bring up topics
that will upset me.

19:52.452 --> 19:53.931
But we need to talk about this

19:53.975 --> 19:55.455
if we're to have any sort
of rapprochement.

19:55.498 --> 19:57.457
What do you mean?We've been married

19:57.500 --> 19:58.936
for ten years, Simone.

19:58.980 --> 20:00.808
You can't say
we haven't been happy.

20:00.851 --> 20:03.550
No, I can't.

20:05.987 --> 20:07.945
I'm glad you know the truth.

20:07.989 --> 20:10.252
Now we can deal with
it, come to some sort

20:10.296 --> 20:13.124
of understanding, and...

20:13.168 --> 20:15.475
maybe we could
be happy again?

20:16.780 --> 20:18.869
Darling, I'm not ready
to discuss this yet.

20:18.913 --> 20:21.568
I've moved your things
into the guest room.

20:21.611 --> 20:24.397
I don't want anyone to know that
we're staying in separate beds.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.225
Especially not my daughter.

20:26.268 --> 20:27.704
I understand.

20:28.749 --> 20:30.316
Where are you going?

20:30.359 --> 20:31.926
Oh, I-I felt
a little chilly.

20:31.969 --> 20:34.189
I wanted to get
my cashmere throw.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.060
Oh, well, I'll get it for you.

20:36.104 --> 20:37.453
Sit down.Thank you.

20:37.497 --> 20:39.150
Don't be silly.

20:40.195 --> 20:42.197
You're very kind, darling.

21:03.610 --> 21:06.177
You son of a bitch!

21:15.796 --> 21:17.928
All right, um,
if you'll just let me explain.

21:17.972 --> 21:19.452
Shut up. I'm counting pills.Yes, I...

21:19.495 --> 21:21.976
I-I admit I may...
I may have dropped a few.

21:23.804 --> 21:26.067
There are over 40 pills here.

21:26.110 --> 21:27.634
You said you swallowed
the whole bottle.

21:27.677 --> 21:30.201
How many did you really take?
Two? Three?

21:30.245 --> 21:31.594
They pumped my stomach.

21:31.638 --> 21:32.987
I'm not paying for that.

21:33.030 --> 21:35.032
Not when a good burp
would have saved you.

21:38.819 --> 21:40.777
And where's your cane?

21:40.821 --> 21:42.866
Shit.

21:42.910 --> 21:45.216
Please understand.

21:45.260 --> 21:47.218
I was trying to
prove I love you.

21:47.262 --> 21:49.525
By faking a suicide attempt?

21:49.569 --> 21:51.745
You don't respond
to small gestures!

21:51.788 --> 21:53.399
I'm going to work out.

21:53.442 --> 21:55.357
If you and your things
are not out of this house

21:55.401 --> 21:57.446
by the time I get home,
I will call the police.

21:57.490 --> 21:59.013
Where am I supposed to go?

21:59.056 --> 22:00.275
I don't care!

22:00.319 --> 22:01.842
Well, maybe I'll go to Naomi's.

22:03.583 --> 22:05.672
Yes. Uh,
sh-she has a guest room.

22:05.715 --> 22:07.761
Maybe she'll ply me with liquor

22:07.804 --> 22:09.850
and get me
to spill all my lurid secrets.

22:10.894 --> 22:12.853
And why would you do that?

22:12.896 --> 22:15.116
You're the one
who kept your sex life hidden.

22:15.159 --> 22:16.639
I was married.

22:16.683 --> 22:18.598
If you kick me to the curb,

22:18.641 --> 22:20.904
I'll have no reason
notto come out.

22:20.948 --> 22:25.300
And then you, my love, will
be another Grace Belknap.

22:26.693 --> 22:28.869
Remember Grace?

22:28.912 --> 22:30.653
Are you threatening me?

22:30.697 --> 22:33.003
Yes, her husband ran off
with their carpenter, I believe.

22:33.047 --> 22:34.657
Oh, your friends were so catty.

22:34.701 --> 22:36.224
For God's sake, Karl...

22:36.267 --> 22:38.400
But you were the
cruelest of all, Simone.

22:38.444 --> 22:39.967
"Oh, poor Grace.

22:40.010 --> 22:42.448
"I suppose her carpenter
wasn't the only one

22:42.491 --> 22:44.232
with a stud finder."

22:44.275 --> 22:45.842
Oh, I imagine

22:45.886 --> 22:48.584
those women would relish
the poetic justice

22:48.628 --> 22:50.717
if you wound up
in the same boat.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.719
Why are you doing this?

22:52.762 --> 22:56.375
I am fighting
for our future happiness.

22:56.418 --> 22:58.420
By blackmailing me.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.857
Well, like I said...

23:00.901 --> 23:03.382
you don't respond
to small gestures.

23:11.215 --> 23:13.130
What do you think you're doing?

23:13.174 --> 23:14.436
What do you mean?

23:14.480 --> 23:15.872
You own swim trunks, Eli,
multiple pairs.

23:15.916 --> 23:18.440
So why did Jade and I
just get a face full of ass?

23:18.484 --> 23:20.224
Well...I'll tell you why.

23:20.268 --> 23:22.531
You thought if you left Jade
and I alone to get comfortable,

23:22.575 --> 23:24.533
we'd get a little loose,
a little frisky,

23:24.577 --> 23:26.143
and then you
could just slide right in

23:26.187 --> 23:28.058
and the three of us
would fuck the night away.

23:29.103 --> 23:31.453
That may have been
on my wish list, yes.

23:31.497 --> 23:33.020
Solid plan.

23:33.063 --> 23:34.848
Not gonna happen.

23:34.891 --> 23:36.850
Okay. Okay.

23:40.462 --> 23:41.898
But what if it did?

23:41.942 --> 23:43.422
I mean, think about it.

23:43.465 --> 23:44.901
We like sex with each other.

23:44.945 --> 23:46.468
We like sex
with hot women.

23:46.512 --> 23:47.904
It's one of the reasons
we work as a couple.

23:47.948 --> 23:49.384
We've got so much in common.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.559
That's fine for us.

23:50.603 --> 23:51.995
But what about Jade?Oh, I'm...

23:52.039 --> 23:52.996
I'm pretty sure
she's into me.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.128
What? Why?

23:54.171 --> 23:55.608
The other day,
she was going on and on

23:55.651 --> 23:57.392
about how much
she liked my movie.

23:57.436 --> 23:58.741
I liked The Shining.

23:58.785 --> 24:00.874
That doesn't mean
I want to fuck Stephen King.

24:00.917 --> 24:03.311
Okay, all right.
Well, well, if you're not sure

24:03.354 --> 24:05.139
that she'd be into it,

24:05.182 --> 24:06.967
ask her.

24:07.968 --> 24:09.622
No, it'd be weird.

24:09.665 --> 24:10.884
Weird how?

24:10.927 --> 24:12.320
Like, I don't know

24:12.363 --> 24:14.627
if she's that adventurous.

24:14.670 --> 24:17.194
She fucked you
in a fitting room!

24:17.238 --> 24:19.936
Okay.
It would be weird for us.

24:19.980 --> 24:21.808
We've never done anything
like this before.

24:21.851 --> 24:24.158
No, it doesn't have
to be a big deal.

24:24.201 --> 24:26.377
No, we-we've already
got an open marriage.

24:26.421 --> 24:29.337
Why can't it be open to Jade?

24:32.079 --> 24:33.776
Fine.

24:33.820 --> 24:36.039
I'll ask her for a three-way.

24:36.083 --> 24:37.780
Will that shut you up?

24:37.824 --> 24:40.522
I think you know it will.

24:40.566 --> 24:42.132
Okay, but we won't pressure her.

24:42.176 --> 24:43.394
No. No, no.

24:43.438 --> 24:44.831
I will take her aside,
I will ask respectfully,

24:44.874 --> 24:46.267
and if she says no...Mm-hmm.

24:46.310 --> 24:48.748
She says yes.

24:53.796 --> 24:56.190
You two coming or what?

25:07.506 --> 25:09.812
His boss saw your tits?

25:09.856 --> 25:11.684
Don't make it sound
worse than it was.

25:11.727 --> 25:13.381
I'm not sure I could.

25:13.424 --> 25:14.861
I was so angry.

25:14.904 --> 25:16.471
I changed my whole look.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.212
Rob did not even notice.

25:18.255 --> 25:20.170
Here's my two cents,
all right?

25:20.214 --> 25:21.563
Spend them wisely.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.739
Rob isn't cheating on you
because you don't wear

25:23.783 --> 25:25.567
the latest styles from Paris.

25:25.611 --> 25:27.003
What do you mean?

25:27.047 --> 25:29.179
Ma! Mikey hit me.

25:29.223 --> 25:30.267
What am I, your bodyguard?

25:30.311 --> 25:31.573
Hit him back.

25:33.314 --> 25:35.446
So what I mean is,

25:35.490 --> 25:37.666
how is your love life?

25:37.710 --> 25:40.016
Are you doing everything
you can to keep him interested?

25:40.060 --> 25:41.191
Sheila.

25:41.235 --> 25:43.803
Sometimes old dogs
need new tricks.

25:43.846 --> 25:45.500
New tricks?

25:45.544 --> 25:47.981
I was a virgin
on my wedding night.

25:48.024 --> 25:50.940
I only know what Rob
was willing to teach me.

25:52.420 --> 25:55.641
There's a book
that you should read.

25:57.991 --> 25:59.470
What is this?

25:59.514 --> 26:00.602
It's a manual.

26:00.646 --> 26:02.561
For married couples.

26:04.911 --> 26:06.390
These are dirty pictures!

26:06.434 --> 26:07.696
They're illustrations.

26:07.740 --> 26:09.480
They're scientific.

26:10.525 --> 26:11.961
Why do you have this?

26:12.005 --> 26:14.964
There was a time
that Leo and I felt

26:15.008 --> 26:18.228
ourlove life needed
a little zing.

26:18.272 --> 26:20.143
And you actually do
these things?

26:20.187 --> 26:22.276
You see page 76?

26:23.320 --> 26:24.452
Yes.

26:24.495 --> 26:26.193
That's how we got Benny.

26:28.151 --> 26:29.370
Oh, dear.

26:29.413 --> 26:31.764
Yeah. That's not
for beginners.

26:31.807 --> 26:33.200
Let's go back a few chapters.

26:33.243 --> 26:36.029
Ah. That's a classic.

26:36.072 --> 26:39.032
We like to do that
in the shower.

26:39.075 --> 26:40.860
You've done that to Leo?

26:40.903 --> 26:41.861
That's...

26:41.904 --> 26:43.993
how I got my Pontiac.

26:44.037 --> 26:47.606
And you really think
Rob will like these things?

26:48.650 --> 26:49.956
I do.

26:49.999 --> 26:51.174
And...

26:51.218 --> 26:54.003
I won't feel humiliated after?

26:54.047 --> 26:57.833
Sex is how women
gain power over men.

26:57.877 --> 27:01.620
And there is nothing
humiliating about that.

27:05.711 --> 27:06.668
Jumping jacks!

27:06.712 --> 27:09.062
Two, three, four,

27:09.105 --> 27:12.195
five, six,
seven, eight...

27:12.239 --> 27:16.025
Simone, I've never seen you
work out so fiercely.

27:16.069 --> 27:18.854
I began to wonder if maybe
you're upset about something.

27:18.898 --> 27:20.377
Not at all.

27:20.421 --> 27:22.771
Just burning off
the muffins you sent.

27:22.815 --> 27:24.033
So, Karl's home?

27:24.077 --> 27:25.905
Yes.

27:26.906 --> 27:29.299
And everything's fine?

27:29.343 --> 27:31.214
Yes.

27:31.258 --> 27:32.955
Why do you ask?

27:32.999 --> 27:34.565
It's just...

27:34.609 --> 27:37.873
Wanda left the most cryptic
message on my answering machine.

27:37.917 --> 27:40.049
Before she left for rehab.

27:40.093 --> 27:42.225
She intimated that you
and Karl were having

27:42.269 --> 27:44.401
some sort
of marital problems.

27:44.445 --> 27:47.100
Oh, we're fine, Naomi.

27:47.143 --> 27:48.623
Now, if you'll excuse me.

27:48.667 --> 27:51.278
Simone, please.

27:51.321 --> 27:52.758
You don't have to pretend.

27:52.801 --> 27:54.368
Not with me.

27:54.411 --> 27:56.022
I wasn't surprised.

27:56.065 --> 27:59.721
I've known for some time
about Karl's indiscretions.

27:59.765 --> 28:02.637
: I don't know
what you've heard...

28:02.681 --> 28:03.769
I didn't hear.

28:03.812 --> 28:06.685
I saw with my own eyes.

28:07.729 --> 28:09.688
What exactly did you see?

28:09.731 --> 28:12.386
I-I was picking up
my dry cleaning one day,

28:12.429 --> 28:13.648
and there was his car,

28:13.692 --> 28:16.782
parked across the street
at some seedy motel.

28:21.656 --> 28:24.006
So you know everything.

28:24.050 --> 28:25.660
I do.

28:25.704 --> 28:29.316
I mean, I couldn't tell you
who the woman was, but...

28:30.360 --> 28:32.972
The woman?

28:33.015 --> 28:34.321
I wanted to catch him
in the act,

28:34.364 --> 28:35.888
but I couldn't just stand there
all day,

28:35.931 --> 28:38.673
waiting for him
and his floozy to come out.

28:38.717 --> 28:42.111
So you have no idea
who he was with?

28:42.155 --> 28:43.722
No.

28:48.161 --> 28:49.205
Do you?

28:49.249 --> 28:51.294
Oh, Naomi.

28:51.338 --> 28:53.514
I really do have to go.

28:54.558 --> 28:56.517
The important thing is,

28:56.560 --> 28:59.825
is that you finally know
the truth.

28:59.868 --> 29:01.174
"Finally"?

29:02.915 --> 29:05.091
How long ago did this happen?

29:05.134 --> 29:06.440
I don't know.

29:06.483 --> 29:07.571
Year ago.

29:07.615 --> 29:08.921
Maybe two.

29:08.964 --> 29:12.446
You knew my husband
was cheating for two years

29:12.489 --> 29:14.013
and you said nothing?

29:14.056 --> 29:15.492
Wives always say
they'd want to know

29:15.536 --> 29:16.885
if their husbands were cheating,

29:16.929 --> 29:19.192
but they never forgive
the person who tells them.

29:19.235 --> 29:20.889
But you're my best friend.

29:20.933 --> 29:23.370
And you're... one of mine.

29:25.067 --> 29:27.678
I'm so glad we had this talk.

29:36.165 --> 29:37.558
You still want
to make love to me?

29:37.601 --> 29:39.255
Yeah.

29:39.299 --> 29:40.604
I'm free today at 4:00.

29:40.648 --> 29:41.692
Great.

29:41.736 --> 29:43.129
Where should we go?

29:43.172 --> 29:45.348
You're a man now.
Figure it out.

29:56.359 --> 29:58.405
Hi there.

29:58.448 --> 29:59.972
You're home early.

30:00.015 --> 30:01.190
I have a business dinner.

30:01.234 --> 30:02.975
I wanted to come home
and shower first.

30:03.018 --> 30:05.499
Another business dinner.

30:05.542 --> 30:08.154
You've had
a lot of those lately.

30:08.197 --> 30:10.243
Sorry, honey.

30:10.286 --> 30:12.288
Duty calls.

30:13.899 --> 30:16.466
Oh, before we get in there,
got any Jade tips for me?

30:16.510 --> 30:17.903
You know, dos and don'ts?

30:17.946 --> 30:19.078
Stuff she likes,
stuff she doesn't.

30:19.121 --> 30:20.688
Oh. You know
that thing you do to me?

30:20.731 --> 30:21.994
With your tongue?The circle thing.

30:22.037 --> 30:22.995
Yeah.Yeah.

30:23.038 --> 30:24.170
Don't do that.

30:24.213 --> 30:25.649
You don't think she'd like that?

30:25.693 --> 30:26.650
No.Why not?

30:26.694 --> 30:28.174
Because I've never liked it.

30:28.217 --> 30:31.003
Copy that. Good tip.

31:18.964 --> 31:20.443
Honey, what are you doing?

31:21.488 --> 31:23.446
What is this?

31:23.490 --> 31:27.189
I want to try something
I read in a book.

31:28.147 --> 31:30.366
I think you'll like it.

31:30.410 --> 31:31.759
Beth Ann...

31:31.802 --> 31:32.891
Shh.

31:32.934 --> 31:35.502
I have to concentrate.

31:48.994 --> 31:51.126
Hold still.Beth Ann.

31:52.127 --> 31:54.303
Oh, my God.

31:54.347 --> 31:55.957
Oh,
my God.

31:56.001 --> 31:58.655
Oh, my God.

32:00.005 --> 32:01.920
Seriously, honey,
that kind of hurts.

32:01.963 --> 32:03.312
I'll go slower.

32:03.356 --> 32:05.271
You really don't have to...

32:05.314 --> 32:07.316
Ow. Ow, ow, ow!

32:15.063 --> 32:16.978
Oh, dear.

32:17.022 --> 32:18.893
Oh!

32:18.937 --> 32:20.895
Oh.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.810
Oh, my God.

32:22.853 --> 32:24.638
I can't believe
that just happened.

32:24.681 --> 32:25.726
Well, it did.

32:27.075 --> 32:29.730
Wow.

32:29.773 --> 32:32.646
I must have done something...

32:32.689 --> 32:34.561
really good in a past life.

32:34.604 --> 32:35.649
Like...

32:35.692 --> 32:38.217
like maybe I was Jesus or...

32:38.260 --> 32:39.827
or that guy that cured polio.

32:39.870 --> 32:41.133
What was his name?

32:41.176 --> 32:43.091
Oh.

32:43.135 --> 32:44.527
Yeah.

32:44.571 --> 32:47.269
Yeah, that's right.

32:47.313 --> 32:50.577
Yeah, it's all
about you guys now.

32:50.620 --> 32:52.840
So what can I do to help?

32:54.102 --> 32:56.539
I'm open to
suggestion.

32:57.540 --> 33:00.021
Hello?

33:00.065 --> 33:01.675
Hey, babe,
can you just give us a minute?Yeah?

33:01.718 --> 33:03.807
Yeah, we're both
very, very close.

33:03.851 --> 33:05.984
Oh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Sure.

33:06.027 --> 33:07.463
I'm hungry.

33:07.507 --> 33:08.899
You guys hungry?

33:08.943 --> 33:09.944
Whew.

33:11.424 --> 33:13.208
I'm gonna get some pie.

33:13.252 --> 33:15.689
Whew. Yeah.

35:05.886 --> 35:07.192
Simone.

35:09.281 --> 35:10.760
Hello, Tommy.

35:10.804 --> 35:12.545
You look nice.

35:12.588 --> 35:13.894
Thank you.

35:17.332 --> 35:19.247
I have the catering van
all afternoon.

35:19.291 --> 35:21.119
Oh, clever idea
switching cars.

35:21.162 --> 35:22.598
Where are we going?

35:22.642 --> 35:24.165
What do you mean,
"Where are we going?"

35:24.209 --> 35:25.514
We're here.

35:31.216 --> 35:32.695
You can't be serious.

35:32.739 --> 35:35.394
You want to make love
to me in a catering van?

35:35.437 --> 35:37.570
The futon is brand-new,
and so are the sheets.

35:37.613 --> 35:40.355
Well, technically,
they're tablecloths.

35:40.399 --> 35:42.444
There's no way I'm getting
into your mobile sex den.

35:44.794 --> 35:45.839
For God's sake.

35:45.882 --> 35:47.057
Then come inside.

35:47.101 --> 35:48.102
Come on.

35:49.364 --> 35:50.539
Oh!

35:54.326 --> 35:57.938
So... what do you think?

35:57.981 --> 35:59.548
You like the candle?

35:59.592 --> 36:01.115
It's sandalwood.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.335
All I can smell
is pastrami.

36:03.378 --> 36:05.815
Oh, yeah. We catered
a bris yesterday.

36:05.859 --> 36:06.903
I can't do this.

36:06.947 --> 36:08.514
Wait.

36:11.778 --> 36:13.432
I even got us music.

36:13.475 --> 36:16.217
I don't care if you hired
the Budapest String Quartet.

36:16.261 --> 36:18.480
I'm not fucking you in a van.

36:18.524 --> 36:20.395
Look, I know you were probably
hoping for a nice hotel,

36:20.439 --> 36:22.441
but I can't afford that.
I'm sorry.

36:22.484 --> 36:26.227
Don't be. I needed to remember
this is a bad idea. Thank you.

36:26.271 --> 36:28.142
Wait-wait.
So y-you're just leaving?

36:28.186 --> 36:29.839
You've always been a good kid.

36:29.883 --> 36:32.190
And you're becoming
a good... friend,

36:32.233 --> 36:34.975
but let's not let a silly
impulse ruin that, okay?

36:42.765 --> 36:44.332
Okay.

36:44.376 --> 36:45.551
Goodbye.

36:45.594 --> 36:47.422
Goodbye.

36:59.347 --> 37:01.654
What will you tell
the doctor?

37:01.697 --> 37:03.090
The truth.

37:03.133 --> 37:04.700
I was cut to shreds

37:04.744 --> 37:07.050
moments after my wife
turned into a French whore.

37:07.094 --> 37:08.965
There's no need to be rude.

37:09.009 --> 37:11.751
Well, I'll be more pleasant once
I've stopped bleeding profusely.

37:11.794 --> 37:13.883
For God's sake.
What were you thinking?

37:13.927 --> 37:15.015
I wanted to surprise you.

37:15.058 --> 37:17.452
Well, next time bake a cake.

37:17.496 --> 37:21.848
I got the idea from...
: a sex manual.

37:21.891 --> 37:23.589
It said men like
that sort of thing.

37:23.632 --> 37:27.636
Well, men on shore leave,
perhaps. Not me.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.334
Well, I had to do something.

37:29.377 --> 37:30.639
Why?

37:32.337 --> 37:34.164
I feel you pulling away from me.

37:35.862 --> 37:37.385
That's not true.

37:37.429 --> 37:39.692
It is.
It absolutely is.
Nah.

37:39.735 --> 37:42.347
It's work. I've
been preoccupied.
No.

37:42.390 --> 37:45.001
It's more than that.

37:45.045 --> 37:47.352
You're unhappy.

37:50.224 --> 37:52.661
I see it.

37:52.705 --> 37:55.403
Every day.

37:55.447 --> 37:58.885
You get up,
you go to work,

37:58.928 --> 38:01.670
you come home,
you eat dinner,

38:01.714 --> 38:04.194
you put on a smile
for my benefit,

38:04.238 --> 38:06.240
and then you go to sleep.

38:06.284 --> 38:09.330
That's what your life is.

38:09.374 --> 38:12.159
And it's empty.

38:14.509 --> 38:16.381
Because of what
we've suffered.

38:16.424 --> 38:19.253
Please don't talk about that.

38:24.258 --> 38:26.434
We've tried
not talking about it,

38:26.478 --> 38:29.089
and it doesn't help.

38:29.132 --> 38:33.963
You're drowning in the routine
of your existence.

38:37.053 --> 38:40.666
I know because I'm drowning
alongside you.

38:44.583 --> 38:49.196
But maybe if
we help each other...

38:49.239 --> 38:52.504
we can survive.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.341
I wish I was a better man.

39:03.384 --> 39:06.256
You are a fine man.

39:06.300 --> 39:08.824
I've made choices...

39:08.868 --> 39:10.478
I'm not proud of.

39:10.522 --> 39:13.481
Like what?

39:17.659 --> 39:19.487
Mr. Stanton?

39:19.531 --> 39:22.534
The doctor
will see you now.

39:22.577 --> 39:24.753
Oh. Okay.

39:27.669 --> 39:29.062
I'll be back soon.

39:29.105 --> 39:30.280
Rob.

39:30.324 --> 39:32.370
I'm glad we had
this little talk.

39:32.413 --> 39:34.502
I feel better.

39:43.076 --> 39:45.426
That was fun, huh?

39:45.470 --> 39:48.821
I mean, I knew sex was cool,
because I'm not a virgin,

39:48.864 --> 39:50.823
but my limited experience

39:50.866 --> 39:52.477
with the girls
on the drill team

39:52.520 --> 39:55.480
did not prepare me for that.

39:57.917 --> 40:00.136
Simone?

40:00.180 --> 40:03.401
Hey, are you okay?

40:03.444 --> 40:04.924
Yes.

40:04.967 --> 40:06.795
Are you sure?
Because y-you seem upset.

40:06.839 --> 40:09.363
No.

40:09.407 --> 40:13.454
I now realize
what I've been missing for...

40:13.498 --> 40:15.543
God, such a very long time.

40:15.587 --> 40:18.981
So you and Mr. Grove never...?

40:19.025 --> 40:20.896
Not for years.

40:20.940 --> 40:23.203
I told myself it's marriage.
Passion fades.

40:23.246 --> 40:25.161
That's what happens
when you get old.

40:25.205 --> 40:26.815
You're not old.

40:26.859 --> 40:28.556
You're a goddess.

40:28.600 --> 40:31.864
Well, the temple's been closed
for quite some time.

40:31.907 --> 40:33.561
But thank you.

40:33.605 --> 40:37.739
For reminding me
that I'm still alive.

40:37.783 --> 40:39.741
You want to do it again?

40:39.785 --> 40:42.483
Yes. What day's good for you?

40:42.527 --> 40:43.615
No, I meant now.

40:43.658 --> 40:45.181
Now?

40:45.225 --> 40:47.096
You can go again already?

40:50.143 --> 40:53.712
Ah, youth.

40:57.237 --> 40:58.847
TAYLOR:
Eli?

41:00.762 --> 41:02.764
In here.

41:05.027 --> 41:07.334
I got to hand it to you, babe.

41:07.377 --> 41:10.293
That was some kind of fun.

41:10.337 --> 41:12.208
Oh, I'm so glad
we went there.

41:12.252 --> 41:14.689
It was absolutely...

41:14.733 --> 41:16.648
Wow.

41:18.040 --> 41:19.433
Yeah.

41:20.565 --> 41:22.654
That's it?

41:22.697 --> 41:25.483
Hey, you don't get a lot of
I-told-you-sos with me, babe.

41:25.526 --> 41:27.876
Don't waste this one.

41:30.313 --> 41:31.663
What's wrong?

41:31.706 --> 41:33.621
Nothing.

41:33.665 --> 41:35.667
Are you sulking?

41:35.710 --> 41:37.407
No.Then what's up?

41:37.451 --> 41:39.061
'Cause you don't look
like a man who just had

41:39.105 --> 41:40.541
his lifelong dream fulfilled.

41:40.585 --> 41:42.369
I need to ask you something.

41:42.412 --> 41:43.457
Okay.

41:44.676 --> 41:46.852
You in love with her?

41:51.987 --> 41:53.293
I knew it.

41:53.336 --> 41:55.251
Six months.

41:55.295 --> 41:58.820
That... should have been
my first clue.

41:58.864 --> 42:01.562
I think you're jumping
to conclusions here.

42:01.606 --> 42:03.129
I saw the way
that you looked at her.

42:03.172 --> 42:04.826
When?

42:04.870 --> 42:06.175
I was there in the doorway.

42:06.219 --> 42:08.351
You two were holding
each other and...

42:08.395 --> 42:12.442
I can't remember the last time
you looked at me like that.

42:18.013 --> 42:20.015
Honey.

42:21.495 --> 42:23.105
This isn't about me.

42:23.149 --> 42:25.107
This is about you.

42:25.151 --> 42:27.153
Don't do that.

42:27.196 --> 42:29.721
You've been insecure lately
because of your career.

42:29.764 --> 42:31.723
Are you in love with her?

42:33.333 --> 42:34.464
No.

42:36.902 --> 42:40.470
Really? Because... that look.

42:42.081 --> 42:43.604
Look, I'll admit,

42:43.648 --> 42:46.041
she's more
than just another hookup.

42:46.085 --> 42:48.696
And I should have told you
about her a long time ago.

42:48.740 --> 42:51.394
But my love story...

42:51.438 --> 42:54.572
is with you.

42:54.615 --> 42:56.965
And it always will be.

42:58.532 --> 42:59.751
Okay?

43:02.057 --> 43:06.758
I guess I have been feeling
a little insecure lately.

43:06.801 --> 43:08.716
Yeah.

43:08.760 --> 43:10.936
And when you guys
didn't come downstairs...

43:10.979 --> 43:12.981
I'm sorry about that.

43:13.025 --> 43:14.243
Truly.

43:15.767 --> 43:18.247
Are we good?

43:22.338 --> 43:23.818
Yeah, we're good.

43:26.342 --> 43:28.257
Hey.

43:28.301 --> 43:30.085
I thought we were having pie.

43:30.129 --> 43:32.697
Yes, we are.
We are.

43:32.740 --> 43:33.959
Great.

43:34.002 --> 43:35.395
Just don't expect
ice cream.

43:35.438 --> 43:36.831
Unless you guys
like it drinkable.

43:47.842 --> 43:50.149
KARL:
Oh, hello.

43:50.192 --> 43:52.368
Where have you been?You committed adultery, Karl.

43:52.412 --> 43:54.196
That means you're
no longer entitled

43:54.240 --> 43:56.024
to keep tabs on my life.

43:56.068 --> 43:57.809
Eh, fair enough.

43:57.852 --> 43:59.419
Did you go to the gym?

43:59.462 --> 44:01.682
Why?
Oh, I don't know.

44:01.726 --> 44:04.250
You seem, uh, energized.

44:04.293 --> 44:06.382
Do I?

44:06.426 --> 44:09.037
Yes. Have you embarked
on a new exercise regimen?

44:09.081 --> 44:12.562
As a matter of fact, I have.

44:12.606 --> 44:17.089
And I plan on working out
as often as I can.

44:30.972 --> 44:33.540
Well, I should get going.

44:34.933 --> 44:36.195
Going?

44:36.238 --> 44:39.111
To my dinner meeting.

44:39.154 --> 44:41.287
You've just gotten back
from the hospital.

44:41.330 --> 44:42.854
I feel fine.

44:42.897 --> 44:46.422
Surely whomever you're
meeting with has already left.

44:46.466 --> 44:48.816
I called the restaurant.

44:48.860 --> 44:51.253
They're still there.

44:55.780 --> 44:57.564
Oh.

44:58.913 --> 45:00.959
Rob, please don't go.

45:01.002 --> 45:02.264
Honey.

45:02.308 --> 45:05.877
This has been
an awkward night.

45:05.920 --> 45:09.881
I really do think you and I
need some time together.

45:13.536 --> 45:15.495
I need to make an appearance.

45:15.538 --> 45:19.281
They must be important clients.

45:19.325 --> 45:21.588
Very important.

45:21.631 --> 45:23.764
Don't wait up.
