01:23.635 --> 01:26.198
Oh, man, I love Oktoberfest.

01:26.199 --> 01:27.742
Oktoberfest!

01:33.399 --> 01:35.709
Sorry, sir, this is a harvest festival.

01:35.710 --> 01:36.556
No alcohol.

01:36.557 --> 01:38.674
I'm gonna have to
confiscate those steins.

01:49.349 --> 01:50.839
Springfield squash

01:50.840 --> 01:53.657
the most fibrous variety
of yellow squash.

01:53.657 --> 01:57.040
We drove 50 miles to look at
a stupid pile of vegetables?

01:57.044 --> 01:58.563
That's it, buster.

01:58.573 --> 01:59.625
You just bought yourself

01:59.625 --> 02:02.280
ten minutes watching that
man make a wagon wheel.

02:02.289 --> 02:03.442
Yes'm.

02:04.305 --> 02:06.022
Wagon wheels were the Internet

02:06.025 --> 02:07.720
of the 19th century!

02:07.725 --> 02:08.642
Really?

02:09.458 --> 02:10.392
No.

02:11.825 --> 02:12.962
Hmm!

02:12.967 --> 02:16.753
This winning cornu copia
is magnificent.

02:17.616 --> 02:19.251
Styrofoam?

02:20.157 --> 02:21.792
You stuffed
your horn?!

02:21.796 --> 02:24.602
What? Everybody does it.

02:25.968 --> 02:27.820
No, no, no, no

02:27.826 --> 02:29.592
noooo!

02:29.597 --> 02:30.222
Noooo!

02:30.225 --> 02:32.633
I can testify at the trial.

02:32.635 --> 02:34.703
Ain't gon' be no trial.

02:36.327 --> 02:39.322
Ooh, look!
Pine cone first ladies.

02:39.326 --> 02:40.923
Where the hell
is Abigail Adams?!

02:40.927 --> 02:42.011
Oh, there she is.

02:42.016 --> 02:43.883
Where the hell is
Mary Todd Lincoln?!

02:43.885 --> 02:45.250
Oh, she's right there.

02:45.257 --> 02:47.322
Where the hell is
Ida Saxton McKinley?!

02:47.327 --> 02:48.310
Oh, I see.

02:48.315 --> 02:49.063
Where the hell is....?

02:49.076 --> 02:49.780
Dad, look.

02:49.788 --> 02:51.151
A corn maze!

02:51.428 --> 02:53.122
The A-Maize-Ing
Maize Maze

02:53.126 --> 02:55.392
"Betcha can't solve our maze."

02:55.396 --> 02:57.743
Puh! I didn't come here
to be insulted.

02:57.746 --> 02:58.862
We're leaving!

03:01.685 --> 03:02.422
Mm!

03:02.428 --> 03:05.143
Sure is a lot of corn
in this parking lot.

03:05.148 --> 03:07.363
Dad, we're in the maze.

03:10.118 --> 03:10.880
D'oh!

03:13.837 --> 03:16.192
Dad, why don't you
throw me in the air,

03:16.198 --> 03:18.512
and I can see which way is out?

03:19.197 --> 03:19.912
Corn.

03:20.595 --> 03:21.610
More corn.

03:22.126 --> 03:23.693
Another kid getting
thrown in the air.

03:24.168 --> 03:25.983
Witch's coven.

03:25.988 --> 03:27.731

Amateur production of
You Can't Take It With You

03:30.186 --> 03:32.130
Oh, I'm getting dizzy.

03:32.206 --> 03:33.642
And corn again.

03:33.646 --> 03:35.640
Maybe we should split up.

03:35.645 --> 03:36.670
Split up?!

03:36.676 --> 03:39.071
Marge, no! We can
fix this marriage!

03:39.098 --> 03:40.610
No, no, I didn't mean...

03:40.626 --> 03:42.101
Fine, you want out? Then go!

03:42.116 --> 03:43.420
I can make it on my own!

03:43.425 --> 03:46.310
Before I met you,
I had friends and dreams!

03:46.317 --> 03:48.032
I was talking about...

03:48.035 --> 03:49.772
Oh, please take me back.

03:49.786 --> 03:52.341
The dating scene is a nightmare.

03:52.347 --> 03:54.011
I'm begging you!

03:54.015 --> 03:58.981
I just meant we should split
up to get out of this corn maze.

03:59.195 --> 04:00.313
Deep down, I...

04:00.316 --> 04:01.700
I guess I knew that.

04:01.707 --> 04:04.442
Now there must be a way out!

04:04.448 --> 04:05.390
Of our marriage?!

04:05.396 --> 04:06.532
I don't want to live!

04:06.536 --> 04:10.251
I don't want to live...!

04:12.806 --> 04:15.621
Hey, this maze is made of corn!

04:19.545 --> 04:21.682
I'm so sick of being lost.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.380
To hell with maze etiquette!

04:23.386 --> 04:25.530
I'm walking straight outta here!

04:29.776 --> 04:31.123
Electrified for your enjoyment.

04:31.937 --> 04:32.912
Damn it!

04:33.545 --> 04:34.751
Signs also electrified.

04:36.397 --> 04:39.352
How come things that
happen to stupid people

04:39.356 --> 04:41.451
keep happening to me?

04:42.807 --> 04:43.571
Finally!

04:43.576 --> 04:45.082
I knew we could solve that maze

04:45.086 --> 04:47.140
using Tremaux's algorithm.

04:47.146 --> 04:47.973
Told you.

04:47.977 --> 04:48.893
No, you didn't.

04:48.906 --> 04:50.773
Your plan was to burn the corn.

04:50.776 --> 04:52.581
That was never my plan.

04:56.535 --> 04:59.911
I'm lost and I'm starving!

04:59.918 --> 05:02.271
Eat some corn!

05:02.275 --> 05:05.092
I don't have any holders!

05:05.096 --> 05:06.321
Now, don't worry, ma'am.

05:06.326 --> 05:09.173
We'll send a member of our elite canine unit in

05:09.175 --> 05:10.800
to find yourhusband's corpse.

05:11.156 --> 05:12.702
Uh, living corpse.

05:12.706 --> 05:16.071
Say hello to Officer Jaws!

05:17.207 --> 05:20.573
Chief, I'm afraid Officer Jaws is guilty of littering...

05:20.577 --> 05:22.291
and here's the litter!

05:23.158 --> 05:24.413
Okay, everyone

05:24.425 --> 05:26.810
Puppy party at my house!

05:28.596 --> 05:29.780
Oh!

05:29.785 --> 05:32.470
Don't worry! Our dog will find my dad!

05:32.478 --> 05:34.102
We need you, boy!

05:34.628 --> 05:36.103
We need you, boy!

05:46.216 --> 05:47.451
Good boy!

05:47.458 --> 05:49.093
Now go find Homer!

05:49.486 --> 05:51.760
He needs something
with your father's scent.

05:51.766 --> 05:54.260
Maybe there's something in Dad's backpack.

05:55.917 --> 05:57.780
A sports bra?

05:58.577 --> 06:02.291
He just needs it for walking upstairs.

06:24.696 --> 06:27.650
This maze is too hard for me.

06:34.405 --> 06:36.602
To my wife Marge.

06:36.607 --> 06:38.441
In case I don't make it,

06:38.446 --> 06:41.452
here are my Oscar picks for next year

06:41.455 --> 06:45.120
Best Sound Effects Editing:the team from...

06:45.145 --> 06:45.973
Huh?

06:46.245 --> 06:47.591
Ahh...

06:51.995 --> 06:53.560
Dad!

06:54.066 --> 06:55.751
Your dog's quite a tracker.

06:55.755 --> 06:59.422
Say, has he ever thought about a career in law enforcement?

07:05.066 --> 07:06.462
Um, I don't think

07:06.467 --> 07:08.351
he's ever thought about anything.

07:08.357 --> 07:10.973
Santa's Little Helper
would be an awesome police dog.

07:10.976 --> 07:12.171
Can he, Dad?
Can he?

07:12.185 --> 07:14.080
No, and never bring it up again!

07:14.617 --> 07:16.161
- Please, can he?
- All right.

07:23.608 --> 07:26.793
Boy, it is going to be so cool when you're a police dog.

07:45.447 --> 07:46.762
Good boy!

07:46.768 --> 07:48.531
Now, transform.

07:54.428 --> 07:55.721
Cool.

07:57.737 --> 07:59.302
All right, listen up.

07:59.308 --> 08:02.402
For the next two weeks,I'm gonna be your worst enemy,

08:02.407 --> 08:04.572
except this Thursday is the Fourth of July,

08:04.578 --> 08:06.393
so we'll take Friday off as well.

08:06.396 --> 08:08.460
Well, I guess Wednesday everybody's going to be thinking

08:08.477 --> 08:10.782
about the long weekend, so...eh, what the hell?

08:10.786 --> 08:12.651
Why don't we just takethe whole week off?

08:13.666 --> 08:14.920
Why did you let me do that?

08:14.927 --> 08:16.892
We are so far behind.

08:21.907 --> 08:23.653
Nice work, canines.

08:23.655 --> 08:25.510
Bring in the next group.

08:46.844 --> 08:49.123
Uh, should I get this blow back to the cage, Chief?

08:49.123 --> 08:51.566
Whoa, whoa, whoa."Blow"? "Cage"?

08:51.605 --> 08:52.990
You're in uniform, Lou.

08:52.999 --> 08:54.373
Don't slang it up.

08:55.426 --> 08:58.962
It is my privilege to welcome this fine group of animals

08:58.968 --> 09:01.090
into the Springfield Police Force.

09:01.095 --> 09:05.171
Keep your noses clean and your hearts free of worms.

09:05.457 --> 09:08.010
Listen to me, rook,these streets are hard.

09:08.017 --> 09:11.213
It ain't like Air Bud V: Strong Arm Of The Paw.

09:11.216 --> 09:12.450
Attention all units:

09:12.456 --> 09:15.942
domestic disturbance in
progress at Rural Route 27.

09:15.946 --> 09:17.261
Domestic disturbance?!

09:17.267 --> 09:19.283
You're gonna have one hell of a first day, boy.

09:19.285 --> 09:20.691
Squeak 'em if you got 'em.

09:24.198 --> 09:26.730
You gave that hog a day of beauty,

09:26.735 --> 09:28.632
and I didn't get nothing!

09:28.638 --> 09:29.911
Manicure...

09:30.006 --> 09:31.280
pedicure...

09:31.286 --> 09:33.011
exfoliation!

09:34.448 --> 09:35.492
Don't worry, boy,

09:35.495 --> 09:36.890
she just knocked a few fleas off you.

09:36.905 --> 09:38.213
You're gonna be okay.

09:38.238 --> 09:40.232
We need backup now!

09:44.198 --> 09:45.851
Cletus, you coward!

09:45.856 --> 09:47.493
Is you man or turtle?

09:47.497 --> 09:48.862
Here's your answer.

09:48.867 --> 09:51.403
Skittle, skittle,scurry, skittle.

09:51.567 --> 09:54.851
Okay, since the dog's not here,
I'm gonna take you for a walk.

10:04.248 --> 10:05.402
What's the matter, Bart ?

10:05.605 --> 10:07.901
Oh, I miss Santa's Little Helper.

10:08.126 --> 10:11.493
I wanted him to be a police dog,
but now he has no time for me.

10:11.615 --> 10:13.053
I even have to eat
my own homework.

10:25.955 --> 10:27.422
Hey, could you
set us up down here?

10:34.778 --> 10:36.923
Easy there, pal.
We just started our shift.

10:39.736 --> 10:40.920
Attention K-9 unit.

10:41.075 --> 10:43.723
We got an 866 in progress
at the park. Over.

10:43.885 --> 10:45.432
Chief, why are you using
the walkie-talkie?

10:45.537 --> 10:46.542
I can hear you fine.

10:47.056 --> 10:49.251
Fine. Let's not use
any of our police equipment.

10:52.226 --> 10:55.161
So, uh, you got any steroids?

10:55.345 --> 10:58.220
Oh, you know it.
I can make you huge.

10:59.517 --> 11:01.282
I want to pump my guns.

11:01.407 --> 11:02.732
I want to rip my pecs.

11:02.887 --> 11:04.530
I want to shriv my nards.

11:04.728 --> 11:06.333
"Nards," that's what
we needed to hear.

11:07.645 --> 11:08.452
Freeze!

11:11.098 --> 11:13.460
Nobody ever freezes.
Might as well just say "run."

11:19.467 --> 11:21.921
Catch me if you can,
little bowwow.

11:32.095 --> 11:33.171
No!

11:41.157 --> 11:43.091
Nice work... partner.

11:57.357 --> 12:00.291
You stand accused of giving
hope to scrawny young men.

12:00.397 --> 12:03.642
- How do you plead?
- Guilty... of being innocent!

12:08.377 --> 12:09.312
Well, I'm afraid,

12:09.418 --> 12:11.642
because of this improperly
filled-out police report,

12:12.367 --> 12:14.053
I have no choice
but to let you go.

12:14.225 --> 12:15.292
Case dismissed.

12:15.478 --> 12:17.173
Ho-ho!
Don't worry, dude,

12:17.327 --> 12:18.273
I'm going straight...

12:18.427 --> 12:21.461
straight to my customers
to sell more drugs.

12:26.388 --> 12:27.763
Listen, man, you got to let it go.

12:28.025 --> 12:29.723
Relax for a couple
days with your family.

12:29.827 --> 12:30.940
Come back fresh on Monday.

12:36.996 --> 12:38.271
Boy, you're back!

12:39.495 --> 12:41.122
Ow ! You bit me!

12:41.767 --> 12:43.423
My own dog bit me!

12:52.068 --> 12:53.063
I can't believe it.

12:53.228 --> 12:54.721
My own dog bit me.

12:54.996 --> 12:57.073
Now that he's had
a taste of human flesh,

12:57.178 --> 12:59.222
the dog will be a slave
to its succulence.

12:59.667 --> 13:02.113
Look at him eyeing me.
He knows I taste best.

13:02.327 --> 13:03.571
Don't blame the dog, folks.

13:03.816 --> 13:06.872
A cop's life is so tense,
he has to channel it somewhere.

13:07.166 --> 13:09.270
Me, I knit violent imagery.

13:10.995 --> 13:12.073
Pretty grim, huh?

13:12.898 --> 13:16.122
Oh, I love Santa's Little
Helper, but I don't know

13:16.225 --> 13:18.071
if we can have him
in our home anymore.

13:18.178 --> 13:21.471
Mom, you can't send him away!
He's a dog, not Grandpa!

13:21.636 --> 13:24.192
What if Santa's Little Helper
stops being a police dog,

13:24.366 --> 13:27.231
then he can get a nonviolent
job like barking songs

13:27.337 --> 13:28.853
on novelty Christmas records.

13:29.046 --> 13:30.273
You can do it, boy!

13:34.328 --> 13:36.090
No, boy, that's Hanukah!

13:36.227 --> 13:38.542
Forget it, kid.
He's a cop now.

13:38.678 --> 13:40.342
Well, I bet he can't resist this.

13:41.625 --> 13:42.420
Fetch, boy!

13:45.247 --> 13:47.153
My God!
I've lost him.

13:49.047 --> 13:50.151
Homer!

13:51.695 --> 13:54.070
Oh, relax, Marge.
I'm just messing with you.

13:54.406 --> 13:56.891
I know I'm not a dog.
I'm a people, like you.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.861
Homer, it's just Flanders.
You know him.

14:08.326 --> 14:10.061
You're going to live
with me now 'cause...

14:10.197 --> 14:12.213
'cause only cops understand cops.

14:12.295 --> 14:14.282
Hey, Lou, want to party tonight?

14:14.387 --> 14:15.812
Oh, not tonight, Sharquelle.

14:16.016 --> 14:17.482
I'm hanging out
with my new roommate.

14:17.567 --> 14:20.370
Oh, my God!
A police dog!

14:20.605 --> 14:23.513
Oh, I have a friend
who would love him.

14:28.887 --> 14:32.211
Okay, but just remember:
They don't love us.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.082
They just love the uniform.

14:34.587 --> 14:36.530
All right, now,
who's going with who?

14:39.135 --> 14:40.440
I don't want a new dog.

14:40.538 --> 14:42.632
I want my old dog.
The one who bit me.

14:42.847 --> 14:43.941
Cheer up, boy.

14:44.067 --> 14:46.140
We'll get you their
most vicious street cur!

14:46.297 --> 14:47.830
He'll bite your ass raw!

14:47.946 --> 14:49.360
No street curs!

14:52.687 --> 14:54.500
That's it!
I want a snake!

14:54.976 --> 14:56.803
Oh, no problem, pally.

14:57.055 --> 14:59.151
Our pythons cost
five dollars a foot.

15:04.778 --> 15:06.123
We're not made of money!

15:06.255 --> 15:07.050
All right.

15:16.206 --> 15:17.532
He is so awesome.

15:17.756 --> 15:19.481
I already love him
more than I love Lisa.

15:19.638 --> 15:22.030
It says here
don't bother naming them.

15:22.227 --> 15:25.000
Snakes have poor hearing,
and only live to strangle.

15:25.208 --> 15:27.730
I like it. "Strangles."

15:27.907 --> 15:29.533
Hey, Lis, you want
to touch Strangles?

15:29.686 --> 15:31.833
He's not slimy at all.
He's scaly.

15:32.886 --> 15:34.883
Eww! He is slimy!

15:34.978 --> 15:36.680
That's because
I soaked him in slime!

15:38.307 --> 15:41.073
Why, you little...
I'll teach you to trick your sister !

15:49.508 --> 15:50.931
Homer, can you breathe?

15:51.136 --> 15:53.873
Well, I can breathe out okay.

15:56.188 --> 15:59.753
Don't... give...
snake... attention.

15:59.927 --> 16:03.981
It's what...
he really... wants !

16:06.476 --> 16:07.281
I'm okay.

16:09.385 --> 16:10.681
After months of practice,

16:10.888 --> 16:14.152
I have trained my rabbit
to hop in perfect tempo

16:14.407 --> 16:17.803
to Mussorgsky's immortal
Pictures at an Exhibition.

16:18.527 --> 16:21.922
Now for some hip-hop
we can all get down with!

16:30.177 --> 16:32.503
Bart Simpson, you can't
bring a python to school!

16:32.687 --> 16:35.122
Hey, don't ask me to show
if you can't handle the tell.

16:36.836 --> 16:39.613
Well, I'm going to show you
to the principal,

16:39.728 --> 16:41.811
and tell him all about it.

16:46.157 --> 16:47.813
Mine was as funny as his.

16:47.927 --> 16:49.523
No one's arguing with you, lady.

16:49.635 --> 16:51.131
Now, can we just learn something?

16:51.445 --> 16:53.392
The snake's getting away!

17:14.635 --> 17:15.770
The snake must be in there.

17:27.566 --> 17:28.811
You miss him, don't you?

17:29.198 --> 17:30.430
Lou, he's got to get over it.

17:30.738 --> 17:33.442
I miss Shamrock Shakes,
but they ain't coming back till March!

17:33.806 --> 17:36.881
You know, Chief,Shamrock Shakes
are just vanilla shakes colored green.

17:37.477 --> 17:39.610
I taste the flavor.
It's a very mild mint.

17:39.778 --> 17:41.493
Well, maybe, because
it's a minty color,

17:41.607 --> 17:42.993
your mind is fooling your tongue.

17:43.116 --> 17:44.111
I know what I taste!

17:44.297 --> 17:46.153
I got to go with
the chief on this one.

17:46.405 --> 17:47.641
Whoa! There's a big surprise.

18:23.987 --> 18:26.031
Hey, Lou, what's your
favorite thing in the world,

18:26.128 --> 18:27.561
so I can dump all over that?

18:33.757 --> 18:34.760
Time for a head count.

18:34.895 --> 18:36.450
Children,
line up according to height.

18:36.618 --> 18:37.400
No, weight.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.933
No, the sum total of the letters
in your last name

18:40.095 --> 18:41.993
if each letter
is assigned a numeric value

18:42.088 --> 18:44.300
according to its place in the alphabet.
Quickly, now!

18:46.235 --> 18:48.913
Deadly toxic cloud!
Deadly toxic cloud!

18:51.296 --> 18:52.113
Bart's missing.

18:52.287 --> 18:53.603
He must still be in the school!

18:56.615 --> 18:58.242
No, boy!
It's too dangerous!

18:58.357 --> 18:59.193
Let him go, Lou.

18:59.368 --> 19:01.280
He's not following
his nose this time.

19:01.497 --> 19:02.883
He's following his heart.

19:03.255 --> 19:06.513
Sometimes I forget why you're chief,
but I remember now!

19:07.518 --> 19:08.812
You follow your heart, boy!

19:12.725 --> 19:15.992
Here, Strangles!
Strangles?

19:19.765 --> 19:22.763
Oh, man, it's like
some chemicals cut one.

19:26.216 --> 19:28.530
Strangles, you came to save me!

19:29.328 --> 19:31.770
Santa's Little Helper,
you came, too!

19:40.316 --> 19:42.802
Sorry, but a boy's got
to go with his dog.

19:43.608 --> 19:46.922
If he hurts you again,
don't call me.

19:48.035 --> 19:50.240
Who am I kidding, I'll always
be there for you.

19:53.457 --> 19:55.522
And... saved!

19:55.978 --> 19:59.321
Hero cop saves boy!
Hero cop saves boy!

20:08.927 --> 20:10.960
Oh, I knew you loved me, boy!

20:11.077 --> 20:13.023
Now you can be my dog again.

20:20.248 --> 20:22.561
Don't worry.
I'll give ya a home.

20:26.085 --> 20:27.163
That'll do, snake.

20:30.076 --> 20:30.891
That'll do.
