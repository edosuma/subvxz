in the Napoleonic wars.

17:10.266 --> 17:11.767
Justin: What's the idea?

17:11.900 --> 17:13.400
Ted: I'm going to repurpose
that whole big cabinet.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.433
- Okay.
- So these drawers

17:15.567 --> 17:18.900
can either go this way,
and you have sides, right?

17:19.033 --> 17:20.467
So we might have to cut them
down.

17:20.600 --> 17:21.967
Justin: That's a good idea.
Ron: Yeah.

17:22.100 --> 17:24.333
- Glad I thought of it.

17:24.467 --> 17:27.467
Ted: I try not to alter
antiques but in this case,

17:27.600 --> 17:29.767
the wood is from the same place,

17:29.900 --> 17:32.734
since the confessional is going
to a haunted house attraction,

17:32.867 --> 17:36.800
I don't think historical
details really to matter here.

17:36.934 --> 17:38.200
Ron: Ready?
- Let's see what it looks like.

17:38.333 --> 17:40.734
Yeah, see? Now it looks good.

Justin: We have two walls,
we have these walls already.

17:43.367 --> 17:45.467

the wall?

18:01.533 --> 18:02.734

up, ready to go.

Brandon: I got you good though.

23:03.333 --> 23:04.800
I mean it's scary enough
already,

These are very cool.
Jake: Gorgeous.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.800
- They, they haven't even had
bindings on them yet.

25:06.934 --> 25:09.200
- Wow. And I guess this is
the original paint on it too?

25:09.333 --> 25:11.166
- Oh yeah, it's all original.

25:11.300 --> 25:12.734
We found these up in North Bay.

25:12.867 --> 25:14.900
There's some old skis up here.

25:18.533 --> 25:20.934
- So, uh, what are you hoping
to get for this?

25:21.066 --> 25:23.266
- $500 bucks.
- $500.

25:23.400 --> 25:25.767
I was kind of thinking
like maybe $100.

25:25.900 --> 25:27.533
- $100 bucks?
- $100 bucks.

25:27.667 --> 25:29.133
- I'll sell you those other
ones for $100 bucks

25:29.266 --> 25:31.100
but not these.
- $150?

25:31.233 --> 25:32.867
- I, I still, I, I can't.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
- I just, I don't think I can
afford that right now.

25:35.133 --> 25:37.200
What do you have there?
Look at that.

25:37.333 --> 25:39.066
- That's a pretty cool pogo
stick, eh?

25:39.200 --> 25:41.100
That's a pretty cool one,
it's heavy duty.

25:41.233 --> 25:42.767
- Goodness, it's nothing like
I've ever seen before.

25:42.900 --> 25:44.867
- Oh yeah, it's hyped up.
Brandon?

25:45.000 --> 25:46.533
- Yeah?
- Show how it works, man.

25:46.667 --> 25:48.400
- What?
- You're good at this.

25:48.533 --> 25:50.433
- I did it one time and Ted
thinks I'm like a professional

25:50.567 --> 25:51.934
at this now.
Oh wait, let's,

25:52.066 --> 25:53.533
let's firm up the deal here
first.

25:53.667 --> 25:57.000
So what's your budget on this?
- Would you do $30 for it?

25:57.133 --> 25:59.100
- I'd probably do $50 for it.

25:59.233 --> 26:00.900
Jake: If you can prove that
this is in working condition

26:01.033 --> 26:04.333
I will pay you $50 for it.
- Alright. Okay, you ready?

- Come on.
- We're ready.

26:06.834 --> 26:08.600

a hundred times. See?

- Oh yeah.
- It's pretty cool, eh?

26:12.867 --> 26:14.600
- Alright. Alright.
- $50 bucks?

26:14.734 --> 26:17.033
- Keep going, keep going.
- That, that earns the $50.

26:17.166 --> 26:18.600

- I'll pay the $50 for it.

26:18.734 --> 26:20.367

I love the way it looks.

43:06.066 --> 43:07.900
Marvin: I was going to say,
it's not the liberty bell but...

43:08.033 --> 43:10.266
- And it tells the whole story.
- Yeah.

43:10.400 --> 43:11.800
- Why is there a weld
in there?

43:11.934 --> 43:14.133
Because we tore down the church
where this bell sat.

43:14.266 --> 43:15.667
Ted: Okay.

43:15.800 --> 43:17.934
- We are planning on putting it
on the property somewhere,

43:18.066 --> 43:20.000
probably in the graveyard
we're thinking.

43:20.133 --> 43:21.200
Justin: Okay.
Let's unstrap it then and...

43:21.333 --> 43:23.467
and get it ready...
- Get it ready.

43:24.600 --> 43:26.467
(Whirring)

43:26.600 --> 43:28.266
(Bell tolls)

43:28.400 --> 43:29.900
- It still works. (Laughs)

43:33.667 --> 43:35.266
- You all the way though?
Got it.

43:35.400 --> 43:37.133
Perfect.
I'm going to hold this.

43:37.266 --> 43:38.867
I don't want it to fall again.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.133
This felt good.
I broke their bell,

43:41.266 --> 43:43.600
I got it fixed and we brought
it all the way back up.

43:43.734 --> 43:46.533
And I feel like my good deed
for the year

43:46.667 --> 43:48.100
is checked off the list.

43:50.200 --> 43:51.900
Perfect. Well, there you go,
there's your bell.

43:52.033 --> 43:54.734
Marvin: Thank you very much,
guys. Have a safe trip home.

43:54.867 --> 43:57.333
Ted: No problem.
- Priestly did a fine job

43:57.467 --> 44:00.700
and I thank them very much
for what, all they did for us.

44:04.767 --> 44:11.734
