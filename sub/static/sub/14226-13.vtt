WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:04.117
Ten years ago, our ship
crash-landed on Earth.

00:04.470 --> 00:06.057
We came here seeking refuge,

00:06.108 --> 00:08.109
but the humans thought
that it was an invasion.

00:10.915 --> 00:13.583
That night, I met a human
girl who tried to protect me...

00:13.887 --> 00:16.158
a girl I never thought I'd see again.

00:16.160 --> 00:18.298
The surviving members
of my race, the Atrians,

00:18.300 --> 00:22.175
were rounded up and isolated
inside a militarized sector.

00:22.177 --> 00:24.015
Now it's 2024.

00:24.017 --> 00:25.986
Seven of us have been
chosen to attend high school

00:25.988 --> 00:28.638
as a part of a government
integration program.

00:28.660 --> 00:30.094
But the humans and Atrians

00:30.096 --> 00:32.098
continue to distrust each other,

00:32.101 --> 00:34.705
while I fight to protect
my people and the human girl

00:34.707 --> 00:36.917
who saved my life... at any cost.

00:39.587 --> 00:41.591
When my mom returned to
the Sector, Vega wanted her

00:41.593 --> 00:44.031
to build something called
the Suvek for the Trags.

00:44.033 --> 00:45.399
You think it's some kind of bomb?

00:47.035 --> 00:49.339
We're gonna smuggle the
Suvek outside of the Sector

00:49.341 --> 00:50.845
using the Mardi Gras Unity float.

01:03.603 --> 01:05.604
I told you I would handle Roman.

01:13.623 --> 01:15.726
Roman. Oh, my God.

01:26.245 --> 01:27.613
Just stay with me.

01:27.675 --> 01:30.012
I... I made it back here.

01:30.014 --> 01:32.447
That's all I wanted to do.

01:32.449 --> 01:34.952
You ran all the way from the Sector?

01:35.955 --> 01:37.757
- I'm... I'm calling a doctor.
- No.

01:37.759 --> 01:41.896
Cas... Castor stabbed me with a blade...

01:41.898 --> 01:44.065
coated in Atrian poison.

01:45.534 --> 01:47.503
Doctors can't help me.

01:49.676 --> 01:53.015
- What about cyper? I could go to the Sector...
- No.

01:53.017 --> 01:55.184
- It's too dangerous.
- If cyper's the only thing

01:55.186 --> 01:57.922
that's gonna save your life,
then I'm willing to take the risk.

01:57.924 --> 01:59.625
I just need you

01:59.627 --> 02:02.296
to fight to hold on until I can get back.

02:20.133 --> 02:22.301
Mmm, thanks.

02:22.303 --> 02:24.904
Mmm. I don't remember what
it feels like to be full.

02:24.906 --> 02:28.110
- This is normal.
- None of this is normal.

02:28.112 --> 02:30.281
I haven't even told my parents.

02:30.283 --> 02:32.517
What's going to happen
when I start showing?

02:35.224 --> 02:36.693
And not to mention...

02:36.695 --> 02:38.494
I suddenly have Wonder Woman strength.

02:38.496 --> 02:41.262
All the women in my tribe
get stronger during pregnancy.

02:41.264 --> 02:44.564
Oh, here. Eat this herb.

02:44.566 --> 02:47.599
It's called dyret. It'll
help with the symptoms.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.571
What are we doing?

02:51.573 --> 02:53.307
What do you mean?

02:53.309 --> 02:56.006
I mean, how is this supposed to work?

02:56.008 --> 02:57.175
Where would the baby live?

02:57.177 --> 02:59.779
I can set something up in my pod.

02:59.781 --> 03:01.749
No baby of mine is living in a jail.

03:01.751 --> 03:04.918
That jail is also my home.

03:04.920 --> 03:06.586
Trust me...

03:06.588 --> 03:08.588
we're gonna work something out. All right?

03:14.360 --> 03:16.161
- Mm...
- You all right?

03:16.163 --> 03:17.729
Mm.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.797
- Nice, you got the baby.
- What?

03:20.935 --> 03:22.070
You found... you found the plastic baby

03:22.072 --> 03:23.305
hidden inside the king cake.

03:24.774 --> 03:25.774
That's good luck.

03:25.776 --> 03:28.478
Oh.

03:28.480 --> 03:30.081
It's good luck.

03:33.354 --> 03:35.054
It's Gloria.

03:35.958 --> 03:37.157
Have you heard from Grayson?

03:37.159 --> 03:39.159
Do we know if he got the Suvek to Gloria?

03:39.161 --> 03:40.794
No, I haven't heard anything.

03:40.796 --> 03:42.198
But it's only been an hour.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.202
And no news is good news. Right?

03:45.337 --> 03:48.303
Why does my mask look like Freddy Krueger?

03:48.305 --> 03:51.141
Well, clearly you have a
thing for complicated dudes.

03:51.143 --> 03:53.410
You excited for your
first-ever Mardi Gras, Jules?

03:54.613 --> 03:57.215
With my first-ever boyfriend.

03:57.217 --> 03:59.985
How long is this first-ever
stuff gonna last, exactly?

03:59.987 --> 04:02.154
Just until I've done everything.

04:02.156 --> 04:03.690
And there are a lot of things

04:03.692 --> 04:05.226
I'm looking forward to doing very soon.

04:05.228 --> 04:06.795
Well, hopefully

04:06.797 --> 04:08.897
not while we're sitting here at the table.

04:15.637 --> 04:16.904
Taylor heard back from Gloria.

04:16.906 --> 04:18.305
The float never made it to school.

04:18.307 --> 04:21.505
Wha... are you serious? Where could it be?

04:22.540 --> 04:24.407
- You talk to Grayson?
- No.

04:24.409 --> 04:25.944
What's the big deal?

04:25.946 --> 04:27.121
Grayson probably just made a pit stop.

04:27.147 --> 04:28.631
No, he would've went straight to school.

04:28.645 --> 04:31.648
- He should've been there by now.
- What's going on?

04:31.650 --> 04:33.085
You guys are acting really weird.

04:35.822 --> 04:37.422
There's something you guys should know.

04:37.424 --> 04:38.690
There's a reason that we

04:38.692 --> 04:41.023
took the float into the Sector today.

04:42.460 --> 04:44.195
- How much does Taylor know?
- As much as Gloria.

04:44.197 --> 04:45.597
That Grayson was supposed to drive

04:45.599 --> 04:47.933
the float back to school,
but never showed up.

04:47.935 --> 04:49.367
They don't know about the bomb.

04:49.369 --> 04:50.668
And now's probably not the best time

04:50.670 --> 04:52.069
to send Taylor into a panic spiral.

04:53.673 --> 04:55.874
- What are we gonna do?
- Drake, you were part of the crew

04:55.876 --> 04:58.275
that worked on the float today
at the Sector. Where could it be?

04:58.277 --> 05:00.261
- I have no idea.
- Seriously?

05:00.369 --> 05:03.017
You lose a float and I'm
supposed to trust you with a baby?

05:03.019 --> 05:06.454
Gloria is gonna explode if
this float doesn't show up.

05:10.122 --> 05:12.357
How do you guys even
know this thing is a bomb?

05:12.359 --> 05:15.026
Because Suvek literally means
blast or flash in Sondiv.

05:15.028 --> 05:16.250
That sound like a peach cobbler to you?

05:16.253 --> 05:17.584
Guys, I just called Grayson's cell phone.

05:17.585 --> 05:19.216
An emergency room nurse answered.

05:19.249 --> 05:21.196
Grayson got carjacked.

05:23.368 --> 05:24.402
Well, is he okay?

05:24.404 --> 05:25.836
He's beat up pretty bad.

05:25.838 --> 05:29.004
Vega must have sent
her Trags after Grayson.

05:29.006 --> 05:31.540
If they attacked him
and they stole the float,

05:31.542 --> 05:33.474
the Suvek could still
be out there somewhere.

05:38.144 --> 05:39.812
Won't be long, now.

05:39.814 --> 05:42.684
The Suvek is in the hands
of our outside operative.

05:42.686 --> 05:44.419
And by sunset tomorrow night,

05:44.421 --> 05:47.288
the playing field will drastically change.

05:47.290 --> 05:49.087
All thanks to you.

05:49.089 --> 05:52.323
Killing Castor, bringing
us the Iksen's Key.

05:54.126 --> 05:55.826
But you look troubled.

05:58.226 --> 06:00.829
Roman is dead.

06:02.099 --> 06:04.532
Castor killed him with a poison kos.

06:07.233 --> 06:10.004
I know how you felt about Roman.

06:10.006 --> 06:11.937
But he opposed our cause.

06:11.939 --> 06:14.869
And we do not mourn our enemies.

06:17.505 --> 06:19.171
I just need to take a walk.

06:19.173 --> 06:20.872
Clear my head.

06:26.911 --> 06:29.077
Sure this is where you left
your camera this morning?

06:29.079 --> 06:31.379
Yep, on a table in the House of Cards.

06:31.381 --> 06:34.114
It's a vintage analog. They
don't make them anymore.

06:35.116 --> 06:37.050
I'll just be a few minutes.

06:38.951 --> 06:40.418
Be careful.

06:53.994 --> 06:55.294
Emery?

06:55.296 --> 06:57.029
- What are you doing here?
- Teri, please.

06:57.031 --> 06:59.196
I need to get cyper to save Roman.

06:59.198 --> 07:00.730
Roman's alive?

07:00.732 --> 07:02.763
He ran to my house to get away from Castor.

07:02.765 --> 07:03.865
He's bleeding out.

07:03.967 --> 07:05.832
If I don't get cyper, he's gonna die.

07:06.999 --> 07:08.600
Cyper alone won't cure him.

07:08.602 --> 07:10.670
You'll need Atrian blood. My blood.

07:10.672 --> 07:12.371
I'm coming with you.

07:19.200 --> 07:23.372
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

07:28.816 --> 07:30.352
You're gonna be fine, Grayson.

07:30.354 --> 07:32.554
Your friends are here to see you.

07:34.524 --> 07:36.662
Hey.

07:36.664 --> 07:38.566
Glad you're all right.

07:38.568 --> 07:40.903
Lukas told us about the Suvek.

07:40.905 --> 07:42.403
What happened to the float?

07:42.405 --> 07:45.274
I was driving it to Gloria...

07:47.914 --> 07:50.015
and I must have been ambushed.

07:50.017 --> 07:53.184
Whoever hit me must have
taken the float and the Suvek.

07:53.186 --> 07:55.119
- You didn't get a look at 'em?
- No.

07:55.521 --> 07:58.523
- It all happened so fast.
- All right.

07:58.525 --> 08:01.428
We got to call Gloria, let her
know that there's a bomb inside

08:01.430 --> 08:02.995
- the missing float.
- Gloria will just call the cops.

08:02.997 --> 08:04.829
We can't waste any more time.

08:04.831 --> 08:06.630
We have to call them ourselves.

08:16.439 --> 08:19.043
Is he still breathing?

08:22.515 --> 08:24.715
Barely.

08:43.467 --> 08:44.900
Give it time.

08:44.902 --> 08:47.168
We've done everything we can.

09:22.680 --> 09:25.014
Let's rock and roll.

09:26.752 --> 09:28.086
I've already confirmed

09:28.088 --> 09:29.420
the photo booth and the deejay...

09:29.422 --> 09:31.055
Now, this assumes we actually have a float

09:31.057 --> 09:32.290
for the parade, doesn't it?

09:32.292 --> 09:33.891
Yes, we are doing everything we can

09:33.893 --> 09:35.226
to locate the float, Ms. Garcia.

09:35.228 --> 09:36.964
Is that some kind of a senior prank?

09:36.966 --> 09:38.565
Floats don't just go missing.

09:38.567 --> 09:40.299
You were supposed to be
supervising that committee.

09:40.301 --> 09:43.670
I'm sorry. I've just been
a bit overextended lately.

09:46.208 --> 09:48.273
Oh. Uh, one of the krewe

09:48.275 --> 09:50.742
just reported that the float
made it to the warehouse.

09:50.744 --> 09:52.544
What are you doing with dyret?

09:53.746 --> 09:55.245
Now I understand why you've been

09:55.247 --> 09:56.978
so overextended lately.

09:56.980 --> 09:59.248
There's only one reason to have dyret.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.585
Who's the father?

10:00.587 --> 10:02.483
You know what? Don't tell me.

10:02.485 --> 10:03.885
I don't need to know.

10:03.887 --> 10:06.455
Do you understand how serious this is?

10:06.457 --> 10:08.590
If word got out, people
would think that Atrians

10:08.592 --> 10:10.125
were preying on our young girls...

10:10.127 --> 10:12.127
I know, okay?

10:16.032 --> 10:17.733
I'm...

10:17.735 --> 10:21.140
not even sure that I'm gonna keep the baby.

10:22.511 --> 10:24.478
I mean, how can I?

10:24.480 --> 10:27.181
What would that life even look like?

10:28.818 --> 10:31.319
You're coming with me.

10:39.193 --> 10:41.027
I think he's waking up.

10:45.731 --> 10:46.832
I can't believe it.

10:46.834 --> 10:48.067
Go get him some water.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.177
Teri.

10:58.179 --> 11:00.179
What are you doing here?

11:00.181 --> 11:02.747
Saving your life, stupid.

11:04.117 --> 11:06.153
Where's Emery?

11:06.155 --> 11:07.657
She'll be right back.

11:07.659 --> 11:09.759
She came into the Sector to get cyper.

11:09.761 --> 11:11.694
And I used my blood.

11:16.572 --> 11:18.106
Thank you.

11:21.815 --> 11:24.588
I never thought I'd see you again.

11:24.590 --> 11:27.594
I don't think I've ever
seen you cry before.

11:28.798 --> 11:30.130
Yeah, well...

11:30.132 --> 11:32.399
you've never almost died before.

11:36.738 --> 11:39.608
This is who you really are, Teri.

11:39.610 --> 11:41.344
A healer.

11:47.484 --> 11:49.481
Roman!

11:55.755 --> 11:57.323
Emery.

11:57.325 --> 11:59.362
Roman needs to be back

11:59.364 --> 12:02.395
at the Sector by sundown...
he isn't safe here.

12:02.397 --> 12:05.697
Castor's not gonna be a
problem for him anymore.

12:05.699 --> 12:08.001
Thanks, Teri.

12:15.281 --> 12:18.583
This is my third message.
Where are you, Emery?

12:18.585 --> 12:20.484
Listen, the cops found the float.

12:21.486 --> 12:22.945
Call me back, please.

12:23.287 --> 12:25.455
Hey, there's nothing in
that thing except confetti

12:25.457 --> 12:26.617
and cigarette butts.

12:26.860 --> 12:28.526
We used this float to
smuggle an Atrian bomb

12:28.528 --> 12:29.927
out of the Sector last night.

12:29.929 --> 12:31.930
Is there any chance that whoever stole it

12:31.932 --> 12:32.999
left behind any clues?

12:33.001 --> 12:36.550
I know you... you're that Montrose kid.

12:36.735 --> 12:38.069
Hey, do us a favor...

12:38.071 --> 12:38.980
quit wasting our time.

12:39.074 --> 12:41.574
Okay, fine. If you're not gonna help
us, then we'll call Gloria Garcia.

12:41.576 --> 12:43.411
Gloria told us to handle this.

12:44.748 --> 12:47.416
Let's go, guys.

12:47.418 --> 12:48.652
Are you serious?

12:48.714 --> 12:50.248
They're not even gonna help us?

12:50.250 --> 12:51.751
Just because of the Red Hawks?

12:51.753 --> 12:53.613
There's a bomb at Mardi Gras.

12:53.615 --> 12:55.788
That Trag who float-jacked you
last night must have driven it here

12:55.790 --> 12:58.196
and taken the Suvek out.
They couldn't have gone far.

12:58.291 --> 12:59.458
I know, makes sense.

12:59.460 --> 13:01.194
They'd want to set it
off in a crowded place,

13:01.196 --> 13:02.794
and with the whole town
here for Mardi Gras...

13:02.796 --> 13:05.088
But how are we supposed to find it?
They could have taken it anywhere.

13:06.698 --> 13:09.935
I'm picking up trace amounts
of radiation from the float.

13:09.937 --> 13:11.538
It's probably left over from the Suvek.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.373
So we search the area and
try to pick up the signal.

13:13.375 --> 13:15.073
And if you measure anything over 500 CPM,

13:15.075 --> 13:17.274
then you're definitely
getting closer to it.

13:17.276 --> 13:18.810
Let's split up.

13:22.883 --> 13:24.784
The Trags targeted you.

13:24.786 --> 13:26.987
Castor tried to kill me.

13:28.856 --> 13:32.458
Fighting for my people nearly
cost us both of our lives.

13:33.594 --> 13:36.095
But here we are.

13:36.097 --> 13:38.767
Here we are.

13:48.744 --> 13:51.912
My father wanted me to be the next leader,

13:51.914 --> 13:55.150
to see his dream of integration through.

13:57.421 --> 14:02.058
He said we needed to put the needs
of our people above everything else.

14:03.961 --> 14:06.428
That's my father's path, not mine.

14:06.430 --> 14:09.568
How can you be so sure?

14:11.737 --> 14:14.438
Because my path always
leads me right back here...

14:14.440 --> 14:16.875
to you.

15:53.827 --> 15:56.296
- Anything?
- Not yet.

15:56.298 --> 15:58.933
Hopefully, the others
are having better luck.

16:13.282 --> 16:14.333
Don't worry.

16:14.407 --> 16:17.349
They think even Gloria
Garcia has abandoned them.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.785
They're all alone now.

16:24.820 --> 16:27.222
So is this how you always imagined it?

16:27.224 --> 16:29.591
On the floor of your parents' shed?

16:31.531 --> 16:36.501
Nothing about us has been what
I imagined it would be like.

16:36.503 --> 16:40.107
But right now, everything
is as it should be.

16:49.387 --> 16:51.290
Mm.

16:51.292 --> 16:54.862
That's the third time in two minutes.

16:54.864 --> 16:58.797
Mm. Let me just see who's calling.

17:01.516 --> 17:03.051
- It's Grayson.
- Of course it is.

17:03.053 --> 17:04.787
The eternal iwap blocker.

17:04.789 --> 17:06.521
He called eight times.

17:06.523 --> 17:07.989
Emery, the Suvek was stolen last night.

17:07.991 --> 17:09.086
We're trying to find it.

17:09.088 --> 17:11.152
Listen, stay away from the parade. Okay

17:12.622 --> 17:14.155
My sister's at Mardi Gras.

17:14.156 --> 17:16.290
So are my parents and all of our friends.

17:16.292 --> 17:19.358
Teri said something to you before she left.

17:19.359 --> 17:21.691
She warned you to get back
to the Sector before sundown.

17:21.693 --> 17:24.125
Maybe that's when the Trags are
planning to detonate the Suvek.

17:24.127 --> 17:25.700
She probably wanted me back
in the Sector so I'd be safe.

17:25.701 --> 17:26.637
That leaves us only

17:26.728 --> 17:28.894
a little over an hour before
they plan to set it off.

17:28.896 --> 17:30.896
Hey.

17:30.898 --> 17:34.435
We're not gonna let that happen, all right?

17:34.437 --> 17:38.442
Remember to set the Suvek to
detonate at exactly 5:50 p.m.

17:38.444 --> 17:40.577
That is the opportune time.

17:40.579 --> 17:41.977
Sundown. Got it.

17:41.979 --> 17:44.413
Oh, wait. One more thing.

17:44.415 --> 17:45.481
The human zwabs that tried

17:45.483 --> 17:47.152
to steal the Suvek are here.

17:47.154 --> 17:49.355
And the Atrian traitors who helped them.

17:49.357 --> 17:51.559
Drake and Sophia.

17:51.561 --> 17:53.728
Yep. They're looking for the Suvek now.

17:53.730 --> 17:55.428
Order your men to stop them,

17:55.430 --> 17:57.996
even if it means having
to slaughter our own.

18:03.843 --> 18:05.177
Where are we?

18:05.179 --> 18:07.881
The future home of Edendale Springs.

18:07.883 --> 18:11.188
52 acres of state-of-the-art homes,

18:11.190 --> 18:12.623
top-notch security, three community parks,

18:12.625 --> 18:14.126
and that's just the first phase.

18:14.128 --> 18:16.662
Impressive. But I don't get it.

18:16.664 --> 18:18.297
Are you moonlighting as a Realtor?

18:18.299 --> 18:19.966
It's going to be a community

18:19.968 --> 18:22.501
designed exclusively for
Atrians and mixed-race couples.

18:22.547 --> 18:24.413
A place where they can live freely,

18:24.415 --> 18:27.982
without fear of judgment or
attack, far from the Sector.

18:29.083 --> 18:31.619
Why haven't I heard about it?

18:31.621 --> 18:34.290
Well, the Atrian Relations
Committee is keeping it under wraps.

18:34.292 --> 18:36.760
Just until the project
is ready to be unveiled.

18:37.996 --> 18:40.094
I know this isn't easy,

18:40.096 --> 18:42.096
what you're going through, and you'll make

18:42.098 --> 18:44.096
your own decision. But before you do,

18:44.098 --> 18:48.205
you deserve to know what
your life could look like

18:48.207 --> 18:51.643
if you decide to have this baby.

18:53.714 --> 18:56.120
Grayson, where are you?

18:57.122 --> 18:59.221
I... I can't hear you.

18:59.223 --> 19:00.624
No, I...

19:00.626 --> 19:02.960
Okay, hold on, hold on.

19:03.828 --> 19:05.863
Okay, we're here.

19:06.732 --> 19:08.767
Well, where are you?

19:21.778 --> 19:23.814
Wait. Roman?

19:25.649 --> 19:28.315
Yeah, yeah, I... yeah, I'm on my way.

19:47.832 --> 19:49.833
Dad?

19:57.898 --> 19:59.205
Dad?

20:11.716 --> 20:13.950
Dad?

20:16.887 --> 20:19.624
Roman, thank you for coming.

20:19.626 --> 20:22.863
I don't know who you are,
but I came because I...

20:24.265 --> 20:26.302
saw my father.

20:26.304 --> 20:27.669
Sorry to disappoint you.

20:27.671 --> 20:29.136
I am Jesytur.

20:29.138 --> 20:31.103
I guard the gateway to Eljida.

20:31.105 --> 20:33.038
As for seeing your father...

20:34.040 --> 20:35.942
this herb draws Atrians to it

20:35.944 --> 20:39.248
by evoking their most powerful
memories, which for you

20:39.250 --> 20:41.617
are of your father. I had to draw you

20:41.619 --> 20:44.554
from the crowd without
exposing my identity.

20:44.556 --> 20:47.593
An Atrian from the Sector
came to Eljida last night.

20:47.595 --> 20:50.295
The mother of your friend, Drake.

20:52.396 --> 20:54.294
Saroya?

20:54.296 --> 20:57.862
She says that the Trags are
planning to set off the Suvek.

20:57.864 --> 20:59.529
They must be stopped,

20:59.531 --> 21:01.197
or thousands of humans and Atrians

21:01.199 --> 21:02.798
will lose their lives.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.633
We tried to destroy the Suvek but failed.

21:04.655 --> 21:07.087
Even if we found it, I don't
know if we could stop it now.

21:07.089 --> 21:09.420
The Suvek can only be
activated by the Iksen's Key.

21:09.422 --> 21:12.020
The Iksen's Key. My father used
to wear that around his neck.

21:12.022 --> 21:13.725
If you remove the key from the Suvek,

21:13.727 --> 21:16.094
you may be able to stop
it from being deployed.

21:16.096 --> 21:17.596
Nox had much faith in you.

21:17.608 --> 21:19.508
He knew he could depend on you

21:19.510 --> 21:21.377
to safeguard the future of our people.

21:21.379 --> 21:24.413
My father expected a lot from me, but I...

21:24.415 --> 21:26.950
I can't be held responsible
for his legacy anymore.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.220
Why is that?

21:28.222 --> 21:30.188
Because I made a promise

21:30.190 --> 21:32.857
to a person that means a lot to me.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.696
There's someone you should meet.

21:42.504 --> 21:44.605
Roman...

21:45.841 --> 21:47.775
this is your half-brother.

21:55.614 --> 21:57.749
You have to call the hit off on my friends.

21:57.751 --> 21:59.450
There has to be another way.

21:59.452 --> 22:03.687
We will kill anyone who stands
in the way of our victory.

22:16.238 --> 22:18.304
Grayson, I'm at 4th and Main.

22:18.306 --> 22:20.307
I don't see you anywhere. Call me back.

22:38.982 --> 22:40.380
What do you want?

22:40.382 --> 22:42.781
Your father killed our leader.

22:42.783 --> 22:44.483
You have defiled Atrian purity

22:44.485 --> 22:46.019
by seducing his heir, Roman.

22:46.021 --> 22:47.989
We want to watch...

22:47.991 --> 22:49.224
you...

22:49.226 --> 22:50.459
bleed.

22:50.461 --> 22:51.661
Hey! You don't want her.

22:51.663 --> 22:53.432
You want me.

22:53.434 --> 22:56.171
I'm Grayson Montrose, son of
the leaders of the Red Hawks.

22:56.173 --> 22:58.907
Yeah. The humans that want to wipe

22:58.909 --> 23:01.180
the Atrians off the face of the planet.

23:01.182 --> 23:03.616
You let her go, and you can have me.

23:15.700 --> 23:17.538
Look, let's hang by the cops.

23:33.855 --> 23:36.323
I heard what those guys said. Are they...

23:36.325 --> 23:38.324
Are they Trags? How did
they get outside the Sector?

23:38.326 --> 23:40.360
They're Hidden Trags, Atrians
who've had their markings

23:40.362 --> 23:43.396
removed so they can live among humans.

23:43.398 --> 23:46.531
There are terrorist
Atrian cells in Edendale?

23:46.533 --> 23:48.364
And they're after you?

23:48.366 --> 23:50.331
They're trying to stop
us from finding the Suvek.

23:50.333 --> 23:52.065
And apparently they hate me out here

23:52.067 --> 23:54.068
as much as they do in there.

23:54.070 --> 23:56.672
Because of Roman.

24:00.107 --> 24:03.141
So where's he now?

24:03.143 --> 24:06.477
When we were together...

24:06.479 --> 24:09.014
you always came first.

24:11.487 --> 24:14.023
You still do.

24:17.092 --> 24:18.333
We lost 'em. Come on.

24:19.134 --> 24:20.478
I hoped you both would meet one day

24:20.480 --> 24:22.328
when the integration became complete.

24:22.330 --> 24:24.762
Now the future is uncertain. I...

24:24.764 --> 24:26.733
thought it best you meet each other now.

24:26.735 --> 24:28.404
I knew about my father and Gloria.

24:28.406 --> 24:30.404
I just had no idea they had a son.

24:30.406 --> 24:31.838
Your father left many things undone

24:31.840 --> 24:33.572
when he was taken from us.

24:33.574 --> 24:36.274
He was grooming you to carry on his work.

24:43.213 --> 24:45.045
I have to go find the Suvek.

24:45.047 --> 24:47.782
You both should return to Eljida.

24:50.721 --> 24:52.959
I'm gonna see you again, okay?

24:57.766 --> 24:59.166
Good luck.

24:59.168 --> 25:01.636
We're all depending on you.

25:12.453 --> 25:15.621
Thank you for showing me Edendale Springs.

25:15.623 --> 25:17.988
It's the first time since...

25:17.990 --> 25:21.359
I found out I was pregnant that...

25:21.361 --> 25:23.432
I feel like there's hope.

25:23.434 --> 25:27.234
Well, I'm really glad to hear you say that.

25:28.804 --> 25:31.007
Bye.

25:43.755 --> 25:46.057
This is Gloria.

25:48.094 --> 25:50.028
I... I'm on my way.

25:54.468 --> 25:56.434
I got a signal.

25:56.436 --> 25:59.241
I just got a signal.

26:01.913 --> 26:04.217
Hey. Hey. You guys find anything?

26:04.219 --> 26:06.222
I'm getting an elevated
radiation reading on this block.

26:06.224 --> 26:09.160
The Suvek must be nearby. I'll
tell the others to meet us here.

26:09.929 --> 26:11.294
Is that Taylor?

26:12.531 --> 26:15.164
I know you didn't want me to come,

26:15.166 --> 26:17.433
but guess who I bumped into at the parade.

26:19.872 --> 26:21.542
- Surprise.
- Zoe.

26:21.544 --> 26:24.280
She just got back into
town. Can you believe it?

26:24.282 --> 26:26.916
I told her about our
little soufflé in my oven.

26:26.918 --> 26:28.316
Don't be mad.

26:29.552 --> 26:30.886
Hey, girl, didn't you just say

26:30.888 --> 26:32.655
that you were really hungry?

26:32.657 --> 26:34.451
That place has the best beignets in town.

26:34.453 --> 26:36.252
Ooh...

26:36.254 --> 26:38.420
I'll be right back.

26:40.257 --> 26:42.226
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't

26:42.228 --> 26:43.628
snap your neck right here.

26:43.630 --> 26:46.263
I can think of four.

26:51.233 --> 26:53.632
What do you want?

26:53.634 --> 26:56.933
I want you to stop your
friends from finding the Suvek.

26:56.935 --> 26:58.401
And if you don't, I'll make you

26:58.403 --> 27:00.333
watch Taylor and your unborn freak baby

27:00.335 --> 27:02.634
meet a very painful end.

27:04.638 --> 27:07.206
If I were you, I'd get moving.

27:17.211 --> 27:19.881
Hey. We found Roman.

27:20.582 --> 27:22.314
Is everything okay?

27:22.316 --> 27:23.381
You just disappeared.

27:23.383 --> 27:24.715
Some Hidden Trags came after us,

27:24.717 --> 27:27.351
- and I was worried...
- Did they hurt you?

27:27.353 --> 27:28.986
I got away. Thanks to Grayson.

27:28.988 --> 27:30.421
Where were you?

27:31.622 --> 27:34.587
I met an Atrian who told me
something about my father.

27:34.589 --> 27:36.991
I'll tell you more about it later, but...

27:36.993 --> 27:40.229
it could change the
promise that I made to you.

27:40.231 --> 27:42.900
Radiation readings are
highest in this building.

27:42.902 --> 27:44.736
We checked all the floors. Nothing.

27:44.738 --> 27:46.071
What about the roof?

27:56.652 --> 27:59.221
Elevator's fine.

27:59.223 --> 28:00.824
The Suvek could be on the
roof. I'm gonna check it out.

28:00.896 --> 28:02.261
Wait!

28:02.263 --> 28:04.164
We got to pull out now.

28:04.166 --> 28:06.703
- What's wrong?
- Zoe's alive. She has Taylor.

28:06.705 --> 28:08.171
If we go after the Suvek, she'll kill her.

28:12.177 --> 28:14.311
Where's Taylor now?

28:14.313 --> 28:15.074
You and your friends were right.

28:15.102 --> 28:19.450
This is a great place to
watch the parade. Whoo-hoo!

28:20.051 --> 28:21.142
_

28:25.143 --> 28:28.530
_

28:29.622 --> 28:31.653
What is that thing?

28:31.655 --> 28:33.823
Oh, just a little device

28:33.825 --> 28:36.359
that's gonna bring an end to mankind.

28:37.727 --> 28:39.859
No. No, seriously.

28:39.861 --> 28:40.860
What is it?

28:40.862 --> 28:42.262
You heard me.

28:42.264 --> 28:44.031
It's gonna usher in the age of the Atrians,

28:44.033 --> 28:46.032
and all the humans are
gonna be wiped off the face

28:46.034 --> 28:47.733
of your own planet. Or...

28:47.735 --> 28:49.368
gathered up and sent to the Sector,

28:49.370 --> 28:52.469
since I know how much you and
your humans love your camps.

28:52.471 --> 28:54.302
Zoe,

28:54.304 --> 28:55.735
what's going on?

28:58.936 --> 29:00.234
That's not...

29:00.236 --> 29:02.668
- You can't be...
- You want to know what

29:02.670 --> 29:04.570
the hardest thing about
pretending to be human was?

29:04.572 --> 29:06.772
Having to act like we were friends.

29:06.774 --> 29:08.081
I don't understand.

29:08.082 --> 29:11.945
You're the embodiment of everything
that's wrong with the human race.

29:12.015 --> 29:15.089
Oh, and don't even get me started
on your relationship with Drake.

29:15.186 --> 29:17.353
Because your little baby is an abomination

29:17.355 --> 29:19.557
that I'm personally gonna have to fix.

29:28.369 --> 29:29.902
Find her.

29:29.904 --> 29:32.506
The rest of you stand
guard. It's almost time.

29:59.976 --> 30:02.245
If Zoe is a hidden Trag,
and she has the Suvek,

30:02.247 --> 30:03.848
we should be up there trying to stop her.

30:03.850 --> 30:05.984
If Zoe sees us, she will kill Taylor.

30:05.986 --> 30:08.054
Look, if we don't do anything,
we'll all end up dead.

30:08.056 --> 30:09.689
Drake, they're right.

30:11.359 --> 30:12.994
You and Emery said

30:12.996 --> 30:15.164
the Trags are setting the
Suvek off at sunset, right?

30:15.166 --> 30:16.600
We have more time.

30:16.602 --> 30:18.336
Sunset's in ten minutes.

30:26.152 --> 30:27.554
You're okay.

30:27.556 --> 30:29.682
Zoe... she's on the roof,

30:29.693 --> 30:30.819
and she's actually an Atrian,

30:30.820 --> 30:32.605
and she has four other
fake human Atrians with her

30:32.606 --> 30:35.191
and this machine that
looks like a vacuum cleaner,

30:35.193 --> 30:38.529
but could bring an end to
humanity, or... or something.

30:38.531 --> 30:41.199
Sophia and Lukas, just

30:41.201 --> 30:42.967
get people away from the building.

30:42.969 --> 30:45.105
Julia and Eric, find whatever
you can to barricade the door.

30:45.107 --> 30:46.743
There might be hidden Trags outside.

30:46.745 --> 30:48.644
Drake, Grayson and I
are gonna go to the roof.

30:48.646 --> 30:50.647
Taylor, you need to get in your car

30:50.649 --> 30:52.785
and get as far away from here as you can.

30:52.787 --> 30:54.021
Yeah, I'm going with you and Grayson

30:54.023 --> 30:55.553
to the roof, but we need a plan.

30:55.555 --> 30:58.022
Zoe's not just gonna hand over the Suvek.

31:14.264 --> 31:16.264
I think I have a plan.

31:16.266 --> 31:18.265
It's almost time.

31:18.267 --> 31:21.034
We must prepare for battle.

31:35.802 --> 31:36.603
Vega!

31:37.015 --> 31:39.317
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

31:43.191 --> 31:46.749
_

31:46.750 --> 31:47.750
_

31:50.670 --> 31:53.570
_

31:53.571 --> 31:57.570
_

32:18.395 --> 32:21.385
I know about the Suvek, and I'm
already evacuating Mardi Gras.

32:21.387 --> 32:23.249
Now, where is it?

32:24.843 --> 32:26.544
It doesn't matter.

32:26.546 --> 32:28.479
You're too late.

32:45.284 --> 32:46.308
_

32:47.309 --> 32:49.378
_

32:56.045 --> 32:56.828
Go! Move it!

32:58.399 --> 33:00.601
Last chance, Vega. Tell
me where the Suvek is,

33:00.603 --> 33:02.670
or you will end your days in the Crate.

33:02.672 --> 33:04.103
We'll be out soon.

33:04.105 --> 33:05.904
And you're the first person I'll come for.

33:05.906 --> 33:07.941
You and the rat who betrayed me.

33:07.943 --> 33:09.344
It was me.

33:11.615 --> 33:16.219
- You did this?
- I couldn't let you kill my friends.

33:16.955 --> 33:19.223
This will not please your father.

33:19.225 --> 33:21.359
My father?

33:21.361 --> 33:24.728
You said he never left Atria.

33:24.730 --> 33:27.030
You're going to wish that were true.

33:27.032 --> 33:29.730
You all will.

33:37.076 --> 33:39.138
We got to get everybody out of here fast.

33:39.140 --> 33:40.506
Wait a second.

33:40.508 --> 33:42.376
Wait a second.

33:50.259 --> 33:53.026
Fire! Everyone clear out!

33:53.028 --> 33:55.028
Fire! Run! Go! Run! Fire!

33:55.030 --> 33:56.527
I sent you to get Taylor.

33:56.529 --> 33:58.394
I don't have any use
for her. Get rid of her.

34:03.834 --> 34:06.101
Shoot her. Shoot her!

34:08.505 --> 34:09.538
Go! Go!

34:12.145 --> 34:13.245
Grayson, catch!

34:18.815 --> 34:20.849
I need to find the
Iksen's Key in the Suvek.

34:20.851 --> 34:23.018
- I'll keep her guys busy. Cover me.
- Ok.

34:24.520 --> 34:25.539
Go, go!

34:30.591 --> 34:32.058
We don't have much time.

34:32.895 --> 34:34.931
That should keep a Trag or
three from breaking in, right?

34:34.934 --> 34:36.699
Does it matter? They have a bomb

34:36.701 --> 34:39.235
that could wipe out the
town and everyone in it.

34:39.237 --> 34:41.438
No amount of furniture
is going to stop that.

34:41.440 --> 34:43.572
You're gonna be okay.

34:43.574 --> 34:45.406
You don't know this,

34:45.408 --> 34:48.643
but I've come pretty close to death before.

34:48.646 --> 34:51.311
And I learned you have to
believe you're gonna make it,

34:51.313 --> 34:53.880
or it's like you've already lost.

35:05.629 --> 35:08.967
If we're gonna die tonight,
I wanted to get that in.

35:29.896 --> 35:31.897
I found it!

35:36.268 --> 35:37.868
No, wait.

35:37.870 --> 35:39.737
I got this.

35:48.777 --> 35:51.143
Drop your gun!

36:13.415 --> 36:14.415
Grayson.

36:39.759 --> 36:42.192
You stopped the clock.

36:42.194 --> 36:43.759
Yay, you.

36:43.761 --> 36:45.594
But you should know...

36:45.596 --> 36:48.164
Trags always have a backup.

37:17.258 --> 37:21.097
Emery, get down!

37:51.373 --> 37:54.511
Help! Help!

37:54.513 --> 37:57.985
Someone! Drake, help!

38:17.550 --> 38:19.884
Emery?

38:19.886 --> 38:21.956
Emery?!

38:21.958 --> 38:23.525
Emery.

38:23.527 --> 38:25.293
Emery, please wake up.

38:25.295 --> 38:27.697
Grayson. Come on.

38:30.408 --> 38:31.753
Grayson, wake up.

38:31.754 --> 38:32.254
Come on.

38:37.840 --> 38:39.742
It's not a bomb.

38:39.744 --> 38:42.812
It's a signal.

38:49.917 --> 38:52.118
A signal to who?

39:06.280 --> 39:11.850
