[audience cheers]

01:41.142 --> 01:43.478
Everybody have a seat,
be comfortable, relax.

01:43.561 --> 01:48.399
I got to tell you... let's go.

01:53.154 --> 01:55.406
[audience cheers]

02:01.746 --> 02:02.872
Thank you.

02:08.002 --> 02:09.921
I need you guys to know something.

02:10.004 --> 02:12.507
And I'm gonna tell you the truth,
and don't get freaked out.

02:12.590 --> 02:14.676
This is going to be my last special
for a minute.

02:15.301 --> 02:16.886
[audience screams]

02:17.428 --> 02:20.932
It is all good. Listen to me.

02:21.015 --> 02:23.852
I did it in Detroit for that reason.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.521
[audience cheers]

02:27.605 --> 02:28.940
That's right.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.277
You wanna know why?

02:33.194 --> 02:35.697
'Cause I talked so much shit about
Detroit in the first special

02:35.780 --> 02:39.117
I figured, I might as well,
do the last special here.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.246
Sorry about that, by the way.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.206
[audience laughs]

02:46.124 --> 02:49.586
First of all, before I even start,
I'm gonna say that "I'm rich and famous."

02:49.669 --> 02:51.045
[audience laughs]

02:51.713 --> 02:54.424
And the only reason I say that

02:54.507 --> 02:58.136
is 'cause the last 17 months were hell,
and I cannot imagine

02:58.219 --> 02:59.345
what everybody went through.

02:59.429 --> 03:00.597
Well, I'm happy to see you

03:00.680 --> 03:04.267
and I'm happy you're well
and I hope everyone you love is okay.

03:04.350 --> 03:06.561
[audience cheers]

03:11.149 --> 03:12.901
I don't want you to worry about me,
I'm...

03:13.735 --> 03:15.403
vaccinated, I...

03:15.486 --> 03:16.362
[audience laughs]

03:17.155 --> 03:19.532
got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

03:19.616 --> 03:21.284
[audience laughs]

03:24.120 --> 03:25.538
I got to admit,
that's probably the most

03:25.622 --> 03:27.957
niggaish decision
I've made in a long time.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.125
[applause]

03:31.794 --> 03:34.631
I walk in to the doc like,
"Give me the third best option."

03:34.714 --> 03:35.715
[audience laughs]

03:36.341 --> 03:38.259
I'll have what the homeless
people are having.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.515
So far, so good.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.812
And I know you probably heard on the news,
I did get coronavirus.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.064
And it was something else.

03:51.147 --> 03:54.067
Like, okay first of all, when the doctor
told me I had coronavirus

03:54.150 --> 03:57.028
I got to tell you,
I was surprised how it made me feel.

03:58.655 --> 04:02.909
I felt dirty.

04:02.992 --> 04:04.327
[laughter]

04:04.953 --> 04:06.245
I felt gross.

04:06.996 --> 04:08.790
'Cause I've been walking around Texas

04:08.873 --> 04:12.168
just touching door knobs and shit,
hands all moist.

04:13.711 --> 04:17.173
Tipping niggas with cash.
"Here, take this to your family."

04:17.257 --> 04:18.591
[laughter]

04:20.760 --> 04:22.720
I must have killed
thousands of people.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.848
Just trying
to get tonight's show together

04:25.932 --> 04:26.766
so I hope you appreciate it

04:26.849 --> 04:29.185
'cause a lot of niggas died
for me to get this one off.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.896
[applause]

04:31.980 --> 04:32.981
[cheering]

04:36.109 --> 04:37.986
I hadn't felt that dirty
in a long time.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.823
Last time I can remember,
feeling dirty like that,

04:41.906 --> 04:43.616
man, I must have been a little boy.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.452
I was being molested by a preacher.

04:46.536 --> 04:47.745
[laughter]

04:48.663 --> 04:50.707
But don't feel bad for me,
I liked it.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.208
[laughter]

04:53.584 --> 04:56.170
I used to get a kick out of cumming
in that fellows face.

04:56.254 --> 04:57.797
[audience laughs]

05:00.925 --> 05:02.510
Well, he asked me to do it.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.688
They make you quarantine.

05:14.188 --> 05:15.940
I had to quarantine for ten days at
least.

05:16.024 --> 05:18.234
They said "You're gonna have to stay
in the room," I didn't go nowhere.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.446
And it started making me nuts,
'cause I would just sit in the room

05:21.529 --> 05:23.406
and watch videos all day.

05:23.489 --> 05:25.074
Now, do you know what I was watching?

05:25.158 --> 05:27.785
And I hate to say this,
but there was a lot of videos

05:27.869 --> 05:30.788
sadly, of Black people...

05:32.040 --> 05:34.292
beating up Asians for no reason.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.462
These attacks were unprovoked,
I couldn't believe it.

05:37.545 --> 05:38.421
And I was sitting in the room

05:38.504 --> 05:39.964
watching this shit,
it would stress me out.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.924
I was stressed already
because the whole time

05:42.008 --> 05:44.427
when you get coronavirus,
at least the first five days

05:44.510 --> 05:47.221
you wait, and see
how sick you're gonna get.

05:48.639 --> 05:50.391
And it turns out, and this is true...

05:51.642 --> 05:52.935
I didn't get sick at all.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.437
[laughter]

05:55.271 --> 05:58.107
Not a cough, not a booger,
not a fever, nothing.

05:58.941 --> 05:59.942
Look at me

06:00.610 --> 06:04.113
I am the Magic Johnson of coronavirus.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.948
[audience cheers]

06:09.994 --> 06:12.538
I just sat in the crib
and got stronger all week.

06:14.832 --> 06:18.169
But I was stressed, 'cause I kept watching
these videos of my beloved Black people

06:18.252 --> 06:21.089
beating up my beloved Asian people,
and being so cruel.

06:21.714 --> 06:23.925
And the whole time I watched those videos,
this is fucked up

06:24.008 --> 06:25.593
but I couldn't help but feel like--

06:25.676 --> 06:28.346
When I saw these brothers
beating these Asians up.

06:29.388 --> 06:31.682
It's probably what's happening
inside of my body.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.142
[laughter]

06:35.103 --> 06:36.687
[audience cheers]

06:37.688 --> 06:39.774
[applause]

06:42.276 --> 06:43.694
I didn't get sick.

06:49.700 --> 06:52.912
I also saw a lot of videos of UFOs.

06:52.995 --> 06:55.665
I mean, what the fuck has been going on
with that shit?

06:55.748 --> 06:56.874
This niggas are here.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.584
These UFOs keep coming to Earth

06:58.668 --> 07:00.753
and it made me think of an idea
for a movie.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.755
Sounds dumb, but hear me out.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.590
In my movie idea

07:04.674 --> 07:06.968
we find out that these aliens

07:07.051 --> 07:09.095
are originally from Earth.

07:09.887 --> 07:13.015
That they are from an ancient civilization
that achieved interstellar travel

07:13.099 --> 07:16.477
and left the Earth
thousands of years ago.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.312
Some other planet that they go to

07:18.396 --> 07:20.982
and things go <i>terrible</i>
for them in the other planet

07:21.065 --> 07:22.525
so they come back to Earth

07:22.608 --> 07:26.404
and decide that they want to claim
the Earth for their very own.

07:26.487 --> 07:28.406
It is a pretty good plotline, huh?

07:28.489 --> 07:29.490
<i>[audience] Yeah!</i>

07:29.574 --> 07:32.160
I call it <i>Space Jews.</i>

07:32.243 --> 07:33.578
[laughter]

07:39.125 --> 07:41.002
<i>Space Jews.</i>

07:41.085 --> 07:43.838
-[man] We loved it!
-Alright.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.757
It's going to get worse than that,
hang in there.

07:46.841 --> 07:47.842
[laughter]

07:49.760 --> 07:51.304
It is going to get way worse than
that.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.476
Then I thought of an idea
for a children's book.

07:58.060 --> 08:00.479
I actually wrote it.
It is coming out soon.

08:00.563 --> 08:04.275
The book is designed to help parents,
teach their children about racism

08:04.358 --> 08:06.611
which, if you're a parent you know

08:06.694 --> 08:09.822
is an impossible concept
to teach to a child.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.241
But I'm doing it.

08:12.325 --> 08:17.288
The book is about
a big, strong beautiful Black man

08:17.371 --> 08:20.374
with a benign,
regular-ass White name...

08:21.292 --> 08:24.086
and he has a White speaking voice.

08:25.213 --> 08:28.591
So whenever this motherfucker calls
to get a reservation at a restaurant,

08:29.091 --> 08:30.801
oh, he gets the reservation.

08:30.885 --> 08:31.886
[laughter]

08:33.262 --> 08:35.473
That name and that voice,
who could resist him?

08:36.849 --> 08:41.771
Now I should tell you, this Black man
is literally an actual giant.

08:41.854 --> 08:43.731
And he is a strong dude.

08:43.814 --> 08:47.818
And when he shows up to them restaurants
they see that big giant Black dude

08:47.902 --> 08:51.531
they say "You can't come in here."
And they call the police.

08:54.283 --> 08:56.702
And then every installment of the
book

08:56.786 --> 08:59.872
the police come,
and they always shoot him.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.332
[audience laughs]

09:04.794 --> 09:07.421
But remember, no,
remember this guy is a giant,

09:07.505 --> 09:10.258
these bullets don't kill him,
they don't even hurt him.

09:10.758 --> 09:12.677
They just break his heart.

09:15.304 --> 09:18.474
It is called <i>Clifford,</i>
<i>the Big Black Nigga</i>, anyone?

09:18.558 --> 09:20.268
[audience cheers]

09:34.031 --> 09:36.742
This is my last special,
because I have an objective tonight.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.205
I came here tonight...

09:43.207 --> 09:46.002
because this body of work,
that I've done on Netflix

09:46.877 --> 09:48.504
I'm going to complete.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.006
All the questions you might have had

09:50.089 --> 09:52.800
about all these jokes
I'd said in the last few years

09:52.883 --> 09:54.260
I hope to answer tonight.

09:55.136 --> 10:00.725
And I would like to start by addressing
the LBGTQ community, correct.

10:00.808 --> 10:02.393
[audience cheers]

10:06.397 --> 10:07.940
And I want every member
of the community to know

10:08.024 --> 10:10.026
that I've come here tonight in peace.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.027
[laughter]

10:11.736 --> 10:15.281
And I hope to negotiate
the release of DaBaby.

10:15.364 --> 10:17.825
[laughter]

10:17.908 --> 10:20.202
[audience cheers]

10:24.498 --> 10:27.418
Sad story!

10:30.171 --> 10:32.048
DaBaby
was the number one streaming artist

10:32.131 --> 10:33.632
until about a couple of weeks ago.

10:35.176 --> 10:39.513
Took a nasty spill onstage,
and said some...

10:40.348 --> 10:43.893
said some wild stuff
about the LBGTQ community

10:43.976 --> 10:46.187
during a concert in Florida.

10:47.271 --> 10:48.731
Now you know, I go hard in the paint

10:48.814 --> 10:51.525
but even I saw that shit was like,
"God damn, DaBaby."

10:55.613 --> 10:57.406
He pushed the button, didn't he?

10:58.115 --> 11:00.076
He pushed the button.

11:00.910 --> 11:04.372
Punched the LBGTQ community,
right in the AIDS.

11:04.455 --> 11:05.790
[laughter]

11:07.666 --> 11:08.876
Can't do that.

11:11.128 --> 11:12.463
Can't do that.

11:15.758 --> 11:18.552
But I do believe
and I'll make this point later

11:18.636 --> 11:22.139
that the kid
made a very egregious mistake.

11:22.223 --> 11:23.432
I will acknowledge that.

11:23.516 --> 11:28.729
But, you know a lot of the LBGTQ community
doesn't know DaBaby's history,

11:28.813 --> 11:30.064
he's a wild guy.

11:31.315 --> 11:37.113
He once shot a nigga...
and killed him, in Walmart.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.740
Oh, this is true, Google it.

11:39.824 --> 11:43.411
DaBaby shot and killed a nigga in
Walmart in North Carolina.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.831
Nothing bad happened to his career.

11:46.914 --> 11:48.666
[laughter]

11:49.750 --> 11:51.335
[applause]

11:52.002 --> 11:53.754
Do you see where I am going with
this?

11:56.674 --> 11:59.802
In our country,
you can shoot and kill a nigga

12:00.719 --> 12:03.264
but you better not hurt
a gay person's feelings.

12:03.347 --> 12:04.640
[laughter]

12:07.893 --> 12:12.940
And this is precisely the disparity
I wish to discuss.

12:16.277 --> 12:19.655
I have a question for the audience

12:19.738 --> 12:22.575
and this is a real question,
I am not joking around.

12:23.451 --> 12:29.123
Is it possible, that a gay person
can be racist?

12:30.416 --> 12:33.461
[audience] Yes! Yeah!

12:34.336 --> 12:37.256
-Do you really think so?
-[audience] Yeah!

12:37.339 --> 12:40.509
Of course it is possible.
Look at Mike Pence.

12:41.051 --> 12:43.304
[audience laughs]

12:43.387 --> 12:45.181
[applause]

12:49.101 --> 12:51.479
I am guessing,
but I bet you, he is gay.

12:51.979 --> 12:53.063
-Yeah.
-[woman] Oh my God.

12:53.147 --> 12:57.776
And he is not pride parade gay either,
he is sad gay.

12:59.278 --> 13:00.696
I feel bad for him.

13:01.697 --> 13:04.533
He looks like one of them gays
that prays about it.

13:09.371 --> 13:12.249
Jesus, please take these dirty feelings
out of my heart.

13:12.333 --> 13:13.542
[laughter]

13:14.460 --> 13:17.421
Please Jesus,
make these buttholes ugly to me.

13:18.589 --> 13:20.799
I don't want
to keep on tasting these dicks.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.551
[laughter]

13:26.972 --> 13:27.932
Funny.

13:29.058 --> 13:33.521
You guys are confusing your emotions.
You think I hate gay people

13:33.604 --> 13:35.940
and what you're really seeing

13:36.023 --> 13:38.776
is that I'm jealous of gay people.

13:40.194 --> 13:41.612
I'm jealous,

13:41.695 --> 13:44.323
I'm not the only Black person,
that feels this way.

13:44.406 --> 13:46.242
We Blacks,
we look at the gay community and we go

13:46.325 --> 13:49.828
"God damn it!
Look how well that movement is going."

13:49.912 --> 13:50.996
[audience cheers]

13:52.164 --> 13:55.084
"Look how well you are doing."

13:55.167 --> 13:56.585
[applause]

13:56.669 --> 14:00.297
And we've been trapped in this predicament
for hundreds of years.

14:00.381 --> 14:03.425
How the fuck
are you making that kind of progress?

14:06.053 --> 14:07.846
I can't help but feel like

14:08.389 --> 14:11.392
if slaves had baby oil
and booty shorts...

14:11.475 --> 14:12.851
[laughter]

14:14.019 --> 14:16.105
...we might have been free
a hundred years sooner.

14:16.188 --> 14:17.147
You know what I mean?

14:20.568 --> 14:21.735
If Martin Luther King was like,

14:21.819 --> 14:24.196
"I want everybody
to get up on them floats.

14:25.573 --> 14:28.075
Get your bodies good and shiny."

14:39.044 --> 14:42.047
I don't hate gay people at all,
I respect the shit out of you.

14:42.131 --> 14:43.382
Well, not all of you.

14:45.175 --> 14:47.469
I am not that fond of these newer
gays.

14:48.596 --> 14:51.348
Too sensitive, too brittle.

14:52.308 --> 14:56.312
Those aren't the gays that I grew up with,
I missed them old school gays, nigga.

14:56.395 --> 15:00.441
Them Stonewall niggas,
them the ones that I respect.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.151
[audience cheers]

15:02.651 --> 15:05.821
They didn't take shit from anybody,
they fought for their freedom.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.741
I respect that shit, I'm not even gay

15:08.824 --> 15:11.285
and I want to be like a Stonewall
nigga.

15:12.911 --> 15:14.580
Them old school, gangster gays.

15:14.663 --> 15:17.124
Them glory hole niggas,
them the ones I like.

15:17.207 --> 15:18.542
[woman cheers]

15:21.962 --> 15:24.840
These new gays don't even know
what the glory hole is.

15:27.092 --> 15:30.220
It's a hole in the wall,
that gay contractors build.

15:30.304 --> 15:32.097
[audience laughs]

15:33.933 --> 15:35.601
You want to know why
they put that hole in the wall?

15:35.684 --> 15:37.394
I'll tell you,
there is no nice way to say it.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.606
'Cause when they want
to have some fun

15:40.689 --> 15:44.568
they will put their penises in that
hole

15:45.986 --> 15:47.446
and hope for the best.

15:48.989 --> 15:50.616
I respect that shit.

15:52.618 --> 15:55.537
It's a lot of courage
on both sides of that hole nigga.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.247
[laughter]

15:59.249 --> 16:00.959
I'm not even gay

16:01.669 --> 16:04.088
and I want to try that glory hole
out.

16:04.171 --> 16:05.881
[audience laughs]

16:06.632 --> 16:08.926
[applause]

16:12.471 --> 16:15.265
What if Martin Luther King
had to integrate the glory hole?

16:16.183 --> 16:19.561
"I don't care if it is Black lips
back there or White lips back there

16:20.521 --> 16:22.064
a mouth is a mouth.

16:23.190 --> 16:25.150
A warm wet mouth."

16:28.696 --> 16:30.030
I'm going all the way.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.034
I got into a fight.

16:34.118 --> 16:36.036
I almost got into a fight,
it is complicated.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.414
I was in a bar in Austin, with my
wife

16:38.497 --> 16:44.712
and it was during Covid,
and a woman came to our table

16:44.795 --> 16:48.382
and she was maskless,
and this bitch came over, no mask,

16:48.465 --> 16:51.927
all "H" words. "Hi, how are you?"

16:52.011 --> 16:52.970
[laughter]

16:53.846 --> 16:56.098
Droplets was coming out
of this bitch's face.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.600
We all covered our drinks.
Ew! Baby, what are you doing?

17:09.486 --> 17:12.656
Now I looked over the table that she came
from, and I peeped game.

17:12.740 --> 17:15.200
The men at the table were filming me.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.036
This happens when you're famous.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.371
People will come over
and try to rattle your cage

17:19.455 --> 17:21.415
and get you
to say something stupid or dumb

17:21.498 --> 17:23.083
so that their buddies can film it

17:23.167 --> 17:25.586
and get a video
of you embarrassing yourself.

17:25.669 --> 17:27.504
And clearly I said,
"This is what is happening."

17:27.588 --> 17:31.091
And these dumb motherfuckers thought,
it was my first rodeo.

17:31.175 --> 17:33.385
[laughter]

17:34.970 --> 17:37.264
[applause]

17:42.603 --> 17:44.313
Sadly it worked.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.106
[audience laughs]

17:46.732 --> 17:49.318
I ran right over there, I said--
I pointed right in the camera

17:49.401 --> 17:52.154
I said, "You is a bitch-ass nigga
for doing this to me."

17:52.237 --> 17:54.031
[audience laughs]

17:58.660 --> 18:01.288
And the dude was shocked
that I said it. He said "Huh?"

18:01.371 --> 18:03.832
And when he did like this,
I've seen all his fingernails

18:03.916 --> 18:05.918
is painted and I realized like,
"Oh-oh."

18:06.001 --> 18:07.544
[laughter]

18:11.632 --> 18:12.883
"This fellow is gay."

18:14.635 --> 18:17.554
Yeah, you know how I talk.
I call everybody a bitch-ass nigga.

18:17.638 --> 18:18.722
You know what I mean?

18:19.473 --> 18:22.351
But that is not a right thing to do
if they're gay. You know what I mean?

18:22.434 --> 18:24.061
And now I was in trouble

18:24.144 --> 18:26.563
and not only that,
the motherfucker was huge.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.649
He stood up, he was towering over me.

18:28.732 --> 18:32.152
He must have been 6' 5",
a big White corn-fed

18:32.236 --> 18:34.905
Texas homosexual,
this nigga was ready to fight.

18:36.907 --> 18:40.494
And he started barking on me,
but I stood my ground, I wasn't scared.

18:41.537 --> 18:42.704
How could I be scared?

18:42.788 --> 18:45.541
This motherfucker's shirt was tied up
in a knot like this.

18:45.624 --> 18:48.127
Oh, fuck this guy.
Let's go, nigga, let's go.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.382
I thought we were going
to come to blows.

18:53.465 --> 18:56.510
I was ready and then

18:56.593 --> 18:59.388
right when you think we would fight,
guess what he did?

18:59.471 --> 19:03.350
He picked up his phone
and he called the police.

19:04.643 --> 19:07.479
And this, this thing I am describing

19:07.563 --> 19:10.691
is a major issue
that I have with that community.

19:10.774 --> 19:15.404
Gay people are minorities,
until they need to be White again.

19:15.487 --> 19:16.905
[laughter]

19:17.698 --> 19:19.491
[applause]

19:21.743 --> 19:25.372
I'm being very brutally honest,
so we can solve this problem.

19:25.455 --> 19:26.582
I'm telling you right now

19:26.665 --> 19:28.959
a Black gay person
would have never done that to me.

19:29.042 --> 19:31.545
'Cause a Black gay person knows,
when the police shows up

19:31.628 --> 19:33.755
they're not going to care
who called 'em.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.592
They don't show up like,
"Which one of you niggers is Clifford?"

19:36.675 --> 19:38.010
[laughter]

19:39.094 --> 19:40.512
We're all Clifford.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.436
This happens far too often.

19:48.228 --> 19:51.773
Another time, about six years ago,
there was a lesbian woman

19:51.857 --> 19:54.818
that tried to sell a story
about me to TMZ.

19:54.902 --> 19:58.906
Thank goodness, TMZ could see
right through the sham of that story.

19:59.907 --> 20:02.409
This woman claimed
that I beat her up in a night club

20:02.492 --> 20:06.496
because she was a lesbian.
That is fuckin' crazy.

20:06.997 --> 20:08.790
Bitch, I didn't even know
you was a woman.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.834
[audience laughs]

20:14.838 --> 20:17.132
Thank God! TMZ didn't believe that

20:18.592 --> 20:20.928
because I did beat the shit out of her,
I am not gonna lie.

20:21.011 --> 20:22.721
[audience laughs]

20:24.973 --> 20:26.808
It was her fault, I had no choice.

20:27.684 --> 20:29.561
I came into the club
minding my own business

20:29.645 --> 20:30.687
and a woman came up to me,
and she goes

20:30.771 --> 20:32.481
"Oh my God, Dave Chappelle."

20:32.564 --> 20:34.066
And I was just being reciprocally nice.

20:34.149 --> 20:36.026
"Hey, miss, how are you?"
Blah, blah, blah.

20:36.109 --> 20:39.655
Benign talk, nothing to it.
And all of a sudden

20:40.155 --> 20:42.741
this lesbian fellow stepped
between us.

20:43.992 --> 20:45.452
"Hey nigga, that's my girl!"

20:45.535 --> 20:48.455
I said, "Yo, my man, back up."
Like that.

20:50.123 --> 20:53.502
She said, "I ain't backing up off shit,
nigga, that's my girl!"

20:53.585 --> 20:57.422
I said, "Bro, you gonna have to give me
three feet, like this."

20:58.966 --> 21:01.885
She said, "Stop calling me a man,
motherfucker."

21:02.386 --> 21:05.305
-I am a woman."
-I said, "What?"

21:05.389 --> 21:07.099
[laughter]

21:10.978 --> 21:13.814
And then I looked deep
in this nigga's cheek bones.

21:15.190 --> 21:17.442
And I said, "Oh my God, you are a
woman."

21:18.568 --> 21:20.821
This is too much for me
to even wrap my mind around

21:20.904 --> 21:23.615
but I tell you what,
I un-balled my fist immediately

21:23.699 --> 21:26.243
and I softened my posture

21:26.326 --> 21:28.453
so that she would know,
she is in no danger.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.497
I even changed the tone of my voice.

21:33.375 --> 21:38.171
I said softly, sweetly,
like a pimp might say.

21:38.255 --> 21:39.589
[laughter]

21:41.758 --> 21:43.802
"Bitch, I'm 'bout to slap
the shit out of you."

21:43.885 --> 21:46.555
[cheers and applause]

21:52.769 --> 21:54.187
I should have done it.

21:55.105 --> 21:56.440
Oh, I wish I didn't say that.

21:56.523 --> 22:00.652
She dropped that foot back,
she was in a perfect southpaw stance.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.487
Her shoulders were angled correctly,

22:02.571 --> 22:05.198
her head movement was good,
I said "Oh, no!

22:05.949 --> 22:07.868
this bitch boxes for real."

22:10.037 --> 22:11.413
She threw a wild hook at me

22:11.496 --> 22:14.249
and I saw it coming from yesterday,
so I slipped it like this...

22:16.168 --> 22:19.379
I had no choice, I had to go to
work.

22:20.547 --> 22:23.592
I let that jab go,
you should have seen me go nigga.

22:24.593 --> 22:27.888
I tenderized them titties
like chicken cutlets.

22:27.971 --> 22:29.598
[laughter]

22:33.143 --> 22:36.146
I whooped the toxic masculinity
out of that bitch.

22:45.947 --> 22:46.865
[man cheers]

22:46.948 --> 22:48.533
That is why I don't go out no more.

22:50.911 --> 22:53.914
Just trying to chill,
I'm just trying to live a peaceful life.

22:53.997 --> 22:57.167
That's why I live in Ohio,
you know, I live in a little town in Ohio.

22:57.250 --> 23:00.670
Must be like 3700 people,
small hippie town.

23:00.754 --> 23:04.382
Culturally you might feel like,
like Ann Arbor to you.

23:04.466 --> 23:05.759
[laughter]

23:06.593 --> 23:10.305
You know what I mean?
Bunch of hippies and shit like that.

23:11.556 --> 23:12.724
And niggas always ask me like,

23:12.808 --> 23:14.351
"Dave, why do you live
in that hippie town?"

23:14.434 --> 23:16.269
And I'd be embarrassed
to tell 'em the truth.

23:16.353 --> 23:17.813
Well, you know why I live there?

23:17.896 --> 23:22.442
Because Yellow Springs, Ohio
has the most beautiful women in the world.

23:23.276 --> 23:24.778
And a lot of people
might disagree with me

23:24.861 --> 23:28.115
but, you got to see them
for yourself, they're gorgeous.

23:28.198 --> 23:30.534
But it all depends on what you're into.
You know what I mean?

23:31.034 --> 23:33.495
I like White bitches with dirty feet.

23:33.578 --> 23:35.580
[audience laughs]

23:40.752 --> 23:44.506
If I had a strip club in Yellow Springs,
I would have called that shit "Strippies."

23:44.589 --> 23:46.925
All naked hippies, all the time.

23:47.008 --> 23:49.302
And I would only hire girls
with long titties

23:49.386 --> 23:53.306
and long vagina head
that looks like they slept on it.

23:57.394 --> 24:00.105
And I would keep a pile of dirt,
right next to the stage.

24:00.730 --> 24:03.817
I'd come up like, "Bitch get your feet in
that dirt and get up there

24:03.900 --> 24:05.986
and give those
people what they came to see."

24:06.945 --> 24:08.238
"Chalk up, bitch."

24:20.750 --> 24:24.588
Couple of years ago I was in Ohio,
at a shopping mall.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.175
An old White lady-- This is true,

24:28.258 --> 24:30.468
she was following me
around the mall.

24:30.552 --> 24:34.472
Which sounds paranoid,
but I'm sure she was following me.

24:34.556 --> 24:35.724
Mean lady too.

24:35.807 --> 24:37.934
You ever see a woman
with lines on her face?

24:38.018 --> 24:38.977
That just tell you like--

24:39.060 --> 24:41.146
even if she's smiling,
it would look like it would hurt

24:41.938 --> 24:43.648
the muscles in her face.

24:44.774 --> 24:46.484
I knew she was following me,
'cause she was at places

24:46.568 --> 24:47.527
that had nothing to do with her

24:47.611 --> 24:49.988
I'd be looking around like,
"What is this old bitch doing in Gamestop

24:50.071 --> 24:52.449
and Footlocker
and all the places I like to go?"

24:53.658 --> 24:55.785
Every time I see her,
she'd just be looking mean on me.

24:58.079 --> 24:59.623
And eventually I forgot about it.

24:59.706 --> 25:01.041
So, then after, I am shopping

25:01.124 --> 25:02.959
I go all the way to the back
of the parking lot,

25:03.043 --> 25:04.294
I'm parked all the way in the back

25:04.377 --> 25:07.464
and as soon as I open my car door
I hear a voice go,

25:07.547 --> 25:08.840
"David Chappelle."

25:09.382 --> 25:10.550
Just like that.

25:10.634 --> 25:12.552
I didn't even have to look,
I knew it was her.

25:13.261 --> 25:16.097
And I looked back and sure enough
there she was, that face.

25:17.432 --> 25:20.560
To be honest with you,
she probably wasn't even that old.

25:21.228 --> 25:23.063
She's probably around my age.

25:24.314 --> 25:27.317
But she was a White woman,
this bitch looked terrible.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.152
[laughter]

25:33.240 --> 25:34.532
I'm going all the way.

25:36.534 --> 25:40.121
I kept my cool, I was nice.
I said, "Hello, miss."

25:40.622 --> 25:43.124
And she didn't say anything back,
all she said was

25:43.208 --> 25:45.335
"I watch your comedy."

25:46.878 --> 25:48.296
I said "Oh-oh."

25:49.464 --> 25:51.383
And then she says,
this is true, she goes,

25:51.883 --> 25:53.385
"Sounds to me...

25:54.386 --> 25:58.139
like you, hate women."

26:01.059 --> 26:04.688
I said, "Well, you know what, miss?
It's art."

26:05.272 --> 26:08.191
You are free to interpret this art
however you like

26:08.275 --> 26:11.152
but I can tell you
as the maker of this art

26:11.236 --> 26:13.780
that I don't believe
that I feel that way.

26:13.863 --> 26:16.449
And she said, "Well, I think--"

26:16.533 --> 26:20.036
And I said, "Shut up, bitch!
Shut the fuck up!"

26:20.120 --> 26:21.288
[laughter]

26:21.955 --> 26:23.999
"Before I kill you
and put you in the trunk.

26:24.082 --> 26:25.667
Ain't nobody around here."

26:25.750 --> 26:27.502
[audience cheers]

26:31.840 --> 26:33.508
I'm just kidding, I didn't say that.

26:34.759 --> 26:36.761
I felt that way,
but that's not what I said.

26:38.138 --> 26:40.181
I was more clever than that.
You know what I said?

26:40.265 --> 26:41.474
And this is exactly what I said,
I said,

26:41.558 --> 26:44.227
"Miss, before you finish that statement,
let me ask you a question.

26:44.311 --> 26:45.603
Where did you see me?

26:46.563 --> 26:49.899
Did you buy a ticket to a concert
I did, I doubt that.

26:49.983 --> 26:55.030
Or, maybe you watched one of my specials
on Netflix.

26:55.113 --> 27:01.328
Or... Or... Did I follow you to your car
and do my act?"

27:02.245 --> 27:03.455
She said, "What?"

27:03.538 --> 27:07.625
I said, "Keep it in the comments section,
bitch, this is real life, ta-ta."

27:07.709 --> 27:09.336
[audience laughs]

27:10.045 --> 27:12.088
[applause]

27:15.675 --> 27:17.093
And then I drove off.

27:18.345 --> 27:19.637
And now I got to tell you

27:19.721 --> 27:22.474
and this is gonna surprise
some people here, but not everybody.

27:23.099 --> 27:25.060
People say things to me all the time

27:25.143 --> 27:27.771
but what you don't know,
is it does affect me.

27:27.854 --> 27:29.439
I think about it.

27:29.522 --> 27:32.150
And that one bothered me a lot,
I was driving home,

27:32.233 --> 27:34.110
couldn't stop thinking
about what this woman said

27:34.194 --> 27:37.197
because she is not the first woman
that said that to me.

27:37.947 --> 27:40.033
It's puzzling. You know what I mean?

27:40.116 --> 27:42.952
Like, what could I possibly be saying...

27:44.871 --> 27:47.540
that would make these bitches think,
I hate women.

27:47.624 --> 27:48.958
[laughter]

27:52.003 --> 27:53.213
Couldn't figure it out.

27:54.881 --> 27:56.132
So, you know what I did?

27:57.258 --> 27:59.969
I Googled the dictionary definition of a
feminist

28:00.053 --> 28:03.223
just to make sure,
I was talking about the right thing.

28:03.723 --> 28:05.642
And do you know, sir,

28:05.725 --> 28:08.978
what the dictionary definition
of a feminist is?

28:09.479 --> 28:12.148
I didn't either, listen to this.

28:13.441 --> 28:16.027
Webster's defines a feminist

28:16.694 --> 28:19.781
as a human being, not a woman,

28:20.281 --> 28:25.829
a human being, that believes
in equal rights for women.

28:25.912 --> 28:28.081
I was shocked,
'cause that is what that meant

28:28.164 --> 28:29.707
'cause by that definition

28:30.542 --> 28:34.879
I would consider myself a feminist,
and I didn't even know that at the time.

28:34.963 --> 28:36.548
[applause]

28:41.052 --> 28:45.598
All these years,
I thought it meant frumpy dyke.

28:45.682 --> 28:47.517
[audience laughs]

28:50.228 --> 28:54.691
Well, that seems always talking
to be some... chick in overalls,

28:54.774 --> 28:56.151
"Men are trying to rape us."

28:56.234 --> 28:58.319
"Ah, not you bitch, will you please..."

28:58.403 --> 29:00.113
[audience laughs]

29:07.454 --> 29:12.500
I know, look, listen, I support the
feminist movement, I do

29:12.584 --> 29:14.252
in my own ways.

29:14.335 --> 29:17.964
Well, you guys did the women's march,
I tried to go and support you

29:18.465 --> 29:20.508
and none of my friends would go with
me.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.677
I asked all the fellows,
none of them wanted to go.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.971
I tried everything. "Come on y'all,
there's gonna be bitches there."

29:25.054 --> 29:25.972
They was like, "Nope."

29:26.055 --> 29:27.932
[laughter]

29:29.642 --> 29:31.728
So what I did is,
I called my friend Anj.

29:31.811 --> 29:34.856
Anj is a Black woman
who is a comedy writer and she's dope.

29:34.939 --> 29:36.941
A matter of fact,
a matter of fact,

29:37.025 --> 29:40.069
she's the only woman,
that I know personally

29:40.153 --> 29:42.697
that pays her ex-husband alimony.

29:43.573 --> 29:45.825
And she sounds just like a man
when she does it.

29:45.909 --> 29:48.828
"Fuck that broke motherfucker"
and all that, she says all that shit.

29:49.537 --> 29:50.914
[applause]

29:52.248 --> 29:54.709
So I hit Anj up, I hit her on the
text

29:54.793 --> 29:56.044
and all I did, I texted. I said,

29:56.127 --> 29:58.588
"Anj, are you going to the women's
march?"

29:58.671 --> 30:02.509
And she texted me back,
and this is a real text, she said...

30:04.135 --> 30:07.013
she said, "I hope
those White bitches get tear gassed."

30:07.096 --> 30:09.140
[audience laughs]

30:17.524 --> 30:20.527
There is a problem
in that feminist movement, isn't there?

30:21.319 --> 30:23.822
From its inception in America

30:23.905 --> 30:25.949
there has always been a racial
component.

30:26.032 --> 30:28.576
When Susan B. Anthony
was having that meeting

30:28.660 --> 30:31.454
and Sojourner Truth's
Black ass showed up.

30:32.580 --> 30:34.040
Read your history books.

30:34.123 --> 30:37.794
All the White women
asked Sojourner Truth not to speak.

30:37.877 --> 30:41.673
They didn't conflate the issues
of women's rights and slavery.

30:42.632 --> 30:45.760
But you know how Black bitches are,
so Sojourner Truth went up there anyway.

30:45.843 --> 30:47.303
[laughter]

30:47.387 --> 30:49.430
[applause and cheering]

30:53.726 --> 30:56.563
She did a famous speech,
she said "Ain't I a woman?"

30:57.230 --> 30:58.773
"Ain't I a woman?"

30:59.399 --> 31:02.402
That's right. And listen, listen, listen.

31:02.485 --> 31:07.824
I supported the "Me Too" movement,
but the whole time, the whole time

31:07.907 --> 31:10.910
I thought that the way
they handled it was stupid.

31:12.996 --> 31:14.205
[laughter]

31:15.707 --> 31:17.917
It was, it was White, it was like...

31:21.379 --> 31:24.215
they were doing shit, like going to
the Golden Globes

31:24.299 --> 31:26.801
and all of them would be like
"Let's all go to the Golden Globes

31:26.885 --> 31:28.428
and wear black dresses.

31:28.511 --> 31:30.179
And give these men
a piece of our minds."

31:30.263 --> 31:31.931
Bitch, that is not gonna work.

31:33.391 --> 31:34.601
You think Martin Luther King
is gonna be like,

31:34.684 --> 31:38.396
"I want everybody to keep riding the bus,
but wear matching outfits."

31:38.897 --> 31:40.315
[laughter]

31:41.691 --> 31:43.610
You got to get off the bus and walk.

31:45.612 --> 31:46.905
It's real talk.

31:46.988 --> 31:49.449
A real talk, that was a silly
movement.

31:49.532 --> 31:51.784
"I want everybody to wear
crochet pussy hats

31:51.868 --> 31:53.328
so they know we are serious."

31:55.747 --> 31:57.332
What the fuck was y'all doing?

31:59.751 --> 32:02.003
And then I said something about it
in one of my specials

32:02.086 --> 32:04.464
and all these women actresses
came after me.

32:04.547 --> 32:06.257
I said, "Man,
fuck y'all too, you canceled.

32:06.341 --> 32:08.760
I ain't jerking off
to none of your pictures again."

32:08.843 --> 32:10.303
[laughter]

32:10.386 --> 32:11.971
[applause]

32:13.431 --> 32:16.726
They were like,
"Who is he to tell us anything?"

32:16.809 --> 32:18.728
I'll tell you exactly who I am.

32:20.229 --> 32:22.982
I'm the one that got off the bus

32:23.066 --> 32:26.736
and left $50 million
on the bus and walked.

32:27.236 --> 32:29.447
[cheers and applause]

32:34.994 --> 32:36.829
I agreed with these women.

32:36.913 --> 32:42.251
I just didn't agree
with what they were doing about it.

32:44.087 --> 32:47.882
Right. Right. No, it was annoying as
fuck...

32:49.550 --> 32:52.470
because if these women were serious,
you know what they would have done?

32:52.553 --> 32:55.014
They all would have fired their
agents.

32:55.098 --> 32:56.391
And they would have went
to the mailroom

32:56.474 --> 32:58.434
of one of these big agencies
and found a woman

32:58.518 --> 33:02.230
that was bustin' her hump in there
and said, "If you want to talk to us

33:02.313 --> 33:03.982
then you have to talk to her."

33:04.691 --> 33:06.275
And if they did that,

33:06.359 --> 33:08.653
then she would be big,
and they would be big

33:08.736 --> 33:11.197
and nobody would get fed to
Harvey Weinstein.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.657
But did they do that?

33:12.740 --> 33:14.784
-[audience] No!
-No.

33:15.284 --> 33:17.954
Was that their idea? No.

33:18.037 --> 33:20.248
Surprisingly it was mine.

33:22.583 --> 33:26.587
What I think, the feminist movement needs
to be very successful...

33:27.964 --> 33:29.549
is a male leader.

33:29.632 --> 33:31.426
[audience laughs]

33:33.636 --> 33:34.512
I'll do it.

33:36.097 --> 33:38.766
I will. I will lead you women
to the promised land.

33:39.392 --> 33:42.228
I will make sure
you will get equal pay for equal work.

33:42.311 --> 33:45.606
I will make sure that nobody harasses you
or fucks with you on the job.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.650
I will protect all of your interests.

33:47.734 --> 33:50.153
And all that I ask for in return...

33:51.738 --> 33:53.322
is that you suck my dick.

33:53.406 --> 33:55.033
[audience laughs]

33:56.534 --> 33:58.578
And now, we're right back to square one,
aren't we?

34:11.758 --> 34:13.760
And now we get to the core
of the crisis.

34:15.386 --> 34:16.345
What...

34:17.013 --> 34:18.473
what is a woman?

34:18.556 --> 34:20.850
What is that, in this day and time?

34:20.933 --> 34:24.145
Is there even such a thing
as a woman or a man or anything?

34:24.228 --> 34:25.938
Hmm. Hmm?

34:26.689 --> 34:28.608
Seems to be a question nowadays.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.486
Now listen, women get mad at me

34:32.153 --> 34:34.155
gay people get mad at me,
lesbians get mad at me,

34:34.238 --> 34:35.782
but I'm gonna tell you right now,
and this is true...

34:36.616 --> 34:38.117
these transgenders...

34:39.660 --> 34:41.287
the niggas want me dead.

34:41.370 --> 34:43.122
[laughter]

34:44.457 --> 34:46.751
I've gone too far,
I've said too much.

34:49.253 --> 34:50.963
But I got to tell you,
I'm very worried about it.

34:51.047 --> 34:52.381
I'm not even joking with you.

34:52.465 --> 34:54.675
Every time I come out onstage,
I be scared.

34:55.510 --> 34:58.513
I be lookin' around
the crowd, searching.

34:59.138 --> 35:00.640
For knuckles and Adam's apples

35:00.723 --> 35:02.975
to see where the threats might be
coming from.

35:08.481 --> 35:10.107
A nigga came up to me on the street
the other day.

35:10.191 --> 35:12.193
He said, "Careful, Dave, they after you."

35:12.276 --> 35:13.444
I said, "What?"

35:16.280 --> 35:19.283
"One they, or many theys?"

35:19.367 --> 35:20.868
[laughter]

35:32.171 --> 35:34.090
Before I even say anything
about that community

35:34.173 --> 35:36.592
you must know and I hope
you all feel the same way

35:36.676 --> 35:39.303
I am not indifferent

35:39.387 --> 35:41.556
to the suffering of someone else.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.725
There's laws, the mean laws
in our country.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.477
North Carolina passed a law once.

35:46.561 --> 35:49.647
They said a person in North Carolina
must use the restroom

35:49.730 --> 35:53.234
that corresponds with the gender
they were assigned

35:53.317 --> 35:54.777
on their birth certificate.

35:56.445 --> 35:57.572
No, no, no, no.

35:59.031 --> 36:02.326
No, that is not a good law.
That is a mean law.

36:03.119 --> 36:06.789
No American should have
to present a birth certificate

36:06.873 --> 36:10.126
to take a shit at Walmart,
in Greensboro, North Carolina

36:10.209 --> 36:12.378
where DaBaby shot and killed
a motherfucker.

36:12.461 --> 36:14.422
[applause]

36:17.925 --> 36:20.511
You have to ask yourself,
if you're thinking about it,

36:20.595 --> 36:23.055
who are these laws
designed to protect?

36:23.764 --> 36:26.350
Like let's say they designed this law
to protect me,

36:26.434 --> 36:30.813
my interests, transphobic comedian,
Dave Chappelle.

36:33.482 --> 36:38.404
Let's say I'm in Walmart,
doing a little shopping with my family.

36:38.988 --> 36:40.698
Now I should tell you

36:40.781 --> 36:43.701
if that ever happens in real life,
you should know

36:44.827 --> 36:46.746
my dreams didn't work out.

36:46.829 --> 36:48.414
[laughter]

36:50.458 --> 36:52.126
Well let's say
something goes horribly wrong

36:52.210 --> 36:55.171
and there I'm in Walmart
with the poor Whites

36:55.254 --> 36:58.883
rummaging around
for mediocre goods and services.

36:58.966 --> 37:00.426
[audience laughs]

37:04.096 --> 37:05.723
And then I got to go to the restroom.

37:06.599 --> 37:09.268
So, I excuse myself from my family.
I go to the men's room.

37:09.352 --> 37:11.646
Now I'm standing at the urinal,
taking a leak.

37:11.729 --> 37:14.482
And this is what this law is gonna do.

37:15.149 --> 37:17.735
And suddenly a woman

37:18.361 --> 37:19.612
walks into the men's room.

37:19.695 --> 37:21.739
I'm like, that's strange.

37:23.616 --> 37:26.118
And then she stands
shoulder to shoulder

37:26.202 --> 37:28.829
with me at the urinal, I'm gonna be like,
"Bitch, what's going on with you?"

37:28.913 --> 37:30.206
[laughter]

37:31.165 --> 37:32.875
And then she hikes her skirt up

37:33.709 --> 37:38.089
and she pulls a real live,
meaty dick out!

37:38.172 --> 37:39.674
[laughter]

37:40.716 --> 37:42.593
What do you think I am going to say?

37:46.222 --> 37:47.932
Thank God, she's in here with me.

37:50.309 --> 37:52.728
At least now I know
my family is safe.

37:54.939 --> 37:56.190
Mm-mm.

37:56.274 --> 37:59.068
No, I'm not gonna feel that way at all,
I'm gonna feel very uncomfortable.

37:59.777 --> 38:03.447
I would feel better if it was a man
with a vagina

38:05.574 --> 38:07.702
that backed up
to the urinal next to me.

38:07.785 --> 38:09.453
[audience laughs]

38:13.165 --> 38:16.168
I wouldn't even think about that,
I'd just be like, "That's funny."

38:16.252 --> 38:17.378
[audience laughs]

38:18.796 --> 38:21.007
"This guy is peeing out of his butt
for some reason."

38:24.260 --> 38:27.430
"Oh my God, he must be a Veteran,
thank you for your service."

38:36.314 --> 38:40.526
I'm not indifferent to people's suffering
'cause I know it's hard to be everybody.

38:40.609 --> 38:43.612
We Blacks, we just got
our first big holiday in a long time.

38:43.696 --> 38:46.157
Happy belated Juneteenth
to the Blacks.

38:46.240 --> 38:49.201
[cheers and applause]

38:53.039 --> 38:55.499
Juneteenth is a strange holiday,
isn't it?

38:55.583 --> 38:57.626
-[audience] Yes.
-It commemorates

38:57.710 --> 39:01.005
when Black people in Texarkana area
of the country

39:01.088 --> 39:02.673
first found out that they were free.

39:02.757 --> 39:06.385
But remember, they were free
when they found out.

39:06.927 --> 39:09.346
They just didn't know it yet.

39:10.306 --> 39:13.184
Very interesting holiday.

39:13.267 --> 39:14.602
You know, I learned something

39:15.644 --> 39:17.188
This is a wild story.

39:18.522 --> 39:20.900
I learned this past Juneteenth
of a story, this is true.

39:20.983 --> 39:23.903
And it's that there was a Black man
who was in South Carolina

39:23.986 --> 39:25.446
during slavery

39:25.529 --> 39:30.117
who somehow got granted his freedom
by his so-called master.

39:31.035 --> 39:33.079
And when his master granted him
the freedom

39:33.162 --> 39:34.705
he also gave him a plot of land.

39:34.789 --> 39:36.582
Now it turns out,
this brother was brilliant.

39:36.665 --> 39:39.502
He had a good eye,
good knack for farming.

39:39.585 --> 39:42.546
And he farmed this plot of land
very successfully

39:42.630 --> 39:46.217
and made a lot of money,
and this is where the story gets crazy.

39:46.967 --> 39:48.511
When he got all that money...

39:51.388 --> 39:53.641
this nigga brought some slaves.

39:53.724 --> 39:55.017
[laughter]

39:55.559 --> 39:57.728
Have you ever heard this before?
This is a true story.

39:57.812 --> 40:00.856
Not only was he a slave owner,
he became a slave breeder.

40:00.940 --> 40:03.109
And employed tactics that were so
cruel

40:03.192 --> 40:07.154
even White slave owners were like,
"Yo, my man."

40:07.238 --> 40:08.447
[laughter]

40:08.531 --> 40:10.157
He was a wild dude, but he did it

40:10.241 --> 40:13.285
just because that's what successful people
did at the time.

40:13.369 --> 40:16.997
He just wanted to be down,
what a fuckin' tragedy.

40:17.081 --> 40:18.791
How can a person

40:18.874 --> 40:20.334
that went through slavery

40:20.417 --> 40:23.796
perpetuate the same evil
on a person that looks just like him.

40:23.879 --> 40:25.005
It's mind blowing.

40:25.089 --> 40:29.093
And shockingly,
they're making a movie about him.

40:30.177 --> 40:34.598
Ironically... it is called <i>Space Jews.</i>

40:34.682 --> 40:36.934
[audience laughs]

40:37.017 --> 40:38.644
[cheers]

40:40.980 --> 40:42.440
<i>Space Jews.</i>

40:45.484 --> 40:47.153
[distant chuckling]

40:50.531 --> 40:51.740
The point of that story is

40:51.824 --> 40:54.326
this person was invested
in a construct.

40:54.410 --> 40:56.745
That was the construct
of successful people

40:56.829 --> 40:59.582
and he just followed the roadmap
of successful people.

40:59.665 --> 41:02.877
He followed what they called
"an incentive."

41:02.960 --> 41:05.629
Now, everyone struggles

41:06.797 --> 41:08.299
but I'm very invested

41:09.758 --> 41:12.636
in the gender construct, personally.

41:12.720 --> 41:15.598
'Cause I'm a man with kids,
and a wife, and

41:16.473 --> 41:20.519
I like that warm, wet soft pussy
that my wife has.

41:22.646 --> 41:24.106
[applause]

41:24.648 --> 41:28.903
This does not mean that I feel like
another point of view

41:30.237 --> 41:31.739
can't exist.

41:33.616 --> 41:35.618
I was doing a night club in Oakland,
16 years ago

41:35.701 --> 41:37.161
and this was the first time

41:37.244 --> 41:39.788
that the trans community
ever got mad at me that I knew about.

41:39.872 --> 41:42.166
And then I was nobody,
I had just quit <i>Chappelle Show.</i>

41:42.249 --> 41:44.168
It was like a nothing
hole in the wall club

41:44.251 --> 41:48.172
and I was doing some transgender jokes
in Oakland, it was 16 years ago.

41:48.255 --> 41:51.050
My pronoun game
was not as nice as it is today.

41:52.092 --> 41:53.802
I went too far, I said things like

41:53.886 --> 41:56.847
tranny and shit I didn't know these words
were bad, and a woman stood up

41:56.931 --> 41:58.557
and just gave me the business.

41:58.641 --> 42:00.601
Started screaming at me,
and I'm sure it was a woman.

42:00.684 --> 42:04.104
But she kept calling me
transphobic and all this shit

42:04.188 --> 42:06.982
I had never even heard these words before,
it was really weird.

42:07.066 --> 42:08.943
I didn't trip, I just gazed
at Security

42:09.026 --> 42:11.195
to look like, "Go on,
get that bitch out of here."

42:11.278 --> 42:12.613
[audience laughs]

42:15.282 --> 42:16.450
I kept it moving.

42:17.034 --> 42:18.327
And then she went to the press.

42:18.410 --> 42:20.246
The next day one
of the gay papers wrote

42:20.329 --> 42:23.791
all of the same things she had said to me,
about me in the paper.

42:23.874 --> 42:26.502
Misquoted the jokes,
and was calling me transphobic

42:26.585 --> 42:28.879
you know, these words,
I had never heard them before but

42:28.963 --> 42:32.299
every time that I talked with anybody
from the community since

42:32.383 --> 42:35.052
they always repeat the talking points
from that article.

42:35.135 --> 42:38.305
My least favorite of which being,
I hate this phrase

42:38.389 --> 42:42.726
they say, "I was punching down on
them."

42:43.435 --> 42:46.855
"Punching down",
what the fuck does that mean?

42:48.357 --> 42:49.984
Now fast forward.

42:50.901 --> 42:52.653
It is 2019.

42:53.779 --> 42:56.991
And I am in a restaurant in Ohio,
very nice restaurant.

42:57.074 --> 42:58.701
It's Thanksgiving week.

42:59.618 --> 43:02.830
And to be honest,
it is not a very nice restaurant, but

43:03.831 --> 43:06.875
it is a nice restaurant,
if you're a White person from Ohio

43:06.959 --> 43:08.752
that has never been anywhere before.

43:08.836 --> 43:10.296
[laughter]

43:10.379 --> 43:11.880
Picture Chili's.

43:11.964 --> 43:13.757
[audience laughs]

43:17.052 --> 43:19.555
I'm sitting in the bar,
I'm having a drink by myself

43:19.638 --> 43:22.766
and the only other person in the bar
is a woman, a couple of stools down.

43:22.850 --> 43:25.686
And she was alone, and she was older,
and that made me feel sad,

43:25.769 --> 43:27.313
'cause it was the holidays.

43:27.396 --> 43:30.524
So, I told the bartender,
"Send that woman a drink on me."

43:30.607 --> 43:33.402
Just trying to spread the cheer,
and I wish I didn't.

43:35.195 --> 43:36.655
This woman wanted to talk.

43:37.489 --> 43:40.492
She wasn't mean, she was nice,
but she just wanted to talk about shit

43:40.576 --> 43:42.119
that you know, I mean a nigga
just trying to get drunk

43:42.202 --> 43:44.413
don't want to hear about this bitch
remodeling in her bathroom.

43:44.496 --> 43:46.457
And I'm sitting there,
trying to be polite.

43:46.540 --> 43:48.667
Oh, subway tiles? Word.

43:52.296 --> 43:53.839
But then she hits a lick.

43:55.257 --> 43:56.759
Piqued my interest.

43:57.885 --> 44:00.137
She says, "My daughter is coming home
for the holidays."

44:00.220 --> 44:02.681
Like, "Oh, that is great news,
I'm glad you're not going to be alone."

44:03.599 --> 44:06.477
And then she goes on and on
about how great her daughter is.

44:06.560 --> 44:09.772
I guess her daughter got a new agent
and she is out in Hollywood,

44:09.855 --> 44:12.566
she's in movies and on television
and all this stuff

44:12.650 --> 44:16.028
and as she's telling me this,
I'm thinking, this woman is so sweet.

44:16.111 --> 44:18.447
She probably doesn't even know who I
am.

44:19.156 --> 44:20.949
Or what I do for a living

44:21.742 --> 44:23.243
because I know

44:24.286 --> 44:26.789
what your daughter's
is out in Hollywood doing.

44:26.872 --> 44:28.123
[laughter]

44:31.669 --> 44:33.462
And then she goes,
"Would you like to see her picture?"

44:33.545 --> 44:35.047
"Oh now I don't want to see
this woman's picture,

44:35.130 --> 44:35.964
but what am I gonna do?"

44:36.048 --> 44:38.550
I'm like, "Okay sure,
I'd love to see the picture."

44:38.634 --> 44:42.012
And I grab the picture
and this is all I say, this is all I say,

44:42.096 --> 44:43.597
"Oh...

44:44.973 --> 44:46.433
she is very beautiful."

44:47.267 --> 44:48.811
And as she puts the picture away

44:48.894 --> 44:53.273
she... looks mean all of a sudden,
like she caught me in some kind of trap.

44:53.357 --> 44:57.528
"What did that face mean?"
And then she goes, "She's transgender."

45:00.197 --> 45:03.951
And I think to myself, "Oh, this bitch
does know who I am."

45:04.034 --> 45:06.161
[audience laughs]

45:11.125 --> 45:12.668
I really resented that trap

45:12.751 --> 45:14.837
because that trap
doesn't let me be honest.

45:14.920 --> 45:16.547
If I was honest,
I wouldn't have fallen for it.

45:16.630 --> 45:18.340
I'd have just looked at the picture
like,

45:18.424 --> 45:22.136
"Look at that big chiseled jawline,
that big thick Joe Rogan neck.

45:22.219 --> 45:23.887
Is that a dude?

45:25.139 --> 45:26.890
Is your daughter a man?"

45:28.684 --> 45:30.185
Can't say that shit.

45:32.312 --> 45:33.814
It's really annoying.

45:37.276 --> 45:39.528
Fast forward,
now it's a couple of days later.

45:40.446 --> 45:42.030
It's the Wednesday...

45:44.283 --> 45:46.034
before the Thursday that's Thanksgiving,

45:46.118 --> 45:47.703
and I'm in a totally different bar

45:47.786 --> 45:51.665
and this bar, trust me,
is not a nice place.

45:52.458 --> 45:55.335
It's foul, it's one of those bars
where the top shelf

45:55.419 --> 45:56.503
should be under the sink.

45:56.587 --> 45:58.213
[laughter]

45:59.840 --> 46:02.843
This is where the poor Whites drink.
The Tiki torch Whites.

46:04.052 --> 46:06.722
You know what I mean?
Them White people, they believe in "Q"

46:06.805 --> 46:10.100
and they love Trump. You know what I
mean? Like Michigan White people.

46:10.184 --> 46:11.977
[audience cheers]

46:12.561 --> 46:14.438
[applause]

46:20.402 --> 46:23.197
I remember I was at this bar one time,
it was that kind of bar it is.

46:23.280 --> 46:24.781
I was in there one time,
I was fucked up

46:24.865 --> 46:26.617
and I turned around
to everybody in the bar

46:26.700 --> 46:29.536
and go "Hey everybody, I am going to buy
everyone in the bar a round of drinks."

46:29.620 --> 46:31.914
And all the motherfuckers
was like, "Hurrah!"

46:31.997 --> 46:34.166
And the bartender knew I was drunk,
so she pulled me aside.

46:34.249 --> 46:37.211
"Mr. Chappelle, are you sure about
that?"

46:38.003 --> 46:40.839
That's going to be 16 dollars.

46:40.923 --> 46:42.633
[laughter]

46:43.217 --> 46:44.801
[applause]

46:46.220 --> 46:47.721
Tough time for the Whites.

46:51.225 --> 46:53.185
And this was a holiday weekend.
You know what I mean?

46:53.268 --> 46:55.687
These motherfuckers
were having a rootin' tootin' time.

46:55.771 --> 46:57.981
They was in there partying,
making all them noises.

46:58.065 --> 47:01.068
"Ooh! Ow! Yeow!"

47:01.151 --> 47:03.111
You know all them noises
White people make before lynching?

47:03.195 --> 47:04.738
They was doing all that shit.

47:04.821 --> 47:06.198
[audience laughs]

47:09.743 --> 47:10.827
I was drunk.

47:12.079 --> 47:14.790
I looked over my shoulder,
I thought I was trippin'.

47:14.873 --> 47:16.250
Guess who was in the bar?

47:16.333 --> 47:19.086
I thought I was seeing things,
I looked across the room

47:19.670 --> 47:21.046
and I saw...

47:22.422 --> 47:24.758
the trans-bitch from the picture.

47:24.841 --> 47:26.260
[laughter]

47:26.969 --> 47:28.428
I couldn't believe it.

47:28.512 --> 47:31.265
I said "What is a trans person,
doing in a place like this?

47:31.348 --> 47:33.475
This is very dangerous behavior."

47:34.685 --> 47:40.315
And she was with, two big, buff,
gay Black dudes.

47:40.399 --> 47:42.609
I didn't know these dudes,
but I know they was gay.

47:44.194 --> 47:46.113
If they had a dick in their mouth,
they wouldn't look any gayer

47:46.196 --> 47:47.447
than they did just sitting there.

47:47.531 --> 47:48.490
[laughter]

47:49.199 --> 47:51.785
They had 1980s gay face.
You know what that is?

47:51.868 --> 47:52.703
Remember in the '80s

47:52.786 --> 47:54.538
when gay people looked surprised
all the time.

47:55.539 --> 47:57.124
[audience laughs]

47:58.625 --> 48:00.085
[applause]

48:01.795 --> 48:04.423
"Close your mouth, nigga,
what is surprising", you know what I mean?

48:05.340 --> 48:08.135
But they was huge, they looked like
Jussie Smollett's trainers.

48:08.218 --> 48:09.761
[laughter]

48:11.722 --> 48:14.391
And I am thinking, "Man these
motherfuckers are in a lot of trouble."

48:14.474 --> 48:16.101
So what I do is I stand up

48:16.184 --> 48:19.187
and everybody in the bar likes me,
so I make a big show of it

48:19.271 --> 48:20.814
to make sure that everyone can hear
me.

48:20.897 --> 48:22.482
Now, I walk right up to her,
and I go

48:22.566 --> 48:26.236
"Hey! I just met your mother
the other night

48:26.320 --> 48:28.614
and she told me all the great things
you're doing in Hollywood.

48:28.697 --> 48:30.032
And I cannot believe
that someone

48:30.115 --> 48:31.783
from a podunk place like this

48:31.867 --> 48:34.411
can achieve all that, I'm so proud
of you.

48:34.494 --> 48:35.704
Welcome home."

48:35.787 --> 48:38.123
And the whole bar said "Hurrah!"

48:39.791 --> 48:41.335
And I said "Phew."

48:42.586 --> 48:44.254
"That ought to buy her some time."

48:46.089 --> 48:47.132
You know what I mean?

48:47.215 --> 48:49.551
A couple of more drinks
and these fellows are gonna start

48:50.135 --> 48:52.512
asking her for some pussy,
she might not have.

48:52.596 --> 48:54.097
[laughter]

48:59.895 --> 49:01.938
And she was very gracious.

49:02.022 --> 49:04.191
She said "Thank you so much",
and we shook hands

49:04.274 --> 49:07.736
and as she was shaking my hand,
her face turned mean, like her mom's.

49:09.613 --> 49:14.159
And she said, "Do you mind, not punching
down on my people?"

49:14.701 --> 49:16.203
Oh, I don't like that.

49:16.828 --> 49:18.997
Normally, I would've let it go,
but I was drunk.

49:19.081 --> 49:20.165
[laughter]

49:20.791 --> 49:22.959
I said, "What might you mean, bitch?"

49:23.043 --> 49:24.419
[audience laughs]

49:25.879 --> 49:28.757
I was careful to call her a bitch,
'cause I didn't want to blow her cover.

49:28.840 --> 49:30.384
[audience laughs]

49:32.386 --> 49:34.054
Turns out she wasn't hiding.

49:34.805 --> 49:36.348
She was loud, she was proud.

49:37.015 --> 49:38.684
She let me have it
in front of everybody.

49:38.767 --> 49:41.061
Screaming at me, all the talking points
from that article.

49:41.144 --> 49:42.646
You transphobic, this and that.

49:42.729 --> 49:44.272
Kept clapping her hands
in my face.

49:44.356 --> 49:45.691
"Let me tell you somethin'."

49:45.774 --> 49:47.442
I said, "Where did you learn this from,
Black bitches?" She kept going,

49:47.526 --> 49:50.404
"Let me tell you something, honey."

49:51.697 --> 49:52.948
So annoying.

49:55.283 --> 49:58.078
She kept calling transgenders, her
people.

49:58.161 --> 50:01.373
Ain't that weird?
"My people this, my people that."

50:01.456 --> 50:03.417
I said, "What do you mean, your
people?"

50:03.500 --> 50:07.170
Were you all kidnapped in Transylvanian,
brought here as slaves?

50:07.254 --> 50:08.797
[laughter]

50:12.509 --> 50:16.888
She said, "My people have struggled
for decades, honey, decades."

50:16.972 --> 50:19.683
And I looked at them
gay Black dudes, like.

50:19.766 --> 50:22.728
"Is there anything
you niggas need to tell this bitch?

50:22.811 --> 50:23.854
[laughter]

50:23.937 --> 50:25.439
Clifford, Clifford?"

50:25.522 --> 50:26.898
[audience laughs]

50:31.778 --> 50:33.989
I am exaggerating,
she is actually a very nice person

50:34.072 --> 50:37.909
and I'm cool with her now,
but boy, that shit got on my nerves.

50:38.702 --> 50:41.204
And it got on my nerves because, whenever
someone says that to me

50:41.288 --> 50:44.958
I know they have never seen me
for themselves, they just repeat

50:45.041 --> 50:46.376
what they've heard.

50:46.460 --> 50:49.588
Any of you, who have ever watched me
know

50:50.130 --> 50:55.177
that I've never had a problem
with transgender people.

50:55.719 --> 50:58.889
If you listen to what I'm saying, clearly

50:58.972 --> 51:03.018
my problem
has always been with White people.

51:03.101 --> 51:05.061
[audience laughs]

51:05.812 --> 51:07.564
[applause]

51:09.733 --> 51:13.195
I've been arguing with the Whites
my entire career.

51:14.029 --> 51:15.781
Just when I thought I had you guys
on the ropes

51:15.864 --> 51:16.698
you changed all the rules.

51:16.782 --> 51:17.949
"Oh yeah?"

51:18.033 --> 51:20.243
-Yeah, motherfucker!
-"Well."

51:22.120 --> 51:24.748
I am a girl now, nigger.
You must treat me as such.

51:24.831 --> 51:26.082
[audience laughs]

51:28.710 --> 51:30.420
"Call me a girl, nigger."

51:33.882 --> 51:35.509
It's annoying as fuck.

51:36.927 --> 51:39.679
No, no, go back, go back

51:39.763 --> 51:42.724
tonight after the show,
watch every special I did on Netflix.

51:42.808 --> 51:45.268
Listen to everything
I've ever said about that community.

51:45.352 --> 51:46.269
I'll go through 'em.

51:46.353 --> 51:49.064
I said, "How much do I have to participate
in your self image?"

51:49.147 --> 51:51.316
I said, "You shouldn't discuss this
in front of Black people."

51:51.399 --> 51:54.277
I said, "I know niggas in Brooklyn
that wear high heels just to feel safe."

51:54.361 --> 51:57.280
I asked you "Why is it easier
for Bruce Jenner

51:57.364 --> 51:58.657
to change his gender

51:58.740 --> 52:01.827
than it is for Cassius Clay
to change his name?"

52:01.910 --> 52:04.204
[audience cheers]

52:04.287 --> 52:05.622
[applause]

52:06.581 --> 52:10.919
If you listen to what I'm saying,
I'm not even talking about them,

52:11.002 --> 52:16.591
I'm talking about us
and "they don't listen."

52:18.927 --> 52:20.387
It's very annoying.

52:21.847 --> 52:25.267
And they have canceled people,
more powerful than me.

52:26.393 --> 52:28.353
They canceled J.K. Rowling, my God.

52:28.436 --> 52:31.773
J.K. Rowling wrote
all the Harry Potter books by herself.

52:33.483 --> 52:36.236
She sold so many books,
the Bible worries about her.

52:36.319 --> 52:37.737
[laughter]

52:39.614 --> 52:41.575
And they canceled it because,
she said in an interview

52:41.658 --> 52:44.661
and this is not exactly what she said,
but effectually she said

52:45.328 --> 52:47.080
that gender was a fact.

52:47.998 --> 52:50.083
And then the trans community
got mad as shit,

52:50.166 --> 52:52.043
they started calling her a TERF.

52:52.127 --> 52:53.920
I didn't even know,
what the fuck that was.

52:54.713 --> 52:58.925
But I know that trans people make up words
to win arguments.

52:59.009 --> 53:00.218
[laughter]

53:02.846 --> 53:04.014
So I looked it up.

53:05.432 --> 53:07.142
TERF is an acronym.

53:07.225 --> 53:09.936
It stands for Trans-exclusionary
radical feminist.

53:10.020 --> 53:12.105
This is a real thing,
this is a group of women...

53:13.440 --> 53:14.441
that hate transgender.

53:14.524 --> 53:15.859
They don't hate transgender women but

53:15.942 --> 53:17.110
they look at trans women

53:17.193 --> 53:19.404
the way we Blacks
might look at Black face.

53:19.487 --> 53:23.033
It offends them like, "Oh, this bitch
is doing an impression of me."

53:23.116 --> 53:24.534
[laughter]

53:28.705 --> 53:30.415
Now I shouldn't speak on this

53:31.374 --> 53:34.586
because I'm not a woman
nor am I a trans.

53:35.462 --> 53:37.005
But as we've established...

53:38.548 --> 53:40.008
I am a feminist.

53:40.091 --> 53:41.384
[laughter]

53:41.927 --> 53:43.011
That's right.

53:43.094 --> 53:44.804
[applause]

53:48.308 --> 53:49.809
I'm team TERF.

53:50.852 --> 53:51.978
I agree.

53:53.021 --> 53:54.773
I agree, man.

53:54.856 --> 53:57.108
Gender is a fact.

53:57.192 --> 54:00.070
You have to look at it
from a woman's perspective.

54:00.153 --> 54:02.364
Look at it like this,
Caitlyn Jenner

54:02.447 --> 54:04.491
whom I have met, wonderful person.

54:04.574 --> 54:10.038
Caitlyn Jenner... was voted,
woman of the year.

54:10.538 --> 54:13.333
Her first year as a woman.

54:13.416 --> 54:14.501
Ain't that something?

54:14.584 --> 54:17.837
Beat every bitch in Detroit.
She's better than all of you.

54:17.921 --> 54:19.255
[laughter]

54:19.339 --> 54:21.841
Never even had a period,
ain't that something?

54:21.925 --> 54:23.385
[laughter]

54:23.468 --> 54:26.471
I'd be mad as shit if I was a woman.
I'd be mad if I was me.

54:26.554 --> 54:28.682
If I was in the BET awards,
sitting there and they're like

54:28.765 --> 54:33.728
"And the winner for
nigger of the year... Eminem."

54:33.812 --> 54:34.813
My man.

54:34.896 --> 54:36.898
[audience laughs]

54:43.029 --> 54:44.739
Gender is a fact, this is a fact.

54:44.823 --> 54:47.909
Every human being in this room,
every human being on Earth

54:47.993 --> 54:51.830
had to pass through the legs of a woman
to be on Earth.

54:51.913 --> 54:55.208
That is a fact.

54:55.291 --> 54:56.751
[laughter]

54:57.460 --> 54:58.461
Now...

55:00.505 --> 55:06.302
I am not saying that to say,
that trans women aren't women.

55:07.012 --> 55:10.849
I'm just sayin,
that those pussies that they got...

55:13.560 --> 55:14.978
You know what I mean?

55:15.061 --> 55:16.730
[audience laughs]

55:17.397 --> 55:19.024
[applause]

55:22.318 --> 55:25.280
I'm not saying it is not pussy,
but that's like

55:25.363 --> 55:28.366
Beyond Pussy or Impossible Pussy.
You know what I mean?

55:28.450 --> 55:32.162
It tastes like pussy
but that's not quite what it is, is it?

55:33.204 --> 55:35.248
It's not blood, that is beet juice.

55:35.331 --> 55:36.541
[laughter]

55:44.049 --> 55:45.842
Oh buddy, I'm in trouble now.

55:45.925 --> 55:47.218
[audience laughs]

55:54.267 --> 55:55.894
Before I go, I want
to share this story with you

55:55.977 --> 55:57.771
because it is important
to this point.

56:00.482 --> 56:03.777
I want your community to know
that one of the coolest people I ever met

56:04.277 --> 56:05.820
was a transgender woman.

56:05.904 --> 56:08.281
And this is not a man that I knew

56:08.364 --> 56:12.368
that became a woman, this woman was
trans when I met her.

56:12.452 --> 56:15.580
Lived in San Francisco,
Daphne Dwarman is the name.

56:16.581 --> 56:19.125
I would do 18 shows in the Bay Area

56:19.209 --> 56:22.128
sometimes in Oakland
and Dirty Hood night club

56:22.212 --> 56:25.048
and she would be there,
white trans woman, laughing

56:25.131 --> 56:27.759
loud and hard, at everything I said.

56:27.842 --> 56:30.678
Especially the trans jokes,
very puzzling...

56:32.430 --> 56:34.516
because she was obviously trans.

56:36.518 --> 56:38.686
And one night
after one of the shows I met her.

56:39.729 --> 56:42.690
And what it was, turns out

56:43.358 --> 56:45.401
it was her dream to be a comedian.

56:45.944 --> 56:47.737
And I was her hero.

56:47.821 --> 56:48.696
It was very moving.

56:48.780 --> 56:52.992
I could not dislike somebody
that felt that way about me.

56:53.076 --> 56:54.619
We became fast friends.

56:55.245 --> 56:57.622
And when I made that
special <i>Sticks and Stones</i>

56:57.705 --> 57:00.708
right as it was coming out,
I happened to be in San Francisco

57:00.792 --> 57:02.085
and I wanted to do a show.

57:02.168 --> 57:04.712
But I needed an opening act,
and I remembered...

57:05.839 --> 57:08.675
that trans woman I had met,
so I called her on the phone.

57:09.551 --> 57:11.010
And I called her myself,

57:11.094 --> 57:12.637
I said, "Hey Daphne,
this is Dave Chappelle."

57:12.720 --> 57:14.264
She couldn't believe it.

57:14.347 --> 57:16.099
And I go, "I'm in San Francisco."

57:16.182 --> 57:18.810
And then she started saying
a bunch of wild stuff, I was like

57:18.893 --> 57:21.354
"Relax now,
I don't want any pussy, I was...

57:21.437 --> 57:23.022
[laughter]

57:27.026 --> 57:30.321
I'm just calling, because I'm doing
a show and I need an opening act.

57:30.989 --> 57:32.699
And I was wondering
if you'd open the show?"

57:32.782 --> 57:34.826
And she was like, "Fuck, yeah."

57:34.909 --> 57:38.329
Now... I didn't know this at the time

57:38.413 --> 57:42.292
but this woman had only done
stand up comedy eight times in her life.

57:42.375 --> 57:44.377
This was little to no experience

57:44.461 --> 57:48.756
and now she's about to open a show
for what many call the GOAT.

57:50.049 --> 57:53.136
[audience cheers]

57:53.219 --> 57:55.763
[applause]

58:03.062 --> 58:05.899
She's an amateur in stature, but

58:05.982 --> 58:08.193
in practice,
she was very professional.

58:08.276 --> 58:10.486
She showed up early,
which is something I appreciate

58:10.570 --> 58:12.322
'cause I like people to be on time.

58:12.405 --> 58:15.408
She was dressed
to the motherfuckin' nines, I mean,

58:15.491 --> 58:18.578
I'm transphobic and even I was like,
"You look nice."

58:18.661 --> 58:20.038
[laughter]

58:23.791 --> 58:27.003
Went up on the stage with all the swag
of a professional comedian,

58:27.086 --> 58:29.464
grabbed that mic
and walked right down the middle

58:29.547 --> 58:33.009
and looked at the crowd like a gangster.
Man, you should have seen her work.

58:33.843 --> 58:36.638
This bitch bombed
for 45 minutes, straight.

58:36.721 --> 58:38.014
[cheers]

58:38.973 --> 58:42.519
And I'm not exaggerating, young man.
That show was terrible.

58:43.770 --> 58:44.646
Stunk.

58:47.357 --> 58:48.191
Stunk.

58:48.733 --> 58:50.443
And then she brings me on,
and you know,

58:50.527 --> 58:52.862
I was like a glass of water
after a handful of salt.

58:52.946 --> 58:54.614
The crowd was happy to see me.

58:54.697 --> 58:55.615
I was killing it.

58:58.117 --> 58:59.661
But here is what impressed me.

59:00.245 --> 59:04.374
Any other comedian I've ever seen,
if they had bombed as bad as she did,

59:04.457 --> 59:07.919
would have snuck out of the back
of the theatre and went home and cried

59:08.002 --> 59:09.379
or something, but she didn't do that.

59:09.462 --> 59:11.005
Not only did she not leave,

59:11.089 --> 59:13.675
she found a seat, right up in front.

59:13.758 --> 59:16.761
You know, when a new comedian
watches an experienced comedian

59:16.844 --> 59:18.846
in comedy we call this "taking class."

59:18.930 --> 59:21.766
And this bitch took my whole class,
she sat up there

59:21.849 --> 59:24.852
and was laughing as hard
as she always laughs

59:24.936 --> 59:27.188
as if nothing bad
had even happened to her.

59:27.272 --> 59:30.692
And I saw her show.
Something bad happened to her.

59:30.775 --> 59:31.859
[audience laughs]

59:35.446 --> 59:36.489
She was drunk.

59:38.032 --> 59:40.201
So she starts talking to me,
while I'm onstage

59:40.285 --> 59:43.538
but the way a person would talk
to a television when they were alone.

59:43.621 --> 59:44.539
She was talking to me like that.

59:44.622 --> 59:46.249
That didn't bother me
'cause I knew her.

59:46.332 --> 59:48.876
But the crowd didn't like that shit
at all 'cause she sucked.

59:51.629 --> 59:53.673
And a guy in the back of the room
stood up

59:53.756 --> 59:56.259
and Daphne's hair
was dyed blonde at the time

59:56.342 --> 59:59.429
and the guy screamed out,
and his energy felt wild as fuck.

59:59.512 --> 1:00:01.347
He said, "Hey Daphne!"
and everybody got clamped,

1:00:01.431 --> 1:00:02.473
they got tense.

1:00:02.557 --> 1:00:05.643
We didn't know who was a heckler
or active shooter, and...

1:00:05.727 --> 1:00:07.186
[laughter]

1:00:08.438 --> 1:00:10.398
...he said,

1:00:11.107 --> 1:00:13.651
"Does the carpet match the drapes?"

1:00:15.153 --> 1:00:16.654
It was fucked up.

1:00:16.738 --> 1:00:20.867
The whole crowd kind of groaned,
'cause it was so like, mean.

1:00:20.950 --> 1:00:23.911
Everybody groaned, except for Daphne.

1:00:23.995 --> 1:00:26.289
She kind of laughed, which was weird.

1:00:26.372 --> 1:00:28.333
And she didn't even look all the way
back.

1:00:28.416 --> 1:00:31.002
She said, "Sir, I don't have carpets

1:00:31.085 --> 1:00:33.296
I have hardwood floors."
Just like that.

1:00:33.379 --> 1:00:34.255
[laughter]

1:00:34.797 --> 1:00:36.215
Just like that.

1:00:36.299 --> 1:00:37.759
[applause]

1:00:39.969 --> 1:00:43.222
Boy, when she said that shit,
it blew the roof of the place.

1:00:44.390 --> 1:00:47.268
Cut through all the tension,
with that one joke.

1:00:47.352 --> 1:00:51.147
She had made up for 45 minutes
of a stinker of a show.

1:00:53.399 --> 1:00:55.401
And after that, she could do no
wrong.

1:00:55.485 --> 1:00:58.696
And I kept on rocking,
and she kept on talking to me.

1:00:58.780 --> 1:01:03.034
And then the show
became something cooler than a show.

1:01:03.117 --> 1:01:04.535
It became like a conversation

1:01:04.619 --> 1:01:06.579
between a Black man
and a White trans woman

1:01:06.663 --> 1:01:08.456
and we started
getting to the bottom of shit.

1:01:08.539 --> 1:01:11.667
All of them questions that you think about
that you'd be afraid to ask,

1:01:11.751 --> 1:01:13.002
I was just asking them

1:01:13.086 --> 1:01:15.880
and she was answering them
and her answers were funny as shit.

1:01:15.963 --> 1:01:17.674
The crowd was falling out of their
chairs

1:01:17.757 --> 1:01:20.343
and at the end of the show,
I go, "Well, Daphne"-- I said

1:01:20.426 --> 1:01:21.427
"Well, that was fun."

1:01:21.511 --> 1:01:23.971
I go, "I love you to death,
but I have no fuckin' idea

1:01:24.055 --> 1:01:25.431
what you're talking about."

1:01:25.515 --> 1:01:27.475
The whole crow laughed

1:01:27.558 --> 1:01:29.143
except for Daphne.

1:01:29.227 --> 1:01:32.146
Man, she looks at me
like I'm not her friend anymore.

1:01:32.230 --> 1:01:35.733
Like I'm something bigger than me,
like I'm the whole world in a guy.

1:01:35.817 --> 1:01:39.195
Then she said, "I don't need you
to understand me."

1:01:39.278 --> 1:01:40.405
I said, "What?"

1:01:40.488 --> 1:01:42.907
She said, "I just need
you to believe..."

1:01:42.990 --> 1:01:46.828
Just like that she goes,
"...that I'm having a human experience."

1:01:47.620 --> 1:01:48.913
And when she said it

1:01:49.705 --> 1:01:51.666
the whole crowd kind of gasped.

1:01:53.042 --> 1:01:54.711
And I gave the <i>Fight Club </i>look.

1:01:57.004 --> 1:01:58.840
I said, "I believe you, bitch."

1:01:58.923 --> 1:02:00.174
[laughter]

1:02:01.259 --> 1:02:03.886
Because she didn't say anything
about pronouns.

1:02:03.970 --> 1:02:06.639
She didn't say anything
about me being in trouble.

1:02:06.723 --> 1:02:09.892
She said, "Just believe I'm a person
and I'm going through it."

1:02:09.976 --> 1:02:14.063
I know I believe you,
because it takes one to know one.

1:02:14.939 --> 1:02:16.941
[cheers and applause]

1:02:25.908 --> 1:02:28.661
Then I told the crowd "Good night."
And they started going crazy

1:02:28.745 --> 1:02:30.830
and before the applause
gets to it's crescendo

1:02:30.913 --> 1:02:33.750
I was saying, "Don't forget
my opening act, Daphne."

1:02:34.333 --> 1:02:35.710
And the crowd stood up.

1:02:36.294 --> 1:02:38.671
And I looked at her,
tears came out of her eyes

1:02:38.754 --> 1:02:40.756
she couldn't believe it was
happening.

1:02:40.840 --> 1:02:44.010
I couldn't believe it was happening
'cause her show stunk.

1:02:44.093 --> 1:02:45.303
[laughter]

1:02:47.472 --> 1:02:48.514
And it was a great night.

1:02:48.598 --> 1:02:50.683
And I remember, the late great Paul
Mooney was there

1:02:50.767 --> 1:02:52.810
bunch of flyers, comedy niggas was
there.

1:02:52.894 --> 1:02:54.770
[cheers]

1:02:54.854 --> 1:02:56.272
[applause]

1:02:57.315 --> 1:02:58.733
And we all went backstage

1:02:58.816 --> 1:03:00.735
and was just drinking
and talking shit and laughing

1:03:00.818 --> 1:03:03.696
and Daphne stole the room,
she had everyone cracking up.

1:03:03.779 --> 1:03:07.200
Spinning the yarn, telling us all these
crazy stories about shit, she'd be into.

1:03:07.825 --> 1:03:09.118
We all laughing real hard,

1:03:09.202 --> 1:03:10.745
and there she is telling us
and everyone is laughing.

1:03:10.828 --> 1:03:13.456
I'm looking around, I'm like,
"Oh my God, she is funny."

1:03:14.415 --> 1:03:16.250
I pulled her aside, I said,
"You're hilarious.

1:03:16.334 --> 1:03:18.628
I didn't know that
when you were onstage."

1:03:18.711 --> 1:03:19.796
[laughter]

1:03:21.380 --> 1:03:23.508
I said, "You're doing some things wrong
but I can help you."

1:03:23.591 --> 1:03:26.427
I said, "Anytime I'm in San Francisco
why don't you open the show for me

1:03:26.511 --> 1:03:28.095
and I'll just try
to give you some pointers

1:03:28.179 --> 1:03:29.597
and see if you can work
this thing out."

1:03:29.680 --> 1:03:31.641
She said, "Are you serious?"

1:03:31.724 --> 1:03:32.975
I was like, "Yeah."

1:03:33.059 --> 1:03:37.605
And she grabbed me real tight,
hugged me, squeezed me.

1:03:38.105 --> 1:03:41.442
And I pushed her off violently,
'cause I'm transphobic.

1:03:42.235 --> 1:03:44.153
I said "Boundaries, bitch!"

1:03:44.237 --> 1:03:45.905
[audience laughs]

1:03:52.870 --> 1:03:54.705
When Sticks and Stones came out...

1:03:56.207 --> 1:03:58.876
a lot of people in the trans community
were furious with me and

1:03:58.960 --> 1:04:00.920
apparently they dragged me on
Twitter.

1:04:01.003 --> 1:04:03.422
I don't give a fuck,
'cause Twitter is not a real place.

1:04:04.006 --> 1:04:05.466
[audience laughs]

1:04:05.550 --> 1:04:07.552
[cheers and applause]

1:04:13.516 --> 1:04:16.310
And the hardest thing for a person
to do

1:04:16.394 --> 1:04:18.020
is go against their tribe

1:04:18.104 --> 1:04:21.607
if they disagree with their tribe,
but Daphne did that for me.

1:04:22.316 --> 1:04:25.861
She wrote a tweet that was very beautiful
and what she said was

1:04:25.945 --> 1:04:27.655
and it is almost exactly what she
said.

1:04:28.155 --> 1:04:32.034
She said, "Punching down on someone,
requires you to think less of them

1:04:32.118 --> 1:04:34.245
and I know him, and he doesn't.

1:04:34.870 --> 1:04:37.957
He doesn't punch up,
he doesn't punch down

1:04:38.040 --> 1:04:43.045
he punches lines, and he is a master
at his craft." That's what she said.

1:04:43.129 --> 1:04:45.590
[audience cheers]

1:04:50.636 --> 1:04:54.098
Beautiful tweet, beautiful friend,
it took a lot of heart

1:04:54.181 --> 1:04:57.143
to defend me like that,
and when she did that

1:04:57.226 --> 1:05:01.689
the trans community
dragged that bitch all over Twitter.

1:05:03.149 --> 1:05:06.235
For days, they was going in on her,
and she was holding her own

1:05:06.319 --> 1:05:07.445
'cause she's funny.

1:05:07.987 --> 1:05:11.699
But six days after that wonderful night
I described to you

1:05:11.782 --> 1:05:15.119
my friend Daphne killed herself.

1:05:16.412 --> 1:05:20.207
Oh yeah, this is a true story,
my heart was broken.

1:05:20.917 --> 1:05:22.960
Yeah, it wasn't the jokes.

1:05:23.044 --> 1:05:24.253
I don't know if was them dragging

1:05:24.337 --> 1:05:25.504
or I don't know
what was going on in her life

1:05:25.588 --> 1:05:27.298
but I bet dragging her didn't help.

1:05:28.424 --> 1:05:30.968
I was very angry at them,
I was very angry at her.

1:05:31.802 --> 1:05:33.220
I felt like Daphne lied to me.

1:05:33.304 --> 1:05:35.473
She always said,
she identified as a woman.

1:05:35.556 --> 1:05:37.933
And then one day she goes up
to the roof of her building

1:05:38.017 --> 1:05:40.853
and jumps off and kills herself.

1:05:40.937 --> 1:05:42.229
Clearly...

1:05:42.980 --> 1:05:45.816
only a man
would do some gangster shit like that.

1:05:48.819 --> 1:05:49.987
Hear me out.

1:05:51.113 --> 1:05:53.407
As hard as it is to hear a joke like
that

1:05:53.491 --> 1:05:56.911
I'm telling you right now,
Daphne would have loved that joke.

1:05:56.994 --> 1:05:59.121
That is why she was my friend.

1:05:59.205 --> 1:06:01.248
[cheers and applause]

1:06:09.423 --> 1:06:11.175
I was reading her obituary

1:06:12.593 --> 1:06:15.846
and I found out,
she was survived by a daughter.

1:06:18.140 --> 1:06:20.935
And the moment I found that out,
and this is true

1:06:21.018 --> 1:06:23.938
Anderson Cooper from CNN texted me.

1:06:25.022 --> 1:06:26.399
And all he says, it's very nice,
he said,

1:06:26.482 --> 1:06:28.359
"I'm sorry to hear
about your friend."

1:06:28.442 --> 1:06:32.238
And I texted him right back.
"New phone, who this?"

1:06:32.321 --> 1:06:34.073
[laughter]

1:06:36.242 --> 1:06:37.451
He said, "It's Anderson Cooper."

1:06:37.535 --> 1:06:40.788
Oh, I said, "Anderson, look
I need to find her family."

1:06:40.871 --> 1:06:42.331
And he texted me right back

1:06:42.415 --> 1:06:44.959
with all the phone numbers
and all this information.

1:06:45.042 --> 1:06:47.461
I say this to say, if you ever want to
know about anything gay

1:06:48.004 --> 1:06:49.964
call Anderson Cooper from CNN.

1:06:50.548 --> 1:06:52.591
This nigga is faster than Google.

1:06:52.675 --> 1:06:54.593
[laughter]

1:06:58.013 --> 1:07:00.057
What I did is,
I got in touch with her family

1:07:00.141 --> 1:07:02.768
and I started a trust fund
for her daughter

1:07:02.852 --> 1:07:06.022
'cause I know that is all
she ever really cared about.

1:07:07.398 --> 1:07:09.942
[applause]

1:07:15.156 --> 1:07:17.116
And I don't know
what the trans community did for her

1:07:17.199 --> 1:07:18.951
but I don't care,
because I feel like

1:07:19.035 --> 1:07:21.829
she wasn't their tribe,
she was mine.

1:07:21.912 --> 1:07:24.040
She was a comedian in her soul.

1:07:24.123 --> 1:07:25.916
[applause]

1:07:28.669 --> 1:07:31.672
The daughter is very young,
but I hope to be alive

1:07:32.715 --> 1:07:34.008
when she turns 21

1:07:34.091 --> 1:07:36.927
'cause I'm going
to give her this money myself.

1:07:37.011 --> 1:07:38.304
And by then,

1:07:38.888 --> 1:07:41.640
by then, I'll be ready to have the
conversation

1:07:41.724 --> 1:07:44.101
that I'm not ready to have today.

1:07:44.185 --> 1:07:46.312
But I'll tell that little girl,
"Young lady,

1:07:47.104 --> 1:07:48.689
I knew your father...

1:07:48.773 --> 1:07:50.483
[audience laughs]

1:07:51.817 --> 1:07:53.611
...and he was a wonderful woman."

1:07:55.029 --> 1:07:57.490
[cheers]

1:07:58.449 --> 1:08:00.618
[applause]

1:08:05.247 --> 1:08:10.795
Empathy is not gay.
Empathy is not Black.

1:08:12.421 --> 1:08:17.510
Empathy is bi-sexual.
It must go both ways.

1:08:19.178 --> 1:08:21.472
It must go both ways.

1:08:21.555 --> 1:08:22.807
[applause]

1:08:23.766 --> 1:08:28.938
Remember, taking a man's livelihood
is akin to killing him.

1:08:29.563 --> 1:08:33.651
I'm begging you, please do not abort
DaBaby.

1:08:34.235 --> 1:08:35.569
[laughter]

1:08:38.739 --> 1:08:40.366
[applause]

1:08:43.911 --> 1:08:50.459
Kevin Hart dreamt his entire life of
hosting the Oscars

1:08:50.543 --> 1:08:54.338
and when he finally got the job they just
took it!

1:08:55.047 --> 1:08:56.090
It's not fair.

1:08:56.924 --> 1:08:59.510
They didn't kill him,
Kevin is a strong guy.

1:08:59.593 --> 1:09:02.680
But I'm sure
it broke old Clifford's heart.

1:09:06.475 --> 1:09:07.476
It's over.

1:09:08.477 --> 1:09:12.314
LBGTQ, L-M-N-O-P-Q-Y-Z,
it is over.

1:09:13.107 --> 1:09:15.359
I'm not telling another joke
about you

1:09:15.442 --> 1:09:19.029
until we are both sure,
that we are laughing together.

1:09:20.406 --> 1:09:23.409
I'm telling you this is done.
I'm done talking about it.

1:09:23.492 --> 1:09:27.663
All I ask from your community,
with all humility

1:09:27.746 --> 1:09:31.125
will you please stop

1:09:31.750 --> 1:09:33.878
punching down on my people?

1:09:33.961 --> 1:09:36.839
Thank you very much and good night.
