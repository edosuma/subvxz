02:45.088 --> 02:46.213
Okay, see you tomorrow.

05:13.963 --> 05:19.130
<i>From Independence Mall,
this is news radio, KYW Philadelphia ten...</i>

05:40.755 --> 05:44.172
<i>Absolute chaotic scene
behind me right now at this intersection,</i>

05:44.255 --> 05:45.505
<i>where just earlier this evening</i>

05:45.880 --> 05:48.838
<i>a bus driver collided
with several oncoming vehicles,</i>

05:48.922 --> 05:51.505
<i>- one of them a cement mixer.</i>
<i>- </i>All right, here we go.

05:51.588 --> 05:53.797
<i>A huge mess on the scene here right now.</i>

05:53.880 --> 05:57.338
<i>We're still not clear
as to what exactly happened here,</i>

05:57.422 --> 06:01.380
<i>whether the driver passed out
while operating the vehicle</i>

06:01.463 --> 06:03.172
<i>or simply died at the wheel.</i>

06:04.005 --> 06:06.172
<i>We don't have a cause of death
at this point,</i>

06:06.255 --> 06:08.630
<i>but some of our medical experts
are talking about the fact</i>

06:08.713 --> 06:10.172
<i>that it could've been a heart attack</i>

06:10.255 --> 06:11.797
<i>- or a stroke.</i>
- Mmm, perfect pancake!

06:11.880 --> 06:14.963
<i>We don't have a name on the driver,
no information at all.</i>

06:15.047 --> 06:16.807
<i>Police have not released that
at this point.</i>

06:16.838 --> 06:19.088
<i>- Next of kin still being notified.</i>

06:19.172 --> 06:21.047
<i>But no other casualties reported,</i>

06:21.130 --> 06:22.755
<i>- which is a minor miracle.</i>
- Fuck.

06:22.838 --> 06:25.213
<i>Speaking with some of the officers
here on the scene...</i>

06:25.297 --> 06:26.297
Fuck.

06:27.338 --> 06:28.630
Shit.

06:29.547 --> 06:32.047
- Shit.
<i>- There could have been more fatalities</i>

06:32.130 --> 06:35.005
<i>is what these officers are saying to me.
Uh, we...</i>

06:35.088 --> 06:37.255
You burned 'em again,
didn't you?

06:37.338 --> 06:39.380
No! No, no, nothing's burnt.

06:41.922 --> 06:43.088
Ah, come on.

06:48.505 --> 06:49.838
Yes, I'll be right out.

06:52.297 --> 06:53.797
Ah, Jesus.

06:56.963 --> 06:58.422
Hey, hey, baby.

07:00.172 --> 07:01.255
- Hmm.
- Hey.

07:02.838 --> 07:03.838
Was that Maddox?

07:03.880 --> 07:05.588
Yeah. I gotta go soon.

07:06.588 --> 07:08.172
I feel like a piñata.

07:08.255 --> 07:09.713
How's my baby girl?

07:09.797 --> 07:11.255
Kicking up a storm.

07:11.838 --> 07:13.547
Feels like she got your big feet.

07:13.797 --> 07:15.797
Maybe I'll pick up some Doc Martens
on the way out.

07:17.213 --> 07:18.213
Come on up.

07:21.255 --> 07:22.255
- Here.
- Ah.

07:23.047 --> 07:25.380
Had that weird pregnancy dream again.

07:25.463 --> 07:26.463
Oh, no.

07:28.130 --> 07:31.130
We were still on the beach,
but a little different this time.

07:31.547 --> 07:34.213
I couldn't see you,
but I knew you were with me,

07:34.297 --> 07:37.838
like how sometimes you just know
things like that in a dream.

07:37.922 --> 07:40.005
Honey, you seen my other shoe?

07:40.422 --> 07:41.880
Your shoes are under the bed.

07:42.172 --> 07:43.338
Go on, I'm listening.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.922
So we were standing
in the shallow water,

07:46.005 --> 07:49.005
and we were playing that game
like you play as a kid.

07:49.922 --> 07:52.047
When the tide would go back out

07:52.130 --> 07:53.922
you'd twist a little and...

07:54.838 --> 07:57.505
and sink lower
into the wet sand.

07:58.630 --> 08:00.588
I just kept sinking down and down,

08:00.672 --> 08:03.547
and no matter how hard I tried,
I couldn't get up.

08:06.963 --> 08:08.380
- Tommy?
- What?

08:10.338 --> 08:12.213
You make the worst pancakes.

08:15.130 --> 08:16.338
I've gotta go, okay?

08:17.922 --> 08:19.713
I love you, Tommy Lockhart.

08:19.922 --> 08:20.922
I love you more.

08:21.172 --> 08:23.797
But these graveyard shifts are the worst.

08:24.588 --> 08:26.797
I'm tired of having breakfast for dinner.

08:26.880 --> 08:29.380
And they're almost over, okay?

08:29.463 --> 08:31.963
- Detective's around the corner.
- Mm-hmm.

08:32.297 --> 08:34.422
But I'll bring you something back
to make up for it.

08:34.505 --> 08:36.922
Oh, promises promises.

08:38.338 --> 08:39.755
So, I pinky swear.

08:41.547 --> 08:44.005
- I look forward to being proven wrong.
- Deal.

08:46.130 --> 08:49.755
<i>With the shot clock winding
down, Barkley coming up short once again.</i>

08:49.838 --> 08:52.797
<i>Another good night of rebounding
for Charles, but not enough buckets.</i>

08:52.880 --> 08:53.963
Come on, Barkley.

08:56.297 --> 08:57.838
Shit.

08:59.213 --> 09:00.213
About time.

09:00.797 --> 09:01.672
Yeah.

09:01.755 --> 09:03.922
<i>Now the Sixers playoff...</i>

09:04.338 --> 09:06.922
Hey, come on, I wanna see how it ends.

09:07.005 --> 09:10.213
Huh, Winston Maddox, you got some amount
of money riding on this tonight?

09:10.297 --> 09:11.130
Shit.

09:11.213 --> 09:12.380
- Yeah?
- Don't do it.

09:15.797 --> 09:17.630
<i>And that's all she wrote, folks.</i>

09:17.713 --> 09:21.463
<i>Philadelphia loses a heartbreaker
to Atlanta, 103 to 101.</i>

09:22.338 --> 09:23.463
Well, there you go.

09:24.547 --> 09:25.547
Thanks for that.

09:25.588 --> 09:26.588
How much?

09:33.630 --> 09:36.672
Thought most folks think about
moving out of white trash neighborhoods.

09:36.755 --> 09:38.755
Yeah, yeah. Trust me, I'm working on it.

09:39.588 --> 09:42.880
You know, the first perp that ever took
a swing at me was two blocks that way.

09:42.963 --> 09:44.963
Oh, yeah. You never mentioned it.

09:46.047 --> 09:49.255
Yeah, you're all jokes now, but you've got
a pregnant wife back there, pal.

09:49.338 --> 09:50.547
Trust me, I know.

09:50.630 --> 09:53.505
Back pain,
feet the size of a kitchen sink.

09:53.588 --> 09:55.338
She's cranky, she's hungry...

09:55.422 --> 09:56.588
Yeah, I remember those days.

09:56.672 --> 09:59.255
But hey, maybe you can find the guy
that knocked her up

09:59.338 --> 10:01.422
- and make him deal with it.
- Fuck you.

10:02.797 --> 10:03.922
All right, what do we got?

10:04.005 --> 10:06.255
We've got a big pile-up downtown.

10:06.338 --> 10:07.338
The city bus?

10:07.713 --> 10:11.130
That's bridge traffic.
That's gonna be, I don't know, 30 minutes?

10:11.505 --> 10:13.213
Ten spot says I'll get us there in 20.

10:14.380 --> 10:15.380
I'll take that.

10:47.505 --> 10:49.005
Oh, 22 minutes. You owe me ten.

10:49.588 --> 10:50.797
Shit.

10:50.880 --> 10:51.963
I want a recount.

10:57.755 --> 10:59.130
Oh, fuck. Holt's here.

10:59.755 --> 11:02.213
You know, when he, uh,
dry cleans his ties, it's full starch.

11:02.297 --> 11:03.130
What a dick.

11:03.213 --> 11:06.047
- Hey, that's my wife's brother.
- Tell me he's not a dick.

11:07.130 --> 11:10.380
- Maintain a safe distance at all times.
- Keep it clear over there!

11:11.380 --> 11:13.880
This whole thing is nuts.
You should've seen the bus driver.

11:13.963 --> 11:16.005
- You would have loved it.
- Yeah? Why?

11:16.088 --> 11:17.755
Oh, trust me, she's a doozy.

11:19.005 --> 11:20.088
No, man, don't do it.

11:21.088 --> 11:24.088
- Don't do it. You know how Holt gets.
- I'll just take a peek.

11:26.130 --> 11:28.963
Is a normal, boring shift too much to ask?

11:43.547 --> 11:44.963
Blood's not from her injury.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.463
You got some gloves?

11:47.547 --> 11:48.922
You got a detective badge?

11:50.463 --> 11:51.630
I'll bum you a smoke.

11:57.380 --> 11:59.047
Oh, God, do you smell that?

12:00.047 --> 12:01.630
Severe hemorrhage...

12:03.380 --> 12:05.047
then hit hard on the steering wheel.

12:05.130 --> 12:06.588
Yeah, but why the hemorrhage?

12:13.088 --> 12:14.588
What the fuck?

12:14.922 --> 12:15.922
Empty.

12:17.963 --> 12:19.588
Whoa, don't touch that.

12:24.380 --> 12:25.380
Pieces of brain.

12:25.463 --> 12:26.922
Goddamn.

12:27.838 --> 12:29.630
Who invited you two to the party?

12:30.005 --> 12:33.755
Officers, I'm gonna need you to dust
all this broken glass for fingerprints.

12:36.172 --> 12:37.505
I'm just fucking with you.

12:37.880 --> 12:39.255
Yeah.

12:41.380 --> 12:43.297
So how's my sis? She about to explode?

12:43.880 --> 12:45.880
Yeah, any day. Uh, you know, these are...

12:45.963 --> 12:47.130
Chunks of brain.

12:47.547 --> 12:49.505
Yep, we solved that one, Crockett.

12:58.588 --> 12:59.755
Yeah? What about that?

13:01.547 --> 13:02.880
Uh, birthmark.

13:02.963 --> 13:04.047
Maybe a rash.

13:05.922 --> 13:07.380
Looks like a puncture wound.

13:08.463 --> 13:09.588
Sure, sharp glass.

13:10.588 --> 13:12.797
Boys across town
just caught two more bodies.

13:13.130 --> 13:15.088
Bled out: ears, nose, mouth.

13:15.380 --> 13:17.505
They said both had some kind of mark
on their neck.

13:19.005 --> 13:20.338
A whole lot of birthmarks.

13:20.880 --> 13:23.148
Pump your brakes, all right?
You've had your five minutes.

13:23.172 --> 13:24.172
Come on.

13:28.630 --> 13:29.630
Nah.

13:29.963 --> 13:31.047
We're not gonna go.

13:31.505 --> 13:33.422
We're gonna stay here. We'll relax.

13:34.255 --> 13:35.338
Find our center.

13:37.130 --> 13:38.463
Practice our breathing.

13:38.547 --> 13:41.922
Plenty of people can stand behind tape,
yell at reporters. Come on.

13:42.088 --> 13:43.088
I'll drive!

13:43.255 --> 13:44.255
Come on.

14:05.005 --> 14:06.005
Shit.

14:07.463 --> 14:08.963
You guys going on tour?

14:10.630 --> 14:13.213
Hey, just trying to learn
from the best, Detective.

14:13.588 --> 14:14.588
Okay.

14:15.297 --> 14:17.505
- Go ahead.
- Well, there was just blood everywhere.

14:28.297 --> 14:29.797
But no brains on this one.

14:39.172 --> 14:40.713
Oh! There we go.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.630
Ah, Jesus!

14:43.755 --> 14:46.338
No kind of hemorrhage I know of
includes brain disintegration.

14:46.422 --> 14:49.797
It could be a drug thing,
you know, puncture wounds.

14:50.338 --> 14:53.130
- What we need to do is run toxicology.
- What do you mean, "we"?

14:53.213 --> 14:55.422
Look, you were right
about the bus driver, good call,

14:55.505 --> 14:58.213
but I'm running point on this.
You do your job, I'll do mine.

14:58.297 --> 15:00.755
- Come on, give me a bone here.
- Detective! Detective Holt!

15:00.838 --> 15:03.172
Look, look, look,
I respect the hustle, I do,

15:03.255 --> 15:04.255
- but...
- Detective!

15:04.755 --> 15:08.588
Look, even though nobody said the word
"serial killer" out loud yet,

15:08.672 --> 15:10.672
that time's coming, and when it does...

15:11.422 --> 15:13.630
this is my first big one, okay.

15:14.088 --> 15:15.172
This could make me.

15:15.755 --> 15:17.880
I need to be able
to wrap my head around it on my own.

15:17.963 --> 15:20.588
Just give me a little breathing room,
all right?

15:21.338 --> 15:22.963
- All right.
- Detective!

15:23.047 --> 15:25.755
Detective, what can you tell us
about the other two victims?

15:25.838 --> 15:28.088
Sorry, everybody,
no official statement yet.

15:28.172 --> 15:30.255
You know the drill,
we're still collecting evidence.

15:30.338 --> 15:32.172
Is there a connection
to the other deaths?

15:32.255 --> 15:34.815
- What'd I tell you? He's a dick.
- I can't answer that question,

15:34.880 --> 15:37.588
and even if I could,
I wouldn't do it right here, okay?

15:53.755 --> 15:55.555
Eh, you're just making
more work for yourself,

15:55.588 --> 15:58.130
and more importantly, more work for me.

15:58.213 --> 16:00.088
You don't want to see
where this goes? Huh?

16:01.172 --> 16:04.338
Shit. I wanna go kick bums
out of the park like we're supposed to.

16:04.422 --> 16:07.088
Yeah, well, bums will still be there
when we're done, bud.

16:07.755 --> 16:09.130
Hey, you Dr. Hanson?

16:09.213 --> 16:10.047
Yeah.

16:10.130 --> 16:13.213
Yeah, three bodies came in tonight,
all of them had brain hemorrhaging,

16:13.297 --> 16:14.963
marks in the back of their neck.

16:15.047 --> 16:15.880
And who are you?

16:15.963 --> 16:18.338
Oh, I'm, uh, Officer Lockhart.
This is Officer Maddox.

16:18.422 --> 16:20.922
Okay. Well, there's been a hold
placed on that report

16:21.005 --> 16:22.797
by detective Brian Holt.

16:23.005 --> 16:23.838
Surprise.

16:23.922 --> 16:26.755
- Yeah, he's family, sir. I'm sure...
- I said a hold, Officer.

16:26.838 --> 16:30.088
Can't break protocol every time
some idiot's stuck with a needle.

16:31.422 --> 16:32.588
So it was a puncture wound.

16:37.630 --> 16:38.713
Injection sites.

16:39.297 --> 16:41.172
And deep enough to impact the vertebrate.

16:41.547 --> 16:44.922
So, some kind of poison,
like blowfish toxin?

16:45.005 --> 16:47.463
No. An unstable isotope.

16:48.505 --> 16:49.505
Some shit.

16:49.672 --> 16:51.630
Lab techs all have hard-ons for it.

16:52.005 --> 16:53.005
Why?

16:53.380 --> 16:55.047
Because we have no idea what it is.

16:56.838 --> 16:58.297
No one's ever seen it before.

16:58.922 --> 17:00.338
Now, if you'll excuse me...

17:01.213 --> 17:02.963
I've got other dead people waitin'.

17:06.463 --> 17:08.130
All right, we need to think.

17:11.088 --> 17:12.088
Hoagies.

17:12.463 --> 17:13.463
Last night.

17:13.797 --> 17:15.088
- Pizza.
- Too greasy.

17:15.922 --> 17:17.213
Oriental it is.

17:17.297 --> 17:19.672
You know, I think
you're supposed to say "Asian" now.

17:19.755 --> 17:22.505
Whatever, as long as they keep
that sweet and sour pork coming,

17:22.588 --> 17:24.463
I'll call 'em whatever they want. Shit.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.255
Listen, all I'm saying is
we got people getting injected

17:29.338 --> 17:32.505
with a fucking isotope of all things,
and nobody can tell us shit.

17:32.588 --> 17:35.388
And the times of death are minutes apart,
the bodies are miles apart...

17:35.422 --> 17:36.255
How does that work?

17:36.338 --> 17:38.880
I'll take "crazy shit happens"
for 200, Alex.

17:38.963 --> 17:41.689
We had three random victims
with the brains melted out of their faces.

17:41.713 --> 17:43.047
That means nothing to you?

17:43.338 --> 17:45.755
I'll admit, it's weird, but... shit.

17:46.505 --> 17:49.588
Remember them two yuppies washed up
on the shore of the lake couple years ago?

17:49.672 --> 17:52.547
Buck naked, bruised up.
Everybody thought it was a mob hit.

17:52.630 --> 17:55.422
Turns out it was just two gays,
liked it rough,

17:55.505 --> 17:57.981
having a bit too much to drink
before they went skinny dipping.

17:58.005 --> 17:59.685
But you heard
what the coroner said, right?

17:59.713 --> 18:02.088
Man, your energy's
all over the place, man.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.213
Let the game come to you.

18:05.297 --> 18:06.797
Says the grand master.

18:07.213 --> 18:08.338
Everything else aside,

18:08.963 --> 18:10.338
I say this from experience,

18:11.047 --> 18:12.630
once that kiddo arrives...

18:13.713 --> 18:15.047
that'll be the whole boat.

18:16.213 --> 18:19.088
You won't have time
to think about shit this much. It'll be...

18:19.172 --> 18:20.922
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- Background noise.

18:21.380 --> 18:23.255
- I hope.
- Give me that ten bucks.

18:23.338 --> 18:24.338
Mmm.

18:24.797 --> 18:26.380
Say what now?

18:26.463 --> 18:29.103
It's not my fault you've got
a gambling problem. Give me the money.

18:29.838 --> 18:30.963
Thank you. Hold that.

18:31.672 --> 18:33.672
Hey, I'll strike you a deal here.

18:33.755 --> 18:35.588
Uh, give me that... that for ten?

18:37.963 --> 18:38.963
Yeah.

18:42.755 --> 18:43.755
Thank you.

18:44.297 --> 18:45.505
Gonna make a girl happy.

18:46.047 --> 18:47.047
Appreciate it.

18:51.338 --> 18:52.422
Oh.

18:52.505 --> 18:54.213
Oh, come on, I was gonna eat that.

18:54.463 --> 18:55.463
You're kidding me.

18:55.713 --> 18:56.713
Put it on my tab.

18:57.047 --> 18:58.047
What tab?

18:58.630 --> 19:02.588
<i>Units be advised 314
at Hydra on 22nd and Armory,</i>

19:02.755 --> 19:04.588
<i>female, late teens, assaulted,</i>

19:04.672 --> 19:05.922
<i>blunt force to the neck.</i>

19:07.505 --> 19:09.297
Uh, dispatch, this is car 39.

19:09.380 --> 19:11.922
Could you get the officer at Hydra
and get me on the radio?

19:15.297 --> 19:18.672
- <i>Go for it, Officer Palmer.</i>
- Evening. Officer Lockhart here.

19:18.755 --> 19:21.130
You mind looking at the back
of your victim's neck?

19:22.672 --> 19:23.672
<i>All right.</i>

19:24.297 --> 19:25.297
See anything?

19:27.422 --> 19:30.047
<i>Yeah, three bumps.
Little circles.</i>

19:31.380 --> 19:32.380
What about the blood?

19:32.463 --> 19:33.588
Anything weird?

19:34.755 --> 19:36.588
<i>What blood? She's still alive.</i>

19:36.963 --> 19:39.005
All right, we're on our way.

20:14.838 --> 20:17.518
Girl says she was stabbed
with some kind of metal tool or some shit.

20:17.547 --> 20:18.380
Metal tool?

20:18.463 --> 20:20.588
Last week we had a guy come in
from this place,

20:20.672 --> 20:22.838
egg beater stuck up his ass,
I shit you not.

20:23.088 --> 20:25.255
I was too impressed to be disgusted.

20:34.338 --> 20:35.547
All right, let's see it.

20:41.338 --> 20:43.297
All right, tell me what happened.

20:45.338 --> 20:46.463
She had on a blue hoodie.

20:47.213 --> 20:48.213
"She"?

20:48.505 --> 20:50.005
Honey, you sure she's a "she"?

20:51.380 --> 20:52.422
Yes, yeah.

20:53.047 --> 20:54.672
- Yes.
- What'd she look like?

20:56.047 --> 20:57.797
Like she was in the wrong neighborhood.

21:00.380 --> 21:01.380
Black.

21:02.713 --> 21:04.005
All right, anything else?

21:06.255 --> 21:07.380
Yeah, um...

21:07.963 --> 21:10.505
Her hand was all messed up.
It was covered in dried blood.

21:11.172 --> 21:12.172
Okay, which hand?

21:12.963 --> 21:13.963
I...

21:15.047 --> 21:16.922
Okay, it's okay. Which hand? Right here.

21:17.005 --> 21:18.005
Um...

21:18.880 --> 21:20.130
- Her left. Left.
- Left hand.

21:20.213 --> 21:21.523
- Yeah.
- Okay, you're doing great.

21:21.547 --> 21:24.588
Tom, I just got off with the coroner.
What the hell?

21:24.672 --> 21:26.547
Yeah, I was just about to get you
on the radio.

21:26.630 --> 21:28.172
Just please step outside.

21:28.880 --> 21:31.273
Listen, she's got that shit
in her bloodstream. We need to...

21:31.297 --> 21:32.463
Step aside.

21:32.547 --> 21:33.755
What do you mean, "shit"?

21:34.130 --> 21:35.570
Don't even listen to him. It's fine.

21:36.005 --> 21:37.005
Okay.

21:37.672 --> 21:39.588
From the top. What happened?

21:40.255 --> 21:41.695
Come on, I just told him everything.

21:41.755 --> 21:44.172
He's a little deaf. I want you to tell me.

21:46.422 --> 21:47.963
I was just dancing, okay,

21:48.047 --> 21:50.547
and out of nowhere,
this crazy chick tackles me to the ground.

21:50.630 --> 21:51.963
She was real strong, too.

21:52.172 --> 21:54.630
These guys, they...
they pulled her off me, but...

21:55.505 --> 21:58.505
she... she poked my neck with something.

22:00.880 --> 22:01.880
Miss?

22:03.380 --> 22:04.755
Jesus. Hey, hey, hey!

22:04.838 --> 22:05.880
I need some help here!

22:05.963 --> 22:06.797
Whoa, whoa!

22:06.880 --> 22:07.713
I need an EMT!

22:07.797 --> 22:09.630
We need an EMT now! Hey! Now, now, now!

22:09.713 --> 22:12.047
Get a medic up here! Get a medic up here!
Hey, hey, hey!

22:13.672 --> 22:16.172
<i>Stand by for a single live BOLO.</i>

22:16.713 --> 22:18.172
<i>Suspect is a black female,</i>

22:18.255 --> 22:20.380
<i>last seen at Hydra on Arch Street.</i>

22:20.463 --> 22:21.963
<i>Five foot six, twenties,</i>

22:22.172 --> 22:23.672
<i>dried blood on her left hand,</i>

22:23.755 --> 22:25.672
<i>wearing a blue-hooded sweatshirt.</i>

23:12.963 --> 23:13.963
Freeze!

23:14.338 --> 23:15.458
Put your hands on your head!

23:30.005 --> 23:31.088
All units be advised:

23:32.088 --> 23:34.380
suspect last seen on foot
at Chestnut and University.

23:35.005 --> 23:37.338
<i>Repeat, Chestnut and University.</i>

23:42.755 --> 23:44.338
This is our chance at detective.

23:45.547 --> 23:47.422
Don't tell me
you're not thinking about it.

23:47.755 --> 23:49.838
I'm thinking I got
the wrong skin tone for that.

23:49.922 --> 23:52.297
But you got that sparkling personality.

23:52.880 --> 23:53.880
Shit.

23:57.297 --> 23:58.963
Hey, move it!

24:00.713 --> 24:01.630
Get out of the way.

24:01.713 --> 24:03.463
Move along, people.

24:07.755 --> 24:10.255
- Mm-mm-mm.
- Hey. Right there.

24:12.672 --> 24:14.297
- Right there.
- Whoa, look, man.

24:18.130 --> 24:20.856
You about to draw down on Old Saint Nick.
You almost killed Christmas.

24:20.880 --> 24:22.130
Whoa!

24:22.963 --> 24:24.630
- Hey!
- Holy shit.

24:30.005 --> 24:31.380
Whoa!

24:31.463 --> 24:33.755
What are you doing, man?

24:34.213 --> 24:35.297
Come on!

24:35.380 --> 24:36.380
Goddamn.

24:37.588 --> 24:38.838
Come on.

24:39.963 --> 24:41.255
Ah!

24:41.338 --> 24:44.088
Suspect heading west across Liberty!

24:46.172 --> 24:50.463
I repeat, suspect heading west
across Liberty!

24:51.047 --> 24:53.463
If you've got a badge on your chest
and a gun on your hip,

24:53.547 --> 24:55.630
I want you at that position now.

25:01.463 --> 25:03.047
- Whoa, whoa!
- Goddamn!

25:03.547 --> 25:05.172
No, no, no!

25:05.255 --> 25:06.630
Goddamn! Goddamn!

25:06.713 --> 25:07.713
- Goddamn!

25:09.005 --> 25:10.172
Whoa!

25:10.505 --> 25:11.797
I got kids, man.

25:13.588 --> 25:14.922
Truck! Truck!

25:16.963 --> 25:18.047
Whoa!

25:22.422 --> 25:23.797
Go around! Go around!

25:24.922 --> 25:26.922
Police! Move! Go! Get out of the way!

25:31.338 --> 25:32.422
Move!

25:32.672 --> 25:34.505
Out of the way! Go! Move!

25:43.088 --> 25:45.130
- Lock, she went this way!
- Hey!

25:46.755 --> 25:47.755
Move!

25:54.047 --> 25:56.338
I got this! I got this!
Go around! Go around!

26:16.797 --> 26:18.463
I gotta cut back to a pack a day.

26:20.713 --> 26:21.713
What do you got?

26:26.213 --> 26:27.255
I got eyes on her!

26:39.130 --> 26:40.130
All right.

26:40.297 --> 26:41.963
Meet me at Girard subway station.

26:42.255 --> 26:43.297
Block all the exits.

26:43.797 --> 26:45.630
<i>What the fuck
are you talking about?</i>

26:47.005 --> 26:48.380
I'm flushing her out.

26:48.463 --> 26:49.463
Shit!

26:58.838 --> 27:00.380
You two, on the door!

27:00.630 --> 27:01.963
No one in and no one out!

27:02.047 --> 27:03.255
You two, come with me.

27:08.797 --> 27:09.797
Out of the way!

27:11.130 --> 27:13.172
Philly PD, get the fuck out of here!

27:17.713 --> 27:19.297
What the hell?

27:33.963 --> 27:34.963
Come on.

27:39.088 --> 27:42.005
<i>Officer Lockhart,
I've got Rosewood General on the line.</i>

27:42.088 --> 27:43.588
<i>Your wife's going into labor.</i>

27:43.672 --> 27:45.088
<i>She's being taken there now.</i>

27:45.505 --> 27:47.172
<i>Officer Lockhart, please respond.</i>

27:48.422 --> 27:49.838
You two, stay on this level.

28:27.547 --> 28:28.547
Lock?

28:30.047 --> 28:31.047
I got her.

28:38.255 --> 28:39.755
I'm a police officer.

28:41.338 --> 28:42.797
We've got the exits sealed.

28:44.130 --> 28:45.463
Why don't you come on out?

28:46.672 --> 28:47.755
Put your hands up.

29:03.713 --> 29:04.547
Lock!

29:04.630 --> 29:06.463
Hey! Hey!

29:13.547 --> 29:14.630
Maddox!

29:21.130 --> 29:22.547
Maddox! Maddox!

29:22.630 --> 29:23.922
Hey, what happened?

29:24.297 --> 29:25.922
Got the wind knocked out of me.

29:26.630 --> 29:28.005
Go. Go!

29:28.088 --> 29:29.088
Lock!

29:31.422 --> 29:33.922
Fuck! I think she broke my leg.

29:34.255 --> 29:35.588
Goddammit.

29:37.338 --> 29:39.422
Officer down. Officer down.

29:39.672 --> 29:42.047
I need an ambulance
at the Girard Street subway.

29:46.255 --> 29:47.838
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

29:47.922 --> 29:50.130
Stay right there.
Stay right fucking there!

29:51.463 --> 29:52.505
Put your hands up.

29:52.838 --> 29:53.672
Now!

29:53.755 --> 29:55.005
Put your hands up.

29:57.422 --> 29:58.630
Get on the ground.

29:59.297 --> 30:00.672
Get on the ground. Hey, hey!

30:01.047 --> 30:03.172
You fucking deaf?
I said get on the ground.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.172
Hello, Thomas.

30:08.547 --> 30:09.963
This is where it happens.

30:11.213 --> 30:12.213
What?

30:14.213 --> 30:15.213
What'd you say?

30:16.797 --> 30:18.672
Congratulations on your daughter.

30:20.713 --> 30:21.797
Shut the fuck up.

30:22.713 --> 30:24.047
I said get on the ground!

30:27.797 --> 30:29.130
I want you to know...

30:31.213 --> 30:33.172
I'm sorry about your partner.

30:37.297 --> 30:38.463
I never meant to...

30:38.922 --> 30:40.880
Fuckin' stop talking.

31:12.172 --> 31:13.297
I'll see you soon.

31:20.213 --> 31:22.130
No! No!

32:14.672 --> 32:16.005
Step back, guys.

32:29.213 --> 32:31.713
Whoa, pal!
Hey, what are you still doing here?

32:33.130 --> 32:34.130
Did nobody tell you?

32:46.047 --> 32:47.047
Excuse me.

32:48.255 --> 32:49.255
Officer Lockhart?

32:49.297 --> 32:51.130
Yes, sir. Uh, where's the maternity ward?

32:51.213 --> 32:54.130
Uh, next building, down the hallway,
elevator to the third floor.

32:54.213 --> 32:56.653
I know it's not the best time,
but I need to check a few boxes

32:56.713 --> 32:57.880
while it's still fresh.

32:57.963 --> 32:59.005
Lockhart. Lockhart!

33:03.963 --> 33:05.797
Okay, so far, she's a nobody,

33:05.880 --> 33:08.297
no ID, no fingerprint matches, nothing.

33:08.380 --> 33:11.755
All she had on her were these keys.
We have no idea what they go to.

33:11.838 --> 33:13.558
We're drawing a blank.
Mean anything to you?

33:13.588 --> 33:15.463
- No.
- I'll need to see your revolver.

33:15.547 --> 33:16.630
- What?
- Your revolver!

33:17.922 --> 33:18.922
Here.

33:19.922 --> 33:20.922
Jeanette Lockhart?

33:21.047 --> 33:23.967
- Lockhart. Just give me one moment.
- You didn't fire your weapon at all?

33:24.588 --> 33:26.797
- No.
- Well, somebody did.

33:28.255 --> 33:30.297
<i>They pulled a bullet
from our girl's wrist...</i>

33:30.713 --> 33:32.338
and it matches a service revolver.

33:32.422 --> 33:35.255
- What are you talking about?
- No one else reported a shot fired.

33:35.963 --> 33:37.422
We can't make heads or tails.

33:37.963 --> 33:38.963
So...

33:39.297 --> 33:41.547
what happened down there, son,
in the subway station?

33:42.630 --> 33:43.963
Are you Jeanette's husband?

33:44.047 --> 33:46.088
Yes, yes. Hi, I'm... I'm Tom...
Tom Lockhart.

33:46.172 --> 33:48.005
There's been a complication.

33:48.547 --> 33:49.713
Placental abruption.

33:49.797 --> 33:50.713
What?

33:50.797 --> 33:51.797
She's hemorrhaging.

33:52.213 --> 33:54.297
But so far,
the baby appears to be safe.

33:56.713 --> 33:59.213
Push!

34:00.505 --> 34:01.797
Keep going! Keep going!

34:03.963 --> 34:05.172
Come on, Jeanie!

34:06.505 --> 34:08.088
Hey, I'm right here.

34:08.463 --> 34:10.547
I'm right here. I'm right here, baby.

34:10.880 --> 34:11.880
You're doing great.

34:11.922 --> 34:13.630
It's okay. Yeah.

34:13.713 --> 34:16.088
It's okay. Look, I got you something.

34:16.172 --> 34:18.630
I got you something good.
Yeah, I got you a bracelet.

34:18.713 --> 34:21.672
We're gonna push right through this.
We're gonna push right through this.

34:22.922 --> 34:26.047
- Okay. Come on, Jeanie, one more push.
- You're almost there, Mrs. Lockhart.

34:26.130 --> 34:27.047
Come on.

34:27.130 --> 34:29.422
The next one, big push, okay, Jeanie?
Jeanie?

34:29.505 --> 34:31.172
- Honey, come on.
- Jeanie?

34:31.713 --> 34:34.130
- What are her vitals?
- Baby? Honey?!

34:35.713 --> 34:37.505
- Get out of the room!
- Honey, honey!

34:37.588 --> 34:38.422
Hey!

34:38.505 --> 34:39.505
I got CPR!

35:27.588 --> 35:28.588
It's okay.

35:28.922 --> 35:31.047
It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.

36:35.422 --> 36:37.963
<i>I'm here on location in Center City</i>

36:38.047 --> 36:41.213
<i>on the nine-year anniversary
of the Market Street murders.</i>

36:41.297 --> 36:44.213
<i>As you can see,
protesters have gathered here once again.</i>

36:44.297 --> 36:46.130
<i>They're calling for a new investigation</i>

36:46.213 --> 36:50.547
<i>into the death of a still unidentified
African-American suspect.</i>

36:50.630 --> 36:54.130
<i>Those gathered here believe
the Philadelphia police are to blame.</i>

36:54.755 --> 36:56.463
<i>Black so-called perpetrator.</i>

36:56.755 --> 36:58.047
<i>We got a white cop,</i>

36:58.130 --> 37:00.213
<i>and based on his own admission,</i>

37:00.297 --> 37:01.630
<i>the woman was unarmed.</i>

37:02.172 --> 37:04.088
<i>Yet, he could not bring her in</i>

37:04.172 --> 37:06.130
<i>without throwing her in front of a train?</i>

37:06.213 --> 37:08.713
<i>They never identified the woman's body,</i>

37:08.797 --> 37:12.172
<i>and they never released a motive
for the homicide.</i>

37:12.255 --> 37:15.630
<i>And the icing on the cake
is the man got a promotion.</i>

37:15.713 --> 37:16.838
<i>A promotion?</i>

37:16.922 --> 37:18.797
<i>But Mayor Ed Rendell disagrees.</i>

37:19.380 --> 37:22.380
<i>Whereas there's an unfortunate
divide in our community today,</i>

37:22.463 --> 37:24.922
<i>we also have to remember the victims
and their families.</i>

37:25.505 --> 37:27.130
<i>Because there are no easy answers here,</i>

37:27.213 --> 37:29.963
<i>just as there weren't
on that night nine years ago.</i>

37:30.047 --> 37:31.963
- Daddy?
<i>- In terms of the traffic...</i>

37:32.047 --> 37:32.880
Yeah?

37:32.963 --> 37:33.963
What's that, baby?

37:34.547 --> 37:36.005
Your breakfast is melting.

37:38.755 --> 37:41.797
I thought we agreed
on no more ice cream for breakfast.

37:43.547 --> 37:44.838
Even on birthdays?

37:49.297 --> 37:52.380
You got me, honey. Why don't you put mine
in the fridge? Uh...

37:53.088 --> 37:54.255
I'm gonna be right out.

37:59.547 --> 38:02.213
Happy birthday, kiddo.

38:05.922 --> 38:06.922
Which hand?

38:07.713 --> 38:10.005
- That one!
- I don't know. Are you sure?

38:10.088 --> 38:11.088
Yeah.

38:15.797 --> 38:16.797
Put it on.

38:19.172 --> 38:20.963
Wow, we got so many places here.

38:21.047 --> 38:23.088
We've got this one, we've got that one.

38:23.172 --> 38:24.338
There we go.

38:27.672 --> 38:29.838
- Well, what do you think?
- Well...

38:30.255 --> 38:32.963
- it's not as good as last year's.
- Oh.

38:34.005 --> 38:35.213
But...

38:35.297 --> 38:36.380
I'll take it.

38:41.922 --> 38:42.922
What?

38:45.255 --> 38:46.255
Nothing.

38:46.380 --> 38:47.505
Happy birthday, honey.

38:49.297 --> 38:50.338
How's Maddox?

38:50.797 --> 38:51.797
Old...

38:52.380 --> 38:53.380
and hungry.

38:54.172 --> 38:55.505
Bears love bunnies.

38:56.463 --> 38:57.963
Dad, we need to hurry up.

38:58.422 --> 39:00.380
I wanna get there right when it opens.

39:00.463 --> 39:02.255
Honey, the bears
are gonna be there all day.

39:02.338 --> 39:04.880
Yeah, but brown bears are diurnal.

39:04.963 --> 39:07.203
So we have a better chance
of seeing them in the morning.

39:07.255 --> 39:08.255
Oh.

39:09.463 --> 39:11.922
Well, you know we gotta
do something first though, right?

39:12.963 --> 39:13.963
Mommy?

39:14.588 --> 39:15.672
That's right, Mommy.

39:17.463 --> 39:18.463
Eat up.

39:34.172 --> 39:35.338
And these.

39:35.588 --> 39:36.713
And some of these.

39:36.797 --> 39:38.380
These are good.

39:41.130 --> 39:42.130
And...

39:42.463 --> 39:44.255
Whatever one you want.
Or do you want pink?

39:44.338 --> 39:45.338
Maybe, yeah.

39:54.255 --> 39:55.588
Why are they so angry?

39:56.255 --> 39:59.005
Don't worry about them.
They're just celebrating your birthday.

39:59.547 --> 40:01.172
But they sound mad.

40:01.463 --> 40:04.463
Well, you know, some people
aren't happy unless they're mad.

40:05.297 --> 40:07.422
You'll see what I mean when you get older.

40:15.255 --> 40:16.255
Daddy?

40:18.922 --> 40:19.922
Daddy?

40:25.463 --> 40:26.505
Daddy, what's wrong?

40:27.422 --> 40:28.422
Nothing.

40:30.005 --> 40:31.005
Nothing's wrong.

40:40.588 --> 40:42.755
Megan's dad makes his own schedule.

40:42.838 --> 40:44.338
Megan's dad ain't a detective.

40:44.422 --> 40:45.588
He's a doctor.

40:46.297 --> 40:48.588
So, we both save lives.

40:50.713 --> 40:52.130
It's true. Hey.

40:54.588 --> 40:56.505
Detective Lockhart, yes, hello.

40:57.172 --> 40:58.755
Slow down. Slow...

40:59.922 --> 41:01.922
What do you mean it's happening again?

41:05.338 --> 41:06.338
Yeah.

41:07.297 --> 41:08.463
Yeah, I'll be right there.

41:22.338 --> 41:23.338
Sit right here.

41:25.797 --> 41:27.422
See the body yet? Back of the neck?

41:27.880 --> 41:31.255
Good morning to you, too.
Somebody get a badge for their birthday?

41:31.338 --> 41:32.797
I got the call just now.

41:32.880 --> 41:34.755
- She's eight.
- Nine.

41:36.213 --> 41:38.505
All right. Happy birthday, kiddo.

41:39.338 --> 41:40.463
Thank you, Maddox.

41:40.838 --> 41:42.297
It's fine. Don't worry, okay?

41:42.672 --> 41:43.672
Hey...

41:44.172 --> 41:46.047
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

41:47.297 --> 41:49.672
No frowning.
We're still going to the zoo, baby.

41:50.005 --> 41:51.172
Give me a pinky swear.

41:52.380 --> 41:54.422
I don't do pinky swears.

42:00.338 --> 42:01.338
Yates!

42:01.547 --> 42:03.713
Do me a solid.
Look after Amy for a second.

42:03.797 --> 42:05.588
- Uh...
- I appreciate it. Go.

42:06.005 --> 42:07.005
Hey, stay with her.

42:07.422 --> 42:09.838
- Have they been here all day?
- All day.

42:13.797 --> 42:16.713
I don't think it's a good habit
to start bringing her to work every day.

42:16.797 --> 42:17.672
It's one time.

42:17.755 --> 42:18.755
It's a crime scene.

42:18.838 --> 42:22.297
Yeah, calm down. She's in the car.
I won't have her inspecting the corpse.

42:24.172 --> 42:26.630
You didn't, uh,
put flowers on her grave, did you?

42:27.380 --> 42:28.380
Say what now?

42:28.547 --> 42:31.505
Jeanie. There were fresh flowers
on the grave this morning.

42:31.588 --> 42:32.630
No card, no note.

42:33.505 --> 42:34.505
No.

42:35.588 --> 42:36.588
All right.

43:01.755 --> 43:03.005
Nine years, huh?

43:09.380 --> 43:10.505
Political copycats?

43:13.630 --> 43:15.255
Where would they get the poison?

43:15.672 --> 43:17.755
Labbies could never reverse-engineer this.

43:21.172 --> 43:23.088
Well, well well, now it's a party.

43:23.172 --> 43:24.755
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.

43:27.088 --> 43:28.713
How's the birthday girl?

43:29.588 --> 43:31.297
Ooh, she's a whole year older.

43:34.297 --> 43:35.297
Hey, uh...

43:36.422 --> 43:39.088
You didn't go by Jeanie's grave, did you?

43:40.422 --> 43:42.297
Uh... not yet. Why?

43:43.588 --> 43:44.588
Josiah Warren.

43:46.672 --> 43:48.380
- Who's that?
- Rings a bell. Uh...

43:48.463 --> 43:51.505
It's an anarchist.
One of those Ruby Ridge types.

43:52.380 --> 43:56.005
Look at us, right back in it, all this
Market Street shit all over again.

43:56.797 --> 43:58.130
Lieutenant Holt?

43:59.547 --> 44:00.755
You guys gotta see this.

44:02.422 --> 44:05.588
- Hey, man, I'll take it from here.
- All right, let's see it. What do you got?

44:20.463 --> 44:21.588
Shit.

44:22.463 --> 44:23.672
Damn good copycat.

44:23.755 --> 44:26.755
We let these insane protesters
take it up a notch every year.

44:26.838 --> 44:29.255
- This is what we get.
- Well, up a notch to murder.

44:29.338 --> 44:32.963
It only takes one deranged enough
to dress like her and kill like her.

44:33.047 --> 44:35.047
- Really?
- If it's not one of them, who is it?

44:35.130 --> 44:37.050
I mean, come on,
you're the brilliant detectives.

44:37.130 --> 44:38.505
You got any ideas?

44:40.630 --> 44:43.505
- None of it makes any sense.
- Has anybody else seen this?

44:44.088 --> 44:47.005
- Not so far in security.
- Good, let's keep it that way.

44:47.088 --> 44:48.880
No news, no talking to reporters.

44:49.838 --> 44:52.130
Protesters are just looking
for a reason to riot.

44:52.213 --> 44:53.838
That's not your call, Detective.

45:41.422 --> 45:42.422
Lock?

45:46.297 --> 45:47.297
You good, man?

45:51.338 --> 45:52.463
Nine years, huh?

45:55.088 --> 45:57.755
You know, there was something
I never told you about that night,

45:57.838 --> 45:58.838
down in the subway.

46:00.963 --> 46:02.172
She told me things.

46:03.130 --> 46:04.213
She knew about Amy.

46:05.797 --> 46:07.713
Things she shouldn't
have been able to know.

46:08.588 --> 46:09.963
What are you talking about?

46:10.838 --> 46:12.588
She said we'd see each other again.

46:14.755 --> 46:16.838
After she died, there were no more bodies.

46:17.630 --> 46:18.797
We stopped looking.

46:19.297 --> 46:21.797
We never put together
any of the pieces because, hey,

46:22.255 --> 46:23.588
case closed, right?

46:23.672 --> 46:26.088
Well, yeah. I mean, shit.

46:29.047 --> 46:31.547
I think it's time we put together
some of the pieces.

46:33.380 --> 46:37.005
Hey, hey, find out anything you can
about these keys.

46:37.088 --> 46:38.380
- Eighty-eight?
- Yeah.

46:38.463 --> 46:39.463
You got it.

46:39.713 --> 46:42.172
- Your dad putting you to work, Amy?
<i>- </i>She's got a point.

46:42.255 --> 46:43.255
<i>Breaking news.</i>

46:43.338 --> 46:46.178
<i>We are going to go live with a briefing
about the Market Street murders.</i>

46:46.213 --> 46:47.088
Uncle Brian!

46:47.172 --> 46:49.572
<i>We have reason to believe
she's still currently in the city.</i>

46:49.630 --> 46:50.630
No, don't show her.

46:50.672 --> 46:53.505
<i>- Our suspect is wanted in connection...</i>
- Don't... don't show her.

46:53.588 --> 46:55.713
<i>With the Market Street murders of 1988.</i>

46:55.797 --> 46:57.088
Damn it! Motherfucker!

46:57.630 --> 46:58.463
Language.

46:58.547 --> 47:01.606
- Yeah, he's your uncle. Great job.
<i>- It is believed she may be connected to...</i>

47:01.630 --> 47:04.838
<i>at least two homicides
in the last 24 hours.</i>

47:06.088 --> 47:08.005
<i>She is priority number one</i>

47:08.338 --> 47:11.297
for all law enforcement agencies
in Philadelphia.

47:11.380 --> 47:13.380
- Get me, uh...
- Philly PD tip line....

47:13.463 --> 47:15.755
<i>At the present moment,
she is considered to be armed</i>

47:15.838 --> 47:16.963
<i>and extremely dangerous.</i>

47:17.047 --> 47:19.130
Yes, we are aware
the killer is a woman.

47:19.213 --> 47:22.463
<i>Now to the good people
of Philadelphia, let me assure you...</i>

47:22.922 --> 47:24.172
that apprehending this woman...

47:25.797 --> 47:28.922
<i>is our department's
primary objective.</i>

47:29.588 --> 47:30.922
<i>But we need your help.</i>

47:32.338 --> 47:35.838
<i>If you or anyone you know
has any information on his woman...</i>

47:36.880 --> 47:39.630
<i>or if you've seen anyone
who matches her description...</i>

47:40.338 --> 47:41.755
<i>do not engage,</i>

47:42.880 --> 47:44.338
<i>but call our tip line.</i>

47:45.797 --> 47:48.005
<i>Officers are standing by to hear you.</i>

47:49.338 --> 47:50.588
<i>Working together,</i>

47:51.088 --> 47:52.922
<i>we can apprehend a vicious criminal.</i>

47:54.713 --> 47:55.713
<i>Thank you.</i>

47:56.297 --> 47:57.713
And stay safe, Philadelphia.

47:58.547 --> 47:59.963
- Questions?
- Lieutenant Holt...

48:11.380 --> 48:14.564
We couldn't find anything these fuckers
had in common when there was four of 'em.

48:14.588 --> 48:16.255
Adding folks doesn't make it any easier.

48:16.880 --> 48:17.880
Yeah.

48:19.547 --> 48:21.297
These two were both left-handed.

48:23.713 --> 48:26.172
These two both voted for Perot.

48:26.422 --> 48:27.422
Shit.

48:29.755 --> 48:32.172
These two have nothing in common,

48:32.255 --> 48:34.630
except for the fact
that both their blood is red.

48:34.713 --> 48:36.630
No. It's her hand.

48:39.088 --> 48:40.088
It's her hand.

48:40.922 --> 48:41.922
What about it?

48:43.588 --> 48:45.922
We never told anybody
about her hand injury.

48:46.005 --> 48:47.838
We didn't release that to the press.

48:49.047 --> 48:51.463
How in the hell a copycat
gonna know that detail?

48:54.547 --> 48:56.005
It's nine years ago, brother.

48:56.338 --> 48:57.338
Shit gets leaked.

49:00.255 --> 49:02.047
What, you think she didn't actually die?

49:04.172 --> 49:05.422
Is that what you're saying?

49:08.213 --> 49:10.213
Please tell me
that's not what you're saying.

49:11.755 --> 49:13.422
Key is to a Falcon 160.

49:13.755 --> 49:15.213
Fairly common on small airfields.

49:15.297 --> 49:17.963
Unfortunately, there's no way
to match up the key

49:18.047 --> 49:19.422
to a specific plane.

49:19.838 --> 49:20.838
Now, hold on now.

49:21.213 --> 49:25.297
It says that this plane
was manufactured in 1996.

49:25.672 --> 49:27.380
Yeah, the model came out last year.

49:28.213 --> 49:29.213
Last year?

49:29.755 --> 49:32.088
How in the hell
did she have these keys in '88?

49:33.797 --> 49:34.797
Prototype.

49:35.755 --> 49:36.963
Eight years before?

49:38.088 --> 49:41.713
I made some calls. A hundred-mile radius,
there's only one airfield with this model.

49:46.755 --> 49:47.755
Yo, man.

49:51.922 --> 49:55.547
Uh, hey, why don't you do me a favor
and look after her until I'm back, okay?

49:59.047 --> 50:01.213
Hey, hey, hey.

50:01.297 --> 50:02.297
How you doing?

50:02.713 --> 50:03.713
Hey.

50:03.838 --> 50:06.172
I've gotta work
a little bit longer, all right?

50:06.505 --> 50:09.880
But Miss Tabitha right there, she's gonna
look after you till I get back.

50:09.963 --> 50:10.963
Okay?

50:11.130 --> 50:12.422
It's dark.

50:12.880 --> 50:14.422
The zoo's closed.

50:14.755 --> 50:15.797
Baby, I know.

50:16.672 --> 50:19.152
I'm gonna make it up to you tomorrow
when we go in the morning,

50:19.213 --> 50:21.297
'cause that's when
they're gonna be out, right?

50:21.547 --> 50:22.963
They're diurnal, remember?

50:24.088 --> 50:25.088
Mmm.

50:27.255 --> 50:28.255
I'll see you later.

50:29.422 --> 50:30.422
Let's go.

50:32.130 --> 50:35.547
I almost forgot. A Dr. Naveen Rao called
for you three times on the tip line.

50:35.630 --> 50:37.310
They wanna talk to me, they gotta come in.

50:37.338 --> 50:38.630
Yeah, that's what I told him.

50:38.713 --> 50:39.922
Detective Lockhart, excuse me.

50:40.713 --> 50:43.005
Detective Lockhart,
I've been waiting for over an hour.

50:43.880 --> 50:46.797
Hi, my name is Naveen Rao.
I'm a senior physicist at...

50:46.880 --> 50:50.172
- You have from here to the door.
- I know you've got a lot on your plate.

50:50.255 --> 50:52.935
I know what I'm going to say
will sound more like fiction than fact.

50:52.963 --> 50:54.797
The door is pretty close, by the way.

50:54.880 --> 50:58.088
I believe your case intersects
with my work in a significant way.

50:58.172 --> 51:01.630
Both appearances of the murderer have
happened during a specific lunar perigee.

51:01.713 --> 51:03.297
In this case, nine years apart.

51:03.380 --> 51:05.630
What you may know
simply as a super moon or a blood moon

51:05.713 --> 51:08.005
are actually events
of great scientific significance.

51:08.088 --> 51:08.922
Fascinating.

51:09.005 --> 51:11.064
When the lunar cycle
reaches exactly the right point,

51:11.088 --> 51:14.588
its gravitational forces react
with electromagnetic pockets and...

51:15.172 --> 51:16.213
Hey, whoa!

51:16.963 --> 51:20.005
Theoretically creates a kind of bridge.

51:22.463 --> 51:23.963
Yeah, bridge to where?

51:24.505 --> 51:26.130
Another place entirely.

51:31.130 --> 51:32.172
My advice:

51:32.380 --> 51:33.755
take it to Channel Five.

51:34.338 --> 51:35.672
They'll eat this shit up.

52:25.963 --> 52:28.088
Well, it's locked.

52:29.130 --> 52:31.005
Time to call it a night. Let's go home.

52:34.838 --> 52:36.797
Oh, you see that? Someone's here.

52:38.463 --> 52:39.505
We gotta go in.

52:41.297 --> 52:42.797
Don't do this, man, not like this.

52:42.880 --> 52:45.047
Hey, you got a better idea, I'm all ears.

52:47.213 --> 52:48.297
You've got that look.

52:49.088 --> 52:51.588
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know.

52:51.672 --> 52:52.672
No, I don't know.

52:54.130 --> 52:55.850
Don't use this
as some kind of fucked-up way

52:55.922 --> 52:57.922
of dealing with what happened
to Jeanie.

53:01.088 --> 53:02.088
Lock.

53:02.297 --> 53:03.588
Leave it alone.

53:03.672 --> 53:04.672
Don't...

53:06.922 --> 53:07.922
Lock.

53:11.255 --> 53:12.255
Lock!

53:21.422 --> 53:22.505
Hey, how'd you get in here?

53:22.588 --> 53:25.297
Hey. Detective Lockhart. Uh, Philly PD.

53:27.297 --> 53:28.297
You, uh...

53:30.755 --> 53:31.963
seen this woman?

53:33.088 --> 53:34.213
Can't say that I have.

53:43.422 --> 53:45.297
- Everything all right tonight?
- Yeah.

53:46.005 --> 53:47.463
Yeah, everything's fine. Why?

53:51.130 --> 53:52.130
No, just...

53:53.005 --> 53:54.297
you're here kind of late.

53:54.380 --> 53:55.380
Yeah, I had a...

53:55.755 --> 53:57.088
I had a guy call in and cancel.

53:57.172 --> 53:59.463
But, you know,
still gotta do the paperwork, right?

54:00.838 --> 54:02.213
Never enough paperwork.

54:02.922 --> 54:04.713
No. No, there never is.

54:06.672 --> 54:07.672
Ah...

54:10.630 --> 54:11.630
Well, okay.

54:12.672 --> 54:13.672
Ah...

54:15.380 --> 54:17.338
Well, you know, let me give you my number.

54:18.505 --> 54:20.005
In case anything...

54:20.630 --> 54:22.172
you know, comes to mind.

54:31.463 --> 54:32.588
Yeah.

54:32.672 --> 54:33.922
Thanks. Yeah.

54:34.005 --> 54:35.797
Thanks. Maybe I will.

54:37.963 --> 54:40.005
All right. Oh, uh, you know,
before I forget...

54:41.088 --> 54:41.963
uh,

54:42.047 --> 54:44.963
what's the best way to get back
to the turnpike from here?

54:46.255 --> 54:47.588
Could you draw me a map?

54:50.005 --> 54:51.005
Sure.

54:55.088 --> 54:56.297
It's, uh...

54:59.588 --> 55:00.588
It's that way.

55:02.047 --> 55:03.047
Appreciate that.

55:09.297 --> 55:10.297
Hey, Tom.

55:13.047 --> 55:14.255
Nice to see you again.

55:15.505 --> 55:17.130
Holy shit, it is you.

55:17.213 --> 55:18.213
Gun on the floor.

55:18.713 --> 55:19.713
Yeah.

55:25.422 --> 55:26.982
If you were a better shot, I'd be dead.

55:28.380 --> 55:30.422
Now, sit down.

55:31.088 --> 55:32.255
- Sit!
- Yeah.

55:36.588 --> 55:37.713
Tape his wrists.

55:38.172 --> 55:40.172
- Tape his wrists!
- Okay, okay.

55:40.255 --> 55:41.838
- Let's go! Move it!
- Easy.

55:44.505 --> 55:46.630
Just stay calm. Relax.

55:50.838 --> 55:52.422
- Faster.
- I'm trying.

55:58.797 --> 55:59.797
Lock.

56:00.422 --> 56:02.255
Hello? Hello?

56:03.838 --> 56:05.463
- Okay.
- You.

56:05.922 --> 56:07.588
Get me the key to that plane outside.

56:07.880 --> 56:08.963
- Okay.
- Move!

56:10.755 --> 56:11.922
I saw you die.

56:13.005 --> 56:14.338
Yeah, you did.

56:16.922 --> 56:18.505
- Here it is.
- Toss me the keys.

56:18.588 --> 56:21.088
Yeah. It's one... it's one lock 206.

56:31.588 --> 56:33.255
Stay down! You too!

56:33.338 --> 56:34.422
All right, all right.

56:34.505 --> 56:36.213
Shit.

56:44.672 --> 56:46.047
Now you're coming with me.

56:48.505 --> 56:50.005
- Yeah, yeah.
- Nose on the floor!

56:54.088 --> 56:55.005
Move it!

56:55.088 --> 56:56.547
I'm running out of time!

56:56.630 --> 56:57.630
Freeze, bitch!

57:04.047 --> 57:05.547
- No.
- Maddox?

57:26.630 --> 57:27.630
Lock?

57:27.713 --> 57:28.838
Hey! Don't shoot!

57:29.588 --> 57:31.005
Don't shoot! Nobody shoot!

57:31.422 --> 57:32.422
Don't risk it!

57:34.255 --> 57:36.380
Somebody give me
some fuckin' bolt cutters!

57:37.838 --> 57:38.963
Fuck me.

58:24.922 --> 58:25.922
Tom?

58:26.588 --> 58:27.588
Thomas?

58:28.255 --> 58:29.255
Hey.

58:31.172 --> 58:32.172
Listen.

58:33.422 --> 58:35.130
You have to stop chasing me.

58:36.130 --> 58:37.755
I'm doing all this for a reason.

58:38.838 --> 58:40.380
I'm saving people's lives.

58:43.505 --> 58:44.713
You murdered my partner.

58:44.797 --> 58:46.588
That was never part of the plan.

58:50.630 --> 58:52.463
How the hell are you alive?

58:55.130 --> 58:56.422
Every nine years...

58:57.463 --> 58:58.797
when the moon sets,

58:59.255 --> 59:00.255
I can come back.

59:00.797 --> 59:01.880
But not for long.

59:03.380 --> 59:04.380
The moon?

59:06.088 --> 59:08.338
What do you mean come back? Huh?

59:08.422 --> 59:11.505
The more I tell you,
the more you'll keep coming after me.

59:11.797 --> 59:13.963
And I've seen how that turns out for you.

59:15.755 --> 59:17.547
You can choose to stop.

59:18.172 --> 59:19.297
Go home to your daughter.

59:20.630 --> 59:22.505
Pretend none of this ever happened.

59:23.713 --> 59:25.005
Yeah, can't do that.

59:26.130 --> 59:27.130
Hey.

59:28.130 --> 59:30.380
- I don't have any more time.
- What are you doing? Whoa!

1:01:37.630 --> 1:01:39.255
What the fuck were you thinking?

1:01:41.755 --> 1:01:44.338
There's a dozen different ways
you could have died.

1:01:46.255 --> 1:01:47.755
Goddammit.

1:01:50.088 --> 1:01:51.088
Look...

1:01:53.047 --> 1:01:54.297
- Hey.
- I'm sorry...

1:01:55.255 --> 1:01:56.297
about Maddox.

1:01:56.588 --> 1:01:57.588
Sir.

1:01:58.130 --> 1:02:01.172
We'll continue searching the area,
but so far, there's still no sign of her.

1:02:01.922 --> 1:02:02.922
Well, keep looking.

1:02:05.755 --> 1:02:07.047
You won't find anything.

1:02:09.588 --> 1:02:10.630
She's gone, Holt.

1:02:12.005 --> 1:02:13.213
Just like the last time.

1:02:15.588 --> 1:02:17.047
What's that supposed to mean?

1:02:19.088 --> 1:02:20.338
She's gone back.

1:02:23.213 --> 1:02:24.213
Where?

1:02:25.255 --> 1:02:26.255
The future.

1:02:28.922 --> 1:02:30.755
She's from the future.

1:04:04.505 --> 1:04:06.672
<i>Philadelphia,
their whole, white uniforms,</i>

1:04:06.755 --> 1:04:08.981
<i>Iverson going left to right,

<i>Take a break here...</i>

1:04:38.422 --> 1:04:39.505
Tomorrow, buddy.

1:04:42.755 --> 1:04:44.130
This time we're gonna get her.

1:04:45.588 --> 1:04:47.838
<i>Mr. Lockhart,
in answer to your numerous inquiries,</i>

1:04:47.922 --> 1:04:51.255
<i>Dr. Rao has been working
in the private sector for the past decade.</i>

1:04:51.338 --> 1:04:54.005
<i>And he has had no recent contact
with this office.</i>

1:04:54.338 --> 1:04:58.130
<i>And even if he did, policy prevents me
from giving out information</i>

1:04:58.213 --> 1:05:00.713
<i>- of any employee or previous...</i>

1:06:03.755 --> 1:06:04.838
Hang on.

1:06:06.297 --> 1:06:08.005
- What?
- Mrs. Nowak?

1:06:08.630 --> 1:06:09.505
Yeah.

1:06:09.588 --> 1:06:12.005
Thomas Lockhart. I'm...
I'm a private investigator.

1:06:12.088 --> 1:06:15.338
Wonder if I could just ask you
a few questions about your husband.

1:06:16.838 --> 1:06:18.130
Harold's dead.

1:06:18.838 --> 1:06:20.797
I'm aware of that. Um...

1:06:21.297 --> 1:06:22.297
I'm...

1:06:22.547 --> 1:06:25.213
gathering information
on local drug overdose cases.

1:06:25.297 --> 1:06:27.297
Where were you 18 years ago?

1:06:29.672 --> 1:06:30.672
May I come in?

1:06:34.963 --> 1:06:36.547
Don't let the cat out.

1:06:49.880 --> 1:06:52.755
I went away to see my sister
for a week or so.

1:06:53.213 --> 1:06:54.297
Came back...

1:06:55.005 --> 1:06:56.255
found Harold...

1:06:56.922 --> 1:06:58.047
on the floor.

1:06:58.963 --> 1:07:00.922
Cracked his head open
on the desk when he fell.

1:07:03.213 --> 1:07:04.338
Blood...

1:07:04.880 --> 1:07:05.922
everywhere.

1:07:08.880 --> 1:07:10.755
All turned black.

1:07:12.380 --> 1:07:14.505
Still got one of them flags in here.

1:07:25.797 --> 1:07:28.297
Your husband, he, um... wrote these?

1:07:28.630 --> 1:07:30.672
Those and a lot more.

1:07:31.338 --> 1:07:33.297
Sent them all over the country

1:07:33.672 --> 1:07:35.297
hidden in these books.

1:07:37.755 --> 1:07:41.088
Let people have some privacy
about their ideas.

1:07:43.088 --> 1:07:45.297
Had quite a following.

1:07:48.963 --> 1:07:51.172
The movement was his thing.

1:07:52.922 --> 1:07:53.922
Were you into it?

1:07:56.422 --> 1:07:58.880
I was young and he a good dope.

1:08:00.047 --> 1:08:01.963
But he took it pretty serious.

1:08:03.255 --> 1:08:04.255
How serious?

1:08:05.880 --> 1:08:07.463
Enough to freak me out.

1:08:12.338 --> 1:08:15.047
You don't know, um,
who he mailed all these to, do you?

1:08:19.422 --> 1:08:20.422
Give me a minute.

1:08:31.630 --> 1:08:32.630
Who's the girl?

1:08:33.505 --> 1:08:35.047
Heather Russell, Harold's ex.

1:08:36.463 --> 1:08:38.380
You heard of drinking the Kool-Aid?

1:08:38.463 --> 1:08:40.463
She fuckin' made the Kool-Aid.

1:08:43.047 --> 1:08:45.130
So they were working on this together?

1:08:45.213 --> 1:08:47.588
Until they split, crazy bitch.

1:08:48.505 --> 1:08:49.625
You know where she's at now?

1:08:50.213 --> 1:08:53.463
You keep track of the people
that fucked your wife before you did?

1:08:57.505 --> 1:08:58.505
Here you go.

1:08:59.380 --> 1:09:00.547
Mailing list.

1:09:03.713 --> 1:09:05.547
Seems pretty important to you.

1:09:09.880 --> 1:09:10.880
Suppose it is.

1:09:11.797 --> 1:09:13.005
Then I'd say...

1:09:14.255 --> 1:09:16.547
I've been pretty generous with my time.

1:09:18.047 --> 1:09:20.255
Lots of other things
a girl could be doing.

1:09:22.380 --> 1:09:23.380
Hmm.

1:09:25.588 --> 1:09:28.547
Well, what do you propose, Arleen?

1:09:30.713 --> 1:09:32.088
How much you got on you?

1:09:49.005 --> 1:09:50.547
Asherdowns.

1:09:56.422 --> 1:09:57.630
Asherdowns.

1:10:08.630 --> 1:10:09.713
Holy shit.

1:10:16.588 --> 1:10:18.172
<i>You've reached Captain Brian Holt.</i>

1:10:18.255 --> 1:10:19.606
- Come on.
<i>- Please leave a message.</i>

1:10:19.630 --> 1:10:21.797
<i>I'll get back to you soon as possible.</i>

1:10:21.880 --> 1:10:22.963
Hey, it's me.

1:10:23.588 --> 1:10:24.713
We gotta meet tonight.

1:10:25.005 --> 1:10:26.213
Think I found something.

1:10:27.047 --> 1:10:28.380
Might be a big something.

1:10:29.172 --> 1:10:31.255
And if it's, uh, not too big of a...
of an ask,

1:10:31.338 --> 1:10:34.213
I need you to run a current address
on a Heather Russell.

1:10:35.172 --> 1:10:36.172
Call me.

1:10:36.380 --> 1:10:37.380
Bye.

1:10:51.297 --> 1:10:52.297
Hey, kiddo!

1:10:55.797 --> 1:10:56.963
I'm sorry I'm late.

1:10:57.797 --> 1:10:58.963
Got caught up.

1:11:01.297 --> 1:11:03.672
That beard's ridiculous.
You look like a homeless person.

1:11:04.713 --> 1:11:06.297
And it's good to see you.

1:11:11.755 --> 1:11:12.880
Got time for a...

1:11:13.630 --> 1:11:15.588
late lunch or dinner?

1:11:16.130 --> 1:11:18.963
Can't. Aunt Maggie's taking me
to King of Prussia.

1:11:20.172 --> 1:11:22.380
I could've taken you
to King of Prussia, too, you know?

1:11:22.463 --> 1:11:25.005
It's a girl's thing we're doing.
Not really your scene.

1:11:25.088 --> 1:11:26.422
Oh, okay.

1:11:33.672 --> 1:11:34.672
How's school?

1:11:35.047 --> 1:11:37.887
Guidance counselor thinks I have
a good shot at the scholarship to Penn.

1:11:40.838 --> 1:11:42.505
Thought you wanted to go out of state.

1:11:42.922 --> 1:11:44.838
George is gonna stay around here, so...

1:11:45.463 --> 1:11:47.297
- Oh, what, the football guy?
- Yep.

1:11:47.380 --> 1:11:48.380
Ah.

1:11:48.755 --> 1:11:50.672
Right, you told me about him before.

1:11:51.463 --> 1:11:52.463
You've met him,

1:11:52.797 --> 1:11:53.880
like, twice.

1:11:56.463 --> 1:11:57.672
Yeah, nice guy.

1:12:02.047 --> 1:12:03.880
How's staying with Holt working out?

1:12:04.297 --> 1:12:05.297
Good.

1:12:06.338 --> 1:12:07.755
Closer to school, so...

1:12:09.797 --> 1:12:10.713
Good, I'm glad.

1:12:10.797 --> 1:12:11.922
It's for the best.

1:12:12.005 --> 1:12:14.505
I mean, for now, you know, honey.
I mean, it's just temporary.

1:12:14.838 --> 1:12:16.880
I'll be back on track soon enough.

1:12:24.338 --> 1:12:25.797
Seriously, Dad, still?

1:12:25.880 --> 1:12:27.880
Uh, you know, somebody's gotta find him.

1:12:30.547 --> 1:12:32.213
Yeah, I gotta work.

1:12:33.880 --> 1:12:35.297
I'm close this time, Ames.

1:12:37.588 --> 1:12:38.588
Real close.

1:12:40.463 --> 1:12:41.463
You'll see.

1:12:49.255 --> 1:12:50.838
Ah, bada-bing, bada-boom!

1:12:50.922 --> 1:12:51.922
Here we go.

1:12:55.172 --> 1:12:57.672
Why do you still have a scanner?
You're not a cop anymore.

1:12:59.338 --> 1:13:01.255
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey.

1:13:02.338 --> 1:13:03.838
Almost forgot the whole thing.

1:13:04.755 --> 1:13:05.880
Happy birthday, kiddo.

1:13:15.672 --> 1:13:16.672
For your bracelet.

1:13:22.213 --> 1:13:24.213
Dad, I haven't worn that thing in years.

1:13:27.297 --> 1:13:28.297
Oh.

1:13:32.547 --> 1:13:34.130
Well, I kept the receipt, so...

1:13:35.922 --> 1:13:36.922
Thanks for trying.

1:13:46.547 --> 1:13:48.963
Look, Ames, I know how things have been.

1:13:51.005 --> 1:13:52.005
I get it.

1:13:53.797 --> 1:13:55.838
I'm not Mr. Ideal Dad or whatever.

1:13:58.713 --> 1:14:00.755
But I'm gonna finish this thing soon.

1:14:03.088 --> 1:14:06.213
I promise you,
and then we're gonna get back to normal.

1:14:06.588 --> 1:14:08.588
Just me and you, just like old times.

1:14:08.963 --> 1:14:11.047
Dad, that's not how things work.
You can't just...

1:14:16.172 --> 1:14:17.422
You gotta let it go.

1:14:20.672 --> 1:14:21.672
And seriously,

1:14:21.880 --> 1:14:22.880
lose the beard.

1:14:23.838 --> 1:14:24.838
Right.

1:14:25.172 --> 1:14:26.172
Hey...

1:14:26.505 --> 1:14:27.588
Uncle Brian home?

1:14:28.088 --> 1:14:29.088
Bye, Dad.

1:14:29.463 --> 1:14:30.588
You have him call me!

1:15:14.463 --> 1:15:15.463
Hey.

1:15:21.172 --> 1:15:22.255
You got that address?

1:15:22.422 --> 1:15:23.547
Heather Russell?

1:15:25.922 --> 1:15:27.547
Yeah, that's why you're here, right?

1:15:28.255 --> 1:15:30.338
Look, for Jane and for Amy's sake,

1:15:30.422 --> 1:15:31.547
I've been patient.

1:15:31.630 --> 1:15:33.505
Hey, hey, we missed one of our victims.

1:15:36.380 --> 1:15:37.505
Harold Nowak.

1:15:38.838 --> 1:15:40.880
Just outside our jurisdiction, so...

1:15:41.297 --> 1:15:44.505
Local boys wrote it off as a drug overdose
so we never caught it.

1:15:48.588 --> 1:15:49.672
How'd you get that?

1:15:50.172 --> 1:15:51.297
He was a nut.

1:15:52.255 --> 1:15:53.547
Had a fringe militia club.

1:15:53.630 --> 1:15:54.755
The Real American Movement.

1:15:54.838 --> 1:15:57.005
Wanted to take the country back
for the true patriots.

1:15:57.088 --> 1:15:59.922
You know, homemade fertilizer bombs.
You know the type.

1:16:02.713 --> 1:16:04.005
And I got his mailing list.

1:16:06.422 --> 1:16:08.880
Two of the four victims from '97
were on it.

1:16:08.963 --> 1:16:11.422
All of 'em from '88,
that's the connection.

1:16:12.338 --> 1:16:14.018
They're all part of this radical movement.

1:16:14.088 --> 1:16:16.005
- Tom.
- They were up to something big.

1:16:16.588 --> 1:16:18.838
And I'm thinking that isotope
that she injects them with

1:16:18.922 --> 1:16:21.463
is some high-tech way
of killing people remotely.

1:16:21.880 --> 1:16:23.922
And it's triggered
from the future, maybe. I...

1:16:24.005 --> 1:16:25.047
I don't know. I don't...

1:16:25.130 --> 1:16:27.088
I don't entirely
have that pinned down yet.

1:16:27.172 --> 1:16:29.505
- Tom...
- You remember Naveen Rao

1:16:29.588 --> 1:16:31.548
and his theory
about the lunar cycle bridge thing?

1:16:31.630 --> 1:16:32.755
Jesus, Tom.

1:16:33.172 --> 1:16:34.588
Had to do with the moon.

1:16:36.172 --> 1:16:37.172
You need help.

1:16:42.088 --> 1:16:43.088
You don't get it.

1:16:44.630 --> 1:16:47.630
She gets torn apart by a train
and nine years later she's back,

1:16:47.713 --> 1:16:48.880
alive and killing.

1:16:53.797 --> 1:16:54.797
Listen.

1:16:58.297 --> 1:16:59.672
We're all going forward.

1:17:00.880 --> 1:17:01.880
But her...

1:17:02.380 --> 1:17:03.505
She's going backward.

1:17:04.088 --> 1:17:05.672
Decade by decade.

1:17:06.130 --> 1:17:07.838
So that shit in '97...

1:17:08.547 --> 1:17:09.797
she didn't come back to life.

1:17:11.755 --> 1:17:13.672
She just wasn't dead yet.

1:17:13.755 --> 1:17:15.005
You sound insane.

1:17:15.547 --> 1:17:19.338
Okay? You sound like a fuckin'
insane person right now. You need help.

1:17:21.088 --> 1:17:22.755
She knew things about me, Holt.

1:17:24.630 --> 1:17:26.213
She knew things about Jeanie,

1:17:26.588 --> 1:17:27.588
and Amy.

1:17:28.422 --> 1:17:29.922
Things that she couldn't know.

1:17:30.422 --> 1:17:31.963
And she killed Maddox.

1:17:33.672 --> 1:17:35.130
She's coming back again...

1:17:36.088 --> 1:17:37.088
and it's today.

1:17:40.130 --> 1:17:41.130
Do you...?

1:17:42.338 --> 1:17:44.018
Have you completely lost
your fuckin' mind?

1:17:44.088 --> 1:17:47.880
You're talking about a case...
that's been cold for a fuckin' decade.

1:17:47.963 --> 1:17:51.130
You know how many murders
I've had in the past week?

1:17:51.880 --> 1:17:54.213
I'm raising your own daughter,
for Christ sake,

1:17:54.297 --> 1:17:57.047
and you're coming to me
with fucking time travel?

1:18:00.422 --> 1:18:02.172
Are you even listening to yourself?

1:18:08.463 --> 1:18:09.505
You're all I got.

1:18:10.755 --> 1:18:12.755
I couldn't stop what happened to Jeanie.

1:18:13.255 --> 1:18:14.380
But I can stop her.

1:18:15.463 --> 1:18:17.755
This is Harold Nowak's wife.

1:18:18.672 --> 1:18:20.588
This is his muse.

1:18:22.547 --> 1:18:24.255
All I want is her address.

1:18:24.547 --> 1:18:27.047
And I won't ask you for nothing
ever again.

1:18:27.922 --> 1:18:28.922
I promise.

1:18:29.922 --> 1:18:30.922
Please.

1:18:35.922 --> 1:18:38.588
You're chasing moonbeams
while your own life got away.

1:18:39.880 --> 1:18:41.755
It's just fucking sad to watch.

1:18:42.838 --> 1:18:44.838
It's sad that Amy has to watch it.

1:18:53.297 --> 1:18:54.297
Is it worth it?

1:19:12.797 --> 1:19:13.797
Maybe you're right.

1:19:17.505 --> 1:19:18.505
Maybe I...

1:19:19.130 --> 1:19:20.172
maybe I need help.

1:19:25.213 --> 1:19:26.880
I'm sorry for all the shit, man.

1:19:27.963 --> 1:19:31.463
And I'm sorry
for you taking care of Amy and, uh...

1:19:37.422 --> 1:19:38.755
Oh, I'm a fucking mess.

1:19:39.172 --> 1:19:40.505
Hey.

1:19:40.588 --> 1:19:41.588
Hey.

1:19:42.547 --> 1:19:44.047
Take it easy.

1:19:44.422 --> 1:19:46.130
Please. Come on, it's okay.

1:19:47.338 --> 1:19:48.463
All right?

1:19:50.005 --> 1:19:51.005
Hey.

1:19:51.213 --> 1:19:52.213
Listen.

1:19:52.672 --> 1:19:55.755
If you're serious about getting out,
I got your back.

1:20:02.630 --> 1:20:03.838
Thank you, brother.

1:20:04.422 --> 1:20:05.255
Okay.

1:20:05.422 --> 1:20:06.422
Hey.

1:20:06.963 --> 1:20:08.130
Take care of yourself.

1:20:08.505 --> 1:20:10.338
I'm gonna give
the department shrink a call.

1:20:11.047 --> 1:20:12.880
See if she can make a recommendation.

1:20:13.630 --> 1:20:15.088
Okay. I'll do it.

1:20:15.838 --> 1:20:16.963
I'm gonna owe you one.

1:20:17.755 --> 1:20:18.838
You're a good man, Holt.

1:20:19.338 --> 1:20:21.088
No, I'm a dick and I know it.

1:20:21.172 --> 1:20:23.005
But you're family, so...

1:20:24.630 --> 1:20:26.755
That's what we do, right?
We take care of each other.

1:20:26.838 --> 1:20:27.838
Even the crazy ones.

1:20:30.422 --> 1:20:31.422
I'll call you.

1:20:41.505 --> 1:20:43.672
<i>Yes, hi, this is, uh, Captain Holt.</i>

1:20:44.547 --> 1:20:47.922
I just need a last known address
for a Heather Russell.

1:20:50.047 --> 1:20:51.047
Just a second.

1:20:51.755 --> 1:20:53.755
Badge number 0304.

1:20:56.672 --> 1:20:57.672
Yep.

1:21:01.130 --> 1:21:02.130
Uh-huh.

1:21:02.630 --> 1:21:04.005
Yeah, ready when you are.

1:21:33.422 --> 1:21:36.172
<i>Save up to 80 percent
by buying factory direct.</i>

1:21:36.255 --> 1:21:37.672
Ms. Russell?

1:21:37.755 --> 1:21:40.338
<i>A direct diamond importer
and manufactures factory direct.</i>

1:21:40.422 --> 1:21:43.130
<i>The Jewelry Factory has thousands
of diamonds and setting mounds</i>

1:21:43.213 --> 1:21:45.088
<i>and guarantees the lowest price.</i>

1:21:45.172 --> 1:21:46.532
<i>The Jewelry Factory's one-carat...</i>

1:21:46.588 --> 1:21:49.505
Ms. Russell, mind if I come in?

1:21:49.588 --> 1:21:50.713
<i>Are 899.</i>

1:21:50.797 --> 1:21:53.047
<i>Three-quarter-carat bracelets are 149.</i>

1:21:53.505 --> 1:21:54.505
Hello?

1:21:54.880 --> 1:21:57.213
<i>And one-carat studs are 399.</i>

1:22:56.713 --> 1:22:57.713
Ah!

1:23:06.255 --> 1:23:07.672
Hey! Stop, stop, stop, stop!

1:23:09.672 --> 1:23:11.422
Get out of the car. Get out.

1:23:11.505 --> 1:23:12.505
Get out!

1:25:55.797 --> 1:25:56.797
Damn it.

1:25:56.963 --> 1:25:57.963
Fuck!

1:27:12.963 --> 1:27:13.963
No!

1:27:25.713 --> 1:27:26.713
Fuck!

1:27:33.963 --> 1:27:35.088
I'll see you soon.

1:28:14.380 --> 1:28:15.588
<i>Holt! Holt!</i>

1:28:16.005 --> 1:28:17.213
I shot her in the hand!

1:28:17.755 --> 1:28:19.005
This is when she gets shot.

1:28:19.088 --> 1:28:20.922
I'm the one who did it.
It already happened!

1:28:21.005 --> 1:28:22.963
But we've gotta wait
nine more years, Holt.

1:28:23.463 --> 1:28:24.338
We've gotta wait!

1:28:24.422 --> 1:28:26.862
But listen, if we kill her,
we can stop it all from happening.

1:28:26.922 --> 1:28:28.547
I could be there for Jeanie, Holt.

1:28:28.630 --> 1:28:30.505
We can stop it all from happening, Holt!

1:28:31.088 --> 1:28:31.922
Listen to me!

1:28:32.005 --> 1:28:33.755
Hey, listen to me!

1:28:34.713 --> 1:28:35.713
Listen!

1:29:10.338 --> 1:29:11.338
Record.

1:29:12.797 --> 1:29:15.380
Timestream location and determination.

1:29:15.963 --> 1:29:17.130
Trial number 32.

1:29:20.338 --> 1:29:22.297
Injecting marks one through three.

1:29:32.880 --> 1:29:33.880
Now...

1:29:34.588 --> 1:29:38.047
attempting termination
of marks one through three.

1:29:58.297 --> 1:30:00.547
I have brain dissolution on mark one.

1:30:01.880 --> 1:30:03.547
And on marks two and three.

1:30:09.797 --> 1:30:11.255
I think we may have a winner.

1:30:12.630 --> 1:30:14.380
With the pairing of the coronal isotopes,

1:30:14.463 --> 1:30:18.172
we could eventually be triggering
this solution from a future point in time.

1:30:18.255 --> 1:30:20.130
Dr. Rao?

1:30:27.005 --> 1:30:28.005
Damn it.

1:31:07.213 --> 1:31:08.922
<i>Hey, Daddy. It's me.</i>

1:31:09.588 --> 1:31:10.588
<i>It's, um...</i>

1:31:11.255 --> 1:31:12.630
<i>been a while, so...</i>

1:31:13.505 --> 1:31:14.672
<i>I'm calling because...</i>

1:31:15.838 --> 1:31:17.047
<i>The baby's due soon.</i>

1:31:17.588 --> 1:31:19.338
<i>Really soon, and, um...</i>

1:31:19.880 --> 1:31:22.088
<i>George and I
have been talking it over and...</i>

1:31:23.130 --> 1:31:24.713
<i>I'd like you to be here for it.</i>

1:31:27.338 --> 1:31:29.713
<i>I think it's what Mom
would have wanted, and...</i>

1:31:31.172 --> 1:31:33.255
<i>I think it's what I want too, so...</i>

1:31:36.213 --> 1:31:37.213
<i>I know...</i>

1:31:37.963 --> 1:31:39.838
<i>I know it's that time of year again,</i>

1:31:39.922 --> 1:31:43.172
<i>and I know things between us have been...</i>

1:31:45.880 --> 1:31:48.005
<i>But I'd still love it
if you could make it.</i>

1:31:49.088 --> 1:31:50.297
<i>Either way, please...</i>

1:31:51.005 --> 1:31:52.047
<i>call me back.</i>

1:32:09.255 --> 1:32:10.463
<i>Daddy, what's wrong?</i>

1:32:20.713 --> 1:32:22.463
I knew you'd be back,
Mr. Lockhart.

1:32:23.255 --> 1:32:25.005
I really am sorry about all this.

1:32:27.672 --> 1:32:31.213
You're a hard man to find, Rao.
You disappeared on me.

1:32:31.838 --> 1:32:34.463
Of all people, you should understand
an obsession with work.

1:32:34.547 --> 1:32:37.380
Yeah, speaking of work,
you can just let me out right here.

1:32:38.047 --> 1:32:39.672
I'm afraid I cannot do that.

1:32:39.755 --> 1:32:41.713
If you don't, she keeps killing.

1:32:41.797 --> 1:32:42.838
That is the plan.

1:32:44.047 --> 1:32:45.927
Changing the world
is a bloody business, Thomas.

1:32:47.213 --> 1:32:48.213
Fucking crazy.

1:32:49.838 --> 1:32:52.588
I think we're both a little
beyond the pale, really.

1:32:57.547 --> 1:33:00.463
I'll be keeping you in a safe place
for the next few days.

1:33:01.130 --> 1:33:02.297
Then you'll be let go.

1:33:03.588 --> 1:33:04.672
But truthfully...

1:33:05.422 --> 1:33:06.963
I have to thank you.

1:33:08.213 --> 1:33:12.088
It was your investigation that made me
realize she wasn't a murderer at all...

1:33:12.713 --> 1:33:13.797
but a savior,

1:33:14.880 --> 1:33:19.172
and a culmination of my own research.

1:33:19.255 --> 1:33:21.838
I'm developing the technology
she'll use one day.

1:33:21.922 --> 1:33:22.922
Well...

1:33:23.088 --> 1:33:24.838
is using now, really.

1:33:25.713 --> 1:33:28.505
Time travel is complicated.
Hard for even me to wrap my head around.

1:33:28.588 --> 1:33:30.130
She's killing innocent people!

1:33:30.213 --> 1:33:33.338
To stop something much, much worse.

1:33:35.297 --> 1:33:37.880
Imagine you could erase
the American Civil War.

1:33:38.797 --> 1:33:39.797
How would you do it?

1:33:40.755 --> 1:33:42.088
Would you kill Jefferson Davis?

1:33:42.172 --> 1:33:44.797
Robert E. Lee? Lincoln?
All the Confederate and Union leaders?

1:33:45.547 --> 1:33:47.838
But that might not be enough
to erase an idea.

1:33:48.838 --> 1:33:51.255
Maybe we have to kill the people
who made them who they are,

1:33:51.338 --> 1:33:54.130
who gave them their moral
and political beliefs.

1:33:54.672 --> 1:33:56.505
Friends, fathers, mothers, grandparents.

1:33:58.047 --> 1:34:02.047
How far back would you have to go
to snuff out the spark that lit the fuse?

1:34:03.047 --> 1:34:06.672
But if you eliminated
the right combination of people,

1:34:06.755 --> 1:34:08.297
one by one,

1:34:08.380 --> 1:34:10.172
until you got to the exact start of it,

1:34:10.255 --> 1:34:13.088
until you got to the one
that undoes it all...

1:34:14.172 --> 1:34:16.255
you could reshape the future.

1:34:17.588 --> 1:34:19.005
And that's what she's doing.

1:34:20.422 --> 1:34:22.005
And I won't let you stop her.

1:34:25.588 --> 1:34:27.005
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1:34:29.172 --> 1:34:31.713
We can't feel it's pull,
but we know it's always there.

1:34:32.130 --> 1:34:33.338
Nothing escapes it.

1:34:34.755 --> 1:34:37.963
You know, the moon is responsible
for conditions that allow life on Earth.

1:34:38.963 --> 1:34:41.797
Well, now, it's responsible
for us being able to save ourselves

1:34:41.880 --> 1:34:43.547
from ourselves.

1:34:45.047 --> 1:34:47.755
- It's... amazing.
- Yeah.

1:36:15.505 --> 1:36:16.505
Shit!

1:36:16.963 --> 1:36:18.088
Lock!

1:36:19.963 --> 1:36:21.213
Stop!

1:36:24.630 --> 1:36:26.338
Lock!

1:36:27.463 --> 1:36:29.130
Don't do this!

1:36:31.880 --> 1:36:33.963
You have to let her finish!

1:37:56.130 --> 1:37:57.130
Morning.

1:38:04.797 --> 1:38:06.338
You know, when I kill you...

1:38:08.172 --> 1:38:10.047
you'll never be able to kill anybody.

1:38:15.172 --> 1:38:17.922
Some version of me
won't have to chase you.

1:38:21.838 --> 1:38:23.297
If you kill me now...

1:38:25.255 --> 1:38:27.130
the world as you know it will end

1:38:27.713 --> 1:38:29.338
in a very short time.

1:38:29.922 --> 1:38:31.505
And you have no idea...

1:38:32.130 --> 1:38:33.130
what's coming.

1:38:34.463 --> 1:38:36.922
You're not the only one
trying to change the past.

1:38:38.838 --> 1:38:40.547
I'll be a regular guy.

1:38:43.463 --> 1:38:44.547
Regular family.

1:38:54.755 --> 1:38:55.755
No.

1:38:58.547 --> 1:38:59.630
You don't kill me.

1:39:04.047 --> 1:39:05.047
'Cause I know you.

1:39:10.588 --> 1:39:12.172
I've known you my entire life.

1:39:14.838 --> 1:39:16.922
You're the one
who told me to take this job.

1:39:24.422 --> 1:39:26.713
And you taught me how to ride a bicycle.

1:39:31.380 --> 1:39:33.963
You made me my first ice cream pancakes.

1:39:38.755 --> 1:39:40.880
And you held me on the day I was born.

1:39:51.338 --> 1:39:52.755
This was my mother's.

1:40:20.005 --> 1:40:21.213
You're my granddaughter.

1:40:28.505 --> 1:40:29.713
Believe it or not,

1:40:30.380 --> 1:40:32.505
you actually come around
to what I'm doing.

1:40:37.630 --> 1:40:38.630
It's okay.

1:40:41.588 --> 1:40:42.588
It's over.

1:40:48.713 --> 1:40:49.713
No, no.

1:40:50.630 --> 1:40:51.630
No.

1:40:52.338 --> 1:40:53.463
But I do kill you.

1:40:54.130 --> 1:40:55.255
Twenty-seven years ago.

1:40:56.630 --> 1:40:57.672
I watched you die.

1:40:59.672 --> 1:41:00.755
You have to go back.

1:41:01.713 --> 1:41:04.005
You have to go back
and you have to stop me.

1:41:08.005 --> 1:41:09.588
Then it already happened.

1:41:11.672 --> 1:41:13.755
Time travel is a one-way trip.

1:41:15.713 --> 1:41:18.630
I can't go back
until my mission's complete.

1:41:20.588 --> 1:41:24.255
If it begins with you warning me
here in this beach...

1:41:26.213 --> 1:41:28.213
then it always ends with me dying.

1:41:31.005 --> 1:41:32.005
No.

1:41:47.755 --> 1:41:48.755
Go home.

1:41:52.005 --> 1:41:53.213
Take care of mom.

1:41:56.880 --> 1:41:58.172
Take care of me.

1:42:01.713 --> 1:42:02.713
I'm sorry.

1:42:03.130 --> 1:42:04.463
I'll see you soon.

1:42:11.422 --> 1:42:13.172
- I'm sorry.
- I have to go.

1:42:13.255 --> 1:42:15.338
- I'm sorry.
- I have to go.

1:42:49.463 --> 1:42:51.963
<i>Welcome to Rao Technology.</i>

<i>When I was nine...</i>

1:43:05.463 --> 1:43:08.963

<i>full of homemade explosives downtown</i>

1:43:12.047 --> 1:43:13.547
<i>and watched it explode.</i>

1:43:13.630 --> 1:43:16.838
<i>- Electromagnetic levels primed.
- Seven, six...</i>

1:43:16.922 --> 1:43:19.880
<i>- Programming destination. 2015.
- Five, four...</i>

1:43:19.963 --> 1:43:22.130
<i>His attack was just the first.</i>

1:43:22.213 --> 1:43:23.213
<i>Two...</i>

1:43:24.630 --> 1:43:27.672
<i>Eleven thousand people died
the first morning.</i>

1:43:28.838 --> 1:43:31.755
<i>Millions more in the Civil War
that followed.</i>

1:43:33.088 --> 1:43:34.713
<i>It fed on anger.</i>

1:43:35.547 --> 1:43:37.713
<i>It spread through fear.</i>

1:43:37.797 --> 1:43:38.922
<i>Initializing.</i>

1:43:39.005 --> 1:43:41.297
<i>It made monsters out of men.</i>

1:43:41.963 --> 1:43:43.922
<i>Until even the ordinary</i>

1:43:44.547 --> 1:43:45.588
<i>were broken...</i>

1:43:46.713 --> 1:43:47.713
<i>one...</i>

1:43:48.922 --> 1:43:49.922
<i>by one.</i>

1:43:54.172 --> 1:43:56.588
<i>The voice that gave birth to a movement...</i>

1:43:58.672 --> 1:44:01.630
<i>turned a small crack
into a great divide.</i>

1:44:03.963 --> 1:44:06.088
<i>It drowned out the best of us.</i>

1:44:07.547 --> 1:44:09.797
<i>And it amplified the worst.</i>

1:44:11.172 --> 1:44:13.422
<i>So we found a way to silence it.</i>

1:44:16.755 --> 1:44:20.172
<i>We found a way to undo the damage.</i>

1:44:20.255 --> 1:44:21.755
<i>Coronal fluid active.</i>

1:44:22.380 --> 1:44:24.088
<i>Timestream online.</i>

<i>To disconnect the dots.</i>

<i>Subject four terminated.</i>

1:44:33.422 --> 1:44:35.922
<i>Subject three terminated.</i>

1:44:39.005 --> 1:44:40.463
<i>Subject two...</i>

1:44:40.547 --> 1:44:43.672
<i>I volunteered to untell the story.</i>

1:44:46.005 --> 1:44:47.422
<i>Subject one...</i>

1:44:47.797 --> 1:44:48.797
<i>terminated.</i>

1:44:49.047 --> 1:44:51.588
<i>I came back to erase an idea.</i>

1:44:53.130 --> 1:44:55.713
<i>Because some thoughts
are meant to be buried.</i>

1:44:56.880 --> 1:44:59.088
<i>Some before they even begin.</i>

1:45:19.880 --> 1:45:22.963
<i>When the war between us all disappears...</i>

1:45:24.755 --> 1:45:26.088
<i>it won't make a sound.</i>

1:45:28.338 --> 1:45:29.880
<i>It won't leave a scar.</i>

1:45:31.630 --> 1:45:34.422
<i>There will be no great tale in your time.</i>

1:45:36.755 --> 1:45:39.130
<i>Just an echo of what might have been.</i>

1:45:57.338 --> 1:45:58.338
<i>But this...</i>

1:45:59.672 --> 1:46:01.672
<i>this is your story.</i>

1:46:04.172 --> 1:46:05.797
<i>And it doesn't end here.</i>

1:46:10.672 --> 1:46:12.630
<i>It's written in sacrifice.</i>

1:46:15.505 --> 1:46:17.213
<i>It's written in forgiveness.</i>

1:46:20.880 --> 1:46:23.255
<i>And it's time to start your next chapter.</i>

1:46:56.713 --> 1:46:58.005
<i>You will love.</i>

1:47:00.588 --> 1:47:01.922
<i>And you will heal.</i>

1:47:10.213 --> 1:47:12.255
<i>You will teach me how to live.</i>

1:47:15.047 --> 1:47:16.922
<i>And you will make me who I am.</i>

1:47:19.838 --> 1:47:20.838
<i>A fighter.</i>

1:47:23.088 --> 1:47:24.213
<i>Just like you.</i>

1:47:27.505 --> 1:47:28.797

It's okay.

It's okay.

1:47:41.755 --> 1:47:43.588
