11:35.825 --> 11:37.740
<i>Easy, cowboys and girls.</i>

11:37.784 --> 11:39.611
If we're gonna make sure
that history stays on track,

11:39.655 --> 11:42.136
he has to die

11:42.179 --> 11:43.528
in the meltdown.

11:43.572 --> 11:44.921
Nate and I
will grab the general.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.444
Spooner, Behrad,

11:46.488 --> 11:48.446
you ready to restore
some destinies?

11:48.490 --> 11:49.752
All over it.

11:49.796 --> 11:51.058
You got it, Cap.

11:51.101 --> 11:52.799
Gary,
you're on cleanup duty.

11:54.409 --> 11:56.454
Hope you brought
your appetite, big guy.

11:56.498 --> 11:58.718
'Cause I plan on making
a big mess!

They know we're still alive,
right?

13:05.654 --> 13:07.047
I think it's best
to just let them

13:07.090 --> 13:08.483
get it out of their systems.

Where do you think
you're going, General?

13:39.122 --> 13:41.429
You got a date with destiny.

13:41.472 --> 13:44.084
Yeah!
Boom!

13:44.127 --> 13:46.651
Captain always has
the best lines.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.392
Call it a tie?

13:48.436 --> 13:50.873
Oh, this game ain't over.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.657
All right, the sooner
we clean up this mess,

13:52.701 --> 13:54.834
the sooner we can find
those Robo-Legends.

13:58.446 --> 14:01.362
Stupid Gary.

14:08.935 --> 14:10.414
Who are you people?

14:10.458 --> 14:11.981
Well, since you're
gonna be dead soon,

14:12.025 --> 14:14.157
I might as well tell you.

14:14.201 --> 14:16.551
We're time-traveling
superheroes.

14:17.552 --> 14:19.075
Oh.

14:19.119 --> 14:20.816
Okay.

14:20.860 --> 14:25.081
Wow, I must do something
terrible in the future.

14:25.125 --> 14:27.127
Is that why I have to die?

14:27.170 --> 14:29.564
Not exactly.

14:29.607 --> 14:31.131
Well, you said "soon."

14:31.174 --> 14:32.828
Surely you have time to explain

14:32.872 --> 14:34.438
why I have to die
if I don't do anything wrong.

14:34.482 --> 14:36.005
It's complicated.

14:36.049 --> 14:38.965
You see, time is like cement.

14:39.008 --> 14:40.836
In what way?

14:40.880 --> 14:43.795
That it is hard and heavy,
or that you cannot stretch it?

14:43.839 --> 14:45.101
Or--
- You're just supposed to die.

14:45.145 --> 14:46.842
It's as simple as that.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.713
And if you don't,
there's no telling

14:48.757 --> 14:50.367
what the effects could be
on history.

14:50.411 --> 14:53.153
You should be flattered.
That means you're important.

14:53.196 --> 14:55.068
Your men, they weren't
important enough to kill,

14:55.111 --> 14:57.418
so we just restored
their destinies.

14:57.461 --> 14:59.811
<i>No, we definitely</i> <i>
killed those men.</i>

14:59.855 --> 15:01.944
What? No.
They didn't die.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.337
Well, not immediately.

15:03.380 --> 15:04.947
But the doses of radiation

15:04.991 --> 15:07.558
that Spooner and Behrad
hit them with work fast.

15:07.602 --> 15:10.126
Dr. Sharpe's
Restoration Devices

15:10.170 --> 15:11.823
irradiated people?

15:11.867 --> 15:13.695
Only the people
who were supposed to get dosed

15:13.738 --> 15:15.001
by the nuclear meltdown.

15:15.044 --> 15:16.263
We matched
the mortality rates

15:22.182 --> 15:24.967

murder people,

15:26.534 --> 15:28.188
give them cancer?

15:28.231 --> 15:31.191

a timequake, General?

15:31.234 --> 15:32.453
A what?

15:32.496 --> 15:35.630
Then clearly,

a lot of red.

16:08.924 --> 16:10.752

evacuation order.

16:12.884 --> 16:14.234
Must be thousands of them.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.732
Zari, scramble the broadcast.

16:37.561 --> 16:39.215
It's too late.

16:39.259 --> 16:41.043
They've already heard the news.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.827
We can't put this genie
back in the bottle.

16:42.871 --> 16:45.047
Gideon,
what was supposed to happen

16:45.091 --> 16:46.353
in the original timeline?

16:46.396 --> 16:47.919
<i>According to my records,</i>

16:47.963 --> 16:49.443
<i>the city of Pripyat</i> <i>
was evacuated</i>

16:49.486 --> 16:52.054
<i>36 hours</i> <i>
after the Chernobyl meltdown.</i>

16:52.098 --> 16:55.101
The Robo-Legends just
gave them a 37-hour head start.

16:55.144 --> 16:57.407
Wait,
if you killed the TV broadcast,

16:57.451 --> 16:59.496
does that mean
you can also hijack it?

16:59.540 --> 17:01.194
There's nothing I can't hack.

17:01.237 --> 17:02.978
Then I think there's a way
to put the genie

17:03.022 --> 17:04.327
back into the bottle.

17:04.371 --> 17:06.068
All right, QB team,
what's the plan?

17:06.112 --> 17:08.331
Come on,
we're on a deadline here.

17:08.375 --> 17:09.767
Fake news broadcast.

17:09.811 --> 17:11.030
We pretend
the first broadcast

17:11.073 --> 17:12.422
was just a false alarm.

17:12.466 --> 17:14.033
Everyone hears it,
heads back home,

17:14.076 --> 17:15.295
the reactor melts down--

17:15.338 --> 17:17.993
Boom.
History's back on track.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.951
Huh?

17:19.995 --> 17:21.823
Okay, that plan doesn't sound
like it involves much shooting.

17:21.866 --> 17:23.303
- Or punching.
- Sounds like something

17:23.346 --> 17:25.087
those other Legends
would come up with.

17:29.744 --> 17:31.441
Gary's right,
but even if we manage

17:31.485 --> 17:34.096
to get ourselves on TV,
no one's gonna listen to us.

17:34.140 --> 17:38.231
They won't be
listening to you.

17:39.754 --> 17:40.798
Boom's in the shot.

17:42.757 --> 17:45.673
You want me to tell them
there is no meltdown?

17:45.716 --> 17:46.674
Why would I that?

17:46.717 --> 17:48.067
Because if you don't,

17:48.110 --> 17:49.590
history's gonna be
jacked, dingus.

17:49.633 --> 17:51.113
Just like your face.

17:53.246 --> 17:54.377
No.

17:54.421 --> 17:56.858
Never.

17:56.901 --> 17:58.294
I won't do it.

18:02.037 --> 18:04.648
Ah, I'm sorry,
I thought you said--

18:04.692 --> 18:07.608
I said I will not lie
to the Soviet people.

18:07.651 --> 18:10.001
Haven't they been
lied to enough?

18:10.045 --> 18:12.395
First, they were told
that Chernobyl plant is safe,

18:12.439 --> 18:14.658
and now you want me
to tell them to return

18:14.702 --> 18:16.443
to a nuclear meltdown--

18:18.097 --> 18:21.274
It's either that
or a Steel Punch.

18:21.317 --> 18:23.972
Compared to radiation poisoning,

18:24.015 --> 18:27.454
that seems like
a good way to die.

18:27.497 --> 18:29.804
Bah!

18:33.329 --> 18:34.678
This guy's good.

18:34.722 --> 18:36.202
So he doesn't care
about himself.

18:36.245 --> 18:39.379
There must be someone
the general cares about.

18:39.422 --> 18:41.424
I'll see what I can find
on his family.

18:41.468 --> 18:45.080
Normally, military records
are sealed, but...

18:46.429 --> 18:48.388
Nice hacking.

18:48.431 --> 18:51.304
Let's see how the general feels
if something bad were to happen

18:51.347 --> 18:55.134
to little Dmitri,
or his sister, Ulyana.

18:56.874 --> 18:59.573
You would threaten
to harm my children?

18:59.616 --> 19:01.618
You people are truly monsters!

19:03.664 --> 19:04.795
They've done nothing!

19:04.839 --> 19:06.319
He's right.

19:06.362 --> 19:08.538
And according to Gideon,
they go on to do nothing.

19:08.582 --> 19:11.280
Which means we can
remove them from the timeline

19:11.324 --> 19:12.847
without consequence!

19:14.849 --> 19:16.198
Where do we find
these rug rats?

19:16.242 --> 19:17.852
All right, whoa, time-out.

19:17.895 --> 19:20.550
Team meeting.

19:23.684 --> 19:25.207
Threatening this guy's
one thing,

19:25.251 --> 19:27.296
but we're not actually
gonna hurt his kids.

19:27.340 --> 19:28.428
Are we?
- Mm...

19:28.471 --> 19:29.864
- Why not?
- Eh...

19:31.387 --> 19:32.736
The aberration's
getting bigger.

19:32.780 --> 19:34.085
There's red
all over the place.

19:34.129 --> 19:35.609
Red ain't good.

19:35.652 --> 19:37.393
Hey, we are supposed
to be the good guys.

19:37.437 --> 19:39.352
And I know our job
is to protect history, but--

19:41.876 --> 19:43.530
Gary, put him down!

19:43.573 --> 19:45.227
You just ate, like,
five minutes ago.

19:45.271 --> 19:47.490
I told you
you can eat him after he wraps.

19:50.406 --> 19:51.842
Sara.

19:52.930 --> 19:54.236
What have I done?

19:55.629 --> 19:57.196
I'll avenge you, Captain.

19:57.239 --> 19:58.545
Will you just knock it off?

19:58.588 --> 19:59.937
Sometimes, I forget
how fragile

19:59.981 --> 20:01.374
you non-steel humans are.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.114
Would you all
just get it together?

20:03.158 --> 20:05.029
All right? I'm fine.

20:05.073 --> 20:07.380
Actually, you're not fine.
Your blood pressure's dropping.

20:07.423 --> 20:09.033
- You gotta be kidding me.
- No.

20:09.077 --> 20:10.644
You need to return
to the ship, Captain, now.

20:10.687 --> 20:12.385
I don't like what's going on
with your vitals.

20:12.428 --> 20:13.951
Look, I told you, I'm fine.

20:13.995 --> 20:15.562
We just need to figure out
another way to--

20:15.605 --> 20:19.609
I am ordering you
to the ship, stat.

20:19.653 --> 20:21.045
While Captain Lance
is indisposed,

20:21.089 --> 20:23.570
I'm putting you
in charge, Nate.

20:23.613 --> 20:25.093
Don't worry, Captain.

20:25.136 --> 20:27.313
I got it.

20:27.356 --> 20:30.359
That's what I'm afraid of.
