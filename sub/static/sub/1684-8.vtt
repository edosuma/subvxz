WEBVTT

00:00.706 --> 00:02.741
Love is born out of mutual acceptance.

00:02.742 --> 00:06.411
It is commitment and it is sacrifice.

00:06.412 --> 00:08.747
Without utter resolve

00:08.748 --> 00:10.648
and hard-won purpose,

00:10.649 --> 00:12.717
there can be no love.

00:12.718 --> 00:14.686
How can you speak thusly?

00:14.687 --> 00:17.789
Love is neither a duty nor a burden.

00:17.790 --> 00:20.225
Love is a gift.

00:20.226 --> 00:23.027
Can you deny that given
what we are witnessing?

00:23.028 --> 00:25.630
Courtney...

00:25.631 --> 00:27.365
will you accept this heart?

00:27.366 --> 00:29.734
Absolutely.

00:33.939 --> 00:36.441
Don't you see? Marco has clearly

00:36.442 --> 00:38.443
chosen Courtney as his favorite.

00:38.444 --> 00:40.478
Their romance is meant to be.

00:40.479 --> 00:42.247
Roma... This is not romance.

00:42.248 --> 00:44.883
This is shameless groundling Kabuki.

00:44.884 --> 00:47.218
These people would not know
true love if the Bard himself

00:47.219 --> 00:49.187
wrote them a sonnet.

00:50.823 --> 00:53.191
And clearly Amber's his favorite.

00:53.192 --> 00:57.195
For too long, I thought we would
never find a moment's peace.

00:58.364 --> 01:00.265
Can this truly be?

01:00.266 --> 01:04.269
Nearly losing you to Moloch was...

01:04.269 --> 01:06.738
very real.

01:06.739 --> 01:08.606
And now our reunion

01:08.607 --> 01:12.210
is a reality of such exquisite beauty.

01:14.313 --> 01:15.814
Ichabod, you said that

01:15.815 --> 01:18.616
the secrets I've kept from you are bygones.

01:18.617 --> 01:21.653
But I know trust can be hard

01:21.654 --> 01:23.888
to rebuild once it's broken.

01:25.324 --> 01:28.793
In truth...

01:28.794 --> 01:32.346
it pained me to think
you were not who I knew.

01:32.347 --> 01:34.499
Who I was never changed.

01:34.500 --> 01:37.163
The things that I kept from you

01:37.164 --> 01:38.457
were things that I had done.

01:38.458 --> 01:40.146
As a witch. As a spy.

01:40.147 --> 01:41.840
Roles I undertook during the war...

01:41.841 --> 01:44.542
Nevertheless, they are part of who you are.

01:44.543 --> 01:46.544
And secrecy

01:46.545 --> 01:48.246
is a hard habit to break.

01:50.349 --> 01:52.450
As I learned to my regret.

01:52.451 --> 01:56.020
I am sorry

01:56.021 --> 02:00.425
and I pray that you can
learn to trust me again.

02:00.426 --> 02:02.927
We need each other...

02:02.928 --> 02:05.964
as husband and wife...

02:05.965 --> 02:07.966
and to win this war.

02:15.107 --> 02:17.275
Crane!

02:17.276 --> 02:18.543
Crane.

02:18.544 --> 02:20.850
So I put a trace

02:20.851 --> 02:22.752
on Henry's computer
activity, since it's been

02:22.753 --> 02:24.353
almost a week and we
haven't heard from him.

02:24.354 --> 02:26.555
Turns out...

02:27.758 --> 02:29.258
This a bad time?

02:29.259 --> 02:30.793
No, not at all.

02:30.794 --> 02:33.796
In fact, your arrival is a blessed relief

02:33.797 --> 02:35.898
from this mawkish display.

02:35.899 --> 02:38.634
Oh, don't listen to him.
Tell me, Miss Mills, is there

02:38.635 --> 02:42.338
more television of reality
than this one program?

02:43.807 --> 02:45.341
Uh, as much as I would love

02:45.342 --> 02:47.076
to introduce you to the joys

02:47.077 --> 02:49.512
of Housewives and, uh, Duck Dynasties,

02:49.513 --> 02:51.180
we got work to do.

02:51.181 --> 02:53.249
Henry's still out there.

02:53.250 --> 02:54.750
And now that we've bloodied his nose,

02:54.751 --> 02:57.019
he'll be more dangerous than ever.

Licentia mihi vox,

03:29.219 --> 03:31.487
quod operor meus

03:31.488 --> 03:33.522
bidding huic vultus.

03:33.523 --> 03:36.158
Quid me nutrit

03:36.159 --> 03:38.194
me destruit...

03:38.195 --> 03:40.496
me destruit.

03:46.203 --> 03:48.537
Welcome, my dear.

03:48.538 --> 03:50.639
We have much to do.

03:56.913 --> 03:58.781
All right, all right, all right. Let's go.

03:58.782 --> 04:00.983
Shots up, shot up. Uno,

04:00.984 --> 04:04.086
dos, tres.

04:07.758 --> 04:11.594
♪ I'm falling to pieces ♪

04:11.595 --> 04:14.196
♪ But I need this, yeah, I need this ♪

04:14.197 --> 04:16.265
Oh, my gosh, I love this song.

04:16.266 --> 04:17.700
Who is this again?

04:17.701 --> 04:20.101
♪ You're my fault, my weakness ♪

04:20.103 --> 04:23.372
♪ When did you turn so cold? ♪

04:23.373 --> 04:24.807
Just talk to her, man.

04:24.808 --> 04:27.376
What's the worst that can happen?

04:27.377 --> 04:29.145
♪ Now you're dancing all... ♪

04:33.817 --> 04:35.251
You mind?

04:39.956 --> 04:41.557
Mmm.

04:41.558 --> 04:44.660
I needed that.

04:44.661 --> 04:46.696
You ever get that feeling?

04:46.697 --> 04:48.297
Like you need something

04:48.298 --> 04:50.433
but you just can't have it?

04:52.336 --> 04:55.671
And it's not even a need.

04:55.672 --> 04:58.341
It's more like...

04:58.342 --> 05:00.976
like a... a hunger.

05:00.977 --> 05:03.546
And if you don't satisfy it,

05:03.547 --> 05:05.247
you'll die.

05:06.817 --> 05:08.250
Want to dance?

05:15.759 --> 05:18.093
I don't even know your name.

05:41.718 --> 05:45.236
Local nightclub... can
be a bit of a meat market.

05:45.237 --> 05:47.338
For the most part,
it's on the up-and-up.

05:47.339 --> 05:49.273
Let me start over. A nightclub

05:49.274 --> 05:51.709
- is pretty self-explanatory...
- Oh, please, Lieutenant,

05:51.710 --> 05:54.478
private dancing societies...
provocative though they were...

05:54.479 --> 05:55.913
were abundant in my era.

05:55.914 --> 05:57.983
Truth be told, Katrina and I

05:57.984 --> 06:00.319
were known fixtures at
a local establishment.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.488
Crane, you like to dance?

06:02.489 --> 06:05.758
Wouldn't you like to see?

06:05.759 --> 06:07.193
Gavotte.

06:07.194 --> 06:09.328
Allemande.

06:09.329 --> 06:11.330
Even the Viennese waltz.

06:11.331 --> 06:13.599
Thank you.

06:24.544 --> 06:26.879
This is supernatural.

06:26.880 --> 06:30.082
I'll put my money on Henry being behind it.

06:30.083 --> 06:32.618
A wager I would not bet against.

06:32.619 --> 06:34.887
And you still think there's
some good left in him?

06:36.223 --> 06:39.058
Maybe, somewhere deep down, there is.

06:39.059 --> 06:41.894
But at what point do you say that

06:41.895 --> 06:43.662
that no longer matters?

06:43.663 --> 06:47.099
You, of all people, should
know that faith can be rewarded.

06:47.100 --> 06:49.301
I thought it impossible
that Katrina would ever be

06:49.302 --> 06:51.337
returned to me, and she was.

06:51.338 --> 06:53.839
And so were you.

06:56.142 --> 06:59.111
I must give my son the same chance.

07:05.785 --> 07:08.454
- Calm yourself.
- She was promised to me.

07:08.455 --> 07:10.489
Her place is here, by my side.

07:10.490 --> 07:12.958
Only if it suits our master's purpose.

07:12.959 --> 07:14.916
Katrina's affections were
turning... she was starting

07:14.917 --> 07:16.061
to see the truth.

07:16.062 --> 07:18.330
You're not to go after her.

07:18.331 --> 07:20.599
It's Moloch's command.

07:23.103 --> 07:25.104
We have a new plan.

07:50.530 --> 07:52.264
You've done well.

07:53.967 --> 07:56.468
But our lord needs more sustenance.

Sync and corrections by awaqeded

08:43.909 --> 08:46.135
There are dozens of creatures

08:46.136 --> 08:48.404
who leave behind their
victims in such a state.

08:48.405 --> 08:50.784
Nothing is showing up in
recent incident reports

08:50.785 --> 08:51.774
from surrounding areas.

08:51.775 --> 08:53.443
Crane, can you check the thing in the...

08:53.444 --> 08:55.778
Indeed, I'm doing so.

08:55.779 --> 08:57.914
What are these?

08:57.915 --> 09:00.083
Uh...

09:00.084 --> 09:02.418
might be a tattoo. Or a piercing.

09:02.419 --> 09:04.203
Except that these marks align precisely

09:04.204 --> 09:05.271
with a vitae vis point.

09:05.272 --> 09:07.223
- Vitae...
- Vitae vis.

09:07.224 --> 09:08.691
A life force.

09:08.692 --> 09:10.593
There are certain points in the body

09:10.594 --> 09:12.795
through which a person's life force flows.

09:12.796 --> 09:14.897
This is a major artery.

09:14.898 --> 09:17.266
There are certain creatures
that can be identified

09:17.267 --> 09:19.102
by the vitae vis point they target.

09:19.103 --> 09:21.571
Perhaps that would help
you narrow your search.

09:22.639 --> 09:25.241
Brilliant.

09:37.054 --> 09:38.454
Katrina?

09:38.455 --> 09:39.789
I am fine.

09:39.790 --> 09:41.257
It-it's nothing.

09:41.258 --> 09:42.458
Oh, no...

09:42.459 --> 09:44.260
Oh, what a fool I've been.

09:44.261 --> 09:45.995
Pushing you before you're fully recovered.

09:45.996 --> 09:47.864
It's nothing.

09:47.865 --> 09:49.465
Uh, can I get you something? An aspirin?

09:49.466 --> 09:50.867
Indeed.

09:50.868 --> 09:52.602
The modern world has many

09:52.603 --> 09:54.170
remarkable tonics and restoratives,

09:54.171 --> 09:55.872
some of which are chewable.

09:55.873 --> 09:57.262
No, thank you.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.166
Would you, perchance, have some quince tea?

09:59.167 --> 10:00.143
Um...

10:00.144 --> 10:01.444
that hasn't caught on yet.

10:01.445 --> 10:02.778
It's just...

10:02.779 --> 10:04.847
well, Abraham brought me some

10:04.848 --> 10:07.049
when I was ailing. It soothed my nerves.

10:08.318 --> 10:10.720
Truly, I... I am fine.

10:10.721 --> 10:14.323
Hey. I can pick up some tea,
after I get some take-out.

10:14.324 --> 10:16.206
I'm getting hungry; we
got a lot of work to do.

10:16.207 --> 10:17.793
So, uh, Crane, Szechuan chicken?

10:17.794 --> 10:18.995
It's your favorite.

10:18.996 --> 10:20.663
Uh, no, thank you, Lieutenant.

10:20.664 --> 10:22.565
I shall escort Katrina

10:22.566 --> 10:24.100
back to the cabin so she may rest.

10:24.101 --> 10:26.702
Okay. I'll go through these leads.

10:26.703 --> 10:28.704
In the morning, we can, uh, check them...

10:28.705 --> 10:31.340
check them out.

10:41.051 --> 10:44.053
Hey, babe, get me some fries with...

10:44.054 --> 10:46.656
With melted cheese. I know.

10:49.593 --> 10:52.328
For a vegan, she eats a lot of crap.

10:52.329 --> 10:54.497
Well, as long as no animals were harmed

10:54.498 --> 10:56.732
in the making of that cheese-like topping.

10:59.603 --> 11:01.771
Hey, um,

11:01.772 --> 11:03.940
I wanted to talk to you about something,

11:03.941 --> 11:06.542
'cause I don't want there to be
any mixed signals or anything,

11:06.543 --> 11:09.278
- but...
- What are you talking about?

11:09.279 --> 11:11.214
You hang out with me all the time.

11:11.215 --> 11:13.849
And, well,

11:13.850 --> 11:15.084
I'm with Melissa.

11:15.085 --> 11:17.853
You've got it all wrong.

11:17.854 --> 11:20.056
I've got to go.

11:20.057 --> 11:23.326
Becky.

11:30.500 --> 11:32.602
Guys always think everything's

11:32.603 --> 11:33.803
- about them.
- Melissa?

11:33.804 --> 11:36.005
Who-who are you?

11:36.006 --> 11:37.807
It makes them blind.

11:37.808 --> 11:39.909
It makes them think
they're the ones we want.

11:39.910 --> 11:42.612
But it's not him you want, is it?

11:42.613 --> 11:46.349
But women?

11:46.350 --> 11:48.618
Women always know.

11:48.619 --> 11:50.319
They know what's in your heart,

11:50.320 --> 11:52.321
what you really want.

11:52.322 --> 11:54.156
So...

11:54.157 --> 11:56.359
beautiful.

12:08.939 --> 12:12.208
Becky, you out here? Becky.

12:19.783 --> 12:21.117
Crane.

12:21.118 --> 12:22.351
Lieutenant.

12:22.352 --> 12:23.452
Got another victim.

12:23.453 --> 12:25.288
A diner downtown, an hour ago.

12:25.289 --> 12:27.790
Whatever's doing this is working overtime.

12:27.791 --> 12:30.693
Katrina suggested that,
as well as creatures,

12:30.694 --> 12:32.962
we consider mystical artifacts.

12:32.963 --> 12:35.898
I've been reviewing

12:35.899 --> 12:38.734
those catalogued in Benjamin
Franklin's sketchbook,

12:38.735 --> 12:42.805
and several of them seem to be quite lethal

12:42.806 --> 12:46.075
and unaccounted for.

12:46.076 --> 12:49.011
We need to consult an expert.

12:53.050 --> 12:54.717
Hey.

12:54.718 --> 12:56.986
Mmm. I started without you.

12:56.987 --> 12:58.554
What's your poison?

12:58.555 --> 13:00.323
This isn't a date.

13:00.324 --> 13:02.425
Well, late night call from
a girl plus drinks at bar

13:02.426 --> 13:03.693
equals date.

13:03.694 --> 13:06.295
Sorry you got your signals crossed,

13:06.296 --> 13:08.698
but I'm sure you've misread women before.

13:08.699 --> 13:10.833
Doubtful.

13:12.135 --> 13:15.137
Two unnatural corpses popped up in town

13:15.138 --> 13:17.673
in a span of hours. You have any idea

13:17.674 --> 13:20.042
- what could have caused this?
- No. No, thanks.

13:20.043 --> 13:21.243
Last time I donated my services,

13:21.244 --> 13:23.212
I nearly got mauled by a wendigo.

13:23.213 --> 13:25.081
- Hawley...
- Okay, maybe not mauled but...

13:25.082 --> 13:26.515
claws and teeth were involved.

13:26.516 --> 13:28.417
Hawley, just take a look.

13:28.418 --> 13:31.654
The sheriff's department
would consider it a favor.

13:31.655 --> 13:34.256
So you asking me as a cop or...

13:34.257 --> 13:36.025
is this a personal request?

13:36.026 --> 13:39.929
Which one will get me to yes?

13:41.798 --> 13:43.833
Hmm.

13:45.602 --> 13:48.270
Never seen anything like this.

13:48.271 --> 13:50.973
Definitely nothing that's
ever been in my inventory.

13:50.974 --> 13:52.708
I'm sorry.

13:55.112 --> 13:58.380
Now, about that drink.

14:00.884 --> 14:02.351
Um...

14:02.352 --> 14:04.987
mm, sorry to disappoint you.

14:07.391 --> 14:10.526
Kind of getting used to it.

14:15.265 --> 14:16.599
Well...

14:16.600 --> 14:19.101
Mills, if you'll excuse me,

14:19.102 --> 14:22.071
I may be able to salvage
this night after all.

14:25.809 --> 14:27.443
Hey, there.

14:27.444 --> 14:28.711
I'm Hawley.

14:28.712 --> 14:31.080
What are you guys doing later on?

14:31.081 --> 14:33.916
Hawley was a dead end.

14:33.917 --> 14:35.151
Not surprising.

14:35.152 --> 14:37.119
After all, Mr. Hawley's allegiance

14:37.120 --> 14:38.487
seems only to be to himself.

14:38.488 --> 14:40.389
And the occasional meaningless bar hookup.

14:40.390 --> 14:43.092
He found some, uh, distractions

14:43.093 --> 14:44.827
of the female variety.

14:44.828 --> 14:46.562
I see.

14:46.563 --> 14:48.464
A Banbury story.

14:48.465 --> 14:50.366
A vow made in the heat of the moment

14:50.367 --> 14:53.002
that one never intends to keep.

14:53.003 --> 14:54.003
Guys will be guys.

14:58.275 --> 14:59.708
Crane...

15:00.744 --> 15:01.810
The first victim was found

15:01.811 --> 15:03.312
in the back seat of his own car.

15:03.313 --> 15:05.147
Who gets in the back seat of their own car?

15:05.148 --> 15:08.550
Someone who thinks they're gonna get lucky.

15:08.551 --> 15:12.654
Um... get lucky, score, get... get some.

15:12.655 --> 15:15.157
Ah. Macking.

15:15.158 --> 15:17.693
He was macking on a lady.

15:17.694 --> 15:20.395
Amber said the same thing about Marco.

15:20.396 --> 15:22.297
So he was with a woman.

15:22.298 --> 15:24.700
Of course. Why did I not see it sooner?

15:24.701 --> 15:25.634
The signs are classic.

15:25.635 --> 15:26.868
Katrina?

15:26.869 --> 15:28.270
Those poor souls

15:28.271 --> 15:30.136
were targeted for their vitae vis.

15:30.137 --> 15:31.573
As you determined,

15:31.574 --> 15:34.007
they were attacked by a
woman or something that looked

15:34.008 --> 15:36.341
- like a woman.
- A succubus.

15:36.342 --> 15:37.576
It's a creature

15:37.577 --> 15:39.578
that, uh, seduces its victims

15:39.579 --> 15:41.246
and then feeds off of its life force.

15:43.416 --> 15:44.750
Listed in the library.

15:44.751 --> 15:45.784
Well, they can see

15:45.785 --> 15:47.119
into your heart.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.353
They are drawn to desire

15:48.354 --> 15:50.088
the way moths are drawn to a flame.

15:50.089 --> 15:52.090
The more secret the desire,

15:52.091 --> 15:53.692
the stronger the pull of the succubus.

15:53.693 --> 15:56.295
Secret desires burn brightest.

15:56.296 --> 15:59.498
From the lady in the black jacket.

16:01.468 --> 16:03.068
Yeah, tell her thanks,

16:03.069 --> 16:04.841
but I don't think I'd be very good company.

16:04.842 --> 16:06.303
I'll be the judge of that.

16:06.304 --> 16:08.638
A succubus can look into your heart

16:08.639 --> 16:11.608
and mimic the objects of
desire they find there.

16:11.609 --> 16:15.512
Geez, first time a
girl's bought you a drink?

16:15.513 --> 16:16.946
Nah.

16:16.947 --> 16:19.649
Then again, maybe I shouldn't be surprised.

16:27.859 --> 16:30.093
And now that I know the
type of demon we seek,

16:30.094 --> 16:31.495
I might be able to track

16:31.496 --> 16:33.196
its mystical energy.

16:34.199 --> 16:35.766
Do you have a map?

16:35.767 --> 16:37.200
- Um...
- Uh, yes.

17:01.226 --> 17:03.827
That is the harbor.

17:03.828 --> 17:05.829
- There's nothing there but water.
- No.

17:07.065 --> 17:09.165
I know that location.

17:12.337 --> 17:15.271
My boat's just, uh, down at the end.

17:15.272 --> 17:17.507
Hope you're a better sailor than a drinker.

17:35.771 --> 17:37.238
Hawley!

17:38.807 --> 17:40.241
Lieutenant!

18:20.749 --> 18:22.308
What the hell was that?

18:22.309 --> 18:24.043
A succubus.

18:25.145 --> 18:26.698
She killed those other people.

18:26.759 --> 18:29.080
You are fortunate to
have survived that attack.

18:29.081 --> 18:31.249
Fortunate, my ass.

18:33.119 --> 18:34.486
Maelstrom crystal.

18:34.487 --> 18:35.920
Distilled

18:35.921 --> 18:37.956
from the blood of an Arabian ifrit.

18:37.957 --> 18:41.426
Gives off a nasty mystical jolt.

18:43.596 --> 18:45.130
Succubus, huh?

18:45.131 --> 18:46.598
Well, that settles it.

18:46.599 --> 18:48.166
I'm definitely not buying her breakfast.

18:48.167 --> 18:51.002
I'm gonna see if Katrina
can give us a bearing

18:51.003 --> 18:52.904
on Miss Love-Em- and-Eat-Em.

18:56.375 --> 18:58.042
- Hey.
- Steady.

18:59.278 --> 19:00.712
Man.

19:00.713 --> 19:02.914
Just can't seem to get
rid of the crazy ones.

19:02.915 --> 19:06.217
The creature is drawn to those

19:06.218 --> 19:08.419
who hide desire in their heart.

19:15.127 --> 19:16.427
Hey, I, no, I'm...

19:16.428 --> 19:17.662
I'm grateful, you know?

19:17.663 --> 19:19.430
She saved my life.

19:19.431 --> 19:21.366
As you did hers.

19:21.367 --> 19:23.301
And now she is no longer in your debt.

19:23.302 --> 19:25.970
Look, not everything's
about a balance sheet, okay?

19:25.971 --> 19:27.705
I know you think that's
all I care about, but...

19:27.706 --> 19:29.474
Katrina's having trouble tracking it.

19:29.475 --> 19:30.942
It must have gone somewhere,

19:30.943 --> 19:32.310
shielded from her magic.

19:33.445 --> 19:35.546
You okay?

19:36.148 --> 19:38.716
Aces.

19:41.954 --> 19:43.481
Oh, and, Hawley...

19:43.482 --> 19:45.290
might be a good idea to stay in tonight.

19:45.291 --> 19:47.659
Read a book.

19:49.662 --> 19:52.397
Henry's moves are very calculated.

19:52.398 --> 19:54.933
First the Jincan, the Wendigo...

19:54.934 --> 19:56.434
He had a purpose for all of them.

19:56.435 --> 19:58.102
Why would he release a succubus?

19:58.103 --> 20:00.939
I see no pattern yet, either.

20:00.940 --> 20:02.574
Then again, I have been somewhat

20:02.575 --> 20:04.375
distracted of late.

20:04.376 --> 20:05.510
Katrina.

20:05.511 --> 20:08.346
So much has transpired for us both.

20:10.115 --> 20:11.883
We're not the people we once were.

20:11.884 --> 20:13.384
Crane, people change,

20:13.385 --> 20:15.520
especially during a war.

20:15.521 --> 20:18.456
They grow and evolve.

20:18.457 --> 20:19.924
It's just that your relationship

20:19.925 --> 20:21.459
has to evolve, as well.

20:24.830 --> 20:28.700
As must, I suspect, my
opinion of Mr. Hawley.

20:30.135 --> 20:32.103
He is a brigand and a mercenary,

20:32.104 --> 20:34.672
but not without his charms.

20:34.673 --> 20:35.974
The hell are you talking about?

20:35.975 --> 20:37.575
All I'm saying is

20:37.576 --> 20:41.145
if he were to explore a social relationship

20:41.146 --> 20:43.581
with... someone,

20:43.582 --> 20:45.950
I... I would certainly not be...

20:45.951 --> 20:47.252
Oh.

20:47.253 --> 20:50.188
Uh, let's say you're onto something.

20:50.189 --> 20:52.023
You, of all people,
know that there's no room

20:52.024 --> 20:53.691
in our lives for complications.

20:53.692 --> 20:56.694
And since when has opening
our hearts to new possibilities

20:56.695 --> 20:58.162
been a complication?

20:59.932 --> 21:03.201
Since always.

21:14.848 --> 21:16.681
It's all right. It's all
right. It's all right.

21:16.682 --> 21:18.182
You were having a nightmare.

21:18.183 --> 21:20.852
- Oh.
- Just a nightmare.

21:20.853 --> 21:22.754
Are you still unwell?

21:22.755 --> 21:24.689
I don't know.

21:24.690 --> 21:26.691
I keep having

21:26.692 --> 21:30.028
these visions of a baby.

21:30.029 --> 21:32.397
Of course.

21:32.398 --> 21:35.667
Your mind is grappling with what you lost.

21:35.668 --> 21:38.136
An unholy creature of purgatory.

21:38.137 --> 21:41.005
Re-Regardless,

21:41.006 --> 21:43.341
it was still living within you.

21:43.342 --> 21:46.077
Connected to you.

21:46.078 --> 21:48.746
I know what you speak of.

21:48.747 --> 21:53.418
It's been said mothers can feel
an absence after having a baby.

21:53.419 --> 21:55.386
A sense of intense loss. I know...

21:55.387 --> 21:56.888
But this is different.

21:56.889 --> 21:59.958
It defies logic, but it is as if

21:59.959 --> 22:03.795
a part of me is elsewhere,
and it won't let go.

22:03.796 --> 22:05.897
So,

22:05.898 --> 22:08.299
according to everything that
I have been able to find,

22:08.300 --> 22:11.336
succubi usually attack
at monthly intervals.

22:11.337 --> 22:14.038
The life force that they
drain from the victims

22:14.039 --> 22:15.506
last them for weeks.

22:15.507 --> 22:16.808
But she killed twice

22:16.809 --> 22:18.743
and attacked a third in one night.

22:18.744 --> 22:20.979
Right.

22:20.980 --> 22:23.648
Why is it feeding so much?

22:30.556 --> 22:32.190
Katrina.

22:32.191 --> 22:34.058
Katrina, are you all right?

22:34.059 --> 22:36.961
I saw the child again.

22:36.962 --> 22:41.032
It was with Henry and a... and
a woman, at Fredericks Manor.

22:41.033 --> 22:43.201
Though it does not look like I remember it.

22:43.202 --> 22:44.635
How do you mean?

22:44.636 --> 22:48.206
Oh, there were... vines everywhere.

22:49.742 --> 22:52.477
That's not a memory. That's how it is now.

22:52.478 --> 22:55.813
Somehow you're seeing inside there.

22:55.814 --> 23:01.486
Katrina, do you think you
can focus these visions?

23:31.884 --> 23:33.217
No, it cannot be.

23:33.218 --> 23:34.952
But what? What is it?

23:34.953 --> 23:37.088
The succubus... she's not feeding herself.

23:37.089 --> 23:40.158
The energy she's collecting...
she's using it to nurture

23:40.159 --> 23:41.826
this... this creature.

23:41.827 --> 23:44.429
What creature?

23:44.430 --> 23:48.266
The creature that was inside of me.

23:53.705 --> 23:55.440
Moloch.

23:59.957 --> 24:02.887
- Moloch is alive.
- And here in our world.

24:02.888 --> 24:04.099
How can this be?

24:04.100 --> 24:06.232
We thought we stopped
him with the Aurora Prism.

24:12.030 --> 24:14.231
He must have just shunted
his energy somewhere.

24:14.232 --> 24:16.333
I am still psychically linked.

24:16.334 --> 24:18.035
I can see what it sees.

24:18.036 --> 24:20.170
Henry must have summoned the succubus

24:20.171 --> 24:23.407
to complete the process
that began inside Katrina.

24:23.408 --> 24:25.109
I told you he wasn't done yet.

24:25.110 --> 24:26.777
And he won't be done

24:26.778 --> 24:28.245
until everyone is dead,

24:28.246 --> 24:30.114
and the world is in flames.

24:30.115 --> 24:31.615
Henry is under Moloch's sway.

24:31.616 --> 24:33.917
Uh. This again.

24:33.918 --> 24:37.187
If we can sever Henry's ties to the demon,

24:37.188 --> 24:38.555
we will see that the soul

24:38.556 --> 24:40.293
of my son is still alive inside of him.

24:40.294 --> 24:42.359
But how are we supposed
to do that? Besides,

24:42.360 --> 24:44.395
who knows if there's a soul still in there?

24:44.396 --> 24:46.563
It is what I believe,
and it is what matters,

24:46.564 --> 24:48.098
because he is our son.

24:48.099 --> 24:50.501
And he is my problem,
because I am a Witness,

24:50.502 --> 24:52.636
and he is one of the
Horseman of the Apocalypse,

24:52.637 --> 24:55.668
something we have been fighting
long before you got here.

24:55.669 --> 24:57.556
What do you know about how
long I've been fight...?

24:57.557 --> 25:00.210
Stop this! Now! Both of you!

25:00.211 --> 25:04.848
Do you not you see, we are
what the enemy fears the most?

25:04.849 --> 25:07.384
The two Witnesses united,

25:07.385 --> 25:10.187
and allied with a powerful witch.

25:10.188 --> 25:11.622
Working together,

25:11.623 --> 25:14.091
we are more formidable
than we have ever been.

25:14.092 --> 25:18.095
And we cannot jeopardize that,

25:18.096 --> 25:20.386
not with this much at stake.

25:20.387 --> 25:24.167
Not with everything that
still must be done. Please.

25:29.145 --> 25:31.480
Well...

25:31.481 --> 25:36.017
there are some mystical
texts I can consult.

25:39.055 --> 25:41.656
Some files I can go through.

25:49.933 --> 25:51.726
Hang on. I got a hit.

25:51.727 --> 25:53.624
Here is the creature we encountered.

25:53.625 --> 25:55.626
They call it the Incordata.

25:55.627 --> 25:56.661
The Heartless.

25:56.662 --> 25:58.129
Feels no desire of its own,

25:58.130 --> 26:00.798
so it hunts and consumes
the desires of others.

26:00.799 --> 26:02.633
Incordata.

26:02.634 --> 26:04.836
Incordata.

26:04.837 --> 26:08.406
Ah, there is another reason for its name.

26:08.407 --> 26:12.443
It literally has no heart.

26:12.444 --> 26:15.980
The organ is stored
apart from its body. Ah.

26:15.981 --> 26:17.482
"To destroy the creature,

26:17.483 --> 26:20.451
"one must first find
and extinguish its heart.

26:20.452 --> 26:23.454
"Only then can the body be killed.

26:23.455 --> 26:25.690
"In the third century,

26:25.691 --> 26:28.960
"a Roman priest defeated
the first of the Heartless.

26:28.961 --> 26:31.529
"Afterwards, he gave the
remains of the succubus's heart

26:31.530 --> 26:35.633
"to the Emperor Claudius, who
immortalized the priest as...

26:35.634 --> 26:37.668
Saint Valentine."

26:37.669 --> 26:41.639
Hence the custom of giving
hearts on Valentine's Day.

26:41.640 --> 26:43.708
Now single people everywhere
have to drown their sorrows

26:43.709 --> 26:45.510
in tubs of Rocky Road.

26:45.511 --> 26:49.146
So, we must find a succubus' heart.

26:49.147 --> 26:51.249
It would have to be on consecrated ground.

26:51.250 --> 26:55.753
- Like a church or...
- Or a cemetery.

26:55.754 --> 26:58.789
Remember the trace I put
on Henry's online activity?

26:58.790 --> 27:01.659
A few days ago, he applied for a permit.

27:01.660 --> 27:04.462
Gives him access to the
grounds at Shady Hills Cemetery.

27:04.463 --> 27:07.164
It's a pretty good place for hiding stuff,

27:07.165 --> 27:09.500
especially the vital organ of a demon.

27:09.501 --> 27:11.035
Once we find the heart,

27:11.036 --> 27:13.905
an immolation spell will destroy it.

27:13.906 --> 27:16.040
Leaving the body vulnerable.

27:16.041 --> 27:19.343
Lieutenant, you must go
with Katrina and protect her.

27:19.344 --> 27:21.512
In the meanwhile,

27:21.513 --> 27:24.382
I will track a succubus
and be prepared to strike.

27:24.383 --> 27:27.018
Except you have no idea what
she looks like in human form.

27:28.420 --> 27:31.055
But we know someone who does.

27:36.028 --> 27:39.997
So, I help you find this
thing, I get a lock of her hair.

27:41.366 --> 27:43.267
Understood.

27:43.268 --> 27:46.971
Once we locate her, we
must keep our distance

27:46.972 --> 27:48.573
until my wife and the lieutenant tell us

27:48.574 --> 27:51.142
that they have destroyed her heart.

27:51.143 --> 27:53.834
We do not engage until then, is that clear?

27:53.835 --> 27:55.435
As vodka.

27:55.436 --> 27:59.039
You think she's gonna
be here at Club Twerk?

27:59.040 --> 28:00.617
According to our research,

28:00.618 --> 28:02.819
the succubus' feeding pattern is circular.

28:02.820 --> 28:06.256
She will likely return to the
location of a successful kill.

28:06.257 --> 28:09.359
Makes sense if she's drawn by desire.

28:09.360 --> 28:13.697
This is what we call a
target-rich environment.

28:13.698 --> 28:18.935
God, is this music or
attacking the walls of Jericho?

28:28.346 --> 28:29.813
Mr. Hawley,

28:29.814 --> 28:32.749
what are your intentions
towards Lieutenant Mills?

28:32.750 --> 28:34.851
Excuse me?

28:34.852 --> 28:36.887
The one thing you have in your favor is

28:36.888 --> 28:38.355
you are a man of your word.

28:38.356 --> 28:40.090
So, it would mean something

28:40.091 --> 28:43.293
if you were to tell me that
your intentions are honorable.

28:43.294 --> 28:45.228
I don't know what you're talking about,

28:45.229 --> 28:46.930
but, whatever it is,

28:46.931 --> 28:49.666
I'm pretty damn certain
it's none of your business.

28:54.038 --> 28:55.805
Hey, j-just to be clear...

28:56.908 --> 28:58.608
...she ask about me, or...?

28:59.377 --> 29:01.011
Crane.

29:26.740 --> 29:28.127
What are we looking for?

29:28.128 --> 29:30.229
Henry would have cast an obscuring spell

29:30.230 --> 29:32.198
to prevent the heart from being detected.

29:32.199 --> 29:34.434
Could be in the form of hex symbols,

29:34.435 --> 29:37.236
or possibly some kind of mystical shrine.

29:41.909 --> 29:44.510
Abigail, I know you think
I've been irrational.

29:45.412 --> 29:46.846
Willfully blind even.

29:46.847 --> 29:48.448
Condescending.

29:51.251 --> 29:54.120
It's just that so much of what I
thought I knew is slipping away.

29:54.121 --> 29:57.657
And so I hold on to that in
my heart I feel to be true.

29:57.658 --> 29:59.792
Is that so wrong?

29:59.793 --> 30:04.330
Being able to call someone
"family" isn't just biology.

30:04.331 --> 30:06.010
It has to be earned.

30:06.011 --> 30:07.445
You don't think Henry has earned my love?

30:07.446 --> 30:10.370
I think that there are things that
even a mother's love can't overcome.

30:10.371 --> 30:12.538
My mother loved me and Jenny,

30:12.539 --> 30:14.641
but...

30:14.642 --> 30:16.642
in the end it wasn't enough.

30:20.681 --> 30:22.213
Hey.

30:23.235 --> 30:24.502
Check that out.

30:25.637 --> 30:27.405
A protective hex.

30:30.542 --> 30:32.043
Let's see what it's protecting.

30:37.883 --> 30:40.585
Are the incessantly flashing
lights why no one seems able

30:40.586 --> 30:42.253
to find their dance partner?

30:43.789 --> 30:47.425
It would help if you could
describe her appearance.

30:47.426 --> 30:51.662
She's about, I don't know,
this tall, with dark hair...

30:51.663 --> 30:53.898
I think...

30:53.899 --> 30:56.234
God, it's like she's
not really in my memory.

30:56.235 --> 31:00.004
I don't know, she's... All
I recall is this feeling.

31:01.774 --> 31:03.508
A feeling...

31:09.114 --> 31:10.481
Crane.

31:10.482 --> 31:13.684
Succubus.

31:24.163 --> 31:26.197
We must not lose sight of her.

31:26.198 --> 31:29.333
Okay, I'll check the front,
you circle around back.

31:29.334 --> 31:30.701
Enchanted Nordic blade.

31:30.702 --> 31:32.937
Supposedly good against
all manner of demons.

31:32.938 --> 31:35.072
Then again, never been tested.

31:38.710 --> 31:40.978
Mills, we got a sighting of our demon babe.

31:40.979 --> 31:42.346
You find the heart?

31:42.347 --> 31:44.115
Yeah, I think we're closing in.

31:45.784 --> 31:49.215
I can sense the heart, it is close.

31:49.435 --> 31:50.555
Call you when we're done.

32:36.602 --> 32:38.169
Here.

32:48.780 --> 32:50.514
Ugh.

32:55.787 --> 32:57.788
It's okay, it's cool.

32:57.789 --> 33:00.124
Just tip it over, empty the contents.

33:00.125 --> 33:01.893
Tip it over, they-they'll run everywhere.

33:01.894 --> 33:04.161
What? Maggots can't run.

33:04.162 --> 33:05.530
Maggots?

33:05.531 --> 33:07.398
Are they beneath the rats?

33:08.700 --> 33:11.102
Rats?

33:14.606 --> 33:16.240
We're seeing different things.

33:16.241 --> 33:19.243
Which means it's not real.

33:19.244 --> 33:21.579
Perception spell.

33:21.580 --> 33:24.315
Designed to prey upon individual fears.

33:25.517 --> 33:27.118
So, really there's nothing in there.

33:27.119 --> 33:29.387
Most likely not.

33:46.772 --> 33:48.940
This is nasty.

33:48.941 --> 33:50.508
I'll start the spell.

33:50.509 --> 33:52.743
You were at the docks.

33:54.112 --> 33:56.847
You denied me my satisfaction.

33:56.848 --> 33:58.449
But not this time.

33:58.450 --> 34:02.186
I can sense your desire.

34:02.187 --> 34:06.390
It burns strong, even though
you try so hard to hide it.

34:08.427 --> 34:11.195
And yet...

34:11.196 --> 34:15.699
the emotion in your heart
has soured, hasn't it?

34:17.135 --> 34:19.303
I know that taste.

34:19.304 --> 34:22.206
It's the taste of doubt.

34:32.918 --> 34:34.685
Hawley.

34:34.686 --> 34:35.953
You ready?

34:35.954 --> 34:37.588
- I lost Crane.
- What?

34:37.589 --> 34:40.024
He's got to be in the back.

34:46.898 --> 34:50.368
You don't have to be strong any more.

34:50.369 --> 34:53.437
You don't have to pretend you're not scared

34:53.438 --> 34:55.438
of losing all you love.

34:55.440 --> 34:57.608
Let me take your doubt away.

35:04.783 --> 35:06.751
Katrina!

35:07.819 --> 35:09.420
Katrina.

35:11.590 --> 35:14.024
Katrina.

36:21.233 --> 36:23.568
You're injured.

36:23.569 --> 36:24.769
Yeah.

36:24.770 --> 36:26.237
I'll live.

36:28.807 --> 36:31.242
Well...

36:31.243 --> 36:33.945
you give me a blade and
keep the gun for yourself.

36:33.946 --> 36:37.942
Didn't think you could
handle the firepower, Crane.

36:37.943 --> 36:40.344
Just as well, I could.

36:41.514 --> 36:44.583
You need all the assistance you can get.

36:48.688 --> 36:51.690
Oh, man.

36:53.860 --> 36:56.128
Easy, easy, easy.

36:56.129 --> 36:57.562
You took a pretty big spill.

36:57.563 --> 36:58.812
It's my own fault.

36:58.813 --> 37:00.789
I should have recognized
the protection hex.

37:00.790 --> 37:02.501
Thank you. I'll be fine.

37:02.502 --> 37:04.102
You sure?

37:04.103 --> 37:07.305
Fortunately my head is
almost as hard as Ichabod's.

37:12.278 --> 37:13.779
Crane is right.

37:13.780 --> 37:15.580
We're a lot stronger with you on the team.

37:15.581 --> 37:19.251
It took me a little while
to get used to the idea,

37:19.252 --> 37:20.986
but I can see it now.

37:24.123 --> 37:25.724
We may have destroyed the succubus,

37:25.725 --> 37:28.360
but Henry will devise a new plan.

37:28.361 --> 37:31.129
So you agree Henry must be stopped.

37:31.130 --> 37:34.833
I agree that this evil
has to come to an end.

37:34.834 --> 37:37.169
And for that to happen,

37:37.170 --> 37:38.670
I must destroy Moloch.

37:38.671 --> 37:40.906
Wow.

37:40.907 --> 37:44.176
I can sense his growing power.

37:44.177 --> 37:48.113
But he's still vulnerable. For now.

37:48.114 --> 37:50.081
The Horsemen are guarding him.

37:50.082 --> 37:52.617
I can get close.

37:52.618 --> 37:56.321
Abraham is still in love with me.

37:57.390 --> 37:59.691
I can convince him to take me back.

38:01.060 --> 38:03.895
I will tell him how Ichabod has moved on.

38:05.097 --> 38:08.233
And how he's found his life here,

38:08.234 --> 38:10.001
with you by his side.

38:10.002 --> 38:11.736
And once Abraham

38:11.737 --> 38:14.439
takes me back, I will
gain access to Moloch.

38:14.440 --> 38:16.141
And I will strike him dead.

38:16.142 --> 38:18.977
There is no way Crane is
going to agree to this.

38:18.978 --> 38:21.613
Which is why I need you to tell him for me.

38:21.614 --> 38:25.097
I cannot bear to leave him once again.

38:25.098 --> 38:27.385
And he'll understand that coming from you.

38:31.824 --> 38:34.192
You're betting an awful lot
on Abraham's love for you.

38:34.193 --> 38:36.428
And Crane's.

38:37.196 --> 38:39.130
Perhaps.

38:39.131 --> 38:43.101
But I've learned that love
can be a very dangerous weapon.

38:50.577 --> 38:53.224
You should get a doctor to check that out.

38:53.846 --> 38:55.614
What, and put myself in the system?

38:55.615 --> 38:59.217
No thanks. I'll stay off the grid.

39:00.253 --> 39:02.020
Here, let me do it.

39:06.993 --> 39:08.326
Where's Crane?

39:08.327 --> 39:09.928
He's inside.

39:09.929 --> 39:12.964
Looking for balms and salves.

39:12.965 --> 39:17.002
Think there was even
some talk of a poultice.

39:17.003 --> 39:20.805
I heard there wasn't much
left of the Incordata.

39:20.806 --> 39:23.842
- Huh?
- Woman who almost stole your heart.

39:23.843 --> 39:26.678
Figured you might use this.

39:26.679 --> 39:29.648
Oh, you shouldn't have.

39:29.649 --> 39:31.650
Really.

39:31.651 --> 39:33.485
It's what's left of the succubus's heart.

39:33.486 --> 39:34.753
Figured you might know people

39:34.754 --> 39:36.321
who'd pay for something like that.

39:36.322 --> 39:38.223
Yeah. Yeah.

39:38.224 --> 39:41.226
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

39:41.227 --> 39:44.763
It's not every day a girl
just gives me her heart.

39:44.764 --> 39:47.799
Yeah. I have to punch
you in the throat now.

39:49.302 --> 39:50.936
Although there was a veritable

39:50.937 --> 39:53.538
apothecary in the mirrored cabinet,

39:53.539 --> 39:55.540
I could not locate... Oh.

39:55.541 --> 39:57.075
- Lieutenant.
- Hey.

39:59.779 --> 40:01.713
Where's Katrina?

40:01.714 --> 40:03.882
Crane, we have to talk.

40:06.085 --> 40:08.119
She thought you would understand.

40:08.120 --> 40:11.256
It is a bold move. With significant risk.

40:11.257 --> 40:14.559
But if it succeeds,

40:14.560 --> 40:17.395
we will have struck a decisive blow.

40:17.396 --> 40:20.598
So you're cool with
Katrina making this call?

40:22.268 --> 40:24.436
You were right, Lieutenant,

40:24.437 --> 40:29.040
when you said we must allow
relationships to evolve.

40:29.041 --> 40:32.143
We must allow them to
follow their natural course,

40:32.144 --> 40:34.179
wherever that may lead.

40:34.180 --> 40:37.816
Katrina is the love of my life.

40:37.817 --> 40:41.653
But she is also a highly skilled operative,

40:41.654 --> 40:45.490
a fact I tend to overlook.

40:49.395 --> 40:51.129
Katrina's heart

40:51.130 --> 40:55.200
has always been deep and mysterious.

40:55.201 --> 40:58.937
A fact she has used to her advantage.

41:06.979 --> 41:08.380
Katrina has returned.

41:08.381 --> 41:10.815
She knows her place now.

41:10.816 --> 41:13.885
As I told you she would.

41:13.886 --> 41:16.321
I know you think she's
playing on my affections,

41:16.322 --> 41:17.789
but I truly believe...

41:17.790 --> 41:20.558
Bring her in.

41:20.559 --> 41:22.761
I'm glad she's finally come around.

41:27.600 --> 41:30.135
Is she still wearing her necklace?

41:31.837 --> 41:33.438
She is.

41:33.439 --> 41:35.707
Good.

41:47.720 --> 41:49.354
It's good to see you, Mother.

41:50.656 --> 41:54.471
I must trust in her skill

41:55.231 --> 41:57.692
and her experience.

42:00.032 --> 42:01.833
But more than that...

42:02.835 --> 42:06.738
I must...

42:06.739 --> 42:08.440
trust...

42:08.441 --> 42:10.542
her.
