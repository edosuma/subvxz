06:53.913 --> 06:55.915
We have a three-year-old daughter.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.550
Her name is Yi-duo Zhao.

06:57.617 --> 06:59.752
She knows how to rock climb too.

07:00.386 --> 07:03.589
-Yi-duo, we'll be the champions!
-Yi-duo, we'll be the champions!

07:24.877 --> 07:25.812
You can do it!

07:25.878 --> 07:28.147
-Go, China!
-Go, China!

08:20.666 --> 08:22.502
Awesome! You're doing great!

08:22.768 --> 08:24.837
She's trying to stay calm and collected.

08:25.605 --> 08:26.739
Take a deep breath.

08:27.073 --> 08:28.508
Next up is the Faceplant.

08:29.408 --> 08:31.244
A lot of arm strength is required here

08:31.611 --> 08:33.011
to support your body.

08:42.788 --> 08:45.191
Unfortunately, Changying Wang

08:45.758 --> 08:47.493
fell into the water.

08:59.839 --> 09:01.674
I don't know what to say.

09:02.008 --> 09:04.143
I don't know if I can perform later.

10:08.908 --> 10:11.911
My highest hopes
for the Indian contingent are on him.

10:14.213 --> 10:16.949
Very good jump. With ease. Effortless.

10:46.545 --> 10:48.280
Crush it.

10:48.347 --> 10:50.583
Qualified.
We will both get through. Come on.

11:32.124 --> 11:34.894
Come on, Manu! Come on!

11:37.029 --> 11:40.032
Come on, Manu. We're all behind you.

11:40.466 --> 11:41.367
Manu!

11:41.934 --> 11:46.238
Let's admire the effort Manuel's gone to
with his hair this evening.

11:46.305 --> 11:47.973
Best hair on the planet.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.743
Certainly, the best
on Ultimate Beastmaster.

11:57.216 --> 11:58.551
He is good!

11:58.617 --> 12:00.853
We can't deny he is good!

12:00.920 --> 12:03.422
-Yes, he is!
-Still, we hope he falls!

12:18.170 --> 12:19.538
Take it easy!

12:24.477 --> 12:26.746
Come on. Use your magic wand!

12:26.812 --> 12:28.481
Try and make him fall!

12:40.359 --> 12:42.128
-There you go!
-Yes!

12:42.194 --> 12:43.996
-Come on, Manu!
-That's what we like!

12:44.063 --> 12:47.166
We like your competitive spirit, Manu!

12:52.338 --> 12:56.308
-No, no!
-No, Manu!

12:57.309 --> 12:58.711
No, Manu.

12:59.812 --> 13:02.314
It looked so easy.
I thought I could do it.

13:03.415 --> 13:06.619
I lost my concentration,
and then I couldn't make the jump.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.722
Can we help you with something?

13:10.289 --> 13:13.159
Do you need anything?
You want a tea or coffee?

13:13.592 --> 13:15.161
Or a friend? Or a hug?

13:59.238 --> 14:00.239
You can do it!

14:00.906 --> 14:02.975
No! She fell...

14:03.042 --> 14:06.612
Oh, too low! What a shame.

14:14.887 --> 14:17.189
Come on, Anna! We're all with you!

14:17.256 --> 14:18.724
Come on!

14:23.195 --> 14:26.265
Oh no, not the Unicorn!

14:27.800 --> 14:28.801
No...

14:36.275 --> 14:38.911
It's very difficult but he held on to it.

14:53.325 --> 14:55.427
You scared me to death!

15:26.992 --> 15:28.260
Go for it!

15:39.405 --> 15:41.540
I'll feed Chopsy butter chicken today.

16:31.290 --> 16:35.627
I was a professional swimmer
for the Italian Federation for 25 years.

16:35.694 --> 16:39.131
I won over 30 medals in my career.

16:39.198 --> 16:44.703
My dream was to participate
at least once in the Olympic Games.

16:44.770 --> 16:48.374
But unfortunately,
that dream didn't come true.

16:48.440 --> 16:52.277
At the Italian trials, I fell
three seconds short of the qualifying time

16:52.344 --> 16:54.980
in the 100-metre butterfly, my specialty.

16:55.047 --> 16:57.116
It was a big disappointment for me.

16:57.583 --> 17:01.353
But now I'm here
and I'm ready to face the Beast.

17:01.420 --> 17:03.222
You could say,

17:03.288 --> 17:04.323
this is my Olympics.

17:04.390 --> 17:05.590
The time has come!

17:13.165 --> 17:14.233
Come on, Gabri!

17:14.299 --> 17:17.202
Come on, Gabo! Come on!

17:18.936 --> 17:20.239
Come on, Gabo!

17:59.445 --> 18:00.612
Good!

18:00.679 --> 18:04.817
Gabo, use the hugging technique.

18:04.883 --> 18:08.887
Nobody knows how to hug
better than the Italians!

18:18.897 --> 18:20.099
Come on, Gabri!

18:22.434 --> 18:26.505
Go, Italy! Go, Italy!

18:32.811 --> 18:34.413
Move on, Gabri!

18:51.763 --> 18:54.099
Come on, Gabo! Don't be afraid!

19:10.182 --> 19:12.284
Oh, no!

19:14.086 --> 19:15.721
Easy, there!

19:15.787 --> 19:17.823
I'm not even answering the French!

19:17.890 --> 19:20.859
It's all perfect! Everything is great!

19:20.926 --> 19:23.228
Clearly, the French are making fun of us.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.597
Now, I will rest.

19:25.664 --> 19:26.832
I will take care...

19:27.833 --> 19:29.434
of my injured elbow.

19:29.501 --> 19:30.903
And then we'll start again.

19:51.223 --> 19:52.824
-Come on, Axel.
-Axel!

19:52.891 --> 19:54.560
We're with you, Axel!

20:03.001 --> 20:04.403
I'm from Reunion Island.

20:05.504 --> 20:08.173
I've always been very sporty.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.175
And the day I discovered parkour,

20:10.242 --> 20:12.711
I realized that, for me, it was limitless.

20:15.414 --> 20:19.117
I trained, I tried to meet
as many people as possible,

20:19.184 --> 20:21.987
and then, after several months,
it worked out.

20:22.054 --> 20:25.691
I got a call
to start my first job in parkour.

20:25.757 --> 20:30.762
So there you go. I started a club,
and I teach parkour to all ages.

20:30.829 --> 20:33.332
I'm very happy to be here,
representing my country.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.992
I said Axel would get through.

21:00.058 --> 21:02.828
-He makes it look easy.
-So easy!

21:03.395 --> 21:04.730
Come on, man!

21:13.639 --> 21:15.207
Come on, Axel!

21:59.451 --> 22:01.486
Look at our trapeze artist!

22:10.562 --> 22:12.764
Yes!

22:34.986 --> 22:36.822
Well... I think we'll go join them.

22:36.888 --> 22:37.889
Let's go!

22:50.102 --> 22:51.870
Axel, you're in first place!

22:51.937 --> 22:54.573
You're in first place right now.
Well done!

22:54.639 --> 22:57.142
France is at the top of the leaderboard!

22:57.743 --> 23:00.712
We're really proud of you. Well done!

23:40.986 --> 23:43.188
For this level, my injury

23:43.255 --> 23:45.824
should not be a major problem.

23:45.891 --> 23:48.994
I will save all my energy
and give it everything I have,

23:49.060 --> 23:50.695
as long as my body works.

23:50.896 --> 23:53.398
I'll try to go as far as possible.

23:53.465 --> 23:57.936
Getting to the final is difficult
because it's very physical.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.773
But... I'll give it everything I've got.

26:21.212 --> 26:22.347
Go, France!

26:22.414 --> 26:23.582
Come on, big guy.

27:46.965 --> 27:50.301
Focus on where you're going next.
Put your back into it.

27:59.110 --> 28:02.113
Come on! He's so fast.
He needs to jump straight away.

28:02.180 --> 28:04.949
-Don't think about it. Go!
-Jump, jump!

28:06.351 --> 28:09.020
Wow! Amazing!

28:22.100 --> 28:24.002
Concentrate and go for it!

29:29.000 --> 29:30.935
I work in the wind power sector.

29:31.002 --> 29:34.773
I'm a technician who works at height,
and I don't like the gym.

29:34.839 --> 29:38.243
I try to be outside as much as I can.

29:40.278 --> 29:45.884
Nature is my gym. I like to be
in contact with the natural environment.

29:45.950 --> 29:51.456
Well, I'm happy to be representing Spain
and to be here facing this challenge.

29:51.523 --> 29:54.292
I'll try to leave Spain
in the best position possible.

30:15.213 --> 30:17.649
Why won't he sit down,
relax and take a look around?

30:17.715 --> 30:19.617
-No, he's doing fine.
-He will fall.

30:19.684 --> 30:22.720
-It's just that... No.
-I don't want to watch!

30:24.489 --> 30:26.191
Come on! Come on! Come on!

30:27.192 --> 30:29.828
Great! Great!

31:21.512 --> 31:24.415
Juanan! Juanan! Juanan!

31:24.983 --> 31:26.484
Come on! Great!

31:37.662 --> 31:41.232
-Look, look, look! Come on.
-That's five more points for Juanan.

31:41.299 --> 31:43.501
-He's not swinging much.
-Can he keep going?

31:44.035 --> 31:46.371
The Vertabrace is right there.
Just a bit more!

32:01.552 --> 32:02.820
I couldn't reach it.

32:02.887 --> 32:07.158
-Why couldn't you reach it?
-Because you need to gather momentum.

32:08.192 --> 32:11.863
If I had reached it with my foot,
I might have made it.

32:58.242 --> 33:02.113
That's the way to jump, buddy.
Well done, tiger.

33:02.180 --> 33:03.081
Take the leap!

36:40.698 --> 36:42.900
I'm a professional climber.

36:43.668 --> 36:46.737
When I was five,
I was always climbing all over the place,

36:46.804 --> 36:51.309
and I got stuck at the top
of a 10-meter-high gate.

36:51.375 --> 36:52.710
My mum got scared,

36:52.777 --> 36:55.479
and because she didn't want
to be scared again,

36:55.546 --> 36:57.315
she took me climbing.

36:58.716 --> 37:01.953
I'm a professional climber,
so clearly I never stopped climbing.

37:02.019 --> 37:04.555
I climb to win,
and I'm going to win this competition.

37:32.917 --> 37:34.452
That's it!

37:34.518 --> 37:37.154
Cling on, and relax. Don't get dizzy.

37:39.757 --> 37:41.892
-Come on, Manu!
-We're with you!

37:41.959 --> 37:44.228
-Come on, Manu!
-Go, France!

37:44.295 --> 37:46.364
Our French colleagues

37:46.430 --> 37:50.468
are trying their best to push forward
their fellow countryman,

37:50.534 --> 37:54.705
while we, instead,
are trying our best to jinx him!

38:20.531 --> 38:23.134
-Come on, Manu. Go, go!
-Let's go! Let's go!

38:27.405 --> 38:28.639
Good going, Manu.

38:36.414 --> 38:38.316
We jinx you!

38:38.382 --> 38:40.384
We jinx you!

38:41.952 --> 38:44.889
My spells don't work anymore!

38:44.955 --> 38:47.158
-Yes!
-Go, go, go!

40:34.265 --> 40:37.768
He's trying to figure out
whether he should go

40:37.835 --> 40:39.236
for the Point Thruster

40:39.303 --> 40:40.371
or not.

40:41.605 --> 40:42.840
Gabo!

41:07.665 --> 41:09.633
Fettuccine Alfredo!

41:09.700 --> 41:11.268
Come on!

41:18.642 --> 41:22.179
Gabri! Gabri!

41:32.857 --> 41:34.658
Come on, Gabo!

41:34.725 --> 41:36.827
-Come on, Gabo!
-Come on! Yes!

41:37.962 --> 41:39.697
He put a hand there!

41:53.544 --> 41:54.712
It's okay!

41:55.279 --> 41:56.847
Such bad luck!

41:56.914 --> 41:59.750
Francesco is dead from grief!

41:59.817 --> 42:02.219
He had a heart attack and died.

44:11.515 --> 44:15.019
My strongest opponent is you, man.

44:16.186 --> 44:18.522
At the moment I'm in second place,
behind Axel.

44:18.922 --> 44:22.693
And there's a Spanish guy
following quite closely behind me.

44:22.760 --> 44:26.130
I hope I can beat Axel later,
even though I like him a lot.

44:26.563 --> 44:29.600
We've got a little competition
going on between us.

44:50.387 --> 44:53.524
What's this you're doing, buddy?
What are you doing?

44:53.590 --> 44:55.726
I mean, it's nice, but get on with it.

44:55.926 --> 44:56.927
Let's do this later.

45:06.203 --> 45:08.338
I said you were running all wrong, buddy!

45:10.674 --> 45:13.744
That was because
you did the dance prematurely.

46:11.802 --> 46:13.704
He brought that one home!

46:49.173 --> 46:51.241
Come on! You can make it!

46:51.308 --> 46:52.709
Faster!

47:01.118 --> 47:03.086
Oh, no! Come on, Gabo!

47:05.189 --> 47:06.089
You were good!

47:27.578 --> 47:29.046
Come on, Axel. Go, go!

48:03.113 --> 48:04.114
Come on, Axel!

48:04.181 --> 48:06.183
-Go, France!
-Come on, big guy!

48:11.889 --> 48:13.523
Come on. You can still make it.

48:13.590 --> 48:14.558
It's just there!

49:23.727 --> 49:26.496
The next two are just behind me, so...

49:27.364 --> 49:29.833
I gave it everything I had, so we'll see.

50:16.646 --> 50:18.815
We need a miracle!

50:18.882 --> 50:20.884
A miracle, please. Come on, Juanan!

50:38.268 --> 50:41.772
Nothing. I just jumped into the water
to see if I could turn it into wine.

50:41.838 --> 50:43.607
But it didn't work.

50:52.616 --> 50:56.286
Look at this, look at this!
On top of it all, he comes to provoke us!

50:56.353 --> 50:57.421
He's provoking us!

53:13.089 --> 53:15.125
Come on, come on, come on!

53:44.087 --> 53:46.189
Come on, come on! Hold on!

53:46.256 --> 53:47.958
Come on. Don't give up now!

54:01.037 --> 54:03.673
Come on, the French! Come on!

54:32.202 --> 54:34.604
What an athlete! Incredible!

55:09.572 --> 55:12.909
So it's France versus France,
so it's the same thing,

55:12.976 --> 55:15.845
but it's rock climbing versus parkour.

56:00.090 --> 56:03.026
So for the time being,
Axel is doing really well.

56:14.938 --> 56:16.272
Go, Manu!

56:17.006 --> 56:19.109
Go, go, go!

56:31.154 --> 56:33.022
Come on, Axel. Go, go, go!

57:39.355 --> 57:41.758
-It's going well.
-So much force in those arms...

58:09.352 --> 58:10.887
Well done, Manu!

58:10.954 --> 58:15.458
He's just proved it's possible
to control one's mind.

58:24.667 --> 58:25.969
My arms were doing okay,

58:26.035 --> 58:28.538
but my legs couldn't have taken much more.

58:28.938 --> 58:32.909
I'm happy, but it's not over yet,
so I need to stay focused.
