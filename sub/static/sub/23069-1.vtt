<i>A great way
to win a championship.</i>

01:03.155 --> 01:05.957
<i>With a strenuous
brilliant smash...</i>

01:05.992 --> 01:07.993
<i>...Billie Jean King is the...</i>

01:08.027 --> 01:12.496
<i>...1972 champion
of the United States!</i>

01:21.239 --> 01:24.007
<i>Earlier today,
Billie Jean King continued</i>

01:24.040 --> 01:26.141
<i>what has already
been a record year...</i>

01:26.176 --> 01:28.411
<i>...with an exciting
6-4, 7-6 win</i>

01:28.445 --> 01:31.379
<i>over Rosie Casals
in a sudden-death tiebreaker.</i>

01:31.414 --> 01:32.713
<i>Billie Jean's triumph
makes her</i>

01:32.748 --> 01:35.517
<i>the most successful woman
player of all time...</i>

01:35.551 --> 01:38.620
<i>...and prompts a phone call
from a very special fan:</i>

01:38.653 --> 01:40.020
<i>President Nixon.</i>

01:40.054 --> 01:41.789
<i>Hello, Mr. President.</i>

01:41.823 --> 01:44.024
<i>Well, I just wanted
to congratulate you.</i>

01:44.058 --> 01:45.992
<i>And I'm glad to see
a fellow Californian</i>

01:46.025 --> 01:47.426
<i>gets over $100,000.</i>

01:47.460 --> 01:48.894
<i>And I'm glad
to be the first woman</i>

01:48.930 --> 01:50.029
<i>to do it, too.</i>

01:50.063 --> 01:51.164
<i>Well, I wish you well,</i>

01:51.197 --> 01:53.165
<i>and you've had
a really marvelous year.</i>

01:53.198 --> 01:56.034
<i>Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you very much, sir.</i>

01:56.069 --> 01:57.302
<i>Being queen for the day</i>

01:57.335 --> 01:58.736
<i>is not enough for this King.</i>

01:58.769 --> 02:00.336
<i>I bet you my head's too big.</i>

02:00.371 --> 02:02.173
<i>She's been
outspoken in her demands</i>

02:02.206 --> 02:04.708
<i>for higher pay
for all women players.</i>

02:05.543 --> 02:06.443
<i>Watch out, guys.</i>

02:06.477 --> 02:08.676
<i>There's no stopping
this little lady.</i>

02:08.711 --> 02:11.813
<i>Billie Jean King celebrated
her win with a big...</i>

02:30.264 --> 02:31.798
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

02:31.832 --> 02:34.100
<i>...please welcome 1972</i>

02:34.134 --> 02:36.804
<i>U.S. Open Women's
Singles Champion...</i>

02:36.836 --> 02:39.304
<i>...Billie Jean King.</i>

03:06.361 --> 03:08.531
Have you seen this?

03:08.564 --> 03:09.965
No. Hey, Gladys.

03:09.998 --> 03:11.098
You want a dance?

03:11.133 --> 03:12.366
I want a gun.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.533
They just snuck this out

03:13.568 --> 03:15.703
in the middle of the night.
Lowlifes.

03:15.737 --> 03:16.903
This is outrageous.

03:16.937 --> 03:19.506
And it's got Jack Kramer's
fingerprints all over it.

03:19.539 --> 03:22.074
You're absolutely
right it does.

03:22.110 --> 03:23.710
I know where he's hiding.

03:24.979 --> 03:26.479
You want to come?

03:26.513 --> 03:29.548
No. No, you go
do your thing.

03:29.582 --> 03:30.849
But good luck.

03:35.121 --> 03:37.221
Thank you very much, honey.

03:35.121 --> 03:37.221
Sure, Mr. Kramer.

03:37.254 --> 03:39.389
Thank you.

03:37.254 --> 03:39.389
Of course.

03:39.424 --> 03:40.825
They won't get
away with it.

03:40.858 --> 03:41.891
Uh-oh.

03:41.925 --> 03:43.593
You can't go in there.

03:43.627 --> 03:45.127
Excuse me.

03:45.163 --> 03:46.730
Wait a minute.

03:46.764 --> 03:48.765
Surprised in their lair.

03:48.798 --> 03:51.800
This is an unexpected
pleasure.

03:51.835 --> 03:54.871
My goodness, you both look
sensational, if I may say.

03:54.903 --> 03:55.836
You may not.

03:55.872 --> 03:57.372
You're not supposed
to be in here, you know.

03:57.406 --> 03:59.807
Because I'm a woman
or because I'm a Jew, Bob?

03:59.842 --> 04:02.678
Please, you're welcome here.
Have a seat.

04:04.445 --> 04:06.545
What can we do for you?

04:06.580 --> 04:08.281
Would you like
a glass of something maybe?

04:08.317 --> 04:09.784
No, thank you, Jack.

04:11.117 --> 04:13.151
I find it's best
to be clear before

04:13.187 --> 04:14.820
committing cold-blooded
murder, so...

04:15.323 --> 04:16.923
...clarify...

04:18.423 --> 04:19.690
...the press release.

04:19.725 --> 04:20.692
Ah, yes.

04:20.726 --> 04:22.293
It says here
that you're offering

04:22.327 --> 04:24.028
the men's winner $12,000...

04:24.062 --> 04:26.797
...and $1,500 to the women's.

04:26.831 --> 04:28.331
Those are the terms.

04:28.367 --> 04:30.033
The men's prize
needs to be that high

04:30.067 --> 04:31.300
to attract the best players.

04:31.334 --> 04:32.435
We're trying to make this

04:32.468 --> 04:34.170
the most prestigious
tournament in America.

04:34.204 --> 04:36.072
And paying the women
less than ever

04:36.107 --> 04:38.408
makes it more prestigious.
Uh...

04:38.440 --> 04:41.442
Well, it's simply a question
of what we can afford.

04:41.478 --> 04:43.345
People pay to see
the men play.

04:43.379 --> 04:44.713
They're the draw.

04:44.747 --> 04:46.949
They're eight times
more of a draw?

04:47.548 --> 04:48.581
Sorry?

04:48.617 --> 04:49.917
You're offering
the men's winner

04:49.951 --> 04:51.586
eight times that of the women.

04:51.620 --> 04:53.187
Do we bring in
an eighth of the crowd?

04:53.221 --> 04:55.288
I don't know
percentages, but...

04:55.322 --> 04:56.857
They sold the exact
same amount of tickets

04:56.891 --> 04:59.326
to the women's final today
as the men's.

04:59.360 --> 05:02.329
Isn't that right, Jack?

04:59.360 --> 05:02.329
Today, yeah, I suppose so.

05:02.362 --> 05:05.197
Same sales, same prize money.
Makes sense to me.

05:05.232 --> 05:06.866
Oh, come on.
Be reasonable.

05:06.899 --> 05:09.500
There's no way
that we could afford that.

05:09.535 --> 05:11.336
What's your argument, Jack?

05:12.872 --> 05:13.871
For one thing,

05:13.906 --> 05:16.441
the men have families
that they have to support.

05:16.475 --> 05:19.310
I'm the main breadwinner
in my family.

05:19.343 --> 05:21.211
Yeah. Yeah.

05:21.245 --> 05:22.445
Look.

05:25.615 --> 05:28.985
The men are simply...
more exciting to watch.

05:29.851 --> 05:31.185
They are.

05:31.220 --> 05:32.921
They're faster.

05:31.220 --> 05:32.921
Fact.

05:32.954 --> 05:34.222
And stronger.

05:32.954 --> 05:34.222
Fact.

05:34.257 --> 05:35.656
And more competitive.

05:35.690 --> 05:36.625
Just a fact.

05:36.658 --> 05:40.628
It's not your fault,
it's just... biology.

05:40.661 --> 05:44.464
That's not my point. We sell
the same amount of tickets.

05:45.665 --> 05:48.999
I'm sorry.
It's not going to happen.

05:51.670 --> 05:53.738
Well, if that's
the way it is...

05:55.408 --> 05:57.043
...we'll boycott
the tournament.

05:57.576 --> 05:58.576
Fact.

06:00.379 --> 06:02.612
Well, now...

06:02.648 --> 06:05.983
...we'll sure miss your pretty faces,
but go right ahead.

06:06.016 --> 06:07.382
Not only will we boycott,

06:07.418 --> 06:09.119
we'll set up
our own tournament.

06:09.153 --> 06:10.353
Fact.

06:10.387 --> 06:13.121
At the exact same time
as the Pacific Southwest.

06:13.156 --> 06:14.790
Fact.

06:14.824 --> 06:18.360
Be sure and send me tickets.
You have a good night, ladies.

06:20.262 --> 06:21.862
That'll never happen.

06:29.137 --> 06:31.038
Are we really
gonna do this?

06:31.906 --> 06:33.774
Sure we're gonna do this.

06:34.675 --> 06:37.009
How are we gonna do this?

06:39.012 --> 06:40.480
No idea.

06:42.180 --> 06:43.382
Right.

06:48.553 --> 06:50.821
Did you have a busy day?

06:50.855 --> 06:52.790
Run off my feet.
Not a minute to think.

06:55.459 --> 06:57.294
Whatever it is
I'm supposed to be

06:57.327 --> 06:59.061
doing down there, Priscilla,
I'm not doing it.

07:00.831 --> 07:02.265
Well, Daddy told me
that he thinks

07:02.298 --> 07:04.399
you're an integral part
of the company.

07:04.434 --> 07:05.935
Huh. Integral.

07:05.968 --> 07:08.135
Like the stapler on my desk.

07:08.170 --> 07:09.305
Well, it's steady,

07:09.338 --> 07:10.572
and it's what
you need right now.

07:10.607 --> 07:12.508
I know. I know.

07:15.843 --> 07:19.012
I wonder how much peppercorns
are in here.

07:19.045 --> 07:21.014
I don't know, Junior.

07:21.048 --> 07:22.548
I'd say about a thousand.

07:22.583 --> 07:25.552
No way! There got to be at
least five thousand in there.

07:25.584 --> 07:27.552
I'd put a dollar
on a thousand.

07:27.588 --> 07:30.623
Young man.

07:27.588 --> 07:30.623
Whoa, no, no, no.

07:30.656 --> 07:34.192
Young man, we do not gamble
at the dinner table.

07:34.226 --> 07:37.596
We do not gamble anyplace,
Bobby.

07:37.629 --> 07:40.665
Exactly.
We do not gamble anyplace.

07:42.533 --> 07:44.134
No, we do not.

07:48.204 --> 07:50.072
One dollar.

07:50.107 --> 07:51.107
Come on.

07:54.077 --> 07:55.110
All right.

07:55.978 --> 07:57.745
Oh, you know what?

07:57.779 --> 07:59.613
I just remembered, I need
to go back to the office

07:59.648 --> 08:01.450
and finish up some work.

08:02.283 --> 08:03.483
Now?

08:03.517 --> 08:05.718
Your father has been
so supportive, honey,

08:05.752 --> 08:07.154
that I don't want
to let him down.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.091
Delicious. Thank you.

08:11.125 --> 08:12.625
See you later, kiddo.

08:19.031 --> 08:20.632
I'm doubling down on Jack.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.633
Bobby, we got $1,200
on the table!

08:22.668 --> 08:24.736
$1,200, buddy!

08:29.807 --> 08:30.875
Bobby, you're not allowed

08:30.908 --> 08:32.609
to have dogs
that good-looking.

08:33.177 --> 08:34.177
Miss one!

08:35.379 --> 08:36.980
We got him on the run,
here we go!

08:37.014 --> 08:38.447
We got him on the run!

08:38.480 --> 08:40.015
Put the chair out there!

08:40.049 --> 08:42.751
Two chairs
and I'll raise you $500 each.

08:51.159 --> 08:52.793
Give the racket to the dog!

08:52.826 --> 08:54.861
Oh, too good for you.

09:01.134 --> 09:03.369
Jack, for the love of God!

09:03.403 --> 09:05.672
Damn it.

09:03.403 --> 09:05.672
Good game, Jack.

09:05.706 --> 09:08.274
I thought I had you
this time, I really did.

09:08.307 --> 09:10.542
That was a fine,
fine effort.

09:10.576 --> 09:11.909
Great try, great try.

09:11.945 --> 09:13.212
No, don't come over here.

09:13.245 --> 09:16.081
What do you expect, Jack?
Bobby's the world champ.

09:16.114 --> 09:19.516
No, I had an advantage.
It was three against one.

09:19.551 --> 09:22.386
It was three against one.

09:22.418 --> 09:24.386
You know what?
He keeps betting me,

09:24.422 --> 09:25.788
I don't know
what to do about it.

09:25.822 --> 09:28.524
The thing about Jack is,
he can afford to lose.

09:28.557 --> 09:30.025
You got to think
about Priscilla, Bobby.

09:30.058 --> 09:30.991
What is she gonna say?

09:31.027 --> 09:33.061
You still married, Bobby?

09:31.027 --> 09:33.061
Oh, barely.

09:33.096 --> 09:34.964
He sure will be if he shows up
in a Rolls-Royce.

09:34.998 --> 09:37.132
He sure as hell won't be if he
shows up in a Rolls-Royce.

09:37.166 --> 09:38.165
Why?

09:38.200 --> 09:39.266
Even Bobby
will find it tough

09:39.301 --> 09:40.435
to talk his way out
of that one.

09:40.469 --> 09:41.769
"Oh, honey, this crazy day!

09:41.803 --> 09:44.304
"This guy on the corner just
gave me a Silver Shadow."

09:44.337 --> 09:45.338
Think that'll cut it?

09:45.373 --> 09:46.439
Talk his way out of it?

09:46.474 --> 09:48.441
The man just won himself
a Rolls-Royce!

09:48.475 --> 09:49.542
Herb, you're not getting it.

09:49.576 --> 09:50.978
Bobby doesn't gamble anymore.

09:51.010 --> 09:52.278
Oh, he don't gamble anymore!

09:52.312 --> 09:53.312
No, no, no.

09:53.346 --> 09:54.746
Gamblers Anonymous
once a week,

09:54.780 --> 09:56.580
shrink twice a week.
I'm a reformed man.

09:56.615 --> 09:58.451
There you are.

09:56.615 --> 09:58.451
Oh, there you go.

09:58.484 --> 09:59.984
You know what? Actually,
Lornie's got a point.

10:00.019 --> 10:01.985
That vehicle's kind
of big to hide.

10:02.019 --> 10:04.588
Jack, why don't you just
keep it for a little while?

10:04.623 --> 10:06.456
You saying
I'm not good for a bet?

10:06.490 --> 10:08.725
No, no, no.
Just keep the engine warm

10:08.759 --> 10:10.159
and don't nick up the paint.

10:14.530 --> 10:15.764
"$100,000 Girl?"

10:15.798 --> 10:18.634
You don't see even a senior
tour making a hundred G's.

10:18.668 --> 10:20.202
Oh, she reckons she ought
to get more than that.

10:20.235 --> 10:21.468
Same as the men.

10:21.503 --> 10:23.738
She's not happy
with $100,000?

10:23.772 --> 10:26.141
That Billie Jean King,
what is her problem?

10:26.174 --> 10:27.841
Bobby, you got to remember,
nowadays it's all

10:27.875 --> 10:29.842
equality this, equality that.

10:29.878 --> 10:31.711
They're burning bras,
for God's sake.

10:31.746 --> 10:32.779
Why would they
ever pay the women

10:32.813 --> 10:34.113
the same as the guys?

10:34.148 --> 10:36.014
All I can tell you
is that there is nothing wrong

10:36.048 --> 10:38.616
with a nice girl in a short
skirt chasing a ball.

10:38.652 --> 10:40.753
You know,
I won the goddamn U.S. Open.

10:40.787 --> 10:43.022
I could beat Billie Jean King
or any of those women.

10:43.056 --> 10:45.323
But are they offering me
equal prize money on the tour?

10:45.356 --> 10:46.757
No, sir, I'm getting peanuts.

10:46.793 --> 10:47.993
Hey, there's a bet for you.

10:48.028 --> 10:48.927
What's that?

10:48.960 --> 10:51.028
Bobby Riggs
vs. Billie Jean King.

10:51.062 --> 10:53.264
I'd pay a lot to see that.

10:59.937 --> 11:01.171
Hey, everybody?

11:01.971 --> 11:03.773
I know
what you're all risking,

11:03.806 --> 11:06.074
because I'm risking
the exact same thing.

11:06.109 --> 11:07.009
More.

11:07.043 --> 11:10.044
No, not more.
The same.

11:10.078 --> 11:12.513
We're all putting our careers
on the line for this.

11:12.547 --> 11:14.783
So I just want to thank you
for your bravery.

11:16.018 --> 11:17.151
And your balls.

11:19.187 --> 11:21.020
Are we gonna get our hair
done before every event?

11:21.054 --> 11:22.789
Because I could
get used to this.

11:22.823 --> 11:25.791
The salon is a once-only
because the press is here.

11:25.826 --> 11:27.326
And because
I love you so much.

11:27.360 --> 11:30.028
Tomorrow the press won't be
here and I won't love you.

11:30.063 --> 11:31.663
This is a budget tour,
ladies...

11:31.697 --> 11:33.365
which means
you will be sharing rooms.

11:33.399 --> 11:34.432
So you might as well start

11:34.466 --> 11:35.633
getting to know
each other now.

11:35.667 --> 11:37.002
I call bunking with Val!

11:37.035 --> 11:39.370
I thought you were gonna
get us a sponsor, Gladys.

11:39.404 --> 11:41.273
I... was. I...

11:42.006 --> 11:43.640
...am, Rosie.

11:43.674 --> 11:47.676
It's just that right now
we are broke, so shut up.

11:47.711 --> 11:49.912
Well, wait. What about
our prize money?

11:49.947 --> 11:51.681
Oh, Val, why are you
worried about prize money?

11:51.715 --> 11:53.014
You only get that if you win.

11:54.115 --> 11:55.817
All right, you've got
30 minutes before

11:55.851 --> 11:58.385
you show your faces
to the press.

11:58.421 --> 11:59.821
Hi.

11:58.421 --> 11:59.821
Hi.

11:59.855 --> 12:01.923
I've been moving around
too much, haven't I?

12:01.956 --> 12:03.090
Yeah.

12:03.124 --> 12:06.194
I'm sorry, I've been, uh...
I'm excited.

12:07.195 --> 12:09.163
Or nervous or something.

12:09.197 --> 12:10.697
You're all tennis players?

12:10.730 --> 12:12.697
Yeah. You don't watch tennis?

12:12.732 --> 12:14.967
Oh, no. I don't have a TV.

12:15.001 --> 12:17.102
But I admire
what you guys are doing.

12:17.136 --> 12:19.103
Sounds like you girls are
getting men to pay attention

12:19.139 --> 12:21.072
to what you're saying
for once.

12:21.107 --> 12:22.707
You know what would
really get their attention?

12:22.743 --> 12:23.975
A sex strike.

12:24.009 --> 12:26.978
What? That would punish us
just as much as the men.

12:27.011 --> 12:28.812
I don't think
I'd even miss it.

12:28.846 --> 12:31.281
My ex went about it like
he was fixing the carburetor

12:31.315 --> 12:32.682
on the Oldsmobile.

12:32.716 --> 12:34.717
And he could never
get that damn car to start.

12:35.352 --> 12:36.618
Rosie, come on!

12:36.653 --> 12:38.121
At least women know
where the carburetor is.

12:40.190 --> 12:41.424
So...

12:41.457 --> 12:42.824
...Billie Jean...

12:43.594 --> 12:45.228
...what do you want?

12:48.096 --> 12:49.364
What do you mean?

12:51.634 --> 12:53.634
With your hair. What do you
want to do with it?

12:53.668 --> 12:55.870
Oh.

12:57.205 --> 12:58.372
It doesn't matter.

12:58.407 --> 12:59.973
You can just get it
out of my face.

13:00.005 --> 13:02.241
You don't care
about how you look?

13:03.376 --> 13:05.245
Someone as pretty as you?

13:07.779 --> 13:10.481
Uh, it's... I'm not...

13:10.515 --> 13:12.216
...pret... I mean, I don't...

13:13.519 --> 13:16.721
Thank you for...
for saying that.

13:20.258 --> 13:21.859
What's your name again?

13:22.658 --> 13:23.994
Marilyn.

13:29.432 --> 13:34.102
Would you let me just...
give you a little trim?

13:36.171 --> 13:40.040
It'll make you feel like
a whole new person.

13:40.075 --> 13:43.076
I don't think a haircut's ever
made me feel quite like that.

13:48.249 --> 13:49.883
Is that perfume?

13:49.917 --> 13:51.918
It's lavender oil.

13:51.951 --> 13:55.253
I put it on my wrists
just to relax the customers.

13:55.288 --> 13:56.722
It's nice.

14:37.057 --> 14:38.957
I love it.

14:38.993 --> 14:40.293
Billie Jean!

14:40.326 --> 14:42.160
Come on!

14:40.326 --> 14:42.160
I'm coming!

14:42.195 --> 14:43.061
All right!

14:43.095 --> 14:44.830
What is she doing in there?

14:44.864 --> 14:46.565
It was nice to meet you.

14:46.599 --> 14:48.167
Nice to meet you.

14:50.302 --> 14:51.969
You know what?

14:52.003 --> 14:54.272
We've got a tournament
in San Diego, actually,

14:54.306 --> 14:57.108
next month,
and I have a lot of tickets.

14:57.140 --> 14:59.074
So you could just
bring everyone and...

14:59.110 --> 15:01.110
Billie Jean, let's go!

14:59.110 --> 15:01.110
It's a lot of fun.

15:01.144 --> 15:02.846
Yeah, everyone's
invited to come.

15:02.879 --> 15:04.813
Next month in San Diego.

15:04.847 --> 15:06.414
So... thank you again.

15:06.450 --> 15:08.050
Thank you.

15:08.083 --> 15:08.950
Finally.

15:08.985 --> 15:10.118
We're gonna be late!

15:10.152 --> 15:13.221
Do you think there'll be
any cute photographers?

15:13.255 --> 15:15.322
Peaches, I know
he's very cute, but let's go.

15:15.357 --> 15:16.389
Girls, get in line.

15:16.424 --> 15:18.725
Get ready, and let's get
these contracts signed.

15:18.759 --> 15:19.894
Welcome to the WTA.

15:19.927 --> 15:22.830
Thank you so much
for joining us.

15:23.764 --> 15:25.865
That makes you
a professional.

15:25.899 --> 15:26.966
Rosie, it's a pleasure.

15:27.199 --> 15:28.134
Keep this going. Don't dawdle.

15:28.168 --> 15:29.601
One dollar, Billie Jean.

15:29.635 --> 15:30.836
Yeah, a whole dollar is right.

15:30.870 --> 15:33.004
I'm gonna save it!

15:33.038 --> 15:34.438
Thank you.
Welcome to the WTA.

15:34.474 --> 15:35.474
Where do we sit?

15:35.508 --> 15:36.508
Billie Jean.

15:38.778 --> 15:40.345
Guess who showed up.

15:41.778 --> 15:43.246
Judy, come on.
Don't be shy.

15:43.280 --> 15:45.715
This is an
exciting day, girls. Look excited.

15:45.750 --> 15:47.552
Thank you very much.

15:47.585 --> 15:50.420
Okay, girls. Come on,
let's start sitting, please.

15:50.453 --> 15:52.121
It's a big day, ladies.
Kerry, you're next.

15:52.155 --> 15:53.488
We're gonna
take a big picture.

15:53.524 --> 15:55.256
Billie Jean...

15:55.291 --> 15:59.261
...what you're doing here
is a big mistake.

15:59.294 --> 16:01.996
Are you here to give us
another option, Jack?

16:02.029 --> 16:03.396
On behalf of the USLTA,

16:03.431 --> 16:07.600
I'm here to ask you girls
not to do anything hasty.

16:07.635 --> 16:09.903
So what are you offering?

16:09.937 --> 16:11.336
I'm offering to keep you in

16:11.370 --> 16:14.140
the United States
Lawn Tennis Association.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.143
You're kicking us out.

16:18.177 --> 16:20.011
You do this,
you're becoming our rivals.

16:20.046 --> 16:21.848
We have no option.

16:22.947 --> 16:24.515
I'll sure miss
your pretty face, Jack,

16:24.549 --> 16:26.918
but you go right ahead.

16:26.951 --> 16:28.620
Great.
And then we'll put Billie...

16:28.653 --> 16:31.054
I'm gonna have a very exciting
moment in a second.

16:31.089 --> 16:33.624
This is monumental.
Billie Jean?

16:33.658 --> 16:34.758
One minute!

16:34.792 --> 16:36.192
If you're not in the USLTA,

16:36.226 --> 16:38.495
you can't play
the Grand Slams.

16:38.528 --> 16:40.261
No Wimbledon. No nothing.

16:40.297 --> 16:41.797
I get it.

16:41.831 --> 16:42.965
But what are your
Grand Slams

16:43.000 --> 16:45.534
without the greatest
women players in the world?

16:45.567 --> 16:47.468
They're not so grand.

16:47.503 --> 16:50.171
So I appreciate you coming,
Jack, very much...

16:50.206 --> 16:51.639
...but if you have
nothing to offer us,

16:51.673 --> 16:53.542
I have a contract to sign.

16:55.442 --> 16:56.576
Bye, Jack.

16:59.346 --> 17:03.283
Okay, girls,
hold those dollars up. Beautiful.

17:04.351 --> 17:06.886
Smile, girls.
This isn't a funeral.

17:06.920 --> 17:09.054
Hold up that dollar.

17:11.557 --> 17:12.490
Keep smiling, ladies,

17:12.525 --> 17:14.692
but we've just been
kicked out of the USLTA.

17:14.727 --> 17:15.926
What?

17:16.828 --> 17:19.430
Wave them
so Jack can see them!

17:20.999 --> 17:25.067
Yep, it's a dollar, girls.
Remember that... One dollar.

17:37.846 --> 17:39.980
Is that it? For all of you?

17:40.015 --> 17:41.616
Can I have some ketchup?

17:43.984 --> 17:45.852
Who died?

17:45.886 --> 17:47.386
Hey, Gladys.

17:47.422 --> 17:50.824
Oh, I get it.
It's all my fault.

17:50.856 --> 17:52.858
Well, Gladys has got
just the thing

17:52.893 --> 17:55.495
for you miserable ingrates.

17:59.030 --> 18:00.397
Cigarettes?

18:00.432 --> 18:02.834
Ladies and gentle-ladies,
may I present to you

18:02.868 --> 18:04.968
the Virginia Slims
Championships.

18:05.002 --> 18:07.971
A Gladys Heldman/Philip Morris
co-production.

18:08.006 --> 18:09.640
Smoking your guts out across

18:09.674 --> 18:11.007
the United States
of America...

18:11.041 --> 18:13.376
...in exchange for twelve
months funding...

18:13.410 --> 18:16.413
...and prize money of...
drum roll, please...

18:18.915 --> 18:20.782
...$7,000.

18:20.816 --> 18:22.283
Really?

18:20.816 --> 18:22.283
Way to go, Mom!

18:22.317 --> 18:24.519
For every tournament?

18:22.317 --> 18:24.519
For every tournament.

18:24.553 --> 18:27.922
That ought to perk up
your lousy second serve.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.558
You do the tennis,
I'll do the smoking.

18:31.593 --> 18:34.995
My girls, from now on
we are fully funded.

18:35.028 --> 18:36.528
I put in a call
to Ted Tinling,

18:36.563 --> 18:40.400
who's gonna be our personal
couturier on tour.

18:40.433 --> 18:42.134
You're each gonna
have your own tennis dresses

18:42.167 --> 18:44.736
designed specially for you.

18:44.770 --> 18:46.203
And I put in a call
to every woman

18:46.238 --> 18:47.773
who's ever picked up a racket.

18:47.807 --> 18:48.807
Guess who's already signed on.

18:48.839 --> 18:49.907
Oh. Oh.

18:49.942 --> 18:52.009
Don't guess. Margaret Court.

18:53.244 --> 18:55.779
"The Arm."
Billie Jean, are you scared?

18:55.814 --> 18:57.380
I can take her.

18:57.414 --> 18:58.447
Yeah?

18:57.414 --> 18:58.447
Yeah.

18:58.482 --> 19:00.317
Well, you'll get
your chance soon enough.

19:00.351 --> 19:02.685
Waitress!
Ice cream sundaes all around.

19:02.719 --> 19:04.921
We're in the money.

19:04.954 --> 19:06.187
But...

19:06.221 --> 19:08.724
...not all around.
Just my table and these two.

19:08.759 --> 19:11.594
Let's try the buttercup,
lemony sort of hue.

19:11.626 --> 19:14.930
But I don't really feel it
pops with your complexion,

19:14.963 --> 19:16.931
so let's try the blue.

19:16.964 --> 19:18.932
Oh! It's wonderful, Ted.

19:18.965 --> 19:21.300
You like it?

19:18.965 --> 19:21.300
I love it!

19:21.336 --> 19:22.769
And what will the esteemed

19:22.804 --> 19:25.773
Lawn Tennis Association
say about this?

19:25.806 --> 19:27.606
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you,

19:27.641 --> 19:31.010
for the first time
in the history of tennis...

19:31.412 --> 19:32.778
...color!

19:32.811 --> 19:35.179
The shock will kill
the old dears.

19:49.960 --> 19:51.360
87 KMRP.

19:51.394 --> 19:52.996
It's twelve minutes
after 7:00,

19:53.029 --> 19:55.064
and we are privileged,
tennis fans...

19:55.096 --> 19:57.464
...to have the great
Billie Jean King

19:57.500 --> 19:59.500
in the studio with us today,
along with a...

19:59.536 --> 20:02.104
...a lot of very lively
WTA tennis players.

20:02.136 --> 20:03.703
Say hi, ladies.

20:03.739 --> 20:05.073
Hi.

20:05.106 --> 20:07.641
The word is that you gals
are renegades

20:07.675 --> 20:09.843
from the tennis establishment.
Is that right?

20:09.876 --> 20:10.943
Yeah.

20:10.979 --> 20:12.278
The U.S. Lawn
Tennis Association

20:12.313 --> 20:14.415
wasn't really giving us women
our fair share,

20:14.449 --> 20:15.849
so we thought...

20:15.883 --> 20:17.383
..."Hey, we'll do it
on our own."

20:17.416 --> 20:18.716
Taking the bull by the horns.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.219
That's right.

20:21.288 --> 20:22.520
<i>We do everything.</i>

20:22.555 --> 20:24.890
<i>We are the ones laying down
the courts.</i>

20:24.923 --> 20:26.758
<i>We're selling tickets.</i>

20:26.791 --> 20:27.958
<i>We're doing publicity.</i>

20:27.992 --> 20:30.528
<i>And we have to fit in practice
somewhere in between there.</i>

20:30.561 --> 20:32.261
<i>We are also
trying to get tennis away</i>

20:32.297 --> 20:34.398
<i>from the stuffy old
country club sport.</i>

20:34.432 --> 20:36.266
<i>We want it to be
for everybody.</i>

20:36.300 --> 20:39.502
<i>It's 1973, so... we could
update a couple things.</i>

20:40.436 --> 20:41.770
<i>Now, you all
play each other</i>

20:41.805 --> 20:43.105
<i>in the tournaments and...</i>

20:43.138 --> 20:45.273
<i>...you room together as well.</i>

20:45.307 --> 20:47.541
<i>So how does that work
when you have to room</i>

20:47.576 --> 20:49.111
<i>with somebody
who just beat you...</i>

20:49.144 --> 20:50.310
...or who you just defeated?

20:50.346 --> 20:52.413
It's fine,
because I usually win.

20:52.446 --> 20:54.314
Oh. That's not true at all.

20:54.348 --> 20:56.549
It's fine if you're not
rooming with Rosie.

20:56.585 --> 20:59.420
Oh, okay. Don't room with
Rosie... That's the message.

20:59.452 --> 21:02.655
We're also, you know,
united for a greater cause.

21:02.690 --> 21:04.457
<i>So it keeps the focus
on something else.</i>

21:04.491 --> 21:06.026
<i>It's bigger than the match.</i>

21:06.058 --> 21:08.259
Nice to meet you. Bye!

21:08.294 --> 21:11.997
Do you all consider yourselves
women's libbers?

21:12.030 --> 21:13.531
Oh, sure.

21:12.030 --> 21:13.531
I think so.

21:13.565 --> 21:15.432
What we're doing here
is trying to prove

21:15.468 --> 21:18.067
that women should be paid
and respected equally.

21:18.103 --> 21:19.570
We're just as entertaining
as the men.

21:19.605 --> 21:21.471
You're definitely
cuter than the men.

21:23.507 --> 21:25.909
<i>It must get a little
lonely out there on the road.</i>

21:25.943 --> 21:28.412
<i>Don't you ever miss
your husbands?</i>

21:28.444 --> 21:30.678
<i>Sure. Of course we do.</i>

21:30.713 --> 21:33.281
<i>I talk to Larry
on the phone every day.</i>

21:33.316 --> 21:36.018
<i>We're used to it. As pros,
we're not home very often.</i>

21:36.050 --> 21:37.685
And some of us
don't have husbands.

21:37.720 --> 21:38.586
Whoa.

21:38.621 --> 21:40.455
Single men,
you heard it here first.

21:40.489 --> 21:42.923
Some of these ladies
are single themselves.

21:42.958 --> 21:45.559
Especially Peaches.
Come on out.

21:45.593 --> 21:47.894
Yeah, bring your daughters.

21:45.593 --> 21:47.894
Or your sons.

21:47.929 --> 21:49.063
Or bring everyone.

21:49.096 --> 21:50.931
You could bring
your whole family.

21:50.963 --> 21:52.197
That's the point of this tour.

21:52.231 --> 21:54.867
It's for everyone,
and it's a whole lot of fun.

21:54.902 --> 21:57.303
You heard it here, folks.
We'll get in more music,

21:57.336 --> 21:58.670
but we got tickets
to give away,

21:58.703 --> 22:00.204
so give us a call.

22:00.239 --> 22:01.773
Thanks for coming by, ladies.

22:01.807 --> 22:03.074
Thank you for having us.

22:03.107 --> 22:05.409
Good luck.

22:03.107 --> 22:05.409
Come on out!

22:13.983 --> 22:16.452
It's not exactly the Ritz.

22:18.355 --> 22:20.690
Margaret Court!
Welcome to the nuthouse.

22:20.722 --> 22:22.657
Hi, Ted.

22:20.722 --> 22:22.657
Hey, Margaret.

22:22.692 --> 22:23.724
Billie Jean.

22:23.759 --> 22:26.361
If you're looking for
the restaurant or the spa

22:26.394 --> 22:28.494
or the swimming pool,
there isn't one.

22:28.529 --> 22:29.730
But if you're looking
for the tickets

22:29.765 --> 22:32.066
you're gonna sell
at the intersection...

22:32.099 --> 22:33.600
they're right here.

22:33.634 --> 22:36.303
Have a lovely evening.
Darling child.

22:45.011 --> 22:46.144
She's never liked me.

22:46.179 --> 22:47.513
Who? Gladys?

22:47.547 --> 22:50.615
No, the great
Billie Jean King.

22:50.648 --> 22:51.948
You just do your talking

22:51.983 --> 22:53.451
on the court, honey.

22:54.286 --> 22:56.221
Come on, cross over!

22:56.253 --> 22:57.520
You can do it. There you go.

22:57.555 --> 22:58.989
Watch out for the alligators.

22:59.022 --> 23:00.289
I'm watching out
for the alligator.

23:00.325 --> 23:01.959
You watch out
for the alligator.

23:01.992 --> 23:04.226
I'm going across
the wobbly bridge.

23:04.260 --> 23:06.962
Your mother's always
watching us. Right here.

23:06.997 --> 23:08.264
Right here. Okay.

23:08.298 --> 23:09.699
That'll burn you
right to the bones.

23:09.731 --> 23:10.798
That's quicksand.

23:10.833 --> 23:13.235
That's quicksand, all right.
Acid quicksand.

23:13.269 --> 23:15.502
That's why you never
see any of your siblings.

23:15.538 --> 23:17.305
Two rocks.
Don't fall in the quicksand!

23:17.337 --> 23:19.239
Don't fall in the quicksand!

23:19.272 --> 23:22.242
Okay. One more rock
and we're there.

23:22.277 --> 23:24.378
Good. You got it.

23:22.277 --> 23:24.378
What if I don't make it?

23:24.412 --> 23:25.511
You can make it!
You're a Riggs,

23:25.546 --> 23:28.247
you're gonna make it.
One, two, three...

23:28.281 --> 23:30.482
Whoa, whoa.

23:31.151 --> 23:33.220
Well, we almost made it.

23:36.690 --> 23:38.891
Hey, honey!
Could you get that?

23:38.923 --> 23:40.023
Okay.

23:40.057 --> 23:41.893
I'm reading Junior a story.

23:45.930 --> 23:47.163
Bobby?

23:47.198 --> 23:49.032
Do you know anything
about a, uh...

23:49.066 --> 23:52.302
Rolls-Royce! Cool!

23:52.336 --> 23:53.937
Damn it, Jack.

23:55.605 --> 23:57.940
Mom, it's got a TV!

23:59.542 --> 24:00.742
Oh, my God.

24:00.776 --> 24:02.777
I know, I know. Um...

24:02.811 --> 24:03.744
It was Jack's idea.

24:03.778 --> 24:05.480
You are like a little kid,
you know that?

24:05.513 --> 24:07.347
Well, you're good with kids.

24:07.383 --> 24:09.048
After everything
we talked about?

24:09.083 --> 24:10.985
Everything you promised me?

24:16.221 --> 24:18.557
Okay, okay, I get it.
Give me those.

24:20.827 --> 24:23.328
Where are you going?

24:23.362 --> 24:25.764
Can I come, too?

24:23.362 --> 24:25.764
No, you can't come.

24:25.798 --> 24:26.832
Junior!

24:31.635 --> 24:33.936
All right.

24:31.635 --> 24:33.936
Thanks, Mrs. Court.

24:33.971 --> 24:35.573
Thanks for coming.

24:36.374 --> 24:37.807
Did you like it?

24:37.842 --> 24:38.975
It was amazing.

24:40.611 --> 24:42.578
Thanks for coming.

24:40.611 --> 24:42.578
Thank you.

24:42.612 --> 24:44.947
Nice to meet you.

24:42.612 --> 24:44.947
Nice to meet you.

24:44.980 --> 24:46.315
Nice hair.

24:46.848 --> 24:48.349
You came!

24:48.384 --> 24:51.287
Why didn't you tell me
how good you are?

24:51.819 --> 24:53.288
Ah, well.

24:55.223 --> 24:57.356
Can I ask you a question?

24:57.392 --> 24:59.994
You may.
I may not answer it.

25:01.394 --> 25:03.297
Do you like dancing?

25:04.698 --> 25:05.832
I do.

25:06.566 --> 25:07.833
Yeah.

25:11.703 --> 25:15.740
<i>¶ I wish she'd
come walking over ¶</i>

25:17.808 --> 25:21.980
<i>¶ Now I've been waiting
to show her ¶</i>

25:24.582 --> 25:27.918
<i>¶ Crimson and clover ¶</i>

25:30.586 --> 25:34.022
<i>¶ Over and over ¶</i>

25:35.924 --> 25:38.259
I can't believe
how you move on the court.

25:38.294 --> 25:41.129
It's like watching
some kind of...

25:41.163 --> 25:42.764
...wild animal.

25:42.797 --> 25:44.899
Aw, come on.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

25:44.932 --> 25:49.470
Enjoyed it? I've never seen
anything like it! It was...

25:50.403 --> 25:52.971
It must be intoxicating.

25:53.006 --> 25:54.641
What? Playing tennis?

25:56.576 --> 25:58.644
Being inside your skin.

25:59.144 --> 26:01.113
Excuse me.

26:01.146 --> 26:03.781
I'm so sorry for doing this.

26:03.816 --> 26:06.285
Mrs. King,
I'm such a huge fan.

26:06.317 --> 26:08.117
Oh. Thank you so much.

26:08.153 --> 26:09.419
I'm Miles.

26:09.453 --> 26:10.754
Miles. Great to meet you.

26:10.788 --> 26:13.223
Do you dance
as well as you serve?

26:13.257 --> 26:14.557
Oh, thanks, I don't think...

26:14.592 --> 26:16.693
Tonight we're just gonna
stay here and watch.

26:16.727 --> 26:18.961
Okay.

26:16.727 --> 26:18.961
But nice to meet you, Miles.

26:18.994 --> 26:20.061
You, too.

26:20.863 --> 26:22.597
I'd love to dance!

26:24.133 --> 26:25.768
Well, sure thing.

26:47.220 --> 26:50.056
<i>¶ Crimson and clover ¶</i>

26:50.088 --> 26:52.956
<i>¶ Over and over ¶</i>

26:52.991 --> 26:55.626
<i>¶ Crimson and clover ¶</i>

26:55.660 --> 26:58.495
<i>¶ Over and over ¶</i>

26:58.529 --> 27:01.464
<i>¶ Crimson and clover ¶</i>

27:01.499 --> 27:04.601
<i>¶ Over and over ¶</i>

27:04.634 --> 27:07.336
<i>¶ Crimson and clover ¶</i>

27:07.371 --> 27:09.939
<i>¶ Over and over ¶</i>

27:13.241 --> 27:14.909
Let me do yours?

27:25.118 --> 27:26.653
You're perfect.

27:32.258 --> 27:33.359
I got to go soon.

27:33.393 --> 27:34.826
What?

27:34.861 --> 27:36.228
No.

27:34.861 --> 27:36.228
Yeah.

27:36.261 --> 27:38.230
I got to get a bus
back to L.A.

27:38.263 --> 27:39.497
No, it's too late for that.

27:39.530 --> 27:41.566
You can't take
a bus right now.

27:42.267 --> 27:44.634
You can stay in my room.

27:44.670 --> 27:47.605
I've got two beds.
Honestly, it's no trouble.

27:48.138 --> 27:49.138
Okay.

27:49.973 --> 27:51.240
Thanks.

27:51.275 --> 27:52.843
Sure. Yeah.

28:01.416 --> 28:02.884
This is me.

28:03.285 --> 28:04.486
Us.

28:04.854 --> 28:05.987
Me.

28:16.563 --> 28:18.264
So, Gladys used to
make us share rooms,

28:18.298 --> 28:21.133
but we can afford our own now.

28:21.167 --> 28:22.801
I usually take the bed
closest to the window.

28:22.835 --> 28:25.837
But it's fine!
Take whichever one you want.

28:52.928 --> 28:54.195
I'm married.

28:57.199 --> 28:59.200
That's okay.

28:59.232 --> 29:01.969
I've got a boyfriend.
Sort of.

29:04.204 --> 29:05.806
But you, uh...

29:07.339 --> 29:08.807
...you...

29:12.445 --> 29:14.913
...with women... too?

29:17.482 --> 29:18.682
Yeah.

29:20.218 --> 29:22.219
Do you?

29:20.218 --> 29:22.219
No.

29:23.621 --> 29:25.222
No, never. I'm...

29:26.891 --> 29:29.093
There's only ever been Larry.

29:31.928 --> 29:33.196
So...

29:35.230 --> 29:36.832
...can I kiss you?

29:40.836 --> 29:42.003
Mmm.

30:01.053 --> 30:04.089
We can take it slow,
that's okay. There's no...

30:41.387 --> 30:42.754
<i>I have to, Mare.</i>

30:42.789 --> 30:45.624
<i>It's one of the few sure
things I can count on in life.</i>

30:45.659 --> 30:46.726
<i>Come on, Rhoda.</i>

30:46.759 --> 30:48.393
<i>You love your mother
and you know it.</i>

30:48.426 --> 30:49.793
<i>Of course I love her.</i>

30:49.827 --> 30:51.296
<i>I just think she's holding
a grudge because</i>

30:51.330 --> 30:52.496
<i>I didn't go
into the profession</i>

30:54.032 --> 30:55.299
<i>Housewife.</i>

30:58.135 --> 31:00.003
<i>My mother, she's here!</i>

31:02.440 --> 31:03.538
<i>You're beautiful.</i>

31:03.574 --> 31:04.773
<i>And in sporting news,</i>

31:04.807 --> 31:06.909
<i>we turn to the world
of women's tennis...</i>

31:06.942 --> 31:09.644
<i>...as Billie Jean King beat
Kristy Pigeon today,</i>

31:09.678 --> 31:12.181
<i>two sets to zero,
in San Diego.</i>

31:12.214 --> 31:15.317
<i>Next, the Virginia Slims tour
heads to Los Angeles.</i>

31:15.352 --> 31:18.086
<i>In baseball, the Yankees
have started 0 and 3</i>

31:18.118 --> 31:20.754
<i>after being swept on the road
by the Red Sox.</i>

31:32.732 --> 31:34.700
Oh, it's Larry.

31:34.733 --> 31:36.801
Oh, God, what if it's Gladys?

31:36.836 --> 31:38.671
Jesus,
what if it's my parents?

31:38.703 --> 31:41.105
Well, none of 'em can see
down the phone, can they?

31:41.140 --> 31:43.674
Don't joke. Don't joke.
Just don't...

31:43.709 --> 31:44.875
Don't say anything, okay?

31:44.910 --> 31:47.912
Just be quiet.
Just be quiet, okay?

31:49.446 --> 31:50.680
Hello?

31:50.714 --> 31:52.415
<i>Eureka!</i>

31:52.450 --> 31:53.583
Hello?

31:53.616 --> 31:54.716
<i>Eureka, Billie Jean!</i>

31:54.750 --> 31:55.850
Who is this?

31:55.884 --> 31:57.720
It's Bobby. Bobby Riggs.

31:57.753 --> 32:00.455
<i>Bobby?
How'd you get my number?</i>

32:00.490 --> 32:02.190
Called every hotel
in San Diego.

32:02.224 --> 32:03.857
Listen, I had a great idea.

32:03.893 --> 32:05.759
Okay. Well, it's after
midnight, Bobby,

32:05.794 --> 32:07.562
so can we talk another time?

32:07.595 --> 32:08.627
<i>You and me, Billie Jean.</i>

32:08.663 --> 32:11.598
<i>Three sets,
five sets... Your choice.</i>

32:11.633 --> 32:12.833
Are you drunk, Bobby?

32:12.866 --> 32:14.100
No, of course not!

32:14.135 --> 32:16.970
"Man vs. Woman."

32:17.003 --> 32:20.005
"Male Chauvinist Pig
vs. Hairy-Legged Feminist".

32:20.039 --> 32:23.108
No offense. You're still
a feminist, right?

32:23.142 --> 32:25.710
No, I'm a tennis player
who happens to be a woman.

32:25.744 --> 32:27.846
That's right.
That's exactly who you are.

32:27.880 --> 32:31.116
And I am a tennis player
who happens to be a man...

32:31.148 --> 32:33.516
<i>...who says that he can beat
any woman on the planet.</i>

32:33.551 --> 32:36.086
<i>Think of the publicity that
we get. Think of the money.</i>

32:36.121 --> 32:37.354
No.

32:37.387 --> 32:39.054
<i>Thirty-five grand.</i>

32:39.088 --> 32:40.889
Where'd you get
that kind of money?

32:40.923 --> 32:43.526
You see? You're tempted.

32:40.923 --> 32:43.526
<i>I'm really not.</i>

32:43.559 --> 32:45.259
I'm not interested, Bobby.
Good night.

32:45.295 --> 32:46.628
<i>Don't hang up.</i>

32:46.663 --> 32:49.131
And by the way,
I shave my legs.

32:52.535 --> 32:54.168
Who was that?

32:54.201 --> 32:58.239
That was just some crazy old
hustler trying to get a game.

32:58.271 --> 32:59.172
I hope you don't mind.

32:59.207 --> 33:01.275
I borrowed something
to sleep in.

33:03.544 --> 33:04.878
Marilyn.

33:07.180 --> 33:08.181
Ah.

33:09.950 --> 33:12.384
You're gonna give me
the speech, aren't you?

33:12.419 --> 33:14.020
I'm sorry.

33:15.153 --> 33:17.055
Whatever I...

33:17.088 --> 33:20.424
...may feel,
I can't act on it.

33:22.626 --> 33:25.995
There's too much at stake.
I mean the tennis tour and...

33:26.030 --> 33:27.263
Yeah.

33:27.297 --> 33:29.399
And I have my husband.

33:29.432 --> 33:31.166
He's a great...

33:31.201 --> 33:34.903
...person, and he would be
heartbroken if he found out.

33:34.936 --> 33:37.638
And my parents
would never speak to me again.

33:37.673 --> 33:39.141
Hey, hey, hey.

33:39.808 --> 33:41.276
I get it.

33:42.143 --> 33:43.277
Okay.

33:53.420 --> 33:54.788
Oh, hey.

33:55.454 --> 33:56.756
Thanks.

34:01.961 --> 34:03.895
'Night.

34:01.961 --> 34:03.895
Good night.

34:23.079 --> 34:24.079
Hi.

34:33.855 --> 34:35.456
<i>Hello?</i>

34:35.489 --> 34:37.456
Larry, are you awake?

34:37.489 --> 34:39.360
<i>Dad?</i>

34:37.489 --> 34:39.360
Can I come up?

34:40.226 --> 34:41.594
<i>Okay.</i>

34:50.469 --> 34:52.170
Hey there, kiddo.

34:52.204 --> 34:53.204
Hey.

34:56.373 --> 34:57.974
Just for tonight.

34:59.344 --> 35:01.211
Maybe tomorrow.

35:01.246 --> 35:02.380
Sure, sure.

35:05.481 --> 35:07.717
Oh, a little misunderstanding.

35:07.751 --> 35:10.620
Sometimes Priscilla
goes off the deep end.

35:10.653 --> 35:12.855
Oh, hey... did you see
my Rolls-Royce?

35:13.621 --> 35:15.757
Yeah, that's cool, Dad.

35:15.791 --> 35:17.025
You gonna live in it?

35:17.057 --> 35:19.393
Yeah, well, I could. I could.
It's big enough.

35:19.427 --> 35:22.362
But no, no, no.
I got plans, Larry. Big plans.

35:22.398 --> 35:23.398
Right.

35:24.931 --> 35:28.999
Yeah, well,
I've... heard 'em.

35:28.902 --> 35:30.369
All of 'em.

35:30.936 --> 35:32.336
Good night, kiddo.

35:32.371 --> 35:33.405
Good night, Dad.

35:49.521 --> 35:50.988
Priscilla!

35:51.688 --> 35:53.156
Honey!

35:54.257 --> 35:55.523
Honey!

35:55.559 --> 35:57.627
Honey, come on.

35:57.661 --> 36:00.028
Not even a fresh pair
of underpants?

36:00.563 --> 36:02.030
Toothbrush?

36:04.666 --> 36:07.169
Can't we just talk about this?

36:11.672 --> 36:13.440
You know... Oh.

36:16.844 --> 36:18.043
Oh.

36:20.581 --> 36:22.048
Thank you!

36:28.954 --> 36:31.289
<i>My name is Bobby
and I am an addict.</i>

36:31.322 --> 36:32.824
<i>Hi, Bobby.</i>

36:32.858 --> 36:35.459
<i>At least
that's what Priscilla says.</i>

36:35.494 --> 36:38.196
She's gonna leave me
unless I quit gambling.

36:40.230 --> 36:42.432
Puzzles me, though,
"Gambling."

36:44.134 --> 36:45.967
Whenever Priscilla gets a car
out of the garage,

36:46.001 --> 36:47.235
she's gambling big time.

36:47.269 --> 36:49.938
Never checks the mirror.
Sticks it in reverse.

36:49.972 --> 36:51.840
Puts her foot down,
right out onto the highway.

36:51.873 --> 36:54.242
Jeez Louise, that's gambling!

36:54.275 --> 36:57.544
But here I am,
Gamblers Anonymous.

36:57.579 --> 36:59.947
And your point is what, Bobby?

36:59.981 --> 37:03.083
Life's a gamble, right?

37:03.117 --> 37:04.951
That's the thrill of it!

37:04.985 --> 37:06.485
You know,
you folks aren't here

37:06.518 --> 37:08.221
because you're gamblers.

37:08.255 --> 37:11.423
You are here because
you are terrible gamblers.

37:11.458 --> 37:12.625
Well, let's...

37:12.657 --> 37:15.860
That's the problem. You lose,
and that's why you're here.

37:15.894 --> 37:16.994
Okay, Bobby...

37:17.028 --> 37:18.262
I've been looking at you
guys yammering on

37:18.297 --> 37:19.998
about all of your stuff and...

37:20.030 --> 37:22.699
..."Oh, woe is me"
and "This is terrible."

37:22.733 --> 37:24.235
But you know
what the problem is?

37:24.268 --> 37:25.969
The problem is
you don't have a "thing."

37:26.003 --> 37:27.837
Can we just...

37:26.003 --> 37:27.837
They don't have a thing.

37:27.871 --> 37:29.605
They need an edge.
You need an angle,

37:29.639 --> 37:31.273
an inside track, something...

37:31.307 --> 37:34.110
...that's gonna turn you from
being a gambler to a hustler.

37:34.143 --> 37:35.242
All right, Bobby, thank you.

37:35.277 --> 37:36.410
From a loser to a winner.

37:36.445 --> 37:38.512
Why should we give up
the one thing in life

37:38.547 --> 37:40.248
that we really love?

37:40.282 --> 37:42.451
These folks don't need to stop
what they're doing,

37:42.483 --> 37:44.116
they just need
to get better at it.

37:44.152 --> 37:46.420
Okay, Bobby, please.

37:44.152 --> 37:46.420
Who's dealing? Who's in?

37:47.222 --> 37:48.222
Huh?

37:49.657 --> 37:51.157
I'm heartbroken.

37:51.190 --> 37:53.159
I don't know why
she won't meet me halfway.

37:53.193 --> 37:55.860
I mean, is that too
unreasonable to ask?

37:55.894 --> 37:57.161
Have you considered
you might be

37:57.195 --> 37:58.797
coming at this from
the wrong angle?

37:58.831 --> 38:02.300
Every angle, Doc.
I have tried every angle, believe me.

38:02.335 --> 38:04.135
I know we've discussed
this before.

38:04.168 --> 38:05.902
Oh, I don't know.

38:05.938 --> 38:08.773
You're an alpha male.
She's an alpha female.

38:08.806 --> 38:10.006
Maybe you have
to face the fact

38:10.041 --> 38:11.909
that she's just not
the right woman for you.

38:11.943 --> 38:13.910
Nah, I understand
what you're saying...

38:13.943 --> 38:15.179
...but Billie Jean would make

38:15.213 --> 38:17.447
the best match
by a million miles.

38:17.481 --> 38:21.718
She is the leader of
these women. The face.

38:21.751 --> 38:25.019
At this rate, she's not even
gonna be Number 1 next season.

38:25.054 --> 38:26.153
She's not?

38:26.188 --> 38:28.923
Nope. Margaret Court.

38:28.956 --> 38:31.993
Really? The Arm's
gonna be Number 1?

38:33.293 --> 38:34.295
Huh.

38:34.795 --> 38:36.129
Stick or twist?

38:37.264 --> 38:38.264
Twist.

38:39.532 --> 38:41.601
Jack of Hearts. Too bad.

38:41.635 --> 38:45.037
The point is, not only is
Margaret gonna be Number 1...

38:45.072 --> 38:47.507
...but she's a different
kind of woman.

38:47.539 --> 38:49.206
You think she'd play me?

38:49.242 --> 38:51.176
She's a nice
old-fashioned girl, Bobby.

38:51.210 --> 38:53.177
She'll do as
she's damn well told.

38:57.648 --> 38:59.682
I shouldn't have had so much
to drink last night.

38:59.717 --> 39:01.085
It's inexcusable.

39:01.119 --> 39:02.820
You had like half a drink.

39:02.853 --> 39:04.719
Well... that's half
a drink too many.

39:04.755 --> 39:06.088
It's the finals this week.

39:06.123 --> 39:07.923
Where are my keys?

39:07.958 --> 39:09.593
I think they're in your hand.

39:10.126 --> 39:12.194
Thank you. Okay.

39:13.128 --> 39:14.261
You should leave now.

39:14.297 --> 39:15.697
Then I'll follow
in about five minutes.

39:15.731 --> 39:16.597
All right.

39:16.632 --> 39:18.099
Or actually that will
seem suspicious.

39:18.134 --> 39:19.666
Maybe you should
just stay here.

39:19.701 --> 39:20.702
Okay.

39:22.737 --> 39:25.205
You said
you'd give me a ride.

39:25.706 --> 39:27.974
Right. Right.

39:28.009 --> 39:29.675
Right on. Okay.

39:29.710 --> 39:30.810
Ready to go?
Got everything?

39:30.844 --> 39:31.943
Yeah.

39:31.978 --> 39:34.312
Sorry about that.
I'm just a little...

39:42.188 --> 39:44.122
Be careful
with that mannequin, Henry.

39:44.155 --> 39:46.257
Of course, Ted.

39:48.793 --> 39:50.760
Well, look what we have here.

39:50.795 --> 39:51.728
Late!

39:51.762 --> 39:53.898
<i>And a little deshabille,
wouldn't you say?</i>

39:53.931 --> 39:57.032
I would, Henry.
I most definitely would.

39:57.068 --> 39:59.035
And what
do you think Larry would say?

39:59.068 --> 40:00.469
He must know.

40:01.670 --> 40:03.305
Well, there's knowing...

40:03.338 --> 40:04.905
...and there's knowing.

40:04.940 --> 40:06.140
Nobody later than four.

40:06.175 --> 40:07.475
Rosie? Where's Rosie?

40:07.509 --> 40:08.509
I'm here.

40:09.777 --> 40:11.711
No more
speeding tickets, okay?

40:11.746 --> 40:14.047
This is tennis, not NASCAR.

40:14.081 --> 40:16.349
And girls, I am begging you,
for God's sake...

40:16.382 --> 40:18.317
some Slims at the photo call.

40:18.351 --> 40:20.052
They've been great to us,

40:20.086 --> 40:22.387
and we need them
to renew our contract.

40:22.422 --> 40:25.291
And I like it.
I mean, look at me. Mmm.

40:26.358 --> 40:27.925
Right?

40:27.960 --> 40:30.096
You're late. And who's that?

40:30.996 --> 40:34.065
This? My, uh, my friend.

40:34.099 --> 40:36.934
Marilyn from the salon
in L.A.

40:36.967 --> 40:38.201
Wait, is she coming
on tour with us?

40:38.235 --> 40:39.603
That's a great idea.

40:39.637 --> 40:40.804
Oh, no, she is not.

40:40.838 --> 40:42.873
Please, Gladys. With all the
photo shoots we're doing,

40:42.907 --> 40:44.074
we need a hairdresser.

40:44.106 --> 40:45.806
That would be an N
followed by an O.

40:45.842 --> 40:47.076
How's your spelling, Val?

40:47.110 --> 40:49.345
No, no, no.
She lives in L.A.

40:49.378 --> 40:51.278
She works
at the salon in L.A.

40:51.313 --> 40:53.081
She can't just come
on the road.

40:53.114 --> 40:54.615
Come on.

40:53.114 --> 40:54.615
It's not... No.

40:54.650 --> 40:59.320
They're not gonna miss me
for just a few days.

40:59.353 --> 41:01.553
Yeah. I mean,
we could all pay a little bit.

41:01.588 --> 41:03.356
Yes, please, Gladys?
Look at them!

41:03.391 --> 41:05.625
They get in my eyes.
I can't see the ball.

41:05.659 --> 41:06.659
Please, Mom?

41:06.693 --> 41:09.027
Please, I've had no time
to get these bangs done.

41:09.061 --> 41:10.228
It's a great idea, Mom.

41:10.264 --> 41:12.097
Imagine having
your own stylist.

41:12.130 --> 41:13.431
Just for a little while.

41:13.465 --> 41:15.501
Can you do anything
with this?

41:15.534 --> 41:17.335
Of course! Yeah.

41:18.304 --> 41:20.070
Ugh. Get in the car.

41:23.541 --> 41:25.409
Is this okay?

41:26.344 --> 41:29.280
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, it's good.

41:51.898 --> 41:52.798
Hello.

41:52.833 --> 41:55.934
You do know what she is,
don't you? That...

41:55.969 --> 41:57.702
...woman with Billie Jean?

41:59.204 --> 42:00.938
Hairdresser?

42:00.972 --> 42:02.574
I think it's her lover.

42:04.108 --> 42:05.576
That girl?

42:06.311 --> 42:07.913
And Billie Jean?

42:08.614 --> 42:09.813
She's married.

42:10.780 --> 42:13.217
They usually are.

42:13.251 --> 42:16.019
That's what happens on an
all-women circuit, Barry.

42:16.052 --> 42:19.255
Licentiousness. Immorality.

42:19.722 --> 42:20.889
Sin.

42:20.923 --> 42:23.893
Really? Because she shouldn't
be allowed on tour.

42:23.927 --> 42:25.628
On the contrary.

42:25.661 --> 42:27.627
Well, isn't she ashamed
of herself?

42:27.663 --> 42:30.965
She is ashamed.
That's exactly what she is.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.833
And her game's
gonna fall to pieces.

42:33.802 --> 42:36.903
<i>¶ She packed my
bags last night ¶</i>

42:36.938 --> 42:37.972
<i>¶ Pre-flight ¶</i>

42:41.208 --> 42:44.677
<i>00 am ¶</i>

42:47.579 --> 42:51.784
<i>¶ And I'm gonna be high... ¶</i>

42:52.818 --> 42:55.887
What happened last night
can't happen again.

42:57.489 --> 43:00.257
We have to stop
fooling around.

43:00.291 --> 43:03.927
I wasn't fooling around.
I was dead serious.

43:03.960 --> 43:05.327
Listen.

43:05.362 --> 43:07.130
Larry doesn't even
come on tour with me,

43:07.164 --> 43:08.864
because I can't have
the distraction.

43:08.898 --> 43:11.933
I have to focus on my game
a hundred percent.

43:11.967 --> 43:14.069
I promise not to distract you.

43:14.103 --> 43:16.438
But you do distract me.

43:17.572 --> 43:19.773
You distract me
just being here.

43:21.242 --> 43:22.710
Who are you?

43:24.112 --> 43:26.847
What are you doing with me?

43:26.880 --> 43:29.348
I'm Marilyn Kathryn Barnett.

43:29.382 --> 43:32.018
I'm good with my hands.

43:32.052 --> 43:34.620
I don't like being
told what to do.

43:34.653 --> 43:38.090
And I just met
the most interesting person.

43:38.123 --> 43:40.826
I'm not that interesting.
I promise.

43:41.594 --> 43:43.427
All I think about is tennis.

43:43.461 --> 43:46.398
We don't have to do anything
you don't want to do. Okay?

43:47.264 --> 43:48.965
Friends?

43:49.000 --> 43:50.967
Okay.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.967
Really good friends?

43:51.001 --> 43:52.269
Okay.

43:54.672 --> 43:57.740
I swear, I don't know what
to do with myself around you.

43:59.208 --> 44:00.876
Just drive.

44:02.945 --> 44:04.946
<i>¶ ...Brings me round
again to find ¶</i>

44:04.981 --> 44:08.250
<i>¶ I'm not the man
they think I am at home ¶</i>

44:08.282 --> 44:11.085
<i>¶ Oh, no, no, no ¶</i>

44:11.119 --> 44:14.655
<i>¶ I'm a rocket man ¶</i>

44:14.688 --> 44:19.960
<i>¶ Rocket man burning out
his fuse up here alone ¶</i>

44:23.096 --> 44:28.367
<i>¶ And I think it's gonna be

44:30.101 --> 44:34.306
<i>¶ And I think it's gonna be

44:37.007 --> 44:41.345
<i>¶ And I think it's gonna be

44:43.947 --> 44:48.483
<i>¶ And I think it's gonna be

44:51.619 --> 44:53.320
<i>¶ And I think it's gonna be
a long, long time ¶</i>

45:01.996 --> 45:04.030
I know. Shh.

45:11.737 --> 45:12.871
Bobby.

45:12.905 --> 45:15.407
Barry, how you doing?
Been a long time. How are you?

45:17.076 --> 45:18.443
What do you want?

45:18.478 --> 45:19.911
Five minutes is all.

45:19.945 --> 45:21.244
And if you don't like
what I have to say,

45:21.278 --> 45:22.380
you'll never hear
from me again.

45:22.414 --> 45:24.248
Is that a promise?

45:22.414 --> 45:24.248
Let him in.

45:24.282 --> 45:25.983
Hey, Margaret,
how are you?

45:26.018 --> 45:26.949
This better be good.

45:26.983 --> 45:28.384
No one's getting
a lot of sleep around here.

45:28.418 --> 45:30.252
Oh, it's good! It's good.

45:30.286 --> 45:32.120
Who's this?

45:30.286 --> 45:32.120
That's Daniel.

45:32.155 --> 45:33.855
Daniel! Do you mind?

45:33.889 --> 45:35.257
May I?

45:33.889 --> 45:35.257
Yeah.

45:35.291 --> 45:39.128
Oh, Daniel, come here, you.
Oh, you're so big!

45:39.161 --> 45:41.528
Oh, Daniel, hello!

45:41.563 --> 45:44.731
Bobby's gotcha.
Bobby's gotcha.

45:44.766 --> 45:48.001
Yeah, that's right.
Oh, look at you.

45:48.034 --> 45:50.670
Oh, Margaret, he is lovely.

45:50.704 --> 45:53.373
Hi! Do any of the other girls
have kids?

45:53.907 --> 45:55.007
Nope, just me.

45:55.043 --> 45:55.974
Just you. Wow!

45:56.009 --> 45:59.878
That has got to be tough.
Tough on your mom.

45:59.913 --> 46:01.679
Playing all day
and then taking care

46:01.715 --> 46:03.515
of you at night. Oh, boy!

46:03.547 --> 46:05.315
That's got to be...
And all the traveling?

46:05.351 --> 46:06.684
You know what?
You need a nanny.

46:06.719 --> 46:08.686
A nanny.

46:06.719 --> 46:08.686
You know how much they cost?

46:08.721 --> 46:10.554
That's exactly why I'm here.

46:10.588 --> 46:13.356
Because I think $35,000 would
buy you a lot of nanny.

46:13.391 --> 46:15.092
What is your game,
Bobby Riggs?

46:15.126 --> 46:16.226
A match. You versus me.

46:16.260 --> 46:18.629
Two out of three sets.
$35,000.

46:21.197 --> 46:22.697
Well... why me?

46:22.733 --> 46:24.567
Why you?
Because you're the best.

46:24.601 --> 46:26.334
Billie Jean has been
on me to play her,

46:26.367 --> 46:27.735
but you know what she's like.

46:27.769 --> 46:28.804
Yeah.

46:28.838 --> 46:31.506
And besides, I always say
if you're gonna play...

46:31.539 --> 46:33.641
...play the number one.

46:33.675 --> 46:35.509
Billie Jean's number one.

46:35.543 --> 46:37.978
Not if you beat her tomorrow.

46:38.012 --> 46:40.948
Isn't that right?
Is your mom gonna beat her?

46:42.615 --> 46:46.251
40 down.
"Lumberjack's tool."

46:46.286 --> 46:48.186
Four letters.

46:48.219 --> 46:49.320
Anything?

46:49.355 --> 46:50.588
Oh, my.

46:49.355 --> 46:50.588
What?

46:50.623 --> 46:52.090
It's Larry.

46:50.623 --> 46:52.090
Hmm?

46:52.492 --> 46:53.959
Larry King.

46:55.226 --> 46:56.427
Oh.

46:57.628 --> 46:58.561
Oh.

46:58.597 --> 47:00.799
I think I'd better make
a phone call.

47:13.643 --> 47:14.676
Hello?

47:14.710 --> 47:17.612
<i>Ted here, darling.
A petite heads up.</i>

47:17.646 --> 47:19.948
<i>Larry is in the building.</i>

47:19.981 --> 47:21.349
Shit.

47:19.981 --> 47:21.349
<i>Be careful.</i>

47:21.382 --> 47:22.850
Okay. Thanks.

47:24.052 --> 47:25.853
Hey.

47:24.052 --> 47:25.853
Oh.

47:26.521 --> 47:28.088
Going up?

47:26.521 --> 47:28.088
Thanks.

47:28.123 --> 47:30.423
Yeah. 31.

47:30.456 --> 47:31.657
Me, too.

47:45.003 --> 47:46.471
Starting early.

47:48.005 --> 47:49.539
Oh, well, you know
what they say...

47:49.574 --> 47:51.375
it's never too early
for champagne.

47:51.409 --> 47:53.978
My kinda girl.

47:54.010 --> 47:55.244
You here for the tennis?

47:55.278 --> 47:56.846
I sure am.

47:56.880 --> 47:57.981
Me, too.

47:58.014 --> 48:00.683
I think Billie Jean's
gonna take it.

48:01.617 --> 48:03.619
Oh, are you a fan?

48:05.086 --> 48:06.822
You could say that.

48:10.025 --> 48:11.159
After you.

48:22.302 --> 48:23.469
Well, see you around.

48:23.503 --> 48:24.769
Maybe.

48:33.311 --> 48:34.679
Hi! Oh.

48:34.713 --> 48:35.547
Hi.

48:35.579 --> 48:37.780
Hi!

48:35.579 --> 48:37.780
Hi, honey.

48:40.284 --> 48:41.751
Oh, this is Marilyn.

48:42.820 --> 48:44.086
Oh.

48:44.121 --> 48:45.722
Larry.

48:44.121 --> 48:45.722
Oh, hi, hi.

48:46.590 --> 48:47.757
Marilyn is the, the...

48:47.791 --> 48:49.191
The hairdresser around here.

48:49.224 --> 48:52.027
And... Larry is... the...

48:52.061 --> 48:53.260
The husband around here.

48:53.295 --> 48:54.628
The husband around here.

48:54.663 --> 48:57.164
Peaches wants me
to give her a blow dry.

48:57.199 --> 48:58.199
Great.

48:59.534 --> 49:00.634
Marilyn!

48:59.534 --> 49:00.634
Uh-huh?

49:00.668 --> 49:03.070
Was the ice
for Billie Jean's knees?

49:05.539 --> 49:06.839
Yeah.

49:06.873 --> 49:08.942
Yeah, I'll get that. Thanks.

49:06.873 --> 49:08.942
Bye.

49:10.010 --> 49:11.011
Bye.

49:18.418 --> 49:20.619
Here. Let me.

49:21.420 --> 49:22.619
Okay.

50:04.590 --> 50:07.192
The roads were clear,
so I made good time.

50:11.730 --> 50:13.396
I should've called ahead,

50:13.431 --> 50:15.733
letting you know
that I was coming.

50:27.208 --> 50:28.676
Leg up.

50:39.887 --> 50:40.954
Switch.

50:41.822 --> 50:43.023
Here.

50:51.063 --> 50:52.063
Uh...

51:00.637 --> 51:02.639
I'm gonna get another room.

51:07.909 --> 51:08.978
I've got phone calls to make,

51:09.012 --> 51:11.381
and you need to rest
for the finals.

52:11.833 --> 52:15.436
<i>Point to Mrs. Court. Love-15.</i>

52:31.449 --> 52:33.217
<i>Love-30.</i>

52:33.251 --> 52:35.119
Jesus Christ, Billie.

52:36.786 --> 52:39.122
Come on, dumby. Come on.

52:52.168 --> 52:55.269
<i>Love-40. Match point.</i>

53:10.751 --> 53:14.221
<i>Game, set and match
to Mrs. Court.</i>

53:38.442 --> 53:39.909
That was bad.

53:41.842 --> 53:43.911
You don't seem yourself.

53:50.251 --> 53:52.452
I was thinking of
heading home.

53:55.722 --> 53:56.990
Really?

53:58.992 --> 54:01.827
There's lots to do
from there and...

54:01.862 --> 54:03.362
...I was thinking...

54:03.394 --> 54:07.398
...I could give you some space
and let you clear your head.

54:08.367 --> 54:09.368
Mmm-hmm.

54:15.873 --> 54:18.141
Talk to you soon.

54:15.873 --> 54:18.141
Yeah.

54:24.746 --> 54:26.347
Man.

54:27.817 --> 54:29.150
Damn.

54:30.753 --> 54:31.954
Hi.

54:32.487 --> 54:33.488
Hi.

54:34.690 --> 54:36.657
Have you got a cigarette?

54:36.692 --> 54:37.891
Nope.

54:39.960 --> 54:41.794
Billie Jean know you smoke?

54:41.829 --> 54:44.798
Uh... I guess not.

54:44.831 --> 54:47.065
She's not a fan.

54:47.099 --> 54:49.367
Well, I won't tell
if you won't.

54:50.402 --> 54:54.039
Secrets, huh? There's a lot
of those going around.

54:55.974 --> 54:58.443
Marilyn, you know
how all this gets paid for?

54:59.244 --> 55:00.177
Yeah, the...

55:00.210 --> 55:04.480
...the prize money,
rackets, hotels, flights...

55:04.514 --> 55:06.382
...the food, everything?

55:06.918 --> 55:08.285
Sponsorship.

55:08.318 --> 55:10.185
And with sponsorship,
that would go away in a heartbeat

55:10.219 --> 55:13.121
if certain things
were to be made public.

55:14.523 --> 55:17.926
I only have Billie Jean's
best interests at heart.

55:18.661 --> 55:20.561
Look.

55:20.596 --> 55:21.862
You seem like
a sweet girl and...

55:21.898 --> 55:23.465
Don't condescend to me.

55:24.398 --> 55:25.766
Please.

55:25.800 --> 55:29.103
You know,
I'm not the competition.

55:29.137 --> 55:31.839
I'm just her husband,
and you're...

55:33.072 --> 55:35.141
...you're just a phase.

55:36.076 --> 55:38.378
We're both just sideshows.

55:38.411 --> 55:40.311
Tennis is her true love.

55:40.346 --> 55:44.048
And if you get between her
and the game, you'll be gone.

56:07.036 --> 56:09.336
Met Bobby Riggs last night.

56:09.371 --> 56:10.438
Funny man.

56:11.273 --> 56:12.574
Tell me you didn't.

56:12.608 --> 56:14.175
Didn't what?

56:15.710 --> 56:18.412
He just wants to play
an exhibition match is all.

56:18.445 --> 56:20.880
Now that I'm officially
number one.

56:20.914 --> 56:24.750
It's not a tennis match,
Margaret. You do know that.

56:24.784 --> 56:26.218
What do you mean?

56:26.251 --> 56:29.020
He tried that exhibition
match line on me.

56:29.054 --> 56:32.089
Oh. And I suppose
you turned him down?

56:32.123 --> 56:33.323
Are you kidding me?

56:33.358 --> 56:35.559
You think I want to join
the Bobby Riggs circus?

56:35.592 --> 56:39.163
He wants to make himself look
great and women look stupid.

56:39.197 --> 56:42.166
It's not a match.
It's a show.

56:42.199 --> 56:45.835
I can understand why you might
not want to play him, but...

56:45.869 --> 56:47.470
...I've got nothing to hide.

57:00.548 --> 57:02.849
Mind those seams
when taking that off.

57:02.884 --> 57:04.519
She's gonna play Bobby Riggs.

57:04.552 --> 57:08.855
The Arm versus The Mouth.
I know where my money's going.

57:08.889 --> 57:12.592
What if she loses, Ted?
What if she blows it?

57:12.625 --> 57:14.293
He's never gonna let it go.

57:14.327 --> 57:16.895
He's gonna make women's tennis
look like a laughingstock.

57:16.929 --> 57:19.764
Calm yourself,
Madame Superstar.

57:19.798 --> 57:21.298
Margaret is playing
better than ever,

57:21.333 --> 57:23.268
and I don't need
to remind you.

57:24.168 --> 57:26.804
<i>And strictly entre nous...</i>

57:26.838 --> 57:29.573
...we've had to make some
adjustments in the bicep area.

57:29.606 --> 57:31.039
Haven't we, Henry?

57:31.074 --> 57:33.009
About an inch and a half.

57:34.577 --> 57:35.978
I'm just glad
you're not playing him.

57:36.012 --> 57:38.047
Not a chance.

57:40.815 --> 57:42.683
Best be careful.

57:42.717 --> 57:43.985
What do you mean?

57:45.320 --> 57:48.589
The world isn't always
a forgiving place, my dear.

57:54.262 --> 57:56.597
How are you so free
with yourself?

57:57.965 --> 58:00.133
Seems like you just do
whatever you want.

58:00.166 --> 58:03.036
I don't do whatever I want.

58:03.068 --> 58:05.837
I pay taxes,
visit the dentist.

58:05.871 --> 58:07.538
You know what I mean.

58:09.074 --> 58:11.309
I'm one of eight kids.

58:11.342 --> 58:12.976
So...

58:13.010 --> 58:15.378
...no one noticed what I did.

58:15.414 --> 58:16.713
Which is probably
for the best,

58:16.746 --> 58:19.949
because I would've shocked
the hell out of all of 'em.

58:23.820 --> 58:25.221
I don't know.

58:26.389 --> 58:29.392
I live... a private life...

58:30.360 --> 58:31.527
...and...

58:31.559 --> 58:35.029
...I guess I never think that
people will care what I do.

58:41.568 --> 58:44.637
God, I think everyone
cares what I do.

58:47.039 --> 58:49.242
I'm gonna let them all down.

58:51.045 --> 58:54.380
When I was a kid,
I played at this tennis club.

58:56.514 --> 58:57.715
I was...

58:58.384 --> 58:59.650
...twelve.

59:01.585 --> 59:05.020
It was team photo time,
which is a very big deal.

59:07.057 --> 59:09.260
And my mom made me these...

59:09.293 --> 59:10.459
...white tennis shorts,

59:10.492 --> 59:12.761
because we couldn't afford
a tennis dress.

59:13.731 --> 59:15.198
And...

59:15.998 --> 59:17.365
...the man that ran it,

59:17.400 --> 59:19.134
we were all lined up
to take the photo

59:19.168 --> 59:21.103
and he pointed at me
and he said...

59:21.137 --> 59:23.672
..."That little girl
cannot be in the photo...

59:23.704 --> 59:26.239
..."because she's not
wearing a tennis dress."

59:27.141 --> 59:28.541
That must've crushed you.

59:28.577 --> 59:29.644
No.

59:31.143 --> 59:32.611
I just thought...

59:33.146 --> 59:34.748
...that does it.

59:36.882 --> 59:39.516
I'm gonna be the best.

59:39.552 --> 59:43.355
That way I can really...
change things.

59:45.090 --> 59:47.225
That way I have a voice.

59:49.894 --> 59:51.628
You have a voice.

01:00:09.945 --> 01:00:11.612
Dad?

01:00:09.945 --> 01:00:11.612
Larry!

01:00:11.646 --> 01:00:14.481
Sorry I can't stay long.
I'm training.

01:00:14.514 --> 01:00:15.915
What the hell are you wearing?

01:00:15.949 --> 01:00:17.616
Ah. It's a sauna suit.

01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:19.519
It's killing me,
but every time I breathe,

01:00:19.554 --> 01:00:20.586
I lose a pound.

01:00:20.621 --> 01:00:22.788
You hear the news?
Bobby's back!

01:00:22.822 --> 01:00:23.955
Yeah, yeah, I heard.

01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:25.324
You heard, huh?
Isn't it great?

01:00:25.358 --> 01:00:26.626
Is it really happening?

01:00:26.659 --> 01:00:29.295
Oh, it's happening.
It is happening! Say...

01:00:30.128 --> 01:00:32.096
You want to help?

01:00:30.128 --> 01:00:32.096
What with?

01:00:32.130 --> 01:00:34.998
What with?
With training, with support.

01:00:35.032 --> 01:00:37.099
Hit some balls
for your old man.

01:00:37.135 --> 01:00:38.970
Lornie's coming in.

01:00:39.003 --> 01:00:40.503
I don't know. Why me?

01:00:40.538 --> 01:00:44.007
Why you?
You're my son, that's why.

01:00:44.041 --> 01:00:46.242
Do this thing together.
Come on!

01:00:46.277 --> 01:00:48.510
The Riggs boys
against the world!

01:00:48.545 --> 01:00:50.646
You think you can beat her?

01:00:48.545 --> 01:00:50.646
Oh.

01:00:50.679 --> 01:00:53.347
This Margaret thing
is just the beginning.

01:00:53.382 --> 01:00:55.216
It's gonna be huge.

01:01:02.423 --> 01:01:04.090
<i>Three-time Wimbledon Champion,</i>

01:01:04.125 --> 01:01:06.358
<i>four times Women's
Single Champion</i>

01:01:06.393 --> 01:01:08.227
<i>in the United States...</i>

01:01:08.262 --> 01:01:10.030
<i>...winner of the Grand Slam
of tennis,</i>

01:01:10.063 --> 01:01:11.396
<i>and current leading
money winner</i>

01:01:11.431 --> 01:01:13.132
<i>of the Women's Pro Tour.</i>

01:01:13.166 --> 01:01:15.601
<i>From Australia,
meet Margaret Court.</i>

01:01:16.603 --> 01:01:17.702
<i>Her opponent...</i>

01:01:17.737 --> 01:01:19.837
<i>...twice the United States
Singles Champion,</i>

01:01:19.871 --> 01:01:21.639
<i>also a winner at Wimbledon.</i>

01:01:21.672 --> 01:01:24.107
<i>A man who in 1967
was enshrined</i>

01:01:24.141 --> 01:01:26.109
<i>into the Tennis Hall of Fame.</i>

01:01:26.143 --> 01:01:29.246
<i>Colorful and controversial
Bobby Riggs.</i>

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:32.382
<i>Who's your money on, Jack?
Mankind or womankind?</i>

01:01:32.416 --> 01:01:34.250
Bobby Riggs,
without a doubt.

01:01:34.284 --> 01:01:36.419
Margaret Court
is a great tennis player,

01:01:36.452 --> 01:01:38.554
there's no mistake
about that, but the...

01:01:38.588 --> 01:01:41.391
<i>...thing about women
is that they find it hard</i>

01:01:41.423 --> 01:01:43.425
<i>to consistently
handle the pressure.</i>

01:01:43.458 --> 01:01:45.927
Some would say
they're not built for it.

01:01:55.902 --> 01:01:57.035
Excuse me!

01:01:57.070 --> 01:01:58.437
It's started already!

01:01:58.472 --> 01:01:59.939
Virginia Slims coming through!

01:01:59.974 --> 01:02:01.440
Where are the TVs?

01:02:01.472 --> 01:02:04.308
Quickly! Come on, Henry.

01:02:04.342 --> 01:02:06.043
We don't want to miss this.

01:02:06.079 --> 01:02:07.546
Everybody, shut up!

01:02:07.579 --> 01:02:09.514
That's the last
of our laundry quarters.

01:02:10.981 --> 01:02:12.949
It's on what channel?

01:02:12.985 --> 01:02:14.151
Can we have
some quiet here?

01:02:14.184 --> 01:02:15.652
Please?

01:02:14.184 --> 01:02:15.652
Where, on four?

01:02:15.686 --> 01:02:16.887
Yeah, it's four.

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:17.920
Oh! There we are.

01:02:17.954 --> 01:02:19.554
Oh, my God.
This is big.

01:02:19.590 --> 01:02:21.458
Of course
it's big. It's Bobby.

01:02:21.492 --> 01:02:22.892
The one thing that man
can do is hustle.

01:02:22.927 --> 01:02:24.193
I'll say.

01:02:24.226 --> 01:02:25.927
<i>Bobby Riggs
is two games away</i>

01:02:25.961 --> 01:02:27.563
<i>from winning this first set.</i>

01:02:27.597 --> 01:02:29.030
<i>Rather easily,
I might add.</i>

01:02:29.065 --> 01:02:30.398
Oh, my God.

01:02:30.432 --> 01:02:32.300
<i>Margaret may not
realize what she's up against.</i>

01:02:32.333 --> 01:02:35.036
I think we should have been
there to support her.

01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:36.303
You have
a tournament to play.

01:02:36.338 --> 01:02:38.406
I own you, Peaches,
don't forget that.

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.710
What a dreadful choice
of blue!

01:02:43.244 --> 01:02:44.478
Oh, God.

01:02:44.512 --> 01:02:46.213
<i>If she doesn't
start attacking the ball,</i>

01:02:46.246 --> 01:02:47.780
<i>she's gonna
fall into his trap.</i>

01:02:47.813 --> 01:02:49.181
She looks spooked.

01:02:49.215 --> 01:02:51.349
Do we like the dress?

01:02:51.385 --> 01:02:53.485
It's one of Ted's.
Are we allowed not to?

01:02:53.518 --> 01:02:54.985
Right behind you, darling.

01:02:55.019 --> 01:02:56.521
We love the dress!

01:02:56.556 --> 01:02:57.588
Thank you.

01:02:57.623 --> 01:02:58.655
<i>I'm just hoping that Margaret</i>

01:02:58.690 --> 01:03:00.190
<i>will really start
hitting the ball</i>

01:03:00.224 --> 01:03:02.226
<i>and follow her serve
to the net.</i>

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:04.495
<i>I don't see how
she can win staying back.</i>

01:03:04.528 --> 01:03:06.764
<i>It looks like
Bobby's just toying with her.</i>

01:03:06.797 --> 01:03:08.364
<i>That's gonna have
a demoralizing</i>

01:03:08.398 --> 01:03:09.597
<i>effect on Margaret</i>

01:03:09.632 --> 01:03:11.099
<i>if she thinks
he's just horsing around.</i>

01:03:11.135 --> 01:03:12.635
Oh, dear.

01:03:11.135 --> 01:03:12.635
<i>Let's face it.</i>

01:03:12.668 --> 01:03:14.804
<i>She just can't handle
Bobby's game.</i>

01:03:17.407 --> 01:03:18.874
Come on!

01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:23.710
Nice one.

01:03:23.744 --> 01:03:24.846
Bravo!

01:03:26.981 --> 01:03:28.215
The Arm'll be fine.

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:29.617
She could squeeze
the life out of that

01:03:29.650 --> 01:03:31.985
little twerp with one
tweak of her bicep.

01:03:35.255 --> 01:03:36.355
<i>40-love.</i>

01:03:36.389 --> 01:03:37.556
No, Margaret.

01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:38.990
Wake up, Margaret!

01:03:39.025 --> 01:03:40.559
I'm not liking this.

01:03:40.594 --> 01:03:42.360
Gladys, I think I'm gonna
need a cigarette.

01:03:42.394 --> 01:03:44.597
Finally,
one of my girls smokes!

01:03:45.563 --> 01:03:47.231
<i>Game to Mr. Riggs.</i>

01:03:47.266 --> 01:03:48.666
<i>Mr. Riggs leads
one set to nothing.</i>

01:03:48.699 --> 01:03:50.999
There's not a single thing

01:03:50.034 --> 01:03:51.368
I don't hate about
Bobby Riggs,

01:03:51.402 --> 01:03:53.403
not a single thing.

01:03:53.438 --> 01:03:55.805
<i>Bobby Riggs
here in the second set.</i>

01:03:55.838 --> 01:03:57.239
<i>Riggs does it again.</i>

01:03:57.273 --> 01:03:59.009
<i>Bobby's unstoppable today.</i>

01:03:59.041 --> 01:04:00.543
<i>Bobby Riggs.</i>

01:04:00.577 --> 01:04:02.544
<i>Again, Bobby Riggs.</i>

01:04:02.579 --> 01:04:04.246
<i>Margaret seems to
be off her game.</i>

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:06.014
I'll say!

01:04:06.047 --> 01:04:07.248
<i>40-love. Beautiful.</i>

01:04:07.282 --> 01:04:08.415
This is awful.

01:04:08.449 --> 01:04:09.850
<i>Game to Mr. Riggs.</i>

01:04:09.885 --> 01:04:11.252
Really terrible.

01:04:11.286 --> 01:04:12.653
<i>Again, Bobby Riggs.</i>

01:04:12.686 --> 01:04:14.253
Let's get
another cocktail, Henry.

01:04:14.289 --> 01:04:16.257
<i>Well, as I said...</i>

01:04:16.291 --> 01:04:17.792
<i>...it's not that women
can't play tennis,</i>

01:04:17.826 --> 01:04:21.394
<i>it's just that they can't
deal with the pressure.</i>

01:04:21.429 --> 01:04:24.197
<i>Perhaps this will finally put
a stop to women players</i>

01:04:24.231 --> 01:04:26.933
<i>demanding the same prize
money as men.</i>

01:04:26.965 --> 01:04:29.199
<i>As we've seen today,
they're simply...</i>

01:04:29.235 --> 01:04:31.135
<i>not in the same league.</i>

01:04:31.170 --> 01:04:32.737
<i>Let's face it, in business,</i>

01:04:32.771 --> 01:04:34.672
<i>politics, sports,
you name it...</i>

01:04:34.706 --> 01:04:36.273
<i>...whatever they like
to think,</i>

01:04:36.307 --> 01:04:38.141
<i>at the very top
it's a man's game.</i>

01:04:38.175 --> 01:04:39.777
I can't believe this.

01:04:41.344 --> 01:04:43.079
I know what'll cheer her up.

01:04:44.347 --> 01:04:46.181
I'll be right back.

01:04:44.347 --> 01:04:46.181
Okay, darling.

01:04:46.215 --> 01:04:48.085
<i>We're at match point here.</i>

01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:06.067
<i>There it is.
Bobby Riggs wins 6-2, 6-1.</i>

01:05:06.099 --> 01:05:07.333
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

01:05:07.367 --> 01:05:09.235
<i>A rather easy triumph against</i>

01:05:09.269 --> 01:05:11.538
<i>motherhood
and women's liberation.</i>

01:05:14.208 --> 01:05:15.708
That was a massacre.

01:05:15.742 --> 01:05:16.776
<i>Congratulations, Bobby.</i>

01:05:16.809 --> 01:05:18.177
<i>Well, thank you very much.</i>

01:05:18.210 --> 01:05:19.443
This is my son, Larry.

01:05:19.478 --> 01:05:21.479
Lousy tennis player,
great guy.

01:05:21.512 --> 01:05:23.380
So, now officially Bobby Riggs

01:05:23.416 --> 01:05:25.450
is the number one
ladies player in the world...

01:05:25.483 --> 01:05:26.583
...and any ladies out there

01:05:26.617 --> 01:05:27.650
want to challenge
for the crown,

01:05:27.684 --> 01:05:29.353
<i>you know where to find me.</i>

01:05:29.387 --> 01:05:31.054
<i>And since I have just
proven here today,</i>

01:05:31.088 --> 01:05:32.489
<i>beyond a shadow of a doubt...</i>

01:05:32.521 --> 01:05:34.123
<i>...that men are
the superior animal,</i>

01:05:35.659 --> 01:05:37.160
<i>I am gonna triple the bet!</i>

01:05:37.193 --> 01:05:40.163
<i>$100,000 to any woman
who can beat Bobby Riggs.</i>

01:05:40.195 --> 01:05:42.463
<i>The question I ask myself is,
is she out there,</i>

01:05:42.498 --> 01:05:45.467
<i>and does she have the nerve?</i>

01:05:52.239 --> 01:05:53.940
What got into her?

01:05:53.974 --> 01:05:55.475
Fate, sweetie.

01:05:55.509 --> 01:05:58.110
Coming at her
like a runaway train.

01:06:02.148 --> 01:06:04.150
Oh... darling.

01:06:07.954 --> 01:06:09.488
<i>And in today's much publicized</i>

01:06:09.521 --> 01:06:11.222
<i>tennis face-off between...</i>

01:06:11.255 --> 01:06:12.489
<i>...Senior Pro Bobby Riggs</i>

01:06:12.523 --> 01:06:14.525
<i>and Woman's No. 1
Margaret Court...</i>

01:06:14.559 --> 01:06:16.428
<i>...the self-styled
"male chauvinist pig"</i>

01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:19.395
<i>beat Mrs. Court
in straight sets, 6-2, 6-1...</i>

01:06:19.429 --> 01:06:21.297
<i>...in what the press
has dubbed</i>

01:06:21.331 --> 01:06:22.932
<i>"The Mother's Day Massac..."</i>

01:06:22.967 --> 01:06:26.503
Oh, for goodness sakes.
It was just a tennis match.

01:06:27.737 --> 01:06:30.638
The Women's No. 1
can't beat a 55-year-old.

01:06:30.672 --> 01:06:32.772
Are you kidding me?

01:06:32.807 --> 01:06:34.242
He's backed me
into a corner now.

01:06:34.277 --> 01:06:35.543
Then don't play him.

01:06:35.577 --> 01:06:37.646
Who else is gonna
beat him, Marilyn?

01:06:37.679 --> 01:06:39.378
I don't have a choice.

01:06:39.413 --> 01:06:41.849
No, you always have a choice.

01:06:41.882 --> 01:06:43.483
You don't get it.

01:06:45.052 --> 01:06:46.653
You don't get it.

01:06:50.690 --> 01:06:52.892
I don't know how to help you.

01:06:56.728 --> 01:06:58.663
Do you even want me here?

01:07:02.733 --> 01:07:05.936
I don't know. I'm sorry.
I need to think.

01:08:20.501 --> 01:08:21.734
Hello?

01:08:21.769 --> 01:08:23.636
<i>Larry.</i>

01:08:23.670 --> 01:08:26.738
Oh. I was wondering
when you were gonna call.

01:08:30.009 --> 01:08:31.743
It was a travesty.

01:08:32.743 --> 01:08:33.746
So?

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:36.279
Call the bozo.

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:38.715
Tell him it's on.

01:08:39.850 --> 01:08:41.251
But nothing gets agreed on

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:42.917
without my approval,
all right?

01:08:42.953 --> 01:08:47.490
Venue, date,
TV rights, everything.

01:08:47.524 --> 01:08:49.792
What balls we use.

01:08:49.826 --> 01:08:52.926
I know Bobby. He'll be making
deals on his deals by now.

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:54.930
I'll call him first thing
in the morning.

01:08:54.965 --> 01:08:58.265
No, now.
He calls me at midnight.

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:00.135
If we're gonna go, let's go.

01:09:02.868 --> 01:09:04.002
Okay.

01:09:09.444 --> 01:09:11.377
You know something?

01:09:11.411 --> 01:09:13.011
This can be great.

01:09:14.145 --> 01:09:15.779
<i>Really, really great.</i>

01:09:15.814 --> 01:09:18.617
<i>And not just
for women's tennis, you know?</i>

01:09:20.417 --> 01:09:22.153
As long as I win.

01:09:24.689 --> 01:09:27.658
If there's one thing
that I know about you...

01:09:27.693 --> 01:09:31.627
...it's that this is one match
you are gonna win.

01:09:34.832 --> 01:09:36.800
You're a good man, Larry.

01:09:37.568 --> 01:09:39.202
<i>You're a good woman.</i>

01:09:41.304 --> 01:09:43.037
I wish that were true.

01:09:44.707 --> 01:09:48.310
Let's focus on the match.
Everything else can wait.

01:09:52.314 --> 01:09:53.314
Good night.

01:10:10.462 --> 01:10:11.696
Marilyn?

01:10:30.246 --> 01:10:32.246
Honey! I am back on top,

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:34.983
I've never felt better,
I beat Margaret Court...

01:10:35.016 --> 01:10:37.318
...and now I am playing
Billie Jean King

01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:39.953
for $100,000.
What about that?

01:10:39.988 --> 01:10:41.021
And...

01:10:41.055 --> 01:10:43.891
...it's going to be
on ABC, primetime.

01:10:43.925 --> 01:10:45.891
Well, you have some
nerve using all that

01:10:45.926 --> 01:10:48.495
"male chauvinist pig"
nonsense.

01:10:48.529 --> 01:10:49.729
Who do you think's
been bankrolling

01:10:49.764 --> 01:10:52.632
you all these years?
Me. A woman.

01:10:52.664 --> 01:10:54.466
You know something?
You are absolutely right,

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.333
and I am gonna pay you back.

01:10:56.368 --> 01:10:58.203
Oh, yeah?

01:10:56.368 --> 01:10:58.203
Yeah.

01:10:58.237 --> 01:10:59.837
I don't want it back.

01:11:02.106 --> 01:11:03.506
You want me back?

01:11:10.881 --> 01:11:12.280
So...

01:11:12.315 --> 01:11:15.050
<i>...I'm gonna be on the cover
of Time magazine.</i>

01:11:15.083 --> 01:11:16.152
I won the triple at Wimbledon

01:11:16.185 --> 01:11:18.019
<i>and never got
the cover of Time.</i>

01:11:19.221 --> 01:11:21.889
So after Billie Jean,
there's an offer on the table

01:11:21.922 --> 01:11:24.257
for a million dollars
to play Chrissie Evert.

01:11:24.292 --> 01:11:25.894
A million dollars, huh!

01:11:26.529 --> 01:11:27.996
Imagine that?

01:11:28.829 --> 01:11:30.430
Million dollars.

01:11:32.065 --> 01:11:33.067
Phew.

01:11:37.537 --> 01:11:39.137
I'll tell you something.

01:11:44.243 --> 01:11:48.413
It's a pretty scary trip
I'm taking right here...

01:11:48.448 --> 01:11:49.914
...and, uh...

01:11:50.948 --> 01:11:53.016
...well, I was, um...

01:11:55.418 --> 01:11:57.020
Well, I need you, honey.

01:12:01.858 --> 01:12:04.226
I feel like we've been
through this before.

01:12:04.261 --> 01:12:07.464
No, I'm a changed man.
Ask the shrink.

01:12:08.463 --> 01:12:09.564
I did.

01:12:09.599 --> 01:12:10.833
What did he say?

01:12:10.867 --> 01:12:13.936
Nothing.
He just gave me 30 bucks.

01:12:15.304 --> 01:12:16.103
The money that he owed you

01:12:16.136 --> 01:12:18.171
from your last game
of blackjack.

01:12:20.274 --> 01:12:22.575
He was a terrible player.

01:12:22.609 --> 01:12:24.310
Christ.

01:12:27.579 --> 01:12:29.448
Bobby, I love you.

01:12:30.850 --> 01:12:33.118
Well, I love you, too.

01:12:33.153 --> 01:12:36.253
I love how
you make me laugh.

01:12:36.287 --> 01:12:39.490
I love your crazy ideas
and all your schemes.

01:12:39.524 --> 01:12:43.228
And the way you walk into
a room and you fill it up.

01:12:44.496 --> 01:12:46.163
I love the way
you make me feel.

01:12:46.197 --> 01:12:48.231
I miss that a lot.

01:12:49.631 --> 01:12:51.299
But...

01:12:51.335 --> 01:12:53.734
...I need a husband.

01:12:53.770 --> 01:12:56.605
I need someone
who is steady.

01:12:56.639 --> 01:12:59.239
Someone that I can rely on.

01:12:59.274 --> 01:13:01.076
And that is not you.

01:13:01.743 --> 01:13:03.377
And that's okay.

01:13:04.511 --> 01:13:05.878
It is more than okay.

01:13:05.913 --> 01:13:08.314
It is wonderful,
because that...

01:13:08.349 --> 01:13:10.083
...is who you are.

01:13:11.751 --> 01:13:14.354
I just can't be
with that person anymore.

01:13:15.256 --> 01:13:16.823
I just can't.

01:13:18.524 --> 01:13:20.391
I'm so sorry.

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:21.960
No.

01:13:23.796 --> 01:13:25.396
I'm sorry.

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.134
Okay.

01:13:31.502 --> 01:13:32.635
All right.

01:13:32.668 --> 01:13:33.769
Okay.

01:13:33.804 --> 01:13:35.137
Good-bye.

01:14:04.597 --> 01:14:08.067
Hey, Jimmy! Bobby here.
How are you, my friend?

01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:09.300
Never better, never better.

01:14:09.333 --> 01:14:11.536
Listen, what are the odds
right now?

01:14:13.072 --> 01:14:15.907
Okay, put 15 grand
on me to win.

01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:18.509
That's right, buddy,
15 big ones.

01:14:18.542 --> 01:14:21.878
Okay. Great. Thank you, sir.

01:14:25.948 --> 01:14:27.381
<i>In other news, another battle</i>

01:14:27.417 --> 01:14:29.786
<i>in the never-ending
war of the sexes...</i>

01:14:29.819 --> 01:14:31.320
<i>...this one on
the tennis court</i>

01:14:31.354 --> 01:14:33.421
<i>for a $100,000 purse.</i>

01:14:33.456 --> 01:14:34.822
<i>It was announced today.</i>

01:14:34.856 --> 01:14:36.057
<i>Women's tennis champion</i>

01:14:36.091 --> 01:14:38.225
<i>Miss Billie Jean King,
who is 29...</i>

01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:41.695
<i>...accepted the challenge
of 55-year-old Bobby Riggs...</i>

01:14:41.729 --> 01:14:43.062
<i>...the match to be
held at a time</i>

01:14:43.096 --> 01:14:44.831
<i>and place still to be decided.</i>

01:14:44.864 --> 01:14:46.332
<i>Miss King said
she will not play</i>

01:14:46.367 --> 01:14:48.067
<i>for the money but,
in her words...</i>

01:14:48.101 --> 01:14:49.836
<i>..."to put women's tennis</i>

01:14:49.869 --> 01:14:52.337
<i>"and women's lib back
where it belongs."</i>

01:14:52.372 --> 01:14:55.106
<i>Riggs said he issued
the challenge because...</i>

01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:56.640
<i>..."I want to prove
that women are lousy</i>

01:14:56.676 --> 01:14:59.111
<i>"and they don't belong
on the same court as a man."</i>

01:14:59.744 --> 01:15:01.179
Wow.

01:15:03.581 --> 01:15:05.449
Put her there.

01:15:03.581 --> 01:15:05.449
All right, great.

01:15:08.853 --> 01:15:11.288
Now, don't get me wrong,
I love women...

01:15:11.322 --> 01:15:13.222
In the bedroom
and in the kitchen.

01:15:13.256 --> 01:15:15.024
But these days,
they want to be everywhere!

01:15:15.057 --> 01:15:16.992
They want to be
doing everything!

01:15:17.025 --> 01:15:18.527
Where is it gonna end?

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:21.229
Pretty soon us fellas won't be
able to go to a ballgame,

01:15:21.262 --> 01:15:22.630
we won't be able
to go fishing.

01:15:22.663 --> 01:15:25.265
We won't be able to stop
and have a drink after work.

01:15:25.301 --> 01:15:27.435
And that's what this whole
women's lib thing is about.

01:15:27.469 --> 01:15:28.836
And it's got to stop.

01:15:28.869 --> 01:15:30.503
And Bobby Riggs
is the man to stop it.

01:15:30.537 --> 01:15:33.305
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Custer's Last Stand.

01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:36.509
This is the Lobber
versus the Libber!

01:15:38.878 --> 01:15:40.947
Take that. Right?

01:15:41.614 --> 01:15:43.248
Keep talking, Bobby.

01:15:43.282 --> 01:15:44.716
The more nonsense you spout,

01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:46.217
the worse it will be
when you lose.

01:15:47.019 --> 01:15:48.386
Well, I'm the ladies
number one,

01:15:48.421 --> 01:15:50.722
I'm the champ.
Why would I lose?

01:15:50.755 --> 01:15:52.623
Because dinosaurs
can't play tennis.

01:15:54.324 --> 01:15:56.993
I'm gonna put the "show"
back in "chauvinism."

01:15:59.061 --> 01:16:00.363
Gentlemen.

01:16:01.899 --> 01:16:05.034
What a beautiful day
to play tennis, huh?

01:16:05.067 --> 01:16:07.502
All right, right here.
Right down the pike.

01:16:07.537 --> 01:16:09.137
All right, I'm coming in.

01:16:09.904 --> 01:16:12.974
I'm coming in! Give me a lob!

01:16:14.208 --> 01:16:16.644
Right? That's how you do it.

01:16:16.679 --> 01:16:18.779
You know what I'm doing?
I'm cooking.

01:16:18.813 --> 01:16:21.014
I'm cooking! Am I cooking?

01:16:21.548 --> 01:16:22.716
Oh...

01:16:24.418 --> 01:16:26.420
Oh, there we go!

01:16:26.786 --> 01:16:28.052
Ah!

01:16:28.087 --> 01:16:29.520
All right, I got it.

01:16:30.789 --> 01:16:32.457
<i>¶ Any time of day ¶</i>

01:16:34.193 --> 01:16:35.994
<i>¶ But if it's not love ¶</i>

01:16:37.695 --> 01:16:39.564
<i>¶ That you need ¶</i>

01:16:41.332 --> 01:16:43.334
<i>¶ Then I'll try my best... ¶</i>

01:16:43.368 --> 01:16:46.904
They walked right into it.
I'm taking 'em all home!

01:16:46.938 --> 01:16:49.305
They're gonna do my laundry.

01:16:49.338 --> 01:16:51.173
You know what it's like?
Being reincarnated.

01:16:51.207 --> 01:16:52.942
It's the greatest thing
I've ever done.

01:16:52.975 --> 01:16:54.242
It's bigger
than winning Wimbledon,

01:16:54.277 --> 01:16:56.478
bigger than Forest Hills,
bigger than the Pro Tour.

01:16:56.511 --> 01:16:58.779
High point of my career,
maybe my life.

01:16:58.814 --> 01:17:00.682
Hey, sweetie,
how about a cocktail?

01:17:00.716 --> 01:17:01.950
There we go.

01:17:01.984 --> 01:17:04.353
Oh, watch it!
I almost took your arms off.

01:17:09.091 --> 01:17:10.658
<i>I'm not saying
that women</i>

01:17:10.690 --> 01:17:11.824
<i>don't belong on the court.</i>

01:17:11.859 --> 01:17:15.461
<i>I mean, heck, who would pick
up the balls otherwise?</i>

01:17:15.494 --> 01:17:19.331
<i>But all of this shouting
and yammering about equality.</i>

01:17:19.364 --> 01:17:21.498
<i>Equality this, equality that.</i>

01:17:21.533 --> 01:17:24.202
<i>Hey, how about some equality
for Bobby Riggs?</i>

01:17:24.235 --> 01:17:27.503
This is my third
nude shoot today.

01:17:27.537 --> 01:17:30.106
I'm this old guy,
trying to make ends meet

01:17:30.141 --> 01:17:32.710
on the senior circuit,
getting paid peanuts.

01:17:32.743 --> 01:17:34.077
<i>But if I can beat the ladies</i>

01:17:34.110 --> 01:17:36.880
<i>and get equal prize money,
thank you very much...</i>

01:17:36.913 --> 01:17:38.814
...well, then all the girls
can just head back

01:17:38.849 --> 01:17:41.115
in the kitchen
where they belong.

01:17:41.150 --> 01:17:42.516
Look, he can talk
all he likes.

01:17:42.551 --> 01:17:44.486
That's one of the few things
he's good at.

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:47.523
But the only thing that
matters is who wins the match.

01:17:47.555 --> 01:17:52.460
<i>¶ Tell me, what it my life
Without your love ¶</i>

01:17:54.261 --> 01:17:59.599
<i>¶ Tell me, who am I
Without you ¶</i>

01:18:02.068 --> 01:18:03.536
<i>¶ By my side ¶</i>

01:18:07.507 --> 01:18:08.740
Bobby!

01:18:10.274 --> 01:18:12.143
Bobby, let's play
some tennis, man!

01:18:12.177 --> 01:18:14.078
Damn it, Dad.

01:18:27.056 --> 01:18:28.524
Thank you.

01:18:29.792 --> 01:18:32.160
Dad.

01:18:29.792 --> 01:18:32.160
Hey, kiddo!

01:18:32.194 --> 01:18:34.029
I thought we were practicing.

01:18:34.063 --> 01:18:35.128
You know what
I have to say to that?

01:18:35.163 --> 01:18:37.798
Margaret Court.
6-2, 6-1.

01:18:37.832 --> 01:18:40.400
I don't need to practice,
I got a secret weapon.

01:18:40.435 --> 01:18:41.668
Rheo Blair, I'd like you
to meet the most

01:18:41.703 --> 01:18:44.638
important person in my life...
apart from me.

01:18:44.671 --> 01:18:46.138
My son, Larry.

01:18:46.172 --> 01:18:47.541
You tell him, Rheo.

01:18:47.574 --> 01:18:49.775
Super Nutrition.

01:18:49.810 --> 01:18:51.411
Super Nutrition!

01:18:52.078 --> 01:18:53.479
You taking all of these?

01:18:53.512 --> 01:18:54.880
Four hundred a day!

01:18:54.914 --> 01:18:56.014
You're kidding.

01:18:56.048 --> 01:18:57.416
Yeah, I'm rattling
around a little bit,

01:18:57.449 --> 01:18:59.784
but you know what?
I feel better than ever.

01:18:59.819 --> 01:19:02.019
It's the A to Z
of amino acids.

01:19:02.052 --> 01:19:05.756
Vitamins, protein pills,
some fat busters,

01:19:05.789 --> 01:19:07.256
and some of Rheo's Specials.

01:19:07.792 --> 01:19:09.259
What's in those?

01:19:10.661 --> 01:19:12.261
Specialness.

01:19:13.563 --> 01:19:14.931
Specialness!

01:19:14.965 --> 01:19:17.565
Who needs to train?
I'm gonna live forever.

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:19.301
Yeah, but this,
I don't know...

01:19:19.336 --> 01:19:22.405
Oh, would you just relax?
Come on.

01:19:23.471 --> 01:19:25.171
You saw
what I did to Margaret,

01:19:25.207 --> 01:19:26.807
and she beat Billie Jean.

01:19:33.014 --> 01:19:34.215
One down!

01:19:35.114 --> 01:19:36.448
What's next?

01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:38.683
She played like an idiot.

01:19:38.719 --> 01:19:41.386
There's no comparison.
Margaret folds.

01:19:41.421 --> 01:19:43.990
You know Billie.
She loves pressure.

01:19:44.023 --> 01:19:46.391
Yeah, but her game's
off right now.

01:19:46.426 --> 01:19:48.060
It is. I mean,
I hate to say it,

01:19:48.094 --> 01:19:49.795
but my money's on Bobby.

01:19:49.828 --> 01:19:52.329
Yep. Mine, too.

01:19:52.363 --> 01:19:54.197
Money that you have
because of Billie Jean.

01:19:54.231 --> 01:19:56.167
It's not personal.
I don't want him to win.

01:19:56.201 --> 01:19:58.001
I just think he will.

01:20:10.046 --> 01:20:11.313
<i>I think that
if I had to bet money,</i>

01:20:11.345 --> 01:20:12.946
<i>I would bet on Bobby Riggs.</i>

01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:14.349
<i>Well, my money's
on Bobby Riggs.</i>

01:20:14.382 --> 01:20:16.083
<i>I've played with him.</i>

01:20:16.118 --> 01:20:17.618
<i>The man has
tremendous experience...</i>

01:20:17.652 --> 01:20:19.487
<i>...and the male muscle
is always a little</i>

01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:21.354
<i>stronger than
the female muscle.</i>

01:20:21.389 --> 01:20:23.355
<i>Billie Jean King.</i>

01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:24.891
You're gonna want to see this.

01:20:24.925 --> 01:20:26.025
What? Am I on?

01:20:26.059 --> 01:20:27.259
You got to check this out.

01:20:27.293 --> 01:20:29.694
<i>Billie Jean King
is an excellent player.</i>

01:20:29.729 --> 01:20:32.965
<i>I think that besides that,
she's a beautiful lady.</i>

01:20:32.997 --> 01:20:34.498
<i>And I like beautiful ladies.</i>

01:20:34.533 --> 01:20:36.234
<i>I saw Bobby beat Margaret,</i>

01:20:36.269 --> 01:20:38.369
<i>and I think that
he's a really tough player.</i>

01:20:38.404 --> 01:20:40.704
<i>So I'd have to give him
the edge over Billie Jean.</i>

01:20:40.738 --> 01:20:41.805
I like it.

01:20:41.838 --> 01:20:43.105
<i>The breaking
news from Forest Hills</i>

01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:44.374
<i>is that Billie Jean King...</i>

01:20:44.408 --> 01:20:45.842
<i>...has defaulted
in her third-round match</i>

01:20:45.877 --> 01:20:47.244
<i>against Julie Heldman.</i>

01:20:47.278 --> 01:20:49.079
<i>Looking tired and dispirited,</i>

01:20:49.113 --> 01:20:51.614
<i>Mrs. King left the court
after only one set.</i>

01:20:51.648 --> 01:20:53.115
<i>Speculation mounts
that pressure from</i>

01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:54.951
<i>the upcoming match
against Bobby Riggs...</i>

01:20:54.984 --> 01:20:56.517
<i>...is taking its toll.</i>

01:20:56.551 --> 01:20:59.720
Taking its toll, baby!
I knew it!

01:20:59.755 --> 01:21:02.690
She's crumbling,
and I'm hanging out by the pool!

01:21:03.891 --> 01:21:06.827
Are you scamming me
to get more practice time?

01:21:09.563 --> 01:21:10.997
I'm sick.

01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:12.631
Let me see that.

01:21:17.103 --> 01:21:18.936
Well, you're not dying.

01:21:18.970 --> 01:21:20.604
Try to sound pleased.

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:23.608
Look, I love
the other girls, but...

01:21:23.643 --> 01:21:25.877
...you're the draw.
You're my giant.

01:21:25.909 --> 01:21:29.447
I'm a giant with the flu.
I don't know what to say.

01:21:33.117 --> 01:21:34.617
Take two weeks off!

01:21:34.652 --> 01:21:37.353
Go somewhere,
do what you need to do, okay?

01:21:37.387 --> 01:21:38.521
But you have a tournament

01:21:38.555 --> 01:21:39.822
the day after that
match with Riggs...

01:21:39.855 --> 01:21:41.657
...and, win or lose,
you're gonna be there.

01:21:42.158 --> 01:21:43.693
Okay, thank you.

01:21:43.726 --> 01:21:45.860
And just so you know,
if you lose,

01:21:45.895 --> 01:21:47.796
I will never forgive you.

01:21:54.402 --> 01:21:56.903
Oh, Jesus, Larry.

01:21:56.938 --> 01:22:00.407
It's too much. No wonder
my body's falling apart.

01:22:09.347 --> 01:22:12.250
Okay, if there's somebody
that you need...

01:22:12.283 --> 01:22:13.884
...that you want me
to call...

01:22:15.286 --> 01:22:16.753
...I can call her.

01:22:20.826 --> 01:22:22.560
No, there's nobody.

01:22:24.561 --> 01:22:26.327
<i>And if you mistake
him for a fool,</i>

01:22:26.363 --> 01:22:28.465
<i>you may end up
looking like one yourself.</i>

01:22:28.498 --> 01:22:31.132
<i>Whether he's wearing a dress,
playing with an umbrella...</i>

01:22:31.166 --> 01:22:32.333
<i>...or sporting this season's</i>

01:22:32.368 --> 01:22:35.136
<i>must-have accessory,
a flock of sheep...</i>

01:22:35.171 --> 01:22:37.005
<i>...Bobby has not
lost a match yet.</i>

01:22:37.037 --> 01:22:40.206
<i>And as the Bobby Riggs circus
moves on to the next town...</i>

01:22:40.242 --> 01:22:41.309
<i>...people are beginning
to wonder</i>

01:22:41.342 --> 01:22:43.476
<i>what has happened
to the opposition.</i>

01:22:43.511 --> 01:22:46.614
<i>Has she choked?
Has she fled the country?</i>

01:22:46.648 --> 01:22:50.417
<i>After withdrawing from
Forest Hills with a virus, nobody...</i>

01:22:50.451 --> 01:22:53.587
<i>...has seen even the ghost
of Billie Jean King.</i>

01:22:57.056 --> 01:22:59.890
Hey! Where are you going?

01:22:59.925 --> 01:23:01.525
Where is she going?

01:23:02.328 --> 01:23:03.795
My guess?

01:23:05.662 --> 01:23:06.729
Houston.

01:23:11.402 --> 01:23:12.802
She does know
what time this is...

01:23:12.836 --> 01:23:14.537
Yes, I told you.

01:23:15.271 --> 01:23:16.972
Has she pulled out?

01:23:17.006 --> 01:23:18.440
She was ill.

01:23:22.110 --> 01:23:24.045
Sorry I'm late, gentlemen.

01:23:24.079 --> 01:23:26.047
Hey, honey, how's the flu?

01:23:26.082 --> 01:23:27.782
Flu?

01:23:26.082 --> 01:23:27.782
I heard you were ill.

01:23:27.814 --> 01:23:30.583
No. Don't believe everything
you read in the papers, Bobby.

01:23:30.618 --> 01:23:33.053
But thank you for the flowers.
I gave 'em to Rosie.

01:23:33.087 --> 01:23:34.453
And I put 'em
in the trash.

01:23:34.488 --> 01:23:36.856
Oh.

01:23:36.890 --> 01:23:38.024
Billie Jean.

01:23:38.824 --> 01:23:39.826
Jack.

01:23:41.293 --> 01:23:43.729
What are you doing here?

01:23:43.761 --> 01:23:46.197
Jack's my choice
of commentator for ABC.

01:23:46.231 --> 01:23:47.432
Jack?

01:23:48.368 --> 01:23:49.801
Oh, that won't work.

01:23:49.835 --> 01:23:51.502
Now, Billie Jean,
no one's complaining

01:23:51.536 --> 01:23:53.237
about Rosie doing
the play-by-play.

01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:54.771
Well, Rosie hasn't continually

01:23:54.805 --> 01:23:56.473
tried to dismantle
women's tennis.

01:23:57.774 --> 01:24:00.277
You overstate
my influence, Billie Jean.

01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:03.345
You blackballed us
from the USLTA, Jack.

01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:05.414
We did you a favor.
Lousy organization.

01:24:05.448 --> 01:24:06.748
Jack's my choice.

01:24:06.782 --> 01:24:09.051
Sure make for
a punchy commentator.

01:24:13.722 --> 01:24:15.221
I won't play.

01:24:15.256 --> 01:24:18.391
Look, I just spent $750,000
on this event.

01:24:18.426 --> 01:24:20.494
You can't pull out
the day before the match!

01:24:21.261 --> 01:24:22.729
Says who?

01:24:23.264 --> 01:24:24.465
Say...

01:24:25.399 --> 01:24:27.433
...I wonder if we could...

01:24:27.466 --> 01:24:29.801
...have a word,
just the two of us.

01:24:42.012 --> 01:24:43.380
Billie Jean...

01:24:43.413 --> 01:24:45.148
...I know we've had
our differences,

01:24:45.182 --> 01:24:48.284
but that's behind us.

01:24:48.318 --> 01:24:50.587
This is between you
and Bobby now.

01:24:50.621 --> 01:24:51.621
Bobby?

01:24:52.355 --> 01:24:54.791
Oh, Bobby's a clown.

01:24:54.823 --> 01:24:56.724
This whole thing's
an act for him, Jack.

01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:58.458
You know that.

01:24:58.493 --> 01:25:01.529
With you it's different.
It's for real.

01:25:01.564 --> 01:25:03.030
What do you mean?

01:25:05.634 --> 01:25:07.768
I don't think
you respect women.

01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:11.871
I've been happily married
for 32 years.

01:25:11.905 --> 01:25:14.873
No, I think you like us in
the kitchen and the bedroom.

01:25:14.908 --> 01:25:17.476
I think you are a gentleman,
and I mean that.

01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:19.078
Thank you.
I'll take my compliments

01:25:19.112 --> 01:25:20.878
where I can from you.

01:25:20.913 --> 01:25:23.849
It's when we dare
to want a little bit more.

01:25:24.850 --> 01:25:27.118
Just a little bit
of what you've got.

01:25:28.052 --> 01:25:30.153
That's what you can't stand.

01:25:30.188 --> 01:25:31.355
Oh. Really?

01:25:31.389 --> 01:25:32.956
Yeah.

01:25:32.989 --> 01:25:34.623
And to have you telling
the American public

01:25:34.658 --> 01:25:36.794
what to read
into every serve?

01:25:37.328 --> 01:25:38.796
Every point?

01:25:41.265 --> 01:25:42.331
I'm sorry, Jack.

01:25:42.364 --> 01:25:44.367
If you're commentating,
I'm not playing.

01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:45.501
How do you think
that's gonna make

01:25:45.534 --> 01:25:47.501
the great Billie
Jean King look?

01:25:47.536 --> 01:25:48.636
Backing out
at the last minute

01:25:48.670 --> 01:25:51.306
just because she didn't
like the commentator?

01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:52.472
I think it's pretty
similar to how

01:25:52.507 --> 01:25:55.108
it'll make the great
Jack Kramer look.

01:25:55.141 --> 01:25:56.376
Shutting the whole thing down

01:25:56.411 --> 01:25:58.546
because he didn't
get to participate.

01:26:00.346 --> 01:26:03.114
No. That's not gonna happen.

01:26:03.149 --> 01:26:04.849
You're not gonna do this.

01:26:04.885 --> 01:26:08.253
This means too much to you.
You and your Sisterhood.

01:26:08.287 --> 01:26:09.653
You'd never throw it

01:26:09.688 --> 01:26:11.056
over something like this.
You won't.

01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:14.159
Do you remember the last time
you thought I was bluffing?

01:26:14.893 --> 01:26:16.159
One dollar.

01:26:21.565 --> 01:26:22.666
You know
the difference between

01:26:22.699 --> 01:26:24.800
a good player and a great?

01:26:24.836 --> 01:26:28.471
The great players never let
emotion get in the way.

01:26:28.506 --> 01:26:30.707
It messes with their game.

01:26:41.248 --> 01:26:42.716
Sorry, Bobby.

01:26:49.055 --> 01:26:50.623
<i>Any last
minute thoughts, Billie Jean?</i>

01:26:50.658 --> 01:26:52.225
<i>Are you going to win?</i>

01:26:52.259 --> 01:26:53.625
Of course she's gonna win.

01:26:53.659 --> 01:26:55.560
Against an old guy
like Bobby Riggs, sure.

01:26:55.595 --> 01:26:58.297
Let her play Rosewall
or Nastase.

01:26:58.329 --> 01:27:00.564
Men are better.
End of story.

01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:02.233
I'm not saying
women are better.

01:27:02.266 --> 01:27:03.568
I've never said that.

01:27:03.601 --> 01:27:06.170
I'm saying
we deserve some respect.

01:27:06.203 --> 01:27:08.704
More than Bobby Riggs
or you are giving us.

01:27:08.738 --> 01:27:10.572
Sir, do you have a daughter?

01:27:10.608 --> 01:27:13.110
Or a sister? You sure as heck
have a mother.

01:27:13.143 --> 01:27:14.676
Is your father better
than your mother?

01:27:14.711 --> 01:27:16.679
Just because he's a man?
Do you believe that?

01:27:17.081 --> 01:27:17.913
No.

01:27:17.948 --> 01:27:19.382
But that's what
you're saying...

01:27:19.416 --> 01:27:20.783
whether you think
you are or not.

01:27:20.815 --> 01:27:23.784
If I beat Bobby Riggs,
will you stop saying it?

01:27:23.819 --> 01:27:24.851
Okay.

01:27:24.886 --> 01:27:26.853
Sir, I'm gonna
hold you to that.

01:27:26.889 --> 01:27:28.856
If I see you,
I'm gonna hold you to that.

01:27:28.890 --> 01:27:30.191
Thank you.
That's it for today.

01:27:30.225 --> 01:27:31.826
We'll see you at the match.

01:28:17.332 --> 01:28:18.465
Let's get this show
on the road.

01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:19.934
Here you go, Bobby.

01:28:32.179 --> 01:28:34.746
Dad?

01:28:32.179 --> 01:28:34.746
Yeah?

01:28:34.779 --> 01:28:36.981
I'm just gonna
watch it here.

01:28:39.051 --> 01:28:42.420
What do you mean?
This is it. This is the day.

01:28:42.453 --> 01:28:44.255
I'm sorry. I'm...

01:28:45.155 --> 01:28:46.623
...I'm not coming.

01:28:49.192 --> 01:28:51.761
You don't think I'm gonna
lose, do you, kiddo?

01:28:51.795 --> 01:28:52.628
No.

01:28:52.662 --> 01:28:56.231
You'll do great.
You don't need me.

01:28:56.265 --> 01:28:57.732
Good luck, Dad.

01:29:04.872 --> 01:29:06.639
This one's from
Jennifer in Tucson.

01:29:06.675 --> 01:29:09.377
"Good luck, Billie Jean,
we're all rooting for you."

01:29:09.409 --> 01:29:10.710
This one's from Annie
from New York.

01:29:10.744 --> 01:29:12.112
"Go, Billie,
we know you're gonna win."

01:29:12.145 --> 01:29:14.646
You've lost weight.
I have to take this in.

01:29:14.681 --> 01:29:16.782
We don't have time.

01:29:14.681 --> 01:29:16.782
We have time.

01:29:16.815 --> 01:29:17.983
How you feeling, honey?

01:29:18.018 --> 01:29:19.451
Do you need anything?
Water?

01:29:19.484 --> 01:29:20.752
No, I'm good, thank you.

01:29:20.787 --> 01:29:22.186
Twenty minutes to game time.

01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:25.090
Rosie Casals,
they need you in the studio.

01:29:26.291 --> 01:29:27.759
You're gonna kill him.

01:29:28.894 --> 01:29:30.261
I'll see you guys in a bit.

01:29:30.296 --> 01:29:31.595
Good luck out there.

01:29:31.628 --> 01:29:34.198
Now, I have to ask,
do you really intend to

01:29:34.231 --> 01:29:36.332
inflict blue suede shoes...

01:29:36.367 --> 01:29:38.935
...on ninety million members
of the viewing public?

01:29:38.969 --> 01:29:41.403
How many? Oh, my God.
Billie Jean!

01:29:41.438 --> 01:29:42.505
If they're good enough
for Elvis,

01:29:42.538 --> 01:29:43.872
they're good enough for me.

01:29:43.907 --> 01:29:46.275
Well, something's off.

01:29:46.307 --> 01:29:48.609
And I think it's the shoes.

01:29:46.307 --> 01:29:48.609
It's not the shoes!

01:29:48.644 --> 01:29:50.045
Your hair?

01:29:55.984 --> 01:29:58.485
Mom, Dad, this is Marilyn.

01:29:58.520 --> 01:29:59.686
My hairdresser.

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:02.688
Pleased to meet you.

01:30:02.721 --> 01:30:04.823
Well, if there's one thing
I know, it's...

01:30:04.859 --> 01:30:07.794
...never get between a woman
and her hairdresser.

01:30:07.827 --> 01:30:09.494
Very funny. Yes indeed.

01:30:09.528 --> 01:30:11.363
Come on.
Let's find our seats.

01:30:11.396 --> 01:30:13.332
Here. I'll take you up there.

01:30:17.668 --> 01:30:18.869
Good luck.

01:30:19.270 --> 01:30:20.369
Thank you.

01:30:20.404 --> 01:30:21.871
Yeah, give 'em heck.

01:30:21.904 --> 01:30:24.373
Billie Jean, I'll be back
to take you to the court.

01:30:24.408 --> 01:30:25.409
All right.

01:30:28.345 --> 01:30:30.213
Hi.

01:30:28.345 --> 01:30:30.213
Hi.

01:30:33.882 --> 01:30:35.885
Your hairdresser, huh?

01:30:38.287 --> 01:30:39.587
What was I supposed to say?

01:30:39.621 --> 01:30:41.021
No, you're right.

01:30:42.158 --> 01:30:43.758
That's why I'm here.

01:30:47.094 --> 01:30:48.862
Come on.

01:30:48.895 --> 01:30:52.532
Yeah, just like that.
That looks great.

01:30:52.564 --> 01:30:55.268
Yep, zip her up. Oh, boy!

01:30:55.301 --> 01:30:57.435
We need the "Sugar Daddy"
facing camera.

01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:59.337
Mmm-hmm.

01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:59.337
We got to see that.

01:30:59.371 --> 01:31:01.472
Do you want me to hold it
from the stick?

01:31:01.506 --> 01:31:03.407
Uh...

01:31:01.506 --> 01:31:03.407
Am I gonna hold it that way?

01:31:03.442 --> 01:31:05.141
That looks great.

01:31:05.176 --> 01:31:07.877
We're trying to prepare
for the match.

01:31:07.912 --> 01:31:09.713
So the camera can see it.

01:31:09.747 --> 01:31:11.681
Yeah, up high.
Beautiful.

01:31:11.716 --> 01:31:14.018
I'll get it up
nice and high.

01:31:14.051 --> 01:31:16.085
We got it. Thank you.

01:31:14.051 --> 01:31:16.085
Have a great match.

01:31:16.119 --> 01:31:18.988
Thank you. Thank you,
ladies. See you out there.

01:31:19.988 --> 01:31:23.023
See you out there.
Good work.

01:31:23.057 --> 01:31:24.926
Do it for the men, Bobby.

01:31:25.395 --> 01:31:26.728
Wow. You good?

01:31:26.761 --> 01:31:28.229
Yeah! I'm ready for battle.

01:31:28.262 --> 01:31:31.431
Stand by, Howard.
We are live in five...

01:31:31.466 --> 01:31:34.068
...four...three...

01:31:36.938 --> 01:31:40.306
<i>The following
is an exclusive presentation</i>

01:31:40.341 --> 01:31:41.441
<i>of ABC Sports.</i>

01:31:41.475 --> 01:31:44.910
<i>Live from the Astrodome
in Houston, Texas...</i>

01:31:44.944 --> 01:31:47.179
<i>...the Tennis Battle
of the Sexes,</i>

01:31:47.212 --> 01:31:50.782
<i>Billie Jean King
vs. Bobby Riggs.</i>

01:31:50.815 --> 01:31:52.315
<i>What a scene it is!</i>

01:31:52.350 --> 01:31:53.716
<i>The Houston Astrodome...</i>

01:31:53.752 --> 01:31:55.386
<i>...where up till now
they've played</i>

01:31:55.420 --> 01:31:59.123
<i>almost every sport
in the world except tennis.</i>

01:31:59.157 --> 01:32:02.259
<i>But in this panoramic scene,
a happening.</i>

01:32:02.292 --> 01:32:03.826
<i>With the big band here,</i>

01:32:03.859 --> 01:32:07.128
<i>with dancing cheerleaders,
and all of the rest.</i>

01:32:07.162 --> 01:32:09.163
<i>It's hard to believe,
but probably</i>

01:32:09.198 --> 01:32:12.434
<i>more than 30,000 people
are in this arena...</i>

01:32:12.467 --> 01:32:14.635
<i>...for an all-time-record
tennis audience</i>

01:32:14.670 --> 01:32:16.369
<i>anywhere in the world.</i>

01:32:29.048 --> 01:32:31.417
And zoom in on five.

01:32:31.451 --> 01:32:32.819
Is that a priest?

01:32:32.851 --> 01:32:35.153
Yeah. If Bobby wins,
she takes the groom's surname.

01:32:35.188 --> 01:32:37.655
But if Billie Jean wins,
the groom takes her name.

01:32:37.689 --> 01:32:41.960
Little flip-flop. Oh, boy.

01:32:41.993 --> 01:32:43.427
Where's Billie Jean?

01:32:43.461 --> 01:32:44.528
Can somebody...

01:32:44.563 --> 01:32:46.396
Does anybody know
where she is?

01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:49.098
What do you mean,
you lost her?

01:32:49.131 --> 01:32:51.867
She's getting a trim.
She'll be right out.

01:32:52.536 --> 01:32:54.069
Yeah, like a haircut.

01:33:12.554 --> 01:33:14.020
I missed you.

01:33:17.090 --> 01:33:18.090
I know.

01:33:24.162 --> 01:33:26.431
Uh, ten minutes to game time!

01:33:30.969 --> 01:33:32.569
Stay for the match?

01:33:35.105 --> 01:33:37.173
Are you sure?

01:33:35.105 --> 01:33:37.173
Yes.

01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:39.309
Please.

01:33:43.046 --> 01:33:44.981
<i>There was, would you believe,
a problem</i>

01:33:45.014 --> 01:33:47.148
<i>about one of
our announcers to be:</i>

01:33:47.181 --> 01:33:49.717
<i>Jack Kramer.
The famed tennis promoter.</i>

01:33:49.752 --> 01:33:51.920
<i>The famed tennis player
of the past.</i>

01:33:51.953 --> 01:33:54.255
<i>We wanted Jack Kramer.
We respected him.</i>

01:33:54.288 --> 01:33:56.088
<i>He would have been
on our telecast.</i>

01:33:56.123 --> 01:33:58.492
Roll the Jack Kramer clip.

01:33:58.525 --> 01:34:00.394
Billie Jean's gonna love this!

01:34:00.426 --> 01:34:02.429
<i>I want to make
one thing clear.</i>

01:34:02.462 --> 01:34:04.963
<i>When I realized that
I was perhaps a problem...</i>

01:34:04.997 --> 01:34:06.398
<i>...I thought maybe Billie Jean</i>

01:34:06.432 --> 01:34:08.234
<i>would want to use me
as an excuse...</i>

01:34:08.268 --> 01:34:10.202
<i>...if she lost
against Bobby Riggs.</i>

01:34:10.869 --> 01:34:12.704
<i>To ABC's credit...</i>

01:34:12.738 --> 01:34:14.438
<i>...they said,
"You call the shots, Jack,</i>

01:34:14.472 --> 01:34:15.905
<i>"we'll go along with you."</i>

01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:18.242
<i>But I'm withdrawing
voluntarily...</i>

01:34:18.277 --> 01:34:19.644
<i>...and I'm wishing</i>

01:34:19.677 --> 01:34:22.378
<i>a hundred percent good luck
to my pal, Bobby Riggs.</i>

01:34:22.412 --> 01:34:25.380
<i>Okay, Jack, you know
how much we respect you.</i>

01:34:25.414 --> 01:34:27.917
They are ready for you
in the holding area.

01:34:27.951 --> 01:34:29.552
I'll walk you
down there.

01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:33.022
I think I'm gonna go
on my own.

01:34:33.957 --> 01:34:36.025
Okay?

01:34:33.957 --> 01:34:36.025
Yeah.

01:35:11.189 --> 01:35:13.591
The package
is in the room.

01:35:20.796 --> 01:35:23.365
Billie! Billie Jean!

01:35:23.399 --> 01:35:24.666
This is for you.

01:35:26.202 --> 01:35:28.570
All right.

01:35:28.604 --> 01:35:30.070
Gentlemen, let's go.

01:35:46.686 --> 01:35:48.287
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:35:48.319 --> 01:35:51.255
<i>the Battle of the Sexes
is about to begin.</i>

01:35:51.288 --> 01:35:53.724
<i>Introducing six-time
Wimbledon champion...</i>

01:35:53.759 --> 01:35:56.394
<i>...four-time women's champion
of the United States...</i>

01:35:56.426 --> 01:35:59.128
<i>...winner of the Grand Slam
of women's tennis...</i>

01:35:59.163 --> 01:36:01.331
<i>Billie Jean King!</i>

01:36:30.189 --> 01:36:32.591
<i>There is
an overwhelming sentiment</i>

01:36:32.625 --> 01:36:34.292
<i>for Billie Jean King.</i>

01:36:34.327 --> 01:36:36.161
<i>Very attractive young lady...</i>

01:36:36.194 --> 01:36:37.862
<i>...and sometimes
you get the feeling</i>

01:36:37.896 --> 01:36:40.097
<i>that if she ever
let her hair grow...</i>

01:36:40.131 --> 01:36:41.565
<i>...and took her glasses off,</i>

01:36:41.599 --> 01:36:45.203
<i>you'd have somebody vying
for a Hollywood screen test.</i>

01:36:45.237 --> 01:36:47.136
<i>Oh! Here comes Bobby Riggs.</i>

01:36:45.237 --> 01:36:47.136
Ah.

01:36:47.171 --> 01:36:49.972
<i>You see him now
in the picture.</i>

01:36:50.006 --> 01:36:51.173
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:36:51.207 --> 01:36:53.308
<i>please welcome
Grand Slam champion...</i>

01:36:53.344 --> 01:36:57.313
<i>...and Tennis Hall of Famer,
Bobby Riggs!</i>

01:36:58.515 --> 01:37:00.015
<i>A long-awaited match,</i>

01:37:00.050 --> 01:37:01.449
<i>hustled and promoted...</i>

01:37:01.484 --> 01:37:05.519
<i>...ceaselessly and shrewdly
by Bobby Riggs.</i>

01:37:05.554 --> 01:37:06.554
<i>There's Bobby.</i>

01:37:06.588 --> 01:37:10.256
<i>The big act, the big bluster,
the big noise.</i>

01:37:10.291 --> 01:37:12.125
<i>Now he's got
steeper competition</i>

01:37:12.158 --> 01:37:14.126
<i>with Billie Jean King.</i>

01:37:14.162 --> 01:37:16.863
This thing is nuts.

01:37:16.896 --> 01:37:20.265
<i>All right, we're back
on camera and this is our...</i>

01:37:20.300 --> 01:37:22.735
<i>...female expert tonight.
Recognize her?</i>

01:37:22.768 --> 01:37:24.735
<i>Little Rosie Casals.</i>

01:37:24.770 --> 01:37:27.738
<i>Now, you say Billie Jean
will win in three sets?</i>

01:37:27.773 --> 01:37:29.007
<i>Yes, I definitely think so.</i>

01:37:29.041 --> 01:37:30.542
<i>I think she's
a better tennis player...</i>

01:37:30.574 --> 01:37:32.876
<i>...and I think what happened
with the Court and Riggs match</i>

01:37:32.909 --> 01:37:34.476
<i>will not happen tonight.</i>

01:37:34.511 --> 01:37:36.980
<i>Billie Jean will beat him,
definitely.</i>

01:37:37.015 --> 01:37:38.682
Well, I got this
beautiful lollipop

01:37:38.715 --> 01:37:40.114
for Billie Jean.

01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:43.051
I figure she's gonna be
a sucker for my lob.

01:37:43.087 --> 01:37:45.521
I got something for you too,
Bobby, actually.

01:37:45.555 --> 01:37:48.289
It's the ultimate gift
for a male chauvinist.

01:37:49.024 --> 01:37:50.824
Ugh...

01:37:50.859 --> 01:37:52.594
There you go.

01:37:53.795 --> 01:37:55.061
Oh, that's okay,
that's okay.

01:37:55.096 --> 01:37:57.130
Any last words
before the match, Bobby?

01:37:57.164 --> 01:37:58.532
Well, this match
is for all the guys

01:37:58.565 --> 01:38:00.266
around the world
that feel as I do...

01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:02.601
...that the male is king,
the male is supreme.

01:38:03.737 --> 01:38:04.804
Billie Jean?

01:38:04.837 --> 01:38:06.938
I'm done talking.
Let's play.

01:38:06.972 --> 01:38:08.340
Oh!

01:38:08.375 --> 01:38:09.507
Ooh!

01:38:44.805 --> 01:38:47.106
<i>They have started the match.</i>

01:38:47.140 --> 01:38:49.342
<i>Service, Billie Jean.</i>

01:38:53.079 --> 01:38:54.646
<i>Love-15.</i>

01:38:54.681 --> 01:38:55.914
Bobby.

01:38:55.949 --> 01:38:58.150
Make us some money.

01:38:55.949 --> 01:38:58.150
That a boy.

01:39:01.287 --> 01:39:03.121
<i>This match, of course,</i>

01:39:03.155 --> 01:39:05.756
<i>is going by satellite
all around the world.</i>

01:39:11.029 --> 01:39:13.331
<i>15-all.</i>

01:39:13.363 --> 01:39:15.463
<i>And you'll hear the crowd
responding all night</i>

01:39:15.498 --> 01:39:18.434
<i>to every point
won by Billie Jean.</i>

01:39:31.712 --> 01:39:33.146
Attagirl.

01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:34.481
<i>Bobby's already starting.</i>

01:39:34.515 --> 01:39:37.150
<i>Shouted "Attagirl" right after
Billie hit the winner.</i>

01:39:37.184 --> 01:39:38.351
<i>When he starts losing,</i>

01:39:38.386 --> 01:39:39.953
<i>I don't think
he's gonna say "Attagirl".</i>

01:39:39.988 --> 01:39:42.222
He's confident.

01:39:42.255 --> 01:39:44.088
<i>Not everybody
is for Billie Jean.</i>

01:39:44.123 --> 01:39:45.490
<i>Some are for</i>

01:39:45.524 --> 01:39:47.558
<i>the self-proclaimed
male chauvinist.</i>

01:39:47.594 --> 01:39:50.762
<i>What he has to lose
if he loses this match!</i>

01:39:50.796 --> 01:39:52.097
<i>He'll have to go back</i>

01:39:52.131 --> 01:39:54.164
<i>to cooking and doing
the housework.</i>

01:39:55.399 --> 01:39:56.965
<i>Game, Billie Jean King,</i>

01:39:57.001 --> 01:39:59.436
<i>and the crowd loves it.</i>

01:39:59.470 --> 01:40:02.172
<i>They're getting ready
to exchange courts.</i>

01:40:02.206 --> 01:40:05.543
<i>Billie Jean leads
one game to love.</i>

01:40:07.743 --> 01:40:10.578
Bobby, you got to take
that damn jacket off.

01:40:10.613 --> 01:40:12.447
They gave me twenty G's.
I got to keep it on.

01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:14.282
I don't care,
you've got to take it off.

01:40:29.162 --> 01:40:31.463
<i>Nicely placed by Bobby Riggs.</i>

01:40:31.497 --> 01:40:33.364
<i>I think she's too
tentative at the moment.</i>

01:40:33.399 --> 01:40:35.200
<i>That's really the problem.</i>

01:40:35.234 --> 01:40:37.102
<i>What is her overall strategy?</i>

01:40:37.136 --> 01:40:38.804
<i>You're so close to her.</i>

01:40:38.837 --> 01:40:40.005
<i>Well, psychologically</i>

01:40:40.037 --> 01:40:41.672
<i>she's a better
pressure player.</i>

01:40:41.707 --> 01:40:43.841
<i>Billie Jean's basically
like another Bobby Riggs.</i>

01:40:43.875 --> 01:40:45.076
<i>She's a hustler.</i>

01:40:45.109 --> 01:40:46.509
<i>She can take
that type of pressure</i>

01:40:46.542 --> 01:40:48.210
<i>and give the same stuff
back to him.</i>

01:40:48.246 --> 01:40:49.613
Still no Riggs.

01:40:49.646 --> 01:40:51.346
Right.

01:40:51.381 --> 01:40:53.583
<i>We're at 40-15.</i>

01:41:00.590 --> 01:41:02.692
<i>Fun to see the old man
run for that one.</i>

01:41:02.725 --> 01:41:05.360
<i>If Billie Jean
can keep Bobby running,</i>

01:41:05.394 --> 01:41:08.096
<i>I think she could
wear him down.</i>

01:41:08.128 --> 01:41:12.431
<i>Hence, the jacket begins to be
taken off by Bobby Riggs...</i>

01:41:12.466 --> 01:41:16.368
<i>...and maybe the braggadocio
a little bit reduced.</i>

01:41:16.402 --> 01:41:18.436
<i>A concession to the fact
that Riggs...</i>

01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:22.375
<i>...perhaps knows he's running
into firm competition.</i>

01:41:22.408 --> 01:41:23.975
<i>I think he's gonna
start taking</i>

01:41:24.010 --> 01:41:25.443
<i>some of the vitamin pills.</i>

01:41:25.476 --> 01:41:27.479
<i>He's gonna start needing them.</i>

01:41:34.819 --> 01:41:37.788
<i>Game point for Bobby.</i>

01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:39.721
<i>Rosie, she looks tense to me.</i>

01:41:39.756 --> 01:41:41.423
<i>She is tense.
No doubt about that.</i>

01:41:41.457 --> 01:41:43.058
<i>This is
a very important match.</i>

01:41:45.694 --> 01:41:49.163
<i>And Bobby Riggs
breaks through.</i>

01:41:49.198 --> 01:41:52.201
<i>The first perhaps
turning point in...</i>

01:41:52.234 --> 01:41:54.468
<i>...the first set
of this match.</i>

01:41:54.502 --> 01:41:57.404
<i>Bobby Riggs leading
Billie Jean King.</i>

01:41:57.438 --> 01:41:58.872
<i>He had the pressure on him.</i>

01:41:58.905 --> 01:42:01.006
<i>He responded very well.</i>

01:42:01.042 --> 01:42:03.342
<i>And Billie Jean
did not respond well</i>

01:42:03.377 --> 01:42:05.812
<i>on that shot.
Advantage to Bobby Riggs.</i>

01:42:05.845 --> 01:42:06.912
Attaboy.

01:42:18.923 --> 01:42:21.359
<i>Marvelous shot by Bobby...</i>

01:42:21.391 --> 01:42:25.162
<i>...and a great quick swing
by Billie Jean.</i>

01:42:25.195 --> 01:42:28.631
<i>Billie answering great.
She did what she had to do...</i>

01:42:28.664 --> 01:42:31.400
<i>...and she did it
her way, Gene.</i>

01:42:34.203 --> 01:42:36.471
<i>And a great shot
by Bobby Riggs.</i>

01:42:51.851 --> 01:42:53.086
<i>There it is.</i>

01:42:53.119 --> 01:42:56.255
<i>And the first
set goes to Billie Jean King.</i>

01:42:56.289 --> 01:42:58.257
<i>Point and set.</i>

01:42:58.291 --> 01:43:00.458
<i>The women in this arena
are standing</i>

01:43:00.493 --> 01:43:03.529
<i>and cheering
for Billie Jean King.</i>

01:43:03.563 --> 01:43:05.530
<i>Bobby doesn't
look very happy.</i>

01:43:05.564 --> 01:43:07.798
<i>He's sort of walking
with his head down.</i>

01:43:07.832 --> 01:43:09.533
<i>I think he's gonna get
a little strategy</i>

01:43:09.568 --> 01:43:11.802
<i>from his coach over there.</i>

01:43:11.836 --> 01:43:14.404
<i>They have
a four-minute break, Howard.</i>

01:43:14.438 --> 01:43:16.372
<i>I suppose
we all expected to have</i>

01:43:16.405 --> 01:43:18.475
<i>some high humor
involved in it.</i>

01:43:18.509 --> 01:43:19.809
<i>Instead, it seems
to have become</i>

01:43:19.841 --> 01:43:22.277
<i>a very, very serious thing,
because...</i>

01:43:22.311 --> 01:43:25.046
<i>...the comedy has gone out
of Bobby Riggs.</i>

01:43:29.184 --> 01:43:32.152
<i>The second game of the second
set has just begun...</i>

01:43:32.186 --> 01:43:33.421
<i>...Bobby Riggs serving,</i>

01:43:33.453 --> 01:43:35.487
<i>having broken through
Billie Jean King...</i>

01:43:35.523 --> 01:43:39.693
<i>...one game to none
in favor of Bobby Riggs.</i>

01:43:39.726 --> 01:43:42.595
<i>And Billie Jean is seeking
to strike back.</i>

01:43:52.570 --> 01:43:53.805
<i>Billie Jean is killing him</i>

01:43:53.838 --> 01:43:55.907
<i>with that overhand smash,
I'll tell you that.</i>

01:43:55.940 --> 01:43:58.509
<i>Bobby suddenly has
become an underdog, Howard.</i>

01:43:58.542 --> 01:44:00.478
<i>Yes,
some of them are cheering for him.</i>

01:44:05.481 --> 01:44:06.782
<i>Beautiful.</i>

01:44:08.351 --> 01:44:10.787
<i>Billie Jean King...</i>

01:44:10.819 --> 01:44:14.322
<i>...has won the second set,
six games to three.</i>

01:44:14.355 --> 01:44:16.858
<i>She leads two sets to love...</i>

01:44:16.890 --> 01:44:20.927
<i>...and it's so far a very
great night for the ladies.</i>

01:44:20.962 --> 01:44:23.730
<i>Bobby Riggs is fighting
for his tennis life.</i>

01:44:23.765 --> 01:44:26.200
<i>She's filled
with confidence now.</i>

01:44:26.234 --> 01:44:27.365
<i>Great shot!</i>

01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:29.135
<i>Marvelous shot!</i>

01:44:29.170 --> 01:44:31.404
<i>Bobby trails
four games to two.</i>

01:44:31.436 --> 01:44:34.006
<i>No question about it,
Billie Jean has been</i>

01:44:34.039 --> 01:44:36.207
<i>the aggressor in this match.</i>

01:44:36.242 --> 01:44:37.342
<i>I think we're having</i>

01:44:37.377 --> 01:44:38.810
<i>a little problem
with his hand.</i>

01:44:38.842 --> 01:44:40.478
<i>He keeps pulling
on his fingers,</i>

01:44:40.511 --> 01:44:43.280
<i>and to me that says
he's getting a cramp.</i>

01:44:43.314 --> 01:44:44.348
<i>He's having the hand</i>

01:44:44.382 --> 01:44:45.748
<i>and the arm looked at.</i>

01:44:45.783 --> 01:44:46.884
<i>Is this an injury then?</i>

01:44:46.917 --> 01:44:48.417
<i>This is an injury.</i>

01:44:48.452 --> 01:44:50.753
<i>Five minutes delay
for an injury.</i>

01:44:50.788 --> 01:44:53.090
<i>I knew it would come
to this. I knew...</i>

01:44:53.122 --> 01:44:55.690
<i>...Bobby would have
to come down to something.</i>

01:44:55.725 --> 01:44:57.125
<i>Like injuries.</i>

01:44:57.159 --> 01:44:59.427
<i>Let me say this
about Bobby Riggs, Rosie.</i>

01:44:59.462 --> 01:45:01.764
<i>You've gotten in
all your licks tonight</i>

01:45:01.796 --> 01:45:03.297
<i>at the guy, and that's fine.</i>

01:45:03.332 --> 01:45:07.568
<i>And he made a lot of noise
about male chauvinism and...</i>

01:45:07.603 --> 01:45:09.103
<i>...the women belonged
in the kitchen,</i>

01:45:09.136 --> 01:45:10.569
<i>and all the rest.</i>

01:45:10.604 --> 01:45:14.340
<i>But he is 55,
and he's some kind of guy.</i>

01:45:14.375 --> 01:45:15.708
<i>I agree.
But I don't think</i>

01:45:15.742 --> 01:45:17.009
<i>he belongs on the court...</i>

01:45:17.042 --> 01:45:19.578
<i>...with somebody
of Billie Jean's caliber.</i>

01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:22.114
<i>Well, the way it's proving</i>

01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:23.649
<i>out at the moment...</i>

01:45:23.681 --> 01:45:25.516
<i>...turns out
that you are right,</i>

01:45:25.551 --> 01:45:28.987
<i>if it ends this way.</i>

01:45:29.021 --> 01:45:33.257
<i>Okay, Bobby's ready to serve,
trailing in the third set.</i>

01:45:33.291 --> 01:45:35.092
Here we go, Bobby,
what do you say?

01:45:38.028 --> 01:45:39.162
Attaboy!

01:45:40.096 --> 01:45:41.530
<i>15-love.</i>

01:45:41.564 --> 01:45:45.100
<i>One of the fans yelling,
"Come on, Bobby baby!"</i>

01:45:46.168 --> 01:45:47.869
<i>Bobby wins that point...</i>

01:45:47.904 --> 01:45:51.139
<i>...as he starts his fight
to break through Billie Jean.</i>

01:45:51.173 --> 01:45:55.609
<i>Bobby Riggs fights back
and breaks through!</i>

01:45:55.644 --> 01:45:57.011
<i>Whether he had
the hand cramp</i>

01:45:57.046 --> 01:45:58.346
<i>earlier or not...</i>

01:45:58.380 --> 01:46:00.081
<i>...what he obviously
was trying to do</i>

01:46:00.113 --> 01:46:02.548
<i>was break up Billie Jean's
brilliant momentum.</i>

01:46:02.582 --> 01:46:04.783
<i>Mmm-hmm. Great shot.</i>

01:46:04.818 --> 01:46:06.019
<i>Listen to that crowd!</i>

01:46:06.052 --> 01:46:07.284
<i>Now cheering for Riggs.</i>

01:46:07.319 --> 01:46:08.820
<i>Not bad for an old man.</i>

01:46:08.854 --> 01:46:11.156
<i>Bobby still has
the break, Rosie.</i>

01:46:41.684 --> 01:46:43.784
<i>Marvelous point
won by Billie Jean!</i>

01:46:46.220 --> 01:46:47.855
<i>I'll tell you, she's tough.</i>

01:46:47.889 --> 01:46:49.457
<i>Walking back, she's walking</i>

01:46:49.489 --> 01:46:51.957
<i>more like a male
than a female.</i>

01:46:56.895 --> 01:46:59.063
<i>Out.</i>

01:46:56.895 --> 01:46:59.063
<i>Out.</i>

01:47:00.233 --> 01:47:01.567
<i>Double fault.</i>

01:47:05.904 --> 01:47:07.338
<i>You're looking</i>

01:47:07.372 --> 01:47:09.472
<i>at an apparently tired
Bobby Riggs.</i>

01:47:09.506 --> 01:47:11.007
<i>Look at how Billie Jean King</i>

01:47:11.042 --> 01:47:13.010
<i>has been running him
over the court.</i>

01:47:13.043 --> 01:47:15.411
<i>And that's been
her principal tactic,</i>

01:47:15.445 --> 01:47:17.412
<i>to wear him down.</i>

01:47:21.318 --> 01:47:22.884
<i>Yes!</i>

01:47:22.918 --> 01:47:24.485
<i>Beautiful!</i>

01:47:22.918 --> 01:47:24.485
<i>Great shot.</i>

01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:25.621
<i>And, wham,</i>

01:47:25.654 --> 01:47:27.255
<i>that's the kind of tennis
we've had...</i>

01:47:28.856 --> 01:47:29.890
<i>Right on, baby!</i>

01:47:29.925 --> 01:47:31.326
<i>She puts it away.</i>

01:47:32.261 --> 01:47:33.728
<i>Look at that!</i>

01:47:34.462 --> 01:47:36.030
<i>A brilliant move!</i>

01:47:36.064 --> 01:47:37.764
<i>Amazing shot.</i>

01:47:37.797 --> 01:47:40.332
<i>And she is at match point.</i>

01:47:46.338 --> 01:47:48.506
<i>I really hope
Jack Kramer is watching this</i>

01:47:48.541 --> 01:47:51.143
<i>and will cement something
in his head...</i>

01:47:51.176 --> 01:47:54.145
<i>...that women are not
some kind of joke.</i>

01:47:57.481 --> 01:48:01.618
<i>Bobby Riggs...
fights for his whole hustle.</i>

01:48:42.587 --> 01:48:44.655
I underestimated you.

01:49:52.648 --> 01:49:55.682
<i>It's the game
that's become a cause celebre.</i>

01:49:55.717 --> 01:49:59.086
<i>Equality for women.
Equal rights.</i>

01:49:59.119 --> 01:50:02.154
<i>It was Billie Jean who fought
for equal pay for women...</i>

01:50:02.189 --> 01:50:05.559
<i>...in the U.S. Open tennis
tournament and got it.</i>

01:50:05.591 --> 01:50:07.826
<i>Billie Jean King
played her own game,</i>

01:50:07.859 --> 01:50:10.028
<i>resting up,
being non-communicative...</i>

01:50:10.063 --> 01:50:11.963
<i>...but preparing
herself mentally</i>

01:50:11.998 --> 01:50:13.765
<i>and emotionally
and physically...</i>

01:50:13.798 --> 01:50:17.301
<i>...for a stunning performance
against Bobby Riggs.</i>

01:50:17.336 --> 01:50:20.038
Frank Gifford wants you live
right now. Come on.

01:50:20.070 --> 01:50:21.971
Frank Gifford wants to do
a live interview

01:50:22.006 --> 01:50:23.574
with you.
He's just over here.

01:50:23.608 --> 01:50:26.143
Just in a minute.
In a minute.

01:52:47.599 --> 01:52:49.500
Madame Superstar!

01:52:50.868 --> 01:52:53.070
Congratulations.

01:52:50.868 --> 01:52:53.070
Aww.

01:52:54.637 --> 01:52:55.872
Now, come on.

01:52:57.006 --> 01:52:59.908
The dancing can't start
without you.

01:52:59.942 --> 01:53:02.144
I'm not sure I'm ready
for all this.

01:53:04.079 --> 01:53:06.881
I think you may be more ready
than you know.

01:53:09.751 --> 01:53:12.019
Times change.

01:53:12.054 --> 01:53:14.154
You should know.
You just changed them.

01:53:19.894 --> 01:53:21.260
Someday...

01:53:21.295 --> 01:53:24.463
...we will be free
to be who we are...

01:53:24.497 --> 01:53:26.632
...and love who we love.

01:53:35.373 --> 01:53:36.440
But now...

01:53:37.442 --> 01:53:39.309
...time to join the dance.

01:53:50.252 --> 01:53:51.952
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

01:53:51.987 --> 01:53:54.489
<i>Billie Jean King!</i>

01:55:32.974 --> 01:55:35.809
<i>¶ If I dare to ask it ¶</i>

01:55:35.842 --> 01:55:38.679
<i>¶ Then I dare it to be true ¶</i>

01:55:38.712 --> 01:55:41.414
<i>¶ If I dare to risk it ¶</i>

01:55:41.448 --> 01:55:44.317
<i>¶ Then I know
that I'm willing to ¶</i>

01:55:44.350 --> 01:55:47.318
<i>¶ If I dare to want this ¶</i>

01:55:47.353 --> 01:55:50.087
<i>¶ To want more than I have ¶</i>

01:55:50.122 --> 01:55:52.691
<i>¶ Then I dare to believe ¶</i>

01:55:54.292 --> 01:55:58.129
<i>¶ I'll have it in the end ¶</i>

01:56:06.970 --> 01:56:09.805
<i>¶ You climbed the mountain ¶</i>

01:56:09.838 --> 01:56:12.506
<i>¶ Sent pictures of the view ¶</i>

01:56:12.542 --> 01:56:15.777
<i>¶ And still
can't believe when ¶</i>

01:56:15.811 --> 01:56:18.279
<i>¶ I started climbing, too ¶</i>

01:56:18.313 --> 01:56:21.082
<i>¶ You haven't heard that ¶</i>

01:56:21.115 --> 01:56:23.951
<i>¶ I'm not afraid to fall ¶</i>

01:56:23.984 --> 01:56:26.286
<i>¶ And I'm not deterred yet ¶</i>

01:56:27.121 --> 01:56:29.956
<i>¶ Until I tell them all ¶</i>

01:56:29.989 --> 01:56:32.826
<i>¶ I am ¶</i>

01:56:32.859 --> 01:56:37.030
<i>¶ Holding out ¶</i>

01:56:38.063 --> 01:56:42.199
<i>¶ For more than
what I have now ¶</i>

01:56:43.635 --> 01:56:50.342
<i>¶ I'm holding out ¶</i>

01:56:52.042 --> 01:56:54.577
<i>¶ I don't want your pity ¶</i>

01:56:54.612 --> 01:56:57.846
<i>¶ I won't use
your little scraps ¶</i>

01:56:57.881 --> 01:57:00.917
<i>¶ I don't build my cities ¶</i>

01:57:00.949 --> 01:57:03.717
<i>¶ With what could
get taken back ¶</i>

01:57:03.752 --> 01:57:06.453
<i>¶ I don't need permission ¶</i>

01:57:06.488 --> 01:57:09.089
<i>¶ To rise up when it hurts ¶</i>

01:57:09.123 --> 01:57:11.992
<i>¶ You don't have to listen ¶</i>

01:57:12.025 --> 01:57:15.128
<i>¶ But you'll hear me
Mark my words ¶</i>

01:57:15.162 --> 01:57:17.997
<i>¶ I am ¶</i>

01:57:18.030 --> 01:57:23.235
<i>¶ Holding out ¶</i>

01:57:23.269 --> 01:57:28.140
<i>¶ For more than
what I have now ¶</i>

01:57:29.274 --> 01:57:35.512
<i>¶ I'm holding out ¶</i>

01:57:37.582 --> 01:57:42.953
<i>¶ When the room gets dark
and I am quiet ¶</i>

01:57:42.987 --> 01:57:48.391
<i>¶ There's a voice that's soft
like someone's silhouette ¶</i>

01:57:48.425 --> 01:57:55.230
<i>¶ Saying don't let me go yet ¶</i>

01:58:06.072 --> 01:58:08.940
<i>¶ I am ¶</i>

01:58:08.975 --> 01:58:15.148
<i>¶ Holding out ¶</i>

01:58:17.550 --> 01:58:19.685
<i>¶ I am ¶</i>

01:58:20.217 --> 01:58:25.922
<i>¶ Holding out ¶</i>

01:58:25.957 --> 01:58:30.161
<i>¶ For more than
what I have now ¶</i>

01:58:31.161 --> 01:58:37.466
<i>¶ I'm holding out ¶</i>

01:58:39.836 --> 01:58:42.371
<i>¶ If I dare to ask it ¶</i>

01:58:42.404 --> 01:58:45.139
<i>¶ I dare it to be true ¶</i>

01:58:45.172 --> 01:58:48.074
<i>¶ If I dare to risk it ¶</i>

01:58:48.109 --> 01:58:50.945
<i>¶ I know
that I'm willing to ¶</i>

01:58:50.978 --> 01:58:53.945
<i>¶ If I dare to want this ¶</i>

01:58:53.980 --> 01:58:56.515
<i>¶ To want more than I have ¶</i>

01:58:56.548 --> 01:58:59.918
<i>¶ Then I dare to believe ¶</i>

01:59:00.886 --> 01:59:03.922
<i>¶ I'll have it in the end ¶</i>
