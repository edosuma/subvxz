WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:02.903
LINCOLN: I didn't kill that man,
Michael.

00:02.936 --> 00:05.406
MICHAEL:
The evidence says you did.

00:05.439 --> 00:07.141
I was set up.
Swear to me.

00:07.175 --> 00:08.342
I swear to you, Michael.

00:10.378 --> 00:11.812
(over bullhorn):
Put down your weapon!

00:11.845 --> 00:13.247
JUDGE:
I find it incumbent that

00:13.281 --> 00:16.317
you see the inside
of a prison cell, Mr. Scofield.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.386
I'm looking for someone--
guy named Lincoln Burrows.

00:18.419 --> 00:21.555
Why you want to see Burrows
so bad anyhow?
'Cause he's my brother.

00:21.589 --> 00:24.258
I'm getting you out of here.
That's impossible.

00:24.292 --> 00:26.227
MICHAEL: Not if you designed
the place, it isn't.

00:26.260 --> 00:28.096
(C-Note laughs)

00:28.129 --> 00:29.230
You one mixed-up cracker,

00:29.263 --> 00:30.198
you know that?

00:30.231 --> 00:31.532
Are we in business?

00:31.565 --> 00:34.168
Now... it's all about timing.

00:34.202 --> 00:36.504
T-BAG: Scofield. You
just as pretty as advertised.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.272
When do we get started?

00:38.306 --> 00:40.508
I need your help.
You're asking me
to break the law.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.042
I'm asking you
to make a mistake.

00:42.076 --> 00:43.744
Forget to lock up.

00:45.146 --> 00:46.314
(alarm wailing)
Come on.

00:49.283 --> 00:51.352
LINCOLN:
We did it, Mike.

00:51.385 --> 00:54.755
MICHAEL:
However this plays out...

00:54.788 --> 00:56.424
I have no regrets.

00:56.457 --> 00:57.291
LINCOLN (echoing):
Michael!

00:59.260 --> 01:01.762
Well, if you're watching this,
that means you're safe.

01:01.795 --> 01:04.063
I wish I could be there
with you,

01:04.098 --> 01:07.268
but as you know now,
I wouldn't have had much time.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.902
I made my choice.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.371
I don't regret it.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.373
We're free now.

01:12.406 --> 01:15.075
We're free.

01:19.012 --> 01:21.449
Freedom has a price.

01:25.753 --> 01:29.290
I died seven years ago.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.925
Left behind a brother...

01:31.959 --> 01:34.595
a wife...

01:34.628 --> 01:36.029
a son.

01:38.266 --> 01:40.801
But the dead talk...

01:40.834 --> 01:43.103
if you listen.

01:44.305 --> 01:47.508
They're there with you...

01:47.541 --> 01:49.910
reaching out...

01:49.943 --> 01:53.013
trying to tell you something.

01:53.046 --> 01:55.649
Because not all deaths
are the same.

01:56.684 --> 01:59.086
Some are real.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.121
Some are a story.

02:02.390 --> 02:05.159
Question is...

02:05.193 --> 02:07.295
do you believe the story?

02:07.328 --> 02:10.264
Was the man who died

02:10.298 --> 02:13.367
who you thought he was?

02:13.401 --> 02:16.103
The dead talk...

02:16.136 --> 02:17.971
if you listen.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.350
Still tight as...

02:29.383 --> 02:31.385
scales on a snake.

02:31.419 --> 02:34.121
Must have friends in
high places, Bagwell.

02:34.154 --> 02:37.358
How a cesspool like you gets his
walking papers I'll never know.

02:38.859 --> 02:42.530
This cesspool
has been a model citizen.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.164
Model citizen.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.400
(closes zipper)

02:46.434 --> 02:50.003
$71.31.

02:50.037 --> 02:52.706
Laptop.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.542
Pack of gum, three pieces.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.310
How about you keep that?

02:56.344 --> 02:58.412
Whatever you bring in,
you bring out.

02:58.446 --> 03:01.782
And one last piece
of correspondence.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.853
Something really wrong with
the world when I'm receiving

03:05.886 --> 03:08.155
dozens of letters a week
for guys like you.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.559
Nothing compared to the e-mails.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.661
What is it with you killers
that put the satin

03:13.694 --> 03:15.195
on women's panties anyhow?

03:16.196 --> 03:17.898
(exhales)

03:17.931 --> 03:19.933
*

03:29.443 --> 03:31.111
Lackaday!

03:34.582 --> 03:36.817
(car engine roaring)

03:39.820 --> 03:40.788
(tires squeal)

03:47.227 --> 03:48.396
(car doors closing)

03:48.429 --> 03:49.430
(panting)

03:49.463 --> 03:51.732
(weapon cocking)

03:53.767 --> 03:55.202
Burrows!

03:55.235 --> 03:57.405
How about you step out
and pay us

03:57.438 --> 03:59.573
the hundred grand
you owe us?

04:00.974 --> 04:03.311
Take that as a no.

04:03.344 --> 04:06.814
Lincoln Burrows... says no.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.083
Big tough guy...

04:10.117 --> 04:12.252
who made it out of
the neighborhood.

04:12.286 --> 04:14.488
And look at you now--
back to your roots,

04:14.522 --> 04:16.757
the way
you've always been.

04:16.790 --> 04:20.327
A small-time crook
who can't pay his debts.

04:20.361 --> 04:22.262
We're gonna find you, you know,

04:22.296 --> 04:24.164
and we're gonna
open you up.

04:24.197 --> 04:25.699
(car door closes, engine starts)

04:32.806 --> 04:35.776
(dog barking in distance)

04:38.045 --> 04:40.948
T-BAG:
Lincolny-linc.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.817
All huffin' and puffin'.

04:43.851 --> 04:46.687
Don't you look at me
like I'm trash.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.189
My house is in order.
I'm clear with the government,

04:49.222 --> 04:51.124
the D.O.C. and my God.

04:51.158 --> 04:53.126
Doesn't appear to be
the same with you.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.962
Look at you,
all backslid.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.465
You're supposed to be going
up in the world as you age,

04:57.498 --> 04:59.266
or did you not
get the memo?

04:59.299 --> 05:02.202
You don't get off my deck,
I'm gonna crack your skull.

05:02.235 --> 05:03.704
I wouldn't do that.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.773
Seems fate has deigned

05:05.806 --> 05:08.342
to join us at the hip
once again,

05:08.376 --> 05:11.211
despite our mutual contempt.

05:15.215 --> 05:17.851
Have a look-see.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.697
(sighs)

05:29.730 --> 05:31.699
Where'd you get this?

05:31.732 --> 05:33.867
Received it on release
earlier this week.

05:33.901 --> 05:35.369
No return address.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.172
If you're playing me,
I'll kill you.

05:39.206 --> 05:41.208
Take a look
at that postmark on that.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.545
I may be
a sophisti-cat,

05:44.578 --> 05:46.313
but not
so sophisticated

05:46.346 --> 05:48.449
as to forge something like that.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.052
Besides...

05:52.085 --> 05:55.556
what angle could I possibly have
in coming here

05:55.589 --> 05:57.391
and telling you that
it looks like your brother

05:57.425 --> 06:00.093
might just be alive?

06:00.127 --> 06:03.397
*

06:08.268 --> 06:10.270
*

06:41.835 --> 06:43.203
It's impossible.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.104
That's what I thought.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.739
Why'd he send it to you?

06:45.773 --> 06:47.775
Again, what I thought.

06:47.808 --> 06:51.078
And then I gave the words
another look-see.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.946
Maybe that's the answer.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.384
"By your hand

06:57.417 --> 06:59.386
"you shall know the
glories of your Progeny

06:59.419 --> 07:01.822
"and our world will be

07:01.855 --> 07:04.758
made right forevermore."

07:04.792 --> 07:06.927
Hell if I know
what that means.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.329
But just like that
envelope's addressed to me,

07:09.362 --> 07:11.164
those words are addressed
to me. Got to be!

07:11.198 --> 07:12.500
Get out.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.234
I'm trying
to work with you here.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.369
Is there any possible way
your brother could've survived?

07:18.939 --> 07:20.774
My brother's dead.

07:20.808 --> 07:23.010
Th-Then who sent
this? And why?

07:24.444 --> 07:26.113
Get out.

07:29.382 --> 07:32.285
At least let me take
my rightful correspondence.

07:34.555 --> 07:35.823
(scoffs)

07:35.856 --> 07:37.858
Oh, I made a copy, Burrows.

07:37.891 --> 07:40.594
I knew you'd be the same
obstinate son of a beyotch

07:40.628 --> 07:42.663
you always been, but I'd
hoped you'd seen the light.

07:42.696 --> 07:45.365
But you are what you is
and you is what you are.

07:45.398 --> 07:46.867
(scoffs)

07:48.468 --> 07:50.103
Still, I'm telling you...

07:50.137 --> 07:52.973
fate has got us joined
at the hip somehow.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.112
(door closes)

07:59.146 --> 08:00.480
(takes deep breath)

08:00.514 --> 08:01.749
(exhales)

08:07.054 --> 08:09.489
*

08:14.227 --> 08:15.996
MAN:
Where you in from?

08:16.029 --> 08:17.330
LINCOLN:
Chicago.

08:17.364 --> 08:19.166
MAN:
Love Chicago.

08:19.199 --> 08:22.169
There you go.
Thanks, man.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.900
(engine roaring)

08:58.538 --> 09:00.641
(exhales)

09:09.549 --> 09:11.118
(laughs softly)
I didn't think

09:11.151 --> 09:13.053
I was ever gonna
see you again.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.455
You didn't come
to the wedding.

09:15.488 --> 09:17.791
I mean, I...
I figured I, I get it--

09:17.825 --> 09:20.628
he hates me for marrying someone
other than his brother, but...

09:21.995 --> 09:24.632
I haven't been
in a good place, Sara.

09:24.665 --> 09:27.134
My brain, it's, it's,
it's been a mess.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.436
That's why I didn't show up.

09:29.469 --> 09:32.973
And I didn't want my nephew
to see me like that.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.775
(sighs quietly)

09:34.808 --> 09:37.911
But now it's impossible
to stay away.

09:37.945 --> 09:40.814
SARA: Someone's got
a sick sense of humor.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.951
I know you want it to be true.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.753
Losing a brother--

09:45.786 --> 09:48.055
the massive hole
that leaves in your life.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.958
Like the same massive hole
losing a husband makes.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.459
(sighs)

09:52.492 --> 09:54.527
Maybe.
(door opens, closes)

09:57.130 --> 09:59.099
Lincoln Burrows?

09:59.132 --> 10:00.233
Jacob.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.434
I haven't seen
you in what,

10:01.468 --> 10:02.602
three, four years?

10:02.636 --> 10:03.603
Yeah.
MIKE: Uncle Lincoln!

10:03.637 --> 10:05.839
Hey-hey! Buddy!

10:05.873 --> 10:07.307
Oh...

10:07.340 --> 10:08.976
so good to see you.

10:09.009 --> 10:11.645
Did you bring me
any sunken treasures?

10:11.679 --> 10:14.281
"Sunken treasures"?

10:14.314 --> 10:16.516
Oh. The dive shop.

10:16.549 --> 10:18.318
Panama.
Yeah, I've been
telling him stories

10:18.351 --> 10:21.088
about being down there before
we came back to the States.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.589
You've become kind of like

10:22.622 --> 10:25.425
a mythological hero to him.
Let me get some beers.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.860
I want to know what
you been up to.
Sure, man. Yeah.

10:26.894 --> 10:29.096
Okay.
Come here.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.031
I want you to go wash up, okay?

10:31.064 --> 10:33.300
And then you can catch up
with your uncle.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.372
He hasn't just
mythologized you.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.174
He mythologizes
Michael, too.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.977
It's like someone thinking
he was born to a god,

10:44.011 --> 10:46.446
a god he's never met...

10:46.479 --> 10:48.849
and who isn't here.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.753
And who never will be again.

10:54.021 --> 10:56.356
I can be pragmatic.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.692
Michael was sick.

10:58.726 --> 11:01.128
He was terminally sick.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.563
And he died.

11:04.732 --> 11:06.934
(sighs)

11:10.603 --> 11:13.573
Sara...

11:13.606 --> 11:15.542
how do you explain that?

11:15.575 --> 11:17.945
(sighs)

11:19.747 --> 11:21.548
It's Photoshop, Linc,

11:21.581 --> 11:23.516
or something.

11:23.550 --> 11:26.253
You got to consider
the source.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.688
This came
from T-Bag.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.826
I know you want
it to be true.

11:32.860 --> 11:36.463
I want it to be true.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.369
(loud, indistinct music plays
in next room)

11:42.402 --> 11:45.438
How about a date tonight,
model citizen?

11:45.472 --> 11:47.674
(groans)

11:47.707 --> 11:49.509
(sighs)
A little well-earned love

11:49.542 --> 11:51.511
after a long time at sea.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.881
Jeh... boop.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.949
Miss Dorothy.

11:55.983 --> 11:58.385
E-mailing her undying love

11:58.418 --> 12:01.654
from Aurora, Illinois.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.291
I-eesh.

12:05.558 --> 12:06.894
(sighs)
How about this one?

12:06.927 --> 12:10.363
"Love Cannon Alonzo
in Champaign."

12:10.397 --> 12:13.266
Ooh. Hop on that
just on the name alone.

12:13.300 --> 12:16.269
(computer chimes)

12:16.303 --> 12:18.238
What the hell?

12:18.271 --> 12:20.740
Prosthetic research?

12:24.577 --> 12:27.815
(sighs)

12:27.848 --> 12:30.818
(crow caws, birds sing)

12:30.851 --> 12:33.821
Smart girl, your Sara.

12:33.854 --> 12:35.322
She's right.

12:35.355 --> 12:38.225
I'm just desperate
to see your face.

12:38.258 --> 12:42.562
My life's been a mess
ever since you left.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.132
Fallen back into my old ways.

12:45.165 --> 12:47.968
Something
you wouldn't tolerate.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.403
But I got good in me, Michael.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.672
I got good in me.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.908
(Lincoln sighs heavily)

12:54.942 --> 12:57.344
It'd just be nice if

12:57.377 --> 13:00.613
you were here to...
help me find it.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.686
So... yeah.

13:06.719 --> 13:08.188
(crow caws)

13:28.808 --> 13:31.178
"Ogygia."

13:31.211 --> 13:34.047
(keyboard keys clicking loudly)

13:40.353 --> 13:42.990
Telling me where you are.

13:45.258 --> 13:46.994
There's only one way
to find out.

13:54.167 --> 13:57.070
(groans)

14:13.921 --> 14:17.090
MAN:
Theodore Bagwell.

14:17.124 --> 14:20.593
And you're Dr. Whitcombe,

14:20.627 --> 14:23.430
the man who invited me
to this mystery meeting

14:23.463 --> 14:28.201
at 9:30 at night when the rest
of the building's closed.

14:28.235 --> 14:30.237
I know what you've done.

14:30.270 --> 14:33.173
That's why I don't want to be
seen associating with your sort.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.342
Just want to know
why I'm here, and...

14:35.375 --> 14:37.744
if this has anything
to do with that special envelope

14:37.777 --> 14:39.112
I received in the prison.

14:39.146 --> 14:41.381
I know nothing
about an envelope.

14:41.414 --> 14:44.017
I can only tell
you my work.

14:44.051 --> 14:46.686
Targeted muscle reinnervation.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.689
Using the brain
to manipulate prosthesis

14:49.722 --> 14:51.591
as it were a natural limb.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.526
But as with any
cutting-edge work,

14:53.560 --> 14:56.296
funding is not easy
to find, and yet,

14:56.329 --> 14:58.231
incredibly, I got the grant

14:58.265 --> 15:00.233
in the form of a
considerable anonymous grant

15:00.267 --> 15:01.868
on one condition--

15:01.901 --> 15:05.405
the first recipient
of my procedure...

15:05.438 --> 15:07.140
is you.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.045
I can equip you

15:12.079 --> 15:14.447
with a fully articulate
prosthetic,

15:14.481 --> 15:17.084
operationally indistinguishable
from a real hand.

15:17.117 --> 15:21.654
All of this because
of an anonymous donor?

15:21.688 --> 15:24.057
Someone seems to have plans
for both of us.

15:24.091 --> 15:27.060
I've reserved an
operational lab for Monday

15:27.094 --> 15:29.662
if you decide
you are interested.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.498
It's your hand, ultimately.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.577
By your hand,

15:44.611 --> 15:49.482
you shall know glories
of your progeny.

15:49.516 --> 15:52.019
What's that?

15:54.721 --> 15:57.124
Nothing, Doc.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.494
(panting)

16:01.528 --> 16:04.031
(shovel thudding hollowly)

16:04.064 --> 16:06.533
(shovel clanks on ground)

16:19.879 --> 16:21.714
(grunting)

16:21.748 --> 16:23.683
(creaking)

16:37.530 --> 16:40.833
(panting)

16:43.036 --> 16:46.339
Come on, Michael.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.341
You must have left me something.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.143
Come on!

16:50.177 --> 16:53.913
(panting)

16:53.946 --> 16:55.715
Come on.

16:55.748 --> 16:58.118
(panting)

16:59.952 --> 17:02.355
(sniffs, panting)

17:16.035 --> 17:19.239
(brakes squeak)

17:31.084 --> 17:32.552
(computer chirps)

17:32.585 --> 17:34.621
(clack, tires squeal)

17:35.788 --> 17:37.790
(computer chirps)

17:39.992 --> 17:41.060
What's going on?

17:42.995 --> 17:44.397
(groans)

17:48.067 --> 17:49.736
(groans)

17:51.471 --> 17:54.141
(groans, tires squealing,
horns honking)

17:54.174 --> 17:56.143
(groans)

17:58.145 --> 17:59.646
(grunts)

18:08.788 --> 18:10.757
(loud gasping)

18:10.790 --> 18:12.725
(water gurgling)

18:12.759 --> 18:15.695
(groans, pants)

18:17.464 --> 18:19.432
(vehicle approaching)

18:20.867 --> 18:23.836
(panting)

18:38.185 --> 18:40.487
Oh, my God,
what happened?

18:40.520 --> 18:43.256
I'm not sure.
I'm gonna call

18:43.290 --> 18:45.658
the police.
(man speaks indistinctly)

18:45.692 --> 18:47.093
(panting)

18:47.126 --> 18:48.295
(indistinct chatter,
car door opens, closes)

18:48.328 --> 18:51.564
(car engine starts)

18:56.035 --> 18:58.405
(phone ringing)

19:01.140 --> 19:02.809
Hello?

19:02.842 --> 19:05.212
I dug up Michael's grave.
He's not in it.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.846
He... What?

19:06.879 --> 19:08.381
Sara, someone just
tried to kill me.

19:08.415 --> 19:09.682
They've been watching.
They've been watching,

19:09.716 --> 19:11.050
probably for...
Who tried to kill you?

19:11.083 --> 19:12.985
It started at the airport. I...

19:13.019 --> 19:15.355
There was a... a red sedan.

19:15.388 --> 19:16.723
It started following me.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.691
Then they, they, they swapped

19:18.725 --> 19:20.126
down to a...

19:20.159 --> 19:21.961
What was it?
A pickup.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.730
(vehicle engine approaching)

19:25.398 --> 19:26.633
What color was the pickup?

19:26.666 --> 19:27.667
LINCOLN:
Black.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.636
Why?
(phone beeps off)

19:29.669 --> 19:30.870
(dial tone sounds)
Sara?

19:30.903 --> 19:32.138
Jacob?

19:32.171 --> 19:33.740
Yeah.
Behind one of

19:33.773 --> 19:35.007
the pictures on the brick wall,

19:35.041 --> 19:36.509
there's a hole, and there's

19:36.543 --> 19:38.378
a gun in it. I need
you to get it.
What?!

19:38.411 --> 19:41.013
Right now! Right now!
Someone's coming for us!

19:41.047 --> 19:44.183
A gun? What do you mean, a gun?

19:45.385 --> 19:47.587
Mike?
(touch tones sounding)

19:47.620 --> 19:49.021
WOMAN:
911. What is your emergency?

19:49.055 --> 19:50.590
I have an armed intruder
in the house.

19:50.623 --> 19:51.724
I need you to send people
right away.

19:51.758 --> 19:53.593
I don't have time.
Please, come.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.230
Mike?
JACOB:
Sara?

19:57.264 --> 19:59.566
What's going on, Sara?

20:00.767 --> 20:02.502
(panting)
Hey.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.904
Mom?
Come here.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.639
(door slams open)

20:10.743 --> 20:11.978
(panting)

20:13.212 --> 20:15.415
Sara? Sara!

20:19.118 --> 20:21.220
(panting)

20:23.490 --> 20:25.625
(Jacob groans)

20:25.658 --> 20:29.462
(Jacob groaning)

20:29.496 --> 20:32.131
(pained groaning)

20:32.164 --> 20:35.134
It's just me. There's no one
else in the house.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.437
JACOB:
What do you want?
Get in the tub.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.608
Who's here, Mom?
What do they want?

20:41.641 --> 20:44.277
(Jacob groaning)

20:44.311 --> 20:46.313
I don't know, baby.

20:48.014 --> 20:50.950
(door squeaks open)

20:50.983 --> 20:53.286
(metal creaking, Sara groans)

20:56.188 --> 20:57.590
Okay, listen to me,
if anyone comes

20:57.624 --> 20:59.792
through that door,
you don't move, okay?

20:59.826 --> 21:02.395
I will put this through them,
and you will not be harmed.

21:02.429 --> 21:05.465
You understand?
Good boy.

21:18.378 --> 21:20.380
(sirens wailing in distance)

21:24.183 --> 21:26.386
(groans)

21:35.662 --> 21:36.963
Jacob?

21:36.996 --> 21:38.164
(Jacob groans)

21:38.197 --> 21:39.499
MIKE:
Mom.

21:39.532 --> 21:40.933
Go get every towel
you can find.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.369
Right now, right now.

21:43.503 --> 21:44.937
Please, Jacob.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.339
Okay. I think it got an artery.
Stay with me.

21:46.373 --> 21:48.174
I want you to look at me,
all right?

21:48.207 --> 21:49.942
Don't close your eyes
and don't go to sleep,

21:49.976 --> 21:52.278
all right? I'm gonna need you
to stay with me.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.546
I need an ambulance!

21:57.149 --> 21:59.519
(indistinct chatter)

22:04.090 --> 22:06.526
How is he?
The shot almost completely

22:06.559 --> 22:08.795
severed his femoral artery so
they're trying to stabilize him.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.296
And him?

22:10.329 --> 22:11.564
SARA:
He's seven.

22:16.903 --> 22:19.005
How you doing, Mikey?

22:19.038 --> 22:20.473
Something's happening,
isn't it?

22:20.507 --> 22:21.908
First, you come

22:21.941 --> 22:25.011
and that person
came in our house.

22:25.044 --> 22:29.048
It has something to do with
my real father, doesn't it?

22:29.081 --> 22:30.583
Why do you say that?

22:30.617 --> 22:33.285
Because I can see it
in her face.

22:37.089 --> 22:39.759
I'm gonna need
to talk to your uncle.

22:39.792 --> 22:41.861
I'm gonna be right over there

22:41.894 --> 22:44.631
where you can see me. Okay?

22:49.402 --> 22:50.770
What's going on?

22:50.803 --> 22:52.505
We've awoken something.

22:52.539 --> 22:54.340
Something people are trying
to hide about Michael.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.875
Your brother's dead, Lincoln.

22:55.908 --> 22:58.044
Or is he dead?
Where is the body?

22:58.077 --> 23:00.680
Then why did he leave?

23:00.713 --> 23:04.216
If he's been out there
for all of these years,

23:04.250 --> 23:06.619
why did he abandon his own son?

23:06.653 --> 23:08.555
You know I'm right.

23:08.588 --> 23:10.757
It wouldn't be like this if
something wasn't happening.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.792
It wouldn't, but...
Let's fight back.

23:12.825 --> 23:14.293
I don't know who we're fighting.

23:14.326 --> 23:15.695
Let's go to Yemen and find out.

23:15.728 --> 23:18.731
To Yemen? I have a son, Lincoln.

23:18.765 --> 23:21.133
My husband's in the ER. Right?
Look, leaving them is exactly

23:21.167 --> 23:22.602
the wrong thing
for me to do right now.

23:22.635 --> 23:24.704
Ma'am. He's ready to see you.

23:24.737 --> 23:27.006
One second.

23:30.276 --> 23:31.878
I'll do it.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.980
I'll go to Yemen.

23:34.013 --> 23:36.248
You don't know a damn thing
about Yemen.

23:36.282 --> 23:38.284
I'll find someone who does.

23:39.686 --> 23:41.754
See ya, Mikey.

23:47.460 --> 23:49.428
(men praying in Arabic)

23:49.462 --> 23:52.499
(praying continues)

24:00.773 --> 24:02.809
LINCOLN:
I envy you.

24:02.842 --> 24:05.077
You changed your life around.

24:05.111 --> 24:08.848
C-NOTE: A man gets tired
of living a profligate life.

24:08.881 --> 24:12.418
So I took up jihad.
Real jihad,

24:12.451 --> 24:15.454
not that madness
that you see on the news.

24:15.488 --> 24:17.023
War within.

24:17.056 --> 24:21.861
The spiritual struggle
to clean up your act.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.863
Finding and serving God.

24:25.898 --> 24:28.968
That's good, man.

24:29.001 --> 24:31.103
The world needs it, Linc.

24:31.137 --> 24:34.340
I mean we're, uh,
we're small here,

24:34.373 --> 24:35.875
but we do what we can

24:35.908 --> 24:37.644
to help the peace efforts
in the Middle East.

24:37.677 --> 24:41.280
Working on anti-radicalization
campaigns here at home.

24:41.313 --> 24:44.216
Like I said, the struggle.

24:45.417 --> 24:47.019
That's why I'm here.

24:47.053 --> 24:49.188
If I needed
to get to Yemen,

24:49.221 --> 24:50.857
that something
you could help me with?

24:56.062 --> 24:57.664
C-NOTE:
I thought he was dead.

24:57.697 --> 25:01.000
So did everyone.

25:01.033 --> 25:02.802
But Ogygia?

25:02.835 --> 25:04.203
I mean,
that's for heavy hitters,

25:04.236 --> 25:05.504
political prisoners.

25:05.538 --> 25:07.974
In Yemen,
it doesn't come any worse.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.643
I mean, do you know what
it would take to stage a death?

25:10.677 --> 25:13.412
Not to mention
keeping a man who is not dead

25:13.445 --> 25:15.481
under the radar
for seven years.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.717
Some very powerful players.

25:17.750 --> 25:22.521
Sayed, what do you make
of this mosque right here?

25:27.526 --> 25:29.896
Aksa Mosque. It's one of
the main ones in Sana'a.

25:29.929 --> 25:31.530
It's very distinct.
Ah.

25:33.132 --> 25:35.034
SAYED: Sightlines seem
pretty consistent

25:35.067 --> 25:37.536
with what it would probably be
from the prison to the mosque.

25:37.570 --> 25:40.840
Now, you ask me,
that photo's legit.

25:40.873 --> 25:44.744
Then that's the building
my brother's in.

25:44.777 --> 25:47.714
Easiest way to find out is
to call the prison and ask.

25:47.747 --> 25:51.117
Mafi Michael Scofield.

25:51.150 --> 25:52.952
Shukran.

25:55.922 --> 25:58.190
There's no Michael Scofield.

25:58.224 --> 25:59.558
Punch up an image
from the Internet.

25:59.592 --> 26:01.127
Michael Scofield.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.461
Send it to the prison.

26:02.494 --> 26:04.230
Maybe he's under
a different name.

26:04.263 --> 26:05.632
C-NOTE:
Listen, Linc,

26:05.665 --> 26:07.533
I got to say
something, man.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.068
Man, you got to
slow your roll.

26:09.101 --> 26:10.436
Yemen is in a civil war.

26:10.469 --> 26:12.271
They're really close
to collapse.

26:12.304 --> 26:15.374
It's no place for a white man
with an American passport,

26:15.407 --> 26:18.210
no command of Arabic,
to just show up on a whim.

26:18.244 --> 26:21.480
And yet, apparently,
my brother did.

26:21.513 --> 26:23.215
Got a picture.
Your brother's intake photo

26:23.249 --> 26:25.652
from the Fox River Penitentiary.

26:28.087 --> 26:31.624
Here's his DMV photo

26:31.658 --> 26:34.093
and here's a photo
from his old workplace Web site.

26:34.126 --> 26:35.527
LINCOLN:
It's not him.

26:37.129 --> 26:39.165
None of them are.

26:41.300 --> 26:43.135
Someone's erasing him
from history.

26:47.539 --> 26:49.475
C-NOTE:
Lincoln, where are you going?

26:49.508 --> 26:52.311
Hotel, to grab my stuff, then
the airport.

26:52.344 --> 26:54.781
Hey, listen, you're
not going to Yemen.

26:54.814 --> 26:56.916
Stop me.
You won't make
it three days.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.185
We need to go through
the proper channels.

26:59.218 --> 27:00.586
"The proper channels"?

27:00.619 --> 27:02.922
Someone's erasing
his existence.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.991
Who does that?
Who has that ability?

27:05.024 --> 27:06.358
I'm telling you,
Michael's caught

27:06.392 --> 27:07.760
in the middle
of something big.

27:07.794 --> 27:09.528
What if he's not caught
in the middle?

27:09.561 --> 27:11.463
What are you saying?

27:11.497 --> 27:13.432
Michael has never
been anyone's sucker.

27:13.465 --> 27:16.368
He's always been
in control. Always.

27:16.402 --> 27:18.037
You saying
he faked his own death?

27:18.070 --> 27:19.806
I'm saying you need to look

27:19.839 --> 27:21.207
at all of the possibilities,

27:21.240 --> 27:23.075
before you walk
into a war zone.

27:33.252 --> 27:35.521
(sighs)

27:35.554 --> 27:37.156
I wasn't sure you'd come.

27:37.189 --> 27:41.728
Sometimes a man has
to surrender to fate.

27:41.761 --> 27:45.197
See what it has in store
for him.

27:45.231 --> 27:46.866
(monitor beeping)

27:49.401 --> 27:51.137
WHITCOMBE:
We'll need to put you under.

27:51.170 --> 27:53.740
No, no, no. I don't do
general anesthetic, compadre.

27:53.773 --> 27:56.242
It's mandatory
for a procedure like this.

27:56.275 --> 27:57.643
You'll forgive me

27:57.676 --> 27:59.678
if I have a problem
lying unconscious

27:59.712 --> 28:02.314
before a man with sharp
items at his disposal.

28:02.348 --> 28:04.383
It cannot be done
without a general anesthetic.

28:04.416 --> 28:06.018
Oh, I've done it
before, friend.

28:06.052 --> 28:07.353
And look what it got you.

28:07.386 --> 28:09.388
(sighs)

28:09.421 --> 28:12.658
You do anything untoward to me
while I'm under and I'll...

28:12.691 --> 28:14.426
You are the last man
I'd run afoul of.

28:14.460 --> 28:16.929
Okay?
Mm.

28:16.963 --> 28:20.900
Oh, fate, you
mysterious bitch.

28:20.933 --> 28:23.602
Why you doing
this to me?

28:25.704 --> 28:29.341
(monitor beeping)

28:29.375 --> 28:32.278
Hi. Dry cleaning.
Nice jacket.

28:32.311 --> 28:33.679
Thank you, sir.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.081
Have a good day.

28:55.835 --> 28:57.269
(door creaks)

28:57.603 --> 28:59.705
(grunts)

28:59.738 --> 29:01.540
What the hell was that for?
Sucre!

29:01.573 --> 29:04.243
What the hell
are you doing here?

29:04.276 --> 29:07.146
C... C-Note told me
what's going on.

29:07.179 --> 29:08.915
He tell you
to talk me out of it?

29:08.948 --> 29:12.418
No. I'm coming with you.

29:12.451 --> 29:13.986
LINCOLN:
You're not coming.

29:14.020 --> 29:15.487
SUCRE: Michael's my best friend.
If he's alive,

29:15.521 --> 29:16.889
if he's in trouble,
I want to help.

29:16.923 --> 29:18.257
Don't you have a
job or something?

29:18.290 --> 29:20.492
Yeah, on a tramp.
Not great work,

29:20.526 --> 29:21.928
but hey,
I'm an ex-con, right?

29:21.961 --> 29:23.262
Tramp?

29:23.295 --> 29:24.630
Yeah, I've been riding her
for a while.

29:24.663 --> 29:25.932
What are you, a pimp?

29:25.965 --> 29:27.834
What? No.
No, no, no.

29:27.867 --> 29:29.902
A tramp is
a freelance cargo ship.

29:29.936 --> 29:31.503
We go to Hong Kong,
Spain, Buenos Aires,

29:31.537 --> 29:32.939
basically wherever
the boss tells us.

29:32.972 --> 29:34.440
Corrupt son of a bitch.

29:34.473 --> 29:36.308
Well, I suggest you
get back on that tramp,

29:36.342 --> 29:38.244
'cause you're not coming.
I'm telling you I can help!

29:38.277 --> 29:40.079
Listen to me, this
is the Middle East.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.248
Lots has changed.
I'm an international hitter now.

29:42.281 --> 29:43.649
A raconteur.

29:43.682 --> 29:45.617
I don't think that means
what you think it means.

29:45.651 --> 29:47.453
Don't speak to me like I don't
know French, I know French.

29:47.486 --> 29:48.654
And I'm brown, that's something.

29:48.687 --> 29:49.788
I'll fit in better
over there

29:49.822 --> 29:51.623
than you will, snowflake.

29:51.657 --> 29:53.259
I decided I was wrong
when I said

29:53.292 --> 29:55.161
you would be dead
inside of three days.

29:55.194 --> 29:58.797
You go over there,
you'll be dead inside of one.

29:58.831 --> 30:01.167
But with me,
we have people at the mosque

30:01.200 --> 30:02.601
that have worked
over there,

30:02.634 --> 30:04.003
people with
legal connections

30:04.036 --> 30:05.671
that can get us
inside of that prison.

30:05.704 --> 30:08.674
Hold on.
You're not saying he gets to go.

30:08.707 --> 30:10.209
He's not any browner than I am.

30:10.242 --> 30:12.511
(speaks Arabic)

30:12.544 --> 30:13.512
Huh?

30:13.545 --> 30:15.281
No?

30:15.314 --> 30:17.283
I managed to pick up
a little Arabic

30:17.316 --> 30:19.285
while I was serving in Iraq.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.353
WOMAN: This is the final
boarding call for Flight 39

30:21.387 --> 30:23.822
to JFK, connecting to Yemen.
This is the final boarding...

30:23.856 --> 30:25.524
Listen, man.

30:25.557 --> 30:27.193
There's gonna be a time
when I'm gonna need you.

30:30.362 --> 30:31.697
(plane taking off in distance)

30:32.731 --> 30:35.034
You better find him.

30:35.067 --> 30:36.869
And you better call me
when you do.

30:36.903 --> 30:38.670
I will.

30:43.609 --> 30:44.877
You really
got contacts?

30:44.911 --> 30:47.713
Contacts with contacts.

30:51.717 --> 30:53.986
Could just follow 'em
into the bathroom,

30:54.020 --> 30:56.588
ragdoll him in one of stalls
and be done with it.
(camera snaps)

30:56.622 --> 30:59.058
Then we'd have a body
to deal with.

30:59.091 --> 31:00.826
And we want him utterly

31:00.859 --> 31:04.730
and irrevocably gone
from this world.

31:04.763 --> 31:08.434
Where no amount of digging
will bring him back.

31:08.467 --> 31:11.703
(yelling, glass breaking)

31:16.442 --> 31:18.244
(indistinct chatter)

31:21.113 --> 31:23.015
We're the only ones coming
into the place.

31:23.049 --> 31:24.750
C-NOTE: Yeah,
the country's falling apart.

31:24.783 --> 31:26.385
Everyone wants out.

31:26.418 --> 31:27.453
Who's that contact again?

31:27.486 --> 31:28.687
A woman named Sheba.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.189
Our handler.

31:30.222 --> 31:31.423
She helps us track Americans
that come in

31:31.457 --> 31:32.624
to fight the jihad fight.

31:32.658 --> 31:35.694
(explosions, panicked chatter)

31:35.727 --> 31:38.864
(distant car alarms blaring)

31:38.897 --> 31:41.300
Welcome to the civil war.

31:41.333 --> 31:42.601
(man whistles loudly)

31:42.634 --> 31:44.636
Mr. Franklin,

31:44.670 --> 31:46.372
Ms. Sheba sent me
to collect you.

31:46.405 --> 31:47.539
As-salaam alaikum.

31:47.573 --> 31:48.807
Wa alaikum as-salaam.

31:48.840 --> 31:51.443
Uh, this way, gentlemen.
Follow me.

32:03.922 --> 32:06.993
GUIDE:
Yemen very dangerous.

32:07.026 --> 32:09.895
You never know who's enemies,
who's friends.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.263
Everyone scratching

32:11.297 --> 32:13.499
each other's backs.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.634
ISIL is starting
to attack the city.

32:15.667 --> 32:18.804
They have been building up
out in the desert for months.

32:18.837 --> 32:20.272
If they take the city,

32:20.306 --> 32:22.108
they will kill all
the secularists,

32:22.141 --> 32:23.942
install Sharia law.

32:23.976 --> 32:25.444
Huh. You know.

32:25.477 --> 32:27.313
You don't seem worried.

32:27.346 --> 32:28.580
(chuckles)

32:28.614 --> 32:31.350
I scratch backs, too, my friend.

32:40.226 --> 32:42.461
C-NOTE: No, no, no, no.
This isn't right.

32:42.494 --> 32:44.096
Hey, wait a minute,

32:44.130 --> 32:45.497
this-this isn't the address.

32:45.531 --> 32:47.466
I get cigarettes.
No, no, you don't.

32:47.499 --> 32:49.301
You take us straight
to the address right now!

32:49.335 --> 32:50.369
I-I get cigarettes.

32:50.402 --> 32:52.938
C-NOTE:
Linc, this is a setup.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.340
Grab your bag, get out.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.990
*

33:20.866 --> 33:22.101
(C-Note speaking Arabic)

33:25.237 --> 33:26.905
(man speaks Arabic)

33:26.938 --> 33:28.840
(grunting)

33:28.874 --> 33:30.409
(man speaks Arabic)

33:32.278 --> 33:34.413
(grunting, yelling)

33:44.123 --> 33:45.224
(shouts in Arabic)

33:57.403 --> 34:00.072
Greetings from the U.S.
prison system, bitches.

34:05.111 --> 34:06.112
What is it?

34:07.313 --> 34:08.746
Someone set us up.

34:09.481 --> 34:11.183
Come quickly.

34:11.217 --> 34:13.085
(gunfire)
Or we'll all be dead!

34:13.119 --> 34:14.886
Go, go.
She's one of us.

34:14.920 --> 34:17.422
Come on, grab your bag.
Come on, let's go!

34:17.456 --> 34:19.024
How did you find us?

34:19.056 --> 34:20.025
SHEBA: A contact
at the airport saw you

34:20.058 --> 34:22.027
get into the wrong taxi.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.130
You're lucky I found you.

34:24.163 --> 34:27.032
This is very radicalized
neighborhood.

34:27.065 --> 34:31.170
Whoever set you up couldn't
have set you up in a worse way.

34:33.172 --> 34:35.541
(panting)

34:35.574 --> 34:37.743
Throw your phones
out the window.

34:37.775 --> 34:40.146
I don't want anyone
tracking us.

34:42.981 --> 34:43.915
Do it!

34:43.949 --> 34:46.752
(opens, closes door)

34:46.784 --> 34:49.255
Sheba, this is Lincoln.

34:49.288 --> 34:51.857
Lincoln... Sheba.

34:55.761 --> 34:57.963
(monitor beeping steadily)

35:13.179 --> 35:15.013
(footsteps approaching)

35:16.548 --> 35:19.151
You've been made whole,
Mr. Bagwell.

35:19.185 --> 35:21.820
You're free to go.

35:24.790 --> 35:28.260
Not till you tell me
what you've put in me.

35:28.294 --> 35:30.662
You feel an unease, do you?

35:30.696 --> 35:34.166
I'd venture that's what's always
been in you since birth.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.968
Your soul. I just put
the hardware into you.

35:37.002 --> 35:39.070
You're the thing
that runs it.

35:41.407 --> 35:42.941
Who's behind this?
Nobody!

35:42.974 --> 35:44.543
Nobody's behind this.

35:44.576 --> 35:45.777
(groans)

35:45.811 --> 35:47.613
What does that mean?

35:47.646 --> 35:49.948
I got a single word.
That's it.

35:49.981 --> 35:53.185
Just, my benefactors I.D.'d
themselves by a single word.

35:53.219 --> 35:54.720
Outis.

35:54.753 --> 35:56.888
(grunts)
I looked it up.

35:56.922 --> 35:59.925
It's Greek for "nobody."

36:04.863 --> 36:07.233
That's who your benefactor is,
Mr. Bagwell.

36:07.266 --> 36:08.334
(panting)

36:08.367 --> 36:10.202
Nobody.

36:13.071 --> 36:16.174
(Muslim call to prayer
over speakers)

36:22.614 --> 36:24.583
(siren wailing in distance)

36:27.886 --> 36:30.256
(car horns honk in distance)

36:42.634 --> 36:44.870
(footsteps approaching)

36:44.903 --> 36:46.672
Okay.
(clears throat)

36:46.705 --> 36:47.906
LINCOLN:
Who's this?

36:47.939 --> 36:51.377
Omar has connections
in Ogygia Prison.

36:51.410 --> 36:52.944
He says he can
arrange a visit.

36:52.978 --> 36:54.179
That mean Michael's in there?

36:54.212 --> 36:55.414
There's apparently
an American

36:55.447 --> 36:56.415
in there matching

36:56.448 --> 36:57.549
your brother's description.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.217
There's just one thing.

36:59.251 --> 37:03.422
Arranging such a visit
is hard. Very difficult.

37:03.455 --> 37:05.391
Comes at a price.
Money's not a problem.

37:05.424 --> 37:06.925
(clicks tongue)
Not money.

37:06.958 --> 37:08.427
Your passport.

37:08.460 --> 37:10.128
My passport?

37:10.161 --> 37:11.297
What, you...

37:11.330 --> 37:14.065
you want to hold it?
No. Straight trade.

37:14.099 --> 37:15.934
Visit for your passport.

37:15.967 --> 37:18.937
Uh, U.S. passport
is like gold here.

37:18.970 --> 37:21.640
A few changes, and it can be
a ticket to freedom.

37:21.673 --> 37:23.275
Don't do it, Linc.

37:23.309 --> 37:24.576
C-NOTE:
Mm-mm.

37:27.078 --> 37:30.215
I know it is not
ideal, but...

37:30.248 --> 37:32.984
ideals as of right now
are history in Yemen.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.788
You cannot get out
of the country

37:36.822 --> 37:38.424
without a passport.

37:38.457 --> 37:40.292
Don't do it.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.301
Inshallah,

37:49.335 --> 37:52.003
you will see your brother soon.

37:58.043 --> 38:02.648
I told myself I'd never
step foot in another prison.

38:02.681 --> 38:05.283
As long as we walk out of it.

38:11.457 --> 38:15.327
(man grunting)

38:15.361 --> 38:18.029
(shouting in Arabic)

38:18.063 --> 38:20.065
(man screams)

38:22.233 --> 38:24.202
(shouting, clamoring)

38:33.879 --> 38:35.347
(speaking in Arabic)

38:40.419 --> 38:42.388
(speaks in Arabic)

38:52.664 --> 38:53.665
There's no Michael Scofield.

38:53.699 --> 38:56.201
It was a scam
to get my passport.

38:56.234 --> 38:58.303
Omar is one
of my most trusted operators.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.071
Listen, lady.
Trust doesn't seem to mean

39:00.105 --> 39:01.306
a whole lot in this country.

39:01.339 --> 39:02.541
Give me a second, okay?

39:02.574 --> 39:04.410
I'll figure out a way
to work this thing out.

39:04.443 --> 39:06.044
An image.

39:06.077 --> 39:07.312
Right? The one that
they sent to you?

39:07.345 --> 39:08.680
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Do you have it?

39:12.350 --> 39:13.519
Look.

39:13.552 --> 39:14.553
There.
(clears throat)

39:16.121 --> 39:17.989
Kaniel Outis.

39:18.023 --> 39:20.892
Yes, Kaniel Outis.
Is he here?

39:20.926 --> 39:23.361
(speaking in Arabic)

39:28.800 --> 39:31.403
He says, yes, the man
in the picture is here

39:31.437 --> 39:33.672
and we can see him, but only
'cause we're dealing with Sheba.

39:33.705 --> 39:34.940
Why did you say that name?

39:34.973 --> 39:36.742
Because of my brother's jacket.

39:36.775 --> 39:39.044
Thought you were on
the right side of God on this.

39:39.077 --> 39:40.912
Sheba. No, hey,
hey. Sheba...

39:44.883 --> 39:46.785
Hey. Kaniel Outis

39:46.818 --> 39:48.286
is a big-time terrorist.

39:48.319 --> 39:49.788
They got him in here for murder.

39:49.821 --> 39:51.122
He's been working with ISIL

39:51.156 --> 39:52.524
trying to take down
the government.

39:52.558 --> 39:54.125
Come on, C.

39:54.159 --> 39:56.361
You know that's not Michael.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.664
Well, whoever he is...

39:59.931 --> 40:02.067
...we're about to meet him.

40:02.100 --> 40:03.401
(thunder crashes)

40:03.435 --> 40:05.437
MIKE:
What was my father like?

40:07.806 --> 40:09.575
My real father.

40:12.511 --> 40:14.112
(sighs)

40:14.145 --> 40:16.181
Michael Scofield...

40:18.083 --> 40:20.018
...was like a storm.

40:21.453 --> 40:22.754
Grab the camera.

40:22.788 --> 40:24.422
I want to prove he's alive.

40:27.493 --> 40:30.929
He was beautiful

40:30.962 --> 40:34.332
and frightening

40:34.365 --> 40:36.434
and mysterious.

40:37.836 --> 40:40.305
And he would show up
in your life

40:40.338 --> 40:42.407
out of the clear blue sky

40:42.440 --> 40:47.112
and then he would disappear
just as quickly.

40:47.145 --> 40:49.414
But storms, they can come back.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.049
Can't they?

40:52.951 --> 40:54.352
Mm-hmm.

40:58.023 --> 41:01.359
Question is, if they come back,

41:01.392 --> 41:04.663
is it the same storm,

41:04.696 --> 41:07.098
or has something changed?

41:07.132 --> 41:08.834
(thunder crashes)

41:11.903 --> 41:13.338
Michael.

41:21.412 --> 41:22.714
New tats.

41:22.748 --> 41:25.717
What do you mean, new?

41:25.751 --> 41:27.485
We're gonna get you out of here.

41:29.020 --> 41:32.323
My name isn't Michael.

41:32.357 --> 41:35.193
And I don't know who you are.

41:38.263 --> 41:39.998
Sorry.

41:41.399 --> 41:43.501
(speaking in Arabic)

41:45.737 --> 41:47.405
Michael.

41:53.679 --> 41:56.081
Michael.

42:04.055 --> 42:07.025
Michael, talk to me. Michael...

42:07.058 --> 42:08.694
Mike.

42:08.727 --> 42:10.528
Mike! What are you doing,
damn it?!

42:13.031 --> 42:14.666
(door closes)

42:14.700 --> 42:18.103
(sobbing)

42:57.075 --> 42:58.977
