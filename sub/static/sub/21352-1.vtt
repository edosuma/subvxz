01:17.243 --> 01:18.544
<i> Hello?</i>

03:36.182 --> 03:37.649
Mom.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.952
You got a stomach
for breakfast today?

03:41.621 --> 03:42.554
Mom.

03:43.790 --> 03:44.790
Oh, hi, sugar.

03:48.294 --> 03:49.494
Oh.

03:51.497 --> 03:53.165
And that one, too.

03:53.167 --> 03:54.700
This one is zero refills.

04:00.039 --> 04:01.840
-Thursday.
-All day.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.611
You're having breakfast.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.748
Beth, come by three today.

04:11.618 --> 04:13.819
-Hello?
-Yeah, heard you.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.220
I need you home
with grandma tonight.

04:15.222 --> 04:16.622
I got offered overtime
at the store.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.023
Hire a babysitter.

04:18.757 --> 04:19.491
Hey!

04:19.493 --> 04:21.059
--Beth!

04:50.624 --> 04:53.792
Oh, look what you got here.

04:58.464 --> 04:59.564
There you go, sir.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.107
Sir, you don't want
to start a tab?

09:04.478 --> 09:05.610
Can I help you?

09:05.612 --> 09:06.978
I need a room, please.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.649
How many nights?

09:10.651 --> 09:12.183
I'll just pay as I go.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.418
I'll need to see an ID.

09:24.964 --> 09:26.164
You're the yurley boy.

09:27.099 --> 09:29.234
-Andy.
-Andrew.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.335
Right, Andrew.

09:31.037 --> 09:32.103
How much is it?

09:32.672 --> 09:34.739
It's uh... 40 dollars.

09:39.111 --> 09:40.478
Just heard
about your brother.

09:41.647 --> 09:42.981
What's happening?

09:44.016 --> 09:45.784
You're here
about the trial, I guess.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.652
No, that's not true.

09:47.654 --> 09:50.255
Well, Edgar said
they might let him go.

09:50.823 --> 09:52.157
Can I get my key, please?

09:57.530 --> 09:59.097
Room 157.

11:45.137 --> 11:46.071
Laura?

11:46.872 --> 11:48.006
Are you okay?

11:51.110 --> 11:53.311
I'm... I'm sorry, I...

12:16.268 --> 12:17.402
Sorry about that.

12:40.826 --> 12:42.894
Ms. yurley.
How're you today?

12:42.896 --> 12:44.462
Where the fuck were you?

12:44.464 --> 12:45.630
I'm well, thank you.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.398
Was it you?

12:47.400 --> 12:50.201
You wanna have a seat?
Can I get you
a coffee or what?

12:50.203 --> 12:52.570
I don't want coffee.
What is he doing here?

12:52.572 --> 12:54.506
-Who?
-Andrew.

12:54.508 --> 12:56.908
I saw him, okay?
I saw him.

12:56.910 --> 13:00.145
He was at the supermarket
buying a six pack and
fucking grape--

13:00.147 --> 13:01.479
he's in the diner?
You sure?

13:01.481 --> 13:04.382
Marci, can you hold
my calls for now?

13:04.384 --> 13:05.650
Hey, you can't
smoke in here.

13:05.652 --> 13:07.185
Don't tell me.
I pay your salary.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.487
I'm a public defender.
You don't pay me at all.

13:12.091 --> 13:13.458
He's here for the da.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.626
Found the mail in the car.

13:14.628 --> 13:15.894
You know where
he's staying?

13:15.896 --> 13:17.295
I came straight
from the store.

13:18.564 --> 13:20.498
All right. I want you to...

13:21.233 --> 13:22.767
Write down

13:22.769 --> 13:24.335
anything you remember.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.137
Write anything at all.

13:34.947 --> 13:36.214
What're you gonna do?

13:37.750 --> 13:39.017
I'll bring him in
to talk.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.752
Why in hell
would we do that?

13:40.754 --> 13:42.387
Because
i need him.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.722
And whatever little quarrel
the two of you still have,

13:44.724 --> 13:45.723
you're gonna put
aside for--

13:45.725 --> 13:46.858
I have told you--

13:46.860 --> 13:48.159
-time and again--
-enough. All right?

13:48.161 --> 13:50.195
I'm bored to death
of this.

13:50.197 --> 13:52.397
-He did this, he did that.
-So, he's here and then what?

13:52.399 --> 13:53.898
Huh? Then what?

13:53.900 --> 13:57.001
Well, I'd like for you
to see him and try to talk
some sense into him.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.169
You have no right.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.371
Since I've got
a good shot at
shaking hands

14:00.373 --> 14:02.907
with Louie gohmert,
i guess I'll do it myself.

14:02.909 --> 14:04.142
Michael's been doing good.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.743
He's been doing
real good all by himself.

14:05.745 --> 14:07.278
-He has?
-Getting his degree.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.513
Helping out
at the hospital.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.182
-All good things.
-So, we don't need Andrew.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.717
It's called character,
Ms. yurley.

14:12.719 --> 14:15.386
Michael is serving life
for murdering a young boy.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.222
If there's any chance
of getting him out,

14:17.224 --> 14:18.823
we need to show
he's changed.

14:18.825 --> 14:20.091
I can speak
to his character.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.060
Me. I'm the one
going out there
every week,

14:22.062 --> 14:23.795
taking him news,
talking to him,

14:23.797 --> 14:25.463
watching him wasting
away in there. Me!

14:25.465 --> 14:27.532
-I do that.
-It's not enough.

14:30.069 --> 14:33.037
Andrew's testimony
put his brother away.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.973
Having him up there now,

14:34.975 --> 14:37.208
saying how Michael
is rehabilitated,

14:37.210 --> 14:38.743
that's big points for us.

14:38.745 --> 14:42.180
As their sister,
you have to understand
how important that is.

14:45.317 --> 14:46.584
I don't want him involved.

14:48.020 --> 14:50.922
Well, Laura, you're
not my client.

14:50.924 --> 14:54.158
Michael's my client
and it's my job
to see him out.

15:39.805 --> 15:41.139
Mm.

15:42.675 --> 15:43.741
Mmm.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.781
Oh, they don't make it
like they used to.

15:51.150 --> 15:53.184
Mm, they certainly don't.

15:55.154 --> 15:58.323
Different be on what
you can imagine.

16:00.359 --> 16:01.793
Do you know
what I mean?

16:03.629 --> 16:05.196
- Hi!

16:05.198 --> 16:07.398
You know what I mean?

16:07.400 --> 16:10.034
Maybe you ain't old enough
to remember how it was.

16:10.036 --> 16:11.469
I'm old enough.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.376
There's a lot of darkness
coming out from you.

16:19.878 --> 16:21.412
A lot of dark energy.

16:25.317 --> 16:26.617
Let me see
your hand, baby.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.653
Let the boy be.
Do not bother him.

16:28.655 --> 16:29.587
I'm doing nothing.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.055
People do not like it.

16:31.057 --> 16:33.825
Am I bothering you,
young man?

16:33.827 --> 16:34.993
You ain't bother me none.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.461
See? He likes it.

16:36.463 --> 16:39.030
And put off
that cigarette
if you ain't no smoking.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.198
You know I'm trying to quit.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.566
Do not
start with me, girl.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.101
Oh, you wish
i would start.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.703
Hey, it's--it's on me.

16:46.472 --> 16:48.806
You know, make it two
and a beer.

16:52.378 --> 16:53.745
What's the occasion?

16:55.014 --> 16:56.748
Something lost...

16:56.750 --> 16:58.182
Is found.

17:03.555 --> 17:04.722
Thank you.

17:10.128 --> 17:12.663
To the... prodigal son.

17:18.337 --> 17:21.105
I'll... I'll assume
my letters...

17:21.107 --> 17:22.573
Got lost in the mail.

17:23.709 --> 17:24.842
Never got my messages?

17:26.412 --> 17:27.512
No?

17:29.448 --> 17:30.448
Yes?

17:37.289 --> 17:39.524
Andrew, my name is
Richard Gonzalez.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.325
Yeah, I know
who you are.

17:41.327 --> 17:43.461
Good.
Then I'll skip the pleasantries.

17:45.597 --> 17:47.131
What do you want?

17:47.133 --> 17:49.367
I should be
asking you that,
don't you think?

17:53.539 --> 17:54.672
You don't.

18:00.012 --> 18:01.879
Did the da call you?

18:01.881 --> 18:03.014
Did you talk to him?

18:03.949 --> 18:06.017
I didn't talk
to nobody.

18:06.019 --> 18:08.352
Hey, I'm not messing around.
Did you talk to him?

18:08.654 --> 18:09.720
Mm-mmm.

18:12.057 --> 18:13.324
Okay.

18:23.335 --> 18:24.702
How's Laura?

18:25.771 --> 18:26.737
She's, uh...

18:27.272 --> 18:28.406
She's great.

18:29.241 --> 18:30.374
Great.

18:31.810 --> 18:32.777
Laura's great.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.247
Andrew, we gotta talk about--

18:36.249 --> 18:38.883
listen, dick.
Can I call you dick?

18:38.885 --> 18:40.384
-No.
-Listen, dick.

18:41.553 --> 18:45.356
I used to work
on this dairy farm.

18:46.258 --> 18:49.560
Shoveling shit
out of cattle pens.

18:49.562 --> 18:54.165
Just, mounds and mounds
of shit and piss, man.

18:54.167 --> 18:55.933
Sometimes up to your knees.

18:56.902 --> 18:59.003
Horrible, dirty, nasty.

18:59.738 --> 19:01.072
Awful job.

19:02.808 --> 19:03.941
And...

19:05.010 --> 19:06.611
All that shit...

19:07.679 --> 19:08.846
Is nothing

19:09.948 --> 19:11.949
compared to the
amount of shit

19:12.551 --> 19:14.685
that you just waded into.

19:14.687 --> 19:17.355
-Look. I didn't come here--
-thank you, man.

19:20.058 --> 19:22.693
-Look, Andrew, wait.
-Don't forget to pay
the man, dick.

19:22.695 --> 19:23.761
No.

19:25.264 --> 19:26.397
How much for it?

19:28.834 --> 19:30.968
People are
gonna think we're together.

19:30.970 --> 19:30.968
Stop, god damn!

19:30.970 --> 19:33.371
Not really in the
little dark dudes.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.106
Look, we only got
one shot at this.

19:35.108 --> 19:36.374
Then you're
out of ammo.

19:36.376 --> 19:37.708
Then why
are you here?

19:37.710 --> 19:40.411
They got
the best jukeboxes
this side of Mississippi.

19:40.413 --> 19:41.913
You're acting like a child!

19:41.915 --> 19:42.914
Am I?

19:44.416 --> 19:46.017
-Am I acting like a child?
-Yes.

19:47.219 --> 19:49.287
You're gonna tell me
what's what?

19:49.289 --> 19:52.256
Wow. You're the one
they're all afraid of.

19:52.258 --> 19:54.992
Oh, yeah. You're
a tough guy, man.

19:54.994 --> 19:57.895
Coming in here
in your church pants
and your golf shirt,

19:57.897 --> 19:59.664
looking all spic and span.

20:00.132 --> 20:01.732
Sipping all that whiskey

20:01.734 --> 20:03.334
'cause you think
it's gonna impress me
and make us friends.

20:03.336 --> 20:04.802
Man, we ain't
going to be friends.

20:04.804 --> 20:05.636
Definitely not.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.371
Don't smoke up
my ass with this--

20:07.373 --> 20:08.639
-think about--
-Laura is great shit.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.541
Laura is great, dude.
Come on.

20:11.777 --> 20:13.844
At least made me believe
you're either

20:14.813 --> 20:17.682
lying or you are as delusional
as they are.

20:19.785 --> 20:21.886
I know exactly
what you're doing.

20:22.788 --> 20:24.956
Telling me what you think
i want to hear,

20:24.958 --> 20:27.158
so I'll do whatever it is
you want me to do.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.693
Man, you think I'm stupid?

20:29.595 --> 20:31.128
You think I'm stupid,
don't you?

20:33.966 --> 20:36.200
I've been here before, man.

20:36.202 --> 20:37.668
Stood in this
exact same spot,

20:37.670 --> 20:40.404
and let men with more years
than you walk all over me now,

20:40.406 --> 20:42.573
but god damn
if I fucking do it again.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.408
Fine. I ain't doing it.

20:45.077 --> 20:45.076
Oh, you done?

20:45.078 --> 20:48.479
'Cause if you're done,
I'm gonna talk now
and you can listen.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.314
Okay, all right.

20:50.316 --> 20:52.183
This isn't about you. Okay?

20:52.185 --> 20:55.686
Or Laura, or your mother,
or any of that other shit.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.022
Who cares?

20:58.024 --> 20:59.223
You should care.

20:59.225 --> 21:00.324
He did this to himself.

21:00.326 --> 21:01.926
Just would you go see him?

21:01.928 --> 21:03.294
Why would I do that?

21:03.296 --> 21:04.428
People change.

21:04.997 --> 21:06.664
-You think so?
-No, look.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.734
In case you change your mind.

21:11.470 --> 21:13.437
Let's just get this over with.

22:03.755 --> 22:04.689
Hey.

22:05.824 --> 22:06.824
Got a light?

22:23.075 --> 22:24.008
Any luck?

22:25.043 --> 22:26.510
What?

22:26.512 --> 22:28.179
Clearly, you want something.

22:29.481 --> 22:30.815
Yeah, I do.

22:31.817 --> 22:34.285
What do you want?
Beer, liquor or what?

22:36.054 --> 22:37.054
Root beer.

22:39.491 --> 22:40.825
Well, all right.

23:02.114 --> 23:03.214
Whatever.

23:09.588 --> 23:10.888
I need two.

23:20.065 --> 23:21.766
Anything else?

23:21.768 --> 23:24.135
Want a double
chambered slurpee?
They got them here.

23:25.204 --> 23:26.237
Pretty rare.

23:27.139 --> 23:28.139
Sure?

23:29.241 --> 23:30.307
You're missing out.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.781
Packet of Marlboro
and lights too, please.

23:42.387 --> 23:44.155
-Thanks.
-You got it.

24:09.214 --> 24:11.749
Now, I can't
leave you here
like that.

24:12.751 --> 24:14.185
I'm fine, thanks.

24:14.352 --> 24:15.586
No,

24:15.588 --> 24:18.622
this isn't a safe place
for a girl to be alone.

24:19.558 --> 24:20.758
With beer...

24:21.626 --> 24:23.060
In a mini skirt.

24:38.477 --> 24:41.111
It's just past
Sharon copley road.

24:42.514 --> 24:43.814
You know the hatchery?

24:47.486 --> 24:48.786
You know where you're going?

24:50.222 --> 24:52.957
-Yup.
-Okay.

24:52.959 --> 24:55.359
It's just... you're
not from here.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.661
Really?

24:57.663 --> 24:59.096
I'd have seen you around.

24:59.831 --> 25:01.198
I guess you're right.

25:02.133 --> 25:03.834
Okay.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.503
You're definitely
not the city boy.

25:05.505 --> 25:06.737
I can figure that much.

25:07.839 --> 25:10.508
I usually drive
a lot faster than this.

25:10.510 --> 25:12.209
In case you're wondering.

25:12.211 --> 25:14.745
Nice try.

25:14.747 --> 25:16.747
-What?
-Changing the subject.

25:17.782 --> 25:19.783
You're talking to a pro.

25:19.785 --> 25:21.719
I do it with my mum
all the time.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.654
Where does mommy think
you are tonight?

25:23.656 --> 25:25.456
She doesn't think anything.

25:25.458 --> 25:28.192
Uh... if she saw you
walk out of the house
dressed like that

25:28.194 --> 25:30.494
you can be sure as shit
she's thinking something.

25:30.496 --> 25:32.496
Hmm, like what?

25:32.498 --> 25:34.398
Like, where's the rest
of her skirt?

25:34.400 --> 25:35.599
It's not that short.

25:35.601 --> 25:37.468
"Growing out of her clothes
so quickly.

25:37.470 --> 25:38.702
I don't know what's going on?"

25:40.039 --> 25:43.007
"Buy some one day,
next day she can't fit in it."

25:43.009 --> 25:45.242
Hey!

25:49.147 --> 25:51.248
You not walking home
tonight, are you?

25:52.651 --> 25:55.185
Hmm, that's sweet.

25:56.154 --> 25:57.354
Come on.

25:57.956 --> 25:59.523
I'll be fine, thank you.

25:59.525 --> 26:01.058
I wasn't offering
to give you a ride.

26:01.060 --> 26:01.992
Oh, good.

26:13.638 --> 26:14.638
Thank you then.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.273
Get the beer from here.

26:16.275 --> 26:17.875
Let me pull up a little bit.

26:17.877 --> 26:19.510
I got it. I'm fine.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.447
Thanks for the ride.

26:24.215 --> 26:25.349
No problem.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.152
Did you wanna come?

26:28.154 --> 26:29.320
That's sweet.

26:30.957 --> 26:31.989
Right.

26:37.696 --> 26:39.029
Listen, um...

26:41.433 --> 26:43.667
-Uh... b-b-Beth...
-Beth.

26:43.669 --> 26:45.336
--Beth...

26:46.404 --> 26:51.175
I'm staying at the town motel.

26:51.177 --> 26:54.278
And I'm not saying
you can't take care
of yourself or anything but...

26:55.113 --> 26:57.548
If you need a ride
home tonight or...

26:58.683 --> 27:00.150
I don't know.

27:00.152 --> 27:01.318
You know...

27:03.755 --> 27:04.989
Thanks, uh...

27:06.324 --> 27:08.659
Andrew.

27:08.661 --> 27:11.528
And I know
you don't mean,
you know...

27:14.199 --> 27:15.232
Bye.

27:48.700 --> 27:49.833
Stop...

27:49.835 --> 27:51.301
No, I can't...

27:57.575 --> 28:00.277
Jesus, fuck!
Oh, wait...

28:00.279 --> 28:02.379
Move up, up. Up!

28:02.914 --> 28:04.381
Fucking tease cunt!

28:07.952 --> 28:09.386
That fucking hurt.

28:09.388 --> 28:10.854
Just chill, will you?

28:12.691 --> 28:14.525
You're leaving?

28:14.527 --> 28:15.993
What the fuck did you expect?

28:18.196 --> 28:19.630
Damn.

28:19.632 --> 28:21.098
I thought I would have won.

28:22.834 --> 28:24.268
What do you mean?

28:24.270 --> 28:26.036
Don't act like you don't know.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.705
We had a pool going.

28:27.707 --> 28:29.473
Whoever gets there first.

28:29.475 --> 28:31.475
Everyone wants to know
what you're like.

28:32.343 --> 28:33.544
You're crazy, right?

28:34.813 --> 28:37.581
White and scrunchy...

28:37.583 --> 28:39.817
-Golden hair...
-I can't be...

28:39.819 --> 28:41.318
Runs in the family, huh?

28:42.020 --> 28:43.821
Get the fuck off me!

28:43.823 --> 28:45.389
Why you got to be
such a bitch!

28:45.890 --> 28:47.257
You asshole.

28:47.259 --> 28:49.259
Come on, Beth,
I'm just fucking with you.

28:49.261 --> 28:50.461
Jesus!

28:50.463 --> 28:52.529
Beth, what's up? Beth!

28:54.599 --> 28:56.467
Fucking crazy bitch!

28:56.469 --> 28:58.268
You're fucking fucked up!

28:58.270 --> 28:59.336
Fuck you!

29:52.690 --> 29:54.024
What a surprise!

29:59.063 --> 30:00.397
Can you open the door?

30:12.343 --> 30:13.410
What happened?

30:19.417 --> 30:20.484
What happened?

30:25.857 --> 30:28.091
Which one's Corey?

30:28.093 --> 30:29.593
Who's Corey?
Are you cor?

30:29.994 --> 30:31.495
You fucking Corey?

30:32.764 --> 30:33.997
Who the fuck are you?

30:37.068 --> 30:40.370
You fucking touch her again,
I'll fucking kill you,
you understand me?

30:40.372 --> 30:41.805
Fuck...

31:08.633 --> 31:09.766
What happened?

31:15.340 --> 31:16.406
What did you do?

31:36.694 --> 31:38.095
Where do you live?

31:40.732 --> 31:42.232
I can't go home.

31:43.968 --> 31:45.669
My mom thinks
I'm at Jodie's.

31:50.842 --> 31:52.109
Well, what then?

32:50.702 --> 32:51.668
Here.

33:05.717 --> 33:06.817
You hungry?

33:07.986 --> 33:09.219
I'm okay.

33:09.887 --> 33:11.688
Hmm. Vending machine works.

33:12.290 --> 33:13.523
Not much in there but...

33:14.359 --> 33:16.226
If you change your mind,
or whatever...

33:17.128 --> 33:18.462
Something.

33:22.066 --> 33:23.800
Your hand's still bleeding.

33:25.069 --> 33:26.470
Just a little bit.

34:20.757 --> 34:23.460
This is the warmest jacket
I've ever worn.

34:25.630 --> 34:26.663
Feel like a duck.

34:34.237 --> 34:35.705
And it smells nice.

34:38.042 --> 34:40.177
Like salt and Clay.

34:40.179 --> 34:42.512
Like you went
somewhere in the ocean.

34:45.248 --> 34:46.850
I work on boats.

34:47.418 --> 34:48.485
Really?

34:49.487 --> 34:50.554
Tell me.

34:55.827 --> 34:57.828
On the south
in the pacific.

35:00.465 --> 35:01.898
When you're out that far,

35:03.067 --> 35:05.836
the ocean kinda
makes its own weather.

35:08.806 --> 35:10.040
Sometimes even

35:11.109 --> 35:12.476
its washovers

35:14.779 --> 35:16.012
raining down,

35:18.749 --> 35:20.417
water on all sides.

35:22.687 --> 35:24.321
Sounds beautiful.

35:25.790 --> 35:26.890
It's scary.

35:28.459 --> 35:30.026
That could be beautiful.

35:54.852 --> 35:55.986
When did you leave home?

36:00.324 --> 36:02.792
Long time now.
It's been a while.

36:06.230 --> 36:07.597
So it's nice.

36:10.067 --> 36:11.067
No.

36:13.137 --> 36:14.538
Besides, you'd be missed.

36:15.039 --> 36:16.406
I bet not.

36:16.408 --> 36:17.607
Don't say that.

36:20.311 --> 36:21.678
You don't know.

36:22.813 --> 36:23.914
I know enough.

36:27.552 --> 36:29.019
You're not even there.

36:31.489 --> 36:33.890
I'm about as important
as that couch.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.060
Couches are very important.

36:38.296 --> 36:39.930
Everybody needs a couch.

36:44.202 --> 36:45.502
What about you?

36:46.637 --> 36:47.637
What?

36:50.541 --> 36:51.841
Do you think you're missed?

37:14.765 --> 37:17.100
I grew up right around
barbel street.

37:21.839 --> 37:22.906
Little house.

37:31.482 --> 37:32.882
Normal family.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.156
I had a brother.

37:46.998 --> 37:48.064
Have.

37:48.866 --> 37:49.933
I have a brother.

37:59.210 --> 38:00.577
And he did this thing...

38:23.301 --> 38:26.569
Do you remember
that little boy who got
murdered years back?

38:34.679 --> 38:37.147
I testified about
what my brother did.

38:39.884 --> 38:42.619
And they put him away
for a real long time.

38:45.823 --> 38:46.823
Life.

38:49.894 --> 38:51.027
And my family,

38:52.263 --> 38:53.530
my sister,

38:54.632 --> 38:56.132
she didn't take it real well.

38:58.269 --> 38:59.836
She didn't take it real well.

39:00.871 --> 39:02.772
She had a lot
to say about that.

39:05.976 --> 39:07.177
So I left.

39:11.349 --> 39:12.916
And I haven't been back since.

39:21.992 --> 39:23.226
So you tell me,

39:27.064 --> 39:28.131
am I missed?

39:39.009 --> 39:41.311
Guess he's got a chance
to get out early.

39:45.616 --> 39:46.983
He needs my help.

39:49.086 --> 39:50.320
Or his lawyer does.

39:51.856 --> 39:51.855
So...

39:51.857 --> 39:57.093
All I got to do is put my hand
on a Bible and say,
"yes, sir." Or "no, sir."

40:00.598 --> 40:02.232
And it'll be good, right?

41:04.595 --> 41:05.762
I'm sorry.

43:07.051 --> 43:08.117
Mom.

43:10.721 --> 43:11.988
Hi, there, sugar.

43:12.289 --> 43:13.289
Hi.

43:14.325 --> 43:15.358
Time for bed.

43:22.132 --> 43:23.199
Come on, mom.

43:24.702 --> 43:26.970
Just getting to closing
my eyes for a second,

43:26.972 --> 43:28.938
-and I'm out.
-Mm-hmm.

43:30.541 --> 43:31.874
I'm all right.

43:32.876 --> 43:34.310
-Oh, no...
-All right.

43:35.279 --> 43:36.312
Oh.

43:39.950 --> 43:41.050
Oh.

43:52.029 --> 43:53.262
Ah.

43:53.264 --> 43:54.530
All right?

43:54.532 --> 43:56.099
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

43:59.003 --> 43:59.969
God.

44:15.252 --> 44:16.486
Okay.

44:20.591 --> 44:21.891
Want me to help you get

44:21.893 --> 44:23.092
under the covers?

44:23.627 --> 44:24.894
No, I'm fine.

44:25.863 --> 44:28.264
You want to change into
bed clothes or anything?

44:28.266 --> 44:30.433
No...

44:31.035 --> 44:32.035
Huh?

44:33.871 --> 44:35.538
-Hey!
-Sorry.

44:35.540 --> 44:36.472
Oh.

44:38.008 --> 44:39.842
-Good night.
-Good night.

44:40.611 --> 44:41.944
What's wrong?

44:44.181 --> 44:45.248
Nothing.

44:48.952 --> 44:50.186
I'm just tired, mom.

44:53.757 --> 44:55.391
All right, good night, sugar.

47:27.444 --> 47:28.544
Excuse me.

47:28.546 --> 47:29.512
Uh...

47:30.280 --> 47:31.347
Hey!

47:33.150 --> 47:35.084
Where the hell
have you been?

47:35.086 --> 47:37.220
You stop right now, young lady,
I'm talking to you.

47:37.222 --> 47:38.654
I want to know
where you were.

47:38.656 --> 47:39.822
You tell me right now!

47:39.824 --> 47:40.990
I'm not telling you shit!

47:40.992 --> 47:42.425
-Shit!
-Fuck off!

47:42.427 --> 47:44.794
You put that cigarette out,
you are fifteen years old.

47:44.796 --> 47:46.462
You want to know
where I've been.

47:46.464 --> 47:47.597
Can you get me
some water?

47:47.599 --> 47:48.664
I was with a man.

47:48.666 --> 47:49.632
All night.

47:49.634 --> 47:50.499
In his motel room.

47:50.501 --> 47:52.101
-That's not funny.
-It's true.

47:52.103 --> 47:53.402
Laura, water!

47:53.404 --> 47:55.404
He's older, and he buys me
cigarettes and beer.

47:55.406 --> 47:56.138
Mom!

47:56.140 --> 47:58.174
We have lots and lots of sex.

47:58.176 --> 47:59.208
You're disgusting.

47:59.210 --> 48:01.510
Me? I'm disgusting?
Look at you.

48:01.512 --> 48:02.712
You're fucking pathetic.

48:02.714 --> 48:04.280
Don't you talk
to me that way!

48:04.282 --> 48:06.282
All alone,
and a liar...

48:06.284 --> 48:08.184
You're grounded,
you are going nowhere
for a month!

48:08.186 --> 48:09.585
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are!

48:09.587 --> 48:10.786
Or what?

48:10.788 --> 48:12.121
You're gonna kick me out?

48:12.123 --> 48:14.290
Disown me,
pretend I don't exist?

48:14.825 --> 48:16.058
It's easy, right?

48:16.727 --> 48:18.394
I know you've done it before.

48:20.864 --> 48:23.065
All right, do whatever
the fuck you want.

48:23.067 --> 48:24.400
I give up!

48:24.402 --> 48:25.801
-Good.
-Good!

49:16.287 --> 49:17.253
Yeah?

49:39.042 --> 49:41.110
I will see you at nine.

49:41.112 --> 49:43.746
Yes, sherri, I will
wear something sexy.

49:45.582 --> 49:46.649
Okay!

49:46.651 --> 49:47.616
Bye.

50:28.425 --> 50:29.425
Hello.

50:34.031 --> 50:35.331
Who is this?

50:41.371 --> 50:42.405
Andrew?

53:16.893 --> 53:18.127
Mornin'.

53:18.129 --> 53:19.094
Mornin'.

53:21.898 --> 53:23.465
You slept on the sofa.

53:24.301 --> 53:25.568
Long night.

53:29.639 --> 53:31.340
You shouldn't
get out of bed by yourself.

53:31.342 --> 53:32.841
You're gonna fall.

53:32.843 --> 53:34.910
I should just
lay in there all day?

53:34.912 --> 53:36.078
Why, you free to help me?

53:37.114 --> 53:38.547
Didn't know
if you were home.

53:43.153 --> 53:44.553
I'll get your water.

53:48.225 --> 53:49.959
You started
with the drinking again.

53:51.261 --> 53:53.395
I hear them jangling
in your purse.

53:54.998 --> 53:56.098
You're one to talk.

54:24.394 --> 54:25.961
Hi, miss yurley.

54:25.963 --> 54:27.329
Is this a bad time?

54:27.331 --> 54:28.497
Yeah.

54:28.499 --> 54:30.099
- I mean...
- -Who is it?

54:30.101 --> 54:31.467
It's the lawyer.

54:31.469 --> 54:33.035
I'm sorry,
i should have called.

54:38.642 --> 54:40.876
Mom, you remember
Mr. Gonzalez.

54:41.378 --> 54:42.745
Meet you out back.

54:46.583 --> 54:49.351
You sure
we shouldn't include
your mother in this?

54:49.353 --> 54:50.586
I don't want to upset her.

54:54.991 --> 54:56.258
What's this?

54:56.260 --> 54:57.693
I filed for another continuance.

54:57.695 --> 55:00.529
I wanted to buy some time
with Andrew but...

55:00.964 --> 55:02.164
It's a no.

55:02.166 --> 55:04.967
And the hearing's is day
after tomorrow, as scheduled.

55:04.969 --> 55:07.469
This is the plan
from the beginning,
so what is the matter?

55:07.471 --> 55:10.272
You know for sure
that having him there
would give us what we want.

55:10.274 --> 55:11.940
I know. For sure.

55:11.942 --> 55:15.077
We would be presenting
the best case possible
with him involved.

55:15.079 --> 55:16.245
Then fix it already.

55:16.247 --> 55:17.413
Do your job.

55:17.415 --> 55:19.148
It is your job.

55:19.150 --> 55:20.249
Right? Not mine.

55:20.251 --> 55:21.750
That's exactly what
I've been trying to do,

55:21.752 --> 55:23.419
but you are not cooperating
one bit...

55:23.421 --> 55:24.720
Yeah, cooperating!
Cooperating?

55:24.722 --> 55:27.456
Tell me how can i
cooperate with you?

55:27.458 --> 55:29.358
You want me
to go and beg?
Hands and knees?

55:29.360 --> 55:30.759
-I didn't say that.
-Sounds like it.

55:30.761 --> 55:31.694
Well...

55:32.595 --> 55:34.196
So what if I'm saying that?
So what?

55:35.132 --> 55:35.130
No, no, I'm curious here.

55:35.132 --> 55:38.834
You certainly have limits
to what you would do.

55:42.672 --> 55:43.739
I...

55:46.843 --> 55:48.944
Have you ever had
something in your life

55:48.946 --> 55:50.746
that you knew just to be
absolutely true,

55:50.748 --> 55:52.348
as a person on this earth,

55:52.350 --> 55:53.849
and then it's just...

55:54.317 --> 55:54.316
Not?

55:54.318 --> 55:58.087
I mean, like being told
the color you've known
as blue your whole life

55:58.089 --> 55:59.154
is actually orange.

55:59.156 --> 56:00.222
I'm talking like that.

56:03.793 --> 56:04.727
Well...

56:07.764 --> 56:10.399
Well, I can tell you,
the world sometimes
makes zero sense.

56:10.401 --> 56:12.968
It's not like we had anybody
trying to help us
figure it out...

56:12.970 --> 56:14.336
It was up to me.

56:14.338 --> 56:15.738
I drew up the map,

56:15.740 --> 56:17.906
said this way is north,
this way is south.

56:17.908 --> 56:19.608
Here's a mountain
and a river,

56:19.610 --> 56:20.909
that's a tree...

56:21.511 --> 56:22.878
Made sense out of mush.

56:25.248 --> 56:27.216
A mountain's a mountain.

56:27.218 --> 56:28.951
Even if you call it
as a tree.

57:36.152 --> 57:37.119
Jesus.

01:00:05.969 --> 01:00:08.036
Oh...

01:00:08.671 --> 01:00:10.205
Oh, my god...

01:00:18.715 --> 01:00:20.849
Yeah, yeah...

01:00:23.621 --> 01:00:24.553
Here you go.

01:00:25.254 --> 01:00:26.788
I grabbed two.

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:31.793
Oh, I just got dizzy, honey.

01:00:31.795 --> 01:00:34.162
And I reached out,
and there was nothing there.

01:00:34.164 --> 01:00:35.130
I know.

01:00:36.432 --> 01:00:37.499
Here.

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:43.438
You're gonna be sweet,
ain't you?

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:47.909
Wish I'd done better.

01:00:49.545 --> 01:00:51.079
Are you okay, grandma?

01:00:52.081 --> 01:00:53.148
You okay?

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:55.350
The symptoms...

01:00:56.619 --> 01:00:57.919
Of Alzheimer?

01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:07.462
Do you need your pills?

01:01:11.034 --> 01:01:12.067
No.

01:01:16.639 --> 01:01:18.073
It's all so much.

01:01:21.378 --> 01:01:22.577
I should call mom.

01:01:22.579 --> 01:01:24.579
No, honey, stay, please!

01:01:27.717 --> 01:01:28.917
Okay.

01:01:29.752 --> 01:01:31.653
It is just so easy to let

01:01:31.655 --> 01:01:34.089
things slip away,
you know, rather sad.

01:01:35.491 --> 01:01:37.092
Like there were nothing there.

01:01:38.661 --> 01:01:39.928
What do you mean?

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:45.233
I've been seeing Andrew.

01:01:47.103 --> 01:01:49.237
I've been seeing him
all around.

01:01:51.808 --> 01:01:53.341
And I close my eyes,

01:01:55.344 --> 01:01:57.112
and he won't let me be.

01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:00.849
He's just calling out my name,

01:02:00.851 --> 01:02:03.485
like a ghost out by there.

01:02:04.854 --> 01:02:06.254
A ghost...

01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:12.094
That's coming out everywhere...

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:15.997
Every part of me.

01:02:20.369 --> 01:02:21.403
It's like...

01:02:23.306 --> 01:02:24.439
Did I say it?

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:26.274
Did I dream it?

01:02:29.645 --> 01:02:30.979
He's been calling.

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:34.216
Calling out for me.

01:02:34.218 --> 01:02:36.084
Just something awful, baby.

01:02:37.653 --> 01:02:40.288
Just pulling at my heart.

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:02.677
Just turn left.

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:09.584
Where are we going?

01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:14.422
Beth, what's happened?
You got to tell me, all right?

01:03:14.991 --> 01:03:16.424
Whatever it is.

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.161
I just wanted to help.

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:22.230
She misses you.

01:03:22.232 --> 01:03:24.399
Who? What are you
talking about?

01:03:36.779 --> 01:03:38.180
Grandma.

01:03:39.615 --> 01:03:41.082
She misses you.

01:03:43.886 --> 01:03:45.453
Is this a fucking joke?

01:03:46.355 --> 01:03:48.256
You think
this is fucking funny?

01:03:49.192 --> 01:03:50.759
You don't understand, my mom--

01:03:50.761 --> 01:03:51.760
Beth!

01:03:57.466 --> 01:03:58.667
My mom, Laura...

01:04:05.408 --> 01:04:06.508
Get out of the car.

01:04:07.743 --> 01:04:09.544
-Just...
-Get out.

01:04:09.546 --> 01:04:10.946
-No.
-Get the fuck out.

01:04:10.948 --> 01:04:12.314
So you can run away again?

01:04:15.384 --> 01:04:17.152
Fuck! This is...

01:04:17.154 --> 01:04:19.020
This is fucking fucked up.

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:20.689
This is fucking fucked up.

01:04:20.691 --> 01:04:22.057
You can't leave again.

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:23.491
This is...

01:04:25.094 --> 01:04:27.095
You can't leave again.

01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:29.798
I don't want you to.

01:04:31.234 --> 01:04:33.201
You're missed, Andrew.

01:04:34.103 --> 01:04:36.738
I know, I saw.
She said so.

01:04:37.673 --> 01:04:39.174
She said so.

01:06:05.628 --> 01:06:06.695
You came!

01:06:11.901 --> 01:06:13.268
You wanted to see me.

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:15.203
Yes!

01:06:16.105 --> 01:06:17.906
Beth said you ain't been well.

01:06:19.342 --> 01:06:20.909
Oh...

01:06:20.911 --> 01:06:24.346
I just I get
headaches sometimes.

01:06:25.448 --> 01:06:27.382
The doctor has me on pills.

01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:33.288
Where have you been?

01:06:34.023 --> 01:06:35.390
Lot of places.

01:06:35.791 --> 01:06:36.825
Where?

01:06:38.127 --> 01:06:39.694
Boats, fishing...

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:42.697
Crabs and lobsters.

01:06:46.268 --> 01:06:47.535
You'd like it.

01:06:47.970 --> 01:06:49.237
It's nice.

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:51.673
I don't know.

01:06:51.675 --> 01:06:54.709
It's nice. It's like when
we used to visit uncle sal
at the lake.

01:06:56.712 --> 01:06:57.846
Mm-hmm.

01:07:00.816 --> 01:07:02.350
Well, won't you sit down?

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:19.934
Well, are you going up
to see your brother?

01:07:21.237 --> 01:07:22.437
I don't know.

01:07:23.572 --> 01:07:24.539
Maybe.

01:07:27.143 --> 01:07:29.110
Ain't nothing to be afraid of.

01:07:29.112 --> 01:07:30.378
How is he doing?

01:07:31.814 --> 01:07:35.216
-Same, the way
he's always been.
-Yeah

01:07:35.851 --> 01:07:36.818
I bet.

01:07:45.594 --> 01:07:48.663
Do you remember
when you were young,
and we had that...

01:07:50.132 --> 01:07:52.233
That rabbit Coop out back?

01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:53.835
Yeah, I remember.

01:07:53.837 --> 01:07:55.236
And he had that book.

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:57.338
A giant thing...

01:07:58.874 --> 01:08:01.443
And he got in
with the female,

01:08:01.445 --> 01:08:03.745
and put her
in a family way.

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.381
And you were...

01:08:06.383 --> 01:08:09.317
So excited when
the bunnies was born.

01:08:11.887 --> 01:08:12.954
And then,

01:08:14.256 --> 01:08:16.291
you came out one morning,

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:18.893
and they was all dead.

01:08:18.895 --> 01:08:21.962
That bugger got in there
in the night and killed them.

01:08:21.965 --> 01:08:23.231
He hated all of them.

01:08:23.233 --> 01:08:24.698
That's right.

01:08:24.701 --> 01:08:26.533
And you were so sad.

01:08:28.437 --> 01:08:30.971
You just cried
and cried and...

01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:34.442
You were so scared of it.

01:08:35.911 --> 01:08:37.345
"Mama, how could it?"

01:08:38.214 --> 01:08:39.680
"How could it do that?"

01:08:42.184 --> 01:08:43.551
And the next day,

01:08:43.553 --> 01:08:45.653
it was like
it had never happened.

01:08:47.356 --> 01:08:49.957
You all playing in the grass,
it was like...

01:08:51.193 --> 01:08:52.861
It had never done that thing.

01:08:58.300 --> 01:08:59.968
Thought about that
the other day.

01:09:09.745 --> 01:09:11.011
Want some coffee?

01:09:12.781 --> 01:09:13.948
I'm okay.

01:09:16.218 --> 01:09:17.551
Good.

01:09:24.792 --> 01:09:25.926
Hey, sweetie.

01:09:26.261 --> 01:09:27.428
Hey.

01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:47.649
Here.

01:10:04.166 --> 01:10:05.500
My son.

01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:29.657
What's this?

01:10:34.496 --> 01:10:35.597
- Wait.
- -Move.

01:10:35.599 --> 01:10:37.232
- Get out of my way.
- -Just wait.

01:10:37.234 --> 01:10:38.600
Get out of my way!

01:10:38.602 --> 01:10:40.368
-Laura.
-Mother, quiet!

01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:42.003
Beth, move! Now!

01:10:42.005 --> 01:10:42.003
-Did you do this?
-Mom.

01:10:42.005 --> 01:10:44.505
-Please just listen to me.
-You have no idea.

01:10:44.507 --> 01:10:46.674
-Nothing's changed I see.
-You shut up!

01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:49.177
Beth, get out.

01:10:49.179 --> 01:10:50.712
No, no, she should
be here for this.

01:10:50.714 --> 01:10:52.647
Oh, no, god damn.
You don't get to do this.

01:10:52.649 --> 01:10:54.449
-You don't get to decide.
-What are you afraid?

01:10:54.451 --> 01:10:55.683
She's gonna hear
a little truth?

01:10:55.685 --> 01:10:57.085
Oh, god!

01:10:57.087 --> 01:10:59.587
You've been here a week,
and you know so much, huh?

01:10:59.589 --> 01:11:01.322
Two days, and I know
more than you.

01:11:01.324 --> 01:11:02.523
You know shit!

01:11:02.525 --> 01:11:04.659
I know your daughter needs
a mother and needs a friend.

01:11:04.661 --> 01:11:04.659
Shut up.

01:11:04.661 --> 01:11:07.829
I know her mother
is a fucking mess,
look at her.

01:11:07.831 --> 01:11:08.963
-She's sick.
-Look at your daughter.

01:11:08.965 --> 01:11:10.198
Look at Beth.

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:11.566
-No, no...
-You have any idea

01:11:11.568 --> 01:11:13.268
how I met your little girl.

01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:14.869
Who she goes around with...

01:11:14.871 --> 01:11:16.404
Hey, I am a good mother.

01:11:16.406 --> 01:11:17.905
Coming to my
fucking hotel room...

01:11:17.907 --> 01:11:20.041
You don't get to come in
to my fucking house,

01:11:20.043 --> 01:11:21.643
-and tell me...
-Oh!

01:11:21.645 --> 01:11:23.444
-Your house!
-Yeah! God damn right it is.

01:11:23.446 --> 01:11:26.014
Only reason you have
anything to come back to
is because of me.

01:11:26.016 --> 01:11:27.415
Oh, I love what you've done
with the place.

01:11:27.417 --> 01:11:28.983
You want some truth?

01:11:28.985 --> 01:11:30.251
Huh? Is that what you want?

01:11:30.253 --> 01:11:31.252
-You want some truth?
-Please.

01:11:31.254 --> 01:11:32.587
You're a liar.

01:11:32.589 --> 01:11:33.655
You're fucking insane.

01:11:33.657 --> 01:11:34.789
You couldn't handle
what happened.

01:11:34.791 --> 01:11:36.758
You created
some twisted story

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:38.259
but where were you, Andrew?

01:11:38.261 --> 01:11:39.460
Shut up.

01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:40.962
-Where were you?
-You're out of your mind.

01:11:40.964 --> 01:11:41.929
He took it too!

01:11:41.931 --> 01:11:43.931
He took it all for you.
He was just a boy.

01:11:43.933 --> 01:11:46.434
You weren't there,
you didn't see what he did!

01:11:46.436 --> 01:11:49.437
You didn't smell
what he did out there!

01:11:49.439 --> 01:11:51.372
-It was a game.
-Was not a fucking game!

01:11:51.374 --> 01:11:52.774
-And you put it on him!
-It wasn't a game.

01:11:52.776 --> 01:11:54.676
-Don't touch me!
-Don't touch you?

01:11:54.678 --> 01:11:56.244
-Don't fucking touch me.
-He was just a boy!

01:11:56.246 --> 01:11:57.345
I was a fucking boy!

01:11:57.347 --> 01:11:58.813
He took it
because he was your brother!

01:11:58.815 --> 01:12:00.915
- Laura. Andrew!
-Stop touching me!

01:12:00.917 --> 01:12:03.651
And you just tucked your tail
between your scrawny little legs
and ran

01:12:03.653 --> 01:12:05.787
leaving him alone to rot.
So fuck you...

01:12:05.789 --> 01:12:07.588
-You shut up!
-You're such a coward!

01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:09.190
- Ah...
-Shut the fuck up!

01:12:12.494 --> 01:12:14.696
Can you shut
the fuck up, all right?

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:17.098
Listen, Laura.

01:12:47.463 --> 01:12:48.963
We're sorry, Andrew.

01:12:54.069 --> 01:12:55.069
We're sorry.

01:12:55.804 --> 01:12:57.105
We...

01:12:57.107 --> 01:12:58.840
Made a huge mistake.

01:13:03.345 --> 01:13:04.779
We were wrong.

01:13:06.815 --> 01:13:08.015
I miss you.

01:13:10.719 --> 01:13:12.086
We miss you so much.

01:13:14.423 --> 01:13:15.656
I love you.

01:13:19.161 --> 01:13:21.829
I loved you, Andrew.

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:31.205
Stop!

01:13:31.207 --> 01:13:32.206
Wait!

01:13:32.208 --> 01:13:33.775
--Andrew!

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:37.145
- Wait!

01:13:37.147 --> 01:13:38.212
Andrew!

01:15:24.286 --> 01:15:25.319
Hey!

01:15:25.321 --> 01:15:26.387
Hi.

01:15:27.289 --> 01:15:28.990
- Hi.
-Hi, darling.

01:15:29.424 --> 01:15:30.892
What do you see?

01:15:34.062 --> 01:15:36.030
Honey, I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:15:36.965 --> 01:15:39.166
You were into me?
You said darkness.

01:15:39.168 --> 01:15:41.836
- You all right?
-He's all right. It's okay.

01:15:41.838 --> 01:15:43.638
What are you
talking about, baby?

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:44.739
Whoa...

01:15:44.741 --> 01:15:46.073
It's okay.

01:15:47.844 --> 01:15:49.410
Just calm down. It's okay.
Hey, hey, hey...

01:15:49.412 --> 01:15:50.945
-I got him.
-Tell me!

01:15:50.947 --> 01:15:53.714
- No! Hey!
-Guys,
we don't need to all that.

01:15:53.716 --> 01:15:55.449
Tell me!

01:15:55.451 --> 01:15:56.984
You see darkness?

01:16:08.797 --> 01:16:11.098
Well, fuck you too, then.

01:16:12.501 --> 01:16:13.768
Yeah.

01:16:17.839 --> 01:16:19.206
Need a light?

01:16:37.993 --> 01:16:40.061
- Be good.
-I ain't gonna bite you.

01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:46.867
Thank you.

01:16:47.836 --> 01:16:49.537
You want a cigarette?

01:16:49.539 --> 01:16:50.771
You got one?

01:16:56.011 --> 01:16:56.944
Thank you.

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:06.520
What was all that?

01:17:09.591 --> 01:17:11.892
You said you saw
darkness in me.

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:13.828
I said that?

01:17:16.531 --> 01:17:19.333
A lot to drink.

01:17:22.871 --> 01:17:24.839
But do you
believe in it?

01:17:27.175 --> 01:17:29.210
What do you mean,
like evil?

01:17:31.246 --> 01:17:32.813
That devil shit?

01:17:38.353 --> 01:17:39.920
Let me see your hand.

01:17:42.624 --> 01:17:43.824
That one.

01:17:47.162 --> 01:17:48.262
Wait a second.

01:17:53.235 --> 01:17:54.935
Shoot, it's faint.

01:17:54.937 --> 01:17:56.871
You got a strong will, though.

01:18:01.176 --> 01:18:03.377
You got an island,
a big one.

01:18:04.813 --> 01:18:06.080
What does that mean?

01:18:06.082 --> 01:18:09.483
This one line splits up,
and makes a big space.

01:18:09.485 --> 01:18:10.484
Like an island.

01:18:11.987 --> 01:18:14.355
What, like I'm split in two?

01:18:14.357 --> 01:18:15.456
Or something.

01:18:18.994 --> 01:18:20.828
But that ain't my fault.

01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:22.296
It never is, baby.

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:25.633
What, you don't like it?

01:18:26.501 --> 01:18:28.836
It's just folds on the skin.

01:18:28.838 --> 01:18:30.638
You like what you got,
you keep them.

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:32.406
You don't, don't.

01:18:32.408 --> 01:18:34.475
Work and tide changes lines.

01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:37.611
That's what my mom always said.

01:18:40.816 --> 01:18:42.149
I don't know...

01:18:42.151 --> 01:18:44.051
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do with that.

01:18:45.687 --> 01:18:47.254
Well, sure you do.

01:18:50.225 --> 01:18:52.493
There's no such thing
as evil, son.

01:18:52.495 --> 01:18:54.161
You trust me.

01:18:55.664 --> 01:18:59.500
There's just people
doing good and bad
to each other.

01:19:01.336 --> 01:19:04.138
You can find a way
to do more good
than bad.

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:06.373
Well...

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:13.114
Huh?

01:19:17.619 --> 01:19:19.019
All right.

01:19:21.857 --> 01:19:23.257
You're going to be okay?

01:19:25.627 --> 01:19:27.194
I think, yeah.

01:19:29.698 --> 01:19:30.931
All right.

01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:36.704
I'll see you.

01:19:43.945 --> 01:19:45.613
You need a ride or something?

01:19:47.182 --> 01:19:48.616
It's all good, darling.

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:32.253
Take a seat, please.

01:23:01.509 --> 01:23:02.910
Looks like it's going to rain.

01:23:03.411 --> 01:23:04.345
You think?

01:23:06.214 --> 01:23:06.880
Nah, it's going to pass.

01:23:10.852 --> 01:23:12.820
I like going out
in the yard
after it rains.

01:23:14.723 --> 01:23:15.889
Take my shoes off,

01:23:17.325 --> 01:23:19.293
put my toes in the mud.

01:23:20.061 --> 01:23:21.395
I don't know, it might.

01:23:27.702 --> 01:23:28.769
You got tall.

01:23:30.472 --> 01:23:31.505
Beard too.

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:39.246
You've been by home?

01:23:39.814 --> 01:23:40.781
Yeah.

01:23:40.783 --> 01:23:41.949
Nothing much has changed.

01:23:42.784 --> 01:23:43.617
What was that?

01:23:43.619 --> 01:23:45.652
I said nothing much
has changed.

01:23:45.654 --> 01:23:46.587
Hmm.

01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:50.724
I wasn't sure
if you would come.

01:23:51.993 --> 01:23:53.260
Me neither.

01:23:53.828 --> 01:23:54.928
Glad you did.

01:24:00.602 --> 01:24:01.668
It's all right.

01:24:03.004 --> 01:24:04.204
Just go ahead and...

01:24:08.143 --> 01:24:09.576
Go ahead and take your time.

01:24:19.821 --> 01:24:20.654
I'll get going.

01:24:24.392 --> 01:24:26.260
The sun ain't the same,
it's brighter.

01:24:27.495 --> 01:24:29.263
Doc says I'm sick
or something.

01:24:30.999 --> 01:24:32.666
You ain't feel sorry for you?

01:24:32.668 --> 01:24:33.767
Is that what I said?

01:24:35.937 --> 01:24:37.271
Did I say that?

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:54.955
I think about you a lot.

01:24:57.392 --> 01:24:59.660
Wonder where you are,
what you are doing.

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:06.467
You think about me any?

01:25:13.641 --> 01:25:14.608
Mom?

01:25:18.046 --> 01:25:19.446
What do you want me to say?

01:25:19.448 --> 01:25:21.648
You know exactly
what I want you to say.

01:25:21.650 --> 01:25:22.716
Fuck you, man.

01:25:24.219 --> 01:25:25.452
Then what?

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:26.987
What is this?

01:25:28.823 --> 01:25:31.358
I haven't seen you
in 20 fucking years now.

01:25:31.993 --> 01:25:33.560
I've got 30 minutes,

01:25:34.195 --> 01:25:35.729
to try and prove that I'm...

01:25:37.198 --> 01:25:38.532
Worth a damn?

01:25:40.068 --> 01:25:41.468
Are you worth a damn?

01:25:42.203 --> 01:25:43.670
Fuck you.

01:25:43.672 --> 01:25:44.771
This is bullshit.

01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:46.840
Is that it?

01:25:46.842 --> 01:25:48.775
I'm not gonna sit here
and try and...

01:25:51.813 --> 01:25:53.947
I'm not gonna sit here
and try and convince you...

01:25:54.516 --> 01:25:55.883
That I'm a good man.

01:25:59.354 --> 01:26:00.821
But I ain't a bad one.

01:26:01.890 --> 01:26:04.858
And I'm done with paying
for the crimes of a child.

01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:06.026
That's your doing, man.

01:26:06.028 --> 01:26:07.694
A boy. A boy did that.

01:26:07.696 --> 01:26:08.795
You are that boy.

01:26:08.797 --> 01:26:10.063
I ain't him no more.

01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:14.401
If that's not the point of this,
then what is?

01:26:18.473 --> 01:26:20.107
Should I rot in here?

01:26:22.177 --> 01:26:23.210
Hmm?

01:26:23.212 --> 01:26:23.977
Why?

01:26:27.448 --> 01:26:28.916
What's that gonna do?

01:26:30.718 --> 01:26:32.419
There's nothing
that can bring him back.

01:26:35.757 --> 01:26:37.791
And I'm sorry
about that, all right?

01:26:41.863 --> 01:26:42.996
I'm sorry.

01:26:47.702 --> 01:26:51.672
Not that I see
anything is gonna happen
to make sense of things.

01:26:56.711 --> 01:26:58.912
There are all these pieces
in my mind.

01:27:01.482 --> 01:27:03.483
Been running around
this way and that,

01:27:03.485 --> 01:27:05.385
and over and over again.

01:27:05.387 --> 01:27:07.487
Thinking that
it's gonna be different.

01:27:10.525 --> 01:27:12.960
It doesn't change,
it's always the same.

01:27:19.734 --> 01:27:20.801
So...

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:23.070
I ask myself,

01:27:26.374 --> 01:27:28.775
how far back
did my sense go?

01:27:31.746 --> 01:27:34.147
At what point
does the bad come in?

01:27:35.883 --> 01:27:38.385
At what point in the story
could I have done
something different

01:27:38.387 --> 01:27:39.686
to make it go good?

01:27:44.626 --> 01:27:46.093
I would have done it anyway.

01:27:50.131 --> 01:27:51.598
If not that night...

01:27:53.334 --> 01:27:54.835
Some other one,

01:27:54.837 --> 01:27:55.969
some other way.

01:28:08.616 --> 01:28:11.184
Remember that summer
we took that trip
to lake Michigan?

01:28:14.389 --> 01:28:16.223
Laura warned us to stay
close to the shore

01:28:16.225 --> 01:28:18.892
but me and you wanted to see
how far we could swim out.

01:28:22.463 --> 01:28:23.864
We were way out.

01:28:26.167 --> 01:28:27.768
Out passed the buoys,

01:28:27.770 --> 01:28:29.836
waves and waves
up over our heads.

01:28:31.773 --> 01:28:34.975
It felt like
we swam for miles.

01:28:34.977 --> 01:28:38.512
You finally got scared,
and said, "that's it, enough."

01:28:45.486 --> 01:28:47.187
How do you know
that's your limit?

01:28:52.827 --> 01:28:53.860
How do you know?

01:28:57.865 --> 01:28:58.999
I don't know.

01:28:59.434 --> 01:29:00.701
But I do.

01:29:02.937 --> 01:29:04.738
Trust me, Andy, I know.

01:29:07.775 --> 01:29:09.943
And I know I never want
to go back there again.
