WEBVTT

00:02.144 --> 00:04.478
There's is no way
you're going to make that shot.

00:04.513 --> 00:06.258
Yeah.
Iron Man's right.

00:06.259 --> 00:08.026
That's just not going to happen.

00:11.598 --> 00:14.400
I don't like to use
the word impossible,

00:14.434 --> 00:16.835
but it may fit here.
What do you think, Hulk?

00:16.870 --> 00:21.440
Don't care. Only came in case
Hawkeye started a fight.

00:21.474 --> 00:23.876
Thanks for the support, team.

00:23.910 --> 00:26.378
What do you think, old man?

00:26.413 --> 00:27.980
I haven't seen you miss yet.

00:28.014 --> 00:29.815
I don't expect you to start now.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here

00:38.825 --> 00:40.759
What? Did I make the shot?

00:40.794 --> 00:41.960
Where's Tony?

00:41.995 --> 00:43.729
What happened?

00:50.103 --> 00:53.839
Uhh, that was an EMP,
an electromagnetic pulse.

00:53.873 --> 00:55.974
Why isn't the mansion
power up yet?

00:56.009 --> 00:57.976
Well, it could have
handled one pulse,

00:58.011 --> 01:00.646
but it looks like three went off
in the city back-to-back.

01:00.680 --> 01:02.714
We have to get out up there now.

01:06.519 --> 01:08.687
You know, there were stairs
we could have taken.

01:08.721 --> 01:10.055
Hey, you're the one

01:10.089 --> 01:12.090
who said there was, uh...

01:12.125 --> 01:14.726
...trouble.

01:14.761 --> 01:15.928
Avengers,

01:15.962 --> 01:19.465
I need your help.

01:19.665 --> 01:29.865
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrected by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:16.103 --> 02:17.156
Natasha.

02:19.668 --> 02:20.968
Hulk remembers you.

02:21.003 --> 02:24.038
Stupid spy girl attacked Hulk
in the desert.

02:24.072 --> 02:26.073
Yeah, and she's a traitor.

02:26.108 --> 02:27.708
A member of Hydra.
Go smash her.

02:31.947 --> 02:33.081
Have to listen.

02:33.082 --> 02:34.415
Widow, you got about
three seconds

02:34.449 --> 02:35.382
before we let the Hulk squeeze.

02:36.229 --> 02:38.310
Did you set off the EMPs?

02:38.574 --> 02:40.189
Not a traitor.

02:40.190 --> 02:42.892
You have to believe.

02:42.926 --> 02:45.194
Nick Fury sent me
to get inside Hydra.

02:45.228 --> 02:48.230
Clint, please.

02:50.233 --> 02:51.801
Let her breathe, Hulk.

02:51.835 --> 02:55.805
She saved my life,
I owe her that.

02:55.839 --> 02:57.206
You've gone soft.

02:57.240 --> 02:58.307
Ohh.

02:58.375 --> 03:01.243
This better be good, Natasha.

03:01.278 --> 03:03.212
You got one minute.

03:03.246 --> 03:04.547
Start at the beginning.

03:07.207 --> 03:08.674
The AIM base has been located.

03:08.709 --> 03:10.876
Its coordinates
are being transmitted

03:10.911 --> 03:12.645
to every Hydra ship.

03:12.679 --> 03:15.915
Modoc is to be destroyed.

03:15.949 --> 03:20.119
No one touches the cube
except me.

03:20.153 --> 03:22.588
Baron, I need to know
what we're dealing with here.

03:22.623 --> 03:25.758
I am the only lieutenant
you have left,

03:25.792 --> 03:30.263
and I cannot help you
if I don't know what is going on.

03:30.297 --> 03:33.266
Modoc and AIM
have created a device

03:33.300 --> 03:38.137
that can change reality itself.

03:38.171 --> 03:41.140
The cosmic cube was designed
to take one's deepest desires,

03:41.174 --> 03:44.410
their greatest wishes,
and make them reality.

03:44.444 --> 03:48.881
For instance,
a reality where Hydra

03:48.915 --> 03:50.716
won the Second World War.

03:50.751 --> 03:53.286
But if Modoc had such a device--

03:53.353 --> 03:55.454
He would have used it by now.

03:55.489 --> 03:57.790
That is exactly why
we must capture it

03:57.824 --> 04:00.159
before it is complete.

04:00.193 --> 04:03.796
And then the world will be mine.

04:03.830 --> 04:05.431
Hail, Hydra!

04:05.465 --> 04:08.067
Hail, Hydra! Hail, Hydra!

04:08.101 --> 04:09.902
Hail, Hydra!

04:21.558 --> 04:22.692
This was my mission--

04:22.726 --> 04:24.727
To infiltrate Hydra,

04:24.761 --> 04:27.463
learn the nature of the weapon
they had hired AIM to create,

04:27.497 --> 04:28.931
and neutralize it.

04:32.736 --> 04:33.769
No one could have foreseen this.

04:33.804 --> 04:35.482
I don't buy it, lady.

04:35.483 --> 04:38.218
If you infiltrated Hydra
under orders from Nick Fury,

04:38.253 --> 04:41.155
then why come to us?
Why not go to him?

04:41.189 --> 04:43.991
I tried. He had set up
a special channel for me

04:44.025 --> 04:47.895
to contact him when I needed to,
but he's not responding.

04:47.929 --> 04:51.231
As far as Shield knows,
the Black Widow is a traitor.

04:51.266 --> 04:53.734
If I go to them,
I'll be arrested.

04:53.768 --> 04:56.003
Fury was the only one
who knew the truth,

04:56.037 --> 04:59.012
and as far as I can tell,
he's disappeared.

04:59.013 --> 05:01.581
Yeah, I'm with Cap,
I don't buy it.

05:01.616 --> 05:03.216
Not the Fury part,
that I can believe.

05:03.251 --> 05:04.751
But a cosmic cube?

05:04.786 --> 05:07.387
Come on, nothing can
just change reality.

05:07.422 --> 05:08.989
It doesn't matter
what you believe.

05:09.023 --> 05:10.869
Both Strucker and Modoc
believe it.

05:10.870 --> 05:12.703
And they're going
to tear the city apart

05:12.737 --> 05:13.804
fighting for control of it.

05:19.665 --> 05:22.300
Kind of like that, I'm assuming.

05:25.438 --> 05:28.273
If you so much as sneeze
in a way I don't like,

05:28.307 --> 05:30.041
I'll let the Hulk
have you for lunch.

05:30.076 --> 05:31.309
Got it, Widow?

05:31.344 --> 05:32.677
Of course.

05:32.712 --> 05:35.413
We all want
the same thing here, Iron Man.

05:35.448 --> 05:39.117
Once we get the cube,
I'll surrender myself to you.

05:39.151 --> 05:42.120
Isn't funny how people
are all afraid of you?

05:42.154 --> 05:43.888
I bet she really thought
you'd eat her.

05:43.923 --> 05:45.824
I would.

05:47.026 --> 05:48.994
Heads up, team.

05:57.453 --> 06:00.255
Shields are holding.
The EMPs took down

06:00.289 --> 06:01.723
some of the Hydra forces,

06:01.757 --> 06:03.424
but the majority are equipped
with shielding that--

06:03.459 --> 06:06.427
That we designed for them.
It does not matter.

06:06.462 --> 06:10.028
We do not need to defeat Hydra,
we only need to delay them.

06:10.268 --> 06:12.770
<i>17 minutes until influx</i>

06:12.804 --> 06:15.472
<i>of extra dimensional energy</i>
<i>is complete.</i>

06:17.176 --> 06:20.311
Iron Man, what's the ETA
on Thor and Panther?

06:20.345 --> 06:22.572
<i>They're nine minutes out.</i>
<i>This is crazy.</i>

06:22.573 --> 06:24.773
<i>I think that AIM ship</i>
<i>just opened a black hole.</i>

06:24.808 --> 06:26.842
Huh, I say we let them fight.

06:26.876 --> 06:28.310
Enjoy the show.

06:28.344 --> 06:30.412
There's nothing to enjoy
about fighting.

06:30.446 --> 06:32.181
<i>You're doing it wrong then.</i>

06:32.215 --> 06:34.783
The tracer I planted
on Strucker's ship is active.

06:34.818 --> 06:36.385
We can find him and make sure

06:36.419 --> 06:37.920
he doesn't get close to the cube.

06:37.954 --> 06:39.721
Hang on,

06:39.756 --> 06:41.456
I'm picking something up.

06:41.491 --> 06:43.692
That's Modoc's energy signature.

06:43.726 --> 06:44.694
Jarvis, scan the ship.

06:47.025 --> 06:48.726
Wait, what?

06:51.760 --> 06:54.361
Wasp, make sure he's okay.

06:58.767 --> 07:00.334
Okay, what was that?

07:00.368 --> 07:02.803
My whole system just
shorted out when I tried--

07:02.837 --> 07:04.238
Ah!

07:19.635 --> 07:21.970
This is gonna be a long day.

07:30.201 --> 07:31.435
Agh, come on.

07:31.469 --> 07:33.704
Come on, you stupid armor,
reboot.

07:35.140 --> 07:36.974
Come on!

07:39.577 --> 07:42.388
Cap, we've got
giant atomic robo-monsters

07:42.389 --> 07:43.850
coming into the city by the pier.

07:46.093 --> 07:48.545
Ow.
Oh, and Iron Man's okay.

07:48.546 --> 07:50.380
<i>Hulk and I will take care of Hydra.</i>

07:50.414 --> 07:53.483
<i>You and Iron Man</i>
<i>keep after Modoc.</i>

08:01.759 --> 08:03.594
Um, I don't know
if you guys noticed,

08:03.628 --> 08:05.429
but Hydra's invading New York.

08:05.463 --> 08:07.364
We noticed, Wasp.

08:13.290 --> 08:14.272
Agent Hill.

08:14.273 --> 08:15.825
Director Hill.

08:15.826 --> 08:18.027
And I'm putting
this entire city on lockdown

08:18.061 --> 08:21.097
including the Avengers.

08:45.275 --> 08:46.408
Just like old times, right?

08:46.443 --> 08:48.410
Expect for all the lies
and betrayal.

08:48.445 --> 08:50.746
You think it wasn't
hard for me, Clint?

08:50.780 --> 08:54.950
Which part,
framing me or beating me up?

08:54.985 --> 08:57.419
I had my orders. You would
have done the same thing.

08:57.454 --> 09:00.389
I don't believe that.

09:00.423 --> 09:02.658
Hawkeye was your partner,
and your friend.

09:02.692 --> 09:04.660
Couldn't you have just
tried trusting him?

09:04.694 --> 09:06.562
No.

09:06.596 --> 09:07.675
I just don't understand that.

09:07.676 --> 09:10.644
I do. I don't like it,
but I get it.

09:10.678 --> 09:12.312
Undercover is undercover.

09:12.346 --> 09:13.680
She couldn't have gained
Strucker's trust

09:13.715 --> 09:15.148
without doing what she did.

09:15.183 --> 09:18.518
I must had been one big pain
in your backside.

09:18.553 --> 09:19.953
You have no idea.

09:19.987 --> 09:21.888
And thought Jan and I
had problems.

09:26.563 --> 09:30.199
That one. That's the ship
the tracer signal is on.

09:39.109 --> 09:41.244
Baron Strucker wanted you

09:41.278 --> 09:45.081
to have this, traitor.

09:47.685 --> 09:49.085
Uh-oh.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.164
Sir, incoming!

10:04.270 --> 10:05.804
Save Modoc.

10:42.328 --> 10:43.862
Lucky shot.

10:43.896 --> 10:46.364
If you say so, big guy.

10:46.399 --> 10:48.834
Now, remember,
watch out for civilians.

10:48.868 --> 10:51.036
Is that why you
teamed up with me?

10:51.070 --> 10:53.405
To protect people
from the monster?

10:53.439 --> 10:54.840
Stow that talk.

10:54.874 --> 10:57.576
I want you to protect civilians
from Hydra.

10:57.610 --> 10:59.192
They're the monsters here,
not you.

10:59.193 --> 11:01.727
In my day, we had a name
for someone like you.

11:01.761 --> 11:03.528
Yeah, what's that?

11:03.563 --> 11:05.864
Hero.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.733
I've been watching you, Hulk.

11:07.767 --> 11:10.102
No matter how scared people
are of you,

11:10.136 --> 11:11.904
no matter how much
you're hounded,

11:11.938 --> 11:13.805
you always do the right thing.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.375
And that makes you
a hero in my book.

11:16.409 --> 11:19.511
Now, how about we smash
some more Hydra goons?

11:27.369 --> 11:30.805
<i>Cosmic cube at 99.9 %.</i>

11:30.839 --> 11:34.976
<i>Attention, the cosmic cube</i>
<i>has attained full power.</i>

11:53.961 --> 11:55.629
Okay, look.

11:55.663 --> 11:57.551
I know you and I got off
to a rocky start, Hill,

11:57.552 --> 11:59.252
but we need to work
together here.

11:59.286 --> 12:01.854
The Black Widow says
that AIM has created a weapon

12:01.889 --> 12:03.589
of incredible power,
and we have to--

12:03.624 --> 12:05.124
We don't have to do anything.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.560
The Black Widow is a traitor
working for Hydra.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.128
You expect me to believe her?

12:09.162 --> 12:11.791
The bottom line?
You Avengers are vigilantes,

12:11.792 --> 12:14.194
and unless you join Shield
right here and now,

12:14.228 --> 12:16.062
you're criminals as well.

12:16.097 --> 12:17.330
I've had about enough of you.

12:17.365 --> 12:19.332
I'm going after the cosmic cube,

12:19.367 --> 12:21.668
which is dangerous,
as it turns out.

12:21.702 --> 12:23.003
You're welcome to help.

12:23.037 --> 12:26.339
Come on, Jan.

12:26.374 --> 12:28.842
Take them down.

12:33.948 --> 12:37.785
Damage assessment, negligible.
Searching.

12:37.819 --> 12:39.153
Ah.

12:40.322 --> 12:42.356
The game is over,

12:42.391 --> 12:44.292
you disgusting monster.

12:44.326 --> 12:46.260
The cube is mine.

12:46.295 --> 12:49.030
Had you just given it to me,

12:49.064 --> 12:52.233
I would have allowed you
a place in my new world.

12:52.267 --> 12:54.474
Instead, you get a grave.

12:54.475 --> 12:57.310
I am Modoc.
I can not be defeated!

13:03.751 --> 13:07.286
I am designed only for conquest!

13:11.358 --> 13:15.128
Dreadnoughts, destroy Modoc.

13:25.407 --> 13:28.375
Not possible.

13:28.410 --> 13:30.377
No brainwaves.

13:31.802 --> 13:38.375
Now, the world will be remade
in Hydra's image.

14:21.444 --> 14:23.678
You're sure you can
make this shot?

14:23.713 --> 14:24.780
He'll make it.

14:38.074 --> 14:40.109
Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker,

14:40.110 --> 14:41.877
you really don't
want to touch that.

14:41.912 --> 14:43.112
It could be dangerous.

14:43.146 --> 14:45.514
Dreadnoughts,

14:45.549 --> 14:47.283
execute this fool!

14:50.921 --> 14:52.254
Oh, boy.

14:55.526 --> 14:56.726
Jarvis, shields.

15:10.074 --> 15:11.908
What is the matter with you?

15:11.943 --> 15:13.109
We're on the same team.

15:13.144 --> 15:14.878
You have to stop this.

15:14.912 --> 15:16.913
No, you got
one last chance, Wasp.

15:31.393 --> 15:32.467
Maybe the Avengers

15:32.468 --> 15:35.103
are going to give you
one last chance, Maria.

15:36.671 --> 15:38.105
No.

15:40.042 --> 15:42.676
Thor, Panther, Wasp, just stop.

15:42.711 --> 15:44.093
We're not going to fight Shield.

15:45.246 --> 15:47.714
My team is going out there
to save the world.

15:47.748 --> 15:50.116
Either work with us
or stay out of our way.

15:51.919 --> 15:55.255
This is director Hill
to the helicarrier.

15:55.289 --> 15:57.524
Fire on the Avengers.

16:04.431 --> 16:06.966
Avengers, save the helicarrier.

16:07.001 --> 16:09.435
Move!

16:20.514 --> 16:21.781
Ah!

16:48.770 --> 16:51.381
Your strength
is now mine, Captain.

16:51.674 --> 16:54.242
At last, I will finish this.

17:07.130 --> 17:09.164
Everyone relax,
I'm here to save the world.

17:09.198 --> 17:10.632
Again.

17:10.665 --> 17:11.733
I-- Whoa.

17:15.471 --> 17:17.672
Cap! Hawkeye!

17:20.210 --> 17:22.243
See? Fighting is fun.

17:34.260 --> 17:36.728
I've been fighting you
since you were a kid, Strucker.

17:36.762 --> 17:39.831
Today it ends.

18:07.671 --> 18:12.408
Strucker, by the order
of Shield you are under arrest.

18:12.442 --> 18:14.043
Yeah, take that.

18:14.779 --> 18:16.913
Never!

18:16.947 --> 18:18.548
No!

18:37.535 --> 18:39.941
I-- I don't understand.

18:40.215 --> 18:41.949
Nothing has changed.

18:41.983 --> 18:45.385
But-- but I touched it,
the cube.

18:45.420 --> 18:48.388
It's over, Strucker.

19:09.712 --> 19:12.205
So the Avengers took down
Hydra and AIM,

19:12.206 --> 19:14.708
saved your helicarrier,
and probably the world.

19:14.742 --> 19:16.576
Even after you shot at me.

19:16.611 --> 19:18.712
Nothing's changed, Stark.

19:18.746 --> 19:20.414
I'm not giving
the Avengers a pass.

19:20.448 --> 19:21.782
I'm not Nick Fury.

19:21.816 --> 19:23.606
I'm going to the president
and congress.

19:23.607 --> 19:26.541
I want the Avengers registered,
and working for Shield.

19:26.576 --> 19:28.777
And I'm going to make it happen,
whether you like it or not.

19:31.814 --> 19:32.981
You're clear.

19:36.752 --> 19:38.820
This is crazy, Natasha.

19:38.854 --> 19:40.855
Come back to the mansion with me.

19:40.890 --> 19:43.658
The Avengers will protect you
until we can locate Fury.

19:43.693 --> 19:46.324
No, I have to find him.

19:46.645 --> 19:48.841
Clint, if Fury really is missing,

19:48.842 --> 19:52.478
then something terrible
has happened. Come with me.

19:52.512 --> 19:55.114
I can't.

19:55.148 --> 19:56.315
I'm an Avenger.

19:56.349 --> 19:58.784
They're my partners now.

20:08.418 --> 20:10.519
I can't believe all of that was for nothing.

20:10.554 --> 20:13.022
The cube thingamajig
didn't even work.

20:13.056 --> 20:14.357
I knew it wouldn't work.

20:14.391 --> 20:15.858
Just imagine though.

20:15.892 --> 20:17.043
What if they had done it?

20:17.044 --> 20:19.944
You can change anything
just by touching the cube.

20:19.979 --> 20:21.623
You touched it, Cap.

20:21.714 --> 20:24.916
If it had worked, how would you
have changed things?

20:24.950 --> 20:26.518
What would you have wished for?

20:26.552 --> 20:29.587
The world did change today.

20:29.622 --> 20:32.057
Today the Avengers
took down Hydra.

20:32.091 --> 20:35.260
Something I was never
able to do in my time.

20:35.294 --> 20:37.495
And we didn't need
wishes to do it.

20:37.530 --> 20:41.399
I wouldn't change anything.

20:41.434 --> 20:45.937
No, no, Bucky!
