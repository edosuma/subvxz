WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:03.537
ANNOUNCER: Thanks for
downloading this Fox show.

00:03.571 --> 00:05.706
And don't miss
all-new episodes on Fox.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.076
Previously on Empire...

00:08.109 --> 00:09.843
PHILIP:
You got shot.

00:09.877 --> 00:11.679
Your PTSD is no less
significant than mine.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.147
If you need treatment, man...

00:13.181 --> 00:14.515
LUCIOUS: No, the only person
that's killing you

00:14.548 --> 00:15.916
right now, Mal, is you.

00:15.949 --> 00:17.017
The one thing that
ain't changed

00:17.051 --> 00:19.153
in the music business,

00:19.187 --> 00:20.354
it's artists that
don't perform,

00:20.388 --> 00:21.522
they die.

00:21.555 --> 00:22.523
I got to meet Angelo's

00:22.556 --> 00:23.657
stuck-up mama.

00:23.691 --> 00:24.658
I think she just want to

00:24.692 --> 00:26.060
check out my black ass.

00:26.094 --> 00:27.895
Andre, I need you!

00:27.928 --> 00:29.563
Now, I never ask
you for nothin'.

00:29.597 --> 00:30.731
I can't stay, Nessa.
I promised my mom

00:30.764 --> 00:32.366
I'd be there for her tonight.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.402
Andre, this is
a special night for me.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.003
This means a lot to me.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.072
Are you coming in here to
thank me for helping your ass

00:38.106 --> 00:39.673
with Shine? Because you know
you still owe me

00:39.707 --> 00:40.708
for that, right?

00:40.741 --> 00:42.076
DIANA:
I see why Angelo is attracted

00:42.110 --> 00:44.345
to you.
You got fire in you.

00:44.378 --> 00:47.548
You just make sure that fire
doesn't burn my child.

00:49.150 --> 00:52.153
*

00:54.122 --> 00:56.424
* We throwin' caution
to the sky *

00:58.926 --> 01:02.730
* Poppin' rainbows
like all the time *

01:03.964 --> 01:06.200
* We on another level

01:06.234 --> 01:07.568
* High

01:08.769 --> 01:11.139
* The DJ is my alibi

01:13.641 --> 01:15.309
* Let's play a game,
watch you fold *

01:15.343 --> 01:18.246
* Like a house of cards

01:18.279 --> 01:20.214
* No poker face,
no, you can't beat *

01:20.248 --> 01:21.449
* The Queen of Hearts
See, mother, that's--

01:21.482 --> 01:23.317
that's Tiana,
one of Empire's

01:23.351 --> 01:24.785
hottest pop stars.
Yes.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.720
I know who Tiana is, dear.
Okay.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.289
Mmm.
But why is she
prancing around

01:28.322 --> 01:29.923
with those tall,
skinny girls?

01:29.957 --> 01:31.725
Well, that's because
she's headlining

01:31.759 --> 01:34.628
the annual HVW Fashion Show.

01:34.662 --> 01:37.798
Yes, Helene Von Wyeth is
partnering with Empire.

01:37.831 --> 01:38.799
Really?

01:38.832 --> 01:40.601
* Aces high
ANGELO: One of Cookie's

01:40.634 --> 01:43.137
greatest achievements
has been aligning the company

01:43.171 --> 01:45.273
with high profile
cultural events, such as this.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.007
Are you bragging on me?

01:47.040 --> 01:48.276
(chuckling):
Yes, you know I am.

01:48.309 --> 01:49.643
(laughing)

01:49.677 --> 01:50.844
JAMAL:
Mom, can you please

01:50.878 --> 01:52.813
tell that fake A&R dude

01:52.846 --> 01:53.814
do not come in Studio B
Mm-mm.

01:53.847 --> 01:54.815
Mm.
when I'm rec...

01:54.848 --> 01:56.083
Oh, I'm sorry.
Mm, mm, mm.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.418
Hey. Excusez moi.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.253
How are you,
Mrs. Dubois?

01:59.287 --> 02:00.521
COOKIE:
Oh, come here, Jamal.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.089
I would like to
introduce you all

02:02.122 --> 02:04.158
to Helene Von Wyeth.

02:04.192 --> 02:06.427
Oh, but hold on
to your weave, honey.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.296
The first time I met her,
I wore Givenchy,

02:08.329 --> 02:09.797
she asked if I was a Kardashian.

02:09.830 --> 02:10.798
What?

02:10.831 --> 02:11.999
Are you feeble-minded

02:12.032 --> 02:13.867
or is my eight-year-old
daughter actually

02:13.901 --> 02:16.136
smarter than you?
How could one be

02:16.170 --> 02:17.505
so mor...
(gasps)

02:17.538 --> 02:18.672
Darling.

02:18.706 --> 02:21.609
Hey...
Darling, it's been too long.

02:21.642 --> 02:22.610
Oh...
DIANA: Mm.

02:22.643 --> 02:23.544
(kissing)

02:23.577 --> 02:25.012
So you know each other?

02:25.045 --> 02:27.381
Diana and I have sat on
many boards together.

02:27.415 --> 02:29.850
DIANA: I missed you at
the Barons Retreat.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.719
I was in Tangiers
with my father.

02:31.752 --> 02:34.021
Speaking of which,
why haven't I received

02:34.054 --> 02:36.123
my invitation for the
Captain's Ball yet?

02:36.156 --> 02:38.192
DIANA: Well, this year's ball's
gonna be a little different.

02:38.226 --> 02:40.160
It's gonna be a
fund-raiser for Angelo.

02:40.194 --> 02:42.029
In fact, Jamal...

02:42.062 --> 02:43.631
Yes.

02:43.664 --> 02:44.998
What are you doing
on the seventh of next month?

02:45.032 --> 02:46.200
HELENE:
Oh,

02:46.234 --> 02:47.401
that's a marvelous idea.

02:47.435 --> 02:49.870
A crossover
artist who also

02:49.903 --> 02:51.305
speaks to your core
constituency.

02:51.339 --> 02:53.507
* If you goin' all in

02:53.541 --> 02:55.509
* Money where your mouth is.

02:55.543 --> 02:56.877
(man whoops)

02:56.910 --> 02:58.078
Mother, please. All right,
you're crossing the line.

02:58.111 --> 02:59.980
Cookie has too much

03:00.013 --> 03:01.382
on her plate as it is.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.083
Look, I understand that, uh,

03:03.116 --> 03:05.052
it's important for us
to get Angelo elected

03:05.085 --> 03:06.887
into office, I get that.
But why don't I give you,

03:06.920 --> 03:08.589
um, other choices

03:08.622 --> 03:10.023
of Empire artists?
That's a great idea.

03:10.057 --> 03:11.725
That song that you
sang for your mother

03:11.759 --> 03:13.561
the other night at
dinner was everything.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.095
Thank you.

03:15.128 --> 03:17.030
I want you to write a song
for Angelo's campaign

03:17.064 --> 03:18.366
and I want you
Mama...

03:18.399 --> 03:20.234
to perform it at
the Captain's Ball.

03:20.268 --> 03:22.536
Before we settle on Jamal,

03:22.570 --> 03:25.339
I would like to offer you a list
of other Empire artists...

03:25.373 --> 03:27.741
Settle?
(laughs)

03:27.775 --> 03:30.077
Whoa, hold on, Mom.

03:30.110 --> 03:31.712
I'd, I would be honored.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.647
Thank you.
Thank you.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.950
It's time, Mom.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.085
It's now or never.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.225
*

03:51.231 --> 03:53.267
No.

03:53.301 --> 03:55.636
She said it, Rhonda, not Andre.

03:56.670 --> 03:59.640
She called me her family.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.041
She asked me...

04:01.074 --> 04:02.810
RHONDA:
But does she know

04:02.843 --> 04:04.912
who you really are?

04:07.281 --> 04:08.949
(gasps)
Hey!

04:11.785 --> 04:13.454
Dre, it's just me.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.956
Nessa, you can't sneak up on me
like that.

04:15.989 --> 04:16.990
(sighs)

04:17.991 --> 04:20.494
Are you okay, Dre?

04:20.528 --> 04:21.762
You were...

04:21.795 --> 04:23.130
talking in your sleep
last night and...

04:23.163 --> 04:24.998
I'm fine. I'm fine, okay?

04:25.032 --> 04:27.768
I'm just...

04:27.801 --> 04:29.403
Nessa,

04:29.437 --> 04:32.306
there's something I need
you to think about.

04:32.340 --> 04:33.507
Yeah.

04:33.541 --> 04:35.509
My father and I
just lined up

04:35.543 --> 04:37.411
a new round of funding
for Empire XStream.

04:37.445 --> 04:38.412
All right?

04:38.446 --> 04:40.213
Now, when that money hits...

04:41.782 --> 04:42.983
...we need to have
you positioned

04:43.016 --> 04:45.519
to take advantage of it.

04:45.553 --> 04:48.055
Let's, uh, let's talk about
what that's gonna mean.

04:53.561 --> 04:57.097
I see you haven't been
taking care of your nails.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.699
Well, that's 'cause
you ain't been here

04:58.732 --> 05:00.801
to take care of 'em for me.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.002
I'm stuck in this house

05:02.035 --> 05:04.171
with these crazy females,

05:04.204 --> 05:06.840
messing up my sanctuary.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.676
(door opens)
Where you been, anyway?

05:08.709 --> 05:10.310
(door closes)
I'll take it from here, thanks.

05:10.344 --> 05:11.545
Ah...
(clears throat)

05:11.579 --> 05:12.913
Can you give us a minute,
Tiffany?

05:16.417 --> 05:18.719
You want to get
your nails done?

05:18.752 --> 05:21.121
Nah, I'm more of a rub
and tug type. (chuckles)

05:21.154 --> 05:23.023
Listen,

05:23.056 --> 05:24.692
so far, we got nothin'.

05:24.725 --> 05:25.726
All right, no disrespect,

05:25.759 --> 05:27.127
but your cornball
half brother

05:27.160 --> 05:28.796
lives like a monk.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.798
Okay, he doesn't gamble,
no drugs,

05:30.831 --> 05:32.566
doesn't really drink, I mean,

05:32.600 --> 05:34.001
it's damn near insulting.

05:34.034 --> 05:37.004
I thought we had somebody
on the inside.

05:37.037 --> 05:39.006
We do. I mean, it took a little
time and money,

05:39.039 --> 05:40.007
but she's there.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.009
It's just Agent Sweetwater

05:42.042 --> 05:43.744
isn't in the inner circle.

05:43.777 --> 05:47.347
She thinks Tariq is
giving up on Shine

05:47.381 --> 05:49.383
and coming at you
on something new.

05:49.417 --> 05:50.851
She just doesn't know what yet.

05:52.853 --> 05:56.323
All right, then we need
to invade his crib.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.059
Destabilize his ass.

05:59.092 --> 06:02.095
Yeah, how? I mean,
the boy's not on the down low,

06:02.129 --> 06:04.698
doesn't use hookers...
I mean, I can't find any vices.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.534
Everybody's got a weakness.

06:07.801 --> 06:10.404
Find it.

06:10.438 --> 06:12.039
*

06:12.072 --> 06:13.173
* If you goin' all in

06:13.206 --> 06:15.042
* Money where your mouth is.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.244
This show is going
to be fabulous.

06:17.277 --> 06:18.712
We are going to
put a little bass in it,

06:18.746 --> 06:20.047
some black girl magic on it.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.249
I've seen Tiana
with straight hair,

06:22.282 --> 06:24.217
I'd like her to wear it
like that for our show.

06:24.251 --> 06:26.386
We could.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.255
It's not up
for discussion. Her...

06:28.288 --> 06:31.525
hair doesn't really go with the
aesthetic of the collection.

06:31.559 --> 06:34.428
It's all about sleekness
and geometry. And

06:34.462 --> 06:37.264
I'm thinking about
having her wear

06:37.297 --> 06:39.299
the final gown in the show.

06:39.332 --> 06:41.401
I think the others look
so gauche on her figure.

06:41.435 --> 06:42.603
That's, uh, too tight

06:42.636 --> 06:44.371
and it has a train.
(chuckles)

06:44.404 --> 06:46.774
That's not gonna work
with her choreography.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.609
(chuckles) Well,
I'm sure you can make it work.

06:48.642 --> 06:49.910
I mean, that
is depending

06:49.943 --> 06:51.745
how important it is
for you to bring Empire

06:51.779 --> 06:53.113
into the mainstream.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.414
Isn't that what
you're chasing

06:54.448 --> 06:56.083
with the Dubois family?

06:56.116 --> 06:57.150
Chasing?

06:57.184 --> 06:58.151
(laughing):
Oh, no, sweetie,

06:58.185 --> 06:59.152
you got it twisted.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.287
I didn't do the chasing there.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.789
Oh, I see.

07:01.822 --> 07:02.790
Well,

07:02.823 --> 07:04.758
nonetheless, I expect to be able

07:04.792 --> 07:07.127
to run a fine-tooth comb
through her hair

07:07.160 --> 07:08.662
by showtime.

07:08.696 --> 07:10.063
I'll run a fine-tooth comb

07:10.097 --> 07:11.398
up yo' ass, how 'bout that?

07:11.431 --> 07:13.233
All right,
think about what you want,

07:13.266 --> 07:14.301
and we'll talk
to Cookie directly.

07:14.334 --> 07:15.503
Exclusive club dates,

07:15.536 --> 07:17.170
features with some of
Empire's top artists?

07:17.204 --> 07:19.006
How are we gonna
follow your

07:19.039 --> 07:21.074
spectacular debut at the Empire
XStream launch, okay?

07:21.108 --> 07:22.075
* Money where my mouth is

07:22.109 --> 07:24.277
* I'm-a throw my aces high

07:24.311 --> 07:27.114
* I'm-a let you pay that price
tonight *

07:27.147 --> 07:29.282
* I'm-a throw my aces high

07:29.316 --> 07:30.584
* If you goin' all in

07:30.618 --> 07:33.320
* Money where your mouth is

07:39.192 --> 07:40.360
* If you goin' all in

07:40.393 --> 07:41.795
* Money where your mouth is

07:41.829 --> 07:43.463
*

07:48.736 --> 07:50.170
* If you goin' all in

07:50.203 --> 07:51.705
* Money where your mouth is

07:51.739 --> 07:53.306
What do I want?

07:53.340 --> 07:54.608
* Winning's all I know

07:54.642 --> 07:56.276
I want this.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.045
* No cameras

07:58.078 --> 07:59.847
* Please, I'm in my zone.

08:08.556 --> 08:09.523
(elevator bell dings)

08:09.557 --> 08:11.191
You're still mad at me.

08:11.224 --> 08:13.360
Well, I was counting on you,
Andre.

08:13.393 --> 08:15.529
Only son I have

08:15.563 --> 08:16.830
got something in common

08:16.864 --> 08:17.865
with Angelo's
bougie-ass mama.

08:17.898 --> 08:18.866
But it's all good.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.033
No, it's not all good.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.869
Mama, it's not
all good. Okay?

08:21.902 --> 08:22.870
(sighs)

08:22.903 --> 08:24.171
I'm sorry.

08:24.204 --> 08:25.305
I should've been
there for you, okay?

08:25.338 --> 08:26.574
If it makes a difference,

08:26.607 --> 08:27.708
I was doing the same thing
you were doing.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.142
What were you doing, Dre?

08:29.176 --> 08:30.243
I was meeting Nessa's family.

08:31.845 --> 08:35.048
It was the last thing
I ever expected, Ma.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.117
Oh, you really like her,
huh, Dre?

08:38.619 --> 08:42.656
I-I didn't, I didn't think
that it was possible.

08:42.690 --> 08:45.492
I'm starting to imagine myself
actually starting over.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.526
Is-is that wrong?

08:46.560 --> 08:48.395
No, baby, no.

08:48.428 --> 08:51.231
I want that for you more than
I want it for myself.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.266
(giggles)
Whatever you need.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.935
You know what would be great?

08:54.968 --> 08:56.704
What?
Can Nessa

08:56.737 --> 08:59.372
shadow Tiana for this
HVW Fashion Show?

08:59.406 --> 09:00.540
Mmm...

09:00.574 --> 09:02.242
She's new to
all this, Mom.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.144
She could really learn
a lot from Tiana.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.780
Okay.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.348
(laughing)

09:08.381 --> 09:09.750
Mom...
You have Nessa

09:09.783 --> 09:12.419
come to Tiana's fitting,
but she better

09:12.452 --> 09:15.022
come correct, 'cause
that daggone Tiana,

09:15.055 --> 09:16.690
she is nervous
about this performance.

09:16.724 --> 09:17.758
You won't even know
she's there, Ma.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.026
I love you.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.560
I love you.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.902
Oh, good. You can hang that
right up there.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.238
How does Helene expect me

09:31.271 --> 09:33.941
to perform in that?
And she wants me to

09:33.974 --> 09:36.644
straighten my hair, too.
Like, for what?
Child,

09:36.677 --> 09:38.879
you just do what they ask you
to do and get them coins.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.948
Why would I do it? I'm Empire's
biggest digital star, Ma.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.416
You know that.
But you're not a bigger
crossover star than Tiana,

09:43.450 --> 09:45.318
and y'all fans love when y'all
perform together.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.319
Don't be like that, boy.

09:46.353 --> 09:47.721
What's going on?

09:47.755 --> 09:49.757
Well...
Hakeem is going to

09:49.790 --> 09:52.760
rerecord all of Gram's tracks
on your album.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.795
End of story.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.063
That's a good idea,
you want to know why?

09:56.096 --> 09:57.097
'Cause Black Twitter,
they gonna freak out,

09:57.130 --> 09:58.131
just like how they do

09:58.165 --> 09:59.432
when Rihanna and Drake
in the same city.

09:59.466 --> 10:01.735
No. Hell no. You guys

10:01.769 --> 10:04.304
are not gonna try to use
me to resurrect his ass

10:04.337 --> 10:07.074
after he got dumped live
on his own channel by her.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.441
Okay, excuse me, Nessa,

10:08.475 --> 10:09.777
can you give us
a minute, please?
Yeah, yeah.

10:09.810 --> 10:10.844
Thank you.

10:12.545 --> 10:15.783
Tiana, Porsha is
right for a change.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.584
Once y'all get together
and do your magic,

10:17.617 --> 10:19.419
everybody's gonna
forget that nonsense

10:19.452 --> 10:20.854
he said about you, girl.

10:20.888 --> 10:21.989
You were slumming
with that clown, anyway.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.256
As opposed to you

10:23.290 --> 10:25.292
and all your
little side pieces?

10:25.325 --> 10:26.760
Is there any B-list singer

10:26.794 --> 10:29.096
left in the game that
you haven't smashed?

10:29.129 --> 10:31.331
Maybe one of the "who" models
you been lezzing out with.

10:31.364 --> 10:32.933
You know, catching off-brand
rappers for fame, baby...

10:32.966 --> 10:33.934
Come on, y'all,

10:33.967 --> 10:34.968
cut it out!

10:35.002 --> 10:36.369
Well, I'm going to
leave you to this

10:36.403 --> 10:39.006
while I go and do something
equally unpleasant.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.608
I've got to have tea
over at Archibald's

10:41.641 --> 10:43.376
with Leah and Anika.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.946
(chuckles) Well, I hope
the butter knife is dull.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.648
(chuckling)

10:48.682 --> 10:50.684
(classical music playing)

10:55.923 --> 10:57.725
Dwight, where's my crusts?

10:57.758 --> 11:00.093
Make him bring
my crusts back.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.232
Can you go in the kitchen
and see if somebody

11:05.265 --> 11:06.666
can get this woman
some crusts?

11:06.700 --> 11:08.902
Right away.
Thank you.

11:08.936 --> 11:11.705
Done.

11:11.739 --> 11:14.174
Now let's discuss how
we're all gonna live together

11:14.207 --> 11:15.743
under the same roof

11:15.776 --> 11:17.811
without killing each other.

11:17.845 --> 11:21.681
Well, I was supposed
to be Shine's head of A&R,

11:21.715 --> 11:23.483
so maybe that would have
gotten me out of the house

11:23.516 --> 11:25.518
and made all of this just
a little bit more tolerable.

11:25.552 --> 11:27.855
LUCIOUS: Well, that's
not happening now that

11:27.888 --> 11:30.690
Andre and Nessa
are together, so...

11:30.724 --> 11:32.726
So just keep her far
away from me, okay?

11:32.760 --> 11:34.995
And I do mean far away,
which means that

11:35.028 --> 11:36.229
you stay out of the nursery,

11:36.263 --> 11:37.664
stay out of my bathroom,

11:37.697 --> 11:39.099
and stay out of
my dressing room, okay?

11:39.132 --> 11:40.567
Because I see you putting on
my ruby lipstick.

11:41.634 --> 11:44.671
What did I tell you
was gonna happen to you

11:44.704 --> 11:46.539
if you keep disrespecting
her boundaries?

11:46.573 --> 11:49.242
I'm not going back
in that awful room

11:49.276 --> 11:51.244
that you locked me
and Andre in!

11:51.278 --> 11:53.446
(loudly): That dungeon
where you starved me!

11:53.480 --> 11:55.182
Keep your voice down!

11:55.215 --> 11:57.184
You're hurting me. Let go!
I'm not gonna tell you...

11:57.217 --> 11:58.685
You're hurting me!

11:58.718 --> 11:59.686
Let go!

11:59.719 --> 12:01.021
Let go.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.756
TARIQ (over radio):
I'm goin' in.

12:02.790 --> 12:04.224
HUGHES:
Sir, sir.

12:04.257 --> 12:07.761
You're gonna blow
our whole surveillance detail.

12:07.795 --> 12:09.462
I've gotta get her out
of that house, Hughes.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.631
They hate each other.
It's an abusive situation.

12:11.664 --> 12:12.900
Well, if they hate
each other so much,

12:12.933 --> 12:13.901
maybe there's a way to use that.

12:13.934 --> 12:16.236
Yeah. Turn her.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.771
I've thought about that.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.572
I don't know.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.241
She's an old woman.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.143
A mentally ill old woman.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.577
But, hey...

12:24.611 --> 12:26.479
(chuckles):
...it'd serve Lucious right

12:26.513 --> 12:27.848
to turn his own mother
against him.

12:40.794 --> 12:43.163
Like, seriously, I can't
do anything in this.

12:43.196 --> 12:45.665
I mean, it-it's long,
but I think it's cute.

12:45.698 --> 12:47.134
What you think?
It's cute, right?

12:47.167 --> 12:48.635
Mm-mm.
No, you drunk.
You don't know.

12:48.668 --> 12:50.270
You know what?
I'm gonna get the seamstress.

12:50.303 --> 12:51.738
I'll be right back.
Hold on.

12:51.771 --> 12:52.973
Nessa, can you help me
get out of this, please?

12:53.006 --> 12:54.441
Yeah. sure.
PORSHA: Hey,

12:54.474 --> 12:56.176
can somebody get me
a seamstress, please?

12:56.209 --> 12:57.510
I swear...
WOMAN: I'm on it.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.446
PORSHA: Thank you.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.849
Okay, she on her way, so
don't even worry about it.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.984
You know what? After we leave
here, we gonna turn up.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.285
We gonna, gonna get you
a little something,

13:05.318 --> 13:06.820
'cause you're
a little uptight...

13:06.854 --> 13:09.089
But you don't understand that
this performance is big.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.924
Like, it needs
to be perfect.
I hear you, but that's why

13:10.958 --> 13:13.026
I'm here. You know,
whatever you need help with,

13:13.060 --> 13:15.829
I got you, just chill.
Hold on, hold on,
is something burning?

13:16.663 --> 13:19.032
PORSHA:
Oh, Nessa!

13:19.066 --> 13:20.533
Oh, Nessa, what did you do?

13:20.567 --> 13:22.635
Oh, my God.

13:22.669 --> 13:24.037
Nessa!

13:24.071 --> 13:25.538
I'm s....
Really?

13:25.572 --> 13:27.174
Oh, my...
What did you do?

13:27.207 --> 13:28.976
NESSA: It was
an accident, Tiana.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.011
I'm sorry, I'll
get you another one.
How?!

13:31.044 --> 13:33.313
This is couture.
There isn't another!

13:33.346 --> 13:35.648
Well, just tell me
what I need to do.
(loud clattering)

13:35.682 --> 13:37.317
What is wrong with you?
Are you stupid?

13:37.350 --> 13:38.952
Are you stupid?

13:38.986 --> 13:41.521
Helene Von Wyeth will
destroy me for this!

13:41.554 --> 13:43.023
That bitch didn't even
want me in her stupid

13:43.056 --> 13:44.491
whitewashed show to begin with.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.493
The only reason
she teamed up with Empire

13:46.526 --> 13:48.161
is because she got
dragged out for doing

13:48.195 --> 13:49.796
some wack-ass
Out of Africa collection

13:49.829 --> 13:51.398
with no black people in it.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.500
Then homegirl tries to
shove me in this damn dress

13:53.533 --> 13:55.302
meant for some anorexic
white chick.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.905
That skinny, racist bitch
can't handle my realness!

13:57.938 --> 13:59.472
And now she's gonna
say I burned

13:59.506 --> 14:01.308
that raggedy-ass rag
on purpose.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.043
What is wrong with you?
Okay, okay, Tiana,
you know what?

14:03.076 --> 14:04.544
We gonna take care
of this, a'ight?

14:04.577 --> 14:07.580
You know what,
Nessa, fix it, now!
Yeah, yeah.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.416
I'm sorry.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.500
(phones ringing)

14:27.534 --> 14:30.070
Yes, sign right here
and right here.

14:34.241 --> 14:37.177
What are you doing here?
It's okay, it's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.079
Where's my doctor?
Miss Leah, I'm not
here to hurt you.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.948
I'm not here to hurt you.
Miss Leah, I'm here to help you.

14:40.981 --> 14:44.217
Miss Leah, look,
I know Lucious was...

14:44.251 --> 14:46.019
Dwight was trying
to hurt you,

14:46.053 --> 14:48.388
and lock you away in a dungeon
and treat you like a prisoner.

14:48.421 --> 14:49.689
How do you know that?

14:49.722 --> 14:51.091
I have eyes and ears
in a lot of places.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.493
I'm a lawman, remember?
I'm one of the good guys.

14:55.095 --> 14:58.265
Now, come on.
Sit back down.

15:01.768 --> 15:03.937
I'm not gonna let Dwight
hurt you anymore.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.640
And I'm gonna make sure
you get out that house

15:07.674 --> 15:10.143
so you and Anika
don't fight so much.

15:10.177 --> 15:15.082
That light bright wife
of his, she's evil.

15:15.115 --> 15:16.483
Dwight hates her.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.551
I know.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.420
And if you can
help me prove it,

15:20.453 --> 15:21.989
we can make her go away.

15:27.627 --> 15:28.828
COOKIE: How in the hell did this
get on the Internet already?

15:28.861 --> 15:30.297
TIANA (on computer):
Are you stupid?

15:30.330 --> 15:32.499
Helene Von Wyeth will
destroy me for this!

15:32.532 --> 15:33.933
That bitch didn't even
want me in her stupid

15:33.967 --> 15:35.402
whitewashed show to begin with.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.737
The only reason
she teamed up with Empire

15:37.770 --> 15:39.306
is because she got
dragged out for doing

15:39.339 --> 15:41.241
some wack-ass
Out of Africa collection

15:41.274 --> 15:42.775
with no black people in it.

15:42.809 --> 15:44.344
Then homegirl...

15:44.377 --> 15:45.845
How could you
let this happen?

15:45.878 --> 15:47.914
Wh... It was people
walking in and out.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.616
I don't know who
recorded this.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.318
And it ain't like
she said nothin' wrong.

15:51.351 --> 15:54.154
Nessa feels terrible,
Mom, truly.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.689
Oh, well, that makes
everything better.

15:56.723 --> 15:59.492
Don't nobody give a damn
about how Nessa feels!

15:59.526 --> 16:01.861
I gotta get ahold of Helene.
She's not answering my calls.

16:01.894 --> 16:03.796
I can't take this
anymore, Cookie.

16:03.830 --> 16:06.633
First Gram, and now this.
They're calling me a diva.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.768
Look, Tiana,
we will take care of this.

16:08.801 --> 16:12.372
HVW needs Empire just as much as
we need them, don't you worry.

16:12.405 --> 16:15.608
And it ain't no worse than
Kanye West going off on SNL,

16:15.642 --> 16:17.944
or that girl with the ponytail
lickin' on the doughnut.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.047
I'm gonna need you to shut up.
This is my fault, Mom.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.848
I should be the one
to talk to Helene.

16:21.881 --> 16:24.851
I know how to give her cover
on the racial allegations.

16:24.884 --> 16:27.454
And I can make a really strong
case for working this out.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.056
Hell, I'll even sweeten
the streaming deal

16:29.089 --> 16:30.790
and throw in two more
of Empire's points

16:30.823 --> 16:32.192
for broadcast rights.

16:32.225 --> 16:34.161
How about that?

16:34.194 --> 16:37.330
I like the way
your Wharton brain thinks.

16:37.364 --> 16:40.300
If you can make this
go away for Tiana,

16:40.333 --> 16:43.503
I will forgive you
for missing my dinner.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.838
I promise.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.077
(sighs)

16:54.614 --> 16:58.085
The performance is important,
and I gotta get through it.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.353
What is all this?
I'm glad you asked.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.689
Virtual reality is
the next new tech toy.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.357
And it's gaining
its credence

17:04.391 --> 17:08.228
as a PTSD
therapy treatment.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.597
So we're gonna use it
to expose you

17:10.630 --> 17:12.899
to all the sights and sounds
that you were hit with

17:12.932 --> 17:15.868
leading up to the moments
before you were shot.

17:15.902 --> 17:19.672
I'll build up
a tolerance, and...

17:19.706 --> 17:21.708
I'll be able to get
back onstage, right?

17:21.741 --> 17:22.909
Exactly.
That's the plan.

17:22.942 --> 17:24.944
Have you used
VR glasses before?

17:24.977 --> 17:28.248
Hakeem had, like,
the very first headset.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.350
I used to kick
those monsters' asses.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.718
(chuckles):
Okay.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.353
Well, these are gonna
put you onstage

17:33.386 --> 17:34.854
in front of an audience.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.556
PHILIP: So nice and slow,
little by little,

17:36.589 --> 17:38.425
I'm gonna introduce
your triggers,

17:38.458 --> 17:40.026
increasing the amount
of people,

17:40.059 --> 17:41.561
the lights, and the sound,

17:41.594 --> 17:43.029
while I'm tracking
your physical responses

17:43.062 --> 17:44.597
to make sure I'm not
pushing you too fast.

17:44.631 --> 17:47.066
No, no, this is amazing.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.936
PHILIP:
Okay.

17:49.969 --> 17:52.239
Start to play.

17:54.674 --> 17:57.677
*

18:04.784 --> 18:06.953
(cheering)

18:06.986 --> 18:10.123
*

18:10.157 --> 18:12.659
AUDIENCE:
Jamal! Jamal! Jamal!

18:16.996 --> 18:19.266
(panting)

18:19.299 --> 18:20.667
Um...

18:24.671 --> 18:26.673
So damn real.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.341
Do you want to stop?
No, no, no.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.943
Um... let's keep going.

18:30.977 --> 18:32.579
Come on.
Okay.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.281
You're doing great.
Just stay in it.
All right.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.650
Okay.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.321
I'm gonna introduce
the next stimulus.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.256
*

18:43.290 --> 18:45.425
(camera shutters clicking)

18:45.458 --> 18:46.426
(gunshot)

18:46.459 --> 18:48.828
*

18:54.701 --> 18:56.803
What in the hell you got
my son hooked up to?

18:56.836 --> 18:59.272
*

18:59.306 --> 19:00.540
(audience cheering)
LUCIOUS: Jamal!

19:02.809 --> 19:05.778
Jamal, what in the hell
are y'all doin' here?

19:05.812 --> 19:07.113
What, you got electricity

19:07.146 --> 19:09.015
running through
your nipples now?

19:09.048 --> 19:10.983
What is this about?

19:11.984 --> 19:13.486
Dad, what you doin' here?

19:13.520 --> 19:15.922
I hear you
helping Angelo now?

19:17.324 --> 19:20.159
You're gonna do the
Dubois Captain's Ball?

19:20.193 --> 19:21.561
Is that right?

19:21.594 --> 19:24.063
That's a mighty
big event, son.

19:24.096 --> 19:25.898
You sure you're ready
for something like that?

19:27.166 --> 19:28.835
Let me guess.

19:28.868 --> 19:31.204
You came all this way to
make sure that I couldn't do it.

19:31.238 --> 19:32.839
Wait a minute,
I'm not the one

19:32.872 --> 19:34.140
trying to exploit you

19:34.173 --> 19:36.209
for my boyfriend's
political gain.

19:36.243 --> 19:39.246
That's your mama.
I'm in your corner.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.881
I've been telling you
you need to get your ass

19:41.914 --> 19:43.383
back on that stage.

19:43.416 --> 19:44.584
But that song you played

19:44.617 --> 19:46.419
the other day
at your mama's house

19:46.453 --> 19:47.920
about me and her
and all of that--

19:47.954 --> 19:50.523
I don't ever want
to hear that again.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.825
And if you know
what's right for you,

19:52.859 --> 19:54.494
you're gonna make
sure you're 100%

19:54.527 --> 19:55.862
before you hop on that stage
in front of

19:55.895 --> 19:57.530
all them hoity-toity people.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.098
'Cause if you fail again,

19:59.131 --> 20:01.167
that's one, two,
three strikes,

20:01.200 --> 20:02.402
you're out.

20:02.435 --> 20:03.836
No more Empire.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.573
You're an independent artist.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.775
How's that for motivation?

20:11.744 --> 20:14.046
Write a song about that.

20:21.388 --> 20:22.889
Come on.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.123
Your vitals jumped
through the roof

20:24.156 --> 20:25.925
the minute he walked
in the door.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.760
Philip, I don't even
know what that means.
Come on, let's just go.

20:27.794 --> 20:29.429
It means I've been
throwing everything at you--

20:29.462 --> 20:31.130
lights, crowds, gunfire.

20:31.163 --> 20:32.965
I even threw images
of Freda Gatz in there.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.301
And you were handling
all of that

20:34.334 --> 20:36.903
until he stepped in,
and you heard his voice.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.606
Lucious is your PTSD trigger.

20:39.639 --> 20:42.241
Man, Lucious is everybody's
damn PTSD trigger.

20:42.275 --> 20:43.743
You trippin'.

20:43.776 --> 20:44.944
Look, as long as
he's not there,

20:44.977 --> 20:46.613
I'm gonna be fine.
Let's go.

20:46.646 --> 20:49.115
No. You jumped in front
of a bullet to save the life

20:49.148 --> 20:50.983
of a man that's got you all
twisted up inside.
He's my father.

20:51.017 --> 20:53.286
But everybody wants to talk
about it. All right, come on.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.555
You're gonna have to
work through this with him.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.824
Otherwise, you're never gonna
get back on that stage.

21:07.133 --> 21:10.102
ANDRE: It was one stressed-out,
immature artist.

21:10.136 --> 21:11.838
We shouldn't let this
drive a wedge between

21:11.871 --> 21:13.340
our two companies,
Helene.

21:13.373 --> 21:15.174
Do you know how many
black people I've employed

21:15.207 --> 21:17.577
during my lifetime?

21:17.610 --> 21:19.412
If I were...

21:19.446 --> 21:21.948
If I were a racist,
would I let her play

21:21.981 --> 21:24.150
with Michael Strahan's girls?

21:24.183 --> 21:27.086
(scoffs): They've been swimming
in my pool, for God's sakes.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.255
I'm telling you, the best way to
do damage control for your image

21:29.288 --> 21:31.991
would be to not break ties with
Empire, especially this late

21:32.024 --> 21:33.326
in the game.
Do you have any idea

21:33.360 --> 21:34.794
how mortifying
this has been for me?

21:34.827 --> 21:38.765
All the girls in her
class idolize Tiana.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.700
* I got a body like a weapon

21:40.733 --> 21:42.001
* It goes ba-ba-bang

21:42.034 --> 21:43.436
Uh, yes.
* Bang, bang.

21:43.470 --> 21:45.638
Charming.
Enough of that.
(chuckles)

21:45.672 --> 21:48.007
I don't blame you
for refusing to work with Tiana.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.477
I get it, okay?

21:50.510 --> 21:52.479
What about another
Empire artist?

21:52.512 --> 21:55.314
Who?
Tiana's a crossover artist.

21:55.348 --> 21:58.351
What if you were to choose
someone more definitively urban?

21:58.385 --> 22:00.787
Say, an up-and-coming
soul singer. Now, that...

22:00.820 --> 22:02.722
would make
a very strong statement.

22:02.755 --> 22:05.725
An unknown?
Who's more culturally aware.

22:05.758 --> 22:07.960
Come on, who's more black.
Right?

22:07.994 --> 22:10.062
Veronica might be
a little too old.

22:10.096 --> 22:12.131
Maybe somebody like, uh...

22:12.164 --> 22:13.533
Nessa Parker.

22:13.566 --> 22:15.635
Interesting.

22:15.668 --> 22:16.803
(inhales)

22:16.836 --> 22:18.671
(exhales)
But no.

22:18.705 --> 22:22.141
I think we're gonna see if Ellie
Goulding is still available.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.843
Now, she has the right look.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.878
You mean the white look.

22:25.912 --> 22:28.214
A preference

22:28.247 --> 22:30.683
is not a prejudice.

22:30.717 --> 22:32.018
(chuckles)

22:32.051 --> 22:35.755
You people expect change
to happen overnight.

22:35.788 --> 22:37.890
The HVW Fashion Show

22:37.924 --> 22:39.692
has always been associated

22:39.726 --> 22:41.928
with a certain
level of class.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.062
That's all.

22:43.095 --> 22:45.364
I hear you.

22:45.398 --> 22:47.266
Loud and clear.

22:48.300 --> 22:49.536
(clears throat)

22:53.372 --> 22:55.742
You know,

22:55.775 --> 22:58.778
your daughter has
such beautiful hair.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.952
I see why you love it.

23:05.985 --> 23:07.353
Hmm.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.822
*

23:12.792 --> 23:14.761
(phones ringing)

23:14.794 --> 23:15.962
NURSE:
Leah Walker?

23:15.995 --> 23:18.397
The doctor will
see you now.

23:19.666 --> 23:22.234
It's a gynecologist.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.080
I did just like you said.

23:34.113 --> 23:37.083
I told Dwight I was
having a procedure.

23:37.116 --> 23:39.786
Some kind of woman's thing.
He didn't ask no questions.

23:40.987 --> 23:42.254
We'll go out back.

23:45.525 --> 23:46.726
(car horn beeps in distance)

23:46.759 --> 23:48.394
Dwight won't let me go anywhere

23:48.427 --> 23:50.830
without Frick and Frack
watching my every move.

23:50.863 --> 23:52.465
Yeah. They'll be expecting
you back soon.

23:52.499 --> 23:54.333
So, do you think
you can get into his office?

23:54.366 --> 23:55.968
Sodom and Gomorrah.

23:56.002 --> 23:59.005
They do dirty, nasty sex.

24:00.707 --> 24:03.109
You mean, uh, Lucious and Anika
are sleeping together.

24:03.142 --> 24:06.145
I don't know no husband and
wife that go at it like that.

24:06.178 --> 24:08.180
Certainly not my Joe.

24:08.214 --> 24:11.017
Maybe he did that with
your mama, 'cause she was

24:11.050 --> 24:13.352
nasty like Anika.

24:16.322 --> 24:19.325
You remind me
of him, you know.

24:19.358 --> 24:21.994
*

24:22.028 --> 24:23.696
What was he like?

24:23.730 --> 24:24.864
My father?

24:24.897 --> 24:27.166
Joe Walker.

24:27.199 --> 24:29.702
I spent my whole life
wishing I'd known him.

24:37.910 --> 24:39.912
(classical music playing)

24:44.751 --> 24:45.985
(grunts)

24:47.854 --> 24:49.556
No... No!

24:49.589 --> 24:51.023
(screaming):
Mommy!

24:51.057 --> 24:53.359
What? What? What is going on?
(screaming)

24:53.392 --> 24:55.227
No!
What...? God.

24:55.261 --> 24:56.829
Oh, my God!

24:56.863 --> 24:59.732
(screaming)
No! Stop! Oh, my God!

25:03.770 --> 25:05.772
* Hey

25:06.839 --> 25:08.240
* Hey

25:10.543 --> 25:11.911
* Hey.

25:13.613 --> 25:15.848
So, you planned
this whole thing,

25:15.882 --> 25:17.817
right from the jump.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.586
Is that right?

25:19.619 --> 25:22.221
Except you wasn't as smart
as you thought you was.

25:22.254 --> 25:24.657
See, there was a camera
right where Tiana said
Nessa was standing.

25:24.691 --> 25:26.759
That skinny, racist bitch
can't handle my realness!

25:26.793 --> 25:28.227
And now she's gonna say I burned

25:28.260 --> 25:30.162
this raggedy-ass rag
on purpose!

25:30.196 --> 25:32.431
TIANA: What is wrong with you?
Congratulations, Nancy Drew.

25:32.464 --> 25:34.667
So you admit it?
What am I admitting?

25:34.701 --> 25:36.268
It's all right there on TMI.

25:36.302 --> 25:38.037
Tiana ran
her pretty little mouth off

25:38.070 --> 25:40.039
and screwed herself
out of a great opportunity.

25:40.072 --> 25:41.540
Ain't got nothing to do with me.

25:41.574 --> 25:42.742
Well, I hope you know
I'm not promoting

25:42.775 --> 25:44.443
none of those records
I did with Nessa.

25:44.476 --> 25:46.746
Oh, you bet your ass you will.
It's in the contract.

25:46.779 --> 25:48.447
You're not gonna get away
with it, bro.

25:50.382 --> 25:53.185
Why you trying
to fight me over Tiana?

25:53.219 --> 25:54.787
You feeling her again?

25:54.821 --> 25:57.624
After Nessa rejected you?
Your feelings hurt?

25:57.657 --> 25:59.191
Let's hurt 'em up.
(laughs)

25:59.225 --> 26:01.127
(grunting)
Get off!

26:01.160 --> 26:02.261
(both arguing indistinctly)

26:02.294 --> 26:03.796
Yeah, careful, baby brother,

26:03.830 --> 26:06.365
or I might have
to get at Tiana, too.

26:06.398 --> 26:07.566
(laughs)

26:07.600 --> 26:09.736
Mm.

26:09.769 --> 26:12.872
(panting)

26:12.905 --> 26:15.374
You gonna learn.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.409
Just wait, Dre.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.311
*

26:19.345 --> 26:21.247
Been waitin', baby.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.615
(spits)

26:22.649 --> 26:24.550
Have a good day.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.386
(sirens wailing in distance)

26:27.419 --> 26:29.388
I get it... about Tiana.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.457
It's a shame, but I get it.

26:31.490 --> 26:33.492
Now I have to find
someone else to put up

26:33.525 --> 26:36.428
on that stage--
a seasoned performer, though.

26:36.462 --> 26:39.632
I'm thinking Veronica,
or maybe, um...

26:39.666 --> 26:41.500
I think we should go
with Nessa Parker.

26:42.769 --> 26:44.570
How do you even know Nessa?
Oh,

26:44.603 --> 26:45.972
Nessa has a fresh face,

26:46.005 --> 26:48.941
and she's an authentic
soul singer.

26:48.975 --> 26:51.177
And I think it sends
the right message.

26:51.210 --> 26:54.747
Especially after Tiana's
offensive tirade.

26:54.781 --> 26:56.515
So, you don't want to...

26:56.548 --> 26:58.184
straighten her hair?

26:58.217 --> 26:59.618
Absolutely not.

26:59.652 --> 27:01.120
No. I think we go with...

27:01.153 --> 27:02.989
Now, how did you put it, um...?

27:03.022 --> 27:06.092
Drop some bass tonight.

27:06.125 --> 27:09.161
And have, uh,
black girl magic on it.

27:12.164 --> 27:14.266
* People talk
about the way I am *

27:14.300 --> 27:16.335
* Natural hair
and my chocolatey skin *

27:16.368 --> 27:18.805
* Walk is crazy,
see it in my hips *

27:18.838 --> 27:20.840
* Ain't nothing like a woman
with some nice, full lips *

27:20.873 --> 27:23.976
* I'm proud to say
I'm from the motherland *

27:24.010 --> 27:26.345
That's a good look right there.
* Nappy hair,
yes, it ain't so bad *

27:26.378 --> 27:28.881
* 'Cause now they all want
the braids and the dreadlocks *

27:28.915 --> 27:31.350
* Paying money just to get
the curves that I got *

27:31.383 --> 27:33.385
* That's why I keep
my head up high *

27:33.419 --> 27:35.621
* Elevated

27:35.654 --> 27:38.657
* Rock your curls,

27:38.691 --> 27:40.827
* Celebrate it

* You feeling that,
oh, yeah, you feel it? *

27:48.367 --> 27:49.836
* I feel it, girl, hey

27:49.869 --> 27:52.138
* So, if you're with me,
hey, hey, hey *

27:52.171 --> 27:54.540
* Dance right on with me,
hey, hey, hey *

27:54.573 --> 27:56.208
* 'Cause there ain't nothing
like it *

27:56.242 --> 27:57.877
* That black girl magic

27:57.910 --> 27:59.645
* Cast my spell right on you

27:59.678 --> 28:01.814
* I know you're with me,
hey, hey, hey *

28:01.848 --> 28:04.316
* He wanna come and get me,
hey, hey, hey *

28:04.350 --> 28:07.419
* 'Cause there ain't nothing
like it, that black girl magic *

28:07.453 --> 28:10.389
* Watch me now, what I do

28:10.422 --> 28:12.258
* Black girl magic

28:13.425 --> 28:14.894
* Black girl magic

28:14.927 --> 28:17.363
* Queen so divine
from the holy land *

28:17.396 --> 28:19.398
* Darker than the berry,
that's that melanin *

28:19.431 --> 28:21.901
* Like a goddess
with a history *

28:21.934 --> 28:24.336
* Of beauty and strength,
yeah, that's all me *

28:24.370 --> 28:26.939
* Grow a nation
from all my roots, ah *

28:26.973 --> 28:29.375
* Supplement it
with the sweetest fruits, ah *

28:29.408 --> 28:31.744
* Royal blood runnin'
through my veins *

28:31.778 --> 28:34.346
* So, don't you forget
I was made this way *

28:34.380 --> 28:37.349
* That's why I keep
my head up high *

28:37.383 --> 28:39.018
* Elevated

28:39.051 --> 28:41.553
* Rock your curls,

28:49.128 --> 28:51.397
What'd I tell you? It turned
out great, didn't it?

28:51.430 --> 28:52.631
(Nessa laughs)

28:52.664 --> 28:53.866
* So, if you're with me

28:53.900 --> 28:55.868
I'm glad we found common ground.

28:55.902 --> 28:58.070
* With me, hey, hey, hey

28:58.104 --> 29:00.439
* 'Cause there ain't nothing
like it, that black girl magic *

29:00.472 --> 29:02.074
TIANA:
Ugh!

29:02.108 --> 29:03.910
I knew that bitch was shady.

29:03.943 --> 29:06.078
I should've never
let her shadow me.

29:06.112 --> 29:07.479
* Hey, hey, hey

29:07.513 --> 29:10.149
No worries. It ain't over.

29:10.182 --> 29:11.784
All right?

29:11.818 --> 29:14.053
Here.
Thanks.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.988
I mean, look at that.
I could've done that.

29:16.022 --> 29:17.756
* Black girl magic

29:17.790 --> 29:21.593
* Whoo, no, they can't keep
their eyes off you *

29:21.627 --> 29:24.263
Come on, let's watch
something else, yeah?

29:24.296 --> 29:26.765
* Magic when you enter
the room *

29:26.799 --> 29:28.000
* No, no, no, no.

29:28.034 --> 29:29.301
(beeps)

29:29.335 --> 29:30.602
Yo, play Creed.

29:30.636 --> 29:32.371
FEMALE AUTOMATED VOICE:
Playing Creed.

29:35.474 --> 29:37.643
Listen, T.

29:37.676 --> 29:39.645
We're Empire's original
power couple.

29:39.678 --> 29:42.949
Not Andre and that bobblehead.

29:42.982 --> 29:46.285
We'll get back
at the both of them.

29:46.318 --> 29:47.353
I promise.

29:47.386 --> 29:49.388
*

30:01.667 --> 30:03.802
Uh, what are you doing?

30:03.836 --> 30:05.671
I got a daughter now.

30:05.704 --> 30:08.140
I got to practice.

30:11.577 --> 30:14.513
ANGELO:
You and Jamal bring energy
like that to the Captain's Ball,

30:14.546 --> 30:16.782
they'll be calling me
His Honor in no time.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.150
Yeah. Well, Jamal is geeked

30:18.184 --> 30:19.952
'cause he has something
really big planned.

30:19.986 --> 30:22.354
That was amazing.
Like that?

30:22.388 --> 30:24.523
Good to see you.
Good to see you, darling.

30:24.556 --> 30:27.059
Helene. This show gets
better every year.

30:27.093 --> 30:28.827
And this Empire
collaboration

30:28.861 --> 30:30.329
is a stroke of genius.

30:30.362 --> 30:31.530
Get away from them
while you can.

30:31.563 --> 30:34.133
Helene, you're shaking.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.302
The music, the violent lyrics.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.204
It's not just for show, Diana.

30:38.237 --> 30:41.040
The Lyons are actual gangsters.

30:41.073 --> 30:43.342
You cannot have
Angelo associate with them.

30:44.576 --> 30:45.744
Excuse me.

30:45.777 --> 30:48.580
Yes, darling.
I see you. Yes...

30:48.614 --> 30:50.616
*

30:56.588 --> 30:58.724
* Peep out my demeanor

30:58.757 --> 31:00.559
'Sup, Dre?
WAITRESS:
Drink up?

31:00.592 --> 31:02.428
Sure.

31:02.461 --> 31:04.496
I got to give it to you.
Thank you.

31:04.530 --> 31:08.234
You didn't leave anything on
that stage tonight, young lady.

31:08.267 --> 31:10.502
Thank you.
This was just the beginning.

31:10.536 --> 31:11.904
Yeah. I'm starting
to get that feeling.

31:11.938 --> 31:13.906
(gasps)
Can you excuse us for a second?

31:13.940 --> 31:15.607
I need to talk to your manager.

31:15.641 --> 31:17.776
Yes. We need to talk

31:17.809 --> 31:18.844
about your next steps.

31:18.877 --> 31:19.878
Of course.
Yes.

31:19.912 --> 31:22.381
Be proud.

31:22.414 --> 31:24.450
* YSL for the smell,
Cali Kush... *

31:24.483 --> 31:28.554
(sighs) Andre, I am all for you
getting on with your life.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.589
But what you did
to Tiana ain't cool.

31:30.622 --> 31:32.124
What does it matter?

31:32.158 --> 31:34.193
I saved the day for Empire...
It matters

31:34.226 --> 31:35.561
that you lied to me.

31:35.594 --> 31:37.696
And it matters

31:37.729 --> 31:39.631
that you're changing in some way

31:39.665 --> 31:42.234
that I'm not sure
I got a handle on.
Hey.

31:42.268 --> 31:44.270
I am up, okay?

31:44.303 --> 31:46.705
I'm awake. I'm blessed.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.607
That's all. Okay?

31:48.640 --> 31:49.976
* Talkin' fresh swag

31:50.009 --> 31:52.811
* Peep out my demeanor

31:52.844 --> 31:55.847
* I need a bad one,
something like a diva, what? *

32:00.686 --> 32:02.688
(crickets chirping)

32:10.162 --> 32:12.498
What do you think you're doing?

32:12.531 --> 32:15.067
Redecorating.

32:15.101 --> 32:19.005
I mean, isn't that what
the go housewives do?

32:19.038 --> 32:20.973
You know, the ones
who don't have jobs?

32:21.007 --> 32:23.509
I'm not in the mood
for this right now!

32:23.542 --> 32:25.611
You keep breaking stuff,
I'm-a whup...

32:25.644 --> 32:27.179
That cost me $200,000

32:27.213 --> 32:28.747
at auction.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.382
Put it back.
Okay.

32:33.519 --> 32:34.520
Oops.

32:34.553 --> 32:36.022
Next thing
you break,

32:36.055 --> 32:37.789
I'm-a clean up this floor
with your ass.

32:37.823 --> 32:41.160
You knew that I wanted that job,
Lucious.

32:41.193 --> 32:43.129
Okay, I will talk to Shine,
okay?

32:43.162 --> 32:45.464
Why should I trust you?
Ah...

32:45.497 --> 32:47.166
All right, that's your ass.

32:47.199 --> 32:49.468
Will you talk to Shine, Lucious?

32:50.536 --> 32:54.673
Because I am so tired

32:54.706 --> 32:56.975
of saving your ass.

32:57.009 --> 32:58.710
*

32:58.744 --> 33:02.348
When are you going to save mine,
Lucious?

33:02.381 --> 33:04.283
Look,

33:04.316 --> 33:07.319
that is a Jack Kennedy decanter.

33:07.353 --> 33:08.820
Put it down,
please.

33:08.854 --> 33:10.122
Please don't break it.

33:10.156 --> 33:12.224
Just place it
back on the table.

33:12.258 --> 33:15.027
No!

33:15.061 --> 33:17.496
Okay. Okay, that-that's
a gift from a diva.

33:17.529 --> 33:18.730
Put it down.

33:18.764 --> 33:20.166
What are you gonna give me,
Lucious?

33:20.199 --> 33:22.234
Look, I'll give you
whatever you want.

33:22.268 --> 33:23.835
Whatever.

33:23.869 --> 33:25.337
Whatever I want?

33:25.371 --> 33:26.705
Promise?

33:26.738 --> 33:29.408
Will you promise
you'll get me what I want?

33:29.441 --> 33:31.443
(muffled):
Anything.

33:33.045 --> 33:35.681
I want it in writing.

33:35.714 --> 33:37.816
Okay, whatever.
Whatever you need.

33:37.849 --> 33:40.352
In... writing.

33:40.386 --> 33:43.255
Done.

33:43.289 --> 33:45.691
Ah...

33:45.724 --> 33:46.858
I like you like this.

33:46.892 --> 33:48.727
Whatever you want.

33:48.760 --> 33:49.995
(grunts softly)

33:50.028 --> 33:51.997
Oh, you want to be in charge.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.166
Mm-hmm.
I remember this.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.434
(giggles)
Beautiful.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.506
LUCIOUS (whispering):
I like that.

34:00.539 --> 34:01.740
I like sliding down

34:01.773 --> 34:03.742
nice and soft.

34:03.775 --> 34:05.744
I know what you like, doll.

34:05.777 --> 34:07.379
(Anika shrieks)

34:10.116 --> 34:12.084
(Lucious exhales heavily)

34:12.118 --> 34:15.554
Yeah...
(exhales)

34:15.587 --> 34:17.556
Ah...
(grunts)

34:21.893 --> 34:23.529
LEAH:
Stop it!

34:23.562 --> 34:25.597
Sodom and Gomorrah!

34:25.631 --> 34:27.166
Stop it right now!

34:29.801 --> 34:32.638
Y'all humpin' on the table
like yard dogs!

34:32.671 --> 34:34.373
That's where I eat!

34:34.406 --> 34:36.308
(Anika snorts, both laugh)

34:36.342 --> 34:37.776
I was just about
to have a snack.

34:37.809 --> 34:39.311
(laughs)

34:40.346 --> 34:43.415
Don't you go nowhere.

34:43.449 --> 34:45.451
(exhales, chuckles)

34:45.484 --> 34:46.718
(groans)

34:46.752 --> 34:47.986
Mama?

34:50.122 --> 34:52.158
I want to talk to you

34:52.191 --> 34:54.092
about this doctor place
you been at.

34:58.130 --> 34:59.331
Come on.

34:59.365 --> 35:01.099
Meet me in the study.

35:01.133 --> 35:03.135
*

35:21.453 --> 35:25.090
I did just like you
told me to, Dwight.

35:25.123 --> 35:27.159
(exhales)
And I got Tariq

35:27.193 --> 35:29.161
to buy me three
ice cream cones.

35:29.195 --> 35:30.429
Sucker.

35:30.462 --> 35:33.131
(chuckles)

35:33.165 --> 35:35.967
That little performance
of yours over at Archibald?

35:36.001 --> 35:38.170
That was genius.

35:38.204 --> 35:39.471
(laughs)

35:39.505 --> 35:41.273
Lola Falana in Lady Cocoa

35:41.307 --> 35:42.841
ain't got nothing on me.

35:42.874 --> 35:44.376
(chuckles)

35:44.410 --> 35:46.044
So tell me, Mama,

35:46.077 --> 35:49.848
did he ask any questions
about me?

35:49.881 --> 35:51.350
Of course he did.

35:51.383 --> 35:53.685
But I just told him
what we planned.

35:53.719 --> 35:55.487
And I got him
talking

35:55.521 --> 35:57.022
about the old days instead.

35:57.055 --> 36:00.326
That was really,
really smart, Ma.
Mm.

36:00.359 --> 36:03.629
Did he tell you why he...

36:03.662 --> 36:06.064
hates me so much?

36:06.097 --> 36:07.866
It's all 'cause of Joe.

36:09.067 --> 36:10.736
My father?

36:10.769 --> 36:12.638
It was his father, too,
you know.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.640
And he didn't
never get

36:14.673 --> 36:17.042
a chance to meet him but once.

36:17.075 --> 36:20.679
And Fatima, she didn't give him
any keepsakes.

36:21.847 --> 36:24.850
Who in the hell is Fatima?

36:24.883 --> 36:27.018
His mama.
That whore that tried

36:27.052 --> 36:28.954
to steal your father from me.

36:30.222 --> 36:32.524
Poor Tariq.

36:32.558 --> 36:35.361
He's jealous of everything
you got.

36:35.394 --> 36:38.530
Especially your memories
of your daddy.

36:41.567 --> 36:42.768
(chuckles)

36:42.801 --> 36:44.503
(inhales)

36:44.536 --> 36:47.072
Did I ever tell you

36:47.105 --> 36:50.208
how much I love your crazy ass,
Mama?

37:06.091 --> 37:09.227
*

37:09.261 --> 37:12.063
Lucious is gonna be here
any minute.

37:12.097 --> 37:13.865
I thought you had something
you wanted to say to him.

37:13.899 --> 37:16.435
I do, but I want y'all
to hear this first.

37:16.468 --> 37:19.938
I realized what
my album is gonna be, so

37:19.971 --> 37:21.407
this is a song for Dad.

37:23.675 --> 37:25.243
*

37:25.277 --> 37:28.447
* Look at all
the hurt and pain *

37:28.480 --> 37:30.949
* That you caused
(elevator bell dings)

37:30.982 --> 37:34.286
* You chose to divide
our family *

37:34.320 --> 37:36.388
* For the fame at any cost

37:36.422 --> 37:39.625
* Be a man and accept

37:39.658 --> 37:43.829
* That this is all your fault

37:43.862 --> 37:46.097
* Yes, it is, I know it is

37:46.131 --> 37:48.500
* You made the good

37:48.534 --> 37:50.636
* Turn into bad

37:50.669 --> 37:53.905
* You failed us so much that

37:53.939 --> 37:55.974
* It's hard to call you Dad

37:56.007 --> 38:00.612
* You're something like
the worst nightmare *

38:00.646 --> 38:04.383
* I've ever had

38:06.051 --> 38:09.621
* Tell me how could

38:09.655 --> 38:13.359
* You be so heartless

38:13.392 --> 38:14.626
* Heartless *

38:14.660 --> 38:15.927
* And selfish

38:15.961 --> 38:17.996
* Selfish *

38:18.029 --> 38:19.965
* Own up to your
responsibility *

38:19.998 --> 38:21.867
* Or if not just let us free

38:21.900 --> 38:25.971
* It hurts like hell
that you can't see *

38:26.004 --> 38:28.707
* That you're a cold, cold man

38:28.740 --> 38:30.141
He's so, so cold.

38:30.175 --> 38:33.479
You left the love of your life

38:33.512 --> 38:35.881
locked down in a cell,
all because

38:35.914 --> 38:38.717
you wasn't man enough
to say you did it.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.852
Hmm.

38:40.886 --> 38:43.889
See, I don't even understand how
you could live with yourself.

38:43.922 --> 38:45.457
But it's all right, though.

38:45.491 --> 38:48.026
* Your judgment's coming

38:48.059 --> 38:50.028
* It's long past due

38:50.061 --> 38:53.064
* If you live by the sword

38:53.098 --> 38:55.501
* You die by it, too

38:55.534 --> 38:58.036
* You lied on your mother

38:58.069 --> 39:00.739
* About being alive

39:00.772 --> 39:03.341
* Just so your fame

39:03.375 --> 39:05.377
* And street cred won't die

39:05.411 --> 39:08.814
* Tell me how could

39:08.847 --> 39:12.418
* You be so heartless

39:12.451 --> 39:13.719
* Heartless *

39:13.752 --> 39:15.220
* And selfish

39:15.253 --> 39:16.488
* Selfish *

39:16.522 --> 39:18.557
* Own up to your
responsibility *

39:18.590 --> 39:21.059
* Or if not just let us free

39:21.092 --> 39:25.664
* It hurts like hell
that you can't see *

39:25.697 --> 39:28.467
* You're a cold, cold man.

39:32.704 --> 39:34.706
(track shuts off)

39:38.944 --> 39:41.613
Is this your idea
of a sick joke?

39:41.647 --> 39:44.015
(inhales shakily)
Nah, I mean...

39:44.049 --> 39:45.851
you seemed kind of jealous
of the song I wrote for Mom,

39:45.884 --> 39:47.118
so I wrote one for you.

39:49.555 --> 39:51.122
Did you know about this?

39:52.491 --> 39:54.259
You can't release that song,
Jamal.

39:54.292 --> 39:56.828
Not releasing anything
until my album is complete.

39:58.564 --> 40:01.567
It's gonna be called
When Cookie Met Lucious.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.401
Everything about the family:

40:03.435 --> 40:05.637
the good, the bad and all
the damage done in between.

40:08.607 --> 40:10.642
How... you met Mom,

40:10.676 --> 40:12.911
you... took her away from
her sisters and her father--

40:12.944 --> 40:14.179
basically killed him.

40:15.781 --> 40:16.882
What are you talking about?

40:16.915 --> 40:18.750
Stop it, Jamal, please.

40:18.784 --> 40:20.118
HAKEEM:
Nah, Mom.

40:20.151 --> 40:21.119
He deserves to know.

40:21.152 --> 40:22.488
(Cookie exhales)

40:22.521 --> 40:24.890
It's-it's not that simple.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.825
It's not

40:26.858 --> 40:28.259
black and white.

40:28.293 --> 40:29.495
(exhales)

40:29.528 --> 40:30.762
My father had

40:30.796 --> 40:31.997
a heart attack.

40:32.030 --> 40:33.765
And your Aunt Carol
and Candace

40:33.799 --> 40:35.567
blames Lucious.

40:35.601 --> 40:37.002
JAMAL:
Mom, I'm sorry,

40:37.035 --> 40:38.570
but your father,
our grandfather, died because

40:38.604 --> 40:40.672
he was protecting his...
COOKIE:
I did that.

40:40.706 --> 40:42.508
You don't know what
you're talking about.

40:44.810 --> 40:47.145
I broke my daddy's heart.

40:47.178 --> 40:50.148
And I never got a chance
to say good-bye.

40:50.181 --> 40:52.117
I had nothing to do

40:52.150 --> 40:53.685
with her father dying.

40:53.719 --> 40:55.787
He died because of stress.

40:55.821 --> 40:57.756
But...

40:57.789 --> 40:59.157
if he was still alive

40:59.190 --> 41:01.126
when I got
locked up,

41:01.159 --> 41:02.794
that would've killed him
for sure.

41:02.828 --> 41:04.162
ANDRE:
What's the point
of all this, Jamal?

41:04.195 --> 41:05.597
What good is this gonna do now?

41:05.631 --> 41:07.032
Truth and
reconciliation, brother.

41:07.065 --> 41:08.767
Why don't you look
at your mother?

41:08.800 --> 41:11.136
I know I can't be the only
one that wants to heal,

41:11.169 --> 41:12.638
and our father, he
owes that to us.

41:12.671 --> 41:14.806
Owe you?

41:14.840 --> 41:16.508
I gave you life.

41:16.542 --> 41:19.611
Everything that y'all have,

41:19.645 --> 41:21.212
it's because of me.

41:21.246 --> 41:22.914
Including this big-ass bullet
in my gut.

41:28.554 --> 41:30.522
Well, I can't change the past.

41:30.556 --> 41:31.723
You could change
the future, Dad.

41:31.757 --> 41:32.991
If you really wanted to,
you could.

41:33.024 --> 41:34.325
Look, you know, we-we do.

41:34.359 --> 41:35.894
We bitch and complain
all the time.

41:35.927 --> 41:38.564
And we should absolutely
be grateful

41:38.597 --> 41:40.065
for everything
that you've done for us.

41:40.098 --> 41:41.967
You're damn right you should be.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.869
Well, I am. I swear.

41:46.037 --> 41:49.575
But we're drowning here, man.

41:49.608 --> 41:51.577
And if you ain't gonna lead us
to some other place,

41:51.610 --> 41:53.745
other than heartache, then we're
gonna have to leave you behind.

41:53.779 --> 41:55.346
Jamal, Jamal,
that's enough, okay?

41:55.380 --> 41:57.182
That's enough.
LUCIOUS:
"We"?

41:57.215 --> 41:59.618
Are y'all all in cahoots
with him?

42:07.025 --> 42:09.595
Oh, and now y'all ain't
got nothing to say?

42:09.628 --> 42:11.462
Nothing?

42:15.901 --> 42:17.836
LUCIOUS:
You are some piece of work, man.

42:17.869 --> 42:19.771
You standing there

42:19.805 --> 42:22.774
breathing because I'm willing
to do the dirty work

42:22.808 --> 42:26.578
necessary to keep
this family safe.

42:26.612 --> 42:29.715
When your mama
called in a hit...
Lucious.

42:29.748 --> 42:31.282
...to clean up a mess...
Lucious!

42:31.316 --> 42:33.418
...she had made...
Mom, what is he talking about?

42:33.451 --> 42:34.953
...with Freda's father...
Shut up.

42:34.986 --> 42:36.387
...who do you think
answered that call?

42:38.724 --> 42:40.592
No, that's not true.
Ma, that's not true.

42:40.626 --> 42:41.927
That's...

42:45.430 --> 42:47.565
Ah...

42:47.599 --> 42:49.100
LUCIOUS:
I'll tell you one thing

42:49.134 --> 42:50.902
your mama's right about:

42:50.936 --> 42:53.104
everything ain't
black and white.

42:53.138 --> 42:55.273
And we ain't all

42:55.306 --> 42:56.642
good and bad.

42:56.675 --> 42:58.143
But I will
be damned

42:58.176 --> 43:01.947
if I will ever apologize
for loving you.

43:59.805 --> 44:00.772
Yeah.
