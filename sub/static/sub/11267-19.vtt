"The Heart Will Go On"
Closed Captioned

00:01.960 --> 00:03.170
Previously on 90210:

00:03.295 --> 00:05.005
We were only together
because of my cancer,

00:05.130 --> 00:07.299
and it's gone.

00:07.424 --> 00:10.177
So, I think that me and you
need to live our own lives.

00:10.302 --> 00:12.179
You did not tell me

00:12.304 --> 00:13.096
your mystery man was PJ.

00:13.221 --> 00:14.932
How do you know him?

00:15.056 --> 00:16.433
I know him because he's mine.

00:16.558 --> 00:17.601
You can have Preston.

00:17.726 --> 00:19.687
You deserve him
far more than I do.

00:19.812 --> 00:20.479
What's that?

00:20.604 --> 00:22.314
Uh, it's from Jen.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.023
She's following PJ.

00:24.149 --> 00:25.359
She lied to me.

00:25.484 --> 00:27.987
I might have a cancer gene.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.905
Let me take the test.

00:30.030 --> 00:30.948
Would you go with me?

00:31.072 --> 00:33.283
When I look at you, I think
about more than just the moment.

00:33.408 --> 00:35.285
I think about the future.

00:35.410 --> 00:35.995
Can I call you my girlfriend?

00:36.119 --> 00:38.706
Yes, please.

00:38.831 --> 00:40.081
MAN:
We want to sign you

00:40.207 --> 00:41.667
to a record contract.

00:41.792 --> 00:42.626
I can't wait to tell Ade.

00:42.751 --> 00:43.961
It's not for her.

00:44.085 --> 00:46.547
It's for you alone.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.595
(phone rings)
DIXON: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.096
Okay, here you
go, thanks.

00:55.222 --> 00:56.724
This is Dixon.

00:56.849 --> 01:00.101
Guess what I'm listen to
right now and loving?

01:00.227 --> 01:02.604
Dixon Wilson's solo track
and our next hit.

01:02.730 --> 01:03.814
Just need to sign a deal

01:03.939 --> 01:05.272
and get you into the
recording studio, buddy.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.860
Yeah, you know I-I-I'm really
glad that you like it,

01:07.985 --> 01:10.905
but I haven't decided
on whether I'm moving forward

01:11.030 --> 01:12.823
without Adrianna or not.

01:12.948 --> 01:14.157
Well, you're definitely not
moving forward with her.

01:14.282 --> 01:17.160
Dixon, life's too short.

01:17.285 --> 01:18.871
We're interested now.
We might not be later.

01:18.996 --> 01:22.123
(hangs up)

01:22.249 --> 01:23.500
Here.

01:23.625 --> 01:26.253
Low-fat, decaf,
and something with fiber.

01:26.378 --> 01:28.296
Ah, huh...

01:28.422 --> 01:31.383
Annie, uh, you know
how much I love

01:31.508 --> 01:32.760
these brother-sister
breakfastses

01:32.885 --> 01:33.761
that we have once a week,

01:33.886 --> 01:35.846
but you really got to stop
worrying about me

01:35.971 --> 01:37.848
and my digestive system.

01:37.973 --> 01:40.308
Fine, we can talk
about something else.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.852
Using drugs again?

01:41.977 --> 01:43.395
Are you serious right now?

01:43.520 --> 01:44.772
I heard you on the phone.

01:44.897 --> 01:46.189
You're starting
to run yourself ragged

01:46.314 --> 01:47.566
with the music thing again,
and that's exactly how

01:47.691 --> 01:49.401
your drug problem started
to begin with.

01:49.526 --> 01:52.195
That phone call wasn't
about the music business.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.072
Really?

01:55.115 --> 01:58.368
Okay, look, that producer
that was at the music festival

01:58.493 --> 02:00.120
wants to sign me to
a recording contract...

02:00.245 --> 02:01.413
(gasps)

02:01.538 --> 02:02.915
...without Ade.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.041
Oh.

02:04.165 --> 02:05.709
So, what'd you say?

02:05.834 --> 02:08.044
Well, I just sent them some solo
tracks to keep them interested.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.670
How did Adrianna
feel about that?

02:09.797 --> 02:11.298
I haven't told her yet.

02:12.591 --> 02:13.508
What?
What am I supposed to say?

02:13.634 --> 02:15.302
"Babe, they want me
and not you."

02:15.427 --> 02:16.762
That's like telling her,
I'm a rising star

02:16.887 --> 02:19.139
and she's just the crazy baggage
holding me back.

02:19.264 --> 02:23.978
Dixon, Ade is not gonna be upset
if you just tell her the truth;

02:24.103 --> 02:25.520
that you think
the recording company is wrong,

02:25.646 --> 02:27.064
so you're not going
to take the deal.

02:27.188 --> 02:30.191
Yeah, yeah, I should do that.

02:30.317 --> 02:32.903
Hello. I hate to intrude

02:33.028 --> 02:34.822
on your little
brother-sister breakfast,

02:34.947 --> 02:38.075
only because I find the concept
nauseatingly Midwestern,

02:38.199 --> 02:39.827
but I just had
to show you something:

02:39.952 --> 02:41.411
A tiny CU sweater.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.705
Oh! Oh, my goodness.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.040
Chuck's going to look
so adorable in that.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.708
So, I guess you and Jen
made up, huh?

02:46.834 --> 02:48.002
Who?

02:48.127 --> 02:49.795
Jen, your sister?

02:49.920 --> 02:51.379
Oh! (chuckles)

02:51.505 --> 02:52.965
No.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.591
I don't have a sister.
Jen's dead to me.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.551
And when she gets back
from Napa and sees this,

02:56.677 --> 02:57.594
her Ivy League head will explode

02:57.719 --> 02:59.680
and I'll ship her remains
back to Paris

02:59.805 --> 03:01.473
and never speak to her again.

03:01.598 --> 03:02.599
Enjoy your breakfast.

03:05.268 --> 03:08.605
The study of
form and function.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.108
You would seriously go
to college for that?

03:11.232 --> 03:13.819
Damn, white people
got money to burn.

03:13.944 --> 03:16.530
Okay, okay, okay,
or maybe I could go work

03:16.655 --> 03:18.740
for that environmental group,
Surf for Good.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.199
They loved the logo
I did for Annie

03:20.325 --> 03:21.160
and they invited me
on some sailing trip

03:21.284 --> 03:23.620
as a surfer activist.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.747
They called your art a "logo."

03:25.873 --> 03:27.248
Nuh-uh. Pass.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.250
Look, I made something
that people are responding to.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.628
Okay, Diego? I'm not just
going to lay around here

03:31.753 --> 03:32.921
and not take advantage of it.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.798
I happen to like you
laying around here.

03:34.923 --> 03:38.259
Maybe that's because
you make it look fantastic.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.887
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding?

03:40.012 --> 03:42.181
Diego, you are so
friggin' talented.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.557
You've got to do
something with this.

03:43.682 --> 03:45.976
All I got to do is my art
and hang out with you.

03:46.101 --> 03:46.226
Is there anything

03:46.351 --> 03:48.269
in that pile of fan mail

03:48.395 --> 03:49.563
that's going
to make that happen?

03:54.068 --> 03:55.485
Spoke too soon.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.487
This is big.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.406
The Downtown Artist-
in-Residence Program.

03:59.531 --> 04:01.575
This is what
you should be doing.

04:01.700 --> 04:02.868
It's a really cool group,

04:02.993 --> 04:05.537
and you'd get a workspace
just down the street from here.

04:05.662 --> 04:08.289
It's the next best thing
to, uh, moving in with me.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.958
And who said I was trying
to move in with you?

04:10.084 --> 04:11.043
Well, you haven't heard
the benefits yet.
Mm-hmm.

04:11.168 --> 04:13.128
We can paint,

04:13.253 --> 04:16.173
and kiss, and paint.

04:16.297 --> 04:18.132
Let me help you visualize.

04:22.679 --> 04:25.140
(giggling)

04:34.108 --> 04:35.943
DIRECTOR:
Cut!

04:36.068 --> 04:37.277
Turning around.

04:37.402 --> 04:39.362
MAN: Check the gate.
MAN 2: Second team in.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.573
That was a
convincingly passionate

04:41.698 --> 04:42.407
human-to-alien lip-lock.

04:42.532 --> 04:45.202
(scoffs) Yeah, well,
it wasn't easy.

04:45.326 --> 04:46.995
Apparently they don't believe
in breath mints on her planet.

04:47.121 --> 04:52.542
(chuckles) Well, good news is,
uh, you're off tomorrow.

04:52.667 --> 04:55.629
So, um, I booked
an appointment

04:55.754 --> 04:58.799
for the ecancer gene test
tomorrow at 2:00.

04:58.924 --> 05:00.508
Okay.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.761
But if you can't go,
if you're busy...

05:02.886 --> 05:04.138
Silver, I'll be there.

05:04.263 --> 05:07.099
(sighs)
Thanks.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.645
Thanks for keeping it
just between us.

05:11.770 --> 05:15.816
Um, till I know more,
I'm not ready to talk about it.

05:15.941 --> 05:19.569
Hey... not talking is
pretty much my specialty.

05:26.910 --> 05:30.164
What does a girl have to do to
get a call sheet around here?

05:30.289 --> 05:32.332
(chuckles)
Got'em.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.458
Thank you.
There you go.

05:33.583 --> 05:34.668
(chuckles)

05:34.793 --> 05:39.131
Wow. That Silver--
she is an eager beaver.

05:39.256 --> 05:40.007
Yeah, yeah.
(chuckles)

05:40.132 --> 05:41.382
(chuckles)
Yeah.

05:41.508 --> 05:44.011
Is that lipstick
on your mouth?

05:44.136 --> 05:46.138
Oh, (scoffs), making out
with an alien.

05:46.263 --> 05:49.224
Oh. Well, in that case.

05:49.348 --> 05:50.600
Um, I'd say you deserve this.

05:50.725 --> 05:53.520
$50,000.

05:53.645 --> 05:56.815
That is a signing bonus
plus initial compensation

05:56.940 --> 05:58.775
equals reason to celebrate.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.527
(both chuckle)

06:00.652 --> 06:04.072
I say we take a nice drive
up the coast,

06:04.198 --> 06:06.491
maybe check in
to a seaside inn and...

06:06.616 --> 06:08.493
Okay.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.078
...roll around naked
in your new money.

06:10.204 --> 06:11.830
Oh, man, you have
the best ideas.

06:11.955 --> 06:13.414
And you don't work tomorrow.

06:13.540 --> 06:18.253
Yeah, tomorrow, um, I've
actually got something at 2:00.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.048
There's nothing on
the call sheet.

06:21.173 --> 06:22.507
Publicity photos.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.718
That's what Silver
was just talking to me about.

06:24.843 --> 06:27.929
Well, if Silver says it,
it must be true.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.097
Yeah, yeah.

06:29.223 --> 06:31.474
Hey...

06:31.599 --> 06:32.267
we'll find time
to celebrate this.

06:32.391 --> 06:34.644
Mm.
Trust me, okay?

06:43.611 --> 06:44.905
Hey, look at this.
Oh, my God.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.656
I didn't make the call!

06:46.781 --> 06:49.993
LIAM: I'm blaming you.
I'm blaming you.
(Silver laughs)

06:55.707 --> 06:59.044
I'm home.

06:59.169 --> 07:03.757
Oh, I had the most
stomach-turning flight back from
Napa in coach.

07:03.882 --> 07:06.885
(sighs)

07:07.010 --> 07:09.637
Why are my bags
in the living room?

07:09.763 --> 07:10.389
I booked tickets
for you and Jacques

07:10.513 --> 07:11.890
to fly back to Paris tonight.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.517
Ugh, Naomi, if you're angry
because I outmaneuvered you

07:14.642 --> 07:16.895
in our contest for Preston
Hillingsbrook, don't be.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.646
I couldn't get near him
all weekend.

07:18.772 --> 07:22.359
His family has some sort of
impenetrable compound.

07:22.483 --> 07:23.735
I don't care about
penetrating PJ's compound.

07:23.860 --> 07:26.196
You lied to me, Jen.

07:26.321 --> 07:28.573
Naomi, all is fair
in love and war.
Not with family.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.992
You said being my sister
meant something to you.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.244
And do you know
what hurt me the most?

07:32.369 --> 07:33.328
I actually believed you.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.789
It was just another lie you used

07:35.914 --> 07:37.707
to get what you wanted.

07:37.832 --> 07:39.584
Like the time, for example,

07:39.709 --> 07:43.213
when you wrote me this postcard
from riding camp.

07:43.338 --> 07:45.090
You wanted my fur collar jacket

07:45.215 --> 07:48.718
because you wanted to have
something to remember me by!

07:48.843 --> 07:51.054
And this! This is the map
that you drew of our house.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.097
You said the bedroom
with the smallest closet

07:52.222 --> 07:54.057
had secret treasure!

07:54.182 --> 07:55.767
Oh, and this.

07:55.892 --> 07:58.478
This is a picture of us
at my fifth birthday party.

07:58.603 --> 08:01.815
You are wearing
my birthday dress

08:01.940 --> 08:05.402
because you told me
it made my butt look big!

08:05.526 --> 08:06.987
Naomi, stop, please, okay?

08:07.112 --> 08:09.072
I feel awful.

08:09.197 --> 08:12.409
Yeah? I am done feeling awful
because of you.

08:12.533 --> 08:14.619
No, I mean I feel
physically awful.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.288
(sighs) That flight
was like a petri dish.

08:16.413 --> 08:19.374
I think I'm gonna be sick.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.625
No, no, no.
This is the part

08:20.750 --> 08:22.585
where I kick your bony butt
to the curb!

08:22.710 --> 08:24.045
I already updated
my Facebook status.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.047
Believe me, after that little
hate speech of yours,

08:26.173 --> 08:27.299
I would love nothing more

08:27.424 --> 08:30.677
than to walk out of here
with my head held high.

08:30.802 --> 08:33.763
Wha...?
Okay, no. No, no, no.

08:33.888 --> 08:35.474
This doesn't change anything.

08:35.597 --> 08:36.890
I still want you
out of my house.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.518
And my life!

08:38.643 --> 08:40.645
Forever, Jen!

08:40.770 --> 08:43.523
And don't expect me
to hold your hair!

08:47.319 --> 08:49.570
♪ ♪

09:04.085 --> 09:06.421
According to the doctor,
Jen can't fly for 48 hours

09:06.546 --> 09:08.465
because she has a stomach virus.

09:08.589 --> 09:11.843
I just think she's allergic
to being an evil bitch.

09:11.968 --> 09:14.762
Look, maybe this is your chance
to make up with her.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.223
Okay, sometimes when
you have to be there

09:16.348 --> 09:17.516
for somebody who's sick,
it makes you both realize

09:17.640 --> 09:19.851
how much you care
about each other.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.102
And sometimes that
person gets well,

09:21.228 --> 09:22.437
and serves you
with divorce papers,

09:22.562 --> 09:23.730
which I think you
should sign immediately

09:23.855 --> 09:25.065
and move on with your life.

09:25.190 --> 09:26.483
I will, okay?

09:26.607 --> 09:28.276
Put the past mistakes
behind you.

09:28.402 --> 09:29.861
That's what I'm doing.

09:29.986 --> 09:32.364
The second Jen isn't patient
zero, she is out of here.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.324
Until then,

09:34.449 --> 09:36.535
I think a breakfast
of day-old lo mein

09:36.659 --> 09:37.327
should settle her stomach.

09:37.452 --> 09:39.913
Oh, my God, that's so nasty.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.667
ANNIE:
Well, thanks to Desert Valley,
our bag sales

09:44.792 --> 09:47.045
should hit maybe $20,000
by the first quarter,

09:47.170 --> 09:49.756
so we really need
to pick a charity to fund.

09:49.881 --> 09:51.425
This one sounds interesting.

09:51.550 --> 09:53.218
It provides services
to needy...

09:53.343 --> 09:54.928
strippers.

09:55.053 --> 09:58.139
'Cause you know those poles
they dance on can get so cold.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.558
Tragic.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.268
Can you pay attention
for two minutes?

10:01.393 --> 10:02.310
Not when I'm being ignored.

10:02.436 --> 10:03.437
I've been here an hour.

10:03.562 --> 10:04.812
No one's done a cartwheel
in a bikini yet.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.647
(scoffs)
Not gonna be me.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.525
Okay, sorry to burst
your little bubble,

10:08.649 --> 10:11.152
but your flirting three-way
with Naomi and Jen is over.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.946
Now, maybe you can
apply yourself

10:13.071 --> 10:14.072
to something that's
actually important.

10:14.197 --> 10:16.116
Do you want me
to pick a charity?
Yeah.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.700
Fine.
Ivy, pick a charity.

10:17.825 --> 10:20.078
Um, how about Surf for Good?

10:20.203 --> 10:21.413
They're sponsoring
a beach cleanup today.

10:21.538 --> 10:22.497
Perfect. We're in.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.540
Cool.

10:23.664 --> 10:25.083
You're going to
clean up the beach?

10:25.208 --> 10:26.293
Oh, no, no, no, no.

10:26.418 --> 10:27.877
I'm going to have drinks
at the beach.

10:28.002 --> 10:29.003
You're going to the beach
and getting a life.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.005
I have a life.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.048
Being a buzzkill?

10:32.173 --> 10:33.174
You don't go out on any dates.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.801
You don't have any fun.

10:34.926 --> 10:35.843
You're always on my back
because I do.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.096
Now you're going to go to
that beach, get some action,

10:38.221 --> 10:40.307
and maybe some guy will find

10:40.432 --> 10:42.183
your compulsive do-gooding
attractive,

10:42.309 --> 10:44.769
perhaps even a rugged, tan
homeless man.

10:44.894 --> 10:47.481
I am not using a charity event
to pick up some guy.

10:47.606 --> 10:49.441
Well, I'm not signing
a check till you do.

10:49.566 --> 10:52.611
Consider it my donation

10:52.735 --> 10:54.404
to the Get Annie Wilson Laid
Foundation.

10:54.529 --> 10:56.072
All right.

10:58.241 --> 10:59.659
(phone rings)

11:02.537 --> 11:03.704
(chuckles wryly)
It's Vanessa.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.374
She wants to know how
the photo session's going.

11:06.500 --> 11:10.044
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have asked you to be here.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.963
I can do this by myself.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.423
I mean, they're
just gonna ask questions

11:13.548 --> 11:15.342
and take blood.
Yeah, and tell you

11:15.467 --> 11:16.968
if you're gonna get cancer.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.928
(knocking)

11:19.053 --> 11:20.514
Erin Silver?

11:20.639 --> 11:22.974
Yeah. Uh, I mean,
it's not me; it's her.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.934
I'm with her.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.187
That's okay.
It's important to have support.

11:27.312 --> 11:29.730
If you test positive
for the BRCA gene,

11:29.856 --> 11:31.525
you're gonna be facing
some tough choices.

11:31.650 --> 11:34.611
Some people don't
even want to know.

11:34.735 --> 11:37.780
Yeah, I...
I didn't know if I did,

11:37.905 --> 11:41.535
but I watched my mom die
of breast cancer, so...

11:41.660 --> 11:43.537
if knowing means that
won't happen to me...

11:43.662 --> 11:44.912
DOCTOR:
If you have

11:45.038 --> 11:47.499
the BRCA gene, there are
things that can be done.

11:47.624 --> 11:49.917
A preventative double mastectomy
can reduce your risk

11:50.043 --> 11:53.547
of breast cancer from 90%
in your lifetime to almost none.

11:53.672 --> 11:57.050
However, the gene also increases
your risk of ovarian cancer.

11:57.175 --> 12:01.221
At some point you'll
also have to consider
removing your ovaries.

12:01.346 --> 12:03.515
Have you two talked about
a plan for having children?

12:03.640 --> 12:06.100
No, he's-he's not, um...
We're not...

12:06.226 --> 12:08.144
I don't have a boyfriend.

12:08.269 --> 12:10.063
Or a plan for kids.

12:10.188 --> 12:14.025
I kind of just thought
I would meet somebody
and fall in love.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.861
Well, that could still
be the plan. Right?

12:16.986 --> 12:18.279
Fertility is something
that we can discuss

12:18.405 --> 12:20.865
when the test
results come in.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.618
(laughs softly)
You may not even
have the gene.

12:25.495 --> 12:28.623
ANNIE:
Why does every guy

12:28.747 --> 12:31.042
think that the answer
to a girl's problems

12:31.167 --> 12:32.793
is to get a guy?

12:32.919 --> 12:35.380
Because they're guys?
Exactly.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.173
Look, forget
PJ Moneybags.

12:37.298 --> 12:38.925
Coming from somebody
who is not a guy,

12:39.050 --> 12:41.636
it kind of does seem like you've
lost all interest in dating.

12:41.760 --> 12:45.181
I'm just trying to do
something positive

12:45.306 --> 12:46.933
with my life,
no big mystery there.

12:47.058 --> 12:49.894
Uh, unlike why you haven't
signed your divorce papers yet.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.896
I... know.

12:52.021 --> 12:54.399
It's not like I didn't know
the divorce was coming.

12:54.524 --> 12:56.775
It's just... God, signing
the papers, you know?

12:56.901 --> 12:58.403
It feels like this whole
marriage never even happened.

12:58.528 --> 13:00.071
Ivy, your marriage
happened.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.615
I was there.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.575
I even have a photo
of the elephant.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.826
Look, my-my life is exactly
as it was before I met Raj.

13:05.952 --> 13:08.663
You know? I have this
huge, huge year ahead of me,

13:08.787 --> 13:11.207
and on the other hand, there's
this amazing guy I really want

13:11.332 --> 13:13.209
to be with, but I feel
like I can't have both

13:13.334 --> 13:15.044
of those things.
Why not?

13:15.169 --> 13:17.046
Well, Diego's pushing me to do
the Artist-in-Residence thing

13:17.171 --> 13:18.632
I was telling you about,
which looks cool,

13:18.757 --> 13:19.924
and we could be together,

13:20.049 --> 13:21.760
but, you know,
what I really want to do

13:21.884 --> 13:22.927
is go on that Surf for Good
sailing trip,

13:23.052 --> 13:25.096
in which case we would be apart.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.974
Well, you've got to
follow your dreams,
right? Not his.
Last time

13:28.099 --> 13:29.267
I tried that,
my husband left me.

13:29.392 --> 13:31.018
So I don't want to make
that mistake again.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.771
Diego is not Raj,
and you're not the same person

13:32.895 --> 13:35.148
you were a year ago, either;
none of us are.

13:35.273 --> 13:37.484
So whatever you decide,
you're not gonna make
the same mistakes.

13:37.609 --> 13:40.111
So you just get
to make new ones.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.154
Excuse me, uh...

13:41.279 --> 13:43.114
Annie Wilson, right?

13:43.239 --> 13:45.199
Please tell me a guy
in very expensive loafers

13:45.325 --> 13:46.867
did not pay you to talk to me.

13:46.993 --> 13:50.371
Uh, no. You started the bag
sales for charity, right?

13:50.497 --> 13:51.122
It's very cool.

13:51.247 --> 13:51.956
Thanks.
(laughs)

13:52.081 --> 13:53.667
I'm Caleb.

13:53.792 --> 13:55.710
I helped organize the cleanup.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.295
Also very cool.
I'd love to hear more

13:57.420 --> 13:58.879
about how your foundation works.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.381
Any chance I could buy you
a cup of coffee,

14:00.507 --> 14:01.882
bore you with some questions?

14:02.008 --> 14:04.218
Assuming that the coffee
is not in those disposable cups

14:04.344 --> 14:05.720
that we throw into the ocean.
I bet

14:05.844 --> 14:06.638
she would love that.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.474
Consider that my donation
to Shut Up PJ.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.936
Consider it a date.

14:14.061 --> 14:15.522
Great.

14:17.898 --> 14:20.527
DIXON: Hey.
I'm Dixon Wilson.
Hey.

14:20.652 --> 14:22.612
Uh, I've got an urgent text
to come down here.

14:22.737 --> 14:24.405
Is Carter from House
of K Records here?

14:24.531 --> 14:27.033
No. But, uh,
your girlfriend is.

14:27.158 --> 14:28.743
(laughs)

14:28.868 --> 14:29.952
Hi.

14:30.077 --> 14:31.705
Hey, babe! Um...

14:31.830 --> 14:33.080
Hey.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.123
Mwah.
Mwah.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.834
Wh-What are you
doing here?

14:35.958 --> 14:37.752
Well, you've just been
so stressed out since
the music festival,

14:37.877 --> 14:39.253
so I wanted to
make it up to you.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.631
I got us studio
time. (laughs)
Yeah.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.007
Who else would send you
a text saying:

14:43.132 --> 14:44.175
"I want to make music together"?

14:44.300 --> 14:45.009
Nobody.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.511
(both laugh)

14:46.636 --> 14:48.012
But you should've
just talked to me.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.389
Yeah, well,
I would have,

14:49.514 --> 14:51.432
but you haven't really
been talking to me.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.685
Look, I know
that that was

14:53.810 --> 14:55.562
a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity,

14:55.687 --> 14:57.522
and I blew it... okay?

14:57.647 --> 15:00.358
But maybe if you let me
call the record company
and explain myself...

15:00.483 --> 15:02.861
I already told you:
there's-there's no point.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.446
Okay. Well, then let's cut a
demo and make a new opportunity,

15:05.572 --> 15:06.823
okay?
Yeah.

15:06.947 --> 15:07.948
(laughs)

15:08.074 --> 15:09.909
Hey, can you play back
that track?

15:11.994 --> 15:13.954
(mid-tempo intro playing)

15:14.080 --> 15:15.540
Where'd you get that?

15:15.665 --> 15:17.124
Your computer.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.669
We can't use that.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.379
Why not?

15:21.504 --> 15:22.922
Because it's mine.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.507
I mean, b-because
it's not ready.

15:24.632 --> 15:25.966
Yeah, well,
it sounds ready to me.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.428
And since when do you start
working on music without me?

15:28.553 --> 15:29.721
Since I had to do it

15:29.846 --> 15:31.180
at Desert Valley.
Okay, Dixon,

15:31.305 --> 15:32.724
I don't know how many other ways

15:32.849 --> 15:34.183
I can apologize.

15:34.308 --> 15:35.976
♪ ♪

15:36.102 --> 15:37.478
What's wrong?

15:37.604 --> 15:39.105
I can't breathe.

15:39.230 --> 15:41.900
O-Okay, sit down.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.944
Put your head between your knees
or something, okay?

15:45.069 --> 15:47.280
Just breathe.
My chest hurts.

15:47.405 --> 15:48.907
It's gonna be okay.

15:49.031 --> 15:51.158
Call 911!

15:51.284 --> 15:53.494
You're gonna be okay.
Just breathe, okay?

15:53.620 --> 15:56.038
I-I think I'm having
a heart attack.

15:56.163 --> 15:56.873
You're gonna be okay.

15:56.997 --> 15:59.793
(gasping)

16:03.003 --> 16:05.131
Doc, I really don't know
what happened.

16:05.256 --> 16:08.635
I don't know.
My chest just tightened up.

16:08.760 --> 16:09.594
We had a fight.

16:09.719 --> 16:11.846
Could that give someone
a heart attack?

16:11.971 --> 16:15.057
The blood test showed
no sign of cardiac damage.

16:15.182 --> 16:16.810
Then what was it?

16:16.935 --> 16:18.728
Were you recently prescribed
any medication,

16:18.853 --> 16:20.605
anything with a
stimulant effect?

16:20.730 --> 16:23.775
W-Well, I was addicted
to ADHD medication,

16:23.900 --> 16:25.610
but I'm clean now-- swear.

16:25.735 --> 16:28.488
Yeah. He went to rehab
a couple of months ago.
I'll order you

16:28.613 --> 16:29.739
an ECG and an ultrasound,

16:29.864 --> 16:31.825
but I suspect you have
an atrial septal defect.

16:31.950 --> 16:33.743
Okay. Wh-What's that?
A heart defect.

16:33.868 --> 16:36.078
Something you were born with.
Your drug use

16:36.203 --> 16:37.997
compounded the problem by
damaging your heart's ability

16:38.122 --> 16:40.291
to contract,
causing an arrhythmia.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.627
Whatever stress you were under
caused you to throw a clot.

16:42.752 --> 16:45.212
Your condition is
treatable, but for now

16:45.338 --> 16:46.881
just avoid any stress that
increases your heart rate.

16:51.636 --> 16:52.887
(exhales)
I'm sorry, Ade.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.388
No, don't, okay?

16:54.514 --> 16:56.683
This is... my fault.

16:57.558 --> 17:00.478
I'm just so happy
to still have you.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.440
ANNIE:
So, you actually

17:04.565 --> 17:06.317
saw a mermaid.

17:06.442 --> 17:07.694
Okay, it was a fish,

17:07.819 --> 17:10.613
caught in a wig,
but I'm telling you,
(laughs)

17:10.738 --> 17:12.490
beach cleanup is
full of excitement.

17:12.615 --> 17:13.574
Clearly.
Here you go.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.784
Thank you.

17:14.909 --> 17:15.868
No, no.

17:15.993 --> 17:17.161
Allow me.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.704
It's enough you're
saving the world.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.039
I'm just doing my part.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.374
Why?

17:21.499 --> 17:23.376
Don't get me wrong:
I think it's great,

17:23.501 --> 17:24.961
but most people
don't even bother,

17:25.085 --> 17:26.503
so why do you?

17:26.628 --> 17:29.256
Probably the same reasons
you do.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.300
I doubt that.

17:31.425 --> 17:33.720
I lost someone
very close to me,

17:33.845 --> 17:36.639
and there was nothing
I could do about it.

17:36.764 --> 17:40.018
Made a promise:
anytime I can do something,

17:40.142 --> 17:40.894
I will.

17:41.019 --> 17:43.730
Um...

17:43.855 --> 17:47.400
well, I had a really bad year,

17:47.525 --> 17:50.862
and I did...
some really bad things.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.447
(sighs) But I
can't undo them,

17:53.573 --> 17:56.701
so I just thought that
maybe by doing good things,

17:56.826 --> 17:59.161
it would help me move on.

17:59.286 --> 18:01.581
I'm sorry; I don't
really talk about this,

18:01.706 --> 18:03.123
not even with my friends.

18:03.249 --> 18:04.625

Here, lunch.

18:10.048 --> 18:12.091
Is it a dead rat?

18:12.216 --> 18:13.843
I saw that in an old movie.

18:13.968 --> 18:16.554
The crazy younger sister
tortures the beautiful invalid

18:16.679 --> 18:18.056
until she dies.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.140
I'll make sure
to put that in my queue.

18:20.266 --> 18:23.185

18:23.310 --> 18:25.479

You know, I want to...

18:25.605 --> 18:28.733
I want to be here even less
than you want me here.

18:28.858 --> 18:31.945
So now hating each other
is a competition, and Jen wins?

18:32.070 --> 18:33.571
What a surprise.
You know,

18:33.696 --> 18:36.156
you have an amazingly selective
memory when it comes to me.

18:36.282 --> 18:37.867
I want you
to take a look

18:37.992 --> 18:39.911
at this birthday photo,
and you tell me

18:40.036 --> 18:42.747
that you wouldn't have looked
awful in that dress.

18:42.872 --> 18:44.206
If you don't stop talking

18:44.331 --> 18:46.084
and put that thermometer
into your mouth,

18:46.208 --> 18:48.252
I will find another place
to stick it.

18:48.377 --> 18:49.169
I tricked you
into taking

18:49.295 --> 18:50.421
that little bedroom.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.214
You know what the treasure was?

18:52.339 --> 18:53.716
It was the only room
in the house

18:53.841 --> 18:55.760
where you couldn't hear
Mom and Dad fighting.

18:55.885 --> 18:57.845
Is that true?

18:57.971 --> 19:00.765
Between the marble floors
and vaulted ceilings,

19:00.890 --> 19:03.517
we lived in an echo chamber
of marital discord.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.227
Who else do you think

19:05.352 --> 19:06.980
was gonna spare you from that?

19:07.105 --> 19:10.149
Annie needs me to help her
with the charity event.

19:10.274 --> 19:12.234
Well, don't stay
on my account.

19:12.359 --> 19:15.195
I could get more compassionate
care in a prison infirmary.

19:15.321 --> 19:18.365
Fine. I'll hire a nurse

19:18.491 --> 19:21.327
who specializes in treating
severe cases of bitch.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.003
Well, that
wasn't so hard.

19:30.128 --> 19:31.921
I'm sorry I dragged you
into this.

19:32.046 --> 19:34.214

share that with someone.

20:29.937 --> 20:31.230
No.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.899
I have a minor
heart defect.

Yeah.

You know, uh...

want Vanessa to find out

he could have another one.

PRESTON:
And that is why we
are both very proud

27:26.103 --> 27:28.314
to give our foundation's first
donation to Surf for Good...

27:28.439 --> 27:30.524
Dixon, I can't
believe this.

27:30.648 --> 27:33.319
Annie, it's totally treatable,
okay? I'm gonna be fine.

27:33.444 --> 27:35.112
Besides, I didn't tell you
because I didn't want you

27:35.237 --> 27:37.364
to stop your life and
start taking care of me.

27:37.490 --> 27:39.408
I was protecting you.
By lying?

27:39.533 --> 27:40.493
Dixon, you were using drugs.

27:40.618 --> 27:43.245
I didn't know,
so I wasn't there.

27:43.370 --> 27:45.747
Do you have any idea
what that did to me?

27:45.872 --> 27:47.625
If something were
to happen to you again,

27:47.749 --> 27:50.628
and I couldn't be there...
how do you think I'd feel?

27:50.752 --> 27:52.463
You'd feel awful
for the rest of your life.

CALEB:
Artist, surfer
and activist,

27:55.215 --> 27:56.550
Ivy Sullivan.

27:56.674 --> 27:57.843
(cheering and applause)

27:57.968 --> 27:59.052
Thank you.

27:59.178 --> 28:02.389
Okay, guys, I know today is
about what each of us can give,

28:02.515 --> 28:03.974
but I got to say right now,

28:04.099 --> 28:05.809
I feel like I'm the one
who's getting everything

28:05.934 --> 28:07.311
that I've ever dreamt of,
so thank you

28:07.436 --> 28:09.313
so much for being here
and for supporting our work.

28:09.438 --> 28:12.566
WOMAN:
Yeah! Good job, Ivy!

28:12.690 --> 28:14.026
Dude, I got to tell Ivy.

28:14.151 --> 28:16.820
You're gonna tell her now?

28:16.945 --> 28:20.491
I wish I had my camera,
but then again,

28:20.616 --> 28:22.409
I don't really need a picture
of this

28:22.535 --> 28:25.037
because I'll remember this day
for the rest of my life.

28:25.162 --> 28:26.288
What is wrong
with you guys?

28:26.413 --> 28:28.374
MAN:
Thank you guys all...

28:28.499 --> 28:30.000
Um...

28:30.125 --> 28:31.960
(laughs)

28:32.085 --> 28:34.547
I-I saw Raj.

28:34.672 --> 28:36.256
What?

28:36.382 --> 28:37.883
At the hospital.

28:38.008 --> 28:40.219
Yeah. Dixon,
he moved to Baltimore

28:40.344 --> 28:41.928
after he broke up with me.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.096
I don't know
what you're talking about.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.349
DIXON:
He lied.

28:45.474 --> 28:47.643
The cancer didn't go away,
and he didn't want to tell you.

28:53.773 --> 28:55.817
Ivy, Raj is dying.

29:11.667 --> 29:13.586
Hi. Could we get some help
here, please?

29:13.711 --> 29:15.170
Um, I'm looking for Raj.
Raj Kher.

29:15.295 --> 29:17.423
Yeah. Uh, he came
into the ER last night.

29:17.548 --> 29:20.634
He's in room 109, but there are
no visitors allowed.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.969
Just family.
She's his wife.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.889
Follow the hallway
through the double doors.

29:46.493 --> 29:48.954
I'm gonna kill Dixon.

29:49.079 --> 29:51.498
How could you lie to me?

29:51.624 --> 29:54.167
How could you lie to me, Raj?

29:55.544 --> 29:57.379
Ivy, I don't need you here.

29:57.504 --> 30:00.173
I didn't want you to see this.

30:00.299 --> 30:03.469
Oh, my God, please,
please don't do that, okay?

30:03.594 --> 30:06.972
Please do not pretend
that you were protecting me

30:07.097 --> 30:09.141
because when you left,
Raj, I cried.

30:09.266 --> 30:10.934
I cried anyway,

30:11.059 --> 30:13.186
and it wasn't because
you were sick, all right?

30:13.312 --> 30:15.188
It was because...

30:15.314 --> 30:16.856
because you broke my heart...

30:19.109 --> 30:20.611
...and I didn't think
that you loved me.

30:22.195 --> 30:23.781
(sniffles)

30:23.905 --> 30:26.158
A breakup isn't as bad
as watching me die.

30:26.283 --> 30:29.411
You know what? Nothing is as bad
as not being here.

30:30.454 --> 30:32.706
Okay, nothing.
Damn it, Raj!

30:32.831 --> 30:34.667
(sighs)

30:34.792 --> 30:37.586
What do you think
was gonna happen?

30:37.711 --> 30:40.422
Did you think
I was gonna get over you

30:40.547 --> 30:41.465
and-and be happy one day?

30:41.590 --> 30:43.967
And then the minute
I actually started

30:44.092 --> 30:46.261
living my life, then
that would be the perfect time

30:46.386 --> 30:48.764
to find out
that you had lied to me?

30:48.888 --> 30:51.057
And that you died
here alone?

30:51.183 --> 30:52.892
I mean, how can you be
so selfish?!

30:53.018 --> 30:53.977

Stop.

I told my sister
she was dead to me

without even think about what
those words actually meant.

33:33.261 --> 33:34.888
It's not your fault.

33:35.013 --> 33:35.973
I wanted to blame Jen

33:36.097 --> 33:38.391
my whole life.

33:40.268 --> 33:43.062
Mostly because she was
a royal pain in the ass,

33:43.188 --> 33:45.273
but I guess in
some warped way,

33:45.398 --> 33:46.775
she was there for me.

33:46.900 --> 33:50.153
She's... my pain in the ass.

Jen, I'm...

39:48.178 --> 39:50.596

40:11.284 --> 40:13.494
Glad to hear
you two made up.
