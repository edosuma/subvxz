Gohan desperately endures
Piccolo 's style of arduous training.

00:11.762 --> 00:13.923
Tenshinhan and the others
had finished their training

00:14.014 --> 00:16.972
in the Heavenly Realm, and had all
descended back to the lower realm,

00:17.059 --> 00:20.347
each to prepare for the
conflict in their own way.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.475
And as for Goku,

00:23.565 --> 00:26.728
he was learning the Kaio-ken
technique directly from Kaio

00:26.819 --> 00:29.686
at a surprisingly fast rate.

00:31.865 --> 00:35.403
Two days remain until the Saiyans arrive!

00:35.494 --> 00:38.577
What will the outcome of their training be?

This will be your final day of training with me.

02:32.069 --> 02:34.560
Your punning studies may
have come up a little short,

02:34.655 --> 02:37.943
but for the most part,
I've taught you what I know.

02:39.368 --> 02:43.532
Let's review what you've learned up to now.

02:43.622 --> 02:45.487
Mm-hmm.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.664
First up is Bubbles.

02:58.679 --> 02:59.634
Ready”.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.177
Start!

03:03.016 --> 03:07.009
Oh! 0.8 seconds! That's a new record!

03:10.941 --> 03:13.148
Next, Gregory.

03:13.235 --> 03:14.691
Right.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.116
Ready... Start!

03:27.207 --> 03:31.246
Okay... here goes!

03:35.507 --> 03:37.839
Huh? Ow!

03:37.926 --> 03:40.338
1.2 seconds.

03:40.429 --> 03:42.044
Unbelievable!

03:42.139 --> 03:43.549
Okay, next?

03:43.640 --> 03:47.303
All right, finally, let's check your Genki Dama.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.385
I've been waiting for this.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.989
All right, ready, Kaio-sama.

04:47.788 --> 04:51.531
Mm-hmm. Okay, here we go.

04:55.045 --> 04:59.038
See if you can track the
super speed of this giant brick.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.668
Mm-hmm!

05:00.759 --> 05:03.171
Here goes!

05:19.736 --> 05:23.570
Okay, super speed!

05:54.896 --> 05:57.638
Like it was nothing...

05:57.733 --> 06:01.521
Well done, Son Goku. I honestly
didn't think you would be able

06:01.611 --> 06:04.569
to handle the Genki Dama this well.

06:04.656 --> 06:06.112
I worked hard on it.

06:06.199 --> 06:10.158
Mm-hmm. It may sound like
I keep repeating myself,

06:10.245 --> 06:12.702
but the Genki Dama is a technique

06:12.789 --> 06:15.701
that lets you take a small sliver of energy

06:15.792 --> 06:19.159
from the grass, the trees, people, animals,

06:19.254 --> 06:23.418
and every other conceivable thing,
including the air itself,

06:23.508 --> 06:26.921
gather it together, and then release it.

06:27.012 --> 06:30.300
Mm-hmm. It really is an awesome technique.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.800
Even on a planet as small as this,

06:31.892 --> 06:35.726
the Genki Dama had that
much destructive force.

06:35.812 --> 06:43.059
Earth, where you'll be fighting,
is much larger, compared to here.

06:43.153 --> 06:48.238
Also, you'll have the tremendous
energy of the Sun on your side.

06:48.325 --> 06:51.067
Your Genki Dama will have astounding power.

06:51.161 --> 06:52.446
If you're not careful,

06:52.537 --> 06:55.995
you could even destroy the very
planet you're trying to protect.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.783
If you can help it, don't use it.

06:59.878 --> 07:02.164
If, and only if there's nothing else you can do,

07:02.255 --> 07:05.042
I give you permission to
use it just once. Got it?

07:05.133 --> 07:06.714
Mm-hmm, got it.

07:06.802 --> 07:09.965
I'm sure I'll be able to manage
with just the Kaio-ken.

07:10.055 --> 07:13.843
Okay then, the day of your
battle is almost upon us.

07:13.934 --> 07:17.097
The Saiyans will arrive on Earth tomorrow.

07:19.481 --> 07:22.848
Huh?! O-Oh, no!

07:22.943 --> 07:25.400
W-What? What's the matter?

07:25.487 --> 07:29.355
Uh, listen, I didn't calculate
the time it will take you to travel

07:29.449 --> 07:31.690
the Serpentine Road to get back!

07:31.785 --> 07:34.777
K-Kaio-sama, ain't you capable of

07:34.871 --> 07:37.613
whooshing me back to the lower realm?!

07:37.707 --> 07:39.789
No, uh, I can't.

07:39.876 --> 07:42.913
l-l've got to go back down that road?!

07:43.004 --> 07:45.256
It took me over half a year to get here!

07:45.340 --> 07:48.457
A-As you are now, you can
arrive there in two days.

07:48.552 --> 07:52.261
I'll tell Earth's Kami to pick you up there.

07:52.347 --> 07:56.215
B-But I'll still be one day over!
Everyone will be killed!

07:56.309 --> 08:01.599
Stop your griping! Even I make
mistakes once in a while!

08:03.024 --> 08:05.891
Now, hurry up and tell your friends on Earth

08:05.986 --> 08:09.604
to use their Dragon Balls or
whatever to bring you back to life!

08:09.698 --> 08:13.190
T-Tell them? But how?

08:13.285 --> 08:17.574
Place your hand on my back,
and speak in your mind.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.325
It will get through that way.

08:19.416 --> 08:20.952
ReaHy?

08:22.252 --> 08:22.832
Like this?

08:22.878 --> 08:25.415
Mm-hmm, like that. Hurry and tell them!

08:27.299 --> 08:34.842
O-Old Timer, it's Goku. Can you
hear my voice? Hey, Old Timer!

08:40.979 --> 08:43.436
Man, this girl is downright...

08:45.775 --> 08:50.644
G-Goku? Is that you, Goku?
W-Where are you?! Where are you?!

08:50.739 --> 08:57.030
He hears me! Old Man Turtle Hermit,
I'm still in the Next World.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.452
I'm speaking to you through my mind

08:59.539 --> 09:01.530
from a faraway place called Kaio's World.

09:01.625 --> 09:03.707
T-The Next World?

09:03.793 --> 09:07.126
Have you gotten all of
the Dragon Balls together?

09:07.214 --> 09:10.126
Y-Yeah. We've long since gathered them.

09:10.217 --> 09:14.381
Everyone looked frantically for
them so we could rescue you.

09:14.471 --> 09:19.761
Thanks. So then, I hate to ask,
but could you summon Shen Long,

09:19.851 --> 09:22.809
and bring me back to life right now?

09:22.896 --> 09:25.979
The Saiyans will be getting to Earth tomorrow.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.102
W-What?!

09:28.193 --> 09:33.733
T-Tomorrow, already? That's a whole
month earlier than we thought!

09:33.823 --> 09:37.736
Hurry, Old Timer.
I'll be just a little bit late,

09:37.827 --> 09:41.240
but I'll definitely manage something.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.367
Hey, Goku...!

09:44.668 --> 09:47.751
Er, I can't breathe!

09:47.837 --> 09:49.418
Ah! Sorry!

09:49.506 --> 09:54.796
A-All right, got it. By the way,
Goku, what do you say?

09:54.886 --> 09:57.502
We'd heard that you were
training in the Next World.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.337
Any luck with that?

09:59.432 --> 10:02.219
Mm-hmm, you bet!

10:02.310 --> 10:06.644
H see. That's a relief.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.227
H-Hey, is he all right?

10:10.318 --> 10:14.436
Old Man Turtle Hermit is talking
to himself in the bathroom.

10:14.531 --> 10:16.647
I wonder if he's going dotty.

10:18.660 --> 10:22.699
Hey, get the Dragon Balls ready, right now!

10:31.381 --> 10:36.000
That was awesome, Kaio-sama!
I got right through to him!

10:36.094 --> 10:37.254
Naturally.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.176
I can finally come back to life!

10:39.264 --> 10:42.882
All right then, while we're waiting
for you to come back to life,

10:42.976 --> 10:46.764
let me do something about that
heavy, ragged outfit of yours.

10:46.855 --> 10:49.187
Eh? Really?

10:49.274 --> 10:50.810
Watch.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.525
Awesome! It's lighter!

10:58.616 --> 11:03.736
It's not just lighter. It's made out
of a wonderfully sturdy fabric.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.537
It can even repel minor attacks.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.489
Thank you, Kaio-sama!

11:08.585 --> 11:12.749
Wow, terrific! You left the
"Turtle" mark where it was!

11:12.839 --> 11:15.751
l was worried that if I had
clothes like yours, Kaio-sama,

11:15.842 --> 11:18.083
I wouldn't look very cool.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.419
Well, excuse me.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.129
Ah, I hope they bring me back to life soon!

11:26.102 --> 11:31.347
The mark on the back is the
snazziest point on it, huh?

11:31.441 --> 11:34.103
Hmm? Yeah!

11:53.046 --> 11:56.664
What's wrong? You can't defeat
the enemy by just dodging him!

12:04.682 --> 12:06.138
All right!

12:17.654 --> 12:22.148
Whoops, I got carried away.
Was that a bit too strong?

12:29.624 --> 12:33.037
That was no fair. You said you
weren't going to use your eyes.

12:33.128 --> 12:34.493
Don't be such a baby!

12:34.587 --> 12:37.579
Do you think a promise like that
means anything in a fight?!

12:37.674 --> 12:42.464
B-But Piccolo-san, you're not the enemy.

12:47.267 --> 12:50.179
Now, come forth, Shen Long!

13:19.966 --> 13:23.959
It's the middle of the day,
but it's suddenly dark out.

13:36.191 --> 13:38.102
E-Excuse me, here...

13:38.193 --> 13:40.479
Don't touch me!

13:40.570 --> 13:44.108
N-No matter how many times
| see it, it's still scary.

13:59.380 --> 14:05.421
Speak your wish. I shall grant any one wish.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.636
S-Say, um, I suppose we
couldn't say we wanted him

14:11.726 --> 14:16.937
to dispatch the Saiyans,
and save the Earth, could we?

14:17.023 --> 14:21.312
What are you talking about? Are you
thinking of keeping Son-kun dead?

14:21.402 --> 14:23.859
|-|t's not like that. It would be nice and easy

14:23.947 --> 14:27.531
to just have Goku brought back
to life the next time, right?

14:29.244 --> 14:34.489
That is an impossible wish.
I was created by Kami.

14:34.582 --> 14:39.702
As such, I cannot grant any
wish beyond Kami's power.

14:39.796 --> 14:43.835
Well then, please bring Son Goku back to life.

14:43.925 --> 14:48.089
That is an easy wish to grant.

15:08.157 --> 15:11.240
Son Goku is about to be resurrected, huh?

15:13.162 --> 15:18.452
Which means, the Saiyans will be
coming sooner than we thought!

15:21.379 --> 15:24.166
All right, the halo over
your head has disappeared.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.588
You have been brought back to life!

15:25.675 --> 15:27.916
Hooray!

15:29.262 --> 15:31.344
--Go on, hurry!
--Right!

15:31.431 --> 15:34.173
Remember, your enemies are evil men,

15:34.267 --> 15:36.007
more powerful than you can imagine!

15:36.102 --> 15:38.639
They won't let you drop
your guard for an instant!

15:38.730 --> 15:41.597
Don't go thinking you can be
brought back to life again!

15:41.691 --> 15:45.149
That's all right. The Dragon Balls
can only bring you back to life once.

15:45.236 --> 15:48.478
I'll give them everything
I've got! Just you watch!

15:48.573 --> 15:50.029
Mm-hmm.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.574
Thanks for everything, Kaio-sama!

15:53.661 --> 15:56.869
Once I die, I'll come see you again!

15:56.956 --> 15:58.537
Bubbles!

15:58.625 --> 16:00.536
--G regory!
--Ta ke ca re!

16:00.627 --> 16:02.163
Bye, now!

16:21.356 --> 16:23.312
Bye!

16:34.077 --> 16:37.569
What unfathomable strength that man has.

16:37.664 --> 16:41.282
And yet his heart is even clearer than crystal.

16:41.376 --> 16:45.415
To think that there would be
someone like him in the lower realm.

16:45.505 --> 16:48.121
Kaio-sama, he has become
even stronger than you, huh?

16:50.510 --> 16:54.173
Still, his sense of humor wasn't that great.

16:54.263 --> 16:58.097
The next time he comes here,
I'll train him on that.

17:00.436 --> 17:03.348
Oh, hush, you. Just hush.

17:07.652 --> 17:10.689
Wow, so light, so light!

17:10.780 --> 17:13.646
My body feels as light as a cotton ball!

17:16.368 --> 17:18.108
Oh, right!

17:19.747 --> 17:22.659
This ain't no time to be thrilled.
l have to hurry!

17:26.671 --> 17:32.507
And so, the next day at 11:43 AM...

17:38.141 --> 17:45.684
...Earth at last allows the two
Saiyans to trespass upon her.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.540
Papa, I'm hungry.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.966
Oh, is it already this late?

18:57.053 --> 18:59.009
W-What was that?

19:00.223 --> 19:02.305
What happened?

19:06.729 --> 19:09.345
T-This is stunning...

19:09.440 --> 19:11.931
It looks like something fell from the sky.

19:18.366 --> 19:22.575
S-Sure enough. That round
thing fell out of the sky.

19:26.332 --> 19:28.197
There's one over here, 1200.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.431
It's a person!

19:49.522 --> 19:52.434
A person came out of it!

19:53.442 --> 19:55.307
Over here, too!

19:55.403 --> 19:57.314
It's a person!

19:57.405 --> 19:59.361
W-What...?

20:15.506 --> 20:18.589
So, the Saiyans are finally here.

20:20.177 --> 20:23.510
They have an incredible Ki, huh, Piccolo-san?

20:29.604 --> 20:32.141
T-Ten-san...

20:32.231 --> 20:36.474
Tch, that was a lot sooner than we thought.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.981
It's just about time for the Saiyans to arrive.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.652
Hurry!

20:40.740 --> 20:43.482
Guys, hold out for me!

21:16.442 --> 21:21.232
The dreadful day has finally arrived.
