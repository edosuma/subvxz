A ten-year sentence for someone...

00:44.670 --> 00:47.890
who stabbed a woman 13 times is unprecedented.

00:49.759 --> 00:53.179
I've never had a client who stabbed me in the back like this.

00:56.850 --> 00:59.148
Once in the courtroom, you can't deviate from what was agreed upon.

00:59.149 --> 01:00.820
Don't you know how dangerous it is?

01:02.280 --> 01:05.029
Thanks to you, all my hard work went down the drain.

01:05.030 --> 01:07.409
Now, both the prosecution and the court will...

01:15.829 --> 01:17.540
What were you thinking?

01:20.379 --> 01:23.378
I'm sorry. But I was also...

01:23.379 --> 01:25.340
You've already lost everyone's trust.

01:26.930 --> 01:28.640
If the trial begins like this,

01:28.760 --> 01:30.640
what is the probability of you winning it?

01:30.930 --> 01:32.390
Ten or twenty percent at the most?

01:34.430 --> 01:37.439
I'm out. You can handle the rest.

Hey, you can't score an exclusive scoop...

02:02.540 --> 02:05.170
by doing things that everyone else does.

02:06.170 --> 02:08.219
Look for a different angle.

02:08.550 --> 02:10.638
An angle that others missed or cannot see.

02:10.639 --> 02:13.559
Being brave enough to say no when everyone else is saying yes.

02:13.560 --> 02:14.930
I sure know what that's like.

02:15.270 --> 02:18.348
But most of the people who do that lose their footing and fall.

Hey, what did I not do?

02:47.169 --> 02:49.799
Name one thing that I didn't do.

02:49.800 --> 02:53.139
I even went to the scene and took photos of...

02:55.389 --> 02:57.520

04:16.389 --> 04:18.759

24:58.130 --> 24:59.210
Yes.

25:04.509 --> 25:05.549
Here.

25:09.099 --> 25:14.809
(Kim Hyun Soo, Attorney Shin Joong Han)

25:22.240 --> 25:24.359
It'll be a jury trial.

25:26.109 --> 25:30.200
How long would I have to wait?

25:32.039 --> 25:35.750
About a month to two months at the most.

25:43.920 --> 25:45.049
Hyun Soo.

25:45.630 --> 25:47.890
I'll do my best.

25:48.470 --> 25:50.430
So don't give up, okay?

25:51.059 --> 25:52.769
This will be an excruciatingly long fight.

25:53.180 --> 25:55.599
Even if you only see a tiny shred of hope, hold on to it.

25:55.849 --> 25:57.309
And do not let it go.

25:57.980 --> 26:00.019
The moment you let it go, you're finished.

26:01.529 --> 26:02.609
Do you understand?

26:44.940 --> 26:46.569
Thanks to you, my kid can now...

26:46.990 --> 26:49.529
go to school without having to be afraid of those bullies.

26:50.200 --> 26:53.789
My gosh. How can I ever repay you?

26:54.329 --> 26:56.000
Come on. What are friends for?

26:56.750 --> 26:58.670
We help each other out, you know.

27:06.089 --> 27:08.130
(10 dollars)

27:11.890 --> 27:13.759
Hey, you didn't have to do this.

27:15.890 --> 27:17.480
Anyway, take it easy.

27:29.240 --> 27:30.859
His son...

27:31.569 --> 27:34.079
was having some problems at school,

27:34.200 --> 27:35.619
so I helped him out a little.

27:40.579 --> 27:42.829
But how? You're in here.

27:43.500 --> 27:45.880
Korea is a small country.

27:49.549 --> 27:51.379
My hands can reach every corner of the country.

27:51.380 --> 27:53.139
("What Makes a Leader")

27:53.140 --> 27:55.099
I'm not sure if you know this,

27:56.640 --> 27:58.679
but your sister has transferred to a different school...

27:58.680 --> 28:00.140
due to a bullying incident.

28:01.269 --> 28:03.900
Your father's taxi was confiscated by the National Forensic Service,

28:05.859 --> 28:07.690
so he's working as a deliveryman at the moment.

28:15.450 --> 28:16.990
How do you know all this?

28:17.789 --> 28:20.500
I didn't look into it to threaten you, so don't worry.

28:23.920 --> 28:25.339
Hyun Soo.

28:27.049 --> 28:28.839
I need your help with something.

28:33.339 --> 28:36.680
The jurors didn't study law,

28:36.849 --> 28:39.219
so things like precedents, legal logic, and principles...

28:39.220 --> 28:41.598
won't really help. They won't understand...

28:41.599 --> 28:42.849
or even be interested.

28:43.309 --> 28:46.309
Do you want to know what moves them? This.

28:46.819 --> 28:48.069
It's this.

28:48.819 --> 28:51.279
The heart? But you don't have one, do you?

28:51.529 --> 28:53.108
That's why I say we're lucky.

28:53.109 --> 28:54.779
I am heartless,

28:55.119 --> 28:56.450
but Hyun Soo isn't.

28:59.289 --> 29:00.999
(Name: Kim Hyun Soo)

29:01.000 --> 29:02.910
(Age 24, College Student)

29:02.960 --> 29:05.170
(The woman I used to love)

29:08.710 --> 29:10.460
Hello?

29:10.549 --> 29:11.799
Thanks for today.

29:12.380 --> 29:15.299
You helped me out, big-time.

29:15.589 --> 29:17.180
Come on. It was nothing.

29:18.140 --> 29:21.479
Right, honey. I have a favour to ask too.

29:21.480 --> 29:23.230
Can you please stop calling me like that?

29:27.900 --> 29:28.940
What is it?

29:52.710 --> 29:54.670
What's your win rate?

29:55.339 --> 29:57.839
How would I know? I have no idea.

29:59.140 --> 30:00.470
How could you not know?

30:01.390 --> 30:04.139
Why should I know? Not every lawyer keeps track of things like that.

30:04.140 --> 30:05.348
Although it's always nice to win.

30:05.349 --> 30:07.479
- I'm counting on you though. - What?

30:07.480 --> 30:08.859
- That's nonsense... - You have company.

30:10.190 --> 30:11.690
Hey, you're here.

30:14.900 --> 30:16.279
She's my ex-wife.

30:17.490 --> 30:18.490
I see.

30:19.240 --> 30:21.409
Hello. I'm Seo Soo Jin, a lawyer.

30:21.410 --> 30:23.949
Mr. Shin and I are working on this case together.

30:23.950 --> 30:25.119
I'm Hong Jung A.

30:25.369 --> 30:27.079
We met at the NFS.

30:31.460 --> 30:32.630
So where's the room?

30:33.339 --> 30:35.259
Right, the room. I'll go with you.

31:03.660 --> 31:04.740
Right.

31:18.089 --> 31:21.049
- I saw it. - What? I didn't see anything.

31:25.559 --> 31:28.390
- I mean, I read the article. - Right.

31:28.480 --> 31:30.059
Why are you working so hard these days?

31:30.519 --> 31:31.769
It's very unlike you.

31:32.150 --> 31:33.940
I know, right?

31:34.400 --> 31:35.440
Okay.

32:30.660 --> 32:32.039
Excuse me, do you mind?

32:33.579 --> 32:35.130
Oh, not at all.

32:45.009 --> 32:46.220
This is fancy.

32:46.970 --> 32:49.470
A full-size Italian sofa.

32:50.680 --> 32:52.690
This would cost over 80,000 dollars.

32:53.519 --> 32:54.599
My gosh.

32:56.059 --> 32:57.980
Very nice.

33:14.369 --> 33:15.500
This is a painkiller.

33:19.549 --> 33:21.049
Why do I need a painkiller?

33:23.430 --> 33:24.679
The right arm would be better.

33:24.680 --> 33:26.599
Wait, my arm? What for?

33:26.759 --> 33:28.390
I need you to run an errand for me.

33:28.509 --> 33:29.809
What kind of errand?

33:31.680 --> 33:32.849
Nothing hard.

33:33.980 --> 33:36.399
You'll go to the hospital for a dislocated shoulder...

33:36.400 --> 33:38.768
and get it treated. That's all.

33:38.769 --> 33:39.900
No, wait.

33:40.109 --> 33:43.359
Let me... I'll find something else that you can use.

33:46.200 --> 33:47.369
Like what?

33:49.619 --> 33:52.119
What could you offer that I can't obtain myself?

33:54.660 --> 33:56.500
Favours go both ways.

33:57.670 --> 33:59.250
I helped you first, right?

34:01.799 --> 34:02.880
Don't be too worried.

34:03.470 --> 34:06.180
The doctor will easily pop your shoulder back in.

34:10.260 --> 34:12.639
Relax your arm. Otherwise, it'll break.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.159
(Kim Hyun Soo, Date of Birth: Aug 21, 1997)

34:37.960 --> 34:38.960
Lean back.

34:43.260 --> 34:44.260
Nothing hard.

34:45.469 --> 34:47.839
You'll go to the hospital for a dislocated shoulder...

34:47.840 --> 34:50.219
and get it treated. That's all.

34:50.679 --> 34:52.139
We're done. You can come out now.

34:57.269 --> 34:58.769
You won't need a cast,

34:59.559 --> 35:02.769
but a compression bandage and a sling will be required.

35:05.320 --> 35:08.908
I get that inmates want fresh air from time to time,

35:08.909 --> 35:11.159
but a habitual dislocation of the shoulder...

35:11.369 --> 35:12.909
will only make your life miserable.

35:13.869 --> 35:14.869
Right.

35:20.670 --> 35:22.039
- Is it the dislocated shoulder? - Yes.

35:25.880 --> 35:27.170
Please lower your arm.

35:27.590 --> 35:28.590
All right.

35:29.090 --> 35:30.969
Can you lend me a hand?

35:31.429 --> 35:32.550
Take deep breaths in and out.

35:33.099 --> 35:34.849
You'll feel some pain.

35:35.349 --> 35:37.429
Take deep breaths in and out. There you go.

35:38.019 --> 35:40.519
Keep it up. All right.

35:44.190 --> 35:45.360
Let's see.

35:46.190 --> 35:48.569
Try and rotate your arm. Does that feel better?

35:48.570 --> 35:51.069
Keep the right arm relaxed for a while.

35:51.070 --> 35:54.030
I'll wrap the compression bandage, and you'll be good to go.

36:01.500 --> 36:02.500
Shoes.

36:21.349 --> 36:22.349
Open your mouth.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.460
Why are you taking my compression bandage?

36:46.750 --> 36:47.750
Good job.

36:48.710 --> 36:49.800
You may leave.

37:06.519 --> 37:07.940
How's your shoulder?

37:10.690 --> 37:11.699
It's good.

37:13.820 --> 37:17.280
Mr. Jung, I have something to ask.

37:18.199 --> 37:19.539
About your errand?

37:22.369 --> 37:23.369
Yes.

37:25.250 --> 37:26.880
Don't bother to know.

37:28.380 --> 37:30.460
It's not like it'll change anything.

37:40.679 --> 37:43.389
Tomorrow's the first day of your trial, right?

37:44.230 --> 37:45.980
Just focus on that.

37:50.980 --> 37:51.989
Lights out!

40:02.820 --> 40:04.078
(Guk Hwa's house)

40:04.079 --> 40:08.289
Then tell me. Where did the girl want to go?

40:08.960 --> 40:10.460
The Han River.

(Hyun Soo's house, LPG, Guk Hwa's house)

41:10.679 --> 41:12.349
The way you're drinking indicates...

41:13.150 --> 41:14.480
that you have something to say.

41:15.730 --> 41:18.070
Hardly. That's not the case today.

41:18.820 --> 41:20.110
As if.

41:20.320 --> 41:23.949
Well, I was just hoping to go over the facts.

41:24.159 --> 41:25.659
I knew it.

41:32.619 --> 41:33.789
What's the issue?

41:34.539 --> 41:37.000
What must you go over and check...

41:37.130 --> 41:38.420
when it's a foolproof case?

41:41.800 --> 41:43.340
The case lacks just one thing.

41:50.769 --> 41:52.059
Direct evidence...

41:53.349 --> 41:54.599
that links him to the murder.

41:59.820 --> 42:01.650
I'd appreciate your help with that.

42:24.800 --> 42:25.800
Gosh.

42:28.010 --> 42:30.719
I think he's telling the truth about not remembering.

42:31.429 --> 42:32.559
(Multi-Drug Screen Test)

42:33.480 --> 42:35.598
His blood alcohol level was at 0.12 percent...

(Drug Analysis Report, Kim Hyun Soo)

42:38.400 --> 42:40.150
After taking this kind of cocktail,

42:40.690 --> 42:42.360
one wouldn't know even if his or her foot was cut off.

42:44.530 --> 42:46.739
Is there anything that could help me in court?

42:47.489 --> 42:50.739
Well, I guess you could argue with some of the collected evidence,

42:51.949 --> 42:53.369
but I'll need time.

42:54.539 --> 42:56.289
- I see. - So tell me.

42:56.829 --> 42:58.039
What motivated you?

42:59.750 --> 43:00.750
What do you mean?

43:01.039 --> 43:02.250
Kim Hyun Soo.

43:03.670 --> 43:05.840
What about him motivated you?

43:05.969 --> 43:08.429
Isn't it obvious? The money, of course.

43:14.389 --> 43:15.599
Wait, are you leaving?

43:16.769 --> 43:18.190
Of course.

43:20.230 --> 43:21.519
I thought we'd have a drink...

43:26.780 --> 43:28.610
since it's been a while.

43:34.409 --> 43:35.699
But I drove here.

44:18.409 --> 44:21.630

44:23.960 --> 44:26.710
From an evolutionary standpoint,

44:28.170 --> 44:30.429
what happened is quite natural.

44:32.300 --> 44:33.799
It's only temporary...

44:33.800 --> 44:36.429
due to the strong atopic medication.

44:37.219 --> 44:38.809
I switched to a new kind recently...

44:39.139 --> 44:41.309
after the doctor said I could lose my feet.

44:47.230 --> 44:49.570
You might not remember since it's been a while,

44:51.070 --> 44:52.570
but you know how I was.

44:56.409 --> 45:00.039
You know I used to be a beast in bed.

45:08.210 --> 45:10.050
You know Charles Darwin, right?

45:15.050 --> 45:16.139

Hey, Hyun Soo.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.619
What's with the shirt?

47:06.119 --> 47:07.170
Why?

47:08.420 --> 47:09.879
Take it off. Let's switch.

47:14.670 --> 47:16.089
Come on. Take it off.

No, lose the tie.

48:24.530 --> 48:28.579
about this woman's brutal death,

48:29.329 --> 48:32.710
to find out why and exactly how she died.

tried to destroy evidence immediately after the incident.

48:57.480 --> 49:00.070
Then he fled the scene in a stolen taxi.

49:01.320 --> 49:02.780
Under the influence of alcohol, of course.

49:06.409 --> 49:08.250
After committing such a horrible crime,

49:08.659 --> 49:11.789
Defendant Kim Hyun Soo denied having committed it altogether.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.289
He even refused to take a polygraph test.

49:14.460 --> 49:16.880
Even today in this courtroom,

49:17.380 --> 49:20.469
Mr. Kim will try to deny the brutal acts that he committed.

49:22.800 --> 49:23.929
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

49:24.719 --> 49:25.760
We must not...

49:26.139 --> 49:29.269
let that innocent face of his fool us.

49:29.980 --> 49:32.139
We must not disgrace the victim who died such a brutal death...

49:32.269 --> 49:34.149
or be tricked by the speculative questions...

49:34.150 --> 49:36.610
of the defence counsel, who claims that Mr. Kim is not guilty.

49:37.820 --> 49:40.940
Because this case...

49:42.530 --> 49:43.909
is not about how Ms. Hong Guk Hwa...

49:44.320 --> 49:45.949
lived her life.

49:46.659 --> 49:49.079
Rather, it is about how she died...

49:59.170 --> 50:02.170
and who...

50:02.800 --> 50:03.840
killed her.

50:06.550 --> 50:09.428
(Kim Hyun Soo)

50:09.429 --> 50:11.558
(Jury)

50:11.559 --> 50:12.638
(Defendant)

50:12.639 --> 50:13.809
I rest my case.

50:14.309 --> 50:15.400
Hyun Soo.

50:16.400 --> 50:19.859
Do not react to anything that happens in this courtroom.

50:19.860 --> 50:22.530
Don't move or talk.

50:24.699 --> 50:26.198
Don't even move your eyes.

50:26.199 --> 50:32.159
(Defendant)

50:39.590 --> 50:40.750
Well...

50:41.670 --> 50:45.130
Do you think the prosecution's claims are really true?

50:49.010 --> 50:51.099
Is there anything missing in the evidence...

50:51.519 --> 50:53.019
that the police have gathered?

50:59.480 --> 51:02.610
Mr. Kim is an ordinary young man in his 20s.

51:02.900 --> 51:04.949
Just like other young men that we see around us.

51:05.820 --> 51:08.110
He's just an ordinary average guy.

51:12.619 --> 51:14.000
He's a son,

51:17.539 --> 51:19.289
a brother,

51:22.250 --> 51:23.550
and a friend.

51:27.130 --> 51:29.888
Why did he stab a woman he met that day for the first time?

51:29.889 --> 51:32.929
He stabbed her 13 times.

51:34.019 --> 51:36.429
Why did he commit such a horrible act?

51:38.190 --> 51:39.900
Is this naive-looking guy...

51:40.230 --> 51:42.150
truly the killer,

51:42.769 --> 51:44.650
as the prosecution is insisting?

51:50.739 --> 51:53.158
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. As of this moment,

51:53.159 --> 51:55.159
you must throw away all your biases and preconceptions...

51:55.699 --> 51:58.289
and examine whether Mr. Kim is truly guilty...

51:58.420 --> 52:00.669
beyond a reasonable doubt as the prosecution is insisting.

52:00.670 --> 52:01.750
Why?

52:02.380 --> 52:03.920
Because we're not here...

52:04.250 --> 52:06.760
to prove Mr. Kim's innocence.

52:07.170 --> 52:09.679
We're here to examine whether Mr. Kim is guilty.

52:09.840 --> 52:11.598
And proving that he is guilty of the crime...

52:11.599 --> 52:12.929
isn't my job.

52:15.719 --> 52:17.429
That is the prosecution's job.

52:34.369 --> 52:37.159
Bloodflare detects bloodstains that aren't visible...

52:37.369 --> 52:38.619
to the naked eye.

52:39.619 --> 52:42.670
We have a photo of Mr. Kim taken on the day of the incident...

52:42.789 --> 52:44.500
with Bloodflare sprayed on him.

52:45.340 --> 52:47.670
(Defence)

52:48.050 --> 52:50.880
(Evidence Photo: With Bloodflare)

53:07.730 --> 53:09.280
You inspected the crime scene, didn't you?

53:09.820 --> 53:11.149
Yes, I did.

53:11.150 --> 53:14.030
The bloodstains found on Mr. Kim's body.

53:15.909 --> 53:17.289
Whose blood was it?

53:19.119 --> 53:22.079
The blood belonged to Hong Guk Hwa, the victim.

53:22.789 --> 53:25.000
Is there any chance that it could be someone else's blood?

53:25.340 --> 53:26.960
That is practically impossible.

53:29.590 --> 53:32.429
All right. Then what does this photo tell us?

53:33.300 --> 53:36.139
That he tampered with the scene and tried to destroy evidence.

53:36.760 --> 53:38.889
Is there evidence that Mr. Kim was the one...

53:39.719 --> 53:42.889
who tampered with the scene and attempted to destroy evidence?

53:42.980 --> 53:44.189
Yes, we're sure that it was him.

53:44.190 --> 53:47.149
He left other traces while trying to destroy evidence.

53:47.150 --> 53:49.189
His fingerprints and shoe prints, for example.

53:49.190 --> 53:51.570
(Crime Scene: Fingerprints Left During Attempt to Destroy Evidence)

53:53.110 --> 53:55.489
Don't you think he left too many traces at the scene...

53:55.989 --> 53:58.449
for someone who was attempting to destroy evidence?

53:59.539 --> 54:03.419
His prints, hairs, saliva, and DNA.

54:03.420 --> 54:04.709
(Witness)

54:04.710 --> 54:10.130
Do you think Mr. Kim deliberately approached the victim to kill her,

54:10.760 --> 54:12.419
then actively and intentionally...

54:12.420 --> 54:14.009
destroyed evidence at the scene?

54:14.010 --> 54:17.389
Or would it make more sense to see it as a careless mistake...

54:18.139 --> 54:21.219
made in panic mode after experiencing something unexpected?

54:31.150 --> 54:34.530
I'd say the latter is more likely.

54:34.909 --> 54:35.949
Right.

54:36.909 --> 54:38.829
If it were a premeditated murder,

54:39.530 --> 54:41.289
it wouldn't have been done this clumsily.

54:42.949 --> 54:44.039
I rest my case.

54:49.210 --> 54:52.259
What kind of knife was used to stab the victim?

54:52.260 --> 54:54.260
It was a non-serrated, single-edge knife.

54:54.380 --> 54:56.679
The length of the blade was about 15cm.

54:57.679 --> 54:59.260
For example...

55:00.510 --> 55:02.769
(Evidence 1)

55:03.679 --> 55:04.980
Something like this?

55:05.480 --> 55:06.559
Correct.

55:14.989 --> 55:16.030
Doctor.

55:17.070 --> 55:19.739
You have 20 years of experience as a forensic pathologist.

55:20.369 --> 55:23.698
Would you please share your opinion on this case?

55:23.699 --> 55:26.000
(Judge)

55:26.250 --> 55:28.880
Mr. Kim's skin cells were found under the victim's nails,

55:29.289 --> 55:31.960
and her blood was found on his body.

55:32.250 --> 55:34.510
Mr. Kim had the murder weapon on him,

55:34.630 --> 55:37.130
and the victim's blood and skin cells were found on it.

55:37.929 --> 55:39.509
Based on such solid evidence,

55:39.510 --> 55:42.099
I believe that Mr. Kim is the killer.

55:47.059 --> 55:49.559
However, the evidence you listed just now...

55:50.360 --> 55:53.018
cannot be considered direct evidence...

55:53.019 --> 55:55.110
to prove him guilty of Ms. Hong's murder.

55:55.739 --> 55:58.989
The wound on his palm can serve as direct evidence.

56:00.369 --> 56:03.409
"The wound on his palm."

56:07.000 --> 56:09.210
- This wound? - Correct.

56:09.329 --> 56:12.669
When he was stabbing her,

56:12.670 --> 56:14.589
the knife slipped out of his hand...

56:14.590 --> 56:16.590
because it got stuck in her spine. That's how he got the wound.

56:24.760 --> 56:27.230
How many stab wounds were found on the victim's body?

56:27.480 --> 56:28.729
There were 13.

56:28.730 --> 56:30.019
What could that mean?

56:30.940 --> 56:35.230
Well, some might say that it points to a crime of passion.

56:35.610 --> 56:37.189
So the killer had a grudge against her,

56:37.190 --> 56:39.359
or it was someone she knew.

56:39.360 --> 56:42.869
Defendant, did you know the victim prior to this event?

56:44.409 --> 56:45.409
No.

56:49.920 --> 56:50.920
The wound in that photo.

56:52.380 --> 56:54.169
Could it be explained otherwise?

56:54.170 --> 56:56.379
(Witness)

56:56.380 --> 56:58.300
No, that's the only explanation.

57:00.130 --> 57:01.130
Is that so?

57:02.179 --> 57:03.509
(Evidence Photo: Stab wound on defendant's hand)

57:03.510 --> 57:04.510
(Kim Hyun Soo's Drug Analysis Report)

57:04.849 --> 57:08.309
Doctor, can you elaborate on this drug analysis report?

57:08.980 --> 57:11.599
Various chemicals were detected in the test,

57:11.900 --> 57:14.980
but only three are relevant in forensic medicine.

57:15.360 --> 57:17.900
Alcohol, LSD, and ketamine.

57:18.110 --> 57:22.659
Out of those, LSD and ketamine are psycho pharmaceuticals...

57:23.110 --> 57:25.079
that are commonly known as narcotics.

57:25.329 --> 57:29.329
Then what would happen to an average man of 175cm and 70kg...

57:29.619 --> 57:32.288
if he consumed...

57:32.289 --> 57:34.539
a combination of those with alcohol?

57:36.840 --> 57:40.219
Psycho pharmaceuticals mixed with alcohol...

57:41.340 --> 57:44.760
can affect one's central nervous system...

57:44.849 --> 57:47.429
which could lead to severe memory loss.

57:48.679 --> 57:50.059
I see.

57:50.929 --> 57:52.309
Then...

57:53.690 --> 57:55.150
there's a good chance...

57:55.519 --> 57:57.769
that the defendant can't actually remember what happened.

57:58.320 --> 57:59.320
Right?

58:03.360 --> 58:07.119
Well, with the drugs that he consumed?

58:07.409 --> 58:08.989
Yes, one will say...

58:09.949 --> 58:12.328
that he was incapacitated.

58:12.329 --> 58:14.578
Incapacitated.

58:14.579 --> 58:16.669
"Incapacitated."

58:16.670 --> 58:17.670
So in other words,

58:18.460 --> 58:21.719
there is a medical reason behind the defendant...

58:23.050 --> 58:25.259
not remembering about that night.

58:25.260 --> 58:27.300
(Prosecution)

58:30.849 --> 58:34.349
I will only say that it's possible.

58:37.690 --> 58:38.820
That'll be all.

58:39.070 --> 58:40.779
(Jury)

58:40.780 --> 58:42.689
- What? - Incapacitated?

58:42.690 --> 58:45.409
- Could he not remember? - So it means...

58:52.619 --> 58:53.619
The evidence.

58:55.710 --> 58:57.960
The evidence obtained by the prosecution.

58:59.590 --> 59:02.259
There are 117 exhibits that point to the defendant...

59:02.260 --> 59:04.969
as the killer,

59:05.800 --> 59:08.388
but all he says is that he didn't kill her...

59:08.389 --> 59:09.679
and that he doesn't remember.

59:11.429 --> 59:14.139
That's the story he's sticking to.

59:15.809 --> 59:16.809
So how about this?

59:18.309 --> 59:20.150
Maybe returning to the crime scene...

59:21.360 --> 59:22.730
could trigger his memories.

59:26.530 --> 59:27.948
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

59:27.949 --> 59:29.829
(Defence)

59:31.159 --> 59:32.539
If you were to see...

59:33.579 --> 59:36.459
the crime scene with your own eyes,

59:36.460 --> 59:38.750
you would also realize...

59:39.380 --> 59:42.880
just how ridiculous his amnesia claim is.

59:46.550 --> 59:47.880
And right here is where...

59:48.510 --> 59:52.179
I officially request that you join me,

59:52.809 --> 59:57.309
the defendant, and his lawyers on a walk-through of the crime scene.

59:57.980 --> 59:58.980
- What? - Really?

59:59.190 --> 1:00:02.110
Prosecutor, please approach.

1:00:05.989 --> 1:00:07.199
Don't worry too much.

1:00:07.739 --> 1:00:08.739
Stay calm.

1:00:09.070 --> 1:00:10.569
(Judge)

1:00:10.570 --> 1:00:14.198
Prosecutor An, the media is all over this case as is.

1:00:14.199 --> 1:00:15.750
Must you let it get more attention?

1:00:17.579 --> 1:00:20.289
A walk-through of a crime scene in a trial by jury...

1:00:20.920 --> 1:00:23.670
can be requested by the prosecution and jury.

1:00:23.920 --> 1:00:25.420
How the jury decides is up to them.

1:00:25.590 --> 1:00:27.009
Unbelievable.

1:00:27.010 --> 1:00:30.428
(Judge)

1:00:30.429 --> 1:00:31.510
All right, fine.

1:00:35.769 --> 1:00:40.519
It seems like the jury must make an important decision.

1:00:41.650 --> 1:00:44.940
If you agree to a walk-through of the crime scene,

1:00:45.480 --> 1:00:47.239
please raise your hand.

1:00:57.699 --> 1:01:02.420
(Jury)

1:01:09.760 --> 1:01:11.719
Can't...

1:01:12.929 --> 1:01:14.389
Can't I stay back?

1:01:15.219 --> 1:01:16.969
I don't want to go to that house.

1:01:19.849 --> 1:01:22.479
This is a bridge you must cross anyway.

1:01:22.480 --> 1:01:23.690
If you refuse,

1:01:24.110 --> 1:01:25.979
the jury will see it as guilt.

1:01:25.980 --> 1:01:27.939
(Jury)

1:01:27.940 --> 1:01:30.820
Hyun Soo, consider us...

1:01:31.530 --> 1:01:33.949
on a moving train that can't be stopped.

1:01:34.619 --> 1:01:37.079
Stopping now equals death.

1:01:37.869 --> 1:01:39.159
We must see through this.

1:01:49.090 --> 1:01:50.469
We'll take a break of three hours...

1:01:51.130 --> 1:01:54.469
and reconvene starting with a walk-through of the crime scene.

1:01:55.010 --> 1:01:56.010
No...
