He called Tom just a few hours

How you doing?

05:39.081 --> 05:40.331

05:51.043 --> 05:53.511

You do, and you choose

06:09.803 --> 06:11.146

06:11.147 --> 06:12.062
Okay, enough.

06:12.064 --> 06:13.097
Just... I mean...
Enough.

06:13.148 --> 06:14.599
I'm going to do a dry run,

06:14.666 --> 06:16.734
map out the A.O.
and check for choke points.

06:16.802 --> 06:19.103

What are you saying?

06:19.154 --> 06:21.372
Excuse me, can you translate,
smooth dog?

06:21.440 --> 06:24.075
Huh?
A.O. is the area of operation,

06:24.126 --> 06:26.544
all the areas we need to
put on full lockdown--

06:26.612 --> 06:29.046
General Pak's route from the
airport to the Summit site.

06:29.114 --> 06:30.694
Choke points are areas
where the motorcade could

06:30.719 --> 06:32.180
get slowed or ambushed.

06:32.501 --> 06:33.668
Okay, okay, I got an idea.

06:33.752 --> 06:34.952
If you guys are gonna
keep talking like this,

06:35.020 --> 06:36.453
maybe we get a dictionary.

06:36.505 --> 06:37.505
All right, I'm sorry about him.

06:37.589 --> 06:38.556

- No.

06:44.630 --> 06:45.896
- It was jealousy.
- No!

06:45.964 --> 06:47.298
You don't like him, do you?

06:47.349 --> 06:48.516
What gave it away?

06:48.600 --> 06:49.850
You didn't like me at first
either.

06:49.935 --> 06:50.851
Let me explain something to you:

06:50.936 --> 06:52.270
I will never like
that cheeseball.

06:52.321 --> 06:54.939
Okay, I get that you were built
without a censor button,

06:55.007 --> 06:56.474
but if we have to go
to guns on this case,

06:56.541 --> 06:57.692
you're going to be happy
that he's on our side.

06:57.776 --> 07:00.494
Okay, if we have to go to guns
on this case,

07:00.579 --> 07:02.079
happy is not one of the emotions
I will be expressing,

07:02.147 --> 07:03.948
okay?

07:08.337 --> 07:09.453
Wow.

07:11.323 --> 07:12.623
Guy gets murdered

07:12.691 --> 07:15.259
right before he's about
to blow the top off of

07:15.327 --> 07:16.394
an assassination plot.

07:16.461 --> 07:17.795
Killer thinks that now

07:17.863 --> 07:19.063
nothing's standing
in his way.

07:19.131 --> 07:20.564
Yeah, except us.

07:20.632 --> 07:23.801
No foreign dignitary has ever
been killed on U.S. soil,

07:23.852 --> 07:26.170

to be the first.

07:35.445 --> 07:36.862
Okay, kid,

07:36.946 --> 07:38.480
walk me through it.

07:39.499 --> 07:41.616
Carotid was severed.

07:41.684 --> 07:43.218
Arterial spray on the wall.

07:43.286 --> 07:44.686
Good. What else?

07:49.058 --> 07:51.993
Okay, no forced entry.

07:52.044 --> 07:53.495
No signs of a struggle.

07:53.546 --> 07:55.130
By the looks of it,

07:55.198 --> 07:57.632
I'd say Agent Atwater
invited his killer in.

07:59.669 --> 08:01.736
Also got a shoe print.

08:01.804 --> 08:03.205
About a size six.

08:05.508 --> 08:06.475
Spiked heel.

08:06.542 --> 08:08.577
Looks like our killer
was female.

08:08.644 --> 08:10.078
<i>Maika'i loa,</i>

08:10.146 --> 08:11.746

08:11.814 --> 08:13.682

08:15.067 --> 08:17.018
Oh, look,
she bought him a drink.

08:17.069 --> 08:19.621
- You never had that happen?
- Once. Niagara Falls.

08:19.688 --> 08:21.907
Oh. Can you forward the tape,
please?

08:23.326 --> 08:25.026
Tell me something:
Why would a trained agent,

08:25.077 --> 08:26.661
even off-duty,
hook up with a random woman

08:26.712 --> 08:28.663
while he's on assignment?
I don't know.

08:28.731 --> 08:30.599
Lonely people do stupid things.

08:30.666 --> 08:32.100
Can you follow them?

08:34.169 --> 08:37.506
Here they are
in the elevator, and...

08:37.557 --> 08:39.808
here they are in the hallway.
Check it out. I mean,

08:39.875 --> 08:41.809
the camera never gets
a full shot of her face.

08:41.876 --> 08:43.211
She knows all the blind spots.

08:43.279 --> 08:45.313
Our girl did her homework.

08:45.381 --> 08:48.450
Wait a minute. Go back, go back.
Rewind the tape five seconds.

08:48.518 --> 08:50.051
And zoom in.

08:51.854 --> 08:53.355
Look at that--
his hand's shaking.

08:53.422 --> 08:54.689
Yeah, it's performance anxiety.

08:54.740 --> 08:55.774
Also Niagara Falls.

08:55.891 --> 08:58.793
Can you rewind the tape
back to the bar?

09:02.031 --> 09:03.198
Wait, wait, wait,
go back, go back, go back.

09:03.266 --> 09:04.633
Zoom in.

09:05.618 --> 09:07.169
Look at that.

09:07.236 --> 09:09.037
- She dropped something in his drink.
- That's a roofie.

09:09.105 --> 09:11.640
No, in small quantities,
GHB is an aphrodisiac.

09:11.707 --> 09:12.791
Huh. That would explain

09:12.875 --> 09:14.543
the animal kingdom behavior
in the hallway.

09:14.610 --> 09:16.545
Yeah, it would also explain
him skipping a meeting

09:16.596 --> 09:18.513
that he set about an impending
assassination attempt.

09:20.516 --> 09:23.635
<i>Here's a question: Anything</i>
<i>about this case bother you?</i>

09:23.719 --> 09:25.637
Everything about this case
bothers me.

09:25.721 --> 09:27.522
I mean, why not kill
the general in Sandimar?

09:27.590 --> 09:29.024
Well, if it was me,

09:29.091 --> 09:30.559
I'd want to hit the general
where his security detail

09:30.626 --> 09:32.049
is weakest,
and in Sandimar,

09:32.050 --> 09:33.210
he's surrounded by an army.

09:33.211 --> 09:35.129
I mean, the general
never leaves Sandimar,

09:35.197 --> 09:36.547
so if they don't get him here,
they don't get him.

09:36.632 --> 09:38.966
Which means we have to find
Atwater's killer

09:39.034 --> 09:40.935
before that happens.

09:42.819 --> 09:45.088
What is that?

09:45.155 --> 09:45.880
What's what?

09:45.881 --> 09:47.015
That.

09:47.066 --> 09:49.684
That is a picture of Grace.

09:49.735 --> 09:50.685
No, not that. That.

09:50.736 --> 09:53.438
Oh, that's a visual aid.

09:53.522 --> 09:55.190
Just a reminder
of a better place.

09:55.241 --> 09:56.624
- A visual aid?
- Yeah.

09:56.692 --> 09:58.360
Danny, this is a postcard
of New Jersey.

09:58.427 --> 10:00.176
I know exactly what it is;
I bought it, all right?

10:00.177 --> 10:01.840
What, you want to hear me say
it? I'm not afraid to say it.

10:01.841 --> 10:03.141
I miss home.
I'm a little homesick, okay?

10:03.192 --> 10:04.726
It's okay.
It's okay to be homesick.

10:04.810 --> 10:06.811
I miss Sal's Steak House. I miss
Frankie's. I miss Manny's.

10:06.862 --> 10:09.281
Do you realize how much of
your life revolves around food?

10:09.348 --> 10:10.982
Do you realize
how much your life

10:11.033 --> 10:12.233
revolves around armed conflict?

10:12.318 --> 10:13.518
Let me ask you a question.

10:13.569 --> 10:15.453
Where do people from
New Jersey vacation?

10:15.521 --> 10:17.188
Um, I don't know.

10:17.239 --> 10:19.190
I-I would imagine they vacation

10:19.258 --> 10:20.709
all over the place.
Okay. And you're...

10:20.793 --> 10:23.078
you're aware the fact
that perhaps many people

10:23.162 --> 10:25.196
from New Jersey vacation
here in Hawaii?

10:25.197 --> 10:26.906
I'm sure some misguided people
do, sure, yeah.

10:26.907 --> 10:27.525
Okay, good.

10:27.550 --> 10:30.012
And how many Hawaiians do you
think vacation in New Jersey?

10:30.037 --> 10:30.752
I don't know.

10:30.753 --> 10:32.337
I can help you with that answer
if you want.

10:32.388 --> 10:33.972
The answer is zero, Danny,

10:34.040 --> 10:35.373
because nobody here, except you,

10:35.441 --> 10:37.242
wants to be there, okay?

10:37.310 --> 10:39.978
Because aside from a
couple of great singers,

10:40.046 --> 10:41.212
- New Jersey doesn't exactly scream...
- Oh, oh...

10:41.280 --> 10:42.681
Whoa, a few great singers?

10:42.732 --> 10:45.350
- Sinatra, Springsteen...
- Right.

10:45.418 --> 10:47.435
A few great sing...
Jonathan Bon Jovi.

10:47.520 --> 10:49.154
I'm sorry, Bon Jovi?

10:49.221 --> 10:50.655
Absolutely Bon Jovi.
You serious?

10:50.723 --> 10:52.223
He's right up there.
"You Give Love a Bad Name,"

10:52.291 --> 10:53.491
"Wanted Dead or Alive,"
Now you're giving me song titles.

10:53.559 --> 10:55.327
I love it.
I'm giving you classic song titles.

10:55.394 --> 10:56.961
Look, all I'm saying is,
it's cool with me

10:57.029 --> 10:58.730
if you want to have a photo
of Grace, okay,

10:58.798 --> 11:02.033
but any other additions
and decorations

11:02.084 --> 11:04.085
to the interior of this vehicle
should be treated

11:04.170 --> 11:06.621
like a wiretap request
where you need my authorization.

11:06.706 --> 11:09.307
You can ride in the trunk
if you don't like it.

11:09.375 --> 11:10.642
I'll get real Jersey

11:10.710 --> 11:11.960
up in this piece.

11:12.044 --> 11:13.311
Look at this.

11:13.379 --> 11:15.013
General Pak's
got a fan club.

11:24.757 --> 11:25.724
This makes me so sick.

11:25.775 --> 11:27.192
We might have to take a bullet

11:27.259 --> 11:29.160
for this guy.
If we do our job right,

11:29.228 --> 11:30.762
that's not going to happen.

11:30.813 --> 11:32.480
Even if we get her, I mean,

11:32.565 --> 11:34.265
what are the chances
she's working alone?

11:34.316 --> 11:36.568
Not only are we going to find
her; we're going to find her,

11:36.635 --> 11:38.319
and then we're going to squeeze
her to flip on her partners.

11:38.404 --> 11:39.704
Yeah, well, I just want you
to know something.

11:39.772 --> 11:41.706
When I took an oath
to protect people,

11:41.774 --> 11:43.775
General Pak is not who
I had in mind.

11:45.611 --> 11:47.612
Me, either.

11:49.465 --> 11:51.416
<i>We pulled a partial print</i>

11:51.484 --> 11:53.351
off the "do not disturb" sign
she touched.

11:53.419 --> 11:55.120
Everything else appeared
to be wiped down.

11:55.187 --> 11:57.055
We ran it. No hits
in the system yet, though.

11:57.123 --> 11:58.256
What's all this?

11:58.324 --> 11:59.491
Well, you mentioned
on the phone

11:59.558 --> 12:01.125
that you didn't have
a clean, full shot

12:01.177 --> 12:03.595
of the assassin's face,
so I built one.

12:03.646 --> 12:05.530
I pulled two different camera
stills off the security footage.

12:05.598 --> 12:08.767
This left full profile
is from the bar,

12:08.818 --> 12:09.768
and this right profile

12:09.819 --> 12:11.102
is when they exited
the elevator.

12:14.106 --> 12:16.141
I grabbed bits and pieces
from other shots

12:16.208 --> 12:18.142
and added them
to the two base images

12:18.194 --> 12:19.327
and created
a composite.

12:20.830 --> 12:22.213
Wow.
Nice work.

12:22.281 --> 12:23.815
The guy built a face.
Okay, listen.

12:23.866 --> 12:25.149
Add the prints you pulled

12:25.201 --> 12:27.368
and circulate this picture
to HPD,

12:27.453 --> 12:28.720
NCIC, FBI, Interpol

12:28.788 --> 12:29.954
and airport
and marina securities.

12:30.005 --> 12:31.956
Kono, keep digging
into General Pak's background.

12:32.007 --> 12:33.925
I want to know if he
has any enemies at home

12:33.993 --> 12:35.760
who may want to
target him here.

12:35.828 --> 12:37.495
We also need a list of
protestors that were

12:37.563 --> 12:39.230
at the Summit that HPD has
on a watch list

12:39.298 --> 12:40.432
for making threats.

12:40.499 --> 12:42.634
I'll do that.

12:42.685 --> 12:44.636
Just remember, General Pak
has a lot of people

12:44.687 --> 12:46.438
who hate him, so don't confuse
making a threat

12:46.505 --> 12:47.555
with being one.

12:47.640 --> 12:48.907
Forget the cranks
and focus on the people

12:48.974 --> 12:50.275
who actually
have the means

12:50.342 --> 12:53.344
to pull something like this off.

12:53.395 --> 12:55.146
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to go back

12:55.214 --> 12:57.065
to the Summit, review
site protection with Taylor.

12:57.149 --> 12:59.384
Call me if you get anything.
You got it.

13:09.748 --> 13:10.803
Chin, what's up?

13:10.806 --> 13:13.574
A parking valet at the hotel
recognized that woman

13:13.642 --> 13:15.359
from the picture I composited.

13:15.444 --> 13:16.694
He says he remembers her

13:16.779 --> 13:18.312
not only because she
was uniquely beautiful,

13:18.363 --> 13:21.597
but also because she pulled up
in a battered old Ford Taurus,

13:21.598 --> 13:24.383
slipped him $50 and asked him
to keep it out front.

13:24.434 --> 13:27.126
According to him,
it was an interesting paradox.

13:27.127 --> 13:28.528
Okay, tell me you got a plate.

13:28.595 --> 13:29.729
Yeah, I did.

13:29.797 --> 13:31.698
Hotel logs plates
whenever a car checks in.

13:31.765 --> 13:33.833
It's for insurance purposes.

13:33.901 --> 13:35.702
I'm heading to the house now
with HPD backup.

13:35.769 --> 13:36.936
Perfect. I'll meet you there.

13:36.987 --> 13:38.037
Cordon off the neighborhood.

13:38.105 --> 13:39.372
Set a perimeter
around the house.

13:39.440 --> 13:40.773
What's the address?

13:52.803 --> 13:54.620
I want her alive.

14:16.944 --> 14:18.444
Clear.
Clear.

14:23.700 --> 14:26.686
Be aware-- suspects may be
holding civilians hostage.

14:39.216 --> 14:41.868
House is secure,
but you should see this.

14:47.007 --> 14:49.842
Looks like enough firepower
to take out the general.

14:49.910 --> 14:51.978
And his entire army.

14:53.413 --> 14:55.181
Guys, in the garage.

15:04.258 --> 15:06.058
That's the woman
who owns this house.

15:19.201 --> 15:20.757
<i>Used dishes in the sink.</i>

15:20.758 --> 15:23.026
Two weeks' worth
of uncollected mail.

15:23.077 --> 15:24.828
Medical examiner
thinks that's how long

15:24.896 --> 15:26.329
the body's been dead,
but he's got to wait

15:26.397 --> 15:28.031
for it to defrost
before he can do the autopsy.

15:28.099 --> 15:31.334
So, our suspect kills the woman,
takes her identity

15:31.402 --> 15:33.503
and uses her house
as a base of operations.

15:36.540 --> 15:37.641
Hi. This is Margaret.

15:37.708 --> 15:38.742
I'm not home right now.

15:38.810 --> 15:39.943
Leave me a message.

15:40.011 --> 15:41.728
Hey, Mom. It's Stephanie.

15:41.813 --> 15:43.180
We just got back from Spain.

15:43.247 --> 15:44.648
Wait till you see the photos.

15:44.715 --> 15:45.982
Call me. Love you.

15:46.050 --> 15:48.018
Bye.

15:48.069 --> 15:50.153
Call back and make
the family notification.

15:51.272 --> 15:52.739
Hey, Danny just called.
He's at HPD.

15:52.824 --> 15:54.348
He just got a hit
on a protest organizer

15:54.349 --> 15:56.138
you're going to want
to take a look at.

15:56.139 --> 15:57.272
His name is Nae Shan.

15:57.323 --> 15:58.657
Former member
of General Pak's army.

15:58.741 --> 16:01.176
Defected to Thailand,
and then he came here.

16:01.244 --> 16:02.244
He's been photographed

16:02.311 --> 16:03.512
at several protests
against General Pak.

16:03.579 --> 16:05.814
And HPD has him
on multiple arrests,

16:05.882 --> 16:07.382
including weapons sales.

16:07.450 --> 16:09.051
You think this guy
might be responsible

16:09.118 --> 16:10.719
for the arsenal
in the next room?

16:10.787 --> 16:12.387
I think whoever's behind this
has to have local help.

16:12.455 --> 16:14.456
Let's go say hello.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.775
Hey.

16:33.843 --> 16:34.860
Watch the door.

16:34.944 --> 16:36.078
He comes your way,

16:36.145 --> 16:37.212
don't let him
get past you.

16:37.280 --> 16:38.813
You got it.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.000
Got eyes on him.
He's headed your way.

16:59.051 --> 17:01.136
Hey, what's up, Nae Shan?

17:01.204 --> 17:02.604
You got a sec?

17:02.671 --> 17:04.339
Hey! Hey! Kono!

17:09.979 --> 17:11.113
Nae Shan.

17:11.180 --> 17:12.948
Officer Kono Kalakaua.
How you doing today?

17:15.017 --> 17:16.117
Why did you run?

17:16.185 --> 17:18.236
I don't like police.

17:18.320 --> 17:19.688
That's original.

17:22.492 --> 17:23.825
I'm going
to ask you questions.

17:23.910 --> 17:25.292
You're going
to give me answers.

17:25.361 --> 17:27.095
If you lie to me,
I'm going to throw

17:27.163 --> 17:29.080
you and your family
in an INS holding tank,

17:29.165 --> 17:31.266
and then I'm going to deport you
back to Sandimar.

17:31.334 --> 17:32.334
You understand?

17:33.369 --> 17:34.920
Good.

17:35.004 --> 17:36.204
You're a person of interest

17:36.255 --> 17:38.073
in an assassination plot
against General Pak.

17:40.343 --> 17:42.377
You think I want
to kill General Pak?

17:42.428 --> 17:43.711
I want to see
him brought

17:43.763 --> 17:45.230
before an international court
of justice.

17:47.183 --> 17:48.483
I want to see him humiliated.

17:48.551 --> 17:50.685
Death is too easy
for General Pak.

17:50.753 --> 17:52.554
He must admit what he did.

17:53.689 --> 17:55.824
What did he do to you?

18:01.230 --> 18:03.698
General Pak's soldiers
came in the morning

18:03.766 --> 18:05.634
when we were working
in the fields.

18:05.701 --> 18:07.402
They set fire to our houses,

18:07.470 --> 18:09.404
our crops.

18:09.472 --> 18:12.007
They burned everything.

18:12.074 --> 18:14.476
They shot two young men because
they said they were guerrillas.

18:14.544 --> 18:16.578
They were just boys.

18:16.646 --> 18:20.182
We tried to run,
but they rounded us up

18:20.249 --> 18:23.318
and forced us to walk
across a field.

18:23.386 --> 18:26.755
They blindfolded the
machine gunners.

18:26.823 --> 18:29.424
It was a game to them.

18:30.793 --> 18:31.943
They did not even aim.

18:32.028 --> 18:33.361
They just pulled
the triggers.

18:35.498 --> 18:37.499
The officers laughed.

18:37.567 --> 18:42.437
I watched as my oldest son
and my sister...

18:50.012 --> 18:53.148
I cannot close my eyes
without seeing.

18:53.216 --> 18:54.883
Now, those of us who were able

18:54.951 --> 18:58.553
to walk clear went into
the jungle, toward the border.

18:58.621 --> 19:02.324
We walked for ten days
with no food for the children,

19:02.391 --> 19:05.694
no medicine for the injured.

19:05.761 --> 19:07.762
Many died.

19:07.830 --> 19:09.397
And we were not
the only village.

19:09.465 --> 19:10.966
There were many.

19:11.033 --> 19:14.970
A million people living in
the jungle like animals.

19:16.239 --> 19:21.109
I hate General Pak,
but I am no murderer.

19:35.124 --> 19:37.492
What did she just say?

19:37.560 --> 19:40.228
She wants to know
why the police

19:40.296 --> 19:43.098
are protecting a monster
like General Pak.

19:43.165 --> 19:46.468
She asked how a man can do that

19:46.519 --> 19:49.638
and still call
himself a man.

20:00.526 --> 20:01.870
<i>What is it with you?</i>
<i>What do you do?</i>

20:01.871 --> 20:02.821
You attract conflict?

20:02.872 --> 20:04.039
I've been gone
for two hours,

20:04.123 --> 20:05.323
and you have
conducted two raids.

20:05.374 --> 20:06.458
What do you got planned
for lunch?

20:06.525 --> 20:08.426
Did you run Nae Shan's alibi?

20:08.494 --> 20:09.995
Yeah, he's clean.
He checks out.

20:10.046 --> 20:11.246
What is... what...
what are you doing here?

20:11.330 --> 20:12.914
I'm running additional
background on Agent Atwater.

20:12.999 --> 20:14.132
Something
doesn't make sense.

20:14.199 --> 20:16.134
Okay, just please
stop for a second.

20:16.201 --> 20:17.886
Now, we have a room
full of guns.

20:17.970 --> 20:19.537
All right, we need to be
looking for the people

20:19.605 --> 20:20.872
that were hired to fire them,

20:20.923 --> 20:22.223
not investigating
their murder victim,

20:22.308 --> 20:23.975
who's a decorated agent
with a spotless record.

20:24.043 --> 20:25.677
So tell me--
how does your decorated agent

20:25.745 --> 20:27.045
know about this
assassination plot?

20:27.113 --> 20:28.379
I don't know, okay?

20:28.431 --> 20:30.432
Same way we would--
an investigation, an informant.

20:30.627 --> 20:31.827
No. Matthews said that nobody

20:31.878 --> 20:33.957
on the detail
authorized an investigation.

20:33.958 --> 20:35.559
And if it was an informant,

20:35.626 --> 20:37.894
why didn't he download Matthews
on the first call?

20:37.962 --> 20:39.295
Why demand a face-to-face?

20:39.347 --> 20:41.130
I don't know--
because he didn't want to relay

20:41.182 --> 20:42.966
that kind of information
over the phone. All right?

20:43.034 --> 20:44.968
Atwater said that he wanted
to meet Matthews alone.

20:45.036 --> 20:46.770
All right, maybe he
was going to report

20:46.837 --> 20:47.961
a threat inside
the protective detail.

20:47.962 --> 20:49.498
Maybe it was someone he knew,
maybe a friend.

20:49.499 --> 20:51.250
All right, or maybe Atwater
was the inside man--

20:51.335 --> 20:53.302
part of the team behind
this room full of guns

20:53.370 --> 20:54.955
that are going to be used
for the assassination.

20:54.956 --> 20:57.874
We have zero evidence
connecting Atwater to this plot.

20:57.959 --> 20:59.025
But why kill him?

20:59.093 --> 21:00.360
He's not running the detail.

21:00.428 --> 21:02.045
He didn't set the route.

21:02.130 --> 21:05.215
I mean, Atwater is
an advance man.

21:05.299 --> 21:07.801
What made Agent David Atwater
so dangerous to these people

21:07.852 --> 21:10.637
that they had him killed
before General Pak arrived?

21:10.705 --> 21:13.006
Wait a minute. Hold on.
This hurts my head.

21:13.057 --> 21:15.809
All right, if you're right
and Atwater was compromised,

21:15.860 --> 21:18.028
the only reason
that he would call Matthews...

21:20.248 --> 21:22.849
...is to come clean,
turn himself in.

21:22.900 --> 21:25.318
Kill him before he can reveal
the how and where.

21:25.369 --> 21:26.319
You're good.

21:26.370 --> 21:27.587
I know.
No luck

21:27.655 --> 21:28.905
with the assassin's
photo canvass.

21:28.990 --> 21:30.624
No hits at the airport
or marinas yet.

21:30.691 --> 21:31.825
Prints from the hotel room

21:31.876 --> 21:33.293
match prints
from the dead woman's home.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.628
It's the same killer.

21:34.695 --> 21:36.963
And we also got a hit
from the Interpol Red Notice.

21:39.500 --> 21:41.301
CIA.

21:42.503 --> 21:45.372
It's a locked NFN file--
National Security.

21:45.440 --> 21:47.040
Even you don't have the
clearance required to view it.

21:48.242 --> 21:50.310
Oh, good. So the killer's CIA?

21:50.378 --> 21:52.012
Ex-CIA would be my bet.

21:52.063 --> 21:54.815
So does anyone know anyone that
can open a locked CIA file?

21:54.916 --> 21:57.067
I might.

22:01.856 --> 22:03.440
<i>Nick, we ran</i>
<i>the assassin's prints</i>

22:03.524 --> 22:05.659
and composite through the
databases and got a hit.

22:05.726 --> 22:07.828
Got a hit at Langley.

22:07.895 --> 22:10.363
Langley?

22:10.812 --> 22:12.630
How long was she
with the Company?

22:12.747 --> 22:13.948
We don't know anything
about her.

22:14.015 --> 22:15.182
I mean,
it's a locked file.

22:15.250 --> 22:17.251
But, uh, was kinda hoping
you could help.

22:17.302 --> 22:19.386
A locked file goes all the way
to the top,

22:19.454 --> 22:20.888
but I may know someone
that can unlock it.

22:20.956 --> 22:22.723
I'll make a call.

22:24.142 --> 22:25.392
Come here
for a second.

22:25.460 --> 22:27.144
I mean, it must
be really nice

22:27.229 --> 22:29.847
having friends that can open
a top secret CIA black file.

22:29.931 --> 22:32.233
Yeah, it is.

22:32.300 --> 22:34.068
I'm sorry. Is there a question?

22:34.135 --> 22:36.020
- What do you want to know?
- Who is that guy?

22:36.104 --> 22:38.906
Before he worked
private security,

22:38.973 --> 22:40.541
Nick was Special Activities
Division.

22:40.642 --> 22:43.110
Special Activities? What kind
of special activities did he do?

22:43.178 --> 22:45.379
SAD is the military arm
of the CIA.

22:45.447 --> 22:46.480
Oh, really?
Yeah.

22:46.531 --> 22:47.748
I thought you guys were
Navy SEALs?

22:47.815 --> 22:49.416
When you have certain
specialties,

22:49.484 --> 22:51.418
you can be recruited

22:51.486 --> 22:52.586
into different units
as needed.

22:52.654 --> 22:54.255
Are you gonna answer
any one of my questions?

22:54.322 --> 22:55.205
What do you want to know?

22:55.290 --> 22:56.757
What was his specialty?

22:56.825 --> 22:58.425
It's classified information,
Danny.

22:58.493 --> 23:00.828
- Okay. What was your specialty?
- I can't tell you that either.

23:00.896 --> 23:03.063
Okay, please, you have done
this before. Where was that?

23:03.131 --> 23:06.684
When exactly
was that?

23:06.768 --> 23:08.218
I worked the other side.

23:08.303 --> 23:09.637
The other side's
a sniper rifle.

23:09.704 --> 23:12.005
Was that your
specialty?

23:12.057 --> 23:13.974
<i>Her name is Erica Raines.</i>

23:14.025 --> 23:16.026
She was with the Company
for nine years.

23:16.111 --> 23:17.177
Recruited right out of college,

23:17.228 --> 23:20.614
A virtual ghost
in the community.

23:20.682 --> 23:21.815
She's a mechanic

23:21.883 --> 23:22.950
and a very good one.

23:23.018 --> 23:24.118
A mechanic?

23:24.185 --> 23:25.119
An assassin.

23:25.186 --> 23:26.153
Mechanic.

23:26.204 --> 23:27.354
Okay, look.

23:27.405 --> 23:30.190
Nick, can you just do me a favor
and just stop?

23:30.241 --> 23:31.742
All right?

23:31.826 --> 23:33.527
From now on, the Company
is the CIA.

23:33.578 --> 23:36.463
Right? The mechanic
is the assassin, and please,

23:36.531 --> 23:39.583
let's stop referring
to what you people do as

23:39.668 --> 23:41.235
"the community."
You're not a community.

23:41.303 --> 23:43.504
The Amish people,
they have a community.

23:43.555 --> 23:44.939
Let's just say what things are,

23:45.006 --> 23:46.707
please?

23:46.775 --> 23:49.877
She specialized in seducing her
targets and killing 'em.

23:49.945 --> 23:51.545
She had an op
go bad in Jordan,

23:51.596 --> 23:53.097
went off the grid for two years.

23:53.181 --> 23:55.883
Next time she appeared on the
Agency's radar she was a gun

23:55.951 --> 23:58.886
for hire with no loyalty to any
government or organization.

23:58.954 --> 24:00.521
Oh, good, maybe

24:00.588 --> 24:02.439
we can hire her to kill herself.

24:02.524 --> 24:05.159
We got a hit on our picture
canvass.

24:05.226 --> 24:06.393
She's been spotted
at Aloha Tower

24:06.444 --> 24:08.495
buying a ticket
for Josephine Cruise Lines.

24:08.563 --> 24:09.897
Okay, so she's trying to escape
to another island.

24:09.965 --> 24:11.966
And fly out from there.

24:12.033 --> 24:13.534
We need her alive.

24:13.601 --> 24:15.502
She's our only link to whoever's
behind this assassination plot.

What kind

26:44.512 --> 26:46.680
of an animal brings his wife
and his kid to a place

26:46.731 --> 26:47.814
where he knows people
are trying to kill him?

26:47.882 --> 26:49.066
The kind that loves
a good photo op.

26:49.150 --> 26:51.435
Yeah. He wants people to see him
as a father and husband,

26:51.519 --> 26:54.354
not a mass murderer.

26:55.360 --> 26:57.895
Hey, did you get anything
off the assassin's phone?

26:57.980 --> 26:59.313
No. HPD's scrubbing it now.

We're gonna hole up here

30:57.907 --> 31:00.859
Multiple agents down

He's extremely dangerous.

Tun. I like that name.

31:45.488 --> 31:48.123
Hey, Tun,
can I tell you a secret?

31:50.359 --> 31:52.127
I'm scared, too.

31:52.194 --> 31:53.662
You have a gun.

31:53.729 --> 31:55.397
Why are you scared?

31:55.464 --> 31:57.132
Just 'cause I have a gun

31:57.199 --> 31:58.967
doesn't mean
I don't get scared.

Hey, when all those people
started shooting,

32:05.841 --> 32:08.243
you didn't even cry.

32:08.311 --> 32:09.744
And you never left
your mommy's side.

32:09.812 --> 32:11.146
You made sure she was safe.

32:11.213 --> 32:13.348

Help will be here, soon.

32:41.363 --> 32:44.432
Why do you think
I brought my family here?

32:44.483 --> 32:45.633
I don't know.

32:45.701 --> 32:47.168
You're a murderer,
who cares?

32:47.236 --> 32:50.705
My family's here because
I'm seeking political asylum.

32:56.345 --> 32:57.745
That's why you couldn't
postpone the trip.

32:57.813 --> 32:59.814
That's why everybody's
trying to kill you.

32:59.882 --> 33:01.883
Let me get this straight.

33:01.950 --> 33:03.668
So you commit all these
horrible, horrible crimes,

33:03.752 --> 33:06.891
and then you come over to the
United States, and you say,

33:06.959 --> 33:08.293
"Hey, I'd like to make
a deal now. Please."

33:08.361 --> 33:11.629
I'm going to testify
at the U.N.

33:11.697 --> 33:13.732
against a military junta
and my chairman.

33:13.799 --> 33:18.103
I am going to admit to the world

33:18.170 --> 33:20.638
what I've done and pay
for the crimes I've committed.

33:21.263 --> 33:22.463
Well, that's...
that's good, man.

33:23.449 --> 33:24.666
You should've told us, okay?

33:24.734 --> 33:25.867
Somebody should have told us.

33:25.935 --> 33:28.036
The information
was too dangerous.

33:28.104 --> 33:30.405
That information is more
dangerous if I don't have it!

33:30.456 --> 33:32.207
My entire team
could have been killed.

33:32.258 --> 33:33.341
Not to mention your family.

33:33.409 --> 33:35.477
My testimony will end the war!

33:37.013 --> 33:38.513
The suffering.

33:40.449 --> 33:43.018
You save me, and my family,

33:43.085 --> 33:46.188
and you save a country.

33:54.113 --> 33:55.564
It's HPD.

34:05.741 --> 34:06.875
Those aren't cops!

34:06.943 --> 34:08.009

34:08.077 --> 34:09.043
Get away from the door!

34:10.181 --> 34:11.668
Where are the police?

34:11.752 --> 34:12.952
Where is help? Where's help?

34:13.020 --> 34:15.170
Help's not coming.

34:22.715 --> 34:24.549
How the hell
did they know we're here?

34:26.686 --> 34:28.487
My cell phone is dead.

34:28.554 --> 34:29.654
Same. Internet, too.

34:31.123 --> 34:32.524
Everything's dead.

34:32.592 --> 34:34.626
I got full bars.

34:34.694 --> 34:36.495
Wait a minute.

34:36.562 --> 34:38.929
Taylor's killed your signals,
and he's cloned mine.

34:38.998 --> 34:40.532
What?
He's cloned my cell phone.

34:40.600 --> 34:43.518
Before, I wasn't talking
to 911 operators,

34:43.585 --> 34:44.870
I was talking to his team.

34:45.705 --> 34:47.456
HPD has no idea where we are.

34:47.523 --> 34:49.357
I told you
that I hated that guy.

34:49.442 --> 34:50.641
Danny, take the upstairs.

34:50.710 --> 34:53.978
Chin, get the gas can off
the bench in the shed.

34:54.030 --> 34:55.213
General, bring your family.

34:57.083 --> 34:59.201
No matter what happens,
no matter what you hear,

34:59.285 --> 35:00.652
you stay in this room,
you understand?

35:00.703 --> 35:02.337
Yes.

35:02.422 --> 35:03.889
Let's go.

35:06.759 --> 35:08.760
Kono, find me some rags.

35:13.800 --> 35:15.383
I'm going to head up with Danny.

35:15.468 --> 35:17.469
Go.

35:25.778 --> 35:28.079
Agent Atwater...

35:28.147 --> 35:31.583
was working with us for months.

35:31.651 --> 35:33.885
He was fully prepared

35:33.953 --> 35:36.121
to kill the general
for money, but...

35:36.189 --> 35:38.757
he drew the line
at his wife and child.

35:38.825 --> 35:40.358
I don't share that conflict.

35:40.426 --> 35:41.393
How about you, Steve?

35:41.461 --> 35:42.994
You son of a bitch.

35:43.062 --> 35:46.264
Are you really prepared
to sacrifice your entire team

35:46.332 --> 35:50.469
and a woman and child,
for a corrupt general

35:50.536 --> 35:52.404
who's killed thousands
of innocent people?

35:52.472 --> 35:54.473
I fought beside you, Nick.

35:54.540 --> 35:55.707
For years.

35:55.775 --> 35:57.108
We were friends.

35:57.176 --> 35:59.444
That's the only reason
you're still alive.

35:59.512 --> 36:02.547
Give me the general and
no one else has to get hurt.

36:02.615 --> 36:03.748
That's not going to happen.

36:03.816 --> 36:06.618
Well, then, everyone
in that house is dead.

36:06.686 --> 36:08.420
What happened to you, Nick?

36:08.488 --> 36:10.655
I killed for God
and country for years.

36:10.723 --> 36:14.659
I figured it was about time
I got paid for it.

36:14.727 --> 36:18.530
$9 million
to keep Pak from testifying.

36:18.598 --> 36:19.898
I'll cut you in, Steve.

36:19.966 --> 36:22.167
All you got to do
is put a bullet in him.

36:22.235 --> 36:26.104
You know what? I'll put a bullet
in you first. How's that?

36:26.172 --> 36:28.073
Well, I'm glad to see
civilian life

36:28.140 --> 36:29.407
hasn't dulled
your sense of humor.

36:29.475 --> 36:31.476
You trained me, remember?

36:31.544 --> 36:33.678
I know your moves.

36:33.746 --> 36:34.913
Why don't you come down here.

36:34.981 --> 36:37.449
I'll show you a couple
of moves you missed.

36:37.517 --> 36:39.017
Should have taken the deal.

36:39.085 --> 36:42.687
By the way,
that's a nasty cut on your eye.

36:45.691 --> 36:48.660
He's to the north,
maybe 300 meters.

36:48.728 --> 36:50.729
Stay down. He's not
going to miss again.

37:02.708 --> 37:04.326
They got to be getting close..

37:04.410 --> 37:05.827
This'll slow them down.

37:11.918 --> 37:13.468
Go, Kono, go!

37:34.574 --> 37:35.857
I'm out.

37:37.577 --> 37:38.643
Me, too.

37:38.711 --> 37:39.744
Here they come!

38:02.301 --> 38:04.669
Definitely the fall
that killed him.

38:04.737 --> 38:06.071
Yeah. Definitely.

Go check on the general
and his family.

40:20.322 --> 40:22.574
You have got to start
doing a better job

40:22.641 --> 40:23.675
of picking your friends.

40:23.743 --> 40:26.010
Tell me about.
I picked you, didn't I?

40:27.146 --> 40:29.247
Yeah.

41:16.095 --> 41:18.713
I will accept
whatever punishment

41:18.798 --> 41:22.066
the International Court
hands down for my crimes.

41:24.303 --> 41:27.739
Today is the first day
my son is proud of his father.

41:30.109 --> 41:32.143
Thank you.

41:47.126 --> 41:48.943
You okay?

41:50.613 --> 41:52.614
Yeah.

41:54.099 --> 41:56.301
I should've known.

41:56.368 --> 41:58.419
No, you shouldn't have.
How could you have known?

41:58.504 --> 41:59.671
You knew.

41:59.738 --> 42:01.539
No, no, no. I suspected.
There's a big difference.

42:01.590 --> 42:04.008
And the view is a lot different
from where I was standing.

42:04.076 --> 42:05.710
This guy Taylor
was your friend.

42:05.761 --> 42:07.428
He used that
to his advantage.

42:07.513 --> 42:09.797
But this is really,
really good news.

42:09.882 --> 42:12.600
I mean, you are a human being.

42:12.685 --> 42:14.936
Which is good news to me,
because I had no idea.

42:17.122 --> 42:20.758
Well... you got good instincts,
partner.

42:20.809 --> 42:21.926
Right.

42:21.961 --> 42:24.812
- Longboards on me?
- Absolutely.

42:26.398 --> 42:27.732
Can I see your
wallet, please?

42:27.783 --> 42:29.067
What?

42:29.134 --> 42:30.818
Well, last time you
offered to buy me a drink,

42:30.903 --> 42:32.103
you conveniently
left your wallet

42:32.171 --> 42:33.321
and I got stuck for the...

42:33.405 --> 42:35.273
You don't have
your wallet, do you?

42:35.324 --> 42:37.041
It's like I said, you
got good instincts.
