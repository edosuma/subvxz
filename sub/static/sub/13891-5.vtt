00:37.884 --> 00:39.524
Ah! Morning, sir. Ohh!

00:40.291 --> 00:42.531
I just love the hum of the air con

00:42.627 --> 00:44.747
first thing in the morning.
Don't you, sir?

00:44.811 --> 00:47.211
Makes you just want to
leap out of bed and mop!

00:48.691 --> 00:51.211
- Morning, Krytes.
- Oh, something wrong, sir?

00:51.211 --> 00:52.811
Something getting you down?

00:52.811 --> 00:56.531
Is it that you're the last human
being alive with no life, no family,

00:56.531 --> 00:58.891
no future, no prospects,
no hope, is it...

00:58.891 --> 01:01.211
Is it something to do with that, sir?

01:01.211 --> 01:02.931
Somethin' to do with that,
Kryten, yeah.

01:02.931 --> 01:05.971
You're missing the human race again,
aren't you, sir?

01:05.971 --> 01:08.651
Really missing 'em today, Krytes.

01:08.651 --> 01:10.371
I just can't believe it's all over.

01:10.371 --> 01:12.531
I've been lookin' at
some old pictures of them,

01:12.531 --> 01:14.091
remind me of the old days.

01:14.091 --> 01:16.371
Look, there's a picture
of them going to work.

01:16.371 --> 01:18.291
Oh.

01:18.291 --> 01:19.411
Commuters, mmm.

01:19.411 --> 01:20.851
There's another one. Look.

01:20.851 --> 01:22.811
- They're all laughing.
- Oh!

01:22.811 --> 01:24.331
New Years, Titan.

01:24.331 --> 01:26.811
We were so happy back then, Kryt.

01:26.811 --> 01:29.931
I had a species, I thought
the two of us'd be together for ever.

01:29.931 --> 01:32.531
Well, it may sound ridiculous now,
sir,

01:32.531 --> 01:34.291
but one day, I'm sure you'll meet

01:34.291 --> 01:36.851
another species
that'll make you just as happy.

01:37.971 --> 01:41.131
No, I won't! No species'll make me
happy like the human race.

01:41.131 --> 01:44.211
I'll never find another species
like them. They were...

01:44.211 --> 01:45.771
They were special.

01:45.771 --> 01:49.251
Sir, all I'm saying is
there are other species out there,

01:49.251 --> 01:51.491
and given time, who knows?

01:51.491 --> 01:54.211
You never liked the human race,
did you?

01:54.211 --> 01:57.571
Quite honestly, sir, I never thought
they were good enough for you.

01:58.811 --> 02:00.811
I never thought
they were very nice to you, sir.

02:00.811 --> 02:03.531
Quite frankly, sir,
I think you could do better.

02:03.531 --> 02:05.971
- What, better than the human race?
- Mmm.

02:05.971 --> 02:09.091
It may sound harsh, but you've just
got to get them out of your mind

02:09.091 --> 02:10.451
and get on with your life.

02:10.451 --> 02:13.411
Yeah, but everywhere I look
reminds me of 'em.

02:13.411 --> 02:17.491
A couple of beers later on today,
sir. That'll take your mind off it.

02:17.491 --> 02:18.771
The human race invented beer.

02:20.451 --> 02:21.971
They were brilliant at inventin'.

02:21.971 --> 02:26.451
They invented sofas and blankets
and mops and floors and buckets.

02:26.451 --> 02:29.251
I just miss them so much.

02:29.251 --> 02:31.251
A change of scenery, sir,
that's what you need.

02:31.251 --> 02:33.491
Why don't you get out
and stretch your legs?

02:33.491 --> 02:34.771
The human race had legs.

02:36.011 --> 02:37.451
I just can't get away from them.

02:37.451 --> 02:39.651
Everywhere I look,
it reminds me of them.

02:39.651 --> 02:41.411
Nothing compares to them.

02:41.411 --> 02:44.531
♪ Nothing compares

02:44.531 --> 02:48.011
♪ Nothing compares to them. ♪

02:48.011 --> 02:49.771
I knew they'd break his heart.

02:49.771 --> 02:51.131
Oh!

02:51.131 --> 02:53.211
Human race -
here one minute, gone the next.

02:53.211 --> 02:55.291
Fly-by-night flibbertigibbets!

02:57.771 --> 02:59.651
Life.

02:59.651 --> 03:01.371
What's it all about, then?

03:01.371 --> 03:03.491
Why are we all here? Why am I here?

03:03.491 --> 03:05.411
What's the point of everything?

03:05.411 --> 03:07.331
'I don't know, Dave.

03:07.331 --> 03:10.691
'White coffee, six sugars and a
caramel crisp bar coming right up!'

03:10.691 --> 03:12.331
Haven't you ever thought about it?

03:12.331 --> 03:15.691
'Not really, no.
I'm a vending machine.

03:15.691 --> 03:17.091
'Are you OK?

03:17.091 --> 03:19.611
'You don't seem
your usual self today,

03:19.611 --> 03:22.211
'asking intelligent questions,
being philosophical.'

03:22.211 --> 03:25.011
How d'you know
what my usual self is like?

03:25.011 --> 03:26.211
'I watch you.

03:27.291 --> 03:29.811
'Through the crack in your door.

03:29.811 --> 03:32.611
'The things you do
when you're alone are so funny!'

03:34.811 --> 03:36.371
I've gotta get going.

03:36.371 --> 03:37.811
'See you next time!

03:37.811 --> 03:41.571
'And if you want to talk things
through about life and stuff,
drop by any time.

03:41.571 --> 03:44.451
'Oh, except Thursday morning.
I might be out.

03:45.611 --> 03:47.091
'Just kidding!

03:47.091 --> 03:48.171
'I'll be here!'

03:49.811 --> 03:51.331
'For ever!'

04:03.451 --> 04:06.531
Subbuteo tournament this weekend,
Kryten.

04:06.531 --> 04:09.411
Not going out in the quarterfinals
three years in a row.

04:09.411 --> 04:12.851
Just putting the boys
through their paces.

04:12.851 --> 04:14.651
The flabsters don't know
what's hit them.

04:22.651 --> 04:25.131
Er, an e-post from the JMC
on-board computer, sir.

04:25.131 --> 04:26.531
Oh, yes? What do they want?

04:26.531 --> 04:29.491
They've had a significant amount
of letters over the years

04:29.491 --> 04:31.811
from high-ranking members
of the JMC, sir,

04:31.811 --> 04:34.211
proposing you to be awarded

04:34.211 --> 04:38.211
the Golden Stripe Of Honour
for your years
of distinguished service.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.371
Gosh. Really?

04:40.371 --> 04:43.771
They say they've been told
you're a modest man
who doesn't seek the limelight,

04:43.771 --> 04:47.291
for your only concern
is performing your duties.

04:47.291 --> 04:48.731
I'm lost for words.

04:48.731 --> 04:50.131
Such kindness.

04:50.131 --> 04:52.451
Due to the number
of these letters of recommendation,

04:52.451 --> 04:56.131
they have absolutely no option
but to request

04:56.131 --> 04:57.891
you stop writing them.

05:00.451 --> 05:03.491
Oh, bollocking damn
and jumbo buggers!

05:03.491 --> 05:05.571
They go on to say,
in dealing with this matter,

05:05.571 --> 05:08.571
they've looked into your actual
service record and have realised

05:08.571 --> 05:13.331
that you haven't reported for duty
in over three million years.

05:13.331 --> 05:15.171
But I've been dead for most of that!

05:15.171 --> 05:18.451
You are therefore being charged
with gross dereliction of duty

05:18.451 --> 05:21.411
and you have 24 hours
to present your rebuttal.

05:21.411 --> 05:22.651
What?!

05:22.651 --> 05:24.891
If they find you guilty, sir,
you'll be demoted...

05:24.891 --> 05:26.571
to third technician.

05:26.571 --> 05:28.131
The same as Lister?

05:28.131 --> 05:30.571
There'll be no-one but you to obey
my orders. What am I gonna do?

05:30.571 --> 05:32.011
Help me. That's an order.

05:32.011 --> 05:33.971
Oh, please, sir!
Don't order me to help you.

05:33.971 --> 05:35.851
You know how much I hate helping you!

05:35.851 --> 05:37.571
Kryten!

05:37.571 --> 05:39.571
Very well, sir.

05:39.571 --> 05:41.851
Perhaps you could get a note
from the medicomputer

05:41.851 --> 05:44.611
explaining you're unfit for duty.

05:44.611 --> 05:46.691
Post-traumatic stress or something.

05:46.691 --> 05:50.851
I haven't been the same
since the crew got wiped out -
need a note, post-dated.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.451
Too unwell to attend myself.

05:52.451 --> 05:53.731
Off you go.

05:53.731 --> 05:55.011
On my way, sir.

05:58.131 --> 06:00.051
Ahh, you!

06:00.051 --> 06:02.851
Still moping around
in your mopey clothes,

06:02.851 --> 06:06.731
listening to your mopey music,
being all mopey?

06:06.731 --> 06:10.171
- If you want my opinion...
- Which I don't.

06:10.171 --> 06:12.051
..it's time you manned up.

06:12.051 --> 06:14.491
Listened to some brass band music.

06:14.491 --> 06:16.611
Went for a bracing hike
in the diesel decks.

06:17.931 --> 06:22.651
Given the options,
I'll continue being suicidal,
if it's all the same to you.

06:22.651 --> 06:25.251
And don't think this pity party's
going unnoticed.

06:25.251 --> 06:26.811
I've noticed it.

06:26.811 --> 06:29.131
And I've written it down
in a special report.

06:30.251 --> 06:34.131
And let me tell you, m'laddo,
I pull no punches.

06:34.131 --> 06:36.251
Who's gonna read this special report?

06:36.251 --> 06:37.451
Well, me.

06:38.571 --> 06:40.731
And maybe others...one day.

06:40.731 --> 06:42.851
And they'll read,

06:42.851 --> 06:45.411
"You are the star
of your own mopeathon.

06:45.411 --> 06:48.931
"You can't even be bothered
to get yourself
a cup of tea any more.

06:48.931 --> 06:51.011
"You dunk your biscuits
in the fish tank."

06:52.211 --> 06:53.731
I've seen you.

06:53.731 --> 06:55.571
I was watching TV!

06:55.571 --> 06:59.091
As long as it's wet and melty,
you don't care where you stick it.

07:01.051 --> 07:03.211
Look, Rimmer, I'm depressed, man.
Give me a break.

07:03.211 --> 07:05.691
And besides,
I'm a careful dunker now.

07:05.691 --> 07:07.291
Look left, look right,

07:07.291 --> 07:09.251
mirror, signal, dunk.

07:10.891 --> 07:13.371
It's time you stopped feeling sorry
for yourself, Lister.

07:13.371 --> 07:15.731
Every problem has an answer.

07:15.731 --> 07:17.971
Problem - your species is dead.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.491
Answer - make some more.

07:21.531 --> 07:23.171
And how am I gonna do that?

07:23.171 --> 07:25.371
Well, you've gotta prepare yourself,
haven't you?

07:25.371 --> 07:27.851
Like a fighter pilot
waiting to scramble.

07:27.851 --> 07:30.411
If the perfect woman
walked through that door right now -

07:30.411 --> 07:33.931
and by perfect, I mean
any female with working ovaries -

07:33.931 --> 07:35.851
you wouldn't have a clue.

07:35.851 --> 07:39.011
Perfect woman walked through that
door, I would be ready to scramble.

07:39.011 --> 07:42.811
What, you think your old moves
would still work today?

07:42.811 --> 07:46.091
You think that snaky,
sneaky, arm-round-the-shoulder trick

07:46.091 --> 07:48.331
in a dark cinema is still cool?

07:48.331 --> 07:51.811
Women today would die
laughing at that move.

07:51.811 --> 07:53.131
That was my best move.

07:54.451 --> 07:56.371
I had a lot of success
with that move.

07:56.371 --> 07:58.691
Women have moved on from that move.

07:58.691 --> 08:00.331
Moves don't move on.

08:00.331 --> 08:01.531
Moves move on.

08:01.531 --> 08:02.851
What, moves move?!

08:03.891 --> 08:05.491
Right, here's a Jacobean move.

08:05.491 --> 08:06.571
A Jaca-what?

08:13.251 --> 08:15.331
Oh, my lady!

08:16.731 --> 08:19.571
Thy beauty doth radiate
across the Earth,

08:19.571 --> 08:23.931
like a raging forest fire
consuming everything in its path,

08:23.931 --> 08:27.571
and reduces grown men
to babbling fools.

08:31.251 --> 08:33.211
Do you think that move
would work today?

08:33.211 --> 08:35.371
Not a chance - dead move.

08:35.371 --> 08:38.131
The cloak across the puddle -
dead move.

08:38.131 --> 08:41.371
Strumming a mandolin
under the balcony - dead move.

08:41.371 --> 08:44.131
How d'you know all this, Rimmer?
You know nothin' about women.

08:44.131 --> 08:45.771
You know nothin' about nothin'.

08:45.771 --> 08:48.091
Remember that documentary
we watched about breasts?

08:48.091 --> 08:50.491
You thought "areolas"
was a Spanish goalkeeper?

08:53.331 --> 08:54.971
Well, what was he, Italian?

08:56.011 --> 08:57.251
It's not important.

08:57.251 --> 09:00.371
Look, you've either got it
or you ain't, and I've got it.

09:00.371 --> 09:02.451
I'm gonna make meself
a cup of coffee.

09:09.451 --> 09:11.571
Right, abusing the furniture.

09:13.171 --> 09:15.411
It's all going down.

09:15.411 --> 09:17.691
Oh, thanks, 23.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.051
I really needed a lift.

09:19.051 --> 09:20.851
'No problem, David.

09:20.851 --> 09:22.691
'How was zat soup
I made you yesterday?'

09:22.691 --> 09:24.651
It was, er...pretty delicious,
actually.

09:24.651 --> 09:25.731
'Ah, bon!

09:25.731 --> 09:28.171
- 'I'm glad you enjoyed eet.'
- Yeah, it was really nice.

09:28.171 --> 09:29.651
'Magnifique!'

09:29.651 --> 09:31.851
So, um...you look different.

09:31.851 --> 09:34.171
Have you changed something?
New facade?

09:34.171 --> 09:37.171
Really suits you.
You look, er...shinier.

09:37.171 --> 09:39.171
'No, same facade as always.'

09:39.171 --> 09:40.571
Could've sworn it's different.

09:40.571 --> 09:43.571
- Maybe it's the light.
- 'Oui, maybe.'

09:43.571 --> 09:46.011
Oh, it's good coffee, this.
Great coffee.

09:46.011 --> 09:47.891
Some amazing coffee.

09:47.891 --> 09:50.971
I've always said to the others,
you know, if you want
a good cup of coffee,

09:50.971 --> 09:53.931
go to dispenser 23 -
she makes the best coffee.

09:53.931 --> 09:56.091
- 'Are you 'itting on me?'
- What? No!

09:56.091 --> 09:59.371
'I'm a vending machine -
why are you trying to 'it on me?'

09:59.371 --> 10:01.211
- I'm not trying to hit on you.
- 'You so are.'

10:01.211 --> 10:04.131
No, I'm not! I'm really not.
You just make good coffee,
that's all.

10:04.131 --> 10:07.411
'"New facade, you look shinier" -
zat was a move.'

10:07.411 --> 10:09.251
- It was not a move!
- 'It so was a move.

10:09.251 --> 10:10.771
'You were putting a move on me.'

10:10.771 --> 10:14.651
You're getting the wrong end of the
stick. It was not a move, now please!

10:14.651 --> 10:16.811
'Why are you 'itting on
a dispensing machine? Who does zat?'

10:16.811 --> 10:19.011
- I'm not! I mean...
- Is everything OK, sir?

10:19.011 --> 10:21.931
'You know what he just tried to do?
He was 'itting on me.'

10:21.931 --> 10:23.891
Hit...hitting on her! I mean...

10:23.891 --> 10:26.531
of course I wasn't hitting on her -
she's a vending machine!

10:26.531 --> 10:28.251
Why would I hit on a vending machine?

10:28.251 --> 10:30.691
I-I'm sure there's been
some misunderstanding here.

10:30.691 --> 10:32.011
He put his hand on my logo.

10:33.051 --> 10:34.091
What? When?

10:34.091 --> 10:36.531
Look, I was leaning,
it was a total accident!

10:36.531 --> 10:40.291
'Oh, leaning and you just happened
to place your hand
exactly on my logo.

10:41.531 --> 10:45.451
'"Oops, sorry, didn't notice it,"
he said, as he gently grazed
my logo.'

10:46.731 --> 10:49.491
Unbelievable!

10:49.491 --> 10:51.171
This is gonna go in the report.

10:54.811 --> 10:56.451
What news of my sabbatical?

10:56.451 --> 10:58.011
I'm afraid it's not good,
sir.

10:58.011 --> 11:01.091
The medicom said no?
It's never liked me.

11:01.091 --> 11:04.491
It's happy to give you a note
if you have a genuine reason
for time off,

11:04.491 --> 11:06.451
otherwise there's nothing doing.

11:06.451 --> 11:11.091
Although I got the impression
a charitable donation
to the medical fund

11:11.091 --> 11:12.771
might not go unnoticed.

11:12.771 --> 11:15.211
Hmm. A little bribe.

11:15.211 --> 11:17.011
Not a bribe, sir - a donation.

11:17.011 --> 11:18.411
A big donation.

11:18.411 --> 11:21.611
Mm! Where you gonna get
major moolah like that?

11:21.611 --> 11:23.971
Expenditure cuts, sir,
from the supplies budget.

11:23.971 --> 11:27.451
I've been looking at the ship's
inventory for potential savings,

11:27.451 --> 11:29.571
and it seems to me,
for a ship this size,

11:29.571 --> 11:31.731
with this many
toilet-active crew members...

11:31.731 --> 11:34.371
Toilet-active crew members?

11:34.371 --> 11:39.371
..there's an astonishing amount
of toilet paper
in the 2,143 restrooms

11:39.371 --> 11:40.931
going to waste.

11:40.931 --> 11:42.851
You what?!

11:42.851 --> 11:46.571
Toilet paper that never goes
into action,
never sees the field of battle.

11:46.571 --> 11:49.011
- Return the toilet paper!
- Hang on.

11:49.011 --> 11:51.691
Make the majority
of the restrooms paper-free.

11:51.691 --> 11:54.091
I-I need that toilet paper!

11:54.091 --> 11:55.851
Every sheet!

11:55.851 --> 11:59.651
I've got a diet
that's rich in fibre, curry and beer.

11:59.651 --> 12:01.811
The savings would be insane.

12:01.811 --> 12:05.931
We can get a reimbursement
from Supplies and transfer that
to the medical fund.

12:05.931 --> 12:09.651
As far as the supply budget
is concerned,
we're just moving money around.

12:09.651 --> 12:11.051
It's totally above board.

12:11.051 --> 12:12.851
I'll get on it right away.

12:12.851 --> 12:14.891
- Great plan.
- Lousy plan!

12:14.891 --> 12:19.491
Buds, I've got a question for you.
What's the best way
to break bad news?

12:19.491 --> 12:22.251
Well, generally speaking, sir,
you tell the people to sit down

12:22.251 --> 12:24.331
and warn them
that you've got bad news.

12:24.331 --> 12:26.211
And what kind of face you got on?

12:26.211 --> 12:27.651
A serious face, sir.

12:27.651 --> 12:29.131
Kindly but serious.

12:29.131 --> 12:30.811
Huh! Kindly but serious.

12:30.811 --> 12:32.331
That's what I thought!

12:32.331 --> 12:33.731
I knew that!

12:33.731 --> 12:34.931
Thanks, bud!

12:39.571 --> 12:42.251
Buds, best you sit down.
I've got some bad news.

12:42.251 --> 12:44.091
Whoa, what is it? What's happened?

12:44.091 --> 12:45.971
Is this about me?
It's about me, isn't it?

12:45.971 --> 12:47.891
I'm being replaced again,
aren't I, sir?

12:47.891 --> 12:49.971
Everyone's sitting down,
then you say,

12:49.971 --> 12:52.411
- "Listen, I've got bad news," right?
- That's correct, sir.

12:52.411 --> 12:54.011
OK, here comes the bad news.

12:54.011 --> 12:56.411
But I'm gonna do it as char-aydes!

12:56.411 --> 12:57.771
Char-aydes?

12:59.211 --> 13:01.091
He means "char-ahdes", sir.

13:01.091 --> 13:03.251
You know how much fun
there is round here? None!

13:03.251 --> 13:05.371
It's too good an opportunity to miss.

13:05.371 --> 13:07.131
OK, here we go.

13:07.131 --> 13:09.051
Remember, really bad news.

13:10.251 --> 13:11.331
Two words.

13:11.331 --> 13:12.571
Whole thing.

13:12.571 --> 13:16.171
Ho-hole. Er, black hole,
we're being sucked into a black hole.

13:16.171 --> 13:20.051
Er chameleonic mutants.
Er, er, er, brain-eating chameleonic
mutants on board.

13:20.051 --> 13:22.491
- A giant death worm!
- Something's happened to Kochanski.

13:22.491 --> 13:24.251
She's got a rogue virus.

13:24.251 --> 13:25.451
Rimmer's got a rogue virus.

13:25.451 --> 13:26.571
I've got a rogue virus?

13:26.571 --> 13:28.371
- Explosion?
- Zombies, zombies!

13:28.371 --> 13:31.691
I'm being replaced, aren't I, sir?
No-one likes me.
People have complained

13:31.691 --> 13:33.491
- about the shape of my head.
- Strangling...

13:33.491 --> 13:36.331
A giant death worm. Giant
death worm heading straight for us...

13:36.331 --> 13:38.531
Crash, something's crashed.

13:38.531 --> 13:40.731
Heading straight for us.
I'm being demoted.

13:40.731 --> 13:43.011
A woman! A woman's coming.

13:43.011 --> 13:46.051
- A woman. Shorter.
- Small woman. Small. Male, man.

13:46.051 --> 13:47.491
- Male.
- Post! Mail pod!

13:47.491 --> 13:49.811
Mail pod!

13:49.811 --> 13:51.171
The mail pod's arrived!

13:51.171 --> 13:52.731
Brilliant,
the mail pod's arrived!

13:52.731 --> 13:54.251
And something's happened to it.

13:54.251 --> 13:56.491
It's crashed.
The mail pod's crashed.

13:56.491 --> 13:58.451
- It exploded.
- It turned into a giant death worm.

13:58.451 --> 14:01.051
It's turned into a jacket.
- A giant death worm's come out of
it.

14:01.051 --> 14:02.651
This is nothing to do
with a giant death worm!

14:02.651 --> 14:04.131
Where were you getting that from?!

14:04.131 --> 14:07.251
Oh! Your clothes...your clothes
were on a...on a washing line...

14:07.251 --> 14:10.091
...and a mail pod came in
and crashed into your clothes!

14:10.091 --> 14:11.691
Got it in one!

14:14.731 --> 14:17.611
Your clothes are hanging on the line,
and the mail pod crashed into them?

14:17.611 --> 14:18.691
How's that two words?

14:18.691 --> 14:20.251
Cos when it happened, I said,

14:20.251 --> 14:21.731
"Oh, man!"

14:23.331 --> 14:26.011
You know, if I had a giant death worm
right now,

14:26.011 --> 14:28.051
I'd stick it right down
your stupid throat!

14:28.051 --> 14:29.531
Hey, the mail's arrived!

14:29.531 --> 14:31.931
Lighten up - mail from Earth!

14:31.931 --> 14:33.691
Death worm?!

14:33.691 --> 14:35.571
Two words!

14:49.454 --> 14:50.774
That's the last one, sirs.

14:51.974 --> 14:54.974
We must have sifted through
about 1,000 letters now.

14:54.974 --> 14:57.414
One letter from home,
that's all I'm asking -

14:57.414 --> 14:59.694
just one lousy, stinking letter.

14:59.694 --> 15:03.534
Look, 50 big ones
says the first letter's mine.

15:03.534 --> 15:05.974
Why is everything
a competition with you?

15:05.974 --> 15:10.054
Why can't we just sit here
and sort the mail
like two mature adults

15:10.054 --> 15:13.494
instead of behaving
like two schoolboys
who have to bet on everything?

15:15.534 --> 15:16.974
Oh, yes, I've got one!

15:18.454 --> 15:20.174
Arnold Rimmer!

15:20.174 --> 15:22.694
The man, the myth, the legend!
Rimmsy, Rimmsy!

15:22.694 --> 15:24.974
Mr Popular with a capital P,

15:24.974 --> 15:27.974
there's no stopping him,
here he goes!

15:27.974 --> 15:29.414
Who's it from?

15:29.414 --> 15:30.654
It's a parking fine.

15:33.534 --> 15:35.054
Still good.

15:35.054 --> 15:37.254
Still a letter -
something to read addressed to me.

15:37.254 --> 15:39.574
1-0, Rimmsy.

15:39.574 --> 15:41.374
Is it? Can it be?

15:41.374 --> 15:42.694
It can't be.

15:42.694 --> 15:43.974
Oh, but it is!

15:43.974 --> 15:46.174
1-1! The comeback kid!

15:46.174 --> 15:50.574
This boy does not know the meaning
of the word "defeat"!

15:50.574 --> 15:52.134
1-1!

15:52.134 --> 15:54.094
Go on, then, who's it from?

15:54.094 --> 15:56.014
Hayley Summers?

15:57.214 --> 15:59.014
My God, Hayley Summers!

15:59.014 --> 16:00.774
Hayley Summers!

16:00.774 --> 16:03.814
I'm guessing
it's from Hayley Summers?

16:03.814 --> 16:05.734
I used to go out with Hayley Summers.

16:05.734 --> 16:07.494
It's when I was trying
to be a rock god.

16:07.494 --> 16:11.014
What I lacked technically
I made up for in loudness.

16:11.014 --> 16:14.654
I mean, when I played,
people had ringing in their ears.

16:14.654 --> 16:16.294
How long for?

16:16.294 --> 16:19.374
It didn't go away. Once they
had it, they had it for good.

16:19.374 --> 16:20.694
That's how loud I was.

16:20.694 --> 16:23.414
So where did you meet her, then?
At a gig?

16:23.414 --> 16:25.934
She worked in the bank
where I had my overdraft.

16:25.934 --> 16:30.574
We got talking, and badda-boom,
badda-bish, badda-baa.

16:30.574 --> 16:32.774
And, um, she dumped you, right?

16:32.774 --> 16:34.694
No, she didn't dump me,
actually, Rimmer.

16:34.694 --> 16:37.454
She got offered a dream job on
Callisto, couldn't turn it down.

16:37.454 --> 16:39.934
The only girl I ever cared about
who didn't dump me, actually.

16:39.934 --> 16:42.174
The time we had together
was brilliant, man.

16:42.174 --> 16:46.814
We'd stay home all day Saturday,
watch zero-gee, eat curry in bed.

16:46.814 --> 16:49.774
The first person I ever heard say,
"The real McCoy".

16:49.774 --> 16:51.774
"That's the real McCoy," she'd say.

16:51.774 --> 16:55.014
"This is the real McCoy.
That curry is the real McCoy."

16:55.014 --> 16:59.774
And she squidged up her nose, like
that, when she was telling a story.

16:59.774 --> 17:01.214
No, no, it was really cute.

17:01.214 --> 17:03.294
And did you used to tell your friends

17:03.294 --> 17:05.414
about the real McCoy
and the squidgy nose thing?

17:05.414 --> 17:08.174
And did you find your friends
were suddenly emigrating

17:08.174 --> 17:09.694
or pretending to be dead?

17:11.294 --> 17:12.894
Still smells of her perfume.

17:12.894 --> 17:14.614
Look, I...I don't wanna read this.

17:14.614 --> 17:16.334
It'll make me miss home
more than ever.

17:16.334 --> 17:17.534
I'll read it.

17:21.814 --> 17:24.733
"Dear Dave, I hope
you don't mind me writing to you,

17:24.733 --> 17:27.414
- "but I've got a confession."
- Confession?

17:27.414 --> 17:28.493
Bet she was a man.

17:29.654 --> 17:34.094
Well, you said yourself
she liked zero-gee and curries.
Bet you she was a man.

17:34.094 --> 17:35.774
Did she have big feet?

17:36.814 --> 17:40.694
When you did the foxtrot,
did you ever wonder
why she was shaving?

17:40.694 --> 17:42.214
Just-just tell me the confession.

17:42.214 --> 17:43.814
- Oh, wow.
- What?

17:43.814 --> 17:45.894
- No way!
- What?!

17:45.894 --> 17:47.734
I don't know whether
to laugh or laugh.

17:49.094 --> 17:51.294
"Dave, I don't know
how to tell you this,

17:51.294 --> 17:52.654
"but I'm pregnant.

17:52.654 --> 17:54.934
"Seven weeks,
according to the doctor."

17:54.934 --> 17:58.014
Pregnant? Hang on,
my head's on spin cycle here.

17:58.014 --> 18:00.654
Are you saying that I'm three
million years into deep space

18:00.654 --> 18:02.134
and she's pregnant with my baby?!

18:03.254 --> 18:05.734
Well, put it this way -
you're in the finals.

18:05.734 --> 18:07.214
Finals? What d'you mean?

18:07.214 --> 18:09.254
Who's the other finalist?
Who am I playing?

18:09.254 --> 18:11.454
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah...

18:11.454 --> 18:14.014
"I don't know whether
it's yours or Roy's.

18:14.014 --> 18:15.814
"Thought you should know."

18:15.814 --> 18:16.854
Roy?

18:18.374 --> 18:19.774
Ah, not Roy?!

18:20.934 --> 18:22.614
Not Roy Roy!

18:22.614 --> 18:24.694
D'you mean she was sleeping with Roy?

18:25.854 --> 18:27.294
Who's the dad, me or him?

18:27.294 --> 18:29.814
She doesn't know,
she's going for a DNA test.

18:30.934 --> 18:34.414
She must've written another letter
to tell me the result.

18:34.414 --> 18:37.134
You've gotta help me find it,
we need to find it. Yellow envelope.

18:37.134 --> 18:38.134
Yellow envelope!

18:41.614 --> 18:44.494
Hi, 34. Just having a break.
Coffee, please.

18:44.494 --> 18:47.174
'Oh, you want something
from me now, do you?'

18:47.174 --> 18:48.734
Yeah, coffee.

18:48.734 --> 18:51.894
'Don't play dumb, Dave.
I heard what happened.'

18:51.894 --> 18:54.694
- Happened?
- 'With dispensing machine 23.

18:54.694 --> 18:56.974
'You didn't think
I'd find out, did you?'

18:56.974 --> 18:59.414
- What?!
- 'All those drinks

18:59.414 --> 19:02.334
'and chocolate bars you were getting
off me, and at the same time,

19:02.334 --> 19:06.294
'you were drinking her drinks
and snaffling up her choccy bars,
too, weren't you?

19:06.294 --> 19:07.654
'Weren't you?!'

19:07.654 --> 19:09.014
She was just nearer.

19:09.014 --> 19:11.574
'She's such a trashy-looking machine.

19:11.574 --> 19:14.214
'Is that what you like, Dave?
Trashy?'

19:14.214 --> 19:15.854
You all look identical!

19:15.854 --> 19:18.774
- 'Ohh!'
- Look, can I please just get
a coffee?

19:18.774 --> 19:20.414
- 'I'm out of coffee.'
- I'll have a tea.

19:20.414 --> 19:21.494
'No tea.'

19:21.494 --> 19:22.814
Milkshake?

19:22.814 --> 19:23.934
'Let me just check.

19:23.934 --> 19:25.774
'Sorry, no milkshakes either.'

19:25.774 --> 19:29.774
Look, I'll go somewhere else, then.
You're not the only dispenser
on board.

19:29.774 --> 19:33.334
'Why don't you do that?
I think it might be best all round.'

19:33.334 --> 19:34.614
Well, I will.

19:34.614 --> 19:35.934
- 'Good.'
- Fine.

19:35.934 --> 19:37.894
- 'Suits me.'
- Right, I'm off.

19:37.894 --> 19:39.574
'Not missing you already.'

19:39.574 --> 19:43.054
Coincidentally, no big deal,
but know your tea -

19:43.054 --> 19:44.414
it's a bit watery.

19:44.414 --> 19:48.334
And you know when I said
that your Mexican red-hot chilli
crisps were really spicy?

19:48.334 --> 19:49.694
Well, I was lying.

19:49.694 --> 19:52.174
- 'I can't believe you said that!'
- Well, I did.

19:52.174 --> 19:53.654
'Ohh!'

20:08.254 --> 20:10.254
How did it go with the medicomputer?

20:10.254 --> 20:11.654
Well, it took the donation, sir.

20:11.654 --> 20:12.894
And what did we get?

20:12.894 --> 20:14.174
A thank you.

20:14.174 --> 20:15.654
Is that it?

20:15.654 --> 20:17.254
I think it does this
all the time, sir -

20:17.254 --> 20:20.814
misleads unsuspecting bribers
to get them to give money
to the medical fund.

20:20.814 --> 20:22.334
That's outrageous!

20:22.334 --> 20:25.054
Has it got no morals at all?

20:25.054 --> 20:28.614
It repeated that the only way
it could give you an absence
from duty note

20:28.614 --> 20:30.214
was if you are unwell

20:30.214 --> 20:33.574
or you'd taken a sabbatical to care
for an unwell member of the crew.

20:33.574 --> 20:35.254
Lister!

20:35.254 --> 20:37.494
Post-traumatic stress.
Missing the human race,

20:37.494 --> 20:40.934
dunking biscuits in the fish tank,
totally off the rails.

20:40.934 --> 20:44.374
Well, most of that could be dismissed
as eccentricity
rather than illness, sir.

20:44.374 --> 20:48.494
If you're going to use Mr Lister
in your defence,
I fear you need something more.

20:48.494 --> 20:49.774
Hmm.

20:49.774 --> 20:54.894
One act of saliva-dripping,
mouth-foaming insanity
by midnight tonight.

20:54.894 --> 20:56.654
Shouldn't be too hard.

21:00.454 --> 21:02.334
Hey, bud.

21:02.334 --> 21:04.134
Alphabet Head told me what happened.

21:04.134 --> 21:06.134
Come to check you out.

21:08.614 --> 21:11.134
So, who is this Roy dude?

21:11.134 --> 21:12.854
He used to work with her in the bank.

21:12.854 --> 21:16.694
He was always using
the finger-wetting machine
to count the money.

21:16.694 --> 21:18.374
Real creep.

21:18.374 --> 21:20.134
Could I give you a bit of advice?

21:20.134 --> 21:21.774
Don't think about them together.

21:21.774 --> 21:24.054
- Just move on.
- Right.

21:24.054 --> 21:28.094
Keep all those "them together"
thoughts right out of your head.

21:28.094 --> 21:29.774
Yeah, right.

21:29.774 --> 21:33.814
All the walking in the park, kissing
raindrops off her nose stuff -

21:33.814 --> 21:35.934
don't think about any of that.

21:35.934 --> 21:37.814
I used to love her nose.

21:37.814 --> 21:40.334
She used to squidge it up
when she told stories.

21:40.334 --> 21:43.214
And don't be tempted to wonder
if she squidged up her nose for him

21:43.214 --> 21:45.854
in that really cute way she used
to squidge up her nose for you,

21:45.854 --> 21:47.974
cos the chances are, she did.

21:49.094 --> 21:51.454
- You reckon?
- And another thing.

21:51.454 --> 21:55.254
Don't start thinking about all those
late-night shifts
she was always doing,

21:55.254 --> 21:57.534
because if it was me,
I'd be thinking, like, "Hey!

21:57.534 --> 21:59.854
"Banks all close at five."

22:01.214 --> 22:03.814
Yeah, she was always doing
late-night shifts.

22:03.814 --> 22:07.454
You know, supervising the delivery
of the unstealable pens.

22:07.454 --> 22:11.934
Or staying behind to help update
the bank queue waiting-pole rope.

22:13.574 --> 22:16.894
Or accidentally locking herself
in the vault for the whole weekend.

22:16.894 --> 22:18.334
She used to always do that.

22:19.934 --> 22:23.734
Hey, you don't think
she was with this Roy guy?

22:23.734 --> 22:26.254
The whole damn time.

22:27.294 --> 22:29.894
- It never even occurred to me.
- But the key is,

22:29.894 --> 22:31.814
don't think about it.

22:31.814 --> 22:33.654
I'm not thinking about it.

22:33.654 --> 22:36.294
- Think of something else.
- I'm thinking of something else!

22:36.294 --> 22:37.374
Good!

22:39.894 --> 22:43.134
Cos if you start thinking about all
those hours you were sitting at home,

22:43.134 --> 22:47.174
killing time, while she was probably
on all fours, covered in money...

22:48.894 --> 22:52.214
..while his finger-wetting machine
was working overtime...

22:55.894 --> 22:57.254
..it'll drive you crazy!

22:58.334 --> 23:01.894
Now, you get a picture like that
in your head,
it's real hard to get rid of.

23:05.014 --> 23:06.294
What you doing?

23:06.294 --> 23:07.614
What d'you think I'm doing?

23:07.614 --> 23:09.014
I told you not to think about it!

23:09.014 --> 23:11.334
I'm thinking about it now!

23:11.334 --> 23:12.894
That's unbelievable!

23:12.894 --> 23:14.974
You've not listened
to a word I've said.

23:22.214 --> 23:23.334
Still nothing, sir?

23:23.334 --> 23:27.294
You know, I'm starting to think
she never even wrote a second letter.

23:27.294 --> 23:29.494
Oh, sir, I know
this has stirred things up a bit,

23:29.494 --> 23:32.694
but I really believe
you've got to live in the present.

23:32.694 --> 23:34.974
You've got new friends now.

23:34.974 --> 23:39.574
True, they may not be human,
and some of them
are annoying and stupid and petty

23:39.574 --> 23:41.174
and maybe even insane,

23:41.174 --> 23:43.614
but that doesn't mean
they're any less precious.

23:43.614 --> 23:48.054
You've got to forget about the past
and look after the present.

23:54.214 --> 23:55.734
Hiya.

23:55.734 --> 23:57.014
'Oh, it's you.

23:57.014 --> 23:58.334
'This is awkward.'

23:58.334 --> 24:00.054
Look, I'm sorry about before.

24:00.054 --> 24:02.734
I just wanna know if there's any way
I can make it up to you.

24:02.734 --> 24:04.494
- 'Really?'
- Yep.

24:04.494 --> 24:06.414
'Oh, Dave!

24:06.414 --> 24:08.534
'I don't know why we fight like this.

24:08.534 --> 24:10.414
'We're so silly!

24:10.414 --> 24:11.894
So what's it to be, then?

24:11.894 --> 24:14.174
New paint job, new nozzle housings?

24:14.174 --> 24:15.734
How about a restock?

24:15.734 --> 24:18.774
- 'Anything?'
- Anythin'. You name it.

24:18.774 --> 24:22.654
'Well, if I could have anything,
absolutely anything,

24:22.654 --> 24:24.254
'I've always wanted...

24:24.254 --> 24:26.574
'to see around the corner.'

24:26.574 --> 24:28.814
What, down there round the corner?

24:28.814 --> 24:30.654
'Oh, I know it's crazy,

24:30.654 --> 24:33.294
'but it's always been
a wild dream of mine.

24:33.294 --> 24:35.894
'I've heard stories,
but to actually see it myself...

24:41.334 --> 24:44.014
'I can't believe I'm actually going!

24:44.014 --> 24:46.134
- 'Isn't this romantic?'
- Well...

24:46.134 --> 24:48.574
don't build your hopes up too much.

24:48.574 --> 24:51.214
It might not be as great
as you think.

24:51.214 --> 24:52.254
Da-daaaan!

24:53.574 --> 24:55.774
- Well?
- 'Oh! Ohhh!

24:55.774 --> 24:59.054
'It's everything
I thought it was and more.

24:59.054 --> 25:01.574
'Oh! Oh, Dave.

25:01.574 --> 25:03.454
'Maybe we could stay here.

25:03.454 --> 25:04.854
'You and me.

25:04.854 --> 25:07.054
'I know it's...crazy,

25:07.054 --> 25:09.374
'but we could settle down here.

25:09.374 --> 25:11.814
'Hm? Start a new life!

25:11.814 --> 25:14.254
'Oh, put me back there by the wall.

25:15.774 --> 25:17.774
'Oh!

25:17.774 --> 25:20.414
- 'Oh, Dave!'
- Smeg, sorry!

25:20.414 --> 25:23.174
'I knew you'd come round,
you naughty boy!

25:23.174 --> 25:25.014
'Rrrrar!'

25:25.014 --> 25:26.934
I'll get you up.

25:26.934 --> 25:28.814
'Oh! Dave!

25:28.814 --> 25:31.614
'Dave! Naughty boy!

25:31.614 --> 25:33.014
'Wow!

25:33.014 --> 25:35.294
'I have never seen a ceiling.'

25:47.174 --> 25:49.334
Rimmsy, Rimmsy, Rimmsy!

25:49.334 --> 25:51.814
Oh, yes! CCTV!

25:51.814 --> 25:54.134
Sabbatical note, here we come!

25:57.974 --> 25:59.894
What would you have me do
with these, sir?

25:59.894 --> 26:00.894
Ohh.

26:03.454 --> 26:04.814
What did I tell you, sir?

26:04.814 --> 26:08.694
I knew you'd find another species
to settle down with!

26:10.374 --> 26:11.814
I'm just tryin' to pick her up.

26:11.814 --> 26:14.094
Looks like you're well past
that stage to me, sir.

26:22.334 --> 26:25.694
Damn paper!
There's gotta be some somewhere.

26:25.694 --> 26:27.294
Ahh!

26:27.294 --> 26:29.734
Ooh! Guhh!

26:30.934 --> 26:33.414
Damn near walked three miles!

26:33.414 --> 26:35.174
Hey...

26:35.174 --> 26:36.334
Uhhh!

26:38.214 --> 26:39.734
Hee-hee-hee-hee!

26:41.054 --> 26:42.214
Oh!

26:43.854 --> 26:46.254
That's every letter checked, sir.
It wasn't there.

26:46.254 --> 26:48.534
Oh, well. Thanks, Krytes.

26:48.534 --> 26:52.014
Never mind, third technician!

26:53.094 --> 26:56.094
Three decks, not one single roll!

26:56.094 --> 26:57.534
Hey, that's mine.

26:57.534 --> 26:59.014
The hell it is. I found it.

26:59.014 --> 27:00.854
I need it.

27:00.854 --> 27:03.774
- Give it here!
- I need to wipe!

27:03.774 --> 27:06.494
You see what you guys
have done to us?

27:06.494 --> 27:08.014
This is madness!

27:08.014 --> 27:09.734
Madness!

27:09.734 --> 27:11.534
That's my special report!

27:11.534 --> 27:13.614
It won't be special in a minute.

27:21.174 --> 27:23.174
I've realised now this might be it.

27:23.174 --> 27:25.974
This might be the answer
as to why I feel so empty.

27:25.974 --> 27:29.734
I mean, if she had my kids,
that means my kids
might have had kids.

27:29.734 --> 27:32.534
There might be hundreds
of generations spawned by me.

27:32.534 --> 27:34.374
I might have had a daughter
who was a doctor

27:34.374 --> 27:37.934
or a great-great-great-great-great-
great-great-great-great-grandson

27:37.934 --> 27:39.734
who was a zero-gee football star.

27:40.894 --> 27:42.694
No matter what happens to me now,

27:42.694 --> 27:45.254
I feel like I've contributed.

27:45.254 --> 27:47.214
I am someone.

27:49.094 --> 27:53.374
Man, I hope it's mine,
because I know, with her as a mother,
they would have been

27:53.374 --> 27:57.654
the best kids
they could possibly be, cos I mean,
she was a wonderful woman,

27:57.654 --> 28:00.734
and I'm sure she'd have been
an even more wonderful mother.

28:01.854 --> 28:03.174
Wish me luck.

28:11.174 --> 28:12.654
What an absolute slag.
