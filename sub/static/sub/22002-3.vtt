WEBVTT

00:00.219 --> 00:02.404
Okay, we're all set up in there,
Mr. Peralta.

00:02.406 --> 00:03.468
Just sign here.

00:03.523 --> 00:05.058
What's all set up? What's going on?

00:05.092 --> 00:06.793
Ah, thank you for asking, Terrence.

00:06.827 --> 00:09.919
You see, the food in
prison was inedible.

00:09.922 --> 00:11.781
All I thought about day and night

00:11.783 --> 00:13.234
were the things I wished I was eating.

00:13.236 --> 00:14.732
And you, Amy. I thought about you a lot.

00:14.734 --> 00:17.428
Sex with you, just, us
doing sex with foreplay.

00:17.514 --> 00:19.416
Great save, babe. Thanks.

00:19.450 --> 00:21.427
And so I decided to make
my food fantasy come true.

00:21.451 --> 00:23.787
Unbutton your pants and
take off your shoes,

00:23.820 --> 00:26.758
'cause there's gonna be
a doinkload of sodium

00:26.790 --> 00:29.394
at Freedom Feast 2017.

00:29.427 --> 00:31.462
We begin where all great stories begin.

00:31.496 --> 00:34.099
In the quaint little town
of French Fry Village.

00:34.132 --> 00:36.468
After that, we're gonna
move our adventure over

00:36.501 --> 00:38.370
to Cheeseburger Mountain,

00:38.402 --> 00:40.571
which consists... you guessed it...
of turkey burgers.

00:40.605 --> 00:42.474
I'm kidding, it's cheeseburgers.

00:42.507 --> 00:44.450
This is kind of just stuffing.
You can avoid that.

00:44.474 --> 00:47.145
But it's attached to the
Thanksgiving turkey theme

00:47.178 --> 00:48.856
'cause I was thinking about
that a lot up in the jail.

00:48.880 --> 00:51.715
And finally, we have a
big old Passover brisket

00:51.749 --> 00:53.389
'cause you know I loves my mom.

00:53.452 --> 00:56.589
If you would all take a
seat while I make a toast.

00:56.622 --> 00:59.325
Kindly raise your two liters.

00:59.358 --> 01:02.361
To freedom, to you,
and most importantly,

01:02.394 --> 01:03.763
to orange drank.

01:03.796 --> 01:04.964
And sex with Amy.

01:04.995 --> 01:06.632
To sex with Amy!

01:06.665 --> 01:08.282
Sorry. Shouldn't have
said that last part.

01:28.320 --> 01:29.388
Oink, oink.

01:29.421 --> 01:30.690
Good morning, sir.

01:30.722 --> 01:32.657
Your expression is
inscrutable as always.

01:32.690 --> 01:34.326
And yours is extremely scrutable.

01:34.359 --> 01:35.760
You want something.

01:35.793 --> 01:37.230
A video game, perhaps?

01:37.263 --> 01:38.431
Or a fidget spinner?

01:38.463 --> 01:39.573
I do want both of those things,

01:39.597 --> 01:41.534
but that's not why I'm here.

01:41.567 --> 01:43.344
I'm back and I'm ready for a
case, so what do you got?

01:43.368 --> 01:45.470
A murder? A sui? A murder-sui?

01:45.504 --> 01:47.373
They often follow one another.

01:47.406 --> 01:48.984
Ooh, maybe you've got an
avunculicide up in there?

01:49.008 --> 01:50.643
The murder of an uncle.

01:50.675 --> 01:52.410
I'm surprised you know
what that word means.

01:52.443 --> 01:54.312
I learned about a lot of
new crimes in prison.

01:54.345 --> 01:55.648
Those people real bad.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.315
You know you can't work a case yet.

01:57.349 --> 01:59.285
You've been assigned to desk duty.

01:59.317 --> 02:00.462
Oh, please. Don't make me
sit behind a desk all day.

02:00.486 --> 02:01.686
That's worse than prison.

02:01.719 --> 02:03.522
No, it's not. Prison real bad.

02:03.555 --> 02:04.633
Those are the rules for
anyone experiencing

02:04.657 --> 02:05.758
a traumatic work-lapse.

02:05.790 --> 02:07.326
It wasn't that traumatic.

02:07.358 --> 02:08.660
You just said, and I quote,

02:08.693 --> 02:10.429
"Prison real bad."

02:10.461 --> 02:12.264
Look, I'm ready. I'm the same old Jake.

02:12.298 --> 02:13.340
I don't know why you
have an issue with this.

02:13.364 --> 02:14.666
Rosa was happy to comply.

02:14.699 --> 02:15.844
So, what, now I'm just supposed

02:15.868 --> 02:17.603
to do anything that Rosa does?

02:17.636 --> 02:19.272
I mean, what if she jumped off a cliff?

02:19.304 --> 02:20.739
If Rosa were to jump off a cliff,

02:20.773 --> 02:22.574
she would've done her
due diligence regarding

02:22.607 --> 02:24.052
the height of the cliff,
the depth of the water,

02:24.076 --> 02:25.678
and the angle of entry, so... yes.

02:25.710 --> 02:27.488
If you see Rosa jump off
a cliff, by all means.

02:27.512 --> 02:28.813
Jump off a cliff.

02:28.846 --> 02:29.814
You jump off a cliff.

02:29.847 --> 02:31.049
Gladly.

02:31.083 --> 02:33.352
Provided Rosa did first.

02:33.385 --> 02:34.453
Hey. Babe.

02:34.486 --> 02:35.821
You forgot your lunch at home.

02:35.853 --> 02:37.756
Aww, thanks Adrian. You're the sweetest.

02:37.790 --> 02:39.625
Aww, of course.

02:39.657 --> 02:41.369
I French kissed every slice
of meat in that sandwich.

02:41.393 --> 02:42.528
Pimento, welcome back.

02:42.560 --> 02:43.796
How was Argentina?

02:43.828 --> 02:45.498
Eh, it was kind of boring, actually.

02:45.530 --> 02:47.332
Although, one funny
thing did happen to me.

02:52.671 --> 02:54.440
Still feels like you and I

02:54.472 --> 02:56.383
have a different idea about
what a funny thing is.

02:56.407 --> 02:57.776
Right? Anyway. I should boogie.

02:57.810 --> 02:59.478
What? Say good-bye to mommy.

02:59.511 --> 03:01.347
Ooh, don't mind if I do.

03:01.380 --> 03:03.882
All right, I'm just
gonna look over here.

03:03.916 --> 03:05.851
- Okay. I'm doing that thing.
- Man.

03:05.883 --> 03:07.561
- I think it's still happening.
- I'm still hearing it.

03:07.585 --> 03:09.387
Phew!

03:09.421 --> 03:11.532
Hang on. Were you creeps
watching that the whole time?

03:11.556 --> 03:12.792
- Well...
- Uh...

03:12.824 --> 03:14.560
I'm just kidding. I know you were.

03:14.592 --> 03:16.404
It's like an eclipse. You
should always look at it

03:16.428 --> 03:19.431
with both eyes wide open. Full on.
You're welcome.

03:19.465 --> 03:20.633
I love you, babe.

03:20.666 --> 03:22.101
- Love you too.
- Yeah!

03:22.133 --> 03:24.436
Must be so nice having Pimento back.

03:24.470 --> 03:25.880
I mean, you shouldn't eat that sandwich.

03:25.904 --> 03:27.673
Something's wrong. He's acting weird...

03:27.705 --> 03:28.874
- Er than normal?
- Yes.

03:28.906 --> 03:30.675
He's not telling me something.

03:30.709 --> 03:31.886
You guys did spend several months apart.

03:31.910 --> 03:33.379
Maybe it's all in your head.

03:33.411 --> 03:34.813
Oh. Bitches be crazy,

03:34.846 --> 03:35.889
is that what you're saying, Terry?

03:35.913 --> 03:38.117
What? No, no.

03:38.149 --> 03:40.518
I did not say that. I
would never say that.

03:40.552 --> 03:41.686
Not cool, Terry.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.689
My relationship's in trouble.

03:43.721 --> 03:45.457
Terry loves women!

03:45.490 --> 03:47.493
Women be sane!

03:49.727 --> 03:52.498
Welcome to the first day
of the rest of your life,

03:52.530 --> 03:53.531
desk brother.

03:53.565 --> 03:54.667
I don't think so.

03:54.699 --> 03:55.701
This is just temporary.

03:55.733 --> 03:57.435
That's what I said.

03:57.469 --> 03:59.405
Join us, Jake.

03:59.437 --> 04:01.440
You know you want to.

04:01.472 --> 04:04.542
We're going to Wingsluts.

04:04.576 --> 04:06.579
My God. Charles!

04:06.612 --> 04:07.912
Charles, Charles, Charles!

04:07.946 --> 04:09.382
What's wrong?

04:09.415 --> 04:10.715
Going crazy over here, man.

04:10.749 --> 04:12.550
The only worthwhile
thing I've done today

04:12.584 --> 04:13.762
was take a Buzzfeed quiz about
what kind of onion I am.

04:13.786 --> 04:16.488
Hm. Vidalia.

04:16.522 --> 04:17.723
Ah. Cipollini.

04:17.755 --> 04:19.423
That was not the point of my story.

04:19.457 --> 04:20.635
- Oh.
- Desk duty is a nightmare.

04:20.659 --> 04:21.736
Name one thing someone accomplished

04:21.760 --> 04:23.428
while sitting behind a desk.

04:23.461 --> 04:25.130
Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery.

04:25.163 --> 04:26.740
Yeah, but think about how much
faster he would've done it

04:26.764 --> 04:28.510
if he'd got off his ass
once in a while, right?

04:28.534 --> 04:29.911
Well, just tell me what
you're working on, huh?

04:29.935 --> 04:31.870
Before the stapling starts
again, please? Please?

04:31.904 --> 04:33.615
- I don't know if I should.
- Charles, Charles, Charles!

04:33.639 --> 04:35.541
I need this, man. Just
give me a little taste.

04:36.675 --> 04:37.977
- Grand larceny.
- No!

04:38.010 --> 04:39.545
- Ow!
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!

04:39.577 --> 04:40.912
I just... I love grand larceny.

04:40.945 --> 04:42.514
I know. I didn't wanna bring it up.

04:42.548 --> 04:43.882
It'll never happen again, just...

04:43.916 --> 04:45.483
Who got robbed?

04:45.517 --> 04:46.827
- Sneaker store.
- I hope you die!

04:46.851 --> 04:48.486
- Ah!
- Oh! That was way too harsh.

04:48.519 --> 04:49.954
Charles, forgive me.

04:49.988 --> 04:51.498
This is crazy, right?
It doesn't seem fair.

04:51.522 --> 04:52.490
I should be working this case.

04:52.524 --> 04:53.492
Yeah.

04:53.524 --> 04:54.692
I will work this case.

04:54.726 --> 04:55.769
There's gotta be a way to fix it.

04:55.793 --> 04:56.961
and I'm gonna figure it out.

04:56.995 --> 04:58.430
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

04:58.464 --> 04:59.899
Yeah!

04:59.932 --> 05:01.608
Wow, throwing your file all
over the place, Charles?

05:01.632 --> 05:02.601
- Really immature.
- Yeah, you're right.

05:02.634 --> 05:03.936
I'll go clean it up.

05:03.969 --> 05:05.838
Well, figured out what's
off with Pimento.

05:05.870 --> 05:07.173
He's cheating on me.

05:07.206 --> 05:08.741
- No.
- Oh, Rosa.

05:08.774 --> 05:10.643
I found his credit card statement.

05:10.675 --> 05:12.519
There's a charge for a
restaurant called La Palapa.

05:12.543 --> 05:14.947
Two entrees. One flan.

05:14.979 --> 05:16.781
- One flan?
- One flan.

05:16.815 --> 05:17.916
- That's cold.
- Yeah.

05:17.949 --> 05:19.584
Cold.

05:19.618 --> 05:20.719
I'm so confused.

05:20.752 --> 05:21.787
They shared the flan!

05:21.820 --> 05:23.522
Okay, but...

05:23.555 --> 05:24.765
That seems like a bit of a stretch.

05:24.789 --> 05:26.591
Nope. When it comes to cheating,

05:26.625 --> 05:28.627
you gotta pay attention
to all the signs.

05:28.659 --> 05:29.961
During my year abroad in Japan,

05:29.995 --> 05:31.564
I learned that the hard way.

05:31.596 --> 05:32.664
Chiaki...

05:42.940 --> 05:45.243
There was no Japanese tea sock.

05:45.276 --> 05:46.846
But there was a Japanese man.

05:46.878 --> 05:48.680
I wasted a year on Chiaki.

05:48.714 --> 05:50.014
So, what should I do?

05:50.048 --> 05:51.226
Maybe don't jump to conclusions.

05:51.250 --> 05:52.651
No! Interrogate him!

05:52.683 --> 05:54.619
Follow the flan, Rosa.

05:54.652 --> 05:55.854
Follow the flan.

05:55.887 --> 05:56.955
Right.

05:56.988 --> 05:58.690
Follow the flan.

05:58.724 --> 06:00.860
Guess what I'm holding behind my back?

06:00.892 --> 06:02.695
Before we begin,

06:02.728 --> 06:04.562
what are the parameters
of the guessing game?

06:04.596 --> 06:05.807
How many guesses do I get?
Is there a time limit?

06:05.831 --> 06:07.533
Forget it. You ruin everything.

06:07.565 --> 06:08.642
It's the police code and ethics manual.

06:08.666 --> 06:09.969
Chapter four. Page 83.

06:10.002 --> 06:11.269
You should not have told me.

06:11.303 --> 06:12.704
I never would've guessed it.

06:12.738 --> 06:14.038
Now I've won.

06:14.072 --> 06:15.875
This. This is what I've missed.

06:15.908 --> 06:18.244
It clearly states that I can
get off of desk duty if

06:18.276 --> 06:20.245
I pass a field evaluation
performed by a member

06:20.279 --> 06:22.581
of the Municipal Police
Training Council.

06:22.613 --> 06:24.616
That's right. It's a loophole.

06:24.649 --> 06:25.750
Loophole high five.

06:25.784 --> 06:27.086
- Loop...
- Hole.

06:27.118 --> 06:29.721
- Loop...
- Hole!

06:29.755 --> 06:31.099
Enough. This is highly inappropriate.

06:31.123 --> 06:32.992
Did you also see where it states,

06:33.024 --> 06:35.995
"If you fail the evaluation,
you will be suspended"?

06:36.027 --> 06:37.604
I would have to take your gun and badge.

06:37.628 --> 06:39.097
I'm not worried about that.

06:39.130 --> 06:40.841
I swear to my personal Lord
and Savior, Steph Curry,

06:40.865 --> 06:42.300
I'm ready.

06:42.334 --> 06:44.303
I think you're rushing. It's a bad idea.

06:44.336 --> 06:46.705
Doesn't matter. I'm allowed
to demand my own evaluation.

06:46.738 --> 06:48.115
Yes, but as your commanding officer,

06:48.139 --> 06:51.543
I choose the evaluator. And I choose...

06:51.577 --> 06:52.545
Me.

06:52.577 --> 06:53.845
Wait. What?

06:53.878 --> 06:55.748
I'm a qualified member of the MPTC.

06:55.781 --> 06:56.749
I'll administer it.

06:56.781 --> 06:58.550
All right. Fine.

06:58.584 --> 06:59.851
I'll pass your dumb evaluation

06:59.885 --> 07:01.654
and crack this case. Bring it on.

07:01.687 --> 07:03.022
- I will.
- Good.

07:03.055 --> 07:05.057
- Good.
- You're good. But I'm better.

07:05.089 --> 07:06.767
And I'm gonna ace this thing
before you can even...

07:06.791 --> 07:07.901
Oh, wait, wait, what
are you writing down?

07:07.925 --> 07:09.327
Sir? What are you writing down?

07:09.361 --> 07:11.029
Charles... What's he writing?

07:11.062 --> 07:13.031
- Write something good.
- Write something good.

07:13.065 --> 07:15.601
We're just gonna leave.
Just stop writing.

07:15.634 --> 07:16.810
- Just stop writing.
- Stop writing.

07:16.834 --> 07:18.036
- Unless it's good.
- No.

07:18.070 --> 07:19.079
- Is it good?
- Is it good?

07:19.103 --> 07:20.305
We're gonna go. Sir?

07:20.339 --> 07:21.339
Write something good.

07:21.373 --> 07:22.642
Write something good.

07:24.719 --> 07:26.519
It looks like the perp
knew what he was after.

07:26.562 --> 07:28.173
All he took was a shipment
of thousand dollar

07:28.197 --> 07:31.576
limited edition Weezies
designed by Little Wayne.

07:31.578 --> 07:32.913
Oh, it's Lil.

07:32.946 --> 07:34.114
- Oh, like Lillian.
- No.

07:34.146 --> 07:35.516
Lillian Wayne. Okay.

07:35.549 --> 07:36.601
Okay.

07:36.603 --> 07:39.986
Captain, I hope you're wearing
your evaluating pants,

07:40.020 --> 07:41.297
'cause I'm about to put on
a crime solving clinic.

07:41.321 --> 07:42.989
I am wearing my evaluating pants.

07:43.023 --> 07:44.258
What? 'Cause I was just...

07:44.290 --> 07:46.026
Wait, what are evaluating pants?

07:46.059 --> 07:47.602
They have a deep bottom
pocket for my notepad,

07:47.626 --> 07:50.030
and they don't crease, which is a must,

07:50.062 --> 07:52.265
given how much I squat
during an evaluation.

07:52.299 --> 07:55.102
Mmkay, well there were no
witnesses to the crime,

07:55.134 --> 07:57.045
which is weird since there was
a long line of sneaker-heads

07:57.069 --> 07:59.014
right outside the window, and
you're actually squatting.

07:59.038 --> 08:00.273
Just, uh, ignore me.

08:00.307 --> 08:02.242
Unless you can't.

08:02.275 --> 08:04.144
It's not a problem. I love ignoring you.

08:04.177 --> 08:05.655
Don't write that down. But
continuing with the case,

08:05.679 --> 08:07.023
There were no signs of forced entry.

08:07.047 --> 08:08.248
- Hm.
- No fingerprints.

08:08.280 --> 08:09.917
- Hmm.
- And no DNA evidence.

08:09.949 --> 08:11.160
- Hmm.
- Okay, I can't ignore you.

08:11.184 --> 08:12.886
What are you writing down there?

08:12.918 --> 08:14.163
Probably that you're crushing it, Jake,

08:14.187 --> 08:15.321
because you are crushing it.

08:15.355 --> 08:17.023
Are you trying to squat a peek?

08:17.057 --> 08:18.592
Of course I'm trying to squat a peek,

08:18.624 --> 08:20.560
but I also might be solving the case.

08:20.593 --> 08:22.071
Charles, come take a look at this...
there's a security camera

08:22.095 --> 08:23.931
across the street we didn't see before.

08:23.963 --> 08:25.965
I have a feeling our answers
are in that footage.

08:25.999 --> 08:27.568
Squat five.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.101
- Too far.
- I'll move closer.

08:29.134 --> 08:31.137
- Still too far.
- A little closer.

08:31.170 --> 08:32.573
- Getting closer.
- There we go.

08:35.375 --> 08:36.644
Worth it.

08:38.243 --> 08:40.111
I followed the flan.

08:40.145 --> 08:42.058
I confronted Pimento about
La Palapa and he lied to me.

08:42.082 --> 08:44.183
_

08:44.217 --> 08:46.094
He denied ever even hearing
about the restaurant.

08:46.118 --> 08:47.987
- Hmm, that is strange.
- And this morning,

08:48.021 --> 08:49.589
he left the house in clean clothes.

08:49.622 --> 08:51.023
- He never does that.
- Never?

08:51.056 --> 08:52.325
You need to follow him.

08:52.358 --> 08:53.769
Catch him with his spoon in the flan.

08:53.793 --> 08:55.662
That's exactly what I was thinking.

08:55.694 --> 08:57.138
I need to check out a
full surveillance kit.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.364
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:58.397 --> 09:00.300
That's against the rules. Sarge?

09:00.333 --> 09:02.368
There are no rules when it
comes to cheating, Amy.

09:02.401 --> 09:04.070
I totally agree.

09:04.103 --> 09:05.939
But unfortunately, the NYPD does not.

09:05.972 --> 09:08.141
I can't lend you department
equipment for personal use.

09:08.174 --> 09:10.376
But there may be a work-around.
Hitchcock!

09:10.410 --> 09:12.646
You have any surveillance
equipment Rosa can borrow?

09:12.679 --> 09:14.280
You mean my creep kit?

09:14.314 --> 09:16.650
No prob. Got another one in the car.

09:16.683 --> 09:19.053
See, Amy? That's what a
real friend looks like.

09:20.420 --> 09:22.689
Okay. Security footage came in.

09:22.722 --> 09:24.658
Let's see what we got.

09:24.690 --> 09:26.292
Probably a huge break.

09:26.325 --> 09:28.036
Well, let's not put too much
pressure on it.

09:28.060 --> 09:29.795
You're right. It's probably a dead end.

09:29.828 --> 09:31.140
- Also not helpful.
- Let's just watch the footage.

09:31.164 --> 09:32.766
Yes. Great. All right, so,

09:32.799 --> 09:35.068
here we have the camped-out
line of sneaker-heads.

09:35.101 --> 09:36.378
Not much going on around midnight.

09:36.402 --> 09:38.004
- Let's just fast-forward.
- It's okay.

09:38.037 --> 09:39.381
Still pretty calm at around 1:00 a.m.

09:39.405 --> 09:41.274
- That's all right.
- Fast forward.

09:41.306 --> 09:43.051
And also looking a little
bit slow around 3:00 a.m.

09:43.075 --> 09:45.745
So, basically it shows nothing.

09:45.779 --> 09:47.681
Or...

09:47.713 --> 09:49.116
Does it show everything?

09:49.149 --> 09:50.717
Ooh!

09:50.750 --> 09:52.653
Sorry not sorry. It was
just a stupid pencil.

09:52.685 --> 09:54.286
It was a gift from my deceased father.

09:54.319 --> 09:56.355
A pencil? Your dad
gave pretty bad gifts.

09:58.190 --> 09:59.702
Although on the other hand,
all my dad ever gave me

09:59.726 --> 10:01.170
was abandonment issues,
so, potato-tomato.

10:01.194 --> 10:03.163
But look at this. Right
around 4:00 a.m.,

10:03.195 --> 10:04.665
the line moves down.

10:04.698 --> 10:07.199
Everyone except for that blue pup tent,

10:07.232 --> 10:09.102
which is interesting.

10:09.135 --> 10:10.804
Oh, my boy's got a hunch.

10:10.837 --> 10:12.304
He's got bunches of hunches.

10:12.338 --> 10:14.107
I think they didn't move down

10:14.140 --> 10:15.284
because they didn't care
about their place in line.

10:15.308 --> 10:17.010
I believe all they cared about

10:17.043 --> 10:19.446
was the placement of
their tent, which was...

10:19.478 --> 10:22.782
Right over this manhole cover.

10:22.815 --> 10:26.118
And I wonder what's behind this.

10:26.151 --> 10:27.453
Hayouken!

10:27.487 --> 10:29.155
Oh, look.

10:29.189 --> 10:30.790
It's the sneaker store stock room.

10:30.824 --> 10:33.093
Whoa. How does he do it, folks?

10:33.126 --> 10:34.428
It was a team effort, Boyle.

10:34.460 --> 10:35.861
- Humble five?
- You know it.

10:35.895 --> 10:37.798
Uh, I couldn't possibly.

10:37.830 --> 10:39.298
Of course we still have no idea

10:39.332 --> 10:40.801
who was in the blue pup tent.

10:40.833 --> 10:42.343
You know what? There is no pleasing you.

10:42.367 --> 10:44.170
That is accurate.

10:45.804 --> 10:48.141
What do you want?

10:48.174 --> 10:49.376
<i>- Hey.
- Hi, Rosa.</i>

10:49.409 --> 10:51.211
How's the Pimento stake out going?

10:51.243 --> 10:53.045
<i>Has he done anything suspicious yet?</i>

10:53.078 --> 10:54.814
No. Just regular Pimento stuff.

11:00.753 --> 11:02.321
Ugh. It's like he's going all norm-core

11:02.354 --> 11:04.156
to through me off the scent.

11:04.189 --> 11:06.392
Or maybe it could be Pimento
wasn't cheating on you.

11:06.425 --> 11:08.261
What? You sound like a
real Amy right now.

11:08.294 --> 11:09.862
- Hey.
- I know,

11:09.896 --> 11:11.865
but even a broken Amy can
be right twice a day.

11:11.897 --> 11:13.733
Hey!

11:13.766 --> 11:15.810
We went to lunch at La Palapa
and we shared the flan.

11:15.834 --> 11:17.103
Oh, so you two are boning now?

11:17.136 --> 11:18.371
No!

11:18.404 --> 11:20.340
The flan's huge. Everyone shares it.

11:20.372 --> 11:22.309
- The restaurant tells you to.
- Hmm.

11:22.342 --> 11:24.511
<i>Maybe it's time to put the
creep kit away, Rosa.</i>

11:24.544 --> 11:26.213
Wait.

11:26.246 --> 11:27.323
Pimento just walked up to a woman.

11:27.347 --> 11:28.482
A female woman?

11:28.515 --> 11:31.451
<i>Rosa, is it a female woman?</i>

11:31.483 --> 11:32.451
They just kissed.

11:32.484 --> 11:33.819
Oh, no.

11:33.852 --> 11:35.287
I'm so sorry, Rosa.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.388
<i>Whatever.</i>

11:36.421 --> 11:38.324
Hope you enjoyed the flan.

11:38.357 --> 11:41.795
So, what's this about a giant flan?

11:41.828 --> 11:44.331
The manager at the store
recognized the pup tent

11:44.363 --> 11:46.365
from two previous sneaker launches.

11:46.399 --> 11:49.269
And he ID'd the owner
as one Morris Richman.

11:49.301 --> 11:52.338
Who just so happens to work for Con Ed,

11:52.372 --> 11:54.174
on underground electrical wires.

11:54.207 --> 11:58.245
He also just so happens
to live a-right a-here.

11:59.978 --> 12:01.881
You might wanna squat for this, Mr.
Evaluator.

12:01.915 --> 12:04.450
I decide when the
squatting is necessary.

12:08.854 --> 12:10.122
This was my choice.

12:10.155 --> 12:12.324
Can I help you?

12:12.357 --> 12:13.492
Are you Morris Richman?

12:13.526 --> 12:14.895
- Yes.
- And are those

12:14.928 --> 12:15.962
Weezies?

12:15.995 --> 12:17.497
Yes.

12:17.530 --> 12:19.299
- Well done, Peralta.
- Thank you.

12:19.332 --> 12:22.402
But it wasn't me. It was Steph...

12:22.434 --> 12:24.470
Working through me.

12:24.503 --> 12:26.205
What is going on?

12:26.238 --> 12:27.840
Oh, he's been evaluating me.

12:27.873 --> 12:29.418
It's been up and down,
but this is a clear win.

12:29.442 --> 12:31.211
Oh, sorry, you mean
what's going on with you?

12:31.243 --> 12:32.812
You're under arrest for grand larceny.

12:32.846 --> 12:34.147
I didn't do anything.

12:34.179 --> 12:36.248
Is this about the Weezies?

12:36.281 --> 12:37.550
A friend gave them to me.

12:37.583 --> 12:39.920
I'm innocent. Come on,
man, I'm innocent.

12:39.953 --> 12:41.387
Sure you are, buddy.

12:41.420 --> 12:43.523
We all know you did it.

12:47.926 --> 12:49.995
Charles!

12:50.029 --> 12:52.165
- We arrested the wrong guy.
- What?

12:52.198 --> 12:54.518
Morris Richman didn't do it.
We have to fix this right now.

12:56.202 --> 12:57.562
I'll wait for you to not be naked.

12:57.768 --> 12:59.283
This is really bad, Charles.

12:59.285 --> 13:01.516
Jake, can you please
spiral a little quieter?

13:01.518 --> 13:03.321
Nikolaj is still asleep

13:03.354 --> 13:04.630
and if he hears two men
arguing in the next room,

13:04.654 --> 13:06.289
he might think he's getting sold again.

13:06.322 --> 13:07.924
Aww, man, his backstory is so sad.

13:07.957 --> 13:09.459
- I know.
- Look.

13:09.493 --> 13:11.262
I don't know how I
screwed this up, I mean,

13:11.295 --> 13:13.239
maybe Holt got in my head
with all of his squatting.

13:13.263 --> 13:14.574
- It was a powerful image.
- I think I rushed this all

13:14.598 --> 13:16.334
so I could pass the evaluation.
Bottom line,

13:16.367 --> 13:17.435
we arrested the wrong guy.

13:17.468 --> 13:19.003
What about the pup tent?

13:19.036 --> 13:20.714
And the manhole? And he
was wearing Weezies.

13:20.738 --> 13:22.514
Maybe his friend gave them
to him just like he said.

13:22.538 --> 13:23.941
We have no physical evidence

13:23.974 --> 13:25.443
tying him to the stock room.

13:25.475 --> 13:26.619
Plus, where are the
rest of the sneakers?

13:26.643 --> 13:28.012
Okay. So,

13:28.045 --> 13:29.614
do we tell Captain Holt?

13:29.647 --> 13:31.390
No. Then he'll fail me
and I'll get suspended.

13:31.414 --> 13:33.250
We gotta solve this on our own.

13:33.283 --> 13:36.354
And I think I know how. I
found a lead on the dark web.

13:36.387 --> 13:38.256
Nice. The dark web.

13:38.288 --> 13:39.733
It's the only place you
can buy quality bat meat.

13:39.757 --> 13:42.393
Mm. Gross. Anyways, I posted a message

13:42.426 --> 13:45.263
looking for Weezies and I got
pointed to MizzBK-Sneaks.

13:45.296 --> 13:46.696
She put this pic up yesterday.

13:46.729 --> 13:48.599
Ah. Those are our stolen shoes.

13:48.632 --> 13:50.034
But who's MizzBK-Sneaks?

13:50.066 --> 13:51.969
Her name is Jenny McFadden.

13:52.002 --> 13:54.346
She moves her merch out of the
back of a bodega on Willoughby.

13:54.370 --> 13:55.981
Cool, cool, cool, cool.
All right, one problem.

13:56.005 --> 13:57.683
If we go to the bodega
looking like detectives,

13:57.707 --> 13:59.009
we'll spook her.

13:59.042 --> 14:00.411
Right you are, Charles my chum.

14:00.444 --> 14:01.553
But we won't look like detectives.

14:01.577 --> 14:03.648
I brought all my best sneakers.

14:03.681 --> 14:05.549
Get your fat, sweaty feet ready.

14:05.581 --> 14:06.984
Yeah.

14:07.017 --> 14:08.986
We're gonna look flippity-dippity-fly.

14:09.018 --> 14:11.489
Hey. So, you doing okay?

14:12.556 --> 14:14.292
Not really.

14:14.325 --> 14:15.534
I waited outside that
restaurant for two hours

14:15.558 --> 14:16.693
and he never came out.

14:16.726 --> 14:17.694
Cantaloupe?

14:17.728 --> 14:18.763
I'm good. Amy?

14:18.796 --> 14:20.498
Also good. Also good.

14:20.531 --> 14:22.300
I spent the whole night riding my bike,

14:22.332 --> 14:24.334
just thinking and riding,
riding and thinking.

14:24.368 --> 14:25.744
Also, I drank some
water from the stream.

14:25.768 --> 14:27.672
And what did you figure out?

14:27.705 --> 14:29.416
I'm gonna dump his ass. He
should be here any minute.

14:29.440 --> 14:30.683
Oh, you're gonna do it at work.
That's great.

14:30.707 --> 14:32.442
There you are.

14:32.475 --> 14:33.585
Babe, I've been looking
for you all night.

14:33.609 --> 14:35.479
You didn't come home.

14:35.512 --> 14:37.056
'Cause I knew if I did, I
would stab you in the face.

14:37.080 --> 14:39.417
Oh, Terry, we have the
thing in the other room.

14:39.450 --> 14:41.018
- Mm-hmm.
- Phone...

14:41.051 --> 14:43.054
Yeah. Meeting. Uh, work.
Friend lunch. Yep.

14:43.086 --> 14:46.456
So is this a sexy stab in the face?

14:46.489 --> 14:48.091
Or an angry stab in the face?

14:48.124 --> 14:49.994
Don't play dumb with me.

14:50.027 --> 14:51.837
I know about your mistress.
I know about La Palapa.

14:51.861 --> 14:53.496
I know about the flan.

14:53.529 --> 14:54.673
- Babe, wait.
- Oh, I've been waiting.

14:54.697 --> 14:56.701
I waited all night to do this.

14:56.734 --> 14:58.069
We're done. It's over.

14:58.101 --> 15:00.470
What? No.

15:01.537 --> 15:03.073
I don't have a mistress.

15:03.106 --> 15:05.475
That woman's name is Señora Reyes.

15:05.508 --> 15:06.744
She's my Spanish teacher.

15:06.777 --> 15:08.446
- Oh, please.
- No, I'm serious.

15:08.479 --> 15:09.755
The only reason we
were even at La Palapa

15:09.779 --> 15:11.481
was so I can practice
ordering in Spanish.

15:11.514 --> 15:12.716
Ah... by the way...

15:12.749 --> 15:16.619
_

15:16.653 --> 15:17.620
It did?

15:17.653 --> 15:20.725
_

15:20.727 --> 15:23.161
_

15:23.627 --> 15:26.030
Oh, my God.

15:26.062 --> 15:27.697
Oh, my God.

15:27.730 --> 15:30.100
Adrian, I'm so sorry. You
must be so mad at me.

15:30.133 --> 15:31.768
What? No, of course I'm not mad at you.

15:31.802 --> 15:34.504
Are you kidding? Jealousy's,
like, the hottest emotion.

15:34.537 --> 15:35.572
Let's do this.

15:35.605 --> 15:36.673
Okay, let's do it.

15:39.509 --> 15:41.412
All right. This guy looks
like the gatekeeper.

15:41.445 --> 15:42.747
- Just follow my lead.
- Okay.

15:44.414 --> 15:46.449
Hey, how are ya?

15:46.483 --> 15:48.619
Just grabbing a couple things.

15:48.652 --> 15:52.523
Ham puffs, a single tampon,
and a hot rod magazine?

15:52.556 --> 15:54.124
- Know how we do.
- Ahh.

15:55.585 --> 15:57.589
Hey, listen, we're looking
to score some kicks.

15:57.622 --> 15:58.590
You know where we can find some?

15:58.623 --> 16:00.425
Yeah. The mall.

16:00.457 --> 16:03.327
The mall. What do we look
like, Jay and Silent Bob?

16:07.364 --> 16:09.334
Actually, yeah.

16:09.366 --> 16:10.701
Fair enough.

16:10.734 --> 16:12.336
Look, we're friends with Jenny McFadden.

16:12.369 --> 16:15.472
Okay. Well, if that's true,

16:15.505 --> 16:17.708
tell me what her favorite shoe is.

16:17.741 --> 16:20.211
Old school Impala All-Stars.

16:21.910 --> 16:24.380
- Okay. I'll go get her.
- Great.

16:24.483 --> 16:25.682
I can't believe that worked.

16:25.715 --> 16:27.771
I just guessed the coolest
shoe I knew and I was right.

16:27.772 --> 16:28.772
Nope, he's running away.

16:31.475 --> 16:33.110
Ugh, these shoes are so uncomfortable!

16:33.143 --> 16:34.678
They're dress sneakers,

16:34.711 --> 16:36.114
you're not supposed to run in them.

16:37.514 --> 16:38.616
Freeze!

16:38.649 --> 16:40.651
NYPD. Let me see your hands.

16:40.685 --> 16:42.421
I didn't do anything.

16:42.454 --> 16:43.789
Then why were you running?

16:43.821 --> 16:44.898
I didn't want any trouble.
I have two priors.

16:44.922 --> 16:46.524
Where is Jenny McFadden?

16:46.557 --> 16:48.092
There is no Jenny McFadden.

16:48.125 --> 16:49.936
That's a cover for the
dude who steals the shoes.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.629
His name is Morris Richman.

16:51.662 --> 16:53.498
Oh, no.

16:53.531 --> 16:54.874
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Why are you freaking out?

16:54.898 --> 16:55.942
This is great. You were right all along.

16:55.966 --> 16:57.668
It was Morris Richman.

16:57.701 --> 16:58.778
You'll definitely pass
your evaluation now.

16:58.802 --> 17:00.838
Yeah, the only thing is...

17:00.872 --> 17:03.741
You let Morris Richman go?

17:06.210 --> 17:07.746
Single tampon?

17:09.075 --> 17:10.809
I am in shock, Peralta.

17:10.890 --> 17:13.558
I can't believe you
released Morris Richman.

17:13.560 --> 17:14.792
We have evidence.

17:14.826 --> 17:16.012
Great evidence that Jake found.

17:16.036 --> 17:18.048
Exactly, which makes it even
worse that he let him go.

17:18.071 --> 17:20.084
That's not fair. I was trying
to help, but he tricked me.

17:20.108 --> 17:23.080
You blew this case. You
bungled your evaluation,

17:23.083 --> 17:25.720
and you never retrieved
my father's pencil.

17:25.753 --> 17:27.059
Sir, I am happy to get you a new pencil.

17:27.083 --> 17:28.419
It won't be the same.
And now you're just

17:28.443 --> 17:29.778
standing here, mum as a mouse.

17:29.811 --> 17:31.446
Have you nothing to say for yourself?

17:31.480 --> 17:33.382
- I can explain.
- Of course he can.

17:33.415 --> 17:35.517
My boy's got bunches of explunches.
Hit 'em, Jake.

17:35.550 --> 17:37.552
I'm not ready to be back.

17:37.586 --> 17:39.388
- You should suspend me.
- What?

17:40.688 --> 17:42.523
Look, when we arrested Richman

17:42.557 --> 17:45.160
and he said he didn't do it, I just...

17:45.193 --> 17:46.762
I couldn't stop thinking about it.

17:46.793 --> 17:48.396
I mean, what if he was
telling the truth?

17:48.429 --> 17:49.730
What if he was innocent

17:49.763 --> 17:51.800
and I was putting an
innocent man in jail?

17:51.832 --> 17:52.981
It's just...

17:53.702 --> 17:55.804
Feels a lot harder for me
to put another human being

17:55.837 --> 17:58.407
in prison after experiencing it myself.

17:58.439 --> 17:59.774
It's really horrible.

17:59.808 --> 18:01.477
Look, I wanted to be back in the field,

18:01.509 --> 18:02.877
because I wanted to be the old me,

18:02.910 --> 18:06.581
but the truth is, I'm
not the old me yet.

18:06.615 --> 18:07.849
Maybe I never will be.

18:09.917 --> 18:12.387
Anyways, I'm gonna go
cry in the bathroom.

18:12.419 --> 18:14.422
Peace out, homies.

18:17.559 --> 18:19.561
Hey. What's going on?

18:19.593 --> 18:21.129
I thought everything worked out.

18:21.163 --> 18:22.472
Is there a reason you're still upset?

18:22.496 --> 18:23.831
What makes you think I'm upset?

18:23.865 --> 18:25.767
The giant hole you
carved into the table.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.603
Oops. Didn't notice.

18:29.204 --> 18:30.205
There. Fixed it.

18:30.236 --> 18:31.872
Look, I get it.

18:31.907 --> 18:33.550
You feel guilty about
accusing him of cheating.

18:33.574 --> 18:35.576
That's on me.

18:35.609 --> 18:38.179
I encouraged you because of all
my unresolved Chiaki issues.

18:38.212 --> 18:40.815
_

18:40.849 --> 18:42.885
No, it's not that, it's just...

18:42.917 --> 18:44.820
Last night, when I ended
things with Adrian,

18:44.852 --> 18:47.156
I had this huge feeling of relief.

18:47.188 --> 18:48.689
It's the first time in a long time

18:48.723 --> 18:50.158
that I felt like myself again.

18:50.192 --> 18:51.827
Oh, Rosa.

18:51.859 --> 18:53.470
I think I got so worked up
about him cheating on me

18:53.494 --> 18:54.929
because I wanted it to be true.

18:54.963 --> 18:56.831
I needed an excuse to end things.

18:56.865 --> 18:59.801
And now I don't know what to do.

18:59.832 --> 19:01.869
I think you do know what to do.

19:02.837 --> 19:04.573
Thanks, Amy.

19:08.475 --> 19:09.878
I have no idea what she's gonna do

19:09.910 --> 19:11.622
but that's the safest way
to give Rosa advice.

19:11.646 --> 19:12.781
Yep.

19:14.648 --> 19:15.816
Packing your desk.

19:15.849 --> 19:17.586
That's a major downer.

19:17.619 --> 19:19.288
Yeah, so why are you smiling like that?

19:19.320 --> 19:20.688
We found Morris Richman.

19:20.722 --> 19:22.456
Nuh-uh, Jake found him.

19:22.490 --> 19:24.193
We talked about this, Boyle.

19:24.224 --> 19:25.536
We agreed that if you
couldn't keep it together,

19:25.560 --> 19:26.528
you couldn't be a part of this.

19:26.561 --> 19:27.629
I'll be good.

19:28.663 --> 19:29.903
We went through your case file,

19:29.930 --> 19:31.667
and everything we needed was there.

19:31.699 --> 19:33.936
Richman's aliases, his known associates,

19:33.968 --> 19:36.504
and an address in Queens that
he used as a safe house.

19:36.538 --> 19:37.772
The 2-7 just picked him up.

19:37.805 --> 19:38.773
Tell him the other stuff. Tell him.

19:38.807 --> 19:39.841
Tell him now.

19:39.874 --> 19:41.510
Yeah. I can't be here.

19:43.911 --> 19:45.746
When you demanded to be
put back on the field,

19:45.780 --> 19:47.482
I worried that you were being flippant

19:47.514 --> 19:49.217
about your time in prison.

19:49.251 --> 19:51.619
I thought you would be
reckless, but I was wrong.

19:51.653 --> 19:54.223
Prison has made you more cautious.

19:54.255 --> 19:56.958
Yeah, but what if I'm too cautious now?

19:56.992 --> 19:58.835
I mean, I used to see
everything as black and white,

19:58.859 --> 20:01.229
and now, it's looking real gray to me.

20:01.263 --> 20:03.932
I wish every cop had a voice
in their head asking,

20:03.965 --> 20:05.801
what if he's innocent?

20:05.833 --> 20:07.902
You see it as weakness, but
it means you're growing.

20:07.936 --> 20:10.339
It makes you a better detective.

20:10.371 --> 20:11.772
So, you passed your evaluation.

20:11.805 --> 20:13.241
You can go back in the field.

20:13.274 --> 20:14.876
Oh.

20:16.278 --> 20:17.813
Wow.

20:17.846 --> 20:19.580
Thank you for passing me.

20:19.613 --> 20:20.915
But I actually feel like

20:20.947 --> 20:23.283
I need a little bit
more time to readjust.

20:23.318 --> 20:25.654
I think I should ride the
desk for a few more weeks.

20:27.589 --> 20:28.791
I respect that.

20:30.792 --> 20:32.303
Okay, Charles, you can come hug us now.

20:32.327 --> 20:33.662
We know you're still there.

20:33.695 --> 20:35.263
- I never left.
- Ugh!

20:35.297 --> 20:36.665
Thank you for understanding.

20:36.697 --> 20:37.799
Yeah.

20:37.831 --> 20:39.801
Oh. Look.

20:39.833 --> 20:41.802
Oh, boy.

20:41.836 --> 20:44.806
- Here's your blood back.
- Mm.

20:44.839 --> 20:47.708
Well, in that case,

20:47.742 --> 20:49.578
I guess you should have
your blood back too.

20:49.610 --> 20:51.345
What? How did you get this?

20:51.378 --> 20:52.890
You know, I might want a
couple minutes up here alone.

20:52.914 --> 20:55.584
Just to kinda process this, you know.

20:55.617 --> 20:57.985
Of course.

21:05.760 --> 21:07.296
So, how'd it go?

21:07.329 --> 21:08.809
It actually went surprisingly well...

21:14.002 --> 21:16.570
No! Rosa!

21:21.009 --> 21:22.889
Honestly, this is the best
I could've asked for.
