WEBVTT

00:04.221 --> 00:05.831
There you are.

00:05.875 --> 00:07.529
Why aren't you in bed?

00:07.572 --> 00:11.011
I just put the moves
on your pillow.

00:11.054 --> 00:13.926
I remembered that Emme has to do
a "My Life" project for school

00:13.970 --> 00:15.754
and she asked
for some baby pictures.

00:15.798 --> 00:17.321
Project, school, baby.

00:17.365 --> 00:19.497
These are not sexy words.

00:19.541 --> 00:22.065
I can't find any of Emme.

00:22.109 --> 00:24.894
We have a ton of the
older kids. You see?

00:24.937 --> 00:27.549
We have Kate and Teddy, each
going potty for the first time.

00:29.072 --> 00:31.553
Look at the boy strainin'.

00:33.381 --> 00:36.384
Face like a frustrated tomato.

00:36.427 --> 00:38.690
Well, what happened?
It's like we started off

00:38.734 --> 00:41.345
as good parents
and then we just gave up.

00:41.389 --> 00:45.175
Okay, let's look at it
in baseball terms, okay?

00:45.219 --> 00:47.221
We won the first two games
of the series,

00:47.264 --> 00:48.744
and then we phoned in the third.

00:50.224 --> 00:51.921
We were saving our bullpen.

00:51.964 --> 00:54.358
Wait a minute.
Didn't I ask you to put a box

00:54.402 --> 00:56.578
of old baby pictures
in the top of Kate's closet?

00:56.621 --> 01:00.103
I don't know. You tell me to put
a lot of boxes a lot of places.

01:00.147 --> 01:01.626
Come on, help me
get them down.

01:01.670 --> 01:03.933
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
What if we fooled around,

01:03.976 --> 01:06.936
thengot the pictures?Oh, honey,

01:06.979 --> 01:08.198
if you're that worked up,

01:08.242 --> 01:09.634
just finish what you started
with my pillow.

01:13.334 --> 01:17.425
I don't even know if your pillow
likes me like that.

01:20.210 --> 01:22.734
: Shh. We
don't want to wake her up.

01:22.778 --> 01:24.432
She's our favorite.

01:24.475 --> 01:25.998
That's not funny.

01:34.311 --> 01:36.922
Kate.

01:36.966 --> 01:38.968
What are you doing?
Did you sneak out?

01:39.011 --> 01:40.970
Why am I still whispering?

01:42.232 --> 01:43.407
Downstairs. Now.

01:43.451 --> 01:44.756
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.672
This is her first sneak-out.
Hold on.

01:49.848 --> 01:52.024
Oh! It's a keeper.: Yeah.

02:03.601 --> 02:04.950
Kate, why would you sneak out?

02:04.994 --> 02:07.736
Was it boys? Booze?
Boys andbooze?

02:07.779 --> 02:10.782
No, it wasn't like that.
I-I was at Shelby's.

02:10.826 --> 02:12.871
We both like A55-4U.

02:12.915 --> 02:13.959
Wh-What is that?

02:14.003 --> 02:16.136
What is that?
Some new drug? Huh?

02:16.179 --> 02:17.876
Andi, get me a frying
pan and an egg.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.530
We're doing the
"brain on drugs" thing.

02:19.574 --> 02:22.403
No, no, no!
It's-it's a band I like.

02:22.446 --> 02:23.969
Okay, well, if that's true,

02:24.013 --> 02:25.928
why didn't you just tell us
you were going out?

02:25.971 --> 02:28.757
Because it's a school night,
and I knew Dad wouldn't let me.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.585
It's like I'm in jail.

02:30.628 --> 02:32.804
Oh, well...

02:32.848 --> 02:34.589
we don't want you to feel
like a prisoner.

02:34.632 --> 02:36.939
Yes, we do.

02:36.982 --> 02:39.898
This is a prison,
and your sentence is 18 years.

02:39.942 --> 02:41.552
Hold on.

02:41.596 --> 02:44.294
Maybe we should hear
what she has to say.

02:44.338 --> 02:46.731
She did her talking when
she climbed out her window.

02:46.775 --> 02:48.559
Adam.
Andi!
Dad!

02:48.603 --> 02:50.126
You go to your room.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.911
This is so unfair!

02:52.955 --> 02:55.827
I was just listening
to music!

02:55.871 --> 02:57.307
Katie stomping up the stairs--

02:57.351 --> 02:59.396
that's music
welisten to every day!

03:00.484 --> 03:02.051
Hilarious!

03:03.531 --> 03:04.836
Adam.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.838
Wait for the door slam.

03:09.276 --> 03:10.973
What are you doing?What are youdoing?

03:11.016 --> 03:13.062
I am thinking
about our daughter, okay?

03:13.105 --> 03:15.064
Caring about
how your children feel

03:15.107 --> 03:17.153
is part of being
a modern parent.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.982
Oh, modern parenting
is ruining our country.

03:20.025 --> 03:21.375
Okay? We coddle

03:21.418 --> 03:25.117
our kids so that everyone
thinks they're special.

03:25.161 --> 03:28.469
You know who was special?
Mary Lou Retton.

03:28.512 --> 03:30.514
Oh, this is gonna take a while.

03:30.558 --> 03:32.386
Yeah. Settle in.

03:32.429 --> 03:34.214
Did Mary Lou Retton get a hug

03:34.257 --> 03:36.390
when she fell off
the balance beam?

03:36.433 --> 03:40.350
No. She got screamed at
by an angry, old Romanian.

03:41.482 --> 03:43.440
So she dug deep
and won the gold.

03:43.484 --> 03:45.137
Well, maybe Mary Lou
would've been happier

03:45.181 --> 03:47.009
if she'd gotten a few more hugs.Uh-huh, yeah.

03:47.052 --> 03:49.011
You know what feels better
than a hug?

03:49.054 --> 03:50.882
Kicking Russia's ass
in gymnastics!

03:52.754 --> 03:54.538
And while I feel like
I have the upper hand,

03:54.582 --> 03:55.974
there's something else
I want to say

03:56.018 --> 03:57.889
that I have been holding in
for a long time.

03:57.933 --> 03:59.935
This all goes back

03:59.978 --> 04:01.284
to sleep training.

04:01.328 --> 04:04.592
Oh, my God.
That was 15 years ago!

04:04.635 --> 04:06.115
Since the beginning of time,

04:06.158 --> 04:09.292
kids have figured out
how to go to sleep.

04:09.336 --> 04:12.208
They cried until they got bored,
and when no one came in,

04:12.252 --> 04:13.209
they nodded off.

04:14.384 --> 04:16.647
And those cave kids
were so well-rested,

04:16.691 --> 04:18.170
they invented fire!

04:20.172 --> 04:22.871
But then, in the year 2003,

04:22.914 --> 04:26.962
some parents decided
that they knew better.

04:28.398 --> 04:31.445
And those parents...
are sitting on our couch.

04:33.708 --> 04:35.840
I know we agreed
to let Kate cry it out,

04:35.884 --> 04:37.015
but I couldn't do it.

04:37.059 --> 04:38.408
All right?

04:38.452 --> 04:40.236
And when I picked her up,
she loved me so much.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.238
Well, I hope it was worth it.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.371
Because I can draw a direct line

04:44.414 --> 04:45.633
between you picking Katie up

04:45.676 --> 04:47.678
to her climbing
through a window.

04:47.722 --> 04:50.899
Modern parenting.

04:50.942 --> 04:53.815
Well, I don't want our kids
sneaking out.

04:53.858 --> 04:55.251
I don't know.

04:55.295 --> 04:59.037
Maybe-- maybe--
I've been too easy on her.

04:59.081 --> 04:59.908
Yes.

04:59.951 --> 05:02.389
And maybe-- maybe--

05:02.432 --> 05:05.435
we need to shake things up,
get this thing back on track.

05:05.479 --> 05:06.958
No, I-I can see that.

05:07.002 --> 05:09.570
I mean, you know,
somewhere between cave kids

05:09.613 --> 05:12.094
and angry Romanians,
you made a good point.

05:13.225 --> 05:15.619
Okay. You're in charge.

05:15.663 --> 05:17.142
Really?

05:17.186 --> 05:19.101
Yeah. What do you
want to do?

05:19.144 --> 05:21.277
I have dreamed
about this moment.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.758
Okay, first of all,
no more modern.

05:23.801 --> 05:26.369
We are going old school.
Shock and awe.

05:26.413 --> 05:28.415
Huh? But you got to back me up.

05:28.458 --> 05:29.807
Oh, you-you have my word.

05:29.851 --> 05:31.505
I won't even give her
the pizza bagel I made

05:31.548 --> 05:32.941
'cause she was hungry
from sneaking out.

05:32.984 --> 05:35.726
I'll take it.
Dads eat first.

05:37.075 --> 05:38.468
That's old school.

05:40.383 --> 05:42.124
ANDI:
So, Emme,

05:42.167 --> 05:43.299
obviously, I took

05:43.343 --> 05:44.692
a million baby pictures of you,

05:44.735 --> 05:46.476
but I can't find any of them

05:46.520 --> 05:48.478
because your old babysitter
stole them.

05:49.523 --> 05:51.133
Yeah, yeah, she, uh,

05:51.176 --> 05:52.830
she-she sent them
to a modeling agency

05:52.874 --> 05:54.179
since you're so darn cute.

05:56.181 --> 05:58.009
But don't try to track
those pictures down.

05:58.053 --> 06:02.710
That modeling agency was
swallowed by a giant whale.

06:02.753 --> 06:04.102
Uh-huh.

06:05.147 --> 06:07.149
So, for your
school project,

06:07.192 --> 06:08.803
we are going to...

06:08.846 --> 06:11.501
fake a baby picture.Pop in this binky,

06:11.545 --> 06:13.895
and we'll take one from far away
so you look small.

06:17.420 --> 06:19.117
KATE:
Oh, my God! Mom!

06:19.161 --> 06:22.120
Dad took my door!

06:23.252 --> 06:25.036
Welcome to the old school.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.473
Katie, you have shown

06:26.516 --> 06:27.517
that you can't be trusted.

06:27.561 --> 06:28.823
This way,

06:28.866 --> 06:30.694
I can keep track
of your every move.

06:30.738 --> 06:33.697
Plus, what are you gonna
slam now, Slammy Davis Jr.?

06:41.226 --> 06:43.403
Why do we have so many doors?

06:44.534 --> 06:46.318
This seems hard.
Have you considered

06:46.362 --> 06:48.886
just letting it be
her boyfriend's problem someday?

06:52.063 --> 06:54.718
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

07:01.856 --> 07:03.858
What are you doing?

07:03.901 --> 07:06.251
Katie is in her closet
laughing it up

07:06.295 --> 07:08.210
with her friend on the phone.

07:08.253 --> 07:10.430
She is in trouble.
Why is she laughing?

07:10.473 --> 07:11.648
Well...I'll tell you why.

07:11.692 --> 07:13.563
Okay, you go.

07:13.607 --> 07:15.260
Modern parenting.

07:17.698 --> 07:19.917
Oh, that's it?

07:19.961 --> 07:21.876
I thought you were gonna talk
for ten minutes again,

07:21.919 --> 07:24.400
and I was gonna go grab
a granola bar for sustenance.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.489
She doesn't get to be happy.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.709
In old school, no one is happy.

07:28.752 --> 07:32.234
Look at any old-timey
picture. Miserable!

07:32.277 --> 07:33.496
Mm.

07:36.978 --> 07:38.458
Eh-eh-eh?

07:40.895 --> 07:41.765
Busted.

07:41.809 --> 07:42.940
For what?

07:42.984 --> 07:45.552
Excessive laughing.

07:45.595 --> 07:47.989
You just lost
your closet door, missy.

07:49.120 --> 07:52.123
Andi, get my tools.

07:52.167 --> 07:53.777
Why don't you
just take her phone?

07:53.821 --> 07:55.257
That's smarter.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.737
And meaner.

07:56.780 --> 07:59.087
You just lost your phone, missy.

08:00.958 --> 08:03.918
She'll call you back
in a few years.

08:03.961 --> 08:05.354
Wait, hold on.

08:05.397 --> 08:08.270
I need that. I'm doing a
group project for Spanish.

08:08.313 --> 08:11.012
Oh. Okay, well,
if it's for school,

08:11.055 --> 08:13.405
you can have a phone.
I'm reasonable.

08:13.449 --> 08:15.843
I'm not reasonable.

08:15.886 --> 08:17.584
Enjoy your new phone.

08:18.933 --> 08:21.631
It's so old; is it for
talking to dead people?

08:23.328 --> 08:24.982
From now on, this...

08:25.026 --> 08:27.419
is the only phone
you are allowed to use.

08:27.463 --> 08:31.075
AndI can keep an eye on you,
because you can only go as far

08:31.119 --> 08:33.513
as the cord will reach.

08:39.475 --> 08:41.956
I got to make that cord shorter.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.525
Where'd you even get that thing?

08:46.743 --> 08:47.831
Where's our phone?

08:48.876 --> 08:50.399
Adam said he needed it.

08:50.442 --> 08:52.619
He better not be calling
long distance.

08:53.794 --> 08:55.447
KATE:
So, I'll start the presentation

08:55.491 --> 08:59.408
by saying, "La historia
de los conquistadores

08:59.451 --> 09:01.541
es muy fascinante."

09:03.455 --> 09:05.414
Enjoying your breakfast?

09:05.457 --> 09:09.549
I know this is annoying,
but it is all gonna pay off.

09:15.337 --> 09:16.599
Spoon?

09:16.643 --> 09:19.297
Thank you.

09:19.341 --> 09:22.344
And then you'll say,
"Yo no sabia eso."

09:22.387 --> 09:23.780
I'll bet she's saying
curse words.

09:23.824 --> 09:24.999
She's real mad at you.

09:25.042 --> 09:27.001
Good. By the way,

09:27.044 --> 09:29.830
part of our old-school rules,
kids clean up after themselves.

09:29.873 --> 09:32.659
Can you please put
your dirty glass in the sink?

09:32.702 --> 09:33.747
Happy to.

09:33.790 --> 09:35.487
Mm-hmm.

09:35.531 --> 09:37.794
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

09:37.838 --> 09:39.709
I will clear the table.

09:41.537 --> 09:43.104
Yeah, that's good.

09:43.147 --> 09:45.628
And then I'll say,

09:45.672 --> 09:50.720
"Los conquistadores eran
guerreros viciosos."

09:54.550 --> 09:55.856
All right.

09:55.899 --> 09:57.988
Katie, honey...

09:58.032 --> 10:00.382
let me show
you something.

10:04.821 --> 10:07.041
Adam, do we have a...

10:07.084 --> 10:10.522
time frame on how long
this is gonna take?

10:10.566 --> 10:12.873
I mean, when do
we know we won?

10:12.916 --> 10:16.224
When she says, "I was wrong.
You were right. I'm sorry."

10:16.267 --> 10:19.575
You know, that thing
I always end up saying to you.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.403
But you're so good at it.

10:21.446 --> 10:24.406
Practice does
make perfect.

10:24.449 --> 10:28.845
Kate was outside speaking
Spanish into my telephone.

10:28.889 --> 10:31.674
If that was an international
call, you're paying for it.

10:33.850 --> 10:36.548
Hey, Dad, you're
gonna love this.

10:36.592 --> 10:38.072
Since we caught
Katie sneaking out,

10:38.115 --> 10:40.422
I have been making
her life miserable

10:40.465 --> 10:42.859
with some tough,
old-school parenting.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.687
Oh, really giving her
the business, huh?

10:44.731 --> 10:46.515
Oh, I am locked in.

10:46.558 --> 10:50.084
I was up all night thinking of
different ways to bum Katie out.

10:50.127 --> 10:51.563
So you're turning
your life upside down

10:51.607 --> 10:54.175
to teach a kid a lesson?Yeah.

10:54.218 --> 10:57.091
That's the furthest thing
from old school I've ever heard.

10:57.134 --> 10:59.833
What? What?
You don't get it.

10:59.876 --> 11:02.444
I took Katie's
bedroom door.

11:02.487 --> 11:06.361
A door is like a teenager's
favorite thing, and I took it!

11:06.404 --> 11:09.756
That is stone-cold old.

11:09.799 --> 11:11.322
Son, when you were a kid,

11:11.366 --> 11:13.847
I didn't even know
if you had a door.

11:13.890 --> 11:16.153
That'sold school.

11:16.197 --> 11:18.547
We believed
in fresh air for kids.

11:18.590 --> 11:21.942
Every morning, we just put you
outside like a milk bottle.

11:21.985 --> 11:23.987
What?

11:26.033 --> 11:28.862
Oh, no.

11:28.905 --> 11:32.561
Adam, what's wrong,
honey? Are...? Oh.

11:32.604 --> 11:35.520
Are-are you sad 'cause your dad
didn't know if you had a door?

11:35.564 --> 11:38.959
What? It's worse than that.

11:39.002 --> 11:40.961
I'm a modern parent.

11:41.004 --> 11:42.789
Bev, he seems upset.

11:42.832 --> 11:45.705
Give him one of
your muscle relaxers.

11:52.102 --> 11:53.713
I can't believe this.
I'm so modern,

11:53.756 --> 11:55.802
I don't even know
what old school is anymore.

11:55.845 --> 11:58.369
I'm like a cat
wearing a dog costume.

12:00.197 --> 12:01.503
Well, you've always
been sensitive.

12:01.546 --> 12:02.330
Remember that time

12:02.373 --> 12:03.810
you stood in front of

12:03.853 --> 12:05.550
the lobster tank crying?

12:05.594 --> 12:07.335
I was six.

12:07.378 --> 12:09.380
You told me
to pick my favorite one.

12:09.424 --> 12:12.296
I didn't know
what was gonna happen next.

12:12.340 --> 12:15.604
They put the bib on him,
and all hell broke loose.Yeah.

12:16.997 --> 12:18.172
Well, don't beat yourself up.

12:18.215 --> 12:19.826
I mean, you're not so modern.

12:19.869 --> 12:22.567
You still hose down the driveway
in your bathrobe.

12:22.611 --> 12:25.875
That's just to give
the neighbor ladies a thrill.

12:25.919 --> 12:28.399
Hey,

12:28.443 --> 12:31.315
Grandma, do you have that
baby picture for my project?

12:31.359 --> 12:33.187
I sure do, honey.

12:33.230 --> 12:35.015
There you go.Thanks.

12:35.058 --> 12:36.756
Hmm.
Wow.

12:36.799 --> 12:39.062
Did you see that?
We didn't have

12:39.106 --> 12:40.716
what Emme needed,
so she asked Bev.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.804
She's resourceful.

12:43.066 --> 12:44.589
Yeah, we raised her right.Yeah.

12:44.633 --> 12:45.982
She's the one
we raised the least.

12:49.943 --> 12:51.988
That's true.

12:52.032 --> 12:55.687
We did the best job with Emme
by barely doing the job at all.

12:56.906 --> 12:59.300
That's what we should be
doing with Katie.

12:59.343 --> 13:02.259
Back off and let life
teach her some lessons.

13:02.303 --> 13:04.348
Oh, I like it.
I can really

13:04.392 --> 13:06.394
get behind that,
instead of fake getting behind

13:06.437 --> 13:07.874
what you were doing before.

13:07.917 --> 13:11.399
Yes, you can,
because I re-figured this out.

13:11.442 --> 13:14.445
I thought I was old school,
but I was really new school.

13:14.489 --> 13:18.623
Now I need to go oldold school.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.451
You already talked
more about this

13:20.495 --> 13:22.758
than I've talked about
you in your entire life.

13:24.934 --> 13:26.718
I keep looking for
a way to leave,

13:26.762 --> 13:27.937
but he just won't stop.Yeah.

13:29.069 --> 13:30.461
You know what?

13:30.505 --> 13:32.681
Keep the phone.
Life's too short.

13:36.467 --> 13:38.121
Your mother and I
have decided to go

13:38.165 --> 13:39.819
with a different punishment.

13:39.862 --> 13:41.429
From now on, we're gonna
give you morefreedom.

13:41.472 --> 13:43.257
How do you feel
about that?

13:43.300 --> 13:45.607
I... like it?Hmm.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.652
Well, you won't for long,

13:47.696 --> 13:49.959
because in real life,
there's consequences.

13:50.003 --> 13:51.831
Yeah, you think
we're tough?

13:51.874 --> 13:53.963
Life's a real
son of a gun.

13:54.007 --> 13:57.662
Yes, it is, so good luck
running your own life.

13:57.706 --> 13:59.839
Cool. I'm going to a concert
Thursday night.

13:59.882 --> 14:02.276
What?Andi, that's her decision.

14:02.319 --> 14:05.192
Yeah, but that's
a school night.
Mm-mm-mm.

14:05.235 --> 14:07.107
You know,
for your first choice,

14:07.150 --> 14:08.891
I was expecting...Mm-mm-mm.

14:08.935 --> 14:11.111
...something small,
like, you know,

14:11.154 --> 14:13.243
swimming right after you eat.

14:13.287 --> 14:15.289
But I can still go, right?

14:15.332 --> 14:16.246
Absolutely.

14:16.290 --> 14:17.465
And on Friday morning,

14:17.508 --> 14:19.206
when you're too tired

14:19.249 --> 14:21.469
to learn anything at school,
and you don't get into college,

14:21.512 --> 14:23.950
and you end up a milky-eyed
drifter, that's on you.

14:23.993 --> 14:26.343
Enjoy sleeping in a boxcar.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.740
ADAM:
Come on!

14:31.783 --> 14:34.177
This guy's climbing
a jungle gym.

14:34.221 --> 14:38.094
He does not deserve
the title of "ninja warrior."

14:38.138 --> 14:40.314
Adam, I don't like this.

14:40.357 --> 14:42.925
I mean, Kate is at a
concert on a school night.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.535
I mean, what's she
doing? Is she dancing?

14:44.579 --> 14:46.494
Is she vaping?
What's vaping? I...

14:46.537 --> 14:48.496
Stay strong.

14:48.539 --> 14:49.976
Remember Emme?

14:50.019 --> 14:51.934
I mean, remember how
we didn't remember Emme?

14:51.978 --> 14:54.850
Lady Gaga would say she
was just born that way.

14:54.894 --> 14:58.636
I don't care what
the Lady of Gaga says.

14:58.680 --> 15:03.163
I am Adam of Pittsburgh,
and I say we need to back off

15:03.206 --> 15:05.861
and let Katie learn
about consequences.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.819
Okay.

15:07.863 --> 15:10.692
But maybe I'll just
google the band to see

15:10.735 --> 15:12.694
if there's any news
stories from the venue.

15:12.737 --> 15:14.957
You do what you need to do.
I want no part of it.Okay.

15:15.001 --> 15:17.699
Oh, hey, what was the
name of that band again?

15:17.742 --> 15:19.701
It was a bunch of letters
and numbers.

15:19.744 --> 15:21.616
I could do this.

15:21.659 --> 15:23.096
I should try out
for this.

15:23.139 --> 15:24.706
Oh, hey.

15:24.749 --> 15:26.186
Emme, honey,
do you remember the name

15:26.229 --> 15:28.014
of that band
that Kate likes?

15:28.057 --> 15:29.450
Yeah, it's A55-4U.

15:29.493 --> 15:30.886
Ah.

15:32.235 --> 15:34.890
God, Emme's great.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.547
A55-4U. Huh.

15:39.590 --> 15:41.157
What does that even mean?

15:41.201 --> 15:45.814
You know, when we were kids,
bands had names that made sense.

15:45.857 --> 15:49.165
Like... Men Without Hats.

15:49.209 --> 15:54.214
You knew what they were, and
you knew what their problem was.

15:54.257 --> 15:56.216
Wait, wait, wait.
Look at this.Mm.

15:56.259 --> 15:59.306
When I typed it out, the
two fives look like S's.

15:59.349 --> 16:03.571
"A55-4U" is really...
"Ass-For-You."

16:03.614 --> 16:05.703
Oh, we're gonna lose
the next war.

16:07.792 --> 16:10.752
Okay, well, there's no bad news
from tonight's

16:10.795 --> 16:14.930
Ass-For-You concert
at... Obermeyer College?

16:14.974 --> 16:17.324
What? The concert's
at a college?

16:17.367 --> 16:18.934
Where college boys are?

16:18.978 --> 16:20.936
Yeah, and-and their
college-boy beds.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.504
That's the thing about
college boys-- they have beds!

16:23.547 --> 16:25.680
Yeah.The hell with this.
I'm calling her.

16:34.515 --> 16:36.821
You didn't give her
back her phone?

16:36.865 --> 16:38.432
You didn't remind me
to give her back her phone!

16:38.475 --> 16:39.781
You didn't tell me to remind you
to give her back her phone!

16:39.824 --> 16:42.262
This consequen--

16:42.305 --> 16:44.438
This consequences thing
is happening to us!

16:44.481 --> 16:46.788
Life isa son of a gun!

16:46.831 --> 16:48.442
We-we have to
go get her.

16:48.485 --> 16:50.270
Yeah, okay. Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

16:50.313 --> 16:51.836
If we go down there,

16:51.880 --> 16:53.795
she'll know we couldn't
old-school her, either.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.971
Okay.

16:56.015 --> 16:59.496
What if we send someone else
down there to go check on her?

16:59.540 --> 17:03.326
Way to find
a loophole, baby!

17:03.370 --> 17:06.155
But what kind of weirdo
grown-ups do we know

17:06.199 --> 17:09.985
that would drop everything
to go to an Ass-For-You concert?

17:10.029 --> 17:11.552
Thanks for the
tickets, Adam.

17:11.595 --> 17:13.510
Ass-For-You is
my workout jam.

17:13.554 --> 17:15.860
Lowell, have
you seen Katie?

17:15.904 --> 17:16.687
Not yet.

17:16.731 --> 17:18.080
Put Don on the phone.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.647
Oh, good idea.
He'll spot her.

17:19.690 --> 17:21.257
He's so tall, he
can see everything.

17:21.301 --> 17:22.519
He's like Google Earth.

17:24.217 --> 17:25.696
Go for Don.

17:25.740 --> 17:27.133
Any sign of Katie?

17:27.176 --> 17:29.309
No dice. I even stood
outside the girl's bathroom

17:29.352 --> 17:32.355
for a half hour until security
told me to move along.

17:32.399 --> 17:33.704
We need to find Katie!

17:33.748 --> 17:34.966
Don't worry, brother.

17:35.010 --> 17:37.186
You got the right two guys
on this mission.

17:37.230 --> 17:40.015
Lowell?!

17:40.059 --> 17:41.364
I-I'll tell you what.

17:41.408 --> 17:43.236
I'll find Lowell first,
and then I'll find Katie.

17:45.890 --> 17:47.805
Adam, I'm worried.

17:47.849 --> 17:49.633
And I love you enough
to tell you

17:49.677 --> 17:52.462
that if anything happens to her,
the media is gonna blame you,

17:52.506 --> 17:54.986
and I am not gonna be that wife
that sticks up for you.

17:55.030 --> 17:57.467
Screw it. Let's
go get our girl.

17:57.511 --> 17:58.947
Oh, yeah.

17:58.990 --> 18:00.383
And after all
that modern parenting,

18:00.427 --> 18:02.037
Kate can't survive
on her own.
Yeah.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.517
She's like a monkey
raised in captivity.

18:03.560 --> 18:04.909
Yeah, we can't
set her free now.

18:04.953 --> 18:06.389
She'll never find
her own bananas!

18:07.869 --> 18:10.350
Ah! Our monkey's safe!

18:10.393 --> 18:13.309
Oh, you came home.
I'm so proud of you.Oh.

18:13.353 --> 18:15.224
You are?
Yeah.

18:15.268 --> 18:17.705
Yeah, you realized
that going to a concert

18:17.748 --> 18:20.490
on a school night was not smart.

18:20.534 --> 18:21.839
Old school works.

18:21.883 --> 18:23.232
No, I still

18:23.276 --> 18:24.538
wanted to go to the concert,

18:24.581 --> 18:26.192
but no one else
was allowed to go.

18:26.235 --> 18:27.889
The other parents think
you guys are crazy.

18:27.932 --> 18:30.021
I'd expect some angry calls.

18:30.065 --> 18:33.242
Oh. So you didn't learn
any lessons?

18:33.286 --> 18:35.070
Not as far as I know.

18:37.725 --> 18:40.902
Don't look at me.
I wanted to hug her.

18:40.945 --> 18:44.775
So, what happens now?
Can I still do whatever I want?

18:44.819 --> 18:46.690
Huh.

18:46.734 --> 18:50.041
Yeah, that's
what I think: huh.

18:50.085 --> 18:51.956
That's a confusing answer.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.089
It sure is.

18:55.090 --> 18:56.396
And it's supposed to be,

18:56.439 --> 18:59.268
because that was our plan
all along.

19:01.096 --> 19:04.360
That's right.
All along, we had a plan.

19:04.404 --> 19:05.753
Yeah. We wanted
to keep you guessing

19:05.796 --> 19:09.626
by veering wildly
from crazy strict to super easy.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.672
Crazy strict,
super easy.

19:11.715 --> 19:13.369
Where are we?
You don't know.

19:13.413 --> 19:14.892
Yeah. You...

19:14.936 --> 19:16.503
are in the hands
of masters here.

19:16.546 --> 19:18.200
Ha!
Masters!

19:18.244 --> 19:21.160
Yeah, so go to your room.
And do whatever you want.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.992
BOTH:
I... I don't know.

19:34.260 --> 19:35.739
Well, we squeaked
through that one.
Yeah.

19:35.783 --> 19:37.915
If she hadn't come home,
we would've gone to get her.

19:37.959 --> 19:40.396
Yeah. We're not new
school, or old school,

19:40.440 --> 19:42.137
or oldold school.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.965
We got expelled
from every school.

19:46.054 --> 19:49.362
We have no power
because we love 'em too much.Mm.

19:49.405 --> 19:52.060
You know, kids-- they lock you
in early with their cuteness,

19:52.103 --> 19:54.454
and then you're screwed.

19:54.497 --> 19:58.893
So, how do you control
someone you love?

19:58.936 --> 20:02.375
Wait. How did you get me
to go see Mamma Mia on Ice?

20:02.418 --> 20:05.116
I locked you in early
with my cuteness,

20:05.160 --> 20:07.206
and now you're screwed.

20:08.685 --> 20:10.818
Ah, so I guess we
just white-knuckle it

20:10.861 --> 20:12.341
till Katie's out
of the house.

20:12.385 --> 20:14.952
Mm, maybe we let her be
her boyfriend's problem,

20:14.996 --> 20:17.041
go with Don's solution.

20:17.085 --> 20:20.393
Scary times.

20:20.436 --> 20:23.831
Hey, party people.

20:23.874 --> 20:25.876
Lowell, what happened?
Are you okay?

20:25.920 --> 20:28.488
It was the greatest night
of my life.

20:28.531 --> 20:30.533
I got swept up in the crowd,

20:30.577 --> 20:32.274
and someone gave me
a breath mint

20:32.318 --> 20:34.668
that made me love everybody.

20:37.192 --> 20:39.499
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Dad.
