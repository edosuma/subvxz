11:04.959 --> 11:07.083
- Make you think of Rex?
- I didn't think I would see..

11:07.083 --> 11:08.625
No. Most definitely does not.

11:08.625 --> 11:10.542
(Alice)
'Oh, my God,
what a huge surprise.'

11:10.542 --> 11:14.042
I had no idea
that you guys were coming.

11:14.042 --> 11:15.834
Well, I figured
I owed you one.

11:15.834 --> 11:17.125
And I slapped
a tracking bracelet

11:17.125 --> 11:19.250
on his ankle this time,
so the only way

11:19.250 --> 11:20.458
he is gonna miss
your performance

11:20.458 --> 11:21.959
is if he chews
his own leg off.

11:21.959 --> 11:23.208
Baby, with my
level of success

11:23.208 --> 11:25.125
you know I'd pay somebody
to chew it off for me.

11:25.125 --> 11:26.458
[laughing]

11:26.458 --> 11:29.375
- Oh, I stand corrected.
- Mm.

11:29.375 --> 11:33.000
I am so glad
you guys are here.
But I have to warn you.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.583
There was a major
strep epidemic at Lancer.

11:35.583 --> 11:39.667
We're down to a skeleton crew,
I really have no idea

11:39.667 --> 11:42.333
what you're gonna be
seeing today, dad.

11:42.333 --> 11:44.000
But you're still
gonna be fine.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
- Damn right.
- Well, good.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.084
Then I'm a happy man.

11:48.084 --> 11:49.333
Okay, well, I'm happy then.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.500
Okay, guys.
The floor is ours.

11:51.500 --> 11:54.167
Alright, Hellcats,
let's do it!

11:54.167 --> 11:57.125
- Let's get it!
- Yeah!

11:57.125 --> 11:59.417
Seven, eight, one, two..

12:03.375 --> 12:06.291
- We've been better.
- We have alternates flying.

12:06.291 --> 12:09.250
We have unfamiliar bases
catching them.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.041
We've lost our cohesion.

12:11.041 --> 12:12.583
It's gonna be dicey.

12:13.792 --> 12:15.291
You'll pull through.

12:18.166 --> 12:20.291
- Way to go, girls!
- Good, you got it!

12:21.167 --> 12:22.750
[upbeat music]

12:24.917 --> 12:29.083
Oh! Hey, can we get a medic?

12:29.083 --> 12:30.917
[groaning]

12:32.209 --> 12:33.166
- Yeah.
- Where's Savannah?

12:33.166 --> 12:34.417
She's not
answering her phone.

12:34.417 --> 12:36.208
Uh, she's a little
busy right now.

12:36.208 --> 12:38.166
Look, my water broke.
I'm having this baby.

12:38.166 --> 12:41.417
What? Well, you're still
a month away from
your due date.

12:41.417 --> 12:43.250
I'm hundreds
of miles from home

12:43.250 --> 12:45.125
going to a strange hospital
with a strange doctor.

12:45.125 --> 12:47.917
Yes, I'm sure,
you moron. Ohh!

12:47.917 --> 12:49.875
Charlotte.
Charlotte, breathe.

12:49.875 --> 12:53.083
Tell Savannah to get
to Saint Luke's hospital now.

12:53.083 --> 12:54.500
Yeah.

12:58.750 --> 13:01.000
- Oh, God! Oh!
- I've called an ambulance.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.084
Come on. We'll wait
for them out front.

13:03.084 --> 13:06.500
- You can do it. Just walk--
- What's wrong
with you, woman?

13:07.667 --> 13:08.875
Yeah. Dan is driving me now.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.291
I'll meet you
at the maternity ward.

13:10.291 --> 13:11.708
Alright, 15 minutes tops.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.125
- I love you. Bye.
- Here, change of clothes.

13:13.125 --> 13:14.500
Marti, I don't need
a change of clothes.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.125
We're goin' on the mat
in three hours.

13:16.125 --> 13:17.542
Listen, I'm gonna go situate
Charlotte, then come back

13:17.542 --> 13:18.667
for the performance and then
get back to the hospital

13:18.667 --> 13:20.333
before the baby is born.

13:20.333 --> 13:23.042
The first labor
is usually a minimum 17 hours.

13:23.042 --> 13:25.209
Only the last three
or so are hard labor.

13:25.209 --> 13:27.583
Except when it isn't.

13:27.583 --> 13:30.000
Negativity? Now? Really?

13:30.000 --> 13:32.042
Listen, I'm gonna
be there for my sister

13:32.042 --> 13:33.792
and help the Hellcats win.

13:38.500 --> 13:43.209
I bet you would
never do that for me.

13:43.209 --> 13:44.583
- Well, what do you mean?
- Oh.

13:44.583 --> 13:46.333
Go running after your sister
and leave everyone

13:46.333 --> 13:48.000
in the lurch
like "Hello Kitty" just did?

13:48.000 --> 13:51.041
Okay, wait. No, no. She's not
leaving anybody in a lurch.

13:51.041 --> 13:53.084
And look, just don't
talk like that

13:53.084 --> 13:55.084
in front of anybody
in the squad, okay?

13:55.084 --> 13:57.250
Okay.

13:57.250 --> 14:01.125
And yes, if you needed me,
I would...drop everything.

14:02.041 --> 14:04.417
- No, you wouldn't.
- I would.

14:04.417 --> 14:05.959
I know we don't know
each other very well

14:05.959 --> 14:09.041
but you're my sister and..

14:09.041 --> 14:11.167
...that means something to me.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.250
You're such a liar.

I don't care.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.166
Savannah is cutting
all our throats.

14:22.166 --> 14:24.291
Her sister's in labor.

14:24.291 --> 14:27.084
She's captain.
It is her job to be here.

14:27.084 --> 14:31.250
(Lewis) Ooh, you raised
some stone cold
in your house, Mr. V.

14:31.250 --> 14:33.792
Survival skills
for a wicked world, man.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.500
Uh, anyone know
where the ladies' room
is around here?

14:37.500 --> 14:39.125
It's through
the dressing rooms
to the left.

14:39.125 --> 14:42.667
- Hm. Would you mind
showing me?
- It's really just right--

14:42.667 --> 14:44.333
You know, 'cause I get
so turned around

14:44.333 --> 14:46.875
in these places, and I've got
no sense of direction

14:46.875 --> 14:48.166
you know. Hm?

14:48.166 --> 14:51.000
What are you, 12?
Jeez, Kelly.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.125
Here you go, little girl.
Here's your potty.

14:53.125 --> 14:54.917
Okay, what's wrong
with your throat?

14:54.917 --> 14:57.959
- Nothing.
- Sure about that?

14:57.959 --> 14:59.041
I'm fine.

15:00.333 --> 15:03.167
Ow!

15:03.167 --> 15:04.708
What are you thinking?

15:04.708 --> 15:06.375
Savannah is gone.

15:06.375 --> 15:08.500
There is no more back-up.
If I go down, we forfeit.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.500
A year's hard work
down the drain, Kelly.

15:10.500 --> 15:12.792
Yeah. You could
infect people.

15:12.792 --> 15:14.250
I'm on antibiotics.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.125
Promise you won't bust me?

15:19.125 --> 15:21.209
I'm not making
that promise.

15:21.209 --> 15:23.375
We perform in three hours
for three minutes.

15:23.375 --> 15:25.042
That's all I need, Kelly.

15:25.042 --> 15:26.458
Three hours
and three minutes

15:26.458 --> 15:30.084

in the world, okay?

No. Calm-calm down, alright.

I'll be right there.

15:53.125 --> 15:54.834
Hey, uh, can
I borrow your car?

15:54.834 --> 15:56.708
Yeah. Everything okay?

15:56.708 --> 15:57.792
I'm not sure.

15:57.792 --> 15:59.417
Just tell Alice
I'll be back in time

15:59.417 --> 16:01.458
for the performance, alright?

16:02.084 --> 16:03.291
Man!

- Mom!
- Oh, Savannah.

16:08.792 --> 16:11.458
[exhales sharply]
Where's Char? No way she's had
the baby yet, right?

16:11.458 --> 16:13.000
Please, please, please tell
me she didn't have the baby.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.542
No. No, you
did not miss it

16:14.542 --> 16:17.166
but Charlotte
is definitely in labor.

16:17.166 --> 16:19.625
Okay. Well, where's
her room? Let's go.

16:21.875 --> 16:23.542
Mom?

16:23.542 --> 16:25.625
What is it?

16:25.625 --> 16:29.208
The doctors have
told us to be prepared

16:29.208 --> 16:31.458
because sometimes
premature babies

16:31.458 --> 16:34.208
can have heart problems
during birth.

16:34.208 --> 16:39.125
If his little lungs
aren't fully developed, he..

16:39.125 --> 16:43.084

I could not do this alone.

And in spite of everything
he had done to this family

16:48.834 --> 16:51.542

your father was here.

you told me the story
about my birth?

17:07.084 --> 17:09.125
Twenty-nine hours
of labor, right?

17:09.125 --> 17:12.416
You were stubborn right
from the very beginnin'.

17:13.750 --> 17:15.250
It just means
that we've been through

17:15.250 --> 17:17.416
a tough birth together before.

17:19.208 --> 17:21.165
We can do it again.

- Yes.
- Let's pray.

from God to help Charlotte

kick it down.

It's a pretty thick door.

19:00.291 --> 19:03.209
Alice may not expect much
from a boyfriend

19:03.209 --> 19:05.917
but my standards
are a little higher.

19:05.917 --> 19:09.333
Boy.. What? We were never
boyfriend and girlfriend.

19:09.333 --> 19:10.917
We were just hanging out.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.291
We had sex, Lewis.

19:12.291 --> 19:14.500
You probably go around
screwing anything that moves.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.125
But sex is a big
commitment for me.

19:16.125 --> 19:17.917
And if you knew that
and did it anyway

19:17.917 --> 19:20.084
you suck and deserve
to miss Nationals.

19:20.084 --> 19:22.084

you're stupid

Okay.
Kathy?

19:33.209 --> 19:34.959
Come on now.
I'm sorry, alright?

19:34.959 --> 19:36.375
We can talk about this.

19:36.375 --> 19:38.125
And, you know,
we'll just work it all out.

19:38.125 --> 19:40.125
Just let me out, alright?

think twice before playing
