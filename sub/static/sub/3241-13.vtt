01:36.600 --> 01:38.568
I hope you kept yer powder dry.

01:40.120 --> 01:41.201
Misfire,

01:43.680 --> 01:45.921
and I'll ram that pistol down yer gullet.

01:51.280 --> 01:52.964
Well, there's only one way to find out.

02:01.520 --> 02:04.126
Taran, put yer gun down.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.521
I've found a scoundrel in here, Jenny.

02:06.920 --> 02:08.365
He's lucky I've got a steady hand,

02:08.479 --> 02:10.448
or he'd have a ball in his brain by now.

02:11.120 --> 02:13.964
That's no scoundrel, you fool.
That's my cousin.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.326
Jamie.

02:17.800 --> 02:18.881
Jamie MacTavish.

(CHUCKLES)

02:32.400 --> 02:33.481
My pardon to you.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.365
You'll understand my caution.

02:36.640 --> 02:38.608
I've never laid eyes on you, MacTavish.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.089
Jamie came for a visit.

02:41.160 --> 02:43.401
Walked in one fine day without warning,

02:43.480 --> 02:44.686
and with a wife on his arm.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.128
Jenny and Ian didn't know we were married.

02:49.040 --> 02:50.087
We surprised them.

02:50.280 --> 02:51.486
A Sassenach?

02:52.240 --> 02:53.287
For a bride?

02:53.960 --> 02:56.406
Nearly put a gun to his head myself
when I heard.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.680
But we've come to know Claire.
She's a decent woman.

02:59.960 --> 03:02.281
We don't mind her English-ness so much.

03:07.640 --> 03:09.802
Pleased to make yer acquaintance, mistress.

03:12.880 --> 03:14.211
I'm Taran MacQuarrie.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.890
You'll excuse my confusion.

03:17.400 --> 03:20.449
I thought yer husband
was intending to rob the place.

03:20.520 --> 03:23.729
(CHUCKLES) No, Taran,
we like to leave the robbing to you.

We dinna expect you till next month.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.120
MACQUARRIE: Aye, that was the plan.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.567
But I was pining for Jenny's rabbit stew.

03:37.800 --> 03:38.801
Uh...

03:38.920 --> 03:41.082
I took that sword of yours to the smithy.

03:42.080 --> 03:44.208
Had the nicks ground off the blade,

03:44.600 --> 03:46.921
and polished off the rust
with a bit of whale oil.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.604
You needn't have troubled yerself.

03:49.280 --> 03:50.327
It was no trouble.

03:55.480 --> 03:57.403
- Looks better than new.
- Aye.

(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

04:03.120 --> 04:04.360
You're welcome.

04:08.320 --> 04:11.608
So, my stomach's rumbling like thunder.

04:11.920 --> 04:14.685
Jenny, how about
you put some supper on the fire?

04:15.440 --> 04:17.488
You know yer way to the dining room, lads.

04:17.560 --> 04:19.084
MACQUARRIE: I do indeed.

04:27.880 --> 04:30.406
MacQuarrie's come.
Let's get supper ready.

04:31.760 --> 04:33.489
Are you daft, sister?

04:33.560 --> 04:36.006
- Welcoming the watch into our home.
- Agh, hold yer tongue.

04:36.080 --> 04:37.923
It's not like we had a choice, now, is it?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.729
IAN: It's only for a couple of days.

04:39.840 --> 04:41.490
MacQuarrie's a decent fellow.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.125
And you fixed his sword for him.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.521
Maybe you'd like to polish his boots as well.

04:45.600 --> 04:48.126
I did the man a favor, that's all.

04:48.440 --> 04:51.125
They're criminals,
out to line their own pockets.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.362
IAN: The money we pay is for protection

04:53.480 --> 04:56.450
from the Redcoats and other raiding clans.

04:56.520 --> 04:59.205
They look out for us, Jamie, and our tenants.

04:59.280 --> 05:01.203
And what about the price on my head?

05:01.320 --> 05:04.051
If the watch knew, they'd turn me over
to the Redcoats in a heartbeat.

05:04.120 --> 05:05.770
That's why we're going to fill their bellies,

05:05.840 --> 05:06.887
give them a place to sleep,

05:06.960 --> 05:09.247
and you, cousin,
are going to keep yer wits about you

05:09.320 --> 05:10.606
until they've moved on.

05:13.120 --> 05:14.884
How often do these men come around?

05:15.080 --> 05:17.560
Every few months for nigh on two years now.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.130
I never would have agreed to this.

05:19.200 --> 05:22.204
But you weren't here, now,
were you, Jamie MacTavish?

05:22.280 --> 05:25.124

on Jenny and me?

05:47.920 --> 05:49.160
Well, it has.

05:49.520 --> 05:51.966
But it was our burden to bear.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.721
Aye, Jenny hides the good stuff away
when we come,

06:52.440 --> 06:53.805
Na h-Innse Gall.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.962
Aye, you don't sound like an islander.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.004
Well, Jamie spent time in France

06:58.080 --> 07:00.048
fighting with the French army with Ian.

07:00.760 --> 07:03.001
Perhaps that's what's influenced his accent.

07:03.240 --> 07:04.571
MACQUARRIE: Did you, now?

07:04.880 --> 07:07.929
I did some soldiering myself
with the French in Austria.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.729
Were you posted in Spain with Ian?

07:10.960 --> 07:12.086
Aye.

07:13.280 --> 07:14.964
Aye, the border mostly.

07:15.160 --> 07:17.606
We got separated during a battle.

I thought he'd died on the field.

into the guns after that first volley

07:58.680 --> 07:59.761

puts a good end to the second.

15:37.520 --> 15:38.646
Oh. (LAUGHS)

15:40.840 --> 15:42.490
Jamie, have you no sense?

15:42.560 --> 15:44.289
Look what you've done to your auntie's skirt.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.771
It's all right. I don't mind.

15:45.880 --> 15:47.689
Well, I mind. Mrs. Crook.

15:47.800 --> 15:50.406
I'll take him back to the house
for a bit of bread and honey.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.281
(LAUGHING)

15:55.960 --> 15:59.328
Be nice to get some chores done
without a bairn under my feet.

15:59.640 --> 16:02.530
Some days I can scarce go to the privy alone.

16:03.440 --> 16:06.922
But soon he'll have a wee brother
to play with. (CHUCKLES)

16:07.720 --> 16:09.563
How do you know it's not a sister?

16:09.640 --> 16:12.962
Well, I've had no morning sickness
and a taste for salty food,

16:13.040 --> 16:16.169
and I'm carrying low, same as Wee Jamie.

16:17.160 --> 16:18.366
It's a boy, all right.

16:19.680 --> 16:20.886
You have siblings?

16:21.600 --> 16:23.523
No, I'm an only child.

16:25.160 --> 16:28.642
Well, it's good for a man to have a brother.

16:29.840 --> 16:33.162
Jamie was only eight
when we lost Willie to smallpox.

16:33.880 --> 16:36.087
He said Ian's been like a brother to him.

16:36.160 --> 16:37.764
Aye, he is.

16:37.840 --> 16:39.968
The two of them were like one
after Willie died,

16:40.040 --> 16:41.246
especially in a fight.

16:41.680 --> 16:43.125
Old John, Ian's father,

16:43.200 --> 16:46.522
used to tell Ian his job
was to guard his chief's weaker side.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.081
And he did.

16:48.160 --> 16:50.003
When Jamie and Ian
stood shoulder to shoulder,

16:50.080 --> 16:52.811
there was no one who could
take the pair of them down.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.127
(GASPS)

16:56.440 --> 16:57.601
Jenny.

16:58.360 --> 16:59.646
What's wrong?

17:01.360 --> 17:02.805
My waters have broken.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.405
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

17:05.160 --> 17:06.445
Looks like this laddie's on his way.

17:06.520 --> 17:08.249
All right. Let's get you inside.

17:26.880 --> 17:30.487
Jenny, it feels to me
that this baby is breech.

17:32.600 --> 17:33.806
Well. (SIGHS)

17:35.080 --> 17:36.923
He's in the wrong position.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.049
The head should be down here,
but it's still up here.

17:40.440 --> 17:41.601
He's a footling, then?

17:43.160 --> 17:44.491
Yes, I suppose.

17:46.040 --> 17:47.929
We're going to have to turn him.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.170
I'm going to need you to lie on your side,

17:50.240 --> 17:51.685
and then I'll have to palpate the belly.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.401
Here.

17:57.440 --> 17:59.488
You know about babies and such, then?

17:59.680 --> 18:01.045
I've seen childbirth.

18:21.720 --> 18:23.927
You've not yet been
with child yourself, then?

18:24.760 --> 18:25.921
No, I haven't.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.209
Grannie MacNab says

18:28.280 --> 18:32.524
ye should drink a tea
of raspberry leaves and rosehips

18:32.600 --> 18:34.489
when the moon is waxing.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.406
(SIGHS)

18:36.480 --> 18:39.404
That and a bit of lady's mantle
with a raw egg beaten up in it.

18:49.640 --> 18:50.641
(SIGHS)

18:56.160 --> 18:57.685
It's not working, is it?

19:00.640 --> 19:01.880
No, it isn't.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.162
He's determined to land on his feet.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.090
He's a stubborn one.

19:07.160 --> 19:08.764
Definitely has Fraser in him.

19:16.560 --> 19:17.925
We should go get Ian.

19:18.480 --> 19:19.527
He should know what's going on.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.921
I'll not tell him anything
and neither will you.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.570
No point in worrying the man.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.685
Tell him the bairn's coming, nothing else.

19:53.640 --> 19:55.210
Making yerself comfortable?

19:56.360 --> 19:58.362
I was wondering when you'd seek me out.

20:00.760 --> 20:02.364
We have a lot to talk about.

20:02.720 --> 20:03.960
Then let's talk.

20:05.880 --> 20:07.120
This,

20:08.400 --> 20:09.890
this is all yours.

20:13.720 --> 20:14.846
Isn't it?

20:16.720 --> 20:19.883
Yeah, I saw the name "Fraser"
carved in the lintel.

20:22.560 --> 20:23.721
Who's Jenny to you?

20:26.920 --> 20:29.082
Very well. Don't tell me.

20:31.720 --> 20:33.085
She's bonny.

20:37.280 --> 20:38.725
So's your bride.

20:39.800 --> 20:42.804
Yeah. They speak about the luck of the Irish.

20:44.040 --> 20:48.204
But you, Jamie Fraser, you're the lucky man.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.009
What do you want, Horrocks?

20:52.240 --> 20:53.844
To sail to the colonies.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.241
Boston, I fancy.

20:57.360 --> 21:00.648
Then go. Scotland won't miss you.

21:02.440 --> 21:04.522
I'm gonna need money for my venture.

21:06.600 --> 21:10.400
You'll have plenty in your pockets after
the raid on the rent party.

21:10.760 --> 21:12.603
It's a start, but not much of one,

21:12.680 --> 21:14.967
not after I divvy the pot with the others.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.130
(SCOFFS) My thinking was

21:18.520 --> 21:20.966
maybe you'd be willing to help a fellow.

21:21.480 --> 21:24.609
Same way as I'm helping you
by keeping my mouth shut.

21:25.160 --> 21:27.686
- For a price, I'm sure.
- You're a canny lad.

21:29.040 --> 21:30.405
But you put up some money now,

21:30.480 --> 21:33.165
and I swear, you'll not see my face again.

21:42.320 --> 21:43.446
How much?

21:50.160 --> 21:51.969
He's dropped now. I can feel it.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.567
All right. We just have to wait.

22:00.120 --> 22:02.600
Tell me what it's like, being pregnant.

22:04.920 --> 22:07.241
Well, it's no romp in the heather.
Can't you see my face?

22:07.320 --> 22:09.402
I know. Come on. Tell me.

22:16.520 --> 22:17.726
Well, uh...

22:20.000 --> 22:24.483
In the early days,
it's just a bit like wind in yer belly.

22:25.400 --> 22:28.210
Later, you start to feel the child move.

22:28.640 --> 22:33.248
And it's like a fish on a line,
just a quick tug,

22:33.320 --> 22:36.483
and then gone so soon,
you're not sure you felt it.

22:38.800 --> 22:41.371
They sleep for hours at a time.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.171
(EXHALES)

22:43.240 --> 22:45.402
Sometimes when there's been no movement,

22:45.480 --> 22:46.845
you fear they've died.

22:47.280 --> 22:49.806
And then you try to wake them,

22:49.880 --> 22:51.564
and when they kick again...

22:52.720 --> 22:53.926
(SOFT GRUNT)

22:55.040 --> 22:56.280
You get down on yer knees

22:56.360 --> 22:59.887
and promise God anything
he asks if he'll just keep them safe.

23:01.120 --> 23:02.201
Ooh.

23:04.720 --> 23:06.404
(GRUNTS)

23:08.920 --> 23:10.126
Just breathe.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.968
And towards the end,

23:17.280 --> 23:19.169
when the child moves a lot.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.490
(EXHALES)

23:21.560 --> 23:25.042
It's a feeling like when yer man's inside you.

23:27.760 --> 23:30.286
When he comes to you deep

23:30.360 --> 23:34.888
and pours himself inside you
and that throbbing begins.

23:37.760 --> 23:39.091
Feels like that,

23:39.720 --> 23:41.848
only much bigger, like...

23:43.160 --> 23:45.686
Like it's him you've taken into you instead.

23:50.920 --> 23:53.366
That's what they want sometimes, you know.

23:54.840 --> 23:56.569
They want to come back.

24:06.680 --> 24:07.966
(SIGHS)

24:09.600 --> 24:11.204
MRS. CROOK: Mistress?

24:11.280 --> 24:12.930
There's word from the village.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.209
The midwife was called away
to tend to a relative who's taken ill.

24:31.040 --> 24:32.405
It's all right.

24:33.520 --> 24:35.966
It is possible to deliver a breech baby.

24:36.280 --> 24:38.681
I'm going to have to reach inside
and guide it out.

24:42.600 --> 24:46.082
All right, but you'll be fetching me
a good stiff dram before we start.

24:46.160 --> 24:48.003
In that case,
the baby will likely be drunk, too.

24:48.080 --> 24:50.481
Then he'll come into the world a true Scot.

24:52.120 --> 24:53.201
All right.

24:57.200 --> 24:59.089
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

24:59.160 --> 25:01.527
Ever since they got here,
you have the look on your face

25:01.600 --> 25:03.523
like you've got a thistle stuck up your arse.

25:03.600 --> 25:04.761
You're provoking them.

25:04.840 --> 25:06.968
They burned hay we need for winter.

25:09.160 --> 25:10.810
You'd have me turn the other cheek?

25:11.320 --> 25:14.244
That's why you've got two cheeks,
you limmer.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.528
Jenny hates the very bones of them.

25:22.160 --> 25:23.764
I canna understand why you don't.

25:25.600 --> 25:28.524
MacQuarrie could take
more from the estate than he does.

25:29.280 --> 25:31.169
Just ask the MacIntoshes.

25:31.240 --> 25:32.685
He's been easy on us.

25:34.840 --> 25:36.569
So you're boon companions with him.

25:36.840 --> 25:38.524
Aye, so I am.

25:39.760 --> 25:41.967
And if you want to ken the truth of it,

25:42.040 --> 25:43.804
I look forward to his visits.

25:44.360 --> 25:47.489
To drink whiskey with a man
who doesna look on me with pity,

25:48.280 --> 25:50.044
as if I'm some lame cur.

25:50.560 --> 25:54.042
Maybe I favor him
because he's a soldier or because...

25:56.240 --> 25:57.765
(SIGHS)

25:57.840 --> 25:59.604
Because he reminds me of you.

26:03.840 --> 26:06.810
And because he protects us
from the Redcoats.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.925
He pays them to stay away,

26:09.000 --> 26:10.923
and when they don't, he fights them.

26:12.280 --> 26:14.123
You pay one devil
to protect you from another.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.248
I'm not proud of it, but there it is.

26:21.240 --> 26:24.767
What happened here
with Jenny never will again.

26:26.040 --> 26:29.010
But no man can stand up
to that monster Randall alone.

26:29.080 --> 26:31.606
Not you, not me. It takes an army.

26:32.840 --> 26:34.729
The watch is our army now.

26:40.680 --> 26:42.125
What's the matter?

26:47.680 --> 26:52.447
That new man, Horrocks.
I've met him before.

26:52.960 --> 26:54.803
He knows about the price on my head.

26:55.200 --> 26:57.168
He wants money to keep quiet.

26:57.640 --> 26:58.971
What are you going to do?

27:02.680 --> 27:03.966
I dinna ken.

27:06.040 --> 27:08.520
Jenny told me about
a small sum your father left.

27:08.600 --> 27:10.364
It's ferreted away in a nook in the broch.

27:10.480 --> 27:11.527
I canna use that money.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.568
Half of it's yours by right.

27:13.640 --> 27:16.530
- If Jenny knew about this...
- She doesn't know about it.

27:18.840 --> 27:20.444
And I want it kept that way.

27:21.800 --> 27:24.724
- I won't be taking that money.
- Yes, you will.

27:26.240 --> 27:28.049
It's what she would want.

27:28.120 --> 27:29.849
It's what I want.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.729
That money was meant for you,

27:33.800 --> 27:35.325
for our sons and daughters.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.926
I wanted to fill this house with our children,

27:39.000 --> 27:40.968
hand down the good Fraser name.

27:43.400 --> 27:44.845
I've let you down, Claire.

28:01.520 --> 28:03.443
It's me that's let you down.

28:11.800 --> 28:16.044
The truth is, I may never give you
a son as beautiful as little Jamie.

28:18.840 --> 28:19.887
(SNIFFLES)

28:19.960 --> 28:22.327
I don't think I can have children.

28:27.160 --> 28:29.208
I tried before I met you.

28:33.800 --> 28:34.881
With Frank.

28:42.680 --> 28:46.287
(SOBS) I should have told you
before we were married,

28:47.360 --> 28:49.442
but I never counted on loving you,

28:51.040 --> 28:53.008
much less having children with you.

28:56.400 --> 28:57.481
(SOBS)

I'm so sorry.

29:16.280 --> 29:18.009
Perhaps it's for the best.

29:24.720 --> 29:26.006
There's...

29:26.080 --> 29:28.287
There's so many things that can go wrong.

29:29.480 --> 29:31.528
I wouldn't want anything to happen to you.

29:32.440 --> 29:34.204
Or for you to suffer.

29:36.720 --> 29:38.051
I wouldn't mind the pain.

29:38.120 --> 29:39.167
I would.

29:40.120 --> 29:41.645
I can bear pain myself,

29:43.000 --> 29:45.128
but I couldna bear yours.

29:48.880 --> 29:51.406
That would take more strength than I have.

30:02.320 --> 30:04.004
I shouldna keep you from Jenny.

30:04.800 --> 30:06.131
Of course. (SNIFFLES)

30:09.520 --> 30:10.806
Don't worry.

30:11.040 --> 30:12.485
She'll be fine.

30:13.960 --> 30:15.200
I'll make sure of it.

Oh. Ho-ho.

31:08.280 --> 31:09.520
I must thank you.

31:10.520 --> 31:11.806
You've been generous.

31:13.200 --> 31:15.282
- Then we're done here.
- Yeah.

31:15.760 --> 31:17.444
There's just one small concern.

31:19.480 --> 31:20.606
I thought there might be.

31:20.680 --> 31:23.365
This is enough for safe passage
to the colonies.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.890
But then there's the matter
of making a living when I'm there.

31:26.960 --> 31:29.770

Surely you can raise
the rents of your tenants, huh?

An Irishman’s never drunk.

32:02.600 --> 32:04.887
As long as he can hold on
to one blade of grass,

32:05.960 --> 32:07.928
he'll not fall off the face of the earth.

32:08.640 --> 32:10.768
I do partake from time to time,

32:10.840 --> 32:12.205
and my tongue gets loose.

32:13.080 --> 32:14.969
Who knows what I might say?

32:15.760 --> 32:18.240
I'm a danger to myself, and others.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.531
Like your kith and kin.

32:22.400 --> 32:23.970
You leave my kin out of this.

32:26.440 --> 32:29.808
The British Army don't take kindly
to those who harbor outlaws.

32:31.240 --> 32:33.686
Prison's no place for decent folk.

33:17.960 --> 33:19.166
Although if you hadn't done it,

33:20.640 --> 33:22.051
I would've done it myself.

33:22.120 --> 33:25.010
The man was an absconder,
a traitor and a thief.

33:25.560 --> 33:28.450
He wasna worthy of the watch,
nor even a Redcoat.

33:29.520 --> 33:32.444

Remember,

34:08.639 --> 34:10.005
we used to argue

34:11.040 --> 34:12.724
which was the bigger sin,

34:16.159 --> 34:18.731
fornication or killing.

Our brother Willie carved that

35:44.760 --> 35:47.331
I found it recently.
I meant to give it to him.

35:49.800 --> 35:50.847
"Sawny."

35:52.360 --> 35:53.771
It's a pet name.

35:54.120 --> 35:56.726
It's a play on the Gaelic
for his second name, Alexander.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.207
It's what Willie used to call Jamie.

36:02.040 --> 36:04.168
I know he'd want him to have it.

36:14.680 --> 36:16.682
Willie's buried out there,

36:17.680 --> 36:19.284

Well, there's still no sign
of our friend Mr. Horrocks,

38:32.600 --> 38:34.489
which is a wee bit of a puzzle.

38:35.840 --> 38:37.171
It is a puzzle.

38:40.160 --> 38:43.164
Well, his horse is just outside,

38:43.600 --> 38:45.841
so he can't have gone far,

38:46.480 --> 38:49.211
given that the man
would barely walk 10 steps to pish,

38:49.280 --> 38:51.089
much less wander away.

38:51.920 --> 38:53.001
Now,

38:54.640 --> 38:57.007
I have a fair knowledge of mathematics.

38:57.560 --> 38:59.005
Three men go out,

38:59.920 --> 39:01.331
two men come in.

39:06.360 --> 39:10.365
If I add to that the fact
that you two knew each other

39:11.320 --> 39:13.527
and you hid it from me,

39:19.680 --> 39:21.523
that doesn't tally up.

39:29.840 --> 39:31.046
I don't get yer meaning.

39:35.280 --> 39:36.691
Why'd you kill him?

- Let me explain.
- I'm a wanted man.

39:58.200 --> 39:59.804
There's a price on my head.

40:00.560 --> 40:02.403
Ten pounds, sterling.

40:04.160 --> 40:05.889
Likely twice that now.

40:08.240 --> 40:09.605
Horrocks knew it.

40:10.840 --> 40:13.207
He threatened me and my family.

40:15.840 --> 40:16.921
So...

40:22.480 --> 40:24.084
Iran him through.

40:33.880 --> 40:35.120
Good.

40:38.240 --> 40:40.322
I never liked the Irish bastard.

We're raiding the Chisholms today,
and now I'm a man short.

40:57.680 --> 41:01.127
And I could do with a tall, strong Scotsman

41:02.480 --> 41:04.209
who's swift with a sword.

she's got the Fraser eyes.

51:15.800 --> 51:18.280
Here, Mrs. Crook will put her down for a nap.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.082
- Mrs. Crook.
- Yes, mistress?

51:30.560 --> 51:32.050
- (BABY FUSSING)
- Shh.

51:41.920 --> 51:44.321
You look good with a wee yin in yer arms.

51:44.920 --> 51:46.922
You'll be holding yer own soon enough.

51:47.040 --> 51:48.280
(SOFT GRUNT)

51:49.120 --> 51:50.929
I don't know that I Will.

51:53.520 --> 51:55.602
Listen to me, Claire Fraser.

51:56.080 --> 51:59.527
Every day for four years,
I stared at that very road.

52:01.320 --> 52:02.560
He will come home.

52:02.680 --> 52:03.966
He always does.

52:12.360 --> 52:15.489
These belonged to my mother.

52:17.240 --> 52:19.971
You're tall and queenly, like she was.

52:20.880 --> 52:23.167
The lady of Lallybroch should have them.

52:30.320 --> 52:31.606
They're gorgeous.

52:33.440 --> 52:34.805
Really, they are.

52:37.480 --> 52:38.891
So very

52:41.000 --> 52:42.001
unique.

52:44.320 --> 52:46.482
Someone gave them to her as a wedding gift.

52:46.680 --> 52:48.250
She never would say who.

52:48.680 --> 52:51.809
My father used to tease her
about her admirer,

52:52.240 --> 52:56.006
but she just smiled like a cat
that's had cream for its supper.

53:05.400 --> 53:06.765
(DOG BARKING)

53:10.560 --> 53:11.891
(IAN GRUNTING)

53:13.520 --> 53:14.646
(DOG BARKING)

53:41.840 --> 53:43.842
Ian, you're hurt.

53:44.040 --> 53:45.485
IAN: I'm all right.

53:45.880 --> 53:47.962
I lost my horse and my leg in the fight.

53:51.360 --> 53:52.725
Where's Jamie?

53:53.680 --> 53:55.170
(GRUNTS) We were ambushed.

53:56.240 --> 53:58.368
The Redcoats were waiting.
They knew we were coming.

53:58.440 --> 54:00.010
Horrocks.

54:00.080 --> 54:02.401
That dirty bastard
must've cut a deal with them.

54:03.000 --> 54:04.161
I don't understand.

54:04.240 --> 54:06.527
Delivering the watch to buy his freedom.

54:07.120 --> 54:09.088
The other lads were killed outright.

54:10.920 --> 54:12.729
I fetched Murray home.

54:12.920 --> 54:14.968
'Twas the least I could do.

54:18.920 --> 54:20.729
Where is Jamie?

54:20.800 --> 54:22.609
MacQuarrie was wounded.

54:23.440 --> 54:24.805
Jamie wouldn't leave him behind.

54:24.880 --> 54:26.450
Was Jamie hurt?

54:26.760 --> 54:28.603
Not that I saw.

54:28.920 --> 54:30.410
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

54:30.480 --> 54:32.244
But they took him.

54:34.760 --> 54:36.728
The Redcoats have him.

54:39.500 --> 54:47.500
