00:03.420 --> 00:06.992
("Wishing On A Star"
by Miriam Stockley)

00:16.220 --> 00:17.460
I'm wishing

00:17.510 --> 00:21.059
On a star

00:22.730 --> 00:25.096
To follow where you

00:25.150 --> 00:28.813
Are

00:30.070 --> 00:30.980
I'm wishing

00:31.030 --> 00:34.989
On a dream

00:36.450 --> 00:38.520
To follow what it

00:38.580 --> 00:42.152
Means

00:43.620 --> 00:45.451
And 1'” wish on all the

00:45.500 --> 00:48.162
Rainbows

00:48.210 --> 00:50.667
That I see

00:50.710 --> 00:53.838
I wish on all the people

00:53.880 --> 00:55.882
Who

00:55.930 --> 00:59.058
Really dream

01:07.650 --> 01:09.470
I'm wishing on a

01:09.520 --> 01:13.980
Star

01:14.030 --> 01:16.021
To follow

01:16.070 --> 01:20.780
Where you are

01:25.710 --> 01:28.873
- Dear All, you must be
wondering where I have been

01:28.920 --> 01:31.332
these last few days.

01:31.380 --> 01:34.122
I have been laid low
with a sprained ankle,

01:34.170 --> 01:36.047
and I'm staying in the
Royal Hunting Lodge

01:36.090 --> 01:38.138
in the Disenchanted Forest.

01:38.180 --> 01:40.136
Do carry on with the
coronation plans,

01:40.180 --> 01:41.966
and rest assured I will be back

01:42.010 --> 01:44.137
in plenty of time
for the big day.

01:44.180 --> 01:45.977
Lots of love, Prince Wendell.

01:46.020 --> 01:48.011
- Thank goodness for that.

01:48.060 --> 01:50.642
- That explains it.

01:50.690 --> 01:53.523
- That explains nothing.

01:55.070 --> 01:56.480
to the Troll King crisis?

01:56.530 --> 01:58.942
- Well, perhaps he
hasn't heard about it.

01:58.990 --> 02:01.117
A twisted ankle can
be excrucratlng.

02:01.160 --> 02:02.866
- The Troll King has
challenged Wendell

02:02.910 --> 02:04.446
to face him in combat.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.866
Meanwhile, he's been killing
4th Kingdom citizens,

02:06.910 --> 02:08.366
and nothing is
being done about it.

02:08.420 --> 02:10.240
- We need a plan.

02:10.290 --> 02:11.951
- We have a plan.

02:14.380 --> 02:16.666
My seating plan.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.711
The ceremony is barely
three weeks away.

02:18.760 --> 02:20.637
I need the prince for a fitting,

02:20.680 --> 02:22.750
and I need people to
at least commit to

02:22.810 --> 02:25.096
a basic color scheme.

02:25.140 --> 02:26.971
- I'm worried about Wendell.

02:27.020 --> 02:28.510
I shall go to the hunting lodge

02:28.560 --> 02:30.221
by the fastest steed
in the kingdom,

02:30.270 --> 02:32.226
and tell him of the
Troll King's challenge.

02:32.270 --> 02:34.226
- Jolly good idea.

02:35.440 --> 02:37.180
- One further thing,

02:37.240 --> 02:38.525
the Queen is still at large.

02:38.570 --> 02:40.481
She has spies everywhere.

02:40.530 --> 02:41.815
Nothing that is said here

02:41.870 --> 02:43.986
must go beyond
this room. Agreed?

02:44.030 --> 02:45.281
- Agreed.

02:51.380 --> 02:53.951
We _must consider
military options.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.412
Otherwise, we will be
perceived as being spineless

02:56.460 --> 02:57.961
in Wendell's absence.

02:58.010 --> 03:00.422
- Would it help to
calm people if we--

03:00.470 --> 03:02.256
- Summon my Huntsman.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.971
Oh, we have problems.

03:13.900 --> 03:17.188
(horns solemnly blaring)

03:24.530 --> 03:27.613
Wendell's council doesn't
believe my letter.

03:27.660 --> 03:30.743
They have sent a man to
Wendell's hunting lodge.

03:30.790 --> 03:32.621
He must not return.

03:32.670 --> 03:34.035
- It will be done.

03:35.250 --> 03:36.581
- Yeah, if you were kidnapped

03:36.630 --> 03:39.212
it would've been all
right, but, Virginia.

03:39.260 --> 03:41.922
Oh, have I lost
my one true love?

03:41.970 --> 03:42.959
- Oh, please.

03:43.010 --> 03:44.216
Stop it with the one
true love, all right?

03:44.260 --> 03:45.750
You're some grubby ex-con.

03:45.800 --> 03:46.960
You've been nothin' but
trouble smce we met you.

03:47.010 --> 03:48.056
- Don't talk to me like that!

03:48.100 --> 03:49.670
I'll bite you in a minute!

03:49.730 --> 03:50.970
- You wanna dance with me?

03:51.020 --> 03:52.089
Because I've had just
about enough. All right?

03:52.140 --> 03:53.050
- Sh, sh, sh.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.010
Listen.

03:54.060 --> 03:55.641
(something whizzes by very fast)

04:02.240 --> 04:03.605
- Halt.

04:05.160 --> 04:06.616
Who approaches?

04:08.950 --> 04:10.406
- Forgive us, noble Woodsman,

04:10.450 --> 04:14.034
but have you seen a gorgeous
girl with very long hair?

04:14.080 --> 04:17.868
- I haven't seen
anything. I'm blind.

04:20.090 --> 04:21.546
- A blind Woodsman?

04:21.590 --> 04:24.047
- Have you ever
seen a tree move?

04:25.180 --> 04:26.135
- Tony?

04:26.180 --> 04:26.839
- What?

04:26.890 --> 04:28.505
- Look at his ax?

04:28.560 --> 04:30.516
Is that ax, by any
remote chance,

04:30.560 --> 04:33.097
the Magic Ax that
cuts through anything?

04:33.140 --> 04:34.767
- Could be.

04:34.810 --> 04:36.437
- Oh! How much do
you want for It?

04:36.480 --> 04:37.640
- Yeah, how much?

04:37.690 --> 04:40.147
- Oh, you can have my magic ax,

04:40.190 --> 04:42.397
if you can guess my name.

04:42.440 --> 04:44.442
But your friend must
kneel by this block,

04:44.490 --> 04:46.731
and if you haven't
found my name out

04:46.780 --> 04:49.738
by the time I've
chopped all these logs

04:49.790 --> 04:52.111
into firewood,

04:52.160 --> 04:54.037
I will have his head.

04:55.830 --> 04:57.991
- What is it with you people?

04:58.040 --> 05:00.873
What kind of twisted
upbringing did you have?

05:00.920 --> 05:02.046
You know why can't you just say,

05:02.090 --> 05:03.159
Oh, that'll be a
hundred gold coins?

05:03.220 --> 05:04.369
Why does it always have to be,

05:04.430 --> 05:06.045
No, not unless you
lay a magic egg,

05:06.090 --> 05:08.251
or count the hairs
on a giant's ass?

05:08.300 --> 05:11.463
- Do you want the
ax, or don't you?

05:11.520 --> 05:13.306
- Oh, let's just carry
on looking for Virginia.

05:13.350 --> 05:14.339
- Oh!

05:14.390 --> 05:15.687
- What?

05:15.730 --> 05:16.936
- I know this.
- [Wolf] No.

05:16.980 --> 05:18.720
- It's all right. It's
all right. It's all right.

05:18.770 --> 05:19.850
We accept.

05:19.900 --> 05:21.060
- Oh no, don't
accept on my behalf

05:21.110 --> 05:21.895
- No, no, it's fine.

05:21.940 --> 05:22.895
- N0-—

05:22.940 --> 05:25.522
- It's okay, it's okay.
I swear. It's okay.

05:25.570 --> 05:29.825
- Very well, lay your
head on the block

05:29.870 --> 05:31.986
while your friend guesses.

05:32.040 --> 05:32.938
- Just for Virginia.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.240
- Yes, I got it, don't worry.

05:34.290 --> 05:35.951
- Okay.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.991
Oh!

05:38.040 --> 05:39.530
- Just to make you secure.

05:39.590 --> 05:41.490
- I know this_. Don't
worry about It at all.

05:41.550 --> 05:44.257
_All
right,
Mr.
ave-To-Look-But-I-Can-Chop-Wood,

05:44.300 --> 05:46.791
your name is Rumpelstiltskin.

05:46.840 --> 05:47.625
- No.

05:49.090 --> 05:51.001
- Oh, whoa.

05:51.060 --> 05:52.630
- I said, Rumpelstiltskin.

05:52.680 --> 05:54.170
- That's not is name.

05:54.220 --> 05:55.847
- Guess again.

05:55.890 --> 05:58.188
- Oh, Rumpelstiltskin Jr.

05:58.230 --> 05:59.766
Rumpelstiltskin the 4th.

05:59.810 --> 06:01.107
- No.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.778
- Does it have a Rumpel in it?

06:04.820 --> 06:06.811
- Please let me go. I'm
not involved in this. I--

06:06.860 --> 06:07.986
- Where's the dog?

06:09.870 --> 06:12.077
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

06:12.120 --> 06:14.111
- Don't make me ask again.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.956
- I think he's dead.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.912
- I think you're lying.

06:20.960 --> 06:23.872
And you're not
lying. Is he hurt?

06:23.920 --> 06:26.582
You were dragging
something on wheels,

06:26.630 --> 06:29.929
yet the tracks were too deep
for the weight of just a dog.

06:31.220 --> 06:33.097
What about the others?

06:33.140 --> 06:36.052
Will they come looking for you?

06:36.100 --> 06:39.092
- They don't give
a damn about me.

06:39.140 --> 06:41.893
- So they will come.

06:41.940 --> 06:44.898
Will they have any weapons?

06:44.940 --> 06:45.850
- Yes.

06:47.650 --> 06:49.026
- No weapons.

06:50.700 --> 06:54.238
- Uh, Tom? Uh,
Dick, uh, Van Dyke?

06:54.280 --> 06:55.781
- Cold.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.991
- Uh, oh, oh, Elvis?

07:00.040 --> 07:01.166
- Elvis.

07:02.420 --> 07:05.332
- Frankie? John?
Paul? George? Ringo?

07:05.380 --> 07:06.335
- Ringo!

07:06.380 --> 07:07.916
- Colder. Way off.

07:09.550 --> 07:11.506
- Well, come on, look, look,
look, just give me a clue.

07:11.550 --> 07:12.847
- Yeah, give him a clue.

07:12.890 --> 07:14.005
- What kind of fun could
it be just to kill him?

07:14.050 --> 07:14.926
- Yeah.

07:14.970 --> 07:16.551
- Quite a lot of fun, actually.

07:16.600 --> 07:21.185
In fact, you could say that is
the reason for my existence.

07:23.940 --> 07:27.524
(dramatic instrumental music)

07:57.010 --> 07:57.886
- Sit.

08:00.890 --> 08:03.097
I was born here in this forest.

08:05.110 --> 08:09.149
When I first saw the Queen,
I was still a forester.

08:09.190 --> 08:11.067
She came to my village.

08:11.110 --> 08:15.194
She stopped her hunting
party to water the horses,

08:15.240 --> 08:18.232
then she called me forward.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.906
She showed me this.

08:20.950 --> 08:25.819
She said, "When this
crossbow is fi red,

08:25.880 --> 08:29.452
"the bold will not stop
until it hits the heart

08:29.510 --> 08:33.469
"of a living being.
It cannot miss."

08:33.510 --> 08:37.219
So, I said, "What must I do

08:37.260 --> 08:39.922
"to win this magic crossbow?"

08:39.970 --> 08:44.054
And she said, "Just
close your eyes,

08:44.100 --> 08:47.763
"fire wherever you wish,
and it will be yours."

08:49.980 --> 08:51.231
So, I did.

08:52.990 --> 08:55.561
The bolt the bow like gossamer,

08:55.610 --> 08:58.078
and sped a mile
through the trees,

08:58.120 --> 09:00.862
then killed a child
who was playing.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.530
I remember the Queen's face

09:07.210 --> 09:10.998
as I pulled the bolt
from my son's heart.

09:12.130 --> 09:16.965
And she said, "You
will be my Huntsman."

09:18.260 --> 09:22.094
So, you understand
the hunt is my purpose

09:22.140 --> 09:23.346
and only pleasure.

09:23.390 --> 09:26.302
I have no interest in mercy.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.812
- No! Well, how do we know you're
not lying about your name?

09:29.860 --> 09:31.066
- Hey, that's right.
- [Wolf] Yeah.

09:31.110 --> 09:32.145
- I could have said it already.

09:32.190 --> 09:35.148
- You haven't guessed my
name, not by a long way.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.064
- Long way.

09:36.110 --> 09:38.738
- My name is in my hat.

09:45.910 --> 09:48.492
I may be blind, but my
hearing is excellent.

09:48.540 --> 09:52.089
Move any closer and I chop
your friend's head off.

09:53.550 --> 09:55.336
- You're a sick pervert, huh?
- [Wolf] Sick pervert.

09:55.380 --> 09:56.870
- You've done this
before, haven't you?

09:56.930 --> 09:58.545
- Hundreds of times.

09:58.590 --> 10:01.343
- And, uh, approximately
what was the percentage

10:01.390 --> 10:02.846
of correct guesses?

10:02.890 --> 10:05.768
- No one has ever guessed.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.016
- Ow!

10:11.650 --> 10:15.393
(dramatic instrumental music)

10:30.040 --> 10:32.088
Your Majesty, are you there?

10:37.670 --> 10:38.876
Hello?

10:50.310 --> 10:52.107
Is anyone there?

10:52.150 --> 10:55.062
(suspenseful instrumental music)

10:56.900 --> 10:58.697
Prince Wendell?

11:10.040 --> 11:11.996
- Who is this Queen?

11:12.040 --> 11:13.086
HOW can YOU serve someone

11:13.130 --> 11:15.086
that made you kill your own son?

11:15.130 --> 11:17.416
- It was my destiny
to kill my son.

11:17.460 --> 11:19.712
It was her destiny to ask me.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.045
- You're crazy.

11:21.090 --> 11:23.923
Everybody in this
whole place is crazy!

11:23.970 --> 11:25.961
- Whatever is meant
to happen will happen,

11:26.010 --> 11:27.420
no matter what we do.

11:27.470 --> 11:29.882
It is my destiny
to kill you now.

11:29.940 --> 11:33.899
(dramatic, sinister
instrumental music)

11:36.270 --> 11:37.680
(whimpers)

11:37.730 --> 11:38.890
Who are you?

11:38.940 --> 11:41.147
- I'm nobody, I
swear I'm nobody.

11:43.530 --> 11:46.328
- I will kill you.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.457
(tinkling from bell)

11:54.670 --> 11:57.241
I have a little
business to attend to.

11:57.300 --> 12:00.258
We _will continue our
discussmn later.

12:01.970 --> 12:03.130
- The Mad Axman?

12:03.180 --> 12:04.420
(growls)

12:04.470 --> 12:07.007
- I told you, you'd never guess.

12:07.970 --> 12:10.768
(chirping from bird)

12:10.810 --> 12:12.346
- Uh, um, uh, uh, wait, uh, um.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.398
Your name, it's
forming in my mind.

12:17.650 --> 12:18.969
Um, uh, just a second.

12:19.030 --> 12:20.520
It's coming, it's coming.

12:21.780 --> 12:22.519
- Too late.

12:22.570 --> 12:23.696
(bird chirps)

12:23.740 --> 12:27.028
Now, I will have
your friend's head.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.992
- Just a minute! Juliet!

12:32.000 --> 12:35.743
(dramatic instrumental music)

12:46.970 --> 12:47.846
(grunts)

12:50.140 --> 12:53.974
(loud orchestral horns playing)

13:06.530 --> 13:09.863
(music grows softer)

13:21.550 --> 13:23.871
(breathing heavily and grunting)

13:28.300 --> 13:30.097
(cries out painfully)

13:38.060 --> 13:38.970
- Hi.

13:39.020 --> 13:40.931
- Because you helped us,

13:40.980 --> 13:42.857
we will help you again,

13:42.900 --> 13:45.892
but this really has
to be the last time.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.316
You're such a lot of trouble.

13:48.370 --> 13:49.519
- Okay.

13:51.950 --> 13:53.611
Please go and find
my father and Wolf,

13:53.660 --> 13:54.820
and tell them where I am.

13:54.870 --> 13:57.031
Tell them to come get me.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.115
- Bye.

14:00.880 --> 14:01.995
- Uh, who'd have thought it?

14:02.050 --> 14:03.256
Juliet the Axman.

14:03.300 --> 14:04.699
- Yeah, well, you know what?

14:04.760 --> 14:05.829
Is it any wonder he
turned into a sick sadist.

14:05.880 --> 14:06.835
- I know.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.757
- Psst! You down there.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.677
- It's another one
of those birds.

14:10.720 --> 14:12.005
- [Bird] I know
where Virginia is.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.425
- Oh! Okay!
- [Tony] Where?

14:13.470 --> 14:15.552
- She's in a tree
that is not a tree,

14:15.600 --> 14:17.807
in a place that is not a place.

14:17.850 --> 14:19.056
- Ah, ah, ho-ho-hold,

14:19.100 --> 14:20.806
can we just stop with
the rhyming crap?

14:20.860 --> 14:22.600
Take us there!

14:22.650 --> 14:23.275
- Oh, oh, oh!

14:23.320 --> 14:25.026
- Come on! Move!

14:39.460 --> 14:41.872
- [Bird] She's inside this tree.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.080
Bye.

14:45.010 --> 14:46.409
- [Tony] Wait a
minute, inside a tree?

14:46.460 --> 14:48.837
How can she be inside a tree?

14:48.880 --> 14:50.962
- [Wolf] Virginia!

14:51.010 --> 14:52.546
Virginia, are you up there?

14:52.600 --> 14:53.555
- Wolf!

14:55.140 --> 14:56.050
Wolf!

14:57.140 --> 14:58.846
- Oh, it's her, it's her.

14:58.890 --> 15:00.596
- Urn, how do we get in?

15:00.650 --> 15:02.265
- There's a door.

15:02.310 --> 15:04.437
- Uh, all right, a door?

15:07.900 --> 15:10.812
Where? I don't see a door.

15:10.860 --> 15:11.940
I don't see a door.

15:11.990 --> 15:12.809
There's no door.

15:12.870 --> 15:13.859
There's definitely no door.

15:13.910 --> 15:15.400
- Oh, if he's
concealed it with magic

15:15.450 --> 15:16.826
it could take weeks to open.

15:16.870 --> 15:18.656
- Just, um, why can't
you just come down

15:18.710 --> 15:20.109
and let us in from the inside?

15:20.170 --> 15:22.377
- Well, he's chained me up.

15:22.420 --> 15:23.830
I can't.

15:23.880 --> 15:25.745
Can't you climb up the tree?

15:25.800 --> 15:27.336
- Well there's no foot holds.

15:27.380 --> 15:29.507
- Well get a ladder
or something.

15:29.550 --> 15:31.541
- Where am I gonna get a ladder?

15:31.590 --> 15:32.750
Hold one second,

15:32.800 --> 15:33.596
if this is a magic
ax maybe I can--

15:33.640 --> 15:34.345
- Oh!

15:34.390 --> 15:35.550
- chop the tree down.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.170
- Virginia, can I
ask you a question?

15:37.220 --> 15:38.096
- [Virginia] What?

15:38.140 --> 15:39.516
- How long is your hair now?

15:39.560 --> 15:41.892
- Uh, it's, uh,
longer than ever.

15:41.940 --> 15:44.852
It's, uh, no.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.140
No.

15:46.190 --> 15:47.396
- That's a great idea.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.237
- No!

15:52.030 --> 15:54.021
- I've always
wanted to say this.

15:54.070 --> 15:55.571
Love of my life,

15:55.620 --> 15:58.908
let down your lustrous locks!

16:05.340 --> 16:07.080
-Owwwww!

16:09.260 --> 16:12.468
(struggles and grunts)

16:12.510 --> 16:14.330
Owwww!

16:16.600 --> 16:18.056
- Look out below!

16:18.100 --> 16:18.885
Close your eyes.

16:18.930 --> 16:19.919
- Wh-wh-what is it?

16:19.980 --> 16:21.470
- Dandruff!

16:21.520 --> 16:23.590
- I do not have, oww!

16:23.650 --> 16:26.357
- Oh, some people
can't take a joke.

16:28.110 --> 16:30.601
(struggles and grunts)

16:33.610 --> 16:34.986
Oh, what a moment in my life.

16:35.030 --> 16:37.442
My second opportunity
to save you.

16:37.490 --> 16:39.538
My story will be
immortalized in song,

16:39.580 --> 16:41.320
there's no question of that.

16:43.710 --> 16:46.122
Ah, I found another gray one!

16:46.170 --> 16:47.455
- Ugh.

16:53.930 --> 16:55.886
(grunts loudly)

16:58.510 --> 16:59.966
- Tada!

17:03.060 --> 17:06.439
(sinister instrumental music)

17:14.990 --> 17:15.979
- [Virginia] Ow!

17:16.030 --> 17:17.440
- Be careful you don't
trip over your hair.

17:17.490 --> 17:18.525
- No kidding.

17:24.910 --> 17:26.821
- Stay back,
Virginia. Stay back!

17:26.880 --> 17:28.120
- Virginia!

17:33.050 --> 17:34.620
Virginia!

17:36.380 --> 17:39.599
(struggles and grunts)

17:43.220 --> 17:45.188
(grunts loudly in pain)

17:51.980 --> 17:53.356
- [Wolf] Get the ax!

17:57.070 --> 17:58.810
- Dad, give me the ax!

17:58.870 --> 18:00.440
- [Wolf] Chop his head off!

18:00.490 --> 18:02.367
Stick it in his back! Anything!

18:03.580 --> 18:05.241
Do it!

18:05.290 --> 18:06.359
- Okay!

18:09.330 --> 18:10.627
- Agh!

18:12.920 --> 18:13.955
- Sorry!

18:14.010 --> 18:15.750
- Agh!

18:21.180 --> 18:23.341
- [Tony] Could somebody
move this door?

18:23.390 --> 18:25.631
My arm is squashed!
- [Virginia] Oh, Dad!

18:30.560 --> 18:31.606
- Virginia, are you all right?

18:31.650 --> 18:32.355
- Yes.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.435
- What is this place?

18:33.480 --> 18:34.970
- It's a bad place, let's go.

18:35.030 --> 18:36.486
- [Tony] That's a good idea.

18:36.530 --> 18:38.942
- Well, wait, we can't
just leave him like this.

18:38.990 --> 18:40.810
- You're right.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.269
Give me the ax. I'll do it.

18:42.330 --> 18:43.536
- Wait! We can't kill him!

18:43.580 --> 18:44.899
- Of course we
can! He'd kill us!

18:44.950 --> 18:46.861
-_ That's not the
mint. He's helpless.

18:46.910 --> 18:48.992
- Exactly why we
should kill him now!

18:49.040 --> 18:50.496
- Wolf, No!

18:50.540 --> 18:51.871
- Agh, he's gonna come after us!

18:51.920 --> 18:53.831
- I don't care. We're
not killing him.

18:55.170 --> 18:58.503
- Ugh, you're gonna
regret this moment.

18:59.760 --> 19:00.966
Come on.

19:04.850 --> 19:06.715
- [Tony] Ah, ha-ha-ha!

19:06.770 --> 19:08.590
Hey, boy, welcome back.

19:08.640 --> 19:10.596
Time for walkie.

19:12.060 --> 19:13.937
Oh, hey. How did the haircut go?

19:13.980 --> 19:15.971
- Well, uh,

19:16.030 --> 19:18.692
I think I might have overdone
the ax trim a little.

19:18.740 --> 19:19.855
- What? I don't,

19:21.030 --> 19:21.860
What th--

19:21.910 --> 19:23.866
- You just don't say a word!

19:25.990 --> 19:27.446
- Oh my.

19:30.540 --> 19:31.700
- What did?

19:34.540 --> 19:38.795
(screaming and yelling)

19:43.680 --> 19:45.341
- What do you want?

19:45.390 --> 19:47.597
- You are inviting trouble.

19:47.640 --> 19:49.551
- I'll tell you something,

19:49.600 --> 19:53.013
war is great fun when
there's no enemy.

19:53.060 --> 19:55.312
- You're very stupid,

19:55.360 --> 19:57.351
even for a troll.

19:57.400 --> 20:00.107
Wendell's kingdom
borders all the others,

20:00.150 --> 20:02.983
they will not let it
fall without a fight.

20:03.030 --> 20:05.612
The other kingdoms
will send in troops,

20:05.660 --> 20:07.946
and crush you!

20:07.990 --> 20:09.992
- Then I'll kill them all.

20:10.040 --> 20:12.747
I'm not scared of anybody.

20:12.790 --> 20:14.451
- Listen to me,

20:14.500 --> 20:17.242
I will give you
everything you desire,

20:17.300 --> 20:21.919
but you must leave Beantown now!

20:21.970 --> 20:23.961
- Beantown's old news.

20:24.010 --> 20:28.458
We've got control of every
village 20 miles from here,

20:28.510 --> 20:31.172
and it's not stopping there.

20:31.230 --> 20:35.803
I'm taking my half of
the kingdom right now.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.816
Wanna make something of it?

20:37.860 --> 20:39.816
(laughs)

20:49.990 --> 20:51.742
- [Tony] I don't believe it.

20:51.790 --> 20:53.246
- That's Acorn's wagon.

20:53.290 --> 20:55.531
That's it! That's him!

20:58.960 --> 21:00.757
- [Tony] We're going home.

21:00.800 --> 21:02.370
Bring Prince!

21:05.180 --> 21:07.216
- [Virginia] Okay, you talk.

21:08.550 --> 21:09.926
- [Tony] Ah, Hi, Acorn.

21:09.970 --> 21:10.880
- [Virginia] Hi.

21:10.930 --> 21:11.806
- Remember me?

21:11.850 --> 21:15.138
- Anthony! You
got out of prison.

21:15.190 --> 21:17.806
How, uh, unlikely.

21:17.860 --> 21:20.272
- Where's our mirror?

21:20.320 --> 21:21.469
- Mirror?

21:21.530 --> 21:23.100
- [Virginia] It belongs to us.

21:23.150 --> 21:24.856
- Was it valuable then?

21:24.900 --> 21:25.696
- Uh.

21:25.740 --> 21:28.197
- No, it's worthless.

21:28.240 --> 21:30.231
- You've come an awful long way

21:30.290 --> 21:32.531
to get back a worthless mirror.

21:32.580 --> 21:34.116
- It's a magic mirror.

21:34.160 --> 21:35.616
We traveled here through it,

21:35.670 --> 21:37.240
and we've been trapped
in this world ever since.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.240
- Look, all we want
to do is go home.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.165
We won't take the mirror, okay?

21:42.210 --> 21:44.212
We'll just use it to go home,

21:44.260 --> 21:47.468
and then you can do
whatever you want with it.

21:47.510 --> 21:49.717
- I'm moved by what you say.

21:49.760 --> 21:52.923
- Then please, let us go home.

21:52.970 --> 21:55.723
- But I don't have it anymore.

21:55.770 --> 21:57.840
I'm afraid I swapped it
with someone in the village.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.640
Not half an hour ago.

21:59.690 --> 22:00.816
- Swapped it?

22:00.860 --> 22:02.475
Swapped it for what?

22:07.780 --> 22:09.566
(sheep baas softly)

22:19.330 --> 22:20.911
- [Voiceover] Wolf.

22:22.960 --> 22:24.120
Wolf.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.806
Wolf.

22:35.310 --> 22:36.846
Wolf.

22:36.890 --> 22:40.053
Do you think you can
simply ignore me?

22:41.900 --> 22:43.185
- I've changed.

22:44.940 --> 22:46.896
I am no longer under
your influence.

22:46.940 --> 22:48.350
You cannot touch me.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.948
- Oh, really?

22:50.990 --> 22:54.539
It's a full moon tonight.

22:54.580 --> 22:57.652
Your blood is already hot.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.951
You are a wolf.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.164
What will you do when
the wild moon calls you?

23:05.420 --> 23:07.297
What will you do then

23:07.340 --> 23:09.251
to your new friends?

23:09.300 --> 23:11.427
(grunts as glass breaks loudly)

23:14.970 --> 23:16.767
- I don't think we should
go into this village.

23:16.810 --> 23:18.721
- This is where Acorn
said the mirror was.

23:18.770 --> 23:21.398
- A wolf goes by his
instincts and I don't like it.

23:21.440 --> 23:22.805
I mean, this is farming land,

23:22.860 --> 23:25.101
and farmers don't like wolfies.

23:26.480 --> 23:29.608
Huff! Puff! No, siree!

23:30.860 --> 23:31.815
Why don't we stop for breakfast,

23:31.860 --> 23:33.191
and think about what to do?

23:33.240 --> 23:34.400
- You already had breakfast.

23:34.450 --> 23:36.327
- Well, then I want
another breakfast!

23:36.370 --> 23:37.530
I mean, what are you my mother?

23:37.580 --> 23:39.116
You tell me when
I can eat or not?

23:39.160 --> 23:40.661
Why don't you just draw
up a list of things

23:40.710 --> 23:42.120
I can and can't do!

23:43.920 --> 23:45.035
- We're going into the village.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.626
End of discussion.

23:46.670 --> 23:48.547
You can do what you like.

23:51.970 --> 23:53.926
(growling noise)

23:55.140 --> 23:58.849
(light, happy whistle playing)

24:01.940 --> 24:04.101
Virginia, please forgive me.

24:04.150 --> 24:05.856
I didn't mean to be so rude.

24:05.900 --> 24:07.891
It's just that my
cycle is coming on.

24:07.940 --> 24:09.988
You see, once a month, I get
very irrational and angry

24:10.030 --> 24:12.021
and I just wanna pick a fight
with anyone who comes near me.

24:12.070 --> 24:13.276
- That sounds familiar.

24:13.320 --> 24:15.777
- But I'll be perfectly,
perfectly all right,

24:15.830 --> 24:18.731
if you just keep me
away from temptation.

24:18.790 --> 24:22.112
- You know, I get like that
too sometimes actually, but.

24:22.170 --> 24:23.660
- Oh!

24:27.300 --> 24:30.918
Look at those sheep. Trollops.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.619
Sheep out.

24:34.890 --> 24:35.959
Oh!

24:36.010 --> 24:39.764
(slow, wistful
instrumental music)

24:47.570 --> 24:49.185
Mornin'.

24:49.230 --> 24:51.107
- Mornin'.

24:51.150 --> 24:52.981
My name's Sally Peep.

24:53.030 --> 24:54.850
I'm a shepherdess.

24:54.910 --> 24:57.822
- Oh, there's no
question about that.

24:57.870 --> 25:01.943
- My, what very strong
arms you've got.

25:03.620 --> 25:05.952
If my door wasn't locked,

25:06.000 --> 25:08.958
I'd be scared you'd
come into my house,

25:09.000 --> 25:11.457
and huff and puff,

25:11.510 --> 25:14.627
and blow all my clothes off.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.386
(laughs)

25:16.430 --> 25:17.795
Mmm.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.135
- Where do you live, Sally?

25:19.180 --> 25:20.886
- Okay, let's go.

25:26.100 --> 25:28.398
(laughs)

25:31.820 --> 25:35.233
(whimsical instrumental music)

25:37.660 --> 25:40.902
(background chatter)

25:48.000 --> 25:49.536
- [Voiceover]
Welcome one and all,

25:49.590 --> 25:50.909
to the second day of the

25:50.960 --> 25:53.963
Little Lamb Village
Annual Competition.

25:54.010 --> 25:56.046
Well, it's a new day today,

25:56.090 --> 25:57.921
and a new competition.

26:00.470 --> 26:03.803
Mrs. Morris, these
radishes are beautiful.

26:03.850 --> 26:06.227
I'll give 'em nine out of ten.

26:07.310 --> 26:09.437
But the Peeps' radishes.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.357
Well, they've done it again.

26:11.400 --> 26:12.890
They're out of this world.

26:12.940 --> 26:15.488
I've got to give
them ten out of ten.

26:15.530 --> 26:17.737
(clapping and
murmurs of approval)

26:17.780 --> 26:19.657
Come, Pete the grocer.

26:19.700 --> 26:23.079
Come up and get your
9th award today.

26:24.540 --> 26:26.201
Yes, yes, well.

26:28.290 --> 26:30.918
- The Peeps have done it again.

26:30.960 --> 26:32.791
They're just best at everything.

26:32.840 --> 26:34.080
- Ladies and Gentlemen,

26:34.130 --> 26:35.666
in an hour's time,

26:35.720 --> 26:39.042
I'll announce the winner of
Best Cheese in the village.

26:39.090 --> 26:41.388
(clapping)

26:47.940 --> 26:48.929
- Excuse me,

26:48.980 --> 26:50.686
could you tell me who's
in charge around here?

26:50.730 --> 26:52.015
- I am the village idiot,

26:52.060 --> 26:54.779
and I am in charge
of the wishing well.

26:54.820 --> 26:56.276
- Do we have magnets
in our pockets?

26:56.320 --> 26:57.526
How do we attract
people like this?

26:57.570 --> 26:58.446
- I don't know.

26:58.490 --> 27:00.947
- It's a nice dog you got there.

27:00.990 --> 27:03.402
He reminds me Of someone.

27:06.250 --> 27:09.117
(clapping and cheering)

27:09.170 --> 27:10.455
' [Tony] What's that for?

27:10.500 --> 27:12.161
- [Village Idiot] That's
the village's present

27:12.210 --> 27:13.495
for Prince Wendell.

27:13.540 --> 27:16.418
It's to be his coronation cloak.

27:16.460 --> 27:18.007
- I hope he likes it.

27:18.050 --> 27:19.586
- Aren't you gonna
make a wish then?

27:19.630 --> 27:21.791
It's very bad luck to pass

27:21.840 --> 27:24.468
without makin' a wish.

27:24.510 --> 27:26.057
- That's money we
shouldn't be wasting.

27:26.100 --> 27:27.761
- Oh, you are so prim,

27:27.810 --> 27:30.267
but my wish will
change all of that.

27:33.150 --> 27:37.223
(background chatter
and animal noises)

27:41.780 --> 27:45.193
(coins whizzing down
a very long distance)

27:45.240 --> 27:47.947
(clanks and clatters
at the bottom)

27:48.000 --> 27:49.240
- It don't work.

27:49.290 --> 27:50.530
- Oh, uh.

27:50.580 --> 27:53.071
- It used _to _be a real
magic Wishing well,

27:53.130 --> 27:55.121
and folks they
traveled from all over

27:55.170 --> 27:57.877
the kingdoms to have
things blessed in it.

27:57.920 --> 27:59.968
It's all dried up now.

28:00.010 --> 28:02.672
It hasn't flowed for years.

28:02.720 --> 28:05.507
I have made it my life's work.

28:05.550 --> 28:07.848
- As fascinating
as your story is,

28:07.890 --> 28:09.801
what we're actually
looking for is a mirror

28:09.850 --> 28:11.340
about so big. Black.

28:11.390 --> 28:12.800
We were told that someone

28:12.850 --> 28:15.307
bought it off of
Acorn the Dwarf.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.430
- Mm-hmm.

28:17.480 --> 28:19.061
I have made it my life's work

28:19.110 --> 28:22.273
to wait by this well
until it fills up again.

28:22.320 --> 28:25.062
What do you think of that, eh?

28:25.120 --> 28:27.361
- It's no use. The_man
is a complete idiot.

28:28.910 --> 28:30.116
- If only.

28:31.080 --> 28:34.664
Now my father, he
was a complete idiot.

28:35.960 --> 28:37.791
I'm still a half-wit.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.085
- Everywhere is
full, what with the

28:45.090 --> 28:47.718
but you can stay
here if you like.

28:49.770 --> 28:52.933
Might not be posh, like
what you're used to.

28:52.980 --> 28:54.140
- It stinks.

28:54.190 --> 28:56.431
- (laughs) It's
great. Thank you.

28:56.480 --> 28:57.765
By the way, do you
know of anybody

28:57.820 --> 29:01.438
that's bought a mirror from
a traveling trader recently?

29:01.490 --> 29:04.732
- No, ah, you'll wanna
talk to the local judge.

29:04.780 --> 29:07.943
He bought a load of
things off that dwarf.

29:07.990 --> 29:09.946
Prizes for the competition.

29:09.990 --> 29:12.458
You'll find him in
the inn over the road.

29:12.500 --> 29:15.537
They do lovely food there, too.

29:15.580 --> 29:18.287
Well, that's the
understatement of the year.

29:19.420 --> 29:20.580
- Thanks.

29:20.630 --> 29:22.086
- om Aghhh. Oh!

29:23.630 --> 29:25.120
- What's wrong?

29:25.180 --> 29:27.171
Dah! Cramps.

29:27.220 --> 29:31.509
Oh, oh, I need to go to bed.

29:31.560 --> 29:32.800
I need to lie down immediately.

29:32.850 --> 29:34.932
Oh! Oh!

29:37.520 --> 29:41.104
I need a hot rabbit to stroke,

29:41.150 --> 29:42.936
to comfort me.

29:42.990 --> 29:45.606
A long-eared rabbit is best.

29:47.450 --> 29:48.485
Now!

29:49.580 --> 29:52.322
Now. Right now.

29:59.380 --> 30:01.200
- You know, you're running
a terrible temperature.

30:01.250 --> 30:03.878
- Oh, they look so
innocent, don't they?

30:03.920 --> 30:05.797
But they're not!

30:05.840 --> 30:08.968
They're provocative,
teasing, little fluff balls.

30:09.010 --> 30:12.798
Ah, just look at her
beady little eyes.

30:12.850 --> 30:15.341
She knows exactly
what she's doing.

30:15.390 --> 30:17.267
Don't ya?

30:17.310 --> 30:18.686
- You just feel really hot.

30:18.730 --> 30:20.357
- Oh, stop fussin' over me!

30:20.400 --> 30:21.936
Your not my mother!

30:21.980 --> 30:23.857
Stop mothering and smothering

30:23.900 --> 30:25.686
and cubber-loving everybody,

30:25.740 --> 30:27.856
like a little dwarf housewife!

30:28.950 --> 30:30.520
Go out! Leave me alone!

30:30.570 --> 30:31.980
- Hey! What are you talkin'
to my daughter like that for?

30:32.030 --> 30:33.486
All right? I'm not
gonna take that kind--

30:33.540 --> 30:37.533
- [Voiceover] Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!

30:37.580 --> 30:39.821
(screams and cheering)

30:39.880 --> 30:42.166
(whimsical flute playing)

30:42.210 --> 30:43.996
- I'll huff and puff.

30:46.010 --> 30:49.832
(cheering and chatter
from the crowd)

30:52.930 --> 30:54.420
- Let's go see what that is.

30:57.850 --> 31:01.513
- You stay with me.
(soft growling noises)

31:02.690 --> 31:06.148
(cheers and light,
happy whistle playing)

31:15.910 --> 31:17.650
- Come on, come on, come on.

31:17.710 --> 31:19.530
That's the place for us.

31:27.970 --> 31:29.961
Oh, this potato.

31:30.010 --> 31:31.329
- Mm, did you try the squash?

31:31.390 --> 31:32.789
- It's absolutely incredible.

31:32.850 --> 31:34.044
- I know.

31:34.100 --> 31:37.729
- I can't, mm, Virginia look.

31:37.770 --> 31:39.761
Tomorrow's competition.

31:39.810 --> 31:41.391
- Oh my God, Dad look.

31:41.440 --> 31:43.510
The mirror is one of the prizes.

31:45.650 --> 31:48.027
Sheep and Shepherdess
Competition. Hmm.

31:49.030 --> 31:50.099
- We've gotta talk to the judge.

31:50.150 --> 31:51.060
- I know.

31:51.110 --> 31:52.350
- There we are, my dears.

31:52.410 --> 31:53.900
- Uh-huh. Is the--
- [Virginia] Oh, boy.

31:53.950 --> 31:55.520
- Judge about?

31:55.580 --> 31:58.151
- The judge'll be in first
in here 8 o'clock on the dot.

31:58.200 --> 32:00.612
There's some more lovely
vegetables for you.

32:00.660 --> 32:01.911
- Yeah, just keep it comin'.

32:01.960 --> 32:03.416
This is incredible.

32:03.460 --> 32:05.121
And this cider? I
don't even like cider.

32:05.170 --> 32:06.660
I've had five pints.

32:06.710 --> 32:09.713
- That cider comes from
young Colin Peep's apples.

32:09.760 --> 32:13.469
And the lamb was reared
by my brother, Larry Peep.

32:14.550 --> 32:16.848
Everything you're eatin'
comes from us Peeps.

32:16.890 --> 32:19.552
Best farming family in the
all of the Nine Kingdoms,

32:19.600 --> 32:20.885
if I say it meself.

32:20.940 --> 32:22.680
- Well, you go right
ahead and say it.

32:22.730 --> 32:24.015
What is your secret?

32:24.060 --> 32:27.723
- Oh, I suppose we're
just good farmers.

32:27.780 --> 32:29.600
- Hah. Mm.

32:32.030 --> 32:33.190
Oh.

32:33.240 --> 32:35.367
- Start without
me, why don't ya?

32:35.410 --> 32:36.479
Hi.

32:36.530 --> 32:37.519
Oh!

32:37.580 --> 32:38.820
- Shouldn't you be in bed?

32:38.870 --> 32:41.077
- Bed? Oh no, I feel
bounding with energy.

32:41.120 --> 32:42.701
I feel full of life!

32:45.170 --> 32:46.626
- Where's the rabbit?

32:48.000 --> 32:49.240
- What rabbit's that?

32:50.710 --> 32:52.416
- The one I gave you to cuddle.

32:53.550 --> 32:56.792
- Goodness me, I think
she must have hopped away.

32:59.970 --> 33:03.849
- (laughs) You've got an
appetite like a wolf, you have.

33:03.890 --> 33:05.687
(growls)

33:05.730 --> 33:06.856
Ooooh.

33:06.900 --> 33:09.812
Oh, by the way folks,
Judge has just walked in

33:09.860 --> 33:11.145
if you want to talk to him.

33:11.190 --> 33:12.316
- Oh, thank you.

33:12.360 --> 33:13.691
- Thank you.

33:13.740 --> 33:15.981
- Mm-mm-mm.

33:19.580 --> 33:23.118
- So, you can see,
Sir, that in a way,

33:23.160 --> 33:25.958
this mirror really
is actually ours.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.490
- Yeah.

33:27.540 --> 33:29.417
- No, it's not.

33:29.460 --> 33:32.372
I bought that fair and square.

33:36.930 --> 33:39.216
I buy a whole batch
of things every year

33:40.430 --> 33:42.842
for the village prizes.

33:42.890 --> 33:45.552
- Um, fine.

33:45.600 --> 33:46.840
You know, Your Honor,

33:46.900 --> 33:48.299
I know how these
things usually work,

33:48.360 --> 33:51.727
so how 'bout I slip
you a few gold coins?

33:52.990 --> 33:57.279
- I'm a judge and I don't like
people trying to bribe me.

33:57.320 --> 33:58.059
- [Tony] Oh--

33:58.120 --> 33:59.769
- No, not another word!

33:59.830 --> 34:02.537
Or I'll have you thrown
out of the village.

34:02.580 --> 34:04.707
Now is the month of May

34:04.750 --> 34:07.913
And when merry
lambs are playing

34:07.960 --> 34:10.372
For the lady, for the lady

34:10.420 --> 34:12.376
For the lady oh

34:12.420 --> 34:15.878
It's with his bonny lass

34:15.920 --> 34:17.046
- Oh!

34:17.090 --> 34:18.796
- You're new, aren't you?

34:18.840 --> 34:20.501
- Yeah.

34:20.550 --> 34:23.599
- I can't get these
sherpa tips undone.

34:23.640 --> 34:25.881
Could you help me, Mister?

34:25.930 --> 34:27.386
- Well, I, um.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.647
- Yeah, what is your name?

34:31.730 --> 34:32.606
- Wolfson.

34:34.150 --> 34:37.142
- Wolfson. (laughs)

34:39.280 --> 34:41.737
- Warren Wolfson.

34:41.780 --> 34:44.908
- It's my 18th birthday today.

34:44.950 --> 34:48.408
Bet you can't guess what's
gonna happen to me tonight.

34:48.460 --> 34:51.281
- Ah! Is it the bumps?

34:52.710 --> 34:56.373
- What's that stickin' out
the back of your trousers?

34:56.420 --> 34:58.627
Down there at the back.

34:58.680 --> 35:02.389
It's quite a bulge. (laughs)

35:03.720 --> 35:05.381
- I must get going.

35:05.430 --> 35:07.807
I think I left a
chop on my plate.

35:09.100 --> 35:11.148
- Arrrgh!

35:11.190 --> 35:14.853
No outsiders mess
With Peep girls.

35:14.900 --> 35:16.185
You understand?

35:16.240 --> 35:18.606
- What are you doin' around
here anyway, Mister Wolfson?

35:18.650 --> 35:19.810
- Well I--

35:19.860 --> 35:22.112
- Ahhhhh! Let's
take him out back,

35:22.160 --> 35:23.866
and give him a proper--

35:23.910 --> 35:26.788
- Excuse me! What are
you doing to my husband?

35:27.870 --> 35:28.780
- Your husband?

35:28.830 --> 35:30.286
- Yes, he's not
at all well today,

35:30.330 --> 35:32.207
and I must take
him home right now.

35:32.250 --> 35:33.786
Thanks. Good night.

35:33.840 --> 35:34.738
- Good night.

35:37.340 --> 35:38.876
Excuse me.

35:38.920 --> 35:41.673
Oh, Virginia, when you
said I was your husband,

35:41.720 --> 35:43.631
I went all hard and
soft at the same time.

35:43.680 --> 35:45.341
- I only said that to
get you out of here.

35:45.390 --> 35:46.880
Come on.

35:46.930 --> 35:47.885
- Oh, Virginia!

35:47.930 --> 35:50.763
I feel so alive!

35:50.810 --> 35:53.608
I can see everything for miles!

35:55.860 --> 35:59.318
Oh, look at the moon.

35:59.360 --> 36:01.066
Doesn't it just
make you wanna howl?

36:01.110 --> 36:04.819
It's soooooo beautiful.

36:04.870 --> 36:06.406
- Not really.

36:08.580 --> 36:10.650
- My mama was obsessed
with the moon.

36:12.540 --> 36:15.373
She used to drag us all
out just to watch it

36:15.420 --> 36:16.876
when we were cubs.

36:19.010 --> 36:22.332
Shepherdess makes quite a mess,

36:22.380 --> 36:25.884
but little lambs are lovely.

36:28.810 --> 36:31.882
The moon makes me
hungry for everything.

36:33.310 --> 36:34.891
- Time to go to sleep.

36:39.780 --> 36:40.678
- Good night, then.

36:40.740 --> 36:42.025
- Good night. What your step.

36:42.070 --> 36:44.447
(mumblings of good byes)

36:44.490 --> 36:46.230
- Not a bad place.

36:46.280 --> 36:49.659
Boy, that cider was
somethin'. Ten pints.

36:49.700 --> 36:53.079
Hey, wanna go for walkies?

36:55.540 --> 36:56.746
Look, yes, all right,

36:56.790 --> 36:59.759
I feel guilty about what
has happened to you.

36:59.800 --> 37:02.257
All right? But if I
got you into this mess,

37:02.300 --> 37:04.962
then I'll get you out. Okay?

37:07.890 --> 37:11.303
(dramatic slow
instrumental music)

37:13.850 --> 37:16.648
(quiet whispering)

37:30.870 --> 37:32.326
Wait here.

37:34.830 --> 37:37.242
- And where's the
birthday girl at?

37:39.460 --> 37:41.451
Why do you think
everything the Peeps make

37:41.510 --> 37:44.377
tastes so good,
Sally Shepherdess?

37:45.720 --> 37:48.792
- I don't right as know.

37:48.850 --> 37:51.091
Used to be that_there
was a magic well in town,

37:51.140 --> 37:52.710
but well's dried up.

37:52.770 --> 37:54.476
Everyone knows that.

37:54.520 --> 37:55.885
- Do they now?

37:57.230 --> 38:00.688
Well, since you're 18,

38:00.730 --> 38:04.359
I'm gonna let you in
on the family secret.

38:04.400 --> 38:06.231
Go on, boys.

38:13.080 --> 38:17.619
The reason_there's_no more
magic water in the Village well,

38:17.670 --> 38:19.877
is 'cause me and my brother

38:19.920 --> 38:24.129
diverted the stream
40 years ago.

38:24.170 --> 38:27.082
The Peeps have
all the magic now.

38:28.220 --> 38:30.962
(twinkling instrumental music)

38:33.720 --> 38:35.927
Let's have a look at your sheep.

38:38.730 --> 38:40.266
Ugly bugger, isn't he?

38:41.730 --> 38:43.220
Can't see him winnin' you

38:43.280 --> 38:45.851
the lovely shepherdess
competition.

38:45.900 --> 38:49.654
- [Voiceover] What do you
want in my magic waters.

38:49.700 --> 38:53.443
- Fill this sheep with
your goodness and life.

39:01.710 --> 39:02.779
- [Sally] Oh!

39:05.880 --> 39:07.757
(laughs)

39:10.510 --> 39:13.172
Wilf, it's amazin'!

39:14.470 --> 39:18.759
- Don't you never
breathe a word to anyone,

39:20.150 --> 39:22.721
or I'll cut your throat.

39:22.770 --> 39:25.022
Grandchild or no grandchild.

39:28.530 --> 39:31.363
- Do you have any idea
what you do to me?

39:31.410 --> 39:33.196
You will _never_ know
love like mine.

39:33.240 --> 39:35.322
I am your mate for life!

39:35.370 --> 39:37.747
- Wolf, you don't even
know what you're saying.

39:37.790 --> 39:38.654
I know you're a--

39:38.710 --> 39:40.701
- Oh, you know, do you?

39:40.750 --> 39:42.820
Ah, you know everything.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.086
You're little Miss Perfect,

39:44.130 --> 39:46.416
sticks up her hand and
can answer every question,

39:46.460 --> 39:47.757
but knows nothing.

39:47.800 --> 39:49.961
You're pretending
to live, Virginia.

39:50.010 --> 39:52.638
You're doing everything,
but actually living.

39:52.680 --> 39:54.636
You're driving me crazy!

39:54.680 --> 39:57.012
- Stop bullying me!
I don't like it.

39:57.060 --> 39:59.722
Now go to bed!

39:59.770 --> 40:00.930
Now.

40:00.980 --> 40:02.641
- Or what?

40:03.770 --> 40:05.681
Will you scream?

40:05.730 --> 40:08.233
That's what most people
do when they see a wolf.

40:08.280 --> 40:11.238
They scream, scream, and scream.

40:11.280 --> 40:14.113
What are you gonna
do? Stick it in me?

40:14.160 --> 40:16.367
That's what everybody does
when there's a wolf around.

40:16.410 --> 40:19.652
They stick it and they stab
it and they smoke it out.

40:19.700 --> 40:22.703
They burned my
parents good. Oh yes!

40:22.750 --> 40:24.786
The good people,
the nice farmers,

40:24.840 --> 40:29.334
made a great big fire and
burnt them both. (growls)

40:29.380 --> 40:31.928
- Hey! You're never
gonna guess what I found.

40:31.970 --> 40:34.712
I know why the Peeps
win everything.

40:38.560 --> 40:40.096
Well, he looks better.

40:41.230 --> 40:44.017
- Fine mess! Fine
mess! Fine mess!

40:44.060 --> 40:45.516
Now she hates ya.

40:45.560 --> 40:47.221
Oh, now she hates you.

40:47.270 --> 40:49.522
Oh, because you're an animal!

40:49.570 --> 40:52.482
Oh, you deserve
it, you're a nasty,

40:52.530 --> 40:54.191
nasty animal!

40:54.240 --> 40:57.778
Oh, nasty, nasty animal!

40:57.830 --> 40:58.899
Animal!

41:00.330 --> 41:02.992
- Who are your companions?

41:03.040 --> 41:05.998
- I'm not tellin' you
anything about her.

41:06.040 --> 41:07.120
- Her?

41:08.710 --> 41:11.042
- Oh, agh, agh.

41:11.090 --> 41:12.626
- What's she like?

41:14.800 --> 41:18.384
Is she tasty?

41:19.760 --> 41:20.670
- You're evil.

41:20.720 --> 41:22.176
You stay away from me!

41:22.230 --> 41:24.801
- Look at the moon.

41:24.850 --> 41:29.139
Then tell me what you'd
really like to do to her.

41:29.190 --> 41:32.648
And let the wolf out.

41:32.690 --> 41:35.659
(groans of anger and despair)

41:35.700 --> 41:38.942
(tinkling of glass breaking)

41:41.830 --> 41:44.742
(agitated horses neigh)

41:53.920 --> 41:55.717
- Hey, what do you think?

41:55.760 --> 41:56.795
- Oh!

41:56.840 --> 41:58.592
- Hey, don't scare it.

41:58.640 --> 42:00.801
It took me almost three
hours to catch it.

42:00.850 --> 42:02.841
- Why have you stolen a sheep?

42:02.890 --> 42:03.925
- For the competition,

42:03.980 --> 42:06.380
the Beautiful Sheep and
Shepherdess Competition.

42:06.440 --> 42:08.806
- (laughs) No, no, no.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.430
- Yes, yes, yes, how
else are we gonna get

42:10.480 --> 42:12.357
our hands on that mirror?

42:12.400 --> 42:14.857
- I am not a shepherdess.
I'm a waitress.

42:14.900 --> 42:16.811
I don't know
anything about sheep.

42:16.860 --> 42:17.736
- You don't have to.

42:17.780 --> 42:19.941
That's the beauty of my plan.

42:19.990 --> 42:21.400
- Well this sheep sucks.

42:21.450 --> 42:22.576
This isn't gonna win anything.

42:22.620 --> 42:23.826
It looks like it's about to die.

42:23.870 --> 42:25.406
- Well, it won't,
once it's had a trip

42:25.460 --> 42:26.666
down the magic wishing well.

42:26.710 --> 42:28.246
All right, you get busy
making your costume.

42:28.290 --> 42:30.246
I'm gonna go get it dipped.

42:31.460 --> 42:33.337
- My costume?

42:33.380 --> 42:34.665
- Yeah, yeah, look.

42:36.720 --> 42:39.541
Who would've ever thought
these used to be curtains?

42:39.590 --> 42:42.093
Now, come on, hurry
up, and watch Prince.

43:00.320 --> 43:01.480
- Hello?

43:02.830 --> 43:04.730
- How are you feeling?

43:04.790 --> 43:07.247
- Oh, not too good.

43:07.290 --> 43:10.669
Everything's hazy at the moment.

43:14.670 --> 43:16.718
I must fight what I am.

43:18.300 --> 43:19.927
I can't even remember
what I've done.

43:19.970 --> 43:21.039
You better tie me up,

43:21.090 --> 43:22.671
that way I can't escape.

43:22.720 --> 43:23.800
- What do you mean tie you up?

43:23.850 --> 43:25.056
- Tie me up! Stop me escaping!

43:25.100 --> 43:26.886
Which part don't you understand?

43:26.930 --> 43:27.919
- All right.

43:36.940 --> 43:38.350
- Tighter.

43:40.360 --> 43:42.692
Tighter! Tighter.

43:42.740 --> 43:45.652
IfI struggle I can get free.

43:45.700 --> 43:47.076
Tighter.

43:50.750 --> 43:52.991
What's the worst thing
you've ever done?

43:55.250 --> 43:56.751
Tighter.

43:59.340 --> 44:01.331
Or I'll eat you up.

44:03.800 --> 44:08.669
- Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!

44:08.730 --> 44:12.302
Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!

44:12.350 --> 44:15.433
Wolf! Wolf!

44:15.480 --> 44:16.640
- Oh no!

44:17.690 --> 44:20.773
The chickens! They've
been torn apart.

44:28.750 --> 44:31.366
(breathes heavily)

44:37.840 --> 44:40.047
- Kill the girl.

44:40.090 --> 44:44.834
- Noooooo! Nooooo!

44:46.760 --> 44:49.137
- Get me the dog.

44:51.770 --> 44:53.010
Do it!

45:00.150 --> 45:03.313
(growls and struggles)

45:05.530 --> 45:09.648
(dramatic instrumental music)

45:11.710 --> 45:15.248
(deep growling)

45:21.720 --> 45:25.759
- Due to the appalling
chicken massacre this morning,

45:27.430 --> 45:28.499
we're bringing fonNard

45:28.560 --> 45:31.211

45:33.770 --> 45:36.261

45:40.820 --> 45:44.233
(happy, upbeat whistle playing)

45:50.830 --> 45:53.788
(crowd Oohs and Ahs)

45:57.540 --> 45:58.871
- What do ya think your doin'?

45:58.920 --> 46:00.296
- You're not local.

46:00.340 --> 46:02.046
- You little goblin.

46:02.090 --> 46:04.411
Don't you dare.

46:20.730 --> 46:22.971
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

46:26.150 --> 46:28.698
All right, all
right, I've got it.

46:28.740 --> 46:31.618
We're gonna do this right.

46:31.660 --> 46:32.820
Hold on.

46:32.870 --> 46:36.249
(dramatic music with
twinkling sounds)

46:38.000 --> 46:41.083
- [Voiceover] What do you
wash in my magic waters?

46:41.130 --> 46:43.951
- Um, I want the same as
you did for the Peeps.

46:44.010 --> 46:46.251
I want a beautiful sheep.

46:52.600 --> 46:55.592
Now, it's time for the
well of fortune. (laughs)

46:59.230 --> 47:03.644
- Now, we've got
three contestants.

47:03.690 --> 47:05.601
Good gracious me.

47:05.650 --> 47:08.141
Well, the more the
merrier, I say.

47:08.200 --> 47:11.317
Ah, where's your sheep, Miss?

47:12.700 --> 47:14.691
- Oh, he's on his way.

47:14.740 --> 47:17.994
- She hasn't got one. (laughs)

47:18.040 --> 47:19.200
- I do too.

47:20.960 --> 47:22.245
He's just in the barn.

47:22.290 --> 47:24.201
- Well go and fetch him, girl,

47:24.250 --> 47:25.456
and smartish too,

47:25.510 --> 47:27.967
else I shall have

47:29.630 --> 47:32.133
Now to start the competition,

47:32.180 --> 47:33.636
I'm going to ask all entrants,

47:33.680 --> 47:35.807
as is the age-old custom,

47:35.850 --> 47:38.887
to sing their
favorite sheep song.

47:38.940 --> 47:41.932
Young Mary Ramley,

Just put sheep words to it.

48:16.310 --> 48:17.550
- I can't do this.

48:17.600 --> 48:18.760
There is no way I'm
gonna win this thing.

48:18.810 --> 48:19.720
- Virginia, listen

48:33.240 --> 48:36.949

Leave 'em alone

48:40.830 --> 48:44.539
Wagging their

50:04.580 --> 50:07.572
Singin' we will, we will

50:07.630 --> 50:10.747
Shear you

50:10.800 --> 50:13.792
Singin' we will, we will

50:13.840 --> 50:15.580
Shear you

50:15.630 --> 50:17.257
- I will keep it under control.

50:17.300 --> 50:20.349
Oh, oh, time to kill.

50:20.390 --> 50:23.211
Time to kill, oh,
that's what I've got.

50:23.270 --> 50:25.761
Oh, nice day, nothin' to do.

50:25.810 --> 50:29.723
Oh, ah. No! No!

50:29.770 --> 50:34.059
I am serene. I am
calm and serene.

50:34.110 --> 50:37.409
I am very, very serene. Oh!

50:39.240 --> 50:43.574
I am very, very serenely hungry.

50:43.620 --> 50:48.364
- Three beautiful girls,
and three beautiful lambs.

50:48.420 --> 50:51.378
This is the _hardest
competition to judge so far,

50:51.420 --> 50:53.490
by a long shot.

50:53.550 --> 50:55.666
I give Mary eight out of ten,

50:55.720 --> 50:58.006
and a well-earned third place.

50:58.050 --> 51:00.757
(clapping)

51:00.800 --> 51:03.598
Oh, these lambs
are so beautiful.

51:03.640 --> 51:05.926
How do I make a decision?

51:07.480 --> 51:10.768
I've got to give Sally
Peep ten out of ten.

51:10.810 --> 51:14.064
(loud cheering and screams)

51:14.110 --> 51:15.429
Butthen,

51:15.490 --> 51:17.856
_ I also have to _
give Virginia LeWIs

51:17.900 --> 51:20.562
ten out of ten as well.

51:20.620 --> 51:23.020
- A tie? We can't have a tie!

51:23.080 --> 51:24.695
Someone has to win.

51:24.740 --> 51:27.789
- I have to win_.
Peeps always Win.

51:27.830 --> 51:29.741
- How about you get a
trophy and I get the mirror?

51:29.790 --> 51:31.872
- They're both mine.

51:31.920 --> 51:34.832
She shouldn't even be
allowed to take part.

51:34.880 --> 51:36.416
It's not fair!

51:36.460 --> 51:40.089
- Why are you givin' an
outsider ten out of ten?

51:40.130 --> 51:42.132
- She's a dirty cheat.

51:42.180 --> 51:44.501
Give the prize to my girl.

51:44.560 --> 51:47.267
- Back off, back off, I said!

51:48.770 --> 51:49.589
Now look,

51:50.770 --> 51:54.649
this is a shepherdess
competition.

51:55.780 --> 51:58.601
We'll set up an obstacle course,

51:58.650 --> 52:00.777
and whoever guides
her sheep into the pen

52:00.820 --> 52:03.869
in the shortest
time, is the winner.

52:03.910 --> 52:06.868
Using only sheep
dogs and commands.

52:07.910 --> 52:09.616
Sound fair enough?

52:09.660 --> 52:11.070
- Yeah, all right.

52:11.120 --> 52:13.372
- No, I don't have a sheep dog.

52:13.420 --> 52:15.376
- 'Spect I'll win then, won't I?

52:15.420 --> 52:17.627
(laughing)

52:19.970 --> 52:23.087
- Damn, damn, where am I
gonna find a sheep dog?

52:23.140 --> 52:24.676
- Excuse me.

52:24.720 --> 52:27.462
- Just be, please, all right,
I'm trying to think here.

52:27.520 --> 52:28.885
- You've got a dog.

52:28.930 --> 52:30.886
- I don't have a, oh, that dog?

52:30.940 --> 52:34.307
You know what? I don't know if
you've noticed, but that dog,

52:37.570 --> 52:38.776
thatsit

52:38.820 --> 52:41.482
You're an absolute genius.

52:41.530 --> 52:43.737
Virginia, stall, stall!

52:46.410 --> 52:50.153
(tinkling, magical
instrumental music)

52:54.460 --> 52:56.371
Magic wishing well,

52:56.420 --> 52:59.457
please use your
magic, whatever, water

52:59.510 --> 53:02.081
to bring back to
life this poor dog

53:02.130 --> 53:04.337
trapped in a gold body.

53:04.390 --> 53:06.597
- [Voiceover] Oh
no, not you again.

53:06.640 --> 53:09.677
- Each girl stances
into the village

53:09.720 --> 53:13.838
and can only use her
shepherding skills with her dog.

53:13.900 --> 53:15.800
Are you ready, Sally?

53:15.860 --> 53:19.478
Starting now!

53:20.780 --> 53:22.736
(loudly whistles)

53:24.490 --> 53:27.152
(cheers from crowd)

53:29.120 --> 53:32.999
(exciting instrumental music)

53:35.080 --> 53:36.707
Coming up to thirty!

53:36.750 --> 53:37.990
- Okay, let it have worked,

53:38.040 --> 53:40.588
God, please, let one
thing have gone right.

53:42.800 --> 53:45.712
Oh no. It didn't work. What?

53:46.640 --> 53:49.052
(loud cheers)

53:51.600 --> 53:55.092
(dog barks as crowd
hollers and cheers)

53:56.310 --> 53:57.356
- Pen's closed.

53:58.690 --> 54:02.524
- Done in a splendid
count of 85.

54:02.570 --> 54:05.277
(loud cheers)

54:05.320 --> 54:06.400
- Prince, come on.

54:06.450 --> 54:07.735
Come on, boy, come on, come on.

54:07.780 --> 54:09.156
Oh-oh-oh look, look!

54:09.200 --> 54:11.031
Prince, Prince fetch.

54:16.370 --> 54:17.746
Oh, yes, yes.

54:18.880 --> 54:23.579
(loud twinkling
instrumental sounds)

54:23.630 --> 54:27.293
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

54:27.340 --> 54:29.501
Welcome back, Princey boy!

54:29.550 --> 54:31.131
- [Prince] Grrrrr!

54:31.180 --> 54:32.169
- Ow!

54:35.690 --> 54:37.681
- Why did you turn me into gold?

54:37.730 --> 54:39.971
- I didn't mean, it was a heat
of the moment kind of thing.

54:40.020 --> 54:42.602
I was trying to protect
you from those trolls.

54:42.650 --> 54:45.562
- Ah, you really are the
most incompetent manservant,

54:45.610 --> 54:46.599
I've ever had.

54:46.650 --> 54:49.369
You are a complete
imbecile. What are you?

54:49.410 --> 54:52.538
- Prince, all right, I really
need your help here, okay?

54:52.580 --> 54:55.242
- Time starts now!

54:55.290 --> 54:58.077
- Come on, lamb! Come on, lamby!

54:58.120 --> 55:00.281
Come on! Come on!

55:00.330 --> 55:01.206
Come on!

55:02.500 --> 55:04.957
(whistles) Come here, lamb!

55:05.010 --> 55:06.796
Come on, lamby!

55:06.840 --> 55:09.718
Come on, lamb! Come on, lamb!

55:09.760 --> 55:11.296
Come here, lamby!

55:11.350 --> 55:13.557
Come on! Come on!

55:13.600 --> 55:15.090
- Going up to 30.

55:15.140 --> 55:17.347
- Come here, lamb,
come on, come on!

55:17.390 --> 55:19.517
Come on, lamby, come on!

55:19.560 --> 55:21.608
Come on!

55:21.650 --> 55:23.766
- Ahhh, tough luck.

55:23.820 --> 55:27.108
Ah, geez, Sally is the winner.

55:27.150 --> 55:29.106
- Coming up to 50.

55:31.660 --> 55:33.275
- [Prince] Come along,
Pinky, hurry up.

55:33.330 --> 55:35.901
That's it, stupid
little sheep, hurry up.

55:37.160 --> 55:39.037
- Where did he come from?

55:39.080 --> 55:41.378
- Go, Prince, go!

55:41.420 --> 55:42.785
- Comes to 70!

55:42.840 --> 55:44.876
- [Prince] Hurry up,
or I'll bite you.

55:47.010 --> 55:48.125
Get in the pen,

55:48.170 --> 55:50.172
you disgusting
little woolly jumper.

55:50.220 --> 55:51.539
- Here comes 80!

55:51.590 --> 55:53.672
One, two, three!
- [Virginia] Pen's closed!

55:53.720 --> 55:55.802
- Virginia the Shepherdess

55:55.850 --> 55:57.920
is this year's winner.

55:57.980 --> 56:00.050
- No! No!

56:00.100 --> 56:03.649
No! (screams and whines)

56:03.690 --> 56:05.226
- [Voiceover] I never
thought I'd see the day

56:05.270 --> 56:07.022
when a Peep got beat.

56:07.070 --> 56:09.026
- Come and get your prize, lass.

56:09.070 --> 56:10.480
(loud cheers and clapping)

56:10.530 --> 56:11.906
- [Sally] No! No!

56:11.950 --> 56:15.078
(clapping and cheers)

56:19.710 --> 56:20.995
- Thank you very, very much.

56:21.040 --> 56:24.453
It was a team effort, no one
person could do it. Bye-bye.

56:26.750 --> 56:28.627
- You lied to me, Wilf.

56:28.670 --> 56:30.501
You said I couldn't fail to win.

56:30.550 --> 56:31.926
- That little weaks,

56:31.970 --> 56:33.585
must have got in
our well somehow.

56:33.640 --> 56:35.289
It's the only explanation.

56:35.350 --> 56:36.499
- You've made me look a fool

56:36.560 --> 56:39.518
in front of the whole village.

56:39.560 --> 56:42.017
I'm gonna make you
suffer for this, Wilf.

56:45.150 --> 56:48.222
(crying loudly)

56:56.200 --> 56:58.612
(growling loudly)

57:03.830 --> 57:05.491
- Come on, come on, come on.

57:05.540 --> 57:06.586
How_come it's not
showmg our world?

57:06.630 --> 57:07.619
- I don't know.

57:07.670 --> 57:08.625
- I was talking to Prince.

57:08.670 --> 57:10.160
- Because it's not turned on.

57:10.210 --> 57:12.462
There's probably a
secret catch somewhere.

57:12.510 --> 57:14.466
- He said it's
probably not turned on.

57:15.680 --> 57:17.636
Well how did you get through
it in the first place?

57:17.680 --> 57:18.920
- I fell on it.

57:18.970 --> 57:21.052
It can't be that hard to find.

57:21.100 --> 57:22.089
- [Tony] I don't.

57:23.390 --> 57:24.721
- [Virginia] What's this?

57:27.020 --> 57:28.567
It's Central Park.

57:28.610 --> 57:30.271
- That's Wollman Rink.

57:31.780 --> 57:33.941
- [Voiceover] Wolf! Wolf!

57:33.990 --> 57:36.652
(loud terrified scream)

57:37.950 --> 57:40.692
- Sally Peep's been murdered!

57:43.080 --> 57:44.991
Caught him red-handed!

57:45.040 --> 57:46.667
- [Wolf] How can you get
those sheep to decide?

57:46.710 --> 57:48.416
I didn't do nothin'.

57:48.460 --> 57:52.464
(angry screams and shouts)

57:58.140 --> 58:00.711
Oh, Virginia! Virginia!

58:02.350 --> 58:03.669
Virginia!

58:05.480 --> 58:07.857
I didn't do nothin'! Virginia!

58:07.900 --> 58:09.640
Virginia!

58:11.360 --> 58:15.524
(dramatic instrumental music)

58:27.630 --> 58:30.952
- Uh! Ah! Ahhh!

58:31.000 --> 58:32.911
- Are you all right?

58:32.960 --> 58:34.507
Your Majesty?

58:34.550 --> 58:39.089
- (moans loudly) Mirror.
Mirror. Find me a mirror.

58:39.140 --> 58:40.596
- Find a mirror!

58:42.970 --> 58:45.018
- That man is an idiot.

58:45.060 --> 58:47.221
He's causing me so much trouble.

58:48.770 --> 58:50.431
- You're dead.

58:50.480 --> 58:51.765
You hear me?

58:51.820 --> 58:53.606
Next time I see
you, you're dead.

58:53.650 --> 58:55.527
- Cease fighting immediately,

58:55.570 --> 58:56.696
or we will be overrun

58:56.740 --> 58:58.981
and we will lose this kingdom!

58:59.030 --> 59:00.520
Do you understand?

59:00.570 --> 59:02.902
(spits loudly)

59:02.950 --> 59:04.998
- I'm taking the kingdom.

59:05.040 --> 59:08.112
Then I'm coming for
you, you evil pig!

59:09.750 --> 59:12.378
_- To hold the Troll
King's latest advance,

59:12.420 --> 59:14.502
he's ravaging the kingdom.

59:14.550 --> 59:16.620
- It looks like
some awful disease.

59:16.670 --> 59:18.297
- Surely the trolls
are not strong enough

59:18.340 --> 59:20.672
to seize the entire kingdom.

59:20.720 --> 59:22.711
- Well who will stop them?

59:22.760 --> 59:25.342
If no_ one else will
say it then I Will.

59:25.390 --> 59:28.598
Where is Wendell in
our hour of need?

59:28.640 --> 59:30.346
Where is he?

59:30.400 --> 59:32.561
He was supposed to be performing

59:32.610 --> 59:35.602
prearranged acts of bravery
before his coronation,

59:35.650 --> 59:38.733
and now _there's a real
Cl'lSlS he's just run away.

59:41.570 --> 59:44.539
He's not fit to be king.

59:44.580 --> 59:46.901
Right that down. Put it down.

59:46.950 --> 59:47.996
Put it down!

59:48.040 --> 59:49.667
- Sirs, forgive me.

59:50.750 --> 59:52.786
I have the most dreadful news.

59:52.840 --> 59:54.205
- What is it?

59:54.250 --> 59:56.298
- Viscount Lansky's
horse has returned

59:56.340 --> 59:59.673
from the Great Forest riderless.

1:00:05.970 --> 1:00:09.053
- Gentlemen, we have
run out of options.

1:00:10.520 --> 1:00:13.648
We must accept
military assistance

1:00:13.690 --> 1:00:16.568
from the lst and 9th Kingdoms

1:00:16.610 --> 1:00:19.522
to protect our people.

1:00:19.570 --> 1:00:21.606
The price of their aid, however,

1:00:21.660 --> 1:00:25.152
is indeed high.

1:00:25.200 --> 1:00:27.657
The 4th Kingdom Will be
divided into quarters,

1:00:27.700 --> 1:00:32.490
and run by the council of the
Nine Kingdoms in perpetuity,

1:00:32.540 --> 1:00:35.373
and Wendell will
forego any chance

1:00:35.420 --> 1:00:37.706
of ever taking the throne.

1:00:37.760 --> 1:00:39.409
- No!

1:00:39.470 --> 1:00:42.837
No! I will not accept it.

1:00:44.390 --> 1:00:46.506
I've been planning
this coronation

1:00:46.560 --> 1:00:48.630
for three and a half years.

1:00:48.680 --> 1:00:51.092
- Oh, forget the
coronation, Lord Rupert,

1:00:51.140 --> 1:00:54.974
we must sign away sovereignty,
or lose everything.

1:00:57.730 --> 1:01:00.858
(loud, angry chants and yelling)

1:01:07.490 --> 1:01:09.867
- Virginia, there's
been a terrible mistake.

1:01:09.910 --> 1:01:12.538
- Look, Wolf. We're going home.

1:01:14.670 --> 1:01:17.707
- Oh, huff-puff, you can't.

1:01:18.880 --> 1:01:20.700
- Look, we don't belong here.

1:01:20.760 --> 1:01:22.159
- No.

1:01:22.220 --> 1:01:23.756
- And Whatever mess you've
gotten yourself into,

1:01:23.800 --> 1:01:25.176
it has nothing to do with us.

1:01:25.220 --> 1:01:28.462
(whimpering and crying)

1:01:28.510 --> 1:01:30.262
Please don't cry.

1:01:31.640 --> 1:01:35.144
Look, nothing you can say is
ever gonna change my mind.

1:01:35.190 --> 1:01:37.226
(whimpering)

1:01:42.360 --> 1:01:44.442
- Ah, that's home, Prince.

1:01:44.490 --> 1:01:46.367
- Well, it's not
home for me, Tony,

1:01:46.410 --> 1:01:47.866
and you can't possibly
think of going home

1:01:47.910 --> 1:01:50.538
While you remain my manservant.

1:01:50.580 --> 1:01:53.071
- All right, let's get
something straight,

1:01:53.120 --> 1:01:54.200
Your Royal Dogness,

1:01:54.250 --> 1:01:56.206
I am not your manservant.

1:01:58.380 --> 1:01:59.586
Ah-ha.

1:02:01.800 --> 1:02:03.540
So, did you break
the news to him?

1:02:03.590 --> 1:02:06.582
- Yes, well, sort of.

1:02:08.930 --> 1:02:10.636
- What sort of?

1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:14.559
- Sort of agreed
to represent him.

1:02:14.600 --> 1:02:15.510
- Virginia!

1:02:15.560 --> 1:02:17.471
- I don't think
he killed anybody.

1:02:17.520 --> 1:02:19.568
- That's What you want to think.

1:02:19.610 --> 1:02:21.475
There's a dead girl out there.

1:02:21.530 --> 1:02:23.270
It could have been you.

1:02:23.320 --> 1:02:26.278
He is a wolf. That's
What wolves do.

1:02:26.320 --> 1:02:28.697
- That's the first intelligent
thing you've said, Anthony.

1:02:28.740 --> 1:02:29.900
- Look, we have the mirror.

1:02:29.950 --> 1:02:31.577
We can go home anytime.

1:02:31.620 --> 1:02:33.281
- Right, so, let's go right now.

1:02:33.330 --> 1:02:35.537
Let's go right this minute
before we turn into giant pigs,

1:02:35.580 --> 1:02:37.070
or trampled by goblins,

1:02:37.120 --> 1:02:38.781
or whatever's next
in this mad house.

1:02:38.830 --> 1:02:42.618
- I am not going anywhere
until I try to help him.

1:02:42.670 --> 1:02:44.160
- How can?

1:02:53.310 --> 1:02:56.632
Help me hide this thing
under the straw in the wagon.

1:02:56.690 --> 1:02:58.681
You never used to be
this obstinate, you know?

1:02:58.730 --> 1:03:00.357
That's something
he's taught you.

1:03:00.400 --> 1:03:02.516
- Well, somebody
had to, didn't they?

1:03:09.240 --> 1:03:13.324
(light-hearted
instrumental music)

1:03:16.960 --> 1:03:18.575
- What are you wearing?

1:03:18.620 --> 1:03:20.247
- What? I have no choice.

1:03:20.290 --> 1:03:21.530
You have to.

1:03:21.590 --> 1:03:22.534
- You know, Virginia,
you don't know anything

1:03:22.590 --> 1:03:23.705
about the laws around here.

1:03:23.750 --> 1:03:24.455
As a matter of fact,

1:03:24.510 --> 1:03:25.659
you don't know anything

1:03:25.710 --> 1:03:26.586
about law at all.

1:03:26.630 --> 1:03:28.086
Maybe I should have
represented him.

1:03:28.130 --> 1:03:29.631
- Excuse me? Who got you
out of the parking tickets?

1:03:29.680 --> 1:03:32.638
Who took the Polaroid
of the broken meter?

1:03:32.680 --> 1:03:34.136
- Virginia, this
is a murder case.

1:03:34.180 --> 1:03:36.011
- Justice is universal.

1:03:37.520 --> 1:03:39.727
- Oh, it's no
good, it's no good.

1:03:39.770 --> 1:03:42.307
We've lost already,
my creamy counsel.

1:03:42.360 --> 1:03:44.521
The local jury is certain
to be biased against me.

1:03:44.570 --> 1:03:46.811
- Now that is what I
don't want to hear.

1:03:46.860 --> 1:03:48.646
Negative thinking.

1:03:49.990 --> 1:03:53.153
Any jury can be swayed,
all you need is a--

1:03:53.200 --> 1:03:55.486
(sheep baaing)

1:03:57.580 --> 1:03:59.036
Oh my God.

1:04:00.420 --> 1:04:04.993
(loud, angry shouts
and sheep baaing)

1:04:13.600 --> 1:04:16.967
- [Voiceover] All rise
for the Honorable Judge.

1:04:27.650 --> 1:04:31.234
- It gives me no pleasure to
sentence this wolf to death

1:04:31.280 --> 1:04:33.271
(loud sheep baaing)

1:04:33.320 --> 1:04:34.366
for the terrible crime--

1:04:34.410 --> 1:04:35.695
- Objection, Your Honor!

1:04:35.740 --> 1:04:37.867
We haven't heard
any eVIdence yet.

1:04:39.410 --> 1:04:43.323
- Oh, all right, well
then move it along.

1:04:43.380 --> 1:04:44.620
Nice and brisk, eh?

1:04:44.670 --> 1:04:46.956
- Ladies and
Gentlemen of the jury.

1:04:48.170 --> 1:04:51.549
Ewes and Rams.

1:04:51.590 --> 1:04:54.798
Before you leave
this courtroom today,

1:04:54.850 --> 1:04:58.638
I will not only have proved
my client's innocence

1:04:58.680 --> 1:05:00.921
beyond any reasonable doubt.

1:05:00.980 --> 1:05:02.129
Ow!

1:05:03.060 --> 1:05:06.223
But also unmasked
the real killer.

1:05:06.270 --> 1:05:08.181
- Just a pot of lemon tea

1:05:08.230 --> 1:05:11.643
and a slice of Rosie Peep's
ginger cake. Thank you.

1:05:11.700 --> 1:05:14.021
- Look at this poor
man before you.

1:05:14.070 --> 1:05:16.277
Is he a wolf? No!

1:05:16.330 --> 1:05:19.037
But he is a stranger,

1:05:19.080 --> 1:05:22.038
and stranger equals wolf,

1:05:22.080 --> 1:05:23.957
and wolf equals killer.

1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:25.536
Is that What we're saying?

1:05:25.580 --> 1:05:27.241
- Very well put.

1:05:27.290 --> 1:05:28.791
Now to the sentencing.

1:05:28.840 --> 1:05:32.162
- You Honor, I'm
only just beginning.

1:05:32.220 --> 1:05:34.882
I would like to call
my first Witness.

1:05:34.930 --> 1:05:37.342
Wilfred Peep.

1:05:37.390 --> 1:05:40.382
You saw my client running away
from the scene of the crime.

1:05:40.430 --> 1:05:41.636
Is that right?

1:05:41.680 --> 1:05:44.649
- Clear as daylight, it was him.

1:05:44.690 --> 1:05:45.588
No doubt about it.

1:05:45.650 --> 1:05:46.685
- Now jam!

1:05:46.730 --> 1:05:48.220
(shouts and angry screams)

1:05:48.270 --> 1:05:50.647
- Burn him! Burn him!

1:05:50.690 --> 1:05:52.851
- I'm wondering if
you can read this.

1:05:52.900 --> 1:05:55.653
- Of course I can, it says,

1:05:55.700 --> 1:05:57.816
No trespassin' according to--

1:05:57.870 --> 1:05:59.326
- Thank you.

1:06:02.410 --> 1:06:05.994
I wonder Mr. Peep, if
you can read it now.

1:06:06.040 --> 1:06:09.624
At the same distance you say
you clearly saw my client

1:06:09.670 --> 1:06:12.298
running away from
the murder scene.

1:06:12.340 --> 1:06:14.672
- According to Little Lamb
Village council ruling

1:06:14.720 --> 1:06:16.381
number seven-one-four B,

1:06:16.430 --> 1:06:18.045
by laW twenty-one A.

1:06:18.100 --> 1:06:19.636
- No further
questions, thank you.

1:06:19.680 --> 1:06:22.558
(laughing and jeering)

1:06:22.600 --> 1:06:25.478
- Oh, cripes! Oh.

1:06:25.520 --> 1:06:27.147
- We gotta do
something to help him.

1:06:27.190 --> 1:06:29.476
- He's a wolf.
What do you expect?

1:06:29.520 --> 1:06:32.068
He's only done exactly what
I said he'd do all along.

1:06:32.110 --> 1:06:33.896
- Well, Virginia
believes in him.

1:06:33.940 --> 1:06:35.646
And I believe in Virginia.

1:06:35.700 --> 1:06:38.567
- Nothing you can say
Will make me help him.

1:06:40.530 --> 1:06:42.441
- You wanna eat tonight?

1:06:44.330 --> 1:06:47.663
- Miss Peep, what
is your profession?

1:06:47.710 --> 1:06:49.496
- I'm a shepherdess.

1:06:49.540 --> 1:06:53.419
- Oh, a shepherdess,
or temptress?

1:06:53.460 --> 1:06:54.540
- Oh yeah, temptress.

1:06:54.590 --> 1:06:57.548
She's a temptress.
- [Miss Peep] I'm a good girl.

1:06:57.590 --> 1:07:00.923
That wolf came up to us girls,

1:07:00.970 --> 1:07:04.428
and he kept tryin' to touch us.

1:07:04.470 --> 1:07:06.051
And show us his tail.

1:07:06.100 --> 1:07:09.399
- Oh! That'a lie!
They provoked me.

1:07:09.440 --> 1:07:11.055
- Provoked you to What?

1:07:11.110 --> 1:07:15.228
- P-p-p-provoked me to nothing,

1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:17.236
but they sure were tryin'.

1:07:17.280 --> 1:07:20.659
(loud angry shouting)

1:07:20.700 --> 1:07:22.361
- Miss Peep!

1:07:22.410 --> 1:07:26.449
Miss Peep, I suggest
that you and Sally Peep

1:07:26.500 --> 1:07:29.537
were the easiest
shepherdesses in town.

1:07:29.580 --> 1:07:31.582
(loud angry shouting)

1:07:31.630 --> 1:07:34.292
- Are you suggesting that
an innocent young girl

1:07:34.340 --> 1:07:38.549
from this village might kiss
a man before she's married?

1:07:38.590 --> 1:07:41.844
- Well, a bit more
than that, Your Honor.

1:07:41.890 --> 1:07:44.597
- Oh, you try my patience.

1:07:44.640 --> 1:07:48.849
You are just this far from
being thrown on the bonfire

1:07:48.890 --> 1:07:51.518
With that filthy murdering wolf.

1:07:51.560 --> 1:07:53.937
(angry shouting)

1:07:58.570 --> 1:08:00.526
- Come on, What can you smell?

1:08:00.570 --> 1:08:03.027
- Your body odor.

1:08:03.080 --> 1:08:04.365
- Go on, you haven't even tried.

1:08:04.410 --> 1:08:05.616
Go on, see What you can smell.

1:08:05.660 --> 1:08:07.070
- Why don't you get
down on all fours

1:08:07.120 --> 1:08:09.281
and see What you can smell.

1:08:09.330 --> 1:08:11.742
It's mainly feet and
excrement at ground level,

1:08:11.790 --> 1:08:13.587
had that ever occurred to you?

1:08:13.630 --> 1:08:14.619
- Can you pick up a scent?

1:08:14.670 --> 1:08:16.501
- There's hundreds of scents.

1:08:16.550 --> 1:08:20.623
- Well, yes, but only a great
hunting Prince, like yourself,

1:08:20.680 --> 1:08:24.889
could distinguish that special
scent we're looking for.

1:08:24.930 --> 1:08:26.466
- Correct.

1:08:26.520 --> 1:08:28.260
' [Tony] You got it? Let's go!

1:08:30.520 --> 1:08:33.853
- How would you
describe Sally Peep?

1:08:33.900 --> 1:08:34.889
- Objection!

1:08:34.940 --> 1:08:38.569
- Sally? Very cute.

1:08:38.610 --> 1:08:40.942
Oh, succulent.

1:08:40.990 --> 1:08:45.279
Nice girl, a very tasty
little birdie, no mistake.

1:08:45.330 --> 1:08:46.695
- Nice enough to eat?

1:08:46.740 --> 1:08:48.037
- Oh, yes!

1:08:48.080 --> 1:08:49.320
(gasps of shock from the crowd)

1:08:49.370 --> 1:08:50.246
- What?

1:08:50.290 --> 1:08:51.450
- [Voiceover] He's shammin' us.

1:08:51.500 --> 1:08:54.958
- No! No, uh, I
didn't mean that.

1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:58.254
- She was asking for it,
is that What you're sayin'?

1:08:58.300 --> 1:08:59.585
- She was begging for it.

1:08:59.630 --> 1:09:02.212
I mean, she was gaggin' for it.

1:09:02.260 --> 1:09:04.922
No, no, no, I just meant
that some of these girls

1:09:04.970 --> 1:09:07.632
are very provocative.

1:09:07.680 --> 1:09:10.478
They know that a wolf, well,

1:09:10.520 --> 1:09:14.593
it's like thrusting a steak
in front of a starving man.

1:09:14.650 --> 1:09:16.186
- Is it indeed?

1:09:16.230 --> 1:09:17.936
- Oh, no! I didn't
mean that either.

1:09:17.980 --> 1:09:20.357
See, I'm twisting
everything I'm saying!

1:09:20.400 --> 1:09:22.607
- He's suffering from post
menstrual tension, Your Honor.

1:09:22.650 --> 1:09:24.777
- Post menstratense,
pe, Whatever it is.

1:09:24.820 --> 1:09:27.027
- The night before the murder,

1:09:27.080 --> 1:09:28.729
there was a hen house homicide

1:09:28.790 --> 1:09:32.362
resulting in the
death of ten chickens.

1:09:32.410 --> 1:09:33.661
Anything to do with you?

1:09:33.710 --> 1:09:34.870
- No, Sir.

1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:38.036
- You didn't kill
those chickens?

1:09:38.090 --> 1:09:39.205
- No, Sir!

1:09:39.250 --> 1:09:41.548
- You didn't go
near the hen house?

1:09:41.590 --> 1:09:43.000
- Absolutely not, Sir.

1:09:43.050 --> 1:09:46.087
- Then how do you explain this?

1:09:46.140 --> 1:09:48.677
That is a piece of your shirt

1:09:48.720 --> 1:09:52.349
recovered from inside
the Peep's chicken coop.

1:09:55.560 --> 1:09:58.017
- Oh, the chickens!

1:10:00.360 --> 1:10:01.679
Let me think.

1:10:05.200 --> 1:10:09.648
Yes, yes, I might've
eaten all the chickens.

1:10:09.700 --> 1:10:11.691
- And then you
killed Sally Peep.

1:10:11.750 --> 1:10:14.537
- Oh! A couple of drumsticks
doesn't make me a killer.

1:10:14.580 --> 1:10:16.457
I had chicken for
dinner, I admit it,

1:10:16.500 --> 1:10:18.627
but I _didn't touch
no girl! I swear!

1:10:18.670 --> 1:10:20.410
- Then Why did you lie?

1:10:20.460 --> 1:10:21.415
- Yes, Why did you lie?

1:10:21.460 --> 1:10:23.257
- Because if I said
yes to the chickens,

1:10:23.300 --> 1:10:25.712
then you're gonna think I
wolfed down the girl as well.

1:10:25.760 --> 1:10:28.547
- That is exactly What we think.

1:10:28.600 --> 1:10:30.465
- But I didn't do it!

1:10:30.510 --> 1:10:31.670
I didn't do it!

1:10:31.720 --> 1:10:33.051
Virginia, I swear!

1:10:33.100 --> 1:10:34.556
- Of course you didn't!

1:10:34.600 --> 1:10:36.056
(angry shouting)

1:10:36.100 --> 1:10:39.513
Of course he didn't do it!
Of course he didn't do it!

1:10:40.900 --> 1:10:44.313
But if he didn't
kill Sally Peep,

1:10:44.360 --> 1:10:45.520
then who did?

1:10:45.570 --> 1:10:46.650
- [Wolf] Who did?

1:10:46.700 --> 1:10:49.112
- I hear myself asking,

1:10:49.160 --> 1:10:50.320
myself,

1:10:51.490 --> 1:10:54.994
because the time has come

1:10:55.040 --> 1:10:58.874
for me to point the
finger at the real killer.

1:11:01.130 --> 1:11:02.586
Because,

1:11:05.470 --> 1:11:09.839
because last night there was
another man walking around

1:11:09.890 --> 1:11:11.801
dressed as a wolf.

1:11:11.850 --> 1:11:13.420
Yes! (laughs)

1:11:13.470 --> 1:11:16.598
The man in the wolf mask

1:11:16.640 --> 1:11:18.221
is the real killer.

1:11:19.940 --> 1:11:22.067
And that murdering
piece of filth

1:11:22.110 --> 1:11:25.102
is the one that should be
on this Witness stand now.

1:11:27.740 --> 1:11:31.483
- The honor of playing the
wolf in the annual fair,

1:11:31.530 --> 1:11:36.490
has always gone to an unimpeachable
member of our society.

1:11:36.540 --> 1:11:38.997
- I don't care, bring
this sleazebag in.

1:11:39.040 --> 1:11:40.325
Let me cross-examine him,

1:11:40.380 --> 1:11:42.450
and I guarantee we'll
have our murderer.

1:11:42.500 --> 1:11:45.913
- And When that honor
was bestowed on me

1:11:47.590 --> 1:11:49.467
last week.

1:11:49.510 --> 1:11:52.547
I was only too happy to accept.

1:11:52.600 --> 1:11:54.500
- I'm most dreadfully
sorry, Your Honor.

1:11:54.560 --> 1:11:57.131
(angry shouting and screaming)

1:12:02.230 --> 1:12:06.143
- (barks) Ah-ha,
the Peep's barn.

1:12:06.190 --> 1:12:08.818
(sniffing around)

1:12:08.860 --> 1:12:10.771
- Listen I, come
here, come here.

1:12:10.820 --> 1:12:11.696
I've been here, all right?

1:12:11.740 --> 1:12:12.900
I know about the well.

1:12:12.950 --> 1:12:14.326
- This is Where she came from.

1:12:14.370 --> 1:12:16.998
She was here just
before she was murdered.

1:12:17.040 --> 1:12:18.405
I can smell her here.

1:12:19.460 --> 1:12:21.325
- Members of the jury,

1:12:21.370 --> 1:12:22.826
you have heard the evidence,

1:12:22.880 --> 1:12:25.166
most of it quite ridiculous.

1:12:25.210 --> 1:12:26.416
- Some of it.

1:12:26.460 --> 1:12:28.121
- [Judge] Now those who
believe him innocent

1:12:28.170 --> 1:12:31.424
all go into the left-hand pen.

1:12:31.470 --> 1:12:33.791
Those Who know him to be guilty

1:12:33.850 --> 1:12:35.670
go into the right-hand pen.

1:12:35.720 --> 1:12:37.460
- The right-hand
pen is full of food.

1:12:37.520 --> 1:12:39.476
- [Wolf] Yeah,
it's full of food!

1:12:39.520 --> 1:12:43.149
(wailing)

1:12:43.190 --> 1:12:45.226
Oh, Gypsy was right.

1:12:45.270 --> 1:12:47.568
A girl dead, a wolf burns.

1:12:47.610 --> 1:12:48.986
Oh!

1:12:51.610 --> 1:12:54.522
- So what, if this is
Where Sally came from?

1:12:54.570 --> 1:12:56.322
I don't know what
you expect to find.

1:12:57.450 --> 1:12:58.826
The well.

1:12:58.870 --> 1:13:01.498
Somebody's destroyed
the magic well.

1:13:01.540 --> 1:13:02.450
Who would'v--

1:13:02.500 --> 1:13:03.876
- [Prince] Shh!

1:13:03.920 --> 1:13:05.785
I'm getting a new scent.

1:13:09.510 --> 1:13:12.377
- By a unanimous verdict,
I pronounce you guilty

1:13:12.430 --> 1:13:15.172
of murder most heinous.
- [Wolf] No, no!

1:13:15.220 --> 1:13:19.338
- I sentence you to be
burned at the stake.

1:13:21.140 --> 1:13:25.053
Let's do it right away before
the Marvelous Melon Contest.

1:13:26.520 --> 1:13:28.852
- No! Objection, Your Honor!

1:13:28.900 --> 1:13:30.731
That is not fair!

1:13:32.450 --> 1:13:35.567
(angry chants and screaming)

1:13:39.620 --> 1:13:40.939
Wolf!

1:13:43.500 --> 1:13:44.410
No!

1:13:44.460 --> 1:13:46.530
- I didn't do it!
I didn't do it!

1:13:50.590 --> 1:13:53.002
(gives a long, sad howl)

1:13:54.430 --> 1:13:55.499
- You cannot do this!

1:13:55.550 --> 1:13:57.632
You haven't given
him a fair trial.

1:13:57.680 --> 1:14:00.387
- Virginia, I want
you to remember me

1:14:00.430 --> 1:14:03.558
all nicely forever.

1:14:03.600 --> 1:14:07.513
- Seems only right that
family should do it, Wilf.

1:14:07.560 --> 1:14:09.608
- I'll burn him.

1:14:09.650 --> 1:14:11.686
- [Virginia] You
can't do this! No!

1:14:11.730 --> 1:14:13.561
(angry shouts and cheers)

1:14:13.610 --> 1:14:15.942
- Wait! Stop! Stop!

1:14:15.990 --> 1:14:19.482
Stop! Stop! Wolf did
not kill Sally Peep,

1:14:19.530 --> 1:14:21.407
and I can prove it.

1:14:21.450 --> 1:14:23.862
- Oh, he'll say anything.

1:14:23.910 --> 1:14:25.616
- No, no! listen to me.

1:14:25.670 --> 1:14:28.457
The Peep family has
cheated you for years.

1:14:28.500 --> 1:14:30.707
(angry shouts)

1:14:30.750 --> 1:14:32.547
They have their own magic well,

1:14:32.590 --> 1:14:34.217
and they stopped the
rest of you from getting

1:14:34.260 --> 1:14:36.125
any of the water.
- [Wilfred] It's a lie!

1:14:40.220 --> 1:14:42.632
- When Sally Peep
lost the competition,

1:14:42.680 --> 1:14:43.760
she wrecked your well.

1:14:43.810 --> 1:14:44.765
Didn't she, Wilfred?

1:14:44.810 --> 1:14:46.186
You found out What she did.

1:14:46.230 --> 1:14:47.549
You followed her
up into the fields,

1:14:47.600 --> 1:14:50.182
and you killed her, didn't you?

1:14:50.230 --> 1:14:51.720
- I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

1:14:51.770 --> 1:14:53.988
We don't have no magic well.

1:14:54.030 --> 1:14:55.270
- Why do you think

1:14:55.320 --> 1:14:56.901
they've one the competitions
year after year?

1:14:56.950 --> 1:14:58.269
Why do you think
their food tastes

1:14:58.320 --> 1:14:59.810
so much better than yours?

1:14:59.870 --> 1:15:01.610
- I believe him!

1:15:01.660 --> 1:15:04.367
You Peeps have cheated
us for too long.

1:15:04.410 --> 1:15:06.458
- Oh, where's the
proof to any of this?

1:15:06.500 --> 1:15:08.240
Prove that I killed Sally.

1:15:08.290 --> 1:15:09.530
- [Woman in Crowd]
Yes, go on, prove it!

1:15:09.580 --> 1:15:11.491
- [Man in Crowd] Yeah,
that's right, prove it!

1:15:11.540 --> 1:15:13.041
- Where's your coat, Wilfred?

1:15:13.090 --> 1:15:15.467
The one you were
wearing last night.

1:15:16.720 --> 1:15:18.335
(loud whistle)

1:15:20.550 --> 1:15:22.211
- [Man in Crowd] It's the dog!

1:15:22.260 --> 1:15:24.137
- [Man in Crowd]
He's got Wilf's coat.

1:15:24.180 --> 1:15:25.807
- [Woman in Crowd] Blood!

1:15:25.850 --> 1:15:27.306
Look, blood!

1:15:27.350 --> 1:15:28.897
- [Man in Crowd] Oh
my God, it's blood!

1:15:28.940 --> 1:15:31.761
(murmers and gasps of shock)

1:15:31.810 --> 1:15:33.391
- Poor, Sally, she wasn't
yelling wolf at all,

1:15:33.440 --> 1:15:34.566
was she, Wilfred?

1:15:34.610 --> 1:15:35.770
She was screaming your name.

1:15:35.820 --> 1:15:37.890
Wilf! Wilf!

1:15:39.450 --> 1:15:41.816
- She'd ruined the well.

1:15:41.870 --> 1:15:44.361
Dirty little vixen.

1:15:44.410 --> 1:15:46.901
It destroyed all of us.

1:15:46.960 --> 1:15:49.952
- You killed our Sally?

1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:52.742
(loud angry shouting)

1:15:56.510 --> 1:16:00.389
(dramatic instrumental music)

1:16:07.640 --> 1:16:09.596
- Oh, oh, my three friends!

1:16:09.640 --> 1:16:10.937
How can I ever thank you enough?

1:16:10.980 --> 1:16:12.686
You saved my bacon!

1:16:12.730 --> 1:16:14.391
Oh, thanks old chap.

1:16:14.440 --> 1:16:16.522
Oh, I owe you a very big bone!

1:16:16.570 --> 1:16:18.640
- [Prince] I'm actually disgusted
that you're still with us.

1:16:18.700 --> 1:16:21.442
You repulse me. Why did
I have to save your life?

1:16:21.490 --> 1:16:24.778
- Oh, yes, from now on
we are friends for life.

1:16:24.830 --> 1:16:27.822
And as for you, Virginia,
What a courtroom drama!

1:16:27.870 --> 1:16:30.282
- So, um, are you cured now?

1:16:30.330 --> 1:16:32.207
- Oh, completely,
back to my old self.

1:16:32.250 --> 1:16:33.535
- Yeah?

1:16:33.590 --> 1:16:34.909
- I can't remember much about
it, to tell you the truth,

1:16:34.960 --> 1:16:36.791
but I do remember
that you and Tony

1:16:36.840 --> 1:16:39.217
both laid down
your lives for me.

1:16:39.260 --> 1:16:41.581
It was the most amazing
thing. So dramatic.

1:16:41.630 --> 1:16:44.508
- Wha? What happened
to the wagon?

1:16:44.550 --> 1:16:45.801
- [Virginia] And our mirror?

1:16:45.850 --> 1:16:49.809
- Oh, my son John, he's just
takin' his pigs to market.

1:16:49.850 --> 1:16:51.431
Left a couple of hours ago.

1:16:53.100 --> 1:16:54.647
- Oh, which way and how far?

1:16:54.690 --> 1:16:57.602
- Well, it's not a journey
you'd wanna make on foot.

1:17:00.610 --> 1:17:04.364
(soft instrumental music)

1:17:22.260 --> 1:17:25.502
(chatter from crowd)

1:17:25.550 --> 1:17:26.881
- Told ya I didn't do it.

1:17:28.600 --> 1:17:31.228
Did you enjoy your
stay in our village?

1:17:31.270 --> 1:17:32.806
- Not exactly.

1:17:32.850 --> 1:17:36.559
- Wish I could remember
Who that dog reminds me of.

1:17:36.610 --> 1:17:38.396
- Let me make a suggestion.

1:17:38.440 --> 1:17:40.431
Prince Wendell, your ruler.

1:17:40.490 --> 1:17:43.357
- (laughs) Prince Wendell?

1:17:43.400 --> 1:17:45.027
Don't be so daft.

1:17:46.370 --> 1:17:48.941
No, it was a puppy I once knew

1:17:48.990 --> 1:17:51.493
called Mr. Fleas.

1:17:51.540 --> 1:17:54.532
- Ah, splendid, Mr. Fleas.

1:17:54.580 --> 1:17:56.241
Anthony can we
leave this village?

1:17:56.290 --> 1:17:58.838
One idiot in our
group is quite enough.

1:17:58.880 --> 1:18:00.120
- Let's go.

1:18:00.170 --> 1:18:01.876
- Aren't you gonna
make a wish then?

1:18:01.920 --> 1:18:04.002
- Why don't you make it for us?

1:18:05.390 --> 1:18:06.539
- Bye.

1:18:10.140 --> 1:18:11.710
(water splashes)

1:18:11.770 --> 1:18:15.729
It sounds like our well's
getting some water back in it.

1:18:15.770 --> 1:18:17.647
Oh, joy!

1:18:17.690 --> 1:18:19.726
(loud bell rings)

1:18:19.770 --> 1:18:23.183
Oh, yea! Oh, yea!

1:18:23.240 --> 1:18:25.811
The water's back on!

1:18:27.620 --> 1:18:30.908
(whimsical flute playing)

1:18:30.950 --> 1:18:34.454
(happy instrumental music)

1:18:36.250 --> 1:18:37.490
Finally!

1:18:37.540 --> 1:18:42.500
I am a complete idiot! (laughs)

1:18:43.970 --> 1:18:47.087
(cheering and happy shouting)

1:18:52.270 --> 1:18:54.340
- Ask yourself these questions.

1:18:54.390 --> 1:18:56.551
Do you frequently
conceal your emotions?

1:18:56.600 --> 1:18:58.477
Do you feel like you do
everything for other people

1:18:58.520 --> 1:19:00.397
and then resent it?

1:19:00.440 --> 1:19:02.931
- Everyday in every way,

1:19:02.980 --> 1:19:05.483
I am becoming a
new and better man.

1:19:05.530 --> 1:19:07.907
- I'm on the final page
of the final chapter

1:19:07.950 --> 1:19:09.486
of my final book.

1:19:09.530 --> 1:19:12.408
I now totally understand
women, top to bottom.

1:19:13.750 --> 1:19:16.321
I have perfected a technique
of not looking at her

1:19:16.370 --> 1:19:18.452
all the time.

1:19:18.500 --> 1:19:21.663
It's been very difficult,
but I think I've succeeded.

1:19:21.710 --> 1:19:23.337
- I am listening to my emotions

1:19:23.380 --> 1:19:25.541
and I am at one With myself.

1:19:26.840 --> 1:19:29.081
- [Prince] Hang on, I haven't
finished that page yet.

1:19:29.140 --> 1:19:30.459
Turn back.

1:19:33.680 --> 1:19:36.513
- I've managed to stop
my tongue from lolling

1:19:36.560 --> 1:19:38.471
When she arouses me.

1:19:38.520 --> 1:19:41.148
I've transformed
myself into a new man

1:19:41.190 --> 1:19:45.399
and soon she Will
be mine. (panting)

1:19:55.540 --> 1:19:58.657
(happy whimsical music)

1:20:04.170 --> 1:20:06.206
- [Tony] Where exactly are we?

1:20:06.260 --> 1:20:08.216
- [Wolf] We have entered
the most romantic town

1:20:08.260 --> 1:20:10.330
in the whole of the Nine
Kingdoms, the Kissing Town,

1:20:10.380 --> 1:20:13.178
Where everyone falls in love.

1:20:13.220 --> 1:20:15.302
Truly, fate has led us here.

1:20:15.350 --> 1:20:16.419
- [Virginia] Dream on.

1:20:16.470 --> 1:20:17.926
- You'll see.

1:20:17.980 --> 1:20:19.299
- [Tony] Yeah, well we
didn't come here for that.

1:20:19.350 --> 1:20:21.181
We came for the
mirror, all right?

1:20:26.150 --> 1:20:29.028
- Hello, I've been
looking for you all day.

1:20:29.070 --> 1:20:32.062
I can see love and
fortune coming your way.

1:20:32.110 --> 1:20:33.270
- Well.
- [Tony] Well,

1:20:33.320 --> 1:20:34.480
_ it's slice the _
frUItcake time again.

1:20:34.530 --> 1:20:36.157
- Dad.

1:20:36.200 --> 1:20:40.455
- Great romance, great love,
before this very night is out.

1:20:40.500 --> 1:20:42.456
- Ah, which one of
us breaks the money?

1:20:42.500 --> 1:20:44.377
- Your aura is cloudy.

1:20:44.420 --> 1:20:46.297
Just give me a couple of coins.

1:20:46.340 --> 1:20:48.046
- A couple? Ah, it's
the old cloudy aura bit.

1:20:48.090 --> 1:20:49.000
What are you doing?

1:20:49.050 --> 1:20:51.211
Ah, you have such a soft touch.

1:20:51.260 --> 1:20:55.503
- Yes, soft, sensuous,
creamy touch.

1:20:55.560 --> 1:20:57.300
- Now, if you look over there,

1:20:57.350 --> 1:21:00.228
you might find what you're
looking for. Good bye.

1:21:02.940 --> 1:21:05.898
- Wait, look, look,
that's the pig wagon.

1:21:05.940 --> 1:21:07.521
The one the mirror was in.

1:21:07.570 --> 1:21:08.639
It was, wasn't it?

1:21:08.690 --> 1:21:10.396
- How did she know that?

1:21:10.440 --> 1:21:12.601
- Yeah, come on,
come on, come on.

1:21:16.080 --> 1:21:16.739
There's nothin'.

1:21:16.780 --> 1:21:17.610
Oh, is this yours?

1:21:17.660 --> 1:21:18.866
Where's our mirror?

1:21:18.910 --> 1:21:20.571
- I didn't know it
was yours, now did I?

1:21:20.620 --> 1:21:21.700
- Where is it?

1:21:21.750 --> 1:21:22.819
- You wouldn't
want it now anyway,

1:21:22.870 --> 1:21:24.371
it's covered in pig filth.

1:21:24.420 --> 1:21:25.284
- Where is it?

1:21:25.330 --> 1:21:27.412
- I don't rightly know.

1:21:27.460 --> 1:21:28.620
- What?

1:21:28.670 --> 1:21:30.456
- Fellow gave me five
coppers for it this mornin'.

1:21:30.510 --> 1:21:32.501
- Five coppers? What fella?

1:21:32.550 --> 1:21:33.710
- I don't know.

1:21:33.760 --> 1:21:35.466
Passing threw With a Wheelbarrow
full of briclq-brack.

1:21:35.510 --> 1:21:37.307
Probably comin' from
the antiques market.

1:21:37.350 --> 1:21:38.499
- Briclq?

1:21:38.560 --> 1:21:41.472
- You'll never find
it now, Anthony.

1:21:41.520 --> 1:21:42.384
- We're not--

1:21:42.440 --> 1:21:44.681
- This place is
full of old things.

1:21:44.730 --> 1:21:46.550
You'd do best to split up.

1:21:46.610 --> 1:21:48.180
- Yeah.

1:21:48.230 --> 1:21:50.061
- [Driver] Shame you won't have
any time for romance though.

1:21:53.610 --> 1:21:54.690
- [Wolf] Bricky-brack.

1:21:54.740 --> 1:21:56.480
- Briclq-brack, briclq-brack.

1:21:58.530 --> 1:22:02.409
(sinister instrumental music)

1:22:34.570 --> 1:22:36.106
You know something?

1:22:36.160 --> 1:22:37.445
I'll tell you, your trouble
is that you've not had to do

1:22:37.490 --> 1:22:38.775
a hard day's work
your entire life.

1:22:38.820 --> 1:22:40.196
- [Prince] What
would you know about

1:22:40.240 --> 1:22:41.696
the suffering of royalty?

1:22:41.740 --> 1:22:43.867
You seem to have been
some kind of cleaner

1:22:43.910 --> 1:22:45.150
in your world.

1:22:45.210 --> 1:22:47.166
- Y-y-yeah, What's wrong
With that, all right?

1:22:47.210 --> 1:22:49.496
Nothing shameful about cleaning.

1:22:49.540 --> 1:22:50.996
And I had money once.

1:22:51.050 --> 1:22:51.664
You know that?

1:22:51.710 --> 1:22:53.291
I was rich.

1:22:53.340 --> 1:22:55.331
- You? (laughs) Rich?

1:22:55.380 --> 1:22:58.292
- Yes, yes, I had a
thriving plastics business.

1:22:58.340 --> 1:22:59.921
I was makin' 55 grand a year

1:22:59.970 --> 1:23:01.676
When I was 21 years old.

1:23:01.720 --> 1:23:04.473
- Ah, so let me guess,
you lost it all?

1:23:07.560 --> 1:23:10.393
I put all my money into an
idea that just didn't pan out.

1:23:10.440 --> 1:23:11.930
- And What was that?

1:23:14.320 --> 1:23:15.696
- Bouncy castles.

1:23:17.360 --> 1:23:19.772
We had the Robin and Maid
Marian, Jolly Jester,

1:23:19.820 --> 1:23:22.152
the Haunted Castle.

1:23:22.200 --> 1:23:23.906
You know, we had the
Cowboy and Indian Bouncer,

1:23:23.950 --> 1:23:25.747
one of our most popular items.

1:23:25.790 --> 1:23:27.280
And then the ZigZag Bouncer,

1:23:27.330 --> 1:23:29.241
our motto was, "Put the
Bounce Back in Your Life."

1:23:29.290 --> 1:23:31.872
- Ah, please stop, Anthony.

1:23:31.920 --> 1:23:34.377
Oh, no, it can't be.

1:23:34.420 --> 1:23:36.502
- [Tony] The trolls.

1:23:36.550 --> 1:23:38.927
- Not a very attractive
work, I'll grant you,

1:23:38.970 --> 1:23:43.589
but full of vitality
and life, frozen rage.

1:23:43.640 --> 1:23:45.551
Does it tickle your fancy?

1:23:45.600 --> 1:23:47.636
- Not even a little bit.

1:23:47.690 --> 1:23:50.432
Actually though, I am
looking for a mirror.

1:23:50.480 --> 1:23:52.436
It's about my height, black.

1:23:52.480 --> 1:23:55.278
- I seem to remember
a job lot of junk.

1:23:55.320 --> 1:23:56.526
It's in there.

1:24:01.450 --> 1:24:02.690
- [Virginia] Wolf,
do you really think

1:24:02.740 --> 1:24:04.617
we're gonna find
the mirror here?

1:24:04.660 --> 1:24:06.787
I think we should
get back to town.

1:24:06.830 --> 1:24:08.366
- Remember the
story of Snow White

1:24:08.410 --> 1:24:10.037
When she swallowed
the poison apple,

1:24:10.080 --> 1:24:11.490
and everyone thought
she was dead?

1:24:11.540 --> 1:24:12.746
- Mm-hmm.

1:24:12.790 --> 1:24:13.836
- Well, the Seven Dwarfs,
they brought her here

1:24:13.880 --> 1:24:15.199
and put her in a glass coffin

1:24:15.250 --> 1:24:16.501
in the hopes
- [Virginia] Here?

1:24:16.550 --> 1:24:18.256
- That someone might be able
to bring her back to life.

1:24:18.300 --> 1:24:19.426
- In this town?

1:24:19.470 --> 1:24:20.619
- To the top of this very hill.

1:24:20.680 --> 1:24:22.636
The Prince's grandmother.

1:24:24.560 --> 1:24:26.710
- [Virginia] Oh my God, look.

1:24:26.770 --> 1:24:28.840
Is this the real glass coffin?

1:24:31.520 --> 1:24:32.396
I don't know what it is,

1:24:32.440 --> 1:24:35.068
I just feel so good.

1:24:35.110 --> 1:24:37.431
(laughs) I don't
know what it is.

1:24:37.490 --> 1:24:39.606
- We all do.

1:24:39.650 --> 1:24:41.606
Everyone does in
the Kissing Town.

1:24:43.200 --> 1:24:45.156
Excuse me, excuse me.

1:24:50.870 --> 1:24:52.280
- That's it.

1:24:52.330 --> 1:24:54.457
That's it, that's it, that's it.

1:24:54.500 --> 1:24:56.991
- Shh, don't attract attention.

1:24:58.460 --> 1:25:01.213
- Look at that, ten
to fifteen gold coins.

1:25:01.260 --> 1:25:02.966
It's priced really low.

1:25:03.010 --> 1:25:05.888
Nobody knows what it is.

1:25:05.930 --> 1:25:07.966
_ - Don't turn it on
in here, you moron.

1:25:08.020 --> 1:25:09.476
Everyone will see.

1:25:12.940 --> 1:25:16.478
- Hmm, What do you think?

1:25:16.520 --> 1:25:19.102
- Oh, what? This? Oh, no I,

1:25:19.150 --> 1:25:21.357
I wouldn't even waste my time,

1:25:21.400 --> 1:25:23.152
just a piece of junk.

1:25:23.200 --> 1:25:25.771
- At first I thought
it was a reproduction.

1:25:25.830 --> 1:25:27.821
Late Naked Emperor, at best,

1:25:27.870 --> 1:25:31.909
but I think it's older than
that, quite a lot older.

1:25:31.960 --> 1:25:35.452
Maybe even early Cinderellan,

1:25:35.500 --> 1:25:38.082
and quite a lot more special.

1:25:39.510 --> 1:25:41.831
- Ah, right, so, Miss Snow White

1:25:41.880 --> 1:25:45.509
is lying here for years and
everyone thinks she's dead.

1:25:45.550 --> 1:25:47.677
Close your eyes.

1:25:47.720 --> 1:25:49.130
Slow down your breathing,

1:25:49.180 --> 1:25:52.513
so your chest is almost
not moving at all.

1:25:52.560 --> 1:25:54.721
That's nice.

1:25:54.770 --> 1:25:57.853
And all these handsome
chaps come along,

1:25:57.900 --> 1:25:59.436
and try to bring her around,

1:25:59.480 --> 1:26:02.483
but none of them were
good enough for her.

1:26:02.530 --> 1:26:03.394
You know what I mean?

1:26:03.450 --> 1:26:05.657
- Mmm. (laughs)

1:26:05.700 --> 1:26:07.361
- And then one day,

1:26:08.950 --> 1:26:13.705
this drop dead gorgeous
prince comes past,

1:26:15.420 --> 1:26:18.912
and he stops and thinks,

1:26:18.960 --> 1:26:23.124
Oh, what a quirlq girl.

1:26:23.170 --> 1:26:25.468
What a sweetie-pie.

1:26:27.260 --> 1:26:29.888
But she's frozen, cold.

1:26:31.640 --> 1:26:33.346
She resists his every call

1:26:33.390 --> 1:26:36.848
With her frozen countenance,

1:26:36.900 --> 1:26:41.143
and he realizes
that the only way

1:26:41.190 --> 1:26:43.021
he can melt this ice queen

1:26:43.070 --> 1:26:46.813
is to massage the life

1:26:46.860 --> 1:26:50.648
back into her soft, creamy lips

1:26:53.250 --> 1:26:54.615
mmam$.

1:26:59.880 --> 1:27:01.586
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

1:27:01.630 --> 1:27:03.507
Would you two stop
clowning around?

1:27:03.550 --> 1:27:05.415
I found the mirror. Come on!

1:27:17.270 --> 1:27:19.602
It was right here. It was
right here. It's gone.

1:27:19.650 --> 1:27:21.106
It's gone. Hey, wait! Hey, hey!

1:27:21.150 --> 1:27:23.357
The mirror that was
here, Where is it?

1:27:23.400 --> 1:27:24.810
- Oh, you mean the magic mirror?

1:27:24.860 --> 1:27:25.519
- The?

1:27:25.570 --> 1:27:26.776
- What a find.

1:27:26.820 --> 1:27:29.368
We're all tremendously
excited about it.

1:27:29.410 --> 1:27:30.399
It's in there.

1:27:30.450 --> 1:27:32.361
- Oh, okay, it's in there.

1:27:34.330 --> 1:27:37.493
(foreboding instrumental music)

1:27:43.460 --> 1:27:45.621
- Now it's five thousand?

1:27:49.050 --> 1:27:50.881
- We'll never raise that.

1:27:58.480 --> 1:28:00.220
I'm wishing on a

1:28:00.270 --> 1:28:04.354
Star

1:28:04.400 --> 1:28:06.527
To follow Where you

1:28:06.570 --> 1:28:10.108
Are

1:28:11.320 --> 1:28:13.402
I'm wishing on a

1:28:13.450 --> 1:28:17.238
Dream

1:28:18.330 --> 1:28:20.070
To follow What it

1:28:20.120 --> 1:28:23.374
Means

1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:26.661
And I Wish on all the

1:28:26.710 --> 1:28:29.258
Rainbows

1:28:29.300 --> 1:28:31.461
That I see

1:28:31.510 --> 1:28:34.422
I wish on all the people

1:28:34.470 --> 1:28:36.552
Who

1:28:36.600 --> 1:28:39.262
Really dream

1:28:44.980 --> 1:28:46.641
I'm wishing on a

1:28:46.690 --> 1:28:49.648
Star
