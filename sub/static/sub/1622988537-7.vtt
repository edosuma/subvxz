WEBVTT

00:20.312 --> 00:21.813
Okay. Ah, man.

00:28.904 --> 00:32.115
-Hi. Hi.
-Nice.

00:32.198 --> 00:35.118
-Nice, nice.
-I know. It's sort of ridiculous, but--

00:35.202 --> 00:38.914
Yeah. Well, where else are we gonna
have a kid-free conversation?

00:39.498 --> 00:43.919
-In a kid's playroom of course.
-Right. Yeah, well, the irony is not lost.

00:45.462 --> 00:48.715
Right, look. So I sent off
the water sample from the island.

00:48.799 --> 00:52.553
You know, so, hopefully we'll find out
the results and if it's dangerous or not.

00:53.804 --> 00:55.806
Do you think we should report it or--

00:57.474 --> 00:58.475
No.

00:58.559 --> 01:02.104
No, I don't. I think we should wait
until we know what we're dealing with.

01:02.187 --> 01:04.897
-Okay.
-I should never have taken her out there.

01:04.982 --> 01:07.234
Honestly, it was stupid, you know?

01:07.317 --> 01:08.902
-I mean, it was so dangerous.
-Hey.

01:08.986 --> 01:11.905
-I don't even know what I was thinking.
-Come on. Come here.

01:13.198 --> 01:14.199
Come here.

01:14.283 --> 01:15.701
Oh, man.

01:19.246 --> 01:21.290
You two really are cut
from the same cloth.

01:21.373 --> 01:24.459
Yeah, which is why
I should've set a better example.

01:24.543 --> 01:28.046
No, really. You know, we said no Richie,
that that's bad for her mental health.

01:28.130 --> 01:31.383
Then I go taking her out looking for
some secret that he knew 30 years ago.

01:31.466 --> 01:34.094
-No, I should've been home with my dad.
-No.

01:34.178 --> 01:37.472
If anything happened to him or to Ginny,
I would never be able to forgive myself.

01:37.556 --> 01:39.600
But it didn't.
Nothing bad happened to them.

01:40.767 --> 01:46.940
I think you're under
a lot of stress right now.

01:50.319 --> 01:51.820
Are you gonna be okay?

01:51.904 --> 01:53.697
Yeah, Bridge, come on.

01:54.198 --> 01:55.616
I'll be fine. I'll be okay.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.410
Hey, come on. I'll be okay.

02:02.414 --> 02:04.124
Come on. We should get back inside.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.044
-Ginny!
-What are you doing? Stop!

02:07.127 --> 02:09.545
-Oh, God.
-No, Hilde, that's mine.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.507
-Ginny, stop. Seriously.
-Do we have to?

02:11.590 --> 02:14.843
Hey, what are you doing?
Give it back to me. Stop!

02:14.927 --> 02:17.221
Please step away from the water.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.555
It may be poisonous.

02:19.556 --> 02:20.557
Hilde?

02:21.475 --> 02:22.768
I mean it.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.312
Really? Poisoned?

02:26.480 --> 02:29.191
I saw something leaking
into the water at the island.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.777
I think it might be why Walter's sick.

02:34.738 --> 02:36.657
I don't want you exposed to that too.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.535
Does that mean
I don't have to brush my teeth?

02:39.618 --> 02:43.705
Hold on. While Dad is waiting
for the water results to come back,

02:43.789 --> 02:47.251
we need to use this test
to make sure it's safe.

02:50.587 --> 02:53.173
If these squares turn dark,
we're in trouble.

02:53.257 --> 02:56.051
If they stay light, we're good.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.809
And then just watch
for three more seconds.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.769
One, two, three.

03:06.395 --> 03:07.396
Yay!

03:11.567 --> 03:13.151
You can brush your teeth now.

03:13.235 --> 03:14.319
Then, boo.

03:15.445 --> 03:18.073
Mom? Dad?

03:21.743 --> 03:23.787
Mom! Someone's here.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.049
What are you doing here?

03:36.800 --> 03:38.218
Hilde, I'm sorry.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.596
I'm taking you in.

03:45.475 --> 03:48.604
Hey, Hilde? Who's there?
Everything okay?

04:14.838 --> 04:17.507
Criminal trespassing.

04:18.175 --> 04:20.469
On a Sunday? A school night?

04:20.552 --> 04:21.553
That's--

04:22.262 --> 04:25.349
What's that word lawyers say
when they think you're lying?

04:25.432 --> 04:27.976
-Conjecture.
-That's conjecture.

04:28.060 --> 04:31.605
If you have to take my mug shot,
please just get my good side.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.732
Will you excuse me for a moment?

04:43.158 --> 04:45.577
That island you toured
was private property.

04:45.661 --> 04:48.497
What I'm still trying to figure out
is how you all got out there.

04:49.790 --> 04:53.293
Hello?
I know the boat didn't drive itself.

04:54.461 --> 04:57.923
I have my boating license. My permit,
on the other hand, is forthcoming.

04:59.258 --> 05:01.051
That's not how it works.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.596
Yeah, I brought the kids out there.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.182
Yeah, it was supposed to be
an educational field trip.

05:07.266 --> 05:09.977
We had no way of knowing
it was even private property.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.688
Unfortunately, that's not what
the owners are saying.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.358
Wott Management owns that land.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.944
-Oh, Trip.
-I know. Believe me.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.905
The last thing I want
is to be doing their bidding.

05:21.989 --> 05:25.951
But they brought us hard evidence
of you trespassing.

05:26.034 --> 05:28.203
Each kid will pay a ticket.

05:28.287 --> 05:31.081
And, Matt, since you're the adult,

05:31.164 --> 05:33.000
they may wanna press charges.

05:33.876 --> 05:36.378
Wait. What evidence do they have?

05:39.464 --> 05:40.632
This drone.

05:40.716 --> 05:42.634
I've never seen that before in my life.

05:47.931 --> 05:50.601
-Where'd you get a drone?
-Is that my drone?

05:56.231 --> 05:57.858
I told you we'd find it.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.527
-That belongs to us.
-Actually, it's evidence.

06:00.611 --> 06:02.196
I can't give it back to you yet.

06:02.279 --> 06:04.865
You took my drone
to record yourselves breaking the law?

06:11.121 --> 06:12.122
Honey.

06:12.539 --> 06:15.834
Sorry we couldn't just, like,
hang out in my room like normal people.

06:15.918 --> 06:18.086
It's just--
I wanted to talk to you in private,

06:18.170 --> 06:21.089
and that's literally impossible
at my house, so.

06:21.173 --> 06:24.843
It's okay. What's wrong?
You sounded upset.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.683
Emma told me that she likes me.

06:33.227 --> 06:36.188
Like, "likes" likes you?

06:40.984 --> 06:42.569
Well, what did you say back?

06:43.779 --> 06:47.991
Well, I don't know, nothing.
I didn't really know what to say.

06:48.492 --> 06:51.703
And then we realized
that my grandpa was gone, so...

06:53.664 --> 06:57.334
So, what? Are you breaking up with me?

06:58.085 --> 07:02.589
What? No. I mean, I just--
I just don't know what to do.

07:04.174 --> 07:08.512
Tell her that you're my girlfriend,
that you're not into her like that.

07:08.595 --> 07:11.014
Ethan, I don't wanna hurt her feelings.
She's my friend.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.349
No, she's not.

07:13.517 --> 07:15.894
She wants to date you.
She doesn't wanna be friends.

07:15.978 --> 07:18.021
What,
so you're saying if we weren't dating,

07:18.105 --> 07:19.940
-you wouldn't wanna be my friend?
-No.

07:21.859 --> 07:25.571
Well, now it sort of feels like
you're asking me to choose, you or her.

07:26.196 --> 07:29.074
Well, I mean, she likes you.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.742
So, I guess...

07:31.785 --> 07:33.620
yeah, I am.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.005
And they're not...

07:44.464 --> 07:46.884
I'm happy to help you fight the tickets.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.887
Yeah, you know, I've been
in this situation before as a reporter.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.889
I'm telling you, man,
it always blows over.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.891
Hold up. This has happened to you before?

07:53.974 --> 07:56.602
Well, next time,
how about you leave my son out of it?

07:57.603 --> 07:58.854
I'm sorry.

07:58.937 --> 08:01.523
Don't worry, guys.
This won't slow us down.

08:02.774 --> 08:03.775
Excuse me?

08:03.859 --> 08:06.778
Did you not hear anything they said?
I'm not gonna get the drone back.

08:06.862 --> 08:09.573
-And we each have to pay a ticket.
-My dad's gonna kill me.

08:09.656 --> 08:12.743
And what am I gonna tell my mom?
She already pulled a double shift today.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.454
-Is there anything I can do?
-No.

08:15.537 --> 08:17.497
All right, you two, let's go.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.795
-Dad, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--
-Hey. It's okay.

08:23.879 --> 08:26.006
We can talk about this
when we get home, all right?

08:26.089 --> 08:29.468
Still nothing from Izzy.
She just said, "Be home soon."

08:29.551 --> 08:30.552
Oh, man.

08:30.636 --> 08:33.429
Man, man, man. She picked the wrong night
to pull a stunt like this.

08:33.514 --> 08:34.681
I know.

08:34.765 --> 08:36.933
Well, we're lucky Kim was able to babysit.

08:37.017 --> 08:40.520
Wait. You told her not to mention
any of this to Frank yet, right?

08:41.020 --> 08:42.022
All right, good.

08:42.105 --> 08:43.941
I don't think they know he was there.

08:44.024 --> 08:47.528
Hey, Hilde?
Hey, you wanna come out here?

08:54.159 --> 08:59.206
Look, Trip has managed
to convince Wott to let go of the charges.

08:59.289 --> 09:02.751
But only if you promise
not to publish anything about this.

09:03.377 --> 09:06.672
Dad, no.
They're trying to buy our silence.

09:06.755 --> 09:09.466
-Hilde, I--
-Look, I did my best.

09:09.550 --> 09:13.345
But I'm a law enforcement officer,
and you guys broke the law.

09:13.428 --> 09:16.181
You're not just any officer.
You're the sheriff.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.560
Why are you helping them?

09:20.644 --> 09:22.980
Do you think this is
what I wanna be doing?

09:23.063 --> 09:26.942
Helping some horrible company
punish my friend?

09:27.651 --> 09:30.696
Look, I wish I could look the other way,

09:30.779 --> 09:33.949
but that's not how this department works,
not anymore.

09:34.032 --> 09:38.954
Now look, I don't want you to stop asking
questions and looking for the truth,

09:39.037 --> 09:40.622
but you did something illegal.

09:40.706 --> 09:43.750
And like it or not,
there have to be consequences.

09:45.544 --> 09:46.712
I understand.

09:46.795 --> 09:48.797
Yeah, we'll pay the ticket.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.348
But I'm not gonna stop reporting.

10:08.150 --> 10:10.068
Izzy still hasn't texted back.

10:10.152 --> 10:12.237
This is like the tenth message I've sent.

10:12.988 --> 10:16.700
We're gonna have to stop Hilde running
that story about the island, right?

10:17.201 --> 10:20.746
I mean, whatever they're doing,
they definitely wanna keep that quiet.

10:20.829 --> 10:23.999
You know what? Fifteen years ago,
I would've spent the night in jail

10:24.082 --> 10:26.293
before walking away
from a story like that.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.962
Well, we have no idea
what these people are capable of.

10:29.046 --> 10:30.464
We need to be careful.

10:32.508 --> 10:35.594
Hey! Excuse me.
Do you have any idea what time it is?

10:35.677 --> 10:37.471
Yeah, where the hell have you been?

10:37.554 --> 10:39.806
Your sister got hauled
into the sheriff's station.

10:39.890 --> 10:41.934
We had no idea where you were.

10:42.226 --> 10:44.269
Wow, okay, cool.
So let me get this straight.

10:44.353 --> 10:47.439
Hilde got arrested, but I'm the one
in trouble because I came home late?

10:47.523 --> 10:50.817
-You're not in trouble because of Hilde.
-No, no! I had a horrible night, okay?

10:50.901 --> 10:54.530
And I have no privacy in this house to
have one serious conversation with anyone!

10:54.613 --> 10:56.782
And you have no idea
what I'm dealing with right now!

10:56.865 --> 10:59.034
Okay, we wanna know
what you're dealing with.

10:59.117 --> 11:00.536
We were just worried about you.

11:00.619 --> 11:03.705
Okay, Mom, I'm really sorry,
but I couldn't find you guys,

11:03.789 --> 11:05.624
and I knew it was gonna be really quick,

11:05.707 --> 11:07.584
and I just really needed to see Ethan,
and--

11:09.503 --> 11:13.507
It's okay. We were just--
We're just glad you're safe.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.635
Okay?

11:16.718 --> 11:18.804
-Okay.
-We were just scared.

11:18.887 --> 11:21.598
Yeah, Iz. It's all good. You know, we'll--

11:21.682 --> 11:24.518
We'll talk about this
in the morning, okay?

11:24.601 --> 11:25.602
Okay.

11:29.273 --> 11:32.651
Mom, Dad, do you think
I could move up into the attic?

11:33.652 --> 11:36.280
Please?
I mean, I know you're mad right now,

11:36.363 --> 11:39.199
but, I mean, I'm not a kid anymore,

11:39.283 --> 11:41.493
and I just really
need a little more privacy.

12:02.723 --> 12:04.183
What are you doing?

12:04.725 --> 12:08.270
-Mom and Dad said I could sleep upstairs.
-For tonight?

12:09.354 --> 12:10.772
No. For good.

12:12.482 --> 12:16.069
Look, Hilde, I'm in high school now, okay?
Things are gonna be different.

12:16.653 --> 12:19.364
But I don't want them to be different.

12:20.824 --> 12:25.454
I know that you may think
my reporting is annoying sometimes,

12:25.537 --> 12:28.207
but I wouldn't know
how to do it without you.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.919
Good journalists,
they look at both perspectives

12:32.002 --> 12:34.630
and consider other people's feelings.

12:35.214 --> 12:37.007
I forget to do that sometimes.

12:39.176 --> 12:40.677
But you never do.

12:54.691 --> 12:58.820
Sheriff Johnson, I took it upon myself
to rereview the drone footage.

12:58.904 --> 13:00.405
Of course you did.

13:01.031 --> 13:03.992
I found something
that I think you might've missed.

13:04.785 --> 13:07.829
There was someone else on that island.

13:08.664 --> 13:10.082
Damn it, Frank.

13:10.165 --> 13:13.168
Off duty, without a warrant,
that's criminal trespassing.

13:13.836 --> 13:16.713
From an outsider's perspective,
allow me to say,

13:16.797 --> 13:18.757
he's a liability for your department.

13:18.841 --> 13:20.884
All due respect,
you don't know him like I do.

13:21.468 --> 13:22.553
You're right...

13:24.429 --> 13:26.306
which is why I'm the better judge here.

13:27.015 --> 13:30.727
He has a pattern of unprofessional
and insubordinate behavior.

13:30.811 --> 13:35.524
I was gonna say as much in my report,
but after this, you need to fire him.

13:37.526 --> 13:39.152
Wait a minute.

13:39.236 --> 13:41.321
This job is his life.

13:42.072 --> 13:44.491
I mean, it may not look like it
in this one instance,

13:44.575 --> 13:46.201
but he is a solid officer.

13:46.285 --> 13:48.829
He knows this community
better than anyone.

13:48.912 --> 13:52.708
I mean, we've had our differences,
but we overcame that.

13:52.791 --> 13:54.209
I can't fire him.

13:55.586 --> 14:00.007
Look. I know how you wanna
feel like you're in control here.

14:00.799 --> 14:04.720
And believe it or not,
hey, I want you to succeed.

14:04.803 --> 14:08.724
Just do what you have to do.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.517
Because if you don't,

14:10.601 --> 14:14.062
you and I both know you're gonna look
just as corrupt as your predecessor.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.824
No, I'm telling you.

14:25.908 --> 14:29.745
She finds everything I do.
I cannot hide anything from her, period.

14:29.828 --> 14:32.456
She finds out. If I buy her a present,
she's, like, in it.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.082
No, she digs around.

14:34.166 --> 14:37.211
She's, like, snooping around
in all my stuff all the time.

14:44.718 --> 14:47.804
Yeah. Well, you know, some of us
have some work to do around here.

14:47.888 --> 14:50.849
So, I'll see you guys later.

14:54.645 --> 14:58.106
Whenever I do my notes, I subconsciously
just draw triangles for no reason.

14:58.190 --> 15:00.400
There's this pen that I saw at the store,

15:00.484 --> 15:03.028
-and it can scan the letters...
-That's like future stuff.

15:03.111 --> 15:05.030
...and then scan them back
on a different page.

15:07.991 --> 15:10.202
Listen, I know it was rough yesterday.

15:10.285 --> 15:12.829
It was. Thank you for saying that.

15:13.622 --> 15:17.501
But I think we can still chase the story
without getting in any more trouble.

15:17.584 --> 15:18.794
Are you serious?

15:20.587 --> 15:23.090
-She's serious.
-Of course she's serious.

15:23.173 --> 15:26.802
Look, all we just need to do is
get people to use my water-testing kits,

15:26.885 --> 15:29.096
-and then we can just--
-I'm taking the deal.

15:29.179 --> 15:30.180
What?

15:30.264 --> 15:32.474
I just have to do some community service

15:32.558 --> 15:35.519
and not write anything
about Wott Management,

15:35.602 --> 15:37.479
and that'll be the end of it.

15:39.356 --> 15:42.150
Taking it too.
I'm not built for prison, Hilde.

15:42.234 --> 15:45.445
I'm more of a sensitive, artistic type.

15:47.781 --> 15:50.993
They can't keep us from
writing on the story. It's the truth.

15:51.660 --> 15:53.579
I'm sorry. I'm out.

15:54.413 --> 15:55.414
Me too.

15:56.665 --> 15:58.959
How could you let them do this to us?

16:00.502 --> 16:01.920
We're a team.

16:03.881 --> 16:05.090
Let's get back to work.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.594
What'd you get for number seven?

16:42.169 --> 16:43.504
Smooth move, Lisko.

16:50.093 --> 16:51.094
Hey.

16:53.430 --> 16:54.848
I don't bite, you know?

17:05.483 --> 17:06.484
Hi.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.035
I...

17:17.538 --> 17:20.832
I like you a lot, you know? But...

17:24.377 --> 17:25.420
I just...

17:27.756 --> 17:29.550
I don't know if I like you like that.

17:32.135 --> 17:33.136
But...

17:34.346 --> 17:36.598
you are maybe, like,

17:36.682 --> 17:39.309
one of the coolest girls
I've ever seen in real life.

17:40.018 --> 17:42.479
And I think if you asked me to, like,

17:42.563 --> 17:45.524
cut all my hair off and dye it purple
and get a face tattoo,

17:45.607 --> 17:46.817
I would probably do it.

17:50.070 --> 17:51.071
And...

17:54.157 --> 17:56.785
I just really don't want you to hate me,

17:56.869 --> 18:00.247
or think that I'm, like,
unbelievably lame,

18:00.330 --> 18:02.082
because I feel like I actually--

18:03.083 --> 18:04.835
I like myself around you.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.504
And I never feel like that.

18:08.172 --> 18:10.424
Or, you know, rarely ever.

18:11.842 --> 18:14.136
Sorry. I'm just--

18:15.470 --> 18:18.098
I was so pissed at Ethan
when I thought he was saying

18:18.182 --> 18:21.310
that he wouldn't wanna be friends with me
if we weren't dating.

18:22.603 --> 18:24.521
Then I realized that...

18:26.732 --> 18:28.609
that's what I was afraid of with you.

18:32.404 --> 18:35.782
Izzy, I'm still gonna wanna be your friend
no matter what.

18:37.117 --> 18:40.329
-So you don't hate me?
-No, of course not.

18:41.330 --> 18:42.331
I mean...

18:43.749 --> 18:46.960
I'm disappointed, obviously, a little.

18:48.712 --> 18:51.507
I think you know a version of yourself
you like the best.

18:52.424 --> 18:55.594
And I think you're kind of looking at me
for permission to become her.

19:00.098 --> 19:03.060
Permission granted. Duh.

19:08.607 --> 19:11.818
Take a test kit.
Don't let them pollute our town.

19:11.902 --> 19:15.280
Hi. Take a test kit.
Don't let them pollute our town.

19:15.864 --> 19:17.783
Hi. Take a test kit.

19:17.866 --> 19:23.121
So, I know this is a lot to take in,
but in the mountains, there are barrels,

19:23.205 --> 19:26.416
and they're leaking
all the way down into this lake.

19:27.417 --> 19:31.171
Everything that the water touches dies,
so it must be toxic.

19:32.464 --> 19:36.552
And it's only a matter of time before
that water makes its way down to us.

19:38.220 --> 19:40.806
So if we don't figure out
what they're covering up,

19:41.431 --> 19:44.560
everyone in this town could be at risk.

19:44.643 --> 19:48.063
Take a test kit.
Don't let them pollute our town.

19:54.444 --> 19:58.282
Hilde,
you cannot just set up shop like this.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.659
Does Mr. O'Hara know
you took that from the library?

20:00.742 --> 20:02.578
Principal Collins,
people have the right to know

20:02.661 --> 20:06.331
-if something might be making them sick.
-Hilde, our water is fine.

20:06.415 --> 20:08.000
But you don't understand.

20:08.083 --> 20:10.961
They dragged us into
the sheriff's station, fined us,

20:11.044 --> 20:14.173
and even had Lieutenant Briggs fired
for helping us.

20:14.256 --> 20:15.299
What?

20:15.382 --> 20:18.719
Did Frank not say anything to you?

20:21.805 --> 20:23.640
Next time, you need to get my permission

20:23.724 --> 20:26.310
before you commandeer
the school halls like this.

20:27.311 --> 20:28.312
I--

20:29.479 --> 20:32.858
You need to think about the consequences
before you take actions.

20:37.154 --> 20:38.155
Thank you.

20:39.823 --> 20:41.491
Take that back to the library.

21:06.725 --> 21:07.726
Hi, Mr. Johnson.

21:07.809 --> 21:09.228
How can I help you?

21:13.482 --> 21:15.901
I'm sorry for what I said.

21:16.777 --> 21:18.779
Thank you. I appreciate that.

21:20.447 --> 21:23.575
I've been trying to get people in town
to test their water

21:23.659 --> 21:25.744
-to see if it's toxic and--
-Uh-uh.

21:25.827 --> 21:30.582
Hilde, please don't spread panic
through the community like that. Gosh!

21:30.666 --> 21:32.751
But, Trip, I know what I saw.

21:32.835 --> 21:36.046
They're dumping something out there,
but I just don't know what.

21:36.129 --> 21:39.466
It's private property. For all we know,
they could be doing construction.

21:39.550 --> 21:42.469
I can't throw around accusations
without some proof.

21:42.553 --> 21:46.306
Now, I took your tip about the Woodruff
basement, remember? You remember that?

21:46.390 --> 21:50.602
And it ended up being nothing
except an embarrassment for me.

21:52.354 --> 21:53.981
So let's get proof.

21:54.064 --> 21:57.860
This is for your dad. He lives
closer to the island than anyone.

21:57.943 --> 22:00.237
If there is something in that water,

22:00.320 --> 22:02.739
-it'll reach him first.
-Hilde.

22:04.449 --> 22:06.994
My dad's already got
so much to worry about.

22:07.077 --> 22:09.288
Now, I don't wanna stress him out
about something

22:09.371 --> 22:10.873
that might not even be happening.

22:10.956 --> 22:13.792
Look,
I know you can't be my source anymore.

22:13.876 --> 22:18.797
And I guess it's a conflict of interest
for you to be my friend.

22:18.881 --> 22:23.719
But I am always gonna care about the truth
and doing the right thing.

22:25.220 --> 22:26.221
And you.

22:29.099 --> 22:31.810
I don't want you or your dad to get hurt.

23:16.897 --> 23:18.941
-Hi.
-Hey.

23:22.611 --> 23:24.071
Are you all right?

23:24.154 --> 23:25.155
Not really.

23:29.868 --> 23:31.662
So, is this what we're doing now?

23:32.162 --> 23:34.164
Keeping secrets from each other?

23:35.332 --> 23:37.084
Why didn't you just tell me?

23:40.587 --> 23:43.590
I had to find out
from Hilde of all people.

23:44.967 --> 23:47.594
Do you know how hard it is
to keep a poker face

23:47.678 --> 23:50.305
in front of the world's youngest
CIA operative?

23:53.100 --> 23:56.436
'Cause I knew once I told you,
it'd be real, and I wasn't ready for that.

23:56.937 --> 23:59.106
Like, look, I screwed up.

24:03.861 --> 24:04.945
I'm sorry.

24:05.779 --> 24:07.364
You're sorry? Why?

24:07.447 --> 24:09.700
Because you deserve better than this.

24:09.783 --> 24:12.369
You should be with somebody
you can rely on,

24:12.452 --> 24:14.162
somebody you could be proud of,

24:14.246 --> 24:16.915
not some guy who got fired
from the first job he ever had.

24:16.999 --> 24:19.293
Yeah, well, you're not some guy.

24:21.003 --> 24:23.839
-You're my fiancé.
-Which makes it even worse.

24:26.925 --> 24:30.262
You know, long before that,
you were Cranky Frankie.

24:31.805 --> 24:34.558
The world's saddest first grader,

24:34.641 --> 24:38.687
who would cry every time
his mom dropped him off at school.

24:39.688 --> 24:41.106
Is this supposed to be helping?

24:42.774 --> 24:45.402
We've been friends for over 30 years.

24:45.485 --> 24:47.446
I've known every version of you,

24:48.322 --> 24:50.240
and I've loved them all...

24:51.325 --> 24:53.410
even Cranky Frankie.

24:59.041 --> 25:03.795
You can get fired from a dozen more jobs.
I will never be ashamed of you.

25:24.399 --> 25:25.526
Are you okay?

25:26.944 --> 25:28.070
I'm fine.

25:31.240 --> 25:34.576
It's just-- How can people
not wanna know the truth?

25:34.660 --> 25:39.998
I mean, we uncovered this huge story,
and they don't even wanna hear it.

25:40.082 --> 25:43.210
It's like they don't even wanna know
if something bad is happening.

25:43.961 --> 25:46.463
Yeah. Well, you know,
I think that you're right.

25:46.547 --> 25:48.173
You know, bad news, it...

25:49.550 --> 25:51.760
well, it makes
people feel helpless, right?

25:52.344 --> 25:56.557
So, they don't feel like
they can change anything.

25:57.057 --> 25:58.600
So they just don't wanna know.

25:59.726 --> 26:03.188
Is that why you didn't wanna help me
figure out why Pop-Pop was sick?

26:13.073 --> 26:15.534
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

26:16.577 --> 26:18.203
You know, I think you're right.

26:18.287 --> 26:22.791
I think that I was afraid
that whatever the answer was,

26:22.875 --> 26:25.043
I wasn't gonna be able to help him.

26:27.671 --> 26:30.382
Yeah, I was.
I was scared to even go there,

26:31.216 --> 26:34.011
to even ask the question, but not you.

26:35.345 --> 26:38.473
I wish we could just ask Pop-Pop about it.

26:38.974 --> 26:39.975
Yeah.

26:40.058 --> 26:42.269
You know, like go back in time with him.

26:42.352 --> 26:46.982
I feel like he knows the answer.
He just can't tell us.

26:48.650 --> 26:50.903
Yeah, but I know it's a stupid idea.

26:52.988 --> 26:56.742
No. No, no, no, no.
That's not a stupid idea at all.

26:56.825 --> 26:59.828
-Wait. Dad, what is it?
-Hilde, look what I made!

27:01.038 --> 27:05.334
It's a picture book about my adventure
with Pop-Pop when we went around town.

27:10.839 --> 27:12.841
It's nice. You did a good job.

27:27.981 --> 27:28.982
What is it?

27:29.483 --> 27:34.112
Yeah, I'm looking for this story
I wrote years ago back in New York.

27:34.196 --> 27:37.866
You know, Pop-Pop wasn't sick then,
so I never made the connection. But--

27:37.950 --> 27:42.663
Yeah, it's about this treatment
called reminiscence therapy.

27:43.163 --> 27:46.583
Yeah, it's to help people with dementia
remember the past.

27:47.459 --> 27:48.460
Here we go.

27:51.672 --> 27:53.173
Yeah, look, check it out.

27:55.926 --> 27:58.011
There was this nursing home in San Diego

27:58.095 --> 28:01.557
that built an entire 1950s town
for their patients, right?

28:01.640 --> 28:06.019
By helping recreate their pasts,
they're able to dig into their memories.

28:06.103 --> 28:09.648
You know, I'm thinking we should
do something like that for Pop-Pop.

28:09.731 --> 28:13.485
-What memory should we try?
-I don't know. What do you think?

28:13.569 --> 28:16.613
Yeah, he's been to the bike shop
a bunch of times.

28:16.697 --> 28:20.409
He's definitely too used to this place.
What do you think?

28:21.618 --> 28:23.537
Ginny. Ginny!

28:24.371 --> 28:26.540
Ginny, bring that book down here!

28:26.623 --> 28:30.210
Ginny made a book about her and Pop-Pop
when they went out the other day.

28:30.294 --> 28:31.962
May I see that book again?

28:35.591 --> 28:39.720
No. No. You guys went to the beach?

28:40.470 --> 28:41.555
What's this?

28:42.055 --> 28:44.600
It's a restaurant.
Pop-Pop used to go there.

28:45.517 --> 28:48.353
Here, let me see that. Wait, is that...

28:50.355 --> 28:51.565
is that Scoglio's?

28:52.733 --> 28:57.362
Yeah, it is. That's Scoglio's.
That's the red gingham tablecloth.

28:57.446 --> 29:01.158
You know, Pop-Pop used to take me here
all the time when I was a kid. Wow.

29:02.326 --> 29:04.995
Do you think it would help Pop-Pop
if we recreated it?

29:06.580 --> 29:10.292
I don't know, honey, but--
Yeah, it's worth a shot.

29:10.375 --> 29:13.712
I'm gonna go tell Mom and Izzy.
Great job, Ginny.

29:14.630 --> 29:15.631
Yeah, you know...

29:17.716 --> 29:20.093
good job, sweetie, really.

29:21.011 --> 29:22.137
Good job.

29:29.061 --> 29:30.604
Okay. Get up there.

29:32.189 --> 29:36.693
According to Dad's article,
we need to let him take the lead,

29:36.777 --> 29:38.278
see where the conversation goes.

29:38.779 --> 29:42.616
Yeah, that's right.
There's no need to push too far. Okay.

29:42.699 --> 29:45.327
Okay, bath time for you,
my little principessa.

29:45.410 --> 29:46.662
All right, what else?

29:46.745 --> 29:48.247
-I know.
-You get the pasta.

29:48.330 --> 29:50.123
-I got it.
-Did someone check the pasta?

29:50.207 --> 29:52.417
No. You didn't check-- Oh, my gosh.

29:56.421 --> 29:57.548
What are you doing here?

29:59.925 --> 30:03.512
Someone may or may not have mentioned
you might need a piano player.

30:07.724 --> 30:11.436
-That someone would have been Hilde.
-Yeah, kinda got that.

30:23.031 --> 30:26.743
Look, I'm really sorry for being
such a tool earlier. I just--

30:26.827 --> 30:28.245
I got jealous.

30:28.328 --> 30:32.457
Yeah, well, still, I mean, you shouldn't
try to control who I'm friends with.

30:32.541 --> 30:34.293
I know. I didn't mean to do that.

30:34.376 --> 30:37.087
I guess I just felt,
I don't know, threatened.

30:37.171 --> 30:39.464
But I should not have tried
to make you choose.

30:41.800 --> 30:47.055
'Kay, well, lucky for you,
Emma was super cool about the whole thing.

30:47.139 --> 30:48.140
So...

30:48.932 --> 30:50.684
guess you can still be my boyfriend.

30:51.894 --> 30:54.354
I mean, sure you still want me, or...?

30:55.355 --> 30:58.609
-Did you really rent that out?
-What? Come on, no.

30:59.193 --> 31:00.903
Well, I-- Actually, yeah. I--

31:01.403 --> 31:04.865
I thought it would sell the whole
"Billy Joel, Italian restaurant" thing,

31:04.948 --> 31:09.119
but I guess I just look like my Uncle Sal
trying way too hard on Easter Sunday.

31:11.038 --> 31:13.999
Wow. Like I walked into a different era.

31:14.082 --> 31:17.044
Yeah, that's what we were going for.

31:17.836 --> 31:19.004
Right.

31:21.757 --> 31:24.468
So, were there any songs
your grandpa liked back then?

31:25.761 --> 31:26.762
I don't know.

31:29.515 --> 31:30.516
All right.

31:34.561 --> 31:39.066
Here he is! Welcome to Scoglio's,
the very best Italian in town.

31:39.149 --> 31:41.568
-Oh, my.
-Why don't you come sit down?

31:43.445 --> 31:45.656
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Yeah, no, no, look.

31:45.739 --> 31:48.909
Let me get a spoon for that.
Let me get you a spoon.

31:52.746 --> 31:55.749
-Signore.
-Oh, my goodness.

31:55.832 --> 31:57.543
-Wow.
-My favorite.

31:57.626 --> 31:58.752
Wow, wow, wow.

32:00.504 --> 32:01.505
Bread or butter?

32:02.130 --> 32:03.131
No, thank you.

32:07.928 --> 32:10.973
How come you never took us here,
Pop-Pop? I love it.

32:14.184 --> 32:16.979
Wow, look at this place.

32:17.062 --> 32:19.314
Sorry, I'm late. It's beautiful.

32:25.153 --> 32:27.573
Did you come here a lot with Jane,
Sylvester?

32:33.662 --> 32:36.623
You know, Jane, your wife.

32:55.434 --> 32:58.896
My Jane, at first, she hated this place.

33:00.063 --> 33:02.858
She said it reminded her
of the social clubs

33:02.941 --> 33:04.651
on the West Side of Chicago.

33:05.527 --> 33:07.112
But I'd still drag her here...

33:08.155 --> 33:11.283
because it was the best veal chop
in Erie Harbor.

33:16.872 --> 33:20.584
She always looked so beautiful
in this candlelight.

33:24.922 --> 33:28.634
I don't understand.
Why are all the guys so late?

33:29.801 --> 33:31.261
Today of all days.

33:33.764 --> 33:35.349
Are they just not gonna show up?

33:36.642 --> 33:39.061
Why? What's today, Pop?

33:39.144 --> 33:42.105
Our goodbye party from Strata.

33:42.189 --> 33:44.650
The Plant Five boys are movin' on up.

33:46.026 --> 33:49.196
-So, you're leaving the factory, Syl?
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.

33:49.279 --> 33:51.990
-They gave me a fat severance check.
-Really?

33:52.074 --> 33:55.994
Everybody at the plant's getting one
'cause they're shutting our division down.

34:03.669 --> 34:06.046
Are these the Plant Five boys, Pop-Pop?

34:13.262 --> 34:15.806
Yeah, plus Junior.

34:17.391 --> 34:21.895
He didn't work at Strata,
but he knew all the best places to fish.

34:21.978 --> 34:22.980
Oh, really?

34:23.563 --> 34:27.818
And did Strata give money to all of you?

34:27.900 --> 34:32.489
Yeah. They decided to be generous
since they're putting us all out of work.

34:34.408 --> 34:35.951
It's probably for the best.

34:36.034 --> 34:39.246
I hated that spray.
Made me cough like crazy.

34:40.414 --> 34:42.248
Wait. What spray, Dad?

34:42.833 --> 34:45.668
Some sealant. We sprayed it on the planes.

34:49.380 --> 34:52.259
-And it made you sick?
-No.

34:53.427 --> 34:56.179
A Strata doctor checked us out.

34:56.679 --> 34:59.808
He said my headaches
must've been allergies

34:59.892 --> 35:02.227
to all the dust in the plant.

35:03.437 --> 35:05.272
And you believed him?

35:15.073 --> 35:16.909
It doesn't matter anymore.

35:23.790 --> 35:26.168
I'm gonna take my severance money,

35:26.251 --> 35:28.712
and I'm gonna open a bicycle shop.

35:28.795 --> 35:30.005
"Syl's Cycles."

35:35.928 --> 35:37.596
What do you think, Matty?

35:39.890 --> 35:42.684
I think it's great, Pop.

35:45.145 --> 35:46.939
I wanna make sure you love it.

35:47.606 --> 35:49.733
The shop's for you, Matty.

35:49.816 --> 35:52.277
This is all gonna be yours one day,
you know.

35:53.612 --> 35:55.656
Yeah, well, I love it, Pop.

35:57.533 --> 36:00.285
Really, I love it.

36:00.369 --> 36:04.164
-You love it?
-Yeah, really. I really love it.

36:11.964 --> 36:16.093
So, if what Pop-Pop was saying was right,
then it sounds like Strata knew

36:16.176 --> 36:19.137
that the sealant they were using
in Plant Five was dangerous.

36:19.221 --> 36:21.056
That's gonna be hard to prove in court.

36:21.139 --> 36:22.391
-Yeah.
-Why?

36:22.474 --> 36:26.144
Well, because you're trying
to build an argument around intent

36:26.228 --> 36:28.438
for something that happened
nearly 50 years ago.

36:28.522 --> 36:31.859
Yeah, right. Yeah, just 'cause Strata
gave out big severance checks,

36:31.942 --> 36:34.778
that doesn't prove that they did it
'cause of health issues at the plant.

36:34.862 --> 36:36.655
But why else would they do it?

36:36.738 --> 36:38.365
Well, my hunch?

36:39.533 --> 36:42.369
They wanted to make
the Plant Five workers feel grateful.

36:42.452 --> 36:45.914
Because if they're grateful,
then they wouldn't ask questions.

36:45.998 --> 36:46.999
Right.

36:47.958 --> 36:49.877
There's something wrong with Walter.

37:17.404 --> 37:22.367
Love of mine
Someday you will die

37:23.410 --> 37:25.579
But I'll be close behind

37:26.997 --> 37:29.541
And I'll follow you into the dark

37:29.625 --> 37:31.168
Thank you all for being here.

37:31.251 --> 37:33.462
No blinding light

37:33.545 --> 37:36.590
Or tunnels to gates of white

37:37.174 --> 37:40.093
Just our hands clasped so tight

37:40.636 --> 37:44.389
Waiting for the hint of a spark

37:45.098 --> 37:47.476
If Heaven and Hell decide

37:48.268 --> 37:50.896
That they both are satisfied

37:53.023 --> 37:58.028
When I first met you, I promised you
everything was gonna be okay.

38:00.280 --> 38:01.823
I tried really hard.

38:03.116 --> 38:05.494
I did everything
I thought I was supposed to,

38:05.577 --> 38:08.747
but it just wasn't enough.

38:08.830 --> 38:10.290
Into the dark

38:16.797 --> 38:18.257
If Heaven and Hell decide

38:18.340 --> 38:19.341
I'm sorry.

38:20.300 --> 38:23.220
That they both are satisfied

38:23.720 --> 38:24.721
Goodbye.

38:24.805 --> 38:26.640
And illuminate the noes

38:27.349 --> 38:29.977
On their vacancy signs

38:30.060 --> 38:31.311
Goodbye, Walter.

38:31.395 --> 38:36.191
If there's no one beside you
As your soul disembarks

38:36.275 --> 38:37.276
You okay?

38:37.985 --> 38:40.904
Then I'll follow you into the dark

38:40.988 --> 38:42.739
I'm fine. It's just a bird.

38:45.242 --> 38:51.081
Then I'll follow you into the dark

39:01.466 --> 39:02.551
Hey, Scout.

39:03.510 --> 39:06.513
-Yeah, what's all this?
-Research.

39:07.681 --> 39:10.601
I need to figure out
what was in that sealant,

39:10.684 --> 39:13.896
what Pop-Pop might've been exposed to
at Strata.

39:15.355 --> 39:18.525
Yeah, sweetie, why don't you
let me tag in for a little bit?

39:19.401 --> 39:21.236
You know, I know it's important, but...

39:22.196 --> 39:28.076
Yeah, I think your little sister
needs her big sister right now.

39:30.162 --> 39:31.163
Yeah?

40:13.372 --> 40:15.249
Do you think Walter's in Heaven?

40:18.710 --> 40:19.837
I don't know, Ginny.

40:21.129 --> 40:24.716
Sometimes I worry that
it's something grown-ups made up

40:24.800 --> 40:26.426
so we don't feel so scared.

40:32.266 --> 40:36.103
Actually, I do think Walter's in Heaven.

40:37.771 --> 40:42.067
I think he's up there chirping away
with his little bird family,

40:42.150 --> 40:45.445
eating some little bird ice cream
on a little bird beach.

40:46.071 --> 40:48.073
So, yeah.

40:49.491 --> 40:51.660
I do think Walter's in Heaven.

40:55.330 --> 40:56.957
I owe you an apology.

40:57.916 --> 40:58.959
For what?

41:00.252 --> 41:04.631
When you were trying to tell me something,
and I kept ignoring you.

41:04.715 --> 41:07.634
I thought what I was doing
was more important,

41:08.343 --> 41:09.469
like I knew better.

41:11.054 --> 41:13.473
People do that to me all the time.

41:15.058 --> 41:16.560
And I hate it.

41:17.352 --> 41:19.938
I promise
I will never do that to you again.

41:37.539 --> 41:38.540
What is it?

41:40.792 --> 41:44.421
The water sample results came back.

41:45.422 --> 41:48.675
Well, there's cadmium in those barrels.

41:51.136 --> 41:55.933
Yeah, cadmium is-- it's a heavy metal.
You know, I looked into it and...

41:57.142 --> 41:58.185
it's linked...

41:58.810 --> 42:00.020
to dementia.

42:03.232 --> 42:05.567
Now we know why he goes in and out.

42:05.651 --> 42:07.611
It's not just memory loss.

42:09.613 --> 42:12.533
Hilde? Hilde?

42:13.534 --> 42:14.952
What is it?

42:22.251 --> 42:23.252
Dad, look.

42:23.752 --> 42:27.005
Cadmium is one of the chemicals
Strata used.

42:28.173 --> 42:32.261
They said they stopped in the early '70s
and disposed of it safely,

42:32.344 --> 42:34.555
but what if they lied?

42:35.556 --> 42:38.058
Wait, but that would mean
that they're the ones responsible

42:38.141 --> 42:39.560
for those barrels on the island.

42:40.394 --> 42:42.187
I mean, if that is true,

42:42.813 --> 42:46.692
then they've been covering this up
for years, decades even.

42:46.775 --> 42:49.111
Strata was behind it all along.

43:17.181 --> 43:21.226
For decades, Erie Harbor
has been known as a safe haven,

43:21.310 --> 43:25.772
a small town surrounded by nature,
fresh air and clean water,

43:26.398 --> 43:29.484
the kind of place where people
would want to raise their families.

43:31.153 --> 43:34.948
But The Chronicle has uncovered
a problem with the town's water supply.

43:36.283 --> 43:39.953
At least one Erie Harbor home
has tested positive for heavy metals

43:40.037 --> 43:43.207
and many more could soon be at risk.

43:46.001 --> 43:49.463
We don't know yet
who's responsible for the toxic water,

43:49.546 --> 43:53.217
but connections have been drawn
to the largest company in town,

43:53.300 --> 43:55.135
Strata Tech Industries.

44:15.405 --> 44:18.075
So now, Erie Harbor citizens must ask...

44:19.743 --> 44:21.370
"What else are they hiding?"

44:21.870 --> 44:25.374
Sweetie, if cadmium was the reason
that Pop-Pop got sick,

44:25.457 --> 44:27.793
I don't think we can reverse that.

44:32.881 --> 44:34.633
Then I want them to pay.
