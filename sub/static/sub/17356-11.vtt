00:07.541 --> 00:08.607
- ¶

00:08.609 --> 00:12.144
- Allison's coming back?
Finally.

00:12.146 --> 00:14.713
Who's Allison?

00:15.583 --> 00:17.116
- What...? Um...

00:17.118 --> 00:17.783
Max's girlfriend?

00:17.785 --> 00:19.385
The one who's been
away volunteering

00:19.387 --> 00:21.153
with the Earth Corps
for three months?

00:21.155 --> 00:22.588
- How could you
forget her name?

00:22.590 --> 00:25.758
- 'Cause I didn't write
it on my wrist...

00:27.094 --> 00:28.827
Dad.

00:30.297 --> 00:32.097
- Well, I hope
she gets here soon

00:32.099 --> 00:34.266
because Max's attitude
is unbearable.

00:34.268 --> 00:36.335
- ¶ Allison! ¶

00:36.337 --> 00:40.639
¶ You're comin'
back real soon! ¶

00:40.641 --> 00:43.776
- I think I know
why she left.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.348
- I know and now it's
rubbin' off on your mom.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.315
- ¶ Allison! ¶

00:50.317 --> 00:53.185
¶ Max's girlfriend is in! ¶

00:53.187 --> 00:56.522
- Wow. It's like
a musical--

00:56.524 --> 00:59.825
without any good
songs or talent.

01:00.261 --> 01:04.463
- Come, family,
see the feast I prepared.

01:04.465 --> 01:06.565
I made all of Allison's
favorites--

01:06.567 --> 01:11.603
kale tacos, cabbage dogs
and broccoli burgers.

01:12.540 --> 01:15.774
- Well, no wonder
she's so angry.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.143
- All right,
don't worry, guys.

01:18.145 --> 01:23.515
This is why I installed
the emergency meat button.

01:23.517 --> 01:25.551
- [ham plunks]

01:25.553 --> 01:27.653
- [kisses ham]

01:27.655 --> 01:30.355
- That's why our house
smells like a deli.

01:30.357 --> 01:33.225
- [cell phone bings]
- Oh! It's Allison.

01:33.227 --> 01:34.526
[giggles]

01:34.528 --> 01:38.464
- Ooh, Max's girlfriend
loves him.

01:40.835 --> 01:42.801
- "Max, I'm--

01:42.803 --> 01:45.437
breaking up with you"?

01:45.439 --> 01:48.707
- Wow. I was way off.

01:49.643 --> 01:52.711
- "I realized you're
not my soulmate,

01:52.713 --> 01:54.346
the Earth is."

01:55.249 --> 01:56.148
Stupid Earth!

01:56.150 --> 01:58.784
I shoulda destroyed it
when I had the chance!

02:00.287 --> 02:02.888
- Yeah, Earth
is the worst.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.492
I don't know. I'm trying
to be supportive.

02:07.328 --> 02:08.327
- You don't need her, Max.

02:08.329 --> 02:10.162
There's other fish
in the sea.

02:10.164 --> 02:12.798
- And under our seats.

02:14.468 --> 02:17.336
- Are you okay, honey?
- Yeah.

02:17.338 --> 02:19.271
Yeah...I'm fine.

02:21.842 --> 02:24.776
I'll never love again!!

02:25.613 --> 02:26.745
- He's not serious.

02:26.747 --> 02:29.348
- MAX:
I'm super serious!!

02:33.621 --> 02:35.621
- Oh, no, the kids
have been attacked

02:35.623 --> 02:37.656
by Professor Fancy Pants.

02:39.560 --> 02:42.194
- Well, I wish
he'd attacked sooner.

02:42.196 --> 02:44.229
They look amazing!

02:44.632 --> 02:46.265
- We're just a couple
of mature individuals

02:46.267 --> 02:49.801
who want to have an adult
conversation with their parents.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.837
- That's right, so,
sit back, relax,

02:51.839 --> 02:53.705
and have a cup of coffee.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.307
- BARB:
Ohhh...

02:55.309 --> 02:56.975
we'd love some.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.711
No.
- Ugh.

03:01.315 --> 03:02.948
That tastes
like dirt water.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.751
- It's that what
coffee is?

03:07.254 --> 03:08.587
- We believe we're
ready to begin

03:08.589 --> 03:10.656
a more grown-up level
of superhero training.

03:10.658 --> 03:13.659
You started training Phoebe
when she was our age.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.260
- Ah, Phoebe's special--

03:15.262 --> 03:17.663
just like you guys.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.599
- We've taken down
some serious villains--

03:20.601 --> 03:22.534
like Fairy Pinch-ess
at the prom.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.771
- Allow us to refresh
your memories.

03:25.773 --> 03:28.774
- [Velcro ripping]

03:31.445 --> 03:34.680
- I'm gonna pinch
you into next week.

03:35.683 --> 03:39.284
- But she didn't,
because Billy zapped her...

03:39.286 --> 03:40.719
and I locked
her in a box.

03:40.721 --> 03:45.857
- You have zapted me.
Goodbye, cruel world.

03:45.859 --> 03:48.293
- Get in the box,
Scarlett Johansson.

03:48.295 --> 03:49.695
- [whooshing]

03:49.697 --> 03:51.630
[whooshing]

03:51.632 --> 03:55.434
- Another villain taken
out by Billy and...

03:55.436 --> 03:57.269
Nora!

03:58.005 --> 04:00.339
- Okay, you guys
convinced us.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.507
- Meet us in the driveway
tomorrow afternoon,

04:02.509 --> 04:06.678
and we will begin your next
phase of superhero training.

04:06.680 --> 04:07.913
- Nora, we did it!

04:07.915 --> 04:11.850
- I told you it would work.
- BARB: [laughs]

04:12.353 --> 04:14.720
- CHLOE: Guys,
can I come out now?

04:15.556 --> 04:16.888
Hello?

04:18.459 --> 04:21.026
- All right, Max,
the break-up was a few days ago.

04:21.028 --> 04:23.862
Bet you're itching to
get back out on patrol.

04:23.864 --> 04:26.665
- [exaggerated groaning]

04:28.335 --> 04:31.837
- Or itching 'cause
you're a filthy dirt monster.

04:32.373 --> 04:33.739
- Why would I go
out on patrol?

04:33.741 --> 04:38.310
Just arrest Allison
for breaking and entering--

04:38.312 --> 04:40.479
[whines]
my heart!

04:40.914 --> 04:42.748
- Come on, Max, you've
gotta get over this now.

04:42.750 --> 04:46.051
I know your heart is broken,
but the shower is not.

04:47.488 --> 04:50.455
- We will shower
when we're good and ready.

04:50.457 --> 04:51.990
- I'm sorry. "We"?

04:51.992 --> 04:53.358
- You heard him, girlie.

04:53.360 --> 04:56.662
When my Maxie stinks,
I stink.

04:57.031 --> 04:58.330
- Quiet. Humans talking.

04:58.332 --> 04:59.865
Max, come on.
Get up and let's go.

04:59.867 --> 05:02.901
[powers whooshing]
- MAX: [groaning]

05:03.103 --> 05:05.604
- That's it.
I'm puttin' you on ice.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.739
[blows frosty air]

05:08.342 --> 05:09.908
[blows frosty air]

05:09.910 --> 05:11.943
- What happened to
your freeze breath?

05:11.945 --> 05:13.779
That was no freeze
and all breath--

05:13.781 --> 05:16.515
terrible,
horrible breath.

05:16.517 --> 05:18.884
- That's all I got.

05:18.886 --> 05:20.719
Allison really broke me.

05:20.721 --> 05:23.055
Now I'm just
an extremely handsome

05:23.057 --> 05:25.757
shell of my former self.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.460
- When my Maxie
is handsome, I'm hand--

05:28.462 --> 05:31.863
- Zip it, Stinky.
- [step shatters]

05:32.032 --> 05:36.501
- These stairs always worked
when I was with Allison!

05:37.571 --> 05:39.438
- I've never seen
him like this before.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.406
I've gotta get him
to snap out of

05:41.408 --> 05:42.808
this funk and be
super again.

05:42.810 --> 05:43.709
- COLOSSO:
Impossible.

05:43.711 --> 05:46.978
He only wants Allison back
and that's not gonna happen.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.715
- But I could find
him a new "Allison."

05:49.717 --> 05:52.884
- [girly voice]
Well, look no further.

05:56.390 --> 05:59.057
- This is disturbing
in so many ways.

05:59.927 --> 06:03.662
- [girly voice] Don't hate
me because I'm beautiful!

06:05.432 --> 06:07.532
- ¶

06:07.534 --> 06:08.567
¶ What you see ¶

06:08.569 --> 06:09.868

06:09.870 --> 06:13.438

06:13.440 --> 06:14.973

06:14.975 --> 06:16.441
¶ Bet you never guess ¶

06:16.443 --> 06:17.943
¶ 'Cause we're
livin' our life ¶

06:17.945 --> 06:19.611
¶ Just like all the rest ¶

06:19.613 --> 06:21.546
¶ A picture
perfect family ¶

06:21.548 --> 06:23.448
¶ Is what we try to be ¶

06:23.450 --> 06:24.850
¶ Look closer,
you might see ¶

06:24.852 --> 06:26.451
¶ The crazy things we do ¶

06:26.453 --> 06:28.153
¶ This isn't
make believe ¶

06:28.155 --> 06:29.788
¶ It's our reality ¶

06:29.790 --> 06:30.889
¶ Just your average family ¶

06:30.891 --> 06:34.526
¶ Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble ¶

06:34.528 --> 06:38.797
¶ Livin' a double life ¶¶

06:41.802 --> 06:44.069
- ¶

06:44.071 --> 06:48.306
- [metal detector
whirring, beeping]

06:48.308 --> 06:49.574
- Cherry?

06:49.576 --> 06:50.609
Um, what're you doin'?

06:50.611 --> 06:52.778
How is this gonna help us
find Max a new girlfriend?

06:52.780 --> 06:57.048
- [laughing] Oh, I thought
you said "new gold pen."

06:57.050 --> 06:59.718
- [metal detector whirring]

07:00.154 --> 07:01.286
- Okay. Um...
[laughs]

07:01.288 --> 07:02.721
I figure the best
way to help Max

07:02.723 --> 07:05.023
get over Allison is
to find him a new girl

07:05.025 --> 07:06.291
that's exactly
like Allison.

07:06.293 --> 07:07.826
- Yeah, that makes
total sense.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.995
Any girl would be
lucky to date Max.

07:09.997 --> 07:13.331
- Everything is pain!

07:15.035 --> 07:18.370
Your relationship
is doomed!

07:19.873 --> 07:23.074
- Yeah, I was wrong.
He'll never date again.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.710
- I guess it was
a crazy idea, anyway.

07:25.712 --> 07:27.045
I mean, it's not
like the universe

07:27.047 --> 07:28.947
is just gonna send us
a new Allison.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.349
- This is new Allison.

07:31.351 --> 07:33.051
- Actually,
my name is Molly.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.086
- Actually, I don't care.

07:35.088 --> 07:39.391
She's the new head of Green
Teens and your problem now.

07:39.726 --> 07:42.194
Out of my way,
delinquents!

07:42.663 --> 07:43.962
- So, guys,
my first big event

07:43.964 --> 07:45.931
is a pet adoption fair
this afternoon.

07:45.933 --> 07:48.200
Will you help me
spread the word?

07:48.202 --> 07:48.834
- Sure.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.069
There's a pet adoption
fair this afternoon!!

07:51.071 --> 07:53.338
- Um, I think
she meant the flyers.

07:53.340 --> 07:56.875
- Oh. And there's
also flyers!!

07:56.877 --> 08:00.378
- I love your enthusiasm.
Thanks, guys.

08:00.848 --> 08:05.917
- Phoebe, this is amazing.
She's just like Allison.

08:05.919 --> 08:06.418
- Yeah.

08:06.420 --> 08:09.087
I don't know. She's missing that
little bit of crazy Max likes.

08:09.089 --> 08:13.391
- MOLLY: Hey!
Recycle, butt face!

08:14.294 --> 08:18.096
- I'm wrong. She's perfect.
Molly, wait up!

08:19.967 --> 08:24.870
- ¶

08:24.872 --> 08:25.437
- Hey, kids.

08:25.439 --> 08:27.706
Ready to take your training
to the next level?

08:27.708 --> 08:28.840
- BILLY & NORA:
Yeah!

08:28.842 --> 08:31.243
- Meet the Crime Buddy.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.845
- Hello, little supes.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.314
Let's have some
training fun.

08:36.316 --> 08:38.984
- [music playing]

08:38.986 --> 08:41.987
- Oh, this is the perfect
training tool--

08:41.989 --> 08:42.921
for a baby.

08:42.923 --> 08:45.924
- Or someone
who's just been born.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.326
- The training bot
is built to challenge

08:48.328 --> 08:49.461
supes at any level.

08:49.463 --> 08:51.696
Right now, it's set
to cutesy-wootsy

08:51.698 --> 08:55.000
because you two
are cutesy-wootsy.

08:55.269 --> 08:57.168
- We're not
cutesy-wootsy.

08:57.170 --> 09:00.405
- I don't know.
I'm pretty adorable.

09:02.276 --> 09:03.141
- At least challenge us

09:03.143 --> 09:05.010
and crank this thing
up to meanie-weanie.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.945
- No, no, no. I know
this probably feels like

09:06.947 --> 09:08.280
we're taking things
a little slow.

09:08.282 --> 09:10.282
- But if you want
to fight for justice,

09:10.284 --> 09:12.984
you're gonna have
to trust us. Oh!

09:12.986 --> 09:15.020
- Honey, did you
just make that up?

09:15.022 --> 09:15.887
- Yeah, I just did!

09:15.889 --> 09:17.389
Okay, uh, you two
do your best,

09:17.391 --> 09:20.292
and we'll be back to
check on you later.

09:21.161 --> 09:24.429
- Use your powers
to pop as many bubbles

09:24.431 --> 09:26.998
as you can, heroes.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.167
- Billy, this is
so beneath us.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.503
- This is the greatest
day of my life!

09:31.505 --> 09:34.806
- [bubbles popping]

09:37.344 --> 09:39.244
- [groans]
Colosso!

09:39.246 --> 09:41.913
We're outta pizza.
Order more.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.782
- [groans]
Later.

09:43.784 --> 09:47.786
My belly's full and telling
me I need a power nap.

09:49.323 --> 09:51.056
- Good idea, pal.

09:51.058 --> 09:54.459
Allison can't hurt
us in our sleep.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.796
- Come on in.
This is my brother, Max.

09:57.798 --> 10:02.200
Max, this is Molly.
Say hello.

10:02.202 --> 10:05.403
- [exaggerating groaning]

10:06.173 --> 10:06.905
- Oh, my goodness.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.773
I've never seen an animal
in worse condition.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.241
- Okay, look, I know
he seems gross now,

10:10.243 --> 10:14.946
but I promise you under,
all that funk there is a hunk.

10:15.148 --> 10:18.083
- I'm not talking
about that animal.

10:18.085 --> 10:19.484
This animal.

10:19.486 --> 10:23.054
Pepperoni pizza is not
a healthy diet for a bunny.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.322
He looks sick.
- Colosso?

10:24.324 --> 10:26.558
He's not sick. His heart
is just slowin' down

10:26.560 --> 10:28.827
so he can digest
the cheese.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.797
Phoebe, get the pizza
police outta here!

10:32.799 --> 10:35.200
- Uh, Max, can I talk
to you in the kitchen

10:35.202 --> 10:36.368
for a second, please?

10:36.370 --> 10:39.004
Uh, Molly,
make yourself at home.

10:39.006 --> 10:41.239
Have some floor pizza.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.843
Okay, Max, you miss
Allison. I get it.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.511
But I got you
a new Allison.

10:46.513 --> 10:47.579
Don't blow it.

10:47.581 --> 10:48.880
- What's the point?

10:48.882 --> 10:50.015
It's only a matter of time

10:50.017 --> 10:52.384
before she leaves
me for the Earth.

10:52.386 --> 10:54.819
Stupid Earth!

10:54.821 --> 10:58.423
I refuse to breathe your air!
[holding breath]

11:10.570 --> 11:13.338
[gasping for air]

11:14.274 --> 11:17.409
Darn it, Earth.
You win again.

11:18.278 --> 11:21.379
- [sighs] Max, you're
a superhero, okay?

11:21.381 --> 11:22.847
How are you supposed
to fight criminals

11:22.849 --> 11:25.850
when they can smell
you coming a mile away?

11:26.019 --> 11:28.386
- Okay, I am still super.
- Uh-huh.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.321
- Check out my heat breath.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.257
[loud belch]

11:33.560 --> 11:37.262
Just heat that up
and you'll be good to go.

11:37.564 --> 11:39.564
- Oh, great,
you ran her off.

11:39.566 --> 11:43.234
- She ran off because
she stole Colosso.

11:43.236 --> 11:44.436
- What? What makes
you think that?

11:44.438 --> 11:48.506
- 'Cause she left a note
that says "I stole Colosso!"

11:49.142 --> 11:51.609
She took him to
the pet adoption fair.

11:51.611 --> 11:54.579
- Okay, don't freak out.
Colosso's not in danger, right?

11:54.581 --> 11:57.582
He's one of the most evil
supervillains of all time.

11:57.584 --> 12:00.285
Oh, we should
probably go get him.

12:05.025 --> 12:06.458
- ¶

12:06.460 --> 12:09.060
- Okay, for the millionth
time--I'm sorry.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.261
- Sorry your nut
ball friend

12:10.263 --> 12:13.331
stole the world's most
adorable supervillain?

12:13.333 --> 12:15.200
- Yes?
- You're not forgiven!

12:15.202 --> 12:16.735
- Max, I'm gonna
fix this, okay?

12:16.737 --> 12:18.670
I will do everything
in my power to make sure

12:18.672 --> 12:22.240
Colosso never finds
a loving home. Let's go!

12:23.610 --> 12:26.211
Ma'am, I demand to see
what you're snuggling.

12:26.213 --> 12:26.845
- [snake hissing]

12:26.847 --> 12:29.447
- PHOEBE: [squeals]
Ah, it's a snake.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.350
- Molly's over there.
Let's go.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.718
- All right.
Hey, bunny thief!

12:33.720 --> 12:36.254
You stole Dr. Colosso
and my brother wants him back.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.089
- Too bad.
He's already been rescued

12:38.091 --> 12:40.525
by a loving,
nurturing owner.

12:42.195 --> 12:46.231
- I've been so lonely since
my old pet, Chesterfield, left.

12:46.233 --> 12:50.602
I bet you can't wait to
snuggle with Papa Tad.

12:52.439 --> 12:55.573
- How has my life
come to this?

12:56.510 --> 12:59.244
- See? Colosso's better
off without you.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.412
Stay away from him!!

13:02.582 --> 13:05.216
- Well, Bradford's never
gonna hand Colosso over.

13:05.218 --> 13:05.784
He hates us.

13:05.786 --> 13:09.387
- No, no, no. I am not gonna
let Sad Tad ruin our lives.

13:09.389 --> 13:12.257
We just have to follow him
home and steal Colosso back.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.658
And nothing is getting
in our way.

13:13.660 --> 13:16.227
- [snake hissing]
- [squeals] Snake!

13:16.229 --> 13:20.865
- ¶

13:20.867 --> 13:25.136
- CRIME BUDDY: Are you ready
to do the crime boogie?

13:25.138 --> 13:26.805
- [music playing]

13:26.807 --> 13:29.307
- Freeze when the music stops.

13:29.309 --> 13:32.377
- I wish this pre-school
party would stop.

13:32.379 --> 13:35.580
- CRIME BUDDY: Don't
complain, t-t-t-train!

13:35.582 --> 13:36.548
- [music continues]

13:36.550 --> 13:39.350
[music stops]
- Good job not moving.

13:39.352 --> 13:43.521
Level 2: Cleared.
- [music playing]

13:43.523 --> 13:44.522
- This is crazy.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.457
Mom and Dad are still
training us like babies.

13:46.459 --> 13:50.228
But we know we can handle
real grown-up training, right?

13:50.230 --> 13:51.596
- Yeah.
- We took down villains.

13:51.598 --> 13:54.265
We shouldn't be wasting
time on this baby bot.

13:54.267 --> 13:54.933
Right?
- Yeah!

13:54.935 --> 13:56.701
- You're gonna go crank
up that crime bot

13:56.703 --> 13:58.436
to the meanie-weanie level.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.305
Right?
- No!

14:01.608 --> 14:03.308
Mom and Dad said
that we're not ready.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.643
- Then let's prove
them wrong.

14:09.583 --> 14:14.285
- CRIME BUDDY: Leveling up.
Stand by.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.553
- Hey, let's go
get a snack

14:15.555 --> 14:16.387
while this thing
levels up.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.289
- Yeah. Then we'll
come back and show

14:18.291 --> 14:20.825
this goofy little
robot who's boss.

14:20.827 --> 14:24.729
- CRIME BUDDY:
[whirring]

14:27.500 --> 14:30.735
Meanie-weanie mode:
Complete.

14:30.737 --> 14:33.171
- I think he's the boss.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.173
- [laser zaps]

14:35.842 --> 14:38.676
- I miss the bubbles.

14:42.949 --> 14:45.817
- [whistling]

14:49.256 --> 14:50.221
- This makes no sense.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.390
We've been following him
around town for an hour.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.625
Why didn't he go home?

14:53.627 --> 14:55.360
- [pounding locker]

14:55.362 --> 14:57.328
Tad Bradford.

15:02.836 --> 15:06.771
- 'Cause he lives here
in a locker bed.

15:07.841 --> 15:09.774
- Welcome to the Tad Pad.

15:09.776 --> 15:11.342
Oh, hey, would you
like to see

15:11.344 --> 15:14.779
my old high school yearbook,
Mr. Snuggly-Poo?

15:14.781 --> 15:19.651
Oh, you're so excited,
you're shivering.

15:19.986 --> 15:24.255
Uh, ooh, this is me with
my girlfriend, Valerie.

15:24.257 --> 15:27.425
This is me and my
roller-skating gang.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.460
Respect!

15:29.462 --> 15:30.762
- [quietly groaning]

15:30.764 --> 15:34.565
- This is me thinking
this is hilarious.

15:35.669 --> 15:36.367
- I can't laugh.

15:36.369 --> 15:39.237
Allison broke my heart
and my funny bone.

15:39.239 --> 15:40.238
- Would you forget
about Allison

15:40.240 --> 15:41.839
and focus on getting
Colosso back.

15:41.841 --> 15:43.975
We'll just have to wait
for Bradford to fall asleep,

15:43.977 --> 15:45.677
so we can grab Colosso
and get outta here.

15:45.679 --> 15:50.248
- Oh, and this is me playing
Homecoming with my band--

15:50.250 --> 15:53.418
the Red Hot Chili Bradfords.

15:53.420 --> 15:56.487
Yeah, that's right.
I can still hit the high notes.

15:56.489 --> 15:57.622
¶ Yeah yeah you know it ¶

15:57.624 --> 16:00.725
[high note screeching]
¶ Ahhhh ¶

16:03.463 --> 16:05.697
- Amazing.
[laughs]

16:05.699 --> 16:08.766
Seriously, nothing?
All right.

16:10.937 --> 16:13.938
- ¶

16:13.940 --> 16:17.408
- The Crime Buddy won't
stop looking for us.

16:17.410 --> 16:18.977
What are we supposed to do?

16:18.979 --> 16:19.811
- Just stay put.

16:19.813 --> 16:20.945
It's gotta give up
sooner or later.

16:20.947 --> 16:25.483
- CRIME BUDDY: Engage
infrared loser scan.

16:25.485 --> 16:28.686
- [dramatic music]

16:28.688 --> 16:31.789
- [scan beeping]

16:32.559 --> 16:34.859
- CRIME BUDDY:
Losers targeted.

16:34.861 --> 16:37.328
- Oh, good, he found
some losers.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.997
- We're the losers!

16:38.999 --> 16:41.532
- [laser zapping]
- [metal dings]

16:41.534 --> 16:42.500
- Thanks, Billy.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.770
You know what? Let's just
stand up to this Tin Man.

16:45.772 --> 16:49.007
Hey, Metal Head!
You're goin' down.

16:49.009 --> 16:51.609
- [lasers zapping]

16:51.611 --> 16:53.878
- CRIME BUDDY:
[powering down]

16:53.880 --> 16:56.714
You have defeated
the Crime Buddy.

16:56.716 --> 16:57.882
- BILLY & NORA:
Yes!

16:57.884 --> 17:00.351
- CRIME BUDDY: [powering up]
Just kidding!

17:00.353 --> 17:03.354
You are dumb
as well as weak.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.523
- BILLY & NORA:
[screaming]

17:05.525 --> 17:06.724
- I can't wait to see

17:06.726 --> 17:08.359
how Billy and Nora did
while we were gone.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.995
- Yeah, I bet they're givin'
that Crime Buddy the business.

17:10.997 --> 17:12.397
- HANK: Mm-hm.
[laughs]

17:12.399 --> 17:15.033
- CRIME BUDDY:
Prepare to be destroyed.

17:15.035 --> 17:17.035
- Let go of my babies!

17:17.037 --> 17:20.038
[electrical zapping]

17:20.040 --> 17:25.510
- Your challenge
is accepted, Shocker Mom.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.645
- They're not scared of you.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.981
But I am.
[whooshing]

17:30.150 --> 17:31.649
- [laser zaps]
- HANK: Hey!

17:31.651 --> 17:36.821
My mom made that coat rack out
of the first tree I flew into.

17:36.823 --> 17:41.492
- CRIME BUDDY:
Get a tissue, Mama's Boy.

17:41.661 --> 17:45.129
- Oh, ho, ho, that's it.
You're outta here.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.366
- [lasers zapping]

17:51.104 --> 17:53.438
- [plaster thudding]

17:55.008 --> 17:56.407
- BARB:
Are you guys okay?

17:56.409 --> 17:57.408
- Yeah.
- We're fine.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.810
- I'm gonna call
the Hero League right now

17:58.812 --> 18:00.611
to tell them their
robot malfunctioned.

18:00.613 --> 18:01.546
- Does "malfunction" mean

18:01.548 --> 18:04.048
Nora and I set it
to meanie-weanie?

18:05.852 --> 18:08.653
- No, Billy, it doesn't.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.588
- You upped the level?

18:10.590 --> 18:13.057
- We told you guys
you weren't ready.

18:13.059 --> 18:14.692
- And we believe you--

18:14.694 --> 18:15.560
now.

18:15.562 --> 18:16.794
- We just wanted
to show you

18:16.796 --> 18:19.097
we're mature superheroes,
not little kids.

18:19.099 --> 18:23.101
- Well, mature heroes understand
that they don't know everything.

18:23.103 --> 18:26.838
If you wanna fight crime,
take one step at a time.

18:26.840 --> 18:30.708
- Oh, you are on fire!
- Right!

18:32.579 --> 18:33.611
- We understand.

18:33.613 --> 18:37.515
- Good, because your next step
is cleaning up this house.

18:37.517 --> 18:38.583
- NORA & BILLY:
Awww...

18:38.585 --> 18:39.684
- Don't "awww" me.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.152
How do you think
Gam-Gam's gonna feel

18:41.154 --> 18:44.522
when she sees
her busted coat rack?

18:46.726 --> 18:49.827
- That was the best
year of my life--

18:49.829 --> 18:52.630
aside from
the dolphin attack.

18:53.433 --> 18:54.599
So...

18:54.601 --> 18:56.200
- [whispering]
Oh, finally.

18:56.202 --> 18:57.135
- [grunts]

18:57.137 --> 18:58.736
- Why doesn't
he go to sleep?

18:58.738 --> 19:02.039
If my life was this bad,
I'd sleep all the time.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.274
- Come on,
Mr. Snuggly-Poo,

19:03.276 --> 19:05.576
let's go get in
our matching jammies.

19:05.578 --> 19:09.580
- Please let me wake up
from this nightmare.

19:10.016 --> 19:10.948
- Gotta close ya up.

19:10.950 --> 19:15.186
Can't take any chances
after Chesterfield ran away.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.022
[talking baby talk]

19:18.024 --> 19:19.891
- Okay, we've gotta
come up with a plan.

19:19.893 --> 19:20.892
- You come up with a plan.

19:20.894 --> 19:22.994
My powers don't
even work anymore.

19:22.996 --> 19:25.496
All I'm good for
now is eating pizza

19:25.498 --> 19:28.065
and watching everyone
I love leave me.

19:28.067 --> 19:30.101
- Okay, that's it!

19:31.871 --> 19:33.571
Really?

19:36.009 --> 19:37.775
Max, I know this
break-up was hard on you,

19:37.777 --> 19:39.544
but there will be
plenty of other girls

19:39.546 --> 19:40.878
who will be happy
to date you.

19:40.880 --> 19:41.913
- Phoebe,
you don't get it.

19:41.915 --> 19:46.184
Allison can't be replaced
by some random stranger.

19:46.186 --> 19:48.653
She's my first
real girlfriend.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.788
She really understood me.

19:52.659 --> 19:55.092
- Wow, Max.
I had no idea.

19:55.094 --> 19:56.694
Look, I'm sorry.
I just...

19:56.696 --> 19:59.664
Look, I was afraid that if you
didn't snap out of this now,

19:59.666 --> 20:00.898
that you'd be
a sad sack forever.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.201
A lot of people let
break-ups ruin their lives.

20:03.203 --> 20:05.636
- BRADFORD:
[whistling]

20:07.774 --> 20:09.507
The truth is,
Mr. Snuggly-Poo,

20:09.509 --> 20:11.209
getting dumped by
Valerie ruined my life.

20:11.211 --> 20:16.147
Now, 20 years later, I live
in a queen-sized locker.

20:20.853 --> 20:23.554
- Wow, I can't believe
one break-up

20:23.556 --> 20:24.555
turned him into that.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.124
- Yeah. Are you gonna let
this break-up with Allison

20:27.126 --> 20:29.527
do the same to you?

20:29.529 --> 20:31.596
- ¶

20:31.598 --> 20:34.632
- Outta my way,
delinquents!

20:34.634 --> 20:37.802
And show some respect
for Principal Maxford.

20:37.971 --> 20:41.138
Ow!
Who's throwin' oranges?!

20:41.140 --> 20:43.307
I hate this school.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.577
This break-up
won't break me.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.714
Phoebe, distract Bradford
so I can grab Colosso.

20:49.716 --> 20:50.314
- Right. Uh...

20:50.316 --> 20:53.718
- [powers whooshing]
- [garbage can clattering]

20:55.588 --> 20:56.287
- What was that?

20:56.289 --> 20:58.656
Oh, the lunch lady
better not still be

20:58.658 --> 21:01.158
livin' in
the teachers' lounge.

21:01.594 --> 21:06.230
This school's not big enough
for the both of us, Gladys!

21:10.203 --> 21:12.570
- Hey, buddy, we're
here to rescue you.

21:12.572 --> 21:13.237
- Oh, thanks, Max.

21:13.239 --> 21:16.040
Does this mean you want
me to put on the wig?

21:16.042 --> 21:17.008
- What wig?

21:17.010 --> 21:19.577
- [girly voice]
You'll find out.

21:20.113 --> 21:23.981
- BRADFORD: I hear
you talking, Gladys!

21:24.884 --> 21:26.884
If you wanna live
in this school,

21:26.886 --> 21:28.986
become the principal!

21:28.988 --> 21:30.321
- Phoebe's in trouble.

21:30.323 --> 21:31.789
[blowing frosty air]

21:31.791 --> 21:34.058
- BRADFORD:
[thudding]

21:36.029 --> 21:36.894
- PHOEBE:
Thanks, Max.

21:36.896 --> 21:38.195
Hey, your powers
are back to normal.

21:38.197 --> 21:40.298
- Hey, let's talk
about that at home.

21:40.300 --> 21:40.998
- Right.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.833
- BRADFORD:
No. Ah.

21:42.835 --> 21:46.170
Mr. Snuggly-Poo's gone.
[sobbing]

21:46.172 --> 21:47.872
He was all I had.

21:47.874 --> 21:50.174
- [squeaking]

21:50.176 --> 21:52.777
Chesterfield?

21:52.779 --> 21:56.947
You came home
to Papa Tad.

21:59.319 --> 22:01.652
- He's best friends
with a rat.

22:01.654 --> 22:02.253
[laughing]

22:02.255 --> 22:05.189
- It's so good
to have you back.

22:10.997 --> 22:26.944
- ¶
