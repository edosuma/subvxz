WEBVTT

00:04.520 --> 00:05.370
This...

00:05.370 --> 00:07.000
is a car program.

00:07.480 --> 00:09.290
There will be no cushions.

00:09.460 --> 00:11.570
There will be no rag rolling.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.400
No one will sing

00:13.400 --> 00:16.810
and at the end of the series, no
one will have a recording contract.

00:18.250 --> 00:20.520
This, is our new base.

00:21.490 --> 00:24.070
And this is our purpose built test track.

00:24.080 --> 00:29.340
There are no traffic jams here, well, apart
from this one, and no bus lanes either.

00:30.700 --> 00:32.600
This... is Top Gear

00:35.740 --> 00:36.870
And in the show tonight

00:36.870 --> 00:39.020
I put two supercars head to head,

00:41.130 --> 00:44.990
Jason Dawe on what to do when car dealers attack,

00:47.400 --> 00:50.520
Richard Hammond will try to beat a speed camera,

00:51.390 --> 00:54.520
And a star, in a reasonably priced car.

01:00.240 --> 01:01.030
Hello.

01:01.030 --> 01:03.380
Now, two family hatchbacks,

01:03.380 --> 01:05.710
the Ford Focus and the Volkswagen Golf.

01:05.710 --> 01:07.360
Both have five doors...

01:07.380 --> 01:12.070
both have 1.6 liter engines
and both cost around 12,000 pounds.

01:12.300 --> 01:15.720
That's how much family hatchbacks cost.

01:16.360 --> 01:17.520
Or do they?

01:17.970 --> 01:23.630
You see on Top Gear, we found one that you
can buy, in Britain, no tricks, brand new...

01:23.630 --> 01:25.800
for less than 9,000 pounds.

01:26.250 --> 01:26.990
This is it.

01:26.990 --> 01:30.980
It's the Citroen Berlingo Multispace and I admit...

01:30.980 --> 01:32.550
it's a curious looking thing.

01:32.920 --> 01:35.870
That's because it started out in life, as a van.

01:35.870 --> 01:43.590
All they've done is add some windows here, sliding
doors and snazzy seats where the cement used to go...

01:43.590 --> 01:45.240
and hey presto.

01:45.330 --> 01:47.890
Garnish it with some metallic
paint, some allow wheels,

01:47.890 --> 01:53.130
and you can even have a diesel
version for 8,995 pounds.

01:53.480 --> 01:56.120
Thing is though, are you
getting what you paid for?

01:56.120 --> 01:57.340
Is it like cheap wine?

01:57.340 --> 01:59.400
Will you wake up, with a headache?

01:59.800 --> 02:03.930
Well, to find out, i took it
down the M20, to the Booze Borough.

02:03.930 --> 02:07.520
For a trip to those... supermarkets of Calais.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.630
First impressions are that i'm driving...

02:10.630 --> 02:12.020
a van.

02:12.700 --> 02:16.230
It's quite echoey in here and not terribly refined, erm...

02:17.010 --> 02:20.480
most central locking systems, for
instance, these days they go...

02:20.480 --> 02:22.420
*bzzz* or *kheew*...

02:22.420 --> 02:23.640
but listen to this.

02:26.390 --> 02:27.930
It's very uncouth.

02:30.120 --> 02:32.190
In essence then, the Berlingo is...

02:32.190 --> 02:33.130
very loud.

02:33.130 --> 02:35.130
Very, Van Halen.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.980
But, there is a softer...

02:38.980 --> 02:40.980
Van Morisson option.

02:45.520 --> 02:50.140
For the same money, you can have a 1.6
liter petrol engine which develops

02:50.140 --> 02:53.300
the same power, as a Mk1 Golf GTI.

02:54.070 --> 02:58.510
With that under the bonnet, this would
feel much more like a normal car.

03:01.110 --> 03:01.750
But,

03:01.750 --> 03:06.800
how many normal cars have you ever come
across that have got green dashboards with

03:06.800 --> 03:08.150
green dials.

03:08.520 --> 03:09.200
And,

03:09.280 --> 03:13.290
how many normal cars are their with
five glass panels in the roof

03:13.290 --> 03:16.420
and these roof bars which, swivel sideways

03:16.420 --> 03:18.420
so you can carry a bicycle.

03:19.660 --> 03:21.340
Whatever a bicycle is.

03:23.090 --> 03:28.360
No doubt about it, the Berlingo is turning
out to be astonishing value for money

03:30.000 --> 03:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:39.190 --> 03:43.090
It is possible to buy... a number
of other cars for Berlingo money

03:43.360 --> 03:45.490
But none of them will be this size.

03:45.490 --> 03:47.660
None of them will be this well equipped.

03:47.660 --> 03:49.100
And none of them will have something,

03:49.330 --> 03:52.320
that we're really looking for
on this new series of Top Gear.

03:52.690 --> 03:53.930
It's an X factor.

03:54.430 --> 03:58.410
See, this, this is a perfectly acceptable car but this

03:59.240 --> 04:01.410
I dunno, it's more than a car somehow.

04:02.560 --> 04:05.410
You want to bring it in at
night, let it sit by the fire.

04:06.170 --> 04:09.170
Give it a saucer of warm milk and
a little wheel to run around in.

04:10.300 --> 04:14.120
It's got the most important
thing that a car can have...

04:15.130 --> 04:16.290
character.

04:20.950 --> 04:23.720
And now the coal is back in Newcastle.

04:23.700 --> 04:25.700
The Berlingo is back...

04:25.700 --> 04:27.700
where it came from.

04:29.190 --> 04:31.940
And I still can't find anything, really wrong with it.

04:32.820 --> 04:37.050
The turning circle's not much cop
and there's a fair bit of road noise.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.490
It's not terribly sporty either.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.120
But it is very comfortable.

04:43.350 --> 04:44.530
Hand on heart...

04:44.530 --> 04:46.530
it rides like a Jaguar.

04:49.940 --> 04:55.610
I could go on all day giving you swings and
roundabouts but the fact of the matter is, basically...

04:55.670 --> 04:56.600
I like it.

04:59.290 --> 05:01.330
Right, here we are at one of those...

05:01.330 --> 05:05.830
Calais hypermarket, cash-and-carry, booze warehouse jobs

05:05.830 --> 05:06.990
and boy!

05:06.990 --> 05:08.990
Have I got the car for the job.

05:12.350 --> 05:13.650
Let me show you what I mean.

05:13.650 --> 05:16.050
We've got storage space up here,

05:16.050 --> 05:17.100
up here,

05:17.100 --> 05:19.100
and here above the driver.

05:19.100 --> 05:21.640
In the back, there are two

05:21.640 --> 05:23.150
extra glove boxes.

05:23.150 --> 05:24.060
And then,

05:24.740 --> 05:28.660
If we slide that open we've got
a cubby hole here under the floor,

05:28.660 --> 05:30.660
and another one there.

05:30.660 --> 05:33.820
Then we simply fold the seats down,

05:33.840 --> 05:36.860
like... so.

05:36.860 --> 05:39.910
And we have, a cavernous boot.

05:40.450 --> 05:42.310
And, I haven't finished yet.

05:42.310 --> 05:44.580
Because, if we open the tailgate

05:44.580 --> 05:47.060
there's another overhead locker here,

05:47.060 --> 05:50.130
for a further ten kilograms of booze.

05:50.710 --> 05:51.370
So,

05:52.440 --> 05:53.370
let's shop.

05:59.810 --> 06:01.670
I want, um, that one.

06:01.670 --> 06:03.670
That case there.

06:03.670 --> 06:06.910
It's terribly exciting all this cheap booze,

06:06.910 --> 06:08.500
but you have to be careful.

06:08.500 --> 06:11.310
Because if customs suspect
you're bringing stuff back

06:11.330 --> 06:13.870
that's not for your own personal consumption,

06:13.910 --> 06:16.080
they'll confiscate it and your car.

06:16.100 --> 06:19.770
And they're currently confiscating thirty cars a day.

06:20.130 --> 06:24.400
So I caught up with the shop's owner,
and his girlfriend, to talk about this.

06:24.890 --> 06:27.640
Because the... I was... reading in the paper,

06:27.640 --> 06:32.020
that if I we're to put five hundred bottles of
gin in the car which i'm legally allowed to do

06:32.020 --> 06:32.450
Absolutely.

06:32.450 --> 06:35.090
Customs are so, "well you'd never get through all that."

06:35.090 --> 06:35.880
Well, how, how,

06:35.880 --> 06:40.270
how can they say that when there's Maggie
Thatcher told us to stock our larders up.

06:40.270 --> 06:41.240
I mean...

06:41.240 --> 06:42.920
With five hundred bottles of gin

06:42.920 --> 06:43.270
Yeah, but...

06:43.270 --> 06:47.950
if you, if you drink a bottle of gin a day,
that, that's only a year and a half supply.

06:47.950 --> 06:49.640
That's not a lot.

06:50.280 --> 06:52.580
Fizzy... Liebfraumilch.

06:53.590 --> 06:57.610
I don't think i'll be able to convince
customs that's for my personal consumption.

06:58.830 --> 06:59.590
No.

07:01.100 --> 07:03.060
Other people were going berserk,

07:03.060 --> 07:05.440
perhaps because they didn't like their cars very much.

07:05.870 --> 07:08.240
Perhaps they wanted to have them squashed.

07:08.860 --> 07:11.030
Trouble is, I really am.. very...

07:11.610 --> 07:14.360
very fond of this car and I don't want customs

07:14.360 --> 07:16.360
to crush it, so

07:18.670 --> 07:19.890
there we are.

07:20.530 --> 07:22.010
Saved a few quid.

07:22.010 --> 07:24.010
Well, pence.

07:27.010 --> 07:30.460
Now, I should explain at this
point that other vans are available.

07:30.460 --> 07:33.920
There's the Fiat Doblo which is
a trifle cheaper than this,

07:33.920 --> 07:35.870
but I think i'm right in saying

07:35.870 --> 07:39.150
it's the slowest accelerating car
that money can buy in Britain today.

07:39.150 --> 07:41.810
uh, 0-60 is 21 seconds.

07:42.160 --> 07:45.260
Then there's the Ford Tourneo Connect,

07:45.260 --> 07:48.970
that's over 10,000 pounds, you don't
even wanna think about that, so awful,

07:48.970 --> 07:54.840
erm... And the there's the Renault... Kangoo,
that's okay, but basically it's not as good as this.

07:54.840 --> 07:56.490
You have to have, a Berlingo.

07:56.490 --> 07:57.710
Question is,

07:57.710 --> 07:59.500
diesel or petrol?

07:59.500 --> 08:04.680
Well to help us decide that, i've been
joined now by Top Gear's new car trader,

08:05.240 --> 08:07.960
pocket sized chap, Jason Dawe, what do you reckon?

08:08.190 --> 08:08.850
Petrol.

08:08.850 --> 08:09.430
Really?

08:09.430 --> 08:10.850
Yeah, don't bother with the diesel,

08:10.850 --> 08:12.220
makes it feel too much like a van.

08:12.220 --> 08:14.340
Well it did feel like that, going
down the motorway there was that

08:14.430 --> 08:17.210
*rrrrgh* noise and you just think,
look i've saved enough money here.

08:17.210 --> 08:18.550
Yeah, but you can save more at the minute.

08:18.550 --> 08:19.100
Really?

08:19.100 --> 08:21.240
Yup, they are doing a facelift on this car,

08:21.240 --> 08:25.260
which means they're going to change the bumpers and the bonnet
and a couple of bits, but it'll basically look the same.

08:25.260 --> 08:27.870
What it does mean is that Citroen
have got some of the old models,

08:27.870 --> 08:28.850
they need to get short of them.

08:28.850 --> 08:29.880
These ones, basically?

08:29.530 --> 08:31.340
Yeah, yeah, this car.

08:29.880 --> 08:30.510
This car?

08:31.310 --> 08:31.750
Yup.

08:31.750 --> 08:32.470
So what are they doing?

08:32.470 --> 08:36.260
They're doing a deal where you can get all of
that off, so that means instead of 8,995 pounds,

08:36.260 --> 08:39.490
you can get a 1.4 for 7,700 pounds.

08:39.490 --> 08:41.490
7,700 pounds for ones of these?

08:40.450 --> 08:41.530
7,700 pounds yeah.

08:42.299 --> 08:43.840
That's the bargain of the century.

08:43.630 --> 08:44.560
Cheap as chips.

08:45.130 --> 08:46.180
Good tip.

08:46.740 --> 08:53.150
Right, if I could just sum it up, it's like Gerard Depardieu.
Slightly swollen middle, broken nose, but there are...

08:53.150 --> 08:54.370
hidden talents.

08:54.370 --> 08:57.730
And it's not just me who likes it.
Everyone in the Top Gear office likes it.

08:57.730 --> 09:00.120
All the crew here like it.
Everyone,well, apart from him.

09:00.120 --> 09:02.740
He doesn't like it very
much, but everyone else does.

09:02.740 --> 09:09.910
erm... And the people who like it most of all are the family of
Albanians that are inadvertently brought back into Britain

09:09.910 --> 09:15.420
in each of the wheel arches. They've written to me
from their new house in Leatherhead, the Hollys, to say

09:15.420 --> 09:18.520
that it will always hold a
special place in their heart.

09:19.430 --> 09:20.520
Great car.

09:21.110 --> 09:25.360
You know how, when you're making up a list,
as you do, of the world's greatest racecars,

09:25.360 --> 09:28.560
you've just got to include the Ford GT40.

09:28.560 --> 09:30.560
And here's a reminder... why.

10:11.430 --> 10:14.300
So they built one of the most successful racecars ever.

10:14.300 --> 10:15.260
Great.

10:15.260 --> 10:21.970
But that gave them a problem. Because try as they might, they
struggled for years to build anything remotely as glamorous ever again.

10:21.970 --> 10:23.870
Until they came up with a really good idea.

10:23.870 --> 10:27.810
The best car to replace the Ford GT40, was...

10:27.810 --> 10:29.140
The Ford GT40.

10:29.140 --> 10:32.890
I mean, this is the new car, and
come on, you're not fooling anyone.

10:32.890 --> 10:37.290
It's okay, four inches higher and eighteen
inches longer than the original GT40,

10:37.290 --> 10:43.460
but it is a GT40. Basically they put the plans
for the old car on a photocopier at 110% and said...

10:43.460 --> 10:44.480
enlarge.

10:44.480 --> 10:48.580
But is a lot cleverer than the old one.
It's loaded with technology. Take a look at this.

10:48.580 --> 10:51.060
So you wanna see the engine? Right, there it goes.

10:51.060 --> 10:52.700
That's actually going to take a moment or two.

10:52.700 --> 10:59.210
In the meantime. You've pulled into a petrol forecourt, obviously everybody's
gonna be looking at you, but if they're not, this should tip it.

10:59.210 --> 11:01.200
Have a go. Here we go, let's get to the fuel.

11:01.200 --> 11:02.290
Look at that!

11:03.070 --> 11:05.400
That's just to put your petrol in.

11:05.640 --> 11:09.040
That's unbelievable. We can possibly squeeze
in and have a look at the engine now.

11:09.040 --> 11:15.750
It's a 5.4 liter V8, supercharged. that's about
500 brake horsepower. That should be enough.

11:15.750 --> 11:18.350
Bear in mind this is a very, very light car indeed.

11:18.350 --> 11:19.740
But take a look inside.

11:19.740 --> 11:20.550
You've gotta have a look.

11:20.550 --> 11:23.320
This is just... it's just breathtaking.

11:23.360 --> 11:27.870
Look at the switches. Each one looks
hand carved from a lump of aluminium.

11:27.870 --> 11:30.530
And the gate around the base of the gear lever,

11:30.530 --> 11:31.440
look at that.

11:31.440 --> 11:34.560
None of that nasty rubber full of
bits of biscuits and old chocolate.

11:34.890 --> 11:37.000
Course, this isn't real,

11:37.000 --> 11:38.220
it's a pretend one.

11:38.220 --> 11:40.340
I dunno what it'll be like when they make it.

11:40.340 --> 11:42.120
And, oh yes, they are gonna make it.

11:42.120 --> 11:46.150
Ford have announced this week they
will be putting this into production.

11:46.150 --> 11:47.340
But it's gonna be expensive.

11:47.340 --> 11:52.280
It's gonna be on sale in America
from 2004 at about $150,000 apiece.

11:52.450 --> 11:56.320
And you're gonna be very, very lucky, even if
you've got the money to get a hold of one.

11:56.320 --> 11:58.670
They're gonna be incredibly exclusive.

11:58.670 --> 12:01.890
Basically, you're gonna have to know somebody at Ford.

12:02.540 --> 12:11.890
Other items in the news this week, the Government has announced it's going to spend
145 million pounds on the road network over the next five years which works out at,

12:11.890 --> 12:19.000
29 million pounds a year and that's enough to 
pay for three and a half miles of motorway a year.

12:19.050 --> 12:21.790
Wow, so you think of the freedom you can enjoy with that.

12:21.790 --> 12:23.070
I know, looking forward to it.

12:21.790 --> 12:23.050
Three miles a year.

12:23.050 --> 12:23.920
I can't wait.

12:23.050 --> 12:24.930
Three new mil... three new miles of motorway.

12:23.890 --> 12:24.860
I'm excited.

12:24.860 --> 12:26.410
Car news? erm...

12:26.410 --> 12:31.880
Fiat, first of all, they are in deep trouble.
They're currently losing 2 million pounds a day.

12:31.880 --> 12:35.420
Well, they're got a new model which
they think is going to stem the flow.

12:35.420 --> 12:36.290
There it is.

12:36.290 --> 12:37.910
Look at that, they're saved.

12:38.030 --> 12:40.020
They've saved. No, they'll be fine with that.

12:40.020 --> 12:43.600
It's an estate version of the Stilo and, erm...

12:43.600 --> 12:50.110
it is actually very important this works because, if
Fiat goes to the wall, they will take with them,

12:50.110 --> 12:57.320
Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Maserati and Ferrari and of course they won't go
to the wall cause they're gonna get bought by General Motors.

12:57.320 --> 13:02.210
So, if you don't buy one of these, General
Motors gets Ferrari. It's that simple.

13:02.210 --> 13:03.180
So buy one.

13:04.030 --> 13:05.620
News now of the new Micra.

13:05.620 --> 13:08.200
erm.. A rather gorgeous looking little thing as well.

13:08.200 --> 13:12.690
That's, erm... that's actually not it though,
that's the only thing, lovely though it is.

13:09.300 --> 13:09.970
mmm...

13:11.540 --> 13:12.410
Ah...

13:12.690 --> 13:14.040
They will do that eventually. This...

13:14.090 --> 13:17.620
is gonna be the new Micra,
which is, well it's alright.

13:17.620 --> 13:20.050
That's not bad. I've always
quite liked the Mirca myself.

13:20.050 --> 13:23.650
The important thing about it though
is, loaded with technology even in a small car.

13:23.650 --> 13:26.520
It's even gonna have a new... you've
probably seen this; keyless entry.

13:26.520 --> 13:28.670
So you walk upto the car and, and then you can...

13:27.940 --> 13:29.190
No, i've got some experience about... there

13:29.190 --> 13:34.720
There is a slight problem with it because you keep a little smart card in your
wallet, okay, you get out of the car, push a little button, doors locked.

13:34.720 --> 13:38.170
You walk away and you think, is that locked?

13:38.170 --> 13:42.710
So you walk back to check, of course it recognises
the smart card and sees you coming, it's open

13:42.710 --> 13:44.710
uhh... uhh...

13:44.500 --> 13:46.710
You could be there for days.

13:45.670 --> 13:48.960
You couldn't, you just.. the only way you
know if it wasn't locked is if someone nicks it.

13:48.960 --> 13:51.270
Yeah, that's the only way you can find out for definite.

13:51.350 --> 13:55.490
Now this, erm, we all know the Smart...

13:55.490 --> 13:58.720
the one that's been around for a few years,
the one you could park nose onto the pavement...

13:58.720 --> 14:00.380
but now they've got delusions of granduer...

14:00.380 --> 14:03.370
and they've launched, well I think we've got some footage of it here.

14:03.370 --> 14:07.160
Two versions, there's a coupe, and there is a...

14:07.160 --> 14:07.920
cabriolet.

14:07.920 --> 14:11.820
Now the cabriolet is interesting. You've got an elecric folding roof...

14:11.820 --> 14:14.770
rear engine, with a turbocharger on it.

14:14.770 --> 14:21.810
You've got rear wheel drive, big fat alloys, anti-lock
brakes, traction control. Basically just like a 911 Turbo.

14:22.350 --> 14:25.280
Okay? Except a 911 Turbo is 90,000 pounds.

14:25.280 --> 14:27.370
This, the car you're looking at here

14:27.370 --> 14:29.680
11,750.

14:31.920 --> 14:37.580
That was the least convincing <i>ooh</i> noise
I've ever head in my life, but i mean 11,750.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.770
That, that is incredible actually.

14:38.770 --> 14:40.770
If this is the future, now, here...

14:40.770 --> 14:45.190
I'm not scared of that anymore, you can bring
it on. Take as much of the future as you like.

14:45.190 --> 14:46.820
That's stunning, 11,000 pounds.

14:45.920 --> 14:48.630
erm... Take a moment now to talk about Forumla 1.

14:48.650 --> 14:51.370
What are we going to do about Formula 1?

14:51.540 --> 14:52.290
yeah...

14:52.250 --> 14:53.590
Scrap it?

14:54.250 --> 14:54.810
Kill...

14:54.810 --> 14:56.000
No the problem i've got...

14:56.000 --> 14:56.970
I've been working that out...

14:56.970 --> 14:58.970
The problem here, is very simple...

14:58.970 --> 15:00.970
...is that...

15:00.970 --> 15:03.150
Ferrari have completely dominated the...

15:03.150 --> 15:08.470
Now we've got a photograph of what Michael Schumacher is
gonna do next year to try and keep it, uh, there we go.

15:08.470 --> 15:10.040
That's...

15:10.540 --> 15:13.430
That's what he's gonna do next year to try and level it out a bit.

15:13.430 --> 15:16.010
But really, the problem as I see it is

15:16.010 --> 15:17.650
that, the cu...

15:17.650 --> 15:18.980
the teams have taken over.

15:18.980 --> 15:20.790
The technology has taken over.

15:20.790 --> 15:24.350
Now that they've got traction control and
gearboxes that change for you and...

15:24.350 --> 15:31.160
I heard the other day that the teams, the pit crews,
can actually tune the engine from the pit wall.

15:31.160 --> 15:32.640
Well that's... they're spanners...

15:31.500 --> 15:34.240
And they actually said, yes,"Oh no
we'll turn down the revs down a bit."

15:34.240 --> 15:35.480
No, one of them developed a fault.

15:35.480 --> 15:39.450
A BMW one, developed a fault and they rerouted
the oil, without actually bringing it in.

15:39.510 --> 15:40.530
They did it remotely.

15:40.530 --> 15:42.400
And you just think, where's the driver?

15:42.400 --> 15:44.080
The driver is the big hero.

15:44.080 --> 15:45.740
He's the guy I wanna watch.

15:45.740 --> 15:48.990
You know it was like, the Second World War,
you had fighter pilots they were the big heroes.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.610
After that, they were racing drivers.

15:50.610 --> 15:52.550
I want to see heroes.

15:52.550 --> 15:58.750
I don't wanna see geeks in, black clothes going,"ooh well if
I just fiddle with this laptop we'll make it go faster."

15:58.750 --> 16:00.560
In fact I'd execute them.

16:00.560 --> 16:01.870
Do you know... do you really...

16:01.290 --> 16:03.960
I would, i'd shoot them in the back of the neck with a 9mm.

16:03.980 --> 16:05.410
I want to see drivers take...

16:05.410 --> 16:06.890
I want Formula 1...

16:06.910 --> 16:07.780
unplugged.

16:07.780 --> 16:11.050
Rip out all the technology and give us proper racing again.

16:13.700 --> 16:15.060
Do you know Jeremy, that...

16:16.390 --> 16:18.180
That was strangely touching.

16:18.180 --> 16:19.540
Your desire for hero...

16:18.810 --> 16:20.210
But you know... I'm just fed up with this...

16:20.210 --> 16:21.540
I don't blame Ferrari.

16:21.540 --> 16:23.820
I can't blame them, you know. They
built a better car and they won.

16:23.820 --> 16:26.260
Just get rid of all the technology. Just *krrgh*

16:26.260 --> 16:29.300
I think computer animate the entire sport
and get rid of them all in real life.

16:30.070 --> 16:32.810
Right, erm, here's some stirring news for us,

16:32.810 --> 16:36.580
in that it's a very stirring car,
the new Bentley Continental GT.

16:36.580 --> 16:38.880
That is a very, very big car indeed.

16:38.880 --> 16:41.680
I think it's gorgeous, you're a bit, eeehhh... about it

16:41.680 --> 16:46.120
It's fine. It's, it's got a slight Vanessa Feltz-y rear.

16:46.120 --> 16:47.740
Yeah, there is something of her.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.190
but the important thing about the car is the engine.

16:50.190 --> 16:52.910
Right? Powering that is a W12.

16:52.910 --> 16:54.240
Massive engine.

16:54.240 --> 16:58.940
It's the same engine they put in the Volkswagen Phaeton
which I've already driven at 200 miles an hour.

16:58.940 --> 17:01.690
Exactly. They decided at Bentley, not enough.

17:01.690 --> 17:04.750
Girl stuff. Strap a couple of tubros
to it, see how it'll do then.

17:04.750 --> 17:07.140
Which is great but it's given them in interesting problem.

17:07.140 --> 17:09.859
It's now chucking out so much torque,

17:09.859 --> 17:12.569
that they can't tell us how much torque it's putting out.

17:12.569 --> 17:15.630
Everytime they strap it to the machines
that they measure it on, it breaks them.

17:15.700 --> 17:17.829
These are things the size of a building, these machines.

17:17.829 --> 17:19.829
They strap it down, tie it all in.

17:19.829 --> 17:22.310
You could tie it to this base
here and it would just spin

17:22.310 --> 17:23.710
the whole studio around.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.560
The whole hangar would just be doing that.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.579
We'd, we'd actually go around and yeah, that's exactly what would happen.

17:25.579 --> 17:27.890
So, unfortunately, they can't tell you how powerful it is.

17:27.890 --> 17:29.400
Just, lots and lots of torque.

17:29.400 --> 17:30.770
Now, bit of a challenge.

17:30.770 --> 17:32.940
Old people get quite bad press.

17:32.940 --> 17:35.560
We're forever reading about them
driving the wrong way down the motorway.

17:35.560 --> 17:36.810
I know we've got some footage

17:36.810 --> 17:38.260
from a CCTV.

17:38.260 --> 17:41.020
Here we are, little old dear going down to the seaside.

17:41.020 --> 17:41.940
Brake, brake.

17:41.940 --> 17:43.220
Oh noo..

17:43.220 --> 17:44.720
And she's... doesn't do it.

17:44.720 --> 17:47.950
And of course she turned out to be a hundred and seventy thirteen.

17:40.540 --> 17:41.660
Oh no!

17:39.760 --> 17:40.490
Oh no.

17:47.980 --> 17:49.010
erm... The thing is though,

17:49.010 --> 17:52.690
we don't think that old people
are as bad as everyone makes out.

17:52.690 --> 17:55.330
So, here's what we're going to do.

17:55.330 --> 17:58.400
We know grandmothers can make a
doughnut, but can they do one?

17:58.400 --> 18:00.210
And a doughnut is, uh...

18:00.210 --> 18:01.210
Here's the footage, okay?

18:01.210 --> 18:04.800
Here's me going round and round
in a TVR. That is a doughnut.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.280
Now, if you're a grandmother...

18:06.280 --> 18:08.700
and you have to prove you have grandchildren...

18:08.700 --> 18:11.770
and you think that with a bit of tuition, you can do that...

18:11.770 --> 18:12.990
drop us a line.

18:12.990 --> 18:17.310
The address is.... I'm a grandmother and I want to do a doughnut...

18:17.310 --> 18:23.130
Top Gear, BBC Television, Woodlane London W12 7TS.

18:23.130 --> 18:26.420
Or you can look on our website which is on an internet.

18:25.810 --> 18:26.360
Somewhere.

18:26.450 --> 18:27.030
Somewhere.

18:30.870 --> 18:33.100
Right, that is enough...

18:33.100 --> 18:36.080
old people, and enough money saving Citroen vans.

18:36.080 --> 18:38.080
Lets have a look at this. Excuse me.

18:38.080 --> 18:43.520
This is Italy's newest supercar from
Italy's newest supercar maker.

18:43.520 --> 18:45.940
It's called a Pagani Zonda.

18:45.940 --> 18:48.560
And it is, exquisite.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.540
It's exquisite on the inside too.

18:50.540 --> 18:52.540
Look at this. Just a...

18:52.540 --> 18:55.580
Wool, a lap of aluminium and...

18:55.580 --> 18:57.590
chamois leather and carbon fibre...

18:57.590 --> 19:00.180
and look at these air vents, they're like periscopes

19:00.180 --> 19:03.070
erm... Anyone wanna see the engine?

19:03.070 --> 19:08.390
Right, well lets hop out and we have to... 
Could you just grab the other side?

19:08.390 --> 19:11.350
erm... You have to undo the leather buckle...

19:11.350 --> 19:14.770
very 21st century, push the little button, okay?

19:14.770 --> 19:17.420
And there it is. Look at that.

19:18.780 --> 19:22.570
That's a Mercedes Benz 7.3 liter...

19:22.800 --> 19:24.100
V12.

19:24.100 --> 19:25.160
You wanna hear it?

19:26.890 --> 19:28.780
Problem is, Health & Safety, okay?

19:28.780 --> 19:31.430
They've told us we mustn't start cars in the studio.

19:31.430 --> 19:34.240
Alright? But, uh, I don't think they'll hear.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.080
Are we ready?

19:35.080 --> 19:37.390
Foot in the clutch, Jeremy, that will help.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.600
I think we got away with that.
I don't think they heard us.

19:53.600 --> 19:57.580
erm... Now, do you want to know,
what it feels like to drive?

19:58.530 --> 19:59.580
Watch this.

20:06.750 --> 20:11.430
The similarities between the Zonda
and an F-15 fighter are obvious.

20:11.430 --> 20:15.500
Both have glassy bubble roofs at the
front and a lot of engine behind.

20:15.500 --> 20:18.840
And both have styled exhaust outlets.

20:18.840 --> 20:20.560
There is one difference though.

20:20.560 --> 20:24.990
In the F-15 you don't get much sensation of speed.

20:24.990 --> 20:27.140
Where as in the Zonda...

20:27.140 --> 20:27.950
you do.

20:36.410 --> 20:38.450
The key to this car is it's engine.

20:38.450 --> 20:41.180
It was built specially for Pagani by Mercedes...

20:41.180 --> 20:43.990
and it is a masterpiece.

20:45.490 --> 20:50.010
For me, a huge chunk of a car's
appeal is the noise it makes

20:50.010 --> 20:54.880
and, the noise this one makes is just astonishing.

21:05.330 --> 21:08.720
But even better than the baritone
backdrop is that under the...

21:08.720 --> 21:11.400
super light all carbon fibre body...

21:11.400 --> 21:15.330
you have a 550 brake horsepower wallop.

21:16.020 --> 21:20.280
Not since the Germans and the Italians
teamed up in the Second World War...

21:20.280 --> 21:22.290
have we seen power like this.

21:25.190 --> 21:29.700
The top speed in fifth, is
nearly 200 miles an hour.

21:33.540 --> 21:36.940
But i'm moving out of fifth gear now...

21:36.940 --> 21:39.200
and into top gear.

21:39.700 --> 21:44.430
And now my top speed is 220 miles an hour.

22:02.010 --> 22:04.930
Whoa, a bit of twitch under braking.

22:12.260 --> 22:13.600
Whoops.

22:17.470 --> 22:21.370
This car, is an immense achievement.

22:21.370 --> 22:23.490
Plainly, it's very well made.

22:23.930 --> 22:26.470
It's astonishing to behold.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.640
I mean, really astonishing.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.590
Can't believe that, Pagani's come from nowhere

22:31.590 --> 22:32.980
and come up with this.

22:32.980 --> 22:36.380
It's a proper, proper supercar.

22:37.270 --> 22:40.530
In fact, as I see it, it only has...

22:40.530 --> 22:42.060
one problem.

22:49.670 --> 22:53.320
It must face up to the new Lamborghini Murcielago.

22:53.320 --> 22:58.360
The latest in a long line of raging
bulls from Italy's maddest supercar maker.

22:58.360 --> 23:01.480
It's the ultimate automotive pin-up.

23:02.900 --> 23:04.350
Or is it?

23:04.460 --> 23:07.970
Eveer since Audi bought Lamborghini,
i've been worried that...

23:07.970 --> 23:12.290
the Germans would try to, bring
a bit of order to the chaos.

23:12.290 --> 23:15.180
That they'd try to sanitize the madness.

23:17.720 --> 23:22.120
This is the first Lamborghini where
you don't need to have the body of...

23:22.120 --> 23:23.980
Jean Claude Van Damme to drive it.

23:23.980 --> 23:26.800
Look, you can change gear with... one finger.

23:31.890 --> 23:35.150
And the steering doesn't feel like it's set in concrete.

23:35.320 --> 23:36.880
And the clutch...

23:37.300 --> 23:41.590
The clutch, it's like... stepping on a marshmallow.

23:41.590 --> 23:45.240
However, some elements of Lambo-ness do remain.

23:45.240 --> 23:49.530
It still has the ultimate, pub
car-park accessory; gullwing doors.

23:49.530 --> 23:51.030
And check this out.

23:51.030 --> 23:55.260
When the engine gets hot, air
intakes slide out of the buttresses.

23:56.350 --> 23:57.600
Then...

23:57.600 --> 24:00.060
there's the meat; the engine.

24:00.060 --> 24:05.900
It may only be a 6.2 liter V12, the
Zonda's a 7.3 remember, but amazingly...

24:05.900 --> 24:08.300
this, is more powerful.

24:08.300 --> 24:13.820
It serves up 571 brake horsepower.

24:14.710 --> 24:15.820
So,

24:15.820 --> 24:18.720
this has more grunt...

24:18.720 --> 24:21.140
but this has less weight.

24:21.190 --> 24:23.580
So which is the fastest?

24:25.280 --> 24:41.470
Well, lets find out.

24:41.470 --> 24:44.040
Four wheel drive means that I have to...

24:44.040 --> 24:47.020
get the car rolling gently before flooring it.

24:47.020 --> 24:49.610
or I'll cook the clutch and...

24:53.510 --> 24:54.710
Into fourth.

24:55.850 --> 24:57.240
Look at that Zonda go.

24:57.240 --> 24:59.300
I'm being annihilated.

24:59.440 --> 25:00.580
150.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.500
Into fifth.

25:03.930 --> 25:05.650
And that's 160.

25:06.430 --> 25:09.330
And I have been destroyed.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.000
Destroyed!

25:17.100 --> 25:21.670
So does this mean then that
Audi has turned the raging bull...

25:21.670 --> 25:23.590
into a timid little veal?

25:25.150 --> 25:25.760
No.

25:27.020 --> 25:28.490
Not even slightly.

25:29.470 --> 25:32.980
What they've done is turn it from
a supercar into what feels like a...

25:32.980 --> 25:36.570
small, nimble, razor-sharp sports car.

25:40.080 --> 25:44.540
The old Lamborghini Diablo was like a...

25:44.540 --> 25:47.770
chest of drawers with a jet engine, but this...

25:50.110 --> 25:53.140
This you feel like the organic part of a machine.

25:56.370 --> 25:59.490
This is by far and away the best Lamborghini ever.

25:59.490 --> 26:02.920
Not just the prettiest and easiest,
but the nicest to drive.

26:02.920 --> 26:06.880
It's so good, it's better than any current Ferrari.

26:07.570 --> 26:09.020
But astonishingly...

26:09.020 --> 26:11.500
it's not as good, as the Zonda.

26:11.500 --> 26:12.720
This...

26:12.720 --> 26:15.230
is the new king of supercars.

26:15.230 --> 26:16.210
So that's it, Jeremy?

26:16.210 --> 26:19.440
You're saying that the Zonda, better
than the Lamborghini. Job done. End of story.

26:19.440 --> 26:24.340
Yes, if you're six years old and you're
looking to put a supercar on your bedroom wall...

26:24.340 --> 26:26.990
this is the one. You're going to
put this up. Not the Lambo.

26:26.990 --> 26:29.210
Yeah, small point. Six year olds buy posters.

26:29.210 --> 26:31.100
What if you're actually buying the real car?

26:31.100 --> 26:32.810
There is a bit of a price issue here.

26:32.810 --> 26:34.120
A small one, I admit.

26:33.440 --> 26:33.910
Yeah.

26:34.220 --> 26:38.260
Yes, the Lamborghini is around
160,000 pounds and this is...

26:38.260 --> 26:42.390
310,000 pounds.

26:40.280 --> 26:40.900
Right.

26:42.490 --> 26:47.270
But, in it's defense, you do get a free pair

26:47.270 --> 26:49.980
of shoes made by the Pope's cobbler with this.

26:49.980 --> 26:50.760
And...

26:51.110 --> 26:56.070
No, no you do. More than that, you
get twelve months, free membership...

26:56.070 --> 26:57.300
of the RAC.

26:57.300 --> 26:58.310
12 months?

26:58.710 --> 26:59.840
12 months free.

26:59.260 --> 27:00.970
I'm not joking. You get twelve months free...

27:00.970 --> 27:02.760
but I want to be the one that makes that call.

27:02.760 --> 27:05.870
I want to break down, M6, February, Friday night...

27:05.870 --> 27:06.700
Hello?

27:06.700 --> 27:08.740
Yes, it's my Zonda. It's gone.

27:08.740 --> 27:11.070
I think it's the engine management. You better bring a laptop.

27:12.610 --> 27:16.750
Right, well there's one final test for
this, the Zonda, and the Lambo.

27:17.040 --> 27:20.780
Now lets face it. Nowadays, 0-60 times, absolutely meaningless.

27:20.890 --> 27:23.000
Top speed figures, totally meaningless.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.340
What really matters is how fast a car can lap a test track.

27:26.850 --> 27:30.520
And fortunately, we've got our own
test track for that very purpose.

27:31.170 --> 27:32.260
So, this is it.

27:32.260 --> 27:34.570
Just under two miles of fast straights...

27:34.570 --> 27:38.150
and tricky corners designed by the test drivers at Lotus.

27:38.580 --> 27:41.560
This one, Chicago Bend is a steady state corner...

27:41.560 --> 27:43.890
that really loads up the outside tyres.

27:45.390 --> 27:46.630
Then there's Hammerhead.

27:46.630 --> 27:49.520
A tricky left and right that provokes understeer.

27:53.710 --> 27:57.180
This one, Follow Through, is supposed to be flat out...

27:57.180 --> 28:00.320
but death awaits the first man to try it.

28:00.320 --> 28:04.360
There are corners with tricky bump
and cambers designed to test brake balance.

28:05.660 --> 28:08.990
And in this one here, a badly
set up front wheel drive car

28:08.990 --> 28:11.440
will struggle to put it's power down at all.

28:15.850 --> 28:19.560
Right. That's the track. Now we
needed someone who could tame it.

28:19.560 --> 28:22.590
So, we got ourselves a professional racing driver...

28:22.590 --> 28:25.970
who could post consistently fast lap times.

28:25.970 --> 28:27.170
We, um,

28:27.170 --> 28:29.420
we couldn't do that. Now we call this thing...

28:29.420 --> 28:30.040
The Stig.

28:30.200 --> 28:31.550
Okay, we don't know it's name.

28:31.550 --> 28:33.110
We really don't know it's name.

28:33.110 --> 28:36.380
No one knows it's name and we don't want
to know cause it's a racing driver...

28:36.380 --> 28:39.270
and racing drivers have tiny little brains

28:39.270 --> 28:41.630
and therefore worthless opinions and they're very dull.

28:41.630 --> 28:44.190
Doctors actually call it Mansell Syndrome.

28:44.190 --> 28:48.440
erm... It's job is simple to
go out there and drive fast.

28:48.440 --> 28:51.200
So, first of all, we put it in the Lamborghini.

28:52.980 --> 28:54.890
Immense power as we've already discovered.

28:54.890 --> 28:57.900
You've got four wheel drive, you have
to trickle it off the line then nail it.

28:57.900 --> 28:59.830
Right, coming over that little light lift now...

28:59.830 --> 29:01.700
and he's coming through Wilson Bend.

29:01.700 --> 29:03.700
Let's see he doesn't step out of line.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.400
He's into third.

29:05.400 --> 29:09.960
Ohh, look at that, look at that.
Massive, massive oversteer right.

29:09.960 --> 29:11.310
And through the Hammerhead.

29:11.310 --> 29:13.230
No understeer at all, incredible.

29:13.230 --> 29:16.100
Big oversteer. He's trying not to
hit those tyres on the left.

29:16.100 --> 29:17.660
And he's through.

29:17.660 --> 29:19.660
So how's it handle Carpenter's Corner?

29:20.530 --> 29:22.440
This is where you really wanna nail it.

29:22.440 --> 29:24.350
Ohh look at that.

29:24.400 --> 29:27.510
Every power car that goes around
our track is gonna set a lap time...

29:27.510 --> 29:30.630
and we're gonna put those lap times
up here on out Power Lap Time Board.

29:30.630 --> 29:31.870
And the Lamborghini was...

29:31.900 --> 29:35.520
1:29, which is extremely good so
I'm gonna put that up here.

29:35.520 --> 29:38.330
Okay fine now we know the Lamborghini...

29:38.330 --> 29:41.020
Jeremy, I can't get Lamborghini Murcielago on it.

29:41.020 --> 29:43.200
A simple Lambo will perhaps suffice.

29:43.020 --> 29:45.270
L-l-la-m-b-o, there we are.

29:46.070 --> 29:46.800
Okay it's on.

29:46.560 --> 29:50.340
Now we know that the Pagani is faster
than the Lamborghini in a straight line.

29:50.340 --> 29:52.340
We've already seen that. But the Lambo

29:52.340 --> 29:55.080
I've driven it. It's faster round the corners.

29:55.080 --> 29:56.190
So,

29:56.190 --> 29:57.280
Let's put the Stig...

29:57.280 --> 29:58.220
in the Zonda...

29:58.220 --> 29:59.840
see what happens.

30:15.170 --> 30:18.820
He's coming into the first corner here,
how's it looking through there?

30:18.820 --> 30:21.400
Ooh, he's looking a bit, a bit wobbly but that's...

30:21.760 --> 30:22.870
Is he on... still on th track?

30:22.870 --> 30:25.580
Yes, he is. Now he's got to get
it right the way back across...

30:25.580 --> 30:27.090
the other side to get it...

30:28.780 --> 30:30.290
This is the hard one, this is...

30:30.290 --> 30:32.870
Yes look at that. He's really having to fight that car.

30:33.680 --> 30:35.840
Even I found it difficult through there.

30:36.340 --> 30:39.040
Now he's coming up really, really hard and fast.

30:39.040 --> 30:40.280
He's hard on the brakes here.

30:40.940 --> 30:44.220
150 miles an hour all the way down into second gear.

30:44.220 --> 30:46.580
He's actually gonna have to use first in this car.

30:46.580 --> 30:48.890
How much is the understeer through the Hammerhead corner?

30:49.480 --> 30:51.150
God he's actually managed to get some oversteer there.

30:51.150 --> 30:51.890
Good Stig.

30:51.890 --> 30:53.070
Well done, Stig.

30:54.630 --> 30:57.520
It really is quite a driver this one.

30:57.520 --> 30:59.520
Right, Follow Through. Let's listen.

31:01.280 --> 31:03.270
No, he didn't dab on the brakes there.

31:03.270 --> 31:05.910
He's got through the Follow through without following through.

31:05.910 --> 31:08.430
Fighting, God and fighting all the way up through there.

31:08.430 --> 31:10.340
Little bit on the brake though, can see.

31:10.840 --> 31:11.850
On the power.

31:11.850 --> 31:14.070
Ooh, that really is wet out there for this one.

31:14.070 --> 31:16.070
Now there's a dry bit here, oh
sorry, that's still wet.

31:16.070 --> 31:18.070
A bit damp. Brake hard.

31:18.450 --> 31:21.130
And he's into Baccarat Bend.

31:21.390 --> 31:23.820
Braking again now for Carpenter's Corner.

31:25.710 --> 31:29.040
Bit of a tailslide, but he's still
kept the power on and he's got it.

31:30.410 --> 31:33.950
Should apologise for the easy
listening soundtrack going on there.

31:33.950 --> 31:37.370
It's the Stig. It likes to listen to
the sounds of the lounge as it goes round.

31:37.370 --> 31:39.370
We've no idea why. Perhaps it calms it down.

31:39.370 --> 31:39.890
Anyway.

31:39.890 --> 31:42.190
Grim, but no need to apologise for that time.

31:42.190 --> 31:43.210
1:23.

31:43.210 --> 31:46.010
That's what? Six seconds off the Lambo's time. That's...

31:46.120 --> 31:48.960
And the incredible thing is it
must've made it up in the straights.

31:48.960 --> 31:50.770
All that time. Cause i know. I drove both cars.

31:50.770 --> 31:52.470
The Lambo's faster through the corners.

31:52.460 --> 31:54.000
That's where it has the power. 1:23.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.280
I honestly can't see that being beaten...

31:56.620 --> 31:57.810
throughout the entire series.

31:57.810 --> 31:58.500
I think we've peaked.

31:58.410 --> 31:59.470
Neither can I. But...

31:59.470 --> 32:01.720
If you think you've got a car which is faster than that.

32:01.720 --> 32:03.320
Perhaps you've tuned it.

32:03.320 --> 32:04.850
Implausible I know. But, there you go.

32:04.850 --> 32:06.990
If you think you have , why don't you get in touch.

32:06.990 --> 32:09.280
You can either use text messaging.

32:09.280 --> 32:11.620
Which you have to have a cellular telephone for.

32:11.620 --> 32:13.620
Or write to us using a quill.

32:13.620 --> 32:15.030
Or go on an internet.

32:15.710 --> 32:16.190
Right.

32:16.720 --> 32:18.400
There is a story going round

32:18.400 --> 32:20.730
that says if a car goes fast enough

32:20.730 --> 32:22.250
past a speed camera,

32:22.250 --> 32:25.270
when the second flash goes off and
it needs that to verify the speed...

32:25.270 --> 32:27.650
the car won't be there. It's going so fast...

32:27.650 --> 32:30.100
it will have left the shot entirely.

32:30.100 --> 32:32.140
So in the name of scientific endeavour...

32:32.140 --> 32:33.960
and under controlled circumstances...

32:33.960 --> 32:35.960
we had a go, so that you don't have to.

32:37.250 --> 32:40.090
WE've got together everything we need to do this.

32:40.090 --> 32:42.640
A piece of track. Straight, obviously.

32:44.590 --> 32:45.960
We've got a speed camera.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.590
OH, and a really fast car.

32:49.590 --> 32:51.260
And the Stig, to drive it.

33:04.500 --> 33:05.910
Honda Civic Type R.

33:05.910 --> 33:07.600
Lots of people have got these.

33:07.600 --> 33:10.600
It'll hit 60 miles and hour in 7.2 seconds and

33:10.280 --> 33:14.530
and go on to a stop speed of 146 miles an hour.

33:14.530 --> 33:17.040
But will that be enough to be the camera?

33:28.810 --> 33:29.880
So how fast was that?

33:29.880 --> 33:33.240
Well, i've got the pictures back.
It was 129 miles an hour.

33:33.240 --> 33:35.430
And, uh, here's the results of the first flash.

33:35.430 --> 33:38.080
And there's a Honda Civic doing 129 miles an hour.

33:35.430 --> 33:36.030
Yup.

33:38.050 --> 33:40.680
and... then the second photograph.

33:38.080 --> 33:38.860
Plainly in shot.

33:40.880 --> 33:41.330
ah...

33:41.670 --> 33:42.120
it's...

33:42.320 --> 33:43.120
Still there.

33:42.320 --> 33:45.180
Still, there, so 129 isn't fast enough.

33:45.180 --> 33:46.480
That won't do. But we didn't give up.

33:46.480 --> 33:48.480
We had another go, and we'll do that later on.

33:48.590 --> 33:49.150
Good.

33:53.290 --> 33:57.510
When most comedians-cum-actors make it
to the big time, they buy themselves...

33:57.510 --> 33:59.320
a big type car.

33:59.320 --> 34:02.320
Rowan Atkinson for instance bought himself a McLaren F1.

34:02.320 --> 34:04.710
Steve Coogan, a Ferrari 355.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.550
Norman Wisdom,

34:06.550 --> 34:07.480
oh well, forget that one.

34:07.480 --> 34:11.540
Anyway, our guest tonight, when he
made it to the big time, he bought...

34:11.540 --> 34:13.540
one of these. Are we ready?

34:13.540 --> 34:15.000
Right. Here we go.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.830
Look at that.

34:16.830 --> 34:18.510
It is, a

34:18.510 --> 34:23.610
Vauxhall Cavalier Convertible.

34:23.610 --> 34:26.420
Plainly this guy was devoted to making people laugh...

34:27.469 --> 34:29.310
even when he was on his way to the supermarket.

34:29.719 --> 34:30.489
Shall we meet him?

34:31.120 --> 34:31.880
Ladies and gentlemen...

34:31.900 --> 34:33.050
Harry Enfield.

34:43.659 --> 34:47.600
What in God's name possessed you to buy one of those?

34:47.750 --> 34:51.429
It's actually a lovely car. Very
reliable motor, the Cavalier.

34:51.429 --> 34:55.889
But I did feel like, bit of a... you know,
because i'd sort of become slightly famous and...

34:55.889 --> 34:57.890
you find yourself... It's the only convertible i've had...

34:58.450 --> 35:01.240
At the lights, in the middle of London,
cause i've always lived in London.

35:01.440 --> 35:03.950
You're sort of in the lights,
and you got the roof down.

35:03.950 --> 35:07.510
And, uh, people crossing the road in front of you,
may look in, may see you, and say,"ooh yeah"...

35:07.510 --> 35:10.340
*laughter*

35:14.780 --> 35:17.170
And you're just stuck there cause the light's red.

35:19.720 --> 35:20.880
Now, look...

35:20.880 --> 35:22.190
Here, there's a magazine...

35:22.190 --> 35:24.090
The, uh, Convertible Correspondence

35:24.090 --> 35:28.240
The... Vauxhall Cavalier Convertible owner's club

35:28.500 --> 35:30.520
You were, i know, you... you appeared in this.

35:30.520 --> 35:33.100
And this is my favourite bit. Under famous owners.

35:33.680 --> 35:35.310
An occasional feature.

35:35.310 --> 35:37.330
They haven't been able to find anyone since you got one

35:37.330 --> 35:40.970
and you said, it was like.. it was better than a BMW.

35:40.970 --> 35:41.950
-Yeah.

35:40.970 --> 35:41.950
-Did I?

35:41.950 --> 35:43.270
Well, I think it is.

35:43.290 --> 35:45.240
Better than a BMW.

35:45.240 --> 35:46.540
Fine han... yeah.

35:46.540 --> 35:49.000
Which bit of it did you think was better than a BMW?

35:49.000 --> 35:50.220
Well, I think I thought it...

35:50.220 --> 35:52.280
The price was better than a BMW.

35:53.160 --> 35:54.120
Fair point.

35:54.120 --> 35:55.650
Interestingly, um...

35:55.650 --> 35:59.500
when you decided... that it was time to part with the...

35:59.500 --> 36:01.850
um... Vauxhall Cavalier Convertible.

36:01.850 --> 36:03.850
You were getting even more famous at the time.

36:03.850 --> 36:05.420
You went backwards...

36:05.420 --> 36:07.720
...and bought a Rover 200.

36:07.720 --> 36:08.790
Yes, yes I did.

36:08.790 --> 36:12.630
Again, what in God's name possessed you to do that?

36:12.630 --> 36:15.850
Because, most work in our industry is done in Soho...

36:15.850 --> 36:18.100
and there is a shop in Soho that sells...

36:18.100 --> 36:18.850
Rovers.

36:19.200 --> 36:21.220
So, I went in there and... and bought the Rover.

36:21.220 --> 36:22.610
Forgive me, Soho?

36:22.610 --> 36:24.610
It's close to Park Lane, on which...

36:24.610 --> 36:26.980
by memory there's Aston Martin, Jaguar...

36:27.460 --> 36:29.270
BMW, Lexus, McLaren...

36:29.690 --> 36:31.510
Masera... and so forth.

36:29.690 --> 36:30.480
Right.

36:31.670 --> 36:32.150
Right

36:32.150 --> 36:34.010
You could've gone to anyone of those shops.

36:34.240 --> 36:35.480
Not to the Rover one...

36:35.480 --> 36:36.540
and bought a Rover 200...

36:36.540 --> 36:38.360
which wasn't...

36:36.540 --> 36:38.360
But the Rover were in Soho...

36:38.360 --> 36:40.860
and they're about half a mile
away. And you know then...

36:40.860 --> 36:44.250
So, is this why you swapped the Rover for a Metro?

36:44.250 --> 36:45.650
Yeah, same place.

36:46.350 --> 36:47.850
When you go round to say...

36:47.850 --> 36:49.850
see Rowan Atkinson or see whoever

36:49.850 --> 36:51.250
at the time in your Cavalier

36:49.800 --> 36:50.390
Yeah...

36:51.250 --> 36:52.390
or your Metro or your Rover...

36:53.050 --> 36:54.750
Did, they say,"Harry..."

36:54.750 --> 36:56.560
Take you on one side? Try to give you some advice.

36:56.560 --> 36:59.320
No, i'm afraid, but, in fact,
it did actually happen once...

36:59.320 --> 37:00.670
though I never talk about, sort of...

37:00.950 --> 37:02.160
thing of it, but I do have a...

37:02.510 --> 37:04.000
abiding memory in my head of...

37:04.710 --> 37:06.830
driving round someone's... house.

37:08.380 --> 37:11.280
It sounds very showbiz-y, but this
is the only time it's ever happened...

37:11.280 --> 37:13.490
and Robbie Coltrane was there and
Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie...

37:13.490 --> 37:15.020
and they all had nice cars.

37:15.020 --> 37:17.020
And I arrived in my Cavalier

37:18.210 --> 37:20.140
And they were all outside, it was a nice day and they

37:20.140 --> 37:22.140
were all talking about each other's cars and...

37:22.670 --> 37:24.970
and they looked at me, and I looked at them.

37:25.470 --> 37:26.870
And no one ever mentioned it.

37:26.870 --> 37:28.380
Just no one ever mentioned it.

37:28.700 --> 37:31.300
No one ever mentioned the car, none of them, ever.

37:28.400 --> 37:29.520
There's nothing you can say.

37:31.700 --> 37:33.190
Anyway, what have you got now?

37:33.190 --> 37:35.190
Lexu... umm, now we've got a...

37:35.190 --> 37:37.190
a Mercedes estate, yes.

37:37.640 --> 37:39.270
Very nice.

37:37.640 --> 37:39.270
Very nice.

37:39.250 --> 37:40.130
It's very small.

37:40.130 --> 37:40.710
And?

37:40.710 --> 37:43.240
It's too small... And now my wife's got a Mini.

37:43.490 --> 37:44.190
Very good.

37:44.190 --> 37:45.290
Have you seen this?

37:46.000 --> 37:48.840
Yes, um, I want that car, it's called a volvo

37:49.210 --> 37:50.650
I want that car.

37:49.610 --> 37:50.700
It's got seven...

37:50.830 --> 37:52.210
seats, and...

37:52.350 --> 37:54.210
Oh there's a picture, look it's on the screen.

37:52.370 --> 37:54.230
Oh, look, that's...

37:54.230 --> 37:57.800
the volvo, cause i'm not allowed to
drive, because my wife, likes to drive.

37:58.240 --> 38:00.240
So, i have to sit in the, other thing and I...

38:00.660 --> 38:02.310
at the moment I sit in our...

38:02.310 --> 38:04.000
car like this with an airbag here.

38:04.050 --> 38:06.250
This one... looks very big.

38:06.600 --> 38:06.950
mmm...

38:06.950 --> 38:08.650
I either want this or the BMW one...

38:08.650 --> 38:10.290
which we tried out, it's fantastic.

38:10.290 --> 38:10.810
No you don't.

38:10.830 --> 38:12.430
It's great it's fantastic.

38:11.530 --> 38:13.290
I assure you, you don't want...

38:12.480 --> 38:14.040
And it's the ideal car...

38:14.060 --> 38:17.190
for my wife to drive cause she's got
blonde hair and we live in Notting Hill.

38:17.190 --> 38:20.120
And that's the car... people drive.

38:18.170 --> 38:19.120
mmhmm...

38:20.120 --> 38:21.350
You're not just here to chat today.

38:21.350 --> 38:22.950
-No, no.

38:21.350 --> 38:22.950
-Aren't I?

38:22.950 --> 38:24.950
Because earlier today, erm...

38:25.530 --> 38:26.880
We had you doing some...

38:27.090 --> 38:27.760
Oh, yeah.

38:27.760 --> 38:29.520
Absolutely. You see the thing is, every week...

38:29.520 --> 38:31.380
we are gonna run an item called...

38:31.380 --> 38:33.380
A Star in a Reasonably Price Car.

38:33.380 --> 38:35.560
We got the star, obviously, what we then needed...

38:35.860 --> 38:37.560
was a reasonably priced car.

38:37.560 --> 38:39.560
Now we talked to Hyundai... they said no.

38:40.420 --> 38:42.130
We talked to Nissan, they said no.

38:42.130 --> 38:43.600
We talked to Daewoo, they said no

38:43.600 --> 38:45.570
Then we talked to Suzuki, and they said...

38:45.570 --> 38:47.500
sure, have a Liana.

38:47.500 --> 38:51.050
9,995 pounds... on the road.

38:51.080 --> 38:52.870
In fact it's over there. There it is.

38:52.870 --> 38:54.870
and what a beauty it is.

38:54.870 --> 38:56.870
The most beautiful car...

38:56.870 --> 38:58.020
I've ever seen.

38:58.020 --> 38:58.760
And what we're...

38:58.760 --> 39:00.360
in the world.

38:58.760 --> 39:00.360
in... in the...

39:00.360 --> 39:01.520
Absolutely.

39:01.520 --> 39:03.240
And the idea is, is that every week...

39:03.240 --> 39:06.010
our star, will take that round our test track...

39:06.010 --> 39:08.510
see how fast he or she can do it.

39:08.510 --> 39:10.510
And then we'll post that time on a board...

39:10.510 --> 39:12.510
and at the end of the series, we'll be able to name...

39:12.690 --> 39:14.130
Britain's fastest celebrity.

39:14.130 --> 39:16.390
Trouble is, of course, err, we
weren't gonna let you out...

39:16.390 --> 39:18.390
without going out first of all, I had to try it

39:18.390 --> 39:21.010
with the other guys and, uh, this is what happened.

39:23.420 --> 39:24.700
GO!

39:24.700 --> 39:26.350
Ooh, my Lord, there's...

39:26.350 --> 39:28.930
God, look at the speed, we're doing 37 before we...

39:29.090 --> 39:30.420
34 miles an hour.

39:30.420 --> 39:32.230
Now, looks at this, look at this, it's going well.

39:32.230 --> 39:34.780
I once drove a supertanker...

39:34.780 --> 39:36.110
that was a bit like this.

39:37.170 --> 39:38.920
We're going off, were going off...

39:38.920 --> 39:41.140
We're off... we're off the track and...

39:41.100 --> 39:42.840
Little bit of track with us there.

39:42.960 --> 39:46.210
How much is a paintjob?

39:46.210 --> 39:48.210
Anyway, we got the tracking fixed...

39:48.210 --> 39:49.780
and the gearbox.

39:49.780 --> 39:52.380
And I posted a time, even with...

39:52.380 --> 39:55.220
big Jason in the back, of 1:50.

39:55.990 --> 39:59.120
erm... now, we're currently cutting you lap...

39:59.120 --> 40:00.910
in the edit suite, we'll be showing it later.

40:00.910 --> 40:02.970
How fast do you think you might've gone?

40:02.970 --> 40:03.900
I don't know.

40:03.900 --> 40:04.670
You don't know?

40:04.180 --> 40:05.620
But it was very fast.

40:05.620 --> 40:06.690
-Yeah.

40:05.620 --> 40:06.690
-Was it?

40:06.710 --> 40:08.320
But I can't remember what comes next. Oh I know...

40:08.320 --> 40:11.170
We're gonna see if we can get that car
to go through a speed camera.

40:11.890 --> 40:13.240
We're gonna try and beat a speed camera.

40:12.890 --> 40:14.790
So do you want me to stay here or go?

40:14.790 --> 40:16.600
No, have a seat, roll your sleeves up.

40:16.050 --> 40:16.600
Great.

40:16.600 --> 40:18.090
Would you like a drink?

40:18.090 --> 40:18.830
Yeah.

40:19.040 --> 40:19.670
Chill.

40:19.860 --> 40:22.020
Earlier on, in the name of scientific endeavour...

40:22.020 --> 40:25.920
we tried to see if it was possible to
go fast enough to be a speed camera.

40:25.920 --> 40:28.940
We used a Honda Civic Type R.
It did 129 miles an hour...

40:28.940 --> 40:31.080
and it was still there for the second flash.

40:31.080 --> 40:33.120
You might think this thing
would be the one to do it in...

40:33.300 --> 40:34.680
it wouldn't. It's only a pretend model.

40:34.680 --> 40:37.780
20 miles an hour, tops. So, we got hold of a faster car.

40:39.180 --> 40:39.780
Right then.

40:39.780 --> 40:43.410
This should be worth a go, the Mercedes CL 55 AMG.

40:43.410 --> 40:46.980
At 89,000 not only does it cost as much as a house...

40:46.980 --> 40:48.660
it's nearly as big as one.

40:48.660 --> 40:52.350
But it'll still do 60 miles an hour in 4.7 seconds...

40:52.350 --> 40:56.940
and it'll cruise all day at 155
as easily as your car will do 30.

40:56.940 --> 40:58.970
But will that be enough? Let's find out.

40:58.970 --> 40:59.710
Go on then.

41:16.990 --> 41:18.540
Well, we've got the pictures back.

41:18.540 --> 41:21.050
And here they are, 148 miles an hour...

41:21.050 --> 41:22.400
and, oh dear.

41:22.400 --> 41:24.320
There he is in the first one, and...

41:24.320 --> 41:25.420
still there in the second one.

41:25.460 --> 41:26.970
That isn't fast enough.

41:26.970 --> 41:30.270
We're gonna have to try and go
even faster. And we're gonna do that...

41:30.570 --> 41:35.220
Okay, so far in the program we've shown
you how to save money on a family hatchback...

41:35.220 --> 41:37.560
we're trying to save you some money on speeding fines...

41:37.560 --> 41:40.510
by showing you that if you speed up you can get round them.

41:40.510 --> 41:45.230
And now we're gonna give you the
biggest money saving tip, of them all.

41:45.230 --> 41:49.060
There's been a lot of talk in the newspaper and on the radio these past couple of weeks...

41:49.060 --> 41:52.660
about people running their cars, their diesel engined cars I should say...

41:52.660 --> 41:53.730
on vegetable oil.

41:53.730 --> 41:55.720
There's been so many people trying it...

41:55.720 --> 41:57.720
that up north, one supermarket train...

41:57.910 --> 41:59.810
err, chain, is now rationing...

41:59.810 --> 42:02.200
the amount of oil, that it will sell...

42:02.200 --> 42:03.920
to individuals.

42:03.920 --> 42:07.180
erm... Now the thing is, is that you can run a car...

42:07.180 --> 42:08.580
on vegetable oil.

42:08.580 --> 42:10.450
It's not completely brilliant.

42:10.450 --> 42:12.200
However, i've been joined, here...

42:12.200 --> 42:13.100
by Jason Taylor.

42:13.100 --> 42:16.680
You reckon you've got a little additive
that makes the whole thing better, yeah?

42:16.680 --> 42:20.120
So, what we've got here is some, normal vegetable oil?

42:16.680 --> 42:17.020
Yeah.

42:20.120 --> 42:23.030
That's used vegetable oil from a mexican restaurant.

42:23.030 --> 42:24.220
-Used, yeah.

42:23.030 --> 42:24.220
-Used?

42:24.710 --> 42:25.510
Why used?

42:25.570 --> 42:29.000
Well, we find it gives it a bit
of better power to the engine.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.270
Really? there's all these bits so

42:30.270 --> 42:32.490
we have to strain those out obviously.

42:32.600 --> 42:33.720
Put that over here.

42:33.720 --> 42:35.740
one of these Jay cloths, okay?

42:35.740 --> 42:37.400
And in we go.

42:37.400 --> 42:39.400
So that'll collect the bits.

42:39.400 --> 42:40.460
Look at that.

42:40.870 --> 42:42.310
and you reckon this'll work?

42:42.310 --> 42:44.720
Yeah it's like golden elixir that stuff.

42:46.150 --> 42:47.500
Does it make the car smell a bit?

42:47.500 --> 42:51.080
It, er, it is actually... the different
restaurants, you can tell what you're running it on.

42:52.200 --> 42:53.250
-Yeah.

42:52.200 --> 42:53.250
-Seriously?

42:53.920 --> 42:57.480
So, if we run a car on this, it's gonna
smell... essence of where it came from?

42:57.480 --> 42:58.080
Yeah.

42:58.080 --> 42:59.950
Okay, that's in there like that. Fine.

42:59.950 --> 43:01.950
Now, what have you worked out you have to add to that?

43:01.950 --> 43:04.650
Right, well just to make it a bit, a bit...

43:04.650 --> 43:06.180
more runnier, you add...

43:06.180 --> 43:06.980
err... a solvent.

43:06.980 --> 43:10.360
And for this experiment, we've got
a non-kerosene based white spirit.

43:10.490 --> 43:13.720
It has to be non-kerosene based for tax reasons.

43:10.490 --> 43:11.090
Okay.

43:13.740 --> 43:15.400
Okay, and how much do we have to put it?

43:15.400 --> 43:20.030
err... In, in a liter, in 97ml of...

43:20.030 --> 43:23.590
err, vegetable oil, you put 3ml of that in there.

43:23.590 --> 43:25.960
so that's about that much? Okay, let's put that in there.

43:24.660 --> 43:25.290
mmhmm.

43:27.180 --> 43:29.210
Okay? So we add that.

43:29.620 --> 43:32.310
Okay? And then we, uh, whisk it up.

43:32.680 --> 43:35.890
Well, actually, you don't really
need to risk, err, whisk it, but...

43:35.890 --> 43:36.940
So is that ready to go now?

43:36.940 --> 43:40.240
That's ready to... Well no, you
should let it stand for at least...

43:40.240 --> 43:41.230
a week or so.

43:41.230 --> 43:43.230
And how much does that cost?

43:43.230 --> 43:44.090
For a liter?

43:44.090 --> 43:46.230
About 3 pence, plus the tax.

43:46.230 --> 43:47.690
Oh, you have to pay tax?

43:47.690 --> 43:51.420
If you didn't tell the Excise & Customs,
that's 3p, if you do tell them...

43:51.480 --> 43:52.710
You have to tell them.

43:52.710 --> 43:55.010
Okay, ye... of course, you have to tell them.

43:55.120 --> 43:56.590
You have to tell them.

43:56.590 --> 43:59.190
Right. And... how much are they gonna charge.

43:59.190 --> 44:03.570
err, 26 pence, but check with your
local Customs & Excise office.

44:03.570 --> 44:06.910
That's about 29p a liter. You've
got to fill a couple of forms in.

44:06.910 --> 44:08.610
29p a liter.

44:08.610 --> 44:10.760
Just run through, do you have to modify the engine.

44:10.760 --> 44:11.320
No.

44:11.320 --> 44:12.680
Just any old diesel will do?

44:12.680 --> 44:13.090
Yeah.

44:13.090 --> 44:14.060
And you can... and it's fine?

44:14.060 --> 44:14.380
Yeah.

44:14.380 --> 44:15.090
Performance?

44:15.720 --> 44:17.890
The same as diesel, maybe even better.

44:17.890 --> 44:20.760
And you reckon we could tip that
into a diesel car and it would work?

44:20.760 --> 44:21.190
Yeah.

44:22.520 --> 44:23.860
Gotta give that a go, haven't we?

44:24.720 --> 44:27.520
This is a Volvo 740.

44:27.520 --> 44:30.620
In the front there's a diesel
engine, and in the tank in the back...

44:30.620 --> 44:32.170
nothing. It's empty. Listen.

44:33.010 --> 44:33.960
Start the engine.

44:35.660 --> 44:37.770
Can't start the engine. No fuel.

44:37.770 --> 44:39.240
And we can verify that. Look.

44:39.240 --> 44:41.720
Here we have an independent adjudicator...

44:41.720 --> 44:43.960
Bal, you'll verify there's nothing in there?

44:43.960 --> 44:47.170
Nothing in the tank. We've drained
off 25 liters, it's completely empty now.

44:47.170 --> 44:49.170
Right. Brilliant. Well, if we go round the back...

44:49.170 --> 44:50.480
and look in the boot.

44:51.580 --> 44:52.530
We find...

44:53.070 --> 44:54.210
a big container...

44:54.320 --> 44:57.850
full of vegetable oil, from El Rio's in Macclesfield.

44:58.130 --> 45:00.930
Now, we've added a splash of white spirit and, Bal...

45:00.930 --> 45:02.930
is going to pour, that...

45:03.340 --> 45:04.400
into the tank.

45:06.940 --> 45:10.880
Right. Now, it's been converted
from a carnivore, into a herbivore.

45:10.880 --> 45:13.600
But of course, being a diesel, you
can't just start it. You have to...

45:13.600 --> 45:15.880
bleed the system first, which you've just done, yes, Bal?

45:16.890 --> 45:17.840
System bled?

45:17.840 --> 45:21.160
No airlocks in there? good, lets close the bonnet.

45:21.160 --> 45:23.030
If you wanna step in.

45:23.030 --> 45:24.780
And lets see if it starts.

45:24.780 --> 45:26.780
If it does, I shall be astonished.

45:32.660 --> 45:34.730
That's amazing.

45:34.730 --> 45:35.960
Go! Go!

45:40.180 --> 45:43.050
One pound fifty a gallon and it's working.

45:43.050 --> 45:43.690
Wow.

45:43.690 --> 45:45.690
It's actually, I mean, still going round out there.

45:44.880 --> 45:45.870
And is it, is it...

45:45.870 --> 45:46.770
green?

45:47.200 --> 45:49.850
Environmental? Oh, apparently so, yeah.

45:47.200 --> 45:49.850
So, that, you know... yeah.

45:49.850 --> 45:50.630
Wow.

45:50.630 --> 45:53.320
Anyway, Harry, big news, your lap has been edited.

45:53.320 --> 45:54.050
Do you wanna have a look?

45:54.050 --> 45:54.830
Yes please.

45:54.310 --> 45:55.820
Who'd like to see Harry's lap?

45:57.240 --> 45:58.530
Okay, here we go.

45:58.810 --> 46:00.210
hope I don't die.

46:00.260 --> 46:01.010
Ready, steady, go.

46:02.690 --> 46:03.830
It might skid.

46:04.440 --> 46:06.330
Up on 30 miles an hour.

46:06.740 --> 46:08.900
now I'm going... at 40 miles an hour.

46:09.590 --> 46:10.990
50 miles an...

46:10.990 --> 46:11.630
Blimey.

46:13.810 --> 46:16.970
There, oh yeah. That's supposed to be, take that down...

46:16.970 --> 46:18.700
wahey... And...

46:18.700 --> 46:20.310
nicely controlled.

46:25.700 --> 46:28.260
Little foot on the brake, little tidy bit...

46:28.260 --> 46:29.830
and, into second.

46:29.830 --> 46:31.280
Lovely.

46:31.280 --> 46:33.450
Take it round into second.

46:38.540 --> 46:41.980
Yes, i can feel some kind of braking thing happening there.

46:43.320 --> 46:44.980
Me braking the car.

46:50.920 --> 46:52.760
And... oh, yes, whoa...

46:52.760 --> 46:54.650
Hey, I lost control of that.

46:55.380 --> 46:57.060
Nice. That was fun.

47:05.770 --> 47:07.580
And the winner...

47:08.240 --> 47:09.790
in a race of one.

47:13.110 --> 47:15.460
And there are a couple of things I gotta bring up on that.

47:15.460 --> 47:18.820
On one of the corners, I think it was Baccarat Bend there...

47:19.380 --> 47:20.760
the tail was out.

47:20.760 --> 47:23.240
You're a bit of a hypocrite, you came off the bloody circuit.

47:23.240 --> 47:24.570
I know, I'm saying.

47:24.570 --> 47:25.800
This is praise.

47:25.800 --> 47:26.680
Oh, this is a good thing?

47:26.680 --> 47:27.780
It's a good thing.

47:28.640 --> 47:30.580
It's a good thing. I mean, here I was...

47:30.580 --> 47:34.290
Cavalier convertible, Metro, Rover 200. I assumed...

47:34.290 --> 47:35.730
Father of three.

47:34.290 --> 47:35.730
Yeah.

47:35.730 --> 47:38.530
I assumed that you'd be useless.

47:38.660 --> 47:39.480
Well I was useless.

47:39.500 --> 47:41.570
But it's a very nice car because...

47:39.500 --> 47:41.570
No, but you weren't.

47:41.570 --> 47:43.360
put your foot on the brake and it...

47:43.360 --> 47:45.360
it doesn't skid really. It goes dh-dh-dh-dh-dh...

47:45.420 --> 47:48.030
It's got that, APS braking thing.

47:48.030 --> 47:50.530
Clearly, that'll do, yes.

47:48.940 --> 47:50.230
So you go...

47:50.440 --> 47:52.620
in third, because it doesn't really go in fourth...

47:52.660 --> 47:56.020
But, it's very nice. That's what I call a proper A-B car.

47:56.020 --> 47:57.400
Wanna know how fast it was?

47:57.400 --> 47:58.840
I reckon... should i guess?

47:58.840 --> 48:01.040
That was 1:48, I was 1:50.

48:02.180 --> 48:03.050
1:47.

48:05.030 --> 48:07.180
I've got some disappointing news for you.

48:07.180 --> 48:08.150
Oh no.

48:08.150 --> 48:09.400
Enfield...

48:09.400 --> 48:11.470
I'll just put you up here. you're the very first...

48:11.470 --> 48:13.790
star, in a reasonably priced car.

48:14.200 --> 48:15.790
Enfield...

48:16.080 --> 48:18.640
2:01.

48:19.350 --> 48:21.770
And that's only eleven seconds off the pace and...

48:21.770 --> 48:22.930
that's not bad.

48:21.770 --> 48:22.930
That's not bad.

48:22.930 --> 48:24.260
I've been driving around there all day.

48:24.260 --> 48:25.990
Yeah, you get... put your... there.

48:27.020 --> 48:29.520
Ladies and gentlemen, Harry Enfield.

48:41.650 --> 48:44.490
Right. time now for some insider dealing.

48:44.490 --> 48:45.980
Jason, what've you got for us this week.

48:45.980 --> 48:48.240
Well, first of all the Mini. So, great news for Harry...

48:48.240 --> 48:50.720
at last, after his appalling and rather bad luck with cars...

48:50.720 --> 48:52.200
he's bought one, that's good news.

48:52.310 --> 48:55.500
erm... The car's been our for about
12 months now and the first of those cars...

48:55.500 --> 48:57.960
are actually starting to be listed
in Glass's Guide and CAP.

48:57.960 --> 49:01.270
And incredibly, the basic model,
the Mini One, which is this one...

49:01.270 --> 49:03.880
err, was just on 10,000 pounds when it was new.

49:03.880 --> 49:07.370
Today that car, as a used car, is worth 10,500.

49:07.930 --> 49:08.620
So you could ru...

49:09.010 --> 49:10.620
You could run on for a year?

49:10.620 --> 49:15.060
10,000 miles, and sell it
for more than you paid for?

49:11.420 --> 49:11.700
Yep.

49:13.360 --> 49:15.060
And make your profit, 500 pounds.

49:15.150 --> 49:18.270
I mean that sometimes happens with
expensive cars, isn't it? Ferraris and Porsches.

49:18.310 --> 49:21.370
Yeah... but, something this cheap,
I mean, just, doesn't happen.

49:21.800 --> 49:23.070
That's astonishing.

49:23.250 --> 49:24.670
think how sick I'm feeling.

49:25.180 --> 49:26.760
Should've bought a whole... dozen of them.

49:26.760 --> 49:28.800
I mean the problem is... after...
is... they've... just... is...

49:28.800 --> 49:30.570
The same thing is happening in America, they've just...

49:30.050 --> 49:30.550
Yeah.

49:30.610 --> 49:33.000
shipped 20,000 over there. They've sold that in...

49:33.000 --> 49:34.770
well, 15 minutes, I mean, you know?

49:34.770 --> 49:36.130
Ridiculous. All gone. Yeah

49:34.750 --> 49:35.070
Gone?

49:36.540 --> 49:38.220
So, wh... it really has been a success.

49:38.220 --> 49:40.240
-Well Subaru...

49:38.220 --> 49:40.240
-What else is there?

49:40.240 --> 49:42.460
Everyone knows the Impreza Turbo, um...

49:42.460 --> 49:45.300
when the car first came out,
it was a great looking car.

49:45.300 --> 49:47.650
But that's the one we remember
unfortunately, the ugly basta...

49:47.650 --> 49:49.650
-That's the one we've got now.

49:47.650 --> 49:49.650
-That's the one we've got now?

49:49.650 --> 49:52.070
But that car's only been out, for just under 3 years.

49:52.070 --> 49:56.180
But it's been doing so badly that Subaru
realised they had to change the way the thing looks.

49:56.180 --> 49:58.770
They've actually got a facelift coming 
out in February of next year.

49:58.770 --> 49:59.720
Which everybody knows about.

49:59.720 --> 50:02.800
Everybody knows about. The problem they've
got, is that they've got stacks of these.

50:03.120 --> 50:05.210
So they're gonna do something about it.
And what they're doing is they're taking...

50:05.210 --> 50:08.250
3,000. 3,000 of the price of these cars.

50:08.400 --> 50:09.340
So how much is it now?

50:09.340 --> 50:12.980
18,995. You can buy a brand new Subaru Turbo...

50:12.980 --> 50:14.040
-Yeah.

50:12.980 --> 50:14.040
-Seriously , they will do that?

50:14.080 --> 50:16.090
You walk in, you just go,"I want 3,000 of that."

50:16.090 --> 50:16.930
They go," Certainly, sir."

50:16.930 --> 50:20.270
They've dropped it by 3,000. That's
before you do any discount and negotiation.

50:20.430 --> 50:23.710
The most you'll pay for one is 18,995.

50:20.430 --> 50:21.340
Well, there's still some...

50:23.710 --> 50:25.070
And then there'll be a new pretty...

50:25.070 --> 50:27.720
I mean, you could just buy that,
kick it in the headlights and make it look

50:27.720 --> 50:31.140
better anyway... and then you...

50:31.490 --> 50:32.880
Good news if you wanna buy a new one.

50:32.880 --> 50:35.060
They are so cheap. But the problem is...

50:35.060 --> 50:36.740
that when something new drops in price...

50:36.740 --> 50:38.870
you've got to reflect that in
the used car values as well.

50:38.870 --> 50:41.280
Yeah, but I haven't got a used Subaru, so why do I care?

50:41.280 --> 50:43.590
Because if you were gonna buy a
used Subaru, you shouldn't.

50:43.590 --> 50:45.240
You should wait for a couple of months

50:45.240 --> 50:47.240
Wait for these to flood the market, and you'll save yourself...

50:47.240 --> 50:48.990
another couple of grand on a used one.

50:49.580 --> 50:50.880
Brilliant. What else?

50:50.880 --> 50:52.020
XC90.

50:52.020 --> 50:54.320
The SUV. The ne... the new Volvo SUV.

50:52.020 --> 50:54.320
Yeah... Yeah...

50:54.320 --> 50:56.820
It's coming to the UK in about November time.

50:57.200 --> 50:59.360
Volvo have made a major error with this car...

50:59.360 --> 51:00.880
because the car is just so good.

51:01.440 --> 51:03.490
But they're only gonna make 3,500.

51:03.490 --> 51:03.910
Yeah.

51:03.910 --> 51:05.780
3,500 for the UK for the whole year.

51:05.780 --> 51:07.940
Now if you divide that by 220 dealers...

51:07.900 --> 51:08.270
Yeah?

51:08.270 --> 51:10.890
It works out at about one car per dealer per month.

51:11.150 --> 51:12.380
Which is nowhere near enough.

51:12.340 --> 51:13.640
Which is nowhere near enough.

51:13.640 --> 51:16.300
I was talking to someone from Volvo
the other day, and he said well...

51:16.300 --> 51:17.740
I think we're only gonna make 50,000.

51:17.740 --> 51:19.490
And I just thought, I can't believe that, cause...

51:19.490 --> 51:22.410
they've got a Volvo. Pretty Popular. Make it an offroad car.

51:22.410 --> 51:23.810
Well, sort of offroad car.

51:23.810 --> 51:25.300
And that's really doubly popular...

51:25.300 --> 51:27.340
and then they're gonna put seven seats in it, three rows.

51:27.340 --> 51:29.430
Still space behind for a... labrador.

51:29.870 --> 51:31.070
Or any other sort of sloaney dog.

51:31.490 --> 51:32.820
And then they've got TVs in the back.

51:32.820 --> 51:34.630
They've got sep'arate hifi so you can listen to the

51:34.630 --> 51:38.320
tapes in the... little seats and stereo
and err... radio in the front.

51:38.490 --> 51:40.790
And the they said," Mmh, don't think
we're gonna sell many of those."

51:40.790 --> 51:44.040
Even though it's 12,000 pounds less than an X5.

51:44.040 --> 51:44.780
Potty.

51:44.780 --> 51:47.350
So, Harry, hang onto your Mini and buy a Volvo...

51:47.350 --> 51:50.300
and you can save so much money
you can buy the Cavalier back.

51:52.440 --> 51:54.210
Mazda have made precisely...

51:54.210 --> 51:56.270
two interesting cars in recent years.

51:56.270 --> 51:58.270
The MX-5 which is a sports car for...

51:58.270 --> 51:59.940
girls and blokes who like ABBA.

51:59.940 --> 52:02.380
And the RX-7, which was good, but a bit daft.

52:02.380 --> 52:04.940
So news of a new Mazda sports saloon...

52:05.610 --> 52:09.770
It's hardly gonna excite anyone
outside of the Findlay Green Bowls Club.

52:09.770 --> 52:10.250
Is it?

52:30.090 --> 52:33.690
People don't buy Mazdas, because they desperately want

52:33.690 --> 52:35.770
a Mazda. They buy them because...

52:35.770 --> 52:38.380
well, unfortunately for them at that particular time...

52:38.380 --> 52:39.960
it suits their needs.

52:39.960 --> 52:43.210
In that sense, Mazdas are like seat plungers.

52:43.210 --> 52:46.570
You don't really want one, but
sometimes, you just gotta have one

52:52.340 --> 52:55.100
Mazdas are good cars, for shy exhibitionists.

52:55.100 --> 52:59.420
You could drive one butt naked
through any town in the world...

52:59.530 --> 53:01.710
and not an eye would be batted.

53:01.710 --> 53:03.710
They're practically invisible.

53:10.080 --> 53:13.890
The Mazda 6 needed an image,
so it got one, and it looks...

53:13.890 --> 53:15.300
fantastic.

53:19.970 --> 53:24.990
Mazda confess quite openly to leaning over the
shoulders and cribbing from BMW and Volkswagen.

53:25.220 --> 53:28.450
But they haven't been stupid enough
just to turn out a straight copy.

53:28.560 --> 53:29.000
Oh no.

53:29.610 --> 53:32.970
The interior doesn't look like a Japanese copy of a

53:32.970 --> 53:33.950
German design.

53:34.140 --> 53:36.080
This is a Japanese design.

53:36.080 --> 53:38.080
They've used their own ideas.

53:38.320 --> 53:41.100
And the changes are much more then merely cosmetic

53:44.520 --> 53:46.030
They haven't messed around for this car.

53:46.030 --> 53:49.510
They haven't just tweaked the old 626
and launched it as an all new motor.

53:49.560 --> 53:52.650
This is entirely new. So,
there's a whole new rage of engines.

53:52.950 --> 53:55.670
This is a 2.3 liter, 4 cylinder job.

53:55.800 --> 53:58.050
The figures, really aren't that good.

53:58.610 --> 54:01.870
On paper it's about 166 brake
horsepower.It's very interesting.

54:01.870 --> 54:04.260
0-60 is claimed in 9 seconds.

54:04.770 --> 54:05.700
Ho hum.

54:05.700 --> 54:07.460
But that doesn't tell the whole story

54:07.460 --> 54:10.990
The point is it's tuned so that
it's... a constant power delivery.

54:10.990 --> 54:13.220
It's mid-range. It's always there.

54:13.220 --> 54:16.100
It feels like a bigger, lazier engine than it really is.

54:22.740 --> 54:24.790
And then there's the handling which, well...

54:24.970 --> 54:26.640
where did this come from?

54:26.640 --> 54:28.170
This is a Mazda, yes?

54:28.360 --> 54:30.170
Are we quite sure?

54:30.170 --> 54:31.890
It goes round corners...

54:31.890 --> 54:33.890
really, really well.

54:34.240 --> 54:35.890
It just grips and grips.

54:36.090 --> 54:38.650
If anything it's encouraging me to misbehave.

54:38.650 --> 54:40.650
And I particularly like that.

54:48.840 --> 54:50.190
This is incredible.

54:54.050 --> 54:57.970
It is exciting to drive and I was really not expecting that.

54:58.250 --> 55:00.220
It's just such a shock.

55:00.220 --> 55:05.130
Like discovering someone really grey and average
like, like John Major, is a shagmeister.

55:14.480 --> 55:17.780
One blip does make itself abundantly clear pretty quickly...

55:18.010 --> 55:20.260
It's quite noisy. As soon as you just

55:20.260 --> 55:23.290
head off in one direction for any
length of time with any speed on...

55:23.580 --> 55:25.290
there's a lot of road rumble and wind noise.

55:25.520 --> 55:27.950
That's gonna be bad news when you get to the motorways.

55:32.060 --> 55:33.660
So how much will it cost?

55:33.660 --> 55:38.240
Well the cheapest BMW 3 series is 18,695 quid.

55:38.240 --> 55:40.800
and for that you'll be lucky if you get a sun visor.

55:40.800 --> 55:44.000
This is the top spec Mazda 6. It's got everything on it.

55:44.160 --> 55:48.620
And it'll cost you, 17,995 quid.

55:49.040 --> 55:54.010
So, will value for money, cure Milton Keynes man of his BMW addiction?

55:54.010 --> 55:55.080
Probably not.

55:56.470 --> 55:58.590
This, is still a Mazda.

55:58.590 --> 56:00.590
People will think of it, as a Mazda.

56:00.790 --> 56:02.670
So no matter how good it is, let's be honest...

56:02.670 --> 56:05.340
the life of luxury and excitement in the south of France...

56:05.340 --> 56:07.340
does not await the Mazda 6.

56:07.340 --> 56:08.170
I'm sorry.

56:08.750 --> 56:11.910
For you it's gonna be a life of having up and down the M5.

56:11.940 --> 56:14.300
The M4. Service stations.

56:14.300 --> 56:15.600
Cheap motels.

56:18.280 --> 56:21.020
But it makes me fool good that at least we've brought it out here for a...

56:21.020 --> 56:23.290
final, damn good thrashing.

56:23.590 --> 56:26.400
A final day out, a final fling before you begin your...

56:26.500 --> 56:29.150
life of misery and servitude.

56:33.250 --> 56:34.600
Now i've driven this car...

56:34.600 --> 56:37.010
And I couldn't believe how brilliant it was.

56:37.010 --> 56:39.250
It... it just feels so tight.

56:39.250 --> 56:41.320
And sharp, and it's a Mazda.

56:41.320 --> 56:42.050
I know.

56:42.050 --> 56:45.670
And 700 pounds cheaper than a
BMW, another 700 pounds saved.

56:45.670 --> 56:47.460
With more power and more kit.

56:47.460 --> 56:49.630
quite an achievement. Right, more science.

56:49.630 --> 56:51.760
Final attempt at this. We've been trying to prove...

56:51.760 --> 56:54.970
Is it possible for a car to go
fast enough to beat a speed camera?

56:54.970 --> 56:57.580
so far all we've proven is that
it's really, really difficult.

56:57.580 --> 57:00.770
We had a race track, a Stig to drive the cars, really fast cars...

57:00.770 --> 57:03.630
haven't done it. We're gonna have one last go.

57:08.500 --> 57:10.760
So far, yes I agree, we've failed.

57:10.760 --> 57:14.880
But we haven't disproved the theory,
just that we need a quicker car.

57:18.780 --> 57:19.900
Something like this.

57:19.900 --> 57:23.560
TVR... Tuscan S.

57:23.560 --> 57:28.690
Remember this would be a crazy thing to do if we
weren't using a professional racing driver...

57:28.690 --> 57:29.910
on our own test track.

57:47.210 --> 57:48.590
No flash.

57:48.590 --> 57:50.980
It never went off. It was going so fast.

57:50.980 --> 57:53.700
It was over 170 miles an hour. The camera never saw it.

57:53.700 --> 57:54.490
Seriously?

57:54.490 --> 57:56.200
Absolutely, so we've proven...

57:56.200 --> 57:58.440
It is a mug's game, you need two miles of track...

57:58.440 --> 58:01.950
you need a car that will do 170 miles
an hour, but in the name of science...

58:02.490 --> 58:03.670
we did it.

58:07.830 --> 58:11.320
And on that happy note we have to start winding up the show.

58:11.320 --> 58:14.760
The vegetarian car is still going round outside.

58:14.760 --> 58:17.950
Next week, I go to Wales with an RS Focus.

58:17.950 --> 58:23.380
We've got Jamiroquai frontman Jay Kay
coming here to try and go faster than Harry Enfield.

58:23.380 --> 58:25.380
And, you know...

58:25.380 --> 58:28.120
You're always seeing people, with motorbikes...

58:28.120 --> 58:30.490
try to se how many buses they can jump?

58:30.490 --> 58:31.070
Yeah?

58:31.070 --> 58:34.630
Well next week, we're gonna see
how many bikes we can jump...

58:34.630 --> 58:35.400
with a bus.

58:36.890 --> 58:38.960
See you then, good night!

59:01.160 --> 59:04.700
It's called... a Nissan Mildred.

59:05.305 --> 59:11.347
