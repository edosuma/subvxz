In entertainment news,
over 450 million people

00:04.938 --> 00:07.702
tuned into yesterday's broadcast
of the Rose Parade,

00:07.741 --> 00:10.107
seen in over 24
foreign countries,

00:10.143 --> 00:14.079
where it was billed as
Baywatch with blossoms.

00:15.215 --> 00:16.978
I wanted to sleep till noon.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.712
You're getting
too goal-oriented, Steve.

00:18.752 --> 00:22.188
It's the last day of vacation.

00:22.222 --> 00:24.315
I don't know about you,
I've had about enough vacation.

00:27.660 --> 00:29.821
Ah, look who it is.

00:31.431 --> 00:33.023
- Hey, baby, I missed you!
- Hi.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.399
Oh, I like this.

00:35.435 --> 00:39.098
I'm gone two days, and
you're ready and waiting.

00:39.139 --> 00:41.004
What happened to your eye?

00:41.107 --> 00:42.369
Oh, a little...

00:42.409 --> 00:44.240
New Year's souvenir.

00:44.277 --> 00:45.972
I'm sure he'd be happy
to tell you all about it.

00:46.012 --> 00:47.775
Actually, Brandon's the one
with the story here.

00:47.814 --> 00:48.781
He got crunched.

00:48.815 --> 00:50.009
Would you like me to tell her?

00:50.083 --> 00:51.448
Would you like to tell her?

00:51.484 --> 00:53.452
No, no, no,
I think the story can...

00:53.486 --> 00:54.851
Guys, please,
just cut to the chase.

00:54.888 --> 00:55.877
What'd I miss?

00:55.922 --> 00:58.015
Sure.

00:58.058 --> 01:01.084
It was New Year's Eve and, uh...

01:01.127 --> 01:02.651
we were at the After Dark.

01:02.695 --> 01:04.424
It was just after midnight,

01:04.464 --> 01:06.557
and Susan's ex-boyfriend
was back in town.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.175
So, who was the guy
kissing Susan?

02:29.215 --> 02:30.409
Jonathan Casten.

02:30.450 --> 02:31.974
Susan's ex-boyfriend.

02:32.085 --> 02:35.418
Maybe I'd better hear
the whole story.

02:35.455 --> 02:36.888
Why don't we start
at the beginning?

02:36.923 --> 02:37.890
New Year's Eve morning.

02:37.924 --> 02:39.983
Yeah, it started off bad

02:40.093 --> 02:42.459
and then went downhill
from there.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.429
You see, it all started
when my father conned me into

02:44.464 --> 02:46.898
taking care of my two teenage
half brothers for the weekend

02:46.933 --> 02:48.127
and that beautiful morning
when I saw

02:48.168 --> 02:50.693
the front yard had been TP'd.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.677
Austin! Ryan!

03:41.721 --> 03:44.246
Get down here!

03:44.290 --> 03:45.587
What is this?

03:46.626 --> 03:48.560
What's up, bro?

03:48.595 --> 03:49.823
Why don't you tell me?

03:57.503 --> 03:58.731
Oh, no, man.

03:58.771 --> 04:00.636
- Someone TP'd the house.
- That's horrid.

04:00.673 --> 04:02.470
- That's heinous.
- Hmm.

04:02.508 --> 04:03.941
And you wouldn't know
anything about it?

04:03.977 --> 04:05.444
Well, I think someone's

04:05.478 --> 04:06.945
trying to send you
a message, Steve.

04:07.013 --> 04:08.708
Really? And what
would that message be?

04:08.748 --> 04:11.308
Hmm, maybe you ticked
a couple guys off or something.

04:11.351 --> 04:12.716
Yeah, you know, like,

04:12.752 --> 04:14.913
maybe they wanted to
borrow your Corvette

04:14.954 --> 04:16.922
and, like, you said "no."

04:16.956 --> 04:18.685
Why don't you guys
get out of my sight?

04:18.725 --> 04:19.885
- Cool.
- No, wait.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.086
You know what?

04:21.127 --> 04:22.856
On second thought,
I think I'd like to see

04:22.895 --> 04:24.419
you stick around
and clean up every shred

04:24.464 --> 04:26.227
of that stuff.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.528
You got one hour.

04:27.567 --> 04:29.467
Whoa, he sounds mad.

04:29.502 --> 04:31.595
You haven't seen mad!

04:37.076 --> 04:38.441
You saw, huh?

04:38.478 --> 04:39.445
I'm gonna kill them.

04:39.479 --> 04:41.140
No, I'm gonna kill Rush.

04:41.180 --> 04:42.545
I can't believe
he made me take care

04:42.582 --> 04:43.981
of those two baboons
this weekend...

04:44.083 --> 04:45.072
New Year's Eve weekend.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.710
They're your brothers, dude.

04:46.753 --> 04:48.186
They're my half brothers.

04:48.221 --> 04:49.688
And they're the wrong half.

04:49.722 --> 04:52.589
I'd just like to know where the
monkey part is in your family,

04:52.625 --> 04:53.990
because you do refer to them as

04:54.060 --> 04:55.823
the flying monkey boys,
isn't that...

04:55.862 --> 04:57.989
Excuse me.

04:58.097 --> 05:00.930
Yeah, well,
those monkeys are grounded.

05:02.335 --> 05:03.529
Hello.

05:03.569 --> 05:04.763
Hey, you're up early.

05:04.804 --> 05:08.103
Uh, yeah, I had to pick
someone up at the airport.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.506
Oh, yeah? Who's in?

05:09.542 --> 05:11.169
Jonathan.

05:11.210 --> 05:14.873
Uh, you remember,
uh, last year's Condor editor?

05:14.914 --> 05:15.903
Casten's here?

05:15.948 --> 05:19.111
Yeah, on a, uh,
layover from Tahiti.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.551
Total surprise.

05:20.586 --> 05:21.848
He called from the plane.

05:21.888 --> 05:22.946
That's nice.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.489
Yeah. Looks like he'll be

05:24.524 --> 05:26.492
staying through New Year's.

05:26.526 --> 05:28.084
Great.

05:28.127 --> 05:31.654
Um, listen, I was thinking,

05:31.698 --> 05:34.292
would you be upset
if I flaked

05:34.334 --> 05:35.323
on Colin's New Year's thing?

05:35.368 --> 05:36.699
Yes.

05:36.736 --> 05:38.328
Come on,
you said you weren't even

05:38.371 --> 05:39.565
that interested in going.

05:39.605 --> 05:40.936
No, that's not true.

05:40.973 --> 05:42.497
I'm very interested
in going to Colin's thing.

05:42.542 --> 05:44.874
Okay, I'll be there.

05:44.911 --> 05:45.935
I just, uh,

05:45.978 --> 05:49.539
I might be a little late.

05:49.582 --> 05:50.606
How late?

05:50.650 --> 05:52.208
Never mind. I'll be on time.

05:53.252 --> 05:54.583
Okay. I'll see you there.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.212
- Okay, bye.
- Yeah, bye.

05:59.659 --> 06:01.320
Hey, Brandon.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.124
Hey. You all ready for tonight?

06:03.162 --> 06:04.390
Yeah, the club's all sold out.

06:04.430 --> 06:05.454
Should be quite an evening.

06:05.498 --> 06:06.465
I'm excited.

06:06.499 --> 06:07.761
Yeah, me, too.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.631
You know, of all the years
I've been going out,

06:09.669 --> 06:11.330
I've never been
with anybody I loved

06:11.371 --> 06:12.736
at midnight on New Year's Eve.

06:12.772 --> 06:16.765
It's always turned out to be
quite a lonely night.

06:16.809 --> 06:18.299
I've had a couple
of those myself.

06:18.344 --> 06:19.641
But this year, you got David.

06:19.679 --> 06:21.044
And you've got Susan.

06:23.082 --> 06:24.379
Yeah.

06:24.417 --> 06:25.406
I've got Susan.

06:27.420 --> 06:28.387
So what happened that night?

06:28.421 --> 06:30.855
Slow down, hold on.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.517
Oh, coffee.

06:32.558 --> 06:35.049
Me. Huh.

06:35.094 --> 06:36.186
- Hi.
- Hey, Clare.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.958
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.292
How was San Diego?

06:39.332 --> 06:41.391
Uh, I don't know.
I'm kind of getting

06:41.434 --> 06:43.425
that, uh, New Year's
with the chancellor

06:43.469 --> 06:44.834
doesn't really compare
to the local news.

06:44.871 --> 06:46.463
Yes, it was memorable here.

06:46.506 --> 06:47.973
Oh, uh, by the way,
uh, Donna called

06:48.007 --> 06:49.440
while you were
taking the tree out.

06:49.475 --> 06:51.500
Probably had something to do
with that stupid bird.

06:52.545 --> 06:53.512
What about the stupid bird?

06:53.546 --> 06:54.774
Oh, it flew the coop.

06:54.814 --> 06:56.281
And you're being blamed
for it, by the way.

06:56.315 --> 06:57.942
Me? What are you, what are you

06:57.984 --> 06:58.951
talking about?
I wasn't even here.

06:58.985 --> 07:00.213
Don't you remember,

07:00.253 --> 07:01.914
a couple of hours
before you left for San Diego?

07:01.988 --> 07:03.888
When I came over
to say good-bye?

07:03.923 --> 07:06.448
Oh, right, we were,
uh, taking a nap.

07:08.227 --> 07:09.922
Joe loves Donna.

07:11.197 --> 07:12.164
Joe loves Donna.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.560
What's the matter?

07:16.602 --> 07:18.832
All I can think of
when we're kissing

07:18.871 --> 07:21.271
is how I want
to kill that bird.

07:21.307 --> 07:23.605
I thought I was the only one.

07:28.214 --> 07:30.239
You're scaring her.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.511
Sorry.

07:31.551 --> 07:33.041
Just give me one more second,

07:33.085 --> 07:36.384
and I'll have this thing done.

07:36.422 --> 07:37.787
Can I have
the paper clip, please?

07:37.824 --> 07:39.018
Mm-hmm.

07:41.027 --> 07:42.460
You think it's gonna be okay?

07:42.495 --> 07:43.792
Yeah, it should.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.559
And then after the holiday,
I'll take this cage back

07:45.598 --> 07:47.532
- and get you another one, okay?
- Cool.

07:47.567 --> 07:50.195
Well, I'm glad you came by.

07:50.236 --> 07:51.203
Me, too.

07:51.237 --> 07:52.204
Don.

07:52.238 --> 07:53.227
Come in.

07:54.273 --> 07:56.833
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:56.876 --> 08:01.370
Uh, any chance
we can, um, cover the birdcage

08:01.414 --> 08:03.314
or put a muzzle on her
or something?

08:04.517 --> 08:05.541
That's mean.

08:05.585 --> 08:07.177
- She's not that loud.
- No.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.312
Compared to what?

08:08.354 --> 08:09.321
A jackhammer?

08:09.355 --> 08:11.915
Clare, look, I'm sorry,

08:12.024 --> 08:13.355
but Joe's just fixing the cage

08:13.392 --> 08:14.654
and then she'll settle down.

08:14.694 --> 08:15.683
Why, what's wrong with the cage?

08:15.728 --> 08:17.491
The latch is busted.

08:18.865 --> 08:22.266
So it would be very helpful
if you and Kelly made sure

08:22.301 --> 08:23.632
that no one opened it.

08:23.669 --> 08:25.899
Yeah, sure.

08:25.938 --> 08:28.998
Wouldn't want the little birdie
to fly away, would we?

08:31.010 --> 08:32.705
Joe loves Donna.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.472
Are you okay?

08:35.515 --> 08:39.212
I swear, I never
touched that cage.

08:39.251 --> 08:40.219
I didn't!

08:40.253 --> 08:43.086
I believe you, Clare.

08:43.121 --> 08:45.590
But that's not the end to
the bird story.

08:45.625 --> 08:46.592
Is it, Silver?

08:46.626 --> 08:48.093
I really don't want to hear

08:48.127 --> 08:50.220
any more about the damn bird,
if you don't mind.

08:50.263 --> 08:51.525
Me neither.

08:51.564 --> 08:53.464
It caused David and I
enough problems that night.

08:53.499 --> 08:56.798
Yeah, well, if you wouldn't
have started with me,

08:56.836 --> 08:57.825
it never would have happened.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.167
I didn't start up with you.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.105
Yes, you did.

09:01.140 --> 09:03.108
Okay, guys, picture this:

09:03.142 --> 09:05.804
we're at Colin's party...

09:21.827 --> 09:23.124
Hey.

09:23.162 --> 09:25.255
Excuse me.

09:25.298 --> 09:26.356
What's going on out here?

09:26.399 --> 09:28.333
- Let go of my arm.
- What are you doing?

09:28.367 --> 09:30.096
What does it look like
I'm doing, having group sex?

09:30.136 --> 09:31.364
No, it looks like
a little gathering

09:31.404 --> 09:32.632
of the cokeheads, if you ask me.

09:32.672 --> 09:34.537
Well, I'm not doing any,
so get off my back.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.099
I just want to have
a great night with you, okay?

09:37.143 --> 09:38.440
Well, just stay straight.

09:38.477 --> 09:40.138
Yes, sir.

09:40.179 --> 09:42.113
- I'm serious, Val.
- So am I.

09:42.148 --> 09:43.240
I mean, don't you have to, uh,

09:43.282 --> 09:44.442
go meet your mother
for dinner or something?

09:44.483 --> 09:46.314
What, are you trying
to get rid of me?

09:46.352 --> 09:48.547
Yeah, yeah, I'm trying
to get rid of you.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.057
Well, at least we agree
on something.

09:53.092 --> 09:54.616
Yeah.

10:01.334 --> 10:03.632
That's more like it.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.739
I'll meet you at the club
as soon as I can.

10:14.981 --> 10:16.881
Silver, see you next year, bud.

10:16.916 --> 10:18.213
Ah, definitely.

10:18.250 --> 10:19.547
I just had to try.

10:19.585 --> 10:21.985
All right, good night.

10:23.389 --> 10:24.549
No luck?

10:24.590 --> 10:25.648
No, not yet.

10:25.691 --> 10:26.749
Really can't think of anyone?

10:26.792 --> 10:28.783
Uh... no.

10:30.162 --> 10:31.129
You're not even trying.

10:31.163 --> 10:32.357
Who are you kidding?

10:32.398 --> 10:33.365
Are you kidding me?

10:33.399 --> 10:34.491
There's nothing I would like

10:34.533 --> 10:36.797
more than for young Jonathan
to find a date.

10:36.836 --> 10:38.269
Besides finding
a different place

10:38.304 --> 10:40.101
to ring in the New Year
than the After Dark.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.504
Oh, come on, there's...

10:41.540 --> 10:42.973
Brandon, there's nothing
I can do about this.

10:43.009 --> 10:45.102
He found out The Corrs are
playing and, he... I don't know...

10:45.144 --> 10:46.304
he just gets silly
for Irish bands.

10:46.345 --> 10:48.006
I just don't understand
how a guy who was

10:48.080 --> 10:50.105
so well connected at C.U.
cannot find a date.

10:50.149 --> 10:51.548
It's New Year's Eve.

10:51.584 --> 10:53.347
Please don't make any more
out of this than there is.

10:53.386 --> 10:55.377
Fine.

10:55.421 --> 10:56.979
I just didn't think
it was your responsibility

10:57.023 --> 10:58.718
to be his, uh, social director,
Julie McCoy.

10:58.758 --> 11:00.191
O-Okay, point taken.

11:00.226 --> 11:01.488
All right, ship's away.

11:01.527 --> 11:03.893
Would you just hold it for me?

11:03.929 --> 11:05.419
Why?

11:05.464 --> 11:08.262
If Kelly catches me with coke...

11:08.300 --> 11:09.767
let's just say
it wouldn't be good.

11:09.802 --> 11:11.429
Okay?

11:11.470 --> 11:13.404
Please?

11:19.378 --> 11:21.243
Is that for my benefit,
I wonder?

11:22.648 --> 11:24.240
Kel, they don't even
know you're here.

11:24.283 --> 11:26.342
My point exactly.

11:30.056 --> 11:31.717
Thanks for keeping him warm,
Val.

11:31.757 --> 11:34.817
No problem.

11:37.263 --> 11:39.754
Isn't there some sort of, um,

11:39.799 --> 11:41.232
repellent you can use with her?

11:41.267 --> 11:42.461
It's New Year's.

11:42.501 --> 11:44.435
And we need
to make a New Year's resolution.

11:44.470 --> 11:45.960
How about no more fighting
about Valerie?

11:46.005 --> 11:47.472
Fine.

11:47.506 --> 11:49.906
You're not back
into the holiday cheer, are you?

11:49.942 --> 11:51.409
Absolutely not.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.537
Oh, good, then you
won't mind if I...

11:53.579 --> 11:54.739
What are you doing?

11:54.780 --> 11:55.940
I'm frisking you.

11:55.981 --> 11:57.471
Frisk away. I'm clean.

11:57.516 --> 11:59.006
Oh.

12:17.536 --> 12:18.969
So, didn't anyone have
a good New Year's Eve?

12:19.071 --> 12:20.971
Clare, you're jumping ahead.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.371
Yeah. If you really want
to get the full impact

12:23.409 --> 12:24.774
of what went on that night,

12:24.810 --> 12:26.710
you really have to listen
to every little detail.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.304
Okay, fine.

12:28.347 --> 12:29.905
I just want to hear
how you got the black eye.

12:29.949 --> 12:31.246
Yeah, Steve, how did you get
that black eye?

12:32.685 --> 12:34.448
Better pour yourself
some more coffee, kiddo.

12:34.487 --> 12:35.784
This could take a while.

12:35.821 --> 12:37.618
Well, the party
at the After Dark

12:37.656 --> 12:40.591
sure started out great.

14:11.984 --> 14:13.576
Sorry, guys. Sold out.

14:13.619 --> 14:15.177
Our names are supposed to be
on the guest list, man.

14:15.221 --> 14:18.281
Sanders... Austin and Ryan.
We're Steve's brothers.

14:18.324 --> 14:19.188
He didn't say anything to me.

14:19.225 --> 14:20.749
Well, you better go find him.

14:20.793 --> 14:22.124
Dude, he'll be furious
if he finds out

14:22.161 --> 14:23.253
that we couldn't get in.

14:23.295 --> 14:24.660
All right.

14:24.697 --> 14:25.755
Wait right here.

14:25.798 --> 14:27.789
Hey, no problem.

14:57.162 --> 14:58.959
Jonathan, you came.

14:58.998 --> 15:00.431
Well, I couldn't let the lack

15:00.466 --> 15:01.933
of a date keep me away.

15:01.967 --> 15:05.198
You, uh... you remember Brandon,
right?

15:05.237 --> 15:06.499
The ex-pres, right?
Yeah, sure.

15:06.538 --> 15:07.698
Sure.

15:07.740 --> 15:08.707
Don't worry about it.
Don't get up.

15:08.741 --> 15:09.901
It's all right.

15:09.942 --> 15:11.136
How you doing?

15:11.176 --> 15:14.737
Well, to tell you the truth,
I'm exhausted.

15:14.780 --> 15:16.270
Let's see, it's, uh...

15:16.315 --> 15:19.250
well, it's only 10:00 tomorrow
in the South Pacific.

15:19.285 --> 15:20.843
You should probably
get some sleep.

15:20.886 --> 15:22.183
You're right.

15:22.221 --> 15:24.485
There's a hotel bed waiting
with my name on it.

15:24.523 --> 15:25.717
You, uh...

15:25.758 --> 15:27.282
you going to stay a little
while, though, yeah?

15:27.326 --> 15:29.954
Yeah. Sure. I mean,
it is New Year's Eve, right?

15:30.062 --> 15:31.654
That it is.

15:32.898 --> 15:34.297
So, what were you doing
in Tahiti?

15:34.333 --> 15:35.630
Oh, I had a rough assignment.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.533
I was rating Club Meds
for Me <i>n</i>'s Jour <i>n</i> a/.

15:39.004 --> 15:40.437
- Oh, poor baby.
- Yeah. Well,

15:40.472 --> 15:42.064
somebody's got to do it.

15:42.107 --> 15:43.233
Hey, I got

15:43.275 --> 15:44.902
to tell you, Brandon,
I have really been

15:44.944 --> 15:46.878
enjoying your columns.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.638
- My columns?
- Yeah. I got a subscription

15:49.682 --> 15:51.673
to The Co <i>n</i> dor
as a going away present

15:51.717 --> 15:54.083
from the gang at the
paper, and I really

15:54.119 --> 15:55.177
like your work.

15:55.220 --> 15:57.245
Well, thanks.

16:18.110 --> 16:20.442
Valerie, I can't believe it.

16:20.479 --> 16:21.707
You really pulled this off.

16:21.747 --> 16:23.112
Thank you.

16:23.148 --> 16:24.547
I just wish David
would get here.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.073
He turned me on to The Corrs,

16:26.118 --> 16:27.915
and now he's missing
the whole thing.

16:27.953 --> 16:29.250
Where is Silverado?

16:29.288 --> 16:30.380
I don't know.

16:30.422 --> 16:31.719
He said he'd call me right back,

16:31.757 --> 16:33.349
and that was two hours ago.

16:36.628 --> 16:38.391
Can you see her?

16:38.430 --> 16:39.692
Yeah, move the light
a little higher.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.097
Joe loves Donna.

16:41.133 --> 16:42.964
Perfect.

16:43.068 --> 16:44.296
Come on, baby. Come on.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.065
Come on.

16:46.105 --> 16:47.402
Aw!

16:47.439 --> 16:48.565
- Joe loves Donna.
- Damn it.

16:48.607 --> 16:50.199
- What, she's gone?
- No.

16:50.242 --> 16:51.573
She went up to a higher branch.

16:51.610 --> 16:53.578
Damn bird.

16:53.612 --> 16:55.307
Look around and see
if you can find a longer stick.

16:57.616 --> 16:59.379
- So, how did she get out,
anyway? - I don't know.

16:59.418 --> 17:02.410
When I got home from Colin's,
the cage was open,

17:02.454 --> 17:04.319
and she was out on the deck.

17:04.356 --> 17:07.257
Well, she's definitely
enjoying her freedom.

17:12.131 --> 17:14.497
Damn bird loves Donna.

17:14.532 --> 17:16.160
So where is Joe?

17:16.201 --> 17:17.167
He's at some big
alumni function.

17:17.202 --> 17:18.794
He's supposed to be back soon.

17:18.837 --> 17:21.704
Yeah, well, it's New Year's Eve,
and we're up a tree, literally.

17:21.740 --> 17:23.332
I'm sorry.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.933
Look, David,
you don't have to do this.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.306
I know Valerie's
waiting for you.

17:26.345 --> 17:27.607
No. Don't worry about it.

17:27.646 --> 17:28.874
As long as I'm back by midnight,
she'll be fine.

17:28.914 --> 17:31.712
Well, if I didn't say it before,
thank you.

17:31.750 --> 17:33.445
Anything for a friend.

17:33.485 --> 17:34.747
Damn bird.

17:34.787 --> 17:37.620
You know you'll always be
more than a friend.

17:37.656 --> 17:40.284
Yeah, I know.

17:42.961 --> 17:44.952
Joe loves Donna.

17:46.131 --> 17:47.257
Damn it!

17:47.299 --> 17:48.960
She went to a higher branch.

17:49.001 --> 17:50.901
Damn bird.

17:52.137 --> 17:54.867
So, did they ever
catch the damn bird?

17:54.907 --> 17:57.774
Clare, do you always
read the last page first?

17:57.810 --> 18:00.210
Yeah. Of course. Gotta make sure
it's going to be a happy ending.

18:00.245 --> 18:03.180
It is a happy ending, isn't it?

18:03.215 --> 18:04.682
Depends on who you talk to.

18:04.716 --> 18:06.877
So, what happened
with your brothers?

18:06.919 --> 18:08.079
Well, where we last

18:08.120 --> 18:10.088
left off, the boys snuck
into the After Dark.

18:10.122 --> 18:12.784
They're very lucky to be alive.

18:27.873 --> 18:29.101
I don't believe it.

18:29.141 --> 18:30.267
What's the matter?

18:30.309 --> 18:31.435
My brothers are here.

18:31.477 --> 18:32.808
There's a lot of
KEGers here, Steve.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.608
Not my frat brothers.
My real brothers.

18:34.646 --> 18:35.908
Rush's kids.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.212
I'm babysitting for them
while my dad's in Vegas.

18:38.250 --> 18:40.912
Oh. I thought the doorman
meant your KEG brothers.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.420
He said to me two guys were

18:42.454 --> 18:45.184
left off the guest list,
so I told him, let them in.

18:45.224 --> 18:46.657
- You let them in?
- Yeah.

18:46.692 --> 18:48.091
What's the problem?

18:50.963 --> 18:52.089
Hey!

18:52.131 --> 18:54.964
That's the problem.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.331
Watch your hands, buster!

18:56.368 --> 18:57.665
Whoa.

18:57.703 --> 18:58.670
Austin!

18:58.704 --> 19:00.695
Run, Ry! He's on to us!

19:00.739 --> 19:02.798
Would you excuse me, please?

19:02.841 --> 19:04.240
I'll be back
in a couple of years.

19:04.276 --> 19:05.538
Excuse me.

19:05.577 --> 19:06.908
Hey, whoa, whoa!
What's going on?

19:07.012 --> 19:08.570
- My brothers are on the loose.
- Oh.

19:08.614 --> 19:10.081
Kelly, can you help
me get them back?

19:10.115 --> 19:11.412
Why me?

19:11.450 --> 19:12.678
Because they like you.

19:12.718 --> 19:13.878
They listen to you.

19:13.919 --> 19:16.217
- Okay, okay.
- Go.

19:16.255 --> 19:17.449
All right.
We'll be right back.

19:17.489 --> 19:18.478
Thanks, Colin.

19:27.199 --> 19:29.167
So, did you bring it?

19:29.201 --> 19:31.066
You sure you want to do
this with Kelly around?

19:31.103 --> 19:32.832
She's leaving after midnight.

19:32.871 --> 19:34.133
Well, then, I'll see
you after midnight.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.437
Valerie, stop playing games.

19:36.475 --> 19:38.705
Give it to me now.

19:41.313 --> 19:43.713
Fine. If it's that
important to you.

19:43.749 --> 19:44.875
Thanks.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.509
I'll see you a little later.

19:51.790 --> 19:52.950
Make way. Make way.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.617
Pubescent punks being ejected.

19:54.660 --> 19:55.684
Lay off, man!

19:55.727 --> 19:57.126
- This is child abuse.
- Child abuse?!

19:57.162 --> 19:59.062
- Steve, you're embarrassing
them. - Embarrassing them?

19:59.097 --> 20:00.428
They're embarrassing me!

20:00.465 --> 20:01.659
I want you home and in bed now!

20:01.700 --> 20:02.860
I'm going to tell Dad
what a jerk you are.

20:02.901 --> 20:03.765
- Oh...
- Duh.

20:03.802 --> 20:05.497
Like he doesn't already know?

20:05.537 --> 20:06.629
How does this feel, huh?

20:06.672 --> 20:07.730
Good, huh?

20:07.773 --> 20:08.740
I bet you like this.

20:08.774 --> 20:09.900
What is that about?

20:09.942 --> 20:13.469
Steve dishing out
some tribal justice.

20:13.512 --> 20:14.911
Well, speaking
of tribal justice,

20:14.947 --> 20:17.074
let me tell you what happened
to me when I was on the

20:17.115 --> 20:18.412
Lollapalooza tour last summer.

20:18.450 --> 20:19.849
It was crazy.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.443
Actually, if you could
just put a pin in that.

20:21.486 --> 20:22.680
The powder room calls.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.279
I'll be right back.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.859
You know, Jonathan,

20:28.894 --> 20:31.089
I wasn't exactly looking forward
to seeing you again,

20:31.129 --> 20:33.927
but you're all right, man.

20:33.966 --> 20:36.526
Thanks.
But you might not think so

20:36.568 --> 20:38.126
after I tell you
the real reason I'm here.

20:38.170 --> 20:39.797
It's not the music?

20:39.838 --> 20:41.999
I'm in love with her, Brandon.

20:42.074 --> 20:45.441
And I've been
with enough women to know

20:45.477 --> 20:47.240
Susan's the one I want.

20:49.114 --> 20:52.015
Then why did you break up
with her in the first place?

20:52.050 --> 20:53.142
Susan didn't tell you?

20:53.185 --> 20:55.016
No. Not really.

20:55.053 --> 20:57.647
Well, I'm not surprised.

20:57.689 --> 20:59.179
It was very personal.

20:59.224 --> 21:00.953
I see.

21:00.993 --> 21:02.517
Performance problems?

21:02.561 --> 21:03.755
That's funny.

21:03.795 --> 21:05.126
But I'll tell you

21:05.163 --> 21:07.654
right now, there is a bond
between Susan and me

21:07.699 --> 21:10.293
that no one could
ever come between.

21:10.335 --> 21:11.859
And I'm supposed to...?

21:11.903 --> 21:14.394
I don't care what you do,
Walsh.

21:14.439 --> 21:15.929
You're irrelevant.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.849
I'll tell you what I'm going
to do for you, Jonathan.

21:25.884 --> 21:29.285
I'm going to chalk this whole
conversation up to jet lag.

21:29.321 --> 21:30.754
All right, big guy?

21:32.224 --> 21:33.521
Okay.

21:33.558 --> 21:34.855
Enough talk.
Who wants to dance?

21:34.893 --> 21:36.190
That's me.

21:48.540 --> 21:50.667
I can't believe you danced.

21:50.709 --> 21:51.971
Exactly.

21:52.010 --> 21:53.534
I was desperate.

21:53.578 --> 21:55.705
It was quite a sight.

21:55.747 --> 21:58.147
That's a part of the story
even I haven't heard.

21:58.183 --> 22:00.743
You missed it because, when it
was getting close to midnight,

22:00.786 --> 22:03.152
you were too busy
with your old girlfriend.

22:06.825 --> 22:08.417
Thanks, David.

22:08.460 --> 22:10.360
I think I can take it from here.

22:10.395 --> 22:11.726
Sorry, I couldn't get her
out of the tree.

22:11.763 --> 22:13.958
But at least she's staying put.

22:13.999 --> 22:15.830
Oh, Donna,
can I use your car phone?

22:15.867 --> 22:17.732
Um, I really need to call Val.

22:17.769 --> 22:19.600
- Sure, the keys are in the car.
- Thanks.

22:19.638 --> 22:22.607
I have put way too much work
into that damn bird

22:22.641 --> 22:23.835
to give up without a fight.

22:23.875 --> 22:25.206
Wish me luck.

22:25.243 --> 22:27.677
Good luck.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.839
Not exactly the way I thought
we'd be ringing in the New Year.

22:31.883 --> 22:34.977
Well, happy 1996.

22:35.053 --> 22:36.816
It will be...

22:36.855 --> 22:38.447
as soon as I get that damn bird.

22:38.490 --> 22:40.617
Yeah, well,
I'm beginning to think

22:40.659 --> 22:42.991
that's what we should
have named her.

22:43.095 --> 22:45.120
Allow me.

22:47.566 --> 22:49.625
Come on...

22:51.870 --> 22:54.270
Come on, Val,
it's almost midnight.

23:05.517 --> 23:06.814
Four...

23:06.852 --> 23:09.946
three... two... one!

23:10.055 --> 23:12.387
Happy New Year...!

23:42.220 --> 23:43.744
That's my New Year's resolution,

23:43.789 --> 23:45.654
not to let you go.

23:45.690 --> 23:47.988
I thought your New Year's
resolution was to start jogging.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.391
Jogging? Oh, yeah.

24:06.344 --> 24:08.835
Here's to a fabulous 1996.

24:08.880 --> 24:11.940
You've definitely
made my '95 fabulous.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.551
I don't mean to be a drag,
but...

24:21.593 --> 24:23.322
we have to get up
for the parade soon.

24:23.361 --> 24:24.726
Come on, it's New Year's Eve.

24:24.763 --> 24:26.321
The band's just
starting up again.

24:26.364 --> 24:27.956
I know, I know,
but I have to get up

24:28.066 --> 24:29.363
in a few hours
and help Donna get ready.

24:29.401 --> 24:31.426
Well, maybe I should
take you home now.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.597
- No, you don't have to.
- You sure?

24:33.638 --> 24:35.799
Yes, I can
find my way home fine.

24:35.841 --> 24:37.468
But I will be at your house
to pick you up at 6:00 a.m.,

24:37.509 --> 24:38.601
so be ready.

24:38.643 --> 24:40.577
- I'll be up and ready to go.
- Good.

24:40.612 --> 24:42.079
Walk me out.

24:54.259 --> 24:56.090
Well, I, uh, I've got
to get a move on.

24:56.127 --> 24:57.890
So, um...

24:57.929 --> 24:59.988
Happy New Year, Suse.

25:00.065 --> 25:01.157
The happiest to you, too.

25:06.037 --> 25:07.664
Jonathan, don't.

25:07.706 --> 25:08.673
- What?
- Hey! Hey!

25:08.707 --> 25:11.369
- That's it.
- What's it?

25:11.409 --> 25:13.502
Brandon, please.
It's all right.

25:13.545 --> 25:14.739
No, it's not all right.

25:14.779 --> 25:17.213
Can we please just drop this?

25:17.249 --> 25:18.876
Well, I'd like to,

25:18.917 --> 25:20.714
but, uh, I don't think
Walsh wants to.

25:20.752 --> 25:22.379
Is that an invitation, Junior?

25:22.420 --> 25:24.718
Because we could always go
outside and I could drop you.

25:24.756 --> 25:25.882
Brandon, please.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.486
Good night.

25:29.528 --> 25:32.497
I'm sorry I caused
you so much trouble.

25:34.332 --> 25:35.822
Jonathan, I don't want you
leaving upset.

25:40.805 --> 25:43.899
Hey, he's a big boy.
Let him go.

25:43.942 --> 25:45.637
I can't.

25:45.677 --> 25:47.406
There are some things
between him and me

25:47.445 --> 25:49.538
that you just don't...

25:49.581 --> 25:50.878
you just don't understand.

26:02.494 --> 26:04.860
I just shouldn't let that guy
get to me like that.

26:04.896 --> 26:07.296
Jealousy is a hard thing
to control.

26:07.332 --> 26:08.856
I can't believe
I missed the action.

26:08.900 --> 26:11.494
You didn't miss
any action, my brother.

26:13.371 --> 26:15.498
So, where were you at the stroke
of midnight, anyway, Steve?

26:15.540 --> 26:17.098
I was in Valerie's office...

26:17.142 --> 26:18.507
having phone sex with Clare.

26:18.543 --> 26:20.067
Steve.

26:20.111 --> 26:21.669
Disregard that, please.

26:23.048 --> 26:24.242
So, did you talk to Susan?

26:24.282 --> 26:25.510
No.

26:25.550 --> 26:27.108
I think I'm all talked out.

26:35.093 --> 26:38.620
Brandon,
why don't you just call her?

26:38.663 --> 26:40.255
I think it's on her to call me.

26:40.298 --> 26:41.856
And what if she doesn't?

26:41.900 --> 26:43.333
Well, then, she doesn't.

26:46.438 --> 26:47.666
What's for breakfast?

26:47.706 --> 26:49.139
Yeah, I'm really hungry.

26:49.174 --> 26:50.232
What're you telling me for?

26:50.275 --> 26:51.537
Why don't you talk
to your keeper?

26:51.576 --> 26:53.168
- He's in the kitchen.
- Thanks, Val.

26:53.211 --> 26:56.203
Oh. You look really hot today.

26:56.247 --> 26:58.943
Yeah, scorching.

27:00.852 --> 27:02.319
That must be quite an ego boost.

27:02.354 --> 27:03.548
Shut up.

27:03.588 --> 27:05.613
All right.

27:05.657 --> 27:07.420
Ah...

27:07.459 --> 27:08.653
Well, well, well...

27:08.693 --> 27:10.718
11:00 and the demon seeds rise.

27:10.762 --> 27:13.663
What productive
citizens you guys are.

27:13.698 --> 27:15.757
So, these are the famous
Sanders brothers, huh?

27:15.800 --> 27:17.392
Don't talk to them, Clare.

27:17.435 --> 27:20.836
Get your bowls, get your gruel
and get out of here, okay?

27:20.872 --> 27:24.831
Boy, are you guys in big trouble
when Dad comes home.

27:24.876 --> 27:27.174
Thanks a lot, bro.

27:27.212 --> 27:29.874
You get what you deserve.

27:29.914 --> 27:30.938
Come on, Ry.

27:31.049 --> 27:32.516
I think there's
a hooter movie on cable.

27:32.550 --> 27:34.450
- Hooters.
- Yes.

27:39.557 --> 27:42.151
Steve, you're not really going
to burn them, are you?

27:42.193 --> 27:43.353
Damn right, I am.

27:43.395 --> 27:45.625
For what?

27:45.664 --> 27:47.655
Crashing the party?
TPing the house?

27:47.699 --> 27:49.599
- I mean...
- No. No, for New Year's Eve.

27:49.634 --> 27:50.828
After I threw them
out of the club,

27:50.869 --> 27:52.632
they crossed way over the line.

28:01.579 --> 28:04.377
Oh, my God!

28:04.416 --> 28:06.475
They shaving creamed my car!

28:06.518 --> 28:07.917
Who?

28:07.952 --> 28:10.318
The festering boils on my
butt... Austin and Ryan.

28:10.355 --> 28:12.346
I'm gonna kill them.

28:13.992 --> 28:15.926
Ow!
That's gotta hurt.

28:16.027 --> 28:16.891
Are you okay?

28:16.928 --> 28:19.158
Son of a...!

28:20.465 --> 28:24.299
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year!

28:25.403 --> 28:27.837
I said Happy New Year!

28:27.872 --> 28:29.305
You guys look great!

28:29.340 --> 28:30.500
Happy New Year.

28:32.043 --> 28:33.067
Whoa!

28:33.111 --> 28:35.079
Now there's a piece of work.

28:35.113 --> 28:36.740
Who's the artist?
You see this?

28:36.781 --> 28:38.442
Colin, Colin, I told you,
you're not driving.

28:38.483 --> 28:39.472
I'm not driving.

28:39.517 --> 28:41.144
You're driving me.

28:41.186 --> 28:42.983
You're loaded.
Come on.

28:44.789 --> 28:46.154
Get in the car.

28:49.294 --> 28:50.556
Val, why don't you
call him a cab?

28:50.595 --> 28:51.960
I tried, but there aren't any.

28:52.063 --> 28:53.052
Listen, I'll be right back.

28:53.098 --> 28:54.065
Can you hold
the fort down for me?

28:54.099 --> 28:55.964
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks, Nat.

28:56.000 --> 28:56.989
Drive carefully.

29:01.239 --> 29:02.763
SoHo, please.

29:02.807 --> 29:04.707
And step on it.

29:17.388 --> 29:18.855
Excuse me.

29:21.926 --> 29:23.154
They did a good job.

29:23.194 --> 29:25.458
They're gonna pay.

29:25.497 --> 29:27.465
Hey, guys.
This is nice.

29:27.499 --> 29:29.262
Thank you.

29:30.235 --> 29:31.361
Is Val inside?

29:31.402 --> 29:32.835
- You just missed her.
- I missed her?

29:32.871 --> 29:34.634
Where the hell did she go?
It's only 1:15.

29:34.672 --> 29:36.071
She took Colin home.

29:36.107 --> 29:38.439
That's just great.

29:38.476 --> 29:40.273
I've been stuck
at a sobriety checkpoint

29:40.311 --> 29:41.869
for the past hour on Sunset.

29:41.913 --> 29:45.007
Cops are really out
in force tonight.

29:54.859 --> 29:56.292
- Give me your stash.
- Relax.

29:56.327 --> 29:57.885
Colin, they're
searching the cars.

29:57.929 --> 29:59.055
Will you get rid of it?

29:59.097 --> 30:00.894
I don't have anything.
I did it all.

30:00.932 --> 30:01.864
You're sure?

30:01.900 --> 30:03.060
Of course I'm sure.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.371
Good evening, ma'am.
Happy New Year.

30:08.406 --> 30:09.771
Same to you, Officer.

30:09.808 --> 30:10.866
Have you been drinking?

30:10.909 --> 30:12.968
No, no,
I'm the designated driver,

30:13.077 --> 30:16.638
and I'm with a very talented,
but inebriated artist on board.

30:16.681 --> 30:18.342
I'm just trying
to deposit him safely at home.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.445
All right.

30:21.486 --> 30:23.078
Have a nice evening.
Drive carefully.

30:23.121 --> 30:24.247
Thank you.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.418
What an idiot.

30:29.460 --> 30:30.688
What?

30:30.728 --> 30:32.559
My stash was in your ashtray
the whole time.

30:32.597 --> 30:34.895
You're sick.

30:37.502 --> 30:40.471
You know what,
you need your head examined.

30:47.712 --> 30:49.339
God, you are so lucky.

30:49.380 --> 30:50.472
Tell me about it.

30:50.515 --> 30:52.380
I screamed at Colin
for the next ten blocks,

30:52.417 --> 30:53.543
but he'd already crashed out.

30:53.585 --> 30:56.145
I had to drag him up the
stairs to his apartment.

30:56.187 --> 30:57.916
That's what she says.

30:57.956 --> 30:59.150
David, you know

30:59.190 --> 31:01.818
I came right back to the club.

31:01.860 --> 31:04.454
Well, at least the evening
wasn't a total bust.

31:05.830 --> 31:07.263
Hi.

31:07.298 --> 31:08.663
Hey.

31:08.700 --> 31:09.758
Hello, ladies.

31:09.801 --> 31:11.701
What's going on?

31:11.736 --> 31:13.727
Well, we're catching
Clare up on New Year's.

31:13.771 --> 31:15.466
All the dirt.

31:15.506 --> 31:17.667
Oh, so that's why
my ears were burning.

31:17.709 --> 31:20.507
Don, I had nothing to do with
the bird getting out, okay?

31:20.545 --> 31:22.638
I'm sorry you lost her.

31:22.680 --> 31:24.147
No, you're not.

31:24.182 --> 31:26.207
But don't worry about it.
Joe found her this morning.

31:26.251 --> 31:28.242
Oh, great.

31:28.286 --> 31:30.220
Yeah, well, we decided
to donate her

31:30.255 --> 31:31.916
to the aviary
at the L.A. Zoo.

31:31.956 --> 31:33.287
So you can come on home now.

31:33.324 --> 31:34.450
Good.

31:34.492 --> 31:37.290
All's well that ends well.

31:37.328 --> 31:39.728
Yeah, but it sure
didn't seem that way

31:39.764 --> 31:42.289
early New Year's morning.

31:42.333 --> 31:45.894
The bird was still gone
and Joe was a man obsessed.

31:45.937 --> 31:47.427
Look, this is not David's fault.

31:47.472 --> 31:48.734
He is not a bird catcher.

31:48.773 --> 31:50.104
Yeah, well...

31:50.141 --> 31:52.006
if he hadn't chased the bird
so high up the tree,

31:52.076 --> 31:53.907
I might have had
a chance to grab her.

31:53.945 --> 31:55.344
Look, can we just
forget about this?

31:55.380 --> 31:57.974
The bird is not that important.

31:58.016 --> 31:59.506
Oh, really?

31:59.550 --> 32:02.815
Do you know how many hours

32:02.854 --> 32:04.253
I spent training that damn bird?

32:04.289 --> 32:05.586
Well, do you know
how many hours

32:05.623 --> 32:07.284
I have put into
the Tournament of Roses?

32:07.325 --> 32:08.952
And in 45 minutes,
they're picking me up.

32:09.027 --> 32:10.961
I have to look good
and feel good in front of

32:11.062 --> 32:13.053
ten zillion television
viewers worldwide.

32:14.432 --> 32:15.592
Where are you going?

32:15.633 --> 32:16.657
To get the cage.

32:16.701 --> 32:17.963
I figure maybe if she saw it,

32:18.002 --> 32:19.333
- she'd jump in it.
- Yeah, well,

32:19.370 --> 32:21.361
she flew out of the cage,
do you remember that?

32:22.440 --> 32:24.965
I've got to try something.

32:25.076 --> 32:26.976
Humph. Great.

32:27.011 --> 32:28.808
You're going to go back
to the park?

32:30.214 --> 32:31.476
Oh, you're crazy.

32:31.516 --> 32:33.575
The bird probably flew
away the second we left.

32:33.618 --> 32:36.052
Yeah, and whose fault
would that be?

32:37.588 --> 32:39.249
Joe, I have to get ready.

32:45.263 --> 32:46.287
Joe!

32:46.331 --> 32:48.765
We can't just forget about her.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.233
She's our bird.

32:50.268 --> 32:51.633
Don't you care about her?

32:51.669 --> 32:53.637
Yes.
Yes, of course I do.

32:53.671 --> 32:56.640
No, you don't.

32:58.009 --> 32:59.374
You go to Pasadena,
I'll see you later.

32:59.410 --> 33:00.570
You know what, forget it.

33:00.611 --> 33:02.772
With that attitude,
don't bother coming.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.078
Fine.

33:12.557 --> 33:14.320
He's crazy, Kel.

33:14.359 --> 33:16.384
He's gonna go spend the
whole night up in a tree.

33:16.427 --> 33:18.827
He'll come down eventually.

33:18.863 --> 33:20.797
Come on, aren't they gonna
come pick you up now?

33:20.832 --> 33:23.824
I have been up all night.

33:23.868 --> 33:25.859
That is what they
invented makeup for.

33:27.839 --> 33:29.966
And so, at dawn
on New Year's morning,

33:30.074 --> 33:32.201
with Donna headed for Pasadena,

33:32.243 --> 33:34.177
I went over to Colin's
to pick him up.

33:34.212 --> 33:36.237
He wasn't exactly ready
for a parade.

33:49.694 --> 33:50.854
Come on, sleepyhead.

33:50.895 --> 33:52.328
You're supposed to be up.

33:52.363 --> 33:53.853
Go away.

33:53.898 --> 33:55.456
Come on, I'll make
you some coffee.

33:55.500 --> 33:56.524
- Will that help?
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

33:56.567 --> 33:57.829
Just leave me alone.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.530
What do you mean,
leave you alone?

33:59.570 --> 34:00.832
You're supposed to come with me.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.840
No, you don't understand.

34:02.874 --> 34:04.739
I can't.
My head's pounding.

34:04.776 --> 34:05.936
Did you get high last night?

34:05.977 --> 34:07.638
Come on, Kelly,
it was New Year's Eve.

34:07.678 --> 34:08.940
Oh, I see.

34:09.013 --> 34:10.947
So that's why you were so eager
for me to leave.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.311
Who did you get
high with? Valerie?

34:12.350 --> 34:14.750
Let me go back to sleep,
all right? We can fight later.

34:14.786 --> 34:16.150
My head's killing me.

34:16.187 --> 34:18.087
I got a headache.

34:18.121 --> 34:20.181
Don't ask me
to get you the aspirin.

34:20.224 --> 34:22.192
I picked up my addict mother
off the floor.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.956
I'm not gonna do the same
for you.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.963
Fine. I'm-I'm coming.

34:29.534 --> 34:31.263
I'm coming.

34:41.312 --> 34:43.246
Don't stop now. I still haven't
heard about New Year's Day.

34:43.281 --> 34:45.715
Oh, man, I'd rather forget
about New Year's Day.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.377
Yeah, you never told me
what happened either.

34:47.418 --> 34:48.385
I want to hear.

34:48.418 --> 34:49.750
Oh, you're stuck now, boss.

34:49.786 --> 34:51.118
- Spill it.
- Yeah, where were you?

34:51.155 --> 34:53.248
- You never came to Pasadena.
- That's because

34:53.291 --> 34:55.987
when I got up at dawn and called
over to Susan's place...

34:56.060 --> 34:57.186
she wasn't even there.

34:57.228 --> 34:58.286
Uh-oh.

34:58.329 --> 34:59.261
So, what did you do?

34:59.297 --> 35:01.197
I went over to The Co <i>n</i> dor

35:01.232 --> 35:03.928
to throw myself into my work.

35:03.968 --> 35:05.936
That turned out to be
an even bigger mistake.

35:18.983 --> 35:21.178
Oh, boy...

35:23.721 --> 35:24.949
Well, it looks like you two

35:24.989 --> 35:27.219
just kept the party
going last night.

35:28.226 --> 35:30.285
What about you?
Did you, uh,

35:30.328 --> 35:31.886
find that fight
you were looking for?

35:31.929 --> 35:33.157
There's really
something going on

35:33.197 --> 35:34.255
between you two, isn't there?

35:34.298 --> 35:36.289
No.

35:36.334 --> 35:39.360
No more than there's something
going on between you and Kelly.

35:40.538 --> 35:41.971
But you didn't exactly see us

35:42.006 --> 35:44.406
playing tonsil hockey
last night, now, did you?

35:48.679 --> 35:51.239
Look, I don't want to cause
any trouble between you guys.

35:52.250 --> 35:55.549
Brandon,
whatever I said or did

35:55.586 --> 35:57.952
to offend you last night,
I apologize. I take it back.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.787
Great.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.087
He's serious.

36:03.528 --> 36:06.326
Listen, Suse,
Boynton's wife said

36:06.364 --> 36:08.594
it would mean a lot to him
if I'd stop by.

36:08.633 --> 36:10.123
- Then you should go.
- You know,

36:10.168 --> 36:11.328
he'd love to see you, too.

36:13.571 --> 36:14.595
Um...

36:14.639 --> 36:17.369
Boynton used to be
the, uh, paper's

36:17.408 --> 36:18.636
- old faculty advisor.
- Yeah, yeah.

36:18.676 --> 36:20.974
I know who he is,
and I know he's very ill.

36:21.979 --> 36:23.310
You know, I'll...

36:23.347 --> 36:24.473
I'll meet you outside.

36:24.515 --> 36:25.812
Okay.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.283
I'll, uh, see you
around, Brandon.

36:27.318 --> 36:28.512
Yeah.

36:34.692 --> 36:35.954
Why did you two break up anyway?

36:36.027 --> 36:37.460
You make such a cute couple.

36:37.495 --> 36:42.159
You know, I'm really
not up to having

36:42.200 --> 36:43.599
this conversation
with you right now.

36:44.769 --> 36:46.999
I just, I really have to go.

36:48.606 --> 36:49.971
That's great.
Why don't you just, uh,

36:50.074 --> 36:54.636
let me know
when you are ready, okay?

36:54.679 --> 36:56.408
Have a nice day.

36:56.447 --> 36:57.471
Or a nice life.

37:08.125 --> 37:11.060
And it's a winter wonderland
in Pasadena.

37:11.095 --> 37:13.120
For those of you
who never thought it possible

37:13.164 --> 37:15.428
to ice skate outdoors
in Southern California...

37:28.012 --> 37:30.276
That was
the Fantasy Trophy float.

37:30.314 --> 37:31.542
Three more until the Royal.

37:31.582 --> 37:32.810
Poor Donna.

37:32.850 --> 37:35.148
If Joe doesn't show up,
I'm gonna punch him.

37:39.223 --> 37:40.417
Excuse us.

37:42.893 --> 37:44.690
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:44.729 --> 37:46.287
It's about time
you guys showed up.

37:46.330 --> 37:48.093
You know, it's a new year.

37:48.132 --> 37:50.692
I made a resolution
not to even talk to you.

37:52.036 --> 37:54.766
All right, don't talk,
but you better listen.

37:54.805 --> 37:56.295
I'm surprised
you're even up, Val.

37:56.340 --> 37:58.205
Your little coke buddy's
down for the count.

37:58.242 --> 37:59.766
Oh, is that what
this little snit is about?

37:59.810 --> 38:01.437
He was fine when I left him.

38:01.479 --> 38:03.003
Look, if you want to shoot
the messenger, that's fine,

38:03.047 --> 38:04.241
but I had nothing to do with it.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.716
Oh. Like you didn't get him high
at Christmas.

38:06.751 --> 38:10.243
Whatever you may think of me,
I don't do cocaine.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.779
I'm supposed
to believe that, right?

38:12.823 --> 38:14.723
I don't really care
one way or the other.

38:14.759 --> 38:16.283
All I care about is Colin.

38:19.163 --> 38:20.460
What is this?

38:20.498 --> 38:21.487
It's Colin's.

38:21.532 --> 38:23.090
I confiscated it last night.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.260
Now it's yours.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.530
Why?

38:26.804 --> 38:28.465
You're his girlfriend...
you deal with it.

38:28.506 --> 38:30.667
Or break up with him.
I don't care.

38:30.708 --> 38:31.936
I'm washing my hands
of the whole thing.

38:32.009 --> 38:33.806
Why didn't you just dump it,
Valerie?

38:33.844 --> 38:35.573
Because I wanted you
to believe me.

38:36.647 --> 38:38.638
Let him deny it's not his.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.415
Hey, here comes Donna's float.

38:42.453 --> 38:44.284
And there they are at last,

38:44.322 --> 38:46.950
the gorgeous young ladies
of the Royal Court, on this,

38:47.058 --> 38:49.618
the 106th anniversary

38:49.660 --> 38:52.220
of the Pasadena
Tournament of Roses.

38:59.236 --> 39:01.261
Oh, look at her.
She looks beautiful.

39:03.741 --> 39:06.005
Donna!

39:07.211 --> 39:08.303
- Donna!
- He made it.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.745
Well, I hope she can see him.

39:09.780 --> 39:11.543
Donna!

39:12.583 --> 39:14.983
Donna!

39:16.053 --> 39:16.815
Donna!

39:18.556 --> 39:20.183
Donna!

39:20.224 --> 39:22.556
Joe.

39:43.314 --> 39:45.111
Well, nothing like
a happy ending.

39:45.149 --> 39:46.810
It was for Donna.

39:46.851 --> 39:48.785
Yeah, Joe was so sweet
about everything.

39:48.819 --> 39:50.810
All that fuss over a bird.

39:50.855 --> 39:52.823
Like you didn't
fuss over that bird?

39:52.857 --> 39:54.620
I waited three hours for you.

39:54.658 --> 39:55.818
Kids, it's over.

39:55.860 --> 39:57.350
We survived New Year's.

39:57.395 --> 39:58.623
Some of us did.

39:58.662 --> 40:01.529
Beavis and Butthead are,
like, so played out already.

40:01.565 --> 40:04.591
Well, excuse me,
master tube-watcher.

40:04.635 --> 40:07.069
George of the Ju <i>n</i> g/e...
now that rules.

40:08.672 --> 40:09.969
Hey!

40:10.007 --> 40:11.599
Rinse the bowl out
before you put it

40:11.642 --> 40:12.904
in the dishwasher, okay?

40:12.943 --> 40:14.171
Oh, please.

40:14.211 --> 40:16.202
Like you've ever done that
in your life.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.408
Honey, not in front of the kids.

40:19.517 --> 40:20.711
Excuse me.

40:25.356 --> 40:27.324
Hello?

40:27.358 --> 40:28.757
Oh, hi. Happy New Year.

40:29.827 --> 40:32.318
Yeah. Yeah, he's right here.

40:32.363 --> 40:33.387
It's Rush.

40:33.431 --> 40:34.693
Rush...

40:35.800 --> 40:39.668
You guys are dead. Dead!

40:39.703 --> 40:41.261
Come on, man, please
don't say anything.

40:41.305 --> 40:43.330
- Ryan'll be your slave. - Man,
what are you talking about?

40:43.374 --> 40:45.604
All right, we'll both
be your slaves. Please.

40:45.643 --> 40:46.871
You don't know
what he's gonna do.

40:46.911 --> 40:48.469
He's gonna tell us
how we always screw up.

40:48.512 --> 40:49.911
Don't ever do anything right.

40:49.947 --> 40:51.107
How we're so stupid.

40:51.148 --> 40:52.945
You have no idea how that feels.

40:59.390 --> 41:01.290
Hi, Dad.

41:01.325 --> 41:02.815
Oh, yeah.

41:02.860 --> 41:04.725
No, they were, uh... great.

41:05.896 --> 41:06.954
Actually, I was hoping

41:06.997 --> 41:08.430
they could spend
another evening with us.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.161
We're having a fantastic time.

41:11.469 --> 41:12.458
Yeah.

41:12.503 --> 41:13.663
Yeah, okay. You, too.

41:13.704 --> 41:14.864
Bye-bye.

41:17.341 --> 41:18.365
We're not worthy.

41:18.409 --> 41:19.398
Your wish is our command.

41:19.443 --> 41:22.310
Okay, in that case,

41:22.346 --> 41:24.712
there's a lawn mower
and a rake in the shed.

41:24.748 --> 41:26.909
- Get busy.
- Yes, sir!

41:28.586 --> 41:30.486
Why'd you let them
off the hook so easy?

41:30.521 --> 41:33.319
They're family.

41:33.357 --> 41:35.689
And I like George of the Ju <i>n</i> g/e.

41:52.176 --> 41:53.666
I thought you had a gardener.

41:53.711 --> 41:55.008
Just don't tell them that.

42:07.258 --> 42:09.590
Excuse me for a second, guys.

42:12.997 --> 42:17.400
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:17.434 --> 42:20.494
You're, uh... not
gonna invite me back?

42:20.538 --> 42:21.971
There's a lot of
people back there.

42:22.006 --> 42:24.099
I don't want there
to be a scene.

42:25.209 --> 42:26.437
I missed you.

42:26.477 --> 42:28.707
I missed you, too.

42:30.014 --> 42:31.845
Look, Jonathan's flown
back home to Seattle,

42:31.882 --> 42:33.281
if that's what
you're wondering.

42:35.886 --> 42:36.978
Nothing happened.

42:37.021 --> 42:38.648
That must have
been quite a fight,

42:38.689 --> 42:40.156
seeing what a studly guy he is.

42:40.190 --> 42:42.522
Please.

42:42.560 --> 42:43.993
Don't make me sorry I came here.

42:44.094 --> 42:46.062
What's he got over you?

42:47.898 --> 42:49.991
Nothing I can ever change.

42:53.237 --> 42:55.330
But I love you...

42:55.372 --> 42:56.669
and that's what I told him.

42:56.707 --> 42:58.572
He's not gonna give you up.

42:59.944 --> 43:02.412
Well, then that's his problem,
isn't it?

43:05.316 --> 43:07.341
Can't you take "yes"
for an answer?

43:12.590 --> 43:15.957
You know, uh...

43:15.993 --> 43:19.622
a long time ago
someone told me that, uh,

43:19.663 --> 43:22.564
when you strike oil,
you should stop drilling.

43:27.671 --> 43:29.764
So, um... are you stopping?

43:32.943 --> 43:34.774
I don't know, I think maybe

43:34.812 --> 43:36.006
I'm just kinda getting started.

43:45.489 --> 43:48.822
Well, it looks like
we can close the book

43:48.859 --> 43:50.986
on this New Year's tale.

43:51.028 --> 43:52.256
"The End."

43:56.433 --> 43:58.492
Happy New Year.
