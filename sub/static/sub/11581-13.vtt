00:01.035 --> 00:03.104
NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system,

00:03.137 --> 00:06.340
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.374 --> 00:08.709
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.742 --> 00:10.711
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.744 --> 00:12.246
are members of an elite squad

00:12.280 --> 00:14.082
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.115 --> 00:16.384
These are their stories.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.687
This ain't no job
for the squeamish.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.622
You find dog crap, pick it up.

00:21.655 --> 00:23.357
Used condom, pick it up.

00:23.391 --> 00:26.660
A needle, be careful,
but you gotta pick it up.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.562
Okay.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.532
What the hell?

00:31.565 --> 00:32.533
Hey, hey, Jimmy.

00:32.566 --> 00:33.701
Take a look at this.

00:36.404 --> 00:38.206
Is that blood
in those bowls?

00:38.239 --> 00:40.674
Yeah. You get that sometimes.

00:40.708 --> 00:44.145
Wackos sacrificing animals.

00:46.347 --> 00:47.548
Mother of God.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.150
Buddy, you ain't
gonna last too long

00:49.183 --> 00:51.219
if you let a few dead chickens
creep you out.

00:51.252 --> 00:52.720
Uh, Jimmy.

00:52.753 --> 00:55.089
This ain't no chicken.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.227
WARNER:
Black male.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.129
I'd say seven or
eight years old.

01:01.162 --> 01:02.663
Head, arms and
legs are missing.

01:02.696 --> 01:04.598
Looks like some kind
of ritual killing.

01:04.632 --> 01:06.767
Could be. The limbs were
severed through the bone

01:06.800 --> 01:08.136
instead of at the joints.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.138
There are easier
ways to cut up a body.

01:10.138 --> 01:12.140
I'll check the
blood in those bowls,

01:12.140 --> 01:13.441
see if it's his.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.443
BENSON:
Did you see anybody
hanging around?

01:15.476 --> 01:19.147
Nah, it's too cold,
even for the homeless.

01:19.180 --> 01:20.148
We're going to need
all the trash

01:20.148 --> 01:21.782
that you picked up in the area.
Everything.

01:21.815 --> 01:24.152
You find stuff
like this before?

01:24.152 --> 01:27.155
Couple of dead
goats, birds.

01:27.188 --> 01:29.290
There's pretty freaky
people in this city.

01:29.323 --> 01:30.791
WARNER:
Detectives?

01:30.824 --> 01:32.493
Thank you so much.

01:32.526 --> 01:34.362
You know, animals
I've heard of.

01:34.395 --> 01:36.164
What religion
sacrifices kids?

01:36.164 --> 01:37.631
None that I know of.

01:37.665 --> 01:39.333
Any chance he died
of something else,

01:39.367 --> 01:41.169
and this is some kind
of funeral rite?

01:41.169 --> 01:43.304
There's blood
clotting at the neck.

01:43.337 --> 01:47.175
This boy's throat was cut
when he was still alive.

02:37.725 --> 02:39.627
The child bled out when
his carotid artery was cut,

02:39.660 --> 02:41.429
then he was dismembered.

02:41.462 --> 02:42.830
He's in rigor, so
I put time of death

02:42.863 --> 02:43.797
around 12 hours ago.

02:43.831 --> 02:44.932
Is there anything
to support

02:44.965 --> 02:46.066
the ritual sacrifice
theory?

02:46.099 --> 02:48.502
Whoever did this knew exactly
what they were doing.

02:48.536 --> 02:49.503
So this wasn't
a hack job.

02:49.537 --> 02:50.671
No.

02:50.704 --> 02:51.639
After he died,

02:51.672 --> 02:53.807
the extremities were
removed methodically.

02:53.841 --> 02:57.678
First, the flesh around the
limbs and neck was flensed.

02:57.711 --> 02:58.812
What?

02:58.846 --> 03:00.414
Scraped from the bone,

03:00.448 --> 03:02.383
using a sharp
knife like this.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.252
Then the bone was
severed with one blow

03:04.285 --> 03:06.254
from something like
a butcher's cleaver.

03:06.254 --> 03:07.688
What about the blood
in the bowls?

03:07.721 --> 03:08.856
Blood type matches
your victim.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.858
My bet, DNA will, too.

03:10.891 --> 03:13.394
I've never seen anything
like this before.

03:13.427 --> 03:14.728
A dismemberment?
Sure you have.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.630
Not where the blood was
drained from the body

03:16.664 --> 03:17.731
by hanging it
upside down.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.267
How can you tell?

03:19.267 --> 03:21.969
The blood coagulated at
the top of the spleen

03:22.002 --> 03:23.871
which means the
body was inverted.

03:23.904 --> 03:26.407
So, is there any way
we can ID him?

03:26.440 --> 03:28.742
An old scar
on the abdomen.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.644
Not surgical,

03:30.678 --> 03:31.912
but the wound was severe.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.881
STABLER:
Well, if it's from abuse,

03:33.914 --> 03:35.749
maybe we got a record of it.

03:35.783 --> 03:36.917
I doubt it.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.419
No signs of torture
or other trauma.

03:38.452 --> 03:41.655
This child healthy and well fed.

03:41.689 --> 03:43.624
No hits from missing persons
in the tristate area

03:43.657 --> 03:44.725
going back three years.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.927
National Center for Missing
and Exploited Children

03:46.960 --> 03:49.463
lists four kids with
the right age and race,

03:49.497 --> 03:51.465
none with abdominal scars.

03:51.499 --> 03:53.301
A kid killed
for religious reasons.

03:53.334 --> 03:54.968
Probably related
to the murderer.

03:55.002 --> 03:58.472
Get DNA from those four kids'
parents just to make sure.

03:58.506 --> 04:00.474
Guy who teaches the occult
at the Academy

04:00.508 --> 04:03.477
confirms that that's the kind of
candle they use in Santeria.

04:03.511 --> 04:05.813
First practiced by slaves
brought here from Africa.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.981
Owners forced them to convert
to Christianity,

04:08.015 --> 04:11.352
so the slaves just put
saint names on their old gods.

04:11.385 --> 04:12.520
How do you know all that?

04:12.553 --> 04:14.422
Drug dealers from
the Caribbean and
South America

04:14.455 --> 04:15.489
practice Santeria.

04:15.523 --> 04:16.824
Put hexes on me,
threw grave dust.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.692
I can't tell you how many
dead chickens I found

04:18.726 --> 04:19.893
out in front of the precinct.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.329
Yeah, well,
killing a chicken's

04:21.362 --> 04:22.796
a long way from human sacrifice.

04:22.830 --> 04:23.997
Which Santeria
stopped doing

04:24.031 --> 04:26.400
about a century ago.

04:26.434 --> 04:27.601
Let's go with what we got.

04:27.635 --> 04:30.371
A ritualized murder by somebody
who may practice Santeria.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.373
"Martinez Imports."

04:32.406 --> 04:34.742
Olivia, Elliot,
pay them a visit.

04:36.076 --> 04:38.011
MAN:
Yeah, we made this.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.913
STABLER:
For who?

04:39.947 --> 04:41.549
Hey, that's a long list.

04:41.582 --> 04:44.017
I supply hundreds of
botanicas and churches.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.720
Is there any way to tell where
you sent a particular candle?

04:46.754 --> 04:48.389
Come on, we sell
thousands every month.

04:48.422 --> 04:49.957
Well, maybe you could
just check for us.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.059
Come on, we don't want to bother
all your customers.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.394
( sighs )

04:53.427 --> 04:55.028
Can I see the
candle again.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.997
Ah, you're in luck.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.600
This is our
new St. Cecilia.

05:00.768 --> 05:02.903
You know, she was one of
our first Christian martyrs.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.738
The executioner tried
to cut her head off...

05:04.772 --> 05:05.873
And failed. I know.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.775
Could you do that list
for us?

05:07.808 --> 05:09.109
Yeah, sure.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.380
Okay, let's see what we got.

05:14.482 --> 05:16.450
Ah. Here we go.

05:16.484 --> 05:19.787
Okay, so far they've been
shipped to three buyers.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.789
One in Miami,
one in New Orleans,

05:21.822 --> 05:22.956
and one in New York.

05:22.990 --> 05:26.394
The Center
for the Study of Santeria.

05:27.127 --> 05:29.397
Thank you so much.

05:29.397 --> 05:30.464
This is outrageous.

05:30.498 --> 05:32.099
Santeria's a peaceful religion.

05:32.132 --> 05:32.933
We're not murderers.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.968
We're not accusing you
of anything.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.137
Mr. Odufemi, we have some
questions about these candles

05:37.170 --> 05:38.972
that you bought
from Martinez Imports.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.408
Well, we buy them
by the case,

05:40.408 --> 05:41.809
and we sell them at
cost to our members.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.110
We're going to need
a membership list.

05:43.143 --> 05:44.077
Why?

05:44.111 --> 05:46.146
We had nothing to do
with this child's death.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.848
Sir, with all due respect,

05:47.881 --> 05:51.018
your religion has a history
of human sacrifice.

05:51.051 --> 05:53.854
Are either one
of you Catholic?

05:53.887 --> 05:55.856
I am.

05:55.889 --> 05:56.857
Well...

05:56.890 --> 05:59.893
your church teaches that
when you take communion,

05:59.927 --> 06:02.696
you are consuming the
body and blood of Christ.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.031
Does that make
you a cannibal?

06:04.064 --> 06:06.867
This is about a murder,
not religious tradition.

06:06.900 --> 06:11.038
Our church outlawed human
sacrifice in the 1930s.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.506
There hasn't
been one since.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.442
You sacrifice animals.
Humanely.

06:14.442 --> 06:15.809
And I'm sure, as you know,

06:15.843 --> 06:18.178
the Supreme Court
ruled our rituals legal.

06:18.211 --> 06:21.482
Sir, I don't give a damn
about your legal rituals.

06:21.515 --> 06:22.783
A candle you sold

06:22.816 --> 06:25.719
was placed a few feet
from a dismembered child.

06:25.753 --> 06:28.922
If you don't have a court order,
I'm not giving you our list.

06:28.956 --> 06:30.958
Why not? If your church
outlawed ritual murder,

06:30.991 --> 06:32.793
your members have nothing
to fear from us.

06:32.826 --> 06:35.529
Except for persecution
based on your bigotry.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.831
Now, should I show you
to the door,

06:37.865 --> 06:40.200
or can you find
your own way out?

06:40.233 --> 06:43.170
STABLER:
The guy was definitely hostile.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.204
NOVAK:
I might be hostile

06:44.237 --> 06:45.906
if you accuse my religion
of child sacrifice.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.541
We still need a list
of his members.

06:47.575 --> 06:48.876
From what you told me,

06:48.909 --> 06:50.711
he never came out and
said there was a list.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.780
You get us in there,
we'll find it.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.682
Hey, before we trample
on the Constitution

06:54.715 --> 06:56.884
and attack religious freedom,
we need probable cause.

06:56.917 --> 06:57.918
CRAGEN:
We traced the candle

06:57.951 --> 06:58.886
to Odufemi's center.

06:58.919 --> 06:59.720
But the candles
were also sold

06:59.753 --> 07:01.555
by churches in Miami
and New Orleans.

07:01.589 --> 07:03.223
There's no proof that
the one used in the park

07:03.256 --> 07:04.658
came from the center.
What is this,

07:04.692 --> 07:05.793
a Boy Scout meeting
gone wrong?

07:05.826 --> 07:08.095
You got blood in bowls
and a candle-- it's Santeria.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.930
BENSON:
Casey, we checked
those two churches,

07:09.963 --> 07:11.732
and they haven't sold
any candles yet.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.767
Okay, that's still not
enough for a warrant.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.669
CRAGEN:
Very little of
the victim's blood

07:15.703 --> 07:16.670
was found in the park.

07:16.704 --> 07:18.839
If you're gonna kill a
kid and drain his blood,

07:18.872 --> 07:20.608
you need a place
with some privacy.

07:20.641 --> 07:23.143
Come on, Counselor, just
help us out here, all right?

07:25.178 --> 07:27.581
Talk to everyone who lives and
works near the Santeria Center.

07:27.615 --> 07:30.518
Find me someone
who's seen anything

07:30.551 --> 07:32.686
that backs up your theory.

07:34.622 --> 07:37.525
WOMAN:
I don't want
to sound prejudiced,

07:37.525 --> 07:39.927
but it sounds
like voodoo to me.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.962
Loud music, drums beating.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.797
I know people
have their culture,

07:43.831 --> 07:45.866
but I don't think young people

07:45.899 --> 07:48.101
should be exposed
to such things.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.638
Now, you've seen
children over there?

07:50.671 --> 07:53.106
Oh, coming and going,
sometimes till 10:00.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.975
School nights!

07:55.008 --> 07:57.978
Do you remember seeing any
children there last Monday?

07:58.011 --> 07:59.913
A whole group of them,

07:59.947 --> 08:02.983
not one of them more
than eight years old.

08:03.016 --> 08:06.019
Involving kids with
stuff like that.

08:06.053 --> 08:07.988
It's a crying shame.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.990
MAN:
The Center?

08:10.023 --> 08:12.159
Pretty weird stuff goin' on
in that place.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.861
Give us an example.

08:13.894 --> 08:17.565
The other night, I'm closing up,
I hear this shrieking.

08:17.565 --> 08:19.066
What kind of shrieking?

08:19.099 --> 08:20.834
I figure it was an animal,

08:20.868 --> 08:23.871
with the chicken and goats
I see him bring in.

08:23.904 --> 08:26.139
But when I saw the paper,
I thought,

08:26.173 --> 08:29.877
uh-uh, maybe it was that kid
you found in the park.

08:29.910 --> 08:32.780
NOVAK:
Our detectives found
several witnesses.

08:32.813 --> 08:35.583
Strange behavior is not grounds
for a warrant, Miss Novak.

08:35.583 --> 08:37.951
An eyewitness saw children
going into the center

08:37.985 --> 08:39.219
the night our victim died.

08:39.252 --> 08:41.188
One child would be noteworthy;
a group isn't.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.090
The center holds regular
youth classes.

08:43.123 --> 08:46.059
That same night,
another witness heard
bloodcurdling screams.

08:46.093 --> 08:48.729
Reported by an elderly
white woman and...

08:48.762 --> 08:51.098
what nationality
was the other witness?

08:51.131 --> 08:53.834
Latino.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.103
Like many of the practitioners
of Santeria.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.739
Are you suggesting the witnesses
were racially motivated?

08:58.772 --> 09:00.073
It wouldn't be
the first time

09:00.107 --> 09:01.642
people in this city had problems

09:01.675 --> 09:03.176
with neighbors
of a different color.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.812
A seven-year-old
boy is dead.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.681
Someone cut his throat,

09:07.715 --> 09:10.618
hung him up
and bled him like a pig.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.185
The candle found
near his body

09:12.219 --> 09:14.187
came from the
Santeria Center.

09:14.221 --> 09:17.124
With all due respect,
Your Honor,

09:17.157 --> 09:19.927
we have probable cause.

09:20.994 --> 09:23.130
All right,
you've got your warrant.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.833
I hope this doesn't turn into
a witch-hunt.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.768
O'HALLORAN:
We'll test the stain

09:27.801 --> 09:30.137
on the floor,
but it's probably animal blood.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.272
We found chicken carcasses
in the garbage.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.307
No lists in the filing cabinet
or on the computer.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.677
What'd you do, delete them
after our last visit?

09:36.710 --> 09:37.978
Of course not.
I know the law.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.913
And if you knew anything
about our religion,

09:39.947 --> 09:42.315
you would know that our
believers could never do this.

09:42.349 --> 09:43.651
And what makes you so sure?

09:43.684 --> 09:45.185
The child was
found near a lake.

09:45.218 --> 09:46.153
And that proves what?

09:46.186 --> 09:47.387
The lake is
ruled by Yamaya.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.221
She's an orisha.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.791
The African equivalent
to a saint,

09:50.824 --> 09:54.094
and she's the mother and
protector of all children.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.096
To kill a child in her
name would be blasphemous.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.765
Well, maybe we're looking
for a heretic.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.867
I mean, it's possible
that there are people

09:59.900 --> 10:02.102
still in Africa
practicing human sacrifice,

10:02.135 --> 10:03.336
but not in this country.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.137
Do you have any recent

10:04.171 --> 10:05.906
immigrants
in your congregation?

10:05.939 --> 10:07.307
There's a few,
from West Africa,

10:07.340 --> 10:08.909
but they're not
peasants or farmers.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.844
( phone rings )
These are educated people.

10:10.878 --> 10:12.079
Good.
Benson.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.848
Then they won't
mind talking to me.

10:14.882 --> 10:16.349
What have you got?

10:16.383 --> 10:19.219
I want that list or I'm going
to be here at every service

10:19.252 --> 10:21.121
talking to her and him and him,

10:21.154 --> 10:22.690
and anyone else
who walks through that door.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.224
And I'm going to make damn
sure that Animal Control

10:24.257 --> 10:26.326
and the Health Department
come on down here

10:26.359 --> 10:28.128
and pay you a visit
at least once a day.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.262
BENSON:
We're on our way.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.230
I want that list.

10:30.263 --> 10:33.333
All right.

10:34.367 --> 10:38.038
This is blackmail.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.241
That was Warner.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.276
She got something.

10:44.444 --> 10:47.314
WARNER:
By testing a person's skin

10:47.347 --> 10:48.949
and hair, we can tell

10:48.982 --> 10:52.119
what chemicals they've
been exposed to and when.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.286
Like with drug testing.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.554
Right.

10:54.587 --> 10:57.457
Each geographical area on Earth
has its own chemical signature.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.127
I sent your victim's hair
for an analysis

11:00.160 --> 11:02.295
of hydrogen
and nitrogen isotopes,

11:02.329 --> 11:05.398
and they match isotope levels
in New York City.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.034
Can you tell how
long he's been here?

11:07.067 --> 11:08.969
Based on the rate of hair
growth, I'd say four weeks.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.137
What about before that?

11:10.170 --> 11:12.840
The bones tell that story.

11:12.873 --> 11:15.142
You can tell where he
lived based on his bones?

11:15.175 --> 11:19.012
By analyzing strontium levels
in his skeleton.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.314
This is an X ray
of the boy's hip

11:21.348 --> 11:25.018
and a graph showing the
strontium in his bones.

11:25.052 --> 11:27.320
I consulted a forensic
anthropologist.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.322
He compared the
levels in the boy

11:29.356 --> 11:32.025
with geologic samples
from around the world.

11:32.059 --> 11:34.061
( typing )
He got a match.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.295
STABLER:
Africa.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.965
Can you be more specific?

11:37.998 --> 11:39.466
Nigeria.

11:39.499 --> 11:41.969
Precambrian rock
found only within 100 miles

11:42.002 --> 11:45.072
of Benin City matches
strontium levels in your boy.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.040
Looks like he lived there
all his life.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.842
This kid came to
New York from Nigeria.

11:48.876 --> 11:51.111
Wasn't here more than a
month, and he was killed.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.913
Which is why nobody
reported him missing.

11:52.946 --> 11:55.949
He was brought here
to be sacrificed.

12:00.353 --> 12:01.822
So the victim came here
from Nigeria

12:01.855 --> 12:02.790
within the last four weeks.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.224
Yeah, kind of rules out
the Santeria Center.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.359
No new members from Nigeria.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.128
Yeah, and all the parishioners'
kids are accounted for.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.797
Could be the boy was
here legally.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.799
Yeah, we're going to check
with Immigration,

12:11.799 --> 12:13.033
see if they got him
on file.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.205
The United States accepts

12:18.238 --> 12:20.808
about 2,800 immigrants
from Nigeria each year.

12:20.808 --> 12:22.209
That's more than
200 a month.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.476
How many of them
are kids?

12:23.510 --> 12:26.313
Last month, ten male children
around the age of your victim.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.881
Any way
to check up on them?

12:27.915 --> 12:29.817
After your call,
I sent our people out

12:29.817 --> 12:32.319
to check on the local addresses
listed on their I-94s.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.453
All the kids are safe.

12:33.486 --> 12:35.355
So our kid's
got to be illegal.

12:35.388 --> 12:36.589
Not surprising.

12:36.623 --> 12:40.260
The third largest moneymaker
for organized crime in the US

12:40.293 --> 12:43.430
after drugs and guns,
is the sale of human beings.

12:43.463 --> 12:44.898
You mean world wide.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.266
I mean the United States.

12:46.299 --> 12:49.036
15,000 kids are trafficked
here each year.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.170
A lot from Africa.

12:50.203 --> 12:53.406
Is the Nigerian government
doing anything about this?

12:53.440 --> 12:56.509
There's a woman at their
Consulate, Kema Mabuda.

12:56.543 --> 12:59.246
She's passionate about
stolen children.

13:01.448 --> 13:04.217
The ritual murder of a child?
That is terrible.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.486
Have you come across
anything like it before?

13:06.519 --> 13:09.923
You need to understand,
most Nigerians are educated,

13:09.957 --> 13:12.592
but we do have the largest
population in Africa.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.095
In more remote areas,
tradition dies hard.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.865
So you're saying human
sacrifice does happen.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.867
Possibly.

13:19.900 --> 13:23.103
Hundreds of children vanish
every year from my country,

13:23.136 --> 13:24.872
and Thailand, and Albania.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.573
They end up here and in Europe.

13:26.606 --> 13:27.875
BENSON:
For rituals?

13:27.908 --> 13:29.309
No, the slave trade--

13:31.311 --> 13:33.513
child labor in sweat shops,
as domestics,

13:33.546 --> 13:34.747
or for sexual exploitation.

13:34.781 --> 13:37.117
Some kidnapped, some sold to
smugglers by their own families,

13:37.150 --> 13:39.486
often for as little
as a television set.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.955
STABLER:
Does your government keep
records of missing children?

13:41.989 --> 13:45.525
As best we can; nearly half
our population is under 16.

13:45.558 --> 13:48.095
We've linked our victim
to an area

13:48.128 --> 13:49.129
around Benin City.

13:49.162 --> 13:52.465
Now, have there been
any missing child reports

13:52.499 --> 13:54.267
from that area
in the last month?

13:54.301 --> 13:55.335
No boys that age...

13:55.368 --> 13:56.536
but there is a note.

13:56.569 --> 13:59.572
One of our switchboard operators
logged a call two days ago

13:59.606 --> 14:02.309
from a girl worried about
her missing brother.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.443
Did you get a name?

14:03.476 --> 14:04.311
Ajani.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.445
The note also says
the caller hung up

14:05.478 --> 14:07.480
before the operator could get
any more information.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.950
We could find out
where that girl's call

14:09.983 --> 14:13.486
originated by checking
your phone records.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.522
I have your word your findings

14:15.555 --> 14:17.590
will only be used
in the investigation?

14:17.624 --> 14:20.260
Yes.

14:21.628 --> 14:26.433
Bring me the necessary forms.
I will sign them.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.936
I'm surprised the Consulate
agreed to the phone dump.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.470
Half the population
of Nigeria is Muslim.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.940
Do you think our government
would let them take a peek

14:32.940 --> 14:33.706
at our phone records?

14:33.740 --> 14:35.242
Mabuda knows we're not
interested

14:35.275 --> 14:36.176
in their state secrets.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.111
Eight calls to the consulate
switchboard

14:38.145 --> 14:39.646
around the time Ajani's
sister called.

14:39.679 --> 14:41.614
Split 'em up,
it shouldn't take long.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.086
What do you bet this caller was
looking for

14:46.119 --> 14:47.620
the scoop on safari vacations?

14:47.654 --> 14:50.323
Pretty white bread up here
for anything else.

14:50.357 --> 14:53.326
Yeah, not that many
Nigerian kids in
this neighborhood.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.527
( doorbell ringing )

14:56.663 --> 14:57.630
Can I help you?

14:57.664 --> 14:59.366
Detectives Munch
and Tutuola.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.134
We'd like to talk
to Mr. or Mrs. Laymon.

15:01.168 --> 15:02.235
They're not home.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.337
But if you have a card,
I'll make sure they get it.

15:04.371 --> 15:05.538
You know a child
named Ajani?

15:05.572 --> 15:07.607
I'm sorry, you'll have
to come back.

15:07.640 --> 15:08.608
What's her name?

15:08.641 --> 15:09.609
I have to go now.

15:09.642 --> 15:10.610
No, you don't.

15:10.643 --> 15:12.112
You have no right
to be here.

15:12.145 --> 15:14.081
Unless you want
to spend the night in jail,

15:14.114 --> 15:16.216
stand back, okay?

15:17.684 --> 15:19.252
What's your name?

15:19.286 --> 15:21.121
It's okay.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.623
Did you call about
your brother?

15:23.656 --> 15:25.692
We're here to help you.

15:25.725 --> 15:27.995
Tell me your name.

15:28.028 --> 15:28.996
Na'imah.

15:29.029 --> 15:31.031
You found Ajani?

15:31.064 --> 15:33.000
We're going to take you
someplace safe

15:33.000 --> 15:34.034
and talk about that.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.303
Come on.

15:40.207 --> 15:42.642
I start work at 6:00
and finish at midnight.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.677
I can't go out unless
the rich people

15:44.711 --> 15:45.545
are with me.

15:45.578 --> 15:48.115
How'd you know
that was your brother?

15:48.148 --> 15:50.617
Madam was watching the news.

15:50.650 --> 15:54.021
I heard them say
they found a boy.

15:54.021 --> 15:57.290
They said he had
a mark right here.

15:57.324 --> 16:00.327
Just like Ajani had when
he fell climbing the tree.

16:00.360 --> 16:04.097
How'd you get to this country?

16:04.131 --> 16:06.333
Men. They came to our village.

16:06.366 --> 16:09.102
They told my mother
they would take me

16:09.136 --> 16:11.504
to a wonderful school
in America.

16:11.538 --> 16:14.507
Ajani begged her
to let him come with me.

16:14.541 --> 16:17.410
Na'imah, when you came
to the United States,

16:17.444 --> 16:19.379
where did those men keep you?

16:19.412 --> 16:21.148
A big room
with no windows.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.516
Lots of beds.

16:23.550 --> 16:26.153
People came and looked at us.

16:26.186 --> 16:30.790
I hoped someone would take
my brother and me together,

16:30.823 --> 16:33.326
but Madam only wanted me.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.337
They kept her locked in
a cellar,

16:44.371 --> 16:45.538
so she couldn't get away.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.740
Look, we can collar the Laymons
for unlawful imprisonment.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.376
MABUDA:
As soon as we
find her mother,

16:49.409 --> 16:51.544
we'll arrange to have Ajani's
body shipped home.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.613
What did Munch get
from the housekeeper?

16:53.646 --> 16:55.082
She said Mr. Laymon's
in Zurich.

16:55.082 --> 16:55.982
Madam?

16:56.083 --> 16:57.784
Charity event at
the Windsor Garden Hotel.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.086
I suppose
she does not know--

16:59.086 --> 17:02.822
charity begins at home.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.792
WOMAN:
I want to congratulate
the cochairs

17:05.825 --> 17:08.228
of the flower show host
committee:

17:08.261 --> 17:11.098
Nancy Forner,
Karen Stern, Sheyna Smith.

17:11.098 --> 17:12.632
Ladies, please stand.

17:12.665 --> 17:15.835
( applause )

17:15.868 --> 17:17.804
Second table on the right.

17:17.837 --> 17:21.408
And a special thank you goes to
our design consultant,

17:21.441 --> 17:22.775
Alison Intrieri, for...

17:22.809 --> 17:24.177
Marian Laymon.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.312
Yes?

17:25.345 --> 17:26.746
Police.
Please come with us.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.248
I'll do no such thing.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.617
Sure you will, or we'll
haul your ass out of here.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.519
You don't need to speak
to me that...

17:32.552 --> 17:34.654
Marian Laymon, you are
under arrest

17:34.687 --> 17:37.157
for violation of the United
States Code,

17:37.190 --> 17:38.625
Title 18, Section 1584.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.760
Would you mind telling me
what that means?

17:40.793 --> 17:45.165
We're busting you for
violating the Involuntary
Servitude and Peonage Act.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.834
In case you haven't heard,
Lincoln freed the slaves.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.802
My client wants to clear up
this misunderstanding.

17:49.836 --> 17:50.870
STABLER:
There's no
misunderstanding.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.172
Your client had a slave.

17:52.205 --> 17:53.306
That girl is a domestic.

17:53.340 --> 17:54.641
That's not what
Na'imah says.

17:54.674 --> 17:55.875
She's a liar.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.878
I should've fired her, but I
felt sorry for the poor girl.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.148
Mrs. Laymon opened her home
to a girl

18:01.181 --> 18:02.549
from a disadvantaged background

18:02.582 --> 18:04.151
and provided her
with a job.

18:04.151 --> 18:05.152
That is not a crime.

18:05.152 --> 18:05.785
How did you find her?

18:05.818 --> 18:07.154
She was
referred to me.

18:07.154 --> 18:08.221
By who?

18:08.255 --> 18:10.490
Some day laborer working
at my house.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.159
I don't remember his name.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.561
Maybe you remember
how much you pay her.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.829
LAYMON:
I provide her with
room and board.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.165
For an 18 hour day?

18:18.198 --> 18:19.666
It's more
than she could

18:19.699 --> 18:20.633
ever earn in her country.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.535
And how did she get
from her own country?

18:22.569 --> 18:23.903
That's hardly
Mrs. Laymon's concern.

18:23.936 --> 18:24.904
But you knew

18:24.937 --> 18:26.606
that she was not here legally.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.007
MAN:
Detectives, we all know

18:28.040 --> 18:30.843
how difficult it can be
at times to establish
immigration status.

18:30.877 --> 18:31.844
That's
no excuse.

18:31.878 --> 18:35.548
Harboring an illegal alien
is still a crime.

18:35.582 --> 18:36.716
Half of Park Avenue is guilty.

18:36.749 --> 18:37.917
Look, lady, I don't
give a damn

18:37.950 --> 18:39.219
what you or your
damn friends do.

18:39.252 --> 18:40.487
Slavery's a federal crime.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.890
Now, you're going to be spending
the next ten years in lockdown.

18:43.923 --> 18:45.192
That's not
the Junior League.

18:45.192 --> 18:46.193
You cooperate with us,

18:46.193 --> 18:47.894
we'll put in a good word
for you with the Feds.

18:47.927 --> 18:48.995
If you don't, I guarantee you

18:49.028 --> 18:51.231
you're not going to like the
dress code in the joint.

18:57.304 --> 18:58.938
What can we offer you?

18:58.971 --> 19:02.209
The name of the person
who sold you Na'imah.

19:02.209 --> 19:03.910
I told you, I did not buy her.

19:03.943 --> 19:05.011
I'm done with this, I'm done.

19:05.044 --> 19:08.281
That person is walking free,
you're going to prison.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.417
Book her.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.219
LAWYER:
Hold on. Hold on.

19:12.219 --> 19:13.286
Marion...

19:13.320 --> 19:15.555
All right, I did pay a fee,

19:15.588 --> 19:18.758
but I don't remember
the man's name.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.227
How'd you get in touch with him?

19:20.227 --> 19:21.361
I had a number,

19:21.394 --> 19:25.832
but the person I gave it to
said it was disconnected.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.800
Probably
a prepaid cell.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.270
Where did you get Na'imah?

19:31.304 --> 19:35.808
I went to a warehouse
in Long Island City.

19:40.280 --> 19:43.616
Guy who rented the warehouse
paid cash for a six-month lease.

19:43.650 --> 19:44.751
Never got his name.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.553
Not even to run
a credit check?

19:46.586 --> 19:48.255
It's just storage space.

19:48.255 --> 19:49.256
They pay, they stay.

19:49.256 --> 19:51.891
If not, we padlock it,
auction the contents.

19:51.924 --> 19:53.260
Here we are.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.329
Looks like the guy
ran out of money.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.364
That's not our lock.

19:57.397 --> 19:58.931
He's paid up
for another month.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.400
Bolt cutters.

20:24.591 --> 20:26.326
The light.

20:31.831 --> 20:34.367
BENSON:
Oh, my God.

20:48.548 --> 20:51.017
It's okay.
We came here to help you.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.894
His name is Ajani.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.697
Take a good look at him.

21:04.731 --> 21:07.434
Has anyone seen him here?

21:07.467 --> 21:08.768
Do any of you know Ajani?

21:10.537 --> 21:12.905
I do.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.708
He cried when they took him
away from his sister.

21:15.742 --> 21:17.777
Who took him,
a man or a woman?

21:17.810 --> 21:20.613
I don't remember.
Many people came.

21:20.647 --> 21:23.583
They made us turn around

21:23.616 --> 21:28.421
and they looked at our hands
to see how strong we are.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.490
Look really hard, you guys.

21:30.523 --> 21:31.658
Huh? Try to remember.

21:31.691 --> 21:34.494
I know you can
help me out here.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.563
He was my friend.

21:36.596 --> 21:38.565
His bed was next to mine.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.700
Okay. What's your
name, sweetheart?

21:40.733 --> 21:42.369
Kwasi.

21:42.402 --> 21:43.670
This is really important, Kwasi.

21:43.703 --> 21:46.072
Can you tell me about the
person who took Ajani?

21:46.105 --> 21:47.840
He was very nice.

21:47.874 --> 21:49.909
He brought us candy.

21:49.942 --> 21:52.512
Was the man white
or was he black?

21:52.545 --> 21:53.780
White.

21:53.813 --> 21:54.914
And what did he say?

21:54.947 --> 21:56.649
He had magic powers,

21:56.683 --> 22:00.052
and he would bring us luck,
like Ajani's doll.

22:00.086 --> 22:01.688
What doll?

22:01.721 --> 22:03.723
Ajani brought it from home.

22:03.756 --> 22:05.425
The man liked it and said

22:05.458 --> 22:07.994
he would bring him lots
of dolls for good luck,

22:08.027 --> 22:09.829
if he would go with him.

22:09.862 --> 22:11.698
Okay.

22:11.731 --> 22:13.566
Good.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.034
Thank you.

22:15.067 --> 22:16.936
FIN:
The mastermind behind this

22:16.969 --> 22:17.837
left those kids there to die

22:17.870 --> 22:19.739
once he found out
Ajani was murdered.

22:19.772 --> 22:20.940
BCIS is debriefing
the kids,

22:20.973 --> 22:22.041
trying to track down

22:22.074 --> 22:22.942
the smugglers.

22:22.975 --> 22:24.611
This little boy give
you anything else

22:24.644 --> 22:25.812
on the guy who took Ajani?

22:25.845 --> 22:28.448
Kwasi only remembers that
he was a white guy with candy.

22:28.481 --> 22:30.750
FIN:
And by the way Ajani was
killed, whoever did it

22:30.783 --> 22:33.886
either knows Santeria
or is damn good at faking it.

22:35.955 --> 22:39.626
So, if the Santeria ritual is
a cover, what's it covering?

22:39.659 --> 22:42.795
Trafficking in kids isn't
just for sweatshop labor.

22:42.829 --> 22:45.798
It's also for sex.

22:45.832 --> 22:49.536
So you got a perv
who uses Ajani as a sex slave.

22:49.569 --> 22:50.703
He gets tired of him.

22:50.737 --> 22:52.739
He chops up the body to make
it look like a sacrifice,

22:52.772 --> 22:53.873
but also to get rid
of any evidence

22:53.906 --> 22:54.907
of sexual assault.

22:54.941 --> 22:56.843
He knew about Ajani's doll.

22:56.876 --> 22:59.946
He must've studied
African folklore.

22:59.979 --> 23:02.949
Go back to the
Santeria Center.

23:02.982 --> 23:04.851
We only asked Odufemi
about his members.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.686
See if he recalls
selling any candles

23:06.719 --> 23:07.687
to a white man.

23:07.720 --> 23:08.888
Fin, go visit Na'imah.

23:08.921 --> 23:10.457
That doll's
gotta mean something

23:10.457 --> 23:12.759
more than good luck.

23:14.594 --> 23:16.729
FIN:
What does the doll mean?

23:16.763 --> 23:19.198
It's not a doll;
it's an ikenga.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.968
My mother gave one to me
and one to Ajani

23:22.001 --> 23:24.871
to protect us
on our journey.

23:24.904 --> 23:28.741
She made the pouch herself so I
could wear it close to my heart.

23:28.775 --> 23:30.777
Did she make a pouch
for Ajani, too?

23:30.810 --> 23:31.878
Just like mine.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.546
Where'd she get the ikengas?

23:33.580 --> 23:35.181
My great-great-grandfather
carved them.

23:35.214 --> 23:36.949
See his mark?

23:36.983 --> 23:38.150
My mother says they

23:38.184 --> 23:41.020
look like brother
and sister.

23:41.053 --> 23:42.889
Are they taking good
care of you here?

23:42.922 --> 23:45.692
Yes. They said they'd put me
in a foster home

23:45.725 --> 23:46.959
as soon as they find one.

23:46.993 --> 23:49.896
But I want to go back
to my mother.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.898
We haven't found her yet.

23:51.931 --> 23:55.702
A neighbor said she went back
to Lagos to look for you.

23:56.703 --> 23:57.937
Take it.

23:57.970 --> 24:01.073
For good luck,
to help you find my mother.

24:05.645 --> 24:07.179
Santeria has
white followers
all over the city,

24:07.213 --> 24:09.549
but none in this
particular house.

24:09.582 --> 24:11.818
You're sure you didn't sell
any candles to a white man?

24:11.851 --> 24:13.620
Believe me,
I would've remembered.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.755
Anyone on your staff
who might've sold them?

24:18.725 --> 24:20.760
It's possible.

24:20.793 --> 24:24.163
We had a recent exhibit
of some local artists,

24:24.196 --> 24:25.965
and, uh, there were
a few white people

24:25.998 --> 24:27.166
who bought some carvings
and statues.

24:27.199 --> 24:28.968
Did any of them buy candles?

24:29.001 --> 24:31.070
Uh, I didn't make
any sales that day,

24:31.103 --> 24:32.572
but I will check.

24:36.008 --> 24:38.745
Here's someone who bought
two Senegalese statues

24:38.778 --> 24:41.080
and a box
of St. Cecelia candles.

24:41.113 --> 24:42.815
Name is Maggie Shaye.

24:46.018 --> 24:47.787
MAGGIE:
I buy a lot of
things, Detective.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.989
I'm always on the lookout for
interesting primitive art.

24:50.022 --> 24:51.791
Well, what about
those candles?

24:51.824 --> 24:52.725
Do you sell them here?

24:52.759 --> 24:56.095
No, I burned some here,
and some at home.

24:56.128 --> 24:58.598
They were cheap and
I like their scent.

24:58.631 --> 25:00.099
Why are you asking me
about my candles?

25:00.132 --> 25:01.601
You're just part of
an investigation.

25:01.634 --> 25:03.235
We're talking to dozens
of people who bought them.

25:03.269 --> 25:05.705
Uh... just
for the record,

25:05.738 --> 25:08.174
were you here
at the gallery
Monday or Tuesday?

25:08.207 --> 25:10.276
No, I was in Ghana
on a buying trip.

25:10.309 --> 25:12.211
Then I discovered a
fantastic new artist

25:12.244 --> 25:13.245
and cut my trip
short by a month.

25:13.279 --> 25:16.583
I've only been back
since late Tuesday night.

25:16.583 --> 25:18.317
I found this statue
on your desk.

25:18.350 --> 25:19.586
Can I buy it?

25:19.619 --> 25:20.587
I'm sorry, Detective,

25:20.620 --> 25:22.889
that's not for sale.

25:22.922 --> 25:25.157
The ikenga was a welcome-home
gift from my husband.

25:25.191 --> 25:25.958
FIN:
You know where he got it?

25:25.992 --> 25:27.059
MAGGIE:
125th Street Flea Market.

25:27.093 --> 25:29.762
Lots of Africans sell
their tribal objects there.

25:29.796 --> 25:31.698
Can I get
your husband's number?

25:31.731 --> 25:33.633
I know my wife would love
to have one of those.

25:33.666 --> 25:34.734
You can probably
reach Allan

25:34.767 --> 25:36.202
in his office.

25:36.235 --> 25:38.771
He teaches art
history at Hudson.

25:38.805 --> 25:39.972
ALLAN:
I don't understand.

25:41.107 --> 25:42.909
What would a present for my wife

25:42.942 --> 25:44.744
have to do with
a police investigation?

25:44.777 --> 25:47.113
Well, we really can't discuss
that right now.

25:47.146 --> 25:48.948
Do you know a lot
about African art?

25:48.981 --> 25:52.184
Actually, no, my specialty
is Tibetan sand paintings.

25:52.218 --> 25:54.253
BENSON:
But you knew how
valuable the doll was.

25:54.286 --> 25:58.725
I had no idea
till my wife told me.

25:58.758 --> 26:02.061
The man selling it said it was
some kind of tribal symbol.

26:02.094 --> 26:03.229
Would you recognize
this man?

26:03.262 --> 26:04.831
I think so.
I'd be glad to go with you

26:04.864 --> 26:06.232
to the flea market
next Saturday.

26:06.265 --> 26:08.868
I'm sure we'd find him.
Is that convenient for you?

26:08.901 --> 26:11.103
That'd be great.
We'd appreciate that.

26:11.137 --> 26:12.204
No problem.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.106
If this is about
smuggling antiquities,

26:14.140 --> 26:17.777
I feel strongly
it should be stopped.

26:17.810 --> 26:19.011
I'm active in the campaign

26:19.045 --> 26:22.314
to get the Elgin Marbles
back to Greece.

26:22.348 --> 26:24.751
"Elgin Marbles," my ass.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.352
This is our guy.
He's as slick as they come.

26:26.385 --> 26:27.854
Well, his wife was
away for two months,

26:27.887 --> 26:29.989
he figures he'll have some
fun, buy a boy for sex.

26:30.022 --> 26:31.257
Then his wife
calls and says,

26:31.290 --> 26:32.725
"Hi, honey, I'm coming home
tomorrow."

26:32.759 --> 26:33.826
FIN:
Shaye panics,

26:33.860 --> 26:34.894
has to get rid of Ajani,

26:34.927 --> 26:37.196
and he stages the Santeria
ritual to throw us off.

26:37.229 --> 26:38.898
STABLER:
The wife deals
in African art.

26:38.931 --> 26:39.899
He teaches art history.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.968
It's a short leap
to knowing about ikengas.

26:42.001 --> 26:43.335
See, what I don't get is,

26:43.369 --> 26:44.771
why didn't he just
throw the away the doll

26:44.804 --> 26:46.072
or leave it in the park
with the body?

26:46.105 --> 26:47.073
It's a trophy.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.841
He gets his rocks off
seeing his wife with it.

26:48.875 --> 26:51.043
Ajani's sister kept her doll
in a beaded pouch.

26:51.077 --> 26:52.378
Where's the pouch to this one?

26:52.411 --> 26:53.946
BENSON:
That's why God invented
search warrants.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.715
Those ikengas are going get us

26:55.748 --> 26:57.717
into Shaye's house
and his office.

27:00.086 --> 27:02.221
O'HALLORAN:
We've been over the floor,
the tub--

27:02.254 --> 27:04.123
everything.
Hit the light.

27:05.992 --> 27:07.159
That's all blood?

27:07.193 --> 27:08.294
No, bleach.

27:08.327 --> 27:10.429
This was all cleaned recently
and it was done well.

27:10.462 --> 27:11.698
Hold on.
This doesn't make sense.

27:11.698 --> 27:14.066
If there was blood here, it
should still be in the grout.

27:14.100 --> 27:15.868
Not necessarily.

27:15.902 --> 27:16.703
The grout's still fresh.

27:16.736 --> 27:18.838
Seal it with a
penetrating polymer,

27:18.871 --> 27:21.107
even blood won't
get through.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.108
Anything?

27:22.141 --> 27:23.710
Not a speck, not a hair.

27:23.743 --> 27:26.913
If Ajani was here,
we ain't gonna prove it.

27:26.946 --> 27:28.881
Stabler.
We got diddly. You?

27:28.915 --> 27:29.916
So far, zip.

27:29.949 --> 27:31.450
We'll keep you posted.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.152
The Rites of Santeria.

27:33.185 --> 27:35.087
Looks like the professor's
been doing his homework.

27:35.121 --> 27:38.324
I bet that's got a chapter
on ritual sacrifice.

27:38.357 --> 27:39.892
The security people
said you wanted

27:39.926 --> 27:41.360
the keys
to the filing cabinets?

27:41.393 --> 27:42.261
Thanks. Who're you?

27:42.294 --> 27:44.330
Professor Shaye's
research assistant.

27:44.363 --> 27:45.331
He'd want me to help you,

27:45.364 --> 27:47.233
if you'll just tell me
what you're looking for.

27:47.266 --> 27:48.735
A small beaded pouch.

27:48.768 --> 27:51.437
Blue fabric, red beads.

27:51.470 --> 27:54.373
Why didn't you say so?

27:54.406 --> 27:57.309
Dr. Shaye gave it
to me as a present.

27:57.343 --> 27:58.745
Well, where's Professor Shaye
right now?

27:58.778 --> 28:00.747
He's lecturing.

28:02.148 --> 28:04.350
In 990 A.D.,
when the Tangut Tibetans

28:04.383 --> 28:06.252
conquered western China,

28:06.285 --> 28:08.354
it was the beginning of a...

28:08.387 --> 28:11.357
of a... stunning leap
in their civilization

28:11.390 --> 28:14.326
and a fertile period in, uh...

28:14.360 --> 28:16.128
Sorry, Detectives, I'm
in the middle of a lecture.

28:16.162 --> 28:18.064
That's okay, you can
finish it in the car.

28:18.097 --> 28:22.802
Allan Shaye, you're under
arrest for the murder
of Ajani Haruna.

28:22.835 --> 28:24.070
You have the right
to remain silent.

28:24.103 --> 28:25.772
Anything you say
can and will

28:25.772 --> 28:27.940
be used against you
in a court of law.

28:27.974 --> 28:29.942
You have the right
to an attorney.

28:29.976 --> 28:31.310
If you cannot
afford one

28:31.343 --> 28:33.045
one will be
provided for you.

28:35.915 --> 28:36.816
I don't need a lawyer.

28:36.849 --> 28:38.484
I don't even know
why the hell I'm here.

28:38.517 --> 28:39.786
That's why you're here.

28:39.819 --> 28:40.987
The pouch?

28:41.020 --> 28:43.055
The ikenga I gave my wife
was in it.

28:43.089 --> 28:44.290
So what? That doesn't
prove anything.

28:44.323 --> 28:45.858
You keep thinking that way.

28:45.892 --> 28:48.094
Ajani's mother made that pouch.

28:48.127 --> 28:50.396
It's exactly like the one she
made for his sister's ikenga.

28:50.429 --> 28:52.064
Who's Ajani?

28:52.098 --> 28:53.966
The boy you murdered
and hacked to pieces.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.003
I told you, I got the statue and
the pouch from a street vendor.

28:57.036 --> 28:58.370
He must be your killer.

28:58.404 --> 29:00.239
Why aren't we out there
looking for him?

29:00.272 --> 29:03.810
So this is all just one
crazy cosmic coincidence.

29:03.810 --> 29:05.444
You just happened to buy
a tribal artifact

29:05.477 --> 29:07.379
like the one worn
by the dead boy's sister.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.348
Your wife buys a candle
like the one

29:09.381 --> 29:12.451
that was right next
to his body?

29:12.484 --> 29:15.554
Professor, I'm not that bright--

29:15.587 --> 29:18.524
you're the educated guy here--

29:18.557 --> 29:20.993
would you buy
that coincidence?
Yes...

29:21.027 --> 29:22.995
because that's what happened.

29:23.029 --> 29:24.363
Okay, smart-ass,
why don't you tell me

29:24.396 --> 29:26.332
why we found bleach
on every surface
of your house.

29:26.365 --> 29:28.100
I had a cleaning service in.
The place was filthy.

29:28.134 --> 29:29.435
With Ajani Haruna's blood.

29:29.468 --> 29:32.038
Actually... I wanted
to spruce things up

29:32.071 --> 29:32.972
because my wife was coming home.

29:33.005 --> 29:34.373
You think I wanted her
to find the place

29:34.406 --> 29:35.374
looking like a bachelor pad?

29:35.407 --> 29:37.176
( chair clattering )

29:37.209 --> 29:38.410
I'll tell you
what I think, pervert.

29:38.444 --> 29:41.480
I think your wife
surprised you

29:41.513 --> 29:44.216
by coming home early, so you had
to get rid of Ajani fast,

29:44.250 --> 29:46.218
but you couldn't risk just
dropping him off somewhere,

29:46.252 --> 29:48.154
because he might be able
to finger you,

29:48.187 --> 29:49.455
so you murdered him

29:49.488 --> 29:51.423
and you made it look like
a religious ritual.

29:53.893 --> 29:58.264
You can't hide from me
behind your fancy education.

29:58.297 --> 30:02.001
I smell you.

30:02.034 --> 30:03.002
You're nothing but a skell

30:03.035 --> 30:05.004
who gets his rocks off
screwing little boys.

30:09.175 --> 30:11.210
MAGGIE:
That's insane.

30:11.243 --> 30:13.212
He is not a child molester,

30:13.245 --> 30:15.014
and he is certainly
not a killer.

30:15.047 --> 30:16.348
You seem very sure
of that.

30:18.117 --> 30:21.120
Let me ask you a question.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.022
What do you make of these?

30:26.926 --> 30:29.996
One, your husband
gave to you,

30:30.029 --> 30:33.365
the other belongs to the sister
of the murdered boy.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.136
You're wrong. No.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.470
There could be
dozens of those.

30:40.139 --> 30:42.041
You really believe that?

30:43.509 --> 30:46.312
I mean, you're the expert,
right?

30:46.345 --> 30:47.880
Two statues.

30:47.914 --> 30:50.182
Same markings.

30:50.216 --> 30:53.052
Both carved
by the same person.

30:55.087 --> 30:58.057
Both in the same
handmade pouches...

31:01.060 --> 31:03.062
...made by
the children's mother.

31:05.264 --> 31:08.334
So they could carry around
their protectors.

31:15.141 --> 31:17.243
Monday evening,
I was in London

31:17.276 --> 31:18.610
when I called Allan.

31:18.644 --> 31:21.380
I told him I would be
coming home early.

31:21.413 --> 31:24.050
I thought
he would be happy.

31:24.083 --> 31:27.186
He snapped at me.

31:27.219 --> 31:28.520
He said I needed to
give him more notice.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.422
How was he was going to
get the house ready for me

31:30.456 --> 31:32.458
in just 12 hours.

31:35.727 --> 31:39.231
I asked him why he was so angry.

31:39.265 --> 31:41.300
He calmed down immediately,
apologized.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.402
But I couldn't
help thinking...

31:43.435 --> 31:45.171
Thinking what?

31:45.204 --> 31:46.305
That he was having

31:46.338 --> 31:49.241
an affair,
and I had interrupted them.

31:54.346 --> 31:56.315
Do you recognize these?

31:56.348 --> 31:57.416
The candle.

31:57.449 --> 32:00.719
It's like the ones I bought
at the Santeria Center

32:00.752 --> 32:04.223
before I left for Africa.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.993
I asked Allan why
one of them was missing

32:07.026 --> 32:09.261
and he said he used it--
and the bowls...

32:09.295 --> 32:10.729
And the bowls what?

32:10.762 --> 32:12.064
No...

32:12.098 --> 32:14.233
No, I can't. I can't.

32:14.266 --> 32:16.302
Maggie, if you don't

32:16.335 --> 32:19.638
help us now,
another child might die.

32:21.040 --> 32:23.242
( sobbing )

32:30.282 --> 32:32.751
When I called from London,

32:32.784 --> 32:36.055
Allan asked me where I put
the key to the storage room.

32:36.088 --> 32:39.225
I keep inventory there.
That's where the bowls were.

32:39.258 --> 32:41.260
And where is that room?

32:45.431 --> 32:47.499
In the basement...

32:47.533 --> 32:50.302
under the gallery.

32:51.703 --> 32:54.173
O'HALLORAN:
Detectives, I have
blood over here.

32:54.206 --> 32:54.940
FIN:
You sure?

32:55.041 --> 32:57.609
This time,
I doubt it's bleach.

32:57.643 --> 33:00.212
MUNCH:
Looks like we
got a trail.

33:00.246 --> 33:02.248
FIN:
Leads over to that crate.

33:04.150 --> 33:05.784
MUNCH:
"Ship to Allan Shaye,

33:05.817 --> 33:08.420
Tibetan Research Center,
Katmandu, Nepal."

33:10.389 --> 33:12.224
I hope this isn't
what I think it is.

33:16.362 --> 33:17.729
Fancy box.

33:22.468 --> 33:24.070
( heavy sigh )

33:24.103 --> 33:25.537
Call a medical examiner.

33:29.708 --> 33:31.477
How much longer are you
going to hold me?

33:31.510 --> 33:32.611
You'll be leaving soon.

33:32.644 --> 33:33.712
For Death Row.

33:35.547 --> 33:38.084
Your wife tells us
this is a Moroccan tile box.

33:38.084 --> 33:39.718
She bought it from a family

33:39.751 --> 33:41.620
in Marrakesh.

33:41.653 --> 33:43.755
Look familiar?

33:46.425 --> 33:48.094
Sorry we couldn't
ship it to Tibet for you.

33:48.094 --> 33:49.795
CRAGEN:
I'd like you to meet

33:49.828 --> 33:52.431
Assistant District
Attorney Novak.

33:52.464 --> 33:54.133
You got two choices.

33:54.166 --> 33:58.604
Cooperate, you spend the rest
of your life in prison.

33:58.637 --> 34:01.573
Don't, you die
by lethal injection.

34:04.476 --> 34:06.745
Am I supposed to be intimidated?

34:06.778 --> 34:11.117
Nobody's been executed
in New York State for 40 years.

34:11.150 --> 34:12.618
NOVAK:
You're right.

34:12.651 --> 34:15.654
But given your crime,
I bet a jury would be willing

34:15.687 --> 34:17.123
to break with tradition.

34:17.156 --> 34:20.559
So, go ahead,
Professor Shaye--

34:20.592 --> 34:21.727
gamble.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.662
It's your life.

34:23.695 --> 34:25.197
You want to see what's inside?

34:29.201 --> 34:31.503
I'll cooperate.

34:32.538 --> 34:34.140
Why did you do this?

34:34.140 --> 34:35.641
I could hardly risk

34:35.674 --> 34:38.210
having body parts floating up
in the East River.

34:38.244 --> 34:39.145
And it would have

34:39.145 --> 34:41.380
ruined your Santeria scam, too,
right?

34:41.413 --> 34:43.149
NOVAK:
How did you find Ajani?

34:43.149 --> 34:45.151
Through a guy called Bosuh.

34:45.151 --> 34:45.884
CRAGEN:
Who is he?

34:45.917 --> 34:48.254
He calls himself a facilitator.

34:48.287 --> 34:52.458
Greases the wheels so people
can ship things internationally.

34:52.491 --> 34:53.525
NOVAK:
Things.

34:53.559 --> 34:54.526
You mean children.

34:54.560 --> 34:55.894
CRAGEN:
How do you get in touch

34:55.927 --> 34:57.596
with this Bosuh?
By cell phone.

34:57.629 --> 34:58.864
I can give you his number.

34:58.897 --> 35:00.766
The number's no good,
there's no deal.

35:00.799 --> 35:01.767
It's good.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.402
I talked to him last week.

35:03.435 --> 35:06.305
He said he had a new shipment
coming tomorrow.

35:08.640 --> 35:09.775
Martin Bosuh.

35:09.808 --> 35:13.179
VCIS has him as a Nigerian
citizen,

35:13.179 --> 35:15.281
currently in
the United States
on a work visa.

35:15.314 --> 35:16.548
Comes and goes
about once a month.

35:16.582 --> 35:17.916
Interpol's got him
on their radar--

35:17.949 --> 35:19.017
slaves, drugs,
black market stuff.

35:19.050 --> 35:21.820
We checked the cell number--
working prepaid cell.

35:21.853 --> 35:22.688
Untraceable.

35:22.721 --> 35:24.890
We'd better have a plan
before we dial.

35:24.923 --> 35:26.725
MUNCH:
This guy left
a dozen kids

35:26.758 --> 35:28.294
locked up to starve to death.

35:28.327 --> 35:30.196
He's got to know
the heat is on.

35:30.229 --> 35:31.663
I think the only way we're going
to get this guy

35:31.697 --> 35:32.564
is if we try to buy a child.

35:32.598 --> 35:34.333
And if we send you
and Elliot in there,

35:34.366 --> 35:36.502
he's going to smell cop
before you get to the door.

35:36.535 --> 35:40.372
Well, he may not suspect
somebody from his own country.

35:46.478 --> 35:47.513
Mr. and Mrs. Robinson--

35:47.546 --> 35:49.515
what exactly are
you looking for?

35:49.548 --> 35:50.682
FIN:
My wife wants a girl

35:50.716 --> 35:53.385
who can cook,
clean and keep house.

35:53.419 --> 35:55.554
I cannot stand
American servants.

35:55.587 --> 35:59.458
They steal, they lie,
they do not know their place.

35:59.491 --> 36:02.628
And my husband's business
requires discretion.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.363
I understand.

36:04.396 --> 36:07.599
MABUDA
She must be
respectful,

36:07.633 --> 36:11.237
quiet, but above all,
she must be obedient.

36:11.237 --> 36:13.239
That is most important.

36:13.239 --> 36:15.941
Do you have what
we're looking for?

36:15.974 --> 36:16.875
I may.

36:16.908 --> 36:22.481
What business
are you in, Mr. Robinson?

36:22.514 --> 36:23.749
My business.

36:23.782 --> 36:27.486
Your husband is a man
of few words.

36:27.519 --> 36:30.389
How long have you been married?

36:31.690 --> 36:33.492
Seven years.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.961
Yes, seven years.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.598
May I suggest,

36:39.631 --> 36:43.369
perhaps you would like
a younger girl,

36:43.402 --> 36:46.672
one you can train
to your liking.

36:46.705 --> 36:49.375
A five- or six-year-old.

36:54.746 --> 36:57.549
Deal.

37:00.752 --> 37:05.691
Excuse me a moment
while I make the arrangements.

37:09.728 --> 37:10.796
We're blown.

37:10.829 --> 37:12.764
Wait right here.

37:18.670 --> 37:19.838
Hey!

37:21.807 --> 37:23.575
Stop! Police!

37:32.784 --> 37:34.786
They were kids,
you sick son of a bitch!

37:38.790 --> 37:41.793
Fin! Fin!

37:41.827 --> 37:43.862
Enough, enough, enough, enough.

37:43.895 --> 37:45.697
Off, off him.

37:48.500 --> 37:51.770
Martin Bosuh,
you're under arrest

37:51.803 --> 37:53.339
for kidnapping
in the first degree.

37:53.372 --> 37:54.473
Turn around.

37:56.442 --> 37:57.943
Tell us where
the children are,

37:57.976 --> 38:00.679
and maybe the judge will
take that into consideration.

38:00.712 --> 38:01.813
I have nothing to say.

38:01.847 --> 38:03.782
You'll be doing ten years
for each kid

38:03.815 --> 38:05.551
you left to die
in that warehouse.

38:05.584 --> 38:08.053
I don't think so.
I have this to bargain with.

38:08.086 --> 38:10.622
STABLER:
You fell fleeing
from the police.

38:10.656 --> 38:11.690
Please, Detective.

38:11.723 --> 38:14.593
Another African man,
brutalized by a vicious cop?

38:14.626 --> 38:16.828
I don't think
your Police Commissioner

38:16.862 --> 38:18.364
wants more bad publicity.

38:18.364 --> 38:21.500
You've come
to beat me again.

38:21.533 --> 38:24.970
I am not afraid of you.

38:25.003 --> 38:26.905
You should be afraid of her.

38:26.938 --> 38:28.106
What can a woman do?

38:28.139 --> 38:29.541
Claw my eyes out?

38:29.575 --> 38:30.609
( chuckles )

38:30.642 --> 38:32.077
MABUDA:
Deport you.

38:32.110 --> 38:34.380
Your passport's been revoked.

38:34.380 --> 38:37.115
BENSON:
Meet Nigerian
Under-Consul Kema Mabuda.

38:37.148 --> 38:39.117
I have a few friends home
in Nigeria.

38:39.150 --> 38:41.687
Perhaps it is time I paid
them a visit.

38:41.720 --> 38:42.821
Have them visit you.

38:42.854 --> 38:46.725
At Kirikiri Prison, while you
await your execution.

38:46.758 --> 38:48.927
BENSON:
They use a firing squad
there, right?

38:48.960 --> 38:51.397
FIN:
Yeah, and the warden thinks
that's too easy,

38:51.430 --> 38:52.698
So he ties you to a pole,

38:52.731 --> 38:53.765
in the boiling sun.

38:53.799 --> 38:56.067
Then he has his firing squad
start at your ankles

38:56.101 --> 38:57.903
and work their way up
real slow.

38:57.936 --> 39:00.406
STABLER:
How soon can we
get him on a plane?

39:03.642 --> 39:07.413
If I tell you
what you want to know?

39:07.446 --> 39:11.883
I'll ask for leniency.

39:16.722 --> 39:20.659
There is a truck
arriving tonight.

39:33.171 --> 39:35.441
( sirens wailing )

39:42.581 --> 39:43.982
Police!
Get out of the truck

39:44.015 --> 39:45.684
and put your hands
in the air! Now!

39:47.586 --> 39:49.555
Come on, out of the cab.

39:51.690 --> 39:52.691
Now.
Get down, come on!

39:52.724 --> 39:53.859
Get away from the truck.

39:56.562 --> 39:58.564
Let's open her up.

40:08.206 --> 40:10.976
It's okay.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.881
Come ahead.
We're not going

40:15.914 --> 40:17.082
to hurt you guys.

40:17.115 --> 40:18.684
We're the police.

40:18.717 --> 40:20.051
Come on.

40:24.956 --> 40:26.458
Come ahead.

40:45.511 --> 40:47.779
Get Children's Services.

41:04.663 --> 41:06.064
Take good care of them.

41:06.097 --> 41:08.166
They're a long way from home.
