00:36.370 --> 00:40.091
I'm gonna kill you, Weinselstein!

00:55.180 --> 00:56.853
- Twerp.
- Unh!

00:57.808 --> 01:00.812
Why you running away, Weinselstein?
I got you a birthday present.

01:00.978 --> 01:03.151
That's okay.
You didn't have to get anything.

01:03.313 --> 01:05.816
I got you some bark.
And you're gonna eat it.

01:07.192 --> 01:09.661
- Cool. I was gonna eat bark anyway.
- No, you weren't.

01:09.820 --> 01:13.870
Yeah. See? All the things you were gonna do
to me, I was already planning on doing.

01:15.242 --> 01:17.336
Mm. Mm, so good.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.668
Yummy. Unh!

01:20.831 --> 01:23.175
- You planning on not being able to breathe?
- Yes.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.962
Listen to me, Weinselstein.
Nobody likes you.

01:27.129 --> 01:30.053
Nobody will ever like you.
Do you understand that?

01:30.215 --> 01:31.933
Come on. Let's split.

01:32.175 --> 01:33.802
Goodbye, loser.

02:01.163 --> 02:03.382
Mom? I'm home.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.336
Mom?

02:11.757 --> 02:13.851
<i>Happy birthday, little man.</i>

02:14.009 --> 02:18.560
<i>I had to work a double shift again,
but I love you very much. Mom.</i>

02:18.722 --> 02:23.853
<i>P. S. Dinner is in the fridge, and I got you
your favorite cake. It's on the counter.</i>

02:26.271 --> 02:30.026
<i>Combine the mix with two tablespoons
of oil and two eggs.</i>

02:30.192 --> 02:33.571
<i>We're out of eggs,
so you'll need to run out and get them.</i>

02:33.904 --> 02:35.577
<i>Preheat the oven to 350...</i>

02:35.739 --> 02:40.870
<i>...grease and flour a 9 " x 13" cake pan
and then pour the batter into the pan.</i>

02:42.245 --> 02:44.213
<i>Careful not to spill.</i>

03:27.457 --> 03:31.303
<i>Hello, my young friends.
I'm Rance Holloway.</i>

03:31.461 --> 03:33.805
<i>You've probably seen me
on The Merv Griffin Show...</i>

03:33.964 --> 03:35.511
<i>...or live onstage...</i>

03:35.674 --> 03:39.599
<i>...at the fabulous Stardust Resort and Casino
in Las Vegas.</i>

03:39.761 --> 03:44.187
<i>That's where I perform such tricks
as "Skateboarding Ghost"...</i>

03:44.349 --> 03:46.602
<i>..."The Amazing Cordless Telephone"...</i>

03:46.768 --> 03:50.113
<i>...and my very famous
"Mouth Birds" illusion.</i>

03:56.486 --> 03:57.533
Wow.

03:59.614 --> 04:02.538
<i>Did you like that? Of course you did.</i>

04:02.701 --> 04:05.875
<i>That trick just blew your mind,
because that's what magic does.</i>

04:06.079 --> 04:07.831
<i>It blows people's minds.</i>

04:07.998 --> 04:10.968
<i>Welcome to the amazing world
of magic.</i>

04:11.126 --> 04:14.721
<i>A world where you can astonish
and enchant those around you.</i>

04:14.880 --> 04:17.178
<i>Because everyone loves a magician.</i>

04:17.673 --> 04:21.519
<i>And if you follow my instructions,
they'll love you too.</i>

04:22.512 --> 04:24.890
<i>Let's begin now with a simple illusion...</i>

04:25.056 --> 04:27.935
<i>...where we pull pennies out of our nose.</i>

04:43.533 --> 04:44.830
Alakazam!

04:44.993 --> 04:48.213
- How'd you do that?
- A magician never tells his secrets.

04:48.371 --> 04:51.841
- Oh. Okay.
- It's a rubber thumb.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.377
Oh, cool!

04:53.543 --> 04:55.921
- I'm Anthony Mertz.
- Albert Weinselstein.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.387
You're that kid who's always in the
nurse's office, right?

04:59.549 --> 05:02.723
Not always.
Sometimes they send me to the hospital.

05:02.886 --> 05:04.058
What are those for?

05:04.554 --> 05:08.525
This one's for my allergies,
and this one's for my asthma.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.230
And this is testosterone.

05:10.393 --> 05:13.067
My doctor says I'm dangerously close
to being a girl.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.576
Do you know any other tricks?

05:17.734 --> 05:19.862
I have a whole magic kit at home.

05:22.113 --> 05:23.535
Behold.

05:23.698 --> 05:27.419
An empty top hat. Perfectly normal.

05:29.621 --> 05:31.464
Alakazam!

05:31.957 --> 05:35.211
Wow. You're like a boy witch.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.257
Thank you.

05:37.754 --> 05:42.635
Hey. What if you put a plastic bag
of water in the hidden compartment?

05:42.801 --> 05:45.520
Then water would come out
instead of confetti.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.353
- Do you wanna be my partner?
- More than anything.

05:48.515 --> 05:51.610
Okay. I think we should start
writing down our trick ideas.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.236
- Like in a notebook.
- Yes.

05:53.395 --> 05:56.319
An enchanted notebook,
with leather and buckles.

05:56.481 --> 05:59.109
- All I have is a regular notebook.
- That'll work.

05:59.276 --> 06:04.123
So then our first trick
should be "Confetti Out of a Hat."

06:21.006 --> 06:22.633
- Awesome.
- Ta-da.

06:59.461 --> 07:01.509
<i>Incredible. Incredible.</i>

07:04.507 --> 07:09.980
Burt. Burt. I want you to come work for me.
Here, at Bally's.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.811
Ah! Heh.

07:11.973 --> 07:13.896
But I need you to do one thing for me.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.527
I need you to dump Anton.

07:15.685 --> 07:18.029
He's... Well, he's homely.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.357
No offense.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.275
None taken.

07:23.026 --> 07:25.370
I'm sorry, Doug. Anton and I are a team.

07:26.363 --> 07:29.913
Always have been, always will be.

07:33.036 --> 07:35.414
Fair enough. Welcome to Bally's, boys.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.624
Congratulations.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.235
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

08:05.402 --> 08:08.281
<i>The Incredible Burt and Anton!</i>

08:11.074 --> 08:15.124
<i>Abra, abracabadbra</i>

08:15.787 --> 08:17.209
<i>I wanna reach out and grab ya</i>

08:17.372 --> 08:20.251
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm Burt Wonderstone.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.090
And I'm Anton Marvelton.

08:22.252 --> 08:25.472
But, of course, you already knew that.

08:25.922 --> 08:29.392
<i>Abra, abracadabra</i>

08:29.801 --> 08:32.770
<i>I wanna reach out and grab ya</i>

08:32.929 --> 08:36.479
<i>Abra, abracadabra</i>

08:38.101 --> 08:39.568
<i>Abracadabra</i>

08:43.063 --> 08:45.192
What you may not know
is that Burt and I...

08:45.358 --> 08:48.828
...have been magical friends and partners
since we were young boys.

08:48.987 --> 08:52.662
We always knew there was something
a little bit different about our friendship.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.918
Remember our games of Hangman, Burt?

08:55.076 --> 08:58.922
I sure do, Anton. But we didn't play it
quite the way the other kids did.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.799
Ladies and gentlemen,
our beautiful assistant, Nicole.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.640
Hold on, hold on, hold on, Anton.

09:16.848 --> 09:19.271
We're here to do magic, not Nicole.

09:20.643 --> 09:21.940
Right now, it's time for:

09:23.354 --> 09:25.027
- "Hangman."
- "Hangman."

10:36.553 --> 10:38.021
And that's why we call it:

10:38.179 --> 10:40.432
- A magical friendship.
- A magical friendship.

10:40.598 --> 10:43.898
<i>Abra, abracadabra</i>

10:45.562 --> 10:48.406
Night after night after night,
I am in magic hell.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.738
Could you take any more time
making the switch?

10:50.900 --> 10:53.904
- I'm standing under that cloak like an asshole.
- Give me a break.

10:54.070 --> 10:57.574
I've been doing the switch the same way
I've done it for the last 10 years.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.117
You're just impatient.

10:59.284 --> 11:02.959
I am impatient, Anton, because I have
to share a cloak with a sweaty walrus-man.

11:03.121 --> 11:05.294
You just want to get the show over with.

11:05.456 --> 11:08.084
Could we get a towel for him, please?
Dab it down.

11:08.251 --> 11:10.299
- I sweat because I work hard.
- Take my phone!

11:10.461 --> 11:13.590
You think it's easy securing
your safety harness in the dark?

11:13.756 --> 11:16.475
Would you rather I let the noose
just snap your neck off?

11:16.634 --> 11:18.728
Can we do one show
without this bitch-fest?

11:18.887 --> 11:21.936
I'm sorry. Are we hurting your
performance as a walking mannequin?

11:22.098 --> 11:24.772
- That's it. You know what? I qu...
- You quit? You quit?

11:24.934 --> 11:26.694
- I qui... I qui...
- You quit? You quit?

11:26.811 --> 11:27.858
You quit?

11:28.021 --> 11:30.274
- Ugh! I quit!
- Go get a job at Cirque du So-lame.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.660
- That's the second one this month.
- Not like they're hard to replace.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.115
Case in point. You.

11:35.278 --> 11:36.325
- What? Sorry?
- Yes.

11:36.487 --> 11:37.830
- What's your name?
- Oh. Jane.

11:37.989 --> 11:40.208
- You know the tricks?
- Yes. You need something?

11:40.366 --> 11:42.915
- Thirty seconds till "The Burt Locker."
- You're Nicole.

11:43.077 --> 11:46.627
Oh, wow. Mr. Wonderstone.
That is a tremendous honor.

11:46.789 --> 11:49.508
I don't think I'm ready to take on that.
I'm not rehearsed.

11:49.667 --> 11:52.295
I would need several years of...
That is not an outfit.

11:52.503 --> 11:54.301
Mr. Marvelton, this may be a bad idea.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.717
- You're gonna be great.
- I'm terrified of crowds.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.883
- Don't worry.
- You have no idea. I have a fear...

11:58.927 --> 12:01.271
Agh, that is tight. Ugh.

12:01.429 --> 12:04.182
- What? She has no ribs.
- Ugh!

12:04.807 --> 12:05.854
You took her hair.

12:06.017 --> 12:09.521
<i>Abra, abracadabra</i>

12:10.772 --> 12:13.116
You know, folks,
when you grow up as a magician...

12:13.274 --> 12:16.778
...the first escape you learn
is generally from a school locker.

12:18.404 --> 12:19.826
The jocks hated us...

12:19.989 --> 12:22.833
...because we always stole
their girlfriends away from them...

12:22.992 --> 12:25.336
...using the power of magic!

13:15.211 --> 13:17.009
- I like the blond.
- Oh, thanks.

13:17.171 --> 13:19.014
- Makes you look cute.
- Thanks.

13:19.966 --> 13:22.515
So I finally got this new bed that I ordered.

13:22.677 --> 13:24.679
What?
Sorry, I'm just trying to concentrate.

13:24.846 --> 13:25.893
Behind you.

13:27.890 --> 13:31.736
It's an octuple king. Biggest bed in Vegas.
Easily sleeps two dozen adults.

13:31.894 --> 13:35.398
If the phone rings and I'm on the other
side of the bed, I can't get to it.

13:35.565 --> 13:36.782
There's no way. Sword.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.409
Ahh! God, that was close.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.079
The point is, it's a huge bed.

13:44.115 --> 13:46.868
And I was wondering,
would you like to see it tonight...

13:47.035 --> 13:48.082
...nakedly?

13:48.995 --> 13:50.622
Oh, I don't think that's a good idea...

13:50.788 --> 13:53.587
- ...since we just started working together...
- Listen, Nicole.

13:53.750 --> 13:54.967
- It's Jane.
- Sword.

13:56.461 --> 13:59.761
I know this is your first show
and it's all very new and fresh and exciting...

13:59.922 --> 14:02.425
...but when you have done this 5000 times...

14:02.592 --> 14:05.436
...you'll find that having sex with me
is the only way...

14:05.595 --> 14:09.600
...to mitigate the miserable drudgery
of your existence.

14:10.641 --> 14:14.271
- My point is this. Let's just have sex.
- It's not gonna happen.

14:14.437 --> 14:17.236
- You a lesbian?
- Is every woman who doesn't sleep with you...

14:17.398 --> 14:19.947
- ...a lesbian?
- Mm, no. I've slept with plenty of lesbians.

14:22.236 --> 14:26.457
Wow. I've worshiped you for 10 years and
you've just made me hate you in 60 seconds.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.960
Hmm. Right there.

14:41.422 --> 14:44.676
Looks like I'm the one
who scored this time, you dumb jock!

14:54.977 --> 14:57.651
Ladies and gentlemen,
our most famous illusion.

14:57.814 --> 15:00.613
- You know where we're going with this one.
- One we call:

15:00.775 --> 15:04.871
- "Man Head/Lady Body."
- "Man Head/Lady Body."

15:05.029 --> 15:06.497
Right!

15:06.656 --> 15:09.000
All right, here we go. Here we go.

15:09.158 --> 15:12.833
In order to accomplish
this impossible feat of impossibility...

15:12.995 --> 15:16.340
...we are going to need a female volunteer
from the audience.

15:16.499 --> 15:19.719
Female volunteer.
Let's see who we have.

15:19.877 --> 15:21.129
Anyone? Anyone?

15:21.295 --> 15:26.643
Who will it be for "Man Head/Lady Body"?

15:26.801 --> 15:28.394
Ahh.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.223
Would you care to join me onstage?

15:33.307 --> 15:35.560
How about a round of applause?

15:40.773 --> 15:44.198
Mm.

15:44.944 --> 15:48.414
I can't believe I'm really making out
with Burt Wonderstone.

15:48.573 --> 15:51.577
This must be the thrill of a lifetime for you.

15:51.742 --> 15:54.370
Your place is so beautiful.

15:54.537 --> 15:56.756
This is not my place.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.001
This is my place.

16:00.168 --> 16:03.092
Oh, my God!

16:03.713 --> 16:07.138
- Oh, my God. It's so beautiful.
- Yes, it is.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.893
- Look at you!
- Look at me.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.725
- Oh, my God, look at your costume!
- Yes, yes.

16:11.888 --> 16:12.935
Posters.

16:15.141 --> 16:18.065
Oh, my God! There you are!

16:18.227 --> 16:20.025
- And here I am.
- Aw.

16:20.188 --> 16:23.283
Yes. Come with me, please.

16:23.774 --> 16:24.900
Ah.

16:25.067 --> 16:28.947
Would you do me a kindness
and jump up on the bench, please?

16:29.113 --> 16:34.040
Legs facing that way,
arms as if you're holding a giant pumpkin.

16:35.203 --> 16:36.420
Good.

16:36.579 --> 16:39.753
So, Miranda,
what are your hopes and dreams?

16:39.916 --> 16:42.760
Well, I'd really like
to own my own hair salons.

16:42.919 --> 16:45.422
That's great. You're interesting.
Follow me, please.

16:45.588 --> 16:49.309
There will be no biting or scratching,
anything that can leave a mark.

16:49.467 --> 16:53.267
This is a standard release form
acknowledging that you are over 18...

16:53.429 --> 16:57.400
...and that you are willingly consenting
to the sex acts that we are about to commit.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.435
It's a lot of paperwork.

16:59.936 --> 17:02.610
- It's a lot of sex acts.
- Mm.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.984
Oh, my God! It's huge!

17:07.443 --> 17:09.616
Biggest bed in Vegas.

17:45.189 --> 17:49.319
Hey, ahem, Jimbo! Hey, there you go.
Sprinkle the infield there.

17:49.485 --> 17:52.364
You've done such a great job today.

17:52.530 --> 17:56.535
I just want to reward you for your
excellent service with this $100 bill.

17:56.701 --> 17:59.625
You're just gonna turn it
into a $1 bill when I take it.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.500
I don't know where that's coming from.
Who would do that?

18:03.666 --> 18:07.011
That's mean. A $1 bill is a horrible tip.

18:07.169 --> 18:10.298
I'm giving you $100.

18:12.133 --> 18:13.259
Heh.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.394
Oh, my gosh. You got me again.

18:15.553 --> 18:17.772
Yes, I did. You never learn.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.056
- He never learns.
- Agh.

18:19.223 --> 18:20.349
I'm sorry.

18:20.516 --> 18:23.190
Hey, Jim, I think you've got something
in your pocket.

18:25.396 --> 18:26.693
Thank you, Mr. Marvelton.

18:28.482 --> 18:29.529
Oh.

18:29.692 --> 18:30.864
Look who's here.

18:31.027 --> 18:32.279
Bun?

18:32.445 --> 18:35.324
Anton. Lucius Belvedere.
Rick the implausible.

18:35.489 --> 18:36.957
This is a rare treat.

18:37.116 --> 18:40.746
I can't remember the last time
I saw you two together offstage.

18:41.412 --> 18:43.039
We're both busy, that's all.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.424
We see each other every day.

18:47.043 --> 18:49.637
- So how's the show going?
- Not so good. Good.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.047
Pretty good. It's okay.

18:51.464 --> 18:56.265
I'm in the lobby doing the 2 to 2:30 shift.
Wednesdays through...

18:56.427 --> 18:58.896
Well, just Wednesdays.
Plus I'm doing some webisodes.

18:59.055 --> 19:01.774
- Drum up business that way.
- What the hell is a webisode?

19:01.932 --> 19:06.938
Are you being serious? What's a webis...?
It's a show that you do on the Internet.

19:07.104 --> 19:10.574
It's just like being on TV or having a movie
except you don't go through...

19:10.733 --> 19:13.407
...you know, all the hassle
of people seeing it.

19:14.362 --> 19:15.614
What happened to your hand?

19:15.780 --> 19:19.751
Oh, one of my Bengal tigers
has been getting a little bitey lately.

19:20.409 --> 19:23.037
That's why I'm a comedy magician,
not a big cat magician.

19:23.204 --> 19:26.299
I want to kill onstage,
not have some tiger rip my hand...

19:26.457 --> 19:28.676
I don't want to get killed. I want to kill on...

19:28.876 --> 19:30.469
You know what? Just forget it.

19:30.628 --> 19:31.800
- It's tough.
- It is tough.

19:31.962 --> 19:34.260
- It is tough.
- It was funny in my head.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.767
If I spend more than an hour away
from my cats...

19:36.926 --> 19:38.928
...they forget who I am and attack me.

19:39.095 --> 19:40.938
Sounds like my wife and kids.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.816
If, you know, by "wife and kids"
I meant my ferrets.

19:44.642 --> 19:47.771
You know, if I had a wife and kids
and wasn't just home alone.

19:49.313 --> 19:52.112
- What's going on out there?
- Eating Popsicle after Popsicle.

19:52.274 --> 19:56.279
I don't know, we should probably go check it
out. Like, as a group? Bunch of friends?

20:07.415 --> 20:10.089
Appreciate it.
You seem like an open-minded crowd.

20:10.251 --> 20:13.972
Things are about to happen here that may
be difficult for many of you to process.

20:14.130 --> 20:18.431
If you're at all squeamish, I encourage you
to take shelter inside the casinos.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.139
Move along.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.436
Or just turn it off.

20:25.975 --> 20:27.693
I'll give you a moment.

20:35.151 --> 20:38.155
Congratulations.
You are truly brave.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.324
I only hope you're ready to face the fire!

20:43.743 --> 20:44.869
Get it off! Get off!

20:45.369 --> 20:48.168
He totally nailed you with that fireball, man.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.298
Sorry. Guilty pleasure.

20:51.333 --> 20:54.507
You're a really good sport.
Whatever that means.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.674
- Would you like to help me with a trick?
- Sure.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.137
Now he done it.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.145
Who is this hot mess?

21:10.311 --> 21:12.530
That's Steve Gray, the street magician.

21:12.688 --> 21:15.191
That guy's a magician?
He doesn't even have a costume.

21:15.357 --> 21:18.782
Pick a card.
Show it to the crowd and that whole deal.

21:19.695 --> 21:22.369
Now take the marker from your pocket...

21:23.073 --> 21:25.326
...and write your mother's name on that card.

21:25.493 --> 21:26.995
But I don't have a...

21:27.369 --> 21:29.212
Oh, snap!

21:29.997 --> 21:31.294
What's with all the cameras?

21:31.457 --> 21:34.381
Oh, he's shooting his cable show,
<i>Steve Gray: Brain Rapist.</i>

21:35.085 --> 21:36.712
- "Brain Rapist"?
- Yeah.

21:36.879 --> 21:38.552
You live in a bubble or something?

21:38.714 --> 21:40.091
Come on, come on, come on.

21:40.257 --> 21:43.852
Dorothy. His mother's name is Dorothy.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.058
Pretty name.

21:45.554 --> 21:49.309
I'm gonna take Dorothy,
slide her into the center of the deck...

21:49.517 --> 21:51.565
...and put her back in my pocket.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.563
Now punch me in the face.

21:54.772 --> 21:57.571
- What?
- Punch me in the face. Hard as you can.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.373
- I'm not gonna do that.
- Of course.

21:59.485 --> 22:03.240
Sometimes the roles we're forced
to play in life are difficult to understand.

22:03.405 --> 22:06.033
Like your mother, Dorothy...

22:06.200 --> 22:10.046
...who, for the good of sailors everywhere,
lived the life of a whore.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.422
Whorethy. That's what they called her.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.087
Surrender, Whorethy.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.298
You're not in Kansas anymore, Whorethy.

22:20.881 --> 22:22.758
- No, no, no.
- Jesus.

22:22.925 --> 22:25.974
- Is that guy a plant?
- That looked like a real punch.

22:28.556 --> 22:29.773
It's okay!

22:29.932 --> 22:31.229
I've already forgiven him.

22:31.684 --> 22:34.779
I provoked him
and awakened his pain body.

22:37.731 --> 22:39.984
- Oh.
- Wow.

22:40.150 --> 22:42.278
That's swelling up pretty quick.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.413
I better let the pressure off.

22:54.582 --> 22:55.629
Better.

22:55.791 --> 22:58.044
Ha-ha-ha. Wait.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.338
Feels like there's something in there.

23:02.756 --> 23:03.803
Let me just...

23:09.763 --> 23:11.015
One!

23:11.181 --> 23:12.808
Two!

23:12.975 --> 23:14.818
Three!

23:14.977 --> 23:17.105
Daddy!

23:20.733 --> 23:22.155
I wonder what this could be.

23:27.990 --> 23:29.333
It's the card!

23:29.491 --> 23:30.538
Oh, that's nuts!

23:30.701 --> 23:32.703
As it was in the beginning...

23:33.662 --> 23:35.790
...so shall it be in the end.

23:38.208 --> 23:39.676
I tried to warn them.

23:42.296 --> 23:43.843
That's it.

23:47.176 --> 23:49.019
That's crazy, man!

23:50.012 --> 23:52.606
Go! Go!

24:00.147 --> 24:02.900
Hello. I haven't seen you around.

24:03.067 --> 24:05.866
I don't believe I have had the pleasure.

24:08.530 --> 24:12.251
We caught your thing out on the street...

24:12.952 --> 24:16.377
...and it was disgusting.
But pretty good.

24:16.538 --> 24:19.382
Good. Bad.

24:21.377 --> 24:22.879
I don't eat from that tree.

24:24.546 --> 24:27.390
Hey, any chance I can get you
to sign something for me?

24:27.549 --> 24:31.270
Oh, well, I don't usually sign autographs,
but I suppose I can make an exception.

24:31.428 --> 24:33.055
It's a release form.

24:33.222 --> 24:37.944
Just in case we caught you in the background.
I don't want to have to pixelate your face.

24:38.185 --> 24:39.562
Mm.

24:39.728 --> 24:42.902
- Do I need to sign a release form?
- No, I can pixelate your face.

24:45.275 --> 24:48.449
So, anywho,
we have a show over at Bally's...

24:48.612 --> 24:52.082
...and I could get you some comps,
if you'd like to take a look at our act.

24:52.741 --> 24:55.335
We do this one trick, it's a man's head...

24:55.494 --> 24:57.212
I tell you what.

24:58.247 --> 25:01.251
Pretend I'm still here and tell me all about it.

25:16.098 --> 25:18.442
<i>From Chicago</i>, Brain Rapist.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.820
<i>The world record for staring was 24 hours.</i>

25:22.104 --> 25:25.483
<i>But I've been doing it for over three
days now and, frankly, I'm bored.</i>

25:26.525 --> 25:29.369
<i>So I'm gonna spice things up
with a little pepper spray.</i>

25:29.528 --> 25:31.075
<i>Bring it.</i>

25:38.746 --> 25:41.499
<i>Do you see me blinking? I'm not blinking!</i>

25:41.665 --> 25:44.760
<i>For a very long time!</i>

25:49.798 --> 25:53.302
<i>- He's like a god. A god of pepper spray.
Uncomfortable, but in a great way.</i>

25:53.469 --> 25:54.812
<i>Certainly not human.</i>

25:54.970 --> 25:56.643
<i>He broke the record!</i>

25:56.805 --> 26:00.651
<i>Here at Bally's, you'll be pampered
like an enormous baby.</i>

26:00.809 --> 26:03.983
<i>There's a hair dryer and an ironing board
in every room.</i>

26:04.146 --> 26:06.069
<i>And if you like steakhouses...</i>

26:06.273 --> 26:10.653
<i>you'll love Bally's signature steakhouse,
Bally's Steakhouse.</i>

26:10.903 --> 26:13.827
<i>And after dinner, check out
the Incredible Burt & Anton...</i>

26:13.989 --> 26:17.038
<i>...in their own Burt & Anton Theater.</i>

26:19.495 --> 26:24.501
<i>Abra, abracabadbra
I wanna reach out and grab ya</i>

26:24.666 --> 26:26.384
<i>Abra, abracabadbra</i>

26:26.543 --> 26:29.638
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm Burt Wonderstone.

26:29.797 --> 26:31.299
And I'm Anton Marvelton.

26:31.465 --> 26:33.809
But, of course, you already knew that.

26:39.515 --> 26:42.644
In order to achieve this impossible feat
of impossibility...

26:42.810 --> 26:46.690
...we will need a female volunteer
from the audience. Who will that be?

26:46.855 --> 26:49.199
Who will the female volunteer be?

26:52.361 --> 26:53.908
All right.

26:56.532 --> 26:57.704
Nope.

26:57.866 --> 26:59.539
You're a dude.

27:01.245 --> 27:03.043
Yes, $2 million.

27:04.331 --> 27:05.708
Two point five million.

27:06.375 --> 27:08.878
Okay. I'm sorry about that, guys.

27:10.546 --> 27:11.638
How are you?

27:11.797 --> 27:13.014
I am incredible.

27:13.173 --> 27:15.267
Mm. Wow.

27:15.425 --> 27:17.348
Look how big Judah's gotten.

27:17.511 --> 27:19.605
- Yeah.
- How old is he now?

27:21.640 --> 27:23.392
I don't know.

27:23.559 --> 27:27.939
But I'll tell you what. That kid?
That kid is your biggest fan.

27:28.105 --> 27:29.277
Ah. I love it!

27:29.439 --> 27:31.908
Unfortunately, I'm starting to think
he's your only fan.

27:32.067 --> 27:33.740
Mm. Ha, ha.

27:33.902 --> 27:36.075
- What?
- Your ticket sales suck.

27:37.364 --> 27:40.288
- Well, we have a following.
- You need a younger crowd, okay?

27:40.450 --> 27:43.124
Have you heard of this Steve Gray guy?

27:43.287 --> 27:46.917
Ah. God. Let me tell you about Steve Gray.

27:47.082 --> 27:50.507
All that guys does is mumble and cut himself.
Anybody can do that.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.546
My niece does that. Heh.

27:53.630 --> 27:58.010
Well, he's getting a national following
between the ages of 25 and 45.

27:58.177 --> 28:01.272
They're calling him the future of magic.

28:01.930 --> 28:03.773
Would you like to see his latest stunt?

28:03.932 --> 28:06.105
Mm-mm. All right.

28:08.061 --> 28:11.736
<i>For 12 long days, he's held his urine.</i>

28:11.899 --> 28:12.946
No!

28:13.108 --> 28:17.113
<i>Be there for the final hour
of Steve Gray's incredible stunt.</i>

28:17.279 --> 28:20.249
<i>- Ahh!</i>
<i>- "Holding It In."</i>

28:20.407 --> 28:23.786
<i>Is that a fountain over there?
Seriously, could we turn that off?</i>

28:23.952 --> 28:25.124
<i>That's not fair.</i>

28:25.287 --> 28:27.506
<i>Live on Intense TV.</i>

28:27.664 --> 28:30.338
<i>I'm sure this is normal,
but my legs are shutting down.</i>

28:30.500 --> 28:34.596
<i>What is going through your mind right now?</i>

28:34.755 --> 28:36.132
<i>I really have to pee, Richard.</i>

28:36.298 --> 28:37.641
<i>Yeah.</i>

28:37.799 --> 28:42.851
<i>He's made it this far, but will he last?</i>

28:43.013 --> 28:45.892
<i>He should be dead.
Right now, he's got more urine than blood.</i>

28:46.058 --> 28:51.280
<i>So join us this Friday
at 9/8 Central on Intense TV.</i>

28:53.482 --> 28:57.032
A magician? You call that a magician?
You actually enjoy that?

28:57.194 --> 28:58.787
I don't enjoy any of this shit.

28:59.655 --> 29:01.077
All right, Burt...

29:01.240 --> 29:05.837
...this is the brochure
for my new signature hotel, Doug.

29:05.994 --> 29:08.122
This hotel is the same
as all the other hotels.

29:08.288 --> 29:10.711
But I'm going to be charging 70% more
for everything.

29:10.874 --> 29:12.501
Now, do you know why I can do that?

29:13.669 --> 29:16.343
- Because it's shinier?
- Shut up.

29:16.505 --> 29:18.007
Because it's new.

29:18.173 --> 29:19.550
And people love new.

29:19.716 --> 29:23.016
And when people love something,
it becomes valuable.

29:23.178 --> 29:27.354
So new equals valuable.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

29:32.562 --> 29:35.315
You've been doing the same shit
since I hired you.

29:35.482 --> 29:39.703
You even come onstage
to that same goddamn song.

29:39.861 --> 29:42.865
It's called "Abracadabra."
And it is considered a modern classic.

29:43.031 --> 29:45.500
- It's shit.
- I agree with him, Burt.

29:45.659 --> 29:49.380
There's no reason we couldn't do
something big. Headline-grabbing.

29:49.538 --> 29:51.290
I am not holding my piss!

29:51.456 --> 29:53.049
Steve Gray already did that.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.755
He owns that. He owns it.

29:54.918 --> 29:57.888
You need to do something else,
something fresh.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.266
I suppose I could hold my poop.

30:01.883 --> 30:04.727
I'll have a large meal.
I'll eat some yogurt and granola.

30:04.886 --> 30:07.230
And I'll hold my poop. For 24 hours.

30:07.389 --> 30:09.858
- What is wrong with him?
- "Will Burt poop?"

30:10.017 --> 30:11.189
"Will it happen?"

30:11.351 --> 30:12.978
"Will he crap his pants?"

30:15.814 --> 30:17.407
I think I've got something.

30:28.243 --> 30:29.586
Keep coming.

30:32.247 --> 30:34.420
Now, why do you call it The Hot Box?

30:34.583 --> 30:39.089
Well, the Vegas sun will effectively
turn the Plexiglas box into an oven.

30:39.254 --> 30:42.599
We estimate the interior temperature
may hit 200 degrees.

30:42.758 --> 30:46.058
And you and Burt Wonderstone plan
to stay in the box an entire week?

30:46.219 --> 30:49.814
That's right, reporter. Hello.

30:49.973 --> 30:51.270
Excuse us.

30:52.642 --> 30:54.269
What are you wearing?

30:54.436 --> 30:57.315
My magician's costume
because I am a magician.

30:57.481 --> 31:00.951
The whole point of this is to update our act.
You need to go change.

31:01.109 --> 31:05.285
Now this is Vegas, baby. Look at this crowd.
This is what I'm talking about.

31:05.447 --> 31:07.620
This is awesome.
I wish I could come with you.

31:07.783 --> 31:10.912
You don't want to do that, son.
It's gonna smell like ass in there.

31:11.078 --> 31:12.639
Okay, guys, we're ready for you.

31:12.704 --> 31:14.627
- You're gonna wear that?
- Yes.

31:14.790 --> 31:17.293
It's velvet, Burt. You're gonna die.

31:22.672 --> 31:24.766
Ah. That's better.

31:24.925 --> 31:26.518
<i>Everybody dance now</i>

31:26.676 --> 31:29.520
Ladies and gentlemen, the beautiful Nicole!

31:34.643 --> 31:37.112
Just remember,
all you have to do is nothing.

31:39.481 --> 31:41.825
<i>Come on, let's sweat</i>

31:41.983 --> 31:43.656
<i>Baby</i>

31:46.446 --> 31:48.369
<i>Let the rhythm move you</i>

31:48.532 --> 31:52.412
<i>- Sweat
- Sweat</i>

31:52.577 --> 31:54.625
<i>Let the music take control</i>

31:54.788 --> 31:58.463
<i>Everybody!
Come on, let's sweat</i>

31:58.625 --> 32:00.593
<i>Baby</i>

32:01.002 --> 32:05.223
<i>Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you</i>

32:23.191 --> 32:25.034
Whoo.

32:25.652 --> 32:27.575
All right.

32:38.665 --> 32:41.669
I just realized I won't be having sex for a week.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.467
- What are you doing?
- Breathing exercises.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.055
I've been doing them all week.

32:50.218 --> 32:52.596
- You're practicing breathing?
- Yes.

32:52.762 --> 32:54.480
Okay.

32:54.806 --> 32:56.228
A nice view.

32:58.226 --> 33:00.103
It's smaller than I thought it would be.

33:00.270 --> 33:02.739
Okay, maybe if you'd come
to even one rehearsal...

33:02.898 --> 33:04.525
"Maybe if you'd come to rehearsal."

33:04.691 --> 33:07.535
Maybe you need to rehearse
sitting in a box, Anton. I don't.

33:07.694 --> 33:09.617
- Fine.
- Not this guy.

33:12.073 --> 33:13.916
I can't breathe, I can't breathe!

33:14.075 --> 33:16.749
- Yes, you can! Yes, you can!
- No, it's so small!

33:16.912 --> 33:18.630
Relax. It's only been 20 minutes.

33:18.788 --> 33:20.109
- Don't touch me!
- Okay.

33:25.754 --> 33:27.097
We're just having fun!

33:35.764 --> 33:37.311
Burt! Stop it!

33:37.474 --> 33:38.726
Please, just calm down.

33:38.892 --> 33:42.271
- Burt, you're going to break the box.
- No, you're gonna break the box!

33:57.661 --> 33:59.629
Help us!

33:59.788 --> 34:02.132
Help me. Help me.

34:02.290 --> 34:04.338
- Burt!
- Help me, I'm slipping! Aah!

34:06.670 --> 34:08.172
This is the best trick ever!

34:09.089 --> 34:11.137
Hold on, Burt! Breathe, Burt!

34:11.299 --> 34:12.972
- Don't panic!
- Shut up!

34:14.469 --> 34:16.096
Lower the crane!

34:16.263 --> 34:18.063
- What are you doing? No!
- Climbing!

34:18.598 --> 34:19.770
Hey, not there!

34:20.641 --> 34:22.485
You're killing me!

34:23.270 --> 34:24.772
Hurry up! Unh!

34:28.149 --> 34:29.525
No, Burt!

34:34.947 --> 34:36.449
Oh, my ankles are broken.

34:36.616 --> 34:39.495
Aah! Your face got me right in the knee.

34:39.661 --> 34:41.333
I told you this was a bad idea.

34:41.496 --> 34:43.293
This wasn't a bad idea, Burt!

34:43.456 --> 34:46.505
It was a good idea screwed up
by a pompous ass!

34:46.668 --> 34:49.012
Oh, really? Agh!

34:49.170 --> 34:51.217
This partnership is over. I quit!

34:51.380 --> 34:53.725
What? Just because a couple
of broken ankles?

34:53.882 --> 34:56.181
- Some of his ribs are broken.
- You are so selfish!

34:56.344 --> 34:59.848
Me? I can't believe I put up with you
for so many years!

35:00.015 --> 35:02.814
You know what? I don't need you.
Nobody comes to see you.

35:02.976 --> 35:05.354
They call it "The Incredible Burt & Anton"...

35:05.520 --> 35:08.148
...not "The Incredible Burt
& the Incredible Anton"!

35:08.315 --> 35:11.945
- "The incredible" applies to both of us!
- That is a hateful thing to say!

35:12.110 --> 35:14.078
Whatever! You're welcome to it!

35:14.237 --> 35:17.832
- Good luck, you incredible asshole!
- Aah!

35:17.991 --> 35:20.835
- You're gonna be all right.
- We don't know that yet.

35:20.994 --> 35:22.120
Oh.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.338
You're the asshole.

35:24.748 --> 35:26.170
That's it?

35:26.333 --> 35:30.383
Thirty years of friendship, Burt.
Say something.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.143
Ladies and gentlemen...

35:45.310 --> 35:46.857
...The Hot Box!

35:47.854 --> 35:50.573
Yes, folks, it's truly a sad day.

35:53.860 --> 35:55.328
Judah!

35:55.862 --> 35:58.035
Judah, move your little ass.

36:00.241 --> 36:01.709
Burt, are you here?

36:01.868 --> 36:05.088
Oh, hello, Nicole. I'm taking a tub.

36:05.246 --> 36:08.250
- It's Jane. I'll wait till you're done.
- No! It's a bubble bath.

36:08.416 --> 36:10.589
You can't see anything. Come on in.

36:10.752 --> 36:13.926
Okay. I just think we need to talk
about everything because I just...

36:14.089 --> 36:16.308
Oh, my God! Burt.

36:16.466 --> 36:19.595
Oh. The bubbles seem to have dissipated.

36:21.429 --> 36:23.056
There. That's not better.

36:23.223 --> 36:26.944
Listen. I wanted to talk to you
about the show.

36:27.894 --> 36:29.817
The show goes on.

36:29.979 --> 36:33.779
Well, it's called "Burt & Anton:
A Magical Friendship."

36:33.942 --> 36:35.990
- Yes, and?
- Anton is gone.

36:37.445 --> 36:39.948
- So?
- How are we gonna do the show?

36:40.490 --> 36:42.618
- Nicole. Let me explain something.
- Jane.

36:42.784 --> 36:46.789
I don't need a partner. I never needed a partner,
certainly not Anton.

36:46.955 --> 36:50.801
He was just a weight around my legs.

36:50.959 --> 36:52.802
What did he ever bring to the equation?

36:52.961 --> 36:58.468
Business acumen
and ideas and friendship. Pfft!

36:58.633 --> 36:59.759
Better off without him.

36:59.926 --> 37:02.054
- You think you can handle it on your own?
- Mm-hm.

37:02.220 --> 37:06.145
- Give it a shot, because I can't watch this.
- I don't need him and I don't need you!

37:06.307 --> 37:07.980
Good, because you don't have us.

37:08.143 --> 37:11.147
And another thing!
Why don't you get in the tub?

37:11.312 --> 37:12.859
Oh, God.

37:28.329 --> 37:33.677
<i>Abra, abracabadbra
I wanna reach out and grab ya</i>

37:33.835 --> 37:36.884
<i>Abra, abracabadbra</i>

37:39.007 --> 37:40.554
<i>Abracabadbra</i>

37:41.134 --> 37:44.684
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Burt Wonderstone.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.357
But, of course, you already knew that.

37:48.099 --> 37:51.023
<i>Abra, abracabadbra</i>

37:52.520 --> 37:54.693
<i>I wanna reach out and grab ya</i>

37:55.523 --> 37:58.322
<i>Abra, abracabadbra</i>

38:00.862 --> 38:02.705
Now, what you may not know...

38:02.864 --> 38:08.542
...is that I have been magical friends
with each other since I was young boys.

38:08.703 --> 38:12.128
I've always known
that there was something different...

38:12.290 --> 38:14.543
...about my friendship...

38:14.709 --> 38:16.382
...with myself.

38:16.544 --> 38:18.421
Hey, remember my games of Hangman?

38:18.588 --> 38:19.885
I sure do.

38:20.048 --> 38:25.680
But I played them a little differently
than the other kids.

38:34.187 --> 38:35.734
Hold on, hold on.

38:36.231 --> 38:37.904
Cloak.

38:42.237 --> 38:44.160
"Hangman."

39:29.617 --> 39:33.463
- That was shit. That was shit.
- I think that went pretty damn well.

39:33.621 --> 39:35.464
It was a train wreck!

39:35.623 --> 39:37.296
That is it! I'm pulling the plug!

39:37.458 --> 39:38.801
What are you talking about?

39:38.960 --> 39:42.931
You said you were gonna do a new show!
That was the same show, just without Anton!

39:43.089 --> 39:45.467
You can't be magical friends with yourself!

39:45.633 --> 39:49.809
Fine! Any hotel in Vegas
would kill to have Burt Wonderstone.

39:49.971 --> 39:53.145
- Really?
- And besides, I put away a ton of money.

39:53.474 --> 39:55.351
You put away almost nothing.

39:55.518 --> 39:58.613
What are all these words?
This is gobbledygook.

39:58.771 --> 40:01.490
- What about all my investments?
- Yes, okay. Good.

40:01.649 --> 40:03.322
What about them? Here you go.

40:03.484 --> 40:07.489
There's your imported Mexican spring water,
<i>Aqua de Leche.</i>

40:07.655 --> 40:10.499
That was a very classy product.
High-end packaging.

40:10.658 --> 40:12.001
It's Mexican water, Burt.

40:12.160 --> 40:15.334
You were selling the promise
of diarrhea for three bucks a bottle.

40:15.496 --> 40:18.375
How about the millions you put
into that theme restaurant.

40:18.541 --> 40:20.885
James Cameron's <i>Titanic</i> Cafe
was a great idea.

40:21.044 --> 40:22.512
Our only mistakes were:

40:22.670 --> 40:26.265
A, made the floor too slanty,
food kept sliding off the plates...

40:26.424 --> 40:30.099
...and B,
did not get James Cameron's permission.

40:30.261 --> 40:32.389
Gotta get permission. We talked about that.

40:32.555 --> 40:35.229
It's your lavish lifestyle.
Don't you understand, Burt?

40:35.391 --> 40:39.362
You spent $75,000 last month
on bed sheets.

40:39.854 --> 40:43.028
Are you telling me
that I don't have any money?

40:45.652 --> 40:50.158
You have a savings bond. Here.

40:53.660 --> 40:56.379
Two hundred dollars
that my nana gave to me.

40:56.537 --> 41:00.838
Yeah, $200 in 1973.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.343
Today it is worth:

41:03.252 --> 41:05.630
$248.

41:07.048 --> 41:09.847
Hmm. Hmm.

41:10.927 --> 41:12.520
The pout.

41:42.500 --> 41:46.425
- Burt?
<i>- Hello, Nicole. How are you? That's great.</i>

41:46.587 --> 41:51.718
<i>I had to give up my suite,
so I was wondering if I might be able...</i>

41:51.884 --> 41:56.765
<i>- ...to crash at your place for a couple of nights.</i>
- Oh, that's probably not a good idea, because...

41:56.931 --> 42:00.606
<i>Well, here's the thing.
I have not eaten in 24 hours...</i>

42:00.768 --> 42:05.274
<i>...because it turns out that room service
does not deliver outside the hotel.</i>

42:05.440 --> 42:08.284
Yeah, that's pretty standard. I...

42:11.320 --> 42:15.791
I guess you could stay here for a night.
Do you know where I live?

42:20.788 --> 42:23.883
I am in need of rabbit food and birdseed.

42:24.917 --> 42:27.966
- Wow. You really were hungry.
- Mm.

42:28.546 --> 42:30.469
I almost ate one of my rabbits.

42:30.631 --> 42:32.975
But they're riddled with lice.

42:33.134 --> 42:37.139
Look at me. Burt Wonderstone,
the greatest magician in the world...

42:37.305 --> 42:40.650
...sitting in this cruddy little apartment,
eating slop.

42:40.808 --> 42:41.980
What is this?

42:42.143 --> 42:44.612
It's pan-roasted tilapia
with squash blossoms.

42:46.022 --> 42:48.616
Horrible gruel.
I imagine this is what prisoners eat.

42:48.775 --> 42:50.903
I'll get it. Let me get that.

42:51.319 --> 42:52.912
Thank you.

42:54.655 --> 42:56.999
Oh, that's not... Um.

42:57.200 --> 42:58.326
Okay.

43:04.499 --> 43:06.843
That's me and my grandmother.
She was a showgirl.

43:07.001 --> 43:08.674
I used to come visit her in Vegas...

43:08.836 --> 43:12.636
...and that's when I first saw your show
at the Golden Nugget. It was so good.

43:12.799 --> 43:15.848
I knew right then and there
that I wanted to do magic.

43:16.010 --> 43:17.808
- Really?
- Yes.

43:17.970 --> 43:19.313
Do you know what time it is?

43:19.806 --> 43:20.853
It...

43:22.642 --> 43:24.861
Very good. Give it back, please.

43:25.019 --> 43:26.145
I already did.

43:27.855 --> 43:31.655
- Fine. You can do a little sleight of hand.
- Oh, your wallet.

43:32.568 --> 43:33.615
Hmm.

43:33.778 --> 43:35.997
Oh, God, you really are broke. Five dollars?

43:36.155 --> 43:39.159
I... I actually need that.

43:41.494 --> 43:42.666
Don't crumple it.

43:48.417 --> 43:50.670
I have millions of ideas for tricks, Burt.

43:50.837 --> 43:53.556
Did you really think I wanted
to be a magician's assistant?

43:53.714 --> 43:55.091
- Yes.
- No, Burt!

43:55.633 --> 43:57.055
Make me your partner.

43:57.218 --> 43:58.891
- Poor, sweet Nicole.
- My name's Jane.

43:59.053 --> 44:01.556
My act is incredibly intricate.

44:01.722 --> 44:04.145
It is a product of years of study
and training...

44:04.308 --> 44:08.984
...and, no offense, but you are a girl.

44:09.730 --> 44:11.073
You gotta be kidding me.

44:11.232 --> 44:14.236
Not that girls can't do magic.
It's just that men are better at it.

44:14.402 --> 44:16.450
You know what?
I don't want you staying here.

44:16.612 --> 44:18.239
And I don't want to work with you.

44:18.406 --> 44:20.750
Just because I said that men
are better than women?

44:20.908 --> 44:24.583
I said "no offense."
Therefore, you cannot be offended.

44:24.745 --> 44:25.792
Legally.

44:26.289 --> 44:29.543
When I saw you ten years ago,
you loved what you did.

44:30.084 --> 44:32.257
I could feel it all the way in the back row...

44:32.420 --> 44:36.596
...and now you're just a sad,
pathetic shell of what you once were...

44:36.757 --> 44:38.600
...and I don't want any part of it.

44:41.929 --> 44:43.101
What are you doing?

44:44.599 --> 44:46.146
Did I misread the situation?

44:46.309 --> 44:49.108
- Yes. Badly. Just get out.
- Fine.

44:49.270 --> 44:52.114
- I have many options.
- Great.

45:27.516 --> 45:29.610
It's so small.

45:30.478 --> 45:33.732
No, I'm saying this bed is the
size a dog would use, or a small child.

45:33.898 --> 45:35.366
I need a bigger bed.

45:39.362 --> 45:42.866
This is your town, Burt.
Tomorrow you take it back.

45:43.032 --> 45:44.659
Steve Wynn, please.

45:44.825 --> 45:46.827
Burt Wonderstone.

45:48.246 --> 45:50.248
Well, do you know when he'll be out
of the meeting?

45:51.624 --> 45:52.671
Shh.

45:52.833 --> 45:54.335
I'm trying to talk to Steve Wynn.

45:54.502 --> 45:57.176
Would you tell the Hilton family
Burt Wonderstone called?

45:57.338 --> 45:59.090
Can you have Mr. Trump call me back?

45:59.257 --> 46:01.180
I don't care which Hilton. Nicky will do.

46:01.342 --> 46:05.518
Well, can you have Mrs. Trump call me back?
Mr. Luxor, please.

46:06.555 --> 46:08.057
I don't understand.

46:08.224 --> 46:10.352
<i>Don't think so. I'm not looking for a partner.</i>

46:10.518 --> 46:13.818
I've been a solo act for a million years
and it's going pretty good.

46:13.980 --> 46:16.340
- David, how long have we been friends?
- We're not friends.

46:16.399 --> 46:20.245
Mm-hm. Mm-hm, but if we teamed up,
it could bring your career to the next level.

46:20.403 --> 46:22.872
Well, I have a star
on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

46:23.364 --> 46:24.490
Imagine this:

46:24.657 --> 46:27.001
"The Incredible Burt & David."

46:27.868 --> 46:28.915
No.

46:30.621 --> 46:31.668
All right.

47:07.074 --> 47:10.248
Thank you.
I can make a lot of liquids disappear...

47:10.411 --> 47:13.881
...but nothing makes liquids disappear
better than Bounty paper towels.

47:14.040 --> 47:17.761
They're the quicker picker-upper.
Two rolls for 2.99.

47:17.918 --> 47:19.135
All right, Burt.

47:19.295 --> 47:21.423
- This should do it.
- Thank you, Terry.

47:21.589 --> 47:24.183
If I can do anything else for you,
you have my card.

47:24.342 --> 47:26.262
- Got it.
- My cell phone number's on there.

47:26.385 --> 47:29.764
Uh-huh.
- I will leave my ringer on vibrate.

47:43.611 --> 47:46.285
- You're the man!
- That's right, Steve!

47:47.114 --> 47:50.914
I'm sure you've seen people walk
on red-hot coals.

47:51.869 --> 47:53.963
But I doubt you've seen anyone...

47:54.121 --> 47:55.794
...spend the night...

47:55.998 --> 47:57.966
...on red-hot coals.

47:58.125 --> 48:00.253
No way!

48:00.628 --> 48:03.381
You know what I say
when I see a bed of...

48:04.590 --> 48:05.933
...red-hot coals?

48:06.092 --> 48:07.844
Bring it!

48:08.636 --> 48:10.604
Lucky guess.

48:35.329 --> 48:39.505
Now, what you're smelling is not barbecue,
ladies and gentlemen.

48:39.667 --> 48:41.214
It is my actual flesh.

48:41.377 --> 48:43.129
That's crazy.

48:43.295 --> 48:44.922
See you in the morning!

48:46.465 --> 48:49.594
Somebody get me a wake-up call,
or I'll sleep right through!

50:08.214 --> 50:10.888
Under the O, 62.

50:13.093 --> 50:17.439
This is our common room
where you'll be doing the majority of your shit.

50:17.598 --> 50:19.271
What kind of people end up here?

50:19.433 --> 50:21.652
Well, most of them were performers
on the Strip.

50:21.810 --> 50:24.404
- Lounge singers, strippers.
- B-1, baby.

50:24.563 --> 50:26.406
Celebrity impersonators.

50:26.565 --> 50:29.910
- So this is where old entertainers go to die.
- Mm-hm.

50:30.069 --> 50:31.946
And some not so old.

50:32.238 --> 50:34.081
I-29.

50:37.910 --> 50:40.459
Hello. How are you?

50:42.915 --> 50:44.462
What's your name?

50:44.625 --> 50:45.751
- Grace.
- Mm.

50:46.293 --> 50:48.295
Grace, I'm Burt.

50:48.629 --> 50:50.472
That's a lovely bracelet you have.

50:50.631 --> 50:52.884
May I see that for a minute?

50:56.262 --> 50:58.060
Take your time.

51:03.352 --> 51:05.571
The clasp is in the back.

51:06.438 --> 51:09.066
Yes. Oh, there we go.

51:09.608 --> 51:11.326
Oh. Thank you.

51:11.485 --> 51:14.204
Now, watch this.

51:16.949 --> 51:19.293
Aah! Where did it go?

51:19.451 --> 51:21.453
I don't know.

51:21.870 --> 51:25.170
My granddaughter gave that to me.

51:25.624 --> 51:28.343
What have you done? Oh.

51:28.502 --> 51:30.800
No. It's right here.

51:30.963 --> 51:34.217
I have it. I have it. I have it. It's right here.

51:34.383 --> 51:35.555
I'm a magician.

51:36.927 --> 51:39.146
I should have explained that to you earlier.

51:39.305 --> 51:40.852
Oh, my God.

51:43.726 --> 51:45.353
It's all right.

51:47.521 --> 51:51.776
Sir, if you would do me a kindness
and select one card only from this deck.

51:51.942 --> 51:53.489
He's forcing it on you.

51:54.528 --> 51:58.158
- Show the card to others. Do not show me.
- Don't do it. He's a hack.

51:58.324 --> 51:59.371
Shh.

51:59.867 --> 52:02.962
Please put the card back in the deck.
Do not show me the card.

52:04.204 --> 52:06.753
- I will cut the deck once...
- He already knows the card.

52:06.915 --> 52:08.713
- Is this your card?
- No.

52:08.876 --> 52:11.379
- Really? Hmm. That's odd.
- It's part of the bit.

52:11.545 --> 52:14.924
He's gonna guess wrong twice
and then tell you the card's in your pocket.

52:15.090 --> 52:16.888
Thank you, sir, for ruining the trick.

52:17.051 --> 52:19.270
Well, thank you for being so terrible.

52:28.020 --> 52:30.443
Hey, pal. Cardigan.

52:31.190 --> 52:34.569
- What's your problem?
- I don't have a problem, but you do.

52:34.735 --> 52:37.158
- Oh.
- Your Zarrow Shuffle is sloppy...

52:37.321 --> 52:39.870
...your lips move
when you do the Elmsley Count...

52:40.032 --> 52:43.377
...and your patter is boring and sad.
You wanna try and dazzle people...

52:43.535 --> 52:45.537
...not put them to sleep, for God's sakes.

52:45.704 --> 52:46.921
Really? What else?

52:47.081 --> 52:50.460
People want to think what they're seeing
is real magic, not a magic show.

52:50.626 --> 52:53.721
If you don't believe what you're doing,
how are they gonna believe?

52:53.879 --> 52:55.426
You got no joy in you, son.

52:55.589 --> 52:56.806
You got no passion.

52:56.965 --> 53:00.560
You may have seen these tricks
a thousand times before, but they haven't.

53:05.391 --> 53:06.438
Oh, my God.

53:09.103 --> 53:10.150
You're Rance Holloway.

53:13.232 --> 53:14.529
I...

53:15.234 --> 53:19.114
I had your magic kit as a kid.
You're the reason I became a magician.

53:19.279 --> 53:20.952
I'll give you your money back.

53:21.990 --> 53:24.163
Well, I don't think you understand.

53:24.493 --> 53:26.416
I am Burt Wonderstone.

53:26.620 --> 53:29.965
I gather from that I'm supposed
to pass out now?

53:30.624 --> 53:33.719
Well, I headlined at Bally's
for the last ten years.

53:34.169 --> 53:35.341
I'm very, very famous.

53:36.130 --> 53:39.600
Well, I quit the business
and I don't read the trades...

53:39.758 --> 53:41.431
...and I'm late for my coma.

53:41.593 --> 53:44.972
Well, perhaps we could just talk
for a couple of minutes?

53:45.806 --> 53:47.433
Bye.

54:09.955 --> 54:11.673
<i>This could win it!</i>

54:11.832 --> 54:13.834
<i>Tonight on The Brain Rapist:</i>

54:14.001 --> 54:15.469
<i>Will there be blood?</i>

54:17.337 --> 54:19.339
<i>And that brings us to our profile tonight.</i>

54:19.506 --> 54:23.010
<i>A man who left behind the glitz and glamour
of Las Vegas stardom...</i>

54:23.177 --> 54:25.305
<i>...to follow a different path.</i>

54:25.471 --> 54:27.473
<i>His name is Anton Marvelton.</i>

54:34.521 --> 54:38.401
<i>I started Operation Presto! because I saw
how much suffering there was in the world.</i>

54:38.567 --> 54:43.915
<i>I go to places where the children
have neither food nor clean water...</i>

54:45.157 --> 54:46.500
<i>...and I give them magic.</i>

54:47.868 --> 54:50.371
<i>And do you also give them food
and clean water?</i>

54:52.206 --> 54:55.585
<i>Well, no. I'm a magician. I bring magic.</i>

54:56.251 --> 54:59.004
<i>Hi, kids! Here you go.</i>

54:59.171 --> 55:00.844
<i>That's for you.</i>

55:01.006 --> 55:02.883
<i>Here you go, young man.</i>

55:03.050 --> 55:04.427
<i>And for you.</i>

55:04.593 --> 55:06.561
<i>Let's see that smile. Ha-ha-ha.</i>

55:06.720 --> 55:09.189
<i>Don't worry, I have plenty for everybody.</i>

55:09.348 --> 55:10.725
<i>What have we here?</i>

55:10.891 --> 55:12.438
<i>Presto! Ha-ha-ha.</i>

55:12.935 --> 55:14.403
<i>That's not all.</i>

55:14.561 --> 55:16.905
<i>Hey, here you go.</i>

55:17.064 --> 55:18.862
<i>How about that?</i>

55:22.027 --> 55:23.279
<i>There you are.</i>

55:23.445 --> 55:26.073
<i>That's for you, and you.</i>

55:26.240 --> 55:30.290
<i>They should have fresh rabbits
to practice magic with, don't you agree?</i>

55:30.786 --> 55:33.539
<i>This area of the world is so troubled.</i>

55:33.705 --> 55:37.005
<i>Not only is there rampant poverty
and no fresh water...</i>

55:37.167 --> 55:41.593
<i>...but the locals are also hooked
on a powerful drug called kratom leaf.</i>

55:41.755 --> 55:43.883
<i>It knocks them unconscious for an hour.</i>

55:44.049 --> 55:47.849
<i>So I'm trying to get them off the kratom
and hooked on magic instead.</i>

55:48.011 --> 55:50.685
<i>Now, you're here in part
because you had a falling-out...</i>

55:50.848 --> 55:54.398
<i>...with your longtime magic partner
and best friend, Burt Wonderstone.</i>

55:55.227 --> 55:56.945
<i>He was my best friend.</i>

55:57.104 --> 55:58.731
<i>He was like a brother to me.</i>

55:58.897 --> 56:01.901
<i>And I'll always be grateful to him
for showing me my first trick.</i>

56:02.401 --> 56:04.121
<i>Do you remember what that was?</i>

56:04.444 --> 56:05.946
<i>A disappearing handkerchief.</i>

56:06.113 --> 56:09.083
<i>It's the first trick everyone learns,
but I'll tell you what.</i>

56:09.241 --> 56:11.118
<i>When Burt did it that</i> day...

56:11.285 --> 56:13.663
<i>...it really blew my mind.</i>

56:24.172 --> 56:27.301
Rance, let's do some tricks.

56:28.051 --> 56:29.428
Rance.

56:29.595 --> 56:31.222
Aah! Jeez!

56:31.388 --> 56:32.480
What are you doing here?

56:32.639 --> 56:34.983
- I wanna do tricks.
- What are you doing in my room?

56:35.142 --> 56:37.486
- Look what I brought. Remember that?
- I don't care.

56:37.644 --> 56:40.318
I thought that we could do some tricks
together.

56:40.480 --> 56:43.484
The whole point of the kit was so
that you could do the tricks without me.

56:43.650 --> 56:45.994
Ooh! The dangling knot.

56:46.153 --> 56:48.326
And the rings. Remember the rings?

56:48.488 --> 56:50.832
How do these work again?

56:52.993 --> 56:57.339
If I show you how to do the rings,
will you leave me alone?

56:57.497 --> 56:59.044
We'll see.

56:59.917 --> 57:01.510
Ugh.

57:04.046 --> 57:07.266
Slide that one out, you need
to get the fingers, and there.

57:07.424 --> 57:09.677
No good. I can see the corner of the card.

57:09.843 --> 57:11.845
- Really?
- Yeah.

57:13.680 --> 57:15.682
- There?
- Yeah. Squeeze your fingers tighter.

57:15.849 --> 57:17.692
- All right.
- Tighter!

57:19.519 --> 57:23.194
How in the hell did you ever perform
on a Las Vegas stage?

57:23.357 --> 57:28.033
I didn't do very many card tricks.
I mostly worked with big giant props.

57:28.195 --> 57:29.868
Big giant props.

57:32.616 --> 57:34.368
Do you mind if I ask you something?

57:34.534 --> 57:36.377
If you feel you should.

57:37.162 --> 57:40.086
What happened? I mean,
one day you were headlining at Bally's...

57:40.248 --> 57:42.592
...the next day you just disappeared.

57:43.835 --> 57:45.883
Pass me the salt.

57:48.882 --> 57:51.726
Do you remember
why you became a magician?

57:52.219 --> 57:54.221
Because everybody loves a magician.

57:54.388 --> 57:56.015
Right.

58:01.895 --> 58:03.363
How...?

58:03.522 --> 58:04.614
How'd...?

58:05.899 --> 58:07.401
How'd...?

58:10.237 --> 58:11.955
What you're feeling right now...

58:12.114 --> 58:15.243
...that sense of awe,
that sense of wonderment...

58:15.409 --> 58:19.039
...that sense that anything
in the universe is possible?

58:19.663 --> 58:21.711
That's why you became a magician.

58:22.249 --> 58:24.877
That's why I became a magician.

58:25.252 --> 58:28.096
- That, and the women.
- That, and the women.

58:28.422 --> 58:30.766
So why did you just walk away?

58:31.675 --> 58:36.397
I was on a stage one day and,
all of a sudden, it had become rote...

58:36.596 --> 58:38.018
...it'd become mechanical...

58:38.181 --> 58:41.276
...and I didn't like that feeling.

58:41.768 --> 58:43.770
So I walked away and I never looked back.

58:45.480 --> 58:46.948
Hmm.

58:51.611 --> 58:55.616
Honestly, how did you do that
with the bird?

58:58.326 --> 59:01.170
It's partially deboned.

59:27.147 --> 59:28.615
Hello?

59:31.151 --> 59:33.028
I'll be right there.

59:33.195 --> 59:34.663
Burt! Burt, how are you?

59:34.821 --> 59:36.619
- Doug.
- Come here.

59:37.324 --> 59:39.793
- How you holding up?
- Very well, very well.

59:39.951 --> 59:41.453
Have a seat.

59:41.620 --> 59:42.872
Ah!

59:43.038 --> 59:47.168
So like I said,
I want to talk to you about performing.

59:47.334 --> 59:51.760
Yes, yes, yes. So, what do you think?
A triumphant return to Bally's?

59:51.922 --> 59:56.769
Or, perhaps, a new show
at your new hotel?

59:56.927 --> 59:59.021
Well, actually,
I had something else in mind.

59:59.179 --> 01:00:00.977
Ah. All right.

01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:03.858
See, Judah is turning, um...

01:00:04.476 --> 01:00:08.526
I don't know. He's turning something,
and we're having a little party at the house...

01:00:08.688 --> 01:00:12.943
...and when I asked him
who he would like to perform at the party...

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:15.158
...he told me he wanted you.

01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:17.201
Really?

01:00:19.074 --> 01:00:22.374
I know, I know. I couldn't believe it either.

01:00:23.161 --> 01:00:27.541
I offered him Miley Cyrus
and Justin Bieber and Mandy Patinkin.

01:00:27.707 --> 01:00:30.085
But no, no. He told me he wanted you:

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:33.217
The great and wonderful Burt Wonderstone.

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:35.219
Hmm.

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:38.393
For ten years,
I played the biggest room in Vegas.

01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:41.226
I traveled the world, I dined with kings.

01:00:41.388 --> 01:00:43.516
- And now...
- I'll pay you 500 bucks.

01:00:43.682 --> 01:00:45.525
- I will do it!
- Good.

01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:51.406
Doug Munny asked me to perform
at his kid's birthday party.

01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:53.738
Ooh. Are you gonna do it?

01:00:54.234 --> 01:00:58.284
- I will if you'll be my partner.
- I don't know. I'd have to shave.

01:00:58.446 --> 01:00:59.948
Come on, Rance, it'll be fun.

01:01:00.115 --> 01:01:04.120
I see it in your eyes. When you do a trick,
it's like you're 80 again.

01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:09.800
I want to show you something
that I think will change your mind.

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:13.052
I'm 75.

01:01:13.378 --> 01:01:15.801
Ladies and gentlemen, The Human Piñata!

01:01:15.964 --> 01:01:19.389
Now, this morning,
I ate a thousand pieces of hard candy...

01:01:19.551 --> 01:01:22.475
...and I've got to get them out
or I will surely die.

01:01:22.637 --> 01:01:24.935
- What is this, an escape?
- I wouldn't count on it.

01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:26.896
Come on, hit me as hard as you can.

01:01:27.058 --> 01:01:29.732
Hit me! Yeah! Is that all you got?

01:01:32.939 --> 01:01:35.488
Oh, Jesus. This is disgusting.

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:37.573
Can I be a magician when I grow up?

01:01:37.736 --> 01:01:39.113
Maybe if you get good grades.

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:44.414
This is what they call magic these days?
This is some kind of terrible shit!

01:01:46.494 --> 01:01:47.620
Go, go, go!

01:01:50.457 --> 01:01:52.425
Ladies and gentlemen, Steve Gray.

01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:06.477
<i>Nicole?</i>

01:02:07.098 --> 01:02:09.146
Jane.

01:02:13.146 --> 01:02:17.151
Goddamn, that's the worst thing
I ever saw in my life.

01:02:17.817 --> 01:02:20.491
And I saw my kids being born.

01:02:20.654 --> 01:02:23.282
Holy mackerel. Are you kidding me, Burt?

01:02:23.448 --> 01:02:26.497
You never told us you were friends
with the famous Rance Holloway!

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.162
It is an honor, sir.

01:02:28.328 --> 01:02:30.205
- You're too kind.
- Mr. Holloway.

01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:32.840
What in the hell happened to you?

01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:36.094
I work with cats. Large cats.

01:02:36.294 --> 01:02:40.891
I went on a date last night and one
of them got jealous and ripped my face.

01:02:41.049 --> 01:02:43.723
- Goddamn.
- Well, my girlfriend got it worse.

01:02:47.806 --> 01:02:50.355
They said this was a magicians' bar.

01:02:51.685 --> 01:02:54.529
- What are you doing in here?
- Mr. Gray.

01:02:55.021 --> 01:02:57.319
What you do is not magic.

01:02:58.525 --> 01:02:59.572
It is monkey porn.

01:03:00.068 --> 01:03:03.823
I understand. It's natural for a dying leaf
to be frightened by the autumn wind.

01:03:03.989 --> 01:03:05.787
- Mm.
- It's not about pulling a rabbit...

01:03:05.949 --> 01:03:07.542
...out of your hat anymore.

01:03:08.034 --> 01:03:10.833
It's about pulling your heart
out of your chest.

01:03:13.707 --> 01:03:16.711
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

01:03:16.876 --> 01:03:20.722
It means I take people's nightmares
and turn them into dream realities.

01:03:21.548 --> 01:03:24.176
What in the fuck is a dream reality?

01:03:24.718 --> 01:03:25.935
And you are...?

01:03:26.094 --> 01:03:30.065
Hold on a minute, Steve. You're telling us
you don't know who Rance Holloway is?

01:03:30.223 --> 01:03:32.476
- Never heard of him.
- We owe this man everything.

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:34.235
And you don't know who he is.

01:03:34.394 --> 01:03:37.068
I didn't say I don't know who he is.

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:38.948
I said I've never heard of him.

01:03:41.026 --> 01:03:43.074
Your skin makes me cry.

01:03:49.784 --> 01:03:52.082
That's a very sick hombre.

01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:57.884
Well, when do we start rehearsing
our kids' show?

01:04:01.755 --> 01:04:03.883
- Are you ready?
- Let's give it a try.

01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:08.603
- Say, would you like to go golfing?
- Sure!

01:04:18.772 --> 01:04:20.069
Here you go.

01:04:35.163 --> 01:04:36.631
Let's go golfing. What?

01:05:00.438 --> 01:05:02.691
- Rance Holloway!
- Thank you.

01:05:10.657 --> 01:05:12.330
This is my handkerchief.

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:18.502
Told you you'd do great.

01:05:18.665 --> 01:05:20.008
Bun?

01:05:22.001 --> 01:05:24.345
Hey. What are you doing here?

01:05:24.504 --> 01:05:26.506
I came to visit my grandmother.

01:05:27.006 --> 01:05:28.508
Hi.

01:05:28.716 --> 01:05:31.014
- Hello, darling.
- Grace is your grandmother?

01:05:31.177 --> 01:05:33.179
Yeah. What are you doing here?

01:05:33.847 --> 01:05:35.064
I entertain the residents.

01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:39.022
I haven't seen her this happy in ages.

01:05:39.185 --> 01:05:40.653
We're having an affair.

01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:47.076
I don't get it. I don't understand
how you can work for Steve Gray.

01:05:47.235 --> 01:05:48.862
You are so much better than that.

01:05:49.028 --> 01:05:51.531
You didn't think that
when I asked to be your partner.

01:05:51.698 --> 01:05:53.166
Well, that was a different time.

01:05:53.324 --> 01:05:55.747
Women didn't have the same freedoms
that they do now.

01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:58.038
It was a month ago.

01:05:58.204 --> 01:06:00.206
Listen, I know he sucks. I need a job.

01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:02.592
And I don't have to defend myself to you.

01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:05.094
- No, I know you don't, Jane.
- Thank you.

01:06:07.213 --> 01:06:09.591
Did you just actually call me
by my real name?

01:06:11.759 --> 01:06:15.263
I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I've been
such a jerk to you.

01:06:18.266 --> 01:06:21.566
And that I was so unprofessional.

01:06:21.728 --> 01:06:25.733
And that I always called you Nicole,
even though I knew your name was Jane.

01:06:27.442 --> 01:06:30.241
There's like a hundred more things
on my internal checklist.

01:06:30.403 --> 01:06:35.079
Okay. That I objectified you,
and that I always stood too close to you...

01:06:35.241 --> 01:06:39.587
...and that I yelled at you, and that I tried
to make you feel uncomfortable, and that I...

01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:41.589
Okay, you can stop. Don't hurt yourself.

01:06:42.582 --> 01:06:48.305
So whatever I did that was insensitive
and stupid, I'm sorry.

01:06:50.381 --> 01:06:54.431
Well, on behalf of all the Nicoles
over the last ten years...

01:06:54.594 --> 01:06:56.596
...I accept your apology.

01:06:56.763 --> 01:06:58.765
Thank you, Nicoles.

01:07:00.934 --> 01:07:04.438
We were, I don't know, 10, 11...

01:07:04.604 --> 01:07:07.699
...and there was this one kid in class
who was always mean to us...

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:08.949
...always picking on us.

01:07:09.108 --> 01:07:13.409
So we tricked him into pulling flash paper
out of the top of a wand.

01:07:13.571 --> 01:07:16.620
It exploded in his face.
The whole class laughed.

01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:19.377
- Oh, that must've been a good day.
- It was the best.

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:21.834
The next day, not so much.

01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:24.294
Kid came back, beat Anton almost to death.

01:07:24.457 --> 01:07:26.960
- Oh, no.
- He was all right.

01:07:27.335 --> 01:07:29.838
- Least you had Anton.
- Yes.

01:07:30.004 --> 01:07:34.350
I had imaginary friends,
and even they were mean, so, heh...

01:07:34.842 --> 01:07:38.517
- The life of a child magician.
- Yes, try being a girl child magician.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:40.148
They called me Magic Bitch.

01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:41.603
- They did?
- Yes.

01:07:41.766 --> 01:07:43.313
- They called me Magic Bitch.
- No.

01:07:43.476 --> 01:07:45.194
Well, no.

01:07:45.812 --> 01:07:47.655
Do you have any gigs coming up?

01:07:47.814 --> 01:07:51.114
As a matter of fact,
I have a very important international gala...

01:07:51.276 --> 01:07:53.995
...known as Doug Munny's kid's
birthday party.

01:07:54.153 --> 01:07:56.155
- Oh, that's...
- Pathetic. I know.

01:07:56.322 --> 01:07:59.997
No. I was gonna say cool.
Kids love magic, right?

01:08:03.871 --> 01:08:05.373
Right.

01:08:06.499 --> 01:08:09.173
I know you're probably busy...

01:08:09.627 --> 01:08:13.348
...but I was thinking
maybe you could be there.

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:15.391
Ooh. I am busy.

01:08:16.509 --> 01:08:17.680
But I'll be there.

01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:26.687
Judah is so lucky.

01:08:35.194 --> 01:08:39.040
Rance, it's Burt. The party is today.

01:08:39.198 --> 01:08:43.122
Just a gentle reminder. Uh, call me.

01:08:45.537 --> 01:08:48.667
- Ah, you made it.
- Yep. Well, I love cake, so...

01:08:48.832 --> 01:08:49.880
You ready?

01:08:50.042 --> 01:08:53.343
I think I'm ready, but Rance isn't here yet.
So I'm a little...

01:08:53.504 --> 01:08:55.221
- Rance is not here.
- Don't worry.

01:08:55.381 --> 01:08:56.553
You'll be fine.

01:08:56.716 --> 01:08:59.060
- I'm not nervous. Thank you.
- Right.

01:08:59.218 --> 01:09:01.312
- Good luck.
- I don't need luck, I need Rance.

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:03.064
- He'll be here.
- All right.

01:09:04.015 --> 01:09:05.062
Okay.

01:09:06.059 --> 01:09:07.902
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:11.861
...I want to thank you all
for helping me celebrate my son's...

01:09:12.023 --> 01:09:13.649
- How old are you?
- Ten.

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:15.693
My son's 10th birthday.

01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:20.915
Judah, my love...

01:09:21.073 --> 01:09:22.246
...my life...

01:09:22.408 --> 01:09:23.455
...my dreams.

01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:25.791
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks, Dad.

01:09:27.037 --> 01:09:31.589
Now, of course, Judah's birthday isn't the real
reason I invited you all out here today.

01:09:31.751 --> 01:09:35.426
As many of you know, my new hotel,
Doug, will be opening soon.

01:09:35.587 --> 01:09:40.594
And in a few weeks, I myself will be hosting
a showcase of Vegas' hottest acts.

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:42.888
Whichever entertainer
dazzles me the most...

01:09:43.054 --> 01:09:46.934
...will be getting a five-year contract
as Doug's headliner.

01:09:47.558 --> 01:09:48.604
How about that, huh?

01:09:49.602 --> 01:09:51.274
And I am very pleased to announce...

01:09:51.437 --> 01:09:55.783
...that we have our first official entrant
into that competition...

01:09:55.942 --> 01:09:59.913
...right here with us today.
He's a world-famous magician.

01:10:00.071 --> 01:10:01.323
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:10:01.489 --> 01:10:03.082
...Steve Gray!

01:10:09.497 --> 01:10:12.421
Great to see you, Steve. Thanks for coming.

01:10:13.459 --> 01:10:16.759
And I'll see you next month
at the showcase. Ha, ha.

01:10:16.921 --> 01:10:20.846
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
Now, to entertain the children...

01:10:21.008 --> 01:10:23.477
...Burt Wonderstone. Thank you.

01:10:23.636 --> 01:10:25.309
Whoo!

01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:39.699
I have a question for you. Don't you wish
you had a quarter for every time...

01:10:39.861 --> 01:10:41.955
...your parents told you to clean
your ears?

01:10:42.113 --> 01:10:44.161
- Yeah.
- Well, there's one.

01:10:44.323 --> 01:10:45.540
- That's crazy!
- Ooh.

01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:48.294
And, yes. Oh, there's another one!

01:10:48.453 --> 01:10:52.333
And the birthday boy. When was the last time
you cleaned behind your ears?

01:10:52.498 --> 01:10:54.250
- Never.
- I didn't think so.

01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:57.921
Because Judah has the grodiest ear of all!

01:10:58.087 --> 01:11:01.136
- Whoa.
- You are rich, my friend!

01:11:01.299 --> 01:11:03.347
- That's so cool.
- Amazing.

01:11:04.343 --> 01:11:07.313
- Here you go.
- Wait!

01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:09.849
- You kids wanna see some real magic?
- Yeah.

01:11:10.016 --> 01:11:11.359
- Yeah!
- All right!

01:11:11.517 --> 01:11:14.020
I'm pulling my thumb off. That's not it.

01:11:14.604 --> 01:11:17.858
Steve, what are you doing?
You're not supposed to be performing today.

01:11:18.024 --> 01:11:20.152
Just giving the people what they want.

01:11:21.861 --> 01:11:24.205
Hey, guys. Check this out.

01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:28.201
You know, if you're like me,
you're probably thinking:

01:11:28.367 --> 01:11:30.165
"That coin trick.

01:11:30.328 --> 01:11:34.333
That was a tasty little hors d'oeuvre.

01:11:34.499 --> 01:11:37.252
But my inner child is hungry...

01:11:37.418 --> 01:11:40.922
...and crying out
for something more nourishing.

01:11:41.172 --> 01:11:44.642
What have you got on the grill?"

01:11:46.385 --> 01:11:47.762
Oh, my gosh.

01:11:47.929 --> 01:11:50.773
- What is he doing?
- What is he doing?

01:11:50.932 --> 01:11:52.275
You see that?

01:11:52.934 --> 01:11:55.608
You see what I'm doing there? Hmm?

01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:57.272
Look at it. Look at it!

01:11:58.147 --> 01:11:59.569
Now look at this!

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.362
In cursive.

01:12:05.404 --> 01:12:07.247
- Yeah!
- Mm.

01:12:09.033 --> 01:12:12.754
That is a terrible trick to do for children.
What if they try and copy you?

01:12:12.912 --> 01:12:14.585
I'll sue them.

01:12:14.747 --> 01:12:16.420
- It's my trick.
- Hey, guys.

01:12:16.582 --> 01:12:18.380
Have you ever been to a party...

01:12:18.543 --> 01:12:20.511
...and someone has on
the exact same outfit?

01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:22.138
- Definitely!
- Sure!

01:12:22.296 --> 01:12:25.049
Well, here is a solution for that.

01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:27.223
Whoa.

01:12:27.385 --> 01:12:28.432
I thank you.

01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:29.891
Amazing!

01:12:30.054 --> 01:12:31.101
Wonderstone!

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:36.235
Boring!

01:12:36.394 --> 01:12:38.613
Here's how I hammer a nail.

01:12:46.445 --> 01:12:48.948
You need any work done
around the house, let me know.

01:12:49.115 --> 01:12:52.415
- Built my summer cottage that way.
- All right. Very good.

01:12:52.577 --> 01:12:55.456
Very good, indeed. But this is a classic.

01:12:55.621 --> 01:12:56.793
Meaning it's been done.

01:12:56.956 --> 01:13:00.836
Judah, what is your favorite animal?
A mole, a sloth, a puppy?

01:13:01.002 --> 01:13:02.299
- A puppy.
- A puppy. A puppy.

01:13:02.461 --> 01:13:05.135
Let's make a puppy for Judah's birthday,
shall we?

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:15.475
There you go, a puppy. Hmm.

01:13:15.641 --> 01:13:17.359
It's not really that cute, is it?

01:13:17.518 --> 01:13:20.613
Sort of a lame puppy. I think I can do better.
I'll start again.

01:13:20.771 --> 01:13:21.818
Alakazam!

01:13:21.981 --> 01:13:23.483
Oh.

01:13:24.984 --> 01:13:27.533
There you are, my friend.
Happy birthday, Judah.

01:13:27.695 --> 01:13:30.448
Wow, thanks.
I'm going to call him Wonderstone.

01:13:31.198 --> 01:13:33.041
Can I see Wonderstone for a second?

01:13:33.993 --> 01:13:37.167
Hey, everybody. Watch this, everyone.

01:13:37.496 --> 01:13:40.841
What an adorable little life form.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.345
You know,
I bet I can make him even smaller.

01:13:45.171 --> 01:13:47.219
And a little less adorable.

01:13:47.381 --> 01:13:49.679
- I like to squeeze him really hard!
- Stop it.

01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:51.515
Give me the dog. Give me that dog!

01:13:51.677 --> 01:13:52.849
Give him to me.

01:13:54.305 --> 01:13:57.309
Ash! Wow!

01:13:57.475 --> 01:14:00.194
Wonderstone has disappeared.

01:14:00.353 --> 01:14:01.900
I wonder where he went.

01:14:02.063 --> 01:14:04.532
Probably where all Wonderstones
go eventually.

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:05.987
Into obscurity.

01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:08.528
Daddy! Daddy! He crushed my dog!

01:14:09.695 --> 01:14:13.871
Are you sure about that, Judah?
Are you sure about anything?

01:14:14.033 --> 01:14:16.752
Because I think I hear something moving...

01:14:16.911 --> 01:14:19.835
...in this box right over here.

01:14:20.915 --> 01:14:22.258
Go ahead and open that.

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:25.386
Wonderstone! You're okay.

01:14:25.544 --> 01:14:28.093
- Boom.
- Ha, ha.

01:14:28.547 --> 01:14:31.801
That's a different dog, you sick bastard.
Where's the other one?

01:14:31.968 --> 01:14:33.289
Don't you worry about it.

01:14:34.178 --> 01:14:36.556
He's in a very safe place.

01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:44.738
TOP that, puppy pants.

01:14:45.690 --> 01:14:46.737
Goddamn you.

01:14:49.902 --> 01:14:51.199
Happy birthday, Judah.

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:04.422
Chin up, Burt. Bad things don't happen to us,
they happen for us.

01:15:06.085 --> 01:15:09.965
- Why couldn't you let him do just one show?
- Because I want that gig at Doug.

01:15:10.131 --> 01:15:11.553
Not really, I don't care.

01:15:11.716 --> 01:15:12.763
I want it.

01:15:12.925 --> 01:15:15.644
- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing's wrong with me.

01:15:15.803 --> 01:15:17.931
Everything's in perfect alignment.

01:15:18.097 --> 01:15:21.397
I've worked long and hard to get
where I am and no one's gonna stop me.

01:15:21.559 --> 01:15:23.277
Not Wonderstone, not you.

01:15:23.436 --> 01:15:25.109
Not even me.

01:15:25.271 --> 01:15:27.615
The future belongs to Steve Gray.

01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:30.026
And in case you haven't noticed...

01:15:30.443 --> 01:15:31.945
...I'm Steve Gray.

01:15:32.111 --> 01:15:35.706
Well, Steve Gray,
you are a terrible human being.

01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:39.620
And what's worse,
you're a really bad magician.

01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:41.002
So I quit.

01:15:41.162 --> 01:15:42.789
Nice exit line, but I'm still here.

01:15:42.955 --> 01:15:44.332
What are you gonna do now?

01:15:44.498 --> 01:15:46.500
Walk off in a huff.

01:15:46.667 --> 01:15:48.260
Excellent.

01:15:49.128 --> 01:15:52.632
Ugh, women. They're a mystery, Judah.

01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.313
Bun?

01:16:01.182 --> 01:16:02.809
Oh.

01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:08.064
- He put a dog in my pants, Jane.
- I see.

01:16:08.522 --> 01:16:11.196
- He put a live dog in my pants.
- I'm sorry.

01:16:11.358 --> 01:16:14.862
- No one's ever done that to me before.
- I hope not.

01:16:15.362 --> 01:16:17.205
He was teething.

01:16:17.364 --> 01:16:19.162
So gross.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:22.662
Hello?

01:16:25.164 --> 01:16:26.666
What?

01:16:33.672 --> 01:16:35.219
Rance.

01:16:35.841 --> 01:16:37.343
- I missed the show.
- Oh.

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:40.270
Don't worry about that.

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:42.147
This is Jane.

01:16:42.306 --> 01:16:44.559
Hi, Jane. Rance Holloway.

01:16:44.725 --> 01:16:46.944
Of course. I know who you are.

01:16:47.103 --> 01:16:49.982
- What happened?
- I had a stroke.

01:16:50.147 --> 01:16:54.072
I don't recommend it, either. It's not as much
fun as they tell you in the brochures.

01:16:55.361 --> 01:16:57.705
How'd it go? Did you do the tricks?

01:16:57.863 --> 01:16:59.536
Oh, it was fine.

01:16:59.698 --> 01:17:02.076
Did they laugh? Were they amazed?

01:17:02.243 --> 01:17:04.337
They loved it. It was great.

01:17:04.495 --> 01:17:05.838
Great.

01:17:05.996 --> 01:17:10.547
If I'd known how much fun it would be to work
with a partner, I would have done it years ago.

01:17:32.231 --> 01:17:34.233
Oh, my God.

01:17:37.570 --> 01:17:41.245
It's time for my final disappearing act.

01:17:42.408 --> 01:17:43.455
Goodbye, Burt.

01:17:50.875 --> 01:17:52.877
Where did he go?

01:17:53.043 --> 01:17:55.091
He has gone to a better place.

01:17:58.757 --> 01:18:00.430
Goodbye, Rance.

01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:03.763
- He's under the bed.
- I know.

01:18:06.432 --> 01:18:08.730
Hey, Weinselstein.

01:18:16.108 --> 01:18:17.485
You came back.

01:18:19.612 --> 01:18:21.614
But what about your work with the poor?

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:25.284
Yeah. They didn't actually want magic.

01:18:25.451 --> 01:18:26.998
They wanted food and clean water.

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:29.246
The fools.

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:34.088
Please.

01:18:42.426 --> 01:18:43.518
So...?

01:18:45.804 --> 01:18:47.272
So...

01:18:52.102 --> 01:18:54.355
It's so good to see your face.

01:18:59.109 --> 01:19:00.486
Would you like an onion ring?

01:19:00.653 --> 01:19:03.281
I missed you so much.
- Oh, Burt.

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:07.998
- I just missed you so much.
- I missed you too.

01:19:08.494 --> 01:19:11.054
After what I did to you at The Hot Box...

01:19:11.205 --> 01:19:13.333
...I didn't think you'd be my friend anymore.

01:19:13.958 --> 01:19:15.050
I can't understand you.

01:19:15.209 --> 01:19:17.553
I didn't think you wanted
to be my friend anymore.

01:19:17.711 --> 01:19:20.009
No, Burt, I'll always be your friend.

01:19:20.172 --> 01:19:21.970
And I'll always be your friend.

01:19:24.677 --> 01:19:26.725
I can't tell you what that means to me.

01:19:27.346 --> 01:19:30.145
Yes, you can.
- It means a lot.

01:19:30.349 --> 01:19:33.478
Your friendship means more to me
than anything in the world.

01:19:33.644 --> 01:19:34.691
Burt, stop.

01:19:36.897 --> 01:19:38.991
So happy.

01:19:40.859 --> 01:19:44.204
I'm so happy.

01:19:44.363 --> 01:19:46.741
Oh, I promised myself
I wasn't gonna do this.

01:19:46.907 --> 01:19:49.581
I promised myself I was going to do this.

01:19:57.376 --> 01:20:00.846
Ah, there it is. The enchanted notebook.

01:20:01.005 --> 01:20:04.509
I've always kept it with me.
There are some really great ideas in here.

01:20:04.675 --> 01:20:08.225
- What about "Raisin Storm"?
- We did it. <i>Arsenio</i> in '91.

01:20:08.679 --> 01:20:11.899
- What about "Stinky, Stinky 2x4"?
- That one's really hard on my back.

01:20:12.057 --> 01:20:14.230
Oh, yes. Listen, guys.

01:20:14.393 --> 01:20:16.896
We just need one big trick
for Munny's showcase.

01:20:17.062 --> 01:20:20.862
Some sort of grand illusion
that will really blow people's minds.

01:20:21.025 --> 01:20:24.199
Hey, wait a minute.
What's "The Disappearing Audience"?

01:20:24.361 --> 01:20:27.205
- Ugh, that was the trick we could never crack.
- Yes.

01:20:27.364 --> 01:20:30.914
How do you make an entire audience
disappear without them being in on it?

01:20:31.076 --> 01:20:34.080
- You'd have to knock them out or something.
- Well...

01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:38.417
- That herb thing.
- Kratom.

01:20:38.584 --> 01:20:40.052
What?

01:20:40.210 --> 01:20:43.089
It's a leaf they chew in Cambodia.
It knocks them right out.

01:20:43.255 --> 01:20:47.260
We would have to drug a thousand people
without their consent?

01:20:47.426 --> 01:20:50.020
Hmm. Mm.

01:20:50.179 --> 01:20:51.305
Guys, no.

01:20:51.472 --> 01:20:53.520
What? You can't be serious.

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:56.777
That would be dangerous and also illegal.

01:20:56.935 --> 01:20:59.358
- She has a point.
- Yes.

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:02.525
Yes.

01:21:02.941 --> 01:21:04.943
We should test it first.

01:21:36.475 --> 01:21:38.022
Do you think this batch is ready?

01:21:38.185 --> 01:21:40.358
I don't know. Check it.

01:22:02.418 --> 01:22:04.045
Do you think this batch is ready?

01:22:04.211 --> 01:22:06.339
I don't know. Check it.

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:16.519
Okay. Does everybody know
what they're doing?

01:22:16.682 --> 01:22:20.186
- I'm ready.
- Me too. But I am a little nervous.

01:22:20.352 --> 01:22:22.571
Anton, what could possibly go wrong?

01:22:22.729 --> 01:22:24.902
Somebody could die. We can go to prison.

01:22:25.065 --> 01:22:28.035
See? When you say it out loud,
it doesn't sound so bad.

01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:31.079
Jane, Anton and I have been talking.

01:22:31.238 --> 01:22:34.037
And if we get this gig,
we'd like you to join us.

01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:37.419
- I'd love to.
- Not as our assistant.

01:22:37.578 --> 01:22:39.046
As our opening act.

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:43.501
We think that you're a hell of a magician,
and we would like you to be our partner.

01:22:49.465 --> 01:22:51.092
Oh!

01:23:06.482 --> 01:23:07.779
All right. Heh.

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:11.737
Okay, I'm just gonna head out.

01:23:12.863 --> 01:23:14.740
Happy for you guys.

01:23:17.367 --> 01:23:20.871
Sorry, sorry. Forgot my sweater.

01:23:21.371 --> 01:23:23.999
Okay. Bye.

01:23:25.083 --> 01:23:26.630
Happy for you.

01:23:29.588 --> 01:23:31.010
All right.

01:23:41.225 --> 01:23:42.665
- Oh.
- I believe that this is yours?

01:23:44.478 --> 01:23:47.448
Very good. Mm.

01:23:47.981 --> 01:23:51.451
Oh. You have, um, something in your ear.

01:23:52.945 --> 01:23:54.117
- Very nice.
- Thank you.

01:23:54.279 --> 01:23:56.623
Unfortunately,
I don't think that will work for me.

01:23:56.782 --> 01:23:57.829
Aah.

01:23:57.991 --> 01:24:00.289
- Really?
- No, it's just for the trick.

01:24:00.452 --> 01:24:02.329
Oh, okay.

01:24:24.726 --> 01:24:27.445
He's touching me where it doesn't feel good.

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:30.608
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.

01:24:30.774 --> 01:24:32.151
Hup.

01:24:36.405 --> 01:24:40.035
Okay! Okay! Yeah, that was something!

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:41.497
Okay, get off.

01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:44.163
Go ahead. Yeah. Ahem.

01:24:44.496 --> 01:24:46.169
Sorry about that. Heh.

01:24:47.583 --> 01:24:50.507
Next up, a man who lives
on the cutting edge...

01:24:50.669 --> 01:24:52.137
...and the burning edge...

01:24:52.296 --> 01:24:54.219
...and the gouging edge of magic.

01:24:54.381 --> 01:24:58.181
You may know him from his TV show,
<i>Brain Rapist.</i>

01:24:58.343 --> 01:25:00.516
So prepare to have your brains raped.

01:25:00.679 --> 01:25:03.523
Ladies and gentlemen, Steve Gray!

01:25:23.702 --> 01:25:25.124
Thank you.

01:25:26.288 --> 01:25:27.710
But I'm not here for applause.

01:25:27.873 --> 01:25:30.672
I'm different than the other magicians
you'll see tonight.

01:25:30.834 --> 01:25:33.553
In fact, I'm not planning
on doing any magic...

01:25:33.837 --> 01:25:34.884
...at all.

01:25:35.047 --> 01:25:37.391
Instead,
I want to do a little thing I call:

01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:41.887
Drilling a hole in my head.

01:25:43.722 --> 01:25:46.566
Now, according to my research,
there's a narrow angle...

01:25:48.435 --> 01:25:50.403
...where one can drill...

01:25:54.858 --> 01:25:56.235
...into the skull...

01:25:57.736 --> 01:25:59.909
...missing all the vital parts of the brain.

01:26:00.072 --> 01:26:03.372
Now, I've been informed
by my medical team...

01:26:04.326 --> 01:26:06.670
...that I may lose one of my senses...

01:26:06.828 --> 01:26:08.751
...leaving me with only five.

01:26:09.373 --> 01:26:11.250
And no longer special in any way.

01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:14.378
Yes, just like one of you.

01:26:15.587 --> 01:26:16.804
So...

01:26:17.339 --> 01:26:19.262
...cross your fingers for me.

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:24.017
Oh, and, parents,
if you have small children with you...

01:26:24.179 --> 01:26:27.103
...you might want to lift them up
so they can see better.

01:26:27.766 --> 01:26:30.394
All right, without further delay...

01:26:31.853 --> 01:26:36.108
...let's change everything.

01:26:51.998 --> 01:26:53.625
Oh!

01:26:57.754 --> 01:26:59.347
Ta-da.

01:27:08.056 --> 01:27:10.935
- That was great!
- Thank you.

01:27:11.476 --> 01:27:13.103
Do it again!

01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:16.023
Hey, when did you guys get here?

01:27:16.523 --> 01:27:21.495
Oh, I left my drill. I left my drill out there!
I left my drill!

01:27:21.653 --> 01:27:22.779
Oh, boobies.

01:27:22.946 --> 01:27:26.166
That's why he's a star,
ladies and gentlemen! Steve Gray!

01:27:26.324 --> 01:27:28.998
Let's hear it! Ha, ha.

01:27:30.078 --> 01:27:31.580
Thank you.

01:27:31.997 --> 01:27:34.967
I feel bad for anyone
who has to follow that act.

01:27:36.418 --> 01:27:38.546
And now, to follow that act...

01:27:38.712 --> 01:27:42.558
...Burt Wonderstone and Anton
Marvelton, ladies and gentlemen!

01:27:43.842 --> 01:27:45.890
Yes! Ha, ha!

01:27:51.016 --> 01:27:53.394
Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:27:53.935 --> 01:27:58.361
Good evening. For 15 years,
Anton and I did a little show called:

01:27:58.523 --> 01:28:01.527
"Burt & Anton: A Magical Friendship."

01:28:01.985 --> 01:28:05.535
But as some of you may know,
we recently had a falling-out.

01:28:05.697 --> 01:28:08.075
Yeah, we fell right out of The Hot Box.

01:28:09.743 --> 01:28:11.871
Oh. See, ladies and gentlemen,
along the way...

01:28:12.037 --> 01:28:17.089
...we forgot the most important thing of all,
and that is that Burt needs Anton.

01:28:17.250 --> 01:28:19.548
And Anton needs Burt.

01:28:19.711 --> 01:28:22.840
Because that is what a magical friendship
is all about.

01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:28.229
Tonight, we offer you the one illusion
that we dreamed about as kids...

01:28:28.386 --> 01:28:31.014
...but never dared perform until now.

01:28:31.181 --> 01:28:35.357
I guess you could say that this trick
started 30 years ago on my birthday...

01:28:35.519 --> 01:28:38.944
...when I was given
a Rance Holloway Magic Kit.

01:28:40.065 --> 01:28:44.912
And I watched the instructional video
for the very first time.

01:28:52.911 --> 01:28:56.415
Hello, my young friends.
I'm Rance Holloway.

01:28:56.915 --> 01:28:59.259
You've probably seen me
on The Merv Griffin Show...

01:28:59.417 --> 01:29:00.919
...or live onstage...

01:29:01.086 --> 01:29:05.592
...at the fabulous Stardust Resort and Casino
in Las Vegas.

01:29:05.757 --> 01:29:08.931
Magic is the art of making people
believe something...

01:29:09.094 --> 01:29:12.519
...they know can't possibly be true.

01:29:12.681 --> 01:29:17.278
For example, if I were to say to the man
in the second row aisle seat:

01:29:17.435 --> 01:29:21.941
"That's the ugliest goddamn orange
sweater I have ever seen"...

01:29:22.107 --> 01:29:25.452
...you might be astonished,
because there's no way I could've known...

01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:29.410
...what he'd be wearing
when I recorded this 30 years ago, right?

01:29:29.573 --> 01:29:31.416
Well, let me tell you something, folks:

01:29:31.575 --> 01:29:34.545
You ain't seen nothing yet!

01:29:42.711 --> 01:29:45.305
No, you ain't seen nothing yet.

01:29:45.463 --> 01:29:49.434
Because now Burt and Anton
are going to make all of you...

01:29:49.593 --> 01:29:53.018
...everyone in this audience,
man, woman and child...

01:29:53.179 --> 01:29:58.481
...disappear from this very theater.

01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:23.627
Where are we?

01:30:32.844 --> 01:30:34.141
Oh, my God.

01:30:34.763 --> 01:30:36.982
Thank you! Thank you!

01:30:37.849 --> 01:30:39.726
- Thank you very much!
- Thank you.

01:30:39.893 --> 01:30:41.361
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

01:30:46.107 --> 01:30:47.199
We did it, Anthony.

01:30:47.359 --> 01:30:49.032
We sure did, Albert.

01:31:00.664 --> 01:31:04.919
Burt, Anton! Congratulations!
You got the gig. I don't know how you did it.

01:31:05.085 --> 01:31:07.429
- This was one hell of a trick.
- Thank you, Doug.

01:31:07.587 --> 01:31:10.386
And I was sure this was gonna be a disaster.

01:31:10.548 --> 01:31:14.269
Just one thing. You're gonna make the
audience reappear again at the Doug, right?

01:31:14.427 --> 01:31:15.929
Not a problem.

01:31:16.096 --> 01:31:19.100
Because I make a shitload of money
off them in the casino.

01:31:20.517 --> 01:31:23.737
All right. Very proud of you.

01:31:44.791 --> 01:31:45.917
Yeah.

01:31:49.045 --> 01:31:53.391
Not bad. But wait till they see
what I have planned.

01:31:54.217 --> 01:31:59.223
I'm gonna drill a hole in my head.
Right here.

01:32:05.437 --> 01:32:07.485
Ahead of my time.
