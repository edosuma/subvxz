00:16.300 --> 00:19.767
Hello.
Oh, new art.

00:19.767 --> 00:23.767
Oh... Karim.
Hello, Mr. Montana.

00:23.767 --> 00:25.800
- You remember French.
- Hi.

00:25.800 --> 00:27.767
Doesn't this remind you of the
Hamptons, this house?

00:27.767 --> 00:29.300
- Yeah.
- But we're not in the

00:29.300 --> 00:31.500
Hamptons and none of us are
together anymore!

00:31.500 --> 00:32.833
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God!

00:32.833 --> 00:35.067
Oh, man, what'd you
do, Karim?

00:35.067 --> 00:37.500
I brought you together once, I'm
gonna bring you back.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.133
When did you ever
bring... Oh, no.

00:39.133 --> 00:40.933
- I introduced you guys.
- No.

00:40.933 --> 00:42.333
Nah, he walked right
up to me.

00:42.333 --> 00:44.033
He was like, "You trying to
my sister, huh?"

00:44.033 --> 00:46.133
And I said, "Just come

00:46.133 --> 00:48.233
through me."

00:48.233 --> 00:49.833
- Do you like my nails?
- I love 'em.

00:49.833 --> 00:52.467
I like the little gold splash
you got on there.

00:52.467 --> 00:54.367
Hey, look at the way
he just touched your hand.

00:54.367 --> 00:55.533
Of course.
All the time.

00:55.533 --> 00:56.967
He didn't care about
those nails.

00:56.967 --> 00:59.000
- That's a real man.
- Oh, God.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.367
Why is she hating on
you?

01:00.367 --> 01:01.833
She's always been a
hater.

01:01.833 --> 01:04.167
Well, this has been a
lovely surprise, seeing you

01:04.167 --> 01:05.633
- here.
- Thanks for dropping

01:05.633 --> 01:06.967
- by.
- Yeah.

01:06.967 --> 01:11.833
You're gonna have a fun night.

01:11.833 --> 01:14.067
- Karim...
- Aw.

01:14.067 --> 01:15.733
It's been real.

01:15.733 --> 01:17.067
- Okay. Don't touch me.
- There you go.

01:17.067 --> 01:18.300
- Too low.
- That's the way to

01:18.300 --> 01:19.567
- start the day.
- That thing's still

01:19.567 --> 01:20.900
- fat.
- Okay.

01:20.900 --> 01:22.667
Thank you very much.

01:22.667 --> 01:24.633
- It's been real.
- Yo, talk to Kourt.

01:24.633 --> 01:26.267
- Let's make this all work out.
- All right.

01:26.267 --> 01:29.167
Double dates.
Perfect.

01:29.167 --> 01:33.367
I think we're back.

01:51.500 --> 01:54.533
What does Malika want?
Yes?

01:54.533 --> 01:56.533
Kourt, I went and
bought these shoes, 'cause I was

01:56.533 --> 01:59.233
like, oh, my dress is just so
bland, so let me get a

01:59.233 --> 02:02.367
birthday shoe.
But did you even think, Malika,

02:02.367 --> 02:05.400
about the fact that the back of
your dress has a  gold

02:05.400 --> 02:07.733
zipper going down the back of
it?

02:07.733 --> 02:10.667
Mm.
And the shoes are silver.

02:10.667 --> 02:13.767
Hellur!
Kimmy, this is a disaster.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.733
- Look at this.
- Don't trip, chocolate

02:15.733 --> 02:17.867
- chip.
- What do I do?

02:17.867 --> 02:19.200
I don't have a
solution.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.700
So I don't know what you want me
to do.

02:20.700 --> 02:22.133
I mean, look, neither
do I.

02:22.133 --> 02:23.867
Call me back in 30.
Bye.

02:23.867 --> 02:28.833
Can't handle everybody.
Um, did Lam tell you anything

02:28.833 --> 02:31.233
- about our talk today?
- No.

02:31.233 --> 02:32.700
No?
We're gonna, like, proceed with

02:32.700 --> 02:34.667
- our divorce.
- Yeah.

02:34.667 --> 02:37.267
We were talking about
it, and then he was like, "Okay,

02:37.267 --> 02:39.733
well, can you wait to decide
this?"

02:39.733 --> 02:42.100
And I was like, "No, no, no.
We've already decided this.

02:42.100 --> 02:44.333
We talk about this all the time.
It's not a question.

02:44.333 --> 02:47.500
It's happening."
I go, "We don't, like...

02:47.500 --> 02:51.133
This isn't a married couple."
I go, "We're just wasting time."

02:51.133 --> 02:53.367
Lamar's put me through some.

02:53.367 --> 02:57.200
I need this marriage to end,
because it's depressing, but no

02:57.200 --> 02:59.667
one really checks on me.
Everyone just checks on Lamar

02:59.667 --> 03:02.300
and how Lamar's doing, and
that's hard for me.

03:02.300 --> 03:04.267
Does anyone care for my
well-being or, like, my best

03:04.267 --> 03:06.533
interest?
Like, I want a real

03:06.533 --> 03:11.500
relationship, like...
What is there to think about?

03:11.500 --> 03:24.933
- What a life.
- So miserable.

03:24.933 --> 03:26.900
Kourt, show me the
wallpaper.

03:26.900 --> 03:28.967
Okay, so the
countertop's done.

03:28.967 --> 03:32.033
And then this is the wallpaper
that we're doing in here.

03:32.033 --> 03:34.367
- It's literally just suede.
- I love it.

03:34.367 --> 03:36.233
I feel like you've been doing
this room for a long time

03:36.233 --> 03:37.700
- though.
- I know.

03:37.700 --> 03:39.300
- This looks so nice.
- Are you being

03:39.300 --> 03:41.233
- sarcastic?
- No.

03:41.233 --> 03:43.033
Look, this is the
walls.

03:43.033 --> 03:45.600
Then we're wrapping the bar in
this.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.233
Don't make it too
comfortable in here, 'cause she

03:47.233 --> 03:49.567
won't want to leave.
Could we please do something

03:49.567 --> 03:52.567
tonight?
Can you please get out of this,

03:52.567 --> 03:55.000
like, garb?
I moved here for, like, ten days

03:55.000 --> 03:57.667
a month and, like, there's no
plans.

03:57.667 --> 03:59.900
I just, like...
After you have a baby, you just,

03:59.900 --> 04:02.500
- like, you want to stay home.
- You do want to stay

04:02.500 --> 04:04.067
- home after you've had a baby.
- But I stayed...

04:04.067 --> 04:05.400
- I stayed home...
- You're the worst

04:05.400 --> 04:06.867
person to have this argument
with her.

04:06.867 --> 04:08.867
No, 'cause I would
say there's, like, a six month

04:08.867 --> 04:11.667
period where, like, you just
want to stay home.

04:11.667 --> 04:14.433
- Yeah.
- I totally

04:14.433 --> 04:18.067
understand being in mom mode
and just having a baby,

04:18.067 --> 04:23.333
but Jonathan's in town, and he's
used to Kim just hanging out

04:23.333 --> 04:25.100
- with him whenever.
- When are you gonna

04:25.100 --> 04:26.400
be back to normal?
Just give me that.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.867
Stay in mom land as
long as you can because it's the

04:28.867 --> 04:30.333
- best place to be.
- Kourtney, please.

04:30.333 --> 04:32.000
You're the... ugh.
This is the worst person to have

04:32.000 --> 04:33.967
- an argument.
- And you only have

04:33.967 --> 04:35.167
- the excuse...
- When do you think

04:35.167 --> 04:36.767
- you're gonna be ready to go out?
- ...for so little

04:36.767 --> 04:38.033
- of time.
- Look, I'm not

04:38.033 --> 04:39.800
trying to go to the club.
We're just trying to go to

04:39.800 --> 04:41.067
- dinner.
- I don't know what

04:41.067 --> 04:43.033
to tell you.
I used to make fun of Kourtney

04:43.033 --> 04:46.100
all the time for just wanting to
stay home and do mom things,

04:46.100 --> 04:49.300
and now it's like, that's all I
want to do.

04:49.300 --> 04:52.033
It's just, like, too much.
I just want to, like, sit home.

04:52.033 --> 04:54.600
Changing diapers,
being a mother.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.200
- Yeah.
- A good wife.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.867
- Yeah.
- Everything that I

04:57.867 --> 05:06.633
hate.

05:06.633 --> 05:08.700
- Kylie?
- Yeah?

05:08.700 --> 05:10.033
- Open this?
- Of course.

05:10.033 --> 05:11.833
Yeah, all right, I
don't need the whole clan.

05:11.833 --> 05:14.300
This thing is crazy, right?

05:14.300 --> 05:17.000
I want to look what's
in the Easter basket.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.100
- I bet you do.
- Guy's funny.

05:19.100 --> 05:21.700
Once he gets out of the house,
he just wants to find snacks.

05:21.700 --> 05:23.200
- Really?
- Yeah, 'cause Mom

05:23.200 --> 05:24.867
- doesn't let him eat anything.
- Yeah.

05:24.867 --> 05:27.467
- But he can't have gluten.
- Well, says, like,

05:27.467 --> 05:31.867
weird doctors.
Like, spiritual advisor types.

05:31.867 --> 05:35.267
- I like that though.
- I don't.

05:35.267 --> 05:37.267
- You ever been to a psychic?
- No.

05:37.267 --> 05:38.933
I kind of want to go
to one.

05:38.933 --> 05:40.600
Me, too.
I want to go to someone who

05:40.600 --> 05:42.500
tells me about, like, my past
lives and, like...

05:42.500 --> 05:43.800
That's what I'm
saying.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.533
Something like that.
Because you know how everybody

05:45.533 --> 05:48.367
says there's, like, that
Kardashian curse to the men?

05:48.367 --> 05:49.867
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

05:49.867 --> 05:51.833
I don't know, it's
kind of scary, but it's kind of

05:51.833 --> 05:54.167
dope, like, if it actually,
like, had truth to it.

05:54.167 --> 05:58.333
Yeah.
The Kardashian curse is every

05:58.333 --> 06:03.233
male figure that comes and dates
a Kardashian, their life kind of

06:03.233 --> 06:09.867
just goes downhill after that.
I am not against exploring this

06:09.867 --> 06:12.500
- more with Scott.
- You got to go to

06:12.500 --> 06:14.633
- Miss Cleo.
- She's alive?

06:14.633 --> 06:16.900
Yeah, well, how did I become
the dog whisperer?

06:16.900 --> 06:18.400
I will say Norman
loves men.

06:18.400 --> 06:19.967
- Like, he loves men.
- Well, we're not

06:19.967 --> 06:21.667
animals.
There's three animals in the

06:21.667 --> 06:23.767
- house.
- No, we ain't animals.

06:23.767 --> 06:25.533
And I know how to

06:25.533 --> 06:27.433
spell "cat."
C-A-T.

06:27.433 --> 06:30.300
How cool is he?

06:30.300 --> 06:41.233
- Yeah, no, the best.
- He's so cool.

06:41.233 --> 06:44.567
- Jonathan.
- Whoa!

06:44.567 --> 06:47.567
You really dressed up for me.
What time is the royal ball?

06:47.567 --> 06:49.333
Okay.
These people were yelling

06:49.333 --> 06:51.500
"goals" at me and I could not
understand what they were

06:51.500 --> 06:53.900
saying; I'm like, "Why are they
screaming 'gold'?"

06:53.900 --> 06:55.967
And they were like, "Goals!

06:55.967 --> 06:57.900
Your goals!"
And I was like, "Wait, I'm

06:57.900 --> 06:59.200
gold?"
Yeah, they want to

06:59.200 --> 07:01.133
be you, baby.
Your goals.

07:01.133 --> 07:03.467
Wait, I have to tell you,
Kim's really been pissing me

07:03.467 --> 07:04.867
off.
She's literally turned into the

07:04.867 --> 07:06.200
- old you.
- Remember?

07:06.200 --> 07:08.067
You called me "Mommy Mommy."
All the time.

07:08.067 --> 07:11.167
So then she's not only that,
she's worse.

07:11.167 --> 07:14.567
So Kim has turned into, like,
a mother from hell.

07:14.567 --> 07:16.000
A mother...

07:16.000 --> 07:18.733
...stays home with her kids.
A mother from hell would go out

07:18.733 --> 07:20.133
- with you.
- Well, she's a

07:20.133 --> 07:22.067
- mother from hell to me.
- Did you think that she

07:22.067 --> 07:23.933
was gonna be going out every
Friday, Saturday, Sunday?

07:23.933 --> 07:25.800
Like, I'm there,
and she needs to give me some

07:25.800 --> 07:28.233
- attention when I'm there.
- Okay.

07:28.233 --> 07:29.900
She just had a
baby.

07:29.900 --> 07:31.867
- She went from one to two kids.
- Kourtney, listen to

07:31.867 --> 07:34.533
me; I was thinking of getting
one of those people that look

07:34.533 --> 07:35.667
- like Kim.
- Right.

07:35.667 --> 07:37.033
- Like a look-alike?
- Like a look-alike,

07:37.033 --> 07:38.867
- but, like...
- Like a look-alike?

07:38.867 --> 07:40.867
Like a look-alike?

07:40.867 --> 07:42.867
- Like a look-alike?
- Like a look-alike.

07:42.867 --> 07:44.867
And I'm gonna go out with her,
and I know that we're gonna get

07:44.867 --> 07:46.467
photographed, and she's gonna be
so pissed.

07:46.467 --> 07:47.900
Should be constant
Snapchats, too.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.400
Oh, I'm gonna
Snapchat...

07:49.400 --> 07:51.367
- BFFs, squad goals.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:51.367 --> 07:52.600
- Everything.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.033
I think it'd be the funniest
thing.

07:54.033 --> 07:55.467
Do you think Kim
will care?

07:55.467 --> 07:56.833
- Yeah.
- Bitch is  sitting at

07:56.833 --> 07:59.033
home with her kids, being a
mother, while I'm trying to go

07:59.033 --> 08:01.300
hit the town.
I'm ready to trade her in,

08:01.300 --> 08:02.700
for you.

08:02.700 --> 08:04.233
- Because you are, you are...
- Who wouldn't be?

08:04.233 --> 08:05.467
You are the funny
one now.

08:05.467 --> 08:07.967
I can't blame you.
Now?!

08:07.967 --> 08:18.333
Was Kim ever funny?

08:18.333 --> 08:20.433
Feel like I have
heartburn again.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.833
- What is going on?
- It's probably because

08:22.833 --> 08:25.500
you have so many things going on
inside your body.

08:25.500 --> 08:28.367
Hormones are changing, your
insides are changing.

08:28.367 --> 08:30.067
- Yeah.
- You know your necklace

08:30.067 --> 08:32.567
doesn't say "Saint."
I just have to shorten

08:32.567 --> 08:34.300
- one.
- Oh, there.

08:34.300 --> 08:36.900
- It's so cute.
- I feel so bad for Khloe.

08:36.900 --> 08:39.933
She's been, like, so stressed
out and so overwhelmed.

08:39.933 --> 08:42.033
- Yeah, I know.
- Because she has, like,

08:42.033 --> 08:44.167
- you know, Lamar.
- I know.

08:44.167 --> 08:48.300
She needs to also just take a
minute and not be doing that

08:48.300 --> 08:51.667
- all the time.
- Khloe's in such an

08:51.667 --> 08:54.567
awkward position 'cause they
were getting a divorce before,

08:54.567 --> 08:58.467
and then they called it off
when Lamar was really sick, and

08:58.467 --> 09:01.100
now that he's doing better,
they're not, like...

09:01.100 --> 09:05.133
intimately together, so does she
still stick with staying married

09:05.133 --> 09:07.933
to him, does she re-file for
divorce?

09:07.933 --> 09:10.300
Like, what is the right move for
her to make?

09:10.300 --> 09:11.867
I just don't know what
to do.

09:11.867 --> 09:15.067
She called me this morning,
just... ready to hit a wall.

09:15.067 --> 09:17.000
It's like she's super
stressed.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.333
I feel like she just needs,
like, a girls' day.

09:19.333 --> 09:21.300
I know.
Everybody needs a little bit of

09:21.300 --> 09:22.633
- downtime.
- Yeah.

09:22.633 --> 09:24.733
So, it's almost like,
maybe if we plan something

09:24.733 --> 09:27.833
and just get away for a minute.
She's never gonna take any time

09:27.833 --> 09:31.033
- off by herself.
- I feel really, really

09:31.033 --> 09:34.067
bad for Khloe.
She doesn't want to create any

09:34.067 --> 09:37.300
situation that would, like,
cause him to be depressed or go

09:37.300 --> 09:41.733
back into any kind of, like, old
bad habits, and just feels like

09:41.733 --> 09:44.867
it'll be her fault if something
happens, but she's also missing

09:44.867 --> 09:48.133
out so much on her life.
She has, like, all these crazy

09:48.133 --> 09:51.267
- life decisions to make.
- She's definitely bit

09:51.267 --> 09:55.900
- off more than she can chew.
- You guys think nothing

09:55.900 --> 09:58.100
- is ever wrong.
- A Kardashian curse?

09:58.100 --> 10:00.033
- It's not real.
- Are you joking?

10:00.033 --> 10:04.400
- I'm offended.
- I love Lamar with all

10:04.400 --> 10:07.600
of my heart and I want the best
for him, but I'm tired of

10:07.600 --> 10:09.500
feeling trapped.

10:19.633 --> 10:22.833
Do I want to do a
Make-A-Wish thing at my house?

10:22.833 --> 10:24.733
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

10:24.733 --> 10:26.733
Sure, that's okay, and we will

10:26.733 --> 10:29.333
do, like, donuts, comma,
cookies...

10:29.333 --> 10:30.500
Cupcakes.
How old is she?

10:30.500 --> 10:31.833
Shut up.

10:31.833 --> 10:33.533
- The thing was talking.
- Oh.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.600
- I'm sorry.
- Cupcakes...

10:35.600 --> 10:37.967
See, this is what's
wrong with you in your life.

10:37.967 --> 10:40.867
Every time you have five minutes
to yourself, you fill it up with

10:40.867 --> 10:42.400
something else, and then you get
overwhelmed.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.667
It's a Make-A-Wish
person though.

10:43.667 --> 10:45.133
- No, no, I know.
- What am I gonna do,

10:45.133 --> 10:46.533
- not do that?
- Of course you're gonna

10:46.533 --> 10:49.600
do it, but I'm just saying,
every once in a while, even you

10:49.600 --> 10:54.467
need to take a break.
I need to take you away.

10:54.467 --> 10:58.967
I think that sometimes, because
you're there every single day

10:58.967 --> 11:02.267
and doing such an amazing job
with Lamar, that you don't

11:02.267 --> 11:05.033
realize that you, too, need a
break once in a while.

11:05.033 --> 11:07.500
Oh, I do realize it.
That's why I snap.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.533
Exactly.
So we are gonna go to Napa, and

11:10.533 --> 11:13.933
we're gonna go wine tasting and
just have a fabulous time

11:13.933 --> 11:16.733
together.
Deal?

11:16.733 --> 11:19.500
I agree with my mom
that I need to get away, I just

11:19.500 --> 11:22.067
feel like, is now really the
right time to go?

11:22.067 --> 11:24.967
But it's a 45-minute flight if
anything happens, and I actually

11:24.967 --> 11:27.633
just feel really relieved to get
away from all the Lamar stuff

11:27.633 --> 11:29.633
- for a minute.
- So, I'll plan the whole

11:29.633 --> 11:33.333
thing, and at the end of it, I
hope you'll say, "You were

11:33.333 --> 11:34.833
right, Mom."
"Mom, that was the

11:34.833 --> 11:37.433
best trip ever."
You know what, I think

11:37.433 --> 11:40.233
you've had way too much Diet
Snapple.

11:40.233 --> 11:51.367
Yeah, okay, I'm making plans,
kiddo, so get ready.

11:51.367 --> 11:53.200
Welcome to the
house.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.700
The location here is one second
from everywhere.

11:55.700 --> 11:56.967
- Yeah.
- I could walk to

11:56.967 --> 11:58.167
- Beverly Hills if I want.
- Really?

11:58.167 --> 11:59.767
- Yeah.
- So, what's up?

11:59.767 --> 12:01.867
Wait, hold on.
So, you know, 'cause everybody

12:01.867 --> 12:05.767
wants a butt, so Dr. Ourian
bought this factory, and he made

12:05.767 --> 12:08.333
these that you can't see,
like, for girls that can't

12:08.333 --> 12:10.900
afford butts, like, to lift
their ass, so I'm gonna make

12:10.900 --> 12:12.467
- this...
- So, does it lift

12:12.467 --> 12:13.800
- it and pad it?
- Yeah.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.333
No, no, it pads it, but it gives
you like a, like, nice high ass.

12:16.333 --> 12:18.367
- Will you try it on?
- Give me the black

12:18.367 --> 12:21.600
one.
What I have now is all muscle.

12:21.600 --> 12:23.367
- Oh, damn!
- No, I don't know

12:23.367 --> 12:24.633
- if that is...
- You look like Naomi

12:24.633 --> 12:26.033
- Campbell.
- Holy!

12:26.033 --> 12:27.833
Drop it like it's
hot.

12:27.833 --> 12:29.400
- Oh. It's...
- It does keep...

12:29.400 --> 12:31.067
Damn, you go down
low!

12:31.067 --> 12:33.267
You're like a  stripper
at King of Diamonds on Monday

12:33.267 --> 12:35.433
- nights in Miami.
- Now I'm really

12:35.433 --> 12:37.667
- ready for a nap.
- Well, thanks for

12:37.667 --> 12:38.667
- hanging out.
- Yeah.

12:38.667 --> 12:40.267
Well, this girl's
coming, but I didn't want to

12:40.267 --> 12:41.567
- meet her alone.
- Wait, she's coming

12:41.567 --> 12:42.767
- here?
- No, no, we're

12:42.767 --> 12:43.867
- hanging out.
- You two?

12:43.867 --> 12:45.933
With Dr. Ourian.
I really want to piss Kim off.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.933
I hope she really looks like
her.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.167
This is so exciting.
Sucks that you have so many kids

12:50.167 --> 12:52.633
and you can't hang out with me
all the time when I'm here.

12:52.633 --> 12:54.200
It sucks that I
have kids?!

12:54.200 --> 13:03.300
- So many.
- Oh.

13:03.300 --> 13:05.200
Oh, wow, I've never
seen his room.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.667
- Aren't you going to Dubai?
- Yeah, man.

13:07.667 --> 13:09.267
How long are you gonna
stay in Dubai for?

13:09.267 --> 13:10.800
- Like, four days.
- Why didn't you want to

13:10.800 --> 13:12.067
- go, Kylie?
- She used to travel the

13:12.067 --> 13:13.600
- world with me.
- I've been everywhere

13:13.600 --> 13:15.567
- with him.
- Trust me, it only gets

13:15.567 --> 13:17.533
worse, buddy.
They just keep getting meaner.

13:17.533 --> 13:19.033
I think she's
different.

13:19.033 --> 13:20.633
- And meaner and meaner.
- Can't be no worse than

13:20.633 --> 13:22.667
- you.
- You've never seen me

13:22.667 --> 13:24.833
- say one bad thing to anybody.
- What?!

13:24.833 --> 13:26.933
What?!
These two girls went up to him

13:26.933 --> 13:29.467
and asked for a photo, and he's
in the photo right before they

13:29.467 --> 13:33.133
take it, he goes, "Psych! I'm
not taking a  photo with

13:33.133 --> 13:35.467
you," and he runs away.

13:35.467 --> 13:37.533
Oh, wait.
The psychic guy that I called is

13:37.533 --> 13:40.667
- here.
- Hello!

13:40.667 --> 13:41.967
- Hi, I'm Scott.
- Brett.

13:41.967 --> 13:43.400
Hey, how you are?
Nice to see you.

13:43.400 --> 13:44.533
- I'm Kylie.
- Hi, Kylie.

13:44.533 --> 13:45.867
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

13:45.867 --> 13:47.000
- Hi, Ty.
- Tyga.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.333
- Oh, Tyga.
- But you already knew

13:48.333 --> 13:49.667
- that.
- What's that?

13:49.667 --> 13:51.500
Nothing, don't worry.

13:51.500 --> 13:53.200
He's funny.
He's got jokes.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.333
- I'll just get started.
- Okay.

13:55.333 --> 13:57.400
I feel very drawn to
you specifically about

13:57.400 --> 14:00.000
relationships in general,
whether it's with your family or

14:00.000 --> 14:02.933
whether it's with your partner,
or, like, whoever it is, things

14:02.933 --> 14:06.000
are just kind of going in a very
different way that's not giving

14:06.000 --> 14:08.467
you the clarity that you're
looking for.

14:08.467 --> 14:10.533
I mean, I think
everybody kind of feels

14:10.533 --> 14:12.767
- that way, right?
- Uh, yeah.

14:12.767 --> 14:15.833
It gets really kind of
confusing.

14:15.833 --> 14:19.200
It's almost as if I have a lens
going on in one eye, and then I

14:19.200 --> 14:21.967
have a lens in the other eye,
and I'm looking in two different

14:21.967 --> 14:24.200
lenses, and it makes it very
unclear.

14:24.200 --> 14:28.200
- Correct?
- Um, I guess you could

14:28.200 --> 14:31.000
- say that.
- Okay.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.933
I feel like everybody
that's dated any girl within her

14:34.933 --> 14:38.100
family has gotten some kind of
curse.

14:38.100 --> 14:40.033
That's what we're kind of more
trying to get into.

14:40.033 --> 14:42.667
That's up to you
to understand for yourself.

14:42.667 --> 14:46.500
You are the person who's in
charge of your own ship, so

14:46.500 --> 14:49.767
nothing can bump you off except
your perception that somebody

14:49.767 --> 14:52.967
else is taking the ship over.
Do you understand what I mean by

14:52.967 --> 14:55.100
- that?
- I get that.

14:55.100 --> 14:58.500
- Tell me something I don't know.
- Um...

14:58.500 --> 15:00.567
What's the definition
of what you do, exactly?

15:00.567 --> 15:02.667
A spiritual medium.
So I feel and sense...

15:02.667 --> 15:04.767
Yeah, I think we,
like, called the wrong number.

15:04.767 --> 15:06.367
- Oh, you did?
- I think we wanted just

15:06.367 --> 15:08.367
- a psychic.
- Okay.

15:08.367 --> 15:10.367
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

15:10.367 --> 15:12.300
I asked one of the
girls that works for me to find

15:12.300 --> 15:15.033
a good psychic.
Evidently, she went the complete

15:15.033 --> 15:18.967
opposite direction and found the
worst guy maybe ever for what I

15:18.967 --> 15:21.600
need.
That's ridiculous.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.400
We weren't looking for that.
I just wanted a little guy with,

15:23.400 --> 15:25.067
like, a little crystal ball to
come in here and be, like...

15:25.067 --> 15:26.600
- Yeah, like...
- What's up, baby?

15:26.600 --> 15:28.567
You need to get, like,
a old lady with long hair.

15:28.567 --> 15:29.667
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:29.667 --> 15:32.000
- I want a freaky witch.
- Like a little woman.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.600
- Get a real, like...
- With, like, a cape on.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.800
- Got, like, ten cats.
- Yeah. Cats everywhere.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.700
You know what I mean?

15:44.433 --> 15:47.100
Okay, I come back
in a few minutes?

15:47.100 --> 15:49.467
- Okay, cool.
- Oh, it's so cute

15:49.467 --> 15:51.067
- here.
- What are you doing

15:51.067 --> 16:00.300
- here?
- What are you doing here?

16:00.300 --> 16:03.200
You do have a curse.
Your reading is talking about a

16:03.200 --> 16:05.567
- rooster.
- I think Scott is

16:05.567 --> 16:08.633
- going crazy.
- Hey, Kris.

16:08.633 --> 16:11.033
- We're going to dinner.
- The thing about my mom

16:11.033 --> 16:13.167
is that she has great
intentions, and I know she just

16:13.167 --> 16:16.733
wants to take Lamar out
somewhere, but this whole point

16:16.733 --> 16:24.967
of this trip is to kind of,
like, de-stress me.

16:24.967 --> 16:27.733
What are you doing
here?

16:27.733 --> 16:30.033
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, hello.

16:30.033 --> 16:32.000
- What?!
- Hi.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.533
No, no, this was not
planned.

16:33.533 --> 16:34.600
- Really?
- I cannot...

16:34.600 --> 16:36.067
I thought that was
your... I was gonna say that

16:36.067 --> 16:37.367
looks like Kim's car, but I
was like no.

16:37.367 --> 16:38.867
- That's so crazy.
- Kourtney just called me

16:38.867 --> 16:40.167
and said they're on their way to
Ourian's.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.933
I was like, "Wait, I'm-I'm...
I'm here with a friend."

16:41.933 --> 16:43.967
Oh, you brought
somebody here? Stop!

16:43.967 --> 16:46.000
Yeah. That-That's so
funny.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.633
This whole thing is
weird and funny.

16:47.633 --> 16:49.033
- Yeah.
- Well, there's Kim.

16:49.033 --> 16:50.967
- Yeah, well, hello.
- Nice to meet you.

16:50.967 --> 16:55.800
Nice to meet you,
too, finally.

16:55.800 --> 16:58.333
I was gonna just, I
was taking her with me,

16:58.333 --> 16:59.867
- 'cause...
- He wanted to show

16:59.867 --> 17:01.533
- me...
- Yeah, 'cause...

17:01.533 --> 17:05.533
- Yeah, we just hit the town.
- This is super awkward.

17:05.533 --> 17:09.267
The fact that Jonathan would
take it to this level is so

17:09.267 --> 17:11.867
- bizarre to me.
- We were just coming

17:11.867 --> 17:14.333
in 'cause I wanted Dr. Ourian to
just, like, look at my eye right

17:14.333 --> 17:16.333
here, see if we wanted to do a
little laser.

17:16.333 --> 17:19.233
So I was taking her with me,
'cause you're too busy to hang

17:19.233 --> 17:21.867
out with me, but meanwhile,
you're here hanging out with

17:21.867 --> 17:25.833
somebody, so now I'm pissed.
I just realized I nailed her!

17:25.833 --> 17:28.367
'Cause I'm so, I was so shocked.
But I realize that...

17:28.367 --> 17:30.500
He was like, "She
doesn't chill with me."

17:30.500 --> 17:33.033
Yeah, are you
kidding me?

17:33.033 --> 17:35.833
You're so ridiculous.

17:35.833 --> 17:39.600
Jonathan's trying to rub this in
my face and make me feel some

17:39.600 --> 17:43.667
type of way, but I don't.
Having two kids is a lot, and,

17:43.667 --> 17:46.033
like, your priorities just
change.

17:46.033 --> 17:47.900
Well, we had a
great lunch.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.200
- We had fun.
- So much fun.

17:50.200 --> 17:53.467
- We have to take a pic.
- We do.

17:53.467 --> 17:56.333
I mean, Jonathan can try

17:56.333 --> 17:59.167
all he wants to go and replace
me, but he can't.

17:59.167 --> 18:02.267
- Go try, honey, go try.
- All right.

18:02.267 --> 18:03.300
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

18:03.300 --> 18:04.500
- See ya later.
- Nice to meet you.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.733
So nice to meet you,
too.

18:05.733 --> 18:07.467
- Bye, guys, bye.
- All right,

18:07.467 --> 18:08.733
see you later.
We don't need Kim.

18:08.733 --> 18:10.233
- Let's go do our own stuff.
- That's right, no

18:10.233 --> 18:12.133
Kim.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.867
Oh, my God, look at
her hat box.

18:23.867 --> 18:26.033
Wait.
Let me snap Mom.

18:26.033 --> 18:28.167
Where is she going?
She's really, like, from

18:28.167 --> 18:30.567
- Breakfast with Tiffany's.
- Hello.

18:30.567 --> 18:32.067
- Hello.
- How are you?

18:32.067 --> 18:35.033
- Shoot. Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Audrey.

18:35.033 --> 18:37.933
- How are you?
- Audrey, how are you?

18:37.933 --> 18:40.433
I'm fine, darling.
How are you?

18:40.433 --> 18:43.933
Wow. Fancy.
I'm confused if you're going to

18:43.933 --> 18:47.133
a Western or a... or a New York
Fashion Week.

18:47.133 --> 18:49.133
I'm... it's a little
bit of both.

18:49.133 --> 18:51.767
What are we talking
about here?

18:51.767 --> 18:55.567
Let's go to freaking Napa.

18:55.567 --> 18:59.267
Never been to Napa,
and there's nobody that's more

18:59.267 --> 19:02.033
fun to hang out with than my mom
and Khloe.

19:02.033 --> 19:06.133
Khloe's been so stressed out,
and I think just seeing her

19:06.133 --> 19:10.133
let loose, drink some wine,
like, just not care about

19:10.133 --> 19:13.100
anything.
It's, like, one day of just

19:13.100 --> 19:16.933
having a great time.
I'm so hungover.

19:16.933 --> 19:19.833
- Why?
- I went to the show.

19:19.833 --> 19:22.433
- I'm so tired.
- Was it worth it?

19:22.433 --> 19:30.700
- Was it a good show?
- Yeah.

19:30.700 --> 19:34.033
Look how pretty this
is; it's so green.

19:34.033 --> 19:36.300
- It's so green.
- I'm excited you guys

19:36.300 --> 19:38.200
- are doing this with me.
- I'm excited to be

19:38.200 --> 19:42.300
here.
Kourt's never been here.

19:42.300 --> 19:44.533
- Look at this place.
- Hello, guv'nah.

19:44.533 --> 19:47.533
Hi, little lady.

19:47.533 --> 19:49.133
- Hi there.
- Hi, Dave, how are you?

19:49.133 --> 19:50.367
- I'm Kris.
- Hi, Kris, nice to see

19:50.367 --> 19:51.667
- you. Welcome, welcome.
- Nice to see you, too.

19:51.667 --> 19:52.867
- Thank you for having us.
- Our pleasure.

19:52.867 --> 19:54.000
This is Khloe and
Kourtney.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.133
- Hi. Kourtney.
- Kourtney.

19:55.133 --> 19:56.300
- Hi. Khloe.
- The little one is

19:56.300 --> 19:57.533
- Kourtney.
- Khloe, nice to see you.

19:57.533 --> 19:59.367
- Okay.
- The little one.

19:59.367 --> 20:01.300
- The big one is Khloe.
- What is that?

20:01.300 --> 20:03.133
This is the entrance to
the sacred cave here.

20:03.133 --> 20:05.600
- Oh. Fancy entrance.
- Get ready, you guys,

20:05.600 --> 20:07.733
because what you're gonna see
here is gonna blow your mind.

20:07.733 --> 20:09.067
- Oh, my.
- Okay, are you ready?

20:09.067 --> 20:10.467
- It's a wine spa.
- This is our wine spa.

20:10.467 --> 20:11.800
- We're getting a wine...
- Here we go.

20:11.800 --> 20:14.767
- Oh! Oh, my God.
- Every barrel

20:14.767 --> 20:16.267
- has wine in it?
- Yes, it does.

20:16.267 --> 20:18.700
We're gonna try some of this
beautiful wine out of the

20:18.700 --> 20:21.267
barrel.
And this is a Cabernet

20:21.267 --> 20:24.600
Sauvignon, and this is a special
French barrel called Picard.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.400
Oh, I like this.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.300
I have a barrel
and it's so good, it tastes

20:28.300 --> 20:31.633
like smoked ham.

20:31.633 --> 20:33.300
This is another
Cabernet.

20:33.300 --> 20:36.433
Being hungover and
wine-tasting probably isn't the

20:36.433 --> 20:40.300
best combination, but Khloe and
I, we just, like, are

20:40.300 --> 20:43.433
entertaining ourselves, and
having the best day.

20:43.433 --> 20:46.000
Oh, you want to play
the game.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.800
No. I'm just giving
you five.

20:51.300 --> 20:54.967
- Oh, my gosh.
- It smells like we just

20:54.967 --> 21:00.600
- had a cigarette.
- Guggenheigen!

21:00.600 --> 21:03.467
- What?
- Guggenhei...

21:03.467 --> 21:05.933
- You guys are so lame.
- We want to know

21:05.933 --> 21:11.067
- what...
- What color is your?

21:11.067 --> 21:14.233
Is it, is your
the color of flamingo or

21:14.233 --> 21:17.733
- bougainvillea?
- Or is your  the color of

21:17.733 --> 21:21.667
ballerinas or gingham green?

21:21.667 --> 21:25.167
I don't know why we
just find it so funny to

21:25.167 --> 21:29.067
FaceTime everyone we know and,
like, ask them what color

21:29.067 --> 21:31.333
- vaginas they like.
- >> KHLOE:

21:31.333 --> 21:33.867
- Oh, my God, it is the queen.
- Kylie Jenner, Kylie

21:33.867 --> 21:35.333
- Jenner.
- The queen of pussy

21:35.333 --> 21:38.100
willow, the queen of pussy
willow.

21:38.100 --> 21:43.033
Is your  pink, Kylie?
Or if it looks like this, we've

21:43.033 --> 21:45.133
- got a problem.
- We have a major

21:45.133 --> 21:46.300
problem.
It looks like...

21:46.300 --> 21:48.867
We've got a problem.

21:48.867 --> 21:51.600
She hung up on us.
Let's call Kendall.

21:51.600 --> 21:54.767
- What's up?
- We need to know

21:54.767 --> 21:57.567
what color is your.
Is it this

21:57.567 --> 22:00.300
- color?
- Hot pink.

22:00.300 --> 22:02.033
- So good.
- Isn't that good?

22:02.033 --> 22:04.000
Isn't this guy...
I thought you'd like that.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.600
I think my mom is
really into wine in general.

22:06.600 --> 22:11.233
And she definitely just could go
on and on, and Khloe and I just

22:11.233 --> 22:15.467
- want to, like, explore Napa.
- Like, where's my

22:15.467 --> 22:19.100
sunglasses?
Oh.

22:19.100 --> 22:20.667
Hey, mate.

22:20.667 --> 22:22.967
- Oh, look at the queen.
- The drunk is

22:22.967 --> 22:24.600
- coming. The drunk. The drunk.
- The drunk is coming.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.067
- The drunk.
- You think we're

22:26.067 --> 22:27.600
- drunk?
- The drunk.

22:27.600 --> 22:30.300
Oh, hello,
mother!

22:30.300 --> 22:35.700
Hello, mother!

22:35.700 --> 22:37.867
Oh,.
Where are my sunglasses?

22:37.867 --> 22:40.433
I'm wearing your
sunglasses, you idiot.

22:40.433 --> 22:43.467
Oh. I have been...
I-I've...

22:43.467 --> 22:46.000
- , Mom!
- Let me see this.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.867
I have been in this
winery for 35 minutes looking

22:49.867 --> 22:54.300
for my sunglasses that my
daughter now tells me she has on

22:54.300 --> 22:58.167
her face.

22:58.167 --> 23:01.200
A walkie-talkie.
Oh, wow. Oh, wow.

23:01.200 --> 23:05.800
- A walkie-talkie. Walkie-talkie.
- Walkie  talkie.

23:05.800 --> 23:09.433
They're making fun of me now.

23:09.433 --> 23:11.567
- It's fine. Whatever.
- No one's making fun of

23:11.567 --> 23:14.367
- you, you psycho.
- Oh, psycho.

23:14.367 --> 23:25.267
I'm literally
crying.

23:25.267 --> 23:27.267
What the
picture is this?

23:27.267 --> 23:29.067
- Rob sent you that?
- Yeah.

23:29.067 --> 23:30.667
How crazy that he's,
like, out.

23:30.667 --> 23:33.300
- I know.
- It's  crazy.

23:33.300 --> 23:35.367
He wouldn't even
show up to his own birthday

23:35.367 --> 23:36.433
- party last year...
- At his home.

23:36.433 --> 23:37.833
...at mom's house.
Yeah.

23:37.833 --> 23:40.567
I mean, I'm just happy
that he's, like, alive again.

23:40.567 --> 23:42.267
- Right?
- It's just so crazy

23:42.267 --> 23:43.900
that it was, like, kind of
overnight and I was, like...

23:43.900 --> 23:46.100
He missed three
years of life, like, actually.

23:46.100 --> 23:48.900
Literally.
Like, three years passed him by.

23:48.900 --> 23:50.833
I get nervous,
though, since it's because of a

23:50.833 --> 23:52.267
- relationship.
- Totally.

23:52.267 --> 23:53.400
- If anything happened...
Uh-huh.

23:53.400 --> 23:54.867
...it's, like, really
taking it back.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.733
Like, probably worse
than before.

23:56.733 --> 23:58.300
I know.
Trust me, I think about that all

23:58.300 --> 24:00.000
- the time.
- It scares me.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.900
Yeah.

24:08.533 --> 24:10.767
All right, Ken.
Ready for me to get this curse

24:10.767 --> 24:12.667
- off my back?
- Yeah.

24:12.667 --> 24:15.433
- Wait, what curse?
- The Kardashian curse.

24:15.433 --> 24:17.600
- There's a curse?
- Anybody that's dated a

24:17.600 --> 24:20.100
Kardashian-- including Rob,
that's a boy-- has gotten

24:20.100 --> 24:23.333
cursed.
After this last guy, I had to

24:23.333 --> 24:27.067
take matters into my own hands,
and I found somebody who does,

24:27.067 --> 24:29.433
you know, the card reading and
really gets to the bottom of

24:29.433 --> 24:31.700
curses.
So I was like, "Kendall, come

24:31.700 --> 24:34.067
with me and let's figure this
out and see if this is real or

24:34.067 --> 24:35.867
not."
There's something going on in

24:35.867 --> 24:37.500
- the water.
- No.

24:37.500 --> 24:39.500
There's no way.
I've never heard about this

24:39.500 --> 24:42.067
before, and I think Scott is
going crazy.

24:42.067 --> 24:44.367
So what would you
like me to look at first?

24:44.367 --> 24:47.567
I feel like some curse
has been put upon me, along with

24:47.567 --> 24:49.933
a lot of other men that I'm
close with.

24:49.933 --> 24:52.233
Okay.
Let me take a look at it and see

24:52.233 --> 24:54.133
what I get.

25:05.300 --> 25:09.867
Um, the cards talk about a load

25:09.867 --> 25:12.300
of negative energy that's been
going on.

25:12.300 --> 25:15.933
Um, then in the center of the
spread comes up the Devil card,

25:15.933 --> 25:18.733
which means there's definitely
an energy that's been following

25:18.733 --> 25:20.500
you around.
It says that everything that you

25:20.500 --> 25:24.467
try to do, you have a tendency
to have, um, many obstacles in

25:24.467 --> 25:29.233
front of you.
So, to answer your question, I

25:29.233 --> 25:34.167
would probably say you do have a
curse.

25:34.167 --> 25:36.667
- Mm.
- Okay?

25:36.667 --> 25:39.400
You know, right off
the bat, she confirms that there

25:39.400 --> 25:42.967
is a curse, so I think she's
pretty good.

25:42.967 --> 25:46.100
So to take care of
that, your reading is talking

25:46.100 --> 25:49.933
about working with Ogun.
It's an offering that you do

25:49.933 --> 25:52.800
- with a rooster.
- So, like, a real...

25:52.800 --> 25:54.800
- rooster?
- A real rooster.

25:54.800 --> 25:57.867
- Kosher or not?
- It could be kosher,

25:57.867 --> 26:00.200
if you like.
Make sure he's alive.

26:00.200 --> 26:03.500
Okay.
Everything seemed pretty normal

26:03.500 --> 26:07.267
with this psychic, but I need to
get a rooster?

26:07.267 --> 26:09.900
- I guess I'll try anything.
- When you do that

26:09.900 --> 26:11.933
kind of offering, you have to be
dressed in white.

26:11.933 --> 26:13.300
Then we kill the
rooster or no?

26:13.300 --> 26:15.900
- No, we set him free.
- That's not so bad.

26:15.900 --> 26:18.433
You know, the
rooster carries what you have.

26:18.433 --> 26:22.533
It sets you free as you set him
free and off he goes.

26:22.533 --> 26:24.367
All right, I hope it
works.

26:24.367 --> 26:25.967
If it does, I'll be a very happy
man.

26:25.967 --> 26:28.067
Even though I'm not
sure that this curse is real, I

26:28.067 --> 26:30.767
just really hope he goes through
with the ritual, 'cause all that

26:30.767 --> 26:33.233
I'm picturing is Scott holding a
little rooster in a little white

26:33.233 --> 26:35.067
- gown.
- And then, uh, that's

26:35.067 --> 26:37.867
followed with an herbal bath
that you do to kind of clear

26:37.867 --> 26:40.767
- that energy that you...
- I got to shower now?

26:40.767 --> 26:44.133
Yeah, you have to
shower.

26:44.133 --> 26:46.033
Wow-wow.

26:52.467 --> 26:54.033
This is the best
video.

26:54.033 --> 26:56.633
A wa... a wa...
a walkie-talkie?

26:56.633 --> 27:00.833
This is cute.

27:00.833 --> 27:02.767
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

27:02.767 --> 27:06.333
- Hi.
- Hi, welcome.

27:06.333 --> 27:08.767
- Thanks. Hi!
- Hi.

27:08.767 --> 27:10.367
Thank you.
Hi, Khloe.

27:10.367 --> 27:11.667
- Hi.
- Nice to see you.

27:11.667 --> 27:14.200
- How are you?
- Hi, I'm Angela with

27:14.200 --> 27:15.567
"Promise Wine."
Hi, nice to meet you.

27:15.567 --> 27:17.500
It's beautiful in
here. Yeah.

27:17.500 --> 27:20.000
Oscar and I are gonna
come by with some wines.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.900
You're gonna have a lot, so look
at the sea of glasses, right?

27:22.900 --> 27:24.800
- Oh, my goodness.
- Kourtney, are you

27:24.800 --> 27:26.067
- excited?
- No.

27:26.067 --> 27:27.400
Kourtney's a little
hungover, just to...

27:27.400 --> 27:28.767
- I am.
- ...let you guys know.

27:28.767 --> 27:30.000
But you want to know
what?

27:30.000 --> 27:31.233
Then they call this the hair of
dog.

27:31.233 --> 27:32.800
It looks like she's
having a tough time.

27:32.800 --> 27:34.667
- I am.
- We do have a bucket.

27:34.667 --> 27:36.700
Yeah.
I'm gonna need a bucket later.

27:36.700 --> 27:38.700
- Hello. How are you?
- This looks beautiful.

27:38.700 --> 27:39.933
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

27:39.933 --> 27:42.533
This is a garden green
salad from our garden with, uh,

27:42.533 --> 27:45.633
- roasted beets.
- Looks really good.

27:45.633 --> 27:47.900
- You okay, Kourt?
Mm-hmm.

27:47.900 --> 27:51.433
- I'm, like, ready to go to bed.
- Count me in, Seymour.

27:51.433 --> 27:53.367
Remember when Kourtney lived
next door to Seymour Butts?

27:53.367 --> 27:55.933
Mm-hmm.

27:55.933 --> 27:57.600
They used to film
pornos in his backyard.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.200
Then I told
everyone that he taught me how

27:59.200 --> 28:00.800
- to squirt.
- Well, what's squirting?

28:00.800 --> 28:02.733
Why don't you ask
Corey to show you?

28:02.733 --> 28:06.233
How are the wines?

28:06.233 --> 28:07.267
Good.

28:07.267 --> 28:08.633
- Oh, really good.
- I see that you're

28:08.633 --> 28:10.333
pacing yourself throughout now,
but that's very good.

28:10.333 --> 28:12.100
- Hello?
- Hey.

28:12.100 --> 28:14.600
- Miss you.
- Miss you, too, Kourt.

28:14.600 --> 28:17.200
- How are you doing?
- I'm doing fine.

28:17.200 --> 28:19.233
- Hi.
- Hey, Kris.

28:19.233 --> 28:21.267
- We're going to dinner.
- Are we?

28:21.267 --> 28:24.600
We could go-- he would
like Craig's.

28:24.600 --> 28:27.733
What about Nice Guy, Kourtney's
favorite?

28:27.733 --> 28:29.533
My mom is just crazy
right now.

28:29.533 --> 28:31.100
I have an Italian place
that nobody knows about that's a

28:31.100 --> 28:34.333
- mile away from the house.
- The thing about my mom

28:34.333 --> 28:36.467
is that she has great
intentions and I know she just

28:36.467 --> 28:39.700
wants to take Lamar out
somewhere, but Lamar has to

28:39.700 --> 28:43.033
focus on trying to be sober.
I need Lamar to make these

28:43.033 --> 28:46.033
- changes to better himself.
- I mean, a lot of  has

28:46.033 --> 28:50.567
happened that I can't forget.
No virgin Roman Punches, okay?

28:50.567 --> 28:52.333
- Why not?
- 'Cause I don't think

28:52.333 --> 28:55.500
you stop there.
I don't want to take that risk.

28:55.500 --> 28:58.767
- It's that hard for you?
- Nah.

28:58.767 --> 29:00.533
Okay, Virgin Rum,
peace.

29:00.533 --> 29:02.933
Bye-bye, Khloe.
- Ugh.

29:02.933 --> 29:05.867
This guy.
See, why would you say to take

29:05.867 --> 29:10.233
him to Craig's?
I want to hang out with him

29:10.233 --> 29:12.933
privately just 'cause I'm
allowed to be friends with him,

29:12.933 --> 29:14.533
but why do I want that in the
atmosphere and all this

29:14.533 --> 29:15.733
- pressure?
- Yeah, I got it.

29:15.733 --> 29:17.067
So there's this little place
right by our house...

29:17.067 --> 29:18.700
But if you get it,
get it.

29:18.700 --> 29:20.600
Okay.

29:24.333 --> 29:26.200
You go first.

29:26.200 --> 29:28.767
I'm not gonna lie,
I really don't know a ton about

29:28.767 --> 29:30.600
roosters.
Is that a boy or a girl?

29:30.600 --> 29:31.700
Whoa!
Hey!

29:31.700 --> 29:35.633
They have a return policy?

29:35.633 --> 29:38.767
It's so hard and I
feel so much pressure.

29:38.767 --> 29:41.733
I just want to support him and
take care of him, but I just

29:41.733 --> 29:52.700
want someone to just, like, care
about me a little, too.

29:52.700 --> 29:55.533
Who knew you could
just go get roosters?

29:55.533 --> 29:58.767
I usually don't go rooster
shopping, but I figured I'd

29:58.767 --> 30:00.800
bring my friend Benny and I
guess it's a pretty hot item

30:00.800 --> 30:02.233
right now.
Hey, how are you?

30:02.233 --> 30:03.567
Micah. Nice to meet
you.

30:03.567 --> 30:04.900
Nice to meet you guys.
Marco.

30:04.900 --> 30:06.100
Marco, nice to meet
you.

30:06.100 --> 30:07.333
Nice to meet you, too,
guys.

30:07.333 --> 30:08.700
So, I'm looking for a
rooster.

30:08.700 --> 30:10.767
Well, here they are.
Beautiful Rhode Island Red

30:10.767 --> 30:12.100
- Roosters.
- Are they nasty?

30:12.100 --> 30:13.333
You know, they're
roosters.

30:13.333 --> 30:15.500
They're not gonna be the super
friendliest, but they're not

30:15.500 --> 30:16.967
gonna, like, bite you or
anything.

30:16.967 --> 30:19.867
You go first.

30:19.867 --> 30:21.200
- Whoa.
- If you want, you can

30:21.200 --> 30:24.467
- grab it with your own hands.
- Uh... what's protocol?

30:24.467 --> 30:28.567
I'm not gonna lie, I really
don't know a ton about roosters.

30:28.567 --> 30:30.633
Place your hands the
same way that I'm kind of doing

30:30.633 --> 30:32.067
it.
You want to squeeze a little bit

30:32.067 --> 30:33.267
- harder.
- Squeeze a little bit

30:33.267 --> 30:34.433
- harder.
- But not too hard.

30:34.433 --> 30:35.800
- But just...
- He's got a good girth

30:35.800 --> 30:38.933
on him.
For sure this is the one.

30:38.933 --> 30:40.567
- That's the one.
- This one's gonna save

30:40.567 --> 30:42.133
my life.
He's been very tame.

30:42.133 --> 30:43.667
- Yeah.
- Is that a boy or a

30:43.667 --> 30:44.667
girl?
Whoa!

30:44.667 --> 30:46.200
Hey!

30:46.200 --> 30:48.400
Both are boys.
Every one is boys.

30:48.400 --> 30:49.800
They have a return
policy?

30:49.800 --> 30:52.233
Um... not really.

30:52.233 --> 30:53.900
I don't blame you.
Let's cage this thing up and

30:53.900 --> 30:55.133
- take him.
- Perfect.

30:55.133 --> 30:57.333
There you go.
You have your rooster.

30:57.333 --> 31:00.300
Thank you.
Now I have the rooster, but it's

31:00.300 --> 31:02.367
not over.
I have to carry the rooster, I

31:02.367 --> 31:05.367
have to put my energy into him
or her.

31:05.367 --> 31:07.733
This whole rooster thing better
work.

31:07.733 --> 31:11.100
I'm sure people think it's a
little bit weird, but look at

31:11.100 --> 31:14.467
this family.
All right, you be good now.

31:14.467 --> 31:16.400
You hear?

31:16.400 --> 31:18.300
- All right, all right, all right.
- All right!

31:18.300 --> 31:20.833
No one's getting mad at you.
Calm down, you're in a Mercedes.

31:20.833 --> 31:31.300
Relax.

31:31.300 --> 31:33.100
There's Cakebread
Cellars.

31:33.100 --> 31:35.233
You have to take a picture of me
in front of the Cakebread

31:35.233 --> 31:37.767
- Cellars sign.
- 'Kay.

31:37.767 --> 31:39.367
- So cute.
- Yeah.

31:39.367 --> 31:41.133
- How's it going, ladies?
- Hi.

31:41.133 --> 31:42.633
- How we doing today?
- Good, how are you?

31:42.633 --> 31:44.000
Great, thank you.
Welcome in.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.400
- This is so amazing.
- I think we should

31:46.400 --> 31:47.833
take a picture with the
wineries.

31:47.833 --> 31:49.800
I don't want to take
one more picture.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.600
You're not into
snapping today?

31:51.600 --> 31:53.600
- No.
- Well, I'm gonna

31:53.600 --> 31:57.433
snap you're in a bad mood.
We have to fly back to L.A.

31:57.433 --> 32:00.900
soon, but we're hitting one last
winery on our way to the

32:00.900 --> 32:03.933
airport, but I can just really
tell something's bothering

32:03.933 --> 32:07.267
Khloe.
She's definitely not in as great

32:07.267 --> 32:09.167
of a mood today as she was
yesterday.

32:09.167 --> 32:10.567
I have a little area
where it's...

32:10.567 --> 32:11.600
- Great.
- ...private.

32:11.600 --> 32:12.833
- Awesome.
- You're gonna sit up

32:12.833 --> 32:14.867
- there, taste some wine.
- Super.

32:14.867 --> 32:17.933
It's very peaceful here.
Look at the clouds, you guys.

32:17.933 --> 32:21.833
- Just so beautiful.
- So you ladies feel free

32:21.833 --> 32:23.900
to grab a seat.
We should have some cheese in

32:23.900 --> 32:26.200
the center, which I'll kind of
go over here in a bit.

32:26.200 --> 32:32.500
Hello?

32:32.500 --> 32:36.667
Hey, Lam.
How are you?

32:36.667 --> 32:38.667
- I'm all right.
- Did you ice your knee?

32:38.667 --> 32:41.333
- Yeah.
- Um, did you eat today?

32:41.333 --> 32:43.500
I'm about to eat right
now, Pop Tarts.

32:43.500 --> 32:45.367
Pop Tarts are on your
diet?

32:45.367 --> 32:47.500
- Yeah.
- Okay.

32:47.500 --> 32:50.867
All right.
Bye.

32:50.867 --> 32:54.267
Um, what's

32:54.267 --> 32:56.600
happening?
Should we sit?

32:56.600 --> 33:00.400
God, it's so hard,
and, like, as it is, just me

33:00.400 --> 33:04.800
dealing with it.
I love Mom, and I know her

33:04.800 --> 33:07.700
intentions are super good, but
I feel so much pressure, and

33:07.700 --> 33:10.867
it's just, like, everything.
Like how we were yesterday, and

33:10.867 --> 33:13.267
she was like, "Oh, you and Lamar
should go to Craig's or go

33:13.267 --> 33:14.767
- here." It's like...
- Yeah.

33:14.767 --> 33:17.233
I just want to support
him and take care of him, but

33:17.233 --> 33:20.133
sometimes I get frustrated.
Like, why don't you want more

33:20.133 --> 33:22.033
for me, too?

33:24.367 --> 33:26.567
Where is he?

33:26.567 --> 33:28.000
I see him!

33:28.000 --> 33:30.267
You can't touch the
rooster because it can only have

33:30.267 --> 33:34.567
- my energy.
- Scott is so ridiculous.

33:34.567 --> 33:39.767
Don't you ever think
it's a cute surprise to have Lam

33:39.767 --> 33:41.667
come somewhere.
He doesn't understand it's like

33:41.667 --> 33:49.033
this snowball that starts, like,
rolling out of control.

33:49.033 --> 33:50.567
I just want to
support him and take care of

33:50.567 --> 33:53.100
him, but sometimes I get
frustrated.

33:53.100 --> 33:56.033
Like, why don't you want more
for me, too?

33:56.033 --> 33:57.300
- Yeah.
- Why is she so on

33:57.300 --> 33:59.200
his side and never really mine?

34:01.300 --> 34:04.867
I know my mom has good
intentions, but I just feel like

34:04.867 --> 34:08.033
she's not getting it.
I really just want my space for

34:08.033 --> 34:11.267
a minute from Lamar.
It's just a lot, and I feel

34:11.267 --> 34:13.933
like-- I love how much she loves
our people.

34:13.933 --> 34:16.033
- Yeah.
- And I also... I don't

34:16.033 --> 34:19.733
want that to change, but I just
want someone to just, like, care

34:19.733 --> 34:21.700
- about me a little, too.
- Maybe that's her

34:21.700 --> 34:23.500
- role.
- What?

34:23.500 --> 34:26.267
Just to be the one
to, like, push you.

34:26.267 --> 34:28.633
Maybe it's, like, a good
reminder that there's other

34:28.633 --> 34:32.200
options.
I think you should talk to Mom.

34:32.200 --> 34:33.867
Ugh.
I know Kourt is right and

34:33.867 --> 34:35.500
I definitely have to talk to my
mom.

34:35.500 --> 34:38.367
I also don't think that this
trip is appropriate for that

34:38.367 --> 34:41.967
talk, so I really want to enjoy
the rest of my trip, and I just

34:41.967 --> 34:44.300
will deal with this issue when I
get home.

34:44.300 --> 34:47.033
Divorce is the worst.
What do you want to do right

34:47.033 --> 34:48.400
- now?
- Um, I have to

34:48.400 --> 34:50.333
urinate.

34:50.333 --> 34:53.933
Oh, and we were sitting in

34:53.933 --> 34:56.467
- a spider web.
- Oh, my God-ula.

34:56.467 --> 34:59.333
Let's go!

34:59.333 --> 35:00.800
- Okay.
- Oh, we're-- you're

35:00.800 --> 35:08.500
waiting on us for once?
That's fresh.

35:08.500 --> 35:11.333
Hey, Tomer.

35:11.333 --> 35:12.667
Tomer, how's your
ginger?

35:12.667 --> 35:14.733
Tomer? Tomer!

35:14.733 --> 35:17.733
- How's your ginger penis, Tomer?
- Shut up.

35:17.733 --> 35:19.267
- Tomer!
- I'm sorry, I can't hear

35:19.267 --> 35:20.567
- you.
- I haven't seen you in

35:20.567 --> 35:21.900
- so long.
- Shut the  up.

35:21.900 --> 35:23.800
And your ginger
penis, Tomer.

35:23.800 --> 35:25.633
Stop it!
Sorry.

35:25.633 --> 35:28.300
Ginger Spice on the

35:28.300 --> 35:30.033
- ginger.
- Shut up!

35:30.033 --> 35:39.667
Sorry, what?

35:39.667 --> 35:41.900
- Kourt?
- Yeah?

35:41.900 --> 35:43.667
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:43.667 --> 35:46.433
- How was Napa?
- Mom was so fun.

35:46.433 --> 35:48.967
She got so drunk, but, like, it
was good.

35:48.967 --> 35:53.867
It was funny. She had a fun day.
So, Scott thinks he's cursed?

35:53.867 --> 35:57.433
I don't even believe in
that dumb thing, but yeah.

35:57.433 --> 36:00.900
- Yeah.
- So, Kendall calls me and

36:00.900 --> 36:04.433
tells me that Scott bought a
rooster to rid himself of the

36:04.433 --> 36:07.800
Kardashian curse.
Scott is so ridiculous.

36:07.800 --> 36:11.133
I mean, he does weird things
anyway, but this is, like, on

36:11.133 --> 36:13.667
another level.
He just, like, is reaching.

36:13.667 --> 36:16.267
I'm so annoyed he'd even think
that exists.

36:16.267 --> 36:18.633
- Like, there's no such thing.
- Obviously.

36:18.633 --> 36:20.767
Of course, put the blame
somewhere else, you know?

36:20.767 --> 36:23.133
- Always.
- He never wants to take,

36:23.133 --> 36:25.533
like, accountability for his own
actions.

36:25.533 --> 36:28.533
He wants to always put the blame
on someone else.

36:28.533 --> 36:31.500
Yeah.

36:31.500 --> 36:33.300
- Kourt?
- Yeah?

36:33.300 --> 36:34.667
What are you guys
doing?

36:34.667 --> 36:36.467
- Hi.
- Hi.

36:36.467 --> 36:38.667
- Benny June.
- Benny June?

36:38.667 --> 36:40.900
- Are you Armenian?
- No.

36:40.900 --> 36:42.500
- Oh.
- He looks Armenian

36:42.500 --> 36:44.233
- though.
- Yeah, totally.

36:44.233 --> 36:46.233
- Hello!
- Who's home?

36:46.233 --> 36:47.600
Who's that?
Northie?

36:47.600 --> 36:49.300
Hello, Northie?

36:49.300 --> 36:51.533
- Oh, no, Reign. Hi.
- Oh, is it Reign?

36:51.533 --> 36:53.067
- Where's Mase?
- He's here.

36:53.067 --> 36:56.600
- Hi, my little chunk.
- Hi, Reignie.

36:56.600 --> 36:59.267
- Wait, what's going on?
- What do you mean?

36:59.267 --> 37:06.300
You think that we cursed
you?

37:06.300 --> 37:08.567
Did you really go to a voodoo
doctor?

37:08.567 --> 37:12.400
I-I've been shopping
around, yeah.

37:12.400 --> 37:15.867
I just think a lot of people
have come into this family and

37:15.867 --> 37:19.000
- hasn't been the easiest.
- It's such a lie.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.033
You guys think nothing
is ever wrong.

37:21.033 --> 37:23.033
- A Kardashian curse?
- It's not real.

37:23.033 --> 37:34.133
- Are you joking?
- I'm offended.

37:34.133 --> 37:36.133
- A Kardashian curse?
- It's not real.

37:36.133 --> 37:42.100
- Are you joking?
- I'm offended.

37:42.100 --> 37:44.700
It just seems like
the guys in the family have it a

37:44.700 --> 37:46.967
- little tougher.
- They definitely do.

37:46.967 --> 37:48.767
- I will say that.
- Right, it's tough.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.933
But you blame your
actions on something else,

37:50.933 --> 37:54.200
somebody else.
It's never just because...

37:54.200 --> 37:56.233
- What do you mean?
- You always think,

37:56.233 --> 37:59.767
"Oh, I was born into this."
"It's because of that."

37:59.767 --> 38:07.033
Like, you just always have an
excuse for everything.

38:07.033 --> 38:09.667
You know, I may have
gotten a little caught up with

38:09.667 --> 38:13.433
this whole curse thing, and
maybe taken it a little too far.

38:13.433 --> 38:15.867
All right, so maybe there's not
a curse.

38:15.867 --> 38:20.567
Maybe I should stop with the
excuses.

38:20.567 --> 38:23.067
Wait, so do you really
have a rooster?

38:23.067 --> 38:25.267
Do you have a
Kourtney voodoo doll is what I

38:25.267 --> 38:28.333
- want to know.
No, it-it's life-size

38:28.333 --> 38:30.433
so I can bang it.

38:30.433 --> 38:32.533
- Where is this rooster?
- It's around.

38:32.533 --> 38:34.600
- Don't worry about it.
- We're gonna find

38:34.600 --> 38:36.033
- it.
- Reign, do you want to

38:36.033 --> 38:37.967
- see a rooster?
- Where's Mase?

38:37.967 --> 38:40.200
He's here.

38:40.200 --> 38:43.767
- Mase!
- Where is he?

38:43.767 --> 38:46.867
There he is! I see him!

38:46.867 --> 38:49.200
I see him!

38:49.200 --> 38:51.833
- I see him!
Uh-oh.

38:51.833 --> 38:54.133
There it is.
Oh, by the way, you can't touch

38:54.133 --> 38:57.533
the rooster, because he can only
have my energy.

38:57.533 --> 38:59.867
Who knows?
If I tell Kourtney the rooster

38:59.867 --> 39:02.500
is, like, gluten free and
organic free...

39:02.500 --> 39:04.667
- So weird.
- ...she may keep the

39:04.667 --> 39:07.467
thing. I don't know.
I feel like I weirded you guys

39:07.467 --> 39:10.933
- out with the rooster.
- You think?

39:10.933 --> 39:13.967
To think, like, Kanye and I are
the most normal ones out of this

39:13.967 --> 39:15.900
- family is...
- You're actually

39:15.900 --> 39:17.400
- not.
- Yeah, we are.

39:17.400 --> 39:19.733
I don't know how
you define normal, but...

39:29.000 --> 39:33.167
It's always hot.
I need powder on this mug.

39:33.167 --> 39:35.900
You know, I'm obsessed
with books right now?

39:35.900 --> 39:41.067
I'm reading a book about Le
Corbusier, which is an

39:41.067 --> 39:43.833
architect.
It's so weird and boring.

39:43.833 --> 39:46.267
- But I'm obsessed.
- No, you're not, and

39:46.267 --> 39:48.767
- you're not reading that book.
- Well, I look at them.

39:48.767 --> 39:51.400
Right, you look at it.
It's not a real book.

39:51.400 --> 39:54.000
It has words.
Big words.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.800
Oh, this building was
erected in 19-whatever?

39:56.800 --> 39:59.067
Yeah, it's his...
called history.

39:59.067 --> 40:03.200
That's a coffee table
book.

40:03.200 --> 40:06.800
Um, okay, so why I wanted to
talk to you is...

40:06.800 --> 40:09.833
- Oh, my God.
- No, but, like, even

40:09.833 --> 40:13.533
this weekend, like, you just do
things.

40:13.533 --> 40:18.000
So, I love Lamar with all of my
heart, and I love, love, love,

40:18.000 --> 40:20.600
love him, and I want the best
for him.

40:20.600 --> 40:25.733
But don't you ever think it's a
cute surprise to have Lam come

40:25.733 --> 40:28.833
somewhere.
Okay, you guys don't understand.

40:28.833 --> 40:31.600
It's like this snowball that
starts, like, rolling out of

40:31.600 --> 40:35.100
- control. I...
- I understand that.

40:35.100 --> 40:37.333
Okay, but I'm not
done.

40:37.333 --> 40:39.800
- Okay.
- Like, sometimes I feel

40:39.800 --> 40:42.933
like, as my mom, you should want
a little bit better for me.

40:42.933 --> 40:47.167
I'm tired of feeling trapped.
When I originally needed to file

40:47.167 --> 40:49.933
for divorce, it was the hardest
thing in my life.

40:49.933 --> 40:53.133
- I never wanted a divorce ever.
- Yeah, I know.

40:53.133 --> 40:56.867
And so I finally had
the strength to do that, and

40:56.867 --> 41:00.200
now, I only took divorce off the
table to help him.

41:00.200 --> 41:02.200
- I understand.
- But now I feel, but

41:02.200 --> 41:04.967
now I feel back, like I'm, like
it's the hardest thing again.

41:04.967 --> 41:08.667
But I'm like, I...
I don't look at Lamar in a

41:08.667 --> 41:11.700
romantic way.
I want to have kids one day.

41:11.700 --> 41:14.267
I might want to get remarried
one day.

41:14.267 --> 41:19.300
So I'm just gonna sit in this
weird space, like...

41:19.300 --> 41:21.567
- What?
- I think Lamar needs us

41:21.567 --> 41:23.667
- as a family.
- Totally.

41:23.667 --> 41:25.367
But Lamar and I are not
together.

41:25.367 --> 41:27.933
That's what I'm trying to tell
you.

41:27.933 --> 41:41.100
So I need to move on, and I will
be filing for divorce very soon.

41:41.100 --> 41:43.100
Lamar and I are not
together.

41:43.100 --> 41:45.133
That's what I'm trying to tell
you.

41:45.133 --> 41:53.933
So I need to move on, and I will
be filing for divorce very soon.

41:53.933 --> 41:56.367
I've been very honest with
Lamar.

41:56.367 --> 41:59.333
I will still be his medical
advisor, and I'll be the advisor

41:59.333 --> 42:01.833
to all of his finances if he
ever becomes incapacitated

42:01.833 --> 42:04.433
again.
I want you guys to remain

42:04.433 --> 42:07.000
friends with him.
I want you guys to love him and

42:07.000 --> 42:09.267
talk to him every day.
There's no reason not to.

42:09.267 --> 42:11.300
- I have forgiven Lamar.
- Yeah.

42:11.300 --> 42:14.167
But I still have
boundaries.

42:14.167 --> 42:17.100
I've been focusing on Lamar for
so long, but it's time that I

42:17.100 --> 42:19.467
focus on me.
This marriage just needs to end,

42:19.467 --> 42:21.600
and let's just see what happens
after that.

42:21.600 --> 42:24.067
One day at a time.
My point is I want him to know

42:24.067 --> 42:26.867
he still has a family.
He can still come to family

42:26.867 --> 42:30.167
dinners, if I invite him or if
you're like, "Hey, do you want

42:30.167 --> 42:33.333
Lamar to come?"
You could ask me.

42:33.333 --> 42:36.833
Yeah.
Sometimes I forget what you've

42:36.833 --> 42:40.200
gone through.
You come first, and I'm here for

42:40.200 --> 42:43.300
you, and you are going to have
to tell me what my boundaries

42:43.300 --> 42:46.567
are.
I understand it when you say it

42:46.567 --> 42:49.900
like that.
I get it.

42:49.900 --> 42:54.767
I understand.
I will be and try better.

42:54.767 --> 42:57.333
I love you.
Give me a hug.

42:57.333 --> 43:00.633
I love you so much. All right?
I get what you're saying.

43:00.633 --> 43:02.867
I'm trying.
I'm gonna be a better mom.

43:02.867 --> 43:04.867
- You're a great mom.
- And I'm gonna be more

43:04.867 --> 43:07.167
understanding and more
respectful of your boundaries.

43:07.167 --> 43:10.300
- How about that?
- We'll see how long

43:10.300 --> 43:12.367
- this will last for.
- Okay.

43:12.367 --> 43:18.100
Live in the moment.
Nice chatting with you.

43:18.100 --> 43:23.100
- Coming up next week...
- Welcome to Vail, kids!

43:23.100 --> 43:25.867
- Oh, my!
- My dad used to take us

43:25.867 --> 43:28.233
- to Vail every year.
- It's so crazy that

43:28.233 --> 43:30.200
- we're back here.
- Thank you, Mom, for

43:30.200 --> 43:31.900
- putting this all together.
- I love you guys.

43:31.900 --> 43:33.233
- Love you.
- You think I'm, like,

43:33.233 --> 43:35.433
the bad guy all the time.
He still has to make a decision

43:35.433 --> 43:37.567
- as a man.
- Hi, Bob!

43:37.567 --> 43:40.133
- I miss you.
- No! He proposed in

43:40.133 --> 43:42.467
front of her whole family?
