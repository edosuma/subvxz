13:37.633 --> 13:40.631
I respect you. I respect your place.

13:40.656 --> 13:44.094
But you hold your stress in too
long, it rots out your insides.

13:44.119 --> 13:48.921
So I am gonna get my payback
on that red dot motherfucker.

13:48.946 --> 13:50.879
He can't stay in here forever.

14:04.847 --> 14:09.365
What if you stayed in here forever?

14:10.600 --> 14:12.602
What if...

14:12.627 --> 14:13.894
you...

14:14.202 --> 14:16.772
never left this room?

14:23.211 --> 14:24.813
Get the fuck outta here.

14:26.882 --> 14:30.111
Some fuckhead busts your headlight
don't mean you get to bust his face.

14:30.136 --> 14:32.654
Good news is the guy's an old scumbag.

14:32.721 --> 14:34.513
Thing is, we don't know yet what kind

14:34.538 --> 14:37.015
of cell phone video we
might be dealing with.

14:37.593 --> 14:40.834
So I want you to listen
to your good friend, Bo.

14:42.095 --> 14:45.693
You sustained multiple blows to the
head during the altercation. Okay?

14:45.718 --> 14:47.940
Your PBA rep advises you

14:47.965 --> 14:49.705
not to make any statements
till we can confirm

14:49.771 --> 14:52.119
your cognitive functions
were operating normally.

14:52.144 --> 14:54.446
I understand you suffered
a blow to the head as well.

14:54.512 --> 14:56.882
He tried to pull me off. I
caught him with the backswing.

14:56.949 --> 14:58.545
It doesn't make a
difference who hit him.

14:58.570 --> 15:00.538
All that matters is
he can't be interviewed

15:00.563 --> 15:02.998
until we're sure he's compos mentis.

15:03.422 --> 15:05.571
No, look, I don't need a tow.

15:05.596 --> 15:08.026
There is no way you're getting
behind the wheel of that car.

15:08.092 --> 15:09.961
Gives someone an excuse
to give you breathalyzer.

15:10.028 --> 15:12.664
I can change the tire, take
the car home. It's okay.

15:12.731 --> 15:14.183
Not only is no one changing that tire,

15:14.208 --> 15:17.702
No one's wiping a smudge off the
bumper of that precious automobile

15:17.769 --> 15:20.255
until all the damage has
been fully documented.

15:20.280 --> 15:21.839
Keys.

15:31.616 --> 15:33.818
Time to go.

15:33.885 --> 15:36.128
Come on. Kids'll be up soon.

15:36.153 --> 15:37.468
I don't want them to be confused.

15:37.493 --> 15:40.124
I don't want them to
be confused, either.

15:40.191 --> 15:42.827
So you wouldn't want them
to wake up and find you here

15:42.894 --> 15:46.230
when they know you
don't live here anymore.

15:46.297 --> 15:48.466
And what if I did?

15:48.467 --> 15:50.535
What if you did what?

15:50.602 --> 15:54.012
Live here still... again.

15:54.037 --> 15:57.163
Are you fucking kidding me?

15:57.909 --> 16:01.590
[stammering] I assume last
night indicated a softening

16:01.615 --> 16:04.290
- about your feeling toward...
- Last night indicated

16:04.315 --> 16:06.742
you came over after I put the
kids to bed and got me drunk.

16:06.767 --> 16:08.015
Well, I got us both drunk.

16:08.040 --> 16:10.970
One night, giving in to
your debatable charm...

16:10.995 --> 16:13.892
Hey. He called me.

16:13.982 --> 16:15.680
A decision of which I grow prouder

16:15.713 --> 16:16.719
- with each passing moment.
- [phone chimes]

16:16.744 --> 16:18.054
Hold that thought.

16:24.335 --> 16:25.937
[siren in distance]

16:31.643 --> 16:33.377
What the fuck am I gonna tell Grandpa?

16:33.512 --> 16:35.447
Or Grandma? Fuck!

16:37.048 --> 16:38.817
Why do you have to tell them anything

16:38.883 --> 16:41.085
that they don't know, right?

16:41.152 --> 16:42.554
You don't think they're gonna find out?

16:42.621 --> 16:45.032
First question they're gonna ask
when you walk through the door is,

16:45.057 --> 16:47.215
"Where the fuck you been all night?"

16:50.028 --> 16:53.532
Okay, okay, okay. Listen.

16:53.565 --> 16:55.363
We got shitfaced, right?

16:55.388 --> 16:57.602
We decided to crash at my place,

16:57.669 --> 16:59.428
and we wake up with these, like...

16:59.453 --> 17:01.788
these Dean Martin hangovers.

17:02.040 --> 17:04.075
They're expecting you at
the office today, right?

17:04.142 --> 17:07.211
Uh, yeah. It's Julia's day off. Yeah.

17:07.278 --> 17:08.780
You take a taxi.

17:08.847 --> 17:11.381
There's a stand across the street.

17:11.481 --> 17:13.550
You just tell them that
I'm... I don't know...

17:14.143 --> 17:17.355
I'm sleeping it off. Okay?

17:17.421 --> 17:18.836
Okay.

17:20.344 --> 17:23.002
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no. I know
you said it was the last time.

17:23.027 --> 17:26.598
I remember. But look,
there's money in it for you.

17:27.065 --> 17:28.767
I don't know, at least ten grand.

17:28.833 --> 17:30.082
Can I do the...

17:30.107 --> 17:32.060
Hey. Yeah.

17:32.103 --> 17:35.607
[sizzling]

17:35.674 --> 17:37.288
Good morning.

17:37.313 --> 17:39.310
- Hey.
- Mommy, guess what.

17:39.377 --> 17:41.179
Daddy Lance missed us so much,

17:41.245 --> 17:44.398
he even made us pancakes
on his way to work.

17:44.423 --> 17:46.104
Isn't that nice of him?

17:46.129 --> 17:49.721
I said I came to see you.

17:49.953 --> 17:52.891
The pancakes were Fenna's idea.

17:52.957 --> 17:55.426
- Mmm.
- Want some, Mom?

17:55.493 --> 17:57.428
How can I say no?

17:57.495 --> 17:59.263
You can't.

17:59.330 --> 18:00.632
You shouldn't.

18:01.178 --> 18:04.703
- I helped with the bananas.
- You did?

18:04.769 --> 18:08.239
- [strains]
- Also I helped with cracking the eggs.

18:08.306 --> 18:09.662
Wow.

18:31.696 --> 18:33.698
Jeez! Where's the fire?

18:33.765 --> 18:35.533
Oh, I'm sorry. I got cab waiting for me.

18:35.634 --> 18:36.835
Yeah, I saw.

18:36.901 --> 18:38.703
Guess you had a hell
of a night last night.

18:38.770 --> 18:41.205
- Boys back together...
- I gotta go. I'm sorry...

18:41.272 --> 18:43.842
- Why did you ever leave this place?
- I didn't leave.

18:43.908 --> 18:45.944
- My mom took me away.
- Yeah, but why?

18:46.010 --> 18:48.300
Always seemed like all of
you guys were so happy here,

18:48.325 --> 18:49.705
all of you together.

18:49.748 --> 18:52.116
- I don't know. She didn't tell me.
- You never asked?

18:52.183 --> 18:54.599
I just got the feeling that she didn't
really wanna talk about it, okay?

18:54.624 --> 18:56.933
- I'm sorry, I...
- That thing that you did last night.

18:56.958 --> 18:59.251
Picking my pocket.
Think you could teach me?

18:59.276 --> 19:02.666
I was teaching you...
not to fuck with my stuff.

19:08.833 --> 19:11.221
Couldn't you just say it's a fake?

19:12.136 --> 19:14.673
When he asks why a grown
man's carrying a fake I.D.,

19:14.739 --> 19:16.845
what do I say, I'm a secret agent?

19:16.870 --> 19:18.677
He's a police officer.

19:18.710 --> 19:20.416
He's a psychopath.

19:20.441 --> 19:23.081
Maybe you used one in
your insurance work.

19:23.693 --> 19:25.717
- That's actually not bad.
- Thank you.

19:25.784 --> 19:29.053
But when he runs the name Marius
Josepovich through the database...

19:29.159 --> 19:30.511
Yeah, you're right. You're fucked.

19:30.536 --> 19:32.250
[sighs]

19:32.275 --> 19:34.082
But that's not your problem.

19:34.125 --> 19:35.503
Your problem is that you didn't tell me

19:35.528 --> 19:38.296
that covering for you with Mr. Success

19:38.362 --> 19:40.965
was putting my family
in the crosshairs of some

19:41.032 --> 19:44.869
ex-cop gangster and
some still-cop psycho

19:44.936 --> 19:47.238
looking to pay you
back for taking his eye.

19:47.305 --> 19:49.107
He didn't lose the eye.

19:52.911 --> 19:55.880
They are gonna get to
me sooner or later, okay?

19:55.947 --> 19:59.483
Now, you know, no matter
how pissed off I am at you,

19:59.550 --> 20:01.187
and I fucking am,

20:01.212 --> 20:03.754
that I would never
wanna see you get hurt...

20:03.822 --> 20:06.090
Katie, no. If they show up,

20:06.157 --> 20:08.126
you tell them everything you know

20:08.192 --> 20:10.301
about how to find me, you understand?

20:10.626 --> 20:13.932
Vince is a dangerous
man, but he's not crazy.

20:13.998 --> 20:15.362
As long as you don't get in his way,

20:15.387 --> 20:17.743
he's got no reason to
hurt you or your family.

20:23.107 --> 20:26.440
I hope you get in the safe.
You are guaranteeing me ten,

20:26.670 --> 20:28.662
even if it's like Al Capone's vault.

20:28.702 --> 20:31.115
If it's empty, how am
I gonna get you $10,000?

20:31.182 --> 20:33.584
The next safe. I'm serious.

20:33.651 --> 20:35.798
Guarantee me ten, or I am on
my way back to White Plains.

20:35.823 --> 20:39.139
Do you not find it odd that you're
asking a convicted confidence man

20:39.164 --> 20:40.387
to give you his word of honor?

20:40.412 --> 20:42.594
No, your conviction
was for bank robbery.

20:43.202 --> 20:45.003
Promise me.

20:46.152 --> 20:47.721
All right.

20:51.139 --> 20:52.541
So...

20:52.566 --> 20:55.081
I wait for Grandma to go
out on her daily rounds.

20:55.106 --> 20:58.009
I walk in. I ask
Grandpa for a bond for...

20:58.076 --> 21:00.789
- For Preston James Collins III.
- And he is?

21:00.814 --> 21:02.913
The top name on
yesterday's arrest blotter.

21:02.981 --> 21:05.183
Okay. I ask Grandpa
for a bond for Preston.

21:05.249 --> 21:07.791
My collateral is this bullshit,

21:07.816 --> 21:10.430
whose value you confirmed based
on your insurance knowledge.

21:10.455 --> 21:13.691
The thing is, this is a
treasured family heirloom.

21:13.792 --> 21:16.594
Lots of sentimental value. If
I'm gonna let it out of my sight,

21:16.660 --> 21:19.013
I need to actually see
it get locked in the safe.

21:19.038 --> 21:21.465
- Right.
- You think that'll, uh...

21:21.532 --> 21:24.975
play better if I remove the
tag that says it costs $15?

21:25.000 --> 21:27.205
Look, cut me some slack here, all right?

21:27.271 --> 21:30.518
- Jesus Christ.
- Okay. Say he buys all that,

21:30.543 --> 21:32.811
opens the safe to put my precious in,

21:32.836 --> 21:35.321
how the fuck are we supposed to empty
it with him standing right there?

21:35.346 --> 21:38.116
We don't need to empty it. We just
need to switch out the cash box.

21:38.182 --> 21:39.876
But even if he doesn't see you take it,

21:39.901 --> 21:41.156
how is he not gonna see that it's gone?

21:41.181 --> 21:43.287
Because I'm gonna switch it out. Look.

21:43.354 --> 21:45.039
He won't notice the difference?

21:45.064 --> 21:47.113
- No. He's gonna be too distracted.
- By?

21:47.138 --> 21:48.371
By the woman having a
seizure on the floor.

21:48.396 --> 21:49.899
Shit!

21:50.094 --> 21:53.331
This was always your bread
and butter, all right?

22:11.082 --> 22:13.384
Frank Winslow, Manhattan North,

22:13.863 --> 22:16.566
Narcotics and Vice Enforcement.

22:18.216 --> 22:20.085
How exactly can I help you?

22:20.110 --> 22:22.015
Marius Josepovich?

22:22.326 --> 22:24.781
You're gonna have to be
more specific than that.

22:24.806 --> 22:27.731
His name's come up in an investigation.

22:27.866 --> 22:31.176
- Narcotics or vice?
- Oh, don't worry, he's not a suspect.

22:31.201 --> 22:33.971
He's just a former known associate
of some of the key people.

22:33.996 --> 22:37.075
Detective, if one of my
parolees is connected to a crime,

22:37.141 --> 22:38.876
- procedure dictates...
- No, no, no.

22:38.877 --> 22:41.012
I wouldn't say he's connected to it.

22:41.079 --> 22:43.047
Then what would you say?

22:45.716 --> 22:48.652
I think you and I got off
on the wrong foot here.

22:48.719 --> 22:51.572
I am gonna go ahead and call
my own number on that one.

22:51.597 --> 22:54.725
I got sent to a department
mandated shrink for a while,

22:54.792 --> 22:57.528
said I broadcast hostility.

23:00.752 --> 23:02.682
I hear you were a Marine.

23:02.958 --> 23:04.280
Nope.

23:04.305 --> 23:06.152
Sorry?

23:06.216 --> 23:10.641
Oh, yeah. No such thing
as a former Marine. Yeah.

23:10.708 --> 23:14.003
Seems like half the guys
in my squad are jarheads.

23:14.028 --> 23:16.592
They join up as soon as
they left active duty.

23:16.617 --> 23:19.347
You ever consider going that route?

23:19.372 --> 23:20.918
Thought about it.

23:20.919 --> 23:25.216
Even did a full semester towards an
associate degree in criminal justice

23:25.241 --> 23:27.043
at Duchess Community.

23:27.425 --> 23:30.361
Turns out social work was more my speed.

23:30.732 --> 23:33.264
The important thing is
we're on the same side.

23:33.331 --> 23:35.566
Oh, yeah? And what side is that?

23:37.735 --> 23:38.802
Law enforcement?

23:38.937 --> 23:41.243
[laughing]

23:41.878 --> 23:44.430
No, that's where I'm gonna
have to disagree with you.

23:44.455 --> 23:45.944
How's that?

23:46.010 --> 23:48.046
I know not here to enforce, brother.

23:48.112 --> 23:50.014
I'm here to empower.

23:50.081 --> 23:53.551
You are gonna empower
these shit-stain ex-cons

23:53.617 --> 23:55.153
to do what exactly?

23:55.219 --> 23:57.355
To be their best selves.

24:00.224 --> 24:02.318
All I need is an address
where he's staying.

24:02.343 --> 24:03.735
I'll tell you what, Detective.

24:03.760 --> 24:05.463
You have questions for Mr. Josepovich?

24:05.529 --> 24:07.999
Write them down, I'll
make sure he gets them.

24:08.066 --> 24:11.269
Anything other than that,
come back with a warrant.

24:11.335 --> 24:14.305
You gotta be fucking kidding.

24:14.372 --> 24:16.133
You meditate?

24:16.251 --> 24:17.585
No.

24:17.610 --> 24:19.012
That's a shame.

24:38.162 --> 24:41.632
Otto: Your friend is charged with
driving his car over his cousin.

24:41.699 --> 24:45.403
Hope you don't mind me asking,
but just out of curiosity,

24:45.469 --> 24:48.760
how'd you two meet, you and Mr. Collins?

24:48.785 --> 24:53.411
I was working at a gentlemen's
club down in Orlando...

24:53.485 --> 24:55.721
as a waitress, thank you very much.

24:55.779 --> 24:56.890
Anyway, Press was security,

24:56.915 --> 24:58.782
made sure nobody touched the
girls, that kind of thing.

24:58.849 --> 25:01.485
He was the only boy there
I could ever talk to.

25:29.429 --> 25:31.512
I'm sorry about this. I just...

25:31.537 --> 25:33.806
after the stroke, sometimes...

25:34.234 --> 25:37.667
it just feels like my fingers
belong to someone else.

25:40.591 --> 25:43.004
- I won't take it. My business...
- Give us a half hour.

25:43.029 --> 25:45.364
This is ridiculous. I... I have...

38:27.124 --> 38:28.658
So we go screaming up

38:28.725 --> 38:31.528
just as the perp comes
jamming out of the store.

38:31.594 --> 38:35.430
Right? Before we can even
roll to a stop... Boom!

38:35.923 --> 38:37.691
He fires off a shot at us.

38:38.083 --> 38:40.315
What the fuck? You know?

38:40.340 --> 38:43.140
Just one. I mean, it didn't
come anywhere near us.

38:43.206 --> 38:45.876
I don't think he intended to, but still.

38:45.943 --> 38:48.912
Anyway, he takes one look at Lonnie

38:48.979 --> 38:50.948
and practically shits himself.

38:51.014 --> 38:53.550
I mean, he tosses away the gun

38:53.616 --> 38:55.385
like it was on fire.

38:58.287 --> 39:01.156
Turns out this perp was just a kid.

39:01.391 --> 39:03.894
And we caught him a couple times

39:03.961 --> 39:06.864
being the lookout on a crack corner.

39:06.897 --> 39:09.332
And we'd slap him around,

39:09.399 --> 39:11.401
and we'd let him go with a warning.

39:11.468 --> 39:14.972
"Don't you ever fuckin' let us
catch you on this block again."

39:15.038 --> 39:17.507
You know, that kind of shit. [chuckles]

39:19.576 --> 39:21.444
This was different.

39:21.914 --> 39:25.800
Now, this kid... Terrence was his name.

39:25.825 --> 39:28.260
Couldn't be more than 17 years old.

39:28.285 --> 39:30.996
The kind of kid who would smile

39:31.021 --> 39:33.358
when he got nervous, you know?

39:34.025 --> 39:37.894
Even when you're smacking
him around, he'd smile.

39:37.895 --> 39:40.230
It's the damndest thing.

39:40.255 --> 39:44.045
And he'd look up at you with
these big, brown Bambi eyes.

39:44.070 --> 39:47.270
Oh, boy.

39:48.906 --> 39:51.074
Anyway, instead of going to the house

39:51.141 --> 39:53.476
and booking the kid, Lonnie has me drive

39:53.543 --> 39:58.048
to one of those Grandmaster
Flash ghost town streets,

39:58.115 --> 40:01.684
you know, with the busted-out windows
with the cardboard all over it,

40:01.751 --> 40:04.621
newspapers blowing
around like tumbleweeds,

40:04.687 --> 40:07.592
the stench of piss and pot.

40:08.291 --> 40:10.860
So Lonnie grabs the kid
out of the back of the car,

40:10.928 --> 40:12.464
puts him down on the ground face-up,

40:12.489 --> 40:14.725
pulls out his arm, right,

40:14.750 --> 40:17.202
between two cinder blocks,

40:17.299 --> 40:20.277
and he tells me, "Jump on it.

40:20.302 --> 40:22.672
"Both feet, hard as you can.

40:22.697 --> 40:24.432
Aim for the back of the elbow."

40:24.457 --> 40:26.759
Bam! Right?

40:27.078 --> 40:29.612
Now, you break an elbow like that,

40:29.679 --> 40:33.044
and it's just never gonna heal right.

40:33.157 --> 40:36.638
You could even rupture
the artery, right,

40:36.663 --> 40:38.455
and the kid would lose his arm.

40:38.521 --> 40:42.643
Now, Terrence knows
this, and he's scared,

40:42.668 --> 40:46.363
smilin' and lookin' at me
with those big, sad eyes.

40:46.429 --> 40:50.067
And I know this, right?
So I pull Lonnie aside,

40:50.133 --> 40:52.102
and I whisper in his ear,

40:52.405 --> 40:55.905
"Lonnie, he's a kid, okay?

40:55.973 --> 40:58.241
"He made a mistake, all right?

40:58.308 --> 40:59.976
"I think he's scared enough."

41:00.001 --> 41:02.207
And so on and so forth.

41:02.587 --> 41:06.216
Lonnie turns to me and whispers back,

41:06.283 --> 41:09.253
"You want to teach this kid a lesson?

41:09.278 --> 41:12.118
"You want to do him a favor?

41:12.522 --> 41:15.292
Give him something to remember us by."

41:17.294 --> 41:20.830
Well, I... I... you know...

41:20.897 --> 41:23.000
Quickly, Lonnie learns that I...

41:23.033 --> 41:24.294
I just... I'm not gonna do this.

41:24.319 --> 41:26.488
He can't talk me into it.

41:27.004 --> 41:29.472
Without a word, picks up the kid,

41:29.539 --> 41:31.574
puts him back in the back of the car,

41:31.641 --> 41:33.910
off we go to the house for the booking,

41:34.011 --> 41:36.279
end of story, right?

41:37.284 --> 41:40.087
Seven, eight years later,

41:40.750 --> 41:43.019
I hear about this detective

41:43.020 --> 41:45.400
who gets blasted at a drug rip

41:45.425 --> 41:48.344
in one of the Brownsville
projects, right?

41:48.871 --> 41:51.173
Shooter's in the wind.

41:51.494 --> 41:55.165
Now, any time a cop gets killed,
it's gonna move the needle.

41:55.232 --> 41:58.268
But we were losing guys
every few weeks back then,

41:58.335 --> 42:01.218
so I didn't really
pay much mind to it...

42:02.439 --> 42:04.674
until I heard the shooter's name.

42:07.550 --> 42:10.233
The next morning,

42:10.750 --> 42:12.339
I answer my door.

42:12.382 --> 42:15.085
Who's there? Lonnie.

42:15.583 --> 42:17.820
And so I'm thinking, "Okay, okay.

42:17.887 --> 42:20.290
"I know, I know. We're
going over to Queens.

42:20.357 --> 42:22.592
"We're going to the dead cop's wake,

42:22.659 --> 42:23.960
"pay our respects."

42:23.985 --> 42:26.020
He's right. It's the least I can do.

42:26.045 --> 42:28.580
Okay. I get it.

42:28.765 --> 42:30.900
Instead of going over
to Queens, though...

42:32.245 --> 42:33.767
Jersey.

42:34.505 --> 42:38.281
He gets on the turnpike
and gets off in Secaucus.

42:38.432 --> 42:41.077
Now, at first I'm relieved,

42:41.078 --> 42:42.779
because, you know,

42:42.845 --> 42:46.716
I didn't really wanna
face this grieving widow

42:46.783 --> 42:49.319
and all the weepy kids

42:49.386 --> 42:51.210
with their snot on their ties

42:51.235 --> 42:53.304
and all that shit, so...

42:53.478 --> 42:56.869
But then Lonnie turns off the road,

42:57.394 --> 43:00.442
and he starts heading
towards the Meadowlands.

43:00.467 --> 43:01.950
Now...

43:03.118 --> 43:06.336
I'm not... I'm not
scared exactly, not yet.

43:07.891 --> 43:11.594
But I know how many bodies
are buried out there.

43:12.109 --> 43:14.677
But I'm thinking, "I mean, come on,

43:14.744 --> 43:18.215
"there's no way that
Lonnie is gonna clip me,

43:18.281 --> 43:20.850
"no matter how pissed he is,

43:20.917 --> 43:25.622
"just because I gave a
little kid some compassion.

43:25.688 --> 43:27.375
"No way."

43:28.525 --> 43:30.660
But he turns off the road,

43:30.727 --> 43:35.332
gets out, and he leads me
into some weeds, all right?

43:35.398 --> 43:37.709
Now, these weeds are taller

43:37.734 --> 43:40.303
than the both of us
in some spots, right?

43:40.370 --> 43:42.639
So we're working our
way through the weeds,

43:42.705 --> 43:47.278
and out of nowhere, it opens up,

43:47.303 --> 43:50.460
and there we are in
this little clearing.

43:50.485 --> 43:53.441
And that's when I see them.
There's, like, 12 guys.

43:53.466 --> 43:54.982
Now, there's no uniforms,

43:55.007 --> 43:58.688
but you could tell,
they're all on the job,

43:58.755 --> 44:02.525
and they all got shovels and quicklime,

44:02.592 --> 44:05.719
and they're standing
around a big rectangle hole

44:05.744 --> 44:07.746
that they just finished digging.

44:11.513 --> 44:15.804
I'm freaking out a little bit.

44:16.547 --> 44:19.483
And then I... I crane my neck and I see.

44:20.280 --> 44:24.614
Right at the edge of the
hole is a man kneeling.

44:27.817 --> 44:31.588
I don't know how long
they were beating on him,

44:31.654 --> 44:36.259
but his head was so
swollen, it hurt to look at.

44:36.735 --> 44:39.262
And I could still see him

44:39.329 --> 44:41.631
looking up at me with his sad eyes.

44:41.698 --> 44:44.367
Only now, it's just
through a little slit,

44:44.434 --> 44:46.269
'cause it's so swollen.

44:46.336 --> 44:49.206
And he still had that nervous smile.

44:51.136 --> 44:53.171
Only now, I couldn't
see any of his teeth

44:53.196 --> 44:55.131
on account of all the blood.

44:59.048 --> 45:02.037
And I could feel those
cops looking at me...

45:03.286 --> 45:06.289
boring a hole into my head.

45:07.674 --> 45:10.410
I don't know what the
fuck Lonnie told them,

45:10.435 --> 45:13.229
but Lonnie...

45:13.230 --> 45:15.365
squeezes a burner...

45:15.432 --> 45:17.500
into my hand.

45:17.567 --> 45:20.637
And I look at this thing, and
there's no tape on the grip.

45:20.703 --> 45:21.772
Why?

45:21.797 --> 45:23.229
'Cause as soon as it's over,

45:23.301 --> 45:26.547
this is gonna go in the
hole with that motherfucker.

45:27.810 --> 45:31.760
And the quicklime will
wipe out any of the prints.

45:31.785 --> 45:33.594
So...

45:34.351 --> 45:37.454
anyway, he puts that gun in my hand.

45:37.748 --> 45:40.069
He takes a look at
Terrence on his knees,

45:40.094 --> 45:41.662
shaking with fear,

45:41.958 --> 45:45.046
swollen face looking up at us,

45:45.071 --> 45:47.806
hoping he's not gonna be killed.

45:47.831 --> 45:50.299
And Lonnie comes up to me,

45:51.125 --> 45:54.299
and he just whispers in my ear,

45:55.162 --> 45:58.065
"Okay, motherfucker.

45:58.090 --> 45:59.758
"You broke it.

45:59.783 --> 46:01.251
"You bought it."

46:07.417 --> 46:08.718
Vince, look...

46:08.785 --> 46:12.054
- No, listen...
- Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

46:12.589 --> 46:15.392
It's best for you not to
say anything right now.

46:22.098 --> 46:23.829
[line ringing]

46:23.854 --> 46:25.023
Marius: Hello?

46:25.048 --> 46:27.250
Okay, by my math,

46:27.604 --> 46:29.700
to keep on track to our deadline,

46:29.725 --> 46:33.042
you should be sitting on about
sixty-thou at this moment.

46:33.109 --> 46:35.945
What are you doing? Are
you calling to fuck with me?

46:36.012 --> 46:37.986
You wanna twirl your
mustache a little bit?

46:38.011 --> 46:41.117
No, I'm calling you because...

46:41.183 --> 46:44.494
Eddie needs to hear his
brother's voice right now.

46:46.129 --> 46:48.664
Get the bolt cutters.

46:48.689 --> 46:50.860
No, no, no! Wait, Vince!

46:50.927 --> 46:52.862
Wait, wait, Vince! Wait, wait, wait!

46:52.929 --> 46:54.312
No, no, no!

46:54.337 --> 46:56.608
[screaming]

46:56.633 --> 47:00.278
No, no, no! No, no, no, Vince!

47:01.000 --> 47:04.040
Vince, I told you I'd take care of this.

47:04.106 --> 47:06.148
Marius can you still hear me?

47:06.173 --> 47:08.730
Vince? Vince, you listen to me.

47:08.755 --> 47:11.376
You've spent years building a
reputation as a man of your word.

47:11.401 --> 47:13.750
If it gets around that you
started chopping Eddie's fingers

47:13.775 --> 47:15.247
before the fuckin' week is up,

47:15.272 --> 47:16.673
all that's out the window!

47:16.698 --> 47:17.832
You hear me?

47:17.857 --> 47:19.025
Vince?

47:19.384 --> 47:21.308
Vince, I'm begging you!

47:21.333 --> 47:23.308
Well, I appreciate that, Marius,

47:23.333 --> 47:25.398
but this is between Eddie and me.

47:25.423 --> 47:27.361
- Just take a second.
- Hey, hey.

47:27.432 --> 47:29.557
Vince? Vince, you want me?

47:29.582 --> 47:31.051
Here I am!

47:31.651 --> 47:34.113
It's too late for that, Marius.

47:34.342 --> 47:36.344
If you want to help your brother,

47:36.497 --> 47:38.833
help him focus on something far away.

47:38.858 --> 47:41.843
Marius! Make him stop!

47:41.875 --> 47:43.615
[sobbing]

47:43.640 --> 47:45.885
Please, Marius.

47:45.910 --> 47:47.637
- Please, no!
- You broke it.

47:47.704 --> 47:49.739
- Please make him stop!
- You bought it.

47:49.806 --> 47:53.176
Marius, please! Please!

47:53.243 --> 47:54.544
[sobbing]

47:54.611 --> 47:56.866
Please, Marius!

47:57.580 --> 48:00.044
Please tell them! Please make them stop!

48:00.069 --> 48:02.672
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, listen to me.

48:02.839 --> 48:04.587
You remember on your ninth birthday,

48:04.955 --> 48:08.257
I took you to ride the
Cyclone at Coney Island,

48:08.907 --> 48:11.461
and we had to sneak
past the ticket taker,

48:11.528 --> 48:13.230
because you were too small?

48:13.296 --> 48:15.198
And when we were clicking
up the first rise,

48:15.265 --> 48:18.034
do you remember what you said to me?

48:18.135 --> 48:20.937
Eddie, what did you say to me?

48:21.615 --> 48:24.841
I said I was scared.

48:25.425 --> 48:27.075
And what did I tell you?

48:27.100 --> 48:29.155
Put my head on your chest.

48:29.846 --> 48:31.281
Close my eyes.

48:31.626 --> 48:34.595
That you would be scared
for the both of us.

48:40.979 --> 48:42.213
Marius...

48:44.508 --> 48:46.044
I'm scared.

48:51.928 --> 48:55.952
[Eddie screaming]
