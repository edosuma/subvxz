You’ve been mad

I figured you were used to it.

it’s a little more competitive
than I thought it would be.

Thanks, Mrs. Regan.

[Henry, muffled] No, she’s
a senior in high school,

16:18.978 --> 16:22.232
but, uh, we’ve known each other
since we were little kids.

16:22.232 --> 16:24.108
Right, McKenna?

Sorry?

but just recently...

16:31.741 --> 16:33.993
[McKenna]
Right, yeah. Um...

16:33.993 --> 16:36.788

about each other

after what happened to Olivia.

Olivia?

What happened, Henry?

I know this might sound
kind of crazy,

17:09.320 --> 17:14.158
but, um,
something strange happened

17:15.660 --> 17:17.036
with Olivia’s death.

17:19.664 --> 17:20.832
What do you mean?

17:20.832 --> 17:23.793
She had a run‐in with a girl,

17:23.793 --> 17:27.797

maybe Marc knew her.

did not go well.

she hates us all now.
