00:00.200 --> 00:01.819
Previously on "The Fosters"...

00:01.819 --> 00:03.450
Monte and I broke up because...

00:03.450 --> 00:05.510
well, she has feelings for somebody else.

00:05.510 --> 00:07.040
Are you having an affair with Monte?

00:07.040 --> 00:10.090
No. I did not kiss her. She kissed me.

00:10.090 --> 00:11.340
Why didn't you tell me?

00:11.340 --> 00:14.230
Judge Jeffrey Ringer continues to block my adoption.

00:14.230 --> 00:15.590
Should she be saying those things?

00:15.590 --> 00:16.820
I don't think you should post it.

00:16.820 --> 00:17.700
It's too late.

00:17.700 --> 00:19.830
What Nate said to me was horrible.

00:19.830 --> 00:21.860
Because, mom, when someone calls one person the n-word,

00:21.860 --> 00:22.730
It hurts all of us.

00:22.730 --> 00:25.470
- Did you call my wife that word? - Not that I recall.

00:25.470 --> 00:28.450
I had sex with someone else when we were still together.

00:28.450 --> 00:31.080
You know about Carmen accusing Rita of hitting her?

00:31.080 --> 00:34.270
And I have a recording of Carmen admitting that she lied.

00:34.270 --> 00:35.900
Carmen knows that I kissed you.

00:35.900 --> 00:38.000
The judge will never let Lena and Stef adopt me.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.500
It just wasn't meant to be.

00:59.800 --> 01:01.440
I should probably go back to my room.

01:01.440 --> 01:02.690
No.

01:03.350 --> 01:05.940
I'm afraid Mariana's going to wake up.

01:06.380 --> 01:07.870
She won't.

01:07.870 --> 01:10.360
That girl sleeps like the dead, you know that.

01:16.290 --> 01:18.550
I wish we could stay here forever.

01:19.050 --> 01:21.180
...and ever and ever.

01:26.640 --> 01:28.370
Do you think they know yet?

01:28.610 --> 01:30.520
They will soon.

01:32.310 --> 01:35.370
If not from my social worker, from Rita.

01:38.430 --> 01:42.440
They're gonna be... so mad.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.400
And hurt.

01:48.630 --> 01:50.870
I think they're going to be most upset

01:50.870 --> 01:52.970
that they can't adopt you.

01:56.680 --> 01:58.170
You okay?

02:00.810 --> 02:02.900
I got you, don't I?

02:07.610 --> 02:09.410
Dibs on the first shower.

02:27.730 --> 02:29.630
I tried baseball with Connor for a while.

02:29.630 --> 02:32.880
That was... it was fun. It was cool.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.040
Hi, Callie. Hi, Brandon.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.240
Hey, Rita. Good to see you.

02:48.180 --> 02:50.960
So we, uh, we heard from Robin.

02:51.660 --> 02:53.730
And she spoke with everyone at Girls United.

02:53.730 --> 02:55.270
She's, um...

02:55.900 --> 02:58.590
She's recommending your adoption.

03:01.300 --> 03:02.920
What about that?

03:10.880 --> 03:12.690
Best news ever.

03:12.800 --> 03:13.770
Isn't that great?

03:13.770 --> 03:15.560
Finally, we did it!

03:15.560 --> 03:17.790
Finally! Can you believe it?

03:17.790 --> 03:20.870
- No, I can't. - So happy. So happy.

04:00.750 --> 04:04.340
Oh... come into my office, will you?

04:05.460 --> 04:06.890
So, did you, um...

04:06.890 --> 04:09.910
You didn't listen to the recording I sent you?

04:09.910 --> 04:12.640
Oh, no, I did. I listened to the whole thing.

04:12.640 --> 04:16.470
Thanks for sending it. You totally saved my ass.

04:16.470 --> 04:20.260
Um, I didn't like everything that I heard on it.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.570
But listen, it's over now, right?

04:23.140 --> 04:26.880
What happened with Brooke and Carmen?

04:27.040 --> 04:28.700
Well, they're back in juvie.

04:28.700 --> 04:32.760
And, uh, Carmen is not going to be in the army any time soon.

04:32.760 --> 04:34.230
She must've been really upset.

04:34.230 --> 04:36.170
Yes, she was.

04:36.170 --> 04:37.790
But I told her I believed in her,

04:37.790 --> 04:39.520
You know, and I forgave her.

04:39.520 --> 04:41.200
And that I know she's not the kind of person

04:41.200 --> 04:43.910
who wants to just go ruin somebody's life

04:43.910 --> 04:45.140
because she can,

04:45.670 --> 04:47.490
especially yours.

04:49.280 --> 04:52.740
You saved me. I save you.

04:52.920 --> 04:57.270
You know why? Because everyone deserves a family.

04:57.270 --> 04:58.840
And this one, kid...

04:58.840 --> 05:00.270
...that's yours.

05:00.270 --> 05:02.410
You enjoy it, all right?

05:03.400 --> 05:06.940
I gotta go home. Call me tomorrow.

05:20.720 --> 05:21.770
Honey?

05:25.090 --> 05:25.860
I...

05:27.410 --> 05:29.670
Do you think we should cancel the party?

05:29.950 --> 05:31.850
I think my parents would understand.

05:31.850 --> 05:33.330
Why? Why would we do that?

05:33.330 --> 05:34.620
Because you're barely speaking to me,

05:34.620 --> 05:35.990
and I don't think we're in a good place right now

05:35.990 --> 05:39.200
to be hosting some big anniversary shindig.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.500
Aren't your parents coming down tonight?

05:40.500 --> 05:42.900
It'd be a little rude to cancel last minute.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.250
I think they'd understand.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.080
I just... I want to give us a little time

05:47.080 --> 05:48.670
so that we can work this out,

05:48.670 --> 05:50.110
we can make this Okay.

05:50.110 --> 05:51.870
Well, nothing is going to make things okay right now,

05:51.870 --> 05:54.670
so we might as well suck it up and have a party.

05:56.860 --> 05:59.450
I gotta get this. Excuse me.

05:59.450 --> 06:01.070
- Stef... - Hello?

06:01.070 --> 06:02.650
Stef? It's Dr. Weiss.

06:02.650 --> 06:04.530
Yes. Hey, how are you? What's going on?

06:04.530 --> 06:07.200
Well, I'm looking at the results of your mammogram,

06:07.200 --> 06:09.690
and they're inconclusive.

06:09.690 --> 06:10.790
Okay.

06:10.790 --> 06:13.780
So we need you to come back in to reimage.

06:15.480 --> 06:19.510
Uh, sure. Uh, should I be worried?

06:20.410 --> 06:21.890
Let's not worry until we know

06:21.890 --> 06:24.220
we have something to worry about.

06:34.590 --> 06:36.400
- What happened? - I don't know.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.170
I guess Rita talked to Carmen,

06:38.170 --> 06:40.700
and it kind of just went away, I guess.

06:40.700 --> 06:41.960
I don't...

06:42.510 --> 06:44.620
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

06:44.620 --> 06:46.050
Calm down. Calm down for a sec.

06:46.050 --> 06:47.110
Everything's going to be all right.

06:47.110 --> 06:48.530
What? How is it going to be all right?

06:48.530 --> 06:50.620
Okay, we had sex.

06:52.440 --> 06:53.680
I-I thought... I thought

06:53.680 --> 06:55.050
the adoption was completely off the table.

06:55.050 --> 06:57.580
I would've... I would've never...

06:57.580 --> 06:59.090
I know. Me neither.

07:03.280 --> 07:05.160
What are we going to do?

07:11.510 --> 07:13.600
Well, look who I found hanging around the airport.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.440
- Oh, hello! - Hello, beautiful!

07:15.440 --> 07:16.730
How are you? How was your trip?

07:16.730 --> 07:18.660
- Oh, good. - Yeah? Uneventful?

07:18.660 --> 07:19.750
- Yes. - Good, good.

07:19.750 --> 07:22.840
Anybody hungry? I got leftovers from dinner.

07:22.840 --> 07:25.950
- No, we just ate at the airport. - Any excuse for pizza.

07:26.670 --> 07:27.900
Well, how about some wine?

07:27.900 --> 07:29.950
Oh, well, we wouldn't say no to that.

07:29.950 --> 07:30.870
I didn't think so.

07:30.870 --> 07:33.750
Thank you both so much for doing this for us.

07:33.750 --> 07:35.890
- Well, we're happy to do it. - Absolutely.

07:35.890 --> 07:37.550
I mean, my goodness, 40 years.

07:37.550 --> 07:39.580
That is, uh... that is quite an accomplishment.

07:39.580 --> 07:41.580
It seems like 40 minutes...

07:41.960 --> 07:43.350
underwater.

07:43.350 --> 07:45.500
- Oh, hey now... - You're so awful.

07:46.180 --> 07:48.430
So, uh, Jesus sends his love.

07:48.540 --> 07:50.060
- Oh, good. - Oh, he's not going to make it?

07:50.060 --> 07:52.390
No. He's got his first big wrestling meet.

07:52.390 --> 07:53.650
Oh, well, we understand.

07:53.650 --> 07:55.710
But it is a shame. It would be nice

07:55.710 --> 07:57.870
to have the whole family together.

08:01.060 --> 08:03.470
Has anyone heard from Nate?

08:05.060 --> 08:06.340
No.

08:09.250 --> 08:11.320
Why would you tell Jenna that you kissed me?

08:11.320 --> 08:14.120
You know why we broke up, right?

08:14.880 --> 08:17.060
I finally told her that the reason

08:17.060 --> 08:18.830
I'm having a hard time falling in love with her

08:18.830 --> 08:21.130
is because I've already...

08:23.000 --> 08:25.750
fallen in love with somebody else.

08:26.260 --> 08:28.550
- With you. - Yeah, I-I got that.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.320
Hey, I know it's not okay. I know.

08:30.320 --> 08:31.850
You don't...

08:34.890 --> 08:36.559
I know you don't feel the same way about me.

08:36.559 --> 08:40.120
And I promise I would never, ever want to break up a marriage.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.700
I just, uh...

08:43.580 --> 08:46.020
I guess I needed to say that out loud.

08:46.020 --> 08:47.560
Did you?

08:49.250 --> 08:52.080
Uh, sorry for barging in, uh...

08:53.060 --> 08:54.850
Have you got a sec?

08:58.570 --> 08:59.650
You slept with him?

08:59.650 --> 09:00.900
Girl, what is wrong with you?

09:00.900 --> 09:03.200
I... I thought the whole adoption thing wasn't...

09:03.200 --> 09:06.020
I was 100% sure that Carmen was going to blow it for me.

09:06.020 --> 09:08.150
So you jump into bed with him the first chance you got?

09:08.150 --> 09:11.260
We were in a cabin, in the woods. Okay? It just happened.

09:11.910 --> 09:13.330
So what are you going to do?

09:13.330 --> 09:15.090
Tell your moms? Call off the adoption?

09:15.090 --> 09:17.920
I can't. It would... it would destroy them.

09:17.920 --> 09:20.310
I don't know what I can do, honestly.

09:22.310 --> 09:24.120
It would be so horrible for me to betray them like that

09:24.120 --> 09:26.040
after everything they've done for me, I...

09:26.040 --> 09:27.470
What about Brandon?

09:27.470 --> 09:28.950
- What about brandon? - Do you love him?

09:28.950 --> 09:31.840
I don't... know. I can't love him now...

09:31.940 --> 09:33.930
I can't... I can't deal with this.

09:33.930 --> 09:36.190
Listen to me. Don't go getting any big ideas

09:36.190 --> 09:38.490
about running away or taking off or something.

09:38.490 --> 09:39.560
You figure it out.

09:39.560 --> 09:42.730
You decide what you want and then you make it happen.

09:45.530 --> 09:48.760
I want you to know how mortified I am

09:48.760 --> 09:50.450
by what I said,

09:50.450 --> 09:52.580
what I called your mom.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.740
I remember.

09:57.480 --> 09:59.400
Of course I remember.

10:00.790 --> 10:03.660
I'll never forget the look on your mom's face after that...

10:04.570 --> 10:06.420
word came out of my mouth.

10:06.420 --> 10:08.360
And the fact that you had to hear it,

10:08.360 --> 10:11.060
makes it a hundred times worse.

10:11.060 --> 10:13.900
I wish I could tell you why I said it.

10:14.270 --> 10:17.060
I think I was just so furious with dad.

10:17.060 --> 10:18.510
For leaving me with mom,

10:18.510 --> 10:22.230
for missing birthdays, for missing every single play I did,

10:22.230 --> 10:24.100
for missing graduation,

10:24.100 --> 10:27.560
for... basically sucking.

10:30.090 --> 10:32.120
Anyway...

10:32.840 --> 10:35.620
I know it's unforgivable.

10:37.010 --> 10:39.790
But I'm glad I at least had the chance

10:39.790 --> 10:42.510
to tell you how sorry I am.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.830
Pretty. What is it?

10:50.540 --> 10:53.950
Oh, it's, uh... a diner where we had our first date.

10:53.950 --> 10:56.890
I had a painter friend of ours make it for Dana.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.410
I hope she likes it.

10:58.410 --> 10:59.590
She will. Trust.

10:59.590 --> 11:00.690
We'll see.

11:00.690 --> 11:03.270
Your grandmother's pretty particular about her gifts.

11:03.270 --> 11:06.830
But, in any case, it's going to be a great evening,

11:06.830 --> 11:08.970
and good food, good friends,

11:08.970 --> 11:12.180
and your brother even offered to play some music for us.

11:12.180 --> 11:15.590
Yeah, Mr. Fancy-pants, award-winning composer,

11:15.590 --> 11:19.980
said he and his buddy Mat are going to do it as our gift.

11:22.290 --> 11:23.940
What's going on?

11:23.940 --> 11:26.550
Nothing. I just...

11:26.940 --> 11:29.300
I did something pretty awful...

11:29.300 --> 11:32.870
And... Mat and me broke up. That's all.

11:32.870 --> 11:35.750
Do you love him? Want him back?

11:36.640 --> 11:38.480
You're going to have to fight for him.

11:38.480 --> 11:39.990
Get him to forgive you.

11:39.990 --> 11:42.490
Yeah, that's pretty unlikely.

11:42.490 --> 11:47.360
Sweetheart, nothing you could ever do, no matter how terrible,

11:48.410 --> 11:51.150
nothing is unforgivable.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.190
I mean, sure he apologized,

11:54.190 --> 11:57.210
but he basically blamed the whole thing on daddy.

11:57.210 --> 11:58.780
He did? Really?

11:59.830 --> 12:00.950
Well, not the whole thing,

12:00.950 --> 12:04.010
But... he might as well have.

12:04.010 --> 12:08.350
Lena, nate had a right to be angry with your dad.

12:08.350 --> 12:10.860
As good a father as he was to you, honey,

12:10.860 --> 12:13.520
he dropped the ball with his son.

12:13.680 --> 12:16.450
So what? That gives him permission to insult you like that?

12:16.450 --> 12:19.730
Of course not, honey, but, you know,

12:19.730 --> 12:23.070
ever since we confronted him, I've been... I've been thinking about

12:23.070 --> 12:24.240
why this whole thing just

12:24.240 --> 12:26.510
never bothered me the way it bothered you.

12:26.510 --> 12:30.240
The truth of the matter is, honey, I think I've always known

12:30.240 --> 12:33.390
that Nate was never actually trying to hurt me.

12:33.390 --> 12:35.430
He was trying to hurt his dad,

12:35.430 --> 12:40.240
by lashing out at the... the one thing he loved the most.

12:40.490 --> 12:44.520
You. But, uh, does that make it okay, mom?

12:44.520 --> 12:47.320
No, it doesn't, but...

12:47.720 --> 12:49.670
I... I understand it,

12:50.620 --> 12:52.850
and I have compassion for this...

12:52.850 --> 12:56.260
very scared, angry young man.

12:57.130 --> 12:59.050
Don't you, baby?

13:04.660 --> 13:07.570
Sorry. I didn't realize you were still rehearsing.

13:07.570 --> 13:10.630
But, um... I have an idea.

13:11.100 --> 13:15.890
I uh, thinking maybe I could sing a song for grams and grandpa?

13:16.900 --> 13:18.650
Do you... sing?

13:18.820 --> 13:20.820
Yes,I sing.

13:20.820 --> 13:23.190
And I was doing some research and it just so happened

13:23.190 --> 13:25.550
that the number one song the year they got married was

13:25.550 --> 13:28.580
"Love Will Keep Us Together" by Captain and Chenille.

13:28.580 --> 13:31.050
Or... something.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.080
Sounds great.

13:33.080 --> 13:36.270
Um, but it'll probably sound better with, uh...

13:36.270 --> 13:38.320
with just piano, so, um,

13:38.320 --> 13:40.150
I'll let you guys to it.

13:45.680 --> 13:48.430
Do you still want to... do the song?

13:49.360 --> 13:51.190
Yeah, of course.

13:55.060 --> 13:57.230
Are you wearing any lotion or perfumes?

13:58.070 --> 13:59.290
Uh, no, I'm not.

13:59.290 --> 14:00.620
Okay, good.

14:00.620 --> 14:02.290
And we're reimaging the left breast?

14:02.290 --> 14:03.260
- Correct. - All right.

14:03.260 --> 14:05.890
Drop the shoulder of your gown, step up to the yellow line.

14:05.890 --> 14:07.060
Arm up.

14:09.980 --> 14:12.340
It must be some pretty nasty stuff, huh?

14:15.870 --> 14:17.980
Looking at these images all day,

14:18.160 --> 14:20.440
probably got a pretty good eye, at this point,

14:20.440 --> 14:22.900
for anything concerning, right?

14:22.900 --> 14:25.540
Yeah. The doctor will call you with your results.

14:25.540 --> 14:27.920
Okay. Here we go.

14:28.620 --> 14:31.060
Stay as still as you can, please.

14:46.330 --> 14:47.360
Hey, bubba.

14:48.740 --> 14:49.750
Jude?

14:52.490 --> 14:53.780
What happened?

14:54.210 --> 14:57.330
I, uh... walked into Connor's room,

14:57.330 --> 14:59.470
and I found the two of them,

14:59.470 --> 15:02.670
making out, with their shirts off.

15:03.870 --> 15:05.670
Uh, what did you do?

15:05.670 --> 15:09.090
I told Jude that it was time for me to take him home.

15:09.090 --> 15:11.250
Okay. So have you, uh...

15:12.040 --> 15:14.940
have you had the talk with Connor yet?

15:23.630 --> 15:26.320
We weren't really doing anything.

15:26.930 --> 15:28.150
Okay.

15:30.520 --> 15:33.530
So... I'm not in trouble?

15:33.530 --> 15:34.820
No.

15:35.650 --> 15:38.940
No, but you're probably going to wish you were.

15:40.460 --> 15:43.150
I think it's time we had the talk.

15:44.680 --> 15:47.340
I'm really happy that you found someone as wonderful

15:47.340 --> 15:49.760
and kind as Connor.

15:50.040 --> 15:51.800
I really am.

15:52.580 --> 15:55.380
And when sex is shared between two people...

15:55.380 --> 15:57.050
Okay, okay.

15:57.470 --> 16:00.240
Connor and I are not having sex.

16:00.240 --> 16:02.400
Oh. Okay. Good.

16:03.670 --> 16:05.160
Good, um...

16:05.160 --> 16:06.140
So...

16:07.500 --> 16:10.080
when any kind of physical intimacy is shared

16:10.080 --> 16:12.550
between two people who care about each other...

16:13.430 --> 16:15.120
...it's a beautiful thing.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.200
Okay, look, if I'm being honest,

16:19.200 --> 16:20.640
I really don't know a whole lot

16:20.640 --> 16:23.450
about the logistics of two men being together,

16:24.310 --> 16:27.200
but, uh, I definitely want you to know

16:27.200 --> 16:28.920
how to take care of yourself

16:28.920 --> 16:31.200
and how to be safe for when the time comes.

16:31.200 --> 16:34.410
Which hopefully won't be for... quite some time.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.640
It won't. I swear.

16:36.640 --> 16:37.850
Okay.

16:39.080 --> 16:40.240
So...

16:42.240 --> 16:44.250
you know what this is, right?

16:46.230 --> 16:47.920
- A condom. - Right.

16:48.370 --> 16:50.320
Do you know how it works?

16:53.660 --> 16:55.230
So, I, um...

16:56.460 --> 16:59.140
I had a little talk with Monte today.

17:01.320 --> 17:02.460
Really?

17:02.460 --> 17:03.810
Yep.

17:04.829 --> 17:07.730
She, uh... she told me that...

17:09.530 --> 17:11.819
she told me that she's in love with me.

17:17.290 --> 17:18.579
What did you say?

17:18.579 --> 17:20.890
I told her I'm in love with my wife.

17:21.329 --> 17:23.859
Well, but there's one thing you didn't keep to yourself.

17:24.480 --> 17:25.780
Really?

17:26.390 --> 17:27.410
You're going to hold this against me...

17:27.410 --> 17:29.410
this one thing that I didn't tell you?

17:29.410 --> 17:31.760
Because I didn't want you to feel weird or...

17:31.760 --> 17:33.870
awkward or whatever.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.480
After the dozens and dozens of secrets you've kept from me.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.860
Oh, is that what we're doing, we're keeping score now?

17:39.550 --> 17:40.840
Really?

17:42.580 --> 17:43.520
Let me ask you this: how does

17:43.520 --> 17:45.340
someone fall in love with someone just like that?

17:45.340 --> 17:48.480
Out of the blue, without any encouragement, Lena?

17:49.000 --> 17:50.510
Did it just happen?

17:50.510 --> 17:51.460
Is it something she caught,

17:51.460 --> 17:53.280
like a virus or a cold? Is it contagious?

17:53.280 --> 17:54.880
Stef, I'm not trying to fight you here.

17:54.880 --> 17:56.580
I'm trying to fight for us.

17:56.580 --> 17:58.300
Are you asking me if I liked the attention?

17:58.300 --> 18:00.090
Because, yes, yes, I did.

18:00.090 --> 18:01.390
I liked it.

18:03.400 --> 18:04.590
I'm not saying that I encouraged it,

18:04.590 --> 18:06.210
but I admit that I didn't do enough to stop it.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.680
Why not?

18:08.390 --> 18:11.160
Why not? Why didn't you?

18:13.190 --> 18:14.860
Because of me? I-I suppose it's my fault

18:14.860 --> 18:18.120
because I didn't pay enough attention to you, is that it?

18:18.930 --> 18:19.810
Thanks.

18:23.640 --> 18:25.410
Well, you know what? It's too bad!

18:25.410 --> 18:28.550
It's too bad! Because between the kids and my work

18:28.550 --> 18:33.530
and my...and everything else, I cannot always put you

18:33.530 --> 18:36.670
as priority number one!

18:40.050 --> 18:41.660
Can we please just get some sleep?

18:41.660 --> 18:44.420
Because we have a very big day tomorrow.

19:34.800 --> 19:37.500
- What are you doing? - I just wanted to see you.

19:42.460 --> 19:43.810
I, um...

19:44.480 --> 19:47.750
I should've said this at the cabin.

19:50.680 --> 19:52.600
I love you.

19:54.020 --> 19:56.000
I love you too.

20:07.150 --> 20:09.160
What if I call Robert? Maybe...

20:13.930 --> 20:15.910
You should probably go back to your room.

20:41.780 --> 20:45.110
But I had no clue, like, what she was planning.

20:45.110 --> 20:47.020
And then she pulled out a condom.

20:47.020 --> 20:48.910
I thought I was going to die.

20:49.450 --> 20:50.470
I mean, for a lesbian,

20:50.470 --> 20:53.730
she sure knows a lot about how guys have sex.

20:54.860 --> 20:58.110
How was your dad? Did he give you the talk too?

20:58.110 --> 20:59.880
Yeah, we had a talk.

21:02.040 --> 21:03.770
I think I'm going to go live with my mom.

21:05.780 --> 21:06.850
In L.A.?

21:08.930 --> 21:09.640
But...

21:11.840 --> 21:12.740
Why?

21:15.370 --> 21:19.230
My dad's not... okay.

21:20.400 --> 21:23.680
With us and... with me.

21:43.220 --> 21:45.250
Hi. I'm really glad you're here.

21:48.370 --> 21:49.260
Daddy.

21:49.270 --> 21:50.350
Yeah?

21:52.250 --> 21:53.210
Hey, dad.

21:54.770 --> 21:55.990
What's he doing here?

21:56.030 --> 21:57.160
I invited him.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.190
I can't do this tonight.

22:00.920 --> 22:01.860
Just...

22:06.380 --> 22:07.210
Daddy.

22:07.740 --> 22:10.300
Listen. Mom and I each had a conversation with Nate.

22:10.750 --> 22:13.870
A really good conversation, and he apologized for everything.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.110
He did?

22:22.580 --> 22:25.830
I have tried since I fell in love with you to protect you

22:25.830 --> 22:28.560
from as much of the racism and

22:28.560 --> 22:31.520
the bigotry in this world as I possibly could.

22:32.950 --> 22:34.050
Oh, my love.

22:36.540 --> 22:39.890
What an impossible task you've given yourself.

22:42.230 --> 22:43.510
It's all right.

22:47.420 --> 22:48.790
We've forgiven him.

22:50.670 --> 22:51.820
You can too.

22:52.950 --> 22:54.560
I promise, it's okay.

22:55.680 --> 22:56.730
It's okay.

23:08.300 --> 23:09.130
Dad...

23:10.050 --> 23:11.200
I'm so sorry.

23:13.950 --> 23:14.880
Me too.

23:22.220 --> 23:23.640
I want to thank you.

23:24.190 --> 23:25.890
Thank you all for being here.

23:25.890 --> 23:28.920
And thank you to my beloved daughter

23:28.920 --> 23:32.440
and her wonderful wife for throwing this shindig

23:32.440 --> 23:34.130
and bringing us all together.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.710
And a special thank you to my son,

23:36.710 --> 23:40.230
and the lovely faith for making this long journey

23:40.230 --> 23:42.730
to get here and be here with us.

23:43.390 --> 23:44.700
I'll never forget it.

23:45.230 --> 23:46.290
It seems like only yesterday...

23:46.290 --> 23:48.810
I am so grateful that your mother called him.

23:48.820 --> 23:51.780
He would never have come out here if he hadn't heard from her.

23:53.730 --> 23:57.920
But mostly, I want to thank my beautiful Dana.

23:58.590 --> 24:02.660
I still can't believe that you agreed to go out with me.

24:02.660 --> 24:04.600
And I still can't believe

24:05.290 --> 24:07.670
that I get to wake up next to you every day.

24:08.480 --> 24:09.680
I'm a lucky man...

24:10.270 --> 24:14.930
to be here surrounded by my friends and my entire family.

24:15.690 --> 24:17.690
Because let's face it, family is everything.

24:18.550 --> 24:20.020
And love is everything.

24:20.610 --> 24:23.940
And what more could I have asked for, in this life,

24:24.560 --> 24:26.570
than to have a moment like this?

24:30.630 --> 24:32.650
Happy anniversary, my love.

24:34.080 --> 24:35.730
Happy anniversary!

24:35.730 --> 24:37.530
- Cheers. - Hear! Hear!

24:37.800 --> 24:39.310
Happy anniversary!

24:52.120 --> 24:53.360
Okay, thank you.

24:56.530 --> 24:57.420
What's wrong?

25:01.210 --> 25:03.200
Well, I wanted to wait until I knew something for sure,

25:03.200 --> 25:07.110
but, um, I had to get a second mammogram.

25:07.110 --> 25:09.970
Because I guess they saw something in the first one.

25:12.380 --> 25:13.220
Why didn't you tell me this?

25:13.220 --> 25:15.700
Because I didn't want to worry you, and...

25:16.500 --> 25:17.670
because I didn't want to need you.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.250
Because I'm mad, I'm really mad.

25:19.250 --> 25:21.370
I'm so... It was...

25:25.480 --> 25:27.300
- What did they say? - I'm fine. I'm fine.

25:27.470 --> 25:29.210
I'm fine, love. I'm fine.

25:30.270 --> 25:31.670
Thank god. Thank god.

25:32.120 --> 25:33.340
Oh, thank god.

25:44.850 --> 25:46.130
Before we go back out there,

25:46.130 --> 25:49.240
there are some things that I need to say to you.

25:49.240 --> 25:52.930
And I know... there are some things you need to say to me.

25:55.270 --> 25:56.750
Can we do that, please?

26:07.510 --> 26:08.480
Yeah.

26:10.450 --> 26:11.620
*Love*

26:12.180 --> 26:15.150
*Love will keep us together*

26:15.910 --> 26:19.090
*Think of me babe whenever*

26:19.680 --> 26:23.790
*Some sweet-talking girl comes along*

26:23.790 --> 26:25.690
*Singing the song*

26:25.690 --> 26:29.040
*Don't mess around, you just gotta be strong*

26:29.050 --> 26:33.210
*Just stop, 'cause I really love you*

26:33.210 --> 26:37.290
*Stop, I'll be thinkin' of you*

26:37.500 --> 26:39.660
You know, I think that this is pretty much

26:39.660 --> 26:43.620
the exact place that we tied the knot.

26:43.620 --> 26:45.950
Yeah, I think you're right about that.

26:45.950 --> 26:47.680
Mm-hmm. I think I am.

26:49.320 --> 26:52.600
And I meant every single word I said that day.

26:53.160 --> 26:55.310
You're the absolute love of my life,

26:56.240 --> 26:59.060
Lena Elizabeth Adams Foster.

27:01.290 --> 27:05.490
And, uh, nothing will ever, ever, ever, ever change that.

27:05.500 --> 27:07.730
*'Cause I really love you*

27:07.730 --> 27:11.710
*Stop, I'll be thinking of you*

27:11.710 --> 27:14.970
*Look in my heart and let love*

27:14.980 --> 27:17.940
*keep us together*

27:17.940 --> 27:20.130
Pardon me, may I, uh, cut in?

27:22.420 --> 27:24.150
Oh, my girl.

27:26.650 --> 27:30.530
So, Faith told me that you called Nate.

27:32.450 --> 27:33.840
Well...

27:37.070 --> 27:38.950
You know, you never cease to amaze me.

27:38.950 --> 27:43.040
I think that is the very best anniversary present

27:43.040 --> 27:44.390
you could've ever given, daddy.

27:46.100 --> 27:49.980
You remember when I said that you used to be my hero?

27:51.070 --> 27:52.270
You still are.

27:57.210 --> 27:58.920
*And I'll need you then*

27:58.980 --> 28:03.200
*Just stop, 'cause I really love you*

28:03.210 --> 28:07.280
*Stop, I'll be thinking of you*

28:07.320 --> 28:11.080
*Look in my heart and let love*

28:11.590 --> 28:15.750
*keep us together*

28:25.090 --> 28:26.180
Thank you.

28:40.770 --> 28:42.260
We could've ruined everything.

28:46.090 --> 28:47.160
But we didn't.

28:49.990 --> 28:51.710
We didn't even break any rules.

28:55.280 --> 28:56.440
Think about it.

28:56.440 --> 28:58.980
Technically, we weren't even fostering

28:58.980 --> 28:59.730
when you came to Idyllwild.

29:00.360 --> 29:01.680
You were staying at G.U.

29:02.890 --> 29:05.290
And the thought of adoption wasn't even a possibility.

29:05.290 --> 29:06.070
Yes, but it...

29:06.070 --> 29:08.300
- We didn't do anything wrong. - You don't think so?

29:19.130 --> 29:20.160
We can't...

29:21.410 --> 29:23.230
We can't ever tell anyone.

29:24.360 --> 29:25.360
I know.

29:28.690 --> 29:29.590
We won't.

29:41.100 --> 29:43.690
It's going to be okay, Callie.

29:51.400 --> 29:53.080
This is your family.

29:56.430 --> 29:58.130
That's all that matters.

30:19.690 --> 30:20.610
Come in.

30:20.610 --> 30:22.090
Hey. Thanks.

30:26.400 --> 30:27.960
Is Connor ready yet?

30:28.400 --> 30:31.240
Yeah, he's, um, just getting his jacket.

30:35.110 --> 30:36.370
Can I ask you a question?

30:37.110 --> 30:37.840
Yeah.

30:39.150 --> 30:40.730
Why are you sending Connor away?

30:42.380 --> 30:43.750
I-I'm not.

30:44.140 --> 30:45.320
I-I didn't.

30:45.860 --> 30:47.690
Look, I'm trying here, okay?

30:47.980 --> 30:49.720
I'm doing the best that I can.

30:51.530 --> 30:53.570
Connor asked to go live with his mom.

30:56.080 --> 30:57.750
- Ready? - Yeah.

30:58.840 --> 30:59.940
See you tomorrow, right?

31:01.770 --> 31:02.680
See ya.

31:13.360 --> 31:16.220
Look, I know I made a mistake,

31:17.050 --> 31:21.150
a huge one, and if you can't get over it, then that's fine.

31:21.740 --> 31:23.360
I have to live with that, but...

31:24.400 --> 31:26.620
I'm not going to beg and grovel anymore.

31:27.030 --> 31:29.020
I'm not going to beg you to forgive me 'cause...

31:30.830 --> 31:32.000
I forgive me.

31:37.760 --> 31:38.650
Okay.

31:40.250 --> 31:41.360
Okay?

31:42.120 --> 31:44.190
Does that... mean you're willing

31:44.190 --> 31:46.290
to try to get back together?

31:48.890 --> 31:49.820
No.

31:52.500 --> 31:54.940
But I'm glad you stopped beating yourself up about it.

31:59.670 --> 32:00.600
Good night.

32:09.840 --> 32:14.160
Um, so, firstly, I want to say, um...

32:15.680 --> 32:19.810
I've been really overwhelmed by all your messages.

32:21.070 --> 32:23.300
If I've inspired you in any way, 

32:24.670 --> 32:26.190
it just makes it all worth it.

32:26.340 --> 32:27.230
So...

32:28.180 --> 32:31.680
so I am getting adopted tomorrow.

32:33.880 --> 32:36.420
I... I can't even believe it's finally going to happen.

32:36.420 --> 32:39.980
You guys have no idea what a ride it's been.

32:42.580 --> 32:44.040
I'm just really happy.

32:47.850 --> 32:49.350
I do want you to know that it doesn't mean

32:49.350 --> 32:52.290
that I'm... leaving you.

32:54.030 --> 32:55.960
I'll always be a foster kid.

33:00.120 --> 33:02.090
Yeah, thanks for listening.

33:16.110 --> 33:17.260
Hi, you guys.

33:17.870 --> 33:19.160
Thank you for coming.

33:25.480 --> 33:27.670
Excuse me. I... I need to talk to you.

33:28.120 --> 33:30.710
Oh, yeah. Uh, Lena? Lena, honey?

33:35.190 --> 33:37.920
The judge saw some website of Callie's

33:37.920 --> 33:41.350
Fost and something, and he didn't like it, at all.

33:41.350 --> 33:42.780
Why-why wouldn't he like it?

33:42.790 --> 33:45.400
Apparently, there's a video where you talk about him.

33:46.330 --> 33:47.520
So, the first thing we need to do

33:47.520 --> 33:48.510
when we get into that courtroom,

33:48.510 --> 33:51.090
we have to apologize, you need to apologize.

33:51.090 --> 33:53.360
- Do you understand me? - Apologize for what?

33:53.360 --> 33:55.970
For insulting Judge Ringer in that video you posted.

33:55.970 --> 33:58.450
I didn't insult him. I was just telling the truth.

33:58.450 --> 34:01.220
I'm not... i'm not going to apologize for that.

34:02.280 --> 34:04.340
Callie, think about this, please.

34:04.340 --> 34:06.110
This might not be the moment for you to...

34:06.110 --> 34:08.800
What? Stand up for what I believe in?

34:09.530 --> 34:11.870
I love you both, with all of my heart,

34:11.870 --> 34:13.790
and you know how much I want to be a part of this family,

34:13.790 --> 34:17.199
but I can't take back what I said.

34:17.330 --> 34:19.739
I mean, there's too many people counting on me. I can't.

34:25.380 --> 34:27.190
So, do you understand what this means?

34:38.960 --> 34:41.110
- She's here. - There she is.

34:48.110 --> 34:49.989
What is going on?

34:50.330 --> 34:53.610
They're foster kids. They're here to support Callie.

35:01.820 --> 35:04.400
All right, everyone, thank you. That's enough.

35:07.330 --> 35:09.480
Well, Callie, welcome back.

35:10.590 --> 35:12.340
I wish I could say I was entirely happy to see you.

35:12.340 --> 35:14.080
Unfortunately, I was sent a video

35:14.080 --> 35:15.250
which I found somewhat upsetting,

35:15.250 --> 35:18.530
and, quite frankly, a little insulting.

35:19.080 --> 35:20.860
I didn't mean to offend you, sir.

35:21.210 --> 35:21.830
Really?

35:21.830 --> 35:24.150
You, uh, called me out by name.

35:25.020 --> 35:27.280
You said I was making these decisions about your life

35:27.280 --> 35:29.680
without any consideration of what you wanted.

35:29.680 --> 35:31.220
Because that's how it felt.

35:33.500 --> 35:36.520
The system is broken, sir, badly.

35:36.940 --> 35:39.110
And the only people who really understand just how bad

35:39.110 --> 35:42.510
are the ones without any say, without any voice.

35:43.530 --> 35:45.600
Somebody has got to speak up.

35:45.890 --> 35:48.050
And that someone is going to be you, is it?

35:48.050 --> 35:51.430
Yes. I'm one of the lucky ones.

35:51.430 --> 35:54.150
You know, I... found an amazing family,

35:54.160 --> 35:56.570
and I'm finally safe and loved,

35:56.570 --> 35:59.500
like, really, truly loved.

36:01.400 --> 36:04.260
And one of the things I've learned from my moms,

36:04.260 --> 36:05.140
from watching the way they've lived their lives,

36:05.140 --> 36:07.460
is that when you're lucky,

36:07.880 --> 36:10.120
it is your job to give something back.

36:10.120 --> 36:11.770
And when you see something wrong,

36:11.850 --> 36:13.770
to stand up and to say so.

36:15.170 --> 36:17.670
So, I'm really sorry if I offended you.

36:17.680 --> 36:19.260
It was not my intention.

36:20.620 --> 36:22.750
I'm not going to apologize for standing up.

36:23.710 --> 36:24.980
Somebody has to.

36:32.430 --> 36:35.640
Well, I wish it weren't the case...

36:36.420 --> 36:38.520
but there's a lot of truth in what you're saying.

36:39.220 --> 36:41.850
It's no secret the system is failing a lot of kids,

36:43.530 --> 36:45.860
and that someone needs to do something about it.

36:48.110 --> 36:50.040
I'm proud of you for being that person.

36:53.420 --> 36:54.020
Quiet, please.

36:54.020 --> 36:55.270
Quiet, please.

36:55.590 --> 36:58.700
Now, your social worker has done a thorough investigation

36:59.280 --> 37:01.040
of the restraining order against Brandon Foster

37:01.040 --> 37:03.020
and tells me there is no reason to believe

37:03.020 --> 37:05.430
there's anything here to prevent your adoption.

37:05.430 --> 37:06.400
Is that correct?

37:06.500 --> 37:08.270
There's nothing romantic

37:08.270 --> 37:10.390
going on with you and Brandon any longer?

37:12.900 --> 37:14.380
No, your honor, that's over.

37:15.270 --> 37:17.400
Well, then I see no reason not to make it official.

37:24.030 --> 37:25.450
Congratulations, Callie.

37:26.440 --> 37:29.720
You're officially a member of the Adams Foster family.

38:33.810 --> 38:35.940
One of the happiest days of my life.

38:37.550 --> 38:40.670
Hey, bro. I've been thinking.

38:41.230 --> 38:45.100
Maybe... maybe you should go live with your mom.

38:46.090 --> 38:48.000
At first, when your dad said

38:48.000 --> 38:49.830
that you asked him to let you go,

38:50.760 --> 38:51.940
I didn't get it...

38:52.730 --> 38:54.630
at all, but...

38:55.360 --> 38:58.050
I was watching you in there when Callie was talking

38:58.050 --> 39:00.200
about how great it is to finally be...

39:01.080 --> 39:04.370
you know, happy and safe,

39:04.550 --> 39:08.240
and to have a family that is really, truly there for her.

39:09.960 --> 39:11.750
And I want you to have that.

39:12.720 --> 39:13.750
Because...

39:15.300 --> 39:16.450
I love you.

39:20.140 --> 39:21.210
I love you too.

39:25.680 --> 39:27.320
L.A. isn't that far, right?

39:27.880 --> 39:30.050
I mean, there are trains.

39:49.740 --> 39:51.460
Hey, Moms, can you come in here for a sec?

39:51.460 --> 39:53.310
There's someone here to see you.

39:54.400 --> 39:55.600
What? Who's here?

39:57.480 --> 39:58.560
Surprise.

39:59.540 --> 40:00.440
Jesus!

40:00.440 --> 40:02.040
Oh, my god! Look at you!

40:02.050 --> 40:04.720
You got so tall. What is going on?

40:04.720 --> 40:06.790
What are they feeding you over there?

40:07.620 --> 40:10.520
I thought you were at some big wrestling thing or something.

40:10.520 --> 40:12.380
That was just a cover so I could surprise you.

40:12.380 --> 40:14.690
I was trying to get here in time for Callie's adoption,

40:14.690 --> 40:16.390
but my flight got delayed.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.550
I didn't want to miss this,

40:18.920 --> 40:21.170
and our first night together as a family.

40:21.170 --> 40:23.850
Right? We're all together!

40:25.220 --> 40:26.010
Is there any food?

40:26.010 --> 40:27.460
- Oh, my goodness. - I'm starving.

40:27.470 --> 40:28.810
What a surprise. Of course.

40:28.810 --> 40:31.890
Let's make some dinner for Jesus.

40:32.860 --> 40:34.750
Okay. We need some music.

40:36.250 --> 40:38.410
Aw, I'm so happy you're here.

40:39.120 --> 40:40.940
I don't want you to go back.

40:41.410 --> 40:45.940
Yeah. I, um... I can't go back.

40:47.790 --> 40:48.730
All right, you guys. Enough of the reunion.

40:48.730 --> 40:51.220
Let's go. Mariana, set the table, please.

40:51.220 --> 40:52.990
Jesus, how about you grab a sharp knife

40:52.990 --> 40:56.520
and start chopping vegetables we can use for a salad?

40:57.305 --> 41:03.280
