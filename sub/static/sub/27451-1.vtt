01:32.744 --> 01:34.184
Love it. And perfect timing.

01:34.224 --> 01:36.792
I just picked her up
from the airport.

01:36.835 --> 01:38.074
Well, yeah,
we're heading over there now

01:38.098 --> 01:40.491
to officially move her in.

01:40.535 --> 01:42.165
Oh, can you make sure
that he has a spreadsheet

01:42.189 --> 01:44.016
with all my information?

01:44.060 --> 01:47.150
Uh, sorry to ask again.

01:47.194 --> 01:49.239
Um, my sister wants
to triple check

01:49.283 --> 01:50.980
that you've got
her spreadsheets.

01:51.023 --> 01:53.548
The one that shows
where all of the boxes go.

01:53.591 --> 01:57.160
Awesome.
Yeah, personally, I don't care.

01:57.204 --> 01:59.423
Um, but she can be a bit of a...

02:00.468 --> 02:02.078
She's meticulous.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.820
Ooh.

02:04.863 --> 02:07.170
Yeah, well, good to hear.

02:07.214 --> 02:09.192
Thank you so much. You've been
such a big help this week.

02:09.216 --> 02:12.088
One last question.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.438
One of the movers,
the tall guy, uh,

02:14.482 --> 02:17.354
you know, thick beard,
thick arms, everything thick.

02:17.398 --> 02:19.226
What's his deal?

02:19.269 --> 02:22.707
Is he single
or seeing someone or...

02:22.751 --> 02:24.056
- Sto...
- Meghan!

02:24.100 --> 02:26.146
What? Doesn't hurt to ask.

02:26.189 --> 02:27.756
All right, well,
I will let you go.

02:27.799 --> 02:30.411
Um, but-but thank you again
for everything.

02:33.196 --> 02:35.633
Are you seeing this guy?

02:35.677 --> 02:39.376
Welcome back
to the neighborhood.

02:51.606 --> 02:53.477
Here we are.

02:53.521 --> 02:55.784
Thanks for talking me
into coming back home.

02:55.827 --> 02:59.048
I really needed
to get out of LA.

02:59.091 --> 03:03.748
Please. I'm just glad
you finally came to your senses.

03:03.792 --> 03:06.447
Plus, it'll be amazing
living under one roof again.

03:23.986 --> 03:25.268
Whit, could you be any slower?

03:25.292 --> 03:26.641
I'm coming.

03:36.128 --> 03:37.260
Welcome home.

03:37.304 --> 03:40.132
It still feels the same.

03:40.176 --> 03:42.613
Is that a good thing?

03:42.657 --> 03:44.963
Yeah. It's a good thing.

03:48.445 --> 03:49.596
- Hi, Maya.
- What's up, Whit?

03:49.620 --> 03:52.275
Tell your manager to buzz off.

03:52.319 --> 03:53.450
She's ruining this moment.

03:53.494 --> 03:55.278
Does Meghan not realize

03:55.322 --> 03:58.455
that she's on speaker phone?

03:58.499 --> 04:01.328
How's my Instagram star doin'?

04:01.371 --> 04:03.068
Well, we're here.

04:03.112 --> 04:05.288
There's a bunch of boxes
we still have to unpack...

04:05.332 --> 04:08.030
Sounds great. Uh, wanted
to give you a heads-up.

04:08.073 --> 04:11.338
The Coriander people moved
your photoshoot to Thursday.

04:11.381 --> 04:14.297
I updated your calendar and
emailed you a new itinerary.

04:14.341 --> 04:15.298
Thanks.

04:15.342 --> 04:16.647
Am I seeing you at

04:16.690 --> 04:18.214
the housewarming party
tomorrow night?

04:18.257 --> 04:20.390
There's gonna be tons

04:20.434 --> 04:22.262
of social-media influencers
from Boston,

04:22.305 --> 04:24.655
and plenty of them are gonna
need some representation,

04:24.699 --> 04:25.917
so you better not bail.

04:25.961 --> 04:27.876
Of course I'll be there.

04:27.919 --> 04:29.854
And I'm bringing you a very
special housewarming gift

04:29.878 --> 04:33.316
that I think you'll like.

04:33.360 --> 04:36.450
You cannot tease me like that.
You know I hate surprises.

04:36.493 --> 04:37.712
See you tomorrow!

04:37.755 --> 04:40.367
Dress to impress, please!

04:40.410 --> 04:41.759
Bye!

04:53.771 --> 04:57.079
One year. Almost to the day.

04:58.689 --> 05:00.343
They'd be so pumped, Whit,

05:00.387 --> 05:02.737
having you back in the house.

05:02.780 --> 05:04.695
And it's unreal, I never thought

05:04.739 --> 05:07.916
you'd move back to Boston,
let alone here.

05:07.959 --> 05:10.745
Yeah, LA's great, it's just...

05:10.788 --> 05:13.008
It's not my home.

05:13.051 --> 05:16.011
I miss the comfort.
I miss the seasons.

05:16.054 --> 05:17.989
- You missed the seafood.
- Oh, I totally miss the seafood.

05:18.013 --> 05:20.711
- Yeah.
- And you. I missed you.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.149
You wanna see something cool?

05:25.194 --> 05:26.413
- Yeah.
- Come on.

05:28.502 --> 05:31.287
Is that dad's chair?

05:31.331 --> 05:33.811
- You kept it?
- Of course I kept it.

05:33.855 --> 05:35.944
We loved this chair.

05:35.987 --> 05:38.599
Remember when we were little
and dad used to watch the game

05:38.642 --> 05:40.035
and I'd just hop in?

05:40.078 --> 05:41.558
And then
I'd get insanely jealous

05:41.602 --> 05:43.125
and hop in after.

05:43.168 --> 05:45.345
Just one big Sadler sandwich.

05:45.388 --> 05:48.783
This is why I moved back home,
for memories like that.

05:48.826 --> 05:50.698
It's all we have left.

05:50.741 --> 05:53.309
And we had
a lot of good ones here.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.050
And some bad ones.

05:55.093 --> 05:59.881
There are plenty of awkward
teen memories I'd rather forget.

05:59.924 --> 06:02.231
I don't know, I think
you kind of really rocked

06:02.274 --> 06:05.843
the side pony and braces your
freshman year of high school.

06:05.887 --> 06:08.368
Should I whip out the yearbook
to remind you?

06:08.411 --> 06:10.805
Rather die. Thank you.

06:14.461 --> 06:18.769
You know, we could make
some new memories, Whit.

06:18.813 --> 06:21.729
Oh, are we gonna do the whole
travel-the-world routine again?

06:21.772 --> 06:24.122
You have money to spend.

06:24.166 --> 06:26.081
Live dangerously, explore!

06:26.124 --> 06:28.300
I mean, you say the word
and I'll quit my dumb job

06:28.344 --> 06:30.433
and we can run away
in a heartbeat.

06:30.477 --> 06:34.481
I have a plan, Meg, and that's
make connections on this coast,

06:34.524 --> 06:38.006
grow my brand, save money
for my children's college fund.

06:38.049 --> 06:40.269
You're literally
the only single person I know

06:40.312 --> 06:44.447
who's saving for a hypothetical
child's education.

06:44.491 --> 06:45.883
Two hypothetical children.

06:50.975 --> 06:52.890
Oh, look at this view.

06:52.934 --> 06:54.501
Huh. I know, right?

06:56.024 --> 06:57.939
Say hello to Mike.

06:58.505 --> 07:00.245
Hello, Mike.

07:01.290 --> 07:02.378
He's single.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.686
Just in case
you were interested.

07:05.729 --> 07:06.991
Is he nice?

07:07.035 --> 07:07.992
I don't really know him.

07:08.036 --> 07:09.559
He's been here a few months.

07:09.603 --> 07:11.648
That's his mom's house.

07:11.692 --> 07:12.886
Oh, the woman in the wheelchair?

07:12.910 --> 07:14.434
Yeah, his dad died and he's been

07:14.477 --> 07:16.392
taking care of his mom
ever since.

07:17.872 --> 07:20.614
Well, that's sweet.

07:20.657 --> 07:24.356
Do you think I should warn him
about the party tomorrow night?

07:24.400 --> 07:26.576
I think that's a valid reason
to talk to him.

07:29.927 --> 07:32.843
Okay, so I know you guys are
sick and tired of me talking

07:32.887 --> 07:36.107
about my move home to Boston,
and I know, I know, I know

07:36.151 --> 07:38.414
I've been totally oversharing,
but...

07:38.458 --> 07:41.373
I'm finally here!

07:41.417 --> 07:43.245
Yay!

07:43.288 --> 07:45.073
I'm gonna be working
with local boutiques

07:45.116 --> 07:46.442
and shooting
with local photographers,

07:46.466 --> 07:49.294
and I just can't wait
to show you what's next.

08:01.045 --> 08:03.526
Oh. Hi.

08:03.570 --> 08:06.573
Hi. I wanted to come over
and say hello.

08:09.576 --> 08:12.796
I'm Mike... Vincent.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.624
I'm Whitney Sadler.

08:14.668 --> 08:18.498
Yeah. Yeah, I saw you pull up
this morning.

08:18.541 --> 08:21.283
- Hm.
- Not that I was watching you.

08:21.326 --> 08:23.546
That, that kinda sounded weird.

08:23.590 --> 08:27.071
Um, nothing creepy.

08:27.115 --> 08:30.248
Okay. Uh, you need any help
with anything?

08:30.292 --> 08:33.251
- Furniture or TVs...
- Oh...

08:33.294 --> 08:35.340
God, no. No, I wouldn't impose.

08:35.384 --> 08:38.126
No, it wouldn't be a problem.
I work at the hardware store.

08:38.169 --> 08:41.563
I do home repair stuff
on the side.

08:41.607 --> 08:43.434
Good to know.

08:44.654 --> 08:46.743
Yeah.

08:46.787 --> 08:48.528
I was actually gonna tell you

08:48.571 --> 08:51.443
that I'm, I'm having a party
tomorrow. Tomorrow night.

08:51.487 --> 08:55.012
It's a housewarming thing and I
didn't want to disturb you

08:55.056 --> 08:57.580
and your... My mom. Mm.

08:57.624 --> 08:59.364
Yeah. Kathy.

08:59.408 --> 09:02.411
Uh, no, no.
Don't, don't worry about us.

09:02.454 --> 09:04.718
The, the noise won't bother us,
especially not her.

09:04.761 --> 09:08.722
She, she hasn't been doing
so well lately.

09:08.765 --> 09:09.766
- Um...
- Oh. I'm sorry.

09:09.810 --> 09:11.725
But, no, it's, plus it'll bring

09:11.768 --> 09:14.510
some excitement to the block.
That'll be fun.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.731
Oh, I don't know
if I'll bring any excitement.

09:17.774 --> 09:21.909
I, uh, I actually grew up here
in this house.

09:21.952 --> 09:23.693
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:23.737 --> 09:25.260
What brought you back?

09:26.957 --> 09:31.179
Um... New beginnings, I guess.

09:31.222 --> 09:33.573
Yeah,
I know exactly what you mean.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.161
You know, if you wanted,
you could swing by

09:37.185 --> 09:39.230
the party tomorrow.

09:39.274 --> 09:41.537
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.627
Yeah. There's gonna be
a bunch of people here.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.194
A lot
of social-media influencers,

09:46.237 --> 09:48.326
if that's your sort of thing.

09:48.370 --> 09:50.459
No, not too much.

09:50.502 --> 09:52.635
To be honest,
I don't really keep up

09:52.679 --> 09:56.334
with the Facebook
or Instatweet...

09:56.378 --> 09:58.641
- Instatweet?
- The Vine?

09:58.685 --> 10:00.164
Is the Vine a thing?

10:00.208 --> 10:02.514
- No, uh, well, used to be.
- Yeah.

10:02.558 --> 10:05.430
That's really nice you're
disconnected from that world.

10:05.474 --> 10:07.258
I live in it 'cause it's my job

10:07.302 --> 10:11.045
and it's... it's exhausting.

10:11.088 --> 10:12.742
Seems that way.

10:18.705 --> 10:22.012
- I should get back. All right.
- Okay.

10:22.056 --> 10:23.753
I'll see you at the party
tomorrow?

10:23.797 --> 10:25.407
I wouldn't miss it.

10:25.450 --> 10:27.539
Nice to meet you, Mike.

11:00.181 --> 11:01.530
Meg?

11:27.034 --> 11:28.122
Hello?

11:33.823 --> 11:34.998
Meg?

11:47.054 --> 11:48.446
Hello?

12:01.851 --> 12:02.939
Meg?

12:04.027 --> 12:06.595
Oh, my God!

12:06.638 --> 12:09.511
What the...
What are you doing up so late?

12:09.554 --> 12:11.687
I-I couldn't sleep.
I wanted a snack.

12:14.081 --> 12:18.259
Huh? Must have forgot to shut
the door when I got home.

12:18.302 --> 12:19.956
Who closed it?

12:21.610 --> 12:23.960
I don't know.
Maybe it's a spooky ghost.

12:24.004 --> 12:27.137
Oh... Go to
bed, you scaredy-cat.

12:44.546 --> 12:47.679
Hey, guys, so as you know,
I love my products

12:47.723 --> 12:51.118
and I just discovered
my new favorite lip whip.

12:51.161 --> 12:54.295
It's called True Moringa,
it's organic, it's gluten-free

12:54.338 --> 12:56.340
and it's a 100% vegan.

12:56.384 --> 12:58.908
Oh, this packaging is so cute!

13:01.215 --> 13:04.784
It's a perfect way
to add a little pop to your day.

13:26.109 --> 13:29.373
Maya! Oh, my gosh!
I'm so happy you're here.

13:29.417 --> 13:31.375
Love the place.

13:31.419 --> 13:33.987
It's a little far from LA,
but...

13:34.030 --> 13:35.466
Oh... Okay.

13:35.510 --> 13:36.816
Here, come on.

13:41.690 --> 13:43.300
- Lucas?
- Whitney!

13:43.344 --> 13:46.695
- What are you doing here?
- Hey. Look at you. Wow!

13:46.738 --> 13:48.349
Told you
I had a surprise for you.

13:48.392 --> 13:50.742
- Surprise...
- Yeah. -Surprise.

13:50.786 --> 13:52.483
Maya and I have been

13:52.527 --> 13:54.268
cooking up something so special

13:54.311 --> 13:57.010
and I know you're gonna love it,
but I want to...

13:57.053 --> 14:00.056
Oh. God, sorry. Uh, Lucas,
this is my sister, Meghan.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.406
Meghan, well, nice to meet you.

14:02.450 --> 14:04.844
As Lucas was saying,
he and I have been talking

14:04.887 --> 14:06.909
for the past couple of weeks
and I think you'll find

14:06.933 --> 14:08.978
he has
a very interesting proposal.

14:09.022 --> 14:11.502
I got the endorsement deal with
H2Almond, the new almond water.

14:11.546 --> 14:14.723
That's huge. They were a top
seller in the market last year.

14:14.766 --> 14:16.551
That's right,
and they want me to headline

14:16.594 --> 14:17.552
their new online ad campaign.

14:17.595 --> 14:19.597
- That's amazing!
- It is.

14:19.641 --> 14:21.861
But they wanna pair me
with someone.

14:21.904 --> 14:23.906
Like a female counterpart.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.734
I don't know,
but I recommended you.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.260
- Me?
- Yeah.

14:30.304 --> 14:32.610
Look, I know,
I know sponsored content

14:32.654 --> 14:34.351
isn't necessarily very cool,

14:34.395 --> 14:38.225
but it is a easy way
to make a ton of money.

14:38.268 --> 14:40.705
And, you know,
I'm just a big fan of your work.

14:40.749 --> 14:42.533
That's unbelievably kind.

14:42.577 --> 14:44.492
And just to be clear, it is

14:44.535 --> 14:46.798
an unbelievable amount of money.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.931
This sounds like
something we should celebrate.

14:48.975 --> 14:52.195
- A toast to H2Almond!
- There we go.

14:52.239 --> 14:55.111
- Can I get you a beer or wine...
- No, no.

14:55.155 --> 14:58.071
I don't drink, but thank you.

14:58.114 --> 14:59.942
So what do you say, Whitney?

15:01.509 --> 15:02.945
Can I think about it?

15:02.989 --> 15:04.357
Oh, yeah, of course,
no, that's fine.

15:04.381 --> 15:06.818
I-I get it,
they're probably gonna want

15:06.862 --> 15:08.908
something sooner than later,
though, so...

15:08.951 --> 15:11.040
Okay, uh, tomorrow night,
are you free?

15:11.084 --> 15:13.129
We can grab a drink or...

15:13.173 --> 15:15.305
- Dinner. Let's grab dinner.
- Dinner? Right, yeah.

15:15.349 --> 15:16.669
I can do dinner,
dinner's perfect.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.875
Gotta take this,
all right, so...

15:19.919 --> 15:21.964
Hi, this is Lucas.
Hey, what's goin'...

15:22.008 --> 15:23.661
What was that?

15:23.705 --> 15:25.750
Lucas has 8.8 million followers.

15:25.794 --> 15:28.057
He can open
all sorts of doors for you.

15:28.101 --> 15:30.451
Landing on his feet alone
can double your impact.

15:30.494 --> 15:33.976
It's a huge move, I know
it would do a lot for my brand,

15:34.020 --> 15:37.458
but it's just
a whole other level of exposure.

15:37.501 --> 15:40.069
And that is a good thing,
Whitney, uh...

15:40.113 --> 15:41.723
I get that you have had
some issues...

15:41.766 --> 15:44.073
Those weren't issues.

15:44.117 --> 15:46.380
She had stalkers in LA.

15:46.423 --> 15:49.165
I have seen plenty like them.
They're just trolls.

15:49.209 --> 15:51.994
Maya, this wasn't just a troll.

15:52.038 --> 15:54.083
This guy found out where I lived

15:54.127 --> 15:56.956
and then took photographs of me
in my apartment.

15:58.522 --> 16:02.265
All right. I'm sorry.

16:02.309 --> 16:04.572
Whitney, you know that I just
want what's best for you,

16:04.615 --> 16:07.488
but you have already moved
3000 miles east of relevant

16:07.531 --> 16:10.404
for a fresh start,
I just don't want to see you

16:10.447 --> 16:12.232
miss out on an opportunity
like this one

16:12.275 --> 16:14.886
because of some troll
living in his mom's basement,

16:14.930 --> 16:16.671
especially now
that you have moved

16:16.714 --> 16:18.412
all the way across the country.

16:18.455 --> 16:19.674
I know, I know.

16:19.717 --> 16:21.284
Whit, I mean, you've been

16:21.328 --> 16:23.939
really blessed in this life,

16:23.983 --> 16:28.465
but one of these days you're
gonna lose something awesome

16:28.509 --> 16:32.034
because you were too scared
to leap before you look.

16:32.078 --> 16:35.081
Okay, believe in your instincts.
I do.

16:36.430 --> 16:38.693
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna go get another drink.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.828
She's not wrong.

17:02.108 --> 17:03.196
You made it.

17:03.239 --> 17:05.849
- Hi.
- Hi. Come in.

17:05.894 --> 17:09.723
I'm sorry, didn't really
know what you drink,

17:09.767 --> 17:13.292
if you need anything, so I
figured flowers were a safe bet.

17:14.511 --> 17:16.512
Flowers are always a safe bet.

17:16.557 --> 17:19.690
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:19.733 --> 17:22.084
- Do you want a drink?
- Yes, please.

17:45.586 --> 17:46.630
Oh.

17:50.156 --> 17:53.681
So you know all these people
or, or what?

17:56.162 --> 17:59.121
- No?
- Can I tell you a secret?

17:59.165 --> 18:00.514
Sure.

18:02.298 --> 18:05.519
I hate these kinds of parties.
I do. Yeah.

18:05.562 --> 18:09.262
I kinda have to do it for my
work 'cause of networking and...

18:10.350 --> 18:14.963
connections and...
It's just not real.

18:15.006 --> 18:17.357
- Yeah.
- I'm glad you're here.

18:21.665 --> 18:24.538
Hi, uh, sorry to interrupt,

18:24.581 --> 18:27.367
but the sink has exploded
and water's spraying everywhere

18:27.410 --> 18:29.388
and I'm not paid nearly enough
to deal with that, so...

18:29.412 --> 18:32.459
- I can fix it.
- No. Absolutely not.

18:32.502 --> 18:35.549
It's fine, I do it every day.
It'll take two minutes.

18:35.592 --> 18:37.203
Be right back.

18:37.246 --> 18:39.335
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

19:04.404 --> 19:06.188
All fixed.

19:06.232 --> 19:07.711
- You okay?
- Yeah, sorry.

19:07.755 --> 19:09.844
- You just startled me.
- Oh.

19:09.887 --> 19:11.541
Was it bad?

19:11.585 --> 19:15.415
I actually had to, had to save
this guy from drowning.

19:15.458 --> 19:18.809
He was literally gonna die
for a bathroom selfie.

19:18.853 --> 19:21.029
There was water everywhere,
it was intense.

19:21.072 --> 19:23.901
Now, I-I put some towels down,
and it'll be fine.

19:23.945 --> 19:26.208
- Don't worry about it.
- You're too much.

19:26.252 --> 19:27.620
Hey, Whitney,
I-I got to get out of here.

19:27.644 --> 19:29.231
- I got a shoot in the morning.
- Okay, well.

19:29.255 --> 19:30.580
- Get your beauty sleep.
- All right.

19:30.604 --> 19:33.215
- Mwah! Mwah! Ha-ha.
- Not that you need it.

19:33.259 --> 19:35.304
- What's up, man? Mike.
- Oh.

19:35.348 --> 19:38.568
- Whitney's neighbor.
- Nice to meet you, Mike.

19:38.612 --> 19:40.614
Um, so I'll see you soon?

19:40.657 --> 19:42.311
- Can't wait.
- Maya.

19:42.355 --> 19:44.487
I'll walk you out.

19:47.882 --> 19:51.538
So I'm gonna assume
he's a big Instagram guy.

19:51.581 --> 19:53.409
Good assumption.

19:53.453 --> 19:55.933
- So you guys have known each...
- Hey, Whitney!

19:55.977 --> 19:58.153
I love your content.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.373
- Thanks.
- Greg. I'm Greg.

20:00.416 --> 20:03.245
Actually, could I get a selfie?

20:03.289 --> 20:06.074
Thank you so much.

20:06.117 --> 20:09.556
This is perfect.

20:09.599 --> 20:11.273
I'm sorry, what's your handle?
I don't think I know you.

20:11.297 --> 20:14.822
Oh, I, uh, I came with someone,
one of your guests.

20:14.865 --> 20:17.694
I'd love a follow back, though.

20:17.738 --> 20:20.088
- Who'd you come with?
- Umm... Lucas.

20:20.131 --> 20:21.394
I came with him and, uh,

20:21.437 --> 20:23.091
I chilled with him
most of the night.

20:23.134 --> 20:24.397
Yeah, he already left.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.747
Did he? Shoot.

20:26.790 --> 20:29.532
Well, um, I better
catch up with them.

20:29.576 --> 20:32.796
You have a lovely home, Whitney.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.798
I'm sorry,
what was your handle again?

20:34.842 --> 20:36.539
Why, are you gonna give me
a follow back?

20:36.583 --> 20:38.062
Yeah, sure.

20:38.106 --> 20:40.369
Any friend of Lucas'
is a friend of mine.

20:44.808 --> 20:46.723
Oh, you're so funny, Whitney.

20:46.767 --> 20:48.899
I'm so glad we're friends.

20:48.943 --> 20:52.947
You're so pretty,
and your hair's...

20:52.990 --> 20:54.446
Hey, man, you need to chill out,
all right?

20:54.470 --> 20:57.386
- Jesus, relax, man!
- Oh, my God...

20:58.866 --> 21:01.172
I don't ever want to see you
near her again.

21:01.216 --> 21:02.348
You understand me?

21:02.391 --> 21:04.480
Now, get the hell out of here!

21:04.524 --> 21:06.090
Bye, Whitney.

21:07.657 --> 21:10.573
- You okay?
- You're, you're bleeding.

21:12.227 --> 21:13.335
I'm fine. Are you all right?

21:13.359 --> 21:15.012
Yeah, I'm fine.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.191
Should I call the police?

21:20.235 --> 21:23.760
No, no.
He won't be botherin' anyone.

21:23.804 --> 21:25.588
Should I even ask
where you know those moves?

21:25.632 --> 21:26.957
I mean, are you taking, like,
a karate class

21:26.981 --> 21:29.723
at the hardware store?

21:29.766 --> 21:32.247
No, no, I was a...

21:32.291 --> 21:36.251
I was a little bit of a heavier
kid in middle school,

21:36.295 --> 21:39.602
and the girls didn't really pay
that much attention to me,

21:39.646 --> 21:42.779
but the bullies did,
so I, I took some classes,

21:42.823 --> 21:46.305
I learnt some things,
worked out a bit.

21:46.348 --> 21:49.351
- A bit?
- Oh, yeah.

21:49.395 --> 21:51.353
Maybe a little more than a bit.

21:51.397 --> 21:53.747
If I set my mind to something,

21:53.790 --> 21:57.707
I can kinda go
a little overboard.

21:57.751 --> 21:59.796
Well, I'd like to thank
middle-school Mike

21:59.840 --> 22:01.624
for hittin' the weights.

22:01.668 --> 22:03.887
Really came in handy tonight.

22:03.931 --> 22:05.759
Well, I could show you
some things.

22:05.802 --> 22:08.152
Self-defense, I mean.

22:08.196 --> 22:12.156
I don't know. Not sure
if you're really qualified.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.158
Touche.

22:15.769 --> 22:18.467
Okay. Yeah. Let's do one.

22:18.511 --> 22:21.383
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

22:22.819 --> 22:24.343
- Come at me. All right.
- Okay.

22:24.386 --> 22:26.867
So you're gonna use their
momentum against them,

22:26.910 --> 22:29.609
so when you reach out,
reach out.

22:29.652 --> 22:33.221
Grab it, turn it, twist...
Just like that.

22:34.527 --> 22:36.137
Now do it a little faster.

22:36.180 --> 22:38.357
Promise I won't hurt you.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.707
- Ready? Come on.
- Okay.

22:40.750 --> 22:44.537
Grab it, turn it, twist...
And then...

22:44.580 --> 22:45.886
Like that?

22:45.929 --> 22:48.410
Yeah. Yeah, something like that.

22:49.803 --> 22:52.806
I did some self-defense classes
in LA.

22:52.849 --> 22:54.242
I can tell.

22:55.591 --> 22:57.898
- Oh, your nose, it's bleeding.
- Oh.

22:57.941 --> 22:59.552
- Yeah. Sorry.
- Again.

22:59.595 --> 23:01.510
Umm...

23:01.554 --> 23:04.034
Same thing would happen
to middle-school Mike

23:04.078 --> 23:05.819
when he'd try to talk to girls.

23:05.862 --> 23:07.516
Yeah.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.388
It's fine.

23:09.431 --> 23:12.739
Um, I should probably get back
inside though.

23:12.782 --> 23:14.305
Thank you for everything.

23:14.349 --> 23:18.222
Of course.
And thank you, actually.

23:18.266 --> 23:20.921
No, I had a,
I had a wonderful time. Yeah.

23:20.964 --> 23:24.315
I can come help clean up
tomorrow, if you need.

23:24.359 --> 23:27.623
No, you've already done so much
already, seriously.

23:27.667 --> 23:29.625
Then how about dinner?

23:29.669 --> 23:31.975
Or a bottle of wine?

23:32.019 --> 23:34.413
I mean, I may not be able to
live up to your.

23:34.456 --> 23:38.460
LA social-media scene standards,
but...

23:38.504 --> 23:41.289
I don't know, I've got,
I've got some pretty good taste.

23:41.332 --> 23:42.595
I'd like that.

23:42.638 --> 23:44.248
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

23:45.467 --> 23:47.121
- Okay.
- Okay.

23:48.383 --> 23:49.428
Goodnight.

23:49.993 --> 23:51.299
Goodnight.

24:22.417 --> 24:23.679
Oh, I thought...

24:23.723 --> 24:26.508
- It would be Whitney?
- Yeah.

24:26.552 --> 24:28.573
I've done the whole leave-behind
move plenty of times

24:28.597 --> 24:31.078
when I want to see somebody
the next day.

24:32.558 --> 24:34.081
Thanks, I, uh...

24:34.124 --> 24:36.300
You don't need to explain
anything. I get it.

24:36.344 --> 24:37.911
I mean, Whitney's awesome.

24:37.954 --> 24:40.914
Yeah, she's definitely
something.

24:40.957 --> 24:43.873
All right, well, I'm not going
to beat around the bush here.

24:43.917 --> 24:45.614
Whitney means
everything to me, so...

24:45.658 --> 24:48.487
So you wanted to come over and
make sure that I wasn't a jerk?

24:48.530 --> 24:51.794
I was gonna say closet creep,
but...

24:51.838 --> 24:55.885
Seriously, my sister...

24:55.929 --> 24:59.323
Her line of work invites a lot
of strangers into her life.

24:59.367 --> 25:02.196
I mean, she's had to deal with
some legit weirdos.

25:02.239 --> 25:05.504
And she might act like it
doesn't bother her, but it does.

25:05.547 --> 25:09.682
So, I wanna make sure that she's
not gonna get hurt offline.

25:11.074 --> 25:13.120
Well, I won't be hurting anyone.

25:13.163 --> 25:14.687
Well, what about the guy
last night?

25:14.730 --> 25:16.340
Well, you want me to apologize

25:16.384 --> 25:18.865
for protecting your sister?

25:18.908 --> 25:22.129
No. I just want you to make sure
it's not a common occurrence.

25:22.172 --> 25:23.652
I promise you it won't be.

25:25.436 --> 25:28.527
Look, I understand that
you wanna protect your sister.

25:28.570 --> 25:33.662
And if I've done anything
to upset her, or you,

25:33.706 --> 25:35.229
it was not my intention.

25:35.272 --> 25:39.015
You haven't. I'm sorry.

25:39.059 --> 25:42.323
I just want my sister
to be happy.

25:42.366 --> 25:44.281
We can agree on that.

25:45.631 --> 25:46.762
Okay.

26:00.428 --> 26:02.517
Why are you up and about
so early?

26:03.474 --> 26:05.476
Just visiting the neighbors.

26:07.304 --> 26:09.306
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

26:09.350 --> 26:13.093
I w-was returning Mike's jacket
to him...

26:13.136 --> 26:16.575
And we chatted a little bit, and
you might have been brought up.

26:16.618 --> 26:19.534
Please don't tell me you
did the whole sister speech.

26:20.274 --> 26:21.710
Meghan!

26:21.754 --> 26:23.209
What, like,
I'm not goin' to interrogate

26:23.233 --> 26:26.541
the guy you're into?
You know who I am.

26:27.847 --> 26:29.239
I do this out of love.

26:29.283 --> 26:32.852
Plenty of people do awful things
out of love.

26:32.895 --> 26:36.943
Okay, that's a really weird way
of saying thank you,

26:36.986 --> 26:39.554
but I'll take it.

26:42.339 --> 26:45.734
So? What'd you think?

26:48.084 --> 26:50.478
- About Mike?
- Yeah!

26:50.521 --> 26:56.136
I mean, he hasn't done anything
to make me hate him, so...

26:56.179 --> 26:58.878
Wow, that's a glowing
recommendation.

26:58.921 --> 27:03.796
Yeah, but...
I mean, if you like him,

27:03.839 --> 27:05.014
give him a chance.

27:06.102 --> 27:08.496
- Thank you.
- Hmm.

27:10.498 --> 27:11.867
You're kind of annoying
but you're also

27:11.891 --> 27:12.935
a really good sister.

27:12.979 --> 27:14.937
Yeah, I know.

27:14.981 --> 27:16.809
Um, I got to get ready for work.

27:16.852 --> 27:19.725
Um, if Mike does anything weird,
just...

27:19.768 --> 27:21.137
- I will text you immediately.
- You know...

27:21.161 --> 27:23.424
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

28:19.436 --> 28:20.960
Hey, Meghan.

28:21.003 --> 28:23.571
Can I get that, uh, paperwork
for the Cronauer policy?

28:23.614 --> 28:25.660
- I'll have it over in five.
- Okay.

28:43.156 --> 28:46.246
Meghan, you okay over there?

28:46.289 --> 28:47.813
Never better, Stuart.

28:49.597 --> 28:53.949
And I just discovered my new...

28:53.993 --> 28:55.516
Hey, what's up?

28:55.559 --> 28:57.126
Just talked to Lucas' people,

28:57.170 --> 28:59.999
you're on for dinner
tonight at Bistro 5.

29:00.042 --> 29:01.565
Just to make sure,

29:01.609 --> 29:04.307
you are going to say yes
to his proposal?

29:04.351 --> 29:08.877
Tsk. Um,
I don't really know yet.

29:08.921 --> 29:12.315
As your manager, I'm telling
you to take the deal.

29:12.359 --> 29:13.926
As your friend, I'm telling you

29:13.969 --> 29:15.289
to give your manager
a higher cut.

29:17.930 --> 29:21.107
Um, I promise you I will give it
my full consideration.

29:21.150 --> 29:23.979
And, you know, if it feels like
the right move...

29:24.023 --> 29:26.329
It is the right move,
and I trust that

29:26.373 --> 29:28.679
you're gonna make the right
decision for the both of us.

29:28.723 --> 29:30.507
Okay. I'm gonna hang up now.

29:30.551 --> 29:32.248
Wait, hey, before you go,

29:32.292 --> 29:34.816
I reviewed the footage
and it looks good.

29:34.860 --> 29:37.732
Just don't have Meghan hanging
out in the background.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.603
She wasn't there
when I taped it.

29:39.647 --> 29:42.128
Then who was it? You can
see someone in the background.

29:44.565 --> 29:45.784
Hold on.

29:47.089 --> 29:49.265
It's organic, it's gluten free,

29:49.309 --> 29:51.702
and it's a 100% vegan.

29:51.746 --> 29:53.139
This packaging is...

29:56.098 --> 29:59.058
Um, someone's at the door.
I have to go.

29:59.101 --> 30:01.147
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

30:01.190 --> 30:02.452
I'll see you tomorrow.

30:02.496 --> 30:04.411
Okay. Toodles.

30:04.454 --> 30:05.629
Bye.

30:20.688 --> 30:22.128
Hey, I think I have somethin'
for ya.

30:22.168 --> 30:23.691
Thank you.

30:24.823 --> 30:27.347
All right. Have a good day.

30:48.107 --> 30:52.372
Hi. Sorry, I just got out
of the shower.

30:54.417 --> 30:57.986
Right, um, so...
This came to my house,

30:58.030 --> 31:00.162
but it was addressed
to a Kathy Edwards.

31:00.206 --> 31:03.731
- I... Is that...
- Yeah, that's mom.

31:03.774 --> 31:05.037
Oh, okay.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.039
I thought your last name
was Vincent.

31:07.082 --> 31:10.477
It is, uh,
she took my stepdad's last name

31:10.520 --> 31:12.000
when she remarried.

31:12.044 --> 31:13.045
Hmm.

31:15.569 --> 31:16.918
Hi, Kathy!

31:18.267 --> 31:21.792
Yeah, she's just having
one of her off days.

31:21.836 --> 31:23.272
Is she okay?

31:23.316 --> 31:26.058
Yeah.
She just needs her medicine.

31:26.101 --> 31:27.842
Okay, well,
then I'll let you go.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.539
No, you don't have to.

31:29.583 --> 31:32.891
I have a deadline on a video
anyway, so it's fine.

31:34.457 --> 31:37.591
Maybe later this afternoon,
I can swing by

31:37.634 --> 31:38.592
when you're done with work?

31:38.635 --> 31:40.637
Yeah, I'd like that.

31:40.681 --> 31:42.988
Uh, 4 o'clock?

31:43.814 --> 31:44.903
See you then.

31:44.946 --> 31:46.034
See you then.

31:50.517 --> 31:51.866
Mmh.

32:09.536 --> 32:11.799
Wow, you're very punctual.

32:11.842 --> 32:13.453
Yeah, well.

32:13.496 --> 32:14.996
I figure if I get the
chance to see you,

32:15.020 --> 32:17.544
why wait any
longer than necessary?

32:17.587 --> 32:19.415
You look great, by the way.

32:19.459 --> 32:21.113
Thank you. You too.

32:21.156 --> 32:23.419
- Thank you. Shall we?
- Mm-hmm.

32:26.074 --> 32:27.834
I forgot how beautiful
this place is.

32:27.858 --> 32:29.034
Hmm.

32:29.077 --> 32:30.731
I didn't realize
how much I missed it

32:30.774 --> 32:32.385
until I moved back.

32:33.821 --> 32:35.736
I told you I grew up here,
right?

32:35.779 --> 32:38.304
Yeah, yeah.

32:38.347 --> 32:40.610
I already knew that, though.

32:40.654 --> 32:42.525
You did?

32:42.569 --> 32:45.398
What are you,
internet-stalking me?

32:45.441 --> 32:48.053
Maybe.

32:48.096 --> 32:52.187
No, I told you
I'm social media illiterate.

32:54.189 --> 32:56.017
You don't remember me, do you?

32:57.018 --> 32:58.977
We went to high school together.

33:00.456 --> 33:01.936
- We did?
- Hmm.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.504
I'm sorry.

33:04.547 --> 33:06.027
It's okay, it's okay.

33:06.071 --> 33:09.117
We didn't really run in the same
social circles.

33:09.161 --> 33:11.554
You were always so popular.

33:13.426 --> 33:15.950
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

33:15.994 --> 33:18.126
It's embarrassing.

33:18.170 --> 33:20.781
I mean, a small part of me
was hoping

33:20.824 --> 33:23.305
that you'd remember who I was,

33:23.349 --> 33:28.615
but, uh, I was kind
of a geek back then, so...

33:28.658 --> 33:32.184
if you didn't remember
maybe that was a good thing.

33:33.446 --> 33:36.449
Mike, I don't care
about that stuff.

33:36.492 --> 33:40.366
Everybody had
their awkward teen years.

33:41.584 --> 33:43.586
You didn't.

33:43.630 --> 33:46.024
You were always perfect.

33:48.765 --> 33:53.422
If I'm being honest, I kinda had
a huge crush on you back then.

33:54.902 --> 33:56.382
You did?

33:58.601 --> 34:01.822
Can I ask what really brought
you back home?

34:01.865 --> 34:05.695
Honestly, I just needed
to get out of LA.

34:07.306 --> 34:10.960
In my line of work,
it's easy to get sucked into

34:11.005 --> 34:13.746
that whole fake persona.

34:13.790 --> 34:15.159
You know, you can't tell
if people are trying

34:15.183 --> 34:16.402
to actually be your friend,

34:16.445 --> 34:19.231
or if they just
want more followers.

34:19.274 --> 34:24.583
- Hmm.
- But here it's real, you know?

34:27.282 --> 34:30.632
And then my parents...

34:33.245 --> 34:34.637
I don't know, I just felt guilty

34:34.681 --> 34:37.466
that I wasn't here
when they died.

34:37.510 --> 34:41.643
And there was this big part
of me missing here, and...

34:41.688 --> 34:44.777
I felt like
if I didn't come back...

34:44.821 --> 34:47.215
it would just disappear.

34:49.174 --> 34:51.828
I'm sorry, Whitney.

34:51.871 --> 34:54.266
It's okay. I mean,
you know how it feels.

34:55.831 --> 34:59.009
Well, with your mom,
when you moved in with your mom?

34:59.053 --> 35:01.273
Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course.

35:01.316 --> 35:04.537
Um, that was my stepdad, though,

35:04.580 --> 35:07.714
so we weren't really that close.

35:09.933 --> 35:13.415
Sorry, I didn't mean to
bring the mood down.

35:13.459 --> 35:16.853
No, it's okay. It's nice to talk
to someone about this.

35:16.897 --> 35:20.466
Not a lot of people
see this part of me.

35:29.779 --> 35:31.607
Well, here we are.

35:34.436 --> 35:36.482
Do you want to come over?

35:37.352 --> 35:39.354
Oh. No, I shouldn't.

35:39.398 --> 35:41.617
I have to edit a video.

35:42.575 --> 35:45.360
Well, what about later tonight?

35:45.404 --> 35:47.319
Wanna grab some dinner?

35:48.276 --> 35:50.278
I would, I really want to,

35:50.322 --> 35:53.151
but I have this thing
with Lucas tonight.

35:53.194 --> 35:54.804
Lucas?

35:54.848 --> 35:58.591
From the party.
We're doing a collaboration.

35:58.634 --> 36:01.463
I'm trying to figure out
if it's something I wanna do.

36:01.507 --> 36:03.335
- Hmm.
- It's kinda risky.

36:03.378 --> 36:05.337
It'd be the biggest thing
I've ever done though.

36:05.380 --> 36:06.990
And it'd be really good
for my career

36:07.034 --> 36:09.776
so we're just trying to figure
that out over dinner.

36:11.038 --> 36:12.779
Should I be jealous?

36:12.822 --> 36:15.303
No, it's strictly professional.

36:15.347 --> 36:16.522
Hmm, good.

36:16.565 --> 36:17.958
For what it's worth,

36:18.001 --> 36:20.178
I think you should do it.

36:20.221 --> 36:22.005
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

36:22.049 --> 36:26.184
Yeah, the way that you light up
when you're talking about it,

36:26.227 --> 36:27.837
don't overthink it.

36:30.536 --> 36:36.106
Taking, uh, risks
every now and then can pay off.

36:42.025 --> 36:44.202
I'm sorry.

36:44.245 --> 36:45.855
It's okay.

36:45.899 --> 36:49.119
I just...
I like to take things slow.

36:50.382 --> 36:51.600
No, I get it.

36:52.297 --> 36:53.776
I can wait.

36:54.821 --> 36:58.085
- Really? Thank you.
- Hmm.

36:58.128 --> 36:59.869
Have a good night, Whitney.

36:59.913 --> 37:01.131
You too.

37:22.022 --> 37:23.652
Look, at the end
of the day, if you're gonna

37:23.676 --> 37:25.808
harvest bees,
you have to figure out

37:25.852 --> 37:27.810
if you can even fit in that suit
they give you,

37:27.854 --> 37:29.310
I mean, it's ridiculous,
they give you

37:29.334 --> 37:32.815
this big helmet thing,
and... I'll do it.

37:32.859 --> 37:34.817
- Are you serious?
- Yup.

37:34.861 --> 37:37.559
Oh, that's so great!
How did you decide?

37:37.603 --> 37:40.475
Well, I listed all
the pros and cons.

37:40.519 --> 37:42.477
- Like, 5000 times.
- Of course.

37:42.521 --> 37:44.305
And then I thought, "Screw it."

37:44.349 --> 37:47.221
And I threw the list
out of the metaphorical window.

37:47.265 --> 37:48.701
Paper plane.

37:48.744 --> 37:50.833
I just realized that if I want

37:50.877 --> 37:52.487
to take my career seriously,

37:52.531 --> 37:54.272
then I have to put myself
out there.

37:54.315 --> 37:55.447
- You know?
- Yeah.

37:55.490 --> 37:57.405
I wanna get involved

37:57.449 --> 37:59.059
in causes, and products

37:59.102 --> 38:02.541
that I actually believe in,
and use my platform

38:02.584 --> 38:04.412
that I'm so lucky to even have.

38:04.456 --> 38:05.805
Wow.

38:05.848 --> 38:07.546
I can't be afraid of success.

38:07.589 --> 38:09.069
Umm. You said it best.

38:09.112 --> 38:10.612
I couldn't say it any better
than that.

38:10.636 --> 38:13.073
We got to celebrate
at this point.

38:13.116 --> 38:15.684
Hey, uh, can I just get two
glasses of champagne, please?

38:15.728 --> 38:17.947
Thank you.

38:17.991 --> 38:19.775
Wait,
I thought you didn't drink.

38:19.819 --> 38:21.864
Um, one's not gonna kill me,
right?

38:30.786 --> 38:32.503
I got-I got to get fans
'cause this...

38:32.527 --> 38:34.137
- Okay.
- Days like today.

38:34.181 --> 38:36.662
We got to get this.

38:36.705 --> 38:38.490
What's up, guys,
we're out here at Bistro 5

38:38.533 --> 38:42.232
having a fantastic dinner with
this lovely lady right here.

38:42.276 --> 38:43.949
We got some really exciting news
coming for you guys

38:43.973 --> 38:46.802
over the next few days,
but we cannot say anything yet.

38:46.846 --> 38:49.805
So, in the meantime,
follow @lovewhitney

38:49.849 --> 38:52.373
on everything,
I promise you guys

38:52.417 --> 38:53.766
you will not be disappointed.

38:53.809 --> 38:55.483
You're gonna love this girl
as much as I do.

38:55.507 --> 38:57.160
Oh.

38:57.204 --> 38:58.379
Ooh...

39:07.910 --> 39:09.497
We got some really exciting
news coming for you guys

39:09.521 --> 39:12.654
over the next few days,
but we cannot say anything yet.

39:12.698 --> 39:15.527
So, in the meantime,
follow @lovewhitney

39:15.570 --> 39:18.399
on everything,
I promise you guys

39:18.443 --> 39:20.270
you will not be disappointed.

40:07.492 --> 40:10.712
Follow back.

40:24.160 --> 40:25.335
Hey.

40:26.336 --> 40:27.337
What's wrong?

40:28.295 --> 40:30.079
You didn't hear?

40:32.691 --> 40:34.997
Oh, my God.

40:35.041 --> 40:37.260
I was just with him last night.

40:37.304 --> 40:38.218
I know.

40:38.261 --> 40:39.828
Uh, according to the article,

40:39.872 --> 40:41.090
his blood-alcohol level

40:41.134 --> 40:44.180
was nearly three times
the limit.

40:44.224 --> 40:46.182
What? No, that's impossible!

40:46.226 --> 40:48.881
He had one glass of champagne.

40:48.924 --> 40:50.926
Well, that's not it.

40:53.842 --> 40:55.235
I mean, that's him, right?

40:55.278 --> 40:58.934
That's the guy that's been
harassing you?

41:00.545 --> 41:02.218
You don't think it's kind
of a coincidence?

41:02.242 --> 41:04.244
Your stalker's venting
on Lucas' page

41:04.287 --> 41:06.942
and then Lucas dies
the next morning?

41:07.769 --> 41:09.075
You can't be serious.

41:09.118 --> 41:10.772
I mean, he told us
he didn't drink.

41:10.816 --> 41:14.428
Right? Think about it.

41:14.472 --> 41:17.518
There's someone at the party,
someone doesn't like Lucas,

41:17.562 --> 41:19.651
someone didn't know that Lucas
doesn't drink...

41:19.694 --> 41:22.610
What are you saying?

41:22.654 --> 41:24.612
Did you tell Mike
you went to dinner with Lucas?

41:26.353 --> 41:28.442
Wow, you've lost your mind.

41:28.486 --> 41:29.680
You're not answering
the question.

41:29.704 --> 41:30.966
Yes. I did.

41:31.010 --> 41:32.664
I told him
I was going to dinner.

41:32.707 --> 41:34.404
And he encouraged me.

41:34.448 --> 41:37.582
And now you think that Mike
force-fed Lucas alcohol

41:37.625 --> 41:39.540
and set up some crazy
car accident?

41:39.584 --> 41:41.977
No, no, I just mean...

41:42.021 --> 41:44.284
how well do you really
know Mike?

41:44.327 --> 41:46.939
He has a flip phone, Meghan!

41:46.982 --> 41:49.202
How would he even do that?

41:49.245 --> 41:50.832
- God, this is ridiculous.
- Is it?

41:50.856 --> 41:52.161
I mean, you move next door,

41:52.205 --> 41:54.903
and your stalker situation
gets worse?

41:54.947 --> 41:56.731
- What about Greg?
- I don't know.

41:56.775 --> 41:57.993
I don't know about Greg.

41:58.037 --> 41:58.994
I haven't seen him
since the party.

41:59.038 --> 42:00.735
But Mike, I mean, you guys have

42:00.779 --> 42:05.000
gotten pretty close, and he was,
he was reallyinto you.

42:05.044 --> 42:06.262
When you guys first met.

42:06.306 --> 42:07.350
So what?

42:07.394 --> 42:08.351
And, by the way, Mike didn't

42:08.395 --> 42:11.006
just come out of nowhere.

42:11.050 --> 42:13.356
We actually went
to high school together.

42:13.400 --> 42:15.620
- He said he had a crush on me.
- Wait, what?

42:15.663 --> 42:17.709
You know this makes him
a bigger suspect, right?

42:17.752 --> 42:20.712
A suspect for what?

42:20.755 --> 42:23.453
It was an accident. It literally
says it right there.

42:25.238 --> 42:29.547
Meg... I know you're just trying
to protect me,

42:29.590 --> 42:32.419
and I really appreciate that...

42:32.462 --> 42:33.744
but you have to
listen to yourself.

42:33.768 --> 42:35.465
You sound crazy.

42:36.989 --> 42:40.775
Mike's the first guy I've liked
in a really long time.

42:40.819 --> 42:43.256
He likes me.

42:43.299 --> 42:46.607
Not just the number of followers
or posts or photoshoots,

42:46.651 --> 42:48.957
he likes me for me.

42:49.001 --> 42:52.352
And now all this, what,
because you have a bad feeling?

42:54.006 --> 42:56.095
Okay, I'm sorry.

42:56.138 --> 42:57.792
It's fine. Just...

42:57.836 --> 42:59.596
Please don't jump
to conclusions about people

42:59.620 --> 43:01.666
until you have actual proof.

43:02.841 --> 43:03.841
Okay.

43:32.697 --> 43:33.654
Hey.

43:33.698 --> 43:35.395
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

43:35.438 --> 43:37.484
Sorry.

43:37.527 --> 43:41.140
I just, uh, got some bad news
this morning.

43:41.183 --> 43:44.056
Anything I can do to help?

43:44.099 --> 43:46.101
No. Thank you though.

43:46.145 --> 43:48.800
I think I just need to process.

43:48.843 --> 43:51.803
- Okay.
- What's up?

43:51.846 --> 43:54.370
Just wanted to see
if you're free.

43:54.414 --> 43:57.896
If you wanna
get something to eat.

43:57.939 --> 44:01.508
Um, but, I-I-I can
leave you be if you need...

44:01.551 --> 44:05.251
No, you know what?
I could actually use a bite.

44:05.294 --> 44:06.513
- Yeah? You sure?
- Yeah.

44:06.556 --> 44:08.646
I think it's exactly
what I need.

44:08.689 --> 44:09.689
Okay.

44:11.126 --> 44:12.258
All right.

44:12.301 --> 44:13.563
Let's go.

44:17.045 --> 44:18.045
Morning, Susan.

44:30.102 --> 44:33.453
Okay, Whitney, you want proof?
I'll get you proof.

44:44.769 --> 44:46.771
The article said
that his blood alcohol level

44:46.814 --> 44:48.729
was three times
over the legal limit.

44:48.773 --> 44:50.992
It just, it doesn't make sense.

44:51.036 --> 44:52.733
That's awful.

44:52.777 --> 44:54.517
I'm sorry.

44:54.561 --> 44:55.712
I just never would've guessed
that Lucas would

44:55.736 --> 44:58.565
do something like that.

44:58.608 --> 45:03.004
He just didn't seem so...
reckless.

45:03.048 --> 45:04.919
- Hm.
- Sad.

45:07.095 --> 45:09.707
But it also gets me angry
because it's not just his life

45:09.750 --> 45:12.231
that he puts in to danger.

45:12.274 --> 45:17.149
My parents...
were killed in a hit and run.

45:17.192 --> 45:20.979
And the police said that it was
probably a drunk driver.

45:21.022 --> 45:23.590
Somebody like Lucas who just
made one bad decision

45:23.633 --> 45:25.723
and... that's it.

45:27.986 --> 45:29.465
That's terrible.

45:36.342 --> 45:37.386
Bingo.

46:23.737 --> 46:25.695
Hey, creep.

46:25.739 --> 46:28.568
Remember me?

46:28.611 --> 46:29.656
What do you want?

46:29.699 --> 46:31.136
I have a suspicion,

46:31.179 --> 46:33.355
and I'm hoping
you could help me out.

46:33.399 --> 46:35.401
The other night, at the party...

46:35.444 --> 46:37.882
why'd you sneak in?

46:37.925 --> 46:39.753
I mean, if you were
trespassing...

46:39.797 --> 46:42.582
Look, I wasn't
trespassing, okay?

46:42.625 --> 46:46.760
- I was... invited there.
- By who?

46:46.804 --> 46:48.980
- Certainly not my sister.
- No.

46:51.112 --> 46:54.202
Greg, you have to give me
something.

46:54.246 --> 46:57.249
Unless you want assault charges
filed against you, um...

46:57.292 --> 46:59.642
Fine.

46:59.686 --> 47:02.994
Somebody paid me to go...
to cause a scene.

47:03.037 --> 47:06.127
- Who?
- Honestly, I don't know.

47:06.171 --> 47:08.956
We spoke through DMs, the money
was sent electronically.

47:09.000 --> 47:12.960
- What was their handle?
- "Whitneybigfan."

47:13.004 --> 47:14.546
All I know is they seemed
really interested

47:14.570 --> 47:16.311
in giving Whitney a scare.

47:16.355 --> 47:18.376
Which is weird, because based
on their posting history,

47:18.400 --> 47:20.272
they're crazy about her.

47:21.186 --> 47:22.840
Look, I...

47:22.883 --> 47:25.277
I didn't mean for it
to go that far.

47:25.320 --> 47:27.845
I wouldn't have come.

47:33.415 --> 47:35.635
Whitney? Shit!

47:35.678 --> 47:36.854
Whit?

47:42.598 --> 47:44.774
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on, come on.

47:56.612 --> 47:57.787
Mike.

48:08.929 --> 48:13.020
Sorry. I set an alarm
for my mom's medication.

48:13.064 --> 48:15.762
If I don't keep
to the schedule, she...

48:15.805 --> 48:18.330
kinda gets a little antsy.

48:18.373 --> 48:19.809
Should we go?

48:19.853 --> 48:22.682
No, no, I've,
I've got like an hour.

48:22.725 --> 48:25.250
Um, I don't wanna end this

48:25.293 --> 48:28.035
a second earlier than I have to.

48:40.482 --> 48:42.354
Mike, are you in there?

48:48.969 --> 48:51.537
Do you mind if I ask you
what happened?

48:51.580 --> 48:54.018
To my mom? No.

48:55.454 --> 48:57.978
So, when my stepdad died,

48:58.022 --> 49:00.459
um, she just kinda...

49:01.721 --> 49:03.723
lost it.

49:03.766 --> 49:06.247
And now I've got to give her
these injections every few hours

49:06.291 --> 49:10.338
to help keep her anxiety
in check.

49:10.382 --> 49:14.908
Is that why she's kinda like...

49:14.952 --> 49:17.215
A zombie? Yeah.

49:17.258 --> 49:21.175
The medicine helps
but... it also

49:21.219 --> 49:23.743
keeps her pretty quiet.

49:23.786 --> 49:25.658
She doesn't say much anymore.

49:27.616 --> 49:28.704
I'm sorry.

49:29.618 --> 49:30.619
Thank you.

49:33.274 --> 49:35.320
Well, then you should
probably go.

49:37.061 --> 49:39.367
You know what,
when we get back, we can

49:39.411 --> 49:41.326
keep hanging out.

49:41.369 --> 49:43.110
I'd like that.

49:53.860 --> 49:54.992
Kathy?

51:05.018 --> 51:06.889
What are you hiding in there?

51:08.152 --> 51:11.329
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

51:11.372 --> 51:14.984
I mean, since the incident,
it's just been me around really.

51:15.028 --> 51:18.118
You know, she gets pretty
anxious around other people

51:18.162 --> 51:21.165
but... I think she's gonna
like you.

51:31.175 --> 51:33.133
- What's going on?
- Help!

51:33.177 --> 51:34.482
- Oh.
- Help.

51:34.526 --> 51:37.224
- What did you do to her?
- Help me!

51:37.268 --> 51:39.096
Mom, it's okay.

51:39.139 --> 51:40.662
- What are you doing here?
- I...

51:40.706 --> 51:43.274
Sorry. I saw Kathy
through the window.

51:43.317 --> 51:45.145
Um, and nobody was home, so...

51:45.189 --> 51:46.625
I think she's saying help.

51:46.668 --> 51:47.863
Yeah, of course,
she's saying help.

51:47.887 --> 51:49.715
She's having a panic attack.

51:51.630 --> 51:52.892
It's okay.

52:03.337 --> 52:06.775
That was crazy.zy.

52:06.819 --> 52:10.475
I'm glad we got here in time.

52:10.518 --> 52:12.390
Thank you, by the way,

52:12.433 --> 52:14.566
for being there for Kathy.

52:14.609 --> 52:17.786
I know you have your
suspicions about Mike.

52:19.397 --> 52:21.225
Yeah, about that.

52:21.268 --> 52:24.402
Uh... what I was saying earlier

52:24.445 --> 52:27.144
about seeing Kathy
through the window,

52:27.187 --> 52:28.928
it wasn't exactly true.

52:28.971 --> 52:30.756
What?

52:30.799 --> 52:33.454
Okay, don't freak out, but
I managed to track down the guy

52:33.498 --> 52:34.412
who attacked you at the party.

52:34.455 --> 52:36.196
- Greg.
- Meg!

52:36.240 --> 52:38.981
What? I'm not gonna apologize
for looking into a stalker.

52:40.026 --> 52:41.984
Anyway...

52:42.028 --> 52:45.771
he said he was hired by someone
to go to the party.

52:45.814 --> 52:48.208
To scare you.

52:48.252 --> 52:50.384
- Do you know who it was?
- Who?

52:50.428 --> 52:52.343
Whitneybigfan.

52:52.386 --> 52:54.823
You are not saying
what I think you're saying.

52:54.867 --> 52:58.958
Whit, who else has come
in to your life recently?

52:59.001 --> 53:01.656
Lucas? Oh. Right.

53:01.700 --> 53:03.919
He died under mysterious
circumstances.

53:03.963 --> 53:05.225
Stop it!

53:05.269 --> 53:07.923
I... wanted to prove it to you,

53:07.967 --> 53:12.319
so I kind of... broke in.

53:12.363 --> 53:15.148
And that's how I found Kathy.

53:15.192 --> 53:16.889
You said you were gonna drop it.

53:16.932 --> 53:18.212
You said you were gonna
trust me.

53:18.238 --> 53:20.719
I do trust you!

53:20.762 --> 53:22.721
It's him I don't trust.

53:22.764 --> 53:24.636
I don't think Mike
is this great guy

53:24.679 --> 53:26.290
you've been
making him out to be.

53:26.333 --> 53:28.205
Meg, stop.

53:28.248 --> 53:31.164
I-I looked him up
in your yearbook

53:31.208 --> 53:33.471
and the way he's looking at you

53:33.514 --> 53:35.124
in this one picture,

53:35.168 --> 53:37.562
I, I don't think
this is a recent obsession.

53:37.605 --> 53:39.433
Do you know
how crazy this sounds?

53:39.477 --> 53:42.741
I know it sounds crazy.
All of this is crazy.

53:42.784 --> 53:47.485
But there's something... wrong
that's going on here.

53:47.528 --> 53:50.096
- Why can't you see that?
- I said stop!

53:52.968 --> 53:56.407
Sorry, am I interrupting
something?

53:56.450 --> 53:58.626
No. No, nothing.

53:58.670 --> 53:59.888
How's your mom?

53:59.932 --> 54:01.673
Oh, she'll be fine.
She'll be fine.

54:01.716 --> 54:03.501
I just put her to bed and...

54:03.544 --> 54:07.200
she just had, uh,
quite the scare.

54:07.244 --> 54:10.769
Yeah, well, I'm sure
something startled her.

54:12.684 --> 54:15.382
I'm so sorry about all this.

54:15.426 --> 54:17.384
Is there anything we can
do to help?

54:17.428 --> 54:19.778
No. I don't think so. I...

54:19.821 --> 54:22.128
She just needs to rest.

54:22.171 --> 54:23.651
Whitney.

54:23.695 --> 54:25.615
- You can go home.
- I don't think this is a g...

54:25.653 --> 54:28.003
I'll be fine.

54:28.047 --> 54:29.048
Okay.

54:39.145 --> 54:42.366
So, red or white?

54:42.409 --> 54:43.758
It must be hard being

54:43.802 --> 54:45.978
so accessible
to everyone all the time.

54:46.021 --> 54:48.981
People commenting on every
decision you make.

54:49.024 --> 54:51.984
Most of the time, I'm just
putting on a show, you know?

54:53.594 --> 54:56.118
I don't think people
really know the real me.

54:57.816 --> 55:00.993
And the worst part is when some
of my followers

55:01.036 --> 55:04.649
message me disrespectful
and gross things,

55:04.692 --> 55:06.868
and some of them are
actually really scary.

55:07.913 --> 55:10.002
There is this one guy in LA

55:10.045 --> 55:14.049
who started messaging me a lot,

55:14.093 --> 55:16.530
and I didn't really think
much of it at first

55:16.574 --> 55:20.926
but then he started
to get more... personal.

55:20.969 --> 55:23.276
Like that he could see me

55:23.320 --> 55:25.365
and he was watching me.

55:25.409 --> 55:26.627
Did you call the police?

55:26.671 --> 55:29.021
Yeah, when he messaged

55:29.064 --> 55:32.241
pictures of me in my apartment.

55:32.285 --> 55:36.071
But we couldn't get any
information on this guy.

55:36.115 --> 55:37.397
And then, in the middle
of all this,

55:37.421 --> 55:38.857
my parents...

55:41.163 --> 55:44.166
I just, I couldn't
stay there anymore.

55:44.210 --> 55:46.212
I just wanted
to feel safe again.

55:47.866 --> 55:50.390
So you came home.

55:50.434 --> 55:51.652
Yeah.

55:51.696 --> 55:54.438
But then the day I moved back,

55:54.481 --> 55:56.178
someone new started messaging me

55:56.222 --> 55:59.225
and I felt like I was just
starting all over again.

55:59.268 --> 56:01.706
Isn't that crazy?

56:01.749 --> 56:03.098
I mean it's not hard to imagine

56:03.142 --> 56:06.058
why someone would be
so interested in you.

56:09.104 --> 56:11.063
You know, if you need anything

56:11.106 --> 56:13.152
I'm just across the street.

56:14.283 --> 56:15.502
Thanks, Mike.

56:17.330 --> 56:19.376
Just trying
to be a good neighbor.

56:26.034 --> 56:28.080
Is that all you're trying to be?

56:40.048 --> 56:42.137
I can be whatever you need.

56:55.194 --> 56:58.153
Uh... I'm sorry.

56:58.197 --> 56:59.807
- It's fine.
- Uh, let me...

56:59.851 --> 57:03.158
Okay, um, uh, where was your
bathroom again?

57:03.202 --> 57:05.117
- Down the hall to the left.
- Okay.

57:05.160 --> 57:06.074
- Um... It's fine.
- I'm sorry.

57:06.118 --> 57:08.076
I'll be right back.

57:25.485 --> 57:26.549
Hey.

57:26.573 --> 57:27.922
Hey.

57:27.966 --> 57:29.291
Here's a shirt if you need it.

57:29.315 --> 57:31.099
- Oh, thank you.
- Mm-hm.

57:31.143 --> 57:32.729
- I'll be out in a minute.
- Okay.

58:02.174 --> 58:04.742
Ah. Looks better on you than me.

58:04.785 --> 58:06.657
Not surprising.

58:09.573 --> 58:11.879
Your towel.

58:11.923 --> 58:13.533
I totally meant
to get that back to you.

58:13.577 --> 58:14.969
I'm, I'm sorry.

58:15.013 --> 58:17.798
Um, why do you have it?

58:17.842 --> 58:20.801
The party. Uh, fixing the sink.

58:20.845 --> 58:23.456
Th-there was a mess
initially and...

58:23.500 --> 58:26.241
I wanted to bring the towel
back here to wash it

58:26.285 --> 58:29.506
a-and it must've fallen in
with the rest of my laundry.

58:29.549 --> 58:31.464
I'm sorry.

58:31.508 --> 58:33.814
Oh. Yeah. No, that makes sense.

58:33.858 --> 58:36.077
First the wine,
then the towel...

58:36.121 --> 58:38.776
You can see why dating
doesn't really go

58:38.819 --> 58:40.212
that well for me.

58:40.255 --> 58:42.736
You didn't do anything wrong.
Really.

58:45.260 --> 58:48.220
Uh, I've had a little bit
too much to drink,

58:48.263 --> 58:50.352
so I'm just, I'm gonna go home.

58:50.396 --> 58:52.441
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hm.

58:54.705 --> 58:56.794
Okay.

58:56.837 --> 58:59.710
- I'll walk you out.
- Okay.

59:14.420 --> 59:15.420
Hey.

59:22.123 --> 59:23.777
I'm still mad at you.

59:23.821 --> 59:26.911
I'm sorry. Okay?

59:26.954 --> 59:29.914
I just got
a little carried away.

59:29.957 --> 59:31.959
I mean, with everything
that's been going on,

59:32.003 --> 59:34.658
can you really blame me?

59:34.701 --> 59:35.833
It's just...

59:37.617 --> 59:41.012
Okay, I'm the one that convinced
you to move back home.

59:41.055 --> 59:44.885
So I feel... responsible
or something.

59:47.366 --> 59:50.021
Plus... I mean,

59:50.064 --> 59:53.285
I mean, ever since mom and dad
died,

59:53.328 --> 59:57.376
Whit, you're the only person
I care about anymore.

59:57.419 --> 01:00:01.989
So... yeah, maybe I got
a little overprotective.

01:00:02.033 --> 01:00:05.427
I know you mean well but I can
take care of myself, Meg.

01:00:05.471 --> 01:00:08.648
I know you can but that doesn't
mean I'm not going to worry.

01:00:08.692 --> 01:00:12.739
I am the big sister. I'm the one
who's supposed to worry.

01:00:12.783 --> 01:00:14.915
And take care of you.

01:00:14.959 --> 01:00:17.439
So, on that note,

01:00:17.483 --> 01:00:20.704
did you happen to see my phone
at Mike's house?

01:00:20.747 --> 01:00:25.012
No. But I'll just
get it from him tomorrow.

01:00:25.056 --> 01:00:27.319
Okay. Thank you.

01:00:27.362 --> 01:00:30.583
So, are you gonna
lay off of him now?

01:00:33.934 --> 01:00:35.240
Thank you.

01:00:35.283 --> 01:00:36.696
This doesn't mean
I'm happy about it.

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:39.592
I feel like if I don't
take a chance,

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:42.943
then I'm not gonna let anyone
get close to me.

01:00:45.032 --> 01:00:46.817
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:48.645
- Okay.
- Goodnight.

01:00:48.688 --> 01:00:49.688
Goodnight.

01:00:51.169 --> 01:00:53.040
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

01:01:00.178 --> 01:01:02.659
Sorry, Whit.

01:01:07.185 --> 01:01:08.795
Sounds like quite a night.

01:01:08.839 --> 01:01:11.450
Yeah. You could say that.

01:01:13.234 --> 01:01:14.801
I know it seems like a stretch

01:01:14.845 --> 01:01:16.977
but do you think
that there's any truth

01:01:17.021 --> 01:01:18.370
to what Meghan's saying?

01:01:18.413 --> 01:01:21.373
- About another stalker?
- Yeah.

01:01:21.416 --> 01:01:23.288
I mean, you've seen
Whitneybigfan's post.

01:01:23.331 --> 01:01:25.812
They're disturbing, right?

01:01:25.856 --> 01:01:27.727
I mean, I see a lot
of disturbing posts

01:01:27.771 --> 01:01:29.686
on my clients' social media.

01:01:29.729 --> 01:01:32.297
It comes with being
an internet celebrity.

01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:34.386
Can we just find out
who this person is?

01:01:34.429 --> 01:01:36.867
Just in case.

01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:38.607
Likely not.

01:01:38.651 --> 01:01:41.436
But I'll look into it.

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.090
For now,
can I show you something?

01:01:43.134 --> 01:01:45.049
Let me see your phone.

01:01:48.356 --> 01:01:51.577
Someone like Whitneybigfan?

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:54.928
This is all the power
they have right here.

01:01:57.017 --> 01:01:58.453
He's nothing.

01:02:00.281 --> 01:02:04.503
Do yourself a favor and just
take a break for a while.

01:02:04.546 --> 01:02:06.592
See what it's like
to regain control.

01:02:08.899 --> 01:02:12.859
Um, I know that this isn't
tactful at the moment

01:02:12.903 --> 01:02:15.732
but any chance that we're still
on for that photo shoot?

01:02:17.516 --> 01:02:19.823
Yeah. Of course.

01:02:19.866 --> 01:02:21.128
Thank you.

01:02:34.925 --> 01:02:36.187
Wonderful.

01:02:39.451 --> 01:02:43.498
Can you turn your head a little
bit more to the side? A tilt?

01:02:43.542 --> 01:02:45.457
Yeah, like when you play
with your ear ring.

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:49.113
And a little bit more smolder.
Excellent.

01:02:49.156 --> 01:02:51.202
It should just about do it.
Thank you, Marcus.

01:02:55.075 --> 01:02:58.775
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

01:02:58.818 --> 01:03:00.777
Honey, I know
this little thing with Lucas

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:02.866
has you really shaken up.

01:03:02.909 --> 01:03:04.693
It's terrible what happened,

01:03:04.737 --> 01:03:08.785
but... we need to keep
our eyes on the prize.

01:03:08.828 --> 01:03:11.526
I just heard from H2Almond,
and they're still interested

01:03:11.570 --> 01:03:13.833
in you being part
of their campaign.

01:03:13.877 --> 01:03:15.835
I'm sorry, I just really
don't feel like talking

01:03:15.879 --> 01:03:17.315
about this right now.

01:03:17.358 --> 01:03:18.838
Okay, I get it.

01:03:18.882 --> 01:03:20.322
Well, I'm here
for a couple more days

01:03:20.361 --> 01:03:23.321
before heading back to LA
if you need anything.

01:03:23.364 --> 01:03:25.845
Um, how about you go upstairs,
get changed, take a bath,

01:03:25.889 --> 01:03:28.587
relax, and I'll finish up here?

01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:29.806
Okay.

01:03:46.387 --> 01:03:48.868
You're hard at work, I see.

01:03:48.912 --> 01:03:50.914
What're you lookin' up?
Old case files?

01:03:50.957 --> 01:03:53.133
- What?
- Henry Edwards.

01:03:53.177 --> 01:03:56.136
He was one
of our oldest clients.

01:03:56.180 --> 01:04:00.532
- Oh, he was?
- Yeah. Life insurance policy.

01:04:00.575 --> 01:04:02.839
Tragic what happened
but, you know,

01:04:02.882 --> 01:04:05.189
his wife got a huge payout.

01:04:05.232 --> 01:04:07.800
- Did you know his wife Kathy?
- Yeah.

01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:11.630
Sweet woman. Salt of the earth.

01:04:11.673 --> 01:04:13.675
You don't... happen to know

01:04:13.719 --> 01:04:15.895
anything about their son,
Mike, do you?

01:04:15.939 --> 01:04:18.855
Son? No, they didn't
have any kids.

01:04:20.769 --> 01:04:22.597
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

01:04:22.641 --> 01:04:24.208
I knew them for a long time.

01:04:24.251 --> 01:04:26.427
Besides, I would like to think
that Henry would've

01:04:26.471 --> 01:04:28.908
left some money aside
from his policy for a kid

01:04:28.952 --> 01:04:31.041
if he had one.

01:04:31.084 --> 01:04:33.826
So, I'm gonna grab some lunch.
Can I get you something?

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:35.306
No. Thanks.

01:05:36.976 --> 01:05:38.345
Hi, you've reached Whitney.

01:05:38.369 --> 01:05:39.781
Leave a message
and I'll hit you back.

01:05:39.805 --> 01:05:42.155
Hey, Whit, it's Meg.

01:05:42.199 --> 01:05:43.940
Sorry, I had to call
from the office line.

01:05:43.983 --> 01:05:45.308
Look, I-I know
you don't wanna hear this

01:05:45.332 --> 01:05:47.508
but we really need to talk
about Mike.

01:05:47.552 --> 01:05:48.727
He's not Kathy's son.

01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:50.033
I'm sending you an article

01:05:50.076 --> 01:05:50.990
right now with some information.

01:05:51.034 --> 01:05:53.079
Just please read it.

01:05:55.473 --> 01:05:58.171
Thanks for being
such a trooper today.

01:06:00.043 --> 01:06:02.175
Gotta give the people
what they want, right?

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.005
Spoken like a true influencer.

01:06:08.094 --> 01:06:10.488
Do you want me to come in?

01:06:10.531 --> 01:06:12.446
No, it's okay. Thanks.

01:06:13.621 --> 01:06:15.580
Okay. Hugs.

01:06:18.148 --> 01:06:20.498
Uh, get home safe.

01:06:20.541 --> 01:06:22.239
I will.

01:06:22.282 --> 01:06:25.024
And you be safe, too, okay?

01:06:25.068 --> 01:06:26.504
I will.

01:06:45.044 --> 01:06:47.394
Hey, Whit, it's Meg.

01:06:47.438 --> 01:06:49.788
Hey, Stuart,
did I miss any calls?

01:06:49.831 --> 01:06:51.268
- Nope.
- All right.

01:06:51.311 --> 01:06:53.009
I'm gonna take off
for the night.

01:06:53.052 --> 01:06:55.054
Okay. See you tomorrow.

01:07:12.811 --> 01:07:14.397
Sending you an article right now

01:07:14.421 --> 01:07:17.033
with some information.
Just please read it.

01:07:17.076 --> 01:07:18.227
We'll talk
when I get home tonight

01:07:18.251 --> 01:07:20.079
but until then please,

01:07:20.123 --> 01:07:22.603
please stay away from Mike.

01:07:22.647 --> 01:07:23.647
Okay.

01:07:32.135 --> 01:07:33.092
You've reached Meghan.

01:07:33.136 --> 01:07:34.136
You know what to do.

01:07:35.573 --> 01:07:38.054
Hey, Meg. Is everything okay?

01:07:38.097 --> 01:07:40.491
I just got your message.

01:07:40.534 --> 01:07:43.407
But you don't have your phone
with you.

01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:45.670
Okay, I'm gonna try you
at the office.

01:07:45.713 --> 01:07:47.759
I just, I hope
everything's okay.

01:08:01.164 --> 01:08:03.731
Hey there, superstar.
You doing okay?

01:08:03.775 --> 01:08:06.430
Honestly, I'm just kinda
freaking out.

01:08:06.473 --> 01:08:09.041
I think Meghan's in trouble.

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:10.651
- Wait. What happened?
- I don't know.

01:08:10.695 --> 01:08:13.480
She just left me this
bizarre message about Mike,

01:08:13.524 --> 01:08:15.324
and I can't get a hold
of her and she supposed

01:08:15.352 --> 01:08:17.136
to be home from work by now.

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:19.006
And she's not
answering her cellphone?

01:08:19.051 --> 01:08:21.140
She doesn't even
have her cellphone.

01:08:21.184 --> 01:08:24.055
She left it at Mike's house.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.580
- You don't think that...
- I don't know what I think!

01:08:26.624 --> 01:08:30.106
I'm just, I'm worried about her
and I don't know what to do.

01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:33.587
Well, y-you don't know for sure
that anything's wrong.

01:08:33.631 --> 01:08:35.546
All right.

01:08:35.589 --> 01:08:38.069
I'll be over and then we can
talk this through.

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:39.376
No, I can't wait.

01:08:39.419 --> 01:08:41.377
If she's in trouble,

01:08:41.421 --> 01:08:44.381
I don't wanna be too late.

01:08:44.424 --> 01:08:47.122
No, no, no, Whitney, please
don't do anything drastic.

01:08:47.166 --> 01:08:50.126
I'll be there soon, okay?

01:08:50.169 --> 01:08:53.085
- Okay.
- Hang tight, Whit.

01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:54.956
I'm sure everything
will be fine.

01:10:21.086 --> 01:10:22.086
Kathy?

01:10:42.194 --> 01:10:43.194
Kathy?

01:11:10.962 --> 01:11:12.833
Kathy!

01:11:12.877 --> 01:11:14.661
- Oh, my God! Are you okay?
- No, help!

01:11:14.705 --> 01:11:16.315
- Help me, please!
- I'm gonna help you.

01:11:16.359 --> 01:11:17.490
I promise, okay?

01:11:17.534 --> 01:11:20.363
He'll, he'll... mur-mur...

01:11:20.406 --> 01:11:22.626
Murderer. Murderer.

01:11:22.669 --> 01:11:25.150
Oh, help! Help me!

01:11:25.193 --> 01:11:26.519
- He'll murder me...
- He's not your son, is he?

01:11:26.543 --> 01:11:28.806
No! He's not...

01:11:49.435 --> 01:11:50.610
Meghan?

01:12:35.525 --> 01:12:36.830
Hey, guys, so,

01:12:36.874 --> 01:12:38.832
as you know, I love my products.

01:12:38.876 --> 01:12:42.009
And I just discovered
my new favorite lip whip.

01:12:42.053 --> 01:12:43.489
It's called True Moringa.

01:12:43.533 --> 01:12:45.056
It's organic, it's gluten-free,

01:12:45.099 --> 01:12:46.927
and it's a 100% vegan.

01:12:46.971 --> 01:12:49.756
Oh, this packaging is so cute!

01:12:52.063 --> 01:12:54.892
It's a perfect way to add
a little pop to your day.

01:12:57.242 --> 01:13:00.898
Hey, guys. So, as you know,
I love my products.

01:13:00.941 --> 01:13:04.031
And I just discovered
my new favorite lip whip.

01:13:04.075 --> 01:13:05.468
It's called True Moringa.

01:13:05.511 --> 01:13:07.426
It's organic, it's gluten-free,

01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:09.210
and it's a 100% vegan.

01:13:09.254 --> 01:13:11.909
Oh, this packaging is so cute!

01:13:14.346 --> 01:13:16.870
It's a perfect way to add
a little pop to your day.

01:13:25.226 --> 01:13:27.794
Help! Help!

01:13:27.838 --> 01:13:29.013
Meg.

01:13:31.537 --> 01:13:33.234
- Help!
- Meg...

01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:36.020
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

01:13:38.457 --> 01:13:40.198
Oh, look out!

01:13:41.199 --> 01:13:43.288
You shouldn't be down here.

01:13:45.246 --> 01:13:48.685
Mike, what the hell is going on?

01:13:48.728 --> 01:13:51.949
Everything was going fine.

01:13:51.992 --> 01:13:56.170
We were finally connecting
after so many... years.

01:13:58.738 --> 01:14:01.480
Why are you doing this?

01:14:01.524 --> 01:14:03.482
Isn't it obvious, Whitney?

01:14:03.526 --> 01:14:05.310
We belong together.

01:14:06.703 --> 01:14:09.053
We always have.

01:14:09.096 --> 01:14:11.490
I knew it back
in high school and...

01:14:11.534 --> 01:14:13.666
Even when you left,
I never lost hope.

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:19.629
Do you have any idea
what it's like

01:14:19.672 --> 01:14:23.415
having to watch your soulmate
from afar for so long?

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:26.984
Seeing other men
commenting on her photos?

01:14:28.202 --> 01:14:31.902
Mike, we were never like that.

01:14:31.945 --> 01:14:33.686
Yes, we were.

01:14:34.818 --> 01:14:37.081
You just didn't see it.

01:14:37.124 --> 01:14:39.736
And I knew that if I could
get you back here

01:14:39.779 --> 01:14:41.651
that you would see it.

01:14:44.741 --> 01:14:46.090
What do you mean
get me back here?

01:14:46.133 --> 01:14:48.309
I tried to tell you how I felt.

01:14:49.267 --> 01:14:51.530
But you kept ignoring me.

01:14:51.574 --> 01:14:53.184
That was you?

01:14:53.227 --> 01:14:55.969
I needed you, I needed you
to come back here

01:14:56.013 --> 01:15:00.017
so that I could rekindle what
I know that you felt deep down.

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:05.022
And when sending you photos
didn't work, I...

01:15:07.241 --> 01:15:11.115
I had to act
a little more drastically.

01:15:11.158 --> 01:15:13.334
Oh...

01:15:13.378 --> 01:15:16.381
Whitney, I'm, I'm truly sorry
about your parents

01:15:16.424 --> 01:15:19.166
but you gave me no choice.

01:15:20.690 --> 01:15:22.735
You're a monster.

01:15:22.779 --> 01:15:25.521
Don't you say that!

01:15:25.564 --> 01:15:28.524
Everything I've done,
I have done for us.

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:35.269
Look at Meghan. She's okay.

01:15:35.313 --> 01:15:37.707
I didn't wanna hurt anyone else
that you cared about.

01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:39.622
I did that for you.

01:15:41.014 --> 01:15:43.669
Whitney, we can
still be together.

01:15:43.713 --> 01:15:45.584
This doesn't have to end.

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.588
Do you think

01:15:49.632 --> 01:15:53.374
that I would ever be with you
after all of this?

01:15:54.941 --> 01:15:57.248
I know it's not ideal...

01:15:58.292 --> 01:16:00.730
but, who knows...

01:16:02.122 --> 01:16:05.604
in time, maybe you could
grow to love me.

01:16:15.309 --> 01:16:16.484
Leave her alone!

01:16:20.271 --> 01:16:22.360
- Leave her alone!
- Listen.

01:16:22.403 --> 01:16:24.623
- Whit!
- Just wait. I...

01:16:24.667 --> 01:16:26.320
Whatever your obsession
is with me

01:16:26.364 --> 01:16:29.367
just take, take me,
just leave Meghan!

01:16:29.410 --> 01:16:32.979
- Stop!
- You know I can't do that.

01:16:33.023 --> 01:16:35.721
She wouldn't leave us alone.

01:16:35.765 --> 01:16:38.811
But if it helps,
I could let her stay with us.

01:16:38.855 --> 01:16:41.553
Kathy, too. We could be
a nice, sedated family.

01:16:45.426 --> 01:16:47.646
You are completely insane!

01:16:47.690 --> 01:16:51.215
Don't you see? I'll do anything
to be with you.

01:16:51.258 --> 01:16:53.696
That's how much I love you.

01:16:53.739 --> 01:16:57.264
It's okay.
I don't wanna hurt you.

01:16:57.308 --> 01:16:59.068
Just give in and everything
will be fine soon,

01:16:59.092 --> 01:17:00.920
this will all be behind us,

01:17:00.964 --> 01:17:02.966
and we can start
the rest of our lives together.

01:17:36.869 --> 01:17:37.869
Whit!

01:18:11.338 --> 01:18:13.384
Meghan, I'm so sorry.

01:18:14.733 --> 01:18:16.735
I should've listened
to you sooner.

01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:19.825
It's so... creepy,

01:18:19.869 --> 01:18:21.653
the fact that someone like that

01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:24.569
can invade your life so much.

01:18:24.612 --> 01:18:26.049
Yeah, but it's partly my fault.

01:18:26.092 --> 01:18:28.138
I mean, I'm the one
who posted it all out there

01:18:28.181 --> 01:18:30.575
in the first place.

01:18:30.618 --> 01:18:32.969
Whit, you can't
beat yourself up about that.

01:18:33.012 --> 01:18:36.886
- Some obsessed person...
- Thank you.

01:18:36.929 --> 01:18:39.758
You should not be afraid
to share your life.

01:18:41.194 --> 01:18:43.762
I just... can't imagine

01:18:43.806 --> 01:18:45.938
putting myself out there
after all this.

01:18:47.897 --> 01:18:49.768
So, are you out?

01:18:52.162 --> 01:18:54.555
I think the old Whitney
would've been too cautious

01:18:54.599 --> 01:18:57.384
to dive back in.

01:18:57.428 --> 01:18:59.473
So, what about now?

01:19:01.824 --> 01:19:02.825
Now...

01:19:05.653 --> 01:19:08.439
I see this as an opportunity

01:19:08.482 --> 01:19:10.702
to actually be authentic.

01:19:12.530 --> 01:19:14.488
You know, to express
who I really am

01:19:14.532 --> 01:19:16.055
instead of some polished,

01:19:16.099 --> 01:19:18.710
picture-perfect version
of myself.

01:19:20.277 --> 01:19:21.974
Wow!

01:19:22.018 --> 01:19:24.977
I guess taking down a psychopath
really changes a girl.

01:19:28.502 --> 01:19:30.548
Yeah, I guess it does.

01:19:41.864 --> 01:19:43.561
Okay, so, this is the first time

01:19:43.604 --> 01:19:45.215
I'm seeing the final version
of the PSA,

01:19:45.258 --> 01:19:47.130
so you are not allowed
to make fun of me.

01:19:47.173 --> 01:19:48.784
Uh, we'll see.

01:19:50.481 --> 01:19:52.526
Hi, I'm Whitney Sadler.

01:19:52.570 --> 01:19:55.007
And I am pleased to announce
that for the entire month,

01:19:55.051 --> 01:19:57.923
H2Almond has pledged
to match every dollar spent

01:19:57.967 --> 01:20:02.145
on their product as a donation
to the Lucas Bryant Foundation.

01:20:02.188 --> 01:20:05.409
This cause is very dear
to my heart,

01:20:05.452 --> 01:20:07.933
providing resources
to prevent online harassment,

01:20:07.977 --> 01:20:09.761
as well as tutorials ranging

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:11.894
from protecting
your online identity

01:20:11.937 --> 01:20:14.940
as well as to lessons
in self-defense.

01:20:14.984 --> 01:20:17.813
Because nobody should live
in fear of self expression.

01:20:20.206 --> 01:20:24.123
Okay, I have to admit
that's pretty cool.

01:20:24.167 --> 01:20:26.212
Yeah, well, it's the least
I could do.

01:20:26.256 --> 01:20:28.475
I'm serious,
Whit, this is awesome.

01:20:28.519 --> 01:20:30.086
I'm so proud of you.

01:20:30.129 --> 01:20:33.045
I'm just glad I can use
my voice for something good.

01:20:33.089 --> 01:20:35.787
Maybe help someone
from having to go through

01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:36.875
what I went through.

01:20:36.919 --> 01:20:38.964
I'm sure this will.

01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:43.142
So, is everything good?

01:20:43.186 --> 01:20:45.362
I mean, with you doing something
so charitable

01:20:45.405 --> 01:20:46.972
I'm sure it's generating hate

01:20:47.016 --> 01:20:49.018
from, you know,
all those idiots online.

01:20:49.061 --> 01:20:51.847
Oh, there are still weirdos
commenting on my videos.

01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:53.849
Look at this.

01:20:58.027 --> 01:21:00.159
Ugh. That's gross.

01:21:00.203 --> 01:21:02.379
And you're not freaking out
about it?

01:21:03.771 --> 01:21:05.382
Watch this.

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:10.909
- Wow! Hah!
- I know, right?

01:21:10.953 --> 01:21:12.563
Maybe next time
they'll think twice

01:21:12.606 --> 01:21:14.478
about what they're commenting.

01:21:15.958 --> 01:21:19.439
So, I was wondering...

01:21:19.483 --> 01:21:21.920
if you wanted to take
a trip to Costa Rica

01:21:21.964 --> 01:21:24.314
and go zip-lining?

01:21:24.357 --> 01:21:26.751
- You're kidding.
- No.

01:21:26.794 --> 01:21:29.536
I have some free time
and extra cash.

01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:31.277
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious!

01:21:33.105 --> 01:21:35.368
And someone I know
and love told me

01:21:35.412 --> 01:21:38.197
that I should take
a leap before I look.

01:21:38.241 --> 01:21:40.939
And I'm taking that literally.

01:21:40.983 --> 01:21:43.159
I'm liking this new Whitney.

01:21:43.202 --> 01:21:45.422
Me too.

01:21:45.465 --> 01:21:46.814
To new beginnings!

01:21:46.858 --> 01:21:48.729
I will drink to that.

01:22:03.353 --> 01:22:04.354
Hey, Whit.

01:22:09.663 --> 01:22:11.056
You miss me?

01:22:19.021 --> 01:22:21.110
Here's to new beginnings.

01:22:24.548 --> 01:22:26.463
I'll see you soon.
