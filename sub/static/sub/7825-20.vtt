and I've done that.

20:22.220 --> 20:23.790
Now, I'd better
get out of here

20:23.850 --> 20:25.390
before I lose my family.

20:27.490 --> 20:29.230
Just so I don't wonder--

20:29.290 --> 20:31.500
you would have gone
all the way with me,
wouldn't ya?

20:31.560 --> 20:32.360
Uh-huh.

20:32.430 --> 20:35.170
Ooh... okay.

20:35.230 --> 20:37.430
Now before we negotiate,
I have to tell you

20:37.500 --> 20:39.300
I'm desperate
to unload Lurleen

20:39.370 --> 20:40.940
and I'll take any offer.

20:41.000 --> 20:41.940
I'll give ya 50 bucks.

20:42.000 --> 20:42.760
You son of a..!

20:42.840 --> 20:43.710
Sold.

20:46.710 --> 20:48.950
<i>I caught my wife in bed</i>

20:49.010 --> 20:50.750
with my best friend.

20:50.810 --> 20:52.120
You bitter?

20:52.180 --> 20:54.690
Yep. Bit <i>him too.</i>

20:54.750 --> 20:55.620
( <i>laughing )</i>

20:55.680 --> 20:56.710
Ow!

20:56.780 --> 20:58.310
( <i>laughing )</i>

20:58.390 --> 21:00.920
And now, once again-- Lurleen.

21:00.990 --> 21:02.960
Homer?

21:03.020 --> 21:05.950
Is there any room in that bed
for a dad-burned fool?

21:06.030 --> 21:08.330
Always has been.

21:08.400 --> 21:11.870
I'd like to play a song
I wrote just this minute.

21:11.930 --> 21:15.260
It's called
"Stand By Your Manager."

21:15.340 --> 21:16.940
