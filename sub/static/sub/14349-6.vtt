00:06.047 --> 00:09.084
Captain's log, stardate 1329.8.

00:09.259 --> 00:12.260
The USS Enterprise in pursuit
of an unidentified vessel.

00:12.429 --> 00:13.627
There he is, sir.

00:13.805 --> 00:15.679
Centre screen.

00:16.766 --> 00:18.225
Still trying to run away from us, sir.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.184
Don't lose him, Mr. Sulu.

00:20.353 --> 00:21.977
No, sir.

00:27.985 --> 00:29.563
Earth ship, Mr. Spock?

00:29.737 --> 00:33.236
Difficult to say, captain. We're getting
no registration beam from it.

00:33.407 --> 00:36.028
If it is, he'll soon
overload his engines.

00:36.410 --> 00:38.698
Sir, he's pushing his engines too hard.

00:39.079 --> 00:40.573
Changing course again.

00:40.747 --> 00:42.206
He knows we're after him, all right.

00:42.582 --> 00:45.120
Stay with him, Mr. Sulu.

00:45.293 --> 00:47.749
- Communication?
- I've tried all frequencies, sir.

00:47.921 --> 00:49.083
He refuses to answer,

00:49.255 --> 00:50.749
unless he's not receiving us.

00:50.923 --> 00:52.750
Oh, he's receiving us all right.

00:54.093 --> 00:56.050
Approaching
an asteroid belt, captain.

00:56.220 --> 00:58.592
Shiller rating 3-5.

00:58.764 --> 01:00.009
Deflectors on, Mr. Farrell.

01:00.724 --> 01:01.922
He's seen the asteroid too, sir.

01:03.227 --> 01:04.602
Stay with him.

01:04.769 --> 01:06.229
He'll try to lose us in them.

01:06.814 --> 01:08.094
If one of them hits him...

01:08.273 --> 01:10.432
Sensor reading
on the vessel, captain.

01:10.609 --> 01:14.558
I make it out as a small
class-J cargo ship.

01:14.738 --> 01:17.692
And his engines are superheating.

01:18.950 --> 01:20.658
Try to warn him.
If he loses power now...

01:20.827 --> 01:22.025
There go his engines, sir.

01:23.997 --> 01:27.033
He's drifting into asteroid belt, captain.

01:27.208 --> 01:28.370
He's had it,

01:28.543 --> 01:30.915
unless we put our
deflector screen around him.

01:31.087 --> 01:33.494
Captain, if we try, we'll
overload our own engines.

01:33.672 --> 01:35.083
He's too far away.

01:43.473 --> 01:45.549
Cover him with our
deflector screen, Mr. Farrell.

01:48.395 --> 01:51.349
Scotty, Spock,
stand by in the Transporter Room.

01:51.523 --> 01:53.266
Aye, sir.

01:55.485 --> 01:57.145
We're protecting him, sir.

01:57.320 --> 01:59.526
We won't be able to hold him long.

02:01.490 --> 02:04.491
We're overloading, captain.
Engine temperatures climbing.

02:15.587 --> 02:19.501
Space, the final frontier.

02:19.674 --> 02:23.292
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

02:23.470 --> 02:28.345
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

02:28.516 --> 02:31.517
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

02:32.353 --> 02:35.888
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

03:13.017 --> 03:14.215
This is the Engine Room.

03:14.393 --> 03:16.551
Temperatures are passing
the danger line.

03:16.729 --> 03:18.555
Our deflector screen's weakening, sir.

03:18.731 --> 03:20.059
We can't protect them much longer.

03:27.781 --> 03:29.904
That was one of our
lithium-crystal circuits, sir.

03:30.075 --> 03:31.237
Bridge to Transporter Room.

03:31.409 --> 03:33.568
If you don't start beaming
that crew over soon...

03:33.745 --> 03:35.369
They're not answering our signal.

03:35.538 --> 03:37.744
There's nothing to lock on to.

03:41.752 --> 03:44.208
Another circuit, sir.

03:49.134 --> 03:51.756
I'm getting a distress signal
call from them, sir.

03:51.929 --> 03:54.301
Scotty, we're getting
a distress signal.

03:55.307 --> 03:57.216
We're locked on
to something, captain.

04:10.571 --> 04:15.566
Meaning no ingratitude, gentlemen,
but just where is it I find meself?

04:15.743 --> 04:18.744
You're aboard the USS Enterprise.

04:18.913 --> 04:22.495
Oh, it's really a darn
beautiful ship, isn't it?

04:22.666 --> 04:25.952
Really a beautiful ship.

04:26.462 --> 04:29.913
The name, gentlemen, is Walsh.
Captain Leo Walsh.

04:30.090 --> 04:31.465
How many more in your crew?

04:32.134 --> 04:33.960
Just a few more.

04:34.261 --> 04:35.636
Your vessel's breaking up, man.

04:35.804 --> 04:37.512
If we don't get them
over here right now...

04:37.680 --> 04:40.717
Well, we couldn't be sure you was
a friendly vessel, now, could we?

04:40.892 --> 04:44.426
But the three of them will be
in position right about by now.

04:49.650 --> 04:51.892
Another lithium circuit.

04:52.069 --> 04:54.394
Now supplementing
with battery power, sir.

04:54.572 --> 04:56.066
Scotty,

04:56.240 --> 04:57.615
how many of them
did you get aboard?

04:57.950 --> 05:00.654
Only one, sir.
But we've locked on to three more.

05:02.496 --> 05:03.658
What's wrong?

05:04.081 --> 05:05.456
I don't know, sir.

05:05.624 --> 05:07.497
With those three
lithium crystals gone...

05:07.667 --> 05:09.161
At best, it'll take longer on battery.

05:09.336 --> 05:11.162
Never did trust this
thing in the first place.

05:11.921 --> 05:13.546
There she goes.

05:18.803 --> 05:21.554
Asteroid. Hit him dead centre.

05:22.306 --> 05:23.421
Bridge to Transporter Room.

05:23.599 --> 05:25.592
Their vessel has been
hit by an asteroid. It's gone.

05:25.768 --> 05:27.179
Did you get the crew off?

05:27.353 --> 05:29.844
Not yet, sir, but we've
hooked on to something.

05:49.707 --> 05:52.079
Kirk to Transporter Room. Report.

06:03.220 --> 06:04.928
It's all right, darlings.

06:05.097 --> 06:07.255
We're in good hands.

06:07.432 --> 06:08.713
Bridge to Transporter Room.

06:08.892 --> 06:11.217
We're clearing the asteroid
belt now, captain.

06:11.395 --> 06:13.517
Deflector screen down, Mr. Farrell.
Conserve power.

06:15.065 --> 06:16.725
Captain to Transporter Room.

06:16.900 --> 06:19.391
Are you reading me or not,
Mr. Scott?

06:21.029 --> 06:23.946
Bridge to Transporter Room.
How many did we get off?

06:28.411 --> 06:29.525
Four in all, sir.

06:29.704 --> 06:33.571
If the captain of that vessel can walk,
I want him in my cabin immediately.

06:33.749 --> 06:35.077
Correction.

06:35.251 --> 06:38.038
I want him there whether
he can walk or not. Kirk out.

06:38.921 --> 06:42.171
That fella sounded
a mite upset, didn't he?

06:43.383 --> 06:45.127
Yes.

06:45.302 --> 06:46.926
Yes, they are.

06:50.807 --> 06:52.634
Curious.

06:52.809 --> 06:54.885
You're certain this was everyone
aboard, Mr. Walsh?

06:55.061 --> 06:56.224
No other crewmen?

06:56.396 --> 06:58.020
Oh, no, that's everyone all right.

06:58.189 --> 07:01.772
But so far as the ladies
actually being the crew...

07:01.943 --> 07:03.935
You can explain that to the captain.

07:22.837 --> 07:25.922
Amen to that, Scotty.

07:32.472 --> 07:35.971
Oh, sure, these starships
are really something marvellous,

07:36.142 --> 07:39.676
but men will always be men,
no matter where they are.

07:39.854 --> 07:43.222
Hey, mister, you'll never
take that out of them.

07:46.485 --> 07:48.524
Deck 12.

07:48.695 --> 07:51.566
You're part Vulcanian, aren't you?

07:52.491 --> 07:55.694
Well then, a pretty face
doesn't affect you at all, does it?

07:55.869 --> 07:57.945
That is, not unless you want it to.

07:59.247 --> 08:00.789
You can save it, girls.

08:00.957 --> 08:03.662
This type can turn himself off
from any emotion.

08:08.673 --> 08:10.215
I apologise for what he said, sir.

08:10.383 --> 08:12.042
He's so used to buying
and selling people...

08:12.218 --> 08:15.918
I'll handle the conversation, darling.

08:23.770 --> 08:25.181
Come.

08:26.898 --> 08:29.270
The commander of the transport
to see you, captain.

08:29.651 --> 08:33.067
Good. Now, if you don't mind telling...

08:44.498 --> 08:45.529
Hello.

08:49.211 --> 08:50.539
Hello, ladies.

08:50.713 --> 08:52.171
Is this your crew, captain?

08:52.339 --> 08:54.047
Well, no, captain.

08:54.216 --> 08:56.967
This is me cargo.

09:09.480 --> 09:13.893
Captain's log, stardate 1329.1.

09:14.068 --> 09:16.144
We have taken aboard
from unregistered transport vessel,

09:16.320 --> 09:18.443
its captain

09:18.614 --> 09:20.571
and three unusual females.

09:20.741 --> 09:22.983
These women have a
mysterious magnetic effect

09:23.160 --> 09:25.236
on the male members of my crew,

09:25.412 --> 09:27.737
including myself.

09:27.915 --> 09:30.584
Explanation unknown at present.

09:32.002 --> 09:35.287
Well, how the devil am I supposed
to know this is a starship, captain?

09:35.463 --> 09:37.539
There I am with a cargo
of young lovelies,

09:37.715 --> 09:39.423
a strange ship
comes up alongside...

09:39.592 --> 09:41.834
Well, naturally I did me
best to evade you.

09:42.011 --> 09:45.462
And starship captain or no,
you exceeded your authority

09:45.640 --> 09:48.391
when you drove me and mine
into a shower of asteroids.

09:48.559 --> 09:50.765
- Your name, please?
- Walsh. Leo Walsh.

09:50.936 --> 09:52.478
You destroyed me ship, captain.

09:52.646 --> 09:55.481
Mr. Walsh, I'm convening
a ship's hearing on your actions.

09:55.983 --> 09:57.774
Mr. Spock will supply you with any

09:57.943 --> 10:01.193
legal information you may need
for your defence.

10:01.363 --> 10:04.648
- You're a hard-nosed one, captain.
- And you're a liar, Mr. Walsh.

10:05.992 --> 10:07.784
I think we both
understand each other.

10:08.370 --> 10:09.615
Security.

10:11.331 --> 10:13.738
Escort Mr. Walsh to his quarters.
Confine him there.

10:29.556 --> 10:31.264
You're on duty, Johnny-O.

10:31.433 --> 10:33.390
Back to reality.

10:34.478 --> 10:37.644
You can feel their eyes
when they look at you.

10:37.814 --> 10:39.641
Like something grabbing hold of you.

10:39.816 --> 10:42.224
- You notice that?
- I noticed.

10:42.402 --> 10:44.062
How I noticed.

10:44.237 --> 10:46.644
Cool it, now, Johnny, okay?

10:48.783 --> 10:51.155
I've got trouble, Mr. Spock.

10:51.327 --> 10:53.616
I'm well aware of that, Mr. Scott.

10:53.788 --> 10:58.414
One lithium crystal left, and that
with a hairline split at the base.

10:59.293 --> 11:00.787
Better rig a bypass circuit.

11:00.961 --> 11:05.173
Can't. We blew the whole
converter assembly.

11:08.093 --> 11:10.631
- Kirk here.
- Needed on the bridge, captain.

11:15.100 --> 11:17.507
Calm down, now.

11:17.685 --> 11:19.180
Do you mind waiting outside?

11:19.354 --> 11:20.848
- Sorry, sir.
- Well.

11:21.022 --> 11:24.142
Now, answer every question
they put to you. Don't lie.

11:24.317 --> 11:25.941
Well, you've no need to, have you?

11:26.110 --> 11:28.316
And don't submit to a med...

11:28.487 --> 11:32.401
That is, being so healthy, they've no
need for a medical exam, have they?

11:32.575 --> 11:35.575
- But what if they ask us about..?
- They won't.

11:36.495 --> 11:38.784
- Have you no place to go, lads?
- They'll notice we're dif...

11:38.956 --> 11:40.366
No, no, no, they won't.

11:40.540 --> 11:43.292
You just let Leo take
all the hard questions.

11:43.460 --> 11:45.168
Now, don't be panicking, loves.

11:45.337 --> 11:47.495
- We'll get to...
- Get where?

11:47.672 --> 11:49.914
We don't have a ship, and we're
headed the wrong way, Harry.

11:50.091 --> 11:51.502
Le...

11:52.343 --> 11:55.428
Leo. Leo Walsh is me name, darling.

11:55.596 --> 11:57.221
Don't forget that.

11:57.390 --> 11:59.762
So lovely. Lovely, aren't they?

11:59.934 --> 12:02.888
If they'll only think
lovely thoughts, if they smile,

12:03.062 --> 12:05.767
why, they'll come out right
some which way, now, won't they?

12:05.940 --> 12:07.813
Me personal guarantee on that.

12:11.904 --> 12:16.400
The entire ship's power is feeding
through one lithium crystal.

12:17.242 --> 12:18.902
Then switch to bypass circuits.

12:19.077 --> 12:21.319
We burned them all out
when we superheated, captain.

12:21.496 --> 12:25.244
That jackass Walsh not only wrecked
his own vessel, but in saving his skin...

12:25.416 --> 12:27.290
If it makes you feel
any better, engineer,

12:27.460 --> 12:30.081
that's one jackass
we're going to see skinned.

12:30.254 --> 12:31.879
But it's frustrating.

12:32.048 --> 12:34.373
Almost a million gross tons of vessel

12:34.550 --> 12:36.839
depending on a hunk
of crystal the size of my fist.

12:37.011 --> 12:38.884
And that crystal won't hold up.

12:39.430 --> 12:41.636
Not pulling all our power through it.

12:42.391 --> 12:43.636
Well, Mr. Spock?

12:43.809 --> 12:47.593
There's a lithium-mining operation
on Rigel Xll.

12:47.771 --> 12:50.641
- High-grade ore, I've heard.
- Location and distance.

12:50.816 --> 12:52.808
Mr. Farrell has the course.

12:52.984 --> 12:55.985
- Less than two days' travel.
- Make for Rigel Xll, Mr. Spock.

12:56.404 --> 12:58.195
Rigel Xll, Mr. Farrell.

12:58.364 --> 13:00.571
You have the course.

13:02.994 --> 13:06.943
Captain's log, stardate 1329.2.

13:07.123 --> 13:10.289
Onboard the USS Enterprise,
a ship's hearing is being convened

13:10.459 --> 13:12.867
against the transport
vessel's captain.

13:13.045 --> 13:15.880
I'm becoming concerned
about the almost hypnotic effect

13:16.048 --> 13:17.423
produced by the women.

13:17.591 --> 13:19.963
This hearing is convened.

13:20.135 --> 13:25.342
Stardate 1329.2, onboard
starship USS Enterprise.

13:25.515 --> 13:30.058
Formal hearings against
Transport Captain Leo Walsh.

13:30.728 --> 13:31.760
Start computer.

13:35.692 --> 13:37.102
State your name for the record.

13:37.777 --> 13:39.236
Leo Francis Walsh.

13:39.612 --> 13:41.604
Incorrect.

13:43.157 --> 13:44.532
Your correct name.

13:48.537 --> 13:50.993
Gentlemen, surely you're not
going to take the word of a soulless

13:51.165 --> 13:53.786
mechanical device over that
of a real flesh-and-blood man.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.746
State your correct name for the record.

14:01.966 --> 14:05.335
- Harry Mudd.
- Incorrect.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.303
Harcourt Fenton Mudd.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.014
Any past offences, Mr. Mudd?

14:09.640 --> 14:13.056
Of course not. Gentlemen,
I'm simply an honest businessman.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.686
Incorrect.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.523
Blast that tin-plated pot.

14:18.190 --> 14:21.524
Full data coming on screen.

14:23.362 --> 14:25.520
If it can read our minds too...

14:25.697 --> 14:27.191
They can't, darling. They can't.

14:27.366 --> 14:29.109
Just what's on the record.

14:29.701 --> 14:31.824
Offence record: Smuggling.

14:31.995 --> 14:34.201
Sentence: Suspended.

14:34.372 --> 14:36.697
Transport of stolen goods.

14:36.875 --> 14:40.658
Purchase of space vessel
with counterfeit currency.

14:41.045 --> 14:45.374
Sentences: Psychiatric treatment.
Effectiveness disputed.

14:45.550 --> 14:49.962
Mr. Mudd, you are charged with
galaxy travel without a flight plan,

14:50.137 --> 14:51.715
without an identification beam,

14:51.889 --> 14:54.012
and failure to answer
a starship's signal,

14:54.183 --> 14:55.891
thus effecting a menace
to navigation...

14:56.060 --> 14:59.060
What, my tiny little ship
in this immense galaxy?

14:59.229 --> 15:02.645
A menace to navig..?

15:02.816 --> 15:06.399
You're also charged with operation
of a vessel without a master's licence.

15:06.570 --> 15:08.811
Untrue. I have a master's ticket.

15:08.988 --> 15:10.020
Incorrect.

15:10.198 --> 15:14.943
Master's licence revoked,
stardate 1116.4.

15:15.119 --> 15:16.827
All right.

15:16.996 --> 15:19.238
Well, very simply,

15:19.415 --> 15:22.950
Leo Walsh, who was to be
my captain on this trip,

15:23.127 --> 15:24.954
passed away suddenly.

15:25.504 --> 15:27.995
I had no choice but to take out
me ship me own self, did I?

15:28.757 --> 15:33.798
Well l... I assumed Leo's name
for this voyage, out of...

15:33.971 --> 15:36.758
...courtesy to him.
In memoriam, as it were.

15:36.932 --> 15:38.841
Fine, fine man.

15:39.017 --> 15:42.386
Alas, gone to his reward.

15:42.729 --> 15:44.721
Destination and purpose of journey?

15:44.898 --> 15:48.397
Planet Ophiuchus III.
Wiving settlers.

15:49.819 --> 15:52.061
Come again, Mr. Mudd?
You do what?

15:52.238 --> 15:54.480
I recruit wives for settlers.

15:54.657 --> 15:58.489
A difficult but satisfying task.

15:59.453 --> 16:00.532
Data on witnesses.

16:08.962 --> 16:11.251
No data.

16:11.715 --> 16:14.715
Computer, go to sensor probe.
Any unusual readings?

16:15.301 --> 16:18.386
No decipherable reading on females.

16:18.846 --> 16:23.140
However, unusual reading
on male board members.

16:23.309 --> 16:26.808
Detecting high respiration patterns,

16:26.979 --> 16:29.897
perspiration rates up,

16:30.065 --> 16:32.307
heartbeat rapid,

16:32.484 --> 16:34.394
blood pressure higher than normal.

16:36.405 --> 16:38.362
Well, that's sufficient.

16:39.074 --> 16:40.983
Strike that from the record,
Mr. Spock.

16:43.453 --> 16:45.991
Do you see, gentlemen?
Just as I told you,

16:46.164 --> 16:50.162
three lovely ladies
destined for frontier planets

16:50.335 --> 16:53.004
to be the companions
of lonely men.

16:53.171 --> 16:57.334
To supply that warmth of a human
touch that's so desperately needed.

16:57.508 --> 17:00.758
A wife, a home, a family.

17:01.053 --> 17:05.430
Gentlemen, I look upon this work
as a sacred public trust.

17:05.598 --> 17:07.223
I've devoted me whole life to it.

17:07.393 --> 17:09.718
Incorrect.

17:10.020 --> 17:14.682
Well, I'm about to start devoting
my entire life to it.

17:15.650 --> 17:17.608
Did these ladies come voluntarily?

17:18.236 --> 17:20.988
Well, of course. For example,

17:21.156 --> 17:24.192
Ruthie here comes from
a pelagic planet. Sea ranches.

17:24.367 --> 17:27.036
Magda, there, from
the Halium experimental station.

17:27.203 --> 17:30.488
It's the same story
for all of us, captain. No men.

17:31.290 --> 17:32.998
Mine was a farm planet

17:33.167 --> 17:34.994
with automated machines
for company,

17:35.169 --> 17:39.083
and two brothers to cook for,
mend their clothes,

17:39.256 --> 17:41.961
canal mud a foot thick on their boots
every time they walked in.

17:42.134 --> 17:46.048
- Fine, Evie, fine.
- No, it's not fine.

17:46.221 --> 17:48.890
We've got men willing
to be our husbands waiting for us

17:49.057 --> 17:51.513
and you're taking us
in the opposite direction.

17:52.560 --> 17:56.890
Staring at us like we were Saturnius
harem girls or something.

17:57.065 --> 17:58.144
That's enough, Evie.

18:00.193 --> 18:02.731
The only charges
are against Mr. Mudd,

18:02.904 --> 18:04.896
illegal operation of a vessel.

18:05.448 --> 18:06.990
Do you have any defence to offer?

18:07.199 --> 18:09.358
Only heaven's own truth,

18:09.535 --> 18:11.362
which I've just given you.

18:15.874 --> 18:18.246
The hearing is closed.

18:19.002 --> 18:22.453
Mr. Mudd to be handed over
to the legal authorities

18:22.631 --> 18:25.169
at our earliest opportunity.

18:31.264 --> 18:34.051
And what about us?
What happens to us?

18:34.225 --> 18:35.933
Help us, please, all of us.

18:36.102 --> 18:38.308
Miss McHuron, if you don't mind...

18:41.607 --> 18:43.101
The last crystal, sir. It's gone.

18:43.275 --> 18:47.107
Captain Kirk, Engineering section
reports our entire life-support system

18:47.279 --> 18:48.607
is now on batteries.

18:48.781 --> 18:51.271
- Mr. Spock... Miss McHuron, please.
- No, please.

18:51.450 --> 18:54.616
Would you mind? Mr. Spock, will
you contact the miners on Rigel Xll?

18:54.786 --> 18:58.404
Notify them that we'll need the lithium
crystals immediately upon arrival.

19:03.795 --> 19:07.377
Oh, you beautiful galaxy.

19:07.548 --> 19:10.715
Oh, that heavenly universe.

19:10.885 --> 19:13.127
Why, girls, lithium miners.

19:13.304 --> 19:15.592
Don't you understand?

19:15.765 --> 19:21.600
Lonely, isolated, overworked,
rich lithium miners.

19:21.770 --> 19:24.059
Girls, do you still want husbands?

19:24.231 --> 19:27.481
Evie, you won't have to be satisfied
with a mere ship's captain.

19:27.651 --> 19:31.150
I'll get you a man
who can buy you a whole planet.

19:31.321 --> 19:33.610
Maggie, you're going
to be a countess.

19:33.782 --> 19:36.237
Ruth, I'll make you a duchess.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.152
And I...

19:40.079 --> 19:43.662
I'll be running this starship.

19:44.458 --> 19:46.617
Captain James Kirk,

19:46.794 --> 19:52.666
the next orders you're taking will be
given by Harcourt Fenton Mudd.

20:01.600 --> 20:04.387
Captain's log, stardate 1330.1.

20:04.561 --> 20:07.930
Position, 14 hours out of Rigel Xll.

20:08.106 --> 20:09.600
We're on auxiliary impulse engines.

20:09.774 --> 20:13.357
Fuel low, barely sufficient
to achieve orbit over the planet.

20:13.528 --> 20:16.197
Lithium replacements
are now imperative.

20:16.364 --> 20:18.985
The effect of Mudd's women
on my crew continues to grow,

20:19.158 --> 20:21.198
still totally unexplained.

20:21.369 --> 20:24.951
Harry Mudd is confined
to his quarters under guard.

20:28.876 --> 20:31.117
May I come in?

20:37.509 --> 20:40.463
Why, yes. Please do, by all means.

20:44.557 --> 20:46.882
Connors, are you finished?

20:49.479 --> 20:53.061
I was wondering what
this place looked like.

21:05.619 --> 21:07.078
It's fascinating.

21:07.245 --> 21:08.277
Would..?

21:08.455 --> 21:12.037
Would you walk past
my panel again, please?

21:13.251 --> 21:14.496
Your what?

21:16.087 --> 21:17.712
My medical scanner.

21:17.881 --> 21:21.084
Oh, why? You're not giving me
an examination, are you?

21:21.259 --> 21:24.259
Oh, no, I wouldn't trust my...

21:24.428 --> 21:27.963
My judgement. Believe me.
Just walk by, please.

21:36.899 --> 21:38.476
It's not supposed to do that.

21:43.113 --> 21:47.360
I wondered, will you be examining
the miners on Rigel Xll?

21:48.159 --> 21:49.867
Yes, if they need it.

21:52.455 --> 21:53.997
You mean you haven't asked yet?

21:54.165 --> 21:56.738
Are they in good health and all that?

21:56.918 --> 21:58.412
What?

21:59.712 --> 22:01.087
Oh, yes.

22:01.255 --> 22:02.915
They're in excellent health.

22:03.090 --> 22:04.205
All three of them.

22:05.175 --> 22:07.417
Oh, three.

22:11.181 --> 22:15.261
Are you wearing some
unusual kind of perfume,

22:15.435 --> 22:18.056
or something radioactive, my dear?

22:18.230 --> 22:20.305
No. I'm just me.

22:22.484 --> 22:25.354
I wonder what makes it do that.

22:27.530 --> 22:28.561
Captain.

22:30.825 --> 22:33.067
I hope you don't mind.

22:37.581 --> 22:39.953
As a matter of fact,
Ms. McHuron, I do.

22:40.125 --> 22:42.165
Well, I was trying
to take a walk, and I just...

22:42.336 --> 22:45.171
I just had to run in
someplace. You see...

22:45.339 --> 22:47.876
I mean, all your men
were looking at me,

22:48.049 --> 22:49.757
following me with their eyes.

22:51.845 --> 22:55.048
Yes. I'll have to talk
to them about that.

22:58.309 --> 23:00.017
They...

23:00.186 --> 23:03.685
...don't do that ordinarily,
Ms. McHuron.

23:03.856 --> 23:06.643
But somehow in your case,
and the ladies with you, it's...

23:06.817 --> 23:11.230
Well, they're probably just lonely.

23:11.697 --> 23:14.188
I can understand loneliness.

23:15.576 --> 23:16.856
Yes.

23:19.871 --> 23:22.113
Yes. Now, Miss McHuron,
if you don't mind, l...

23:22.290 --> 23:24.034
l... I suppose

23:24.209 --> 23:26.036
I suppose you
understand it even more.

23:26.503 --> 23:30.666
I mean, having to run
a huge ship like this

23:30.840 --> 23:34.885
with so much responsibility
every minute

23:35.052 --> 23:38.753
and having to be so careful
with all your men looking up to you...

23:42.184 --> 23:46.645
Well, it probably appears
more difficult than it is.

23:47.981 --> 23:50.982
I read once, a commander
has to act like a paragon of virtue.

23:51.151 --> 23:53.820
I never met a paragon.

23:55.489 --> 23:56.899
Neither have I.

23:57.073 --> 23:59.695
Well, of course not. No one is.

23:59.868 --> 24:03.735
But some people try to pretend.

24:05.790 --> 24:07.783
Do you, captain?

24:07.959 --> 24:10.959
Ms. McHuron, l... I don't...

24:11.128 --> 24:13.702
Oh, no.

24:14.173 --> 24:17.672
Oh, I just can't do it.
I don't care what Harry Mudd says.

24:17.843 --> 24:19.966
I do like you,

24:20.137 --> 24:22.260
and I just can't go through with it.

24:22.431 --> 24:25.052
I hate this whole thing!

24:42.450 --> 24:43.730
Just three, you're sure?

24:43.910 --> 24:47.029
Yes, the miners are healthy
and fairly young.

24:47.204 --> 24:48.449
Later, dear.

24:48.622 --> 24:51.457
Magda, did you get
to your communications man?

24:51.625 --> 24:54.330
The head miner
is named Ben Childress.

24:54.503 --> 24:56.875
The others are Gossett and Benton.

24:57.047 --> 25:00.380
- And they've been there...
- Almost three years now.

25:00.550 --> 25:02.543
Alone.

25:02.719 --> 25:03.917
Perfect.

25:04.095 --> 25:05.376
Perfect.

25:05.555 --> 25:11.142
Three of them, and three
lovely ladies has Harry Mudd.

25:11.311 --> 25:14.679
And lithium crystals,
my dear, are worth

25:14.856 --> 25:17.809
300 times their weight in diamonds.

25:17.984 --> 25:20.391
Thousands of times
their weight in gold.

25:20.569 --> 25:22.977
But they'll be down there,
and we'll be up here

25:23.155 --> 25:25.907
circling a hundred miles above them.

25:26.075 --> 25:28.482
And there's a guard
outside your door, Harry.

25:28.660 --> 25:30.320
You can't get out of your cabin.

25:30.495 --> 25:31.658
No, my dears.

25:31.830 --> 25:37.334
After one more little job for you,
it won't be Harry Mudd that's trapped.

25:37.502 --> 25:41.085
It'll be a gentleman
named James T...

25:45.176 --> 25:47.845
I don't like you.

25:48.679 --> 25:52.511
And I'm not very happy
with myself either.

25:52.683 --> 25:54.557
Well, I'm not really surprised.

25:54.727 --> 25:56.803
I've seen you noticing the captain.

25:56.979 --> 26:00.644
We're supposed to notice them!

26:02.693 --> 26:04.816
Oh, Harry, l...

26:04.987 --> 26:07.394
I don't feel very good.

26:09.074 --> 26:11.150
I think it must be near the time.

26:15.121 --> 26:19.035
I asked for a preorbital
course, Mr. Farrell.

26:20.418 --> 26:22.375
Pre-orbital course locked in, sir.

26:22.545 --> 26:26.542
That's the last time I'm giving
an order twice, gentlemen.

26:26.716 --> 26:28.874
We're down to battery power,
and we're low on that.

26:29.051 --> 26:31.803
They'll get us to Rigel Xll, sir,
but it'll be a shaky orbit.

26:31.971 --> 26:34.722
Just hang us in there long enough
to get six crystals, Scotty.

26:34.890 --> 26:37.677
- That's all we need.
- I'll get you there.

26:39.436 --> 26:40.764
Ridiculous.

26:40.937 --> 26:43.060
What are we running here?

26:43.231 --> 26:44.394
Did you examine them?

26:44.566 --> 26:46.475
Did you examine Eve?

26:46.860 --> 26:48.686
She refused.

26:49.362 --> 26:51.687
Well, come on, you're the doctor.

26:55.034 --> 26:56.742
What is it?

26:57.119 --> 27:00.951
Is it that we're tired,
and they're beautiful?

27:01.999 --> 27:05.783
And they are incredibly beautiful.

27:06.503 --> 27:11.580
Are they, Jim? Are they actually
more lovely, pound for pound,

27:11.758 --> 27:16.586
measurement for measurement,
than any other women you've known?

27:16.763 --> 27:18.341
Or is it that they just...

27:19.265 --> 27:21.839
...well, act beautiful?

27:22.310 --> 27:24.801
No, strike that. Strike that.

27:25.188 --> 27:27.227
What are they, Bones?

27:28.608 --> 27:33.353
You mean, are they alien illusions,
that sort of thing?

27:33.904 --> 27:36.027
I asked you first.

27:37.992 --> 27:39.320
No.

27:39.493 --> 27:41.900
An alien smart enough to pull this
would be smart enough to keep

27:42.079 --> 27:44.118
my medical scanner from going:

27:45.624 --> 27:47.166
I don't follow you.

27:47.709 --> 27:49.287
I don't either.

27:49.961 --> 27:53.247
Top-space frequency of 3-9.

28:00.096 --> 28:02.634
Rigel Xll. Rigel Xll.

28:02.807 --> 28:05.558
This is Rigel Xll.
Come in, Enterprise.

28:05.851 --> 28:08.556
Well, this isn't exactly
the Enterprise.

28:08.729 --> 28:10.638
My name is Harry Mudd.

28:11.273 --> 28:14.476
To whom have I
the pleasure of speaking, sir?

28:24.202 --> 28:25.862
Power curve still dropping, captain.

28:27.414 --> 28:28.528
We'll make orbit, sir.

28:28.706 --> 28:30.331
- A temporary one.
- Lay in.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.077
Computer.

28:32.251 --> 28:36.794
We can sustain this orbit
for three days, seven hours.

28:36.964 --> 28:37.995
More than enough time.

28:38.174 --> 28:41.174
Communications, have a
representative of the Rigel Xll miners

28:41.343 --> 28:43.003
meet us here to discuss our need.

28:43.178 --> 28:46.013
- Beam him up first pass over the camp.
- Yes, sir.

28:48.684 --> 28:50.723
What's happening?

28:51.395 --> 28:53.683
Look at my face.

29:00.320 --> 29:02.359
Give us the pills.

29:04.866 --> 29:08.116
What if someone sees us like this?

29:08.619 --> 29:10.944
You'll never find them, Harry.

29:12.456 --> 29:15.161
And if you do find them...

29:15.751 --> 29:17.210
...you know what they are?

29:18.379 --> 29:19.541
A cheat.

29:21.131 --> 29:25.793
If you care for someone,
really care...

29:25.969 --> 29:27.878
For whom, Evie? For Kirk?

29:28.054 --> 29:31.221
You'll find out that ship's captains are
already married, girl. To their vessels.

29:31.391 --> 29:33.549
You'd find that out the first time you
came between him and the ship.

29:33.726 --> 29:35.055
You'll see.

29:36.271 --> 29:38.892
I'm going back to what I was.

29:39.065 --> 29:43.276
- Ugly.
- I can't stand myself like this.

29:43.444 --> 29:45.437
Why did you hide them, Harry?

29:45.613 --> 29:48.282
- Don't you trust us?
- I didn't hide them, girl.

29:48.449 --> 29:51.153
I put them in a safe place
in case I was searched.

29:51.327 --> 29:53.652
Find the pill, Harry.

29:54.913 --> 29:57.120
Mattress.

29:58.625 --> 30:00.701
Yes, here.

30:19.687 --> 30:22.937
Go on, Eve, take it.

30:23.107 --> 30:24.815
It's not a cheat.

30:27.236 --> 30:29.608
It's a miracle.

30:30.822 --> 30:33.029
For some man who can appreciate it...

30:33.617 --> 30:35.989
...and who needs it.

31:15.823 --> 31:19.323
Even burned and cracked,
they're beautiful.

31:19.494 --> 31:21.154
Destroying them was a shame.

31:21.329 --> 31:22.527
Not at all, Mr. Spock.

31:22.705 --> 31:25.990
The choice was burning this lithium
crystal or the destruction

31:26.167 --> 31:27.709
of another man's ship.

31:29.336 --> 31:30.747
Come.

31:31.505 --> 31:33.830
Sir, Mining Chief Childress
and Mr. Gossett.

31:34.007 --> 31:35.502
Good. Show them in.

31:37.052 --> 31:39.044
I'm James Kirk,
captain of the Enterprise.

31:39.221 --> 31:40.679
This is my science officer, Mr. Spock.

31:40.889 --> 31:42.846
Let's get right to business.

31:43.016 --> 31:44.807
You want lithium crystals,
and we've got them.

31:45.018 --> 31:47.425
Fine. I'm authorized
to pay an equitable price.

31:47.604 --> 31:49.347
We're not sure
they're for sale, captain.

31:50.773 --> 31:52.018
We might prefer a swap.

31:53.693 --> 31:55.068
What did you have in mind?

31:56.320 --> 31:57.399
Mudd's women.

31:59.115 --> 32:02.365
If we like them. We'd like to have
a look at them first, of course.

32:02.534 --> 32:03.863
Right.

32:04.036 --> 32:07.202
Trot them out, captain.
Oh, and Harry Mudd.

32:07.372 --> 32:11.702
Either way, I've agreed to have
him released, charges dropped.

32:16.089 --> 32:17.369
Is there anything else?

32:19.592 --> 32:22.048
You've got no choice, Kirk.

32:22.220 --> 32:26.087
You beam a landing party down,
and you won't find one blessed crystal.

32:30.019 --> 32:31.050
No deal.

32:38.235 --> 32:40.643
You're a long way out
in space, gentlemen.

32:40.821 --> 32:44.901
You'll need medical help,
cargo runs, starship protection.

32:45.075 --> 32:46.902
You wanna consider
those facts too?

32:47.452 --> 32:48.615
Come along, ladies. Come along.

32:48.787 --> 32:52.405
You must be Ben Childress.
Come on now, girls. Come on.

32:52.582 --> 32:55.155
And you must be Herm Gossett.

32:55.919 --> 32:57.911
Yes, I reckon I am.

32:59.088 --> 33:02.920
One thing I'll say for you,
Mudd, you're not a liar.

33:04.051 --> 33:06.756
And ladies, you are welcome.

33:06.929 --> 33:08.589
It's still no deal.

33:09.807 --> 33:12.262
Conserving batteries, sir. Half power.

33:12.601 --> 33:17.595
I'm told they have only three days of
orbit left before they start spiralling in.

33:18.231 --> 33:22.774
I do hate to see you suffering such
a situation, captain, but truth is truth,

33:22.944 --> 33:26.147
and the sad fact is, you will deal.

33:26.322 --> 33:29.857
Sooner or later, you'll have to.

33:40.669 --> 33:41.749
Captain's log.

33:41.921 --> 33:44.791
Transporting down
to surface of planet Rigel Xll

33:44.965 --> 33:47.717
to acquire replacement
lithium crystals.

33:47.885 --> 33:50.126
Expect further difficulty from miners.

34:34.469 --> 34:36.094
All right, Childress, you've won.

34:36.264 --> 34:38.172
Now I'll take the lithium crystals.

34:39.350 --> 34:41.556
When I have the time, Kirk.

34:44.522 --> 34:45.931
Childress.

34:46.107 --> 34:47.850
We're busy, Mr. Kirk.

34:55.239 --> 34:58.324
We don't have
the time to spare, captain.

34:58.493 --> 34:59.691
You got a better idea?

35:04.457 --> 35:06.366
Blows like that all the time.

35:10.838 --> 35:13.875
You can get lost a dozen feet
from your own doorstep.

35:14.050 --> 35:15.674
The wind comes up suddenly.

35:21.265 --> 35:23.222
Magnetic storm.

35:24.727 --> 35:27.015
That means the wind'll really rip soon.

35:30.065 --> 35:32.188
Dance with me.

35:42.285 --> 35:44.610
- Would you like to dance?
- No...

35:52.002 --> 35:55.003
I'm sorry, l...
I guess it must be the dust.

35:56.256 --> 35:58.582
That's the way it is on Rigel...

35:58.926 --> 36:00.586
...all the time.

36:12.772 --> 36:15.263
- Hey.
- Go away.

36:15.441 --> 36:17.019
I'm cutting in.

36:17.193 --> 36:18.936
Not on me.

36:28.787 --> 36:30.946
What's the matter with you?

36:32.749 --> 36:36.747
Why don't you just run a raffle,
and the loser gets me.

36:38.880 --> 36:41.288
You can't go out there,
you'll get killed!

36:41.466 --> 36:44.135
Just have those crystals
here when I get back.

37:27.051 --> 37:28.794
Eve!

37:31.305 --> 37:32.336
Eve!

37:59.624 --> 38:00.655
Captain's log.

38:00.875 --> 38:03.544
Have transported aboard
the Enterprise to implement search

38:03.711 --> 38:05.869
with infrared scanners
and sensing systems.

38:06.046 --> 38:08.964
Magnetic storms on the planet's
surface are cutting down speed

38:09.133 --> 38:10.757
and efficiency of our equipment.

38:10.926 --> 38:14.710
Search now in progress
for three hours, 18 minutes.

38:14.888 --> 38:17.260
Traverse parallel three and four.

38:17.432 --> 38:19.176
Checking...

38:19.726 --> 38:20.889
...but not getting much.

38:21.061 --> 38:23.765
The storm is ionizing
the atmosphere, captain.

38:23.938 --> 38:25.646
Getting difficult to probe through it.

38:25.815 --> 38:29.149
Captain, this is draining
our batteries further.

38:29.402 --> 38:32.189
- If we only had those crystals.
- But we don't!

38:32.363 --> 38:35.447
I didn't get any.
I should have found a way.

38:35.616 --> 38:36.897
Satisfied, Mr. Scott?

38:38.661 --> 38:40.867
Losing communications
with the miners, sir.

38:41.038 --> 38:42.912
Magnetic storm seems worse.

38:43.082 --> 38:44.706
Has Childress reported in yet?

38:44.875 --> 38:46.702
No, sir.
He and the girl are still missing.

38:53.091 --> 38:54.751
Sorry, Scotty.

38:56.344 --> 38:59.096
- How much power do we have left?
- About five hours, sir.

39:52.773 --> 39:53.971
Captain's log.

39:54.149 --> 39:56.557
I've expended all
but 43 minutes of power.

39:56.860 --> 39:58.438
Ship's condition, critical.

39:58.612 --> 40:02.027
Search now in progress
seven hours, 31 minutes.

40:02.282 --> 40:04.951
Magnetic storms are easing.

40:05.118 --> 40:06.577
Infrared reading.

40:06.744 --> 40:11.702
Check traverse three, grid 0-4-0.

40:11.874 --> 40:14.661
About 11 miles, bearing 1-2-1
from the mining company.

40:14.835 --> 40:18.085
- That's Ben Childress' quarters.
- There's a heat unit operating there.

40:18.255 --> 40:19.999
- It could be a cookstove.
- Have Mudd meet me

40:20.174 --> 40:21.716
- in the Transporter Room.
- Mudd?

40:21.884 --> 40:24.090
The name of this game.

40:54.665 --> 40:56.207
I had things where I wanted them.

40:56.375 --> 40:59.329
I ate some of your food,
so I paid with some chores.

41:02.547 --> 41:04.540
And I do my own cooking.

41:05.550 --> 41:06.713
Damn!

41:11.890 --> 41:14.725
Now, I've not laid a hand on you.
Remember that.

41:16.394 --> 41:20.059
The sound of male ego.
You travel halfway across the galaxy,

41:20.231 --> 41:22.556
and it's still the same song.

41:23.067 --> 41:24.182
There.

41:24.360 --> 41:26.352
You gonna eat or talk?

41:27.363 --> 41:31.656
I guess I'm supposed to sit,
taste it, roll my eyes, and,

41:31.825 --> 41:33.901
"Oh, female cooking again."

41:49.384 --> 41:52.254
I've tasted better, by my own hand.

41:52.762 --> 41:54.589
Well, you're tasting some of it now.

41:54.764 --> 41:57.848
I couldn't scrape three layers
of your leavings out of that pan.

41:58.017 --> 42:01.018
You find me a well,
some decent water, then talk.

42:02.563 --> 42:05.564
Well, why don't you hang
your pan out in the wind

42:05.941 --> 42:08.942
and let the sand blast it clean?

42:09.152 --> 42:11.228
Or hadn't you thought about that?

42:37.513 --> 42:39.137
It might work.

42:47.647 --> 42:50.482
- This solitaire?
- Double jack.

42:52.902 --> 42:54.811
The red eight ought to
go on the black nine.

42:55.655 --> 42:57.943
Not in double jack.

43:01.494 --> 43:05.242
You're not only plain as an old bucket,
you're not even good company.

43:07.541 --> 43:09.498
What the devil happened
to your looks anyway?

43:10.294 --> 43:13.164
I got tired of you. I slumped.

43:13.422 --> 43:14.750
You hear what I said?

43:14.923 --> 43:16.121
You're homely!

43:16.299 --> 43:21.092
I've got enough in crystals already
to buy queens by the gross!

43:23.181 --> 43:24.260
I didn't touch her.

43:25.016 --> 43:27.139
Thank heaven you found her.

43:27.310 --> 43:30.227
She's been bubbling
with gratitude ever since.

43:31.063 --> 43:32.474
Sit down.

43:34.650 --> 43:36.025
Tell him.

43:36.193 --> 43:37.937
Tell him, Harry.

43:39.488 --> 43:40.982
Yes, well...

43:41.156 --> 43:43.279
The Venus drugs, Harry.

43:44.368 --> 43:46.444
Venus drug?

43:46.620 --> 43:48.612
I've heard of it, but...

43:48.872 --> 43:50.366
It's not just one of those stories?

43:50.874 --> 43:52.701
Oh, it exists...

43:52.876 --> 43:53.955
...illegally.

43:54.210 --> 43:57.793
Well, actually, you see,
it's a relatively harmless drug.

43:57.964 --> 43:59.209
Harmless?

43:59.507 --> 44:00.538
Yeah...

44:00.717 --> 44:05.758
Well, what it does is give you
more of whatever you have.

44:05.930 --> 44:10.390
Well, with men, it makes them
more muscular. Women...

44:10.559 --> 44:11.674
...rounder.

44:11.852 --> 44:14.557
Men, more aggressive.
Women, more feminine and...

44:14.730 --> 44:17.600
He gave it to the women
before you met them.

44:17.775 --> 44:19.732
Does that mean the others?

44:20.694 --> 44:22.318
They really look like she does?

44:22.487 --> 44:24.895
- Mr. Childress, l...
- Is that what it means?

44:25.240 --> 44:27.031
Yes, that's what it means.

44:31.621 --> 44:33.245
What happened to my partners?

44:33.414 --> 44:35.740
They've left for their quarters
during the storm, Childress.

44:35.917 --> 44:37.292
They're married.

44:37.460 --> 44:39.084
Subspace radio marriage.

44:42.923 --> 44:44.038
It was a fraud.

44:44.216 --> 44:47.087
- They can get out of it.
- If they want to.

44:48.220 --> 44:49.418
Why?

44:49.596 --> 44:52.597
- You can't condemn the women.
- I can.

44:53.642 --> 44:55.931
A man goes out and fights...

44:56.103 --> 44:58.309
...almost dies.

44:58.480 --> 45:00.971
We all almost died.

45:01.149 --> 45:03.770
We should have, but we didn't.

45:04.068 --> 45:06.820
And now that we've got
the good life in our hands,

45:07.030 --> 45:10.979
- you bring us women for wives that...
- You don't want wives.

45:11.784 --> 45:13.824
You want this.

45:13.995 --> 45:16.153
This is what you want,
Mr. Childress.

45:17.331 --> 45:21.459
I hope you remember it and dream
about it, because you can't have it.

45:21.627 --> 45:23.454
It's not real!

45:55.451 --> 45:57.906
Is this the kind of wife
you want, Ben?

45:59.454 --> 46:01.992
Not someone to help you.

46:02.332 --> 46:05.997
Not a wife to cook and sew...

46:06.169 --> 46:09.620
...and cry and need.

46:10.757 --> 46:13.248
This kind.

46:16.054 --> 46:18.212
Selfish,

46:19.015 --> 46:20.213
vain,

46:20.391 --> 46:21.671
useless.

46:22.643 --> 46:25.134
Is this what you really want?

46:25.938 --> 46:27.646
All right, then...

46:27.815 --> 46:29.475
...here it is.

46:30.692 --> 46:32.151
Quite a woman, eh, Childress?

46:34.363 --> 46:35.940
A fake.

46:36.740 --> 46:38.199
Pumped up by a drug.

46:38.408 --> 46:40.365
By herself.

46:40.827 --> 46:43.033
She took no drug.

46:43.872 --> 46:45.070
I swallowed it.

46:45.248 --> 46:46.446
Coloured gelatine.

46:48.126 --> 46:52.586
Yes, they took away my drug
and substituted that.

46:54.965 --> 46:56.376
But that can't be.

46:56.550 --> 46:58.210
There's only one kind of woman.

46:58.385 --> 47:00.129
Or man, for that matter.

47:00.304 --> 47:02.427
You either believe in yourself...

47:02.598 --> 47:04.306
...or you don't.

47:06.518 --> 47:09.223
All right, Childress,
I've gone as far with you as I intend to.

47:09.396 --> 47:12.729
I want those lithium crystals,
and I want them now.

47:15.527 --> 47:17.104
Enterprise, this is Kirk.

47:17.278 --> 47:20.196
- Spock here, captain.
- Stand by.

47:21.449 --> 47:22.943
Do I beam down a search party?

47:23.785 --> 47:25.243
No.

47:25.411 --> 47:26.739
The...

47:26.913 --> 47:28.988
The crystals are here...

47:29.623 --> 47:30.904
...and you're welcome to them.

47:31.417 --> 47:33.208
Stand by, Mr. Spock.

47:33.377 --> 47:35.619
We're coming aboard
with the lithium crystals.

47:35.796 --> 47:37.290
How many coming, captain?

47:37.464 --> 47:39.124
Eve will stay.

47:41.093 --> 47:43.630
The day at least. We...

47:44.930 --> 47:46.472
We wanna talk.

47:47.932 --> 47:49.427
Eve?

47:54.397 --> 47:58.145
You've got someone
up there called the Enterprise.

48:00.361 --> 48:02.650
Two of us, Mr. Spock.

48:02.822 --> 48:04.565
Come on, Mr. Mudd.

48:07.451 --> 48:09.776
Don't you think you could
possibly, by accident,

48:09.953 --> 48:11.661
arrange to leave me behind here?

48:11.830 --> 48:13.988
On this planet, that would
be punishment enough.

48:14.166 --> 48:15.790
I can't do that, Harry.

48:15.959 --> 48:19.707
But I will appear as a character
witness at your trial...

48:19.879 --> 48:21.872
...if you think that'll help.

48:22.048 --> 48:24.207
They'll throw away the key.

48:34.310 --> 48:37.892
That must have been quite
a talk you made down there.

48:38.063 --> 48:41.064
Ever try considering
the patent medicine business?

48:41.233 --> 48:43.142
Why should I work
your side of the street?

48:43.318 --> 48:45.311
I'm happy the affair is over.

48:45.487 --> 48:48.488
A most annoying, emotional episode.

48:48.657 --> 48:51.148
Smack right in the old heart.

48:51.326 --> 48:52.489
Oh, I'm sorry.

48:52.661 --> 48:55.745
In your case, it would be about here.

48:56.289 --> 48:59.824
The fact that my internal arrangement
differs from yours, doctor,

49:00.126 --> 49:01.953
pleases me no end.

49:04.505 --> 49:07.541
Course plotted,
and all systems in operation.

49:08.384 --> 49:11.504
Engines engaged. Helm answering.

49:13.889 --> 49:15.929
Out of orbit, sir.

49:16.100 --> 49:17.926
Ahead full.

49:18.810 --> 49:20.933
Ahead full, sir.

49:21.305 --> 49:27.717
