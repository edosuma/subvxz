00:22.320 --> 00:23.880
Mr Samuel?

00:25.120 --> 00:27.159
Mr Samuel?

00:27.160 --> 00:28.888
You need treatment.

00:30.200 --> 00:31.840
You've been hit.

01:02.200 --> 01:05.880
Hallelujah!

01:10.360 --> 01:12.600
As I always say.

01:15.240 --> 01:18.079
I said they were going mad
here but now...

01:18.080 --> 01:20.353
there's nothing to do.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.879
You need to sit still, Mr Samuel,
till they get you to hospital.

01:23.880 --> 01:25.759
I'm perfectly fine.

01:33.080 --> 01:35.599
They're just going to clean out
the wound and check there's

01:35.600 --> 01:37.519
nothing else wrong.

01:37.520 --> 01:39.639
Don't let that man
back in the hospital.

01:39.640 --> 01:42.095
I'll do my best, Mr Samuel.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.520
Dad?

01:50.800 --> 01:52.440
Dad?

01:53.880 --> 01:55.759
Dad?

01:55.760 --> 01:59.233
You've been asleep for
nearly two days now, dear.

01:59.234 --> 02:03.439
- Are you feeling any better?
- I'm not sure quite yet.

02:03.440 --> 02:06.359
An airman went berserk,
that's what they say,

02:06.360 --> 02:08.079
at the airfield.

02:08.080 --> 02:09.999
Is that what they're saying?

02:10.000 --> 02:12.039
But you're safely back with us.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.119
And you'll be home very soon.

02:14.120 --> 02:18.279
Mr Petrukhin... Mr Petrukhin?

02:18.280 --> 02:19.919
You have an infection.

02:19.920 --> 02:21.885
We need to get more
antibiotics into you,

02:21.886 --> 02:24.919
which means you'll need
to stay with us a few...

02:24.920 --> 02:27.919
- I'd like to see him. You can't see.
- Him, you cannot visit him,

02:27.920 --> 02:31.079
no visitors are allowed to see him,
you cannot see him!

02:31.080 --> 02:34.879
It is imperative that I see him!
I have something to tell him!

02:34.880 --> 02:36.608
You cannot see him!

02:38.200 --> 02:40.359
I think he can smell it.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.633
I'm sure he can smell it.

02:43.400 --> 02:46.559
I managed to smuggle one in.

02:46.560 --> 02:49.559
I thought a quick munch on some
really ripe French cheese,

02:49.560 --> 02:51.759
and Samuel will be up
and about in no time.

02:51.760 --> 02:53.439
I told him it's your
favourite thing.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.959
Almost - you're forgetting the wine.

02:55.960 --> 02:57.599
That'll be coming soon.

02:57.600 --> 03:00.119
It's very good of you to visit him.

03:00.120 --> 03:03.519
No, don't be silly.
We love your father, we all do.

03:03.520 --> 03:06.339
- He's a unique fellow.
- He is.

03:07.120 --> 03:10.119
Seemingly old-fashioned
but modern on the inside,

03:10.120 --> 03:12.211
isn't he?

03:15.040 --> 03:18.039
I can't help thinking that soon
all hospitals will be full

03:18.040 --> 03:19.959
of his bleeper.

03:19.960 --> 03:25.870
In fact, I must make a note to speak
to the doctors here about it.

03:29.640 --> 03:31.277
What's that clock?

03:32.000 --> 03:33.679
The clock!

03:33.680 --> 03:36.239
I'm not sure I should tell you.

03:36.240 --> 03:40.319
Knowing how worried
you are about bombs and rockets.

03:40.320 --> 03:43.799
This... is the Doomsday Clock.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.799
The Doomsday Clock?

03:45.800 --> 03:47.479
That does sound worrying.

03:47.480 --> 03:49.639
Yes, well, that's the whole idea.

03:49.640 --> 03:53.079
Scientists each year calculate
how close we are

03:53.080 --> 03:54.999
to midnight - nuclear war.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.239
This year it's three
minutes to midnight.

03:58.240 --> 04:00.999
Three minutes?!

04:01.000 --> 04:06.679
It's our job, all of us,
to push the hands back a little,

04:06.680 --> 04:09.279
to, say, 12 minutes to midnight.

04:09.280 --> 04:13.559
Or 1030. That would be even
better, wouldn't it?

04:13.560 --> 04:17.560
It would.
1030 would be even better, Hannah.

04:18.440 --> 04:21.918
Well, your face is lighting up,
old chap, as you eat that,

04:21.920 --> 04:23.557
which is splendid.

04:25.200 --> 04:29.639
- Come on, darling. Yes. Yes,
- we mustn't take up too much time.

04:29.640 --> 04:32.731
I just want to tell you something.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.919
Don't say anything about your search
for Anthony on the telephone

04:35.920 --> 04:39.648
at home. Not if you want it
to be private.

04:40.160 --> 04:43.359
I think the secret service
is listening in.

04:43.360 --> 04:46.519
Listening in?
To us? Why would they do that?

04:46.520 --> 04:50.079
I think you may be
exaggerating, Samuel.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.959
The shock of the cheese perhaps.

04:51.960 --> 04:53.400
I mean it.

04:54.680 --> 04:57.953
I just... thought I'd tell you that.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.999
Hello, Samuel.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.399
It's good to see you.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.439
They nearly got you, didn't they?

05:11.440 --> 05:13.319
Yes.

05:13.320 --> 05:16.199
Thank you for warning me.

05:16.200 --> 05:19.655
I'm not going to let
that happen again.

05:47.640 --> 05:50.095
It's too late for visitors.

05:50.640 --> 05:52.519
I'll call the nurse -
you'll be thrown out.

05:52.520 --> 05:55.559
There's no need for that.
I will be very brief.

05:55.560 --> 05:58.519
I just wanted to let you know
we're putting a 24-hour guard

05:58.520 --> 06:02.159
on your house.
Your factory will be watched, too.

06:02.160 --> 06:05.799
We're not convinced the young man
who did the shooting

06:05.800 --> 06:07.319
was acting on his own.

06:07.320 --> 06:12.502
We will do our very best to keep
you and your family safe.

06:13.080 --> 06:17.399
I involved you in all this.
I feel... responsible for putting

06:17.400 --> 06:19.639
you in danger -
for you getting shot, in fact.

06:19.640 --> 06:22.159
And yet you managed to miss it all?

06:22.160 --> 06:25.759
You went to take an urgent phone
call at exactly the right moment,

06:25.760 --> 06:30.579
- didn't you, Mr Field?
- It was extremely lucky, yes.

06:30.920 --> 06:35.102
We must both make sure
we continue to be lucky.

06:38.359 --> 06:41.328
- Mrs Shaw? Mike Spearman here.
- Yes?

06:41.329 --> 06:44.519
I just wanted to let you know
that I've completed the interviews

06:44.520 --> 06:46.919
for the residents of Ardmore Road,
and I couldn't get any

06:46.920 --> 06:49.679
more information about the men
in the blue car who may have torn

06:49.680 --> 06:53.159
- down the posters of Anthony.
- I see, right.

06:53.160 --> 06:57.119
But... an elderly gentleman
did give me a forwarding address

06:57.120 --> 07:00.199
for a resident of Number 14,
and he thought it's possible

07:00.200 --> 07:03.279
more than one person went
to this address from Number 14.

07:03.280 --> 07:05.279
It's in South London, it's...

07:05.280 --> 07:07.839
No, don't give me the address.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.839
- I'll come and see you this afternoon.
- But I...

07:10.840 --> 07:14.295
I will come and
see you this afternoon.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.759
More news about Anthony?

07:17.760 --> 07:22.719
It's another possible address.
I mustn't get too excited.

07:22.720 --> 07:24.479
But it's another lead.

07:24.480 --> 07:27.187
Well, you won't go rushing
to the press now.

07:27.188 --> 07:29.519
Rushing? It's hardly rushing
after all this time.

07:29.520 --> 07:33.599
No, I shouldn't have said that,
it was silly, I'm sorry.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.839
Maybe it's best not to, isn't it?

07:35.840 --> 07:40.199
All that public exposure,
the shame of it - all kinds

07:40.200 --> 07:43.399
of questions could be fired at us,
and we're both so ignorant,

07:43.400 --> 07:45.679
aren't we?

07:45.680 --> 07:49.799
We're both so completely
ignorant, aren't we, Kathleen?

07:49.800 --> 07:54.239
Barnabas Minor?

07:54.240 --> 07:56.759
Do you want to know
what I think it is?

07:56.760 --> 08:00.919
I think you have some English
history stuck down your trousers,

08:00.920 --> 08:02.999
Barnabas Minor, do you?

08:03.000 --> 08:04.839
No, sir.

08:04.840 --> 08:07.639
Do you know what
the punishment is for lying?

08:07.640 --> 08:09.919
Two strokes, sir? Two strokes?!

08:09.920 --> 08:11.559
Two strokes?!

08:11.560 --> 08:16.106
Certainly not! It's ten strokes -
absolute minimum!

08:20.040 --> 08:23.439
Unless I approve of the history
you've sneaked in.

08:23.440 --> 08:25.319
Who have you got down there?

08:25.320 --> 08:26.919
Edward the Confessor?

08:26.920 --> 08:29.319
Edward the Confessor?!

08:29.320 --> 08:31.199
There's even men in the garden.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.759
It is to keep us safe, they said -

08:32.760 --> 08:35.639
just in case that madman
at the airbase had an accomplice.

08:35.640 --> 08:39.919
We're not safe here, Miriam.
Hannah, can you come here, please?

08:39.919 --> 08:42.799
Does anyone know
what he was confessing to?

08:42.799 --> 08:44.879
Does anyone out there have any idea?

08:44.880 --> 08:47.799
For the safety of the family,
I want the following to happen.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.799
Sasha will go back to school -
I've spoken to the headmaster,

08:50.800 --> 08:53.559
and because of what's happened to
me, Sasha will not be punished.

08:53.560 --> 08:54.639
Well, thank God for that.

08:54.640 --> 08:57.726
And we all have to be split up -
each of us has to be in a separate place.

08:57.727 --> 08:59.879
Whatever for? Surely
the family ought to be together.

08:59.880 --> 09:03.119
It's only for a few days,
until I have more information.

09:03.120 --> 09:05.479
I promise this is
for the best, Miriam.

09:05.480 --> 09:08.119
You must go and stay with your
sister. And leave you?

09:08.120 --> 09:11.759
I won't do that, I won't agree
to that, Samuel. You must do this.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.839
I can't explain yet
why it's so important,

09:13.840 --> 09:15.479
but you must.

09:15.480 --> 09:18.439
And, Hannah, you have a new friend
that you've been staying with -

09:18.440 --> 09:20.559
who is it? Come on!

09:20.560 --> 09:22.399
It's Esther Davies from the factory.

09:22.400 --> 09:25.039
Esther? Good Lord, you've been
staying with Esther!

09:25.040 --> 09:26.959
Well, they'd never look for you
there, at least.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.159
And where are you going to be?

09:28.160 --> 09:30.839
I haven't decided yet.
Not here, certainly.

09:30.840 --> 09:32.879
I've never tried
to disappear before.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.919
There's a big party at Hampstead
tomorrow night.

09:34.920 --> 09:36.025
Should I not go to it?

09:36.026 --> 09:37.814
No, go to that -
that will be perfectly safe.

09:37.815 --> 09:39.839
I don't - understand.
How can we be in danger

09:39.840 --> 09:42.879
here when we're surrounded by the
secret service, for goodness' sake?

09:42.880 --> 09:44.519
That's what I've got to find out.

09:44.520 --> 09:48.479
So, it's goodnight from me,
and it's go away, Barney.

09:48.480 --> 09:52.026
More quickly than that.
Go away, Barney!

10:03.240 --> 10:05.720
Please, please...

10:07.800 --> 10:12.437
It's good to see you all,
but, please, back to work.

10:17.080 --> 10:20.815
It's possible, just possible,
that my family is in danger.

10:20.816 --> 10:23.279
What?! But they got the guy
who did the shooting.

10:23.280 --> 10:25.719
I know, but that might not
be the end of it.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.359
Who else is involved, then?

10:27.360 --> 10:30.359
But you'll not be in any further
danger because I've told you

10:30.360 --> 10:32.359
nothing, and I need to keep it
like that.

10:32.360 --> 10:33.679
You can't keep it like that.

10:33.680 --> 10:36.799
I promise you,
this is the safest course.

10:36.800 --> 10:40.559
- I have to disappear for a few days.
- Disappear? How are you going to

10:40.560 --> 10:42.839
do that? You have no idea
how to do that.

10:42.840 --> 10:45.759
I know, but I have to give it a try,
while I work out

10:45.760 --> 10:48.397
what's in our best interests.

10:48.840 --> 10:51.399
Do not trust Mr Field.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.359
Do not answer his calls.

10:53.360 --> 10:56.399
- And do not let him in here.
- Right.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.040
I won't.

11:01.880 --> 11:05.517
We will find a way
out of this, Courtney.

11:05.920 --> 11:09.830
I'm just stepping out
for a moment, Shirley.

11:10.320 --> 11:14.159
Hello, Manytone Electrics.
Mr Petrukhin, yeah, he's just...

11:14.160 --> 11:17.359
- Is he there or not?
- Mrs Shaw?

11:17.360 --> 11:19.439
Sam, there you are.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.319
I need to talk to you,

11:21.320 --> 11:22.720
in person.

11:30.480 --> 11:33.662
I'm sorry, I can't understand that.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.439
I can't understand!

11:36.440 --> 11:39.280
I told you, I can't understand!

11:41.320 --> 11:42.640
Excuse me!

11:45.400 --> 11:49.519
Don't look like that, Sasha.
You'll be all right back at school.

11:49.520 --> 11:51.319
There'll be no punishment.

11:51.320 --> 11:53.839
The headmaster has told your
father that.

11:53.840 --> 11:55.832
But maybe they'll change their mind.

11:55.833 --> 11:58.110
They - certainly won't
change their mind,

11:58.111 --> 12:00.719
not after what's happened
to your father.

12:00.720 --> 12:04.439
But it's very important, Sasha,
that you keep out of trouble,

12:04.440 --> 12:06.039
any sort of trouble.

12:06.040 --> 12:08.399
We have enough to worry
about at the moment.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.840
Understand?

12:22.280 --> 12:24.239
Back here again, are you?

12:24.240 --> 12:27.059
Want to tell us about it, lady?

12:30.280 --> 12:32.479
This is so strange, Esther.

12:32.480 --> 12:37.117
Setting off for a ball tonight
seems so unnecessary.

12:37.400 --> 12:42.399
That's why - and don't say no,
please don't say no -

12:42.400 --> 12:45.679
that's why I want you
to come with me.

12:45.680 --> 12:48.400
Say yes. Please say yes!

12:50.880 --> 12:54.119
They won't let you in?
Yes, they will.

12:54.120 --> 12:57.559
They're frightened
of me now, remember?

12:57.560 --> 12:59.719
And I've brought you a dress.

12:59.720 --> 13:02.993
That's why I've got so much luggage.

13:14.640 --> 13:17.599
- Yes?
- I've come to see a Mrs Shaw.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.279
I believe she's staying here.

13:19.280 --> 13:22.735
There is a lady of
that name here, yes.

13:26.240 --> 13:29.604
There's a gentleman
here for Mrs Shaw.

13:32.160 --> 13:33.879
So, there you are.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.879
This gentleman wishes
to see you, Mrs Shaw.

13:36.880 --> 13:40.079
All callers must be out of the house
by 945 at the latest.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.519
Unless they have a room, of course.

13:42.520 --> 13:44.439
Do you have one I can
have for tonight?

13:44.440 --> 13:46.799
I don't let rooms out
for one night only.

13:46.800 --> 13:49.639
So, how long is
Mrs Shaw staying for?

13:49.640 --> 13:52.913
Well, I've made
an exception for her.

13:53.640 --> 13:56.599
So I suppose I could make
a second exception.

13:56.600 --> 13:59.239
Paid for in advance,
two guineas a night.

13:59.240 --> 14:00.559
Two guineas?

14:00.560 --> 14:03.999
All rooms are single occupancy,
of course, and must contain

14:04.000 --> 14:06.999
just one individual only after 945.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.999
There are no exceptions to that.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.359
Third door on the right,
and I'll bring you your change

14:12.360 --> 14:15.199
in the morning.

14:15.200 --> 14:18.519
- I'll explain.
- Yes, I think you'll need to.

14:18.520 --> 14:21.399
And you'll need to tell me what
you're doing in a place like this.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.639
I'm here to find Anthony.

14:23.640 --> 14:27.279
Nobody's heard of him or recognised
him - not yet, anyway.

14:27.280 --> 14:30.359
- Are you hungry?
- Hungry?

14:30.360 --> 14:33.559
I could be hungry, yes.

14:33.560 --> 14:36.559
Do you... fancy some kedgeree?

14:36.560 --> 14:41.470
- It'll taste better than it looks.
- I'm sure it will.

14:42.160 --> 14:44.479
Why do you need a place
to stay tonight, Samuel?

14:44.480 --> 14:46.439
Because my house isn't
safe at the moment.

14:46.440 --> 14:50.378
Isn't safe? But they caught the man
who did the shooting, didn't they?

14:50.379 --> 14:53.619
Excuse me. I will use it later.

14:55.240 --> 14:57.919
- We need to be in private.
- Yes.

14:57.920 --> 15:00.319
They're probably all hiding
from somebody or something,

15:00.320 --> 15:02.239
don't you think?

15:02.240 --> 15:05.759
There seems to be only one plate.
Shall we use your room?

15:05.760 --> 15:08.639
Because I've inspected every inch
of mine in case by some miracle

15:08.640 --> 15:12.459
I could find a trace,
you know, of Anthony.

15:21.480 --> 15:26.319
I spent my whole life trying not
to end up in a room like this.

15:26.320 --> 15:28.519
Go on, you tuck in first.

15:28.520 --> 15:31.079
I'm just going to look for clues.
You never know.

15:31.080 --> 15:33.439
I hope you don't mind. Do you?

15:33.440 --> 15:36.359
No, no, I haven't
exactly unpacked yet.

15:36.360 --> 15:39.319
- I didn't want to bring a suitcase.
- Why?

15:39.320 --> 15:41.919
I didn't want to telegraph
I was on the move.

15:44.560 --> 15:47.919
One sock. One sock, yes.

15:47.920 --> 15:50.160
- That's a start.
- Yes.

15:54.160 --> 15:56.679
Hannah Petrukhin,
and this is Esther,

15:56.680 --> 15:58.279
Lady Esther Moncrieff.

15:58.280 --> 16:00.559
She only got in from
Paris yesterday.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.279
I managed to persuade her to come.

16:03.280 --> 16:06.599
Told you they were frightened of me.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.919
It's one of the last parties
of the season, Esther.

16:09.920 --> 16:13.239
Time's running out
for people to pair off.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.919
Hannah, there you are!

16:14.920 --> 16:17.559
We were just wondering,
weren't we, if you'd be here.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.519
We thought you might
decide to stay away.

16:19.520 --> 16:23.679
Don't worry, I wasn't going to miss
this for the world.

16:23.680 --> 16:26.953
We haven't seen you before, have we?

16:27.040 --> 16:28.559
No, you haven't.

16:28.560 --> 16:31.399
Esther has been modelling in Paris.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.799
So, Hannah, when are
you going to hold your party?

16:33.800 --> 16:37.039
- My party?
- Yes, you have to hold a party.

16:37.040 --> 16:40.559
Everybody else has,
and time's running out, isn't it?

16:40.560 --> 16:46.288
And you'll need to find a place
like this to hold it, won't you?

16:49.400 --> 16:51.679
What do you think
of it so far, Esther?

16:51.680 --> 16:53.771
Is it how you imagined?

16:57.400 --> 16:59.000
Scared of me?

17:00.320 --> 17:03.684
Scared of what's
going to happen next.

17:05.560 --> 17:08.919
I've eaten so much kedgeree!

17:08.920 --> 17:12.199
It was a very successful concoction.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.959
We're sitting on the floor,
not one clue between us and...

17:14.960 --> 17:18.199
And a single sock,
which may or may not be important.

17:18.200 --> 17:21.719
Yes. And you're not with
your children and...

17:21.720 --> 17:25.084
I've lost the only child
I'll have.

17:25.200 --> 17:29.837
That's not very successful, is it?

17:30.240 --> 17:34.119
And the whole bloody house shakes!

17:34.120 --> 17:38.519
All evening, I've been avoiding
asking you this question, Samuel,

17:38.520 --> 17:40.479
and I can't avoid it any more.

17:40.480 --> 17:43.599
Why are the secret service
listening to our phone calls?

17:43.600 --> 17:46.328
Why are they interested in us?

17:50.320 --> 17:54.319
They think that some of the people
you know may be enemies

17:54.320 --> 17:56.279
of the state.

17:56.280 --> 17:57.576
What does that mean?

17:57.577 --> 18:00.119
That some of - the people
who attend your parties,

18:00.120 --> 18:02.639
like Walter's talk about
Victorian buildings,

18:02.640 --> 18:07.199
that some of them may
have... other interests.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.079
Like what?

18:09.080 --> 18:11.799
I know most of these people -
they're friends of Richard and I.

18:11.800 --> 18:15.319
But it's complicated by the fact
that these same secret servicemen

18:15.320 --> 18:18.691
that have made the accusation
could themselves be...

18:18.692 --> 18:21.879
- enemies of the state.
- For goodness' sake!

18:21.880 --> 18:24.479
What is this, some sort
of ludicrous game,

18:24.480 --> 18:27.439
all these men accusing each other
of we-don't-know-what?

18:27.440 --> 18:29.039
Well, at least I don't know what!

18:29.040 --> 18:31.199
It is ludicrous,
but it is what is happening.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.639
Do you know what Aunt Mary said
to me the other day?

18:33.640 --> 18:36.359
She said, "We are so ignorant."

18:36.360 --> 18:39.614
She meant me and her.
And that's true.

18:39.615 --> 18:42.724
I know I don't take very much
interest in Richard's work

18:42.725 --> 18:44.734
and the day-to-day
world of politics...

18:44.735 --> 18:47.316
Like most people, like me -
you can't blame yourself for that.

18:47.317 --> 18:49.799
Yes, yes, I can. I've been

18:49.800 --> 18:52.599
so wrapped up
in our beautiful house and making

18:52.600 --> 18:55.639
the garden as stunning
as it could be, and being a dutiful

18:55.640 --> 18:58.039
wife, and I thought my
ignorance was natural -

18:58.040 --> 19:01.559
as you just said - but of course
it isn't natural at all!

19:01.560 --> 19:05.479
And maybe that's why he went,
why Anthony left,

19:05.480 --> 19:09.119
because I was so closed off from
everything in that bloody house!

19:09.120 --> 19:11.399
It can't be because of that,
it can't be that simple.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.639
Yes, yes, it can!

19:13.640 --> 19:19.119
I had Anthony when I was barely 19,
and all my energy since then,

19:19.120 --> 19:23.359
everything, has gone
into bringing him up right,

19:23.360 --> 19:28.319
encouraging his interests,
his drawing and his music.

19:28.320 --> 19:31.599
And being the perfect hostess
for all the parties we had.

19:31.600 --> 19:34.439
And I was very good at that,
I really thought I was.

19:34.440 --> 19:39.531
And that's why I carried on doing
it, even after he left.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.917
But it was all utterly wrong.

19:44.960 --> 19:46.640
Such a lie.

19:48.080 --> 19:50.599
Because it was my fault.

19:50.600 --> 19:54.328
- It is my fault.
- Well, that's not true.

19:54.640 --> 19:56.639
It's never one person's fault.

19:56.640 --> 19:59.279
I won't cry in front of you again,
once is enough, I can't.

19:59.280 --> 20:02.280
I won't do it again.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.400
No, Samuel. No, just...

20:15.760 --> 20:18.319
just hold me, please.

20:18.320 --> 20:20.279
That's it.

20:20.280 --> 20:24.008
No. No, that's not just holding me,
is it?

20:26.920 --> 20:29.319
God, Samuel.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.679
It is 950.

20:34.680 --> 20:37.319
All residents should be
in their own room by now.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.599
- Of course.
- As I told you.

20:39.600 --> 20:42.039
There are absolutely no exceptions.

20:42.040 --> 20:47.495
- Don't worry, I'm just leaving.
- We'll leave the door open.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.079
Thank God.
Thank God for the tiny woman. -

20:53.080 --> 20:55.719
Because that would only
have made things worse, wouldn't it?

20:55.720 --> 20:57.400
Goodnight, Sam.

21:09.360 --> 21:12.759
Hello, beautiful! Fancy a kiss?!

21:12.760 --> 21:14.800
Want to go up there?

21:16.560 --> 21:21.470
I hope you're signing something
really, really obscene.

21:23.440 --> 21:26.719
See that man? He knows something
about Anthony Shaw.

21:26.720 --> 21:29.239
He gave Mrs Shaw an address.

21:29.240 --> 21:32.039
Let's see if we can find out more.

21:32.040 --> 21:35.279
Mr Ledbury?
I'm a friend of Mrs Shaw's.

21:35.280 --> 21:38.799
- Yes.
- Hannah Petrukhin, and this is Esther,

21:38.800 --> 21:40.959
Lady Esther Moncrieff.

21:40.960 --> 21:43.479
You were a friend of
Anthony's, weren't you?

21:43.480 --> 21:46.239
- Anthony Shaw.
- I was.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.879
I was wondering if I might be able
to ask you a little about him.

21:48.880 --> 21:51.639
You can ask me anything you like.

21:51.640 --> 21:55.550
But a little bit later, ladies.
A bit later.

21:56.440 --> 22:00.679
Come on. I'm not letting him
get away with that.

22:00.680 --> 22:03.079
They're looking at us.

22:03.080 --> 22:06.319
Are they talking about us, I wonder.

22:06.320 --> 22:08.719
Can you read him from here?

22:08.720 --> 22:12.319
I'd love it if you can!
Eavesdropping from here!

22:12.320 --> 22:15.320
See what they're saying about us.

22:22.960 --> 22:27.233
You've got something?
What's he saying about us?

22:30.600 --> 22:33.119
He's talking about Anthony?

22:33.120 --> 22:38.848
You've got to get more of it.
What's he saying, Esther? Come on.

22:45.360 --> 22:48.919
We've got you, Paul.
We can hear what you're saying.

22:48.920 --> 22:51.800
Let me see!

22:54.320 --> 22:56.599
Is that what he's saying?

22:56.600 --> 23:01.319
They never knew what Anthony was
interested in, his parents.

23:01.320 --> 23:03.439
Never had any idea.

23:03.440 --> 23:06.399
They never knew what Anthony
was interested in.

23:06.400 --> 23:08.319
They really didn't.

23:08.320 --> 23:10.502
His parents had no idea.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.679
There you are.

23:30.680 --> 23:34.359
Yes, I was sort of hovering,
waiting till I heard you.

23:34.360 --> 23:37.780
- I've decided I'm going to go home.
- You're leaving already?

23:37.781 --> 23:38.919
Yes.

23:38.920 --> 23:41.750
I'm not going to learn anything
more from this place.

23:41.751 --> 23:44.751
There are several reasons why
it's a good idea for me to go home.

23:44.752 --> 23:45.473
Are there?

23:45.475 --> 23:46.599
- Don't you think?
- Such as?

23:46.600 --> 23:48.634
Well, Richard will be missing me,
for a start.

23:48.635 --> 23:51.719
Of course. He will be missing you, that's right.
- Yes.

23:51.720 --> 23:54.799
He hates it when I'm away from home.
Thank you last night, though,

23:54.800 --> 23:57.439
for looking after me. That was very kind of you.
- Right.

23:57.440 --> 23:59.799
I wish we'd found
more than just a sock.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.799
There's a plate missing here.

24:01.800 --> 24:05.982
It's in my room,
I was just about to return it.

24:10.080 --> 24:13.519
So, where will you go,
with your brown paper parcel?

24:13.520 --> 24:17.239
My parcel, yes.
I don't know, I have various ideas.

24:17.240 --> 24:19.439
How long do you have
to keep away from home?

24:19.440 --> 24:22.959
I'm not sure. Until I find out
who's really behind the shooting.

24:22.960 --> 24:26.199
You will be careful,
won't you, Samuel?

24:26.200 --> 24:28.840
Yes.

24:31.560 --> 24:35.439
Actually... I've thought
of where I should go.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.679
The very last place
that they would look for me.

24:37.680 --> 24:40.119
- Which is where?
- You won't tell anyone?

24:40.120 --> 24:42.639
- No-one at all?
- No, of course, of course I wouldn't.

24:42.640 --> 24:45.319
Then it's the hospital, the one
I've just been discharged from.

24:45.320 --> 24:46.140
Hospital?!

24:46.142 --> 24:48.599
Because they know
that I'm not there any more.

24:48.600 --> 24:49.959
Can you do that?

24:49.960 --> 24:53.319
Can you just book into a hospital,
like a hotel, if you're not ill?

24:53.320 --> 24:55.559
Yes. Why not?

24:55.560 --> 24:58.470
I am the bleeper man, after all.

25:02.960 --> 25:06.759
So, Petrukhin, your punishment
is postponed - whether for good,

25:06.760 --> 25:09.759
- we don't know yet, do we?
- Don't we, sir?

25:09.760 --> 25:12.599
We don't know that, no.

25:12.600 --> 25:15.479
So, what have you to say
for yourself?

25:15.480 --> 25:17.959
I'm very sorry, sir,
that I ran away.

25:17.960 --> 25:20.239
Is that all?

25:20.240 --> 25:22.639
This is our first chance to talk
since you've come back,

25:22.640 --> 25:25.639
- and that's all you have to say?
- Yes, sir.

25:25.640 --> 25:28.279
- You have nothing to ask me?
- No, sir.

25:28.280 --> 25:29.999
I think...

25:30.000 --> 25:33.519
you should be asking me
about Anthony Shaw's

25:33.520 --> 25:35.719
letters, shouldn't you?

25:35.720 --> 25:39.239
Because this is the file
you were looking at.

25:39.240 --> 25:42.786
You broke into the headmaster's
study so you could take a look at this.

25:42.787 --> 25:45.599
I only wanted to
take a look to see if there were...

25:45.600 --> 25:48.328
I know what you wanted to see.

25:49.400 --> 25:50.480
Come here.

25:54.560 --> 25:57.839
So, now you can take
a good look, Petrukhin.

25:57.840 --> 26:00.759
And, as you can see,
there are many letters

26:00.760 --> 26:04.306
from Anthony Shaw,
he wrote to me a lot.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.399
You look surprised.

26:06.400 --> 26:09.359
No, sir. I'm not surprised.

26:09.360 --> 26:13.599
And, as you can also see,
they stopped several years ago,

26:13.600 --> 26:15.600
just before he was 21.

26:16.440 --> 26:18.639
He disappeared, didn't he?

26:18.640 --> 26:21.399
- You know that, don't you?
- Yes, sir.

26:21.400 --> 26:24.040
Mrs Shaw told me.

26:25.520 --> 26:28.839
- A fine lady, is she not?
- She is, sir.

26:28.840 --> 26:32.568
I expect she was
an excellent mother, too.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.919
I'm sure we both wonder
what happened to Anthony.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.320
Yes, sir.

26:38.760 --> 26:41.306
I wonder if we'll ever know.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.039
Yes?

26:50.040 --> 26:52.559
Mrs Shaw? It's Hannah Petrukhin.

26:52.560 --> 26:55.359
- Hannah? Are you all right?
- Yes, Mrs Shaw.

26:55.360 --> 26:58.719
I get nervous now when a Petrukhin
calls me from a call box.

26:58.720 --> 27:01.359
No, nothing's wrong, Mrs Shaw.

27:01.360 --> 27:03.879
I have a friend, Esther.
We were at a party

27:03.880 --> 27:06.959
and... she learned
something about Anthony.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.439
Well, what was it?
What did she learn?

27:09.440 --> 27:11.519
I think it would be easier
if we came to see you,

27:11.520 --> 27:13.439
Mrs Shaw, if that's possible.

27:13.440 --> 27:17.077
Maybe tomorrow when
Esther's not at work.

27:17.960 --> 27:20.839
Dr Philip Jones to
Paediatrics immediately, please.

27:20.840 --> 27:25.559
So, these are the rooms for our
private patients, Mr Petrukhin.

27:25.560 --> 27:28.691
- I hope this will do.
- Absolutely.

27:28.692 --> 27:29.778
It's perfect.

27:29.779 --> 27:31.599
We will have to charge
you the same rate,

27:31.600 --> 27:34.639
- I'm afraid, as our private patients.
- Of course.

27:34.640 --> 27:37.159
I just want to be able to study
the workings of the hospital

27:37.160 --> 27:39.279
around the clock, to help
with the development

27:39.280 --> 27:41.559
of the staff locator.

27:41.560 --> 27:44.254
I'll see you around the
hospital, then, Mr Petrukhin.

27:44.255 --> 27:45.399
Yes, you will.

27:45.400 --> 27:49.039
Dr Small? You will keep the fact
that I'm staying here

27:49.040 --> 27:50.839
strictly confidential?

27:50.840 --> 27:52.799
I think everything will
work better that way,

27:52.800 --> 27:55.319
if as few people as possible
know about it.

27:55.320 --> 27:58.999
Where are you, Samuel?
You must tell me where you are.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.216
It's best you don't know.

28:00.217 --> 28:02.239
What do - you mean,
it's best I don't know?

28:02.240 --> 28:05.039
- How on Earth can that possibly be true?
- Right now it is true.

28:05.040 --> 28:06.839
I realise there's all sorts of
things

28:06.840 --> 28:09.999
you're not telling me,
I'm not that stupid!

28:10.000 --> 28:12.319
What's that noise?

28:12.320 --> 28:15.639
Are you at a train station, Samuel?
Is there somebody with you?

28:15.640 --> 28:19.186
Nobody's with me,
Miriam, of course not.

28:19.200 --> 28:22.719
Put in more money, Samuel,
you're cutting off.

28:22.720 --> 28:27.720
I don't have any more change, I'll call you...
- Samuel!

28:34.000 --> 28:36.719
Hello. There's no need to stand,
please.

28:36.720 --> 28:41.720
- Mrs Shaw, this is Esther.
- I'm delighted to meet you.

28:42.040 --> 28:44.799
You'll forgive me if I come
straight to the point.

28:44.800 --> 28:48.319
You've found something out
about Anthony, you say?

28:48.320 --> 28:51.119
We were at a party,
Mrs Shaw, and that man,

28:51.120 --> 28:53.079
Paul Ledbury, was there.

28:53.080 --> 28:55.679
And Esther can lip-read,
and she saw him saying

28:55.680 --> 29:00.719
to his friends, she saw him say,
"They never knew what he was really"

29:00.720 --> 29:03.639
"interested in, his parents."

29:03.640 --> 29:06.004
"They never had any idea."

29:08.240 --> 29:11.399
And? What did he say then?

29:11.400 --> 29:14.855
I'm afraid we didn't
find out any more.

29:16.320 --> 29:19.039
You came all the way
here to tell me that?

29:19.040 --> 29:22.677
Yes, well, we thought
it might be useful.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.239
Well... on its own
like that, it's tantalising,

29:26.240 --> 29:30.039
naturally, but how do you even know
they were talking about Anthony?

29:30.040 --> 29:32.239
Yes, they were, definitely.

29:32.240 --> 29:35.919
But you didn't catch
what he was referring to?

29:35.920 --> 29:38.039
Can't you get Paul
Ledbury to tell you?

29:38.040 --> 29:39.799
Well, yes, I could certainly try,

29:39.800 --> 29:42.399
but he's always extremely
reluctant to talk to me.

29:42.400 --> 29:47.491
Well, thank you, you're very kind
for taking the trouble.

29:47.720 --> 29:52.239
I thought perhaps, now we're here,
because Esther notices things

29:52.240 --> 29:56.839
sometimes, maybe we could have
a look at some of Anthony's things.

29:56.840 --> 29:59.240
Well... why not?

30:02.640 --> 30:04.808
I'm sorry for disturbing
you, Aunt Mary.

30:04.809 --> 30:05.759
Come in, come in.

30:05.760 --> 30:09.768
I tend to hide away here in the
afternoons and bury myself in books.

30:09.769 --> 30:12.479
- This is Esther.
- She's deaf, she can't...

30:12.480 --> 30:16.879
I see. It makes my problems
seem very small.

30:16.880 --> 30:19.759
Yes, that's one of
Anthony's pictures.

30:19.760 --> 30:22.759
He was 15 when he did that.

30:22.760 --> 30:25.199
We think they're images
of the end of the world,

30:25.200 --> 30:26.999
or of some great storm.

30:27.000 --> 30:32.728
He painted in all sorts of styles,
as children often tend to do.

30:40.560 --> 30:44.742
Horses? There aren't any horses
in the picture.

30:48.040 --> 30:50.559
Yes! Horses! So there are!

30:50.560 --> 30:55.106
You've spotted something
all the rest of us missed!

31:02.840 --> 31:05.679
I've looked at all
of these, of course.

31:05.680 --> 31:09.039
I've never seen anything
hidden in them, though.

31:09.040 --> 31:12.131
And then, of course, there's this.

31:16.440 --> 31:18.599
He spent months doing this.

31:18.600 --> 31:20.879
It's the last bit of artwork he did.

31:20.880 --> 31:25.153
It's a sort of fantasy town,
a futuristic place.

31:25.800 --> 31:29.559
All the people look
like they're frozen, don't they?

31:29.560 --> 31:34.119
Like they've been stopped moving
by some tremendous force.

31:34.120 --> 31:37.484
Maybe it's the moment
before the bomb.

31:37.840 --> 31:40.035
- What have you seen?
- Yes.

31:40.036 --> 31:41.719
There are lots of birds.

31:41.720 --> 31:43.919
He drew so much detail.

31:43.920 --> 31:46.199
There are even people
inside the aeroplane.

31:46.200 --> 31:50.019
But isn't it odd -
turkeys on the rooftops?

31:51.880 --> 31:54.119
Yes, the rabbit.

31:54.120 --> 31:56.199
Not sure I'd noticed
that one before.

31:56.200 --> 31:59.382
I think we need a magnifying glass.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.039
Esther, you've uncovered
a whole zoo!

32:02.040 --> 32:04.999
I'd noticed the birds,
but none of these.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.919
It's like a children's game
where you have to spot the tiger

32:07.920 --> 32:11.319
in the forest, but here
they're everywhere.

32:11.320 --> 32:13.279
Because he liked animals.

32:13.280 --> 32:15.399
Maybe he went to a zoo.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.439
Maybe he's been working
at a zoo all this time.

32:17.440 --> 32:19.919
But they're all farm animals.

32:19.920 --> 32:21.679
Well, maybe a farm, then.

32:21.680 --> 32:24.199
He's working at a farm
in the countryside somewhere.

32:24.200 --> 32:27.519
No, it's nothing to do
with a zoo or a farm.

32:27.520 --> 32:29.999
Can't you see what it's saying?

32:30.000 --> 32:33.559
Look at the animals
and then look at the people.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.839
Can't you see?

32:35.840 --> 32:39.719
It's about not eating animals,
that's what it's about.

32:39.720 --> 32:43.119
It's about not killing
animals for food.

32:43.120 --> 32:46.799
People are frozen,
caught in a moment of disgust

32:46.800 --> 32:49.399
because the animals have taken over!

32:49.400 --> 32:52.199
The animals are no longer meat!

32:52.200 --> 32:55.959
That's why there are so many pigs
and cows and chickens,

32:55.960 --> 32:58.399
because nobody dare
eat them any more.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.219
That can't be right.

33:01.120 --> 33:03.639
Anthony never mentioned anything
about not eating meat.

33:03.640 --> 33:05.799
But children have secrets,
don't they?

33:05.800 --> 33:08.999
This is not such a huge thing
that it had to be kept secret.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.479
Of course it didn't.

33:10.480 --> 33:12.879
We never would have stopped Anthony
from giving up meat.

33:12.880 --> 33:14.879
I don't see that in the picture.

33:14.880 --> 33:17.119
- I don't think it's that at all.
- Kathy?

33:17.120 --> 33:18.760
Where are you?

33:22.200 --> 33:24.519
It makes one so calm, doesn't it?

33:24.520 --> 33:26.799
Feeding these animals.

33:26.800 --> 33:30.710
That's why we keep them,
for precisely that.

33:31.200 --> 33:35.039
After being in Parliament all day
and having to deal with some

33:35.040 --> 33:38.799
of the ridiculously
self-important people there,

33:38.800 --> 33:40.800
to come and do this...

33:42.680 --> 33:44.679
it's blissful.

33:44.680 --> 33:47.679
Every time I see you, Hannah,
I think of something

33:47.680 --> 33:49.319
falling on us from the sky.

33:49.320 --> 33:53.230
Bit of Sputnik or a bit of bomb.

33:53.440 --> 33:56.999
- Do you still worry about that?
- Yes, all the time.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.679
And now I've seen the Doomsday
Clock, it's worse, of course.

33:59.680 --> 34:02.999
I've always been interested
in what young people are thinking.

34:03.000 --> 34:06.519
How they worry about what could
happen to our world.

34:06.520 --> 34:08.599
Its destruction.

34:08.600 --> 34:11.964
The final war that
could end all this.

35:04.880 --> 35:07.335
I think you might be right.

35:30.280 --> 35:33.439
Mr Field, what can I do for you?

35:33.440 --> 35:36.440
You can find Mr Petrukhin for me.

35:39.040 --> 35:41.759
It's good to see where
these things are made.

35:41.760 --> 35:47.124
I was always a believer,
ever since the first demonstration.

35:47.880 --> 35:51.159
- So, where is Mr Petrukhin?
- I can't tell you that.

35:51.160 --> 35:54.839
- Why ever not?
- Because he doesn't trust you.

35:54.840 --> 35:57.599
You weren't there when
the shooting happened.

35:57.600 --> 36:00.839
It really is very simple,
Mr Johnson.

36:00.840 --> 36:05.199
We need to know where Samuel
is in order to protect him.

36:05.200 --> 36:07.279
So, are you going
to tell me where he is?

36:07.280 --> 36:09.079
I'm not, no.

36:09.080 --> 36:12.279
And, as it happens, I don't know.

36:12.280 --> 36:15.159
- You don't?
- No.

36:15.160 --> 36:17.799
Well, that is a great pity
for all our sakes.

36:17.800 --> 36:20.519
I'm absolutely determined
this situation does not become even

36:20.520 --> 36:24.719
messier, Mr Johnson. I don't want
anybody else to get hurt.

36:24.720 --> 36:29.720
I certainly don't want to see
anything happen to Samuel.

36:32.480 --> 36:36.919
So, these tiny animals
are what you feel it's all about?

36:36.920 --> 36:40.466
Yes. Yes, they are.
Especially this one.

36:57.120 --> 36:59.799
I have to be honest, Mrs Shaw.

36:59.800 --> 37:02.599
I think this is a very slender lead.

37:02.600 --> 37:05.559
I've looked through all of Anthony's
drawings and paintings,

37:05.560 --> 37:08.159
as you know, and there's
all sorts of things.

37:08.160 --> 37:10.559
There's flowers and battleships...

37:10.560 --> 37:13.159
I want to follow this line of
inquiry, Mr Spearman.

37:13.160 --> 37:15.679
I think it's the nearest we've got.

37:15.680 --> 37:18.839
Have you done what I've asked you
to do? You have made enquiries?

37:18.840 --> 37:22.399
I have, yes. Today I visited the
only two vegetarian restaurants in

37:22.400 --> 37:25.639
the West End and there is no sign
of your son working there,

37:25.640 --> 37:28.079
eating there,
ever having been there.

37:28.080 --> 37:31.159
I also spoke to the Vegetarian
Society and they've had

37:31.160 --> 37:34.559
no contact with him or anybody
answering his description.

37:34.560 --> 37:36.319
I see.

37:36.320 --> 37:40.319
And what about the hotels
serving purely vegetarian food?

37:40.320 --> 37:44.319
Well, there's one on the west coast
of Scotland and there is one

37:44.320 --> 37:47.119
a little nearer in Norfolk.

37:47.120 --> 37:50.393
Do you really want me to visit them?

37:51.080 --> 37:54.639
No, I will visit the one
in Norfolk myself.

37:54.640 --> 37:59.459
I'll go there tonight.
In fact, I will go there today.

37:59.680 --> 38:02.639
Aren't you in the wrong country,
mate? What?!

38:02.640 --> 38:04.639
We'll run well out of bananas.

38:04.640 --> 38:06.759
Come over here! Leave it!

38:06.760 --> 38:09.039
You in the stupid top, come
here! They're not worth it!

38:09.040 --> 38:11.879
Go back where you belong!
Come on, mate, come try it!

38:11.880 --> 38:13.559
Get back to where you're from!

38:13.560 --> 38:17.719
We know where you are, mate.
We'll see you later.

38:17.720 --> 38:19.479
There she is.

38:19.480 --> 38:22.279
We just thought you probably
needed some company.

38:22.280 --> 38:24.679
I get by myself, you know.

38:24.680 --> 38:26.719
I've been studying, as it happens.

38:26.720 --> 38:29.359
Besides, I've got to try to get
to university, and that means

38:29.360 --> 38:32.599
I've got to get a scholarship,
so I've been quite busy, actually.

38:32.600 --> 38:35.138
Then you'll need some
distraction, won't you?

38:35.139 --> 38:37.919
Yes.
Esther's brought you a letter.

38:37.920 --> 38:40.830
It was delivered to the factory.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.919
She's living here now, you know.

38:46.920 --> 38:49.919
Esther's mum's moved in
with her boyfriend.

38:49.920 --> 38:51.719
It couldn't be better for you.

38:51.720 --> 38:53.559
It's from my friend Nicholas.

38:53.560 --> 38:55.999
He's one of the few
people I can talk to -

38:56.000 --> 38:58.919
apart from you, of course.
It's a pity.

38:58.920 --> 39:02.079
He says he's given up his novel,
but he's writing jokes now,

39:02.080 --> 39:05.639
and comedy sketches, and trying to
make his living that way.

39:05.640 --> 39:07.959
Esther, I've missed him so much.

39:07.960 --> 39:10.439
And I've so wanted to talk
to him about my father

39:10.440 --> 39:11.799
and what happened to him.

39:11.800 --> 39:15.073
I'm so worried about my dad, Esther.

39:27.520 --> 39:32.920
Samuel? Samuel? Samuel?!

39:34.680 --> 39:37.239
Samuel, it is you!

39:37.240 --> 39:38.340
Lord Wallington?

39:38.341 --> 39:40.119
Goodness sakes,
stop calling me that.

39:40.120 --> 39:42.399
Arthur, please!

39:42.400 --> 39:44.784
Did Kathleen tell
you that I was here?

39:44.785 --> 39:45.968
Kathleen? No.

39:45.970 --> 39:48.479
- Why, does she know you're here?
- I don't think so.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.599
I was just trying to work out
how you found me.

39:50.600 --> 39:52.279
No, no, nobody told me.

39:52.280 --> 39:55.639
I rang the hospital and encouraged
them to take your bellboy machine

39:55.640 --> 39:59.559
seriously, put in a word,
and they said you were here,

39:59.560 --> 40:02.413
making a study of the workings
of the hospital.

40:02.414 --> 40:05.239
I am, yes. Although very few people
know about it.

40:05.240 --> 40:09.399
Anyway, that's the reason I've come
here, to rescue you, Samuel.

40:09.400 --> 40:10.130
Rescue me?

40:10.132 --> 40:12.319
Yes, you can't be staying
another night here,

40:12.320 --> 40:13.999
eating ghastly hospital food,

40:14.000 --> 40:18.039
so, Richard and I are going to take
you out for a slap-up meal.

40:18.040 --> 40:19.679
How does that sound?

40:19.680 --> 40:23.499
And there's somebody
we'd like you to meet.

40:45.280 --> 40:49.279
I'd like a single room
for one night, please.

40:49.280 --> 40:52.735
- You haven't booked?
- I have not, no.

40:52.880 --> 40:56.699
If you could sign your name,
please, madam.

41:07.320 --> 41:12.519
So, Mrs Milton, you do realise
this hotel serves only

41:12.520 --> 41:16.279
- vegetarian food at all meals?
- I do, yes.

41:16.280 --> 41:19.159
And no meat can be brought
into the hotel in either

41:19.160 --> 41:22.319
- sandwiches or snacks.
- I understand.

41:22.320 --> 41:23.719
Good.

41:23.720 --> 41:26.199
Not everybody appreciates that.

41:26.200 --> 41:28.479
How did you come to hear about us?

41:28.480 --> 41:30.571
The Vegetarian Society.

41:31.360 --> 41:35.724
- Are you a member?
- No, but I am about to join.

41:37.680 --> 41:40.226
It's a nice room, thank you.

41:41.400 --> 41:43.999
Are there several young men
of your age working at this hotel?

41:44.000 --> 41:46.439
There are a few, yes, madam.

41:46.440 --> 41:50.039
- And have you worked here long?
- Two years, madam.

41:50.040 --> 41:52.239
Is there anything else, madam?

41:52.240 --> 41:53.799
No, not at the moment.

41:53.800 --> 41:55.080
Thank you.

42:17.400 --> 42:21.159
So, Samuel, meet our
very distinguished dining companion,

42:21.160 --> 42:25.799
- Sir Reginald Maddox, the general.
- Yes, you're the inventor chap.

42:25.800 --> 42:28.599
- Delighted to meet you.
- I say...

42:28.600 --> 42:30.639
Now everyone's looking at us.

42:30.640 --> 42:34.039
Richard does have that effect
on people almost wherever he goes.

42:34.040 --> 42:35.959
Not everywhere, that's rubbish.

42:35.960 --> 42:37.799
Not in Parliament, certainly.

42:37.800 --> 42:40.839
We need a screen put around us,
don't we?

42:40.840 --> 42:45.679
So, do you have your bellboy
pager thing on you?

42:45.680 --> 42:48.439
I do, as it happens.
I never go anywhere without it.

42:52.320 --> 42:56.320
Funny-looking thing.
Bloody useful, I expect.

42:56.360 --> 42:59.559
- I hear you got shot at.
- Yes, at an airbase.

42:59.560 --> 43:02.319
- Two people were killed, in fact.
- Nasty business.

43:02.320 --> 43:05.599
It was an awful business.
Let's banish it, shall we,

43:05.600 --> 43:07.510
order some champagne.

43:21.560 --> 43:23.919
- The menu, madam.
- Thank you.

43:23.920 --> 43:27.011
There's no special tonight, madam.

43:41.880 --> 43:43.790
The wine list, madam.

43:54.240 --> 43:58.199
We were shown this absurd government
film, warning children what to do

43:58.200 --> 43:59.799
during a nuclear attack.

43:59.800 --> 44:03.279
It consisted of hiding
under their desks at school

44:03.280 --> 44:05.919
- with their hands on their heads.
- Duck and cover.

44:05.920 --> 44:07.719
There's even a little song.

44:13.240 --> 44:15.439
Yes, my daughter's always
talking about this film.

44:15.440 --> 44:18.079
Samuel has the most
delightful daughter.

44:18.080 --> 44:19.639
I showed her the Doomsday Clock.

44:19.640 --> 44:21.199
She's rather obsessed by it now.

44:21.200 --> 44:24.239
Yes, she's interested in most
things. She's always reading.

44:24.240 --> 44:26.039
Yes, books.

44:26.040 --> 44:30.999
You know the play by Shakespeare
about the mad Scottish general?

44:31.000 --> 44:33.310
What's it called?
The one with the witches.

44:33.311 --> 44:34.893
- Macbeth.
- No.

44:34.895 --> 44:39.079
- No? There's another one, is - there?
- What'd you say? Macbeth?

44:39.080 --> 44:42.399
Yes, that's it. Well, you know at
the end there's a wood that moves?

44:42.400 --> 44:45.079
He's told there's nothing to worry
about until a wood moves,

44:45.080 --> 44:48.439
- and then a wood does move.
- When Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane.

44:48.440 --> 44:49.879
That's right.

44:49.880 --> 44:55.199
Because all the soldiers carry trees
and bushes in front of them.

44:55.200 --> 44:58.239
Well, I have a wood that can move.

44:58.240 --> 45:00.279
Well, that's hardly possible,
is it, Reginald?

45:00.280 --> 45:03.919
- The general has a wood that moves.
- I bloody well have,

45:03.920 --> 45:06.193
and it's not in Scotland.

45:06.880 --> 45:09.799
And it'll freeze their blood.

45:09.800 --> 45:13.399
Coming out of the night,
coming straight at them.

45:13.400 --> 45:16.319
- Freeze whose blood?
- Well, the fucking Russians, naturally.

45:16.320 --> 45:17.879
They're absolutely everywhere.

45:17.880 --> 45:20.799
They've burrowed their way into all
sorts of places in this country.

45:20.800 --> 45:22.879
And then of course
there's the fucking Jews.

45:22.880 --> 45:24.879
They're running everything again.

45:24.880 --> 45:27.399
Taken them no time at all to get
back to where they always were.

45:27.400 --> 45:28.879
Reginald!

45:28.880 --> 45:31.239
Samuel is Jewish.

45:31.240 --> 45:35.639
Now, you must take that back immediately.
What?

45:35.640 --> 45:38.319
Are you? Well, I mean...

45:38.320 --> 45:40.999
you're not, of course, like them.
I mean...

45:41.000 --> 45:43.879
Well, you sell things
to deaf people for a start.

45:43.880 --> 45:47.199
You're not just about making money
and getting everything for yourself.

45:47.200 --> 45:49.319
And you're not a recent
immigrant, are you?

45:49.320 --> 45:52.759
Reginald, you don't want Samuel
to think you're some sort of

45:52.760 --> 45:54.639
grotesque, old dinosaur, do you?

45:54.640 --> 45:56.359
Certainly not.

45:56.360 --> 45:59.880
Because, actually,
I'm not that at all.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.479
Now, let's talk
about your invention,

46:05.480 --> 46:07.879
because I think I'm able
to help you get some people

46:07.880 --> 46:10.479
interested in it.
You must tell me how it works.

46:10.480 --> 46:13.320
I will. In a moment.

46:14.840 --> 46:16.599
Where are you going?

46:16.600 --> 46:18.360
Just the cloakroom.

46:33.840 --> 46:38.039
- Samuel, the general has to go.
- Yes, I've just been given a message.

46:38.040 --> 46:39.679
I've been called away.

46:39.680 --> 46:44.079
Even at my age, there's sudden
urgent business to attend to.

46:44.080 --> 46:45.999
Marvellous meeting you.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.455
We'll meet again, I'm sure.

46:49.800 --> 46:52.279
The old bastard still doesn't know
how to behave, does he?

46:52.280 --> 46:54.279
He certainly doesn't, no.

46:54.280 --> 46:56.079
Don't worry about him.

46:56.080 --> 46:58.839
And certainly not about
his horrible views.

46:58.840 --> 47:01.919
- He's hardly a close friend of ours.
- Definitely not.

47:01.920 --> 47:05.159
But I wanted you to meet him,
because he's still very influential

47:05.160 --> 47:06.639
in military circles.

47:06.640 --> 47:10.839
He could get all the Armed Forces
to take the bleeper.

47:10.840 --> 47:14.119
Today, he was having a little bit
of a lapse, though.

47:14.120 --> 47:17.999
- More than a little.
- Absolutely, more than a little.

47:18.000 --> 47:22.479
So, now we must make amends
and have a riotous night.

47:22.480 --> 47:24.919
And you're going to come and stay
with me, aren't you,

47:24.920 --> 47:26.359
in my rather cosy London flat?

47:26.360 --> 47:29.199
No, that's very kind of you,
but it's totally unnecessary.

47:29.200 --> 47:31.999
We can't have you mouldering
away in a hospital room, can we?

47:32.000 --> 47:36.119
Besides, Kathleen's away
and I need the company.

47:36.120 --> 47:38.680
Please. Please, come.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.879
Excuse me.

47:47.880 --> 47:50.639
You don't know this man, do you?

47:50.640 --> 47:52.959
He never came here, did he?

47:52.960 --> 47:57.415
No, madam, I've never
seen him, I don't think, no.

47:58.240 --> 48:01.513
None of you have ever seen this man?

48:02.440 --> 48:04.531
Please, look carefully.

48:05.440 --> 48:07.639
- No.
- He's Anthony Shaw.

48:07.640 --> 48:10.119
Although he may be
using another name.

48:10.120 --> 48:13.919
He's my son, and he's been
missing for years.

48:13.920 --> 48:16.920
You're quite certain, all of you?

48:18.360 --> 48:20.080
I'm sorry, madam.

48:22.320 --> 48:25.399
It's this young man I'm looking for.

48:25.400 --> 48:27.959
It's my son, and he's missing.

48:27.960 --> 48:32.359
If he didn't stay here,
maybe he worked here?

48:32.360 --> 48:34.542
No, I've never seen him.

48:36.120 --> 48:38.848
He's a handsome boy, isn't he?

48:41.080 --> 48:45.626
Not much further till we get
to my little hideaway.

48:51.040 --> 48:52.880
That's Anthony.

48:53.960 --> 48:56.679
I've only seen one
photograph of him before.

48:56.680 --> 48:59.879
Yes, I hope it doesn't seem
like a shrine to him.

48:59.880 --> 49:02.517
We were The Three Musketeers.

49:03.480 --> 49:05.919
On our best days, anyway.

49:05.920 --> 49:07.959
Isn't this a wonderful bottle?

49:07.960 --> 49:09.999
Richard keeps them here for me.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.999
Because I don't partake any more.

49:13.000 --> 49:16.079
My hell-raising days are over.

49:16.080 --> 49:18.717
Well, almost.

49:20.800 --> 49:23.839
This is the place
we always come to dream.

49:23.840 --> 49:25.400
To dream?

49:26.560 --> 49:28.640
That's right.

49:30.480 --> 49:33.559
You're a man of dreams, too,
aren't you, Samuel?

49:33.560 --> 49:35.359
Yes, maybe.

49:35.360 --> 49:39.479
About future inventions,
that sort of thing, yes.

49:39.480 --> 49:42.159
All three of us are dreamers, then.

49:42.160 --> 49:46.159
We've set the world to rights
many times in this room, Samuel.

49:46.160 --> 49:48.479
Talked about how to make it safe.

49:48.480 --> 49:51.759
Well, safer, certainly.

49:51.760 --> 49:55.719
Like, for instance, what to do
about the secret service.

49:55.720 --> 49:58.965
They almost certainly caused
the shooting you were caught up in,

49:58.966 --> 50:00.864
- Samuel.
- I know.

50:00.866 --> 50:02.839
They're out of
control, no question.

50:02.840 --> 50:05.999
In fact, I'd say they're the cause
of all of our problems,

50:06.000 --> 50:08.799
not only in this country,
but in the US,

50:08.800 --> 50:11.891
the secret service in Europe, too.

50:12.400 --> 50:18.879
They're behind all the so-called
"accidents" of history.

50:18.880 --> 50:21.519
I've spent all my life in diplomacy,
Samuel, as you know.

50:21.520 --> 50:23.959
I've been an ambassador,
even secretary-general

50:23.960 --> 50:26.719
of the League of Nations for a
while, and wherever you are

50:26.720 --> 50:31.879
in the world, whatever job you're
doing, they're always bloody there.

50:31.880 --> 50:34.599
And now the Russians have penetrated
our secret service to quite

50:34.600 --> 50:37.159
a ridiculous extent.

50:37.160 --> 50:40.199
And that's worrying,
isn't it, Samuel?

50:40.200 --> 50:42.839
Yes, it is, very unsettling, yes.

50:42.840 --> 50:46.479
As a White Russian, you must really
mind that, mustn't you?

50:46.480 --> 50:49.880
Of course. And also
as an Englishman.

50:51.080 --> 50:54.199
There are, however,
one or two members of

50:54.200 --> 50:57.439
the secret service who I trust.

50:57.440 --> 50:59.359
They're friends of mine,

50:59.360 --> 51:04.919
and they're determined to fight
the penetration by the Russians.

51:04.920 --> 51:06.959
And the general?

51:06.960 --> 51:09.759
Where does he fit in?

51:09.760 --> 51:12.279
We told you, don't worry
about the general.

51:12.280 --> 51:14.439
We hardly know him.

51:14.440 --> 51:18.399
Now, I would like to propose
a toast, to us.

51:18.400 --> 51:22.919
There's a problem,
I can't with water, it's unlucky.

51:22.920 --> 51:28.639
Well.
One drop will banish the bad luck.

51:31.760 --> 51:35.759
So, Samuel, here's to us three.

51:35.760 --> 51:38.397
And our plans for the future.

51:39.440 --> 51:41.040
To us, yes.

51:47.320 --> 51:49.959
If you'll excuse me one moment.

51:49.960 --> 51:53.233
You're always slipping away, Samuel.

51:53.440 --> 51:55.531
The end of the passage.

52:22.680 --> 52:25.679
Thank you for the meal
and for the wine.

52:25.680 --> 52:27.919
I think I must return
to the hospital,

52:27.920 --> 52:30.119
I'm not feeling
particularly well.

52:30.120 --> 52:33.399
You're feeling unwell?
Is there something we can do?

52:33.400 --> 52:35.759
No, no, I'd just rather be there.

52:35.760 --> 52:41.306
After all, it's the place
to be when you're feeling like this.

53:28.080 --> 53:30.520
Can I help you, madam?

53:32.000 --> 53:36.455
- I just wondered...
- What is it you want, madam?

53:38.880 --> 53:42.517
I just wanted a word
with that young man.

53:47.960 --> 53:49.880
Excuse me?

54:00.160 --> 54:01.880
Excuse me?

54:10.960 --> 54:12.440
Anthony?

54:13.800 --> 54:15.800
Can I help you, madam?

54:17.560 --> 54:22.015
- I've found you.
- His name's David, not Anthony.

54:22.560 --> 54:24.599
David Harris.

54:24.600 --> 54:26.239
You couldn't leave us
a moment, please?

54:26.240 --> 54:27.799
But I've got to continue
this work...

54:27.800 --> 54:31.073
Could you leave us a moment,
please?!

54:46.000 --> 54:47.440
Anthony!

54:50.960 --> 54:52.640
God!

54:55.600 --> 54:59.000
Sorry, madam, but my name is David.

55:01.200 --> 55:02.760
I work here.

55:03.720 --> 55:06.993
You've mistaken me for someone else.

55:07.040 --> 55:09.079
It's all right.

55:09.080 --> 55:11.439
It's all right, Anthony,

55:11.440 --> 55:13.280
I know it's a shock.

55:14.400 --> 55:18.519
I don't mind what you're calling
yourself. I'll call you David,

55:18.520 --> 55:20.040
if you like.

55:21.480 --> 55:24.399
But I know it's you. It is you.

55:24.400 --> 55:27.491
Madam, I'm not who you think I am.

55:29.680 --> 55:32.771
I need to get on with this, madam.

55:38.480 --> 55:41.079
Do you... do you live here?

55:41.080 --> 55:43.919
Do you sleep here, in the hotel?

55:43.920 --> 55:45.800
Yes, madam, I do.

55:47.920 --> 55:50.520
OK. OK, then.

55:52.520 --> 55:54.884
That's all I need to know.

56:02.160 --> 56:04.239
- Hello?
- Richard?

56:04.240 --> 56:07.599
Kathleen, there you are!
Where are you, darling?

56:07.600 --> 56:11.119
I've found him. I've found Anthony!

56:11.120 --> 56:15.239
What?! You have?! You really have?!

56:15.240 --> 56:16.599
Yes, yes!

56:16.600 --> 56:18.879
He's calling himself David,
but I know it's him!

56:18.880 --> 56:22.079
What do you mean you know it's him?
I mean, is it him or not?

56:22.080 --> 56:25.199
It is him, it's definitely him!

56:25.200 --> 56:28.479
Darling, I'll explain
all when you get here.

56:28.480 --> 56:32.159
I'm at a hotel in Norfolk,
the Bedingham Hall Hotel,

56:32.160 --> 56:35.839
near Cromer.
Come first thing, won't you?

56:35.840 --> 56:38.639
I... I can't believe it.

56:38.640 --> 56:41.079
I... I can't believe
you've found him.

56:41.080 --> 56:44.279
- I'll definitely set off really early.
- Just you, darling.

56:44.280 --> 56:46.479
Nobody else, not even the driver.

56:46.480 --> 56:49.844
- We don't want to frighten him.
- No.

56:57.040 --> 56:59.479
- Is that you, Mr Field?
- Samuel.

56:59.480 --> 57:02.759
- Where the hell are you?
- I need to see you, Mr Field.

57:02.760 --> 57:06.199
It's about bloody time! We certainly
do need to see each other!

57:06.200 --> 57:08.199
Look, come here for 11 o'clock.

57:08.200 --> 57:10.839
I need to do something first -
we're moving offices, you see.

57:10.840 --> 57:13.120
I'll be there. 11 sharp.

58:27.240 --> 58:28.640
Mr Field?

58:30.400 --> 58:31.920
Mr Field?

58:36.760 --> 58:41.397
I only went out for half an hour,
and this happened.

58:43.280 --> 58:45.553
They even killed the dog.

58:47.680 --> 58:50.953
We really have to put
a stop to this.
