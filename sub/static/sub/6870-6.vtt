00:04.200 --> 00:06.719
("Midnight Blues" playing)

00:06.721 --> 00:13.075
CHARLENE: ♪ Got too much time
And nowhere to go ♪

00:13.077 --> 00:20.849
♪ But I drink enough
to say hello ♪

00:28.348 --> 00:30.378

Not to give a... ♪
LANA: Goddamn it!

00:33.259 --> 00:35.292
CHERLENE: Cut!
Okay, whoa!

00:35.294 --> 00:37.294
Cut it, fellas!
(music stops)

00:37.296 --> 00:38.929
ARCHER: Man, I am blowing
this jug.

00:38.931 --> 00:41.067
CHERLENE: What the hell is
wrong with you?

00:41.187 --> 00:42.854
LANA: You are what's wrong
with me!

00:42.856 --> 00:44.622
It's 5:50 in the goddamn
morning!

00:44.624 --> 00:46.624
CHERLENE: Uh, duh, it's
called the golden hour.

00:46.626 --> 00:48.426
LANA: The...
PAM: The light takes on a

00:48.428 --> 00:49.894
special quality.
LANA: I know what it means,

00:49.896 --> 00:51.596
but...
CHERLENE: Then you know it's

00:51.598 --> 00:53.331
the best time to record stuff,
so...

00:53.333 --> 00:55.166
LANA: Film!
It's the best time to record

00:55.168 --> 00:57.235
things on film!
It cannot possibly have any

00:57.237 --> 00:59.637
effect on recording audio.
KRIEGER: Oh, was I supposed

00:59.639 --> 01:01.439
to be recording that?
CHERLENE: Krieger!

01:01.441 --> 01:03.074
PAM: Goddamn it.
(Cherlene growls)

01:03.076 --> 01:04.542
CHERLENE: We're losing the
light!

01:04.544 --> 01:06.444
ARCHER: We're not losing me
blowing this jug.

01:06.446 --> 01:07.845
MALORY: Are you bothering
them?

01:07.847 --> 01:10.248
LANA: I am, and also,
happy Opposite Day.

01:10.250 --> 01:12.283
MALORY: Is she bothering you?
OTHERS: Yes!

01:12.285 --> 01:14.252
MALORY: Stop bothering them.
LANA: They're the ones...

01:14.254 --> 01:16.220
MALORY: They are trying to
make a record, Lana, and there

01:16.222 --> 01:18.656
is a finite amount of golden
hour.

01:18.658 --> 01:20.391
LANA: Which, again...
MALORY: I know, but if

01:20.393 --> 01:22.693
Cherlene's happy...
CHERLENE: Outlaw country,

01:22.695 --> 01:24.896
woooooo!
(music playing)

01:24.898 --> 01:27.765
MALORY: "Woo," exactly.
Then I am happy.

01:27.767 --> 01:30.468
Or at least I will be, once we
start selling some records.

01:30.470 --> 01:32.370
LANA: I'll be happy when I
can sleep without getting up to

01:32.372 --> 01:34.505
pee every six minutes.
MALORY: Pfft, you think

01:34.507 --> 01:37.141
you're not sleeping now?
Wait till that thing's born.

01:37.143 --> 01:38.743
LANA: Oh!
MALORY: So do yourself and

01:38.745 --> 01:41.412
those bosoms of yours a favor,
and get a wet nurse.

01:41.414 --> 01:43.881
LANA: That cannot still be
a thing.

01:43.883 --> 01:45.817
MALORY: Preferably one who
cooks.

01:45.819 --> 01:49.620
We had a Dominican, just lovely,
bosoms like... well, like yours,

01:49.622 --> 01:54.192
but umpteen babies later.
My God, Sterling loved her.

01:54.194 --> 01:56.627
She was with us nearly four
years.

01:56.629 --> 02:01.165
Now what was her name?
I want to say Mariela?

02:01.167 --> 02:03.734
Maricela?
Wait, or Ruby?

02:03.736 --> 02:05.503
LANA: I don't...
MALORY: The point is, they

02:05.505 --> 02:08.205
steal from you; it's just the
cost of doing business.

02:08.208 --> 02:10.308
(Lana sighs)
LANA: Steal what?

02:10.310 --> 02:13.177
We haven't been paid in months,
Malory; I'm pretty much broke.

02:13.179 --> 02:15.780
MALORY: Join the club.
Because believe me, if I had

02:15.782 --> 02:19.617
the money, I would get the hell
out of this... Hillbilly Hilton.

02:19.619 --> 02:21.719
KRIEGER: Am I supposed to be
recording <i>this?</i>

02:21.721 --> 02:23.621

02:23.623 --> 02:25.356

03:12.647 --> 03:15.564
MALORY: Item one:
Woodhouse, scrape.

03:15.804 --> 03:18.605
WOODHOUSE: Yes, mum.
(all groaning)

03:18.607 --> 03:21.141
MALORY: And gripe all you
want, but no one is eating Eggs

03:21.143 --> 03:24.144
Woodhouse until you people start
bringing in some money!

03:24.146 --> 03:26.246
ARCHER: But they were already
cooked; what good does it do

03:26.248 --> 03:28.281
to throw them away?
MALORY: None.

03:28.283 --> 03:31.685
That's the whole point.
And no cocaine donuts for you!

03:31.687 --> 03:34.054
PAM (muffled): Aw, come on!
I got to load up my body before

03:34.056 --> 03:36.189
Krieger sells it all!
ARCHER: Before what?

03:36.191 --> 03:38.058
CHERLENE: What?
PAM: Krieger's selling the

03:38.060 --> 03:41.194
cocaine online.
MALORY: Are you insane?

03:41.196 --> 03:44.131
KRIEGER: Yeah, if it's insane
to use an X-gen asymmetric onion

03:44.133 --> 03:46.299
router and digital
cryptocurrency to sell your

03:46.301 --> 03:49.569
cocaine anonymously and
completely risk-free.

03:49.571 --> 03:52.639
Ah...
Or a lot of the other shit I do.

03:52.641 --> 03:55.142
MALORY: But... so do people
e-mail you, or...?

03:55.144 --> 03:57.244
KRIEGER: No.
It's like shopping online, only

03:57.246 --> 03:59.813
for cocaine.
I've already sold, uh...

03:59.815 --> 04:03.416
Wow, almost 800 grand worth.
MALORY: Really?

04:03.418 --> 04:05.619
But how do we get paid?
KRIEGER: With a totally

04:05.621 --> 04:07.687
untraceable digital currency
that we can exchange for real

04:07.689 --> 04:12.526
U.S. dollars whenever we want.
I call 'em Kriegerrands.

04:12.528 --> 04:14.528
MALORY: And then how do they
get the cocaine?

04:14.530 --> 04:22.669
KRIEGER: We pack it up and
MALORY: Oh, for...

04:22.671 --> 04:27.307
I'll send up some help. And,
missy, you had better watch it.

04:27.309 --> 04:33.480
(noisy chewing)
ARCHER (mouth full): Jesus,

04:33.482 --> 04:35.482
these taste like calluses.
PAM: Ew.

04:35.484 --> 04:37.384
CYRIL: Gross.
RAY: That's so accurate.

04:37.386 --> 04:39.853
ARCHER: Lana.
Lana.

04:39.855 --> 04:42.055
La...

04:42.057 --> 04:50.764
CHERLENE: What's up her
gigantic giant ass?

04:50.766 --> 04:52.899
RAY: Wh...
Probably you shitheads!

04:52.901 --> 04:54.634
OTHERS: What did we do?
RAY: Besides keeping

04:54.636 --> 04:56.836
everybody up all night with your
damn hootenannies...

04:56.838 --> 04:59.105
ARCHER: Wait, that was a
hootenanny?

04:59.107 --> 05:01.408
RAY: ...has anybody even
thought about throwing her a

05:01.410 --> 05:03.543
goddamn baby shower?!
CHERLENE: Ew!

05:03.545 --> 05:05.111
PAM: Um...
CYRIL: Pfft, you mean a

05:05.113 --> 05:06.646
bastard sh... Ow!
ARCHER: Cyril, shut your

05:06.648 --> 05:09.349
pout-hole, accept the fact that
Lana was so far out of your

05:09.351 --> 05:12.285
league that impregnating her
would've basically been

05:12.287 --> 05:15.755
interspecies breeding, and get
on with your life!

05:15.757 --> 05:18.625
And then go get a cake.
Okay, Ray...

05:18.627 --> 05:21.294
MALORY: Ray, Cyril, go help
Krieger pack the cocaine.

05:21.296 --> 05:23.563
Cherlene, go pick or grin or
something, and the rest of

05:23.565 --> 05:25.432
you...
ARCHER: We're throwing Lana

05:25.434 --> 05:27.234
a baby shower.
MALORY: Wh...?

05:27.236 --> 05:30.470
We haven't done that yet?
I said move, people!

05:30.472 --> 05:33.273
Go, go, go, go, go!
(Ray bleats)

05:33.275 --> 05:35.609
Idiots.
All right, I need them here

05:35.611 --> 05:38.612
making music and packaging
cocaine, so this baby shower is

05:38.614 --> 05:41.314
up to you.
Don't cock it up like you did

05:41.316 --> 05:43.583
Texas!
PAM: Hey!

05:43.585 --> 05:45.452
MALORY: Oh, blow it out
your ass!

05:45.454 --> 05:47.454
(Pam farts)
(Archer laughs)

05:47.456 --> 05:49.456
ARCHER: I was hoping you'd
do that.

05:49.458 --> 05:52.525
Okay, we should make a list.
Item one: some paper to write

05:52.527 --> 05:54.694
said list on.
(gasps)

05:54.696 --> 05:57.264
Item two... Woodhouse!
Get in here!

05:57.266 --> 05:59.366
WOODHOUSE: Sir?
ARCHER: Here, here's...

05:59.368 --> 06:02.202
400 bucks; go get all the stuff
for a baby shower: cake,

06:02.204 --> 06:05.372
decorations, some of those water
guns shaped like dicks...

06:05.374 --> 06:07.407
PAM: I think that's
bachelorette parties.

06:07.409 --> 06:10.477
ARCHER: Really?
Wow, okay, that explains...

06:10.479 --> 06:12.846
Uh, never mind.
And, Woodhouse,

06:12.848 --> 06:15.715
if you spend any of this on
heroin, you better buy enough to

06:15.717 --> 06:17.784
O.D. on, bec...
WOODHOUSE: Will do!

06:17.786 --> 06:20.353
ARCHER: Will don't!
PAM: Wait, so if Woodhouse is

06:20.355 --> 06:22.289
getting everything we need for
the party, then...

06:22.291 --> 06:24.424
ARCHER: Oh, not everything,
Pam.

06:24.426 --> 06:28.461
Because... you and I are going
to get Kenny Loggins to play

06:28.463 --> 06:31.598
Lana's baby shower.
PAM: Goddamn it.

06:31.600 --> 06:40.840
ARCHER: Pam. Danger zone. ♪
Wait, wait, wait, no.

06:40.842 --> 06:43.576
♪ This is it.
KRIEGER: Yeah, you guys box

06:43.578 --> 06:45.979
it up, I slap on a mailing label
from the printer, bing bang

06:45.981 --> 06:48.848
boom, it's good to go zoom.
CYRIL: So, why are we in

06:48.850 --> 06:50.950
our underwear?
KRIEGER: Eh, don't worry

06:50.952 --> 06:52.986
about it.
PAM: Because it kind of seems

06:52.988 --> 06:55.455
like this is about you and not
really about Lana.

06:55.457 --> 06:57.891
ARCHER: Okay, A, Lana loves
Kenny Loggins.

06:57.893 --> 06:59.893
PAM: Really?
ARCHER: I don't know.

06:59.895 --> 07:02.495
I mean, I assume she does.
I do.

07:02.497 --> 07:04.597
GUARD: Whoa, whoa, where you
think you're going?

07:04.599 --> 07:07.300
ARCHER: Uh, well, to give Mr.
Loggins his wardrobe.

07:07.302 --> 07:09.602
GUARD: Not without a pass
you're not.

07:09.604 --> 07:11.871
ARCHER: Yeah, we...
PAM: Hey, I appreciate you're

07:11.873 --> 07:14.441
just doing your job, but if
Kenny doesn't get this

07:14.443 --> 07:16.543
embroidered hippie shirt and
these gigantic bell-bottoms, I

07:16.545 --> 07:18.545
highly doubt you'll have a job
tomorrow.

07:18.547 --> 07:20.547
GUARD: Look, he ain't even
here.

07:20.549 --> 07:22.549
He's probably still at the
Tuntmore.

07:22.551 --> 07:24.551
PAM: Now, was that so hard...
neck nuts?

07:24.553 --> 07:26.653
ARCHER: Good instincts back
there, Pam.

07:26.655 --> 07:29.622
That's what we field agents
call... Hmm.

07:29.624 --> 07:31.891
Guess I'm not a field agent
anymore though.

07:31.893 --> 07:34.894
(Pam laughs)
PAM: Man, you got to miss it.

07:34.896 --> 07:37.764
What a rush!
ARCHER: Yeah, I miss it, but

07:37.766 --> 07:40.033
calm down.
Jesus, it's not like you killed

07:40.035 --> 07:42.535
a guy.
Taxi!

07:42.537 --> 07:44.754
(car door closes)
Okay, so phase two may call for

07:44.756 --> 07:47.407
some field craft.
A, there's no way a superstar

07:47.409 --> 07:49.976
like Kenny Loggins is gonna be
registered under his own name.

07:49.978 --> 07:52.345
PAM (laughs): Yeah.
It's not like he's Messina.

07:52.347 --> 07:54.314
ARCHER: Don't do that.
Don't ever do that!

07:54.316 --> 07:56.649
PAM: Sorry! Geez!
ARCHER: You should be.

07:56.651 --> 07:59.986
Jim Messina is a genius, and
without him, no Poco.

07:59.988 --> 08:02.522
Where was I?
Oh, yeah, we'll probably need to

08:02.524 --> 08:04.524
access the computer terminal at
reception, so just follow my

08:04.526 --> 08:06.526
lead.
PAM: Could I just follow

08:06.528 --> 08:08.528
Kenny Loggins?
ARCHER: Wha...?

08:08.530 --> 08:10.530
KENNY LOGGINS: Well, maybe
because it's in the rider,

08:10.532 --> 08:12.532
which I'll be happy to come down
there and shove up his ass.

08:12.534 --> 08:14.567
ARCHER: Uh, excuse me, Mr.Loggins?

08:14.569 --> 08:16.569
Hi, I'm, uh...
KENNY LOGGINS: Uh-huh,

08:16.571 --> 08:18.571
uh-huh, uh-huh.
ARCHER: What the shit,

08:18.573 --> 08:20.573
Loggins?!
KENNY LOGGINS: Ricky, bad

08:20.575 --> 08:22.575
touch!
RICKY: Hands off Mr. Loggins!

08:22.577 --> 08:24.577
ARCHER: Hands off me, Lurch.
Look at my suit.

08:24.579 --> 08:26.579
KENNY LOGGINS: Zap, Ricky,
zap!

08:26.581 --> 08:28.581
ARCHER: Hey... Aah!
(Pam screams)

08:28.583 --> 08:31.351
KENNY LOGGINS: Uh, hang on.
Hit him again.

08:31.353 --> 08:33.520
PAM: Wait! No, no, no, no!
ARCHER: What?! I...

08:33.522 --> 08:35.922
(grunting gibberish)
KENNY LOGGINS: What's that?

08:35.924 --> 08:38.691
No, no, never mind.
It's just a fan.

08:38.693 --> 08:40.994
(Archer groans)
PAM: Holy shit zaps!

08:40.996 --> 08:43.029
Are you okay?
(Archer coughs)

08:43.030 --> 08:45.366
ARCHER: Yeah, and I don't
know about you, but

08:45.486 --> 08:46.725
I'm gonna be pretty upset

08:46.845 --> 08:49.111
if I end up having to murder
Kenny Loggins.

08:50.804 --> 08:52.271
Meh.

08:53.746 --> 08:56.721
ARCHER: Yeah, that's fair!
Kick out the guy whose custom

08:56.961 --> 09:00.579
Super 220 wool suit was ruined
by Kenny Loggins!

09:00.581 --> 09:02.581
And where were you during all
that?

09:02.583 --> 09:05.584
PAM: Oh, man, I was like,
"What?!"

09:05.586 --> 09:08.520
So, what's up? What's the plan?
ARCHER: (sighs) The plan is

09:08.522 --> 09:12.157
shut up and come on.
GILLETTE: No, we have to play

09:12.159 --> 09:15.160
games at the baby shower.
There's Don't Drop the Baby, uh,

09:15.162 --> 09:18.730
Dirty Diaper Game...
CYRIL: What in God's name is

09:18.732 --> 09:20.833
the Dirty Diaper Game?
GILLETTE: Oh, my God, it's

09:20.835 --> 09:22.835
hilarious.
You get a bunch of newborn

09:22.837 --> 09:25.003
diapers, then you microwave
different candy bars...

09:25.005 --> 09:28.106
CYRIL: Stop! Yeah, let me
just stop you there, because if

09:28.108 --> 09:30.742
you finish that sentence, I'm
going to rub cocaine in your

09:30.744 --> 09:33.745
eyes until you are blind.
GILLETTE: Goddamn, Shawshank.

09:33.747 --> 09:35.981
LANA: Uh, Malory?
(Malory screams)

09:35.983 --> 09:38.183
LANA: What?!
MALORY: What... do you want?

LANA: I, um...

09:40.221 --> 09:43.655
Okay, so, as you know, or should
know, I'm pregnant and...

09:43.657 --> 09:45.657
MALORY: (sighs) Lana, it's
too late to...

09:45.659 --> 09:47.693
LANA: Okay, let me stop you.
Having the baby-- don't know why

09:47.695 --> 09:49.695
that's such a mindbender for
everybody, but...

09:49.697 --> 09:51.830
MALORY (chuckling): Well...
LANA: But... Hush. I have a

09:51.832 --> 09:54.099
lot of pretty major expenses
coming up, and since we haven't

09:54.101 --> 09:57.603
been paid...
(sighs) Look, I hate to ask, but

09:57.605 --> 09:59.605
I need...
MALORY: WIC!

09:59.607 --> 10:01.607
LANA: What?
MALORY: It's like welfare but

10:01.609 --> 10:03.609
for babies.
I don't know-- I'm not a

10:03.611 --> 10:05.611
Democrat.
But I think they give you a

10:05.613 --> 10:14.953
birth cheese.
I only had $200.

10:14.955 --> 10:18.957
MALORY: Not you.
Really? $200?

10:18.959 --> 10:21.894
ARCHER: Okay, there's $200
for the uniforms, $100 for the

10:21.896 --> 10:26.932
sweet wigs and another $300 for
Kenny Loggins' room number.

10:26.934 --> 10:30.269
HOUSEKEEPER: Mm-hmm.
PAM: So, I'm curious-- why

10:30.271 --> 10:32.971
didn't you just call Cherlene,
who owns the hotel?

10:32.973 --> 10:35.107
ARCHER: (sighs) And I'm
curious-- why didn't you remind

10:35.109 --> 10:37.276
me about that until just now?
PAM: You said shut up,

10:37.278 --> 10:39.278
J. Alfred Gotrocks.
ARCHER: What?

10:39.280 --> 10:41.280
PAM: We haven't been paid in
forever.

10:41.282 --> 10:43.282
Where are you getting all this
money?

10:43.284 --> 10:46.385
ARCHER: I, uh...
sold some artwork?

10:46.387 --> 10:48.854
CHERLENE: Goddamn it!
What did I tell you about

10:48.856 --> 10:52.190
staying up on the wall, ghosts?!
ARCHER: Okay, since I am or

10:52.192 --> 10:56.695
was a world-class secret agent,
when we get up to his room, do

10:56.697 --> 10:59.698
actually follow my lead or...
PAM: Hang on, let me grab a

10:59.700 --> 11:01.867
name tag.
ARCHER: (gasps) Ruby! Ruby!

11:01.869 --> 11:03.869
Is there a Ruby?
See if there's a Ruby.

11:03.871 --> 11:06.138
Is there a Ruby?!
PAM: It's pretty close to

11:06.140 --> 11:08.140
Ruby.
ARCHER: No, Pam, it isn't.

11:08.142 --> 11:10.175
PAM: Well, why do...
ARCHER: Don't worry about it.

11:10.177 --> 11:12.711
Let it go.
And give me one of those mints.

11:12.713 --> 11:15.714
PAM: Dude, they're cocaine.
ARCHER: (sighs) Of course

11:15.716 --> 11:17.883
they are.
PAM: (laughs) Right?

11:17.885 --> 11:19.918
ARCHER: All right, here's the
penthouse.

11:19.920 --> 11:22.921
Now, I cannot stress this
enough, Pam: follow my lead.

11:22.923 --> 11:25.190
PAM: Okay.
ARCHER: Room ser...

11:25.192 --> 11:27.759
PAM: Housekeeping!
ARCHER: (clears throat) What

11:27.761 --> 11:30.228
did I just...
PAM: Prostitute!

11:30.230 --> 11:32.331

RICKY: What the hell is your

11:32.333 --> 11:36.401

PAM: Besides my face hurts?

11:36.403 --> 11:39.104
KENNY LOGGINS: Why do I pay
you 20 grand a month?

11:39.106 --> 11:41.940
I don't want to read about Kenny
Loggins; I want to read about

11:41.942 --> 11:45.344
K-Log.
(sighs) Jesus, don't ever get a

11:45.346 --> 11:48.246
publicist.
ARCHER: Well, as a lowly room

11:48.248 --> 11:51.883
service waiter, I probably
won't, but...

11:51.885 --> 11:54.886
Wow. Okay, uh...
KENNY LOGGINS: K-Log didn't

11:54.888 --> 11:58.156
order room service.
ARCHER: Sure, you did.

11:58.158 --> 12:01.326
KENNY LOGGINS: No, I didn't.
(crash, glass shatters)

12:01.328 --> 12:03.829
(Pam grunting)
ARCHER: A housekeeper and/or

12:03.831 --> 12:05.831
prostitute?
KENNY LOGGINS: You think

12:05.833 --> 12:08.033
K-Log needs to pay for sex, do
you?

12:08.035 --> 12:11.870
ARCHER: Mm... no, but, that
being said, I do think he needs

12:11.872 --> 12:14.906
to reevaluate this whole K-Log
thing.

12:14.908 --> 12:16.908
KENNY LOGGINS: Oh, yeah?
Well, I think you need to

12:16.910 --> 12:19.378
reevaluate your face.
ARCHER: My... Oh.

12:19.380 --> 12:20.846
(chuckles) Okay.
I can explain that.

12:20.966 --> 12:22.752
KENNY LOGGINS: How?
ARCHER: Uh...

12:23.236 --> 12:25.738
- Lip chemo?
- It's the crazy guy from the lobby!

12:25.858 --> 12:28.258
Which means you're no prostitute.

12:28.378 --> 12:30.337
And that being said,

12:30.457 --> 12:33.458
I am open to blow jobs for money.
I only got eight bucks on me,

12:33.460 --> 12:34.652
but...
ARCHER: Pam!

12:34.772 --> 12:38.096
Self-esteem, buddy. Come on.
Now, let's just put the gun down

12:38.098 --> 12:40.098
and...
RICKY: Mr. Loggins, please

12:40.100 --> 12:42.100
advise.
KENNY LOGGINS: K-Log.

12:42.102 --> 12:44.269
K-Log, damn it.
RICKY: Yeah, I'm kind of with

12:44.271 --> 12:46.905
him on that one.
KENNY LOGGINS: Oh, really?

12:46.907 --> 12:50.142
So you agree with Borgnar's
pathetic little errand boy?

12:50.144 --> 12:52.144
ARCHER: Wait, what?
And also who?

12:52.146 --> 12:54.212
KENNY LOGGINS: Well, I'll
tell you the same thing I told

12:54.214 --> 12:56.248
Borgnar that night in Caracas.
It's not for sale.

12:56.250 --> 12:58.250
At any price.
ARCHER: Who the hell is

12:58.252 --> 13:00.252

KENNY LOGGINS: Hi-yah!

13:04.258 --> 13:06.291
(Archer grunts)
Ricky, attack!

13:06.293 --> 13:10.162
PAM (chuckling): Yeah, Ricky.
(Ricky and Pam grunting)

13:10.164 --> 13:12.798
(Ricky screams)
ARCHER: Okay. Okay, good.

13:12.800 --> 13:16.802
Pam, are you good?
PAM (chuckling): Oh, yeah.

13:16.804 --> 13:20.972
(Ricky and Pam roaring)
(Ricky and Pam grunting)

13:20.974 --> 13:23.442
ARCHER: Yeah, good, okay.
'Cause this time, I may actually

13:23.444 --> 13:25.444
murder Kenny Loggins.
PAM: Wait, wait, wait, wait,

13:25.446 --> 13:27.512
wait!
ARCHER: What, Pam?!

13:27.514 --> 13:29.110
PAM: First see if he wants
a beej.

13:33.735 --> 13:36.876
(crashing, fighting)
ARCHER: Loggins! Loggins!

13:37.000 --> 13:39.434
Now, look, before either of us
does something we'll both

13:39.436 --> 13:42.804

(gunshots)

13:42.806 --> 13:46.774

I'll see him in hell!

14:03.693 --> 14:15.403
Wonder if it's too late
to get Messina.

14:15.405 --> 14:19.007
Holy shit.
What kind of colossal idiot

14:19.009 --> 14:21.876
would build a pool like that?
CHERLENE: I just want to go

14:21.878 --> 14:24.345
on record as saying
that a glass swimming pool on

14:24.347 --> 14:26.447
the penthouse balcony is,
without a doubt,

14:26.449 --> 14:29.551
the absolute worst idea that
I have ever heard in my entire

14:29.553 --> 14:33.888
goddamn life.
But you're the men, so...

14:33.890 --> 14:36.024
ARCHER: (chuckles) But can
you imagine banging in

14:36.026 --> 14:38.927
that thing?
Why, yes, Archer, yes, I can.

14:38.929 --> 14:40.795
KENNY LOGGINS: Drop it!
(gun cocks)

14:40.797 --> 14:43.298
Drop it on the ground.
ARCHER: Do you know how bad

14:43.300 --> 14:45.400
that is for it?
I will place it on the ground,

14:45.402 --> 14:47.302
but...
KENNY LOGGINS: You think

14:47.304 --> 14:50.705
K-Log won't shoot, punk?
ARCHER: No, I think K-Log is

14:50.707 --> 14:52.407
out of bullets.
KENNY LOGGINS: What?

14:52.409 --> 14:53.942
(gun clicks)
How did you...

14:53.944 --> 14:55.944
ARCHER: It's just a thing
I do.

14:55.946 --> 14:57.946
Now what the hell is in that
briefcase?

don't know.

put my weapon down, I'm not a

15:04.020 --> 15:06.321

in...?

15:14.798 --> 15:17.065

So one of...

15:20.003 --> 15:24.339

gonna happen now, so...

15:24.341 --> 15:26.341
KENNY LOGGINS: Aah!

15:33.783 --> 15:35.783

But why?

15:35.785 --> 15:37.885
ARCHER: What do you mean why?
(coughs)

15:37.887 --> 15:40.088
I wanted you to play a baby
shower. (coughs)

15:40.090 --> 15:42.624

ARCHER: The Dirty Diaper

Water guns shaped like dicks?

A baby shower.
KENNY LOGGINS: Oh.

15:47.497 --> 15:50.698
So, Borgnar? The briefcase?
ARCHER: I don't know anyone

15:50.700 --> 15:52.700
named Borgnar.
And I don't want your crazy

15:52.702 --> 15:54.702

What the hell is even in that

15:54.704 --> 15:56.704
thing?
KENNY LOGGINS: Don't worry

15:56.706 --> 15:58.806
about it.
Just let it go.

15:58.808 --> 16:00.875
ARCHER: I should let <i>you</i> go.
KENNY LOGGINS: Look, I'm...

16:00.877 --> 16:02.910

16:15.392 --> 16:18.893
is either plutonium or a human
