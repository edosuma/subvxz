<i>Here's what you missed on</i> Glee:
Kurt Hummel's back at McKinley!

00:03.224 --> 00:05.685
<i>Kurt's back at McKinley,</i>
<i>but he's still dating Blaine.</i>

00:05.695 --> 00:07.513
<i>Sam used to date Quinn,</i>
<i>but she's back with Finn,</i>

00:07.523 --> 00:08.738
<i>who used to date Rachel,</i>

00:08.748 --> 00:10.699
<i>who's still sort of in love</i>
<i>with him-- Finn, that is.</i>

00:10.750 --> 00:12.083
<i>Santana's in love</i>
<i>with Brittany,</i>

00:12.168 --> 00:13.401
<i>but she's too scared</i>
<i>to say it out loud--</i>

00:13.452 --> 00:14.568
But you told me
you were in love with me.

00:14.620 --> 00:15.903
I honestly don't know
what I was thinking.

00:15.955 --> 00:17.238
<i>And Britt's back</i>
<i>with Artie, anyways.</i>

00:17.289 --> 00:19.340
<i>Kids these days.</i>
I have a question.

00:19.408 --> 00:21.209
<i>Sue's bent on destroying the</i>
<i>Glee Club before Nationals.</i>

00:21.260 --> 00:22.627
Destroy the Glee Club!

00:22.712 --> 00:24.596
<i>She even formed an evil league</i>
<i>with nicknames.</i>

00:24.680 --> 00:26.414
The League of Doom.
I don't think I was listening

00:26.465 --> 00:28.508
when you said what our name was.
Is it League or Legion?

00:28.518 --> 00:30.031
Worst henchmen ever.

00:30.041 --> 00:31.611

Hi, I'm Brittany S. Pierce,

00:43.335 --> 00:46.137
and this is my new Internet
talk show, <i>Fondue for Two,</i>

00:46.221 --> 00:48.956
which combines the two things
I like most:

00:49.008 --> 00:51.342
hot cheese
and talking to people.

00:51.427 --> 00:55.346
My first two guests are
the school's biggest gossips,

00:55.431 --> 00:58.349
Mercedes Jones and
Ms. Tina Cohen-Chang.

00:58.434 --> 01:00.068
Shouldn't it be
<i>Fondue for Three?</i>

01:00.135 --> 01:03.988
Oh, my God, that is hot!

01:04.072 --> 01:06.157
Okay, so let's get down
to some hot dish.

01:06.241 --> 01:09.193
Um, I heard a rumor that
Mr. Kidney the janitor walks

01:09.278 --> 01:10.995
around school drinking vodka
out of a teapot.

01:11.063 --> 01:12.146
Is this really what they were

01:12.197 --> 01:13.247
doing in the '70s?

01:13.315 --> 01:14.999
Hot mess Mr. Kidney
aside, I want

01:15.084 --> 01:18.836
to talk about the rumor
about Asian men: not true.

01:18.921 --> 01:20.088
I mean, it's not even good.

01:20.155 --> 01:21.589
It tastes the way
a baby's diaper smells.

01:21.657 --> 01:23.491
I heard a rumor that Santana
plays for the other team,

01:23.542 --> 01:25.460
and I can confirm that rumor:
It's 100% true.

01:25.511 --> 01:27.495
Wait. What?

01:27.546 --> 01:29.180
Brittany, are you serious?

01:29.264 --> 01:30.848
Yes.
(cat meows)

01:30.933 --> 01:32.667
BRITTANY:
Look, it's Lord Tubbington.

01:32.718 --> 01:34.102
Hi!

01:34.169 --> 01:36.187
Hi. (smooches)

01:36.271 --> 01:37.438
This is Lord Tubbington.

01:37.506 --> 01:39.107
(baby talk):
Say hi to the camera.

01:39.174 --> 01:41.175
You want some cheese?

01:41.226 --> 01:42.343
That's disgusting.

01:42.394 --> 01:44.028
That's my baby.

01:44.113 --> 01:46.864
So, you're just gonna
gonna let him do that?

01:46.949 --> 01:49.990
Lord Tubbington's allowed to eat
cheese because he's on Atkins.

01:50.199 --> 01:52.734
Okay, well, that's all we have
time for today.

01:52.785 --> 01:55.203
Tune in next week
for <i>Fondue for Two.</i>

01:55.254 --> 01:58.106
We will be dipping raw meat
into boiling chocolate.

02:01.444 --> 02:03.421

02:03.621 --> 02:04.922
Hey.

02:05.006 --> 02:07.624
Why are you talking to me?
Can't I say hello?

02:07.709 --> 02:09.008
I guess. It's just Santana

02:09.077 --> 02:10.426
told me never
to speak alone with you

02:10.512 --> 02:12.379
because you would try
to steal all of my gold.

02:12.430 --> 02:16.183
Okay, uh... anyway,
I got you this.

02:16.250 --> 02:18.469
I know everyone's always
making fun of your lips,

02:18.553 --> 02:20.471
but I think they're cute
and worth weatherproofing.

02:20.538 --> 02:23.057
So, considering that
we're both single

02:23.108 --> 02:24.725
and I think your lips are cute,

02:24.776 --> 02:27.895
I was wondering if you would
go to to prom with me?

02:27.946 --> 02:29.146
As in your date?
Yeah.

02:29.214 --> 02:32.366
No.
No... "No, No" as in...?

02:32.433 --> 02:34.051
As in no prom.
Oh.

02:34.119 --> 02:35.435
I don't think I'm going.

02:35.487 --> 02:37.738
Are you worried
that Finn will be jealous?

02:37.789 --> 02:42.159
Look, you're just
not my type, okay, Rachel?

02:42.243 --> 02:45.245
So thanks for the lip chap.

02:47.677 --> 02:50.628
I feel like my life
finally has purpose.

02:50.680 --> 02:53.682
It's so nice to be a part of a
cause that's bigger than myself.

02:53.766 --> 02:56.151
Honey Badger, I am so thrilled,

02:56.235 --> 02:57.936
Can I ask why you're dressed
like David Bowie?

02:58.004 --> 02:59.187
I'm incognito.

02:59.272 --> 03:00.822
We're going deep
behind enemy lines.

03:00.906 --> 03:02.741
People are starting
to sense my weakness.

03:02.808 --> 03:04.743
They think I've
totally lost my grip.

03:04.810 --> 03:06.161
Can I help you?
Oh, yes.

03:06.245 --> 03:09.164
Can I have a hot tea, please?

03:09.248 --> 03:11.449
I'd just like a large cup
of mocha powder.

03:11.500 --> 03:12.951
David Bowie's incredibly
eccentric.

03:13.002 --> 03:14.753
Um, we don't take euros.

03:14.820 --> 03:17.756
So, Honey Badger, last week,
I had a revelation.

03:17.823 --> 03:19.424
Now, as you may
or may not know,

03:19.491 --> 03:20.658
the Middle East is in chaos.

03:20.710 --> 03:22.043
You know what started it all?

03:22.128 --> 03:23.828
No. A little Web site
called Wikileaks.

03:23.879 --> 03:25.213
You ever hear of them?

03:25.298 --> 03:27.515
Well, they let loose
with a couple of rumors.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.117
So I told Figgins

03:29.185 --> 03:31.219
I wanted to resuscitate
<i>The Muckraker.</i>

03:31.304 --> 03:33.288
But the school newspaper was
discontinued two years ago,

03:33.356 --> 03:35.506
due to lack of interest.

03:35.558 --> 03:37.559
The newspaper is making
a comeback at this school,

03:37.643 --> 03:38.860
and like print
newspapers everywhere,

03:38.928 --> 03:40.228
we're leaner
and meaner--

03:40.313 --> 03:43.281
no longer concerned
with facts, fact-checking,

03:43.349 --> 03:44.849
integrity or facts.

03:44.900 --> 03:46.985
<i>The Muckraker</i> motto?

03:47.036 --> 03:50.538
"If I heard it, it's probably
true or something."

03:50.623 --> 03:52.824
Sorry, but did you just
change disguises?

03:52.875 --> 03:55.026
I'm pretty sure that
barista's onto me.

03:55.077 --> 03:56.828
Now I'm Ann Coulter.

03:56.879 --> 04:00.048
As you may have noticed,
I'm coming slightly unhinged.

04:00.132 --> 04:01.699
Ohio loves you, Ann Coulter!

04:01.751 --> 04:04.702
That's better.
(sighs with relief)

04:04.754 --> 04:07.222
Can I make an observation?

04:07.306 --> 04:10.258
You're always trying to destroy
Will from inside the Glee Club.

04:10.343 --> 04:14.212
But I would like to try getting
him <i>out</i> of the Glee Club.

04:14.263 --> 04:18.733
Now, I was trolling the Internet
last night and I had an idea.

04:18.817 --> 04:20.517
I'll drink to that.

04:24.323 --> 04:26.891
(school bell ringing)

04:26.942 --> 04:28.827
Excuse me.

04:28.894 --> 04:31.413
Do you know
where a gal can find

04:31.480 --> 04:33.164
a pipin' hot cup of
Will Schuester?

04:33.468 --> 04:36.904
Oh, my God! April!

04:36.971 --> 04:38.606
What are you doing here?

04:38.657 --> 04:40.190
I thought you were on Broadway!

04:40.275 --> 04:44.311
I was! My all-white production of
<i>The Wiz</i> was a disaster.

04:44.362 --> 04:45.613
- Oh, April, I'm so sorry.
- Don't be!

04:45.664 --> 04:48.415
Being publicly humiliated
by the <i>New York Times</i>

04:48.483 --> 04:49.867
gets me to thinking--

04:49.951 --> 04:52.836
why am I weighing myself down
with the "Broadway classics"?

04:52.866 --> 04:54.175
I should just tell my own story.

04:54.205 --> 04:55.460
So I wrote the libretto

04:55.490 --> 04:58.425
to <i>Crossrhodes!</i>
<i>The April Rhodes Story.</i>

04:58.493 --> 04:59.627
You're writing a musical?

04:59.678 --> 05:01.629
Yep. That's why I'm here.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.965
So, Will, remember how
I bought you your auditorium?

05:05.016 --> 05:05.966
Oh, yeah.

05:05.996 --> 05:09.491
Well, I'm gonna need to borrow it
cause I'm running a little low on funds.

05:09.521 --> 05:12.222
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!

05:12.307 --> 05:14.341
Get your <i>Muckraker</i> here.

05:14.392 --> 05:15.943
Extra! Extra!
Get your <i>Muckracker</i> here!

05:16.010 --> 05:17.678
Hey. I think we should talk
about Nationals.

05:17.729 --> 05:19.279
We need to do a duet.

05:19.309 --> 05:20.702
I don't think that's a good idea.

05:20.732 --> 05:22.182
Why are you so concerned

05:22.233 --> 05:23.517
with Quinn's feelings

05:23.547 --> 05:25.290
when she obviously has
no interest in yours?

05:25.320 --> 05:26.537
What are you talking about?

05:26.621 --> 05:28.188
Haven't you read <i>The Muckraker?</i>

05:28.239 --> 05:29.573
It's our school's newspaper.

05:29.658 --> 05:33.043
Look at the "Blind Items" column.

05:33.073 --> 05:34.432
"What prom queen candidate is spending

05:34.462 --> 05:35.967
a lot of time in her closet?"

05:35.997 --> 05:37.669
Now that's garbage.
Quinn's claustrophobic.

05:37.699 --> 05:39.852
No, that's Santana. Read the next one.

05:43.588 --> 05:45.306
What the hell is this, dude?

05:45.373 --> 05:48.947
"What blondie former cheerleader is having
"a secret Moonlight Motel rendezvous

05:48.977 --> 05:51.232
- with another big-lipped blondie?"
- Where does it say that?

05:51.262 --> 05:52.734
Right on the front page
of the school newspaper!

05:52.764 --> 05:54.402
You don't seriously
believe this, do you?

05:54.432 --> 05:57.238
Well, why shouldn't I? Why wouldn't he
do the same thing that I did to him?

05:57.268 --> 05:58.123
Because it's gossip, Finn.

05:58.153 --> 05:59.820
This is your fault!

05:59.887 --> 06:01.739
You told everyone that I played

06:01.823 --> 06:04.758
for another team on your
ridiculous melted cheese show.

06:04.788 --> 06:06.531
Wait. Are you mad?
You <i>do</i> play for another team.

06:06.561 --> 06:09.417
You were on the Cheerios! And now
you're only in the New Directions.

06:09.447 --> 06:11.586
And you couldn't have thought
of any other way to say that?

06:11.616 --> 06:13.705
I swear I'm going to
punch your face off!

06:13.735 --> 06:15.873
Hey, you got a lot of nerve
accusing me of cheating

06:15.903 --> 06:18.209
when you're the one who
snuck in and stole my girl!

06:18.239 --> 06:20.061
Hey! Hey, Finn, where are you going?

06:20.091 --> 06:22.026
Hey, we got rehearsal! Not today!

06:29.017 --> 06:31.051
Dinner is served.

06:31.102 --> 06:32.970
(giggles)

06:33.054 --> 06:35.193
I thought you volunteered
to make dinner.

06:35.223 --> 06:37.524
Well, Mama drinks her dinner these days!

06:37.592 --> 06:38.842
Honk!

06:38.977 --> 06:41.895
Uh... (chuckles) can I be
blunt with you, April?

06:41.946 --> 06:43.084
(Glasses clink)

06:43.114 --> 06:47.501
I think any show about April Rhodes

06:47.569 --> 06:49.765
should be about your emotional journey.

06:50.739 --> 06:52.939
Oh.

06:52.991 --> 06:54.796
Hadn't really thought of that.

06:57.128 --> 06:59.267
I forget what a good
teacher you are, Will.

06:59.297 --> 07:02.716
Thanks.

07:02.784 --> 07:04.719
And lately, I don't feel like it.

07:04.753 --> 07:06.808
I mean, there's just so much drama in

07:06.838 --> 07:08.860
the Glee Club right
now-- more than usual.

07:08.890 --> 07:11.095
A lot of whispering and
backstabbing and love triangles

07:11.125 --> 07:13.761
and questions of sexuality--

07:13.812 --> 07:16.100
Sounds like your club's
got a touch of the Mac.

07:16.130 --> 07:17.898
The what? Fleetwood Mac?

07:17.965 --> 07:19.320
They fought all the time!

07:19.350 --> 07:21.635
There was affairs and divorces

07:21.686 --> 07:23.687
and whispers and gossip.

07:23.772 --> 07:26.110
All the stuff that made
good bands break up.

07:26.140 --> 07:29.464
But they put all that drama
to good use and wrote great music.

07:29.494 --> 07:32.979
You know, I think I might have
<i>Rumours</i> on LP somewhere.

07:33.031 --> 07:34.915
Oh, everybody does.

07:34.982 --> 07:36.888
I mean, I don't. I sold mine for drugs.

07:36.918 --> 07:38.502
Kidding! Ha! Nope.

07:38.586 --> 07:40.003
I actually did that.

07:40.088 --> 07:41.505
Here we go.

07:41.589 --> 07:44.675
You know, I've wanted to
do a whole lesson devoted

07:44.759 --> 07:48.295
to a single album for a long time.

07:48.346 --> 07:51.431
You know, this is a
really good idea, April.

07:51.499 --> 07:53.801
And I'm here to help.

09:52.193 --> 09:54.845
<i>Rumours--</i> a classic
record by Fleetwood Mac.

09:54.896 --> 09:56.751
One of the greatest albums of all time.

09:56.781 --> 09:59.108
Written as the band
was breaking apart...

09:59.611 --> 10:00.698
to keep it together.

10:00.728 --> 10:04.538
Now, this week, we are done with
the backstabbing and the gossip,

10:04.622 --> 10:07.760
and we're channeling all that
energy into working together.

10:08.324 --> 10:11.361
So, pick a song from the album,
put your own spin on it.

10:11.413 --> 10:12.863
Simple as that.

10:20.649 --> 10:23.151
What's going on with you and Santana?

10:23.202 --> 10:24.369
Nothing.

10:24.453 --> 10:27.372
It doesn't sound like nothing.
It sounds like something,

10:27.402 --> 10:28.811
which is almost always
more than nothing.

10:28.841 --> 10:30.479
(Chuckles) I'm down, Artie.

10:30.509 --> 10:31.843
Are you cheating on me with her?

10:31.927 --> 10:34.691
No, of course not. I mean...
I can't. She's a girl.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.560
Fooling around with her isn't cheating.

10:36.590 --> 10:38.301
It's just friends talking with
their tongues super close.

10:38.331 --> 10:39.849
- Who told you that?
- Santana.

10:39.879 --> 10:41.911
Don't you see that
she's manipulating you?

10:41.941 --> 10:43.448
That's not cheating either.
She told me that.

10:43.478 --> 10:45.373
Do you see what's going on here?

10:45.441 --> 10:46.929
You're the hottest girl in this school,

10:47.002 --> 10:49.586
and I wear saddle shoes
on legs that don't work.

10:49.781 --> 10:52.353
This shouldn't be happening.

10:52.383 --> 10:53.985
Not because I'm in a wheelchair

10:54.104 --> 10:55.576
but because I'm obsessed
with Angry Birds

10:55.628 --> 10:56.878
and my mom cuts my hair.

10:56.945 --> 10:57.998
I like your haircut.

10:58.028 --> 11:00.307
It's hard enough for me to
believe that this is real.

11:00.426 --> 11:01.799
If I know that you spend even

11:01.829 --> 11:04.845
a little time sharing
yourself with someone else...

11:04.875 --> 11:07.679
that there's one other person in
your life that can provide

11:07.709 --> 11:10.879
for you the things that
I'm supposed to provide,

11:10.909 --> 11:14.382
it's just too much
for me to take.

11:14.412 --> 11:16.830
And Santana knows that.

11:16.860 --> 11:19.117
She's taking advantage of it
to break us up.

11:19.201 --> 11:21.736
No. Everybody thinks she's
a bad person, but she's not.

11:21.787 --> 11:23.404
God, Brittany,
why are you so stupid?!

11:27.386 --> 11:30.064
You were the only person at this school
that never called me that!

11:39.221 --> 11:42.866
(playing "Never Going
Back Again")

11:43.049 --> 11:46.978
♪ She broke down and let me in ♪

11:54.070 --> 11:57.239

13:39.092 --> 13:40.509
Stakeout.

13:40.560 --> 13:41.726
So exciting.

13:41.811 --> 13:43.512
It's like an episode
of <i>Hart to Hart.</i>

13:43.563 --> 13:45.514
No, this is not fun or cool.

13:45.565 --> 13:47.715
Then why did you agree
to do it?

13:47.767 --> 13:50.685
Because Quinn cheated
on me with Puck,

13:50.753 --> 13:52.571
and then she cheated
on Sam with me.

13:52.655 --> 13:54.940
I just want to be sure.

13:55.024 --> 13:57.526
I never understood why
you got back with her.

13:57.577 --> 14:00.228
I mean, if you can't
even trust her.

14:02.031 --> 14:05.383
I don't know.

14:05.451 --> 14:07.369
I do.

14:07.420 --> 14:09.254
Because you forgive
your first love anything.

14:12.675 --> 14:15.410
Do you believe in that
thing called karma?

14:15.461 --> 14:16.711
Uh, yeah.

14:18.197 --> 14:19.981
Can you explain it to me?

14:20.049 --> 14:23.135
Uh, well, it's the law
of physics

14:23.219 --> 14:24.603
whereby, for example,

14:24.687 --> 14:26.138
if you do something
to hurt someone,

14:26.222 --> 14:28.273
well, then the laws
of the universe will work

14:28.357 --> 14:29.641
against you until you get hurt.

14:29.725 --> 14:30.942
While we're here,
have you given

14:31.027 --> 14:32.561
any thought to my duet ideas?

14:42.071 --> 14:44.673
I can't believe Kurt
would do that to Blaine.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.418
What do we know
about Sam anyway?

14:55.469 --> 14:57.588
I mean, what town is he from?
What state?

14:58.084 --> 14:59.255
What's his old school like?

14:59.306 --> 15:01.390
Maybe he's a serial killer.
You guys,

15:01.458 --> 15:03.759
I'm telling you,
Kurt wouldn't cheat on Blaine.

15:03.810 --> 15:05.344
It's just like
the <i>Rumours</i> album.

15:05.429 --> 15:07.813
I mean, being apart or on the
road is hard for two artists.

15:07.898 --> 15:09.732
Performers have this "love the
one you're with" mentality.

15:09.799 --> 15:11.350
I mean, look at all of us.

15:11.435 --> 15:13.069
Look at all the different
combinations that we've had.

15:13.136 --> 15:14.654
Finnchel, Puckleberry.

15:14.738 --> 15:16.853
McTina Cohen Chang-Chang.
Artittany.

15:16.883 --> 15:17.973
Pizes.

15:18.289 --> 15:21.494
Guys, we're sitting here
squabbling over what? A rumor.

15:21.578 --> 15:23.440
Finn's right.
We need more information.

15:23.470 --> 15:24.613
I don't want to get into it,

15:25.113 --> 15:27.773
but all I'm gonna say...
Sam's not gay.

15:35.404 --> 15:37.525
God, I'm so sad.

15:37.555 --> 15:40.520
Like a sad little panda.

15:40.768 --> 15:42.576
Well, that's why
I brought you here...

15:42.792 --> 15:45.166
to cheer you up.

15:45.217 --> 15:47.034
I've been going through
that <i>Rumours</i> album

15:47.086 --> 15:48.682
and I found the best song
that really goes

15:48.712 --> 15:50.588
one step past "Landslide"

15:50.673 --> 15:52.974
in expressing my
feelings for you.

15:53.041 --> 15:56.377
My... private feelings.

15:56.428 --> 15:58.179
What about him?

15:58.230 --> 15:59.951
He's just furniture.

15:59.981 --> 16:01.940
Sorry. No offense.

16:01.970 --> 16:03.184
Hit it.

now that Artie and I
aren't together?

18:13.279 --> 18:14.790
No, not-not yet.

18:15.028 --> 18:18.450
I'm not ready for that type
of public announcement.

18:18.501 --> 18:20.619
Ever since
that <i>Muckraker</i> thing,

18:20.670 --> 18:23.288
people have already started
treating me differently.

18:23.340 --> 18:25.307
I got asked
to join the golf team.

18:25.736 --> 18:27.426
Well, what if I went first?

18:28.201 --> 18:30.252
Come on <i>Fondue for Two.</i>

18:30.468 --> 18:32.230
I'll ask you out to prom

18:32.260 --> 18:34.299
and I'll tell you how I feel,

18:34.351 --> 18:36.919
and all you have
to do is say yes.

18:38.545 --> 18:39.545
Okay.

18:40.059 --> 18:41.059
Yeah.

18:57.146 --> 18:58.146
Stop it.

18:58.230 --> 18:58.980
Stop what?

18:59.064 --> 19:00.531
I am begging you. Sam is cute,

19:00.599 --> 19:01.932
but he's not worth losing
Blaine over.

19:01.984 --> 19:03.568
Oh, how I've missed
your insanity.

19:03.619 --> 19:05.153
He's wearing your jacket, Kurt.

19:05.237 --> 19:07.572
I remember that jacket.
You wore it April of last year.

19:07.623 --> 19:09.240
You said it was
your Earth Day jacket

19:09.291 --> 19:11.042
because it was made out
of recycled hemp.

19:11.109 --> 19:12.543
I know how these things work.

19:12.611 --> 19:14.162
I remember when Finn
and I used to date.

19:14.246 --> 19:15.946
Sometimes he would leave his
letterman jacket at my house,

19:15.998 --> 19:17.632
and I'd wear it to
school the next day.

19:17.716 --> 19:20.284
Okay, you need to bone up on
your Fleetwood Macology.

19:20.335 --> 19:21.469
When they made <i>Rumours,</i>

19:21.553 --> 19:22.753
they weren't speaking
to each other.

19:22.805 --> 19:25.089
Not even "Pass the
nondairy creamer."

19:25.140 --> 19:27.008
They only spoke
about the music.

19:27.092 --> 19:28.593
And it was that focus
that allowed them

19:28.644 --> 19:29.793
to make their masterpiece.

19:29.845 --> 19:31.062
You're deflecting.

19:31.129 --> 19:33.231
No, I'm being a team player,
and any minute spent

19:33.298 --> 19:35.349
on this vicious, hurtful
and hateful gossip

19:35.434 --> 19:38.319
is a minute taken away
from preparing for Nationals.

19:44.827 --> 19:47.862
Why would she say that thing
about Sam not being gay?

19:47.930 --> 19:49.664
She was so sure about it.

19:49.731 --> 19:51.682
Well, they did date.

19:51.750 --> 19:54.001
Yeah, but the way
she said it--

19:54.069 --> 19:55.620
there was something
else going on.

19:55.671 --> 19:59.790
The problem with dating Quinn,
besides the mood swings,

19:59.842 --> 20:01.676
is that she's so...

20:01.760 --> 20:03.911
protective about her feelings.

20:03.979 --> 20:06.364
You never quite know where
you stand with her.

20:06.431 --> 20:08.216
Girls like that do that
to keep their power.

20:08.283 --> 20:09.617
You never did that.

20:09.685 --> 20:11.602
I always knew what
you were thinking.

Mr. Shue, thank you
for being

20:36.143 --> 20:37.276
my first interview

20:37.328 --> 20:38.494
for <i>The Muckraker.</i>
To be honest,

20:38.579 --> 20:40.346
I had no idea you were
the journalist type.

20:40.414 --> 20:42.314
Yeah, I have a talk show on
the Internet,

20:42.366 --> 20:44.250
and the comments say that
my questions are too gossipy.

20:44.318 --> 20:46.035
So I joined

20:46.120 --> 20:47.537
the school newspaper to learn

20:47.621 --> 20:48.705
to ask the more hard-hitting
questions.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.089
That's fantastic, Brittany.

20:50.157 --> 20:53.009
So, question one:
boxers or briefs?

20:54.327 --> 20:56.429
Uh, boxers.

20:56.496 --> 20:57.797
Cool.

20:57.848 --> 20:59.999
Okay, question two:
pantyhose or lace panties?

21:00.050 --> 21:02.018
I just said boxers.

21:02.102 --> 21:03.553
Yeah, well, that wasn't
one of the choices,

21:03.637 --> 21:05.288
so I'll just write that you
refused to answer the question.

21:05.356 --> 21:07.774
Brittany, these questions <i>are</i>
sort of gossipy.

21:07.841 --> 21:10.009
Okay, what age did you start
waxing your back?

21:10.060 --> 21:12.362
Brittany, I don't think these
questions are very appropriate.

21:12.446 --> 21:14.013
Well, hard-hitting journalism is
about asking the questions

21:14.064 --> 21:15.415
that people really want to know.

21:15.482 --> 21:17.784
Um, we need to address
some rumors.

21:17.851 --> 21:20.403
How many students
have you had affairs with?

21:20.487 --> 21:23.322
Wait...
There's a rumor about that?

21:23.374 --> 21:24.574
There probably will be now

21:24.658 --> 21:25.375
since you didn't really
answer the question.

21:25.459 --> 21:26.659
None!

21:26.710 --> 21:28.261
Is it the truth
or are you lying? Like when

21:28.328 --> 21:30.880
you didn't give me a straight
answer about the lacy panties.

21:30.964 --> 21:33.299
Brittany, I'm sorry, but I need
to work on some songs.

21:33.366 --> 21:35.418
Are they songs for April Rhodes'
one-woman show?

21:35.502 --> 21:37.536
Yes. Is it because you're
leaving the New Directions?

21:37.588 --> 21:40.372
What?! Because there's a rumor
that you'd rather be on Broadway

21:40.424 --> 21:41.674
than coaching the Glee Club.

21:41.725 --> 21:43.676
Brittany, who gave you
these questions to ask me?

21:43.727 --> 21:45.728
Coach Sylvester said I'm
not at liberty to say.

21:45.796 --> 21:47.764
She told me this before she
finished writing these questions.

21:47.848 --> 21:49.182
I thought so.

21:49.233 --> 21:52.985
All right, Muckrakers, the rumor
mill is up and running.

21:53.053 --> 21:54.153
On to lesson two.

21:54.221 --> 21:56.372
Making... stuff... up.

21:56.440 --> 22:00.392
Jacob, I want you to squeeze
this toothpaste into your hand.

22:00.444 --> 22:02.328
Now put it back in.

22:02.395 --> 22:03.863
Um, I can't.

22:03.914 --> 22:05.498
Exactly.

22:05.565 --> 22:08.618
Oh, no, I didn't! Oh!

22:08.702 --> 22:10.236
SUE:
Fantastic, Azimio.

22:10.287 --> 22:12.422
Now my point, ladies
and gentlemen, is that

22:12.506 --> 22:14.540
once a story is out,
it's out forever.

22:14.591 --> 22:16.542
You can't put it back in.

22:16.593 --> 22:19.212
All right, Muckrakers,
we have a deadline.

22:19.263 --> 22:20.179
(bell ringing) All right,
get out of my classroom.

22:20.247 --> 22:21.214
Get out of here!

22:21.265 --> 22:24.050
Brett.
Sue, what are you doing?

22:24.101 --> 22:25.968
Why are you spreading rumors
that I'm leaving McKinley?

22:26.053 --> 22:28.104
Well, William, I'm sure
you don't dispute

22:28.188 --> 22:30.723
that legendary bratwurst
gobbler April Rhodes is in town

22:30.774 --> 22:33.059
and you're helping her
get back to Broadway.

22:33.110 --> 22:34.610
Am I right?
Of course.

22:34.695 --> 22:35.762
But it doesn't mean
I'm leaving the school.

22:35.829 --> 22:39.098
Let me ask you
something, Will: Why?

22:39.166 --> 22:42.718
You know what they say,
"Those who can't, teach."

22:42.786 --> 22:45.621
Turns out
maybe you actually can.

22:45.706 --> 22:48.624
Think about that next time you
prop your butt chin up on

22:48.692 --> 22:50.276
one of those
tiny little face toilets.

22:50.327 --> 22:52.295
Look at it this way, Will.

22:52.379 --> 22:53.779
You'd finally be rid of me.

22:58.727 --> 23:00.395
Extra! Extra!
Read all about it!

23:00.462 --> 23:02.230
Get you <i>Muckraker</i> here!

23:02.297 --> 23:03.314
I vote for Quinn.

23:03.399 --> 23:05.516
Bite me, Fabray.

23:12.016 --> 23:12.918
Finn.

23:13.496 --> 23:14.880
Wait, why are you storming?

23:14.965 --> 23:16.999
I'm the one
who should be storming.

23:17.050 --> 23:18.851
Really? Because the way
I see it, I'm the stormer

23:18.936 --> 23:20.169
and you should be the stormee.

23:20.220 --> 23:22.171
According to today's paper,
"Finn and Rachel

23:22.222 --> 23:25.107
were seen sitting closely, laughing, talking
intimately." We were on a stakeout.

23:25.175 --> 23:27.176
What were you doing
with him in that motel?

23:27.227 --> 23:28.644
I'm not cheating on you.

23:28.695 --> 23:30.279
This time around,
I haven't and I won't.

23:30.347 --> 23:32.014
You have to learn to trust me.

23:32.065 --> 23:33.566
I can't trust you
if you won't tell me the truth.

23:33.650 --> 23:34.984
Well, what were you and Rachel
doing together, huh?

23:35.035 --> 23:37.370
Staking out. That's what
you do on a stakeout.

23:37.454 --> 23:39.238
What were you talking about?
Glee Club, okay?

23:39.323 --> 23:41.377
She wants to do
a duet with me. That's all. Trust me.

23:41.387 --> 23:43.297
Well, then I guess we both have
to learn to trust each other.

23:43.449 --> 23:46.297
- I guess so. - And I guess I know what song

Um, might want to try to smile

25:25.271 --> 25:27.122
a little bit more
next time, though.

25:27.190 --> 25:28.990
Yeah. It was lovely,
but I prefer

25:29.075 --> 25:31.059
Quinn's duet performance
of "Lucky" with Sam better.

25:31.127 --> 25:33.712
Since you and Sam have become
a lot closer lately, maybe

25:33.779 --> 25:34.779
you guys should do duets
together more often.

25:34.831 --> 25:35.881
Where is Sam?

25:35.948 --> 25:37.616
Quinn and Kurt
are both here today,

25:37.683 --> 25:38.800
so we know he's not
doing the dirty.

25:38.885 --> 25:40.585
I know what you're doing.

25:40.636 --> 25:41.837
You want Finn and I
to stop singing together

25:41.921 --> 25:43.722
so that you can sing
with him again.

25:43.789 --> 25:45.640
Frankly, yes. Finn and I have
amazing proven harmonies.

25:45.725 --> 25:46.892
And when it comes to Nationals,

25:46.959 --> 25:48.226
I think it makes more sense

25:48.294 --> 25:49.344
for him to be paired with me.

25:49.429 --> 25:50.979
Well, it's not happening.

25:51.063 --> 25:52.597
Not as long as Finn wants
to be with me.

25:52.648 --> 25:55.150
Wait, I thought you said this
relationship was about trust.

25:55.234 --> 25:58.487
Oh, I trust you.
I just don't trust her.

25:58.571 --> 25:59.821
Quinn, I don't think
you can mandate

25:59.906 --> 26:01.523
who pairs up for
Nationals, all right?

26:01.607 --> 26:03.475
Vocal Adrenaline doesn't need
any help from us.

26:03.526 --> 26:06.061
I love being here,
and I want to win,

26:06.129 --> 26:07.979
but my relationship
comes first.

26:08.047 --> 26:09.698
I'm sorry, but Finn,

26:09.782 --> 26:12.584
if you want to be with me,
no more songs with her.

26:12.651 --> 26:14.085

It was amazing progress.

27:18.568 --> 27:20.819
I mean, it was emotional,
it was funny, it was...

27:20.886 --> 27:22.354
It's you.

27:22.405 --> 27:24.155
Oh, do this with me, Will.

27:24.223 --> 27:26.074
Help me take this
show to Broadway.

27:26.158 --> 27:30.161
I'm flattered, but I have
to take the kids to Nationals.

27:30.229 --> 27:31.997
A show choir championship?

27:32.064 --> 27:33.865
Yes.
Will, that's their dream.

27:33.916 --> 27:36.117
Yes, at one point,
it was yours and mine,

27:36.202 --> 27:37.586
but look where that got us.

27:37.670 --> 27:41.423
We're standing on
the exact same stage...

28:00.893 --> 28:03.361
Welcome to <i>Fondue for Two.</i>

28:03.429 --> 28:06.565
My guest today was supposed
to be Santana,

28:06.616 --> 28:08.483
but she texted
about an hour ago,

28:08.568 --> 28:10.118
and it just said, "I can't."

28:10.202 --> 28:12.571
So, show must go on.

28:12.622 --> 28:15.373
Um, I will be interviewing
Lord Tubbington.

28:15.441 --> 28:17.075
Question one:

28:17.143 --> 28:19.327
Do you think <i>The Aristocats</i>
is an accurate portrayal

28:19.412 --> 28:21.379
of the feline relationship?

28:21.447 --> 28:22.547
(purring)

28:22.615 --> 28:24.132
You know, just because

28:24.216 --> 28:25.901
we're doing this interview
doesn't mean

28:25.968 --> 28:28.136
I'm still not mad at you.

28:28.204 --> 28:30.255
'Cause I know
you started smoking again.

28:30.306 --> 28:32.140
(purring)

28:35.886 --> 28:37.854
(school bell ringing)

28:43.773 --> 28:45.931
Emma, did you wash those grapes
at home?

28:45.941 --> 28:47.045
I just rinsed them.

28:47.055 --> 28:48.172
Yeah, I put the whole bunch

28:48.256 --> 28:49.623
in a colander,

28:49.674 --> 28:51.558
and I just let the cold water
run right over them.

28:51.626 --> 28:53.627
For a half hour or so.

28:53.678 --> 28:55.896
Still, Emma, that's amazing.

28:55.963 --> 28:57.181
I've been, um,

28:57.265 --> 28:58.932
taking my medication
for a couple of weeks.

29:00.485 --> 29:03.387
I'm so proud of you, Emma.

29:03.455 --> 29:04.805
You inspired me, Will--

29:04.873 --> 29:06.156
to make a change,

29:06.224 --> 29:09.142
to take charge
of my own destiny.

29:09.194 --> 29:11.945
And now I want the
same thing for you.

29:11.996 --> 29:14.815
Um, I don't understand.

29:14.866 --> 29:16.950
I snuck in and saw you and April
singing the other day.

29:17.001 --> 29:19.086
You're good, Will.

29:19.153 --> 29:21.955
Really, you have
a gift, you know,

29:22.023 --> 29:24.130
and if April is offering you

29:24.140 --> 29:26.208
the opportunity to use that gift

29:26.259 --> 29:29.812
on the big stage, you have to say yes.

29:29.879 --> 29:32.485
I-I can't see April's show
lighting the town on fire.

29:32.515 --> 29:35.768
Well, but it's a chance,
on a real Broadway stage.

29:36.563 --> 29:38.124
And who knows who's
gonna come and see it,

29:38.154 --> 29:39.659
what great notices you might get.

29:40.837 --> 29:42.741
You deserve to at least try this, Will.

29:45.580 --> 29:46.580
Yeah. I...

29:51.036 --> 29:52.368
I can't do that to the kids.

29:53.870 --> 29:55.921
Not now. We...

29:57.217 --> 29:59.875
We've all worked so hard,
and we're so close.

30:01.261 --> 30:02.378
(laughing)

30:02.429 --> 30:03.595
Ah.

30:03.663 --> 30:04.880
(sighs)

30:06.169 --> 30:07.619
Why are you crying?

30:10.542 --> 30:12.054
The kids.

30:15.217 --> 30:16.091
You.

30:17.511 --> 30:18.911
You all saved my life.

30:19.665 --> 30:22.431
Got me out
of a terrible marriage.

30:22.482 --> 30:24.633
You helped me find
my passion again.

30:26.769 --> 30:28.620
I just don't want to lose you.

30:31.870 --> 30:32.970
But, Emma...

30:36.329 --> 30:38.747
...I want to go so badly.

30:40.767 --> 30:41.967
(quiet laugh)

30:42.051 --> 30:44.336
(school bell rings)

30:44.421 --> 30:46.634
All right, guys.

30:46.664 --> 30:47.456
Who is up first today?

30:47.507 --> 30:50.113
RACHEL: Signor Schuester,
if it's all right with you,

30:50.143 --> 30:53.099
I'd like to do my own reinterpretation
of my favorite Fleetwood Mac song.

30:53.129 --> 30:54.480
Great, Rachel. Which one?

30:54.564 --> 30:55.797
"Go Your Own Way."

30:55.827 --> 30:57.153
It's the song about the painful breakup

30:57.183 --> 30:59.735
between Lindsay Buckingham
and Stevie Nicks.

30:59.802 --> 31:01.908
Traditionally, it's sung
by a man, but today,

31:01.938 --> 31:05.044
Rachel Berry's gonna put her own
feminine twist on it. Hit it.

33:11.101 --> 33:12.735
Brilliant! Good job, guys.

33:12.820 --> 33:16.739
QUINN: Don't you think
it's maybe a little inappropriate that

33:16.824 --> 33:19.158
you chose to sing a love song to my guy?

33:19.226 --> 33:20.276
You're such a hypocrite!

33:20.306 --> 33:21.799
You Little Miss Perfect Prom Queen!

33:21.829 --> 33:23.702
You're a cheater who cheats
in cheap motels with Sam.

33:23.732 --> 33:26.132
Nothing is going on between Sam and I.

33:26.162 --> 33:28.743
Enough, guys. You know,
I blame Sam for all of this.

33:28.773 --> 33:31.258
And Rachel, too, I blame her.
What did <i>I</i> do?

33:31.288 --> 33:32.640
I'm sure you did something.
See, I'm with Santana.

33:32.670 --> 33:35.729
I mean, why doesn't Sam have anything
to say about this? MIKE: Guilt.

33:35.759 --> 33:36.889
Seriously, dude,
what you're doing is not cool.

33:36.919 --> 33:39.549
- They both have boyfriends.
- Shut up! Look,

33:39.579 --> 33:42.205
I'm not messing around with Quinn
or Kurt or any one of those guys.

33:42.235 --> 33:44.303
- They're just helping me.
- Oh, is <i>that</i> what we're calling it now?

33:44.333 --> 33:47.419
Hold on. How were they helping you out?

33:49.574 --> 33:51.224
Kurt was bringing me
some clothes, and Quinn

33:51.254 --> 33:53.434
was helping me baby-sit my
little brother and sister.

33:53.464 --> 33:55.066
Then why were you in that motel?

33:55.096 --> 33:56.427
Because that's where I live now.

33:57.311 --> 33:59.935
My dad lost his job a few months ago,
then we lost our house, so now we live

33:59.965 --> 34:01.765
in that motel in one room.

34:02.551 --> 34:04.886
Are you all happy?

34:08.762 --> 34:10.612
The truth's finally out.

34:13.195 --> 34:14.529
(school bell rings)

34:22.556 --> 34:24.590
Thanks for the invite, ladies.

34:24.641 --> 34:27.080
You know what I call an afternoon
where I'm getting drunk?

34:27.110 --> 34:28.697
An afternoon. (Chuckling)

34:28.728 --> 34:31.067
Is there protein powder
in this margarita?

34:31.097 --> 34:33.366
And a wee bit of placenta.

34:33.433 --> 34:36.172
Well, I'd like to propose
a toast to Terri Shuester,

34:36.203 --> 34:37.436
who still cares

34:37.487 --> 34:39.956
about her ex-husband
enough to call me up

34:40.040 --> 34:42.245
and encourage me to
ask him for his help.

34:42.275 --> 34:45.244
Mm. It put a hm-mm
in my behind.

34:45.295 --> 34:48.083
But I don't think Will'll
be joining me on the tour.

34:48.114 --> 34:50.270
What? Why? Aw,
he can't leave those kids.

34:50.300 --> 34:51.420
Doesn't know how to break it to 'em.

34:51.451 --> 34:53.123
Blowsy Loads, you leave that to me.

34:53.152 --> 34:54.775
Tomorrow's <i>Muckraker</i> will include

34:54.804 --> 34:57.473
the ultimate blind-item
rumor that Will Shuester

34:57.557 --> 34:59.730
is leaving McKinley to
join you on Broadway.

34:59.760 --> 35:01.010
That's not true.

35:01.040 --> 35:02.449
It will be. That's the whole point

35:02.479 --> 35:05.297
of yellow journalism--
turning rumor into fact.

35:05.349 --> 35:06.649
And the hard part--

35:06.717 --> 35:08.822
breaking the news to the
kids-- will be over.

35:08.852 --> 35:10.490
He'll be free to follow his heart

35:10.520 --> 35:12.009
and the stench of your alcohol sweat

35:12.039 --> 35:13.522
to New York City

35:13.607 --> 35:15.111
and out of my life forever.

35:15.141 --> 35:17.193
I don't know. Seems awfully shady.

35:17.277 --> 35:19.278
And I once became an Avon lady

35:19.329 --> 35:21.168
just so I could rob demented seniors.

35:21.198 --> 35:23.599
Let's look at this way-- we all agree

35:23.667 --> 35:26.590
Will Shuester has no business
teaching in a high school.

35:26.620 --> 35:29.309
You believe he's too talented,
and I just hate him.

35:29.339 --> 35:31.345
And I just want our old apartment back.

35:31.375 --> 35:32.529
I'm living in an efficiency

35:32.559 --> 35:34.064
with a raccoon in the wall.

35:34.094 --> 35:35.182
More placenta, anyone?

35:35.212 --> 35:37.263
(knocking)

35:39.049 --> 35:41.104
Um, I'm trying to get
my sister to sleep.

35:41.134 --> 35:43.019
Dude, please, please.

35:43.103 --> 35:44.637
Just let us in.

35:44.688 --> 35:45.971
Hi. I'm Stacy.

35:46.023 --> 35:47.640
Hi, Stacy.

35:47.691 --> 35:49.058
I-I'm Rachel.

35:49.142 --> 35:50.476
This is Finn.
Hi.

35:50.527 --> 35:52.144
Well, she-she's up now.

35:55.008 --> 35:57.987
It beats a cardboard box
underneath an underpass, right?

35:58.199 --> 36:01.308
We keep the rest of our
stuff in my dad's car.

36:01.656 --> 36:05.200
- This is everything you own?
- We sold everything else.

36:06.456 --> 36:08.475
- Can we go watch TV?
- Yeah, sure.

36:08.532 --> 36:11.664
Keep it low, though. Signor Jensen,
next-door, is on the night shift again.

36:11.694 --> 36:13.816
- You want a snack?
- All right.

36:13.846 --> 36:15.237
You, too. Get over there.

36:19.156 --> 36:20.204
I...

36:20.489 --> 36:22.299
I don't understand. What happened?

36:23.137 --> 36:26.459
We moved up here from Tennessee,
you know, 'cause my dad got a great...

36:26.489 --> 36:28.223
job offer, and...

36:29.213 --> 36:32.655
the economy went to hell,
and it's last ones in, first ones out.

36:32.733 --> 36:36.799
You know, we spent all our savings on the
move and the down payment on the house.

36:38.739 --> 36:41.966
You know, when the bank takes your house,
they literally... take it.

36:41.996 --> 36:43.691
They come by one morning

36:43.824 --> 36:45.846
and kick you out of your own house,

36:46.034 --> 36:47.329
just lock you out.

36:47.748 --> 36:49.749
Why didn't you tell
us what was going on?

36:49.803 --> 36:52.217
You see how information flies
around that school, right?

36:52.279 --> 36:55.129
You think everyone would've just treated
me the same, after they found out?

36:55.289 --> 36:57.327
I'd be even more of a freak.

36:57.441 --> 36:59.331
Kurt only found out because...

36:59.427 --> 37:01.351
I got a job delivering pizzas at night

37:01.408 --> 37:03.598
- and happened to bring one to Dalton.
- Yeah...

37:03.674 --> 37:04.760
He told us.

37:04.874 --> 37:06.703
Look, I brought these for you.

37:08.059 --> 37:10.516
I know Kurt was trying
to help you out, bringing...

37:10.707 --> 37:15.121
some of his old clothes, but I don't really
think that sequined riding pants are for you.

37:15.182 --> 37:17.601
So, uh, it's some of my old stuff.

37:17.792 --> 37:18.833
Thanks.

37:19.214 --> 37:20.376
So...

37:20.909 --> 37:22.299
what about...

37:22.490 --> 37:23.576
Quinn?

37:23.937 --> 37:25.652
We go to the same church.

37:25.804 --> 37:29.330
Couldn't really hide it from her, and I kind of like
having her around to do some girl stuff with Stacy.

37:30.285 --> 37:33.798
Mom and Dad are out all day pounding
the pavement looking for work, but...

37:33.828 --> 37:34.875
Nothing.

37:35.047 --> 37:37.451
I'm not sure if I'm gonna be
able to keep on the Glee Club.

37:37.481 --> 37:39.291
What? N-No, you can't do that.

37:39.329 --> 37:41.475
Yeah, we-we've come so far,

37:41.513 --> 37:44.927
and I-I know that it's a rough time
right now, but you can't quit.

37:45.951 --> 37:47.345
You guys don't understand.

37:48.126 --> 37:49.174
Yes, we do.

38:04.231 --> 38:06.949
Quinn told us you hocked your guitar.

38:13.279 --> 38:15.258
Did you guys buy this back for me?

38:15.907 --> 38:17.651
The whole Glee Club did.

38:17.879 --> 38:20.699
Look, Sam, we'll do
whatever we can to help,

38:20.737 --> 38:24.324
anything to keep you in the Glee Club
until you get back on your feet.

38:39.997 --> 38:41.788
First time I've cried.

38:45.178 --> 38:47.654
Don't cry, Sammy.

38:48.580 --> 38:50.295
We need you, Sam.

38:51.114 --> 38:52.923
Ok? And you need the music.

38:55.418 --> 38:58.531
Any comment on the vicious rumor
left on the <i>Muckraker</i> website

38:58.561 --> 39:01.788
about you and Karofsky
doing it in the backseat

39:01.818 --> 39:03.752
of a parked car in the
Holier Than Thou Cemetery?

39:03.895 --> 39:05.038
No comment.

39:05.076 --> 39:09.417
Any comment on the fact when I looked up the I.
P. address of the person who posted the rumor

39:09.447 --> 39:11.208
I found out it was you?

39:12.066 --> 39:13.875
My computer was stolen.

39:14.332 --> 39:17.080
Look, all I can say is that
Dave and I are going strong,

39:17.137 --> 39:20.942
and we're very excited about our
Prom King and Queen campaign.

39:21.080 --> 39:23.784
- Vote Santofsky.
- So you two are in love?

39:23.880 --> 39:25.633
Soul mates, so to speak?

39:28.871 --> 39:29.880
Yeah.

39:32.395 --> 39:33.918
I'd say that was accurate.

39:41.613 --> 39:43.175
All right, <i>clase.</i>

39:43.271 --> 39:44.446
Mr. Shue, is this true?

39:44.514 --> 39:47.417
Yeah, the <i>Muckraker</i> says you're
bailing on us to do April Rhodes' big show.

39:47.447 --> 39:48.476
Guys...

39:48.650 --> 39:52.417
if there's anything we've learned from this week's assignment,
it's that you can't believe every rumor you hear.

39:52.447 --> 39:54.904
But isn't it your dream
to sing on Broadway?

39:55.114 --> 39:56.466
I have a lot of dreams.

39:56.581 --> 39:58.080
My top one...

39:58.480 --> 40:00.004
being taking you guys
to Nationals.

40:00.118 --> 40:03.193
- So you're gonna stay?
- Look, we are going to Nationals, together,

40:03.223 --> 40:04.633
and we are going to win.

40:04.690 --> 40:05.843
Hey, everybody.

40:05.873 --> 40:09.109
Kind of wanted to get these guys out of the motel for
a little while-- I hope it's ok if I brought them.

40:09.139 --> 40:12.243
- Of course, of course. Yeah, come on in.
- I was also hoping that maybe...

40:12.472 --> 40:14.129
they could help out with a number today.

40:14.159 --> 40:16.242
I have the perfect song
I want to sing to them,

40:16.272 --> 40:18.400
and don't worry, it's good
for the assignment, Mr. Shue.

40:19.048 --> 40:20.508
The more the merrier.
