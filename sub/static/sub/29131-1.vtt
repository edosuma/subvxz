Where do you think you're going,

05:29.151 --> 05:31.955
Christ, he's
got you down, so he has.

05:32.355 --> 05:34.254
That's scary. Don't do that.

05:34.256 --> 05:37.261
Anyway, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm having my dinner wi' yous.

Hello, Marion!

06:44.927 --> 06:46.196
Night, both of you.

06:51.567 --> 06:53.634
She looks good. Amanda.

06:53.636 --> 06:57.038
Aye. So she should. Enough time at it.

06:57.040 --> 07:00.173
- Does she still lie out here on tin foil?
- Oh, aye.

07:00.175 --> 07:02.343
One peek of the sun and
that one's in a bikini.

07:02.345 --> 07:05.012
- Other day she was in after my butter.
- Your butter?

07:05.014 --> 07:08.284
Puts it all over her.
"It's natural, Marion."

07:09.018 --> 07:11.084
Aye, natural if you're a roll.

07:20.463 --> 07:22.362
Mary was gonna come tonight to see you,

07:22.364 --> 07:24.464
but she's awful bad
with her arthritis, so...

07:24.466 --> 07:26.701
- Oh, that's a shame.
- Aye.

07:26.703 --> 07:30.207
It's in her knees now so
that's her had to retire.

07:32.708 --> 07:34.078

07:36.146 --> 07:38.648

07:46.122 --> 07:47.988
Why, what were you thinking?

07:47.990 --> 07:49.557

07:49.559 --> 07:52.492
I wasnae thinking. I've just got
out. Don't you worry about me.

07:52.494 --> 07:55.165
No, I wasnae. I was
thinking about your kids.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.036
I'm going to Nashville.

08:00.670 --> 08:01.935
Well, you better mind your tag doesnae

08:01.937 --> 08:05.173
First thing I'm going down the
Opry I'm gonna get my job back

08:05.175 --> 08:06.542
and I'm gonna work for it.

08:07.177 --> 08:08.675
There's nothing for me here.

08:08.677 --> 08:11.411
There I can be honing my
craft, out gigging every night.

08:11.413 --> 08:12.646
Honing your cra...?

08:12.648 --> 08:15.249
Do you not think you've
sacrificed enough for that fantasy?

08:15.251 --> 08:17.752
- Have we all not sacrificed enough?
- How's it a fantasy?

08:17.754 --> 08:19.721
- It's the only thing I'm good at.
- Learn a trade.

08:19.723 --> 08:21.456
- Go to college.
- You're not listening.

08:21.458 --> 08:23.156
I don't care what you do, but do something.

08:23.158 --> 08:25.192
I've got my talent and I'm gonna use that.

08:25.194 --> 08:29.365

I hear you're on the tag.

10:01.190 --> 10:02.492

10:18.540 --> 10:20.408
Christ, yous must be desperate!

10:20.410 --> 10:22.876
Nobody wants to see a
convicted criminal up there.

10:22.878 --> 10:25.312
Folk come here to get away from all that.

10:25.314 --> 10:27.715
Johnny Cash was a convicted
criminal, you bawbag.

10:27.717 --> 10:30.118
Anyway, away back to your mousetraps.

10:30.120 --> 10:33.287
I need this job, Jackie,
and it's my fucking band.

10:33.289 --> 10:36.890
It's the house band. You're
your own worst enemy, you.

10:36.892 --> 10:39.796
I wouldnae agree. There's
strong competition.

10:40.429 --> 10:43.163

10:43.165 --> 10:45.899

10:47.703 --> 10:49.570

11:51.200 --> 11:52.832

11:54.670 --> 11:56.870
And then they bought the house next door.

Pleasure. Speak to you later. Bye.

13:35.737 --> 13:38.839
Hello! I'm Susannah.

13:38.841 --> 13:40.474
- Hi.
- Thanks for coming.

13:40.476 --> 13:43.677
So, um... where have you
been working before now?

13:43.679 --> 13:46.681
She's been up in Stirling.
Haven't you, Rose-Lynn?

13:46.683 --> 13:48.749
But she's no plans to go back.

13:48.751 --> 13:51.585
- Oh, it's beautiful up there.
- Majestic.

13:51.587 --> 13:52.756
Yeah.

13:53.756 --> 13:56.459
Right, I'm off to spend a penny.

14:02.931 --> 14:04.834
So, it's £12 an hour.

14:05.668 --> 14:07.368
Twelve? Actually, Mary gets...

14:07.370 --> 14:09.570
Eight pound? Right, but...
she can afford to go that low

14:09.572 --> 14:11.038
because she's on the brew as well.

14:11.040 --> 14:13.106
Brew? She drinks?

14:13.108 --> 14:14.908
- I don't think Mary drinks.
- No, no.

14:14.910 --> 14:16.713
The brew is like, you know, the dole.

14:17.814 --> 14:19.913
- Really?
- Mm, yeah, yeah.

14:19.915 --> 14:22.450
Whereas I'll not be up
to anything like that.

14:22.452 --> 14:24.618
It's just not me. Know what I mean?

14:24.620 --> 14:26.787
Don't embarrass her by mentioning it.

14:26.789 --> 14:29.657
Oh, you were needing more bleach, Susannah.

14:29.659 --> 14:31.759
I'll give you the receipt for it.

14:31.761 --> 14:32.662
Oh, okay. Thanks.

14:52.915 --> 14:54.418

14:56.551 --> 14:58.087

14:58.854 --> 15:02.155
Um, I'm just gonna pop out and...

15:02.157 --> 15:05.058
- I'll be back in about an hour, okay?
- Okay.

15:05.060 --> 15:07.827
Or... or maybe less.

15:07.829 --> 15:11.432
I'm in and out all day so I don't
know when I'll be back. Just...

15:11.434 --> 15:13.804

Well, are yous coming in?

18:01.236 --> 18:03.136
There's a yeasty smell in here.

18:03.138 --> 18:04.771
<i>What kind of smell is it?</i>

18:04.773 --> 18:07.307
- Yeasty.
- <i>What smell?</i>

18:07.309 --> 18:10.844
Well, I don't know, but it sure as
hell isnae somebody baking bread.

18:10.846 --> 18:13.250
<i>Hang on a minute.</i>

18:13.915 --> 18:16.983
She won't touch ham and
he won't eat anything but,

18:16.985 --> 18:19.655
and they've both now decided
they don't like yoghurt.

18:20.856 --> 18:23.624
Have you got a calendar?
You need a calendar.

18:23.626 --> 18:24.991
For putting down their gym days

18:24.993 --> 18:27.861
and their holidays and if they're
needing to bring something in.

18:27.863 --> 18:29.896
Nine times out of ten
they willnae tell you,

18:29.898 --> 18:32.165
so you need to go through
their bags once a week

18:32.167 --> 18:33.567
and you need to pay these.

18:33.569 --> 18:37.671
You can do it. You've got a wage
now and you can pay in instalments.

18:37.673 --> 18:40.307
Your gas, your water
and your electricity...

18:40.309 --> 18:41.711
and...

18:42.243 --> 18:43.914
your TV licence as well.

18:44.847 --> 18:48.082
Okay-smokey. Well, that's you set up here.

18:48.084 --> 18:50.617
Remember, you have to be
in immediate range of that

18:50.619 --> 18:53.188
from 7.00 at night until
7.00 in the morning, okay?

18:53.789 --> 18:56.092
Hello?

18:56.325 --> 18:57.327
- Hi?
- Excuse me?

18:58.261 --> 19:00.297
- Hi. Yeah?
- Is that your wee boy out here?

19:02.397 --> 19:05.265
- Lyle?
- Open up, it's the police!

19:05.267 --> 19:08.268
- Lyle? Lyle!
- Hi-ya!

19:08.270 --> 19:09.772
- Hi...
- Get in here.

19:10.172 --> 19:11.675
Right now!

19:21.216 --> 19:22.953
Right, that's me away.

19:26.955 --> 19:28.422
You know where I am...

19:28.424 --> 19:29.960
if you need me.

19:38.800 --> 19:41.037
No, no, you're staying
here with your mammy.

19:41.302 --> 19:43.305
But you'll see me every day.

19:43.905 --> 19:47.242
You'll see me every day, dafty.

19:48.243 --> 19:51.144
I'm coming home with you.

19:51.146 --> 19:53.881
No, you stay with
your mammy. Now, be a good boy.

19:53.883 --> 19:55.848
Come on, take hold of him now.

19:55.850 --> 19:57.654
Take hold of him.

19:58.053 --> 20:00.253
Come on. Shh, shh.

20:00.255 --> 20:02.722
I want to go with my granny!

20:02.724 --> 20:04.290
No, you don't. Shh, shh.

20:04.292 --> 20:07.664
Come on, Lyle.

20:08.864 --> 20:10.800
I don't wanna stay here!

20:34.356 --> 20:36.760
See, on Friday, will we
go out for our dinner?

20:40.762 --> 20:42.064
I remember what your favourite is.

20:43.965 --> 20:45.267
It's pizza.

20:47.036 --> 20:49.803
I like sausage, cheese, tomato.

20:49.805 --> 20:51.675
She likes cheese, tomato and cheese.

20:52.774 --> 20:54.343
Are you coming with us?

20:55.911 --> 20:56.946
Hmm?

21:12.027 --> 21:14.963
- Right, that's me away.
- Okay.

21:16.799 --> 21:18.902
The kids tell me you're a
country and western singer.

21:19.367 --> 21:20.803
Are you taking the piss?

21:21.837 --> 21:24.741
No! No, not at all. Why do you say that?

21:24.973 --> 21:28.845
Country and western? No, it's just country.

21:29.544 --> 21:31.013
Oh, I didn't realise.

21:32.482 --> 21:34.850
You must be very good because all
I've heard all week is "Rose-Lynn."

21:36.217 --> 21:39.419
- Why country?
- 'Cause it's three chords and the truth.

21:47.029 --> 21:48.162
Wow.

21:48.164 --> 21:52.001
And it goes like that, just
gets whatever's in there out.

21:54.869 --> 21:57.003
Anyways, I'll see you next week.

21:57.005 --> 21:58.806
Thanks very much. Bye.

21:58.808 --> 22:00.009
Bye.

22:07.116 --> 22:08.917
All right. Thanks.

22:11.086 --> 22:12.756
Oh, sorry. After you.

22:13.454 --> 22:15.023
Him, that fucking prick.

22:18.828 --> 22:20.230
Shit. Sorry, mate. Fuck.

22:21.062 --> 22:22.431
- Get out!
- Fuck.

22:23.232 --> 22:25.598
- Oh, sorry, pal. Sorry.
- Watch yourself.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.968
Ah, don't worry about it. It's fine.

22:27.970 --> 22:29.405
I'm all right, Davey.

22:30.838 --> 22:33.874
- That's me. You fucking idiot!
- No, no, no. I just fell on the floor.

22:33.876 --> 22:36.042
- Where you going?
- I've got my curfew.

22:36.044 --> 22:38.077
Never mind the curfew. Come on, stay.

22:38.079 --> 22:39.482
- Drink mine.
- Stay. Oi!

22:47.121 --> 22:48.457
Fuck!

23:12.047 --> 23:14.851
Hello. Galloways the
butcher's. What can I get you?

23:15.517 --> 23:18.221
Yeah, I'm playing with you.
I'm only kidding you on.

23:19.221 --> 23:21.922
Aye, yeah, Rose-Lynn Harlan.

23:21.924 --> 23:23.257
I'm here.

23:23.259 --> 23:24.961
All right, okay, bye.

23:26.060 --> 23:27.963
- Oh...
- What happened to pizza?

23:35.671 --> 23:39.239
You cannae promise them
something and then just disappear.

23:39.241 --> 23:41.544
- You cannae do that.
- I didnae disappear.

23:42.344 --> 23:45.077
I was at my work, waiting on my wages.

23:45.079 --> 23:48.481
Please! You're not
fooling anybody, Rose-Lynn.

23:48.483 --> 23:50.182
And you cannae fool me.

23:50.184 --> 23:53.386
See, you tell them something,
you don't go back on it.

23:53.388 --> 23:55.123
That's basic.

23:55.991 --> 23:57.292
That's basic.

23:58.927 --> 24:01.263
Right, pizza. Come on.

24:10.105 --> 24:11.507
You don't like pizza.

24:13.341 --> 24:15.277

I'm needing to raise a couple of

26:33.648 --> 26:36.115
I cannae drive, so I'm
needing a driver as well.

26:36.117 --> 26:39.088

three, definitely less than five.

- No, it was.

26:51.200 --> 26:53.403
- I can't do that.
- How no'?

26:54.168 --> 26:55.868
I'm not being funny, but I just thought

26:55.870 --> 26:58.270
with all the smelly
candles burning everywhere

26:58.272 --> 27:01.340
and bottled water and all
that, you wouldnae miss it.

27:01.342 --> 27:03.876

I've saved up, whereas you...

27:03.878 --> 27:06.214
I mean, yous could just
drink out of the tap.

27:09.417 --> 27:10.819
Anyways, never mind.

27:16.791 --> 27:19.826
What are you actually doing...
while you're waiting, saving to go?

27:19.828 --> 27:24.166

Glasgow's Grand Ole Opry since I was 14.

27:24.465 --> 27:26.532
- And?
- And what?

27:26.534 --> 27:28.103
Nothing.

27:28.904 --> 27:31.505
Why haven't you gone in for
one of those TV talent shows?

27:31.507 --> 27:33.039
They're no' for folk who can sing.

27:33.041 --> 27:37.711
They're for folk who want to sit in
with their saag aloo and watch the telly.

27:37.713 --> 27:41.181
Isn't it a way of meeting someone here
who can introduce you to someone there?

27:41.183 --> 27:43.185
There's nobody here. That's why I'm away.

27:45.453 --> 27:48.390

27:48.857 --> 27:50.390

- Except you?

27:50.392 --> 27:52.095
Yeah. And Bob Harris.

27:52.761 --> 27:54.163
Who's that?

27:55.430 --> 27:57.396

music. All the stars, they're his pals.

just away and pop round his house!

31:08.357 --> 31:09.658
Thanks.

31:11.059 --> 31:13.058
So, where do you stay, Rose-Lynn?

31:13.060 --> 31:14.527
Priesthill.

31:14.529 --> 31:16.663
- Ah, Pollok way.
- Aye, yeah.

31:16.665 --> 31:19.068
- Sam's from Clydebank.
- Clydebank?

31:19.667 --> 31:22.737
How did you get here from
Clydebank, break in through a window?

31:23.805 --> 31:27.874
Learned a trade from my father
and then I started up on my own.

31:27.876 --> 31:29.578
Aye? What trade?

31:34.515 --> 31:35.749
Conservatories?

31:35.751 --> 31:38.487
Is that they big glass things
stuck on the side of houses?

31:38.787 --> 31:42.020
I'm no' being funny, but who
needs a conservatory in Glasgow?

31:42.022 --> 31:44.958
- You'd be surprised.
- Oh, aye, I would be.

31:44.960 --> 31:47.093
- What are you looking for?
- iPad.

31:47.095 --> 31:49.762
- Did Mum say you can have it? No?
- No.

31:49.764 --> 31:52.432
Tell you what, let's go
play some football, eh?

31:52.434 --> 31:54.436
Oh, you're getting heavy, boy.

31:58.139 --> 32:00.642
- Do you want kids, Rose-Lynn?
- Aye, yeah.

32:04.178 --> 32:05.747
Just not yet.

32:20.796 --> 32:22.064
How was school today?

32:25.200 --> 32:29.638
Is Mrs Pat still there?
Oh, she hated me, Mrs Pat.

32:32.607 --> 32:34.609
Is Miss McDonald still your favourite?

32:37.479 --> 32:39.081
Miss McDonald left.

34:44.804 --> 34:46.605
- You hungry?
- Mm-hmm.

34:46.607 --> 34:47.810
Hmm?

35:01.289 --> 35:02.624
I've got something.

35:03.325 --> 35:06.859
"Dear Susannah, so wonderful to
hear from you after all this time.

35:06.861 --> 35:11.000
I passed your email on to Liz.
Remember Liz used to piss in the sink?"

35:11.332 --> 35:14.734
She, um... Oh, she works on
the <i>Today</i> programme

35:14.736 --> 35:18.071
and she sent the link to her
husband who covers sport for Radio 2

35:18.073 --> 35:20.640
and he forwarded the link
to Bob Harris's producer.

35:20.642 --> 35:22.241
Oh, my God!

35:22.243 --> 35:24.644
- Oh, my fucking God!
- Wait.

35:24.646 --> 35:27.714
"Bob would be very happy to meet her
if she fancied coming down to London

35:27.716 --> 35:28.915
to watch a live recording."

35:28.917 --> 35:31.283
Do you know how many times
I've written to that wee bastard

35:31.285 --> 35:33.621
and how many BBC pens I got back in return?

35:34.356 --> 35:36.859
How did you do that? How
did you even fucking do that?

35:37.191 --> 35:39.625
- Sent a few emails.
- I cannae be...

35:39.627 --> 35:42.261
I cannae believe it. I'm fucking shaking.

35:42.263 --> 35:45.263
- That is just...
- Oh.

35:45.265 --> 35:48.836
Thank you, thank you. That
is fucking mental. Brilliant!

35:49.203 --> 35:50.772
Whoo!

35:51.006 --> 35:52.774
Bob Harris?

35:53.107 --> 35:54.941
Whispering Bob Harris?

36:00.347 --> 36:02.415
Aye, I know, I know. It's mad.

36:02.417 --> 36:05.051
That would be some doors
he could open for you.

36:05.053 --> 36:07.089
Is... Is it all right if you babysit?

36:07.421 --> 36:09.357
Oh, of course she will.

36:10.992 --> 36:13.261
- How did this come about?
- Susannah.

36:13.727 --> 36:16.863
Oh. Very nice of her to help you.

36:16.865 --> 36:18.934
Can she unlock tags as well?

36:22.370 --> 36:23.672
You served 12 months

36:24.372 --> 36:29.111
for attempting to smuggle a
package of heroin into Cornton Vale

36:29.778 --> 36:31.877
by throwing it over the perimeter fence.

36:31.879 --> 36:33.348
I didnae know it was heroin.

36:34.249 --> 36:37.785
But you were reckless as to
what the package contained.

36:38.053 --> 36:41.656
If you mean, was I off my face and
didnae ask what was in it, then aye.

36:42.022 --> 36:44.691
I had wains and everything
and they give me the jail.

36:44.693 --> 36:45.926
Pure ridiculous.

36:45.928 --> 36:49.263
That's what my advocate said at
the time... it's no' my fault.

36:50.265 --> 36:52.100
Well, whose fault was it?

36:53.267 --> 36:56.070
Well, it was the judge's, obviously,
for giving me the sentence.

36:59.274 --> 37:00.676
Your Lordship,

37:01.810 --> 37:04.780
a more contrite young lady
it would be hard to find.

37:05.879 --> 37:09.015
Ms Harlan has done a
lot of soul-searching.

37:09.017 --> 37:11.886
She has... dug deep.

37:13.120 --> 37:15.758
And she's put her childish ways behind her.

37:16.124 --> 37:18.727
She now works full-time as a daily woman

37:18.993 --> 37:21.997
and her children are
living with her once again.

37:22.897 --> 37:26.432
Though Ms Harlan is no longer in prison,

37:26.434 --> 37:28.468
neither is she free.

37:28.470 --> 37:32.205
Wearing a tag means she is
unable to seek employment

37:32.207 --> 37:33.772
in her own line of work.

37:33.774 --> 37:36.008
- You just told me she's a daily woman.
- Yes.

37:36.010 --> 37:37.845
But if you turn the page, sir...

37:38.979 --> 37:41.115
you'll see my client is also

37:41.448 --> 37:44.183

and western singer.

37:44.185 --> 37:46.451
Oh, for God's sake.

37:49.057 --> 37:50.290
It's just "country."

38:10.410 --> 38:11.979

- Bob Harris.

44:38.298 --> 44:40.299
- Have you got any ID?
- No.

44:40.301 --> 44:43.169
No, some bastard stole my
bag on the way here, so no.

44:43.171 --> 44:44.937
Right. I'm gonna need you to sign in.

44:44.939 --> 44:46.540
What, is it MI5 here?

44:47.374 --> 44:49.710
Jeez, they give you less
hassle in the police station.

44:50.310 --> 44:51.877
- Are you Rose-Lynn?
- Aye.

44:51.879 --> 44:53.511
Hello. I'm Mark, Bob's producer.

44:53.513 --> 44:56.247
Oh, jeez, it's so good to see you, boy.

44:56.249 --> 44:58.183
You got here, then?

44:58.185 --> 44:59.651
Aye, I did.

44:59.653 --> 45:02.187
So, the studio is through here,

45:02.189 --> 45:05.290
and... round here is our control room

45:05.292 --> 45:07.461
and in the control room is Bob Harris.

45:11.966 --> 45:16.368
- You must be Rose-Lynn.
- I cannae believe it's you. Oh!

45:16.370 --> 45:19.238
Honest to God, I thought you'd be tiny wee.

45:21.841 --> 45:24.776
Oh, is that where they go,
Miranda Lambert and all that?

45:24.778 --> 45:27.348
- All they folk who come in here?
- It is, yeah.

45:27.647 --> 45:30.352
And we've got someone
fabulous playing later.

45:30.618 --> 45:32.386
Would you like to have a look around?

45:34.888 --> 45:39.225
So, this is very exciting,
meeting a home-grown country star.

45:39.227 --> 45:41.926
From Glasgow! I mean, it's
a great music city, Glasgow.

45:41.928 --> 45:45.497
Oh, yeah? I'm trying to get
to Nashville, obviously, but...

45:45.499 --> 45:48.399
I mean, who's ever heard of
a country singer from Glasgow?

45:48.401 --> 45:50.704
That's ridiculous. It cannae be.

45:51.004 --> 45:52.374
Why not?

45:54.341 --> 45:55.575
Well...

45:55.577 --> 45:59.678
See my life? My life's like
being one of these transsexuals.

45:59.680 --> 46:03.716
You know? When you're born a man, but
you were meant to come out a lassie.

46:03.718 --> 46:06.488
Yeah, that is me. I should
have been born in America.

46:07.021 --> 46:09.457
I'm an American, but here I am.

46:10.957 --> 46:12.691
- Do you write?
- Oh, no.

46:12.693 --> 46:15.828
- Can you play?
- No.

46:15.830 --> 46:17.595

Scotland or Glasgow, Kentucky

I left it on her back seat.

48:03.636 --> 48:05.136
- Was it good?
- Aye.

48:08.943 --> 48:10.477
What like was it? London.

48:10.944 --> 48:13.078
- It was hoaching.
- Oh, that's what Mary said.

48:13.080 --> 48:15.413

48:28.696 --> 48:30.098

48:30.731 --> 48:33.100
He was saying I'm needing

48:34.502 --> 48:37.806

48:50.517 --> 48:51.752
you can do anything.

48:56.756 --> 48:59.792
- Do you want a cup of tea?
- Oh, no. I'm away to my bed.

48:59.794 --> 49:01.529

49:07.100 --> 49:08.869

49:17.544 --> 49:19.380
My mince is your mince.

49:22.015 --> 49:23.050
Night.

49:36.729 --> 49:38.766
- Did I wake you up?
- No.

49:39.165 --> 49:40.934
I wanted some water.

49:48.876 --> 49:50.611

49:52.178 --> 49:53.881

51:31.178 --> 51:32.680
What will we do, eh?

51:32.979 --> 51:35.948
We'll go away for a few days, to the beach.

51:35.950 --> 51:38.218
- I've not went to the beach.
- Yeah, you have.

51:38.852 --> 51:40.622

51:41.287 --> 51:42.856
We went just before...

51:44.725 --> 51:46.895
just before yous moved in with your granny.

51:47.928 --> 51:50.598
You wanted to pick up all
the shells. Remember that?

51:58.171 --> 52:00.207
How come we werenae allowed to see you?

52:02.075 --> 52:04.545
'Cause your granny didn't
want you coming to the jail.

52:05.979 --> 52:07.645
Who else was gonna bring you?

52:07.647 --> 52:09.348
'Cause of baddies?

52:09.350 --> 52:10.448
Aye, uh-huh.

52:10.450 --> 52:13.186
You werenae a baddie,
though. You were an outlaw.

52:14.321 --> 52:16.223
- Who told you that?
- You did.

52:20.760 --> 52:22.596
No, I wasnae an outlaw.

52:25.932 --> 52:27.732
I was a fanny.

52:27.734 --> 52:29.202
You said fanny!

52:40.981 --> 52:43.915
How was it? I tried
calling you so many times.

52:43.917 --> 52:47.785
- Oh, I know. I lost my phone.
- No! What happened?

52:49.189 --> 52:51.390
- Actually, it got pinched.
- Oh, really?

52:51.392 --> 52:53.892
Yeah, out of my bag, with my bag.

52:53.894 --> 52:56.363
- Crap.
- Didnae matter.

52:57.131 --> 53:00.232
- It was fucking-A!
- Was it?

53:00.234 --> 53:01.235
Really?

53:02.336 --> 53:06.004
I'm gonna get there. I am
gonna fucking get there.

53:06.006 --> 53:07.375
Yes, you bloody are.

53:08.107 --> 53:09.843
- Listen.
- Yeah?

53:10.443 --> 53:12.980
I'm gonna be 50 in a minute and...

53:13.347 --> 53:17.214
I was gonna have this drinks party for
which I've got very little enthusiasm for.

53:17.216 --> 53:20.852
'Cause over the weekend I realised
what I really need is a "party" party,

53:20.854 --> 53:23.888
a great big fuck-off house party,

53:23.890 --> 53:28.061
featuring, say, a set by... a
young up-and-coming country singer,

53:28.696 --> 53:30.127
Rose-Lynn Harlan.

53:30.129 --> 53:32.229
What? You want me to play at your party?

53:32.231 --> 53:33.333
Yeah. Will you?

53:34.435 --> 53:37.069
- Well, aye, yeah, course I will.
- That is brilliant.

53:37.071 --> 53:38.870
That is not the exciting bit.

53:38.872 --> 53:42.006
The exciting bit is,
instead of bringing gifts,

53:42.008 --> 53:46.647
people will contribute to a cause
that is very close to my heart... you.

53:46.979 --> 53:48.379
You perform a set.

53:48.381 --> 53:51.015
If people like what they
hear, which they will,

53:51.017 --> 53:53.118
then they invest in you, in your career.

53:53.120 --> 53:58.026
That's, like, a hundred people
spending between £50 and £100.

53:58.392 --> 53:59.924
Voilà.

53:59.926 --> 54:02.729
By the magic of
crowd-funding, you are there.

54:03.030 --> 54:04.995
- Where?
- The Isle of Man.

54:04.997 --> 54:06.367
Nashville!

54:07.834 --> 54:10.671
What, you're gonna tax your
pals to come to your house

54:10.937 --> 54:12.738
for an audience with your daily woman?

54:12.740 --> 54:14.105
Yeah.

54:14.107 --> 54:17.111
You've lost the plot, hen!

54:19.747 --> 54:21.912
- Oh, do you have a band?
- Aye, yeah, course I do.

54:21.914 --> 54:23.448
- When is it?
- Next Sunday.

54:23.450 --> 54:26.220
You've already booked the week off,
and you can use that time to rehearse.

54:26.886 --> 54:31.423
Oh, no. No, I cannae do that week. But
it's cool, I don't need to rehearse.

54:31.425 --> 54:33.325
I've been playing with
these guys since I was 14.

54:33.327 --> 54:35.963
Rose-Lynn, you definitely
need to rehearse.

54:36.162 --> 54:37.664
If you're asking people for money, if...

54:38.332 --> 54:42.000
If you want people to buy in to the
idea that you're gonna make it out there,

54:42.002 --> 54:45.173
then you need to put in a
really professional performance.

54:46.973 --> 54:49.209
Oh, yeah, cool, yeah. Fucking-A.

54:50.209 --> 54:51.475
Brilliant.

54:51.477 --> 54:52.780
Whoo!

54:57.818 --> 54:58.919
Well...

54:59.919 --> 55:01.254
I cannae fault it.

55:10.464 --> 55:11.799
Mum?

55:13.100 --> 55:15.267
- Susannah's needing me in next week.
- She cannae have you.

55:15.269 --> 55:18.136
Kids are on holiday. She can
do without you for a week.

55:18.138 --> 55:19.638
You said you'd take them away.

55:19.640 --> 55:23.511
Well, it's no', uh... it's no'
cleaning I'd be doing, it's rehearsing.

55:23.977 --> 55:25.843
I'm doing this gig at her house.

55:25.845 --> 55:28.815
She's invited all these people
and I'm gonna perform with my band.

55:29.182 --> 55:31.418
And then they're gonna invest.

55:31.919 --> 55:33.855
Invest? Invest in what?

55:35.189 --> 55:37.425
In me, in my career,

55:38.091 --> 55:40.091
in getting to Nashville.

55:40.093 --> 55:41.162
Oh.

55:42.729 --> 55:46.497
I don't remember her investing in Mary
when she was in agony with her hip.

55:46.499 --> 55:47.732
Eighteen-month waiting list.

55:47.734 --> 55:50.167
If she'd money to spare, she
could have forked out on that.

55:50.169 --> 55:52.039
She isnae forking it out.

55:53.106 --> 55:55.073
She's giving me a chance to earn it.

55:55.075 --> 55:58.142
But it's got to be good, no pub band.
We havenae long to put it together.

55:58.144 --> 56:01.145
I phoned the school to see about
holiday club, but it's all full up,

56:01.147 --> 56:04.850
and I'd rather they were with you
'cause I don't want them thinking...

56:04.852 --> 56:05.950
Thinking what?

56:05.952 --> 56:08.319
That you cast them off
when you get a better offer?

56:08.321 --> 56:12.026
Or that all this is for nothing 'cause
you've still got one foot out the door?

56:16.062 --> 56:17.298
I cannae help you.

56:18.231 --> 56:19.800
I havenae booked the time off.

56:21.033 --> 56:22.803
You've been there 20 year.

56:24.338 --> 56:27.339
- Special circumstances.
- I've used that enough.

56:27.341 --> 56:29.010
Aye, when I was fucking up.

56:30.077 --> 56:31.609
What's for you will no' go by you.

56:31.611 --> 56:33.611
This is me trying to
make something of myself.

56:33.613 --> 56:36.013
Surely to God that's a good thing for them.

56:36.015 --> 56:37.482
A good thing for them?

56:37.484 --> 56:41.553
No' letting them down
again and again and again,

56:41.555 --> 56:43.591
that would be a good thing for them.

56:44.423 --> 56:46.293
And I thought you'd turned a corner.

56:46.593 --> 56:48.162
More fool me!

56:58.104 --> 57:00.504
- Where are we going?
- To the beach.

57:00.506 --> 57:04.345
We're going to go into the sea
and look at different jellyfish.

57:06.546 --> 57:09.116
Come on. That's a good boy. Come on.

57:11.218 --> 57:12.520
Here we go.

57:15.488 --> 57:17.189
Oh, in yous come.

57:17.191 --> 57:19.124
I don't want to go in there!

57:19.126 --> 57:21.593
Mary's gonna look after you
for a wee while this week, okay?

57:21.595 --> 57:24.999
I didn't say a week,
Rose-Lynn, I said today.

57:26.232 --> 57:28.269
Oh, you're fine, you're fine.

57:29.035 --> 57:31.037
Come on. Mum'll be back. You'll be fine.

59:48.107 --> 59:51.345
Wow, who else has this
lassie invested in? Rod Stewart?

59:54.381 --> 59:58.419
Right, now, it's been a long
time, but I do love a call sheet.

59:59.118 --> 01:00:03.220
So, if you could all be
here from 4.00 tomorrow,

01:00:03.222 --> 01:00:06.624
then we'll run sound check from 4.30,

01:00:06.626 --> 01:00:09.530
and after that... we'll
go to the lighting cues.

01:00:10.763 --> 01:00:15.433
Big day tomorrow, gents. This
girl has cleaned her last floor.

01:00:17.370 --> 01:00:19.270
Leave it. You
don't have to do that.

01:00:19.272 --> 01:00:22.576
No, it's all right. I'll just...
I'll just pop them inside.

01:00:28.714 --> 01:00:30.283
I nicked it from the tech guys.

01:00:31.350 --> 01:00:32.586
Fancy a smoke?

01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:35.520
Oh, no, I've... I've got to go.

01:00:35.522 --> 01:00:37.058
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:00:37.857 --> 01:00:39.359
Can you roll it?

01:00:42.562 --> 01:00:44.131
When I first met Sam,

01:00:44.664 --> 01:00:48.334
we lived in this shittiest
little flat on Clydeside.

01:00:48.767 --> 01:00:51.304
There was nothing there,
not like it is now.

01:00:51.604 --> 01:00:53.705
We had rats because of the river,

01:00:53.707 --> 01:00:55.707
we were broken into nearly once a week,

01:00:55.709 --> 01:01:00.247
but we had these really,
really amazing parties.

01:01:03.716 --> 01:01:05.185
Don't really want this.

01:01:06.919 --> 01:01:10.555
- Do you have someone?
- No, I'm... free as a bird.

01:01:10.557 --> 01:01:11.792
Lucky you.

01:01:15.461 --> 01:01:16.629
You're young.

01:01:17.997 --> 01:01:21.101
You're incredibly talented. You're
at the height of your powers.

01:01:21.834 --> 01:01:23.570
There is nothing you can't do.

01:01:25.305 --> 01:01:26.774
This is your time.

01:01:28.207 --> 01:01:31.544
Once you've got kids, it's
a little bit different.

01:01:34.247 --> 01:01:35.415
Yeah.

01:01:39.952 --> 01:01:41.421
I'd better go.

01:01:42.222 --> 01:01:43.457
Hello?

01:01:45.225 --> 01:01:46.861
- How are you, honey?
- I'm fine, thank you.

01:01:48.327 --> 01:01:50.761
- I'll drop you home.
- Oh, no, you're all right.

01:01:50.763 --> 01:01:53.566
- It's fine. I'll just take the bus.
- No, come on.

01:01:58.872 --> 01:02:00.875
- Sleep well.
- Aye, yeah.

01:02:01.607 --> 01:02:02.910
See you in the morning.

01:02:16.256 --> 01:02:17.892
You homesick, aye?

01:02:37.142 --> 01:02:39.544
What, is this the one where you
try and stick it up the daily woman?

01:02:39.546 --> 01:02:40.848
No, no.

01:02:44.684 --> 01:02:47.588
This is the one where I
tell you that I'm on to you.

01:02:49.022 --> 01:02:50.591
I know you did the jail.

01:02:51.691 --> 01:02:53.359
And I know what you were in for.

01:02:58.798 --> 01:03:01.466
Susannah's bought into
whatever it is you're selling,

01:03:01.468 --> 01:03:04.205
and I'm not about to take
that away from her now.

01:03:05.705 --> 01:03:08.442
But I don't want you
anywhere near my kids, so...

01:03:09.609 --> 01:03:10.844
See the morrow?

01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:14.615
Sing your song, get your money,

01:03:15.347 --> 01:03:16.683
then you're gone.

01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:44.544
Lyle, hurry up.

01:03:46.078 --> 01:03:47.615
We haven't got all day.

01:03:49.649 --> 01:03:54.685
Rosie! Where you been, man?
Havenae seen hide nor hair of you.

01:03:56.555 --> 01:03:58.791
- All right, wee man?
- I'll be in in a minute.

01:04:08.334 --> 01:04:09.566
You all right, pal?

01:04:09.568 --> 01:04:11.537
Aye, you know, I'm brand-new.

01:04:18.111 --> 01:04:19.580
Lyle?

01:04:20.647 --> 01:04:22.412
His name's Lyle. He's five.

01:04:22.414 --> 01:04:24.549
He swung on a wardrobe and it fell on him.

01:04:24.551 --> 01:04:28.352
I think it's just his arms that he's
hurt, but maybe his head as well.

01:04:28.354 --> 01:04:30.721
Okay, Lyle, do you mind
if I have a wee look?

01:04:30.723 --> 01:04:34.361
- Ow!
- Shh, shh, shh...

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:36.894
- All right.
- She's gonna have a wee look, okay?

01:04:36.896 --> 01:04:40.064
- Any allergies?
- No, I don't... I don't think so, no.

01:04:40.066 --> 01:04:41.966
Fabric plasters.

01:04:41.968 --> 01:04:45.002
Okay, um, we'll need to X-ray him.

01:04:45.004 --> 01:04:46.671
It's one of those nights in here,

01:04:46.673 --> 01:04:48.676
so it might be a while
until a doctor sees yous.

01:04:49.008 --> 01:04:51.042
- Okay.
- I want my granny.

01:04:51.044 --> 01:04:54.145
- Shh, shh...
- Please! I want my granny!

01:04:54.147 --> 01:04:57.785
- Please! I want my granny!
- It's okay, it's okay.

01:05:29.915 --> 01:05:31.718
- Are you Lyle's mum?
- Aye, yeah.

01:05:32.084 --> 01:05:34.754
- Dr Yousaf. I'm sorry about the wait.
- No.

01:05:35.187 --> 01:05:37.790
The X-ray looks fairly
straightforward, but he'll need a cast.

01:05:38.591 --> 01:05:39.723
When can we go home?

01:05:39.725 --> 01:05:42.125
We can't get the cast on
until the swelling's come down,

01:05:42.127 --> 01:05:43.896
so we are looking at a couple more hours.

01:05:44.531 --> 01:05:46.433
I'm sorry it's been such a long night.

01:05:52.738 --> 01:05:54.574
Oh, fucking hell.

01:06:27.539 --> 01:06:29.742
- Where is he?
- He's still asleep.

01:06:38.818 --> 01:06:42.486
Right. I'll take this one home and
you can stay here with the wee fella.

01:06:42.488 --> 01:06:43.656
No.

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:48.828
No.

01:06:51.164 --> 01:06:52.800
What's for you will no' go by you.

01:06:54.334 --> 01:06:57.504
Maybe 20 year in the baker's is enough
for you, but it's not enough for me.

01:06:57.736 --> 01:06:59.539
Away and get me a wee cup of tea, darling.

01:07:01.807 --> 01:07:03.476
What's the matter with you?

01:07:06.111 --> 01:07:08.749
I just... I just need you to help.

01:07:09.682 --> 01:07:10.950
Help me.

01:07:11.551 --> 01:07:13.984
Help you? Help you do what?

01:07:13.986 --> 01:07:16.722
Leave him here while you go
to a party? Is that the plan?

01:07:17.723 --> 01:07:21.658
I don't know what this awf'y
toffy woman thinks you are,

01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:24.798
but she wouldnae give you a brass
farthing if she knew the truth.

01:07:29.269 --> 01:07:31.238
You havenae even told her, have you?

01:07:33.305 --> 01:07:37.043
She doesnae even have a
clue that you've got kids.

01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:43.217
If you're no' even prepared
to acknowledge their existence,

01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:45.519
there's no hope for you.

01:07:46.718 --> 01:07:48.955
And there's sure as hell none for them.

01:07:53.725 --> 01:07:56.028
Go. Go to Nashville.

01:07:56.595 --> 01:07:58.731
Do whatever it is you
wanna do. Come on, darling.

01:07:59.865 --> 01:08:01.601

Jesus Christ! I thought
you were a no-show.

01:09:54.113 --> 01:09:56.383
The band have had to talk me off a ledge.

01:09:56.915 --> 01:09:59.084
You look tired. Are you all right?

01:09:59.086 --> 01:10:01.288
Oh, yeah, aye. I'm... brand-new.

01:10:02.288 --> 01:10:03.853
- Oh, good, good.
- Great.

01:10:03.855 --> 01:10:07.157

Okay, um...

01:10:20.105 --> 01:10:24.709
so, not long ago, a spark of
light flew in through my door

01:10:24.711 --> 01:10:30.283
and reminded me of why I fell in
love with Glasgow in the first place.

01:10:32.150 --> 01:10:35.752
The girl, like the city, is gallus.

01:10:35.754 --> 01:10:36.953
Whoo!

01:10:36.955 --> 01:10:41.028
She's funny and, above all
else, she's completely fearless.

01:10:41.894 --> 01:10:44.161
And with your help,
she's going to Nashville

01:10:44.163 --> 01:10:46.900
to do what she was put on this earth to do.

01:10:48.266 --> 01:10:51.771
I'm so proud to know her
and call her my friend.

01:10:53.271 --> 01:10:58.242

hands together for Rose-Lynn Harlan!

01:11:13.292 --> 01:11:14.861
Okay? Let's go.

01:11:56.168 --> 01:11:58.234
Sor-sor-sorry. Can
you just give me...?

01:11:58.236 --> 01:12:00.140

01:12:11.417 --> 01:12:13.453

01:12:13.953 --> 01:12:15.219

Rose-Lynn, please.

01:12:20.293 --> 01:12:22.896
What's going on? What are you
doing? Where are you going?

01:12:26.598 --> 01:12:28.101
What's happened?

01:12:29.401 --> 01:12:32.068
Oh, darling. Come on.

01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:35.809
I don't know what... what you see
when you look at me, but it isnae me.

01:12:36.876 --> 01:12:39.309
- What are you talking about?
- I'm not at the height of my powers.

01:12:39.311 --> 01:12:42.314
I'm not free and there's
so, so much I can't undo.

01:12:43.516 --> 01:12:45.381
I can't undo going to the jail.

01:12:45.383 --> 01:12:47.518
I cannae undo chucking in heroin

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:50.520
to all they lasses in there
already fucked from drugs.

01:12:50.522 --> 01:12:52.492
And do you know what else I cannae undo?

01:12:53.191 --> 01:12:54.895
Having two kids.

01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:59.332
Two beautiful children before I was 18.

01:13:00.932 --> 01:13:02.535
Wynonna, she's eight,

01:13:03.336 --> 01:13:05.437
and Lyle, he's five, and I...

01:13:06.038 --> 01:13:09.843
I got 12 months in the jail
and I left behind two kids.

01:13:12.912 --> 01:13:15.478
Yeah, that's the truth.

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:17.050

- An island?

01:14:53.311 --> 01:14:56.382
- It's a clam.
- Do you think you can open it?

01:15:23.109 --> 01:15:24.410

01:15:34.119 --> 01:15:36.655

I wanted you to take responsibility,

01:18:15.814 --> 01:18:17.851
but I never meant to take away your hope.

01:18:20.919 --> 01:18:22.721
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:18:24.656 --> 01:18:27.925

01:18:37.336 --> 01:18:38.570
No.

01:18:39.805 --> 01:18:41.508
I cannae start all that up again.

01:18:43.475 --> 01:18:44.776
It's finished.

01:18:48.513 --> 01:18:50.415
I always said I'd go to college

01:18:50.748 --> 01:18:52.918
if I hadnae had to go to work at 15.

01:18:53.452 --> 01:18:54.654

01:19:01.961 --> 01:19:03.829
what was stopping me, you know?

01:19:05.797 --> 01:19:08.501
Even after I had you, I could have gone.

01:19:12.404 --> 01:19:14.507
But I think it was just easier for me to...

01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:16.776
to want things for you

01:19:17.275 --> 01:19:19.811

Welcome to the Ryman, the
mother church of country music.

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:19.603
This is the exact spot
where bluegrass was born

01:25:19.605 --> 01:25:22.208
and where Johnny Cash met June Carter.

01:25:22.708 --> 01:25:25.742
Now, it was right here that
country music found an audience

01:25:25.744 --> 01:25:27.277
beyond its own back porch

01:25:27.279 --> 01:25:29.749
and countless careers took off.

01:25:30.015 --> 01:25:34.084
Now, when the Grand Ole Opry
put down roots here in 1943,

01:25:34.086 --> 01:25:38.188
the live radio and TV show
brought the likes of Elvis Presley,

01:25:38.190 --> 01:25:41.057
Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Marty Robbins,

01:25:41.059 --> 01:25:43.993
Minnie Pearl, Patsy Cline, and Roy Acuff

01:25:43.995 --> 01:25:46.929
