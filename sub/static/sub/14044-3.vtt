WEBVTT

00:02.008 --> 00:05.000
It's impressive, Mal.
Even for you.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
You have lied by omission to Parliament
and to your own constituents.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.010
This is a "catastroFuck"
of your own making.

00:13.010 --> 00:14.060
The clock is ticking on my career.

00:14.060 --> 00:16.059
You expect something from me.

00:16.059 --> 00:18.010
And you should help me.

00:18.010 --> 00:22.050
An error on the part of an
over-zealous Beijing Police Officer.

00:22.050 --> 00:24.050
As Mr. Paxton has said.

00:24.050 --> 00:26.050
Where is Sabine Hobbs?

00:26.050 --> 00:28.050
Where is she?

00:29.044 --> 00:32.072
How long do we have to maintain this
illusion? She is blind, not stupid.

00:33.040 --> 00:37.072
Mr. Huxley, when was the last time
someone from the Consulate saw Sabine?

00:37.072 --> 00:41.012
Did Sabine have any
involvement with dissident groups?

00:43.010 --> 00:44.012
Hi.

00:44.012 --> 00:46.012
Ivy. Ivy Chen.

00:46.020 --> 00:48.012
How did you know Mr. Rankin?

00:48.052 --> 00:51.065
How do you explain the relationship
between you, Loyd Rankin and Ivy Chen?

00:51.065 --> 00:54.065
There are two numbers here. 
Were either of them retrieved?

00:54.065 --> 00:55.065
Not that I know of.

00:58.085 --> 01:01.035
I think one of you has picked up 
something that doesn't belong to you.

01:01.035 --> 01:02.035
Give me the SIM.

01:05.055 --> 01:08.035
The Dalgetty investigation 
has been shut down.

01:08.035 --> 01:11.035
- Any particular reason? 
- Inter-Agency matter.

01:13.005 --> 01:16.005
- I'm in trouble, Harry. 
- Kim, you're scaring me.

01:19.065 --> 01:22.084
[Crying]

01:24.000 --> 01:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:03.000 --> 02:04.043
You'll catch your death out here.

02:05.083 --> 02:07.043
Why did you bring me here?

02:08.013 --> 02:09.043
Don't come any closer.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.043
I'ts a bit melodramatic.

02:12.093 --> 02:15.043
Really? How did your mother die?

02:15.043 --> 02:17.000
You think I killed your mother?

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
She falls from the balcony
 of a 4th floor apartment.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.020
You get arrested on the same day.

02:22.060 --> 02:27.020
The only person who could make the link
between you and my mother, turns up dead.

02:27.040 --> 02:29.020
Look, I don't know what Loyd told you.

02:29.070 --> 02:32.020
No one killed your mother, Ivy.

02:32.020 --> 02:33.050
She was...

02:34.090 --> 02:36.050
 She was unhappy.

02:38.020 --> 02:40.070
But there are people here
who wanna do me harm.

02:41.040 --> 02:43.090
And I don't want you 
to get caught up in that.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
The Vienna Conservatory. 
Degree in Musicology.

02:49.080 --> 02:51.050
I'll... I'll cover your fees,

02:51.050 --> 02:53.038
- your board. 
- All blood money.

02:53.038 --> 02:54.053
Look, I'm trying to protect you.

02:54.053 --> 02:58.053
I don't want your help. 
I don't want anything more to do with you.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.053
Do not try to see me again.

03:00.055 --> 03:03.033
If you do, I will call the police.

03:03.033 --> 03:07.020
I will call the newspapers. Maybe this 
time you will actually get charged.

03:07.021 --> 03:09.055
- Just stop it, Ivy. 
- Don't! Just... [Scream]

03:10.000 --> 03:11.098
- Okay... 
- Get away from me!

03:11.098 --> 03:14.000
- Calm down, okay? 
- Is everything alright?

04:32.020 --> 04:33.050
Name?

04:33.060 --> 04:36.000
Phone, camera, recording device.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.020
Putting it down, as well.

04:37.050 --> 04:39.020
- Hetty?

04:40.050 --> 04:42.040
- Aw, Les.

04:43.020 --> 04:45.020
- How are you?

04:48.050 --> 04:52.020
- It's like we lost him twice.

04:54.020 --> 04:56.036
Bloody Fort Knox.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
 I wanted him burried on 
the farm, did you know?

05:00.060 --> 05:02.000
They won't allow it.

05:02.040 --> 05:05.010
Yeah. The Director likes to be in control.

05:11.010 --> 05:13.032
- It's so fuckin' hot in here!

05:14.022 --> 05:16.024
Turn it down, somebody is gonna collapse.

05:16.024 --> 05:18.030
- Sorry, Sir, but... 
- What?!

05:18.030 --> 05:21.030
You're gonna run a fuckin' war 
but you can't operate a heater?

05:21.030 --> 05:22.068
The heating is not on, Sir.

05:44.000 --> 05:51.040
I know we're all shocked and saddened 
by the sudden loss of our colleague.

05:51.090 --> 05:53.040
And friend.

05:54.000 --> 06:00.050
Before we begin, however, I'd like to remind 
you all of the need to be circumspect

06:00.050 --> 06:07.050
when a tragic personal event
invites the curiosity of outsiders.

06:10.044 --> 06:12.080
Benjamin Lesley Gordon

06:13.092 --> 06:17.072
 joined what was then 
the Defense Signals Directorate

06:17.072 --> 06:20.032
in the intake of 2001,

06:21.000 --> 06:27.036
after a brilliant academic career
at the Australian National University.

06:27.036 --> 06:33.032
That brilliance continued in the work
that he did at the Directorate.

06:33.032 --> 06:38.096
From his arrival in 2001, 
until his passing last week.

07:02.090 --> 07:14.000
[Singing]

07:14.000 --> 07:15.048
Senator Paxton?

07:17.040 --> 07:18.050
Mrs. Hobbs...

07:19.040 --> 07:20.080
No one is telling me anything.

07:21.030 --> 07:24.052
All I get from the 
Consulate are empty assurances.

07:24.052 --> 07:26.048
- What's the Government doing? 
- Mrs. Hobbs,

07:26.048 --> 07:29.076
-  I can fully appreciate your concern... 
- I do not know where Sabine is.

07:29.076 --> 07:31.076
- Or how she is, or even if...

07:32.020 --> 07:35.070
- I, I just wanna hear her voice. 
- Look, I can only...

07:35.070 --> 07:38.092
- reiterate the Government's assurances... 
- Bullshit!

07:38.092 --> 07:42.038
Your Government is doing everything
it can to aggravate China.

07:42.038 --> 07:44.042
Moving warships into 
the South China Sea.

07:44.042 --> 07:47.065
How do you think warmongering is going
to help Sabine? You're making things worse!

07:47.065 --> 07:51.010
- Okay, I can't continue this conversation... 
- I want to speak to my daughter.

07:51.010 --> 07:53.048
- Yes, I appreciate that... 
- I want to know if she is alright.

07:53.048 --> 07:54.064
- Yes.

07:54.064 --> 07:56.064
 - I... I want to know if she is alive.

08:03.060 --> 08:04.080
Cancel my meetings.

08:05.044 --> 08:11.024
That oxidized tin soldier, McAuliffe, is wandering
 around Parliament, trying to wrangle a war.

08:11.024 --> 08:13.060
Just the South China Sea or 
is he thinking of expanding?

08:13.060 --> 08:14.048
- Who knows?

08:14.050 --> 08:16.048
But I'm gonna find out.

08:17.050 --> 08:19.070
- I've got a friend in Catering, who'll know.

08:20.060 --> 08:22.068
- Hi, Barbara, it's Ronnie.

08:22.068 --> 08:26.050
Look, have you had any orders 
in the past 15, 20 minutes?

08:28.060 --> 08:30.020
- Thank you.

08:31.070 --> 08:33.075
- Heavy frost this morning, General.

08:33.075 --> 08:36.080
- Well, we'll see worse before Winter is over.

08:37.070 --> 08:39.000
[Muffled] - Thank you, Melanie.

08:47.083 --> 08:51.000
- Good morning, General. 
Room for one more?

08:51.030 --> 08:53.000
- Plenty of room, Mal.

08:53.070 --> 08:56.024
Cups are on the sideboard. 
Help yourself.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.092
So which of my warships are you
two planning to send out next?

09:00.092 --> 09:06.010
- The General is here to discuss
National Security Legislation.

09:11.056 --> 09:14.010
- Safer Australia Agency.

09:14.010 --> 09:17.070
I see you haven't lost your yearn 
for the Orwellian, Catriona.

09:17.070 --> 09:19.040
It's a dangerous world, Mal.

09:19.040 --> 09:22.080
We can't take a *** 
approach to intelligence.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.080
- So you want a centralized Agency
that will collect, pretty much,

09:27.080 --> 09:32.000
all the electronic communications through 
Australia, Asia and the Middle East,

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
linked to the Five Eyes 
military satellites.

09:34.030 --> 09:36.096
- Hum, we're gathering 
the Intelligence, anyway.

09:36.096 --> 09:40.036
Only now you get to to cross-reference
Auntie Margaret's Christmas calls,

09:40.036 --> 09:42.036
with vision from an armed drone.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.068
Do, do I need a warrant for any of this?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.068
No. Just authorization from the Minister,

09:50.068 --> 09:52.068
that happens to be you, Catriona.

09:54.064 --> 09:56.040
This is a bill for a Police State.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.010
With you as the big fat
spider in the center of it.

10:03.050 --> 10:05.012
This thing will never get through Cabinet.

10:05.093 --> 10:08.085
There are still a few surviving 
civilibitarians in the building

10:08.085 --> 10:10.044
and Martin Toohey is one of them.

10:11.020 --> 10:13.015
That thing has got two chances:

10:13.015 --> 10:15.015
fuck all and none.

10:21.050 --> 10:22.080
Mal!

10:22.080 --> 10:24.035
Don't waste your breath, Catriona.

10:24.035 --> 10:25.060
Mal!

10:26.060 --> 10:28.040
You're wounded, Mal.

10:28.040 --> 10:31.020
Trailing blood all over camper.

10:31.020 --> 10:33.020
Your supporters have turned their backs.

10:33.020 --> 10:34.080
Toohey wants nothing to do with you.

10:34.080 --> 10:36.080
I may be the only friend you have left!

10:37.046 --> 10:38.080
Well, than I'm in trouble.

10:39.080 --> 10:41.052
I'm concerned.

10:42.012 --> 10:44.040
A Minister of the Crown,
 implicated in a crime

10:44.040 --> 10:46.040
 and yet no investigation.

10:46.040 --> 10:49.000
I wonder if ASIO or 
the Federal Police

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
 might wanna look 
a little more closely.

10:51.056 --> 10:53.000
Dig around a little bit.

10:53.076 --> 10:56.048
Find something... fresh.

10:57.020 --> 10:58.008
Hum?

11:02.015 --> 11:03.020
Fuck you.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.070
Eloquent as ever.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.070
Shifty hard-ass caprine bureaucrats.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.040
I want to know the truth, Het.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.020
I'm not gonna get it from them.

11:22.080 --> 11:25.040
But I am gonna find out what happened.

11:26.040 --> 11:29.040
Nothing stays hidden in 
this town for long, Les.

11:29.040 --> 11:31.040
Oh, I don't know.

11:31.040 --> 11:34.044
Ben was pretty good 
at keeping his secret.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.092
And it was easier for me 
to understand Ben...

11:40.000 --> 11:42.004
becoming a woman.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.050
But to understand him leaving you?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.050
Come one, we'll get 
you another cup of tea.

11:53.050 --> 11:54.040
No.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.030
It's a long drive home and 
the bladder isn't what it was.

12:02.060 --> 12:04.096
You'll always be 
welcome at the farm, Het.

12:04.096 --> 12:06.096
You're done with that, aren't you?

12:12.080 --> 12:13.091
I'll talk to you soon.

12:16.050 --> 12:18.000
I'm sorry for your loss.

12:19.050 --> 12:20.060
And yours.

12:29.060 --> 12:32.070
Oh well, I'm needed 
right back at the office.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.050
- Hey, Thomas. 
- Yeah?

12:35.000 --> 12:37.050
Have you been questioned 
by the police yet?

12:38.080 --> 12:40.040
Has anyone from the Directorate?

12:40.040 --> 12:42.076
 Because I've already 
been called in 3 times.

12:43.020 --> 12:49.070
Hum... We... Oh! I really, really
 need to get a half-day, so...

12:49.070 --> 12:51.070
Thomas, everyhting here,

12:51.070 --> 12:53.070
points to an agency covering-up.

12:56.080 --> 12:57.030
Hum...

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
I don't know anything.

13:01.050 --> 13:02.050
Goodbye, Harriet.

13:24.080 --> 13:27.030
You are toxic, Mal. 
Stay the fuck away!

13:27.030 --> 13:28.080
I wanna see him.

13:28.080 --> 13:31.000
- My advice to you is 
to keep your head down,

13:31.000 --> 13:34.020
- Save me...  
- ...until everyone has forgotten about this Chinese debacle.

13:34.020 --> 13:35.004
Are you finished?

13:35.004 --> 13:38.084
I will not cop a lecture from you
 while he hides there in his office.

13:38.084 --> 13:40.084
- Come on, mate! 
- Don't call me mate!

13:41.060 --> 13:44.020
Mate is a term that is earned.

13:44.070 --> 13:45.080
Isn't it, Marty?

13:45.080 --> 13:48.050
It is earned over years 
of watching someone's back,

13:48.050 --> 13:50.010
 rounding up someone's supporters

13:50.010 --> 13:51.060
and knifing their enemies.

13:51.060 --> 13:55.030
And doing favors that even his 
Chief of Staff has no idea about.

13:55.030 --> 13:56.050
In here.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.050
Not you.

14:04.020 --> 14:07.024
Catriona Bailey is... 
out of control.

14:07.024 --> 14:09.050
She is trying to turn this
 country into a dictatorship,

14:09.050 --> 14:11.072
with herself as Chief of the Stasi.

14:12.012 --> 14:13.072
- You've seen the bill.

14:13.072 --> 14:15.010
It's the old one-two combination.

14:15.010 --> 14:19.000
Start a war and while everyone is 
shit-scared about the foreign hordes,

14:19.000 --> 14:20.055
you relieve them of their civil rights.

14:20.055 --> 14:22.070
Catriona Bailey has not started a war.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.070
But she is part of the escalation!

14:24.070 --> 14:26.070
Reaction and overreaction.

14:26.070 --> 14:29.065
Until we're sandwiched between 
two heavily armed super powers.

14:29.065 --> 14:31.065
Neither of whom will back down.

14:31.065 --> 14:33.065
Bailey is in my good books.

14:34.020 --> 14:36.045
She didn't publicly humiliate me.

14:37.015 --> 14:39.090
Look, I think I can 
arrange a prisoner's swap.

14:39.090 --> 14:41.090
And we can get Sabine Hobbs home.

14:41.090 --> 14:45.060
Mal, if I hear the words 'Paxton' 
and 'China' on the same day,

14:45.060 --> 14:48.040
if you so much as drink 
a cup of Chinese tea,

14:48.040 --> 14:50.040
I will sack you from the Cabinet.

14:50.040 --> 14:53.035
And then I will make 
sure you lose pre-selection.

14:54.010 --> 14:56.065
Bailey supports you when it 
serves her best interests.

14:57.056 --> 14:59.092
The minute that changes, 
she will roll right over you.

14:59.092 --> 15:01.092
And I'm prepared for that.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.050
Did you prefer coffee?

15:34.050 --> 15:36.050
Sorry about that. 
I'll clean that up.

15:36.050 --> 15:38.050
Just give me a moment.
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,020
Hello?

16:19.050 --> 16:20.050
Hello?

16:34.010 --> 16:35.050
Do you have a warrant?

16:38.000 --> 16:39.010
He was a friend.

16:39.050 --> 16:41.025
A friend with a house key?

16:43.010 --> 16:48.012
So, Charles Dancer. Kim and I 
were colleagues. Across Agencies.

16:48.060 --> 16:50.012
ASIO?

16:50.090 --> 16:53.040
It doesn't show...

16:54.040 --> 16:56.030
She never mentioned you.

16:56.030 --> 16:58.030
- I never mentioned her.

16:58.030 --> 17:00.030
The Agencies have 
rules, as you know.

17:00.030 --> 17:02.030
Were you two involved?

17:04.020 --> 17:05.060
Can I get you a Vodka?

17:09.079 --> 17:12.030
You know, fucking her doesn't 
give you the right to help yourself.

17:13.030 --> 17:14.030
I brought it with me.

17:15.050 --> 17:17.079
Well, I would prefer that 
you didn't drink it here.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.045
You're gonna leave the key.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.020
Is ASIO investigating?

17:43.000 --> 17:45.030
As far as I'm aware, 
it's a Police matter.

17:45.030 --> 17:47.030
Even the Police don't have a clue.

17:47.030 --> 17:49.030
They probably think it was me.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.000
Well, then...

17:56.090 --> 17:59.060
You might find yourself 
in need of a friend.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.000
You were right.

19:18.070 --> 19:21.000
You were right about a lot of things.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.030
Harry, listen...

19:33.030 --> 19:35.030
Remember the shared house?

19:36.020 --> 19:37.050
You were right.

19:38.030 --> 19:39.050
You were right about a lot of things.

21:05.050 --> 21:07.020
We have to avoid conflict.

21:07.020 --> 21:08.030
That's not on my agenda.

21:08.030 --> 21:11.040
But nobody is thinking rationally, 
with Sabine Hobbs in jail.

21:12.010 --> 21:15.020
You must be able to arrange some 
sort of prisoners' swap, surely.

21:15.080 --> 21:17.020
I didn't come here to be lobbied.

21:17.020 --> 21:19.020
Make an appointment with my office.

21:19.020 --> 21:20.025
Stay.

21:23.020 --> 21:25.040
What does Beijing want 
in return for Sabine?

21:25.040 --> 21:28.035
- Whatever it is, I'm sure that my office... 
- Whatever it is, you can't give.

21:28.035 --> 21:30.020
And don't pretend you care about her.

21:30.020 --> 21:32.000
This is about your job.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
If Australia ends up in conflict

21:34.000 --> 21:35.040
you won't last long.

21:35.040 --> 21:37.040
Just let Sabine talk to her mother.

21:37.080 --> 21:39.040
And then?

21:40.000 --> 21:41.040
What will you want next?

21:42.030 --> 21:44.050
Tell me we both want the same thing.

organize your protest.

No.

I can't.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.060
I understand.

23:35.050 --> 23:37.020
But I need your help.

23:39.050 --> 23:43.050
And your mother. 
She must be so sad.

23:55.050 --> 23:59.040
Kim left it for me. It's some sort of 
message but I just can't work it out.

It's heavily encrypted.

Okay, here we go. 
I've got something.

I can tell you when 
the file was uploaded.

24:20.050 --> 24:24.000
Ok, well, I can tell you that. It was 
last Thursday. The day that Kim died.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
No. It was before that.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
Two weeks ago. July the 23rd.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.020
July the 23rd?

Is that important?

in the Choir with Sabine. Kevin?

Yeah. Kevin Dang.

Can I speak to him?

 across Campus with his girlfriend.

Cassie, did you and Kevin 
know the boy from the lake?

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
- Max Dalgety. 
- Yeah.

25:25.070 --> 25:28.010
Max was like Kevin's twin brother.

25:28.010 --> 25:30.010
They spoke there in secret geek speak.

25:32.050 --> 25:34.040
Max studied Computer Science?

25:34.040 --> 25:36.020
I guess so.

25:36.020 --> 25:40.070
They'd go into the room for days. Living off 
nothing but packet noodles and cider.

25:40.070 --> 25:42.070
Okay. Do you know what they were doing?

25:42.090 --> 25:46.000
No way. It was like 
a kosher kitchen.

25:46.080 --> 25:49.085
Kevin uses my laptop 
and Wi-Fi for UNI work,

25:49.085 --> 25:52.085
and anything personal. I can check
 his e-mails and open Facebook,

25:52.085 --> 25:55.080
but anything to do 
with Max, strictly quarantined.

25:55.080 --> 25:57.080
So, what do you think they were doing?

25:58.090 --> 26:00.050

I wouldn't have 
gotten answered, anyway.

was something Darknet.

 a hotel or a near B&B, under their name?

- Meet me in New Acton?

35:48.000 --> 35:49.010
- Hey.

35:49.010 --> 35:51.040
- I think the meeting 
place is a coded message.

35:51.040 --> 35:52.030
- Café Mocean?

35:52.050 --> 35:54.030
Kevin hates cafés.

35:54.090 --> 35:57.050
- He can't stand the smell of coffee. 
He can't stand the taste.

35:57.050 --> 36:00.060
I think it's his way of telling me 
that something is not right.

36:02.090 --> 36:04.050
- He may be watched.

36:04.050 --> 36:07.010
When Kevin approaches, call me.

36:07.010 --> 36:09.000
And then put your phone on speaker,

36:09.000 --> 36:10.070
and I'll record the conversation.

36:10.070 --> 36:11.070
What should I ask him?

36:11.090 --> 36:13.070
Just keep him talking.

36:13.070 --> 36:15.070
Sho... Should I mention Max?

36:15.070 --> 36:18.050
No. No. Definitely not.

36:19.080 --> 36:20.050
- It's okay.

36:25.050 --> 36:26.030

- You're okay?

37:02.080 --> 37:05.070
- Australia is not 
working out for me.

37:05.070 --> 37:07.070
It's time to go home.

37:09.090 --> 37:10.070
Home?

37:11.040 --> 37:12.070
- What about UNI?

37:13.050 --> 37:16.040
It's better I finish
 my studies in China.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.040
- But what about me?

37:21.040 --> 37:23.050
I miss home.

37:24.050 --> 37:26.060
The are many opportunities there.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.070
You miss your family?

37:33.050 --> 37:35.020
You wanna take care of them?

37:35.090 --> 37:37.020
Yes.

- Hum... Double shot macchiato.

37:45.040 --> 37:46.070
- Okay. No worries.

39:03.040 --> 39:06.010
- No problem. 
I'll talk to you soon.

39:31.020 --> 39:34.080
That's the information you 
requested on Bailey and McAuliffe.

39:34.080 --> 39:39.030
It's mostly Cabinet briefings, estimates
 and prepared answers for question time.

39:39.030 --> 39:40.060
So this is not all of it.

39:40.060 --> 39:43.020

- Geez, what happened to your face, mate? 
- Dyl!

39:53.020 --> 39:54.090
Tried to get myself a piercing.

39:54.090 --> 39:57.080

 in the head looks like, mate.

39:57.080 --> 39:59.040
- Are you talking to your father, Dylan?

39:59.040 --> 40:00.080
- I'm talking to him now!

40:00.080 --> 40:02.030
What's this "Cerberus"?

40:02.030 --> 40:06.010
- Every Friday, the ComCar drivers 
take some pro-American wankers

40:06.010 --> 40:08.087
to the Commonwealth Club for lunch
 with their American counterparts.

40:08.087 --> 40:10.020
And they call it "Cerberus"?

40:10.020 --> 40:12.090
- Cerberus is the three-headed
 dog of Greek Mythology.

40:12.090 --> 40:14.010
It guards the gates of hell.

40:14.010 --> 40:17.060
Well, there you go. 
Who punched you, Dylan?

40:17.060 --> 40:19.090
Was it one of those pricks from 
that toff-y school of yours?

40:19.090 --> 40:22.090

tell her I spoke to you.

the PM is going to Japan?

41:08.095 --> 41:10.065
- He'll know soon enough.

41:10.065 --> 41:12.065
Well, he is a dead 
man walking, anyway.

will or won't survive.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.040

41:39.090 --> 41:42.050
One of them has crashed 
into a Chinese patrol boat.

41:42.050 --> 41:43.050
Which one?!

41:43.050 --> 41:46.030
An escort vessel for 
the HMAS Anzac, I believe.

41:46.030 --> 41:49.070
One of the Chinese sailors 
has gone overboard. He's drowned.

41:49.070 --> 41:51.000
Jesus!

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
