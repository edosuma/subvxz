00:27.110 --> 00:29.863
I love this job!
Can't you go faster?

00:30.070 --> 00:31.947
- Floor this thing!
- It's my wife's.

00:32.150 --> 00:34.789
- I won't go faster.
- You're doing 65 now.

00:34.990 --> 00:36.469
65?! Shit!

00:36.710 --> 00:39.349
Get your foot off the pedal!
You're killing my corn!

00:41.950 --> 00:45.101
We're eastbound on Fourth,
in pursuit of a red BMW...

00:45.310 --> 00:46.823
...driver Caucasian, blond.

00:47.030 --> 00:49.225
Plate "2-Boy-Adam-Henry-174."

00:51.070 --> 00:54.221
<i>You are westbound on Second.
20-William- 12 is southbound...</i>

00:54.430 --> 00:57.786
...approaching Second.
You're heading right for each other.

00:57.990 --> 00:59.821
<i>- Somebody back off.
- Got it!</i>

01:00.030 --> 01:02.544
- What'd she say?
- We're about to have an accident.

01:03.510 --> 01:06.422
- You're gonna get us killed!
- Shit! I'm...

01:20.990 --> 01:24.778
We'll stick with this red
son of a bitch. You chase the blue.

01:25.030 --> 01:28.466
20-William-15, that's confirmed.
You got red, we'll get blue.

01:28.710 --> 01:32.828
- What's the pursuit?
- 20-William-15 and 20-William-12.

01:33.270 --> 01:35.022
- Riggs, Murtaugh.
- And the squad.

01:35.230 --> 01:37.698
- $ 20 on Riggs and Murtaugh.
- Who's driving?

01:37.910 --> 01:39.468
Murtaugh, in his wife's wagon.

01:39.710 --> 01:42.702
I knew nothing about the wife's
station wagon. Bet's off!

01:42.910 --> 01:43.899
Shut up!

01:52.950 --> 01:54.224
What the hell is that?

01:54.430 --> 01:56.785
What fucking language is that?

01:56.990 --> 01:58.105
It's German.

01:58.630 --> 01:59.540
Japanese?

01:59.750 --> 02:02.583
It's a Japanese radio.
Maybe they bought the LAPD.

02:02.790 --> 02:03.779
They own everything.

02:09.310 --> 02:10.628
Shotgun!

02:19.230 --> 02:20.868
Shots are being fired.

02:21.510 --> 02:23.068
Thanks for the scoop.

02:23.390 --> 02:25.950
The son of a bitch shot
my wife's windshield.

02:26.150 --> 02:27.344
Entering the pursuit.

02:40.230 --> 02:42.824
Shit, man!
We're splitting up!

02:47.070 --> 02:49.186
Son of a bitch!
Now we're cooking!

02:53.150 --> 02:53.946
Step on it!

03:06.590 --> 03:07.545
Look out!

03:14.390 --> 03:15.505
See you!

03:35.870 --> 03:38.543
I'd like to see your license
and proof of insurance!

03:53.630 --> 03:55.985
We got one.
Yours is going up the hill.

03:56.190 --> 03:57.418
<i>So is Riggs, on foot!</i>

04:01.110 --> 04:04.147
Hey, Riggs!
Get your slow ass in here!

04:04.350 --> 04:05.988
Get in here. Now!

04:06.310 --> 04:07.265
Only if I drive.

04:07.470 --> 04:09.062
Move over, I'll drive.

04:09.270 --> 04:11.545
No, go around. I'm driving.

04:11.830 --> 04:13.149
I'll drive.

04:14.790 --> 04:17.144
Did you get a make
on that red Beemer yet?

04:17.430 --> 04:18.783
Not a scratch, you hear?

04:23.870 --> 04:25.303
You're not gonna make it.

04:25.590 --> 04:26.864
There's no room!

04:27.070 --> 04:28.549
You're not gonna make it!

04:29.630 --> 04:32.019
Look at my side panel!

04:41.590 --> 04:43.979
Goddamn it, you were right, you know.

04:44.310 --> 04:46.301
There wasn't enough room.

05:01.470 --> 05:03.745
Get down! Get down!

05:05.310 --> 05:07.187
Get down, stay down!

05:46.230 --> 05:47.583
He's making a hard right.

05:56.630 --> 05:58.382
Get out of the way!

06:12.630 --> 06:14.109
This was a new car, Riggs.

06:14.550 --> 06:15.539
It still is.

06:22.910 --> 06:24.025
On three.

06:24.710 --> 06:25.620
One...

06:26.230 --> 06:28.061
...two... three!

06:29.470 --> 06:30.585
Shit!

06:32.230 --> 06:34.300
You forgot your left indicator.

06:34.510 --> 06:36.819
Where the hell is he?
This guy's Mandrake!

06:37.030 --> 06:39.863
Where were you, man?!
Goddamn it!

06:40.110 --> 06:41.463
Me?! Where'd he go?!

06:41.710 --> 06:44.224
- He's fucking gone!
- I can see that!

06:44.510 --> 06:47.308
- You come on "three"!
- It's "three," then go!

06:47.550 --> 06:49.222
No! We always go on "three"!

06:49.470 --> 06:53.145
Sometimes we go,
"one, two, three," then go!

06:53.590 --> 06:55.740
Go check back there!

06:59.870 --> 07:00.985
What was that?

07:03.070 --> 07:05.265
- He's in the trunk.
- I got you covered.

07:11.750 --> 07:13.263
Holy Christ!

07:13.950 --> 07:15.781
That's a lot of money.

07:19.270 --> 07:20.749
What is this?

07:21.590 --> 07:23.148
It's gold!

07:23.550 --> 07:24.824
Fucking gold!

07:25.030 --> 07:26.099
Krugerrands.

07:26.310 --> 07:29.143
It's illegal. You can't
import this into the country.

07:29.430 --> 07:30.306
You're right.

07:30.750 --> 07:34.106
The damage you caused comes
out of the department's budget.

07:34.310 --> 07:38.064
- Pay it off in Krugerrands.
- Don't make jokes, make arrests.

07:38.270 --> 07:40.306
You came up empty,
I want an explanation.

07:40.510 --> 07:44.105
- Things got out of hand.
- You said it was a routine bust.

07:44.350 --> 07:49.026
You didn't mention helicopters,
automatic weapons, Krugerrands...

07:49.430 --> 07:51.500
This was bigger than we thought.

07:51.750 --> 07:53.103
Talk to you later.

07:59.270 --> 08:03.104
I worked psycho ward, Riggs.
You'll never get out.

08:03.510 --> 08:05.785
One minute, 15 seconds.

08:06.030 --> 08:07.907
Shapiro, scratch my nose.

08:09.230 --> 08:13.587
What's going on here? Is this a
kindergarten class or a police station?

08:13.910 --> 08:15.548
Let's get some work done.

08:16.030 --> 08:18.544
Houdini Jr. Bets he can
free himself in five minutes.

08:18.790 --> 08:19.700
I will too.

08:24.750 --> 08:26.741
Don't try this at home, kids.

08:36.230 --> 08:37.504
It's all over now.

08:37.870 --> 08:40.861
Put your money on the table,
and get back to work.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.063
Suckers!

08:48.070 --> 08:49.901
Somebody check that thing, man.

08:50.110 --> 08:52.465
How the hell did you do that?

08:53.790 --> 08:57.260
I dislocated my shoulder once.
I can do it whenever I want to now.

08:57.470 --> 08:58.949
Goddamn, doesn't that hurt?

08:59.230 --> 09:01.061
Yeah, it does.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.308
But not as much as...

09:03.510 --> 09:05.182
...when I put it back in.

09:15.350 --> 09:17.181
If it isn't Mrs. Sigmund Fraud.

09:17.750 --> 09:20.264
My door is always open, sergeant.

09:20.950 --> 09:24.625
I think we ought to keep this
on a professional level, don't you?

09:25.510 --> 09:28.229
Why the hell do you
do this to yourself?

09:28.510 --> 09:31.263
Who else could I do it to?
None of them will let me.

09:31.550 --> 09:32.949
And I need the money.

09:33.150 --> 09:33.946
Cough up!

09:36.590 --> 09:39.309
It's not all here yet.
I want it all. I want the lot.

09:46.150 --> 09:47.981
Where did this come from?

09:48.830 --> 09:50.900
You can't help yourself to this stuff.

09:51.110 --> 09:53.465
This is evidence. It's a Krugerrand.

09:53.950 --> 09:56.464
- That's mine. I won that.
- It's not yours.

09:56.710 --> 09:58.985
You want to get busted?

10:00.070 --> 10:01.981
Want to get something to eat?

10:02.190 --> 10:05.102
Not tonight.
Rianne's commercial is on.

10:05.310 --> 10:08.029
- Rianne's in a commercial?
- Not so loud!

10:08.230 --> 10:10.949
What's the matter?
I'd be proud of her if I was you.

10:11.750 --> 10:15.106
I haven't seen it yet. I don't know.
What if she stinks?

10:15.310 --> 10:17.187
You gotta be kidding.
She'll be great!

10:17.390 --> 10:18.743
Everybody, listen up!

10:19.870 --> 10:21.826
Tonight at...
What time?

10:22.150 --> 10:22.980
Come on!

10:23.270 --> 10:24.703
What time?

10:25.270 --> 10:26.146
8:00.

10:26.350 --> 10:28.068
At 8:00 on channel...?

10:30.390 --> 10:33.302
Eight. The sergeant's
beautiful daughter Rianne...

10:33.510 --> 10:35.148
Here's her picture.

10:35.990 --> 10:39.346
She'll make her television debut
in a commercial.

10:45.510 --> 10:48.343
With this crowd, baby,
you'd better not stink.

11:01.150 --> 11:04.859
- Thought I'd get a new windshield.
- Don't worry, it'll be fine.

11:05.070 --> 11:07.265
- The hood.
- We got a new hood on order.

11:07.470 --> 11:09.506
- No bumper.
- We got a bumper on order.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.587
See you back at your place, Rog.

11:11.830 --> 11:15.027
- Lf you ever get there.
- Thanks. Thanks a lot.

11:15.230 --> 11:17.790
Be careful.
The mirror's got tape around it.

11:17.990 --> 11:20.220
Oh, boy. Shit.

11:32.870 --> 11:36.146
What happened? This was a new car.
Mom's gonna be upset!

11:36.350 --> 11:39.023
- It's still new.
- It's not! It's wrecked!

11:39.230 --> 11:41.585
I don't want your mother to know
about it.

11:42.790 --> 11:44.303
Do your homework too.

11:44.510 --> 11:47.343
- Hey! I haven't read these.
- Rianne put them there.

11:47.550 --> 11:49.905
Why don't you look out for me?

11:50.110 --> 11:54.228
Hey, Ricky! I want to use
my driveway once in a while.

11:54.510 --> 11:56.262
Nice o xygen tent.

11:56.470 --> 11:59.826
- Do I look like Michael Jackson?
- No, but you're bad.

12:00.190 --> 12:04.229
This is a two-car garage, and this is
my hobby room upstairs. Take a look.

12:04.430 --> 12:08.139
I retire when I'm 52, and the whole
nine yards kick in when I'm 55.

12:08.350 --> 12:10.818
Cut it out.
You're not retiring, are you?

12:11.030 --> 12:13.783
- I've thought of it since I met you.
- Thank you.

12:14.150 --> 12:17.426
This is a nice hobby room.
All you need now is a hobby.

12:20.350 --> 12:21.146
Jesus Christ!

12:21.590 --> 12:23.342
What's wrong with you guys?

12:23.550 --> 12:25.586
I'm sorry. That's very uncool.

12:25.830 --> 12:28.583
You're sorry?
Check my shorts, for chrissakes!

12:28.830 --> 12:31.469
- Don't you use hammers anymore?
- What's a hammer?

12:31.910 --> 12:33.263
Easy, easy.

12:33.470 --> 12:36.746
It's no Saturday night special,
for crying out loud.

12:38.030 --> 12:39.748
All right, give it back.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.307
A man's not safe in his own home.

12:43.510 --> 12:45.341
Stay the hell out of here, then.

12:45.950 --> 12:47.542
You got any traffic warrants?

12:47.750 --> 12:48.978
Why? Can you fix them?

12:55.950 --> 12:58.100
Almost time.
Are we taping this?

12:58.350 --> 13:01.148
Yes, so we can watch it
over and over again.

13:01.350 --> 13:02.578
Take the stairs.

13:02.830 --> 13:05.902
Nick, get your feet off the table.
You too, Martin.

13:06.110 --> 13:08.943
- The color's no good.
- It's fine. You'll mess it up.

13:09.150 --> 13:10.742
I want my baby to look good.

13:10.950 --> 13:11.700
Unplug it.

13:11.910 --> 13:13.104
That's your sister!

13:13.310 --> 13:14.459
Picture's perfect.

13:14.870 --> 13:16.019
You think so?

13:17.070 --> 13:18.219
Do I know you?

13:18.430 --> 13:19.260
Yes, sir.

13:19.470 --> 13:22.109
We had a long talk about a week ago.
Remember?

13:22.310 --> 13:23.709
We did? About what?

13:23.910 --> 13:26.822
- About your new hobby room.
- This is George!

13:28.870 --> 13:31.509
- How you doing?
- Did you sense that I liked you?

13:32.710 --> 13:33.699
Yes, sir.

13:34.630 --> 13:36.541
Then sit down and be quiet.

13:39.550 --> 13:42.462
- What's that you're eating?
- My tuna fish sandwich.

13:42.710 --> 13:43.620
Tuna?!

13:44.310 --> 13:46.221
Daddy, you can't eat tuna.

13:46.430 --> 13:47.829
Dad killed Flipper.

13:48.030 --> 13:49.668
We're boycotting tuna.

13:49.870 --> 13:53.579
They kill the dolphins that get caught
in the nets. Only albacore.

13:54.270 --> 13:55.225
Have ham.

13:55.550 --> 13:56.744
Eat Miss Piggy.

13:57.990 --> 14:00.026
- I'm sorry!
- It's only my eye.

14:04.870 --> 14:06.622
Oh, my God! It's coming on!

14:09.470 --> 14:10.619
My baby!

14:11.750 --> 14:13.820
Don't she look gorgeous, Martin?

14:22.590 --> 14:24.342
<i>When the time has come...</i>

14:24.910 --> 14:27.026
<i>... and the moment is right...</i>

14:27.870 --> 14:29.144
<i>... remember...</i>

14:29.470 --> 14:31.938
<i>... use Ramses Extra Condoms.</i>

14:32.670 --> 14:33.546
<i>We do!</i>

14:33.750 --> 14:35.342
<i>Ramses Extra.</i>

14:35.550 --> 14:38.747
<i>Because caring means
all the protection you can get.</i>

14:47.710 --> 14:49.780
Take the kids upstairs.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.742
We learn this in human development.

14:51.950 --> 14:54.305
In human what?!
Human development what?!

14:54.510 --> 14:56.102
Development. Chill out.

14:56.350 --> 14:57.465
Upstairs.

14:57.710 --> 14:59.143
Nick, upstairs.

14:59.710 --> 15:01.746
You know how your father is.

15:02.030 --> 15:04.385
- I looked fat.
- I liked you.

15:06.550 --> 15:07.869
Home. Out.

15:08.750 --> 15:09.705
George, I got a gun.

15:14.950 --> 15:17.100
What's with you?
She looked beautiful.

15:17.310 --> 15:20.859
I liked it. She made me want
to buy rubbers right now.

15:27.550 --> 15:30.508
I thought it was great.
Rianne, that was just...

15:31.350 --> 15:33.705
- I thought you were terrific.
- Really?

15:33.910 --> 15:35.741
I think she's got a future.
Don't you?

15:35.950 --> 15:38.510
- Yeah, she was good.
- George is afraid of Daddy.

15:38.790 --> 15:39.859
Stick around.

15:40.310 --> 15:41.584
Mr. Murtaugh has a gun.

15:41.790 --> 15:44.987
Yeah, but it's an old gun,
and he's not a very good shot.

15:45.830 --> 15:48.219
That's good.
I'm going anyway. Good night.

15:48.430 --> 15:51.024
- I'll buy you a beer.
- Let him buy the beer.

15:51.230 --> 15:52.379
You're under 21.

15:52.590 --> 15:54.262
Be back by midnight.

15:55.270 --> 15:57.659
Wait and see.
Cops never let up, you know?

15:57.870 --> 16:01.419
I'll have rubbers on my desk,
in the mail, in the coffee...

16:01.630 --> 16:06.021
If you'd only shut your mouth. You
told everybody. I'm going for a walk.

16:06.230 --> 16:09.222
Give the boys some credit.
In one ear, out the rubber.

16:21.910 --> 16:23.866
How goes it with you, Hans?

16:24.070 --> 16:26.425
Okay. You, Pieter?

16:27.150 --> 16:30.108
That's quite enough of that.
Come on over here, Hans.

16:31.950 --> 16:35.386
Mind the plastic.
I'm having some painting done.

16:36.150 --> 16:38.823
The important thing is,
are you all right?

16:39.270 --> 16:41.022
No bones broken?

16:41.630 --> 16:42.904
I'm fine, thank you.

16:43.110 --> 16:44.748
Just bumps and bruises, eh?

16:45.510 --> 16:46.829
Yeah, that's all.

16:47.070 --> 16:48.549
Good, good.

16:51.910 --> 16:54.629
However, we did lose over $ 1 million
in Krugerrand.

16:56.070 --> 16:58.948
I know. I'm sorry, Mr. Rudd.

16:59.550 --> 17:00.824
It happens.

17:01.110 --> 17:02.907
It's not your fault.

17:03.270 --> 17:06.147
Sometimes these things
do not go as planned.

17:06.829 --> 17:10.185
As you say, they just happen,
eh, Pieter?

17:18.030 --> 17:21.067
You give a whole new meaning
to the word "dropcloth."

17:21.950 --> 17:25.784
Certain policemen in this city
have become an intolerable nuisance.

17:26.430 --> 17:30.742
They are obviously onto us again.
How do you propose to handle it?

17:30.950 --> 17:32.383
Warn them off.

17:34.030 --> 17:35.588
It's my experience...

17:36.390 --> 17:39.348
...that a scared cop is
more useful than a dead one.

17:39.550 --> 17:40.903
A warning?

17:41.150 --> 17:42.902
Is that not a bit tame?

17:43.430 --> 17:44.658
Depends how you do it.

17:46.470 --> 17:48.347
Then you'd better look at this.

17:54.510 --> 17:57.866
This is the policeman in charge.

18:00.390 --> 18:01.584
<i>Goddamn kaffir.</i>

18:03.190 --> 18:04.305
Lovely.

18:05.350 --> 18:06.863
Remember to take these in order.

18:07.870 --> 18:10.589
There's a packet
for each day of the week.

18:11.230 --> 18:12.060
Thank you.

18:12.270 --> 18:13.498
This yours?

18:14.430 --> 18:15.863
I found it in the wash.

18:20.470 --> 18:21.300
Thanks.

18:22.350 --> 18:23.829
I keep on losing this.

18:24.910 --> 18:25.945
Something's wrong.

18:26.190 --> 18:29.626
No, not really.
It's just a goddamn pen.

18:32.470 --> 18:33.744
What about the pen?

18:34.190 --> 18:36.067
It just reminds me of something.

18:37.030 --> 18:38.099
Reminds you of what?

18:38.910 --> 18:40.389
It reminds me of...

18:40.710 --> 18:42.462
...the night Vicki was killed.

18:43.630 --> 18:44.858
I didn't mean to push.

18:46.350 --> 18:48.944
That's okay.
We never really talked about this.

18:53.750 --> 18:57.948
I was supposed to meet her for dinner,
one of those romantic dinners for two.

18:58.190 --> 18:59.509
I had so much work.

19:01.830 --> 19:03.627
I forgot about the whole thing.

19:05.270 --> 19:09.388
She waited at the restaurant for
an hour before she drove home alone.

19:10.910 --> 19:14.903
It was midnight when I got home
to a ringing phone, so I answered it.

19:15.150 --> 19:17.459
They told me she was killed
in a car crash.

19:22.790 --> 19:25.941
I should've been driving.
We'd have been all right.

19:28.270 --> 19:32.058
I remember falling down on my knees,
and I started shaking all over.

19:32.270 --> 19:35.023
I remember thinking,
"I'm just losing it."

19:36.030 --> 19:38.544
So there I was,
lying on the living room floor.

19:39.750 --> 19:43.425
Lying there, and I'm seeing under
the couch, and I see this gold pen...

19:44.510 --> 19:45.738
...just lying there.

19:45.950 --> 19:49.545
I'd been looking for it everywhere
for two months. There it is.

19:51.230 --> 19:53.266
She wasn't much of a housekeeper.

19:54.870 --> 19:58.260
This voice goes off inside my head,
like a drill instructor.

19:59.230 --> 20:01.539
It said, "Get up! Now!"

20:02.870 --> 20:05.100
I didn't feel like it,
but I got up.

20:05.310 --> 20:07.141
Muscles were still working.

20:07.430 --> 20:09.785
Then I drove to the hospital...

20:10.270 --> 20:13.182
...identified her
and signed her out with my gold pen.

20:13.390 --> 20:16.541
Gold pen? Trish found
a gold pen in the laundry.

20:25.550 --> 20:27.939
Look around you, Sam.
Look around you.

20:29.190 --> 20:30.908
One day, Sam...

20:31.590 --> 20:33.308
...this'll all be yours.

20:36.630 --> 20:39.622
Find a nice bitch,
raise a couple of pups.

20:40.390 --> 20:42.540
A man could live here and be happy.

20:46.630 --> 20:50.305
Anybody tell you if you sit on
cold rocks too long, you'll get piles?

20:50.510 --> 20:52.228
Let's go watch some TV.

22:17.790 --> 22:19.064
<i>Kaffirs!</i>

22:22.230 --> 22:23.709
Wondering about your kids?

22:24.870 --> 22:26.906
You wondering what we done to them?

22:27.870 --> 22:30.259
If I was you, I'd be going nuts now.

22:31.390 --> 22:33.540
I'd be going fucking bananas.

22:34.470 --> 22:36.108
Want to know what we done?

22:36.630 --> 22:37.426
Shall I tell you?

22:39.390 --> 22:41.950
You just let your imagination
run riot.

22:42.670 --> 22:44.501
This has just been a warning.

22:44.830 --> 22:48.459
After this, it gets bloody.
You tell your people to back off.

22:48.670 --> 22:50.308
<i>Don't be a smart kaffir.</i>

22:50.950 --> 22:53.623
Maybe we let you live, huh?
Come on, let's go.

23:12.670 --> 23:15.548
- You didn't see a face?
- Not one. They all had on hoods.

23:15.750 --> 23:16.944
What about a voice?

23:17.150 --> 23:21.541
That motherfucker who did talk had a
strange accent. I couldn't place it.

23:21.750 --> 23:23.342
Not German, not English.

23:23.550 --> 23:26.269
Kind of guttural.
You know, a shitty accent.

23:26.470 --> 23:29.780
Anything like what we were chasing
the other night?

23:30.070 --> 23:32.379
Yeah, kind of like that.

23:32.790 --> 23:34.143
Trish and the kids?

23:34.350 --> 23:37.103
They're at her sister's house
in Bellflower.

23:37.310 --> 23:41.462
Listen up. You all heard about
what happened to Rog last night?

23:41.750 --> 23:43.661
Forensics get back with anything?

23:43.870 --> 23:45.906
Nothing yet. They'll keep us posted.

23:46.230 --> 23:49.427
The point being, we gotta watch
each other's backs and fronts.

23:49.630 --> 23:53.339
You're all invited to watch my back
in poker tomorrow. You in?

23:53.550 --> 23:56.428
- Lf we catch these assholes.
- Count me in.

24:01.790 --> 24:04.350
I got something special for you boys.

24:04.550 --> 24:07.383
Leo Getz has been placed
in protective custody.

24:07.590 --> 24:11.185
You guys are gonna babysit him
until Washington sends the feds.

24:11.510 --> 24:14.502
- How long?
- Soon as the red tape is processed.

24:14.710 --> 24:15.859
Three days.

24:16.190 --> 24:20.149
This guy Getz is gonna testify
before a commission of inquiry.

24:20.350 --> 24:22.420
Drugs, laundered money, et cetera.

24:22.910 --> 24:24.741
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

24:26.270 --> 24:27.862
This is not a shit assignment.

24:28.190 --> 24:30.146
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

24:30.350 --> 24:32.181
- It isn't.
- It's a shit assignment.

24:32.390 --> 24:33.823
Shut up, the both of you.

24:34.070 --> 24:35.105
Here you go, sir.

24:35.310 --> 24:37.619
- I guaranteed this guy's safety.
- Why us?

24:37.830 --> 24:41.027
Because you two are
the most qualified for the job.

24:41.270 --> 24:44.023
And after last night,
you could use the break.

24:44.230 --> 24:45.504
I can handle last night.

24:46.670 --> 24:47.864
What do we do with him?

24:48.110 --> 24:50.305
How should I know?
Take him to Disneyland.

24:50.510 --> 24:52.228
This stinks. This stinks.

24:52.430 --> 24:53.579
I don't give a fuck.

24:53.790 --> 24:56.782
I don't have an ulcer,
because I know when to say that.

24:57.030 --> 24:59.385
Here's where he's staying.
It's a nice hotel.

24:59.590 --> 25:02.787
Expenses are paid by the Justice
Department, so enjoy yourselves.

25:03.950 --> 25:05.303
One more thing.

25:08.190 --> 25:09.066
Know what that says?

25:09.470 --> 25:12.064
Same thing as that.
But I don't give a fuck.

25:15.870 --> 25:18.623
You're lucky.
I have to live with that.

25:31.070 --> 25:32.469
What a joint!

25:33.910 --> 25:36.219
Excuse me, ma'am, where's the lobby?

25:37.430 --> 25:38.579
That's this way.

25:39.430 --> 25:41.386
Hey, come on. Come on.

25:41.950 --> 25:44.669
What I wouldn't pay to have this pool
in my back yard.

25:44.870 --> 25:45.746
You can't swim.

25:45.950 --> 25:47.668
I could get my stroke down.

25:49.550 --> 25:51.347
- What's the water like?
- Great.

25:51.550 --> 25:54.303
- How's the temperature?
- Great. Why don't you come in?

25:54.510 --> 25:58.901
As an employee, I can't get into these
things. If I get caught, I get fired.

25:59.150 --> 26:01.345
Everything okay for you at the hotel?

26:01.550 --> 26:03.586
No problem?
Nothing I can do for you?

26:03.790 --> 26:06.827
Excuse me. I see you're coming out
of your shell.

26:07.070 --> 26:08.981
- Hotel psychiatrist.
- Join us also.

26:09.190 --> 26:12.739
Our patient, Mr. Getz, is waiting
for us upstairs.

26:12.950 --> 26:14.269
Want to talk to Mr. Murphy?

26:14.470 --> 26:16.665
Yeah, I gotta go to work. Bye.

26:17.310 --> 26:19.062
- Come back.
- We'll be waiting.

26:19.270 --> 26:21.625
Can any of you cook?

26:23.070 --> 26:24.742
Let's go. Murphy.

26:24.950 --> 26:28.022
The girls in this place.
This is where they live in the day.

26:28.230 --> 26:30.505
This is where my tax money goes too.

26:30.710 --> 26:32.189
Leo lives like this.

26:32.390 --> 26:34.108
Where's the elevator?

26:34.310 --> 26:36.062
Down the hall to the right.

26:36.270 --> 26:38.659
Are you gentlemen guests of the hotel?

26:43.230 --> 26:44.424
Excuse me.

26:44.870 --> 26:46.428
What room is that for?

26:46.710 --> 26:47.586
612.

26:50.350 --> 26:52.068
This is it. 612.

26:54.590 --> 26:55.864
- Who is it?
- Police.

26:56.590 --> 26:57.784
How do I know that?

26:58.150 --> 27:01.460
After I shoot you through the door,
you can examine the bullet.

27:03.270 --> 27:05.340
Don't you want to see a badge?

27:05.550 --> 27:06.903
- Where's your badge?
- Shut up.

27:07.110 --> 27:09.385
I get it.
Bad cop, good cop.

27:09.750 --> 27:11.069
Shut up!

27:12.270 --> 27:14.420
Bad cop, bad cop.
I know the routines.

27:14.630 --> 27:17.463
- Are you Leo Getz?
- That's me, Leo Getz.

27:17.710 --> 27:21.100
Whatever you need, Leo gets.
You get it?

27:21.550 --> 27:24.223
I use that to break the ice
when I meet people.

27:24.510 --> 27:26.421
I'm Sgt. Murtaugh.
This is Sgt. Riggs.

27:26.630 --> 27:29.747
How you doing? Nice to meet you.
What do I call you guys?

27:29.950 --> 27:33.101
- Sgt. Murtaugh and Sgt. Riggs.
- We're gonna be your shadow.

27:35.230 --> 27:37.141
That's all right.
An old-fashioned...!

27:38.510 --> 27:41.422
Okay. I just ain't seen one
in a long time.

27:41.630 --> 27:44.349
I didn't think anybody
used those things anymore.

27:44.550 --> 27:47.508
I'll bet you the kid's got
an automatic. Got an automatic?

27:47.710 --> 27:48.825
Yep, a Beretta.

27:49.030 --> 27:50.224
Don't touch it.

27:51.070 --> 27:52.503
You sure you guys are cops?

27:53.470 --> 27:57.019
Better watch how you treat me.
I'm the state's star witness.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.148
We'll take that room.

28:00.910 --> 28:04.698
Actually, I already have my stuff
in this room. You know, when I...

28:10.670 --> 28:12.422
It's yours. My stuff's gone.

28:12.630 --> 28:14.746
I'll move it in the small room, okay?

28:15.190 --> 28:18.500
I'm the smallest guy here.
I'll take the small room.

28:18.710 --> 28:22.589
Come on, loosen up a little, guys.
We'll be together a long time.

28:23.590 --> 28:24.500
I'll get it.

28:25.590 --> 28:27.785
It's only room service.

28:28.030 --> 28:30.544
You hungry? I'll call
and get anything you want.

28:30.750 --> 28:33.139
See this silk robe?
Silk pajamas? Free!

28:33.350 --> 28:34.908
- It's not free.
- Yes, it is!

28:35.110 --> 28:38.068
- It's taxpayers'money.
- Oh, God! It's the same thing.

28:41.550 --> 28:43.029
Good morning, gentlemen.

28:46.750 --> 28:50.345
That's my food! You guys didn't
want anything. Bring it here.

28:51.110 --> 28:52.668
It's mine. Boy!

28:53.030 --> 28:55.260
You could've had anything you wanted.

28:55.870 --> 28:57.542
I ordered eggs, not hamburger.

29:03.390 --> 29:04.903
Martin, not the window!

29:07.630 --> 29:08.665
Shit!

29:33.350 --> 29:34.703
Where is that son of a bitch?

29:36.510 --> 29:39.104
Somebody stop that guy!
Stop him!

29:40.830 --> 29:44.061
Don't leave me! I can't swim!

29:44.710 --> 29:46.382
Get off me!

29:46.590 --> 29:47.545
Get off me!

29:49.470 --> 29:53.907
We're near the edge of the pool.
Now get the fuck off my back.

29:54.310 --> 29:56.505
Clear, move it! Get back! Police!

29:57.710 --> 29:58.506
You all right?

29:58.710 --> 30:01.383
I'm okay.
Why didn't you follow me down?

30:01.590 --> 30:03.899
- Why didn't you?
- I was seven floors up!

30:05.190 --> 30:06.225
He hit me.

30:06.430 --> 30:07.419
Good!

30:09.470 --> 30:12.268
This guy took an awful chance
to pop all of us.

30:12.470 --> 30:14.188
Did you witness a murder?

30:14.390 --> 30:16.426
No, nothing like that. Honest.

30:18.790 --> 30:23.181
All I did was, I laundered
half a billion dollars in drug money.

30:24.230 --> 30:26.141
Half a billion dollars?

30:26.350 --> 30:29.820
Give or take a few.
Who could count with that much money?

30:30.070 --> 30:33.346
Could I please have some cotton balls
for my nose?

30:33.790 --> 30:35.428
Could you please shut up?

30:36.070 --> 30:38.743
- You're supposed to take care of me.
- Shut up!

30:39.510 --> 30:43.503
Mr. Getz got away. Our best
opportunity, and he gets away.

30:43.710 --> 30:48.261
He slips right through our fingers
and into the hands of the police.

30:48.870 --> 30:50.098
What are you doing?

30:50.950 --> 30:54.260
Just checking to see
if I was standing on plastic.

30:54.990 --> 30:56.787
Okay, I got it. Okay, here.

30:57.230 --> 31:00.620
I'm who I am. You're a drug dealer.
I work in a bank.

31:00.830 --> 31:03.344
You have money to launder.
What do you do?

31:03.670 --> 31:04.785
I bring it to you.

31:06.150 --> 31:09.028
- He does.
- Me? I don't understand. Why me?

31:09.390 --> 31:10.505
Who am I?

31:10.750 --> 31:12.183
I'll tell you.

31:12.390 --> 31:14.665
You're a courier. You work for him.

31:14.910 --> 31:16.662
I'm the drug dealer.

31:19.790 --> 31:23.419
Don't you have plates?
Here. Come on. What is this?

31:25.190 --> 31:29.547
I deposit the cash into the account
of a dummy finance company.

31:30.750 --> 31:33.787
Then I issue you a cashier's check
in his name...

31:34.190 --> 31:36.624
...minus a small commission
for myself.

31:37.630 --> 31:39.302
- You like breathing?
- How much?

31:39.510 --> 31:40.625
Two percent.

31:41.190 --> 31:44.182
Not bad, Leo. Pretty prosperous.

31:46.110 --> 31:49.227
You give it back to me as collateral
on a loan I make to you.

31:49.430 --> 31:52.820
But you don't pay back the loan.
You keep the money.

31:53.070 --> 31:54.025
How's that work?

31:54.230 --> 31:56.744
How's what? That's it!
Don't you get it?

31:56.950 --> 32:00.704
It's your money. You don't pay
it back. It's yours, and it's clean!

32:00.910 --> 32:03.026
It is now laundered.

32:04.430 --> 32:06.580
You cops aren't too bright, are you?

32:08.350 --> 32:10.420
This is the best part. You got it?

32:11.030 --> 32:13.703
You take a tax deduction...

32:14.310 --> 32:17.541
...on interest payments
that you don't even make.

32:18.950 --> 32:21.305
- Am I a genius?
- You're a swindler.

32:21.510 --> 32:22.420
Cheat!

32:22.670 --> 32:23.944
Come on.

32:24.350 --> 32:26.818
Everybody cheats.
Look at the Pentagon.

32:27.070 --> 32:28.298
So you got it?

32:30.230 --> 32:33.142
Okay, Mr. Big Shot,
how come you turned yourself in?

32:33.630 --> 32:35.780
I was scamming those guys for months.

32:36.230 --> 32:38.107
Every transaction, I kept a little.

32:38.310 --> 32:39.186
You?

32:39.630 --> 32:41.700
It was easy.
All those cash deposits.

32:42.030 --> 32:45.147
Millions of dollars in small bills
changing hands.

32:45.350 --> 32:48.387
Who's gonna miss $ 10,000 here,
$ 20,000 there?

32:49.270 --> 32:50.589
Drug dealers.

32:51.190 --> 32:52.748
That's right. They did.

32:53.110 --> 32:55.670
That's why I'm living
out of a suitcase now.

32:58.150 --> 32:59.708
You can give that to Nick.

33:00.270 --> 33:03.228
I'll bet you it's softer.
I put fabric softener in.

33:03.430 --> 33:04.419
It's small, Leroy.

33:04.630 --> 33:08.623
It's not Leroy, it's Leo. And if
you want, I'll buy you another shirt!

33:08.830 --> 33:11.663
Do me a favor. Give me the names
of those drug dealers.

33:11.870 --> 33:15.499
I don't know any drug dealers.
All I dealt with was couriers.

33:15.710 --> 33:19.544
- Where does Trish keep my laundry?
- On the shelf in back of the machine.

33:20.910 --> 33:23.219
You never met anyone except couriers?

33:24.790 --> 33:26.143
No names.

33:29.270 --> 33:32.182
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Come to think of it...

33:32.510 --> 33:33.545
Okay, listen.

33:33.870 --> 33:37.579
They took me up to the hills
in this house with stilts on it.

33:37.790 --> 33:40.588
And I had a job interview
with a guy...

33:40.830 --> 33:42.741
...and his name was...

33:43.670 --> 33:45.149
...Haynes. Hans!

33:45.350 --> 33:47.580
- Take us there.
- We have to sit on this guy.

33:47.790 --> 33:49.542
It won't do any harm to look.

33:49.910 --> 33:51.946
- I know the address.
- Let's go.

33:52.150 --> 33:53.060
We shouldn't!

33:53.270 --> 33:55.226
Come on, don't be a killjoy!

33:55.430 --> 33:57.898
We're back, we're bad!
You're black, I'm mad.

33:58.110 --> 33:59.828
This is going to be great!

34:00.150 --> 34:02.903
If we're going,
shouldn't I have a gun?

34:05.270 --> 34:07.659
Is my nose still bleeding?
It's really sore.

34:07.870 --> 34:09.462
I'm sorry about that.

34:16.630 --> 34:19.667
That's downtown L.A.
How'd you like to have a house here?

34:19.870 --> 34:23.179
It'd be okay three days of the year
when you can actually see it.

34:23.389 --> 34:24.902
Get a fresh breath.

34:26.469 --> 34:29.462
It's been two hours and six places.
You sure of the address?

34:29.670 --> 34:32.309
I told you I wasn't sure
of the exact address.

34:32.510 --> 34:33.659
What are you sure of?

34:33.870 --> 34:35.746
I'm sure the numbers add up to 28.

34:35.949 --> 34:39.989
I remember because I was 28 when I
became a certified public accountant.

34:40.790 --> 34:42.348
We can figure this out.

34:42.550 --> 34:45.268
There's four numbers.
The first one has to be a nine.

34:45.469 --> 34:49.349
Nine is my lucky number. I was born
on the ninth day of the ninth month.

34:50.190 --> 34:53.466
- This is ridiculous.
- Hang on. Maybe not, maybe not.

34:55.310 --> 34:58.302
There aren't many streets
in Bel Air that begin with nine...

34:58.510 --> 35:00.466
...with four numbers in the address.

35:00.670 --> 35:03.423
- How many's not that many?
- Let's have a look.

35:08.590 --> 35:11.343
Well, I meant more than
10 or 12 streets.

35:11.550 --> 35:13.859
This is thin, Riggs.
This is very thin.

35:14.110 --> 35:15.509
This is anorexic.

35:16.030 --> 35:19.420
- Such as 739, 658.

35:19.630 --> 35:20.949
Okay, that's it.

35:21.310 --> 35:22.379
That's it.

35:23.030 --> 35:24.907
Look. This is it. See?

35:25.150 --> 35:28.028
The last three numbers have to be
either 739 or 658.

35:28.230 --> 35:31.540
The first number's gotta be a 9
because 9 was my lucky number.

35:31.750 --> 35:34.583
I was born on the ninth day...
See, that's it.

35:34.790 --> 35:36.348
I tell you, I could do it.

35:36.550 --> 35:37.460
Take us there.

35:37.670 --> 35:40.059
- We need a street, that's all.
- Is that all?

35:41.590 --> 35:44.024
- How's that?
- Good enough for me.

35:44.870 --> 35:46.747
Leo, this is the seventh place.

35:46.950 --> 35:49.225
- We have the numbers.
- And the seventh time.

35:49.430 --> 35:52.069
- Just jumble them around.
- It's a lucky number.

35:55.430 --> 35:57.148
It should be coming up soon.

35:57.390 --> 35:59.585
- 9856.
- That's it.

35:59.790 --> 36:02.987
- That's another possibility.
- This is the ninth possibility.

36:03.190 --> 36:06.182
That's it! Nine. My lucky number.

36:06.510 --> 36:08.626
Stay in the car, you hear?

36:09.910 --> 36:11.662
- Can't I come?
- Stay.

36:13.870 --> 36:15.144
Nice car.

36:15.590 --> 36:17.421
- What are you doing?
- Hooking it up.

36:17.630 --> 36:19.621
You're not looking
at what you're doing!

36:19.830 --> 36:23.709
I know what I'm doing. I'm towing
your car, not a baby carriage.

36:23.910 --> 36:26.060
You're chipping the paint.
I can hear it!

36:27.030 --> 36:29.783
- You smell what I smell?
- I smell something.

36:29.990 --> 36:31.469
What's that? A rat?

36:31.950 --> 36:33.747
A stinky one too.

36:37.110 --> 36:38.304
Where you going?

36:38.510 --> 36:41.070
I'm a peeping Tom.
It goes with the badge.

36:41.310 --> 36:42.709
It's fun sometimes too.

36:44.630 --> 36:45.460
Bingo!

36:49.590 --> 36:50.989
Lars, look!

36:51.190 --> 36:52.942
What the fuck?

36:57.710 --> 36:59.587
- Where's the pool?
- There's no pool.

36:59.990 --> 37:00.900
There's no pool.

37:01.110 --> 37:02.941
This house is built on stilts.

37:03.150 --> 37:05.220
Stilts? No, I'm sure there's a pool.

37:16.630 --> 37:17.949
Cuff yourselves.

37:24.670 --> 37:26.228
Not this again.

37:37.910 --> 37:39.582
Riggs! Where you at?

37:40.310 --> 37:42.585
Stay where you are. Don't move.

37:43.190 --> 37:44.418
You all right?

37:44.630 --> 37:45.779
Move that truck.

37:47.430 --> 37:48.419
Give me your keys!

37:50.790 --> 37:51.984
You all right?

37:52.710 --> 37:53.665
Where you going?

37:53.870 --> 37:55.269
That was the hotel waiter.

37:55.470 --> 37:56.425
Wait for me!

37:57.110 --> 37:58.225
Get out of here!

37:58.430 --> 38:02.184
What are you doing? You can't
take my truck! What's going on?

38:04.910 --> 38:06.901
Don't worry.
We'll bring it right back.

38:13.870 --> 38:14.746
Gotcha!

38:14.950 --> 38:17.180
Sergeant, it's the guy from the hotel!

38:17.430 --> 38:18.658
Where did he go?

38:19.470 --> 38:21.188
Riggs is hanging on the truck!

38:21.430 --> 38:24.661
What are you doing out of the car?
Get in the car!

38:25.470 --> 38:27.665
Get back! It's police business!

38:28.030 --> 38:30.749
It's a high-speed chase!
Get out of the way!

38:49.030 --> 38:51.703
Go faster! We gotta catch him
and your partner.

39:06.510 --> 39:07.909
Hello, asshole!

39:36.630 --> 39:38.780
Come on, come on. Give me that!

39:54.150 --> 39:56.618
There they are! Hurry up!

39:56.830 --> 39:58.627
Come on! Can't you go faster?

39:58.830 --> 40:00.786
Will you shut the fuck up?

40:07.990 --> 40:08.979
Look out!

40:49.110 --> 40:50.509
Oh, shit!

41:15.310 --> 41:17.426
Wipeout! It's all under control.

41:17.630 --> 41:19.541
I told you to look out!

41:21.830 --> 41:24.503
- You're too old to drive this car.
- Shut up!

41:24.950 --> 41:25.860
And stay!

41:26.070 --> 41:27.742
What do you think I am, a dog?

41:41.430 --> 41:42.943
Hands behind your neck!

41:47.870 --> 41:51.067
What are you doing here?
We got a lot to talk about.

41:51.310 --> 41:52.379
What's going on?

41:52.590 --> 41:53.659
Freeze, dickhead!

41:54.870 --> 41:57.384
Get down here, dickhead.
It's been a bad day.

41:57.590 --> 41:58.705
Show me your hands.

41:58.910 --> 42:00.787
Take it easy, officer.

42:01.070 --> 42:04.142
I'm not armed. I won't resist.

42:05.030 --> 42:07.908
Put down your guns, gentlemen.
It's all right.

42:08.230 --> 42:09.743
Do as I say!

42:14.070 --> 42:15.708
Get your hands on your head.

42:16.030 --> 42:17.543
Lace them behind your head!

42:17.750 --> 42:19.422
You have no idea what you're doing.

42:19.990 --> 42:23.869
We're professional police officers.
We do this for a living.

42:24.350 --> 42:26.181
My name is Arjen Rudd.

42:26.430 --> 42:30.742
I'm minister of diplomatic affairs
for the South African Consulate.

42:31.670 --> 42:33.547
South Africa,
home of the Krugerrand.

42:33.750 --> 42:35.229
Among other things.

42:35.510 --> 42:38.149
These gentlemen also work
for the consulate.

42:38.350 --> 42:40.545
We have diplomatic credentials...

42:42.470 --> 42:44.028
Keep your hands high.

42:47.870 --> 42:49.098
Give me that.

42:52.310 --> 42:55.029
Everybody take it easy.
Especially you, Riggs.

42:55.230 --> 42:57.949
Riggs? You Martin Riggs?

42:58.310 --> 43:01.143
Of the Chicago Riggses.
What's your name?

43:01.630 --> 43:02.904
Pieter Von... Vor...

43:03.110 --> 43:04.862
Fuck, I'll just call you Adolf.

43:05.790 --> 43:08.509
Are you Arjen Rudd? Aryan...?

43:09.790 --> 43:11.667
- That's you.
- It's official.

43:12.950 --> 43:14.178
They are official.

43:15.030 --> 43:17.225
Under the Diplomatic Relations Act...

43:17.550 --> 43:20.940
...no diplomatic agent
may be detained or arrested...

43:21.150 --> 43:24.062
Once his identity
has been established.

43:25.910 --> 43:29.141
We do have a serious
diplomatic situation here...

43:29.510 --> 43:32.820
...which I'll take up with your
State Department tomorrow.

43:33.030 --> 43:35.942
I'm quaking in my boots,
but I'll still bring you down.

43:36.990 --> 43:38.708
My dear officer...

43:39.790 --> 43:42.429
...you could not even give me
a parking ticket.

43:45.510 --> 43:47.387
Who is the dickhead now?

43:50.590 --> 43:53.468
This house is owned by
the South African government.

43:53.670 --> 43:55.661
This is South African soil.

43:55.870 --> 43:57.588
Now get out of here.

43:58.670 --> 43:59.705
All of you.

44:04.350 --> 44:05.829
Come on, let's go.

44:08.190 --> 44:09.464
Hey, man, don't do it.

44:09.670 --> 44:14.141
Don't fucking do it. Fuck with me,
and I'll make you eat this thing.

44:16.510 --> 44:17.659
<i>Kaffir!</i>

44:19.510 --> 44:22.149
With those credentials,
Chuck Manson could get off.

44:22.390 --> 44:24.540
- I went to school with him.
- Yeah, right.

44:26.310 --> 44:29.541
Miss, could you step out
of the car, please?

44:31.390 --> 44:33.506
Put them away. I'm sorry.

44:35.190 --> 44:36.543
I'm sorry. Are you...?

44:38.390 --> 44:39.379
Don't open that.

44:40.510 --> 44:42.023
That is a diplomatic pouch...

44:42.230 --> 44:45.745
...protected under Article 27
of the Vienna Convention.

44:46.110 --> 44:47.907
Is he serious with this stuff?

44:49.590 --> 44:52.150
These are police officers,
Miss Van Den Haas.

44:52.510 --> 44:53.784
They were just leaving.

44:56.390 --> 44:58.142
She is a consulate secretary.

44:59.110 --> 45:00.782
Give her back the briefcase.

45:03.590 --> 45:04.909
Give it to her.

45:07.110 --> 45:09.704
Here. I'm sorry,
Miss Consulate Secretary.

45:11.390 --> 45:12.903
Don't talk to them! Come here.

45:13.110 --> 45:15.749
He's a nice guy.
What's he paying you an hour?

45:15.950 --> 45:18.544
How'd you like to increase your pay?
Better hours?

45:25.510 --> 45:27.944
I'd start getting used to
that sort of view.

45:36.670 --> 45:38.706
- It's the Triangle Trade again.
- The what?

45:38.910 --> 45:41.504
Didn't you ever do American history
at school?

45:41.710 --> 45:43.507
From molasses to rum to slaves.

45:43.710 --> 45:45.746
Now it's drugs to dollars
to Krugerrands.

45:45.950 --> 45:49.579
I know there's a dead guy
with a surfboard where his face was...

45:49.790 --> 45:53.100
...and the State Department's
breathing down our throats.

45:53.310 --> 45:57.588
I'll have to make a formal apology
to the South African Consulate.

45:57.790 --> 45:58.905
Apologize?

45:59.150 --> 46:01.300
He's a sack of shit!
He's dirty, a crook.

45:36.670 --> 45:38.706
- It's the Triangle Trade again.
- The what?

45:38.910 --> 45:41.504
Didn't you ever do American history
at school?

45:41.710 --> 45:43.507
From molasses to rum to slaves.

45:43.710 --> 45:45.746
Now it's drugs to dollars
to Krugerrands.

45:45.950 --> 45:49.579
I know there's a dead guy
with a surfboard where his face was...

45:49.790 --> 45:53.100
...and the State Department's
breathing down our throats.

45:53.310 --> 45:57.588
I'll have to make a formal apology
to the South African Consulate.

45:57.790 --> 45:58.905
Apologize?

45:59.150 --> 46:01.300
He's a sack of shit!
He's dirty, a crook.

46:01.510 --> 46:04.149
It doesn't matter if he's dirty.
He's a diplomat.

46:04.350 --> 46:08.468
He's got immunity. We can't
touch him, arrest him, prosecute him.

46:08.670 --> 46:10.820
Is that clear?
Does that spell it out?

46:11.030 --> 46:11.860
Yes, sir.

46:12.070 --> 46:15.540
- Who the hell is this guy?
- Leo Getz. Nice to meet you, sir.

46:17.390 --> 46:21.861
You took a civilian on a bust.
A civilian you're supposed to protect!

46:22.070 --> 46:24.903
- He's alive, isn't he?
- It's okay. I signed a waiver.

46:25.110 --> 46:28.420
- Besides, I usually wait in the car.
- Usually? Usually?

46:28.630 --> 46:30.586
They're very adamant about that.

46:30.790 --> 46:33.862
- I don't give a fuck.
- They're good cops. They're the best.

46:34.070 --> 46:36.220
One time, a guy was waving a gun...

46:36.470 --> 46:37.664
What'd he say?

46:39.750 --> 46:40.785
What did he say?

46:40.990 --> 46:43.220
"I don't give a fuck."
It's his mantra.

46:43.430 --> 46:46.422
Why is everybody's ass parked
on my desk? Up! Up!

46:47.790 --> 46:49.109
It's a rubber plant!

46:49.430 --> 46:52.149
I had nothing to do with it.
Looks like a week's supply.

46:52.390 --> 46:53.300
Go spit.

46:53.510 --> 46:56.547
I'm sorry, I forgot.
You're too old for that shit.

46:59.110 --> 47:01.578
If you don't like it,
you can exchange it.

47:17.510 --> 47:19.068
Thank you, Mr. Rudd.

47:24.310 --> 47:26.460
One moment, Miss Van Den Haas.

47:30.630 --> 47:33.622
I hope you understood
what was happening here today.

47:33.830 --> 47:36.549
I'd rather not jump
to any wrong conclusions.

47:36.950 --> 47:38.941
Why don't you explain it to me?

47:39.350 --> 47:43.662
The policies of our government are not
popular here in America, as you know.

47:43.990 --> 47:47.505
The police department of this city
is overrun with blacks.

47:48.110 --> 47:51.022
They have badges and guns,
and they hate us.

47:51.630 --> 47:53.666
Our consulate, its staff...

47:53.990 --> 47:58.108
...and particularly myself, will always
be targets for their harassment.

48:05.310 --> 48:07.028
Good night, Mr. Rudd.

48:17.910 --> 48:19.741
Things are getting out of hand.

48:19.990 --> 48:22.106
We are suffering too many losses.

48:22.510 --> 48:25.104
We have to move the cash
in one large shipment.

48:25.350 --> 48:27.659
We'll need something bigger
than a suitcase.

48:27.870 --> 48:31.579
I'll worry about that.
You worry about the police.

48:31.790 --> 48:34.384
Your warning did not work.

48:41.950 --> 48:43.827
- Come on, Leo, let's go!
- I'm coming.

48:44.030 --> 48:46.100
Come on! Move!

48:46.390 --> 48:48.540
Okay! Hey, they're cops, okay?

48:48.750 --> 48:51.469
- Big deal. I've gotta eat too.
- Come on, Leo.

48:52.190 --> 48:53.748
Give me the food.

48:58.710 --> 49:01.622
- Who ordered the super combo?
- Over here.

49:02.110 --> 49:03.748
I get a steak sandwich.

49:04.030 --> 49:04.940
Who gets Leo?

49:05.310 --> 49:07.028
You got a big, empty house.

49:07.230 --> 49:09.460
I got a trailer.
What will I do with him?

49:09.670 --> 49:11.865
My place is too small. You take him.

49:12.070 --> 49:13.389
I had him last night.

49:13.590 --> 49:15.023
Excuse me, fellas!

49:16.070 --> 49:18.186
This is tuna. I hate tuna.

49:18.470 --> 49:21.143
I refuse to get stuck with tuna.
Now, come on.

49:21.830 --> 49:24.788
- Don't eat the tuna.
- Where were you? I just said that!

49:25.190 --> 49:27.420
I'm not eating tuna. Let's go back.

49:27.630 --> 49:29.109
We're not going back. Shut up!

49:29.310 --> 49:32.143
Sure, don't go back.
Okay, don't go back. That's it.

49:32.350 --> 49:35.467
Can I give you two guys
a friendly piece of advice?

49:35.670 --> 49:39.140
Never go up to the drive-through.
Always walk up to the counter.

49:39.390 --> 49:41.187
You know why? Let me tell you.

49:41.550 --> 49:44.906
They fuck you
at the drive-through, okay?

49:45.110 --> 49:48.944
They know you'll be miles away
before you find out you got fucked.

49:49.150 --> 49:51.380
They know you won't
turn around and go back.

49:51.590 --> 49:54.309
They don't care.
Who gets fucked? Leo Getz! Sure!

49:54.510 --> 49:56.228
I'm not eating this tuna!

49:56.470 --> 49:57.903
Shut up!

51:07.790 --> 51:09.223
Good morning, Mr. Rudd.

51:09.710 --> 51:11.541
- Get rid of that man.
- Yes, sir.

51:14.190 --> 51:17.341
Sorry, you're gonna have to leave
the premises right now.

51:26.670 --> 51:28.023
The morning faxes.

52:03.790 --> 52:07.180
Sam, come here. What's the matter?
He kick you out of the house?

52:07.670 --> 52:10.423
Here, Sam. I want you
to bite Leo for me.

52:20.950 --> 52:22.349
What are you doing?

52:22.550 --> 52:24.427
I'm cleaning up this pigsty.

52:24.630 --> 52:26.666
I like living the way I live.

52:26.870 --> 52:30.783
When's the last time you did
the refrigerator? The pan under it?

52:30.990 --> 52:33.788
- There's a pan under there?
- Oh, please. Come on.

52:33.990 --> 52:36.629
Where's my phone?
Where the fuck is everything?

52:36.830 --> 52:38.388
Where's my TV?

52:38.590 --> 52:40.387
Everything is outside.

52:40.630 --> 52:42.109
Just stop what you're doing.

52:42.390 --> 52:45.427
- Get the dog out of here!
- You go before the mutt.

52:45.630 --> 52:47.302
Out, out! Oh, man!

52:52.230 --> 52:53.868
<i>Riggs, it's Collins.</i>

52:54.230 --> 52:57.427
<i>- Has Murtaugh checked in with you?
- No, he hasn't. Why?</i>

52:57.630 --> 53:00.702
<i>I haven't heard from him.
He doesn't answer his phone.</i>

53:01.750 --> 53:02.785
I'll be right there.

53:08.430 --> 53:09.783
Stay in the car.

53:09.990 --> 53:11.025
Get in there.

53:17.150 --> 53:18.344
I'm upstairs!

53:18.790 --> 53:20.940
Should I call 999,
"Officer in distress"?

53:22.150 --> 53:23.265
I'll cover the back!

53:23.470 --> 53:25.825
- Where are you?
- I'm up here.

53:41.670 --> 53:42.864
In here.

53:57.190 --> 53:58.179
Good morning.

54:04.710 --> 54:08.339
First time in 20 years
I got the bathroom all to myself.

54:08.550 --> 54:11.940
No kids banging on the door.
No wife asking me to hurry up.

54:12.190 --> 54:15.546
<i>Just me and my new
Salt Water Sportsman magazine.</i>

54:24.430 --> 54:27.661
Is that the one with the article
on deep-sea fishing?

54:36.110 --> 54:40.183
Sitting here reading about marlin
fishing in the Gulf of Mexico...

54:40.990 --> 54:43.220
...when I glanced over,
I saw this.

54:47.590 --> 54:49.148
Oh, Jesus!

54:50.190 --> 54:51.179
Is that all?

54:51.390 --> 54:54.905
- You scared the shit out of me.
- Scared the shit out of you?

54:56.270 --> 54:57.703
How long you been here?

54:57.910 --> 54:59.548
I've been here all night.

54:59.870 --> 55:02.589
My legs are so goddamn numb,
I don't know if I can...

55:02.830 --> 55:04.058
Don't move.

55:04.350 --> 55:05.465
I can't.

55:05.710 --> 55:08.304
Just stay that way. Do you mind?

55:09.350 --> 55:12.023
A dirty job,
but somebody's gotta do it.

55:25.790 --> 55:27.906
Tell me I'm not fucked.

55:28.470 --> 55:29.698
He's fucked.

55:31.750 --> 55:34.025
Okay, but I'd be lying.

55:35.390 --> 55:37.460
You'll be okay if you don't stand up.

55:37.670 --> 55:38.819
That's a relief.

55:39.150 --> 55:41.345
- I'll have to get help.
- No way!

55:41.910 --> 55:43.263
Why?

55:45.030 --> 55:47.180
I'm on the toilet. Give me a break.

55:47.630 --> 55:51.305
This is serious.
I gotta get the Bomb Squad in here.

55:51.510 --> 55:52.545
Bomb Squad?

55:58.190 --> 56:00.146
Okay, call them in.

56:02.990 --> 56:05.788
Call them, but don't use
the open frequency.

56:10.750 --> 56:12.706
Let's keep this quiet, okay?

56:13.550 --> 56:15.063
Sure. Trust me.

56:31.670 --> 56:32.864
Excuse me, please.

56:33.070 --> 56:35.106
Officer, an escort isn't necessary.

56:35.310 --> 56:38.939
I know you're a psychiatrist,
but it's not a pretty sight.

56:39.150 --> 56:42.381
I have helped policemen through
the most traumatic moments.

56:42.630 --> 56:46.145
Believe me, there is nothing
in this room that I cannot handle.

56:48.990 --> 56:50.423
I was wrong.

56:50.750 --> 56:52.229
Excuse me.

56:55.670 --> 56:58.628
I should've known.
Where there's one, there's the other.

57:04.350 --> 57:05.988
Split.

57:06.510 --> 57:08.865
You're the psychiatrist?
I have these dreams.

57:09.270 --> 57:11.226
It's ready to come out.

57:13.310 --> 57:15.221
I gotta live in this house!

57:17.350 --> 57:18.339
Clear this room.

57:20.190 --> 57:21.669
Come on, Riggs.

57:25.430 --> 57:27.148
- You too, Riggs.
- No.

57:28.670 --> 57:30.467
Riggs. Out.

57:37.510 --> 57:38.909
All right.

57:41.150 --> 57:42.378
Dive into the tub.

57:43.230 --> 57:46.063
When you do, pull the bomb blanket
over your head.

57:46.470 --> 57:50.145
This is a good cast-iron tub.
It'll withstand a hell of a blast.

57:50.510 --> 57:51.579
I can't do it.

57:51.790 --> 57:54.748
He can't do it.
He's been on there for 18, 20 hours.

57:54.950 --> 57:56.747
He can't even walk.

57:56.950 --> 57:58.668
I'll have to help him.

57:59.630 --> 58:01.427
All right, you better wear this.

58:02.630 --> 58:04.541
- How's the nitrogen?
- Almost there.

58:08.150 --> 58:11.620
What he's doing is spraying
this thing with liquid nitrogen...

58:11.830 --> 58:14.503
...to give you a second
or two before detonation.

58:14.710 --> 58:17.304
- Got that?
- A second or two. Thanks a lot.

58:17.870 --> 58:18.905
Lights out!

58:19.110 --> 58:20.623
Get him up and out.

58:24.230 --> 58:25.822
- Let's go.
- Move!

58:28.670 --> 58:29.898
Good luck.

58:30.670 --> 58:31.989
You got a piece?

58:32.190 --> 58:33.942
- A Smith & Wesson.
- Try this.

58:34.150 --> 58:36.266
Safety's on. I'll collect it later.

58:38.110 --> 58:39.543
Good luck.

58:42.910 --> 58:44.309
All right, let's move.

58:53.270 --> 58:54.783
Alone at last.

58:55.870 --> 58:58.907
Why didn't they plant
the bomb in Trish's stove?

58:59.110 --> 59:02.341
Think of all the needless suffering
that could have ended.

59:15.110 --> 59:17.180
I'm gonna die on the toilet.

59:17.390 --> 59:19.779
Guys like you don't die on toilets.

59:19.990 --> 59:22.868
Anyway, I'm here, and I don't
plan on going just now.

59:25.070 --> 59:26.389
Let's do it.

59:32.790 --> 59:33.779
On "three."

59:33.990 --> 59:36.265
Wait, let me get into the tub.

59:36.710 --> 59:38.621
I'm just gonna give you the...

59:39.190 --> 59:41.306
On "three," huh? What do you say?

59:43.710 --> 59:44.825
One...

59:45.790 --> 59:47.701
...two...
- Wait!

59:49.790 --> 59:52.304
Do we do it on "three"...

59:52.750 --> 59:54.581
...or "one, two, three"...

59:54.790 --> 59:57.065
...then do it?
- Well, it's your ass.

59:57.270 --> 59:58.305
It's up to you.

59:59.590 --> 01:00:00.864
My ass, yeah.

01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:02.259
"Three."

01:00:02.590 --> 01:00:03.989
We go on "three"?

01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:06.499
"One, two" and then "three"!

01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:10.899
One...

01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:12.549
- Martin?
- What?

01:00:19.110 --> 01:00:20.179
I know.

01:00:21.310 --> 01:00:22.823
I mean it, man.

01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:26.944
I hear you.

01:00:29.550 --> 01:00:31.780
We're not gonna fucking die,
all right?

01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:34.065
On "three."

01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:36.184
One...

01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:37.979
...two...

01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:39.459
...three!

01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:50.109
I gotta go! I gotta go!

01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:10.741
Get off me. I don't want
anybody to see us like this.

01:01:14.590 --> 01:01:15.864
Mr. Jones?

01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:18.581
Sit down, please.

01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:23.146
What can I do for you today?

01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:26.069
I have this problem,
this very delicate matter.

01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:28.784
My friend wants to emigrate
to South Africa.

01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:31.185
Of course, I can help him do that.

01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:33.745
I want you to talk him out of it.

01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:35.585
Talk him out of it?

01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:37.309
Whatever for?

01:01:37.790 --> 01:01:41.624
This is a bad time for him to go.
I mean, with all the trouble.

01:01:41.830 --> 01:01:44.663
Ask your friend to come back
later in the week...

01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:46.940
...we can sit down...
- No, he's here.

01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:48.424
- He's here?
- He's here now.

01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:49.540
Alphonse!

01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:50.865
Alphonse?

01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:59.218
How you doing?

01:01:59.430 --> 01:02:01.261
There must be some mistake.

01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:04.784
Say what?

01:02:07.070 --> 01:02:10.426
Listen to your friend.
He knows what he's talking about.

01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:13.389
I don't think you want
to go to South Africa.

01:02:13.590 --> 01:02:14.625
Why not?

01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:18.944
Because you're black.

01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:23.065
You are.

01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:24.704
He is.

01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:28.068
Of course I'm black.
That's why I want to go.

01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:31.140
To join my brothers in the struggle...

01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:34.023
...against the tyranny
of the racist, fascist...

01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:35.504
...white, minority regime!

01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:36.745
Fascist regime!

01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:37.985
One man, one vote!

01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:39.100
One man, one vote!

01:02:39.310 --> 01:02:41.460
Free South Africa, you son of a bitch!

01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:42.898
You son of a bitch!

01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:46.261
I've heard as much as I want to.
I demand that you leave.

01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:49.862
What's happening here?

01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:52.069
Back off!

01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:57.979
Close the security gate! Quickly!

01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:12.308
End apartheid now!

01:03:13.550 --> 01:03:16.542
You're telling me to shut up?
You gonna arrest me?

01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:36.778
You can't push me out!

01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:39.582
You call this security?

01:04:39.790 --> 01:04:43.749
More people come in and out of here
than Grand Central Station.

01:04:46.790 --> 01:04:47.779
Wait, gentlemen!

01:04:48.790 --> 01:04:51.463
Don't bother to call the police.
I'm here already.

01:04:52.910 --> 01:04:54.628
I should have known.

01:04:57.030 --> 01:04:58.429
Well, well.

01:04:59.070 --> 01:05:01.300
It's the master race!

01:05:02.350 --> 01:05:05.148
I hope you realize the trouble
you are in right now.

01:05:05.710 --> 01:05:09.100
As usual, you have everything
upside down and turned around...

01:05:09.310 --> 01:05:10.629
...and back to front.

01:05:10.830 --> 01:05:12.183
Gentlemen...

01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:15.065
...show Officer Riggs into the street.

01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:21.259
Fingers off.

01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:22.698
Hand off!

01:05:23.790 --> 01:05:25.781
Let me look at that.

01:05:28.030 --> 01:05:31.705
That's some piece of hardware.
Where the fuck do you get that stuff?

01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:34.743
I've never seen that.
Where's it from? South Africa?

01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:37.938
Don't move.

01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:47.586
I'm surprised you haven't heard
about me. I got a bad reputation.

01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:49.588
Sometimes I just go nuts.

01:05:50.790 --> 01:05:51.984
Don't move.

01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:59.149
I'll make a deal with you, Arjen.
Or is it Aryan?

01:05:59.350 --> 01:06:01.420
Whatever the fuck your name is.

01:06:02.110 --> 01:06:06.262
You fold up your tents, and get
the fuck out of my country...

01:06:06.790 --> 01:06:08.621
...and I won't do anything to you.

01:06:09.150 --> 01:06:10.742
I'll leave you alone.

01:06:11.030 --> 01:06:14.102
If you stick around here,
I'm gonna fuck your ass.

01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:17.782
Then I'll send you home
with your balls in a sling.

01:06:18.990 --> 01:06:21.106
Just get out of here...

01:06:21.630 --> 01:06:23.541
<i>... kaffir lover.</i>

01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:30.825
Eenie...

01:06:31.310 --> 01:06:32.265
...meenie...

01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:34.264
...minie...

01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:36.659
Hey, Moe!

01:06:40.590 --> 01:06:41.989
Sorry, Adolf.

01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:46.181
Pick them up with your hands.

01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:49.102
Big smile.

01:06:49.310 --> 01:06:50.663
Big smile!

01:06:52.830 --> 01:06:55.025
Vorstedt, come over here!

01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:56.379
Vorstedt!

01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:03.024
- Hello. Officer...?
- Martin Riggs.

01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:04.709
What are you doing here?

01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:08.061
I've been with your boss.
You know, shooting the breeze.

01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:09.828
Shooting his fish.

01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:24.548
The guy goes, "But, but, but...

01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:26.149
...you're black!"

01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:30.309
He's black!

01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:33.588
- I bet he was shitting.
- Started some shit with that!

01:07:33.790 --> 01:07:35.303
You get into Rudd's office?

01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:36.829
Yeah, I got up there.

01:07:37.030 --> 01:07:39.669
Aryan Crud and his
Brown Shirts turned up...

01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:42.179
...but I ripped this off a pad.
What's that?

01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:45.700
- "Alba Varden, Thursday."
- What do you think?

01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:47.548
Is that Hitler's girlfriend?

01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:48.819
That's Eva Braun.

01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:50.827
He has a date with her Thursday.

01:07:51.070 --> 01:07:52.549
Her name sounds familiar.

01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:55.344
- You know her?
- No. It just sounds familiar.

01:07:55.590 --> 01:07:57.182
Alba Varden...

01:07:57.390 --> 01:08:00.302
There's a deli. Pull over.
Let's eat, I'm starving.

01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:01.619
I'll spring.

01:08:01.830 --> 01:08:03.582
Let's go. Sounds good to me.

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:10.701
- Out the other side.
- Other door, Leo.

01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:11.979
Out the other door.

01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:13.066
No cars.

01:08:28.189 --> 01:08:29.509
Vorstedt!

01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:34.988
That policeman.

01:08:45.670 --> 01:08:47.421
You should pick from the bottom.

01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:49.461
They put the old stock on top.

01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:50.658
Officer Riggs.

01:08:52.710 --> 01:08:54.666
I followed you from the consulate.

01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:55.939
You followed me?

01:08:56.149 --> 01:09:00.029
Well, I needed some pork chops
and a toilet brush too.

01:09:02.109 --> 01:09:03.747
I wanted to apologize...

01:09:04.029 --> 01:09:06.783
...for the other day,
in case we frightened you.

01:09:06.990 --> 01:09:09.823
I was a bit startled
by all those guns.

01:09:10.189 --> 01:09:13.023
I'm sorry.
And I wanted to thank you too.

01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:15.502
Thank me for what?

01:09:19.950 --> 01:09:22.669
You don't like your boss
very much, do you?

01:09:23.310 --> 01:09:26.426
There's a lot I don't like
about my boss and my country.

01:09:27.390 --> 01:09:29.062
But I like my job very much.

01:09:29.270 --> 01:09:31.386
It keeps me here in Los Angeles.

01:09:31.630 --> 01:09:32.665
You like this town?

01:09:34.310 --> 01:09:35.379
That's a new one.

01:09:36.670 --> 01:09:39.389
- I forgot your first name.
- It's Rika.

01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:41.023
Rika Van Häagen-Dazs.

01:09:41.229 --> 01:09:43.983
- Ice cream?
- No, Van Den Haas. It's Dutch.

01:09:44.189 --> 01:09:45.747
That's a real pretty name.

01:09:49.950 --> 01:09:52.703
- Got a rabbit or is that your dinner?
- It's mine.

01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:54.229
Shop one day at a time?

01:09:54.430 --> 01:09:55.943
Good police work.

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:58.061
I get paid for that.

01:09:58.270 --> 01:10:00.147
I don't shop for the entire week.

01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:01.499
No? Why not?

01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:05.029
I never know what I'll be hungry for.

01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:08.786
Wait. Have dinner with me.

01:10:10.110 --> 01:10:14.581
I got a nice place on the beach.
A good view from every window.

01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:16.109
A beautiful sunset.

01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:19.586
Come on, be original, say yes.
Everyone else says no.

01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:21.826
Come to my place.
I'm a gourmet cook.

01:10:22.190 --> 01:10:23.418
Let go of the basket.

01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:24.540
I'll scream.

01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:25.660
- Don't.
- I will.

01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:26.746
Please...

01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:29.942
I'll embarrass you.
You'll turn red like that apple.

01:10:30.150 --> 01:10:32.186
- Come on with me.
- No. No, please.

01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:36.145
Lady, let go of my bag!
Hey, look! Somebody call a cop!

01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:39.023
What are you doing?

01:10:39.230 --> 01:10:41.460
Let's go before someone calls a cop.

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:43.069
You are a cop.

01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:53.705
You must be an honest
cop, Martin Riggs.

01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:58.665
It ain't much, but it's everything
I said. Look at the view.

01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:03.105
I did exaggerate about one thing.

01:11:03.310 --> 01:11:06.541
I'm not exactly a gourmet cook.
I can only make chili.

01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:10.026
- Do you like it with or without Oreos?
- With, of course.

01:11:10.230 --> 01:11:11.868
A woman after my own heart.

01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:13.783
Careful. Watch your step.

01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:15.545
Sam wants in.

01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:16.739
Here, sit down.

01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:18.269
Wait a minute.

01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:20.269
It's a little filthy.

01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:31.660
I haven't got wine. How about a beer?

01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:32.859
That's fine.

01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:35.025
She drinks beer.

01:11:51.230 --> 01:11:53.664
What's wrong? You got a dirty glass?

01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:57.300
Oh, it's a wedding ring.

01:11:58.750 --> 01:12:00.183
I used to be married.

01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:01.379
But not anymore?

01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:04.862
No. Not anymore.

01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:10.584
I got something on the stove.

01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:16.748
Is Rudd hiding behind
his diplomatic credentials?

01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:18.178
What's that?

01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:21.788
Rudd's hiding behind
his diplomatic credentials.

01:12:23.390 --> 01:12:24.823
He's not a very nice guy.

01:12:27.150 --> 01:12:30.779
Then whatever he's doing,
he shouldn't get away with it.

01:12:38.830 --> 01:12:40.263
How's it hanging, Wyler?

01:12:40.510 --> 01:12:43.422
- What the hell do you want?
- I hope better than Murtaugh.

01:12:43.670 --> 01:12:45.262
Easy. Easy.

01:12:45.670 --> 01:12:49.299
Tell me, have your brains
ever seen the light of day?

01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:52.303
Who are you?
What do you want? I'm a cop!

01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:53.869
No, you were a cop.

01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:55.903
Honey, we're gonna be late.

01:12:56.110 --> 01:13:00.023
I'm just gonna take a couple laps
before I go down to the station.

01:13:51.790 --> 01:13:55.066
<i>Sam, take a hike.
No Stooges tonight. Go on!</i>

01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:59.308
He's sweet.

01:14:16.590 --> 01:14:17.579
Get a beer, man.

01:14:17.790 --> 01:14:18.984
Don't worry about it.

01:14:19.230 --> 01:14:21.141
Cavanaugh, are you in or out?

01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:22.659
I'm out.

01:14:23.070 --> 01:14:24.503
Put some music on.

01:14:33.150 --> 01:14:36.460
- Who's not accounted for?
- Riggs and Murtaugh.

01:14:36.670 --> 01:14:39.628
Murtaugh's taking the witness
to a new location.

01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:41.866
- What about Riggs?
- Hasn't checked in.

01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:43.947
Get on the radio and find them!

01:14:44.190 --> 01:14:48.103
We lost Wyler, Collins, Cavanaugh.
How many do we have to lose?

01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:51.985
Let's worry about the ones
that are alive, all right? Do it.

01:14:52.590 --> 01:14:54.069
Sorry, captain.

01:15:00.510 --> 01:15:01.909
Get me Riggs.

01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:10.189
I'll get that.

01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:29.346
Thanks to you, I missed my poker game.
And I was feeling real lucky.

01:15:30.230 --> 01:15:34.303
Okay. So what I see are nice
conservative tax returns.

01:15:34.510 --> 01:15:37.582
Everything by the book.
Everything black and white.

01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:40.264
You have to play around
in the gray areas...

01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:42.421
...if you want to see some bucks.

01:15:42.630 --> 01:15:45.986
Your salary's not much to work with.
You need deductions.

01:15:46.190 --> 01:15:47.589
- My boat.
- Can't deduct it.

01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:51.539
- No, it's the bill of sale.
- I know, but you can't deduct it.

01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:53.582
That's it, my boat! Let's go!

01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:55.058
- Go where?
- To my house.

01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:56.942
- For what?
- My boat, man.

01:15:57.150 --> 01:15:58.868
Look at this commercial!

01:15:59.070 --> 01:16:02.062
Look at the body on this kid.
She is so hot.

01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:04.465
What are you doing?
Look at the girl!

01:16:04.670 --> 01:16:06.467
You hit the button...

01:16:06.670 --> 01:16:09.901
- I didn't hear you say that.
- Say what? She's great.

01:16:10.110 --> 01:16:12.908
She has a great body.
Makes me want to buy rubbers.

01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:24.139
It's time for the
seventh-inning stretch.

01:16:28.190 --> 01:16:29.942
That's a baseball expression.

01:16:30.150 --> 01:16:31.663
I know.

01:16:32.270 --> 01:16:34.704
But we're only up
to the fourth inning.

01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:41.069
Batter up!

01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:51.588
Stay in the car.

01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:54.306
I'll only be a minute, okay?

01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:57.868
I don't want to stay.
It's cold. You have no door.

01:16:58.070 --> 01:17:01.745
You're the reason there's no door.
Turn on the heat if you're cold.

01:17:04.590 --> 01:17:05.989
Don't touch anything.

01:17:06.190 --> 01:17:08.181
Nothing. I mean nothing!

01:17:11.150 --> 01:17:12.902
Alba Varden...

01:17:13.230 --> 01:17:14.868
Why do I know the name?

01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:17.026
It's here. It's gotta be.

01:17:17.670 --> 01:17:21.185
<i>- Another day, another hobby.
- Yeah, what's new?</i>

01:17:27.190 --> 01:17:28.418
The day on my boat.

01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:32.821
Not there. Where is it?

01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:34.743
My birthday.

01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:03.668
I'll be damned.

01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:07.869
<i>Alba Varden is a ship, not a woman.</i>

01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:10.186
Leo, I told you to stay in the car.

01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:11.819
Shit!

01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:16.820
Son of a bitch,
what are you doing here?

01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:16.303
Nailed them both.

01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:30.783
My car.

01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:34.829
Leo!

01:20:30.670 --> 01:20:32.183
Get up, get dressed.

01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:33.379
What is it?

01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:35.262
Get dressed. Trust me.

01:20:39.390 --> 01:20:41.028
- I don't understand.
- Trust me.

01:20:41.230 --> 01:20:43.505
Something's wrong.
I got a bad feeling.

01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:45.786
- I don't understand.
- Put this on.

01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:50.303
Get in the truck.
The keys are under the seat.

01:21:50.510 --> 01:21:53.308
When they stop to reload,
run for the truck.

01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:55.466
- What about you?
- I'll be okay.

01:21:55.670 --> 01:21:57.865
I'll meet you in the truck. Go on!

01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:59.503
Stay out of the light.

01:22:44.590 --> 01:22:46.262
Master race.

01:23:07.310 --> 01:23:08.345
It's all right.

01:23:13.230 --> 01:23:15.585
You shit! You shit!

01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:19.220
- Who were those people?
- You tell me. Was it your husband?

01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:21.068
What are you doing Saturday?

01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:32.624
It's Sam!

01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:37.708
Get your head down!

01:23:54.350 --> 01:23:55.339
Come on, Sam!

01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:57.149
Come on, Sam!

01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:58.465
Come on, Sam.

01:23:59.150 --> 01:24:00.629
- Shake a leg.
- Come on, boy.

01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:07.067
Has he got any holes in him?

01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:11.181
You clever dog!

01:24:18.110 --> 01:24:20.749
I promised I'd have you home by 11:00.

01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:23.623
This is the most
incredible first date.

01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:25.627
Wait until the second.

01:24:25.870 --> 01:24:29.067
- No more helicopters, please.
- Okay, I promise.

01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:31.980
This is a nice building
you've got here.

01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:34.865
Any vacancies? I'm between homes.

01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:36.788
You can stay right here.

01:24:37.790 --> 01:24:38.620
I can?

01:24:38.830 --> 01:24:41.298
Yes, there's a vacant
apartment up there.

01:24:44.150 --> 01:24:46.823
I was kidding. You can stay with me.

01:24:47.230 --> 01:24:48.265
Tonight?

01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:52.099
Yes. Tonight and tomorrow night
and the night after that.

01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:53.260
And after that?

01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:56.267
Don't push your luck.

01:25:02.590 --> 01:25:04.262
I gotta go.

01:25:04.510 --> 01:25:08.059
- But you said...
- Go inside and lock all the doors.

01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:10.784
And you're not going to work tomorrow.

01:25:10.990 --> 01:25:14.027
There's better ways of staying
in L.A. Than that job.

01:25:14.230 --> 01:25:16.425
All right. I've just quit.

01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:44.582
I'll just grab a few things...
I forgot, I haven't got anything.

01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:46.826
Just bring yourself.

01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:50.743
I gotta go.

01:25:51.150 --> 01:25:52.469
Bye.

01:26:08.110 --> 01:26:09.259
Go home!

01:26:09.550 --> 01:26:10.778
Go!

01:26:23.630 --> 01:26:25.143
Go get the girl.

01:26:45.550 --> 01:26:48.826
I was going to offer you a drink,
but I understand...

01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:50.304
...you're on the wagon.

01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:52.307
That stuff will kill you quick.

01:26:52.510 --> 01:26:55.263
You know so much about me,
who the hell are you?

01:26:59.510 --> 01:27:02.149
I'm the guy that changed
the course of your life.

01:27:03.070 --> 01:27:04.662
Four years ago...

01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:07.219
...when you was a narc
down at Long Beach...

01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:10.581
...you were getting too close.
We put a contract on you.

01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:12.587
I handled it myself.

01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:15.298
Drove your car off the road, remember?

01:27:15.870 --> 01:27:18.020
But you weren't driving, were you?

01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:21.544
You can't imagine the surprise.

01:27:21.750 --> 01:27:26.460
I pulled back this matted mop of
bloody hair to see this woman's face.

01:27:28.030 --> 01:27:29.258
Your wife, right?

01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:33.546
She didn't die straight away.

01:27:35.230 --> 01:27:36.948
It took a bit of time.

01:27:43.670 --> 01:27:45.786
Don't have much luck
with women, do you?

01:29:53.950 --> 01:29:55.941
<i>She's dead. They killed her.</i>

01:29:56.150 --> 01:29:57.378
Where are you?

01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:59.945
They killed her. She's dead.

01:30:00.150 --> 01:30:01.629
They killed them both.

01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:05.300
Slow down. Who are you
talking about? Where are you?

01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:07.660
<i>She's dead, Roger. She's dead.</i>

01:30:09.310 --> 01:30:12.905
Just calm down. We'll take
care of it. Where are you?

01:30:13.510 --> 01:30:16.900
I'm not a cop tonight.
It's personal. I'm not a cop.

01:30:17.150 --> 01:30:20.028
You don't know what happened tonight.
There's more.

01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:25.467
I'm gonna get those bastards
and fuck them! I'm going there now.

01:30:25.670 --> 01:30:29.948
We're not going to the fucking
stilt house. We're under orders!

01:30:30.150 --> 01:30:32.300
Then the stilt house will come to me.

01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:34.899
You don't understand.
They killed them both.

01:30:35.110 --> 01:30:37.465
<i>- They got Rika and my wife.
- Don't hang up!</i>

01:30:43.230 --> 01:30:44.549
Shit.

01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:58.419
What's the deal?

01:30:59.430 --> 01:31:02.228
You talk to the feds,
but you don't talk to me.

01:31:02.430 --> 01:31:03.465
That's not fair.

01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:08.908
We trusted you, Leo.

01:31:10.830 --> 01:31:11.945
You betrayed us.

01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:14.819
You took our money!

01:31:18.590 --> 01:31:21.866
We want it back now,
you slimy little shit.

01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:26.100
Give him some more.
He seems to like it.

01:31:58.630 --> 01:32:00.621
Don't try and stop me.

01:32:00.830 --> 01:32:03.219
I've seen that look
in your eyes before.

01:32:04.110 --> 01:32:06.783
They declared war on the police.

01:32:07.470 --> 01:32:08.983
You know about that?

01:32:09.230 --> 01:32:11.425
I heard it on the radio.

01:32:12.110 --> 01:32:14.021
We don't have the authority.

01:32:14.270 --> 01:32:15.464
Cavanaugh...

01:32:15.670 --> 01:32:17.581
...Wyler, Shapiro...

01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:22.949
...Rika, Vicki. How much
fucking authority do you need?

01:32:24.670 --> 01:32:26.103
You got a plan?

01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:32.864
If you drive around
the front of the house...

01:32:33.070 --> 01:32:35.106
...you wait for my signal...

01:32:35.790 --> 01:32:38.463
...and then just go in
and shoot those fuckers.

01:32:38.670 --> 01:32:39.659
They got Leo.

01:32:42.030 --> 01:32:43.258
Be careful.

01:32:51.710 --> 01:32:52.699
What's your signal?

01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:56.026
You'll know it when it happens.

01:32:58.670 --> 01:33:01.059
Somehow I think I will know.

01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:33.664
Payday.

01:33:46.910 --> 01:33:48.582
Feel like talking, Leo?

01:33:53.550 --> 01:33:54.665
It's the big one!

01:33:59.070 --> 01:34:00.105
All right. Cool it.

01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:02.619
- Watch him.
- Move me away from the windows!

01:34:34.670 --> 01:34:35.625
Watch the glass!

01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:36.865
- Come on!
- I'll go.

01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:13.065
Riggs, you crazy mother...

01:35:28.990 --> 01:35:30.742
Holy Christ!

01:35:34.710 --> 01:35:35.825
You all right?

01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:37.059
I'm okay.

01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:38.305
Thanks.

01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:41.420
- Was Adolf in there?
- He got away.

01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:44.227
- I'm gonna find him.
- What about Leo?

01:35:44.430 --> 01:35:45.499
What about Leo?

01:35:45.710 --> 01:35:47.587
You're on your own now, Leo.

01:35:47.790 --> 01:35:49.189
What do you mean?

01:35:49.390 --> 01:35:52.700
Take my car to the station
and wait for the federal marshal.

01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:55.060
It's been an experience knowing you.

01:35:59.230 --> 01:36:02.108
- I don't want a hug.
- Give the little fellow a hug.

01:36:02.350 --> 01:36:04.102
I had a lot of fun.

01:36:04.710 --> 01:36:06.348
You do your duty now.

01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:08.745
Don't worry.
I'll really get them now.

01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:11.259
- Listen! Wait!
- You know how to find him.

01:36:11.470 --> 01:36:13.461
Is it okay if I sound the siren?

01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:17.104
Loud as you want.

01:36:17.350 --> 01:36:18.339
Really?

01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:20.745
- Okay. Really?
- Bye, Leo.

01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:26.584
<i>Check it out.</i>

01:36:26.910 --> 01:36:30.266
<i>The Alba Varden is
a cargo ship, not a woman.</i>

01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:33.826
<i>The Port Authority said that
the Alba Varden arrived today...</i>

01:36:34.030 --> 01:36:36.783
<i>... and heads out tomorrow
to South Africa.</i>

01:36:38.790 --> 01:36:40.621
This is the 11 th dock.

01:36:40.830 --> 01:36:43.708
It must be here someplace.
I know I'm right.

01:36:48.750 --> 01:36:49.626
The ship.

01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:51.263
What did I tell you?

01:36:52.990 --> 01:36:55.629
That container there,
with three heavy hitters.

01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:56.899
Let's have a look.

01:36:58.670 --> 01:37:00.900
I'll take two of them out.
You take one.

01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:06.338
Better yet, you take two,
I'll take one. Pull over.

01:37:51.870 --> 01:37:52.939
I can't see shit.

01:37:53.150 --> 01:37:54.947
Me either. What is this shit?

01:37:55.150 --> 01:37:56.629
Got a light?

01:37:58.150 --> 01:38:00.186
It's gotta be Rudd's, whatever it is.

01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:02.506
I still can't see shit.

01:38:04.270 --> 01:38:07.467
- You got something?
- I don't know. It's a car.

01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:14.779
Holy shit. Fort Kno x!

01:38:17.910 --> 01:38:19.821
Hell, how much is it?

01:38:21.430 --> 01:38:22.863
Thousands.

01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:26.227
Fucking millions!

01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:29.144
Billions!
A fucking Donald Trump lotto!

01:38:38.910 --> 01:38:39.865
Look at this.

01:38:40.590 --> 01:38:42.785
These are thousand-dollar bills.

01:38:44.430 --> 01:38:48.423
With what I'm holding, I could put
all three of my kids through college.

01:38:49.710 --> 01:38:50.699
Take it.

01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:59.423
Fucking drug money.

01:38:59.630 --> 01:39:01.222
Do something good with it.

01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:04.024
Rudd won't need it where he's going.

01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:17.788
Load the container.

01:39:18.030 --> 01:39:21.545
Next time the sun hits their bodies,
they'll be in Cape Town.

01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:28.149
- This thing's moving.
- It sure as hell is.

01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:30.984
- What are we gonna do now?
- I don't know.

01:39:31.510 --> 01:39:32.909
Let's shoot our way out.

01:39:33.110 --> 01:39:35.021
Don't do that. I got a better idea.

01:40:27.390 --> 01:40:28.823
Our money.

01:40:31.710 --> 01:40:33.940
Just make sure they're dead.

01:40:44.270 --> 01:40:47.785
- You go first. I'm too old.
- No, you go first. I'll cover you.

01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:04.620
- How do we get out?
- I'm going this way.

01:41:04.830 --> 01:41:06.980
I'll go this way.
I'll check over here.

01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:25.345
Rog!

01:41:26.470 --> 01:41:27.539
Rog!

01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:22.339
Shit!

01:44:26.270 --> 01:44:27.988
Riggs, you okay?

01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:45.219
Drop it, asshole!

01:44:51.150 --> 01:44:53.710
Diplomatic immunity!

01:45:03.550 --> 01:45:06.018
It's just been revoked.

01:46:20.630 --> 01:46:23.508
You're breathing. You're alive.
You're not dead.

01:46:23.910 --> 01:46:25.343
No, don't die.

01:46:26.630 --> 01:46:29.190
You're not dead until I tell you.

01:46:29.390 --> 01:46:33.178
You got that, Riggs?
You're not dead until I tell you.

01:46:33.390 --> 01:46:34.948
You got that, Riggs?

01:46:35.150 --> 01:46:37.903
You're not dead until I tell you.

01:46:38.150 --> 01:46:40.106
Now breathe with me. Breathe.

01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:41.868
- Now, breathe.
- Hey, Rog.

01:46:46.830 --> 01:46:49.060
Rog, in my pocket.

01:46:56.510 --> 01:46:59.502
I want you to throw those things away.

01:46:59.710 --> 01:47:02.270
Those things will kill you. Really.

01:47:08.030 --> 01:47:09.861
You son of a bitch!

01:47:11.230 --> 01:47:12.583
I thought you were dying.

01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:16.142
I didn't die on your toilet,
I'm not dying in your arms.

01:47:16.350 --> 01:47:17.863
You son of a bitch.

01:47:22.710 --> 01:47:25.986
Are they all gone? The bad guys?
Did you get them?

01:47:26.350 --> 01:47:28.545
<i>They been de-kaffirnated.</i>

01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:39.589
Don't make me laugh! Oh, Jesus.

01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:44.060
Did anyone ever tell you...

01:47:46.150 --> 01:47:48.584
...you really are a beautiful man?

01:47:52.910 --> 01:47:54.741
Give us a kiss before they come.

01:47:56.790 --> 01:47:58.906
Where'd that bullet hit you anyway?

01:48:03.390 --> 01:48:04.903
Don't make me laugh!
