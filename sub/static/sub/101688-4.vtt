00:12.300 --> 00:16.060
300 years ago,
a guild of philosophers

00:16.060 --> 00:19.700
became curious about the bond
between the smallest of atoms.

00:23.980 --> 00:27.580
They forged an instrument, a knife,

00:27.580 --> 00:30.100
that in the hands of
the right person

00:30.100 --> 00:33.260
could cut the very fabric
that joins worlds.

00:35.580 --> 00:38.460
They christened that person
The Bearer.

00:39.700 --> 00:43.420
And the knife they called
The Subtle Knife.

00:49.180 --> 00:52.820
The Guild built a tower in
the city of Cittagazze.

00:58.340 --> 01:02.900
A monument to the knife
which they hid within it.

01:05.180 --> 01:09.700
They kept its powers secret,
but had a choice.

01:09.700 --> 01:13.940
Use this knife for the benefit
of all existence

01:13.940 --> 01:16.580
or just for the benefit
of their own.

01:18.820 --> 01:23.580
They chose badly, stealing trinkets
to fatten their own pockets.

01:26.540 --> 01:30.580
A strange, evil force crept out
from the shadows.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.580
Spectres.

01:38.420 --> 01:42.100
And then came Asriel's great tear
in the sky.

01:43.580 --> 01:47.900
And with it came a mass flood
of Spectres.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.500
A pestilence.

01:52.140 --> 01:55.380
Those that survived fled.

01:59.820 --> 02:05.220
The Subtle Knife was born of hope
but used with greed.

02:07.620 --> 02:09.820
And yet,

02:09.820 --> 02:12.780
in the right hands,

02:12.780 --> 02:15.380
it could still save us all.

03:50.260 --> 03:51.460
How do we get up?

03:54.580 --> 03:56.620
Well, we definitely can't climb
up there.

04:00.220 --> 04:02.820
Come on, let's go
and take a closer look.

04:02.820 --> 04:04.460
We must have missed something.

04:47.540 --> 04:49.540
Lee, we're low on water.

04:51.820 --> 04:53.860
Grumman has to be around here.

05:01.020 --> 05:04.060
You know what they say -
a dead end is a new beginning.

05:07.620 --> 05:10.220
There's something strange here.
Do you feel it too?

05:10.220 --> 05:12.180
Not so much, Hester.

05:12.180 --> 05:15.180
I never wanted to see the sky
so bad in my entire life!

05:15.180 --> 05:16.580
We'll find him soon.

05:17.940 --> 05:21.980
Filthy blood suckers!
Rub some jimson-weed ointment on it!

05:21.980 --> 05:24.020
I'm three inches thick
in jimson-weed.

05:26.740 --> 05:29.620
I want to get out of this swamp.
I want to see the sky.

05:33.540 --> 05:37.300
Lee Scoresby, we thought you'd be
more hare than tortoise.

05:37.300 --> 05:39.300
Hey!

05:39.300 --> 05:41.460
Who is we? Are you a witch's daemon?

05:41.460 --> 05:43.900
You'll see soon enough.
Now try and keep up!

05:46.740 --> 05:48.940
I really hope you have
what I'm looking for!

05:56.460 --> 05:58.700
Nothing's straightforward here.

05:58.700 --> 06:00.900
Well, if he can get in, so can we.

06:10.060 --> 06:12.140
It's like the Jordan crypt
down here.

06:12.140 --> 06:13.420
What can you see?

06:13.420 --> 06:15.100
It looks like
someone's been living here

06:15.100 --> 06:16.740
but I...I can't see an entrance.

06:18.740 --> 06:20.420
Then we have to think wider.

06:20.420 --> 06:22.300
Maybe there's something over here?

06:29.540 --> 06:33.980
This is where we isolate and observe
Shadow Particles or Dark Matter.

06:33.980 --> 06:36.140
We call it The Cave.

06:36.140 --> 06:39.180
So far, my colleague, Dr Malone,
has evidence of low level activity,

06:39.180 --> 06:44.780
but the hope is to record signs of -
dare I say it - conscious behaviour.

06:44.780 --> 06:47.180
If we succeed, we will have
the power to understand

06:47.180 --> 06:50.260
what makes up the very fabric
of the known universe.

06:50.260 --> 06:51.980
Maybe multiple universes.

06:51.980 --> 06:54.260
Yes, it's a little incomprehensible
at first.

06:54.260 --> 06:57.660
And you only have a few days
before they shut you down?

06:57.660 --> 06:58.940
Yes.

06:58.940 --> 07:03.300
Although I'm hoping that you might
be able to help us with that.

07:03.300 --> 07:05.420
On the phone you mentioned
"private interest"?

07:07.420 --> 07:09.540
Please, do come in.

07:09.540 --> 07:13.020
Mary, another all-nighter?
Didn't you get my text?

07:14.100 --> 07:16.420
Sorry, you're... Charles Latrom.

07:16.420 --> 07:18.020
I take it you're Dr Malone?

07:18.020 --> 07:19.620
Er, yeah, sorry.

07:19.620 --> 07:23.340
No, no, no, don't you worry.
I can see you've had a long night.

07:23.340 --> 07:27.060
I've always admired women
with a good work ethic.

07:30.060 --> 07:31.980
Erm, shall we sit down?

07:38.940 --> 07:41.220
I understand from Dr Payne
that you've been making

07:41.220 --> 07:44.460
some fascinating discoveries
in the field of Shadow Matter.

07:44.460 --> 07:46.380
I know you haven't been published,

07:46.380 --> 07:48.940
but I'm here because I'm interested
in funding your work.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.620
You're not serious?

07:52.660 --> 07:54.380
I am very serious.

07:54.380 --> 07:55.420
Sorry, er...

07:56.460 --> 07:59.300
What organisation did you say
you worked for?

07:59.300 --> 08:01.660
You're on the verge of something
ground-breaking...

08:02.860 --> 08:07.300
..something that could take the
theory of Dark Matter's potential

08:07.300 --> 08:10.620
consciousness a great deal further,

08:10.620 --> 08:13.900
and even attract defence funding,

08:13.900 --> 08:17.780
which, as you may know,
is still plentiful

08:17.780 --> 08:22.740
and certainly not subject to those
wearisome application processes.

08:22.740 --> 08:25.100
I think this conversation is over.

08:26.660 --> 08:28.700
Oh, well, I...I think
there's more to discuss.

08:28.700 --> 08:30.900
No, I'd like you to leave, please.

08:44.540 --> 08:46.580
I'll see myself out.

08:46.580 --> 08:50.620
Defence funding?! Seriously,
Oliver, what were you thinking?

08:50.620 --> 08:54.860
I know! We haven't exactly been
inundated with offers.

08:54.860 --> 08:58.500
We need to be realistic. That money
will allow us to continue our work.

08:58.500 --> 09:02.020
We...we have to stop and think.

09:02.020 --> 09:03.700
If you could see what Lyra did,

09:03.700 --> 09:06.100
The Cave was genuinely communicating
with her.

09:06.100 --> 09:07.780
She's special, Oliver.

09:07.780 --> 09:11.740
Where is she then?
You don't have any evidence, Mary.

09:11.740 --> 09:15.180
I'm telling you that
what we're dealing with here is

09:15.180 --> 09:17.660
powerful beyond our comprehension.

09:17.660 --> 09:20.380
We can't let that fall
into the wrong hands.

09:20.380 --> 09:22.020
No, Mary, what we're dealing
with here

09:22.020 --> 09:23.940
is the fact that
you haven't slept in weeks.

09:31.380 --> 09:32.780
It's like a maze down here!

09:33.780 --> 09:36.940
Maybe we're looking for a tunnel
if it's underground?

09:36.940 --> 09:37.980
Lyra.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.580
An angel.

09:45.140 --> 09:46.460
Will!

09:48.420 --> 09:49.460
Will!

09:54.780 --> 09:57.060
What have you found?

09:57.060 --> 10:01.380
It's this door. Look,
it matches the angels on the tower.

10:01.380 --> 10:02.420
Come on.

10:25.020 --> 10:27.340
Care to tell me where we're headed?

10:27.340 --> 10:30.020
I hope there's a bacon sandwich
at the other end!

10:30.020 --> 10:32.100
Oh!

10:57.740 --> 10:58.780
Good.

10:59.980 --> 11:01.420
You're here.

11:01.420 --> 11:02.900
Who are you?

11:02.900 --> 11:05.100
They call me Jopari.

11:05.100 --> 11:06.780
But I've had a few names in my time.

11:06.780 --> 11:10.500
Well, I'm looking
for a Doctor Stanislaus Grumman -
is that one of them?

11:10.500 --> 11:12.460
It is, yes.

11:12.460 --> 11:15.140
But call me Jopari for now.

11:15.140 --> 11:18.140
Mr Jopari, my name's Lee Scoresby.

11:18.140 --> 11:20.380
I'm from the country of Texas.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.860
You're a long way from home,
Mr Scoresby.

11:22.860 --> 11:26.900
Well, there are strange winds
blowing through the world now, sir.

11:26.900 --> 11:28.940
Do you like soup?

11:28.940 --> 11:30.740
Maybe a bacon sandwich?

11:34.060 --> 11:38.140
Mr Jopari, I've come here humbly
to ask for your help.

11:38.140 --> 11:40.740
I have reason to believe you're
in possession of an item that

11:40.740 --> 11:42.660
confers protection on anyone
who holds it...

11:42.660 --> 11:45.100
You're wrong, Mr Scoresby,
you didn't come to me.

11:45.100 --> 11:46.820
I summoned you.

11:46.820 --> 11:49.580
Yeah, I beg your pardon.
I've risked life and limb

11:49.580 --> 11:52.860
and my perfect complexion through
swamps and snow to get here.

11:52.860 --> 11:54.820
You didn't summon me! Here.

12:01.260 --> 12:02.860
This was my mother's.

12:02.860 --> 12:04.380
It brought you here.

12:04.380 --> 12:08.340
I...I haven't seen this
for 20 years. I don't understand.

12:08.340 --> 12:10.900
You've travelled a long way.
You must be hungry.

12:10.900 --> 12:12.340
Who the hell do you think you are?

12:12.340 --> 12:15.420
Sit down, Mr Scoresby,
and I'll tell you.

12:35.140 --> 12:37.180
Who do you think owns this place?

12:38.860 --> 12:41.140
They're a group called The Guild.

12:42.740 --> 12:44.700
Angelica told me about them.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.420
Stay close, Pan.

12:51.420 --> 12:52.820
You're not scared, are you?

12:52.820 --> 12:54.580
Pan! OK!

13:04.980 --> 13:08.180
I'll go first. No. I'll go first...

13:08.180 --> 13:10.020
..seeing as all this is my fault.

13:10.020 --> 13:12.580
Seeing as it's your fault,
you've got to do as I say.

13:55.940 --> 14:00.220
Centuries ago, some pig-headed
philosophers invented a tool...

14:01.220 --> 14:02.780
..for their own undoing.

14:03.940 --> 14:08.420
A Subtle Knife,
also known as Esahaettr.

14:08.420 --> 14:12.580
This knife could cut not just flesh,
but spirit.

14:12.580 --> 14:17.500
It could slice between worlds,
it could kill immortals.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.380
You have this knife, do you?

14:20.420 --> 14:21.980
No.

14:21.980 --> 14:24.700
But I want to find
the person who does.

14:24.700 --> 14:27.340
I believe a new bearer
of the Subtle Knife is

14:27.340 --> 14:29.380
soon to take up the mantle.

14:29.380 --> 14:32.620
We need to find them and take them
to Lord Asriel.

14:34.460 --> 14:35.860
Asriel.

14:35.860 --> 14:37.140
You know him?

14:38.340 --> 14:41.180
I don't like Asriel. Like him?

14:41.180 --> 14:44.020
Who does? This is much, much bigger
than that.

14:45.060 --> 14:47.380
Don't confuse the man
with the mission.

14:49.420 --> 14:53.500
Mr Scoresby, there are two forces
that have always been at war

14:53.500 --> 14:56.140
with each other -
those who repress, who command,

14:56.140 --> 14:59.300
who don't want us to be conscious,
enquiring beings,

14:59.300 --> 15:01.700
and those who want us to know more,

15:01.700 --> 15:04.380
to be stronger and wiser,
to explore.

15:04.380 --> 15:07.860
And those two forces are lining up
to battle as we speak.

15:07.860 --> 15:10.980
And if the right side has any chance
of success,

15:10.980 --> 15:13.220
Asriel will need the knife.

15:13.220 --> 15:15.100
That may well be,

15:15.100 --> 15:18.860
but I come here for one reason
and that's a girl named Lyra,

15:18.860 --> 15:20.780
not to help her father.

15:20.780 --> 15:23.140
She's the best person I know
and she's in danger.

15:23.140 --> 15:26.420
If you don't have the knife and you
can't help her, I'll be on my way.

15:26.420 --> 15:27.900
You love this girl?

15:27.900 --> 15:30.740
Yes, more than Asriel.

15:30.740 --> 15:33.540
He just left her
to fend for herself.

15:33.540 --> 15:36.460
Imagine, leaving your kid like that.

15:38.420 --> 15:41.060
I never had a daughter.
I haven't been that lucky.

15:42.660 --> 15:48.380
But if I did, I hope she'd be
half as strong and brave and good.

15:52.580 --> 15:53.700
I did.

15:56.820 --> 15:59.020
You did what?

15:59.020 --> 16:00.580
I left my boy.

16:03.820 --> 16:05.100
My son.

16:13.260 --> 16:14.700
He's hurt!

16:16.620 --> 16:17.900
Who are you?

16:17.900 --> 16:21.420
My name is Giacomo Paradisi.
I am The Bearer.

16:21.420 --> 16:23.700
The Bearer? There's a boy
hiding in this tower.

16:23.700 --> 16:25.140
He stole the knife from me!

16:25.140 --> 16:26.940
Quick, help me with these.

16:35.260 --> 16:36.420
The knife.

16:37.460 --> 16:40.540
Who are you? Why are you here?
What do you want?

16:40.540 --> 16:43.140
Look, we need that knife.
Careful, Lyra.

16:43.140 --> 16:44.900
It's OK. Just, just calm down.

16:44.900 --> 16:46.940
No, it's mine! Get out!

16:59.460 --> 17:00.740
Will!

17:07.060 --> 17:08.460
Lyra, help him!

17:49.700 --> 17:51.060
I've got the knife!

17:55.060 --> 17:56.300
Don't touch him!

18:09.420 --> 18:11.940
Fight! Fight boy! Fight!

18:26.740 --> 18:29.700
You! You get out of here
while you still can!

18:41.860 --> 18:43.380
Your fingers.

18:48.420 --> 18:50.460
Will?

18:50.460 --> 18:53.420
Will? I think he's waking up.

18:54.820 --> 18:56.060
You're back!

19:03.300 --> 19:04.620
Where am I?

19:04.620 --> 19:06.260
We're in Giacomo's quarters.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.420
Drink it all.

19:11.340 --> 19:12.580
What is it?

19:12.580 --> 19:13.980
Plum brandy.

19:13.980 --> 19:15.780
It'll help with the shock.

19:17.580 --> 19:20.420
I know neither of you
are of this world.

19:20.420 --> 19:23.780
I have encountered daemons before.

19:23.780 --> 19:25.220
We don't have long.

19:25.220 --> 19:27.660
I need you to concentrate now.

19:27.660 --> 19:29.780
Concentrate on what?

19:29.780 --> 19:32.980
The knife knows
when to leave one hand

19:32.980 --> 19:35.060
and settle on another.

19:35.060 --> 19:38.140
It's the cleanest cut
in all the universes.

19:42.180 --> 19:45.660
I fought and lost the same fingers.

19:45.660 --> 19:49.540
I don't know who you are,
or where you're from but...

19:49.540 --> 19:55.060
..Will, you are The Bearer
of the Subtle Knife.

20:00.700 --> 20:05.260
I stepped out of my world
many years ago and left them behind.

20:05.260 --> 20:07.380
My wife.

20:07.380 --> 20:09.260
My son.

20:13.380 --> 20:16.620
I thought my work was
more important.

20:16.620 --> 20:17.740
Such a fool.

20:19.460 --> 20:21.460
For years I tried to get back
to them,

20:21.460 --> 20:23.860
but the way I came had disappeared.

20:23.860 --> 20:28.700
Then I became a scholar
and a shaman to find a way,

20:28.700 --> 20:31.100
but it seems my world is
closed from me.

20:31.100 --> 20:34.860
But there were other doorways,
other discoveries to be made.

20:34.860 --> 20:39.340
Imagine my astonishment to learn
that part of my nature is female.

20:39.340 --> 20:40.900
Bird-formed.

20:40.900 --> 20:42.260
Beautiful.

20:44.620 --> 20:45.940
So you've given up?

20:49.300 --> 20:52.820
Not given up.
Just made peace with my limitations.

20:54.020 --> 20:57.140
If I want to be a father
that's good, proper now,

20:57.140 --> 20:59.780
I need to leave a world
behind me for him,

20:59.780 --> 21:02.940
where he's able to think
for himself.

21:04.940 --> 21:06.500
Where he's free.

21:10.780 --> 21:12.540
That's why I need to help Asriel.

21:13.700 --> 21:15.980
You make a very good argument,
Mr Jopari.

21:18.940 --> 21:20.660
How about we make a deal?

21:20.660 --> 21:25.100
You swear to put Lyra under the
protection of that Subtle Knife...

21:27.060 --> 21:29.660
..I'll take you
wherever you need to go.

21:29.660 --> 21:32.980
I swear, by the love you have
for your boy.

21:34.980 --> 21:36.380
I'll gladly do that.

21:37.660 --> 21:38.820
You have my word.

21:39.900 --> 21:42.740
Lyra will be under
the protection of the knife.

21:42.740 --> 21:45.700
But you must know, Mr Scoresby,

21:45.700 --> 21:49.100
The Bearer of the knife
will have their own task

21:49.100 --> 21:51.660
and that could put Lyra
in even greater danger.

21:53.180 --> 21:55.060
I can only be guided to them.

21:56.020 --> 21:58.260
I cannot speak for
The Bearer's character.

22:08.220 --> 22:10.820
There are two sides
to the Subtle Knife.

22:12.900 --> 22:16.660
This edge will cut through
any material in the world.

22:16.660 --> 22:19.580
It will even ward off
and kill Spectres.

22:19.580 --> 22:22.420
I've seen that colour before.

22:22.420 --> 22:24.740
It looks like the one at Bolvangar.

22:24.740 --> 22:27.700
Like the blade that tried to
cut me and Pan apart!

22:27.700 --> 22:31.180
The other edge is more subtle still.

22:31.180 --> 22:35.740
With it, you can cut an opening
out of this world altogether.

22:37.780 --> 22:40.340
This is a great burden
for one so young,

22:40.340 --> 22:43.860
but the knife, the Esahaettr,
has chosen you.

22:52.660 --> 22:59.620
Now, it's not only the knife that
has to cut, it's your own mind.

22:59.620 --> 23:04.100
So put your mind
at the very tip of the knife.

23:04.100 --> 23:06.940
Concentrate, boy.

23:06.940 --> 23:09.060
You're looking for a small gap.

23:11.060 --> 23:12.660
It's almost invisible,

23:12.660 --> 23:17.140
but the knife tip will find it
if you put your mind there.

23:19.420 --> 23:23.740
Stand steady until you see
the smallest gap appear.

23:28.020 --> 23:29.940
You're not clearing your mind.

23:31.140 --> 23:33.100
I'm sorry, I can't.

23:38.140 --> 23:39.860
Will, you can do this.

23:46.820 --> 23:48.420
Pan!

23:48.420 --> 23:50.100
Did I do something wrong?

23:51.740 --> 23:53.180
No. No.

23:57.140 --> 24:01.260
In my world you're not supposed to
touch someone else's daemon,

24:01.260 --> 24:03.620
but you didn't do something wrong.

24:03.620 --> 24:06.580
It was me, Will, I wanted to.

24:06.580 --> 24:08.220
He wanted to help.

24:14.780 --> 24:17.340
I was trying to read
the Alethiometer

24:17.340 --> 24:19.260
when I was frightened once.

24:19.260 --> 24:21.420
And I couldn't shut the fear out,

24:21.420 --> 24:23.540
just like you can't shut
the pain out.

24:25.620 --> 24:27.620
So I had to accept it.

24:27.620 --> 24:30.660
That's what you've got to do,
you've got to say,

24:30.660 --> 24:32.660
"I know it hurts...

24:34.420 --> 24:37.100
"..but right now the most important
thing is the knife."

24:44.260 --> 24:45.300
OK.

24:46.340 --> 24:47.900
Right.

24:47.900 --> 24:49.220
Let's do this.

24:52.860 --> 24:56.980
Good. Now look at me and focus.

25:17.060 --> 25:21.180
Ruta, I'm so sorry. Your lands.
Lake Lubana?

25:21.180 --> 25:22.980
They destroyed everything.

25:22.980 --> 25:26.220
We summoned the rains to put
the fire out, but it was too late.

25:26.220 --> 25:28.420
Hundreds of witches are dead,

25:28.420 --> 25:30.380
and it is on my conscience.

25:30.380 --> 25:32.500
Don't allow this to consume you.

25:32.500 --> 25:34.380
It is done.

25:34.380 --> 25:35.940
And my anger now is for them.

25:35.940 --> 25:39.500
And I will need
Queen Ruta Skadi for what's next.

25:39.500 --> 25:41.420
Kaisa spoke with the Bear King.

25:41.420 --> 25:45.620
Lyra is indistinct because she
followed Asriel through the Anomaly.

25:45.620 --> 25:47.500
Lyra is in this other world.

25:48.460 --> 25:51.860
Will you join us
through the Anomaly?

25:51.860 --> 25:55.580
I will go with you gladly,
but it is heavily guarded.

25:55.580 --> 25:57.260
I am ready to fight.

25:58.380 --> 26:02.220
The Magisterium are weak. Pathetic.

26:02.220 --> 26:04.700
They hide behind gunships and bombs.

26:06.260 --> 26:08.100
We do not.

26:08.100 --> 26:11.100
Once we are through,
I'm going to get Asriel.

26:12.180 --> 26:14.780
He needs to return
and finish what he started.

26:17.740 --> 26:20.980
The Magisterium will pay
for what they did to us.

26:40.220 --> 26:42.860
Relax.
You're gripping it too tight.

26:50.260 --> 26:53.620
I saw something! Like thin strings
that were almost invisible.

26:53.620 --> 26:56.180
I felt them connect with the knife.

26:56.180 --> 26:58.260
Yes! Good.

26:58.260 --> 27:01.340
This time,
don't lose sight of those strings.

27:02.740 --> 27:06.540
For each string is an opening
into another unique world.

27:07.980 --> 27:10.900
Slide the knife into them and down.

27:10.900 --> 27:13.180
Make a cut.

27:13.180 --> 27:15.780
You will feel a powerful resistance.

27:15.780 --> 27:17.300
OK.

27:39.500 --> 27:40.860
Ha!

27:41.980 --> 27:45.100
Wow! You did it, Will!

27:46.780 --> 27:48.660
Now you must learn to close.

27:49.900 --> 27:51.140
Sheath the knife.

27:55.020 --> 27:58.340
For this you need to put your soul
into your fingertips.

27:58.340 --> 28:01.620
Touch very delicately
until you feel the edge.

28:01.620 --> 28:03.260
Then pinch it together.

28:15.060 --> 28:16.500
It's gone.

28:16.500 --> 28:18.500
That was easy.

28:18.500 --> 28:21.580
You're a fast learner,
much faster than I was.

28:23.620 --> 28:27.580
Now listen, there are four things
you need to know.

28:28.940 --> 28:33.540
First, never open a window
without closing it.

28:35.300 --> 28:38.460
The windows left open have done
great damage.

28:38.460 --> 28:43.020
Second, never let anyone else
use the knife.

28:43.020 --> 28:46.780
Third, don't use it
for base purposes -

28:46.780 --> 28:51.580
don't show it off,
don't let it inflate your ego.

28:51.580 --> 28:55.540
And lastly, keep it secret.

28:55.540 --> 28:58.380
It mustn't fall into
the wrong hands.

28:58.380 --> 29:01.020
You have come here
for a purpose, boy.

29:01.020 --> 29:05.540
Maybe you don't know what that is,
but you're brave.

29:05.540 --> 29:09.220
And your friend here
with the daemon is wise.

29:10.900 --> 29:12.740
The knife will protect you.

29:15.060 --> 29:18.740
But promise me
that you will protect it, too.

29:19.900 --> 29:21.020
I promise.

29:21.020 --> 29:24.700
I sense you'll be a better bearer
than I was. Now go.

29:26.900 --> 29:29.300
But without the knife
the Spectres will get you.

29:29.300 --> 29:31.180
Come with us, you'll be safe.

29:31.180 --> 29:34.140
No, Will, I have fulfilled my duty.

29:34.140 --> 29:38.140
The knife has been passed on.
You must find your own path now.

29:39.340 --> 29:41.940
I'd like to meet my destiny
in private.

30:02.220 --> 30:03.460
Will.

30:04.740 --> 30:06.060
Let him go.

30:08.420 --> 30:09.940
Come on, we need to go.

30:16.580 --> 30:19.100
Good evening, Miss. MRS Coulter.

30:19.100 --> 30:21.780
Yes, your friend is
waiting for you. Thank you.

30:23.860 --> 30:26.380
Marisa. Carlo.

30:29.500 --> 30:30.540
You look well.

30:31.700 --> 30:34.660
The north has always
agreed with you.

30:48.940 --> 30:50.260
Cheers.

30:53.260 --> 30:55.860
Such a mysterious summons, Carlo.

30:55.860 --> 30:57.340
What have you done?

31:00.620 --> 31:02.140
Thank you.

31:08.020 --> 31:09.700
It's Lyra.

31:09.700 --> 31:11.220
I've found her.

31:13.100 --> 31:15.660
She's in Oxford.

31:15.660 --> 31:17.700
Just not this Oxford.

31:19.660 --> 31:25.540
Asriel, always so insistent
he be the first to do everything.

31:27.460 --> 31:30.860
Busting his way through
multiple worlds.

31:30.860 --> 31:36.180
Some of us have found simpler,
less dramatic doors.

31:37.660 --> 31:38.740
Go on.

31:42.780 --> 31:47.140
I've found a window,
into another Oxford.

31:49.220 --> 31:52.820
And to my surprise, Lyra was there.

31:55.580 --> 31:59.940
I have her trapped, her and some boy
that she was travelling with.

32:01.540 --> 32:02.620
Good.

32:05.340 --> 32:08.700
But you do realise that Lyra has
a tendency to escape traps.

32:11.540 --> 32:16.540
I made a bargain - that she and
the boy acquire something for me.

32:18.340 --> 32:22.340
Something that's beyond my reach.

32:24.180 --> 32:26.060
They're fetching it now.

32:26.060 --> 32:30.140
And when they return it to me,
she's yours.

32:33.380 --> 32:37.180
Oh, so, in fact,
you don't have her at all?

32:40.100 --> 32:44.020
I have something that's
vital of hers. Something vital?

32:47.740 --> 32:49.300
She'll return.

32:51.740 --> 32:53.220
Then she's mine.

32:55.060 --> 32:56.420
Yes.

32:57.740 --> 32:59.140
A gift.

33:02.220 --> 33:03.780
From me...

33:09.460 --> 33:10.940
..to you.

33:18.420 --> 33:20.020
Very well, Carlo.

33:20.020 --> 33:23.580
Take me to another world.

33:42.460 --> 33:43.820
What is it?

33:44.980 --> 33:47.420
Will, we need to go, come on.

33:47.420 --> 33:49.220
Come on, Will, we need to go.

33:49.220 --> 33:51.220
We need to go now, Will. Come on.

36:06.220 --> 36:09.140
Stay with me and move quickly.

37:35.460 --> 37:37.180
Come on, Paola. It's time for bed.

37:40.540 --> 37:41.580
Angelica!

38:44.700 --> 38:47.540
Don't worry. I'm not looking.
Coming up backwards.

38:47.540 --> 38:49.260
I'm just bringing towels.

39:02.540 --> 39:06.700
I'm so sorry, Will. I'm so sorry.

39:11.860 --> 39:14.060
I have to tell you something.

39:14.060 --> 39:18.220
Before I lost the Alethiometer,
it told me you were important -

39:18.220 --> 39:20.820
that you were connected to
this place.

39:20.820 --> 39:22.500
I think it meant The Knife.

39:22.500 --> 39:25.900
Like Mr Paradisi said,
you were chosen, Will,

39:25.900 --> 39:28.140
and that's because of
the person you are.

39:30.780 --> 39:32.660
So what do you want to do now?

39:35.300 --> 39:37.420
We've got to get the Alethiometer
back...

39:39.180 --> 39:40.700
..so we'll have to steal it.

39:44.060 --> 39:45.780
Latrom's dangerous.

39:48.060 --> 39:49.300
We'll do it.

39:50.660 --> 39:51.700
Together.

39:55.500 --> 39:57.220
Goodnight, Will Parry...

39:58.740 --> 40:00.300
..Bearer of The Knife.

40:02.260 --> 40:04.180
Goodnight, Lyra Silvertongue.

40:51.380 --> 40:52.700
There she is!

40:58.100 --> 40:59.740
She may not look like much.

41:03.060 --> 41:05.100
Wait till you see her fly.

41:05.100 --> 41:06.780
We'd better get a move on.

41:06.780 --> 41:09.540
I'm sort of a wanted man
around these parts.

41:09.540 --> 41:13.060
The Magisterium is after me
and they know I'm an aeronaut.

41:13.060 --> 41:16.020
Anyway, I probably should've
told you all that before.

41:16.020 --> 41:17.900
Anyway, let's hope for good wind.

41:17.900 --> 41:20.260
Just leave the winds to me.

41:25.980 --> 41:29.060
Looks like our Shaman's all hat
and no cattle.

41:31.100 --> 41:32.900
We're going nowhere fast.

41:54.020 --> 41:56.380
Woohoo!

41:57.540 --> 42:01.740
Shaman, remind me to add "aeronaut"
to your list of accomplishments.

42:03.220 --> 42:05.900
Lyra Silvertongue, we're on our way!

42:26.060 --> 42:27.540
Let's try this again.

42:43.540 --> 42:46.100
Focus all attention
on attention itself.

42:48.380 --> 42:52.060
Don't project. Just...observe.

42:58.860 --> 43:00.140
Right, OK.

43:05.140 --> 43:06.380
Show me.

43:17.660 --> 43:19.340
Ask a question.

43:27.740 --> 43:28.940
OK.

43:30.540 --> 43:31.620
OK.

43:44.060 --> 43:45.540
Are you Shadows?

43:47.500 --> 43:48.740
Yes.

43:55.300 --> 43:58.220
Are Shadows the same as Lyra's Dust?

43:58.220 --> 43:59.660
Yes.

44:01.540 --> 44:03.180
And is dust Dark Matter?

44:03.180 --> 44:04.420
Yes.

44:06.140 --> 44:09.220
So Dark Matter is conscious?

44:09.220 --> 44:10.540
Evidently.

44:16.780 --> 44:19.940
The mind that's answering
these questions -

44:19.940 --> 44:21.540
it isn't human, is it?

44:21.540 --> 44:22.660
No.

44:22.660 --> 44:26.260
But humans have always known us.

44:26.260 --> 44:28.700
There's more than one of you?

44:28.700 --> 44:30.980
Uncountable billions.

44:32.740 --> 44:34.740
But what are you?

44:34.740 --> 44:36.180
Angels.

44:43.220 --> 44:45.460
Angels? Yes.

44:52.380 --> 44:58.580
Angels are creatures made up
of Shadow-matter, of Dust?

44:58.580 --> 44:59.820
Yes.

44:59.820 --> 45:04.260
And Shadow-matter is
what we call spirit?

45:04.260 --> 45:07.460
From what we are, spirit.

45:07.460 --> 45:10.580
From what we do, matter.

45:10.580 --> 45:14.180
Matter and spirit are one.

45:14.180 --> 45:15.980
You've always been there?

45:17.060 --> 45:18.380
Making.

45:18.380 --> 45:19.940
Stimulating.

45:19.940 --> 45:21.300
Guiding.

45:21.300 --> 45:27.340
So does that mean Angels have
intervened in human evolution?

45:27.340 --> 45:28.940
Yes.

45:28.940 --> 45:30.020
But why?

45:31.980 --> 45:33.860
Vengeance.

45:54.940 --> 45:56.540
There's something out there.

46:05.900 --> 46:08.900
Two, three, four
incoming flying objects.

46:14.380 --> 46:17.300
Witches! Fire! Fire!

46:17.300 --> 46:18.380
Man the guns!
