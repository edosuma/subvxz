00:09.388 --> 00:10.631
Let's go!

00:10.734 --> 00:12.736
NARRATOR: Chef Ramsay taskedthe chefs with a seemingly

00:12.840 --> 00:13.806
simple challenge--

00:13.910 --> 00:15.877
That seems, like,
deceptively easy--

00:15.981 --> 00:18.777
NARRATOR: --but quicklyrevealed a jaw dropping twist.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.054
GORDON RAMSAY: One
chef from each team

00:20.158 --> 00:22.298
is going to leave the
kitchen right now!

00:22.401 --> 00:23.437

team left one by one.

00:28.994 --> 00:30.340
TREVOR: The less people
in the kitchen right

00:30.444 --> 00:31.686
now the more I get to shine.

00:31.790 --> 00:33.205
NARRATOR: But it was
Motto who remained

00:33.309 --> 00:34.310
the last man standing--

00:34.413 --> 00:35.759
This is mine.
I got this.

00:35.863 --> 00:36.864
NARRATOR: --in
the blue kitchen--

00:36.967 --> 00:38.624
I'll go.
This is good to go.

00:38.728 --> 00:41.041
NARRATOR: The women left thekitchen with little fight.

00:41.144 --> 00:42.007

00:43.526 --> 00:45.838
NARRATOR: Ariel was confidentshe had it all under control.

00:45.942 --> 00:47.392
It feels like I'm on fire.

I don't need any
help from anyone.

00:49.566 --> 00:51.948
NARRATOR: At judging, Motto'sgrits got the red team off

00:52.052 --> 00:53.018

00:53.122 --> 00:54.433
I mean, that is extraordinary.

00:54.537 --> 00:56.677
NARRATOR: But Ariel's chickenpiccata brought the women back.

00:56.780 --> 00:58.196
The point is the blue team.

00:58.299 --> 00:59.542
Great job.

00:59.645 --> 01:01.509
NARRATOR: And just when itlooked like Trevor's cioppino

01:01.613 --> 01:02.545
had won it for the men--

01:02.648 --> 01:03.994
The dish of the day--

01:04.098 --> 01:04.892
Thank you, chef.

01:04.995 --> 01:06.135

That's such a shame,

01:07.067 --> 01:08.033
you're missing a key ingredient.

01:08.137 --> 01:09.483
Ah, motherfuck--

fish on the plate.

NARRATOR: --cost
the men the victory.

01:12.796 --> 01:14.833

01:27.949 --> 01:32.126
The chefs who stayed in

02:16.412 --> 02:18.034
TREVOR: I was really hopingthat we were going to be

02:18.138 --> 02:19.449
able to get rid of Scott Lee.

02:19.553 --> 02:22.625
Enough of this, you know, alphamale bullshit and everything.

02:22.728 --> 02:27.388
It's a competition for cooking,not how big your huevos are.

02:27.492 --> 02:28.907
You and me sitting
here, I wanted fucking

02:29.010 --> 02:30.391
Scott Lee's ass out of here.I did.

02:30.495 --> 02:31.530
And I know he knows it, too.

02:31.634 --> 02:32.876
And I, you know, I don't care.

02:32.980 --> 02:34.361
Say it to your fucking face.

02:34.464 --> 02:35.603
So you don't want
Scotley here, why?

02:35.707 --> 02:36.949
Because of--

02:37.053 --> 02:38.330
Because he's--

02:38.434 --> 02:39.745
Talented?
Because he's--

02:39.849 --> 02:40.781
No, not that.

02:40.884 --> 02:42.748
It's the wrong attitude
and everything.

02:42.852 --> 02:44.371
Eh, I get it.

02:44.474 --> 02:46.683
I'm trying to present myselfin an executive chef fashion.

02:46.787 --> 02:47.719
Yeah.

02:47.822 --> 02:49.099
And he keeps
calling me out saying

02:49.203 --> 02:50.618
that I'm trying to fucking showoff for chef and everything.

02:50.722 --> 02:51.826
My voice is running
whether or not

02:51.930 --> 02:52.965
chef's in that fucking kitchen.

02:53.069 --> 02:53.863
I ain't trying to show off.

02:53.966 --> 02:54.829
Understandable.

02:54.933 --> 02:55.934
And that's part
of the game, yeah?

02:56.037 --> 02:57.418
It's a game, man.

02:57.522 --> 02:59.662
Play it.

02:59.765 --> 03:05.599
[suspenseful music]

03:09.119 --> 03:10.811
Some grilled shrimp inthere would have been tits.

03:14.608 --> 03:15.436
What?

03:15.540 --> 03:18.128
You have to be so grotesque?

03:18.232 --> 03:20.648
What do you mean, it would'vebeen-- it would've been good.

03:20.752 --> 03:22.305
I'm sorry I said it.
It's a Northeast thing.

03:22.409 --> 03:23.513
MIA: Mm.

03:23.617 --> 03:24.480
It has nothing to do withbeing gross, sweetheart,

03:24.583 --> 03:26.827
and I mean no disrespect by it.

03:26.930 --> 03:27.897
MIA: I'm not your sweetheart.

03:28.000 --> 03:28.794
OK.

03:28.898 --> 03:29.830
Mia.

[LAUGHING]

03:32.315 --> 03:34.697
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Bret.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.458
So in the Northeast, whensomething's good or great,

03:37.562 --> 03:39.219
you say, it's the tits.

03:39.322 --> 03:41.531
[LAUGHING] I like how he'sbreaking this down for her.

03:41.635 --> 03:44.500
So in the Northeast, whensomething's fantastic,

03:44.603 --> 03:45.673
it's the tits.

03:45.777 --> 03:47.019
Don't take it personal.

03:47.123 --> 03:48.055
No, it's not personal.

03:48.158 --> 03:49.781
You're tougher than that.

03:49.884 --> 03:51.127
So you shouldn't
be offended by it.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.819
I'm not offended.

03:53.923 --> 03:55.338
Just trying to change it.

03:55.442 --> 03:57.444
You're not going tochange the way that I talk.

03:57.547 --> 03:58.928
Not going to happen.

03:59.031 --> 04:00.654
So you don't want toimprove yourself a little bit?

04:00.757 --> 04:02.483
I'm just fine, improving
just well in life.

04:02.587 --> 04:03.381
Thank you, though.

04:03.484 --> 04:04.244
OK.

04:07.005 --> 04:09.007
Bret's saying, oh yeah,I'm never going to change.

04:09.110 --> 04:10.940
It's like, well, you're
never going to learn,

04:11.043 --> 04:12.355
you're never going to grow.

04:12.459 --> 04:16.083
And you're always going to bethe same old fucking idiot.

04:16.186 --> 04:18.568

04:56.503 --> 04:58.125
This is big.

04:58.228 --> 05:01.197
Congratulations.

05:01.301 --> 05:05.063
Every chef I know,
their love of cooking

05:05.166 --> 05:07.376
began when they were young.

05:07.479 --> 05:11.518
Right now, I'd like you
all to close your eyes.

05:11.621 --> 05:13.105
Think about when you wereyoung, when you first

05:13.209 --> 05:14.555
fell in love with cooking.

05:14.659 --> 05:18.801
When you were excited
to cook that first meal.

05:18.904 --> 05:20.078
Can you see it?

05:20.181 --> 05:21.390
Yes, chef.

05:21.493 --> 05:22.287
Open your eyes.

05:25.290 --> 05:27.603
[laughter]

05:27.706 --> 05:30.053
What?

05:30.157 --> 05:32.021
Oh, that's so embarrassing.

Kanae, I'm lost for words.

05:33.850 --> 05:34.713
KANAE: It was homecoming.

05:48.037 --> 05:49.487

shells you're wearing?

06:05.606 --> 06:06.400
What are those things?

06:06.504 --> 06:08.437
Puka shells and braces, chef.

06:08.540 --> 06:09.507
Scotley!

06:09.610 --> 06:10.508
[laughter]

06:10.611 --> 06:12.233
I love the braids.

06:12.337 --> 06:15.685
I was living my SnoopDogg dreams at that time.

06:15.789 --> 06:16.617
Wow.

06:16.721 --> 06:17.929

08:02.551 --> 08:04.242
with cooking at a young age.

She comes from a

How was the flight?

08:35.376 --> 08:36.170
It was long.

08:36.274 --> 08:37.275
How's the boyfriend?

08:37.378 --> 08:38.276
I don't have one!

08:38.379 --> 08:39.173
Good, good, good, good.

Keep it like that.

08:40.312 --> 08:41.866
SCOTLEY: They
definitely look alike.

08:41.969 --> 08:45.490
The eyebrows, the
hair, the smile.

08:45.594 --> 08:46.664
My goodness!

08:46.767 --> 08:50.357

cuter than Chef Ramsay.

09:22.458 --> 09:23.908

09:26.013 --> 09:26.945
GORDON RAMSAY: That's generous.

09:27.049 --> 09:28.533

NARRATOR: As the teams
continue to cook,

10:14.752 --> 10:17.168

moment to talk to Tilly

10:17.271 --> 10:18.756
about her party requests.

10:18.859 --> 10:20.758
Anything you do not
want to see tonight?

10:20.861 --> 10:22.380
Can you try to control
your temper tonight?

10:22.483 --> 10:23.830
Because don't want you

The team that gets the
most dishes on the menu

11:53.091 --> 11:54.748

11:54.852 --> 11:56.232
Roe, describe
your dish, please.

11:56.336 --> 11:57.855
I wanted to do a
lighter appetizer.

11:57.958 --> 11:59.580
I did our pan seared scallops.

11:59.684 --> 12:01.444
Tried to plate it in the shapeof a T, because after all,

12:01.548 --> 12:02.514
it is Tilly's night.

12:02.618 --> 12:05.414
I love the T.
It's really nice.

12:05.517 --> 12:06.346
Wow.

12:06.449 --> 12:08.141
Interesting.

12:08.244 --> 12:10.764
Ricotta scallops-- that's abit of a strange combination

12:10.868 --> 12:11.696
for me.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.422
I love the orange
in the pesto.

12:24.674 --> 12:25.710
Right.

Well, I think it screamsfun, and I love the sauce.

12:36.617 --> 12:37.687

Good job.

12:41.450 --> 12:44.453

Chicken, shrimp, and steak.

12:47.870 --> 12:49.044
GORDON RAMSAY: Um, I mean--

12:49.147 --> 12:52.599
I don't think of kebabs
for 16-year-olds.

12:52.702 --> 12:53.738
Uh, oh.

12:53.842 --> 12:55.257

12:55.360 --> 12:57.224

12:57.328 --> 12:58.743
Would you like them on the menu?

13:24.976 --> 13:27.979
Well, I didn't have
to think about this one.

13:28.083 --> 13:29.118
That's a definite yes.

13:46.170 --> 13:47.447
Why crudo?

13:47.550 --> 13:51.623
I didn't want to just do thesame seared scallops that we

13:51.727 --> 13:54.799
serve every day for service.

13:54.903 --> 13:56.318
Well, I love how
fresh it tasted.

13:56.421 --> 14:00.840
But it wasn't my favorite one.

14:00.943 --> 14:01.771
GORDON RAMSAY: Yes or no?

14:01.875 --> 14:03.118
I think it's a
no for that one.

14:03.221 --> 14:04.291
A no.

added a rosemary foam on top.

14:35.736 --> 14:36.737
I love the look of it.

14:36.841 --> 14:38.118
And mushrooms are my
favorite vegetables.

Chunk chunk.

19:31.066 --> 19:33.172
I don't know about that.

19:33.275 --> 19:34.483
This is really
important to chef.

This is his daughter,
it's her sweet 16.

19:37.245 --> 19:39.385
Um, and we got to do it right.

I'm an intelligent guy.

20:07.067 --> 20:09.242
But none of it makes sense.

20:09.346 --> 20:11.244
Remind me never to do tissuepompoms for my daughter.

20:15.110 --> 20:17.526
That looks nothing

You know what your bloodpressure normally is?

21:19.105 --> 21:20.382
No.

21:20.486 --> 21:21.487
I haven't checked my bloodpressure in god knows how long.

At this point, we usuallygo ahead and call 911, have

21:29.149 --> 21:30.427

about Roe, however,

was too much garlic.

32:03.231 --> 32:04.405
GORDON RAMSAY:
--cloves of garlic.

32:04.508 --> 32:05.337
We don't work like that.

32:05.440 --> 32:06.407
We don't just clump garlic.

32:06.510 --> 32:08.305
Garlic, lightly saute first.

32:08.409 --> 32:09.306
TREVOR: Yes, chef.

32:09.410 --> 32:10.859
It's like disappointing
your dad, man.

32:10.963 --> 32:12.240
It really is.

32:12.344 --> 32:14.518
And when he has to come overand show you, it's embarrassing.

32:14.622 --> 32:15.416
Finesse.

32:15.519 --> 32:16.417
caramelized garlic.

32:16.520 --> 32:17.694
You hit it with
the spinach, right?

32:17.797 --> 32:19.040
- Yes.
- Correct the seasoning.

32:19.144 --> 32:19.938
Yes.

32:20.041 --> 32:23.079
Shit!

32:23.182 --> 32:24.597
I don't want to freak
you out, but table 99.

32:24.701 --> 32:25.874
Yeah?
It's Tilly's table.

32:25.978 --> 32:27.497
Two New York strip, onehalibut, one fish and chips.

32:27.600 --> 32:28.394
Yes.

32:28.498 --> 32:29.533
Yes chef.

32:29.637 --> 32:31.121
Sorry, baby.

32:31.225 --> 32:32.674
Two minutes coming
with the halibut.

32:32.778 --> 32:34.573
We started off a
little rough but I

32:34.676 --> 32:37.403
don't want to disappoint Tilly.

32:37.507 --> 32:40.510
I want to give her
a night to remember.

32:40.613 --> 32:41.442
I'm walking halibut.

32:41.545 --> 32:42.512
Heard.

32:42.615 --> 32:43.892
New York strips are
30 seconds behind.

32:43.996 --> 32:44.790
Yup.

32:44.893 --> 32:45.791
Are you guys hungry?

32:45.894 --> 32:46.688
I'm starving.

32:52.729 --> 32:53.902
GORDON RAMSAY: Hey.
Hey.

32:54.006 --> 32:55.387
How long do you need?
GORDON RAMSAY: Hey, no.

32:55.490 --> 32:56.388
Hey all of you, come here.

32:57.734 --> 32:59.046
Come here.

32:59.149 --> 33:03.636
I-- I-- I'm lost for words.

33:03.740 --> 33:06.950
[SHOUTING] This is
Matilda's table!

33:07.054 --> 33:08.055
Fuck!

33:08.158 --> 33:09.263
I have another one
right here, chef.

33:09.366 --> 33:12.059
I had such a perfectly
cooked halibut for him.

33:12.162 --> 33:14.130
I was rushing and
brought the wrong pan.

33:14.233 --> 33:15.269
GORDON RAMSAY:
It's-- it's-- fuck.

33:15.372 --> 33:16.580
Just touch that.

33:16.684 --> 33:18.306
I gave you the wrong one.GORDON RAMSAY: Just touch it.

33:18.410 --> 33:19.100
I gave him the wrong one.

33:19.204 --> 33:19.894
That's the right one there.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.447
I don't care what you've done.

33:21.551 --> 33:22.345
It's raw!

33:22.448 --> 33:23.277
Oh!

33:23.380 --> 33:24.830
Oh, he just threw it!

33:28.868 --> 33:29.973
NARRATOR: It's an
hour and a half

33:30.077 --> 33:32.010
into Chef Ramsay's
daughter Tilly's

33:32.113 --> 33:34.115
16th birthday celebration.

33:34.219 --> 33:35.392
I'm lost for words.

33:35.496 --> 33:37.946
NARRATOR: But Ariel's rawhalibut for Tilly's table

33:38.050 --> 33:39.879
has made this night
anything but sweet.

33:39.983 --> 33:40.777
I gave him the wrong one.

33:40.880 --> 33:41.950
[interposing voices]

33:42.054 --> 33:43.469
GORDON RAMSAY: I don't
care what you've done!

33:43.573 --> 33:44.367
It's raw!

33:44.470 --> 33:45.299
Oh!

33:45.402 --> 33:46.541
Oh, he just threw it!

33:46.645 --> 33:49.993
HEATHER: Oh, sweet baby Jesus.

33:50.097 --> 33:52.685
Wave the white flag.

33:52.789 --> 33:57.759
For the last five fuckingtables, timing is way off!

33:57.863 --> 34:00.659
What's happening?

34:00.762 --> 34:03.144
[SHOUTING] Get out!

34:03.248 --> 34:04.111
Get out!

34:07.217 --> 34:08.598
I'm the one who's
got to stand there

34:08.701 --> 34:11.325
in embarrassment with thefucking stupidity on my face.

34:11.428 --> 34:12.257
Yes chef.

34:12.360 --> 34:13.775
Get out!

34:13.879 --> 34:16.537
Hey, two nominees don't
make your team stronger.

34:16.640 --> 34:17.469
Yes chef.

34:17.572 --> 34:20.161
Sweet 16, my ass!

34:20.265 --> 34:22.439
You'd be feeling pretty goodif you were the red right now,

34:22.543 --> 34:23.371
wouldn't you?

34:23.475 --> 34:24.407
Motto, Scotley.

34:24.510 --> 34:25.856
Jos , let's go.

34:25.960 --> 34:28.652
NARRATOR: With some of Tilly'sguests still waiting on food--

34:28.756 --> 34:30.137
Walking to the path, chef.

34:30.240 --> 34:31.828
NARRATOR: --the red
team's talented rookies

34:31.931 --> 34:33.485
take over the blue kitchen--

34:33.588 --> 34:35.245
I have the fish
and chips for you.

34:35.349 --> 34:36.557
TILLY:
- you.

34:36.660 --> 34:38.179
NARRATOR: --and deliver thefinal dishes of the night.

34:38.283 --> 34:39.353
Well, I have to
say, nobody makes

34:39.456 --> 34:40.906
fish and chips like my dad.

34:41.009 --> 34:42.321
Good job over
there, by the way.

34:42.425 --> 34:43.253
Hey, Motto.

34:43.357 --> 34:44.496
On point.
MOTTO: Thank you chef.

34:44.599 --> 34:45.531
Yeah, Jos .

34:45.635 --> 34:46.394
That's the best
performance you put in.

34:46.498 --> 34:47.361
Yes chef!

34:47.464 --> 34:48.741
To go into the
blue kitchen today

34:48.845 --> 34:51.019
and finish up their
dinner service--

34:51.123 --> 34:51.917
that was a good feeling.

34:52.020 --> 34:53.539
Thank you very
much for coming.

34:53.643 --> 34:54.609
It's been really fun.

34:54.713 --> 34:55.990
And thank you for
the really good food.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.025
Pleasure.
Thank you.

34:57.129 --> 34:58.441
I'm glad you
could all make it.

34:58.544 --> 34:59.338
It's been really special.

34:59.442 --> 35:00.236
Excellent.

35:00.339 --> 35:01.616
Thank you!

35:01.720 --> 35:03.515
[applause]

35:06.552 --> 35:10.280
[suspenseful music]

35:10.384 --> 35:12.006
Ugh!

35:12.110 --> 35:14.112
MIA: I feel like we all
let Chef Ramsay down.

35:14.215 --> 35:16.148
I'm mostly upset about
that because it's

35:16.252 --> 35:17.839
his daughter's birthday.

35:17.943 --> 35:20.739
This wasn't the
service to fuck up.

35:24.018 --> 35:26.607
All right, where
are we starting?

35:26.710 --> 35:28.333
I'm not going to
beat around the bush.

35:28.436 --> 35:32.164
Meat, fish and chips, and thenmy last-- the last halibut.

35:32.268 --> 35:33.234
Yes.

35:33.338 --> 35:35.512
That's the order of
the fuckups tonight.

35:35.616 --> 35:36.720
Yeah.

35:36.824 --> 35:38.895
Who was cooking thefish and chips over there?

35:38.998 --> 35:40.172
I was cooking
the fish and chips.

35:40.276 --> 35:42.968
The last ones I got
sent back is because I

35:43.071 --> 35:44.694
had to refire one that I--

35:44.797 --> 35:46.454
No, but I'm talking aboutthe ones from earlier.

35:46.558 --> 35:48.353
Just not double coating--

35:48.456 --> 35:49.664
You had the batter wrong.

35:49.768 --> 35:52.080
MIA: Like, I fucked up
a fish, but Kanae also

35:52.184 --> 35:53.427
fucked up a fish.

35:53.530 --> 35:55.118
Your tartare was getting
sent back because it

35:55.222 --> 35:56.602
wasn't sliced properly--
[interposing voices]

35:57.603 --> 35:58.708
Yeah.

35:58.811 --> 36:00.848
Mia needs someone totake the heat off of her,

36:00.951 --> 36:02.850
and I'm not buying it.

36:02.953 --> 36:04.162
I'm not having it.

36:04.265 --> 36:05.093
I vote Roe and Kanae.

36:07.958 --> 36:09.684
I'm going to go Roe and Mia.

36:09.788 --> 36:11.997
Roe and Mia.

36:12.100 --> 36:14.551
So, Roe and Mia.

36:14.655 --> 36:16.519
I vote for me and Ariel.

36:16.622 --> 36:17.830
ROE: Well I'm not
going down like this.

36:17.934 --> 36:19.832
Chef Ramsay knows that
I'm a strong chef.

36:19.936 --> 36:21.351
I think he knows it
was a meat heavy night,

36:21.455 --> 36:22.559
and I think he knows
that there were

36:22.663 --> 36:24.251
two motherfuckers over on fish.

36:24.354 --> 36:27.771
I know the steaks slowedup things, but I was alone.

36:27.875 --> 36:29.739
There was two of
you guys over there.

36:29.842 --> 36:31.465
So it's not all on Mia.

36:31.568 --> 36:33.915
Like, if that's yourstation, you have to own it.

36:34.019 --> 36:37.091
So would you rather
I go up than Mia?

36:37.195 --> 36:38.679
One station, two people.

36:38.782 --> 36:40.439
So if anything happens onthat station, it's both

36:40.543 --> 36:42.510
of y'alls responsibility.

36:42.614 --> 36:44.685
You're not not going
up for the meat tonight.

36:44.788 --> 36:46.376
There's no fucking way.

36:46.480 --> 36:48.827
I accept and own my mistakes.

36:48.930 --> 36:50.691
But between Roe and I--

36:50.794 --> 36:52.969
are you kidding me?

36:53.072 --> 36:53.866
Like, whatever.

36:53.970 --> 36:55.627
I don't-- I can't--

36:55.730 --> 36:56.697
I don't understand.

36:56.800 --> 36:58.630
Ariel, at the end,
when we needed it most--

36:58.733 --> 36:59.527
Yes, I know where--

36:59.631 --> 37:01.322
[interposing voices]

37:01.426 --> 37:02.530
Why did we need it most?

37:02.634 --> 37:05.740
Because the wholefucking night was fucked.

37:05.844 --> 37:07.294
ROE: Your meat's going
to get off scot-free.

37:07.397 --> 37:08.260
Sure, and send me and Mia up.

37:08.364 --> 37:09.399
Go ahead.

37:09.503 --> 37:11.194
When you learn how to
cook a mid-rare steak,

37:11.298 --> 37:12.471
you fucking call me.

37:15.612 --> 37:17.235
It's your station, dog.

37:17.338 --> 37:19.892
I said, I'll go up insteadof her if you'd like.

37:19.996 --> 37:20.928
Whatever you guys want to do.

37:21.031 --> 37:21.929
You're not getting it.

37:22.032 --> 37:24.000
ROE: Whatever you want to do.

37:24.103 --> 37:25.001
Go fuck yourself!

37:28.004 --> 37:30.317
[suspenseful music]

37:41.673 --> 37:43.537
Ladies, have you
reached a decision?

37:43.640 --> 37:44.883
Yes, chef.

37:44.986 --> 37:45.953
Heather.

37:46.056 --> 37:47.817
Blue team's first
nominee and why.

37:47.920 --> 37:49.991
First nominee
would be Roe, chef.

37:50.095 --> 37:52.408
We had all those
proteins come back

37:52.511 --> 37:55.169
and that killed themomentum of every station.

37:55.273 --> 37:57.171
GORDON RAMSAY: Blue
team's second nominee.

37:57.275 --> 37:58.241
Our second nominee, chef--

38:01.727 --> 38:03.177
Mia.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.592
GORDON RAMSAY: Why?

38:04.696 --> 38:07.423
We had at least two or threefish and chips come back first.

38:07.526 --> 38:09.217
They were battered improperly.

38:09.321 --> 38:12.359
And then the last one, chef,that was battered properly,

38:12.462 --> 38:13.808
came up to you raw.

38:13.912 --> 38:14.740
Roe, Mia.

38:14.844 --> 38:15.638
Step forward.

38:20.815 --> 38:22.955
Roe, why should you stay
in "Hell's Kitchen?"

38:23.059 --> 38:24.474
Chef, uh-- even
when things went

38:24.578 --> 38:27.788
wrong in our kitchen tonight, Inever gave up on my team, ever.

38:27.891 --> 38:29.928
I did the hardest thing,and that's not to shut down.

38:30.031 --> 38:31.930
I wanted to finish thatservice so badly for you, chef.

38:32.033 --> 38:33.069
I know what it meant for you.

38:33.172 --> 38:35.692
And I just wish we would
have performed better.

38:35.796 --> 38:36.762
Mia.

38:36.866 --> 38:39.109
Are you in way
over your head now?

38:39.213 --> 38:40.421
What happened tonight?

38:40.525 --> 38:43.597
When I came to my station,I didn't have batter done.

38:43.700 --> 38:44.977
Why not?

38:45.081 --> 38:45.875
I didn't set it up, chef.

38:45.978 --> 38:46.772
So I--

38:46.876 --> 38:48.049
Who set it up?

38:48.153 --> 38:51.432
Kanae set it up.

38:51.536 --> 38:53.400
So Kanae, you
set the station up,

38:53.503 --> 38:54.987
and you didn't make the batter?

38:55.091 --> 38:56.023
Chef, I--

38:56.126 --> 38:57.921
I started making
the batter as soon

38:58.025 --> 38:59.716
as we got into the kitchen.

38:59.820 --> 39:02.409
She's trying to
play the blame game.

39:02.512 --> 39:03.686
It was done before
dinner service.

39:03.789 --> 39:04.652
[interposing voices]

39:04.756 --> 39:05.412
It was done before
dinner service.

39:05.515 --> 39:08.449
She is lying right now.

39:08.553 --> 39:10.762
ARIEL: Regardless of
who set up, all stations

39:10.865 --> 39:11.763
were set up on time.

39:11.866 --> 39:13.143
So let's stop
talking about that.

39:13.247 --> 39:15.318
She's trying to playthe blame game right now.

39:15.422 --> 39:17.803
Mia, what separates
you from Roe?

39:17.907 --> 39:20.081
Chef, I was communicatingthe whole night.

39:20.185 --> 39:22.498
I do take ownership
of my station.

39:22.601 --> 39:25.224
Whenever I set up a station,I make sure that it's

39:25.328 --> 39:26.398
set up for success.

39:26.502 --> 39:28.780
And I feel like minewasn't set up for success.

39:28.883 --> 39:30.057
I'm a team player.

39:30.160 --> 39:31.817
And I'm a leader too.

39:31.921 --> 39:34.026
GORDON RAMSAY: Roe, what
separates you from Mia?

39:34.130 --> 39:35.338
I think Mia takes
a little bit longer

39:35.442 --> 39:36.857
to kick into the next gear.

39:36.960 --> 39:38.306
It's your station,
it's your setup,

39:38.410 --> 39:39.515
it's your responsibility.

39:39.618 --> 39:41.586
No matter what, no
matter who set it up.

39:41.689 --> 39:43.242
And I just think
I'm a stronger chef

39:43.346 --> 39:44.968
and that I can fight
back and stay vocal.

39:48.524 --> 39:50.940
My decision is--

39:51.043 --> 39:53.391
[suspenseful music]

39:58.085 --> 39:58.879
Mia.

40:01.882 --> 40:02.676
Back in line.

40:08.682 --> 40:14.032
Roe-- listen, and
listen carefully.

40:14.135 --> 40:15.378
When I put you on
meat tonight, I

40:15.482 --> 40:16.414
put you on there for a reason.

40:16.517 --> 40:19.002
Because I needed
to see the old Roe.

40:19.106 --> 40:21.764
And your performance tonightwas miles away from what you've

40:21.867 --> 40:23.282
done in this competition.- Yes, chef.

40:23.386 --> 40:24.387
GORDON RAMSAY:
Right now, you are

40:24.491 --> 40:28.115
not ready to be
my executive chef

40:28.218 --> 40:29.599
at "Hell's Kitchen," Las Vegas.

40:29.703 --> 40:31.118
Please give me your jacket.- Yes, chef.

40:32.119 --> 40:32.947
Thank you.

40:33.051 --> 40:33.845
Good night.

40:33.948 --> 40:34.777
ROE: Blue.

40:34.880 --> 40:35.674
Bye, Roe.

40:38.815 --> 40:39.920
ROE: I'm proud I
didn't shut down,

40:40.023 --> 40:41.335
I'm proud I never gave up.

40:41.439 --> 40:44.787
But the mistakes I did make werejust too severe to counteract

40:44.890 --> 40:45.926
some of the good I did tonight.

40:46.029 --> 40:47.375
And I totally own that.

40:47.479 --> 40:49.481
Chef Ramsay shook myhand, looked me in my eye.

40:49.585 --> 40:52.588
And that's the best way youcan go out of "Hell's Kitchen."

40:52.691 --> 40:53.968
Red team, great job.

40:54.072 --> 40:55.142
Well done, all of you.
Red team.

40:55.245 --> 40:56.281
Thank you, chef.

40:56.384 --> 40:58.939
Blue team--
quite the opposite.

40:59.042 --> 41:00.941
Now, get out of there.

41:01.044 --> 41:01.838
Yes, chef.

41:05.152 --> 41:06.602
Right there.

41:06.705 --> 41:08.258
That right there is goingto eat each other alive.

41:08.362 --> 41:09.984
That's good for us.

41:10.088 --> 41:11.710
Well, she didn't
set up my station.

41:11.814 --> 41:13.229
Well she said yabba dabba doo.

41:13.332 --> 41:15.783
It started because
they wanted her gone.

41:15.887 --> 41:17.198
Yes.

41:17.302 --> 41:19.235
I have a feeling that they'regoing to be really divided.

41:19.338 --> 41:20.961
And I don't think it'sgoing to be good for anybody

41:21.064 --> 41:22.100
on that team.

41:22.203 --> 41:23.964
Me and her were
communicating on it.

41:24.067 --> 41:26.449
I know, but nobody
communicated with me.

41:26.553 --> 41:27.933
I know they're saying,
oh, yeah, you know,

41:28.037 --> 41:29.176
she's playing the blame game.

41:29.279 --> 41:30.833
No, I'm not playing
the blame game.

41:30.936 --> 41:33.214
But I don't feel like
I was the one that

41:33.318 --> 41:34.837
should be up for elimination.

41:34.940 --> 41:37.011
The tempura batter
wasn't ready, so that;s

41:37.115 --> 41:38.737
why the first order came back.

41:38.841 --> 41:40.118
KANAE: Everything was set up.

41:40.221 --> 41:41.671
Mia has some little
chip on his shoulder

41:41.775 --> 41:45.054
that she can't get off, andthat chip gonna weigh her down.

41:45.157 --> 41:46.711
GORDON RAMSAY [VOICEOVER]:Last time she was here,

41:46.814 --> 41:49.058
Roe was a tour-de-force
on the meat station.

41:49.161 --> 41:51.957
But tonight, herperformance left me as cold

41:52.061 --> 41:53.131
as a raw New York strip.

41:59.102 --> 42:01.173
NARRATOR: Next time
on "Hell's Kitchen."

42:01.277 --> 42:03.210
The competition
is getting fierce.

42:03.313 --> 42:04.349
There's four of them.

42:04.452 --> 42:05.833
We don't want to be
embarrassed like that.

42:05.937 --> 42:07.939
NARRATOR: Will the men'slosing streak to the ladies--

42:08.042 --> 42:09.078
[LAUGHING] Yeah!

42:09.181 --> 42:11.011
NARRATOR: --lead tocracks in the foundation?

42:11.114 --> 42:13.047
Why don't you ask for itbefore we do that, though?

42:13.151 --> 42:13.945
TREVOR: No problem, boss.

42:14.048 --> 42:15.049
I'm right on top of that, boss.

42:15.153 --> 42:16.741
There you go with the
sarcastic shit, man.

42:16.844 --> 42:18.225
TREVOR: I'm going to
flip my lid pretty soon.

42:18.328 --> 42:19.778
I swear to fucking god.

42:19.882 --> 42:22.022
NARRATOR: --that will bringdown the entire kitchen.

42:22.125 --> 42:23.437
GORDON RAMSAY: [SHOUTING]This is a joke!

42:23.541 --> 42:25.301
ARIEL: They're flailing
around like idiots.

42:25.404 --> 42:27.959
NARRATOR: And when one chefsmells blood in the water--

42:28.062 --> 42:29.581
GORDON RAMSAY:
Just look at that!

42:29.685 --> 42:30.444
Textbook.

42:30.548 --> 42:31.583
Thank you, chef.

42:31.687 --> 42:33.171
It's like getting curb
stomped or something.

42:33.274 --> 42:34.724
NARRATOR: --will she
take the opportunity

42:34.828 --> 42:36.139
to go on the attack?

42:36.243 --> 42:37.244
Let me bring you some help.

42:37.347 --> 42:38.625
Ariel, come here.
- Yes, chef.

42:38.728 --> 42:39.971
There's nothing
you can do to fix it.

42:40.074 --> 42:41.938
ARIEL: I need that wellingtonto go with chef Christina.

42:42.042 --> 42:43.181
GORDON RAMSAY: Red
team, wellington.

42:43.284 --> 42:46.529
That's undercooked, and he'sjust sabotaged the size.

42:46.633 --> 42:47.703
NARRATOR: It's all next time--

42:47.806 --> 42:49.808
[SINGING] Gonna
fucking stab somebody--

42:49.912 --> 42:52.190
NARRATOR: On a kick themwhile they're down episode--

42:52.293 --> 42:53.398
ARIEL: I'm not an evil person.

42:53.501 --> 42:54.295
I swear.

42:54.399 --> 42:55.193
[evil laugh sound effect]

42:55.296 --> 42:57.575
NARRATOR: --of "Hell's Kitchen."
