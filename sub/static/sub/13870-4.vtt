women who wanted to conceive.

00:07.622 --> 00:10.533
I want your baby, Nathan Appleby.

00:10.534 --> 00:13.530
You will reap what has been sown.

00:14.546 --> 00:15.597
Nathan.

00:15.598 --> 00:18.537
This isn't a blessing,
nor is it a curse.

00:18.538 --> 00:20.514
I'm not pregnant. I think you are.

00:20.613 --> 00:23.564
One night in Shepzoy, I saw a woman.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.600
Gabriel drew a picture
of a woman with a book

00:25.601 --> 00:27.624
and so did Harriet.

00:27.625 --> 00:31.624
I heard Gabriel's voice.
I am sure of it.

00:31.625 --> 00:34.581
There's something here,
something bad.

00:37.541 --> 00:41.541
Never return to my land.
You are banished, Jack.

04:56.580 --> 04:59.564
See this? The linchpin's missing.

05:00.564 --> 05:02.531
Perhaps it is lost back there.

05:02.532 --> 05:05.563
Nowhere to be found, and I've
checked our other wagons.

05:25.567 --> 05:27.574
Not at all, Appleby.

05:27.575 --> 05:29.567
I was just passing and...

05:38.579 --> 05:40.562
DOOR CREAKS

05:40.563 --> 05:43.615
Are you here on church business
or personal business, Denning?

05:45.559 --> 05:51.589
You know, this fashion for
spiritualism, seances and such,

05:51.590 --> 05:55.585
I've found,
pursuing my pastoral duties,

05:55.586 --> 06:01.590
that it's often the symptom of a
more personal, deeper malaise.

06:03.586 --> 06:05.609
A bereavement.
If you're suggesting

06:05.610 --> 06:09.549
that my pursuit of the truth
is in relation to Gabriel...

06:09.550 --> 06:11.542
Only you can answer that, but...

06:12.574 --> 06:18.564
..if your deceased child is
the reason for your research,

06:18.565 --> 06:23.536
as your friend, I must caution you,
that way madness lies.

06:23.537 --> 06:24.541
And as my priest?

06:26.613 --> 06:31.520
You are transgressing
against God and nature.

FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

06:33.585 --> 06:35.601
Sir? You're wanted outside.

06:43.533 --> 06:44.549
Come.

06:45.557 --> 06:47.568
Nathan, we need those
wagons now, today.

06:47.569 --> 06:50.609
The wheelwright sent word. He can't
get 'em fixed till next week.

06:50.610 --> 06:53.571
That's too late. Well, who would
deliberately remove...

06:53.572 --> 06:55.519
I reckon it were Jack Langtree.

06:55.520 --> 06:57.604
Jack? Now, you stop, Isiah Cobb.

06:58.608 --> 07:01.571
Old Jack's not to be blamed
when everything goes awry.

07:01.572 --> 07:04.523
He's in London. No, he ain't.
I saw him here last night.

07:04.524 --> 07:05.535
Where did you see him?

07:05.536 --> 07:08.519
He were out here in the yard.
Saw him sneaking off, I did.

07:08.520 --> 07:09.540
I wondered what he was up to.

07:10.556 --> 07:13.555
I thought my nephew had taken
my advice and moved away.

07:13.556 --> 07:17.539
I warned him, Mr Appleby, I did.
Let bygones be bygones.

07:17.540 --> 07:21.560
But it seems like he's still
nursing a grudge against you.

07:33.595 --> 07:36.538
Shouldn't Miss Enderby be teaching
class this morning?

07:36.539 --> 07:38.567
Yes, she should.

07:41.591 --> 07:42.599
Miss Enderby?

07:44.607 --> 07:46.591
Are you all right?

07:48.530 --> 07:49.542
SHE GASPS

08:01.582 --> 08:02.598
Miss Enderby?

08:03.602 --> 08:05.518
Martha?

08:06.530 --> 08:07.550
It's all right.

08:08.550 --> 08:09.586
You're safe.

08:12.594 --> 08:14.513
Mr Appleby.

08:14.514 --> 08:16.518
Please drink something.

08:18.573 --> 08:19.577
Come on.

08:23.553 --> 08:25.513
It's all right.
You're very safe here.

08:31.593 --> 08:34.515
You seem distressed, Martha.

08:34.517 --> 08:37.513
Can you tell us what happened?

08:42.529 --> 08:44.524
I can't remember.

08:44.525 --> 08:45.589
Did you teach class this morning?

08:47.552 --> 08:49.539
No.

08:49.540 --> 08:50.596
Then where have you been?

08:52.596 --> 08:54.512
The woods.

08:56.512 --> 08:58.536
Elmwood Forest, and...

09:01.604 --> 09:03.564
..I don't remember.

09:05.568 --> 09:09.544
I can't remember.

09:10.604 --> 09:12.608

CAWING OUTSIDE

09:26.575 --> 09:27.578
(Jack.)

09:27.579 --> 09:29.574
Jack Langtree?

09:29.575 --> 09:32.562
Jack. He...he frightened me.

09:32.563 --> 09:33.599
He...

09:35.555 --> 09:37.518
..attacked me.

09:37.519 --> 09:39.566
Er... Oh, it...

09:39.567 --> 09:41.539
It was Jack...

09:43.547 --> 09:44.591
..but it wasn't Jack.

09:46.559 --> 09:47.599
There was something...

09:48.602 --> 09:52.542
Something? As if he were...

09:54.510 --> 09:55.514
..possessed.

10:02.590 --> 10:05.597
Her symptoms -
fragmented recollection,

10:05.598 --> 10:08.538
extreme agitation, confusion.

10:10.546 --> 10:13.553
I think her mind's endeavouring
to blank out something unspeakable.

10:13.554 --> 10:16.581
Poor child. One can only imagine
what's happened to her.

10:16.582 --> 10:20.594
I think I may need to take her back
into the forest today.

10:23.541 --> 10:25.584
Martha, do you feel you could show
me where Jack attacked you?

10:25.585 --> 10:28.560
Um...do you think that's wise?
She seems very fragile.

10:28.561 --> 10:31.572
But we need to find and apprehend
Jack Langtree.

10:31.573 --> 10:33.556
He attacked this defenceless
young woman.

10:33.557 --> 10:37.508
Our wagons are broken.
By Jack Langtree.

10:37.509 --> 10:40.557
We have no means of transportation.
I want to go back.

10:43.605 --> 10:46.576
Mr Appleby is right.

10:46.577 --> 10:49.521
Jack Langtree is a danger.

10:54.524 --> 10:58.559
I'm sorry. I'm not only responsible
for the farm and the servants

10:58.560 --> 11:01.588
and the workers, but in the absence
of a police officer...

11:02.588 --> 11:05.567
..I am responsible for the law
and order.

11:05.568 --> 11:07.583
It is the life we've chosen,
Charlotte.

11:07.584 --> 11:08.604
Yes, it is, isn't it?

11:10.572 --> 11:12.520
Leave the wagons to me.

11:26.567 --> 11:27.571
Martha.

11:28.587 --> 11:31.546
There's something I need to ask you.

11:31.547 --> 11:34.538
Did Jack Langtree in any way
force himself upon you?

11:34.539 --> 11:36.586
I mean sexually. No.

11:36.587 --> 11:38.519
It was nothing like that.

11:40.539 --> 11:44.510
And please forgive my intrusiveness.
I know it's very difficult for you,

11:44.511 --> 11:46.599
but... I understand you are doing
your duty, Mr Appleby.

11:48.598 --> 11:52.586

where Jack attacked you.

despite her lack of
formal education.

15:05.572 --> 15:11.540

15:23.535 --> 15:24.551
I was looking for Alice.

15:26.559 --> 15:27.571

15:29.503 --> 15:31.526
So, you left the pupils
at the school

15:51.546 --> 15:52.590
Alice was going to...

15:54.538 --> 15:56.517
..elope with him.

15:56.518 --> 15:58.565
Mr Appleby...

15:58.566 --> 16:02.545
Jack Langtree is not good
for Alice or any other girl.

16:02.546 --> 16:05.497
I was trying to find her.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.565
I was just trying to find her,
to make her see sense.

16:07.566 --> 16:09.526
And instead Jack Langtree found you?

16:10.550 --> 16:13.561
Now, you said he was possessed.
What did you mean?

16:13.562 --> 16:16.557
Mr Appleby, is it wise
to pursue this?

16:16.558 --> 16:19.522
Why wouldn't it be wise?
There's talk in the village.

16:19.523 --> 16:21.521
I hear things the children say.

16:23.541 --> 16:26.505
Things their parents have
said about... About me?

16:27.577 --> 16:29.517
What do they say about me?

16:33.521 --> 16:35.565
They say you're raising the dead.

16:38.545 --> 16:39.576
What do you think?

16:39.577 --> 16:43.593
I think you're
a good and decent man, Mr Appleby.

It's coming from down in that

There you are, ma'am. That'll get
rid of your sickness in no time.

17:06.579 --> 17:08.535
Oh.

17:08.536 --> 17:11.496
Prevent vomiting by feeding
me vomit.

17:15.512 --> 17:16.579
Actually, it's quite nice.
What's in it?

17:18.502 --> 17:20.499
Oh, what you don't know
won't hurt you, ma'am.

17:25.550 --> 17:28.546
You haven't told Mr Appleby about...

17:28.547 --> 17:29.563
No, I haven't.

17:34.591 --> 17:38.571
I will tell him.
He's already lost a child.

17:40.499 --> 17:42.518
And something may yet go wrong.

17:42.519 --> 17:44.507
No hope is better than false hope?

Could someone have brought

One of the workers, perhaps?
No, ma'am, definitely not.

21:09.552 --> 21:11.527
Alice?

21:11.528 --> 21:15.568
Alice! It's all right.
I mean you no harm.

21:17.491 --> 21:19.550
Alice! No! Leave her.

21:19.551 --> 21:21.539
Come back! Leave her alone!

21:22.567 --> 21:25.542
You came here to find Alice.

21:25.543 --> 21:28.502
No. Martha, I don't understand.

21:28.503 --> 21:31.574
You saw her face,
the way she looked at me.

21:31.575 --> 21:34.535
Please,
Mr Appleby, let her be. Please. Why?

21:35.547 --> 21:39.534
She hates me, despises me.
Listen to me, Martha.

21:39.535 --> 21:42.530
Your friend looked traumatised, the
same way you did when you arrived

21:42.531 --> 21:45.502
at Shepzoy. I cannot leave her,
knowing she may be under threat.

21:45.503 --> 21:47.559
We need to find her and bring
her home.

21:47.560 --> 21:50.513
I can't do that.
We've no other course open to us.

21:50.514 --> 21:51.538
I want to go back!

21:54.538 --> 21:55.546
I don't like it here.

21:57.530 --> 22:00.537
I want away from this place.
I have to go, Mr Appleby.

22:00.538 --> 22:01.561
I have to. No, Martha.

22:01.562 --> 22:03.486
You can't stop me.

22:12.486 --> 22:15.537
Then you follow that path out
of here back to Shepzoy House

22:15.538 --> 22:17.578
and you explain the situation
to Mrs Appleby.

22:19.493 --> 22:22.541
And you wait for me there.
Do you understand?

22:24.505 --> 22:25.581
I only wanted to help Alice.

22:27.541 --> 22:28.545
She's...

22:30.497 --> 22:31.557
..a flower of the forest.

22:32.565 --> 22:34.493
A secret flower.

22:35.569 --> 22:39.560
I truly believed she would bloom
into a woman of true substance.

22:39.561 --> 22:40.573
She will...

22:43.521 --> 22:45.521
..once I've brought her home safe.

22:48.556 --> 22:50.484
Go now.

23:49.494 --> 23:51.502
LLAMA BLEATS

23:53.506 --> 23:54.537
Mrs Appleby?

23:54.538 --> 23:57.533
I'm so sorry to intrude on you
like this, Mr Payne.

23:57.534 --> 23:58.578
I know you haven't been here long.

24:01.486 --> 24:05.530
The future of farming...or so
I'm told.

24:06.538 --> 24:09.533
I might have been misinformed.
Beware the farmers' market.

24:09.534 --> 24:11.545
You're
more likely to find an honest broker

24:11.546 --> 24:13.518
at the door of a Turkish bordello.

24:14.538 --> 24:18.542
Unfortunately, this isn't a social
call. I have a favour to ask of you.

24:20.489 --> 24:25.484
Someone, and we believe we know who,
has sabotaged our wagons.

24:25.485 --> 24:26.544
I cannot get my produce to market.

24:26.545 --> 24:29.528
And the wholesale price of grain is
falling even as we speak.

24:29.529 --> 24:31.508
Might it be possible for you

24:31.509 --> 24:34.524
to spare us two or three wagons so
that I might...

24:34.525 --> 24:36.504
Of course, Mrs Appleby, of course.

24:36.505 --> 24:38.564
I'll have the vehicles brought round
to you this evening.

24:38.565 --> 24:42.577
Thank you, Mr Payne. My husband will
be most grateful.

24:56.520 --> 24:57.528
Alice!

25:06.568 --> 25:08.484
Alice!

25:10.528 --> 25:12.488
Alice.

25:21.519 --> 25:22.531
Alice!

25:27.523 --> 25:29.527
CAWING

25:32.507 --> 25:34.555
CAWING

25:44.539 --> 25:45.547
Alice?

25:55.502 --> 25:56.506
Alice?

26:12.530 --> 26:13.570
HOOVES TROT

26:45.568 --> 26:48.484
DOORS CREAK

26:50.548 --> 26:51.556
Gwen?

27:10.560 --> 27:12.484
Martha?

27:13.544 --> 27:15.476
It's my fault.

27:17.479 --> 27:18.515
All my fault.

27:21.499 --> 27:24.538
Last night, Alice told me she was
going to elope with Jack.

27:24.539 --> 27:26.566
SHE BREATHES HARD

27:26.567 --> 27:28.514
I couldn't allow that.

27:28.515 --> 27:30.539
I lost my temper.

27:31.543 --> 27:33.479
I shouted at her.

27:34.479 --> 27:35.547
I went too far.

27:38.535 --> 27:40.507
Go on, Martha. What happened?

27:44.503 --> 27:48.535
When I went back there this morning
to apologise to her, Alice had gone.

27:50.566 --> 27:52.526
I was foolish.

27:54.490 --> 27:57.538
Had I not tried to intervene, she
would have overcome her infatuation.

27:59.474 --> 28:00.554
If anything should happen to her...

28:02.534 --> 28:04.482
If Jack Langtree should...

28:15.553 --> 28:16.557
'It's my fault.'

28:18.553 --> 28:22.533
I drove her to him.
You did what you thought was best.

28:35.541 --> 28:37.520
'But she's lost, Mrs Appleby.'

28:37.521 --> 28:39.493
We've lost her.

28:46.476 --> 28:48.552
Tell me more about Alice.

29:32.479 --> 29:34.482
'People in the village
couldn't understand'

29:34.483 --> 29:36.478
that a schoolteacher
might form a friendship

29:36.479 --> 29:39.470
with someone of Alice's
supposedly lowly situation.

29:39.471 --> 29:45.517
But this place, Shepzoy, this whole
county, it's so medieval,

29:45.518 --> 29:47.558
so provincial.

29:49.522 --> 29:51.482
I'm sorry.

29:52.550 --> 29:54.553
I'm too easily aroused to
passion. No, please.

29:54.554 --> 29:56.557
I think the world would be
a better place

29:56.558 --> 29:59.470
if more of us were passionate,
don't you?

30:03.478 --> 30:04.526
Yes.

30:09.538 --> 30:11.534
I do.

30:13.514 --> 30:15.514
Are you all right?

30:16.529 --> 30:18.472
Ma'am?

30:18.473 --> 30:21.489
Er...Mr Payne from Marshfield
is outside.

30:23.481 --> 30:25.469
Excuse me.

30:37.505 --> 30:40.476
You'll have your produce sold
by the weekend, I'm sure of it.

30:40.477 --> 30:43.561
Thank you, Mr Payne. I can't tell
you how grateful we are.

30:49.564 --> 30:51.531
Please, Charlotte, go back inside.

30:51.532 --> 30:55.515
Oh, my God. That's Alice Wharton.
Martha's friend.

30:55.516 --> 30:58.515
I know her. She's one of my workers.

30:58.516 --> 31:03.467
William Payne, the new proprietor
of Marshfield Estate.

31:03.468 --> 31:04.556
What happened?

31:06.492 --> 31:08.495
I need your assistance, Mr Payne.

31:08.496 --> 31:09.511
Well, of course.

31:09.512 --> 31:11.547
This young woman was
murdered in Elmwood Forest.

31:11.548 --> 31:15.484
The man I believe responsible, Jack
Langtree, is still there.

31:15.485 --> 31:17.526
He's living in the cave
at the Devil's Chapel.

31:17.527 --> 31:19.506
Your men will know where that is.

31:19.507 --> 31:23.498
I need you and your men to go up
there and apprehend Langtree.

31:23.499 --> 31:25.546
Of course. We'll start the search at
first light.

31:25.547 --> 31:28.554
Thank you, Mr Payne. What happened?

31:28.555 --> 31:31.531
Let's go. Not now,
Charlotte, please.

31:34.539 --> 31:35.543
Martha.

31:59.482 --> 32:01.550
Take Martha back inside
the house, Charlotte.

32:06.534 --> 32:09.561
What do you intend to do?
Examine her body thoroughly.

32:09.562 --> 32:12.541
Why? What happened
in those woods, Nathan?

32:12.542 --> 32:15.514
Please, Charlotte, do as I ask.

33:22.551 --> 33:24.519
CLOTH RIPS

33:34.475 --> 33:35.547
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

33:58.526 --> 34:00.494
SHE SCREAMS
Oh!

34:30.481 --> 34:31.529
Oh, my...

34:37.496 --> 34:38.513
Where's Martha?

34:44.536 --> 34:47.531
Martha, we need to talk.
What's going on?

34:47.532 --> 34:50.495
The results of my examination
of Alice's body are...

34:50.496 --> 34:51.554
HE LAUGHS SHAKILY

34:51.556 --> 34:55.552
I am absolutely certain beyond
all doubt...

34:58.552 --> 35:00.544
..Alice was murdered early
this morning.

35:01.548 --> 35:06.528
Now, we saw Alice in Elmwood Forest
some time around midday.

35:10.516 --> 35:12.487
And I did not imagine it, Charlotte.

35:12.488 --> 35:15.496
Martha can corroborate
the truth of our encounter

35:15.497 --> 35:17.531
with what I can only describe
as Alice's spirit.

35:21.511 --> 35:22.515
We saw her.

35:23.511 --> 35:27.543
We saw her as clearly
as we can see you.

35:31.459 --> 35:32.499
Martha?

35:41.543 --> 35:44.459
I'm sorry, Mr Appleby.

35:45.550 --> 35:47.546
I don't know what you're
talking about.

35:49.486 --> 35:50.497
What?

35:50.498 --> 35:52.537
I didn't see Alice in the woods
today.

35:52.538 --> 35:55.490
Perhaps you imagined it.

36:02.554 --> 36:04.466
What the hell...

36:05.506 --> 36:07.469
..are you playing at?

36:07.470 --> 36:09.501
You're frightening me, Mr Appleby.
Dammit!

36:09.502 --> 36:11.529
You saw her!

36:11.530 --> 36:12.534
We both saw her!

36:13.546 --> 36:17.482
Why are you lying?
Why are you lying? Nathan! Nathan!

36:18.513 --> 36:20.513
I apologise for my husband's
behaviour.

36:34.461 --> 36:36.513
She's lying, Charlotte.

36:37.545 --> 36:40.520
I don't know why she's lying
but she is lying.

36:40.521 --> 36:44.457
You've been locked away in your
study, locked away in yourself.

36:44.458 --> 36:47.455
Doing what, Nathan? Trying to raise
the dead? What about the living?

36:47.456 --> 36:50.456
Please. Please, Charlotte.
I saw Alice.

36:51.472 --> 36:54.460
I saw her. Stop it! Stop this now.

36:55.460 --> 36:57.468
I can't stop it!

36:58.540 --> 37:01.464
God help me! I see the dead!

37:02.536 --> 37:04.543
And I have to understand
why this is happening.

37:04.544 --> 37:07.483
Then you're a fool, Nathan.

37:07.484 --> 37:09.479
If these things you see and
hear really exist,

37:09.480 --> 37:10.507
do you think there are rules?

37:10.508 --> 37:11.527
Why should there be rules?

37:11.528 --> 37:13.544
Why should there be a scientific
explanation?

37:14.543 --> 37:18.466
Because if there isn't, I'm
going mad. This must stop.

37:18.467 --> 37:21.502
Don't you think I've wanted to
stop, but whichever way I turn

37:21.503 --> 37:25.466
the dead are there?! Voices,
visions. I'm trying to protect you.

37:25.467 --> 37:26.502
From what? I don't know.

37:26.503 --> 37:29.542
I don't know what any of this means.
I saw Alice today after she died.

37:29.543 --> 37:32.454
I saw Clarity Winlove.
I saw her here.

37:32.455 --> 37:34.546
I saw her in this house, in our
bedroom. Her hand upon you here.

37:34.547 --> 37:37.502
"You will reap what has been sown."
Her words. Nathan.

37:37.503 --> 37:40.490
I have to know what she meant. Was
it a blessing? Was it a curse?

37:40.491 --> 37:43.486
A threat? I don't know, but I have
to know. I have to understand.

37:43.487 --> 37:45.535
There must be a meaning to all these
things and I have to...

37:45.536 --> 37:47.538
You never told me about
this visitation.

37:48.538 --> 37:50.545
I will not play a part
in your madness.

37:50.546 --> 37:52.490
Charlotte.

37:53.506 --> 37:54.509
Charlotte.

37:54.510 --> 37:58.474
I have given you everything,
everything I have!

37:59.474 --> 38:00.510
And you've abandoned me!

38:01.546 --> 38:03.530

..may the Cross of the Son of God,

..and more glorious

41:55.470 --> 41:57.474
..at all times and in all places...

42:00.494 --> 42:03.478
..may it protect and defend you...

42:06.514 --> 42:09.490
..from the wrath of evildoers...

42:11.458 --> 42:13.510
..from the assaults
of evil spirits...

42:14.529 --> 42:18.497
..from foes visible and invisible...

42:20.453 --> 42:22.517
..from the snares of the Devil...

42:25.469 --> 42:28.485
..from all passions that beguile
the soul and body.

42:30.541 --> 42:35.449
May the Cross of the Son of
God guard...

42:38.533 --> 42:40.473
..protect...

42:42.489 --> 42:45.445
..and deliver you.

42:51.508 --> 42:52.539
Amen.

42:52.540 --> 42:54.524
CONGREGATION: Amen.

43:03.532 --> 43:06.496
That's him, sir! Yeah, that's
him! There he is!

43:07.504 --> 43:08.535
GUNSHOT
What in God's name...

43:08.536 --> 43:11.455
I want Jack alive! I had no
intention of hitting him.

43:11.456 --> 43:13.508
It was just a warning shot.
I'm sorry! I want him unharmed!

43:18.463 --> 43:20.522
If Jack Langtree's hanging round
here and threatening us,

43:20.523 --> 43:22.531
he'll have me to reckon with.

43:23.527 --> 43:25.535
Thank you, Gwen.

43:26.531 --> 43:29.495
I'm sure Mr Appleby will keep
us safe.

43:30.507 --> 43:33.462
Where is Miss Enderby?

43:33.463 --> 43:36.463
She's in her room, ma'am.
I heard her lock her door.

43:40.491 --> 43:41.527
Jack!

43:45.518 --> 43:46.526
Jack!

43:48.470 --> 43:51.458
Jack, stop! Stop, Jack!

43:54.514 --> 43:56.450
Jack!

44:06.498 --> 44:07.502
Jack!

44:10.450 --> 44:11.470
Jack.

44:20.517 --> 44:22.521
It's you, Mr Appleby, innit?

44:23.521 --> 44:26.461
What? All these goings-on.

44:29.481 --> 44:33.501
And there's old Jack...
trying to lift the curse...

44:34.501 --> 44:36.461
...and save the harvest...

44:37.493 --> 44:39.473
..and it's old Jack that you
banish...

44:42.461 --> 44:46.455
..turn to a bloody animal and now
you're going to have old Jack hung

44:46.456 --> 44:47.527
for what happened to Alice.

44:47.528 --> 44:49.468
CAWING

44:54.480 --> 44:55.484
She were...

44:57.500 --> 44:58.536
..she were...

45:00.444 --> 45:01.460
..my angel.

45:04.468 --> 45:05.520
She were going to save me.

45:07.504 --> 45:10.463
Jack, I want you
to return to Shepzoy with me

45:10.464 --> 45:13.460
and you'll receive a fair
hearing, I promise you.

45:13.461 --> 45:15.535
I ain't interested
in your justice.

45:23.527 --> 45:26.495
All I wants... Yes?

45:28.479 --> 45:30.523
..is for you to bring her back,
Mr Appleby.

45:32.455 --> 45:33.459
Please.

45:34.475 --> 45:36.503
Please can you bring her
back to me?

45:39.475 --> 45:41.490
What? They say that you...

45:41.491 --> 45:44.491
they say that you raise
the dead, so...

45:46.514 --> 45:48.502
..can you bring her back to
me, Mr Appleby?

45:52.470 --> 45:54.534
But I'm just a man, Jack.

45:59.454 --> 46:00.470
No more.

46:01.506 --> 46:02.514
No more.

46:11.518 --> 46:13.450
Then I go where Alice goes.

46:14.525 --> 46:16.529
Jack! Jack!

46:40.485 --> 46:41.489
DOOR RATTLES

46:44.444 --> 46:45.459
KNOCK AT DOOR

46:45.460 --> 46:47.495
Martha? Open the door, please.

46:47.496 --> 46:50.475
Martha, I want to speak to you.

46:50.476 --> 46:53.523
Please, I'm fine.
I don't want to talk. I'm fine.

46:53.524 --> 46:56.444
I just want to be on my own.

46:57.440 --> 46:58.500
I want you to tell me the truth.

47:16.531 --> 47:20.499
If he wasn't guilty of Alice's
murder, then why did he run?

47:40.527 --> 47:42.503
The Language Of Flowers.

48:07.470 --> 48:10.481
I don't believe Nathan saw
Alice's ghost in the woods,

48:10.482 --> 48:12.465
but he did see something,

48:12.466 --> 48:16.444
and whatever he saw, or thinks he
saw, you saw it too,

48:16.445 --> 48:18.468
and when you denied this,
you were lying.

48:18.469 --> 48:19.477
Why?

48:33.513 --> 48:38.468
"O my love is like a red, red rose,
That's newly sprung in June..."

48:38.469 --> 48:42.465
O my love is like a red, red rose...

48:43.488 --> 48:46.455
..that's newly sprung in June...

48:46.456 --> 48:49.463
"O my love's like the melody,
That's sweetly played in tune."

48:49.464 --> 48:53.431
As fair art thou, my bonny lass...

48:53.432 --> 48:54.515
"So deep in love am I..."

48:54.516 --> 48:57.475
TOGETHER: "And I will love thee
still, my dear,

48:57.476 --> 48:59.448
"Till all the sea's gone dry.

49:08.476 --> 49:11.512
"To my secret flower of the forest.

49:14.471 --> 49:15.479
"From Martha."

49:18.475 --> 49:20.478
I loved her.

49:20.479 --> 49:23.459
The way you love your husband.

49:25.447 --> 49:26.511
But she chose Jack.

49:27.527 --> 49:30.478
This explains why he attacked
Martha Enderby.

49:30.479 --> 49:33.463
Jack loved Alice Wharton...

49:35.443 --> 49:36.459
..as did Martha.

49:40.491 --> 49:41.498
Appleby?

49:41.499 --> 49:44.457
All my life, I've felt...

49:44.458 --> 49:46.454
different...

49:47.486 --> 49:49.446
..in here...

49:51.442 --> 49:53.446
..and here.

49:54.454 --> 49:55.482
Alone.

49:56.502 --> 49:57.518
Always alone.

49:58.518 --> 50:02.470
Until...until I found Alice and...

50:04.442 --> 50:06.462
..I loved her...

50:07.462 --> 50:09.478
..with all my heart and soul.

50:15.481 --> 50:18.464
If you love me,
you wouldn't have done this.

50:18.465 --> 50:19.468
Leave me alone!

50:19.469 --> 50:22.480
Martha? Leave me alone!

50:22.481 --> 50:23.505
I need to get back.

50:41.469 --> 50:43.469
Martha?

50:44.516 --> 50:47.495
Even as a child,
they knew I was different.

50:47.496 --> 50:51.503
Treating me like I have
no feelings, no passion.

50:51.504 --> 50:56.520
They made me invisible,
because I was different.

50:57.516 --> 51:00.515
Schoolteacher. Spinster.

51:00.516 --> 51:05.447
God knows I tried to stop
myself feeling!

51:05.448 --> 51:09.515
Never to hope, never to love,
joyless, arid, alone.

51:09.516 --> 51:13.470
My books, my flowers and you.

51:13.471 --> 51:15.498
I loved you. Oh, God.

51:15.499 --> 51:17.490
How I loved you.

51:17.491 --> 51:20.442
Why did you laugh at me?

51:20.443 --> 51:22.446
In the forest.

51:22.447 --> 51:26.471
You knew I loved you
and you laughed at me! Why?

51:31.451 --> 51:33.470
SHE GASPS

51:33.471 --> 51:36.435
SHE LAUGHS

51:41.511 --> 51:43.483
SHE CHOKES

51:49.458 --> 51:50.461
SCREAMING

51:50.462 --> 51:51.465
GUNSHOT

51:51.466 --> 51:53.450
Charlotte!

51:54.478 --> 51:55.510
Charlotte!

52:02.490 --> 52:03.498
Charlotte.

52:04.506 --> 52:06.445
What happened?

52:06.446 --> 52:07.458
Charlotte?

52:25.513 --> 52:27.465
CAWING

52:37.449 --> 52:40.509
Now, Jack weren't no angel,
but it ain't right he's dead.

52:42.488 --> 52:45.520
Another one of us gone.
Where does it all end, Gideon?

52:46.520 --> 52:48.499
I don't know, Lizzie.

52:48.500 --> 52:49.516
I don't know.

52:50.516 --> 52:52.508
CAWING

53:16.491 --> 53:17.507
CREAKING

53:46.426 --> 53:47.441
Thank you, Mr Payne.

53:47.442 --> 53:50.486
Well, if there's anything else
you need, you know where I am.

54:00.450 --> 54:02.446
Right, lads.

54:12.509 --> 54:15.437
Martha murdered Alice Wharton.

54:16.493 --> 54:18.492
And no-one possessed.

54:18.493 --> 54:20.489
No demons. No devils.

54:22.513 --> 54:26.453
Just human weakness and
passion and folly.

54:30.441 --> 54:31.513
I can't remain here.

54:36.477 --> 54:37.505
Charlotte.

54:42.468 --> 54:43.508
Charlotte.

54:47.428 --> 54:48.432
I'm sorry.

54:51.420 --> 54:53.507
She tried to kill me, Nathan.
I can't stay.

54:53.508 --> 54:55.460
I can protect you.

54:56.476 --> 54:57.504
I love you.

55:02.488 --> 55:04.420
I will protect you.

55:06.468 --> 55:08.508
But can you protect our child?

55:21.439 --> 55:23.483
You're pregnant? Oh...!

55:26.427 --> 55:27.499
This is everything we wanted.

55:34.443 --> 55:37.431
This is why we came here.

55:39.487 --> 55:41.487
No, nothing else matters.

55:43.418 --> 55:44.510
No, nothing else matters but this.

55:53.514 --> 55:56.418
WHISPERS: The past is dead.

55:58.426 --> 56:00.458
And the dead are dead.

56:04.486 --> 56:07.438
There is only us three.

56:46.416 --> 56:47.468
You want to go in tonight?

56:48.512 --> 56:50.448
BABY CRIES

57:06.416 --> 57:09.447
She is the thread that is tying
everything together.

57:09.448 --> 57:10.464
I'm certain of it.

57:12.419 --> 57:13.475
Gabriel?

57:15.495 --> 57:18.459
Is everyone ready? ALL: Yeah.

57:22.507 --> 57:24.451
THUD

57:26.443 --> 57:28.491
Three, two, one.

57:30.020 --> 57:32.088
MAN SCREAMS

57:34.008 --> 57:38.055
# I must go away, she said

57:38.056 --> 57:43.007
# When the little cock does crow

57:43.008 --> 57:44.095
# For here

57:44.096 --> 57:50.079
# They will not let me stay

57:50.080 --> 57:53.055
# This night

57:53.056 --> 57:59.052
# Should be never, never day. #
