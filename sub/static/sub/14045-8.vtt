WEBVTT

00:03.505 --> 00:05.866
All right, Mayweather. Where'd
you learn to punch like that?

00:06.306 --> 00:08.609
Golden Gloves, from 8 to 18.

00:09.312 --> 00:11.362
Y'all need to come
chew on some of this iron.

00:11.363 --> 00:14.184
Get some grown-man muscles,
not those "Body by Jake"

00:14.185 --> 00:15.999
Cardio-Kickboxing"
bodies y'all working with.

00:16.001 --> 00:18.305
- Yeah, is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

00:18.621 --> 00:19.638
Oh, that's funny.

00:19.716 --> 00:25.358
See, now, look, I don't mess with
none of that Zumba/pilates/spin B.S.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.034
This is a grown-ass-man workout.

00:27.035 --> 00:29.185
And for real, I'm gonna
start charging y'all for this.

00:29.672 --> 00:31.811
People should have to pay to see this.

00:31.812 --> 00:33.505
Yeah, I-I think you're right.

00:33.538 --> 00:34.595
Smart move.

00:34.596 --> 00:36.865
- Get him!
- Let's get him to the break room!

00:36.898 --> 00:38.497
Did you tell T.C. you wanted to move?

00:38.530 --> 00:40.801
Yeah, but you know T.C. I
mean, he's not a real planner.

00:40.834 --> 00:42.049
He's more "go with the flow."

00:42.082 --> 00:43.082
Yeah, I guess.

00:43.753 --> 00:45.611
So... what is this?

00:45.612 --> 00:46.849
I...

00:48.002 --> 00:49.546
- Give me my shorts.
- Ladies, ladies, ladies.

00:49.570 --> 00:51.361
Kenny says we got to pay to display,

00:51.394 --> 00:53.066
- so this one's on me.
- Give me my shorts!

00:53.090 --> 00:54.684
- Ooh-ah! Ooh-ah!
- What, do you mean these?

00:54.684 --> 00:56.272
Give... give me ...I will kill you.

00:56.273 --> 00:58.081
- Nice grown-ass-man muscles.
- I really...

00:58.114 --> 00:59.208
Give me, give me my friggin' shorts!

00:59.209 --> 01:00.449
Tee, strike a pose.

01:00.482 --> 01:01.505
Ha ha ha.

01:02.882 --> 01:05.473
If H.R. asks, I was not here.

01:05.506 --> 01:07.521
Not a word.

01:07.554 --> 01:09.665
So, uh, you want to get a better look?

01:09.698 --> 01:12.138
- I'm good. Nothing I haven't seen.
- Give me my friggin' shorts...

01:12.162 --> 01:13.441
Oh, you naughty girl.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.415
- I didn't mean to. It just got heated,
- Uh-huh.

01:15.416 --> 01:16.410
- And...
- Uh-huh.

01:16.411 --> 01:18.046
I hadn't had any in like a year.

01:18.047 --> 01:19.069
Okay.

01:21.602 --> 01:22.529
Oh, I'm gonna get you!

01:22.562 --> 01:24.010
I kind of wish I hadn't, though,

01:24.011 --> 01:25.832
'cause I don't want him to see
me as just a hookup, you know?

01:25.833 --> 01:27.898
No! Come on, you're just gonna...

01:27.899 --> 01:29.060
Oh, hey, Krista.

01:29.061 --> 01:30.307
Hey, Jordan. Gwen.

01:30.308 --> 01:31.177
Hey, what's up, Krista?

01:31.178 --> 01:32.195
- Hey!
- Not much.

01:32.674 --> 01:34.816
Huh. Wow. Did she hear that?

01:34.850 --> 01:36.961
I'm glad everybody's having a good time.

01:36.993 --> 01:38.977
- Oh! That's right.
- Hey, guys?

01:39.010 --> 01:41.345
Shift starts in five minutes.
We already have incoming.

01:41.378 --> 01:42.465
Come on. Let's go.

01:42.497 --> 01:43.497
Okay.

01:44.588 --> 01:47.029
- Oh-oh-oh.
- Give-to-me, oh...

01:48.467 --> 01:50.901
Oh! Mm-hm.

01:51.842 --> 01:53.383
Hey. What's your name, sir?

01:53.383 --> 01:56.417
Christian Boone. Call me Boone. I'm
just having a little trouble breathing.

01:56.418 --> 01:58.346
All right. Well, we're
gonna take good care of you.

01:58.370 --> 01:59.914
- Why don't you hop on over here?
- Yeah.

01:59.938 --> 02:01.673
- You having any chest pain?
- Yeah, a little.

02:01.697 --> 02:04.126
All right, we'll run a few tests
and see what's going on with you.

02:04.127 --> 02:06.816
Mollie, can we get a blood
panel, CBC, and an EKG?

02:06.817 --> 02:08.133
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

02:14.338 --> 02:16.929
- You gonna post those?
- You know I am.

02:16.961 --> 02:19.105
I love this phone...
takes amazing pictures.

02:19.138 --> 02:21.025
I got my daughter the same one as a reward

02:21.058 --> 02:23.009
for getting straight A's last semester.

02:23.042 --> 02:24.097
Lucky you.

02:24.130 --> 02:26.401
My son's favorite subjects
are lunch and recess.

02:26.434 --> 02:28.961
I don't see a scholarship in our future.

02:28.994 --> 02:30.049
Or a phone in his.

02:30.082 --> 02:31.137
Topher?

02:31.170 --> 02:32.577
You've got a call.

02:32.610 --> 02:34.295
Michael, you need parenting advice,

02:34.308 --> 02:36.666
you know where to find
me. Father of the year.

02:36.667 --> 02:37.667
Thanks, Jocelyn.

02:37.922 --> 02:39.146
Secret texts to a new girlfriend?

02:39.170 --> 02:40.769
Oh, uh, no.

02:40.802 --> 02:43.169
The... the father of my patient
that just passed... Oren.

02:43.202 --> 02:44.321
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:44.354 --> 02:45.708
That was the radiation guy, right?

02:45.732 --> 02:46.732
Yeah.

02:46.865 --> 02:47.969
He was so sweet.

02:49.026 --> 02:50.209
Yeah.

02:50.242 --> 02:52.513
Anyways, that's the, uh,
that's the job, right?

02:52.546 --> 02:53.505
Have to move on.

02:53.537 --> 02:54.657
Still doesn't make it easy.

02:58.350 --> 03:00.641
So, you ready for your surgical rotation?

03:00.674 --> 03:01.985
Yeah, yeah.

03:02.018 --> 03:03.521
Been, uh, been studying hard.

03:03.554 --> 03:05.418
Have to keep up the family
name, so my dad says.

03:05.442 --> 03:08.163
Scott says your dad's already called
three times to find out what you're doing.

03:08.164 --> 03:09.929
Yeah, it'll be 20 before the week's over.

03:09.930 --> 03:11.595
Good luck following the last
surgical intern, 'cause I

03:11.596 --> 03:13.600
hear she pretty much killed it.

03:13.634 --> 03:15.978
Oh, oh, you mean the one that
made out with her attending, right?

03:16.002 --> 03:17.025
- That... that one.
- Hmm.

03:17.058 --> 03:18.113
Okay. Okay.

03:18.145 --> 03:19.745
When's that gonna die?

03:19.778 --> 03:21.121
Attention, everybody!

03:21.154 --> 03:22.721
I just got off the phone with dispatch.

03:22.754 --> 03:24.577
We have a building collapse downtown.

03:24.610 --> 03:26.402
We are gonna be the major receiving.

03:26.403 --> 03:28.449
- Estimated number of casualties?
- Up to 50.

03:28.482 --> 03:30.721
They're requesting that
E.R. personnel get triage

03:30.754 --> 03:32.065
up and running on-site.

03:32.097 --> 03:33.569
I'm on it. Drew, you're with me.

03:33.602 --> 03:35.680
Anyone wants a ride, train leaves now.

03:39.643 --> 03:41.825
Okay, Boone. Uh...

03:41.858 --> 03:44.961
Well, the good news is, it's
not an acute heart attack.

03:46.337 --> 03:47.456
But here's the thing.

03:47.490 --> 03:49.057
Oh. There's always a thing.

03:49.378 --> 03:50.583
Yeah.

03:50.919 --> 03:53.385
There could be some
underlying heart disease.

03:53.386 --> 03:55.794
And I'm concerned about your symptoms.

03:55.795 --> 03:58.354
You fainted, so we need to find out why.

03:58.355 --> 04:00.609
Have you been under any stress lately?

04:00.641 --> 04:02.849
Who isn't
under stress these days?

04:02.882 --> 04:04.193
Right, right.

04:04.225 --> 04:06.598
Look, I want to keep you here
overnight for observation.

04:06.604 --> 04:08.257
Better to be safe than sorry.

04:08.290 --> 04:10.030
Doctor, I'm sorry to interrupt,

04:10.031 --> 04:11.673
but there's been an explosion in Southtown.

04:11.674 --> 04:12.906
- It's a mass casualty.
- Southtown?

04:12.930 --> 04:14.017
That's where my diner is.

04:14.050 --> 04:15.847
- I have to go. My goddaughter works there.
- No, no you don't.

04:15.848 --> 04:17.579
- No, no, no, no.
- You need to stay here and rest.

04:17.579 --> 04:18.627
No, I have to find out if she's okay.

04:18.628 --> 04:21.127
Sir, you couldn't get downtown if
you tried. It's been zoned off, okay?

04:21.128 --> 04:22.279
- Well, th-then I have to call her.
- Just relax.

04:22.280 --> 04:23.754
Of course. We understand. Okay, look.

04:23.755 --> 04:26.144
If you start to feel funny,
you tell Nurse Mollie,

04:26.145 --> 04:28.320
I'll come back and check on you, okay?

04:29.355 --> 04:30.656
- You've got your phone?
- Yeah.

04:30.690 --> 04:32.511
- Okay. Thank you, Mollie.
- Yeah.

04:34.220 --> 04:36.001
Topher. Hey. Where are we?

04:36.034 --> 04:37.295
I've talked to all departments.

04:37.296 --> 04:38.817
We've activated disaster protocol.

04:38.818 --> 04:40.124
Scott and Paul are prepping O.R.s.

04:40.125 --> 04:41.216
I pulled the disaster kits.

04:41.217 --> 04:43.840
All right. Triage everyone. Red
tag... critical, yellow... urgent,

04:43.841 --> 04:45.654
- green... walking wounded, black... D.O.A.
- Got it.

04:45.655 --> 04:47.114
- You know what? I'll help you prep.
- Yes, thank you!

04:47.138 --> 04:48.717
Kenny! How's that waiting room looking?

04:48.718 --> 04:50.486
Cleared and ready for the walking wounded.

04:50.487 --> 04:52.536
Grabbed all the O-neg
I could get my hands on.

04:52.537 --> 04:53.807
We're gonna need more than that.

04:53.808 --> 04:56.066
Everybody, be on your
toes! It's gonna be messy.

04:56.067 --> 04:57.134
Joce, did you get T.C.?

04:57.135 --> 04:58.510
Yeah. He just arrived on-site.

04:58.511 --> 04:59.886
Tee, tell me something good.

05:00.029 --> 05:02.465
If I did, I'd be lying to you, brother.

05:02.498 --> 05:05.409
- How bad are we talking?
- It's gonna be a long night.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.074

05:24.530 --> 05:25.691
Let's roll him on three.

05:25.724 --> 05:27.617
One, two, three.

05:28.699 --> 05:31.497
Rigid abdomen. BP 90 systolic, pulse 120.

05:31.498 --> 05:32.702
I'm worried about a hot belly.

05:32.703 --> 05:34.302
I saw him. He saved me.

05:34.336 --> 05:35.326
Who saved you, sir?

05:35.359 --> 05:39.262
My guardian angel. He's as big as an ox.

05:39.295 --> 05:42.270
He saved me, pulled me from death.

05:42.303 --> 05:43.971
I hear you. I hear you.
Let's get him out of here.

05:43.972 --> 05:45.218
An intra-abdominal bleed.

05:45.219 --> 05:46.855
Let's red-tag him for a
straight shot to the O.R.

05:46.879 --> 05:47.806
Yeah.

05:47.839 --> 05:48.935
All right. Gwennie, what do we got?

05:48.959 --> 05:50.292
Male in his 20s.

05:50.293 --> 05:52.958
14-centimeter full-thickness
laceration to his left forearm.

05:52.991 --> 05:54.284
He's lost a lot of blood.

05:54.285 --> 05:55.719
Somebody used a belt as a tourniquet.

05:55.743 --> 05:57.534
- You didn't do that?
- No, it wasn't me.

05:57.568 --> 05:59.230
It'll probably save his life.

05:59.263 --> 06:01.726
Hey, take a look at his
forehead. What is that, a cross?

06:01.759 --> 06:03.913
No, it's not a cross. It's a "t."

06:03.914 --> 06:06.993
Writing a "t" in a patient's blood is
military shorthand for "tourniquet."

06:06.994 --> 06:08.222
We got us a medic out here.

06:08.255 --> 06:09.630
- Hey, Tee!
- Yeah?

06:09.663 --> 06:11.359
- Go on. I got this.
- All right.

06:11.391 --> 06:14.152
I got a closed mid-shaft tibia fracture.

06:14.153 --> 06:16.945
I started two large-bore
I.V.s of LR wide open,

06:16.946 --> 06:19.149
going to titrate morphine
for pain of three.

06:19.150 --> 06:20.126
Nice splint, Drew.

06:20.160 --> 06:21.534
It was on him when I got here.

06:21.567 --> 06:23.806
Someone's getting to the injured
faster than we are.

06:23.807 --> 06:26.271
Think I have a good idea who that might be.

06:26.303 --> 06:27.518
Guy with the hat.

06:34.378 --> 06:35.378
Got it!

06:36.462 --> 06:37.577
All right. Let's get a dressing on it,

06:37.578 --> 06:38.643
- okay?
- Okay.

06:39.327 --> 06:41.482
How many suture packs have
you gone through tonight?

06:41.483 --> 06:42.621
I stopped counting at 50.

06:42.622 --> 06:44.496
At this pace, we're gonna run
out of those and blood.

06:44.520 --> 06:45.974
I got Ragosa starting a blood bank.

06:45.975 --> 06:47.772
I'll have him replenish
the other supplies, too.

06:47.773 --> 06:50.474
8 red tags, 13 yellow. A dozen
green. We've had two D.O.A.s.

06:50.475 --> 06:52.956
All surgery teams upstairs are working,
but every department's getting buried.

06:52.957 --> 06:54.590
And lots of families for missing people.

06:54.623 --> 06:56.630
Hey-hey, Kenny, we need you to run point

06:56.631 --> 06:58.237
and get an accurate count of the missing.

06:58.238 --> 06:58.660
Got it.

06:58.661 --> 06:59.907
All right, I'm gonna
check on my heart patient.

06:59.908 --> 07:01.100
Page me for the next trauma.

07:01.101 --> 07:02.060
Keep digging in, people.

07:02.061 --> 07:03.757
Oh hey, guys. I got this.

07:03.758 --> 07:05.586
Did you hear about my guardian angel?

07:05.586 --> 07:06.886
He carried me out.

07:06.887 --> 07:09.222
I'm... I'm gonna have to
wait for the movie, sir.

07:09.662 --> 07:10.590
Hey, Paul.

07:10.622 --> 07:12.216
Your next surgery.

07:12.808 --> 07:14.182
Paul!

07:14.900 --> 07:16.883
Dad? What are you
what are you doing here?

07:16.904 --> 07:17.831
Hello, Paul.

07:17.832 --> 07:19.088
I told you not to come, Dad.

07:19.089 --> 07:20.196
This is my first night of surgery.

07:20.197 --> 07:22.322
Nonsense. That's exactly why I did come.

07:22.323 --> 07:24.006
You think I'd miss your first night?

07:24.007 --> 07:25.601
Dr. Cummings. Huge honor.

07:25.602 --> 07:27.801
I'm Dr. Zia, Paul's attending
and night-shift chief.

07:27.876 --> 07:28.876
Oh, of course.

07:28.954 --> 07:30.688
I-I was in Austin giving a lecture.

07:30.751 --> 07:31.870
Decided I'd swing by.

07:31.903 --> 07:33.956
On any other night, we would
roll out the red carpet.

07:33.957 --> 07:34.957
But as you can see...

07:34.993 --> 07:36.048
I-I understand.

07:36.159 --> 07:37.809
I'll just make myself busy down here.

07:37.810 --> 07:39.249
Paul, I'll talk to you later.

07:39.442 --> 07:40.442
Don't let me down.

07:44.031 --> 07:45.630
He's good. I've already checked him.

07:45.631 --> 07:48.178
Set another I.V. on the
way in. Come on, let's go.

07:51.327 --> 07:53.310
Thanks, guys. I've got it from here.

07:56.127 --> 07:57.278
What do we got there?

07:57.310 --> 07:59.614
Just wrapping a broken wrist.

07:59.647 --> 08:00.958
What's your name?

08:00.990 --> 08:02.974
Bennett. James Bennett.

08:03.007 --> 08:03.663
I was nearby.

08:03.664 --> 08:05.869
I heard an explosion, came
over to see what happened.

08:05.870 --> 08:07.442
So you pulled an old man out of the rubble?

08:07.466 --> 08:08.760
Tourniquet on an arm?

08:08.849 --> 08:10.293
Splint another man's leg.

08:10.750 --> 08:13.260
Oh, man, I'm sorry if I overstepped.

08:13.261 --> 08:14.400
I was just trying to help out.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.287
Don't apologize. Army medic, right?

08:16.543 --> 08:18.558
Yes, sir... two tours in Afghanistan.

08:19.327 --> 08:20.797
Looks like it's our lucky night.

08:20.831 --> 08:22.391
You're an off-duty paramedic?

08:22.431 --> 08:24.655
I'm not a paramedic. I wish I was, though.

08:24.663 --> 08:26.423
I just can't get on any of the crews.

08:26.687 --> 08:28.094
How long you been trying?

08:28.126 --> 08:29.256
More than a year.

08:29.535 --> 08:31.101
They said I had to take an EMT course,

08:31.135 --> 08:33.735
but, you know, that's 10 grand
for a cheap one. I don't have that.

08:34.111 --> 08:36.126
They won't transfer
over your medic service?

08:36.158 --> 08:37.575
Guy like you would be an asset to them.

08:37.599 --> 08:39.230
You've done this stuff under fire.

08:39.263 --> 08:41.373
Uh, yes, sir. They said
I had to start over.

08:41.407 --> 08:45.086
I don't mind. I'll do whatever it
takes. I just don't have the cash.

08:45.123 --> 08:47.383
Hey, Doc! We got another one!

08:47.418 --> 08:49.785
Hey, look. Your service counts
with us, all right?

08:50.239 --> 08:51.773
We're a little shorthanded tonight.

08:51.774 --> 08:53.350
Do you mind sticking around, helping out?

08:53.351 --> 08:54.597
Of course. Anything.

08:54.598 --> 08:57.878
Yeah yeah, see all those green tags over
there? Start treating the walking wounded.

08:58.241 --> 09:00.022
You're gonna be all right.
They're gonna take care of you.

09:00.023 --> 09:01.191
Over here.

09:01.863 --> 09:05.315
Look, there's a battle sign, anisocoria.
Left pupil bigger than the right...

09:05.316 --> 09:07.360
Bring her to Gwen. Tell Gwen
to bring her straight to Jordan.

09:07.361 --> 09:09.135
Possible TBI to the basilar skull fracture.

09:09.734 --> 09:10.558
Got it.

09:10.591 --> 09:12.062
You're still a bit tachycardic.

09:12.094 --> 09:13.863
My goddaughter still
hasn't answered her phone.

09:13.887 --> 09:14.937
I'm sure she's fine.

09:14.938 --> 09:18.222
But you do need to try to
relax as much as possible.

09:18.294 --> 09:20.079
I will be back soon to check on you.

09:20.131 --> 09:21.131
Okay.

09:23.314 --> 09:24.854
Oh. Excuse me.

09:27.871 --> 09:29.112
So, if you're wondering,

09:29.113 --> 09:32.280
"is that world-renowned
neurosurgeon Dr. Julian Cummings

09:32.281 --> 09:34.229
working triage in my E.R.?"...

09:34.600 --> 09:36.126
your eyes do not deceive you.

09:36.159 --> 09:39.221
Come on... did he come here to watch
Paul on his first night of surgery?

09:39.365 --> 09:40.925
Talk about putting pressure on the kid.

09:41.023 --> 09:43.038
Night like this, I'll take
all the help we can get.

09:43.039 --> 09:43.432
Yeah.

09:43.445 --> 09:46.459
This gentleman kept
talking about his guardian angel

09:46.460 --> 09:47.706
before we put him under.

09:47.707 --> 09:49.997
I'm starting to think he
might just actually have one.

09:50.078 --> 09:51.197
Okay.

09:51.231 --> 09:54.179
Removing the perforated ischemic intestine.

09:55.935 --> 09:58.238
Paul, tie off that blood vessel for me.

09:58.270 --> 09:59.270
Yeah, of course.

10:07.391 --> 10:08.414
One-handed?

10:08.447 --> 10:10.334
I'll have to tell your dad about that...

10:10.367 --> 10:12.203
assuming he's the one who taught you.

10:12.204 --> 10:15.095
Yeah, well, some dads teach
their sons to play catch.

10:15.192 --> 10:17.815
Others teach their sons
to tie surgical knots.

10:17.847 --> 10:19.079
Guess which one I had.

10:20.742 --> 10:21.989
Incoming!

10:22.363 --> 10:23.387
Jordan?

10:23.426 --> 10:25.253
Female, 20s. Red-tag head trauma.

10:25.254 --> 10:27.076
T.C. said possible traumatic brain injury

10:27.077 --> 10:28.414
and basilar skull fracture.

10:28.446 --> 10:30.330
She's been in and out of
consciousness on the ride over.

10:30.331 --> 10:31.538
What's your name, sweetie?

10:31.989 --> 10:32.624
Alex.

10:32.625 --> 10:33.961
Okay, Alex. You stay with me, okay?

10:33.962 --> 10:35.489
That's her! That's my goddaughter!

10:35.490 --> 10:36.963
- Oh, my God! Alex!
- Sir, you can't be in here.

10:36.964 --> 10:38.625
- Alex! Alex! Alex!
- It's okay. He's my patient.

10:38.626 --> 10:40.024
- He can talk to her from there.
- All right.

10:40.048 --> 10:42.890
On three. One, two, three.

10:44.086 --> 10:45.876
- Uncle Boone?
- Yeah.

10:45.910 --> 10:46.965
Is that you?

10:46.997 --> 10:48.020
It's me, sweetie.

10:48.053 --> 10:49.413
I'm here for you.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.500
BP's falling.

10:52.534 --> 10:54.453
I need a chem panel and
a CBC. Cross and type.

10:54.485 --> 10:56.305
I was so worried about you.

10:58.390 --> 10:59.413
Oh, God.

10:59.445 --> 11:01.030
Oh, God. Where are you? What's happening?

11:01.031 --> 11:02.100
Alex?

11:02.134 --> 11:04.542
- Talk to me. What's going on?
- I can't... I can't see anything.

11:04.566 --> 11:06.045
- Talk to me. Talk to me.
- I can't see. I can't see!

11:06.046 --> 11:06.773
Do something!

11:06.805 --> 11:08.180
- Uncle, help me!
- Alex!

11:08.213 --> 11:09.934
- Get him out!
- Let me help her!

11:09.935 --> 11:12.380
- We're gonna take care of her, all right?
- Alex.

11:16.217 --> 11:18.681
Okay, Alex. We're gonna
figure out what's going on.

11:18.714 --> 11:20.889
Kenny here is gonna take
you to C.T., all right?

11:20.921 --> 11:22.231
I'm right here, Alex.

11:22.243 --> 11:23.879
Look, I'll be with you the whole way.

11:23.880 --> 11:25.862
Just say my name if
you need anything, okay?

11:25.863 --> 11:26.863
Okay.

11:26.968 --> 11:28.247
Uncle Boone, are you there?

11:28.248 --> 11:29.592
I'm right here, baby.

11:29.625 --> 11:31.256
I'm scared.

11:31.288 --> 11:32.695
You let them take you, okay?

11:32.729 --> 11:34.257
They're gonna fix you up real good.

11:34.258 --> 11:36.893
Priority to C.T. scan. There could
be bleeding in her occipital lobe.

11:36.894 --> 11:38.653
Ah, front of the line we go.

11:40.216 --> 11:41.624
I got no pulse!

11:47.448 --> 11:49.111
He's got a pulse now.

11:49.145 --> 11:51.672
Yeah, I saw he had a
pacemaker, so I went to do a...

11:51.705 --> 11:53.688
- Precordial thump?
- Yeah. Good call.

11:53.720 --> 11:54.744
All right, 50s, male.

11:54.776 --> 11:56.105
Red tag to the E.R.

11:56.106 --> 11:57.921
Forget paramedic.
You should be a doctor.

11:57.945 --> 11:59.361
Thanks, but I'll stay with the action.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.024
I like being the first guy to help people.

12:01.048 --> 12:02.528
It's the one thing I'm really good at.

12:02.552 --> 12:04.952
Well, if you got one skill,
that's a damn good one to have.

12:04.984 --> 12:06.962
- Yellow Tag, Doc.
- All right. You got this?

12:06.963 --> 12:08.367
Okay, yeah.

12:08.537 --> 12:10.456
Adrenaline's tough to replace, huh?

12:10.488 --> 12:12.300
I was a medic in Iraq.

12:12.301 --> 12:14.241
Don't know what I'd be
doing if I wasn't a doctor.

12:14.265 --> 12:16.695
Geez, how'd you go from
being a field medic to a doc?

12:16.729 --> 12:18.785
Somewhere along the way, I
just caught a lucky break.

12:18.809 --> 12:21.482
You're like an army commercial.

12:21.483 --> 12:24.568
You know, they make it seem like
you serve and you're set for life.

12:24.601 --> 12:26.680
I still wouldn't trade
it for anything, though.

12:32.051 --> 12:34.557
Please tell me it's not like
this every night at this hospital.

12:34.558 --> 12:37.434
Well, uh, no. Mass casualty's
actually pretty rare, Dad.

12:37.435 --> 12:39.245
I'm talking about the
quality of facilities,

12:39.246 --> 12:41.219
the protocol, the inefficiencies...

12:41.220 --> 12:43.700
Look, can we... can we talk later? Okay?
I need to get this patient to surgery.

12:43.701 --> 12:46.007
Paul, look. This is simple triage.

12:46.041 --> 12:48.856
You want the most critical patient.
This is your patient.

12:48.857 --> 12:50.971
Look, I'm just trying to
follow Dr. Clemmens' orders.

12:50.972 --> 12:52.583
Then Dr. Clemmens is wrong.

12:54.169 --> 12:56.823
Paul, what's the holdup? I
need my patient in surgery.

12:56.857 --> 12:59.846
Right, um, my father and I
are having a minor difference

12:59.847 --> 13:01.487
of opinion as to whom we
should bring up to surgery.

13:01.488 --> 13:03.771
You got to be kidding me. Dr.
Cummings, I'm Dr. Clemmens.

13:03.772 --> 13:05.336
This patient is your next surgery.

13:05.368 --> 13:07.223
She was incorrectly yellow-tagged.

13:07.257 --> 13:10.615
Her crush injury is now
presenting as a distended abdomen.

13:10.649 --> 13:14.488
Consider ruptured viscus or hemoperitoneum.

13:15.576 --> 13:17.879
He's right. Paul, let's prep
this patient for surgery.

13:17.913 --> 13:19.633
Thank you for your input, Dr. Cummings.

13:19.634 --> 13:21.564
I-I-I would like to observe.

13:21.726 --> 13:23.330
How 'bout I sit in on this one?

13:23.878 --> 13:27.177
You know what, it's Paul's first night
in surgery, so I don't think it's...

13:29.497 --> 13:30.679
scrubs are right in there.

13:30.712 --> 13:31.934
Fantastic.

13:32.665 --> 13:34.072
You didn't have to say yes.

13:34.104 --> 13:36.365
Yeah, I did. He's relentless.

13:36.366 --> 13:38.209
He would have found his way
into that O.R. eventually.

13:38.233 --> 13:39.832
Hey, you. Crazy night, huh?

13:39.864 --> 13:40.864
One for the books.

13:40.888 --> 13:43.504
- I-is Alex done with her scan?
- Uh, she'll be back in five.

13:46.481 --> 13:48.256
Is this how it's gonna be between us now?

13:50.186 --> 13:52.599
I've got work to do. I'm sure you do, too.

13:53.464 --> 13:55.153
Michael. Walk with me.

13:55.384 --> 13:56.728
How are we on blood?

13:56.760 --> 13:59.780
Ah good... we just got a new shipment
in from the blood drive at Lackland.

13:59.781 --> 14:00.960
Should take us through the night.

14:00.984 --> 14:04.334
Great. I.C.U. just freed up some beds.
Let's get some patients up there ASAP.

14:04.335 --> 14:07.066
You a fan of Grumpy Cat?

14:07.599 --> 14:10.104
Makes me laugh every time.

14:10.136 --> 14:12.292
No, it's, uh... when my daughter
and I got our new phones,

14:12.293 --> 14:13.966
we somehow got stuck
sharing the same cloud,

14:13.967 --> 14:16.496
so now I'm getting her
texts every five seconds.

14:16.497 --> 14:17.982
I've just got to ask them to disconnect it.

14:17.983 --> 14:19.799
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on a second.

14:19.832 --> 14:22.913
Sharing that cloud gives you
complete insight into her world.

14:22.942 --> 14:23.479
Aw...

14:23.512 --> 14:24.856
That's like a gift from the gods.

14:24.888 --> 14:27.479
Make sure she's not doing
anything, you know...

14:27.512 --> 14:29.013
Unsavory.

14:30.744 --> 14:33.943
Anyway heading to the I.C.U.

14:39.832 --> 14:42.359
Oh, Doc. Thank God. Her vision came back.

14:42.393 --> 14:43.775
I thought it would be good
if he hung out with Alex.

14:43.775 --> 14:45.860
- It keeps them both calmer.
- That was a great idea.

14:45.861 --> 14:47.552
I'm just gonna get in
there and take a look.

14:47.576 --> 14:49.112
You have any blurriness?

14:49.144 --> 14:50.615
Just a little.

14:50.648 --> 14:53.049
Thought my painting career
was over before it started.

14:53.073 --> 14:56.311
I can imagine. Well, your C.T.
came back and there's no acute bleeding,

14:56.345 --> 14:59.255
but we're still gonna have
ophthalmology and neurology take a look.

14:59.288 --> 15:00.471
How are you feeling?

15:01.319 --> 15:03.639
Aside from the bumps
and bruises, I feel okay.

15:03.673 --> 15:04.888
That's good.

15:04.920 --> 15:06.775
Have they figured out
why the building blew up?

15:06.809 --> 15:10.040
Alex, please. You need to rest.
Let the doctor go do her job.

15:10.041 --> 15:12.690
No it's okay. It's just early reports
are saying it's a gas-line leak.

15:12.714 --> 15:13.495
Oh, no.

15:13.529 --> 15:14.744
What's the matter?

15:14.776 --> 15:16.408
I was working late at the diner,

15:16.440 --> 15:18.903
and I can't remember if I
turned off the pilot light.

15:18.937 --> 15:21.752
Alex, it's not your fault,
honey. It couldn't be.

15:21.784 --> 15:24.919
Um... Somebody want to catch me up here?

15:24.952 --> 15:27.642
My diner is on the ground level of
the same building that was damaged.

15:27.653 --> 15:30.625
When we close up in the evenings, it's
Alex's job to turn off the pilot light

15:30.649 --> 15:33.202
- for the stove and water heater.
- And I couldn't remember if I did,

15:33.203 --> 15:35.491
so I got dressed and headed
back to the diner to check.

15:35.492 --> 15:36.760
But just as I went inside...

15:36.792 --> 15:40.311
Alex, I'm sure that your uncle is right.
I mean, have you ever forgotten before?

15:40.344 --> 15:42.680
No. No, it's just I...

15:42.712 --> 15:45.431
I just... I ca... I ca... can't remember.

15:45.907 --> 15:46.907
Alex?

15:47.864 --> 15:49.107
BP's 220 systolic.

15:49.108 --> 15:51.666
What does that mean?
What does that... Alex!

15:51.684 --> 15:53.446
- What does that mean? Alex?
- Weak on the right side.

15:53.447 --> 15:55.197
All right, start a nitro
drip. She's having a stroke.

15:55.209 --> 15:56.801
Boone, you're hyperventilating.

15:56.825 --> 15:58.316
- Try to breathe like me.
- Oh, God!

15:58.317 --> 15:59.234
Try to breathe like me.

15:59.235 --> 16:00.607
Oh, God! Oh, God!

16:00.937 --> 16:03.304
- Oh my God.
- There's no pulse.

16:03.574 --> 16:06.424
All right. His heart's
failing. Grab a crash cart.

16:06.456 --> 16:07.456
Come on. Come on.

16:08.216 --> 16:09.626
The last of the red and yellow tags

16:09.633 --> 16:10.813
have been moved to E.R.s.

16:10.868 --> 16:11.928
We got a few green tags,

16:11.929 --> 16:13.079
but I think everyone's been treated.

16:13.080 --> 16:14.224
Okay, great. Let's pack it up.

16:14.224 --> 16:15.249
Where's Gwen and Drew?

16:15.250 --> 16:16.850
They were doing last looks with Bennett.

16:23.933 --> 16:24.892
All right, everybody.

16:24.924 --> 16:26.634
We are looking for that big army medic.

16:26.635 --> 16:28.951
Drew, are you sure you and
Gwen saw him come in here?

16:28.952 --> 16:31.032
A guy that size
is kind of hard to miss.

16:31.064 --> 16:33.464
I saw him run into the building
after the second explosion.

16:35.320 --> 16:37.431
That's not good.

16:37.465 --> 16:39.511
I'm not leaving till I find him!

16:39.544 --> 16:40.471
Bennett!

16:40.504 --> 16:41.442
Bennett?!

16:41.443 --> 16:42.893
Bennett! Can you hear us?

16:42.894 --> 16:44.751
Over here! Over here!

16:45.689 --> 16:47.969
Bennett! We're here!

16:48.473 --> 16:50.167
Let's get this stuff off him.

16:50.200 --> 16:51.961
Can you guys move him?

16:52.921 --> 16:54.239
Watch that.

16:54.872 --> 16:56.856
Be really careful.

16:56.888 --> 16:59.384
Okay, I'll support his torso.

16:59.416 --> 17:00.567
Pull on three.

17:00.601 --> 17:01.308
Ready?

17:01.309 --> 17:02.902
Tee, his arm's been severed.

17:03.532 --> 17:04.502
Son of a bitch.

17:04.537 --> 17:06.434
We got to move him now.

17:07.252 --> 17:09.848
Okay. And now to reduce
the compartment pressure.

17:09.880 --> 17:12.087
10 blade to our intern.

17:12.121 --> 17:13.215
Seriously?

17:13.217 --> 17:14.840
Never do it, never learn.

17:15.031 --> 17:15.896
You're up, Paul.

17:15.896 --> 17:17.974
You mean an 11
blade, right, Dr. Clemmens?

17:17.999 --> 17:19.694
Well, I said 10. I meant 10.

17:19.694 --> 17:21.048
We all have our preferences.

17:21.048 --> 17:22.237
Well, it's not a preference.

17:22.238 --> 17:23.678
There's a right way and a wrong way.

17:23.833 --> 17:26.425
11 gives you a more precise
cut and less tissue trauma.

17:26.426 --> 17:27.768
I know what an 11 blade does,

17:27.800 --> 17:29.912
but we don't have time to be cute or fancy.

17:29.945 --> 17:32.599
This is a fasciotomy to reduce
the compartment pressure.

17:32.633 --> 17:33.815
This isn't neurosurgery.

17:33.849 --> 17:35.639
That's for sure.

17:36.952 --> 17:38.576
10 blade to our intern, please.

17:38.577 --> 17:40.129
Paul, use the 11 blade.

17:40.130 --> 17:43.557
Dr. Cummings, I understand that
you are used to running the show,

17:43.558 --> 17:46.343
but you are in my O.R., and I
cannot have you compromising my team.

17:46.344 --> 17:49.560
You will either have to let
us do our work or step out.

17:51.953 --> 17:53.807
Fine. I'll step out.

17:53.882 --> 17:56.601
Just drives me crazy to see
things done the wrong way.

17:59.448 --> 18:02.455
You've had to put up with
that your whole life, huh?

18:02.489 --> 18:05.432
I came out here to get
out from under his shadow.

18:05.464 --> 18:07.607
I guess Texas wasn't far enough.

18:07.641 --> 18:08.745
James Bennett, 23.

18:08.746 --> 18:11.288
Building collapse caused transhumeral
amputation to the left arm.

18:11.289 --> 18:12.563
Hypotensive and tachycardic.

18:12.564 --> 18:14.466
Mollie, prep this arm for re-attachment.

18:14.467 --> 18:17.111
My hand's burning. Just give me
something for it. I'll be okay.

18:17.145 --> 18:18.056
Take it easy, there, Bennett.

18:18.057 --> 18:20.128
Give me two migs of Ativan and
push another 10 of morphine.

18:20.152 --> 18:22.881
And, uh, Jocelyn, get me two units of
O-neg and set up for a central line.

18:22.905 --> 18:24.247
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy.

18:24.280 --> 18:25.559
Oh! Get... hey!

18:25.593 --> 18:26.775
I'm going back out there!

18:26.808 --> 18:28.318
He can shoot me if he wants me to stay!

18:28.319 --> 18:29.614
No one's gonna shoot you, okay?

18:29.620 --> 18:30.745
We're gonna take care of you.

18:30.746 --> 18:31.897
It's all going to be okay.

18:31.963 --> 18:32.615
All right.

18:32.920 --> 18:34.295
There we go.

18:34.755 --> 18:36.386
Jocelyn, can you call up
to surgery and make sure

18:36.387 --> 18:38.488
there's an O.R. free
for arm re-attachment?

18:38.489 --> 18:39.736
- Do it now.
- Right away.

18:39.737 --> 18:41.687
Okay. You okay? You took quite a shot.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.799
I'm good. I've been hit
harder than that before.

18:43.833 --> 18:45.815
On three. One, two, three.

18:47.961 --> 18:50.258
He's in heart failure.
There's fluid in his lungs.

18:50.259 --> 18:51.296
Did we miss a heart attack?

18:51.320 --> 18:52.823
No, his second troponin is normal.

18:52.824 --> 18:54.291
It's more complicated than that.

18:54.292 --> 18:55.923
- He needs an echocardiogram.
- Yeah.

18:55.924 --> 18:57.168
Alex's MRI is back.

18:57.858 --> 19:00.385
Whoa. Look at this.

19:00.953 --> 19:02.840
Things just got more complicated for Alex.

19:02.883 --> 19:04.585
Yeah. It's not good.

19:04.600 --> 19:05.975
Krista, stay here and watch Boone.

19:05.976 --> 19:07.639
I'll be upstairs getting
a surgical consult.

19:07.640 --> 19:08.919
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

19:12.920 --> 19:14.167
Alex has a carotid dissection

19:14.168 --> 19:15.880
that has sent blood clots to her brain.

19:16.137 --> 19:18.045
Well, that would explain the loss of vision

19:18.046 --> 19:19.511
- and then the stroke.
- Exactly.

19:19.512 --> 19:21.635
In a few hours, the damage from
the stroke will be permanent,

19:21.636 --> 19:23.433
and a large section of her brain will die.

19:24.285 --> 19:26.407
But there is a Hail Mary.

19:27.512 --> 19:30.293
- A-a mechanical embolectomy.
- Mm-hmm.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.481
We retrieve the clots from
her brain using a catheter.

19:32.633 --> 19:35.095
But we'll be hard-pressed
getting an interventionalist

19:35.096 --> 19:36.276
to the hospital at this hour.

19:36.277 --> 19:38.604
Yeah, well, the thing
is, we already have one.

19:40.433 --> 19:42.243
- Paul's dad.
- Mm-hmm.

19:42.296 --> 19:43.840
I've already called the
hospital for privileges,

19:43.864 --> 19:47.159
and they're sending over
authorization for the procedure now.

19:48.249 --> 19:50.231
I-I'd like you to ask him.

19:50.265 --> 19:54.106
I figure he'd respect you more,
you know? Surgeon to surgeon.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.216
Yeah.

20:00.248 --> 20:02.296
- Awesome. Thank you. I appreciate it.
- Mm-hm.

20:03.224 --> 20:05.001
Limb re-attachment in
the E.R.? I don't know.

20:05.002 --> 20:06.398
What's the wait on surgery and vascular?

20:06.399 --> 20:07.023
Backed up for hours.

20:07.024 --> 20:09.431
Bennett doesn't have
hours, okay? He'll lose the arm.

20:09.465 --> 20:12.485
I don't know his full story, but he's not
had it easy since post-deployment. So...

20:12.509 --> 20:15.163
So you got to let us try. Okay,
he's a soldier. He's one of us.

20:15.164 --> 20:16.746
He was out there saving
people and got hurt.

20:16.747 --> 20:18.113
I-I get what's at stake.
I want you guys to do it.

20:18.114 --> 20:19.073
But if we get swamped again,

20:19.074 --> 20:20.289
I can't have you two siphoned off

20:20.290 --> 20:21.984
for the rest of the night
while other people die.

20:22.008 --> 20:23.200
- Mollie.
- Yes?

20:23.201 --> 20:24.770
How we looking on mass casualty admits?

20:24.771 --> 20:26.784
I haven't had one in a while.
They say the area's all clear.

20:26.808 --> 20:28.599
- There you go.
- Okay, okay. Do it.

20:28.632 --> 20:30.176
But we get busy, I'm gonna pull you off.

20:30.200 --> 20:31.919
- We can't trade a life for an arm.
- Okay, thanks.

20:31.919 --> 20:33.777
- It wasn't a heart attack.
- No.

20:33.801 --> 20:35.455
How did his heart get so dilated?

20:35.462 --> 20:37.189
He mentioned that he was
under a lot of pressure

20:37.190 --> 20:38.117
earlier this evening.

20:38.172 --> 20:40.439
It could be the severe stressor

20:40.440 --> 20:42.550
that weakened his heart, causing dilation.

20:42.808 --> 20:44.727
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

20:44.760 --> 20:45.944
Broken-heart syndrome?

20:45.976 --> 20:47.319
That's what it looks like.

20:47.352 --> 20:50.487
He's gonna need a heart transplant...
or, at the very least, an LVAD.

20:50.520 --> 20:52.920
We'll let him know what his
options are when he wakes up.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.391
But for now, we should keep
an eye on Alex's surgery.

20:55.392 --> 20:57.226
- He'll want to know how she's doing.
- Okay.

20:57.227 --> 20:58.365
Okay. Thanks.

20:59.672 --> 21:01.175
All right, bud.

21:02.904 --> 21:06.455
And we've just received hospital
privileges for you to perform the surgery.

21:06.488 --> 21:07.672
Of course you did.

21:07.704 --> 21:11.624
So, um, Dr. Clemmens, you'll
allow me to use your O.R.?

21:11.775 --> 21:13.581
And perhaps an 11 blade?

21:15.014 --> 21:19.063
Look, I'm sorry if you felt that I was...

21:19.064 --> 21:21.024
Tactless. Disrespectful. Rude...

21:21.025 --> 21:22.135
Dad!

21:22.168 --> 21:23.927
Dad.

21:25.528 --> 21:29.143
You're the only one capable of the
procedure that will save her life.

21:31.128 --> 21:33.848
Okay? So, please, just... just do it.

21:40.504 --> 21:43.255
Fine. I'll perform the procedure.

21:43.288 --> 21:44.695
Under two conditions.

21:44.728 --> 21:48.119
One, Dr. Clemmens, you
stay out of my O.R.

21:48.153 --> 21:51.415
And two, I need Paul to assist me.

21:51.448 --> 21:54.231
It's his first night on surgery.

21:54.265 --> 21:55.767
It's not mine.

21:57.112 --> 21:59.160
Paul, scrub in.

21:59.192 --> 22:01.688
We can finally have that
talk you've been avoiding.

22:12.704 --> 22:14.968
And we are steering the catheter

22:14.969 --> 22:17.475
up to the blood clot in her brain.

22:18.775 --> 22:23.158
Opening the basket and grabbing the clot.

22:24.484 --> 22:25.823
Watch this, Paul.

22:26.240 --> 22:28.733
And just like that...

22:29.878 --> 22:31.806
Adios, clot.

22:32.704 --> 22:33.886
That's really cool.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.423
Oh, finally.

22:35.455 --> 22:37.406
You think your old man's cool.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.134
I've always thought that, Dad.

22:39.168 --> 22:42.047
Well, I find that hard to believe.

22:42.079 --> 22:44.767
You could've gone to my
Alma Mater or my med school

22:44.799 --> 22:46.991
or joined our practice
after your residency.

22:47.009 --> 22:49.150
I said I admired you. I didn't
say I want to be you.

22:49.151 --> 22:50.423
Can we do this later, please?

22:50.424 --> 22:51.910
Well, it's the only time I get to see you.

22:51.928 --> 22:54.900
Every time I call, you're
either too busy or too tired

22:54.901 --> 22:57.525
or whatever else you make
up to get me off the phone.

22:58.560 --> 23:02.914
So, let's talk about what
it's gonna take for you

23:02.915 --> 23:06.690
to accept a surgical
residency to Johns Hopkins.

23:07.904 --> 23:11.614
It's time for you to go big or go home.

23:12.704 --> 23:14.975
So, what was your lucky break?

23:15.007 --> 23:16.447
That's a long story.

23:17.147 --> 23:19.806
We're re-attaching an arm. We got time.

23:19.840 --> 23:21.055
Touché.

23:21.087 --> 23:23.167
You ever drive a '64 GTO?

23:23.199 --> 23:25.087
No. That the car you had growing up?

23:25.119 --> 23:26.366
Oh, hell no. I was broke.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.403
But Thad and I, we drove one one time.

23:28.404 --> 23:31.735
Man, driving that car was
a real come-to-Jesus moment.

23:31.736 --> 23:32.767
W-wait. So...

23:32.799 --> 23:35.039
Wait, did you and your bro steal a car?

23:35.071 --> 23:37.438
Oh, well, we were gonna return it.

23:37.472 --> 23:39.326
We used to go down to Camden Yards

23:39.359 --> 23:41.663
and "borrow" cars during games.

23:41.695 --> 23:44.478
We got about five blocks
before we got busted.

23:44.511 --> 23:46.696
Morning of the hearing, we're
on our way to the courthouse,

23:46.720 --> 23:48.606
and the energy felt wrong.

23:48.640 --> 23:50.014
So we look around,

23:50.048 --> 23:52.735
and everyone's eyes are on the TVs.

23:52.767 --> 23:54.751
And what was going on? What was on it?

23:54.783 --> 23:56.958
Well, we got there just in time

23:56.991 --> 23:58.526
to see the second plane

23:58.559 --> 24:01.598
crash into the World Trade Center.

24:01.632 --> 24:04.638
So we just sat there
and we watched, stunned.

24:04.671 --> 24:07.679
And, you know, just, uh...

24:07.711 --> 24:11.454
Made all the crap we were
doing just seem so childish.

24:11.487 --> 24:13.406
So we went up to the judge and we said,

24:13.440 --> 24:14.846
"Hey, if you let us off,"

24:14.879 --> 24:16.894
we will go straight down
to the recruiting office,

24:16.928 --> 24:18.239
sign up for the army,

24:18.271 --> 24:20.558
"go kick some serious ass for the U.S.A."

24:24.256 --> 24:25.950
- Some break.
- Yeah.

24:25.984 --> 24:28.159
I told you... boosting that car

24:28.191 --> 24:30.719
was a serious come-to-Jesus moment.

24:30.751 --> 24:32.734
So the army put me through med school.

24:32.767 --> 24:34.623
Without that, who knows where I'd be?

24:34.655 --> 24:35.710
Probably in prison,

24:35.743 --> 24:37.406
getting traded for a pack of cigarettes.

24:37.439 --> 24:38.846
I'm worth at least a carton.

24:38.879 --> 24:40.766
Whatever you say, Doc.

24:41.952 --> 24:43.967
I can't... I can't give you a decision.

24:43.999 --> 24:45.406
Well, you're gonna have to.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.966
They're not gonna hold that
residency for you forever.

24:47.999 --> 24:50.879
I didn't ask you to get me
one. And if I wanted one, Dad,

24:50.911 --> 24:52.766
I would've gotten one myself, all right?

24:52.799 --> 24:54.590
Maybe. It's very competitive.

24:54.624 --> 24:59.006
People would kill for this
opportunity. But you didn't even try.

24:59.039 --> 25:01.247
That tells me you were afraid.

25:01.279 --> 25:03.582
I wa... no, I wasn't afraid, okay?

25:03.616 --> 25:04.927
I didn't want to go there.

25:04.959 --> 25:06.559
Well, sometimes a father can see

25:06.591 --> 25:09.854
what's best for their child
even if they can't.

25:11.013 --> 25:12.355
Hey.

25:12.768 --> 25:15.166
Just checking in to see
how Alex's procedure went.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.734
How do you think it went?

25:16.767 --> 25:19.518
Paul, we'll talk about this later.

25:19.551 --> 25:21.411
I need to make sure your, uh, staff

25:21.412 --> 25:23.067
can properly take care of my patient.

25:26.772 --> 25:28.223
Come on. Let's take a walk.

25:30.591 --> 25:32.671
Please tell me we're done, Gwen.

25:32.703 --> 25:33.703
We've been given the all-clear.

25:33.727 --> 25:35.014
No more casualties headed this way.

25:35.038 --> 25:36.445
Finally!

25:36.449 --> 25:37.902
Yeah, it's been a hell of a night.

25:38.455 --> 25:39.070
Oh, hey.

25:39.103 --> 25:41.255
You were right with your advice
about my daughter's phone.

25:41.279 --> 25:42.292
Check this out.

25:42.293 --> 25:43.922
I mean, don't check it out.

25:44.287 --> 25:45.855
Whoa.

25:45.887 --> 25:48.049
That is a very skimpy bathing suit.

25:48.050 --> 25:50.014
I didn't even know she had that.

25:50.047 --> 25:52.462
I did not get her that phone to be sexting.

25:52.832 --> 25:54.238
I thought she was a nerd.

25:54.271 --> 25:56.319
I mean, I-I want her to be a nerd.

25:56.351 --> 25:58.279
Kids
are what they are, you know?

25:58.303 --> 25:59.455
Holy sh...

25:59.487 --> 26:01.983
she just said, "my dad works all night."

26:02.015 --> 26:04.030
He won't know if we hook up."

26:06.399 --> 26:09.598
She... she is... she is grounded forever.

26:09.631 --> 26:13.855
That text is going to be
her last on that phone.

26:13.887 --> 26:14.887
Wait.

26:14.912 --> 26:17.534
Hold on. Keep your cool.

26:17.567 --> 26:18.878
Don't blow your cover.

26:18.912 --> 26:20.831
Blow my cover? This isn't "The Departed".

26:20.863 --> 26:22.718
This is my daughter we're talking about.

26:22.752 --> 26:23.828
No, no. Look.

26:23.829 --> 26:27.006
When the Brits cracked the
Nazi code in World War II,

26:27.374 --> 26:29.829
they waited to get more information, right?

26:29.830 --> 26:31.135
I don't care about that.

26:31.167 --> 26:35.454
Some punk named sexyman916
is sexting with my daughter.

26:35.487 --> 26:37.534
Okay. Blow your cover.

26:37.567 --> 26:40.103
And you'll never know what
she's up to again, okay?

26:40.104 --> 26:41.254
Now, you listen to me.

26:41.314 --> 26:44.158
You have Janet make sure
she's in, and you track this.

26:44.191 --> 26:46.143
You don't know what else she's up to.

26:48.287 --> 26:49.579
I think I'm gonna be sick.

26:49.580 --> 26:51.468
Yeah, well, get used to it.

26:52.319 --> 26:55.166
I wish I had something like
that to know what Naomi's doing.

26:55.199 --> 26:57.438
Trust me... they grow up really fast.

27:01.471 --> 27:02.878
I hate technology.

27:05.503 --> 27:06.590
Hey.

27:06.623 --> 27:08.487
Hey, babe. Haven't seen you all night.

27:08.488 --> 27:11.256
So, limb attachment in the E.R.

27:11.263 --> 27:12.982
That's pretty exciting stuff.

27:12.983 --> 27:15.853
Yeah. Just waiting for it
to pink up, see if it worked.

27:15.904 --> 27:17.471
So, how you feeling, Mama?

27:17.503 --> 27:18.855
You didn't get any sleep this afternoon.

27:18.879 --> 27:21.455
I know... that's because
every time I close my eyes,

27:21.456 --> 27:23.560
there's a million questions
just running through my brain.

27:23.584 --> 27:24.958
You need to relax.

27:24.991 --> 27:26.129
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

27:26.130 --> 27:27.747
Yeah, I'm trying, but...

27:28.831 --> 27:30.303
Okay.

27:30.335 --> 27:31.934
Which O.B. are we going with?

27:31.967 --> 27:33.735
Where are we gonna live
once the baby gets here?

27:33.759 --> 27:36.675
And who's gonna take care of the
baby when we're both working a shift?

27:37.567 --> 27:38.814
Dr. Newton, my apartment,

27:38.847 --> 27:40.702
Topher will schedule
us on different shifts.

27:40.735 --> 27:42.378
I'm a genius. Problem solved.

27:42.379 --> 27:43.262
Thank you.

27:43.295 --> 27:45.917
Okay, well, I prefer Dr.
Zeuli over Dr. Newton,

27:45.918 --> 27:48.110
uh, your apartment is way too small,

27:48.111 --> 27:50.424
and we will never see each
other if we work separate shifts.

27:50.425 --> 27:51.742
When you put it like that...

27:51.776 --> 27:53.182
- Mm.
- Ahh.

27:53.215 --> 27:55.519
Jordan, I need you to talk
to Boone. He's freaking out.

27:55.551 --> 27:57.102
Okay. I'll be right there.

27:57.471 --> 27:59.166
Thank God you're cute.

27:59.199 --> 28:02.138
I have seen hundreds of surgical residents

28:02.139 --> 28:04.068
and E.R. interns do their rotations,

28:04.069 --> 28:07.350
and I can tell you, after one
day, you're in the top five.

28:08.274 --> 28:09.854
- Really?
- Yes.

28:09.887 --> 28:13.534
So I get why your father
pushes you as hard as he does.

28:13.567 --> 28:16.444
I'm sure you are a really good E.R. doc,

28:16.445 --> 28:18.544
but you could be an amazing surgeon.

28:19.455 --> 28:23.390
It's like when Jordan left
the Bulls to go play baseball.

28:23.423 --> 28:25.983
It just... it just felt like such a waste.

28:26.015 --> 28:28.159
Yeah, but that was his first love.

28:28.191 --> 28:30.046
He was just following his heart.

28:30.080 --> 28:30.878
Okay.

28:30.911 --> 28:32.190
So, what's in your heart?

28:32.223 --> 28:33.758
E.R. medicine?

28:36.415 --> 28:38.111
- No.
- Then what is?

28:38.143 --> 28:41.278
Because if you are just
rebelling against your father,

28:41.311 --> 28:44.574
then you're cutting your
nose off to spite your face.

28:44.607 --> 28:47.838
If you want to be a surgeon, be one.

28:53.791 --> 28:56.921
Boone, you do understand that if you refuse

28:56.922 --> 28:59.134
the medical advice that I'm giving you,

28:59.167 --> 29:01.726
your chance of survival is close to zero?

29:03.103 --> 29:05.214
Yes, I understand.

29:05.247 --> 29:06.814
Yes, I want to die.

29:10.847 --> 29:12.446
Where is this coming from?

29:14.207 --> 29:15.966
What about Alex?

29:15.999 --> 29:18.366
She's gonna need you now more than ever.

29:23.359 --> 29:25.790
Okay, look, I... I realize

29:25.823 --> 29:28.357
that a heart transplant
is a scary proposal...

29:28.358 --> 29:29.726
It's not that.

29:31.263 --> 29:33.822
The heart should go to someone else.

29:33.855 --> 29:34.974
Why would you s...

29:35.007 --> 29:36.158
Because.

29:38.399 --> 29:40.041
I caused that explosion

29:40.042 --> 29:41.694
that made that building collapse.

29:47.136 --> 29:48.095
Can't believe it.

29:48.127 --> 29:49.310
Hey. What's wrong?

29:49.343 --> 29:52.033
Our... our first patient
of the shift, Boone,

29:52.034 --> 29:54.135
the whole mass casualty was his fault.

29:54.136 --> 29:56.702
He just confessed to
me that he was bankrupt,

29:56.736 --> 29:58.846
so he intentionally set fire to his diner

29:58.879 --> 30:00.666
to collect the insurance money.

30:00.667 --> 30:02.056
He thought it was contained.

30:02.057 --> 30:04.567
And now he may have injured
or killed all of those people,

30:04.568 --> 30:06.235
not to mention his goddaughter.

30:07.584 --> 30:09.119
Has he been read his rights?

30:09.136 --> 30:10.239
The police are on their way,

30:10.240 --> 30:12.095
but for now, he's our patient,

30:12.128 --> 30:14.290
and... We just have to keep him alive.

30:14.296 --> 30:16.182
Except he's refusing medical treatment.

30:16.183 --> 30:17.177
He just wants to die.

30:17.178 --> 30:19.231
Yeah, I don't think he's
gonna get off that lucky.

30:19.263 --> 30:20.991
He's devastated about what he did.

30:21.024 --> 30:23.949
Especially how it's gonna affect
Alex. He can't even face her.

30:24.927 --> 30:26.783
Oh, man.

30:26.816 --> 30:28.895
I have to tell her before
the police get here.

30:28.928 --> 30:30.303
Good luck.

30:30.336 --> 30:31.998
- Mm.
- Yeah.

30:32.032 --> 30:33.918
Good times.

30:34.126 --> 30:35.906
So, they're taking this thing off?

30:35.911 --> 30:37.614
I was just starting to like it.

30:37.615 --> 30:39.519
It's kind of a cool look.

30:39.899 --> 30:41.306
Well, listen, with some time and healing

30:41.307 --> 30:42.649
and a good amount of physical therapy,

30:42.650 --> 30:44.105
you're gonna be ready to work.

30:44.106 --> 30:45.503
Work?

30:45.536 --> 30:47.455
Yeah, that's... that's very funny, Doc.

30:47.488 --> 30:49.620
Well, actually, we did
some digging in the V.A.

30:49.621 --> 30:52.607
They got a new program that
credits army medic service

30:52.640 --> 30:55.657
and gets guys like you jobs
in V.A. Emergency Centers.

30:55.658 --> 30:59.606
It's called an Intermediate Care
Technician. You train as you get paid.

30:59.613 --> 31:01.261
In 13 months, you're
gonna be fully certified

31:01.262 --> 31:03.162
to work in any hospital in the country.

31:03.584 --> 31:05.791
I had no idea. I thought the V.A. sucked.

31:05.824 --> 31:08.293
Well, nah. They do some
good things there, too.

31:08.329 --> 31:10.142
Don't paint them all bad.

31:10.176 --> 31:12.575
So, there's a slot waiting for you.

31:12.608 --> 31:16.112
You start class in a couple of weeks,
and then you earn while you learn.

31:17.568 --> 31:19.234
I'm sorry.

31:19.235 --> 31:21.119
I don't mean to be a big baby about this.

31:21.152 --> 31:22.219
Um...

31:22.720 --> 31:24.708
Just, nobody's ever, uh...

31:25.920 --> 31:27.954
Why are you guys doing this for me?

31:28.224 --> 31:29.439
I'm nobody.

31:29.472 --> 31:30.910
You're not a nobody.

31:30.944 --> 31:33.567
Everybody needs a break. This one's yours.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.135
Yeah.

31:35.168 --> 31:36.318
So don't screw it up.

31:36.352 --> 31:38.249
- Of course not.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:38.250 --> 31:40.017
- Sorry.
- Be careful.

31:40.608 --> 31:42.782
Let's let the surgery team finish this up.

31:47.648 --> 31:51.263
It's him. My guardian angel.

31:51.296 --> 31:53.132
That's one nice-sized angel.

31:53.133 --> 31:54.943
Glad you got your wing fixed.

32:04.689 --> 32:06.512
He was my only family.

32:07.481 --> 32:09.535
I can't believe he did this.

32:11.328 --> 32:12.877
Was it to help pay for my school?

32:12.878 --> 32:13.887
No.

32:13.920 --> 32:15.711
It had nothing to do with you.

32:15.744 --> 32:18.335
He got into money trouble
for a lot of reasons,

32:18.368 --> 32:21.659
and a good man made a bad decision.

32:22.295 --> 32:25.068
I think... I think it's best you try

32:25.069 --> 32:27.902
and remember all the good he did for you.

32:30.144 --> 32:32.350
I don't know if I'll be able to.

32:34.175 --> 32:35.486
Could you if you were me?

32:37.311 --> 32:38.431
I don't know.

32:38.938 --> 32:42.335
My father did some pretty stupid things,

32:42.368 --> 32:46.654
but lately, I find myself
remembering all the fun we had.

32:46.688 --> 32:51.039
You know, hiking in the woods
and, uh, homemade ice cream.

32:52.016 --> 32:55.055
I think it's important
to remember those things.

32:56.703 --> 32:59.039
I already miss him so much.

32:59.072 --> 33:00.799
I know you do, sweetie.

33:01.696 --> 33:02.751
I know.

33:05.888 --> 33:07.518
You were right.

33:07.552 --> 33:09.919
Surgery is in my blood.

33:09.951 --> 33:11.391
I'm good at it.

33:11.424 --> 33:13.247
You're very good at it.

33:13.279 --> 33:16.799
And... I think I might want to pursue it.

33:18.687 --> 33:20.862
Finally.

33:20.896 --> 33:23.155
You have no idea how happy that makes me.

33:23.156 --> 33:25.823
I'll call Dr. Nelson at
Hopkins and secure your spot.

33:25.824 --> 33:27.226
I didn't say "Hopkins."

33:28.095 --> 33:30.910
I don't understand. You said
you want to go into surgery.

33:30.944 --> 33:34.623
And I do... but on my own terms.

33:34.655 --> 33:37.974
And not just surgery ...pediatric surgery.

33:37.975 --> 33:39.898
- Pediatrics?
- Yeah.

33:39.905 --> 33:42.659
The drunks, the GSWs ...I can do that.

33:43.680 --> 33:45.662
But I like working with kids.

33:45.696 --> 33:48.127
And, you know, I'm good at it.

33:48.160 --> 33:51.119
Okay, that's a very tough discipline.

33:51.120 --> 33:53.589
And Johns Hopkins only has one slot.

33:53.590 --> 33:56.734
- I don't know if I can swing...
- You don't... you don't have to.

33:56.768 --> 33:58.527
I've already secured a slot.

33:58.559 --> 34:03.167
We're going to start a pediatric
surgical fellowship here next year.

34:04.352 --> 34:07.642
Paul will finish up his
internship and then move into

34:07.647 --> 34:10.014
a dual pediatric and
surgical E.R. residency.

34:10.047 --> 34:12.188
W... that's an awfully big bite.

34:12.188 --> 34:13.864
You risk being mediocre at both.

34:13.866 --> 34:15.467
Or being the best.

34:15.917 --> 34:17.406
Go big or go home, right?

34:22.958 --> 34:24.719
It's a pleasure to meet you, Dr. Cummings.

34:24.721 --> 34:25.721
Yeah.

34:27.007 --> 34:30.485
Look, I only want the best for you.

34:30.491 --> 34:32.158
I know you do, Dad.

34:32.451 --> 34:34.878
Believe me, I-I know.

34:35.908 --> 34:37.496
Ah, you know...

34:38.752 --> 34:43.326
A patient of mine...
Oren, uh, same age as me...

34:43.360 --> 34:46.462
he just, uh, passed away last night.

34:47.518 --> 34:50.494
And the last thing that he
wanted to do before he died

34:51.145 --> 34:53.703
was take a fishing trip with his father.

34:55.232 --> 34:57.054
He, uh, he never got to make it.

34:58.496 --> 35:01.310
That, uh, must have been
very tough on his father.

35:01.344 --> 35:03.934
There's nothing worse
than the loss of a child.

35:03.968 --> 35:05.255
Right.

35:06.144 --> 35:08.469
Well, I'm taking that fishing trip

35:08.470 --> 35:10.110
with his father this summer.

35:12.192 --> 35:13.768
And, um...

35:15.199 --> 35:18.334
And I know... I know it's not your thing...

35:18.368 --> 35:20.606
uh, it's probably not my thing, either...

35:20.640 --> 35:22.299
um...

35:22.300 --> 35:26.014
But I would... I would very
much like it if you came with us?

35:27.585 --> 35:30.103
Ah, sure. Sure.

35:30.417 --> 35:32.286
I'll see if I can make it.

35:32.320 --> 35:35.102
Busy schedule and all, you know.

35:36.639 --> 35:37.727
Yeah, of course.

35:38.197 --> 35:39.379
Paul.

35:39.871 --> 35:43.480
I'd love to come, but my surgeries
are booked so far in advance,

35:43.481 --> 35:45.087
there's nothing I can do.

35:45.088 --> 35:49.183
But maybe one day we can make that trip.

35:51.776 --> 35:53.324
Absolutely.

36:02.112 --> 36:03.167
Be good.

36:09.375 --> 36:10.970
Don't forget to call your mother.

36:11.807 --> 36:13.343
I won't forget.

36:17.543 --> 36:18.918
Great work, everyone.

36:18.950 --> 36:21.669
I just want to thank you
all for stepping up tonight.

36:21.702 --> 36:22.758
Even Ragosa.

36:22.790 --> 36:24.101
Solid work, Michael.

36:24.134 --> 36:26.117
Thank you.

36:26.150 --> 36:29.701
So, what's the latest in
teenage-daughter world?

36:29.733 --> 36:30.957
Anything juicy?

36:30.959 --> 36:32.165
Uh... Yeah.

36:32.199 --> 36:35.813
I got to say, your advice
was spot-on. Look at this.

36:35.846 --> 36:38.310
She organized a party for tonight

36:38.342 --> 36:40.754
while I'm working and Janet's
at her mom's with the twins.

36:40.755 --> 36:42.693
I think it's time to
bring that hammer down.

36:42.726 --> 36:44.453
- It's time, right?
- Absolutely.

36:44.486 --> 36:46.092
- This is gonna be fun, actually.
- Mm.

36:46.093 --> 36:48.549
Sometimes you got to
fire a shot across the bow

36:48.582 --> 36:50.251
showing Dad is not a pushover.

36:50.252 --> 36:51.910
Mm. And like you're always watching.

36:51.942 --> 36:53.381
Got to scare them sometimes.

36:54.141 --> 36:56.421
Yeah, Lynn. It's Dad. Do not even speak.

36:56.455 --> 36:58.022
You're grounded till you're 30.

36:59.046 --> 37:00.483
Yes, I can.

37:01.192 --> 37:03.926
Why? Because I know about the party.

37:04.743 --> 37:06.629
Put your mother on.

37:06.663 --> 37:08.317
She was not happy.

37:08.318 --> 37:09.566
Mm.

37:09.853 --> 37:11.302
Janet. Yeah.

37:11.334 --> 37:12.837
Did you know that our da...

37:14.510 --> 37:15.510
What?

37:15.686 --> 37:17.605
What?!

37:18.671 --> 37:21.838
I-I-I was just t-trying to...

37:23.216 --> 37:24.367
Okay. Okay.

37:24.371 --> 37:25.918
Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

37:26.884 --> 37:29.251
What was that?

37:29.542 --> 37:31.493
Well, Michael, apparently, um,

37:31.526 --> 37:34.533
my daughter knew that I
was spying the whole time.

37:34.566 --> 37:35.830
What? How?

37:35.831 --> 37:37.349
She's a nerd, like I said.

37:37.383 --> 37:39.850
She could tell when I opened her texts.

37:39.851 --> 37:41.093
And she told Janet.

37:41.126 --> 37:42.764
They're teaching dad a lesson in trust.

37:42.765 --> 37:45.900
Sexyman916 is a fake account.

37:47.654 --> 37:50.187
Now my daughter and
my wife are unhappy with me.

37:51.527 --> 37:52.549
It was a good plan.

37:52.582 --> 37:53.765
It was a terrible plan.

37:53.798 --> 37:54.789
Well, in hindsight.

37:54.822 --> 37:56.336
In any sight!

37:57.126 --> 37:59.264
Thanks a lot, Michael. Super advice.

37:59.265 --> 38:01.829
Can't wait to go home
to my own mass casualty.

38:02.904 --> 38:05.208
S-so put those over there for me. Thanks.

38:05.462 --> 38:07.750
So, any plans for after the shift?

38:07.782 --> 38:09.093
You asking?

38:09.126 --> 38:10.885
I think I just did.

38:11.680 --> 38:14.661
Hey, you don't have to. Just because we...

38:14.694 --> 38:16.464
Yes. Yes, we did.

38:16.860 --> 38:19.333
And I don't know about you,
but I'd like to do it again.

38:19.366 --> 38:22.758
But first, I'd like to take you to dinner.

38:22.790 --> 38:25.471
Goin' to a movie, maybe a Spurs game.

38:25.472 --> 38:26.437
Like a real date.

38:26.470 --> 38:29.061
Date or dates. Doesn't have to be just one.

38:31.654 --> 38:33.349
Kenny Fournette...

38:33.382 --> 38:35.006
- Hm?
- You are an interesting mix

38:35.007 --> 38:36.773
of ego and sensitivity, you know that?

38:36.806 --> 38:38.533
Hey, you know, I do what I can.

38:39.299 --> 38:41.829
But for now, let's go grab some pancakes.

38:41.862 --> 38:43.557
Oh, double stacks. I'm starving.

38:43.590 --> 38:44.965
Oooh!

38:44.998 --> 38:47.893
Oh. Just give me one minute. I got
one piece of business to finish.

39:02.918 --> 39:04.566
So, I was thinking that...

39:04.567 --> 39:08.133
with the kid and all, we
should get a bigger place.

39:08.166 --> 39:09.701
That's a great idea.

39:09.734 --> 39:11.013
Why didn't I think of that?

39:11.046 --> 39:12.229
'Cause I'm smarter than you.

39:12.262 --> 39:13.573
Shh. Don't speak.

39:13.606 --> 39:15.513
That was a hell of a night.

39:16.934 --> 39:19.398
So, are we all still
going out for breakfast,

39:19.430 --> 39:20.371
or are we just gonna...

39:20.372 --> 39:21.971
Yeah, getting up.

39:21.972 --> 39:24.495
How 'bout we just sit here
for another five minutes?

39:24.496 --> 39:25.758
Or 10 minutes.

39:25.759 --> 39:28.126
Yeah. I mean, we just
need a bit of rest is all.

39:28.582 --> 39:30.885
Maybe we just
call it an even half-hour.

39:30.919 --> 39:36.933
That's good, half an hour

39:43.734 --> 39:45.557
Ah, retribution.

39:45.862 --> 39:48.357
It will be swift and brutal.

39:48.390 --> 39:51.734
I just slammed my shin, in reaction.

39:52.305 --> 39:58.315
