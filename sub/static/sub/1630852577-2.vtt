00:01.201 --> 00:02.035
- [RuPaul] Previously,
(Queens screaming)

00:02.035 --> 00:03.370
on RuPaul's Drag Race.
(upbeat music)

00:03.370 --> 00:06.240
We are introducing the season 14
queens

00:06.240 --> 00:07.941
over two episodes.
(suspenseful music)

00:07.941 --> 00:10.410
And before this premiere episode
is over,

00:10.410 --> 00:12.746
one of you will sashay away.

00:14.348 --> 00:17.751
Welcome to the CNTs.
(queens wailing)

00:17.751 --> 00:19.286
(judges laughing, clapping)

00:19.286 --> 00:20.120
- You can go a little faster,

00:20.120 --> 00:20.954
but I'm not going to,

00:20.954 --> 00:22.456
'cause I got a hot shit in the
chamber.

00:22.456 --> 00:23.290
(dramatic music)

00:23.290 --> 00:25.792
- I'm a little, um...confused.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.396
- [RuPaul] June Jambalaya.

00:29.396 --> 00:30.230
- Tonight on the runway,

00:30.230 --> 00:32.399
I can see the dark shorts on
under this.

00:32.399 --> 00:34.768
The finishing touches
are gonna matter, June.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.169
- [RuPaul] Orion Story.

00:36.169 --> 00:37.738
- You gotta have joke
after joke after joke.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.139
And they gotta land.

00:39.139 --> 00:40.140
- [RuPaul] Kornbread with a K.

00:40.140 --> 00:41.708
- I loved the song.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.410
You were funny as hell.

00:43.410 --> 00:44.745
- You are the winner of
this week's challenge.

00:44.745 --> 00:47.347
(all clapping)
(Kornbread screaming)

00:47.347 --> 00:50.817
June Jambalaya, shante you stay.

00:50.817 --> 00:55.155
Orion, sashay away.
(dramatic music)

00:56.256 --> 00:58.825
(upbeat music)

01:04.598 --> 01:07.200
- Woo, girl.
- Lord have mercy.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.835
- We come back into the Werk
Room,

01:08.835 --> 01:10.570
and the vibe's pretty heavy.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.406
Orion was a giant sweetheart.

01:12.406 --> 01:16.977
And like, you watched her
heart break on that stage.

01:16.977 --> 01:19.446
And that could have been any of
us.

01:19.446 --> 01:22.482
- The whole world's about
to know we did that.

01:22.482 --> 01:24.451
Love you.
- Aw, we love you, Orion.

01:24.451 --> 01:25.686
- How are you feeling, June?

01:25.686 --> 01:26.687
- You killed it.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.256
- The moment you hear
you're in the bottom,

01:29.256 --> 01:31.959
I'm like, this is not how the
story end.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.727
I am not the first girl that
goes home.

01:33.727 --> 01:34.861
I was like, uh-uh, baby.

01:34.861 --> 01:36.663
This Jambalaya still
got some brewing to do.

01:36.663 --> 01:38.465
- Yeah yeah yeah.
- She's still cookin' bitch!

01:38.465 --> 01:39.499
(all laughing)

01:39.499 --> 01:42.970
- Ooh, lord, the Zatarain's
and Uncle Ben's gods

01:42.970 --> 01:45.305
were on side, honey.
(laughing)

01:45.305 --> 01:47.007
She has survived.

01:47.007 --> 01:48.809
So I got something to prove.

01:48.809 --> 01:51.211
All my life I had to fight,

01:51.211 --> 01:53.914
and I'll be damned if I stop
now.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.415
- This is the first
time June ever cleaned.

01:55.415 --> 01:56.683
She's got a maid at her house.

01:56.683 --> 01:57.784
That's the gag, I know the
bitch.

01:57.784 --> 01:58.819
She got a maid.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.854
Put some back into it.
(all laughing)

02:00.854 --> 02:02.723
- Put that juice in it!

02:02.723 --> 02:05.993
- Shake them black shorts.
(all laughing)

02:05.993 --> 02:08.328
Hopefully you hoes understand
now.

02:08.328 --> 02:10.464
Baby, Kornbread came here to
compete.

02:10.464 --> 02:13.867
- Congratulations, bitch.
- Congratulations, honey.

02:13.867 --> 02:14.935
- It definitely felt great.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.370
So at this point it's just like,
bitch,

02:16.370 --> 02:17.904
now they really looking
at the whole, like,

02:17.904 --> 02:19.973
did we give that $5000 to the
right hoe?

02:19.973 --> 02:21.174
Bitch, you did, bitch!

02:21.174 --> 02:23.110
(all laughing)

02:23.110 --> 02:26.380
- So how are you feeling
about meeting the other group?

02:26.380 --> 02:27.881
- Girl.
(dramatic music)

02:27.881 --> 02:29.983
- I don't really need
to meet anybody else.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.518
There's like a lot of
strength in this cast.

02:31.518 --> 02:32.352
- Yeah.

02:32.352 --> 02:33.487
- I'm hoping they're all ugly.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.988
(all laughing)

02:34.988 --> 02:36.823
- I hope they don't
touch none of my stuff,

02:36.823 --> 02:38.658
'cause you know, it's gonna go
from RuPaul

02:38.658 --> 02:41.561
to Bad Girls Club real fast.
(all laughing)

02:41.561 --> 02:43.196
- They touch anything of yours,
June,

02:43.196 --> 02:44.865
we know it won't be tights.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.199
(all laughing)

02:46.199 --> 02:48.268
I gotta get up out of this.
(suspenseful music)

02:48.268 --> 02:49.336
- We survived week one,

02:49.336 --> 02:50.771
but that's not gonna last for
long,

02:50.771 --> 02:52.406
'cause we got some next bitches
coming up

02:52.406 --> 02:53.940
to come take our spot.

02:53.940 --> 02:56.376
And if they're just as strong as
we are,

02:56.376 --> 02:59.746
things are bound to blow the
fuck up.

02:59.746 --> 03:01.748

(upbeat dance music)

03:29.643 --> 03:30.477
- Hello-tis!

03:30.477 --> 03:33.313
It is gorgeous like Jorgeous.

03:33.313 --> 03:34.881
Ow!
(spicy Latin music)

03:34.881 --> 03:39.286
It is me, the one, the
only gorgeous Jorgeous.

03:39.286 --> 03:42.989
And I am the little spicy,
little Latina goddess.

03:42.989 --> 03:45.559
Make sure you get this mug,
mama.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.060
I would describe my drag style

03:47.060 --> 03:50.764
as a very Tex Mex Latina
Showgirl realness.

03:50.764 --> 03:53.033
My drag is inspired by Latina
women.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.634
J Lo, Selena.

03:54.634 --> 03:57.604
It's hella chooky, hella bad
bitch.

03:57.604 --> 04:01.842
I might be small, but
I do pack a big punch.

04:01.842 --> 04:05.345
Shit, there looks like there's
already been queens here.

04:05.345 --> 04:07.781
Okay we got another Latina in
here.

04:07.781 --> 04:10.450
I started doing drag
when I was 16 years old.

04:10.450 --> 04:12.819
I became known as a
danging queen in Texas.

04:12.819 --> 04:15.755
A young dancing queen in Texas.

04:15.755 --> 04:17.524
It's gonna be a lit ass season.

04:17.524 --> 04:19.359
Let's get litty titty.

04:19.359 --> 04:22.229
And now, I'm on RuPaul's Drag
Race.

04:22.229 --> 04:24.397
Let's get this party started.

04:24.397 --> 04:26.700
RuPaul's Drag Race Season 14!

04:26.700 --> 04:27.534
Oh my god!

04:28.969 --> 04:31.304
(sensual jazz music)

04:31.304 --> 04:33.240
- Alright Season 14,

04:33.240 --> 04:35.008
let's get thickening!

04:36.910 --> 04:37.777
What's up, bitches?

04:37.777 --> 04:38.912
My name is DeJa Skye,

04:38.912 --> 04:40.380
and I'm here to let you know,

04:40.380 --> 04:43.250
embrace the curve, people.

04:43.250 --> 04:44.818
- [Jorgeous] She's campy!

04:44.818 --> 04:45.719
(upbeat dance music)

04:45.719 --> 04:48.989
- My drag is bold, it's
colorful.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.257
I love pastel.

04:50.257 --> 04:51.725
They call me Pastel Princess.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.426
I'm a choreographer for cheer
and dance.

04:53.426 --> 04:54.461
I love to move my body.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.296
I'm big, but I can break it
down.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.166
Oh my god, bitch, we are here!

04:59.166 --> 05:00.433
- Good morning, sister!

05:00.433 --> 05:02.402
- Oh my god.
- So nice to meet you.

05:02.402 --> 05:03.570
- What is your name?
- Jorgeous.

05:03.570 --> 05:05.038
- DeJa Skye.
- DeJa Skye.

05:05.038 --> 05:05.872
- Oh!
- Yes!

05:05.872 --> 05:07.240
- Bitch, you look good, bitch.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.074
Where are you from?

05:08.074 --> 05:09.342
- Fresno.
- Fresno, California?

05:09.342 --> 05:10.544
- Unfortunately.

05:10.544 --> 05:11.811
It's the armpit.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.446
- Oh my god.

05:13.446 --> 05:14.447
Are you a Latina?

05:14.447 --> 05:15.815
- A lot of people think I'm
Latina,

05:15.815 --> 05:16.917
but I'm actually Black and
white.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.785
- Oh okay, yes ma'am.
- Yeah, but honestly,

05:18.785 --> 05:20.820
the Latin community has
taken me under their wing.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.422
- Yes ma'am.
- It's a Bingo wing.

05:22.422 --> 05:24.858
But it's a wing.
- Yes! (laughing)

05:24.858 --> 05:28.395
(exciting dance music)

05:28.395 --> 05:31.565
- Oh this here is just the entry
look.

05:32.632 --> 05:33.867
I'm Jasmine Kennedie,

05:33.867 --> 05:36.336
and I'm the ditzy doll of New
York City.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.604
Queens would definitely say my
drag

05:37.604 --> 05:41.074
is polished and pageantry as it
could be.

05:41.074 --> 05:43.143
- [Jorgeous] Bitch, she is
stoned!

05:43.143 --> 05:45.212
- My most impressive drag talent

05:45.212 --> 05:46.913
is my dancing capability.

05:46.913 --> 05:48.848
You ain't gotta worry about a
dance challenge for me, mama.

05:48.848 --> 05:52.185
Five, six, seven, eight,
choreo, here we go!

05:52.185 --> 05:53.420
(all wailing)

05:53.420 --> 05:55.622
- Sisters!
- Oh my god!

05:55.622 --> 05:57.424
- Nice to meet you.
(smooching)

05:57.424 --> 05:58.858
What's your name, baby?
- DeJa, what are you?

05:58.858 --> 05:59.993
- DeJa, Jasmine Kennedie.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.595
- Hi Jas!
- Jorgeous! I know you, bitch.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.196
- Bitch, I know you too.
- I know you, ah!

06:03.196 --> 06:04.564
I am already starstruck,

06:04.564 --> 06:05.865
'cause I've followed Jorgeous

06:05.865 --> 06:07.867
for a very long time.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.970
- Bitch, you better dance the
house down.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.605
- Are you a dancer?
- I am a dancer.

06:11.605 --> 06:13.473
- Are you a dancer?
- Oh yes ma'am.

06:13.473 --> 06:15.041
She's a dancing diva, too,

06:15.041 --> 06:18.812
so that could be my
biggest competition here.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.080
Not gonna lie.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.082
Season 14.
- Season 14, we're here.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.683
And it looks like, by the looks
of it,

06:23.683 --> 06:25.051
some of the girls have already
been here.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.453
- I know.
- Okay we got some cute hair

06:26.453 --> 06:27.520
over there.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.122
We got some chain saws.

06:29.122 --> 06:30.724
- Chain saws?
- We've got leather.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.692
- The way I'm planning on
sticking out of the pack,

06:32.692 --> 06:35.328
one, if it's not for my
dance skills and my costumes,

06:35.328 --> 06:37.030
it's definitely gonna
be with my personality.

06:37.030 --> 06:40.367
And I'm, ugh, so anxious! I
cannot wait.

06:42.302 --> 06:46.039
(backwoods country music)

06:46.039 --> 06:47.974
- You ready to pitch a tent,
America?

06:47.974 --> 06:49.809
The camp queen is here.

06:49.809 --> 06:51.911
- Oh she's on fire.

06:51.911 --> 06:52.746
(back swamp rock)

06:52.746 --> 06:53.580
- My name is Maddy Morphosis,

06:53.580 --> 06:54.948
and I am Arkansas' most
beautiful

06:54.948 --> 06:56.316
camp and comedy queen.

06:56.316 --> 06:57.317
People will say my drag is
stupid

06:57.317 --> 06:58.218
in a good way.

06:58.218 --> 06:59.753
Funny, clever, witty.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.054
- She's flame broiled.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.122
She's a burger queen.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.857
(all laughing)

07:03.857 --> 07:04.891
- I am on fire

07:04.891 --> 07:06.459
in this beautiful Guy Fieri

07:06.459 --> 07:08.061
inspired dress.
(car horn honking)

07:08.061 --> 07:11.331
To my knowledge, I'm the first
cisgendered heterosexual man

07:11.331 --> 07:12.599
to make it to Drag Race.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.200
(all yelling)

07:14.200 --> 07:15.368
Hi queens!

07:15.368 --> 07:16.436
- What is your name?

07:16.436 --> 07:17.637
- I'm Maddy Morphosis.

07:17.637 --> 07:20.273
- [All] Maddy Morphosis.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.141
- Where are you from, babes?

07:21.141 --> 07:22.375
- I'm from Fayetteville,
Arkansas.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.110
- I have some trade in Arkansas.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.545
- You nasty bitch.
- Oh! (laughing)

07:25.545 --> 07:28.348
- My condolences.
(all laughing)

07:28.348 --> 07:29.349
I'm sure a lot of these queens

07:29.349 --> 07:31.484
have probably even never
even met a drag queen

07:31.484 --> 07:32.319
that was straight.

07:32.319 --> 07:34.988
But, I don't feel the need to
clarify, like, my sexuality.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.657
I really want the first
impression
that the girls have of me

07:37.657 --> 07:39.693
to be the content of my drag.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.361
- How long does it take you to
get ready?

07:41.361 --> 07:42.762
- I just woke up like this.
- Oh yes ma'am.

07:42.762 --> 07:44.097
- Just a little chap stick,
mascara.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.465
- Yes, ma'am.
(laughing)

07:45.465 --> 07:49.235
My first impression of Maddy is
very...

07:49.235 --> 07:52.238
I wanna see what else you got.
(laughing)

07:52.238 --> 07:54.541
(old time jazz music)

07:54.541 --> 07:56.876
(queens wooing)

07:56.876 --> 07:58.144
- The name's Angeria,

07:58.144 --> 07:59.813
but you can call me Angie.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.015
Now let's make it shake, honey!

08:02.015 --> 08:03.616
(queens cheering)
(exciting music)

08:03.616 --> 08:05.719
My name is Angeria Paris
VanMichaels,

08:05.719 --> 08:08.822
and I'm the Southern Belle from
ATL.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.090
(bell dings)
(exciting music resumes)

08:10.090 --> 08:12.826
Angeria is probably the most
glamorous

08:12.826 --> 08:15.562
country bumpkin that you
will ever meet in your life.

08:15.562 --> 08:17.397
I am loud, I am country,

08:17.397 --> 08:19.265
but I'm also very polished.

08:19.265 --> 08:22.669
Yeah, I just look like
a star everywhere I go.

08:22.669 --> 08:23.803
Mm-hmm.

08:23.803 --> 08:26.639
Hey ladies!
(queens cheering)

08:26.639 --> 08:28.408
- You a padge girl?
- Yes, I am a pageant girl.

08:28.408 --> 08:29.242
- Let's go padge.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.310
We're here to gag.
- You can tell?

08:30.310 --> 08:32.612
- Yes I can tell.
- Oh how can you tell?

08:32.612 --> 08:34.114
(all laughing)

08:34.114 --> 08:35.882
Old school pageant drag.

08:35.882 --> 08:37.884
Old school music, that's what I
do.

08:37.884 --> 08:39.285
I'll ballad you to death.

08:39.285 --> 08:40.520
Oh yeah.
(all laughing)

08:40.520 --> 08:42.021
I know how to really pull you
in,

08:42.021 --> 08:44.491
and you know, captivate a
audience.

08:44.491 --> 08:47.894
- (laughing) I love that.

08:47.894 --> 08:50.196
- I'm actually getting some
really really good vibes,

08:50.196 --> 08:52.332
some good energy from the girls.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.334
But I know they are looking at
me like,

08:54.334 --> 08:57.203
this bitch did not come here to
play.

08:57.203 --> 09:00.540
And they are absolutely
right, 'cause I did not.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.675
(upbeat dance music)

09:02.675 --> 09:03.777
- Oh!

09:03.777 --> 09:06.279
- Hello, you sexy bitches!

09:06.279 --> 09:07.914
- Oh my god!

09:07.914 --> 09:09.182
- I am Lady Camden,

09:09.182 --> 09:11.818
and I am America's little Spice
Girl.

09:11.818 --> 09:13.086
Girl power.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.722
I'm originally from
Camdentown in North London.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.457
And now I live in Sacramento.

09:17.457 --> 09:19.826
- Is that bra edible?
(all laughing)

09:19.826 --> 09:20.660
- When I'm in drag,

09:20.660 --> 09:24.497
I sort of live in my 90s
pop princess fantasy.

09:24.497 --> 09:26.633
There's always something
that's a little tacky,

09:26.633 --> 09:29.102
but just tacky enough.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.404
(all cheering)
(upbeat music)

09:31.404 --> 09:34.073
- Oh my god!
- Oh my god!

09:34.073 --> 09:35.408
I know DeJa from back home.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.342
We've performed together.

09:36.342 --> 09:37.677
What the fuck are you doing
here?

09:37.677 --> 09:38.711
- I'm saying!

09:38.711 --> 09:40.780
- I am so surprised to see her
here.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.482
I mean, we just haven't had a
lot of

09:42.482 --> 09:44.884
North California representation.

09:44.884 --> 09:45.718
Work.

09:45.718 --> 09:46.753
- What's your type of drag?

09:46.753 --> 09:49.355
- I'm sort of like the sixth
member of the Spice Girls.

09:49.355 --> 09:50.323
(all exclaiming)

09:50.323 --> 09:51.357
- Old Spice.
(record scratches)

09:51.357 --> 09:53.927
- Old Spice?
(all laughing)

09:53.927 --> 09:55.762
- I'm Country Spice,
it's nice to meet you.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.030
(all laughing)

09:57.030 --> 09:58.364
- Country Spice, I love that.

09:58.364 --> 09:59.199
Where are you from?

09:59.199 --> 10:00.600
- Oh, I'm from Sparta, Georgia,

10:00.600 --> 10:01.734
but I live in Atlanta.

10:01.734 --> 10:02.735
- I love that accent,

10:02.735 --> 10:04.471
it's just really getting my
nipples hard.

10:04.471 --> 10:05.772
(all exclaiming)

10:05.772 --> 10:07.640
- We can like, find us a room,

10:07.640 --> 10:09.609
and just talk to each other all
day.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.878
(all laughing)

10:11.878 --> 10:14.714
(hard rock music)

10:17.684 --> 10:18.518
- Okay.

10:19.352 --> 10:23.490
- You Betty be ready! (laughing)

10:23.490 --> 10:24.724
Woo!

10:24.724 --> 10:28.361
I'm Daya Betty, and I am your
mid-Missouri

10:28.361 --> 10:30.497
grunge punk rock girl.

10:30.497 --> 10:32.098
- It's kinda giving me
Pikachu a little bit.

10:32.098 --> 10:33.867
- Oh my god.
(laughing)

10:33.867 --> 10:35.902
- My drag is really inspired

10:35.902 --> 10:39.072
by the 80s grunge movement,
early 90s.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.875
Daya's a rock star,

10:41.875 --> 10:44.177
and she's the rock star's
girlfriend,

10:44.177 --> 10:47.347
shoved together with a
safety pin shoved through it.

10:47.347 --> 10:50.250
(all cheering)

10:50.250 --> 10:52.285
- What is your name?
- I'm Daya Betty.

10:52.285 --> 10:54.554
- Daya Betty, you're beautiful!

10:54.554 --> 10:57.023
- Oh my gosh, Maddy?

10:57.023 --> 10:58.791
- Daya.
- Oh my gosh, how are you?

10:58.791 --> 10:59.626
- Good!

10:59.626 --> 11:02.762
- Maddy Morphosis, my Midwest
sister.

11:02.762 --> 11:05.298
I've kind of hung out with
her just a couple times.

11:05.298 --> 11:06.599
I've seen her at the club.

11:06.599 --> 11:09.869
There is a lot that she has to
show us.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.038
A lot.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.475
Are you Jorgeous?
- Yes ma'am!

11:15.475 --> 11:17.143
- Oh my god, my boyfriend
is obsessed with you.

11:17.143 --> 11:18.411
- Oh my god, I'm a mess.

11:18.411 --> 11:19.245
I promise.
- I'm pretty sure

11:19.245 --> 11:20.947
that you're his favorite drag
queen.

11:20.947 --> 11:23.316
- So nice to meet you, mama.
(all laughing)

11:23.316 --> 11:26.886
- Daya Betty is giving me
somebody else.

11:26.886 --> 11:29.622
But I cannot figure out for the
life of me

11:29.622 --> 11:31.224
who she is giving.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.392
- I have a feeling you're
related

11:32.392 --> 11:33.893
to someone who's been
on here before, right?

11:33.893 --> 11:35.028
- I am, yes.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.297
Crystal Methyd.
♪ Feel the beat of the rhythm ♪

11:37.297 --> 11:38.164
♪ Of the night ♪
- Ding, there it is.

11:38.164 --> 11:40.066
Crystal Methyd.

11:40.066 --> 11:42.468
- We don't say "Drag
Mom" because it ages her.

11:42.468 --> 11:44.804
But we're all kind of a
little edgy, a little punk.

11:44.804 --> 11:47.206
Everything we do crafty,
a little handmade.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.676
- [RuPaul] Ooh, girl!
(siren wailing)

11:49.676 --> 11:52.345
She done already done had
herses.

11:52.345 --> 11:53.913
(all wailing)
(exciting music)

11:53.913 --> 11:55.315
- Oh my god it's happening!

11:55.315 --> 11:56.449
- Hold on, I'm coming!

11:56.449 --> 11:57.750
- Oh my gosh!
- Oh my god!

11:57.750 --> 11:59.085
- Welcome, queens.
(upbeat dance music)

11:59.085 --> 12:00.320
(all cheering)

12:00.320 --> 12:02.956
The Werk Room has already been
entered.

12:02.956 --> 12:04.991
But it's not about when you
start,

12:04.991 --> 12:07.493
it's about how long you last.

12:07.493 --> 12:09.729
So put some motion in your
ocean,

12:09.729 --> 12:11.698
and let's get it on!

12:11.698 --> 12:15.134
(all cheering, clapping)

12:16.069 --> 12:19.038
Hello hello hello!
(all cheering)

12:19.038 --> 12:21.407
Hi!
(queens exclaiming)

12:21.407 --> 12:23.076
- RuPaul walks into the door,

12:23.076 --> 12:25.612
and I swear to god, she is just
glowing.

12:25.612 --> 12:27.280
My mom always said it's
not polite to stare,

12:27.280 --> 12:29.482
but I can't help it.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.217
- Welcome to the second premiere

12:31.217 --> 12:33.720
of RuPaul's Drag Race,
officially.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.088
(all cheering)

12:35.088 --> 12:36.422
- Yes, mother!

12:36.422 --> 12:38.191
- First, I want to thank your
mamas,

12:38.191 --> 12:40.793
your drag mamas, the bullies at
school,

12:40.793 --> 12:43.329
and everybody who helped make
you

12:43.329 --> 12:45.865
the strong queen you are today.

12:45.865 --> 12:46.999
(all cheering)

12:46.999 --> 12:50.003
'Cause you gonna need all
that strength and more

12:50.003 --> 12:52.105
as you compete in the biggest,

12:52.105 --> 12:56.042
baddest drag competition on the
planet.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.810
(all cheering)

12:57.810 --> 12:58.745
- Yes!

12:58.745 --> 13:01.681
- Now last week, we got to
know seven of your competitors.

13:01.681 --> 13:04.884
And I asked one of them to
sashay away.

13:04.884 --> 13:07.620
(dramatic music)

13:10.356 --> 13:12.692
- She tells us that a
queen has already gone.

13:12.692 --> 13:14.527
There's a bit of a twist.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.462
- And by the end of tomorrow,

13:16.462 --> 13:21.300
I'll be asking one of you
to sashay away as well.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.703
- The reality is someone's
already gone.

13:23.703 --> 13:24.871
This shit is serious.

13:24.871 --> 13:27.340
Like, we're getting right
into the competition.

13:27.340 --> 13:30.076
I'm just like, please let
me get out of this alive.

13:30.076 --> 13:31.244
(suspenseful music)

13:31.244 --> 13:33.880
- So I hope y'all hungry to win.

13:35.014 --> 13:38.384
'Cause your country
breakfast is ready, girl.

13:38.384 --> 13:40.653
(RuPaul laughing)

13:40.653 --> 13:41.487
Let's go.

13:42.455 --> 13:45.024
(upbeat music)

13:46.759 --> 13:49.095
Deja Skye, hello darling.

13:49.095 --> 13:49.929
- Hi!

13:49.929 --> 13:52.932
- Say hello to celebrity
photographer, Albert Sanchez.

13:52.932 --> 13:53.766
- Hi.

13:53.766 --> 13:56.202
- Now, the goal of this
competition

13:56.202 --> 13:58.171
is to make it all the way
through

13:58.171 --> 13:59.906
to the Tic Tac lunch.

13:59.906 --> 14:00.740
- Yes.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.675
- So for your very first mini
challenge,

14:02.675 --> 14:06.579
I want you to pose with
this bowl of Tic Tacs.

14:06.579 --> 14:07.880
Can you do that?

14:07.880 --> 14:09.148
- I absolutely can.

14:09.148 --> 14:11.651
- Good, make a purdy picture.
(upbeat electronic music)

14:11.651 --> 14:13.286
- Ooh, Tic Tac.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.087
Ooh, oh.

14:16.889 --> 14:18.558
- Wait a minute.
(shady music)

14:18.558 --> 14:20.293
I don't know what it is, but
DeJa,

14:20.293 --> 14:23.563
something's off with the
whole...

14:23.563 --> 14:26.099
(dramatic music)

14:26.099 --> 14:28.167
- I'm freaked out 'cause
I'm like, what did I do?

14:28.167 --> 14:29.001
Is it a bad angle?

14:29.001 --> 14:30.803
What's going on?

14:30.803 --> 14:34.607
- This is really not
what I asked for, Albert.

14:36.275 --> 14:39.712
I thought we talked about
an abundance of Tic Tacs.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.882
I mean, we had that
conversation.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.485
You call this an abundance of
Tic Tacs?

14:45.485 --> 14:48.588
I want an abundance of Tic Tacs!

14:48.588 --> 14:52.492
Why do I have to do
everything around here?

14:52.492 --> 14:56.596
Why I (mumbles incoherently)
(dramatic music)

14:56.596 --> 14:57.430
Why?!

14:58.431 --> 15:00.733
- Oh my god, it's everywhere.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.903
- I need you to move that bitch

15:03.903 --> 15:05.738
of a bearing wall,

15:05.738 --> 15:08.407
and put a giant bowl of Tic Tacs

15:09.509 --> 15:13.179
where a giant bowl of
Tic Tacs ought to be.

15:13.179 --> 15:17.583
Move it!
(suspenseful music)

15:17.583 --> 15:19.585
(laughing)
(upbeat music)

15:19.585 --> 15:21.988
- She moves the wall, oh,

15:21.988 --> 15:25.992
and all I see is this bowl of a
thousand,

15:25.992 --> 15:28.361
million bazillion Tic Tacs.

15:28.361 --> 15:31.097
And right next to it, The Pit
Crew.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.131
Oh!

15:32.131 --> 15:35.902
- Now that's an abundance of Tic
Tacs.

15:35.902 --> 15:36.736
DeJa.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.272
Let's go.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.407
(upbeat dance music)

15:41.407 --> 15:43.276
Alright now DeJa Skye,

15:43.276 --> 15:47.180
you need to serve face
and pose the house down.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.248
Ooh, yes!
- Oh.

15:50.349 --> 15:52.418
- I like the way you think.

15:52.418 --> 15:55.588
(upbeat music)

15:55.588 --> 15:58.558
Ooh, I'm getting quite the DeJa
view.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.193
- Let me go this way.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.828
- Oh, yeah.

16:01.828 --> 16:04.564
Luxuriate, yes.
(camera clicking)

16:04.564 --> 16:06.632
- I'm just rolling like
rotisserie chicken.

16:06.632 --> 16:07.967
(RuPaul laughs)

16:07.967 --> 16:11.037
There's no way to feel
sexy in this moment.

16:11.037 --> 16:12.672
- Just keep in mind the shadow.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.273
You want to work the light.

16:14.273 --> 16:15.374
- Got it.

16:15.374 --> 16:16.976
(RuPaul laughs)

16:16.976 --> 16:18.344
Was that good?

16:18.344 --> 16:20.680
- [RuPaul] What's your sleep
number, DeJa?

16:20.680 --> 16:21.948
Angeria.

16:21.948 --> 16:23.216
- Okay, am I getting in?

16:23.216 --> 16:24.050
- [RuPaul] Yes!

16:24.050 --> 16:26.986
- I'm getting in, but no heels.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.588
Oh, there I go.

16:28.588 --> 16:29.689
(upbeat music)
(RuPaul giggles)

16:29.689 --> 16:31.657
- [RuPaul] Oh, what are
people at church gonna say?

16:31.657 --> 16:33.659
Yes, Miss Black Atlanta!

16:34.694 --> 16:36.395
- Ooh, wait a minute.

16:36.395 --> 16:37.296
(RuPaul laughs)

16:37.296 --> 16:39.232
It's Tic Tacs in my hair,

16:39.232 --> 16:40.399
Tic Tacs in my titties,

16:40.399 --> 16:42.902
Tic Tacs in my mm-hmm-hmm.

16:42.902 --> 16:45.137
- Welcome to Angeria.

16:45.137 --> 16:47.673
The land of orange diamonds.

16:47.673 --> 16:50.710
This ain't Wakanda, this is
Angeria!

16:50.710 --> 16:53.913
Looking good and feeling
Jorgeous.

16:53.913 --> 16:55.114
- Yes, ma'am, mama!

16:55.114 --> 16:56.883
- Now since this is a Tic Tac
breakfast,

16:56.883 --> 16:58.451
I'm gonna ask you some
questions.

16:58.451 --> 17:02.221
You respond with your face
and body language only.

17:02.221 --> 17:03.055
- Okay.

17:03.055 --> 17:05.892
- What's your favorite
Britney Spears song?

17:05.892 --> 17:07.460
"Oops!...I Did It Again."

17:07.460 --> 17:09.528
How does the Pit Crew make you
feel

17:09.528 --> 17:11.097
in between me down there?

17:11.097 --> 17:12.298
- Oh.

17:12.298 --> 17:17.303
(RuPaul laughs)
(spicy music)

17:18.971 --> 17:20.640
- Gracias!

17:20.640 --> 17:22.475
Oh Jasmine Kennedie.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.143
Ooh, fling that hair, yes!

17:24.143 --> 17:25.044
Look at those cheek bones.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.513
You could cut somebody with
those things.

17:27.513 --> 17:29.649
Answer with your pose, okay?

17:29.649 --> 17:32.184
Who's your favorite movie star?

17:32.184 --> 17:34.186
Charlize Theron?

17:34.186 --> 17:35.254
Milton Berle?

17:36.522 --> 17:39.558
You must have gone to the
Barbazon School of Modeling.

17:39.558 --> 17:40.993
Maddy Morphosis.

17:40.993 --> 17:43.029
Yes!
(upbeat music)

17:43.029 --> 17:45.865
Tic Tacs are a girl's best
friend.

17:45.865 --> 17:48.367
These Tic Tacs have
always brought me luck.

17:48.367 --> 17:49.201
Nice.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.938
- I think I found something.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.272
(mysterious music)

17:53.272 --> 17:55.341
- You, what is it you've-

17:56.375 --> 17:58.210
That is Santino's hat!

18:00.179 --> 18:03.149
He has been texting me
for years about that hat!

18:03.149 --> 18:07.486
It's been in the bowl of
Tic Tacs the whole time!

18:07.486 --> 18:08.854
- What?

18:08.854 --> 18:09.689
- Ooh yes.

18:10.556 --> 18:11.390
Model.

18:12.325 --> 18:13.960
Daya Betty.
(upbeat dance music)

18:13.960 --> 18:14.894
Ooh.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.729
Show me shy pussy.

18:16.729 --> 18:17.563
Shyer.

18:18.397 --> 18:19.432
Oh.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.867
Now show me not so shy pussy.

18:23.202 --> 18:24.437
(RuPaul chuckles)

18:24.437 --> 18:25.371
- At this point,

18:25.371 --> 18:28.541
I just know I look like a
newborn horse.

18:28.541 --> 18:32.011
I don't know what I'm
serving, to be honest.

18:32.011 --> 18:32.878
- [RuPaul] Ooh!

18:32.878 --> 18:35.581
That's some bridge and tunnel
pussy.

18:35.581 --> 18:37.750
Oh my goodness, Lady Camden.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.319
Do you know where those
Tic Tacs have been?

18:40.319 --> 18:42.321
- I've got a sweet tooth,
darling.

18:42.321 --> 18:47.326
(wailing)
(Tic Tacs pouring)

18:47.827 --> 18:50.429
- [RuPaul] It's Tic Tac ecstasy!

18:50.429 --> 18:52.031
- Oh yeah, Tic Tac paddy whack,

18:52.031 --> 18:53.966
give a bitch a bone!

18:53.966 --> 18:57.470
Oh yes!
(RuPaul cackling)

18:57.470 --> 18:59.405
- [RuPaul] Alright
darling, I think we got it.

18:59.405 --> 19:00.673
- Thanks, guys.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.976
- Whoa, the mother load!

19:05.111 --> 19:10.116
(RuPaul cackling)
(Tic Tacs spilling)

19:10.783 --> 19:13.552
My queens.
(queens cheering)

19:13.552 --> 19:15.121
In the Tic Tac photo shoot,

19:15.121 --> 19:18.958
one of you left my mouth
feeling minty fresh.

19:18.958 --> 19:19.992
- [All] Ooh!

19:19.992 --> 19:21.193
- Which is kind of odd,

19:21.193 --> 19:23.496
because the Tic Tacs are orange
flavored.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.231
(all laughing)

19:25.231 --> 19:27.466
The winner of today's mini
challenge is

19:27.466 --> 19:30.369
(drum roll)

19:30.369 --> 19:33.339
Angeria!
(all cheering)

19:33.339 --> 19:35.041
- Oh my god!

19:35.041 --> 19:36.175
It was very important to me

19:36.175 --> 19:38.477
to make a really good
first impression on Ru.

19:38.477 --> 19:40.846
So, pats on the back for Angie.

19:40.846 --> 19:44.417
- [RuPaul] You've won $2500
courtesy of JJ Malibu.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.318
(all cheering)

19:46.318 --> 19:47.420
- Yes, girl!

19:47.420 --> 19:49.522
- Now, my fair lady-kins.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.724
For your very first maxi
challenge,

19:51.724 --> 19:54.193
I'm putting you in the Charisma,

19:54.193 --> 19:56.128
Nerve, and Talent Show.

19:56.128 --> 19:58.697
Where the only thing that's
missing is U.

19:58.697 --> 20:01.801
(all laughing)

20:01.801 --> 20:03.803
This is your chance to show the
world

20:03.803 --> 20:06.172
you are the queen to beat.

20:06.172 --> 20:08.240
- Alright!
(shady music)

20:08.240 --> 20:09.909
- Racers, start your engines,

20:09.909 --> 20:12.411
and may the best drag queen win.

20:12.411 --> 20:14.447
(all cheering, clapping)

20:14.447 --> 20:16.949
- Baby, I am so excited.

20:16.949 --> 20:19.819
We get the chance to
show why we were cast,

20:19.819 --> 20:21.353
and bitch!

20:21.353 --> 20:23.055
I'm ready to kick, split,

20:23.055 --> 20:26.192
and let these judges eat it!

20:26.192 --> 20:27.026
(upbeat music)

20:27.026 --> 20:29.228
- Let me move in, so I
can get out of this shit.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.896
- It is time to de-drag,

20:30.896 --> 20:33.532
and honey, I want to see what
mens

20:33.532 --> 20:35.568
live up under this drag.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.903
- [Jorgeous] I wanna see
who's the trade of the season.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.972
- Oh, you're the trade of
the season, Miss Thing.

20:39.972 --> 20:41.907
- I found two more Tic Tacs.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.576
- Tic Tacs everywhere.

20:43.576 --> 20:47.046
- Tic Tacs still falling out, oh
yeah.

20:47.046 --> 20:48.414
Oh!
(upbeat music)

20:48.414 --> 20:50.049
- I look over at Angeria,

20:50.049 --> 20:51.283
and I'm like, girl,

20:51.283 --> 20:53.953
she's way like cuter and
quirkier

20:53.953 --> 20:55.321
than I pictured her.

20:55.321 --> 20:56.589
(laughing)

20:56.589 --> 20:58.457
- Oh my gosh.

20:58.457 --> 21:01.827
- I was not expecting DeJa to
look like that out of drag.

21:01.827 --> 21:05.297
Honestly, she looks like one of
my tios.

21:05.297 --> 21:07.533
(laughing)

21:10.369 --> 21:11.904
- Uncle Fester's here,
everybody.

21:11.904 --> 21:14.306
- Hi Uncle Fester!
(laughing)

21:14.306 --> 21:15.374
(upbeat music)

21:15.374 --> 21:16.642
- Hello.
- Look at you!

21:16.642 --> 21:18.177
Who is this?

21:18.177 --> 21:19.011
How you doing?

21:19.011 --> 21:20.613
- I'm just passing through,
don't worry.

21:20.613 --> 21:21.947
Don't pay me no nevermind.

21:21.947 --> 21:25.050
- Maddy is looking like a
farmer.

21:25.050 --> 21:26.152
(laughing)
(hillbilly banjo music)

21:26.152 --> 21:30.422
Looks like she owns cattle and
bulls and goats and things.

21:30.422 --> 21:31.290
(laughing)

21:31.290 --> 21:32.958
Y'all look so different.

21:32.958 --> 21:35.261
You never know how much makeup
you have on

21:35.261 --> 21:37.897
until you get out of it.
(laughing)

21:37.897 --> 21:39.365
- Where's Jasmine?
- What?

21:39.365 --> 21:41.333
- Look at my titties.
- I wanna see your titties!

21:41.333 --> 21:42.434
- Oh my god!

21:42.434 --> 21:44.036
- Are yours C or B?

21:44.036 --> 21:45.771
- I've just never touched
real boobies before.

21:45.771 --> 21:47.239
- Are you a gold star, Camden?

21:47.239 --> 21:48.107
- Yeah.

21:48.107 --> 21:49.508
- Who's a gold star?

21:49.508 --> 21:51.076
Are you a gold star gay?

21:51.076 --> 21:52.111
- I don't know, I might be.

21:52.111 --> 21:53.579
I'm not sure what it is.
- Do you know what it is?

21:53.579 --> 21:55.447
A gold star is somebody

21:55.447 --> 21:59.051
that hasn't had sex with the
opposite sex.

21:59.051 --> 22:00.386
- Never slept with a woman.

22:00.386 --> 22:01.754
- Oh, I can't be a gold star.

22:01.754 --> 22:02.888
(laughing)

22:02.888 --> 22:05.691
I wasn't always this gay.
- We're not gold stars.

22:05.691 --> 22:07.459
- Okay, Maddy's not a gold star,
either.

22:07.459 --> 22:09.361
- I'm not a gold- (laughing)

22:09.361 --> 22:10.196
- Yeah.

22:11.197 --> 22:15.201
I know that Maddy identifies
as a straight male.

22:16.235 --> 22:17.937
I don't think this is
anything that's happened

22:17.937 --> 22:20.472
on Drag Race history before,

22:20.472 --> 22:22.675
and when she does bring it up,

22:22.675 --> 22:25.311
these girls are gonna be shook.

22:25.311 --> 22:27.079
(door opens)
(majestic music)

22:27.079 --> 22:29.782
- Hey queens!
(all cheering)

22:29.782 --> 22:31.250
I see you've all moved in.

22:31.250 --> 22:32.251
- [All] Yes!

22:32.251 --> 22:34.353
- Now I've come to collect the
rent.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.289
- Oh shit!
(laughing)

22:37.289 --> 22:39.925
- Angeria Paris VanMichaels.

22:39.925 --> 22:42.361
That's a bougie name, girl.
- Is it?

22:42.361 --> 22:43.362
- You know it is.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.930
- It ain't bougie at all.

22:44.930 --> 22:46.198
(laughing)

22:46.198 --> 22:47.399
- [RuPaul] Where does that name
come from?

22:47.399 --> 22:49.368
- It came from a girl
I went to college with.

22:49.368 --> 22:50.736
She was real pretty.
- Uh huh.

22:50.736 --> 22:52.671
- And I was like, I want your
name.

22:52.671 --> 22:54.373
But her name was Angera.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.608
- Angera.
- Yeah.

22:55.608 --> 22:57.676
- And you changed it to Angeria.

22:57.676 --> 22:58.510
- 'Cause in the South,

22:58.510 --> 23:00.246
when you want the name
to sound more special,

23:00.246 --> 23:01.714
you add a I in front of the A.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.582
(RuPaul laughing)

23:03.582 --> 23:05.084
- So, now what's your talent?

23:05.084 --> 23:08.187
- I am doing original track.

23:08.187 --> 23:09.822
- Original track?
- Yes.

23:09.822 --> 23:11.690
- Will my ears bleed?

23:11.690 --> 23:13.392
- No, I don't think so.

23:13.392 --> 23:14.693
- Do you know how to sing?
- Yes.

23:14.693 --> 23:16.061
- Because you grew up in the
church.

23:16.061 --> 23:18.597
- I grew up in the church,
and I sung in the choir.

23:18.597 --> 23:21.133
(laughing)

23:21.133 --> 23:22.434
- Being from the Midwest,

23:22.434 --> 23:24.270
we do have a lot of pageant
girls,

23:24.270 --> 23:26.372
and so those are the
girls that intimidate me.

23:26.372 --> 23:28.107
The girls that are really put
together.

23:28.107 --> 23:28.974
- So I'm gonna let you go,

23:28.974 --> 23:30.542
but I could talk to you all day.

23:30.542 --> 23:32.378
(both laughing)

23:32.378 --> 23:34.980
- And Ru just laughs at
everything Angeria says.

23:34.980 --> 23:37.082
So keeping an eye on her.

23:38.917 --> 23:41.487
- Alright Daya Betty, come on
over.

23:41.487 --> 23:42.888
- Hi Ru.
- Hi, honey.

23:42.888 --> 23:44.790
I wanted to ask you
how'd you get that name?

23:44.790 --> 23:45.858
- 'Cause I'm diabetic.

23:45.858 --> 23:47.559
Type one, not type two.

23:47.559 --> 23:49.928
- How does that affect
you in your daily life?

23:49.928 --> 23:52.331
- So, if I do any, like, crazy
activities,

23:52.331 --> 23:53.465
like I'll be doing here,

23:53.465 --> 23:56.068
I'll just have to check
my blood sugar more.

23:56.068 --> 23:58.070
- And if it's too low, will you
pass out?

23:58.070 --> 24:00.606
- I will do a unwanted death
drop.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.374
- Well, we'll be on the lookout.

24:02.374 --> 24:04.109
- Yes.
- So, what's your talent?

24:04.109 --> 24:06.011
- I'm gonna be doing a lip sync,

24:06.011 --> 24:07.146
with a little-
- Wait a minute.

24:07.146 --> 24:09.515
A lip sync?
- I know, revolutionary.

24:09.515 --> 24:10.683
- On a drag show?

24:10.683 --> 24:12.217
- I know, crazy, right?
- It's crazy.

24:12.217 --> 24:13.852
Is it to your own song?

24:13.852 --> 24:17.289
- No, it's to Pink's
"Get The Party Started."

24:17.289 --> 24:21.026
- Okay, well what do you
think you lip syncing Pink

24:21.026 --> 24:22.995
will let us know about you?

24:22.995 --> 24:24.096
- That song in particular,

24:24.096 --> 24:27.266
it's just about having fun,
and you know, doing you.

24:27.266 --> 24:29.601
- Yeah, but what does
it say about Daya Betty?

24:29.601 --> 24:31.437
- It says that she's a
little edgy, you know,

24:31.437 --> 24:33.939
but she also knows she knows
she can turn the party.

24:33.939 --> 24:37.609
- Yeah, no, I'm just saying
that the judges will ask that.

24:37.609 --> 24:39.745
This is the first time we get to
know you.

24:39.745 --> 24:42.381
How does that inform us who you
are?

24:42.381 --> 24:44.049
But you know, we'll see.

24:44.049 --> 24:46.118
- Ru doesn't really seem too
impressed

24:46.118 --> 24:47.886
that my talent's lip syncing.

24:47.886 --> 24:48.687
- Alright.

24:48.687 --> 24:51.323
- So it's gotta be the best
lip sync Ru's ever seen,

24:51.323 --> 24:53.592
or I'm gonna be in trouble.

24:54.727 --> 24:57.129
- Alright, Lady Camden.
(upbeat music)

24:57.129 --> 24:57.963
- Hello.

24:57.963 --> 24:59.965
- Now, I can tell you're a
dancer.

24:59.965 --> 25:02.201
How old were you when you
started dancing?

25:02.201 --> 25:05.137
- I was always dancing in my
bedroom to the Spice Girls

25:05.137 --> 25:06.805
as a little gay boy.
- Yes.

25:06.805 --> 25:10.075
- But I started doing ballet
classes and stuff at like 12.

25:10.075 --> 25:11.643
- So what's your talent?

25:11.643 --> 25:12.978
Is it going to be dance?

25:12.978 --> 25:14.446
- It is going to be dance.

25:14.446 --> 25:15.948
- Uh huh.
- I'm gonna bring a mix

25:15.948 --> 25:19.084
of classical ballet with
some more of the dancing

25:19.084 --> 25:20.719
that I've evolved into now.

25:20.719 --> 25:21.754
- Huh, you know what?

25:21.754 --> 25:24.223
I've gone to the ballet
maybe once or twice.

25:24.223 --> 25:26.825
And remember I didn't enjoy it.

25:28.761 --> 25:31.463
Because it was just boring.

25:31.463 --> 25:32.698
You know, to me.

25:32.698 --> 25:34.366
- Oh god.

25:34.366 --> 25:37.870
I don't want Ru to fall
asleep during my number.

25:37.870 --> 25:40.806
Have I picked the wrong
thing to do for him?

25:40.806 --> 25:44.176
- Listen, we're looking for
elevated.

25:44.176 --> 25:46.812
Give it the old Lady Camden
twist.

25:46.812 --> 25:48.013
- Okay, I will.

25:48.013 --> 25:50.983
- Alright, thank you darling.
- Thank you, Ru.

25:50.983 --> 25:53.252
- Alright DeJa Skye, come on
over.

25:53.252 --> 25:55.354
- Hi Ru.
- Hi DeJa.

25:55.354 --> 25:56.989
I am so happy you're here.

25:56.989 --> 25:59.191
You know, because your
audition reel was one

25:59.191 --> 26:01.026
that I really, really enjoyed.

26:01.026 --> 26:02.461
- Really?
- Because you know,

26:02.461 --> 26:04.663
you're an old, you're an old...

26:04.663 --> 26:05.764
- She called me old.

26:05.764 --> 26:08.267
- No, now, no, you didn't
let me finish the sentence.

26:08.267 --> 26:11.637
You're an old school
queen that I really enjoy.

26:11.637 --> 26:13.138
So now what's your talent?

26:13.138 --> 26:15.441
- So I'm gonna teach you
how to be a cheerleader

26:15.441 --> 26:17.109
in three easy steps.

26:17.109 --> 26:21.113
- Okay, what does a cheerleading
routine tell us about you?

26:21.113 --> 26:22.548
- It's kinda my sense of humor.

26:22.548 --> 26:24.183
And it also is very much my
background.

26:24.183 --> 26:25.784
Besides a drag queen,

26:25.784 --> 26:28.053
I'm actually a choreographer
for cheer and dance.

26:28.053 --> 26:30.956
- Wow, I'm actually
looking forward to that.

26:30.956 --> 26:32.858
- I think DeJa is gonna be my
competition

26:32.858 --> 26:34.460
because I'm also a cheerleader,

26:34.460 --> 26:37.596
and I want to see how she
makes it a comedic relief.

26:37.596 --> 26:38.430
- Thank you.

26:38.430 --> 26:41.767
- Where I'm incorporating
back handsprings, round kicks.

26:41.767 --> 26:42.935
Like who doesn't love to see a
girl

26:42.935 --> 26:44.770
do a back handspring into a
split?

26:44.770 --> 26:46.305
- Maddy Morphosis.

26:46.305 --> 26:47.406
- Hi Ru.

26:47.406 --> 26:48.874
- Now, I don't hear a southern
accent.

26:48.874 --> 26:50.876
- No, I'm from Arkansas,

26:50.876 --> 26:55.080
but I try to not be as
Arkansas as humanly possible.

26:55.080 --> 26:56.448
- What is your talent?

26:56.448 --> 26:57.716
- I'm gonna play guitar.

26:57.716 --> 26:58.951
- Live music?

26:58.951 --> 27:01.220
- Yes.
- Very risky!

27:01.220 --> 27:03.822
You know, here, it's gotta
be something special.

27:03.822 --> 27:05.090
You know, if you do a straight,

27:05.090 --> 27:08.894
I'm doing something that is
just everyday normal thing,

27:08.894 --> 27:11.196
it's gotta have kind of a
twisted edge where we go,

27:11.196 --> 27:12.664
oh my goodness.

27:12.664 --> 27:13.999
Just make it special.

27:13.999 --> 27:15.567
Now, you have made history

27:15.567 --> 27:18.103
being our first straight
contestant.

27:18.103 --> 27:20.772
(ominous music)

27:22.374 --> 27:23.876
- Wait, what?

27:23.876 --> 27:24.910
- Right.

27:24.910 --> 27:27.079
- Whoa, Maddy is straight?

27:28.780 --> 27:30.883
- Now, are you afraid
that when you leave here,

27:30.883 --> 27:32.417
you won't be straight?

27:32.417 --> 27:33.619
- No.
(laughing)

27:33.619 --> 27:34.753
- What?

27:34.753 --> 27:36.455
- A straight drag queen.

27:36.455 --> 27:39.858
Wow, that's, that's something
new.

27:39.858 --> 27:41.326
(laughing)

27:41.326 --> 27:43.228
- So, how did you get into drag?

27:43.228 --> 27:45.764
- I grew up watching "To
Wong Foo" with my grandma,

27:45.764 --> 27:47.499
and that kind of put the bug in
my head,

27:47.499 --> 27:50.802
and I developed an interest in
fashion and makeup and stuff,

27:50.802 --> 27:52.671
but that's not something you can
express

27:52.671 --> 27:55.274
when you grow up in
population 1200 Lincoln.

27:55.274 --> 27:56.108
- Right.
- And so like,

27:56.108 --> 27:57.442
when I got out of high school,

27:57.442 --> 27:59.044
I moved to a slightly bigger
city

27:59.044 --> 28:00.679
where it just happened to have
drag shows.

28:00.679 --> 28:03.081
And I just did it.
- And you had the cheekbones.

28:03.081 --> 28:04.650
- And I had the cheekbones.

28:04.650 --> 28:06.518
- I'm so impressed with you.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.587
- Thank you.
- Because you are someone

28:08.587 --> 28:09.721
who says you know what?

28:09.721 --> 28:11.590
That interests me, I'm gonna get
into it.

28:11.590 --> 28:14.226
And you're gonna go very far in
this life.

28:14.226 --> 28:15.327
- Thank you.
- Let's hope you go

28:15.327 --> 28:17.329
very far in this competition.

28:17.329 --> 28:18.163
- To have Ru tell me that

28:18.163 --> 28:19.431
makes me feel a lot more
validated.

28:19.431 --> 28:20.766
It just feels almost like,

28:20.766 --> 28:22.267
a weight off my shoulders.

28:22.267 --> 28:24.069
I think this is like a community
of people

28:24.069 --> 28:27.239
that is built around love and
acceptance.

28:27.239 --> 28:29.107
- Alright thank you.
- Thank you, Ru.

28:29.107 --> 28:30.742
But I just have this little
nervous thing of, you know,

28:30.742 --> 28:32.978
what if there's one person
that's not down with it,

28:32.978 --> 28:34.146
that's not okay with it.

28:34.146 --> 28:36.882
There have been a couple
negative opinions here and
there,

28:36.882 --> 28:38.550
and I'm really worried
that a negative opinion

28:38.550 --> 28:40.385
might be in this room.

28:41.787 --> 28:43.956
- Alright, gather 'round,
queens.

28:43.956 --> 28:47.259
Now tomorrow, joining us
will be our extra special

28:47.259 --> 28:48.694
guest judge,

28:48.694 --> 28:50.629
the amazing Alicia Keys.

28:50.629 --> 28:54.132
(all screaming in excitement)

28:54.132 --> 28:57.402
- (laughing) Alicia Keys!

28:57.402 --> 28:59.004
I love Alicia Keys.

29:00.372 --> 29:04.509
- Oh, and last but not
least, a friendly reminder,

29:04.509 --> 29:06.511
that by the end of tomorrow,

29:06.511 --> 29:09.948
I'll be asking one of you to
sashay away.

29:11.216 --> 29:14.286
So whatever you do, don't fuck
it up.

29:17.122 --> 29:19.157
(upbeat dance music)

29:19.157 --> 29:20.559
(all laughing)

29:20.559 --> 29:23.028
- Oh my god, we did it.

29:23.028 --> 29:24.830
- Today is the day we're
performing our talent

29:24.830 --> 29:25.664
in front of the judges,

29:25.664 --> 29:28.767
and I'm trying so hard
to just stay focused,

29:28.767 --> 29:30.402
but it's hard not to get really
nervous

29:30.402 --> 29:32.537
because RuPaul's gonna
be there looking at me

29:32.537 --> 29:34.172
with her eyeballs.

29:34.172 --> 29:35.307
Like, what?

29:35.307 --> 29:36.808
(upbeat music)

29:36.808 --> 29:38.343
- How long does it usually take
everyone

29:38.343 --> 29:39.678
to do their makeup?

29:39.678 --> 29:41.713
- I can do it in like
45 if I really need to.

29:41.713 --> 29:43.015
- I'm normally like a three
hour-

29:43.015 --> 29:44.182
- Three hours?

29:45.083 --> 29:47.786
- But I can do it for like,
an hour and a half or so.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.988
- Because I've been doing
this for so many years,

29:49.988 --> 29:51.623
I've seen plenty of queens.

29:51.623 --> 29:54.493
I'm just gagged that Maddy is
straight.

29:54.493 --> 29:56.795
I don't know any straight drag
queens.

29:56.795 --> 30:00.432
It's crazy to me that
you identify as straight.

30:00.432 --> 30:02.034
- Oh god, here we go.

30:02.034 --> 30:03.502
I do, yes.

30:03.502 --> 30:04.536
I mean, honestly like,

30:04.536 --> 30:05.971
it's not something that I lead
with,

30:05.971 --> 30:07.506
because it's something I don't
want

30:07.506 --> 30:09.274
other people to like, base their
opinion

30:09.274 --> 30:11.209
around my sexuality first.

30:11.209 --> 30:12.244
Might be a fun fact,

30:12.244 --> 30:13.879
but I don't want it to be what
everyone

30:13.879 --> 30:15.313
thinks of.
- Defines you.

30:15.313 --> 30:17.783
- I've never met a
straight drag queen before!

30:17.783 --> 30:21.486
To be a fully fledged drag
queen and be straight is like,

30:21.486 --> 30:22.554
crazy to me.

30:22.554 --> 30:24.756
It kinda makes me have
mad respect for her.

30:24.756 --> 30:26.358
Maddy respect for her.
(bell dings)

30:26.358 --> 30:29.094
Because you've gotta be really
comfortable

30:29.094 --> 30:30.529
with your heterosexuality

30:30.529 --> 30:32.597
to be able to tuck all that shit
back,

30:32.597 --> 30:34.032
put on a wig,

30:34.032 --> 30:35.400
and gack gitty gack.

30:35.400 --> 30:38.904
Like, that's like, good
for you, babes, you know?

30:38.904 --> 30:41.473
- I have never met another
straight drag queen before.

30:41.473 --> 30:42.941
And I think a big part of
it is just 'cause like,

30:42.941 --> 30:45.610
guys are like, so worried about

30:45.610 --> 30:47.179
expressing femininity,

30:47.179 --> 30:49.181
or being seen-
- It's toxic masculinity.

30:49.181 --> 30:50.615
- Yeah, or even like,

30:50.615 --> 30:52.250
being scared of people
thinking that they're gay.

30:52.250 --> 30:53.985
Growing up in Arkansas,
whenever I was younger,

30:53.985 --> 30:55.620
I thought it was illegal to be
gay.

30:55.620 --> 30:56.455
I didn't even know.

30:56.455 --> 30:57.622
I didn't know a single gay
person.

30:57.622 --> 30:59.024
- Yeah.
- But then seeing people

30:59.024 --> 31:00.392
moving to a bigger city,

31:00.392 --> 31:02.227
and seeing people just
living their authentic lives

31:02.227 --> 31:04.296
and just like not worrying
about what people think of them.

31:04.296 --> 31:06.665
And it just made me realize
that I can live my own life

31:06.665 --> 31:07.966
like that too, and just, you
know,

31:07.966 --> 31:09.768
we only have one life to live.
- One life to live.

31:09.768 --> 31:11.236
You better live it
authentically.

31:11.236 --> 31:15.440
- I think it's sickening that
Maddy is a heterosexual man

31:15.440 --> 31:17.375
from a small town in the South,

31:17.375 --> 31:22.380
and wants to be a sickening
drag queen all at the same time.

31:22.380 --> 31:26.251
I mean, hey, nobody ever
said it couldn't be done.

31:26.251 --> 31:28.053
(upbeat music)

31:28.053 --> 31:29.020
- How's everyone feeling

31:29.020 --> 31:31.189
knowing we're gonna get
to walk down the runway

31:31.189 --> 31:33.525
for the first time?
- I know!

31:33.525 --> 31:36.094
- Hopefully nobody trips.
(laughing)

31:36.094 --> 31:37.963
- [Alicia] Hey queens.

31:37.963 --> 31:39.397
- What?
- Huh?

31:39.397 --> 31:42.667
(suspenseful music)

31:42.667 --> 31:44.202
(all screaming)

31:44.202 --> 31:45.637
- Guys, it's Alicia!

31:45.637 --> 31:47.439
- Oh my god!
- Hi!

31:47.439 --> 31:49.174
(all cheering)

31:49.174 --> 31:50.408
- Is that...no.

31:51.710 --> 31:55.347
No.
(all laughing)

31:55.347 --> 31:56.181
- Woo!

31:56.181 --> 31:58.550
When you talk about
dreams coming true, child,

31:58.550 --> 32:00.852
like, it is literally a dream
for me

32:00.852 --> 32:03.054
to meet Alicia Keys.

32:03.054 --> 32:04.956
- Hi!
- [All] hi!

32:04.956 --> 32:05.824
- I just wanted you to know

32:05.824 --> 32:07.359
that I'm so excited,

32:07.359 --> 32:09.394
and I'm so proud of you.

32:09.394 --> 32:11.129
And I can't believe we're
together!

32:11.129 --> 32:12.564
(all cheering)

32:12.564 --> 32:14.633
And we're gonna show them what
it is!

32:14.633 --> 32:15.734
- [All] Yes!

32:15.734 --> 32:17.803
- The reason why you inspire me

32:17.803 --> 32:21.740
is because I feel like
we should not hold back.

32:21.740 --> 32:23.275
We should be able to be as bold

32:23.275 --> 32:25.343
and as brave and as big

32:25.343 --> 32:28.180
and as powerful as we want to
be.

32:28.180 --> 32:30.649
So don't let anybody hold you
back.

32:30.649 --> 32:31.950
This is your time,

32:31.950 --> 32:34.085
this is your moment,

32:34.085 --> 32:35.620
and you are going to show
everyone

32:35.620 --> 32:37.689
just how special and amazing you
are.

32:37.689 --> 32:40.358
So go smash the whole situation!

32:41.226 --> 32:44.062
(all cheering, clapping)

32:44.062 --> 32:45.864
- Love you!
(smooching)

32:45.864 --> 32:49.067
(all cheering)

43:04.916 --> 43:05.750
DeJa Skye.

43:06.884 --> 43:09.654
Welcome to the main stage
of RuPaul's Drag Lace.

43:09.654 --> 43:11.589
(judges chuckle)

43:11.589 --> 43:13.591
- [DeJa] This look
represents me to the fullest

43:13.591 --> 43:16.594
because I am showing
every swerve and curve

43:16.594 --> 43:18.996
of this big billowy body.

43:18.996 --> 43:20.998
I look at Alicia and she just
goes-

43:20.998 --> 43:21.833
- Yes!

43:22.867 --> 43:24.368
- [Carson] It's curtains for
her.

43:24.368 --> 43:25.970
(judges laugh)

43:25.970 --> 43:29.073
- [Michelle] They call her
Sleevey Wonder.

43:29.073 --> 43:31.042
- [RuPaul] Jasmine Kennedie.

43:31.042 --> 43:32.743
Listen hon, you're gonna
put somebody's eyes out

43:32.743 --> 43:34.111
with those things.

43:34.111 --> 43:36.747
- [Jasmine] I decided to
go with something gold,

43:36.747 --> 43:38.816
and I have my titties out.

43:38.816 --> 43:41.786
I have a little applique to show
them

43:41.786 --> 43:43.855
that I do what, drag.

43:43.855 --> 43:45.590
- [Michelle] Gorge Washington.

43:45.590 --> 43:48.392
(judges laugh)

43:48.392 --> 43:49.327
I'll do it better.

43:49.327 --> 43:51.295
Gorge W. Bush.

43:51.295 --> 43:54.131
(RuPaul cackling)

43:56.667 --> 43:58.903
- [RuPaul] Maddy Morphosis.

44:00.004 --> 44:01.405
What!
- Oh my god!

44:03.140 --> 44:03.975
- [Carson] I really like

44:03.975 --> 44:04.976
the neckline on this.

44:04.976 --> 44:06.444
- [RuPaul] Yeah, it's really
good.

44:06.444 --> 44:07.712
- [Maddy] I am giving a
signature

44:07.712 --> 44:09.981
Maddy Morphosis look, from neck
to toe,

44:09.981 --> 44:12.550
in this beautiful Marie
Antoinette number.

44:12.550 --> 44:15.186
I'm like tossing my
head around like a prop.

44:15.186 --> 44:16.554
- What!
(Michelle laughing)

44:16.554 --> 44:18.356
- It's campy, it's stupid,

44:18.356 --> 44:20.458
but it's also beautiful.

44:20.458 --> 44:22.727
- [RuPaul] Ladies and
gentlemen, Guillotina Turner.

44:22.727 --> 44:24.362
(Michelle laughs)

44:24.362 --> 44:25.630
- [Alicia] Chin up, sweetie!

44:25.630 --> 44:28.900
(judges laugh)

44:28.900 --> 44:29.767
- [RuPaul] I'm coming down

44:29.767 --> 44:33.170
with a case of Angeria Paris
VanMichaels.

44:34.839 --> 44:37.074
Come on, Sparta, Georgia.

44:37.074 --> 44:38.976
- This is my first time,

44:38.976 --> 44:41.412
and I'm feeling fine like wine.

44:41.412 --> 44:43.080
My dress is wine.

44:43.080 --> 44:44.782
When you think of Angeria,

44:44.782 --> 44:48.686
I want you to think of pure
pageant glamor

44:48.686 --> 44:50.955
from my head to my toes, bitch.

44:50.955 --> 44:51.789
- Yes!

44:52.757 --> 44:54.926
Burgundy-licious.

44:54.926 --> 44:56.894
- [Michelle] Time to
get the party Sparted.

44:56.894 --> 44:59.063
(RuPaul giggles)

44:59.063 --> 44:59.897
Okay that was a stretch.

44:59.897 --> 45:01.399
- That was rotten.

45:02.233 --> 45:03.634
Lady Camden.

45:03.634 --> 45:04.468
- [Carson] Oh my god,

45:04.468 --> 45:05.736
she just peacock blocked me.

45:05.736 --> 45:06.871
(RuPaul chuckles)

45:06.871 --> 45:07.872
- [Lady Camden] My look is
inspired

45:07.872 --> 45:11.676
by Camdentown raver girls back
in the 90s.

45:11.676 --> 45:14.078
I love to be bold with my drag,

45:14.078 --> 45:17.048
and always something that is
a little bit of a surprise.

45:17.048 --> 45:17.882
- Hey pa!

45:19.317 --> 45:20.318
- I'm here to let you know

45:20.318 --> 45:21.786
I'm about to take flight,

45:21.786 --> 45:24.355
even though I don't know
if peacocks actually fly.

45:24.355 --> 45:25.189
They do fly!

45:25.189 --> 45:27.258
So I'm here to fly, okay great.

45:27.258 --> 45:28.459
- [Michelle] What's her mating
call?

45:28.459 --> 45:29.860
- [RuPaul] I don't know.

45:29.860 --> 45:30.962
(Michelle squawks)

45:30.962 --> 45:33.764
(judges laughing)

45:34.765 --> 45:35.666
Daya Betty.

45:36.634 --> 45:37.768
- Yes.

45:37.768 --> 45:38.603
- [RuPaul] I'm sorry.

45:38.603 --> 45:39.971
Daya Betty can't come
to the phone right now,

45:39.971 --> 45:41.472
she's all tied up.

45:42.340 --> 45:45.076
- [Daya] I'm hobbling down
the runway in my hobble dress.

45:45.076 --> 45:47.378
The fact that the entire outfit

45:47.378 --> 45:50.615
is held to my body by ribbons

45:50.615 --> 45:54.685
is so dainty and scary at the
same time.

45:54.685 --> 45:56.887
I feel like I am serving it.

45:56.887 --> 45:58.923
- [Carson] It's ribbon, for your
pleasure.

45:58.923 --> 46:01.292
- [RuPaul] Oh, thank you for
considering.

46:01.292 --> 46:06.130
- [Alicia] There's a ribbon
in the sky for her drag.

46:06.130 --> 46:07.898
- Welcome, queens.
(suspenseful music)

46:07.898 --> 46:10.935
It's time for the judges'
critiques.

46:10.935 --> 46:12.937
Up first, Jorgeous.

46:12.937 --> 46:15.106
- I just have to say, just
Jorgeous!

46:15.106 --> 46:16.407
- Oh thank you.

46:16.407 --> 46:18.109
- I love the stones on the mesh.

46:18.109 --> 46:20.177
I love all those different
amethyst tones.

46:20.177 --> 46:22.213
The makeup is like air brushed.

46:22.213 --> 46:23.648
(bell dings)
(RuPaul laughs)

46:23.648 --> 46:26.017
- What I loved about you is your
energy.

46:26.017 --> 46:27.652
I do think the song choice,

46:27.652 --> 46:29.353
it was a lot of standing
and just doing this

46:29.353 --> 46:30.521
before we got into it.

46:30.521 --> 46:32.189
For you, I think your plan of
attack

46:32.189 --> 46:33.724
should always be right out the
gate.

46:33.724 --> 46:35.726
- As a performer, I
felt confidence from you

46:35.726 --> 46:37.328
that just did not quit.

46:37.328 --> 46:38.896
I just love and I live.

46:38.896 --> 46:41.265
- Is that a number you
perform in your nightclub act?

46:41.265 --> 46:42.466
- Oh yes, I legit,

46:42.466 --> 46:43.801
ever since that song came out,

46:43.801 --> 46:45.636
legit, ever since I was 16,

46:45.636 --> 46:47.238
I've been performing it ever
since.

46:47.238 --> 46:49.173
- Every time you mention
how young you are,

46:49.173 --> 46:50.574
I'm gonna take marks off.

46:50.574 --> 46:51.809
- Oh my god, no!

46:51.809 --> 46:53.077
No, please!
- Legit.

46:53.077 --> 46:55.212
(all laughing)

46:55.212 --> 46:57.548
- Up next, DeJa Skye.

46:57.548 --> 46:59.216
- This number on the runway,

46:59.216 --> 47:00.584
I love the color.

47:00.584 --> 47:01.986
Cerulean.

47:01.986 --> 47:03.921
Oh my gosh, I didn't even
realize.

47:03.921 --> 47:05.956
I'm wearing it too!
(all laughing)

47:05.956 --> 47:07.858
Job well done on the runway
look.

47:07.858 --> 47:08.693
- Thank you.

47:08.693 --> 47:10.861
- Your routine was brave,

47:10.861 --> 47:12.863
because you wanted to
do something different.

47:12.863 --> 47:14.231
We saw a lot of lip syncing
tonight,

47:14.231 --> 47:15.466
and you stood out.

47:15.466 --> 47:18.903
I'm not sure if it was
for all the right reasons.

47:18.903 --> 47:21.038
Because it really wasn't funny.

47:21.038 --> 47:22.173
- We're doing a drag show.

47:22.173 --> 47:23.841
You know, just don't
give it to me straight.

47:23.841 --> 47:25.476
Give it to me a little bit from
the side,

47:25.476 --> 47:26.477
a little bit from behind.

47:26.477 --> 47:27.611
Well, a whole lot from behind.

47:27.611 --> 47:28.946
- A lot.
(laughing)

47:28.946 --> 47:31.215
- And then hit me over the head
with it.

47:31.215 --> 47:33.918
Up next, Jasmine Kennedie.

47:33.918 --> 47:35.286
- The dance number, you were
doing like,

47:35.286 --> 47:36.787
ice skating maneuvers.

47:36.787 --> 47:39.857
Like a triple sow cow, or a
half Charles Nelson Reilly.

47:39.857 --> 47:42.259
You were in the air,
spinning around and like,

47:42.259 --> 47:44.428
this bitch doesn't even have
skates on.

47:44.428 --> 47:46.397
How did you make that happen?
(all laughing)

47:46.397 --> 47:48.399
That was beautiful.

47:48.399 --> 47:49.967
- You're a pageant girl.
- Yes.

47:49.967 --> 47:51.836
- I have two words for you, the
queen.

47:51.836 --> 47:53.471
You're giving us 60s drag.

47:53.471 --> 47:54.939
And I love it.

47:54.939 --> 47:57.942
- This look is like
body-ody-ody!

47:57.942 --> 48:00.144
I was like, my god, what is
happening?

48:00.144 --> 48:03.347
- Sorry, I'm just focused
on your two tig old bitties.

48:03.347 --> 48:05.116
(all laughing)

48:05.116 --> 48:06.717
You look like Edie Williams

48:06.717 --> 48:09.253
from Beyond the Valley of the
Dolls,

48:09.253 --> 48:11.622
and Alyssa Edwards had a baby.

48:11.622 --> 48:13.257
- Yeah.
- And here she is.

48:13.257 --> 48:14.358
I love it.

48:14.358 --> 48:16.093
- Thank you so much.

48:16.093 --> 48:18.996
- Up next, Maddy Morphosis.

48:18.996 --> 48:19.964
- Hi.

48:19.964 --> 48:22.166
- This is something I've never
seen

48:22.166 --> 48:24.235
on the main stage before.

48:24.235 --> 48:26.771
It's so stupid.
(judges laughing)

48:26.771 --> 48:28.139
Even though it's a costume,

48:28.139 --> 48:29.874
it's full on crazy drag.

48:29.874 --> 48:30.841
Like, I love this.

48:30.841 --> 48:32.843
I can see that you need
some help with your makeup.

48:32.843 --> 48:33.944
Just little tweaks here and
there

48:33.944 --> 48:35.479
is gonna help you go a long way.

48:35.479 --> 48:36.747
- But this is really fun.

48:36.747 --> 48:38.682
You should really hold your head
high.

48:38.682 --> 48:40.084
(all laughing)

48:40.084 --> 48:41.285
Or right there at your waist.

48:41.285 --> 48:42.553
(laughing)

48:42.553 --> 48:44.355
- I was so happy to
hear you play the Blues.

48:44.355 --> 48:47.892
I was like, ooh, got some taste
and some vibe and some zone.

48:47.892 --> 48:50.127
- Did you play the electric
guitar with your tongue?

48:50.127 --> 48:51.061
- I did, yeah.

48:51.061 --> 48:53.330
- That was like a bonus talent.

48:53.330 --> 48:55.499
But I wasn't really
sure what was happening.

48:55.499 --> 48:58.302
So I would say work the
camera, work your audience.

48:58.302 --> 48:59.503
Invite us in.

48:59.503 --> 49:01.906
- You gotta have more of
an angle in a drag show.

49:01.906 --> 49:04.375
Had you played the guitar with
your penis,

49:04.375 --> 49:07.178
then we'd be talking a different
story.

49:07.178 --> 49:08.813
- No, no!
- Oh, I'm hearing in,

49:08.813 --> 49:10.381
oh, we've been canceled.

49:10.381 --> 49:11.916
Okay, is my Uber here?

49:11.916 --> 49:13.818
(all laughing)

49:13.818 --> 49:15.986
Next up, Angeria.

49:15.986 --> 49:17.321
- This runway look,

49:17.321 --> 49:22.059
you're giving us Atlanta
G-A-Y pageant perfection.

49:22.059 --> 49:23.127
- I love this dress.

49:23.127 --> 49:25.229
It is so Miss Dominique
Devereux.

49:25.229 --> 49:26.931
- Yes.
- Thank you.

49:26.931 --> 49:28.232
- Call me Angie?

49:28.232 --> 49:29.733
Call me an ambulance.

49:29.733 --> 49:32.369
I almost slipped a disc just
watching it.

49:32.369 --> 49:34.839
At the end when you did
that perfect death drop.

49:34.839 --> 49:36.407
- I was like, oh my god, I love
this!

49:36.407 --> 49:38.075
It was so good.

49:38.075 --> 49:40.611
Sometimes very tricky
to do original songs,

49:40.611 --> 49:42.346
but that was a good one right
there.

49:42.346 --> 49:43.447
You did that.

49:43.447 --> 49:45.449
- I don't mean to get
emotional or nothing,

49:45.449 --> 49:49.220
but the female vocalist that's
always lived inside of me

49:49.220 --> 49:51.889
has always been inspired by you.

49:52.990 --> 49:54.792
Always, always.
- Oh my god, I love it.

49:54.792 --> 49:57.928
- So this just feels amazing.

49:57.928 --> 50:00.531
- Up next, Lady Camden.

50:00.531 --> 50:01.932
- You came out and you
said, "I'm a ballerina,

50:01.932 --> 50:04.068
but I'm gonna toss my ballet
shoes away.

50:04.068 --> 50:06.437
I'm gonna do ballet the drag
way."

50:06.437 --> 50:07.504
That was fabulous.

50:07.504 --> 50:09.607
- This look tonight is adorable.

50:09.607 --> 50:11.175
I love the tail.

50:11.175 --> 50:14.778
- I definitely can see
all of your personality.

50:14.778 --> 50:17.181
Nothing else looks like how you
look.

50:17.181 --> 50:19.383
It is like a favorite Pokemon
character.

50:19.383 --> 50:21.785
So I think that we're in
for like a really good time

50:21.785 --> 50:22.853
when we're hanging with you.

50:22.853 --> 50:25.689
- Thank you so much, Alicia.
- Absolutely, well done.

50:25.689 --> 50:28.092
- Up next, Daya Betty.

50:28.092 --> 50:29.627
- This look has a very, like,

50:29.627 --> 50:31.528
English punk kind of vibe.

50:31.528 --> 50:34.164
We did notice that the back,
it's poppin',

50:34.164 --> 50:35.866
but it's for the wrong reasons.

50:35.866 --> 50:36.700
It's ripped.

50:36.700 --> 50:37.534
- I'm taking a guess here

50:37.534 --> 50:39.069
that you are in the Crystal
Methyd family.

50:39.069 --> 50:40.838
- Oh yes, I am.
- Because I can see it

50:40.838 --> 50:42.606
in your face.
- Woo!

50:42.606 --> 50:44.241
- You were another lip sync.

50:44.241 --> 50:46.844
It was pretty kind of
lackluster.

50:46.844 --> 50:48.879
We lip sync for your life here
every week.

50:48.879 --> 50:49.713
You'll have to do something

50:49.713 --> 50:51.148
that's gonna make us gag.

50:51.148 --> 50:52.416
- You did a good job,

50:52.416 --> 50:55.920
but I didn't get enough of
your personality from it.

50:55.920 --> 50:59.723
I still don't quite know who you
are.

50:59.723 --> 51:03.827
And that's really the
purpose of the talent show.

51:05.095 --> 51:05.930
Thank you, ladies.

51:05.930 --> 51:07.464
I think we've heard enough.

51:07.464 --> 51:09.633
While you untuck in the Werk
Room,

51:09.633 --> 51:12.937
the judges and I will
deliberate.

51:12.937 --> 51:13.904
(engine revs)

51:13.904 --> 51:16.040
Alright now just between
us squirrel friends,

51:16.040 --> 51:18.008
what do you think?

51:18.008 --> 51:20.044
Let's start with Jorgeous.

51:20.044 --> 51:22.880
- I think this one is gonna
sway us with her personality.

51:22.880 --> 51:26.083
She feels every bit of herself
in drag.

51:26.083 --> 51:28.218
Everything she does has a
flourish.

51:28.218 --> 51:30.754
Everything has a, uh huh, I am
fab.

51:30.754 --> 51:31.822
(RuPaul laughs)

51:31.822 --> 51:33.123
- Maybe her lip singing could
have

51:33.123 --> 51:34.391
been a little bit tighter,

51:34.391 --> 51:35.993
but I think she's a fearless
performer.

51:35.993 --> 51:37.061
I really like her.

51:37.061 --> 51:38.128
- [RuPaul] DeJa Skye.

51:38.128 --> 51:40.998
- I was very excited
when I saw her walk out,

51:40.998 --> 51:42.700
and you know, giving us a cheer
routine.

51:42.700 --> 51:44.435
I love "Bring It On."
(laughing)

51:44.435 --> 51:45.703
But brr, it's cold in here.

51:45.703 --> 51:48.639
There are no jokes in this
atmosphere.

51:48.639 --> 51:51.108
- Tonight's performance did not
land.

51:51.108 --> 51:52.209
(DeJa grunts)

51:52.209 --> 51:53.344
Jasmine Kennedie.

51:53.344 --> 51:55.045
- Jasmine is phenomenal.

51:55.045 --> 51:57.614
And I get a sense of hunger from
her.

51:57.614 --> 52:00.417
- Jasmine Kennedie is a fire
cracker.

52:00.417 --> 52:02.219
Man, that performance.

52:02.219 --> 52:04.188
She was bouncing off the walls.

52:04.188 --> 52:05.656
- And tonight on the runway,

52:05.656 --> 52:07.558
she's 22 years old.

52:07.558 --> 52:08.759
This is a child.

52:08.759 --> 52:10.194
To have a reference like that,

52:10.194 --> 52:12.296
she's done her homework.

52:12.296 --> 52:14.965
- [RuPaul] Maddy Morphosis and
her guitar.

52:14.965 --> 52:16.734
- I appreciate the live guitar
playing.

52:16.734 --> 52:18.602
That was pretty amazing to see.

52:18.602 --> 52:20.838
But the fact that Maddy was
playing the guitar at the end

52:20.838 --> 52:22.673
with her tongue,

52:22.673 --> 52:25.976
and then didn't go to the side
to show us,

52:25.976 --> 52:27.878
it didn't really happen then,
did it?

52:27.878 --> 52:29.680
- And when you have an outfit
that looks like, you know,

52:29.680 --> 52:32.116
Saint John's for H and R Block.

52:32.116 --> 52:35.552
(judges laughing)

52:35.552 --> 52:37.488
But I don't want to chop her
head off.

52:37.488 --> 52:39.490
- She already did.
(RuPaul laughing)

52:39.490 --> 52:41.125
I loved Maddy's runway.

52:41.125 --> 52:44.928
I'm always one to say it's
costumey, but it worked!

52:44.928 --> 52:46.096
- [RuPaul] Angeria.

52:46.096 --> 52:48.365
- Angeria is one of my
favorites, for sure.

52:48.365 --> 52:51.135
There's a spirit there that
I really can connect to.

52:51.135 --> 52:53.604
There's the polish that
feels very exciting.

52:53.604 --> 52:55.406
- Call me Angie, check.

52:55.406 --> 52:57.841
(laughing)

52:57.841 --> 53:00.010
Stunning, check, check, check.

53:00.010 --> 53:02.179
Whatever it was, we were here
for it.

53:02.179 --> 53:03.247
- [RuPaul] Lady Camden.

53:03.247 --> 53:04.615
- Well Lady Camden did what I
think

53:04.615 --> 53:06.984
we wanted Maddy Morphosis to do.

53:06.984 --> 53:09.953
Take this skillset, and then
make it drag.

53:09.953 --> 53:11.422
- Lady Camden probably had the
most

53:11.422 --> 53:13.690
technically difficult
performance of the night.

53:13.690 --> 53:14.992
Not only was she doing ballet,

53:14.992 --> 53:16.960
she was doing it in stilettos,

53:16.960 --> 53:19.663
and that is one of the
most difficult things.

53:19.663 --> 53:20.931
- And I loved the runway.

53:20.931 --> 53:22.132
I thought she looked like, you
know,

53:22.132 --> 53:24.234
nobody else, totally individual.

53:24.234 --> 53:25.469
- I like Lady Camden.

53:25.469 --> 53:28.472
I'm excited to see more from
her.

53:28.472 --> 53:29.540
Daya Betty.

53:29.540 --> 53:31.308
- She looked really cool,

53:31.308 --> 53:33.277
and her energy was good.

53:33.277 --> 53:35.312
But I thought it was really
basic.

53:35.312 --> 53:37.848
- What I was getting was Crystal
Methyd.

53:37.848 --> 53:40.784
So it felt like a Xerox
copy of a Xerox copy.

53:40.784 --> 53:42.686
- But there's all this
room for her to grow,

53:42.686 --> 53:46.223
so she could be that
underdog that comes out

53:46.223 --> 53:47.891
and just shows everybody.

53:47.891 --> 53:49.460
So we'll see where it goes.

53:49.460 --> 53:51.095
- Silence.
(claps twice)

53:51.095 --> 53:52.930
I've made my decision.

53:52.930 --> 53:54.298
Bring back my girls.

53:54.298 --> 53:55.466
(engine revs)
(suspenseful music)

53:55.466 --> 53:57.334
Welcome back, ladies.

53:57.334 --> 53:59.236
I've made some decisions.

53:59.236 --> 54:01.972
(dramatic music)

54:04.108 --> 54:05.109
Lady Camden.

54:06.543 --> 54:07.377
Jorgeous.

54:09.146 --> 54:10.881
You're safe.

54:10.881 --> 54:12.549
- Thank you so much.

54:14.885 --> 54:16.520
- Angeria.

54:16.520 --> 54:17.888
Polish, check.

54:17.888 --> 54:18.889
Glam, check.

54:20.190 --> 54:21.358
Talent, check.

54:22.392 --> 54:23.327
Con-drag-ulations.

54:23.327 --> 54:24.928
You're the winner of
this week's challenge.

54:24.928 --> 54:28.432
(all cheering, clapping)

54:28.432 --> 54:30.868
You've won a cashier's check

54:30.868 --> 54:34.671
of $5000.
(all cheering)

54:34.671 --> 54:35.839
- Oh!

54:35.839 --> 54:40.844
Winner winner, chicken dinner.
(laughing)

54:41.478 --> 54:43.080
- Jasmine Kennedie.

54:44.314 --> 54:45.415
You're safe.

54:45.415 --> 54:46.750
- Thank you.

54:46.750 --> 54:48.018
(suspenseful music)

54:48.018 --> 54:49.586
- Maddy Morphosis.

54:49.586 --> 54:52.723
We were head over heels
for your runway look,

54:52.723 --> 54:55.893
while your guitar made us gently
weep.

54:57.928 --> 54:58.762
DeJa Skye.

55:00.063 --> 55:01.899
We were cheering for you,

55:01.899 --> 55:04.568
but your jokes just didn't land.

55:06.370 --> 55:07.304
Daya Betty,

55:08.272 --> 55:09.873
you're a lovely queen,

55:09.873 --> 55:12.843
but you didn't get this party
started.

55:12.843 --> 55:15.612
(dramatic music)

55:18.315 --> 55:19.650
Maddy Morphosis,

55:20.951 --> 55:21.952
you're safe.

55:25.222 --> 55:26.890
You may join the other girls.

55:26.890 --> 55:27.891
- Thank you.

55:29.226 --> 55:30.327
- DeJa, Daya.

55:31.862 --> 55:33.130
I'm sorry, my dears,

55:33.130 --> 55:35.999
but you are up for elimination.

55:35.999 --> 55:38.936
- My confidence right now is
just shaken.

55:38.936 --> 55:40.070
But when it comes down to it,

55:40.070 --> 55:42.272
I'm gonna fight tooth
and nail to stay here.

55:42.272 --> 55:43.173
Bring it on.

55:43.173 --> 55:46.410
- Two queens stand before me.

55:46.410 --> 55:47.644
Prior to tonight,

55:47.644 --> 55:50.647
you were asked to prepare
a lip sync performance

55:50.647 --> 55:52.983
of "Fallin'" by Alicia Keys.

55:54.051 --> 55:57.621
Ladies, this is your last
chance to impress me,

55:57.621 --> 56:00.557
and save yourself from
elimination.

56:01.525 --> 56:03.427
(suspenseful music)

56:03.427 --> 56:04.394
The time has come

56:04.394 --> 56:05.896
(thunder rumbling)

56:05.896 --> 56:07.464
for you to lip sync

56:08.465 --> 56:09.633
for your life!

56:11.902 --> 56:14.938
(suspenseful music)

56:14.938 --> 56:16.373
- I just walked in the doors,

56:16.373 --> 56:17.641
and now I'm gonna have to lip
sync

56:17.641 --> 56:20.077
to an Alicia Keys song,

56:20.077 --> 56:22.079
in front of Alicia Keys.

56:23.213 --> 56:26.049
- Good luck, and don't fuck it
up.

(dramatic music)

58:38.181 --> 58:40.751
DeJa Skye, shante you stay.

58:40.751 --> 58:43.954
(dramatic music)

58:43.954 --> 58:47.357
Apparently there is a lip
sync assassin among us.

58:47.357 --> 58:48.658
- Thank you so much.

58:48.658 --> 58:51.228
- You may join the other girls.

58:54.097 --> 58:54.998
Daya Betty.

58:55.932 --> 58:58.602
It might not feel like it right
now,

58:58.602 --> 59:00.570
but this is just the beginning

59:00.570 --> 59:02.806
of the rest of your life.

59:02.806 --> 59:04.241
Now, sashay away.

59:06.443 --> 59:08.278
- I might not have gotten
as far as I'd liked,

59:08.278 --> 59:09.813
but I had a great time,

59:09.813 --> 59:12.315
and made some amazing sisters.

59:12.315 --> 59:13.917
And I really appreciate
each and every one of you.

59:13.917 --> 59:15.919
So thank you, thank you.

59:17.387 --> 59:20.457

59:21.458 --> 59:25.896

(all laughing)

59:25.896 --> 59:28.064
(dramatic music)

59:28.064 --> 59:31.968
I'm definitely disappointed in
myself.

59:31.968 --> 59:34.604
I know I have so much
fucking more to offer,

59:34.604 --> 59:37.607
but life is gonna kick you down
99 times,

59:37.607 --> 59:40.310
but you gotta get up 100 and
keep going.

59:40.310 --> 59:43.046

59:44.114 --> 59:45.782
- Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

59:45.782 --> 59:47.317
Enjoy this moment,

59:47.317 --> 59:50.587
because six competitors
will join you next week,

And remember, if you can't love
yourself,

59:55.592 --> 59:57.594
how in the hell are you
gonna love somebody else?

59:57.594 --> 59:59.563
Can I get an amen up in here?

59:59.563 --> 1:00:01.198
- [All] Amen!

1:00:01.198 --> 1:00:03.500

1:00:30.727 --> 1:00:31.728

1:00:31.728 --> 1:00:33.330
- I was enthralled.

1:00:34.297 --> 1:00:36.299

Just when you think you
know how the game is played.

1:00:40.937 --> 1:00:42.572
- Wait.
- What?

1:00:42.572 --> 1:00:43.440
- Oh damn it.

1:00:43.440 --> 1:00:46.109
