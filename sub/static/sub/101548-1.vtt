WEBVTT

00:33.289 --> 00:34.491
Okay.

00:35.593 --> 00:37.929
My name is Mark Gentile.

00:37.962 --> 00:40.798
I was born in Acerenza, Italy.

00:40.831 --> 00:44.335
I never knew my father,
he died before I was born.

00:45.835 --> 00:47.504
I immigrated to
the United States

00:47.537 --> 00:49.272
with my mom in the mid 60's

00:49.305 --> 00:52.777
and, well, education was
very important to my mother.

00:53.777 --> 00:55.413
I worked hard,

00:55.445 --> 00:57.881
and after high school
I went to university,

00:57.914 --> 01:00.918
eventually getting
a degree in law.

01:02.353 --> 01:04.689
I met the love of my life,
Marina,

01:04.721 --> 01:06.957
a Canadian graphic designer.

01:06.990 --> 01:09.894
She convinced me
to move to Toronto.

01:09.927 --> 01:11.462
Big fucking mistake.

01:11.495 --> 01:14.265
Shortly after we were married,

01:14.298 --> 01:16.600
our daughter Laura was born.

01:16.634 --> 01:18.903
Maybe that's too much detail.
I... I just...

01:20.638 --> 01:23.874
I've been with Santius
Automotive for seven years.

01:23.906 --> 01:27.378
Gordon Welsh
was my friend, my mentor.

01:27.411 --> 01:28.846
He moved me into management

01:28.879 --> 01:31.349
and then gave me
the awesome responsibility

01:31.382 --> 01:33.551
of being
chief executive officer.

01:33.584 --> 01:35.653
I proudly hold
that position today.

01:35.686 --> 01:37.822
We are finding ways
to minimize

01:37.855 --> 01:40.825
the environmental damage
caused by our products...

01:40.858 --> 01:42.493
See, you could rephrase that.

01:44.495 --> 01:46.030
Why?!

01:46.063 --> 01:47.897
Well, you don't want to sound
negative about our cars.

01:47.930 --> 01:51.368
Oh. Well, that's a good point.

01:52.736 --> 01:56.474
We continue our
commitment to ensure that

01:56.507 --> 01:59.010
Santius remains affordable

01:59.043 --> 02:00.911
and sustainable.

02:00.944 --> 02:04.781
You know, why don't you just
stick with your achievements?

02:04.814 --> 02:06.683
Why don't you forget
about all the personal stuff.

02:06.716 --> 02:10.288
I know Gordon always used to
encourage that kind of thing,

02:10.320 --> 02:12.590
but, um, you know Barbara,
she... she's...

02:12.622 --> 02:14.758
she rolls her eyes
at that kind of stuff.

02:14.792 --> 02:16.527
No, no, no,
Gordon was right.

02:16.560 --> 02:19.396
I mean, of course
the presentation

02:19.430 --> 02:20.730
needs to be relatable.

02:22.466 --> 02:23.768
You know, forgive me
but Barbara doesn't

02:23.800 --> 02:25.068
quite do "relatable."

02:25.102 --> 02:27.837
But do we care
what Barbara thinks?

02:27.871 --> 02:29.507
What we do need
to care about

02:29.539 --> 02:30.608
is the fact that you
need to get out of here

02:30.640 --> 02:31.709
if you're going to be on time.

02:31.741 --> 02:32.977
All right, we got to go.

02:33.009 --> 02:34.611
- I'm ready.
- All right, let's do it.

02:41.617 --> 02:43.019
- Mark.
- What's up?

02:43.052 --> 02:44.521
Thank God I found you.

02:44.555 --> 02:46.456
I begged them
not to make you do this.

02:46.490 --> 02:47.625
Begged who?

02:47.657 --> 02:49.092
The board. I fought for you,

02:49.126 --> 02:50.995
I really did,
but they insisted.

02:51.027 --> 02:52.396
What's this?

02:54.497 --> 02:56.700
A revised presentation.

02:56.734 --> 02:59.036
The board said there's merit
to your recommendation,

02:59.068 --> 03:02.572
but our shareholders need to know
that we're going to be profitable.

03:02.605 --> 03:04.341
Major green initiatives
are expensive.

03:04.375 --> 03:05.609
In the beginning.

03:05.641 --> 03:07.745
Look, Mark, I tried.
Believe me.

03:07.777 --> 03:10.814
I made that man a promise.

03:10.848 --> 03:12.483
A promise
I don't plan to break.

03:13.817 --> 03:15.885
And one day you'll make good
on that promise.

03:15.919 --> 03:18.889
Just not today.

03:18.921 --> 03:21.091
Ladies and
gentlemen, Mark Gentile.

03:54.957 --> 03:56.493
And so in order to...

03:58.162 --> 04:00.798
ensure sustainability...

04:00.830 --> 04:02.665
for your investments...

04:02.699 --> 04:04.035
Uh...

04:05.169 --> 04:06.471
Uh...

04:09.506 --> 04:10.907
Mark?

04:10.941 --> 04:12.409
In here.

04:17.079 --> 04:19.516
Um, what are you, uh...?

04:19.550 --> 04:20.985
What are you doing
home so early?

04:22.586 --> 04:23.721
Taste.

04:25.521 --> 04:27.057
Oh.

04:27.089 --> 04:28.158
Okay.

04:30.694 --> 04:32.763
Mmm. Very nice.

04:32.795 --> 04:34.432
Thank you.

04:34.464 --> 04:36.733
Um, I can't remember
the last time you cooked.

04:36.766 --> 04:38.502
Or shopped.

04:38.535 --> 04:39.737
Sit.

04:40.838 --> 04:41.906
Okay.

04:47.144 --> 04:48.478
Mm.

04:51.148 --> 04:52.450
Thank you.

04:52.483 --> 04:53.617
Here, let me take that.

05:00.690 --> 05:01.825
Mmm.

05:02.959 --> 05:05.161
Very nice.

05:05.194 --> 05:07.997
Well, if you like that,

05:08.031 --> 05:09.834
take a look at this.

05:12.101 --> 05:13.471
Where are we going?

05:13.504 --> 05:15.706
- Italy.
- Italy! Oh, my gosh!

05:15.738 --> 05:18.141
Mark. Oh, my gosh.

05:18.175 --> 05:19.977
So...

05:20.009 --> 05:23.646
Wow, what's the... what's the...
What's the occasion?

05:23.680 --> 05:25.650
Well, I need to... I need to...

05:26.649 --> 05:28.084
I needed to get outta here.

05:28.117 --> 05:29.786
I mean, not here, here,
you know,

05:29.819 --> 05:31.555
But Santius.

05:33.524 --> 05:36.793
I took a leave.
Uh, permanently.

05:36.826 --> 05:38.094
You... you what?

05:38.127 --> 05:40.497
Uh, no,
but it's... it's, uh...

05:41.732 --> 05:43.234
It's a good thing.

05:43.266 --> 05:45.235
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

05:45.269 --> 05:47.605
No, this is a good thing.
It's a good thing.

05:47.637 --> 05:50.039
And here I thought
all of this was...

05:50.072 --> 05:51.574
What?

05:51.608 --> 05:53.911
For once after us
being distant for so long

05:53.944 --> 05:55.879
you were actually trying
to do something romantic.

05:55.913 --> 05:57.882
I was, I am. I mean...

05:59.550 --> 06:01.185
Wait, we're "distant"?

06:01.218 --> 06:02.218
But you...

06:02.252 --> 06:03.687
You sleep in Laura's room.

06:03.720 --> 06:06.023
Yeah, I've been
working late.

06:06.055 --> 06:08.625
Why did you quit your job?

06:08.658 --> 06:11.060
Wait, does it have something to
do with the presentation today?

06:11.093 --> 06:13.163
I...

06:13.196 --> 06:16.166
Honey, I was...
I was standing there,

06:16.199 --> 06:18.602
you know, and...
In front of all those people

06:18.634 --> 06:22.605
and I'm thinking "How many
good years do I have left?"

06:22.639 --> 06:24.542
And I... I had this epiphany.

06:24.574 --> 06:26.944
Oh, my God,
men and their epiphanies.

06:26.976 --> 06:29.312
You can't just quit your job.

06:29.346 --> 06:31.180
I mean, we haven't
even discussed this,

06:31.213 --> 06:32.916
we haven't talked about anyth...

06:32.949 --> 06:35.552
I mean, when... when were you
thinking of leaving?

06:35.586 --> 06:37.987
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?!

06:38.021 --> 06:40.223
But I'm working tomorrow!

06:40.257 --> 06:41.725
Call in sick.

06:41.757 --> 06:42.959
I can't just call in...

06:42.992 --> 06:44.829
I mean, how long
are we going for?

06:46.228 --> 06:47.997
Oh, my Gosh,
it's an open ended...

06:48.031 --> 06:49.600
It's a first class

06:49.632 --> 06:50.967
open ended ticket.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.735
Have you lost your mind?

07:14.725 --> 07:17.261
Mark, what the fu...?

07:52.862 --> 07:54.264
- Here you go.
- Gratzi.

07:57.519 --> 07:58.604
Good evening.

08:01.737 --> 08:04.908
So are you visiting Italy
for business or pleasure?

08:04.940 --> 08:07.143
Oh, I don't know.

08:08.377 --> 08:10.313
You fly all the way here
from America...

08:10.346 --> 08:11.347
Canada.

08:11.380 --> 08:13.049
Same thing.

08:13.083 --> 08:15.719
You flew all the way here
and you don't know why?

08:15.752 --> 08:18.021
That's how you wind
up on a watch-list, sir.

08:18.055 --> 08:19.088
I have to tick a box.

08:19.122 --> 08:20.891
Where are you staying?

08:20.923 --> 08:23.126
Acerenza.
My grandfather's.

08:23.160 --> 08:24.695
And what are you doing there?

08:24.728 --> 08:26.329
Visiting.

08:26.362 --> 08:28.798
Ah, now we're
getting somewhere.

08:28.831 --> 08:30.867
You are going to visit
your grandfather?

08:30.901 --> 08:32.269
No, he's dead.

08:32.302 --> 08:34.837
And you're just
showing up now?

08:34.870 --> 08:37.040
I'll put "pleasure".

08:37.073 --> 08:38.942
You work it out on your own.

08:40.395 --> 08:41.522
Welcome to Italy.

08:41.745 --> 08:43.014
Arrivederci.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.427
Goodbye. See you tomorrow.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.612
C'mon, Amelia! Jump!

09:45.002 --> 09:46.587
On your marks. Get set. Go!

09:57.139 --> 09:59.558
Hurry, I want to beat
the train!

09:59.600 --> 10:02.311
Bye Marco! See you tomorrow.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.693
Bye, Marco!

10:09.735 --> 10:11.361
Bye, Luca!

10:43.352 --> 10:46.480
Well done, Marco. You just
barely beat it.

10:46.522 --> 10:50.150
Soon, we will have to find a
more worthy opponent for you.

10:51.276 --> 10:52.152
Let's go.

10:54.012 --> 10:54.905
Shut up, you.

10:59.785 --> 11:04.414
Next stop, Acerenza.
Cathedral city. Acerenza.

11:44.663 --> 11:46.290
Excuse me.

11:50.669 --> 11:52.171
Excuse me.

11:52.936 --> 11:56.105
Perdonami.
Um, taxi.

11:56.139 --> 11:57.207
Uh...

11:58.475 --> 11:59.610
Um...

12:01.144 --> 12:02.613
Acerenza.

12:04.141 --> 12:05.559
There are no taxis here.

12:06.048 --> 12:07.283
Oh.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.062
There's a bus.

12:13.590 --> 12:15.225
Ah, grazie.

13:02.105 --> 13:03.507
Buon giorno.

13:05.041 --> 13:06.343
Buon giorno.

13:08.410 --> 13:10.246
Excuse me?

13:10.279 --> 13:12.949
Excuse me. Sir!

13:12.982 --> 13:14.250
That's my bag.

13:14.284 --> 13:16.046
What the hell do I care?
Let me see it!

13:16.088 --> 13:17.714
Take your hands off it.
Give it to me.

13:17.756 --> 13:18.549
Leave it.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.676
My bag.

13:20.717 --> 13:23.846
What do I care? Now it's mine!
Leave the bag alone.

13:24.293 --> 13:26.663
Am I under arrest?

13:26.696 --> 13:28.665
There's a report
of a gang of banditi.

13:28.697 --> 13:30.967
And I... I look like
a bandit to you?

13:32.034 --> 13:33.169
Could be.

13:35.270 --> 13:36.639
ID please.

13:36.673 --> 13:38.375
It's in my bag.

13:38.527 --> 13:39.486
And where is...

13:39.528 --> 13:40.362
this bag?

13:40.409 --> 13:42.245
- It's behind...!
- The bag, the bag, oh!

13:42.489 --> 13:44.199
You're pissing me off.

13:44.480 --> 13:45.548
Ow!

13:45.581 --> 13:46.716
Oh, Bello,

13:46.785 --> 13:48.245
You're under arrest.

13:48.350 --> 13:50.419
you got a lot of nerve
coming back here

13:50.452 --> 13:53.055
like this without
even calling, Marco Gentile.

13:53.089 --> 13:55.559
Huh?

13:55.591 --> 13:57.526
- How long we know each other?
- What?!

13:57.559 --> 14:01.097
"What?" You were this high,
and I was this small.

14:01.130 --> 14:02.432
You looked right through me,

14:02.465 --> 14:04.768
and I knew you
the second I see you.

14:04.801 --> 14:06.403
I was sure it was you.

14:07.336 --> 14:09.232
- Luca?
- Si, Luca.

14:09.266 --> 14:11.773
Oh my God. Luca Morrani?

14:11.807 --> 14:13.744
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh!

14:13.777 --> 14:16.079
I didn't recognize you.

14:16.111 --> 14:17.713
The... The mustache.

14:17.746 --> 14:20.349
Yeah, my mustache looks good.
I grew up a little bit.

14:20.383 --> 14:22.653
Stop it! Don't move! You are
under arrest okay?!

14:24.187 --> 14:26.389
The driver thinks
I'm arresting you.

14:26.423 --> 14:29.225
Word goes around
very fast in this town.

14:29.411 --> 14:31.038
You're under arrest, handsome.
Come on.

14:31.160 --> 14:32.428
- Ow, can you loosen these things?
- Shut up!

14:32.461 --> 14:33.596
- Americano shut up!
- Ow!

14:33.749 --> 14:34.833
Open the door!

14:39.735 --> 14:41.471
You have, uh,
much crime here

14:41.504 --> 14:43.173
on the mean streets
of Acerenza?

14:43.206 --> 14:44.474
Well, Marco.

14:44.506 --> 14:46.776
It's not like it used to be,
you know.

14:46.809 --> 14:49.512
I can't remember
what it used to be.

14:49.546 --> 14:51.548
I haven't been back
in 45 years.

14:53.082 --> 14:54.817
I tell you what happened
two days ago, okay?

14:54.850 --> 14:57.553
Antonio's dog was barking,

14:57.586 --> 15:00.423
and he woke up
Canio Cataldo's dog.

15:00.456 --> 15:02.359
So, he came out of his balcony

15:02.392 --> 15:06.596
and starts screaming
"Hey, your dog, he woke me up.

15:06.629 --> 15:08.197
I'm going to kill him."

15:08.230 --> 15:10.399
And Antonio said,
"You get close to my dog,

15:10.432 --> 15:12.369
I'm going to bomb your house."

15:12.402 --> 15:14.771
He has a gun,
the other one has a bomb.

15:14.803 --> 15:17.274
Lots of weapons.
Yes, it's crazy.

15:17.307 --> 15:18.375
Very dangerous.

15:18.408 --> 15:20.677
- Rough!
- Molto rough.

15:20.710 --> 15:22.412
Rough.

15:22.445 --> 15:24.148
Where you taking me?

15:25.259 --> 15:26.760
Come in.

15:26.802 --> 15:27.594
Don't move.

15:27.636 --> 15:29.179
Stay right there.

15:29.221 --> 15:32.474
Everyone! Your attention,
please.

15:32.516 --> 15:35.769
This is a very important event
for Acerenza.

15:36.687 --> 15:42.776
This very dangerous American
criminal -

15:42.818 --> 15:44.695
Canadian.

15:44.701 --> 15:47.538
Canada, say America,
it's the same shit.

15:47.865 --> 15:52.160
Anyway, this desperate criminal was
born and raised here in Acerenza,

15:52.202 --> 15:55.998
Then against his will, he was
taken to Canada.

15:56.145 --> 15:58.347
No, not against my will.

15:58.380 --> 15:59.615
I make it more dramatic.

15:59.626 --> 16:00.627
Anyway.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.797
I'm going to show you.

16:03.839 --> 16:06.341
Now he's under my custody,
right?

16:07.718 --> 16:09.803
This gentleman's name...

16:10.929 --> 16:13.056
is Marco Gentile.

16:15.267 --> 16:16.643
Oh, you remember him?

16:16.666 --> 16:18.735
Marco Gentile.

16:19.229 --> 16:21.398
Yes, I remember him well.

16:21.440 --> 16:22.482
Even his grandfather.

16:23.706 --> 16:24.740
My nonno?

16:24.774 --> 16:26.308
Marco Gentile.

16:26.341 --> 16:27.644
- Ciao!
- Ciao!

16:29.156 --> 16:30.845
Peppino, off you go.

16:30.879 --> 16:32.849
- Marco.
- Si.

16:32.881 --> 16:35.718
Remember me?
Amelia!

16:35.751 --> 16:36.886
Ame...?

16:36.920 --> 16:38.123
Little Amelia?

16:39.322 --> 16:40.590
Oh, I...

16:40.623 --> 16:42.626
It's nice to see you
all grown up!

16:42.658 --> 16:44.593
How are you?

16:46.196 --> 16:48.091
You turned out beautiful.

16:48.264 --> 16:49.399
Oh, thank you.

17:13.222 --> 17:14.790
- Oh-ah!
- Oh, oh, oh!

17:16.893 --> 17:19.362
Ay, oh. Boom, boom!

17:19.394 --> 17:20.830
Eh.

17:40.383 --> 17:42.885
Laura? Hey.

17:42.919 --> 17:45.855
We haven't
spoken in three years

17:45.887 --> 17:47.356
and you're already
back to nicknames?

17:47.390 --> 17:48.992
Well, well, I...

17:49.025 --> 17:50.694
I'm just glad you called.

17:51.961 --> 17:53.430
Well, I'm not calling
for you, Dad.

17:53.462 --> 17:54.597
I'm calling for mom.

17:54.631 --> 17:56.466
Ho, Marco!

17:56.499 --> 17:57.701
Ho!

17:57.733 --> 17:58.901
Are you at a party?

17:58.934 --> 18:00.236
Uh, yes.

18:00.269 --> 18:03.373
Luca. I ran into him.

18:03.405 --> 18:05.442
He's taken me to Bandini's.

18:05.474 --> 18:07.409
Accordion music.

18:07.442 --> 18:08.845
Who is Luca?

18:08.877 --> 18:10.547
My friend.

18:11.580 --> 18:13.349
Mom is very worried.

18:13.383 --> 18:16.786
No, no, I wanted her to come.
I begged her to come.

18:16.818 --> 18:18.520
Yeah, I heard.

18:18.554 --> 18:19.823
I just don't understand
why you needed to go...

18:19.855 --> 18:21.490
Marco. I remember
when we were kids...

18:21.523 --> 18:22.858
This coming from the guy
who lost his shit

18:22.892 --> 18:24.461
when I needed
to figure things out.

18:24.493 --> 18:25.761
You are unbelievable.

18:25.795 --> 18:27.697
Yeah, right.
While you and yours

18:27.730 --> 18:29.665
were stealing olives from ours.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.335
What?

18:32.367 --> 18:33.970
Look, it's... it's not the same.

18:34.002 --> 18:36.272
Well, you know
it's not about you, Dad.

18:36.306 --> 18:38.441
Laura, you quit school.

18:38.473 --> 18:39.708
And I didn't call
to get into...

18:39.741 --> 18:41.411
Hello?

18:41.443 --> 18:43.546
Hello? Lau?

18:46.481 --> 18:47.716
Dad?

18:47.750 --> 18:49.385
Ah, Marco!

18:49.419 --> 18:52.689
Marco, I deputize him
to drive us back home.

18:52.721 --> 18:54.391
And tonight...

18:55.090 --> 18:56.725
you will stay with me.

18:56.759 --> 18:59.829
No, I can't.
I... I have to stay at mio nonno.

19:02.267 --> 19:06.563
His grandfather's? You
drunkards. Let's go.

19:06.605 --> 19:07.606
What's wrong?

19:10.984 --> 19:14.321
This is the Imposta
Municipale Unica.

19:14.844 --> 19:16.379
Property tax.

19:16.412 --> 19:17.980
No.

19:18.013 --> 19:19.982
This land is ours.
It belongs in the family.

19:20.016 --> 19:23.053
My nonno's estate...

19:23.086 --> 19:25.855
must have been able
to cover the taxes.

19:25.887 --> 19:28.724
Marco, when they make me
put up the sign

19:28.758 --> 19:30.360
I tried to reach you.

19:30.393 --> 19:32.996
No phone, no Facebook,
no address, nothing.

19:35.565 --> 19:38.000
Well, I'm going over.

19:38.034 --> 19:40.637
No, no, no.
As an officer of the law,

19:40.670 --> 19:43.605
I can't allow that.

19:43.638 --> 19:45.808
But as your friend,
I'll give you boost.

19:46.144 --> 19:48.981
Give me your foot. Come here.

19:49.022 --> 19:50.274
Shit, he's heavy.

19:51.847 --> 19:53.549
Deputado, you boost.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.696
Stop calling me Deputy. I'm
your nephew.

20:00.242 --> 20:01.535
Push, push, push.

20:04.894 --> 20:06.430
Okay...

20:08.029 --> 20:09.066
Oh!

20:09.251 --> 20:10.210
God damn.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.369
That's a good lock, huh?

20:12.403 --> 20:13.839
You're totally insane, uncle!

20:14.798 --> 20:15.465
Take this.

20:16.592 --> 20:17.801
Good night.

20:17.843 --> 20:19.011
Good night.

20:19.887 --> 20:20.637
Let's go.

20:47.869 --> 20:49.972
- Honestly, Mark...
- Calm down, Dad.

20:50.006 --> 20:51.708
I am calm!

20:51.740 --> 20:53.643
- Is that why you're yelling?
- Nobody's yelling!

20:53.675 --> 20:55.778
Do you know how proud
your mother and I were

20:55.811 --> 20:57.646
that you even got into McGill?

20:57.680 --> 20:59.548
So she's isn't going
to your alma mater, sweetie.

20:59.582 --> 21:00.984
It's not the end of the world.

21:01.017 --> 21:02.652
What are you,
the counsel for the defense?

21:02.684 --> 21:05.521
Three semesters she's been out
of school. Three!

21:05.555 --> 21:06.990
Dad, people take time off.

21:07.022 --> 21:09.458
Y-yes, they do.
Of course they do,

21:09.491 --> 21:11.094
and hopefully they have
the courtesy

21:11.126 --> 21:14.864
of telling their parents
they dropped out!

21:14.896 --> 21:16.665
Over a year
you've been out of school,

21:16.699 --> 21:17.967
not living at home,

21:18.000 --> 21:19.669
- we don't know where!
- Shh, shh.

21:19.701 --> 21:23.071
I mean, I'll be sending
checks for books, for tuition.

21:23.105 --> 21:26.209
You say nothing!
Are you on drugs?

21:26.241 --> 21:27.876
Do I look like
I'm on drugs?

21:27.910 --> 21:30.513
How would I know?

21:30.546 --> 21:33.650
Where are you going?
Laura! Laura!

21:33.682 --> 21:34.850
Oh, my God.

21:36.519 --> 21:37.753
I wasn't through.

21:37.787 --> 21:39.087
Yeah, well, yell louder.

21:39.121 --> 21:40.490
That's obviously
getting through to her.

21:40.522 --> 21:41.890
What else was I supposed to do?

21:41.923 --> 21:43.793
I don't know, Mark.
Anything but that.

21:46.473 --> 21:47.830
Who's shooting?

21:47.864 --> 21:48.965
- Ho!
- Ah!

23:17.086 --> 23:18.721
Nonno!

23:19.107 --> 23:23.320
Come! Let's go pick some of
Morrani's olives.

23:24.026 --> 23:27.663
Why are you throwing stones?
This is your room.

23:27.697 --> 23:30.536
It's more fun down here.

23:32.162 --> 23:33.038
Come on!

23:33.269 --> 23:34.738
Okay.

23:40.609 --> 23:42.846
What if they catch us?

23:43.465 --> 23:46.844
We're not stealing!
It's a trade.

23:46.885 --> 23:48.929
They take our figs, we take
their olives.

23:48.971 --> 23:51.139
Everyone's happy.

23:52.887 --> 23:55.791
Nonno, if it's not stealing

23:55.825 --> 23:57.961
why are we doing it at night?

23:58.021 --> 24:01.149
Because dreams are more
beautiful in the moonlight.

24:05.362 --> 24:08.136
The best ones are up high.

24:08.170 --> 24:09.672
No, no, no.

24:09.704 --> 24:12.641
It won't hold me.
I-I-I'm an old man.

24:12.911 --> 24:14.705
Of course it will hold you.

24:16.415 --> 24:18.208
You're just a boy.

24:19.921 --> 24:22.171
I don't see the point in all
this subterfuge.

24:22.212 --> 24:25.132
Subterfuge. I don't know the
meaning of that word.

24:25.174 --> 24:29.052
But we have an unspoken
agreement with Morrani.

24:29.094 --> 24:35.058
If we took their olives in daylight,
then we'd have to talk about it.

24:35.100 --> 24:37.186
Then it wouldn't be unspoken.

24:37.227 --> 24:39.688
But Nonno, it just doesn't
make sense.

24:39.730 --> 24:43.150
Bambino, look at the moon.

24:43.192 --> 24:45.068
Smell the air.

24:45.110 --> 24:48.864
Listen to the wind through the trees.

24:48.906 --> 24:50.908
Why would you give up
all of this?

24:57.080 --> 24:59.060
Why give all this up just to
make things make sense?

24:59.094 --> 25:00.155
Aye!

25:02.377 --> 25:04.046
Damn you.

25:08.884 --> 25:10.636
You disgrace. I'll cut you!

25:10.677 --> 25:11.720
Cut you!

25:19.269 --> 25:20.646
But you, you're beautiful.

25:21.647 --> 25:24.233
You're even more beautiful.

25:26.235 --> 25:29.196
I'll give you a kiss.

25:29.238 --> 25:30.656
Will you kiss me back?

25:32.533 --> 25:34.243
I'm not kissing you.

25:41.963 --> 25:43.098
Hello!

25:43.168 --> 25:44.628
Enzo!

25:44.670 --> 25:47.256
I told you a thousand times to
stay away from the house.

25:47.297 --> 25:48.632
Get out of here.

25:49.038 --> 25:50.373
Uh, no, uh...

25:50.405 --> 25:51.875
Eh?

25:53.262 --> 25:54.721
You're not Enzo.

25:54.876 --> 25:56.846
Mark.

25:56.878 --> 25:58.147
Gentile.

25:58.892 --> 26:00.477
The lawyer Gentile?

26:01.436 --> 26:06.316
I used to help Canio Gentile
when he lived here.

26:06.358 --> 26:07.776
I used to call him
Uncle Canio.

26:08.861 --> 26:11.613
He taught me how to do everything
here. This is all him.

26:11.655 --> 26:12.573
He was great.

26:13.028 --> 26:14.329
Um...

26:16.365 --> 26:18.201
What are you doing here now?

26:19.204 --> 26:22.249
The town pays me to keep the
place nice.

26:22.291 --> 26:25.460
But I don't keep it too nice,
or else they'll sell it.

26:26.174 --> 26:28.411
Who's, um...

26:28.443 --> 26:29.778
Enzo?

26:30.007 --> 26:31.300
Enzo.

26:31.341 --> 26:33.177
Never mind Enzo.

26:35.384 --> 26:36.786
Marcello.

26:36.818 --> 26:38.788
Hey, Marcello.
Mark. Marco.

26:38.820 --> 26:39.923
Ah, Marco.

26:45.939 --> 26:47.816
So what do you think?

26:47.858 --> 26:49.860
I do this all by myself.

26:49.964 --> 26:51.800
Si. Very nice.

26:52.029 --> 26:53.822
I keep the vines healthy.

26:53.864 --> 26:55.240
Barely.

26:57.576 --> 27:02.164
I talk to the vines whether
they are good or bad.

27:02.206 --> 27:06.668
Otherwise, they feel abandoned
and they forget their purpose.

27:06.710 --> 27:07.503
Understand?

27:07.516 --> 27:11.487
Um, are there...

27:11.519 --> 27:15.357
many wine makers left?

27:15.391 --> 27:16.526
No, no, no.

27:18.514 --> 27:21.475
The vineyards were abandoned
long ago.

27:21.517 --> 27:23.852
Acerenza's youth no longer
live here.

27:23.894 --> 27:25.854
Here, there's only one man who
makes wine.

27:25.968 --> 27:27.370
Who?

27:28.273 --> 27:29.608
Me!

27:29.650 --> 27:31.485
I make a few cases each year.

27:31.527 --> 27:34.446
Always in the memory of your
grandfather.

27:36.323 --> 27:38.200
But I also like to drink.

27:39.117 --> 27:40.077
A little.

27:41.245 --> 27:42.663
Are you hungry?

27:50.796 --> 27:51.755
Enjoy your meal.

27:52.528 --> 27:54.262
Grazie.

27:54.296 --> 27:55.331
Buona.

27:55.364 --> 27:57.066
Ah, si.

27:58.345 --> 28:00.097
Have you gone to see your
grandfather?

28:00.201 --> 28:04.006
Um, no, not yet.

28:04.038 --> 28:05.407
When, uh...

28:06.541 --> 28:09.311
mio nonno morte

28:10.578 --> 28:12.214
I was fresh out of college.

28:12.248 --> 28:15.617
Married, mi amore,

28:15.651 --> 28:17.452
mia bambina...

28:18.554 --> 28:20.123
responsibility.

28:21.490 --> 28:22.892
You know how it is.

28:24.226 --> 28:25.461
Go.

28:26.164 --> 28:27.875
Go see him.

28:30.294 --> 28:31.587
Good morning.

28:33.368 --> 28:35.605
Okay, who is that guy?

28:35.799 --> 28:37.509
Enzo.

28:37.551 --> 28:39.970
He's particular. Special.

28:40.012 --> 28:42.055
He lives here. Not in the
house. Outside.

28:42.097 --> 28:43.432
He refuses to leave.

28:43.473 --> 28:44.349
He doesn't want to.

28:44.445 --> 28:45.914
Wait, squatting?

28:45.948 --> 28:47.450
He's squatting here?

28:47.482 --> 28:49.018
Si, si.

28:49.271 --> 28:52.316
He lives in a shack at the
back of the property.

28:52.357 --> 28:55.110
I tried to get him evicted,
but he doesn't want to.

28:55.152 --> 28:56.361
He says he has rights.

28:56.403 --> 28:57.696
It's the law.

28:57.738 --> 29:00.949
I can't do anything about it.
My hands are tied.

29:11.640 --> 29:13.542
Hello.

29:13.575 --> 29:15.443
Are you coming?

29:15.477 --> 29:16.646
Oh!

29:31.480 --> 29:33.148
When supper was ended he took
the cup.

29:33.190 --> 29:35.067
Again he gave you thanks and
praise.

29:35.108 --> 29:37.569
He gave the cup to his
disciples and said,

29:37.611 --> 29:39.947
take this, all of you, and
drink from it.

29:39.988 --> 29:42.783
This is the cup of my blood,

29:42.824 --> 29:44.785
the blood of the new and
everlasting covenant.

29:44.826 --> 29:49.581
It will be shed for you, so
that sins may be forgiven.

29:49.623 --> 29:51.792
Do this in memory of me.

29:51.834 --> 29:53.293
Blood of Christ.

30:04.012 --> 30:05.764
Blessed are you, Lord,

30:05.806 --> 30:07.516
God of all creation.

30:07.558 --> 30:10.561
Through your goodness we have
this wine.

30:10.602 --> 30:12.980
To offer fruit of the vine and
work of human hands.

30:13.021 --> 30:18.443
So it will become our drink
of salvation.

30:18.485 --> 30:20.821
Blessed be the Lord over the
centuries.

30:20.863 --> 30:23.490
Receive us humble and
repentant, O Lord.

30:23.532 --> 30:27.619
May our sacrifice, which is fulfilled
before you, be acceptable to you.

30:27.661 --> 30:30.414
Wash me, Lord, clean
from all guilt.

30:30.455 --> 30:33.000
Purify me from all sin.

30:33.041 --> 30:37.254
Pray, brethren, that our
sacrifice, may be acceptable

30:37.296 --> 30:39.089
to God, the Almighty Father.

30:39.131 --> 30:43.677
Pray, brethren, that our
family gathered in the name of

30:43.719 --> 30:45.554
Christ can offer sacrifice to
God, the Almighty Father.

30:48.804 --> 30:51.374
Mark, thanks for coming.

31:03.451 --> 31:05.520
H-how are you feeling, Gordo?

31:07.088 --> 31:11.124
That's for Doctor Applebaum
here to determine.

31:12.394 --> 31:14.396
Barbara, thanks for coming.

31:14.430 --> 31:16.365
Mark, you know Barbara.

31:19.434 --> 31:21.703
So, how are
the grandkids, Gordon?

31:21.737 --> 31:24.340
Mark, listen,

31:24.373 --> 31:26.342
as far as
soulless attorneys go,

31:26.375 --> 31:28.076
you're one of the best.

31:28.109 --> 31:30.178
Not just legally speaking.

31:30.211 --> 31:32.448
You've got a mind for business.

31:32.480 --> 31:35.151
Right... right into it, huh?

31:35.183 --> 31:38.620
I'm sorry.
How are Marina and Laura?

31:38.653 --> 31:40.423
They're not talking to me.

31:40.455 --> 31:41.756
Excellent.

31:41.789 --> 31:43.558
So where were we?

31:43.592 --> 31:47.263
You were buttering Mark up
by disparaging his profession.

31:48.864 --> 31:50.799
You're damn straight I was.

31:57.772 --> 31:58.807
Thank you.

32:03.778 --> 32:05.146
You okay?

32:05.180 --> 32:06.516
Mark.

32:07.715 --> 32:09.551
When I decided to make cars,

32:09.585 --> 32:12.587
everybody told me I was nuts.

32:12.621 --> 32:14.690
They said the market competition

32:14.722 --> 32:17.092
was too stiff to make a dent.

32:18.124 --> 32:18.560
So you know what I did?

32:18.594 --> 32:20.528
Ignored them
and did it anyway.

32:20.561 --> 32:21.830
Bingo.

32:23.332 --> 32:26.502
So my question to you,
Mark, is this.

32:28.537 --> 32:30.673
How would you like
to run this outfit?

32:32.340 --> 32:33.808
What?

32:33.842 --> 32:37.246
Whether it's in a courtroom
or in a boardroom,

32:37.278 --> 32:39.381
you never cut a corner,

32:39.413 --> 32:41.750
break your word,

32:41.782 --> 32:44.186
or take the easy way out.

32:45.554 --> 32:48.357
You'll do the right thing
once I'm gone.

32:48.390 --> 32:50.426
But don't worry,

32:50.459 --> 32:52.461
you'll be working alongside me

32:52.493 --> 32:54.629
until you're ready
to take over.

32:54.663 --> 32:56.464
The board will
make sure of this.

33:00.981 --> 33:02.858
The body of Christ?

33:04.902 --> 33:06.862
The body of Christ.

33:09.377 --> 33:10.445
Uh...

33:13.781 --> 33:14.884
Amen.

33:19.416 --> 33:22.586
In the name of the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

33:22.628 --> 33:25.506
I welcome you in the name of
God. Talk to me, son.

33:25.547 --> 33:27.883
Forgive me, father...

33:29.092 --> 33:30.511
You can speak English.

33:30.531 --> 33:31.900
Thank you.

33:31.933 --> 33:34.403
It's been, uh...

33:35.804 --> 33:38.774
a long time since my,
uh, last confession.

33:38.807 --> 33:40.409
I don't know where to start,

33:40.442 --> 33:43.811
I... made a promise

33:43.845 --> 33:46.348
to this dying man
and I betrayed that trust.

33:46.568 --> 33:48.195
Betrayed in what way?

33:48.482 --> 33:50.286
Uh...

33:50.318 --> 33:52.320
Yeah, by trade I'm a lawyer.

33:52.354 --> 33:54.576
Maybe you are beyond
salvation, my son.

33:54.589 --> 33:55.590
What?

33:55.624 --> 33:56.954
Forgive me.

33:56.995 --> 33:57.913
It's a joke.

33:59.327 --> 34:01.596
Look, I'm trying
to be serious here, Father.

34:01.630 --> 34:03.799
I betrayed my own ethics.

34:03.919 --> 34:05.087
How is that a sin?

34:05.334 --> 34:06.902
I gave him my word.

34:06.934 --> 34:09.270
The man was dying,

34:09.304 --> 34:11.307
and I promised him,

34:12.306 --> 34:13.475
and I lied.

34:13.509 --> 34:14.554
So then,

34:14.596 --> 34:16.223
rectify what you did.

34:16.445 --> 34:18.581
Oh, I can't, I...

34:18.614 --> 34:20.282
I quit in protest.

34:20.351 --> 34:21.603
You ran away?

34:22.563 --> 34:25.148
Cowardice is not a virtue.

34:25.190 --> 34:26.817
But it's not a mortal sin.

34:27.289 --> 34:28.858
I don't know what to do.

34:29.319 --> 34:31.237
Get over yourself.

34:31.280 --> 34:35.074
The real sin here is your
obsession about your mistake.

34:35.117 --> 34:38.453
The answer lies in service to
something other than yourself.

34:38.766 --> 34:39.835
To God?

34:40.038 --> 34:40.789
God

34:40.831 --> 34:42.416
doesn't need a lawyer.

34:42.503 --> 34:43.639
To who then?

34:43.750 --> 34:45.377
It's for you to decide.

34:45.418 --> 34:46.795
God bless you.

34:46.942 --> 34:49.344
What, no Hail Marys?

35:46.400 --> 35:48.403
- Buon giorno.
- Buon giorno.

36:27.976 --> 36:29.577
I'm sorry, Nonno.

36:29.610 --> 36:31.346
I'm sorry I...

36:32.146 --> 36:34.016
I took so long.

36:34.048 --> 36:35.851
I wasn't there for you.

36:37.052 --> 36:39.622
Jesus,
I sound like an asshole.

36:41.910 --> 36:43.078
Yes, you do.

36:44.037 --> 36:45.998
Didn't we already talk last
night?

36:46.961 --> 36:49.097
I needed to apologize.

36:49.168 --> 36:50.544
Why are you worrying?

36:50.586 --> 36:57.009
You made your choices and now
you live with remorse.

36:58.051 --> 37:02.431
Apologizing to the dead now
doesn't change anything.

37:02.472 --> 37:06.935
Maybe now you can make better
choices.

37:06.977 --> 37:11.190
Marco, this land is part of
you.

37:12.721 --> 37:14.856
Italy?

37:14.889 --> 37:15.990
Ha!

37:16.486 --> 37:18.447
This land.

37:19.948 --> 37:21.575
My land.

37:24.286 --> 37:25.871
Cheers.

37:45.454 --> 37:46.555
Done?

37:47.588 --> 37:48.757
Done.

37:52.494 --> 37:54.063
Marcello!

37:54.149 --> 37:55.526
Marcello!

37:56.527 --> 37:58.612
Let's make a little wine.

38:01.532 --> 38:02.491
Laywer, what's up?

38:02.570 --> 38:03.773
We're open.

38:05.035 --> 38:06.203
What do you mean, "make some
wine"?

38:07.371 --> 38:08.789
You want to grow here?

38:08.830 --> 38:09.957
To sell grapes?

38:09.998 --> 38:11.549
- Impossible.
- Why?

38:11.583 --> 38:12.709
There's only two of us.

38:12.751 --> 38:13.669
Two men.

38:13.710 --> 38:15.216
We need other people.

38:15.250 --> 38:17.018
Ah, Acerenza has people.

38:17.172 --> 38:19.091
Acerenza is full of old
people.

38:19.132 --> 38:21.768
- The youth have all gone.
- We'll get 'em.

38:21.802 --> 38:23.387
No, no, not a good idea.

38:23.428 --> 38:27.057
You don't even own this land!
You're a squatter. Like Enzo!

38:27.061 --> 38:29.130
No. I own it.

38:29.164 --> 38:30.966
I paid off the back taxes.

38:30.998 --> 38:34.969
This is good news.
Oh! Nice going, Serpico.

38:35.274 --> 38:37.234
No, this is not a good idea.

38:39.987 --> 38:41.071
Good morning.

38:41.113 --> 38:42.072
Good morning.

38:42.114 --> 38:43.156
Good morning Amelia.

38:44.199 --> 38:45.742
Can I make an announcement?

38:45.784 --> 38:46.577
Go ahead.

38:48.495 --> 38:52.124
Are you preparing to run
for mayor?

38:52.165 --> 38:54.001
Nice girl.

38:54.042 --> 38:57.087
Tell them I'm making pastries
with ricotta.

38:57.129 --> 38:58.759
If they pay for one, I'll give
them two.

39:00.340 --> 39:02.009
Attention.

39:02.050 --> 39:03.302
Attention.

39:05.360 --> 39:06.266
Well then...

39:07.238 --> 39:08.557
Silence!

39:08.599 --> 39:11.059
Marco Gentile's got something
to announce.

39:11.101 --> 39:12.019
Thank you.

39:13.562 --> 39:18.817
I'm thinking of reopening my
grandfather's vineyard.

39:18.859 --> 39:22.196
You're thinking of? Or are you
actually going to?

39:22.237 --> 39:25.324
I'm thinking of going to the
moon.

39:25.365 --> 39:27.075
Okay, have a good trip!

39:27.722 --> 39:28.824
How many?

39:28.858 --> 39:30.787
It depends.
It depends on them.

39:35.375 --> 39:36.043
Why?

39:39.379 --> 39:41.131
Marco, what do you expect?

39:41.173 --> 39:42.591
We've all been here for
many years.

39:42.633 --> 39:47.221
We're hard workers, but full
time jobs are difficult to find.

39:49.515 --> 39:51.058
This could be that.

39:52.313 --> 39:53.781
You're dreaming.

39:54.849 --> 39:57.286
Sometimes...

39:57.318 --> 39:59.788
dreams come true.

40:01.318 --> 40:03.529
Can I give you some advice?

40:03.570 --> 40:06.657
If you build this vineyard in
honor of your grandfather,

40:06.698 --> 40:09.159
it can become
everyone's dream.

40:09.164 --> 40:10.632
Not only for you.

40:10.664 --> 40:12.668
but for everybody.

40:16.792 --> 40:19.294
Are you crazy? There's no
jobs here.

40:19.336 --> 40:20.963
What jobs?

40:21.004 --> 40:21.547
The vineyard.

40:21.588 --> 40:23.215
Who sent you here?

40:23.257 --> 40:24.675
He said he's opening the vineyard.

40:24.716 --> 40:25.676
Who told you that?

40:25.813 --> 40:27.815
He looks angry,
Marcello. Si?

40:27.849 --> 40:28.951
Si.

40:29.179 --> 40:29.721
The foreigner.

40:29.763 --> 40:31.390
What foreigner?

40:31.431 --> 40:33.684
Him!

40:33.725 --> 40:34.643
Lawyer!

40:34.685 --> 40:36.270
I already told you!

40:36.311 --> 40:41.030
To reopen the winery and harvest
everything is not a good idea.

40:41.064 --> 40:42.264
Why?

40:42.297 --> 40:45.199
My grandfather,
he did it.

40:45.233 --> 40:47.336
What's the harm in trying?

40:47.370 --> 40:50.200
Let your grandfather's soul
rest in peace.

40:50.242 --> 40:52.202
He would sell wine off the
back of a donkey!

40:52.239 --> 40:54.642
He says your grandfather
used to sell Vino with...

40:54.675 --> 40:57.011
How do you call the animal...
'Hee-haw, hee-haw'?

40:57.045 --> 40:58.280
- How do you say it?
- So, it's...

40:58.313 --> 41:00.048
So we'll get a donkey!

41:00.085 --> 41:00.919
Okay, lawyer.

41:00.961 --> 41:02.254
You want to go broke?

41:02.296 --> 41:02.880
It's up to you.

41:02.921 --> 41:03.797
Me? I'm going home.

41:03.985 --> 41:06.021
- Mm. He's going home.
- Go!

41:06.054 --> 41:08.123
- Wait, I need him.
- Yeah, just call him.

41:08.155 --> 41:09.625
- No, no, hey! Marcello!
- Call him, call him!

41:09.657 --> 41:11.360
I don't know how
to make wine!

41:11.393 --> 41:12.894
Marcello!

41:13.265 --> 41:14.224
Lawyer.

41:14.266 --> 41:16.768
You want to make a case or two
of wine?

41:16.810 --> 41:18.687
It's my pleasure to help you.

41:18.729 --> 41:20.981
But this idea...

41:21.023 --> 41:23.942
This gives everyone false
hope!

41:23.984 --> 41:25.485
I want no part of it.

41:25.519 --> 41:28.711
I better not translate,
I mean, he's mad, okay?

41:30.711 --> 41:32.981
Does anyone know
how to make wine here?

41:33.015 --> 41:34.453
Nobody.

41:34.487 --> 41:35.416
Nobody.

41:35.449 --> 41:36.884
Okay, so we Google it.

41:36.918 --> 41:38.086
We Goog... Um.

41:38.373 --> 41:39.666
We'll search for it with
Google.

41:39.788 --> 41:41.123
Okay, let's go.

41:56.737 --> 41:58.306
Marina Gentile.

41:58.338 --> 42:00.307
Mrs. Gentile,
Bryan Jessup here.

42:00.340 --> 42:02.978
Oh, hi, Bryan.
How are you?

42:03.010 --> 42:04.813
Oh, fine, fine.

42:04.846 --> 42:06.213
I was just sorry to see
that your husband

42:06.246 --> 42:07.915
closed your
retirement account.

42:07.949 --> 42:09.684
I tried calling him,

42:09.717 --> 42:11.786
- but he didn't answer...
- I'm sorry. He did what?

42:18.358 --> 42:21.328
Here's 70, 80, 90...

42:21.362 --> 42:24.166
110, 150...

42:25.333 --> 42:27.001
That's it.

43:11.780 --> 43:15.182
Okay, buona sera.

43:15.215 --> 43:17.085
- Tomorrow?
- Yes, si.

43:17.117 --> 43:19.121
Same time, same place.

43:19.153 --> 43:21.123
- Tomorrow. Thank you.
- Thank you.

43:22.157 --> 43:23.425
Thank you.

43:23.458 --> 43:27.162
Oh, piacere.
He forgot his... Okay.

43:40.307 --> 43:41.543
Oh!

43:41.576 --> 43:43.211
Michelino!

43:44.112 --> 43:45.447
Ciao.

43:54.422 --> 43:56.291
- Hey!
- Oh, hey, honey,

43:56.324 --> 43:57.925
I-I'm so sorry, I...

43:57.958 --> 44:00.060
- Is he not back yet?
- No! Nothing!

44:00.094 --> 44:01.963
- What is he doing?
- I don't know!

44:01.996 --> 44:03.164
I think the
medical term for it is

44:03.197 --> 44:04.432
"losing his fucking marbles."

44:05.465 --> 44:07.234
Let's look into flights.

44:07.268 --> 44:10.038
Oh, sweetheart.
Oh, you don't have to do this.

44:10.070 --> 44:11.539
Mom, don't worry about it.

44:11.572 --> 44:13.407
This job is gonna
be here when I get back.

44:13.440 --> 44:15.442
- Trust me.
- I know, but... but,

44:15.476 --> 44:16.978
honestly you don't
have to come with me.

44:17.010 --> 44:18.480
He is not your problem.

44:18.512 --> 44:20.548
Mom, you are not going alone.

44:44.271 --> 44:46.540
Look at him...
Feeling the soil

44:46.574 --> 44:49.211
like he knows
what he's doing.

44:49.244 --> 44:50.612
"I smell nutrients.

44:50.644 --> 44:54.416
Look at me!
I'm the dirt whisperer."

44:54.449 --> 44:56.550
Who does
this desk jockey think he is?

44:56.583 --> 44:59.420
He's a corporate stooge.
A company man.

45:00.954 --> 45:02.590
He thinks he can make wine!

45:02.623 --> 45:04.558
You don't know
what you're talking about.

45:04.592 --> 45:06.561
I was born here.

45:06.594 --> 45:09.130
You were a kid when you
left, Marco Gentile.

45:09.163 --> 45:11.498
You didn't even come back
for Nonno's funeral!

45:11.532 --> 45:13.101
And now you're bald!

45:13.134 --> 45:14.635
You want to reopen this place?

45:14.668 --> 45:15.971
Take my advice.

45:16.003 --> 45:18.038
Forget it! Go home.

45:18.072 --> 45:20.242
We don't need
guys like you around here!

45:20.275 --> 45:21.876
Guys like me?

45:21.909 --> 45:23.010
Yeah, you'll screw up this place

45:23.043 --> 45:24.278
like you screwed up your life!

45:24.311 --> 45:25.947
My life is good.

45:25.980 --> 45:29.317
Really? How's Marina? Or Laura?

45:29.349 --> 45:30.985
Do you ever
talk to your daughter?

45:31.018 --> 45:32.286
Will you...?

45:32.320 --> 45:34.189
You're crazy!

45:34.222 --> 45:36.024
Says the guy
who's talking to a plant.

45:36.056 --> 45:37.157
Shut up!

45:38.626 --> 45:39.928
Shut up!

45:57.049 --> 45:58.425
Good evening, miss.

45:59.981 --> 46:01.116
Marcello.

46:01.428 --> 46:04.264
Over there.

46:04.306 --> 46:05.641
Thank you very much.

46:05.682 --> 46:06.934
Over there.

46:22.036 --> 46:24.273
Marcello!

46:28.710 --> 46:31.413
Marcello!

46:38.552 --> 46:39.688
Que?

46:42.023 --> 46:43.959
The vines are yelling at me.

46:47.724 --> 46:48.976
What did they say to you?

46:50.130 --> 46:52.300
They were generally nasty.

46:54.648 --> 46:56.149
If the vines talk back,

46:56.191 --> 46:57.609
it's you talking.

46:58.902 --> 47:01.446
Maybe you should listen?

47:01.476 --> 47:03.979
No, no, no.
I got to do this.

47:04.012 --> 47:06.047
I... I don't even know why.

47:06.079 --> 47:08.115
But it could be good.

47:08.148 --> 47:10.652
For the people, the town,

47:10.684 --> 47:12.253
maybe even me.

47:12.541 --> 47:14.293
It's only one vineyard.

47:14.334 --> 47:15.627
Only one vine.

47:15.669 --> 47:16.920
You understand?

47:16.962 --> 47:18.338
It's not the saviour of
Acerenza.

47:18.380 --> 47:19.923
And neither are you!

47:19.965 --> 47:20.507
Understand?

47:22.885 --> 47:24.428
I'll take you home in the
morning

47:24.469 --> 47:27.139
and see what kind of mess
you've made of my vineyard.

47:35.175 --> 47:36.711
You're gonna help me?

47:38.317 --> 47:41.737
If you want to go crazy,
that's your business.

47:41.778 --> 47:43.739
You want to make wine?

47:43.780 --> 47:44.698
That's mine.

47:46.353 --> 47:49.090
Si, I help you.

48:05.606 --> 48:09.111
So we need an irrigation line?

48:09.145 --> 48:10.974
Do you know what type of
grapes these are?

48:12.413 --> 48:14.315
Don't be a wise ass.

48:17.184 --> 48:18.387
They're red.

48:19.566 --> 48:23.278
In this region, only one grape
grows - Aglianco.

48:23.320 --> 48:24.279
Aglianico.

48:24.321 --> 48:26.240
Aglianico can not be
irrigated.

48:26.360 --> 48:27.248
Okay.

48:27.282 --> 48:28.450
No water.

48:28.492 --> 48:30.118
Only the rain. Natural water.

48:30.565 --> 48:32.467
Si. From God, okay.

48:32.788 --> 48:34.414
To make irrigation for
one plant,

48:34.456 --> 48:36.625
you need permission.

48:36.667 --> 48:38.669
Permission from the Aglianco
jury.

48:38.773 --> 48:40.842
Okay, no permission.

48:40.875 --> 48:42.210
Water from God.

48:42.244 --> 48:44.216
Marco, there are no shortcuts.

48:44.258 --> 48:47.719
With Aglianco del Vulture
there are a lot of rules.

48:47.761 --> 48:50.264
You need patience...

48:50.305 --> 48:51.181
...and love.

48:51.452 --> 48:53.155
And money.

48:53.600 --> 48:57.104
The finest flavours of
Basilicata in one bottle.

48:57.145 --> 49:02.860
When you drink it, it's full-bodied,
very red. It cleanses your mouth.

49:02.901 --> 49:05.779
We harvest in the fall.

49:05.821 --> 49:07.614
Now let's take a look at the
barrels.

49:13.340 --> 49:14.708
No, no, no, no.

49:14.788 --> 49:16.874
It's not enough.

49:16.915 --> 49:19.293
We're going to need more.

49:19.334 --> 49:21.545
The best is French oak.

49:22.650 --> 49:24.619
Well, what's that
going to cost?

49:24.652 --> 49:27.789
I just paid 20 years
in back-taxes.

49:28.093 --> 49:29.386
Don't worry.

49:29.428 --> 49:33.390
I know a man who can get us
many barrels.

49:41.732 --> 49:44.776
If it rains, it'll be
no good.

49:44.818 --> 49:45.611
Lawyer.

49:46.612 --> 49:47.613
It's time.

49:56.288 --> 49:57.623
I...

49:57.664 --> 49:59.708
twelve people...

49:59.750 --> 50:01.585
To work in the fields.

50:01.588 --> 50:02.657
Yeah.

50:03.003 --> 50:05.088
We need twelve people

50:05.130 --> 50:06.632
to work in the fields.

50:08.258 --> 50:09.551
Is lunch included?

50:09.963 --> 50:12.701
He want to know
if lunch included.

50:13.934 --> 50:15.603
- For 20 workers?
- Yes!

50:16.637 --> 50:17.672
Um...

50:18.672 --> 50:19.773
we'll see.

50:25.246 --> 50:26.314
Bene!

50:29.583 --> 50:31.286
Signora, bene.

50:31.782 --> 50:33.283
Okay, let's go to work.

50:40.594 --> 50:41.695
Prego.

50:41.728 --> 50:44.264
- Hello.
- Salve. Posso.

50:44.297 --> 50:47.301
- Hello.
- Hi.

50:47.335 --> 50:50.271
Are you traveling to Italy
for business or for pleasure?

50:50.304 --> 50:51.739
Um...

50:51.771 --> 50:54.976
Don't tell me.
You're going to Acerenza?

50:55.009 --> 50:56.677
How did you know that?

50:56.682 --> 50:57.850
Just a hunch.

51:04.356 --> 51:05.232
Hold on.

51:08.322 --> 51:09.423
Buon giorno.

51:12.739 --> 51:15.075
Has the day arrived?

51:15.117 --> 51:16.702
What day?

51:16.743 --> 51:18.620
The day of my eviction.

51:18.662 --> 51:22.032
But I'm not going without a
fight.

51:22.066 --> 51:23.876
- I'm not...
- Hold on a minute.

51:23.917 --> 51:26.086
Are you even the legal owner
of this property?

51:26.128 --> 51:28.547
Enzo was here before you!

51:28.643 --> 51:30.510
Uh, I'm not
going to evict you.

51:30.543 --> 51:32.913
Ah. Come in.

51:36.516 --> 51:37.585
Grazie.

51:37.723 --> 51:38.432
Sorry.

51:39.019 --> 51:40.922
Uh, you, uh...

51:40.954 --> 51:43.958
take the nice... chair.

51:46.393 --> 51:47.461
Grazie.

51:47.983 --> 51:49.151
You're welcome.

51:50.898 --> 51:52.934
Y-you have...

51:52.967 --> 51:56.371
connections for, uh,
the barrels?

51:56.403 --> 51:57.572
The Vino. The Vino.

51:57.605 --> 52:00.942
Ah, si, si.
Fabbrica, uh...

52:01.876 --> 52:03.278
Factory!

52:03.311 --> 52:04.846
- Si.
- Si.

52:04.878 --> 52:08.717
I need you to help me
purchase many barrels.

52:11.786 --> 52:13.989
No, no.

52:14.954 --> 52:16.723
Enzo retire.

52:16.757 --> 52:18.992
What are you talking about?
You're mid-forties?

52:19.025 --> 52:22.562
I take a "early retirement."

52:22.596 --> 52:24.932
Okay? I can not help you.

52:28.469 --> 52:30.038
I don't think
I'm making myself clear.

52:30.070 --> 52:32.339
I... I just need an introduction,
I'll pay you.

52:32.373 --> 52:36.344
I said I can not help you.
Arrivederci.

52:38.012 --> 52:40.315
But... but you don't understand,
I need...

52:41.681 --> 52:44.051
Ciao! Ciao, ciao!

52:45.791 --> 52:47.334
We have arrived.

53:00.067 --> 53:01.670
Marco!

53:03.036 --> 53:04.972
Look who I found.

53:09.610 --> 53:11.646
Oh!

53:13.114 --> 53:14.615
How'd you find 'em?

53:14.648 --> 53:15.817
At the train station.

53:15.849 --> 53:18.385
What? Taking another nap?

53:18.418 --> 53:19.786
For you it's a nap.

53:19.820 --> 53:21.055
For me it's
watching who comes and goes.

53:21.088 --> 53:22.623
Oh!

53:22.655 --> 53:25.726
Aw, why didn't you call me?

53:25.760 --> 53:27.795
I decided it was best
we just show up.

53:27.827 --> 53:30.030
Uh...

53:30.063 --> 53:31.632
How are you, Laura?

53:31.664 --> 53:33.668
It's weird to see you
without a suit on.

53:33.701 --> 53:35.969
Ah, yeah, it... it's
just as weird for me

53:36.003 --> 53:37.739
to be working with my hands

53:37.771 --> 53:40.440
Marcello!
I'm so glad you're here.

53:40.474 --> 53:42.376
You're just in time
for the harvest.

53:44.411 --> 53:47.581
Hey! This is my wife
and mi figlia.

53:47.614 --> 53:49.750
Marina and Laura!

53:49.938 --> 53:51.719
- Pleased to meet you.
- Oh.

53:51.751 --> 53:53.087
Marcello.

53:53.442 --> 53:55.736
What a beautiful girl.
Just like the mother.

53:55.777 --> 53:57.559
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hi... Oh.

53:58.458 --> 54:00.794
Right, two. Hi. Hello.

54:00.827 --> 54:03.730
Um, so, what... what harvest?

54:03.764 --> 54:05.066
The grapes.

54:05.099 --> 54:07.669
I'm reopening
my Nonno's vineyard.

54:08.768 --> 54:10.670
You're reopening the vineyard?

54:10.704 --> 54:14.409
- Uh-huh.
- Is that why you cleared out our retirement fund?

54:14.442 --> 54:17.778
Uh... I needed money for, uh,

54:17.811 --> 54:19.579
back-taxes

54:19.612 --> 54:21.415
and, uh, wages.

54:21.449 --> 54:24.085
- Oh.
- Had to turn on the electricity.

54:24.117 --> 54:25.920
Uh... uh...

54:25.952 --> 54:28.722
But... but let me show you
your house.

54:28.755 --> 54:30.490
I'm gonna show
them the house.

54:30.523 --> 54:31.659
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:31.692 --> 54:32.994
- The house?
- Yeah, well,

54:33.027 --> 54:35.028
you just stay with them.
Stay with them.

54:35.061 --> 54:37.965
What is even happening?

54:38.278 --> 54:40.572
What are you doing?
Come, come.

55:18.606 --> 55:20.241
Your mother's out
like a light.

55:20.273 --> 55:23.176
Well, that's probably because
she hasn't slept

55:23.210 --> 55:24.778
since you've been gone.

55:30.184 --> 55:32.186
So, can I ask you something?

55:32.219 --> 55:33.688
Of course.

55:33.721 --> 55:35.056
What the fuck, Dad?

55:35.088 --> 55:36.923
Hey!

55:36.956 --> 55:39.159
This mid-life crisis vacation

55:39.193 --> 55:41.028
is not fair to Mom.

55:41.061 --> 55:44.231
It's not a mid-life
crisis vacation.

55:44.264 --> 55:45.532
Then what?

55:45.565 --> 55:47.033
Because whatever it is,

55:47.067 --> 55:48.702
I think we... That she...

55:48.735 --> 55:50.103
deserves to hear about it.

55:50.137 --> 55:51.706
It's complicated.

55:51.739 --> 55:53.007
It's not.

55:53.039 --> 55:54.675
You had a hissy fit
and walked out

55:54.708 --> 55:56.744
on your job, on your wife,

55:56.777 --> 55:57.912
on your life.

55:57.945 --> 55:59.614
When I... When I quit,

55:59.646 --> 56:02.583
I wasn't angry.

56:02.615 --> 56:04.885
I... I felt like I had to run.

56:04.918 --> 56:06.887
You know, uh,

56:06.920 --> 56:09.155
I can actually
relate to that.

56:09.188 --> 56:11.291
I quit school because

56:11.324 --> 56:14.761
I felt all this
pressure from you.

56:14.795 --> 56:17.063
And it was so heavy.

56:17.097 --> 56:19.200
And I felt so lonely.

56:19.233 --> 56:21.936
And all I did
was complain about money.

56:21.969 --> 56:23.971
Well, I tried to talk
to you about it, Dad.

56:24.003 --> 56:26.773
I did and you didn't want
to hear any of it.

56:26.806 --> 56:27.875
When?!

56:27.907 --> 56:28.976
What, you want dates?

56:29.009 --> 56:30.211
Because I... I don't remember!

56:30.244 --> 56:31.946
But what I do I remember is,

56:31.978 --> 56:33.280
is needing to go to
the exact same school as you

56:33.313 --> 56:35.181
and be exactly
the same as you

56:35.215 --> 56:37.852
and you never left any
fucking space for me.

56:39.987 --> 56:43.090
You... you spend all this energy
trying to turn me into you.

56:44.592 --> 56:47.161
And you... you cast
a hell of a shadow, Dad.

56:54.969 --> 56:56.971
I'm really glad you came.

57:12.219 --> 57:13.755
Comfortable?

57:20.027 --> 57:21.795
Listen, Mark,
when we get home,

57:21.829 --> 57:25.066
you need to book an appointment
with Dr. Rosenfeld.

57:25.099 --> 57:26.701
You just got here!

57:26.733 --> 57:29.603
Yeah, well.
We are flying home in two days.

57:29.637 --> 57:30.905
I... I can't.

57:30.938 --> 57:32.340
- You have to.
- Don't I get a say?

57:32.373 --> 57:34.041
- No!
- Can we please talk about it?

57:34.074 --> 57:35.842
Oh, you want to
talk about it now?

57:35.876 --> 57:37.812
Now you want to
talk about it?

57:37.844 --> 57:40.747
Do you know you gave me
12 hours to drop everything

57:40.780 --> 57:43.851
and follow you on some
cockamamie trip to Italy?

57:43.884 --> 57:46.052
You disappear for... for weeks.

57:46.085 --> 57:48.288
You clean out our
retirement fund!

57:48.322 --> 57:50.191
You didn't want to
talk about any of that, though!

57:50.224 --> 57:53.628
- Marina...
- Did I get a say?

57:53.661 --> 57:56.130
Did I? Okay, what else
do you want to talk about?

57:56.163 --> 58:00.233
How you would spend six,
sometimes seven days a week at the office?

58:00.266 --> 58:02.902
Well, I mean, of course that's
when you had a job,

58:02.936 --> 58:06.207
but quitting wasn't something you
felt the need to talk to me about.

58:06.239 --> 58:08.842
And then I arrive here
and you're running a vineyard

58:08.876 --> 58:11.144
and you're making wine like
you're Francis fucking Coppola

58:11.177 --> 58:13.780
and it doesn't even
warrant a call to your wife!

58:18.351 --> 58:21.121
I want to be a team,
I really do.

58:21.155 --> 58:23.257
It's what I signed up for.
But...

58:24.891 --> 58:27.260
if you have changed
your mind about that,

58:29.329 --> 58:31.065
let me know.

58:34.034 --> 58:35.670
Two days.

58:43.943 --> 58:45.712
We should have
these talks more often.

59:04.130 --> 59:07.167
Hey you guys.
Where are you?

59:07.201 --> 59:10.170
Hey, guys,
we're back in business.

59:10.204 --> 59:13.074
That's not what I heard!
I heard you got two days.

59:13.106 --> 59:14.875
Hey, don't worry
about that.

59:14.907 --> 59:16.976
Marco,
why are you doing this?

59:17.010 --> 59:18.813
He's doing
what the priest said.

59:18.846 --> 59:20.313
Serving someone
other than himself.

59:20.347 --> 59:23.084
He wants to be
an altruist!

59:23.117 --> 59:25.052
So?

59:25.085 --> 59:26.387
What's wrong with that?

59:26.420 --> 59:29.222
Can I get a little
support here?

59:29.255 --> 59:31.357
Okay, but it won't be easy.

59:31.391 --> 59:33.394
So. What's easy?

59:33.427 --> 59:36.163
Sure, but we have a union!
We'll have demands!

59:36.195 --> 59:38.199
Okay, I'll hear them.

59:38.231 --> 59:40.434
Don't listen to him.
That one's a communist.

59:40.467 --> 59:42.970
Oh-ho!
Spoken like a true fascist!

59:43.003 --> 59:45.072
Come on.
Can I count on you guys?

59:45.105 --> 59:48.409
Atención a tutti!
We're back in the wine business!

59:51.445 --> 59:53.914
Thank you. Thank you.

59:54.344 --> 59:55.554
Do you believe this?

59:56.449 --> 59:58.218
A wine union!

59:58.251 --> 59:59.820
I ask you.

1:00:09.829 --> 1:00:11.398
Who were you talking to?

1:00:13.099 --> 1:00:14.969
- When?
- Just now.

1:00:15.001 --> 1:00:16.403
Myself.

1:00:18.204 --> 1:00:19.773
No.

1:00:21.574 --> 1:00:23.510
I was talking to the vines.

1:00:24.945 --> 1:00:26.480
You're talking to the plants.

1:00:26.512 --> 1:00:29.150
They seem to like it.

1:00:29.182 --> 1:00:31.385
Marcello does it all the time.

1:00:31.418 --> 1:00:33.454
Sometimes he yells at them.

1:00:35.054 --> 1:00:36.123
Oh.

1:00:37.490 --> 1:00:39.025
Did you tell
him we're flying back?

1:00:39.059 --> 1:00:40.894
Oh, I certainly did.

1:00:40.927 --> 1:00:43.163
He's talking to the vines now.

1:00:43.197 --> 1:00:45.900
You know,
I am standing right here.

1:00:45.932 --> 1:00:47.934
So is this like
a "Field of Dreams" thing?

1:00:47.967 --> 1:00:50.203
If you brew it, he will come?

1:00:50.237 --> 1:00:53.206
Voices telling you
to make Chianti?

1:00:53.239 --> 1:00:54.574
That's how much you know.

1:00:54.608 --> 1:00:56.577
You can't grow Chianti here.

1:00:56.610 --> 1:00:59.512
Ours are Aglianico grapes.

1:00:59.545 --> 1:01:01.481
Aglianico del Vulture.

1:01:01.514 --> 1:01:03.817
Ah brava!

1:01:03.851 --> 1:01:05.419
Our bella knows her wine!

1:01:08.387 --> 1:01:10.190
You're not encouraging
my husband's

1:01:10.224 --> 1:01:11.893
delusional behaviors,
are you?

1:01:12.214 --> 1:01:13.757
Excuse me please.

1:01:15.133 --> 1:01:17.386
What's going on? Is there a
party here?

1:01:17.427 --> 1:01:19.388
You have your hands in your
pockets?

1:01:19.429 --> 1:01:22.057
The vineyard is over there.
Let's get to work!

1:01:22.099 --> 1:01:23.475
Let's get to work.

1:01:24.237 --> 1:01:26.005
Hey, Deputy!

1:01:26.039 --> 1:01:30.544
I came for crowd control.
Special duty.

1:01:30.577 --> 1:01:33.347
It's like stopping a moving freight train.
I don't know what to do.

1:01:33.380 --> 1:01:35.015
We stay on course.

1:01:35.047 --> 1:01:37.117
He's coming home
and that's all there is to it.

1:01:57.170 --> 1:01:59.039
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

1:02:02.681 --> 1:02:03.932
My name is Gio.

1:02:04.892 --> 1:02:06.476
I'm Laura.

1:02:08.228 --> 1:02:09.646
Pleased to meet you.

1:02:12.065 --> 1:02:14.902
It's raining, but it's
beautiful at any time.

1:02:15.021 --> 1:02:16.324
Mm-hmm.

1:02:18.291 --> 1:02:20.159
I'm Italian.

1:02:20.193 --> 1:02:22.028
No, I can see
and hear that, yes.

1:02:25.231 --> 1:02:27.567
You are make here
from Canada?

1:02:27.601 --> 1:02:29.036
Yes.

1:02:30.036 --> 1:02:32.572
♪ Life is a highway ♪

1:02:32.606 --> 1:02:36.477
♪ I want to ride it
all night long ♪

1:02:36.510 --> 1:02:39.113
Tom Cochrane!

1:02:39.146 --> 1:02:40.314
Do you know him?

1:02:40.347 --> 1:02:41.682
Yeah, we're neighbors.
Yeah.

1:02:41.715 --> 1:02:44.418
We live next to each other.

1:02:49.088 --> 1:02:50.157
- Oh!
- Oh!

1:02:50.190 --> 1:02:52.025
Ah!

1:02:52.059 --> 1:02:53.294
What planet am I on?

1:02:53.327 --> 1:02:54.595
Italia.

1:02:54.628 --> 1:02:55.963
Yeah.

1:02:55.996 --> 1:02:57.597
It's close to Mars.

1:03:00.400 --> 1:03:02.102
Do you like it thus far?

1:03:02.135 --> 1:03:04.638
I like it, yeah.

1:03:04.670 --> 1:03:08.308
I like it.
It's a little cold... Uh...

1:03:08.342 --> 1:03:11.211
Colder than I thought.
A little bit more than I thought.

1:03:11.244 --> 1:03:13.648
The movies don't
show you that.

1:03:20.592 --> 1:03:23.428
Hold on, Marco. Hold on.

1:03:23.470 --> 1:03:25.389
When you push the cap down

1:03:25.430 --> 1:03:27.182
the gas comes up from the
bottom.

1:03:27.224 --> 1:03:28.892
It's carbon dioxide.

1:03:28.934 --> 1:03:30.269
CO2

1:03:30.310 --> 1:03:32.396
Don't breathe in the gas.

1:03:32.437 --> 1:03:33.814
You'll faint.

1:03:33.856 --> 1:03:35.440
You look at the candles.

1:03:35.482 --> 1:03:38.735
If the light in the candles is
out, it's dangerous.

1:03:38.777 --> 1:03:40.946
It means there's no oxygen.

1:03:40.988 --> 1:03:41.655
You understand?

1:03:41.697 --> 1:03:43.949
You have to run out...
leave the door open.

1:03:44.244 --> 1:03:46.543
Candles. Blow 'em out if
you don't want to start a fire.

1:03:46.577 --> 1:03:48.248
- You understand?
- Si.

1:03:55.255 --> 1:03:56.691
Hey, Papa.

1:04:02.061 --> 1:04:03.663
- Mr. Marco!
- Ho!

1:04:03.697 --> 1:04:05.231
Oh, scusi.

1:04:05.264 --> 1:04:08.101
Um, can I make
talk with you?

1:04:08.135 --> 1:04:10.671
Si.

1:04:10.704 --> 1:04:14.041
Enzo used to work
at the barrel company.

1:04:14.074 --> 1:04:17.744
But, they, you know, close.

1:04:21.414 --> 1:04:23.416
Um...

1:04:23.449 --> 1:04:28.254
It was no good.
I... I lose, uh, my wife.

1:04:28.288 --> 1:04:31.726
My house.
I move into this shack.

1:04:33.360 --> 1:04:35.528
Eh, it's the story of Enzo.

1:04:36.730 --> 1:04:39.333
Well, I'm sorry
for your trouble, Enzo.

1:04:39.365 --> 1:04:41.201
Oh, no, no.

1:04:41.298 --> 1:04:43.675
No, you don't understand.

1:04:43.709 --> 1:04:45.372
Before you open,

1:04:45.405 --> 1:04:49.176
when people see Enzo
uh, in the town,

1:04:49.208 --> 1:04:53.114
they say "Go away Enzo!
You stink! You bum!"

1:04:54.748 --> 1:04:56.617
But now,

1:04:56.650 --> 1:04:58.418
when they see me

1:04:59.452 --> 1:05:00.721
they smile.

1:05:02.088 --> 1:05:06.293
You have made
Acerenza very happy.

1:05:07.693 --> 1:05:09.462
Thank you.

1:05:09.496 --> 1:05:10.664
I, uh...

1:05:12.364 --> 1:05:16.403
I still have friends
at the barrel company.

1:05:20.840 --> 1:05:25.445
Enzo is retire no more.

1:05:27.514 --> 1:05:30.617
You want barrel?
Enzo get you barrel.

1:05:33.119 --> 1:05:34.521
Well,

1:05:35.588 --> 1:05:37.123
I need barrels.

1:05:38.557 --> 1:05:39.760
Thank you.

1:05:39.793 --> 1:05:41.260
Prego.

1:05:41.293 --> 1:05:43.830
Okay!

1:05:45.195 --> 1:05:46.321
Let's go.

1:06:07.820 --> 1:06:09.722
- Come on...
- What, no...

1:06:09.755 --> 1:06:11.357
I know we're
leaving tomorrow,

1:06:11.391 --> 1:06:13.494
but you've got to try this
at least once.

1:06:13.527 --> 1:06:15.628
Are there not machines
for this sort of thing?

1:06:15.661 --> 1:06:17.530
Yes, but Marcello says

1:06:17.563 --> 1:06:20.166
that he wants to do
30 percent of the wine

1:06:20.199 --> 1:06:22.735
in the traditional way
as good luck.

1:06:22.768 --> 1:06:24.637
- Uh, he does, does he?
- Uh-huh.

1:06:26.806 --> 1:06:28.608
It's the secret ingredient.

1:06:28.641 --> 1:06:30.877
Foot fungus
is your secret ingredient?

1:06:32.179 --> 1:06:34.447
- Get in.
- Here.

1:06:37.217 --> 1:06:38.751
Watch out for the stems.

1:06:39.920 --> 1:06:41.722
How does it feel?

1:06:41.755 --> 1:06:44.224
Ew! Ew! I can feel
the grapes

1:06:44.257 --> 1:06:45.893
popping under my feet.

1:06:45.925 --> 1:06:47.594
Oh!

1:06:47.626 --> 1:06:51.297
Marina, you look like,
uh, right there...

1:06:51.331 --> 1:06:53.599
You look like... like
Audrey Hepburn

1:06:53.632 --> 1:06:55.568
in the movie
with Gregory Peck.

1:06:55.601 --> 1:06:57.336
In Rome,
the Trevi Fountain,

1:06:57.369 --> 1:06:59.405
when they're splashing
around in the water...

1:06:59.438 --> 1:07:01.274
- Wait, "Roman Holiday"?
- Yeah.

1:07:01.307 --> 1:07:03.242
- No, you have your movies mixed up.
- Huh?

1:07:03.275 --> 1:07:05.444
You're thinking of
Anita Ekberg

1:07:05.478 --> 1:07:07.748
and Marcello Mastroianni

1:07:07.780 --> 1:07:09.416
in the Trevi fountain.

1:07:09.449 --> 1:07:12.853
W-what was the name
of the movie?

1:07:12.885 --> 1:07:14.855
Come on, you don't remember
the name of that movie?

1:07:14.887 --> 1:07:17.690
No, you're the
artsy movie aficionado.

1:07:18.992 --> 1:07:22.829
Please, I'm not
an aficionado of anything.

1:07:24.463 --> 1:07:26.232
I haven't done anything
arty in years,

1:07:26.266 --> 1:07:28.335
unless you count
dental floss bus ads.

1:07:28.367 --> 1:07:31.271
Ooh!

1:07:32.539 --> 1:07:35.609
I don't know if I want to kiss

1:07:35.641 --> 1:07:37.644
a man with purple feet.

1:07:39.311 --> 1:07:42.516
Am I...
Am I chasing you

1:07:42.548 --> 1:07:45.219
for a kiss or...

1:07:45.251 --> 1:07:46.719
a movie title?

1:07:54.293 --> 1:07:56.429
"La Dolce Vita".

1:07:58.831 --> 1:07:59.967
Yes.

1:08:02.302 --> 1:08:03.804
It is a sweet life.

1:08:05.739 --> 1:08:07.574
No, silly,

1:08:07.606 --> 1:08:09.909
that's the title
of the movie!

1:08:27.894 --> 1:08:29.630
Okay, what happened?

1:08:30.663 --> 1:08:33.300
Uh... er,
I... You know,

1:08:33.332 --> 1:08:35.501
I was just thinking that maybe

1:08:35.534 --> 1:08:37.703
I would... I would stay another...
A couple of days.

1:08:37.737 --> 1:08:38.872
Oh, my God...

1:08:38.904 --> 1:08:40.506
You had sex in the wine!

1:08:40.539 --> 1:08:42.275
No, it's not wine yet.

1:08:42.309 --> 1:08:43.777
Yeah, I'm never gonna be able
to drink wine again.

1:08:43.810 --> 1:08:46.380
No, we didn't!

1:08:46.412 --> 1:08:48.447
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Mom!

1:08:48.480 --> 1:08:49.548
This is...

1:08:49.582 --> 1:08:50.651
I know...

1:08:53.019 --> 1:08:54.688
So...

1:08:56.488 --> 1:08:58.424
Is everything okay?

1:08:58.457 --> 1:09:00.059
Yeah.

1:09:00.092 --> 1:09:01.994
Mm-hmm.

1:09:02.028 --> 1:09:03.564
Is everything purple?

1:09:05.064 --> 1:09:09.502
Uh... No,
not... not everything.

1:09:09.536 --> 1:09:12.372
No, you sure? Let me check.

1:09:12.404 --> 1:09:14.840
Don't lie to me, Marco.
Don't lie to me.

1:09:14.873 --> 1:09:16.510
You're kidding, right?

1:09:16.542 --> 1:09:18.711
Well, what's another
couple of days?

1:09:18.744 --> 1:09:20.881
Mom! After he left you?

1:09:20.913 --> 1:09:22.815
After he's risking
your entire future.

1:09:22.849 --> 1:09:25.619
Everything you guys
have built together.

1:09:25.652 --> 1:09:26.987
Look, I really think you need

1:09:27.020 --> 1:09:28.722
to take him away
from this fairy tale.

1:09:28.755 --> 1:09:30.090
Listen...

1:09:30.122 --> 1:09:31.724
Look, I'm having
a hard time looking at you

1:09:31.757 --> 1:09:33.092
while you're purple.

1:09:33.126 --> 1:09:34.795
Oh, I know!

1:09:34.828 --> 1:09:36.763
I can't...
I can't fly when I'm purple.

1:09:36.796 --> 1:09:38.798
Try explaining this
to customs, huh?

1:09:38.832 --> 1:09:40.801
Mom, I have to
get home, though.

1:09:40.833 --> 1:09:42.635
I have an actual life.

1:09:42.668 --> 1:09:43.804
You get that right?

1:09:43.837 --> 1:09:46.073
I know you do. I'm just...

1:09:46.105 --> 1:09:48.007
I was just hoping
that you might consider

1:09:48.041 --> 1:09:50.377
spending a little while longer.

1:09:50.409 --> 1:09:53.079
- Just a tiny little bit.
- Don't do that!

1:09:53.113 --> 1:09:54.681
You sure those are
wine stains

1:09:54.713 --> 1:09:56.716
or are you just
drinking the Kool-Aid?

1:09:56.750 --> 1:09:58.085
Oh, you're funny.

1:09:58.118 --> 1:09:59.920
You're a funny girl.

1:09:59.953 --> 1:10:02.989
Come on,
just think about it.

1:10:03.021 --> 1:10:05.024
- Mom, maybe don't get so close to me because...
- Why?

1:10:05.057 --> 1:10:07.027
I feel like
this purple's contagious.

1:10:07.060 --> 1:10:08.495
No!

1:11:50.227 --> 1:11:53.313
Midway through the passage of
life's journey,

1:11:53.355 --> 1:11:56.191
I found myself in a dark
forest,

1:11:56.233 --> 1:11:59.319
where the right path was lost.

1:11:59.872 --> 1:12:01.807
- Come on, come on. Dad!
- Marco...

1:12:01.841 --> 1:12:03.243
Come on!

1:12:03.275 --> 1:12:04.845
Dad?

1:12:04.877 --> 1:12:07.079
There we go.
There we go. Okay.

1:12:07.113 --> 1:12:09.149
Hey. Are you okay?

1:12:09.181 --> 1:12:10.649
Did you not see that
the candles were out?

1:12:10.682 --> 1:12:12.118
What candles?

1:12:12.150 --> 1:12:14.086
Mom, they're a fail safe.

1:12:14.119 --> 1:12:15.555
From the punch down gas.

1:12:15.587 --> 1:12:17.256
There's too much
CO2 in here.

1:12:17.289 --> 1:12:19.658
You have to air it out before
you come charging in to work

1:12:19.692 --> 1:12:21.161
- Take it easy!
- Dad! Dad, Dad!

1:12:21.194 --> 1:12:23.697
Take it easy.
Okay, let me get him... Okay.

1:12:23.729 --> 1:12:25.197
Okay, okay.

1:12:25.230 --> 1:12:27.666
It's okay. We're right here.

1:12:27.699 --> 1:12:29.001
How do you know all that?

1:12:29.034 --> 1:12:30.670
How did he not know that?

1:12:30.703 --> 1:12:32.506
You could've fallen
in the vat and drowned.

1:12:32.538 --> 1:12:33.840
Oh!

1:12:33.872 --> 1:12:35.040
What a way to go.

1:12:38.877 --> 1:12:40.613
Grazie!

1:12:41.111 --> 1:12:42.738
Thank you so much.

1:12:42.748 --> 1:12:43.817
Ciao!

1:12:44.817 --> 1:12:46.520
You rebooking your flight?

1:12:46.552 --> 1:12:49.588
- No, I did that already.
- Oh!

1:12:49.622 --> 1:12:51.191
Yes, I did do that.

1:12:51.224 --> 1:12:53.293
I was just talking to the...

1:12:53.326 --> 1:12:58.597
Denominazione di Origine
Controllata e Garantita.

1:12:58.631 --> 1:12:59.900
Is that the wine board?

1:12:59.932 --> 1:13:01.635
Uh, yeah, more or less.
Basically,

1:13:01.667 --> 1:13:02.969
if Dad wants to be
taken seriously,

1:13:03.002 --> 1:13:05.038
he has certified by the DOCG.

1:13:05.070 --> 1:13:08.173
- Otherwise he's just gonna be another amateur winemaker.
- Mm.

1:13:08.207 --> 1:13:10.844
Uh, so now I'm an amateur?

1:13:10.877 --> 1:13:12.879
Uh, no.
I was just saying to Mom

1:13:12.912 --> 1:13:14.581
that you have to be certified.

1:13:14.613 --> 1:13:15.648
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1:13:15.681 --> 1:13:17.850
- And crazy.
- Well...

1:13:17.884 --> 1:13:20.153
So how are you feeling?

1:13:21.320 --> 1:13:22.822
Okay.

1:13:22.854 --> 1:13:24.156
I was on
a call with these guys,

1:13:24.189 --> 1:13:25.724
they said you have
to be certified.

1:13:25.757 --> 1:13:27.626
There's a process
and these are

1:13:27.659 --> 1:13:29.162
the steps you have to
go through.

1:13:29.194 --> 1:13:32.032
- So you're not going home?
- Well, I am leaving.

1:13:32.064 --> 1:13:33.899
But I think if you're
gonna do this insane thing,

1:13:33.932 --> 1:13:35.569
you might as well do it right.

1:13:35.601 --> 1:13:38.872
Oh, thank you, bella.

1:13:38.904 --> 1:13:41.140
Thinking about
joining the organization?

1:13:41.173 --> 1:13:43.743
No, no, but you do...
Listen to me!

1:13:43.775 --> 1:13:45.211
You have to bring in
your samples by Friday

1:13:45.243 --> 1:13:46.813
or else you have to
do this next year.

1:13:46.845 --> 1:13:49.014
- Mm.
- You have an appointment at 11:00.

1:13:49.047 --> 1:13:50.349
No, wait.

1:13:50.382 --> 1:13:52.786
The samples are not
gonna be ready.

1:13:52.819 --> 1:13:54.220
You have vats full of them.

1:13:54.252 --> 1:13:56.155
No, it's not wine.

1:13:56.189 --> 1:13:58.124
It's gotta be put into barrels,

1:13:58.157 --> 1:13:59.292
then... then aged.

1:13:59.324 --> 1:14:01.827
Er, it takes a year.

1:14:01.860 --> 1:14:05.064
While your wine is aging,
what are you gonna do?

1:14:05.097 --> 1:14:06.265
Wait.

1:14:06.298 --> 1:14:08.068
Why don't you
come back home

1:14:08.100 --> 1:14:10.603
and then you can come back
once the wine is aged?

1:14:10.636 --> 1:14:12.605
No. These people...

1:14:14.106 --> 1:14:16.743
They're depending on me.
I made them a promise.

1:14:16.775 --> 1:14:18.043
No, no, no, no, Mark.

1:14:18.077 --> 1:14:20.046
No, we cannot afford
to sit around

1:14:20.078 --> 1:14:22.948
and wait an entire year
while your wine ages.

1:14:22.981 --> 1:14:24.818
Why not?

1:14:24.850 --> 1:14:28.020
Yeah, easy to forget in
all the fun and grape-stomping,

1:14:28.054 --> 1:14:30.190
but we have
a life back home.

1:14:30.222 --> 1:14:31.992
No, not a life.
Jobs.

1:14:32.024 --> 1:14:34.126
Yes, I have a job.

1:14:34.159 --> 1:14:35.327
Yeah, not a life.

1:14:35.360 --> 1:14:36.829
You said yourself.

1:14:36.863 --> 1:14:38.832
We were distant.

1:14:38.864 --> 1:14:41.701
All right, but a vacation
in Italy doesn't fix that.

1:14:41.734 --> 1:14:43.336
It's a Band-Aid.

1:14:43.368 --> 1:14:47.006
So, let's...
let's tear the Band-Aid off. I mean,

1:14:47.039 --> 1:14:49.042
we've been
working our butts off.

1:14:49.074 --> 1:14:51.344
It's not a vacation.
It's a...

1:14:51.377 --> 1:14:53.080
It's a new life.

1:14:54.380 --> 1:14:56.216
Good luck with your barrels.

1:15:02.044 --> 1:15:03.337
See!

1:15:03.355 --> 1:15:04.791
Barrels.

1:15:04.823 --> 1:15:07.092
Enzo is still good
for something.

1:15:08.761 --> 1:15:11.365
Enzo, I'm proud of ya.

1:15:21.407 --> 1:15:23.043
What the...?

1:15:26.712 --> 1:15:28.313
- Hey!
- John!

1:15:28.346 --> 1:15:31.384
- Don't I know you?
- What are you doing here?

1:15:31.417 --> 1:15:33.086
Well, I was in Rome.

1:15:33.118 --> 1:15:34.753
Thought I'd pay you a visit.

1:15:34.787 --> 1:15:37.123
A nice, leisurely
five-hour drive.

1:15:37.155 --> 1:15:39.091
What, are you keeping an eye on me?

1:15:39.125 --> 1:15:40.760
Uh, well, you know,

1:15:40.792 --> 1:15:42.996
I heard through the grapevine
you were here.

1:15:43.029 --> 1:15:45.131
- See how I did that? You get it?
- Mm-hmm.

1:15:46.932 --> 1:15:48.835
So you came back
to your motherland, huh?

1:15:48.868 --> 1:15:51.371
- Yeah.
- How's the wine business?

1:15:51.404 --> 1:15:55.742
Uh, you know,
having fun losing my shirt.

1:15:55.774 --> 1:15:57.344
That's an interesting
business model.

1:15:59.412 --> 1:16:01.914
You want the latest
Santius update?

1:16:01.948 --> 1:16:03.450
So...

1:16:03.483 --> 1:16:06.019
after you left,
so did half the R&D department.

1:16:06.051 --> 1:16:08.121
You're gonna
walk out like that?

1:16:08.154 --> 1:16:10.757
You can't walk out
on your contracts.

1:16:10.789 --> 1:16:14.327
Anybody with any talent
went to a different company.

1:16:16.462 --> 1:16:18.331
The stock prices.

1:16:18.363 --> 1:16:21.000
The stock prices went down
like a 747.

1:16:25.904 --> 1:16:28.407
So, long story short:

1:16:28.440 --> 1:16:30.743
Cavendish is out.

1:16:33.179 --> 1:16:36.483
I... I have zero interest
in coming back.

1:16:36.515 --> 1:16:38.018
Okay. All right.

1:16:39.118 --> 1:16:40.887
But, just know
that if you did,

1:16:40.920 --> 1:16:42.989
any company would be
glad to have you.

1:16:43.021 --> 1:16:44.423
You can pretty much
name your own price.

1:16:44.457 --> 1:16:47.827
Yeah, well,
I... I have a job.

1:16:47.859 --> 1:16:49.194
I'm happy.

1:16:49.228 --> 1:16:52.765
Okay. All right,
just hear me out, okay?

1:16:52.798 --> 1:16:54.833
I've got the perfect
opportunity for you.

1:16:54.867 --> 1:16:56.802
It's a hotel chain.

1:16:56.836 --> 1:16:59.405
Not too many locations.
Just twelve worldwide.

1:16:59.438 --> 1:17:00.940
Here's the big thing...

1:17:00.972 --> 1:17:02.542
They're restructuring.

1:17:02.574 --> 1:17:04.978
One hundred percent
green policy.

1:17:05.011 --> 1:17:07.080
- Progressive.
- Mm-hmm.

1:17:07.113 --> 1:17:08.882
I thought that might
interest you.

1:17:08.914 --> 1:17:12.051
I know how hard you
pushed for that with Santius.

1:17:12.083 --> 1:17:14.186
But, you know,
if you're not interested.

1:17:14.220 --> 1:17:15.454
Ooh...

1:17:15.488 --> 1:17:17.190
Restructured how?

1:17:19.391 --> 1:17:21.027
- It's good to see you again.
- Same here, John.

1:17:21.060 --> 1:17:22.228
Best to your family.

1:17:22.261 --> 1:17:23.897
Thanks.
You'll let me know?

1:17:23.930 --> 1:17:26.231
Yeah, I'll text you
a time and place.

1:17:26.265 --> 1:17:28.135
All right.

1:17:29.900 --> 1:17:30.859
Lawyer!

1:17:32.319 --> 1:17:33.153
What's up?

1:17:33.195 --> 1:17:35.155
It's time.

1:17:36.074 --> 1:17:37.741
- What?
- It's time.

1:17:38.010 --> 1:17:39.079
Ah!

1:17:42.081 --> 1:17:43.150
Marco.

1:17:43.455 --> 1:17:44.998
The process is very simple.

1:17:45.040 --> 1:17:46.250
There's where the wine
ferments.

1:17:46.291 --> 1:17:46.834
Understand?

1:17:46.875 --> 1:17:49.086
The wine ferments for eight
days.

1:17:49.127 --> 1:17:52.589
There is a tube that will
bring it here.

1:17:52.631 --> 1:17:55.926
This tube goes into the
bunghole.

1:17:55.968 --> 1:17:56.468
Understand?

1:17:56.510 --> 1:18:00.806
Then, when it's full you take it out
and place it in the other opening.

1:18:00.848 --> 1:18:01.974
Until you've done all
the barrels.

1:18:02.268 --> 1:18:04.837
So we just have to spear
all these bungholes.

1:18:04.871 --> 1:18:08.341
Yeah you gotta make sure
you slide in the hole.

1:18:08.373 --> 1:18:09.475
Can you do that?

1:18:15.863 --> 1:18:17.531
What is it? What is it?

1:18:23.122 --> 1:18:24.524
Oh, honey,

1:18:26.524 --> 1:18:29.161
- I'm... I'm so sad you're leaving.
- Mm.

1:18:29.194 --> 1:18:31.965
But I'm so happy you came.

1:18:34.900 --> 1:18:36.603
- You got a ride to the airport?
- Yeah, uh,

1:18:36.636 --> 1:18:38.404
Gio keeps offering
to drive me, so...

1:18:38.436 --> 1:18:40.873
You know,
you could miss that flight.

1:18:40.907 --> 1:18:42.876
- If you wanted.
- Okay...

1:18:42.908 --> 1:18:44.543
Hey, remember the DOGC
is still coming

1:18:44.577 --> 1:18:46.613
- to get that sample at 11:00.
- Oh, shit.

1:18:47.512 --> 1:18:48.914
Marcello!

1:18:48.948 --> 1:18:50.617
Meeting now!

1:18:50.649 --> 1:18:53.385
Marcello, something
important came up.

1:18:53.418 --> 1:18:55.889
An opportunity.
Uh, the timing is terrible.

1:18:55.921 --> 1:18:58.557
The DOGC guy is coming today.

1:18:59.031 --> 1:19:00.525
Patience, lawyer. Patience.

1:19:00.559 --> 1:19:02.328
No, no,
it's gotta be now.

1:19:02.360 --> 1:19:06.965
I have a meeting
with a hotel chain in Rome.

1:19:06.998 --> 1:19:08.434
- For work?
- We'll see.

1:19:08.582 --> 1:19:10.792
Lawyer, the wine
hasn't aged yet.

1:19:10.834 --> 1:19:12.536
We will have nothing
to show them.

1:19:12.570 --> 1:19:17.542
No, no, you told me
that you make wine every year.

1:19:17.576 --> 1:19:19.511
Three, four cases, yes?

1:19:19.760 --> 1:19:21.011
Or... more.

1:19:21.113 --> 1:19:23.950
Okay, so same process
my grandfather taught you.

1:19:23.983 --> 1:19:26.219
Same vine, same soil,

1:19:26.252 --> 1:19:28.021
same French oak barrels.

1:19:28.054 --> 1:19:29.389
Si. Si.

1:19:29.421 --> 1:19:32.491
I give to him the oak barrel

1:19:32.524 --> 1:19:35.961
and then he give to me
my beautiful house.

1:19:36.693 --> 1:19:37.778
Great.

1:19:37.819 --> 1:19:39.696
Now the secret is out.

1:19:39.738 --> 1:19:44.201
Enzo got me a few barrels,
I let him squat.

1:19:44.235 --> 1:19:46.204
Don't worry, that's...

1:19:46.238 --> 1:19:48.499
but the wine!
The wine!

1:19:48.533 --> 1:19:50.123
My wine is the same wine.

1:19:51.250 --> 1:19:55.087
We can give it to the jury to
be certified.

1:19:55.213 --> 1:19:56.682
Si. Si.

1:19:58.583 --> 1:19:59.952
What time
does your flight leave?

1:20:02.354 --> 1:20:06.259
Uh, call me as soon as
they render their decision.

1:20:06.292 --> 1:20:09.195
Yeah, we're going now.

1:20:09.228 --> 1:20:10.563
Good luck.

1:20:17.336 --> 1:20:19.239
Now you're talkin'.

1:20:26.278 --> 1:20:28.213
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

1:21:24.676 --> 1:21:26.553
Thank you for the opportunity.

1:21:30.516 --> 1:21:32.518
My grandfather's wine.

1:21:52.597 --> 1:21:55.268
Just taste the damn stuff,
will ya?

1:22:26.822 --> 1:22:29.491
Are you ready to go to
the airport?

1:22:33.036 --> 1:22:35.080
It was a pleasure to meet you.

1:22:35.122 --> 1:22:37.249
Thank you.

1:22:37.291 --> 1:22:38.333
Thank you.

1:22:58.296 --> 1:22:59.831
Is that the certification?

1:22:59.864 --> 1:23:02.801
This is it.

1:23:02.835 --> 1:23:04.569
Oh, what a day!

1:23:04.603 --> 1:23:06.139
The wine has been certified

1:23:06.171 --> 1:23:07.806
and your father's
coming back home to work.

1:23:07.840 --> 1:23:09.509
- What do you mean?
- Yes, he called.

1:23:09.542 --> 1:23:11.310
He's coming back
tomorrow morning

1:23:11.342 --> 1:23:12.677
because everything worked out
with the hotel chain.

1:23:12.711 --> 1:23:15.148
I mean, this whole
Italian adventure

1:23:15.180 --> 1:23:16.915
has somehow
fixed everything!

1:23:18.552 --> 1:23:20.619
What a magnificent day,
Mrs. Gentile.

1:23:20.653 --> 1:23:21.887
Si, si.

1:23:27.592 --> 1:23:28.795
Hi.

1:23:34.598 --> 1:23:36.058
You look sad.

1:23:36.335 --> 1:23:38.738
Um...

1:23:38.770 --> 1:23:40.405
I know I shouldn't be upset.

1:23:40.439 --> 1:23:42.375
I've been trying to leave
ever since I got here,

1:23:42.408 --> 1:23:43.643
but I finally get why

1:23:43.676 --> 1:23:45.378
this place is
so special to him.

1:23:45.412 --> 1:23:47.236
Acerenza is special.

1:23:48.346 --> 1:23:49.782
I feel so...
connected to it.

1:23:49.814 --> 1:23:53.351
Like, I... I finally get exactly
where I came from.

1:23:53.385 --> 1:23:55.922
And it might be the sweet
Italian air clouding my judgment,

1:23:55.954 --> 1:24:01.327
but ever since we got this,

1:24:01.359 --> 1:24:04.529
it's like I have this
rush of ideas, you know?

1:24:04.563 --> 1:24:07.266
Like, um, like a picture
of a life that...

1:24:07.298 --> 1:24:10.403
That washes over you
in a split second.

1:24:10.435 --> 1:24:11.938
You have no idea
what I'm talking about, right?

1:24:11.970 --> 1:24:13.405
Sorry.

1:24:17.743 --> 1:24:20.780
Now that it's, uh,
coming to an end,

1:24:22.780 --> 1:24:24.250
I feel sad.

1:24:25.023 --> 1:24:26.900
Sad.

1:24:26.918 --> 1:24:28.320
End?

1:24:28.354 --> 1:24:31.923
My father is leaving.

1:24:31.957 --> 1:24:34.494
Uh, he's taking the job
with the hotels.

1:24:35.728 --> 1:24:36.796
Uh, mi papa.

1:24:36.828 --> 1:24:38.730
- Si, Marco.
- Marco...

1:24:38.764 --> 1:24:40.632
is leaving.

1:24:42.207 --> 1:24:43.792
Your father is leaving?

1:24:43.868 --> 1:24:44.903
Mm-hmm.

1:24:46.271 --> 1:24:48.774
Oh, I'll get the...
the thing.

1:24:51.743 --> 1:24:52.911
One sec.

1:25:02.978 --> 1:25:05.439
Marco Gentile is leaving.
He got a new job.

1:25:16.801 --> 1:25:19.471
So, let's have a drink, huh?

1:25:21.372 --> 1:25:22.907
Si.

1:25:22.940 --> 1:25:24.810
Vino

1:25:26.078 --> 1:25:27.847
Salute.

1:25:27.880 --> 1:25:29.448
Cheers!

1:25:29.480 --> 1:25:31.884
Yes!

1:25:31.917 --> 1:25:33.620
Cheers! Exactly.

1:25:59.409 --> 1:26:00.744
Put your feet down.

1:26:20.765 --> 1:26:22.467
Mm.

1:26:23.016 --> 1:26:24.434
There's nothing left
to do, huh?

1:26:25.570 --> 1:26:26.672
What?

1:26:40.784 --> 1:26:43.036
I heard you're closing the vineyard.

1:26:43.078 --> 1:26:45.038
First it gave us hope.

1:26:45.080 --> 1:26:48.625
But now you want to ruin us
and our families.

1:26:49.761 --> 1:26:50.996
Uh...

1:26:51.029 --> 1:26:52.631
They're mad at me.

1:26:52.663 --> 1:26:54.032
Yes, they are.

1:26:54.065 --> 1:26:55.501
They think you're
closing down the business.

1:26:55.533 --> 1:26:56.969
How are you feeling?

1:26:57.002 --> 1:26:59.872
Okay.
Who's our PR person?

1:26:59.904 --> 1:27:01.407
I don't know, why?
What do you mean?

1:27:01.439 --> 1:27:03.541
Everybody thinks
we're shutting down!

1:27:03.574 --> 1:27:04.909
What?
I didn't say anything.

1:27:04.943 --> 1:27:06.612
But maybe... maybe Laura?

1:27:06.645 --> 1:27:07.980
- Laura!
- Wha... She's still here?

1:27:08.012 --> 1:27:09.681
Yes, I think she's out back.

1:27:09.715 --> 1:27:10.783
Laura!

1:27:12.083 --> 1:27:14.686
- Hey!
- Hey!

1:27:14.720 --> 1:27:16.555
- Where have you been?
- Um...

1:27:16.587 --> 1:27:18.724
I was up late paying bills
and then we...

1:27:18.756 --> 1:27:20.058
We went out.

1:27:20.091 --> 1:27:22.394
- What is...
- Oh, my God.

1:27:22.409 --> 1:27:25.621
What are you doing? Make sure
her father doesn't find out.

1:27:27.032 --> 1:27:28.801
What did you tell
these people?

1:27:28.833 --> 1:27:30.869
I didn't tell them anything.

1:27:30.903 --> 1:27:33.539
We gotta get you Rosetta Stone.

1:27:41.512 --> 1:27:44.949
Okay, so I went
to Rome last night

1:27:44.983 --> 1:27:47.086
for a business meeting,
that's true.

1:27:47.118 --> 1:27:49.087
A small boutique hotel chain.

1:27:49.121 --> 1:27:51.657
They were interested in me
to run their business.

1:27:51.689 --> 1:27:53.692
I brought Marcello's wine.

1:27:53.725 --> 1:27:55.461
They drank it.

1:27:55.493 --> 1:27:58.063
They loved it and, uh...

1:27:58.095 --> 1:28:01.099
starting next year,

1:28:01.132 --> 1:28:03.469
we are going to be
the premier wine maker

1:28:03.502 --> 1:28:05.604
for the entire chain
of the hotels.

1:28:05.636 --> 1:28:09.442
So, everybody,
we still have a job.

1:28:09.475 --> 1:28:10.910
We're still in business!

1:28:10.943 --> 1:28:13.512
Marco, Marco.
They don't understand a word.

1:28:13.544 --> 1:28:16.588
I'm going to translate
what he said.

1:28:16.630 --> 1:28:19.132
You didn't understand anything
he was saying, right?

1:28:19.174 --> 1:28:21.468
The vineyard is staying open!

1:28:43.532 --> 1:28:44.950
I told you it was going
to get done.

1:28:50.148 --> 1:28:54.819
We're gonna need someone
who is compassionate,

1:28:54.853 --> 1:29:00.158
knows wine,
and doesn't take any bullshit.

1:29:01.659 --> 1:29:03.095
Have any ideas?

1:29:03.127 --> 1:29:06.565
Well, I might have some
salary requirements.

1:29:07.632 --> 1:29:09.234
Talk to the boss.

1:29:24.283 --> 1:29:25.952
We should sell our house.

1:29:28.086 --> 1:29:29.989
Don't I get a say in this?

1:29:31.590 --> 1:29:34.193
Well, I've been thinking.

1:29:34.225 --> 1:29:36.661
You know, it could keep us
afloat for another year.

1:29:50.908 --> 1:29:55.113
When we bottle our wine,
we're gonna need a label.

1:29:55.146 --> 1:29:56.782
So what do you think of that?

1:29:58.250 --> 1:29:59.918
Oh.

1:30:02.287 --> 1:30:03.789
It's beautiful.

1:30:36.921 --> 1:30:38.990
May people drink this wine,

1:30:39.024 --> 1:30:42.328
and continue to smile
long after we're gone.

1:30:42.360 --> 1:30:43.828
Salute.

1:30:43.862 --> 1:30:45.264
Salute.

1:30:45.296 --> 1:30:47.332
Salute!

1:30:48.800 --> 1:30:51.936
Salute!

1:30:51.970 --> 1:30:53.204
Cheers.

1:30:53.238 --> 1:30:54.740
- Mmm!
- Salute!

1:30:54.773 --> 1:30:56.708
Oh! Mwah!
