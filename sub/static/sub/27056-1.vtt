WEBVTT

00:39.914 --> 00:40.957
Ah!

01:04.898 --> 01:07.942
This is Dr. Agatha Matheson
of... of the Nightflyer.

01:08.735 --> 01:11.321
We have sustained fatalities,

01:11.404 --> 01:12.947
structural damages.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.657
-We...

02:16.970 --> 02:18.304
This is a warning...

02:19.931 --> 02:21.641
...not a distress call.

02:23.434 --> 02:24.894
Do not board this ship.

02:26.437 --> 02:29.524
Do not bring the Nightflyer back to Earth.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.432
Thank you.

03:12.609 --> 03:13.735
-Me again.

03:26.998 --> 03:29.208
No! No!

05:16.274 --> 05:17.275
Hold still.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.738
Any sickness - No.

05:29.245 --> 05:31.080
He's clear. Let him through.

05:31.456 --> 05:32.290
Thank you.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.800
...the spread
of the celio virus has caused

05:42.884 --> 05:44.594
the whole nation to submit...

05:45.553 --> 05:46.512
Joy?

05:46.763 --> 05:48.765
...from hearing
just the same lecture order

05:48.848 --> 05:52.060
in a more impressive strain
than we've all experienced 22 months ago.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.312
-Symptoms are tough as blocks,
-Hey.

05:54.395 --> 05:55.897
but all hospitals are preparing

05:55.980 --> 05:57.398
-for the worst.
-Hey, are they okay?

05:58.983 --> 06:00.485
Flights have been grounded.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.779
Quarantine zones are back into effect.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.489
They're... they're saying it might spread

06:04.572 --> 06:06.991
-to North this time.
-Yeah, but hey, we'll be all right.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.327
They've said that before.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.043
What is it?

06:19.337 --> 06:20.588
-The funding?

06:20.671 --> 06:21.881
-You got it?
-No.

06:22.882 --> 06:26.719
Presentation was horrible.
They practically threw tomatoes at me.

06:26.803 --> 06:27.970
-Oh.
-Mm.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.639
-Then, what?
-Afterwards,

06:30.556 --> 06:31.724
I got a call.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.267
From Roy Eris.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.062
And he's seen all my calculations.

06:36.145 --> 06:37.230
The intercept.

06:37.313 --> 06:38.272
The Teke waveforms.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.691
What... what does that have to do
with him building colonies?

06:40.775 --> 06:42.235
He sees the potential in all of this.

06:42.318 --> 06:44.487
He sees what I see, he...

06:44.570 --> 06:47.031
The power beyond our comprehension.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.116
All of it. He...

06:49.242 --> 06:50.910
He wants me to assemble a team.

06:51.869 --> 06:54.080
A team for... for what?

06:54.664 --> 06:57.667
Eris called me from the deck
of the Nightflyer.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.168
He wants to take me there.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.754
I'm going after the Volcryn.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.381
Um...

07:06.217 --> 07:07.176
I, um...

07:08.469 --> 07:11.097
That... that's incredible.

07:13.474 --> 07:16.310
Hey, um, I know how hard this is,

07:18.813 --> 07:20.982
but this is everything I've worked for.

07:21.774 --> 07:24.485
I'm happy for you.
It's... it's just it's...

07:25.236 --> 07:26.654
it's unexpected.

07:26.737 --> 07:30.116
This mission could change everything.

07:30.199 --> 07:32.368
It could save the earth.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.870
What do we tell her?

07:35.621 --> 07:37.623
You'll be... gone.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.542
Maybe two years.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.965
Joy, I'm sorry, but if I don't go,

07:46.716 --> 07:48.092
and they pass us by...

07:50.845 --> 07:52.054
I'm going to come back.

07:53.389 --> 07:54.390
Promise.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.143
I'm scared that you won't.

07:59.645 --> 08:00.646
Daddy?

08:01.481 --> 08:03.191
Hey, Honey.

08:03.691 --> 08:04.692
We wake you?

08:11.199 --> 08:12.366
I'm sorry.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.285
Want me to bring you back to bed?

08:14.368 --> 08:16.078
-Yeah.
-Okay. Come on.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.297
That thing you found in the sky,

08:27.048 --> 08:28.466
it's a ship for people?

08:29.217 --> 08:30.426
It might be.

08:32.303 --> 08:33.888
That's what I'm going to find out.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.810
And you're going to go talk to them?

08:41.938 --> 08:43.439
Yeah, I'm going to try to.

08:52.865 --> 08:53.699
Ah.

08:54.075 --> 08:54.909
Here.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.828
Give them...

08:59.080 --> 08:59.914
this.

09:00.998 --> 09:02.208
Friendship bracelet.

09:03.209 --> 09:04.710
So we can all be friends.

09:07.338 --> 09:09.048
I think they'd really like that.

09:13.177 --> 09:15.012
-Mm.

09:16.764 --> 09:18.224
Daddy

09:19.100 --> 09:20.560
-You're my...

09:21.060 --> 09:22.478
Memory paused.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.192
Go for D'Branin.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.152
Professor, the shuttle has arrived.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.988
And they are prepping the cargo
for off-load.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.240
How long until we break orbit?

09:34.323 --> 09:35.491
Six hours.

10:03.769 --> 10:04.979
You nervous?

10:06.939 --> 10:08.691
We're going into the void.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.234
No one's done that before.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.694
Eagle 16 did it.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.989
No one's done that and come back.

10:15.698 --> 10:18.326
Well, we're with Roy Eris.
I think we're in good hands.

10:34.967 --> 10:36.969
Hi, I'm Melantha Jhirl.

10:37.678 --> 10:39.513
-Karl's Mission Specialist.
-Sorry.

10:39.805 --> 10:42.725
Mel, Lommie, this is Dr. Matheson.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.143
Oh, Agatha is fine.

10:44.518 --> 10:46.812
I'm a psychiatrist.
I'll be looking after Thale.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.106
I'm excited to meet him.
I've never met an L-1 before.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.903
Mel and I planned every aspect
of this mission together.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.696
Karl was nervous
that a group of scientists

10:55.780 --> 10:57.448
wouldn't be able
to survive out in the void.

10:57.531 --> 11:00.326
But Mel has been born and raised
for space travel.

11:00.409 --> 11:02.286
So she will get us through it. Won't you?

11:02.495 --> 11:03.579
I'll do my best.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.790
Lommie. Thorne.

11:05.873 --> 11:06.999
It's nice to meet you.

11:08.417 --> 11:10.044
Lommie talks to the ship.

11:10.461 --> 11:13.214
Internal systems, data flow, coding.

11:13.547 --> 11:14.632
Neural port?

11:15.549 --> 11:16.384
Yeah.

11:17.134 --> 11:18.552
Wow.

11:21.097 --> 11:25.017
It's not much to look at,
but, uh, it's all they had.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.352
-No.
-It'll get the job done.

11:26.435 --> 11:27.937
-I think it's great.
-Ah.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.147
Most of them would rather
we weren't on the ship at all.

11:33.818 --> 11:34.693
Right.

11:35.444 --> 11:37.446
Got a special delivery coming in.

11:37.947 --> 11:41.242
I want full security on this one.
Quick and clean.

11:41.325 --> 11:42.535
Next bin holds an L-1.

11:42.618 --> 11:44.161
-A fucking L-1!
-Goddammit!

11:44.245 --> 11:45.663
Captain Eris wants him on this ship.

11:45.746 --> 11:47.748
So, we're bringing him
on this ship.

11:47.832 --> 11:48.999
Let's get this done.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.543
Gear up.

11:51.293 --> 11:53.712
Dr. Matheson,
do you really think your L-1

11:53.796 --> 11:55.131
can communicate with the Volcryn?

11:55.214 --> 11:56.173
Karl does.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.300
Yeah, I do.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.761
Look, the Teke energy
that comes off telepaths

12:00.845 --> 12:03.305
is the exact same energy
we detected coming off the Volcryn.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.059
So we better hope
they speak the same language.

12:07.143 --> 12:09.562
It's a theory,
but it's all we've got to go on.

12:12.690 --> 12:15.443
He's not my L-1, by the way.

12:15.734 --> 12:17.820
I've just known him since he was a child.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.155
What is he like?

12:19.655 --> 12:20.656
He's good.

12:21.699 --> 12:22.908
At times.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.118
Get ready.

12:25.244 --> 12:26.412
Be safe, you guys.

12:27.455 --> 12:28.539
Group of five.

12:30.458 --> 12:31.375
I'm ready.

12:31.459 --> 12:32.877
All right, here it comes.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.753
Get to position, follow my lead.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.714
-Come on.
-Yes, sir. Let's go, guys.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.935
You're doing the right thing.

13:32.686 --> 13:34.021
I hope you're right.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.574
I think he's waking up.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.493
He's under suppression.

13:49.495 --> 13:50.663
Open the pipe.

13:50.746 --> 13:51.914
Coming your way.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.113
The fuck was that?

14:24.196 --> 14:25.906
What the fuck was that?

14:25.990 --> 14:28.742
It was psychic feedback.
He wasn't trying to hurt you.

14:29.368 --> 14:32.663
Bad idea, bringing one of those things
onto this ship.

14:32.746 --> 14:34.331
Let's get him to the dome.

14:34.415 --> 14:35.249
Now.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.461
All right, moving.

14:43.716 --> 14:44.967
It's going to be okay.

14:45.634 --> 14:46.886
They can handle it.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.264
I, uh...

14:50.723 --> 14:51.891
wanna show you something.

14:53.225 --> 14:54.101
Come on.

15:17.833 --> 15:21.045
Everything you see
was grown right here on this ship.

15:23.464 --> 15:24.465
It's beautiful.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.886
I promised you
I'd look after Thale.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.849
Captain Eris has agreed
to give him two hours every week.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.142
Down there.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.272
Thale spent his entire life,

15:40.606 --> 15:42.608
locked inside that mountain.

15:42.816 --> 15:44.234
No fresh air.

15:45.402 --> 15:46.695
No sunshine.

15:48.739 --> 15:50.074
Thank you, Karl.

15:51.825 --> 15:53.994
This must be our lion tamer!

15:56.205 --> 15:59.583
I loved your paper
on neuroplasticity in telepaths.

16:00.876 --> 16:02.461
Wild stuff.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.755
This is Rowan, our xeno-biologist.

16:04.838 --> 16:07.257
-Oh. Nice to meet you.
-You too.

16:08.258 --> 16:09.760
Well, you must be thrilled,

16:09.843 --> 16:12.221
a chance to make first contact
with alien life.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.683
Is that what Karl told you we're doing?

16:16.266 --> 16:18.686
Yeah, Rowan is a little skeptical
of our mission.

16:18.769 --> 16:20.562
You don't believe
there's anything out there?

16:20.646 --> 16:22.272
Actually, I do.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.441
It's what concerns me.

16:25.192 --> 16:26.735
Don't let Rowan rattle you.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.529
He thrives on chaos.

16:29.363 --> 16:30.364
Huh.

16:32.199 --> 16:33.242
Oh, look.

16:34.034 --> 16:35.035
Sunset.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.038
How romantic.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.012
Is it true about the captain?

16:53.095 --> 16:55.097
That he never leaves his private deck?

16:55.681 --> 16:57.766
Captain Eris is a very private person.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.768
-You've met him though, right?
-Yeah.

16:59.852 --> 17:00.936
Yeah, sure. Sort of.

17:01.270 --> 17:02.104
Oi!

17:03.230 --> 17:04.398
Is it true?

17:05.357 --> 17:06.942
You brought an L-1 on board?

17:08.402 --> 17:10.487
Yeah, his name is Thale,

17:10.571 --> 17:12.364
and he's vital to the success
of this mission.

17:12.448 --> 17:13.407
He's an L-1, all right?

17:13.490 --> 17:15.617
-They're murderers.
-Murphy, come on. Not now!

17:15.701 --> 17:17.870
-Don't do this.
-We didn't sign up for this! All right?

17:17.953 --> 17:19.621
We ain't safe with that thing on board.

17:19.705 --> 17:20.706
He's not a thing.

17:21.623 --> 17:22.833
He's a person.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.501
-An L-1?
-A kid.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.920
Tell that to the families of Luna 71.

17:27.004 --> 17:28.630
Okay, look. You're afraid.

17:28.922 --> 17:29.965
I get it.

17:30.632 --> 17:32.259
You don't think I'm afraid, too?

17:32.342 --> 17:34.344
But we need Thale.

17:34.428 --> 17:37.097
When we get out there, we don't know
what the Volcryn are going to do.

17:37.181 --> 17:39.892
And Thale might be our only way
of communicating with them.

17:39.975 --> 17:41.477
A fucking L-1?

17:44.563 --> 17:46.190
Look, our planet is dying.

17:46.732 --> 17:49.485
Isn't that... that's why you're all
on a colony ship?

17:49.568 --> 17:50.778
Why you're all here?

17:51.945 --> 17:53.322
And look, the Volcryn,

17:53.405 --> 17:55.365
they've harnessed an energy

17:55.449 --> 17:58.786
that is vastly superior to anything
that we can possibly imagine.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.579
But we don't understand it.

18:00.871 --> 18:03.457
Now, if we can make contact
with them,

18:03.540 --> 18:05.125
and they can help us understand it,

18:05.751 --> 18:06.835
then maybe,

18:07.878 --> 18:09.588
maybe we can save our home.

18:10.130 --> 18:11.340
Save our families.

18:11.423 --> 18:15.094
But they're passing us by
and the Nightflyer is our one chance,

18:15.177 --> 18:17.554
-our only chance to make contact
-Anyone...

18:17.638 --> 18:19.932
-before they're out of reach.
-...is free to disembark

18:20.015 --> 18:22.309
-before we break orbit.
-Unless that L-1 kills us first.

18:22.851 --> 18:25.813
Anyone not fully dedicated to this mission
is free to disembark

18:25.896 --> 18:28.315
before we break orbit at 1400 hours.

18:28.690 --> 18:30.317
Captain Eris has just informed me

18:30.400 --> 18:33.362
that cowards' contracts
will be honored in full.

18:34.696 --> 18:35.781
Let's finish up.

18:36.448 --> 18:37.491
And get to work.

18:37.574 --> 18:38.617
Let's go, Murphy.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.539
That's a lovely speech.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.750
All clear. All clear.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.460
We have clean release for Shuttle 7.

18:48.585 --> 18:50.254
Shuttle has detached.

18:50.337 --> 18:54.550
Repeat. Shuttle is on its way
and heading 9040.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.032
Jump seats.

19:20.742 --> 19:22.786
Unless you know
how to operate one of these.

19:23.745 --> 19:26.039
No. No, we don't.

19:26.874 --> 19:29.084
Guess he'll allow anyone
on his bridge now.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.283
Why is he just a projection?

20:02.242 --> 20:04.578
Well, that's one
of life's great mysteries.

20:08.665 --> 20:09.833
This mission

20:11.251 --> 20:13.587
may change the course of human history.

20:15.339 --> 20:18.842
Professor D'Branin and his team
are the genesis of this pursuit.

20:19.259 --> 20:21.261
And guests on board this ship.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.432
Welcome,
on behalf of the Nightflyer.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.728
This journey, however,

20:30.646 --> 20:32.272
is much bigger than a ship,

20:33.523 --> 20:35.525
or Eris Corp, or...

20:36.193 --> 20:37.527
any of us.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.448
Never before has mankind
had the opportunity,

20:41.531 --> 20:44.910
and the means to make first contact.

20:46.703 --> 20:47.663
If we,

20:48.789 --> 20:49.706
all of us,

20:50.415 --> 20:52.042
can achieve that first,

20:54.169 --> 20:55.587
history will be written.

21:04.554 --> 21:06.306
Ready to break orbit, Augustine?

21:07.557 --> 21:08.892
Systems ready, sir.

21:09.810 --> 21:11.812
Sixty percent thrust, please.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.441
Okay, lady.

21:17.234 --> 21:18.235
Here we go.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.461
Waited for this my whole life.

21:54.354 --> 21:56.356
Malfunction Thruster four, standby.

21:56.940 --> 21:58.108
Is this normal?

21:58.191 --> 21:59.735
Getting error codes, Chief.

21:59.818 --> 22:02.738
Malfunction on Thruster two and three

22:02.821 --> 22:05.824
Misfire, Captain,
they are rolling us over!

22:11.455 --> 22:12.414
Murphy, report.

22:12.497 --> 22:14.166
Multiple errors, Captain.

22:14.249 --> 22:16.668
Bypass it now.
We need manual control.

22:16.752 --> 22:18.253
Misfire on one!

22:18.628 --> 22:20.088
I have no control!

22:20.464 --> 22:21.673
I've got this, Chief.

22:31.349 --> 22:33.351
We're approaching
the atmosphere, Captain.

22:33.643 --> 22:34.853
She's heating up!

22:38.106 --> 22:39.191
I've got this.

22:39.274 --> 22:40.942
Manual override engaged!

22:41.026 --> 22:42.277
-Come one!
-No!

22:43.653 --> 22:45.197
We need to break orbit.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.281
I'm on it, standby.

22:47.532 --> 22:48.575
No!

22:54.372 --> 22:55.582
Get us loose, Auggie!

22:56.750 --> 22:57.959
Hold on!

22:59.002 --> 22:59.920
Now!

23:42.921 --> 23:44.756
Well, who else could've messed
with the launch?

23:48.760 --> 23:50.178
-Piece of shit.

23:51.555 --> 23:52.556
Hey.

23:52.973 --> 23:53.974
Careful.

24:00.689 --> 24:01.523
You see him?

24:03.233 --> 24:04.693
-Can you see him?
-No, no, no.

24:07.654 --> 24:09.239
-Fucker.

24:11.199 --> 24:12.033
What is he doing?

24:12.117 --> 24:13.952
-What the fuck is that?
-I don't know.

24:18.248 --> 24:19.249
Standby.

24:29.551 --> 24:31.303
The fucker hung himself.

24:32.095 --> 24:32.929
Huh?

24:33.430 --> 24:34.598
He hung himself.

24:47.360 --> 24:48.320
-Boo!

24:52.449 --> 24:53.533
Doryen?

25:01.833 --> 25:04.252
You two are a sneaky bunch,
didn't you know that?

25:04.336 --> 25:05.545
That's naughty.

25:05.629 --> 25:09.341
Oh, you, uh, you come to check up on me
after the, uh, the bumpy start, have you?

25:09.424 --> 25:11.301
-That's very nice.
-You fucking animal!

25:11.384 --> 25:13.720
-Thank you very much.
-Fucking animal!

25:14.262 --> 25:15.889
You fucking animal!

25:15.972 --> 25:17.641
Oi, oi, oi! Where are you going?

25:17.724 --> 25:18.558
Oi, come back!

25:18.642 --> 25:20.727
I've got a candlelit dinner
for three laid out in here.

25:20.810 --> 25:21.645
Well...

25:22.103 --> 25:23.563
four, really.

25:24.439 --> 25:25.941
Hold on, I know you.

25:26.233 --> 25:28.735
You're the one that likes to wear
their mommy's panties, isn't it?

25:28.818 --> 25:30.445
I've seen it. It was very nice.

25:30.528 --> 25:33.198
I thought they suited you, personally.
It was a good look for you.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.075
This isn't over.

25:35.158 --> 25:37.160
Come on, then, bruv.
I'm fucking standing right here.

25:37.244 --> 25:38.662
Come on, then, bruv, come on, then!

25:44.584 --> 25:46.878
So Murphy's in stable condition
and in Re-Gen.

25:46.962 --> 25:48.421
This had nothing to do with Thale.

25:48.838 --> 25:52.509
-He can't cause a mechanical malfunction.
-I know that. But the crew doesn't.

25:52.592 --> 25:53.927
But, maybe it was one of the crew.

25:54.010 --> 25:56.680
You know, trying to frame him.
Get him kicked off the ship.

25:56.763 --> 25:59.683
Well, that's why you need to talk to him,
get all the information we can.

26:04.646 --> 26:06.147
You best get control of that thing.

26:17.951 --> 26:18.952
I'll handle this.

26:19.828 --> 26:20.829
You sure?

26:21.454 --> 26:22.455
Yeah.

26:22.956 --> 26:23.957
Okay.

26:55.322 --> 26:56.990
Thale, dammit. Stop that.

27:03.747 --> 27:05.081
Morning, Agatha.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.042
You look nice.

27:07.125 --> 27:09.878
You're being immature.
Those images are private.

27:10.462 --> 27:11.463
Mine.

27:11.838 --> 27:13.757
-I like it when you share.

27:14.215 --> 27:16.301
Sharing indicates
I gave you permission.

27:26.102 --> 27:27.395
You know, I like the air here.

27:28.188 --> 27:29.522
It's cleaner than back at home.

27:31.107 --> 27:33.109
-When can I go out in the garden?
-In time.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.446
There was a malfunction during the launch.

27:37.030 --> 27:39.074
They seem to think
that it wasn't an accident.

27:39.574 --> 27:41.576
That someone on board might be behind it.

27:42.410 --> 27:44.412
Did you see any flashes?

27:45.080 --> 27:46.039
Any images?

27:46.122 --> 27:46.998
Hm?

27:47.415 --> 27:48.416
Flashes?

27:48.917 --> 27:50.001
Images?

27:51.002 --> 27:52.003
I don't know.

27:53.171 --> 27:55.173
You let me watch you
in the shower, if I did?

27:55.256 --> 27:56.883
This isn't a game, Thale.

27:57.634 --> 27:59.177
A man was very badly hurt.

28:00.011 --> 28:01.096
Yeah.

28:02.222 --> 28:03.681
That's not why you're here, is it?

28:04.933 --> 28:06.684
Ah, you want to know if it was me.

28:26.746 --> 28:28.581
Peekaboo.

28:46.516 --> 28:47.517
Jesus.

28:50.228 --> 28:51.980
Something's different there.

28:52.272 --> 28:55.900
Ah! You changed the dose, didn't you?

28:59.696 --> 29:01.448
Trust is a two-way street.

29:22.093 --> 29:24.888
I can't find any source
for the malfunction during launch.

29:24.971 --> 29:27.223
That's not good enough.
We need to prove it wasn't Thale.

29:27.307 --> 29:28.183
What if it was?

29:28.266 --> 29:30.059
L-1s can't penetrate systems and machines.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.519
Found something else.

29:31.603 --> 29:32.937
Here's our current trajectory.

29:33.980 --> 29:36.733
And here is the Volcryn ship.

29:37.066 --> 29:38.276
They shifted course.

29:38.359 --> 29:40.236
Yes. Further into the void.

29:41.070 --> 29:42.906
What's the result to our mission time?

29:44.115 --> 29:46.075
At least five extra months.

29:46.826 --> 29:47.869
All of it deep in the void.

29:47.952 --> 29:50.371
No, run the calculations.
I need a precise intercept.

29:50.455 --> 29:52.624
And when you're done,
I need you to wipe the data.

30:00.423 --> 30:01.424
What's wrong?

30:03.092 --> 30:04.093
You seem...

30:04.677 --> 30:05.678
off.

30:07.263 --> 30:09.474
There's some problems on board.

30:10.683 --> 30:11.518
Telepath.

30:12.727 --> 30:14.145
You knew it was a risk.

30:14.979 --> 30:16.314
Yeah, it's going to be okay.

30:16.731 --> 30:18.483
Agatha's got a handle on it,
it will be fine.

30:21.903 --> 30:23.279
Of course, she does.

30:29.327 --> 30:30.870
I've been thinking about Skye a lot.

30:32.205 --> 30:33.206
I really miss her.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.085
She would be proud of you.

30:41.172 --> 30:42.173
Just like me.

30:43.675 --> 30:46.135
It's really hard to think of you
in that house alone.

30:46.219 --> 30:47.136
I'm not alone.

30:52.267 --> 30:53.560
I know you're up there,

30:54.727 --> 30:55.728
looking down on me.

30:57.188 --> 30:58.022
Karl.

31:01.234 --> 31:02.443
I love you.

31:44.777 --> 31:47.280
Try and catch me!

32:29.697 --> 32:30.865
What did you get from Thale?

32:31.449 --> 32:33.159
I'm just looking at these sketches.

32:33.242 --> 32:35.536
I don't see anything relating
to Murphy's accident.

32:37.997 --> 32:39.499
No wonder the crew's afraid of him.

32:40.249 --> 32:41.542
He draws what he sees.

32:42.210 --> 32:44.587
Those images come
from the people on this ship.

32:44.671 --> 32:46.255
The ones calling him a monster.

32:51.135 --> 32:53.888
-Do you know who that is?
-Yup, my daughter, Skye.

32:55.932 --> 32:59.268
I think Thale is making me see things,
hear things on the ship.

33:00.687 --> 33:04.315
Well, very powerful L-1s can do that,
but not under suppression.

33:04.524 --> 33:07.568
Okay, because I'm seeing things.
Heard a voice.

33:09.153 --> 33:10.363
What are you suggesting?

33:11.239 --> 33:13.574
Just wondering if you really have
your patient under control?

33:53.823 --> 33:54.991
Captain Eris?

33:56.200 --> 33:57.702
I know you're watching me.

33:58.536 --> 33:59.412
Where are you?

34:00.204 --> 34:01.330
Where I always am.

34:02.206 --> 34:03.541
Somewhere below your feet.

34:05.209 --> 34:06.419
Do you watch everyone?

34:07.837 --> 34:09.839
I don't find everyone fascinating.

34:29.525 --> 34:32.070
We've never had a cadet
from the genetic program on board.

34:32.153 --> 34:34.322
A lot of people
have been enhanced, Captain.

34:34.405 --> 34:36.783
I'm sure some of your crew
have had gene modifications.

34:36.866 --> 34:39.660
Oh, enhancement is not the same
as engineering.

34:39.744 --> 34:43.748
You, Melantha, were genetically designed
for space travel from birth.

34:43.831 --> 34:44.957
Tell me something.

34:45.041 --> 34:49.378
What if you went through all that training
only to end up hating being in space?

34:49.462 --> 34:51.923
I guess I'd be miserable,
like the rest of them down there.

34:52.006 --> 34:54.217
Are most people unhappy on Earth?

34:54.300 --> 34:55.343
You've never been?

34:55.426 --> 34:57.345
The Nightflyer suits my needs just fine.

34:58.221 --> 34:59.138
Of course, it does.

34:59.847 --> 35:02.975
Plenty of captive targets
for you to watch.

35:03.851 --> 35:04.936
You tell me something.

35:05.436 --> 35:06.646
Where else do you watch me?

35:08.731 --> 35:09.899
When I'm sleeping?

35:13.569 --> 35:14.570
Maybe...

35:15.738 --> 35:16.948
when I'm in the shower?

35:18.074 --> 35:19.200
I'm not looking for that.

35:20.618 --> 35:22.912
I can see flesh anytime I want.

35:24.372 --> 35:25.373
But intimacy,

35:26.415 --> 35:27.250
truth,

35:28.584 --> 35:30.378
a glimpse of someone's soul.

35:33.881 --> 35:35.299
Is that why you watch me?

35:41.973 --> 35:43.057
Captain Eris?

35:45.017 --> 35:45.977
You still here?

35:57.780 --> 35:58.990
Entre.

35:59.907 --> 36:01.784
Hey, Rowan, you got a minute?

36:01.868 --> 36:03.119
A million of them.

36:03.786 --> 36:05.788
Okay, good.
So, uh, we have a problem.

36:06.289 --> 36:07.165
Agatha.

36:07.707 --> 36:09.500
I'm beginning to doubt
that she has the ability

36:09.584 --> 36:10.793
to keep Thale contained.

36:11.294 --> 36:12.128
Hmm.

36:14.964 --> 36:16.465
That's controversial.

36:16.549 --> 36:18.718
What happens if we lose Thale?

36:18.801 --> 36:19.969
Well, you know how I feel.

36:21.387 --> 36:23.222
I'm merely one
of the hundred million people

36:23.306 --> 36:26.601
who think this mission
that you've concocted

36:26.684 --> 36:31.606
isn't exactly the wisest move
for our species.

36:32.523 --> 36:35.693
Yeah, that's exactly why I'm asking you
for your annoying opinion.

36:35.776 --> 36:38.070
We've been bombarding them for years

36:38.154 --> 36:40.364
with radio and light waves

36:40.448 --> 36:42.491
in every language we know,

36:42.575 --> 36:45.203
every formula that's ever been devised.

36:45.578 --> 36:46.787
What have we got back?

36:47.747 --> 36:48.873
Nothing.

36:48.956 --> 36:50.958
I doubt they're having trouble
understanding us.

36:52.668 --> 36:54.003
Most likely scenario is...

36:55.671 --> 36:57.924
-they don't want to talk.
-Rowan, what's your point?

36:58.007 --> 37:02.303
My point is that any beings
that intelligent

37:03.971 --> 37:05.890
would see the human race for what we are.

37:07.850 --> 37:09.268
We're a virus.

37:09.352 --> 37:11.145
That has killed its host

37:11.229 --> 37:13.773
and is looking for a new host to infect.

37:14.398 --> 37:18.069
That is an incredibly pessimistic view
of humankind.

37:18.152 --> 37:19.070
Realistic.

37:19.862 --> 37:20.863
Look at Earth,

37:21.447 --> 37:22.782
through a biological prism.

37:24.325 --> 37:26.494
We are the disease.

37:26.577 --> 37:27.912
If we lose Thale,

37:28.871 --> 37:31.499
can we still communicate
with the Volcryn or not?

37:31.582 --> 37:33.167
What's the point?

37:33.251 --> 37:35.169
They're probably going to exterminate us.

37:39.340 --> 37:41.050
If you think we're so doomed,

37:41.759 --> 37:43.469
why have you agreed
to come on this mission?

37:43.970 --> 37:48.182
Well, I spent my entire life wondering
what form alien life might take.

37:50.017 --> 37:51.352
I want to see what they look like.

38:01.195 --> 38:02.905
Error. Tank malfunction

38:08.077 --> 38:09.704
Error. Tank malfunction.

38:10.538 --> 38:12.248
Oxygen, 40 percent.

38:13.958 --> 38:15.960
Oxygen, 30 percent.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.131
Oxygen, 15 percent.

38:21.590 --> 38:23.467
Oxygen, ten percent.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.450
Warning.
Oxygen level critical.

38:52.621 --> 38:54.957
Warning.
Oxygen level critical.

38:57.043 --> 38:59.420
Warning. Oxygen depleted.

39:00.755 --> 39:03.049
Warning. Oxygen depleted.

39:53.766 --> 39:55.101
System override.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.186
-Emergency drain sequence initiated.
-Mel!

40:01.565 --> 40:03.567
Mel!

40:04.276 --> 40:05.945
Mel!

40:07.113 --> 40:08.114
Up.

40:49.530 --> 40:50.364
The ground,

40:52.700 --> 40:53.701
it's cold.

40:56.454 --> 40:57.955
-I like it.

40:59.457 --> 41:00.875
Can you smell the fennel?

41:03.043 --> 41:05.838
-It's kind of a licorice smell.

41:08.048 --> 41:09.341
They have voices.

41:10.092 --> 41:10.926
Who?

41:12.261 --> 41:13.262
Trees.

41:14.513 --> 41:15.514
Plants.

41:15.931 --> 41:18.142
Those bees over there.

41:18.225 --> 41:21.103
You know, Captain Eris
and his crew,

41:21.979 --> 41:23.147
they're worried.

41:25.941 --> 41:26.859
So are you.

41:30.905 --> 41:34.742
"Can't trust the psychic kid.
He's unsafe. He's unstable."

41:35.826 --> 41:38.078
Same shit they said
when they took me away from my family.

41:38.162 --> 41:40.998
-Thale, I know--
-No! L-1s are treated like shit.

41:42.791 --> 41:44.919
You know, we can do so much more
if they just...

41:46.253 --> 41:47.087
Mm.

41:47.671 --> 41:49.798
I need you to tell me the truth
about something.

41:51.675 --> 41:54.303
Have you been putting thoughts
in Dr. D'Branin's head?

41:55.387 --> 41:56.847
You mean that little girl?

41:56.931 --> 41:59.558
-That's his daughter, Thale.
-Was his daughter. She's dead.

42:00.643 --> 42:02.061
And no, I didn't.

42:02.770 --> 42:03.604
Agatha.

42:07.274 --> 42:08.108
Karl?

42:08.651 --> 42:09.568
I need Thale.

42:10.110 --> 42:11.403
Captain Eris wants to see him.

42:12.029 --> 42:13.155
We just want to talk to you.

42:14.198 --> 42:15.324
No, you don't.

42:16.700 --> 42:19.119
They want to put me to sleep
and they want to keep me asleep.

42:22.331 --> 42:23.707
There was another accident.

42:23.791 --> 42:25.042
Mel was nearly killed.

42:25.709 --> 42:26.794
Mm.

42:26.877 --> 42:28.921
-Are you going to tell them to back off?
-Look.

42:29.296 --> 42:31.173
We just want to talk to you.

42:31.840 --> 42:32.841
That's bullshit.

42:50.192 --> 42:51.193
Thale.

42:52.778 --> 42:54.238
Agatha, tell him to stop.

42:54.321 --> 42:55.656
Tell them to back down.

43:23.559 --> 43:24.643
Thale!

43:26.520 --> 43:27.938
Don't do this, Thale.

43:29.815 --> 43:30.899
-Thale!

44:00.346 --> 44:02.181
You understand why we had to do this?

44:04.224 --> 44:05.225
Where are you?

44:07.853 --> 44:09.438
I can't feel your thoughts.

44:10.439 --> 44:11.565
I'm right here.

44:12.066 --> 44:12.900
With you.

44:12.983 --> 44:15.944
Thale, I can't keep you safe
if you don't tell me the truth.

44:16.820 --> 44:19.198
That's a bit rich, coming from you,
isn't it, sweetheart?

44:21.742 --> 44:24.536
Did you tell the good captain the truth
about our mission?

44:26.622 --> 44:28.707
Go on.

44:28.791 --> 44:30.542
Go on, tell him about the course shift.

44:31.794 --> 44:32.878
What's he talking about?

44:33.962 --> 44:36.882
We detected a change
in the alien ship's course.

44:36.965 --> 44:39.510
As did my Nav Team. Two days ago.

44:39.593 --> 44:42.012
I've already reprogrammed the ship
for the new intercept.

44:42.096 --> 44:43.138
What does that mean?

44:43.972 --> 44:44.973
Karl?

44:45.683 --> 44:47.935
-Five extra months in the void.
-No.

44:48.018 --> 44:49.186
No,

44:49.269 --> 44:50.771
-I can't do that.
-We're not going back

44:50.854 --> 44:51.939
without making contact!

44:52.022 --> 44:54.692
The Nightflyer can handle the journey.
The unknown is Thale.

44:54.775 --> 44:58.195
Well, listen. If I wanted to hurt
your little ship, you'd know about it.

44:58.278 --> 45:00.614
The only way to know for sure
is to take Thale offline,

45:00.697 --> 45:01.824
so I can run diagnostics.

45:01.907 --> 45:02.825
Offline?

45:02.908 --> 45:06.745
Suspend his brain function, completely,
or I will have him removed from my ship.

45:07.329 --> 45:08.247
Do it now.

45:12.501 --> 45:13.502
If we don't do this,

45:14.878 --> 45:15.879
the crew will kill him.

45:26.056 --> 45:26.932
No.

45:27.015 --> 45:28.350
I'm so sorry, Thale.

45:30.269 --> 45:31.103
Now?

45:32.354 --> 45:33.355
Go on.

46:29.453 --> 46:30.287
Hey.

46:34.458 --> 46:35.417
How are you?

46:39.421 --> 46:40.339
Come in.

47:01.735 --> 47:02.736
What did you see?

47:06.114 --> 47:07.115
I saw...

47:10.786 --> 47:11.787
something.

47:18.168 --> 47:19.294
Do you think it was Thale?

47:22.839 --> 47:23.674
I don't know.

47:23.757 --> 47:27.344
I mean, how could he get into the system?

47:28.303 --> 47:31.306
-L-1s don't, they don't engage with data--
-I know what they say.

47:33.308 --> 47:35.269
But he could've gotten
inside your head, too.

47:38.814 --> 47:41.233
Yeah. I don't know. Maybe.

47:51.952 --> 47:53.579
I've never felt that before.

47:55.163 --> 47:56.164
What?

48:03.714 --> 48:04.798
Helpless.

48:12.389 --> 48:13.390
You saved my life.

48:21.940 --> 48:22.774
Um...

48:24.276 --> 48:27.863
I'm sorry, I'm not very good at this.

48:45.005 --> 48:46.798
Help me to feel something else.

49:21.833 --> 49:24.336
D'Branin. Initiate memory playback.

49:33.637 --> 49:34.471
Daddy, look!

49:52.280 --> 49:53.615
Come on!

49:54.700 --> 49:56.451
Try and catch me.

50:07.087 --> 50:08.046
Stop memory playback.

50:08.880 --> 50:10.298
Can you find me?

50:11.466 --> 50:12.634
I see you!

50:13.844 --> 50:15.053
Peekaboo!

50:24.062 --> 50:25.981
Stop playback.
This is not how it happened.

50:26.064 --> 50:26.940
Daddy?

50:27.023 --> 50:28.942
Stop playback!
This is not how it happened!

50:29.234 --> 50:30.152
Daddy?

50:33.280 --> 50:34.281
Daddy?

50:44.875 --> 50:46.209
Daddy?

50:48.670 --> 50:49.671
Daddy?

50:57.179 --> 50:58.472
Daddy?

51:18.700 --> 51:21.203
You disobeyed a direct order
and didn't medicate him!

51:21.286 --> 51:22.329
It is not Thale.

51:22.412 --> 51:23.997
He's using my memories against me!

51:24.080 --> 51:26.750
-Do you hear yourself? You're paranoid.
-And you're blind.

51:26.833 --> 51:29.252
What is it with you
and this... this L-1 kid?

51:29.336 --> 51:30.504
There's the Karl I remember.

51:30.587 --> 51:32.881
No, no, this isn't about us,
this is about the mission.

51:32.964 --> 51:34.925
No, you've always had a problem
with my work.

51:35.717 --> 51:37.594
Your work is why you're here.

51:38.303 --> 51:39.846
Then I'm asking you to trust me.

51:40.514 --> 51:41.973
I need you to trust me.

51:43.183 --> 51:44.684
Thale is unconscious.

51:45.811 --> 51:46.645
Show me.

51:49.815 --> 51:51.107
Someone's been here.

51:53.652 --> 51:54.653
Thale?

51:56.071 --> 51:58.698
I checked on him less than an hour ago.
He was right here.

51:58.782 --> 52:00.492
-Out cold.
-How could he just wake up?

52:00.575 --> 52:03.578
Well, someone would have to turn off
his medication, unlock the door.

52:03.662 --> 52:05.705
Well, I doubt any of Eris' crew
is going to do that.

52:05.789 --> 52:07.207
He's scared, Karl.

52:07.290 --> 52:09.167
L-1s hurt people
when they feel threatened.

52:09.251 --> 52:11.753
You should get to your quarters.
A search of the ship is underway.

52:11.837 --> 52:14.005
So, you've got cameras everywhere,
how is this possible?

52:14.089 --> 52:16.258
My vid-feeds are dark.
Someone breached the system.

52:16.341 --> 52:17.676
Well, that wasn't Thale.

52:17.759 --> 52:19.886
He can't turn off cameras
and unlock doors.

52:19.970 --> 52:23.390
My security team will find him
and take the appropriate action.

52:23.473 --> 52:24.891
He will know you're coming.

52:25.225 --> 52:26.268
If you corner him,

52:27.060 --> 52:28.770
your crew will walk into a bloodbath.

52:33.400 --> 52:36.027
Please proceed
to your assigned stations.

52:42.742 --> 52:44.744
Now, we have a bit of privacy.

52:45.078 --> 52:47.414
So, we need to find Thale
before Eris' men do.

52:47.497 --> 52:48.915
Can you access the ship's vid-feeds?

52:48.999 --> 52:50.625
Never been able to get past the firewalls.

52:50.709 --> 52:51.960
I need you to try harder.

52:52.043 --> 52:54.671
If Thale starts killing Eris' crew,
they're going to turn on us next.

52:54.754 --> 52:55.797
All right?

52:56.464 --> 52:57.465
I'm ready.

53:11.479 --> 53:13.189
Stand down! Stand down.

53:13.273 --> 53:14.441
Easy.

53:14.774 --> 53:16.234
Hey, Murph.

53:16.318 --> 53:18.028
Listen, you better get back
to your quarters.

53:18.111 --> 53:19.487
That L-1 is somewhere on the loose.

53:19.571 --> 53:21.615
I need to get down
to the access panel.

53:21.698 --> 53:23.533
Eris needs his feeds restored.

53:24.868 --> 53:26.161
Here. Take that.

53:26.870 --> 53:28.038
Just in case.

53:28.872 --> 53:30.373
Let's move. Come on.

53:49.976 --> 53:50.977
What's going on?

53:51.061 --> 53:53.438
-Okay, we need to take her out.
-No, no, no, you can't.

53:53.521 --> 53:56.191
If you disconnect the tether
while she's still inside, she'll be gone.

53:56.274 --> 53:57.859
Gone

53:58.902 --> 53:59.903
In there.

54:01.780 --> 54:02.614
Forever.

54:25.595 --> 54:27.097
Okay, somebody do something.

54:27.931 --> 54:29.849
Lommie Can you hear me

54:29.933 --> 54:30.934
Hey. Hey.

54:33.687 --> 54:34.521
Hey.

54:38.233 --> 54:39.317
Get out.

54:41.444 --> 54:43.905
Get out!

54:44.990 --> 54:47.409
Get out!

54:48.743 --> 54:50.745
Get out!

55:07.429 --> 55:08.304
Hey.

55:13.935 --> 55:15.103
What the fuck is that?

55:19.357 --> 55:20.275
Don't touch me.

55:20.608 --> 55:21.651
Lommie.

55:21.735 --> 55:22.777
Hey, Lommie.

55:23.069 --> 55:24.362
What did you see in there?

55:24.446 --> 55:25.280
Lommie?

55:25.363 --> 55:26.239
Lommie.

55:29.409 --> 55:30.577
Lommie!

55:40.670 --> 55:41.671
Bullocks.

56:22.587 --> 56:23.922
You fucking little freak.

56:26.758 --> 56:27.759
Lommie!

56:29.052 --> 56:29.886
Lommie!

56:52.742 --> 56:55.203
Error. Firewall breached.

56:56.788 --> 56:57.789
Lommie!

57:09.884 --> 57:11.094
Hey! Hey!

57:11.636 --> 57:12.720
Here you go!
