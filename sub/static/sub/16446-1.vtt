00:00.893 --> 00:03.828
- <i>Previously on</i> Lucifer...
- LINDA: <i>So, you're the Devil</i>

00:03.828 --> 00:05.330
and you've left Hell behind

00:05.332 --> 00:07.955
to take a vacation in Los Angeles.

00:07.957 --> 00:09.089
Well, where else would I go?

00:09.233 --> 00:10.600
Your return to the Underworld

00:10.602 --> 00:11.999
has been requested.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.049
Remind Dad that I quit Hell
because I was sick and tired

00:15.050 --> 00:16.432
of playing a part in his play.

00:16.456 --> 00:17.177
CHLOE: <i>I got it.</i>

00:17.178 --> 00:18.743
The name, the whole Lucifer thing,

00:18.791 --> 00:20.192
and desire's like your superpower.

00:20.259 --> 00:21.676
More like a gift from God, really.

00:21.677 --> 00:23.148
Why don't I affect you, Detective?

00:23.149 --> 00:24.696
I guess we both have our mysteries.

00:24.764 --> 00:26.613
MAZE: <i>Chloe Decker is
causing your vulnerability.</i>

00:26.614 --> 00:27.332
I'm bleeding.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.201
AMENADIEL: <i>I've been
sleeping with a demon.</i>

00:29.268 --> 00:30.628
I'm ready to turn myself in.

00:30.629 --> 00:32.697
DAN: <i>I removed a firearm
from evidence lockup.</i>

00:34.607 --> 00:35.640
LUCIFER: <i>Dad.</i>

00:35.708 --> 00:37.275
<i>I'll be the son</i>

00:37.343 --> 00:40.178
<i>that you always wanted me to be.</i>

00:40.246 --> 00:41.913
<i>This is impossible.</i>

00:41.981 --> 00:42.914
(gasps)

00:42.982 --> 00:44.015
Where's Maze?

00:44.083 --> 00:45.851
I was gonna ask you the same question.

00:45.918 --> 00:46.918
What does Father want?

00:46.986 --> 00:48.120
Someone's escaped from Hell.

00:48.187 --> 00:49.855
Who escaped Hell?

00:49.922 --> 00:51.546
Mum.

00:52.592 --> 00:54.025
♪ Money ♪

00:56.462 --> 00:59.998
♪ And fancy clothes ♪

01:03.202 --> 01:05.437
♪ Money ♪

01:07.240 --> 01:09.074

01:09.142 --> 01:11.877
MAN: Everybody, get the
hell on the ground!

01:11.944 --> 01:14.079
(alarm ringing)

01:19.085 --> 01:20.285
Fill the bag with everything

01:20.353 --> 01:21.620
on display.

01:21.687 --> 01:22.754
Hurry up!

01:22.822 --> 01:24.122
(grunting)

01:24.190 --> 01:26.391
This is such a cliché.

01:26.459 --> 01:28.326
I mean, for one,

01:28.394 --> 01:29.728
those are all conflict diamonds.

01:29.795 --> 01:30.795
Terrible karma,

01:30.863 --> 01:32.330
but more importantly,

01:32.398 --> 01:34.933
is this really how you want
to spend your time on Earth?

01:35.001 --> 01:36.401
I don't know who you are,

01:36.469 --> 01:38.637
but if you don't step
back, I will kill you.

01:38.704 --> 01:39.671
(chuckles)

01:39.739 --> 01:40.805
But that's not what

01:40.873 --> 01:42.274
you really desire, is it?

01:45.077 --> 01:46.244
No, it isn't.

01:46.312 --> 01:48.513
So, what do you want?

01:49.615 --> 01:50.916
Freedom.

01:50.983 --> 01:52.150
LUCIFER: Oh...

01:52.218 --> 01:53.733
just as I suspected.

01:53.734 --> 01:55.864
You were tired of being
a prisoner, weren't you?

01:55.888 --> 01:57.656
Yeah, that's right.

01:57.723 --> 01:58.963
I-I-I couldn't take it anymore.

01:58.991 --> 02:01.493
So you wanted to break your
shackles, be reborn.

02:01.561 --> 02:02.460
I did.

02:02.528 --> 02:03.328
So you escaped Hell,

02:03.362 --> 02:04.586
looking for an empty body,

02:04.587 --> 02:05.730
and found this poor sod,

02:05.798 --> 02:07.506
who'd just died of a heart attack,

02:07.507 --> 02:09.901
and now here you are, wreaking
havoc on Earth.

02:09.969 --> 02:11.770
The jig is up.

02:11.837 --> 02:14.105
We found you, Mum.

02:14.173 --> 02:16.174
Wait, what?

02:16.242 --> 02:18.410
You just said you
wanted to escape your shackles.

02:18.477 --> 02:19.511
Yeah.

02:19.579 --> 02:21.613
When the paramedics brought me back,

02:21.681 --> 02:23.381
I realized I needed to be free.

02:23.449 --> 02:24.883
Yes, from Hell.

02:24.951 --> 02:26.518
No, man, from debt.

02:26.586 --> 02:28.086
I owe a ton of money.

02:28.154 --> 02:29.998
And this was gonna get
me out from underneath it.

02:30.022 --> 02:31.623
You know what, I'm sick of this.

02:31.691 --> 02:33.391
The two of you are...

02:33.807 --> 02:34.840
(sighs)

02:34.908 --> 02:35.875
It's not Mom.

02:35.943 --> 02:37.176
Oh, you think?

02:37.244 --> 02:38.288
AMENADIEL: Well, we had to check.

02:38.312 --> 02:39.912
She doesn't have a body.

02:39.980 --> 02:41.380
She must have entered a human form

02:41.448 --> 02:42.815
of someone who's recently died.

02:42.883 --> 02:44.460
Which means anyone who kicked the bucket

02:44.484 --> 02:45.762
whilst you were sleeping on the job.

02:45.786 --> 02:48.354
Luci, do you realize he's
the last one on our list?

02:49.256 --> 02:51.290
Well, you must have missed one.

02:51.358 --> 02:53.659
Or maybe she's not in Los Angeles.

02:53.727 --> 02:55.061
(laughing): No, she's here.

02:55.128 --> 02:56.996
I kept her prisoner for
thousands of years.

02:57.064 --> 02:57.997
She's coming for me.

02:58.065 --> 02:59.298
I know it.

02:59.366 --> 03:01.133
We just need to get to her first.

03:01.201 --> 03:02.668
(sighs)

03:02.736 --> 03:03.803
Are you coming?!

03:03.870 --> 03:05.705
In a moment.

03:05.772 --> 03:08.908
There's so much
punishment, so little time.

03:08.976 --> 03:10.843
(chuckles)

03:10.911 --> 03:13.779
...dead.

03:19.019 --> 03:19.952

03:20.020 --> 03:21.253
What's going on?

03:22.155 --> 03:24.423
(groans)

03:24.491 --> 03:25.891
LUCIFER: <i>My mum's gonna kill me.</i>

03:25.959 --> 03:28.227
And before you say
it, that's not a metaphor.

03:28.295 --> 03:29.962
She's literally going to kill me.

03:30.030 --> 03:31.273
She's not the forgiving type.

03:31.422 --> 03:33.966
You've never
mentioned your mother before.

03:34.034 --> 03:35.101
Why is that?

03:35.168 --> 03:37.870
Well, you wouldn't
understand, would you?

03:37.938 --> 03:39.705
I'd like to.

03:41.141 --> 03:43.175
Oh, all right.

03:43.243 --> 03:44.243
Very well.

03:44.311 --> 03:46.545
In human terms,

03:46.613 --> 03:50.016
once upon a time, a boy met a girl,

03:50.083 --> 03:52.018
and they fell in love.

03:52.085 --> 03:53.352
They had sex.

03:53.420 --> 03:54.822
The only trouble was,

03:54.824 --> 03:56.165
they were celestial beings,

03:56.189 --> 03:58.190
so that moment created the universe.

03:58.258 --> 03:59.692
Mm, the Big Bang?

03:59.760 --> 04:02.194
Never knew how appropriate the
name was until now, did you?

04:02.262 --> 04:03.929
Anyway, they became Mum and Dad.

04:03.997 --> 04:07.800
They had a whole litter of
kids, including yours truly.

04:07.868 --> 04:09.201
And they built a house.

04:09.269 --> 04:10.302
They called it Heaven.

04:10.370 --> 04:11.337
They were happy.

04:11.405 --> 04:13.205
Dad was...

04:13.273 --> 04:15.808
well, Dad, and Mum...

04:17.678 --> 04:21.647
Well, Mum was rather
lovely in the beginning.

04:21.714 --> 04:23.516
(sighs)

04:23.583 --> 04:24.917
But things change, don't they?

04:26.486 --> 04:27.853
Dad started going into the garage

04:27.921 --> 04:30.923
and tinkering with a
little project he called humanity.

04:32.359 --> 04:36.162
Mum grew cold... distant.

04:36.229 --> 04:37.496
(inhales deeply)

04:37.564 --> 04:39.799
And pretty soon, they were
both neglecting their family.

04:39.866 --> 04:42.868
And then one of his
children started to act out?

04:42.936 --> 04:43.969
Indeed.

04:44.037 --> 04:45.504
Yeah... so Dad got pissed off

04:45.572 --> 04:47.173
and tossed me out of the house.

04:47.240 --> 04:49.642
And what did your mother do?

04:49.743 --> 04:51.610
Nothing.

04:51.678 --> 04:54.747
She just stood there and let it happen.

04:56.583 --> 04:58.517
Anyway, a couple of
thousand years later,

04:58.585 --> 05:00.319
Dad kicked her out, too.

05:00.387 --> 05:03.322
Cast her into Hell and
put her in a cell.

05:03.390 --> 05:07.059
So, I did the same for
her as she did for me.

05:07.127 --> 05:08.761
Zilch.

05:10.263 --> 05:11.997
<i>Is it good to be back</i>

05:12.065 --> 05:13.365
on a studio set, Detective?

05:13.433 --> 05:14.400
CHLOE: Not really.

05:14.468 --> 05:15.701
(Lucifer chuckles)

05:15.769 --> 05:18.604
It's bringing back
memories of your acting days?

05:18.672 --> 05:19.792
If you're feeling nostalgic,

05:19.840 --> 05:22.611
sure I can find some
horny teenagers and a hot tub.

05:22.612 --> 05:24.821
'Cause the movie you were in was...

05:24.845 --> 05:25.678
Yeah, I got it.

05:25.746 --> 05:27.023
Is everything all right, Detective?

05:27.047 --> 05:28.293
You seem distracted.

05:28.294 --> 05:30.126
Usually I get at
least a glimmer of a smile

05:30.150 --> 05:31.117
from my remarks,

05:31.184 --> 05:32.318
the occasional eye roll.

05:32.385 --> 05:34.620
I think I got a snort once.

05:34.688 --> 05:36.388
Two days ago, you
were shot point-blank.

05:36.456 --> 05:38.290
Ah, well, no need to thank
me for my heroism.

05:38.358 --> 05:39.335
Well, maybe just a little.

05:39.359 --> 05:40.292
No one's stopping you.

05:40.360 --> 05:41.327
(chuckles)

05:41.394 --> 05:43.028
There was blood all over you.

05:43.096 --> 05:44.173
- You should be dead.
- Well,

05:44.197 --> 05:45.641
par for the course for our adventures,

05:45.665 --> 05:46.632
Detective. What's new?

05:46.700 --> 05:48.167
I have a sample of your blood

05:48.235 --> 05:49.579
and I'm gonna take it and test it.

05:49.603 --> 05:50.936
- Oh.
- And I'm gonna find out

05:51.004 --> 05:52.872
exactly what you are once and for all.

05:52.939 --> 05:53.873
- Yeah.
- Oh.

05:53.940 --> 05:54.840
The Devil himself?

05:54.908 --> 05:55.918
No, I'm guessing Larry Morningstar,

05:55.942 --> 05:57.382
the son of a plumber in Connecticut.

05:57.410 --> 05:59.512
Right, well, wrap that up, would you?

05:59.579 --> 06:01.180
'Cause I could use your help on my end.

06:01.248 --> 06:02.481
I'm on a bit of a manhunt.

06:02.549 --> 06:05.417
Well, womanhunt, and I
need to find her before...

06:08.855 --> 06:10.856
I'm too late.

06:23.159 --> 06:24.426
(sighs)

06:24.494 --> 06:26.261
So, our victim's name is Gillian Taylor.

06:26.329 --> 06:29.665
She was a stand-in for the
lead actress on Leave It to Leslie.

06:29.733 --> 06:30.833
Stand-in?

06:30.900 --> 06:32.901
Yeah, stand-ins are
used to light a scene

06:32.969 --> 06:33.969
as the actors prep.

06:34.037 --> 06:35.281
Usually want to be actors themselves.

06:35.305 --> 06:38.107
And now she's dead because of me.

06:38.174 --> 06:39.285
What do you mean, because of you?

06:39.309 --> 06:40.637
Well, remind you of anyone?

06:40.774 --> 06:42.544
That's weird.

06:42.612 --> 06:43.746
CHLOE: What's weird, Ella?

06:43.813 --> 06:45.514
Well...

06:45.582 --> 06:47.816
you'd think cause of death would be

06:47.884 --> 06:49.051
the giant chunks of metal

06:49.119 --> 06:51.120
sticking out of her head, but no,

06:51.187 --> 06:52.221
she was strangled. Look.

06:52.288 --> 06:53.566
You can see the contusions on her neck.

06:53.590 --> 06:55.124
So, the horns were added postmortem?

06:55.191 --> 06:58.494
Yeah, soft tissue at the
point of impact is yellow-pink.

06:58.561 --> 07:00.329
That means that
there was no blood pressure

07:00.397 --> 07:02.464
when our killer went all stabby-stab.

07:02.532 --> 07:03.298
And...

07:03.366 --> 07:05.768
she was killed somewhere else.

07:05.835 --> 07:07.202
This body was moved here.

07:07.270 --> 07:08.995
So, the killer is sending a message.

07:09.155 --> 07:10.549
Ah, good, so you agree with me.

07:10.573 --> 07:12.474
I didn't say the message was to you.

07:12.542 --> 07:13.753
Well, who else would it be for?

07:13.777 --> 07:15.744
(sighs)

07:15.812 --> 07:17.010
What the hell?

07:18.415 --> 07:21.083
Oh, joy of joys, I
thought Detective Douche

07:21.151 --> 07:22.117
was in jail.

07:22.185 --> 07:23.318
He's suspended.

07:23.386 --> 07:24.820
Or at least he was.

07:24.888 --> 07:26.488
Give us a minute.

07:26.556 --> 07:27.523
Hi.

07:27.590 --> 07:28.390
Hey.

07:28.458 --> 07:29.992
What are you doing here?

07:30.060 --> 07:31.727
I've been reinstated.

07:31.795 --> 07:32.795
What?

07:32.862 --> 07:35.030
After Malcolm and everything
that happened at Palmetto,

07:35.098 --> 07:36.409
they wanted to sweep
everything under the rug.

07:36.433 --> 07:37.966
And the only thing I confessed to was

07:38.034 --> 07:39.354
improperly checking out evidence.

07:39.402 --> 07:40.803
A gun that killed someone.

07:40.870 --> 07:42.104
I didn't ask for this.

07:42.172 --> 07:43.872
You didn't turn it down, either.

07:43.940 --> 07:45.084
Would you rather I go to jail?

07:45.108 --> 07:46.218
You think Trixie would prefer that?

07:46.242 --> 07:50.579
No, it's just... it's a lot to take in.

07:51.681 --> 07:53.949
(scoffs)

07:54.017 --> 07:55.617
I've been demoted.

07:55.685 --> 07:57.052
I've been reassigned

07:57.120 --> 07:59.988
to assist on cases, so...

08:00.056 --> 08:01.490
for now, how can I help?

08:01.558 --> 08:04.593
Uh, interview crew members.

08:04.661 --> 08:06.962
See if they know
anything, any enemies she had.

08:07.030 --> 08:08.197
I mean, you know.

08:08.264 --> 08:09.565
Thanks, Chloe.

08:09.632 --> 08:10.833
Yeah.

08:15.605 --> 08:17.172
You're a newbie, aren't you?

08:17.240 --> 08:18.974
Oh, hey, yeah.

08:19.042 --> 08:20.509
Ella Lopez.

08:20.577 --> 08:22.088
I just transferred in a couple days ago.

08:22.112 --> 08:24.880
You must be Detective
Decker's civilian consultant.

08:24.948 --> 08:26.715
Lucifer Morningstar.

08:26.783 --> 08:27.583
Cool.

08:28.651 --> 08:29.451
I was expecting

08:29.519 --> 08:31.120
a different reaction considering

08:31.187 --> 08:32.121
your choice of bling.

08:32.188 --> 08:33.121
Oh.

08:33.188 --> 08:34.923
Dude, I had a friend named Adolf.

08:34.991 --> 08:35.924
Okay, Adolf.

08:35.991 --> 08:37.102
I didn't hold it against him.

08:37.126 --> 08:38.537
- (chuckles)
- And besides, I think the Devil

08:38.561 --> 08:40.261
- gets a bad rap.
- Oh.

08:40.330 --> 08:41.697
- You do, do you?
- Sure.

08:41.764 --> 08:44.333
I mean, what did he
really do that was so bad?

08:44.400 --> 08:45.901
What, rebel against his dad?

08:45.969 --> 08:48.370
Ask some naked lady if
she wanted an apple?

08:48.438 --> 08:50.139
Be still my heart. Do go on.

08:50.206 --> 08:51.840
I suppose he does run Hell.

08:51.908 --> 08:54.276
That's not so great, you
know, with the torture

08:54.344 --> 08:55.577
and eternal damnation.

08:55.645 --> 08:56.612
I'm retired.

08:56.679 --> 08:57.723
And besides, I didn't create Hell.

08:57.747 --> 08:58.714
I just worked there.

08:58.781 --> 09:00.983
And now you're talking

09:01.050 --> 09:02.317
in the first person.

09:02.385 --> 09:03.385
Wait.

09:03.453 --> 09:05.287
- Are you...
- The Devil?

09:05.355 --> 09:06.955
- ...a method actor?
- What?

09:07.023 --> 09:08.891
(groans)

09:08.958 --> 09:10.626
(clamoring)

09:10.693 --> 09:13.929
Not exactly an Emmy-worthy performance

09:13.997 --> 09:15.063
from our child actor.

09:15.131 --> 09:16.698
LUCIFER: And her dick nozzle boyfriend.

09:16.766 --> 09:17.643
CHLOE: Weird, for a girl

09:17.667 --> 09:18.677
who normally doesn't wear mascara,

09:18.701 --> 09:20.169
she's certainly wearing a lot.

09:20.236 --> 09:21.670
I wonder why.

09:21.738 --> 09:22.671
Trixie loves her show.

09:22.739 --> 09:24.439
Oh, my God, me, too.

09:27.810 --> 09:30.145
LUCIFER: Sweet candy coating
on the outside,

09:30.213 --> 09:31.980
delicious evil on the inside?

09:32.048 --> 09:33.515
Or she just likes the attention.

09:33.583 --> 09:35.751
Either way, she's got a
wall of reps surrounding her.

09:35.818 --> 09:37.258
I've got a call in to interview her.

09:37.287 --> 09:39.488
But for now let's focus on Gillian.

09:39.556 --> 09:41.456
Yeah.

09:43.593 --> 09:47.196
Gillian rented from me for four years.

09:47.263 --> 09:49.565
Such a sweet, strong girl.

09:49.632 --> 09:52.701
You know, I... I don't
have a daughter, but, uh...

09:54.404 --> 09:57.072
You know, she got so
close on so many auditions.

09:57.140 --> 10:01.577
I... I really thought
that she was gonna break in.

10:05.181 --> 10:06.682
This is my fault.

10:06.749 --> 10:08.951
Why do you say that?

10:09.018 --> 10:10.752
WOMAN: Well, I work as a set nurse.

10:10.820 --> 10:11.987
I pulled a few strings.

10:12.055 --> 10:13.822
I got her that job.

10:13.890 --> 10:15.824
If she hadn't met Amy...

10:15.892 --> 10:17.192
Do you think Amy did this?

10:17.260 --> 10:20.028
No, sweet, darling, innocent Amy?

10:20.096 --> 10:22.998
Oh, I'm sensing
sarcasm and general loathing.

10:23.066 --> 10:25.000
Oh, that girl's a bad influence.

10:25.068 --> 10:27.569
She has so much cocaine up
her nose, it would snow

10:27.637 --> 10:29.448
- if you shook her.
- (chuckles) Yes, I've tried that.

10:29.472 --> 10:31.073
WOMAN: The show kept it out of the news.

10:31.140 --> 10:32.407
They even hid her O.D.

10:32.475 --> 10:33.675
a couple of days ago.

10:33.743 --> 10:35.911
Hospital was barely able
to start her heart again.

10:35.979 --> 10:37.179
Well, hold on.

10:37.247 --> 10:39.181
You're saying Amy
died, then came back to life,

10:39.249 --> 10:40.593
and then an innocent girl was found dead

10:40.617 --> 10:42.061
with devil horns shoved into her skull?

10:42.085 --> 10:44.386
I... guess that's

10:44.454 --> 10:45.554
one way to put it.

10:45.622 --> 10:46.855
Yes.

10:50.267 --> 10:53.003
Maybe Gillian wasn't as
innocent as she seemed.

10:55.272 --> 10:58.141
Well, maybe she needed the
cash to fund her flamingo army.

10:58.209 --> 11:00.343
We need to check on
Gillian's financials.

11:00.411 --> 11:03.513
See if she made any large cash
deposits and, if so, when.

11:03.581 --> 11:05.482
I don't know. Maybe
we can find a pattern.

11:05.549 --> 11:08.218
Well, it doesn't matter,
because I know who the killer is.

11:08.285 --> 11:10.654
Really? Who?

11:11.555 --> 11:13.390
My mum.

11:13.457 --> 11:14.924
Your mom?

11:14.992 --> 11:16.145
It's a long story, but I think

11:16.147 --> 11:19.295
my mum's soul is currently inside Amy.

11:19.363 --> 11:21.141
She's the perfect
choice of host body, really.

11:21.165 --> 11:23.299
Young, beautiful,
worshipped and adored by millions.

11:23.367 --> 11:25.201
You're making less
sense than you normally do.

11:25.269 --> 11:27.937
That's because you still
don't believe me!

11:28.005 --> 11:29.506
Just test my blood, Detective.

11:29.573 --> 11:31.241

a couple days ago as
they were setting up a shot.

13:30.094 --> 13:31.761
Unfortunately, they
weren't rolling audio.

13:31.829 --> 13:33.263
Well, I get the gist of it.

13:33.330 --> 13:36.366
Gillian had a bunch of

- You don't?

15:10.414 --> 15:11.916
What we care about is
that you and Gillian

15:11.918 --> 15:14.096
had an argument right
before she died. Why?

15:14.120 --> 15:15.353
- Does it matter?
- We found

15:15.421 --> 15:17.122
a lot of cash at Gillian's house,

15:17.189 --> 15:18.657
so if she was blackmailing you...

15:18.724 --> 15:19.891
She wasn't blackmailing me.

15:19.959 --> 15:22.193
She was my sober companion.

15:22.261 --> 15:24.329
Well, clearly not very
good at it. (chuckles)

15:24.397 --> 15:26.798
The production company
thought it was a good idea

15:26.866 --> 15:30.302
to hire my stand-in to
also keep an eye on me.

15:30.369 --> 15:32.203
They thought it would
help keep it a secret.

15:32.271 --> 15:34.172
- What was the fight about?
- I was getting

15:34.240 --> 15:36.341
tired of her treating me like a child.

15:36.409 --> 15:37.542
I'm an adult!

15:37.610 --> 15:39.210
I can make my own decisions.

15:39.278 --> 15:40.812
Clearly.

15:44.684 --> 15:47.185
I'd gotten a new supply in.

15:47.253 --> 15:49.721
She was trying to take it away from me.

15:50.623 --> 15:53.158
Oh.

15:58.064 --> 16:00.165
Just take-take it all away.

16:01.233 --> 16:03.201
LUCIFER: A devil emoji? That's it.

16:03.269 --> 16:05.070
I'm speaking to a
copyright lawyer today.

16:05.137 --> 16:07.172
CHLOE: So Gillian cut off your supply.

16:07.239 --> 16:09.207
That must have pissed
off your dealer. Who is he?

16:09.275 --> 16:10.575
I-I never met him.

16:10.643 --> 16:11.876
All I have is a number.

16:11.944 --> 16:13.912
I'd text him, he'd
messenger me the drugs.

16:13.980 --> 16:16.748
Okay, good. I'm gonna need that number.

16:16.816 --> 16:18.750
Okay. Thank you.

16:18.818 --> 16:21.820
Okay, so the production company

16:21.887 --> 16:24.456
confirms that they paid
Gillian under the table

16:24.523 --> 16:26.191
to be Amy's sober companion.

16:26.258 --> 16:27.178
That explains the cash.

16:27.226 --> 16:28.760
I mean, I'm not saying Amy's innocent,

16:28.828 --> 16:30.161
but I don't see a motive anymore.

16:30.229 --> 16:33.865
Well, what about our emoji-loving
drug dealer?

16:33.933 --> 16:35.053
Could be a show of strength.

screws with him in the future.

16:36.836 --> 16:40.405
I put a warrant in to
locate his cell phone, and, uh...

16:40.473 --> 16:41.544
What?

16:41.683 --> 16:43.452
Do you still think this is about you?

16:43.476 --> 16:45.443
Of course I do, but
it's worse than I thought.

16:45.511 --> 16:47.579
My mum is clearly playing the long game.

16:47.647 --> 16:50.582
Taunting me with my own distorted
image again and again.

16:50.650 --> 16:54.085
No, really. Do you really think
the drug dealer is your mother?

16:54.153 --> 16:56.621
Well, she's clever
enough to pull it all off.

16:56.689 --> 16:58.256
What? You thought I took after my dad?

16:58.324 --> 17:01.793
Oh. You don't have to
believe anything I say, Detective.

17:01.861 --> 17:04.029
Test my blood.

17:04.096 --> 17:07.332
Oh, dearie me, why are you hesitating?

17:07.400 --> 17:08.867
Scared to find out the truth?

17:08.934 --> 17:10.201
I'm not scared about anything

17:10.269 --> 17:12.737
other than finding
out what STDs you have.

17:12.805 --> 17:14.204
Very funny.

17:14.272 --> 17:16.207
(tires screeching)

17:20.512 --> 17:23.181
(indistinct radio transmission)

17:23.249 --> 17:25.183
Hey.

17:27.000 --> 17:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:46.706 --> 17:47.672
Hey!

17:47.740 --> 17:49.240
- How did...?
- What the hell

17:49.308 --> 17:50.875
are you doing in here?

17:50.943 --> 17:53.912
I'm sorry. I, uh...

17:53.979 --> 17:56.181
I must have gotten lost.

18:00.252 --> 18:03.221
(keys jingling)

18:03.289 --> 18:04.889
Good night.

18:06.592 --> 18:09.094
LINDA: <i>You don't think you
deserve any of the blame</i>

18:09.161 --> 18:10.628
<i>for what happened with your mother?</i>

18:10.696 --> 18:13.364
No. That's between her and Dad.

18:13.432 --> 18:14.499
Then whose fault is it?

18:14.567 --> 18:17.168
Well, I suppose none of
this would have happened

18:17.236 --> 18:19.204
if Amenadiel had been watching over Hell

18:19.271 --> 18:20.115
like he was supposed to.

18:20.139 --> 18:21.473
I thought that was your job.

18:21.540 --> 18:24.642
Well, it was, but when I
abdicated, it became his.

18:24.710 --> 18:26.778
Sort of like a game of hot potato.

18:26.846 --> 18:29.414
And then there's Maze.

18:29.482 --> 18:30.582
And what about her?

18:30.649 --> 18:31.783
Well, she's still missing.

18:31.851 --> 18:33.351
See, I'm-I'm worried she might

18:33.419 --> 18:35.053
be involved in all this.

18:35.121 --> 18:36.321
Might explain why Mum was able

18:36.388 --> 18:38.356
to hit the ground
running with my torment.

18:38.424 --> 18:39.457
And

18:39.525 --> 18:40.859
I wouldn't be in this mess

18:40.926 --> 18:41.970
if it wasn't for the detective,

18:41.994 --> 18:43.394
and she doesn't even know it!

18:43.462 --> 18:44.629
And why is that?

18:44.697 --> 18:47.899
Well, when I asked
Father for the favor, I...

18:47.967 --> 18:49.400
(chuckles softly)

18:49.468 --> 18:50.668
Look, it doesn't matter.

18:50.736 --> 18:52.414
Even if I told her, she
wouldn't believe me anyway.

18:52.438 --> 18:55.907
Sounds like there's a
lot of blame to go around.

18:55.975 --> 18:57.008
Yes.

18:57.076 --> 18:59.444
Is there anyone you
might be leaving out?

18:59.512 --> 19:01.446
(sighs) Anyone I'm leaving out.

19:01.514 --> 19:03.448
Um...

19:03.516 --> 19:05.450
(clock ticking)

19:05.518 --> 19:07.485
Oh, you're right.

19:07.553 --> 19:08.820
Yes.

19:08.888 --> 19:10.688
If you'd fixed my
existential problem earlier,

19:10.756 --> 19:12.033
none of this would have happened.

19:12.057 --> 19:15.160
Well, good on you for
taking responsibility, Doctor.

19:15.227 --> 19:17.428
It's very noble.

19:17.496 --> 19:19.430
Ah.

19:19.498 --> 19:21.633
(laughs)

19:23.202 --> 19:27.138
I worry you're not gaining
anything from our sessions.

19:27.206 --> 19:28.907
- What do you mean?
- Lately,

19:28.974 --> 19:31.176
you're using our sessions as an excuse

19:31.243 --> 19:34.212
to misinterpret what I
say for your own gain.

19:34.280 --> 19:35.880
(laughs) What?

19:35.948 --> 19:38.016
I don't think I'm actually helping you.

19:38.083 --> 19:39.617
Are you breaking up with me?

19:39.685 --> 19:41.152
I'm asking the question.

19:41.220 --> 19:43.721
Are our sessions actually helping,

19:43.789 --> 19:46.324
or just making things worse?

19:52.565 --> 19:54.899
Lucifer?

19:54.967 --> 19:57.769
You said you wanted to talk.

19:58.938 --> 20:01.072
Hello, Chloe.

20:02.441 --> 20:04.542
What's going on?

20:04.610 --> 20:08.179
I was really hoping I
wouldn't have to do this, but...

20:08.247 --> 20:10.915
recent developments have left
me with no other choice.

20:10.983 --> 20:12.784
No other choice than to what?

20:12.852 --> 20:14.819
You need to know the truth, Chloe.

20:14.887 --> 20:17.155
About Lucifer.

20:17.223 --> 20:19.257
All right.

20:19.325 --> 20:20.525
I'm listening.

20:20.593 --> 20:23.720
Oh, I'm not gonna tell
you. I'm gonna show you.

20:25.464 --> 20:27.265
What are you doing?

20:28.601 --> 20:31.785
Amenadiel. Amenadiel, no!

20:36.167 --> 20:40.041
(gasping)

20:40.065 --> 20:42.266
Okay, you're gonna be fine.

20:42.333 --> 20:44.401
I'm gonna call an
ambulance. You're gon...

20:44.469 --> 20:46.136
(sighs)

20:48.006 --> 20:49.940
You c...

20:50.008 --> 20:52.142
(panting)

20:53.378 --> 20:56.046
You're... you're okay.

20:56.114 --> 20:57.681
(panting)

20:57.749 --> 21:00.651
How?

21:00.718 --> 21:03.587
Okay, this is going to
be hard for you to hear,

21:03.655 --> 21:07.157
which is why I needed
you to see what Lucifer is.

21:08.462 --> 21:10.596
No.

21:10.664 --> 21:12.265
I don't believe it.

21:12.332 --> 21:14.267
Good.

21:14.334 --> 21:15.968
Because it's all a lie.

21:16.036 --> 21:18.671
Bulletproof vest and blood packs.

21:18.739 --> 21:20.773
Are you insane?

21:20.841 --> 21:22.675
You could have killed yourself!

21:22.743 --> 21:24.010
I was perfectly safe, Chloe.

21:24.077 --> 21:25.645
This, by the way, is what Lucifer wore

21:25.712 --> 21:27.023
when you guys confronted Malcolm.

21:27.047 --> 21:28.858
- How would you know that?
- Because I put it on him.

21:28.882 --> 21:30.483
He knew what he was walking into.

21:30.551 --> 21:34.954
Listen, everything that he
does is part of a performance.

21:36.356 --> 21:37.990
All right.

21:38.058 --> 21:40.326
Then what about the
weird mojo thing he does?

21:40.394 --> 21:41.861
Neural linguistic programming?

21:42.763 --> 21:44.130
The power of suggestion?

21:44.197 --> 21:46.332
Look, he studied it at a very young age.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.935
And I hate to admit this, but he's
actually really good at it.

21:49.002 --> 21:50.713
What about the fact that
you two are brothers?

21:50.737 --> 21:53.706
Come on. You've never heard of adoption?

21:54.908 --> 21:57.443
Why? Why would he do all this?

21:57.511 --> 21:58.888
Listen, what you have to understand

21:58.912 --> 22:01.514
is that my brother and I
had a very difficult childhood.

22:01.582 --> 22:03.215
And to deal with it, he created

22:03.283 --> 22:06.953
this persona for himself...
Lucifer Morningstar, the Devil,

22:07.020 --> 22:09.355
incorrigible and invincible.

22:09.423 --> 22:10.656
So he's a liar?

22:10.724 --> 22:12.325
Chloe, he means well,

22:12.392 --> 22:13.693
but in the end, the only person

22:13.760 --> 22:15.861
he ever truly lies to is himself.

22:16.797 --> 22:18.264
(phone ringing)

22:20.000 --> 22:20.933
Decker.

22:21.001 --> 22:23.369
You tracked our dealer's phone? Great.

22:23.437 --> 22:25.137
I'm on my way.

22:25.205 --> 22:26.939
Any other questions?

22:27.007 --> 22:27.807
Yeah.

22:27.874 --> 22:29.742
Why tell me all this now?

22:29.810 --> 22:32.044
Because you needed to know.

22:35.282 --> 22:37.350
MAN: <i>When I woke up a week later,</i>

22:37.417 --> 22:40.386
they'd written in
a... a wisecracking neighbor.

22:40.454 --> 22:43.856
You know, he-he got all the best lines.

22:43.924 --> 22:45.625
Your heart goes out to him, doesn't it?

22:45.692 --> 22:48.494
(sighs) A dealer trying to
find a buyer at an AA meeting,

22:48.562 --> 22:50.930
people at their most
vulnerable... that's really low.

22:50.998 --> 22:54.066
Yeah. It's also not something
my mum would even care about.

22:54.134 --> 22:56.836
Because... and I can't
believe I'm saying this...

22:56.903 --> 22:58.638
The killer isn't your mother.

22:58.705 --> 23:00.740
(sighs): Unfortunately,
I think you're right.

23:00.807 --> 23:03.376
Dear me, this has all
been a wild goose chase.

23:03.443 --> 23:05.611
Hey.

23:05.679 --> 23:07.546
There's still a
killer out there, Lucifer.

23:07.614 --> 23:09.181
And we tracked his phone to this room.

23:09.249 --> 23:10.983
We've got to figure
out who the dealer is.

23:11.051 --> 23:13.119
MAN: It was the lowest point in my life.

23:13.186 --> 23:14.453
Thanks, David.

23:14.521 --> 23:15.888
OTHERS: Thanks, David.

23:15.956 --> 23:18.900
All right, does anybody
else want to speak?

23:19.108 --> 23:21.560
Yes, I'd like to say something.

23:21.628 --> 23:23.295
Thank you.

23:26.933 --> 23:28.534
Hello.

23:28.602 --> 23:32.071
My name is Lucifer Morningstar

23:32.139 --> 23:35.307
and I...

23:35.375 --> 23:36.942
love drugs.

23:37.010 --> 23:39.211
- (people gasping)
- Love them! Mmm!

23:39.279 --> 23:41.414
Yummy, yummy, yummy. Can't get enough.

23:41.481 --> 23:43.949
And... I've got lots of money...

23:44.017 --> 23:46.752
(sniffs) mmm, that I
love spending on drugs.

23:46.820 --> 23:48.888
Not even picky. I'll do any of them.

23:48.955 --> 23:51.257
Mix them together sometimes. (chuckles)

23:51.324 --> 23:53.259
You ever done a he-she?

23:53.326 --> 23:55.628
No? A neon nod? A donk?

23:55.696 --> 23:57.930
Ah. Yeah, he knows what
I'm talking about.

23:57.998 --> 23:59.932
That man has definitely
donked. Haven't you?

24:00.000 --> 24:03.002
Uh, the theme of the
day is your lowest point.

24:03.070 --> 24:05.404
Right, my lowest
point. Well, geographically,

24:05.472 --> 24:06.872
that would be Hell, of course.

24:06.940 --> 24:10.242
Hard to get much
lower than that. (chuckles)

24:12.579 --> 24:13.846
And...

24:19.619 --> 24:23.055
Well, then I suppose it was
when my mother abandoned me.

24:25.992 --> 24:28.561
Turnabout was fair play, so I...

24:28.628 --> 24:30.996
abandoned her in turn.

24:31.064 --> 24:35.067
Didn't even give her a
chance to defend herself.

24:35.135 --> 24:36.702
I mean, what could she possibly say

24:36.770 --> 24:39.071
that would justify what she did?

24:43.744 --> 24:45.945
What would she say?

24:51.952 --> 24:54.153
Well, that was a disaster.

24:54.221 --> 24:56.188
Actually, I thought that
was really impressive.

24:56.256 --> 24:59.024
- You did? It didn't draw anyone out.
- Yep.

24:59.092 --> 25:00.626
That's not what I was impressed with.

25:00.694 --> 25:02.294
Hey, guys. Looking to score?

25:02.362 --> 25:05.564
Because I've got some really good stuff,

25:05.632 --> 25:07.032
if you've got cash.

25:07.100 --> 25:08.534
Are we playing show and tell?

25:08.602 --> 25:10.703
I got something to show you.

25:10.771 --> 25:13.416
I actually found this on the ground...
this isn't even mine. I just...

25:13.440 --> 25:14.807
(grunts)

25:14.875 --> 25:16.909
No, it-it really isn't. I...

25:16.977 --> 25:19.812
Oh, okay. Where-where
did those come from?

25:19.880 --> 25:21.814
Right. Now I've flushed out your dealer,

25:21.882 --> 25:23.282
do you mind if I...?

25:23.350 --> 25:24.850
Knock yourself out.

25:25.752 --> 25:27.086
Those really are not mine.

25:27.154 --> 25:28.733
CHLOE: Oh, of course they aren't.

25:29.191 --> 25:30.835
You don't really think I
could do that to someone?

25:30.859 --> 25:32.971
I think you were pissed off that
someone blocked your meal ticket,

25:32.995 --> 25:34.970
and I think you were trying
to send a message, yeah.

25:34.971 --> 25:37.432
Yeah, but I couldn't do that. That...

25:37.499 --> 25:39.734
Oh, God. Is that her skull?

25:39.802 --> 25:42.804
(retches) Can you
take that away, please?

25:42.871 --> 25:45.039
Not until you tell
me what you know about...

25:45.107 --> 25:46.908
(retches, coughs)

25:46.976 --> 25:49.077
Oh, God.

25:49.144 --> 25:50.311
(exhales)

25:50.379 --> 25:52.380
That poor girl.

25:53.916 --> 25:55.650
All right, if it wasn't you,

25:55.718 --> 25:58.920
then who would want to make
it look like it was?

26:00.322 --> 26:03.121
If she had a dealer before
me, you know, I...

26:03.269 --> 26:07.895
I doubt... I doubt he was
happy I stole his best buyer.

I've missed you.

27:09.758 --> 27:12.678
So, where the hell have you been, Maze?

27:13.495 --> 27:14.762
Away.

27:14.830 --> 27:16.164
Wonderfully vague,

27:16.231 --> 27:19.100
but you'll have to be a
tad more specific, I'm afraid.

27:19.168 --> 27:20.435
I needed you.

27:20.502 --> 27:21.736
Oh.

27:21.804 --> 27:25.106
So I'm supposed to just come
running whenever you need me?

Yes. That's exactly

27:27.643 --> 27:31.012
- And why is that?
- Because since fire and brimstone,

27:31.080 --> 27:32.647
that's just how it is between us.

27:32.715 --> 27:34.082
Through thick and thin.

27:34.149 --> 27:37.085
So, come on. Where were you?

27:37.152 --> 27:38.720
Shouldn't you be more concerned

27:38.787 --> 27:40.488
with the guy I just saved you from?

27:40.556 --> 27:43.991
Oh, please. I'm only vulnerable
when the detective is around.

27:44.059 --> 27:47.061
(low, muffled grunting nearby)

27:47.129 --> 27:48.730
So, who is he?

27:48.797 --> 27:52.400
LUCIFER: Amy Dodd's dick
nozzle boyfriend.

27:52.468 --> 27:56.637
- She's the actress from Leave It...
- ♪ Leave it to Leslie. ♪

27:56.705 --> 27:59.273
What? It makes me laugh.

27:59.341 --> 28:00.787
Well, he must have seen me going into

28:00.788 --> 28:02.601
Amy's trailer when I
thought she was Mum.

28:02.644 --> 28:04.145
Jealous, were you?

28:04.213 --> 28:06.347
Wanted to prove yourself to be a big boy

28:06.415 --> 28:07.749
by waving a knife in my face?

28:07.816 --> 28:09.317
Wait, your mom escaped Hell?

28:09.384 --> 28:10.184
Yes.

28:10.252 --> 28:11.853
Funny timing, isn't it?

28:11.920 --> 28:13.721
She slipped out
whilst Amenadiel was injured.

28:13.789 --> 28:14.822
And you, uh...

28:14.890 --> 28:16.924
Well, where were you, Maze?

28:16.992 --> 28:19.494
Wait, you think I'm helping her?

28:19.561 --> 28:20.828
Have you forgotten

28:20.896 --> 28:22.830
who actually tortured her in Hell?

28:22.898 --> 28:26.033
Well, desperation
makes for strange bedfellows.

28:27.269 --> 28:29.837
I've just pictured
you in bed with my mom.

28:29.905 --> 28:32.106
Oh, I can't un-see that now.

28:32.174 --> 28:35.309
So, Mama Morningstar's on the loose.

28:35.377 --> 28:37.678
I never could break that woman.

28:37.746 --> 28:39.881
She wouldn't submit.

28:39.948 --> 28:42.450
Seems like I have another chance.

28:42.518 --> 28:43.751
(low grunting)

28:43.819 --> 28:45.686
You sure he doesn't know anything?

28:46.722 --> 28:48.656
(grunts) What is wrong with you people?!

28:48.724 --> 28:50.958
Yes, I'm sure. Give me that.

28:52.561 --> 28:54.629
(muffled talking)

28:54.696 --> 28:56.430
I think he would disagree.

28:57.299 --> 28:58.065
(muffled talking)

28:58.133 --> 28:59.273
Fine.

29:01.236 --> 29:03.538
I know things... about the murder.

29:03.605 --> 29:06.774
We found the drug dealer
with the adorable devil drawings.

29:06.842 --> 29:08.910
- Case closed.
- You think Irwin killed her?

29:08.977 --> 29:11.813
- No, he'd never do that.
- Maybe, maybe not. Don't care.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.424
You guys are with the
cops, though, right?

29:13.448 --> 29:16.419
More of a day job thingy...
Got much more pressing issues

29:16.420 --> 29:18.853
at the moment. Right, seriously...

29:18.921 --> 29:21.622
if you weren't helping my
mom, then where were you?

29:23.525 --> 29:25.226
(groans): Ah...

29:28.204 --> 29:29.971
I was with a friend.

29:30.039 --> 29:31.206
Friend?

29:31.273 --> 29:32.607
Demons don't have friends.

29:32.675 --> 29:36.077
Someone who's been helping me do some...

29:37.346 --> 29:39.147
...soul-searching.

29:39.215 --> 29:40.926
What, like hunting
them down and killing them?

29:40.950 --> 29:42.784
(scoffs) I wish.

29:42.851 --> 29:44.852
That would be a lot easier.

29:44.920 --> 29:46.120
No.

29:46.188 --> 29:49.791
Now that we are stuck
here, I need to figure out...

29:49.858 --> 29:51.392
where I fit in.

29:51.460 --> 29:53.595
And she's been helping me do that.

29:53.662 --> 29:55.396
(chuckling)

29:55.464 --> 29:57.966
Thanks. I knew you wouldn't understand.

29:58.033 --> 30:00.134
- I barely do.
- (muffled talking)

30:00.202 --> 30:02.203
(continues muffled talking)

30:03.072 --> 30:04.372
What?

30:04.440 --> 30:06.241
Amy had another drug dealer.

30:06.308 --> 30:07.475
- Go on.
- She used

30:07.543 --> 30:09.677
to score big from some other
guy before she got clean.

30:09.745 --> 30:11.679
But then Gillian cut him off completely,

30:11.747 --> 30:13.414
and the guy, he was super pissed.

30:13.482 --> 30:15.617
Right, and where can I
find this other dealer?

30:15.684 --> 30:16.751
I don't know.

30:16.819 --> 30:17.885
- Oh...
- No, I-I-I swear

30:17.953 --> 30:19.120
I've never met him.

30:19.188 --> 30:20.989
Look, he goes by the name of...

30:21.056 --> 30:22.357
of Bobby B.

30:23.459 --> 30:24.726
Lovely.

30:26.061 --> 30:27.662
I thought you said

30:27.730 --> 30:30.498
this case doesn't have
anything to do with your mom anymore.

30:30.566 --> 30:32.033
It doesn't.

30:32.101 --> 30:34.235
Then why are you running
off to tell Chloe?

30:34.303 --> 30:37.705
Well, maybe there are things you
wouldn't understand about me, either.

30:37.773 --> 30:39.173
(scoffs)

30:42.711 --> 30:46.247
So you guys are
gonna let me go now, right?

30:48.450 --> 30:49.751
Of course.

30:49.818 --> 30:51.258
(chuckles)

30:51.887 --> 30:54.255
After I've had my fun.

30:54.323 --> 30:56.090
(indistinct radio transmission)

30:56.158 --> 30:58.393
- Ah, there you are!
- Oh, hey.

30:58.460 --> 31:00.695
- I've got some news on the case.
- Oh, me, too.

31:00.763 --> 31:01.929
But go on. Ladies first.

31:01.997 --> 31:04.399
Well, our drug
dealer's alibi is still shaky.

31:04.466 --> 31:06.801
Uh, but he did mention
there's another dealer.

31:06.869 --> 31:09.470
- Oh. That's what I had.
- And Amy's lawyered up,

31:09.538 --> 31:11.406
so we can't get anything out of her.

31:11.473 --> 31:13.274
And all we have on this "other dealer"

31:13.342 --> 31:15.143
is that he's selling prescription pills.

31:15.210 --> 31:16.377
Oxys. Percocet.

31:16.445 --> 31:18.705
Oh, not my faves, but
they'll do in a pinch.

31:18.706 --> 31:21.726
So if the story stands, we're looking
for someone in health care: doctor,

31:21.750 --> 31:23.830
pharmacist. I'm gonna go
through these booking sheets

31:23.886 --> 31:25.563
for anyone in the
medical industry that's

31:25.588 --> 31:27.145
been charged in the
last couple years.

31:27.189 --> 31:28.556
Right.

31:28.624 --> 31:31.025
Feel free to jump in and help me.

31:31.093 --> 31:32.093
(groans)

31:32.828 --> 31:34.696
Joy of joys.

31:34.763 --> 31:37.498
Oh, there is one thing that might help.

31:37.566 --> 31:39.000
Yeah, what's that?

31:41.970 --> 31:43.738
Bobby B.

31:43.806 --> 31:45.773
What's that?

31:45.841 --> 31:48.509
She was like a mother to her.

31:50.212 --> 31:52.180
I have some issues that
I need to work out,

31:52.247 --> 31:54.415
and I think I know just how to do it.

31:56.518 --> 31:58.619
What?

31:58.687 --> 32:01.789
(Maze laughing)

32:01.857 --> 32:05.059
- MAZE: Oh...
- What is wrong with you people!

32:05.093 --> 32:06.711
You people are nuts!

32:10.165 --> 32:11.833
(exhales)

32:12.935 --> 32:14.202
(chuckles)

32:15.070 --> 32:17.171
So you're back.

32:21.076 --> 32:22.777
I'm here.

32:22.845 --> 32:24.312
I wouldn't say I'm back.

32:24.380 --> 32:26.180
You know I was looking for you, right?

32:26.248 --> 32:28.149
After what happened?

32:28.217 --> 32:30.251
Maze, what you did for me was...

32:30.319 --> 32:31.819
(laughs softly)

32:32.888 --> 32:34.489
But you were gone.

32:34.556 --> 32:38.326
I needed to get away from Lucifer.

32:38.394 --> 32:39.427
And you.

32:39.495 --> 32:42.063
I need to figure out

32:42.131 --> 32:44.532
where I fit in in this
world. And to do that,

32:44.600 --> 32:46.200
I need some space.

32:46.268 --> 32:47.635
From the both of you.

32:47.703 --> 32:49.871
Yeah.

32:49.938 --> 32:51.873
No, I mean, I was...

32:51.940 --> 32:53.508
feeling the same thing, you know?

32:53.575 --> 32:55.276
I think some distance between us

32:55.344 --> 32:57.311
might be a good thing.

33:20.068 --> 33:22.470
Hey, can I ask you a question?

33:22.538 --> 33:23.304
Shoot.

33:23.372 --> 33:25.540
Do you really believe in God?

33:27.176 --> 33:29.644
Whoa. I was expecting more like,

33:29.711 --> 33:32.046
"Hey, Ella, what's it like moving
from Detroit to L.A.?"

33:32.114 --> 33:35.249
"Hey, Ella, how'd you survive
growing up with four brothers?"

33:35.317 --> 33:37.752
But the big "G" question
right off the top...

33:37.820 --> 33:39.253
Did not see that coming.

33:39.321 --> 33:42.223
- Okay, sorry, it's inappropriate.
- Oh, no, no, no. I actually

33:42.291 --> 33:44.492
really like talking
about it. It's my faith.

33:44.560 --> 33:46.928
It's kind of a big part of my life.

33:46.995 --> 33:50.431
So, uh, yeah, sure. Uh, hit me.

33:50.499 --> 33:52.099
Okay.

33:52.167 --> 33:54.836
Do you believe that
it all really exists?

33:54.903 --> 33:55.803
What do you mean?

33:55.871 --> 33:57.538
Say, angels.

33:57.606 --> 33:58.773
Or the Devil.

33:58.841 --> 34:01.542
That sort of thing. That's
all a metaphor, right?

34:01.610 --> 34:03.444
Maybe.

34:03.512 --> 34:04.712
Maybe not.

34:04.780 --> 34:06.614
Oh, okay. That's pretty...

34:06.682 --> 34:08.649
I just thought there would be more faith

34:08.717 --> 34:09.984
in your faith, I guess.

34:10.052 --> 34:12.386
Oh. No, see, my aunt was a nun, okay?

34:12.454 --> 34:14.565
And she always taught me
that doubt was really important.

34:14.590 --> 34:16.657
Right? I mean, if you
don't question something,

34:16.725 --> 34:18.960
then what's the point of believing it?

34:19.027 --> 34:19.827
Mm-hmm.

34:19.895 --> 34:21.094
I doubt

34:21.163 --> 34:23.130
so that I can believe.

34:23.197 --> 34:24.342
So, then, if you had the chance

34:24.366 --> 34:26.501
to prove it was all real or fake,

34:26.568 --> 34:27.502
would you do it?

34:27.569 --> 34:29.871
I mean, that kind of defeats the point,

34:29.938 --> 34:32.706
don't you think? It's faith...

34:32.774 --> 34:34.375
Roses.

34:34.443 --> 34:36.748
What? What do roses
have to do with faith?

34:36.748 --> 34:38.679
No, nothing to do with faith.

34:38.746 --> 34:40.781
And everything to do with the case.

34:40.849 --> 34:43.650
Um, okay, so I-I found nitrogen,
right, on the rods

34:43.719 --> 34:46.120
in the victim's head, and-and
it got me thinking.

34:46.188 --> 34:49.090
It could be almost anything.
And then I found

34:49.157 --> 34:50.358
the capital "K."

34:50.425 --> 34:52.360
- Capital "K"?
- Potassium? Periodic table?

34:52.427 --> 34:53.827
Why don't you just skip to the end?

34:53.862 --> 34:55.929
And... rose fertilizer.

34:55.998 --> 34:59.433
Which also has nitrogen.

34:59.501 --> 35:01.736
So the rods were taken from a garden.

35:01.803 --> 35:02.970
Exactly.

35:03.038 --> 35:04.372
Garden tools,

35:04.439 --> 35:06.507
- lawn accessories...
- Like flamingos.

35:06.575 --> 35:08.910
Well, yeah, I mean, that's
oddly specific,

35:08.977 --> 35:11.345
- but, yeah, flamingos...
- Thank you. Thank you.

35:21.189 --> 35:23.024
Mr. Morningstar.

35:23.091 --> 35:25.159
Hello, murderer.

35:25.227 --> 35:26.994
Murderer?

35:27.062 --> 35:28.262
(door shuts)

35:28.330 --> 35:29.830
I don't... I don't understand.

35:29.898 --> 35:32.833
Oh, Roberta, can we skip the
boring part where you deny it

35:32.901 --> 35:37.104
and just, uh... Let's get
to the good stuff, shall we?

35:37.172 --> 35:39.707
Does it help if I call you Bobby B.?

35:39.775 --> 35:41.242
What are you talking about?

35:41.310 --> 35:43.444
Oh. Oh, it's very simple.

35:43.512 --> 35:45.179
You stole drugs from the hospital

35:45.247 --> 35:46.480
and sold them to Amy Dodd,

35:46.548 --> 35:48.349
your biggest client, who you met on set.

35:48.417 --> 35:51.085
You introduced Gillian
to Amy, got her the job.

35:51.153 --> 35:53.688
But then she helped Amy get sober.

35:53.755 --> 35:55.790
You felt betrayed, yadda yadda yadda,

35:55.857 --> 35:58.593
you killed her. Then you
tried to frame her new dealer.

35:58.660 --> 35:59.727
Am I getting close?

35:59.795 --> 36:00.828
That's ludicrous.

36:00.896 --> 36:03.130
No. No, what's ludicrous

36:03.198 --> 36:04.799
is that you were like a mother to her,

36:04.866 --> 36:07.401
and you sacrificed
her like she was nothing.

36:07.469 --> 36:10.605
Did she mean so
little to you in the end?

36:10.672 --> 36:12.974
Really? Tell me,

36:13.041 --> 36:15.209
why would you do that? Why?

36:15.277 --> 36:16.644
You need to go now.

36:16.712 --> 36:17.712
Tell me why.

36:17.779 --> 36:18.946
Stay back.

36:19.014 --> 36:20.325
You plunged two rods into her skull

36:20.349 --> 36:22.026
to make her look like the
Devil. But, you know what,

36:22.050 --> 36:23.417
she's not the Devil... I am.

36:23.485 --> 36:26.106
Oh, ho, ho, ho! There we go!

36:26.107 --> 36:27.310
I love a game of poker.
Go on, I'll give

36:27.334 --> 36:28.600
you a freebie, just to
make it interesting.

36:28.624 --> 36:29.890
(grunts)

36:29.958 --> 36:32.259
(panting)

36:32.327 --> 36:34.495
- How is this possi...?
- (grunts)

36:34.563 --> 36:36.785
(shouting)

36:43.802 --> 36:46.003
All right. Okay. Can we just...

36:46.071 --> 36:49.173
(grunts) have a-a time-out, please?

36:53.111 --> 36:54.478
(grunting)

36:54.546 --> 36:55.880
(choking)

36:55.947 --> 36:58.682
Is this a supernatural fire poker?

36:58.750 --> 37:02.219
- How is this possible?
- (knocking)

37:02.287 --> 37:05.156
Mrs. Beliard, it's Detective Decker.

37:05.223 --> 37:07.158
Bloody hell. Of course she's here.

37:07.225 --> 37:10.127
Detective! Detective,
you need to leave.

37:10.195 --> 37:14.799
- It's gonna be over real soon.
- (choking)

37:20.472 --> 37:23.874
I know someone's in there.
I can wait out here all day.

37:23.942 --> 37:26.410
I took in that girl and I gave her a job

37:26.478 --> 37:29.647
and then she cut me
off from my best customer.

37:29.714 --> 37:33.184
So, yeah, I put three
inches of steel into her brain.

37:33.251 --> 37:34.618
And I actually liked her.

37:34.686 --> 37:36.887
LUCIFER (groans): Please.

37:36.955 --> 37:39.089
Please don't... (grunts)

37:39.157 --> 37:40.291
- please...
- What?

37:40.358 --> 37:42.326
What, you're gonna
beg for your life, huh?

37:42.394 --> 37:45.062
...don't tell anyone... (grunts)

37:45.130 --> 37:47.331
that I died like this.

37:47.399 --> 37:49.366
(choking)

37:49.434 --> 37:51.068
(panting)

37:51.136 --> 37:52.036
Just... (coughs)

37:53.672 --> 37:54.805
- (Taser clicking)
- (shouts)

37:58.376 --> 37:59.877
(panting)

38:01.413 --> 38:02.947
Nearly had her.

38:03.014 --> 38:04.982
(grunts)

38:05.050 --> 38:06.784
Yeah.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.823
(Taser clicking)

38:16.461 --> 38:18.596
(siren wailing in distance)

38:21.466 --> 38:23.901
I'm never living this down, am I?

38:23.969 --> 38:26.837
Not if I have anything to say about it.

38:26.905 --> 38:29.673
You know, you weren't
there when Ella's forensic report

38:29.741 --> 38:31.375
pointed us at Roberta.

38:31.443 --> 38:32.683
So how'd you put this together?

38:32.744 --> 38:34.678
Well, I was on the Devil's
business, Detective.

38:35.960 --> 38:37.628
(chuckles) Look, even if I told you,

38:37.695 --> 38:39.329
you'd just say I was being crazy.

38:39.397 --> 38:41.498
Hmm. That's funny.

38:41.566 --> 38:43.600
That's what your brother
was just saying about you.

38:43.668 --> 38:45.702
Oh. Amenadiel talked to you, did he?

38:45.770 --> 38:47.971
He did. He explained everything.

38:48.039 --> 38:51.174
Was very impressive. Filled
in all the gaps.

38:51.242 --> 38:52.709
But?

38:52.777 --> 38:54.711
(sighs) But I don't buy it.

38:55.747 --> 38:56.991
I don't accept that you're crazy,

38:57.015 --> 38:59.349
and I don't accept this
"Devil's business" either.

38:59.417 --> 39:00.594
All right, so what do you believe?

39:00.618 --> 39:02.252
That I need the eggs.

39:02.320 --> 39:03.754
Excuse me?

39:03.821 --> 39:06.590
It's an old joke. Guy walks
into a psychiatrist's office,

39:06.658 --> 39:08.525
he goes, "Doc, you got to help me.

39:08.593 --> 39:10.694
My brother's crazy. He
thinks he's a chicken."

39:10.762 --> 39:12.796
- (chuckles)
- And the doc goes, "Well, why don't

39:12.864 --> 39:14.231
you turn him in?" The guy goes,

39:14.299 --> 39:18.302
"You know, I would,
but I need the eggs."

39:18.369 --> 39:19.670
That's not very funny.

39:19.737 --> 39:20.637
Yeah.

39:20.705 --> 39:22.372
(sighs)

39:22.440 --> 39:24.875
Look,

39:24.942 --> 39:27.277
I don't know what your deal is,

39:27.345 --> 39:29.680
but you make me a better detective.

39:29.747 --> 39:32.449
And you've always got my back.

39:32.517 --> 39:35.385
What more could I ask for?

39:38.723 --> 39:40.657
And you need the eggs.

39:40.725 --> 39:42.066
Damn right I do.

39:42.818 --> 39:45.329
(knocking)

39:46.256 --> 39:47.356
Lucifer.

39:47.424 --> 39:48.925
We don't have an appointment.

39:48.992 --> 39:50.927
No.

39:50.994 --> 39:53.362
No, we don't. I, uh...

39:53.430 --> 39:57.099
I just wanted to drop by and say...

39:57.167 --> 39:58.935
thank you.

39:59.002 --> 40:01.304
And why's that?

40:01.371 --> 40:02.939
Because you were right.

40:03.006 --> 40:04.340
I've been blaming everybody else

40:04.408 --> 40:06.152
for the situation I'm in.
And the fact of the matter

40:06.176 --> 40:08.644
is that...

40:08.712 --> 40:11.347
(sighs) I chose to do nothing

40:11.415 --> 40:13.216
when my mother was cast out.

40:13.283 --> 40:16.319
To never ask her why
she did what she did.

40:16.386 --> 40:17.553
So that's on me.

40:17.621 --> 40:20.489
That's good, Lucifer.

40:21.391 --> 40:23.593
No.

40:23.660 --> 40:25.494
No, it's not.

40:25.562 --> 40:27.029
Why do you say that?

40:27.097 --> 40:29.031
Well, I've assumed a
lot about my mother,

40:29.099 --> 40:30.699
including the fact that
she wants revenge

40:30.734 --> 40:32.201
for what I did to her.

40:32.269 --> 40:35.271
- And now she doesn't?
- Well, it doesn't appear so, no.

40:35.339 --> 40:36.939
And why is that a bad thing?

40:37.007 --> 40:39.575
Well, because, Doctor, if
she's not coming to kill me,

40:39.643 --> 40:41.410
then I don't know what she's doing.

40:41.478 --> 40:43.913
And...

40:43.981 --> 40:45.882
(sighs)

40:45.949 --> 40:48.251
...that's truly terrifying.

40:48.318 --> 40:50.653
