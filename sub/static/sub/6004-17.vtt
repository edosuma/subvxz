you can find proof

05:28.746 --> 05:31.447
Oh, yeah. Then we
did that thing...

05:31.482 --> 05:36.159
<i>You mean warping right into a
massive solar storm at Roo-B-9?</i>

05:36.195 --> 05:37.619
Of course. How could I forget?

05:37.654 --> 05:39.354
Ah!

05:39.389 --> 05:41.248
Quill, what are you doing?

05:41.283 --> 05:42.449
What?

05:42.484 --> 05:43.800
Just making conversation.

05:43.836 --> 05:47.295
With an intelligent ship that
is clearly in love with you.

05:47.331 --> 05:49.431
So it can't be that intelligent.

05:49.466 --> 05:51.383
Technically, she's
in love with my dad.

05:51.418 --> 05:55.004
So I figure I use the whole
romance thing to get secret info,

05:55.039 --> 05:57.548
which leads us
to the Cosmic Seed.

05:57.583 --> 06:00.475
(SCOFFS) That's a plan?

06:00.510 --> 06:02.719
Lying to a woman
and exploiting her trust?

06:02.754 --> 06:03.979
That's a Quill specialty.

06:04.014 --> 06:06.882
Rora, my love, being with
you again has inspired me.

06:06.917 --> 06:10.653
Ah, you and I are... We're
gonna find the Cosmic Seed.

06:10.688 --> 06:15.048

old records from your ship's log.

06:15.084 --> 06:17.075
<i>Silly J'Son.

06:17.110 --> 06:20.545
<i>I recorded everything

06:20.580 --> 06:22.389
(CHUCKLING) Well, duh.

the Widgets, silly.

06:30.599 --> 06:33.108

RORA: <i>Evidence of what?
And why the helmet?</i>

06:35.404 --> 06:39.364
Oh, just, uh, recording the
moment for my private files.

06:39.399 --> 06:44.019
Look, I... I just want to remember
every moment we shared together.

06:44.054 --> 06:45.170
Ugh! Blech!

06:45.205 --> 06:48.085

<i>I wasted 25 years waiting for
the love and approval of a man</i>

20:23.982 --> 20:27.434
<i>who's incapable of caring
for anything but himself.</i>

20:27.469 --> 20:30.778
<i>I hope you won't make
the same mistake, Peter.</i>

20:30.814 --> 20:33.247
What will you tell J'Son?

20:33.282 --> 20:36.075
<i>With any luck,
I'll never see him again.</i>

20:36.111 --> 20:37.276
But didn't you tell my dad...

20:37.311 --> 20:38.945
<i>That I'd find you.</i>

20:38.980 --> 20:40.700
<i>I never said I'd bring you back.</i>

20:43.693 --> 20:45.668
J'SON: So it is of
paramount importance

20:45.704 --> 20:47.228
that our peacekeeping
taskforce be...

20:47.263 --> 20:48.646
PETER: Hey. I am Groot.

20:48.682 --> 20:50.573
(ALL MURMURING) This what
you've been looking for?

20:50.608 --> 20:51.608
(J'SON GASPS)

20:53.586 --> 20:55.177
Ah, a timeless tale.

20:55.212 --> 20:59.490
Son borrows father's vehicle.
Son destroys father's vehicle.

20:59.525 --> 21:02.135
You're a funny dude, Dad.

21:02.137 --> 21:03.903
I just about died laughing
when I heard you want me

21:03.938 --> 21:05.438
to help you steal
the Cosmic Seed.

21:05.473 --> 21:07.757
For the second time!

21:07.792 --> 21:10.117
Yeah, that's right,
King Liar-Head here

21:10.152 --> 21:12.433
stole the Cosmic Seed
from Asgard!

21:13.172 --> 21:17.533
<i>This is an unmitigated
act of war with Asgard!</i>

21:17.568 --> 21:21.262
<i>There will only be peace
when we have wiped Spartax</i>

21:21.297 --> 21:24.298
<i>from the face of the galaxy!</i>

21:24.333 --> 21:26.308
PETER: Wait! There's
more I need to show you!

21:26.343 --> 21:27.627
Guards!

21:27.662 --> 21:30.246
(GUNS COCKING) Oh.

21:30.248 --> 21:38.248
I thought the truth was
supposed to set you free.
