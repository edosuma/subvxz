00:01.400 --> 00:04.074
I don't know whether you know that there's been a shooting.

00:05.440 --> 00:08.558
It was the detective we saw near the Falls Road on Sunday night.

00:08.720 --> 00:10.791
<i>James Olson was a married man, Stella.</i>

00:10.960 --> 00:14.192
You were a married man when you spent a night in my bed.

00:14.360 --> 00:17.717
I'd like you to meet the girls of Monroe Air.

00:18.160 --> 00:20.152
- It was an accident.

00:21.360 --> 00:23.477
<i>All I want is for somebody to hold me...</i>

00:24.640 --> 00:26.518
<i>..tell me I'm gonna be all right.</i>

00:26.680 --> 00:28.751
- Liz needs help, Jimmy.
- Stay away from my wife.

00:28.920 --> 00:30.559
Or I'll kill you and your wife.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.040
And your kids.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.840
<i>He clearly has a victim type.</i>

00:35.000 --> 00:37.993
They are not victims of chance, they are victims of choice.

00:38.160 --> 00:41.756
<i>It's possible that he's out there stalking his next victim now.</i>

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074

00:51.160 --> 00:55.518
It is with great sorrow and regret that I can confirm the identity of the officer

00:55.680 --> 00:59.674
killed in the line of duty on Monday in north Belfast.

01:00.640 --> 01:05.236
<i>Detective Sergeant James Olson was a dedicated and hardworking policeman,</i>

01:05.400 --> 01:07.596
<i>liked and respected by his colleagues.</i>

01:08.560 --> 01:13.237
<i>Just 31 years old, he leaves behind a wife and two small children.</i>

01:14.000 --> 01:17.471
<i>On behalf of all the law-abiding citizens of Northern Ireland,</i>

01:17.640 --> 01:23.432
<i>I wish to offer my deep condolences to his family, his friends and his colleagues.</i>

02:03.600 --> 02:05.319
- Danni? <i>- Yes, ma'am?</i>

02:05.480 --> 02:09.872
I got the lab report back on the varnish that was used on Sarah Kay's finger and toenails.

02:10.039 --> 02:13.670
<i>It's called Jezebel Red, it's by Connell, part of their Painted Lady range.</i>

02:13.840 --> 02:15.832
Sold everywhere, unfortunately.

02:17.360 --> 02:19.352
<i>- Right.</i>
- Can you get me some?

02:21.200 --> 02:22.714
The shops aren't open yet.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.672
You'll think of something.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.078
- Daddy!
- Hey.

02:42.680 --> 02:44.637
Eugh, you're sweaty.

02:44.800 --> 02:46.632
I thought you were at work.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.678
I got back early, went for a run.

02:48.840 --> 02:51.355
Instead of being here to help me with the kids?

02:53.360 --> 02:55.750
Must be nice to have all that energy to burn.

02:56.560 --> 02:58.552
Get your things. Time to go.

03:00.240 --> 03:02.232
- Liam!
- Here.

03:09.640 --> 03:13.919
Right, I'm leaving now. If anyone's coming with me, they'd better hurry up.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.392
Bye, Pops.

04:29.480 --> 04:33.713
I took a call on Olson's phone the morning after the shooting from an unregistered mobile.

04:33.880 --> 04:35.553
The number subsequently went dead.

04:35.720 --> 04:38.280
The call came from somewhere inside this hotel.

04:38.440 --> 04:39.954
We checked the register.

04:40.120 --> 04:43.113
A suite was booked in the name of Belfast Events Ltd.

04:43.280 --> 04:46.557
Company director: Aaron Monroe.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.392
This is the next morning.

04:51.840 --> 04:53.832
Breedlove with one of the girls.

04:54.800 --> 04:57.759
The suite has been cleaned at least twice since then.

04:57.920 --> 05:00.958
But we still found traces of Class A drugs and blood.

05:01.120 --> 05:06.434
These two were picked up an hour or so later by Morgan Monroe's driver.

05:07.920 --> 05:13.314
Both Rossmeisl and Lang made substantial contributions to the Alice Monroe fund.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.076
How do Breedlove and Olson fit into this?

05:26.160 --> 05:30.234
Back in the day, Breedlove was Morgan Monroe's close protection officer.

05:30.400 --> 05:33.871
He might have been there moonlighting, providing security.

05:35.200 --> 05:39.194
He might have been there to supply them with the drugs and/or the girls.

05:39.880 --> 05:41.633
Olson, I'm not sure.

05:42.960 --> 05:48.592
It's starting to look like my praise for a dear departed colleague was fabulously premature.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.871
We have a facility on Breedlove's phone.

05:52.040 --> 05:54.509
He put in a call to Aaron Monroe this morning.

05:55.080 --> 05:59.074
He seems to have some concerns that he might meet the same fate as Olson.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.431
Looking at this girl's face,

06:03.160 --> 06:06.232
if she's badly injured, that's a loss of earnings right there.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.710
These girls make ten grand a week, easily.

06:09.520 --> 06:12.957
Breedlove seemed to be suggesting that this has happened before.

06:13.120 --> 06:16.955
He talked about making a payment of 30 grand to someone called Mirko.

06:17.120 --> 06:20.830
The girls flew into Dublin from Heathrow, then came north by road.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.832
I'm making enquiries with the Met.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.478
- Bring him in.
- Breedlove?

06:30.160 --> 06:31.594
Bring him in.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.520
Paul?

06:42.400 --> 06:43.629
Paul!

06:45.680 --> 06:46.955
Paul!

06:53.400 --> 06:55.676
- Did you not hear me calling you?
- When, George?

06:55.840 --> 06:57.718
You just passed me in the corridor.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.872
Did I? Didn't see you.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.713
I have an appointment.

07:07.880 --> 07:10.634
And I've just had James Tyler in here this morning.

07:10.800 --> 07:14.191
To say he was angry would be a considerable understatement.

07:15.040 --> 07:19.353
He says you made an unscheduled house call on his wife when she was home alone.

07:20.960 --> 07:23.270
It wasn't unscheduled. She called, very upset.

07:23.440 --> 07:25.716
Why didn't you have an appointment here?

07:26.400 --> 07:28.790
You know he beats her? She was black and blue.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.952
Then you report it to the police.

07:31.360 --> 07:35.320
There are protocols that you seem to think you can ignore with impunity.

07:35.480 --> 07:38.473
Anyway, she has an appointment. She's coming in today.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.472
It's not in the diary.

07:40.920 --> 07:42.991
I need to make a phone call to confirm.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.834
Did you talk to any of the local residents when you were there,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.310
discuss Mr Tyler's personal business with them?

07:51.640 --> 07:53.518
Does that seem likely?

07:53.680 --> 07:55.000
I don't know.

07:55.160 --> 07:56.560
You tell me.

07:57.480 --> 07:59.153
I asked for some directions.

07:59.320 --> 08:01.915
- Maybe they saw my name tag.
- You bet your life they did.

08:02.080 --> 08:06.279
This is Shankill, not some place you can come and go willy-nilly without being noticed.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.795
- Willy-nilly?
- You know what I mean.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.915
I'd like to talk to Mrs Tyler when she comes in.

08:35.159 --> 08:37.038
<i>Detective Inspector Breedlove?</i>

08:37.200 --> 08:39.192
- Speaking. <i>- It's DCI Eastwood.</i>

08:39.960 --> 08:41.952
<i>I'd like to have a talk with you, Rob.</i>

08:42.840 --> 08:44.832
- When? <i>- Right away, if possible.</i>

08:48.520 --> 08:49.670
What about?

08:49.840 --> 08:54.278
<i>I think you might be able to help me clarify some issues surrounding the murder of James Olson.</i>

08:54.440 --> 08:56.432
<i>I'd appreciate your help.</i>

09:00.480 --> 09:01.994
I'll come in.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.319
I have to go.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.112
Don't be long.

10:17.080 --> 10:22.200
The Mosuo women are a small ethic group living in China on the border with Tibet.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.278
They're a matriarchal society.

10:25.440 --> 10:27.432
Well, matrilineal.

10:27.800 --> 10:31.589
They don't practise traditional marriage, no husbands and wives.

10:32.200 --> 10:34.715
They practise what's called walking marriage.

10:36.320 --> 10:38.789
The partners live in different households.

10:39.440 --> 10:41.079
I'm simplifying.

10:43.040 --> 10:46.920
One of Sarah Kay's work colleagues said she talked about them at the bar

10:47.080 --> 10:49.231
on the night that she called you to the house.

10:50.160 --> 10:54.359
Drinking wine with her friends suggests to me she didn't know she was pregnant.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.478
She didn't tell any of her family

10:57.640 --> 11:01.190
and no one's come forward to say that they're the father.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.875
So I thought maybe it was just a sweet night.

11:04.760 --> 11:06.194
What's that?

11:07.360 --> 11:09.716
It's what the Mosuo women call a secret visit

11:09.880 --> 11:13.794
when a woman asks a man to spend the night and then leave in the morning.

11:15.520 --> 11:17.079
How do you know so much about it?

11:17.240 --> 11:19.232
It's not a secret.

11:23.360 --> 11:25.317
My first degree was in anthropology.

11:25.480 --> 11:28.678
- Your first degree?
- Mm, I have hundreds.

11:31.640 --> 11:33.518
I need you to come in.

11:33.680 --> 11:35.512
<i>I can't.</i>

11:35.680 --> 11:38.559
Liz, I shouldn't have called on you at home like that.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.712
It's against the rules.

11:42.240 --> 11:44.232
My job is on the line.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.232
Jimmy needn't know.

11:48.320 --> 11:50.710
I just want you to come in this afternoon.

11:52.040 --> 11:53.599
<i>I can't.</i>

11:54.480 --> 11:55.709
Why?

11:57.320 --> 11:59.516
<i>I don't want to see anyone at the moment.</i>

12:02.360 --> 12:05.239
Put on a headscarf and some dark glasses.

12:06.120 --> 12:07.998
You'll look like Sophia Loren.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.640
<i>Who's she?</i>

12:13.040 --> 12:15.032
You asked me to hold you, Liz.

12:15.920 --> 12:17.912
And I held you.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.592
Now I'm asking you to do this for me.

13:13.840 --> 13:15.035
Robbie.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.192
Come on through.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.192
Do you want kids?

13:26.160 --> 13:28.117
Maybe one day.

13:29.800 --> 13:31.280
Do you have a man?

13:31.440 --> 13:32.999
A man?

13:34.240 --> 13:35.310
No.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.754
I'm gay.

13:47.360 --> 13:51.639
The neighbours report hearing a hairdryer in the early hours of the morning.

13:51.800 --> 13:53.792
Perhaps he was drying her body.

13:58.360 --> 14:00.352
Perhaps he was drying the nails.

14:15.680 --> 14:18.434
- Where were you when I called you?
- At the Olson's.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.592
How are they? Are they bearing up?

14:21.040 --> 14:23.032
I don't think it's really sunk in yet.

14:23.720 --> 14:27.794
Your phone records show a lot of calls to the Olson home number.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.038
You've pulled my phone records?

14:32.200 --> 14:33.714
Why so many calls?

14:35.280 --> 14:37.954
He was my partner...my friend.

14:40.600 --> 14:44.196
A high proportion of those calls were at times Olson was at work.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.798
Often at work with you.

14:49.520 --> 14:51.512
Were those calls made to Vicky?

14:54.840 --> 14:56.718
Do you know why I joined the police force?

14:56.880 --> 14:58.200
I don't.

14:58.360 --> 15:00.079
That bomb in '87.

15:01.360 --> 15:02.714
Lost his father.

15:02.880 --> 15:05.520
Would have been six at the time, same age as Rory.

15:05.680 --> 15:07.353
I don't remember the name Olson.

15:07.520 --> 15:09.512
His mother remarried.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.118
It was me called his phone that morning when you answered.

15:17.280 --> 15:19.840
Robbie...be careful what you say now.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.913
I had no idea he was already dead, you have to believe me.

15:23.080 --> 15:26.391
You should take legal advice before you say anything more.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.516
Gunned down in the street in front of his son.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.558
Fucking shitbags.

15:31.720 --> 15:33.040
Who?

15:33.200 --> 15:34.714
Who's a shitbag? Mclnturff?

15:34.880 --> 15:36.314
Yes, Mclnturff.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.998
Do you really believe that?

15:40.160 --> 15:42.834
Or was your outburst at the station all for show?

15:47.000 --> 15:49.276
- Have you had someone following me?
- No.

15:49.440 --> 15:51.591
- A car was on my tail here.
- Nothing to do with me.

15:51.760 --> 15:54.400
- You swear?
- I swear.

16:00.600 --> 16:02.478
I'm gonna have to caution you, Rob.

16:02.640 --> 16:05.519
- Are you arresting me?
- We want to get this sorted.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.520
Are you carrying a firearm?

16:07.680 --> 16:08.716
No.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.440
- Where is it?
- It's in my desk drawer.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.159
I had someone check your desk.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.392
If I'd just lost a partner,

16:21.520 --> 16:23.398
and I feared I might be next,

16:23.560 --> 16:25.552
I'd be carrying.

16:28.160 --> 16:30.516
I need to take the weapon from you, Rob. I'm sorry.

16:39.280 --> 16:40.680
It's all right.

16:41.680 --> 16:43.353
I understand.

16:43.520 --> 16:45.591
You're just doing what you have to do.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.796
All of this can be sorted out really easily.

16:53.960 --> 16:55.952
Really, really easily.

17:08.760 --> 17:10.479
Somebody call an ambulance!

17:13.160 --> 17:14.640
Get this woman out.

17:24.560 --> 17:26.551
Matthew, Matthew...

17:27.920 --> 17:29.912
Come with me.

17:33.040 --> 17:34.633
Get everybody out.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.120
Jerry.

17:39.960 --> 17:41.952
Seal these rooms off.

17:44.520 --> 17:45.749
Call Forensics.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.791
Matthew...can you hear me?

17:48.960 --> 17:50.838
Look at me.

17:51.880 --> 17:53.872
Matthew, what happened in there?

17:54.760 --> 17:57.229
- What happened?
- He was handing me his gun.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.915
Then he put it to his face...fired.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.753
- Deliberately?
- Yes.

18:02.920 --> 18:05.594
- It wasn't just a threat and the gun went off?
- No.

18:05.760 --> 18:07.752
No, he meant to do it.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.632
- Do you have your gun on you?
- No.

18:15.160 --> 18:18.153
I'm gonna get a CSI here to take your clothes, all right?

18:18.320 --> 18:20.312
- Yes.
- Right.

18:22.680 --> 18:26.037
We're gonna do this right. We're gonna sort this out.

18:35.080 --> 18:37.072
Do you feel afraid at home?

18:43.320 --> 18:45.312
It's unacceptable, Liz.

18:46.520 --> 18:49.433
You have the right to feel safe in your own home.

18:50.280 --> 18:51.839
I start it.

18:52.440 --> 18:54.113
I throw things at him.

18:54.280 --> 18:56.272
I provoke him.

18:59.360 --> 19:01.238
Even if that's true,

19:01.400 --> 19:05.838
the responsibility for domestic violence always lies with the abuser, Liz.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.872
Never with the abused.

19:10.760 --> 19:12.752
He wasn't always like this.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.272
It's been since Danny died.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.878
You're wearing a long-sleeved top.

19:28.040 --> 19:30.032
That's unusual for you.

19:32.560 --> 19:34.153
Are you self-harming?

19:34.320 --> 19:35.913
No.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.592
Does he force you sexually?

19:56.080 --> 19:58.834
As your counsellor, Liz, I'm not supposed to give advice.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.992
But these people can.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.513
He's out of prison on licence.

20:13.480 --> 20:16.359
If I call the police, he'll go straight back to jail.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.392
I can't do that to him.

20:22.640 --> 20:24.040
Liz...

20:24.640 --> 20:27.838
under the Domestic Violence Crime And Victims Act,

20:28.000 --> 20:31.516
charges can be brought against your husband without your permission.

20:32.520 --> 20:34.512
I can make the call.

20:36.480 --> 20:39.598
But it's important for you that you do it yourself.

20:41.680 --> 20:44.354
They can arrange a shelter until he's arrested.

20:48.240 --> 20:49.959
I'm offering you a lifeline.

20:52.920 --> 20:54.320
Take it.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.000
Can we talk?

21:23.160 --> 21:24.833
I have to wash.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.673
I'll come with you.

21:36.400 --> 21:40.076
It seems Breedlove was having an affair with James Olson's wife.

21:42.480 --> 21:44.472
Why are you telling me?

21:46.120 --> 21:47.998
I thought it might help...

21:48.160 --> 21:50.152
if you were feeling at all guilty.

21:50.680 --> 21:52.114
I'm not.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.717
It's unclear whether Olson knew or not,

21:56.760 --> 21:58.752
whether he suspected anything.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.112
How was he when he was with you?

22:05.960 --> 22:07.838
Fine. We've been over this.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.754
But the text messages, picture images,

22:10.920 --> 22:12.877
breaching the cordon at a crime scene.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.918
They all surprise me.

22:15.080 --> 22:16.878
I read him wrong.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.918
In what way?

22:19.080 --> 22:22.596
I thought he was the type to accept it for what it was and move on.

22:23.840 --> 22:25.479
A sweet night.

22:26.640 --> 22:27.869
What?

22:29.360 --> 22:30.476
Nothing.

22:33.440 --> 22:36.797
Do you have any idea of the effect you have on men?

22:39.360 --> 22:41.352
I'd have left my wife...

22:42.680 --> 22:44.478
..my kids...

22:45.520 --> 22:47.318
..everything for you.

22:49.920 --> 22:51.912
That would have been a mistake.

22:59.080 --> 23:00.196
I'm sorry.

23:02.640 --> 23:04.632
I shouldn't have said that.

23:07.320 --> 23:09.312
I'm sorry.

23:13.320 --> 23:16.518
Thank you...for handling things so calmly.

23:18.280 --> 23:20.272
And so efficiently.

23:59.640 --> 24:01.120
Boss?

24:02.400 --> 24:04.995
All three victims are on professional websites,

24:05.160 --> 24:07.038
all have a detailed profile,

24:07.200 --> 24:09.795
all with a professional portrait photograph.

24:11.080 --> 24:12.958
Maybe this is how he finds them.

24:13.120 --> 24:16.796
If the killer's trawling professional websites looking for victims,

24:16.960 --> 24:19.680
should we do the same to identify potential targets?

24:20.560 --> 24:22.438
I'm not sure we can.

24:22.600 --> 24:26.799
If we do identify women who we think conform to the killer's type, what do we do?

24:26.960 --> 24:28.952
- Warn them.

24:29.800 --> 24:33.476
If we warn them, we have to protect them and we don't have the resources.

24:35.160 --> 24:37.038
- Hello? <i>- Hi, it's me.</i>

24:37.200 --> 24:41.353
<i>The crime scene is being released back to the family and I'd like to take another look.</i>

24:41.520 --> 24:43.398
- When? <i>- Now.</i>

24:43.560 --> 24:45.552
I'll meet you there.

25:06.360 --> 25:08.352
Mrs Shergold and I would like a word.

25:09.720 --> 25:10.836
When?

25:11.000 --> 25:12.320
Now.

25:22.560 --> 25:25.712
Home visiting can be very useful from a diagnostic point of view.

25:25.880 --> 25:27.758
It's in breach of department guidelines.

25:27.920 --> 25:32.199
Seeing someone in their home can provide unexpected information about their psyche.

25:32.360 --> 25:34.477
Paul...please.

25:35.360 --> 25:36.919
"Paul...please"?

25:37.080 --> 25:40.232
Mrs Shergold is in complete agreement with me over this matter.

25:40.400 --> 25:43.871
The protocols are in place to protect you as well as the clients.

25:44.040 --> 25:46.794
We simply cannot tolerate any further indiscipline.

25:46.960 --> 25:49.873
Consider this an official warning. You'll be receiving a letter.

25:50.040 --> 25:53.272
<i>- You'll</i> be receiving a letter.
- What?

25:53.440 --> 25:54.669
What?

25:56.320 --> 25:57.993
I'm sorry, I'm not following.

25:58.160 --> 26:00.152
I'm sorry, <i>I'm</i> not following.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.232
- Are you taking this seriously?
- Are <i>you</i> taking this seriously?

26:05.400 --> 26:07.278
I don't understand.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.432
Then let me explain.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.238
I've just done a good thing.

26:12.400 --> 26:14.278
A very good thing.

26:14.440 --> 26:17.319
And thanks to me, Liz Tyler can sleep safe tonight.

26:18.040 --> 26:20.191
You people should be congratulating me,

26:20.360 --> 26:23.273
not bleating on about petty rules and regulations.

26:30.480 --> 26:33.552
Where was he hiding, do you think...

26:35.000 --> 26:36.992
..when he first attacked her?

26:38.480 --> 26:40.153
In here?

26:53.560 --> 26:55.199
Or from here?

26:56.600 --> 26:58.478
<i>She's at the top of the stairs.</i>

26:58.640 --> 27:01.235
<i>He comes out fast, overpowers her.</i>

27:03.440 --> 27:05.432
<i>So he lifts her...</i>

27:06.760 --> 27:09.753
..carries her, struggling, into the bedroom.

27:10.920 --> 27:13.958
He gets her onto the bed, pins her down.

27:14.120 --> 27:16.112
Then he ties her to the bed frame.

27:17.160 --> 27:20.551
The ligature marks suggest maybe here and there.

27:23.280 --> 27:27.354
You know, it's possible he was in here with her and had her tied up

27:27.520 --> 27:30.991
and there were patrol cops at the front door.

27:32.320 --> 27:35.597
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah, the answering machine was over there.

27:39.120 --> 27:41.430
It was set to play messages as they came in.

27:43.280 --> 27:46.273
She might even have heard the call.

27:46.440 --> 27:48.557
<i>This is PC Danni Ferrington.</i>

27:48.720 --> 27:51.394
<i>- I'm calling from outside your place.</i>

27:51.560 --> 27:53.552
<i>If you are there, it is the police at the door.</i>

27:53.720 --> 27:57.396
<i>I was hoping to speak with you to follow up on the incident that occurred on Friday.</i>

27:57.560 --> 28:00.155
- Please ring the number I gave...
- Why these women?

28:00.320 --> 28:03.438
Why professional women? What's he punishing them for?

28:12.120 --> 28:14.077
What will you tell your daughters...

28:14.240 --> 28:15.993
in the future...

28:16.160 --> 28:18.152
about how to stay safe?

28:19.640 --> 28:21.518
Pretty much what I tell them now.

28:21.680 --> 28:23.637
"Don't talk to strange men."

28:26.000 --> 28:27.593
Strange men?

28:28.960 --> 28:30.633
Any man.

28:48.720 --> 28:49.756
Hey!

28:51.040 --> 28:52.440
Hey!

28:55.320 --> 28:56.800
You going home?

28:56.960 --> 28:58.952
- Yes.
- Do you want a lift?

29:00.520 --> 29:02.000
I'm OK walking.

29:03.680 --> 29:06.673
Haven't you heard? There's a strangler on the prowl.

29:08.640 --> 29:10.632
Are you gonna protect me?

29:35.360 --> 29:36.840
What's it like?

29:37.000 --> 29:41.313
You know, being face to face with someone who's killed over and over?

29:42.200 --> 29:44.192
- You're thinking of Moon?
- Mm.

29:44.920 --> 29:47.435
I directed the interviews, I didn't speak to him personally.

29:47.600 --> 29:49.717
How do you interview someone like that?

29:50.560 --> 29:53.234
With Moon, it was easy. He wanted to talk.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.631
Most of the time, he seemed deranged.

29:57.240 --> 30:00.916
During his trial, he had to be removed from the court for singing.

30:01.880 --> 30:03.758
He was an idiot.

30:03.920 --> 30:10.190
We had CCTV footage of him arriving at his block of flats with a nice new suitcase,

30:10.360 --> 30:11.999
clearly empty,

30:12.160 --> 30:15.392
and then leaving an hour later dragging it along the ground.

30:15.560 --> 30:18.200
- Moving a body?
- What was left of it.

30:19.240 --> 30:21.391
The prime cuts were in the freezer.

30:25.480 --> 30:27.472
When I was a DC,

30:27.920 --> 30:30.480
I spent years as a lead interviewer.

30:31.600 --> 30:34.513
And the techniques are pretty standard.

30:35.560 --> 30:37.870
You try and establish a rapport.

30:38.040 --> 30:40.191
- With a cannibal?
- With anybody.

30:40.360 --> 30:44.957
You start with what you know, you present the facts that you have at your disposal.

30:46.080 --> 30:48.072
And you take it from there.

30:53.400 --> 30:55.198
I've been thinking a lot lately...

30:55.840 --> 30:57.638
about a friend of mine.

30:58.400 --> 30:59.629
Really, why?

31:00.440 --> 31:04.514
When she was a student, she was briefly with a guy who...

31:06.440 --> 31:09.194
..almost strangled her to death one night.

31:09.360 --> 31:11.317
In bed.

31:12.840 --> 31:14.320
Where was this?

31:14.480 --> 31:16.312
In Belfast.

31:16.480 --> 31:17.880
When?

31:19.440 --> 31:21.432
About eight or nine years ago.

31:22.440 --> 31:24.318
Did she report it to the police?

31:24.480 --> 31:25.914
No, she didn't.

31:26.520 --> 31:28.512
She's married now and has children.

31:29.800 --> 31:31.792
I know she's never told her husband.

31:32.840 --> 31:34.832
What's her name?

31:35.520 --> 31:39.036
<i>? You walked me home in the dark</i>

31:40.320 --> 31:43.597
<i>? Streets wet from rain near the park</i>

31:44.680 --> 31:47.639
<i>? We said goodbye at my door</i>

31:47.800 --> 31:52.113
<i>? And I knew then that life could be so much more</i>

31:55.960 --> 31:59.112
<i>? Rain brought me back to your door</i>

32:00.560 --> 32:03.314
<i>? You held me down on the floor</i>

32:04.800 --> 32:07.440
<i>? I saw the pain in your eyes</i>

32:07.600 --> 32:12.117
<i>? And I knew then that love would be my demise</i>

32:12.280 --> 32:13.600
<i>? And I know</i>

32:14.360 --> 32:16.238
<i>? Yes, I know</i>
- It's just right.

32:16.400 --> 32:20.952
<i>? From the tips of my fingers to the ring on my toe</i>

32:21.120 --> 32:22.998
<i>? I know</i>

32:23.160 --> 32:25.038
<i>? Yes, I know</i>

32:25.200 --> 32:28.955
<i>? That the love in my heart will grow</i>

32:29.120 --> 32:31.112
<i>? If you are mine</i>

32:31.520 --> 32:33.318
<i>? If you are mine</i>

32:33.720 --> 32:35.598
<i>? If you are mine</i>

33:26.760 --> 33:28.752
I meant to show you.

33:32.160 --> 33:34.152
Another of Livvy's drawings.

33:44.920 --> 33:46.639
Where did she get this paper?

33:47.320 --> 33:48.470
What?

33:50.320 --> 33:52.596
I'm just wondering where she got the paper.

33:52.760 --> 33:54.638
There's a baby at work.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.678
She's really poorly.

33:56.840 --> 33:58.115
Her mother...

33:59.120 --> 34:01.112
..she's only 18 herself.

34:02.760 --> 34:05.434
But she's really devoted, a really good mother.

34:09.199 --> 34:11.192
It's really got to me.

34:14.560 --> 34:16.358
I can tell.

34:23.239 --> 34:25.232
Come back to bed.

34:26.320 --> 34:29.119
I guess she hears me talking about babies' mothers.

34:29.280 --> 34:31.556
I get upset and then I get short with them.

34:32.600 --> 34:35.752
And then there's all the stuff in the papers at the moment.

34:35.920 --> 34:37.797
She doesn't read the papers.

34:37.960 --> 34:39.952
It's on the telly, on the radio.

34:49.960 --> 34:51.952
Her teacher says it's just a stage.

34:54.320 --> 34:57.791
She doesn't just draw what she sees, she draws what she knows.

34:59.120 --> 35:01.715
She knows a pregnant lady has a baby in her tummy.

35:01.880 --> 35:03.633
That's all.

35:29.200 --> 35:31.032
Armed police, open up!

35:35.880 --> 35:37.872
- Police!

35:44.000 --> 35:46.799
Oi! Oi! What are you fucking doing?

35:51.120 --> 35:52.520
- Jimmy!
- James Tyler...

35:52.680 --> 35:56.993
I'm arresting you for assault and actual bodily harm on your wife, Liz Tyler.

35:57.560 --> 35:59.438
You do not have to say anything

35:59.600 --> 36:02.513
but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned

36:02.680 --> 36:04.876
something that you may later rely on in court.

36:05.040 --> 36:07.760
Anything you do say may be given in evidence. Understand?

36:07.920 --> 36:09.115
Get fucking off me!

36:09.280 --> 36:10.714
Get in there!

36:11.160 --> 36:12.992
That's it, lads, well done.

36:19.760 --> 36:21.638
- It could be a lot worse.
- How?

36:21.800 --> 36:25.794
He hasn't got hold of the fact that they went back again on Sunday night.

36:39.200 --> 36:42.591
Ferrington has effectively been taken off Uniform duties.

36:44.240 --> 36:46.516
Stone has been assigned to another team.

36:47.240 --> 36:49.596
Because it's out there at last, I can move on.

36:49.760 --> 36:52.559
If you'd like to explain that to the Policing Executive.

36:52.720 --> 36:56.316
Why is it your responsibility? Leave that to Uniform to deal with.

36:56.480 --> 36:58.676
- I need to take this.

37:00.720 --> 37:02.074
Gibson.

37:02.240 --> 37:03.833
<i>McCurdy, ma'am.</i>

37:04.000 --> 37:05.992
<i>It seems the killer of Sarah Kay...</i>

37:08.240 --> 37:10.232
Morgan, I hoped I'd run into you.

37:12.400 --> 37:15.040
Sorry, sir, I have to go. There's been a development.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.591
Take my car. Keep me up to speed.

37:23.080 --> 37:24.958
I haven't long, I'm afraid, Jim.

37:25.120 --> 37:26.998
This won't take long, Morgan.

37:27.160 --> 37:29.470
I'm banking on your support today.

37:30.600 --> 37:34.674
The investigation into the murder of those three young women, Alice included,

37:34.840 --> 37:37.435
the murder of Michael Lockwood and James Olson,

37:37.600 --> 37:39.671
the apparent suicide of Rob Breedlove,

37:39.840 --> 37:42.958
has stretched us very thin - to breaking point, in fact.

37:43.840 --> 37:46.196
I'm not sure I can give you that support, Jim.

37:46.360 --> 37:48.829
I was speaking to the Chief Constable today...

37:49.000 --> 37:53.631
The investigation into the murder of James Olson has thrown up uncomfortable details.

37:54.280 --> 37:56.476
Uncomfortable, I think, for both of us.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.396
Like?

38:00.960 --> 38:05.239
Like one of my officers being present in a hotel suite with your son

38:05.400 --> 38:09.519
and two of your German business colleagues on the night Olson was killed.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.795
A hotel suite where prostitutes were present,

38:13.400 --> 38:16.199
where serious Class A drugs were being consumed,

38:16.760 --> 38:18.956
and where a serious assault took place.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.277
We'll continue to ventilate her and provide pain relief.

38:27.920 --> 38:31.197
But I think the time has come to let nature take its course.

38:32.560 --> 38:35.155
We will withdraw intensive care this morning.

38:39.320 --> 38:42.518
- How long will it take?
- A matter of hours.

38:48.480 --> 38:50.472
Will you stay with me?

38:51.160 --> 38:53.277
Yes, of course.

38:56.400 --> 38:59.279
It came with this morning's post, addressed to me.

39:00.080 --> 39:02.356
I opened it and Marion has touched it too.

39:03.640 --> 39:05.040
That's it.

39:12.480 --> 39:16.110
Mary, would you read that out loud for me? Would that be all right?

39:16.280 --> 39:17.794
Of course.

39:22.640 --> 39:24.233
"Dear Mr Kay,

39:24.400 --> 39:27.757
I saw your other daughter, Marion, named in the newspaper...

39:27.920 --> 39:32.915
..and was able to obtain her address without difficulty.

39:33.080 --> 39:36.278
I also saw that you had to identify your daughter's body,

39:37.240 --> 39:39.232
and I'm sorry you had to do that.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.994
Please understand, I would never have killed her if I'd known she was pregnant.

39:44.160 --> 39:46.038
Babies are innocent.

39:46.200 --> 39:48.874
And I've always felt very protective of children.

39:49.720 --> 39:52.713
Part of me says, 'What's one less person on this earth?'

39:52.880 --> 39:55.952
Part of me hopes I do not have to meet you face to face

39:56.120 --> 39:58.112
in this world or the next to explain.

40:00.160 --> 40:02.755
I took her driver's licence from her blue wallet.

40:02.920 --> 40:04.752
Now I'm giving it back.

40:04.920 --> 40:06.912
You won't see the cat again.

40:07.960 --> 40:09.952
Cats are evil creatures.

40:11.400 --> 40:14.950
One must have chaos in oneself to give birth to a dancing star."

41:01.920 --> 41:03.912
Who are you?

41:06.200 --> 41:08.078
It's from Thus Spake Zara...

41:08.240 --> 41:10.118
Zarathustra.

41:10.280 --> 41:12.272
- Yes.
- Nietzsche.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.120
Have you got the context?

41:15.400 --> 41:21.510
"I say unto you, one must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star.

41:22.440 --> 41:25.353
Alas, the time of the most despicable man is coming.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.913
He that is no longer able to despise himself.

41:30.080 --> 41:32.072
Behold, I show you the last man.

41:33.200 --> 41:38.958
'What is love, what is creation, what is longing, what is a star?'

41:39.600 --> 41:42.240
Thus asks the last man and blinks."

41:52.440 --> 41:54.830
We have your fingerprints on record, Marion.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.992
We're going to need yours too, sir.

41:58.240 --> 41:59.720
Of course.

41:59.880 --> 42:04.352
We'll take a look at these fingerprints, paper analysis, ink analysis.

42:04.520 --> 42:06.512
We'll check for indentations.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.117
This could be very significant for us.

42:19.360 --> 42:22.114
He talks about meeting me in this world or the next.

42:22.280 --> 42:23.236
Yes.

42:23.400 --> 42:26.279
I believe he has had faith at some point in his life.

42:29.040 --> 42:31.032
I'd like to make an appeal.

42:32.040 --> 42:33.997
A public appeal.

42:36.680 --> 42:38.831
I'd like to ask him to stop what he's doing,

42:39.000 --> 42:40.878
stop these terrible crimes,

42:41.040 --> 42:43.874
give himself up, repent

42:44.040 --> 42:46.032
and ask for God's forgiveness.

42:56.600 --> 42:58.876
<i>Hey, Joan, it's me. How are the kids?</i>

42:59.040 --> 43:00.520
<i>Ah, they're grand.</i>

43:00.680 --> 43:04.037
<i>- Has Paul left for work yet?
- Ten, 15 minutes ago.</i>

43:05.440 --> 43:07.397
Is there any way you can stay tonight?

43:07.560 --> 43:09.153
All night?

43:10.240 --> 43:14.917
Baby girl Mitchell's off the life support and I want to see it through with her mother.

43:15.080 --> 43:16.514
<i>Oh, God.</i>

43:16.680 --> 43:18.558
<i>I really can't, Sally.</i>

43:18.720 --> 43:20.200
It's OK.

43:20.360 --> 43:22.955
<i>I'm sorry, I have to leave by nine at the latest.</i>

43:23.840 --> 43:25.240
OK.

43:36.640 --> 43:38.836
<i>Are you sure it's him and not a hoax?</i>

43:39.000 --> 43:40.400
I think it's him.

43:40.560 --> 43:42.438
Expressing remorse?

43:42.600 --> 43:46.879
Yes, remorse, just not about the murder itself, as Ian Kay would like to think.

43:47.040 --> 43:48.793
Then what?

43:49.640 --> 43:51.597
He spent the most time with Sarah Kay.

43:51.760 --> 43:54.832
He posed her carefully, painted her nails, did her hair.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.798
Everything perfect.

43:56.960 --> 43:58.838
Probably took photographs,

43:59.000 --> 44:00.992
beautiful photographs.

44:01.640 --> 44:03.996
Then he heard the news that she was pregnant.

44:04.160 --> 44:08.234
I believe him when he says that he wouldn't have killed a pregnant woman.

44:09.200 --> 44:10.998
That has a ring of truth.

44:11.920 --> 44:14.913
So remorse that his perfect kill had been tainted...

44:15.640 --> 44:16.994
spoiled?

44:17.160 --> 44:18.276
Mm.

44:18.440 --> 44:20.432
What about this Ian Kay appeal?

44:23.240 --> 44:24.993
I think it'd give the killer pleasure,

44:26.040 --> 44:28.032
an opportunity to gloat.

44:29.360 --> 44:31.352
But it could be invaluable to us.

44:32.880 --> 44:35.793
It could open up a line of communication between us.

45:17.280 --> 45:19.272
I've never been up here.

45:20.680 --> 45:24.276
I twisted Ferrington's arm. She told me where you were.

45:25.840 --> 45:27.832
It's a good place to clear the head.

45:29.640 --> 45:31.279
I just wanted to say thank you.

45:32.600 --> 45:34.080
For your help.

45:34.240 --> 45:36.232
- I didn't do anything.
- Yes...

45:37.760 --> 45:39.274
..you did.

45:41.600 --> 45:43.080
I froze.

45:46.080 --> 45:48.072
I've never done that before.

45:52.520 --> 45:54.512
I should have seen it coming.

45:57.320 --> 46:00.040
A man...eaten up with guilt...

46:01.680 --> 46:03.672
..in fear for his life...

46:05.080 --> 46:07.072
..about to lose his job...

46:07.880 --> 46:09.678
his reputation, his freedom...

46:11.160 --> 46:13.834
I should have had someone else in the room with me.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.832
We all make mistakes.

46:25.120 --> 46:27.112
I don't want to stop holding her.

46:29.080 --> 46:31.072
You don't have to.

46:35.200 --> 46:37.669
When you're ready, we can wash and dress her.

46:38.280 --> 46:40.272
Take some photos, if you like.

46:43.120 --> 46:44.713
Yes.

47:01.840 --> 47:04.116
- There's someone to see you, ma'am.
- Who?

47:04.280 --> 47:06.795
Rose Stagg, a friend of Professor Reed Smith.

47:35.320 --> 47:37.994
I spent years interviewing the victims of rape.

47:40.240 --> 47:44.837
I don't think anyone ever felt worse after talking to me about their experiences.

47:53.800 --> 47:57.077
I was in my last year of medical studies at the university.

47:59.080 --> 48:03.154
I already had a boyfriend when I met a guy in one of the student union bars.

48:05.120 --> 48:07.112
And he was a student too?

48:08.320 --> 48:09.800
I think so.

48:10.760 --> 48:12.274
<i>Literature?</i>

48:13.000 --> 48:14.992
<i>Maybe Queen's or Stranmillis.</i>

48:16.320 --> 48:18.596
<i>And how old was he, would you say?</i>

48:20.240 --> 48:22.232
<i>22, 23.</i>

48:24.200 --> 48:26.271
We spent a couple of nights together.

48:28.200 --> 48:30.192
What sort of sex did you have?

48:31.880 --> 48:33.872
The sort that went on all night.

48:35.240 --> 48:36.640
Rough?

48:36.800 --> 48:38.154
Yes.

48:38.320 --> 48:40.312
But tender too.

48:43.080 --> 48:45.072
But then a strange thing happened.

48:46.080 --> 48:48.072
We'd both been drinking.

48:49.520 --> 48:51.512
Maybe too much.

48:52.400 --> 48:54.392
We were in bed together.

48:57.440 --> 48:59.716
I woke to find his hands around my throat.

49:01.200 --> 49:02.793
Was he raping you?

49:02.960 --> 49:04.360
No.

49:05.520 --> 49:08.194
At first I couldn't work out what was happening.

49:09.040 --> 49:11.032
The look in his eyes was really cold.

49:12.320 --> 49:17.315
I started fighting him but I couldn't get his hands away from my throat.

49:20.840 --> 49:22.320
Take your time.

49:57.640 --> 50:01.350
- Stick the kettle on, I'm bursting.
- Want some music on?

50:48.200 --> 50:49.793
<i>The pain was acute.</i>

50:50.880 --> 50:53.076
<i>I felt as though my lungs would burst...</i>

50:53.960 --> 50:55.110
<i>my head.</i>

50:56.520 --> 50:58.079
<i>I was in total panic.</i>

50:59.640 --> 51:03.270
<i>I've never felt such strength in someone before or since.</i>

51:04.400 --> 51:06.232
How did you get away from him?

51:06.400 --> 51:08.198
I didn't.

51:09.200 --> 51:11.112
Suddenly I could breathe again.

51:12.040 --> 51:16.956
I was gasping for breath and his hands weren't around my neck any more.

51:19.080 --> 51:21.197
I felt like I'd returned from the dead.

51:22.920 --> 51:25.754
<i>He sort of...sat up...</i>

51:25.920 --> 51:27.798
<i>and came to.</i>

51:27.960 --> 51:29.838
<i>Was he aroused?</i>

51:30.000 --> 51:31.878
<i>Did he have an erection?</i>

51:32.040 --> 51:33.156
<i>Yes.</i>

51:35.360 --> 51:39.752
<i>He um...got up from the bed and stumbled away.</i>

51:42.440 --> 51:43.954
What happened then?

51:44.120 --> 51:45.998
I felt sick.

51:46.160 --> 51:47.913
I was sick.

51:48.080 --> 51:50.072
I lay down on the bed.

51:51.720 --> 51:53.712
I just laid there.

51:55.600 --> 51:57.592
I think I went to sleep.

52:06.880 --> 52:08.599
What the...

53:39.560 --> 53:42.632
I had bruises all over my neck and...

53:42.800 --> 53:47.192
marks from my fingernails where I'd tried to get his hands away from my throat.

53:49.080 --> 53:51.072
I was hoarse for days.

53:51.720 --> 53:53.473
I couldn't swallow.

53:54.120 --> 53:55.873
Did you meet with him again?

53:57.880 --> 53:59.280
Just once.

54:00.120 --> 54:01.998
Did he apologise?

54:02.160 --> 54:03.514
Yes.

54:03.680 --> 54:05.672
He did.

54:07.800 --> 54:10.918
Did he offer any kind of explanation for his behaviour?

54:13.560 --> 54:15.870
He said he wanted to know what it was like..

54:17.560 --> 54:20.234
..to make love to someone who was unconscious.

54:21.280 --> 54:22.794
Make love?

54:23.440 --> 54:24.669
Fuck.

56:13.880 --> 56:15.758
What you doing?

56:15.920 --> 56:17.912
- Here, you!

56:28.520 --> 56:29.715
Hello?

56:31.000 --> 56:32.992
- Hello?
- Be careful.

56:33.920 --> 56:35.957
And you haven't seen him since?

56:36.120 --> 56:37.474
No.

56:37.640 --> 56:39.711
- Even glimpsed him about town?
- No.

56:40.840 --> 56:43.674
And you know of him as Peter? Anything else?

56:43.840 --> 56:45.832
I know it seems crazy.

56:47.000 --> 56:50.391
Being in bed with a guy when you don't know anything about him,

56:50.560 --> 56:52.552
just his first name.

56:54.000 --> 56:55.878
I learnt my lesson.

56:57.360 --> 56:59.113
You're wanted, ma'am.

57:01.880 --> 57:03.553
It's urgent.
