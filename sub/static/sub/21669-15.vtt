<i>(Male Announcer)
Previously on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:03.000 --> 00:05.534
Tiffany, please give me your
jacket and leave Hell's Kitchen.

00:05.535 --> 00:07.514
(Announcer) Kimmie was devastated
by Tiffany's departure...

00:07.515 --> 00:09.616
That was my dude, man.
I know, that sucks.

00:09.617 --> 00:12.486
(Announcer) And aggravated
by Barbie's presence.

00:12.487 --> 00:14.621
Bitch is still here.

00:14.622 --> 00:16.756
(Announcer) But her spirits
were quickly lifted...

00:16.757 --> 00:18.592
♪ I'm gonna let it shine hey ♪

00:18.593 --> 00:20.393
(Announcer)
By a down-home challenge.

00:20.394 --> 00:21.695
Today each of you
will be reinventing

00:21.696 --> 00:24.197
a classic Southern dish.

00:24.198 --> 00:26.233
(Announcer) While some chefs...

00:26.234 --> 00:28.301
I don't know how, but I better
figure it out real damn quick.

00:28.302 --> 00:29.970
(Announcer) Struggled...

00:29.971 --> 00:31.238
I've never made grits,
so I'm reading the box.

00:31.239 --> 00:32.339
(Announcer) Kimmie...

00:32.340 --> 00:33.874
Ain't nobody had grits
like mine, let me tell you.

00:33.875 --> 00:35.375
(Announcer) Was in her element.

00:35.376 --> 00:36.810
Wow.
Best grits I've ever had.

00:36.811 --> 00:38.778
I could eat just buckets
full of that.

00:38.779 --> 00:40.213
(Announcer) As she helped
secure a red team victory...

00:40.214 --> 00:41.214
Congratulations.

00:41.215 --> 00:42.549
Yeah!
Yeah!

00:42.550 --> 00:45.819
We finally won a reward!

00:45.820 --> 00:48.455
(Announcer) At dinner service, chef
Ramsay found Brian's performance...

00:48.456 --> 00:50.056
Tastes like fish, chef.

00:50.057 --> 00:51.791
<i>You wanna be funny now, do you?
No.</i>

00:51.792 --> 00:53.760
(Announcer)
Anything but amusing.

00:53.761 --> 00:55.929
Hey comedian, crack a joke now.
I [bleep] dare you.

00:55.930 --> 00:57.063
(Announcer) And Robyn...

00:57.064 --> 00:58.832
Raw!
Really?

00:58.833 --> 01:01.201
(Announcer) Scored no points
with her teammates...

01:01.202 --> 01:02.736
Just send her out of here,
please.

01:02.737 --> 01:03.537
(Announcer) Or chef Ramsay.

01:03.538 --> 01:05.405
All of you, get out!

01:05.406 --> 01:06.806
(Announcer)
In the red kitchen...

01:06.807 --> 01:07.774
Hey, taste that.
Ugh.

01:07.775 --> 01:09.843
Salt, salt.
You can't season food.

01:09.844 --> 01:11.611
(Announcer)
Barbie came up short.

01:11.612 --> 01:13.914
She [bleep] up again.
Barbie, go home.

01:13.915 --> 01:15.982
(Announcer) And Kimmie
disappointed her team...

01:15.983 --> 01:17.484
You're supposed to be
from the South.

01:17.485 --> 01:18.952
Kimmie, that's burnt.

01:18.953 --> 01:20.587
(Announcer) And herself.

01:20.588 --> 01:22.289
This is the first service
I [bleep]ed up.

01:22.290 --> 01:24.891
You, you, you, you, get out.

01:24.892 --> 01:26.860
You're a disgrace.

01:26.861 --> 01:29.229
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay
gave both teams a mission.

01:29.230 --> 01:31.197
Come up with one individual
from each team

01:31.198 --> 01:33.266
<i>that should be leaving
Hell's Kitchen.</i>

01:33.267 --> 01:34.734
(Aouncer) The red team nominated...
Kimmie.

01:34.735 --> 01:36.503
The blue team nominated...
Robyn.

01:36.504 --> 01:38.004
(Announcer) Robyn gave
a passionate plea.

01:38.005 --> 01:39.873
I'm not ready to go, chef.
I'm not ready to go.

01:39.874 --> 01:40.907
(Announcer) And it worked as...

01:40.908 --> 01:42.676
Kimmie.

01:42.677 --> 01:45.011
(Announcer) Lost her jacket and
her chance to become head chef

01:45.012 --> 01:47.764
at Gordon Ramsay Steak
at Paris, Las Vegas.

02:47.742 --> 02:49.042
Get out of here.

02:49.043 --> 02:50.710
<i>Mac and cheese
and fried chicken.</i>

02:50.711 --> 02:52.145
I mean, do me a favor.

02:52.146 --> 02:53.847
I think Robyn
was very close tonight

02:53.848 --> 02:55.248
to getting eliminated.

02:55.249 --> 02:57.217
She's gotta bounce back
next service.

02:57.218 --> 02:59.486
Bottom line, Robyn, get
your head out of your [bleep].

02:59.487 --> 03:00.920
[Sighs]

03:00.921 --> 03:04.290
I thought
I was going home, bro.

03:04.291 --> 03:07.527
I've been there many times.
I know.

03:07.528 --> 03:09.529
Usually it's three strikes,
you're out.

03:09.530 --> 03:11.598
And I feel like I am out
of chances right now,

03:11.599 --> 03:13.600
but how the [bleep]
do you bounce back

03:13.601 --> 03:16.503
after a service like tonight?

03:19.707 --> 03:21.841
Well, they got four.
We got three.

03:21.842 --> 03:23.643
Let's [bleep]ing do it, man.

03:23.644 --> 03:24.944
Sometimes less people
in the kitchen is better.

03:24.945 --> 03:26.379
<i>Three?
I don't give a [bleep].</i>

03:26.380 --> 03:27.914
I don't give a [bleep], we h...

03:27.915 --> 03:29.716
we'll do it 'cause we have to.

03:29.717 --> 03:32.881
A three-person team
is hard enough as it is.

03:32.882 --> 03:36.685
A three-person team with Barbie?
Meh.

03:36.686 --> 03:41.623
You know, it'd be nicer if
it were just me and Christina.

03:41.624 --> 03:43.425
<i>(Christina) Let's get it done.</i>

03:47.763 --> 03:50.899
(Announcer) With a new
day in Hell's Kitchen,

03:50.900 --> 03:53.702
both teams are hoping
to remove the stench

03:53.703 --> 03:54.803
from last night's
dinner service.

03:56.739 --> 03:58.139
We're all gonna be
on our "A" game today.

03:58.140 --> 03:59.274
It's on.

03:59.275 --> 04:02.544
It's on like Donkey Kong.

04:02.545 --> 04:03.545
Good morning.

04:03.546 --> 04:05.380
(All) Morning, chef.

04:05.381 --> 04:09.084
This next challenge will not
only test your cooking skills

04:09.085 --> 04:12.020
but your communication as well.

04:12.021 --> 04:14.155
As a team,
you'll have 30 minutes

04:14.156 --> 04:16.524
to cook me
three stunning dishes

04:16.524 --> 04:19.728
from our regular menu.

04:19.728 --> 04:21.396
<i>Here's the catch.</i>

04:21.397 --> 04:24.532
Only one of you will be
in the kitchen at any one time.

04:24.533 --> 04:27.969
When you get in the kitchen,
you'll be cooking five minutes.

04:27.970 --> 04:30.905
Then when the five minutes are
up, the next chef will come in.

04:30.906 --> 04:34.142
I'm giving you 15 seconds
to communicate with each other.

04:34.143 --> 04:37.045
And the second person
continues cooking

04:37.046 --> 04:40.181
where the first person
left off.

04:40.182 --> 04:43.418
The team with the most accurate
dishes wins the challenge.

04:43.419 --> 04:45.286
It should be easy.

04:45.287 --> 04:49.023
It should be like, pop.

Okay, Justin and Dana,
come with me into the kitchen.

04:59.873 --> 05:00.924
Let's go.

05:00.925 --> 05:02.737
(Announcer) In today's
communication relay challenge,

05:02.738 --> 05:04.739
each team must prepare
three dishes

05:04.740 --> 05:06.641
from the regular
Hell's Kitchen menu.

05:06.642 --> 05:08.410
Yeah?
Three stunning dishes.

05:08.411 --> 05:11.145
First one is risotto.
Second one, the lamb.

05:11.146 --> 05:11.846
Third one is the cod.

05:11.847 --> 05:13.214
Okay.
Okay?

05:13.215 --> 05:14.449
30 minutes.

05:14.450 --> 05:16.618
Your first five minutes
starts from...

05:16.619 --> 05:17.919
Now. Go.
Let's go.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.854
<i>Let's go, let's go, let's go.</i>

05:19.855 --> 05:21.990
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay has
selected these three dishes

05:21.991 --> 05:23.591
because they have
vastly different

05:23.592 --> 05:24.526
cooking times and techniques.

05:24.527 --> 05:26.528
<i>Come on, Just.
Come on, J.</i>

05:26.529 --> 05:28.763
(Announcer) It is vital that
the first chef on each team

05:28.764 --> 05:31.199
has a strong game plan
that begins

05:31.200 --> 05:33.368
with which items
to start cooking.

05:33.369 --> 05:35.203
You're good, Dana.
You're good.

05:35.204 --> 05:36.805
My first thought is the lamb,
and we have the cod.

05:36.806 --> 05:38.540
The cod doesn't take that long.

05:38.541 --> 05:40.208
It takes, like,
eight minutes altogether,

05:40.209 --> 05:43.144
so I know immediately
that lamb is

05:43.145 --> 05:44.946
the absolute first thing
I have to work on.

05:44.947 --> 05:46.881
(Both) Come on, Dana.

05:46.882 --> 05:48.983
Three minutes gone.
Two minutes to go.

05:48.984 --> 05:49.984
Come on, just.

05:49.985 --> 05:51.386
I just wanna make sure

05:51.387 --> 05:52.454
everything's together
for Clemenza.

05:52.455 --> 05:53.721
[Bleep]

05:53.722 --> 05:55.223
And then I turned around,

05:55.224 --> 05:56.391
and I realized
the risotto was raw.

05:56.392 --> 05:58.226
45 seconds to go.

05:58.227 --> 05:59.461
[Bleep] hell.

05:59.462 --> 06:01.296
So I opened it up and put it

06:01.297 --> 06:02.730
as close to the stove as
possible so that the next person

06:02.731 --> 06:04.466
coming would get it going
right away.

06:04.467 --> 06:08.169
(Gordon) Five, four,
three, two, one.

06:08.170 --> 06:10.405
<i>Clemenza, Christina, let's go.</i>

06:10.406 --> 06:12.207
(Announcer) Now the departing
chefs will have only 15 seconds

06:12.208 --> 06:13.475
to down-low
the incoming chefs...

06:13.476 --> 06:14.809
What do you got?

06:14.810 --> 06:16.911
The lamb is in the oven.
It just went in right now.

06:16.912 --> 06:19.280
All your sauces are on.
Stock... oh.

06:19.281 --> 06:21.049
(Announcer)
On what the dishes are...

06:21.050 --> 06:22.784
You gotta get the cod
and the risotto.

06:22.785 --> 06:24.719
(Announcer) And what
still needs to be done.

06:24.720 --> 06:25.453
The risotto's dead raw, so we
gotta cook that from scratch.

06:25.454 --> 06:26.788
Okay.

06:26.789 --> 06:28.723
(Announcer) To ensure
that all the dishes

06:28.724 --> 06:30.291
will be completed
in the time allotted.

06:30.292 --> 06:31.526
And all the garnishes
are right there.

06:31.527 --> 06:32.527
Out.

06:32.528 --> 06:33.962
I didn't get to the fish yet.

06:33.963 --> 06:36.865
<i>(Gordon) Get out, Dana.</i>

06:38.367 --> 06:40.869
He's gotta move faster.
[Sighs]

06:40.870 --> 06:42.937
He's gotta go faster now.

06:42.938 --> 06:44.739
(Robyn) Clemenza's sitting there,
[bleep]ing with his apron,

06:44.740 --> 06:46.107
and that's not the priority.

06:46.108 --> 06:47.709
Clemenza needs to get
a firecracker up his [bleep]

06:47.710 --> 06:49.410
and run faster.

06:49.411 --> 06:50.745
(Gordon) Let's go, Clemenza.
Come on.

06:50.746 --> 06:52.480
Yes, chef.

06:52.481 --> 06:54.382
Ah, [bleep].

06:54.383 --> 06:56.851
I wish that Dana told me
that the risotto was raw.

06:56.852 --> 06:59.621
I have to get that risotto
started right away

06:59.622 --> 07:01.756
because it's going to take
about 15, 20 minutes.

07:01.757 --> 07:04.058
Two and a half minutes gone.
Two and a half minutes to go.

07:05.394 --> 07:07.395
The risotto needs to be cooked.
Hello!

07:07.396 --> 07:09.330
But you wanna blanch
a bok choy?

07:09.331 --> 07:11.466
We need to start
the [bleep] risotto.

07:11.467 --> 07:14.769
<i>(Gordon) Three, two, one.
Let's go.</i>

07:14.770 --> 07:16.638
(Announcer)
Only 20 minutes remain.

07:16.639 --> 07:18.573
And after a quick conference
with Clemenza...

07:18.574 --> 07:20.174
Gotta get the risotto up
first thing.

07:20.175 --> 07:21.309
Get the risotto cooked.
It is raw.

07:21.310 --> 07:22.377
(Announcer) And Christina.

07:22.378 --> 07:23.611
The risotto
was not even blanched,

07:23.612 --> 07:24.178
<i>so I have it working
with veg stock.</i>

07:24.179 --> 07:25.480
Okay.

07:25.481 --> 07:27.615
(Announcer) Barbie and
Brian get to work,

07:27.616 --> 07:29.918
trying to make sense
of the chaos in the kitchen.

07:29.919 --> 07:32.287
Stock's not on.
Sauce isn't on.

07:32.288 --> 07:34.589
I honestly don't know
what got done.

07:34.590 --> 07:37.358
Risotto's on.
Poof.

07:37.359 --> 07:39.460
15 seconds to go.

07:39.461 --> 07:41.262
15 seconds to go.

07:41.263 --> 07:46.200
Four, three, two, one.
Switch.

07:46.201 --> 07:48.736
(Announcer) It's the fourth round of
the communication relay challenge,

07:48.737 --> 07:51.406
and while Dana
tries to get her bearings,

07:51.407 --> 07:53.942
Robyn goes to work on the cod.

07:53.943 --> 07:55.043
[Bleep]

07:55.044 --> 07:56.611
Did you burn the first portion?

07:56.612 --> 07:57.979
I didn't.
The pan was too hot.

07:57.980 --> 07:59.180
Did you burn it?
Yes or no.

07:59.181 --> 08:00.281
Yes, chef.
The pan was too hot.

08:00.282 --> 08:00.949
[Bleep] me.
The pan was too hot.

08:00.950 --> 08:02.317
She burnt the cod.

08:02.318 --> 08:03.885
Come on, Robyn.
Just hold it together.

08:03.886 --> 08:05.420
I'm not worried about it.
I got it, guys.

08:05.421 --> 08:07.689
Now I'm trying to stay calm
because Justin's up next

08:07.690 --> 08:09.724
and then followed by me,
so I'm thinking us two...

08:09.725 --> 08:11.326
with ten minutes left,
no matter what...

08:11.327 --> 08:12.126
should be able to pull it off.

08:12.127 --> 08:13.294
Tongs.

08:13.295 --> 08:14.462
Come on, Dana.
What are you looking for?

08:14.463 --> 08:15.263
<i>Tongs.</i>

08:15.264 --> 08:16.998
I got them.
I got them.

08:16.999 --> 08:18.366
Come on, Dana. You got it girl.
Come on, Dana.

08:18.367 --> 08:19.767
Dana's running
all around the kitchen.

08:19.768 --> 08:21.436
She definitely seems
kind of frantic.

08:21.437 --> 08:23.338
I don't think she accomplished
very much.

08:23.339 --> 08:25.340
It's really frustrating.

08:25.341 --> 08:27.842
<i>(Gordon) Three, two, one.
Switch.</i>

08:27.843 --> 08:29.777
Don't worry about it.

08:29.778 --> 08:32.313
(Announcer) With just two rounds
and ten minutes remaining...

08:32.313 --> 08:34.515
Risotto's still working, I'm
trying to push stuff up here.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.083
I'm trying to get
all garnish in the pan.

08:36.085 --> 08:38.052
(Announcer) Good communication
in the kitchens is critical.

08:38.053 --> 08:39.721
The risotto's almost done,
okay?

08:39.722 --> 08:41.356
Wait, what else,
what else, what else?

08:41.357 --> 08:43.224
And that's it.
All the garnish is right there.

08:43.225 --> 08:45.293
Robyn was pretty much useless
when it came to communication.

08:45.294 --> 08:46.828
<i>(Gordon) Out.</i>

08:46.829 --> 08:48.329
I was just like, you know what?
Whatever then.

08:48.330 --> 08:49.664
At that point, you can just go,

08:49.665 --> 08:50.732
and I'll just
figure it out myself.

08:50.733 --> 08:51.699
When I get to the risotto,

08:51.700 --> 08:53.267
it's already burning
on the bottom.

08:53.268 --> 08:55.003
Dana had the stove too hot.

08:55.004 --> 08:56.471
Come on, Christina.

08:56.472 --> 08:58.039
I'm a little pissed
that we're not, uh,

08:58.040 --> 08:59.540
a little bit
better-organized.

08:59.541 --> 09:01.242
Last two minutes.
Let's go, Justin.

09:01.243 --> 09:02.577
Yes, chef.

09:02.578 --> 09:04.679
First thing I feel is the lamb.
It's dead raw.

09:04.680 --> 09:05.980
I threw that into the oven.
The cod... that's dead raw.

09:05.981 --> 09:07.181
I launched that into the oven.

09:07.182 --> 09:08.516
45 seconds.

09:08.517 --> 09:11.519
Man, man.
It's just mass chaos.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.988
You got this, Justin.

09:13.989 --> 09:15.657
Make sure you check that cod.

09:15.658 --> 09:17.659
Christina pulled the cod
out of the oven

09:17.660 --> 09:19.027
before it was ready.

09:19.028 --> 09:22.563
Three, two, one.
Change. Let's go.

09:22.564 --> 09:24.399
(Announcer)
It's the final round,

09:24.400 --> 09:25.967
and the chefs
will have one last chance...

09:25.968 --> 09:28.336
Garnish...
garnish is all there.

09:28.337 --> 09:30.638
(Announcer) To quickly communicate
what's going on in their kitchens.

09:30.639 --> 09:32.473
Fish in the oven here.
The lamb's in the oven there.

09:32.474 --> 09:33.608
Here's your garnish
right there.

09:33.609 --> 09:35.009
It's gotta go here.

09:35.010 --> 09:37.078
Justin... [Speaks in gibberish]
Like that.

09:37.079 --> 09:39.414
I'm like, "What the [bleep]
did you just say, dude?"

09:39.415 --> 09:40.515
Fish is over there, and all
the garnishes are right there.

09:40.516 --> 09:42.050
<i>(Gordon) Out.</i>

09:42.051 --> 09:43.651
I have no idea what he said.

09:43.652 --> 09:44.919
[Bleep]ing kidding me, man?
Come on.

09:44.920 --> 09:46.587
(Announcer)
And with time running out,

09:46.588 --> 09:49.223
both chefs race to finish off
and plate the dishes.

09:49.224 --> 09:51.159
Clemenza, Barbie,
start plating.

09:51.160 --> 09:52.694
Garlic shallots.
Garlic shallots.

09:52.695 --> 09:54.095
I still have to grab plates.

09:54.096 --> 09:55.830
I still have to slice the meat.

09:55.831 --> 09:57.465
I still have to find
all of the garnishes.

09:57.466 --> 09:59.200
Some are here.
Some are there.

09:59.201 --> 10:01.769
It's just a hot mess.

10:01.770 --> 10:02.970
A hot mess.

10:02.971 --> 10:05.573
You gotta plate now.
Gotta plate.

10:05.574 --> 10:08.609
I'm watching Clemenza, and he's
not plating fast enough.

10:08.610 --> 10:10.878
And at this point, I'm just
like, there's no [bleep]ing way.

10:10.879 --> 10:12.213
Come on, come on, come on,
come one, come on.

10:12.214 --> 10:13.448
<i>(Gordon) 30 seconds to go.</i>

10:13.449 --> 10:15.183
Come on, Barbie.

10:15.184 --> 10:17.985
It's hard, having to step back
and watch, like...

10:17.986 --> 10:19.787
Just start plating!

10:19.788 --> 10:21.823
Put the risotto on the plate.
Put the risotto on the plate.

10:21.824 --> 10:25.760
<i>(Gordon) Five, four,
three, two, one.</i>

10:25.761 --> 10:27.762
<i>And stop.
[Bleep]</i>

10:34.971 --> 10:36.738
(Announcer)
With time running out

10:36.739 --> 10:38.540
in the communication
relay challenge...

10:38.541 --> 10:40.308
Put the risotto on the plate.
Put the risotto on the plate.

10:40.309 --> 10:42.210
(Announcer) The anchor chefs,
Clemenza and Barbie,

10:42.211 --> 10:44.179
scramble to get their dishes
to the pass.

10:44.180 --> 10:46.648
<i>(Gordon) Five, four, three...</i>

10:46.649 --> 10:47.983
[Bleep]

10:47.984 --> 10:52.287
<i>(Gordon) Two, one.
And stop.</i>

10:52.288 --> 10:53.722
[Sighs]

10:53.723 --> 10:57.058
I mean, honestly, I'm
physically, mentally exhausted.

10:57.059 --> 10:58.793
Lot harder than it looks.

10:58.794 --> 11:00.795
(Announcer) With the
cooking now complete,

11:00.796 --> 11:03.732
chef Ramsay will determine
which team was more precise

11:03.733 --> 11:06.634
with the three assigned dishes
from the Hell's Kitchen menu.

11:06.635 --> 11:08.660
Let's go.
Uh, risottos.

11:10.940 --> 11:11.940
<i>Wow.</i>

11:11.941 --> 11:14.576
I mean, honestly, come on.

11:14.577 --> 11:16.711
(Clemenza) A football-looking
pile of [bleep].

11:16.712 --> 11:18.646
A frisbee-looking pile
of [bleep].

11:18.647 --> 11:22.617
Add a little garnish
on that little pile of [bleep].

11:24.520 --> 11:26.054
Taste that.

11:26.055 --> 11:28.456
Chef has yet to make
everyone taste a dish

11:28.457 --> 11:30.058
because it's so delicious.

11:30.059 --> 11:31.559
<i>(Gordon) It tastes smoky</i>

11:31.560 --> 11:33.061
'cause it's burnt.

11:39.268 --> 11:40.602
Crunchy.

11:40.603 --> 11:42.404
We should've dropped
the risotto right away,

11:42.405 --> 11:43.838
but I didn't.

11:43.839 --> 11:45.940
Justin forgot it as well
the first time,

11:45.941 --> 11:47.175
so I mean, [bleep] happens.

11:47.176 --> 11:48.744
The point goes to...

11:50.112 --> 11:52.313
None of you.

11:52.314 --> 11:54.717
Are you kidding me?

11:54.718 --> 11:58.119
(Announcer) With both teams off to
a poor start on dish number one...

11:58.120 --> 11:59.954
Next dish, cod.

11:59.955 --> 12:01.756
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay is
hoping for a better execution

12:01.757 --> 12:04.592
of the fish entree.

12:04.593 --> 12:05.727
Clemenza, what's missing?

12:05.728 --> 12:07.429
The dashi broth.

12:07.430 --> 12:08.630
Come on, Clemenza.

12:08.631 --> 12:10.598
Bad choice to put him last.

12:14.804 --> 12:16.004
Raw.

12:16.005 --> 12:18.573
Christina [bleep]ed it up.

12:18.574 --> 12:20.542
No surprise there.

12:20.543 --> 12:22.944
The point goes to none of you.
That's embarrassing.

12:22.945 --> 12:25.080
(Announcer)
While this difficult challenge

12:25.081 --> 12:27.248
has resulted in neither team
on the scoreboard...

12:27.249 --> 12:29.250
Zero-zero.
Wow.

12:29.251 --> 12:31.419
(Announcer) The final
lamb dish will determine

12:31.420 --> 12:33.421
the winner of the challenge.

12:33.422 --> 12:35.657
(Clemenza) Our lamb is nicely cooked.
The sauce is on.

12:35.658 --> 12:40.662
We got this, we got this,
we got this.

12:40.663 --> 12:42.230
Ugh.

12:42.231 --> 12:44.199
<i>[Bleep].
Wow, ugh.</i>

12:44.200 --> 12:45.767
Yeah, we're [bleep]ed.

12:45.768 --> 12:47.635
<i>(Gordon)
The sauce is disgusting.</i>

12:47.636 --> 12:49.003
It's like something
out of a gas station.

12:49.004 --> 12:51.039
<i>Nasty.</i>

12:51.040 --> 12:52.740
Okay, well this
could be good for us.

12:52.741 --> 12:55.510
I mean, our lamb
is cooked perfectly.

12:55.511 --> 12:58.680
<i>Red team.</i>

12:58.681 --> 13:00.582
I sliced the lamb, chef.
I apologize.

13:00.583 --> 13:02.951
You sliced the lamb,
or you chewed the lamb?

13:02.952 --> 13:05.253
Barbie, what have you done
to this lamb?

13:05.254 --> 13:08.223
Did you cut it
with a [bleep]ing spoon?

13:08.224 --> 13:12.026
Ugh.

13:12.027 --> 13:13.228
<i>Wow.</i>

13:13.229 --> 13:16.231
I am seriously disappointed.

13:16.232 --> 13:18.800
I expected,
at this stage in the game,

13:18.801 --> 13:21.636
something so much better.

13:21.637 --> 13:24.772
For the first time ever

13:24.773 --> 13:28.376
<i>in Hell's Kitchen history,</i>

13:28.377 --> 13:33.581
I, Gordon Ramsay,
cannot pick a winner.

13:33.582 --> 13:35.383
<i>Red team, blue team...</i>

13:35.384 --> 13:37.585
You both lost.

13:37.586 --> 13:41.523
One team would've had
an amazing day.

13:41.524 --> 13:43.057
The beach in Santa Monica,

13:43.058 --> 13:45.927
visiting Malibu
in the helicopter.

13:45.928 --> 13:48.296
<i>You had a beach club
this afternoon</i>

13:48.297 --> 13:50.198
for yourselves.

13:50.199 --> 13:55.236
<i>Hell's Kitchen, season ten,
making history.</i>

13:55.237 --> 13:58.740
Only we're making history
because we suck.

13:58.741 --> 14:01.176
You have a long day cleaning.

14:01.177 --> 14:03.978
The front of Hell's Kitchen
needs sprucing up.

14:03.979 --> 14:08.349
After that, Hell's Kitchen
SUVs needs detailing.

14:08.350 --> 14:11.686
But more importantly, I'm
opening Hell's Kitchen tonight.

14:11.687 --> 14:13.321
Yes, chef.
Yes, chef.

14:13.322 --> 14:15.089
<i>Do you know why?
Redemption.</i>

14:15.090 --> 14:18.126
<i>You need it.
I swear to God.</i>

14:18.127 --> 14:19.460
<i>It's gonna be a great service,</i>

14:19.461 --> 14:20.795
'cause if it's not,

14:20.796 --> 14:22.630
<i>I am not waiting till the end
of service</i>

14:22.631 --> 14:23.631
to get rid of dead wood.

14:23.632 --> 14:26.734
[Bleep].

14:26.735 --> 14:28.736
Get cleaning.
Let's go, guys.

14:28.737 --> 14:30.672
Chef's pissed,
and you know what?

14:30.673 --> 14:32.707
He's right to be pissed.
We should all be embarrassed

14:32.708 --> 14:34.876
to be wearing these jackets
right now.

14:34.877 --> 14:36.444
Come on, C.

14:36.445 --> 14:38.446
Hi, guys.
Hi, James.

14:38.447 --> 14:40.381
By the way, that's the car
that was taking you

14:40.382 --> 14:40.915
<i>to your private beach
for the day.</i>

14:40.916 --> 14:41.950
Wow.

14:41.951 --> 14:43.551
Aw, man.

14:43.552 --> 14:45.887
Would've been [bleep] pimp
to rode down Malibu

14:45.888 --> 14:48.656
in that red car,
lay on the beach,

14:48.657 --> 14:52.393
have some drinks,
and just relax by the pool.

14:52.394 --> 14:54.028
Why couldn't we just win today,

14:54.029 --> 14:55.129
so we could've been
at the beach?

14:55.130 --> 14:56.264
<i>(James) Enough about that</i>

14:56.265 --> 14:57.632
'cause that's all
winners' stuff,

14:57.633 --> 14:59.033
and we're a bunch of losers
at the moment.

14:59.034 --> 15:00.301
<i>So we're gonna clean.</i>

15:00.302 --> 15:01.236
All right, guys.
Let's go.

15:01.237 --> 15:02.737
(All) Yes.

15:02.738 --> 15:04.872
(Announcer) For the first
time in Hell's Kitchen,

15:04.873 --> 15:06.307
there will be two teams
doing punishment.

15:06.308 --> 15:08.243
Hello?
You guys need to shut the door

15:08.244 --> 15:10.044
<i>'cause I'm cleaning the car.</i>

15:10.045 --> 15:11.145
No, well, we gotta clean
the inside first.

15:11.146 --> 15:12.113
(Announcer)
And Robyn quickly...

15:12.114 --> 15:13.648
You guys wanna go
on the inside,

15:13.649 --> 15:15.483
you need to shut
the [bleep]ing door.

15:15.484 --> 15:17.719
(Announcer) Has the blue team wishing
she was still on the red team.

15:17.720 --> 15:19.721
Clemenza, please shut the door.

15:19.722 --> 15:21.022
Can you give me a second?

15:21.023 --> 15:23.391
No.

15:23.392 --> 15:25.126
Right off the bat,
Robyn's going nuts

15:25.127 --> 15:26.995
and telling everybody
what to do.

15:26.996 --> 15:28.730
Put this bucket right
in between these two cars.

15:28.731 --> 15:30.398
The bucket should be
on the other side.

15:30.399 --> 15:31.699
Step off.
Back up.

15:31.700 --> 15:32.967
Like, come on.
Get over yourself.

15:32.968 --> 15:34.135
Don't dirty the car inside.

15:34.136 --> 15:35.470
Shut the [bleep]...

15:35.471 --> 15:37.544
Yeah, really, I know.
Shut the [bleep] up.

15:40.109 --> 15:42.810
(Barbie) Please don't whack
me with that nasty [bleep].

15:42.811 --> 15:46.347
Today is a perfect beach day.

15:46.348 --> 15:50.985
I don't wanna be
in Hell's Kitchen working.

15:50.986 --> 15:52.353
[Groans]

15:52.354 --> 15:54.922
Before you buck your knees,
let's, um,

15:54.923 --> 15:57.558
<i>sweep them off.
Polish the windows.</i>

15:57.559 --> 15:59.527
Because those windows
are not looking brilliant.

15:59.528 --> 16:02.297
It's definitely been
a long day, but, um,

16:02.298 --> 16:04.966
we're gonna bounce back
from today's challenge...

16:04.967 --> 16:07.969

Even before I lift the dome,

(Announcer) Has finally
delivered on his risotto.

23:44.080 --> 23:47.149
And now the pressure shifts
to Brian on the meat station

23:47.150 --> 23:48.818
as the blue team
moves on to entrees.

23:48.819 --> 23:50.686
Slicing new Yorks!

23:50.687 --> 23:52.354
Garnish.

23:52.355 --> 23:54.190
Brian, new Yorks!

23:54.191 --> 23:56.025
Garnish is on the plate!

23:56.026 --> 23:59.328
Okay.
Walking right now, chef.

23:59.329 --> 24:01.597
Behind you, chef.

24:01.598 --> 24:03.632
Check their slices.
What are they doing, huh?

24:03.633 --> 24:06.969
It's raw.
That's not rested.

24:06.970 --> 24:08.270
All of you, come here.

24:08.271 --> 24:09.438
[Bleep].

24:09.439 --> 24:12.007
What is this?
I got a hodgepodge.

24:12.008 --> 24:13.676
Needs more time, chef.

24:13.677 --> 24:16.378
[Bleep], we're raw, perfect,
and medium-rare,

24:16.379 --> 24:19.081
and sliced on
a [bleep]ing door wedge.

24:19.082 --> 24:20.316
Do you have any more, Bri?

24:20.317 --> 24:21.684
Stupid me.

24:21.685 --> 24:22.952
I know you're a stupid idiot,
but look at me.

24:22.953 --> 24:24.119
<i>How long?</i>

24:24.120 --> 24:25.588
Five minutes, chef.

24:25.589 --> 24:27.022
<i>I need two New York.</i>

24:27.023 --> 24:28.724
Robyn, come here.
You got cold mash.

24:28.725 --> 24:30.025
How can we just leave that
standing there?

24:30.026 --> 24:31.193
<i>We can't.</i>

24:31.194 --> 24:33.395
And clear that [bleep] off
of her plate.

24:33.396 --> 24:35.030
Brian is definitely crashing
right now.

24:35.031 --> 24:36.866
Him and his buddy Clemenza...

24:36.867 --> 24:39.335
I feel like that whole half
is sinking the blue team.

24:39.336 --> 24:41.203
Hold those sauces.
Feed the oven, come on.

24:41.204 --> 24:42.304
I got it.

24:42.305 --> 24:43.939
So I'm like,
"Dude, I got this."

24:43.940 --> 24:46.609
My ass is on top
of my garnish, chef.

24:46.610 --> 24:48.344
Two Wellington,
two New York strip. How long?

24:48.345 --> 24:50.045
Four minutes, chef.

24:50.046 --> 24:51.380
You okay with that, garnish?

24:51.381 --> 24:53.249
Yes, I got my garnish ready.

24:53.250 --> 24:54.917
She's got all her garnish
in the oven.

24:54.918 --> 24:58.554
Spinach is ready right here.

24:58.555 --> 25:00.422
Robyn, I just get nervous when
I see all this in here.

25:00.423 --> 25:01.690
They told me
to hold it in here.

25:01.691 --> 25:03.359
Who told you?
Who?

25:03.360 --> 25:06.128
My team did. They said
this was a holding oven.

25:06.129 --> 25:07.730
What?
You said it's a holding oven.

25:07.731 --> 25:08.964
No.
What?

25:08.965 --> 25:10.633
So is it [bleep]ing
better being

25:10.634 --> 25:13.969
held in [bleep]ing conditions,
or cooking fresh?

25:13.970 --> 25:15.070
Cooking fresh.

25:15.071 --> 25:16.772
<i>(Gordon) Hey, stop.</i>

25:16.773 --> 25:18.440
Who told her to put
all the garnish in the oven?

25:18.441 --> 25:21.143
You guys all did.
Do not sandbag me like this.

25:21.144 --> 25:22.878
No, we did not.
I didn't tell her that.

25:22.879 --> 25:24.146
<i>Don't lie.
That's not what we said.</i>

25:24.147 --> 25:25.681
<i>That's not what we said.
That's a lie.</i>

25:25.682 --> 25:27.950
You said, "Hold the garnish
in the oven as well."

25:27.951 --> 25:30.085
No, I did not.
I said, "Hold the sauce."

25:30.086 --> 25:31.487
<i>That's what said.</i>

25:31.488 --> 25:33.222
I don't lose my [bleep]
too often, man,

25:33.223 --> 25:34.823
but you're not gonna [bleep]ing
call me a liar

25:34.824 --> 25:35.991
or tell me I told you
to put spinach in the oven,

25:35.992 --> 25:37.226
try to make me look bad.

25:37.227 --> 25:38.761
[Bleep]ing take blame
for what you've done.

25:38.762 --> 25:39.862
You know, you're
a [bleep]ing idiot

25:39.863 --> 25:41.497
if you put spinach in the oven.

25:41.498 --> 25:42.965
That's not what we said.
That's a lie.

25:42.966 --> 25:44.400
<i>(Clemenza) All right, come on.
Focus, focus.</i>

25:44.401 --> 25:45.401
Bring it back together.

25:45.402 --> 25:47.002
Red team does things different.

25:47.003 --> 25:48.237
<i>They do everything a la minute.</i>

25:48.238 --> 25:49.038
Who cares
what the red team does?

25:49.039 --> 25:49.905
You're not on the red team.

25:49.906 --> 25:51.106
But you guys do it wrong.

25:51.107 --> 25:52.541
<i>Okay, then go back over there.</i>

25:52.542 --> 25:53.943
All right, all right,
all right, enough. Enough.

25:53.944 --> 25:55.644
You said hold the garnish
in the oven as well.

25:55.645 --> 25:57.546
<i>No, I did not. Enough.
Don't lie.</i>

25:57.547 --> 25:58.781
<i>You heard that, Robyn?
Justin, Justin.</i>

25:58.782 --> 26:00.809
<i>Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Come on.</i>

26:07.266 --> 26:10.168
(Announcer) It's an hour into
a respectable dinner service,

26:10.169 --> 26:12.437
but Robyn's shortcut
on the garnish station...

26:12.438 --> 26:14.038
Yes, chef.
Stop!

26:14.039 --> 26:15.740
Who told her to put
all the garnish in the oven?

26:15.741 --> 26:17.442
You guys all did.
Do not sandbag me like this.

26:17.443 --> 26:19.544
<i>(Brian) No, we did not.</i>

26:19.545 --> 26:21.679
(Announcer) Proves to be a major
setback for the blue team.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.081
You said, "Hold the garnish
in the oven" as well.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.083
<i>No, I did not.
Don't lie.</i>

26:25.084 --> 26:27.085
<i>(Clemenza) Lets go, let's go.
Come on.</i>

26:27.086 --> 26:28.519
(Announcer)
Now the question is,

26:28.520 --> 26:30.088
how fast can they recover?

26:30.089 --> 26:33.057
Bring it back together.
We got two and a half minutes.

26:33.058 --> 26:35.560
Three New York,
two Wellington, one bass.

26:35.561 --> 26:37.428
Listen, I'm going with
the fish right now.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.430
Give me Bri's garnish
in the window.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.232
<i>Follow me with two of those
strip, okay? Got it.</i>

26:41.233 --> 26:42.700
Slicing meat right now.

26:42.701 --> 26:44.335
<i>You heard that, Robyn?
Yes.</i>

26:44.336 --> 26:47.238
I'm making fresh spinach
right now, guys.

26:47.239 --> 26:48.673
Duh.

26:48.674 --> 26:50.875
It's not that difficult.
[Bleep]ing idiot.

26:50.876 --> 26:53.044
<i>Come on, let's go, let s go.
Let's don't give up.</i>

26:53.045 --> 26:55.613
<i>Just keep pushing, guys.
Come on, let's get it</i>

26:55.614 --> 26:56.981
"I got it," I said.

26:56.982 --> 26:58.650
<i>(Brian) Okay, bass is walking.</i>

26:58.651 --> 27:00.685
Behind... I'm walking
with the New York right now.

27:00.686 --> 27:02.553
[Bleep] sandbaggers.

27:02.554 --> 27:04.255
It's hot, chef.

27:04.256 --> 27:05.957
All right, let's go.
Get that garnish up.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.125
<i>Get everything up right now.</i>

27:07.126 --> 27:08.526
This one's [bleep]ed.

27:08.527 --> 27:10.862
Gray, dry.

27:10.863 --> 27:12.330
Come on, just keep pushing.

27:12.331 --> 27:15.366
Justin, hey you.
Come here, you.

27:15.367 --> 27:17.368
So he cooks
fresh New York strip

27:17.369 --> 27:20.171
'cause he screwed
the previous table,

27:20.172 --> 27:25.510
and you reheat the same bass?
And you think it's funny?

27:25.511 --> 27:28.246
No, I don't think it's funny.
I'm pissed right now.

27:28.247 --> 27:29.847
I don't think
it's funny at all.

27:29.848 --> 27:31.983
[Cackles] Justin's a dumbass.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.284
Are you kidding me?

27:33.285 --> 27:34.852
I think it's hilarious
right now.

27:34.853 --> 27:37.722
Justin, is that your best?

27:37.723 --> 27:38.756
Hey, is that your best?

27:38.757 --> 27:40.959
No, chef.
No.

27:40.960 --> 27:44.195
So all that time
you were cook...

27:45.698 --> 27:47.799
All that time you were cooking,
you couldn't think

27:47.800 --> 27:49.267
to put two fresh bass in?

27:49.268 --> 27:51.769
Chef, I wasn't thinking.
I'm sorry.

27:51.770 --> 27:54.672
I gotta refire these right now.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.074
What was I thinking?

27:56.075 --> 27:57.475
That was just a dumb,
dumb mistake.

27:57.476 --> 27:59.410
All of you, look at me.

27:59.411 --> 28:01.946
Wake up, wake up,
wake up, wake up.

28:01.947 --> 28:04.015
Sorry, chef.
Yes, chef.

28:04.016 --> 28:06.384
(Announcer) While it's
been an agonizing wait

28:06.385 --> 28:08.052
for the blue team's diners...

28:08.053 --> 28:10.021
Over an hour
and they're still not coming?

28:10.022 --> 28:11.322
<i>(Woman) Yeah, they're
taking way too long.</i>

28:11.323 --> 28:12.623
I give it 15 more minutes.

28:12.624 --> 28:14.158
<i>We'll go somewhere else.</i>

28:14.159 --> 28:16.194
Beautiful.
Service, please.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.562
You know where you're going,
yes?

28:17.563 --> 28:18.696
<i>(Woman) Enjoy.</i>

28:18.697 --> 28:21.165
(Announcer)
Diners on the red side...

28:21.166 --> 28:23.034
Are having
a pleasant experience.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.335
Enjoy your meal.

28:24.336 --> 28:25.603
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.

28:25.604 --> 28:27.171
Let's finish strong.

28:27.172 --> 28:29.207
(Announcer) The women are
firing on all cylinders...

28:29.208 --> 28:31.342
<i>(Dana)
Walking to the window now.</i>

28:31.343 --> 28:33.144
(Announcer) And are moving
quickly toward the finish line.

28:33.145 --> 28:34.479
Four Wellingtons, chef.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.047
Good job, girls.
Good job.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.082
<i>(Gordon) Wow. Service, please.</i>

28:38.083 --> 28:40.885
Barbie, those Wellingtons
are cooked perfectly.

28:40.886 --> 28:42.687
<i>I love it.
Good job, Barbie.</i>

28:42.688 --> 28:44.455
Let's go now.
Three sea bass, four Wellington.

28:44.456 --> 28:45.590
Yes, chef.

28:45.591 --> 28:47.392
Last ticket. Let's go.
How long?

28:47.393 --> 28:48.726
Three minutes, right?

28:48.727 --> 28:49.994
I may need to push it to four.

28:49.995 --> 28:51.429
<i>Are you okay resting?</i>

28:51.430 --> 28:53.398
<i>I'm okay resting.
All right.</i>

28:53.399 --> 28:54.665
Come on, let's go.

28:54.666 --> 28:56.267
<i>Dana, hey.</i>

28:56.268 --> 28:58.703
It's so much easier cooking
three bass in one large pan

28:58.704 --> 29:00.938
and using one pan on the stove
than three.

29:00.939 --> 29:02.840
Yes, chef.

29:02.841 --> 29:05.743
You're a smart girl, yet
common sense is not your forte.

29:05.744 --> 29:09.113
Honestly, I don't get you.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.885
Chef, I can do this.

29:13.886 --> 29:16.254
I don't need
your help right now.

29:16.255 --> 29:17.688
<i>(Gordon) You have so much more
control over cooking it in one pan.</i>

29:17.689 --> 29:19.457
<i>Yes, chef.</i>

29:19.458 --> 29:21.459
He's, like,
doing the same thing that

29:21.460 --> 29:23.127
I've been doing the whole time,
only he's doing it

29:23.128 --> 29:26.664
in a big sautee pan instead
of three little sautee pans.

29:26.665 --> 29:28.499
Wait till you see the difference
of using one pan for three bass.

29:28.500 --> 29:31.202
Thank you, chef.

29:31.203 --> 29:34.739
It's the same thing.
Tomatoes, "to-mah-toes," chef.

29:34.740 --> 29:36.140
<i>(Gordon) Let's go.</i>

29:36.141 --> 29:37.041
Right behind.
Right behind.

29:37.042 --> 29:38.476
Wellington, chef.

29:38.477 --> 29:39.510
Thank you, ladies.

29:39.511 --> 29:41.813
Service, please.

29:41.814 --> 29:44.615
<i>(Barbie) That's it.
Desserts and we're good.</i>

29:44.616 --> 29:46.984
(Announcer) While the red team celebrates
an excellent dinner service...

29:46.985 --> 29:48.486
Good job, guys.

29:48.487 --> 29:50.154
(Announcer)
Over in the blue kitchen...

29:50.155 --> 29:52.623
It's anything but a party.

29:52.624 --> 29:53.925
<i>(Brian) [bleep].</i>

29:53.926 --> 29:55.326
Come on.
[Bleep] over on one.

29:55.327 --> 29:56.661
Come on, Brian.
Son of a bitch.

29:56.662 --> 29:58.129
<i>Come on.
I'm over on one.</i>

29:58.130 --> 30:00.098
Three New York, two Wellington,
one bass. How long?

30:00.099 --> 30:01.432
Three minutes, chef.

30:01.433 --> 30:02.800
Drive the ticket.
Let's go.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.302
Yes, chef.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.070
It's still our first table,

30:06.071 --> 30:08.106
and all I want is...
is the ticket to be done.

30:08.107 --> 30:09.540
I just want it to be done,

30:09.541 --> 30:11.008
but everything
kept coming out wrong.

30:11.009 --> 30:12.977
<i>Come on, Bri.
Where's the bass?</i>

30:12.978 --> 30:14.412
You let me know when you're
ready, they're ready to go.

30:14.413 --> 30:15.847
Walk with your bass.

30:15.848 --> 30:17.248
<i>I'm slicing New York.
Yes, go, go, go.</i>

30:17.249 --> 30:18.883
<i>Make sure it's cooked.
Raw.</i>

30:18.884 --> 30:20.284
Ah, no, no, no, no, no.

30:20.285 --> 30:21.552
It needs time.
Needs more time.

30:21.553 --> 30:23.087
Go, get another one.
He's backed up.

30:23.088 --> 30:24.989
<i>He's gonna be dragging steak
at least two minutes.</i>

30:24.990 --> 30:26.624
Hold on, whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's not ready, it's not ready.

30:26.625 --> 30:28.192
It's still coming out wrong.

30:28.193 --> 30:30.027
<i>Are you serious?</i>

30:30.028 --> 30:33.164
Muppets!
[Bleep] hell.

30:38.604 --> 30:40.104
<i>(Gordon) Are you serious?</i>

30:40.105 --> 30:43.508
They're walking out.
Oh, my God.

30:43.509 --> 30:45.409
<i>Urgently,
where's the Wellington?</i>

30:45.410 --> 30:50.047
Okay, Welly's walking.
Welly's walking.

30:50.048 --> 30:52.617
Oh, [bleep] me.
Another overcooked Wellington.

30:52.618 --> 30:54.519
[Sighs] [bleep] hell.

30:54.520 --> 30:57.388
Honestly, I'm gonna go crazy.

30:57.389 --> 30:59.023
Overcooked Wellingtons.

30:59.024 --> 31:01.859
It's like a joke now.

31:01.860 --> 31:04.662
