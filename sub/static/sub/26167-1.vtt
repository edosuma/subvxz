Subtitles by explosiveskull

02:20.493 --> 02:26.889
My children and grandchildren
are starving.

02:26.891 --> 02:31.958
My people are starting to believe that
Freya has made the land infertile.

02:32.958 --> 02:35.323
And that I am cursed.

02:35.325 --> 02:38.825
So I think we should double
the number of sacrifices.

02:40.391 --> 02:41.890
What is this?

02:41.892 --> 02:43.456
Four failed harvests in a row.

02:43.458 --> 02:45.156
You're a failed harvest.

02:45.158 --> 02:47.457
Get away from me. You
should have been a farmer.

02:47.459 --> 02:50.459
If you wish to sacrifice girls
from your own tribe,

02:51.891 --> 02:54.890
then that's all the same to us.

02:54.892 --> 02:57.357
Your tribe is much larger
and more powerful.

02:57.359 --> 02:59.890
We've done our duty.

03:03.290 --> 03:04.858
More than enough.

03:10.158 --> 03:13.123
Why is there all this panic?

03:13.125 --> 03:17.926
In the past few years, our tribes
have had a lot of prosperity.

03:18.993 --> 03:20.989
What do you mean by that?

03:20.991 --> 03:23.926
That it will be even worse
the next few years?

03:26.326 --> 03:28.827
Freya gives and she takes.

03:29.992 --> 03:31.958
Sometimes a wonderful harvest.

03:33.126 --> 03:35.025
And sometimes a poor one.

03:37.426 --> 03:40.925
She has her cycle.
And we cannot change that.

03:42.125 --> 03:43.689
The spring tide

03:43.691 --> 03:47.393
has emptied my tribe's food plate for the
coming years. Something has to be done.

03:49.092 --> 03:53.290
That's easy for you to say, Odulf.
You don't have any daughters.

03:53.292 --> 03:55.789
My own sister
was sacrificed.

03:55.791 --> 03:58.325
But that didn't seem
to bother anyone.

04:00.791 --> 04:03.523
That's how
it has always been.

04:03.525 --> 04:05.956
That's how
our ancestors did it.

04:05.958 --> 04:08.090
Traditie.

04:08.092 --> 04:11.092
And that is how
your father did it too.

04:13.358 --> 04:16.291
Don't tell me you are
seriously considering this.

04:18.991 --> 04:20.289
I'm listening.

04:20.291 --> 04:23.255
But you should
say something instead.

04:23.257 --> 04:25.859
Does Redbad have
something to say as well?

04:29.225 --> 04:33.223
If no one else will.

04:33.225 --> 04:38.922
Apparently some people like to throw their
daughters into the fire to harvest more grain.

04:38.924 --> 04:42.389
Maybe we can spend our energy
into building new terpen.

04:42.391 --> 04:45.225
It is not really reassuring.

04:47.126 --> 04:51.726
That my brother's heir does not believe
in the customs of his own people.

04:53.159 --> 04:56.290
And one of those customs is that
anyone can say how they feel.

04:56.292 --> 05:00.160
Shall we not discuss
our bloodline here, Eibert?

05:01.059 --> 05:03.790
It's not about you.

05:03.792 --> 05:06.856
And it's not about me.
It's about our people.

05:06.858 --> 05:09.126
About the interest
of our nation.

05:15.859 --> 05:18.759
I do not force my will
upon free people.

05:20.525 --> 05:25.356
Everyone who wishes to participate
in the ritual is free to do so.

05:25.358 --> 05:27.359
Out of free will.

05:28.190 --> 05:29.191
I repeat:

05:30.325 --> 05:32.325
Out of free will.

06:10.124 --> 06:11.257
Arms up.

06:33.457 --> 06:35.191
Are you a Frank?

06:36.124 --> 06:37.822
Hey.

06:37.824 --> 06:40.222
You should all be working
a bit more,

06:40.224 --> 06:41.791
instead of praying.

06:57.790 --> 06:59.092
Redbad!

07:01.324 --> 07:03.324
- What are you doing?
- Redbad, no.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.692
- I love you.
- Yes.

07:09.058 --> 07:11.889
You're the son of Aldigisl.

07:11.891 --> 07:14.821
They will never let you
marry a girl like me.

07:14.823 --> 07:17.254
Without titles,
without a name.

07:17.256 --> 07:19.857
- I am going to take you away from here.
- And then?

07:20.791 --> 07:23.154
What kind of future
can we have?

07:23.156 --> 07:25.357
Do you want to run off
to an unknown land?

07:29.022 --> 07:30.823
Your place is here.

07:32.156 --> 07:33.724
And so is mine.

07:34.323 --> 07:35.723
No.

07:37.089 --> 07:39.388
I decide what I do
with my life.

07:39.390 --> 07:42.290
- They cannot force you to do this.
- No one is forcing me.

07:43.856 --> 07:47.455
- This is an honor for my family.
- Nonsense!

07:47.457 --> 07:50.158
Redbad!
I'm sorry.

07:51.457 --> 07:54.355
Eventually you would
have had to let her go.

07:54.357 --> 07:57.355
Redbad, these are the
sacrifices we have to make.

07:57.357 --> 08:00.055
Then let me go as well.

08:00.057 --> 08:03.691
You are the daughter of a king. You will
make plenty of sacrifices for your people.

08:05.890 --> 08:08.021
This is who we are.

08:08.023 --> 08:12.357
- Who I want you to be.
- I don't want to be like this.

08:36.256 --> 08:38.791
Mother of the sky
and the earth.

08:40.356 --> 08:42.789
Of fire and water.

08:43.822 --> 08:45.824
Of the springs and the trees.

08:46.790 --> 08:49.158
Of the animals and the grain.

08:52.089 --> 08:55.856
Mother of the ancestors.
and the children.

08:58.322 --> 09:00.356
Mother, lead me.

09:03.090 --> 09:05.354
Mother, feel me.

09:05.356 --> 09:07.791
Mother, see me.

09:09.355 --> 09:12.823
Mother, hear me!

09:50.189 --> 09:51.423
Now!

10:15.222 --> 10:17.888
Fate has decided!

10:27.455 --> 10:28.854
No.

10:28.856 --> 10:29.989
No.

10:30.921 --> 10:31.922
No!

10:33.989 --> 10:35.190
No!

10:38.523 --> 10:39.723
Hey!

10:40.955 --> 10:42.989
You need to accept it.

10:52.789 --> 10:54.920
What are you doing?

10:54.922 --> 10:57.054
I ought to ask you
the same question.

10:57.056 --> 10:59.353
I have to consider
my people, boy.

10:59.355 --> 11:03.787
And you only have to consider that one
girl. She's your best friend's daughter.

11:03.789 --> 11:07.955
This is not just about one girl.
You are my son.

11:07.957 --> 11:12.354
And the son of Aldigisl cannot let
himself be led by self-interest.

11:12.356 --> 11:13.854
But also not by fear.

11:13.856 --> 11:15.920
You think I don't have
the courage.

11:15.922 --> 11:19.286
You think I don't have
the courage to lead my people.

11:19.288 --> 11:21.920
The people are afraid.

11:21.922 --> 11:25.754
And if one more harvest fails,
people will die.

11:25.756 --> 11:28.286
So I have to take
that fear into account.

11:28.288 --> 11:32.420
And if you want to be their leader
you will have to do the same.

11:32.422 --> 11:35.854
I believe in our own strength
and our love for each other.

11:35.856 --> 11:37.919
That's the only thing
I'm sure exists.

11:37.921 --> 11:40.053
We have
our customs to consider.

11:40.055 --> 11:42.420
- Sometimes you have to change those customs.
- Oh yes?

11:42.422 --> 11:44.487
You want to throw
everything away?

11:44.489 --> 11:47.486
To throw everything away
which unites a people?

11:47.488 --> 11:50.122
Its traditions,
its practices, its customs?

11:52.855 --> 11:56.886
If you don't respect that, you
don't deserve to be a leader.

11:56.888 --> 12:00.120
I don't want to be a leader of a people
which clings onto barbarian rituals

12:00.122 --> 12:02.319
to ward off its own fears.

12:02.321 --> 12:05.319
I've given you every chance to
become the leader you want to be.

12:05.321 --> 12:07.689
Just like my father
did for me.

12:08.322 --> 12:10.954
But when he died...

12:10.956 --> 12:14.755
I would have given anything
to talk to him once more.

12:15.755 --> 12:18.753
So he could tell me...

12:18.755 --> 12:22.453
and make me understand how
lonely it is to wear that cloak.

12:22.455 --> 12:25.189
This royal fibula.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.521
Listen

12:29.523 --> 12:32.156
to the advice
your father gives you.

12:34.423 --> 12:36.424
Sometimes fathers
become old men.

12:37.922 --> 12:39.923
Past their prime.

13:33.254 --> 13:35.321
I will take the pain away.

14:11.955 --> 14:12.955
Fire!

14:23.020 --> 14:26.220
Aldigisl! We have to get the
children out of the city.

14:26.222 --> 14:28.322
Get all the children
out of the city!

14:35.488 --> 14:38.021
Weapons!
Get the weapons!

14:39.489 --> 14:42.322
Wall!
Wall!

14:53.988 --> 14:55.321
Close the ranks!

14:58.488 --> 15:01.853
Is this Woden's punishment?
It may be.

15:01.855 --> 15:05.952
Is this the day we will all die?
It probably is.

15:05.954 --> 15:09.885
But I do not fear death.
And neither do you.

15:09.887 --> 15:15.085
Because I know one thing for certain.
This is our soil, and our water.

15:15.087 --> 15:18.085
Our city and our land.

15:18.087 --> 15:22.121
I am a free man.
We are free people.

15:26.153 --> 15:31.085
And I will not die on my knees.
Because I have not lived that way.

15:31.087 --> 15:35.018
But we will not be
led by our pride.

15:35.020 --> 15:39.819
We will now retreat,
so we may attack again soon.

15:39.821 --> 15:40.955
Sound the horn!

15:45.054 --> 15:46.119
Retreat.

15:46.121 --> 15:47.854
No.

15:52.321 --> 15:53.854
Stay.

15:56.055 --> 15:58.255
Redbad.
Redbad!

16:17.187 --> 16:18.388
Redbad!

16:46.986 --> 16:50.688
Back! Come on boys,
get out of here. Retreat!

17:15.454 --> 17:17.689
The King is dead.

17:19.287 --> 17:21.954
Dorestad is ours.

19:17.186 --> 19:19.220
They call it
a longhouse, Father.

19:22.052 --> 19:23.721
A long house.

19:25.986 --> 19:27.917
How does it go?

19:27.919 --> 19:30.454
Just some small revolts,
no central leadership.

19:31.320 --> 19:33.351
No leadership.

19:33.353 --> 19:35.917
But you know how it is
with the barbarians.

19:35.919 --> 19:37.919
You can take their land,

19:38.985 --> 19:41.220
but we must break
their will.

19:43.052 --> 19:48.687
Father, this is bishop Willibrord
and his pupil Bonifacius.

19:50.052 --> 19:52.720
- Come!
- They have an authorization from the Pope.

19:55.451 --> 19:57.187
Isn't it beautiful?

19:59.985 --> 20:03.449
That is a hopeful sign,
my Lord.

20:03.451 --> 20:04.450
Yes,

20:04.452 --> 20:07.219
something these barbarians
don't understand,

20:08.186 --> 20:09.217
is obedience,

20:09.219 --> 20:12.751
humility, the pillars
of our faith in Christ.

20:12.753 --> 20:15.818
You'll teach them,
break them like a horse.

20:15.820 --> 20:17.020
- My Lord.
- Hmm.

20:17.320 --> 20:18.320
Yes.

20:19.086 --> 20:20.087
And you.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.784
Yes, my Lord?

20:22.786 --> 20:24.120
You must be careful.

20:28.352 --> 20:30.353
They are wild animals.

20:41.185 --> 20:44.353
Chair, the throne from God.

20:59.452 --> 21:03.083
We've lost Dorestad.

21:03.085 --> 21:07.116
And the Franks now
have complete access

21:07.118 --> 21:11.851
to the Rhine, to our trade,
to our territories.

21:11.853 --> 21:14.183
And whose fault is that?

21:14.185 --> 21:18.249
Aldigisl was responsible.
He was in charge.

21:18.251 --> 21:22.149
Under Aldigisl's leadership, the gods
have given us years of prosperity.

21:22.151 --> 21:25.686
But he was betrayed.
By the Franks.

21:26.485 --> 21:29.417
My brother was a great leader.

21:29.419 --> 21:30.749
But Redbad...

21:30.751 --> 21:33.349
What about him?

21:33.351 --> 21:37.151
If he hadn't been so reckless
Aldigisl wouldn't have been killed.

21:37.153 --> 21:41.120
And he rebelled against his own father.
He ignored his commands.

21:42.018 --> 21:43.753
And why?

21:44.819 --> 21:48.317
For a girl.

21:48.319 --> 21:53.450
That is what you get, when you don't respect
your own traditions, your own culture...

21:53.452 --> 21:55.517
They are talking
about you.

21:55.519 --> 21:58.449
And now Woden has abandoned us.

21:58.451 --> 22:01.118
You have the right
to defend yourself.

22:01.120 --> 22:06.083
Perhaps Woden wants Redbad
to be our new king.

22:06.085 --> 22:08.182
And you want
to go against it?

22:08.184 --> 22:10.353
Let Fate decide.

22:12.119 --> 22:16.185
Every chieftain has the right
to let Fate decide.

22:20.252 --> 22:25.182
Eibert, what on earth are you doing?
He's your own nephew.

22:25.184 --> 22:28.249
Nobody loves Redbad
more than I do.

22:28.251 --> 22:31.050
But if he has brought
this evil upon us,

22:31.052 --> 22:34.118
then it will haunt us
as long as he is among us.

22:42.784 --> 22:47.351
You really have to go inside.
You have to defend yourself now.

22:48.517 --> 22:50.752
Redbad, listen to him.

22:52.984 --> 22:55.116
Do you want to be king?

22:55.118 --> 22:57.015
Me? No.

22:57.017 --> 22:59.082
Because we still choose
our kings here.

22:59.084 --> 23:02.385
And no one here will choose a leader
with a limb and a cursed leg.

23:06.918 --> 23:10.416
Back then I accepted the fact that
my younger brother became king.

23:10.418 --> 23:13.352
And no one has served
him more loyally than I.

23:15.451 --> 23:19.183
And now your son

23:19.185 --> 23:22.019
may take Redbad's place.

23:23.485 --> 23:26.150
That is not on my mind.

23:26.152 --> 23:28.218
I respect our customs.

23:41.484 --> 23:43.985
They are right.

23:47.985 --> 23:50.185
It's my fault.

24:02.018 --> 24:03.786
Come, son.

24:04.884 --> 24:06.718
It is time.

25:09.817 --> 25:11.852
Choose your fate, Redbad.

25:34.884 --> 25:35.918
Guilty.

25:39.284 --> 25:40.851
Woden has spoken.

26:15.384 --> 26:17.419
Is this really necessary?

26:21.817 --> 26:24.184
You know what
this means for us, boy.

26:30.150 --> 26:34.117
Father of the Sea.
Accept this sacrifice from us.

26:34.850 --> 26:36.784
It is time.

26:41.983 --> 26:44.785
No, no, no.
Let me go.

26:53.117 --> 26:55.250
You have to let me go.

26:57.051 --> 27:00.718
I will always love you.
Always, always.

27:14.816 --> 27:17.051
Your ancestors
will watch over you.

27:20.383 --> 27:22.418
Don't forget who you are.

27:30.782 --> 27:33.183
He's going into the sea, now.

27:50.450 --> 27:52.284
Let him go.

27:58.884 --> 28:00.718
Let's go home.

28:35.350 --> 28:36.849
No!

29:21.083 --> 29:24.447
<i>You are my son.
And the son of Aldigisl cannot</i>

29:24.449 --> 29:27.814
<i>let himself be led
by self-interest.</i>

29:27.816 --> 29:30.914
<i>I've given you every chance to
become the leader you want to be.</i>

29:30.916 --> 29:33.248
<i>Just like my father did for me.</i>

29:33.250 --> 29:38.450
<i>And if you don't respect that, you
don't deserve to be their leader.</i>

29:43.483 --> 29:46.047
...for God is great.

29:46.049 --> 29:48.781
And God is good.

29:48.783 --> 29:51.280
Do you not want to welcome
Jesus into your hearts?

29:51.282 --> 29:55.413
He has come to this Earth
to save us.

29:55.415 --> 29:59.347
It is all written here.
It is written.

29:59.349 --> 30:03.980
- A book? A book, dickhead.
- A book!

30:03.982 --> 30:09.249
What is it you want? Do you want
to burn in hell for all eternity?

30:11.881 --> 30:12.982
Why?

30:23.781 --> 30:26.949
On this rock...

30:28.015 --> 30:30.316
I will build my church.

30:32.415 --> 30:36.083
On this rock
I will build my church.

30:48.514 --> 30:51.750
Friezen, listen to what
the bishop has to say.

30:55.315 --> 30:56.315
Or else.

30:59.381 --> 31:00.382
Go.

31:01.015 --> 31:03.314
Forward.

31:03.316 --> 31:06.280
But we cannot spread the word
of Christ with violence.

31:06.282 --> 31:09.949
I'm not here to bring peace.
I'm here to bring the sword.

31:10.949 --> 31:12.684
Music, music!

31:15.115 --> 31:16.717
John said:

31:17.749 --> 31:20.513
For now, I baptize
with moderation.

31:20.515 --> 31:24.080
But he who comes after me,

31:24.082 --> 31:29.247
who is much better than I am,
who is stronger than I am,

31:29.249 --> 31:34.716
he will baptize us
in the Holy Spirit with fire.

31:37.014 --> 31:40.082
The might of the true God
is with us.

31:41.048 --> 31:43.415
Who wants to be baptized?
Him!

31:44.282 --> 31:46.879
Who else wants to be baptized?

31:46.881 --> 31:48.980
Come, come here.

31:48.982 --> 31:51.212
Come, come, come.

31:51.214 --> 31:55.780
I baptize you in the name of the
Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

31:55.782 --> 31:58.846
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

31:58.848 --> 32:00.212
Next. Come!

32:00.214 --> 32:03.381
I baptize you in the name of the
Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

32:06.181 --> 32:07.182
Amen.

32:39.149 --> 32:42.683
He's still alive.
We'll take him with us.

33:13.080 --> 33:15.081
I think he's a Saxon.

33:16.181 --> 33:18.215
Maybe he's a Frisian.

33:20.081 --> 33:23.445
Which tribe are you from?
Who is your father?

33:23.447 --> 33:25.714
Clearly this man
was banished.

33:27.280 --> 33:29.714
His own tribe
wanted him dead.

33:30.180 --> 33:31.381
Huh?

33:32.646 --> 33:36.948
I say kill him, before he brings us bad luck.

33:38.314 --> 33:40.213
Kill him!

33:40.215 --> 33:42.846
Kill him!
Kill him!

33:42.848 --> 33:45.681
We don't just kill
people without a good reason.

33:46.948 --> 33:50.878
Then what do we do?
And can we trust him?

33:50.880 --> 33:55.512
The God of sea left this man,
alive on the beach

33:55.514 --> 33:58.812
and my daughter found him.
That's a sign.

33:58.814 --> 34:01.046
I don't yet know
what it means

34:01.048 --> 34:03.148
but I will take you
into my household.

34:05.215 --> 34:06.748
That's my word.

34:12.380 --> 34:14.112
Just follow me.

34:14.114 --> 34:15.380
Go.

35:21.046 --> 35:23.377
With a new
Frisian leader in place,

35:23.379 --> 35:25.447
maybe this was
a turning point.

35:30.447 --> 35:32.946
God is on our side.

35:36.447 --> 35:38.915
It would be nice
if you believe that too.

35:45.346 --> 35:47.378
Father.

35:47.380 --> 35:53.814
Father, we need to take it to the
next step and continue north.

35:54.848 --> 35:55.881
No.

37:20.846 --> 37:23.180
Where are you going?
Huh?

37:25.047 --> 37:28.214
Why don't you ever say anything?
You're scared of us?

37:29.180 --> 37:31.312
Come on.
No, no, no.

37:31.314 --> 37:34.211
Show us what you can do.

37:34.213 --> 37:37.447
Come on, big guy.
Don't be shy.

37:39.279 --> 37:40.680
Huh?

37:41.513 --> 37:42.714
Come on.

37:58.045 --> 38:00.079
Speed the work up a bit.

38:13.480 --> 38:15.680
You want to go hunting?

38:18.145 --> 38:19.213
Let's go.

38:20.879 --> 38:24.679
This man is coming with us.
Let's go hunting.

38:44.780 --> 38:46.814
I had a dream
last night.

38:47.880 --> 38:49.914
Do you
even have dreams?

38:52.346 --> 38:54.681
A man should think
about his dreams.

38:56.846 --> 38:59.810
<i>I dreamt
I saw a fish.</i>

38:59.812 --> 39:02.878
<i>I saw the same fish in
real life, it was a whale.</i>

39:02.880 --> 39:05.910
<i>Enormous beast. It was dying
under its own weight.</i>

39:05.912 --> 39:07.946
<i>It was terrible to watch.</i>

39:08.812 --> 39:10.813
<i>But the fish in my dream,</i>

39:12.513 --> 39:14.377
<i>it didn't die.</i>

39:14.379 --> 39:17.111
<i>He sucked up all the water
from the sea</i>

39:17.113 --> 39:19.843
<i>and all the fish were just
floundering around on the seafloor</i>

39:19.845 --> 39:22.046
<i>as long as you could see.</i>

39:23.845 --> 39:26.744
I think
that means something.

39:26.746 --> 39:28.746
And I think it has
to do with you.

39:31.812 --> 39:33.846
We found you alive
on the beach.

39:36.745 --> 39:38.779
Have you ever wondered
why you are still alive?

39:42.377 --> 39:44.378
Everything has
a reason,

39:46.878 --> 39:48.046
silent one.

39:52.945 --> 39:54.013
Think about that.

41:02.910 --> 41:04.212
No, the tail.

41:22.512 --> 41:26.175
Oh, Frea. It's coming.

41:26.177 --> 41:28.445
It's time for new live.

41:35.411 --> 41:39.009
Listen up!
I have a son.

41:41.912 --> 41:43.913
I have a son!

41:58.811 --> 42:01.042
Everything in its right place.

42:02.445 --> 42:05.945
Kendryck,
you're a father.

42:07.977 --> 42:10.743
Everyone,
fill up the horns!

42:12.778 --> 42:15.012
Let's celebrate.

42:16.344 --> 42:18.445
Next time it's you.
Oh, here comes.

42:20.810 --> 42:25.212
Oh, my beautiful daughter.
Well done. Well.

43:04.009 --> 43:06.011
Hey, over there.

43:12.744 --> 43:15.243
Ready, everybody.

43:15.245 --> 43:17.279
- Come on! Hurry up!
- Come along, faster!

43:20.077 --> 43:22.175
Make room, make room.

43:22.177 --> 43:23.742
Come on.

43:27.877 --> 43:29.912
Make room, make room.

43:31.444 --> 43:32.445
Come on.

43:33.511 --> 43:35.744
The Sveads
are coming.

43:37.311 --> 43:39.342
It's the Svear.

43:39.344 --> 43:41.445
They would plunder
their own mothers house.

43:42.344 --> 43:44.409
Woden give us strength.

43:47.112 --> 43:48.242
Get ready!

43:48.244 --> 43:49.378
Go! Go!

43:52.910 --> 43:56.209
No, this is not your fight.
You stay here.

43:56.211 --> 43:58.375
It will only bring
bad luck.

43:58.377 --> 44:01.278
It's not your fight.
You will not fight for us.

44:04.344 --> 44:06.211
Try and stop me.

45:38.343 --> 45:39.344
Come on.

46:09.742 --> 46:11.976
Loading. Pull.

46:13.909 --> 46:16.074
To the right. Come on.

46:16.076 --> 46:17.808
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

46:17.810 --> 46:19.375
Hold it, hold it.

46:19.377 --> 46:20.678
Fire.

46:26.276 --> 46:27.277
Fire

46:28.844 --> 46:30.078
- Go.
- Fire.

47:43.875 --> 47:44.876
You're welcome.

48:06.510 --> 48:08.041
Retreat.

48:23.075 --> 48:26.973
<i>The dream I had,
all the fish were dead.</i>

48:26.975 --> 48:29.941
<i>You, silent one,
you're the whale!</i>

48:31.342 --> 48:33.439
- I killed more than him.
- No, you did not.

48:33.441 --> 48:35.173
- I killed more than him.
- No, you did not.

48:35.175 --> 48:36.506
Yes, I did.

48:36.508 --> 48:39.407
I saw you.
My count was higher.

48:39.409 --> 48:41.507
- Why?
- I am a better fighter than you are.

48:41.509 --> 48:43.840
Silent one,

48:43.842 --> 48:46.043
I always thought your arrival
meant something, right?

48:46.975 --> 48:48.109
Something important.

48:51.943 --> 48:53.009
And I was right.

48:55.209 --> 48:58.410
This man is now free.

49:01.108 --> 49:03.173
You can have
a piece of land.

49:03.175 --> 49:05.106
You can even have a family.

49:05.108 --> 49:07.207
Well,
if anyone will have you.

49:09.075 --> 49:11.339
- Who wants that ugly one?
- Yeah!

49:11.341 --> 49:14.439
Oh yeah, we need to find
him a blind woman huh?

49:16.175 --> 49:17.809
A blind woman!

49:26.043 --> 49:28.077
You don't
have to say yes.

49:54.209 --> 49:56.209
You don't even know
my name.

49:59.007 --> 50:00.275
I see you.

50:07.441 --> 50:09.409
This belongs to you.

50:13.174 --> 50:15.176
You've had it
all the time.

50:29.440 --> 50:31.441
Are you ready
for this?

50:34.907 --> 50:36.942
You know I love you.

50:40.941 --> 50:42.307
Will you have her?

50:48.508 --> 50:49.709
Yes.

50:53.775 --> 50:54.942
<i>It's an honor.</i>

50:59.208 --> 51:00.941
<i>My name is Frea</i>

51:03.776 --> 51:05.276
daughter of Wiglek.

51:12.374 --> 51:13.975
My name is Redbad,

51:15.175 --> 51:16.842
son of Aldigisl.

51:20.907 --> 51:23.240
Let's celebrate!

51:30.373 --> 51:31.908
Make her happy.

51:32.507 --> 51:33.709
I will.

52:35.975 --> 52:36.976
Pepijn?

52:39.008 --> 52:41.076
- Pepijn?
- The church.

52:42.108 --> 52:43.405
My church.

52:43.407 --> 52:44.906
What's going on?

52:44.908 --> 52:46.275
Godless heathen.

52:47.407 --> 52:49.141
Godless heathen!

52:51.874 --> 52:52.942
My church.

52:54.508 --> 52:56.208
He will punish!

52:57.842 --> 53:00.042
He will punish!

53:31.207 --> 53:34.471
Build another church, have it
ready by the time I return.

53:34.473 --> 53:36.838
We'll have them
do that.

53:36.840 --> 53:38.940
And this time
made of stone.

53:41.172 --> 53:42.273
Yes, Father.

53:43.041 --> 53:44.107
Sit down, Drogo.

53:51.206 --> 53:53.373
Do exactly
as we've agreed.

54:06.107 --> 54:07.307
My Lord.

54:09.274 --> 54:11.838
Perhaps you can tell me
what terrible crimes

54:11.840 --> 54:14.408
that I have committed that
you would do this to me?

54:15.906 --> 54:17.941
A house of God.

54:21.441 --> 54:22.808
Our people,

54:25.307 --> 54:27.740
are being exploited
and abused.

54:30.273 --> 54:32.707
Is it so strange
that they're revolting?

54:33.439 --> 54:36.505
I gave you the freedom

54:36.507 --> 54:38.771
to govern your own areas

54:38.773 --> 54:42.305
and collect part
of my taxes.

54:42.307 --> 54:46.105
Our people don't even
understand what taxes are.

54:46.107 --> 54:48.404
Let alone that they
can pay such amounts.

54:48.406 --> 54:49.807
It's ridiculous.

54:51.973 --> 54:54.007
Your son
should guard his tongue.

54:57.972 --> 55:00.071
We keep our promises.

55:00.073 --> 55:01.741
Keep your promises.

55:02.740 --> 55:04.871
I can't counsel
a compromise

55:04.873 --> 55:07.837
with people who resist
the true faith,

55:07.839 --> 55:13.270
who allow my churches
to be set on fire.

55:13.272 --> 55:15.274
It's time you made
a good example.

55:16.939 --> 55:18.338
How?

55:18.340 --> 55:19.373
You will see.

55:20.307 --> 55:21.374
You will see.

55:51.339 --> 55:56.173
I come on behalf of
King Pepijn of Herstal.

55:57.172 --> 55:59.471
And I have a proposal

55:59.473 --> 56:03.939
to return peace
to our peoples.

56:05.806 --> 56:09.674
The daughter of Aldigisl
lives here.

56:12.440 --> 56:14.674
But, is she still a virgin?

56:31.107 --> 56:34.204
- We cannot give her away, can we?
- Why not?

56:34.206 --> 56:37.003
This is a symbol of friendship
from the Franks. We really need them.

56:37.005 --> 56:39.272
And have Sinde
baptized against her will?

56:41.205 --> 56:43.971
She makes
this sacrifice for the gods.

56:43.973 --> 56:46.269
We don't have a choice.

56:46.271 --> 56:49.304
Or do you want to start a war against
the most powerful army in the world?

56:49.306 --> 56:53.973
- Redbad should have made this decision, not us.
- Redbad is dead.

56:58.139 --> 57:01.769
Come on, boy.
Accept this proposal.

57:01.771 --> 57:04.341
This is the moment to show
that you're a decisive leader.

57:36.505 --> 57:40.073
Sea. Sea. Good?

57:43.473 --> 57:45.006
Stone. Stone?

57:47.038 --> 57:48.303
Ow!

57:49.472 --> 57:50.972
- Fot.
- What?

57:52.172 --> 57:53.206
Voot?

57:54.873 --> 57:55.905
Foot.

57:57.406 --> 57:58.440
Foot.

58:00.171 --> 58:01.172
You.

58:02.072 --> 58:04.140
No. You?

58:06.071 --> 58:07.072
I.

58:10.038 --> 58:11.403
We.

58:21.939 --> 58:25.137
I have news
from Frisian territory.

58:25.139 --> 58:28.203
The Frisian made a truce
with the Franks

58:28.205 --> 58:32.239
by marrying off the daughter
of king Aldigisl.

58:44.772 --> 58:47.003
<i>It's not about you.</i>

58:47.005 --> 58:49.006
<i>And it's not about me.</i>

58:51.840 --> 58:54.737
Where have you been
all this time?

58:54.739 --> 58:56.739
What have they done to you?

58:59.939 --> 59:03.137
Get me out of here.
I want to go home.

59:03.139 --> 59:05.140
<i>Redbad!</i>

59:18.271 --> 59:20.305
I cannot allow this
to happen.

59:23.139 --> 59:25.140
It's
Frankish territory now.

59:26.771 --> 59:29.172
It's teaming with
soldiers down there.

59:34.238 --> 59:37.303
They won't
recognize me.

59:37.305 --> 59:39.705
You're not exactly
hard to recognize.

59:41.238 --> 59:42.905
She's my sister.

59:45.471 --> 59:47.335
Mmm.

59:47.337 --> 59:49.438
I cannot allow them
to simply hand her over.

59:53.137 --> 59:55.171
You really want to rescue
her from the Franks?

59:57.405 --> 01:00:00.402
I don't know,
I don't have a plan.

01:00:00.404 --> 01:00:02.438
But I must try
something.

01:00:09.938 --> 01:00:12.005
Then we go together.

01:00:13.406 --> 01:00:14.470
Hmm.

01:00:19.504 --> 01:00:20.806
Hey baby.

01:00:49.438 --> 01:00:51.737
It's time to say goodbye.

01:00:51.739 --> 01:00:52.739
Yeah.

01:00:55.305 --> 01:00:56.339
I love you.

01:00:57.370 --> 01:00:58.436
I love you.

01:01:03.771 --> 01:01:06.372
Oh God,
I'm gonna miss you.

01:01:28.104 --> 01:01:30.468
<i>Take good care of her.
Give her a home</i>

01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:32.671
<i>like we have a home right here.</i>

01:01:36.837 --> 01:01:38.270
We will come back.

01:01:41.304 --> 01:01:43.371
Please follow your heart.

01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:49.171
Go!

01:02:34.203 --> 01:02:35.438
Welcome.

01:02:59.070 --> 01:03:00.204
My grace.

01:03:15.105 --> 01:03:16.905
It's a great pleasure.

01:03:32.170 --> 01:03:34.337
Oh, your room
is upstairs.

01:04:25.403 --> 01:04:28.771
Left, right, left, right.
Left, right.

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:34.501
Come on, Come on.
Don't resist, don't resist.

01:04:34.503 --> 01:04:36.767
We better get you.
Come on.

01:04:40.435 --> 01:04:44.671
...de Vader,
de Zoon en de Heilige Geest.

01:05:29.204 --> 01:05:31.737
Is this the bride?
Let me see.

01:05:33.302 --> 01:05:35.900
We are accepting you

01:05:35.902 --> 01:05:37.936
into our family
like a daughter.

01:05:38.937 --> 01:05:40.037
My daughter.

01:05:41.035 --> 01:05:44.900
You will sit
at our dining table

01:05:44.902 --> 01:05:48.133
you will warm yourself
by our hearth

01:05:48.135 --> 01:05:52.736
and you will sleep
in our bed.

01:05:55.168 --> 01:05:57.170
You have no choice.

01:06:06.235 --> 01:06:07.869
You should realize,

01:06:09.769 --> 01:06:11.903
I don't extend a hand twice.

01:06:14.102 --> 01:06:16.234
I'm not afraid to die.

01:06:16.236 --> 01:06:17.238
Hmm.

01:06:20.802 --> 01:06:23.270
You do this in the name
of that God of yours?

01:06:24.335 --> 01:06:25.770
Yes or no?

01:06:38.236 --> 01:06:39.370
Yes.

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:48.404
No, no.

01:06:59.936 --> 01:07:01.702
That was unnecessary.

01:07:32.802 --> 01:07:34.970
You can't tell anyone.

01:07:36.102 --> 01:07:38.102
It's between you

01:07:39.469 --> 01:07:40.736
and I.

01:08:19.868 --> 01:08:20.902
Wait here.

01:08:23.203 --> 01:08:24.236
I'll be back soon.

01:08:47.367 --> 01:08:49.734
God, give me the power.

01:09:08.901 --> 01:09:11.069
On your knees.
Come on.

01:09:17.268 --> 01:09:19.068
Kiss it.
Kiss it!

01:09:46.035 --> 01:09:47.670
Relax, relax...

01:10:21.401 --> 01:10:25.802
Do you forsake
the devil and all his works?

01:10:26.901 --> 01:10:28.735
Yes or no?

01:10:30.468 --> 01:10:31.669
Yes?

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:35.834
Or no?

01:10:53.133 --> 01:10:54.834
Huh?

01:11:07.134 --> 01:11:08.168
Sinde.

01:11:18.101 --> 01:11:20.001
Who are you?

01:11:20.868 --> 01:11:22.932
Capture him. You.

01:11:28.901 --> 01:11:31.135
Say the Almighty Father.

01:11:32.468 --> 01:11:35.865
I believe in God,

01:11:40.233 --> 01:11:42.768
and his son, Jesus Christ.

01:11:51.167 --> 01:11:54.431
Do you forsake
the heathen gods?

01:11:54.433 --> 01:11:58.733
Woden, Donar, Freya...

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:01.701
Yes?

01:12:08.267 --> 01:12:09.934
The Almighty Father.

01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:14.032
Yes.

01:12:14.034 --> 01:12:17.332
And Jesus Christ, his son.

01:12:40.301 --> 01:12:42.865
You have been baptized.
Well done, girl.

01:12:45.801 --> 01:12:47.769
Come, come, come.

01:13:24.499 --> 01:13:27.134
- Do you trust me?
- Why?

01:13:44.433 --> 01:13:47.267
This is a good step, girl.
You will see.

01:13:52.033 --> 01:13:53.498
You will see.

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:55.100
Now.

01:14:11.367 --> 01:14:13.430
I must know
who's responsible for this.

01:14:13.432 --> 01:14:15.331
What do you mean?

01:14:15.333 --> 01:14:16.335
Redbad?

01:14:20.332 --> 01:14:24.433
I've told you.
No one between you and me.

01:14:33.133 --> 01:14:35.200
Who is this new ruler?

01:14:37.199 --> 01:14:39.297
There are some rumors, Father.

01:14:39.299 --> 01:14:41.768
Rumors?
What rumors?

01:14:42.834 --> 01:14:43.999
Aldigisl's son.

01:14:45.734 --> 01:14:46.768
Redbad.

01:14:48.365 --> 01:14:51.099
But Redbad...
Redbad is dead.

01:14:53.165 --> 01:14:56.131
Fairy tales.
Nothing important.

01:14:56.133 --> 01:14:58.864
Maybe we should have
never taken Dorestad.

01:14:58.866 --> 01:15:01.964
Shouldn't have taken
Dorestad?

01:15:01.966 --> 01:15:05.000
Sometimes you think an
idea is inspired by God

01:15:06.499 --> 01:15:10.166
but it's your pride,
your ambition speaking.

01:15:12.799 --> 01:15:14.233
We will wait here,

01:15:15.299 --> 01:15:16.766
until after winter

01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:20.767
and I will make a decision.

01:15:23.999 --> 01:15:25.034
No, Father.

01:15:26.999 --> 01:15:30.429
We have to act now,
and we have to act fast.

01:15:30.431 --> 01:15:33.797
And then the whole area up to
the sea is for the taking.

01:15:33.799 --> 01:15:36.330
We need to call
for extra troops. Now.

01:15:36.332 --> 01:15:37.968
- No. No!
- Father.

01:15:40.166 --> 01:15:43.063
You spend time
with your new wife.

01:15:43.065 --> 01:15:45.200
A happy woman
bares more children.

01:16:28.465 --> 01:16:30.832
Redbad?
Redbad, is that you?

01:16:32.765 --> 01:16:33.767
Gebbe.

01:16:35.833 --> 01:16:38.266
I...
Where have you been?

01:16:44.898 --> 01:16:46.932
This is my wife, Frea.

01:16:47.932 --> 01:16:49.932
And this is my son,
Poppo.

01:16:53.164 --> 01:16:54.963
Welcome, beauty.

01:16:54.965 --> 01:16:57.763
It's really you.
You're back.

01:16:57.765 --> 01:17:00.099
Hey boys, bugger off.
Get away.

01:17:02.431 --> 01:17:04.732
They think
you've returned from Valhalla.

01:17:42.132 --> 01:17:43.199
Fenne.

01:17:45.964 --> 01:17:46.998
Hey.

01:18:00.965 --> 01:18:03.099
This is Frea,
daughter of Wiglek.

01:18:05.466 --> 01:18:07.699
And my son,
Poppo.

01:18:14.898 --> 01:18:16.265
You have a son.

01:18:17.498 --> 01:18:18.699
Yes.

01:18:25.865 --> 01:18:27.866
Welcome to our people,
Frea.

01:18:29.865 --> 01:18:32.132
This is my husband,
Wulf, son of Ragnak.

01:18:33.798 --> 01:18:35.798
We have prayed
for you.

01:18:37.997 --> 01:18:38.999
Redbad.

01:18:50.164 --> 01:18:51.863
Look at you.

01:19:09.964 --> 01:19:14.129
<i>I would like to know
why Redbad is here.</i>

01:19:14.131 --> 01:19:16.233
If I recall correctly,
he was exiled.

01:19:18.498 --> 01:19:19.699
Exiled?

01:19:21.164 --> 01:19:23.096
I thought I was sacrificed.

01:19:23.098 --> 01:19:25.361
Then why has he
not died?

01:19:28.931 --> 01:19:31.863
Perhaps Uncle Eibert fears that I
want to take back my father's land.

01:19:31.865 --> 01:19:33.865
Upon which he now lives.

01:19:58.963 --> 01:19:59.965
Redbad.

01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:03.864
Stand up.

01:20:26.765 --> 01:20:28.232
This belongs to you.

01:20:39.097 --> 01:20:41.862
I welcome Redbad.

01:20:47.231 --> 01:20:50.265
And now?
Now you intend to stay.

01:20:52.330 --> 01:20:53.665
I don't know.

01:20:55.964 --> 01:20:59.029
You cannot leave.
You have only just arrived.

01:20:59.031 --> 01:21:02.095
You have married off my sister.
And you let them baptize her.

01:21:02.097 --> 01:21:04.463
- We had good reasons.
- Oh yes?

01:21:04.465 --> 01:21:06.095
Yes.

01:21:06.097 --> 01:21:08.994
A free person cannot be
baptized against her will.

01:21:08.996 --> 01:21:11.097
Especially not
the daughter of Aldigisl.

01:21:12.297 --> 01:21:13.364
Your brother.

01:21:15.298 --> 01:21:17.698
Everywhere I come,
I see scared people.

01:21:19.262 --> 01:21:21.829
Dorestad was once
a free city.

01:21:21.831 --> 01:21:24.728
Where everyone could go
and do as they pleased.

01:21:24.730 --> 01:21:27.730
Where everyone could act freely,
regardless of where they came from.

01:21:28.230 --> 01:21:30.928
And now?

01:21:30.930 --> 01:21:34.261
You have already brought ill fortune upon
us once. Why would we listen to you now?

01:21:34.263 --> 01:21:35.331
Father!

01:21:36.864 --> 01:21:38.898
You let yourself be led by fear.

01:21:40.930 --> 01:21:42.965
What has happened
to you all?

01:22:14.230 --> 01:22:16.730
This all feels
very familiar, but,

01:22:19.362 --> 01:22:22.230
at the same time it's as if I don't
recognize these people anymore.

01:22:26.763 --> 01:22:29.865
- You know, Fenne and I...
- You don't have to say anything.

01:22:33.429 --> 01:22:34.897
I trust you.

01:22:49.162 --> 01:22:51.330
Why do you let your own kin
treat you like this?

01:22:55.130 --> 01:22:57.264
You are your father's
rightful heir.

01:23:01.962 --> 01:23:04.397
You look hurt every time
you hear his name.

01:23:07.229 --> 01:23:08.230
Why?

01:23:47.962 --> 01:23:49.963
When I'm no longer here,

01:23:52.464 --> 01:23:55.131
I want you to help him.

01:23:57.729 --> 01:23:59.097
Can I trust you?

01:24:01.763 --> 01:24:03.297
Of course, Father.

01:24:04.163 --> 01:24:06.163
I know your pride.

01:24:06.995 --> 01:24:08.963
I know your anger.

01:24:09.329 --> 01:24:11.028
But he...

01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:13.131
He is the successor
to the throne.

01:24:14.162 --> 01:24:15.961
And you,

01:24:15.963 --> 01:24:18.930
you, you are the son
of a kitchen maid.

01:24:23.496 --> 01:24:25.327
Go ahead, drink.

01:24:25.329 --> 01:24:28.397
And get the rest you so long for.
That's right.

01:24:29.862 --> 01:24:31.393
That's right, Father.

01:24:31.395 --> 01:24:32.763
Oh, good.

01:24:36.095 --> 01:24:39.126
Father wants the fourth army
moved to Dorestad.

01:24:39.128 --> 01:24:41.226
You, what have you done?

01:24:41.228 --> 01:24:43.294
I would hurry
if I were you.

01:24:43.296 --> 01:24:44.796
Go.

01:24:45.729 --> 01:24:47.864
Help me.
I need a doctor!

01:24:49.497 --> 01:24:52.930
Help me.
What have you done?

01:24:57.962 --> 01:25:00.864
I may not believe
in heaven,

01:25:02.062 --> 01:25:04.363
but I know there's a hell,

01:25:05.829 --> 01:25:09.927
and you will rot in it.

01:25:09.929 --> 01:25:11.396
I'll kill you!

01:25:11.930 --> 01:25:15.264
No! No!

01:25:40.062 --> 01:25:41.230
Do you still remember?

01:25:44.095 --> 01:25:47.397
This is the North Star.
This is us.

01:25:50.128 --> 01:25:51.362
This is the Moon.

01:25:58.295 --> 01:26:00.696
Planets move in fixed patterns.

01:26:02.262 --> 01:26:04.296
That's what you've taught me.

01:26:06.462 --> 01:26:08.992
You can calculate
when the days become longer

01:26:08.994 --> 01:26:11.062
and when the Moon
makes the tide strongest.

01:26:17.029 --> 01:26:19.064
Your father's time had come.

01:26:20.929 --> 01:26:22.930
His death was not your fault.

01:26:25.396 --> 01:26:27.430
Great changes are coming.

01:26:29.129 --> 01:26:31.296
Your father didn't fit
into the New World.

01:26:32.830 --> 01:26:36.727
And you...
You will have to adapt

01:26:36.729 --> 01:26:40.195
- to pave the way for future generations.
- No.

01:26:43.295 --> 01:26:46.327
Jurre is king now.

01:26:46.329 --> 01:26:50.662
So you are no longer necessary?
Everything is as it should be?

01:26:55.329 --> 01:26:57.430
Why did you come back?

01:28:00.229 --> 01:28:03.426
May Jesus Christ,

01:28:03.428 --> 01:28:06.162
through this holy anointment

01:28:06.861 --> 01:28:07.928
have...

01:28:09.096 --> 01:28:10.196
Ah...

01:28:11.129 --> 01:28:12.928
Ah, yes.

01:28:15.327 --> 01:28:17.729
Yes. Yes.

01:28:19.195 --> 01:28:20.228
Him.

01:28:22.461 --> 01:28:24.292
Him? Him?

01:28:24.294 --> 01:28:25.361
Him!

01:28:27.729 --> 01:28:29.896
- Him!
- Him. Him.

01:28:32.161 --> 01:28:35.062
May Jesus...

01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:54.062
Drogo?

01:28:56.227 --> 01:28:57.395
Let him go.

01:29:01.728 --> 01:29:03.995
I am the mother
of the crown prince,

01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:07.294
and therefore,

01:29:10.095 --> 01:29:12.194
the regent of the empire.

01:29:22.159 --> 01:29:23.293
Sit down, Drogo.

01:29:52.161 --> 01:29:53.262
Come on, boy.

01:29:54.494 --> 01:29:55.694
Come here.

01:29:56.327 --> 01:29:58.361
Where are you taking him?

01:29:59.427 --> 01:30:00.429
Drogo?

01:30:01.161 --> 01:30:02.162
Drogo?

01:30:02.994 --> 01:30:04.162
Drogo?

01:30:12.761 --> 01:30:14.062
Come hear it.

01:30:15.427 --> 01:30:19.358
A cart drove along
an old road...

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:23.058
- No, it's a sandy road.
- Oh, I am sorry.

01:30:23.060 --> 01:30:26.825
<i>♪ A cart drove along
a sandy road... ♪</i>

01:30:26.827 --> 01:30:30.827
Wait, wait, wait,
this way I can hear you better.

01:30:31.359 --> 01:30:32.425
Like this.

01:30:37.927 --> 01:30:39.028
This is high.

01:30:40.728 --> 01:30:42.890
But you're not afraid, right?

01:30:42.892 --> 01:30:44.025
Yeah.

01:30:44.027 --> 01:30:45.990
Okay, I'll hold your hand.

01:30:45.992 --> 01:30:50.425
<i>♪ A cart drove along
a sandy road</i>

01:30:50.427 --> 01:30:54.424
<i>♪ The moon shone bright
the road was wide</i>

01:30:54.426 --> 01:30:57.959
<i>♪ A horse walked happily
I'll bet it'll... ♪</i>

01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:04.262
...asleep

01:32:43.226 --> 01:32:45.294
Swords up.
Shields down.

01:34:23.158 --> 01:34:24.694
They are coming.

01:34:26.092 --> 01:34:29.323
- How near are they?
- We don't know. We need Redbad.

01:34:29.325 --> 01:34:31.992
She is right. We cannot
do this without Redbad.

01:34:35.326 --> 01:34:36.893
Go get Redbad, now.

01:34:53.858 --> 01:34:55.724
Why have you come?

01:34:55.726 --> 01:34:57.726
I was summoned by the King.

01:35:02.225 --> 01:35:05.159
- That means you have to listen to what I say.
- You know me, don't you?

01:35:08.093 --> 01:35:09.322
Let's go!

01:35:13.792 --> 01:35:15.856
Wulf, Redbad, south side.

01:35:15.858 --> 01:35:18.223
The rest of you come with me,
from the north.

01:35:55.791 --> 01:35:56.793
Let's go back.

01:36:11.726 --> 01:36:13.259
Formation!

01:36:14.892 --> 01:36:16.024
Turn!

01:36:27.291 --> 01:36:28.659
Hold!

01:36:30.425 --> 01:36:31.725
Turn!

01:36:33.357 --> 01:36:34.359
Shield!

01:36:35.458 --> 01:36:36.660
Wall!

01:36:54.325 --> 01:36:56.859
This is madness.
We must retreat.

01:37:30.924 --> 01:37:33.922
Where is General Focard?

01:37:33.924 --> 01:37:36.291
I don't know, my Lord,
he was just here.

01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:58.791
Looking for this?

01:38:03.292 --> 01:38:04.859
Damn him.

01:38:13.758 --> 01:38:15.659
Come, come, come.

01:38:16.025 --> 01:38:17.190
Come on.

01:38:18.758 --> 01:38:20.155
Get that man.

01:38:20.157 --> 01:38:22.291
The cavalry sir,
we should stay together.

01:38:24.123 --> 01:38:26.057
Wait for my signal!

01:38:29.091 --> 01:38:31.125
Send the cavalry now.

01:38:31.857 --> 01:38:34.121
Cavalry in pursuit!

01:38:34.123 --> 01:38:36.822
Go! Hurry up!

01:38:36.824 --> 01:38:37.824
Move!

01:38:45.492 --> 01:38:46.922
Engage!

01:38:46.924 --> 01:38:48.191
Muur! Vuur!

01:38:58.391 --> 01:38:59.889
Archers!

01:39:08.125 --> 01:39:09.192
Wall!

01:39:26.458 --> 01:39:29.088
Fire!

01:39:34.890 --> 01:39:37.188
For Woden!

01:41:41.889 --> 01:41:43.124
It's high tide.

01:41:46.024 --> 01:41:47.091
Easy. Easy.

01:42:23.490 --> 01:42:27.187
Jurre! Jurre!
This isn't working.

01:42:27.189 --> 01:42:29.922
We're being pushed back.
There are too many of them.

01:42:35.156 --> 01:42:37.223
Odulf, protect Jurre!

01:42:43.422 --> 01:42:45.757
- We must retreat.
- I won't surrender.

01:42:46.788 --> 01:42:49.356
- Let me go.
- We don't stand a chance.

01:42:53.888 --> 01:42:56.323
Listen, boy.
We must regroup.

01:43:33.888 --> 01:43:35.956
Where are my men?

01:43:40.489 --> 01:43:43.223
What are you doing?
We must push on.

01:43:57.190 --> 01:43:59.990
Wall! Wall! Wall!

01:44:23.954 --> 01:44:25.320
Now!

01:44:41.922 --> 01:44:44.989
Charge! Now!

01:46:09.454 --> 01:46:11.688
We should retreat, my Lord.

01:46:20.788 --> 01:46:22.789
We have the upper hand!

01:47:15.754 --> 01:47:17.154
Redbad!

01:47:18.822 --> 01:47:22.452
Redbad! Redbad!
Redbad! Redbad!

01:47:22.454 --> 01:47:25.752
Redbad! Redbad!
Redbad! Redbad!

01:47:25.754 --> 01:47:29.086
Redbad! Redbad!
Redbad! Redbad!

01:47:29.088 --> 01:47:31.951
Redbad! Redbad!
Redbad! Redbad!

01:47:41.388 --> 01:47:43.988
A time will come when you have
to show who's the leader.

01:48:19.354 --> 01:48:21.389
We seem to have
a common problem.

01:48:22.854 --> 01:48:25.151
This Redbad.

01:48:25.153 --> 01:48:27.286
We have him
under control.

01:48:27.288 --> 01:48:29.389
Redbad is rallying
troops everywhere.

01:48:32.787 --> 01:48:35.086
They won't do anything
without my son's orders.

01:48:35.088 --> 01:48:38.055
But does your son
take orders himself?

01:48:39.321 --> 01:48:40.322
Of course.

01:48:42.387 --> 01:48:44.254
Really?

01:48:46.921 --> 01:48:49.151
I want Redbad eliminated,

01:48:49.153 --> 01:48:51.221
and then
I can return home.

01:48:53.486 --> 01:48:55.755
But... But who would
govern Dorestad?

01:49:00.121 --> 01:49:02.788
I'll gladly leave that
to a loyal, deputy.

01:50:05.253 --> 01:50:07.254
- I...
- You don't have to say anything.

01:51:00.921 --> 01:51:03.217
Now they're clinging
on to their gods even more.

01:51:03.219 --> 01:51:05.884
Now more than ever.

01:51:05.886 --> 01:51:08.984
Oh, you understand them?
They just keep on believing.

01:51:08.986 --> 01:51:10.884
What good
does it do?

01:51:10.886 --> 01:51:13.121
Something to
hold on to, Redbad.

01:51:14.287 --> 01:51:16.818
Something to
hold on to.

01:51:16.820 --> 01:51:18.854
That Jesus of yours
is not much better.

01:51:20.086 --> 01:51:24.084
- Oh?
- All those massacres in his name.

01:51:24.086 --> 01:51:26.087
It's not Jesus
who does that.

01:51:30.853 --> 01:51:33.887
What do you think these people will do
when they find out that I'm a Christian?

01:51:42.286 --> 01:51:44.287
Perhaps we should
return to your family.

01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:49.020
And abandon your people?

01:51:50.252 --> 01:51:52.353
<i>What does
your heart say?</i>

01:51:53.385 --> 01:51:55.384
Fear.

01:51:55.386 --> 01:51:58.353
- For what?
- For what others see in me.

01:52:00.319 --> 01:52:02.383
You've just
said it yourself.

01:52:02.385 --> 01:52:04.419
These people
deserve better.

01:52:05.319 --> 01:52:06.750
A better leader.

01:52:06.752 --> 01:52:08.818
How can I
lead these people

01:52:08.820 --> 01:52:10.783
when I don't even know
what I believe in?

01:52:10.785 --> 01:52:13.484
You believe
the gods do nothing.

01:52:13.486 --> 01:52:15.720
But they have
sent you, Redbad.

01:52:16.853 --> 01:52:18.920
I don't believe
in that nonsense.

01:52:20.086 --> 01:52:21.953
True leaders
take power.

01:52:24.152 --> 01:52:25.949
By force.

01:52:25.951 --> 01:52:28.049
<i>Frea says
you should always...</i>

01:52:28.051 --> 01:52:30.918
Frea knows what
she believes in.

01:52:30.920 --> 01:52:33.918
Yes. In the God
of the Christians.

01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:35.987
No, in you.

01:52:36.953 --> 01:52:39.017
<i>Frea believes in you.</i>

01:52:39.019 --> 01:52:41.085
<i>Why are you not
doing that to yourself?</i>

01:52:41.087 --> 01:52:44.385
<i>Or do you believe that
Jurre will save this people?</i>

01:52:44.387 --> 01:52:48.317
Come on, Redbad. It is not
about rituals or customs.

01:52:48.319 --> 01:52:53.021
Or about cloaks or fibulas.
It is about what's in here.

01:52:54.053 --> 01:52:56.383
<i>Your love
for Frea and Poppo.</i>

01:52:56.385 --> 01:52:59.750
<i>For your father.
For your country.</i>

01:52:59.752 --> 01:53:01.918
<i>That is what
gives you strength.</i>

01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:04.021
And that is what
people see in you.

01:53:05.853 --> 01:53:08.850
You keep coming here
with questions.

01:53:08.852 --> 01:53:10.853
But you already know
the answers.

01:53:13.051 --> 01:53:15.052
You just have to
want to hear them.

01:54:53.718 --> 01:54:56.419
- I don't have much time.
- I'm not here for that.

01:54:58.952 --> 01:55:01.818
You want me to baptize
your son, don't you?

01:55:03.251 --> 01:55:05.285
My husband
is not a Christian.

01:55:11.118 --> 01:55:12.686
My husband is Redbad.

01:55:14.050 --> 01:55:15.151
Redbad?

01:55:22.085 --> 01:55:25.848
Then it is especially important that
I baptize him as soon as possible.

01:55:25.850 --> 01:55:30.049
You cannot force people
to become Christians.

01:55:30.051 --> 01:55:33.416
Jesus says you should
love your enemies.

01:55:33.418 --> 01:55:36.383
Without reluctance
or compulsion.

01:55:36.385 --> 01:55:38.985
For God loves
a cheerful giver.

01:55:42.919 --> 01:55:46.383
If the people would only
engage in conversation with us

01:55:46.385 --> 01:55:49.482
they would start to see that we
Christians even treat our enemies...

01:55:49.484 --> 01:55:52.482
The way you're doing it now
will only provoke more war.

01:55:52.484 --> 01:55:54.917
Is that
what you want?

01:55:54.919 --> 01:55:55.986
Not me.

01:55:57.851 --> 01:56:00.050
But to convince
Willibrord that...

01:56:00.052 --> 01:56:01.152
Talk to him.

01:56:02.818 --> 01:56:05.351
Talk to him, and let
him convince Charles.

01:56:08.351 --> 01:56:10.351
Otherwise,
it will be a massacre.

01:56:12.350 --> 01:56:14.351
Do you want that
on your conscience?

01:56:17.151 --> 01:56:18.152
All right.

01:56:23.917 --> 01:56:25.318
I will try my best.

01:57:18.385 --> 01:57:19.819
We must continue.

01:57:20.819 --> 01:57:22.819
We must push on now.

01:57:23.884 --> 01:57:24.815
Should we attack?

01:57:24.817 --> 01:57:27.215
At least that way
we'll gain the initiative.

01:57:27.217 --> 01:57:29.851
We don't have a choice.
We must free Dorestad.

01:57:33.285 --> 01:57:38.119
You want to attack the most powerful
army in the world, and defeat it.

01:57:40.217 --> 01:57:41.251
Yes.

01:57:43.051 --> 01:57:44.652
We'll do it together.

01:58:12.284 --> 01:58:14.081
I've spoken to a priest.

01:58:14.083 --> 01:58:16.214
I've asked you
not to intervene.

01:58:16.216 --> 01:58:19.048
I can get
through to him.

01:58:19.050 --> 01:58:21.748
Priests have blood on their hands.
They cannot be trusted.

01:58:21.750 --> 01:58:23.981
Is that really
what you want?

01:58:23.983 --> 01:58:25.984
To solve everything
with the sword?

01:58:27.016 --> 01:58:28.948
The sword
does not lie.

01:58:28.950 --> 01:58:31.114
That's the only thing
I believe in.

01:58:31.116 --> 01:58:34.351
Then you're exactly what they name you.
A barbarian.

01:58:37.283 --> 01:58:39.317
But that's not
who you are.

01:58:52.784 --> 01:58:53.884
Redbad.

01:58:55.051 --> 01:58:56.350
How is Frea?

01:58:57.284 --> 01:58:58.748
Is she manageable?

01:58:58.750 --> 01:59:00.148
You know her.

01:59:00.150 --> 01:59:02.018
Is she afraid of dying?

01:59:02.784 --> 01:59:04.118
What is your plan?

01:59:08.216 --> 01:59:11.051
How many ships can you bring to
Dorestad before the next full moon?

01:59:13.783 --> 01:59:14.852
Enough.

01:59:16.117 --> 01:59:18.151
Why by
the next full moon?

01:59:25.917 --> 01:59:28.015
Leave some Franks
for us.

01:59:28.017 --> 01:59:29.018
Yeah.

01:59:42.949 --> 01:59:45.050
- It will be all right.
- I know.

01:59:50.383 --> 01:59:54.251
I wish I could find the words
to keep you here, Father.

01:59:56.783 --> 01:59:59.917
I wish I could find the words to
convince you to come with me.

02:00:03.249 --> 02:00:04.350
Father...

02:00:06.215 --> 02:00:09.781
There have to be other
ways to convert them.

02:00:09.783 --> 02:00:12.652
Those barbarians
only speak one language.

02:00:14.918 --> 02:00:19.115
And yet, they are people.
Just like you and me.

02:00:19.117 --> 02:00:21.184
If you would only
talk to them.

02:00:30.717 --> 02:00:32.717
You are a good boy.

02:00:34.950 --> 02:00:38.815
But if you can only see
the good in people

02:00:38.817 --> 02:00:41.717
then you will often be
so disappointed in the end.

02:00:43.250 --> 02:00:44.984
My son.

02:01:10.048 --> 02:01:11.149
Stop it!

02:01:14.981 --> 02:01:17.080
No, not our sacred oak!

02:01:21.382 --> 02:01:23.880
Stop!

02:01:23.882 --> 02:01:27.651
Stop!

02:01:33.449 --> 02:01:34.847
Music!

02:01:38.948 --> 02:01:43.013
If this thing,
this tree,

02:01:43.015 --> 02:01:45.382
if it is so sacred,

02:01:45.384 --> 02:01:49.481
then why does Donar
not hurl a thunderbolt

02:01:49.483 --> 02:01:52.151
from the sky to kill me?

02:01:52.917 --> 02:01:56.781
Why, huh?
Why? Why?

02:01:56.783 --> 02:01:58.783
Come on. Donar!

02:01:59.149 --> 02:02:00.781
Come on!

02:02:00.783 --> 02:02:03.150
Come on, here I am!

02:02:10.382 --> 02:02:13.150
See?
Nothing at all.

02:02:13.917 --> 02:02:15.183
Nothing...

02:02:17.482 --> 02:02:21.316
Superstition.
Nothing but superstition.

02:02:22.383 --> 02:02:25.779
You don't have to
sacrifice people.

02:02:25.781 --> 02:02:30.181
Jesus...
Jesus has sacrificed himself.

02:02:30.183 --> 02:02:32.017
For all of us!

02:02:46.816 --> 02:02:49.180
A platoon of Franks is
cutting down the sacred oak.

02:02:49.182 --> 02:02:51.246
They have Christian priests
with them.

02:02:51.248 --> 02:02:53.479
Wulf. You stay here
with the troops.

02:02:53.481 --> 02:02:55.747
Tomorrow you'll lead
them to Dorestad.

02:02:55.749 --> 02:02:57.816
With or without me.
Gebbe.

02:02:58.181 --> 02:02:59.181
Come.

02:03:01.414 --> 02:03:02.682
Come.

02:03:19.249 --> 02:03:20.717
Stop!

02:03:21.349 --> 02:03:23.849
Stop this madness!

02:03:27.082 --> 02:03:31.049
- Stay back!
- Stop this madness!

02:03:41.049 --> 02:03:43.317
Come on, come on!

02:03:58.749 --> 02:03:59.750
No!

02:04:05.815 --> 02:04:08.315
They cannot
destroy our world.

02:04:12.915 --> 02:04:15.181
They cannot
destroy our world.

02:04:16.881 --> 02:04:18.881
You know who you are.

02:04:42.182 --> 02:04:44.113
Forward!

02:04:54.414 --> 02:04:55.815
Attention!

02:05:02.049 --> 02:05:04.182
I know who's
to blame for this.

02:05:05.482 --> 02:05:06.816
Redbad's wife.

02:05:08.282 --> 02:05:09.916
She is a Christian.

02:05:11.882 --> 02:05:12.847
That is ridiculous.

02:05:12.849 --> 02:05:15.080
I have seen her
conspire with the priests.

02:05:15.082 --> 02:05:17.149
She was praying in
one of their churches.

02:05:18.314 --> 02:05:20.479
Redbad, tell them
that this is nonsense.

02:05:20.481 --> 02:05:22.379
She has nothing
to do with it.

02:05:22.381 --> 02:05:24.914
She is to
blame for all of it.

02:05:32.415 --> 02:05:33.949
So she's a Christian?

02:05:38.914 --> 02:05:41.016
It's not about
what you believe.

02:05:42.480 --> 02:05:44.714
It's about
what you do with it.

02:05:46.881 --> 02:05:49.280
Give us Redbad
and his wife,

02:05:49.282 --> 02:05:51.281
and we will leave you alone.

02:06:02.481 --> 02:06:03.682
Fenne.

02:06:05.715 --> 02:06:06.846
It's no use.

02:06:06.848 --> 02:06:09.012
Let's leave in peace.

02:06:09.014 --> 02:06:10.681
We won't hurt you.

02:06:31.048 --> 02:06:33.112
Take the three of them.

02:06:33.114 --> 02:06:35.316
And take down
that Pagan tree.

02:07:23.814 --> 02:07:26.145
He does bring luck,
that God of yours.

02:07:26.147 --> 02:07:28.147
It's not about luck.

02:07:29.779 --> 02:07:33.214
Or about God making
life easier for people.

02:07:34.146 --> 02:07:36.214
Then what good
does it do?

02:07:39.014 --> 02:07:42.248
Jesus said you should
love your enemies.

02:07:44.813 --> 02:07:46.814
He must've been crazy.

02:07:49.413 --> 02:07:51.980
Jesus knew he had been
betrayed to the Romans.

02:07:53.914 --> 02:07:57.948
And yet he let himself be
captured, and be killed.

02:07:59.914 --> 02:08:02.045
Why?

02:08:02.047 --> 02:08:04.781
He wanted to show his
friends that he loved them.

02:08:13.181 --> 02:08:14.913
You still love him.

02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:23.247
I could never have
given him a child.

02:08:27.381 --> 02:08:29.648
Perhaps it just
had to be this way.

02:08:45.146 --> 02:08:48.011
You have betrayed Redbad.

02:08:48.013 --> 02:08:51.278
- Oh, yes, have I?
- You have betrayed me!

02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:54.144
I have saved our people
from a huge defeat.

02:08:54.146 --> 02:08:56.243
A defeat?
Everyone is ready.

02:08:56.245 --> 02:08:58.346
The Danes are
just off the coast.

02:08:59.145 --> 02:09:01.014
Let them stay there.

02:09:04.213 --> 02:09:05.944
Father...

02:09:05.946 --> 02:09:08.410
We can still
catch up to them.

02:09:08.412 --> 02:09:10.413
Do you want
to free Redbad?

02:09:11.912 --> 02:09:14.013
Is that what
you really want?

02:09:16.747 --> 02:09:18.847
We arrange this
with Charles Martel.

02:09:22.779 --> 02:09:25.314
For the first time we are powerful
enough to defeat the Franks.

02:09:26.713 --> 02:09:27.748
Are we?

02:09:29.114 --> 02:09:31.981
And who will
lead that attack?

02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:37.780
Go, then.

02:09:39.213 --> 02:09:43.777
Go to them. And tell them
we're going to play soldiers.

02:09:43.779 --> 02:09:46.377
Because you feel
you must prove yourself.

02:09:46.379 --> 02:09:49.014
Make one mistake, and
they'll torture you alive.

02:09:50.914 --> 02:09:53.744
You don't
stand a chance.

02:09:53.746 --> 02:09:57.143
Not even if you were a hundred
times better than Redbad.

02:09:57.145 --> 02:10:00.648
You just never considered
that I could be a good leader.

02:10:02.146 --> 02:10:05.948
That I would be able to
lead our people to victory.

02:10:06.847 --> 02:10:08.947
That I could be like...

02:10:12.945 --> 02:10:15.013
Why are you
not supporting me?

02:10:24.146 --> 02:10:26.444
Tell the Danes
we no longer need them.

02:10:28.978 --> 02:10:32.912
We're going to Utrecht.
To negotiate with Charles Martel.

02:10:45.212 --> 02:10:46.214
Halt.

02:11:02.779 --> 02:11:03.945
No, no.

02:11:03.947 --> 02:11:06.010
No, don't touch him.

02:11:06.012 --> 02:11:08.078
- Give him to me!
- No! No!

02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:09.211
Stop!

02:11:09.213 --> 02:11:10.880
Please! Please!

02:11:11.346 --> 02:11:12.381
Stop!

02:11:13.112 --> 02:11:14.813
Give him to me!

02:11:15.913 --> 02:11:16.913
No!

02:11:17.714 --> 02:11:18.714
Poppo!

02:11:30.180 --> 02:11:31.280
Redbad?

02:11:32.846 --> 02:11:33.980
Redbad?

02:11:36.312 --> 02:11:37.646
How cozy.

02:11:38.180 --> 02:11:39.713
A family reunion.

02:12:00.278 --> 02:12:01.379
Redbad!

02:12:19.011 --> 02:12:21.910
I wanted to get a closer look at
the man who everybody talks about.

02:12:21.912 --> 02:12:23.413
The great Redbad.

02:12:28.312 --> 02:12:30.312
We have to give the people

02:12:31.078 --> 02:12:33.780
what the people want.

02:12:35.245 --> 02:12:37.343
Nice fairy tales
about heroes,

02:12:37.345 --> 02:12:41.146
and dark fairy tales
about God.

02:12:43.745 --> 02:12:45.744
Hmm.

02:12:45.746 --> 02:12:47.844
Our fathers believe that,
while we don't,

02:12:47.846 --> 02:12:51.046
so let's keep that a secret.

02:12:52.411 --> 02:12:53.646
For us,

02:12:54.746 --> 02:12:56.813
it doesn't matter
what's up there,

02:12:58.179 --> 02:12:59.712
because around here,

02:13:00.446 --> 02:13:01.847
we rule,

02:13:04.245 --> 02:13:06.279
and we do as we please.

02:13:10.145 --> 02:13:12.142
Maybe we do.

02:13:12.144 --> 02:13:15.278
Or maybe our fathers understood
something we still have yet to learn.

02:13:18.977 --> 02:13:21.243
But that's the problem,
isn't it?

02:13:21.245 --> 02:13:23.878
You're too smart
to really believe that.

02:13:25.345 --> 02:13:26.346
So...

02:13:28.412 --> 02:13:30.043
just play along,

02:13:30.045 --> 02:13:31.911
and I'll let you live.

02:13:33.078 --> 02:13:35.142
Oppose me
and I'll kill you

02:13:35.144 --> 02:13:37.212
and your cute little family.

02:13:39.011 --> 02:13:40.079
Understood?

02:15:17.977 --> 02:15:19.045
Redbad,

02:15:20.344 --> 02:15:22.809
do you forsake the devil

02:15:22.811 --> 02:15:25.241
and all his works?

02:15:25.243 --> 02:15:28.741
Do you forsake
the Pagan gods,

02:15:28.743 --> 02:15:30.878
Woden, Donar,

02:15:32.043 --> 02:15:33.045
Freya...

02:15:34.310 --> 02:15:36.212
Yes or no?

02:15:37.811 --> 02:15:38.879
Huh?

02:15:53.711 --> 02:15:54.712
Yes.

02:16:05.943 --> 02:16:08.442
Then step into the water,

02:16:08.444 --> 02:16:12.277
and I shall baptize you in
the name of the Holy Spirit.

02:16:27.744 --> 02:16:30.245
On your knees.
On your knees.

02:16:35.378 --> 02:16:37.012
Do you believe

02:16:37.777 --> 02:16:39.778
in the one true God?

02:16:40.710 --> 02:16:42.178
The Almighty Father,

02:16:43.442 --> 02:16:46.708
and his son,
Jesus Christ,

02:16:46.709 --> 02:16:48.744
and the Holy Spirit?

02:16:49.776 --> 02:16:51.144
Yes or no?

02:16:59.409 --> 02:17:01.273
Do you believe

02:17:01.276 --> 02:17:03.311
in that one true God?

02:17:04.410 --> 02:17:07.406
In the Almighty Father,
and his Son?

02:17:07.409 --> 02:17:10.441
<i>Throw away everything
that unites our people?</i>

02:17:10.443 --> 02:17:13.308
<i>Our traditions,
our practices, our customs?</i>

02:17:13.311 --> 02:17:14.645
<i>Yes or no?</i>

02:17:21.244 --> 02:17:22.245
Yes?

02:17:22.777 --> 02:17:23.844
Or no?

02:17:28.477 --> 02:17:29.745
Huh?

02:17:37.911 --> 02:17:41.208
Do you believe
in that one true God?

02:17:41.209 --> 02:17:43.041
The Almighty father...

02:17:43.044 --> 02:17:46.343
<i>I've given you every opportunity
to be the leader you want to be.</i>

02:17:47.777 --> 02:17:49.311
...and in the Holy Spirit?

02:17:49.943 --> 02:17:51.977
Yes or no?

02:17:55.110 --> 02:17:58.308
<i>Redbad, it's not about you,</i>

02:17:58.309 --> 02:18:00.709
<i>and it's not about me.</i>

02:18:00.710 --> 02:18:05.977
<i>It's about our people, and
the interest of our nation.</i>

02:18:07.242 --> 02:18:10.777
<i>Now stand up, Redbad.
Rise.</i>

02:18:15.277 --> 02:18:17.709
Yes or no?

02:18:21.775 --> 02:18:23.808
Will I go to heaven then?

02:18:25.443 --> 02:18:27.943
Just answer my question.

02:18:31.209 --> 02:18:34.643
You want to baptize me,
so then will I go to heaven?

02:18:37.343 --> 02:18:40.840
Every good Christian
will go to heaven.

02:18:40.842 --> 02:18:42.941
- Do you believe in...
- And my ancestors?

02:18:42.943 --> 02:18:45.308
What about
your ancestors?

02:18:45.309 --> 02:18:49.378
Will I see them in heaven if I'm baptized?
My own father?

02:18:50.476 --> 02:18:54.240
Your father
was not baptized.

02:18:54.242 --> 02:18:57.009
But I will see him
in heaven, right?

02:18:57.011 --> 02:18:59.074
He was not
a Christian.

02:18:59.075 --> 02:19:01.973
But he was a good person.

02:19:01.975 --> 02:19:06.307
A brave man, who gave his
life for his people.

02:19:06.308 --> 02:19:10.873
He was a heathen!
He was a heathen!

02:19:10.875 --> 02:19:15.110
And heathens do not go to heaven.
They cannot. It's impossible.

02:19:15.843 --> 02:19:17.943
And Sietse, son of Boed?

02:19:20.443 --> 02:19:22.410
Hille, son of Reider?

02:19:23.808 --> 02:19:25.876
Maike, daughter of Taeke?

02:19:26.910 --> 02:19:30.974
Your fathers, your sons,

02:19:30.976 --> 02:19:34.307
your daughters, all
honorable men and women,

02:19:34.308 --> 02:19:36.441
who died for their people.

02:19:36.442 --> 02:19:38.772
Is there a place for them
in Christianity?

02:19:38.775 --> 02:19:42.275
You can
pray for their souls.

02:19:42.277 --> 02:19:43.773
Yes or no?

02:19:45.177 --> 02:19:46.708
No.

02:19:46.709 --> 02:19:49.307
- Yes or no?
- No, of course not.

02:19:49.309 --> 02:19:52.473
Why would I convert
to such a religion, then?

02:19:52.475 --> 02:19:54.740
Why don't you grab him.

02:19:54.742 --> 02:19:56.808
so thought I could
break his will

02:19:56.810 --> 02:19:58.940
and get him baptized.

02:19:58.942 --> 02:20:02.407
Our fathers may not have been
gods, but they were our fathers.

02:20:02.409 --> 02:20:04.174
Yes!

02:20:04.176 --> 02:20:07.273
And I would rather be
in hell with my friends,

02:20:07.275 --> 02:20:09.406
than in Heaven
with my enemies.

02:20:09.408 --> 02:20:11.143
Yes!

02:20:12.942 --> 02:20:14.076
Redbad!

02:20:19.410 --> 02:20:21.277
Come with me now.
We're leaving for Dorestad.

02:20:27.076 --> 02:20:28.076
Attack!

02:20:33.110 --> 02:20:35.709
For Redbad!

02:20:42.275 --> 02:20:44.342
Jurre! Jurre!
Let's go!

02:20:49.043 --> 02:20:50.343
Jurre!

02:20:51.775 --> 02:20:53.409
- Let's go!
- No!

02:21:28.175 --> 02:21:30.276
We should've done this
a long time ago.

02:21:55.308 --> 02:21:56.342
No.

02:21:57.475 --> 02:21:58.776
No.

02:22:05.276 --> 02:22:07.276
This truly belongs
to you.

02:22:10.443 --> 02:22:12.010
Hey.

02:22:14.242 --> 02:22:16.374
It belongs to us.

02:23:08.940 --> 02:23:10.942
Redbad. Redbad.

02:23:12.907 --> 02:23:15.905
He got away to Dorestad.

02:23:15.907 --> 02:23:18.974
- It's a trap.
- Of course, it's a trap.

02:23:20.475 --> 02:23:22.807
Did you do what
I've asked you to do?

02:23:22.809 --> 02:23:24.173
Everything's ready.

02:23:24.175 --> 02:23:25.175
Redbad.

02:23:26.909 --> 02:23:27.943
They have Poppo.

02:23:39.141 --> 02:23:40.142
It's time.

02:24:21.740 --> 02:24:24.272
Pater noster...

02:24:24.274 --> 02:24:26.241
May the Lord be with you.

02:24:26.807 --> 02:24:27.841
Amen.

02:25:00.374 --> 02:25:02.473
Don't you want to wait
for the light?

02:25:02.475 --> 02:25:04.675
Is everyone ready?

02:25:06.275 --> 02:25:07.275
What now?

02:25:08.808 --> 02:25:10.939
We wait
just a little while longer.

02:25:10.941 --> 02:25:12.942
He knows
what he's doing.

02:25:13.741 --> 02:25:14.906
Usually.

02:25:14.908 --> 02:25:15.942
Torches.

02:25:16.207 --> 02:25:17.209
Fire up.

02:25:25.474 --> 02:25:28.174
Redbad, we don't stand
a chance without the Danes.

02:25:29.407 --> 02:25:31.707
We have little choice.

02:25:36.441 --> 02:25:38.708
What do you want to do?

02:25:39.741 --> 02:25:41.675
- Straw?
- Everything's ready.

02:25:54.808 --> 02:25:57.238
A sign from God!

02:25:57.240 --> 02:25:59.906
Redbad, what's happening?

02:25:59.908 --> 02:26:01.008
Stay in line.

02:26:02.239 --> 02:26:03.407
On the formation.

02:26:05.939 --> 02:26:08.707
- It's an ill omen.
- Yes, but for whom?

02:26:11.906 --> 02:26:13.072
Oh, God...

02:26:15.939 --> 02:26:18.005
It's the fifth full moon
of the year.

02:26:18.007 --> 02:26:20.237
You knew this was
going to happen.

02:26:20.239 --> 02:26:21.273
Idwina.

02:26:26.474 --> 02:26:27.674
Warriors!

02:26:30.174 --> 02:26:31.407
Is this a sign?

02:26:32.707 --> 02:26:33.741
Perhaps.

02:26:34.908 --> 02:26:37.008
Is it an ill omen?

02:26:37.441 --> 02:26:38.241
It might be.

02:26:40.474 --> 02:26:43.841
Are we going to die today?
Probably.

02:26:45.708 --> 02:26:48.771
But I know
one thing for certain.

02:26:48.773 --> 02:26:53.204
We won't let anyone tell us
how to live our lives,

02:26:53.206 --> 02:26:55.240
or what we should believe.

02:26:56.474 --> 02:26:57.842
No king,

02:26:58.773 --> 02:27:00.705
no priest,

02:27:00.707 --> 02:27:04.237
not even the Sun
or the Moon.

02:27:04.239 --> 02:27:09.073
Because this is the land of
free people, who bow to no one.

02:27:10.473 --> 02:27:14.172
This is the land
of our ancestors.

02:27:14.174 --> 02:27:17.205
Of the people we love.

02:27:17.207 --> 02:27:21.272
That's what unites us. And no
one can take that from us.

02:27:23.239 --> 02:27:25.838
So if you
want to live freely,

02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:27.375
or die freely,

02:27:28.274 --> 02:27:29.771
then follow me!

02:27:32.405 --> 02:27:33.673
Redbad!

02:28:02.939 --> 02:28:04.041
Formation.

02:28:06.774 --> 02:28:07.774
Break your line.

02:28:20.873 --> 02:28:21.940
Formation.

02:28:31.274 --> 02:28:32.340
Stay in line.

02:28:34.139 --> 02:28:35.241
Stay!

02:28:46.007 --> 02:28:47.108
Get ready.

02:29:04.872 --> 02:29:05.873
Open the gate.

02:29:36.306 --> 02:29:38.374
Well, General,
let's start it.

02:29:39.006 --> 02:29:40.040
Yes, my Lord.

02:30:05.805 --> 02:30:06.839
Psst!

02:30:21.440 --> 02:30:22.769
Who's that?

02:30:22.771 --> 02:30:24.837
I think they're attacking,
my Lord.

02:30:24.839 --> 02:30:26.936
Order the front lines
to attack.

02:30:26.938 --> 02:30:28.469
Front lines, attack!

02:31:41.138 --> 02:31:42.205
Redbad!

02:31:42.905 --> 02:31:44.203
You're late.

02:31:44.205 --> 02:31:46.969
Chase the pigs into
the city now.

02:31:46.971 --> 02:31:48.068
Are you sure,
my Lord?

02:31:48.070 --> 02:31:50.339
Pig fat burns for hours.
That will clean things up.

02:32:10.137 --> 02:32:12.372
Redbad! Dorestad.

02:32:16.771 --> 02:32:18.238
Open the gate!

02:32:21.105 --> 02:32:24.272
Get in.

02:32:31.304 --> 02:32:33.638
Redbad, they have Poppo.

02:32:34.405 --> 02:32:36.140
Frea, Frea.

02:32:40.372 --> 02:32:41.373
Poppo.

02:32:43.806 --> 02:32:44.973
It's all right.

02:33:12.938 --> 02:33:16.006
No! No!

02:33:23.071 --> 02:33:24.138
Oh, no.

02:34:09.304 --> 02:34:11.372
General, aim for the child.

02:34:33.804 --> 02:34:35.869
Is this still about
your father?

02:34:35.871 --> 02:34:37.872
Those are the laws of war.

02:34:43.437 --> 02:34:44.704
You fool!

02:34:46.038 --> 02:34:49.205
Soldier!
A horse! A horse!

02:34:51.303 --> 02:34:53.671
We could have
ruled the world.

02:35:15.704 --> 02:35:18.170
No!

02:35:34.903 --> 02:35:35.903
Fenne.

02:35:43.770 --> 02:35:45.071
You're so brave.

02:35:51.805 --> 02:35:53.137
You're so brave.

02:35:58.004 --> 02:35:59.005
Fenne.

02:36:16.304 --> 02:36:19.069
What have we done?

02:36:19.071 --> 02:36:22.335
Son, God is good,
and...

02:36:22.337 --> 02:36:24.902
We have to get of here,
come on.

02:36:24.904 --> 02:36:26.371
Come on, come on.
