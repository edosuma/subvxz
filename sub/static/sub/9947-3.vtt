00:00.199 --> 00:02.156
It's okay. Mom's here.

00:02.436 --> 00:03.781
??

00:03.782 --> 00:05.580
- Liam!
- I mean it.

00:05.667 --> 00:07.744
I heard a whisper
that frank's missing.

00:07.745 --> 00:09.748
When was the last time you saw him?

00:09.749 --> 00:11.390
Bastards!

00:11.391 --> 00:14.201
Liam and stella are my babies.
And they should be with me.

00:14.202 --> 00:19.505
What the fuck am I doing here?
And where is here?

00:20.226 --> 00:24.190
Anyone watching thinking we know
fuck all

00:24.191 --> 00:27.289
about knowing fuck all about owt,

00:27.290 --> 00:29.063
needs to watch their back...

00:29.064 --> 00:32.204
So you've had your labour,
reclassifying skunk,

00:32.205 --> 00:35.364
sending prices sky-high,
literally, literally taking

00:35.365 --> 00:38.539
the grass from its own roots!

00:38.540 --> 00:40.678
And now you've got
your condem nation.

00:40.679 --> 00:44.863
Liberals noshing tories like
altar boys picking dimps up!

00:44.864 --> 00:48.689
Have we had a national
fucking stroke or what?.

00:48.690 --> 00:52.265
Is revolution a word,
or was it never?.

00:52.266 --> 00:55.952
Anybody watching needs to know,
we cope better than average

00:55.953 --> 00:57.606
with irony in chatsworth.

00:57.607 --> 01:01.028
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in manchester,

01:01.029 --> 01:04.778
and they charge us for water!

01:04.779 --> 01:09.122
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found.

01:09.123 --> 01:12.951
This green and pleasant land
in ancient times.

01:12.952 --> 01:14.965
Yak yak yak yak yak yak yak yak yak!

01:14.966 --> 01:18.228
It's not theirs any more.

01:18.229 --> 01:20.641
This is our england now.

01:21.953 --> 01:24.933
Paaaarty!

01:26.281 --> 01:32.131
This programme contains very
strong language from the start,

01:32.132 --> 01:33.963
scenes of a sexual nature
and violence.

01:33.964 --> 01:36.717
Grinding

01:36.718 --> 01:39.960
stay in school, kids.
Don't die of ignorance.

01:41.028 --> 01:43.997
Just say no.

01:51.881 --> 01:53.803
Checkmate!

01:58.013 --> 02:03.169
Shane maguire. Fighting for
peace and unity in our community.

02:09.788 --> 02:12.552
'You know, when I was at school,
not that I went much,

02:12.553 --> 02:16.045
'they asked me what
I wanted to be when I grew up.

02:16.046 --> 02:19.315
'And I wrote down "jamie maguire".

02:19.316 --> 02:22.332
"They told me I didn't understand
the assignment,

02:22.333 --> 02:25.353
'and I told them I did.

02:25.354 --> 02:26.514
'Perfectly.

02:26.515 --> 02:28.909
'You see those that can, do.

02:28.910 --> 02:31.924
'And hose that can't?.
Jog on, knobheads.'

02:31.925 --> 02:35.597
the school contract's too risky,
and it's shit money.

02:35.598 --> 02:37.176
Hear him out.

02:37.177 --> 02:39.188
With these, today,
saint morrissey's comp.

02:39.189 --> 02:42.606
Tomorrow,
every school in a 50-mile radius.

02:42.607 --> 02:44.262
All thanks to this fucking genius.

02:44.263 --> 02:46.418
I directed it.

02:46.419 --> 02:47.522
Pass us those sausages, son.

02:46.419 --> 02:50.647
Pass us those sausages, son.
We already make triple from security
jobs for building sites,

02:50.648 --> 02:52.849
and they don't bring the police
to our door.

02:52.850 --> 02:54.102
Working with kids. Crb check.

02:54.103 --> 02:56.337
Working with kids. Crb check.
We've been careful
to tell the truth.

02:56.338 --> 02:58.469
Even if we've had to make it up.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.143
Gonna finish that?.

03:00.144 --> 03:01.899
Hot off the counterfeit press.

03:01.900 --> 03:04.295
I've told 'em, we vet our own staff,

03:04.296 --> 03:05.957
and it saves them money having
to do their own checks.

03:05.958 --> 03:08.344
Who'll be collecting while
you're fucking around in schools?

03:08.345 --> 03:09.223
Who'll be collecting while
you're fucking around in schools?
I'll get staff.

03:09.224 --> 03:11.942
Pay is not enough to cover costs
for staff, shane.

03:18.499 --> 03:22.322
He's right. We can't afford it.

03:22.323 --> 03:24.029
Sorry.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.049
What's that in aid of?

03:29.050 --> 03:30.620
A new kitchen.

03:32.481 --> 03:33.550
With the wedding money.

03:33.551 --> 03:35.707
With the wedding money.
A new kitchen
won't bring frank back.

03:35.708 --> 03:38.675
We don't want him back.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.965
You should've let that beastly
monica take the whole clan

03:42.966 --> 03:44.228
while you had the chance.

03:44.229 --> 03:47.676
Now we're left living like paupers
in this shithole,

03:47.677 --> 03:50.533
looking after their kids.
It's madness.

03:50.534 --> 03:53.840
I am making the best
of a bad situation.

03:53.841 --> 03:58.301
It's not too late. You have all
that money, don't waste it.

03:59.367 --> 04:03.124
We can leave, buy our own place.
A fresh start. You and me.

04:03.125 --> 04:06.540
We're getting a new kitchen.
It's my destiny!

04:06.541 --> 04:08.692
We're getting a fucking kitchen!

04:11.696 --> 04:15.704
Oh, baby, I am sorry to shout.

04:15.705 --> 04:16.740
Oh, baby, I am sorry to shout.
Sponge bath!

04:21.576 --> 04:25.105
"Dear timmy,
I'm sorry your dirty protest

04:25.106 --> 04:28.743
"for our rights to a conjugal
didn't work. Bastards.

04:28.744 --> 04:32.219
"I hope this sexy picture of me
murdered like one of your victims,

04:32.220 --> 04:37.409
"as requested in you last letter,
makes it past the prison guards

04:37.410 --> 04:39.802
"and brings you warmth
in your lonely isolation.

04:39.803 --> 04:42.978
"Kiss, kiss. Micky maguire."

04:42.979 --> 04:46.383
You've not long suffered a major
heart attack and, to be blunt,

04:46.384 --> 04:47.443
I'm concerned.

04:47.444 --> 04:50.592
When someone's gone through what
you have, they can go two ways.

04:50.593 --> 04:55.428
Wrap themselves in cotton wool
and live like a nun, or like you,

04:55.429 --> 04:57.581
seize the day.

04:57.582 --> 04:59.627
Neither work.
Both end up dead as a dodo.

04:59.628 --> 05:01.731
I've seen it hundreds of times.

05:01.732 --> 05:04.992
Doctors'll tell you if you can't
do things in moderation, abstain.

05:04.993 --> 05:07.399
Well, I say fuck that and fuck them.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.632
I can give you a few healthy
lifestyle options,

05:09.633 --> 05:11.213
give you a good balance,

05:11.214 --> 05:13.809
so you're not giving up
everything you love.

05:15.045 --> 05:18.132
And by the time I'm done,
you'll outlive all of us.

05:18.133 --> 05:19.879
And what qualifies you, like?

05:19.880 --> 05:21.724
Healthcare receptionist
for ten years.

05:21.725 --> 05:23.183
I'm practically a certified gp.

05:23.184 --> 05:25.599
And...

05:26.920 --> 05:28.615
I only charge a fiver a sesh.

05:33.208 --> 05:34.676
Duty calls.

05:34.677 --> 05:36.930
Legs in the air time for me,
early night for you.

05:36.931 --> 05:38.936
School in the morning.

05:38.937 --> 05:40.438
Nah, it were a shit idea.

05:40.439 --> 05:41.588
Cos jamie said?

05:41.589 --> 05:44.571
I can't believe you're even working
for him after he fucked you over,

05:44.572 --> 05:47.541
fucked us all over.
Now he's got the business, this pub,

05:47.542 --> 05:51.354
and he'll probably take everything
we've got, if you let him.

05:51.355 --> 05:54.754
Fiancee's jilted me. Ran off
on his stag night, god knows where.

05:54.755 --> 05:57.227
I'm thinking of suing him
for breach of promise.

05:57.228 --> 05:59.368
Got to catch the bastard first.

06:02.016 --> 06:03.166
Aren't you hot?.

06:03.167 --> 06:04.939
Hotter than a peppered fart.

Yeah... no.

06:16.438 --> 06:20.643
Libby? I need the toilet.

06:20.644 --> 06:22.966
How did you get to be so bold?

06:24.837 --> 06:30.094
How do you become... so confident?.

06:31.242 --> 06:33.858
So unselfconscious?

06:33.859 --> 06:37.821
I'm touching cloth, libby.

06:37.822 --> 06:43.962
I have been living like a fucking
stepford wife since the age of five!

06:43.963 --> 06:46.276
(Sobs)

06:46.277 --> 06:49.566
Hey, eh, eh!

06:51.016 --> 06:52.852
Men are like a pack of cards.

06:52.853 --> 06:56.343
You need a heart to love 'em,
a diamond to marry 'em,

06:56.344 --> 07:01.504
a club to whack 'em,
and a spade to bury the fuckers.

07:01.505 --> 07:04.359
Useless pigs.

07:04.360 --> 07:07.119
From now on,
my romantic night in will be

07:07.120 --> 07:11.790
a bottle of wine for foreplay,
and the four-finger boogie

07:11.791 --> 07:13.180
to finish me off.

07:14.943 --> 07:17.908
Well, I've found there's only so
long I can go without a shag.

07:17.909 --> 07:20.643
You know, a proper shag.
Anyone'd do me.

07:20.644 --> 07:23.546
Especially the new priest at church,
father dooley.

07:24.838 --> 07:28.070
Religion's never been so sexy!

07:31.846 --> 07:33.375
Who's that?.

07:33.376 --> 07:36.424
Poco, me ex. He was a scouser.
D'you know him?

07:36.425 --> 07:39.839
As fucked up as that question is,
I do, as it happens.

07:39.840 --> 07:44.214
He used to sell weed from the back
of a caravan,

07:44.215 --> 07:46.542
and every time he sold an ounce,
he'd go...

07:46.543 --> 07:50.674
(Both) "Buzzin' laughin',
toffee apple kidda!"

07:55.667 --> 08:00.045
(All) Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

08:00.046 --> 08:02.446
Laughing

08:07.135 --> 08:10.037
drip the hot wax into the water,
and whatever shape it makes

08:10.038 --> 08:12.735
will show your heart's desire.

08:16.582 --> 08:17.799
Ah, it's a butterfly.

08:23.732 --> 08:26.679
It looks like a cock!

08:33.207 --> 08:36.326
Looks like a minge!

08:36.327 --> 08:38.118
Laughter

08:38.119 --> 08:40.929
it's only a bit of fun.

08:42.678 --> 08:45.079
Wind blows

08:57.762 --> 09:00.334

10:02.969 --> 10:05.904
I fucking warned you. Behave!

10:09.951 --> 10:12.398
How do you feel about mentoring?

10:13.416 --> 10:16.078
There's a year seven pupil -
jude kendo.

10:16.079 --> 10:19.670
He's really bright, lots of promise,
but he's been having problems.

10:19.671 --> 10:23.931
Lacks confidence,
bullied mercilessly.

10:23.932 --> 10:25.742
And?

10:27.908 --> 10:31.212
We've got an idea who's targeting
him, but jude won't tell.

10:31.213 --> 10:33.414
He could really benefit
from someone like you.

10:33.415 --> 10:36.956
There's a small fee available
from the mentoring association.

10:36.957 --> 10:40.091
His name's jude? And he's ginger?.

10:40.092 --> 10:42.932
Jude the ginge? Ginger judy?

10:42.933 --> 10:45.220
Poor bastard!

Whirring and bleeping

something from the shops

11:32.394 --> 11:34.224

11:45.646 --> 11:47.900
Who are they, I can't see!

11:47.901 --> 11:49.160
What's going on? Over.

11:47.901 --> 11:51.011
What's going on? Over.
"They're in the ceiling shafts!"

11:59.275 --> 12:00.433
Nice one.

12:03.162 --> 12:04.603
What the fuck?

12:07.943 --> 12:09.123
For emergencies.

12:09.124 --> 12:10.460
What kind of emergencies?

12:09.120 --> 12:13.703
What kind of emergencies?
I dunno, if some little twat goes
psycho with a knife or summat?.

12:13.704 --> 12:16.417
It stays in the locker.
Last resort only.

12:28.338 --> 12:29.779
Don't you ever knock?

12:29.780 --> 12:32.367
Don't you ever knock?
You haven't been turning up
for our power walks.

12:32.368 --> 12:35.734
And I'm sure I saw you at the shop
earlier, you looked at me

12:35.735 --> 12:36.348
and you ran off.

12:36.349 --> 12:38.483
And you ran off.
Wasn't me.

12:38.484 --> 12:42.197
Anyway, the boys got me some stuff,
they're looking after me now, see.

12:43.859 --> 12:44.708
You ok?

12:44.709 --> 12:47.287
You ok?
I'm tired.

12:47.288 --> 12:48.480
Shattered meself.

12:48.481 --> 12:50.473
I've not had a decent night's kip

12:50.474 --> 12:53.063
since I slapped a sex ban
on jackson.

13:03.232 --> 13:04.366
Meems?

13:05.553 --> 13:08.947
I just popped in to ask if you could
give us a hand with some painting.

13:08.948 --> 13:11.144
I think it'll be a really
good exercise,

13:11.145 --> 13:12.735
just a few skirting boards.

13:12.736 --> 13:14.631
Why are you so interested in me?

13:14.632 --> 13:15.664
I care.

13:16.925 --> 13:18.526
You still owe me a fiver.

13:18.527 --> 13:20.263
Pay me later.

13:28.916 --> 13:30.922
Oi, you little fuckers!

13:30.923 --> 13:33.311
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
it's all right, ches.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.573
Ches, it's just fight club.

13:35.574 --> 13:39.633
I can stop 'em kicking the crap
out of each other on the playground,

13:39.634 --> 13:42.930
but they're only gonna fight
after school. Then what?. Stabbed?

13:42.931 --> 13:45.326
Shot in a park for being "dissed"
in the classroom?

13:45.327 --> 13:47.567
Boys need to be boys,

13:47.568 --> 13:51.139
and this is a better way for 'em
to sort out their shit.

13:51.140 --> 13:53.471
Peters verses manning.

13:53.472 --> 13:55.334
Place your bets, place your bets.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.292
Dig deep, dig deep.

13:57.293 --> 13:59.634
Place your bets, lads.

13:59.635 --> 14:01.144
Who you going for?. Manning?

14:01.145 --> 14:03.074
I'll go manning.

14:03.075 --> 14:04.827
Thank you very much!

14:04.828 --> 14:07.899
I didn't know he'd be getting
parole. That's not the worst of it.

14:07.900 --> 14:10.068
He wants me to do all these
sick sex things with him

14:10.069 --> 14:14.144
which end up with me either dead
or him frying me cock in a pan.

14:14.145 --> 14:17.311
He knows me name,
where I live, everything.

14:17.312 --> 14:20.752
I got desperate, that's why
I started writing the letters.

14:20.753 --> 14:22.727
I just needed someone.

14:22.728 --> 14:24.160
You need to come out.

14:24.161 --> 14:26.068
Don't you think I've tried?

14:31.453 --> 14:32.213
Fish fingers for tea?

14:32.214 --> 14:33.119
Fish fingers for tea?
Yeah.

14:33.120 --> 14:34.967
Fish fingers for tea?
Yeah.
What you watching?

14:39.145 --> 14:42.040
I've seen this one.
The turtle gets twatted.

14:44.566 --> 14:46.883
I just think you need to
be more direct.

14:46.884 --> 14:50.278
But I can't say it. Every time I
try, the words just won't come out.

14:56.186 --> 14:57.627
Micky, pass the salt.

15:00.531 --> 15:03.462
By the sound of things,
you won't have to when he turns up.

15:03.463 --> 15:05.591
If I get found
dressed in suspenders,

15:05.592 --> 15:08.771
strangled by a pair of panty hose,
on your head be it.

15:15.208 --> 15:16.503
New clothes?

15:16.504 --> 15:17.173
New me.

15:17.174 --> 15:19.052
New me.
Same again, jay.

15:19.053 --> 15:22.890
Stick us down for paint-balling
as well. I can pay now.

15:25.544 --> 15:27.838
And, er...
Whatever she's having there.

15:29.468 --> 15:31.424
Double.

15:31.425 --> 15:32.254
Flush are we?

15:32.255 --> 15:35.195
Flush are we?
It's pay day. Shane's raking it in
at the school.

15:44.723 --> 15:46.221
Waiting for a hot date?

15:46.222 --> 15:47.491
A mate.

15:47.492 --> 15:48.890
Yeah, he's dead hard.

15:48.891 --> 15:51.782
Built like a brick shithouse
and mental.

15:51.783 --> 15:53.316
He'll fuck you up
if you take the piss.

15:53.305 --> 15:54.439
He'll fuck you up
if you take the piss.
Just asking.

15:54.440 --> 15:56.470
No, I mean I thought
we could use him,

15:56.471 --> 15:58.806
send him on hits what we need done.

15:58.807 --> 16:00.613
Sounds dangerous.

16:06.980 --> 16:08.315
Micky?

16:08.316 --> 16:10.212
Don't hurt me,
I'm with child!

16:14.263 --> 16:15.068
Who the fuck are you?

16:15.069 --> 16:16.775
Who the fuck are you?
Timmy.

16:18.037 --> 16:21.428
I don't wanna wear your bollocks
as earrings, that was me cell mate.

16:21.429 --> 16:23.627
You were writing to him,
but he's illiterate.

16:23.628 --> 16:25.489
I replied to your letters instead.

16:25.490 --> 16:27.502
I thought if you knew the truth,
you'd stop.

16:27.503 --> 16:30.557
I thought if you knew the truth,
you'd stop.
I should have known, the name's
a giveaway. Fucking timmy?

16:30.558 --> 16:32.439
I poured my heart out
in those letters.

16:32.440 --> 16:34.604
I poured my heart out
in those letters.
And they inspired me...
To be who I am.

16:34.605 --> 16:36.956
A twisted sex cannibal?

16:36.957 --> 16:38.123
Gay.

16:38.124 --> 16:39.941
But...I'm married.

16:44.841 --> 16:46.327
Does she know she's a beard?

16:44.841 --> 16:48.821
Does she know she's a beard?
I've tried to tell her.

16:48.822 --> 16:51.542
The words just won't come out.

16:51.543 --> 16:54.143
I wanna be like you. Out and proud.

16:58.455 --> 17:01.475
You need...Someone?

17:05.048 --> 17:07.390
And a place to stay?

17:07.391 --> 17:10.025
I can't face me wife. Not tonight.

17:15.907 --> 17:16.430
What's wrong?

17:16.431 --> 17:18.854
What's wrong?
You don't see it?.

17:18.855 --> 17:21.092
Your body's decent.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.207
Nice legs.

17:23.208 --> 17:26.645
Arse is...Pert...

17:26.646 --> 17:27.931
And round.

17:27.932 --> 17:29.937
Really top.

17:29.938 --> 17:32.470
Boobs...

17:33.586 --> 17:35.244
I, er...Need the bog.

17:38.887 --> 17:40.328
Thank you, carl.

17:41.404 --> 17:42.788
Micky.

17:42.789 --> 17:45.647
Micky.

17:45.648 --> 17:48.875
Me head's sticking to the carpet.

17:48.876 --> 17:49.659
Can I sleep in the bed wi' you?

17:49.660 --> 17:51.918
Can I sleep in the bed wi' you?
Go to sleep.

17:54.877 --> 17:55.909
Please.

17:57.791 --> 17:59.561
No funny business.

18:21.932 --> 18:23.283
Shhh!

18:27.984 --> 18:28.960
What's up?

18:28.961 --> 18:31.106
What's up?
Put a 50% cut of what you're
making into the family.

18:28.960 --> 18:33.525
What's up?
Put a 50% cut of what you're
making into the family.
You wanted nowt to do with it.

18:33.526 --> 18:36.296
That was before I knew
you've been pulling in a few more ton

18:36.297 --> 18:38.080
with your extra curricular.

18:38.081 --> 18:39.887
Come here, you little queer!

18:42.047 --> 18:44.322
(Other kids laugh)

18:44.323 --> 18:45.310
Is that the way you want it?.

18:45.311 --> 18:47.952
Is that the way you want it?.
Tough shit, this is mine
and kelly's. Shane!

18:55.231 --> 18:57.047
'I'm supposed to be your mentor.'

18:57.048 --> 19:00.342
not doing a very good job of it,
am I?

19:00.343 --> 19:02.158
Mentoring the wrong brother.

19:02.159 --> 19:05.963
A heads up on the evil twin
would have been nice, though.

19:05.964 --> 19:08.450
He's the one bullying you, in't he?
Did he do that?.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.382
What are you doing after school?

19:19.875 --> 19:22.339
Two words. Muttonn...

19:22.340 --> 19:24.133
I have two words for you.

19:24.134 --> 19:25.887
Nursing...Home.

19:25.888 --> 19:29.230
I'm not letting you take me to
the doctors dressed like a slapper.

19:29.231 --> 19:31.240
I'm not taking you anywhere.

19:32.384 --> 19:35.775
You're too old to be behaving
like a rebellious teenager.

19:35.776 --> 19:37.380
You think that's what men want?.

19:37.381 --> 19:39.549
What I want.

19:39.550 --> 19:42.813
Men want class, decency.

19:42.814 --> 19:45.043
I've more to offer than you,
even at my age.

19:45.044 --> 19:46.635
Oh?

19:46.636 --> 19:49.486
Boys, if you had to choose...

19:49.487 --> 19:52.529
This... or that?.

19:52.530 --> 19:53.774
Ridiculous.

19:53.775 --> 19:56.113
To make a fair point,
she may be disabled

19:56.114 --> 19:59.425
but she's still in perfect working
order, if you catch my drift.

19:59.426 --> 20:00.913
Disgusting.

20:03.726 --> 20:06.032
Drink at the jockey later?.

20:06.033 --> 20:09.404
A thank you for all your hard work.
Look after stella.

20:09.405 --> 20:09.916
Doctors!

20:09.917 --> 20:12.439
Doctors!
I have an appointment of my own.

20:12.440 --> 20:14.290
20 years overdue.

20:20.030 --> 20:21.234
That is, it's me dad!

20:20.030 --> 20:23.549
That is, it's me dad!
It's tramp sex. I told you.

20:23.550 --> 20:27.037
It's been making the rounds,
facebook, mobile phones.

20:27.038 --> 20:28.661
And look at the date.

20:28.662 --> 20:30.246
That was the stag night.

20:30.247 --> 20:32.691
Knew it. He's a fucking prick.

20:32.692 --> 20:35.079
We can email the poster
and find out more info,

20:35.080 --> 20:37.236
see if he's been spotted
anywhere else?

20:38.264 --> 20:39.995
Keep it between us though, yeah?

20:39.996 --> 20:44.764
Libby's just getting over me dad
doing one, so not a word. Not yet.

20:47.915 --> 20:49.937
Help, help!

20:49.938 --> 20:52.709
"No-one can hear you scream
in space."

20:53.615 --> 20:55.176
Libby?

20:55.177 --> 20:56.993
Thank fuck.

20:56.994 --> 20:58.912
What's goin' on,
how did I get here?

20:58.913 --> 21:01.467
What's goin' on,
how did I get here?
"They took you away in the night."

21:01.468 --> 21:02.963
Who?

21:02.964 --> 21:04.655
"They come out mostly at night.

21:05.611 --> 21:06.883
"Mostly."

21:10.704 --> 21:13.145
You're not libby.
'Fuck are ya?

21:19.016 --> 21:20.910
Who are ya?
Who are ya?

21:20.911 --> 21:22.157
Who are ya?

21:22.158 --> 21:24.892
Get away from me, ya bitch!

21:24.893 --> 21:26.823
Oh, shitting hell!

21:29.242 --> 21:31.171
Ah, it's got me! It's got me!

21:31.172 --> 21:32.707
It's got me.

21:32.708 --> 21:35.183
Ah, get off me. Get off me!

21:42.421 --> 21:45.438
Very therapeutical, painting.

21:45.439 --> 21:48.035
Give it nice long strokes.

21:52.772 --> 21:55.469
Don't stare too long.

21:55.470 --> 21:59.159
Jackson says it's got
hypnotic qualities.

22:00.340 --> 22:01.728
Lighten up.

22:01.729 --> 22:05.755
Stop touching me, you,
ya dirty dyke!

22:05.756 --> 22:08.963
Let's make one thing clear.
I love cock.

22:08.964 --> 22:11.616
Big cock, small cock, fat cock,
skinny cock, old cock,

22:11.617 --> 22:15.879
young cock, knobbly cock,
straight cock, all kinds, the lot!

22:15.880 --> 22:16.973
Shuttlecock?

22:18.834 --> 22:22.591
Ladies, check out my butterfly.

22:22.592 --> 22:23.548
You're all bloody at it!

22:23.549 --> 22:25.879
She's cock-a-hoop.

22:25.880 --> 22:27.850
I've always wanted one.

22:29.743 --> 22:30.995
It's lovely, libby.

22:30.996 --> 22:33.378
Why would you scar your own
body like that?.

22:33.379 --> 22:35.077
It's only a tattoo.

22:35.078 --> 22:37.330
It's a slag badge,
that's what it is.

22:37.331 --> 22:42.342
Wind your neck in, mother,
and stop following me around
like a sodding lapdog.

22:42.343 --> 22:44.773
Bless me, father, for I have sinned.

22:44.774 --> 22:47.491
It's been a week
since my last confession

22:47.492 --> 22:51.894
and the devil has gotten into
my soul and it panics me breathless.

22:51.895 --> 22:55.332
I've been having impure thoughts
about another woman.

22:55.333 --> 22:57.901
I dreamt she kissed me on the lips.

22:57.902 --> 23:02.802
Then, slowly moved along my body
with her tongue and then...

23:02.803 --> 23:03.759
Licked me...

23:03.760 --> 23:06.440
Downstairs.

23:06.441 --> 23:10.487
I only wanted a friend, and now
I don't know what's got into me.

23:10.488 --> 23:13.168
Tell me more.

23:13.169 --> 23:14.614
About the dream.

23:20.164 --> 23:21.484
You getting off on this?

23:21.485 --> 23:22.976
Oh, my god!

23:24.196 --> 23:27.353
Our father, who art in heaven

23:27.354 --> 23:32.102
hallowed be thy name,
thy kingdom come!

23:46.629 --> 23:49.053
For what she did to me,

23:49.054 --> 23:50.226
I could kill her.

23:50.227 --> 23:52.921
Comfortably.

23:52.922 --> 23:56.227
And I know she's ill, and I know
she can't help herself, and I know

23:56.228 --> 23:59.949
that if she was in
full control of her faculties
it wouldn't have happened,

23:59.950 --> 24:03.734
that what he did, whatever
buttonns he pushed to get her
where he wanted her, I know...

24:03.735 --> 24:07.651
If she was well,
it wouldn't have worked.

24:08.347 --> 24:10.673
But it did.

24:10.674 --> 24:12.871
And I've got this anger.

24:12.872 --> 24:17.404
This anger,
and I don't know what to do with it.

24:42.194 --> 24:43.924
Jude, relax it.

24:45.054 --> 24:46.364
There you go.

24:48.567 --> 24:50.003
Timmy, it's set.

24:50.004 --> 24:50.926
Tomorrow at mine.

24:50.927 --> 24:52.181
Neutral ground.

24:52.182 --> 24:53.612
I've made sure there'll
be no-one else in.

24:53.613 --> 24:55.253
But micky, we've got a little boy.

24:56.194 --> 24:58.916
Abort, abort!

25:01.766 --> 25:04.584
It's because of me son
that I have to do this.

25:04.585 --> 25:07.351
I want him to be as proud of me
as I am of him.

25:15.661 --> 25:19.476
We're on the same team, you dildo!

25:21.436 --> 25:23.894
It's not an excuse for what I did,

25:23.895 --> 25:26.700
and you've got every right to be
angry because I took everything

25:26.701 --> 25:30.755
we had and I just threw it back
in your face and I don't know why.

25:32.985 --> 25:35.046
And I know you don't believe me.

25:36.546 --> 25:37.684
But I've never...

25:39.445 --> 25:42.230
I've never loved
anybody like I love you.

25:42.231 --> 25:46.621
And the worst thing is,
because of me condition,

25:46.622 --> 25:49.275
I could end up hurting
you all over again.

25:50.664 --> 25:54.048
We could get to a place where
you could trust me...

25:54.049 --> 25:57.340
Where I could trust myself
and I could just fuck up.

25:59.037 --> 26:00.858
There's nothing I can do about it.

26:06.043 --> 26:09.846
Oi... I want you to start standing
up for yourself, ok?

26:11.026 --> 26:13.577
Take no shit, whatever the cost.

26:14.893 --> 26:15.575
What?.

26:15.576 --> 26:17.990
Don't mean you have to be physical.

26:17.991 --> 26:20.401
You're smart, aren't you?

26:20.402 --> 26:21.634
Use that.

26:21.635 --> 26:24.686
I tell ya,
scare tactics are just as effective.

26:31.315 --> 26:32.978
I do know what it's like, you know.

26:35.176 --> 26:38.989
My brother used to beat the shit
out of me when we were kids.

26:38.990 --> 26:41.699
Broke my arm once.

26:42.326 --> 26:44.455
Hated the fucker.

26:45.363 --> 26:47.355
Then he...

26:47.854 --> 26:50.815
He did something bad
and he got sent down.

26:56.243 --> 27:00.251
When he came out, he was like this
new person, you know, he'd changed.

27:01.801 --> 27:03.750
We were brothers again.

27:03.751 --> 27:04.730
But...

27:07.038 --> 27:09.547
He made me do something...

27:09.548 --> 27:10.504
Bad.

27:12.416 --> 27:13.747
He hadn't changed.

27:13.748 --> 27:16.141
He changed me.

27:16.142 --> 27:17.383
To be just like him.

27:18.747 --> 27:20.147
You can't let that happen.

27:48.669 --> 27:51.095
Loud knocking on door

27:51.096 --> 27:53.908
are you ready?

28:05.210 --> 28:06.166
Hiya.

28:11.867 --> 28:13.165
Sit, please.

28:14.742 --> 28:16.265
Can you er...

28:16.266 --> 28:17.279
Take little timmy?

28:17.280 --> 28:18.816
Take little timmy?
Come on, mate.

28:25.763 --> 28:29.076
I want you to know that I love you.

28:30.954 --> 28:33.717
Us, it was real.

28:33.718 --> 28:36.303
But I can't lie any more, linda.

28:38.312 --> 28:41.773
And I don't know how else to say
this to make it sound...

28:48.472 --> 28:50.294
I'm..

28:56.652 --> 28:58.029
I'm gay.

28:58.030 --> 28:59.328
I mean he's gay.

28:59.329 --> 29:00.821
We're both gay.

29:00.822 --> 29:03.726
Not with each other, though.

29:03.727 --> 29:04.558
I'm sorry.

29:06.055 --> 29:09.346
You home-wrecking faggot!

29:09.347 --> 29:11.107
I'm sorry.

29:11.108 --> 29:13.147
Should've fucking known.

29:13.148 --> 29:14.879
Bastard!

29:16.468 --> 29:17.609
You bastard!

29:17.610 --> 29:18.270
Bastard!

29:18.260 --> 29:18.897
Bastard!

29:18.898 --> 29:20.925
Why?

29:20.926 --> 29:22.732
Naughty, naughty daddy gay!

29:22.733 --> 29:24.224
Naughty, naughty daddy gay!

29:24.225 --> 29:26.039
Naughty, naughty daddy gay!

29:26.040 --> 29:26.996
Bastard!

29:28.641 --> 29:30.143
I've wrecked your family.

29:32.475 --> 29:33.796
I'm a coward.

29:35.848 --> 29:37.670
I'm finally free.

29:39.261 --> 29:40.524
Because of you.

29:40.525 --> 29:42.807
You're stronger than you think.

29:42.808 --> 29:45.378
I couldn't cope with
losing my family.

29:45.379 --> 29:46.665
It'd destroy me.

29:46.666 --> 29:50.571
I've been fighting with who I am
since I can remember.

29:50.572 --> 29:52.795
My family have only just found out.

29:52.796 --> 29:53.980
In time, they'll come round.

29:53.981 --> 29:55.732
In time, they'll come round.
What if they don't?.

29:57.277 --> 29:58.540
They deserved to know.

29:58.541 --> 30:01.475
Don't you think your family
deserves to know?

30:24.530 --> 30:26.466
Get out!

30:30.626 --> 30:33.069
Shane?

30:33.070 --> 30:35.017
Get 'em out, get everyone out!

30:35.018 --> 30:36.236
Shane!

30:37.579 --> 30:39.492
Alarm bell rings

30:40.467 --> 30:42.130
fuck!

30:42.914 --> 30:43.927
Fuck!

31:03.614 --> 31:05.545
You told me to.

31:05.546 --> 31:10.226
This is not what I meant,
and you know it.

31:13.477 --> 31:14.900
You've planned this.

31:19.075 --> 31:21.944
I know about project skull-fuck.

31:25.920 --> 31:28.675
I planned it and planned it.

31:29.834 --> 31:30.897
Wished for it.

31:30.898 --> 31:31.877
Dreamed about it.

31:31.878 --> 31:33.723
Kill them all.

31:37.131 --> 31:39.066
It's the only way to stop them.

31:40.342 --> 31:41.310
But...

31:43.952 --> 31:44.862
I didn't.

31:50.168 --> 31:51.625
Scare tactics.

31:58.869 --> 32:01.066
Drop the gun, motherfucker!

32:03.615 --> 32:05.271
What are you doing with that?.

32:05.272 --> 32:06.240
What are you doing with that?.
Emergency.

32:06.241 --> 32:08.037
Does it look like one?

32:10.085 --> 32:11.394
Put it away.

32:13.834 --> 32:16.547
Will I have to go away now?

32:16.548 --> 32:18.268
You're not going anywhere.

32:18.829 --> 32:19.785
He is.

32:23.468 --> 32:24.401
Are you serious?

32:24.402 --> 32:28.751
Are you serious?
Er, hang on, jackson, I watched
micky squat over your face while

32:28.752 --> 32:32.136
you drank beer poured down his arse
crack for a dare at frank's stag.

32:32.137 --> 32:34.339
I thought you'd be all
right with this.

32:34.340 --> 32:38.700
Firstly, I didn't, and if I had,
what happens on stag stays on stag.

32:38.701 --> 32:41.335
Secondly,
I don't respond well to threats.

32:41.336 --> 32:46.558
That kid was tormented
day in, day out.

32:46.559 --> 32:49.983
Failed by the school,
by the likes of you.

32:49.984 --> 32:50.997
He was driven to it.

32:50.998 --> 32:52.635
I can't risk my career.

32:52.636 --> 32:56.476
I can't risk my career.
What if today jude hadn't gone
trigger happy with a paint-ball gun

32:56.477 --> 32:58.264
and decided to do
summat else instead,

32:58.265 --> 33:01.798
I dunno, summat much worse,
like hang himself in his wardrobe.

33:04.011 --> 33:06.987
Let gabriel fuck up jude's life
and walk out of here scot free,

33:06.988 --> 33:10.643
then I've... we've failed.

33:11.972 --> 33:15.275
Let go, let go of me! Let go!

33:15.276 --> 33:16.712
Let go!

33:16.713 --> 33:19.222
Let go of me!

33:19.223 --> 33:21.253
Let me go!

33:21.254 --> 33:25.176
Let me out, let me out!
I haven't done anything!

33:25.177 --> 33:26.953
It was him! Let me out!

33:32.177 --> 33:34.729
How will we know
the counselling's working

33:34.730 --> 33:37.764
when the only time we see
each other is in that room?

33:39.240 --> 33:42.196
I want connor home.

33:43.852 --> 33:47.194
I want you both home.

33:47.195 --> 33:48.692
Are we ready?

33:48.693 --> 33:50.988
Probably not.

33:50.989 --> 33:53.782
But we need to be together
and take that risk

33:53.783 --> 33:56.680
sooner or later if...
We're serious about us.

33:56.681 --> 33:59.796
I am.

34:01.799 --> 34:04.127
But what about the rest
of the family?

34:04.128 --> 34:07.316
I run things now.
And I'm making sure we've got

34:07.317 --> 34:10.455
the security we need for our son.

34:11.217 --> 34:13.081
You look smart.

34:14.177 --> 34:15.382
Going anywhere special?

34:15.382 --> 34:18.324
Going anywhere special?
Business.

34:19.821 --> 34:22.797
Think about what I said.

34:31.534 --> 34:33.967
Because of your heroics,
the phone's been ringing

34:33.967 --> 34:36.543
off the hook. Schools from
all over want to contract

34:36.543 --> 34:38.820
the best security firm
in the north west.

34:38.821 --> 34:41.609
This is getting a bit big for us.

34:41.610 --> 34:43.154
We'll be selective.

34:43.155 --> 34:45.324
Jamie wants in.

34:45.326 --> 34:49.178
You're both invited
to a very special dinner tonight.

34:49.179 --> 34:51.759
I've got something
very important to announce.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.690
The cheeky prick.
Jamie can fuck off!

34:59.691 --> 35:01.975
I told him, no!

35:03.760 --> 35:05.860
This is ours.

35:05.861 --> 35:10.351
Look, I'll get this lot off
to the bank, you make some calls,
get the ball rolling.

35:11.920 --> 35:14.986
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
There must be a mistake.

35:14.987 --> 35:18.043
I'm calling on behalf
of maguire security,

35:18.044 --> 35:20.397
your school made an enquiry about...

35:22.794 --> 35:24.947
They're mine and kelly's future.

35:24.948 --> 35:26.084
And we'd like 'em back.

35:26.085 --> 35:28.207
You're using the maguire name,
we're entitled to a piece of it.

35:28.208 --> 35:32.009
So now it's all our futures.
Don't take it personal.

35:32.976 --> 35:36.938
You made it personal
when you went behind my back.

35:36.939 --> 35:38.212
Things have changed.

35:38.213 --> 35:41.337
We either work together
or we don't work at all.

35:41.338 --> 35:43.647
I underestimated you,
I hold my hands up.

35:43.648 --> 35:47.424
Don't let pride get in the way of
the family benefiting from
something you started.

35:47.425 --> 35:49.706
The business isn't me. It's us.

35:49.707 --> 35:52.294
I want the contracts back.

35:52.295 --> 35:54.011
I'm not giving them back.

35:54.012 --> 35:56.217
I didn't expect you to.

35:58.367 --> 36:01.755
Winner gets to keep the contract.

36:01.756 --> 36:02.631
You taking the piss?

36:02.632 --> 36:04.549
S'only fight club, jamie.

36:04.550 --> 36:07.548
Nothing personal.

36:07.549 --> 36:10.449
We do this and I win,

36:10.450 --> 36:14.006
I keep the contracts and I get
a cut of whatever else you make

36:14.007 --> 36:16.951
out of the business from now on.

36:31.370 --> 36:34.712
Chicken curry in a can?
Dirty bastards.

36:34.713 --> 36:37.601
Forty cigs, please, love.

36:37.602 --> 36:40.626
A word?

36:43.375 --> 36:48.036
I had a dream.
About us. Fucking.

36:51.506 --> 36:52.767
Thought I was turning funny.

36:52.768 --> 36:55.488
Thought I was turning funny.
Tempted to drink
from the furry chalice?

36:55.489 --> 36:58.274
I run a lesbian aversion at mine
if you're interested.

37:01.950 --> 37:04.702
Dirty twat!

37:04.703 --> 37:07.384
He was sniffing your arse, lillian!

37:07.385 --> 37:10.341
I know. And he's paying
good money for the privilege.

37:13.018 --> 37:16.233
I know you're not a dyke,
and neither am I.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.972
A misunderstanding, that's all.

37:17.973 --> 37:20.489
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

37:20.490 --> 37:21.058
Fuck right off!

37:21.059 --> 37:23.699
Fuck right off!
A friend who's a girl.

37:26.950 --> 37:28.870
I've never had a friend.

37:30.568 --> 37:33.329
Only family.

37:34.649 --> 37:39.548
Tell you what, pay for me cigs
and we'll forget all about it.

37:40.722 --> 37:43.734
You still... a friend in need
is a friend indeed.

37:43.735 --> 37:46.319
But a friend with weed
is better, and you've got plenty.

37:46.320 --> 37:49.855
So this bitch is a friend for life.

38:07.559 --> 38:09.957
I want to tell you all something.

38:10.503 --> 38:12.819
Just know that I'll always love you.

38:12.820 --> 38:14.604
I'm gay.

38:17.940 --> 38:21.380
Whoa!
Hey, look, I was only joking.

38:21.381 --> 38:25.144
Hey, I'm not really! Got ya!

38:26.792 --> 38:29.209
You are awful.

38:29.210 --> 38:32.238
Kitchen's looking fab, mum.

38:32.239 --> 38:33.636
(She sniffs)

38:35.256 --> 38:37.115
You're a grown woman.

38:37.116 --> 38:40.178
A grown woman who isn't capable
of taking herself to the toilet.

38:40.179 --> 38:44.605
Well, you're in for a shock if you
think I'm gonna wipe your arse.

38:44.606 --> 38:46.206
What's happened to my libby?

38:46.207 --> 38:49.616
I let you put me down, mould me
into the person you wanted.

38:49.617 --> 38:54.585
And then frank came along.
With him I thought I was finally me.

38:55.333 --> 38:59.105
But your venom of control and
manipulation had poisoned my veins

38:59.106 --> 39:03.648
because, just like you thought
you could change me, I thought
I could change him.

39:03.649 --> 39:06.022
I don't blame him for running.

39:06.023 --> 39:07.535
I should've run myself,
a long time ago.

39:07.536 --> 39:11.418
I should've run myself,
a long time ago.
Shove the hippy crap up your hole.

39:11.419 --> 39:13.309
Whatever happened to my mother?.

39:13.310 --> 39:14.712
Let go.

39:14.713 --> 39:16.508
Let go.
I wanted a better life for you.

39:16.509 --> 39:17.789
Let...Go.

39:17.790 --> 39:20.833
Let...Go.
I didn't want you making
the same mistakes I made.

39:20.834 --> 39:23.416
Stop lying.

39:23.417 --> 39:24.614
Your youth.

39:24.615 --> 39:25.885
Looks.

39:25.886 --> 39:26.874
Optimism.

39:26.875 --> 39:27.934
Ambition.

39:27.935 --> 39:30.545
I never had any of that.

39:30.546 --> 39:33.104
That's why I didn't let you.

39:58.319 --> 40:01.262
I'll take the good with the bad.

40:02.273 --> 40:04.671
How about you?

40:09.511 --> 40:12.923
The old libby hasn't
completely gone,

40:12.924 --> 40:15.617
there's still lots I love.

40:15.618 --> 40:18.616
But she could never have done this.

40:18.617 --> 40:20.517
Every nook and cranny, boys.

40:20.518 --> 40:23.985
There's a nice little
bonus in it for you.

40:32.726 --> 40:35.056
Someone tell me
what the hell's gone on.

40:35.057 --> 40:37.817
Someone tell me
what the hell's gone on.
Not allowed to talk about it.

40:37.818 --> 40:39.804
It's the first rule.

40:39.805 --> 40:41.968
Are you two fuckin' cracked?

40:41.969 --> 40:44.252
Micky's got more sense.

40:44.253 --> 40:47.492
Dinner, fuck!
You two get cleaned up now.

40:52.418 --> 40:53.714
We ok?

41:05.732 --> 41:07.516
Put these away in the safe
will you, mam.

41:07.517 --> 41:09.748
Put these away in the safe
will you, mam.
What?.

41:09.749 --> 41:11.883
New business contracts
for the family.

41:11.884 --> 41:13.581
How's things going with karen?

41:13.582 --> 41:17.754
I've said all I need to say.
Ball's in her court now.

41:23.493 --> 41:24.823
Sorted.

41:41.536 --> 41:42.862
Sorry we're late.

41:42.863 --> 41:45.524
You're not just late.

41:45.525 --> 41:48.303
You're not even fashionable late.

41:48.304 --> 41:51.254
You're two fuckin' hours late.

41:51.255 --> 41:54.915
I bend over backwards,
sidewards, anything for you lot.

41:56.296 --> 41:58.440
But I ask you to do
one little thing for me.

41:58.441 --> 42:01.507
Had special invitations,
hand delivered and everything.

42:01.508 --> 42:07.282
But you blew me out, cos you're
all too wrapped up in your own shit.

42:07.412 --> 42:08.070
Get a grip!

42:08.071 --> 42:09.841
We're here now.

42:09.842 --> 42:12.058
Tell us.

42:17.048 --> 42:18.082
No.

42:18.083 --> 42:19.333
Oh, for fuck's sake, micky,
what's all this about?.

42:19.334 --> 42:20.305
Oh, for fuck's sake, micky,
what's all this about?.
Oh, grow up!

42:19.328 --> 42:21.260
Oh, for fuck's sake, micky,
what's all this about?.
Oh, grow up!
No!

42:21.261 --> 42:23.280
You don't deserve to know.

42:23.281 --> 42:26.996
You're not ready for me.

42:26.997 --> 42:30.327
You might never be.

42:31.922 --> 42:35.411
Why's everybody talking
in fucking riddles today?

42:36.890 --> 42:38.685
This is your fault.

42:42.280 --> 42:44.508
Why's this carrot
shaped like a knob?

42:46.766 --> 42:49.074
Bye now.

42:52.699 --> 42:56.650
A stronger heart for our home,
and a better life for all of us now.

42:56.651 --> 42:58.333
Wedding money well spent,
eh, mother?.

42:58.334 --> 43:01.258
A new kitchen or a life
with frank gallagher?.

43:02.824 --> 43:04.472
No contest.

43:09.199 --> 43:11.862
Come and see our
fabulous new kitchen.

43:11.863 --> 43:13.875
We'll be down in a bit.

43:15.161 --> 43:16.332
What are you watching?

43:16.333 --> 43:18.486
What are you watching?
Nothing. Porn.

43:20.088 --> 43:21.127
Move.

43:21.128 --> 43:21.423
Don't.

43:21.424 --> 43:23.560
Don't.
Move!

43:26.721 --> 43:30.101
'Disillusionment
is all over the place.

43:30.102 --> 43:34.119
'I mean, who really creates those
opportunities that you wait for?.

43:34.120 --> 43:36.850
'It's not teachers,
not aliens, not gods.

43:36.851 --> 43:37.958
'You do.

43:37.959 --> 43:41.788
'And that's fine,
as long as you know this -

43:41.789 --> 43:46.156
'there will always be some cunt
to stand in your way.

43:46.157 --> 43:50.317
'And sometimes, you just can't win.'

43:50.318 --> 43:54.821
I will kill you!
I'll fuckin' kill you!

43:54.822 --> 43:56.970
Frank!

43:59.932 --> 44:00.681
Libby?

44:00.682 --> 44:03.217
Libby?
You're awake.

44:04.370 --> 44:06.233
Monica?

44:07.625 --> 44:10.672
I didn't want you to miss the birth.

44:13.936 --> 44:16.067
I get woozy just looking at oysters,

44:16.068 --> 44:18.790
why the fuck would I want
to watch you give birth?

44:18.791 --> 44:21.361
Oh, not me, frank.

44:21.362 --> 44:22.764
You.

44:22.765 --> 44:24.247
How can I be preg...?

44:24.248 --> 44:26.339
Gut rumbles

44:31.747 --> 44:34.417
oh, it's a little boy!

44:34.418 --> 44:36.828
Baby mick hucknall.

44:38.867 --> 44:40.285
Libby?! Libby!

44:40.286 --> 44:41.388
Shit he's off again.

44:40.286 --> 44:43.091
Shit he's off again.
Sit on his face! Libby!

44:43.092 --> 44:45.993
I'll sit on his face!
Libby!

44:45.994 --> 44:47.962
So, who is this frank gallagher?.

44:47.963 --> 44:49.872
It's a product of his schizophrenia,
doctor.

44:49.873 --> 44:54.755
He'll only respond when we refer
to him by his 'frank' identity.

44:54.756 --> 44:57.647
The details he's created
are incredibly sophisticated.

44:57.648 --> 45:00.424
Lives on a 'chatsworth estate'
with his two children,

45:00.425 --> 45:03.282
engaged to be married to
a fictitious librarian called libby.

45:03.283 --> 45:08.617
He's made several attempts
to leave here for this fantasy life.

45:08.618 --> 45:10.971
As a result, we've had to keep him
sedated for his own safety.

45:10.972 --> 45:14.284
Is there a history
of trauma or stress?

45:14.285 --> 45:16.333
Anything that may have
triggered his condition?

45:16.334 --> 45:18.368
According to his partner,
he hasn't been the same

45:18.369 --> 45:20.960
since the con-dem coalition.

45:20.961 --> 45:25.342
I would think we'd need to keep him
in for at least another week.

45:25.343 --> 45:28.483
I'm afraid he'll
be here indefinitely.

45:28.484 --> 45:30.632
It's for the best.

45:31.959 --> 45:34.266
I'll inform his family.

45:38.835 --> 45:40.169
Remember me?

45:40.170 --> 45:42.496
I fucking hate you
for what you did to him.

45:42.497 --> 45:43.870
I failed.

45:43.871 --> 45:47.262
I'd like for you
and I to have sex, sita.

45:47.263 --> 45:51.156
He's offered me a way ahead.

45:51.157 --> 45:52.180
Karen, no.

45:52.181 --> 45:54.746
I'm going in as an out-patient,
I'm gonna get my meds assessed.

45:54.747 --> 45:56.406
Have you been here this whole time?

45:56.407 --> 45:57.843
I'm not sure.

45:57.923 --> 46:00.742
D'you know, you'd suit
a brazilian, Barry.
