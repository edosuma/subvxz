00:16.800 --> 00:18.520
You should prepare yourself.

00:18.520 --> 00:19.840
Where is it?

00:19.840 --> 00:21.880
I told him what to expect...

00:21.880 --> 00:23.560
Just show me.

00:56.920 --> 00:58.440
Bloody hell, Ruth!

00:58.440 --> 00:59.800
This is going to take ages!

00:59.800 --> 01:01.400
I told your boss it was a bad one.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.040
It's 3.00! I'm supposed to be...

01:03.040 --> 01:05.360
Curry night. I told them,
"He won't like this.

01:05.360 --> 01:07.320
"It's curry night
at the White Horse."

01:07.320 --> 01:08.360
It's on everything!

01:08.360 --> 01:11.440
Look, it's on curtains,
bloody clock!

01:11.440 --> 01:13.520
Who puts a white rug
in a kitchen?

01:13.520 --> 01:15.880
Did Siegfried move here
after Roy died?

01:17.040 --> 01:19.960
Jesus! What happened?
A woman killed her husband.

01:19.960 --> 01:21.600
What with, a combine harvester?

01:21.600 --> 01:24.360
Stabbed him 38 times. Why?

01:24.360 --> 01:25.840
To piss me off?

01:25.840 --> 01:27.400
You only need five stabs.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.000
Anything else is showboating.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.080
Oh, you'll be all right,
you've got ages!

01:31.080 --> 01:32.560
I'm a cleaner.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.560
I'm not Jesus.

01:34.560 --> 01:37.960
The naans come out at 7.00,
and they go stale very quickly.

01:37.960 --> 01:40.040
I need to be sat down
by 6.30 at the latest.

01:40.040 --> 01:41.680
Well, there you go, three hours.

01:41.680 --> 01:42.840
And I'm up there later.

01:42.840 --> 01:45.040
I'll get Mervin
to keep you a jalfrezi.

01:45.040 --> 01:47.680
Do you think this is
a three-hour job?

01:47.680 --> 01:48.720
I've not looked yet,

01:48.720 --> 01:51.040
but I'd be willing to bet
there's blood on the ceiling.

01:51.040 --> 01:53.240
Yep! Hello! Oh, and also...

01:53.240 --> 01:54.840
..the models need doing.

01:54.840 --> 01:58.520
They were his pride and joy,
apparently. Why? He's dead!

01:58.520 --> 02:00.880
Who's going to care?
His wife who murdered him?

02:00.880 --> 02:02.600
Or am I being thorough for a ghost?

02:02.600 --> 02:06.480
You're just grumpy cos you're on
a promise from the tattooed milf.

02:06.480 --> 02:07.800
No, I'm not.

02:07.800 --> 02:10.640
She'll be waiting for you,
no matter how late you get there.

02:10.640 --> 02:13.520
I'm not seeing her any more.
Aw. Why not?

02:13.520 --> 02:15.720
I think it was cos I realised
that everybody calls her

02:15.720 --> 02:17.800
"the tattooed milf" -
even her own mother.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.800
She doesn't even have
that many tattoos.

02:19.800 --> 02:22.760
You haven't seen her back, mate.
It's all anchors and sea monsters.

02:22.760 --> 02:25.920
It's like shagging
a treasure map. Ohh, God!

02:25.920 --> 02:27.560
She's even got it on the pot plants!

02:27.560 --> 02:29.680
Oh, well, good luck, Mr Mop.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.680
See you later...hopefully.

02:32.800 --> 02:34.640
All right.

02:34.640 --> 02:36.280
Right, Wicky.

02:36.280 --> 02:37.640
Think curry.

02:37.640 --> 02:39.800
Just think delicious curry.

03:43.120 --> 03:44.760
Hello. Argh!

03:46.680 --> 03:48.480
Hey!

03:49.520 --> 03:50.720
How are you feeling?

03:51.880 --> 03:55.040
Yeah, I'm a little shaken,
but I'll live.

03:55.040 --> 03:57.320
Honestly, you're just like my boy,

03:57.320 --> 04:00.080
running around, causing chaos.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.200
To be honest with you,

04:01.200 --> 04:03.440
I was pretty pleased
that I kicked that high.

04:03.440 --> 04:05.960
Ah! You boys and your karate!

04:05.960 --> 04:07.760
Ah...

04:07.760 --> 04:10.320
Well, I'd better get on.

04:17.440 --> 04:19.760
Yes, dear.
I'm just waiting for my letter.

04:20.840 --> 04:22.240
Your...?

04:22.240 --> 04:24.040
Well, as I say to my boy,

04:24.040 --> 04:26.200
what's an apology without a letter?

04:26.200 --> 04:28.920
It's like a burp in the wind, huh?

04:28.920 --> 04:31.040
You want me to write you
an apology letter?

04:31.040 --> 04:34.000
The pie didn't kick itself out
of my hands now, did it, dear?

04:35.520 --> 04:36.880
Why not?

04:36.880 --> 04:40.240
Well, it came as no surprise to me
that Mrs Bellingham did this.

04:40.240 --> 04:42.680
Never trust a woman
who doesn't bake.

04:42.680 --> 04:45.440
I used to bring a pie
round every Tuesday

04:45.440 --> 04:46.880
for poor Mr Bellingham.

04:46.880 --> 04:48.480
And now, look.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.760
Not all women bake, though,
do they?

04:50.760 --> 04:52.640
All women of my generation do.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.240
It was drummed into us -

04:54.240 --> 04:57.400
and if she's not baking,
what is she doing?

04:57.400 --> 04:59.040
I guess she's into other things.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.000
Exactly what Myra Hindley said.

05:04.160 --> 05:06.840
So...you must be a policeman.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.160
How exciting.

05:08.160 --> 05:09.680
No, I'm here to clean up, so...

05:09.680 --> 05:11.560
You're a cleaner?
What did I tell you?

05:11.560 --> 05:13.400
The world is upside down!

05:13.400 --> 05:14.800
Crime scene cleaner.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.760
It needs a woman's touch.

05:16.760 --> 05:19.720
Now, get me a mop, and I'll do it.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.840
Name a stain! Pardon?

05:21.840 --> 05:24.240
Name a stain
that's impossible to get out.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.640
Beetroot on linen.

05:25.640 --> 05:26.880
Pectinase. What?

05:26.880 --> 05:30.640
It's an enzyme which breaks down
pectin, a polysaccharide

05:30.640 --> 05:32.440
found in plant cell walls.

05:32.440 --> 05:35.240
Used in conjunction
with hydrogen peroxide

05:35.240 --> 05:36.840
and a microfibre brush,

05:36.840 --> 05:39.640
I can get beetroot out of anything.

05:39.640 --> 05:40.920
And you know why?

05:40.920 --> 05:44.760
Because I am a qualified
crime scene cleaner.

05:44.760 --> 05:48.200
I can get dried blood out
of a white woollen carpet.

05:48.200 --> 05:51.040
I can remove skull fragments
from velvet. Ew!

05:51.040 --> 05:53.640
So...think on!

05:58.960 --> 06:00.640
Yeah. Firm, but fair.

06:11.880 --> 06:13.200
Hello.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.320
Hey!

06:14.320 --> 06:16.920
Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.

06:16.920 --> 06:18.240
I let myself in.

06:18.240 --> 06:20.800
Has everyone got keys
to this bloody house?

06:20.800 --> 06:22.000
Oh, gosh. I hope not.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.960
Erm, just me and our neighbour now,
I think. It's all right.

06:24.960 --> 06:27.320
At least you weren't
carrying a pie, I suppose.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.240
Oh, no. I don't bake.

06:29.240 --> 06:32.920
No. It was a source of some...
irritation for my husband.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.360
Oh.

06:34.360 --> 06:36.080
You're the, erm...?

06:36.080 --> 06:37.880
Oh, this is...?

06:37.880 --> 06:39.840
I'm the wife, yes.

06:39.840 --> 06:42.040
Oh, I suppose I should
say "widow" now.

06:42.040 --> 06:46.040
Yes, I suppose you should!

06:46.040 --> 06:48.000
I was just, erm...

06:48.000 --> 06:51.080
I was just going to go
and get some...murder.

06:51.080 --> 06:53.200
Some...? Some murder for the stab.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.960
What am I talking about?

06:54.960 --> 06:57.520
I was just going to go and fill
my bucket with blood.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.080
For the murder stab.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.400
Water!

07:00.400 --> 07:03.680
Water to clean the stab a man
murder walls of all the blood!

07:03.680 --> 07:05.080
Water!

07:05.080 --> 07:07.600
Water for my bucket!

07:07.600 --> 07:09.840
So, I'll go and do that,

07:09.840 --> 07:13.880
and then, maybe you and I could have
a nice cup of tea, couldn't we?

07:14.920 --> 07:17.240
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to ask you to stay.

07:18.920 --> 07:20.600
If you don't mind awfully.

07:21.720 --> 07:23.000
I would be delighted.

07:32.040 --> 07:33.880
In the cupboard, please.

07:33.880 --> 07:36.080
Oh... In the cupboard.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.680
No, I can't. I'm sorry.
I'm claustrophobic.

07:38.680 --> 07:40.920
And I can see they've got
wool coats in there,

07:40.920 --> 07:41.960
and I'm allergic.

07:41.960 --> 07:44.680
It makes my throat go up like
a puffer fish. Seriously.

07:44.680 --> 07:46.280
Cupboard.

07:46.280 --> 07:48.000
Look, how long are you going to be?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.560
Just collecting some things,
then I'll be on my way.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.000
So, like, ten minutes?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.480
Or are you going to lock me in,

07:53.480 --> 07:55.360
and then wait for me
to be discovered?

07:55.360 --> 07:57.720
Sorry, have you got somewhere
you've got to be?

07:59.240 --> 08:01.000
Well, yeah.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.800
You're being held at gunpoint
by a woman who you know has,

08:04.800 --> 08:06.080
within the past 48 hours,

08:06.080 --> 08:08.600
used her husband as a knife block.

08:08.600 --> 08:12.200
So, do weigh up your answer
to this really carefully.

08:12.200 --> 08:15.040
What is so...important?

08:16.840 --> 08:19.760
Well, it's nothing.
I was just...

08:19.760 --> 08:22.200
I was just going to go
to the White Horse.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.120
A pub? It's curry night.

08:24.120 --> 08:26.640
It's curry night? Yeah. It's £5.

08:26.640 --> 08:30.320
And, honestly, considering it's all
cooked by a white guy called Mervin,

08:30.320 --> 08:31.360
it is delicious.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.680
What, it's worth being shot for?

08:33.680 --> 08:35.200
You should come!

08:35.200 --> 08:36.840
It's as many naans as you can eat.

08:36.840 --> 08:38.240
That's a mistake by Mervin.

08:38.240 --> 08:40.840
I had nine last week
before the madras came out.

08:40.840 --> 08:43.880
OK. So, you're refusing to get in
because of Mervin's naans?

08:43.880 --> 08:46.400
Let's get this over with.
Hey, hey, hey, no!

08:46.400 --> 08:48.760
I'll get in. I'll get in.
Lovely. It'll be nice.

08:57.600 --> 09:01.200
You couldn't ring ahead,
then, could you?

09:01.200 --> 09:04.080
And ask them if they'll put
some on one side for me?

09:04.080 --> 09:06.280
If you look on Google,
it's the White Horse.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.920
Don't go on the website,

09:07.920 --> 09:09.520
because Mervin messed that up.

09:09.520 --> 09:11.960
The link just takes you
to an abattoir.

09:11.960 --> 09:13.240
In Poland.

09:13.240 --> 09:14.800
I think it's Poland.

09:14.800 --> 09:16.760
Either way, the cows look weird.

09:16.760 --> 09:17.800
Hello?!

09:17.800 --> 09:18.960
Oh, my God.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.640
How dull must your life be?

09:23.640 --> 09:25.040
Come with me.

09:33.560 --> 09:34.720
Sit.

09:38.240 --> 09:40.920
This church has a little surprise.

09:40.920 --> 09:42.320
Smoke?

09:42.320 --> 09:43.600
Yeah.

09:55.640 --> 09:56.960
Ah...

10:01.000 --> 10:03.800
First time I've ever
done this in here.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.720
He didn't approve of smoking.

10:05.720 --> 10:07.320
No, of course he didn't.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.880
That's why I liked hiding them
in his precious little models.

10:11.880 --> 10:15.080
That was a minor act of rebellion.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.120
Oh, don't worry.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.080
I'll, erm... I'll open the windows.

10:20.080 --> 10:21.480
Oh, it's not that.

10:21.480 --> 10:23.960
It's, erm...it's all the...

10:23.960 --> 10:25.840
Hm? Oh, yes.

10:25.840 --> 10:27.360
I do need to change.

10:27.360 --> 10:31.280
Don't worry.
I've no intention of hurting you.

10:31.280 --> 10:34.120
Mind you, I had no intention
of hurting my husband.

10:34.120 --> 10:36.400
It's funny. I, erm...

10:36.400 --> 10:39.040
I really don't remember
what happened.

10:39.040 --> 10:42.120
You stabbed him. 38 times.

10:42.120 --> 10:43.520
Goodness me!

10:43.520 --> 10:45.400
I was cross, wasn't I? Yes.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.960
Five would've been plenty. Hm.

10:47.960 --> 10:50.160
I mean...do you mind me asking?

10:50.160 --> 10:51.720
Hm?

10:51.720 --> 10:53.840
What did he do wrong?

10:53.840 --> 10:55.520
He made models.

10:55.520 --> 10:57.640
No. No, I mean,
why did you kill him?

10:57.640 --> 10:59.880
I know what you meant,
and my answer remains.

11:02.320 --> 11:03.760
I don't understand.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.720
Have you ever had a paper cut?

11:05.720 --> 11:07.480
I don't think I ever have.

11:07.480 --> 11:09.880
But do you know what?
There was a kid I went to school

11:09.880 --> 11:12.240
with who used to give them
to himself on purpose.

11:12.240 --> 11:14.360
A cry for help?
Oh, no. He was just a nutter.

11:14.360 --> 11:17.120
Last time I saw him, he was
riding round town on a dog.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.360
A paper cut is, erm...

11:19.360 --> 11:21.120
It's small.

11:21.120 --> 11:23.200
It isn't life-threatening.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.760
But it really hurts.

11:25.760 --> 11:27.800
It bleeds for a really long time.

11:28.960 --> 11:31.280
And that's what my marriage
was like.

11:31.280 --> 11:34.600
A tiny paper cut...
after tiny paper cut.

11:34.600 --> 11:38.760
Until one day...
well, I decided I'd bled enough.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.320
It was his turn.

11:40.320 --> 11:45.800
I believe the final straw
was the reordering of the fridge.

11:45.800 --> 11:50.400
Eh? Yeah. All of the bottles
rearranged in height order.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.760
It sounds silly, doesn't it?

11:52.760 --> 11:55.080
But I opened the door

11:55.080 --> 11:56.680
and, suddenly, I thought,

11:56.680 --> 12:00.480
"I do not want the juice
at the top and the Yakult

12:00.480 --> 12:02.200
"at the bottom, and..."

12:04.800 --> 12:05.840
Well...

12:05.840 --> 12:07.200
I know what you mean.

12:07.200 --> 12:10.000
My ex, once, she put all the DVDs
in alphabetical order,

12:10.000 --> 12:11.520
and I ran her over with the van.

12:11.520 --> 12:13.480
Did you? No!

12:13.480 --> 12:15.360
Because I'm not a psychopath.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.360
I'm not a psychopath.

12:17.360 --> 12:19.560
I'm the treasurer of
the community centre.

12:19.560 --> 12:22.320
Oh, right. Well, as long as
the coffee morning receipts

12:22.320 --> 12:25.080
are in order, who's going to
begrudge you a little bloodbath?

12:25.080 --> 12:27.400
I see.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.440
Upstairs.

12:28.440 --> 12:30.520
I'm not going in the cupboard.
Upstairs!

12:36.240 --> 12:37.640
Right, get in the bathroom.

12:37.640 --> 12:40.040
Was that always an option?

12:40.040 --> 12:42.880
Why did we have to go through
all that cupboard pantomime?

12:42.880 --> 12:45.440
Please, don't be fooled by
my charming demeanour.

12:45.440 --> 12:47.680
I'm on the edge.
I have little time. Get in.

13:08.640 --> 13:09.960
Fucking sausages!

13:11.640 --> 13:12.680
Hey!

13:12.680 --> 13:14.120
Psst!

13:14.120 --> 13:16.000
Hey, kid!

13:16.000 --> 13:17.320
Psst!

13:17.320 --> 13:18.920
Mama said I'm not to talk to you.

13:18.920 --> 13:20.560
What? Why?

13:20.560 --> 13:24.040
Because you go around kicking pies
out of people's hands.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.640
Kid, I need your help here!

13:31.160 --> 13:33.600
Oh, my God.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.680
You got a problem? No, no problem!

13:36.680 --> 13:38.960
Listen. Lend me your phone.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.360
I haven't got a phone.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.680
I don't want square eyes,
thank you very much.

13:42.680 --> 13:45.560
Can you go and ask your mum
if she'll...? Erm...

13:45.560 --> 13:48.080
Mum's not going to want to help you,
Mr Pie-Kicker.

13:48.080 --> 13:50.160
That's what I wanted
to talk to her about.

13:50.160 --> 13:53.080
Because of my silly behaviour,
I didn't get to taste her pie.

13:53.080 --> 13:55.600
Delicious pies.
Yeah, yeah, delicious pie!

13:55.600 --> 13:59.120
So, I was wondering if she'd
give me a second chance...

13:59.120 --> 14:00.760
..and bring me another pie?

14:00.760 --> 14:03.320
You'd have to write her a sorry
letter. She's had a letter!

14:03.320 --> 14:05.200
Mum! Oh, hey, hey, hey!

14:11.680 --> 14:13.400
This is all there is.

14:28.280 --> 14:30.000
This is the best I can do.

14:57.160 --> 14:58.360
All done?

14:58.360 --> 14:59.400
Yeah. Nearly.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.280
Erm... I need to use the bathroom.

15:01.280 --> 15:03.200
Oh, yeah. Of course.

15:03.200 --> 15:04.480
Where are you going?

15:06.040 --> 15:07.560
You said you needed to use...
I do.

15:07.560 --> 15:09.360
You're going to have to
stay in here.

15:09.360 --> 15:11.160
Of course.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.720
Of course you're going to
make me watch you have a wee.

15:13.720 --> 15:15.080
Turn around.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.560
It's not a wee I need,
I'm afraid.

15:18.560 --> 15:19.880
What?

15:19.880 --> 15:21.600
No, you can't!

15:21.600 --> 15:23.040
Not while I'm in here.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.720
What, are you under the impression
that women don't?

15:25.720 --> 15:27.680
No, I'm perfectly aware
that women do.

15:27.680 --> 15:30.200
I just don't want to be in
the room when it...comes out.

15:30.200 --> 15:31.240
Well, tough.

15:31.240 --> 15:33.720
I have been dancing to
the tune of man for 35 years.

15:33.720 --> 15:36.720
If I need to defecate, you can just
damn well stand there and listen.

15:36.720 --> 15:38.480
Oh, yeah. Good. Good. You carry on.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.560
Cos this is important, isn't it?

15:40.560 --> 15:42.880
This is like when you won the vote.
Go on!

15:42.880 --> 15:44.320
Poo your way into history.

15:46.360 --> 15:47.960
Oh, for God's sake!

15:47.960 --> 15:50.600
Be quiet! Me be quiet?!

15:58.680 --> 16:00.880
Have you considered
this might just be gas?

16:00.880 --> 16:02.000
No, I'm constipated.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.720
It's hardly surprising -
I've been eating corned beef

16:04.720 --> 16:06.120
in the woods for two nights.

16:06.120 --> 16:07.480
That's what it is!

16:08.920 --> 16:10.240
Oh, it's no good.

16:10.240 --> 16:12.360
It's not going to come
while you're in here.

16:12.360 --> 16:13.880
Well, let me go outside, then.

16:13.880 --> 16:15.760
I won't run away, I promise.
You will.

16:15.760 --> 16:18.960
OK, I will run away! But come on!

16:18.960 --> 16:21.840
All right. Stand outside. Go slowly.

16:21.840 --> 16:24.040
But the moment you're outside,
you start talking.

16:24.040 --> 16:27.080
If you stop talking for a second,
I'll start shooting. Fine!

16:29.240 --> 16:30.920
Talk!

16:30.920 --> 16:31.960
What about?

16:31.960 --> 16:33.680
I don't know. Anything.

16:33.680 --> 16:35.280
All right.

16:35.280 --> 16:37.320
There'll be three types
of curry tonight.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.000
There'll be a madras,
and a jalfrezi...

16:39.000 --> 16:41.280
No, not about your curry.
I'm bored of your curry.

16:41.280 --> 16:43.120
God, your world's so fucking small!

16:44.320 --> 16:46.080
I can't think!

16:46.080 --> 16:47.920
Why not? I don't know.

16:47.920 --> 16:50.400
I suppose it's because
I'm being held at gunpoint

16:50.400 --> 16:52.120
by a murderer who's having a shit!

16:52.120 --> 16:54.280
Sing, then. Sing what?

16:54.280 --> 16:56.320
I don't know! It doesn't matter!

16:58.840 --> 16:59.880

to have to get back in there.

18:43.720 --> 18:45.440
That's fine. It's part of the job.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.960
I'm used to odours. Yeah.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.120
Yeah.

18:56.120 --> 18:57.760
I mean, fair play, that's awful.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.880
Shh! Be quiet!

19:11.560 --> 19:13.120
I told you to shut up.

19:14.840 --> 19:16.080
Oh...piss.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.000
I thought it was weird.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.160
I thought it was weird that you
stabbed him to death when you had

19:21.160 --> 19:22.880
a perfectly good gun in the house.

19:22.880 --> 19:26.160
But this is...
One of his stupid models, yeah.

19:26.160 --> 19:29.560
It's very good. I didn't say
he wasn't good at models.

19:31.240 --> 19:33.040
Hello? Hello there?

19:33.040 --> 19:35.360
I got your apology!

19:35.360 --> 19:37.200
I have a pie!

19:37.200 --> 19:39.160
I don't understand.

19:39.160 --> 19:42.120
If he was that bad for
all those years... No.

19:42.120 --> 19:44.240
..why didn't you just...?
No, I know.

19:44.240 --> 19:46.960
I had a chance of pushing him down
a huge flight of stairs

19:46.960 --> 19:49.320
a few years ago,
but chickened out last minute.

19:49.320 --> 19:52.840
No! I don't mean
why didn't you kill him sooner.

19:52.840 --> 19:55.280
I mean, why didn't you
just leave him?

19:55.280 --> 19:59.160
Hello! I've accepted your apology!

19:59.160 --> 20:02.040
Sunk cost fallacy.

20:02.040 --> 20:05.280
What? It's a term I learned
at business school

20:05.280 --> 20:07.320
when I had my own ambitions...

20:07.320 --> 20:09.520
..and before I gave my life to him.

20:09.520 --> 20:10.840
Well, what does it mean?

20:10.840 --> 20:12.480
Hello?

20:12.480 --> 20:14.680
What does it matter?
It's over now.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.520
Do what you need to do.

20:19.040 --> 20:20.920
Anyway...

20:20.920 --> 20:22.640
..you wouldn't understand.

20:22.640 --> 20:24.560
Hello?

20:34.880 --> 20:36.960
Ahh!

20:42.320 --> 20:44.000
Try me.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.360
Can I show you something?

20:58.560 --> 20:59.760
Where are we going?

20:59.760 --> 21:02.440
Have you ever heard of
the Dolomites? Yes, of course.

21:02.440 --> 21:05.080
It's where the castle is
with the man, isn't it?

21:05.080 --> 21:07.200
Yeah. No, 'course you haven't.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.440
It's a mountain range in Italy.

21:09.440 --> 21:11.840
My grandfather,
he was from the region,

21:11.840 --> 21:13.240
and when I was a little girl,

21:13.240 --> 21:16.200
he used to tell me tales
of their beauty.

21:16.200 --> 21:17.920
Crystal-clear lakes.

21:17.920 --> 21:21.520
Air so pure, you'd feel drunk
with every inhalation.

21:21.520 --> 21:23.520
Erm, around every corner,

21:23.520 --> 21:25.640
a more godlike vista.

21:25.640 --> 21:29.200
Anyway, in the months leading up
to my 50th birthday,

21:29.200 --> 21:30.800
I dropped so many hints -

21:30.800 --> 21:33.760
my longing to go there,
to breathe in that air.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.240
I even took Italian lessons.

21:35.240 --> 21:36.680
And...

21:43.320 --> 21:44.800
Oh, God.

21:47.600 --> 21:50.240
Yeah.

21:58.680 --> 22:00.040
It took him months.

22:00.040 --> 22:01.480
Barely saw him.

22:01.480 --> 22:03.120
He'd creep into bed at night.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.200
The stench of glue will
haunt me for life.

22:05.200 --> 22:06.800
Well, it's sort of sweet.

22:06.800 --> 22:08.800
He remembered you liked
the Dolomites.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.720
What? Well, it shows
he was listening, doesn't it?

22:11.720 --> 22:13.920
Hey, for my mum's
birthday this year,

22:13.920 --> 22:15.440
my dad bought her a telescope.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.000
She's registered blind.

22:18.760 --> 22:20.840
A lifetime following him around

22:20.840 --> 22:24.080
from model convention
to miniature railway.

22:24.080 --> 22:26.880
And the one chance
that he has to make up

22:26.880 --> 22:29.440
for 35 years of disappointment

22:29.440 --> 22:31.800
and take me to the place
of my dreams...

22:31.800 --> 22:33.400
..and he makes me a model of it?!

22:34.840 --> 22:38.080
No! This is all about him.

22:38.080 --> 22:41.600
And, anyway, I want to live life.

22:41.600 --> 22:46.680
I don't want to stare at
a mini polystyrene version of it.

22:46.680 --> 22:48.960
You married a nerd!

22:48.960 --> 22:50.960
Why did you stay with a nerd?

22:50.960 --> 22:53.280
Sunk cost fallacy, I told you.

22:53.280 --> 22:56.120
If you invest a lifetime
into something,

22:56.120 --> 23:00.040
pulling out means
that lifetime meant nothing.

23:00.040 --> 23:02.480
Fine. Why did you have to stab him?

23:02.480 --> 23:04.320
Because I loved him.

23:05.800 --> 23:08.440
OK, you're an absolute nut job.

23:08.440 --> 23:09.880
Maybe.

23:09.880 --> 23:12.280
Well, you're not going
to get away with it.

23:12.280 --> 23:14.360
There'll be pictures
of you everywhere.

23:14.360 --> 23:16.680
Oh, I've no intention of
getting away with it.

23:19.240 --> 23:20.520
Tea?

23:25.400 --> 23:26.440
Oh...

23:26.440 --> 23:27.800
Ah!

23:29.520 --> 23:31.360
I think you should turn yourself in.

23:31.360 --> 23:32.760
Oh, I agree. You do?

23:32.760 --> 23:34.400
Oh, yes. Bourbon?

23:35.840 --> 23:37.960
Yeah.

23:37.960 --> 23:40.920
I mean, I could put a pretty
strong argument together

23:40.920 --> 23:42.640
for why I cracked,

23:42.640 --> 23:45.600
but, no, that's not my intention.

23:45.600 --> 23:48.560
I committed an awful crime...

23:48.560 --> 23:50.960
..and I must pay the price.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.560
Fine. So what's with
all the packing, then?

23:53.560 --> 23:57.680
Are they having pool parties
in prison now? Well...

23:57.680 --> 24:00.800
..since he died, I feel amazing.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.840
I see beauty everywhere.

24:02.840 --> 24:04.640
I feel reborn.

24:04.640 --> 24:06.960
So, no, I must go to prison,

24:06.960 --> 24:10.240
I know I must, but before that...

24:10.240 --> 24:12.360
Well, I had wanted to go there.

24:12.360 --> 24:14.040
To go where?

24:14.040 --> 24:15.320
Dolomites!

24:16.440 --> 24:19.440
I wanted to breathe in that air

24:19.440 --> 24:21.040
and swim in those waters,

24:21.040 --> 24:25.280
and feel for once, just once,
I wanted to feel alive.

24:25.280 --> 24:29.600
In the moment -
no past, no future, just alive.

24:29.600 --> 24:33.680
Just two weeks of pure freedom.

24:33.680 --> 24:37.160
Cold gelato. Dry white wine.

24:37.160 --> 24:41.600
Eating lemons directly off the tree.

24:41.600 --> 24:43.760
Oh...yes.

24:43.760 --> 24:45.360
That does sound good.

24:46.560 --> 24:49.480
Apart from the bit about
eating lemons.

24:49.480 --> 24:51.360
Come with me. What?!

24:51.360 --> 24:53.040
Come with me. Oh, you're...

24:53.040 --> 24:54.560
Crazy. Yeah. I know.

24:54.560 --> 24:56.440
Why would you want me
to come with you?

24:56.440 --> 24:58.880
Oh, don't flatter yourself.
You're not my type.

24:58.880 --> 25:00.840
Your life is going nowhere.

25:00.840 --> 25:03.200
You're a single 50-year-old man,
no children,

25:03.200 --> 25:05.320
with a job you tolerate, at best.

25:05.320 --> 25:07.200
I'm very good at my job!

25:07.200 --> 25:10.320
I'm actually seeing
a tattooed milf, so...

25:10.320 --> 25:11.720
Oh...

25:11.720 --> 25:13.080
Oh, God.

25:13.080 --> 25:17.080
Tell me one thing you've got
to look forward to. Just one.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.280
Me and the lads are going
to see Slack Sabbath.

25:19.280 --> 25:22.400
Black Sabbath?
No, they're like them, but...

25:22.400 --> 25:25.040
..they're fat.

25:25.040 --> 25:26.680
Live.

25:26.680 --> 25:28.640
Live for once.

25:30.440 --> 25:32.040
All right.

25:32.040 --> 25:33.400
I will. Sod it.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.480
Really? Yeah. Why not?

25:35.480 --> 25:37.000
The tattooed milf'll keep.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.880
Oh, my God!

25:38.880 --> 25:42.080
Oh, my God. Erm... I'll just
get the rest of my things.

25:42.080 --> 25:43.440
You'll need some clothes.

25:43.440 --> 25:45.400
Shall I, uh, drop you off
at your place?

25:45.400 --> 25:48.080
We'll take my van. They won't have
put a port check on that yet.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.680
Good thinking.
I hope you like vino bianco!

25:51.720 --> 25:53.400
I'm more of a beer man.

25:53.400 --> 25:55.720
But those Continental lagers
are delicious!

26:03.680 --> 26:05.360
I'm ready!

26:05.360 --> 26:07.560
I hope we find somewhere
where we can dance.

26:07.560 --> 26:09.320
I'm sure we will.

26:09.320 --> 26:11.080
I bought this for myself.

26:11.080 --> 26:12.560
I never even showed it to him.

26:13.800 --> 26:15.120
It's lovely.

26:15.120 --> 26:16.840
Wait till you see when it's on.

26:16.840 --> 26:18.880
It's lame, so it catches the light.

26:18.880 --> 26:22.080
Fancy. Hm. Isn't it?

26:22.080 --> 26:23.440
Listen, we've got to get going.

26:23.440 --> 26:26.400
The sooner we're on the road,
the safer it is. Yeah.

26:26.400 --> 26:28.800
Sheila, by the way.
