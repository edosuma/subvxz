WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:02.403
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...

00:02.403 --> 00:03.404
DADDY!

00:03.404 --> 00:05.136
(Emily) WHEN I WAS A CHILD,

00:05.136 --> 00:06.177
MY FATHER WAS FRAMED
FOR A CRIME HE DIDN'T COMMIT.

00:06.177 --> 00:07.178
(David) YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE!
 DADDY!

00:07.178 --> 00:08.179
AMANDA!

00:08.179 --> 00:09.440
AMANDA CLARKE
NO LONGER EXISTS.

00:09.440 --> 00:11.782
BEFORE HE DIED,
HE LEFT A ROADMAP FOR REVENGE

00:11.782 --> 00:14.685
THAT LED ME TO THE PEOPLE
WHO DESTROYED OUR LIVES.

00:14.685 --> 00:16.387
(Nolan) LYDIA DAVIS
IS ON TO YOU.

00:16.387 --> 00:17.588
HOW COULD YOU KNOW
ALL OF THIS?

00:17.588 --> 00:19.220
I-I MIGHT HAVE BUGGED
YOUR HOUSE.

00:19.220 --> 00:20.551
I CAME TO APOLOGIZE.

00:20.551 --> 00:22.593
FOR SLEEPING WITH MY HUSBAND
OR FOR BLACKMAILING US?

00:22.593 --> 00:24.125
I'M JUST HOPING TO FIND

00:24.125 --> 00:26.397
A REALLY GOOD REASON
TO STICK AROUND.

00:26.397 --> 00:28.229
WHY WOULD YOU LIE TO ME ABOUT
EMILY CANCELING OUR DATE?

00:28.229 --> 00:29.400
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO HELP.

00:29.400 --> 00:30.401
DON'T.

00:30.401 --> 00:31.402
(grunts)

00:31.402 --> 00:32.633
AH! (grunts and gasps)

00:32.633 --> 00:34.535
AAH!

00:34.535 --> 00:36.237
(Lydia) AAH! HELP!

00:36.237 --> 00:38.038
EMILY, WHERE THE HELL
ARE YOU?

00:38.038 --> 00:40.141
I THINK FRANK
JUST KILLED LYDIA.

00:42.113 --> 00:43.814
(Emily)
THEY SAY VENGEANCE TAKEN

00:43.814 --> 00:48.419
WILL TEAR THE HEART
AND TORMENT THE CONSCIENCE.

00:48.419 --> 00:50.651
IF THERE'S ANY TRUTH TO IT,

00:50.651 --> 00:53.354
THEN I NOW KNOW WITH CERTAINTY

00:53.354 --> 00:56.227
THAT THE PATH I'M ON
IS THE RIGHT ONE.

00:56.227 --> 00:57.428
HI.

00:57.428 --> 00:59.690
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU
TO WAKE UP LOOKING THIS GOOD?

00:59.690 --> 01:02.333
IT ISN'T.
YOU'RE JUST HALF ASLEEP.

01:02.333 --> 01:03.464
(chuckles)

01:03.464 --> 01:05.766
COME HERE.
I LIKE THIS DREAM.

01:16.107 --> 01:19.150
(knock on door)

01:19.150 --> 01:22.113
DON'T ANSWER IT.
THEY'LL GO AWAY.

01:23.254 --> 01:25.356
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.591
(blows air)

01:30.591 --> 01:32.123
(whispers)
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

01:32.123 --> 01:33.264
(lowered voice) WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

01:33.264 --> 01:34.695
DON'T YOU CHECK
YOUR VOICE MAIL?

01:34.695 --> 01:36.197
(lowered voice)
WHY, WHAT HAPPENED?

01:36.197 --> 01:37.428
LYDIA'S IN A COMA.

01:37.428 --> 01:38.599
THE GRAYSONS' SECURITY GUY

01:38.599 --> 01:40.471
THREW HER OFF HER BALCONY
LAST NIGHT.

01:40.471 --> 01:42.373
OH, MY GOD.

01:42.373 --> 01:44.135
WILL YOU LET ME IN? I'VE GOT
THE WHOLE THING ON VIDEO.

01:44.135 --> 01:45.436
DANIEL'S UPSTAIRS.

01:45.436 --> 01:47.338
HMM.

01:47.338 --> 01:49.240
BRAVO.

01:49.240 --> 01:50.311
(normal voice)
GET RID OF HIM.

01:52.283 --> 01:53.384
(inhales deeply)

01:53.384 --> 01:54.545
(clears throat)

01:54.545 --> 01:57.588
HEY. LOOK WHO FINALLY CLOSED
THE GIRL NEXT DOOR?

01:57.588 --> 01:59.520
HOW WAS SHE?

01:59.520 --> 02:01.292
(chuckles) FINE.
BE THAT WAY.

02:01.292 --> 02:02.493
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING
ALL SUITED UP FOR?

02:02.493 --> 02:03.794
IT'S 4th OF JULY WEEKEND.

02:03.794 --> 02:05.496
UH, YOUR DAD'S WORKING FROM
THE HOME OFFICE TODAY,

02:05.496 --> 02:07.398
AND I OFFERED MY SERVICES
OVER BREAKFAST.

02:07.398 --> 02:10.130
REGULAR
EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.762
WELL, SINCE YOU DECIDED
TO BAIL ON THE INTERNSHIP,

02:11.762 --> 02:13.764
I'M DEALING WITH
TWICE THE PRESSURE.

02:13.764 --> 02:16.407
OH, SOMETHING TELLS ME,
YOU'LL DO JUST FINE.
 THANKS.

02:16.407 --> 02:18.609
BUT DON'T WORRY. IT'S NOT
ALL WORK AND NO PLAY.

02:18.609 --> 02:21.242
I'VE GOT AN EPIC WEEKEND
PLANNED FOR US.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.674
AXE LOUNGE TOMORROW,
AFTER PARTY AT SOUTH POINTE,

02:23.674 --> 02:25.576
SURF LODGE TONIGHT,
WHICH WILL BE GREAT--

02:25.576 --> 02:26.577
I CAN'T TONIGHT.

02:26.577 --> 02:28.819
GOT PLANS WITH EMILY.

02:28.819 --> 02:30.821
DUDE, YOU'VE ALREADY
GOT HER ON THE HOOK.

02:30.821 --> 02:32.483
YOU NEED TO LET THE LINE
OUT A LITTLE BIT.

02:32.483 --> 02:34.925
I MEAN, IF YOU HANG OUT WITH HER
TWO NIGHTS IN A ROW,

02:34.925 --> 02:36.827
SHE'S GONNA START TO THINK
IT'S SERIOUS.

02:36.827 --> 02:38.589
GOOD. THAT'S THE IDEA.

02:38.589 --> 02:41.262
(chuckles)

02:41.262 --> 02:42.433
(Frank)
IT WAS ALL YOU--

02:42.433 --> 02:43.764
DESTROYING SENATOR KINGSLY,

02:43.764 --> 02:46.467
DR. BANKS,
BILL HARMON.

02:46.467 --> 02:47.898
YOU REALLY TAKE THAT WOMAN-
SCORNED THING SERIOUSLY...

02:47.898 --> 02:49.570
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
 DON'T YOU?

02:49.570 --> 02:51.342
GET OUT.

02:51.342 --> 02:52.343
(grunts)

02:52.343 --> 02:53.344
AAH! (grunts)

02:53.344 --> 02:54.245
(grunts)

02:54.245 --> 02:56.277
(Frank and Lydia
grunting)

02:59.910 --> 03:02.683
(Lydia) HELP!
SOMEBODY HELP!

03:02.683 --> 03:03.854
AAH!

03:03.854 --> 03:05.216
(thud)

03:05.216 --> 03:07.288
THAT THUD YOU HEAR
IS THE SOUND OF LYDIA

03:07.288 --> 03:08.859
HITTING THE ROOF OF THE TAXI
FIVE STORIES DOWN.

03:08.859 --> 03:11.292
I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE SURVIVED.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.763
I CAN'T BELIEVE I SURVIVED.

03:12.763 --> 03:15.596
VICTORIA, IT'S FRANK. I HAVE
SOME BAD NEWS TO REPORT.

03:15.596 --> 03:18.369
LYDIA DAVIS JUST JUMPED OFF
HER BALCONY.

03:18.369 --> 03:20.271
CALL ME WHEN YOU GET THIS.

03:20.271 --> 03:21.602
YOU KNOW, IF I'D SHOWN UP
ONE MINUTE EARLIER,

03:21.602 --> 03:22.973
THAT PSYCHOPATH
WOULDA CAUGHT ME.

03:22.973 --> 03:24.375
YEAH, BUT HE DIDN'T,

03:24.375 --> 03:27.408
AND YOU MADE IT OUT WITH
THE LIST AND THE VIDEO CAMERA.

03:27.408 --> 03:29.780
AND THIS.

03:32.943 --> 03:34.845
WE GOT LUCKY.

03:34.845 --> 03:36.847
YOU MIGHT WANT TO REVISIT
YOUR DEFINITION OF "LUCKY"

03:36.847 --> 03:38.349
IN THE DICTIONARY.

03:38.349 --> 03:40.220
LYDIA MIGHT DIE
BECAUSE OF US.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.352
IF LYDIA DIES,

03:41.352 --> 03:43.624
IT'S BECAUSE SHE SOLD HER SOUL
TO THE GRAYSONS.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.326
(sighs)

03:45.326 --> 03:46.857
THIS WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

03:46.857 --> 03:48.899
I DIDN'T SET ANY OF THIS
IN MOTION. THEY DID.

03:48.899 --> 03:50.261
FINE.

03:50.261 --> 03:51.862
LET'S SAY SHE SURVIVES,

03:51.862 --> 03:54.405
WAKES UP TOMORROW,
REMEMBERING ONLY ONE THING--

03:54.405 --> 03:55.906
THIS PICTURE.

03:55.906 --> 03:57.908
EVENTUALLY, SOMEONE'S GONNA
FIND YOU OUT.

03:57.908 --> 04:00.311
NOT IF THEY BELIEVE
IT'S ALL BEEN FRANK.

04:00.311 --> 04:03.614
AS FAR
AS THE GRAYSONS KNOW...

04:03.614 --> 04:06.317
LYDIA ATTEMPTED SUICIDE.

04:06.317 --> 04:07.818
WHEN THEY SEE THIS VIDEO,

04:07.818 --> 04:09.820
THEY'LL KNOW
THAT FRANK LIED TO THEM.

04:09.820 --> 04:11.622
LET'S SEND A COPY
TO THE POLICE.

04:11.622 --> 04:13.354
NO POLICE.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.326
FRANK DUG HIS OWN GRAVE.

04:15.326 --> 04:16.627
ALL WE NEED

04:16.627 --> 04:20.391
IS FOR VICTORIA AND CONRAD
TO BURY HIM IN IT.

04:20.391 --> 04:23.364
YOU STILL HAVE 15 INVITEES
LISTED AS MAYBES.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.995
I'LL E-MAIL
REMINDERS OUT TODAY.

04:24.995 --> 04:27.568
OH, WELL,
THIS 4th OF JULY PARTY

04:27.568 --> 04:29.269
IS A HAMPTON TRADITION
FOR 20 YEARS.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.801
ANYONE WHO NEEDS REMINDING
SHOULDN'T COME.

04:30.801 --> 04:32.002
OKAY.

04:32.002 --> 04:33.504
I THOUGHT WE MIGHT SET
THE DESSERT BUFFET

04:33.504 --> 04:36.006
HERE IN THE CONSERVATORY
RATHER THAN OUT ON THE LAWN.

04:36.006 --> 04:37.007
IT CAN GET QUITE BUGGY.

04:37.007 --> 04:38.309
FINE.

04:38.309 --> 04:40.311
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO
ACKNOWLEDGE LYDIA'S ABSENCE?

04:40.311 --> 04:42.383
...THE ISSUE.

04:42.383 --> 04:46.457
MAYBE AN OPEN SEAT AT YOUR TABLE
IN A SHOW OF SUPPORT?

04:46.457 --> 04:47.358
(indistinct conversations)

04:47.358 --> 04:48.719
MM.

04:48.719 --> 04:50.821
LET'S SEND HER
A SUPPORTIVE BOUQUET OF FLOWERS

04:50.821 --> 04:51.992
TO THE HOSPITAL.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.494
THAT SHOULD SUFFICE.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.726
I HAVE SOME ERRANDS TO RUN.
CARRY ON.

04:55.726 --> 04:57.297
OKAY.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.331
(indistinct conversations
continue)

05:03.404 --> 05:04.905
MORNING, BEAUTIFUL.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.637
HOW'S THE DRAGON LADY,
TODAY?

05:06.637 --> 05:08.639
SHE'S NOT QUITE HERSELF TODAY,
I'M AFRAID.

05:08.639 --> 05:10.411
HMM? WELL, THAT SHOULD BE
A GOOD THING, RIGHT?

05:10.411 --> 05:13.313
MM. THEORETICALLY, UNDER
THE RIGHT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES,

05:13.313 --> 05:14.915
BUT THESE ARE
DEFINITELY NOT THEM.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.987
HOW'S DINNER
AT EAST HAMPTON POINT SOUND?

05:16.987 --> 05:18.919
LIKE TODAY CAN'T BE OVER
SOON ENOUGH.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.351
THEN IT'S A DATE.

05:20.351 --> 05:23.954
(indistinct conversations)

05:23.954 --> 05:25.456
DAMN IT.

05:25.456 --> 05:26.497
WHAT?

05:26.497 --> 05:29.360
I-I PROMISED DANIEL
THAT WE'D HANG OUT TONIGHT.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.362
HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT
THE TROUBLES WITH HIS DAD.

05:31.362 --> 05:33.504
I... I'D HATE TO SEE HIM
FALL OFF THE WAGON AGAIN.

05:33.504 --> 05:35.506
WELL, FAR BE IT FROM ME
TO STAND IN THE WAY OF THAT.

05:35.506 --> 05:37.968
EMILY SHOULD BE FREE.
I'LL JUST GIVE HER A CALL.

05:37.968 --> 05:39.610
OH, WAIT. WHY--WHY DON'T WE
JUST MAKE IT A DOUBLE DATE?

05:39.610 --> 05:40.611
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

05:40.611 --> 05:41.712
IT'S A BRILLIANT IDEA.

05:41.712 --> 05:43.343
GREAT. YOU WORK IT OUT
WITH THE PRINCESS.

05:43.343 --> 05:46.377
I'LL TALK TO DANIEL AND MAKE
A RESERVATION FOR FOUR.

06:31.722 --> 06:33.564
I'M NOT SURE
HOW IT HAPPENED MYSELF.

06:33.564 --> 06:35.626

08:09.790 --> 08:11.562
YOU GOT IT.
 UH, WE JUST NEED TO PUT
THE LANTERNS

08:11.562 --> 08:12.793
OVER THE PATIO DOOR.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.725
THAT NEEDS TO GO STRAIGHT.
STRAIGHT. JUST--

08:14.725 --> 08:15.726
YEAH, STRAIGHT.

08:15.726 --> 08:17.127
ASHLEY, THIS LOOKS FANTASTIC.

08:17.127 --> 08:18.128
VERY FESTIVE.

08:18.128 --> 08:19.630
THANKS,
ALTHOUGH, I HAVE TO ADMIT,

08:19.630 --> 08:22.873
IT IS SLIGHTLY HUMILIATING,
HAVING TO PLAN A PARTY

08:22.873 --> 08:25.235
CELEBRATING
THE DEFEAT OF ENGLAND.

08:25.235 --> 08:26.737
I DON'T DO WELL
WITH REJECTION.

08:26.737 --> 08:27.978
OBVIOUSLY.

08:27.978 --> 08:30.741
THAT WAS OVER 200 YEARS AGO.

08:30.741 --> 08:32.111
IS DANIEL IN THE BACK?

08:32.111 --> 08:34.114
NO. HE AND TYLER WENT
TO GRAB SOME LUNCH.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.746
HEY, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU HAVE PLANS TONIGHT,

08:36.746 --> 08:37.717
BUT TYLER THOUGHT
IT MIGHT BE FUN

08:37.717 --> 08:38.919
IF WE ALL WENT
ON A DOUBLE DATE.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.551
ISN'T THAT SWEET?

08:40.551 --> 08:41.922
YEAH, SO SWEET. UM...

08:41.922 --> 08:43.924
BUT, YOU KNOW, THINGS ARE
VERY NEW WITH DANIEL,

08:43.924 --> 08:46.557
AND WE'RE STILL KINDA
GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

08:46.557 --> 08:49.760
THAT'S KIND OF HARD TO DO
WITH TYLER AROUND.

08:49.760 --> 08:50.961
OH, MY GOD.
YOU HATE HIM.

08:50.961 --> 08:52.132
NO, I DON'T HATE HIM.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.634
I JUST...

08:53.634 --> 08:55.065
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW HIM
VERY WELL.

08:55.065 --> 08:56.937
WELL, WHY NOT
GET TO KNOW HIM?

08:56.937 --> 08:58.639
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT
TO YOU, ISN'T IT?

08:58.639 --> 08:59.840
YES, IT IS.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.012
I WOULDN'T BE ASKING
IF IT WASN'T.

09:02.012 --> 09:04.214
I REALLY LIKE HIM, EMILY,
AND HE IS DANIEL'S BEST FRIEND.

09:04.214 --> 09:06.216
GIVE HIM A CHANCE.

09:06.216 --> 09:08.749
YOU'RE RIGHT.
COUNT US IN.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.681
SUPER.

09:10.681 --> 09:14.655
(indistinct conversations)

09:14.655 --> 09:15.986
HEY.

09:15.986 --> 09:17.728
WHAT ARE YOU, UH,

09:17.728 --> 09:18.929
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

09:18.929 --> 09:20.661
YOUR TEXT SAID
YOU WANTED TO TALK?

09:20.661 --> 09:22.162
YEAH, BUT, I, UH...

09:22.162 --> 09:23.934
I WAS GONNA COME TO YOU.

09:23.934 --> 09:27.067
SO DID YOU OR DIDN'T YOU
WANT TO TALK?

09:27.067 --> 09:29.640
OKAY, YEAH.
UH, HERE IS FINE.

09:29.640 --> 09:30.841
CAN WE, UH...

09:30.841 --> 09:34.074
(indistinct conversations
continue)

09:34.074 --> 09:35.706
ALL RIGHT.

09:35.706 --> 09:36.947
UM...

09:36.947 --> 09:39.710
SO FAR, I'VE TRIED TAKING YOU
SAILING WITHOUT A BOAT,

09:39.710 --> 09:42.783
GOTTEN MY FACE BASHED IN
BY YOUR EX, AND BEEN ARRESTED.

09:42.783 --> 09:45.716
SO YOU DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE
THIS CRIME SPREE WITH ME?

09:45.716 --> 09:46.687
NO, WHAT I--WHAT I WANT

09:46.687 --> 09:48.659
IS TO TAKE YOU OUT
ON A REAL DATE.

09:48.659 --> 09:49.960
OKAY. YEAH, GREAT.

09:49.960 --> 09:51.091
YOU SAID GREAT?

09:51.091 --> 09:52.923
YOU WANTED
A DIFFERENT ANSWER?

09:52.923 --> 09:54.765
NO, NO. UH,
HOW ABOUT THIS WEEKEND?

09:54.765 --> 09:56.096
SURE.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.268
OH, BUT MY PARENTS THROW
THIS BIG PARTY EVERY YEAR

09:58.268 --> 10:00.731
FOR THE 4th,
AND I KIND OF HAVE TO BE THERE.

10:00.731 --> 10:01.872
YOU SHOULD COME.

10:01.872 --> 10:03.233
TO YOUR PARENTS' PARTY?

10:03.233 --> 10:04.975
I DON'T THINK SO.

10:04.975 --> 10:07.607
BUT I--I'M--I'M GONNA
HOLD YOU TO OUR DATE.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.610
OKAY.

10:12.683 --> 10:15.686
(jazz music playing)

10:15.686 --> 10:17.818
(indistinct conversations)

10:17.818 --> 10:19.650
HEY, FRANK.

10:19.650 --> 10:20.791
HAVE A SEAT.

10:20.791 --> 10:22.022
WATER.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.754
OKAY.

10:23.754 --> 10:26.827
(indistinct conversations
continue)

10:26.827 --> 10:28.759
(lowered voice) WE'VE BEEN
THROUGH A LOT TOGETHER.

10:28.759 --> 10:30.801
WE CERTAINLY HAVE.

10:30.801 --> 10:32.833
TOO MUCH, I THINK.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.936
I THINK THE TIME HAS COME
FOR US TO GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.938
(indistinct conversations
continue)

10:37.938 --> 10:39.870
(sighs)

10:39.870 --> 10:41.641
(lowered voice)
ARE YOU FIRING ME?

10:41.641 --> 10:43.744
NO. FIRING IS NOT
THE WORD I'D USE.

10:43.744 --> 10:46.777
AFTER 20 YEARS
OF SERVICE,

10:46.777 --> 10:49.950
WHAT WORD WOULD YOU USE?

10:49.950 --> 10:51.221
OKAY.

10:51.221 --> 10:53.323
ALL RIGHT.
YOU WANT TO HEAR THE TRUTH?

10:53.323 --> 10:55.686
(indistinct conversations
continue)

10:55.686 --> 10:57.788
(inhales and clears throat)

10:57.788 --> 10:59.790
FOR WHATEVER REASON,
YOU'VE CHOSEN TO SHOW

10:59.790 --> 11:02.062
A DEEPER LOYALTY TO MY WIFE
THAN TO ME.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.393
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

11:03.393 --> 11:04.895
OH, COME ON.
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY

11:04.895 --> 11:06.897
VICTORIA COULD'VE FOUND OUT
ABOUT THE CHECK I WROTE TO LYDIA

11:06.897 --> 11:08.238
FROM THE CAYMAN ACCOUNT,

11:08.238 --> 11:10.100
AND THAT WAS FROM YOU.

11:10.100 --> 11:12.402
NOW EXACTLY WHY YOU CHOSE
TO BREACH MY TRUST,

11:12.402 --> 11:13.774
I CAN ONLY SPECULATE.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.345
BUT THE NET RESULT IS THE SAME

11:15.345 --> 11:17.377
NO MATTER HOW
YOU DO THE MATH, FRANK.

11:17.377 --> 11:18.909
I CAN'T TRUST YOU ANYMORE.

11:18.909 --> 11:21.712
YOU CAN'T TRUST ME?

11:21.712 --> 11:24.885
YOU WOULDN'T BE SITTING HERE
IF IT WASN'T FOR ME?

11:24.885 --> 11:26.256
(indistinct conversations
continue)

11:26.256 --> 11:29.419
YOU'D BE IN A FEDERAL PRISON,
ROTTING...

11:29.419 --> 11:32.262
AND DAVID CLARKE
WOULD STILL BE ALIVE.

11:32.262 --> 11:34.795
YEAH, WHICH IS WHY
I WROTE A SECOND CHECK

11:34.795 --> 11:36.096
IN YOUR NAME.

11:36.096 --> 11:39.029
NOW I THINK YOU'LL SEE THAT IT
REFLECTS MY DEEPEST LOYALTY

11:39.029 --> 11:40.931
AND APPRECIATION

11:40.931 --> 11:42.432
FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

11:42.432 --> 11:44.434
MY JET'S ALL FUELED UP,

11:44.434 --> 11:46.206
READY TO TAKE YOU ANYWHERE
YOU WANT TO GO.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.477
(indistinct conversations
continue)

11:47.477 --> 11:52.082
I SUGGEST YOU GO SOMEPLACE
VERY FAR AWAY FROM HERE.

11:52.082 --> 11:55.085
(indistinct conversations
continue)

12:07.497 --> 12:09.800
(knock on door)

12:16.136 --> 12:17.938
JACK, HI.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.870
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

12:19.870 --> 12:21.942
I CAN'T LET THIS
GO ON ANY LONGER.

12:23.073 --> 12:24.945
THAT PORCH SWING
HAS BEEN NEGLECTED

12:24.945 --> 12:26.076
FOR LONG ENOUGH.

12:26.076 --> 12:27.848
(laughs)

12:29.079 --> 12:31.822
THAT'S REALLY SWEET OF YOU.

12:31.822 --> 12:33.824
WELL, I FEEL OBLIGATED

12:33.824 --> 12:36.756
'CAUSE I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST
PEOPLE TO SWING ON IT.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.859
WHEN I WAS A KID, I KNEW
THE FAMILY THAT LIVED HERE.

12:38.859 --> 12:39.860
(toolbox squeaks)

12:39.860 --> 12:42.893
IT WAS A LITTLE GIRL
AND HER DAD.

12:42.893 --> 12:45.495
HE ALWAYS WANTED TO MOVE IT
OVER TO THAT CORNER

12:45.495 --> 12:47.337
SO IT WOULD FACE
THE SUNRISE.

12:47.337 --> 12:49.970
THAT WOULD MAKE
A LOT OF SENSE.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.342
WELL, HE NEVER GOT
AROUND TO IT, SO...

12:53.904 --> 12:55.205
EVENING, ALL.

12:56.877 --> 12:57.878
HEY, BOSS.

12:57.878 --> 13:00.010
GRAYSON.

13:00.010 --> 13:01.982
UM... JACK

13:01.982 --> 13:04.014
CAME BY TO FIX
THE PORCH SWING.

13:04.014 --> 13:05.015
NICE.

13:05.015 --> 13:06.556
WOW. WHO KNEW YOU WERE
A TRIPLE THREAT--

13:06.556 --> 13:08.959
BARTENDER, CAPTAIN,
AND HANDYMAN?

13:08.959 --> 13:10.360
(chuckles)

13:10.360 --> 13:12.963
UH, DANIEL AND I
ARE GOING FOR DINNER.

13:12.963 --> 13:14.995
I'M GONNA GRAB MY PURSE.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.166
OKAY.

13:22.032 --> 13:23.203
SO...

13:23.203 --> 13:24.905
LOOKING FORWARD
TO STARTING WORK.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.907
YEAH? I WASN'T SURE YOU WERE
SERIOUS ABOUT THE JOB.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.879
I WAS. I AM.
 GOOD.

13:28.879 --> 13:30.380
YOU KNOW, IF I REALIZED
THAT YOU WERE FREE,

13:30.380 --> 13:32.382
I WOULD'VE STARTED YOU
TONIGHT.

13:32.382 --> 13:33.984
BUT THAT'LL HAVE TO BE
TOMORROW.

13:33.984 --> 13:35.345
TOMORROW'S THE 4th.

13:35.345 --> 13:36.917
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

13:36.917 --> 13:37.918
(footsteps approach)

13:37.918 --> 13:39.589
NO. I'LL BE THERE.

13:42.552 --> 13:44.194
READY.

13:45.896 --> 13:47.127
JACK, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.899
HEY.

13:53.403 --> 13:55.065
(sighs)

13:55.065 --> 13:59.970
THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN
ONE OF MY FAVORITE SIGHTS...

13:59.970 --> 14:02.913
YOU, THE SUNSET...

14:02.913 --> 14:07.017
THIS BEAUTIFUL PIECE
OF THE WORLD THAT WE SHARE.

14:07.017 --> 14:08.919
WELL, THAT'S FUNNY.

14:08.919 --> 14:10.420
I WAS JUST THINKING

14:10.420 --> 14:12.953
HOW IT'S ONE OF
THE LONELIEST PLACES ON EARTH.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.084
AH.

14:14.084 --> 14:15.585
WELL...

14:15.585 --> 14:17.327
YEAH, TONIGHT...

14:17.327 --> 14:20.090
TONIGHT, MAYBE.

14:20.090 --> 14:22.862
BUT TOMORROW'S A NEW DAY.

DO YOU LOVE HER,
CONRAD?

14:27.067 --> 14:30.540

AND I ALWAYS HAVE.

14:30.540 --> 14:32.943
WELL, THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
HOW FRANK TELLS IT.

14:32.943 --> 14:34.975
HE SAYS THAT YOU'RE
OBSESSED WITH LYDIA.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.977
THAT'S BECAUSE FRANK
IS OBSESSED WITH YOU.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.108
WELL, THAT'S ABSURD.

14:38.108 --> 14:40.510
ARE YOU GOING TO DENY THAT
YOU HAD THIS AFFAIR NOW?

14:40.510 --> 14:42.112
NO, NO, I'M NOT.

14:42.112 --> 14:43.914
I'M SAYING THAT EVERYTHING
FRANK'S BEEN FEEDING YOU

14:43.914 --> 14:45.956
HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO DRIVE
A WEDGE BETWEEN US.

14:45.956 --> 14:48.188
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID
YOU'D TELL ME.

14:50.520 --> 14:53.023
LYDIA DIDN'T JUMP OFF
THE BALCONY, VICTORIA.

14:53.023 --> 14:54.394
SHE WAS SCREAMING FOR HELP

14:54.394 --> 14:56.196
WHEN SHE WENT OVER THE EDGE.

14:58.528 --> 15:00.330
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

15:00.330 --> 15:02.672

AH! AAH!
