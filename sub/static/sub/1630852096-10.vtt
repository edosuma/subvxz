00:07.050 --> 00:09.096
<i>Previously</i> <i>
on</i> Star Trek: Discovery...

00:09.139 --> 00:10.271
Mr. Saru.

00:10.314 --> 00:12.012
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

00:12.055 --> 00:14.797
Not at all. It is always
a pleasure to hear from you.

00:14.840 --> 00:16.059
Do you have feelings for her?

00:16.103 --> 00:17.800
Perhaps I do.

00:17.843 --> 00:20.237
The power source
that controls the device,

00:20.281 --> 00:22.326
I need it to go home.

00:22.370 --> 00:24.502
- A place where we could be free.
- Who's "we"?

00:24.546 --> 00:26.896
A friend.

00:26.939 --> 00:28.506
A scientist, like me.

00:28.550 --> 00:30.334
I took what I learned
about the device

00:30.378 --> 00:33.642
at the center of the DMA
and designed this,

00:33.685 --> 00:36.123
a weapon capable
of destroying it.

00:36.166 --> 00:38.081
And what I'm about
to propose is a plan

00:38.125 --> 00:40.083
President Rillak
and Admiral Vance approved.

00:40.127 --> 00:41.693
If that fails,

00:41.737 --> 00:44.044
they'll back your plan
to destroy the controller.

00:44.087 --> 00:46.959
We'll stand down for a week.

00:47.003 --> 00:48.787
- What are you doing?
- I'm being clearheaded.

00:48.831 --> 00:49.875
No!

00:52.791 --> 00:54.750
It's not here.
The power source--

00:54.793 --> 00:57.144
it's powered from the other side
of the wormhole.

00:57.187 --> 00:58.797
Outside the galaxy.

00:58.841 --> 01:01.539
A new DMA has appeared?

01:01.583 --> 01:03.933
- In the exact same place.
- What happens now?

01:03.976 --> 01:05.630
The admiral's implementing
emergency protocols

01:05.674 --> 01:07.284
in case of retaliation.

01:08.633 --> 01:10.766
We're fast-tracking
the first contact mission.

01:14.900 --> 01:18.904
Whatever we think we know
about Species Ten-C,

01:18.948 --> 01:21.429
we're wrong.

01:21.472 --> 01:26.869
However we think first contact
will go, it won't.

01:26.912 --> 01:29.698
The fact that the DMA controller
was destroyed

01:29.741 --> 01:33.441
then reappeared
tells us nothing concrete.

01:33.484 --> 01:37.271
Our mere arrival
could be perceived

01:37.314 --> 01:39.403
as an act of aggression.

01:39.447 --> 01:42.450
We did attack their technology
with an isolytic weapon.

01:42.493 --> 01:43.973
We did not.

01:44.016 --> 01:46.193
Tarka and Booker
acted unilaterally.

01:46.236 --> 01:48.543
How would the Ten-C
know the difference?

01:48.586 --> 01:50.893
We have to find a way
to communicate the distinction.

01:50.936 --> 01:52.721
Isn't that what all these
translators are for?

01:52.764 --> 01:56.594
No, they're here in case
you feel like translating

01:56.638 --> 01:59.554
confirmation bias
from Federation Standard

01:59.597 --> 02:00.772
into Klingon.

02:05.908 --> 02:07.736
Confirmation bias.

02:07.779 --> 02:10.782
He's saying the universal
translator's been so successful

02:10.826 --> 02:15.396
because we tend to look for
and find what's familiar to us.

02:15.439 --> 02:18.312
Species that communicate
verbally, for example.

02:18.355 --> 02:20.618
But since we know nothing
about the Ten-C,

02:20.662 --> 02:24.405
it's naive to assume
the translator would even work.

02:29.105 --> 02:30.585
It was funny.

02:31.934 --> 02:35.720
Dr. Hirai is a specialist
in astrolinguistics,

02:35.764 --> 02:39.637
uh, xenophonology
and theoretical semiotics.

02:39.681 --> 02:40.899
If I may,

02:40.943 --> 02:43.424
the very purpose
of this task force

02:43.467 --> 02:47.254
is to establish the parameters
for successful communications.

02:47.297 --> 02:48.907
Are you both now suggesting
that may be impossible?

02:48.951 --> 02:50.518
Vulcan surveyed Earth

02:50.561 --> 02:53.869
for almost a century
before making first contact.

02:53.912 --> 02:56.915
<i>Discovery</i> leaves
in fewer than 24 hours.

02:56.959 --> 02:59.309
We have to start the
communication process somewhere.

02:59.353 --> 03:01.224
The oversight committee
has questions.

03:01.268 --> 03:02.921
As do the planetary delegates.

03:02.965 --> 03:05.054
It's nice that
they're all so eager

03:05.097 --> 03:08.057
for a three-hour tour
outside the galaxy.

03:08.100 --> 03:10.451
It will take longer
than three hours.

03:10.494 --> 03:11.887
Figure of speech.

03:11.930 --> 03:13.628
Ah.

03:13.671 --> 03:15.369
Point being,

03:15.412 --> 03:19.242
I understand their emotional
desire to be present

03:19.286 --> 03:20.635
when we make contact.

03:20.678 --> 03:22.289
I wish I could be there myself.

03:22.332 --> 03:24.726
- You're not coming?
- Unfortunately,

03:24.769 --> 03:27.859
there are other urgent matters
that I must attend to.

03:27.903 --> 03:31.298
I cannot fathom anything
even remotely as urgent as this.

03:31.341 --> 03:33.387
And I intend to keep it that way.

03:33.430 --> 03:35.780
You're in good hands
with Dr. Hirai.

03:37.086 --> 03:38.609
Uh, Madam President, Admiral.

03:38.653 --> 03:39.958
If you'll come with me.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.614
Scan data shows
that the new DMA controller

03:43.658 --> 03:47.749
is the same size
but significantly more powerful

03:47.792 --> 03:50.012
than the one that Tarka
and Book destroyed.

03:50.055 --> 03:53.233
It's churning through space
at a much faster rate.

03:53.276 --> 03:55.670
How long before it moves
to a new harvesting location?

03:55.713 --> 03:57.367
12 hours at most.

03:57.411 --> 03:59.151
Are we looking at a precursor

03:59.195 --> 04:00.675
for a retaliatory attack?

04:00.718 --> 04:03.373
There's no way to know, sir.

04:03.417 --> 04:05.114
Any word from Mr. Booker?

04:05.157 --> 04:07.769
He and Tarka cannot escalate
this situation further.

04:07.812 --> 04:08.987
I have not heard
from him, ma'am.

04:09.031 --> 04:10.772
But given the new timetable,

04:10.815 --> 04:13.209
I think we should make first
contact as soon as possible.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.298
A number of delegates
are still on their way,

04:15.342 --> 04:17.822
including the representative
from Ni'Var.

04:21.261 --> 04:24.133
But I agree,
we can't afford to wait.

04:24.176 --> 04:26.527
How soon can you
be ready, Captain?

04:26.570 --> 04:27.876
Two hours.

04:27.919 --> 04:29.660
To finish loading
and to give my crew

04:29.704 --> 04:31.836
time to say their goodbyes.

04:32.837 --> 04:33.969
Two hours it is.

04:34.012 --> 04:36.754
Yes, sir. Madam President.

04:47.939 --> 04:50.333
It's a hell of a thing.

04:50.377 --> 04:52.074
Yes, it is.

04:56.992 --> 04:59.560
Admiral, it's my constitutional
duty to inform you

04:59.603 --> 05:02.389
that I'm transferring power
to the vice president.

05:04.739 --> 05:06.175
Excuse me?

05:06.218 --> 05:08.090
I'll be joining the mission.

05:08.133 --> 05:09.744
Madam President, you...

05:09.787 --> 05:13.051
I was the Federation's
top ambassador for 20 years.

05:13.095 --> 05:17.317
Given the complexities
that we'll face,

05:17.360 --> 05:19.841
I believe my skills
will be needed.

05:19.884 --> 05:22.757
They're leaving the galaxy.
We've never done that.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.367
You know as well as I do, <i>
Discovery</i> might not

05:24.411 --> 05:25.977
be coming back from this.

05:26.021 --> 05:28.284
Which is why
I am counting on you

05:28.328 --> 05:31.287
to support the vice president
in my absence.

05:33.245 --> 05:35.857
However long it may be.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.469
Laira.

05:39.513 --> 05:41.210
You are the Federation now.

05:42.211 --> 05:43.560
What your presence means,

05:43.604 --> 05:45.388
what you represent...

05:45.432 --> 05:47.390
Makes it all the more crucial

05:47.434 --> 05:51.046
that I be there
when we make contact.

05:54.919 --> 05:57.008
I can't talk you
out of this, can I?

05:57.052 --> 05:58.706
No.

05:58.749 --> 06:01.448
But you have gotten us
through so much.

06:01.491 --> 06:04.625
Wherever the DMA
goes next, what...

06:04.668 --> 06:06.670
whatever is to come...

06:08.629 --> 06:11.458
...I know you'll get us
through that, too.

06:16.114 --> 06:18.465
Found a habitable planet
nearby for you.

06:18.508 --> 06:20.118
They haven't discovered
electricity yet,

06:20.162 --> 06:22.338
but you'll do fine.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.601
Here's your bag.
We'll be there in a few minutes.

06:24.645 --> 06:26.124
Hold on.

06:26.168 --> 06:27.909
I understand that you're
a little upset, but...

06:27.952 --> 06:30.477
The DMA's back and more powerful
because you wouldn't stand down.

06:30.520 --> 06:34.176
All evidence pointed
to an internal power source.

06:34.219 --> 06:38.310
That's science.
Hypothesize, test, iterate.

06:38.354 --> 06:40.312
Now, thanks to me,
we know the power source

06:40.356 --> 06:43.446
has to be outside the galaxy,
within the Ten-C's hyperfield.

06:43.490 --> 06:44.969
You're welcome.

06:45.013 --> 06:46.493
And just to be clear,
I didn't stand down

06:46.536 --> 06:48.712
because I was
following our plan.

06:48.756 --> 06:50.235
We both acted unilaterally,

06:50.279 --> 06:52.020
but only one of us
put more lives at risk.

06:52.063 --> 06:54.065
I got the hyperfield
coordinates from Haz.

06:55.676 --> 06:57.634
I'm stopping the DMA
before it moves again.

06:57.678 --> 07:00.550
And how do you expect to get
through the galactic barrier?

07:00.594 --> 07:02.596
You must know
the mycelial network

07:02.639 --> 07:04.075
can't exist in there, right?

07:04.119 --> 07:05.947
You have to jump up
as close as you can get.

07:05.990 --> 07:08.776
The barrier has some
especially nasty sections.

07:08.819 --> 07:10.517
The negative energy
will eat through shields

07:10.560 --> 07:13.389
and fry a frontal cortex
like that.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.697
But surely you have a plan.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.133
I'll figure something out.

07:18.176 --> 07:19.482
Assuming you make it,
how do you plan

07:19.526 --> 07:21.832
to find the power supply
and remove it?

07:21.876 --> 07:24.052
Come on, tell me.
Hit me with it.

07:24.095 --> 07:28.056
You're an asshole.
You know that?

07:28.099 --> 07:31.407
I'm also the guy who created
a working model of the DMA

07:31.451 --> 07:33.801
without ever having seen it.

07:33.844 --> 07:36.630
How do we get through
the barrier?

07:36.673 --> 07:39.241
Programmable antimatter.

07:39.284 --> 07:41.417
We need to apply it
to our shields.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.375
<i>Discovery</i> will have
to do the same thing.

07:43.419 --> 07:44.855
It'll repel negative energy

07:44.899 --> 07:47.467
like two magnets
with the same polarity.

07:47.510 --> 07:49.120
And how will you find some
without getting us caught

07:49.164 --> 07:51.122
in the process?

07:51.166 --> 07:53.429
Surely you have a plan.

07:54.430 --> 07:56.867
I know where there's a stash.

08:01.219 --> 08:04.353
Discovery will leave as soon
as shield upgrades are complete.

08:04.396 --> 08:06.790
I'm sorry you won't be
joining us, Commander Bryce,

08:06.834 --> 08:09.184
but I trust your work
for Dr. Kovich is going well?

08:09.227 --> 08:11.055
It is.

08:11.099 --> 08:13.493
Uh, not sure we'll figure out
galactic-barrier communication

08:13.536 --> 08:14.972
soon enough to help
with first contact,

08:15.016 --> 08:18.498
but a breakthrough anytime
would be huge.

08:18.541 --> 08:21.631
I mean, the possibilities
it would open up,

08:21.675 --> 08:23.938
everything that's beyond
our galaxy to explore,

08:23.981 --> 08:26.331
I-I'm pretty excited, obviously.

08:27.332 --> 08:28.943
I-I'll miss you guys, though.

08:28.986 --> 08:31.467
A voyage of this kind
without you

08:31.511 --> 08:33.556
will be quite the adjustment.

08:34.601 --> 08:37.342
Though I am happy for you

08:37.386 --> 08:40.084
and the opportunities
this has created.

08:40.128 --> 08:42.347
Good luck out there.

08:42.391 --> 08:46.264
And thank you, Mr. Saru,
for everything.

09:06.415 --> 09:08.722
Madam President.

09:08.765 --> 09:10.158
Do you have a moment?

09:10.201 --> 09:11.812
Of course.

09:11.855 --> 09:13.640
When last we spoke,

09:13.683 --> 09:16.381
you suggested
we might share a meal.

09:16.425 --> 09:18.209
I would very much like
to take you up on that offer.

09:18.253 --> 09:21.256
But <i>Discovery</i>

09:21.299 --> 09:23.867
is leaving very shortly and...

09:23.911 --> 09:26.870
as you know, we may not...

09:30.831 --> 09:33.007
So, I thought I should...

09:33.050 --> 09:35.836
...um, tell you, while I'm able,

09:35.879 --> 09:39.491
how much our new friendship
has meant to me.

09:41.232 --> 09:44.627
And how much I've enjoyed
working alongside you.

09:46.890 --> 09:49.980
In any event,

09:50.024 --> 09:53.331
I feel as if

09:53.375 --> 09:55.812
there could be something here...

09:57.771 --> 10:00.643
...perhaps more
than a friendship?

10:05.735 --> 10:09.826
Uh, Mr. Saru,
if you will excuse me.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.263
Ah...

10:16.441 --> 10:18.618
- Ensign Tal.
- Hi.

10:18.661 --> 10:19.836
Welcome back.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.838
- Thank you.
- How is Gray?

10:21.882 --> 10:23.579
Uh, he's-he's great.

10:23.623 --> 10:27.496
Um, he's really enjoying
his guardian training.

10:27.539 --> 10:30.194
I think we're both
right where we need to be.

10:30.238 --> 10:31.631
I'm glad you feel that way.

10:31.674 --> 10:33.241
It's really good
to have you with us again.

10:33.284 --> 10:35.069
Isn't it? I mean,
they've already

10:35.112 --> 10:37.941
put us ahead of schedule with
the shield upgrades, and now

10:37.985 --> 10:39.813
they're off to monitor
the forward emitters

10:39.856 --> 10:41.162
for the mission.

10:41.205 --> 10:43.468
It's really not that big a deal.

10:43.512 --> 10:45.079
It is, though.

10:45.122 --> 10:47.603
They're gonna take a lot
of damage along the way,

10:47.647 --> 10:49.039
and if you're not
repairing them,

10:49.083 --> 10:50.650
we won't make it
through the barrier at all.

10:52.260 --> 10:56.133
I think I'm gonna j...
go back to work.

10:56.177 --> 10:58.614
If that's okay. Um, Captain.

11:04.228 --> 11:05.926
Hang in there.

11:05.969 --> 11:07.405
You're doing great.

11:12.062 --> 11:14.630
<i>
Captain, the president</i> <i>
is ready for you.</i>

11:20.897 --> 11:23.378
Given some of the issues
that came up

11:23.421 --> 11:25.032
on our last mission together,

11:25.075 --> 11:27.208
I thought we should take
a moment to speak frankly.

11:27.251 --> 11:28.470
Please.

11:29.950 --> 11:32.909
If I'm to bring us through
the galactic barrier safely,

11:32.953 --> 11:35.346
I can't have you questioning
my orders on the bridge.

11:35.390 --> 11:37.914
I presume we're now clear

11:37.958 --> 11:42.223
on the difference between asking
a question and questioning?

11:42.266 --> 11:45.313
We are. But I hope it's also
clear that introducing doubt

11:45.356 --> 11:48.142
amongst my crew
could endanger the ship.

11:48.185 --> 11:49.970
It is.

11:50.013 --> 11:52.407
And understood.

11:52.450 --> 11:54.670
- Thank you.
- You should also know

11:54.714 --> 11:58.761
this is all quite delicate, politically.

11:58.805 --> 12:02.634
I need to manage this situation
as I see fit.

12:02.678 --> 12:05.725
So, while your
xenoanthropological expertise

12:05.768 --> 12:09.293
is invaluable
to the first contact task force,

12:09.337 --> 12:12.253
it will need
to remain my task force.

12:13.428 --> 12:15.299
The ship and crew
are my purview,

12:15.343 --> 12:17.998
diplomacy and delegates
are yours.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.956
Sounds like progress.

12:21.044 --> 12:22.872
<i>
All crew,</i>

12:22.916 --> 12:25.570
<i>prepare for departure.</i>

12:25.614 --> 12:28.182
Ah. All additional supplies
are loaded and secured, Captain.

12:28.225 --> 12:31.185
And the delegates?
Uh, settled in.

12:31.228 --> 12:32.795
I believe there
is an Earth simile,

12:32.839 --> 12:35.493
something to do with...
"herding cats"?

12:35.537 --> 12:37.234
I can imagine.

12:37.278 --> 12:38.496
Commander Nilsson?

12:38.540 --> 12:39.802
The mycelial network thins

12:39.846 --> 12:41.543
as it approaches
the galactic barrier,

12:41.586 --> 12:43.023
so Commander Stamets expects us

12:43.066 --> 12:44.764
to arrive about
four light-years away.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.417
We'll warp from there.

12:46.461 --> 12:48.724
Thank you. Commander Detmer,
take us to safe distance.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.160
- Aye, Captain.
- Lieutenant Christopher,

12:50.204 --> 12:51.292
open a shipwide channel.

12:51.335 --> 12:52.859
Aye, Captain.

12:52.902 --> 12:55.775
Channel's open.

12:55.818 --> 12:59.648
<i>Discovery,</i> delegates,

12:59.691 --> 13:03.391
when I was a child,
I, like many of you,

13:03.434 --> 13:07.699
dreamed of going
where no one has gone before.

13:07.743 --> 13:08.875
None of us could've
imagined it would be

13:08.918 --> 13:10.833
under these circumstances,

13:10.877 --> 13:14.054
with so much uncertainty,
so much at stake.

13:14.097 --> 13:17.057
We don't know what we'll find,

13:17.100 --> 13:19.059
we don't know
how we'll be received.

13:19.102 --> 13:21.365
Once we enter
the galactic barrier,

13:21.409 --> 13:23.803
we'll be beyond comms contact
and on our own.

13:23.846 --> 13:26.240
Innumerable worlds
are counting on us

13:26.283 --> 13:29.809
to make first contact and ensure
Species Ten-C stops the DMA

13:29.852 --> 13:32.681
<i>before it can do</i> <i>
any more harm.</i>

13:32.724 --> 13:34.074
<i>It won't be easy.</i>

13:34.117 --> 13:35.815
<i>But with this crew,</i>

13:35.858 --> 13:40.297
<i>with these leaders</i> <i>
and delegates united,</i>

13:40.341 --> 13:42.473
<i>I know that we'll succeed.</i>

13:42.517 --> 13:43.997
Black alert.

13:46.303 --> 13:48.436
Let's fly.

13:59.447 --> 14:02.406
Godspeed, <i>Discovery.</i>

15:39.590 --> 15:41.984
<i>
Not the view I was expecting.</i>

15:42.028 --> 15:43.899
Where are we in relation
to the galactic barrier?

15:43.943 --> 15:46.684
It looks like we're
nine light-years away.

15:46.728 --> 15:49.687
Commander Stamets,
you owe me five light-years.

15:49.731 --> 15:51.428
<i>This is going to put us</i> <i>
behind schedule.</i>

15:51.472 --> 15:54.040
I'm sorry, Captain.
We've never been out this far.

15:54.083 --> 15:56.694
Uh, it's not an exact science.

15:56.738 --> 15:58.087
<i>I got us as close as I could.</i>

15:58.131 --> 15:59.697
Can you update the delegates?

15:59.741 --> 16:01.395
Of course.

16:01.438 --> 16:03.397
Commander Detmer, set a course
for the galactic barrier.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.486
The DMA will move soon.
We don't have much time.

16:05.529 --> 16:08.315
- Maximum warp.
- Aye, Captain.

16:08.358 --> 16:11.448
Dr. Culber, if you are able,

16:11.492 --> 16:13.015
I would appreciate
your assistance

16:13.059 --> 16:15.626
in spreading the word that...

16:18.934 --> 16:20.457
Madam President?

16:20.501 --> 16:24.853
I was not aware
that you would be joining us.

16:24.896 --> 16:27.290
Our delegate did not
arrive in time.

16:27.334 --> 16:29.510
It was decided that
Ni'Var must be represented,

16:29.553 --> 16:31.381
even if by its president.

16:31.425 --> 16:33.253
I see.

16:33.296 --> 16:34.558
Do not let me delay you
any further.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.174
You said something to her,
didn't you?

16:41.217 --> 16:43.132
Good for you.

16:43.176 --> 16:46.483
I would never have done so had
I known she would be joining us.

16:46.527 --> 16:49.443
That we would see each other
in meetings every single day.

16:49.486 --> 16:51.619
Oh, beginnings can be messy.
That's all right.

16:51.662 --> 16:53.490
Ah, I cannot envision

16:53.534 --> 16:56.058
any situation more awkward
than this.

16:56.102 --> 16:57.451
When I first met Paul,

16:57.494 --> 17:00.454
those blue eyes,
I'm telling you.

17:00.497 --> 17:01.977
Anyway, I thought
I'd totally blown it.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.761
I obsessed over every word.

17:03.805 --> 17:08.070
He was... so brilliant,
and blunt.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.550
Anyhow, it's not just you.

17:09.593 --> 17:11.856
Insecurity is universal,
and totally normal.

17:11.900 --> 17:13.554
It's okay.

17:15.469 --> 17:18.080
Oh, it is helpful to realize

17:18.124 --> 17:22.606
that I am not alone in being
made foolish by such feelings.

17:22.650 --> 17:24.391
I am grateful you shared.

17:24.434 --> 17:26.610
- So am I.
- Now, let us inform the delegates.

17:26.654 --> 17:29.178
They will want news of our delay
as soon as possible.

17:37.665 --> 17:40.102
You said we couldn't beam up
the programmable antimatter.

17:40.146 --> 17:42.278
I don't see any
shield generators here.

17:42.322 --> 17:45.890
This friend of yours
who told you about this place,

17:45.934 --> 17:47.283
who was he, exactly?

17:47.327 --> 17:48.850
Doesn't matter.

17:57.989 --> 17:59.600
What the hell
are you playing at?

17:59.643 --> 18:01.297
- What?
- You think I don't know an Emerald Chain

18:01.341 --> 18:02.690
work camp when I see one?

18:02.733 --> 18:04.518
- It's not what you think.
- Then what is it?

18:05.867 --> 18:07.912
<i>MALE</i> <i>
Attention, cell breach.</i>

18:07.956 --> 18:09.523
<i>Attention, cell breach.</i>

18:11.046 --> 18:12.874
- What are you keeping from me?
- Nothing.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.832
- Answer me!
- Nothing.

18:14.876 --> 18:18.140
Listen to me. The camp has been
out of commission for years.

18:23.928 --> 18:26.496
It was here, wasn't it?
Where you were held prisoner?

18:28.455 --> 18:30.152
We're not going anywhere
until you tell me.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.851
Yes, it was here.

18:34.852 --> 18:36.680
<i>Almost ten years ago.</i>

18:39.988 --> 18:41.772
You're interrupting my work.

18:41.816 --> 18:43.992
Osyraa wants to fast-track
your design.

18:44.035 --> 18:46.429
Since you lost your last helper,
she's giving you a new one.

18:54.045 --> 18:55.917
A real charmer, that one.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.840
Impressive design.

19:05.883 --> 19:10.018
It's a dilithium-alternative
engine, right?

19:10.061 --> 19:12.412
They've had me
working on one, too.

19:14.805 --> 19:17.330
But those equations
are for something else.

19:19.419 --> 19:22.378
I didn't ask for help.

19:22.422 --> 19:25.294
Well, I didn't ask to be here,
but lucky for you, I am.

19:25.338 --> 19:27.514
Where am I supposed to sleep?

19:33.998 --> 19:37.611
This... uh, good spot.

19:39.656 --> 19:42.311
How long you been here?

19:42.355 --> 19:46.576
I'd rather not engage
in personal conversation.

19:46.620 --> 19:49.840
Just work, then.
That's fine by me.

19:53.409 --> 19:55.759
<i>
The scientist friend</i> <i>
you told me about,</i>

19:55.803 --> 19:57.892
this was him?

19:57.935 --> 20:01.112
Oros.

20:01.156 --> 20:03.202
His name was Oros.

20:03.245 --> 20:05.116
We weren't friends at first.

20:05.160 --> 20:09.599
But it was a relief to have
someone to talk to again.

20:09.643 --> 20:11.645
For both of us.

20:11.688 --> 20:13.342
You should rest.

20:13.386 --> 20:15.605
You can't work
all day and all night.

20:17.085 --> 20:18.565
I'm fine.

20:21.959 --> 20:23.352
What are you working on?

20:23.396 --> 20:26.616
Just running some numbers.

20:26.660 --> 20:30.446
Looks like galactic
proper-distance equations,

20:30.490 --> 20:33.580
but there's a variable
you're using I don't recognize.

20:35.712 --> 20:37.714
I was alone in a cell.

20:37.758 --> 20:40.282
Had to pass the time somehow.
I ran numbers, too.

20:42.284 --> 20:45.287
A lot of time, a lot of numbers.

20:46.375 --> 20:49.335
How long were you alone for?

20:49.378 --> 20:50.684
I lost track.

20:50.727 --> 20:54.383
Four, five years?

20:54.427 --> 20:57.734
I used to talk to myself.

20:57.778 --> 21:00.694
Narrate the day.

21:00.737 --> 21:03.305
Just to hear words aloud,
you know?

21:03.349 --> 21:07.440
So you're out of practice
being with others,

21:07.483 --> 21:09.311
and respecting boundaries.

21:10.834 --> 21:13.794
Yeah, you could say that.

21:13.837 --> 21:15.274
I'm sorry.

21:17.798 --> 21:19.452
I understand.

21:21.932 --> 21:26.154
I have a trick to fall asleep.
Want to hear it?

21:26.197 --> 21:29.288
Sure.

21:29.331 --> 21:33.204
I list the digits
of the golden ratio.

21:33.248 --> 21:35.424
That's too easy.

21:35.468 --> 21:38.558
Fine, every third digit. Eight.

21:38.601 --> 21:39.733
Three.

21:39.776 --> 21:41.038
Eight.

21:41.082 --> 21:42.910
Nine.

21:42.953 --> 21:44.085
Four.

21:45.086 --> 21:46.740
Eight.

21:46.783 --> 21:48.219
Four.

21:49.220 --> 21:50.483
Six.

21:50.526 --> 21:52.006
Four.

22:04.410 --> 22:07.326
<i>It took a year, but eventually</i> <i>
we became friends.</i>

22:07.369 --> 22:10.590
Under Osyraa and the Chain,
we were all we had.

22:12.548 --> 22:14.071
I know something about that.

22:14.115 --> 22:15.899
I figured you might.

22:15.943 --> 22:19.338
Let's get the antimatter
and get out of here.

22:19.381 --> 22:20.730
How much further?

22:20.774 --> 22:22.906
It's just beyond the trees.

22:33.439 --> 22:36.180
Commander Detmer, how soon until
we reach the galactic barrier?

22:36.224 --> 22:38.095
Coming out of warp now, Captain.

22:56.200 --> 22:59.116
So that's the edge
of the galaxy.

22:59.160 --> 23:02.076
Is it wrong that I think
that's pretty damn cool?

23:02.119 --> 23:05.209
Frontiers are always cool,
Mr. Rhys.

23:05.253 --> 23:07.255
If only we could enjoy it.

23:08.474 --> 23:10.258
But we have a job to do.

23:10.301 --> 23:11.955
Double-check shield systems

23:11.999 --> 23:15.089
and run a multiphasic scan
on the barrier itself.

23:15.132 --> 23:16.873
I want to know
what we're heading into

23:16.917 --> 23:19.049
and how to get ourselves and
everyone out quickly and safely.

23:19.093 --> 23:21.443
Let's get to it.
Aye, Captain.

23:29.146 --> 23:31.279
- Status report?
- Shields are ready, Captain.

23:31.322 --> 23:32.933
All other systems are nominal.

23:32.976 --> 23:35.762
- Mr. Saru?
- Well, unfortunately,

23:35.805 --> 23:38.417
scans show that the density
of negative particles

23:38.460 --> 23:42.333
in this sector are significantly
higher than predicted.

23:42.377 --> 23:45.162
- Meaning what?
- Our shields may not hold as long as expected,

23:45.206 --> 23:47.513
even with
the antimatter upgrades.

23:47.556 --> 23:49.515
- Commander Stamets.
- Already on it, Captain.

23:49.558 --> 23:51.038
And when this is all over,

23:51.081 --> 23:53.040
you should thank Heisenberg
instead of us.

23:53.083 --> 23:55.346
Noted. What's your suggestion?

23:55.390 --> 23:59.089
Vacuum-state fluctuations
are creating discrete bubbles

23:59.133 --> 24:00.700
<i>of protected space</i> <i>
that pass through</i>

24:00.743 --> 24:03.006
<i>the galactic barrier</i> <i>
at random intervals.</i>

24:03.050 --> 24:05.879
Spacial cells,
for lack of a better term.

24:05.922 --> 24:09.491
If we can position <i>Discovery</i>
inside of one,

24:09.535 --> 24:11.101
<i>we should be able</i> <i>
to safely ride it</i>

24:11.145 --> 24:12.581
<i>through to the other side</i> <i>
of the barrier.</i>

24:12.625 --> 24:14.235
Okay, but I don't see
a lot of consistency

24:14.278 --> 24:15.802
<i>amongst the spacial cells.</i>

24:15.845 --> 24:18.500
Neither do we, Captain.
95% are too unstable.

24:18.544 --> 24:21.198
Yeah, those are the ones
that are showing up gray scale.

24:21.242 --> 24:24.332
<i>Negative energy isn't allowing</i> <i>
them to reach equilibrium</i>

24:24.375 --> 24:26.769
<i>and settle into</i> <i>
a fixed spectrum emission.</i>

24:26.813 --> 24:29.468
So the colorful ones
are our best bet.

24:29.511 --> 24:31.252
<i>Yeah, should be.</i>

24:31.295 --> 24:32.906
<i>Zora found one nearby</i> <i>
that's forming right now.</i>

24:32.949 --> 24:34.342
<i>Sending the coordinates.</i>

24:34.385 --> 24:36.083
Commander Detmer, plot a course.

24:36.126 --> 24:37.650
Let's get through the barrier
as fast as we can.

24:37.693 --> 24:39.434
It'll be bumpy.

24:39.478 --> 24:42.002
Red alert.

24:53.709 --> 24:56.669
We're inside the barrier.

24:59.933 --> 25:02.413
You may notice a shift
in your visible spectra.

25:02.457 --> 25:03.632
No kidding.

25:03.676 --> 25:04.677
It will return to normal

25:04.720 --> 25:05.808
once we reach a cell

25:05.852 --> 25:06.983
that is in equilibrium.

25:07.027 --> 25:08.724
Closing in on the spacial cell.

25:09.725 --> 25:11.597
Shields dropping to 85%.

25:11.640 --> 25:14.687
- 75%.
- Mr. Saru?

25:14.730 --> 25:16.253
The cell is not yet large
enough to hold us, Captain.

25:16.297 --> 25:18.604
- How much longer?
- Approximately 20 seconds.

25:18.647 --> 25:21.258
Sensors show gamma rays
from a radioactive burst

25:21.302 --> 25:24.174
incoming in four seconds,
six degrees off port.

25:24.218 --> 25:25.349
Adjusting course!

25:27.351 --> 25:30.616
Shields down to 45%. 35.

25:30.659 --> 25:33.662
Stand by, Commander Detmer.
Spacial cell ready in three,

25:33.706 --> 25:35.316
two, one.

25:35.359 --> 25:36.796
- Now.
- Take us in.

25:36.839 --> 25:38.145
Aye, Captain.

25:45.979 --> 25:47.502
Holding steady.

25:47.546 --> 25:48.851
Ah.
- Good work.

25:48.895 --> 25:51.419
Maintain position.

25:51.462 --> 25:53.160
Let's get shields repaired.

25:53.203 --> 25:55.292
Let's keep an eye
on cell stability in here.

25:55.336 --> 25:56.903
Captain? A word.

25:56.946 --> 25:59.209
This is not an ideal time,
Madam President.

25:59.253 --> 26:01.734
I received a classified message
as we entered the barrier.

26:01.777 --> 26:05.389
Marked urgent, our eyes only.
It's being decrypted now.

26:12.440 --> 26:13.615
You good?

26:13.659 --> 26:15.225
Yeah.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.626
It's a ship. You said
this place was abandoned.

26:24.670 --> 26:25.888
It was.

26:25.932 --> 26:27.803
Whoever it is, they're cloaked.

26:29.849 --> 26:32.547
It's a courier model.
Must be here to scavenge.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.984
And if they're flying that low,
it's not the first time.

26:35.028 --> 26:36.638
What if they found
the antimatter?

26:36.682 --> 26:38.466
It was hidden
the last time I checked.

26:38.509 --> 26:40.294
When was that?

26:40.337 --> 26:42.122
I come here every year.

26:42.165 --> 26:43.384
Why?

26:45.081 --> 26:47.083
One.
Two.

26:47.127 --> 26:48.563
- Six.
- Three.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.652
Six.

26:50.696 --> 26:53.046
No. Damn it. Two.

26:53.089 --> 26:54.961
That one always trips me up.

26:56.527 --> 26:58.660
For someone who says
he's not hard on himself,

26:58.704 --> 27:00.227
you're pretty hard on yourself.

27:04.013 --> 27:05.624
No.

27:05.667 --> 27:09.062
No. No. No.

27:09.105 --> 27:11.586
It's okay. It's just someone
probably trying to escape.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.066
The last time...

27:14.850 --> 27:16.460
...the other engineer with me...

27:16.504 --> 27:18.680
- It'll be over soon.
- His head.

27:18.724 --> 27:20.377
His head.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.859
Hey, hey.

27:23.903 --> 27:25.513
It's all right. Okay?

27:28.908 --> 27:30.213
It's all right.

27:37.699 --> 27:39.875
See?

27:39.919 --> 27:41.398
It's done.

27:43.357 --> 27:45.228
You're okay.

27:59.547 --> 28:01.592
Why did you...

28:06.293 --> 28:08.687
You didn't have to do that.

28:14.736 --> 28:17.608
I never had
a real friend before.

28:23.440 --> 28:26.182
You were right, you know.

28:26.226 --> 28:28.707
About what?

28:28.750 --> 28:31.274
About the equations.

28:31.318 --> 28:34.669
The variable is
for multiverse positioning.

28:37.541 --> 28:39.805
I have a way out of here.

28:39.848 --> 28:42.068
There is no way out of here.

28:42.111 --> 28:43.547
Not with this.

28:46.420 --> 28:48.378
True.

28:48.422 --> 28:53.906
If one is traveling
within this universe.

28:55.298 --> 28:58.214
You're working on
an interdimensional transporter?

28:58.258 --> 29:00.782
I've been designing it
for years.

29:00.826 --> 29:03.524
But the power required
to successfully target

29:03.567 --> 29:05.265
a specific universe, that's...

29:05.308 --> 29:09.399
This camp runs off of a massive
geothermal energy source.

29:09.443 --> 29:12.794
Combined with power from the
warp core that we're building,

29:12.838 --> 29:14.578
it could be enough.

29:14.622 --> 29:16.798
Where would you go?

29:16.842 --> 29:18.321
Kayalise.

29:20.280 --> 29:24.588
It means something
like... "home."

29:27.330 --> 29:28.723
My people say that Kayalise

29:28.767 --> 29:31.552
is a place beyond suffering.

29:31.595 --> 29:34.816
It's long been part
of our cultural history.

29:34.860 --> 29:37.863
And out of all of
the possible universes,

29:37.906 --> 29:41.083
it is said to be
the most peaceful.

29:41.127 --> 29:44.608
I've been searching
for it for years,

29:44.652 --> 29:48.656
and my calculations prove
that it's real.

29:48.699 --> 29:51.398
That sounds like paradise.

29:51.441 --> 29:54.270
You could come with me.

29:56.229 --> 29:58.361
If you want.

30:03.279 --> 30:06.456
Come on.
Let's get this over with.

30:07.675 --> 30:11.331
President Rillak,
Captain Burnham.

30:11.374 --> 30:15.117
I hope this reaches you before
you move out of comms range.

30:15.161 --> 30:17.293
I'm sorry to report that the DMA

30:17.337 --> 30:20.557
has just moved to a new
harvesting location

30:20.601 --> 30:22.472
in the Alpha Quadrant.

30:22.516 --> 30:24.692
I've attached all data
that we have.

30:24.735 --> 30:26.694
Based on its current trajectory,

30:26.737 --> 30:29.131
we expect debris hit
by the gravitational wave

30:29.175 --> 30:31.046
to begin impacting
Ni'Var and Earth

30:31.090 --> 30:32.569
in the next few days.

30:32.613 --> 30:35.181
71 hours by our best estimation.

30:35.224 --> 30:37.531
I'm sending ships
to evacuate, but...

30:37.574 --> 30:40.142
Zora? Can you restore the rest? <i>
I'm sorry, Captain,</i>

30:40.186 --> 30:42.623
<i>it's damaged beyond repair.</i>

30:42.666 --> 30:43.885
We need to go back.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.756
We can't afford to do that.
Not now.

30:45.800 --> 30:49.108
We have to stay the course.
We have to get to the Ten-C.

30:49.151 --> 30:50.936
- I need to tell my crew.
- No.

30:50.979 --> 30:53.286
No. News like this will spread
faster than we can control.

30:53.329 --> 30:56.071
This-this has to remain
classified until...

30:56.115 --> 30:57.638
Telling them is my prerogative.

30:57.681 --> 31:00.336
Assembling this delegation
was delicate work.

31:00.380 --> 31:02.773
Earth is home
for so many of my crew.

31:02.817 --> 31:05.776
They deserve to know.

31:05.820 --> 31:08.605
<i>
Captain, we need you</i> <i>
on the bridge immediately.</i>

31:13.219 --> 31:15.786
We have stopped moving.

31:15.830 --> 31:19.529
Our spacial cell has drifted
into a cluster of 42 others.

31:19.573 --> 31:21.314
It's like a traffic jam.

31:21.357 --> 31:23.533
What can we do here?
Not much.

31:23.577 --> 31:26.145
I can't control the trajectory
of the cell we're in.

31:26.188 --> 31:27.668
How long will this take
to clear?

31:27.711 --> 31:31.411
It could be moments,
hours or weeks.

31:31.454 --> 31:34.675
In the meantime, it would seem
we have no choice but to wait.

31:44.337 --> 31:46.034
<i>
Commander Stamets,</i> <i>
have you found a way</i>

31:46.078 --> 31:48.210
<i>to get us moving yet?</i> <i>
I think so.</i>

31:48.254 --> 31:49.690
<i>Another cell's forming.</i>

31:49.733 --> 31:51.735
<i>Pretty far away,</i> <i>
but it's near a current.</i>

31:51.779 --> 31:53.999
<i>If we can get there, we can</i> <i>
ride it out of the barrier.</i>

31:54.042 --> 31:56.131
<i>We'll be out in no time.</i>

31:56.175 --> 31:58.133
<i>The faster the better,</i> <i>
Commander.</i>

31:58.177 --> 31:59.439
<i>Captain, I don't think</i> <i>
shields will hold long enough</i>

31:59.482 --> 32:00.483
<i>to get there.</i>

32:00.527 --> 32:01.615
No, no, no, no. They might.

32:01.658 --> 32:03.138
Yeah, i-if we...

32:03.182 --> 32:05.924
if we use the cells
that are blocking us

32:05.967 --> 32:08.883
and then move quickly through
them before they collapse.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.754
Moving through the unstable
cells will expose us

32:10.798 --> 32:12.234
to negative energy
and a lot of it.

32:12.278 --> 32:13.670
How long will our shields hold?

32:13.714 --> 32:15.629
Maybe five minutes,
at this point.

32:15.672 --> 32:17.805
Five minutes? Captain.

32:17.848 --> 32:19.415
We don't have any other options.

32:19.459 --> 32:23.115
Engineering, can you do anything
to buy us more time?

32:23.158 --> 32:26.031
Well, if, uh,
we continually recalibrate

32:26.074 --> 32:27.554
to counter the fluctuating...

32:27.597 --> 32:28.903
Will it work, Commander?

32:28.947 --> 32:30.209
<i>I'm...</i>

32:30.252 --> 32:31.819
cautiously optimistic.

32:31.862 --> 32:32.907
Ish.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.082
That'll have to do.

32:34.126 --> 32:35.344
Commander Detmer,
plot us a course.

32:35.388 --> 32:36.693
Aye, Captain.

32:36.737 --> 32:38.957
Leaving our spatial cell now.

32:41.655 --> 32:43.222
This is where you were held?

32:43.265 --> 32:45.311
Home for nearly two years
in the end.

32:46.312 --> 32:49.968
The programmable antimatter
used to be in the cabinets.

32:53.319 --> 32:56.017
Should be more than enough
for our shields.

33:26.352 --> 33:27.918
There's nothing in here.

33:30.617 --> 33:33.576
There's a spot behind the wall,
under the sand.

33:33.620 --> 33:35.926
We stole our own stash.
We hid it there.

33:35.970 --> 33:38.668
- To use in the transporter.
- Yeah.

33:41.628 --> 33:43.021
You never finished it?

33:43.064 --> 33:44.326
No, we did.

33:44.370 --> 33:46.720
Had to use it sooner
than expected.

33:46.763 --> 33:49.418
The Chain was planning
to shut down the camp.

33:54.336 --> 33:56.512
This was our only chance.

34:15.662 --> 34:17.055
Oros.

34:18.839 --> 34:20.841
It's a masterpiece.

34:22.364 --> 34:25.411
Couldn't have done this
without you.

34:25.454 --> 34:26.890
You know that.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.243
Do you think
we have enough power?

34:31.286 --> 34:33.158
We're drawing
from the entire warp core.

34:33.201 --> 34:34.681
It'll work.

34:40.904 --> 34:42.297
Ready?

34:42.341 --> 34:43.951
Yeah.

34:54.179 --> 34:57.095
Let's go home.

34:59.358 --> 35:01.273
No.

35:02.535 --> 35:03.797
No!

35:05.146 --> 35:06.278
Needs more energy.

35:14.547 --> 35:15.939
<i>
What happened after that?</i>

35:16.940 --> 35:18.507
You were right.

35:19.552 --> 35:22.120
I was the worst kind of asshole.

35:24.905 --> 35:26.950
I get it, you know.

35:28.561 --> 35:30.954
Looking back can be hard.

35:32.173 --> 35:33.783
For years,

35:33.827 --> 35:36.699
I blamed my father
for negotiating with the Chain.

35:38.048 --> 35:40.181
But I realized
maybe it was easier to blame him

35:40.225 --> 35:42.879
than to face the fact
that, ultimately...

35:44.229 --> 35:46.448
...he was powerless
to stop them.

35:47.797 --> 35:49.843
And he knew it.

35:57.546 --> 36:00.462
That's part of what drives me,
I think.

36:01.550 --> 36:04.205
Refusing to be powerless
like that.

36:04.249 --> 36:06.381
Look, whatever happened here
with Oros,

36:06.425 --> 36:08.078
it drives you.

36:08.122 --> 36:11.560
And if we're going outside
of the galaxy together,

36:11.604 --> 36:14.563
I need to know
who I'm dealing with.

36:20.482 --> 36:22.092
Get the shuttle ready.

36:22.136 --> 36:24.269
We're taking Oros with us. No.

36:24.312 --> 36:26.053
You're lucky
I haven't shot you yet.

36:26.096 --> 36:27.446
You told us
his transporter wouldn't work.

36:27.489 --> 36:29.056
You said it never would.

36:29.099 --> 36:30.884
No, stop. Please.

36:30.927 --> 36:32.277
Tarka?
Yeah.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.930
We knew
you were working on something.

36:33.974 --> 36:37.151
Said we'd let him go
if he found out what it was.

36:37.195 --> 36:38.239
Osyraa hates liars.

36:53.646 --> 36:55.474
I'm so sorry.

36:55.517 --> 36:57.737
I didn't know you back then.

36:57.780 --> 36:59.782
I'm gonna get us out of here.

37:01.393 --> 37:04.047
What are... what are you doing?

37:05.135 --> 37:06.441
No!

37:17.713 --> 37:19.280
Okay, hold still.

37:36.776 --> 37:38.256
Oh.

37:38.299 --> 37:41.259
We're free.

37:42.999 --> 37:44.436
Come on. Let's go.

37:45.828 --> 37:48.396
Let's go.

37:48.440 --> 37:49.876
<i>
All guards</i>

37:49.919 --> 37:51.181
<i>- assigned to Lab 4...</i>
- Come on. Please.

37:51.225 --> 37:52.444
We got to go.
We have to go now.

37:52.487 --> 37:54.010
The golden ratio, okay?

37:54.054 --> 37:55.838
- My ribs.
- Every three digits. Eight,

37:55.882 --> 37:57.579
- three-- It's okay.
- I think they're broken. I'm gonna

37:57.623 --> 37:59.277
- slow you down too much.
- I can carry you. I can carry you.

37:59.320 --> 38:00.278
It's okay.

38:05.326 --> 38:07.981
I forgive you.

38:09.722 --> 38:11.289
I don't deserve that.

38:11.332 --> 38:15.075
I... I would have done anything
for freedom.

38:17.033 --> 38:19.253
I will fix the transporter.

38:19.297 --> 38:20.602
I will find another way.

38:20.646 --> 38:22.822
We will go to Kayalise together.

38:24.911 --> 38:27.043
I believe it.

38:27.087 --> 38:29.872
But you must leave now.

38:30.830 --> 38:32.222
Please.

38:32.266 --> 38:34.790
I'll come back for you.

38:34.834 --> 38:36.226
I promise.

38:45.540 --> 38:47.847
<i>
I hid in a cave for a week,</i>

38:47.890 --> 38:49.675
trying to find a way back in.

38:51.024 --> 38:54.593
One day, there was this massive
power surge at the camp.

38:55.594 --> 38:57.465
I heard ships leaving.

38:57.509 --> 38:59.902
I went back.
The place was deserted.

38:59.946 --> 39:01.991
Oros was gone.

39:02.992 --> 39:04.385
But I found this.

39:06.256 --> 39:08.389
The golden ratio.

39:08.433 --> 39:10.652
His message to me.

39:13.133 --> 39:16.354
It was our symbol for Kayalise.

39:16.397 --> 39:17.877
Home.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.922
You think he made it.

39:19.966 --> 39:22.098
He's brilliant.

39:22.142 --> 39:24.753
If anyone can do it, it's him.

39:27.060 --> 39:29.758
I've never found
any record of Oros since,

39:29.802 --> 39:31.281
alive or dead.

39:31.325 --> 39:32.544
Nothing.

39:32.587 --> 39:34.894
That's why you come here
every year.

39:35.982 --> 39:38.114
Looking for another sign.

39:38.158 --> 39:40.813
Statistically,
anything's possible.

39:42.597 --> 39:45.252
So I built my own transporter.

39:46.253 --> 39:48.560
But trying to find
the power to make it work,

39:48.603 --> 39:50.388
it's taken years.

39:50.431 --> 39:53.782
And the DMA's power source
should have more than enough.

39:53.826 --> 39:55.871
So that's it.

39:57.307 --> 39:59.266
That's who you're dealing with.

40:12.279 --> 40:14.542
<i>
We just lost one</i> <i>
of our forward emitters.</i>

40:14.586 --> 40:17.545
<i>Ensign Tal?</i> <i>
- Making repairs now, Captain.</i>

40:17.589 --> 40:18.677
Commander Detmer,
how much longer

40:18.720 --> 40:19.939
until we reach the target cell?

40:19.982 --> 40:21.984
It's dead ahead.
Few more minutes.

40:22.028 --> 40:24.204
Once we arrive, the new
spacial cell should carry us out

40:24.247 --> 40:25.945
of the galactic barrier
within the hour.

40:25.988 --> 40:28.991
We will then be able to proceed
to first contact.

40:29.035 --> 40:31.341
Commander Owosekun,
how are we doing on shields?

40:31.385 --> 40:33.735
- Down to four percent!
- Engineering?

40:33.779 --> 40:35.694
<i>
We might be able to buy</i> <i>
another 30 seconds,</i>

40:35.737 --> 40:37.130
<i>but that's it.</i>

40:37.173 --> 40:39.045
It's not enough.
- Hey.

40:39.088 --> 40:40.960
We've got this.
A month from now,

40:41.003 --> 40:42.875
you'll be back skiing
in Zermatt.

40:42.918 --> 40:44.485
And where you gonna go?

40:44.529 --> 40:46.095
Astoria.

40:46.139 --> 40:47.749
On Earth's Oregon Coast.

40:47.793 --> 40:48.924
It's heaven.

40:48.968 --> 40:50.970
Hawaii, for me. The beach.

40:51.013 --> 40:53.102
A mai tai.
Maybe I'll take up snorkeling.

40:53.146 --> 40:54.452
Great, I'm coming with you.

40:54.495 --> 40:56.149
I'm gonna hike
the Pacific Crest Trail.

40:56.192 --> 40:58.020
I've locked onto
the target cell, Captain!

40:58.064 --> 41:01.371
Stamets, we'll need those
30 seconds on shields right now!

41:01.415 --> 41:03.373
<i>I'll do my best not to kill us.</i>

41:03.417 --> 41:04.766
Always appreciated.

41:04.810 --> 41:06.768
Owosekun, track our time.

41:06.812 --> 41:07.987
Detmer, on your mark.

41:08.030 --> 41:09.205
Aye, Captain.

41:09.249 --> 41:10.468
Here we go!

41:24.786 --> 41:26.353
15 seconds!

41:26.396 --> 41:27.920
Fourteen.

41:27.963 --> 41:29.269
Thirteen.

41:29.312 --> 41:30.575
Twelve.

41:30.618 --> 41:32.011
Eleven.

41:32.054 --> 41:33.447
Ten.

41:33.491 --> 41:34.579
Nine.

41:34.622 --> 41:37.538
Eight. Sev--

41:38.583 --> 41:40.715
We're in.

41:40.759 --> 41:42.325
Six seconds to spare.

41:44.502 --> 41:46.286
Nothing like cutting it close,
huh?

41:47.505 --> 41:48.549
Great work, Detmer.

41:48.593 --> 41:50.203
Great job, everyone.

41:50.246 --> 41:53.032
Mr. Saru,
let's get a team on repairs.

41:53.075 --> 41:54.294
You have the conn.

41:54.337 --> 41:56.078
Madam President.

41:57.123 --> 41:58.516
A word?

41:59.908 --> 42:01.562
<i>
Well done, Commander.</i>

42:01.606 --> 42:03.390
You, too, Zora.
I don't know.

42:03.433 --> 42:05.479
You were cutting it
pretty close.

42:05.523 --> 42:07.220
I like living on the edge.

42:07.263 --> 42:08.308
Okay.

42:11.137 --> 42:12.704
Hey. Um...

42:13.922 --> 42:17.926
About earlier,
with the captain, um,

42:17.970 --> 42:20.538
I might have been a little...

42:20.581 --> 42:22.409
enthusiastic.

42:22.452 --> 42:24.106
Yes. I...

42:24.150 --> 42:26.152
I did think
that I might lose my lunch.

42:26.195 --> 42:28.110
And I had curry, so...

42:28.154 --> 42:30.330
It's just-- I, um...

42:30.373 --> 42:33.159
I know how hard
it's been for you,

42:33.202 --> 42:34.813
being apart from Gray.

42:34.856 --> 42:36.249
I was...

42:36.292 --> 42:37.685
trying to help.

42:37.729 --> 42:39.426
I know.

42:41.602 --> 42:45.301
I've-I've been all right, actually.

42:45.345 --> 42:48.566
I mean, it's different,
but it's not...

42:48.609 --> 42:50.785
bad-different.

42:52.091 --> 42:55.834
I-I get to tell Gray
about all this when I see him.

42:55.877 --> 42:57.618
You know?

42:57.662 --> 42:59.794
And we're, like,
leaving the galaxy.

42:59.838 --> 43:01.491
So...

43:01.535 --> 43:04.059
Yeah. I, um...

43:04.103 --> 43:06.714
I probably worry a bit too much.

43:08.760 --> 43:11.980
Fair warning, but, um...

43:12.024 --> 43:15.984
I will always reach for you
if it seems you're hurting.

43:16.028 --> 43:19.205
My dad never did that for me.

43:19.248 --> 43:21.250
So, uh...

43:21.294 --> 43:25.428
I might do it a little extra
for you.

43:27.126 --> 43:28.823
Okay.

43:28.867 --> 43:30.912
I have been warned.

43:33.262 --> 43:35.787
I, too, was moved by hearing
what Earth means to them,

43:35.830 --> 43:37.789
but it does not change my belief

43:37.832 --> 43:40.618
that this information
cannot be shared yet.

43:40.661 --> 43:43.621
With respect, I think
something else is going on here.

43:43.664 --> 43:44.796
For both of us.

43:44.839 --> 43:46.275
What do you mean?

43:46.319 --> 43:49.322
Right now,
we can control who knows what.

43:50.323 --> 43:51.890
And not much else.

43:51.933 --> 43:53.761
Mm.

43:53.805 --> 43:55.154
It's a hard place to be.

43:58.287 --> 44:00.638
Earth and Ni'Var are
the only homes I've ever known.

44:00.681 --> 44:04.206
And what I am right now
is angry.

44:05.555 --> 44:07.906
I am angry at this situation.

44:08.907 --> 44:10.386
I'm angry at the DMA creators,

44:10.430 --> 44:11.997
whoever they may be.

44:12.040 --> 44:13.563
I'm angry at Book.

44:13.607 --> 44:16.741
And at the possibility
that we, uh...

44:18.394 --> 44:20.701
...we could fail.

44:20.745 --> 44:22.921
Your mother,

44:22.964 --> 44:25.271
she hasn't returned
to Ni'Var yet, has she?

44:25.314 --> 44:27.447
No.

44:27.490 --> 44:30.668
No, thankfully, she's
still with J'Vini on P'Jahr.

44:32.278 --> 44:34.672
My mother's family is on Earth.

44:36.891 --> 44:39.372
And my partner just started
a new research project

44:39.415 --> 44:41.548
on Earth's moon.

44:41.591 --> 44:43.855
I had no idea.

44:43.898 --> 44:45.595
I wish you had said something.

44:46.945 --> 44:49.382
Putting words to it
won't help him.

44:50.339 --> 44:51.950
But it might help you.

44:51.993 --> 44:55.388
We're all we have out here,
Madam President.

44:55.431 --> 44:58.434
We have to support each other.

44:59.827 --> 45:03.309
That's what this crew has done
in the darkest of times.

45:03.352 --> 45:05.920
But to do that takes honesty.

45:05.964 --> 45:07.922
With ourselves
and with everyone.

45:13.623 --> 45:15.887
Let me know where you land.

45:23.721 --> 45:25.810
I applied
the programmable antimatter

45:25.853 --> 45:27.812
to the shield generator.

45:27.855 --> 45:29.509
We're ready to go.

45:32.251 --> 45:35.689
You shouldn't blame yourself
for leaving him behind.

45:35.733 --> 45:38.387
There's not a day goes by
that I don't.

45:40.346 --> 45:42.870
I hope he's out there

45:42.914 --> 45:45.568
and you get to see him again.

45:45.612 --> 45:49.877
Along the way, we'll stop the
DMA and save billions of lives.

45:50.878 --> 45:53.054
That's the definition
of a win-win.

45:54.012 --> 45:55.491
I'll take it.

45:57.058 --> 45:59.887
Now let's get through
the damn barrier.

45:59.931 --> 46:02.455
Captain, I couldn't be happier
to report

46:02.498 --> 46:04.457
<i>that we're officially out</i> <i>
of the galactic barrier.</i>

46:04.500 --> 46:05.937
Out of the Milky Way

46:05.980 --> 46:08.156
and into extragalactic space.

46:10.028 --> 46:11.812
Well done.

46:11.856 --> 46:13.640
All of you.

46:13.683 --> 46:16.251
It's weird to see so few stars.

46:16.295 --> 46:19.124
Space has never felt this... empty.

46:19.167 --> 46:20.516
Or quiet.

46:20.560 --> 46:23.345
Not many people
have gotten to see this.

46:23.389 --> 46:25.130
Well, Captain,
should I set a course

46:25.173 --> 46:26.522
for the Ten-C?

46:26.566 --> 46:29.351
We should address
the ship first.

46:32.572 --> 46:34.443
Lieutenant Christopher,
open a channel.

46:34.487 --> 46:36.489
Channel's open.

46:37.490 --> 46:39.492
Madam President.

46:42.364 --> 46:44.671
<i>Discovery</i> crew,

46:44.714 --> 46:46.978
esteemed delegates,

46:47.021 --> 46:49.328
we have faced and met

46:49.371 --> 46:52.244
our first challenge
of this mission.

46:52.287 --> 46:53.549
Thank you.

46:54.550 --> 46:55.725
For your bravery,

46:55.769 --> 46:57.989
your focus, your strength.

47:01.383 --> 47:05.692
Unfortunately, I have
some difficult news to share.

47:05.735 --> 47:09.391
We have received word
that the DMA has moved.

47:09.435 --> 47:11.437
It is now days away

47:11.480 --> 47:14.005
from Ni'Var, Titan

47:14.048 --> 47:15.920
and Earth.

47:16.921 --> 47:18.879
<i>To the many on board</i>

47:18.923 --> 47:21.534
<i>with family, friends</i> <i>
and colleagues</i>

47:21.577 --> 47:24.319
<i>now under direct threat,</i> <i>
I, too,</i>

47:24.363 --> 47:27.279
<i>feel your pain</i> <i>
in this moment...</i>

47:52.826 --> 47:55.046
Madam President.

47:56.090 --> 47:58.876
I am so deeply sorry
for this news.

48:02.618 --> 48:05.578
Could you sit with me a while?

48:05.621 --> 48:08.146
I would appreciate your company.

48:09.277 --> 48:11.976
I find you a...

48:12.019 --> 48:14.413
comforting presence.

48:16.894 --> 48:18.243
Of course.

48:25.772 --> 48:28.383
So that's the hyperfield.

48:28.427 --> 48:30.820
As much as our long-range scans
can show us.

48:30.864 --> 48:34.999
I think I... preferred it
as a blob of radio waves.

48:35.042 --> 48:36.087
Yeah.

48:37.436 --> 48:41.353
There is a planet about
two light-years away from it.

48:41.396 --> 48:43.485
Initial scans don't show
any signs of life.

48:43.529 --> 48:45.661
But given its proximity,
I'm having a team check it out

48:45.705 --> 48:47.011
to see if there's anything there

48:47.054 --> 48:48.403
that can help us
with first contact.

48:49.927 --> 48:52.233
Good idea.

49:00.067 --> 49:02.026
Thank you for sharing the news.

49:04.332 --> 49:07.031
We could have told them together.

49:08.858 --> 49:10.991
Why did you want me to do it?

49:11.035 --> 49:13.602
In times of crisis,
people need to know

49:13.646 --> 49:15.865
that their leaders
are not rattled by uncertainty

49:15.909 --> 49:17.693
or overwhelming odds.

49:19.478 --> 49:22.089
They need to know
that there is a plan.

49:23.569 --> 49:26.441
That they'll be okay.

49:26.485 --> 49:28.356
You're their president.

49:28.400 --> 49:31.011
You can give them confidence.

49:31.055 --> 49:33.622
A sense of security.

49:35.276 --> 49:37.583
You're my president, too.

49:39.063 --> 49:40.716
Oh...

49:40.760 --> 49:43.893
I'm grateful...

49:43.937 --> 49:47.027
we had the chance to...

49:47.071 --> 49:48.898
connect

49:48.942 --> 49:51.466
before we approach
Species Ten-C.

49:51.510 --> 49:53.077
If we can't communicate
with each other,

49:53.120 --> 49:55.296
what chance
do we have with them?

49:58.082 --> 49:59.822
Hmm.

50:00.954 --> 50:04.088
What do you think we'll find
when we get to the hyperfield?

50:05.089 --> 50:07.047
I have no idea.

50:07.091 --> 50:08.875
But we have to succeed.

50:08.918 --> 50:10.268
We have to.
