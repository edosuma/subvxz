CHARLIE:
What if we let off
some fireworks in here, huh?

00:06.173 --> 00:07.574
DENNIS:
Fireworks in the bar?

00:07.608 --> 00:08.642
It's never been done
before. Right?

00:08.675 --> 00:10.177
That could be
kind of good, right?

00:10.210 --> 00:12.212
You'll burn the place
to the ground.

00:12.246 --> 00:13.647
But Charlie is right, though.
Like, we have to have

00:13.680 --> 00:15.282
‐some kind of flair
for this business meeting.
‐Yeah.

00:15.315 --> 00:16.750
This guy's
a huge potential investor.

00:16.783 --> 00:18.352
He could give Paddy's
tons of money.

00:18.385 --> 00:20.187
I know, we need pageantry.
We need, uh‐‐

00:20.220 --> 00:21.221
Oh, dude, I just thought
of something.

00:21.255 --> 00:23.090
What if it's not a guy?
What if it's a woman?

00:23.123 --> 00:25.192
If‐if it's a woman,
I got flowers prepped for her.

00:25.225 --> 00:26.727
‐Okay.
‐Oh.

00:26.760 --> 00:30.330
And if it's a guy,
I got a football ready for him.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.732
‐Nice. Okay, that's good.
‐No, well‐‐ No.

00:31.765 --> 00:34.134
Hold on. What if it's a guy
who hates football

00:34.168 --> 00:36.136
‐but loves flowers?
‐Right, right, right.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.272
‐Or a woman who loves football
but hates flowers?
‐Hates flowers.

00:38.305 --> 00:39.406
MAC:
Or a woman who was assigned

00:39.439 --> 00:41.608
male gender at birth

00:41.642 --> 00:44.244
‐but has retained her
traditional love of the game?
‐Yes.

00:44.278 --> 00:46.280
Which she has the right to do.

00:46.313 --> 00:48.515
‐That is her right...
‐Of course, it's 2021...
‐DEE: That's fine. Yeah.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.751
Here's the bottom line,
you guys: it's 2021,

00:50.784 --> 00:53.020
all bets are off, okay?

00:53.053 --> 00:54.655
‐Uh, the chances
of this person walking in...
‐(door opens)

00:54.688 --> 00:57.658
and being your typical vanilla
white guy are slim to none.

00:57.691 --> 01:00.360
Hi. Sorry to interrupt.
Uh, my‐my name's Gary.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.462
I'm here to speak to the owners
of Paddy's Pub.

01:02.496 --> 01:04.631
‐Uh‐‐ Oh.
‐Oh, thank sweet Jesus.
‐(laughs)

01:04.665 --> 01:06.700
‐All right!
‐Gary.
‐This is a relief.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.135
FRANK:
Gary.

01:08.168 --> 01:09.469
‐It is so good to see you.
‐(whoops)

01:09.503 --> 01:11.338
This I can wrap my head around.

01:11.371 --> 01:13.140
Uh, Gary,
we're gonna set up over here.

01:13.173 --> 01:14.474
‐All right. Yeah.
‐We'll take care of you.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.376
We got together,
we got you a little gift here,

01:16.410 --> 01:19.446
a token of our appreciation,
and, uh‐‐ from the pub.

01:19.479 --> 01:21.982
‐Yeah, that's from us
to you, so...
‐Yeah, from us to you. Uh...

01:24.751 --> 01:27.387
Oh, uh, thank you.

01:27.421 --> 01:30.224
(whoops)
All right. That's a relief.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.426
DENNIS:
All right, well, now that we all
know that we see eye to eye,

01:32.459 --> 01:35.162
let's talk about you
giving us that PPP loan, huh?

01:35.195 --> 01:37.464
Oh, I'm so sorry. Uh,
there must be some confusion.

01:37.498 --> 01:39.666
I'm not here to hand out
PPP loans.

01:39.700 --> 01:42.336
I'm here to collect on ones
you already have.

01:42.369 --> 01:45.205
Um, in fact, as I believe,
it's three separate loans,

01:45.239 --> 01:47.574
so I'll just need to know, uh,
what you did with the money

01:47.608 --> 01:50.744
and what the business has
been up to for the past year.

01:53.247 --> 01:55.215

various interests.

we're running a thriving bar

02:32.152 --> 02:33.353
‐DENNIS: Oh, yeah.
‐Yeah. But, uh, COVID forced us

02:33.387 --> 02:35.622
to close our doors
to the community, so...

02:35.656 --> 02:37.324
‐Yeah.
‐What were we gonna do?
‐We had to branch out.

02:37.357 --> 02:39.459
‐That's what we did.
‐So why don't we just, uh,

02:39.493 --> 02:42.563
talk about the first loan,
which is "Punch Incorporated"?

02:42.596 --> 02:44.698
‐(laughs): Yeah.
‐Oh, yeah. That was,
uh, that was Mac and I.

02:44.731 --> 02:46.767

‐Yeah.

That makes sense.

"Let me be your guy,

03:36.750 --> 03:38.252

to forget the flies

thinking about the election.

‐and‐and we need
to get involved.
‐Mm‐hmm.

04:11.285 --> 04:12.219
You know, we were
concerned that our guy

04:12.252 --> 04:14.354
wasn't gonna get
a fair shot in the election.

04:14.388 --> 04:15.556
MAC:
Of course not,
because he's an outsider

04:15.589 --> 04:17.024
that brings a fresh perspective

04:17.057 --> 04:18.225
to Washington. Right?

04:18.258 --> 04:19.493
‐Right.
‐I mean, we‐‐

04:19.526 --> 04:21.495
not everybody likes him,
but that's why we do.

04:21.528 --> 04:23.297
Yeah, and we were really worried
that the mainstream media

04:23.330 --> 04:25.265
just wasn't
taking him seriously.

04:25.299 --> 04:26.733
MAC:
It's like, do I want
a bunch of eggheads

04:26.767 --> 04:28.402
who spend all day
learning about shit

04:28.435 --> 04:30.571
influencing how I think
about things? No.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.040
No, no. Plus, you want a guy
who's lived a little, right?

04:33.073 --> 04:34.641
You want a guy
who knows how to party.

04:34.675 --> 04:37.377
‐And our guy knows
how to party. Right?
‐(laughter)

04:37.411 --> 04:40.047
‐Yeah.
‐Our guy parties.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.481
Anyway, it was obvious
that the integrity

04:41.515 --> 04:43.617
of the election
was at stake here.

04:43.650 --> 04:45.352
So that's why
we wanted to make sure

04:45.385 --> 04:47.187
that things went smoothly
at the polling place.

04:47.221 --> 04:49.356
‐Right.
‐Hence, we created
Punch Incorporated.

04:49.389 --> 04:52.326
So, we used the loan
to buy tactical gear.

04:52.359 --> 04:55.295
Oh. Look at this one,
with the New York hat.

04:55.329 --> 04:56.697
She got bussed in
from that liberal hellscape?

04:56.730 --> 04:58.465
All right, let's go find out.

04:58.499 --> 04:59.600
‐Let's talk to her.
Excuse me, ma'am?
‐Ma'am?

04:59.633 --> 05:01.235
‐Ma'am, yes. Hi.
‐Ma'am.

05:01.268 --> 05:02.636
‐Ma'am.
‐Are you, uh,
registered to vote here?

05:02.669 --> 05:03.770
‐Ma'am?
‐Are you from Philly?

05:03.804 --> 05:05.405
‐Huh?
‐Yeah, and we don't want to see

05:05.439 --> 05:06.607
‐any of that bogus
fake I. D. bullshit.
‐Yeah.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.042
We're gonna ask you a series
of Philly‐related questions

05:09.076 --> 05:10.010
‐in no particular order.
‐Mm‐hmm.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.745
Why do we hate Chris Chelios?

05:11.778 --> 05:14.281
Who is Uncle Eddie Savitz?

05:14.314 --> 05:17.484
Who is a better athlete,
Donovan McNabb or Rocky Balboa?

05:17.518 --> 05:19.319
‐Where is...?
‐Hey‐‐ Whoa.
Well, hold on a second.

05:19.353 --> 05:22.256
I mean, that's too easy.
McNabb, obviously.

05:22.289 --> 05:24.158
‐I...
‐Well, I don't think
it's that obvious.

05:24.191 --> 05:25.626
I mean, do you think
Donovan McNabb

05:25.659 --> 05:28.228
could go toe‐to‐toe
with Ivan Drago for 15 rounds?

05:28.262 --> 05:30.230
Uh, no, what I'm saying
is that Rocky Balboa

05:30.264 --> 05:31.999
is a fictional character, so
this isn't even a conversation.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.434
Are you‐‐ Are you saying
you want Sly Stallone

05:34.468 --> 05:36.670
to be the starting QB
for the Eagles next season?

05:36.703 --> 05:38.438
‐How do you think
that's gonna go?
‐Well, what year is it?

05:38.472 --> 05:41.375
Is it early 1980s? 'Cause
the NFC East was not strong,

05:41.408 --> 05:43.510
and I say that Sly
takes us to the playoffs.

05:43.544 --> 05:45.245
Sly Stallone is just
a meatball actor.

05:45.279 --> 05:46.380
Then why do we make statues
to him?

05:46.413 --> 05:47.447
We don't‐‐ Okay, hold on a sec.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.449
Wait, just... You're crazy.

05:49.483 --> 05:52.419
Okay, the guy is five‐foot‐nine,
okay, to start with‐‐

05:52.452 --> 05:53.654
And by the way,
that's a celebrity listing.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.455
He's probably closer
to five‐foot‐four.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.324
So was Doug Flutie.
You saying he's an actor?

05:57.357 --> 05:58.492
‐No, I'm say...
‐He's one of the greatest

05:58.525 --> 06:00.627
football players
that Canada ever produced.

06:00.661 --> 06:02.629
So‐so, I'm sorry,
now you're comparing McNabb

06:02.663 --> 06:04.331
to a teeny‐tiny little man

06:04.364 --> 06:06.366
who's, uh, named
after a woodwind instrument?

06:06.400 --> 06:07.668
‐What are we even
talking about, man?
‐Hey, what's up, Brian?

06:07.701 --> 06:09.303
‐Good to see you again.
‐Brian.

06:09.336 --> 06:11.605
What's going on?
Y‐You want us to, um...

06:11.638 --> 06:13.040
You want us back
at the hundred feet?

06:13.073 --> 06:14.508
He wants us back
at the hundred feet.

06:14.541 --> 06:15.442
We're gonna be less effective
back there, but...

06:15.475 --> 06:18.011
The problem is,
back there, we can't...

06:18.045 --> 06:19.613
‐we can't keep a‐‐ Yeah.
‐Okay. All right.

06:19.646 --> 06:21.048
‐We'll go back to the hundred.
‐Let's‐let's‐‐ We're gonna...

06:21.081 --> 06:23.217
Hey, you want to go‐‐
grab you a coffee?

06:23.250 --> 06:24.518
‐MAC: We got‐‐
We'll grab him a coffee.
‐We'll grab you a coffee,

06:24.551 --> 06:26.486
‐and then we'll be back, but...
‐Thanks for keeping things safe.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.521
‐We'll stay a little bit
further away.
‐We'll keep things safe.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.089
DENNIS:
Suffice to say, our arguing

06:29.122 --> 06:30.724
did not help the situation.

06:30.757 --> 06:32.759
Yeah, it turns out they had
their own security there

06:32.793 --> 06:35.195
‐to keep things safe, and
they just kicked us right out.
‐(chuckles)

06:35.229 --> 06:36.663
DENNIS:
Anyway, the point is,

06:36.697 --> 06:38.632
the country was in turmoil,
okay? Tensions were high,

06:38.665 --> 06:42.503
so Mac and I decided to pivot to
a less controversial approach.

06:42.536 --> 06:43.303

Yeah, we went
with gaining exposure

07:36.523 --> 07:37.724
about, like, what votes
were supposed to be counted

07:37.758 --> 07:39.660
and what votes
aren't gonna be counted.

07:39.693 --> 07:40.994
And are these legitimate votes,
are these not legitimate votes?

07:41.028 --> 07:42.396
What's this, what's that?

07:42.429 --> 07:44.565
I mean, we put our boxes
all over the damn place.

07:44.598 --> 07:47.267
So, you know, we created a mess.
(laughs)

07:47.301 --> 07:48.435
I'm sorry, let me, let me
try to get this straight.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.737
So you're saying that you might
be partially responsible

07:50.771 --> 07:53.740
for the voting count delays
in the presidential election?

07:53.774 --> 07:57.177
Uh, no, no, I'm saying we might
have been entirely responsible,

07:57.211 --> 07:59.680
uh, for the vote delays, but
wha‐what I'm also saying is that

07:59.713 --> 08:02.516
we were two American businessmen
who took out a legitimate loan

08:02.549 --> 08:04.051
for a legitimate business.

08:04.084 --> 08:05.285
Uh, well, now
that we've got that settled,

08:05.319 --> 08:06.787
uh, I'll tell you what,

08:06.820 --> 08:08.388
why don't, um,
why don't we play you

08:08.422 --> 08:10.290
a couple of our original songs,

08:10.324 --> 08:12.259
loosely based
on the chord progressions

08:12.292 --> 08:14.194
‐of Emerson, Lake & Palmer?
‐Mmm.

08:14.228 --> 08:15.629
‐N‐No.
‐Yes.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.164
‐No. I think we should just...
‐Yes.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.132
Actually, let's just
keep moving on

08:19.166 --> 08:20.100
to‐to the next loan,
if that's okay.

08:24.738 --> 08:27.174
Uh, so, uh,
"Frank's Imports and Exports."

08:27.207 --> 08:29.376
‐Oh, that's this guy.
I'm gonna get a beer.
‐Boom.

08:29.409 --> 08:31.578
Go. What do you want to know?

08:31.612 --> 08:32.746
Uh, what were you importing?

08:32.779 --> 08:35.115
Inks, grease, paste.

08:35.148 --> 08:36.650
Sludges in general.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.585
Sludges, I see. All right.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.053
And, uh, what were
you exporting?

08:40.087 --> 08:41.088
Hair dye.

08:43.423 --> 08:45.058
Frank, I'm worried
about you, man.

08:45.092 --> 08:47.094
You're hitting it
way too hard, pal.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.096
FRANK:
I was going hard.

08:49.129 --> 08:52.766
When society hits the brakes,
I hit the gas, baby.

08:52.799 --> 08:56.503
(slurring):
Society break, I got gas.

08:56.537 --> 08:59.439
What? If you have gas,
take it out in the hall, okay?

08:59.473 --> 09:01.341
Also, I need another bucket.
I'm out of paint here.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.177
‐Where...
‐I got no more buckets.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.111
Look, I shouldn't even
be doing this, man.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.646
Uh, y‐‐ It looks terrible.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.581
You should get this done in,
like, a salon or something.

09:07.614 --> 09:10.117
Salons are closed.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.752
I got to go, got to go,
got to go, got to go.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.353
‐Got to go? Where you going?
‐Yeah, I got to go.

09:13.387 --> 09:14.721
That's only half‐‐
You look crazy, dude.

09:14.755 --> 09:17.090
‐Where you going?
‐I'm out.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.593
What... Well,
take a mask, will you?

09:19.626 --> 09:22.429
‐I mean, you got one?
‐I got‐‐ Yes, I got a mask.

09:22.462 --> 09:24.331
‐You got to wear it,
though, Frank.
‐It's on. I got it on.

09:24.364 --> 09:26.300
Yeah, but you got
to cover your nose, dude.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.035
You got to...

09:28.068 --> 09:30.037
Why does nobody old
know how to wear a mask?

09:30.070 --> 09:32.573
FRANK:
I was sick of staying inside.

09:32.606 --> 09:34.775
So I went to my favorite
bookstore to clear my head.

09:34.808 --> 09:38.212
Fortunately, my favorite
bookstore never closes,

09:38.245 --> 09:40.447
and they never judge
their customers.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.316
Oh, hey, you got to wear a mask.

09:42.349 --> 09:45.052
I got a mask.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.320
‐Oh, I didn't see it.
‐Right.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.121
‐You're good.
‐Thank you.

09:48.155 --> 09:50.190
So I grabbed a few titles

09:50.224 --> 09:53.293
and I went in the back
to do some light reading.

09:53.327 --> 09:56.230
There I was,
staring at my idols,

09:56.263 --> 10:01.568
Peter North, T. T. Boy,
the late, great D. J. Ram.

10:01.602 --> 10:04.304
And that's when I noticed it.

10:04.338 --> 10:07.574
The bad dye job.
Who had I become?

10:07.608 --> 10:10.444
I was letting the pandemic
get the best of me.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.179
It had taken my manhood.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.247
Well, I went home

10:13.280 --> 10:16.183
and immediately
did something about it.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.352
After I popped off.

10:18.385 --> 10:22.589
I got right to work on creating
the perfect hair dye.

10:22.623 --> 10:25.325
Shoe polish, India ink,

10:25.359 --> 10:26.727
permanent marker.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.429
I tried 'em all.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.732
Until I finally hit pay dirt.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.567
Whoa.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.303
Chinese motor oil.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.071
‐Bingo.
‐Bingo.

10:38.105 --> 10:41.041
For the first time
in a long time,

10:41.074 --> 10:43.577
I felt like somebody again.

10:43.610 --> 10:45.779
I couldn't let this opportunity
go to waste.

10:45.812 --> 10:48.649
I opened a chair.

10:48.682 --> 10:52.786
I became the most sought‐after
underground hair stylist

10:52.819 --> 10:56.190
for like‐minded older men
yearning

10:56.223 --> 10:59.426
for a sense of community
during the pandemic.

10:59.459 --> 11:03.697
I had my PPP loan,
and business was booming.

11:05.265 --> 11:09.336
♪ Ooh, a storm is threatening ♪

11:09.369 --> 11:12.272

11:36.663 --> 11:38.732
FRANK:
Then one day,
this guy comes in.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.567
Not even the usual clientele.

11:40.601 --> 11:43.437
Didn't even look
at the magazines.

11:43.470 --> 11:46.306
Said he just needed
a place to cool off.

11:46.340 --> 11:48.242
Next thing you know,
he's in my chair.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.611
We talked about the election,

11:50.644 --> 11:55.048
and our mutual disdain
for insider Beltway politics.

11:55.082 --> 11:58.218
He wasn't from the neighborhood.

11:58.252 --> 12:00.621
Said he was in from New York,
doing some business

12:00.654 --> 12:04.158
at a fancy hotel
down the street.

12:04.191 --> 12:05.592
He said his boss
was a very connected man

12:05.626 --> 12:08.562
who needed a situation fixed.

12:08.595 --> 12:12.566
And this poor bastard was
in the eye of the shitstorm.

12:12.599 --> 12:15.435
I did him up real nice.

12:15.469 --> 12:18.071
Little did I know,
my work was about to be

12:18.105 --> 12:19.706
in the national spotlight,

12:19.740 --> 12:23.043
on the head of America's mayor,

12:23.076 --> 12:26.346
Rudolph William Giuliani.

12:26.380 --> 12:30.184
I was proud of how my work
stood up in the spotlight.

12:30.217 --> 12:32.653
He became my biggest client.

12:32.686 --> 12:35.122
Funny thing about
the spotlight, though,

12:35.155 --> 12:36.990
sometimes it burns too bright.

12:39.493 --> 12:43.230
And that was the moment I knew
it was coming to an end.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.599
It was my own fault.
I got sloppy.

12:45.632 --> 12:48.702
Started cutting corners,
using American motor oil.

12:48.735 --> 12:52.005
And to top it off,
my guy didn't win the election.

12:52.773 --> 12:55.042
The whole thing was a fiasco.

12:55.075 --> 12:57.644
I‐I blame myself.

12:57.678 --> 12:59.179
Wait, y‐‐ so you're saying
that the hair dye

12:59.213 --> 13:00.581
that's dripping down your face

13:00.614 --> 13:02.749
is the same dye
used by Rudolph Giuliani

13:02.783 --> 13:04.718
during the presidential
election?

13:04.751 --> 13:05.719
Yeah.

13:10.757 --> 13:12.292
Okay. Let's just move on
to the next loan.

13:12.326 --> 13:14.561
Um, a clothing line.
Something called

13:14.595 --> 13:16.163
"Garments and Varmints"?

13:16.196 --> 13:17.698
‐Yo! That's us. Yeah.
‐Yep. Yeah.

13:17.731 --> 13:19.433
Yeah, th‐the name's
a little confusing,

13:19.466 --> 13:21.468
'cause it did end up
being mostly costumes.

13:21.502 --> 13:23.170
CHARLIE:
Yeah, yeah, but it's not
really confusing, you know,

13:23.203 --> 13:25.272
because varmints definitely
played, like, a key role in it.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.673
‐So it's not confusing.
‐Oh, it's confusing.

13:26.707 --> 13:28.609
‐It's incredibly confusing.
‐I'm sorry.

13:28.642 --> 13:29.476
‐But we can go on.
‐Yeah. Yeah.

13:29.510 --> 13:31.144
Uh, I am confused.

13:31.178 --> 13:32.279
Well, of course,
you're confused, Gary.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.280
That's 'cause
you're not a moron.

13:33.313 --> 13:36.450
(both laugh)

13:36.483 --> 13:38.352
All right, let me explain
what happened here, all right?

13:38.385 --> 13:41.088
‐We've been on top of each other
for a long time.
‐Yeah.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.556
CHARLIE:
We bubbled together
during the pandemic

13:42.589 --> 13:44.458
because, well, we're both
essential workers at the bar.

13:44.491 --> 13:47.161
Yeah, yeah. Charlie and I,
we're the last tit on the hog

13:47.194 --> 13:48.529
before the asshole.
(chuckles)

13:50.697 --> 13:53.667
I am so sorry for my partner's
blue language.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.469
It‐it does not represent
our business,

13:55.502 --> 13:57.704
‐and it's extremely off‐putting.
‐It was just a joke.

13:57.738 --> 14:00.541
(sighs)
Just stop. Okay.

14:00.574 --> 14:02.176
The point is, we were
pretty deep in the pandemic

14:02.209 --> 14:06.346
when we, uh,
we got a pretty good idea.

14:06.380 --> 14:08.682
We were gonna sell masks.

14:08.715 --> 14:11.285
DEE:
The world needed masks,
and once our loan came in,

14:11.318 --> 14:13.086
we got all kinds of materials.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.022
Only, there was one problem.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.158
Bam. Check that one out.

14:18.192 --> 14:20.027
‐What the hell is that?
‐That's a mask.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.428
Yeah, of Ronald Reagan, but...

14:21.461 --> 14:24.531
Ronald Reagan? That's Dennis.

14:24.565 --> 14:26.700
‐That's not Dennis?
‐Whether it's Dennis
or Ronald Reagan,

14:26.733 --> 14:28.335
i‐it's not gonna stop
the spread of COVID.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.070
Stop COVID?

14:30.103 --> 14:31.572
Well, we don't need any more
of those kind of masks.

14:31.605 --> 14:33.207
Everybody's making those masks.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.474
Well, they‐they're trying,
right?

14:34.508 --> 14:35.709
But, see, my angle is,
mine are funny.

14:35.742 --> 14:37.678
Look at this.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.179
"Fauch the Grouch."

14:39.213 --> 14:40.747
‐(laughs)
‐Right?

14:40.781 --> 14:43.083
‐Fau‐‐ That's a great name.
Who is that?
‐I know.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.718
"Fauch."

14:44.751 --> 14:46.420
Okay, how about this one?

14:46.453 --> 14:47.754
"Mama needs wine."

14:47.788 --> 14:49.223
‐(laughs)
‐Right? And this is funny

14:49.256 --> 14:51.191
'cause women are
alcoholics who hate their kids.

14:51.225 --> 14:53.260
Yeah, yeah.
But I‐‐ you're, like,

14:53.293 --> 14:55.062
you're missing
the big picture here, Dee.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.430
‐Right? 'Cause, dude...
‐What do you mean?

14:56.463 --> 14:58.298
...the real money is in the
Halloween costume space.

14:58.332 --> 15:00.701
Think about it, man. Everyone's
been stuck together at home,

15:00.734 --> 15:01.735
they're all worried and shit.

15:01.768 --> 15:03.036
They're gonna want
to come together

15:03.070 --> 15:04.304
at the end of next year,
so, like,

15:04.338 --> 15:06.173
Halloween store owners,
they're gonna be, like,

15:06.206 --> 15:08.175
some of the richest people
in America, Dee.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.443
We're not gonna do that.
We're not gonna do‐‐

15:09.476 --> 15:11.011
Let's just do
the medical mask thing.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.479
Uh, number one, it's easier,
and number two,

15:12.513 --> 15:14.314
‐it actually makes sense. Right?
‐Okay. All right.

15:14.348 --> 15:16.083
‐Well, fine,
we'll try your thing.
‐Logical.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.584
‐Okay, fine.
‐Okay.

15:17.618 --> 15:19.319
Anyway, we made
the stupid masks,

15:19.353 --> 15:21.088
but the next challenge
was marketing them.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.323
Sweetie, if you're not gonna
help me homeschool these kids,

15:23.357 --> 15:25.025
can you please
at least do the dishes?

15:25.058 --> 15:27.561
I need to drink wine.

15:27.594 --> 15:30.597
(laughs): I know you do,
but, honey, I got you a gift.

15:30.631 --> 15:32.566
You did? What?

15:32.599 --> 15:35.002
A custom‐made mask.

15:36.503 --> 15:40.007
(cartoon music playing)

15:40.040 --> 15:43.043
(screeches): Are you looking
to party this Halloween?

15:43.076 --> 15:45.012
Are you sick of being jerked
around by the fat cats

15:45.045 --> 15:47.047
in the Halloween industry?

15:47.080 --> 15:50.317
Then we've got the fix for you.
Garments and Varmints.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.319
And now it's all starting
to make sense, right?

15:52.352 --> 15:53.754
Wh‐What? No.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.589
It makes less sense
than it did in the beginning.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.524
‐You're telling it wrong.
‐Gary gets it.

15:57.558 --> 15:58.659
‐No, I‐I don't get it.
‐DEE: Point is,

15:58.692 --> 16:00.294
for reasons we would find out

16:00.327 --> 16:01.695
much later, we did end up
getting a rather sizable order

16:01.728 --> 16:04.164
for costumes from one group.

16:04.198 --> 16:05.699
CHARLIE:
Yeah, uh‐huh, and these guys
were out of state, right,

16:05.732 --> 16:07.701
‐and they wanted them
really fast.
‐We were in a rush.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.303
CHARLIE:
So we were stressed out.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.038
Now, luckily, I was pretty handy
with the old girl,

16:11.071 --> 16:13.173
so we were able to fill out
most of the order.

16:13.207 --> 16:14.575
Although we were
running out of material.

16:14.608 --> 16:17.010
‐Okay, what else do we need?
‐What?

16:17.044 --> 16:18.612
‐What else do we need?
‐Uh, uh, pelts.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.614
‐Get more pelts.
‐What pelts?

16:20.647 --> 16:23.050
The pelts! The pelts, you bitch!

16:23.083 --> 16:25.619
‐Pelts for what?
‐Oh, you bitch.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.454
You insufferable bitch.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.456
I d‐‐ Am I supposed
to even know what that means?

16:29.489 --> 16:30.557
‐Animal pelts!
‐What are we doing
with animal pelts?

16:30.591 --> 16:32.125
I can't sew without the pelts!

16:32.159 --> 16:33.193
Get the pelts, you bitch!

16:33.227 --> 16:34.728
Yeah, now, normally,

16:34.761 --> 16:36.029
I don't call Dee a bitch.

16:36.063 --> 16:37.397
That's sort of Dennis's thing.

16:37.431 --> 16:40.033
‐Dee's a goddamn bitch!
‐(chuckles) Yeah. Uh,

16:40.067 --> 16:41.535
but, you know, her vulgar
language was rubbing off on me,

16:41.568 --> 16:44.071
you know, which wasn't
a good look for the business.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.706
DEE:
The pelts that Charlie's
referring to,

16:45.739 --> 16:47.174
they're from raccoons
that he was tanning

16:47.207 --> 16:48.342
in the basement of this bar.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.043
CHARLIE:
Yeah, well, you see,

16:50.077 --> 16:51.278
the pandemic
had kind of disrupted

16:51.311 --> 16:52.713
the bar's natural ecosystem.

16:52.746 --> 16:54.214
There was a real uptick
in raccoons,

16:54.248 --> 16:55.682
which consider
rat brains a delicacy,

16:55.716 --> 16:57.751
which of‐of course you know,
Gary,

16:57.784 --> 16:59.486
‐and now it's all starting
to make sense.
‐It doesn't make sense.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.355
At least now he understands
why we called the business

17:01.388 --> 17:03.290
‐Garments and Varmints.
‐He doesn't care what we call

17:03.323 --> 17:03.991
‐the business.
‐I believe that the man does!

17:04.024 --> 17:06.126
I'm taking over the whole story!

17:06.160 --> 17:09.163
‐Okay?
‐Please go ahead.

17:09.196 --> 17:11.398
DEE:
It took us three hours,
but we finally arrived

17:11.431 --> 17:14.101
at the place where we were
gonna meet the customer.

17:16.370 --> 17:18.338
‐Gentlemen.
‐MAN: You got the stuff?

17:18.372 --> 17:20.407
‐Absolutely. Give me one minute.
‐Hey.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.210
Digging that face paint.
Very festive.

17:23.243 --> 17:24.611
What are you
gentlemen celebrating?

17:24.645 --> 17:27.080
‐MAN: We're protesting
the election.
‐Yeah!

17:27.114 --> 17:27.981
Okay, well,
I can get behind that,

17:28.015 --> 17:29.550
'cause our guy
did not get a fair shake.

17:29.583 --> 17:31.218
‐Oh.
‐MAN: The whole thing is a sham.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.220
‐Yeah, our guy got screwed, man.
‐Sham.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.455
Okay, so there's the costumes.

17:35.489 --> 17:37.191
I'm especially proud of the
stitching on the animal skins.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.193
‐That was all Charlie.
‐You know what I'd like to do?

17:39.226 --> 17:42.396
Uh, I'd love to throw in
this cool hat for free.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.198
I think it really completes
the look.

17:44.231 --> 17:46.166
‐Let's see.
‐You know? Let's see it there.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.569
‐(gasps) Oh, shit. He's right.
‐Yeah.

17:48.602 --> 17:51.572
Thanks, brother.

17:51.605 --> 17:54.141
Now let's go save this country!

17:54.174 --> 17:57.277
‐(men whooping)
‐All right.

17:57.311 --> 18:00.214
DEE:
Uh, they all seemed
pretty amped up.

18:00.247 --> 18:02.182
But we were, too. I mean,
people have been dragging

18:02.216 --> 18:04.585
our guy's name through the mud,
saying he wasn't fit for office.

18:04.618 --> 18:07.221
Yeah, calling him a narcissist,
saying he was mentally ill,

18:07.254 --> 18:08.322
and that all the people
who showed up

18:08.355 --> 18:10.057
‐for his events were idiots.
‐Yeah, but that's 'cause

18:10.090 --> 18:11.558
they've never seen
the guy onstage.

18:11.592 --> 18:14.595
‐I mean, he's electrifying
onstage.
‐Yeah.

18:14.628 --> 18:17.698
All right, I'm sorry, let me...
try to make sense of this.

18:17.731 --> 18:20.133
You're telling me that you
provided the iconic costumes

18:20.167 --> 18:21.568
at the Capitol riots?

18:21.602 --> 18:23.670
‐Yeah.
‐Yep.

18:23.704 --> 18:26.073
Can't say they weren't
good costumes, Gary.

18:26.106 --> 18:28.008
‐They were great costumes.
‐Isn't that something?
Isn't that something?

18:28.041 --> 18:30.010
Well, uh, listen,
now that we've cleared up

18:30.043 --> 18:31.745
all those previous loans, uh,
we would like to talk to you

18:31.778 --> 18:36.149
‐about giving us a new loan
for Paddy's Pub. Okay...
‐(shouting)

18:36.183 --> 18:38.051
‐Oh my G‐‐ What was that?
‐Oh, sorr‐‐

18:38.085 --> 18:39.286
Firework. Almost got you, pal.

18:39.319 --> 18:40.354
Sorry about that.

18:40.387 --> 18:41.588
‐Fire.
‐Oh!

18:41.622 --> 18:42.589
Huh? What?

18:42.623 --> 18:43.624
Shit, I see it. All right.

18:43.657 --> 18:45.526
Uh, I got it. I got it.

18:45.559 --> 18:47.394
I got it. Sorry, everyone.
All right.

18:52.466 --> 18:55.002
(whoops)
Uh, sorry about that, everybody.

18:55.035 --> 18:56.603
Probably shouldn't have
done that in the bar.

18:56.637 --> 18:58.172
‐Oh, is that right?
‐Yeah, I'm sorry, guys.

18:58.205 --> 18:59.540
‐Yeah. All right, well...
‐I was trying to get

18:59.573 --> 19:01.208
a little fanfare
for the‐the loan.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.609
It was prett‐‐
It was kind of cool.

19:02.643 --> 19:04.545
DENNIS:
Um, so, hey, listen, um,

19:04.578 --> 19:07.314
listen, we really do believe
that with a major cash infusion,

19:07.347 --> 19:09.449
‐we could turn this bar
into something...
‐No, no, no.

19:09.483 --> 19:11.451
‐...even more successful
than it already...
‐No, no, no. Stop.

19:11.485 --> 19:12.719
I‐I have heard enough.

19:12.753 --> 19:14.621
You people have
shamelessly gamed the system

19:14.655 --> 19:17.391
out of massive amounts
of taxpayer dollars

19:17.424 --> 19:20.460
for fictitious businesses
that have gone bankrupt,

19:20.494 --> 19:22.696
and still you have the nerve
to ask for more money?

19:22.729 --> 19:24.164
Well, that's what makes America

19:24.198 --> 19:25.165
the greatest country
in the world.

19:25.199 --> 19:27.134
When you're in need,
the government comes in

19:27.167 --> 19:29.169
‐and bails you out.
‐Nothing made me more money

19:29.203 --> 19:31.405
than businesses
I sent into bankruptcy.

19:31.438 --> 19:33.707
‐Yes‐‐ Yeah, yeah.
‐That's the American way.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.442
‐That's as American
as it gets right there.
‐(agreeable chatter)

19:35.475 --> 19:36.743
That's right, and maybe
if our guy had won,

19:36.777 --> 19:38.712
our businesses could succeed
just like his.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.180
‐They would've been huge hits.
‐Oh, absolutely.

19:40.214 --> 19:41.715
‐Yeah.
‐I think so.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.684
No, no, no, I‐I‐‐ No...
(stammers)

19:43.717 --> 19:46.186
None of these idiotic businesses
would have been successful

19:46.220 --> 19:48.055
whether Trump had won or lost.

19:49.089 --> 19:51.024
‐Huh?
‐Okay.
‐Trump?

19:51.058 --> 19:53.060
‐Yeah. I'm sorry...
‐Yeah, wh‐why are you talking
about Trump?

19:53.093 --> 19:54.561
‐Where'd you get that?
‐Yeah, how are you
getting to that?

19:54.595 --> 19:57.130
Uh, "Washington outsider,
not taken seriously

19:57.164 --> 20:00.067
"by the liberal media,
successful businessman,

20:00.100 --> 20:02.436
unsuccessful in love,
electrifying onstage."

20:02.469 --> 20:04.304
‐Oh, yeah.
‐Yeah, yeah, that's our guy.

20:04.338 --> 20:05.205
‐Yeah, yeah, that's him.
‐Absolutely. Yeah.

20:05.239 --> 20:07.741
‐That's Kanye. Kanye West.
‐Kanye West.

20:07.774 --> 20:08.709
‐He's our guy.
‐Have you seen him onstage?

20:08.742 --> 20:10.477
DENNIS:
Yeah.

20:10.511 --> 20:12.412
Wait, Kanye West?

20:12.446 --> 20:14.581
You all voted for Kanye West?

20:14.615 --> 20:16.583
‐Oh, absolutely.
‐Damn right.
‐100%, pal.

20:16.617 --> 20:18.218
‐You've seen him onstage?
‐All the way.
‐Yeah, man.

20:18.252 --> 20:19.720
He's the best. He's the best.

20:19.753 --> 20:22.422
No. I do not believe you.

20:22.456 --> 20:25.259
I do not believe any of you.
None of this happened.

20:25.292 --> 20:27.561
There is no way
that you were all involved

20:27.594 --> 20:29.530
in every major event
of the past year.

20:29.563 --> 20:31.665
‐Wh‐Why?
‐Why?

20:31.698 --> 20:33.400
Because you're not Forrest Gump!

20:34.735 --> 20:37.437
You'll be hearing from the IRS.

20:41.608 --> 20:44.144
‐Okay.
‐I don't... I don't like him.

20:44.178 --> 20:45.579
I don't think he's gonna
give us the loan.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.581
‐I don't think we're gonna get
the loan, either.
‐No.

20:47.614 --> 20:50.050
You know what we should do?
Let's listen to some Kanye West.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.585
‐Ow!
‐That's what we should do.

20:51.618 --> 20:52.753
That's gonna bring
the mood back up.

20:52.786 --> 20:55.455
We all should be listening
to Kanye West.
