Sensor buried. Stand by
for incoming readings.

01:21.112 --> 01:22.212
It's beautiful Lisa.

01:22.881 --> 01:24.717
Is beautiful even
in your vocabulary?

01:27.052 --> 01:29.121
Seism-sensor readings
are coming in now.

01:30.622 --> 01:32.924
We're definitely
getting some activity,

01:32.925 --> 01:35.626
but Joseph, how is it possible...
Ka'ula hasn't shown

01:35.627 --> 01:38.563
volcanic activity in
five million years.

01:38.863 --> 01:41.370
How is this possible so
far from the hotspot?

01:45.870 --> 01:47.139
Joseph?

01:47.939 --> 01:49.875
Joseph?

01:50.189 --> 01:52.383
Lisa, I think a submerged
volcanic shelf has surfaced.

01:52.384 --> 01:55.616
There are new islands out here.

02:00.518 --> 02:01.678
When does Landon arrive?

02:01.819 --> 02:03.187
He's flying in soon.

02:03.188 --> 02:05.025
We'll need his help
running some tests.

02:14.666 --> 02:16.134
Lisa I got tremors here!

02:16.934 --> 02:19.136
Joseph it's right on top of you!

02:19.137 --> 02:21.749
Go! Now!

02:30.549 --> 02:31.949
Lisa!

02:31.950 --> 02:33.185
Joseph?

03:09.921 --> 03:12.890
Ladies and Gentlemen, the Captain has
turned on the fasten seat belt sign

03:12.891 --> 03:15.459
as we make our descent to Ka'ula.
Please put your tray

03:15.460 --> 03:18.718
tables and seats in their
upright and full position.

03:40.518 --> 03:42.019
Excuse me. Oh!

03:42.020 --> 03:44.806
Um, I'm so sorry sir. We're
preparing to land. Do you mind

03:44.807 --> 03:47.525
bringing your seat forward and
putting your tray table up.

03:47.526 --> 03:49.493
Thank you. I'll take this.

03:49.494 --> 03:51.997
How could you sleep
through this noise?

03:52.797 --> 03:54.209
Practice.

04:04.009 --> 04:07.210
Don't you know it isn't
polite to stare?

04:07.211 --> 04:09.947
Tony! Sit down.

04:09.948 --> 04:12.382
Please. I'm sorry about that.

04:12.383 --> 04:15.121
It's alright. No harm.

04:15.921 --> 04:17.589
Hank right?

04:18.389 --> 04:20.656
You look like a Hank.

04:20.658 --> 04:22.592
Actually is uh...

04:22.593 --> 04:23.693
it's Jim.

04:23.828 --> 04:26.097
Jim Kirkland.

04:26.098 --> 04:27.330
Jennifer.

04:27.331 --> 04:29.700
And you've already met Tony.

04:29.701 --> 04:32.245
Yeah.

04:42.045 --> 04:44.048
How long have you been married?

04:44.049 --> 04:45.983
Oh. We're not yet.

04:45.984 --> 04:48.986
I just like to wear it.

04:48.987 --> 04:51.154
Feel like we are anyway.

04:51.155 --> 04:55.126
I took time my auto body shop to meet
her for a little pre-wedding vacation.

04:55.127 --> 04:58.094
That's nice. You've know
each other a long time then?

04:58.095 --> 04:59.630
Six months.

04:59.631 --> 05:01.965
I know it's a little crazy...

05:01.966 --> 05:05.402
There's nothing crazy about it.
If you don't know it within the

05:05.403 --> 05:09.124
first month that she's the
one then you'll never know.

05:26.924 --> 05:28.892
Control, this is 7389.

05:28.893 --> 05:31.561
We may be experiencing some
technical difficulties,

05:31.562 --> 05:34.698
as our radar shows we're closing in on
what seems to be a heavy storm cloud...

05:34.699 --> 05:39.305
but our reports show very little
turbulence. Can you confirm?

05:42.105 --> 05:44.011
Control, can you confirm?

05:46.811 --> 05:48.382
Radio is malfunctioning.

05:52.182 --> 05:56.422
Control this is 7389 do you copy?

05:57.222 --> 05:58.322
Guess we missed it.

05:59.057 --> 06:00.090
Sir.

06:00.091 --> 06:02.493
Oh. Great um...

06:02.494 --> 06:06.429
My Wi-Fi is acting a little janky. Would you
mind checking it out? See if they can fix it?

06:06.430 --> 06:10.334
No I'm sorry. You actually have to turn
it off and put your tray up for landing.

06:10.335 --> 06:12.170
Oh. Sorry.

06:12.970 --> 06:14.070
It's OK.

06:14.838 --> 06:16.340
Can I take that for you?

06:16.341 --> 06:17.308
Sure thanks.

06:17.309 --> 06:18.409
No problem.

06:27.085 --> 06:28.389
Here.

06:31.189 --> 06:34.291
Please, do you have any aspirin?

06:34.292 --> 06:36.127
No. I'm sorry sir we're out.

06:36.927 --> 06:40.397
Oh god... my head. I hate flying!

06:40.398 --> 06:43.200
My apologies. It's the altitude.

06:43.201 --> 06:45.478
We will be descending soon.

06:53.278 --> 06:54.483
Control?

06:58.283 --> 06:59.383
Captain.

06:59.917 --> 07:01.786
Radio's down.

07:01.787 --> 07:02.887
Down?

07:03.215 --> 07:04.255
That's not what scares me.

07:04.256 --> 07:06.657
What's that?

07:06.658 --> 07:09.595
How long it's been down.

07:17.367 --> 07:21.738
Ladies and gentlemen, we are
experiencing some light... turbulence.

07:21.739 --> 07:24.408
It's OK. It's just an air pocket.

07:29.514 --> 07:31.891
That wasn't an air pocket.

07:39.691 --> 07:41.691
That's not the runway.
Where are we?

07:41.692 --> 07:46.298
Our compass is wrong. There must be
some magnetic interference out there.

07:47.098 --> 07:50.299
Loss of altitude control. The
auto-pilot isn't compensating.

07:50.300 --> 07:51.400
Hold on Spair.

07:52.970 --> 07:55.177
Damn auto-pilot thinks we're
descending on course.

07:59.977 --> 08:01.277
Hey, could you lean back?

08:01.278 --> 08:03.053
What the hell is that?

08:08.853 --> 08:09.953
It's ash.

08:11.823 --> 08:13.356
Auto-Pilot disabled

08:13.357 --> 08:14.924
Now when I tell you...

08:14.925 --> 08:17.430
I need you to lay
down the throttle.

08:18.230 --> 08:19.429
On when I tell you!

08:19.430 --> 08:20.530
I hear ya Captain.

08:26.170 --> 08:28.711
Spair, maximum velocity!

08:33.510 --> 08:35.548
- Come on.
- I'm pushing her.

08:37.347 --> 08:38.683
Come on!

08:40.952 --> 08:42.192
Holly sh...

08:48.459 --> 08:50.026
I can't breathe!

08:50.027 --> 08:51.673
Everyone hang on!

09:06.978 --> 09:08.346
Listen...

09:09.146 --> 09:10.114
Look out!

09:10.115 --> 09:11.215
I see it!

09:17.856 --> 09:19.256
I need you to be on the radio.

09:47.953 --> 09:49.886
Auto-Pilot Engaged

09:49.887 --> 09:51.224
Is everything OK?

09:53.024 --> 09:54.360
Dan!

09:57.160 --> 09:58.630
The code! The code!

10:00.430 --> 10:02.299
For the auto-pilot?

10:03.099 --> 10:05.235
Zero...

10:05.236 --> 10:06.569
Dan!

10:06.570 --> 10:08.041
Zero, Nine...

10:09.841 --> 10:11.408
Dan. Dan!

10:11.409 --> 10:13.544
Dan what is the passcode?

10:13.545 --> 10:15.278
Dan what is the passcode?!

10:15.279 --> 10:17.187
Dan!

10:23.987 --> 10:24.821
Dan come on...

10:24.822 --> 10:26.189
Hey is everything alright?

10:26.190 --> 10:27.256
He-he's not breathing.

10:27.257 --> 10:29.327
Can you help me out...

10:30.127 --> 10:31.431
Oh he's gone.

10:34.231 --> 10:35.465
OK it's on auto-pilot.

10:35.466 --> 10:37.302
- Um Rita?
- Yes.

10:37.303 --> 10:40.417
Rita, get on the radio right there and
get a hold of anybody. Anybody at all.

10:40.418 --> 10:42.558
My name is Rick Pierce.
Do it! Just do it!

10:43.607 --> 10:44.707
Hello?

10:44.809 --> 10:46.510
Can anybody here me?

10:46.511 --> 10:47.645
Hello?

10:47.646 --> 10:49.813
Please help. It's out.

10:49.814 --> 10:51.414
OK yeah. We've been hit.

10:51.415 --> 10:55.426
- You can fly?
- Wait one second. I'll be right back.

11:03.427 --> 11:05.219
- You, what's your name?
- Me? Frank.

11:05.245 --> 11:07.310
Frank come here.
I need your help please.

11:07.711 --> 11:10.435
United States Air
Marshall Kirkland.

11:11.269 --> 11:15.117
- You mind telling me what's going on?
- Yeah, someone's hurt upfront.

11:27.517 --> 11:29.586
Are they dead?

11:29.587 --> 11:32.410
Unconscious. That's all anybody
needs to know right now.

11:32.424 --> 11:34.384
We need the pilot out of his seat.

11:48.973 --> 11:49.672
You OK?

11:49.673 --> 11:51.375
Don't touch me.

11:52.175 --> 11:55.380
I'm sorry. I just
thought you were hurt.

11:56.013 --> 11:58.618
- You sure you're gonna be...
- No.

12:00.418 --> 12:02.475
Well not yet.

12:24.275 --> 12:26.378
He's not really unconscious is he?

12:27.178 --> 12:28.614
He's dead.

12:28.819 --> 12:30.853
Don't let the passengers
see these guys like that.

12:30.854 --> 12:32.115
Gotta get the co-pilot out too.

12:32.116 --> 12:34.936
OK. You got it. I'll keep it quiet.

12:51.736 --> 12:53.470
What's going on?

12:53.471 --> 12:54.571
It's alright.

12:55.946 --> 12:58.180
OK, everybody. I'm Air
Marshall Jim Kirkland.

12:58.181 --> 13:00.977
The pilot is knocked
unconscious but,

13:00.978 --> 13:04.514
everything's OK... If there's
anybody able to give us a hand

13:04.515 --> 13:07.784
with medical training please
help each other out...

13:07.785 --> 13:09.620
That's a volcano!

13:14.192 --> 13:17.871
Hey... I need to know
what you know. I can help.

13:27.671 --> 13:29.845
Show 'em.

13:46.189 --> 13:47.778
Oh my god.

14:07.578 --> 14:09.414
You ever fly anything this big?

14:10.214 --> 14:14.320
No, the largest I've
ever flow is a king air.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.720
9 seater.

14:16.721 --> 14:17.994
Great.

14:22.794 --> 14:25.727
It's stuck on auto-pilot
in a constant loop.

14:25.728 --> 14:30.067
Yeah to prevent terrorist takeovers they
installed an encoded auto-pilot system.

14:30.068 --> 14:32.502
And of course he
knew all the codes.

14:32.503 --> 14:35.506
No Mr. Spair knew them too.

14:36.306 --> 14:37.875
Great.

14:38.675 --> 14:41.046
I study volcanoes and uh...
I doubt this is the worst.

14:41.846 --> 14:43.526
In fact I think she's
just waking up.

14:44.915 --> 14:48.617
Keep your distance and don't fly
us too close or you'll cook us.

14:48.618 --> 14:52.591
No chance of that cause of
the auto-pilot loop, right?

14:54.391 --> 14:55.660
Hope so...

14:57.460 --> 14:59.164
Can you move that thing?

15:00.964 --> 15:04.644
There's a little bit of movement in the wheel.
I might be able to force it to maneuver.

15:09.107 --> 15:11.147
No chance of flying over
that thick ash cloud.

15:11.876 --> 15:13.276
That will destroy our engines.

15:15.979 --> 15:17.614
We're gonna have to ride it out.

15:17.615 --> 15:18.715
Yeah.

15:21.385 --> 15:23.490
And pray we don't get
any aftershocks.

15:32.362 --> 15:34.130
Hey Tully! Wait up.

15:34.131 --> 15:35.698
Thatch, what happened to you?

15:35.699 --> 15:37.266
Breakfast in the
mess hall happened.

15:37.267 --> 15:39.401
Yeah and what do I say?
I said don't eat the gravy.

15:39.402 --> 15:42.371
It's biscuits and gravy. You can't
have one without the other.

15:42.372 --> 15:44.372
Just don't let the old
man see you like this.

15:44.842 --> 15:47.379
Look alive Tully! They're
calling all hands.

15:48.179 --> 15:50.746
I overheard colonel Rhyker
mention a vulcanologist.

15:50.747 --> 15:53.501
That doesn't make sense. What does
Rhyker want with a vulcanologist?

15:53.502 --> 15:54.317
Guess will find out.

15:54.318 --> 15:56.285
Do we have radar reading for 0600?

15:56.286 --> 15:57.889
Not yet.

15:58.689 --> 16:01.124
Well your input and information
will be useful Doctor.

16:01.125 --> 16:05.528
If you can please fill in my Executive Officer
Livingston. We can send you on your way.

16:05.529 --> 16:07.904
Aah-ten-hut!

16:12.704 --> 16:14.471
As you were.

16:14.472 --> 16:15.673
Sir,

16:16.473 --> 16:18.433
Doctor Lisa Whitmore
called in the disaster.

16:20.044 --> 16:23.578
Listen doc, if there were any volcanic
activity. We would already know all about it.

16:23.579 --> 16:27.085
Sir, we are picking up reading
out there... It's big.

16:27.885 --> 16:29.554
Is it a storm?

16:30.209 --> 16:32.363
Excuse me Colonel but you
are not looking at a storm.

16:32.364 --> 16:34.691
You are looking at
an eruption column.

16:34.692 --> 16:36.693
What?

16:36.694 --> 16:41.197
Kaula has been a dead volcanic island
for millions of years until now.

16:41.198 --> 16:45.901
Colonel, my colleague was on
that island when it erupted.

16:45.902 --> 16:48.170
Please let me help.

16:48.171 --> 16:51.605
If you want to help, you can fill in my XO
with everything you know. Starting with...

16:51.606 --> 16:54.011
How did this dead island
suddenly wake up?

16:54.811 --> 16:57.981
My colleague had a similar theory.

16:57.982 --> 17:00.917
Mt. Kilauea has not shown
activity for over a year.

17:00.918 --> 17:04.921
But after thirty years of activity
that pressure has to go somewhere.

17:04.922 --> 17:11.094
Sometimes there are connecting passages where
heat and pressure travel along the crust.

17:11.095 --> 17:17.165
Massive amounts of pressure are forcing
submerged volcanoes to come to the surface.

17:17.166 --> 17:21.006
Colonel. This is
only the beginning.

17:21.806 --> 17:23.607
And it's only gonna get worse.

17:24.406 --> 17:27.584
I am the best that you have.
You need me here.

17:33.384 --> 17:35.617
Get set up. Keep me informed.

17:35.618 --> 17:37.423
Thank you Sir.

17:39.223 --> 17:42.558
Sir, ten minutes ago I was notified
the Lihue Airport lost contact with

17:42.559 --> 17:46.529
one of their airliners coming in
from LAX forty miles off course.

17:46.530 --> 17:49.031
This would put it minutes
after the eruptions.

17:49.032 --> 17:51.866
They overshot their destination.
They're flying blind into a disaster.

17:51.867 --> 17:53.547
They need immediate
rescue assistance.

17:55.271 --> 17:59.376
I cannot initiate an air rescue over
erupting volcanoes and risk my men.

17:59.377 --> 18:01.944
As of now, this island is
in a state of emergency.

18:01.945 --> 18:04.381
Understood, I can notify the island.
Evacuation can be under

18:04.382 --> 18:06.249
way as soon as you
give the order Sir.

18:06.250 --> 18:08.475
Get on it! Get Johnson on the
ground to handle the evac.

18:08.476 --> 18:10.819
Sir, with your permission I'd
like to assist in the evac.

18:10.820 --> 18:16.561
Specialist, I admire your ambition, but
you're not ready son. Get back to your radio.

18:18.361 --> 18:19.461
Yes sir.

18:25.202 --> 18:26.869
What are you waiting for?

18:26.870 --> 18:28.104
Make your calls.

18:28.105 --> 18:29.205
- Yes sir.
- Yes sir.

18:33.844 --> 18:34.944
OK.

18:36.813 --> 18:37.987
Come on.

18:42.787 --> 18:44.356
Everybody hang on!

18:57.067 --> 18:57.966
Come on.

18:57.967 --> 18:59.613
Pull up! Pull up!

19:20.290 --> 19:23.695
Hey somebody come up here
and help us. He's hurt!

19:25.495 --> 19:26.865
Is everybody OK?

19:28.665 --> 19:30.202
No.

19:31.002 --> 19:33.735
OK do we have a first
aid kit on board?

19:33.736 --> 19:35.203
Yeah. Yeah.

19:35.204 --> 19:36.972
Where's the intercom?

19:36.973 --> 19:38.542
It's right there.

19:39.342 --> 19:42.679
Uh everybody, Just remain calm.

19:42.680 --> 19:46.982
Alright first aid is gonna come
around to those who need it.

19:46.983 --> 19:49.251
The best way to get
through this is to

19:49.252 --> 19:53.258
relax and try to work together..

19:55.058 --> 19:56.934
Good luck.

20:06.403 --> 20:07.503
Oh my arm!

20:08.873 --> 20:10.833
Can you help me to move
this out of the way?

20:11.475 --> 20:12.575
- Aah!
- It's broken.

20:16.981 --> 20:18.147
Hang in there.

20:18.148 --> 20:20.116
- Do it. Do it! Do it!
- OK.

20:20.117 --> 20:22.019
1. 2. 3.

20:25.121 --> 20:26.189
Breathe. Breathe.

20:26.190 --> 20:27.656
Just breathe. Just breathe.

20:27.657 --> 20:28.757
You're OK.

20:30.027 --> 20:31.227
Can you use this as a splint?

20:31.228 --> 20:33.132
You're OK. You get me the ace.

20:34.932 --> 20:36.665
You're OK. You're alright.

20:36.666 --> 20:37.766
We got it.

20:38.202 --> 20:39.538
Who's flying this plane?

20:42.338 --> 20:44.641
Sure ain't a pilot.

20:44.642 --> 20:46.643
Hey what's your problem man?

20:46.644 --> 20:50.949
The pilot has been
unconscious for a while.

20:51.749 --> 20:54.952
It doesn't take much to
realize that he's dead.

20:55.752 --> 20:57.787
The pilot's dead?

20:57.788 --> 20:59.754
Hey! Stop it.

20:59.755 --> 21:00.855
Just ignore him.

21:01.826 --> 21:03.386
What about the co-pilot? Is he OK?

21:05.495 --> 21:09.488
Don't waste your breath. They
are dead. Aren't they Rita?

21:30.288 --> 21:34.103
Listen Crieger, do
yourself a favor.

21:34.929 --> 21:39.958
Shut up. Sit down or
I'll put you down.

21:43.733 --> 21:44.980
OK.

21:57.780 --> 21:59.085
Hey. My buddy.

22:00.885 --> 22:01.985
You OK?

22:03.186 --> 22:07.259
I need a favor from you. I need
you to hold on to this for me.

22:08.059 --> 22:09.426
Cool.

22:10.226 --> 22:13.628
And I need you to protect mama.

22:13.629 --> 22:17.269
You do that? I'm counting
on you. Tony macaroni.

22:19.069 --> 22:20.971
Boo-yah.

22:22.940 --> 22:24.442
Thank you.

22:25.242 --> 22:26.583
You're welcome.

22:33.383 --> 22:35.988
You're gonna want to get
your people to Oahu.

22:37.788 --> 22:40.623
You need to get them out
of volcanoes range.

22:40.624 --> 22:42.424
It seems like a good
place to start.

22:42.425 --> 22:43.796
Evac is within the hour.

22:45.596 --> 22:48.798
Good. Secondly, we're going to need to
shoot probe into one of the volcanoes...

22:48.799 --> 22:51.000
If you think I'm going to send
one of my men near those...

22:51.001 --> 22:55.672
All I'm suggesting is to launch a
probe into one of the volcanoes.

22:55.673 --> 22:57.272
So I can better understand them.

22:57.273 --> 22:59.275
What exactly can we
learn from the probe?

22:59.276 --> 23:02.779
Oceanic temperature, Aerial
temperatures, and seismic disturbances.

23:02.780 --> 23:05.384
I may be able to predict
what they'll do next.

23:07.184 --> 23:08.417
That's a go people.

23:08.418 --> 23:10.654
15 minutes to airborne.

23:11.454 --> 23:14.358
Sir. What about the
commercial airline sir?

23:15.158 --> 23:19.462
We may get a visual of it. If we do that
will better help us coordinate a rescue.

23:19.463 --> 23:23.300
Until you get someone on the comm,
focus on your current mission soldier.

23:24.100 --> 23:25.378
Yes, sir.

23:35.178 --> 23:36.745
Work.

23:36.746 --> 23:37.846
Come on.

23:40.416 --> 23:41.516
Of course.

23:44.855 --> 23:47.291
Alright. What exactly are
you doing to that phone?

23:48.091 --> 23:50.326
I'm gutting it... gonna
try to call for help.

23:50.327 --> 23:51.687
Wait wait wait wait a minute.

23:51.861 --> 23:54.062
The phones or the Wi-Fi
they don't work up here.

23:54.063 --> 23:56.231
Well, not entirely.

23:56.232 --> 23:59.306
See all these lines are connected to a
link, which is routed to a satellite,

23:59.307 --> 24:01.069
down to a designated target.

24:01.070 --> 24:04.307
Right now that link is being rejected
because the communications are down.

24:04.308 --> 24:08.743
It's kinda like an unregistered user
trying to get in access, you know?

24:08.744 --> 24:14.986
But if I can by pass that link to the
satellite, I might allow ourselves access.

24:15.786 --> 24:17.118
This will work?

24:17.119 --> 24:19.288
Well, I'll let you know.

24:19.289 --> 24:20.389
OK.

24:22.092 --> 24:24.926
Specialist Tully, What's the
status on the evac of Niihau?

24:24.927 --> 24:27.527
Not great sir. They're running
in to a few snags. The locals

24:27.831 --> 24:30.066
think they can handle
it themselves.

24:30.067 --> 24:33.141
I don't care if they have to drag people
by their feet. Get it taken care of

24:33.142 --> 24:34.770
and get their asses back
to base. Understood?

24:34.771 --> 24:35.637
Sir.

24:35.638 --> 24:37.977
The bird is in-bound.

24:40.777 --> 24:45.719
Niihau control, this is Delta
2-1, approaching targets.

24:48.519 --> 24:49.619
I have visual.

24:54.124 --> 24:56.994
Sir, we have picture.

24:57.794 --> 25:00.296
Delta 2-1 prepared to launch.

25:00.297 --> 25:02.767
Roger that, Delta 2-1.

25:03.567 --> 25:05.433
Interesting...

25:05.434 --> 25:06.935
What?

25:06.936 --> 25:09.038
The lava is superheated
and not very dense.

25:09.039 --> 25:12.109
The lighter the density the most
likely is to stay airborne.

25:12.909 --> 25:15.510
Delta 2-1. You are clear to
launch when you are ready.

25:15.511 --> 25:19.081
Roger. Delta 2-1,
Launching probe in...

25:19.082 --> 25:22.096
3-2-1 Fire!

25:32.896 --> 25:33.962
Direct hit.

25:33.963 --> 25:35.697
Good.

25:35.698 --> 25:37.066
Get him back to base.

25:37.067 --> 25:38.466
Roger that, Delta 2...

25:38.467 --> 25:40.536
Wait! Niihau Control,
I have a visual of...

25:40.537 --> 25:42.203
Delta 2-1 say again.

25:42.204 --> 25:44.442
A thick cloud moving fast!

25:45.242 --> 25:48.478
That cloud isn't just moving fast, it's
clocking in at three hundred knots!

25:48.479 --> 25:50.112
Tell him to get out of there now!

25:50.113 --> 25:52.227
Delta 2-1, return to base!
I repeat, return to base!

25:52.228 --> 25:53.828
Niihau Control... come in.
Come in...

25:53.849 --> 25:57.154
Delta 2-1, get out of there
now! Do you read me?!

25:57.954 --> 26:00.266
Oh my g...

26:09.066 --> 26:10.805
We've lost Captain Elby.

26:14.605 --> 26:18.483
It's still coming! It's thirty thousand
meters from Niihau and closing!

26:18.509 --> 26:21.946
- Twenty thousand meters.
- Who's on the shore?

26:22.440 --> 26:24.681
We need to send out our boys!
Evacuate the coastal areas!

26:24.682 --> 26:28.785
It's too late! Call the beach
patrol and have everyone leave now!

26:29.486 --> 26:30.586
Do it!

26:30.854 --> 26:34.522
Sir, what about everyone
living on shore?

27:06.322 --> 27:09.391
Everyone must evacuate the beach quickly
and calmly! This is an emergency!

27:09.392 --> 27:15.546
Everyone must evacuate the beach quickly
and calmly! This is an emergency!

27:29.346 --> 27:30.446
Colonel.

27:39.857 --> 27:42.859
You're shores are the new Pompeii.

27:43.659 --> 27:48.739
All civilians that are still alive,
get them to safety. Evacuate.

27:55.539 --> 27:56.639
Rita.

27:56.839 --> 27:58.547
Top gun needs you. He has an idea.

28:03.347 --> 28:04.449
Dammit.

28:05.249 --> 28:06.682
Are you OK?

28:06.683 --> 28:08.443
I need you to come
inside for a second.

28:10.119 --> 28:12.989
Alright, I need you to reach
underneath that panel... okay.

28:12.990 --> 28:15.491
Does your hand fit inside there?

28:15.492 --> 28:16.892
Uh, I think so.

28:16.893 --> 28:18.653
OK, look in there
tell me what you see.

28:21.165 --> 28:22.286
Their's a mess in here.

28:22.700 --> 28:24.901
Their's gonna be a circuit
breaker, in there somewhere.

28:24.902 --> 28:27.856
OK. their is like two ways to over
ride this auto pilot, and we lost one.

28:27.857 --> 28:29.605
That is the other one.

28:29.606 --> 28:31.139
Rick, I don't think I can do this.

28:31.140 --> 28:33.715
You can OK. Just reach in
there and feel around.

28:40.550 --> 28:42.992
Careful. careful, careful!

28:49.792 --> 28:52.360
Ah! OK. OK, I think I found
the circuit breaker.

28:52.361 --> 28:53.461
OK.

28:54.392 --> 28:56.432
Oh my God Their's so many
switches. Which one is it?

28:56.433 --> 28:58.749
OK, it's going to look different
than the other switches.

28:58.750 --> 29:00.744
It's gonna either be color
coated or its going to

29:00.745 --> 29:02.425
be a totally different
switch all together.

29:02.426 --> 29:03.826
Do you see anything like that?

29:04.507 --> 29:06.509
Yea, yea... I see it!

29:06.510 --> 29:09.817
OK. I'm gonna do it.

29:13.617 --> 29:15.152
Now!

29:19.022 --> 29:20.390
That's not good.

29:23.127 --> 29:24.432
We're losing fuel.

29:29.232 --> 29:30.731
What, what. I'm sorry.

29:30.732 --> 29:32.635
Grab the wheel.

29:33.435 --> 29:35.070
- I can't!
- Yes you can.

29:35.071 --> 29:38.706
Grab that. Yes you can.
You can do it OK.

29:38.707 --> 29:41.746
Just relax. Hold on.

29:42.546 --> 29:44.453
What is that?

29:53.902 --> 29:55.023
I don't know what I'm doing?

29:55.024 --> 29:58.328
It's OK, just... Ahh! God.

29:59.128 --> 30:00.765
Uh, I'm sorry.

30:01.036 --> 30:03.270
Just if something get's in
your way, then you turn, OK?

30:03.271 --> 30:04.509
OK.

30:12.309 --> 30:13.409
Rick!

30:14.845 --> 30:16.126
Their flying all around us.

30:17.813 --> 30:20.693
As long as you don't flying in them,
I don't care what their doing.

30:25.521 --> 30:26.928
Rick!

30:31.728 --> 30:34.766
OK! OK OK OK.

30:35.566 --> 30:36.732
Rick!

30:38.568 --> 30:40.235
It's getting closer.

30:40.236 --> 30:41.777
Ahh!

30:47.577 --> 30:48.677
OK. I got it.

30:57.886 --> 30:59.324
No more switches for you.

31:01.124 --> 31:05.394
That means that the other
switch has got to be...

31:05.395 --> 31:07.763
Ugh! Great.

31:07.764 --> 31:08.564
What?

31:08.565 --> 31:10.299
Was that not it?

31:10.300 --> 31:12.501
No, no, no. That was it.. But
all the circuit are fried now.

31:12.502 --> 31:16.105
So that means that no way in fixing
this. We're stuck in auto-pilot.

31:16.905 --> 31:18.441
Rick, your hand.

31:18.442 --> 31:19.577
I'll be fine.

31:21.377 --> 31:22.712
That was close.

31:23.512 --> 31:25.347
Yea, It's just the beginning. Look.

31:25.348 --> 31:26.851
And more good news.

31:27.651 --> 31:29.550
How long do we have?

31:29.551 --> 31:31.655
I'd say an hour, at best.

31:32.455 --> 31:33.555
Well what do we do?

31:35.058 --> 31:37.538
We need to check on landing.
See if their's any progress.

31:43.166 --> 31:45.434
Hey genius, how's it going?

31:45.435 --> 31:49.638
Well, I minored in genius but majored
in awesome. It's ready to transmit.

31:49.639 --> 31:50.972
So it works.

31:50.973 --> 31:52.211
Only one way to find out.

31:55.011 --> 31:58.046
Uh, Mayday. Mayday:

31:58.047 --> 32:01.716
Mayday. Mayday.
This is flight 7389.

32:01.717 --> 32:05.554
Flight 7389 requesting immediate
emergency assistance.

32:05.555 --> 32:10.133
I repeat this is fight 7389,
requesting emergency assistance.

32:16.933 --> 32:18.669
This is good.

32:19.469 --> 32:22.029
Do you really want to impress me?
Get somebody on the line.

32:22.105 --> 32:23.205
OK.

32:23.807 --> 32:27.343
Honey, Honey are you OK?

32:27.344 --> 32:29.711
OK. OK.

32:29.712 --> 32:31.548
He'll be OK.

32:32.348 --> 32:37.286
Hey, little buddy. I'll get
you some water, Alright?

32:37.287 --> 32:39.821
Their should be something for
motion sickness, I'll go see.

32:39.822 --> 32:40.922
Oh, OK.

32:47.498 --> 32:51.234
I think our new pilot
is not fit to fly.

32:52.034 --> 32:53.434
Where are you getting at man?

32:53.435 --> 32:54.535
Our pilots are dead.

32:55.038 --> 32:57.705
Rick has endangered us all.

32:57.706 --> 33:01.679
He dumped the fuel and who
know if we have enough.

33:02.479 --> 33:07.226
I say let the auto-pilot do
what it's made to do. Not him!

33:16.026 --> 33:17.996
How does it feel?

33:19.796 --> 33:21.299
Better thank you.

33:23.099 --> 33:25.032
Yeah, let's get 'em!

33:25.033 --> 33:26.133
What the hell is that?

33:26.802 --> 33:28.404
I don't know.

33:33.809 --> 33:35.177
You want some air?

33:35.178 --> 33:37.013
What?

33:37.014 --> 33:38.780
Hey

33:38.781 --> 33:40.782
What the hell are you doing?!

33:40.783 --> 33:42.553
What are you doing?

33:48.058 --> 33:49.528
You bastard!

33:52.328 --> 33:54.762
What the hell is going on here?
What is this?

33:54.763 --> 33:56.531
Your ejection.

33:56.532 --> 33:57.632
My what?

34:06.608 --> 34:07.746
Open It.

34:09.545 --> 34:11.047
No!

34:11.047 --> 34:14.884
This man has endangered
us all. Open it!

34:14.885 --> 34:18.289
I am not gonna throw
him off a plane.

34:19.089 --> 34:25.998
You are not with me then... you
will join him. Open the door!

34:28.797 --> 34:31.869
Crieger!!

34:32.668 --> 34:34.840
Drop... it!

34:37.639 --> 34:39.208
Everybody!

34:40.007 --> 34:42.786
Back in the cabin! Move!

34:50.585 --> 34:52.688
Rick... Fly.

34:52.688 --> 34:53.925
Yes sir.

34:55.725 --> 35:02.197
That man has repeatedly saved lives
and you're gonna attack him?

35:02.198 --> 35:04.769
He's killed us all.

35:06.569 --> 35:09.942
Just give me on reason and
I'll blow your head right now.

35:11.742 --> 35:13.311
There are children watching.

35:16.111 --> 35:17.581
You're right.

35:18.381 --> 35:20.047
You want to throw a
man out the door?

35:20.048 --> 35:21.253
Good role model.

35:23.053 --> 35:26.157
I know where exactly
where to shut you down.

35:27.957 --> 35:29.057
Sit.

35:38.834 --> 35:42.271
What did you think was going to
happen when you open the door,

35:42.272 --> 35:45.177
when the cabin wasn't
depressurized?

35:47.977 --> 35:49.481
Think about that.

35:52.281 --> 35:54.014
And don't mind the smell.

35:54.015 --> 35:55.621
Watch Rick.

35:57.421 --> 35:58.152
What?

35:58.153 --> 36:00.121
I said watch Rick.

36:00.122 --> 36:02.159
And watch him close.

36:02.959 --> 36:08.005
Keeping me in here isn't gonna stop
him from killing us all Marshall.

36:19.042 --> 36:21.144
You have a beautiful family.

36:22.944 --> 36:24.887
Where are they now?

36:31.687 --> 36:32.787
He's detained.

36:33.055 --> 36:34.733
Good.

36:44.533 --> 36:45.633
You OK?

36:46.267 --> 36:49.005
Yeah. Thank you for that.

36:49.805 --> 36:50.905
My pleasure.

36:52.809 --> 36:56.911
I'ma ask you this only once...

36:56.912 --> 36:59.548
And you tell me the truth.

37:00.348 --> 37:05.893
Can - you - fly - this - plane?

37:11.693 --> 37:12.797
Yes.

37:13.597 --> 37:15.733
I can.

37:17.533 --> 37:19.536
I don't care about anything else.

37:20.336 --> 37:25.744
Just don't get us killed.

37:28.544 --> 37:31.280
Someone should have heard the
distress call by now, right?

37:32.080 --> 37:33.518
The kid's trying.

37:35.318 --> 37:37.695
No doubt about that.

37:46.495 --> 37:51.699
Mayday. Mayday this is flight 7389
requesting immediate emergency assistance.

37:51.700 --> 37:53.610
Do you copy?

38:00.410 --> 38:05.980
Mayday. Mayday.
This is flight 7-3-8-9.

38:05.981 --> 38:10.226
Requesting immediate emergency assistance.
Is there anybody out there?

38:17.026 --> 38:21.663
Mayday. Mayday this is flight 7389
requesting immediate emergency assistance.

38:21.664 --> 38:23.300
Do you copy?

38:27.537 --> 38:29.110
Please somebody pick up.

38:33.910 --> 38:35.010
Tully?

38:36.946 --> 38:40.715
Mayday. Mayday this is flight 7389
requesting immediate emergency assistance.

38:40.716 --> 38:41.816
Do you copy?

38:43.385 --> 38:47.559
Tully, what was the Flight number
on that lost airliner again?

38:49.359 --> 38:53.260
Flight 7389. Why?

38:53.261 --> 38:55.467
I think I just found them.

38:58.267 --> 38:59.735
Colonel Rhyker, sir.

38:59.736 --> 39:02.871
The airliner, we've made contact.

39:02.872 --> 39:04.440
Sir!

39:05.240 --> 39:07.579
You're gonna wanna hear this.

39:09.379 --> 39:14.748
Mayday, mayday. This is Flight 7389
requesting emergency assistance.

39:14.749 --> 39:16.384
That's Landon! That's his flight.

39:16.385 --> 39:18.052
You know him?

39:18.053 --> 39:20.327
He's a friend. Was supposed
to fly in today and meet us.

39:20.328 --> 39:21.456
- Vaughn, get a hold of them!
- Yes sir!

39:21.457 --> 39:22.456
Where are they?

39:22.457 --> 39:23.391
That's the thing, sir...

39:23.392 --> 39:24.445
Thatch.

39:24.446 --> 39:25.630
Yes sir.

39:28.430 --> 39:30.465
They're in the 7th circle of hell.

39:30.466 --> 39:32.268
They're lucky to be alive.

39:33.068 --> 39:35.302
You've gotta do something!

39:35.303 --> 39:38.340
We are in the middle of evacuating everyone
off the island. That's our priority.

39:38.341 --> 39:43.646
With all due respect sir, this is how we make
it right. We save as many as we possibly can.

39:43.647 --> 39:45.947
Even if we initiate an
evac rescue mission...

39:45.948 --> 39:51.353
the probability that we'll even
penetrate that wall of fire is unlike.

39:51.354 --> 39:56.625
Honestly, we're talking about a
random erupting wall. It's risky.

39:56.626 --> 39:58.297
But I'm not saying it's impossible.

40:01.097 --> 40:03.364
Flight 7-3-8-9. come in - 89.

40:03.365 --> 40:06.245
This is the Niihau Joint Task Force
Operations Center, do you read?

40:06.803 --> 40:09.806
I've got someone...
I've got someone!

40:11.606 --> 40:13.943
Someone's transmitting to us.

40:14.743 --> 40:19.748
Uh, yes, hello? Come in.
This is flight 7389!

40:19.749 --> 40:23.885
You're alive! Who is
this, is this Landon?

40:23.886 --> 40:29.958
Yes. This is Landon. How do
you know me? You know me?

40:29.959 --> 40:34.231
That's right. Your colleague
Dr. Whitmore is here.

40:35.031 --> 40:36.766
Lisa. Boy do I owe you.

40:38.566 --> 40:44.239
OK Listen. My name is Private Vaugh. Can
you tell me what your situation status is?

40:44.240 --> 40:46.007
Uh sure. Situation status.

40:46.008 --> 40:48.909
Uh... We lost both our pilots.

40:48.910 --> 40:50.579
Uh, we nearly crashed.

40:50.580 --> 40:54.382
We nearly blew up, and there's
this guys up here who's is

40:54.383 --> 40:56.884
super close to a
psychotic melt down.

40:56.885 --> 41:01.489
Oh! And we're flying in the
middle of a ring of volcanoes.

41:01.490 --> 41:03.728
You have thoughts?

41:05.528 --> 41:09.065
Roger that. What's your
altitude and your fuel like?

41:09.865 --> 41:11.599
Uh, what's our altitude?

41:11.600 --> 41:15.103
Uh, around 10,000 feet.

41:15.104 --> 41:19.708
We're around 10,000 feet... but
we have lost a lot of fuel.

41:19.709 --> 41:22.376
OK. Roger that Landon.
Sit tight for a second.

41:22.377 --> 41:24.378
OK sure.

41:24.379 --> 41:26.614
Tully Sir.

41:26.615 --> 41:28.985
They're outta fuel.

41:29.785 --> 41:31.391
Patch 'em through.

41:35.191 --> 41:38.092
Landon? It's Lisa.

41:39.629 --> 41:42.364
Lisa, It's good to hear your voice.

41:42.365 --> 41:43.898
Just hang in OK?

41:43.899 --> 41:45.632
Your gonna be fine.

41:45.633 --> 41:48.036
OK, we'll do our best.

41:48.037 --> 41:50.137
And Landon...

41:50.138 --> 41:52.974
Who rocks?

41:52.975 --> 41:54.708
You rock.

41:54.709 --> 41:56.911
Landon, you're outta fuel?

41:56.912 --> 42:02.483
Not yet but uh, we don't have a lot left.
I'd say probably less then an hour.

42:02.484 --> 42:05.719
OK Landon. This is
colonel Rhyker...

42:05.720 --> 42:08.391
He's gonna tell you what to do.

42:11.260 --> 42:12.460
Son...

42:12.461 --> 42:14.362
Just relax.

42:14.363 --> 42:16.730
Keep everyone calm and sit tight.

42:16.731 --> 42:19.485
We're gonna do everything in our
power to get you out of there safe.

42:19.486 --> 42:20.487
OK just one thing I...

42:20.803 --> 42:25.072
Based on my readings of the
quake I don't think we have a

42:25.073 --> 42:27.108
Landon?

42:27.109 --> 42:28.275
Landon?

42:28.276 --> 42:29.376
We've lost comm. Sir.

42:29.845 --> 42:31.248
Dammit!

42:32.048 --> 42:33.768
The ash cloud is
causing interference.

42:35.350 --> 42:36.450
Sir!

42:37.453 --> 42:39.127
I am urging you to
reconsider the rescue.

42:39.128 --> 42:40.721
Stand Special.

42:40.722 --> 42:43.036
Those people will die up there
if you don't do something!

42:43.037 --> 42:44.492
Then they're dead in the air!

42:44.493 --> 42:47.628
I give the orders around here.

42:47.629 --> 42:49.764
And my men are not dying today.

42:49.765 --> 42:51.199
Colonel do you think...

42:51.200 --> 42:54.469
Speak out of line one more time.

42:54.470 --> 42:59.510
And you will be begging me for a
court-Martial when I'm done with you.

43:00.310 --> 43:02.177
Yes...

43:02.178 --> 43:03.280
Sir!

43:06.080 --> 43:09.719
If you boys are done,
I've got something.

43:10.519 --> 43:13.267
Our probe is picking up
rising sea temperatures

43:13.293 --> 43:16.324
and seismic activity in
ascending intervals.

43:16.425 --> 43:17.559
What does that mean?

43:17.560 --> 43:19.626
Meaning it's counting down.

43:19.627 --> 43:21.563
Counting down to what?

43:21.564 --> 43:23.831
Well considering the quake's
source, duration, and magnitude...

43:23.832 --> 43:29.471
The crust can only take so much pressure
before magma builds and punches through.

43:29.472 --> 43:31.206
You mean another eruption?

43:31.207 --> 43:34.543
Yeah. Yeah more massive
than all the others.

43:35.343 --> 43:36.443
And then what?

43:38.914 --> 43:41.784
We lose.

43:44.720 --> 43:47.362
Colonel could I talk to you
over here for a second.

43:54.162 --> 43:55.706
Come with me.

44:04.506 --> 44:06.407
We are saving those people.

44:06.408 --> 44:08.041
Period.

44:08.042 --> 44:11.112
But we don't have authorization
from Colonel Rhyker.

44:11.113 --> 44:12.547
We do now.

44:12.548 --> 44:14.514
Besides, Rhyker's
busy with the island.

44:14.515 --> 44:16.617
That looks like the real thing.

44:16.618 --> 44:19.286
Rhyker can't save them but we can.

44:19.287 --> 44:22.325
I am not letting anybody
else die today understood?

44:22.925 --> 44:28.061
The people I care about are on that plane.
So you can't do this without my help.

44:28.062 --> 44:29.297
OK.

44:29.298 --> 44:31.366
First...

44:31.367 --> 44:33.639
We get that tanker.

44:50.553 --> 44:51.659
That's not good.

44:57.459 --> 44:58.628
The engine is jammed.

44:59.428 --> 45:01.500
Something is lodged inside.

45:04.300 --> 45:05.421
I'm gonna talk to Rick.

45:07.035 --> 45:08.371
Wait. What?

45:09.171 --> 45:10.775
Everything's OK.

45:12.575 --> 45:13.675
It's OK.

45:19.147 --> 45:20.247
Tell me right now...

45:21.724 --> 45:23.758
Can you level this plane
with that engine clogged?

45:23.759 --> 45:25.552
No. Not unless...

45:25.553 --> 45:27.188
We fix it.

45:27.189 --> 45:28.556
Yeah but how?

45:28.557 --> 45:30.157
You send me out there.

45:30.158 --> 45:32.731
I can unclog that and get it going.

45:35.531 --> 45:38.000
Can we even open that door?

45:38.001 --> 45:42.536
Well we're at 10,000 feet and if I ease
back on the throttle, Yeah we can.

45:42.537 --> 45:44.505
What? Are you serious?

45:44.506 --> 45:46.311
You have a better idea?

45:48.111 --> 45:51.949
I need my bag. It
has my tools in it.

45:52.749 --> 45:56.284
Even if you do unclog it, that engine will
immediately try to suck you right back in.

45:56.285 --> 45:57.586
I'm seeing my wife.

45:58.386 --> 46:00.224
And going on vacation.

46:02.024 --> 46:07.829
I took time of my job, where I'm more likely
to get flattened, working on a car, she says.

46:08.629 --> 46:10.507
This isn't any different.

46:27.917 --> 46:29.753
You sure about this?

46:30.553 --> 46:32.322
What choice do we have?

46:34.122 --> 46:35.527
Ready?

46:38.327 --> 46:39.637
Go.

46:48.437 --> 46:50.440
Lift it up like this.

46:51.240 --> 46:52.340
OK.

47:06.921 --> 47:12.664
OK here we go! Steady!
Easy easy. Hold steady!

47:19.401 --> 47:21.543
I'm on my way baby.

47:49.597 --> 47:51.099
Hold on tight.

47:51.100 --> 47:52.382
Easy!

48:18.060 --> 48:19.231
Alright.

48:22.031 --> 48:23.131
Hold it!

48:45.086 --> 48:46.521
Come on!

48:46.522 --> 48:47.622
Come on.

48:47.823 --> 48:49.625
Come on!

48:55.664 --> 48:56.797
I got it!

48:56.798 --> 48:57.932
I got it!

49:04.740 --> 49:05.640
Pull 'em in!

49:05.641 --> 49:06.673
Easy does it.

49:06.843 --> 49:09.786
OK! Easy!

50:04.867 --> 50:06.717
It's OK. It's OK.

50:21.517 --> 50:22.617
Frank's gone.

50:24.285 --> 50:25.385
I know.

50:25.921 --> 50:27.193
And we're loosing altitude.

50:30.993 --> 50:32.992
They're taking a beating up there.

50:32.993 --> 50:37.900
Sir, we've got an inbound bogey...
multiple bogeys heading right for us.

50:43.705 --> 50:44.505
Hello?

50:44.506 --> 50:46.641
Is anyone there?

50:47.810 --> 50:50.612
We just lost someone and 2
of our engines are out.

50:50.613 --> 50:52.679
Do you copy?

50:52.680 --> 50:54.583
Is anyone there?

50:55.783 --> 50:58.954
Dammit. Why isn't anyone answering?

50:59.754 --> 51:01.755
Hello? Is anyone there?

51:01.756 --> 51:03.360
We read you!

51:04.794 --> 51:07.668
It's possible for a 747 to fly on two
engines but you may be too heavy.

51:07.669 --> 51:10.189
You lose another one and you'll
glide down and eventually crash.

51:10.190 --> 51:11.932
What about the luggage?
We can dump all that.

51:11.933 --> 51:13.768
Do it! We're getting
hit hard over here.

51:13.769 --> 51:16.572
All hands. Get those
injured inside!

51:22.410 --> 51:25.181
Code Red! Take cover!

51:29.986 --> 51:31.786
Incoming!

51:50.439 --> 51:51.959
This is never gonna work.

52:07.323 --> 52:09.791
What do people put
in their luggage?

52:09.792 --> 52:13.300
Get the wounded inside!
get inside now!

52:30.678 --> 52:31.778
Thatch come here!

52:32.847 --> 52:34.687
Grab him from the other side.
Get him up!

52:35.917 --> 52:37.657
Aah!

52:42.457 --> 52:45.059
- Get him inside!
- I'm on my way now!

52:45.060 --> 52:46.594
I'm not going anywhere.

52:46.595 --> 52:49.304
Tully! Tully we need your help!
Come with me.

52:55.104 --> 52:56.204
That should do it.

52:56.972 --> 52:58.206
Everything's gone.

52:58.207 --> 52:59.307
Did it do anything?

53:01.010 --> 53:04.884
Nope. We're still too heavy.

53:48.857 --> 53:50.224
Hey.

53:50.225 --> 53:51.891
No word from base yet.

53:51.892 --> 53:53.929
We're still too heavy.

53:54.729 --> 53:57.797
If I were a plane what
could I get rid of?

53:57.798 --> 54:01.034
Something that's useless
and we no longer need.

54:01.035 --> 54:02.871
Crieger would be nice.

54:02.872 --> 54:03.972
Look out!

54:14.348 --> 54:15.487
Sit down. Buckle up.

54:19.287 --> 54:21.695
Ladies and gentlemen take
your seats and buckle up.

54:21.721 --> 54:23.888
This is about to get
very interesting.

54:28.763 --> 54:29.863
What are you doing?

54:30.545 --> 54:32.139
Getting rid of some
unwanted equipment.

54:32.140 --> 54:33.806
What?

54:38.606 --> 54:42.141
Rick, listen to me! You can't do this!
You're gonna get us killed!

54:42.142 --> 54:43.010
Not today!

54:43.011 --> 54:44.785
I have a lot of things that
I want to do with my life.

54:44.811 --> 54:47.280
- I'm begging you please. Do not this!
- Here it comes.

54:47.281 --> 54:48.652
No no no no no!

54:58.160 --> 55:00.501
You are going to kill us!

55:15.343 --> 55:18.145
How do you not do
this professionally?!

55:18.146 --> 55:21.485
I buckle under official status.

55:23.285 --> 55:25.119
We stopped descending at 4,000 ft.

55:25.120 --> 55:27.364
Whoo!

55:35.164 --> 55:36.298
Excuse me Colonel?

55:37.098 --> 55:38.268
May I ask you something?

55:39.068 --> 55:40.000
Over here?

55:40.001 --> 55:41.603
Let's make it quick.

55:47.642 --> 55:49.210
Hey are you there?

55:49.211 --> 55:50.846
Yeah. I've been
trying to reach you.

55:50.847 --> 55:52.413
We managed to level the plane out.

55:52.414 --> 55:53.547
How did you do that?

55:53.548 --> 55:56.282
Uh, we took off 2 of the engines?

55:56.283 --> 55:59.054
Uh, Wow! Uh,...

55:59.854 --> 56:01.956
OK what's you altitude?

56:01.957 --> 56:03.860
4,000 ft.

56:04.000 --> 56:07.034
That's cutting it a little too close
for our tanker. We're calling him off.

56:07.035 --> 56:08.836
Don't worry. We still
have rescue coming.

56:10.499 --> 56:12.419
Call of the tanker.
It's way too dangerous.

56:12.834 --> 56:15.637
Hope you're getting
some one equally crazy.

56:15.638 --> 56:18.405
Don't worry. We're
getting our best.

56:18.406 --> 56:21.010
Alright. What's your ETA?
When can I expect ya?

56:21.810 --> 56:23.311
Give me 15 minutes.

56:23.312 --> 56:25.380
15 minutes? OK that's
cutting it a little close.

56:25.381 --> 56:27.114
I think we've only got about 30.

56:27.115 --> 56:28.114
Roger that.

56:28.115 --> 56:29.793
Tully out.

56:38.593 --> 56:41.630
Please let me be wrong.

56:42.430 --> 56:44.099
This is Ronald 2-5 inbound.

56:44.899 --> 56:46.467
Roger that bravo 2-5.

56:46.468 --> 56:47.867
Boys be careful out there huh?

56:47.868 --> 56:49.773
Roger control.

56:51.573 --> 56:53.574
Targets in sight, Niihau control.

56:53.575 --> 56:57.411
Roger that, Bravo 2-5.
Tread lightly once inside.

56:57.412 --> 56:58.512
Walk in the park.

56:58.847 --> 57:02.286
I see an opening, control.
Bravo 2- 5 going in.

57:05.086 --> 57:06.188
Control, we're in.

57:07.782 --> 57:10.096
Roger that, Bravo 2-5. Do you
have visual of the package?

57:10.097 --> 57:13.226
Roger, control. We have visual.

57:13.227 --> 57:16.431
Roger that. Good luck.

57:16.432 --> 57:19.268
Bravo 2-5 setting her
under the cargo hold.

57:20.068 --> 57:21.304
Landon?

57:22.751 --> 57:24.945
A rescue plane is right blow you.
You're gonna have to

57:24.946 --> 57:26.866
lower passengers from your
cargo hold understand?

57:26.867 --> 57:28.882
OK I'm getting everyone
together right now.

57:33.682 --> 57:36.150
Help's here. They want
us in the cargo hold.

57:36.151 --> 57:37.317
You're kidding?

57:37.318 --> 57:39.454
No. I don't joke about rescues.

57:39.455 --> 57:40.688
Alright, I'll catch up.

57:40.689 --> 57:43.056
Bravo 2-5. Collecting the package.

57:43.057 --> 57:44.394
Roger that.

57:58.539 --> 58:00.043
Let's go let's go let's go!

58:02.843 --> 58:04.547
OK, ready?

58:05.347 --> 58:06.681
Alright.

58:07.429 --> 58:09.423
We are receiving our
first passenger.

58:09.424 --> 58:11.489
Roger that Bravo 2-5.

58:15.289 --> 58:16.222
Are you good?

58:16.223 --> 58:17.383
Stay right here alright?

58:18.026 --> 58:21.733
Control, we're losing
daylight out here.

58:24.533 --> 58:27.875
You'll be alright. You got it.

58:33.675 --> 58:34.844
Man.

58:37.413 --> 58:39.487
We're experiencing some
lighting over here control.

58:39.488 --> 58:42.018
Roger that Bravo 2-5.
What do you got?

58:42.818 --> 58:46.587
The ash cloud's giving off some
heavy electrical activity.

58:46.588 --> 58:49.690
Bravo 2-5 double time it. Copy?

58:49.691 --> 58:51.625
You!

58:51.626 --> 58:54.860
Sir! We're getting the passengers on the
rescue plane. Vaughn pull up on screen.

58:54.861 --> 58:56.597
Double-time it.

58:57.397 --> 58:58.497
Alright, ready buddy?

58:58.867 --> 59:00.567
Give us two minutes, sir, please!

59:00.568 --> 59:04.070
Alright at the count of 3. 1...

59:04.071 --> 59:05.507
2...

59:10.544 --> 59:12.114
Control, we are hit!

59:17.885 --> 59:20.434
We're going down! We're going down!

59:33.234 --> 59:35.172
Explain yourself specialist.

59:37.972 --> 59:39.674
Sir...

59:39.675 --> 59:42.349
You really thought this could work?
By deliberately disobeying me?

59:42.350 --> 59:44.510
And by forging orders
to issue this mission?

59:44.511 --> 59:47.880
You and your team are
relieved of duty.

59:47.881 --> 59:48.748
Sir...

59:48.749 --> 59:50.251
You will be court martialed.

59:51.051 --> 59:53.152
Now get to your station
and wait there.

59:53.153 --> 59:54.393
The MP's are on their way.

59:54.856 --> 59:57.623
And get that off the screen.

59:57.624 --> 59:59.474
Get it off!

01:00:29.925 --> 01:00:31.058
Hey everyone.

01:00:31.059 --> 01:00:33.726
Umm...

01:00:33.727 --> 01:00:37.567
I got this thing to
transmit and uh...

01:00:38.367 --> 01:00:42.268
If you have something that
you want to say to someone,

01:00:42.269 --> 01:00:43.489
Feel free.

01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:03.027
Is there anyone that you
want to say something to?

01:01:06.827 --> 01:01:14.434
It's not over! I don't understand how
you can stand there and think that!

01:01:14.435 --> 01:01:16.172
How could you not?

01:01:16.972 --> 01:01:20.110
Just let me fly.

01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:24.356
OK.

01:01:35.156 --> 01:01:36.556
MP!

01:01:36.557 --> 01:01:38.195
Remove that man!

01:01:40.995 --> 01:01:42.262
Colonel...

01:01:42.263 --> 01:01:45.168
- You can't do this!
- I don't want to hear it.

01:01:46.968 --> 01:01:50.505
No. No! You don't understand!

01:01:50.514 --> 01:01:53.548
Something within the ring of the
volcano is growing rapidly.

01:01:53.649 --> 01:01:57.076
- I'm warning you doctor.
- Colonel just... just look.

01:01:57.077 --> 01:02:01.481
The pressure...is all
congregating in one spot.

01:02:01.482 --> 01:02:06.152
And it's only a matter of time before
this thing rises. And it's big!

01:02:06.153 --> 01:02:09.623
Roughly 3 miles in diameter.
Just look! Take a look.

01:02:09.624 --> 01:02:11.590
You're done! MP?

01:02:11.591 --> 01:02:13.659
- You need to hear this!
- Take 'em both away.

01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:15.635
- No! Wait! You don't understand!
- Just look!

01:02:15.830 --> 01:02:19.101
Vaughn patch it through!

01:02:19.901 --> 01:02:22.538
Hi my name is Landon Todd.

01:02:23.338 --> 01:02:26.876
I hope somebody's
listening to this.

01:02:27.676 --> 01:02:30.045
I never got to see my dad much...

01:02:31.845 --> 01:02:36.253
Not a day goes by that I wish I just
spent more time being with him.

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.920
Dad if you could hear this I
just want you to know that I

01:02:40.921 --> 01:02:43.193
never thought you
were a bad father.

01:02:45.993 --> 01:02:50.300
And I wish we could make
up for lost time...

01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:54.503
But I guess this is what we got.

01:02:58.805 --> 01:03:00.443
I love you pops!

01:03:02.243 --> 01:03:04.617
Not a day goes by that
I feel differently.

01:03:09.417 --> 01:03:11.519
Do you hear them Colonel?

01:03:12.319 --> 01:03:14.554
I don't know what to say...

01:03:14.555 --> 01:03:16.956
My name is Shirley Jones...

01:03:16.957 --> 01:03:20.929
And I'm 67 years old.

01:03:21.729 --> 01:03:29.335
I's like to believe that my husband George
can hear this but he can't... he's gone.

01:03:29.336 --> 01:03:33.541
I see you when I close my eyes.

01:03:33.542 --> 01:03:38.579
And you are so beautiful.

01:03:40.948 --> 01:03:43.851
I'll be with you soon.

01:03:54.394 --> 01:03:56.396
We can save them.

01:03:56.397 --> 01:04:00.402
You can save them.

01:04:01.202 --> 01:04:03.871
Please...

01:04:04.671 --> 01:04:07.440
Please...

01:04:07.441 --> 01:04:13.916
If anyone can hear
this please help us!

01:04:15.716 --> 01:04:19.155
I have my child...

01:04:19.955 --> 01:04:22.458
a little boy.

01:04:23.258 --> 01:04:26.460
I have my little boy.

01:04:26.461 --> 01:04:28.463
Please...

01:04:29.263 --> 01:04:33.266
He's only 8 years old
for Christ Sake!

01:04:33.267 --> 01:04:34.570
Please!

01:04:36.370 --> 01:04:41.577
Please if anyone can hear
this, please help us...

01:04:42.377 --> 01:04:44.748
Help us.

01:04:47.548 --> 01:04:49.119
We can't just let them die.

01:04:51.919 --> 01:04:54.224
I don't think you can either.

01:04:56.024 --> 01:04:58.661
Help me!

01:05:00.461 --> 01:05:02.699
Help them.

01:05:04.499 --> 01:05:05.802
Men...

01:05:07.602 --> 01:05:09.103
We have a duty.

01:05:09.903 --> 01:05:12.538
And that is to protect our people.

01:05:12.539 --> 01:05:14.112
No matter how dangerous.

01:05:17.912 --> 01:05:20.014
Sergeant Graham?

01:05:20.814 --> 01:05:22.215
Ready the jets.

01:05:22.216 --> 01:05:23.885
Yes Sir!

01:05:24.292 --> 01:05:26.526
Sir, by doing this you will
be disobeying state orders.

01:05:26.527 --> 01:05:29.924
Besides, what you are
talking about is suicide.

01:05:29.925 --> 01:05:31.724
Are these people
really worth the risk?

01:05:31.725 --> 01:05:34.762
We're not only saving them...

01:05:35.562 --> 01:05:37.036
We're saving all of us.

01:05:41.836 --> 01:05:43.038
And you...

01:05:43.838 --> 01:05:45.675
Back to your post, Specialist.

01:05:47.475 --> 01:05:49.882
Yes Sir!

01:06:00.521 --> 01:06:02.422
This bitch is heating up.

01:06:02.423 --> 01:06:05.195
Giving us a hell of a
lot of turbulence.

01:06:06.995 --> 01:06:10.697
They're scared. And so am I.

01:06:10.698 --> 01:06:12.632
Don't be.

01:06:12.633 --> 01:06:14.606
Sit.

01:06:18.406 --> 01:06:21.242
Listen...

01:06:22.042 --> 01:06:26.079
You're going to make
it to you families.

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:30.996
We're all gonna make
it through this.

01:06:42.796 --> 01:06:49.373
The only thing I love in this world
is a picture of my wife and kids.

01:06:52.173 --> 01:06:55.942
After I was told they
were taken from me...

01:06:55.943 --> 01:06:58.213
I kept flying.

01:06:59.013 --> 01:07:04.583
S-Somehow I could turn back time
and they'd be waiting for me...

01:07:04.584 --> 01:07:06.356
when I landed...

01:07:08.156 --> 01:07:12.726
I'm gonna keep on flying.

01:07:12.727 --> 01:07:17.498
Not for my family... but for us.

01:07:17.499 --> 01:07:19.900
For all of us.

01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:24.371
This is not the time to say your
goodbyes or your prayers...

01:07:24.372 --> 01:07:28.474
This is the time to
gather your courage!

01:07:28.475 --> 01:07:32.016
We're gonna face thing head on!

01:07:34.816 --> 01:07:36.585
I can still fly.

01:07:38.385 --> 01:07:39.556
I can still fly.

01:07:42.356 --> 01:07:48.430
The only way we beat them is if we relieve
pressure from their magma chamber here.

01:07:49.530 --> 01:07:52.433
This is where we focus our attack.

01:07:52.434 --> 01:07:55.168
Easier said than done, Doctor.
We won't stand a chance.

01:07:55.169 --> 01:08:01.373
Several direct hits to their core will
rupture enough passages to release the magma

01:08:01.374 --> 01:08:05.314
From its base in to the
ocean, killing the eruptions.

01:08:05.814 --> 01:08:08.650
We just might have
a chance. Questions?

01:08:09.450 --> 01:08:10.585
Good Luck.

01:08:11.385 --> 01:08:13.186
You don't have to do this Sir.

01:08:13.187 --> 01:08:14.920
We have plenty of our guys
suited up and ready to go.

01:08:14.921 --> 01:08:19.326
Soldier, these are my men and
I'll lead them how I see fit.

01:08:19.327 --> 01:08:20.225
Yes Sir!

01:08:20.227 --> 01:08:21.738
Now get your ass back to BDOC.

01:08:30.537 --> 01:08:31.604
Sir...

01:08:31.604 --> 01:08:33.104
I got us a rescue team.

01:08:33.106 --> 01:08:35.442
The plane is a little bulky

01:08:35.443 --> 01:08:38.997
But it flies on props so they won't have any
problems flying through the ash in the air.

01:08:38.997 --> 01:08:39.145
It's perfect.

01:08:39.145 --> 01:08:41.279
Yes they are.

01:08:41.281 --> 01:08:45.085
They practically jumped at the opportunity.
But they are a little extreme though.

01:08:45.086 --> 01:08:47.051
We're did you get these guys?

01:08:47.053 --> 01:08:49.256
Few of our boys, a couple
I know personally,

01:08:49.256 --> 01:08:53.028
They have a knack for extreme skydiving, so
they just called in a favor for the prop.

01:08:53.828 --> 01:08:55.528
Excellent Private. Excellent!

01:08:55.529 --> 01:08:56.629
Thank you Sir!

01:09:11.212 --> 01:09:13.752
This is red wing leader.
2 minutes out.

01:09:18.551 --> 01:09:19.791
Roger that.

01:09:23.591 --> 01:09:24.756
Okie dokie.

01:09:24.758 --> 01:09:27.527
I found this parachute
and this raft.

01:09:27.528 --> 01:09:29.363
We're gonna take this parachute...

01:09:30.162 --> 01:09:35.536
connect it to the raft and then we're
all gonna ride down to the ocean.

01:09:35.537 --> 01:09:37.938
And then we're gonna paddle
like hell to safety.

01:09:41.542 --> 01:09:44.478
Not everybody can fit
on that raft Jim.

01:09:44.479 --> 01:09:46.279
We're gonna get women
and kid off first.

01:10:02.696 --> 01:10:04.965
OK.

01:10:04.966 --> 01:10:09.970
I want all the women, and little Tony follow
me to the cargo. We're getting off this bird!

01:10:11.271 --> 01:10:13.039
You sure this is gonna work?

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.507
I'll let you know.

01:10:14.508 --> 01:10:17.011
I don't think so.

01:10:17.811 --> 01:10:22.016
If anybody is getting
off this plane... it's me!

01:10:25.151 --> 01:10:27.753
Crieger! Crieger! Stop it!

01:10:27.754 --> 01:10:28.855
Stop!

01:10:30.992 --> 01:10:32.326
Everybody get down!

01:11:08.096 --> 01:11:10.202
One more step...

01:11:22.543 --> 01:11:25.247
You never could see
things my way right?

01:12:33.047 --> 01:12:35.018
Tony Macaroni.

01:12:37.818 --> 01:12:40.686
You're still taking care of mommy?

01:12:40.687 --> 01:12:43.362
We don't want anything
to happen to her, right?

01:12:48.162 --> 01:12:52.380
I...I have a grandson...

01:12:54.006 --> 01:12:56.237
about the same age as you.

01:12:57.738 --> 01:13:03.408
He always holds my hand...
even when I go to sleep.

01:13:03.409 --> 01:13:08.622
I don't know why,
but he always does.

01:13:16.022 --> 01:13:18.737
Boo-ya.

01:13:30.537 --> 01:13:36.180
I... I'm going to rest for...
for a little while, OK?

01:13:53.159 --> 01:13:54.666
Holy mother of...

01:13:58.466 --> 01:13:59.566
They're huge!

01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:02.374
This is red wing leader.
All fighters check in.

01:14:02.375 --> 01:14:03.603
Red Wing 1, standing by.

01:14:03.604 --> 01:14:05.337
Red Wing 3, standing by.

01:14:05.338 --> 01:14:07.542
Red Wing 5, standing by.

01:14:09.376 --> 01:14:11.345
OK. Gotta get in gotta move fast!

01:14:11.346 --> 01:14:13.282
It's your party Red wing leader.

01:14:15.082 --> 01:14:18.122
Roger that. Men... lock on their cores.
Red Wings, going in hot!

01:14:28.595 --> 01:14:30.363
Crieger's taken the raft.

01:14:30.364 --> 01:14:31.967
Let him.

01:14:45.413 --> 01:14:46.849
Look!

01:14:48.649 --> 01:14:49.749
Yes!

01:14:56.257 --> 01:14:58.725
Ladies and Gentlemen
help has arrived!

01:14:58.726 --> 01:15:01.046
Everybody hand on! This is
going to get really bumpy.

01:15:01.829 --> 01:15:03.564
Strap in.

01:15:04.364 --> 01:15:05.601
You good?

01:15:08.401 --> 01:15:09.501
Bring it on.

01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:12.976
Red Wings, engage!

01:15:15.776 --> 01:15:17.475
They're everywhere.

01:15:17.476 --> 01:15:18.949
I'm going in.

01:15:22.749 --> 01:15:24.420
Come on! Open wide!

01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:28.787
Dammit Red Wings,
lay down the fire!

01:15:28.788 --> 01:15:31.792
Roger that! Red Wing 3, box 1!

01:15:31.793 --> 01:15:34.664
Red Wing 5, box 2!

01:15:37.464 --> 01:15:38.565
Dammit!

01:15:39.365 --> 01:15:40.805
I can't get a clear shot at it.

01:15:45.338 --> 01:15:47.439
The target is set!

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:49.043
I can't see 'em.

01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:55.881
We're losing men left and right.

01:15:55.882 --> 01:15:58.154
Wider missiles. Wider Missiles.

01:16:00.954 --> 01:16:03.457
Red Wing leader, lady down
cover fire for that plane.

01:16:03.458 --> 01:16:05.757
I'm sending evac with
a few firecrackers.

01:16:05.758 --> 01:16:09.272
Get on the comm and tell those guys to ready
explosives to be stuffed in to that plane.

01:16:09.273 --> 01:16:10.764
What are you nuts?

01:16:10.765 --> 01:16:12.800
Yeah.

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:15.467
Alright, I'm on it.

01:16:15.468 --> 01:16:17.537
You head him, let's plow the road!

01:16:31.552 --> 01:16:35.153
Fly & Tow, Fly & Tow!
This is base, come in?

01:16:35.154 --> 01:16:36.489
Read you, Base.

01:16:36.490 --> 01:16:38.123
Do you have any
explosives on board?

01:16:38.124 --> 01:16:40.318
That's an affirmative! Never
leave home with out them.

01:16:40.319 --> 01:16:43.597
Good! I think they
may come in handy.

01:16:44.397 --> 01:16:46.132
This is gonna be close!

01:16:46.133 --> 01:16:47.568
Look out!

01:16:55.476 --> 01:16:59.884
I'm hit! I'm hit! Red
Wing 3, ejecting!

01:17:03.684 --> 01:17:06.586
I'm hit! I'm going down!
I'm going down!

01:17:06.587 --> 01:17:09.122
Eject, dammit, eject!

01:17:11.123 --> 01:17:12.558
Oh I miss Los Angeles.

01:17:12.559 --> 01:17:14.159
We're that damn Evac?

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:16.362
There're getting killed out there!

01:17:16.363 --> 01:17:19.077
Fly & Tow, Fly & Tow! Get your asses
in there now! What's your eta?

01:17:19.078 --> 01:17:22.402
ETA is 1 minute, Control,
ready and packing!

01:17:22.403 --> 01:17:23.503
Roger that!

01:17:23.837 --> 01:17:25.917
Red Wing Leader, you have
less than one minute!

01:17:33.381 --> 01:17:35.631
Times up.

01:18:18.492 --> 01:18:20.426
Oh... my...

01:18:20.427 --> 01:18:22.542
You are a big bitch.

01:19:09.109 --> 01:19:10.929
Yudo time to fly!

01:19:28.729 --> 01:19:31.296
Help is here! But
what are they doing?

01:19:31.297 --> 01:19:33.667
They're towing you out of there!

01:19:33.668 --> 01:19:34.734
What?

01:19:34.735 --> 01:19:36.538
Is that safe?

01:19:38.338 --> 01:19:41.011
We have the package! Towing now!

01:19:50.016 --> 01:19:52.787
There's too much wind
resistance on that plane.

01:19:53.587 --> 01:19:54.908
We're gonna have to drop it.

01:19:55.021 --> 01:19:56.256
Hurry you asses up!

01:19:57.056 --> 01:19:58.692
Yes Sir!

01:19:59.492 --> 01:20:00.592
We're going in again!

01:20:00.961 --> 01:20:03.462
Get every soul of that plane!

01:20:09.102 --> 01:20:12.305
Hey! Hey! take my son!

01:20:12.306 --> 01:20:13.916
Go go go!

01:20:21.716 --> 01:20:24.993
Receiving our 1st 2 passengers.

01:20:41.935 --> 01:20:43.475
Go! Go! Go! Get them out now!

01:20:49.275 --> 01:20:52.422
Control! We can't stay
here much longer!

01:21:02.222 --> 01:21:03.322
Go go go!

01:21:04.056 --> 01:21:06.458
Get back on board now!

01:21:06.459 --> 01:21:07.595
What's in the bag?

01:21:09.395 --> 01:21:12.631
Enough explosives to blow this
bastard back to where it came from!

01:21:12.632 --> 01:21:14.100
Are you guys crazy?

01:21:14.101 --> 01:21:16.902
- We've been told!
- That's everybody come on!

01:21:16.903 --> 01:21:20.640
No we're not leaving
without Rick. Rick!

01:21:20.641 --> 01:21:22.176
We have to go ma'am.

01:21:22.976 --> 01:21:25.078
I'll be right back!

01:21:25.079 --> 01:21:26.847
Rita!

01:21:28.647 --> 01:21:31.756
Rick, we need to go...

01:21:35.556 --> 01:21:36.656
It's not that bad.

01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:43.095
We need to go. They're
getting us out of here.

01:21:43.096 --> 01:21:45.764
Come on, you two,
we need to go now!

01:21:45.765 --> 01:21:47.034
We're taking him with us!

01:21:48.834 --> 01:21:50.240
We're taking him with us!

01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:59.545
You don't have to.
You don't have to. It's OK.

01:21:59.546 --> 01:22:00.646
It's OK.

01:22:24.570 --> 01:22:25.670
Go.

01:22:26.172 --> 01:22:27.875
You've got a plane to catch.

01:22:28.675 --> 01:22:30.877
I'm sorry.

01:22:30.878 --> 01:22:32.412
- I'm sorry
- It's OK.

01:22:32.413 --> 01:22:37.685
I'm Sorry. I'm Sorry. I'm Sorry.

01:22:39.485 --> 01:22:42.186
We've loaded the plane with
200 pounds of explosives.

01:22:42.187 --> 01:22:45.190
You have to hit the
center of the volcano.

01:22:45.191 --> 01:22:46.257
OK.

01:22:46.258 --> 01:22:47.628
Good Luck.

01:22:55.502 --> 01:22:57.269
I'm a pilot.

01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:58.370
I can fly.

01:23:01.039 --> 01:23:02.239
It's time to go! Come on!

01:23:02.842 --> 01:23:04.011
It's time to go!

01:23:04.811 --> 01:23:07.948
Where's Rick?

01:23:08.748 --> 01:23:10.150
Get him out of here! Ready?

01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:12.688
Yeah yeah yeah.

01:23:15.488 --> 01:23:16.899
The plane is cleared.

01:23:25.699 --> 01:23:27.637
I'm not going anywhere.

01:23:36.510 --> 01:23:37.576
Good Luck son.

01:23:37.577 --> 01:23:39.118
Red Wings, pull out.

01:23:44.918 --> 01:23:48.960
Control, I've got an incoming
bogey. He's not gonna make it.

01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:55.832
I'm going in.

01:24:13.547 --> 01:24:14.992
Come on!

01:24:25.792 --> 01:24:31.233
Come on!!!

01:24:51.418 --> 01:24:53.621
He did it!

01:24:54.421 --> 01:24:55.355
He did it!

01:24:55.356 --> 01:24:56.523
Yes!

01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:02.096
- Blow it up!
- No blow it up.

01:25:02.122 --> 01:25:03.645
That's enough explosions for today.

01:25:03.829 --> 01:25:05.900
I'm sorry I'm excited.

01:25:10.803 --> 01:25:12.908
Sergeant congratulations!

01:25:15.708 --> 01:25:17.943
Yeah. We did it!

01:25:17.944 --> 01:25:19.347
We did it.

01:25:21.147 --> 01:25:23.481
Hawaii wasn't alone
experiencing volcanic activity.

01:25:23.482 --> 01:25:26.076
Mt. Vesuvius has reportedly erupted
wiping out Pompeii for good.

01:25:26.077 --> 01:25:26.987
Tully.

01:25:27.787 --> 01:25:29.689
Hell of a job soldier.

01:25:29.690 --> 01:25:31.590
Hell of a job.

01:25:31.591 --> 01:25:33.828
Colonel Rhyker would be proud.

01:25:34.628 --> 01:25:36.695
Thank you sir.

01:25:36.696 --> 01:25:37.796
No.

01:25:38.431 --> 01:25:41.773
Thank you... Sergeant.

01:25:46.573 --> 01:25:47.673
Carry on sergeant.

01:25:47.841 --> 01:25:49.746
Yes, sir.

01:26:23.309 --> 01:26:25.216
I'll never forget him.

01:26:30.016 --> 01:26:32.000
Neither will I.
