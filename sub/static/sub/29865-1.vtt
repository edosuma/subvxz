02:21.020 --> 02:21.820
Hello.

02:21.980 --> 02:25.460
No, now it's not the best time.
Can I call you back later?

02:25.860 --> 02:28.460
Yes. It's in the middle
of nowhere, yeah.

02:29.660 --> 02:32.780
Mom.
It's always the same question.

02:33.260 --> 02:35.100
I already told
you where it was.

02:35.180 --> 02:37.620
It's Upstate New York,
near Springwell.

02:38.860 --> 02:39.740
No.

02:40.740 --> 02:44.380
No, no, it's not in ruins, no.
It just needs a little fixing up.

02:44.460 --> 02:45.900
Give her a big kiss.

02:46.260 --> 02:48.020
Listen, we still have a lot
of unpacking to do.

02:48.020 --> 02:50.580
I'll call you back later,
I promise, okay?

02:51.500 --> 02:55.780
Bye, Mom.

02:56.940 --> 02:58.780
So when's the queen
mom paying us a visit?

02:58.860 --> 03:00.660
Oh, don't hold
your breath.

03:02.180 --> 03:03.300
Hey, june bug.

03:04.020 --> 03:05.340
Hey. Come here.
Come here.

03:07.860 --> 03:09.180
It's gonna be fine.

03:10.180 --> 03:11.380
I promise.

03:15.380 --> 03:16.380
Look.

03:17.580 --> 03:18.380
Home.

03:18.380 --> 03:19.580
Yeah.

03:20.220 --> 03:21.420
Sweet home.

03:34.580 --> 03:35.900
Kate!

03:37.980 --> 03:40.260
- Okay, I'm coming.
- Okay. Okay.

04:01.900 --> 04:03.180
Kate?

04:08.580 --> 04:09.540
Oh shit.

04:09.900 --> 04:11.100
Are you crazy?

04:11.340 --> 04:13.660
Come here you.
You gave me a heart attack.

04:41.780 --> 04:44.260
What are you doing?
I said I'll handle this.

04:44.260 --> 04:45.780
Like next month
or something?

04:46.100 --> 04:47.100
What that
supposed to mean?

04:49.100 --> 04:51.540
Means you can start drawing
and then nothing else will mater.

04:51.540 --> 04:54.220
- Hey.
- What?

04:55.700 --> 04:58.060
- I wasn't nagging you.
- Come on.

04:58.620 --> 05:00.020
Are you serious?

05:10.420 --> 05:13.140
Why did I have to
fall in love with an artist?

05:18.900 --> 05:22.900
Well, you can't say
your mom didn't warn you.

05:48.940 --> 05:49.900
Hey.

06:11.420 --> 06:12.380
Hey!

06:12.540 --> 06:15.180
It's faster than the stairs.
Sorry.

07:48.260 --> 07:49.500
Kate!

08:12.620 --> 08:14.060
What's going on?

08:18.500 --> 08:19.620
Shit.

08:21.380 --> 08:23.540
I'm calling the
power company.

08:41.180 --> 08:42.580
We did it.

08:48.260 --> 08:50.140
You'll become a great painter.

08:50.300 --> 08:53.420
And I'll be a
perfect housewife.

08:53.900 --> 08:56.420
Slowly turning into fat Carol.

08:57.420 --> 09:00.300
- I will love you fat.
- Yeah, sure.

09:03.940 --> 09:06.140
You know you should
grow a longer beard.

09:06.740 --> 09:08.700
Genius painters
all have beards.

09:15.820 --> 09:16.820
What?

09:20.860 --> 09:23.980
- My God, you're such a wimp.
- What? I'm not a wimp.

09:24.420 --> 09:26.380
I know all about life
in the wilderness.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.820
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

09:27.940 --> 09:30.460
Like Belgium has anything
remotely wild about it.

09:31.300 --> 09:33.820
Hey, we make close to a
thousand different beers.

09:33.820 --> 09:35.300
I say that's pretty wild.

09:36.380 --> 09:39.220
Oh my God.
What have you dragged me into.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.300
Now I'm stuck
here with the city boy.

09:43.460 --> 09:45.300
Come here, you farm girl.

09:47.020 --> 09:49.460
- I'll show you farm girl.
- You'll show me farm girl?

09:49.660 --> 09:51.140
Show me farm girl.

09:58.220 --> 10:01.580
All you need to do is
take that first step.

10:02.460 --> 10:04.420
Yeah, I know.

10:06.020 --> 10:07.140
Do it.

10:14.060 --> 10:15.100
Honey.

10:16.340 --> 10:19.340
- Do we have plans of the house?
- Yeah, I think so.

10:19.700 --> 10:21.300
- Hello, Andre.
- Hey, Katerina.

10:21.300 --> 10:22.460
I'm going to cut to the chase.

10:22.740 --> 10:25.940
You're my best translator,
and I need this for yesterday.

10:26.140 --> 10:29.100
- Flatter will get you everywhere.
- I know I'm asking a lot.

10:29.340 --> 10:31.300
Yeah, and paying very little.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.780
2 weeks?

10:34.780 --> 10:37.020
I can't do
that in 2 weeks.

10:37.860 --> 10:40.500
I need more time,
not money.

10:41.300 --> 10:42.260
I'm not sure.

10:52.940 --> 10:53.860
Matt?

10:54.020 --> 10:55.980
The guy from the
power company is here.

10:56.700 --> 10:57.780
Jesus.

11:08.100 --> 11:09.460
Here it is.

11:10.060 --> 11:13.900
- Holy Mary Mother of God.
- I know.

11:16.420 --> 11:17.620
What?

11:18.500 --> 11:20.660
This thing is older
than my grandma.

11:21.420 --> 11:24.300
- Is it causing the surges?
- Could be.

11:25.420 --> 11:27.060
Can you do anything about it?

11:29.420 --> 11:31.820
I have never seen
anything like it.

11:41.420 --> 11:43.460
I guess that you're
not from these parts?

11:43.700 --> 11:46.500
No, we just moved
down from New York.

11:46.620 --> 11:49.300
- And before that?
- Europe.

11:50.140 --> 11:53.980
You know I was really surprised when
they told me somebody finally bought this place.

11:54.420 --> 11:56.900
And again, it was
a long time ago.

11:58.860 --> 12:00.460
What was a long time ago?

12:00.820 --> 12:04.340
The previous owners.
They got killed in this house.

12:05.340 --> 12:06.220
You know?

12:06.980 --> 12:09.060
Shit, nobody told you?

12:11.940 --> 12:14.380
Listen, if I was you,
I wouldn't touch it.

12:14.860 --> 12:16.580
But I'll get you
an estimate when I can.

12:17.060 --> 12:18.180
Well, good luck.

12:39.380 --> 12:40.500
<i>House of Blood.</i>

12:41.180 --> 12:43.580
<i>Brutal slaying of 2 in
Carroll County.</i>

12:44.100 --> 12:48.460
<i>Two people were found dead in their home
yesterday morning near Durham, police said in a statement.</i>

12:49.140 --> 12:51.500
<i>The couple, identified as
Paul and Medeline Shaeffer</i>

12:51.500 --> 12:54.380
<i>were found by Mr. Robert Korby.</i>

13:24.860 --> 13:27.940
<i>The identity of the
suspect remains unknown.</i>

14:14.180 --> 14:16.220
God, I need another bottle.

14:56.780 --> 14:57.820
Matt?

15:20.020 --> 15:21.620
Where did you
get all this stuff?

15:22.180 --> 15:23.220
Honey!

15:23.940 --> 15:26.740
The real Van Gogh, 1889.

15:27.180 --> 15:28.140
Yeah, sure.

15:30.820 --> 15:33.260
"Apples", by Paul Cézanne.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.420
Matt? Are you
high or something?

15:37.660 --> 15:38.660
Maybe.

15:39.540 --> 15:42.300
Honey.
What do you need most in the world?

15:42.460 --> 15:45.340
There's nothing I need.
A better job?

15:45.340 --> 15:47.300
No, name a thing.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.340
Come on, there's gotta
be something, anything.

15:51.300 --> 15:52.900
Please, do it for me.

15:53.300 --> 15:54.740
I want a thousand dollars.

15:58.100 --> 15:59.740
Why didn't I think of that.

16:03.060 --> 16:04.220
Okay, okay, okay.

16:24.660 --> 16:25.740
Are these fake?

16:26.660 --> 16:27.900
Does it look fake?

16:30.660 --> 16:32.340
Where did you find this?

16:32.820 --> 16:34.060
Here.

16:34.740 --> 16:36.180
How did it get here?

16:36.380 --> 16:40.140
Like everything else, it just...
got here.

16:40.380 --> 16:42.060
Fine, let's see how
far I can take this.

16:42.540 --> 16:44.020
What if I asked
for more?

16:46.020 --> 16:48.700
- Do it.
- Ten thousand?

16:49.100 --> 16:52.220
- Make it a hundred thousand.
- Sure, why not a million?

16:52.340 --> 16:53.540
Ask for it.

16:54.460 --> 16:55.420
Alright.

16:56.980 --> 16:58.620
I want a million dollars.

17:12.020 --> 17:13.980
Hey, hey, hey.

17:14.620 --> 17:16.060
This is fucking scary, Matt.

17:16.220 --> 17:18.540
Yes it is, but I think
we should enjoy it.

17:21.100 --> 17:23.980
- I've got a bad feeling.
- June bug, come on.

17:25.140 --> 17:26.220
Let's just...

17:28.180 --> 17:29.540
Have fun.

17:33.380 --> 17:35.820
Hey, come on.

17:38.540 --> 17:40.100
Let's have some fun.

17:43.220 --> 17:45.580
I want the best
champagne in the world.

17:45.580 --> 17:47.060
Tons of champagne.

17:48.340 --> 17:49.460
It's so funny.

17:49.980 --> 17:52.980
I want money,
and more money!

17:55.740 --> 17:56.700
I want money!

17:59.380 --> 18:01.060
I wanna be a princess.

18:11.100 --> 18:14.460
I just awarded my
brilliant career as a translator.

18:15.420 --> 18:16.860
That's my girl.

19:34.780 --> 19:36.140
Is this caviar?

19:36.180 --> 19:39.380
Beluga, my dear.
The best of caviars.

19:42.340 --> 19:44.220
You are so greedy.

20:05.860 --> 20:08.420
How does it work?

20:10.380 --> 20:13.140
What do you want me to say?
It's like, I don't know.

20:15.660 --> 20:18.700
Computer?
Who cares how it works.

20:19.180 --> 20:22.060
You just... use it.

20:29.580 --> 20:31.820
Yeah, but computers
can get bugs.

20:41.420 --> 20:43.020
<i>♪ God is everywhere. ♪</i>

20:56.940 --> 20:57.900
<i>♪ Christ.  ♪</i>

20:58.900 --> 21:00.300

21:04.820 --> 21:08.660

it's my only advice. ♪</i>

22:16.460 --> 22:17.860
Kate?

22:50.940 --> 22:53.340
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:56.060 --> 22:57.780
Where is the necklace
you asked for?

22:58.780 --> 22:59.660
I don't know.

23:01.660 --> 23:03.660
Anyway, it was just a figment.

23:05.100 --> 23:06.820
I can always get another.

23:10.500 --> 23:12.140
And another.

23:14.420 --> 23:17.180
And... another.

23:20.020 --> 23:22.300
And... another!

23:38.220 --> 23:39.780
- Don't open them.
- What?

23:40.380 --> 23:43.100
- No peeking.
- This is so mysterious.

23:43.220 --> 23:44.340
Come on, come on.

23:47.020 --> 23:47.860
Open them.

23:54.740 --> 23:56.220
Let's give it another try.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.980
Honey, remember what
the doctor said.

24:02.660 --> 24:04.700
There's nothing
wrong with you.

24:04.900 --> 24:06.420
There's nothing
wrong with me.

24:07.860 --> 24:09.980
There's no reason
we can't have children.

24:11.740 --> 24:13.140
The doctors...

24:14.940 --> 24:17.420
have no idea what
they are talking about.

24:19.260 --> 24:21.100
We already tried twice.

24:24.100 --> 24:25.620
Both babies died.

24:26.380 --> 24:28.780
In here, remember?

24:29.300 --> 24:32.900
It happens to millions
of couples.

24:33.060 --> 24:34.460
It happened to us.

24:35.180 --> 24:35.980
To me.

24:43.700 --> 24:45.260
I can't do this again.

24:53.340 --> 24:54.380
Kate.

24:55.300 --> 24:56.220
Kate.

25:29.740 --> 25:31.180
I'm going for a ride.

26:21.220 --> 26:22.300
Kate?

26:24.620 --> 26:25.660
Hello.

26:29.020 --> 26:29.980
Kate?

26:52.900 --> 26:54.140
Who's baby is this?

26:59.860 --> 27:02.260
Look, it's a boy.

27:09.940 --> 27:11.660
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

27:17.180 --> 27:20.020
- What? You wanted it.
- No like this.

27:20.460 --> 27:22.740
- There was no other way.
- Yes, there was.

27:22.820 --> 27:25.020
- Not for us.
- We could've tried again.

27:25.060 --> 27:27.100
- What, and failed again?
- You don't know that.

27:28.420 --> 27:29.580
I took a shortcut.

27:29.580 --> 27:31.500
A shortcut?
Are you out of your...

27:32.340 --> 27:34.100
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

27:34.580 --> 27:36.940
You used the room
to make a baby.

27:36.940 --> 27:38.900
Yes, yes I did.

27:40.940 --> 27:42.700
Well, now do what
you need to do.

27:43.580 --> 27:44.980
What's that
supposed to mean?

27:44.980 --> 27:47.980
You know what it means.
We're not keeping it.

27:51.620 --> 27:52.940
You can't be serious.

27:54.060 --> 27:55.540
Kate, you are not...

27:56.540 --> 27:57.620
Kate.

28:00.420 --> 28:03.340
Kate, this is wrong.

28:21.660 --> 28:22.740
Come on.

28:39.940 --> 28:41.580
Say the words.

28:47.820 --> 28:50.020
I don't know.
What do I say?

28:51.060 --> 28:52.580
Say anything.

28:53.580 --> 28:55.060
Say...

28:57.140 --> 28:58.100
You want it...

28:59.220 --> 29:00.740
You want it gone.

29:09.700 --> 29:12.060
It's alright,
I'll do it.

29:12.620 --> 29:13.540
I'll do it.

30:04.820 --> 30:06.380
Come on, do something!

30:06.540 --> 30:08.660
What do you want me to do?
It's the middle of the night.

30:09.060 --> 30:10.660
So go to the room!

30:15.540 --> 30:18.660
I want a baby's
bottle with milk.

30:23.740 --> 30:26.700
Yeah, thank you.

30:31.580 --> 30:32.700
He wouldn't wait.

30:35.100 --> 30:36.180
How did you...

30:36.620 --> 30:39.220
I don't know,
it just works.

30:54.980 --> 30:57.060
Aren't you a lousy boy.

30:57.740 --> 30:58.500
Yeah.

30:59.740 --> 31:00.660
What?

31:01.420 --> 31:02.620
What was that?

32:01.980 --> 32:03.900
- Yes?
- Hi.

32:04.900 --> 32:08.580
- What patient do you wish to see?
- John Doe.

32:11.300 --> 32:12.860
You want to see John Doe?

32:13.540 --> 32:14.700
The John Doe?

32:15.260 --> 32:18.180
- How many do you have?
- Just the one.

32:19.300 --> 32:20.740
So, what's the problem?

32:20.900 --> 32:23.420
When you want to see
someone at a psychiatric ward

32:23.420 --> 32:25.660
you have to be on that person's
approved visiting list.

32:26.100 --> 32:27.740
John Doe has no list.

32:27.740 --> 32:29.780
You mean he hasn't
received a single visit?

32:29.900 --> 32:32.060
- In 45 years?
- Reporters.

32:33.060 --> 32:34.660
Are you a reporter?

32:35.220 --> 32:36.220
Sure.

33:22.100 --> 33:23.540
You're no reporter.

33:29.660 --> 33:31.020
My name is Matt DeWitt.

33:32.500 --> 33:34.260
I live in a Springwell house.

33:45.460 --> 33:47.740
I've been waiting a
long time for this.

33:48.620 --> 33:49.820
For you.

33:52.300 --> 33:53.580
How do you like it?

33:54.380 --> 33:55.660
Do you know about it?

33:56.940 --> 33:58.260
You having fun?

34:01.820 --> 34:03.100
Come on.

34:04.860 --> 34:06.500
Nice clothes.

34:08.060 --> 34:09.300
Great food.

34:10.460 --> 34:13.660
Maybe some jewelry,
some cash?

34:15.460 --> 34:17.300
Pussy, maybe?

34:22.300 --> 34:25.100
- What do you want from me?
- Why did you kill the Shaeffers?

34:26.500 --> 34:28.060
It was the only way.

34:29.180 --> 34:30.620
I need answers.

34:31.940 --> 34:33.700
What you need is advice.

34:35.500 --> 34:37.100
Forget about the room.

34:38.340 --> 34:42.220
Get out of the house, and do that
now, before it's too late.

34:45.260 --> 34:47.060
No, but you
won't, will ya?

34:49.380 --> 34:51.460
I can see it.
I know your kind.

34:51.580 --> 34:54.100
- My kind?
- Yeah, creatures of need.

34:54.420 --> 34:57.260
You crave and you crave
and you crave and then...

34:59.380 --> 35:00.580
you die.

35:02.340 --> 35:04.540
- And you're different?
- Oh, yeah.

35:05.140 --> 35:07.220
In more ways than
you can imagine.

35:09.340 --> 35:13.420
Hey, come here,
let me tell you something.

35:16.980 --> 35:21.660
The only thing more dangerous than
a person who can't get what they want

35:22.860 --> 35:24.860
is the person who
gets whatever they want.

35:41.660 --> 35:42.940
Forty bucks, please.

37:15.460 --> 37:16.980
Yes, you are a little bug.

37:22.580 --> 37:23.860
It's okay, it's okay.

37:24.940 --> 37:27.860
Yeah, let's go see.

37:28.140 --> 37:30.620
Let's go see what's going on.

37:30.660 --> 37:32.180
Stop it, stop it!

37:32.460 --> 37:34.580
Is this gonna hurt the baby?

37:34.780 --> 37:36.740
I'm trying to figure
out how it works.

37:37.140 --> 37:39.140
Now we suddenly
need to know?

37:39.900 --> 37:40.820
I do.

39:04.420 --> 39:05.500
Where are you going?

39:06.260 --> 39:07.620
- For breath of air.
- No.

39:08.100 --> 39:09.340
It's not safe.

39:10.060 --> 39:11.820
- What are you talking about?
- Kate.

39:13.580 --> 39:14.700
Trust me.

39:15.700 --> 39:16.980
I have my reasons.

39:17.500 --> 39:18.980
What reasons?

39:19.820 --> 39:20.820
Matt.

39:20.980 --> 39:22.220
What reasons?

39:25.380 --> 39:26.580
Look at you.

39:53.620 --> 39:55.020
Matt!

40:07.220 --> 40:09.620
Matt!

41:38.900 --> 41:40.620
You know what's going on,
don't you?

41:41.300 --> 41:42.660
Not for sure.

41:47.740 --> 41:49.140
Well, you know something.

41:50.980 --> 41:52.420
There is this man.

41:54.820 --> 41:56.340
He knows about the room.

41:56.500 --> 41:57.380
Who?

41:59.900 --> 42:02.140
- A Mr. John Doe.
- Come on, that's not funny!

42:02.140 --> 42:05.140
- Oh, forget it.
- Matt, please.

42:05.820 --> 42:07.140
Kate, the point is...

42:07.540 --> 42:11.380
The room makes
things, okay?

42:11.660 --> 42:13.100
That's what it does, it's like...

42:13.580 --> 42:15.260
A giant 3D printer.

42:15.540 --> 42:18.340
It makes stuff,
in a one condition.

42:18.900 --> 42:23.260
Which is that you never
take that stuff outdoors.

42:25.060 --> 42:27.980
- And if you do...
- What, it ages?

42:28.460 --> 42:29.980
And it turns to dust.

42:32.100 --> 42:35.780
But...
The baby is not a thing.

42:38.660 --> 42:39.980
Yes it is.

42:42.540 --> 42:46.100
It's a thing made
of flesh and bones.

42:48.300 --> 42:49.740
A soul.

43:00.820 --> 43:01.900
Hi.

43:11.700 --> 43:12.820
It's alright.

43:19.500 --> 43:21.060
It's alright.

43:59.420 --> 44:01.220
Come on, concentrate.

44:01.980 --> 44:04.420
<i> Tom and Katie... </i>

44:05.900 --> 44:08.940
<i> Tom and Katie go camping. </i>

44:08.940 --> 44:09.620
Good.

44:09.740 --> 44:11.020
What's camping?

44:11.100 --> 44:14.060
It's when you live a tent,
when you are on vacation.

44:14.260 --> 44:16.940
- Can I go for camping?
- No, you can't.

44:17.500 --> 44:19.580
For the same reason
you can't answer the door.

44:19.940 --> 44:21.220
You're sick, my love.

44:22.060 --> 44:25.060
I don't feel sick,
not germ sick.

44:25.180 --> 44:28.300
Well, that because you are
in this house.

44:28.740 --> 44:30.100
It protects you.

44:30.860 --> 44:34.340
But if you go outside,
the germs will get you.

44:34.700 --> 44:36.700
There are no
germs in this house?

44:37.020 --> 44:38.220
Only good germs.

44:39.500 --> 44:41.780
- I wanna go camping.
- Will see.

44:42.540 --> 44:43.340
Now.

44:43.820 --> 44:46.300
<i>Oh my, says Katie.</i>

44:46.300 --> 44:49.500
<i> I forgot my bathing...</i>

44:50.020 --> 44:50.980
Cat.

44:52.540 --> 44:54.860
- There's no such thing as a bathing cat.
- Yes, there is.

44:54.860 --> 44:57.820
Take a cat, throw it in a tab,
that's a bathing cat.

44:57.940 --> 44:59.900
Okay, Shane, I'm
not in the mood.

45:01.460 --> 45:04.780
It's a "P", so it's bathing...

45:05.100 --> 45:05.900
Cat.

45:07.020 --> 45:09.980
It's cap, bathing cap.

45:10.060 --> 45:12.020
- Say it.
- Bathing cat.

45:12.100 --> 45:14.980
- Enough.
- Cat, cat, cat.

45:14.980 --> 45:17.500
- Stop that.
- Cat, cat, cat.

45:17.500 --> 45:18.660
Stop it, right now!

45:18.660 --> 45:19.980
Cat!

45:21.500 --> 45:22.700
Cat!

45:24.540 --> 45:25.940
You go pick those up.

45:26.660 --> 45:27.900
Right now, Shane!

45:50.900 --> 45:51.980
Shane.

45:52.620 --> 45:54.140
Breakfast's ready.

46:09.180 --> 46:09.900
Eat.

46:10.260 --> 46:11.860
Come on, eat your eggs.

46:15.900 --> 46:18.620
Shane, you come back here
and finish your breakfast.

46:19.660 --> 46:20.660
Now.

46:32.620 --> 46:34.300
- Good morning, Ma'am.
- Good morning.

46:37.380 --> 46:39.260
- Thank you.
- Here you go, have a nice day.

46:45.420 --> 46:47.300
Matt, delivery.

47:53.180 --> 47:54.060
Shane!

47:56.020 --> 47:57.260
What's got into you?

47:57.540 --> 47:59.220
- What's got into you!
- What happened?

48:02.020 --> 48:03.180
Okay, it's okay.

48:03.660 --> 48:04.460
Come.

48:07.900 --> 48:09.020
It's okay.

48:20.260 --> 48:21.300
Kate.

48:22.940 --> 48:23.980
Hey!

48:25.220 --> 48:26.500
I'm not doing this.

48:26.860 --> 48:28.060
You don't like it?

48:28.100 --> 48:30.500
Feel free to leave
anytime you want!

49:27.900 --> 49:29.260
Stop it, please.

49:30.300 --> 49:31.620
You'll hurt your teeth.

50:17.980 --> 50:19.260
I love you.

50:20.780 --> 50:22.220
Do you love me?

50:23.340 --> 50:25.140
Of course I do.

50:26.260 --> 50:27.900
Can I sleep with you?

50:41.980 --> 50:44.300
I want to be with you forever.

50:44.300 --> 50:46.980
Do you want to be
with me forever too?

50:46.980 --> 50:48.220
Of course I do.

50:50.020 --> 50:51.260
Of course.

50:53.060 --> 50:55.300
Come here, come here.

51:38.300 --> 51:39.820
What are you doing in here?

51:47.740 --> 51:50.900
What happened?
How long are you gonna be doing this?

51:50.940 --> 51:52.780
These ridiculous hermit routine.

51:53.460 --> 51:56.580
I told you he can not come in here.
This is my room.

51:56.580 --> 51:59.420
Why do you have to do this?
He's just a baby.

51:59.420 --> 52:01.540
No, he's not,
he's a figment.

52:01.580 --> 52:04.660
For fuck sake, I'm not
having this conversation again.

53:19.740 --> 53:20.620
Kate

53:20.620 --> 53:21.860
- Kate.
- What?

53:21.860 --> 53:23.860
- Did you do this?
- What time is it?

53:23.860 --> 53:25.620
- Did you?
- No.

54:14.300 --> 54:15.860
Shane.

54:15.860 --> 54:17.100
Did you do this?

54:20.500 --> 54:21.980
This is amazing.

54:39.300 --> 54:40.380
Matt!

54:40.660 --> 54:42.100
What's the matter with you?

54:42.860 --> 54:43.900
Stop!

54:44.860 --> 54:47.260
You do not go in there,
do you understand?

54:48.060 --> 54:49.180
Leave him alone.

54:52.940 --> 54:54.740
I'm sorry, mommy.

54:55.180 --> 54:57.980
You do it all the time,
It's not really outside.

54:58.340 --> 54:59.940
There are no germs in there.

55:16.340 --> 55:17.300
It's okay.

55:37.020 --> 55:39.100
You can't stop us from
going into the room.

55:39.420 --> 55:40.260
Watch me.

55:41.140 --> 55:44.140
Matt, he was only playing.
He didn't hurt anyone.

55:44.420 --> 55:47.700
What does it mean, Matt?
That Shane is clever?

55:48.220 --> 55:49.660
He's smarter than we are?

55:49.660 --> 55:53.020
It means, he can dream
up, I don't know...

55:53.100 --> 55:54.300
A Dragon.

55:54.660 --> 55:57.100
And a dragon will magically
surface in our home.

55:57.500 --> 55:58.780
A host of dragons.

55:58.820 --> 56:01.060
- Are you afraid of him?
- Of course I am.

56:01.620 --> 56:04.780
- And you should be too.
- But he's only a child.

56:04.780 --> 56:06.740
So he can't control
his emotions.

56:07.380 --> 56:09.980
He can get mad at you
because you wouldn't let him watch TV.

56:10.820 --> 56:13.580
He can want to
hurt you, or me.

56:13.820 --> 56:14.900
Or both of us.

56:15.860 --> 56:17.620
I'm not giving
him that option.

56:18.380 --> 56:19.300
And you should...

56:19.500 --> 56:20.420
Hello?

56:23.180 --> 56:25.340
- Hello boy.
- Yes?

56:30.220 --> 56:31.580
Who is this?

56:33.420 --> 56:34.860
You know you not allowed
to answer the phone?

56:35.020 --> 56:36.260
How did you get this number?

56:36.820 --> 56:40.500
- Who was it?
- He said his name was...

56:41.900 --> 56:43.420
John... Doe.

56:46.860 --> 56:48.620
You don't call here,
you understand?

56:48.940 --> 56:51.620
So you made a child, Matt.
Nice boy.

56:52.420 --> 56:53.900
Did you ask for it?

56:55.700 --> 56:58.420
- Who asked for it, Matt?
- My wife.

57:12.660 --> 57:14.500
What's your connection
with the room?

57:14.540 --> 57:17.060
My mother showed
it to me, next question.

57:19.060 --> 57:22.620
Is there a way to stop
the aging process?

57:23.020 --> 57:26.780
You mean the way to bring something outside
of the house so it doesn't turn to dust?

57:27.100 --> 57:28.020
Yes.

57:28.740 --> 57:31.020
Yeah, there's a way, Matt, but
I don't think you wanna know.

57:31.020 --> 57:31.980
I have to know.

57:32.540 --> 57:36.660
You know the rule, Matt - nothing created inside
the room can survive outside the house.

57:37.660 --> 57:38.780
You know that, right?

57:39.420 --> 57:40.540
Wrong.

57:42.020 --> 57:44.660
Answer this.
What did it take for man to be free?

57:44.980 --> 57:47.660
- I'm not in the mood for riddles.
- What did it take?

57:48.820 --> 57:50.980
I... I don't know.

57:50.980 --> 57:53.620
God had to die, of course.

57:53.900 --> 57:55.420
Didn't you read Nietzsche?

57:56.300 --> 57:59.900
Man wants to be free,
but first the creator must die.

58:01.020 --> 58:02.220
That's just...

58:02.940 --> 58:04.940
The natural order of
things, you know.

58:05.420 --> 58:07.180
Children outliving their parents.

58:07.180 --> 58:08.660
I don't understand.

58:09.540 --> 58:11.340
No, I think you do
understand, Matt.

58:11.820 --> 58:13.060
Think.

58:14.300 --> 58:16.620
Matt, if your wife dies,

58:17.540 --> 58:21.500
then the child she created inside the
room becomes part of this world.

58:22.060 --> 58:25.780
He's free to live
and love and...

58:26.580 --> 58:28.300
age like anyone else.

58:29.220 --> 58:30.500
He's free to be...

58:31.500 --> 58:34.620
sent to a mental institution
for the rest of his life.

58:35.620 --> 58:37.140
You're a figment too.

58:41.020 --> 58:42.380
That's why you killed them.

58:42.380 --> 58:45.740
The truth is, they
wanted me to live.

58:47.180 --> 58:49.580
So they knew
they had to die.

58:51.020 --> 58:55.340
At first, mother kills father
and then she forced me to...

58:57.900 --> 59:00.820
That was...
That was hard enough.

59:03.060 --> 59:04.780
But here's the
question for you, Matt.

59:06.700 --> 59:08.020
What are you gonna do?

59:10.140 --> 59:12.580
You want to kill the
child to save your wife?

59:14.300 --> 59:16.580
Or you want to kill your
wife to save the child?

59:17.620 --> 59:18.580
Kate?

1:00:14.420 --> 1:00:16.660
Kate, I'm officialy worried.

1:00:16.860 --> 1:00:18.820
Call me, okay?

1:00:19.700 --> 1:00:21.220
Or better you'd come home.

1:00:56.300 --> 1:00:58.500
<i>Hello, this is Kate.
Please leave a message.</i>

1:00:58.700 --> 1:00:59.700
Fuck!

1:02:05.580 --> 1:02:06.940
Where is mommy?

1:02:09.300 --> 1:02:10.300
I don't know.

1:02:11.700 --> 1:02:13.020
When she coming back?

1:02:15.300 --> 1:02:16.300
I don't know.

1:02:17.100 --> 1:02:20.140
- You don't know anything?
- That's right.

1:02:22.820 --> 1:02:24.180
What's a figment?

1:02:27.020 --> 1:02:30.020
You told mommy I was a
figment, is that bad?

1:02:30.420 --> 1:02:33.620
No, it's...
It's nothing.

1:02:33.780 --> 1:02:35.380
Forget I said that.
Come on, eat your food.

1:02:39.060 --> 1:02:40.620
You are not my dad.

1:02:42.100 --> 1:02:43.420
At least we
agree on something.

1:02:44.100 --> 1:02:47.340
Where is he?
Where is my real dad?

1:02:47.380 --> 1:02:48.820
What did you do to him?

1:02:49.180 --> 1:02:52.260
Where is my real one?
Tell me where he is.

1:02:52.260 --> 1:02:54.340
Tell me where
my real dad is!

1:02:54.420 --> 1:02:55.700
Listen, kid.

1:02:56.580 --> 1:02:58.020
You don't have a dad.

1:02:59.300 --> 1:03:00.740
You don't have a
mother either.

1:03:01.100 --> 1:03:03.500
Kate is not your mother.

1:03:04.180 --> 1:03:08.100
- Yes she is.
- No, she is not.

1:03:08.780 --> 1:03:10.300
And you are
not a real kid.

1:03:11.940 --> 1:03:13.740
You wanna know
what the figment is?

1:03:14.340 --> 1:03:16.620
It's something
that's not real.

1:03:16.780 --> 1:03:17.740
Like you.

1:03:18.900 --> 1:03:21.100
Do you know why you
are not allowed to go outside?

1:03:21.940 --> 1:03:23.260
Forget germs.

1:03:23.780 --> 1:03:28.220
If you leave this place,
you'll grow older and older,

1:03:28.260 --> 1:03:32.260
until you are nothing
but a tiny pile of dust.

1:03:32.620 --> 1:03:33.820
That's why.

1:03:34.940 --> 1:03:36.260
You're lying!

1:03:37.140 --> 1:03:38.380
You don't believe me?

1:03:40.500 --> 1:03:41.500
Stop it!

1:03:42.140 --> 1:03:43.340
Stop it!

1:03:44.620 --> 1:03:45.820
No!

1:03:46.540 --> 1:03:47.620
Go on.

1:03:48.820 --> 1:03:50.180
See what happens.

1:03:50.860 --> 1:03:52.100
Go on!

1:03:53.020 --> 1:03:57.020
Do you remember
anything before the past three months?

1:03:58.060 --> 1:04:01.380
Do you have any memory
outside of this house?

1:04:01.860 --> 1:04:04.220
Did you ever
celebrate a birthday?

1:04:05.980 --> 1:04:07.580
You're not a real person.

1:04:07.980 --> 1:04:09.300
You're an idea.

1:04:45.140 --> 1:04:47.980
Listen, Shane,
I'm sorry, okay?

1:04:56.180 --> 1:04:57.660
I'm really sorry.

1:05:09.180 --> 1:05:10.660
Will you read to me?

1:06:06.580 --> 1:06:09.220
- Where were you?
- Out.

1:06:09.380 --> 1:06:12.020
- I called.
- I know.

1:06:19.340 --> 1:06:22.900
- Listen, about what you heard on the phone...
- I don't want to talk about it.

1:06:30.980 --> 1:06:32.340
Shane's asleep.

1:06:32.340 --> 1:06:34.660
Oh, good.

1:08:26.980 --> 1:08:27.780
Matt?

1:08:28.420 --> 1:08:30.780
Matt?

1:08:38.980 --> 1:08:39.900
Shane?

1:08:40.540 --> 1:08:41.660
Shane?

1:08:42.300 --> 1:08:43.220
Kate.

1:08:52.820 --> 1:08:53.900
Oh my God.

1:09:18.060 --> 1:09:19.540
Look, Mommy.

1:09:20.180 --> 1:09:21.460
I'm big now.

1:09:22.340 --> 1:09:23.100
Shane?

1:09:32.300 --> 1:09:33.380
It's not loaded.

1:09:35.020 --> 1:09:36.940
I know where you
keep your bullets too!

1:09:38.100 --> 1:09:40.260
Shane, give me the gun.

1:09:40.260 --> 1:09:41.500
I hate you!

1:09:41.620 --> 1:09:43.100
No! No!

1:09:45.420 --> 1:09:46.980
Look at me, Shane.

1:09:48.140 --> 1:09:50.820
- You lied to me.
- To protect you.

1:09:51.820 --> 1:09:53.540
You said we'd be together.

1:09:54.860 --> 1:09:55.940
Forever.

1:09:57.460 --> 1:09:59.860
Would you like that?
Yes?

1:10:01.900 --> 1:10:03.260
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1:10:06.540 --> 1:10:07.740
It's gonna be okay.

1:10:10.460 --> 1:10:11.740
Come here.

1:10:13.540 --> 1:10:14.740
It's gonna be okay.

1:10:17.460 --> 1:10:18.500
It's okay.

1:10:26.460 --> 1:10:28.500
Stop! Stop it!

1:11:03.740 --> 1:11:04.940
Easy.

1:11:06.340 --> 1:11:07.980
Easy, easy.

1:11:22.340 --> 1:11:23.500
What happened?

1:11:25.220 --> 1:11:26.500
You hit your head.

1:11:32.180 --> 1:11:33.580
Where is Shane?

1:11:39.700 --> 1:11:42.900
Matt, where is he?

1:11:49.060 --> 1:11:50.260
He's dead.

1:11:52.580 --> 1:11:55.340
What? How?

1:11:57.540 --> 1:11:59.820
We were fighting
for the gun and he...

1:12:00.900 --> 1:12:02.260
He got shot.

1:12:09.180 --> 1:12:10.900
Where is the body?

1:12:14.340 --> 1:12:15.740
I took it outside.

1:13:05.260 --> 1:13:06.420
It's okay.

1:13:07.540 --> 1:13:08.620
It's okay.

1:14:22.580 --> 1:14:23.580
Kate?

1:14:27.300 --> 1:14:28.540
Kate?

1:14:32.940 --> 1:14:33.940
Kate?

1:14:40.820 --> 1:14:41.900
Kate?

1:14:44.740 --> 1:14:45.740
Kate?

1:14:46.020 --> 1:14:47.180
Kate!

1:15:26.700 --> 1:15:28.100
What are we gonna do?

1:15:28.740 --> 1:15:29.860
About what?

1:15:31.300 --> 1:15:32.540
About this place.

1:15:34.380 --> 1:15:36.300
I don't think I can
live here anymore.

1:15:38.660 --> 1:15:39.940
Why not?

1:15:43.580 --> 1:15:46.340
You have...
food on your lip.

1:15:55.500 --> 1:15:57.140
Where can we go?

1:15:57.940 --> 1:16:00.460
We have no money,
no jobs.

1:16:01.980 --> 1:16:04.020
At least here the
room will provide.

1:16:14.860 --> 1:16:17.820
It's been hard, but
we'll get over it.

1:16:46.340 --> 1:16:47.500
Eat your food.

1:19:01.220 --> 1:19:02.620
What do you wanna do?

1:19:38.660 --> 1:19:40.020
What are you doing ?

1:19:40.220 --> 1:19:42.580
- Is this what you like?
- What? Stop?

1:19:42.700 --> 1:19:44.620
Don't worry, I
saw you two do it.

1:19:52.820 --> 1:19:54.100
Hey, Mom.

1:20:01.740 --> 1:20:04.300
Help! Help!

1:21:04.620 --> 1:21:05.620
No!

1:23:14.140 --> 1:23:15.100
Kate.

1:23:15.540 --> 1:23:17.820
Honey, come on,
we have to go.

1:23:18.700 --> 1:23:20.860
- Matt?
- Yes it's me. Come on.

1:23:22.020 --> 1:23:23.980
He was just like you.

1:23:23.980 --> 1:23:25.020
Kate.

1:23:27.020 --> 1:23:29.580
No, no, no. Kate, don't
listen to him, it's the room.

1:23:29.780 --> 1:23:30.380
Come with me.

1:23:30.500 --> 1:23:32.340
No, no, no, no.
Don't listen to him.

1:23:32.900 --> 1:23:33.580
Kate, it's me.

1:23:34.540 --> 1:23:36.740
- No, Kate, come with me, come on.
- Please.

1:23:39.060 --> 1:23:40.420
June bug.

1:23:42.060 --> 1:23:42.940
It's me.

1:23:43.020 --> 1:23:44.100
Yes, june bug.

1:23:45.140 --> 1:23:46.820
Come on, let's go.

1:23:50.180 --> 1:23:50.980
Shane.

1:24:13.740 --> 1:24:14.620
Shit.

1:24:30.060 --> 1:24:31.220
We're still in the room.

1:24:50.580 --> 1:24:52.100
It's playing with us.

1:24:58.380 --> 1:24:59.420
I've got an idea.

1:25:22.540 --> 1:25:23.460
Mommy?

1:25:26.460 --> 1:25:27.460
Daddy.

1:25:30.180 --> 1:25:31.020
Daddy!

1:25:51.820 --> 1:25:52.740
Mommy?

1:25:55.260 --> 1:25:56.460
It's okay, mommy.

1:26:01.380 --> 1:26:02.380
Mommy!

1:26:02.780 --> 1:26:04.420
No!

1:26:56.780 --> 1:26:58.060
Come on!

1:27:07.500 --> 1:27:08.620
Mommy!

1:27:10.300 --> 1:27:11.140
Mommy!

1:27:24.220 --> 1:27:24.980
Stop!

1:27:24.980 --> 1:27:26.020
Mother!

1:27:29.580 --> 1:27:30.660
Mommy!

1:27:34.500 --> 1:27:35.420
Please.

1:27:47.860 --> 1:27:48.780
Mommy.

1:30:03.940 --> 1:30:05.500
Honey, open up,
I got you coffee.

1:30:13.700 --> 1:30:14.660
Kate.

1:30:29.260 --> 1:30:30.060
Kate.

1:30:49.540 --> 1:30:50.500
Kate!

1:31:04.580 --> 1:31:08.340
