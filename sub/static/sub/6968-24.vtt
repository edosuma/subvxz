00:27.694 --> 00:33.325
We don't have to be out here, you know.
It's not like you're still in high school.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.536
We can go to the motel.

00:35.619 --> 00:39.665
- I wouldn't want anyone to see us.
- No one will see us.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.834
It's a small town.

01:02.396 --> 01:05.691
George... Come on, George.

01:31.592 --> 01:35.971
- Why'd you change your mind anyway?
- You're pretty persistent, I guess.

01:36.013 --> 01:38.599
- Squeaky wheel gets the oil?
- I guess so.

01:38.724 --> 01:42.311
What's wrong with right here?
I could set the blanket down and...

01:42.352 --> 01:44.646
- Not yet.
- Why not?

01:45.439 --> 01:48.609
Because... you have to catch me first.

01:52.863 --> 01:56.783
Oh, come on now! You don't
want me to chase after you, do ya?

02:00.454 --> 02:02.581
Paula!

02:08.961 --> 02:10.881
Paula?

02:16.762 --> 02:18.597
Paula...

02:18.639 --> 02:20.766
Where are you?

02:28.232 --> 02:30.234
Son of a bitch!

02:52.183 --> 02:55.061
<font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font> Season 2
Episode 24 - Our Town

03:44.183 --> 03:48.061
I don't know, Scully. The man hasn't
been seen or heard from in ten weeks.

03:48.145 --> 03:51.023
Come on, Mulder. They're wasting our time.

03:51.106 --> 03:54.735
They're sending us
on some kind of a wild-goose chase.

03:54.818 --> 03:57.154
Chicken chase.

03:57.446 --> 04:01.408
George Kearns was a poultry inspector
assigned to Dudley, Arkansas...

04:01.491 --> 04:03.744
...home of Chaco Chicken.

04:03.827 --> 04:08.332
I'm not questioning the legitimacy of
the case, just their motives in assigning it.

04:08.415 --> 04:11.168
Doesn't it bother you
that they're undermining you?

04:11.251 --> 04:14.505
They may think they are,
but on the night he disappeared...

04:14.588 --> 04:18.257
...a woman on the I-10
saw a strange fire in an adjacent field.

04:18.341 --> 04:22.846
I read that report. She claims
that she saw some kind of a foxfire spirit.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.891
I'm surprised she didn't
call Oprah after the police.

04:25.974 --> 04:31.897
19th-century tales from the Ozarks describe
people being taken away by fireballs.

04:31.980 --> 04:35.692
- The spirits of massacred Indians.
- Those are only legends.

04:35.776 --> 04:39.196
Well, most legends
don't leave behind 12-foot burn marks.

04:39.279 --> 04:43.283
That was taken by state police
in the field where the woman saw foxfire.

04:43.742 --> 04:49.498
- This could have been made by a bonfire.
- I thought so, too. Until I remembered this.

04:49.581 --> 04:53.210
A documentary I saw when I was
in college about an insane asylum.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.755
- It gave me nightmares.
- I thought nothing gave you nightmares.

04:56.839 --> 04:58.924
I was young.

05:00.384 --> 05:03.303
They, uh... See, they took...

05:03.387 --> 05:06.932
They, uh... They took me away.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.434
They took me away... This... The fire demons.

05:09.518 --> 05:14.439
The fire demons...
wanted their pound of flesh.

05:14.523 --> 05:16.525
But, uh...

05:16.608 --> 05:19.653
...I'm too fast for 'em.

05:21.613 --> 05:25.075
You cannot kill them.
You can't let them kill you. Oh, no...

05:25.158 --> 05:29.162
No, don't let them kill you.
That's no way to get to heaven.

05:29.246 --> 05:31.331
No, sir...

05:32.541 --> 05:35.085
No, sir. That is no way to get to heaven.

05:35.169 --> 05:40.757
His name was Creighton Jones. He pulled off
the road on May 17th 1961 to take a nap.

05:40.841 --> 05:45.721
They found him three days later so deranged
by what he'd seen that he was committed.

05:45.804 --> 05:50.642
The state police found his car on the I-10,
right in the middle of Dudley, Arkansas...

05:50.726 --> 05:52.811
...home of Chaco Chicken.

06:09.161 --> 06:11.455
What's this, Mulder?

06:13.165 --> 06:18.545
That's a witches' peg. Staking it into the
ground is supposed to ward off evil spirits.

06:18.629 --> 06:20.714
Can I help you folks?

06:21.465 --> 06:25.135
I'm Sheriff Arens.
I saw you back at the turn-off.

06:25.219 --> 06:28.347
FBI. I'm Special Agent Mulder.
This is Agent Scully.

06:28.430 --> 06:31.517
We're investigating
George Kearns's disappearance.

06:31.600 --> 06:36.271
I'm happy to help you, but I'm not sure
how much there is to investigate.

06:36.355 --> 06:40.901
- Sheriff, a man is missing.
- We found no evidence of criminal activity.

06:40.984 --> 06:45.030
Since no body turned up,
we just filed a missing person's report.

06:45.113 --> 06:48.367
Why didn't you mention
this witches' peg in your report?

06:48.450 --> 06:51.245
Because these hills
are filled with witches' pegs.

06:51.328 --> 06:54.706
These old hill people
cling tight to their superstitions.

06:54.790 --> 06:58.460
- What about the scorched area?
- Illegal trash burn.

06:58.544 --> 07:01.839
I keep handing out the citations.
They keep doing it anyway.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.258
Cheaper to pay a fine
than haul it to the dump.

07:04.341 --> 07:07.177
- So you don't believe it's foxfire?
- Sir...

07:07.261 --> 07:11.265
...foxfire's nothing more than
a ghost story about swamp gas.

07:11.348 --> 07:16.603
Listen, Kearns was passin' through town
ever since he got here six months ago.

07:16.687 --> 07:18.981
- How do you mean?
- Never did fit in.

07:19.314 --> 07:21.817
Not at the plant, not even in his own home.

07:21.900 --> 07:26.989
- He cheated on his wife every chance he got.
- Did he have many chances?

07:27.072 --> 07:32.995
George is the type of man you'd expect to go
chasin' some sweet young thing out of town.

07:33.078 --> 07:37.916
- Is that what his wife thinks happened?
- Push comes to shove, I'm sure she does.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.419
But you're welcome to ask her yourself.

07:45.215 --> 07:49.178
My husband had a character
that leaves something out.

07:49.261 --> 07:51.263
I always knew that about him...

07:51.346 --> 07:56.727
...but I didn't have the sense to do anything
about it. I guess he saved me the trouble.

07:56.810 --> 08:00.939
So you're fairly certain
that he left you for somebody else?

08:01.023 --> 08:05.903
George left me a long time ago,
right around the time I turned 40.

08:06.403 --> 08:08.822
Leavin' town was just a formality.

08:08.906 --> 08:14.161
- Do you know who he might be with now?
- No. And I don't wanna know, either.

08:14.244 --> 08:18.707
He was about to file this inspection report
with the Department of Agriculture...

08:18.790 --> 08:22.085
...the day before he disappeared.
- I know nothing about that.

08:22.419 --> 08:27.508
- He never discussed his work with you?
- He never told me and I never asked.

08:27.591 --> 08:32.471
He cited several health violations. He was
gonna recommend the plant be shut down.

08:32.554 --> 08:35.390
I don't know a thing about
what went on in that plant.

08:35.474 --> 08:39.895
Did he ever receive threatening phone calls
or anything unusual in the mail?

08:39.977 --> 08:44.316
There were hang-ups, but I always
thought it was one of his girlfriends.

08:46.318 --> 08:48.529
I'm gonna give you my phone number.

08:48.612 --> 08:52.658
If your husband tries to contact you,
I want you to get in touch with me.

08:52.741 --> 08:55.577
Or if you can think of anything else.

09:36.702 --> 09:38.912
Come on, Paula. Let's go!

10:22.164 --> 10:26.793
This is Jess Harold, the floor manager.
Jess, these people are with the FBI.

10:26.877 --> 10:29.171
You're here about George Kearns?

10:29.254 --> 10:33.342
His disappearance may have
something to do with a report...

10:33.425 --> 10:36.762
...he was about to file
with the Department of Agriculture.

10:36.845 --> 10:40.265
Ever since he got here,
George was trying to shut us down.

10:40.933 --> 10:45.938
- He cited multiple violations.
- I know. I had to answer to each one of them.

10:46.480 --> 10:49.233
Was there any merit to his claims?

10:49.316 --> 10:51.777
Let me show you something.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.795
Paula, are you OK?

11:37.447 --> 11:42.744
This is where George worked. Every chicken
passes through the inspectors' station.

11:42.828 --> 11:47.374
We've been here 50 years and had no trouble
with the USDA until George came along.

11:47.457 --> 11:50.794
- So he really did threaten to shut it down.
- Oh, he tried.

11:50.878 --> 11:55.757
But we got three other inspectors here
consistently give us top marks. Here.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.594
See for yourself.

11:58.677 --> 12:01.096
The only problem this plant had was George.

12:01.180 --> 12:04.266
Problem enough to do something about?

12:04.349 --> 12:08.020
If you mean any kind of unsavouriness,
I guess anything's possible.

12:08.103 --> 12:11.899
George had a bone to pick with everyone,
even the federal government.

12:11.982 --> 12:14.943
- What do you mean?
- He filed a compensation suit.

12:15.027 --> 12:19.698
Claimed he was getting terrible headaches.
"Line hypnosis" his lawyers called it.

12:19.948 --> 12:23.327
Yeah, it's caused by
high-speed repetitive activity.

12:23.410 --> 12:28.707
I don't deny a lot of chickens go through here
but we operate within federal guidelines.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.876
What happened to his lawsuit?

12:30.959 --> 12:35.339
It was dismissed, just a few weeks
before he disappeared.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.508
What's that?

12:38.383 --> 12:40.260
Oh, that.

12:40.344 --> 12:42.888
Feed grinder. Chops up bone, tissue.

12:42.971 --> 12:47.351
See, any part of the bird we can't package,
we process and use as feed.

12:47.601 --> 12:51.063
- Chickens feed on chickens?
- It doesn't sound appetising.

12:51.146 --> 12:53.482
But it is nutritious and cuts down on cost.

12:53.565 --> 12:58.487
The meat is cooked, then mixed with grain.
No reason to let all that protein go to waste.

12:58.570 --> 13:01.657
- Excuse me. I got a shift change.
- Howdy, Sheriff.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.617
Logan.

13:04.159 --> 13:07.162
Mulder, ready to admit
they sent us on a fool's errand?

13:07.246 --> 13:10.582
If the fool would persist in his folly,
he'd become wise.

13:10.666 --> 13:16.296
Whether Kearns left or was killed, this could
have been handled by any Kansas City agent.

13:16.380 --> 13:18.966
I'm not so sure about that.

13:21.051 --> 13:23.262
Let him go! We're federal agents.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.890
Everyone stay calm!

13:27.891 --> 13:30.060
Don't hurt him! Tell us what you want.

13:30.352 --> 13:33.272
Don't get excited. Just calm down.

13:34.022 --> 13:37.234
Stay calm! You don't want anyone to get hurt.

13:37.901 --> 13:41.280
We can talk this thing out.
Why don't you give me the knife?

13:50.998 --> 13:53.125
You OK?

14:10.601 --> 14:13.103
Do you have any idea why she attacked you?

14:13.187 --> 14:16.690
- None at all.
- No recent complaints or strange behaviour?

14:17.024 --> 14:21.236
Paula has always been one of
our best employees. Stable, well-liked.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.989
I can't begin to imagine what brought this on.

14:24.072 --> 14:26.825
Dr Randolph, do you have any ideas?

14:26.909 --> 14:29.328
If you're done with me, I got work to do.

14:29.703 --> 14:33.373
Come by tomorrow and let me
make sure it's not infected.

14:33.457 --> 14:35.334
Sure.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.254
Uh...

14:39.338 --> 14:42.883
Paula came by last week,
complaining of persistent headaches.

14:42.966 --> 14:46.678
She had suddenly started
getting irritable, unable to sleep.

14:47.054 --> 14:50.641
- Did you determine the cause?
- I'm just the staff physician.

14:50.724 --> 14:53.101
I usually only treat hand injuries...

14:53.185 --> 14:56.813
...so I'm a little out of my depth
on psychiatric matters.

14:56.897 --> 14:59.566
Was anything physically wrong with her?

14:59.650 --> 15:02.528
I sent her to County
for a brain scan and an EEG.

15:02.611 --> 15:06.615
Both came back normal, so I assumed
her condition was stress-related.

15:06.698 --> 15:11.161
- Could it have been line hypnosis?
- I'm not qualified to make that diagnosis.

15:11.245 --> 15:15.040
But you can tell us whether
George Kearns had similar complaints.

15:15.582 --> 15:19.294
They presented similar symptoms, yeah.

15:19.753 --> 15:25.384
- How did you treat them?
- Both with pain medication-codeine.

15:25.467 --> 15:28.887
I think an autopsy on Paula Gray
would clarify things.

15:28.971 --> 15:32.182
I'm, uh... afraid I can't authorise that.

15:32.266 --> 15:35.435
- That's up to Mr Chaco.
- Why? You're her physician.

15:35.519 --> 15:41.400
Yeah, but Mr Chaco was Paula Gray's
grandfather... and her legal guardian.

16:35.996 --> 16:38.498
Mr Chaco?

16:38.582 --> 16:40.834
Feedin' these chickens...

16:41.418 --> 16:44.129
...helps me clear my mind.

16:45.589 --> 16:48.217
They're perfect creatures, you know.

16:48.300 --> 16:53.305
We eat their meat, their eggs,
sleep on pillows stuffed with their feathers.

16:55.265 --> 16:58.977
Not many people I know
are as useful as these chickens.

16:59.061 --> 17:02.689
Sorry to disturb you, sir.
We realise this is difficult for you.

17:02.773 --> 17:06.568
You wanna conduct
an autopsy on my granddaughter.

17:07.653 --> 17:09.320
Why?

17:12.449 --> 17:16.078
You think Paula had some disease
that made her act that way?

17:16.912 --> 17:20.082
That's what we're hoping
a postmortem will determine.

17:20.165 --> 17:23.167
I thought your business
was Kearns's disappearance.

17:23.252 --> 17:26.964
It is, but it may be linked with
what happened to your granddaughter.

17:27.464 --> 17:28.799
How?

17:28.882 --> 17:34.346
It's possible they may have both suffered
from the same neurological disorder.

17:34.429 --> 17:40.185
You know, when I came here after the war,
Dudley was just a patch of dirt.

17:40.727 --> 17:44.773
I built that plant
and put my whole family to work there.

17:45.524 --> 17:49.528
We made this town one of the biggest
chicken processors in the nation.

17:50.279 --> 17:53.991
We couldn't have done that
with troublemakers and layabouts.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.159
I assume you mean George Kearns.

17:56.243 --> 18:01.957
Men like George Kearns don't build things.
They tend to tear 'em down.

18:02.207 --> 18:06.044
Then you're aware of his recommendation
to close down your plant?

18:06.128 --> 18:08.213
You know...

18:08.672 --> 18:12.926
...livin' a long life is a mixed blessing.

18:13.010 --> 18:17.639
You spend your youth trying to build
something for yourself and your family...

18:17.723 --> 18:23.270
...and your community, only to watch it
all taken away from you at your old age.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.940
Still...

18:27.024 --> 18:30.068
...I'm not ready to die just yet.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.989
You go do your autopsy on Paula.

18:34.489 --> 18:37.701
I wanna know
what happened to my granddaughter.

18:54.301 --> 18:56.720
I think we've got something here, Mulder.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.014
- Take a look.
- What am I looking at?

18:59.097 --> 19:01.350
A specimen from Paula's brain.

19:01.433 --> 19:05.354
She had a rare degenerative disorder
called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

19:05.437 --> 19:08.982
It's characterised by the formation
of holes in the brain tissue.

19:09.066 --> 19:14.780
- Why didn't they show up on her charts?
- Short of an autopsy, it's hard to diagnose.

19:14.863 --> 19:18.492
I've only seen infected tissue once,
back in medical school.

19:18.575 --> 19:21.578
- Could it be why she attacked Jess Harold?
- Absolutely.

19:21.662 --> 19:26.250
Victims of Creutzfeldt-Jakob suffer from
progressive dementia, severe seizures.

19:26.333 --> 19:29.711
- Is it fatal?
- This girl would have been dead in months.

19:30.212 --> 19:34.842
Except that Paula Gray was no girl.
This is her personnel file. Check it out.

19:35.425 --> 19:38.470
It says here that
Paula Gray was born in 1948...

19:38.554 --> 19:43.016
...which means that this woman,
Chaco's granddaughter, was 47 years old.

19:44.142 --> 19:45.686
There must be a mistake.

19:45.769 --> 19:49.857
Let's find out. Her birth certificate
should be on file at the courthouse.

19:49.940 --> 19:55.153
Who knows, Scully? This could turn out
to be even more interesting than foxfire.

20:07.666 --> 20:12.588
The odds that they both had the same
disease are practically nonexistent.

20:12.671 --> 20:16.675
Creutzfeldt-Jakob can be hereditary,
but it's not communicable.

20:16.758 --> 20:20.888
That two unrelated people in one town
contracted the same rare disease is...

20:20.971 --> 20:26.059
A lot more likely than Paula Gray
being three years shy of her 50th birthday.

20:26.977 --> 20:28.729
Mulder, look out!

20:45.329 --> 20:47.664
Call an ambulance!

20:47.748 --> 20:50.042
I'll try to get the driver out.

20:54.671 --> 20:58.967
This is Federal Agent Scully.
I'd like to report an accident...

21:11.522 --> 21:17.444
I just got off the phone with Dr Randolph.
He said this driver had the same symptoms.

21:17.528 --> 21:23.033
You're saying this is a third victim? You told
me two cases are statistically impossible.

21:23.116 --> 21:25.118
They would be.

21:25.202 --> 21:28.247
I just came up with a sick theory, Mulder.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.415
Ooh, I'm listening.

21:31.166 --> 21:36.046
You saw the feed grinders at the plant. What
if somebody put Kearns's body in there?

21:36.129 --> 21:41.635
This is a prion disease, so it may have passed
on to the chickens and whoever ate them.

21:41.718 --> 21:44.304
So anyone eating the chickens
would be at risk?

21:44.388 --> 21:49.893
It's possible. In England they incinerate cattle
to stop them passing on mad cow disease.

21:49.977 --> 21:52.563
These chickens
are shipped all over the country.

21:52.646 --> 21:57.484
If you're right, we'd be seeing an epidemic,
not just a few local cases.

21:58.235 --> 22:00.112
Sheriff?

22:02.239 --> 22:04.783
What's wrong with this water?

22:06.535 --> 22:10.873
Runoff from the plant.
Chicken litter, mostly. Some blood and parts.

22:10.956 --> 22:13.834
Was this river searched
after Kearns disappeared?

22:14.042 --> 22:16.545
Are you kiddin'? A needle in a haystack!

22:16.628 --> 22:19.715
I'd like it dragged as soon as possible.

22:20.757 --> 22:23.385
Why would you wanna do that?

22:23.468 --> 22:25.888
To see what's in there.

22:25.971 --> 22:30.517
That's a filthy job, and I would first
like to know what you're lookin' for.

22:30.601 --> 22:32.895
Hopefully, nothing.

22:34.438 --> 22:38.650
Look, Sheriff, if you don't wanna do it,
I can get some of my men to do it.

22:38.734 --> 22:40.819
I'll do it.

22:42.571 --> 22:44.573
- Mulder...
- It's just a hunch.

22:44.656 --> 22:48.202
If Kearns didn't run off,
if he was murdered for that report...

22:48.285 --> 22:51.079
...then his body's gotta be somewhere.

23:09.431 --> 23:12.851
We closed the spillway
and the water level dropped.

23:12.935 --> 23:16.939
- They came up with it almost immediately.
- Did you find Kearns?

23:17.022 --> 23:19.441
Maybe you'd better see for yourself.

23:53.934 --> 23:58.772
Sheriff Arens is outside.
They're still pulling bones from the river.

23:58.856 --> 24:02.776
Well, so far I've been able
to isolate nine distinct skeletons.

24:02.860 --> 24:05.571
This one belonged to the late George Kearns.

24:05.904 --> 24:10.075
- How do you know?
- The pin... in his femur.

24:11.577 --> 24:16.957
According to his medical file,
Kearns broke his right leg four years ago.

24:17.040 --> 24:21.503
- What about the others?
- I'll need more sophisticated equipment...

24:21.587 --> 24:26.008
...but I estimate that some of these bones
are as much as 20 or 30 years old.

24:26.633 --> 24:30.179
All of them share one strange detail, though.

24:31.180 --> 24:34.433
- They seem to have lost their heads.
- Besides that.

24:35.934 --> 24:39.813
The older bones show signs of decay
and abrasion, like you'd expect.

24:39.897 --> 24:46.153
But for some reason all of them, even
Kearns's, are smooth and buffed at the ends.

24:50.199 --> 24:52.826
It's almost like they've been polished.

24:52.910 --> 24:55.078
It could be erosion from the water...

24:55.162 --> 24:58.332
Well, that water had hardly any current.

24:58.415 --> 25:02.794
This level of erosion wouldn't be confined
to just the ends of the bones.

25:03.795 --> 25:06.089
- Any theories?
- Maybe.

25:09.218 --> 25:11.053
Sheriff...

25:12.179 --> 25:15.015
- Doris.
- Is it true? Just tell me.

25:15.098 --> 25:18.936
- Doris, I want you to listen to me.
- They found him, didn't they?

25:19.228 --> 25:22.981
We brought up quite a few remains
at the river this afternoon.

25:23.065 --> 25:25.567
George's were among them.

25:26.443 --> 25:27.903
I'm sorry.

25:28.362 --> 25:31.615
Listen, I'm really sorry. It's gonna be all right.

25:31.698 --> 25:34.493
Don't worry, Doris. We'll take care of you.

25:34.576 --> 25:36.578
Doris?

25:36.954 --> 25:39.331
- Dee, that the new schedule?
- Yeah.

25:43.252 --> 25:45.337
Looks good.

26:07.234 --> 26:10.571
Why do I get the feeling
you're not here to check up on my neck?

26:10.654 --> 26:14.199
- They found bones in the river.
- I know. I heard.

26:14.491 --> 26:18.954
Did you also hear that Clayton Walsh
came down with the symptoms? That's four.

26:19.037 --> 26:22.165
It's getting worse
with every day that goes by.

26:23.542 --> 26:28.172
- Someone has to tell Mr Chaco.
- He knows, but he's not doing anything.

26:30.591 --> 26:33.719
- Maybe I should talk to him.
- You can try.

26:34.803 --> 26:37.681
I will talk to him. He'll listen to me.

26:39.349 --> 26:41.435
And if he doesn't?

26:53.864 --> 27:00.037
I had Danny run a check on missing persons
last seen within a 200-mile radius of Dudley.

27:00.120 --> 27:04.583
In the last 50 years
87 people have disappeared near here.

27:04.666 --> 27:11.006
Judging from the forensic evidence, I'd say
the same person or persons was responsible.

27:11.089 --> 27:13.759
It may have been the work of a cult.

27:13.842 --> 27:19.681
Scully, I think that the good people of Dudley
have been eating more than just chicken.

27:22.059 --> 27:25.521
- You think these people were eaten?
- Look at these bones.

27:25.604 --> 27:29.650
They've been polished at both ends,
suggesting they were boiled in a pot.

27:29.733 --> 27:32.236
Anthropologists used similar evidence...

27:32.319 --> 27:36.365
...to prove cannibalism among
the Anasazi tribe of New Mexico.

27:37.908 --> 27:42.621
Then Paula Gray may have contracted
Creutzfeldt-Jakob by eating George Kearns.

27:43.163 --> 27:47.626
- That could explain her youthful appearance.
- What are you talking about?

27:47.709 --> 27:51.213
Some cannibalistic rituals
are believed to prolong life.

27:51.296 --> 27:54.925
Cannibalism is one thing,
but increasing longevity by it...

27:55.175 --> 28:00.347
Think about it, Scully. From vampirism
to Catholicism, literally or symbolically...

28:00.430 --> 28:05.102
...the reward for eating flesh is eternal life.
I don't know how it works, but we saw Paula.

28:05.185 --> 28:07.312
We never confirmed her date of birth.

28:07.396 --> 28:13.068
Maybe the courthouse records can tell us if
she, or anybody else, is lying about their age.

28:17.698 --> 28:19.783
You coming?

28:27.791 --> 28:30.460
You gotta do something, Mr Chaco.

28:31.211 --> 28:35.090
People are gettin' scared.
They don't know what to make of things.

28:35.174 --> 28:37.676
They're losing faith is what it sounds like.

28:37.759 --> 28:41.054
It's gettin' hard to hold on to,
the way things are goin'.

28:41.138 --> 28:44.933
- Three more got sick since yesterday.
- I lost my granddaughter in this!

28:45.017 --> 28:48.145
So don't tell me what we're up against!

28:48.896 --> 28:50.981
Now, I said I'd handle it.

28:51.064 --> 28:53.150
I know you...

28:56.570 --> 28:58.822
- Yes?
- I need to see Mr Chaco.

28:59.406 --> 29:01.158
Doris.

29:06.246 --> 29:09.917
I can't do this any more, Mr Chaco.
I can't keep lyin'.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.921
It's all right. Jess told me what happened.

29:14.087 --> 29:17.674
- You have nothing to worry about.
- But they're gonna think I did it.

29:17.758 --> 29:21.261
- No, they won't think any such thing.
- But I did!

29:21.345 --> 29:23.222
- No.
- I helped!

29:23.305 --> 29:28.477
He was no good, Doris.
He had no values. He didn't fit in here.

29:28.560 --> 29:33.815
- But he was my husband.
- That was the price that you had to pay.

29:33.899 --> 29:37.361
- You knew that from the beginning.
- But those FBI agents...

29:37.444 --> 29:40.989
Uh-uh. This town wasn't built in a day.

29:41.573 --> 29:43.909
It's not about to fall apart in a day.

29:44.326 --> 29:48.413
No, you're a part of us now.
And we're gonna take good care of you.

29:49.456 --> 29:52.793
Now, I want you to go home, get some rest.

29:52.876 --> 29:55.712
You've got a funeral to go to.

29:55.796 --> 30:01.218
This whole thing'll blow over soon enough
and you'll wonder what all the fuss is about.

30:02.052 --> 30:05.097
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

30:05.180 --> 30:08.559
We all understand, Doris. Good night.

30:20.612 --> 30:23.031
Yeah, she'll be fine.

30:23.115 --> 30:28.161
- She's not stable.
- She's one of us now. Part of our town.

30:28.954 --> 30:32.624
Unless we do something about her,
there won't be any town left.

30:32.708 --> 30:34.793
No!

30:34.877 --> 30:39.673
Once we start turning on ourselves,
we're no better than the animals.

30:41.216 --> 30:44.136
It's the FBI we should be worryin' about.

30:45.179 --> 30:47.472
They're the real problem.

31:13.123 --> 31:16.251
Someone's been
playing with matches.

31:19.171 --> 31:21.256
Smells like a recent fire.

31:23.425 --> 31:27.638
I bet it's no coincidence
it only hit the birth records.

31:27.721 --> 31:30.307
You think
someone was expecting us?

31:39.816 --> 31:43.445
- Mulder.
- It's Doris Kearns.

31:43.529 --> 31:47.491
I'm in my house.
I need to speak with you right away.

31:47.616 --> 31:50.953
- Are you all right?
- I'm afraid for my life.

31:52.579 --> 31:54.665
I'm afraid he'll kill me.

31:54.748 --> 31:56.625
Who?

31:58.919 --> 32:02.339
- Mr Chaco.
- All right, Mrs Kearns.

32:02.422 --> 32:06.218
Stay in the house. Don't answer
the door until Agent Scully arrives.

32:08.053 --> 32:11.306
- Where are you going?
- To take Chaco into custody.

32:16.895 --> 32:18.772
Oh!

32:31.159 --> 32:33.537
No...

33:07.988 --> 33:09.656
Mrs Kearns?

33:29.676 --> 33:31.762
Mrs Kearns?

33:56.495 --> 33:58.580
Mrs Kearns?

34:31.697 --> 34:34.949
- Is Mr Chaco in?
- I'll see if he's still awake.

35:32.216 --> 35:36.470
I'm sorry, but Mr Chaco
is unable to see you now.

35:36.553 --> 35:38.764
- D'you know what's in here?
- No.

35:38.847 --> 35:41.350
- Can you open it?
- I don't have the key.

35:53.153 --> 35:55.239
What do you think you're doin'?!

36:21.265 --> 36:24.476
- Scully.
- Scully, Chaco's not here.

36:24.560 --> 36:28.939
Yeah. Mrs Kearns is missing, too, Mulder.
I think someone's been here.

36:29.022 --> 36:33.569
The power's been cut and the back door
was wide open. Her car is still out back.

36:34.486 --> 36:36.780
Chaco must've taken her.

36:36.864 --> 36:39.283
Scully? Scully!

36:39.575 --> 36:43.370
Scully! What happened?
Scully, are you there?

36:43.453 --> 36:45.122
You all right?

36:45.205 --> 36:47.082
Scully!

36:47.875 --> 36:49.960
Answer me! Scully!

37:32.836 --> 37:35.339
What have you done here?

37:36.381 --> 37:38.300
I warned ya!

37:38.383 --> 37:40.886
I said not to touch her!

37:40.969 --> 37:43.805
Doris Kearns was one of us!

37:43.889 --> 37:45.974
Who's behind this?

37:54.149 --> 37:58.987
Why didn't you listen? It's the outsiders
we have to deal with, not one of our own.

37:59.071 --> 38:01.490
We'll deal with them all.

38:01.573 --> 38:06.119
Look at yourselves!
Look at what you've become!

38:06.203 --> 38:09.706
This isn't faith any more. It's just fear.

38:09.831 --> 38:11.959
You've become an abomination!

38:12.125 --> 38:14.878
You brought in the outsider
who made us sick.

38:15.254 --> 38:18.590
Once you turn on yourselves, it's over.

38:20.050 --> 38:23.387
How long before it's any one of us?

38:26.640 --> 38:28.600
Any one of you?!

38:29.434 --> 38:32.229
That's not your problem any more, Mr Chaco.

38:35.357 --> 38:37.192
No!

38:38.402 --> 38:40.320
No!

38:48.120 --> 38:50.205
Kill me...

38:51.999 --> 38:54.459
...and you kill us all.

39:19.193 --> 39:21.153
Watch it.

39:21.236 --> 39:23.322
Got it.

39:45.761 --> 39:47.846
Bring her over.

41:11.180 --> 41:13.056
Aagh!

41:31.200 --> 41:33.285
- Are you hurt?
- Uh-uh.

41:35.787 --> 41:37.873
Are you all right?

42:35.472 --> 42:39.560
People,
stand away from your work stations!

42:39.643 --> 42:44.940
Pending further review, the Chaco
processing plant was closed by the USDA.

42:45.023 --> 42:49.111
So far, no evidence of contaminated chicken
has been discovered.

42:49.486 --> 42:54.157
Though it remains unknown how many
citizens participated in the ritual activity...

42:54.241 --> 42:58.412
...27 have become fatally ill
with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

42:59.079 --> 43:02.875
What is known is that
a transport plane carrying Walter Chaco...

43:02.958 --> 43:06.086
...was shot down in 1944 over New Guinea.

43:06.545 --> 43:09.256
Chaco was the only survivor of that crash.

43:09.965 --> 43:13.427
According to naval records,
he spent six months with the Jale...

43:13.510 --> 43:18.765
...a tribe whose cannibalistic practices
have long been suspected, but never proven.

43:18.849 --> 43:23.103
Naval records also show that
Walter Chaco was born in 1902...

43:23.645 --> 43:26.940
...making him 93 years old
at the time of his death.

43:30.027 --> 43:34.406
As of this date,
his remains have yet to be found.
