<i>Brothers, hold the line?</i>

00:39.958 --> 00:44.083
<i>Till we got something?</i>

00:47.958 --> 00:51.833
<i>This world is way too small?</i>

00:52.000 --> 00:55.292
<i>To feel like nothing?</i>

00:59.333 --> 01:02.292
<i>I was found near
The train tracks?</i>

01:02.417 --> 01:06.750
<i>Looking so homeless at you?</i>

01:11.750 --> 01:14.000
<i>You came like a copper?</i>

01:14.208 --> 01:17.208
<i>You said
"Son, it's time to move?</i>

01:23.667 --> 01:27.000
<i>My love is comin'</i>
I <i>can barely hardly wait?</i>

01:29.041 --> 01:31.083
<i>Around?</i>

01:35.416 --> 01:37.250
See you, Cal.

01:37.416 --> 01:39.333
<i>Well, if you hide
Your questions?</i>

01:41.958 --> 01:44.916
<i>no answer?</i>

01:46.250 --> 01:47.708
<i>I finally found the cure?</i>

01:49.958 --> 01:53.416
<i>For my own cancer?</i>

01:53.875 --> 01:56.375
<i>Yeah, yeah?</i>

01:58.458 --> 02:00.666
Sue, no, no, no!

02:00.833 --> 02:03.208
Kill yourself on your own time.

02:03.833 --> 02:05.166
<i>My heart is thumpin'?</i>

02:05.333 --> 02:08.041
<i>I can feel it mom
With every beet?</i>

02:09.875 --> 02:13.250
<i>My love is coming'</i>
I <i>can barely hardly wait?</i>

02:15.958 --> 02:19.041
<i>Around?</i>

02:39.916 --> 02:42.250
According
to the <i>Art</i> of War by Sun Tzu,

02:42.416 --> 02:45.416
every battle is won and lost
before it is fought.

02:45.583 --> 02:47.500
Well, then I guess
you've already lost.

02:50.916 --> 02:54.166
Oh, that's not very sportsmanlike.
Let's fucking go!

02:58.708 --> 03:00.166
I <i>ain't gain to hell with you?</i>

03:00.333 --> 03:04.916
<i>alright now, baby
Just one last thing on my mind?</i>

03:05.666 --> 03:08.958
<i>Some say?</i>
Come on, come on, come on?

03:09.125 --> 03:10.375
<i>Fuck, yeah?</i>

03:15.958 --> 03:19.583
Fuck, yeah
Come on, come on, come on?

03:20.333 --> 03:23.125
Ladies. Hi again.

03:23.291 --> 03:25.083
This is the third time
we've been out.

03:25.250 --> 03:26.791
I know.
We're shutting this down.

03:26.958 --> 03:29.666
You don't wanna shut the party down.
You wanna join us.

03:29.833 --> 03:33.125
Why don't you put the guns in
the car and you come on in?

03:33.291 --> 03:35.500
Hey, Bill.
Sorry I'm late, buddy.

03:35.666 --> 03:37.541
Fucking Map Quest.
I know it, bro.

03:37.708 --> 03:40.416
I'm right with you with that shit.
Look, guys.

03:40.583 --> 03:44.041
Is this about earlier? When you first
came, I thought you were strippers?

03:44.208 --> 03:47.500
Because that was an accident.
You're just very attractive.

03:47.666 --> 03:48.958
Those uniforms are banging.

03:49.125 --> 03:52.416
If we have to come out here
again, it's a $1000 fine.

03:52.583 --> 03:54.583
Close it down.
Okay.

03:54.750 --> 03:55.958
Message received.

03:56.125 --> 03:57.458
It's done.
You have my word.

03:57.625 --> 04:00.416
I'm gonna go inside,
get on the mike, shut it down.

04:00.583 --> 04:03.416
? Johnny, rosin up your
bow And play your fiddle hard?

04:03.583 --> 04:05.250
? Cause hell's broke loose
In Georgia?

04:05.416 --> 04:07.250
? And the devil deals
The cards?

04:07.416 --> 04:09.541
? And if you win
You'll get this shiny?

04:09.708 --> 04:11.000
? Fiddle made of gold?

04:11.166 --> 04:14.666
? But if you lose
The devil gels your soul?'

04:17.083 --> 04:19.583
I don't understand why you
won't just put it on.

04:19.708 --> 04:21.833
Because I don't
find the notion of mocking

04:22.041 --> 04:24.750
the American underclass
as amusing as your friends do,

04:24.916 --> 04:27.583
and because I don't share
your desperate need to fit in.

04:27.750 --> 04:30.666
By not putting the wig on,
you are setting yourself

04:30.833 --> 04:32.208
and me apart from my friends,

04:32.375 --> 04:35.166
which is a controlling
and hostile gesture.

04:35.333 --> 04:36.750
Fine.

04:40.666 --> 04:41.875
Happy now?
Yes.

04:42.041 --> 04:44.333
Now I'm Mr. Fun Times.
I'm very happy. Thank you.

04:44.500 --> 04:45.541
I'm going for a smoke.

04:45.708 --> 04:48.291
Good, because
it's a fucking costume party.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.624
Do we need to talk
quietly around her?

04:53.791 --> 04:56.208
Oh, no, no, no.
She sleeps through anything.

04:56.374 --> 04:57.791
Yes, you do.

04:57.999 --> 05:02.208
When the babysitter bailed, Glenn and I were
like, 'Fuck it.' We have missed every party.

05:02.374 --> 05:04.374
No way we're missing
the White Trash Bash.

05:04.541 --> 05:08.083
Give it up for Glenn.
Glenn's getting married soon.

05:08.249 --> 05:10.499
I really did it.

05:10.666 --> 05:12.041
Aww.

05:12.208 --> 05:14.291
What's the deal with your
bachelorette weekend?

05:14.458 --> 05:15.833
Yeah!
I think it's gonna be

05:15.999 --> 05:17.874
more of a bachelorette night.

05:18.041 --> 05:21.708
And it's gonna be at
my folks' place in Jersey.

05:22.416 --> 05:24.833
Oh.
Sorry.

05:24.999 --> 05:27.416
That's gonna be fine.
That's totally fine.

05:27.583 --> 05:28.833
Has anyone seen Glenn?

05:28.999 --> 05:31.583
Human torpedo!

05:43.749 --> 05:45.874
It's okay.
He's a doctor.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.166
Hey, buttheads,
you guys seen Duquez?

05:52.333 --> 05:54.208
Will you relax
with the doughnuts?

05:54.374 --> 05:58.458
Oh, sweetie, I want to. I'm trying to push
the savory and all they want is the sweet.

05:58.624 --> 05:59.874
I promise you no one cares.

06:00.041 --> 06:02.291
Hey. Where the fuck
are the doughnuts?

06:02.708 --> 06:03.791
Except him.

06:04.124 --> 06:06.208
Guess what.
D. Duquez is AWOL.

06:06.374 --> 06:09.791
That is unacceptable.
I goth have it out with that guy.

06:09.958 --> 06:11.624
Like the doughnut police.

06:11.791 --> 06:14.291
Hey, get off of that thing.
It's Saturday night.

06:14.458 --> 06:17.958
Well, it's Sunday in Korea, and those
motherfuckers don't stop working.

06:18.124 --> 06:20.374
They make the Japanese
look like Jamaicans.

06:20.541 --> 06:23.666
Is that the new blackberry?
Yes, it is. Got it at the office.

06:23.833 --> 06:26.958
As punishment for not dressing up,
I'm putting this down my pants.

06:27.124 --> 06:29.041
No, no, no.
Just don't do that.

06:29.208 --> 06:30.666
My dick's checking your e-mail.

06:30.833 --> 06:32.499
I'm sending a text.
Don't do that.

06:32.666 --> 06:35.458
You have my life in your pants.
You cocksucker.

06:36.999 --> 06:38.416
? North Carolina?

06:39.541 --> 06:42.749
? How kind will she be??'

06:43.541 --> 06:46.541
Hey, you two, get a room
or get a video camera.

06:46.708 --> 06:48.708
Whoo!

06:48.874 --> 06:50.499
Hello. Excuse me, miss.
Hi.

06:50.666 --> 06:53.249
My name is Eric. This is my house.
My party, sort of.

06:53.416 --> 06:56.624
You're looking at a bunch of options.
This is the one you want.

06:56.791 --> 06:59.249
This is the finest box of wine
in the county.

06:59.416 --> 07:00.583
Really?
Yes, delicious

07:00.749 --> 07:04.708
It has absolutely no body and an
amazing cough-syrupy aftertaste.

07:04.874 --> 07:06.124
Go ahead.
Cheers.

07:06.291 --> 07:09.124
Don't get it on your skin.
All right?

07:09.291 --> 07:10.958
- Oh. Yeah.
- Wow.

07:11.124 --> 07:13.166
Not bad, right?
Mmm. Really good wine.

07:13.333 --> 07:14.583
Mm-hm.

07:14.749 --> 07:16.666
Even better bean dip.
That's not bean dip!

07:16.833 --> 07:18.374
What?
I'm kidding.

07:18.541 --> 07:20.374
You knew that.
That's awesome.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.666
You're the first person
to eat out of that.

07:22.833 --> 07:25.624
Not many people are thrilled
about eating out of a shitter.

07:25.791 --> 07:28.999
Really? In prison, we used
our crapper as a punchbowl.

07:29.166 --> 07:30.541
Really? No kidding?

07:30.708 --> 07:33.208
I have never seen you
at one of these things.

07:33.374 --> 07:35.416
First time.
We'll have to change that.

07:35.583 --> 07:37.583
We do these kind of things
all the time.

07:37.749 --> 07:40.999
You know, Labor Day. We're gonna
have a big Winter Wonderland party.

07:41.166 --> 07:42.624
Wow.
Snow machine.

07:42.791 --> 07:44.874
Gonna be sledding.
Should be interesting.

07:45.041 --> 07:46.874
Give me your information.
Ehh!

07:47.041 --> 07:48.166
What?
Information?

07:48.333 --> 07:49.541
Are you kidding me?
No.

07:49.708 --> 07:50.749
Really?
Yes.

07:50.916 --> 07:52.041
Yes, like what?

07:52.208 --> 07:54.541
Like my social security number,
my college GPA?

07:54.708 --> 07:57.958
Why don't we shirt with your
phone number and your shoe size?

08:00.833 --> 08:03.583
I happen to have a pen.
Of course you have a pen.

08:03.749 --> 08:06.374
You gotta be ready.
Always be prepared.

08:06.541 --> 08:07.666
Ah, ah, ah.
What?

08:07.833 --> 08:09.833
On my baby.
Look at that.

08:09.999 --> 08:13.083
Oh, I'm so jealous of
this baby. I'm so jealous.

08:13.249 --> 08:16.749
Oh, you wanna get out, I wanna get in there.
Ha-ha-ha. I'm kidding.

08:16.916 --> 08:18.583
Kelly, local number?

08:18.749 --> 08:19.791
Local girl.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.041
You kidding me?
Get out.

08:21.207 --> 08:22.666
Size 9 shoe.
Mm-hm.

08:22.832 --> 08:25.332
You know what they say.
'Big shoe, big uterus.'

08:26.707 --> 08:28.666
I'll bring friends.
Real sorry.

08:28.832 --> 08:31.374
If you excuse me, I see an
old friend just showed up.

08:31.541 --> 08:32.624
I'll talk to you liner

08:32.791 --> 08:34.291
Okay.
Nice meeting you.

08:34.457 --> 08:35.916
Nice to meet you too.
Hey, fucko.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.582
Excuse me.

08:37.749 --> 08:39.666
I'm really mad, actually.

08:39.832 --> 08:41.791
What's wrong with this guy?
Bye, guys.

08:41.957 --> 08:43.291
Daddy's goth go home.

08:43.457 --> 08:45.707
One more for the road.
Shotgun!

08:45.874 --> 08:47.041
Oh!

08:47.207 --> 08:48.957
Michael.
I wasn't ready. Throw another.

08:49.124 --> 08:51.124
Asshole.
You're supposed to catch that.

08:51.291 --> 08:52.666
Come on, baby, we're going.

08:52.832 --> 08:53.916
Bye, guys.
- Bye, Katie.

08:54.082 --> 08:55.791
I'm sorry if I got beer
on your baby.

08:56.166 --> 08:57.666
You, you.
Where have you been?

08:57.832 --> 08:59.957
I'm sorry. There was
a mess in the studio.

09:00.124 --> 09:02.041
There was this
buzzing undertone

09:02.207 --> 09:04.624
that was bending me over
and fucking me in the ass.

09:04.791 --> 09:06.791
Yeah. I'm not seeing
any doughnuts.

09:06.957 --> 09:08.957
You specifically
said get the glazed.

09:09.124 --> 09:11.457
They didn't have glazed.
I tried. There was jelly.

09:11.624 --> 09:14.916
There was Boston cream.
Jelly, Boston cream.

09:15.082 --> 09:17.957
Eric, I have a whole package
of ginger candies in my bag.

09:18.791 --> 09:20.291
Hi, Willow.

09:20.416 --> 09:22.457
Mmm, thank you.
But we're gonna be okay.

09:22.582 --> 09:24.416
I found you a big brown naked!

09:24.582 --> 09:26.499
I can't get it off!
I can't shake it off!

09:26.666 --> 09:29.291
Hey, everybody
naked in the pool.

09:34.124 --> 09:36.082
Well, that's a half hour
ahead of schedule.

09:37.916 --> 09:40.582
Yeah! Anybody?

09:40.749 --> 09:42.166
Anybody?

09:42.332 --> 09:44.666
Oh, you all suck.
Chickens hit.

09:44.832 --> 09:47.124
Want me to go to Brent's?
Pick up Entenmann's?

09:47.291 --> 09:48.332
Don't worry about it.

09:48.499 --> 09:50.416
Now I'm gonna go jump
in that pool

09:50.541 --> 09:52.499
because McCrudden
is dying in there alone.

09:52.666 --> 09:55.749
That's what friends do.
See, they don't leave each other hanging.

09:55.916 --> 09:58.249
Where's your patriotism?

09:58.416 --> 09:59.457
My man.

09:59.624 --> 10:01.124
I got you.

10:03.582 --> 10:05.207
My fucking blackberry.

10:30.707 --> 10:32.207
Dad, what are you doing here?

10:32.374 --> 10:34.124
Uh, hmm.

10:34.291 --> 10:37.374
Oh, yeah, I own the place.
Cherie, this is my son, Eric.

10:37.541 --> 10:39.749
Hi.
He's told me all about you.

10:41.874 --> 10:42.957
Ah, yeah.

10:43.124 --> 10:45.332
Great party. Thanks for
letting us sleep it off.

10:45.499 --> 10:47.124
No problem.

10:47.291 --> 10:49.999
Hm. It must have been
quite a flesh.

10:50.166 --> 10:51.332
Oh, yeah, I guess so.

10:51.499 --> 10:53.166
Did the best I could
with the turds.

10:53.332 --> 10:56.832
I know you did, Bill. I wish you would
have let me know you were coming out.

10:56.999 --> 10:59.041
Maybe we can throw someone
down on a couch.

10:59.207 --> 11:00.666
Ah, we're not staying.

11:00.832 --> 11:05.207
I just came out for the day to do a
meet-and-greet with the brokers.

11:05.374 --> 11:06.457
Brokers?

11:06.624 --> 11:08.416
You got the message, right?

11:08.582 --> 11:10.499
I saw that you called.

11:10.666 --> 11:12.666
I'm putting the house
on the market.

11:13.666 --> 11:15.749
What? Wait, you're selling
our house?

11:16.916 --> 11:20.207
Ah, I'm hardly ever
out here any more.

11:20.374 --> 11:22.832
It's time to unload.

11:22.999 --> 11:24.249
But hey, what about me?

11:24.416 --> 11:28.457
I'm always out here.
My friends are always out here.

11:29.082 --> 11:30.832
So make me an offer.

11:31.499 --> 11:33.082
Ah. Ha-ha-ha.

11:33.416 --> 11:35.624
Dad, come on.
I don't ask you for anything.

11:35.791 --> 11:37.666
How about this?
We go get breakfast.

11:37.832 --> 11:39.457
We talk over
the house situation.

11:39.624 --> 11:41.707
Maybe we all can chip in
for utilities?

11:41.874 --> 11:43.791
Ah, I'm a little pressed
for time, kiddo.

11:44.499 --> 11:48.457
We're gonna go play a quick nine
and then goth get back.

11:48.624 --> 11:50.332
Cherie's never played before.

11:50.499 --> 11:51.790
I'm so excited.

11:51.957 --> 11:53.457
Dad, this is fucking bullshit.

11:53.624 --> 11:56.624
I'll call you next week.
We'll do yoga.

12:07.957 --> 12:10.582
I've said it before
and I'll say it again.

12:10.749 --> 12:13.332
Your dad is a selfish prick.

12:13.499 --> 12:15.457
Smoothie?
Ooh.

12:15.624 --> 12:17.665
It's gonna be sad
not coming out here.

12:17.832 --> 12:20.249
Me and Willy might not
even be around next summer.

12:20.415 --> 12:22.749
The L.A. thing again?
Are you serious?

12:22.915 --> 12:24.915
You just moved into
that place in Brooklyn.

12:25.082 --> 12:27.332
But Willow's doing really
good with her acting.

12:27.499 --> 12:30.207
She did that Pizza Hut
Latin America commercial.

12:30.374 --> 12:32.415
<i>Ooh, deliciosa!</i>

12:33.915 --> 12:36.582
Her dad is gonna hook me up
with a job at a big law firm.

12:36.749 --> 12:37.957
What about the album?

12:38.124 --> 12:40.124
I'll work on the album
while I'm doing law.

12:40.290 --> 12:42.624
Yeah? Will you?
You know what I'm excited about?

12:42.790 --> 12:45.665
Throwing one of these parties
in my one-bedroom apartment.

12:45.832 --> 12:47.165
That'll be fun, right?

12:47.332 --> 12:49.749
Maybe I can put
the food out on the fire escape.

12:49.915 --> 12:51.707
- Eric.
- The band in the bathroom.

12:51.874 --> 12:53.207
I have to get more outlets.

12:53.374 --> 12:55.665
I'll get a power strip.
Why not? I'll splurge.

12:55.832 --> 12:57.249
Eric.
What?

12:57.415 --> 12:58.749
This is a major moment.

12:58.915 --> 13:01.457
It's okay to let the hurt in.

13:01.624 --> 13:04.665
To allow yourself to actually
be present in a moment.

13:04.832 --> 13:07.582
Okay, thanks, doc. You really
make the moment more real

13:07.749 --> 13:10.374
by talking about how real
the moment is in the middle.

13:10.540 --> 13:13.540
No, I understand.
You're probably feeling

13:13.707 --> 13:15.915
some anger and some
misdirected frustra...

13:17.707 --> 13:19.707
Feel better now?
A little bit, yeah.

13:19.874 --> 13:21.499
Dude, that was awesome.
Oh, fuck!

13:21.665 --> 13:22.707
Oh!

13:22.874 --> 13:24.207
What about now?

13:24.374 --> 13:25.499
Oh, much better.

13:25.665 --> 13:27.290
Now I'm in the moment.

13:28.915 --> 13:31.040
<i>I don't
understand summer school.</i>

13:31.207 --> 13:33.832
Isn't the point of being a teacher
that you get summers off?

13:33.999 --> 13:37.165
Well, they pay us poop, so,
what am I gonna do, waitress?

13:37.332 --> 13:39.832
Oh, my God, the big news.

13:39.957 --> 13:43.165
So the principal told me today

13:43.332 --> 13:48.749
that the friendship bracelets that the girls
are wearing are actually sex bracelets.

13:48.915 --> 13:49.999
Hmm.
What?

13:50.165 --> 13:52.165
I saw something
about that on Oprah.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.499
Girls wear these different
color bracelets

13:54.665 --> 13:57.499
and every color represents,
like, a sex thing.

13:57.665 --> 14:00.165
So if you tear off a girl's
blue bracelet,

14:00.332 --> 14:02.165
that means
she has to give you oral.

14:02.332 --> 14:03.999
Yup.
What's a yellow bracelet?

14:04.165 --> 14:05.290
Uh, a hug.

14:05.457 --> 14:06.749
Aww.
Oh, sweet.

14:06.915 --> 14:08.999
I know.
What about purple?

14:09.165 --> 14:10.165
Teabagging?

14:10.332 --> 14:11.915
Oh!

14:12.082 --> 14:13.165
Really?

14:13.332 --> 14:15.290
Well, what is teabagging?

14:15.457 --> 14:16.499
Balls in mouth.

14:16.665 --> 14:18.290
Oh, no!

14:18.457 --> 14:21.165
Teabagging?
What is with the kids today?

14:21.332 --> 14:23.999
Well, the blowjob
is the new French kiss.

14:24.165 --> 14:26.124
Wow, we really missed
the boat on that one.

14:26.290 --> 14:28.957
I feel like if we had had
sex bracelets back then,

14:29.124 --> 14:30.707
no one would have
torn mine off.

14:30.874 --> 14:33.082
Ohh. No, no, no, sweetie.

14:33.249 --> 14:35.457
I would have torn off
your BJ bracelet.

14:35.624 --> 14:38.249
You're just saying that,
but thanks, Eric.

14:38.415 --> 14:40.040
Thanks for letting me blow you.

14:40.207 --> 14:42.457
- You're welcome.
- You're a good friend.

14:46.790 --> 14:49.290
- Hey, Dody.
Mm-hm?

14:52.457 --> 14:54.790
Hi. Can I help you?

14:54.957 --> 14:56.582
Are you Eric?
Yes.

14:56.749 --> 14:58.749
Hi. We spoke on the phone.

14:58.915 --> 15:01.582
I'm Dody Henderson from
the Henderson Realty Group.

15:01.749 --> 15:03.665
And this is my associate
Kelly Tanner.

15:03.832 --> 15:06.249
Hi. How are you?
Hi.

15:07.624 --> 15:08.665
No, thank you.

15:08.832 --> 15:09.915
Lame.

15:10.082 --> 15:11.082
Oh, I shouldn't.
Mm-hm.

15:12.415 --> 15:15.165
We can't wait
to get your house sold.

15:15.332 --> 15:17.582
We need this place
clean, clean every day.

15:17.748 --> 15:19.248
Water the lawns, skim the pool.

15:19.373 --> 15:23.665
You never know when buyers are gonna
stop by to say hi and buy, buy.

15:23.832 --> 15:25.623
Oh, B-U-Y! Ha, ha!

15:25.790 --> 15:27.832
Whatever.

15:27.998 --> 15:31.915
Oh, and make sure the toilets
are clean enough to eat out of.

15:32.082 --> 15:33.582
Yeah, whatever.

15:34.082 --> 15:36.873
Maybe I should sprinkle some
rose petals on the driveway too.

15:37.040 --> 15:38.582
Just do what you can.

15:38.748 --> 15:41.290
Will do.
Wow.

15:41.457 --> 15:44.748
What are the chances of maybe selling
this sometime after Labor Day?

15:45.540 --> 15:48.040
You wanna sell a summer home
during the summer.

15:48.207 --> 15:49.415
That's kind of the point.

15:50.290 --> 15:52.332
So glad we're in
business together.

15:52.498 --> 15:53.748
<i>Om shanti.</i>

15:54.540 --> 15:56.248
<i>Om shanti it is.</i>

15:59.665 --> 16:02.207
Vultures.
Yeesh.

16:03.540 --> 16:06.082
It's light. It's light.

16:06.248 --> 16:08.373
We should put it up closer.
Like there?

16:08.540 --> 16:11.915
Oh, yeah.
That'll bring in all the right clientele.

16:20.998 --> 16:24.248
Listen. Have you given any more thought
to the final Labor Day blowout?

16:24.415 --> 16:25.582
I really don't know.

16:25.748 --> 16:28.123
I mean, obviously,
we goth do something huge.

16:28.290 --> 16:30.582
But what do you do
for a final blowout?

16:30.748 --> 16:33.332
Go out in a blaze of glory.
Heads held high.

16:33.498 --> 16:34.915
I get it.
Deserved.

16:35.082 --> 16:36.832
Holy shit. Oh, shit.
Here we go. Bingo.

16:36.998 --> 16:38.832
What?
I got the concept right here.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.415
Brown party...

16:40.998 --> 16:42.082
Brown party.-
Brown party...

16:42.248 --> 16:44.373
Brown clothes, brown food,
brown drink,

16:44.540 --> 16:47.082
brown clown, brown balloons,

16:47.248 --> 16:49.582
live music supplied by
Jackson Browne.

16:49.748 --> 16:51.998
I don't know what you're
thinking. Is that good?

16:52.165 --> 16:53.290
It's fucking awful.

16:53.457 --> 16:56.082
Take it easy.
I'm just spit balling.

16:56.248 --> 16:58.332
It's not like you're throwing
ideas my way.

16:58.498 --> 17:00.623
He spells with an E at the end.
Doesn't matter.

17:00.790 --> 17:03.415
Holy shit.
We got a situation here.

17:03.582 --> 17:05.290
Oh, my fucking God.

17:05.457 --> 17:07.707
Dude, she's wearing
a sex bracelet.

17:07.873 --> 17:09.207
Holy fuck, she is.

17:09.373 --> 17:11.665
Oh, boy, that's trouble.

17:11.832 --> 17:14.123
It's blue. It's blue.
Sword swallower.

17:14.290 --> 17:17.165
When she reaches out for my
cone, I'm gonna snag that thing

17:17.332 --> 17:19.457
and it's deep-throat city
all night long.

17:19.623 --> 17:20.915
No, no, no.

17:21.082 --> 17:23.998
Please don't do that.
Don't. No, stop.

17:24.165 --> 17:25.873
Stop. Stop it.

17:27.540 --> 17:30.540
I bet she unhinges her jaw like a
fucking python swallowing a rat.

17:30.707 --> 17:33.457
Um, do you guys
know what you want?

17:33.623 --> 17:35.707
Yes, we do.
Yeah. We got a pretty good idea.

17:35.873 --> 17:37.457
No, ice cream
is what we're into.

17:40.457 --> 17:44.165
Do you think a girl like that looks at
us like we're a couple of old dudes?

17:44.332 --> 17:47.582
The way we used to look at 30-year-old
guys back in high school and say,

17:47.748 --> 17:51.248
'Oh, man, look at that
lame old guy hitting on Sue.'

17:51.415 --> 17:53.998
Ha, ha. Yeah, probably.

17:54.165 --> 17:56.873
I don't know. Weren't 30-year-old
guys a lot older back then

17:57.040 --> 17:58.582
with, like, mustaches and jobs?

17:58.748 --> 18:00.915
Yeah
It certainly seemed like it

18:02.290 --> 18:03.332
What?

18:03.498 --> 18:05.623
Fuck, dude, we're getting old.
Bullshit. Come on.

18:05.790 --> 18:08.123
I got a foot cramp
the other day masturbating.

18:08.290 --> 18:11.248
What? Doesn't make sense.
I swear to God. It happened.

18:11.415 --> 18:14.582
Do you think that girl and her
friends really have BJ orgy parties?

18:14.748 --> 18:15.915
Indubitably- Really?

18:16.082 --> 18:18.082
Duquez is right.
We got fucking hosed.

18:18.248 --> 18:20.207
God dang.

18:21.248 --> 18:23.082
Hey, what about that?

18:23.248 --> 18:24.207
What about what?

18:24.373 --> 18:26.082
What about that
for the final party?

18:26.248 --> 18:28.415
What?
An orgy.

18:28.582 --> 18:30.040
An orgy? An orgy...

18:30.207 --> 18:31.707
You wanna have an orgy?
Why not?

18:31.873 --> 18:33.540
Get out of town.
It'll never happen.

18:33.707 --> 18:34.957
Why not?
Why not?

18:35.123 --> 18:37.207
Because people don't
have orgies, you know?

18:37.373 --> 18:38.790
Oh, come on. They used to.

18:38.957 --> 18:40.748
True.
Yeah, think about it, dude.

18:40.915 --> 18:43.790
An orgy.
A good old-fashioned orgy.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.623
Wowie.
That is a blaze of glory.

18:46.790 --> 18:49.748
Okay. Now you know
I hate naysayers, right?

18:49.915 --> 18:51.373
But I'm gonna have to say nay.

18:51.540 --> 18:52.873
Really?
Really.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.623
Are you throwing down
the gauntlet?

18:54.790 --> 18:56.706
Oops, what's that?

18:56.873 --> 18:59.165
It's on the ground as we speak.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.373
We're gonna have an orgy.

19:03.706 --> 19:05.248
We're gonna have an orgy.

19:05.456 --> 19:07.248
Oh, boy. Here we go.

19:08.831 --> 19:10.831
Okay, guys,
I've been mulling it over

19:10.998 --> 19:12.915
and I have a concept
for the final flesh.

19:13.081 --> 19:14.831
All right.
What is it?

19:14.998 --> 19:16.331
- Whoo!
- Fiesta

19:16.498 --> 19:18.498
While this will be
the most spectacular

19:18.665 --> 19:22.831
and insane party any of us have taken
part of, it's not gonna be a big thing.

19:22.998 --> 19:24.248
It's just gonna be us.

19:24.415 --> 19:29.331
It's gonna be small,
intimate, special.

19:29.498 --> 19:31.248
Oh, I'll make lasagna.

19:31.415 --> 19:33.915
- Yummy.
- Oh, yeah.

19:34.081 --> 19:35.331
We're gonna have an orgy.

19:39.248 --> 19:41.206
Who?
Us.

19:42.498 --> 19:45.165
Where?
Right here. Labor Day weekend.

19:45.331 --> 19:49.206
Us? A naked sex orgy?

19:49.373 --> 19:51.831
You're kidding, right?
No, I'm not. Why not us?

19:51.998 --> 19:53.790
People used to have them
all the time.

19:53.956 --> 19:55.123
All the time.

19:55.290 --> 19:56.790
What happened
to our generation?

19:56.956 --> 19:59.165
What happened?
I'll tell you what happened.

19:59.331 --> 20:02.040
AIDS.
AIDS.

20:02.206 --> 20:03.790
AIDS hit right
when we hit puberty.

20:03.956 --> 20:05.998
And it scared the shit
out of all of us.

20:06.165 --> 20:10.123
It turned sex into this big,
frightening thing.

20:10.290 --> 20:11.623
He's right.

20:11.790 --> 20:15.456
Kids today are freaks,
our parents were freaks,

20:15.623 --> 20:17.206
we're a bunch of
fucking pussies.

20:17.373 --> 20:19.956
- We're the lamest generation.
- This is our chance.

20:20.123 --> 20:21.331
Our chance to do it right.

20:21.498 --> 20:23.498
Take back what's
been taken from us.

20:23.665 --> 20:25.998
Isn't that from Goonies?
I am paraphrasing Goonies.

20:26.165 --> 20:28.790
Orgy. Orgy...

20:28.915 --> 20:32.748
Orgy. Orgy. Orgy.

20:32.915 --> 20:35.206
Duquez, come on.
You're into this, right?

20:35.373 --> 20:38.665
What? Heh-heh-heh. No.

20:38.831 --> 20:41.790
We're all friends.
It would just be too weird.

20:41.956 --> 20:44.831
How do you know unless you try?
Ew!

20:44.998 --> 20:49.581
If we all went into this with an
open mind, it could be amazing.

20:49.748 --> 20:52.915
In theory,
a noble call to arms.

20:53.081 --> 20:57.748
In practice, I cannot
imagine a more awkward

20:57.915 --> 20:59.915
and uncomfortably
terrible evening.

21:00.081 --> 21:02.831
Oh, laugh, laugh,
laugh all you want.

21:02.998 --> 21:05.206
Seriously, don't you get it?
This is it,

21:05.373 --> 21:08.415
the final blowout,
and then the house is gone.

21:08.581 --> 21:11.873
People move away.
Things change.

21:12.040 --> 21:14.456
We need to think
outside of the box.

21:14.623 --> 21:17.540
And inside the box.

21:17.706 --> 21:18.915
Eww.

21:19.081 --> 21:21.123
Mike, that's not
what I'm going for.

21:21.290 --> 21:22.581
I'm in.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.165
What?
What?

21:24.331 --> 21:25.373
Are you serious?

21:25.540 --> 21:27.623
Yes, it worked. Ha-ha-ha.

21:27.790 --> 21:29.540
Come on. An orgy?

21:29.706 --> 21:31.040
It's madness.

21:31.206 --> 21:34.248
Ugh.
It's gonna be a fucking blast.

21:34.415 --> 21:35.915
Success!
Success!

21:36.081 --> 21:38.206
Sue's in.
Thank you, yes.

21:38.373 --> 21:39.373
Here we go.
Come on.

21:39.540 --> 21:42.206
I'm gonna go meet Marcus.
Oh, my God.

21:42.373 --> 21:44.915
All right, think it over.
Think it... Everybody, okay.

21:45.081 --> 21:46.373
All right, I get it.

21:46.540 --> 21:49.373
It's gonna hike a while to come
around on this whole orgy idea.

21:49.540 --> 21:51.540
Right? Here?
No, okay. Ha, ha!

21:51.706 --> 21:55.415
Very good, but go ahead, type it in your
BlackBerrys, pencil it in your notebooks.

21:55.581 --> 21:57.873
Orgy. Orgy.

21:58.040 --> 22:00.165
<i>Orgy. Orgy.</i>

22:00.331 --> 22:03.331
<i>Orgy. Orgy. Orgy.</i>

22:09.415 --> 22:12.915
So, Sue, you think this is how you're
gonna finally sleep with Eric?

22:13.081 --> 22:15.998
What? We dated
in high school.

22:16.164 --> 22:17.706
Come on, that was ages ago.

22:17.873 --> 22:19.623
You guys never,
you know, did it,

22:19.789 --> 22:21.581
so it's kind of
unfinished business.

22:21.748 --> 22:25.081
Yeah, but I've slept with
like a ton of guys since then,

22:25.248 --> 22:27.748
so this doesn't have
anything to do with it.

22:27.914 --> 22:30.664
Fine, but other
than social awkwardness,

22:30.831 --> 22:31.998
give me one reason.

22:32.164 --> 22:35.248
Oh, very well. How about
I give you several reasons?

22:35.414 --> 22:36.956
Like, oh, I don't know,

22:37.123 --> 22:38.789
chlamydia, the herp,

22:38.956 --> 22:42.789
gonorrhea, syphilis, papilloma.

22:42.956 --> 22:44.289
The Steve McQueen movie?

22:44.456 --> 22:48.123
No, that's Papillon.
The virus that causes genital warts.

22:48.289 --> 22:50.456
Ugh. Why do you think
of this stuff?

22:50.623 --> 22:53.623
Don't you remember the article my
mom clipped from The New Yorker?

22:56.373 --> 22:57.623
No.

22:57.789 --> 23:00.164
Condoms can't stop it
and it causes cervical cancer.

23:00.331 --> 23:02.206
You don't have a cervix.

23:02.789 --> 23:06.498
I don't know how you could have sex
in front of a room full of people.

23:06.664 --> 23:09.789
I mean, I don't even like
to get naked at the spa.

23:09.956 --> 23:12.789
I'm not saying that this is
gonna be easy for me,

23:12.956 --> 23:15.914
but isn't that what
kind of makes it exciting?

23:16.081 --> 23:18.623
I'm not saying that
it wouldn't be fun,

23:18.789 --> 23:20.748
but it's an orgy.

23:20.914 --> 23:22.956
What's the point of
losing all this weight

23:23.123 --> 23:25.081
if you're not gonna show off
your new bod?

23:25.206 --> 23:26.998
You haven't even worn
your bikini yet.

23:27.164 --> 23:28.581
I still have 5 more pounds.

23:28.748 --> 23:31.581
I think this could help
build your self-esteem.

23:31.748 --> 23:37.164
There's the miracle cure. I'm gonna start turning
my clients onto group sex instead of Zoloft.

23:37.331 --> 23:39.539
We're going to the beach.
At least do that.

23:39.706 --> 23:41.748
It's our last summer.
Let's go to the beach.

23:41.914 --> 23:45.414
Shockingly, I'm gonna pass on the
stroll through the tick-infested dunes.

23:46.081 --> 23:47.581
Dude, I've had Lyme disease.

23:47.748 --> 23:50.248
It's not a big deal.
It's antibiotics, boom, done.

23:50.414 --> 23:53.623
You know I have a needle phobia.
Okay? I can't go to the doctor.

23:53.789 --> 23:56.414
The puncturing
the veins and the... Ugh.

23:56.581 --> 23:59.039
Okay, whatever.
Enjoy the great indoors.

23:59.206 --> 24:01.373
Yeah. Bye.
Okay.

24:01.539 --> 24:04.873
Ooh, hey, Eric. Uh, could you
grab some sand for my ass crack?

24:05.039 --> 24:06.581
I'll grab some for your cervix.

24:08.706 --> 24:11.039
Okay. Let's say you dated
four guys in one year,

24:11.206 --> 24:13.206
right, and you slept with them.

24:13.373 --> 24:15.539
You'd be cool with that?
Totally.

24:15.706 --> 24:18.748
And how many guys
have you slept with this year?

24:19.539 --> 24:21.539
None.

24:21.706 --> 24:23.081
Or the year before.

24:23.248 --> 24:26.581
So really all you're doing
is sleeping with four guys

24:26.748 --> 24:29.123
in, like, a shorter time frame.

24:30.248 --> 24:32.414
I never really thought
of it that way.

24:33.581 --> 24:34.623
What do you think?

24:34.789 --> 24:37.914
Insane, idiotic
and self-destructive.

24:39.831 --> 24:41.998
Okay, hypothetically.
Mm-hm.

24:42.164 --> 24:45.998
If I did decide to do it,
but at the last minute,

24:46.164 --> 24:48.289
I totally freaked out,

24:48.456 --> 24:51.414
they would let me out, right?

24:51.581 --> 24:53.831
Laura, it's an orgy,
not The Accused.

24:53.998 --> 24:57.081
It's not fun
unless everybody's into it.

24:59.456 --> 25:01.081
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it.

25:01.248 --> 25:03.498
I'm gonna do it.
Yeah? Yeah?

25:03.664 --> 25:05.706
I'm gonna do it.
All right. Yeah, girl.

25:05.873 --> 25:08.039
Hey, guys,
what's the celebration?

25:09.998 --> 25:12.664
Just talking about how to get
Laura back in the saddle.

25:12.831 --> 25:15.414
Whoo, yay!
I'm gonna find you a guy.

25:15.956 --> 25:18.331
Glenn's cousin Frank
is coming to the wedding.

25:22.289 --> 25:24.289
Okay, Game on. Let's go.

25:24.456 --> 25:25.623
All right, John Kruk.

25:25.789 --> 25:29.248
I'll tell you what I'm gonna throw,
and you're still gonna whiff at it.

25:29.456 --> 25:32.123
Slow breaking curveball.

25:33.123 --> 25:34.164
Oh!

25:34.331 --> 25:36.331
Goddamn it! I dare you
to throw that again.

25:36.498 --> 25:39.456
Swish full, the nerd's revenge.

25:39.623 --> 25:41.539
Ooh, I got my bunt face on.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.997
Drills, ladies. Drills.
Let's go. Look alive.

25:44.164 --> 25:45.497
Album cover, hat or no hat?

25:45.664 --> 25:47.622
Oh, Doug, come on, man.

25:47.789 --> 25:49.664
You've been doing this
for two years.

25:49.831 --> 25:52.289
Mixing, remixing.
Hatting, no hatting.

25:52.456 --> 25:54.581
Your music's awesome.
Get it out there.

25:54.747 --> 25:58.539
No one will give it a shot if they don't dig my look.
It's an image-based industry.

25:58.706 --> 26:02.081
What the fuck? This is why
you're headed for a shitty job.

26:02.247 --> 26:05.747
You need to stop trying to look like a
rock star and shirt living like one.

26:05.914 --> 26:07.331
Yeah, do the orgy.
Do the orgy.

26:07.497 --> 26:08.956
You think Mick Jagger
would have said,

26:09.122 --> 26:11.164
'No thanks, mate.
No orgy for me.

26:11.331 --> 26:12.997
I've got an on-again-off-again
girlfriend.'

26:13.164 --> 26:15.289
'I don't
wanna cheat on David Bowie.'

26:15.456 --> 26:17.581
'No cheating on Bowie.'
Hey, Willow.

26:18.997 --> 26:20.664
I know what Tom Hanks
feels like now.

26:20.831 --> 26:22.747
My only concern, Duque,

26:22.914 --> 26:25.247
is that the hat doesn't
make you look gay enough.

26:25.414 --> 26:26.581
Oh, yeah.

26:26.747 --> 26:29.331
You could Photoshop in three
guys jizzing on your face?

26:29.497 --> 26:31.914
Or on the hat?
Ooh, ooh.

26:32.081 --> 26:33.289
That's good.
Hey.

26:33.456 --> 26:37.914
You could take that five-song demo, make it a double album.
One with the hat, one without it?

26:38.081 --> 26:40.164
<i>You could call it, uh,
Exile on Hat Street.</i>

26:40.331 --> 26:43.706
<i>Yeah, or Jagged Little Hat?
Oh, Meat Loaf. Hat Outta Hell.</i>

26:43.872 --> 26:46.789
<i>Lonely Hats Club Hat?</i>

26:46.956 --> 26:50.581
<i>What if I just call it My Shitty
Friends Don't Respect Me?</i>

26:51.539 --> 26:53.706
Indie. You won't be able
to sell at Walmart.

26:53.872 --> 26:56.914
- Who's next up to hat?
- Two and two to Harvey Key.

26:57.081 --> 26:59.706
Sandy winds up and delivers.

27:00.706 --> 27:02.747
Ooh, hoo-hoo-hoo!
Fuck me.

27:02.914 --> 27:04.372
Hey, Ali Cat.
Hi.

27:04.539 --> 27:05.747
Like what you see?

27:05.914 --> 27:07.956
This could be all yours
Labor Day weekend.

27:08.122 --> 27:09.872
Oh, Eric.

27:10.039 --> 27:11.789
Do you mind if
I make an observation?

27:11.956 --> 27:14.914
Oh, boy. Sure, go ahead.

27:15.081 --> 27:17.039
You have intimacy issues.

27:17.164 --> 27:18.372
Really? Yeah.

27:18.539 --> 27:20.872
I figured an orgy is
as intimate as it can get.

27:21.039 --> 27:23.872
No, no, no, but intimacy
isn't about intercourse, Eric.

27:24.039 --> 27:25.289
It's about emotion.
Mm-hm.

27:25.456 --> 27:28.247
You don't need to get laid.
You need to be in a relationship.

27:28.414 --> 27:32.331
Heh, heh. Look, just because
you're in an unhappy relationship,

27:33.206 --> 27:34.997
doesn't mean
the rest of us need to be.

27:35.164 --> 27:36.997
I'm not in an unhappy
relationship.

27:37.164 --> 27:40.039
I'm in an adult relationship.

27:40.206 --> 27:42.164
It's fun, whatever it is.
Hold on one sec?

27:42.331 --> 27:45.372
Hey, Marcus. You want
to hike a few cracks with the bat?

27:45.539 --> 27:46.831
No, thank you.

27:46.997 --> 27:49.997
Football is my game,
European football.

27:50.164 --> 27:51.456
Gotcha.

27:51.622 --> 27:53.872
Did he date Siegfried or Roy?
I can't remember.

27:54.039 --> 27:56.331
Oh!

27:56.497 --> 27:59.247
God, it's embarrassing
watching you play this sport.

27:59.414 --> 28:02.164
Aww, it's cow shit.

28:02.331 --> 28:05.164
Look, doc, it's your life.

28:05.331 --> 28:06.706
You can do whatever you want.

28:06.831 --> 28:09.122
All I'm saying is that maybe
Labor Day weekend

28:09.289 --> 28:11.581
might be the last chopper
out of Saigon for you.

28:19.914 --> 28:22.206
Knock, knock.
Guess who.

28:22.372 --> 28:24.164
Dody! Ha-ha-ha.

28:24.331 --> 28:26.622
These are the Webers.
How you doing?

28:27.164 --> 28:28.997
We brought some extra signs

28:29.164 --> 28:30.831
because someone
is stealing ours.

28:30.997 --> 28:32.664
Oh. That's too bad.

28:33.539 --> 28:36.164
Oh, good. Okay.
Hey, guys. Do me a favor?

28:36.331 --> 28:39.456
When you go in the house, don't
go to the basement or anything.

28:39.622 --> 28:43.789
Not that there's anything or anyone
down there in a cage or otherwise.

28:43.956 --> 28:46.956
Thanks, Eric.
That's so helpful.

28:47.122 --> 28:48.289
What is he talking about?

28:48.414 --> 28:51.289
Oh, gosh. Don't worry. Don't worry.

28:51.456 --> 28:54.747
He's a little off.

28:54.914 --> 28:56.164
It's a head injury.

28:56.331 --> 28:58.414
That's why he wears the helmet.

28:58.581 --> 29:01.081
Are they all challenged?

29:01.747 --> 29:04.247
Yes. But at least
they have each other.

29:04.372 --> 29:07.581
Oh, that's so great.

29:07.747 --> 29:10.289
Have fun with your game,
sweetie.

29:10.456 --> 29:11.914
Thanks, Mrs. Weber.

29:13.205 --> 29:16.455
We are five minutes
from Indian Wells Beach.

29:16.622 --> 29:18.830
And wait till you see
your bedroom.

29:57.039 --> 29:59.539
What if someone comes in?
These people never knock.

29:59.705 --> 30:02.122
I just locked the door.

30:02.289 --> 30:06.122
Fine, but you really
must be quiet.

30:06.289 --> 30:07.622
None of your usual screeches.

30:07.789 --> 30:09.372
Okay, okay, okay.
Yes?

30:09.539 --> 30:11.580
Yeah.

30:13.955 --> 30:16.497
Oh, Marcus. Oh...

30:16.664 --> 30:19.164
Let's get you out
of these dirty little panties.

30:19.330 --> 30:21.330
Do it. What?

30:21.455 --> 30:24.830
What's going on? Why are you stopping?
What's going on? Hey.

30:24.997 --> 30:26.497
What?

30:27.164 --> 30:28.705
What have you done
to your vagina?

30:30.330 --> 30:31.497
I shaved it.

30:37.497 --> 30:40.372
Why?
I don't know.

30:40.539 --> 30:45.039
Because I thought it would be
something different, sexy.

30:45.205 --> 30:48.789
Women are supposed to have pubic hair.
Why would I find it sexy?

30:48.955 --> 30:51.039
You look like
a prepubescent girl.

30:51.205 --> 30:52.580
I'm not a child molester.

30:52.747 --> 30:55.789
Okay, you know what, it's hair,
Marcus, and it's gonna grow back.

30:57.122 --> 30:59.372
Well, I wished you
would have told me

30:59.539 --> 31:02.039
about your little secret
before I unwrapped this.

31:02.205 --> 31:04.622
This lambskin condoms
cost 2 Euros.

31:04.789 --> 31:06.455
It's wasteful.

31:07.497 --> 31:08.664
I did it for you!

31:08.830 --> 31:10.789
You could have
consulted with me.

31:14.455 --> 31:17.455
Alison, you're being
like a child.

31:17.580 --> 31:20.039
Fuck you, go away!

31:20.205 --> 31:22.122
You go away.

31:22.289 --> 31:23.622
I think this is chemical.

31:23.789 --> 31:25.622
Darling, what dosage
are you inking?

31:25.789 --> 31:27.955
You... Fuck you!

31:28.122 --> 31:29.455
This is your problem.

31:29.622 --> 31:33.039
I was just expressing my
sexuality in a healthy manner.

31:33.205 --> 31:37.080
God forbid, Marcus,
that we experiment a little bit.

31:37.247 --> 31:38.497
Fine.

31:38.664 --> 31:42.580
I'm going back to the city
and I'm taking the iPod.

31:42.747 --> 31:44.997
Fine. Leave!

31:45.164 --> 31:47.455
And your breath is terrible!

31:47.622 --> 31:50.622
My breath is natural.
Unlike your vagina.

31:51.580 --> 31:53.122
Fuck you!

31:59.247 --> 32:01.664
Oh. Jesus.

32:02.580 --> 32:03.580
Sorry.

32:03.747 --> 32:05.955
Ahem. It's all right.

32:09.747 --> 32:12.164
The worst part is
I'm just peeing right now.

32:29.789 --> 32:31.497
I've been kicking
around a few ideas.

32:31.664 --> 32:33.539
Party themes.
Let me know what you think.

32:33.705 --> 32:36.997
First one, Roman, right?
You're talking togas, wine,

32:37.164 --> 32:39.372
bushels of grapes,
the whole deal.

32:39.539 --> 32:41.413
Then I also have '70s, right?

32:41.580 --> 32:45.038
We got the swinger vibe,
polyester, big hair,

32:45.205 --> 32:48.038
upstairs and down, you know?
Um, I don't know.

32:48.205 --> 32:50.622
What about the Kama Sutra?

32:50.788 --> 32:52.205
That's actually not bad.
Yeah?

32:52.372 --> 32:55.080
Yeah, yeah, like the sex secrets
of the East, right?

32:55.247 --> 32:57.205
Mm-hm.
Oh, that's... Yeah.

32:57.372 --> 33:01.122
You know you have like,
uh, incense, tapestries.

33:01.288 --> 33:03.788
Veils, diaphanous fabrics.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:03.955 --> 33:06.705
I have no idea what the hell
that is, but I like it.

33:06.872 --> 33:09.038
You and me, we're on the
same page with this.

33:09.205 --> 33:11.538
Right? I think so.
Absolutely.

33:11.705 --> 33:13.872
How do you spell 'Kama'?
Yeah.

33:14.038 --> 33:15.497
Dude, babe alert at 3 o'clock.

33:15.663 --> 33:17.497
Three o'clock.
My 3, my 3.

33:22.663 --> 33:23.830
Wait.
That hurls my dink.

33:23.997 --> 33:25.330
Wait a minute.
That's Kelly.

33:25.497 --> 33:27.997
Who?
My Realtor.

33:28.122 --> 33:29.705
Oh, shit, the enemy.

33:30.372 --> 33:32.080
Listen to me. Listen.

33:32.247 --> 33:35.163
We cannot afford to lose the casa
de sex before Labor Day, okay?

33:35.330 --> 33:38.247
You go over there, you get in
tight with her, lay on the charm,

33:38.413 --> 33:40.330
and get her to drag ass
selling the house.

33:40.497 --> 33:41.788
No, no, that is...
Yes, yes.

33:41.955 --> 33:44.247
She is a tough cookie.
She'll see through that.

33:44.413 --> 33:46.372
Her? Please, dude,
you're the king.

33:46.538 --> 33:49.830
A little winey-diney, she'll
be your humble wench servant.

33:50.788 --> 33:52.788
Keep friends close,
but enemies closer.

33:52.955 --> 33:56.247
Yeah. That doesn't make any sense.
Just go fucking charm her, okay?

33:56.580 --> 33:57.955
Okay.
Go, go, go.

33:58.122 --> 33:59.372
All right.
Do the thing.

33:59.538 --> 34:02.788
What?
The smile thing. Ahem.

34:03.788 --> 34:06.955
Kelly. Kelly. Hi.
Oh, Eric.

34:08.663 --> 34:10.371
Oh, my God, look at this.
Watch.

34:10.538 --> 34:13.580
I hope anything I said didn't screw
anything up with the client.

34:13.746 --> 34:15.871
I was joking around.
I didn't freak them out?

34:16.038 --> 34:17.705
Oh, no. Not at all.
Oh, good.

34:17.871 --> 34:20.580
You were wearing that helmet
so I was able to convince them

34:20.746 --> 34:23.580
that, you know,
you ride the short bus.

34:23.746 --> 34:25.413
Well, that's good.

34:25.580 --> 34:26.955
Yeah. Thanks.
Well played.

34:27.121 --> 34:29.455
Hey, do you mind if...?
Maybe I can make up to you.

34:29.621 --> 34:31.413
Take you out to dinner
or something?

34:31.580 --> 34:33.455
Could be fun, yeah?
Oh, gosh, thanks.

34:33.621 --> 34:37.746
Um, technically, I'm not supposed
to go out with clients so..

34:37.913 --> 34:40.830
Well, technically
my dad's the client.

34:40.996 --> 34:43.830
Right now I'm just some
random dude on the beach.

34:43.996 --> 34:46.496
She's smiling. Look, she's smiling.
She's buying it.

34:46.663 --> 34:48.996
Okay. I'll go to dinner
with you.

34:49.163 --> 34:50.246
All right.

34:50.413 --> 34:52.580
But, tell me which party
we met at.

34:52.746 --> 34:54.913
Was it one of my parties?
Mm-hm.

34:55.080 --> 34:56.705
Okay. What, um...

34:56.871 --> 34:59.247
Oh, was it the
Cuba Libre party because

34:59.413 --> 35:01.622
I was in mojito haze
that whole day and I just...

35:01.788 --> 35:03.163
<i>-</i> Nope.

35:03.330 --> 35:04.663
Oktoberfest in July?

35:04.788 --> 35:06.705
Nope.
Oh, oh, no, no, I know.

35:06.872 --> 35:07.955
I know.

35:08.122 --> 35:11.372
Uh, it was the Shir Trek versus Shir
Wars Battle for the Universe Party

35:11.538 --> 35:14.372
and you were dressed
as Obi-Wan Kenobi.

35:14.538 --> 35:16.872
How drunk do you get
at these parties?

35:17.038 --> 35:19.872
Uh, pretty drunk.
It's kind of a social obligation.

35:20.038 --> 35:22.622
Okay. I'm gonna
give you a hint.

35:22.788 --> 35:24.372
I wear a size 9 shoe.

35:26.122 --> 35:27.830
Oh, my God.

35:27.997 --> 35:30.038
Oh, my God,
you're bean dip girl.

35:30.205 --> 35:32.205
You're bean dip girl?
I am.

35:32.330 --> 35:34.455
Have you been bean dip
girl the whole time?

35:34.622 --> 35:36.788
Oh, he's so good.

35:36.955 --> 35:39.038
I can't believe that.
I was gonna call you.

35:39.205 --> 35:40.538
I had your number on my hand

35:40.705 --> 35:42.580
and I jumped in the pool
and it was gone.

35:42.747 --> 35:45.247
I thought I lost you.
I thought you were gone forever.

35:45.413 --> 35:46.580
And you...

35:46.747 --> 35:48.913
You look so much better
without the fake baby.

35:49.080 --> 35:50.663
I actually prefer the mullet.

35:50.830 --> 35:52.163
Oh, I just cut it yesterday.

35:52.330 --> 35:53.538
Oh.
For work.

35:53.705 --> 35:56.705
Don't think this whole funny,
charming thing right now

35:56.872 --> 35:58.663
gets you off
for stealing my signs.

35:58.830 --> 36:00.955
I don't know
what you're talking about.

36:01.122 --> 36:03.038
I'm furious
those signs are gone.

36:03.205 --> 36:04.663
You're lying.
I'm not lying.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.497
Your voice just went up.
What?

36:07.205 --> 36:08.497
I'm a ...

36:08.663 --> 36:10.996
I'm not lying. I am not lying.

36:11.163 --> 36:12.580
You're so lying.
No, I'm not.

36:12.746 --> 36:14.621
Fucking James Bond. Fuck.

36:15.996 --> 36:19.038
Wow, look at that, huh?

36:19.205 --> 36:22.330
Holy smokes.
Another gorgeous shot.

36:22.496 --> 36:23.663
Yeah, thanks.

36:25.205 --> 36:27.830
What should I use,
pitching wedge or nine?

36:27.955 --> 36:30.080
I used the nine.

36:30.413 --> 36:32.705
I think maybe
I should use the wedge.

36:32.871 --> 36:34.288
Or use the wedge.

36:37.538 --> 36:39.580
Ugh! Why am I like this?

36:39.746 --> 36:42.955
Oh, just pick a club and hit it.
What is the big deal?

36:44.080 --> 36:45.830
Will you do the orgy with me?

36:47.371 --> 36:48.871
Hey, can we play through?

36:49.038 --> 36:50.121
Hold on a second, man.

36:53.621 --> 36:54.830
The orgy

36:54.996 --> 36:57.121
You think that would be
a good idea?

36:58.496 --> 37:00.996
I'm stuck.
And I think the reason

37:01.163 --> 37:03.455
is because
I feel like a fucking fraud.

37:03.621 --> 37:07.038
I'm not cool.
I have a law degree.

37:07.205 --> 37:10.580
I ride a motorcycle and it scares
the fucking shit out of me.

37:10.746 --> 37:13.163
And I play golf at my mom's
fucking country club

37:13.913 --> 37:15.496
with assholes like this.

37:15.663 --> 37:18.330
What's the holdup?
Play the wedge!

37:18.830 --> 37:20.955
This is not rock'n'roll.

37:22.330 --> 37:24.746
This could be
really good for me.

37:24.913 --> 37:26.913
For me and for us.

37:27.580 --> 37:29.788
Will you do the orgy with me?

37:32.621 --> 37:34.746
Sure, yeah, yeah, whatever.
Yeah.

37:35.788 --> 37:37.080
Really?

37:37.996 --> 37:40.330
Holy shit.
Yeah.

37:42.038 --> 37:45.080
If you're sure
this is what you want.

37:45.246 --> 37:47.913
Yeah, absolutely.

37:48.080 --> 37:50.246
Good.
I think.

37:50.413 --> 37:52.496
Fore!

38:00.121 --> 38:02.538
So you wanna know why
guys don't get as excited

38:02.705 --> 38:05.205
about their wedding
as women do?

38:05.371 --> 38:08.871
See, it used to be like a guy would get
rewarded for his commitment with sex.

38:09.038 --> 38:11.705
But you and Glenn have
had sex like a billion times.

38:11.871 --> 38:14.205
For God's sake, you guys
have a kid together.

38:14.371 --> 38:19.913
So for Glenn, it's just kind of
like all commitment, no reward.

38:20.080 --> 38:21.538
You know?

38:22.163 --> 38:24.746
I'm the fucking reward.

38:24.913 --> 38:26.538
Of course you are.
Of course.

38:28.955 --> 38:31.080
Something's wrong.
He's never late.

38:31.246 --> 38:33.246
Try him again.
I have been trying him.

38:33.413 --> 38:34.830
He's not answering his phone.

38:34.996 --> 38:37.580
At least he won't wear a white
tuxedo like you dickheads.

38:38.330 --> 38:40.371
Oh, God, that's good.

38:43.955 --> 38:45.330
Oh, sweet Lord in heaven.

38:45.496 --> 38:47.121
What the fuck, are you stoned?

38:47.288 --> 38:49.496
No. No, no, no, better.

38:49.663 --> 38:52.288
I'm wearing a thing called
The Yank. From Adam & Eve.

38:52.455 --> 38:55.330
One end straps around your leg,
the other end around your Wang.

38:55.496 --> 38:59.455
The brochure says, 'With every stride,
it gives your member a gentle tug.'

38:59.621 --> 39:00.663
Ahh.

39:00.830 --> 39:03.663
What are you doing with a rope
on your cock at my wedding?

39:03.830 --> 39:05.746
Endurance training, Labor Day.

39:05.913 --> 39:08.830
Mm-mm.
For what? A jack-off marathon?

39:09.538 --> 39:11.746
What? Uh, yeah.

39:11.913 --> 39:14.538
That's exactly it.
You nailed it. Heh, heh.

39:14.705 --> 39:16.371
Hey, check it out.
Look who's here.

39:16.538 --> 39:19.330
Oh, fantastic.
Another asshole in white tails.

39:19.496 --> 39:21.788
Keep the change, man.

39:22.913 --> 39:24.621
Ha-ha-ha. Oh, my God.

39:25.996 --> 39:27.455
Well, well, well.
Look at you.

39:27.621 --> 39:31.163
You're late, you're in costume,
and you appear to be hammered.

39:31.330 --> 39:32.496
Who the hell are you?

39:32.663 --> 39:34.788
Long story. I got fired.

39:34.955 --> 39:36.121
What?
What?

39:36.288 --> 39:39.788
It had more to do with the fact that I
almost blew a $2 billion merger deal

39:39.954 --> 39:42.954
because some bozo jumped into
the pool with my blackberry.

39:43.329 --> 39:44.996
Oh, shit. Dude.

39:45.163 --> 39:47.288
I spent most of last night
crying and drinking

39:47.454 --> 39:51.288
and then I drunk-dialed my mom.
She kind of talked me down.

39:51.454 --> 39:53.121
Then I woke up this morning,

39:53.288 --> 39:56.413
had a little more to drink
and I realized, you know what?

39:56.579 --> 39:58.621
This is good. I'm free.

39:58.788 --> 40:00.079
Adam, I'm so sorry.

40:00.246 --> 40:02.163
Shh, shh, shush.
You're my friend.

40:02.329 --> 40:04.246
No, they took my twenties
from me.

40:04.413 --> 40:07.454
And I plan to make my thirties
making up for it.

40:07.621 --> 40:09.246
And you know what else?

40:09.413 --> 40:11.996
I'm doing the orgy. Fuck it.

40:12.538 --> 40:13.579
GLENN Orgy?

40:13.746 --> 40:15.329
What orgy?

40:15.496 --> 40:17.121
The fuck are you talking about?

40:17.288 --> 40:19.996
See, this is exactly why we
should have told him, Eric.

40:20.163 --> 40:21.454
Told me what?

40:21.621 --> 40:23.746
That's what we're doing
for Labor Day. An orgy.

40:23.913 --> 40:26.496
Bullshit. Who's having an orgy?

40:26.663 --> 40:28.954
It's me, Willow,
these two fellas,

40:29.121 --> 40:31.454
Laura, Sue, now drunkie.

40:31.621 --> 40:32.746
Waiting on Alison.

40:32.913 --> 40:34.913
Jesus H.
Fucking Christ.

40:35.038 --> 40:37.913
How come you cocksuckers didn't
think of this fucking orgy idea

40:38.079 --> 40:40.371
five fucking years ago?
God damn it!

40:40.538 --> 40:42.579
Ahem. Uh, Glenn.

40:42.746 --> 40:45.413
I'm afraid we're gonna have
to shirt without your friend.

40:45.579 --> 40:46.829
Oh, he's here.
He's, uh...

40:47.163 --> 40:48.913
Hi, Rabbi.
No.

40:49.538 --> 40:50.913
Pardon my French.

40:55.163 --> 40:56.329
All right, everybody.

40:56.496 --> 40:58.996
Introducing
for the very first time,

40:59.163 --> 41:01.579
Mr. and Mrs. Glenn Pasillio.

41:03.079 --> 41:06.121
Paciello.
Paciellio.

41:12.538 --> 41:13.663
Here we go.

41:13.829 --> 41:14.871
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

41:15.538 --> 41:16.704
I am married.

41:19.329 --> 41:20.329
Thank you.

41:22.163 --> 41:24.996
I can't believe you guys
broke up because you shaved.

41:25.163 --> 41:27.079
He's the weirdest,
creepiest guy ever.

41:27.246 --> 41:28.913
Here you are, ladies.

41:29.079 --> 41:31.496
You guys are definitely
broken up this time, right?

41:34.829 --> 41:36.204
Fuck relationships.

41:36.371 --> 41:40.163
Right now, all I wanna
do is have some fun.

41:41.454 --> 41:45.496
<i>No, I'm not afraid of love?</i>

41:48.579 --> 41:51.663
<i>Just because I run away?</i>

41:52.996 --> 41:55.538
When you say you need me?

41:56.579 --> 41:59.996
<i>I'm not afraid?</i>

42:02.121 --> 42:04.996
<i>I'm not afraid?</i>

42:06.246 --> 42:08.079
Labor Day.

42:08.913 --> 42:09.954
I'm in.

42:10.121 --> 42:11.954
Yes. Yes.

42:12.121 --> 42:13.788
Oh, and I'm fully shaved.

42:15.621 --> 42:17.454
Alison.
Oh, no, no, no.

42:17.621 --> 42:19.621
I'm not making a speech.

42:19.788 --> 42:22.954
Sorry about that.
It's, uh, private conversation.

42:26.163 --> 42:29.621
You know what they're doing over Labor Day?
Do you know what the party is?

42:29.788 --> 42:30.871
What?

42:31.038 --> 42:33.454
They're having a fucking orgy.

42:33.621 --> 42:35.829
Heh-heh-heh.
What are you talking about?

42:35.996 --> 42:38.538
They are having an orgy.

42:39.371 --> 42:40.496
Like a sex orgy?

42:40.663 --> 42:42.746
Like a sex orgy
and we're not invited.

42:46.579 --> 42:47.954
Hey. Hi.

42:48.121 --> 42:49.496
So is it true?

42:49.663 --> 42:51.871
That all of you
are having this orgy

42:52.038 --> 42:53.913
and you didn't think
to invite us?

42:56.079 --> 42:58.954
What are you all
looking at me for? I...

42:59.121 --> 43:01.663
Guys, you just got married,
okay?

43:01.829 --> 43:03.788
L... You have a kid.
You don't...

43:03.954 --> 43:06.246
Don't you think
it's a little inappropriate?

43:06.412 --> 43:08.079
Well, of course
we wouldn't come.

43:08.246 --> 43:11.079
It's that you didn't ask us.
You didn't even think of us.

43:11.246 --> 43:13.662
In fact, you specifically
hid this from us.

43:13.829 --> 43:15.787
We invited all you
to be here today,

43:15.954 --> 43:18.287
just the most special
day of our lives,

43:18.454 --> 43:22.329
and you, who are supposed
to be our closest friends...

43:22.496 --> 43:25.537
There were family members who didn't
get invited so you could come.

43:25.704 --> 43:26.871
Family members.
Right.

43:27.704 --> 43:31.454
Now, we're just totally out of your
pervy little social club. Huh?

43:32.579 --> 43:33.704
I don't believe this.

43:40.204 --> 43:42.371
Sorry.
Are you happy?

43:43.996 --> 43:47.371
Because you and your stupid orgy
just ruined our goddamn wedding.

43:47.537 --> 43:49.579
- Oh, come on, Glenn.
- Kate!

43:49.871 --> 43:52.371
Is it too late to invite them?
I'll go talk to her.

43:52.537 --> 43:53.579
No!

43:53.746 --> 43:55.662
Are you kidding me?
Guys, it's Katie.

43:55.829 --> 43:57.454
She's gonna be fine
in like an hour.

43:57.621 --> 43:59.371
I just realized
I'm really hammered

43:59.537 --> 44:01.621
and I would really
like to dance.

44:01.787 --> 44:03.121
I'm dancing too.

44:03.287 --> 44:06.037
This reminds me
of our senior prom.

44:06.204 --> 44:08.204
You still won't give me
a hand job, right?

44:11.329 --> 44:12.996
<i>It's the boom boom?</i>

44:14.037 --> 44:15.996
<i>It's the boom boom?</i>

44:19.996 --> 44:21.746
<i>Oh, baby?</i>

44:21.912 --> 44:23.162
Oh, God.

44:29.162 --> 44:32.787
It's amazing that you're still
so tight with your high school friends.

44:32.954 --> 44:34.829
None of mine moved
back after college.

44:34.996 --> 44:37.829
Yeah, it's a, uh... I don't know,
it's maybe corny to say,

44:37.996 --> 44:39.871
but these guys and gals
are kind of like

44:40.037 --> 44:42.537
the closest thing I've got
to a family these days.

44:42.704 --> 44:45.829
That's why the house, the summer
house, it's like our rec center.

44:46.329 --> 44:48.621
I think we're getting an offer
on the rec center.

44:49.996 --> 44:51.246
My dad will be thrilled.

44:51.412 --> 44:52.787
I knew it.
What?

44:52.954 --> 44:55.371
I knew it wasn't a family
decision to sell the house.

44:55.537 --> 44:58.829
No. We're not big into
family decisions any more.

44:58.996 --> 45:01.246
My mom,
she lives in Portland, Oregon,

45:01.412 --> 45:04.537
with this, uh,
Reiki healer asshole.

45:04.704 --> 45:07.329
Tell me exactly how you feel.
Oh, he's good. He's good.

45:07.496 --> 45:10.079
Uh, no, she's kind of
out of the picture.

45:10.246 --> 45:12.829
Her doing. Um, yeah,
it's just me and my dad.

45:12.996 --> 45:15.579
Hm, well, your dad
seems like a fun guy.

45:15.746 --> 45:16.787
Oh!
Yeah?

45:16.954 --> 45:18.996
Yeah, yeah, he's very fun.
He's a hoot.

45:19.162 --> 45:21.954
Kind of like being raised
by an older fraternity brother.

45:22.121 --> 45:24.662
He hit on me a little bit.
No.

45:24.829 --> 45:26.954
He ask you to play golf?
Yes.

45:27.121 --> 45:29.412
That's his move.
He's very good at golf. Very good.

45:29.579 --> 45:32.746
But he did it right in front
of Cherie and she had no idea.

45:32.912 --> 45:34.454
Neither did my mom for a while.

45:34.829 --> 45:36.746
Now if you will excuse me, Oh.

45:36.912 --> 45:38.829
I have to win this game
if you don't mind.

45:38.996 --> 45:41.704
Does this make you...?
It's a little distracting.

45:41.871 --> 45:43.829
That's not distracting at all. Oh!
Jesus.

45:43.996 --> 45:46.329
I lied.
It was a little distracting.

45:46.496 --> 45:47.662
Help.

45:50.579 --> 45:53.704
Fred's Beds?
Are you sure this is the right place?

45:54.079 --> 45:57.787
Yeah. What do you think
this is, an underground sex club?

45:58.454 --> 46:00.079
Do you have any
idea where you're going?

46:00.246 --> 46:02.287
He said come in
through the warehouse entrance.

46:02.454 --> 46:03.621
You got rubbers on you?

46:03.787 --> 46:04.829
No.
What?

46:04.996 --> 46:06.954
We are here to observe.
That is all.

46:07.121 --> 46:09.204
It's a sex club.
<i>Semper fi.</i> Always prepared.

46:09.371 --> 46:12.121
You know what I mean?
Doesn't that mean 'always faithful'?

46:12.287 --> 46:14.371
Hey, who took Latin
in seventh grade?

46:14.537 --> 46:17.787
Moi, okay? I brought a pack
with me if you need one.

46:17.954 --> 46:19.787
Give me the signal.
I won't need one.

46:19.954 --> 46:21.996
Alto id?
Yeah.

46:25.621 --> 46:26.662
What do you want?

46:26.829 --> 46:28.996
The password is chandelier.

46:31.662 --> 46:32.704
Who's your connection?

46:32.871 --> 46:35.954
Vic George, friend of my uncle's.
Yeah. He told me to expect you.

46:36.120 --> 46:37.204
Come on in.

46:41.745 --> 46:44.579
So welcome to the Paradise.

46:48.829 --> 46:49.870
What the fuck?

46:50.412 --> 46:51.787
Can I hike your clothes?
No.

46:51.954 --> 46:53.204
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.

46:53.370 --> 46:54.495
Okay, follow me.
Yeah.

46:54.662 --> 46:56.829
- This is Bill.
- Hey, Bill.

46:56.995 --> 46:58.704
That was a panda.

46:58.870 --> 46:59.954
Go easy on that thing.

47:00.120 --> 47:02.162
Didi, Ginger.

47:02.412 --> 47:03.995
Clambake.

47:04.162 --> 47:06.412
Good look at that. That's pretty cool.
Yeah.

47:06.579 --> 47:09.579
This group right here.
They're crazy.

47:09.787 --> 47:11.537
My grandma has that thing.

47:11.704 --> 47:13.287
Another time, probably.

47:13.454 --> 47:15.204
You need anything,
just ask for Fred.

47:15.370 --> 47:17.412
Oh, Fred's Beds?
That's a different Fred.

47:17.579 --> 47:18.620
I'm a dentist.

47:18.787 --> 47:21.912
Vic, he is over there in the
futon section. All right?

47:22.079 --> 47:23.245
Okay.
Have a good time.

47:23.412 --> 47:24.454
Thanks, Dr. Fred.

47:24.620 --> 47:25.745
You guys be good.

47:25.912 --> 47:28.620
Whoa. Should've had
this guy at the wedding.

47:28.954 --> 47:30.287
Love the new <i>Price</i> is Right.

47:33.700 --> 47:35.500
Hey, Mikey Hey

47:35.600 --> 47:36.800
Little McCrudden.

47:37.000 --> 47:37.900
Holy shit, you've grown.
Yeah.

47:38.100 --> 47:40.700
How you doing, baby?
Good, good.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.400
How's your folks?
Good, they're on a cruise

47:44.700 --> 47:46.600
Mom got her pound cake
recipe published.

47:46.700 --> 47:48.800
This is my buddy Eric.
Eric, Vic.

47:49.300 --> 47:50.700
First time at
the Paradise, eh, guys?

47:51.500 --> 47:53.900
Come on, guys, take off
the clothes and get fucking.

47:54.200 --> 47:57.800
No. No fucking. No. Actually, no, no.
We're here more doing research

47:57.900 --> 48:00.100
than anything else.
We're gonna throw an orgy.

48:00.200 --> 48:01.700
We were hoping we can
get a little advice.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.200
Just let me finish up here.

48:03.300 --> 48:05.300
No rush.
Rush if you want.

48:05.500 --> 48:06.300
- Rush a little.
- Oh.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.900
Come on, cowboy.
Time to shine.

48:11.400 --> 48:12.400
Look at me, not her.

48:12.700 --> 48:14.000
Look at me, not her. Look at me.
I'm not gonna look at him.

48:14.500 --> 48:16.200
Do me a favor, count me down.

48:17.500 --> 48:20.200
Five, four, three...

48:20.300 --> 48:22.400
Go back to 10!
Ten, nine, eight...

48:23.800 --> 48:25.500
Oh! Your mom's
a good woman.

48:26.500 --> 48:27.500
Just so you know.

48:32.500 --> 48:34.100
Holy shit, I got a second one.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.600
I'm guessing,
we could really use your expertise.

48:38.600 --> 48:40.600
How do we make sure
that the women are into it?

48:41.200 --> 48:44.300
Don't worry about the women,
worry about you guys.

48:44.700 --> 48:46.600
Okay, so how
do we make it happen?

48:47.100 --> 48:48.600
Just because you have a bunch
of naked people in the room

48:48.700 --> 48:50.800
doesn't mean
you're all going to get it on.

48:51.200 --> 48:53.100
Sometimes a girl just
wants to have a heart-to-heart,

48:53.800 --> 48:55.200
and she ends up
pulling a train.

48:56.400 --> 48:57.400
Uh, pulling a train?
Mm.

48:57.600 --> 49:00.200
Yeah, you know.
A train.

49:06.500 --> 49:07.900
Ha-ha-ha.
That's a choo-choo train. Thank you.

49:08.600 --> 49:09.700
Wow. Yes.
One more thing.

49:09.800 --> 49:12.300
Every wolf pack has a leader.
I take it you're the lead wolf?

49:12.335 --> 49:15.900
Fucking A.
Uh, yeah. I guess so. Yeah. Yeah.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
Well, then it's
all on your shoulders.

49:20.100 --> 49:23.300
If you don't run,
nobody behind you can run.

49:23.800 --> 49:25.900
Oh, that's good.
What does that mean? What do I do?

49:26.400 --> 49:28.100
You have to get naked.

49:29.600 --> 49:34.000
You've goth get naked in your mind,
in your heart, in your soul.

49:34.800 --> 49:37.100
You've goth be honest
with yourself and everybody

49:37.200 --> 49:40.900
about what you want. If you're
a pegger, be honest about that.

49:41.400 --> 49:42.700
What is a pegger?

49:43.300 --> 49:45.100
Chick fucks a dude up the ass
with a strap-on.

49:47.200 --> 49:49.400
Yeah, not really my bag,
but like I always say,

49:49.800 --> 49:51.400
I'm willing to try
anything twice.

49:56.200 --> 49:57.700
Hello, senator. Hello.

49:59.700 --> 50:01.600
This is a lot to process.

50:02.700 --> 50:04.000
You listen to me.

50:04.700 --> 50:07.200
You can't force it
and you can't fake it.

50:08.500 --> 50:13.600
So you better cut the bullshit,
nut up, and be a man.

50:16.300 --> 50:17.500
Now if you'll excuse me,

50:17.600 --> 50:20.100
I feel the blood
rushing back to my sword.

50:20.900 --> 50:22.200
I noticed that.

50:24.300 --> 50:26.500
Well, hey, Vic, thank you.
This is all good stuff.

50:26.800 --> 50:28.200
Good advice.
Yeah. Good. Thank you.

50:28.700 --> 50:30.100
My pleasure, guys.

50:30.700 --> 50:32.400
Okay, watch that thing.
This is unnecessary.

50:33.200 --> 50:34.300
Good luck.

50:35.300 --> 50:37.700
Okay. Good, we need to go now.

50:38.800 --> 50:40.030
Don't eat anything here.

50:40.400 --> 50:41.500
You son of a bitch.
Don't.

50:47.800 --> 50:49.200
Holy shit, is that...?
Oh, boy.

50:49.400 --> 50:50.500
Keep going. Don't let her see you.

50:52.578 --> 50:55.412
- Oh. Man, oh, man. All right.
- That was good?

50:55.578 --> 50:56.870
That was good.
Yeah.

50:57.037 --> 50:58.162
Yeah, okay, here we go.

50:59.328 --> 51:01.203
You ready?
Showtime.

51:02.662 --> 51:04.703
Sh... Shit.

51:04.870 --> 51:06.162
I'm gonna count that.
Okay.

51:06.328 --> 51:07.995
I'm gonna count that there.
Okay.

51:08.162 --> 51:10.870
Yeah, it's juvenile.
I've been meaning to ask you something.

51:11.037 --> 51:13.537
What?
What's Dody like as a boss?

51:13.703 --> 51:17.328
She just seems like she could be
a little, you know, domineering.

51:17.495 --> 51:21.245
Oh, my gosh, no. I mean, she's
not what you think, you know.

51:21.412 --> 51:23.703
I mean, of course,
at work she's all business,

51:23.870 --> 51:26.162
but, Eric, she has
traveled the world.

51:26.328 --> 51:28.578
No shit.
She speaks all these languages.

51:28.745 --> 51:31.203
Wow.
She's just full of surprises.

51:31.370 --> 51:32.912
Oh, I bet she is.

51:33.078 --> 51:35.162
I bet she's been places
I can only imagine.

51:35.495 --> 51:38.328
So, like, now that
you're super into me...

51:39.995 --> 51:42.745
No, there's something
I actually have to tell you.

51:42.912 --> 51:44.370
Sincerely I, um...
Really?

51:44.537 --> 51:46.495
Yeah, I kind of misled you.
Uh...

51:46.662 --> 51:51.537
What you saw today was not an actual
representation of my Frisbee golf skills.

51:51.703 --> 51:53.828
Yeah. I let you win.

51:53.995 --> 51:55.662
Really? Yeah.

51:55.828 --> 51:57.828
So I want a rematch.
Like, big time.

51:58.703 --> 52:01.162
Or you could just stick
to sucking at pool.

52:01.828 --> 52:03.328
Ooh.

52:03.495 --> 52:05.662
Sss!
Oh.

52:10.870 --> 52:12.120
One more.

52:12.287 --> 52:13.495
That's it, though.
No.

52:13.662 --> 52:15.745
That was the last one.
That's for the road.

52:15.870 --> 52:16.953
I will call you.

52:17.328 --> 52:19.245
Okay.
All right.

52:22.620 --> 52:24.953
What are you doing
for Labor Day?

52:25.995 --> 52:28.412
Oh, yeah. Is that...?
Yeah, Labor Day.

52:28.578 --> 52:30.370
Um, you know what?

52:30.537 --> 52:33.245
The guys and the crew,
we're all gonna, um...

52:33.412 --> 52:35.287
We're doing
this small little thing,

52:35.453 --> 52:37.953
this intimate little thing.
Nothing... Nothing special.

52:38.120 --> 52:40.620
Well, I was thinking
that maybe, you know,

52:40.787 --> 52:43.453
your friends and my friends
could get together.

52:43.620 --> 52:44.870
Yeah.

52:45.037 --> 52:46.453
Oh, that sounds great.
Yeah?

52:46.620 --> 52:48.537
We should definitely
look into that maybe.

52:48.703 --> 52:50.120
Yeah. It'd be fun.

52:50.287 --> 52:53.037
So, wait, Eric, is that...?
Is that a maybe?

52:53.203 --> 52:56.287
Yeah, it's a maybe. It's a definite maybe.
It's a hard, hard maybe.

52:56.453 --> 52:58.495
We should definitely
think about doing that.

52:58.662 --> 53:00.912
Let's lock it in as a possibility.

53:01.078 --> 53:02.287
Okay.
Okay.

53:02.453 --> 53:04.703
I'll call you about it.

53:04.870 --> 53:05.995
Or write you.

53:06.162 --> 53:07.953
Heh, okay.

53:08.120 --> 53:10.412
Carrier pigeon. Something.
I'll get a hold of you.

53:10.578 --> 53:12.287
Good night, Eric.
Good night, Kelly.

53:31.287 --> 53:33.495
What are you doing up?
Oh, I never went down.

53:33.662 --> 53:37.120
Stayed up drinking with a dude from Blues
Traveler in the Talkhouse parking lot.

53:37.287 --> 53:41.453
Like an hour ago, fucking dude
says the bubonic plague is back.

53:41.620 --> 53:43.870
Great. Another thing
to worry about.

53:45.453 --> 53:47.037
What are you doing up?

53:47.412 --> 53:49.912
I got a bit of a situation.

53:50.078 --> 53:51.870
Hit me.

53:52.037 --> 53:55.703
Okay, but first off,
you can't tell anyone.

53:55.870 --> 53:57.662
Dude, look who you're talking to.

53:57.828 --> 53:59.578
It's the vault.
Seriously.

53:59.745 --> 54:02.120
A lot of people tell people
you can't tell someone,

54:02.287 --> 54:05.203
and those people go and tell someone.
That cannot happen.

54:05.370 --> 54:07.703
Hey. You tell no one.

54:07.870 --> 54:09.536
Not even Rodrigo?

54:09.703 --> 54:13.036
Why would you tell a 50-year-old
Guatemalan landscaper about my life?

54:13.203 --> 54:15.745
Because he's a good
sounding board, okay?

54:15.911 --> 54:19.078
But if you're gonna get all weird
about it, I won't tell Rodrigo.

54:19.245 --> 54:21.245
I appreciate it.

54:22.161 --> 54:24.078
I went on a date last night.

54:24.245 --> 54:25.495
So far, so good.

54:25.661 --> 54:26.703
With the Realtor chick.

54:27.703 --> 54:29.203
Dody Henderson?
Did she peg you?

54:29.370 --> 54:32.161
No, not Dody.
I went out with Kelly.

54:32.328 --> 54:33.495
Oh, thank the Lord.

54:33.661 --> 54:35.661
I felt bad for your
butt hole for a minute.

54:35.828 --> 54:36.870
Heh, heh.
Yeah.

54:37.036 --> 54:41.245
Yeah, and I think
we've got a problem because

54:42.161 --> 54:43.828
I really kind of dig her now.

54:45.495 --> 54:47.828
I don't know what to do
about the orgy situation.

54:47.995 --> 54:49.370
Are you fucking with me?

54:49.536 --> 54:51.661
I know.
What are the odds?

54:51.828 --> 54:53.578
I mean, seriously,
I'm smack dab

54:53.745 --> 54:55.411
in the middle
of organizing an orgy.

54:55.578 --> 54:56.911
Orgy, yeah.
Yes. Yeah.

54:57.078 --> 54:59.495
And I meet the first girl
in a long time

54:59.661 --> 55:02.203
that I can see myself
having a relationship with.

55:02.453 --> 55:05.036
Hmm.
I goth tell her about the orgy.

55:05.203 --> 55:07.120
What? Ha-ha-ha!

55:07.286 --> 55:09.620
No. No. It's so stupid.

55:09.786 --> 55:12.036
No. Listen to me. No, no.

55:12.203 --> 55:15.703
You don't ever, ever, ever
tell her about our little soiree here.

55:15.870 --> 55:17.286
Ever.

55:17.453 --> 55:18.953
Have you perked her yet?

55:19.120 --> 55:21.453
Oh, goddamn it, Mike.
I hate when you say stuff.

55:21.620 --> 55:23.661
No. No, we've kissed.

55:23.828 --> 55:25.536
Kissed, good. Okay, good.

55:25.703 --> 55:28.120
Keep it PG until
after Labor Day, okay?

55:28.286 --> 55:31.661
As long as you haven't had the exclusivity
talk, and you're not boning...

55:31.828 --> 55:33.620
Yeah, I know.
Then you, my friend,

55:33.786 --> 55:34.953
are a free agent.

55:35.120 --> 55:37.078
Mm, I don't know, dude.

55:37.245 --> 55:41.286
Listen to me.
You do not know what or who

55:41.453 --> 55:43.328
she's been doing
in her free time, ace.

55:43.495 --> 55:46.661
So just keep it in your pants
until <i>aprés</i> Labor Day

55:46.828 --> 55:48.453
and then
it'll just be this crazy,

55:48.620 --> 55:51.745
wet, vivid, erotic

55:51.911 --> 55:55.245
sexual misadventure
in your past

55:55.411 --> 55:58.245
that you never have to
tell her about.

56:02.578 --> 56:03.620
Okay...

56:03.786 --> 56:05.745
Okay?
All right, that's the plan.

56:05.911 --> 56:08.995
Thank you.
That was oddly helpful.

56:09.161 --> 56:12.078
I am not just a pretty face.

56:13.453 --> 56:14.828
Oof, ma goof.

56:14.995 --> 56:17.036
Daddy really needs
to get in shape.

56:17.203 --> 56:19.245
Oh, I'm with you.
I may even cut out curbs,

56:19.411 --> 56:21.828
except for pizza
and sandwiches, obviously.

56:22.536 --> 56:26.370
Are you guys worried at all about
performing in front of everyone else?

56:27.078 --> 56:29.078
Look, it's not a race.

56:29.245 --> 56:31.286
Well, assuming
that we can all get wood,

56:31.453 --> 56:33.203
one of us will have
the smallest dick.

56:33.370 --> 56:36.245
And I, for one, do not wanna
have the smallest dick.

56:36.411 --> 56:37.453
Okay. Two things.

56:37.620 --> 56:41.203
The ladies are gonna be too concerned
about their bodies to think about yours.

56:41.370 --> 56:43.703
And secondly, that's all myth.

56:44.620 --> 56:46.370
Women do not care
about penis size.

56:46.536 --> 56:48.953
Who do you think
has the biggest dick?

56:49.120 --> 56:50.203
I think I know.

56:50.995 --> 56:54.036
Boom. Ah!
You're next, Uncle Addie.

56:54.203 --> 56:55.995
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

56:56.161 --> 56:58.911
No one fucking said anything
about giving any fucking blood.

56:59.078 --> 57:00.370
Oops.
And can someone explain

57:00.536 --> 57:04.536
why they need to puncture your vein to find
out if there's a problem with your shvantz?

57:04.703 --> 57:06.953
Summer after freshman year,

57:07.120 --> 57:11.036
Yeah?
I walked in on one of the guys

57:11.203 --> 57:13.120
whacking off.

57:13.286 --> 57:15.411
Shut up. Who?
I won't say.

57:15.578 --> 57:16.953
No, no, no, who?
Who? Who?

57:17.120 --> 57:22.703
I'm not gonna tell you, but I
will say that it was a monster.

57:22.870 --> 57:25.536
Hey. That is my blood.

57:25.703 --> 57:27.161
That used to be inside you.

57:27.328 --> 57:28.411
I'm gonna lie down.

57:28.578 --> 57:30.203
What?
Duquez, Duquez!

57:30.370 --> 57:32.328
You goth give us ballpark...
Right, right.

57:32.494 --> 57:33.494
Like is that...?

57:33.661 --> 57:35.869
It's more like...
It was like that.

57:36.036 --> 57:37.411
What?
But the head.

57:37.578 --> 57:39.119
What?
It's even bigger.

57:39.286 --> 57:40.494
Mama likes.

57:40.661 --> 57:42.494
I don't know
if you're gonna like it.

57:44.619 --> 57:46.953
Oh, hi.

57:47.119 --> 57:48.328
Eric?

57:48.494 --> 57:50.744
Kelly. Uh, we're just
heading back to the city.

57:50.911 --> 57:52.703
We'll be in touch this week.
Good.

57:52.869 --> 57:53.911
Regarding the house.

57:54.078 --> 57:56.953
Of course, the house, yes.
Yeah, I'll page you.

57:59.453 --> 58:01.828
Dody.
Eric.

58:01.994 --> 58:03.869
The password this week
is unicorn.

58:05.036 --> 58:07.078
Well, I don't know
if that'll be nece...

58:18.286 --> 58:20.494
<i>Moving up and down
Like an elevator?</i>

58:23.078 --> 58:25.536
We're here to share
<i>our</i> experiences

58:25.703 --> 58:29.453
<i>in creating the perfect orgy
of your personal fantasies.</i>

58:34.536 --> 58:36.994
See that?
Everybody's always touching two people.

58:37.161 --> 58:38.911
A little teamwork.

58:39.078 --> 58:40.619
They're playing good team ball.

58:40.786 --> 58:43.078
Okay, I think we get the picture.

58:50.161 --> 58:51.869
McCrudds, you want some pizza?

58:52.036 --> 58:53.661
No, I'm not hungry.
Thank you.

58:53.828 --> 58:55.911
Got an all-I-can-eat buffet
going right here.

58:57.119 --> 58:58.994
Let me try.
Try this.

58:59.578 --> 59:00.911
What is that?

59:03.828 --> 59:05.578
- Oh!
- Shit!

59:05.744 --> 59:08.078
Oh, he's doing my move.
Look at that.

59:08.244 --> 59:10.244
He knows the Thoosh.

59:13.161 --> 59:14.411
Hey, you guys? Guys.

59:14.578 --> 59:18.869
Back to the music. Are we...?
Are we really gonna listen to Indian the whole night?

59:19.036 --> 59:21.744
I think it might get a little...
Cab ride-y? Agreed. Yeah.

59:21.911 --> 59:24.203
I'm working on
a killer playlist right now.

59:24.369 --> 59:26.036
Got some obscure Radiohead.

59:26.203 --> 59:28.244
Who has sex to Radiohead?

59:28.411 --> 59:30.244
Thom Yorke.

59:30.411 --> 59:31.786
No Radiohead.
No Radiohead.

59:31.953 --> 59:35.078
I think we need something
sensual, like Sting.

59:35.244 --> 59:36.619
- I love Sting.
- No.

59:36.786 --> 59:39.036
Unacceptable.
Absolutely not fucking Sting.

59:39.203 --> 59:41.869
That's bullshit, man.
If Sting comes on the fucking stereo,

59:42.036 --> 59:43.494
guess who's walking.
This guy.

59:43.661 --> 59:45.703
Sting, it is then.

59:47.911 --> 59:50.453
Yeah?
Sol

59:50.619 --> 59:51.911
got you a little present.

59:52.078 --> 59:53.119
Really?
Mm-hm.

59:53.494 --> 59:56.119
It's filled with some great things
for next weekend.

59:56.286 --> 59:58.369
It's not my birthday. Oh.

59:59.869 --> 01:00:03.411
Look, oh, boy. Oh, wow. Look at that guy.
He's like a Swiss Army dude.

01:00:03.578 --> 01:00:05.828
Wow, that's great.
People are gonna love that.

01:00:05.994 --> 01:00:08.453
Just so you know...
Mm-hm?

01:00:08.619 --> 01:00:10.536
I'm not wearing
any underwear right now.

01:00:10.703 --> 01:00:12.078
Ew, on these stools?

01:00:12.244 --> 01:00:13.994
Well, well, well,
the gang's all here.

01:00:14.161 --> 01:00:15.869
Paciellio!

01:00:16.036 --> 01:00:17.536
Hi.
Paciellio.

01:00:18.953 --> 01:00:20.744
Hi, guys.
What's up?

01:00:20.911 --> 01:00:22.703
We have some business
to discuss.

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:28.494
Right. So Glenn and I
have talked it over and...

01:00:29.661 --> 01:00:32.078
we would like to be
included in the orgy.

01:00:33.661 --> 01:00:35.619
We're in.

01:00:35.786 --> 01:00:36.869
We wanna do it.

01:00:39.953 --> 01:00:41.869
Um...

01:00:43.619 --> 01:00:44.661
No.

01:00:44.828 --> 01:00:45.953
Why not? What...
What?

01:00:46.119 --> 01:00:47.953
We already lined up
my folks to babysit.

01:00:48.453 --> 01:00:51.911
Guys, guys, as a friend
and a menial-health professional,

01:00:52.078 --> 01:00:53.869
I think it is a horrible idea.

01:00:54.036 --> 01:00:56.119
If you feel disconnected,
I understand...

01:00:56.286 --> 01:00:58.953
Alison, with all due respect,

01:00:59.119 --> 01:01:01.452
you're an MA, I'm an MD.

01:01:01.827 --> 01:01:03.327
You're a podiatrist.

01:01:03.494 --> 01:01:05.161
Okay, let's hike a vote.

01:01:05.327 --> 01:01:07.577
How many people want us in?
Right.

01:01:07.744 --> 01:01:10.869
I would just like to say that I
think they maybe have a point here.

01:01:11.036 --> 01:01:14.327
Just because they have a baby doesn't
mean we should discriminate.

01:01:14.494 --> 01:01:17.661
Plus, Kate's rack
is killer right now.

01:01:17.827 --> 01:01:19.411
Thank you, Michael.
Yeah.

01:01:19.577 --> 01:01:23.077
Jesus, Mike, are you insane?
No. No, no.

01:01:23.244 --> 01:01:26.119
Dude, dude, dude, 10 o'clock.
Ten o'clock. My 10, my 10.

01:01:27.411 --> 01:01:28.744
Shit.

01:01:28.911 --> 01:01:31.577
Hey! Look who it is.

01:01:31.744 --> 01:01:33.244
Hi, there it is.

01:01:33.411 --> 01:01:35.286
Hey, uh, this is my Realtor,
Kelly.

01:01:35.452 --> 01:01:37.161
This is the group, the gang.

01:01:37.327 --> 01:01:38.952
Hi, Kelly.
Hi, Kelly.

01:01:39.119 --> 01:01:41.494
Gosh, I've heard so much
about all of you guys.

01:01:41.661 --> 01:01:43.161
How? When?

01:01:43.327 --> 01:01:45.911
What? Why? What's she hiking about?
Let's get a drink.

01:01:46.077 --> 01:01:47.702
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:48.827 --> 01:01:51.619
You think we couldn't handle
this because we're parents?

01:01:51.786 --> 01:01:54.786
Well, we can handle shit
that you can't even imagine.

01:01:54.952 --> 01:01:57.536
You know, you motherfuckers
have no idea.

01:01:57.702 --> 01:01:59.036
- That's right.
- No idea.

01:01:59.202 --> 01:02:01.369
Come on.
You... You...

01:02:01.536 --> 01:02:03.536
You're ll lightweights

01:02:03.702 --> 01:02:06.494
You are all playing JV ball.

01:02:06.661 --> 01:02:07.702
Lightweights.
Whoa.

01:02:07.869 --> 01:02:09.744
- All right, Glenn.
- Come on, honey.

01:02:10.786 --> 01:02:14.077
On a lighter note,
I have this present.

01:02:16.536 --> 01:02:17.702
Dildos.

01:02:17.869 --> 01:02:20.786
You know, in a pinch, this would
be great for a toothbrush.

01:02:23.702 --> 01:02:25.244
And I have no idea
what this is.

01:02:25.411 --> 01:02:27.702
Hey, Eric, what's up
with all the dildos?

01:02:27.869 --> 01:02:30.869
Hey, those are my friends.
Hey, what's going on with the house?

01:02:31.036 --> 01:02:35.786
Um, I've been able to slow things down
to buy you till the end of the summer.

01:02:36.369 --> 01:02:37.911
Really? Yeah.

01:02:38.661 --> 01:02:40.661
Oh, you're the best.

01:02:42.994 --> 01:02:44.327
Thank you so much.

01:02:44.494 --> 01:02:46.036
What is that?
What?

01:02:46.202 --> 01:02:47.744
What's going on?
Nothing.

01:02:47.911 --> 01:02:49.661
He told me not to tell
anybody so...

01:02:49.827 --> 01:02:51.161
Yeah, okay.
You know.

01:02:52.327 --> 01:02:53.911
Keep it on the down-low.
Yeah.

01:02:54.077 --> 01:02:55.869
He asked her out
to get them to shill.

01:02:56.036 --> 01:02:57.619
Went on a couple dates,
likes her,

01:02:57.786 --> 01:03:01.286
doesn't want to sleep with her before
the orgy because it's wrong to do both.

01:03:01.452 --> 01:03:03.327
Oh. He doesn't wanna
sleep with her.

01:03:03.494 --> 01:03:05.661
That actually means
he likes her.

01:03:05.827 --> 01:03:06.827
- Oh.
- Awesome.

01:03:06.994 --> 01:03:08.661
Hey. Dildo wave.

01:03:08.827 --> 01:03:10.827
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:03:13.661 --> 01:03:16.327
Hey...

01:03:28.952 --> 01:03:30.494
Phewl

01:03:30.661 --> 01:03:33.244
Yo, maharajah,
wanna get my back for me?

01:03:33.411 --> 01:03:35.536
What is this shit?
Self tanner, man.

01:03:35.702 --> 01:03:37.536
I wanna look like a porn star.

01:03:37.702 --> 01:03:40.036
Fuck me, I just stroked out
my third batch <i>du jour.</i>

01:03:40.202 --> 01:03:43.952
You boys might wanna do the same.
Don't wanna come quick like a bunch of amateurs.

01:03:44.119 --> 01:03:46.952
Oh, God.
I am not touching you.

01:03:47.911 --> 01:03:49.952
Ah, fuck it.
I'm gonna whack it again.

01:03:50.119 --> 01:03:52.869
You look so pretty.
So do you.

01:03:53.036 --> 01:03:54.077
Thank you.

01:03:54.244 --> 01:03:55.619
I love it.

01:03:55.786 --> 01:03:57.369
Consider yourself warned.

01:03:57.536 --> 01:04:00.911
This absinthe is the real deal.
I had it flown in from Amsterdam.

01:04:01.077 --> 01:04:05.244
The guy that sold it to me said it's the stuff
Van Gogh was on when he cut his ear off.

01:04:05.411 --> 01:04:06.577
- Oh, no.
Uh-oh.

01:04:06.744 --> 01:04:08.494
It's gonna be
a starry night, huh?

01:04:08.661 --> 01:04:09.786
It smells like licorice.

01:04:09.952 --> 01:04:12.286
A toast. A toast.

01:04:12.452 --> 01:04:13.952
- To friends.
- Ohh.

01:04:14.119 --> 01:04:15.494
- To friends.
- Ohh.

01:04:15.661 --> 01:04:19.744
And to making sweet love
with, to, near...

01:04:19.911 --> 01:04:21.161
On.
In.

01:04:21.327 --> 01:04:23.411
Under. And behind.

01:04:25.744 --> 01:04:27.494
All rig ht, salad'.
I 'chain?!

01:04:30.827 --> 01:04:32.410
Hagalaka.

01:04:32.577 --> 01:04:34.577
Whoo! Sober. Never more

01:04:42.910 --> 01:04:44.577
The pillows look really nice.

01:04:44.744 --> 01:04:46.035
Yeah.

01:04:46.202 --> 01:04:48.119
These Crate and Barrel or...?

01:04:56.702 --> 01:04:57.744
You guys look great.

01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:59.035
Oh, thanks.

01:04:59.202 --> 01:05:00.535
You look so fucking hot.

01:05:00.702 --> 01:05:03.535
I'm just being honest.
I wanna lick your belly button.

01:05:03.702 --> 01:05:06.744
And yours, your belly button's nice too.
You got a good one too.

01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:10.035
I haven't seen yours, but I'm gonna
lick the shit out of that thing.

01:05:10.202 --> 01:05:11.535
Wow.

01:05:11.702 --> 01:05:14.535
As the de facto lead wolf,
right?

01:05:14.702 --> 01:05:17.452
I, uh...
I should kick this mofo off,

01:05:17.619 --> 01:05:20.744
but I goth be honest with you.
I have no idea what to do, so...

01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:22.369
Lead wolf?
Oh, yeah.

01:05:22.535 --> 01:05:25.702
You had to be there kind of.
Tut-tut-tut. Okay.

01:05:25.869 --> 01:05:28.327
Listen up, everybody.
As per usual,

01:05:28.494 --> 01:05:31.369
it is up to me
to get this party started.

01:05:31.535 --> 01:05:34.827
Hang on. I got something for you.
Hang on a second, ladies.

01:05:39.994 --> 01:05:42.452
Yeah, rock 'n' roll.
Holy moly.

01:05:42.619 --> 01:05:43.660
We're on safari now.

01:05:43.827 --> 01:05:44.910
Yeah.

01:05:45.077 --> 01:05:46.535
How many leopards had to die?

01:05:46.702 --> 01:05:48.827
Just one big old kinky leopard.

01:05:50.202 --> 01:05:51.577
They won't kick us out.

01:05:51.744 --> 01:05:53.577
If we're here,
they won't kick us out.

01:05:53.744 --> 01:05:56.119
Okay.
They won't do it.

01:05:56.285 --> 01:05:59.285
And we're totally sure
we wanna do this?

01:06:02.869 --> 01:06:06.077
Somebody do something. Huh?

01:06:06.244 --> 01:06:08.952
All right? Anybody?

01:06:09.785 --> 01:06:14.119
All right, fuck it. I'm gonna call it.
Sue, kiss Alison. I'm gonna shirt touching myself.

01:06:14.285 --> 01:06:17.952
Oh. We could shirt with a
back-rub circle like in college.

01:06:20.702 --> 01:06:22.869
I'll get things started.

01:06:23.035 --> 01:06:24.452
Yes. Yeah!

01:06:24.619 --> 01:06:26.660
Here we go.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:06:27.494 --> 01:06:30.494
I'm sorry, I can't.
I can't do this any more.

01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:32.285
I can't.
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

01:06:34.785 --> 01:06:35.785
I knew it.

01:06:35.952 --> 01:06:38.119
I knew you'd fucking
puss out, man.

01:06:38.285 --> 01:06:40.535
I'm not pussing out.
I'm in a relationship

01:06:40.702 --> 01:06:43.535
that I really appreciate.
And I don't wanna fuck this up.

01:06:43.702 --> 01:06:46.452
Classic Duquez. You know,
it's like doughnuts, no doughnuts,

01:06:46.619 --> 01:06:48.452
hat, no hat, orgy, no orgy.

01:06:48.619 --> 01:06:50.410
We hike a look-see
through the window

01:06:50.577 --> 01:06:53.077
and if it looks, like,
too freaky or lame,

01:06:53.244 --> 01:06:54.785
Yeah.
We hike off.

01:06:54.952 --> 01:06:59.035
And if it looks,
you know, cool, we go in.

01:06:59.202 --> 01:07:00.827
Okay? okay...

01:07:00.994 --> 01:07:02.410
I'm not mad at you.

01:07:02.577 --> 01:07:04.910
Eric, Eric. I love
what's going on here,

01:07:05.077 --> 01:07:07.160
but I don't think
you need to insult.

01:07:07.327 --> 01:07:09.910
You should actually communicate.
My God, Alison, please.

01:07:10.077 --> 01:07:13.577
Give it a rest? Just one night?
You're uncomfortable with emotion.

01:07:13.744 --> 01:07:16.244
Oh, yeah, I can't. I'm the
only one here with issues.

01:07:16.410 --> 01:07:19.077
It's just me? What about you
and your relationship?

01:07:19.244 --> 01:07:20.410
We broke up.
You broke up?

01:07:20.577 --> 01:07:21.577
Yes.
You broke up?

01:07:21.744 --> 01:07:25.077
Like you broke up a couple years ago
at the Oktoberfest in July party?

01:07:25.244 --> 01:07:27.327
That kind?
What happened on Oktoberfest?

01:07:27.494 --> 01:07:30.744
This one tells me that her and
Marcus are broken up. Over.

01:07:30.910 --> 01:07:33.910
We're joking, having drinks,
she tells me about it, we hook up.

01:07:34.077 --> 01:07:36.619
Next morning, she's having
brunch with the guy.

01:07:36.785 --> 01:07:39.077
Whoa, whoa, wait? What?

01:07:39.244 --> 01:07:40.535
You never told me this.

01:07:40.702 --> 01:07:44.452
Sue, I don't need to tell you because nothing happened.
We didn't sleep together.

01:07:44.619 --> 01:07:46.952
You told me it was a blowjob,
she wouldn't swallow.

01:07:47.119 --> 01:07:49.244
No, I did not, Mike.
I did not say that.

01:07:49.410 --> 01:07:51.869
It was a fucking hand job.
Hand job. That's right.

01:07:52.035 --> 01:07:54.119
It was a hand job.
I'm sorry. My bad.

01:07:54.285 --> 01:07:56.452
- Please don't go there.
- No, no, no.

01:07:56.619 --> 01:07:59.952
Alison, shut up.
You're a hypocrite.

01:08:00.118 --> 01:08:01.368
What's going on?

01:08:01.535 --> 01:08:05.868
First of all, they're dressed
like Indians from India.

01:08:06.035 --> 01:08:07.952
That makes much more sense.
Yeah.

01:08:08.118 --> 01:08:10.868
This is why I don't tell you.
You could've given him a blowjob.

01:08:11.035 --> 01:08:13.368
Why didn't you fuck him?
Why don't you get over it?

01:08:13.535 --> 01:08:16.327
How long are you gonna be
obsessed with Eric?

01:08:17.327 --> 01:08:18.368
Oh, shit.

01:08:19.410 --> 01:08:20.910
Wait, what?

01:08:22.368 --> 01:08:24.327
Okay. okay...

01:08:24.493 --> 01:08:26.660
Urch' your brakes on, people.

01:08:26.827 --> 01:08:29.368
We are rapidly losing
the erotic vibe.

01:08:29.993 --> 01:08:33.493
I'm gonna get this party rocking
right here in a major way.

01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:35.202
What you got, man?

01:08:35.368 --> 01:08:37.743
Ready, set, here we go.

01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:40.160
Oh! Let loose
the Kraken.

01:08:40.327 --> 01:08:42.202
Yeah!

01:08:42.368 --> 01:08:45.327
Will you give it a break, Mike?
This shit's pathetic.

01:08:45.493 --> 01:08:48.077
Oh, fuck you. You fucking pussy.
You're lame.

01:08:48.243 --> 01:08:49.660
You're the lame one, man.

01:08:49.827 --> 01:08:53.160
You don't have a job. You don't have a girlfriend.
You follow Eric around

01:08:53.327 --> 01:08:56.618
and do everything he tells you to do.
You're like his little fucking pet.

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:00.952
Dougie.

01:09:01.118 --> 01:09:02.160
Fuck you, Doug.

01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:10.827
Is that what you think of me? You think that I'm his...?
You think I'm his fucking pet?

01:09:10.993 --> 01:09:12.660
No.

01:09:13.410 --> 01:09:16.868
He meant pet in a nice way.

01:09:19.618 --> 01:09:21.618
Is he fucking with me right now?

01:09:22.077 --> 01:09:24.993
This is the worst orgy ever.

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:27.160
Should we just go home or...?

01:09:27.327 --> 01:09:28.785
No.

01:09:28.952 --> 01:09:31.160
We already got a sitter.

01:09:31.327 --> 01:09:33.827
You wanna go see a movie
or you wanna...?

01:09:37.577 --> 01:09:39.160
Okay, okay.
All right, time out.

01:09:39.327 --> 01:09:41.452
Time out.
Time out, T.O., okay?

01:09:41.618 --> 01:09:44.827
I think everyone just needs
to take a deep breath.

01:09:44.993 --> 01:09:46.243
All right?

01:09:47.285 --> 01:09:50.702
We need to relax and chill out
for a second, all right?

01:09:50.868 --> 01:09:52.368
Whoa!

01:09:52.535 --> 01:09:53.827
Where are you going?
Ah.

01:09:53.993 --> 01:09:56.077
I'm just going outside
to get some fresh air.

01:09:56.243 --> 01:09:57.743
Clear my head.

01:10:00.910 --> 01:10:03.410
I swear to God, guys,
I thought this was gonna be fun.

01:10:27.035 --> 01:10:29.535
Oh, yeah. Oh!

01:10:29.702 --> 01:10:32.368
Why won't God
just let me have an orgy?

01:10:39.952 --> 01:10:43.202
Okay.
All right, here we go.

01:10:46.327 --> 01:10:48.660
Eric.
Kelly, heh, heh.

01:10:48.827 --> 01:10:51.368
What are you doing?
I thought you were with your friends.

01:10:51.535 --> 01:10:52.702
I know. I know. Uh...

01:10:52.868 --> 01:10:54.410
Did you fly here on a carpet?

01:10:54.577 --> 01:10:56.785
No, heh. No, no. I, uh...

01:10:56.952 --> 01:10:59.868
It's a last-second
costume concept for, uh...

01:10:59.993 --> 01:11:04.160
Look, I, uh... I've been thinking about
things and I realized something.

01:11:04.952 --> 01:11:06.035
Oh, shit.

01:11:06.202 --> 01:11:08.785
I thought we ordered pizza.
What'd you get, Indian food?

01:11:11.452 --> 01:11:12.493
I'm sorry.

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:15.535
I, uh... Sorry to interrupt.
Sorry.

01:11:15.702 --> 01:11:18.452
Uh, Pete, give us a second?
Hey, hey, hey, Eric.

01:11:18.618 --> 01:11:20.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

01:11:20.327 --> 01:11:21.410
You didn't call.
I know.

01:11:21.577 --> 01:11:24.243
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:27.118
Oh, pizza? Really?

01:11:27.285 --> 01:11:29.201
I'm sorry.
No, that's all right.

01:11:29.368 --> 01:11:31.160
Hey, what's up, man?
Eighteen bucks.

01:11:31.326 --> 01:11:32.826
Go, have fun. Hone...

01:11:32.993 --> 01:11:35.160
Honestly. No biggie.

01:11:35.326 --> 01:11:36.660
I'll call you tomorrow.

01:11:38.451 --> 01:11:39.868
Bye.

01:11:41.743 --> 01:11:45.660
Like I don't know
that I don't have a girlfriend.

01:11:45.826 --> 01:11:51.201
Like I'm not trying to remember that
every fucking night of my life.

01:11:51.368 --> 01:11:53.576
It's hard.

01:12:00.285 --> 01:12:03.285
So where were we?
Where'd you go?

01:12:03.451 --> 01:12:05.535
I know, I know, I know,
I, uh... Heh.

01:12:05.701 --> 01:12:08.451
I'm sorry I left. You know, I...

01:12:08.618 --> 01:12:12.993
I'm gonna be honest with you, guys.
Um, I'm freaking out a little.

01:12:15.951 --> 01:12:18.618
I have had the best times
of my life

01:12:18.785 --> 01:12:20.951
with you guys in this house

01:12:21.118 --> 01:12:25.743
and I'm gonna miss it.

01:12:26.118 --> 01:12:28.743
I'm gonna miss it so much.

01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:31.285
I love you GUYS...

01:12:34.868 --> 01:12:36.243
She wasn't home, huh?

01:12:36.910 --> 01:12:39.743
No. No, She was home.

01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:41.076
She was on a date.

01:12:42.826 --> 01:12:46.201
Yeah. And I showed up
dressed like fucking Aladdin.

01:12:48.201 --> 01:12:50.576
Well, I think that
you look adorable.

01:12:50.743 --> 01:12:55.076
And I am so happy
that you're back.

01:12:55.243 --> 01:12:58.826
It's been a pretty
emotional night for all of us.

01:12:58.993 --> 01:13:02.326
How about a big
super-gay group hug?

01:13:02.493 --> 01:13:04.535
- Oh, yeah.
- Group hug.

01:13:04.701 --> 01:13:05.701
Yeah.

01:13:05.868 --> 01:13:08.201
Oh! I love you guys.

01:13:08.368 --> 01:13:10.535
Aw!

01:13:13.076 --> 01:13:14.285
Oh, my God.

01:13:14.451 --> 01:13:16.535
Wow.

01:13:16.701 --> 01:13:19.993
Oh, my... I would not
have called that.

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:25.743
Hey, what was that
about earlier?

01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:27.243
Yeah, nothing. Later.
What?

01:13:29.826 --> 01:13:31.076
Wha...?

01:13:32.201 --> 01:13:33.951
Oh, gosh!

01:13:34.118 --> 01:13:36.368
It's happening.
It's really happening.

01:13:36.535 --> 01:13:39.243
We can do this.
I don't know if I can.

01:13:39.410 --> 01:13:41.118
We'll do it together.
Okay?

01:13:43.493 --> 01:13:45.701
One.

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:49.118
Two.

01:13:51.493 --> 01:13:52.535
Three.

01:13:55.368 --> 01:13:57.326
Hello, boobs.

01:14:00.035 --> 01:14:01.160
Are they okay?

01:14:02.368 --> 01:14:03.993
They're fucking fabulous.

01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:06.826
Thank you.

01:14:09.201 --> 01:14:12.285
Oh. And just so you know, um,

01:14:12.451 --> 01:14:16.743
I've never been able to orgasm,
so no pressure.

01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:18.826
I'm all about giving pleasure.

01:14:18.993 --> 01:14:21.076
This is so much better
than porn.

01:14:29.493 --> 01:14:31.493
Well, hey-o.

01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:33.118
Oh, my God!

01:14:33.285 --> 01:14:34.285
I told you so.

01:14:34.451 --> 01:14:35.535
You weren't kidding.

01:14:36.201 --> 01:14:39.118
That is remarkable
that he is insecure.

01:14:42.035 --> 01:14:44.035
Tequila!

01:14:44.201 --> 01:14:45.951
<i>You got what I need</i>

01:14:49.701 --> 01:14:51.826
<i>And you say He's just a friend?</i>

01:14:51.993 --> 01:14:54.868
<i>Oh, baby, you?</i>

01:14:55.034 --> 01:14:58.034
<i>Got what I need</i>

01:14:58.201 --> 01:15:00.409
<i>But you say He's just a friend?</i>

01:15:03.159 --> 01:15:06.118
<i>Oh, baby, you?</i>

01:15:06.284 --> 01:15:08.368
<i>Got whet I need?</i>

01:15:08.534 --> 01:15:11.118
Everybody, drink from the ceiling.

01:15:21.159 --> 01:15:23.243
Hey, Mike.
Hi there.

01:15:23.409 --> 01:15:27.451
You guys have goth try these chocolate-covered
strawberries. They're so decadent.

01:15:27.618 --> 01:15:29.909
Oh, no, no. I'm good.
I just had some Bagel Bites.

01:15:30.076 --> 01:15:33.409
Where'd you get Bagel Bites?
Shh. Forget it.

01:15:33.576 --> 01:15:35.159
Mahalo, freaky people.

01:15:35.326 --> 01:15:39.076
We were thinking it might be fun if we
all went out and made love in the pool.

01:15:39.243 --> 01:15:41.576
Yes, yes.
Yeah, you wanna go in the pool?

01:15:41.743 --> 01:15:44.118
No. No, no. We're good
right here. We're good.

01:15:44.284 --> 01:15:45.743
Oh, we're okay.
Yeah.

01:15:45.909 --> 01:15:49.076
Thanks though.
It's chlorinated. Have fun.

01:15:51.493 --> 01:15:53.534
Sue, I'm so happy for you.

01:15:53.701 --> 01:15:56.784
All right, Hey, guys, could we
just get a minute? Just a minute?

01:15:56.951 --> 01:15:58.784
Yeah, just give us
a sec, will you?

01:15:58.951 --> 01:16:01.868
Oh, so sorry.

01:16:02.034 --> 01:16:05.368
We're not giving you
enough privacy at an orgy?

01:16:05.534 --> 01:16:09.159
Oh, kind of a fair hit.
Yeah, now, shh.

01:16:09.326 --> 01:16:11.201
Are you okay?
You wanna talk or something?

01:16:11.368 --> 01:16:14.201
No, no.
Just be in the moment.

01:16:14.368 --> 01:16:17.409
Okay. Yeah, no, can do. Can do.
Okay. Okay.

01:16:19.993 --> 01:16:22.076
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.
Oh, yeah?

01:16:22.243 --> 01:16:23.701
You like to dirty talk?
Yeah?

01:16:23.868 --> 01:16:25.576
Ooh, fuck.
Okay, you wanna fuck me?

01:16:25.743 --> 01:16:28.576
You wanna fuck me hard?
No, Sue. Hop off. My foot, my foot.

01:16:28.743 --> 01:16:29.784
Oh, oh, okay.

01:16:29.951 --> 01:16:31.034
Oh, foot cramp.
Oh!

01:16:31.201 --> 01:16:32.493
Okay.
Ooh, that's a doozie.

01:16:32.659 --> 01:16:33.826
Shh. Okay. All right

01:16:33.993 --> 01:16:36.784
Oh, God, my big toe's so far
away from my other toes.

01:16:36.951 --> 01:16:38.826
Okay, hey.
Hey, flex it out.

01:16:38.993 --> 01:16:40.659
Flex it out. Flex it, okay.

01:16:40.826 --> 01:16:43.076
Oh, we should have
done this 15 years ago.

01:16:43.576 --> 01:16:45.493
Hey, guys.

01:16:45.659 --> 01:16:47.993
I broke my diet.

01:16:50.659 --> 01:16:52.493
Okay. You're good?
Oh, yeah.

01:16:52.659 --> 01:16:54.534
Yeah? You're good?
Okay. There it goes.

01:16:54.701 --> 01:16:57.034
There it goes. Oh, wow.
Okay.

01:16:57.201 --> 01:16:58.951
Shh! Okay. Okay.
Okay.

01:16:59.118 --> 01:17:02.409
Oh, no, it's back.
It's back worse!

01:17:02.576 --> 01:17:04.659
Ooh, it's... The little guy
is in on it now.

01:17:04.826 --> 01:17:07.451
Hey, gang. Sake bombs.

01:17:16.868 --> 01:17:18.118
Oh, my God!

01:17:18.284 --> 01:17:20.951
Oh, my God, my dick is having
the best night of its life.

01:17:21.118 --> 01:17:23.993
Oh, we're all fucking.
Oh, we're all finally fucking.

01:17:24.159 --> 01:17:26.201
Oh, and I can be as loud
as I fucking want!

01:17:26.368 --> 01:17:27.409
Oh, no. Shh, shh.

01:17:29.951 --> 01:17:31.368
Owl Ow, my contact.

01:17:31.534 --> 01:17:32.951
Alison, my contact.

01:17:33.118 --> 01:17:36.159
I'm good. I'm good. Play through.
Bro, count me down.

01:17:36.326 --> 01:17:38.784
What?
Count me down from five.

01:17:38.951 --> 01:17:41.993
What does that even mean?
Oh, fuck! Count me down from 10.

01:17:42.159 --> 01:17:44.368
Count him down, Adam.
Just count him down.

01:17:45.868 --> 01:17:48.284
This whole sex in the pool thing
is not working.

01:17:48.451 --> 01:17:50.951
Water is not a lubricant.

01:17:51.118 --> 01:17:54.409
Okay, brothers and sisters.
Let's hike this party indoors.

01:17:54.576 --> 01:17:57.201
I'm running with a boner!

01:17:57.576 --> 01:17:59.076
Pineapple mojitos.

01:18:00.451 --> 01:18:01.909
Yeah, mulched with fresh mint.

01:18:03.701 --> 01:18:04.743
Fuck!

01:18:04.909 --> 01:18:06.034
Are you ready?

01:18:06.201 --> 01:18:08.284
As I'll ever be.

01:18:12.743 --> 01:18:15.076
Ooh!
I'm next, I'm next, I'm next.

01:18:16.326 --> 01:18:17.368
Vodka tonic.

01:18:22.951 --> 01:18:25.867
Yo, can I tag in?

01:18:26.034 --> 01:18:29.451
Oh! You're like the sweet,
tender lion.

01:18:29.617 --> 01:18:31.242
Mike, go away.

01:18:31.409 --> 01:18:34.867
You guys haven't slept with anybody else yet.
You're hogging Willow.

01:18:35.034 --> 01:18:36.701
Go away.

01:18:36.867 --> 01:18:38.576
Go away, Mike.

01:18:38.742 --> 01:18:39.784
Vodka.

01:18:41.159 --> 01:18:42.201
Come on.

01:18:42.367 --> 01:18:46.409
Sue, I just wanna say I'm so sorry
about the whole Eric thing.

01:18:46.576 --> 01:18:49.867
No. Totally don't.
It's so over. I don't care.

01:18:50.034 --> 01:18:54.701
No, but you know, you're a really
good friend and I love you.

01:18:54.867 --> 01:18:59.159
No, I love you.
You are so smart and you're so beautiful.

01:18:59.326 --> 01:19:03.034
And I totally get why he would
wanna be with you.

01:19:03.201 --> 01:19:04.576
You're the beautiful one.

01:19:04.742 --> 01:19:07.576
Oh, my God,
your body is ridiculous.

01:19:07.742 --> 01:19:09.867
Your body is ridiculous, okay?

01:19:10.034 --> 01:19:13.159
And I would give anything
to have your breasts

01:19:13.326 --> 01:19:14.951
just for, like, one day.

01:19:15.117 --> 01:19:19.534
Yeah, but your ass
is off the charts, seriously.

01:19:19.742 --> 01:19:22.076
Okay. I would kill
to have your eyes.

01:19:22.242 --> 01:19:25.992
You know that you have
the most beautiful green eyes

01:19:26.159 --> 01:19:29.284
that I have ever seen.

01:19:34.826 --> 01:19:36.242
Oh, yeah.

01:19:41.409 --> 01:19:42.909
Oh, yeah
Oh!

01:19:43.576 --> 01:19:44.826
Wow!

01:19:44.992 --> 01:19:46.159
I saw that.
You see that?

01:19:46.326 --> 01:19:50.034
It looked like a little flash of light.
I know. I think I just... God.

01:19:50.742 --> 01:19:52.659
I never thought I'd
hear myself say this,

01:19:52.826 --> 01:19:55.034
but I'm gonna hike a break

01:19:55.201 --> 01:19:58.076
from this
girl-on-girl-on-girl action

01:19:58.242 --> 01:20:01.701
and check the score
of the Yankee game.

01:20:01.867 --> 01:20:03.867
This feels fucking fabulous.

01:20:08.117 --> 01:20:09.117
Ah, Michael!

01:20:09.784 --> 01:20:11.492
Let's go.
Are you sure?

01:20:11.659 --> 01:20:13.617
Yes, 100,000 percent sure.

01:20:13.784 --> 01:20:16.201
Let's go. Right now.
Okay, okay. Let's go.

01:20:16.367 --> 01:20:19.951
You fucking did it. Look at this.
You are awe-inspiring.

01:20:20.117 --> 01:20:21.201
Oh.

01:20:21.367 --> 01:20:22.534
Thank you, Mike.
No.

01:20:22.701 --> 01:20:26.951
I'm gonna tell you something right now and I
want you to listen because I fucking mean it.

01:20:27.117 --> 01:20:28.659
Okay...

01:20:28.826 --> 01:20:31.742
You could be the president
of the United States.

01:20:33.659 --> 01:20:35.492
Well, not after
something like this.

01:20:35.659 --> 01:20:38.909
Hey, shh, no.
I'm fucking serious.

01:20:39.076 --> 01:20:42.117
You could do it
if you wanted to.

01:20:42.284 --> 01:20:44.117
Yeah.

01:20:44.284 --> 01:20:46.159
You're getting kind of close,
Mike.

01:20:46.326 --> 01:20:47.742
Am I?
Yeah.

01:20:47.909 --> 01:20:49.159
Oh.

01:20:49.326 --> 01:20:51.617
You're not trying to kiss me,
are you?

01:20:51.784 --> 01:20:53.409
Would it scare you if I was?

01:20:54.326 --> 01:20:56.117
I guess So.

01:20:56.284 --> 01:20:58.617
Fucking kiss chicken, dude.

01:20:58.784 --> 01:21:01.076
It's on.
All right.

01:21:01.242 --> 01:21:02.909
Let me just
set this right here.

01:21:03.076 --> 01:21:04.659
Whatever.

01:21:11.617 --> 01:21:13.784
You scared yet?

01:21:14.909 --> 01:21:15.992
No.

01:21:16.159 --> 01:21:18.409
- No?
Mm-mm.

01:21:18.576 --> 01:21:22.076
How about now?
Touching your nose with my nose.

01:21:22.242 --> 01:21:24.409
It's okay, I'm part Eskimo.

01:21:24.617 --> 01:21:26.534
We're nose-kissing, buddy.

01:21:26.701 --> 01:21:29.076
It's more than our noses
touching right now.

01:21:29.242 --> 01:21:31.576
It's our souls.

01:21:36.576 --> 01:21:38.409
Yeah, that's been brewing
for years.

01:21:38.576 --> 01:21:39.867
Well, I think we both won.

01:21:41.992 --> 01:21:43.742
I'm pretty sure
we both just lost.

01:21:47.951 --> 01:21:49.784
- Tonic.
- Boo!

01:21:52.742 --> 01:21:55.784
Don't stop. Don't stop. Don't stop.
Almost there. Almost there.

01:21:55.950 --> 01:21:58.200
No, don't stop. Don't stop.
Ah! Don't stop.

01:21:58.575 --> 01:22:01.617
It feels so good.
It feels so good, don't stop.

01:22:03.492 --> 01:22:05.492
Hm?
Mmm.

01:22:05.659 --> 01:22:06.659
How about that?

01:22:06.825 --> 01:22:09.242
So how long
has this been going on?

01:22:09.409 --> 01:22:10.659
About a half an hour.

01:22:10.825 --> 01:22:12.825
I'm good. I'm gonna...
I'm getting it. Ah!

01:22:12.992 --> 01:22:14.075
Poor bastard.

01:22:14.242 --> 01:22:16.200
Fucking so good. Aahl

01:22:16.367 --> 01:22:17.659
Hang in there, buddy.

01:22:17.825 --> 01:22:18.992
Almost there.

01:22:19.159 --> 01:22:22.450
Yeah. Yes. Yes!

01:22:22.617 --> 01:22:24.409
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I'm coming.

01:22:24.575 --> 01:22:27.075
Yes! Oh, yes!

01:22:27.242 --> 01:22:28.825
Yes, yes, yes!

01:22:28.992 --> 01:22:31.825
Oh, yes! Yes!

01:22:31.992 --> 01:22:34.784
Yes! Aahl

01:22:54.325 --> 01:22:57.117
Hey! Good morning, everybody.

01:22:57.284 --> 01:22:59.325
So, uh, look what I got.

01:22:59.492 --> 01:23:01.950
Commemorative Labor Day
orgy T-shirts right here.

01:23:02.117 --> 01:23:03.450
Pink and blue.

01:23:03.617 --> 01:23:05.742
Unisex, 100 percent cotton.

01:23:05.909 --> 01:23:06.950
You made T-shirts?

01:23:07.117 --> 01:23:08.534
Yup. Laura.

01:23:08.867 --> 01:23:10.534
Huh?

01:23:11.325 --> 01:23:12.700
Where are we gonna wear these?

01:23:12.867 --> 01:23:15.325
Anywhere.
What do you mean?

01:23:15.909 --> 01:23:19.284
Jesus Christ, I am
hungover like a madman.

01:23:20.617 --> 01:23:22.825
All right, ladies.
Ladies, I got one...

01:23:22.992 --> 01:23:24.534
One easy question for all of you.

01:23:25.075 --> 01:23:28.284
Overall,
where would you rank me?

01:23:28.450 --> 01:23:29.825
Just have a bagel and relax.

01:23:29.992 --> 01:23:32.450
Listen, I need to know.
I just... I need to know.

01:23:32.617 --> 01:23:36.409
Well, for me,
there was one clear winner.

01:23:36.575 --> 01:23:40.159
Okay, I know, good. Eric. Blah, blah.
Big surprise. What about this guy?

01:23:40.325 --> 01:23:43.409
I was gonna say Adam.
Adam.

01:23:43.575 --> 01:23:44.825
What?

01:23:44.992 --> 01:23:47.492
For a neurotic hypochondriac
with panic attacks,

01:23:47.659 --> 01:23:50.117
he was really uninhibited.

01:23:50.284 --> 01:23:52.575
So what? Out of the four dudes
in the house,

01:23:52.742 --> 01:23:55.992
I didn't even rank in the top two?
That's what you're telling me?

01:23:56.159 --> 01:23:57.284
Didn't I do my move?

01:23:57.450 --> 01:24:00.159
The move with the fingers
and the tongue? The Thoosh?

01:24:00.534 --> 01:24:02.117
- Laura.
- You did it.

01:24:02.284 --> 01:24:05.242
I thooshed you. I know I did.
You don't need to do it now.

01:24:05.409 --> 01:24:07.075
We don't need to see it again.

01:24:07.242 --> 01:24:08.950
Yeah. Can we just
eat breakfast?

01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:12.700
It's Marcus.

01:24:16.159 --> 01:24:17.534
Hello?

01:24:18.534 --> 01:24:20.367
Oh, tell him how much
we missed him.

01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:23.700
Hey.
Everybody's up.

01:24:23.867 --> 01:24:24.909
Hey.

01:24:25.075 --> 01:24:26.284
Morning.

01:24:26.450 --> 01:24:28.867
Hey, man, about the shit
that went down last night...

01:24:29.034 --> 01:24:33.409
Dude. Oh, shit, I'm sorry if I did anything
weird to you or Willow, like, any thooshing.

01:24:33.575 --> 01:24:37.700
Anything like that. I'm sorry.
I was so fucking hammered, I don't remember anything.

01:24:37.867 --> 01:24:38.909
Seriously, nothing?

01:24:39.075 --> 01:24:41.075
You don't remember anything?
No.

01:24:41.242 --> 01:24:44.784
Nothing. I remember the fucking
absinthe shots and then that's it.

01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:49.367
I'm so bummed, that was gonna be spank
fodder for the next 20 years of my life.

01:24:49.534 --> 01:24:51.867
Total fucking blackout
Thank God.

01:24:52.034 --> 01:24:53.242
Amen.

01:24:53.409 --> 01:24:54.492
I got something for you.

01:24:54.659 --> 01:24:56.742
Holy shit!
Dougie.

01:24:56.909 --> 01:24:58.575
I did it. I got more coming.

01:24:58.742 --> 01:25:00.534
Oh, my God, dude,
this is major.

01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:05.367
I wanted hat, but he was
so passionate about no hat.

01:25:05.534 --> 01:25:07.534
No fucking hat.
Good shit, man.

01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:09.825
I still would've
Photoshopped in the dudes

01:25:09.992 --> 01:25:12.159
schnizzing on your face.
But it's just me.

01:25:12.325 --> 01:25:13.742
You made fucking shirts.
Fuck.

01:25:13.909 --> 01:25:16.325
Yeah. Hey, Willow,
grab one of those.

01:25:16.492 --> 01:25:18.325
It's blue and pink,
my favorite.

01:25:18.492 --> 01:25:21.408
- A medium. Awesome.
- It's the Breakfast Club.

01:25:21.575 --> 01:25:24.283
Oh, there he is.
Sam Rockwell.

01:25:24.450 --> 01:25:26.658
Ha, yeah, there you go.

01:25:28.492 --> 01:25:30.742
Thank you, I'm sorry,
and you're welcome.

01:25:33.575 --> 01:25:34.742
Still a little sore.

01:25:38.242 --> 01:25:39.283
Hi.

01:25:40.658 --> 01:25:43.200
Yeah, I think
we're headed down shortly.

01:25:44.117 --> 01:25:45.908
Yeah, I'll see you there.

01:25:47.033 --> 01:25:49.450
That was Kelly.
Slut.

01:25:49.617 --> 01:25:51.992
- Ooh!
- Uh, she's, uh,

01:25:52.158 --> 01:25:53.992
headed to the beach.
I'm gonna meet her.

01:25:54.158 --> 01:25:57.158
That's gonna be some awkward shit.
I wanna be front-row center.

01:25:57.325 --> 01:25:58.950
Let's do it.
I'm there.

01:26:00.408 --> 01:26:02.450
Give the ticks a goodbye hug
for me, please?

01:26:02.617 --> 01:26:04.617
- I will do so.
- Okay.

01:26:08.408 --> 01:26:09.950
Hhhh...

01:26:10.117 --> 01:26:13.533
I can stay here
and hang out with you if...

01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:15.450
Yeah, yes.

01:26:15.658 --> 01:26:16.742
Okay, heh.

01:26:16.908 --> 01:26:20.283
We could, uh, hike a dip
in the pool or something.

01:26:20.450 --> 01:26:22.450
Oh, the... Yeah.
I don't know about the pool

01:26:22.617 --> 01:26:24.742
after what happened
in there last night.

01:26:24.908 --> 01:26:25.992
Ew.

01:26:26.450 --> 01:26:29.242
But you wanna
do the crossword with me?

01:26:30.075 --> 01:26:31.408
I'd love that.

01:26:33.617 --> 01:26:35.367
Uh, 16 Across.

01:26:36.617 --> 01:26:39.617
So, what happened
with, uh, you-know-who?

01:26:39.783 --> 01:26:42.742
Marcus apologized.
He wants to go to couples therapy.

01:26:42.908 --> 01:26:44.200
You're getting back together?

01:26:44.367 --> 01:26:47.492
We're gonna go to city hall, get
married, see if we can make it work.

01:26:47.658 --> 01:26:49.575
What the fuck?
Just kidding.

01:26:51.075 --> 01:26:55.033
Okay.
Yeah, no, it's totally over.

01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:57.117
Nice.
I'm proud of you.

01:26:57.283 --> 01:26:58.533
Thanks, Sue.

01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:01.033
That's too bad.
I always liked that guy.

01:27:01.742 --> 01:27:03.825
God, I hope
Kate has some guys for us.

01:27:03.992 --> 01:27:06.033
Hell, I'd even go to Hoboken.

01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:09.325
I mean, if he's really amazing, I'd
consider going to Jersey City.

01:27:09.492 --> 01:27:10.533
Oh, you would not.

01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:12.700
I'm just making a point.

01:27:12.867 --> 01:27:15.533
Uh, so Eric, um, last night,

01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:17.242
Oh.
Some things came up.

01:27:17.408 --> 01:27:19.867
Yeah, I swear.
I had no idea.

01:27:20.033 --> 01:27:22.242
No, it's fine, really.
It was just something

01:27:22.408 --> 01:27:24.367
that I needed
to get out of my system.

01:27:31.742 --> 01:27:33.533
I hope she likes
my sloppy seconds.

01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:35.575
Oh, come on.

01:27:36.617 --> 01:27:39.575
Morning, Kelly.
Hey. Morning, Eric.

01:27:39.742 --> 01:27:41.492
Hey.

01:27:41.658 --> 01:27:43.533
Hi, I'm Mike.
We haven't officially met.

01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:45.825
Nice to meet you.
Oh, wait, Mike.

01:27:45.992 --> 01:27:49.033
Right. You're the guy
that Dody was asking about.

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:52.658
She wanted your number for some kind
of business thing or something?

01:27:54.742 --> 01:27:57.158
Ah, what the fuck.
Give her my digits, all right?

01:27:57.325 --> 01:27:59.367
Nice to meet you.

01:27:59.533 --> 01:28:03.158
Let loose the Kraken. Yeah.

01:28:03.325 --> 01:28:06.075
So wow. Okay.

01:28:06.242 --> 01:28:07.742
About last night.
How about this?

01:28:07.908 --> 01:28:09.658
What?
How about this about last night?

01:28:09.825 --> 01:28:12.992
We never talk about it
ever, ever again.

01:28:13.658 --> 01:28:15.242
It never happened.
All right?

01:28:15.867 --> 01:28:17.617
You and I have just met.

01:28:17.783 --> 01:28:20.200
We're starting fresh
right here, right now.

01:28:21.783 --> 01:28:23.283
Done.

01:28:23.450 --> 01:28:24.617
Done.

01:28:24.783 --> 01:28:26.283
Hi, I'm Kelly.
Hi, Kelly. I'm Eric.

01:28:26.450 --> 01:28:28.283
It's nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

01:28:39.783 --> 01:28:40.950
Hey!

01:28:47.616 --> 01:28:48.991
Your blackberry.

01:28:49.158 --> 01:28:51.866
Ah! Just an empty
symbolic gesture.

01:28:52.033 --> 01:28:53.533
I'm getting a new one
on Tuesday.

01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:56.991
But that did feel really,
really good.

01:28:57.158 --> 01:28:58.991
So this is the beach, huh?

01:28:59.158 --> 01:29:00.658
Pretty beautiful. Who knew?

01:29:00.825 --> 01:29:02.741
This is it.
Let's go on.

01:29:08.533 --> 01:29:10.283
Okay, listen.
I've got some bad news.

01:29:10.450 --> 01:29:11.991
You're al Qaeda.
No.

01:29:12.158 --> 01:29:14.491
You know the delay I pulled
with closing the house?

01:29:14.658 --> 01:29:16.575
It spooked the buyers
and they pulled out.

01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:19.450
The house isn't sold?
No.

01:29:21.825 --> 01:29:23.741
Are you mad?
No. No, no, no.

01:29:23.908 --> 01:29:25.408
Will you hold on a sec though?

01:29:25.575 --> 01:29:26.700
Hey, guys!
Yeah?

01:29:26.866 --> 01:29:29.450
Quick announcement.
I have a really shitty Realtor.

01:29:29.616 --> 01:29:31.575
Fire her.
And she blew the deal.

01:29:31.741 --> 01:29:33.575
And the house still isn't sold.

01:29:38.075 --> 01:29:39.325
They're pissed.
They're mad.

01:29:39.491 --> 01:29:41.658
Great, now they're pissed.
They're mad.

01:29:41.825 --> 01:29:45.408
Now I goth shirt thinking of
something to do for Memorial Day.

01:29:45.575 --> 01:29:48.033
We've been kicking around
this idea for a brown party.

01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:50.200
You know brown clothes,
brown food.

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:54.283
Hey, you guys
remember Kelly, right?

01:29:59.491 --> 01:30:02.825
