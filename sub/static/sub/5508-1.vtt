MAN: (NARRATING)
Some of this is legend,

00:32.366 --> 00:34.534
but at least
this much is fact.

00:34.618 --> 00:39.038
When rioting citizens
of France
destroyed the Bastille,

00:39.123 --> 00:43.751
they discovered
within its records
this mysterious entry:

00:43.836 --> 00:45.128

PORTHOS: Oh,
I'm sorry, my dears.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.876
You would have
enjoyed it too.

02:48.961 --> 02:50.336
He's hung like a donkey.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.839
(GIGGLES)
So are you.

02:52.923 --> 02:54.257
Really?
Yeah.

02:54.341 --> 02:57.593
He's been asleep so long,
I've forgotten about him.

02:57.678 --> 02:58.886
Okay, go on now. Go on.

02:58.971 --> 02:59.971
(GROANING)

03:00.055 --> 03:01.848
Yes, leave his
holiness alone.

03:01.932 --> 03:04.100
I'll bring you back tomorrow
when he's in a better mood.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.184
Go on.

03:15.612 --> 03:18.030
Stop praying
and revel with me, Aramis!

03:18.115 --> 03:21.617
I need my spirits lifted!
I'm old! I'm weak!

03:21.702 --> 03:22.869
My strength is gone!

03:22.953 --> 03:23.953
Porthos.

03:25.622 --> 03:26.664
I'm praying.

03:26.748 --> 03:27.999
I just said
you're praying.

03:28.083 --> 03:30.793
Are you deaf too?
I know you're blind.

03:30.878 --> 03:34.463
If you'd seen the tits
that just walked out,

03:34.548 --> 03:36.257
you'd have tears
in your eyes.

03:36.341 --> 03:39.468
Sometimes there are more
important things to life
than a good pair of tits.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.596
Really?

03:41.680 --> 03:46.726
Aramis... If you can
name me one thing,

03:46.810 --> 03:50.021
one single thing
that is more sublime...

03:50.105 --> 03:54.942
Than the feel of a plump,
pink nipple between my lips...

03:55.027 --> 03:57.111
I'll build you
a new cathedral.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.239

Forgiveness?

04:08.123 --> 04:10.791
Forgive me.

04:10.876 --> 04:12.919
Forgive me.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.921
Am I forgiven?

04:17.174 --> 04:19.926
Hmm? Am I forgiven?

04:22.179 --> 04:23.846
(GROANS)

04:23.931 --> 04:26.974
I observe your
forgiveness isn't sweeter
than a plump nipple.

04:27.059 --> 04:29.352
Don't you understand?

04:29.436 --> 04:31.771
I'm trying to pray!

04:31.855 --> 04:34.065
You're always praying!

04:44.701 --> 04:45.785
How are you,
young pup?

04:45.869 --> 04:46.827
Porthos.

04:46.912 --> 04:49.288
You interrupted a simple
theological discussion.

04:49.373 --> 04:50.414
So I see.

04:50.499 --> 04:51.457
Welcome. Sit.

04:51.541 --> 04:55.962
I wish that I could,
Aramis, but I come upon
the King's business.

04:56.046 --> 04:57.129
He wishes to see you.

04:57.214 --> 04:58.589
Still you serve him loyally,

04:58.674 --> 05:02.218
even though the people
throw rotten eggs
at his royal emblem.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.887
D'Artagnan,
look at you.

05:04.972 --> 05:09.058
You look so young...
And I feel so old.

05:14.022 --> 05:16.065
The King says immediately.

05:19.403 --> 05:21.362
One for all, D'Artagnan.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.157
And all for one.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.953
(DOOR CLOSES)

05:29.037 --> 05:31.372
We were all
musketeers once, eh?

05:36.336 --> 05:39.422
I wonder how
Athos is doing.

05:39.923 --> 05:43.634
Relax, Raoul.
After all, you're my son.

05:43.719 --> 05:45.511
How could any woman
resist you?

05:45.595 --> 05:46.804
(CHUCKLES)

05:46.888 --> 05:48.723
When will you ask her?

05:48.807 --> 05:51.559
Today... As we arrive.

05:52.269 --> 05:53.853
Or, perhaps,
when we are leaving.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.771
When I think of it,
I get so confused.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.357
Will this help?

06:02.195 --> 06:05.906
Mother's ring.
No, I can't take this.
It's yours.

06:05.991 --> 06:07.616
She died
giving you to me.

06:07.701 --> 06:12.204
I want to die
knowing it's on the finger
of the woman my son loves.

06:12.289 --> 06:15.416
Go. Bring back
your fiancée.

06:46.656 --> 06:50.201
Your Majesty, the attack
will come at dawn.

06:50.285 --> 06:53.204
No, no. Do not
underestimate
the Dutch.

06:57.584 --> 07:01.045
These troops
will be cut off here,
so shift them here and here.

07:01.129 --> 07:04.715
And then
we outnumber them there.
Yes, send that on its way.

07:04.841 --> 07:05.841
Your Majesty.
The yellow sash.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.095
As your advisors,
we feel it is our...

07:10.388 --> 07:12.264
Our duty.
Yes.

07:12.349 --> 07:16.602
Yes, our duty
to inform you that
there are riots in Paris.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.522
Riots?

07:19.606 --> 07:22.441
But Paris is the most
beautiful city in the world.

07:22.526 --> 07:26.612
Why should my people
feel anything but...
Pride and contentment?

07:26.696 --> 07:30.741
Of course, Your Majesty.
I'm sure they are
content and proud.

07:30.826 --> 07:32.368
But they are
also starving.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.412
Your Majesty,
if we distributed
some of the food...

07:35.497 --> 07:36.789
Reserved for the Army...

07:36.873 --> 07:37.873
ANNOUNCER:
The priest, Aramis.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.501
There would be time
to gather more...

07:52.389 --> 07:57.351
Father Aramis, His Majesty
is experiencing difficulty
with the Jesuits.

07:57.435 --> 07:58.477
The Jesuits?

07:58.562 --> 08:01.021
They have declared
His Majesty's wars
unjust...

08:01.106 --> 08:03.232
And the source
of public hunger.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.818
Perhaps His Majesty
should speak
to their leader.

08:05.902 --> 08:10.197
Yes, but who is he?
No one can keep secrets
like the Jesuits can.

08:10.282 --> 08:11.657
Ah, Aramis.

08:12.409 --> 08:13.909
Your Majesty.

08:20.375 --> 08:25.087
You are a priest,
but once you were
a musketeer.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.006
I, like my father
before me,

08:27.090 --> 08:30.092
have trusted you
with the gravest
of missions.

08:30.886 --> 08:32.011
So...

08:35.682 --> 08:38.684
I want you to find out
who the secret leader
of the Jesuits is.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.519
And when you have,

08:40.604 --> 08:44.440
for God and for France,
I wish you to kill him.

08:48.195 --> 08:53.782
I know this is a terrible
thing I ask, especially
from a priest, but...

08:54.784 --> 08:57.077
Can you accept
this mission...

08:57.162 --> 08:59.288
And keep it private?

09:02.834 --> 09:06.795
When I discover the identity
of this Jesuit rebel,

09:09.466 --> 09:12.676
I will kill both him
and the man who told me.

09:13.595 --> 09:17.765
Once a musketeer,
always a musketeer, huh?

09:20.310 --> 09:22.102
(CLEARS THROAT)
Now, about these riots.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.563
We have stocks
on the wharves
right now, don't we?

09:24.648 --> 09:26.565
We can distribute that.

09:26.650 --> 09:28.567
But, Majesty,
that food is spoiling.

09:28.652 --> 09:31.570
That is why it was not
sent to the Army.

09:31.655 --> 09:33.948
Then you must hurry.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.825
What an excellent idea,
Your Majesty.

09:37.327 --> 09:39.578
Look at the stitching
on that one.

09:39.663 --> 09:42.122
Don't they
look glorious?

09:42.207 --> 09:44.500
Not so glorious
as you.

09:49.881 --> 09:51.340
Who is that?

09:53.510 --> 09:55.844
Raoul,
the son of Athos.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.305
François,
your taste may run
to young soldiers,

09:58.390 --> 10:00.683

to the beauty next to him.

Assassins falling
from the skies?

10:57.532 --> 10:59.700
The plans for the pig chase
were not revealed to me.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.118
D'Artagnan...

11:01.202 --> 11:03.162
Look at the faces
of these men.

11:03.246 --> 11:04.663
How they admire
and fear you.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.540
With the great D'Artagnan
watching over me,

11:06.624 --> 11:10.002
who in France
would be possibly such a fool
as to try and do me harm?

11:10.086 --> 11:12.838
A fool's blade can be
sharper than his brain.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.923
Let us play a game.

as if I am king...

And you are the captain
of my musketeers.

11:19.721 --> 11:21.513
Let us behave
as if my wish is law.

11:21.598 --> 11:24.850
And my wish, D'Artagnan,
is to enjoy this party.

has withdrawn his request
to join the musketeers.

(STOPS PLAYING)

18:57.720 --> 18:59.137

18:59.889 --> 19:01.056
You have improved.

19:01.390 --> 19:03.266
It's been so long.

19:03.351 --> 19:05.185
So it has, my friend.

19:06.646 --> 19:07.979
What's the occasion?

19:08.064 --> 19:10.273
As you say,
it's been too long.

19:10.358 --> 19:13.777
When the great D'Artagnan
visits, he must be offered
the best wine.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.862
And if the great
Athos offers,

19:15.947 --> 19:19.032
then the great D'Artagnan
must drink.

19:19.826 --> 19:23.787
I'm sorry I haven't been
to see you lately, my friend.

19:23.871 --> 19:25.455

19:25.540 --> 19:27.582
That must
keep you busy.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.543
Especially with this king.

19:29.627 --> 19:32.754
Still, I should have come
to see you more often.

19:33.464 --> 19:37.843
I belong to the past,
when the uniforms were black
and grown men wore them.

19:37.927 --> 19:40.762
At least it gives you
more time to practice
your violin.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.890
And feel sorry
for myself.

19:43.975 --> 19:46.518
My son is grown.
He's proposed
to a wonderful girl.

19:46.602 --> 19:50.522
He's joined the musketeers.
All the errors of my life
are made right in him.

19:50.606 --> 19:54.734
And now, for the life
I've always wished him,
he's leaving my home.

come to visit.

20:06.998 --> 20:08.707
What's the matter?

20:11.210 --> 20:14.588
I cannot risk making
her a widow just as
I was to make her a wife.

20:15.965 --> 20:17.632
I've been recalled
to my regiment.

20:18.259 --> 20:20.260
But that makes no sense.

20:20.344 --> 20:22.470
You've already served
at the front.

20:22.805 --> 20:25.640
Has there been
some disaster?

20:30.104 --> 20:32.647
Has everyone else
been recalled?

20:32.732 --> 20:35.984
I believe the King's eye
has fallen on Christine.

20:36.068 --> 20:39.988
The King has noticed her,
but I don't think it has
anything to do with Raoul.

20:40.072 --> 20:43.199
It has everything
to do with it.
The King is a dog!

20:43.284 --> 20:44.284
Athos.

20:44.368 --> 20:45.368
A dog and a coward.

20:45.453 --> 20:47.662
But I am neither,
and so I go.

20:48.164 --> 20:49.414
Raoul...

20:51.083 --> 20:54.085
D'Artagnan, does the King
have trouble finding women?

20:54.170 --> 20:56.254
Does he have trouble
filling his bed?

20:56.339 --> 20:58.381
I served his father.

20:58.466 --> 21:01.676
Until I retired,
I served him.

21:01.761 --> 21:06.598
And now, to seduce a woman
who will mean nothing to him
once he has had her,

21:06.682 --> 21:09.517
he would put
my son's life
in danger?

21:10.478 --> 21:12.103
You knew
this was happening.

21:12.188 --> 21:14.898
That's why you came.

21:14.982 --> 21:15.941
I knew your temper.

21:16.025 --> 21:17.359
You came to restrain me?

21:17.443 --> 21:19.110
I came to bring you hope.

21:23.282 --> 21:27.619
(SIGHS) I will speak
to the King personally.

21:27.703 --> 21:31.373
I have not yet lost faith
that he may become the king
we all wish him to be.

21:31.749 --> 21:34.292
You don't know what
it's like to have a son,

21:34.377 --> 21:37.671
to have kissed his hair
and smelled
his breath as he slept,

21:37.755 --> 21:40.465
to have watched him grow.

21:40.549 --> 21:45.136
Yes, fatherhood
is a blessing.

21:45.221 --> 21:47.138
I can only imagine.

21:49.934 --> 21:54.688
D'Artagnan, I have never
known a finer man than you
nor cared more for a friend.

21:54.772 --> 21:58.149
But if this king harms my son
merely to take a lover,

21:58.234 --> 22:00.819
then this king
will become my enemy.

22:00.903 --> 22:04.572
And so will any man
that stands between
that enemy and me.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.992

36:44.494 --> 36:46.871
And the starvation
that results.

36:47.205 --> 36:50.916
So, Louis has ordered me...

36:51.001 --> 36:55.087
To discover
the true identity of the
general of the Jesuit Order...

36:55.505 --> 36:57.464
And to kill him.

37:00.343 --> 37:03.220
Let the secret general
worry about that.

37:03.305 --> 37:05.514
The problem is that...

37:06.975 --> 37:08.267
I am he.

37:11.271 --> 37:14.982
I am the general
of the Order of Jesuits.

37:21.615 --> 37:23.157
What do you
propose to do?

37:24.910 --> 37:26.452
Replace the King.

37:26.536 --> 37:28.162
I cannot listen to this.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.246
It can't be done.

37:29.331 --> 37:31.582
It can. I know the way.

37:33.001 --> 37:34.543
I am with you.

37:36.296 --> 37:37.421
So am I.

37:37.505 --> 37:38.714
No.

37:38.798 --> 37:40.591
I need you.

37:40.675 --> 37:42.760
All for one,
one for all.

37:42.844 --> 37:46.347
You cannot ask me
to betray my king.
I have sworn an oath.

37:46.431 --> 37:50.517
When a king is dishonorable,
you are removed
from your oath of honor.

37:50.602 --> 37:54.021
An oath is an oath precisely
because it cannot be removed!

37:54.105 --> 37:57.608
Why do you follow him?
Why?

37:57.692 --> 38:02.279
What we fought for is greater
than king or rank or reward.

38:02.364 --> 38:03.989
What do you fight for now?

38:04.074 --> 38:08.744
I fight for the belief that
every man can be better,
even Louis.

38:11.206 --> 38:13.207
Whatever the plan,
I am with you.

38:16.211 --> 38:19.380
The next time we meet,
one of us will die.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.343
Athos, wait.

38:24.427 --> 38:25.552
D'Artagnan.

38:27.472 --> 38:28.722
Even were I
not a priest,

38:28.807 --> 38:32.685
I could see that your heart
carries a secret weight,

38:32.769 --> 38:35.187
and that it is hurting you
to bear it alone.

38:37.983 --> 38:42.444
I cannot betray... My King.

38:45.115 --> 38:46.991
I will defend him
with my life.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

39:51.681 --> 39:56.268

there was an incident
at the musketeers' gate...

39:56.352 --> 40:00.230
Where a man came,
intent on killing me.

40:00.315 --> 40:05.069
Is it our policy now to allow
would-be assassins to go free?

40:05.153 --> 40:08.405
What he wished to kill
was his own pain.

40:08.490 --> 40:10.616
His son is dead.

40:12.452 --> 40:13.994
I can think of nothing worse.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.621
What about losing your king?

40:15.705 --> 40:17.706
That depends on the king.

40:22.045 --> 40:26.048
When I became a musketeer,
I was told that each time
I drew my sword,

40:26.132 --> 40:30.010
I should consider
not what I was killing,

40:30.095 --> 40:32.096
but what I was
allowing to live.

40:32.180 --> 40:34.348
Do you know
who told me that?

40:34.682 --> 40:36.225
Athos.

40:37.185 --> 40:41.105
Now if he has become
our enemy...

40:41.189 --> 40:42.981
We should ask ourselves why.

40:43.399 --> 40:45.234
Well, Athos is gone.

40:45.318 --> 40:49.446
Porthos and Aramis
are missing too.

40:49.531 --> 40:52.866

than anyone.

40:52.951 --> 40:54.701
Are they a threat to me?

40:55.245 --> 40:59.706
If they are a threat, then
we need not seek them out.
They will find us.

56:17.082 --> 56:19.083
And with my soul.

56:21.128 --> 56:25.965
One day... I will ask
for your forgiveness.

56:27.634 --> 56:32.180
But not until
I have restored you
to what is yours.

56:32.264 --> 56:33.723
Restored?

56:33.807 --> 56:36.142
We will replace Louis
with Phillippe.

56:36.226 --> 56:37.977
That is your plan?

56:38.437 --> 56:40.605
Exchanging one
for the other?

56:40.981 --> 56:42.190
It's ludicrous!

56:42.274 --> 56:44.192
I can assure you,
it's brilliant.

56:44.276 --> 56:45.443
What did you imagine
we were up to?

56:45.527 --> 56:47.695
Revolution! Open war!

56:47.780 --> 56:49.072
Blood in the streets.

56:49.156 --> 56:50.323
At least it's a change.

56:50.407 --> 56:55.244
Physical resemblance
is but a beginning.
Louis has an arrogance.

56:55.329 --> 56:56.370
ARAMIS: Which
can be adopted.

56:56.455 --> 56:57.747
ATHOS: And people
close to him.

56:57.831 --> 57:00.833
Do you imagine
that I have not
considered everything?

57:00.918 --> 57:06.214
Have you considered it is not
only our lives that you risk?
It is Phillippe's as well.

57:06.298 --> 57:09.092
Yes! And, like us,
he has a choice.

57:12.930 --> 57:14.972
What about it, Phillippe?

57:16.517 --> 57:18.559
All those years
in prison.

57:19.353 --> 57:21.312
Were they
for nothing?

57:21.396 --> 57:24.982
Or have they given you
reserves of strength
unlike ordinary men?

57:25.692 --> 57:28.361
You have the chance
to be a king...

57:29.029 --> 57:32.615
If you have the heart
to take that chance.

57:32.699 --> 57:35.284
Do you have that heart,
Phillippe?

57:35.577 --> 57:36.619
Do you?

57:37.579 --> 57:38.704
I...

57:46.797 --> 57:48.381
ARAMIS: Do you?

58:22.583 --> 58:25.251
Your Majesty,
a box has arrived with
strict instructions...

58:25.335 --> 58:28.087
That its contents
are for your eyes alone.

58:34.261 --> 58:36.179
Take this to my mother.

it is death.

1:01:08.749 --> 1:01:13.836
I know that to love you
is a treason against France,

1:01:13.920 --> 1:01:16.881
but not to love you
is a treason against my heart.

1:01:17.466 --> 1:01:20.301
Then we will both die
traitors, D'Artagnan.

1:01:30.437 --> 1:01:32.104

1:01:45.118 --> 1:01:46.285
More wine!

1:01:46.370 --> 1:01:49.497
You must reconsider
this plan. Phillippe
is like a child.

1:01:49.581 --> 1:01:50.748
He cannot possibly
be ready...

1:01:50.832 --> 1:01:51.874
You can do it.

1:01:51.958 --> 1:01:52.958
No, I can't.

1:01:53.043 --> 1:01:54.043
Yes, you can.

It is our perfect opportunity,
and maybe the only one.

Phillippe will be discovered
at any time, and what then?

Useless.

1:02:37.796 --> 1:02:41.090
Three weeks to learn
all that he must know?

1:02:41.174 --> 1:02:43.759
For 16 years
he was educated
as a gentleman.

1:02:43.844 --> 1:02:47.638
Yes, and for six more
he lived in that mask,
not knowing why.

1:02:47.722 --> 1:02:51.100
Now he knows that those
who should have loved him,

1:02:51.184 --> 1:02:56.355
tore him from his birthright
and threw him into loneliness
and pain.

1:02:57.399 --> 1:02:59.483
You're very fond of him.
That's good.

is he doing?

1:03:19.588 --> 1:03:20.880
About to hang himself,
I should think.

to do it for months.

But now you're asking me
to enter another prison.

1:07:18.076 --> 1:07:19.618
The palace
is hardly a prison.

holding the lamb?

I would tend lambs with her
for the rest of my life.

We're offering you a chance...
To be king.

1:07:36.928 --> 1:07:37.970
No.

1:07:39.013 --> 1:07:42.266
You're offering me a chance
to pretend to be king.

1:07:43.309 --> 1:07:45.477
A king that you hate.

1:07:46.396 --> 1:07:47.980
Not everyone hates him.

1:07:49.399 --> 1:07:50.441

1:07:53.653 --> 1:07:55.112

1:07:55.655 --> 1:07:58.490
Until you give me a reason,
I won't do it.

1:08:01.244 --> 1:08:02.286
I cannot.

1:08:03.204 --> 1:08:06.165
We're all God's instruments,
whether we like it or not.

1:08:06.833 --> 1:08:08.333
All we can do is
to keep faith.

Even though I admit
I sometimes find that
hard to do.

1:08:12.046 --> 1:08:14.590
We all fail at faith,
Aramis, you know?

1:08:14.674 --> 1:08:18.135
That's why we must eat,
drink and make love to life.

if you like
ploughmaids,

1:08:21.222 --> 1:08:23.098

1:08:25.351 --> 1:08:26.310
You missed
the point.

1:08:26.394 --> 1:08:27.394
What point?

1:08:27.479 --> 1:08:29.188
Phillippe is right.

1:08:30.148 --> 1:08:31.440
We haven't given him
a reason...

1:08:31.524 --> 1:08:33.525
To do what
we ask of him.

1:08:34.194 --> 1:08:35.986
I understand
your reason, Athos.

1:08:36.488 --> 1:08:37.988
You understand my reason?

1:08:38.364 --> 1:08:40.574
Porthos told me
about your son.

1:08:45.079 --> 1:08:47.539
And you think
that's why I'm here?

1:08:50.251 --> 1:08:54.254
Yes, Raoul is my reason,
but not in the way you think.

1:08:54.339 --> 1:08:57.174
Once all of us believed
in spending our lives...

1:08:57.258 --> 1:09:00.803
In the service
of something greater
than ourselves.

1:09:00.887 --> 1:09:02.554
Aramis had his faith,

1:09:02.639 --> 1:09:07.476
Porthos, his lust for life,
D'Artagnan, his devotion.

1:09:07.560 --> 1:09:09.186
And I had Raoul.

1:09:10.396 --> 1:09:13.524
But we all had
a common dream:

1:09:13.608 --> 1:09:19.071
One day, we would finally
be able to serve a king
worthy of the throne.

1:09:20.448 --> 1:09:25.244
It is what we dreamt,
what we bled for,

1:09:25.328 --> 1:09:28.455
and what we have spent
a lifetime waiting to see.

1:09:29.541 --> 1:09:33.085
I taught Raoul
to believe
in that dream.

1:09:33.545 --> 1:09:36.672
And now my son is dead.

1:09:38.925 --> 1:09:43.303
So I am here to find out
if his life was in vain.

1:09:45.014 --> 1:09:49.309
The only one who can answer
that question is you.

1:10:06.119 --> 1:10:10.122
Athos, if we fail
in this attempt,

1:10:11.457 --> 1:10:13.959
and we probably will,

1:10:14.961 --> 1:10:16.879
I'll be honored
to die beside you.

1:10:22.886 --> 1:10:24.469
And you.

1:11:46.052 --> 1:11:50.472
in parting from you,
I have left heaven for hell.

1:11:50.556 --> 1:11:55.978
I go because
I can love you
only in honor.

1:11:56.062 --> 1:11:59.648
You've created in me
the need to be a better man.

1:11:59.732 --> 1:12:02.192
I will love through
heaven or hell,

1:12:02.276 --> 1:12:04.236
if that is where
I must go...

1:12:04.320 --> 1:12:06.738
To love you
as you should
be loved.

1:12:07.865 --> 1:12:11.868

and give yourself
no blame.

1:12:58.624 --> 1:13:00.125
What's wrong?

1:13:01.711 --> 1:13:04.671
I received
a letter from Raoul.

1:13:04.756 --> 1:13:06.923
He sent it
to the palace,

1:13:07.383 --> 1:13:09.885
knowing that
he would die...

1:13:09.969 --> 1:13:12.554
And I would be here.

1:13:15.016 --> 1:13:16.725
How would
he know that?

1:13:20.271 --> 1:13:21.855
I...

1:13:22.857 --> 1:13:25.650
I can't guess
what he was thinking.

1:13:25.735 --> 1:13:28.153
He was irrational.

1:13:28.237 --> 1:13:33.742
(SIGHS) I ordered him placed
far from the fighting, but...

1:13:34.702 --> 1:13:35.744
He plunged in...

1:13:36.245 --> 1:13:38.080
Against my wishes.

1:13:38.164 --> 1:13:42.501
He forgives me for all
that he knew I would do.

1:13:42.585 --> 1:13:44.252
But can I forgive myself?

1:13:45.713 --> 1:13:46.755
Forgive?

1:13:47.840 --> 1:13:49.966
I loved him, Louis.

1:13:50.760 --> 1:13:52.761
I love him still.

1:14:00.186 --> 1:14:02.270
Still?

1:14:02.355 --> 1:14:05.357
In pretending to love you,
I do something awful.

1:14:08.778 --> 1:14:10.654
You pretend?

1:14:14.992 --> 1:14:19.996
I have sinned
against love and God
for the sake of your mercy,

1:14:20.081 --> 1:14:23.667
which you would
not have given
without my sin.

1:14:23.751 --> 1:14:27.629
I will burn in hell.
So will you.

1:14:27.713 --> 1:14:29.881
