[music playing]

[screaming]

01:19.647 --> 01:22.147
Get out of the cage now!

01:22.149 --> 01:23.649
No!

01:23.651 --> 01:26.251
You just cross your
pretty legs, honey.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.187
We'll be right back.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.121
LOLA (SCREAMING): No!

01:42.836 --> 01:45.971
How am I supposed
to go down here?

01:45.973 --> 01:48.207
Like a dog.

01:48.209 --> 01:51.110
Is that what I am?

01:51.112 --> 01:53.545
A dog?

01:53.547 --> 01:54.880
A dog can be trained.

02:04.524 --> 02:05.958
Why are you so bad to me?

02:05.960 --> 02:08.060
It's cause you ain't no good.

02:08.062 --> 02:09.094
That's why.

02:09.096 --> 02:11.497
MARLO: You're wrong.

02:11.499 --> 02:13.899
I'm good at lots of things.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.300
MAMA: Hm, like what?

02:15.302 --> 02:17.903
Like stealing.

02:17.905 --> 02:22.174
But you ain't much for
getting away, now, are ya?

02:22.176 --> 02:23.609
Yeah.

02:23.611 --> 02:29.114
Scammin' and stealin' may
well be the crust of life.

02:29.116 --> 02:33.819
But there's only one meat
worth putting in that fire.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.855
And what's that?

02:36.857 --> 02:38.357
Well, love, of course.

02:55.675 --> 02:59.111

RADIO REPORTER (ON RADIO):
A dramatic scene today

04:56.697 --> 04:59.164
at the Beverly Hills home
of Emmy Award-winning actors

04:59.166 --> 05:00.666
Michael and Maria Franklin.

05:00.668 --> 05:04.136
Just hours ago, their
16-year-old daughter, Lola

05:04.138 --> 05:05.637
Franklin, was reported missing.

05:05.639 --> 05:09.074
Police are treating it as
a potential kidnapping.

05:09.076 --> 05:11.009
Details on her abduction
are still coming in.

05:11.011 --> 05:14.646
But here's what we can tell
you-- Lola Franklin, daughter

05:14.648 --> 05:17.282
of Emmy Award winning
actors Michael and Maria

05:17.284 --> 05:18.850
Franklin was taken
from her home sometime

05:18.852 --> 05:20.619
after 10:00 PM last night.

05:20.621 --> 05:24.056
And at 1:24 AM, she
made a distress call

05:24.058 --> 05:25.090
from her cell phone.

05:25.092 --> 05:27.225
Police are still not
sure where exactly

05:27.227 --> 05:28.927
that call was made from.

05:28.929 --> 05:31.863
But they are focusing the
investigation around her home

05:31.865 --> 05:34.299
and in the East
Los Angeles area.

05:38.237 --> 05:41.173
You have no idea
who I am, do you?

05:41.175 --> 05:43.975
No, ma'am.

05:43.977 --> 05:47.579
But you seem real nice.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.614
I'm sure it's all going
to work out for you.

07:21.507 --> 07:24.476
What's good?

07:24.478 --> 07:27.245
I'm generally partial to
eggs-- boiled or fried.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.680
Mostly boiled.

07:28.682 --> 07:29.981
I mean, who knows
what kind of drippy,

07:29.983 --> 07:31.149
poison body fat
was on that griddle

07:31.151 --> 07:32.551
before they even fry those eggs.

07:32.553 --> 07:36.188
You know what I mean?

07:36.190 --> 07:37.856
WAITRESS: What'll it be?

07:37.858 --> 07:39.825
I'll have four fried eggs.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.059
WAITRESS: What about
you, sweetheart?

07:41.061 --> 07:41.860
I'll take six.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.328
WAITRESS: Six fried eggs.

07:43.330 --> 07:44.663
Make that eight.

07:44.665 --> 07:45.597
WAITRESS: Eight fried eggs.

07:45.599 --> 07:46.364
Yes, ma'am.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.836
This is fun.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.838
TV REPORTER (ON TV): We have
breaking news on the kidnapping

07:52.840 --> 07:54.639
of Lola Franklin.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.341
Just minutes ago,
police released

07:56.343 --> 07:59.811
this recording of the terrified
teenager pleading for her life.

07:59.813 --> 08:04.115
A warning-- this may be
upsetting for some viewers.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.450
LOLA (ON TV): I don't
know where I am.

08:05.452 --> 08:06.485
I don't know where we're going.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.386
I don't what he wants.

08:08.388 --> 08:12.224
But please, help me.

08:12.226 --> 08:13.892
Faked your own kidnapping.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.160
Pretty good, right?

08:15.162 --> 08:16.428
My parents are actors.

08:16.430 --> 08:19.164
Why would you do that?

08:19.166 --> 08:21.433
They look like
nice people, right?

08:21.435 --> 08:23.602
My parents.

08:23.604 --> 08:24.703
But they're not.

08:24.705 --> 08:26.872
Their tears are fake.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.773
Seem pretty genuine to me.

08:28.775 --> 08:30.275
You don't recognize them?

08:35.047 --> 08:36.414
You know when there's
a natural disaster,

08:36.416 --> 08:38.183
and the TV has those
phone in and give

08:38.184 --> 08:40.284
money the victim things?

08:40.287 --> 08:41.119
Mm hm.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.254
And the celebrities come on.

08:42.256 --> 08:44.756
And they're all like,
give money and stop

08:44.758 --> 08:46.458
the suffering and the
starving of the children,

08:46.460 --> 08:48.059
blah, blah, blah, blah.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.461
Yeah.

08:49.463 --> 08:52.497
Have you ever noticed that the
football players are all cool?

08:52.499 --> 08:54.799
The actors are like
choking back tears.

08:54.801 --> 08:56.067
Have you ever noticed that?

08:56.069 --> 08:57.168
Yeah.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.537
Do you think it's cause
they're like really

08:58.539 --> 09:00.405
sensitive and emotional, and
the very thought of recording

09:00.407 --> 09:01.840
a video message about
shivering kiddies

09:01.842 --> 09:04.209
gets them all misty eyed
and broken up inside?

09:04.211 --> 09:06.111
Or do you think
it's because weeping

09:06.113 --> 09:10.348
in front of the camera's
part of their fucking job?

09:10.350 --> 09:11.283
See?

09:11.285 --> 09:12.717
They're all hugging and shit.

09:12.719 --> 09:15.020
They did the exact same
thing in "Cold Harbor."

09:15.022 --> 09:16.588
Episode Four, Season Three.

09:16.590 --> 09:17.522
Their kid went missing.

09:17.524 --> 09:19.391
And they did the
exact same thing.

09:19.393 --> 09:20.525
They're not even married.

09:20.527 --> 09:22.193
They haven't been
married for years.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.129
Ah.

09:24.131 --> 09:25.630
No.

09:25.632 --> 09:28.433
You think I'm upset because
my parents are divorced?

09:28.435 --> 09:30.402
Everyone's parents are divorced.

09:30.404 --> 09:31.803
You think there's
like a billion kids

09:31.805 --> 09:34.306
flopping around on the floor--
oh no, my parents are divorced,

09:34.308 --> 09:35.040
it's all my fault!

09:39.612 --> 09:42.247
It's because they're evil.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.215
Evil.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.618
Evil like what?

09:46.620 --> 09:49.254
Like outer space evil?

09:49.256 --> 09:51.590
Like vampire evil.

09:51.592 --> 09:54.159
Right.

09:54.161 --> 09:57.429
So that's why you ran away?

09:57.431 --> 10:00.332
Because they're vampires.

10:00.334 --> 10:01.266
Wouldn't you?

10:05.538 --> 10:07.405
I'll take those eggs to go.

10:07.407 --> 10:08.840
I'm coming with you.

10:17.283 --> 10:20.585
You know what you get
for kidnapping a minor?

10:20.587 --> 10:25.857
Doing sick and confusing
things to them?

10:25.859 --> 10:29.160
Things regular people wouldn't
even know how to spell.

10:29.162 --> 10:33.131
Do you know what
you get for that?

10:33.133 --> 10:35.266
You get your fucking
balls cut off, is what.

10:38.237 --> 10:42.407
Are you a bitter man?

10:42.409 --> 10:44.309
By night.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.411
Do you carry in your
heart a measure of dislike

10:46.413 --> 10:48.713
towards cute and furry animals?

10:48.715 --> 10:50.682
No ma'am.

10:50.684 --> 10:53.051
Well, I'm guessing
about seven seconds.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.285
Seven seconds?

10:54.287 --> 10:56.321
That's how long it will
take to convince the people

10:56.323 --> 10:58.590
in this diner that you're
a ruthless, dangerous

10:58.592 --> 11:00.759
kidnapper that has taken
my person, and likely

11:00.761 --> 11:01.726
my virginity.

11:01.728 --> 11:03.228
If they don't cut
your balls off,

11:03.230 --> 11:04.929
the two dozen state
troopers that come

11:04.931 --> 11:09.401
pouring in through this door
when called certainly will.

11:09.403 --> 11:11.169
So it's up to you.

11:11.171 --> 11:19.911
You can be a nutless,
kidnapping eunuch, or my hero.

11:19.913 --> 11:20.845
What's it gonna be?

11:23.649 --> 11:24.749
I like you.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.453
I know.

11:44.737 --> 11:46.237
So.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.306
What kind of trouble you in?

11:48.308 --> 11:50.775
Who said I'm in any trouble?

11:50.777 --> 11:51.676
Boy like you.

11:51.678 --> 11:53.011
Car like this.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.746
You're in trouble.

11:54.748 --> 11:58.016
Well, I guess it's sort
of a misunderstanding.

11:58.018 --> 12:01.486
I guess it must've been.

12:01.488 --> 12:02.454
Nice picture.

12:12.431 --> 12:13.898
That's pretty sneaky.

12:21.373 --> 12:23.875
You're a pickpocket.

12:23.877 --> 12:26.978
I'm a fingersmith.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.380
I like you.

12:29.382 --> 12:30.315
I know.

12:34.620 --> 12:36.054
So where you headed?

12:36.056 --> 12:37.322
Mobile, Alabama.

12:37.324 --> 12:38.123
Yeah?

12:38.125 --> 12:39.824
What's in Mobile, Alabama?

12:39.826 --> 12:41.292
All things good
that back then was,

12:41.294 --> 12:43.361
and everything's
that's yet to be.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.430
Yeah, well it
sounds like heaven.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.565
Don't it, though?

12:47.567 --> 12:49.734
1,200 miles.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.069
You got any money?

12:51.071 --> 12:53.304
I was planning on acquiring
the criminal version

12:53.306 --> 12:54.773
of invisibility.

12:54.775 --> 12:56.107
Honey, you tell
me why a Beverly

12:56.109 --> 12:58.710
Hills princess fakes
her own kidnapping,

12:58.712 --> 13:00.845
runs off into the desert.

13:00.847 --> 13:04.082
I'll teach you to shear the
gold from a judge's jaw bone.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.650
Fake?

13:05.652 --> 13:08.787
Lover, I escaped
the cold, stone,

13:08.789 --> 13:11.356
ghoulish clutches of an
undead vampire castle.

13:16.929 --> 13:18.596
Ah, you don't live in a castle.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.165
Like you've ever seen a castle.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.000
Well, does it
have a drawbridge?

13:22.002 --> 13:22.801
It's got guards.

13:22.803 --> 13:24.502
It's got towers.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.771
And vampires.

13:26.773 --> 13:28.606
Those vampires.

13:28.608 --> 13:31.042
My so-called parents.

13:31.044 --> 13:34.846
At night, they crawl out the
tower windows, down the castle

13:34.848 --> 13:37.515
wall, to the village below.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.851
There, they steal
through open windows

13:39.853 --> 13:43.955
to suck the blood from
babies and children.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.757
Night after night,
the ghouls return

13:45.759 --> 13:47.725
to feed on that same child.

13:47.727 --> 13:52.330
And that child begins
to pale and weaken.

13:52.332 --> 13:57.735
Are you trying to tell
me-- did your father--

13:57.737 --> 13:59.304
Molest me?

13:59.306 --> 14:01.739
If the man did that,
he wouldn't be undead.

14:01.741 --> 14:05.276
He'd be dead-dead.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.011
That, I believe.

14:07.013 --> 14:10.515
So you gonna share with me
your dark art of thievery?

14:10.517 --> 14:14.619
Not exactly a satisfactory
answer as to why you ran away.

14:14.621 --> 14:18.523
It's the only one
you're gonna get.

14:18.525 --> 14:19.991
Show me your hands.

14:22.494 --> 14:23.361
Oh, you got stubby fingers.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.701
I'm close to positive it's
not a no you want to say to me.

14:42.281 --> 14:44.048
First thing to understand
is that fingersmithing

14:44.050 --> 14:48.486
involves no weapons, no
violence, no long-term effects

14:48.488 --> 14:50.421
on the mark.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.557
Take only wallets and purses.

14:52.559 --> 14:55.894
We only take them from those
who can afford to lose them.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.729
Now, what do you see?

14:57.731 --> 15:00.632
I see a couple of pickpockets
standing under a "Beware

15:00.634 --> 15:02.100
of Pickpockets" sign.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.969
That's the whole point,
is they see the sign.

15:04.971 --> 15:09.007
Then their heart catches a
beat-- where's my wallet,

15:09.009 --> 15:10.141
they think.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.377
And as they think it,
their hand instinctively

15:12.379 --> 15:13.144
goes to their money.

15:20.519 --> 15:23.421
Cool.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.356
It's practically an invitation.

15:28.327 --> 15:29.928
OK, so now you have your mark.

15:29.930 --> 15:31.596
You know where the money is.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.398
LOLA: How do we get it?

15:33.400 --> 15:35.199
Operating on your
own is trickier.

15:35.201 --> 15:36.834
But with two, the simplest
version is a sandwich.

15:36.836 --> 15:39.637
LOLA: A sandwich?

15:39.639 --> 15:40.805
We're the bread.

15:40.807 --> 15:43.341
And the mark-- well
, he's the turkey.

15:48.113 --> 15:54.218
Just like any sandwich, you have
two bits of bread-- one behind

15:54.220 --> 15:55.853
and one in front.

15:55.855 --> 15:56.654
Pick and a stall.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.323
The one in front's a stall.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.358
The one behind's a pick.

16:00.360 --> 16:03.728
All the stall has to do
is stall so that-- then

16:03.730 --> 16:05.229
the pick bumps into the mark.

16:05.231 --> 16:06.731
Oh, beg your pardon.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.132
Not at all.

16:13.005 --> 16:15.673
That bump allows for
believable contact.

16:15.675 --> 16:20.211
And in that contact, the lifting
of the wallet is concealed.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.879
It's magic!

16:21.881 --> 16:22.680
Nah, just genius.

16:32.992 --> 16:33.725
Mister?

16:44.103 --> 16:44.869
I'm sorry.

16:47.806 --> 16:49.907
Man gotta have a code.

17:12.231 --> 17:13.698
So.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.866
This misunderstanding.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.134
Yeah?

17:16.136 --> 17:17.935
Has it got something to do
with the unsolicited years

17:17.936 --> 17:19.771
of your spirit fingers?

17:19.772 --> 17:21.672
It does.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.141
What did you steal?

17:23.143 --> 17:25.108
Just a kiss.

17:25.111 --> 17:26.544
And for that you're on the run?

17:26.546 --> 17:29.280
I'm a good kisser.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.816
Maybe you can deliver a kiss
worthy of interstate pursuit.

17:31.818 --> 17:34.652
But you're a terrible liar.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.888
I don't know what
it is you did steal.

17:36.890 --> 17:40.058
But a baby's sweet
nothing, it was not.

17:55.174 --> 17:57.175
Stop!

17:57.177 --> 17:58.609
Tell me you love me.

17:58.611 --> 17:59.710
Tell you?

17:59.712 --> 18:02.847
I'm gonna show you.

18:02.849 --> 18:05.216
Tell me.

18:05.218 --> 18:08.786
Well, I love you
like a bad disease.

18:08.788 --> 18:11.055
Like a death star,
plane crash fireball.

18:14.026 --> 18:14.792
Show me.

18:36.315 --> 18:38.516
What's your name?

18:38.518 --> 18:39.250
Marlo.

18:41.987 --> 18:42.753
Marlo.

18:45.757 --> 18:50.128
I want to gouge your
fucking eyes out.

18:50.130 --> 18:51.596
I want to bite your face off.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.035
I believe if we
concentrate our powers we

18:58.037 --> 18:59.137
can make ourselves invisible.

19:02.341 --> 19:04.909
I believe every cop they got's
out there looking for you.

19:08.247 --> 19:11.983
They're not going
to find me, are they?

19:11.985 --> 19:13.017
Why'd you run away?

19:15.888 --> 19:19.223
They're not going to find me.

19:19.225 --> 19:22.927
They're not going to
take me back, are they?

19:22.929 --> 19:24.195
No.

19:24.197 --> 19:24.962
Never.

21:19.044 --> 21:20.244
Where did you go?

21:34.926 --> 21:37.361
What about him?

21:37.363 --> 21:38.763
Not with those boots.

21:41.800 --> 21:42.733
Ooh, maybe her.

21:45.771 --> 21:47.271
Only poor people
use pay phones.

23:14.459 --> 23:16.193
This was back in
the 50s, back when

23:16.195 --> 23:19.563
Vegas was Sinatra and
gangsters and the atomic bomb.

23:19.565 --> 23:22.233
Clubs used to throw these
all night A-bomb parties.

23:22.235 --> 23:23.901
And in the morning, they'd
all go out on the deck,

23:23.903 --> 23:25.803
put on the dark glasses,
and watch the A-bomb test

23:25.805 --> 23:27.872
like it was the 4th of July.

23:27.874 --> 23:33.210
The Vegas of today-- the strip--
couldn't hold a candle to it.

23:33.212 --> 23:34.845
So it was at one of
these A-bomb parties

23:34.847 --> 23:36.247
that the robbery occurred.

23:36.249 --> 23:39.550
Now, when she realized that her
diamonds were missing-- well,

23:39.552 --> 23:43.020
she was very upset.

23:43.022 --> 23:44.855
So the owner, he
bars up the doors.

23:44.857 --> 23:46.424
And they search
everybody in the joint.

23:46.426 --> 23:47.792
Now, unfortunately,
the perpatrator--

23:47.794 --> 23:51.195
the only thing missing, apart
from the necklace, was him.

23:51.197 --> 23:53.631
[CONTINUES TALKING IN
BACKGROUND]

24:37.809 --> 24:40.744
It's the last great buried
treasure in America.

24:44.749 --> 24:47.184
[inaudible] and $10 million
in diamonds and pearls.

24:52.691 --> 24:55.159
You!

24:55.161 --> 24:56.660
Who are you?

24:56.662 --> 24:57.728
Who the hell are you?

24:57.730 --> 24:59.730
I'm Jeff.

24:59.732 --> 25:01.098
Are you a cop?

25:01.100 --> 25:02.900
Are you a police officer?

25:02.902 --> 25:03.701
No.

25:03.703 --> 25:07.438
I--I--I--I--I'm Jeff.

25:07.440 --> 25:10.074
What the fuck are
you doing here?

25:10.076 --> 25:12.142
We just came to get ice cream.

25:17.249 --> 25:21.085
Uh, darlin'--

25:21.087 --> 25:25.556
Guy in the back, get out here.

25:25.558 --> 25:27.057
Everybody put your arms down.

25:27.059 --> 25:29.293
Put your arms down.

25:29.295 --> 25:31.228
Baby, get the money.

25:31.230 --> 25:32.363
Excuse me?

25:32.365 --> 25:34.131
Come on, baby.
Get the money from the register.

25:34.133 --> 25:34.899
Let's go.

25:46.578 --> 25:48.579
Lola!

25:48.581 --> 25:50.447
Lola, get back in here!

25:50.449 --> 25:51.815
What the hell are you
doing with my life?

25:51.817 --> 25:53.717
I'm so hot for you right now.

25:53.719 --> 25:54.485
What?

25:58.023 --> 26:00.491
Christ!

26:00.493 --> 26:01.692
Just stay there!

26:01.694 --> 26:02.493
Stay there!

26:02.495 --> 26:03.961
Stay!

26:03.963 --> 26:04.962
What I do takes style.

26:04.964 --> 26:06.964
It takes subtlety.

26:06.966 --> 26:09.934
[inaudible] Lola.

26:09.936 --> 26:13.404
You're out there auditioning
for America's Most Wanted!

26:13.406 --> 26:14.872
LOLA: God, you're such a baby.

26:18.376 --> 26:21.879
Lola, you are, without
a doubt the craziest,

26:21.881 --> 26:25.816
the most dangerous,
worse time 10

26:25.818 --> 26:30.588
version of a bad
idea I ever had.

26:30.590 --> 26:32.690
Well, I guess I
love you, too, baby.

26:52.877 --> 26:53.644
Who's that?

27:04.923 --> 27:06.357
MARLO: That's Mama.

27:10.762 --> 27:11.895
Aren't you going
to introduce us?

27:11.897 --> 27:13.564
No.
Well, I would.

27:13.566 --> 27:18.035
But me and Mama, we had
that misunderstanding.

27:18.037 --> 27:20.404
What kind of misunderstanding?

27:20.406 --> 27:21.205
The unresolved kind.

27:28.680 --> 27:30.114
[screaming]

27:31.149 --> 27:34.051
You see what you made me do?

27:34.053 --> 27:36.286
Do you see?

27:36.288 --> 27:39.590
Do you see how your
mama loves you?

27:39.592 --> 27:41.025
What's going on, baby?

27:41.027 --> 27:42.493
I swear to you, I'll
tell you everything.

27:42.495 --> 27:44.528
Right now, I need you
to get the fucking bags.

27:44.530 --> 27:46.130
We gotta go.

27:46.132 --> 27:47.731
We gotta go.

27:47.733 --> 27:49.199
Don't you see?

28:44.122 --> 28:45.122
Right.

28:45.124 --> 28:46.557
There's a church.

28:56.101 --> 28:57.234
Did it come out?
-What?

28:57.236 --> 28:58.035
The bullet.

28:58.037 --> 28:58.869
Did it come out?

28:58.871 --> 29:00.137
I--I don't know.

29:00.139 --> 29:01.939
Get down here, Lola.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.540
Get down here!

29:03.542 --> 29:05.676
Just check.

29:05.678 --> 29:06.677
There's no hole.

29:06.679 --> 29:07.644
There's no hole.

29:07.646 --> 29:09.146
You gotta get it out.

29:09.148 --> 29:10.547
I gotta get a doctor.

29:10.549 --> 29:11.348
No no no no no.

29:11.350 --> 29:12.549
She'll find us.

29:12.551 --> 29:14.752
I know you can do this, baby.

29:14.754 --> 29:15.719
No, I know it.

29:15.721 --> 29:17.755
I know that you can.

29:17.757 --> 29:19.022
I know it.

29:25.096 --> 29:26.029
Five minutes.

29:35.573 --> 29:36.340
God!

29:44.182 --> 29:46.049
I love you.

29:46.051 --> 29:48.519
I love you.

29:48.521 --> 29:49.586
Do it.

29:49.588 --> 29:51.288
Do it.

29:51.290 --> 29:52.089
Do it.

30:01.966 --> 30:03.433
I can feel it!

30:11.843 --> 30:14.812
Hush, you!

30:14.814 --> 30:15.579
Come on!

30:25.490 --> 30:26.924
I am awesome.

30:49.314 --> 30:50.314
Mama shot me.

30:55.053 --> 30:56.486
Wedding's gonna
be a barn burner.

31:53.077 --> 31:55.045
Is she your real mama?

31:55.047 --> 31:57.281
Well, I can't claim to
be a reliable witness

31:57.283 --> 32:03.153
to my own birth, which I'm
pretty sure is a good thing.

32:03.155 --> 32:03.921
But she raised you.

32:08.192 --> 32:08.959
Now, in a way she did.

33:07.118 --> 33:10.821
He's a gentle soul,
that son of mine.

33:10.823 --> 33:13.256
You should have borrowed
that money from him.

33:19.197 --> 33:21.431
And that's why she shot you?

33:21.433 --> 33:23.300
Because you saw her?

33:23.302 --> 33:24.968
Not exactly.

33:24.970 --> 33:28.038
What I am is on the
run from my own mama.

33:28.040 --> 33:30.307
Direct result of me stealing
from her a duffel bag

33:30.309 --> 33:33.343
full of cash, tossing it off a
building to a crowd in a kind

33:33.345 --> 33:35.579
of Robin Hood kind of gesture.

33:35.581 --> 33:38.648
A million dollars?

33:38.650 --> 33:40.250
And change.

33:40.252 --> 33:42.119
[inaudible]?

33:42.121 --> 33:43.520
I was very upset.

33:52.897 --> 33:53.663
I'm not scared of her.

33:56.534 --> 33:57.401
Let her come.

34:42.513 --> 34:43.947
REPORTER (ON TV): Emmy
Award-winning actors,

34:43.949 --> 34:45.181
Michael and Maria Franklin.

34:45.184 --> 34:46.283
MICHAEL FRANKLIN
(ON TV): Whoever

34:46.284 --> 34:48.150
you are that took
our daughter away,

34:48.152 --> 34:49.518
you will pay for what you did.

34:49.521 --> 34:51.254
MARIA FRANKLIN (ON
TV): We want her back.

34:51.255 --> 34:55.391
And to anyone who returns
her to us safe and sound,

34:55.393 --> 35:00.263
we're offering a
reward of $1 million.

35:00.265 --> 35:02.699
I got these tacos from this
couple on the side of the road.

35:02.701 --> 35:05.335
I swear they must be like a
thousand and three years old.

35:05.337 --> 35:06.503
And they got this
TV hooked up to

35:06.505 --> 35:07.904
this donkey-powered generator.

35:07.906 --> 35:10.240
And they just sit there all day
watching Mexican soap operas,

35:10.242 --> 35:12.175
being really happy.

35:12.177 --> 35:13.009
How is that even possible?

35:18.182 --> 35:18.949
Why'd you run away?

35:21.752 --> 35:22.719
I was kidnapped.

35:22.721 --> 35:23.487
Lola.

35:26.224 --> 35:27.023
I told you.

35:27.025 --> 35:27.858
My parents are werewolves.

35:31.662 --> 35:34.464
You said vampires.

35:34.466 --> 35:35.599
No, they're werewolves.

35:42.540 --> 35:43.874
MICHAEL FRANKLIN (ON
TV): You know what?

35:43.876 --> 35:45.108
That's a matter for the police.

35:45.110 --> 35:46.743
It's not our concern.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.044
This is a cash offer.

35:48.046 --> 35:49.246
No questions asked.

35:49.248 --> 35:52.616
$1 million for the safe
return of our daughter.

35:52.618 --> 35:53.850
Why'd you run away?

35:56.754 --> 35:58.088
I saved your life.

35:58.090 --> 35:59.623
And now you want to cash me in?

35:59.625 --> 36:00.423
You're selling me?

36:00.425 --> 36:01.224
I want to protect you.

36:01.226 --> 36:02.325
By sending me back?

36:02.327 --> 36:03.426
By taking you somewhere safe.

36:03.428 --> 36:04.461
They're monsters!

36:04.463 --> 36:05.762
They're your parents.

36:05.764 --> 36:08.398
And since they're clearly
not werewolves or vampires,

36:08.400 --> 36:10.567
and they're not molesting
you or abusing you,

36:10.569 --> 36:12.402
then it's a whole lot
safer than being with me.

36:12.404 --> 36:15.705
So you're selling me?

36:15.707 --> 36:18.074
You think I want to do this?

36:18.076 --> 36:20.377
I don't pay off
Mama, I'm a dead man.

36:20.379 --> 36:22.913
And if you're with me when
she finds me, you're dead too.

36:22.915 --> 36:24.080
I was with you.

36:24.082 --> 36:25.715
I'm the reason you're alive.

36:25.717 --> 36:27.317
It's the right thing to do.

36:27.319 --> 36:29.986
What the fuck do you know
about the right thing to do?

36:29.988 --> 36:30.820
You're a thief.

36:30.822 --> 36:31.621
You're a liar.

36:31.623 --> 36:32.689
You're a coward.

36:32.691 --> 36:33.890
I love you.

36:33.892 --> 36:34.858
Fuck you.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.059
I'm sorry.

36:36.061 --> 36:37.027
Fuck you.

36:37.029 --> 36:37.827
Fight back!

36:37.829 --> 36:38.828
I love you, Lola.

36:38.830 --> 36:40.997
Stop saying that!

36:40.999 --> 36:42.766
But I'm taking you back.

36:56.080 --> 36:59.916
I'll give you five
seconds to call this off.

36:59.918 --> 37:00.884
No chance.

37:08.359 --> 37:11.027
Four, three, two--

37:11.029 --> 37:12.329
Lola.
---One.

37:12.331 --> 37:13.496
Done.
Help!

37:13.498 --> 37:14.297
Help!

37:14.299 --> 37:15.298
Kidnap!

37:15.300 --> 37:17.300
Kidnap!

37:17.302 --> 37:19.269
Help!

37:19.271 --> 37:20.770
Kidnap!

37:20.772 --> 37:22.239
Kidnap!

37:22.241 --> 37:23.740
Help!

37:23.742 --> 37:25.208
Help!

37:25.210 --> 37:26.176
Help me!

37:31.182 --> 37:32.849
Of course she was a captive.

37:32.851 --> 37:33.650
Everyone saw that.

37:33.652 --> 37:34.651
But she didn't seem scared.

37:34.653 --> 37:35.652
No.

37:35.654 --> 37:38.088
She seemed angry,
but not scared.

37:42.093 --> 37:43.526
So this is the honeymoon?

37:47.031 --> 37:48.498
What are you doing?

37:52.069 --> 37:53.336
MICHAEL FRANKLIN
(ON PHONE): Lola?

37:53.338 --> 37:55.538
Mr. Franklin, my name is Marlo.

37:55.540 --> 37:57.040
I'm the guy that didn't
kidnap your daughter.

37:57.042 --> 37:58.408
MICHAEL FRANKLIN (ON
PHONE): Mr. Marlo,

37:58.410 --> 38:00.577
there are billions of people
that didn't kidnap my daughter.

38:00.579 --> 38:02.679
But the man who calls
me from her cell phone

38:02.681 --> 38:03.613
is not likely one of them.

38:03.615 --> 38:04.914
Nobody kidnapped
her, Mr. Franklin.

38:04.916 --> 38:06.650
She ran away.

38:06.652 --> 38:08.018
I'm calling because
I'm bringing her home.

38:08.020 --> 38:09.786
And I wouldn't want to be
mistaken for a kidnapper.

38:09.788 --> 38:13.123
MICHAEL FRANKLIN (ON PHONE):
Are you around 18 years old?

38:13.125 --> 38:14.291
Yes.

38:14.293 --> 38:15.992
MICHAEL FRANKLIN (ON
PHONE): 5'10", dark hair?

38:15.994 --> 38:16.960
Yep.

38:16.962 --> 38:18.128
MICHAEL FRANKLIN
(ON PHONE): Did you

38:18.130 --> 38:19.396
drag my daughter handcuffed
through a wedding

38:19.398 --> 38:20.964
and into a stolen car?

38:20.966 --> 38:21.998
Well, I did, but it was--

38:22.000 --> 38:23.133
MICHAEL FRANKLIN (ON
PHONE): Kidnapper.

38:23.135 --> 38:24.734
No, it was just to bring
her home, Mr. Franklin.

38:24.736 --> 38:25.935
She's a runaway.

38:25.937 --> 38:27.304
MICHAEL FRANKLIN (ON
PHONE): Let me speak to her.

38:30.274 --> 38:31.741
You're on speaker.

38:31.743 --> 38:33.743
She's sitting right next to me.

38:33.745 --> 38:34.878
MICHAEL FRANKLIN
(ON PHONE): Lola.

38:34.880 --> 38:37.013
Lola, honey, are you OK?

38:37.015 --> 38:38.181
Lola.

38:38.183 --> 38:39.482
MICHAEL FRANKLIN (ON
PHONE): Lola, speak to me.

38:39.484 --> 38:40.250
Lola!

38:44.155 --> 38:48.058
I-- [whispers] I'm
sorry, Mr. Franklin.

38:48.060 --> 38:49.426
She's not talking.

38:49.428 --> 38:50.560
MICHAEL FRANKLIN (ON PHONE):
If this is some kind of prank,

38:50.562 --> 38:51.661
I assure you--
-It's not a prank, Mr. Franklin.

38:51.663 --> 38:54.964
She's just in a bad mood.

38:54.966 --> 38:56.232
MICHAEL FRANKLIN (ON
PHONE): Bad mood?

38:56.234 --> 38:58.134
What kind of fool
do you think I am?

38:58.136 --> 38:59.569
Mr. Franklin, let me
send you a picture.

38:59.571 --> 39:03.006
I'll take a photo of Lola and
send it to you right away.

39:03.008 --> 39:03.940
OK?

39:03.942 --> 39:05.008
MICHAEL FRANKLIN
(ON PHONE): Do it.

39:09.580 --> 39:10.380
All right, smile.

39:15.252 --> 39:16.486
Nice.

39:16.488 --> 39:18.288
No, real, real nice.

39:18.290 --> 39:19.356
Come here!

39:19.358 --> 39:20.123
Get!

39:28.099 --> 39:30.800
You know what you just did?

39:30.802 --> 39:34.104
You just put a big
goddamn target on my head.

39:34.106 --> 39:35.038
Whoops.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.906
Now, listen, sweetheart.

39:36.908 --> 39:40.610
Now, between Mama, the cops,
the state troopers, the FBI--

39:40.612 --> 39:43.079
I think they got killing
me down pretty good.

39:43.081 --> 39:45.248
They don't need
any help from you.

39:45.250 --> 39:46.649
I told you I didn't
want to go back.

39:46.651 --> 39:49.786
And I told you every second
you spend with me is one second

39:49.788 --> 39:51.821
closer to you getting
caught and killed

39:51.823 --> 39:54.190
by a crazy-ass bitch
with a thing for dead man

39:54.192 --> 39:55.058
pussy licking.

39:55.060 --> 39:56.159
It's no way to live.

39:56.161 --> 39:58.194
And it's sure as shit
ain't no way to die.

39:58.196 --> 40:00.597
Now, you're going back
to the lap of luxury.

40:00.599 --> 40:02.298
I'm going to pay off Mama.

40:02.300 --> 40:04.534
Nobody's gonna get killed!

40:04.536 --> 40:06.903
Anytime any part of that
sounds like a bad idea,

40:06.905 --> 40:08.505
you just let me know.

40:38.903 --> 40:40.437
Do me a favor.

40:40.439 --> 40:43.907
Try to contain your
cinematic fantasies.

40:43.909 --> 40:47.010
Don't do anything that's
gonna get us killed.

40:47.012 --> 40:49.412
I would have done
anything for you.

40:52.383 --> 40:53.316
I know.

40:59.723 --> 41:03.927
10 fingers against
the dash, please, sir.

41:03.929 --> 41:07.330
Please, now is it?

41:07.332 --> 41:10.633
Any one of them
moves, it will be nine.

41:14.738 --> 41:17.006
Are you Lola Franklin?

41:17.008 --> 41:17.774
No.

41:23.147 --> 41:23.913
Out of the car.

41:45.069 --> 41:51.341
I'm going to push your face
into the hood of the car here.

41:51.343 --> 41:56.412
But I want you to know
there's no malice in it.

41:56.414 --> 41:57.180
Safety first.

42:01.685 --> 42:04.187
Everything's all
right, Ms. Franklin.

42:04.189 --> 42:06.422
It's all over.

42:06.424 --> 42:07.757
You're safe.

42:07.759 --> 42:10.994
However flattering it is or
isn't to be mistaken as Lola

42:10.996 --> 42:14.264
Franklin, the stars in
your eyes have caused

42:14.266 --> 42:15.798
you to make a secondary error.

42:20.838 --> 42:21.771
Oh, shit!

42:25.309 --> 42:26.309
Oh, sh--what the fuck?

42:26.311 --> 42:27.076
Gotcha.

42:49.733 --> 42:52.235
I'm sorry about that, officer.

42:52.237 --> 42:54.437
But please believe my
sole and goodly purpose

42:54.439 --> 42:57.140
is to return Lola,
here, safe and whole

42:57.142 --> 42:58.741
to her parents warm embrace.

42:58.743 --> 43:04.681
I'm sure you understand that's
difficult for me to believe.

43:04.683 --> 43:08.885
Truth is, I never thought it'd
be quite so difficult to do

43:08.887 --> 43:10.119
the right thing.

43:10.121 --> 43:11.888
COP: First time?

43:11.890 --> 43:14.490
No, but I sure
hope it's the last.

43:14.492 --> 43:17.827
And do you imagine
that in addition

43:17.829 --> 43:19.329
to the courage of
your convictions,

43:19.331 --> 43:24.233
you possess the means
to see them through?

43:24.235 --> 43:26.536
Well, I bested you, sir.

43:26.538 --> 43:28.404
LOLA: I'm not going back.

43:33.210 --> 43:36.946
Not something you often
hear from a kidnap victim.

43:36.948 --> 43:39.148
True enough.

43:39.150 --> 43:41.050
Well, if you could relate
that to your law enforcement

43:41.052 --> 43:44.754
colleagues, I'd be grateful.

43:44.756 --> 43:47.991
Situation of this
complexity is best

43:47.993 --> 43:52.128
explained by you in person.

44:00.337 --> 44:04.907
Well, as entertaining as arrest
and incarceration would be,

44:04.909 --> 44:06.175
I'm afraid I must decline.

44:10.214 --> 44:11.714
Thank you for not shooting me.

44:19.523 --> 44:21.524
I hope my eluding your
policing in this way

44:21.526 --> 44:25.061
has not caused you any
professional embarrassment.

44:25.063 --> 44:29.198
Oh, I'm sure any
persecution I might face

44:29.200 --> 44:33.336
will be more than
compensated for by the memory

44:33.338 --> 44:38.307
of our delightful conversation.

44:38.309 --> 44:42.345
Well it's always a pleasure
to meet a gentleman.

44:47.918 --> 44:48.685
Hey, fella?

44:52.189 --> 44:55.792
Should information come
to me that contradicts

44:55.794 --> 44:59.529
the honorable sentiments
that you have displayed

44:59.531 --> 45:06.369
in relation to Ms.
Franklin, I'll pour gasoline

45:06.371 --> 45:09.305
on you, set you on fire.

45:42.940 --> 45:43.740
What?

45:43.742 --> 45:44.741
Alabama.

45:44.743 --> 45:46.075
No chance.

45:46.077 --> 45:47.944
I helped you.

45:47.946 --> 45:49.011
I helped you back.

45:49.013 --> 45:49.812
I'll escape.

45:49.814 --> 45:50.713
I'll catch you.

45:50.715 --> 45:51.647
I'll kill you.

45:56.019 --> 45:58.287
We need a new car.

45:58.289 --> 45:59.689
REPORTER (ON TV):
Remarkable images

45:59.691 --> 46:01.858
today of the kidnapped teenager,
Lola Franklin, the daughter--

46:01.860 --> 46:03.226
REPORTER (ON TV): The
kidnapper seen here

46:03.228 --> 46:04.193
has not yet been identified--

46:04.195 --> 46:13.002
[interposing voices]

46:18.408 --> 46:20.276
We shouldn't steal
from these people.

46:20.278 --> 46:21.043
Nobody's here.

46:23.580 --> 46:25.014
It's the perfect
people to steal from.

46:45.502 --> 46:47.937
LOLA: Have you ever
been to Alabama?

46:47.939 --> 46:51.374
MARLO: Have you ever seen your
mother blow a guy's brains out?

46:51.376 --> 46:54.110
LOLA: You don't know my mother.

46:54.112 --> 46:57.146
MARLO: No, but you know mine.

46:57.148 --> 46:58.948
LOLA: I know you're
running from her.

46:58.950 --> 47:01.184
MARLO: Not for much longer.

47:01.186 --> 47:03.452
LOLA: Courage is not
the absence of fear.

47:03.454 --> 47:08.491
MARLO: And love is not
a license for suicide.

47:08.493 --> 47:09.458
LOLA: Of course it is.

47:21.872 --> 47:25.374
What do you think?

47:25.376 --> 47:26.876
I think that you're scared.

47:53.804 --> 47:56.772
Goddamn it!

47:56.774 --> 47:59.275
Goddamn it.

47:59.277 --> 48:01.110
Who the hell are you?

48:01.112 --> 48:03.045
Nobody.

48:03.047 --> 48:04.981
What do you want?

48:04.983 --> 48:07.383
Nothing.

48:07.385 --> 48:09.952
[inaudible], it's all yours.

48:09.954 --> 48:14.357
Sir, um, what are you doing?

48:14.359 --> 48:15.558
She serious?

48:15.560 --> 48:16.759
She's very nurturing.

48:16.761 --> 48:18.594
I mean why are you doing it?

48:21.365 --> 48:23.165
May have escaped
your direct attention.

48:23.167 --> 48:25.735
I've moved beyond the why.

48:25.737 --> 48:27.169
I'm well into the how.

48:27.171 --> 48:28.437
What's your name?

48:28.439 --> 48:29.505
That's none of your business.

48:29.507 --> 48:30.306
LOLA: Please.

48:30.308 --> 48:32.508
I'm just trying to help.

48:32.510 --> 48:33.342
You want to help?

48:33.344 --> 48:36.913
You get me a bigger box.

48:36.915 --> 48:37.680
Marlo, fetch me a box.

49:07.477 --> 49:08.978
Now.

49:08.980 --> 49:10.146
What's your name?

49:10.148 --> 49:12.048
I'll tell you my name,
you give me that box.

49:12.050 --> 49:13.582
I give you the box,
you give me a stream

49:13.584 --> 49:14.583
of piss running down your leg.

49:14.585 --> 49:15.952
Sounds like a no.

49:15.954 --> 49:17.586
Normally I'm not the kind of
girl to fish for compliments.

49:17.588 --> 49:20.990
But I'm pretty sure we're
saving your life here.

49:20.992 --> 49:22.825
I wouldn't be doing that.

49:22.827 --> 49:24.660
Why?

49:24.662 --> 49:26.128
I'm a very bad man.

49:31.635 --> 49:35.671
I was born in nineteen
hundred and sixty.

49:35.673 --> 49:37.506
Or '61.

49:37.508 --> 49:40.676
Can't be sure of the date.

49:40.678 --> 49:43.245
Place was where we sit.

49:43.247 --> 49:45.247
[inaudible] my
mama pushed me out

49:45.249 --> 49:48.117
and my daddy caught me
before I hit the dirt.

49:50.854 --> 49:52.488
He was a prospector.

49:52.490 --> 49:55.491
Little success and less cheer.

49:58.128 --> 50:02.498
My presence in the world did
nothing to improve his luck.

50:02.500 --> 50:05.801
He was a god-fearing
man, my daddy.

50:05.803 --> 50:10.239
For all his bible learning,
he did one irretrievable evil.

50:12.909 --> 50:16.212
The man put into me a lust
for gold would make Cortez

50:16.214 --> 50:17.913
and the rape of
the new world seem

50:17.915 --> 50:19.015
an afternoon perambulation.

50:27.824 --> 50:30.326
Gold.

50:30.328 --> 50:31.660
There was a time the
word itself would,

50:31.662 --> 50:34.764
with the will in me so strong--
the self-abuse would last

50:34.766 --> 50:37.566
from sundown to cock's crow.

50:37.568 --> 50:39.835
Truth is, there was never
enough gold in these hills

50:39.837 --> 50:41.137
to fill the teeth of 10 men.

50:44.107 --> 50:48.978
20 years of hardscrabble did
nothing to teach me better.

50:48.980 --> 50:50.146
Or was it 30 years?

50:53.450 --> 50:54.216
Or 40?

50:56.987 --> 50:59.321
My whole life, I prayed
to the golden god.

51:02.025 --> 51:06.295
I worshipped and I sacrificed.

51:06.297 --> 51:09.598
Every day I woke with
the true belief--

51:09.600 --> 51:13.035
the true belief--
that this would

51:13.037 --> 51:17.373
be the day to find the
nugget would change my life.

51:17.375 --> 51:21.877
I woke this morning and
my faith was broken.

51:26.083 --> 51:28.717
And with no faith in the dream,
got no place in the world.

51:31.488 --> 51:33.422
LOLA: That doesn't
make you a bad man.

51:37.928 --> 51:39.595
No.

51:39.597 --> 51:40.362
No.

51:43.900 --> 51:44.834
This might.

51:48.872 --> 51:51.707
You have a gun?

51:51.709 --> 51:53.576
Now, why didn't you
just shoot yourself?

51:53.578 --> 51:55.945
Shut up.

51:55.947 --> 51:58.180
Fear not, ma'am.

51:58.182 --> 52:00.716
Your ordeal of captivity and
deprivation is at an end.

52:00.718 --> 52:01.517
Oh my god.

52:01.519 --> 52:02.485
MARLO: Listen, buddy--

52:02.487 --> 52:04.753
Shut up, you
villainous desecrator.

52:04.755 --> 52:05.688
You know who I am.

52:05.690 --> 52:09.592
Yes, ma'am, I do.

52:09.594 --> 52:10.793
What are your intentions?

52:10.795 --> 52:11.794
My intentions?

52:11.796 --> 52:12.761
Your Intentions.

52:12.763 --> 52:14.096
What are they?

52:14.098 --> 52:16.899
I'm going to rescue you from
the clutches of your captor,

52:16.901 --> 52:19.702
and return you safe and whole
to the bosom of your family.

52:19.704 --> 52:20.803
And collect the reward?

52:20.805 --> 52:23.439
A lifetime of trial
and testing of my faith.

52:23.441 --> 52:25.641
I seen the lord of
the yellow rock.

52:25.643 --> 52:28.577
Lay a $1 million nugget at my
feet, I'll take it with thanks.

52:28.579 --> 52:30.446
Yes, ma'am.

52:30.448 --> 52:33.682
I won't go.

52:33.684 --> 52:34.617
What?

52:34.619 --> 52:36.252
I have no wish to,
and no intention

52:36.254 --> 52:37.386
of returning to my family.

52:37.388 --> 52:39.622
A child should be
with their parents.

52:39.624 --> 52:41.190
And where should
be the kidnapper?

52:41.192 --> 52:42.591
Because if you attempt
to take me hence,

52:42.593 --> 52:43.759
that's what you will be.

52:43.761 --> 52:44.527
Kidnapper.

52:47.464 --> 52:49.598
There's a legal reward.

52:49.600 --> 52:51.167
The reward for
kidnapping a child

52:51.169 --> 52:54.470
can be no less than the
eternal flames of damnation.

52:54.472 --> 52:57.540
For those who worship
the yellow rock,

52:57.542 --> 53:01.443
there is no hell like
life without coin.

53:01.445 --> 53:03.879
I do not know, nor
do I much care, why

53:03.881 --> 53:05.214
you do not wish to return home.

53:05.216 --> 53:06.549
But home is where you're going.

53:09.686 --> 53:11.620
Just what to do with this
sinner, I can't decide.

53:11.622 --> 53:13.422
Hey, you can give
me the reward.

53:13.424 --> 53:15.824
You give me a good reason not
to put you under the ground

53:15.826 --> 53:17.393
right now.

53:17.395 --> 53:19.762
Well, I did deliver
Lola to your doorstep.

53:19.764 --> 53:23.365
The holy golden nugget you spent
your whole life looking for.

53:23.367 --> 53:24.633
I call that reason enough.

53:24.635 --> 53:26.135
But if you need more,
you might remember

53:26.137 --> 53:28.204
I did it when you lay
low with loss of faith,

53:28.206 --> 53:29.972
and looking to
stretch your own neck.

53:29.974 --> 53:32.107
I won't deny you a
party to the events

53:32.109 --> 53:34.843
that kept me from the rope.

53:34.845 --> 53:39.415
But my clear memory of your
role was not as my savior,

53:39.417 --> 53:42.518
but to liberally
encouragize my mortal folly.

53:42.520 --> 53:44.853
I remember you asking
for direct assistance

53:44.855 --> 53:45.688
in that department.

53:45.690 --> 53:47.823
JED: I took leave of my senses.

53:47.825 --> 53:48.891
And now?

53:48.893 --> 53:50.793
All of my faculties
have returned to me.

53:50.795 --> 53:53.495
MARLO: Then task your mind
with the following question--

53:53.497 --> 53:55.197
how many George
Foreman lean mean

53:55.199 --> 53:58.067
fat reducing grilling machines
can you get for this nugget?

53:58.069 --> 53:59.668
How many Ab [inaudible] Pros.

53:59.670 --> 54:02.304
How many limited edition
Hoover Dam commemorative coins

54:02.306 --> 54:03.839
can you buy with
a million dollars?

54:03.841 --> 54:05.207
Now, you ask yourself that.

54:05.209 --> 54:08.077
Because you kill me, the only
way you enjoying that reward

54:08.079 --> 54:10.412
is TV shopping from a
death row prison cell.

54:13.650 --> 54:15.084
We saved your life.

54:15.086 --> 54:17.686
I asked you not to do that.

54:17.688 --> 54:22.324
Not my fault you don't
heed fair warning.

54:22.326 --> 54:23.092
So long, kidnapper.

54:33.336 --> 54:35.838
You some kind of sorcerer, boy?

54:35.840 --> 54:37.106
Oh, you have no idea.

54:51.121 --> 54:53.789
I told you, I didn't
want to go back!

55:05.268 --> 55:06.702
JED: Hold me.

55:22.652 --> 55:23.619
Hold me.

56:12.268 --> 56:13.035
Lola!

56:16.940 --> 56:17.706
Lola!

56:26.516 --> 56:29.785
Take me, crush me, kill me.

56:29.787 --> 56:31.653
I got you, baby.

56:31.655 --> 56:34.056
I got you.

56:34.058 --> 56:35.391
Never let me go, never.

56:35.393 --> 56:36.191
Never.

56:36.193 --> 56:38.293
Don't ever take me back.

56:38.295 --> 56:39.061
OK.

56:53.910 --> 56:55.377
[gunshot]

57:46.129 --> 57:47.095
What is this?

57:50.667 --> 57:51.467
This is the morning.

57:51.469 --> 57:53.368
This is bullshit.

57:53.370 --> 57:54.770
It's the right thing.

57:54.772 --> 57:55.571
It's not!

57:55.573 --> 57:56.972
It's not the right thing.

57:56.974 --> 57:58.407
You fucking asshole!

57:58.409 --> 57:59.808
MICHAEL FRANKLIN
(ON PHONE): Yeah.

57:59.810 --> 58:00.976
Hello, Mr. Franklin.

58:00.978 --> 58:02.411
MICHAEL FRANKLIN (ON
PHONE): Ah, the kidnapper.

58:02.413 --> 58:04.680
MARLO: Let's clear
this up right now.

58:04.682 --> 58:06.949
Did you or did you not offer
a million dollar reward

58:06.951 --> 58:08.083
for your daughter's return?

58:08.085 --> 58:09.551
MICHAEL FRANKLIN (ON
PHONE): For her rescue.

58:09.553 --> 58:11.086
From the kidnapper.

58:11.088 --> 58:12.955
No no, no, no, no, no, no.

58:12.957 --> 58:15.357
No, I saw you on TV.

58:15.359 --> 58:17.259
Now, what your wife
said was, the reward

58:17.261 --> 58:19.228
is open to anyone that
returns our daughter to us

58:19.230 --> 58:20.662
safe and sound.

58:20.664 --> 58:21.997
And that's me.

58:21.999 --> 58:23.398
I'm the guy trying to
return your daughter

58:23.400 --> 58:24.733
to you safe and sound.

58:24.735 --> 58:26.502
MICHAEL FRANKLIN (ON PHONE):
Tell me where you are?

58:26.504 --> 58:27.703
Not until you believe me.

58:27.705 --> 58:29.137
MICHAEL FRANKLIN (ON
PHONE): I believe you.

58:29.139 --> 58:30.172
Now tell me the truth.

58:30.174 --> 58:31.507
Because if you think
I'm going to listen

58:31.509 --> 58:34.843
to any more of your bullshit,
you don't know me at all.

58:39.249 --> 58:41.917
Mr. Franklin.

58:41.919 --> 58:45.787
The truth is, I love
your daughter very much.

58:45.789 --> 58:47.422
MICHAEL FRANKLIN (ON
PHONE): Oh, my god.

58:47.424 --> 58:49.791
No, she loves me too.

58:49.793 --> 58:51.260
We're in love.

58:51.262 --> 58:52.427
MICHAEL FRANKLIN
(ON PHONE): I have

58:52.429 --> 58:54.596
seen footage of you
dragging my daughter out

58:54.598 --> 58:56.565
of a goddamn church, no less.

58:56.567 --> 58:58.634
The whole nation saw it.

58:58.636 --> 59:00.402
Why do you think Lola
doesn't want to come home?

59:00.404 --> 59:02.271
MICHAEL FRANKLIN (ON PHONE):
Oh, she wants to come home.

59:02.273 --> 59:03.472
Why did she run away?

59:03.474 --> 59:05.340
MICHAEL FRANKLIN (ON
PHONE): She didn't run away.

59:05.342 --> 59:06.642
You kidnapped her.

59:06.644 --> 59:08.110
Uh, Mr. Franklin,
if I kidnapped her,

59:08.112 --> 59:10.245
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

59:10.247 --> 59:12.915
No, we'd be having a
ransom-type conversation.

59:12.917 --> 59:16.351
We'd be arranging money,
and times, and places.

59:16.353 --> 59:18.253
No, we wouldn't be discussing
whether or not she ran away

59:18.255 --> 59:21.023
from home, or why the idea
of her returning is so awful,

59:21.025 --> 59:22.991
she'd choose a life on
the run over the love

59:22.993 --> 59:25.494
and comfort of her own family.

59:25.496 --> 59:30.999
So I ask you again, sir--
why did she run away?

59:31.001 --> 59:32.901
MICHAEL FRANKLIN (ON PHONE):
You listen to me, smartass--

59:32.903 --> 59:35.037
whether you're the
kidnapper or not,

59:35.039 --> 59:37.673
whether you're in love with
her or not, it doesn't matter.

59:37.675 --> 59:39.541
The only thing to do
is arrange an exchange

59:39.543 --> 59:41.710
where you give me
my daughter, and I

59:41.712 --> 59:42.945
will give you your reward.

59:42.947 --> 59:43.712
My reward?

59:46.282 --> 59:47.482
I can guess what that is.

59:47.484 --> 59:48.917
MICHAEL FRANKLIN (ON
PHONE): Give me a time

59:48.919 --> 59:51.019
and a place, or this
conversation is over.

59:53.656 --> 59:56.091
Time and a place, kidnapper.

59:59.062 --> 01:00:01.263
All right.

01:00:01.265 --> 01:00:03.699
Now, here's what
you're going to do.

01:00:03.701 --> 01:00:05.067
You're going to take
the million in cash.

01:00:05.069 --> 01:00:07.202
You're going to drive
to Van Nuys airport.

01:00:07.204 --> 01:00:08.904
Now, you take off
and you fly east.

01:00:08.906 --> 01:00:10.238
Stay below 10,000 feet.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:13.008
You should be in
cell phone contact.

01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:15.377
Well, now I'm a kidnapper.

01:00:25.355 --> 01:00:27.789
COP (ON TV): I don't
know the facts.

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:31.627
But what I do know is
that a man doing what

01:00:31.629 --> 01:00:36.965
he believes to be right is
the most dangerous kind of man

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:37.933
we got.

01:00:51.748 --> 01:00:55.083
You really think they're
going to bring the money?

01:00:55.085 --> 01:00:58.387
I have no idea.

01:00:58.389 --> 01:01:00.822
They're going to eat me.

01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:02.858
They're going to
stick me to a wall,

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:05.293
and lay eggs in my stomach,
and it's going to chew

01:01:05.295 --> 01:01:07.129
and gash through my chest.

01:01:07.131 --> 01:01:08.063
And they're going to eat me.

01:01:14.303 --> 01:01:15.737
MICHAEL FRANKLIN
(ON PHONE): Yeah.

01:01:15.739 --> 01:01:17.706
MARLO: You up in the air?

01:01:17.708 --> 01:01:18.974
MICHAEL FRANKLIN
(ON PHONE): We are.

01:01:18.976 --> 01:01:19.808
OK.

01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:20.976
Here's what you're going to do.

01:01:20.978 --> 01:01:23.045
You're going to turn north
and fly low until you

01:01:23.047 --> 01:01:25.147
see a big plane bone yard.

01:01:25.149 --> 01:01:26.515
You see, you put
the money in the bag

01:01:26.517 --> 01:01:28.083
and toss it out the window.

01:01:28.085 --> 01:01:30.719
That bag lands on the far
north side of the wreckage.

01:01:30.721 --> 01:01:33.522
You'll have Lola
back safe and sound.

01:01:33.524 --> 01:01:36.425
But I see black and white or
flashing light of any kind,

01:01:36.427 --> 01:01:37.859
you will not.

01:01:43.332 --> 01:01:45.033
I should've let you die.

01:02:16.432 --> 01:02:18.900
Mama's got the
big gun this time.

01:02:36.352 --> 01:02:39.855
Is she gonna shoot?

01:02:39.857 --> 01:02:42.691
I wish she'd just
get on with it.

01:02:58.808 --> 01:03:00.108
I have your money.

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:03.378
But not your manners.

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:09.317
Mama, I'd like you
to meet Lola Franklin.

01:03:09.319 --> 01:03:12.254
Lola, this is Mama.

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:17.092
MAMA: Come down here, child.

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:22.664
Ooh.

01:03:22.666 --> 01:03:24.466
I like her.

01:03:24.468 --> 01:03:26.668
In a few minutes, a
plane is gonna fly over.

01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:31.106
And from that plane is gonna
fall a bag full of money.

01:03:31.108 --> 01:03:37.245
My heart breaks for a child
who's never felt a mama's love.

01:03:37.247 --> 01:03:42.851
But when a child betrays that
love, it leaves a wound in Mama

01:03:42.853 --> 01:03:46.388
don't never heal itself right.

01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:48.390
All that I have to
offer you is in that bag.

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:56.231
Well, as a cash for
kidnappee exchange, the plan's

01:03:56.233 --> 01:03:57.899
got some bite,
I'll give you that.

01:03:57.901 --> 01:04:03.171
But you left your mama
out of your reckoning.

01:04:06.209 --> 01:04:09.277
And I can't pretend that
that didn't hurt my feelings.

01:04:12.148 --> 01:04:14.249
Two minutes.

01:04:14.251 --> 01:04:16.585
Get in the van, honey.

01:04:16.587 --> 01:04:19.721
Mama's going to take you home.

01:04:19.723 --> 01:04:22.624
Mm hm.

01:04:22.626 --> 01:04:25.794
Come on.

01:04:25.796 --> 01:04:26.761
Here puppy puppies.

01:04:31.234 --> 01:04:32.200
Come on.

01:04:49.986 --> 01:04:51.419
You've killed us.

01:04:59.161 --> 01:05:00.295
Why didn't we
wait for the money?

01:05:00.297 --> 01:05:01.696
Why didn't we wait
for the money?

01:05:07.536 --> 01:05:09.571
You just let mama take care.

01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:54.816
You scared?

01:05:57.553 --> 01:05:59.054
Yes.

01:05:59.056 --> 01:06:01.022
Come.

01:06:01.024 --> 01:06:02.524
[screaming]

01:06:02.526 --> 01:06:05.961
Get out of the cage!

01:06:05.963 --> 01:06:07.028
No!

01:06:07.030 --> 01:06:09.297
You just cross your
pretty legs, honey.

01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:10.765
We'll be right back.

01:06:10.767 --> 01:06:12.200
LOLA: No!

01:06:12.202 --> 01:06:13.201
Marlo, I love you!

01:06:13.203 --> 01:06:15.136
I know.

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:17.739
LOLA: No!

01:06:17.741 --> 01:06:18.540
No, don't leave me.

01:06:18.542 --> 01:06:20.041
Where are we going?

01:06:20.043 --> 01:06:21.409
Shh.

01:06:21.411 --> 01:06:22.911
LOLA: Please, please
don't leave me here.

01:06:22.913 --> 01:06:24.612
I don't want to go.

01:06:24.614 --> 01:06:25.480
Shh.

01:06:25.482 --> 01:06:26.815
It's gonna be all right.
-Mama.

01:06:26.817 --> 01:06:27.782
LOLA: Marlo!

01:06:27.784 --> 01:06:29.551
Mama, I don't want to go.

01:06:29.553 --> 01:06:30.518
I'm gonna make it all right.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:31.453
LOLA: Marlo!

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:50.038
Scammin' and stealin' may
well be the crust of life.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:54.342
But there's only one meat
worth putting in that pie.

01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:55.110
Yeah?

01:06:55.112 --> 01:06:55.877
What's that?

01:06:58.481 --> 01:06:59.981
Why, love, of course.

01:07:02.752 --> 01:07:07.856
Do you know what it
is to love, child?

01:07:07.858 --> 01:07:13.228
To tend, and cherish a living
thing that all it wants to do

01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:16.531
is cut you up to pieces?

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:18.166
I believe I do.

01:07:18.168 --> 01:07:21.169
Oh, if you did, you would
not have done what you did.

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:34.182
What you know is to
steal and harm and hurt.

01:07:34.184 --> 01:07:37.118
At that, you are an expert.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:41.723
Love is something in
which you need schooling.

01:07:41.725 --> 01:07:43.058
That's not true.

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:44.459
Yes it is.

01:07:44.461 --> 01:07:46.394
No it is not!

01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:48.830
Yes it is!

01:07:48.832 --> 01:07:50.265
I'm sorry, baby.

01:07:50.267 --> 01:07:51.733
Look at me.

01:07:51.735 --> 01:07:55.637
Look at me.

01:07:55.639 --> 01:07:58.640
You gotta put your
hand on your heart

01:07:58.642 --> 01:08:00.642
for a true and proper sorry.

01:08:00.644 --> 01:08:04.145
Will you do that?

01:08:04.147 --> 01:08:07.082
I promise I'll do everything
I can to forgive you.

01:08:22.298 --> 01:08:23.064
Well?

01:08:26.602 --> 01:08:27.702
I'm sorry, Mama.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:31.872
Elaborate.

01:08:31.875 --> 01:08:34.109
I'm sorry I stole from you.

01:08:36.745 --> 01:08:38.979
For the dollars, yes,
but more so for the hurt

01:08:38.982 --> 01:08:40.515
I must have cost you.
-Mm hm.

01:08:40.517 --> 01:08:42.584
My little boy.

01:08:42.586 --> 01:08:44.853
You hurt me. [inaudible].

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:45.653
[inaudible].

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:47.788
Yes ma'am.

01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:52.060
And I'm sorry you had to come
cross country and fetch me.

01:08:52.062 --> 01:08:55.296
Oh, I am trying, Marlo.

01:08:55.298 --> 01:08:57.465
I am really trying.

01:08:57.466 --> 01:09:00.768
I know you can do it, Mama.

01:09:00.770 --> 01:09:04.606
You've got a big
heart, and I know it.

01:09:04.608 --> 01:09:06.573
I'm sorry, baby.

01:09:06.576 --> 01:09:12.046
Words alone are
not enough to right

01:09:12.048 --> 01:09:14.282
the injury you have done me.

01:09:14.283 --> 01:09:16.151
You've got that
big reward coming.

01:09:16.153 --> 01:09:19.287
My heart's broken, Marlo.

01:09:19.288 --> 01:09:21.221
You gotta mend that.

01:09:21.224 --> 01:09:23.224
MARLO: I will, Mama.

01:09:23.225 --> 01:09:24.926
You gotta make that right.

01:09:24.928 --> 01:09:27.929
MARLO: You tell me how.

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:31.399
Tell me how to make it right.

01:09:31.401 --> 01:09:35.236
You do it gentle, darling.

01:09:35.238 --> 01:09:37.337
You do it real gentle.

01:09:40.475 --> 01:09:42.042
Come to Mama, now.

01:09:42.045 --> 01:09:42.844
No.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:46.648
You show Mama you love her.

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:48.649
Shh, pretty baby.

01:09:48.652 --> 01:09:50.618
Mama's here.

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:51.618
No, Mama!

01:09:51.621 --> 01:09:52.386
No!

01:10:14.777 --> 01:10:15.543
Where's Mama?

01:10:19.415 --> 01:10:22.784
I'm not so sure
she's really my mama.

01:10:22.786 --> 01:10:25.186
MARLO: Marlo!

01:10:25.188 --> 01:10:26.120
Marlo!

01:10:26.122 --> 01:10:28.223
You OK?

01:10:28.225 --> 01:10:30.124
It's difficult to say.

01:10:30.126 --> 01:10:31.593
What?

01:10:31.595 --> 01:10:32.427
What happened?

01:10:32.429 --> 01:10:34.162
Uh, you what?

01:10:34.164 --> 01:10:35.697
No.

01:10:35.699 --> 01:10:37.131
I don't know what.

01:10:37.133 --> 01:10:37.899
What happened?

01:10:42.471 --> 01:10:44.205
Speaking as a man
that just unravelled

01:10:44.207 --> 01:10:47.642
his own parental
mystery, discovering

01:10:47.644 --> 01:10:50.845
but little satisfaction
in the experience--

01:10:50.847 --> 01:10:54.048
you say your parents
are monsters?

01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:57.418
That's fine by me.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:59.887
I believe you.

01:10:59.889 --> 01:11:01.489
You believe me?

01:11:01.491 --> 01:11:02.257
I do.

01:11:05.227 --> 01:11:06.027
Really?

01:11:06.029 --> 01:11:06.961
Absolutely and completely.

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:18.573
Hey, don't cry.

01:11:18.575 --> 01:11:19.974
I didn't want to
tell you before,

01:11:19.976 --> 01:11:25.313
because I-- I didn't want you
to think I was all messed up.

01:11:25.315 --> 01:11:28.082
But I am.

01:11:28.084 --> 01:11:29.050
I'm all messed up.

01:11:32.988 --> 01:11:36.424
I'm going to tell you now.

01:11:36.426 --> 01:11:40.561
I'm going to tell you the truth.

01:11:40.563 --> 01:11:44.666
You don't have to
tell me anything.

01:11:44.668 --> 01:11:45.433
I know.

01:12:08.290 --> 01:12:11.459
BABY LOLA (CRYING): Mommy!

01:12:11.461 --> 01:12:12.226
Daddy!

01:12:20.202 --> 01:12:24.605
MARLO: So the real
kidnappers are your parents?

01:12:33.048 --> 01:12:35.016
You were a cute baby.

01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:41.789
Alabama.

01:13:28.704 --> 01:13:30.271
So is this the place?

01:13:33.809 --> 01:13:35.243
I don't know.

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:44.185
You want me to go with you?

01:13:47.723 --> 01:13:48.890
Yeah.

01:13:48.892 --> 01:13:49.657
OK.

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:22.256
It's OK.

01:14:27.262 --> 01:14:30.932
