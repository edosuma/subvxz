[Buddy Stephens] <i>I won't do it.</i>

01:13.740 --> 01:16.117
<i>I swear to God,</i>
<i>I won't coach a team like this,</i>

01:16.201 --> 01:19.079
<i>because all I saw was thug bullshit!</i>

01:20.246 --> 01:23.583
<i>We talked about having more pride,</i>
<i>but you didn't want to.</i>

01:23.666 --> 01:26.711
<i>So I tell you what,</i>
<i>go find another damn school to go to.</i>

01:26.795 --> 01:30.465
<i>And you ain't got nobody to blame</i>
<i>but the guy in the mirror.</i>

01:30.548 --> 01:34.177
<i>'Cause you didn't have to do that!</i>
<i>None of you did!</i>

01:34.260 --> 01:37.055
<i>That's horseshit!</i>
<i>I won't be a damn part of it.</i>

01:37.138 --> 01:39.182
<i>Give me another damn job!</i>

01:57.867 --> 02:01.496
[Drew Jubera] <i>The first time I came here,</i>
<i>when I crossed those railroad tracks,</i>

02:01.579 --> 02:06.876
<i>and you see the old downtown,</i>
<i>and the one thing that's operating</i>

02:06.960 --> 02:10.045
<i>is a Coke machine on the sidewalk.</i>

02:10.130 --> 02:12.132
{\an8}I mean, it really kind of tells you

02:12.215 --> 02:14.717
{\an8}everything you need to know
about the place.

02:24.477 --> 02:27.313
<i>You drive a mile on, further into it,</i>

02:27.397 --> 02:30.150
<i>and you come across this school,</i>
<i>which is...</i>

02:30.233 --> 02:33.653
<i>I don't know if you'd call it quaint,</i>
<i>but it's a nice little campus.</i>

02:33.736 --> 02:37.991
<i>And you drive a little further</i>
<i>and you see this football stadium,</i>

02:38.074 --> 02:43.580
<i>this 5,000-seat football stadium,</i>
<i>just sort of come out of the ground.</i>

02:43.663 --> 02:47.667
{\an8}<i>This is the center, the epicenter,</i>
<i>of Junior College Football.</i>

02:48.710 --> 02:51.170
And you wonder how that could even be.

02:52.964 --> 02:57.719
[Dr. Rick Young] <i>When I came here in '04,</i>
<i>we had the worst facilities in JUCO.</i>

02:57.802 --> 03:02.181
{\an8}I thought, "By golly, are we gonna
continue to be the doormat of the state,

03:02.265 --> 03:03.933
{\an8}or are we gonna try to get better?"

03:04.017 --> 03:05.435
{\an8}[chuckles] I wanna be number one.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.937
<i>And all that started with a good coach.</i>

03:08.062 --> 03:09.564
<i>When Buddy came in, he said,</i>

03:09.647 --> 03:12.984
"If you wanna win, hire me.
It's that simple."

03:16.529 --> 03:20.617
{\an8}There wasn't a big winning tradition,
and I knew we had a long way to go.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.995
Everybody was really looking
for something to hang their hat on.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.999
[Dr. Young] <i>Buddy and his team</i>
<i>were good recruiters.</i>

03:28.082 --> 03:30.126
[radio host] <i>Buddy Stephens</i>
<i>set a precedent,</i>

03:30.209 --> 03:33.796
<i>being able to get some transfers</i>
<i>that are coming back from Division I.</i>

03:33.880 --> 03:37.926
{\an8}<i>Guys who had been in trouble,</i>
<i>fails a drug test, flunks out of school,</i>

03:38.009 --> 03:40.553
<i>gets mad at his coach at Clemson</i>
<i>and cusses him out.</i>

03:40.637 --> 03:44.265
[Jubera] <i>Those elite athletes</i>
<i>who disappeared for a couple years</i>

03:44.349 --> 03:48.436
and then suddenly show up again at,
you know, Alabama

03:48.519 --> 03:51.731
{\an8}or the New England Patriots,
this is where they come from.

03:51.814 --> 03:53.816
{\an8}[Marcus Wood] <i>Whether they're guys</i>

03:53.900 --> 03:56.653
{\an8}whether they're guys that have had
off-the-field issues,

03:56.736 --> 03:58.863
{\an8}whether they're guys
that maybe are overlooked.

03:58.947 --> 04:02.283
<i>They get an opportunity to come here,</i>
<i>and it's kind of a proving ground for 'em.</i>

04:02.367 --> 04:04.661
[Jake Feeley] <i>I mean, you go to get out,</i>
<i>that's your purpose.</i>

04:04.744 --> 04:07.872
{\an8}You don't go to stay, you don't go
to have a good time, you know.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.165
I mean, you go to leave.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.669
[Dr. Young] <i>JUCO Football</i>
<i>is getting to be big business.</i>

04:12.752 --> 04:14.420
<i>And when he started winning,</i>

04:14.504 --> 04:16.923
it just... it got better and better
and stronger and stronger.

04:17.005 --> 04:22.053
[Buddy] <i>We run an offense</i>
<i>that's flashy, fast as lightning.</i>

04:22.136 --> 04:24.097
We're not gonna take the foot
off the gas pedal.

04:24.180 --> 04:25.598
You know, that's just what we do.

04:26.641 --> 04:29.852
[Dr. Young] <i>Those scores were unheard of</i>
<i>prior to the Buddy era.</i>

04:29.936 --> 04:32.689
[chuckles] <i>You get into this</i>
<i>East Miss mercy rule.</i>

04:32.772 --> 04:33.940
[Jubera] <i>The Buddy rule.</i>

04:34.023 --> 04:37.527
<i>I mean, it really was put in</i>
<i>to keep Buddy from running up the score.</i>

04:37.610 --> 04:41.406
Buddy made no friends,
and we didn't make any friends as a team.

04:41.489 --> 04:44.367
<i>He wants to win.</i>
<i>At life, at football, at everything.</i>

04:45.410 --> 04:47.578
That's the way it is.
Some people like you, some people don't.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.873
We're easy not to like, you know.

05:04.387 --> 05:06.681
[Brittany Wagner] <i>Once you win</i>
<i>a National Championship,</i>

05:06.764 --> 05:08.224
<i>I think that's the expectation.</i>

05:08.308 --> 05:09.892
<i>But once you win three?</i>

05:09.976 --> 05:13.187
I think the expectation
is to win a fourth National Championship.

05:13.271 --> 05:15.690
<i>We graduate everybody</i>
<i>that's supposed to graduate,</i>

05:15.773 --> 05:17.734
<i>and everybody goes D-I.</i>

05:17.817 --> 05:21.446
<i>Anything short of that,</i>
<i>everyone will be highly disappointed.</i>

05:35.501 --> 05:37.086
[radio host] <i>All right,</i>
<i>interview with Buddy Stephens.</i>

05:37.170 --> 05:42.091
<i>First interview of the 2015 season,</i>
<i>in three, two, one, cue.</i>

05:42.884 --> 05:46.137
{\an8}<i>Talking with Head Football Coach</i>
<i>Buddy Stephens of the EMCC Lions,</i>

05:46.220 --> 05:49.557
{\an8}<i>the back-to-back defending</i>
<i>National Champion Lions,</i>

05:49.640 --> 05:51.851
<i>winning three of the last four.</i>

05:51.934 --> 05:54.979
<i>Coach, it's another season,</i>
<i>high expectations once again.</i>

05:55.104 --> 05:57.565
Well, yeah, you know,
we've always talked all along.

05:57.648 --> 06:00.526
Our goal is to start off the season, uh,

06:00.610 --> 06:02.987
1-and-0 and be 1-and-0 after each game.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.363
And, uh, you know,

06:04.447 --> 06:06.908
when we first started this thing
eight years ago, it was to try to be--

06:06.991 --> 06:09.702
Have a winning record,
that's the number one goal.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.829
Win a North Division Championship,

06:11.913 --> 06:13.289
win a State Championship,

06:13.372 --> 06:16.292
and compete for
a National Championship. So...

06:16.375 --> 06:20.755
{\an8}We're really, really talented,
but we're really young in some places.

06:20.838 --> 06:22.757
{\an8}I told them last night
they need to grow up fast.

06:22.840 --> 06:26.719
{\an8}And if they don't grow up fast, you know,
they may get punched in the mouth.

06:28.262 --> 06:31.349
{\an8}Everybody's gonna wanna know
what WOS is. [chuckles]

06:32.350 --> 06:35.186
{\an8}Wofford Oran Stephens Jr.

06:35.269 --> 06:37.647
Which I thought was a great name...

06:38.689 --> 06:43.319
until I started school,
and then everybody would laugh at ya.

06:44.403 --> 06:46.447
"What? Wafford?"

06:47.198 --> 06:50.368
I said, "Okay, I'll go with W.O.," right?

06:50.451 --> 06:54.247
And then you go to class and they go,
"Woo. Woo Stephens?"

06:55.456 --> 06:56.874
"Here."

06:56.958 --> 06:59.210
And then, a guy tells me...

06:59.293 --> 07:02.213
I go to the library,
I get my library card. Right?

07:02.296 --> 07:06.300
First time in college, you know,
and so there's people that are there

07:06.384 --> 07:08.386
that, um, um...

07:09.470 --> 07:13.099
that are smarter than me
and some very smart people,

07:13.182 --> 07:15.184
so I'm looking forward to going in there.

07:15.268 --> 07:18.187
And, uh, I go in there and the guy says,

07:18.271 --> 07:21.065
"Oran... Oh, Oran.

07:21.149 --> 07:23.818
Do you know that's, like, from the Bible?

07:23.901 --> 07:27.113
Do you know Oran, in the Bible,
invented masturbation?"

07:29.615 --> 07:32.160
I didn't need to know that.
You know?

07:32.243 --> 07:33.870
I really didn't need to know that.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.622
[players grunting]

07:36.706 --> 07:39.083
-[Wood] Striding, move your ass.
-[all grunting]

07:39.167 --> 07:41.294
Stride to me now, stride to me,
let's go, let's go.

07:41.377 --> 07:43.171
Pick it up,
you've got to be able to pick up...

07:43.254 --> 07:46.966
I wanna see you practice like
a number one team's supposed to practice.

07:47.049 --> 07:49.427
Do not waste what God gave you.
Do you understand me?

07:49.510 --> 07:50.553
-[all] Yes, sir.
-Am I clear?

07:50.636 --> 07:52.138
-[all] Yes, sir.
-Let's go, line up.

07:52.221 --> 07:53.681
[player] Great day to get better, baby.

07:56.559 --> 07:57.560
[chuckles]

08:02.982 --> 08:04.859
[man] There you go! Good.

08:04.942 --> 08:06.611
There you go. Drive!
Get your head across, there you go.

08:06.694 --> 08:10.406
-[blows whistle]
-Quick, quick. Whoa! Whoa!

08:10.490 --> 08:12.575
Pick your damn feet up, Jordan.

08:12.658 --> 08:16.037
-You understand? Pick your feet up, son.
-[man 2] Don't look at him.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.796
{\an8}[Wyatt Roberts] <i>Did you know</i>
<i>you were already coming here</i>

08:25.880 --> 08:27.507
{\an8}or were you just trying
to get out on the market?

08:27.590 --> 08:30.968
{\an8}See, I did it so late that a lot of
the bigger schools was already filled up.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.011
{\an8}Like, it was like two weeks
before camp was about to start.

08:33.095 --> 08:34.804
Oh.

08:34.889 --> 08:37.600
I ain't never think I'd end up at a JUCO,
but it's different.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.644
Everybody got a different story.

08:39.727 --> 08:43.313
I came from Florida State.
I know I'm here for six months.

08:43.397 --> 08:46.734
I gotta do what I gotta do to get back
to another big-time Division I program.

08:46.817 --> 08:50.154
<i>I went from playing every snap</i>
<i>in high school to not playing at all,</i>

08:50.238 --> 08:51.405
<i>and, uh, it was tough for me.</i>

08:51.489 --> 08:53.866
<i>It started to make me</i>
<i>not love football anymore.</i>

08:53.950 --> 08:56.285
<i>I couldn't let somebody else</i>
<i>take my happiness, you know.</i>

08:56.369 --> 08:58.871
So, at the end of the day,
yeah, it's all about a team.

08:58.955 --> 09:02.416
But you gotta worry about yourself, too,
uh, to a certain extent, because

09:02.500 --> 09:04.669
<i>I came here for one reason</i>
<i>and one reason only, honestly,</i>

09:04.752 --> 09:08.130
<i>and that's to get me back</i>
<i>to the level I know I'm supposed to be at.</i>

09:09.090 --> 09:10.967
[Wyatt] <i>You're never gonna be</i>
<i>just handed the job, you know.</i>

09:11.050 --> 09:12.468
<i>That's not how it works around here,</i>
<i>you're gonna--</i>

09:12.552 --> 09:13.970
You know, you're gonna be tested.

09:14.053 --> 09:17.807
And so they brought in John, and that just
added another strength to the competition.

09:18.849 --> 09:21.602
So, you know, I've always been a guy
that likes competition.

09:21.686 --> 09:24.230
[stammers] You know,
I want the best guy to play.

09:24.313 --> 09:25.565
Whether it's me, or whether it's John.

09:25.648 --> 09:28.442
<i>You know, whoever puts us in the best</i>
<i>situation to win, that's what I want.</i>

09:28.526 --> 09:30.861
Your arms are loose?
You wanna just throw a little more?

09:30.945 --> 09:33.447
[John] I'm Gucci. I'm good.
Feel me? Let's play.

09:33.531 --> 09:34.657
[Buddy] Keep working!

09:34.740 --> 09:36.951
Keep working, keep working, keep working.
Move your feet!

09:37.034 --> 09:38.661
[players grunting]

09:38.744 --> 09:40.079
[Buddy] Very well done!

09:40.162 --> 09:41.539
[whistle blowing]

09:41.622 --> 09:43.749
What you see with Wyatt
is what you're gonna get.

09:43.833 --> 09:47.503
You know, he's extremely consistent
in getting it where the ball needs to be.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.422
<i>He knows the offense in and out,</i>

09:49.505 --> 09:53.175
but there's no way
he should be in a battle with John.

09:53.259 --> 09:56.679
[Buddy] Good. Run, run, run, run, run!
There you go! There you go.

09:56.762 --> 09:58.180
[whistle blowing]

09:58.264 --> 10:00.558
[Wood] Great job!
Man, we got that setup perfect.

10:00.641 --> 10:02.143
[Buddy] Hell, John.
Hold the ball! John! John!

10:02.226 --> 10:04.061
-Do that shit! That's what you do!
-[John] I gotcha. I gotcha.

10:04.186 --> 10:06.105
[Trickett] <i>John has every tool</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

10:08.524 --> 10:10.901
<i>I mean, physically, a tremendous athlete.</i>

10:10.985 --> 10:12.069
<i>He ran track at Florida State,</i>

10:12.153 --> 10:13.779
<i>which is one of the best track teams</i>
<i>in the country.</i>

10:13.863 --> 10:17.491
<i>He has one of the quicker releases.</i>

10:17.575 --> 10:19.994
<i>He's got an absolute canon for an arm.</i>

10:20.077 --> 10:23.247
Transfers in, and everyone knows
what transfers are in Junior College.

10:23.331 --> 10:26.834
You think that he's gonna start.
And that just upped Wyatt's game

10:26.917 --> 10:30.463
to a new other level, and he just played
lights out since John got here

10:30.546 --> 10:31.631
'cause he's a competitor.

10:31.714 --> 10:33.924
[stammering] <i>You know,</i>
<i>it's a Corvette and a truck.</i>

10:34.008 --> 10:36.302
So, really, it's just...
when you get your chance,

10:36.385 --> 10:37.720
you gotta make the most of it.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.764
Hey, on that, when you start feeling that,

10:39.847 --> 10:41.182
the hell with it, take off and run.

10:41.265 --> 10:42.725
-That's what you do!
-Huh.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.185
That's what you bring to the table.

10:44.268 --> 10:45.478
-Do you understand?
-Gotcha.

10:45.561 --> 10:46.604
[indistinct chatter]

10:47.855 --> 10:49.482
[Buddy] <i>You better get</i>
<i>your ass mentally ready.</i>

10:49.565 --> 10:51.192
Get your ass mentally ready,

10:51.275 --> 10:53.402
'cause this is gonna be
a big-time game for us.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.655
Okay? It's gonna be
a big-time game for them.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.323
You gotta get after it.

10:57.406 --> 10:59.533
Because we ain't got--
You don't get this but one chance.

10:59.617 --> 11:01.911
Now, you only get one chance
in what we're trying to do.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.705
You're not gonna beat great teams
by going out

11:04.789 --> 11:07.083
and just laying an egg
at practice now, okay?

11:07.166 --> 11:09.126
-Bring it. You got me?
-[all] Yes, sir!

11:09.210 --> 11:12.046
All right, Jawon, lead your team.
Let's go. Everybody touch somebody.

11:12.129 --> 11:13.172
Everybody touch somebody!

11:13.255 --> 11:14.423
-All right, let's go.
-[Jawon] Whose Father?

11:14.507 --> 11:16.634
[all] Our Father, which art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

11:16.717 --> 11:18.803
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
on earth as in heaven.

11:18.886 --> 11:21.263

and forgive us our trespasses...

12:06.851 --> 12:08.144

12:08.936 --> 12:10.980
Where I'm from,
I ain't never wanna go to class,

12:11.063 --> 12:12.731
I wasn't never in class.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.817
[stammering] In high school?

12:14.900 --> 12:16.902
Soon as I get in there.
"Hey, can I go to the bathroom?"

12:16.986 --> 12:20.656
-[Marcel laughing] Yeah.
-It is over with. It's over with.

12:20.739 --> 12:23.784
Sometimes, I used to get bad,
where I'd just leave and go home.

12:23.868 --> 12:26.787
Bro, I was in summer school--
Let me tell them...

12:26.871 --> 12:29.081
From seventh grade to the 12th. [laughs]

12:29.165 --> 12:31.125
[all laugh]

12:31.208 --> 12:35.713
Tillman, I was in summer school
all my fuckin' high school, bro.

12:35.796 --> 12:37.339
-Man, come on, bro.
-[Ollie] Hey, man!

12:37.423 --> 12:40.468
-JUCO opened my eyes. Scooba!
-[Marcel] Scooba?

12:40.551 --> 12:44.722
Scooba opened my eyes
this fuckin' wide, bro.

12:44.805 --> 12:47.641
Yeah, learned my lesson,
learned my lesson.

12:47.725 --> 12:50.311
Lesson well learned, too.
Especially here.

12:50.394 --> 12:52.313
They say y'all don't learn in Mississippi.

12:52.396 --> 12:54.773
[Ollie chuckling] They say
we don't do nothin' in Mississippi.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.025
[Marcel] Yeah, they say y'all don't learn.

12:56.108 --> 12:57.318
They say we don't do
nothin' in Mississippi.

12:57.401 --> 12:58.444
[Marcel] All y'all do is eat.

12:58.527 --> 13:02.156
Yo, they say we just fat-ass,
dumb-ass country folk.

13:02.239 --> 13:03.282
That fucked up, ain't it?

13:03.365 --> 13:05.201
-Yeah. Time to roll?
-Yeah. Mississippi.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.577
[Ollie] I'm fittin' to go.
Y'all ready to go?

13:06.660 --> 13:07.661
I'm hungrier than a motherfucker, too.

13:07.745 --> 13:08.787
I'm fittin' to get out of here.

13:09.705 --> 13:11.040
[laughing]

13:15.961 --> 13:17.046
We out!

13:19.548 --> 13:24.637
[Ollie] <i>I was, like, in trouble,</i>
<i>a whole lot, like, at school.</i>

13:24.720 --> 13:27.723

13:27.806 --> 13:30.017
<i>It just... in school, I was terrible.</i>

13:30.100 --> 13:33.354
Just not do my work,
[stutters] lot of absences.

13:34.396 --> 13:38.859
Just used to make big scenes about nothin'
in the middle of the hallway,

13:38.943 --> 13:41.737
in the middle of class, during class.

13:41.820 --> 13:43.864
Just childish stuff.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.241
[chuckles]

13:46.450 --> 13:49.453
[indistinct chanting]

14:12.017 --> 14:14.186
[all cheering]

14:20.526 --> 14:22.611
If y'all put that much energy
in classwork,

14:22.695 --> 14:25.489
we might could get some stuff
done around here.

14:25.573 --> 14:28.993
Okay, let's talk about class attendance.

14:29.076 --> 14:32.496
How many absences before you're dropped?

14:32.580 --> 14:35.416
[all clamoring] One...
two... three... four.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.878
[player] You shouldn't be absent
at all, so it doesn't matter.

14:38.961 --> 14:41.422
-Well, that's a great answer, James.
-[all chuckle]

14:41.505 --> 14:44.466
You're right.
But, just in case... [chuckles]

14:44.550 --> 14:46.844
Just in case, it's four.

14:46.927 --> 14:50.222
You get four unexcused.
On the fifth, you're dropped.

14:50.890 --> 14:54.226
Do not miss class!

14:54.310 --> 14:55.895
You're trying to graduate in December.

14:55.978 --> 14:59.148
You miss the fifth time
because you oversleep, and you're dropped.

14:59.231 --> 15:02.860
And that one oversleeping
causes you to not graduate,

15:02.943 --> 15:06.238
which causes you
to not go play somewhere else.

15:07.615 --> 15:08.991
There's no time off...

15:10.075 --> 15:13.120
with you trying to get out of here
and go D-I. None.

15:13.203 --> 15:16.749
[Wagner] <i>Eligibility specialist</i>

15:30.596 --> 15:34.892
<i>have unfortunate circumstances</i>

15:34.975 --> 15:37.853
You know, I think everyone deserves

15:37.937 --> 15:40.856
I think everyone deserves
the opportunity to have a second chance.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.359
And if we can give it to them,
then why not?

15:43.442 --> 15:45.527
Now, here's the deal, listen.

15:45.611 --> 15:48.489
You make straight C's,
what's your GPA?

15:48.572 --> 15:50.574
-[player] C.
-[all laugh]

15:50.658 --> 15:51.951
[chuckling]

15:56.789 --> 15:58.874
What is the number?
What is the number?

15:58.958 --> 16:00.668
[player] 2,0.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.544
-Are you eligible?
-[all] No.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.254
No!

16:04.338 --> 16:07.424
So for every class
that you're gonna make a C in,

16:07.508 --> 16:09.134
I have to have an A.

16:10.260 --> 16:14.723
So when I tell you this is your A class,
I mean it.

16:14.807 --> 16:18.268
We gotta balance it out,
somehow, some way.

16:18.352 --> 16:21.063
All right, we're ready for tomorrow,
sit on the front row.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.356
I have pencils, I have--

16:22.439 --> 16:24.900
Yes, sit on the front row.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.028
Act like you care.

16:29.405 --> 16:30.447
Okay?

16:32.449 --> 16:33.659
Love you.

16:33.742 --> 16:34.994
[indistinct chatter]

16:36.078 --> 16:37.287
[Wagner] <i>If somebody had said to me,</i>

16:37.371 --> 16:39.540
"You're gonna go to Scooba
and be at East Mississippi,

16:39.623 --> 16:42.209
and you're gonna work there for
seven years," and I would've been like,

16:42.292 --> 16:44.837
"No," [chuckles]
"I won't... No, I'm not."

16:44.920 --> 16:47.172
Um, but I mean, I do.

16:47.256 --> 16:51.760
I think this has been the place where
I've been able to impact the most people

16:51.844 --> 16:53.095
in that amount of time.

16:53.178 --> 16:58.684
I've always had a dream to...
make a difference.

16:58.767 --> 17:00.352
Like, to impact...

17:02.354 --> 17:05.941
people's futures, people's lives.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.608
Put me where I'm most effective,

17:07.693 --> 17:10.738
like, put me at the place
where I can impact people the most.

17:10.820 --> 17:14.992
And I think, right now, you know,
maybe this is just where I need to be.

17:44.772 --> 17:46.774
[Isaiah Jones] Don't mess up your--
[DJ Law] Hey, hey!

17:46.857 --> 17:49.109
[DJ] If I'm gonna lose it,
I'm gone. [laughs]

17:49.193 --> 17:50.694
{\an8}Told you I've been practicing, though.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.905
{\an8}You know, this is a normal Sunday.

17:52.988 --> 17:56.158
That's me, picked off.
Aw, man!

17:56.241 --> 17:58.786
-Big Gronk!
-[both laughing]

18:00.037 --> 18:01.789
{\an8}There ain't nothing to do.
Just football.

18:01.872 --> 18:04.708
{\an8}-Ain't nothing to do. Football.
-They make you love football.

18:04.792 --> 18:08.587
My mom had called me and said she had
talked to, uh, Coach Buddy Stephens.

18:08.670 --> 18:12.257
So he showed up at the house,
told me I got great talent.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.259
I don't need to waste my talent,
basically.

18:14.343 --> 18:18.097
So I sat in the room one day,
I thought about it.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.599
I was just like,
"I'mma go off and play football."

18:20.682 --> 18:22.434
I really don't, like...

18:22.518 --> 18:25.312
School, I love school.
School is...

18:25.437 --> 18:27.189
Education is everything.

18:27.272 --> 18:30.234
But it's not, um...
not something I'm really good at,

18:30.317 --> 18:34.613
so I go to school just to play football
and do something I love.

18:34.696 --> 18:36.323
[Isaiah] They want a three-peat, you know.

18:36.406 --> 18:38.283
[DJ] Three-peat.
We want another championship.

18:38.367 --> 18:41.453
[Isaiah] We just playing football,
honestly. They won that without us.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.872
When I got here,
they was on a winning streak.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.291
I was just join...
I just joined the club.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.668
[Isaiah laughs]

18:47.751 --> 18:49.711
-[chuckles] I--
-[Isaiah] Trying to keep it going.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.630
I just joined the club.
I got me a ring.

22:25.218 --> 22:27.763
And I sit in the bed and I think, like,

22:27.846 --> 22:32.768
"Okay, I'm playing football for him,
but I'm also missing him growing up."

22:32.851 --> 22:34.311
But if I get to the NFL,

22:34.436 --> 22:38.106
I'll be able to give him whatever...
whatever he wants, whatever he asks for.

22:38.190 --> 22:41.860
[woman] Okay,
so the first one is an ellipsis.

22:41.943 --> 22:44.738
It's not just like hit the period,
boom, boom, boom.

22:45.864 --> 22:49.951
What you do is you space
in front of the period,

22:50.035 --> 22:54.414
then you hit period, then you hit space,
then you hit period.

22:54.498 --> 22:58.001
So it's three spaced periods.

22:59.169 --> 23:00.587
[Wagner] <i>You're back already?</i>

23:00.670 --> 23:03.131
[Ollie] Yeah, I--
[Wagner] What's that?

23:03.215 --> 23:04.216
[Ollie] I don't know.

23:04.299 --> 23:05.926
Wait a minute,
you went in there to buy a book

23:06.009 --> 23:07.344
and you came out with headphones?

23:07.427 --> 23:09.930
Hey, listen, bro, they told me
I could buy anything with--

23:10.013 --> 23:11.348
[groaning] Oh, Ollie!

23:11.431 --> 23:13.141
-You need to buy your books.
-Hey--

23:13.225 --> 23:16.103
-Why didn't you buy a notebook?
-'Cause I got a notebook.

23:16.186 --> 23:18.688
No, you just came in here
asking me for a notebook.

23:18.772 --> 23:21.733
Come on, I got--
Listen...

23:21.817 --> 23:23.193
Yeah, I shoulda bought a notebook.

23:23.276 --> 23:25.362
Yeah, you should've bought a notebook.

23:25.445 --> 23:27.489
Maybe you should
go back in there right now,

23:27.572 --> 23:29.407
while you're right here,
and go buy a notebook.

23:30.367 --> 23:33.745
[chuckles] I know you want to
try my stuff on. After I just bought--

23:33.829 --> 23:35.497
Hmm. Uh, these are not gonna fit you,

23:35.580 --> 23:37.916
'cause they fit me,
and your head's bigger than mine.

23:37.999 --> 23:40.127
[Ollie laughs] You got jokes.

23:40.210 --> 23:42.003
Yes, you do.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.840
[Wagner] Oh, "Wireless..."
Don't mess my hair up!

23:44.923 --> 23:47.384
-[clicks tongue]
-"Wireless stereo headphones.

23:47.467 --> 23:50.720
Pre-charged, use now." Really?

23:50.804 --> 23:52.889
Yep. [chuckles]

23:52.973 --> 23:57.227
{\an8}Man, Ollie is...
what we would call...

23:57.310 --> 23:58.937
He's a character.

23:59.062 --> 24:02.149
<i>Let me tell you that.</i>
<i>He's a character.</i>

24:02.232 --> 24:05.152
<i>Ollie will go</i>
<i>as far as Ollie let himself go.</i>

24:05.235 --> 24:07.362
<i>And that's what I try</i>
<i>to get him to understand.</i>

24:07.445 --> 24:10.365
<i>That, you know,</i>
<i>you can't play good one play.</i>

24:10.448 --> 24:12.701
You can't play good one quarter, one game.

24:12.784 --> 24:14.995
Every time you step out on this field,
you've gotta bring it.

24:15.078 --> 24:18.957
{\an8}<i>If you aspire to be in the NFL,</i>
<i>you gotta change the way you play.</i>

24:22.836 --> 24:24.963
[Williams] I'll go ahead
and tell you right now,

24:25.046 --> 24:27.674
I came to prepare the worst day
of your life playin' football.

24:27.757 --> 24:30.510
Ollie, you gotta get both hands
on this guard now.

24:30.594 --> 24:33.680
You let him go. Can't let him go. Why?

24:34.723 --> 24:36.558
I don't understand this.

24:36.641 --> 24:38.810
He hadn't made a play on the zone yet.

24:39.811 --> 24:41.313
Yet!

24:41.396 --> 24:43.815
See, what I'm sayin',
you got to stop this. Crash the pocket.

24:43.899 --> 24:44.941
[Ollie] Yes, sir.

24:45.025 --> 24:48.111
[Williams] I see you doin' this all day,
watchin' this tape. You just...

24:48.195 --> 24:49.237
runnin' round here.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.656
This quarterback still got the ball
and you doin' this.

24:52.574 --> 24:55.619
If I had somebody to put
right there in your spot, I would.

24:55.702 --> 24:57.829
I ain't got no choice
but to keep you there.

24:57.913 --> 25:00.665
So if we lose the ballgame, it's on you.

25:00.749 --> 25:05.170
If we get a guy that rush for
120-something yards on us, it's on you.

25:05.253 --> 25:07.047
Ain't on me.

25:11.468 --> 25:16.014
[Jubera] <i>Ronald Ollie comes from a town</i>
<i>about half the size of Scooba.</i>

25:16.097 --> 25:20.852
Um, and he grew up in a trailer
in the pinewoods of Mississippi there.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.437
<i>It's the Pine Belt.</i>

25:25.398 --> 25:28.568
{\an8}He's had a really traumatic life.

25:28.652 --> 25:30.695
{\an8}Um, both of his parents were killed
when he was younger.

25:30.779 --> 25:33.365
<i>Other family kind of raised him.</i>

25:33.448 --> 25:36.910
[Jubera] <i>And the one thing</i>
<i>he was good at was football.</i>

25:36.993 --> 25:39.454
<i>Schools were starting to look at him,</i>

25:39.537 --> 25:42.499
<i>his grades weren't there,</i>
<i>and he came here.</i>

25:44.542 --> 25:47.837
[Buddy] <i>He's so close</i>
<i>to being able to go out there</i>

25:47.921 --> 25:50.131
<i>and grab that SEC attention,</i>

25:50.215 --> 25:52.175
nationwide attention.

25:52.259 --> 25:54.427
He's just as close to grabbing that

25:54.511 --> 25:58.223
<i>as he is to not ever...</i>
<i>I mean, not playing anymore.</i>

25:58.306 --> 26:00.517
<i>So, you know,</i>
<i>we've gotta treat it with kid gloves</i>

26:00.600 --> 26:03.728
and we've also gotta treat it
with some tough love.

26:03.812 --> 26:05.855
How you do that, I don't know.

26:08.275 --> 26:10.652
[Jubera] <i>The hardest trick to me is...</i>

26:10.735 --> 26:13.488
<i>taking a bunch of kids</i>
<i>who have real problems,</i>

26:13.571 --> 26:17.575
<i>or a bunch of kids who've dropped down</i>
<i>from major Division I schools,</i>

26:17.659 --> 26:21.454
<i>and mold them into a team</i>
<i>and convince them</i>

26:21.538 --> 26:24.457
<i>that that will actually</i>
<i>enhance their reputation.</i>

26:24.541 --> 26:27.335
<i>None of these kids want to be here,</i>

26:27.419 --> 26:31.006
but they know they have to be
somewhere like this.

26:37.137 --> 26:38.596
[indistinct chatter]

26:38.680 --> 26:40.181
Man, he ain't asleep!

26:41.308 --> 26:42.475
[chuckling]

26:42.559 --> 26:44.144
[Buddy] Hey! Get in your locker.

26:44.227 --> 26:46.354
Get in your locker.
Get in your locker!

26:46.438 --> 26:50.233
You all give your attention
to Coach Wood real quick, please.

26:50.317 --> 26:52.319
{\an8}All right, here we go.
Let's start bringing your uniforms in.

26:52.402 --> 26:53.862
{\an8}This'll be your solid looks.

26:53.945 --> 26:56.531
You got six different ones
he's gonna bring in and show you.

26:56.614 --> 26:58.783
Coach Sallis, bring them on in, let's go!

26:59.451 --> 27:01.119
[catcalling]

27:06.916 --> 27:09.085
[laughing] That is nasty!

27:10.462 --> 27:13.506
Hey, Cory! Hey, Cory!
Do me--

27:13.590 --> 27:15.925
Hey! Hey! Walk...
walk this way real quick.

27:18.553 --> 27:20.055
That'd be nasty!

27:20.138 --> 27:22.223
[all laughing]

27:24.017 --> 27:27.937
[chanting] DJ Law! Law! Law! Law!

27:34.652 --> 27:35.779
There it is!

27:39.532 --> 27:40.950
[all laughing]

27:42.827 --> 27:44.662
[player] Hold up.
Hold up, hold up, hold up...

27:45.580 --> 27:47.207
[DJ] Hey, hey, hey, hey!

27:47.290 --> 27:49.000
I cost a little money, you know?

27:49.084 --> 27:51.711
Cost a little money. My little
East Mississippi cost a little money.

27:51.795 --> 27:54.005
Hey, when you champs you could do stuff
like this, you feel me?

27:54.089 --> 27:56.174
You could throw away...
you could throw away bank like this.

27:56.257 --> 27:57.842
-You know who that was?
-That's DJ Law.

27:57.926 --> 27:59.260
That's DJ Law, right there.

27:59.344 --> 28:01.554
You could throw away bank like this
when you win championships.

28:01.638 --> 28:02.722
[grunts]

28:02.806 --> 28:04.224
[laughs]

28:04.307 --> 28:07.102
[Wood] Uniform guys,
uniform guys, come here.

28:15.193 --> 28:17.362
[Chuck Luke] <i>Getting ready</i>
<i>to play this game tonight,</i>

28:17.445 --> 28:19.906
<i>and, uh, it's a lot of hard work</i>
<i>goes on around here,</i>

28:19.989 --> 28:22.951
<i>getting it all cleaned up and,</i>
<i>uh, ready to play.</i>

28:23.034 --> 28:24.744
I know the guys are ready to play.

28:24.828 --> 28:29.040
They've been practicing mighty hard and,
uh, they gonna have a great team.

28:29.124 --> 28:31.334
I've come out here and watched them
a little while the other night.

28:31.418 --> 28:32.710
Watched, so...

28:32.794 --> 28:36.131
We got a couple quarterbacks
battling for starting position,

28:36.214 --> 28:38.341
<i>but both of them look mighty good, man.</i>

28:38.425 --> 28:40.176
[stutters] I couldn't make that choice.

28:40.260 --> 28:41.928
I'm just gonna have to see
what choice they make,

28:42.011 --> 28:44.556
and I will stand behind them
on either choice they make.

28:44.639 --> 28:46.975
But, uh...

28:47.058 --> 28:49.728
I don't-- I don't think
they even know yet. [chuckles]

28:51.187 --> 28:53.606
[Wood] I like the idea
of some quarterback runs.

28:53.690 --> 28:57.110
[Buddy] I love Wyatt.
John just gives you something that just...

28:57.193 --> 28:58.528
He just has that explosion.

28:58.611 --> 29:00.655
{\an8}You're right on him,
but, I mean, he's gotta come off.

29:00.739 --> 29:03.575
{\an8}He runs flat right here,
that guy can't run with him.

29:03.658 --> 29:04.826
{\an8}Can't run with him.

29:04.909 --> 29:06.578
[Wood] <i>Wyatt's a guy that's been here.</i>

29:06.661 --> 29:10.206
Dedicated kid, hard-working guy,
talented guy.

29:10.290 --> 29:12.876
<i>John is a guy that will run more.</i>

29:12.959 --> 29:15.545
<i>Yeah, I mean, you...</i>
[stammering] <i>We're gonna play 'em both</i>

29:15.628 --> 29:18.131
<i>and keep getting after it,</i>
<i>so we'll see how it goes.</i>

29:18.214 --> 29:20.341
Run that--
Hey, run that last play back, please.

29:20.425 --> 29:21.843
[players panting on TV]

29:24.053 --> 29:25.889
-[crowd cheering]
-[whistle blowing]

29:25.972 --> 29:27.307
Oh, Jesus.

29:27.390 --> 29:28.558
[Wood laughs]

29:28.641 --> 29:30.351
[laughing] Oh, Jesus.

29:33.229 --> 29:34.939
[Wood] <i>It's hard being that</i>
<i>we're a throwing offense.</i>

29:35.023 --> 29:37.400
<i>If we were a running offense,</i>
<i>it would be easy to say,</i>

29:37.484 --> 29:39.152
<i>"You know what, he throws good enough."</i>

29:39.235 --> 29:41.946
<i>The fact that we're a throwing offense</i>
<i>and he's so sporadic,</i>

29:42.030 --> 29:43.490
<i>that's the hard part.</i>

29:43.573 --> 29:45.241
<i>That's the hard part to me.</i>

29:45.325 --> 29:47.160
<i>It's just the misfires.</i>

29:47.243 --> 29:48.953
[radio host] <i>Buddy,</i>
<i>one area that's helped you win</i>

29:49.037 --> 29:51.748
<i>the National Championship the last</i>
<i>two years has been quarterback play.</i>

29:51.831 --> 29:53.917
<i>Who's gonna take that first snap tonight?</i>

29:54.000 --> 29:56.503
Wyatt Roberts
is gonna take the first snap,

29:56.586 --> 29:58.004
and, um, you know he--

29:58.087 --> 30:02.175
We feel like Wyatt has done
an exceptional job, uh, this year,

30:02.258 --> 30:03.802
all the way through the summer.

30:03.885 --> 30:09.724
[stammering] Uh, but you'll see
John Franklin in there a lot as well.

30:09.808 --> 30:12.101
He'll have the opportunity
to try to win that starting job,

30:12.185 --> 30:15.188
but right now Wyatt Roberts has done
everything we've asked him to do.

30:15.271 --> 30:19.025
He's actually picked it up and had
really amazing numbers during fall camp.

30:19.108 --> 30:21.194
[radio host] <i>Well, Buddy, appreciate it.</i>
<i>Good luck to you tonight.</i>

30:21.277 --> 30:23.279
[Buddy] Thanks, man.
I appreciate it. Go, Lions!

30:24.531 --> 30:25.615
[Wagner] <i>Hey, Ollie!</i>

30:27.534 --> 30:29.118
It's game day!

30:30.036 --> 30:32.121
-I know.
-You look cute!

30:32.205 --> 30:33.623
-I look like the team.
-Yeah!

30:33.706 --> 30:35.208
[laughs]

30:35.291 --> 30:38.086
Y'all look cute,
except John's not participating.

30:38.169 --> 30:40.296
{\an8}We really have a game
in, like, a couple more hours.

30:40.380 --> 30:41.965
{\an8}[Wagner] I know,
how do you feel about that?

30:42.048 --> 30:43.049
Just another day.

30:43.132 --> 30:44.968
I feel regular. Like, I don't even feel
like I usually feel.

30:45.051 --> 30:46.052
Just another day.

30:46.135 --> 30:47.804
I used to be excited and stuff.
It's just another day now.

30:47.887 --> 30:49.597
-Just another day.
-I don't know why I feel like that now.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.558
Quit trying to be hard, John Franklin.
You're not hard.

30:51.641 --> 30:53.059
I'm not. I told you yesterday,
it's just another day.

30:53.142 --> 30:55.228
[Wagner] So it's just a regular day,
we're not excited?

30:55.311 --> 30:56.604
[Ollie] I'm not excited.

30:56.688 --> 30:59.858
When I get the pads on and stuff,
though, like... [clicks tongue]

30:59.941 --> 31:02.652
-[whooshes] I'm in the zone.
-[Wagner] Then you'll be excited?

31:02.735 --> 31:04.904
No, I ain't gonna be excited,
I'm gonna be in the zone.

31:05.947 --> 31:07.031
[music playing on phone]

31:07.115 --> 31:09.576
[Wagner] Can you even hear me
with that music up so loud?

31:09.659 --> 31:10.743
-Hey!
-[Wagner] What song is that?

31:10.827 --> 31:12.745
The dude right here
will make you go kill somebody, bro.

31:12.829 --> 31:14.539
-[Wagner] I wanna listen to it.
-I'm tellin' you, bro.

31:14.622 --> 31:17.125
This dude right here make you
wanna go kill somebody, bro.

31:17.208 --> 31:19.127
You gotta listen to Chief Keef
before a game.

31:19.210 --> 31:21.796
That's what I'm sayin', when I put
headphones on for the game, like,

31:21.880 --> 31:24.299
-and stuff like that, yeah...
-[laughs]

31:24.382 --> 31:26.843
I'm in straight killer mode then, oh.

31:27.594 --> 31:28.928
[John] Listen to Rich Homie Quan, too.

31:29.012 --> 31:30.346
[Wagner] Huh?
[both] Rich Homie Quan.

31:30.430 --> 31:31.431
Yeah.

31:31.514 --> 31:33.474
[both] Rich... Homie...

31:33.558 --> 31:34.559
Quan.

31:34.642 --> 31:37.312
All right, I've got a whole lotta songs
to listen to today.

31:37.395 --> 31:39.731
-Hey, Ollie, what's "yellow" mean?
-Who?

31:39.814 --> 31:41.816
Like that song said
something about purple and yellow.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.568
She talkin' about "Purple Be Coming In."

31:43.651 --> 31:45.028
-Purple...
-From Future.

31:45.111 --> 31:46.237
-[chuckles]
-"Good and yellow."

31:46.321 --> 31:48.239
What's yellow?
I know what purple is, I learned that.

31:48.323 --> 31:49.908
-What's purple?
-Marijuana.

31:49.991 --> 31:51.618
-[laughs]
-Marijuana. [chuckles]

31:51.701 --> 31:54.746
-It is, isn't it? Isn't it?
-[whistles] Whoo, look at you.

<i>at about the two-yard line,</i>

51:29.044 --> 51:31.171
<i>but he just put a move on.</i>

51:31.254 --> 51:37.469
{\an8}<i>Lions start off the 2015 season</i>
<i>in fine fashion. 69-20.</i>

51:37.552 --> 51:39.095
{\an8}[Buddy] <i>We're gonna be</i>
<i>more dominant next week.</i>

51:39.179 --> 51:40.388
{\an8}[all] <i>Yes, sir.</i>

51:40.472 --> 51:42.390
You understand? We have to be
more dominant next week.

51:42.474 --> 51:44.518
You gotta keep 'em down. Everybody!

51:44.601 --> 51:47.187
They gotta know when they
walk on the field with us,

51:47.312 --> 51:48.563
there ain't no hope.

51:48.647 --> 51:50.774
Everybody, get in here tight. Let's go.

51:50.857 --> 51:55.695
Hey, enjoy the night, enjoy the win.
It's one of many.

51:55.779 --> 51:57.531
Everybody touch somebody.

51:57.614 --> 51:58.615
Our Father...

51:58.698 --> 52:00.283
[all] Which art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

52:00.367 --> 52:01.368
Thy kingdom come...

52:01.451 --> 52:03.954
[John] <i>I ain't never scored</i>
<i>69 points in a game.</i>

52:04.037 --> 52:05.622
I had all that balled up in me
for two years, man.

52:05.705 --> 52:08.625
It was ready to come out of me.
It was time for it to come out, man.

52:10.085 --> 52:11.419
[reporter] <i>Two great plays</i>
<i>by Ronald Ollie tonight.</i>

52:11.503 --> 52:13.213
[Buddy] <i>You know what...</i>
<i>You're very happy for him</i>

52:13.296 --> 52:16.550
that he gets to make those plays
'cause if everybody knew his story,

52:16.633 --> 52:19.386
it would be a lot of people
fighting for Ollie.

52:20.971 --> 52:23.139
[Daniel] Everything he do, man.

52:23.223 --> 52:25.600
Just say, "God is good," man.

52:25.684 --> 52:27.811
About to bring tears to my eyes, man.

52:27.894 --> 52:29.771
It's just... I'm proud, man.

52:31.606 --> 52:32.899
[DJ] Better not start cryin'...

52:33.817 --> 52:35.110
If you start...

52:35.193 --> 52:37.153
you can take a walk or something.

52:37.237 --> 52:38.864
[all laugh]

52:39.948 --> 52:41.283
[Wagner] <i>I mean, when I'm watching them</i>

52:41.366 --> 52:45.161
run the ball a hundred yards
to score a touchdown, I mean...

52:46.246 --> 52:48.039
I throw up in my mouth a little.
[chuckles]

52:48.123 --> 52:51.042
Like, uh...
you know, it's like, "Oh, crap."

52:51.793 --> 52:54.796
<i>You kinda start to realize,</i>
<i>"Okay, like, these are the guys</i>

52:54.880 --> 52:56.923
<i>that I'm gonna have to get eligible</i>
<i>a year from now."</i>

52:57.007 --> 52:58.383
<i>And that first game,</i>

52:58.466 --> 53:00.760
<i>the names that I heard</i>
<i>over and over and over again,</i>

53:00.844 --> 53:02.512
<i>they have all done</i>
<i>really well on the field</i>

53:02.596 --> 53:04.347
<i>and they're not doing</i>
<i>very well in the classroom,</i>

53:04.431 --> 53:07.434
<i>and it's really gonna be a struggle</i>
<i>to get Division I eligible.</i>
