"Maya sat on the edge
of the dock"

01:12.376 --> 01:15.771
her bright blue eyes
searching the night sky.

01:15.814 --> 01:18.904
She wondered if a purpose was
something you were born with.

01:18.948 --> 01:21.777
A calling that tugged at you
from deep inside.

01:21.820 --> 01:23.518
Or if it was simply
the name you gave

01:23.561 --> 01:26.564
to whatever it was
you ultimately fell into

01:26.608 --> 01:29.915
to lend it an importance
it might not deserve.

01:29.959 --> 01:32.004
She hoped it was the former.

01:32.048 --> 01:34.398
"She liked to believe
she was meant for more."

01:42.363 --> 01:44.060
Um, right here, green jacket.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.062
Hello, Skye...

01:46.106 --> 01:48.151
I read that publishers
had turned away your books

01:48.195 --> 01:51.154
for five years before
you finally wrote 'Maya's Fall.'

01:51.198 --> 01:53.287
I'm a writer, or at least,
I'm trying to be.

01:53.330 --> 01:55.003
I was wondering if you could
talk for a little bit

01:55.027 --> 01:58.727
about how you keep going
in the face of rejection.

01:58.770 --> 02:00.424
Prove them wrong.

02:00.468 --> 02:04.167
Make it happen,
by any means necessary...

02:04.211 --> 02:06.291
and then forward them
your sales numbers anonymously.

02:08.215 --> 02:10.304
Okay, next question. Um...

02:10.347 --> 02:12.262
You, young lady.

02:12.306 --> 02:14.177
- Hi.
- Hello.

02:14.221 --> 02:16.571
When are you gonna
write the sequel?

02:16.614 --> 02:18.877
There are no plans for a sequel.

02:18.921 --> 02:21.576
But, I have a new book.

02:21.619 --> 02:24.274
It's called 'So Dark The Waves.'
I just finished it.

02:24.318 --> 02:26.102
I really hope
you'll give it a shot

02:26.146 --> 02:28.191
it is the best thing
I've ever done.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.062
So it just ends there?

02:30.106 --> 02:32.848
You're really going to
leave Maya like that?

02:32.891 --> 02:35.198
She didn't even make it
to Albuquerque.

02:35.242 --> 02:37.287
Um, we grow attached

02:37.331 --> 02:39.550
to these characters
and their lives.

02:39.594 --> 02:42.510
And sometimes it's hard to
say goodbye to people you love.

02:42.553 --> 02:44.816
Um, let's see.

02:44.860 --> 02:48.385
I'm sorry,
we're all out of time.

02:48.429 --> 02:50.735
Thank you all for coming,
and let's hear it again

02:50.779 --> 02:52.998
for our guest tonight,
author Skye Chaste.

03:01.006 --> 03:03.487
I usually get paid
as soon as the event ends.

03:03.531 --> 03:05.489
I'm sorry,
we don't cut the checks here.

03:05.533 --> 03:07.187
They go out
from the main office.

03:07.230 --> 03:09.450
But you'll have it
in five to ten business days.

03:09.493 --> 03:11.452
Can't you make an exception?

03:11.495 --> 03:13.758
I'm sorry.
It's, it's store policy.

03:13.802 --> 03:16.283
But, please, um, help yourself
to anything that's on the table.

04:35.797 --> 04:36.928
One-twenty.

04:38.756 --> 04:40.889
I was barely here eight hours.

04:42.412 --> 04:44.371
Ma'am, we don't do hourly rates.

04:44.414 --> 04:46.634
We're not that type
of establishment.

04:57.645 --> 04:59.603
I am done with the tours,
Chelsea.

04:59.647 --> 05:01.997
I barely break even.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.521
'So Dark The Waves, ' let's just
set up a virtual session.

05:07.045 --> 05:08.351
They're passing.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.399
What do you mean?

05:12.442 --> 05:14.052
They didn't like it.

05:16.838 --> 05:18.709
'Maya's Fall' made them
a lot of money.

05:18.753 --> 05:20.494
I know.

05:20.537 --> 05:23.279
They won't even put
an editor onto it?

05:27.022 --> 05:28.284
"Pretentious.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.113
Convoluted nonsense."

05:31.156 --> 05:33.115
"Written by a sociopath."

05:33.158 --> 05:35.030
My God.

05:35.073 --> 05:37.598
That one was off the record,
just ignore that last one.

05:39.730 --> 05:41.471
Well...

05:41.515 --> 05:43.386
Can't we just
take it somewhere else?

05:43.430 --> 05:44.830
That was three
different publishers.

05:46.128 --> 05:48.522
Look...

05:48.565 --> 05:51.394
It's a sophomore slump.
It happens to the best of them.

05:51.438 --> 05:54.832
- I spent two years on that.
- You can't take it personally.

05:54.876 --> 05:57.574
I bled for that book, everything
on those pages is me.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.418
How am I not supposed to
take this personally?

05:59.446 --> 06:00.969
Look, there's one recipe

06:01.012 --> 06:02.536
for continued success.

06:02.579 --> 06:03.798
Repetition.

06:03.841 --> 06:05.365
When you find something
that works

06:05.408 --> 06:06.931
you need to give them
more of the same.

06:06.975 --> 06:08.368
You mean, a sequel.

06:08.411 --> 06:10.152
Or, better yet, a trilogy.

06:10.195 --> 06:12.415
'Maya's Return, '
'Maya's Revenge.'

06:12.459 --> 06:14.417
Send the kid to the moon
for all I care.

06:14.461 --> 06:18.421
And Jesus Christ!
Can you deliver a love interest?

06:18.465 --> 06:20.815
It's like you don't know
your readers at all.

06:20.858 --> 06:24.427
Look, the guy should be brooding

06:24.471 --> 06:25.820
but give him a puppy.

06:25.863 --> 06:26.821
How about I just make him

06:26.864 --> 06:28.866
perpetually shirtless?

06:28.910 --> 06:30.433
Now you're thinking.

06:30.477 --> 06:31.608
Chelsea...

06:33.393 --> 06:35.133
I am dead broke.

06:36.874 --> 06:39.399
I don't know how much longer
I can get by.

06:39.442 --> 06:40.922
You need money?

06:40.965 --> 06:43.707
Get me something that will sell.
Simple as that.

06:57.155 --> 06:58.418
Sorry.

06:58.461 --> 07:00.332
I-I didn't mean to scare you.

07:03.597 --> 07:05.468
Did you need something?

07:05.512 --> 07:07.470
I thought maybe
you'd recognize me.

07:08.558 --> 07:10.386
Can't say that I do.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.649
I was at the reading last night,
at the Bookmark?

07:14.477 --> 07:17.262
Did you follow me here?

07:17.306 --> 07:20.570
No, no, I-I was just walking,
and I saw you...

07:20.614 --> 07:22.006
I'm a really big fan.

07:22.050 --> 07:23.530
I wanted to say hello last night

07:23.573 --> 07:25.140
but I chickened out.

07:25.183 --> 07:27.664
I'm not great with crowds.

07:27.708 --> 07:30.580
Don't beat yourself up over it.

07:30.624 --> 07:32.558
It's just, I traveled a really
long way to see you

07:32.582 --> 07:34.366
and I have a million questions.

07:34.410 --> 07:37.457
Do you maybe have
a little time to talk?

07:37.500 --> 07:39.937
I just spent two weeks
in ten different cities.

07:39.981 --> 07:43.375
I am tired and hungry
and I just wanna get home.

07:43.419 --> 07:44.855
There's an address
on my website.

07:44.899 --> 07:46.442
You can send any questions
you have there

07:46.466 --> 07:49.164
in a self-addressed
stamped envelope.

07:49.207 --> 07:51.601
I-If you're hungry,
I could buy you breakfast.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.608
Holly. Is that with a Y?

08:00.175 --> 08:02.699
How else would you spell it?

08:02.743 --> 08:04.396
Well, there is a,
a woman in Duluth

08:04.440 --> 08:06.486
who is spelt Catherine with a Q.

08:06.529 --> 08:08.009
Now I always ask.

08:16.017 --> 08:18.976
"The main difference
between a cat and a lie"

08:19.020 --> 08:21.675
is that the cat
has only nine lives.

08:21.718 --> 08:24.025
"Truly yours, Skye Chaste."

08:25.722 --> 08:27.681
Isn't that how Mark Twain
signed his books?

08:28.595 --> 08:29.726
Yeah.

08:31.772 --> 08:33.034
But he's dead now, so I figure

08:33.077 --> 08:34.426
you know, he's not using it.

08:42.739 --> 08:44.349
Um, sorry, did you want one?

08:44.393 --> 08:46.264
No, that's okay.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.840
I didn't realize
they were selling those.

08:56.884 --> 08:58.625
Ha.

08:58.668 --> 09:01.671
I, um, I had it made.

09:01.715 --> 09:03.760
Wow, you really are a fan.

09:03.804 --> 09:06.589
The biggest.

09:06.633 --> 09:09.244
There's something else
I wanted to ask you.

09:09.287 --> 09:11.899
Yeah. We're on your dime.
Ask away.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.511
I'm a writer.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.121
Well, not like you, but...

09:17.165 --> 09:18.949
I feel like there's a story

09:18.993 --> 09:21.212
I need to tell.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.040
And I was hoping
you could help me.

09:24.868 --> 09:26.566
I have a book.

09:26.609 --> 09:28.045
It's almost done, but I...

09:28.089 --> 09:29.917
I'm having trouble
writing an ending.

09:32.006 --> 09:34.878
I'm, I'm not really sure
what I can do for you.

09:34.922 --> 09:36.576
You can mentor me.

09:36.619 --> 09:38.839
Give me notes.

09:38.882 --> 09:41.232
Your author's bio said you
used to run writer's workshops.

09:41.276 --> 09:44.235
I don't do that anymore.

09:44.279 --> 09:45.996
Plus, once you start
publishing your own stuff

09:46.020 --> 09:48.544
you just open yourself up
to all kinds of lawsuits.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.653
Give notes on some terrible
script, next thing you know

09:50.677 --> 09:53.593
you're being sued because yours
takes place on the same planet.

09:53.636 --> 09:56.073
So, no thanks.

09:56.117 --> 09:57.477
But I can,
I can recommend someone.

09:57.509 --> 09:59.468
I think I, um, have a number.

09:59.511 --> 10:01.252
I don't want their opinion.

10:01.296 --> 10:02.514
I want yours.

10:05.474 --> 10:06.997
I could pay you.

10:10.697 --> 10:12.873
It's gonna take
a lot more than lunch.

10:12.916 --> 10:16.311
- I have money.
- From what, your paper route?

10:16.354 --> 10:18.052
I've saved $2000.

10:20.968 --> 10:24.145
Wait, you're currently
in possession of $2000?

10:32.370 --> 10:34.503
Okay, kid.

10:34.546 --> 10:37.767
But I do not copy edit, okay?
My grammar is trash.

10:37.811 --> 10:39.682
Thank you so much. Really.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.249
This means the world to me.

10:45.253 --> 10:46.709
Alright, I'm gonna go to
the bathroom. You'd settle up

10:46.733 --> 10:47.864
the check?

11:03.097 --> 11:05.839
Alright, we'll go to my place,
I'll read your book.

11:05.882 --> 11:08.624
I'll give you my notes,
you pay me, then leave, deal?

11:09.320 --> 11:10.452
Deal.

11:15.065 --> 11:16.893
Y-you okay to drive?

11:18.982 --> 11:20.505
I am inviting you into my home.

11:20.549 --> 11:22.899
This is an exercise of trust
for all involved.

11:24.466 --> 11:25.728
Hop in.

12:31.881 --> 12:34.841
- You coming?
- Yeah.

12:34.884 --> 12:37.495
Guess I just can't believe
I'm actually here.

12:42.283 --> 12:44.546
I'm gonna go unpack
and scrub off ten cities'

12:44.589 --> 12:47.592
worth of filth.
But, you can start here.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.814
Go ahead and print off a draft

12:51.858 --> 12:53.598
and we'll take a look at it
when I'm out.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.373
All done?

14:12.373 --> 14:14.766
What are you doing?

14:14.810 --> 14:17.030
I was looking for more paper.

14:18.379 --> 14:19.902
It's not up here.

14:21.164 --> 14:23.036
Paper's under the desk.

14:27.127 --> 14:28.737
Downstairs.

14:47.103 --> 14:49.560
If you're gonna be here, we need
to establish some ground rules.

14:49.584 --> 14:51.238
The first being,
don't touch my stuff.

14:51.281 --> 14:54.023
The second being,
don't touch my stuff.

14:54.067 --> 14:55.435
Who was that,
in all those pictures?

14:55.459 --> 14:57.113
He's Paul.

14:57.157 --> 14:58.419
Paul Walsh?

14:59.899 --> 15:01.944
How do you know that name?

15:01.988 --> 15:04.599
From the dedication,
in the front of the book?

15:04.642 --> 15:06.601
- "For Paul Walsh, with love."
- Right.

15:08.603 --> 15:10.763
- What happened to him?
- That's none of your business.

15:12.868 --> 15:14.261
Bring it out when it's ready.

15:45.118 --> 15:47.859
Skye, I'm really sorry

15:47.903 --> 15:50.384
I didn't mean to upset you.
It's...

15:50.427 --> 15:53.213
Sometimes, I'm too curious
for my own good and...

15:53.256 --> 15:55.606
I just-I have a problem
with boundaries, but...

15:55.650 --> 15:58.044
Knowing that I upset you, I,
it makes me feel really bad.

15:58.087 --> 16:00.220
Okay, stop.

16:10.143 --> 16:12.362
I think we could all use
a little time out.

16:18.629 --> 16:20.675
I haven't dusted
these off in forever.

16:23.808 --> 16:26.550
I don't get too many
visitors out here.

16:26.594 --> 16:28.552
Middle of nowhere
is great for writing

16:28.596 --> 16:30.598
but terrible for company.

16:32.687 --> 16:35.429
And no one can hear you scream.

16:35.472 --> 16:38.084
Yeah, let's, let's not do that.

16:43.872 --> 16:45.743
So, what do they
do for fun, in, um...

16:47.093 --> 16:49.356
Where're you from again?

16:49.399 --> 16:51.010
Alaska.

16:53.273 --> 16:54.728
Your family was okay with you
coming all this way

16:54.752 --> 16:57.277
just to get a book signed?

16:57.320 --> 17:00.062
I don't really have a family.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.978
Been on my own for a while now.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.633
It's been a hard
couple of years.

17:05.675 --> 17:08.505
My mom died,
and my dad died shortly after.

17:10.637 --> 17:11.987
Damn.

17:13.162 --> 17:15.469
Finding the book, it...

17:15.512 --> 17:17.297
It helped me get through them.

17:19.386 --> 17:23.085
When I looked at Maya,
I saw myself.

17:23.128 --> 17:25.653
You know, it was like things
finally made sense for me.

17:27.655 --> 17:30.571
You've just had such a profound
impact on my life

17:30.614 --> 17:33.182
and even if it meant
selling everything I owned

17:33.226 --> 17:35.576
and leaving
everything else behind.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.884
I knew I had to meet you.

17:50.634 --> 17:52.462
Shoot, ha.

18:01.297 --> 18:03.038
Paul is my fiance.

18:07.173 --> 18:09.871
We met at a writing retreat
I was running...

18:12.352 --> 18:15.442
and he proposed to me
over there, under that tree.

18:20.795 --> 18:23.493
Six months later, he...

18:23.537 --> 18:25.843
walked into our living room

18:25.887 --> 18:27.149
with a gun.

18:28.890 --> 18:30.050
And put a bullet in his head.

18:36.637 --> 18:39.161
So, I packed up

18:39.205 --> 18:40.510
every piece of him

18:40.554 --> 18:43.426
and put it in the attic.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.298
Because, screw him, right?

18:48.301 --> 18:50.085
Okay.

18:51.173 --> 18:52.653
No title.

18:52.696 --> 18:54.437
I haven't thought of one.

18:54.481 --> 18:55.786
Okay.

18:55.830 --> 18:58.398
Fantasy? YA?

18:58.441 --> 19:01.052
It's... sort of
a mystery, I guess.

19:01.096 --> 19:04.534
How far along are you?

19:04.578 --> 19:06.188
There's three chapters
left to write.

19:06.232 --> 19:08.321
And you're stuck?

19:08.364 --> 19:11.759
I don't have a resolution.

19:11.802 --> 19:13.804
If it's a mystery, you really
need to have the end

19:13.848 --> 19:15.850
in mind from the start.

19:15.893 --> 19:18.200
Guess I thought I could

19:18.244 --> 19:19.984
just wait and see
how it all turned out.

19:22.291 --> 19:24.250
That's a bold strategy.

19:24.293 --> 19:26.426
No title, no ending.

19:26.469 --> 19:28.558
Where are all my damn pens?

19:35.304 --> 19:38.264
I'm doing everything wrong,
aren't I?

19:38.307 --> 19:40.309
Your first novel
is supposed to be bad.

19:40.353 --> 19:43.225
You need to just get it out
of your system.

19:43.269 --> 19:45.401
And the next one will be good?

19:46.881 --> 19:48.665
No.

19:51.668 --> 19:54.497
You have a really
beautiful house.

19:54.541 --> 19:55.716
Thanks.

19:58.675 --> 20:00.634
These are cool.

20:00.677 --> 20:01.939
Where'd you get them?

20:03.419 --> 20:05.465
They belong
to the previous owner.

20:05.508 --> 20:08.772
He was pretentious.

20:08.816 --> 20:10.644
So, why'd you keep them up?

20:11.819 --> 20:13.473
I am also pretentious.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.434
How long have you lived here?

20:18.478 --> 20:20.915
A few years.

20:20.958 --> 20:23.570
Was it hard to stay
after Paul killed himself?

20:25.441 --> 20:27.226
Sharing time is over,
that subject

20:27.269 --> 20:28.966
is officially off-limits.

20:32.318 --> 20:34.058
What's your book about?

20:38.715 --> 20:41.022
The new one, that you mentioned
at the reading.

20:41.065 --> 20:43.503
'So Dark...'

20:43.546 --> 20:45.896
'...The Waves, ' um,
'So Dark The Waves.'

20:45.940 --> 20:50.988
It's about... guilt, loss

20:51.032 --> 20:54.078
the intrinsic dishonesty
of the human condition.

20:54.122 --> 20:57.168
Whoa. What's that mean?

21:00.998 --> 21:03.784
I'm trying something different.

21:03.827 --> 21:06.308
Is there a reason you don't
wanna write another Maya book?

21:06.352 --> 21:08.310
There are a lot of reasons.

21:10.443 --> 21:11.835
Do you not have any ideas?

21:11.879 --> 21:13.315
I have a great idea, how about

21:13.359 --> 21:14.795
we stop talking about this?

21:17.014 --> 21:20.017
Sorry. I'm just
a little nervous.

21:26.894 --> 21:29.549
Alright, Holly with a Y.

21:30.637 --> 21:32.465
Let's see what you got.

22:43.492 --> 22:45.015
What do you think?

22:46.887 --> 22:48.279
It's pretty rough.

23:04.165 --> 23:07.734
But it's not unsalvageable.

23:07.777 --> 23:10.389
I think with a lot of work, we
can whip this thing into shape.

23:11.302 --> 23:12.739
Yeah?

23:12.782 --> 23:14.305
Thank you so much.

23:21.878 --> 23:24.838
It's getting pretty late, I...

23:24.881 --> 23:26.405
I should find a motel.

23:28.755 --> 23:30.278
Um...

23:32.889 --> 23:34.630
Sorry.

23:34.674 --> 23:36.284
It's just, um...

23:37.981 --> 23:39.896
Yeah, it is getting late.

23:39.940 --> 23:44.510
So, why don't you just
stay here for a few days?

23:44.553 --> 23:46.468
You know, we can
roll up our sleeves

23:46.512 --> 23:50.864
and really whip this thing
into shape.

23:50.907 --> 23:52.822
I only have the 2000.

23:52.866 --> 23:55.912
We can figure something out.

23:58.349 --> 24:00.961
That's very generous of you.

24:02.832 --> 24:04.921
The guest bedroom is upstairs.

24:04.965 --> 24:07.097
The first door on the right.

24:07.141 --> 24:10.013
So, you have any questions
for me before I go to bed

24:10.057 --> 24:11.513
like where the clean towels
are, or...

24:11.537 --> 24:13.277
- No.
- Great.

24:13.321 --> 24:15.321
'Cause I don't think I have
any clean towels, so...

24:16.846 --> 24:19.240
Actually...

24:19.283 --> 24:22.025
could I stay down here
for a while

24:22.069 --> 24:24.114
and listen to some of those?

24:24.158 --> 24:26.029
Yeah.

24:26.073 --> 24:28.641
Knock yourself out.

24:28.684 --> 24:30.947
The turntable's on the piano.

24:30.991 --> 24:32.166
Thanks.

25:18.821 --> 25:21.824
Chelsea, I'm working
on something new.

26:01.603 --> 26:03.562
No, not, not that one.

26:11.004 --> 26:13.484
Just, pick another one. Okay?

26:13.528 --> 26:15.356
Did I do something wrong?

26:38.205 --> 26:39.336
Skye?

28:28.663 --> 28:30.926
- Morning!
- Hey, can you...

28:30.970 --> 28:32.754
Yeah. Sorry.

28:32.798 --> 28:34.800
It's fine.

28:34.843 --> 28:36.279
How'd you sleep?

28:36.323 --> 28:37.846
Like a log.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.197
Glad to hear it.

28:42.851 --> 28:44.766
Are we okay?

28:44.810 --> 28:47.073
I feel like I keep
making these mistakes.

28:47.116 --> 28:49.379
It's over, forget it. I have.

28:49.423 --> 28:50.903
You're out of coffee.

28:52.034 --> 28:53.427
And eggs.

28:55.081 --> 28:57.213
Who needs to eat, right?

28:57.257 --> 28:59.694
I found this in the back
of the cabinet.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.696
I left you some,
but there wasn't much left.

29:03.132 --> 29:04.786
I have business in town

29:04.830 --> 29:07.310
I can hit the grocery store
before I get home.

29:07.354 --> 29:09.573
So, any requests?

29:09.617 --> 29:10.879
No. Thank you.

29:12.446 --> 29:14.274
How long will you be gone?

29:15.884 --> 29:17.103
Most of the day.

29:17.146 --> 29:18.495
But...

29:19.932 --> 29:23.413
this... should keep you busy.

29:26.373 --> 29:28.592
Take a look, we can talk
when I get back.

29:29.637 --> 29:31.421
It's a good start.

29:31.465 --> 29:32.858
You really think so?

29:32.901 --> 29:34.773
Wouldn't say it
if I didn't mean it.

29:37.384 --> 29:39.952
You think I should add
a love interest?

29:39.995 --> 29:41.692
You got to know your audience.

29:43.651 --> 29:45.958
You trust me, right?

29:46.001 --> 29:47.394
Of course.

29:49.483 --> 29:52.616
Has anyone else given you
any input on the draft?

29:52.660 --> 29:55.184
No. You're the first person
I've shown it to.

29:56.446 --> 29:58.797
Perfect.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.450
Let's just keep it
between the two of us

30:00.494 --> 30:02.235
for now?

30:02.278 --> 30:03.627
Till it's done.

30:06.892 --> 30:08.850
Before I forget...

30:08.894 --> 30:10.852
The money you mentioned?

30:10.896 --> 30:12.898
Yeah?

30:12.941 --> 30:14.508
Could I...

30:15.378 --> 30:16.858
have it?

30:16.902 --> 30:19.556
Yeah, right. Of course.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.080
One sec.

30:49.586 --> 30:51.371
This is all I have on me

30:51.414 --> 30:52.851
but I can get more.

30:54.417 --> 30:56.855
This is... fine for now.

30:58.465 --> 31:00.902
Do me a favor.
Email me your file.

31:00.946 --> 31:02.469
I need to reformat it.

31:04.253 --> 31:06.647
Reformat?

31:06.690 --> 31:09.084
The margins are too wide,
the font is too big.

31:09.128 --> 31:11.086
It's throwing off
the page count.

31:11.130 --> 31:12.914
It's just the first draft.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.745
You wanna do this
correctly, right?

31:17.788 --> 31:19.592
I mean, I thought you said
you wanted to be a writer.

31:19.616 --> 31:21.792
- I do.
- Well...

31:21.836 --> 31:24.534
This is what writers do.

31:24.578 --> 31:26.101
You're paying me
a lot of money, Holly

31:26.145 --> 31:29.583
but if you'd rather
I just mail it in...

31:29.626 --> 31:32.412
No, of course not.
I'll, I'll send it right away.

31:32.455 --> 31:33.587
Great.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.637
Leave off the title page
for now...

31:40.681 --> 31:42.726
until we can think
of something catchy.

31:42.770 --> 31:45.164
Actually, I had some ideas
I wanted to run by you.

31:45.207 --> 31:46.905
Like...

31:46.948 --> 31:49.081
'Disappear Anchor, ' or

31:49.124 --> 31:51.170
I don't know, maybe 'Fan Girl?'

31:53.259 --> 31:55.391
Good start.

31:55.435 --> 31:56.915
Keep thinking.

32:07.577 --> 32:08.883
Chelsea.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.189
Hey, do you have a minute?

32:10.232 --> 32:12.234
I never have a minute.

32:12.278 --> 32:15.542
I have a new book for you.
I've been working on it a while.

32:15.585 --> 32:17.128
I didn't want to jinx it
by telling you.

32:17.152 --> 32:19.241
You know I hate surprises.

32:19.285 --> 32:21.983
You'll like this one, I think
it's really something special.

32:23.376 --> 32:25.334
No offense,
but that was the pitch

32:25.378 --> 32:27.946
for your last book and we
all know how that turned out.

32:30.339 --> 32:31.993
Look, I'm sending it to you now.

32:32.037 --> 32:33.837
Drop whatever you're doing,
and read it, okay?

33:23.784 --> 33:25.307
Should be all of it.

33:25.351 --> 33:27.068
I really appreciate you
grabbing this for me.

33:27.092 --> 33:29.181
What are neighbors for?

33:29.224 --> 33:31.420
You might want to read the one
from the electric company.

33:31.444 --> 33:33.185
It's towards the bottom.

33:35.491 --> 33:37.493
I did not go through your mail.

33:37.537 --> 33:40.105
It's just the envelope
is very bright.

33:40.148 --> 33:41.541
Orange.

33:41.584 --> 33:43.282
I think it's a final notice.

33:44.718 --> 33:46.894
I'll do that.

33:46.937 --> 33:48.548
Thanks again. I owe you one.

33:48.591 --> 33:50.506
Since you offered...

33:50.550 --> 33:53.248
We're having a big fundraiser
at the end of the month

33:53.292 --> 33:56.251
to send the high school
football team off to State.

33:56.295 --> 33:57.992
Go, Wolfpack!

33:58.036 --> 33:59.733
Well, anyway...

33:59.776 --> 34:02.257
Maybe we could get a few
of your autographed books

34:02.301 --> 34:03.737
to auction off?

34:03.780 --> 34:05.695
I'll pay for them.

34:05.739 --> 34:07.654
Yeah, sure, okay.

34:07.697 --> 34:09.612
Wonderful!

34:15.574 --> 34:17.228
You should look
at the gas bill, too.

34:23.583 --> 34:26.107
It's just very bright.

34:29.110 --> 34:30.155
Jesus!

36:01.681 --> 36:04.118
Hey. I made a breakthrough
on chapter 21.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.164
What are those pictures
doing out?

36:06.207 --> 36:09.254
I put them there.
I thought it might help.

36:09.297 --> 36:11.647
What right do you have
to meddle in my personal life?

36:13.432 --> 36:15.521
- I'm sorry.
- You're here to fix your book.

36:15.564 --> 36:17.392
You're not here to fix me.

36:21.614 --> 36:24.399
I didn't mean to upset you.

36:24.443 --> 36:27.446
But it's not good
to hold onto pain.

36:27.489 --> 36:28.925
Locking memories of him
in the attic

36:28.969 --> 36:32.015
isn't going to help you heal.

36:32.059 --> 36:33.558
You'll never be able
to move past what happened

36:33.582 --> 36:35.410
until you face it head-on.

36:37.282 --> 36:39.153
Maybe you wouldn't have
to drink this much.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.547
I drink because I like it.

36:41.590 --> 36:43.418
It seems like you need it.

36:46.421 --> 36:49.294
Who are you to say that to me?
You've known me two days.

36:49.337 --> 36:51.774
I've learned a lot about you.

36:51.818 --> 36:54.560
God. I totally get it now.

36:54.603 --> 36:56.301
No wonder you don't
have any family.

36:56.344 --> 36:59.260
They probably couldn't get away
from you fast enough.

36:59.304 --> 37:01.175
How could you say that?

37:01.219 --> 37:03.003
Yeah, not so fun, is it?

37:03.046 --> 37:05.397
When people make assumptions.

37:05.440 --> 37:08.443
Another valuable life lesson,
free of charge.

37:08.487 --> 37:09.899
You're nothing like
I thought you'd be.

37:09.923 --> 37:11.577
Yeah, well, never meet
your idols, kid.

37:14.406 --> 37:16.234
Damn!

37:17.539 --> 37:20.716
Is it a fuse?

37:20.760 --> 37:23.676
No, it's what happens when you
don't pay the electric bill.

38:35.617 --> 38:38.359
- Brought you these.
- Um. Thanks.

38:42.450 --> 38:44.626
Just remember to blow them out
before you go to bed.

38:44.670 --> 38:46.062
Of course.

38:50.502 --> 38:52.044
I'll call the electric company
in the morning.

38:52.068 --> 38:54.462
Work something out.

38:54.506 --> 38:57.117
I have a few more hours left
on my computer.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.312
I'll just write
by the candlelight

38:58.336 --> 38:59.772
like the pioneers used to do.

39:02.078 --> 39:03.384
You do that.

39:14.090 --> 39:15.744
Have you read it yet?

39:18.181 --> 39:20.270
Yes, I realize
it doesn't have a title.

39:20.314 --> 39:23.186
Just, um...
I was thinking, maybe...

39:23.230 --> 39:24.579
'Fan Girl?'

39:27.800 --> 39:29.584
Yeah, just,
just believe me, okay?

39:29.628 --> 39:31.760
It's gonna be the book
that turns my career around.

40:06.752 --> 40:08.667
How's it going, captain?

40:08.710 --> 40:11.757
Well, it's having about
a bit of trouble here.

40:11.800 --> 40:14.847
You're not even building it
in a bottle frame.

40:14.890 --> 40:16.414
You think you can do better?

40:16.457 --> 40:18.154
I know I can.

40:19.939 --> 40:23.464
Just need to have patience.

40:23.508 --> 40:25.945
Okay.

40:25.988 --> 40:29.035
See, that right there, it's
not helping my concentration.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.128
Look, we did it though.

40:35.171 --> 40:36.956
What would you do without me?

40:38.914 --> 40:42.222
I... don't wanna find out.

41:17.344 --> 41:18.998
Hey, knock it off.

41:28.877 --> 41:30.488
Is everything alright?

41:33.534 --> 41:35.188
You tell me.

41:37.059 --> 41:38.452
Everything's fine.

41:41.281 --> 41:43.631
Okay, well, I'm gonna need you
to stop whatever it is

41:43.675 --> 41:45.372
you're doing in there, then.

41:46.460 --> 41:48.593
What I'm doing?

41:48.636 --> 41:51.334
The banging.
What is with the banging?

41:52.945 --> 41:55.600
I'm not banging anything.

41:55.643 --> 41:57.515
Okay, well.

41:57.558 --> 42:00.213
Then, if you're not,
then who is? It's not me.

42:01.475 --> 42:03.129
I didn't hear anything.

42:04.739 --> 42:07.437
Are you serious?

42:07.481 --> 42:08.743
What did it sound like?

42:10.397 --> 42:13.182
Like banging,
loud banging on the wall.

42:15.620 --> 42:17.752
Honestly, I haven't
been banging anything

42:17.796 --> 42:19.580
and I haven't heard any banging.

42:25.238 --> 42:26.718
No, don't even...

42:29.547 --> 42:31.461
Maybe it was the wind.

42:31.505 --> 42:32.898
Or some tree branches.

42:34.334 --> 42:36.728
Are you messing with me?

42:36.771 --> 42:38.730
What is this?

42:38.773 --> 42:41.689
No, no. I'm not,
I'm not doing that.

42:47.129 --> 42:49.088
I'm not really sure
what you want me to say.

42:50.698 --> 42:52.265
Never mind.

42:53.266 --> 42:54.746
Just go back to bed.

43:42.228 --> 43:44.534
"'Love In The Western World'

43:44.578 --> 43:46.754
by Denis de Rougemont."

45:36.995 --> 45:38.126
It's how much?

45:39.824 --> 45:41.782
Can't I make a partial payment

45:41.826 --> 45:43.697
or get on some kinda plan?

45:45.307 --> 45:47.179
Can I speak with the manager?

46:23.128 --> 46:24.956
Who is this girl?

48:51.145 --> 48:52.581
Hello.

48:52.625 --> 48:53.626
I see you finally got

48:53.669 --> 48:54.801
your act together.

48:54.844 --> 48:56.585
- What?
- The book.

48:59.110 --> 49:00.807
S-s-so you like it?

49:00.850 --> 49:02.809
I love it!

49:02.852 --> 49:05.638
No, it's, it's way better
than that other crap

49:05.681 --> 49:06.900
you were trying to peddle.

49:06.944 --> 49:09.163
Okay, let's not go crazy.

49:09.207 --> 49:10.904
No, no, seriously.

49:10.948 --> 49:14.952
It's really great,
really inspired stuff.

49:14.995 --> 49:18.694
It's not a sequel,
but there is a market for this.

49:18.738 --> 49:20.522
Is it something you can sell?

49:20.566 --> 49:22.002
Are you kidding? I already sent

49:22.046 --> 49:23.917
the first few chapters
to the publishers.

49:23.961 --> 49:27.138
They're all eating crow.

49:27.181 --> 49:29.183
We officially have
a bidding war.

49:29.227 --> 49:32.447
And based on the success
of your last book...

49:32.491 --> 49:34.884
we're talking six figures,
maybe higher.

49:36.060 --> 49:37.278
Could you make it conditional?

49:39.237 --> 49:40.237
On what?

49:41.761 --> 49:43.719
That they publish
'So Dark The Waves.'

49:43.763 --> 49:46.200
- Skye.
- It's gotta be both.

49:46.244 --> 49:48.942
Alright. I will run it by them.

49:48.986 --> 49:50.944
How soon before you
finish this one?

49:58.386 --> 50:00.301
Have-have you read it yet?

50:02.521 --> 50:04.784
Yes, I realize
it doesn't have a title.

50:04.827 --> 50:07.395
I was thinking maybe, um...

50:07.439 --> 50:08.918
'Fan Girl?'

50:10.224 --> 50:12.922
Skye?

50:12.966 --> 50:14.489
Ju-just a couple days.

50:16.317 --> 50:18.232
There's a few things
I need to do first.

50:27.894 --> 50:29.287
Peace offering.

50:29.330 --> 50:31.071
I'm only 18.

50:31.115 --> 50:32.551
I won't tell.

50:32.594 --> 50:35.510
You ever figure out
what that noise was?

50:35.554 --> 50:36.792
Yeah, you know, I think
you're right, I think

50:36.816 --> 50:38.209
it was just a branch.

50:39.775 --> 50:41.429
It's still pretty windy.

50:45.390 --> 50:47.087
Are you going low-tech?

50:49.307 --> 50:50.482
My computer is almost dead.

50:50.525 --> 50:52.484
I... I found this
in your office.

50:52.527 --> 50:54.225
- I hope that's okay.
- Sure.

50:57.358 --> 50:59.186
The power should be back soon.

51:01.232 --> 51:03.408
It's really beautiful out here.

51:03.451 --> 51:05.062
I can see why you'd be inspired.

51:05.105 --> 51:06.846
Yeah.

51:06.889 --> 51:07.953
You know, it's easy to write
when it's the only thing

51:07.977 --> 51:09.544
to do, so...

51:13.940 --> 51:15.637
Look, I've had a rough
couple of days.

51:15.681 --> 51:17.509
I, I didn't mean to
take it out on you.

51:18.684 --> 51:20.642
No, it's okay.

51:20.686 --> 51:22.862
I understand.

51:22.905 --> 51:24.864
I can be pushy.

51:24.907 --> 51:26.735
I know that about myself.

51:29.999 --> 51:31.784
And you know a lot
about me, too.

51:33.438 --> 51:36.005
But I feel like I hardly
know anything about you.

51:37.833 --> 51:39.835
There's not much to tell.

51:39.879 --> 51:41.663
I'm sure that's not true.

51:44.231 --> 51:46.103
Do you have a boyfriend?

51:48.366 --> 51:51.020
Some strapping,
young moose hunter

51:51.064 --> 51:53.545
who is breathlessly
awaiting your return?

51:53.588 --> 51:55.508
I had a boyfriend
in high school, but we broke up

51:55.547 --> 51:57.897
um... when his family
moved away.

51:58.811 --> 52:00.813
Man.

52:00.856 --> 52:02.249
That's too bad.

52:05.122 --> 52:06.862
Well, you know...

52:06.906 --> 52:09.213
Happy love has no history,
and all that.

52:13.521 --> 52:16.133
It's de Rougemont.

52:16.176 --> 52:18.004
'Love In The Western World.'

52:20.049 --> 52:21.529
I've read it.

52:24.445 --> 52:25.533
So...

52:28.232 --> 52:30.016
What do you do for work?

52:32.453 --> 52:34.412
I used to work
at a convenience store

52:34.455 --> 52:37.241
but I, I quit
before I came out here.

52:37.284 --> 52:38.764
Why?

52:39.547 --> 52:41.027
I don't know.

52:41.070 --> 52:42.420
There was a couple of reasons.

52:46.293 --> 52:50.167
I was ready to move on anyway.

52:50.210 --> 52:53.387
Then, I saw you were
going on your book tour...

52:53.431 --> 52:56.521
and I took it as a sign.

52:56.564 --> 52:58.523
Maybe it was time
for a fresh start.

53:00.394 --> 53:01.743
So you just left?

53:03.571 --> 53:04.571
Yeah.

53:07.662 --> 53:09.186
That must've been hard.

53:11.536 --> 53:13.407
Leaving the place
that you grew up.

53:14.930 --> 53:16.758
Leaving all of your friends.

53:17.977 --> 53:19.674
I don't have any friends.

53:19.718 --> 53:21.589
Come on. Everybody has friends.

53:23.678 --> 53:25.506
I've always been
kind of a loner, I guess.

53:26.638 --> 53:28.509
There must be someone.

53:30.294 --> 53:32.731
Someone who misses you.

53:34.646 --> 53:35.995
Not really.

53:49.530 --> 53:51.619
- Skye?
- Yeah?

53:51.663 --> 53:54.274
I was wondering if you could
maybe drive me into town?

53:54.318 --> 53:56.624
But you're hitting your stride.

53:56.668 --> 53:58.235
You don't want to
lose your rhythm.

54:00.280 --> 54:02.345
It's just, I wasn't really
planning to be here so long.

54:02.369 --> 54:04.632
I... feel bad eating your food.

54:05.807 --> 54:06.807
You're my guest.

54:09.071 --> 54:10.638
If I go into town,
I can take out

54:10.682 --> 54:13.032
the rest of the money I owe you.

54:13.075 --> 54:15.469
I know you're good for it.

54:15.513 --> 54:17.689
You're so close to the end,
why stop now?

54:21.432 --> 54:22.868
Power's back.

54:56.031 --> 54:57.903
I made you some lunch.

54:59.078 --> 55:00.514
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

55:05.214 --> 55:07.042
Is this the last chapter?

55:11.046 --> 55:12.526
Most of it.

55:13.875 --> 55:15.224
Homestretch?

55:16.965 --> 55:18.053
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

55:19.446 --> 55:22.797
Well, keep going
till you're done, okay?

55:22.841 --> 55:25.713
I don't want to have to...
tie you to that chair.

56:59.894 --> 57:01.418
Fuck!

57:01.461 --> 57:02.897
Damn it!

58:35.642 --> 58:37.949
Hey, can I help you?! Hi!

58:37.992 --> 58:40.299
- I brought the books.
- Okay.

58:40.342 --> 58:43.824
You have something on your...

58:43.868 --> 58:47.045
Yup. Happens to me all the time
when I garden.

58:47.088 --> 58:49.351
You know, you know, right now
is not a really good time.

58:49.395 --> 58:51.876
I'm sorry.

58:51.919 --> 58:53.723
- Do you have company?
- No. No, no, it's just me.

58:53.747 --> 58:55.923
I-I, I'm-I'm in
the middle of something.

58:55.967 --> 58:57.621
It'll only take a minute.

58:57.664 --> 58:59.579
I was just so excited
that you agreed

58:59.623 --> 59:01.059
to help out with the auction

59:01.102 --> 59:02.887
that I bought off the store.

59:02.930 --> 59:04.125
I thought we could
get 'em signed

59:04.149 --> 59:05.367
and right up on the website.

59:06.673 --> 59:08.980
Okay. Sure, yeah,
let me see them.

59:09.023 --> 59:11.156
Here you go. You're an angel.

59:11.199 --> 59:13.027
Okay, do you have a pen?

59:16.291 --> 59:17.597
I don't.

59:20.295 --> 59:22.254
Okay, co... We'll go this way.

59:39.271 --> 59:41.012
I really do appreciate this.

59:41.055 --> 59:43.667
Sure, sure.

59:43.710 --> 59:45.712
Could you make that last one
out for my daughter?

59:45.756 --> 59:47.671
Emmilee. That's with two E's.

59:47.714 --> 59:50.674
- And two M's.
- What a beautiful name.

59:50.717 --> 59:52.782
You know, you really should
come into town more often.

59:52.806 --> 59:54.547
We'd love to have you
at the event.

59:54.591 --> 59:56.462
We're getting a band
from San Dimas.

59:56.505 --> 59:58.856
Thanks. I will try to do that.

59:58.899 --> 01:00:02.294
Yup, all alone out here
by yourself every day

01:00:02.337 --> 01:00:04.078
I think I'd go
a little stir-crazy.

01:00:07.952 --> 01:00:09.952
- You need help with that or...
- No, no. I'm good.

01:00:27.275 --> 01:00:28.929
Who was that?

01:00:28.973 --> 01:00:30.670
No one.

01:00:30.714 --> 01:00:32.063
Gotta go and clean up.

01:00:53.606 --> 01:00:55.216
I have something
for you look at.

01:00:59.046 --> 01:01:02.006
This is great.

01:01:02.049 --> 01:01:04.245
I was a little reluctant about
the love interest suggestion

01:01:04.269 --> 01:01:06.706
but, I think it worked.

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:07.968
It's a crowd-pleaser.

01:01:09.753 --> 01:01:11.711
The puppy was a fun addition.

01:01:11.755 --> 01:01:13.670
I named him Boots.

01:01:13.713 --> 01:01:16.324
Why Boots?

01:01:16.368 --> 01:01:18.283
When I was little,
we had a dog named Boots.

01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:21.590
Well...

01:01:21.634 --> 01:01:24.463
write what you know I guess.

01:01:24.506 --> 01:01:26.595
I'm glad you decided
to keep those up.

01:01:30.948 --> 01:01:33.298
I realized you had a point.

01:01:47.791 --> 01:01:49.314
What's a Lit PEN Award?

01:01:51.664 --> 01:01:54.232
Who knows? Hmph. Who cares?

01:01:56.147 --> 01:01:57.452
I think you do.

01:01:59.541 --> 01:02:01.108
You act like
it doesn't affect you

01:02:01.152 --> 01:02:03.545
but I think it matters to you
what people think.

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:08.681
You've got me all figured out.

01:02:10.814 --> 01:02:12.772
Seems like you resent it...

01:02:12.816 --> 01:02:14.818
'Maya's Fall.'

01:02:14.861 --> 01:02:16.210
It was supposed to open the door

01:02:16.254 --> 01:02:19.692
and not define my career.

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:22.477
Is it really so bad if it does?

01:02:22.521 --> 01:02:24.349
I mean, it's touched
so many people.

01:02:26.438 --> 01:02:29.006
No one wants to be
a one-hit wonder.

01:02:36.448 --> 01:02:37.623
Can I?

01:02:39.668 --> 01:02:40.800
Sure.

01:02:51.419 --> 01:02:52.856
Do you wanna hear a story?

01:02:54.727 --> 01:02:56.598
Always.

01:02:56.642 --> 01:02:59.819
It's been a while, I might
mix up some of the details.

01:02:59.863 --> 01:03:01.516
I'll keep that in mind.

01:03:03.649 --> 01:03:06.434
Around 1200 AD

01:03:06.478 --> 01:03:09.524
in a small Chinese village

01:03:09.568 --> 01:03:11.962
this man was found dead
in a wheat field.

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:18.055
He had deep, deep slashes...

01:03:19.839 --> 01:03:21.188
here...

01:03:23.321 --> 01:03:25.018
and here.

01:03:28.892 --> 01:03:30.371
He bled out in the field.

01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:34.027
Makes sense.

01:03:34.071 --> 01:03:35.351
They determined
the murder weapon

01:03:35.376 --> 01:03:36.813
was most likely a hand sickle

01:03:36.856 --> 01:03:40.164
but... in a village
full of wheat farmers

01:03:40.207 --> 01:03:42.514
almost everyone had one.

01:03:42.557 --> 01:03:44.516
There was no obvious suspects

01:03:44.559 --> 01:03:45.865
no witnesses...

01:03:47.693 --> 01:03:49.651
What did they do?

01:03:49.695 --> 01:03:51.412
The town's magistrate
had all the farmers line up

01:03:51.436 --> 01:03:53.568
their sickles against the wall

01:03:53.612 --> 01:03:55.788
and leave them out
in the hot sun.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.139
By the end of the day

01:03:59.183 --> 01:04:01.968
one of the sickles
was covered in flies.

01:04:04.014 --> 01:04:05.319
The blood.

01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:08.845
The blood.

01:04:08.888 --> 01:04:10.605
And even though the blade
had been wiped off

01:04:10.629 --> 01:04:12.065
traces still remained.

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:17.070
The owner broke down
and confessed.

01:04:17.114 --> 01:04:19.377
I think they hung him.

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:20.769
I'm not sure.

01:04:20.813 --> 01:04:22.380
That part's fuzzy.

01:04:24.948 --> 01:04:26.253
My dad told me that.

01:04:28.386 --> 01:04:30.605
That's a hell
of a bedtime story.

01:04:32.129 --> 01:04:34.000
It always stuck with me.

01:04:35.610 --> 01:04:36.960
It's a good reminder.

01:04:38.831 --> 01:04:40.354
Of what?

01:04:40.398 --> 01:04:43.183
That no matter what you do
to fight it

01:04:43.227 --> 01:04:45.794
the truth always
has a way of coming out.

01:04:48.667 --> 01:04:50.451
So what do you think?

01:04:50.495 --> 01:04:52.627
About what?

01:04:52.671 --> 01:04:54.934
The chapter.

01:04:54.978 --> 01:04:56.893
Does it work?

01:05:00.548 --> 01:05:01.898
It's, it's getting there.

01:05:03.856 --> 01:05:05.466
Here, try these.

01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:47.133
It's over. I...

01:06:48.569 --> 01:06:51.181
I finished.

01:06:51.224 --> 01:06:52.530
That's great.

01:06:53.792 --> 01:06:55.620
I can't wait for you to read it.

01:06:58.188 --> 01:06:59.406
Yeah, me neither.

01:07:01.495 --> 01:07:02.801
I wasn't sure I could do it

01:07:02.844 --> 01:07:03.908
but then suddenly the last word

01:07:03.932 --> 01:07:05.760
was on the page.

01:07:05.804 --> 01:07:07.980
We should celebrate.

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:10.156
How about, um, a game of Bocce?

01:07:12.724 --> 01:07:14.160
Isn't it kind of dark out?

01:07:17.424 --> 01:07:20.123
I have,
floodlights in the backyard.

01:07:23.561 --> 01:07:24.736
Come on.

01:07:29.175 --> 01:07:30.698
Can I be red?

01:07:33.005 --> 01:07:35.007
I-I'll even spot you points.

01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:39.794
We just need to get the set
from the garage.

01:07:41.361 --> 01:07:43.059
How 'bout a drink first?

01:07:45.713 --> 01:07:47.628
I thought you were too young.

01:07:47.672 --> 01:07:49.978
It's a special occasion.

01:07:50.022 --> 01:07:51.850
I think I've earned it.

01:07:56.159 --> 01:07:58.161
What's the best liquor
to toast with?

01:08:00.641 --> 01:08:02.252
You can't go wrong with bourbon.

01:08:04.776 --> 01:08:07.431
This one has a fun label.

01:08:07.474 --> 01:08:08.519
Will it work?

01:08:08.562 --> 01:08:10.216
Yeah, it's all good

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:11.696
in my book.

01:08:20.921 --> 01:08:23.881
You can, you can
fill it up more.

01:08:23.925 --> 01:08:26.276
You're living dangerously,
right?

01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:28.015
Right.

01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:42.029
To...

01:08:43.988 --> 01:08:45.207
To your first book.

01:08:46.252 --> 01:08:47.732
To Skye Chaste.

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.692
You're the reason
this is all happening.

01:09:02.312 --> 01:09:05.488
Whoo!

01:09:05.532 --> 01:09:09.145
Maybe I should have started
with something weaker.

01:09:09.188 --> 01:09:12.148
Just, one, two, three
and down the hatch.

01:09:14.715 --> 01:09:16.456
Come on, don't overthink it.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:19.154
No, after.

01:09:19.198 --> 01:09:22.506
I, I really can't wait
any longer.

01:09:22.549 --> 01:09:24.203
I wanna show you what I've done.

01:09:37.303 --> 01:09:38.303
Ta-da.

01:09:41.481 --> 01:09:43.657
Alright, it's a big moment.
You-you nervous?

01:09:44.745 --> 01:09:46.051
No.

01:09:46.094 --> 01:09:47.573
Not anymore.

01:09:57.105 --> 01:09:59.020
Wha-what is this?

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:01.980
The book.

01:10:03.938 --> 01:10:06.376
Do you think this is funny?

01:10:06.419 --> 01:10:09.161
No, I don't.

01:10:11.772 --> 01:10:12.904
Is everything okay?

01:10:14.166 --> 01:10:15.776
I'm just...

01:10:19.519 --> 01:10:21.782
What did you...

01:11:13.356 --> 01:11:14.966
Sorry.

01:11:15.009 --> 01:11:17.795
I didn't think
you'd be up this fast.

01:11:17.838 --> 01:11:19.425
The back of the bottle
didn't say how long you'd be out

01:11:19.449 --> 01:11:20.885
so I wasn't sure.

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:25.629
And I wasn't just gonna
sit in here with you and wait.

01:11:25.672 --> 01:11:28.849
That would be weird, right?

01:11:28.893 --> 01:11:31.504
Found the key to the garage
in your purse.

01:11:31.548 --> 01:11:34.725
Seemed like a good place
to talk.

01:11:34.768 --> 01:11:37.249
Although I suspect you had
another use in mind.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:40.165
I found this, too.

01:11:45.388 --> 01:11:46.911
No screaming, alright?

01:11:54.527 --> 01:11:57.791
Wh-what do you want?

01:11:57.835 --> 01:12:00.620
Money? I think it's pretty clear
I don't have any.

01:12:00.664 --> 01:12:03.362
I told you at the start of this,
I have a few questions.

01:12:03.406 --> 01:12:04.494
Okay.

01:12:06.670 --> 01:12:09.237
I want you to tell me
what happened to Paul Walsh.

01:12:11.152 --> 01:12:13.938
P-Paul?

01:12:13.981 --> 01:12:15.592
What does he has to do
with anything?

01:12:17.594 --> 01:12:18.899
How did he die?

01:12:21.511 --> 01:12:23.861
Is this some sick fantasy
o-of y-yours?

01:12:23.904 --> 01:12:26.385
You wanna know every tiny detail
of my life?

01:12:27.734 --> 01:12:29.780
How did he die?

01:12:31.216 --> 01:12:32.435
I...

01:12:32.478 --> 01:12:34.785
I told you how he died.

01:12:34.828 --> 01:12:36.613
Well, start from the beginning.

01:12:37.788 --> 01:12:40.486
Paul Walsh...

01:12:40.530 --> 01:12:43.271
bought that .357

01:12:43.315 --> 01:12:44.577
and shot himself.

01:12:44.621 --> 01:12:47.798
Wrong, you killed Paul Walsh.

01:12:50.017 --> 01:12:52.324
What?

01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:54.021
- No, I...
- You shot him.

01:12:54.065 --> 01:12:55.893
And you made it look like
a suicide.

01:12:58.765 --> 01:13:00.941
You're-you're crazy, I...

01:13:00.985 --> 01:13:03.335
No, I'm Maya.

01:13:08.819 --> 01:13:10.995
Maya's not real.

01:13:12.562 --> 01:13:14.607
You-you know that, right?

01:13:14.651 --> 01:13:16.870
She is real, she's me.

01:13:41.634 --> 01:13:44.463
You didn't put the bullets in?

01:13:44.507 --> 01:13:46.509
I-I thought they were
in there already.

01:13:46.552 --> 01:13:48.336
You didn't check first?

01:17:02.356 --> 01:17:04.141
Okay.

01:17:04.184 --> 01:17:06.099
Holly, listen.

01:17:06.143 --> 01:17:08.711
Maya, my name is Maya.

01:17:08.754 --> 01:17:10.321
Maya...

01:17:10.364 --> 01:17:13.541
is a character in a book
I wrote.

01:17:13.585 --> 01:17:16.066
No, she's a character
in a book he wrote.

01:17:18.416 --> 01:17:20.679
Bet you thought you had it
all figured out.

01:17:20.723 --> 01:17:23.551
Steal a dead man's book,
no one would ever know.

01:17:26.598 --> 01:17:29.209
How could you possibly
know that?

01:17:29.253 --> 01:17:32.256
Because Paul Walsh
was my father.

01:17:32.299 --> 01:17:35.085
He-he didn't have any children.

01:17:35.128 --> 01:17:37.957
He had a whole family,
until he left us.

01:17:39.785 --> 01:17:43.223
How do you walk out
on a seven-year-old girl?

01:17:43.267 --> 01:17:44.834
What could you've
possibly ever done

01:17:44.877 --> 01:17:46.662
to make him wanna leave?

01:17:48.228 --> 01:17:50.927
At first, he sent postcards.

01:17:50.970 --> 01:17:53.407
I tore them all up.

01:17:53.451 --> 01:17:56.759
Eventually, he stopped writing.

01:17:56.802 --> 01:17:59.587
Until a few years ago.

01:17:59.631 --> 01:18:02.895
He sent me an email.

01:18:02.939 --> 01:18:07.073
The very first draft
of his very first novel.

01:18:07.117 --> 01:18:10.033
One he told me I had inspired
him to write.

01:18:12.339 --> 01:18:15.342
"Maya sat at the edge
of the dock...

01:18:15.386 --> 01:18:19.738
her bright blue eyes
gazing the night sky."

01:18:19.782 --> 01:18:22.393
Imagine my surprise

01:18:22.436 --> 01:18:25.570
when I passed the bookstore
six months later.

01:18:25.613 --> 01:18:28.355
There, on the front display,
was 'Maya's Fall.'

01:18:28.399 --> 01:18:31.663
Only it had a different
author's name on the cover.

01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:34.318
I thought it had to be
a coincidence.

01:18:34.361 --> 01:18:36.189
But I bought it anyway.

01:18:38.801 --> 01:18:40.977
Every word was the same.

01:18:59.299 --> 01:19:01.432
Don't move.

01:19:01.475 --> 01:19:03.086
There's bullets in it this time.

01:19:07.264 --> 01:19:10.397
I, I didn't kill him.

01:19:12.312 --> 01:19:14.053
I didn't know he was struggling.

01:19:14.097 --> 01:19:15.489
He never told me.

01:19:15.533 --> 01:19:18.144
He never said a word.

01:19:18.188 --> 01:19:21.757
- I don't believe you.
- It's the truth.

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:24.847
He killed himself with the gun
you're holding.

01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:27.806
He told me he loved me.

01:19:27.850 --> 01:19:30.504
Yeah, he told me
he loved me, too.

01:19:31.941 --> 01:19:33.899
We had a plan.

01:19:33.943 --> 01:19:35.553
A future.

01:19:35.596 --> 01:19:38.469
But he did it anyway.

01:19:38.512 --> 01:19:40.123
- You're a liar.
- No, wait, please.

01:19:40.166 --> 01:19:43.343
Just listen to me.

01:19:43.387 --> 01:19:44.954
When I came home

01:19:44.997 --> 01:19:46.477
I found the manuscript.

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.696
What, so you just took it?

01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:50.524
Yeah!

01:19:50.568 --> 01:19:52.788
That's his, that belongs to him.

01:19:54.093 --> 01:19:55.965
He left me.

01:19:57.140 --> 01:19:59.838
And he left you.

01:19:59.882 --> 01:20:01.492
I don't owe him

01:20:01.535 --> 01:20:03.407
a damn thing.

01:20:05.452 --> 01:20:07.454
I was angry...

01:20:07.498 --> 01:20:09.848
a-and alone.

01:20:09.892 --> 01:20:12.546
But I didn't kill him.

01:20:15.245 --> 01:20:17.856
But you were gonna kill me.

01:20:24.167 --> 01:20:25.472
Sign it.

01:20:27.039 --> 01:20:28.649
I said sign it.

01:20:30.173 --> 01:20:32.392
It's a confession...

01:20:32.436 --> 01:20:34.481
saying that you didn't write
the book

01:20:34.525 --> 01:20:37.354
and that Paul Walsh
is the author of 'Maya's Fall.'

01:20:39.312 --> 01:20:41.619
Sign it!

01:20:41.662 --> 01:20:43.839
This won't bring him back.

01:20:43.882 --> 01:20:45.405
Shut up.

01:20:48.582 --> 01:20:50.062
I said sign it!

01:20:56.895 --> 01:20:58.854
Now get up and go sit
by the window.

01:21:22.007 --> 01:21:23.530
What happens now?

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:26.533
You shoot me?

01:21:27.970 --> 01:21:29.362
No.

01:21:29.406 --> 01:21:30.886
I'm not like you.

01:21:45.378 --> 01:21:47.163
Have a wonderful life.

01:23:16.295 --> 01:23:19.211
Writing is a personal journey.

01:23:19.255 --> 01:23:21.997
We all have stories within us.

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.781
The trick

01:23:23.824 --> 01:23:25.522
is finding out

01:23:25.565 --> 01:23:27.480
how to share them with the world

01:23:27.524 --> 01:23:30.048
in a way that connects.

01:23:30.092 --> 01:23:31.745
Alright,
I hope you all have found

01:23:31.789 --> 01:23:33.530
some inspiration here today.

01:23:35.793 --> 01:23:37.577
Thank you.

01:23:42.713 --> 01:23:44.584
Jessie?

01:23:44.628 --> 01:23:46.630
Hi, I just wanted to tell you

01:23:46.673 --> 01:23:49.720
that I really enjoyed
your workshop.

01:23:49.763 --> 01:23:51.026
Thank you...

01:23:51.069 --> 01:23:52.636
Beatrice.

01:23:52.679 --> 01:23:54.333
'The Epic Fantasy, ' right?

01:23:54.377 --> 01:23:56.248
Ye-yes, that's me.

01:23:56.292 --> 01:23:57.771
I think your sample's very good.

01:23:59.991 --> 01:24:01.688
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:24:01.732 --> 01:24:03.231
I wish you had shared it
with the group.

01:24:03.255 --> 01:24:05.083
No, I couldn't.

01:24:05.127 --> 01:24:07.085
I'm not that confident.

01:24:07.129 --> 01:24:09.087
I haven't shared it with anyone.

01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:14.266
Well, I hope that changes
one day.

01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:16.442
I know the workshop is over

01:24:16.486 --> 01:24:18.096
but I was wondering

01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:21.012
if you would help me
with my book.

01:24:24.581 --> 01:24:28.628
I-I, I don't
do private consultations.

01:24:28.672 --> 01:24:30.195
Just a bad experience.

01:24:30.239 --> 01:24:31.805
Please?

01:24:31.849 --> 01:24:33.807
I'm very easy to work with.

01:24:33.851 --> 01:24:35.940
I'd do anything you say.

01:24:41.206 --> 01:24:42.816
Well, you've twisted my arm.

01:24:44.557 --> 01:24:46.255
Walk with me to my car?

01:24:46.298 --> 01:24:47.821
You can tell me all about it.

01:24:51.651 --> 01:24:53.392
Okay, so...

01:25:04.751 --> 01:25:06.101
Do you wanna hear a story?

01:25:08.755 --> 01:25:11.976
It's been a while, I might
mix up some of the details.
