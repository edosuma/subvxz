38:19.750 --> 38:21.833
for their guys.
We'll just do their job.

38:21.833 --> 38:24.083
We'll fill the cooler.
You know, it'd be nice

38:24.125 --> 38:25.917
if they cleared their stuff
so we could clean our--

38:25.958 --> 38:28.458
- It's the last day, man.

38:28.500 --> 38:30.292
Where's the love, man?

38:30.333 --> 38:33.792
Every time I have an interaction
with Sierra, there's drama.

38:33.833 --> 38:35.792
You might as well just buy
a ticket--it's box office.

38:35.833 --> 38:37.583
- Kate's just--
- Standard.

38:37.625 --> 38:40.792
- One more minute for that.
- We only have three meals left.

38:40.833 --> 38:44.000
So we should make this our
best lunch--our best dinner.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.667
Like, just 'cause they don't
have high-maintenance standards

38:47.667 --> 38:49.125
like Dean doesn't mean

38:49.167 --> 38:50.667
we shouldn't give them
Dean treatment.

38:50.667 --> 38:52.625
- Exactly.
- We were planning on doing

38:52.667 --> 38:53.833
a really bad service,

38:53.833 --> 38:56.333
so thanks for reminding us.

38:56.333 --> 38:57.792
- Will you go down to laundry?

38:57.833 --> 38:59.458
I think it's getting
a little bit crazy.

38:59.500 --> 39:02.333
- Yes, I will.
- Thank you.

39:02.375 --> 39:04.542
You know the beginning
of a football game

39:04.542 --> 39:06.042
where the coach gives a speech?

39:06.042 --> 39:07.625
I think the coach
would be annoyed

39:07.667 --> 39:09.375
if somebody was like,
"Oh, yeah, Coach, we were

39:09.375 --> 39:11.375
just gonna lose the game,
so why do you even talk to us?"

39:11.375 --> 39:12.958
- I didn't know
you were my coach.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.292
- I'm not; I was talking
to my stewardesses.

39:16.333 --> 39:18.625
I wasn't even talking to you.
I wasn't facing you.

39:18.667 --> 39:21.333
- I just won't talk.
I wish I was dead.

39:21.375 --> 39:23.125
- You're not on service.

39:23.167 --> 39:26.333
- Kate is just here
to spoil everyone's day again.

39:30.542 --> 39:32.125
- Oh, and so you thought
that would help?

39:32.167 --> 39:34.000
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

39:39.708 --> 39:39.917
- Coming up.

39:41.250 --> 39:43.208
- Oh, look
at that slide, perfect.

39:43.250 --> 39:46.750
- Cabling down, pull bow,
pull the bow.

39:46.792 --> 39:48.167
- Okay, you're off.

39:48.208 --> 39:49.750
- Are you going to enjoy
the baths with us?

39:49.792 --> 39:51.167
- Oh, no, I won't be going.

39:51.208 --> 39:53.000
The deck team
will actually take you.

39:53.042 --> 39:55.583
- When do you get a day off?
- Our season's almost over.

39:55.583 --> 39:56.833
- Oh.
- You're our last charter.

39:56.875 --> 39:59.208
- Oh?
- Yeah.

40:05.083 --> 40:06.417
- Snorkeling gear?
- Got it.

40:06.458 --> 40:08.167
- Cowls?
- Check.

40:08.208 --> 40:11.000
- Keys to the Tundress?
- There's also extra sunscreen

40:11.042 --> 40:12.417
in the top of the Esky.

40:12.458 --> 40:14.250
- Awesome.
- And that's it.

40:14.250 --> 40:15.750
- I was thinking of making
you guys a nice,

40:15.792 --> 40:17.917
refreshing cocktail
before you go to the baths.

40:17.958 --> 40:19.333
- Oh, I think that's
a great idea.

40:19.375 --> 40:20.750
- Yeah?

40:20.792 --> 40:22.250
Anytime any charter group

40:22.250 --> 40:24.750
wants to go to the baths
I am ecstatic...

40:24.750 --> 40:26.458
- You can sit wherever
you'd like.

40:26.458 --> 40:28.542
- Because I know they're
gonna have an amazing time.

40:28.583 --> 40:30.458
- Have a good trip.
- And I also know

40:30.500 --> 40:35.792
they're gonna be off the boat
for a solid three hours.

40:35.792 --> 40:38.125
Like, ugh.

40:38.167 --> 40:41.125
[tense music]

40:41.167 --> 40:48.625
♪ ♪

40:48.667 --> 40:51.042
Three out of four cabins
have no toilet paper.

40:51.083 --> 40:52.792
The master trashcan is full

40:52.792 --> 40:54.125
from things from
the night before.

40:54.167 --> 40:57.125
I thought Emily
and Sierra knew better

40:57.167 --> 41:02.125
and would respect me enough
to not just give up.

41:13.208 --> 41:17.167
- Okay, ladies.
- All right, boys.

41:17.167 --> 41:18.500
- All right, man.
- Y'all have fun.

41:18.500 --> 41:20.083
- Catch you later.

41:20.125 --> 41:22.833
All right, ladies, here we go.

41:22.875 --> 41:26.083
- So I know it's the last
full day of charter season,

41:26.125 --> 41:29.000
but this is the toilet
paper situation.

41:29.042 --> 41:31.750
- Where?
- This was in the twin room.

41:31.792 --> 41:33.500
This was in starboard forward.

41:33.500 --> 41:35.667
This was in port forward.

41:35.667 --> 41:41.000
So I want both of you girls
to go and conquer the cabins,

41:41.000 --> 41:43.250
vacuum, get all the spots
off the mirrors,

41:43.292 --> 41:44.833
make sure all
the toilet paper's filled--

41:44.833 --> 41:47.500
all the Kleenex paper
is filled so the boat

41:47.500 --> 41:48.917
looks really nice for when
the guests come back.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.667
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

41:50.708 --> 41:53.708
This is resting
bitch face code red.

41:53.708 --> 41:55.375
Don't make me be the bad guy,

41:55.417 --> 41:58.208
because I can be a very bad,
bad guy.

41:58.208 --> 41:59.958
Then you don't
really need a break,

42:00.000 --> 42:01.792
and I go check all the cabins.

42:01.833 --> 42:03.958
The trashes are full, three of
the rooms have no toilet paper--

42:04.000 --> 42:06.042
like, none.
We don't need breaks.

42:06.083 --> 42:08.375
- It's the last day, of course
you don't need a break.

42:08.417 --> 42:10.208
- You're not tired
and the job's not done,

42:10.250 --> 42:11.958
clearly you haven't been
working enough.

42:14.583 --> 42:17.708
- Emily and I worked
so hard this season.

42:17.750 --> 42:19.375
And for her to say, like,

42:19.375 --> 42:22.375
that wasn't good enough,
it's bullsh--.

42:25.500 --> 42:27.708
- Next time on the season
finale of "Below Deck"...

42:27.750 --> 42:30.375
- Yay, tag team, boo-haha.

42:30.417 --> 42:33.583
- This time tomorrow.
- It's gonna be very naughty.

42:33.625 --> 42:36.083
- Yeah.
- I don't rat out my crew.

42:36.083 --> 42:37.417
I'm not done. I'm not done.
I'm not done.

42:37.417 --> 42:39.083
- Okay, well let's
just stop, Kate.

42:39.083 --> 42:40.917
Sierra's not a friend
to anybody; she's selfish.

42:40.917 --> 42:42.917
- Since I'm the chef I'm calling
the shots, Kate, so stop.

42:42.958 --> 42:45.333
I don't care anymore.
- All I asked--all I asked--

42:45.375 --> 42:47.083
- 'Cause I'm gonna do whatever
I want anyway,

42:47.083 --> 42:49.000
so there's actually no point
in fighting me.

42:49.042 --> 42:50.417
- You're such a jerk.
- I don't want to be dragged

42:50.417 --> 42:52.917
in on that situation,
and I won't.

42:52.917 --> 42:56.417
- Do you have a ring?
- Are you gonna propose?

42:56.458 --> 42:59.750
- Aww.
- Oh, my God!

42:59.750 --> 43:02.917
- I don't completely know
where they stand together,

43:02.958 --> 43:04.583
where we stand.

43:04.583 --> 43:07.917
- She brings out
a certain person in me

43:07.917 --> 43:09.750
that I don't want to be.

43:09.750 --> 43:12.958
I don't like working
with you anymore, that's it.
