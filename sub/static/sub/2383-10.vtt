00:00.867 --> 00:02.134
Kids, in the fall of 2010,

00:02.135 --> 00:03.402
I was hosting my
very first Thanksgiving.

00:03.403 --> 00:05.538
And I wanted it
to be unforgettable.

00:05.539 --> 00:09.942
Instead of stuffing, I'm going
to fill the turkey with...

00:09.943 --> 00:11.661
a slightly smaller turkey.

00:11.662 --> 00:14.080
It's called a Turturkeykey!

00:14.081 --> 00:16.248
- A Turturkeykey?
- Mm-hmm.

00:16.248 --> 00:19.085
- Uh-uh, oh-oh.
- Yeah, I was there for

00:19.086 --> 00:22.254
the "insertion".
He used shoehorns.

00:22.255 --> 00:23.422
I'll be having sides.

00:24.424 --> 00:26.058
Your loss.
All right, it's dead in here.

00:26.059 --> 00:27.693
I'm gonna call it a little early.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.378
What? No! You can't go now.

00:29.379 --> 00:31.097
It's the night
before Thanksgiving.

00:31.098 --> 00:32.465
College chicks are back in town.

00:32.466 --> 00:33.933
Their moms just made
a snide comment

00:33.934 --> 00:35.468
about the weight they gained.

00:35.469 --> 00:36.602
They called her a bitch,

00:36.603 --> 00:37.937
but deep down,
they know she's right.

00:37.938 --> 00:39.488
And they're about to walk
through that door,

00:39.489 --> 00:40.890
where we will be waiting

00:40.891 --> 00:44.443
with some light beer
and some rock hard approval.

00:44.444 --> 00:46.812
Wh... what u... up?

00:46.813 --> 00:48.447
Yeah. You don't want
to bail early, man.

00:48.448 --> 00:49.649
You could become The Blitz.

00:51.018 --> 00:52.985
Blitz was a guy
we knew in college.

00:52.986 --> 00:54.387
Sadly, he was cursed.

00:54.821 --> 00:55.855
Well...

00:55.856 --> 00:57.256
I'm calling it a little early.

00:57.257 --> 00:59.558
Wh... you sure?
We got big plans.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.827
Yeah. Remember how last week
we fired up a sandwich,

01:01.828 --> 01:03.529
and we listened to Pink Floyd's
Dark Side of the Moon

01:03.530 --> 01:04.964
while watching The Wizard of Oz?

01:04.965 --> 01:05.965
Well, tonight,

01:05.966 --> 01:08.100
we're doing the same thing,

01:08.101 --> 01:10.136
only with "Weird Al"
Yankovic's Greatest Hits

01:10.137 --> 01:11.937
and Apocalypse Now.

01:11.938 --> 01:13.706
We'll see what happens.

01:13.707 --> 01:17.093
Nah, it's Kraft/Croft night:
mac and cheese and Tomb Raider.

01:17.094 --> 01:18.761
Biz-zow!

01:18.762 --> 01:21.213
You see, every time
Blitz left a place,

01:21.214 --> 01:22.481
something amazing happened.

01:26.286 --> 01:27.453
Oh! I'm sorry.

01:27.454 --> 01:29.088
I thought this was my room.

01:31.575 --> 01:34.894
- Completely naked!
- Completely naked!

01:34.895 --> 01:36.362
Aw, man!

01:36.363 --> 01:37.997
And the movie was awesome.

01:37.998 --> 01:39.532
Aw, man!

01:39.533 --> 01:41.300
At the exact moment
Brando first appeared,

01:41.301 --> 01:43.869
"Weird Al" launched
right into "Eat lt."

01:43.870 --> 01:46.038
Aw, man!

01:46.039 --> 01:47.573
And over the years,

01:47.574 --> 01:49.809
"The Curse of The Blitz"
continued.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.677
Well, I'm gonna call it.

01:51.678 --> 01:54.480
I just got Madden 2K1, and
I can't stop thinking about it.

01:54.481 --> 01:55.514
- See you later!
- Bye-bye!

01:55.515 --> 01:56.549
- All right, bye-bye!
- Okay, later!

01:56.550 --> 01:57.750
- Good-bye!
- Bye-Bye!

02:01.254 --> 02:03.723
Tap's broke!
Can't turn 'em off!

02:03.724 --> 02:05.224
Free beer for everyone!

02:07.427 --> 02:09.261
Free beer for everyone!

02:09.262 --> 02:10.763
Free beer for everyone!

02:10.764 --> 02:13.299
Aw, man!

02:14.000 --> 02:15.401
You know what?

02:15.402 --> 02:17.470
Ted, go ahead... leave early
to do something lame.

02:17.471 --> 02:20.473
Just don't blame us
if you become... The Blitz.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.974
All right, first of all...

02:21.975 --> 02:24.810
there's nothing lame
about brining a Turturkeykey,

02:24.811 --> 02:27.079
copyright pending.
And secondly,

02:27.080 --> 02:29.782
I don't believe "The Curse
of The Blitz" is real.

02:29.783 --> 02:32.318
Kids, I'd live
to regret those words.

02:32.319 --> 02:34.253
You see, the "Curse of Blitz"
could be passed

02:34.254 --> 02:36.655
from one person to the next,
at any moment.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.457
Blitz had gotten the curse from
Jerry Windheim,

02:38.458 --> 02:40.893
back in freshman year,
who got it years before that

02:40.894 --> 02:42.428
from Davey Beaterman.

02:42.429 --> 02:43.796
The original Blitz, Matt Blitz,

02:43.797 --> 02:46.165
was a guy who went to Wesleyan
back in the '60s.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.934
He dropped out right before
the school went co-ed.

02:48.935 --> 02:51.203
And then,
Thanksgiving morning...

02:56.276 --> 02:58.177
What the hell happened here?

02:58.178 --> 03:00.246
Hey! Morning, Blitz!

03:00.247 --> 03:02.248
Aw, man!

03:02.249 --> 03:03.999
No, no! Let's get
one thing straight, okay?

03:04.000 --> 03:05.317
I am not The Blitz.

04:04.227 --> 04:05.561
Kids, you remember Zoey.

04:05.562 --> 04:06.929
For the last two months,

04:06.930 --> 04:08.630
she'd been making my life hell.

04:09.833 --> 04:10.966
Thanks, guys!

04:10.967 --> 04:12.468
Last night was amazing!

04:12.469 --> 04:13.769
The Gentleman!

04:13.770 --> 04:15.771
The Gentle...

04:17.574 --> 04:20.942
How could you,
my best friends in the world,

04:20.944 --> 04:23.045
hang out with
my mortal enemy,

04:23.046 --> 04:27.082
then let her sleep in the tub
where I clean myself?!

04:27.083 --> 04:29.067
Sorry, Ted.
We can explain.

04:29.068 --> 04:31.253
After you Blitzed out last night...

04:31.254 --> 04:32.554
I'm not The Blitz!

04:32.555 --> 04:33.789
Oh, my God...

04:33.790 --> 04:35.257
That's Zoey!

04:35.258 --> 04:36.859
That's Ted's enemy.

04:36.860 --> 04:39.361
Which means she's our enemy.

04:39.362 --> 04:42.197
Let's take this bitch down.

04:42.198 --> 04:43.799
Huh? Huh?

04:43.800 --> 04:44.800
Who's got your back?

04:44.801 --> 04:45.834
Now let's have dinner!

04:45.835 --> 04:48.503
Finish the story, Red.

04:48.504 --> 04:51.640
Okay, well, we all
started brainstorming

04:51.641 --> 04:52.975
ways to mess with her.

04:52.976 --> 04:55.544
There were a lot of different
ideas kicking around.

04:55.545 --> 04:58.313
And then I'm just going to leave
her there... buck-naked,

04:58.314 --> 05:01.450
covered in candle wax,
tied to the bed.

05:02.819 --> 05:06.221
Barney, I know that
Ted doesn't like that girl,

05:06.222 --> 05:08.590
but that's a little extreme.

05:08.591 --> 05:10.425
Wait... Ted doesn't
like that girl?

05:11.361 --> 05:12.427
- Okay.
- Wh...?

05:12.428 --> 05:13.629
Well, I got it.

05:13.630 --> 05:14.930
You see that silk scarf?

05:14.931 --> 05:16.999
I'm going to steal it.

05:22.505 --> 05:23.839
Can I... help you?

05:23.840 --> 05:27.176
Yeah. Yeah!

05:27.177 --> 05:29.378
My name is Lily Aldrin.

05:29.379 --> 05:31.847
I'm a friend of Ted Mosby's,
so you better...

05:31.848 --> 05:34.183
You're Lily Aldrin?
The painter?!

05:34.184 --> 05:35.851
Well, yeah.

05:36.586 --> 05:37.619
You're amazing!

05:37.620 --> 05:39.821
I bought a bunch of your
paintings online.

05:39.822 --> 05:41.790
- That was you?!
- Yeah.

05:41.791 --> 05:43.909
Oh! Thanks!

05:44.928 --> 05:47.429
Look, none of us meant
for it to happen, but, well,

05:47.430 --> 05:49.765
we had an awesome night
with her.

05:51.634 --> 05:53.401
The Gentleman!

05:55.288 --> 05:58.707
And then, the craziest
thing happened.

06:03.213 --> 06:04.746
I missed a skateboarding dog?

06:04.747 --> 06:06.648
Yeah, but that
wasn't the crazy part.

06:06.649 --> 06:08.217
It wasn't?

06:08.218 --> 06:09.351
Okay, Marshall.

06:09.352 --> 06:11.303
Truth or dare?

06:11.304 --> 06:12.521
Okay, awesome.

06:12.522 --> 06:14.189
Well, Lily doesn't
let me do truths.

06:14.924 --> 06:15.991
So, dare.

06:15.992 --> 06:17.359
Okay.

06:17.360 --> 06:21.096
I dare you to send
a picture of your junk

06:21.097 --> 06:22.831
to a complete stranger.

06:25.785 --> 06:27.736
Best idea ever!

06:27.737 --> 06:29.905
Worst idea ever!

06:29.906 --> 06:31.990
My junk ended up in
some stranger's pocket.

06:31.991 --> 06:35.477
If there phone was on vibrate,
I basically dry-humped them.

06:35.478 --> 06:38.113
- Ho, ho, ho, ho! Whoa!
- Yay!

06:38.114 --> 06:39.781
- Yeah.
- Okay.

06:39.782 --> 06:41.049
Everybody shout out
random numbers.

06:41.050 --> 06:42.551
- Um.
- 4, 8...

06:42.552 --> 06:44.820
15, 16, 23, 42!

06:44.821 --> 06:46.788
And... send!

06:48.258 --> 06:49.791
Wait. Blitz was there, too?

06:49.792 --> 06:53.061
- The Gentleman!
- The Gentleman!

06:53.062 --> 06:54.796
Oh, I was there
for the whole thing.

06:54.797 --> 06:55.864
Something inside me just said.

06:55.865 --> 06:58.767
"Grand Theft Auto"
can wait a night.

06:58.768 --> 07:00.602
It was legen...

07:00.603 --> 07:02.487
wait for Ted to leave,
'cause he's now The Blitz...

07:02.488 --> 07:04.823
dary.
Legendary!

07:04.824 --> 07:06.108
I'm not The Blitz!

07:06.109 --> 07:07.409
I'm afraid you are, Ted.

07:07.410 --> 07:09.378
You see, when you left
last night,

07:09.379 --> 07:11.613
you changed
the course of Blitztory.

07:17.086 --> 07:20.372
MYSTERIOUS VOICE:
Blitz...

07:34.871 --> 07:37.272
I'm finally free!
I mean, you have no idea

07:37.273 --> 07:39.508
what I've missed
all these years:

07:39.509 --> 07:40.676
The university
president's toupee

07:40.677 --> 07:43.845
being snatched by a hawk
at graduation,

07:43.846 --> 07:45.981
Zeppelin reuniting
at my cousin lra's bar mitzvah,

07:45.982 --> 07:49.618
countless nip-slips,
crotch shots,

07:49.619 --> 07:51.353
shooting stars
and double rainbows.

07:51.354 --> 07:52.721
I've missed them all!

07:53.489 --> 07:55.357
Well, not anymore, Blitz.

07:55.358 --> 07:57.192
My name's not Blitz.

07:57.193 --> 08:00.395
My name is Steve!

08:01.597 --> 08:04.366
Colors seem so bright now.

08:07.887 --> 08:10.205
- Thank you, Blitz.
- What? No!

08:10.206 --> 08:12.341
N... n... n... n... no! N... n... no!
I'm not The Blitz!

08:12.342 --> 08:14.593
The only thing I missed
last night was my best friends

08:14.594 --> 08:17.212
stabbing me in the back by
hanging out with my worst enemy.

08:17.213 --> 08:18.680
Guys!

08:18.681 --> 08:20.115
I hate Zoey!

08:20.116 --> 08:21.883
That means you're supposed to
hate her, too!

08:21.884 --> 08:23.385
Th... that's your rule, Lily!

08:23.386 --> 08:24.720
I tried.

08:24.721 --> 08:25.921
Tried?!

08:25.922 --> 08:27.789
Lily, do you have any idea

08:27.790 --> 08:30.025
how many people
I've blindly hated for you?

08:30.026 --> 08:33.794
I hated Renée Zellweger
with a burning passion

08:33.796 --> 08:35.130
for eight years,

08:35.131 --> 08:37.131
only to discover
you meant Reese Witherspoon!

08:37.133 --> 08:40.235
Hey, I will hate her
until I get my money back

08:40.236 --> 08:41.602
for You, Me and Dupree!

08:41.604 --> 08:43.138
That's Kate Hudson!

08:43.139 --> 08:45.173
Oh, yeah.
That's who I hate.

08:45.174 --> 08:46.575
Guys, we hate Kate Hudson.

08:46.576 --> 08:49.077
No, we hate Zoey!

08:49.078 --> 08:51.913
I'm so furious
at you all right now,

08:51.914 --> 08:54.950
but it's Thanksgiving, and
I have a Turturkeykey to make.

08:56.519 --> 08:58.186
And not that I'm The Blitz,

08:58.187 --> 09:01.089
but could everyone please come
with me into the kitchen?

09:03.259 --> 09:05.227
Okay, I'm, uh,

09:05.228 --> 09:07.062
just gonna preheat the oven.

09:07.063 --> 09:08.897
The oven.

09:08.898 --> 09:10.232
Hey, Robin,

09:10.233 --> 09:12.667
you should dance
on the oven.

09:13.986 --> 09:15.904
Make out with Zoey!

09:15.905 --> 09:19.074
Make out with Zoey!
Make out...

09:25.915 --> 09:28.016
Did they tell you about
the skateboarding dog?

09:29.152 --> 09:31.586
It was awesome!

09:35.271 --> 09:38.007
Great. So not only did
you guys betray me,

09:38.008 --> 09:40.376
but you broke my oven
on Thanksgiving?

09:40.377 --> 09:41.477
Full disclosure.

09:41.478 --> 09:43.412
We also used all your butter,
greasing up Lily

09:43.413 --> 09:46.348
so we could see how far we could
slide her down the hall.

09:47.117 --> 09:49.652
But if it helps, I reached 4G.

09:49.653 --> 09:52.488
It doesn't help. 4G?

09:52.489 --> 09:53.489
Mm-hmm.

09:53.490 --> 09:54.623
No.

09:54.624 --> 09:56.492
What... what are we
supposed to do now?

09:57.494 --> 09:59.795
This is awesome!

09:59.796 --> 10:02.431
I'm part of this!

10:02.432 --> 10:03.732
Barney, I don't know

10:03.733 --> 10:05.801
if the oven is deep enough.

10:05.802 --> 10:09.772
Plus, it's a display
made of cardboard.

10:09.773 --> 10:12.341
Huh. I should probably
disconnect the gas.

10:13.543 --> 10:15.277
Hey, just so you guys know,

10:15.278 --> 10:17.946
there was a tiny explosion
at the sewage treatment plant

10:17.947 --> 10:19.615
across the street
from our apartment,

10:19.616 --> 10:21.517
but I'm sure it's fine by now.

10:21.518 --> 10:22.885
This is awesome!

10:22.886 --> 10:24.019
It's not awesome!

10:24.020 --> 10:27.056
I think the smaller
turkey just tried

10:27.057 --> 10:30.359
to crawl further
inside the bigger turkey.

10:31.728 --> 10:33.562
Um...

10:33.563 --> 10:36.732
Um... I'm have...

10:36.733 --> 10:38.951
I'm having trouble breathing!

10:40.470 --> 10:42.904
Mom keeps an extra
litter box in here.

10:43.757 --> 10:45.574
There you go.

10:45.575 --> 10:47.209
Good as new.

10:48.128 --> 10:50.345
Oh. Hey, Ginger.

10:52.716 --> 10:54.600
Ted, you're not
gonna like this,

10:54.601 --> 10:56.468
but we do have one other option.

10:57.587 --> 10:59.021
Hey, you guys

10:59.022 --> 11:01.123
should come to my house
for Thanksgiving.

11:01.124 --> 11:03.592
My husband always spends
it with his daughter,

11:03.593 --> 11:05.194
so I'm going to be alone anyway.

11:05.195 --> 11:06.779
Could we bring Ted?

11:07.630 --> 11:09.631
It's Thanksgiving.

11:09.632 --> 11:10.733
What the hell?

11:14.838 --> 11:16.789
No. Absolutely not.

11:16.790 --> 11:18.624
Come on. Give her a chance.

11:18.625 --> 11:20.442
Ted, you violated a dead turkey

11:20.443 --> 11:22.161
with another dead turkey.

11:22.162 --> 11:23.912
Don't let that be in vain.

11:23.913 --> 11:25.948
Guys? Wait a minute.

11:25.949 --> 11:27.416
Where's Barney?

11:28.918 --> 11:31.754
And here's the twist, Babaka.

11:31.755 --> 11:36.325
Because Ted left early,
he's now The Blitz!

11:36.326 --> 11:38.560
But Barney,
now you left the group.

11:38.561 --> 11:41.430
Wouldn't that put you in danger
of becoming The Blitz yourself?

11:41.431 --> 11:43.198
No. I c...

11:43.199 --> 11:45.300
Because...

11:45.301 --> 11:47.436
Step on it.

11:49.439 --> 11:50.856
You missed it.

11:50.857 --> 11:51.940
Oh, my goodness.

11:51.941 --> 11:53.242
Our cab took a wrong turn.

11:53.243 --> 11:55.210
We were in the
Thanksgiving Day parade!

11:55.211 --> 11:58.247
Tony Bennett passed Ted the mike
and he sang "Twist and Shout!"

11:58.248 --> 11:59.832
But he's The Blitz.

11:59.833 --> 12:02.951
No. I'm not The Blitz.

12:02.952 --> 12:04.319
I'm The Bueller.

12:05.121 --> 12:06.255
You know what this means.

12:06.256 --> 12:07.923
You're The Blitz.

12:08.691 --> 12:12.377
MYSTERIOUS VOICE:
Blitz...

12:14.364 --> 12:15.964
Oh, God, no!

12:15.965 --> 12:17.382
Life moves
pretty fast, Barney.

12:17.383 --> 12:19.668
If you don't stop and
look around once in a while,

12:19.669 --> 12:20.969
you might miss it.

12:21.538 --> 12:23.305
Chicka-chicka!

12:25.842 --> 12:27.860
Happy Thanksgiving!

12:28.845 --> 12:30.179
Ted.

12:30.180 --> 12:31.713
Zoey.

12:32.749 --> 12:36.485
Best friend alert!

12:39.155 --> 12:42.090
Okay, the Turturkeykey
is officially cooking.

12:42.091 --> 12:43.859
Oh, God, that is disgusting!

12:43.860 --> 12:47.162
Okay, guys,
that's starting to hurt.

12:47.163 --> 12:48.463
No... no, Ted.

12:48.464 --> 12:50.899
Random number guy just
sent me his wang back.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.134
Wow.

12:52.135 --> 12:55.554
You sent a wang out,
and you got a wang back.

12:55.555 --> 12:56.738
It's a boom-a-wang.

12:56.739 --> 12:58.207
- Nice.
- Thank you.

12:58.208 --> 12:59.775
No, I meant the wang.

12:59.776 --> 13:01.577
Barney, could you
get me some more ice?

13:01.578 --> 13:03.679
Sure.

13:03.680 --> 13:05.714
But... no one move
while I'm gone.

13:05.715 --> 13:07.216
I'm scared.

13:07.217 --> 13:08.183
You're safe.

13:08.184 --> 13:09.568
It's okay to leave the room.

13:09.569 --> 13:11.119
You have to actually
leave the building

13:11.120 --> 13:12.254
for something cool to happen.

13:12.255 --> 13:13.755
Thanks.

13:13.756 --> 13:16.625
You're the only one
who's nice to me about this.

13:18.778 --> 13:20.963
Okay, I got to test this.

13:26.302 --> 13:28.103
What happened?

13:28.938 --> 13:30.505
You missed it!

13:30.506 --> 13:32.207
Dude, you walked
out of the room,

13:32.208 --> 13:35.777
the laws of physics stopped
and the laws of awesome tripled.

13:36.713 --> 13:39.248
Aw, man!
You said I could leave the room!

13:39.249 --> 13:41.383
I just wanted to see
something cool happen.

13:42.018 --> 13:43.285
I'm sorry.

13:43.286 --> 13:45.554
But I was on that island
for what seems like eternity.

13:45.555 --> 13:47.589
I'm going to enjoy
things on the other side.

13:47.590 --> 13:49.808
No! Y... you...

13:49.809 --> 13:51.093
Robin, Robin.

13:51.094 --> 13:53.729
I will pay you to be The Blitz.

13:53.730 --> 13:55.814
$100! No... $10,000.

13:55.815 --> 13:57.199
No... 60 bucks.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.268
That's a lot of money
for someone like you.

13:59.269 --> 14:02.371
Dude, The Blitz isn't something
that can be bought or sold.

14:02.372 --> 14:04.273
Yeah, it's not like
Ted's integrity.

14:04.274 --> 14:05.540
Oh, what was that?

14:05.541 --> 14:07.442
I was distracted by
the four-caret diamond

14:07.443 --> 14:09.111
your 53-year-old
husband bought you.

14:09.112 --> 14:10.312
Facial!

14:10.313 --> 14:11.513
Now, if you'll excuse me,

14:11.514 --> 14:13.315
I have a turturkeykey to baste.

14:13.316 --> 14:14.416
I'm coming with you.

14:14.417 --> 14:16.752
No... I baste alone.

14:16.753 --> 14:18.453
Oh, I'm sure
you're a master baster, Ted.

14:18.454 --> 14:20.422
Word play. Loving it.

14:20.423 --> 14:21.490
But relax.

14:21.491 --> 14:22.491
I've got a ton of sides

14:22.492 --> 14:23.959
to heat up since
my plans fell through.

14:23.960 --> 14:25.560
Who canceled? Your coven?

14:25.561 --> 14:27.996
Coven. Group of witches.
Boom.

14:27.997 --> 14:30.666
Yeah. They were worn out from
putting that spell on your hair.

14:30.667 --> 14:32.267
Oh! Serve returned.

14:32.268 --> 14:33.535
Are you happy?

14:33.536 --> 14:34.870
You're ruining Thanksgiving.

14:34.871 --> 14:36.471
Well, you're not exactly
who I thought

14:36.472 --> 14:38.040
I'd be spending
Thanksgiving with, either.

14:39.158 --> 14:41.193
God, I'm so happy to be here.

14:41.194 --> 14:43.478
My face hurts from smiling.

14:43.479 --> 14:45.146
- Oh...
- I'm sorry, Lily.

14:45.147 --> 14:46.782
I'm just never going
to like that woman.

14:46.783 --> 14:48.200
Ted, give her a chance.

14:48.201 --> 14:49.551
Enemies can't become friends.

14:49.552 --> 14:50.886
Yes, they can.

14:50.887 --> 14:51.920
Right, guys?

14:53.873 --> 14:55.323
No, no, no.
You guys can't be objective.

14:55.324 --> 14:56.658
You still feel guilty
about last night.

14:56.659 --> 14:57.726
Well, let's get
an outside opinion.

14:57.727 --> 14:58.760
Who are we gonna...

14:58.761 --> 15:00.495
- "Dear Wang Guy..."
- Oh.

15:00.496 --> 15:03.398
"Can enemies ever be friends?

15:03.399 --> 15:05.000
Just wondering."

15:05.001 --> 15:06.501
Really?

15:06.502 --> 15:09.237
Wang Guy?
We're asking Wang Guy?

15:09.238 --> 15:10.772
He's bold and uninhibited,

15:10.773 --> 15:12.140
so why not?

15:12.141 --> 15:15.410
And guys, you know what?
For fun, why don't we ask him

15:15.411 --> 15:17.179
what he does for a living?

15:17.180 --> 15:19.181
Wouldn't that be fun?

15:19.182 --> 15:20.849
- Just ask...
- Aww.

15:20.850 --> 15:23.385
You've got a little crush
on Wang Guy, don't you?

15:23.386 --> 15:25.787
What? No. Shut up.

15:25.788 --> 15:27.155
I hate him.

15:27.156 --> 15:28.190
Oh, look.

15:28.191 --> 15:29.925
We got an answer.
Here it is.

15:29.926 --> 15:32.995
"Yes, enemies
can become friends.

15:32.996 --> 15:35.697
Remember what Gandhi said.

15:35.698 --> 15:38.467
'Be the change you want
to see in the world.'"

15:38.468 --> 15:41.136
Uh, did Wang Guy
just quote Gandhi?

15:41.137 --> 15:42.871
That is amazing.

15:42.872 --> 15:44.389
And I was here for it.

15:44.390 --> 15:47.376
Now Zoey is The Blitz.
Ha, ha!

15:47.377 --> 15:49.878
Burn on her.

15:51.014 --> 15:52.247
Come on, man.

15:52.248 --> 15:54.082
Don't be that Blitz.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.784
I'm not any Blitz!

15:55.785 --> 15:56.952
You're The Blitz!

15:56.953 --> 15:58.553
You're all The Blitz!

15:58.554 --> 16:01.590
I slept with that cute
Indian girl who cuts my hair!

16:01.591 --> 16:03.458
What does that have
to do with anything?

16:03.459 --> 16:04.559
Nothing! I just forgot

16:04.560 --> 16:07.496
to brag about it before!

16:07.497 --> 16:09.831
Guys, despite the wit
and wisdom of Wang Guy,

16:09.832 --> 16:12.200
Zoey and I are never going
to be friends.

16:12.201 --> 16:15.237
We're just here for
her oven and that's it.

16:15.238 --> 16:16.471
Whoa! Oh, my God!

16:16.472 --> 16:19.274
Did you do that on purpose?

16:19.275 --> 16:20.709
What? No. It was an accident.

16:20.710 --> 16:21.777
Oh, yeah. Well, like this is.

16:21.778 --> 16:23.111
Oh, great. Real mature.

16:23.112 --> 16:24.946
Yeah, well, you started it.

16:26.132 --> 16:28.316
Just stop it!

16:28.317 --> 16:31.653
God, can't you two just
stop fighting for one day?

16:31.654 --> 16:34.823
Like, when the Roadrunner
and the Coyote

16:34.824 --> 16:36.792
clocked out and
had a beer together?

16:36.793 --> 16:39.828
Or... or... or Tom and Jerry
shared a cup of coffee.

16:39.829 --> 16:41.630
Lily, those are
cartoon characters,

16:41.631 --> 16:43.565
and I'm pretty sure
you're making up episodes.

16:43.566 --> 16:46.334
And if Zoey is a
cartoon character,

16:46.335 --> 16:48.503
she's Cinderella's
evil stepmother!

16:48.504 --> 16:50.739
Oh, get out.

16:50.740 --> 16:51.907
All of you, out!

16:51.908 --> 16:53.475
But it's Thanksgiving.

16:53.476 --> 16:55.310
And I'm a part of it.

16:55.311 --> 16:56.745
Out!

16:59.282 --> 17:02.050
Wait... where's Barney?

17:02.051 --> 17:03.835
Hey, guys, the most amazing
thing just happened

17:03.836 --> 17:05.319
to me in that other roo...

17:07.957 --> 17:10.125
Aw, man.

17:13.435 --> 17:15.301
I don't get it.
Why'd she just

17:15.303 --> 17:16.819
kick us out like that?

17:16.820 --> 17:18.472
And then the cab driver said

17:18.473 --> 17:20.607
the last thing any
of us wanted to hear.

17:20.608 --> 17:21.942
Where to?

17:25.079 --> 17:26.946
I guess we're going home.

17:29.150 --> 17:32.653
Yeah. I don't know
where that is.

17:42.163 --> 17:44.431
Lily, where'd you get that?

17:44.432 --> 17:46.500
Oh.

17:46.501 --> 17:47.768
When Zoey booted us,

17:47.769 --> 17:50.237
it made me want to steal
something of hers again.

17:50.238 --> 17:53.891
Apartment full of designer
labels, and what do I grab?

17:53.892 --> 17:57.478
"Happy Turkey Day, Hannah.
Love, Zoey."

17:57.479 --> 18:00.347
I wonder who Hannah is.

18:04.085 --> 18:06.720
Hey, you guys should come
to my house for Thanksgiving.

18:06.721 --> 18:07.821
My husband always

18:07.822 --> 18:08.956
spends it with his daughter,

18:08.957 --> 18:10.557
so I'm going
to be alone, anyway.

18:10.558 --> 18:11.992
Well, you're not exactly
who I thought

18:11.993 --> 18:13.627
I'd be spending
Thanksgiving with, either.

18:13.628 --> 18:15.629
And if Zoey is a
cartoon character,

18:15.630 --> 18:17.798
she's Cinderella's
evil stepmother!

18:17.799 --> 18:19.700
Get out!

18:19.701 --> 18:21.268
All of you, out!

18:23.671 --> 18:25.723
We have to go back to Zoey's.

18:27.575 --> 18:30.010
You gotta throw me
some addresses, buddy.

18:32.714 --> 18:34.882
Oh, God.

18:34.883 --> 18:37.084
What are you doing here?

18:37.085 --> 18:38.552
Barney let us in.

18:39.421 --> 18:40.587
Barney was here?

18:40.588 --> 18:41.755
I was walking around half-naked.

18:41.756 --> 18:43.657
Aw, man!

18:43.658 --> 18:45.793
Wait. Which half?

18:45.794 --> 18:48.112
Look, I'm sorry your
stepdaughter didn't want

18:48.113 --> 18:49.730
to spend Thanksgiving with you.

18:49.731 --> 18:51.365
How do you know that?

18:51.366 --> 18:52.699
I just do.

18:52.700 --> 18:54.268
It must be tough.

18:54.269 --> 18:58.038
It was the first Thanksgiving
Hannah agreed to spend with me,

18:58.039 --> 19:01.875
and then at the last minute,
she changed her mind.

19:02.811 --> 19:04.311
She hates my guts.

19:06.181 --> 19:07.414
I get that.

19:08.383 --> 19:11.585
Uh, you should
hang on to this.

19:11.586 --> 19:13.137
You can give it
to her next year.

19:13.138 --> 19:15.722
Yeah...

19:15.723 --> 19:17.191
Right.

19:17.192 --> 19:19.393
Next year.

19:19.394 --> 19:20.694
Hey, you never know.

19:20.695 --> 19:22.763
People don't
stay enemies forever.

19:24.032 --> 19:27.034
And that's the story of how
Zoey and I became friends.

19:27.035 --> 19:28.068
Cheers.

19:28.069 --> 19:29.570
Cheers.

19:29.571 --> 19:30.604
Before we eat,

19:30.605 --> 19:31.872
we should take a group picture

19:31.873 --> 19:33.307
and send it to Wang Guy.

19:33.308 --> 19:34.408
Ooh. Oh. Great idea.

19:34.409 --> 19:35.342
All right.

19:35.343 --> 19:37.478
Okay.

19:37.479 --> 19:38.679
Here we go.

19:38.680 --> 19:40.614
One, two, three.

19:41.716 --> 19:45.519
Ted, that is the
best-looking turturkeykey

19:45.520 --> 19:46.820
I have ever seen.

19:46.821 --> 19:48.222
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:48.223 --> 19:49.690
Thank you.
Let's just hope it tastes

19:49.691 --> 19:50.691
as good as it looks.

19:50.692 --> 19:52.025
It didn't.

19:52.026 --> 19:54.094
It tasted wrong.

19:54.095 --> 19:55.345
Oops.
We forgot to light the candles.

19:55.346 --> 19:57.865
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

19:57.866 --> 19:59.733
And just as Barney looked away,

19:59.734 --> 20:01.969
it happened.

20:29.230 --> 20:31.932
The Gentleman!

20:31.933 --> 20:34.635
What happened?
I saw it!

20:36.020 --> 20:38.021
Aw, come on, Blitz.
Now it's just sad.

20:38.022 --> 20:40.207
Aw, man.

20:43.677 --> 20:44.994
Oh, go ahead.

20:44.995 --> 20:47.329
I forgot my jacket.

20:47.330 --> 20:49.498
Oh, hold the door!

20:55.071 --> 20:56.739
Thank you, God!

20:56.740 --> 20:59.608
Aw, man!

20:59.609 --> 21:01.076
MYSTERIOUS VOICE:
Blitz.
