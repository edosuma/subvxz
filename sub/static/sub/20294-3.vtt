-SO, YOU KNEW YOU HAD
THE WARRANT.

05:38.300 --> 05:41.333
-SO, IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON, YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M SAYING.

05:41.433 --> 05:44.433
I HAD TO DO WHAT I TRIED TO DO
WHAT I HAD. I'M GLAD Y'ALL
JUST DIDN'T SHOOT.

05:44.533 --> 05:46.167

JUST BE HONEST, YOU KNOW?

05:51.100 --> 05:53.067
INSTEAD OF DOING ALL THAT.
YOU ALMOST PUT THAT CAR
RIGHT INTO THAT BUILDING.

06:01.067 --> 06:02.600
DRIVING WITH
A SUSPENDED LICENSE.

06:02.700 --> 06:04.167
YOU CAUGHT ANOTHER CHARGE
ON THAT.

06:04.267 --> 06:06.300
SUSPENDED LICENSE?
I NEVER HAD A LICENSE.

06:06.400 --> 06:09.067
WELL, WHATEVER
THE REASON WHY YOUR LICENSE
IS BAD.

06:09.100 --> 06:10.600
YOU DON'T HAVE ONE, RIGHT?

06:10.700 --> 06:12.600
SO, YOU'RE GOING FOR THAT
AS WELL AS THE WARRANT.

06:12.700 --> 06:16.367
YOU HAVE A RESISTING CHARGE
FOR RUNNING. OKAY?

06:16.467 --> 06:18.167

06:29.133 --> 06:30.633
AND HE JUST TAKES OFF RUNNING.

06:30.733 --> 06:31.700

06:31.800 --> 06:33.200
-NO USE OF FORCE.

06:33.300 --> 06:34.500
NO, HE JUST LAID DOWN
FOR US.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.567
WE GAVE HIM SOME LOUD
VERBAL COMMANDS, HE LAID DOWN.

06:36.667 --> 06:39.067
AND WE WERE ABLE
TO TAKE HIM INTO CUSTODY.

06:39.133 --> 06:40.567
-FANTASTIC. GREAT JOB.

06:40.667 --> 06:41.800
-ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

06:46.200 --> 06:48.233
-Female Officer:
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.

06:48.333 --> 06:51.200
I GOT MY DEGREE IN CRIMINAL
JUSTICE FROM THE FORT MYERS
AREA

06:51.300 --> 06:53.533
SHORTLY AFTER I GOT HIRED
BY THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE

06:53.633 --> 06:55.600
AND I WORKED IN THE JAIL
FOR A COUPLE YEARS.

06:55.700 --> 06:57.533
I JUST RECENTLY MOVED
OUT ON PATROL,

06:57.633 --> 07:01.167
AND I'M REALLY LIKING
THE EXPERIENCE 'CAUSE EVERY DAY
IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND NEW.

07:02.633 --> 07:06.333
JUST NOTICED THIS CAR
COMING OUT OF THE HOTEL
OVER HERE.

07:06.433 --> 07:09.667
THEY HAVE NO DRIVER
SIDE HEADLIGHT,

07:09.767 --> 07:13.367
AND THEN ONCE THEY SAW MY
VEHICLE PARKED ACROSS
FROM THE HOTEL,

07:13.467 --> 07:14.933
THEY WENT AHEAD
AND TURNED ON THEIR BRIGHTS.

07:15.067 --> 07:17.167
SO, I'M GONNA GO AHEAD,
AND I'M GONNA PULL THIS
CAR OVER

07:17.267 --> 07:18.867

A HEADLIGHT OUT?
-YES, MA'AM.

08:04.333 --> 08:05.833
-IS THAT WHY YOU PUT
ON YOUR BRIGHTS?

08:05.933 --> 08:07.667
-YES, THAT'S WHY I HAVE
MY BRIGHTS ON, 'CAUSE
THE HEADLIGHT'S OUT.

08:07.767 --> 08:09.733
-OKAY, ALL RIGHT. DO YOU HAVE
ANYTHING ILLEGAL, ANY NARCOTICS,

08:09.833 --> 08:11.367
ANY SYRINGES,
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

08:11.467 --> 08:13.067
AM I GONNA FIND ANYTHING
INSIDE THIS CAR?

08:13.133 --> 08:14.167
-NO, MA'AM.
-ALL RIGHT.

08:14.267 --> 08:15.700
PATRICK, DO YOU MIND
IF I SEARCH YOUR VEHICLE?

08:15.800 --> 08:17.400
-I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
IN THIS CAR.

08:17.500 --> 08:18.800
-OKAY.

08:18.900 --> 08:20.400
-SO...

08:20.500 --> 08:23.067
-IT'S A YES OR NO, PATRICK.
DO YOU MIND IF I SEARCH
YOUR VEHICLE?

08:23.167 --> 08:24.767
-THERE'S NOT REALLY A REASON,
I DON'T REALLY SEE...

08:24.867 --> 08:26.167
-ALL RIGHT, JUST GO AHEAD
AND RELAX.

08:26.267 --> 08:28.100
JUST KEEP YOUR HANDS ON TOP
OF THE STEERING WHEEL FOR ME.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.567
-CAN I SHUT THE DOOR?

08:29.667 --> 08:32.133

08:32.233 --> 08:34.067
ALL RIGHT, SO JUST GO AHEAD
AND JUST HANG TIGHT, ALL RIGHT?

08:34.133 --> 08:35.300
-YES, MA'AM.

08:36.833 --> 08:38.567
-THE DRIVER SEEMS
VERY NERVOUS.

08:38.667 --> 08:40.767
HE HAS TRACK MARKS
ON HIS ARM.

08:40.867 --> 08:44.367
AND HIM COMING FROM
THE HOTEL

08:44.467 --> 08:46.633
THAT'S KNOWN TO HAVE
A LOT OF NARCOTIC USE.

08:47.967 --> 08:49.667
WE'RE HOPING THAT THIS
WILL BE A GOOD CAR

08:49.767 --> 08:51.333
AND WE MIGHT BE GETTING
SOMETHING OUT OF THE CAR.

08:51.433 --> 08:53.133
AND AS FAR AS OFFICER
SAFETY PURPOSES,

08:53.233 --> 08:56.533
I WENT AHEAD AND I CALLED
A DRUG NARCOTIC CANINE

08:56.633 --> 08:58.933
AND HE'S ACTUALLY
EN ROUTE TO ME AS WELL.

08:59.067 --> 09:01.633
WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOU OUT
OF THE CAR, ALL RIGHT?

09:01.733 --> 09:02.900
YOU'RE GONNA WALK THAT WAY.

09:03.067 --> 09:03.933
-THAT WAY?
-YUP.

09:04.067 --> 09:05.400
AND THIS DEPUTY'S GONNA
SEARCH YOU.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.333
-PUT YOUR HANDS RIGHT THERE.

09:07.433 --> 09:08.967
YOU HAVE ANY WEAPONS
OR ANYTHING ON YOU?

09:09.067 --> 09:10.300
-I DON'T.

09:11.933 --> 09:13.567
-I WANT YOU TO WALK
TO THE FRONT OF THE CAR.

09:13.667 --> 09:15.233
THE FRONT OF THE CAR.

09:16.367 --> 09:17.733
PUT YOUR HANDS ON THE HOOD.

09:17.833 --> 09:20.067
JUST GONNA PAT YOUR DOWN
TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY WEAPONS.

09:20.133 --> 09:22.067
-SIR, I DON'T HAVE
ANY WEAPONS, I DON'T
CARRY WEAPONS.

09:22.167 --> 09:24.067
-THAT'S FINE.

09:24.133 --> 09:25.867
-I SAW DURING THE STOP

09:25.967 --> 09:28.833
THE DRIVER WAS-- PATRICK WAS
A LITTLE NERVOUS.

09:28.933 --> 09:30.833
OKAY?
-I NOTICED TOO.
THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HIM.

09:30.933 --> 09:34.767
-WHAT HAPPENED AFTER
I HAD WALKED AWAY FROM
THE VEHICLE?

09:34.867 --> 09:38.067
WE HAD OTHER DEPUTIES
UP THERE, BUT, YOU KNOW,
OBVIOUSLY, WE'RE ALL HUMAN.

09:38.100 --> 09:39.500
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT?

09:39.600 --> 09:43.067
AS FAR AS DID HE REACH AROUND
ANYWHERE?

09:43.100 --> 09:44.500
-HE REACHED AROUND.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.067
-OKAY, SO HE DID REACH AROUND.

09:46.100 --> 09:48.200
WHEN I PULLED UP
IN THE VEHICLE?

09:48.300 --> 09:51.133
-WHEN YOU HIT THE LIGHTS
AND STUFF. THAT'S WHEN
HE REACHED AROUND.

09:51.233 --> 09:53.267
-I GOTCHA. AS I WAS
APPROACHING THE CAR.

09:53.367 --> 09:54.667
-HE WAS LEANING
FORWARD, TOO.

09:54.767 --> 09:57.500
-I GOTCHA, YEAH. 'CAUSE I SAW
THAT HE WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS

09:57.600 --> 10:00.400
WITH THE LICENSE AND TRYING
TO FIND HIS LICENSE ALL
OVER THE PLACE.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.267
ALL RIGHT, ALEX, GO AHEAD
AND HANG TIGHT FOR ME, OKAY?

10:02.367 --> 10:03.600
-YUP, NO PROBLEM.

10:06.900 --> 10:09.933
-THE BACK PASSENGER
IS SAYING THAT

10:10.033 --> 10:12.667
WHEN I HAD PULLED UP AND MADE
THE INITIAL TRAFFIC STOP,

10:12.767 --> 10:16.233
THE DRIVER HAD REACHED AROUND
AND PUT SOMETHING IN
THE BACK COMPARTMENT.

10:19.833 --> 10:21.500
-OOH, GOOD BOY.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.267
THAT'S A GOOD BOY.

10:23.367 --> 10:25.600
OOH, THAT'S A GOOD BOY.

10:25.700 --> 10:27.700
-WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NOW,
IS WE'RE GONNA TAKE
A LOOK IN THE CAR.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.233
-YES, SIR.
-AND YOU KNOW WHAT
WE'RE GONNA FIND?

10:29.333 --> 10:31.033
-DID THE DOG ALERT YOU
TO SOMETHING IN THE CAR?
-YEAH.

10:31.133 --> 10:33.467
-IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE ASKING?
NO, I DON'T KNOW.
-YES.

10:33.567 --> 10:35.700
-I DON'T KNOW WHY YOUR DOG
WOULD HAVE ALERTED TO IT,
ACTUALLY.

10:35.800 --> 10:36.967
SO, I'M KINDA SURPRISED.

10:37.067 --> 10:38.900
-ALL RIGHT.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.533
-RIGHT NOW, WE'RE JUST GONNA
BE SEARCHING TO SEE IF WE CAN
FIND NARCOTICS OR ANYTHING.

10:47.933 --> 10:49.300
YAHTZEE.

10:53.733 --> 10:55.233
ONE BAGGY.

10:56.733 --> 10:58.333
LOOKS LIKE HEROIN.

10:58.433 --> 11:01.933
LITTLE BAGGY.
I'M GONNA SEE IF THERE'S
A LITTLE BIT MORE,

11:02.067 --> 11:05.767
BUT IT'S EXACTLY WHERE
THE BACK PASSENGER SAID
IT WAS GOING TO BE.

11:08.067 --> 11:09.867
PATRICK, GO AHEAD
AND STAND UP FOR ME.

11:11.667 --> 11:14.833
GO AHEAD AND TURN AROUND,
FACE THE HOTEL, PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

11:14.933 --> 11:16.767
PALMS FACING IN
LIKE YOU'RE PRAYING.

11:19.067 --> 11:20.300
ALL RIGHT.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.700
YOU'RE GONNA BE UNDER ARREST
FOR POSSESSION OF HEROIN, OKAY?

11:22.800 --> 11:24.100
-POSSESSION OF HEROIN?

11:24.200 --> 11:25.367
-YES, SIR.

11:25.467 --> 11:27.333
-IT'S NOT MINE.

11:27.433 --> 11:28.567
-EXCUSE ME?
-IT'S NOT MINE.

11:28.667 --> 11:29.667
-OKAY.

11:31.700 --> 11:33.067
ALL RIGHT.
-I'M THE ONLY ONE
BEING ARRESTED?

11:33.133 --> 11:34.200
-YES, SIR.

11:34.300 --> 11:35.733
WALK THIS WAY FOR ME.

11:35.833 --> 11:37.833
-IT WASN'T FOUND
ON MY POSSESSION.

11:37.933 --> 11:38.933
-OKAY.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.600
-WHY AM I GETTING
ARRESTED FOR IT?

11:42.700 --> 11:44.667
-WE'LL HAVE A CONVERSATION.
LET'S GET YOU IN THE BACK
OF CAR,

11:44.767 --> 11:46.700
AND WE'LL HAVE
A NICE LITTLE CHAT.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.533
GO AHEAD AND SPREAD
YOUR FEET FOR ME.

11:48.633 --> 11:50.333
BEFORE I PUT YOU INSIDE
THE VEHICLE,

11:50.433 --> 11:52.367
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
ANOTHER SEARCH, OKAY?
-YES, MA'AM.

11:53.600 --> 11:54.600
-ALL RIGHT.

11:56.267 --> 11:57.300
HAVE A SEAT.

12:02.933 --> 12:04.933
-I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
IF IT WAS IN MY CAR, LIKE,

12:05.067 --> 12:07.067
THERE WAS TWO OTHER PEOPLE
IN MY CAR WITH ME. I DON'T...

12:07.100 --> 12:10.433
WHY AM I GETTING CHARGED WITH
POSSESSION OF HEROIN, IT WASN'T
IN MY POSSESSION?

12:10.533 --> 12:11.933
-BECAUSE THIS IS--
-I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.

12:12.067 --> 12:13.833
-OKAY, PATRICK, ARE YOU
GONNA LET ME TALK?
-YES, MA'AM.

12:13.933 --> 12:15.800
-OKAY, THIS IS THE DEAL.

12:15.900 --> 12:18.967
YOU'RE GONNA GO TO JAIL
FOR POSSESSION OF HEROIN, OKAY?

12:19.067 --> 12:22.333
THE REASON BEING YOU'RE SITTING
INSIDE THE DRIVER'S SEAT, OKAY?

12:22.433 --> 12:25.833
I COME UP TO YOU,
AND YOU'RE FIDGETING
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

12:25.933 --> 12:28.067
I HAVE SOMEONE
INSIDE THE VEHICLE

12:28.167 --> 12:33.267
THAT SAYS THAT THEY SAW YOU
WRAP AROUND AND PUT THE HEROIN
IN THE BACKSEAT OF THE DRIVER,

12:33.367 --> 12:35.500
OF THE DRIVER'S SEAT.
-THAT'S PROBABLY
THE PERSON WHO OWNS IT.

12:35.600 --> 12:36.933
I DIDN'T EVEN--
-OKAY.

12:37.067 --> 12:38.800
-IF HE KNEW ABOUT IT,
DOESN'T THAT MEAN THAT
HE OWNED IT?

12:38.900 --> 12:41.367
-OKAY, SO THEN EXPLAIN THIS--
-HE JUST CLAIMED
OWNERSHIP, RIGHT THERE.

12:41.467 --> 12:43.800
-IT WAS WRAPPED UP
IN PRE-TRIAL PAPERWORK

12:43.900 --> 12:46.300
AND A TRAFFIC WARNING
THAT HAS YOUR NAME ON IT.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.400
AND SO THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
GOING TO JAIL.
-ALL THE OTHER PAPERWORK

12:48.500 --> 12:49.967
WAS FOUND IN THE BACKSEAT,
WASN'T IT?
-NO.

12:50.067 --> 12:53.133
YOU HAD AMPLE OPPORTUNITY
TO TELL ME WHAT YOU SAW
INSIDE THE VEHICLE.

12:53.233 --> 12:55.567
-THE GUY I PICKED UP FROM
THE HOTEL IS TELLING YOU
THAT

12:55.667 --> 12:57.967
I HAD DRUGS AND I WRAPPED IT
IN A WRAPPER?

12:58.067 --> 12:59.633
-I DID NOT TELL YOU
WHO TOLD ME ANYTHING.

12:59.733 --> 13:01.867
I'M TELLING YOU THERE'S
TWO OTHER PEOPLE INSIDE
THIS VEHICLE,

13:01.967 --> 13:04.400
IT WAS IN YOUR POSSESSION,
IN YOUR PAPERWORK.

13:04.500 --> 13:05.733
-I MEAN, I'M GETTING FRAMED.

13:05.833 --> 13:07.767
-ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE GOING
TO JAIL FOR POSSESSION
OF HEROIN.

13:10.433 --> 13:12.533
-Officer:
WHEN I WAS AN INFANTRY
OFFICER IN THE MARINE CORPS,

13:12.633 --> 13:14.133
I WAS ABLE TO BRING OVER
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT

13:14.233 --> 13:16.300
A NUMBER OF TANGIBLE
AND INTANGIBLE SKILLSETS.

13:16.400 --> 13:19.400
ONE OF THEM BEING THE ABILITY
TO COMMUNICATE AND COMMUNICATE
EFFECTIVELY.

13:19.500 --> 13:22.800
WHETHER IT'S A TRAFFIC STOP,
OR A DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE.

13:22.900 --> 13:25.067
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE
TO EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE.

13:25.100 --> 13:27.100
AND THAT'S WHAT TRANSLATES
TO THE STREETS.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.267
NORTH 45, LEE COUNTY,
65, 1050.

13:31.367 --> 13:32.800
WE'RE GONNA STOP THIS CAR.

13:32.900 --> 13:35.100
ALMOST RAN INTO THE BACK OF
THE CAR THERE FOLLOWING
TOO CLOSE.

13:35.200 --> 13:40.300
IT'S A BROWN FOUR-DOOR SEDAN,
BEAU AND HANCOCK.

14:15.533 --> 14:18.867

-NO.

14:20.833 --> 14:23.133

RESPECT THAN THAT, RIGHT?

NOW, I DON'T PERSONALLY KNOW,
AND I CAN'T SYMPATHIZE WITH IT,

18:26.500 --> 18:29.767
BUT I DO UNDERSTAND THAT
IT'S A HABIT THAT PEOPLE GET
ADDICTED TO IT

18:29.867 --> 18:31.600
AND THEY CAN'T CONTROL IT.

18:31.700 --> 18:34.300
HOW MUCH DOES THIS LITTLE BAGGY
NORMALLY GO FOR? LIKE, HOW MUCH
DID YOU BUY THIS FOR?

18:34.400 --> 18:36.067

-NO.

18:45.600 --> 18:47.967
-DO YOU ALWAYS GIVE PEOPLE
THAT YOU DON'T REALLY
KNOW RIDES

18:48.067 --> 18:49.800

18:49.900 --> 18:51.400

19:02.633 --> 19:04.833

WITH NOTHING MORE THAN
A MINOR TRAFFIC CITATION,
ALL RIGHT?

19:08.533 --> 19:11.700
THEN YOU GET OUT OF HERE.
JUST SIT IN THE CAR
REAL QUICK.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.433

WITH THE HEROIN AND THE DRUGS
AND STUFF LIKE THAT,

19:18.900 --> 19:20.433
IT'S TOUGH.
-I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO GET AWAY FROM IT.

19:20.533 --> 19:22.833
I WAS SUPPOSED TO TURN
MYSELF INTO DETOX.
-OKAY.

19:22.933 --> 19:27.500
-AND IT'S-- WITHOUT IT...

19:27.600 --> 19:30.467
WHEN IN DOUBT, MAN,

FRIENDS AND YOUR FAMILY

19:30.567 --> 19:32.967

YOU'VE BEEN SUPER HONEST,
YOU'RE COMING CLEAN ON
EVERYTHING NOW.

19:44.767 --> 19:49.100
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GET ARRESTED TONIGHT
FOR THE POSSESSION OF HEROIN.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.233
-Officer over radio:
132 AND BUSH.
