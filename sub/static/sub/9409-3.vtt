Maybe we shouldn't go anywhere.
He's getting fussy.

17:46.138 --> 17:49.694
[ Think ] How's thing?
[ Laughing ]

17:49.694 --> 17:51.611
Oh, he's fine.

17:51.611 --> 17:53.344
[ Think ]
Hurry up, times running out.

17:53.344 --> 17:57.037
Let's go to the Antique Store.
We're just going to look.

17:57.037 --> 18:00.243
[ Think ]
Let's go. Let's go.

18:04.393 --> 18:07.231
[ Laughing ]

18:07.559 --> 18:11.065
Oh, look at that stuff, Mikey.

18:11.392 --> 18:16.356
[ Think ] Where's the clock.
I've got to find the clock.

18:16.356 --> 18:17.196
Cuckoo!

18:19.177 --> 18:21.915
Right up here.

18:22.957 --> 18:25.096
[ Clock Ticking ]

18:25.096 --> 18:29.941
[ Think ]
One minute left, here we go.

19:04.672 --> 19:07.758
[ Think ]
Clumsy fool.

19:08.678 --> 19:11.830
[ Low Noise ]

19:20.339 --> 19:23.559
[ Clock Noise ]

19:32.140 --> 19:33.888
Grab that baby!

19:33.888 --> 19:36.261
[ Dad ]
Michael!

19:41.394 --> 19:43.762
[ Noise ]

19:44.542 --> 19:45.292
Oh.

19:46.983 --> 19:51.018
Michael, how many times have
I told you to stay away from this clock.

19:51.018 --> 19:53.860
You're twelve years old,
act like it.

19:53.860 --> 19:59.651
I am twelve! I am twelve, Dad!

20:00.882 --> 20:02.252
I love you.

20:02.252 --> 20:06.480
Well, I love you too,
but keep your hands off my cuckoo.

20:06.480 --> 20:09.568
Okay, guys. Lunch is ready.

20:09.568 --> 20:14.760
Mom. Mom, I love you.

20:14.760 --> 20:16.015
I'll get Terra.

20:16.015 --> 20:18.491
Who's Terra?

20:32.833 --> 20:37.054
[ Dad ]
Michael, come here.

20:42.437 --> 20:47.988
I think I found the flaw,
the year 1988 is missing.

20:47.988 --> 20:51.580
That's the year Terra
would have been born.

20:51.580 --> 20:53.203
Who's Terra?

20:53.203 --> 20:56.009
Ah, nobody, Dad. Nobody.

20:56.009 --> 20:57.759
Come and eat, you nut.

20:57.759 --> 21:00.374
I'll be there in a second.

21:01.815 --> 21:04.605
[ Think ]
So Terra has never been born.

21:04.605 --> 21:09.610
I supposed there is someway to
go back in time and get her, right?

21:09.610 --> 21:12.716
I guess I probably ought
to do that, and I will,

21:12.716 --> 21:15.539
one of these days.
