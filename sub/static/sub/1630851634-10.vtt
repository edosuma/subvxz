00:18.018 --> 00:19.811
[Joe] Previously on You:

00:19.894 --> 00:20.979
I still believe...

00:21.062 --> 00:23.023
-You okay there, Joe?
-...in The One.

00:23.106 --> 00:26.776
I'm married but to the wrong person.
What if you're the right one?

00:26.860 --> 00:29.237
[Marienne] Juliette told Ryan
that we spent the day together.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.822
Now he's threatening me.

00:30.905 --> 00:31.948
Stay away from her.

00:32.032 --> 00:35.702
[Joe] As long as he's in the picture,
you are always going to lose.

00:38.496 --> 00:40.749
How much do you know
about Love's first husband?

00:40.832 --> 00:44.753
Love has no loyalty
for anyone but herself.

00:44.836 --> 00:47.380
[Theo]
And you've been buried in here, obsessed!

00:47.464 --> 00:49.466
Just move on, okay? She's dead!

00:49.549 --> 00:51.593
Get the fuck out now!

00:52.302 --> 00:54.095
Do you and Joe wanna play
with me and Cary?

00:54.179 --> 00:56.514
-I killed Natalie for you!
-Shut up.

00:56.598 --> 00:57.724
Go.

01:03.521 --> 01:04.481
Fuck this.

01:05.356 --> 01:07.525
-[Sherry] What are you doing?
-Stand back!

01:08.401 --> 01:11.196
You just shot my ear.

01:13.448 --> 01:16.951
She caught her husband cheating
with your stepmom and she murdered her!

01:17.035 --> 01:18.828
Get us out of here, Theo.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.633
[Joe] Shirley Jackson wrote

01:31.716 --> 01:35.595
that suburbia
is where people start to come apart.

01:36.596 --> 01:39.766
I thought I'd escape before
that happened to me, but if I'd done that,

01:40.391 --> 01:42.435
I'd never have met you.

01:44.395 --> 01:45.814
I'm not free...

01:45.897 --> 01:47.941
unless we both are, Marienne.

01:48.024 --> 01:51.986
So I had to. You deserve a man
who does what has to be done.

01:54.781 --> 01:58.493
Right now, I have to save my son
from his mother.

02:00.453 --> 02:04.415
Mr. Mooney used to say
there's a monster inside every boy,

02:04.499 --> 02:06.584
all too easy to feed.

02:06.668 --> 02:10.296
If you make it strong, it will take over.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.465
We can save Henry together.

02:12.549 --> 02:15.260
I just need to get us out

02:15.343 --> 02:18.680
before Love feeds Henry so much
as another bite.

02:24.936 --> 02:26.813
They're saying she moved to Ohio.

02:26.896 --> 02:30.316
Yeah, sure. She left her plants
and the picture of her mom.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.111
It was her boyfriend.

02:33.194 --> 02:36.197
-No. Or maybe she ran away.
-I could've stopped him.

02:36.739 --> 02:41.119
-The last time it ruined my entire life.
-You mean, like, with your mom...?

02:41.202 --> 02:43.413
It made her hate me so much,
she put me here.

02:44.289 --> 02:47.542
So I thought, with Fiona,
I didn't want her to hate me.

02:47.625 --> 02:51.296
For the record, you don't know
how your mom feels. You're making it up.

02:51.963 --> 02:54.174
Hey, trust me, I do it too.

02:54.257 --> 02:58.178
But I'll never actually know
why mine left me here.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.389
Neither will you.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.061
[suspenseful music playing]

03:40.386 --> 03:41.471
[phone buzzing]

03:44.307 --> 03:45.683
[door unlocks, then opens]

03:46.309 --> 03:47.810
-[Love] Joe?
-[door closes]

03:47.894 --> 03:48.728
I'm home.

03:49.437 --> 03:52.315
[Joe] Fuck. If she sees blood, it's over.

03:53.775 --> 03:54.609
Joe?

03:59.364 --> 04:01.032
What are you doing in here?

04:01.115 --> 04:03.576
Looking for a charger. That's the one.

04:08.414 --> 04:11.000
[groans] What a fucking day.

04:11.084 --> 04:14.295
We need to figure out
how we're gonna endgame the Conrads.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.756
-Brainstorm...
-[Joe] Something is up with her.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.050
Also, we need to have an alibi.

04:19.133 --> 04:22.595
-So I did get an Airbnb in Mill Valley.
-[Joe] She's barely looking at me.

04:22.679 --> 04:25.765
Sherry and Cary aren't enough
to throw her this off-balance.

04:25.848 --> 04:27.850
And the bakery, I have an order.

04:27.934 --> 04:31.437
It's a big one, so that'll be good
to keep everything open.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.398
And I had a thought about us.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.275
Is this...

04:36.067 --> 04:38.027
Conrad blood?

04:40.697 --> 04:44.409
-No, that's Theo. He came by the bakery.
-[Joe] Oh, no.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.035
I, uh... He--

04:46.119 --> 04:48.955
Um, I had to...

04:49.038 --> 04:50.999
[Joe] That's what she can't look at.

04:51.082 --> 04:52.417
Poor Theo.

04:52.500 --> 04:55.461
He's still there, in the basement.

04:56.421 --> 04:59.632
[Joe] Fuck. Okay, problem or opportunity?

04:59.716 --> 05:02.260
I'll handle him.
Don't give it another thought.

05:02.343 --> 05:03.303
My epiphany.

05:03.928 --> 05:05.513
I was just thinking,

05:05.596 --> 05:09.475
like, we're gonna be through this
so soon, right?

05:09.559 --> 05:10.601
[Joe] I hope.

05:10.685 --> 05:11.728
-Right?
-Yeah.

05:11.811 --> 05:16.065
I just think it's perfect, so--
To really fucking start a new chapter.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.736
It's time for us
to try for another baby, Joe.

05:20.528 --> 05:21.362
[Joe] I'm...

05:22.447 --> 05:23.990
actually speechless.

05:27.660 --> 05:30.371
I want nothing more in the world, Love.

05:32.123 --> 05:33.499
Yeah, let's do it.

05:39.839 --> 05:42.133
Too bad, tomorrow,
Henry and I will be gone.

05:42.216 --> 05:46.054
Of course, this all hinges
on the only question that matters.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.307
When I go...

05:50.892 --> 05:52.310
will you come with me?

06:15.750 --> 06:16.918
I'm sorry.

06:17.502 --> 06:21.047
Theo, hi, it's me.
Can you call me and check in, please?

06:26.010 --> 06:28.054
I was too harsh when I kicked you out...

06:29.389 --> 06:30.890
but you don't have to--

06:32.975 --> 06:36.020
-[door opens]
-Just let me know you're okay, please.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.072
[Joe] You poor, dumb kid.

06:46.697 --> 06:47.949
I'm so sorry.

06:55.540 --> 06:58.501
-Come on, man.
-He's not coming back.

06:59.752 --> 07:01.212
It's been hours.

07:02.463 --> 07:03.714
Hey, let me see that.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.009
No.

07:07.093 --> 07:11.222
Sher, I took a survival medicine seminar
with a dude who won Season 6 of Alone.

07:11.305 --> 07:14.434
I can't hear you...

07:15.268 --> 07:17.645
because you shot me in the ear.

07:17.728 --> 07:18.855
It ricocheted.

07:18.938 --> 07:21.566
Tell that to the part of my ear
plastered to that bucket.

07:21.649 --> 07:25.153
-Red flag, okay? This is my turn.
-No. No more techniques.

07:25.236 --> 07:27.864
[Joe] Love's right.
They are gonna argue to death.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.866
Marriage brings out the worst in us all.

07:29.949 --> 07:33.369
-That's not fair. Just let me--
-Don't! You've done enough.

07:33.453 --> 07:37.415
-You're... You're hysterical.
-Fuck you! That is sexist as shit!

07:37.498 --> 07:39.500
I am a feminist...

07:40.334 --> 07:41.586
who grazed you!

07:41.669 --> 07:44.797
Oh, you wanna know
what grazing feels like?

07:45.590 --> 07:47.758
-Hey, hey!
-Don't get hysterical.

07:47.842 --> 07:49.594
-I took a seminar.
-Hey, hey!

07:51.429 --> 07:53.764
[Joe] Oh, fuck. I'm gonna need more tarps.

07:54.348 --> 07:56.601
No! [groans]

07:56.684 --> 07:58.394
Oh, my God.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.231
-Cary?
-You didn't graze me.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.067
You fucking...

08:06.152 --> 08:08.905
shot me in the leg.

08:13.701 --> 08:15.077
[phone buzzing]

08:19.790 --> 08:22.835
-Hey, I've been trying to reach you.
-[Marienne] Um, Joe...

08:24.545 --> 08:26.005
Ryan's dead.

08:26.088 --> 08:28.174
-What?
-Mugging, apparently.

08:28.257 --> 08:30.635
Been a few in the area. Guy with a knife.

08:30.718 --> 08:35.264
Seems like this just went really bad,
but the police still interrogated me.

08:36.098 --> 08:38.226
I feel like this is gonna blow back on me.

08:38.309 --> 08:40.978
-I just know it.
-This was part of a string of muggings?

08:41.062 --> 08:43.481
Yeah, but that doesn't mean anything.

08:43.564 --> 08:48.027
-Weren't you with Juliette last night?
-Yes, I was. I have an alibi, but...

08:49.111 --> 08:51.906
I also have a very long history
of being fucked by the system.

08:51.989 --> 08:54.116
A system that was made by and for Ryan.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.743
Can I disagree?

08:55.826 --> 08:58.246
Not about the system
but just about this moment.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.543
I'd love to be wrong.

09:03.626 --> 09:06.671
Listen, the man who hurt you,

09:06.754 --> 09:10.716
who wanted to steal your child...

09:12.218 --> 09:14.428
he is now gone forever.

09:15.429 --> 09:17.723
You shouldn't send the mugger flowers,

09:17.807 --> 09:20.643
but I am saying
this is your life getting easier.

09:23.020 --> 09:25.189
-Promise not to judge?
-No, never.

09:26.357 --> 09:27.858
I'm glad he's dead.

09:32.488 --> 09:36.117
Can I tell you something else
that happened last night?

09:38.202 --> 09:39.954
Love and I are officially separating.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.582
Wait, seriously?

09:44.041 --> 09:47.044
But, like, no, I'm-- I'm so--
I'm so sorry.

09:47.128 --> 09:47.962
Don't be.

09:48.045 --> 09:51.340
We're both gonna be free... very soon.

09:53.050 --> 09:56.804
Why don't you get out of town
while this Ryan drama dies down?

09:56.887 --> 10:00.600
-Yeah, we should.
-Just think of some place you wanna go.

10:00.683 --> 10:02.560
Anywhere. And just go.

10:04.520 --> 10:05.521
Hey, Joe.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.151
Come with us.

10:15.489 --> 10:17.325
I know, I know, that's crazy.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.035
No, it's not, it's not.

10:19.118 --> 10:23.289
You've been such a rock,
and I let myself fantasize about a...

10:24.206 --> 10:27.418
About a simple, happy, healthy family
for a second, and when I...

10:28.169 --> 10:31.589
When I picture that, I picture you.
And Henry, of course.

10:31.672 --> 10:33.883
And I know you said you love me,

10:33.966 --> 10:36.677
but it was in a certain moment,
I get that,

10:36.761 --> 10:39.263
but I realized, I actually, um...

10:42.350 --> 10:43.351
I love you.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.353
I love you, and...

10:46.312 --> 10:48.230
Yeah, so that.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.695
That's probably way too much, too soon.

10:54.779 --> 10:55.655
No.

10:55.738 --> 10:56.947
Marienne.

10:57.907 --> 10:58.949
Yes!

10:59.492 --> 11:00.993
Yes. Count us in.

11:01.077 --> 11:05.206
We'd be crazy not to try after everything
we've been through to get here, right?

11:05.790 --> 11:07.667
We just have to tie up a few loose ends.

11:08.793 --> 11:10.503
I can't believe we're doing this.

11:11.837 --> 11:13.881
I can. It's fate.

11:15.299 --> 11:17.009
Mm. Gotta go.

11:17.093 --> 11:21.138
Bunch of songbirds just landed on me
and I think we're going flying.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.224
[both laughing]

11:25.476 --> 11:27.019
I'll see you in the sky.

11:36.404 --> 11:39.824
You invited me, we have a future.

11:40.449 --> 11:44.995
This will be the last ugly thing
I ever have to do.

11:47.498 --> 11:48.833
[Theo groaning]

11:51.711 --> 11:53.295
Come on.

11:56.966 --> 12:00.219
Love couldn't even finish the job.
So much for a clean break.

12:00.302 --> 12:02.722
The kid knows everything. If he talks...

12:04.390 --> 12:05.975
[groaning]

12:08.477 --> 12:11.147
Finish it. No one would know.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.773
I'm sorry.

12:13.983 --> 12:16.068
I'm so, so sorry.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.111
[Joe] I would know.

12:17.194 --> 12:20.030
Didn't I just promise the love of my life

12:20.114 --> 12:23.117
a happy, healthy, new beginning?

12:26.454 --> 12:28.038
I will never...

12:29.290 --> 12:31.459
touch her again.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.879
You think
this is because you kissed my wife?

12:34.962 --> 12:36.172
It was once.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.259
Oh, you fucked my wife?

12:40.342 --> 12:43.304
What a mess my wife has made.

12:45.055 --> 12:46.557
I loved her.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.979
Why did she do this?

12:52.772 --> 12:56.066
This is not your fault. She fooled me too.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.402
Are you gonna...

12:59.320 --> 13:00.154
kill me?

13:04.366 --> 13:05.785
[Theo groaning]

13:13.667 --> 13:16.629
[Joe] There is a hospital 20 minutes away.
My escape window is closing.

13:16.712 --> 13:20.341
I gotta keep this kid
from blabbing the second he's admitted.

13:41.445 --> 13:42.404
Okay, Theo,

13:43.322 --> 13:46.659
I'm going to give you a little nap,
all right?

13:46.742 --> 13:49.411
Cary Conrad uses this stuff all the time.

13:49.495 --> 13:52.248
So it shouldn't exacerbate
your head injury.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.290
Too much.

14:01.674 --> 14:02.633
Julie.

14:04.677 --> 14:05.803
Julia.

14:05.886 --> 14:07.972
Julia Quinn-Goldberg.

14:49.138 --> 14:52.141
-Who do you think it was?
-Word on the street is mugging.

14:52.224 --> 14:54.560
-[Andrew] "The street"? Name your source.
-I saw a tweet.

14:54.643 --> 14:55.853
From "the street"?

14:55.936 --> 14:56.770
[group chuckling]

14:56.854 --> 14:58.606
[Brandon]
No, we went past the crime scene.

14:58.689 --> 15:01.734
There was a lot of blood.
I bet it was Matthew.

15:01.817 --> 15:04.820
-But why on earth would Matthew--?
-Sherry's blog. They're hiding.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.780
Matthew is insane.

15:06.864 --> 15:09.241
And Ryan reported
on the Natalie investigation.

15:09.325 --> 15:12.328
What if Ryan was asking
too many questions?

15:12.411 --> 15:15.122
Hey, hey, heads up!
Fifty grand coming through.

15:15.205 --> 15:16.957
-Not a fan?
-He's my ex.

15:17.041 --> 15:20.586
[Brandon] What if the only way
to hide the truth was to murder him?

15:20.669 --> 15:23.839
The library fundraiser's coming up.
My boss asked me to work late.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.382
Yeah. He's a gem.

15:25.466 --> 15:28.802
He never complains
when I ask him to stay and lock up.

15:33.557 --> 15:35.476
[Kiki] Not up to your standards?

15:37.811 --> 15:38.729
[Love] Yeah.

15:39.980 --> 15:41.440
Can't all be winners.

15:42.274 --> 15:45.736
Hey, can you make
two dozen bloody-looking ones by tonight?

15:45.819 --> 15:48.614
I'm having my true-crime book club
over to dish.

15:48.697 --> 15:49.531
Yeah, sure.

15:50.282 --> 15:54.870
What's your theory?
I think, his ex, Marienne Bellamy, right?

15:54.954 --> 15:57.498
My lawyer friend said
that they were in a custody fight,

15:57.581 --> 16:00.417
and she seems off, you know?

16:01.168 --> 16:04.129
Her ex becomes all successful
and then when she wants him back,

16:04.213 --> 16:06.882
she can't
and it's, like, crime of passion.

16:08.258 --> 16:09.551
What do you think?

16:10.886 --> 16:13.430
You're all scandal-hungry crows
and no amount of feasting

16:13.514 --> 16:16.350
on other people's sorrows is gonna
make your lives less hollow.

16:23.565 --> 16:24.400
I'm sorry.

16:26.443 --> 16:27.653
PMS.

16:28.404 --> 16:29.238
Right.

16:30.864 --> 16:33.826
-I'll have those cupcakes for you.
-Great. Thank you.

16:35.035 --> 16:36.203
Hey, guys.

16:36.286 --> 16:37.121
Hi.

16:39.415 --> 16:41.250
Get away from me!

16:41.333 --> 16:43.419
-It was only supposed to graze you.
-No! That--

16:43.502 --> 16:45.754
-[Sherry] You just made me so mad!
-That was your pull--

16:46.839 --> 16:49.091
-Hey.
-Hey.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.010
Hey.

17:05.941 --> 17:08.485
-You know, you were right.
-What?

17:10.988 --> 17:12.156
Joe's cheating.

17:18.620 --> 17:19.621
Oh.

17:20.998 --> 17:21.957
Oh.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.085
Love.

17:27.004 --> 17:27.838
Kill him.

17:30.716 --> 17:33.052
He was abusive.

17:33.135 --> 17:35.512
He forced you into this.

17:36.680 --> 17:40.225
I'll back you up. You know I will.
Then you can let me out.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.143
Us.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.521
You can let us out.

17:44.605 --> 17:48.692
Everybody will believe you.
It's always the husbands.

17:48.776 --> 17:53.781
You know, they force us
into these shapes and we break.

17:53.864 --> 17:58.202
But you and me, we're strong, right?

17:59.328 --> 18:00.788
All you gotta do is...

18:02.956 --> 18:05.501
He fucking betrayed you, Love.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.305
You're a fucking monster.

18:20.974 --> 18:24.520
I always knew your marriage was a sham.

18:26.355 --> 18:31.110
But... it looks like the only murderer
in this room is you, Sherry.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.746
I can't believe that you just did that.

18:48.460 --> 18:49.503
[Joe] Unceremonious,

18:49.586 --> 18:51.713
dumping Theo at a loading dock,
but he's safe.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.632
Now there's no time to pack.

18:54.466 --> 18:57.469
It'll be a miracle if I can get us out
before Love gets suspicious.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.306
-Oh, hey, Joe.
-Hey, Lansing.

19:01.390 --> 19:03.725
Hey, Dante, I'm here to pick up Henry.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.854
-Love picked him up two hours ago?
-Yeah.

19:07.563 --> 19:08.397
[Joe] No.

19:09.022 --> 19:11.233
-Oh, great.
-Was that not the plan?

19:11.316 --> 19:12.860
[Joe] No, it sure wasn't.

19:12.943 --> 19:15.779
It was. She texted me
and I spaced, so I'm sorry.

19:15.863 --> 19:17.281
Nice to see you both.

19:18.657 --> 19:19.491
See you.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.120
[Joe] Oh, no.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.428
She can't know.

19:40.220 --> 19:41.680
-Smells amazing.
-[chuckles]

19:41.763 --> 19:43.223
How could she know?

19:44.016 --> 19:45.309
It's roast chicken.

19:46.018 --> 19:49.396
-Hmm. Where's Henry?
-He's asleep.

19:51.064 --> 19:52.733
-I'm gonna check on him.
-No.

19:53.567 --> 19:54.401
Sit.

19:55.068 --> 19:56.069
[Joe] She knows.

20:46.620 --> 20:47.704
[Love] Mm.

20:50.457 --> 20:52.167
Tastes amazing as ever.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.086
-I'm a great cook.
-You are.

20:54.169 --> 20:55.337
You really are.

20:56.380 --> 20:57.756
And I'm great in bed.

20:58.966 --> 21:02.970
Pretty, funny, devoted wife and mom.

21:03.053 --> 21:04.263
It's all true.

21:04.346 --> 21:07.057
Hey, did you check out Twitter today?

21:07.140 --> 21:10.018
A news guy was murdered.

21:11.728 --> 21:12.980
Ryan Goodwin.

21:13.063 --> 21:15.899
I was like, "Where do I know him from?"

21:15.983 --> 21:18.860
So I Googled him, and...

21:20.070 --> 21:22.155
he's your boss's ex-husband.

21:22.239 --> 21:24.783
And I saw him at the library thing.

21:26.118 --> 21:26.952
Where I saw her.

21:28.620 --> 21:29.621
Marienne.

21:32.916 --> 21:34.001
She was lovely.

21:35.502 --> 21:36.962
Stunning, actually.

21:37.921 --> 21:39.756
-Love--
-Do you love her?

21:44.636 --> 21:45.762
I just want the truth.

21:50.809 --> 21:51.768
Oh.

21:57.065 --> 21:58.942
Did you ever actually love me?

22:00.068 --> 22:01.528
The moment I saw you.

22:04.239 --> 22:05.741
I would do anything for you.

22:05.824 --> 22:08.618
I know that you cheated on me
and you lied.

22:08.702 --> 22:10.078
Okay, can we--?

22:10.162 --> 22:12.581
You made me feel like you really saw me.

22:15.208 --> 22:17.044
Like you were perfectly happy.

22:17.127 --> 22:18.045
[chuckles]

22:18.837 --> 22:21.631
You made me feel
like I needed to protect you.

22:23.967 --> 22:27.596
You got so upset
killing objectively horrible people.

22:28.347 --> 22:31.558
So I thought, "He's sensitive.
I can do this for him."

22:31.641 --> 22:33.518
I don't remember you asking.

22:33.602 --> 22:37.105
And then I come to find out
that you are happy to murder,

22:37.189 --> 22:38.815
just for a different woman.

22:38.899 --> 22:41.151
Meanwhile, here I am doing it for you.

22:41.818 --> 22:43.153
A teenager, someone innocent.

22:43.236 --> 22:47.157
Yeah, right. He's just a kid,
who you were having an affair with.

22:48.742 --> 22:53.246
We can do this if you are willing to admit
you have not been perfectly happy either.

22:54.122 --> 22:57.167
We have both made mistakes.

23:00.921 --> 23:02.089
I have made some...

23:03.548 --> 23:04.383
big ones.

23:05.175 --> 23:06.802
And I'm sorry, Love.

23:07.427 --> 23:09.179
I never wanted to hurt you.

23:09.262 --> 23:12.099
I tried, and I know
that you've been trying too.

23:12.682 --> 23:14.434
But it didn't work.

23:14.518 --> 23:18.814
And now we can be honest about that

23:18.897 --> 23:21.483
and deal with this like two adults.

23:22.234 --> 23:24.945
-Meaning what?
-We don't have to do anything impulsive.

23:25.028 --> 23:26.071
What's that mean?

23:29.783 --> 23:31.451
James. James.

23:31.535 --> 23:35.414
What you did to him
when he tried to leave.

23:37.124 --> 23:41.211
-Your mother knew and she told me.
-My mother is a malicious bitch.

23:41.294 --> 23:45.215
All I'm saying is
that we can part ways amicably.

23:45.298 --> 23:47.300
Be there for Henry,
support him, co-parent,

23:47.384 --> 23:49.886
and give each other
the chance to be happy.

23:55.308 --> 23:56.143
Love...

24:00.063 --> 24:01.398
I want a divorce.

24:12.159 --> 24:13.285
[Henry crying]

24:14.077 --> 24:15.287
I'm gonna go check on him.

24:15.370 --> 24:17.664
-Let me get--
-No, I'll check him. I'll get him.

24:29.468 --> 24:33.180
[Joe]
She may come back with Henry or a machete.

24:40.312 --> 24:41.563
Henry's settled down.

24:45.233 --> 24:47.068
You look like you're gonna throw up.

24:48.195 --> 24:51.198
Well, I just said the D-word to my wife.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.742
Okay, yeah, that's fair.

24:57.162 --> 24:58.371
Look, Joe...

25:00.081 --> 25:02.626
I don't like feeling like this.

25:05.921 --> 25:07.923
-I'm so sorry. I--
-No. No.

25:08.590 --> 25:09.508
You're right.

25:11.801 --> 25:14.596
I always thought
that if I did everything right,

25:14.679 --> 25:16.681
life would turn out
the way it's supposed to.

25:17.057 --> 25:18.808
Doesn't that seem reasonable?

25:18.892 --> 25:20.560
I mean, like, with James...

25:21.520 --> 25:23.438
I took care of him.

25:27.943 --> 25:29.319
Doesn't it seem reasonable to think

25:29.402 --> 25:31.154
that he'd wanna be with me
when he got better?

25:32.697 --> 25:33.532
But...

25:35.825 --> 25:38.411
Here's what I need you
to know about James.

25:39.079 --> 25:40.080
My mom was right.

25:41.081 --> 25:41.915
I did.

25:42.999 --> 25:44.125
I did kill him.

25:46.836 --> 25:48.255
But I didn't mean to.

25:51.299 --> 25:54.177
That was my first time using it, and...

25:55.428 --> 25:58.265
the dosage was too high when ingested.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.518
What dosage was too high?

26:01.601 --> 26:02.644
Aconite.

26:04.312 --> 26:05.397
It's a paralytic.

26:06.565 --> 26:07.691
I just wanted to--

26:08.441 --> 26:10.068
I just wanted to stop him.

26:10.694 --> 26:13.196
Keep him in one place
so we could talk it through.

26:13.280 --> 26:16.116
-You wanted to paralyze him?
-Exactly. Yeah.

26:17.909 --> 26:18.743
Temporarily.

26:23.957 --> 26:26.459
Now, you don't have to worry.

26:29.546 --> 26:33.091
This time,
I'm letting it absorb through the skin.

26:38.888 --> 26:41.266
[Joe] Oh, no. No, no, no.

26:41.349 --> 26:43.602
Do I need to point out
that none of this would be happening

26:43.685 --> 26:44.978
if you hadn't grabbed a weapon?

26:48.023 --> 26:49.024
[Joe] Oh, wow.

26:49.107 --> 26:53.028
No one will ever love you like I do, Joe.

26:56.156 --> 26:58.825
It's something to think about
while you're lying there.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.333
[Joe] Okay, this isn't great.

27:09.002 --> 27:10.503
-Love...
-[phone chimes]

27:35.987 --> 27:36.946
[groans]

27:39.032 --> 27:42.744
Apparently, I need
to deliver some cupcakes.

27:45.455 --> 27:48.291
I'll be back in, like, ten minutes.

27:50.168 --> 27:54.172
Then... I'm gonna save
our fucking marriage.

27:57.092 --> 27:59.761
[Joe] What the fuck am I gonna do now?

28:03.848 --> 28:05.809
Theo, come on, answer your texts.

28:06.893 --> 28:10.105
Look, we're mad, that's fine.
But now I'm worried.

28:10.980 --> 28:14.025
Call me back or I'm calling the police.
I'm serious.

28:29.124 --> 28:29.958
Hello?

28:32.585 --> 28:33.420
Joe?

28:37.924 --> 28:39.008
Theo!

28:40.927 --> 28:41.761
Theo!

28:47.350 --> 28:49.144
-Holy shit.
-[Joe] Holy shit.

28:49.227 --> 28:51.146
What the fuck did she do to you?

28:52.480 --> 28:53.857
What's going on? Is Theo here?

28:53.940 --> 28:56.443
[Joe] Thank you.
If I could just get my voice to work...

28:56.526 --> 28:59.779
-[groaning]
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

28:59.863 --> 29:02.532
[Joe] No! Shit. He calls the police,
truth comes out and I lose Henry.

29:02.615 --> 29:03.533
[Joe groaning]

29:04.492 --> 29:05.827
What? What?

29:06.786 --> 29:08.413
What are you trying to say?

29:08.496 --> 29:11.416
-You don't want me to call the police?
-[Joe] Yes! Yes, thank you.

29:13.793 --> 29:14.919
What?

29:19.883 --> 29:20.884
You have Theo.

29:21.926 --> 29:23.052
Uh-huh.

29:23.928 --> 29:24.929
Where is he?

29:26.055 --> 29:27.724
Joe, what did she do?

29:31.144 --> 29:32.645
Where is my son?

29:32.729 --> 29:34.689
[Joe] In the hospital. In the hospital!

29:34.773 --> 29:37.942
You know what Love's been doing
with him, don't you?

29:38.026 --> 29:39.277
You sick fuck!

29:40.069 --> 29:41.321
[Joe groaning]

29:42.697 --> 29:44.616
You took Natalie from me, didn't you?

29:45.575 --> 29:46.409
Didn't you?

29:47.243 --> 29:48.870
Your crazy fucking wife.

29:49.579 --> 29:54.167
You knew, and you sat in my house
and you said nothing.

29:57.295 --> 29:58.671
I should kill you.

30:00.173 --> 30:02.801
I should kill you right fucking now.

30:04.469 --> 30:06.679
-What?
-[Joe] Follow my eyes.

30:06.763 --> 30:09.265
Come on. I'm pointing with my eyes.

30:11.559 --> 30:14.270
Check the search history.
You're a tech guy, you know this.

30:23.905 --> 30:27.534
Saint Benedict's Hospital?
This is where Theo is?

30:28.159 --> 30:30.203
-[Joe] I'm blinking. Yes.
-That what you're saying?

30:32.038 --> 30:33.331
He better be okay.

30:35.959 --> 30:36.793
Yeah.

30:37.293 --> 30:38.253
No police.

30:39.045 --> 30:40.046
No fucking help.

30:40.129 --> 30:44.133
You deserve what Natalie got
a hundred times over, neighbor.

30:47.262 --> 30:49.180
Enjoy whatever Love does to you.

30:52.642 --> 30:54.477
What are you even doing?

30:54.561 --> 30:57.146
The weak spot will reveal itself.

30:57.230 --> 31:00.358
-Weak spots always do.
-Okay.

31:01.609 --> 31:05.029
Maybe we should talk about
what I said when Love was here.

31:05.738 --> 31:06.823
I admire it.

31:07.615 --> 31:12.120
I'm over here trying to save us both
and you've got strategy.

31:14.080 --> 31:16.416
Will you leave the wall alone?

31:16.499 --> 31:17.375
No.

31:18.042 --> 31:20.753
Because whether you love me
or even respect me,

31:21.462 --> 31:23.381
I can figure out a simple cage.

31:23.464 --> 31:28.720
I hacked my body. I hacked the shit
out of our marriage. I can hack this.

31:28.803 --> 31:29.804
[groans]

31:33.683 --> 31:37.145
What was so bad about our marriage?

31:37.228 --> 31:38.855
What are you talking about?

31:39.689 --> 31:41.149
You hack everything.

31:41.232 --> 31:42.942
Ovulation, child-rearing.

31:43.026 --> 31:44.652
Sure. To get it right.

31:45.486 --> 31:47.572
-To be good enough for you.
-That's hilarious.

31:47.655 --> 31:48.573
I mean it!

31:48.656 --> 31:51.451
Or have you forgotten
that you were a golden boy

31:51.534 --> 31:54.537
and I was this uptight grad student
in huge glasses

31:54.621 --> 31:57.415
-who your mom hated.
-My mom hates everyone.

31:58.207 --> 32:00.335
And I loved you in those glasses.

32:01.878 --> 32:06.591
I've loved every version of you, Sherry.

32:08.259 --> 32:11.512
Everything I've done
since the day I laid eyes on you...

32:12.889 --> 32:14.223
it was for you.

32:15.141 --> 32:17.393
-Guess I'm an idiot.
-You're not.

32:18.978 --> 32:21.022
-You're not.
-You know, Sherry,

32:21.105 --> 32:22.774
until I met you,

32:23.775 --> 32:25.985
I had massive inflammation,

32:26.611 --> 32:29.197
undiagnosed lactose intolerance,

32:29.280 --> 32:31.783
and I did coke every weekend.

32:32.408 --> 32:35.912
I was just powering through
until I met you

32:36.496 --> 32:37.538
and I saw,

32:37.622 --> 32:40.875
she's together, she is optimized.

32:42.418 --> 32:44.545
She is so much smarter than me.

32:44.629 --> 32:45.546
Honey...

32:47.340 --> 32:49.842
I didn't fall in love with you
'cause you were smart.

32:52.011 --> 32:53.221
Ow, ow.

32:53.304 --> 32:55.014
Oh, sweetie.

32:55.098 --> 32:56.349
Come here, come here.

32:58.101 --> 32:59.185
That's okay.

33:00.770 --> 33:01.813
That's okay.

33:03.272 --> 33:05.942
-The truth came out.
-No, no, I wasn't even...

33:06.025 --> 33:07.777
You are smart.

33:08.528 --> 33:10.488
I just mean, I fell for...

33:11.656 --> 33:13.866
sweet and brave...

33:15.201 --> 33:16.995
slay-any-dragon...

33:18.454 --> 33:22.125
smart-enough-to-know-that-I'm-smarter-
but-you-don't-mind-that.

33:25.128 --> 33:26.254
I love that.

33:26.337 --> 33:30.425
You're the best dad to the best kids.

33:30.508 --> 33:32.677
And don't forget 6% body fat.

33:32.760 --> 33:35.638
You're down to--? Jesus.

33:36.764 --> 33:40.184
When we get out of here,
you're gonna have all the burgers.

33:40.268 --> 33:43.438
And you'll be the hottest
one-eared bitch in Madre Linda.

33:48.901 --> 33:50.153
[door opens]

33:58.536 --> 34:01.330
[whispering] Hey.
I'm gonna put him to bed, he's asleep.

34:06.961 --> 34:11.591
[Joe] This is not
how I imagined this ending.

34:12.091 --> 34:13.176
Us ending.

34:13.926 --> 34:14.761
Me.

34:21.559 --> 34:23.519
Perfect. I got here just in time.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.105
Okay.

34:27.690 --> 34:28.983
Don't you worry, Joe.

34:29.817 --> 34:31.527
It's gonna be over real soon.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.324
[knocking on door]

34:42.038 --> 34:43.915
Oh, hey, I--

34:43.998 --> 34:46.959
Got a text from Joe? That was me.

34:49.337 --> 34:50.171
Come in?

34:51.631 --> 34:54.175
-Yeah, no. I should--
-If you have any self-respect,

34:54.258 --> 34:56.135
you'll come in,
so we can speak like adults.

35:00.306 --> 35:01.599
Okay, sure.

35:08.898 --> 35:11.275
[Joe] Don't fall for it.
She's gonna kill you.

35:11.359 --> 35:13.152
We'll only have this conversation once.

35:13.945 --> 35:16.864
But I need to know,
of all the men in Madre Linda,

35:16.948 --> 35:18.199
why my husband?

35:18.908 --> 35:21.828
Fuck. He told me
that you two are separating--

35:21.911 --> 35:24.163
He did? Oh. That's news to me.

35:25.206 --> 35:26.916
-I am sorry. What?
-He lied.

35:28.668 --> 35:30.253
[Joe] Get out. Get out.

35:30.336 --> 35:33.089
I'm so sorry. I--

35:34.173 --> 35:36.425
He told me you two were splitting. I--

35:36.509 --> 35:38.219
I really never would have...

35:39.428 --> 35:41.681
Look, I'm-- I'm a good person.

35:41.764 --> 35:43.933
Or maybe I'm not, but I am trying.

35:44.016 --> 35:46.102
You didn't answer my question.

35:47.436 --> 35:48.437
Why Joe?

35:51.149 --> 35:52.525
Was he kind to you?

35:56.654 --> 35:58.281
Effortlessly get you?

35:59.740 --> 36:01.659
Smart? Deep?

36:03.161 --> 36:05.037
Good father material?

36:06.831 --> 36:07.665
Yes.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.711
-At first.
-What's that supposed to mean?

36:11.794 --> 36:13.045
I should've trusted my gut.

36:13.129 --> 36:16.299
Something in me knew
that it was too good to be true,

36:16.382 --> 36:17.216
but I just...

36:17.967 --> 36:19.010
He convinced me.

36:19.552 --> 36:21.888
I let him convince me.

36:22.597 --> 36:26.601
I used to think that toxic men looked
at me and saw an easy mark.

36:26.684 --> 36:28.144
And I've looked at myself...

36:29.437 --> 36:31.981
and something in me
that's attracted to toxicity.

36:32.064 --> 36:35.401
[Joe]
No, don't throw yourself under the bus.

36:35.484 --> 36:36.986
She's distorting things.

36:37.737 --> 36:39.030
[Love] "Toxic"?

36:40.156 --> 36:43.159
What if I told you
Joe's the one who killed your ex?

36:45.661 --> 36:47.038
No, Ryan was--

36:48.414 --> 36:49.790
No, Ryan was mugged.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.085
Uh-huh.

36:56.297 --> 36:57.632
[Marienne] Why would--?

36:57.715 --> 37:00.009
-Why would Joe...?
-[Joe] To protect you.

37:00.092 --> 37:01.344
Because he's obsessed with you.

37:01.427 --> 37:04.180
[Joe] No, I saved you. I did a good thing.

37:04.263 --> 37:06.557
When he's obsessed with someone,
he'll do anything.

37:06.641 --> 37:07.808
I should know.

37:09.310 --> 37:10.853
He was obsessed with me...

37:12.021 --> 37:13.105
until he met you.

37:13.189 --> 37:14.565
-[door opens]
-[Juliette] Mom?

37:15.691 --> 37:17.151
-[Marienne] Hey.
-I have to pee.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.487
Okay, sweetie. I'm almost done, okay?

37:19.570 --> 37:21.030
Give me five minutes.

37:21.572 --> 37:25.618
Oh, you know what?
You can go use the restroom down the hall.

37:25.701 --> 37:26.535
Yeah.

37:28.663 --> 37:30.331
Yeah. Okay.

37:30.414 --> 37:31.540
Come on, baby.

37:32.625 --> 37:33.751
[door closes]

37:35.711 --> 37:36.545
Hi.

37:37.463 --> 37:39.465
[Marienne] Go straight in there,
around the corner.

37:42.426 --> 37:44.262
[Joe] Look this way. Look. Come on.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.097
Shit.

37:53.688 --> 37:54.772
Marienne?

37:57.566 --> 37:58.567
Um...

37:59.235 --> 38:03.072
You... and your beautiful daughter,
you need to run.

38:04.532 --> 38:05.866
Disappear.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.785
Ryan's the beginning of what he'll do.

38:07.868 --> 38:09.578
[Joe] Say you don't believe her.

38:09.662 --> 38:12.081
Say you love me, you trust me.

38:12.790 --> 38:14.709
Then why aren't you running too?

38:17.086 --> 38:18.546
It's not that simple for me.

38:19.588 --> 38:20.423
No.

38:21.257 --> 38:24.844
Okay, listen to me,
maybe it's not my place,

38:24.927 --> 38:29.223
but maybe you think you owe it to your kid
or you're clinging to when things worked,

38:29.307 --> 38:31.767
but, please, if there is ever...

38:32.893 --> 38:35.438
even for a fleeting moment,

38:35.521 --> 38:37.481
a tiny voice in your head,

38:37.565 --> 38:40.359
and that tiny voice is telling you,
"I deserve better"...

38:41.569 --> 38:42.695
listen to her.

38:44.405 --> 38:45.698
That's your partner.

38:46.615 --> 38:48.659
That's your real, true love.

38:49.785 --> 38:52.913
And if you betray her long enough,
you will lose her.

38:55.791 --> 38:58.336
Trust me, I'm still trying
to get mine back.

39:04.592 --> 39:05.426
[Juliette] Mom?

39:07.261 --> 39:08.554
Hey, baby.

39:09.013 --> 39:10.056
Hey.

39:11.766 --> 39:13.809
-Thank you.
-[Love] Of course.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.984
[Marienne] You ready? Okay, come on.

39:22.860 --> 39:24.862
[Joe] Did you believe Love's lies?

39:24.945 --> 39:27.615
You knew it was a trap.
You would've said anything to get out.

39:27.698 --> 39:31.869
-A luxury I don't seem to have.
-[door opens, then closes]

39:38.626 --> 39:40.127
I'd see why you like her.

39:41.712 --> 39:42.546
Tough.

39:43.714 --> 39:45.424
She's got a cute kid.

39:45.508 --> 39:49.595
I can't believe I almost took
that little girl's mother away from her.

39:50.304 --> 39:52.515
The insanity you drive me to, Joe.

39:53.557 --> 39:56.435
Marienne's gonna be fine. More than fine.

39:56.519 --> 39:58.979
She really makes being
a single mother look good.

40:00.689 --> 40:01.524
Noble.

40:05.694 --> 40:08.114
I barely recognize myself anymore.

40:09.323 --> 40:10.449
I was so...

40:12.076 --> 40:13.327
excited.

40:14.537 --> 40:15.704
To be a mother.

40:18.082 --> 40:19.083
And your wife.

40:20.543 --> 40:22.378
And as soon as I became that...

40:23.838 --> 40:25.589
you punished me for it.

40:27.758 --> 40:31.804
I mean, you gaslit me so fucking hard.

40:33.556 --> 40:35.224
I started to question...

40:36.350 --> 40:38.936
every single thing about myself.

40:48.863 --> 40:52.074
But that little voice
in the back of my head

40:52.158 --> 40:55.453
that I've been suppressing
this whole fucking time, it was right.

41:01.250 --> 41:02.751
I'm not the problem.

41:04.503 --> 41:06.255
My husband is the problem.

41:06.338 --> 41:07.798
[suspenseful music playing]

41:16.307 --> 41:18.350
-[screams]
-[Joe] Aconite, when injected directly,

41:18.434 --> 41:21.812
burns as it moves
through the system to the heart.

41:21.896 --> 41:23.564
Think less slow paralysis,

41:23.647 --> 41:26.192
more total fucking agony.

41:26.692 --> 41:28.652
I'm sorry it had to come to this.

41:28.736 --> 41:32.198
Did you really think
that I wouldn't start to wonder...

41:35.326 --> 41:37.036
what you were growing in the garden?

41:41.499 --> 41:42.958
Wolf's-bane.

41:43.042 --> 41:45.085
-A paralytic.
-No.

41:45.169 --> 41:46.504
It slows the heart.

41:46.587 --> 41:48.756
So I Googled antidotes.

41:48.839 --> 41:51.467
Turns out, I needed biohacking.
Adrenaline.

41:51.550 --> 41:54.178
And who doesn't have that
around here, right?

41:54.261 --> 41:56.931
A little voice in my head
told me to take it.

41:58.849 --> 42:00.684
Before you played your hand.

42:00.768 --> 42:01.977
[Henry crying]

42:07.650 --> 42:08.734
Joe...

42:10.653 --> 42:11.862
You did this to yourself.

42:14.907 --> 42:19.578
And the hardest part was making
the dose because I couldn't lie to myself.

42:21.705 --> 42:23.290
It had to be enough.

42:24.583 --> 42:27.086
I had to finally stop you.

42:28.212 --> 42:30.881
[sobbing] We're perfect for each other.

42:33.425 --> 42:34.301
But bad...

42:36.053 --> 42:37.346
for Henry.

42:39.682 --> 42:44.061
He'll know what you are.

43:05.165 --> 43:09.169
Those sadistic, tacky,
Los Angeles, little bitches.

43:13.924 --> 43:14.842
Hey.

43:14.925 --> 43:17.011
Hey, don't give up on me, baby.

43:17.094 --> 43:18.971
No, baby. Give me a flag, Cary.

43:19.054 --> 43:20.681
Cary, give me a flag!

43:28.647 --> 43:29.607
Sexy.

43:32.735 --> 43:33.611
No!

43:33.694 --> 43:35.112
No, no, no!

43:35.195 --> 43:37.615
No, we're not letting them win, baby. No!

43:37.698 --> 43:39.450
They'll turn on each other.

43:39.533 --> 43:41.910
Those two-faced, vanilla pieces of shit.

43:47.875 --> 43:49.418
There's a key in here.

43:50.544 --> 43:53.005
Those freaky bitches
don't trust each other.

43:53.088 --> 43:55.341
Baby, they're the weak spot.

43:55.424 --> 43:56.759
They're the weak spot.

44:00.137 --> 44:02.431
[Joe] All I've ever wanted
was to give Henry

44:02.514 --> 44:04.516
the best life I could imagine.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.226
But what if Love was right?

44:06.685 --> 44:08.896
Maybe she will take the fall
for this whole mess,

44:08.979 --> 44:10.397
but I'm married to her.

44:10.481 --> 44:12.232
If I go down too...

44:12.900 --> 44:14.526
what happens to our son?

44:15.277 --> 44:17.655
After Dottie's meltdown,
Love drew up papers

44:17.738 --> 44:22.534
to prevent the Quinns from ever getting
near him, but if not them or me, then--

44:23.202 --> 44:26.121
I can't let him get put
somewhere like I was.

44:36.924 --> 44:37.758
Jacob?

44:37.841 --> 44:39.134
Jakey, let's go.

44:44.598 --> 44:46.100
Such a nice day, right?

44:46.975 --> 44:50.354
There's nothing I'd rather do
than be with you, buddy.

45:01.365 --> 45:02.199
Done?

45:04.618 --> 45:05.536
Oh, my God.

45:06.787 --> 45:09.915
-Joey? How did you find--?
-Do you hate me?

45:11.291 --> 45:12.876
-What?
-You think I'm bad.

45:14.628 --> 45:15.504
What I did.

45:16.463 --> 45:19.299
-Joey...
-Mom, what's wrong with me?

45:25.097 --> 45:27.224
I know you try so hard to be good.

45:30.728 --> 45:32.521
Then why'd you leave me there?

45:35.065 --> 45:37.484
And why are you taking care of him?

45:39.153 --> 45:39.987
I just--

45:41.321 --> 45:44.575
I made too many mistakes.

45:45.284 --> 45:48.704
And even though I loved you,
still love you...

45:50.289 --> 45:51.707
I was hurting you too.

45:54.585 --> 45:59.089
Sometimes we need to start over, Joey.

46:00.883 --> 46:01.884
Completely.

46:03.719 --> 46:05.888
[Joe] I didn't have good parents.

46:06.638 --> 46:08.891
But I know what a good parent does.

46:09.850 --> 46:10.851
Protect.

46:11.435 --> 46:14.396
Even if that means protecting from.

46:15.647 --> 46:16.774
I'm sorry.

46:18.025 --> 46:19.151
I'm so sorry.

46:20.194 --> 46:21.445
This isn't forever.

46:24.406 --> 46:27.034
I love you more than anything.

46:28.744 --> 46:29.745
Hey.

Community, prosperity,

into Dante and Lansing's life

54:00.153 --> 54:04.115
That they protect Henry
as if he were their own son.

No, it wasn't fair of me,

yielded custody to Dante and Lansing.

Someday when he's old enough,
he can read the rest of the note.

into the real heroes of the story.

Did you pity me
when you read what happened?

55:43.923 --> 55:47.594
Did it erase the fear she planted?
Do you still think about us?

Can't believe how many people left
New York after the pandemic.
