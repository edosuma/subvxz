00:27.895 --> 00:29.528
Lights on.

01:38.199 --> 01:41.132
Hannah! Breakfast!

01:41.135 --> 01:43.501
Come on!

01:43.504 --> 01:46.304
Okay, so somebody hacked
into the school website.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.339
I used Spanish goat
cheese this morning.

01:48.342 --> 01:50.374
They changed Melanie
R's grade to a D

01:50.377 --> 01:51.709
and Melanie P's grade to an F.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.444
It's got caramelized onions,
heirloom tomatoes,

01:53.447 --> 01:55.813
and basil, because I know
how much you love basil.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.048
Are you even listening?

01:57.051 --> 01:58.416
Yeah, I'm listening.

01:58.419 --> 02:01.719
The Mels are your best
friends, I know that.

02:01.722 --> 02:04.155
Frittata breakfast special, huh?

02:04.158 --> 02:06.357
Yeah, Dad, I'm a vegan.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.192
Ugh, come on, again?

02:08.195 --> 02:10.360
I know, I'm sorry,
but me and the Mels

02:10.364 --> 02:11.729
keep changing our minds.

02:11.732 --> 02:14.098
Okay. Uh, do you want
my oatmeal instead?

02:14.101 --> 02:16.334
I would love to, but I
actually I have to get going.

02:16.337 --> 02:17.969
No, no, no, I could
put it in a mug,

02:17.972 --> 02:19.670
you could take it with you!

02:19.673 --> 02:21.272
No, I have to get going, I'm sorry,
I'm gonna be late. Bye, Dad.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.273
I love you.

02:22.276 --> 02:24.275
Love you, too.

02:26.113 --> 02:30.549
Okay, well, I'll try this.

02:31.685 --> 02:34.619
There we go.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.821
Mmmm.

02:38.759 --> 02:39.857
Not bad.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.793
Not bad at all.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.531
Good morning, Andrea.
How are you?

02:46.534 --> 02:48.699
Maggie, I have a meeting
with the board in 20 minutes,

02:48.702 --> 02:50.368
so can we please
just cut the small talk?

02:50.371 --> 02:52.304
Um, yes.

02:54.909 --> 02:57.408
As you know, the market
for our current product line

02:57.411 --> 02:58.609
is pretty saturated,

02:58.612 --> 03:01.045
so I've been developing
some new ideas.

03:01.048 --> 03:02.246
I should hope so.

03:02.249 --> 03:04.115
You are VP of Product
Development.

03:04.118 --> 03:05.249
What have you got?

03:05.252 --> 03:07.351
Gourmet frozen food.

03:07.354 --> 03:10.555
I want to create an exclusive
new gourmet frozen food line

03:10.558 --> 03:11.722
for the company.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.925
Gourmet frozen food?

03:13.928 --> 03:15.226
Interesting.

03:15.229 --> 03:16.627
I've been researching several
different options

03:16.630 --> 03:18.029
with Doctor Scully at the lab,

03:18.032 --> 03:22.867
and we have focused in on a
chef named Hank Daniels.

03:22.870 --> 03:26.170
He owns a one star Italian
restaurant called Osteria.

03:26.173 --> 03:29.774
There are only six starred
restaurants here in Seattle.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.642
Really?

03:31.645 --> 03:33.878
Have you been
to the restaurant yet?

03:33.881 --> 03:34.946
What was the name again?

03:34.949 --> 03:36.347
Osteria.

03:36.350 --> 03:39.116
Yes, I've been a couple
of times, and it's delicious.

03:39.119 --> 03:40.752
Amazing.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.521
Hmm.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.423
Website needs some work,
but, uh...

03:45.426 --> 03:47.858
Have you spoken to the chef
about doing a frozen food line?

03:47.861 --> 03:51.629
Not yet, I wanted to run it
by you before I moved forward.

03:51.632 --> 03:55.032
Gourmet frozen Italian food.

03:55.035 --> 03:57.034
I like it.

03:57.037 --> 04:00.504
Go back, try some more dishes,
talk to the chef,

04:00.507 --> 04:02.106
see if we can get him on board.

04:02.109 --> 04:04.008
Great. Thank you.

04:34.174 --> 04:35.573
Good morning Hank, how ya doin'?

04:35.576 --> 04:37.174
Good, Bern.
How are you?

04:37.177 --> 04:39.410
Good. Hey, did you know
that your niece is a vegan?

04:39.413 --> 04:40.611
Again?

04:41.415 --> 04:42.813
Again?
Yeah.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.915
Well, she is 15, and I seem
to remember Karen

04:44.918 --> 04:46.217
becoming a vegan for a while

04:46.220 --> 04:48.019
when she was about
that age, so...

04:48.022 --> 04:50.554
Hmm.

04:50.557 --> 04:52.223
Anything new on the
lunch menu today, chef?

04:52.226 --> 04:53.190
Nope. Nothing new.

04:53.193 --> 04:54.358
Just same old same ol'?

04:54.361 --> 04:56.227
It's not the same ol'
same ol', Bern.

04:56.230 --> 04:57.128
It's a classic menu.

04:57.131 --> 04:58.496
Customers love the classics.

04:58.499 --> 04:59.397
Right.
Mmhmm.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.197
Classic.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.432
Yep.

05:01.435 --> 05:02.633
You're the chef.

05:02.636 --> 05:03.634
Yes, I am.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.239
Okay.

05:09.476 --> 05:10.775
Hot behind.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.943
<i>Go ahead...</i>

05:12.946 --> 05:14.712
Veal apple salad.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.380
Great. And Tortellini,
can you take that?

05:16.383 --> 05:18.550
<i>Behind you.</i>

05:26.694 --> 05:28.460
Okay, service.

05:31.231 --> 05:32.897
Hi.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.933
Thank you, very much.

05:40.307 --> 05:41.972
And calling out two gnocchi.

05:41.975 --> 05:42.973
Yes, Chef.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.008
Two carpaccio.

05:44.011 --> 05:44.875
Yes, Chef.

05:44.878 --> 05:45.910
Thank you.

05:45.913 --> 05:47.812
Chef, Katherine Cooper's
here again,

05:47.815 --> 05:50.414
and says your lobster risotto
is still the best in Seattle.

05:50.417 --> 05:52.450
Tell her that, uh, that's
very nice of her to say,

05:52.453 --> 05:53.918
and then comp her dessert.

05:53.921 --> 05:54.919
Yes, Chef.

05:54.922 --> 05:55.686
Okay, how long
on that carpaccio?

05:55.689 --> 05:56.354
Two minutes, Chef?

05:56.357 --> 05:57.822
Good.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.991
Manny, I... I thought I paid
that bill last month.

06:02.496 --> 06:04.528
I'm sorry, but I'm still gonna
need to get that Wagyu beef

06:04.531 --> 06:06.063
delivered today.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.598
Please?

06:07.601 --> 06:10.835
I... I promise I'll... I'll get
you taken care of next week.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.670
Thank you. I... I owe you.
Thank you.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.944
Um...

06:23.417 --> 06:26.083
So, I'll start with the tomato
carpaccio with burrata.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.351
Very good.

06:27.354 --> 06:29.220
And then I'll have the
compressed apple salad

06:29.223 --> 06:31.522
and the prosciutto pappardelle.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.090
Perfect.

06:33.093 --> 06:36.994
Followed by the wild mushroom
pizza and the lobster risotto.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.662
Will anyone be joining you,
Miss?

06:38.665 --> 06:40.598
Oh, no, no, it's just me.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.600
Excellent, I'll bring
your wine out right away.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.836
Thank you.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.407
Oh... uh...

06:51.412 --> 06:54.078
Excuse me, uh, forgive me
for saying this,

06:54.081 --> 06:56.480
but that's an awful lot of
food for just one person.

06:57.718 --> 07:00.017
Yes. I can never decide
what I want to order,

07:00.020 --> 07:01.919
so I end up just getting
everything I like,

07:01.922 --> 07:04.155
and taking a big doggy bag home.

07:04.158 --> 07:08.360
You would be amazed what
you can freeze these days.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.766
<i>One more?
No, two. Thank you.</i>

07:15.769 --> 07:17.334
Hank, it's happening.

07:17.337 --> 07:18.302
What's happening?

07:18.305 --> 07:19.136
She's here.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.104
Who?

07:20.107 --> 07:21.505
The gourmet food guide critic.

07:21.508 --> 07:22.440
Seriously?

07:22.443 --> 07:23.407
Are you messing with me?

07:23.410 --> 07:24.408
Table 12.

07:24.411 --> 07:25.476
How many?

07:25.479 --> 07:26.777
Just one, but it's just like
you said,

07:26.780 --> 07:27.778
she's dressed conservatively
and sitting alone

07:27.781 --> 07:29.113
in the middle of
the dining room.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.915
She ordered two appetizers
and five main dishes.

07:30.918 --> 07:31.949
Seven in total.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.584
Yeah, and that's before dessert.

07:33.587 --> 07:34.785
Any wine?

07:34.788 --> 07:38.055
One glass, a dry Chianti
and a mineral water.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.057
This has gotta be it, right?

07:40.060 --> 07:40.858
This has gotta be it.

07:40.861 --> 07:41.992
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:41.995 --> 07:42.993
It's gotta be it.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.695
Okay, everybody, listen up!

07:44.698 --> 07:47.064
One of the top food critics in
the nation is dining with us

07:47.067 --> 07:48.599
this afternoon.

07:48.602 --> 07:50.768
This is what we've been working
for for the last four years.

07:50.771 --> 07:56.740
So, follow my lead,
breathe, and execute.

07:56.743 --> 07:57.942
I'm gonna get us
that second star today.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.977
Here we go, come on,
let's go, people.

07:59.980 --> 08:00.978
Yes, Chef.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.714
All right.

08:18.799 --> 08:19.997
Hi, good afternoon.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.665
<i>How is everything?
Are you enjoying it?</i>

08:21.668 --> 08:23.601
Excellent. Thank you so much.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.336
Hi there, uh, well, my name
is Chef...

08:25.339 --> 08:26.337
...Hank Daniels.

08:26.340 --> 08:28.439
Yes, I have your cookbook.

08:28.442 --> 08:30.307
Well, that's a great way
to start a conversation.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.243
Um, can I interest you
in a glass of prosecco?

08:32.246 --> 08:33.544
On the house, of course?

08:33.547 --> 08:35.880
Oh, thank you. Yes.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.615
Stan, one prosecco?
Thank you.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.082
Um, I just love your food.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.183
Wow.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.784
But I hope you don't mind
me saying,

08:41.788 --> 08:44.722
I'm having a bit of trouble
following your recipes.

08:44.725 --> 08:47.024
Okay. What kind of trouble?

08:47.027 --> 08:49.660
Well, um, for one thing,
they're very time consuming.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.462
Good food takes time.

08:51.465 --> 08:54.331
Well, not everyone has time
to cook risotto from scratch.

08:54.334 --> 08:57.434
Ahh... Well, risotto doesn't
really take all that long,

08:57.437 --> 08:58.869
it's just 25 minutes over a pot,

08:58.872 --> 09:00.671
and my risotto
is worth the wait.

09:00.674 --> 09:03.774
And the measurements
are not exactly precise.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.043
Your chicken cacciatore
for example,

09:06.046 --> 09:08.312
it calls for a hint of sugar.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.114
What exactly is a hint?

09:10.117 --> 09:12.349
Just that, a hint.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.685
You see, I've...

09:14.688 --> 09:18.088
I feel that good food is more
about feel and taste

09:18.091 --> 09:19.523
than it is about
precise measurements.

09:19.526 --> 09:21.358
That's baking.

09:21.361 --> 09:22.526
That's not very helpful.

09:25.465 --> 09:27.965
No. No, I guess it's not.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.667
So, maybe my book
isn't for everybody.

09:29.670 --> 09:32.369
But you seem to have
an excellent palette.

09:32.372 --> 09:34.171
Let me ask you a question.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.639
Please do.

09:35.642 --> 09:39.310
Have you ever considered
doing a line of frozen foods?

09:39.313 --> 09:40.578
Frozen food?

09:40.581 --> 09:42.713
No. Never.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.048
We don't even have
a freezer here.

09:44.051 --> 09:45.349
It would make your
food accessible

09:45.352 --> 09:47.084
to so many more people.

09:47.087 --> 09:50.254
Excuse me, I... I...
I didn't order this.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.422
I am so sorry, sir,

09:51.425 --> 09:52.590
I'll have somebody come
right away, okay?

09:52.593 --> 09:53.691
Could you please?
Absolutely.

09:53.694 --> 09:54.692
Yeah, uh, miss, miss?
Mr. Daniels...

09:54.695 --> 09:56.894
Oh!

09:56.897 --> 09:57.695
Oh, I am so sorry.

09:57.698 --> 09:58.562
I'm so sorry.

09:58.565 --> 09:59.496
It's alright...
It's all...

09:59.499 --> 10:00.664
Here, let me just...

10:00.667 --> 10:01.632
Yep, that's okay.
That's okay.

10:01.635 --> 10:02.766
I'm so sorry.

10:02.769 --> 10:03.534
It's fine. It's fine.

10:03.537 --> 10:05.169
That's okay, that's okay.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.137
I am so sorry, Mr. Daniels.

10:07.140 --> 10:10.240
Uh, no, no, actually it's okay.
It's actually just Hank.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.876
I'm just Maggie.

10:12.879 --> 10:14.478
I mean, I'm Maggie.

10:14.481 --> 10:16.080
Not just now.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.282
Always Maggie.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.618
Right.

10:20.621 --> 10:24.355
Well, very nice to meet you,
"always Maggie."

10:24.358 --> 10:25.889
Hank, excuse me, Hank.

10:25.892 --> 10:27.257
Uh, it's a bad time,
right now Bern.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.660
Uh, there's a phone call
for you in the office.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.795
It's, uh, it's Hannah.

10:31.798 --> 10:32.896
Oh.

10:32.899 --> 10:34.198
Uh, okay, I'm gonna
have to take this.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.432
Yeah.

10:35.435 --> 10:38.535
It was a pleasure to meet you,
"always Maggie."

10:38.538 --> 10:39.470
You too.

10:39.473 --> 10:41.005
Maybe we'll see you around.

10:41.008 --> 10:41.739
Okay.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.008
Okay.

11:01.094 --> 11:04.162
Hey, sweetheart.
It's me, what's up?

11:06.400 --> 11:08.966
You did what?

11:08.969 --> 11:11.335
Seriously?

11:11.338 --> 11:12.770
It's really not my fault, Dad.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.271
I told you this morning
that someone hacked

11:14.274 --> 11:15.439
into the school website.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.474
No, no, no. You told me
you were a vegan.

11:17.477 --> 11:18.609
And that someone changed
the Mels' grades.

11:18.612 --> 11:19.710
Ahh.

11:19.713 --> 11:20.878
Look, I just changed them back.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.746
No, what happened was,
you got suspended.

11:22.749 --> 11:24.448
If it happens again,
you're out, permanently.

11:24.451 --> 11:25.549
That's it.

11:25.552 --> 11:26.517
Okay, well, what do you
expect me to do?

11:26.520 --> 11:27.851
They're my best friends.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.420
I know.

11:29.423 --> 11:32.656
Look, I just, I need you to talk
to me before you do something

11:32.659 --> 11:35.092
that's going to get you
into trouble, okay?

11:35.095 --> 11:36.326
Okay.

11:36.329 --> 11:38.163
'Kay, come on, let's go.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.999
Okay, uh, Mrs. Hutton
is next door,

11:42.002 --> 11:43.634
I already talked to her,

11:43.637 --> 11:45.169
so if you need anything
give her a shout.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.271
I'm 15, Dad, I'll be fine.

11:47.274 --> 11:49.073
Yes, I know you are,
but it makes me feel better

11:49.076 --> 11:50.941
knowing somebody's around
when I'm at the restaurant,

11:50.944 --> 11:53.043
and that's what neighbours
are for.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.211
I guess.

11:54.214 --> 11:57.047
I love you, very much.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.016
And I wanna know
that you're safe.

11:59.019 --> 12:00.084
Okay.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.085
I love you too.

12:01.088 --> 12:03.253
Okay, good. Now, I gotta
get going.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.089
Okay.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.190
Be good.

12:06.193 --> 12:08.059
I'll try.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.498
Hey, guys.

12:14.501 --> 12:15.365
Hey, Chef.

12:15.368 --> 12:16.934
So, how'd it go?

12:16.937 --> 12:18.702
Uh, my buddy from the gourmet
food guide called

12:18.705 --> 12:19.937
five minutes ago.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.004
Already?

12:21.007 --> 12:22.806
Really, how's that possible?

12:22.809 --> 12:25.342
He spoke to me off the record.

12:25.345 --> 12:28.545
Okay, okay, good, good.

12:28.548 --> 12:30.814
And?

12:30.817 --> 12:33.217
Uh...

12:33.220 --> 12:35.353
We didn't get our second star,
did we?

12:38.525 --> 12:39.924
No, Chef.

12:43.029 --> 12:46.396
I see.

12:51.972 --> 12:55.005
That's disappointing.

12:55.008 --> 12:58.075
Well, I guess one gourmet
food guide star

12:58.078 --> 12:59.910
is still pretty respectable,

12:59.913 --> 13:02.646
there's only six starred
restaurants in all of Seattle.

13:02.649 --> 13:04.948
I guess that's something.

13:10.357 --> 13:13.490
Why are you guys looking at me
like that?

13:13.493 --> 13:15.058
Em, Bernie, what is it? What?

13:15.061 --> 13:16.660
You look like somebody died,
you're freaking me out.

13:16.663 --> 13:17.494
What is it?

13:17.497 --> 13:18.295
Hank.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.297
What?

13:21.334 --> 13:23.467
No, no.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.802
No, tell me we
still have our star.

13:24.805 --> 13:27.204
Our one star. Right?

13:27.207 --> 13:29.106
I don't under... I... I don't
understand. What happened?

13:29.109 --> 13:30.440
What did they say?

13:30.443 --> 13:33.377
They said something about
the service being slow,

13:33.380 --> 13:38.582
and the menu being stale.

13:42.455 --> 13:45.056
It's a classic menu.

13:49.496 --> 13:52.296
No stars, huh?

13:55.936 --> 13:57.835
Okay. Everybody back to work.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.269
Hank, if you need
to take the day...

13:59.272 --> 14:00.838
No, I don't need to take
the day, Brian.

14:00.841 --> 14:02.139
I could cover for you, Chef.

14:02.142 --> 14:03.507
No, you can't cover for me,
this is my kitchen,

14:03.510 --> 14:04.641
we need to prep for dinner.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.176
She's not saying
change the menu.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.545
I know what she's saying, Leo.

14:08.548 --> 14:09.713
Look, I appreciate
your concern, okay?

14:09.716 --> 14:11.982
But I don't need
any help right now.

14:11.985 --> 14:12.783
All right?

14:12.786 --> 14:13.951
Yes, Chef.

14:13.954 --> 14:14.953
Thank you.

14:38.612 --> 14:40.544
<i>The chef's name is Hank Daniels.</i>

14:40.547 --> 14:43.580
He has his own cookbook and an
Italian restaurant called Osteria,

14:43.583 --> 14:45.749
and Doctor Scully feels
that his recipes

14:45.752 --> 14:48.886
will be a great match with our
flash freezing process.

14:48.889 --> 14:51.255
<i>But while Hank's food
is delicious,</i>

14:51.258 --> 14:53.223
the restaurant has taken
a turn for the worse

14:53.226 --> 14:56.860
over the past few years, and
he's taken on a lot of debt.

14:56.863 --> 14:59.963
Which means business is down.

14:59.966 --> 15:00.965
So...

15:02.702 --> 15:04.669
We'd like to make him an offer.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.908
Good morning.

15:10.911 --> 15:12.910
Leo, Em.

15:12.913 --> 15:14.144
Oh, hey Hannie.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.078
Hey, Uncle Bernie.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.480
How's my favourite rebel?

15:16.483 --> 15:17.381
Oh, please stop.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.683
Don't encourage her.

15:19.686 --> 15:22.519
You go up to my office
and do your homework, okay?

15:22.522 --> 15:24.254
What if I worked on
the website instead?

15:24.257 --> 15:27.157
How about you do your
homework like I just asked?

15:27.160 --> 15:28.325
Okay, fine.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.493
Come on.

15:29.496 --> 15:31.162
All right.

15:32.699 --> 15:35.499
So...

15:35.502 --> 15:38.468
Look, I just, uh, just wanted
to take a second and apologize

15:38.471 --> 15:41.038
for my outburst yesterday.

15:41.041 --> 15:45.509
That was not cool, and I promise
you it won't happen again.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.077
Ah, don't worry about it, Chef.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.412
It was a bad day.

15:48.415 --> 15:51.481
Yeah, it certainly was
a bad day.

15:51.484 --> 15:54.952
It's not every day
you lose a star.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.853
But I thought about it
long and hard,

15:56.856 --> 16:00.991
and the way I see it, there's
only one thing left to be done.

16:00.994 --> 16:01.925
And what's that?

16:01.928 --> 16:03.260
Get it back.

16:03.263 --> 16:04.494
That's what I'm talking about.

16:04.497 --> 16:05.862
We did it once before, right?

16:05.865 --> 16:07.497
There's no reason
we can't do it again.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.299
Hank, there's some people
here to see you.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.268
I'm kind of, uh, in the middle
of a pep talk here.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.770
They said it's important.

16:13.773 --> 16:16.341
Okay, guys, get to work.
I'll be back in a minute.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.746
Hey, I remember you.

16:22.749 --> 16:26.216
You're that food critic, uh...
Always Maggie.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.851
You said my menu was stale.

16:27.854 --> 16:29.553
Um... No.

16:29.556 --> 16:30.754
Yeah, you did.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.356
Now, I don't know why
you took our star...

16:32.359 --> 16:33.557
Wait, you lost your star?

16:33.560 --> 16:34.658
Uh-huh.

16:34.661 --> 16:35.726
But I'll tell you this, okay?

16:35.729 --> 16:37.394
We're gonna get it back,
and then some.

16:37.397 --> 16:40.063
Well, that's good,
because I like a hard worker.

16:40.066 --> 16:42.933
And this is not the food critic.

16:42.936 --> 16:44.167
You're not a food critic?

16:44.170 --> 16:45.169
No.

16:45.939 --> 16:47.938
Okay, so who are you guys?

16:47.941 --> 16:49.406
I am Andrea Fitzgerald,

16:49.409 --> 16:52.809
CEO of Flash Frozen Foods
International.

16:52.812 --> 16:55.078
And this is Maggie Young.

16:55.081 --> 16:57.748
She is the one who's going
to save your bacon.

16:57.751 --> 16:59.617
Literally.

17:07.426 --> 17:09.393
We wanna help you, Hank.

17:09.396 --> 17:10.292
Oh yeah?

17:10.296 --> 17:11.728
Help me how?

17:11.731 --> 17:15.332
Help you figure out how to
make your bank loan payments.

17:15.335 --> 17:16.199
Bank loan payments?

17:16.202 --> 17:17.968
Hm.

17:17.971 --> 17:21.304
Bernie, what is
she talking about?

17:21.307 --> 17:24.141
Well, um, ten years ago,

17:24.144 --> 17:27.344
Karen took out a business loan
at the bank

17:27.347 --> 17:29.179
to get the restaurant
up and running.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.781
Uh-huh.

17:30.784 --> 17:35.786
And after Karen passed, and I
began running the restaurant,

17:35.789 --> 17:37.554
we started to get behind
in our payments.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.056
Nothing that we couldn't handle.

17:39.059 --> 17:41.591
But then, the payments
started to balloon,

17:41.594 --> 17:43.293
and after a while...

17:43.296 --> 17:45.395
So, what are we talking about?

17:45.398 --> 17:46.897
How much do we owe?

17:46.900 --> 17:48.098
I'm not... I'm not really sure,

17:48.101 --> 17:51.568
but I think it's
close to 250 grand.

17:51.571 --> 17:55.639
$200-$250,000?!

17:55.642 --> 17:57.874
How could I not know about this?

17:57.877 --> 17:59.309
Because I wanted you to focus
on the food

17:59.312 --> 18:01.278
because you said the business
part makes you anxious.

18:01.281 --> 18:02.846
This makes me anxious, Bernie.

18:02.849 --> 18:04.614
Well, this is where we can help.

18:04.617 --> 18:06.016
What, you... you want
to buy my restaurant?

18:06.019 --> 18:07.250
Is that it?

18:07.253 --> 18:09.619
No, we do not want to buy
the restaurant.

18:09.622 --> 18:10.787
We want to move forward

18:10.790 --> 18:13.690
with some exciting
new opportunities, Hank.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.425
What kind of opportunities?

18:15.428 --> 18:18.929
We are creating a new line
of gourmet frozen meals.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.865
Gourmet frozen food.

18:21.868 --> 18:24.868
How would you feel about a
line of Italian gourmet meals

18:24.871 --> 18:27.904
that you help create?

18:27.907 --> 18:29.673
Is this a joke?

18:29.676 --> 18:31.541
I will never do that.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.977
I am a gourmet food guide
starred chef.

18:33.980 --> 18:34.945
Were.

18:34.948 --> 18:37.948
You were a starred chef.

18:40.720 --> 18:41.785
Hank.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.653
Do you believe in
your restaurant?

18:43.656 --> 18:45.055
Yes, of course I do.

18:45.058 --> 18:47.057
Which is why I'm 100
percent committed

18:47.060 --> 18:48.859
to getting it back on track.

18:48.862 --> 18:50.694
Well, we believe in you.

18:50.697 --> 18:53.396
We believe in your food and
we believe you are the partner

18:53.399 --> 18:56.166
to help us make this line
a success.

18:56.169 --> 18:57.667
You're a great chef.

18:57.670 --> 19:00.403
So, why don't you let me focus
on the business side of things?

19:00.406 --> 19:03.373
I've run a lot of restaurants
before Andrea hired me.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.008
I can come on as a consultant,

19:05.011 --> 19:07.010
and you can use the money
we're offering you

19:07.013 --> 19:11.414
for your recipes to revamp
your restaurant.

19:11.417 --> 19:15.252
How much are you offering?

19:15.255 --> 19:19.122
We were thinking of starting
with a step deal for 12 recipes.

19:19.125 --> 19:20.957
What's a step deal?

19:20.960 --> 19:24.728
We pay you a certain amount
for every recipe you create.

19:27.233 --> 19:30.066
What do you think?

19:30.069 --> 19:31.135
I don't know, Bernie.

19:33.239 --> 19:37.375
I don't think we have much
choice, that's what I think.

19:52.325 --> 19:55.525
Hannah, breakfast!

19:55.528 --> 19:57.594
Morning.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.162
Good morning.

19:59.165 --> 20:00.330
Okay.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.098
So, I combined the oats
with almond milk,

20:02.101 --> 20:04.834
chia seeds, coconut,
cardamom, cinnamon,

20:04.837 --> 20:06.303
a little bit of candied ginger,

20:06.306 --> 20:09.506
and it's got some vanilla
and some grated nutmeg.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.775
Wow, you really went all out.

20:11.778 --> 20:12.976
Yes, I did.

20:12.979 --> 20:15.679
Deluxe vegan oatmeal
for my favourite vegan.

20:15.682 --> 20:18.949
Yeah, Dad, I'm not vegan
anymore.

20:18.952 --> 20:20.917
Oh, come on!

20:20.920 --> 20:21.785
You're killin' me.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.653
I know, I'm sorry, we just...

20:23.656 --> 20:27.057
me and the Mels just didn't
want to come off as fussy.

20:27.060 --> 20:29.693
Okay, tell you what, how about
deluxe vegan oatmeal

20:29.696 --> 20:31.561
for my favourite non-vegan.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.897
You know, I would absolutely
love to, but I can't-

20:33.900 --> 20:35.432
No, no, no, you can't go.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.100
Sorry, I have to go to school,
'cause I'm going to be late.

20:37.103 --> 20:38.635
Eat an apple at least, okay?

20:38.638 --> 20:39.502
Okay. Thank you.

20:39.505 --> 20:40.237
I love you.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.806
I love you too, bye.

20:42.809 --> 20:44.708
Yeah.

20:44.711 --> 20:46.611
Okay, Yeah, well, I'll try it.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.949
It's really good,
you're missing out.

20:56.089 --> 20:59.122
Good morning!
Hank, Bernie.

20:59.125 --> 20:59.889
Morning.

20:59.892 --> 21:00.857
Morning.

21:00.860 --> 21:01.958
You want an espresso?

21:01.961 --> 21:03.560
Oh, no, thank you.
I already had mine.

21:03.563 --> 21:06.263
I just have some paperwork
for you to sign.

21:06.266 --> 21:07.764
Yeah, sure.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.866
I'll, uh, I'll have my lawyer
take a look at it.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.067
Good idea.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.569
Do you have somewhere
I can set up my laptop?

21:12.572 --> 21:14.904
Hmm, no, not really.
Just my office.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.874
That'll do fine.
Thank you.

21:20.546 --> 21:21.678
That's the bathroom.

21:21.681 --> 21:23.313
Yep.

21:23.316 --> 21:24.682
Mm-hmm.

21:26.019 --> 21:29.887
Well, looks like your office
is now her office.

22:25.378 --> 22:28.478
I see you found my
accounting system.

22:28.481 --> 22:30.580
Throw it in a drawer
and forget about it?

22:30.583 --> 22:32.282
Yeah, pretty much.

22:32.285 --> 22:35.251
I don't really have a head
for numbers.

22:35.254 --> 22:37.387
Then why are you managing
the restaurant?

22:37.390 --> 22:40.590
My sister, Karen, used to
handle all the business stuff.

22:40.593 --> 22:42.359
I was perfectly happy
being behind the bar,

22:42.362 --> 22:44.561
I loved being behind the bar.

22:44.564 --> 22:49.399
But uh, when Karen passed,
Hank kinda fell apart,

22:49.402 --> 22:53.169
and he only had time
for Hannah and his kitchen,

22:53.172 --> 22:55.205
nothing else mattered.

22:55.208 --> 22:56.873
Okay, so you stepped in.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.375
Yeah.

22:58.378 --> 23:00.143
Hank asked me to take care of
the business side of things,

23:00.146 --> 23:03.913
but Hank doesn't really like
to work to a budget, so...

23:03.916 --> 23:06.649
It was difficult balancing
the books.

23:06.652 --> 23:09.119
Well, first thing we need
to do is get you set up

23:09.122 --> 23:12.055
with some restaurant
accounting software.

23:12.058 --> 23:16.192
Um, remember when I said I don't
really have a head for numbers?

23:22.602 --> 23:23.601
Hi.

23:26.072 --> 23:27.637
Uh, excuse me.

23:31.544 --> 23:33.511
Excuse me?

23:38.117 --> 23:39.449
Hello.

23:40.787 --> 23:42.752
So, as some of you might know,
I'm Maggie Young,

23:42.755 --> 23:46.055
and I'm going to be assisting
Hank in managing the restaurant

23:46.058 --> 23:47.690
while we develop
a frozen food line.

23:47.693 --> 23:49.626
You know what, we're kinda in
the middle of prep right now,

23:49.629 --> 23:51.127
so if you wouldn't mind...

23:51.130 --> 23:53.863
Yeah, I... I realize that,
I just wanted to,

23:53.866 --> 24:00.136
uh, introduce myself and, um,
see how you were doing.

24:00.139 --> 24:03.807
We're doing great.
Thanks for asking.

24:03.810 --> 24:04.474
Great.

24:04.477 --> 24:05.442
Yeah.

24:05.445 --> 24:06.844
Great.

24:10.850 --> 24:12.515
Okay, well, um...

24:12.518 --> 24:14.083
Let me know if I can help.

24:14.086 --> 24:16.553
Okay. We'll let you know.

24:16.556 --> 24:18.456
Nice to meet you.

24:36.809 --> 24:39.309
I can't believe she walked in
the kitchen like that.

24:39.312 --> 24:41.144
I mean, who does
she think she is?

24:41.147 --> 24:42.111
She's the boss.

24:42.114 --> 24:44.481
She is not the boss.
All right?

24:44.484 --> 24:46.983
She's just here helping out
with the money part, that's all.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.017
That's right.

24:48.020 --> 24:50.386
Hank is the boss, Emma.

24:50.389 --> 24:52.755
But this was never supposed
to be about money.

24:52.758 --> 24:54.757
This was supposed to be
about great food.

24:54.760 --> 24:57.293
Well, now it's about
frozen food.

24:57.296 --> 24:59.095
It's a nightmare,
that's what it is.

24:59.098 --> 25:03.199
So, what do we do now, boss?

25:03.202 --> 25:08.371
Honestly? I think you guys
should quit.

25:08.374 --> 25:09.539
I'm serious.

25:09.542 --> 25:11.307
You are both so good,
you could get jobs

25:11.310 --> 25:12.709
at any restaurant
in the country.

25:12.712 --> 25:14.544
You don't need to stay here
just 'cause I messed up.

25:14.547 --> 25:16.446
No way, Chef.

25:16.449 --> 25:21.284
For better or worse, fresh
or frozen, we don't care.

25:21.287 --> 25:22.585
Ehh.

25:22.588 --> 25:23.753
That's right.

25:23.756 --> 25:24.787
We are a team.

25:24.790 --> 25:25.789
<i>Mmhmm.</i>

25:28.528 --> 25:29.692
I don't deserve you guys.

25:29.695 --> 25:30.960
Yeah, that's true.

25:53.352 --> 25:56.653
I see you're, uh, making
yourself at home in my office?

25:56.656 --> 25:57.887
Oh, yes, thank you.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.822
I'm just getting everything
situated.

25:59.825 --> 26:01.691
Mmhmm.

26:01.694 --> 26:06.362
You know, if you wanna talk to
me about the frozen food line,

26:06.365 --> 26:08.831
or if you have any questions
about the restaurant in general,

26:08.834 --> 26:10.133
you can talk to me.

26:10.136 --> 26:11.301
In fact, you can talk to me
anytime you want.

26:11.304 --> 26:14.137
Just talk to me in here, okay?

26:14.140 --> 26:18.241
Not in the kitchen, and never
in front of my crew.

26:18.244 --> 26:22.612
Okay. Because I do have some
ideas that are worth sharing.

26:22.615 --> 26:24.080
See, that's the thing.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.248
There's no sharing.

26:25.251 --> 26:26.249
All right?

26:26.252 --> 26:27.550
This is not a think tank.

26:27.553 --> 26:28.985
It's not a democracy.

26:30.523 --> 26:34.858
That explains why your menu
hasn't changed in four years.

26:36.329 --> 26:37.795
Hey!

26:40.433 --> 26:42.533
No way.

26:46.105 --> 26:48.905
Okay. I see what you're doing.

26:48.908 --> 26:50.006
What I'm do-

26:50.009 --> 26:50.974
I'm making sure everything's
in order.

26:50.977 --> 26:52.241
No, no, no.

26:52.244 --> 26:53.610
You are being completely
transparent right now.

26:53.613 --> 26:55.411
Okay. I don't understand.

26:55.414 --> 26:59.182
No. It's so obvious that it...
it's actually kind of funny.

26:59.185 --> 27:00.750
I don't get it.

27:00.753 --> 27:03.853
You want me to quit so that you
can take over the restaurant.

27:03.856 --> 27:04.721
That's it.

27:04.724 --> 27:06.055
I know it.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.624
Hank.

27:07.627 --> 27:09.292
We don't want your restaurant.

27:09.295 --> 27:11.327
Oh really? You don't?

27:11.330 --> 27:13.029
No.

27:13.032 --> 27:16.666
What we want is to create the
best gourmet frozen food line

27:16.669 --> 27:18.167
in the world.

27:18.170 --> 27:20.003
But I know you're not going
to be able to focus on that,

27:20.006 --> 27:22.171
until your restaurant
is back on track.

27:22.174 --> 27:23.406
So let's make a deal.

27:23.409 --> 27:25.274
We already have a deal.

27:25.277 --> 27:27.410
This is a deal just
between you and me.

27:28.581 --> 27:29.946
I'm listening.

27:29.949 --> 27:32.348
You help me with
the frozen food line,

27:32.351 --> 27:35.285
and I'll help you
get your star back.

27:36.822 --> 27:38.355
Deal?

27:40.693 --> 27:42.026
Deal.

27:44.196 --> 27:47.030
All right, so where do we start?

27:47.033 --> 27:50.333
Well, you say that frozen food
isn't any good.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.001
It's not.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.469
So, teach me.

27:53.472 --> 27:56.105
Teach me about great food.

27:56.108 --> 27:56.739
Yeah?

27:56.742 --> 27:57.708
Great.

27:58.644 --> 27:59.976
Lesson number one.

27:59.979 --> 28:03.780
Great food starts with
great ingredients.

28:03.783 --> 28:05.214
Let's go.

28:05.217 --> 28:06.550
Come on.

28:11.524 --> 28:14.390
You said yourself, I have
an excellent palette.

28:14.393 --> 28:16.459
Yeah, but that's when I thought
you were a food critic.

28:16.462 --> 28:17.460
Oh. Okay.

28:18.531 --> 28:19.629
Oh, hi Hank.
How ya doin'?

28:19.632 --> 28:21.197
I'm good. What do you
got here today?

28:21.200 --> 28:24.267
Dungeness crab, fresh off
the boat this mornin'.

28:24.270 --> 28:25.435
They look fantastic.

28:25.438 --> 28:27.003
Okay, I'm gonna
take three cases.

28:27.006 --> 28:29.105
All right, I'll have 'em
delivered to the restaurant.

28:29.108 --> 28:30.006
All right, that'd be great.

28:30.009 --> 28:32.075
Wait, wait. You can't do that.

28:32.078 --> 28:33.142
Can't do what?

28:33.145 --> 28:34.811
You didn't ask him how
much they cost.

28:34.814 --> 28:37.113
She wants to know how much
they cost, Georgie.

28:37.116 --> 28:39.048
Oh yeah? Who's this?

28:39.051 --> 28:40.283
New girlfriend?

28:40.286 --> 28:41.517
I'm Maggie.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.186
No, no, this is Maggie,
she's a...

28:43.189 --> 28:44.053
Consultant.

28:44.056 --> 28:44.887
Consultant.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.055
She's a consultant.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.557
And I am teaching her
about great food,

28:47.560 --> 28:49.992
and she, I guess, is teaching
me how to stay on budget.

28:50.730 --> 28:51.828
Oh, wow.

28:51.831 --> 28:53.162
Better give her a good
price then, huh?

28:53.165 --> 28:53.963
That's right.

28:53.966 --> 28:54.997
All right, 12 bucks a pound.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.200
Best price in the city.

28:57.203 --> 28:57.967
You sure about that?

28:57.970 --> 28:59.669
Oh yeah.

28:59.672 --> 29:03.239
But for you, I'll let you
have 'em for $11.50.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.073
Okay, great.

29:04.076 --> 29:06.242
Thank you very much.

29:06.245 --> 29:08.311
You bring your consultant
back anytime, Hank.

29:08.314 --> 29:10.713
Yeah, will do, Georgie.
Thank you.

29:12.218 --> 29:14.350
Does he really have the best
prices in the city?

29:14.353 --> 29:15.184
No.

29:15.187 --> 29:16.419
I knew it!

29:16.422 --> 29:17.520
But he does have the best
seafood in the city,

29:17.523 --> 29:18.888
and that makes all
the difference

29:18.891 --> 29:20.056
when it comes to great food.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.460
Hey. Look at these.

29:24.997 --> 29:28.631
Nobody takes the time to think
about the food they eat anymore.

29:28.634 --> 29:32.735
It's because people are busy,
they have jobs and kids,

29:32.738 --> 29:34.403
they don't have time to cook
a meal from scratch.

29:34.406 --> 29:35.805
That's why the frozen
food industry

29:35.808 --> 29:39.041
is worth $230 billion a year.

29:39.044 --> 29:40.276
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.245
We live in a hectic world,
but...

29:42.248 --> 29:46.048
When you prepare a meal for
your family, or for a customer,

29:46.051 --> 29:49.051
what are you really giving them?

29:49.054 --> 29:50.586
Good quality sustenance?

29:50.589 --> 29:53.389
No! No, not sustenance.

29:53.392 --> 29:54.690
Love.

29:54.693 --> 29:55.858
You're giving them love.

29:55.861 --> 29:58.161
Love is the number one
ingredient in any dish.

29:58.164 --> 30:00.329
Without that,
you've got nothin'.

30:00.332 --> 30:01.631
It's very romantic.

30:01.634 --> 30:02.598
It's true.

30:02.601 --> 30:04.133
But love doesn't pay the bills.

30:05.504 --> 30:06.669
You know what, we need to get
you in the kitchen,

30:06.672 --> 30:08.838
because you need some
hands-on experience.

30:08.841 --> 30:09.672
Oh, hands on ex...

30:09.675 --> 30:12.141
Woah! Hey, hey.
You okay?

30:12.144 --> 30:13.109
Sorry.

30:13.112 --> 30:14.110
It's all right.

30:14.113 --> 30:15.945
Yes, just... embarrassed.

30:18.751 --> 30:19.749
I broke my heel.

30:19.752 --> 30:20.950
I can see that.

30:20.953 --> 30:23.186
You're lucky you didn't break
your ankle.

30:23.189 --> 30:24.320
Here, give me the other shoe.

30:24.323 --> 30:25.823
Yeah, come on.

30:28.227 --> 30:30.194
Here we go, thank you.

30:31.530 --> 30:32.461
Hey, uh...

30:33.799 --> 30:35.531
There you go.

30:35.534 --> 30:36.532
Those were expensive.

30:36.535 --> 30:38.701
Mmhmm, and now
they're practical.

30:38.704 --> 30:40.803
Time for lesson number two.
Come on, let's go.

30:40.806 --> 30:41.805
Chop-chop.

30:50.950 --> 30:53.016
Fantastic.

30:54.753 --> 30:57.221
Thank you very much,
have a good one.

31:10.703 --> 31:12.135
Hey.

31:18.277 --> 31:19.876
Hey, Leo, how we doing here?

31:19.879 --> 31:21.043
Doing good, Chef.

31:21.046 --> 31:22.979
Excellent, good.

31:22.982 --> 31:24.680
Got the invoice from
the wine merchant.

31:24.683 --> 31:26.082
Oh, great. Can you put it
in the office?

31:26.085 --> 31:26.916
Yeah, of course.

31:26.919 --> 31:28.117
Thank you.

31:28.120 --> 31:29.552
Getting the vendors
to deliver early, huh?

31:29.555 --> 31:30.753
It's what I do.

31:30.756 --> 31:33.222
Hmm, that's great.
I appreciate that.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.258
Same menu again tonight, huh?

31:35.261 --> 31:37.527
Nothing wrong with the classics.

31:39.865 --> 31:41.430
How are the potatoes
coming along?

31:41.433 --> 31:43.866
Great, about ten down.

31:43.869 --> 31:45.134
Ten?

31:45.137 --> 31:47.336
Oh, you gotta pick up the pace.

31:47.339 --> 31:48.471
Oh. Let me show you.

31:48.474 --> 31:49.473
Okay.

31:51.076 --> 31:54.443
Oh. Yeah, that's amazing.

31:54.446 --> 31:57.079
Nothing to it but to do it.

31:57.082 --> 31:58.047
Okay.

31:58.050 --> 31:59.449
You got this.

32:01.854 --> 32:04.520
So, how's the cooking
lesson going?

32:04.523 --> 32:05.688
Great.

32:05.691 --> 32:07.423
Not really sure what
I'm meant to learn

32:07.426 --> 32:08.524
from peeling potatoes.

32:08.527 --> 32:09.692
Well, you gotta start
somewhere, right?

32:10.729 --> 32:12.862
I also need to get back
to the office.

32:12.865 --> 32:14.764
Yeah, of course, I
completely understand.

32:14.767 --> 32:16.165
As soon as you finish.

32:16.168 --> 32:18.668
You know what?

32:18.671 --> 32:20.603
School's out for the day.

32:20.606 --> 32:22.571
Woah, woah, woah, hey.

32:22.574 --> 32:24.674
Woah, woah, woah, woah,
woah, what are you doing?

32:24.677 --> 32:28.077
You can't just walk out
of the kitchen like that.

32:28.080 --> 32:30.881
Watch me.

32:33.919 --> 32:35.885
What are you guys smiling at?

32:35.888 --> 32:37.987
She's spicy, Chef.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.589
I like that.

32:51.070 --> 32:53.069
It's a little thick.
More cream.

32:53.072 --> 32:54.603
Yes, Chef.

32:54.606 --> 32:56.038
Em, can you go to the back, to
see if the truffles came in?

32:56.041 --> 32:56.772
Yes, Chef.

32:56.775 --> 32:58.875
Thank you.

33:00.579 --> 33:01.577
Here we go.

33:04.016 --> 33:04.847
Good on truffles, Chef.

33:04.850 --> 33:05.815
Thank you, how many we got?

33:05.818 --> 33:06.682
Five.

33:06.685 --> 33:08.851
Okay. How's the stock coming?

33:08.854 --> 33:09.618
Almost there.

33:09.621 --> 33:11.355
Excellent.

33:12.057 --> 33:12.989
Thank you, Bernie.

33:12.992 --> 33:14.490
Anytime.

33:14.493 --> 33:15.424
I'm just gonna go out and
get some candles for tonight.

33:15.427 --> 33:16.192
Do you need anything?

33:16.195 --> 33:17.226
No, I'm good.

33:17.229 --> 33:19.096
All right then,
I'll see you lat.

33:21.100 --> 33:22.865
We've got three cases
of the Chianti,

33:22.868 --> 33:24.633
but we are running low
on the Brunello.

33:24.636 --> 33:26.035
Well, that's odd.

33:26.038 --> 33:28.070
The stock report shows we
still have a case and a half.

33:28.073 --> 33:31.507
Yeah, there was an accident
in the cellar.

33:33.012 --> 33:35.544
Okay.

33:36.749 --> 33:38.848
Osteria, this is Maggie,
how can I help you?

33:38.851 --> 33:39.982
Oh, uh, hi.

33:39.985 --> 33:41.317
You must be my dad's new boss.

33:42.287 --> 33:43.285
Co-worker.

33:43.288 --> 33:44.687
Is this Hannah?

33:44.690 --> 33:46.122
Yeah. Do you think
you could tell my dad

33:46.125 --> 33:47.089
that my bus broke down?

33:47.092 --> 33:48.758
Oh. Um, yeah.

33:48.761 --> 33:49.792
He's in the kitchen.

33:49.795 --> 33:50.993
Can I have him call you
right back?

33:50.996 --> 33:53.330
Okay, all good.

33:59.938 --> 34:01.037
Hank.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.772
Uh, not a good time right now.

34:02.775 --> 34:03.739
Hannah just called.

34:03.742 --> 34:05.908
Her school bus broke down.

34:05.911 --> 34:07.510
Oh, uh...

34:07.513 --> 34:10.146
Oh, oh jeez, okay.

34:10.149 --> 34:12.214
Um...

34:13.685 --> 34:14.884
<i>Hey sweetheart, it's me,
what's up?</i>

34:14.887 --> 34:15.717
Hey, Dad.

34:15.721 --> 34:16.819
Uh, my bus broke down.

34:16.822 --> 34:18.521
Do you think you can come
pick me up?

34:18.524 --> 34:20.656
<i>It's gonna be like two hours
till the next one comes.</i>

34:20.659 --> 34:21.791
Oh...

34:21.793 --> 34:23.092
Gee, uh, I'm kind
of jammed up right now.

34:23.094 --> 34:24.493
Can I send Uncle Bernie?

34:24.496 --> 34:27.228
Yeah, that's totally fine.
I'll send you the address.

34:27.232 --> 34:29.232
<i>Okay. I love you.</i>

34:31.570 --> 34:33.268
I realize you're on a bus full
of kids right now,

34:33.272 --> 34:35.036
so you can't say
"I love you" back

34:35.040 --> 34:39.708
without sounding totally uncool,
so just say "bye, Dad."

34:39.710 --> 34:41.177
Bye, Dad.

34:41.179 --> 34:42.878
'Kay, bye sweetheart.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.612
Hmm.

34:44.616 --> 34:47.516
That was really sweet.

34:47.518 --> 34:49.585
Even I do have my moments.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.286
Just not in the kitchen.

34:51.290 --> 34:52.922
I'm in the kitchen right now.

34:52.925 --> 34:54.422
You know what I mean.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.425
Look, I'm the Chef, I
have to be in charge,

34:56.428 --> 34:59.261
it's a lot of stress for
any one person to handle.

34:59.264 --> 35:00.496
So, share the load.

35:00.499 --> 35:02.698
You don't have to do it
all by yourself anymore.

35:02.701 --> 35:06.402
You have an amazing team here.

35:06.405 --> 35:09.271
Let us help you.

35:09.274 --> 35:11.274
Okay. I will.

35:15.314 --> 35:17.346
Hey Mel, have you, uh,
you seen Bernie?

35:17.349 --> 35:18.781
He's not answering his cell.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.716
He said he had to go
and get candles.

35:20.719 --> 35:21.851
Oh, candles, okay.

35:21.854 --> 35:22.651
I gotta figure this out.

35:22.654 --> 35:23.819
Um...

35:23.822 --> 35:24.954
Why don't I go pick her up?

35:24.957 --> 35:27.189
Oh, no, no. You don't
have to do that.

35:27.192 --> 35:28.557
No, it'll be fine.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.960
Only if you think you can
manage without me, though.

35:30.963 --> 35:33.262
Okay. Yeah, that'd be great.

35:33.265 --> 35:34.230
I appreciate that.

35:34.233 --> 35:35.397
Same team, right?

35:35.400 --> 35:38.067
Right. Same team.

35:38.070 --> 35:39.401
Why don't you text me
the address

35:39.404 --> 35:40.903
of where she's gonna be
and I'll go get my things?

35:40.906 --> 35:42.605
Okay, great, I'll call
the school

35:42.608 --> 35:43.572
and let 'em know you're coming.

35:43.575 --> 35:45.007
<i>Great.</i>

35:45.010 --> 35:46.977
Great. Thanks, Mel.

35:52.284 --> 35:53.482
<i>Thanks for rescuing me.</i>

35:53.485 --> 35:55.050
<i>No problem.</i>

35:55.053 --> 35:56.652
Do you have lots of homework
tonight?

35:56.655 --> 35:57.620
Oh, uh, no.

35:57.623 --> 35:59.355
I finished it all on the bus.

35:59.358 --> 36:00.156
Good for you.

36:00.159 --> 36:01.023
Yeah.

36:01.026 --> 36:02.224
What about you?

36:02.227 --> 36:03.459
Are you going to be working
late tonight?

36:03.462 --> 36:04.960
No, I don't think so.

36:04.963 --> 36:06.795
Your father's pretty much
got everything under control.

36:06.798 --> 36:08.397
He doesn't really need me.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.232
That's what he said.

36:10.235 --> 36:11.267
He said that?

36:12.137 --> 36:12.968
No, I'm kidding.

36:12.971 --> 36:13.702
Of course not.

36:13.705 --> 36:15.705
Of course he needs you.

36:18.243 --> 36:20.676
Do you wanna come in
and hang out?

36:20.679 --> 36:23.212
It'd be nice to hang out with
my dad's new boss lady.

36:24.149 --> 36:25.214
Consultant.

36:25.217 --> 36:27.483
I prefer "boss lady."

36:27.486 --> 36:29.151
You know, I do too.

36:29.154 --> 36:29.985
Yeah.

36:31.023 --> 36:32.288
Boss lady.

36:32.291 --> 36:34.757
Yeah. Sure, um, yeah,
I'll come in, thanks.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.459
Awesome.

36:38.564 --> 36:41.197
One mushroom pepperoni
pizza coming right up.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.731
I'm so excited.

36:42.734 --> 36:46.068
You've seriously never ordered
pizza at your house before?

36:46.071 --> 36:47.102
Well, no.

36:47.105 --> 36:48.537
Dad insists on making it
from scratch.

36:49.408 --> 36:51.274
Of course.

36:56.415 --> 36:57.947
It's good. It is good.

36:57.950 --> 37:01.116
It's not as good as Dad's,
but it's close.

37:01.119 --> 37:03.119
It's pretty good, right?

37:03.956 --> 37:06.655
Your hair's really pretty.

37:06.658 --> 37:07.590
Oh, thank you.

37:07.593 --> 37:08.824
Yours is too.

37:08.827 --> 37:10.993
No, it's not.

37:10.996 --> 37:12.328
It's long and straight
and boring,

37:12.331 --> 37:14.597
and I can't really do
anything with it.

37:14.600 --> 37:15.698
I think your hair is beautiful.

37:15.701 --> 37:17.600
I had long hair when
I was your age.

37:17.603 --> 37:18.734
You did?

37:18.737 --> 37:20.703
Yeah, and my mom always
used to style it

37:20.706 --> 37:23.106
in an inside-out French braid...

37:26.078 --> 37:27.876
Oh.

37:27.879 --> 37:30.246
Sorry, Hannah. I wasn't
thinking.

37:30.249 --> 37:33.115
So, you heard about my mom, huh?

37:33.118 --> 37:35.217
Yeah, I did.

37:35.220 --> 37:37.319
And I'm really sorry
that happened.

37:37.322 --> 37:38.854
Thanks.

37:38.857 --> 37:40.856
My dad's great and everything,
but uh...

37:40.859 --> 37:42.658
I really miss her.

37:42.661 --> 37:43.759
I bet you do.

37:43.762 --> 37:46.395
She had great hair,

37:46.398 --> 37:50.866
and she was so beautiful
and had amazing style.

37:50.869 --> 37:53.702
Kinda like you.

37:53.705 --> 37:55.838
Oh, thank you.

37:55.841 --> 37:58.774
You could teach my dad
a thing or two.

37:58.777 --> 37:59.842
About style?

37:59.845 --> 38:00.676
Yeah.

38:02.581 --> 38:03.912
Well, your dad, uh, he's a chef,

38:03.915 --> 38:05.114
he's gotta wear a uniform.

38:05.117 --> 38:06.515
Thank goodness.

38:06.518 --> 38:08.317
You should see him when
he's around the house,

38:08.320 --> 38:09.718
he can't even match his socks.

38:12.190 --> 38:14.089
Hey, I have an idea.

38:14.092 --> 38:16.959
Do you want me to teach
you how to do that braid?

38:16.962 --> 38:19.094
It's really easy.

38:19.097 --> 38:21.463
That'd be great.

38:21.466 --> 38:23.265
Okay, good. We'll do that.

38:23.268 --> 38:25.701
How about right now?

38:25.704 --> 38:29.906
Uh... Absolutely.

38:31.043 --> 38:32.975
Okay.

38:32.978 --> 38:38.013
So. It's really simple, it's
almost like a regular braid,

38:38.016 --> 38:43.653
except you're going to go
under instead of going over.

38:52.631 --> 38:53.796
Hey.

38:53.799 --> 38:55.464
Hey.

38:55.467 --> 38:56.432
Thank you.

38:56.435 --> 38:58.067
Uh, how's she doing?

38:58.070 --> 38:59.268
She's fast asleep.

38:59.271 --> 39:01.437
Oh, good.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.739
Well, I definitely
appreciate that.

39:03.742 --> 39:05.274
You're welcome, anytime.

39:05.277 --> 39:06.342
Listen, you hungry?

39:06.345 --> 39:07.242
You, you want me to cook
ya something?

39:07.245 --> 39:09.978
No, no. I'm stuffed.

39:09.981 --> 39:11.080
What, you cooked?

39:11.083 --> 39:12.948
No. Absolutely not.

39:12.951 --> 39:14.149
We ordered in.

39:14.152 --> 39:16.318
You ordered in.

39:16.321 --> 39:17.353
Pizza?

39:17.356 --> 39:18.520
Yes.

39:18.523 --> 39:19.621
That's not just any pizza.

39:19.624 --> 39:21.023
That's Captain's Pizza.

39:21.026 --> 39:22.191
It's delicious.

39:22.194 --> 39:23.325
Oh.

39:23.328 --> 39:24.927
You should try a slice.

39:24.930 --> 39:26.962
I mean, it's cold, but you could
put it in the oven, heat it up.

39:26.965 --> 39:28.797
Hmm. Well,
maybe I'll do that.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.366
Look, do you want to...

39:30.369 --> 39:32.735
do you want to stay and have
a glass of wine with me, or?

39:32.738 --> 39:34.370
Sure.

39:34.373 --> 39:36.372
Yeah. That would be lovely.
Thank you.

39:36.375 --> 39:37.072
Yeah?

39:37.075 --> 39:38.273
Mmhmm.

39:38.276 --> 39:41.210
Okay. I, uh, think I have
some right here.

39:41.213 --> 39:43.213
Yeah, this one's good.

39:45.617 --> 39:48.317
You know, it's been
a very long time

39:48.320 --> 39:51.320
since I've had pizza like this.

39:51.323 --> 39:54.456
It's pretty good, huh?

39:54.459 --> 39:55.290
Yeah.

39:55.293 --> 39:56.458
It's actually not that bad.

39:57.963 --> 40:00.462
It's frozen.

40:00.465 --> 40:01.730
It is not.

40:01.733 --> 40:02.765
Yes, it is.

40:02.768 --> 40:04.600
All of the crusts from
Captain's Pizza

40:04.603 --> 40:06.735
are made at the frozen
food factory,

40:06.738 --> 40:08.170
and then they're shipped
to the restaurants

40:08.173 --> 40:11.373
where they're cooked
and delivered to you.

40:11.376 --> 40:13.242
I did not know that.

40:14.546 --> 40:16.879
See, all frozen food
isn't terrible after all.

40:16.882 --> 40:18.514
I see what you did.

40:18.517 --> 40:21.216
You ordered that on purpose.
Well played.

40:21.219 --> 40:22.184
Thank you.

40:22.187 --> 40:24.219
Mmm.

40:24.222 --> 40:25.687
Although it's not
as good as mine.

40:25.690 --> 40:27.122
No, of course not.

40:28.360 --> 40:30.826
So, you probably get asked
this all the time,

40:30.829 --> 40:32.561
but how did you get
interested in cooking?

40:32.564 --> 40:35.564
Oh. Well, that's simple.

40:35.567 --> 40:36.632
My mom.

40:36.635 --> 40:37.866
Aww.

40:37.869 --> 40:39.868
She's Italian, and
she's a great cook.

40:39.871 --> 40:41.537
Better than any chef
I've ever worked for.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.772
She's the one that taught
me how to cook with love.

40:43.775 --> 40:44.840
Aww.

40:44.843 --> 40:46.108
Yeah.

40:46.111 --> 40:47.342
And she's also the one
that talked me into going

40:47.345 --> 40:49.411
to culinary school.

40:49.414 --> 40:51.580
Which is where you met
your wife, right?

40:51.583 --> 40:53.849
Yeah. Karen.

40:53.852 --> 40:58.454
Uh, she was a good cook, too.
But she was a great baker.

40:58.457 --> 41:00.923
I'm really sorry.

41:00.926 --> 41:03.959
Yeah, me too.

41:03.962 --> 41:08.263
On weekends, she and Hannah,
they'd just bake all day long.

41:08.266 --> 41:12.034
I loved watching 'em.

41:12.037 --> 41:16.538
Well, if you don't mind
me saying so,

41:16.541 --> 41:21.376
I think Hannah is a really
great, well-adjusted kid.

41:21.379 --> 41:23.312
Thank you for saying that.

41:23.315 --> 41:26.648
I think she's a great kid, too.

41:26.651 --> 41:28.784
Anyway, you know what?
That's enough about me.

41:28.787 --> 41:30.519
How about you,
anybody in your life?

41:30.522 --> 41:33.622
Uhh... My laptop?

41:33.625 --> 41:36.024
Come on, really?
Never married?

41:37.128 --> 41:38.227
Once.

41:38.230 --> 41:39.294
Aha.

41:39.297 --> 41:41.430
It was right out of college,

41:41.433 --> 41:46.034
and then he got a job transfer
to Chicago,

41:46.037 --> 41:51.940
and he took it, and now
he's married to his assistant.

41:51.943 --> 41:52.941
Cliché.

41:54.045 --> 41:55.577
It really is, isn't it?

41:55.580 --> 41:57.012
Ugh.

41:58.884 --> 42:02.117
So, um, yeah, that sort
of soured me on things,

42:02.120 --> 42:05.988
so um, my longest
relationship is,

42:05.991 --> 42:08.524
uh, with my laptop.

42:08.527 --> 42:11.760
Well, here is to the lucky
guy that steals you

42:11.763 --> 42:12.995
from that laptop.

42:12.998 --> 42:14.496
Oh, let's drink to that
for sure.

42:21.206 --> 42:22.571
Hmm.

42:22.574 --> 42:24.740
Oh.

42:26.611 --> 42:29.378
Andrea would like
a progress report, tonight.

42:29.381 --> 42:32.714
So, I should probably go.

42:32.717 --> 42:34.449
Right, I understand.

42:34.452 --> 42:37.553
Um, well thank you, again,
very much for tonight,

42:37.556 --> 42:38.687
I really appreciate it.

42:38.690 --> 42:40.822
See you tomorrow.

42:40.825 --> 42:43.692
Yeah, yeah.

42:43.695 --> 42:46.496
I'm really looking
forward to it.

42:55.040 --> 42:57.072
"Really
looking forward to it?"

42:58.009 --> 42:59.708
"Really looking forward
to it."

42:59.711 --> 43:00.576
Who says that?

43:00.579 --> 43:01.476
Nobody.

43:01.479 --> 43:02.477
Nobody says that.

43:02.480 --> 43:04.379
That's who.

43:04.983 --> 43:06.315
Don't look back.

43:06.318 --> 43:07.049
Don't look back.

43:07.052 --> 43:09.218
Don't look back.

43:24.235 --> 43:25.767
Lights on.

43:29.074 --> 43:30.073
Oh.

43:32.277 --> 43:34.076
Uh, good morning, Andrea.

43:34.079 --> 43:37.312
Hmm, did I catch you snoozing?

43:37.315 --> 43:38.981
No?

43:38.984 --> 43:41.450
Early bird catches
the worm, Maggie.

43:41.453 --> 43:45.921
So, how are things going
with my new favourite chef?

43:45.924 --> 43:47.122
Uh, they're, they're good, yeah.

43:47.125 --> 43:48.423
They're grea-they're great.

43:48.426 --> 43:49.691
<i>Excellent.</i>

43:49.694 --> 43:52.828
Now, I need you to get Hank
into the food lab.

43:52.831 --> 43:55.664
Um, yeah, he's, he's working
on some ideas,

43:55.667 --> 43:58.400
but uh, I might need a little
bit more time in the restaurant,

43:58.403 --> 44:01.236
just to... get everything
back on track.

44:01.239 --> 44:04.840
I want to get the gourmet frozen
food line into production, ASAP.

44:04.843 --> 44:06.241
I, I just think that if...

44:06.244 --> 44:08.677
Stop. As much as I love hearing
what you think, Maggie,

44:08.680 --> 44:11.580
what I need for you to do
is to get Hank Daniels

44:11.583 --> 44:14.116
into the food lab.

44:14.119 --> 44:16.551
I understand, but
the restaurant is...

44:16.554 --> 44:18.453
...is not important.

44:18.456 --> 44:20.422
Okay. Yeah. Got it.

44:20.425 --> 44:22.425
<i>Good. Get to it.</i>

44:29.934 --> 44:30.933
Lights off!

44:44.416 --> 44:46.948
<i>Hannah?</i>

44:46.951 --> 44:49.552
Hannah? Breakfast.

44:50.221 --> 44:51.286
Morning, Dad.

44:51.289 --> 44:52.254
Good morning.

44:52.257 --> 44:54.122
Smells amazing.

44:54.125 --> 44:55.624
Yeah.

44:55.627 --> 44:57.426
What did you make?

44:57.429 --> 44:58.760
Well, seeing as how I never know

44:58.763 --> 45:00.629
what your dietary restrictions
are going to be...

45:00.632 --> 45:01.997
I am not that fussy.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.298
Yes, you are.

45:03.301 --> 45:05.067
So, I made everything.

45:05.070 --> 45:05.901
Everything?

45:05.904 --> 45:07.069
Mmhmm.

45:07.072 --> 45:08.937
We have eggs Florentine,
oatmeal, pancakes,

45:08.940 --> 45:11.673
omelette, fruit salad,
even toast.

45:11.676 --> 45:14.142
And we have each other.

45:14.145 --> 45:16.078
We always have each other.

45:16.081 --> 45:17.479
I love you, kiddo.

45:17.482 --> 45:19.514
I love you, too.

45:19.517 --> 45:21.983
Now stop being so cute, cause
you're gonna make me cry.

45:21.986 --> 45:23.118
What's it gonna be?

45:23.121 --> 45:25.087
Hmm, pancakes.

45:25.090 --> 45:25.787
Pancakes.

45:25.790 --> 45:26.855
Yep.

45:26.858 --> 45:27.789
I knew you were gonna
say pancakes.

45:28.660 --> 45:29.925
All right.

45:29.928 --> 45:31.660
What are we gonna do
with the leftovers?

45:31.663 --> 45:33.428
Ah, we'll just take it
to the restaurant.

45:33.431 --> 45:34.429
Crew's always hungry?

45:34.432 --> 45:36.164
Right.

45:36.167 --> 45:37.099
Hey Dad?

45:37.102 --> 45:38.033
Mmhmm?

45:38.036 --> 45:40.036
Do you think Maggie's pretty?

45:43.408 --> 45:45.407
Sorry, what?

45:45.410 --> 45:47.642
You know, Maggie?
Your new boss lady.

45:47.645 --> 45:49.978
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know
who Maggie is.

45:49.981 --> 45:54.282
So... Do you think she's pretty?

45:54.285 --> 45:55.183
I don't know.

45:55.186 --> 45:57.385
I'm gonna... Yeah, well yes.

45:57.388 --> 45:59.254
Why are you asking me this?

45:59.257 --> 46:00.188
No reason.

46:00.191 --> 46:02.257
Yeah, you always have a reason.

46:02.260 --> 46:04.593
Just, be nicer to her, okay?

46:04.596 --> 46:06.661
Why?

46:06.664 --> 46:07.896
I looked her up.

46:07.899 --> 46:08.964
Awe.

46:08.967 --> 46:10.732
She's for real, okay?

46:10.735 --> 46:12.400
Very accomplished.

46:12.403 --> 46:14.903
Vice president of product
development.

46:14.906 --> 46:16.204
Product development.

46:16.207 --> 46:18.206
Whatever that is.

46:18.209 --> 46:20.442
I just, I think she can
really help you,

46:20.445 --> 46:21.877
if you let her.

46:21.880 --> 46:23.011
Yeah.

46:23.014 --> 46:24.513
Tell her she has nice shoes.

46:24.516 --> 46:25.814
Girls like that.

46:25.817 --> 46:27.048
Nice shoes?

46:27.051 --> 46:28.884
Uh-huh.

46:28.887 --> 46:29.886
Okay.

46:31.823 --> 46:32.954
<i>Hey.</i>

46:32.957 --> 46:35.023
Uh... Nice shoes.

46:35.026 --> 46:36.024
What?

46:36.027 --> 46:37.993
Your shoes.
They're nice.

46:37.996 --> 46:42.564
Oh. Uh, thank you.

46:42.567 --> 46:44.466
So are yours.

46:44.469 --> 46:47.769
You... you know, for, for...
um, kitchen shoes.

46:47.772 --> 46:50.772
Well, they... they are
my fanciest pair after all.

46:50.775 --> 46:55.344
I generally save them
for formal occasions.

47:01.119 --> 47:02.150
Hey, Stan.

47:02.153 --> 47:03.451
Can I talk to you for a minute?

47:03.454 --> 47:05.854
What's up?

47:08.526 --> 47:10.459
About the wine inventory...

47:13.097 --> 47:14.796
Hey, Stan.

47:14.799 --> 47:15.897
Everything all right?

47:15.900 --> 47:18.066
No, everything is not
all right, Hank.

47:18.069 --> 47:19.301
She fired me.

47:19.304 --> 47:20.302
Who fired you?

47:20.305 --> 47:21.436
Your new boss.

47:21.439 --> 47:22.904
The frozen food queen.

47:22.907 --> 47:24.739
Maggie? Maggie can't fire you.

47:24.742 --> 47:25.674
Hold... hold on, just a second.

47:25.677 --> 47:27.108
No, I'm outta here.

47:27.111 --> 47:30.079
Good luck keeping this place
open with her in charge.

47:32.884 --> 47:33.682
What?

47:33.685 --> 47:35.784
Hold on, just a second here.

47:35.787 --> 47:36.785
Hey.

47:36.788 --> 47:38.687
Stan just told me you fired him.

47:38.690 --> 47:40.121
That's right.

47:40.124 --> 47:41.089
Well, don't you think
that's something

47:41.092 --> 47:42.424
that we should talk about?

47:42.427 --> 47:43.959
Well, that was the plan,

47:43.962 --> 47:47.963
but when I showed him the wine
inventory, he blew up at me.

47:47.966 --> 47:49.564
That doesn't mean you get
to fire him.

47:49.567 --> 47:51.633
He was stealing, Hank.

47:51.636 --> 47:53.702
Stealing?

47:53.705 --> 47:56.905
A case here, a case there,
but it adds up.

47:56.908 --> 47:59.774
Over $3,000 this month alone.

47:59.777 --> 48:02.310
Hank, I'm sorry.
I had no idea.

48:02.313 --> 48:05.013
Three thousand dollars, really?

48:05.016 --> 48:06.147
Wow, that's, uh...

48:06.150 --> 48:08.950
Horrible. Yeah, I know.

48:08.953 --> 48:10.018
Right.

48:10.021 --> 48:12.020
Well, who's gonna
run the bar, then?

48:12.023 --> 48:14.322
I am, and Maggie's gonna
manage the restaurant

48:14.325 --> 48:15.857
till we find someone new.

48:15.860 --> 48:17.993
Bern, you're the restaurant
manager.

48:17.996 --> 48:19.728
But I am a terrible
manager, Hank.

48:19.731 --> 48:21.496
We both know this.

48:21.499 --> 48:24.466
I mean, I never even thought
to look at the wine inventory.

48:24.469 --> 48:26.134
And you're okay going back
behind the bar?

48:26.137 --> 48:28.370
Oh yeah, no, no, no,
I'm more than okay.

48:28.373 --> 48:29.838
I am over the moon.

48:31.175 --> 48:32.707
You want me to show you
the wine inventory?

48:32.710 --> 48:33.909
No, no, it's fine.

48:33.912 --> 48:36.478
I uh, I believe you.

48:36.481 --> 48:39.814
So, this is probably bad timing,
but I wanted to talk to you

48:39.817 --> 48:42.617
about going down to
the frozen food lab.

48:42.620 --> 48:43.618
Right, yes.

48:43.621 --> 48:45.620
Uh... I am working
on some recipes.

48:45.623 --> 48:49.324
It's just that Andrea wants
to move up the timeline.

48:49.327 --> 48:50.425
Really. How come?

48:50.428 --> 48:51.760
She's excited to get started.

48:51.763 --> 48:54.262
And, if you get started
working on the recipes,

48:54.265 --> 48:56.164
we will have money to renovate
the restaurant.

48:56.167 --> 48:57.699
What do you want to renovate
the restaurant for?

48:57.702 --> 48:59.801
People love it the way it is.

48:59.804 --> 49:02.604
Did you read the gourmet food
guide review?

49:02.607 --> 49:04.906
No, no, I never read
the reviews.

49:04.909 --> 49:07.709
Well, let's just take a look,
shall we?

49:07.712 --> 49:09.077
Fine.

49:09.080 --> 49:10.545
"The formerly great
Italian restaurant

49:10.548 --> 49:15.383
"has lost its way,
failing to adapt and evolve.

49:15.386 --> 49:21.022
"The food, like the décor,
has become stale."

49:21.025 --> 49:23.459
Okay. Okay.

49:25.596 --> 49:26.595
Thank you.

49:28.499 --> 49:30.298
You've heard of fish sticks?

49:30.301 --> 49:31.967
Sure, yeah, it was
my daughter's favourite

49:31.970 --> 49:33.868
till she was about five.

49:33.871 --> 49:35.236
Well, during the early 1900s,

49:35.239 --> 49:38.006
the founder of Flash Frozen
Foods International,

49:38.009 --> 49:42.877
Doctor Kent Fink, worked for the
US government as a naturalist.

49:42.880 --> 49:44.346
Oh.

49:44.349 --> 49:45.914
Stationed in the Arctic,

49:45.917 --> 49:47.649
Doctor Fink was able to observe

49:47.652 --> 49:51.953
how the Native American people
preserved their food for the winter.

49:51.956 --> 49:53.755
He returned from the Arctic,

49:53.758 --> 49:57.192
adapted the technology for
commercial use, perfected it,

49:57.195 --> 50:01.563
and in 1922, began Fink Frozen
Foods International.

50:01.566 --> 50:03.098
Hmm.

50:03.101 --> 50:05.467
But the name never really stuck,
so his successor changed it

50:05.470 --> 50:07.535
to Flash Frozen Foods
International.

50:07.538 --> 50:09.771
Fascinating.

50:09.774 --> 50:13.541
Our biggest seller, of course,
is our classic turkey dinner.

50:13.544 --> 50:17.145
Over two billion units sold
in the United States alone.

50:17.148 --> 50:19.381
But recently, we've been
experimenting with a wide array

50:19.384 --> 50:22.150
of food profiles, like paella.

50:22.153 --> 50:24.119
Oh, I love paella.

50:24.122 --> 50:25.020
Uh, please, have a bite.

50:25.023 --> 50:26.989
Yeah? Okay.

50:34.298 --> 50:38.566
Um... That's not paella.

50:38.569 --> 50:41.036
Yes, we've been struggling
with the rice dishes.

50:41.039 --> 50:42.604
Rice doesn't freeze well.

50:42.607 --> 50:44.573
The frozen pizza, however,
is great.

50:49.514 --> 50:50.678
What did you think?

50:50.681 --> 50:52.313
I didn't hate it, hate it.

50:53.684 --> 50:54.949
Okay, well, it's a good start.

50:54.952 --> 50:56.684
Well, there's definitely room
for improvement.

50:56.687 --> 50:57.819
That's why we need your help.

50:57.822 --> 50:58.653
Hmm.

50:58.656 --> 51:00.121
I gotta be honest with you,

51:00.124 --> 51:01.589
I don't think frozen food is
ever going to taste the way

51:01.592 --> 51:05.326
I would want it to taste,
but, a deal's a deal, right?

51:05.329 --> 51:07.228
That's right, it is.

51:07.231 --> 51:08.930
Yeah, I was afraid you were
going to say that.

51:21.212 --> 51:22.043
Hey, uh, Chef?

51:22.046 --> 51:23.044
Uh-huh?

51:23.047 --> 51:25.480
We are out of Linguini.

51:25.483 --> 51:26.648
What?

51:26.651 --> 51:27.816
You serious?

51:27.819 --> 51:29.150
How are we out of Linguini?

51:29.153 --> 51:31.653
I... I... I'm sorry, I...
I really messed up.

51:31.656 --> 51:33.488
How... how about we do
the... the dish with,

51:33.491 --> 51:34.823
uh, risotto instead?

51:34.826 --> 51:36.491
No, we're not gonna do
another dish with risotto.

51:36.494 --> 51:39.060
Do you want me to tell the
wait staff to 86 the Linguini?

51:39.063 --> 51:40.929
Guys, come on, we're
an Italian restaurant.

51:40.932 --> 51:42.330
We're not going to run out
of Linguini.

51:42.333 --> 51:46.367
Okay, so what are you gonna do?

51:46.370 --> 51:47.902
Lesson number three.

51:47.905 --> 51:49.304
We're gonna make pasta.

51:49.307 --> 51:51.372
<i>♪ I wake up and
I pinch myself ♪</i>

51:51.375 --> 51:52.774
We?

51:52.777 --> 51:55.176
<i>♪ You're with me
not someone else ♪</i>

51:55.179 --> 51:57.679
Okay, making pasta is easy,
all right?

51:57.682 --> 51:59.380
Alright, just follow what I do
and we're gonna be great.

51:59.383 --> 52:00.882
Got it.

52:00.885 --> 52:08.323
<i>♪ That it's all a dream ♪</i>

52:08.326 --> 52:14.162
<i>♪ 'Cause you still look

52:14.165 --> 52:19.934
<i>♪ Even the worse ones,

52:19.937 --> 52:25.707
<i>♪ I'd stop the world

52:25.710 --> 52:27.108
A glug. How much is a glug?

52:27.111 --> 52:29.077
A glug is exactly that much.

52:29.080 --> 52:34.215
<i>♪ 'Cause when you love someone,

52:34.218 --> 52:39.621

52:39.624 --> 52:42.652
<i>♪ 'Cause when you love someone,</i>

52:42.654 --> 52:45.193

52:45.196 --> 52:48.763
<i>♪ When you love someone

52:48.766 --> 52:49.831
Ready? Dive in.

52:49.834 --> 52:50.732
No.

52:50.735 --> 52:51.866
Yes.

52:51.869 --> 52:54.035
I need a wooden spoon
or other utensil.

52:54.038 --> 52:55.570
Tell you what.

52:55.573 --> 52:57.005
These are the best utensils
that you have in the kitchen.

52:57.008 --> 52:58.039
Don't, don't do it.

52:58.042 --> 52:59.374
Yes. Feel that?

52:59.377 --> 53:01.776
Just get right in there.

53:01.779 --> 53:08.049
<i>♪ You'll probably never love
someone like I do. ♪</i>

53:08.052 --> 53:09.350
There you go.

53:09.353 --> 53:11.352
I don't understand,
what am I doing wrong?

53:11.355 --> 53:12.687
You're not doing anything wrong,

53:12.690 --> 53:15.857
you just gotta put a little
bit more love into it.

53:15.860 --> 53:18.826
<i>♪ The one til' I found you. ♪</i>

53:18.829 --> 53:20.762
What's wrong with mine?
It doesn't look like yours.

53:20.765 --> 53:23.665
That's okay. It doesn't need
to be perfect. It's just pasta.

53:23.668 --> 53:25.567
Now, from this point on,
it just needs to rest,

53:25.570 --> 53:26.968
we wrap it and rest it,

53:26.971 --> 53:28.403
and we're going to take
a little flour,

53:28.406 --> 53:30.205
and then we get to roll it out
which is the fun part.

53:30.208 --> 53:34.175
<i>♪ When you love someone,
you open up your heart ♪</i>

53:34.178 --> 53:36.211
Oh, oh, okay.
So, so how is it?

53:36.214 --> 53:40.982
You just take a little flour,
and then you roll it... out?

53:40.985 --> 53:43.851
<i>♪ If you love someone, ♪</i>

53:43.854 --> 53:46.187

53:46.190 --> 53:49.324
<i>♪ You'll probably never love

53:49.327 --> 53:51.659
Where you going? This is fun.
We're just having fun.

53:51.662 --> 53:57.098
<i>♪ You'll probably never love
someone like I do ♪</i>

53:57.101 --> 54:02.204
<i>♪ You'll probably never love

54:05.610 --> 54:07.775
Man, you never stop working,
do you?

54:07.778 --> 54:10.211
I like cleaning, it's relaxing.

54:10.214 --> 54:11.679
I can see that.

54:11.682 --> 54:13.147
You know, it's not dirty,
though,

54:13.150 --> 54:15.116
it's just got a little bit
of food on it, that's all.

54:16.454 --> 54:18.386
Don't let the health inspector
hear you say that.

54:18.389 --> 54:19.821
Okay, I won't.

54:20.992 --> 54:22.457
You do realize of course though

54:22.460 --> 54:25.693
that we have a cleaning crew
that comes in every night.

54:25.696 --> 54:27.328
Right. Yes.

54:27.331 --> 54:28.296
I knew that.

54:28.299 --> 54:29.397
Right.

54:29.400 --> 54:30.932
Oh, thank you.

54:30.935 --> 54:32.133
You're very welcome.

54:32.136 --> 54:33.635
You did good tonight,
you're a hard worker.

54:33.638 --> 54:34.736
I do my best.

54:34.739 --> 54:35.803
I was very impressed.

54:35.806 --> 54:36.904
Yeah.

54:36.907 --> 54:38.406
So cheers to that.

54:38.409 --> 54:41.676
Cheers.

54:41.679 --> 54:42.710
Mm.

54:42.713 --> 54:43.878
Mmhmm.

54:43.881 --> 54:44.979
I was thinking...

54:44.982 --> 54:46.314
Oh boy.

54:46.317 --> 54:48.650
Okay, I was going over
some of the food invoices.

54:48.653 --> 54:51.486
Wagyu beef-$110 a pound.

54:51.489 --> 54:53.488
Yeah, but that's the best beef
you can get.

54:53.491 --> 54:54.756
I know what it is.

54:54.759 --> 54:56.858
Do we need it?
That's what I'm saying.

54:56.861 --> 54:59.093
It's been on the menu
since day one.

54:59.096 --> 55:03.398
And we are going to revisit
the menu, yes?

55:03.401 --> 55:06.367
Yes, I guess so.

55:06.370 --> 55:07.902
Short ribs.

55:07.905 --> 55:10.471
They're delicious, and they're
a tenth of the price.

55:10.474 --> 55:13.042
I like short ribs.

55:14.278 --> 55:16.411
That's it?

55:16.414 --> 55:17.812
Yeah, that's all I gotta say.

55:19.216 --> 55:21.549
Oh my goodness, I think
we're actually collaborating.

55:21.552 --> 55:23.351
I think we are.

55:23.354 --> 55:24.352
Yeah.

55:24.989 --> 55:26.187
Same team, right?

55:26.190 --> 55:28.189
Same team.

55:28.192 --> 55:30.124
Okay.

55:30.127 --> 55:31.826
Short ribs.

55:35.099 --> 55:36.164
<i>Hot behind.</i>

55:36.167 --> 55:37.598
<i>Hey, how's that salad coming?</i>

55:37.601 --> 55:38.900
<i>It's coming out now.</i>

55:38.903 --> 55:40.068
<i>Almost Chef.</i>

55:40.071 --> 55:40.868
All right, fire two steaks,
one medium,

55:40.871 --> 55:41.869
one medium rare.

55:41.872 --> 55:42.737
Yes, chef.

55:42.740 --> 55:43.471
And how long on that lobster?

55:43.474 --> 55:44.238
Two minutes, chef.

55:44.241 --> 55:45.073
Good.

55:45.076 --> 55:46.507
Hey, I was thinking.

55:46.510 --> 55:47.275
Oh, don't do that, you'll get
lines on your forehead.

55:47.278 --> 55:48.176
Funny.

55:48.179 --> 55:49.410
I'll be here all night.

55:49.413 --> 55:50.678
So, you know how you're
still serving burrata

55:50.681 --> 55:52.146
with heirloom tomatoes
and basil?

55:52.149 --> 55:53.581
Yeah, it's a classic.

55:53.584 --> 55:56.050
Last month, I was at a wedding
and they served burrata

55:56.053 --> 55:57.885
with grilled
nectarines and mint.

55:57.888 --> 55:59.120
I see.

55:59.123 --> 56:00.188
Did they really?

56:00.191 --> 56:01.489
Yes, they did and
it was delicious.

56:01.492 --> 56:02.924
Mm, how delicious was it?

56:02.927 --> 56:04.959
Oh, extremely delicious.

56:04.962 --> 56:06.394
You see, I didn't know
that deliciousness

56:06.397 --> 56:08.062
could be extreme.

56:08.065 --> 56:09.430
Now you know.

56:09.433 --> 56:11.299
Uh-huh.

56:11.302 --> 56:12.233
Hear that?

56:12.236 --> 56:15.069
Burrata with grilled nectarines?

56:15.072 --> 56:16.404
Sounds good.

56:16.407 --> 56:17.605
It does sound good, doesn't it?

56:17.608 --> 56:19.374
Hey, Dad.

56:19.377 --> 56:22.276
Hey, sweetheart,
what are you doing here?

56:22.279 --> 56:23.678
Uncle Bernie picked me up,

56:23.681 --> 56:25.580
and Maggie said I could do
my homework in the office.

56:25.583 --> 56:27.048
Oh, your homework, huh?

56:27.051 --> 56:27.849
Yeah.

56:27.852 --> 56:29.784
Look at you go.

56:29.787 --> 56:30.518
I'm improving.

56:30.521 --> 56:31.652
Hey, hey, hey, come on.

56:31.655 --> 56:32.720
Well, you know what?
This...

56:32.723 --> 56:33.788
Brain food.

56:33.791 --> 56:34.622
It's the kitchen!

56:34.625 --> 56:36.524
Bye.

56:36.527 --> 56:37.625
See that?

56:37.628 --> 56:38.960
All right, I need a new salad.

56:38.963 --> 56:40.929
I can't... can't hand
that one out.

56:57.047 --> 56:58.479
That looks great on you.

56:58.482 --> 57:01.149
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry,
I just was trying it on.

57:01.152 --> 57:03.785
No, it's okay, you could
borrow it if you want.

57:03.788 --> 57:04.552
Really?

57:04.555 --> 57:05.953
Of course, yeah.

57:05.956 --> 57:07.622
Um, I wanted to talk
to you actually,

57:07.625 --> 57:10.491
because your dad said that
you designed the website

57:10.494 --> 57:11.459
for the restaurant.

57:11.462 --> 57:13.628
Yeah, it was for
a class project.

57:13.631 --> 57:15.129
Do you think you could
freshen it up a bit?

57:15.132 --> 57:17.799
Yeah, sure, but I think my dad
likes it the way it is.

57:17.802 --> 57:20.067
Well, we're making some
changes at the restaurant.

57:20.070 --> 57:23.905
New menu, new décor,
new website.

57:23.908 --> 57:25.606
So, like a restaurant makeover.

57:26.544 --> 57:28.242
Sure. Yeah, something like that.

57:28.245 --> 57:29.577
That's awesome.

57:29.580 --> 57:31.045
So, what were you thinking
for the website?

57:31.048 --> 57:32.513
Well, I'm not entirely sure,

57:32.516 --> 57:34.849
but maybe you could come up
with some ideas?

57:34.852 --> 57:35.783
Of course.

57:35.786 --> 57:37.018
And I'll pay you, of course.

57:37.021 --> 57:39.455
Oh, you don't have to worry
about that.

57:41.225 --> 57:44.325
How about I pay you in clothes?

57:44.328 --> 57:45.426
Are you serious?

57:45.429 --> 57:46.461
Sure.

57:46.464 --> 57:47.495
The restaurant's closed
on Mondays,

57:47.498 --> 57:49.063
so I could pick you up
after school,

57:49.066 --> 57:50.498
we could go shopping.

57:50.501 --> 57:53.768
That would be awesome.

57:53.771 --> 57:55.736
What if we started working
on the website now?

57:55.739 --> 57:56.971
That would be awesome.

57:58.242 --> 58:00.107
Okay, so, what were
you thinking?

58:00.110 --> 58:01.709
Like, what did you want
to change?

58:01.712 --> 58:04.145
I want it to feel modern,
streamlined, clean,

58:04.148 --> 58:07.181
and... kind of fancy?

58:08.552 --> 58:09.484
Okay.

58:09.487 --> 58:11.519
We're using blushes, and pinks,

58:11.522 --> 58:12.520
and white, and gold?

58:12.523 --> 58:13.888
I love that.

58:13.891 --> 58:15.790
Okay, so what if we changed
that to blush instead

58:15.793 --> 58:18.526
and then like did an accent
of gold there.

58:18.529 --> 58:19.528
Yes.

58:25.035 --> 58:28.236
So, what would you say that
your look says about you?

58:28.239 --> 58:30.338
That I look like
a complete geek.

58:30.341 --> 58:31.539
I want to change everything.

58:31.542 --> 58:32.607
No, not everything.

58:32.610 --> 58:36.544
You look smart and
sort of geek chic.

58:36.547 --> 58:38.579
I want to be more
chic than geek.

58:38.582 --> 58:41.816
Okay, okay, we
can work with that.

58:41.819 --> 58:43.451
What does your look
say about you?

58:43.454 --> 58:46.787
My look is business attire.

58:46.790 --> 58:48.823
I'm not quite sure that
fits with the restaurant.

58:48.826 --> 58:49.991
Hmm.

58:49.994 --> 58:52.660
I think maybe we both need
to change it up.

58:52.663 --> 58:53.761
Let's go in.

59:00.304 --> 59:04.739
<i>♪ You're something straight

59:04.742 --> 59:09.210

59:12.883 --> 59:14.081
Thank you.

59:14.084 --> 59:15.683
You're welcome.

59:22.126 --> 59:22.990
Hi.

59:22.993 --> 59:24.258
Hey!

59:24.261 --> 59:27.094
Whoa, look at you two.
You guys look fantastic.

59:27.097 --> 59:29.163
Well, we told you we were
going shopping.

59:29.166 --> 59:31.065
Yeah, but you never said
you were going to buy out

59:31.068 --> 59:31.899
the whole mall.

59:33.437 --> 59:35.303
Okay, I'm gonna go upstairs
and figure out my new wardrobe.

59:35.306 --> 59:37.171
Is there a lot to figure out?

59:37.174 --> 59:38.172
A lot.

59:38.175 --> 59:38.940
Thank you.

59:38.943 --> 59:41.042
You're welcome.

59:41.045 --> 59:43.144
Thank you so much for taking
her shopping,

59:43.147 --> 59:45.580
clearly that is not my forte.

59:45.583 --> 59:47.715
You're welcome,
it was my pleasure.

59:47.718 --> 59:48.783
So, what do I owe ya?

59:48.786 --> 59:49.951
Nothing.

59:49.954 --> 59:52.620
No, the company paid,
Hannah earned it.

59:52.623 --> 59:53.788
How'd she do that?

59:53.791 --> 59:55.957
She's redesigning the website.

59:55.960 --> 59:57.658
Oh, I can't wait to see it.

59:57.661 --> 01:00:00.261
Listen, uh, we were gonna go to
the Monday night mashup tonight

01:00:00.264 --> 01:00:02.396
and do a little research
for the frozen food line.

01:00:02.399 --> 01:00:03.764
You wanna come?

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:06.534
What's the Monday night mashup?

01:00:06.537 --> 01:00:08.569
<i>Ah, so this is it!</i>

01:00:08.572 --> 01:00:10.838
<i>So fun!</i>

01:00:10.841 --> 01:00:11.572
This is so cool.

01:00:11.575 --> 01:00:12.506
It is.

01:00:12.509 --> 01:00:13.240
Oh, great!

01:00:13.243 --> 01:00:14.508
Arturo's is here.

01:00:14.511 --> 01:00:15.509
This is my favourite,
you're gonna love it.

01:00:15.512 --> 01:00:16.477
Ooh, what's good there?

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.311
Everything.

01:00:17.314 --> 01:00:18.746
You should let my dad order.

01:00:18.749 --> 01:00:19.513
Oh.

01:00:20.684 --> 01:00:21.882
No, I usually like to order
for myself.

01:00:21.885 --> 01:00:23.784
Told ya. Control freak.

01:00:23.787 --> 01:00:25.052
I am not a control freak.

01:00:25.055 --> 01:00:26.053
Mmm.

01:00:26.056 --> 01:00:27.521
I just like things
a certain way.

01:00:27.524 --> 01:00:28.689
Oh yeah?

01:00:28.692 --> 01:00:30.024
Well then, prove it,
let me order for ya.

01:00:30.027 --> 01:00:32.760
You won't regret it, I promise.

01:00:32.763 --> 01:00:33.628
Fine. Yes.

01:00:33.631 --> 01:00:34.328
Yeah?

01:00:34.331 --> 01:00:34.962
Okay. Mmhmm.

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:35.930
Okay, great.

01:00:35.933 --> 01:00:37.264
Hey, Arturo, how you doing bud?

01:00:37.267 --> 01:00:38.165
I'm doing good, and you?

01:00:38.168 --> 01:00:39.734
Good, thank you.

01:00:39.737 --> 01:00:42.637
Look, uh, today we'll do, uh,
three enchilada mole poblano,

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.572
we'll do three tacos Al pastor,

01:00:44.575 --> 01:00:48.576
and three of the tamales
with the salsa Verde.

01:00:48.579 --> 01:00:49.377
Sure.

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:50.578
Uh, anything else?

01:00:50.581 --> 01:00:51.479
Can I have a horchata?

01:00:51.482 --> 01:00:52.246
Yes.

01:00:52.249 --> 01:00:54.215
One horchata as well.

01:00:54.218 --> 01:00:55.483
Thanks, Arturo.

01:00:55.486 --> 01:00:57.385
Oh, you're gonna love it.
It's gonna be so good.

01:00:57.388 --> 01:00:58.719
That was incredible.

01:00:58.722 --> 01:01:00.054
Mmhmm.

01:01:00.057 --> 01:01:01.255
You can always trust Dad
to pick out the best food.

01:01:01.258 --> 01:01:02.690
Always.

01:01:02.693 --> 01:01:03.958
Oh, smile!

01:01:03.961 --> 01:01:04.625
Here we go.

01:01:04.628 --> 01:01:05.693
Oh.

01:01:05.696 --> 01:01:06.394
Okay, ready?

01:01:06.397 --> 01:01:07.762
Yep.

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.231
Too goofy.

01:01:10.234 --> 01:01:10.965
What?

01:01:10.968 --> 01:01:11.766
Yes.

01:01:11.769 --> 01:01:13.134
Too what?

01:01:13.137 --> 01:01:14.568
Goofy? That wasn't that goofy,
that's just my face.

01:01:14.571 --> 01:01:15.903
No, it's goofy.

01:01:15.906 --> 01:01:19.273
This is for the Osteria
website, okay?

01:01:19.276 --> 01:01:21.442
As a story about
our research trip.

01:01:21.445 --> 01:01:23.411
You need to be a little
more serious.

01:01:23.414 --> 01:01:24.812
The what?

01:01:24.815 --> 01:01:26.180
You should see the new website.

01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:27.982
It's amazing.

01:01:27.985 --> 01:01:29.450
We're going to makeover
the restaurant.

01:01:29.453 --> 01:01:30.317
I see.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.186
What happened to saving money?

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:34.288
Well, the more frozen
food recipes you create,

01:01:34.291 --> 01:01:35.656
the more money you make.

01:01:35.659 --> 01:01:39.360
And sometimes you gotta spend
money to make money.

01:01:39.363 --> 01:01:40.261
I suppose.

01:01:40.264 --> 01:01:41.495
Everyone say "frozen pizza."

01:01:41.498 --> 01:01:42.329
All right.

01:01:42.332 --> 01:01:43.164
Oh.

01:01:43.167 --> 01:01:44.799
Frozen pizza.

01:01:47.237 --> 01:01:50.404
<i>♪ For the first time ♪</i>

01:01:50.407 --> 01:01:53.340
<i>♪ I'm waking up ♪</i>

01:02:07.858 --> 01:02:10.658
And then, I put in the order
for the new flatware...

01:02:10.661 --> 01:02:11.759
Mmhmm.

01:02:11.762 --> 01:02:12.960
The dining chairs
arrive tomorrow...

01:02:12.963 --> 01:02:14.261
Right.

01:02:14.264 --> 01:02:16.597
For the menus, I was thinking
ivory linen paper,

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:18.065
what do you think?

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:20.401
Yeah, yeah, that sounds great.

01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:22.436
Nice.

01:02:22.439 --> 01:02:24.438
Okay.

01:02:24.441 --> 01:02:26.540
Why are you agreeing
with me so easily?

01:02:26.543 --> 01:02:29.443
Uh, 'cause linen paper
sounds really nice?

01:02:30.681 --> 01:02:32.747
It's not just because I'm
slowly wearing you down

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:35.149
with all of the details?

01:02:35.152 --> 01:02:37.118
Okay, maybe just a pinch.

01:02:39.523 --> 01:02:40.621
Hey, Hank.

01:02:40.624 --> 01:02:41.489
Hey, Stu, how you doing, bud?
Good.

01:02:41.492 --> 01:02:43.124
What can I get for ya?

01:02:43.127 --> 01:02:44.658
Uh, well, today,
I'm just gonna take,

01:02:44.661 --> 01:02:46.494
uh, a dozen short ribs please.

01:02:46.497 --> 01:02:47.161
Coming right up.

01:02:47.164 --> 01:02:48.763
Thanks.

01:02:48.766 --> 01:02:50.498
Short ribs, huh?

01:02:50.501 --> 01:02:51.732
Don't gloat.

01:02:51.735 --> 01:02:52.933
It's pretty hard not to.

01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:54.769
It just... I just I think
it might work

01:02:54.772 --> 01:02:56.971
for one of the frozen food
recipes, that's all.

01:02:56.974 --> 01:02:58.939
Oh.

01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:00.341
Yeah.

01:03:00.344 --> 01:03:03.077
Look, you know, I'm just
gonna go back to my place

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:05.579
and work on some
of these recipes,

01:03:05.582 --> 01:03:08.349
I dunno, you want to join me?

01:03:08.352 --> 01:03:09.350
Sure.

01:03:09.353 --> 01:03:10.217
Yeah?

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:11.786
Yeah.

01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:13.855
Okay, cool.

01:03:15.092 --> 01:03:17.858
Okay, here we go.

01:03:17.861 --> 01:03:18.859
Mmm.

01:03:20.731 --> 01:03:23.798
You know what I was, uh,
thinking at the market?

01:03:23.801 --> 01:03:25.432
What's that?

01:03:25.435 --> 01:03:27.201
Clearly, this is a mistake
to tell you this,

01:03:27.204 --> 01:03:30.871
but um...

01:03:30.874 --> 01:03:34.175
I actually think you're
a good influence on me.

01:03:34.178 --> 01:03:35.442
No, don't be silly.

01:03:35.445 --> 01:03:36.277
No, no, no.

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:37.578
I am being serious.

01:03:37.581 --> 01:03:40.214
I've, uh, been in a bit of
a rut since Karen died,

01:03:40.217 --> 01:03:42.249
and you've pushed me outside
of my comfort zone.

01:03:42.252 --> 01:03:46.120
Made me try new things again,
and I,

01:03:46.123 --> 01:03:50.624
um, I'm very grateful
to you for that.

01:03:50.627 --> 01:03:52.259
I don't know what to say.

01:03:52.262 --> 01:03:53.994
You don't need to say anything.

01:03:53.997 --> 01:03:54.762
Okay.

01:03:54.765 --> 01:03:57.464
Why don't you just try?

01:03:57.467 --> 01:04:00.935
But, be careful,
it's really hot.

01:04:00.938 --> 01:04:02.570
It's a bit hot.

01:04:02.573 --> 01:04:04.572
Is it good?

01:04:04.575 --> 01:04:06.941
Okay.

01:04:06.944 --> 01:04:09.610
That's the best thing
I've ever tasted in my life.

01:04:09.613 --> 01:04:10.578
Thank you.

01:04:10.581 --> 01:04:13.681
No, I'm serious,
that's incredible.

01:04:13.684 --> 01:04:14.982
I'm glad you like it.

01:04:14.985 --> 01:04:16.283
I mean, it's actually
really easy,

01:04:16.286 --> 01:04:18.452
you just braise
the short ribs in,

01:04:18.455 --> 01:04:20.387
uh, some veal stock,
homemade plum wine,

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:23.624
rosemary, reduce it,
serve it over the tagliatelle.

01:04:23.627 --> 01:04:25.926
I mean, normally, I would
probably serve it over something

01:04:25.929 --> 01:04:28.896
a bit more substantial,
like a pistachio risotto

01:04:28.899 --> 01:04:30.264
or something but...

01:04:30.267 --> 01:04:32.933
But Professor Scully said rice
doesn't freeze well,

01:04:32.936 --> 01:04:36.204
so you went with the pasta.

01:04:37.441 --> 01:04:41.075
You know, you're pretty
amazing, Hank Daniels.

01:04:41.078 --> 01:04:42.943
Thank you.

01:04:42.946 --> 01:04:45.080
You're not so bad yourself.

01:04:51.021 --> 01:04:52.153
Dad?

01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:53.654
Hey.

01:04:53.657 --> 01:04:54.221
Hi, Hannah.

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:55.022
Hi.

01:04:55.025 --> 01:04:55.789
Hey.

01:04:55.792 --> 01:04:56.490
Hi.

01:04:56.493 --> 01:04:57.458
What are you guys up to?

01:04:57.461 --> 01:04:59.260
Well your dad made, um, uh,

01:04:59.263 --> 01:04:59.994
Pasta.

01:04:59.997 --> 01:05:00.895
Do you want some?

01:05:00.898 --> 01:05:02.229
No, I'm good.

01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:04.298
I actually had a question.

01:05:04.301 --> 01:05:06.066
Is this too much
for school tomorrow?

01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:08.068
Yes.
No.

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:10.237
Thank you, Maggie.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.305
Goodnight.

01:05:11.308 --> 01:05:12.539
Night.

01:05:12.542 --> 01:05:14.275
Goodnight.

01:05:14.278 --> 01:05:16.010
Good job.

01:05:16.013 --> 01:05:18.412
Good influence on me,
bad influence on her.

01:05:21.418 --> 01:05:23.050
So.

01:05:27.157 --> 01:05:29.023
I think I should go.

01:05:29.026 --> 01:05:30.157
Right.

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:32.860
Mmhmm.

01:05:34.231 --> 01:05:35.162
I will see you tomorrow.

01:05:35.165 --> 01:05:36.730
Okay.

01:05:36.733 --> 01:05:39.500
And um, I have a surprise
for you.

01:05:39.503 --> 01:05:40.968
Oh.

01:05:40.971 --> 01:05:45.239
I am really looking
forward to it.

01:05:45.242 --> 01:05:48.776
Are you making fun of me?

01:05:48.779 --> 01:05:52.880
Just a pinch.

01:05:52.883 --> 01:05:53.814
Goodnight.

01:05:53.817 --> 01:05:55.050
Goodnight.

01:06:02.693 --> 01:06:05.961
I don't know, Hank.

01:06:08.765 --> 01:06:10.998
Oh man, that is good.

01:06:11.001 --> 01:06:12.400
Mmm mm.

01:06:16.974 --> 01:06:18.539
No, not yet.

01:06:18.542 --> 01:06:20.374
Okay, how about now, 'cause
I don't like this at all.

01:06:20.377 --> 01:06:21.542
No, don't peek.

01:06:21.545 --> 01:06:23.677
Okay, I'm not.

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:26.047
Open 'em.

01:06:27.851 --> 01:06:30.484
Woah!

01:06:30.487 --> 01:06:31.652
It's incredible.

01:06:31.655 --> 01:06:32.619
It's amazing.

01:06:32.622 --> 01:06:33.887
You did all this?

01:06:33.890 --> 01:06:36.690
Well, the interior designers
did, but I helped.

01:06:38.028 --> 01:06:39.760
Oh, I have another surprise
for you, too.

01:06:39.763 --> 01:06:40.661
More?

01:06:40.664 --> 01:06:42.097
Yes.

01:06:42.899 --> 01:06:45.833
Aww, would you look at that?

01:06:45.836 --> 01:06:47.301
That's amazing.

01:06:47.304 --> 01:06:49.870
You guys look amazing, the
whole place looks incredible.

01:06:49.873 --> 01:06:51.038
Thank you.

01:06:51.041 --> 01:06:52.940
You're welcome.

01:06:52.943 --> 01:06:54.208
Look at that.

01:06:54.211 --> 01:06:56.176
Such a handsome chef.

01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:58.546
<i>You guys don't look
so bad yourselves.</i>

01:07:03.286 --> 01:07:04.551
Check it out.

01:07:18.001 --> 01:07:20.267
Chef Daniels has some
very interesting ideas

01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:22.403
about food combinations
and flavour notes.

01:07:22.406 --> 01:07:25.072
I don't care about his ideas,
Doctor Scully.

01:07:25.075 --> 01:07:27.241
Does it taste any good?

01:07:27.244 --> 01:07:28.943
Taste for yourself.

01:07:34.818 --> 01:07:36.650
Mm.

01:07:36.653 --> 01:07:38.185
That is delicious.

01:07:38.188 --> 01:07:39.219
We concur.

01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:40.154
Mmm.

01:07:40.157 --> 01:07:41.689
It's a game changer.

01:07:45.128 --> 01:07:47.461
How many of these dishes
are from Hank Daniels?

01:07:47.464 --> 01:07:48.295
All of them.

01:07:48.298 --> 01:07:49.897
And you have all the recipes?

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:52.299
Yes, we prepared them in the lab
under Chef Daniels' guidance.

01:07:52.302 --> 01:07:54.435
In fact, we, uh, got a little
inspired by him,

01:07:54.438 --> 01:07:56.703
and took his flavour notes,
played around with them a bit

01:07:56.706 --> 01:07:58.939
and came up with some
recipes of our own.

01:07:58.942 --> 01:08:01.575
Excellent work Doctor Scully.

01:08:01.578 --> 01:08:04.012
Get ready to go
into full production.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:13.220
What is this, casual Friday?

01:08:13.223 --> 01:08:15.522
Oh, um...

01:08:15.525 --> 01:08:16.590
Sit.

01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:19.093
Yeah, okay.

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:22.229
You have done a great job
with Hank Daniels.

01:08:22.232 --> 01:08:23.564
Thank you.

01:08:23.567 --> 01:08:25.332
The frozen food line is coming
along beautifully,

01:08:25.335 --> 01:08:28.035
and the restaurant
is looking great.

01:08:28.037 --> 01:08:29.970
Ah, I don't care
about the restaurant.

01:08:29.973 --> 01:08:31.604
Oh, I know, I just...

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:33.907
Eye on the prize, Maggie.

01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:37.010
Gourmet frozen food line,
that's what's important.

01:08:37.013 --> 01:08:38.479
Of course.

01:08:38.482 --> 01:08:41.814
In fact, I want you to start
focusing on a brand new

01:08:41.818 --> 01:08:43.951
gourmet frozen food line.

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:45.786
I'm thinking Spanish.

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:47.453
I went to a great tapas
restaurant last night,

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:49.089
and the chef was just...

01:08:49.091 --> 01:08:50.591
What about Hank?

01:08:50.594 --> 01:08:53.260
We don't need Hank anymore.

01:08:53.263 --> 01:08:55.429
The lab already has plenty
of recipes from Hank.

01:08:55.432 --> 01:08:57.497
They're taking his ideas
and running with them.

01:08:57.501 --> 01:09:00.567
Well, that's not right.

01:09:00.569 --> 01:09:03.303
And, we promised to help him
pay off his loan.

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:05.072
It was a step deal.

01:09:05.075 --> 01:09:06.773
We don't need Hank to perform
any more steps,

01:09:06.776 --> 01:09:09.576
and we don't need to pay
him any more money.

01:09:09.578 --> 01:09:10.743
Well, I'm sorry, Andrea.

01:09:10.747 --> 01:09:12.712
I just don't think that's fair.

01:09:12.716 --> 01:09:14.715
Hank is pouring his heart
and soul into helping us

01:09:14.718 --> 01:09:16.049
create this line.

01:09:16.051 --> 01:09:19.286
And he was paid very good
money to do so.

01:09:19.288 --> 01:09:22.221
What's gonna happen
to the restaurant?

01:09:22.225 --> 01:09:25.759
He's got employees, a daughter?

01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:28.261
Do you like this job, Maggie?

01:09:31.768 --> 01:09:33.466
Yes.

01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:34.734
Good.

01:09:34.738 --> 01:09:36.403
Then I think it's time to say
goodbye to Hank,

01:09:36.406 --> 01:09:38.773
and move on to the next chef.

01:10:17.847 --> 01:10:20.247
Ordering two lobster,
one panzanella, one ravioli.

01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:21.048
Yes, Chef!

01:10:21.051 --> 01:10:22.149
Thank you.

01:10:22.152 --> 01:10:23.150
Hey, Maggie.

01:10:23.153 --> 01:10:24.218
Hey Leo, Hey Emma.

01:10:24.221 --> 01:10:25.118
Hey, Maggie.

01:10:25.121 --> 01:10:26.386
Hey, packed house tonight, huh?

01:10:26.389 --> 01:10:27.287
I saw, yeah.

01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:28.555
It's great.

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:29.623
Can I talk to you?

01:10:29.626 --> 01:10:30.657
Yeah, sure? What's up.

01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:31.692
Service!

01:10:31.695 --> 01:10:33.427
In the office, if you
don't mind.

01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:34.795
Yeah, yeah, sure.

01:10:34.798 --> 01:10:35.596
Just give me a couple minutes,
I'll be right there.

01:10:35.599 --> 01:10:36.263
Sure.

01:10:36.266 --> 01:10:37.331
Okay.

01:10:37.334 --> 01:10:38.432
Uh, how long on that lobster,
guys?

01:10:38.435 --> 01:10:39.266
<i>Right here, Chef.</i>

01:10:39.269 --> 01:10:41.301
Excellent.

01:10:41.304 --> 01:10:42.703
Perfect lobster, Em.

01:10:42.706 --> 01:10:43.637
<i>Thank you, Chef.</i>

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.273
Service.

01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:48.575
Hey there.

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:49.176
What's up?

01:10:49.179 --> 01:10:50.244
Hey.

01:10:50.247 --> 01:10:51.979
Everything okay?

01:10:51.982 --> 01:10:53.080
Hank.

01:10:56.086 --> 01:10:58.151
You know I'm very fond of you.

01:10:58.154 --> 01:11:01.455
Oh, very fond of me?
That sounds good.

01:11:01.458 --> 01:11:05.759
'Cause, uh, truth is,
I'm pretty fond of you, too.

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:08.095
I mean, I don't generally
go around kissing people

01:11:08.098 --> 01:11:10.130
that I'm not fond of.

01:11:10.133 --> 01:11:14.701
That's what makes this so hard.

01:11:14.704 --> 01:11:17.971
Okay... Not sure I understand.

01:11:17.974 --> 01:11:20.173
Oh, come on. It can't be
all that hard.

01:11:20.176 --> 01:11:26.713
Andrea wants me to move on
to a new restaurant.

01:11:26.716 --> 01:11:28.382
I'm sorry, what?

01:11:28.385 --> 01:11:31.985
I guess there's this Spanish
chef, and, um...

01:11:31.988 --> 01:11:33.220
Another chef?

01:11:33.223 --> 01:11:35.489
I... I don't understand,
I thought we had a deal.

01:11:35.492 --> 01:11:37.824
She says "the lab
has enough recipes,"

01:11:37.827 --> 01:11:42.663
and she doesn't want to pay
you any more money.

01:11:42.666 --> 01:11:45.332
But the restaurant
is doing better, now.

01:11:45.335 --> 01:11:46.500
I know.

01:11:46.503 --> 01:11:48.268
I just... just need a
little bit more time.

01:11:48.271 --> 01:11:49.903
No, I know.

01:11:49.906 --> 01:11:52.606
And then you promised that you
would help me get my star back.

01:11:52.609 --> 01:11:54.341
I know.

01:11:54.344 --> 01:11:55.509
So, what is... what is this?

01:11:55.512 --> 01:11:57.678
Is this some kind of
game that you play?

01:11:57.681 --> 01:11:58.345
I mean you...

01:11:58.348 --> 01:11:59.513
What?

01:11:59.516 --> 01:12:00.547
You pretend that you like me,
you kiss me,

01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:02.149
you take my daughter
out shopping,

01:12:02.152 --> 01:12:05.485
and to get what, some recipes
from me for a frozen food line?

01:12:05.488 --> 01:12:06.353
What?

01:12:06.356 --> 01:12:07.187
No, I would never...

01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:08.889
And after you get 'em,

01:12:08.892 --> 01:12:10.090
you... you... you... you just dump
me and move onto the next victim?

01:12:10.093 --> 01:12:13.093
I would never do that.

01:12:13.096 --> 01:12:14.594
Is that who you think I am?

01:12:14.597 --> 01:12:16.296
I don't know who you are.

01:12:16.299 --> 01:12:19.399
Apparently, I have no idea.

01:12:19.402 --> 01:12:21.568
Look, this isn't how I wanted
things to happen,

01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:23.870
but Andrea threatened
to fire me.

01:12:23.873 --> 01:12:26.206
Should've quit.

01:12:26.209 --> 01:12:27.541
I wanted to.

01:12:27.544 --> 01:12:28.842
Believe me.

01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:31.611
That's the thing, Maggie.
I don't.

01:12:31.614 --> 01:12:36.817
How am I ever supposed to
believe anything you say again?

01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:39.119
You know what?

01:12:39.122 --> 01:12:40.687
I gotta get back
to my restaurant.

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:43.424
I'd really appreciate it if you
weren't here when I got back.

01:12:45.128 --> 01:12:46.861
Hank...

01:13:02.178 --> 01:13:03.176
So what's up, Chef?

01:13:03.179 --> 01:13:04.177
What's going on?

01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:05.112
Just one minute.

01:13:05.115 --> 01:13:06.613
What's the emergency?

01:13:06.616 --> 01:13:10.350
Okay, uh, I called this meeting
to let you all know that,

01:13:10.353 --> 01:13:13.754
um, Maggie is going
to be leaving us,

01:13:13.757 --> 01:13:16.223
and that unless we
find another investor,

01:13:16.226 --> 01:13:18.759
the bank is gonna shut us down
by the end of the month.

01:13:18.762 --> 01:13:20.394
Shut what down?

01:13:20.397 --> 01:13:21.528
The restaurant.

01:13:21.531 --> 01:13:22.195
What?

01:13:22.198 --> 01:13:23.263
Wait, what?

01:13:23.266 --> 01:13:24.264
You, you can't let
them do that, Hank.

01:13:24.267 --> 01:13:26.099
I can't pay back the loan,
Bernie.

01:13:26.102 --> 01:13:27.901
It's not up to me anymore.

01:13:27.904 --> 01:13:29.569
Maggie wouldn't
let us shut down, Dad.

01:13:29.572 --> 01:13:30.804
Andrea threatened to fire her.

01:13:30.807 --> 01:13:32.005
She said she had no choice.

01:13:32.008 --> 01:13:33.273
Well, where is she now?

01:13:33.276 --> 01:13:34.674
Well, I asked her to leave.

01:13:34.677 --> 01:13:35.509
Why?

01:13:35.512 --> 01:13:37.043
Let me get this straight.

01:13:37.046 --> 01:13:39.112
Maggie has done nothing
but fight for us,

01:13:39.115 --> 01:13:41.114
and you ask her to leave?

01:13:41.117 --> 01:13:43.083
Is that right?

01:13:43.086 --> 01:13:43.850
Well, yeah.

01:13:43.853 --> 01:13:45.452
Are you serious?

01:13:45.455 --> 01:13:49.589
Ever since she got here, Maggie
has been trying to help us.

01:13:49.592 --> 01:13:53.760
Uncle Bernie's right, Dad.

01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:55.729
I messed up, didn't I?

01:13:55.732 --> 01:13:57.064
Yeah.

01:14:01.371 --> 01:14:03.070
Yeah, you did.

01:14:40.276 --> 01:14:41.374
Hey.

01:14:41.377 --> 01:14:42.709
Hi.

01:14:42.712 --> 01:14:43.310
Um...

01:14:43.313 --> 01:14:44.979
Come in.

01:14:50.019 --> 01:14:52.919
Thank you.

01:14:52.922 --> 01:14:54.721
Uh, look, I owe you an apology.

01:14:54.724 --> 01:14:56.857
I said some awful
things earlier,

01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:58.458
and I'm really very sorry.

01:14:58.461 --> 01:15:01.628
I... I was completely
in the wrong.

01:15:01.631 --> 01:15:07.567
You have worked so hard for me,
right from the very beginning.

01:15:07.570 --> 01:15:13.206
You pushed me,
you challenged me,

01:15:13.209 --> 01:15:16.276
and it's only now that I realize
that you actually made me

01:15:16.279 --> 01:15:18.145
a better chef...

01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:22.849
and a better father,

01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:26.987
and a better man.

01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:29.956
Now I know that I am
losing my restaurant, and

01:15:31.694 --> 01:15:34.961
That hurts.

01:15:34.964 --> 01:15:37.932
But it's gonna hurt a lot more
if I lose you, too.

01:15:43.172 --> 01:15:46.706
Maybe you don't have to.

01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:49.109
Have to what?

01:15:49.112 --> 01:15:51.479
Lose either of us.

01:15:53.783 --> 01:15:57.150
Really?

01:15:57.153 --> 01:15:58.952
I have an idea.

01:15:58.955 --> 01:16:00.654
Okay?

01:16:00.657 --> 01:16:02.323
Let's talk.

01:16:12.235 --> 01:16:14.267
Why am I here?

01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:15.635
Maggie.

01:16:15.638 --> 01:16:16.803
You said it was an emergency

01:16:16.806 --> 01:16:18.905
and I have a plane to catch
in 45 minutes.

01:16:18.908 --> 01:16:22.275
Hank found someone to invest
in the restaurant.

01:16:22.278 --> 01:16:24.210
Who's going to be foolish enough
to invest in a restaurant

01:16:24.213 --> 01:16:26.279
that just lost its star?

01:16:26.282 --> 01:16:28.648
Me.

01:16:28.651 --> 01:16:30.183
I have a little money saved up.

01:16:30.186 --> 01:16:32.485
It's not a lot, but it's enough
to tide the restaurant over

01:16:32.488 --> 01:16:35.488
until it becomes
profitable again.

01:16:35.491 --> 01:16:37.123
Why would you do that?

01:16:37.126 --> 01:16:39.693
Because I believe
in the restaurant,

01:16:39.696 --> 01:16:42.762
and I believe in Hank.

01:16:42.765 --> 01:16:45.732
Then I believe you're fired.

01:16:45.735 --> 01:16:47.601
I figured.

01:16:47.604 --> 01:16:49.202
I guess that concludes our
business here

01:16:49.205 --> 01:16:50.904
this morning then Andrea.

01:16:50.907 --> 01:16:52.639
I still own your recipes.

01:16:52.642 --> 01:16:54.174
And you're welcome to them.

01:16:54.177 --> 01:16:57.210
I am grateful to you.

01:16:57.213 --> 01:16:58.778
I am.

01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:03.750
Because if it wasn't for you,
I never would've met Maggie.

01:17:03.753 --> 01:17:05.719
You two deserve each other.

01:17:05.722 --> 01:17:08.088
Yeah. I think so.

01:17:08.091 --> 01:17:11.925
We could've built a food
empire together, Maggie.

01:17:13.529 --> 01:17:15.729
You chose the wrong side.

01:17:15.732 --> 01:17:17.698
I don't think so.

01:17:21.537 --> 01:17:23.470
Thanks.

01:17:23.473 --> 01:17:25.972
What happened?

01:17:25.975 --> 01:17:28.141
Maggie just saved
the restaurant.

01:17:28.144 --> 01:17:29.009
That's what happened.

01:17:29.012 --> 01:17:30.176
I can't believe it.

01:17:30.179 --> 01:17:31.144
And there's more...

01:17:31.147 --> 01:17:32.312
Not sure I can take any more.

01:17:32.315 --> 01:17:34.347
She also called the gourmet
review guide

01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:36.483
and sent them a link to our
new website and menu.

01:17:36.486 --> 01:17:38.018
And they've agreed to come back

01:17:38.021 --> 01:17:41.721
and re-review the restaurant,
tonight.

01:17:41.724 --> 01:17:42.722
Tonight?

01:17:42.725 --> 01:17:43.790
Tonight.

01:17:43.793 --> 01:17:45.458
So, we have a lot of
work to do, people.

01:17:45.461 --> 01:17:48.094
Let's get at it.

01:17:48.097 --> 01:17:49.596
Thank you.

01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:05.740
Don't scratch it.

01:19:18.521 --> 01:19:21.054
Good evening, Mister Martin.
Welcome to Osteria.

01:19:21.057 --> 01:19:22.756
May we take your coat?

01:19:22.759 --> 01:19:25.091
I booked under the name
of Stevens.

01:19:25.094 --> 01:19:26.793
We have a new system in place
to keep track

01:19:26.796 --> 01:19:30.263
of all the best food critics
in town.

01:19:30.266 --> 01:19:33.099
May I show you to your table?

01:19:33.102 --> 01:19:34.033
Thank you.

01:19:34.036 --> 01:19:36.003
Yes, please.

01:19:39.542 --> 01:19:40.406
Hank.

01:19:40.409 --> 01:19:41.040
Yeah?

01:19:41.043 --> 01:19:42.442
Guess what?

01:19:42.445 --> 01:19:43.209
What?

01:19:43.212 --> 01:19:44.377
He ordered the short ribs.

01:19:48.151 --> 01:19:49.249
Okay, here we go.

01:19:49.252 --> 01:19:52.952
All right, guys. Listen up.

01:19:52.955 --> 01:19:54.821
Um... As you know,
the restaurant

01:19:54.824 --> 01:19:59.359
has been in a bit of
a rut recently.

01:19:59.362 --> 01:20:03.096
Well, the last four years,
actually.

01:20:03.099 --> 01:20:04.564
And that's on me.

01:20:04.567 --> 01:20:08.401
But from now on,
we aim for the stars.

01:20:08.404 --> 01:20:09.335
Yes, we do.

01:20:09.338 --> 01:20:10.336
100 percent.

01:20:12.675 --> 01:20:16.042
Last few weeks has taught me
that I've, uh, well,

01:20:16.045 --> 01:20:20.113
I've been kind of taking you
guys for granted and I have.

01:20:20.116 --> 01:20:23.149
But this isn't about me
anymore, this is about us.

01:20:23.152 --> 01:20:26.085
I love you guys, you're family.

01:20:26.088 --> 01:20:30.323
And I just know that together,
we're gonna kill it.

01:20:30.326 --> 01:20:36.296
So take your time, breathe,
and execute.

01:20:36.299 --> 01:20:39.232
Tonight we introduce the world
to the new Osteria.

01:20:40.169 --> 01:20:42.702
Yes, Chef!

01:20:42.705 --> 01:20:43.704
Let's get it done!

01:21:10.833 --> 01:21:13.434
Service.

01:21:20.309 --> 01:21:22.509
<i>Okay. Alright her we go.</i>

01:21:55.044 --> 01:21:56.042
Service.

01:21:56.045 --> 01:21:57.143
How long on that burrata?

01:21:57.146 --> 01:21:58.177
In 20 seconds, Chef.

01:21:58.180 --> 01:21:59.780
Thank you.

01:22:09.225 --> 01:22:10.990
I... I can't look.

01:22:10.993 --> 01:22:13.060
What's he doing?

01:22:15.765 --> 01:22:16.763
Smiling.

01:22:16.766 --> 01:22:17.430
Smiling?

01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:18.665
Mmhmm.

01:22:18.668 --> 01:22:19.866
Smiling how?

01:22:19.869 --> 01:22:21.501
Smiling like he's just eaten
the best thing

01:22:21.504 --> 01:22:23.202
he's ever had in his life?

01:22:23.205 --> 01:22:24.570
Really?

01:22:24.573 --> 01:22:25.571
Really.

01:22:25.574 --> 01:22:26.739
You're not messing with me?

01:22:26.742 --> 01:22:28.374
Not even a pinch.

01:22:28.377 --> 01:22:30.811
Then how come you're
so weirdly calm?

01:22:32.181 --> 01:22:33.646
Oh, that's just on the outside.

01:22:33.649 --> 01:22:34.814
Inside, I'm a mess.

01:22:36.419 --> 01:22:39.319
Yeah, me too.

01:22:39.322 --> 01:22:43.990
You know, you did
risk everything for me.

01:22:43.993 --> 01:22:45.725
Yeah, you know?

01:22:45.728 --> 01:22:47.226
You kinda got me fired?

01:22:47.229 --> 01:22:48.394
I know, I did!

01:22:48.397 --> 01:22:49.696
Uh-huh.

01:22:49.699 --> 01:22:51.230
You know, I might be able
to help you with that.

01:22:51.233 --> 01:22:52.398
Oh, really?

01:22:52.401 --> 01:22:54.400
Yeah, if you drop off
a resume tomorrow,

01:22:54.403 --> 01:22:58.705
my new partner Miss Young, she
might be able to help you out.

01:22:58.708 --> 01:23:00.006
Miss Young, huh?

01:23:00.009 --> 01:23:01.541
Mmhmm.

01:23:01.544 --> 01:23:03.309
It's Maggie.

01:23:03.312 --> 01:23:05.145
Always Maggie.
