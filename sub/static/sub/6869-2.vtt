WEBVTT

00:02.396 --> 00:03.096
Item six.

00:04.398 --> 00:05.932
Yeah, we're not done with item five!

00:06.000 --> 00:09.435
Well obviously we are,
because I just said "item six."

00:09.503 --> 00:12.689
Where the hell're we supposed to
eat lunch if you close the break room?

00:12.809 --> 00:13.943
Wherever you'd like.

00:14.011 --> 00:17.580
As long as it's not Le Cirque,
LutÃ¨ce, Elaine's, 21, The

00:17.647 --> 00:19.349
Russian Tea Room, or The Palm.

00:19.416 --> 00:21.577
Like we can afford to
eat lunch at any of those.

00:21.585 --> 00:22.118
All the better.

00:22.186 --> 00:24.720
Saves us all the embarrassment
of my snubbing you.

00:24.788 --> 00:25.221
Malory --

00:25.289 --> 00:26.722
And, shut up, it will

00:26.790 --> 00:28.724
save me God knows how much on

00:28.792 --> 00:32.161
exterminators... That
break room is disgusting.

00:32.229 --> 00:33.929
A pig wouldn't be caught dead in there.

00:33.998 --> 00:35.231
Yeah it would.

00:35.299 --> 00:38.067
- Aww, Pigley Two...
- And you!

00:38.135 --> 00:41.237
Mister "I Can Solve Your Ant Problem!"

00:41.305 --> 00:44.207
First of all, it's Doctor
"I Can Solve Your Ant Problem"...

00:51.581 --> 00:54.417
And second of all, here's your refund.

00:54.485 --> 00:55.951
I really thought that would work.

00:56.020 --> 01:00.756
What were you going for, ant-strength
relative to the size of a human?

01:00.824 --> 01:01.391
Shut up.

01:01.458 --> 01:05.728
Everyone shut up, because item six!

01:05.795 --> 01:09.865
Talk to Pam today, because somehow,
and seemingly impossibly soon, it is

01:09.933 --> 01:13.036
once again time for... peer reviews.

01:13.103 --> 01:14.470
Yaaayyyy!

01:14.538 --> 01:15.938
Ugh, how can you not hate those?

01:16.006 --> 01:18.774
I dunno, maybe I'm the only
one who cares about this being

01:18.842 --> 01:20.743
an efficient and supportive
work environment...

01:20.810 --> 01:21.644
Maybe you're lame.

01:21.711 --> 01:23.779
Maybe you can shut
your dick-holster.

01:23.847 --> 01:26.815
So see me after, I've got
everyone paired off.

01:26.883 --> 01:28.084
Well, except Ms. Archer.

01:28.152 --> 01:29.792
Wait, why don't you have to do it?

01:29.853 --> 01:33.756
Well I would... if I had
a peer in this entire building.

01:33.823 --> 01:35.624
Item seven.

01:35.692 --> 01:36.092
Oh.

01:36.160 --> 01:39.495
You all remember Lucas Troy...

01:39.563 --> 01:40.714
- Shitbag.

01:40.715 --> 01:41.864
- What're you talking
about, Luke's awesome!

01:41.932 --> 01:47.803
He's a kickass agent, a great wingman,
he can drink Ireland under the table...

01:47.871 --> 01:50.506
back when we were training
together we tore it up!

01:50.574 --> 01:52.175
Just like his ISIS contract!

01:52.242 --> 01:54.677
I trained him for a year, and
the minute he's worth a damn he

01:54.744 --> 01:56.812
goes to work for ODIN?!

01:56.880 --> 01:59.215
She said, oversimplifyingly!

01:59.283 --> 01:59.915
Wh-?!

01:59.983 --> 02:04.420
And so, congratulations to all our
new agents, but especially to our

02:04.488 --> 02:07.756
highest-scoring recruit, Lucas Troy!

02:08.858 --> 02:10.126
Way to go Luke!

02:10.193 --> 02:13.463
I'm going to work for ODIN.

02:13.530 --> 02:14.863
He was still awesome.

02:14.931 --> 02:15.831
And my best --

02:15.899 --> 02:16.299
Only --

02:16.366 --> 02:17.300
shut up, my best

02:17.367 --> 02:20.136
friend, Mother, which is why you
hated him, because you were

02:20.204 --> 02:23.439
jealous of our relationship.

02:23.507 --> 02:26.175
- So, you two were in a relationship...
Wh-?

02:26.243 --> 02:28.478
No, not the Ray kind!

02:28.545 --> 02:28.978
Meaning?

02:29.045 --> 02:30.846
Homosexual, Ray.

02:30.914 --> 02:32.848
So, so obviously.

02:32.916 --> 02:36.285
What's not obvious, Mother, is why my
best friend, the awesome Luke Troy,

02:36.353 --> 02:38.154
is on your stupid agenda!

02:38.222 --> 02:43.910
Oh, right, let's see here...
Doo doo doo dooo... oh.

02:44.157 --> 02:46.025
He's dead.

02:46.743 --> 02:47.893
He's... what?

02:48.013 --> 02:49.031
Dead!

02:49.099 --> 02:52.795
Jesus, clean the secretly gay for
Lucas Troy out of your ears.

03:27.837 --> 03:29.858
This is crazy,
how could Luke be --

03:29.978 --> 03:31.606
- Gay?
- Dead! Lana.

03:31.674 --> 03:34.943
And your little, whatever, gay
innuendos don't even merit a --

03:35.011 --> 03:36.445
Reach-around?

03:36.513 --> 03:38.447
Owww! Jesus!

03:38.515 --> 03:39.316
Ha ha!

03:39.349 --> 03:42.617
It's just like my birthday
party all over again.

03:42.685 --> 03:43.485
Remember?

03:43.553 --> 03:44.319
Nooo!

03:44.387 --> 03:44.853
Yeah.

03:44.921 --> 03:46.255
Because you weren't invited.

03:46.322 --> 03:48.623
Mother, tell me exactly what happened!

03:48.691 --> 03:51.726
To lure a black market
arms dealer into the open,

03:51.794 --> 03:54.796
Troy was posing as a nuclear
scientist who had stolen enough

03:54.864 --> 03:56.798
uranium for a dirty bomb.

03:56.866 --> 03:59.801
Oh, that is classic Luke the Spook!

03:59.869 --> 04:05.240
Hey stupid, here's your fake uranium,
click, handcuffs, drops mic on stage.

04:05.308 --> 04:06.808
Yes, that was the plan.

04:06.876 --> 04:10.446
But somehow, thanks to what I
just assume is ODIN idiocy,

04:10.513 --> 04:12.581
Troy acquired real uranium.

04:12.648 --> 04:13.815
Even classic-er!

04:13.883 --> 04:16.452
The bad guys would obviously
bring a Geiger counter!

04:16.519 --> 04:19.019
And ten million
dollars in bearer bonds.

04:19.089 --> 04:23.058
And when the smoke had cleared,
four ODIN agents were dead, and

04:23.126 --> 04:26.528
the uranium, the bad guys, and
the money had all disappeared.

04:26.596 --> 04:27.596
And so had Troy.

04:27.663 --> 04:28.930
Doesn't... prove anything.

04:28.998 --> 04:30.966
Oh for -- Archer, if it
walks like a duck, and quacks

04:31.033 --> 04:34.136
like a duck, and murders a
bunch of its fellow ducks...

04:34.204 --> 04:37.038
Then maybe the duck
knew there was a mole!

04:37.107 --> 04:38.474
Ever think of that?!

04:38.541 --> 04:40.842
That maybe there's a
fox in the henhouse?!

04:40.910 --> 04:42.844
A wolf in sheep's clothing?!

04:42.912 --> 04:44.846
Or one of the other tricky animals?!

04:44.914 --> 04:46.381
Well, we'll never know.

04:46.449 --> 04:48.783
The plane he escaped in
crashed, in Vermont.

04:48.851 --> 04:51.886
What, no, I bet he faked his
own death so he can expose the mole!

04:51.954 --> 04:54.456
There is no mole, and faked it how?

04:54.524 --> 04:56.458
Paging Dr. Cooper!

04:56.526 --> 04:57.993
Dr. D.B. Cooper!

04:58.060 --> 05:00.996
Lana, he obviously bailed out and --
And then...

05:01.063 --> 05:04.466
landed safely, buried his
chute, ran ten miles to the

05:04.534 --> 05:08.303
crash site and then strapped himself
into the still-burning wreckage?

05:08.371 --> 05:10.639
That... that could be anybody.

05:10.706 --> 05:12.974
Well, anybody with his dental records.

05:13.042 --> 05:13.675
What?!

05:13.743 --> 05:18.180
Yes, Sterling, I'm --
actually no, I'm not sorry.

05:18.248 --> 05:21.550
He was a traitor and a thief,
and so I'm glad he's dead.

05:21.618 --> 05:22.384
If he is!

05:22.452 --> 05:25.887
Because you've always been
insanely jealous of my friends!

05:29.725 --> 05:32.694
So if you'll excuse me,
Mother, I have to go clear

05:32.762 --> 05:36.398
the name of an American hero.

05:36.466 --> 05:39.934
Does he seem... almost
a little too fond of Troy?

05:40.002 --> 05:42.371
Yeah, and you know he was gay, right?

05:42.438 --> 05:43.772
As a tangerine.

05:43.839 --> 05:45.774
In jean shorts.

05:45.841 --> 05:47.682
But, I thought Troy was already dead.

05:47.743 --> 05:49.711
Because he wants you to think that!

05:49.779 --> 05:53.014
But I have a list of all his
known aliases, so see if any of

05:53.082 --> 05:54.749
them used a passport!

05:54.817 --> 05:56.218
Oh, or a credit card!

05:56.286 --> 05:57.919
Yeah, like at roughtrade dot net.

05:57.987 --> 06:00.755
Lana, I will hire Kenny
Loggins to come here and

06:00.823 --> 06:03.925
play an acoustic set while I
slap some sense into you.

06:03.993 --> 06:04.560
Pff.

06:04.627 --> 06:05.467
Ray, back me up here.

06:05.495 --> 06:07.929
Luke Troy, yes or no, gayest dude ever.

06:07.997 --> 06:09.698
Uh...

06:12.302 --> 06:13.935
Dude, what, it was just the tip!

06:14.003 --> 06:18.540
Meathead fratboy asshole jock
maybe, but no, definitely not gay.

06:18.608 --> 06:19.641
What?!

06:19.709 --> 06:21.943
Boom!

06:22.011 --> 06:23.044
Sorry.

06:23.112 --> 06:24.112
What.

06:24.180 --> 06:24.946
What?!

06:25.014 --> 06:25.914
I knew it!

06:25.981 --> 06:26.981
Where is he?!

06:27.049 --> 06:30.252
And why don't we leave the
terrace door open, Woodhouse?!

06:30.320 --> 06:32.954
Exactly, because he's a frickin lemur!

06:33.022 --> 06:34.623
Ray, call me when you find a lead!

06:34.691 --> 06:38.727
I'll be somewhere in or on top of my
building, shooting tranquilizer darts at

06:38.794 --> 06:40.462
the world's shittiest pet.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.063
Told him when he bought it.

06:42.131 --> 06:44.766
And I'm telling you these
reviews are mandatory, and

06:44.834 --> 06:46.954
- since I outrank you...
- Hang on, lemme check this

06:46.969 --> 06:49.471
imaginary list of all the
people I report to...

06:49.472 --> 06:51.973
Doo doo doo doo dooooo...

06:52.041 --> 06:52.608
Okay.

06:52.675 --> 06:53.308
What the hell is this?

06:53.376 --> 06:56.278
This, mustache on a penis, is Rodney.

06:56.346 --> 07:00.415
And since there's only one name
on this list, you must be Ms. Archer.

07:00.483 --> 07:02.684
Cleverly disguised as a large man.

07:02.752 --> 07:03.619
Meh-heh!

07:03.686 --> 07:06.288
He's the new, whatever, gun librarian.

07:06.356 --> 07:07.989
Armory supervisor.

07:08.057 --> 07:09.558
Hooray, what's with the cage?

07:09.626 --> 07:13.428
Oh, some wacky new thing the kids
are doing, called inventory control?

07:13.496 --> 07:17.999
Ms. Archer's pissed cause a buncha
guns and stuff keep going missing...

07:18.768 --> 07:21.336
Oh, and lemme know
if you want a good deal on a

07:21.404 --> 07:22.771
gallon of irradiated ants.

07:22.838 --> 07:23.605
Well, whatever.

07:23.673 --> 07:26.007
I need some range time, so just
scuttle back into the tiny

07:26.075 --> 07:28.443
little domain over which you
have power, and get me a

07:28.511 --> 07:30.545
thousand rounds of nine mil, wadcutter.

07:30.613 --> 07:31.446
Absolutely.

07:31.514 --> 07:34.483
Just fill out these requisition
forms, in triplicate.

07:34.550 --> 07:34.983
Wh-?

07:35.050 --> 07:36.485
For a few lousy bullets?!

07:36.552 --> 07:40.021
Well one, they're excellent bullets--
Are you gonna stand there,

07:40.089 --> 07:42.891
in what I just assume are
two-inch lifts, and tell me

07:42.958 --> 07:46.662
Archer filled out your stupid forms
just to get a tranquilizer gun?

07:46.729 --> 07:47.763
No I am not.

07:47.830 --> 07:48.196
Well?!

07:48.264 --> 07:52.301
He filled them out to get,
doo doo dooooo, two H&K MP-five,

07:52.368 --> 07:55.036
two thousand rounds ammunition
for same, twenty mark-two

07:55.104 --> 07:56.471
fragmentation grenade...

07:56.539 --> 07:57.038
Wait a minute...

07:57.106 --> 07:59.308
Yeah, that lemur is hosed.

07:59.375 --> 08:02.043
Fourteen days survival
ration, two night vision goggle,

08:02.111 --> 08:06.648
two each arctic camouflage parka
and pant, and, doo doo doo doooo,

08:06.716 --> 08:08.049
two pairs snowshoe.

08:08.117 --> 08:09.250
Son of a bitch!

08:09.319 --> 08:13.254
That phone call was --
Loooooooooooooooke!

08:13.323 --> 08:16.325
Dude, I knew you faked your
death because a mole framed you

08:16.392 --> 08:18.092
for stealing that uranium!

08:18.160 --> 08:21.196
Dude, that is such a relief, I was
worried they turned you against me.

08:21.263 --> 08:22.130
Are you kidding?

08:22.198 --> 08:26.067
Dude, bros before... apparent
threats to national security.

08:26.135 --> 08:27.932
Archer, you sure you're up for this?

08:28.057 --> 08:29.690
Because this thing... it runs deep.

08:29.758 --> 08:31.892
Dude, I love deep Said your mom!

08:31.961 --> 08:33.061
Haa!

08:33.128 --> 08:34.062
Classic you!

08:34.129 --> 08:36.697
Allright, GPS says I'll
be there in four hours.

08:36.765 --> 08:38.698
Don't worry, Luke... I'm coming for you.

08:40.202 --> 08:40.835
What was that?

08:40.902 --> 08:42.183
Phrasing.

08:42.304 --> 08:43.360
Nice!

08:43.582 --> 08:45.373
Queer!

08:45.441 --> 08:47.808
Wait a -- oh my God, holy shit!

08:47.876 --> 08:49.377
No, Vermont has liquor stores.

08:49.445 --> 08:50.695
Right?

08:50.815 --> 08:53.982
Yeah they have to, it sucks there.

08:55.672 --> 08:57.306
Cyril, not now.

08:57.373 --> 08:59.541
What's the signal strength
on Archer's cellphone?

08:59.610 --> 09:02.144
The doohickey says he's
about thirty minutes away.

09:02.212 --> 09:04.880
And my point was, we could've
easily done it by now.

09:04.948 --> 09:07.282
And my point, is that
pursuing a dangerous rogue

09:07.350 --> 09:11.353
agent, isn't the optimal
time to do peer reviews!

09:11.421 --> 09:13.222
Coulda done it ten times by now.

09:13.289 --> 09:15.357
God damn it fine frickin review me!

09:15.425 --> 09:16.786
Section one, Team Dynamics.

09:16.793 --> 09:19.662
Question one, "Does
employee cooperate with..."

09:19.730 --> 09:25.400
Oh. These are all "Strongly Disagree."

09:25.468 --> 09:28.638
You --
Pussy!

09:28.705 --> 09:30.205
Shut up, it went down wrong.

09:30.273 --> 09:32.642
Said your... oh.

09:32.709 --> 09:34.309
Yeah, doesn't work there.

09:34.377 --> 09:36.879
Mmmmokay, say
"Thanks for coming."

09:36.947 --> 09:37.467
Nooope!

09:37.480 --> 09:40.750
No, seriously, if anybody finds
out I helped you I'll be disavowed.

09:40.817 --> 09:41.383
I know.

09:41.451 --> 09:42.584
Dude, I know.

09:42.653 --> 09:43.252
Thank you.

09:43.319 --> 09:44.053
For...?

09:44.121 --> 09:44.453
Nope.

09:44.521 --> 09:45.387
God, what a dick.

09:45.455 --> 09:46.388
Said your mom!

09:46.456 --> 09:46.956
Boom!

09:46.990 --> 09:47.590
Dammit!

09:47.624 --> 09:48.290
So easy...

09:48.358 --> 09:49.391
Okay, I got an El Camino

09:49.459 --> 09:50.592
full of rampage here,

09:50.661 --> 09:52.327
so what's the plan?

09:52.395 --> 09:55.397
Right, yes, okay, so, I know
it doesn't look like much now...

09:55.465 --> 09:58.367
But it has tons of potential.

09:58.434 --> 10:02.571
As a... base of operations while
we track down the mole who framed

10:02.639 --> 10:06.408
you for murdering your colleagues and
selling uranium on the black market?

10:06.476 --> 10:07.543
No, asshole.

10:07.610 --> 10:09.344
As a bed-and-breakfast.

10:09.412 --> 10:11.213
- Uhh...
- Twin Oaks.

10:11.281 --> 10:12.114
You like that?

10:12.182 --> 10:13.115
For the name?

10:13.183 --> 10:15.584
Twin Oaks?

10:15.652 --> 10:16.752
Seriously?

10:16.820 --> 10:20.756
Yeah, according to the doohickey
it says Archer's in that direction --

10:20.824 --> 10:22.091
Are you reading it wrong?

10:22.159 --> 10:23.480
Within two hundred meters.

10:23.526 --> 10:24.760
I bet you're reading it wrong.

10:24.828 --> 10:26.428
Section two, Interpersonal.

10:26.496 --> 10:29.965
"Does employee frequently
criticize oth --"

10:30.033 --> 10:32.301
Strongly agree.

10:32.368 --> 10:33.435
Somewhat disagree?

10:33.503 --> 10:34.436
Somewhat shut up.

10:34.504 --> 10:36.638
Come on, we're going on
foot, through the woods.

10:36.707 --> 10:38.574
I've got a bad feeling about this.

10:38.641 --> 10:41.443
I know, but imagine it all fixed up!

10:41.511 --> 10:44.413
No, yeah, I mean obviously it's --
It's gonna be amazing,

10:44.480 --> 10:46.082
dude, look at these floors!

10:46.149 --> 10:46.989
That's heart of pine!

10:47.050 --> 10:50.285
Yeah, so look --
Look at this mantelpiece!

10:50.353 --> 10:51.253
Mahogany!

10:51.321 --> 10:52.454
There's another seven!

10:52.522 --> 10:55.557
Eight fireplaces, dude,
how nuts is that?!

10:55.625 --> 10:58.427
- Pretty nuts...
- Said your mom!

10:58.494 --> 11:02.732
Yeahhh... so, um, about
un-framing you for treason and murder...

11:02.799 --> 11:06.468
Yeah, I dunno, man, it kinda
seems like what's the point, you know?

11:06.536 --> 11:08.270
I don't, actually.

11:08.338 --> 11:10.439
C'mon, there's too much evidence!

11:10.506 --> 11:12.708
- I mean it's all fake, obviously, but...
- Exactly!

11:12.776 --> 11:14.777
Dude, there's a mole in your agency!

11:14.845 --> 11:15.745
We gotta catch him!

11:15.812 --> 11:16.979
But then what?

11:17.047 --> 11:20.916
Then there's another mole, or a
double agent, on and on, it's

11:20.984 --> 11:22.684
all just secrets and lies, man!

11:22.753 --> 11:24.820
Yeah, it's espionage.

11:24.888 --> 11:27.957
I can't go back to that
world, man, I'm too tired.

11:28.024 --> 11:31.861
Hopefully that's just neurological
damage from scraping lead paint...

11:31.928 --> 11:32.494
No, it's --

11:32.562 --> 11:33.483
Because turning

11:33.529 --> 11:34.496
the Munsters' house into a B&B

11:34.564 --> 11:37.733
is an insane response to your situation!

11:37.801 --> 11:41.203
It'd be cheaper to build a brand
new house out of actual money!

11:41.271 --> 11:43.639
Yeah, I know it'll cost
a fortune to fix her up,

11:43.706 --> 11:45.141
but money's not a problem.

11:45.208 --> 11:48.343
Why, wait, why is money not a problem?

11:48.411 --> 11:52.648
And my situation, is anyone who
could hurt me thinks I'm already dead.

11:52.715 --> 11:55.484
I -- wait, and
who was in the plane?

11:55.551 --> 11:55.851
Hm?

11:55.919 --> 12:01.523
I said who was in the goddamn--
No no no no, what the hell?!

12:01.591 --> 12:02.992
How could you not see that?!

12:03.059 --> 12:06.061
Because I only have two eyes, and
they were busy looking for hunters!

12:06.129 --> 12:08.530
Why, is it pumpkin season?!

12:08.598 --> 12:10.065
Is that a thing?!

12:10.133 --> 12:11.613
Archer, were you followed here?

12:11.668 --> 12:14.469
Wow, okay, a little insulting.

12:14.537 --> 12:17.539
I think I know how to spot a tail, so --
Is your... phone on?!

12:17.607 --> 12:18.573
Wh-? No!

12:18.641 --> 12:24.546
Jesus, what kind of... wallpaper
are you thinking about?

12:24.614 --> 12:28.517
Because how about a textile?

12:28.584 --> 12:29.518
Lana, listen.

12:29.585 --> 12:30.853
No, you listen!

12:30.921 --> 12:33.155
We're --

12:33.223 --> 12:35.590
Ha ha haa! Leave it!

12:35.658 --> 12:39.261
The voice mailbox of...

12:39.329 --> 12:40.062
Is full.

12:40.130 --> 12:42.764
Goodbye.

12:42.833 --> 12:46.601
Why is Lana Kane -- and is that
the geeky little accountant dude?!

12:46.669 --> 12:48.537
-- attempting to breach my perimeter?!

12:48.604 --> 12:52.274
I honestly don't know, but
why are -- you doing that?

12:52.342 --> 12:54.503
Because they are a threat.
No they're not!

12:54.510 --> 12:55.577
To our future together.

12:55.645 --> 12:57.579
Especially not Cyril!

12:57.647 --> 13:00.382
He's -- wait, I'm sorry,
whose future together?

13:00.450 --> 13:02.584
Yours and mine, dumbass.

13:02.652 --> 13:03.953
You lost me.

13:04.020 --> 13:06.588
No, Archer, I thought I had--
No, yeah, you did.

13:06.656 --> 13:08.190
but then you came back to me.

13:08.258 --> 13:09.959
Don't take this the wrong way?

13:10.026 --> 13:13.595
But I'm getting an extremely gay vibe.

13:13.663 --> 13:14.029
Wh-?

13:14.097 --> 13:16.098
Jesus, dude, I'm not gay!

13:16.166 --> 13:17.599
I --
For other men!

13:17.667 --> 13:18.600
Lost me again.

13:18.668 --> 13:19.768
I can't really explain it?

13:19.836 --> 13:22.537
I mean, you know me, I've banged
more hot chicks than I've

13:22.605 --> 13:26.876
had hot dinners, but...
There's just something about you.

13:26.943 --> 13:28.543
That... makes you gay for me?

13:28.611 --> 13:30.251
Well, I don't really like that word?

13:30.280 --> 13:32.214
Well sorry, I didn't invent English.

13:32.282 --> 13:35.417
It's more like... a
singular samesex attraction.

13:35.485 --> 13:40.622
- Can I, um, my head's kinda spinning...
- I know, this is a lot to process.

13:40.690 --> 13:42.491
No, literally.

13:42.558 --> 13:43.926
Well, figuratively.

13:43.994 --> 13:47.897
- If it was literally...
- The wine... you drugged the wine?

13:47.964 --> 13:51.233
Yeah, sorry, I thought you might
freak out when I told you all this.

13:51.301 --> 13:56.171
- Pfff, sunnersannable, I'd do me...
- And also when I told you I

13:56.239 --> 14:00.075
actually did steal the uranium
and murder my fellow agents.

14:00.143 --> 14:02.945
- You dick...
- To fund our life together, dude!

14:03.013 --> 14:06.448
Which will start right after I
go murder your fellow agents.

14:06.516 --> 14:08.579
Way way way way, hang on.

14:08.699 --> 14:12.080
You had same wine, how you not get drug?

14:12.200 --> 14:13.837
Coated the inside of the glass.

14:13.957 --> 14:15.222
Heh!

14:15.342 --> 14:17.821
Classic you!

14:21.157 --> 14:23.891
Well this is a frickin disaster!

14:23.959 --> 14:24.725
I know.

14:24.793 --> 14:28.733
When Ron said we were going on a
cruise, I almost vomited blood.

14:28.853 --> 14:31.521
No. Nobody's doing
their peer reviews!

14:31.589 --> 14:33.422
Pam, the word "disaster"

14:33.491 --> 14:35.692
implies it's something
that actually matters.

14:35.759 --> 14:36.993
It matters to me!

14:37.060 --> 14:38.862
Well, but you don't.

14:38.929 --> 14:41.498
Well then maybe instead of
doing my job I'll go hang out

14:41.565 --> 14:44.501
in Vermont with Luke Troy
and all the other assholes!

14:44.568 --> 14:46.102
What?!

14:46.169 --> 14:47.236
Oops.

14:47.304 --> 14:50.373
Trace Sterling's phone, and
scramble every available field agent!

14:50.440 --> 14:53.142
I want them all converging
on his location!

14:53.210 --> 14:55.879
- They... kinda already are...
- There's only like

14:55.946 --> 14:56.379
two of 'em.

14:56.446 --> 14:59.415
So why are these damn
peer reviews so hard?!

14:59.483 --> 15:05.588
Only like ten people work in this
whole goddamn chickenshit outfit!

15:05.656 --> 15:06.255
Sorry.

15:06.323 --> 15:07.244
Don't be.

15:07.290 --> 15:09.358
It is a chickenshit outfit.

15:09.426 --> 15:10.793
Look, for your information?

15:10.861 --> 15:14.731
Blaze orange is the safest color to wear
to avoid being accidentally shot at.

15:14.798 --> 15:18.701
What about intentionally shot at?!

15:18.769 --> 15:23.439
- Oh man, this is almost too easy...
- Oh for -- seriously?!

15:23.507 --> 15:26.275
Yeah, gotta give 'em a head start.

15:26.343 --> 15:29.079
One Sterling Archer,
two Sterling Archer...

15:29.080 --> 15:31.814
Ooh, Sterling Archer-Troy.

15:31.882 --> 15:33.616
We can take each other's names.

15:33.684 --> 15:36.218
I'd be --
Luuuuke!

15:36.286 --> 15:38.755
C'mon, you're not thinking straight!

15:38.822 --> 15:44.393
A, you wildly underestimated my
liver's ability to metabolize toxins!

15:44.461 --> 15:48.798
And B, why would you possibly have these?

15:48.866 --> 15:51.768
Because I'm not the idiot
who took his idiot clothes off!

15:51.835 --> 15:54.236
Just your jacket, c'mon, I'm freezing!

15:54.304 --> 15:55.304
No!

15:55.372 --> 16:00.309
I am gonna give you the worst
peer review in the history of... them!

16:02.846 --> 16:03.613
Hey, Lana!

16:03.681 --> 16:04.447
Where's Archer?!

16:04.514 --> 16:05.314
Did you kill him?!

16:05.382 --> 16:06.415
He's fine.

16:06.483 --> 16:07.650
Unlike your aim.

16:07.718 --> 16:09.652
Guess you never learned
how to shoot, huh?

16:09.720 --> 16:10.319
What?!

16:10.387 --> 16:11.187
First of all!

16:11.254 --> 16:11.921
Shitass!

16:11.989 --> 16:13.255
Or take criticism.

16:13.323 --> 16:14.323
Strongly agree.

16:14.391 --> 16:15.858
And from where?

16:15.926 --> 16:17.293
Under.

16:17.360 --> 16:17.627
Wear.

16:17.695 --> 16:19.328
What was it we used to call you?

16:19.396 --> 16:20.329
Truckasaurus?

16:20.397 --> 16:21.197
Cyril?

16:21.264 --> 16:24.533
No, it was...
oh yeah, Spray-and-Pray!

16:26.403 --> 16:27.036
Dammit!

16:27.104 --> 16:28.705
We also called you Shirley Temper.

16:28.739 --> 16:29.973
Uh, Cyril?

16:30.040 --> 16:31.641
Which, ya know, lame.

16:31.709 --> 16:33.409
But accurate.

16:33.477 --> 16:36.345
Again, unlike your aim.

16:36.413 --> 16:38.514
Which is why I always thought
it was weird that you only ever

16:38.582 --> 16:40.349
carried two magazines.

16:40.417 --> 16:43.352
Section three, Organization Skills!

16:43.420 --> 16:43.753
Cyril!

16:43.821 --> 16:46.589
"Employee is often
unprepared for important meetings!"

16:46.657 --> 16:48.357
Strongly agree!

16:48.425 --> 16:50.359
You left your gun in a pile of clothes!

16:50.427 --> 16:51.861
Because I had nowhere to put it!

16:51.929 --> 16:56.532
And yet you found room for a twentypage
wad of Pam's stupid peer review!

16:56.600 --> 16:59.235
It's important to her!

16:59.302 --> 17:04.339
Okay, so... Don't really
know what to make of that.

17:04.406 --> 17:07.810
Unless... Wait, no, get
it out of your head.

17:07.877 --> 17:11.180
Predator only hunts in tropical jungles.

17:11.248 --> 17:12.414
I assume.

17:12.482 --> 17:14.349
And desperately hope.

17:15.452 --> 17:17.386
Dammit!

17:20.589 --> 17:21.223
Well?!

17:21.290 --> 17:22.692
Have you found Sterling?!

17:22.760 --> 17:24.400
Well his phone's in this house.

17:24.461 --> 17:27.896
It's about twenty miles north of
Bennington, so I assume it's a B&B.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.398
Well, you would know.

17:29.466 --> 17:32.935
And if you want to keep those teeth,
missy, you won't suck them at me!

17:33.003 --> 17:35.905
- You know...
- Shut up, have you tried calling him?!

17:36.506 --> 17:39.876
Ha ha haa! Leave it!

17:39.943 --> 17:40.409
Yes.

17:40.477 --> 17:42.879
- The voice mailbox of...
- You could've just said

17:42.946 --> 17:45.048
so, you little -- Alright!

17:45.115 --> 17:47.016
I swear to God, you people?

17:47.084 --> 17:48.804
Just say the word on the nerve gas.

17:48.852 --> 17:54.356
Feel like I owe you a freebie after
the whole ant-Krieger thing.

17:54.424 --> 17:57.426
I can't, go anymore, can't do it.

17:57.494 --> 17:59.428
Section Four, Running.

17:59.496 --> 18:01.831
Employee sucks ass at it.

18:01.899 --> 18:03.199
Strongly agree.

18:03.266 --> 18:04.400
Lana?!

18:04.467 --> 18:05.434
Little geek dude?!

18:05.502 --> 18:10.873
My only regret, is I won't, get
to turn this in, because it is scathing.

18:10.941 --> 18:13.442
That can't possibly,
be your only regret.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.277
Well there's dating you.

18:15.345 --> 18:18.547
Actually no, that was... far and away the
best thing that ever happened to me.

18:18.615 --> 18:23.019
So as much as I'd like to, I don't
think now's an optimal time for that.

18:23.087 --> 18:25.121
Aww, really?

18:25.189 --> 18:27.590
- I mean, if you think we have time...
- Cyril!

18:27.657 --> 18:28.157
Ahh!

18:28.158 --> 18:29.458
Yeah we don't have time!

18:29.526 --> 18:31.460
Not for this, dickbrain.

18:31.528 --> 18:32.161
For that.

18:32.229 --> 18:36.065
What, what is... oh. Ohh, okay!

18:36.133 --> 18:37.054
But do get naked.

18:37.067 --> 18:37.934
Panties too.

18:38.001 --> 18:39.468
Yeah, they're called briefs?

18:39.536 --> 18:42.338
Yeah, you're a grown man?

18:42.405 --> 18:44.473
Yeah, that's our Lana.

18:44.541 --> 18:48.611
Let's see, so judging from the shell
ejection she was firing at...

18:48.678 --> 18:51.647
What I really hope was not an ent.

18:51.715 --> 18:55.351
Because that is like the
last thing we need.

18:55.418 --> 18:56.485
An entmoot.

18:56.553 --> 18:59.922
Oh my God what if I'm gay for Tolkien?

18:59.990 --> 19:00.623
Dude.

19:00.690 --> 19:03.292
Seriously, not that it's gonna
matter in thirty seconds...

19:03.360 --> 19:04.627
But what is your problem?

19:04.694 --> 19:08.097
- Well, besides Lana ditching me...
- For what, an entmoot?

19:08.165 --> 19:10.266
Ya know, cause she's got
those big-ass tree-hands?

19:10.333 --> 19:12.601
I'd have to go with hypothermia.

19:12.669 --> 19:15.938
- Well, I know a cure for that...
- Oh my God, not in my face!

19:16.006 --> 19:18.141
Said your mom, BOOM!

19:18.208 --> 19:20.643
Sorry, that's terrible to
hear that right before you...

19:20.710 --> 19:22.444
What in the... hell... is...?

19:22.512 --> 19:24.013
Well, you know what they say.

19:24.081 --> 19:26.515
Big hands... Big dick.

19:26.583 --> 19:28.517
Noooooooooo!

19:30.720 --> 19:32.121
- Ew.
- Gross.

19:32.189 --> 19:32.789
Luke?!

19:32.856 --> 19:33.355
Archer?!

19:33.423 --> 19:34.824
Shut up, Luke?!

19:34.892 --> 19:35.825
Archer?

19:35.893 --> 19:37.326
Oh dude, is it bad?

19:37.394 --> 19:40.263
There's a... kind of
a lot of blood down there.

19:40.330 --> 19:41.530
Said your mom.

19:41.598 --> 19:42.665
Oh my God, I'm sorry.

19:42.732 --> 19:43.532
Seriously.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.067
No, for everything.

19:45.135 --> 19:49.672
The uranium, killing my fellow
agents, that hobo I set on fire

19:49.739 --> 19:53.209
after I paid him to get his teeth
drilled to match my dental records?

19:53.277 --> 19:54.677
Jesus, the dentist?

19:54.744 --> 19:57.046
God damn, dude.

19:57.114 --> 19:57.914
I know.

19:57.981 --> 20:01.383
But I only did it because I wanted
us to be together, forever.

20:01.451 --> 20:01.851
Called it.

20:01.919 --> 20:03.853
I've loved you since the day we met.

20:03.921 --> 20:09.158
So mostly I'm sorry for... remember
that training mission in the D.R.?

20:09.226 --> 20:12.895
Uh... yeah, tap-and-trace
on the Cuban embassy.

20:12.963 --> 20:15.031
Then we got shit-housed on mamajuana.

20:15.098 --> 20:18.234
And then you passed out in your room.

20:18.302 --> 20:20.536
Um... yeah...

20:20.603 --> 20:22.238
Well, after you

20:22.306 --> 20:23.572
passed out, I --

20:23.640 --> 20:24.373
Luke?

20:24.441 --> 20:25.574
If you really do love me?

20:25.642 --> 20:26.575
You know I do.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.845
Then please don't finish that sentence.

20:28.912 --> 20:29.445
Dude.

20:29.512 --> 20:30.633
It's my deathbed confession.

20:30.680 --> 20:31.723
C'mon, I'm dying.

20:31.754 --> 20:35.156
Well I'm not, so please, don't --
After you passed out.

20:35.224 --> 20:38.059
I snuck into your room with a
big bottle of suntan oil, put

20:38.127 --> 20:44.766
- on some Al Green, and...
- Noooooooooooooooooooooo!

20:57.644 --> 20:59.549
Can we have the radio?

21:00.667 --> 21:08.667
