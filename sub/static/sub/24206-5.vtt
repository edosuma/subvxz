00:15.807 --> 00:18.476
Just gonna get this
picnic basket loaded on!

00:18.560 --> 00:20.645
Last item going on!

00:20.729 --> 00:23.148
Gonna spend the day by myself,

00:23.565 --> 00:25.942
-just me and my kitties!
-[cats meowing]

00:28.611 --> 00:30.780
Hmm, yeah!

00:31.156 --> 00:32.866
Just me by myself!

00:33.450 --> 00:36.119
Nothing important happened
on this day in history,

00:36.202 --> 00:37.620
that's for sure.

00:38.246 --> 00:41.583
Don't need anybody.
I can have fun, just me and you guys.

00:41.666 --> 00:44.586
We're gonna have a good day,
aren't we, Burton Cummings?

00:45.503 --> 00:47.630
You be good, Conway Kitty.

00:49.048 --> 00:50.675
Yeah, okay!

00:50.759 --> 00:53.845
The fun train is pulling out
of the station!

00:54.429 --> 00:56.389
Last chance to climb aboard!

00:56.473 --> 00:59.100
[man] Would you shut the fuck up?
I'm trying to sleep!

00:59.184 --> 01:01.102
Yeah, okay. That's it, then.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.146
I'm leaving!

01:03.229 --> 01:04.522
Here I go!

01:05.315 --> 01:08.651
Leaving this area
where we all live together,

01:08.902 --> 01:10.570
as best friends...

01:11.237 --> 01:13.073
to be by myself.

01:14.157 --> 01:16.701
Nothing special about today,
that's for sure.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.995
-[man] Shut the fuck up!
-[Bubbles whimpers]

01:19.079 --> 01:21.539
[theme music]

02:03.414 --> 02:05.291
Glen, get the fuck over here.

02:07.710 --> 02:09.211
See this right here?

02:09.294 --> 02:11.673
See this caulking?
It's decaying.

02:11.756 --> 02:14.134
At any time this window
could pop out and kill somebody.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.678
What's that got
to do with me, though?

02:16.761 --> 02:19.639
[scoffing] What... what if a family
were to come in here, okay?

02:19.722 --> 02:22.100
Walk by here with their kids,
and all of a sudden, boom!

02:22.183 --> 02:24.060
The window pops out
and kills everybody, huh?

02:24.144 --> 02:26.146
-[static]
-Good to go, bud, good to go.

02:26.229 --> 02:28.523
Huh? How would you feel about...
I can't fucking believe you, man.

02:28.606 --> 02:30.900
[Glen] I care if a family
gets killed but...

02:30.984 --> 02:32.902
-how is that my problem?
-How is that your problem?

02:32.986 --> 02:34.946
-I just work here.
-[Ricky on walkie] ...landed in the garden

02:35.029 --> 02:36.906
-[beep]
-Get the fuck over here. Come see this.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.867
Today is Bubbles' birthday,
so Ricky and I

02:38.950 --> 02:40.785
are trying to plan
something really cool for him.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.912
I mean, the past few years,
we've been in jail

02:42.996 --> 02:46.166
and last year we totally fucking
forgot about it, which was a nightmare.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.960
So today we have this surprise
party planned for him.

02:49.043 --> 02:52.088
You know, Trin and Sarah, they've been
gearing things up all morning.

02:52.171 --> 02:53.965
Now I just have to get him his gift.

02:54.048 --> 02:57.343
And this gift I'm giving him,
it's gonna blow his fucking mind.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.137
I can't wait till he gets it.

02:59.220 --> 03:01.806
All right, kids.
You guys ready to borrow this rocket

03:01.890 --> 03:03.725
-for Bubbles' birthday?
-[kids] Yeah!

03:03.808 --> 03:06.936
[child] Careful! Oh my God. Be careful.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.939
I mean, look at this shit. This is way
worse than the last fucking window.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.233
I cannot believe nobody's been
fucking killed yet in here.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.943
This isn't even my store, though.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.321
-I'm just confused now.
-Confused about what?

03:16.863 --> 03:19.198
I don't know. I just don't see
where you're coming from, dude.

03:19.282 --> 03:20.992
-Do you know why?
-Why?

03:21.075 --> 03:23.077
Because you're fucking dumb, Glen.
That's why.

03:23.161 --> 03:25.246
Shouldn't you be talking to Bobby
anyways? This is just fucked.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.916
Hey, hey, hey! You do not walk away
from a security officer.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.876
Right here!
Get back here!

03:29.959 --> 03:31.377
Hey, Julian.

03:31.461 --> 03:32.795
Gary, hey, buddy...

03:33.004 --> 03:34.881
You weren't supposed
to be back until next week.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.716
Yeah, I know.
The guy giving the course,

03:36.799 --> 03:38.760
he had... he had a heart attack,
the lucky bastard.

03:38.843 --> 03:40.470
So they... they cut it short.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.305
-What's going on here?
-[static]

03:42.388 --> 03:45.016
The pigeons have the cucumber.
I repeat, the pigeons have the cucumber.

03:45.099 --> 03:46.976
-We're making our way out of the store.
-[beep]

03:47.060 --> 03:48.978
Who was that? Was that Ricky?

03:49.062 --> 03:51.522
Yeah, he... he just bought a walkie.
He figured out the frequencies

03:51.606 --> 03:54.067
and he's just been fucking around
with me, but I'm on it.

03:54.150 --> 03:56.861
Ricky, Gary, my boss,
he's back unexpectedly here.

03:56.945 --> 03:59.197
-[Ricky] Back, back.
-How am I supposed to do a good job

03:59.280 --> 04:01.032
when you keep coming in
and driving me crazy?

04:01.115 --> 04:03.451
You know how serious I am
about this job, Ricky. Come on.

04:03.534 --> 04:06.079
Can you please stop fucking
around, embarrassing me?

04:06.162 --> 04:07.121
[beep]

04:07.205 --> 04:09.582
So you want the pigeons
to put the cucumber back on the shelf?

04:09.666 --> 04:11.626
-Or what the fuck do you want here?
-[beep]

04:11.709 --> 04:13.795
I don't know what you're talking about,
pigeons and cucumbers,

04:13.878 --> 04:15.672
but yeah, okay, I'll play along with you.

04:15.755 --> 04:19.175
Put it back and fly the pigeons
the fuck out of here, okay? Okay!

04:19.259 --> 04:20.385
[beep]

04:20.468 --> 04:22.470
Back on the shelf,
put it back on the shelf.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.515
Now what the fuck
are we supposed to do, Julian, huh?

04:25.598 --> 04:27.475
Fuck's sakes! All right.
You know what?

04:27.558 --> 04:29.769
You tell Gary he can
polish the shaft

04:29.852 --> 04:31.896
and the tip of my cock
with his fucking tongue.

04:31.980 --> 04:35.108
-[beep]
-Ricky, you stay off of our frequencies!

04:35.191 --> 04:36.734
They're restricted.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.778
And you better not be
in this mall, Ricky,

04:38.861 --> 04:40.738
because you're banned
and you know it!

04:40.822 --> 04:43.324
-[feedback]
-[Ricky] Hey, Gary, turn the fuck around.

04:43.408 --> 04:44.450
[beep]

04:45.743 --> 04:48.162
[Gary] Out! Or I'm calling the cops!

04:48.246 --> 04:49.956
Take it, Gary, right down to the base.

04:50.039 --> 04:51.624
-You take... You know you want it!
-Really?

04:51.708 --> 04:53.418
-It won't happen again, I promise.
-Really?

04:53.501 --> 04:55.837
I know, okay. I'm just...
I've got to make my rounds.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.505
Okay? I'll talk to you in a bit.

04:59.048 --> 04:59.882
[thud]

05:00.925 --> 05:04.178
I don't care if it is your money, bud.
We're not hiring him.

05:04.679 --> 05:06.723
He was the dumbest cop on the force.

05:07.098 --> 05:09.851
And not only that, he's dirty.

05:10.184 --> 05:11.853
You know, I might have been a drunk

05:12.395 --> 05:13.855
but I was never dirty.

05:13.938 --> 05:16.733
But he's the only one
that responded to the ad, Mr. Lahey.

05:16.816 --> 05:19.152
-I think we should give him a chance.
-No way!

05:19.527 --> 05:21.946
He's a goddamn loser, Randy!

05:22.780 --> 05:24.741
Look, guys...

05:25.533 --> 05:27.243
I'm desperate here, I've got nothing.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.454
I've been living in Ray's old place
down at the dump.

05:29.537 --> 05:32.373
Yeah, well, you can rot down there
as far as I'm fucking concerned, George.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.875
Mr. Lahey, have some compassion.

05:33.958 --> 05:37.211
When has this piece of shit ever shown me
any compassion, Randy?

05:37.295 --> 05:39.922
He's the guy who got me
kicked off the fucking force.

05:42.133 --> 05:44.844
[sighing] Please, Jim.

05:44.927 --> 05:46.095
What?

05:46.179 --> 05:47.764
I could really use the money.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.766
Yeah, well, couldn't we all?

05:50.058 --> 05:54.771
Look, the ad said "experienced".

05:55.396 --> 05:57.565
You're not fucking experienced, George!

05:58.149 --> 05:59.776
I was a cop.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.694
I think I can handle it.

06:01.778 --> 06:04.530
Yeah. You were
a goddamn shitty cop, George,

06:04.614 --> 06:06.282
and you couldn't handle it

06:06.365 --> 06:08.701
and that's why you're
standing right here.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.203
It's fate, George.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.330
It's the karmic wheel of shit,

06:12.413 --> 06:14.207
flinging shit balls all over.

06:14.290 --> 06:15.708
You know, it's like the fucking...

06:15.792 --> 06:18.628
all of those little fucking shit magnets
in your head, George,

06:18.711 --> 06:20.922
are fucking around because
they're caught in the shit wheel

06:21.005 --> 06:24.467
and fucking flinging those little shit
axioms in your dendrites

06:24.550 --> 06:26.302
and they're fucked over.
That's all it is.

06:26.385 --> 06:27.804
-Mr. Lahey.
-What?!

06:28.012 --> 06:31.015
If you do this for me,
I'll do that special thing you like.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.226
Oh...

06:34.310 --> 06:35.353
Oh.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.814
Okay, well then...

06:38.773 --> 06:40.024
Okay, George,

06:40.191 --> 06:41.609
I'll tell you what,

06:42.902 --> 06:46.239
100 bucks a week
and you can live in the shed out back.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.159
I'll take it.

06:51.577 --> 06:52.829
Good.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.413
Uh, Randy, uh...

06:54.622 --> 06:56.749
grab the pepper grinder and, uh...

06:56.833 --> 06:58.417
and some dish soap, uh...

06:58.918 --> 07:00.253
See you, George.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.557
There, see.
This isn't so bad.

07:12.640 --> 07:15.643
We're gonna have a great day
at the park, just like I promised.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.854
Look at all the people here,

07:18.604 --> 07:20.606
having fun with their friends.

07:21.315 --> 07:22.859
That's what I'm doing too.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.027
Having fun with my friends.
You guys have a snack.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.530
-Oh, look. Look at this.
-[meow]

07:27.613 --> 07:31.075
I brought your favourite catnips,
all four of them.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.744
I got the bubble maker here.
You guys can play with this.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.872
-[fan whirring]
-[laughs]

07:36.372 --> 07:38.082
Yeah, this is pretty good.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.626
I don't need anybody but you guys.

07:41.043 --> 07:43.463
And we're gonna have the perfect day.
Let's get at it.

07:44.881 --> 07:47.550
-[sniff]
-Oh, for fuck's sakes, guys!

07:48.968 --> 07:50.887
Who pissed on the sandwiches?

07:51.471 --> 07:53.097
[meowing]

07:53.723 --> 07:54.891
[click]

07:56.684 --> 07:59.103
Fuck's sakes, the whole basket!

08:00.438 --> 08:01.731
[sigh]

08:01.814 --> 08:04.775
This is everything we had on us
and everything Sarah had on her.

08:04.859 --> 08:08.613
-This is like 60 bucks between yous.
-Well, Sarah had 58 of it, Jacob had 2.

08:08.696 --> 08:11.866
-I had nothing, dude, but I helped.
-All right, here you go.

08:12.366 --> 08:14.243
Sorry, Julian. You don't have enough.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.538
I'm aware of that, Glen.
It's 3 bucks, that's every cent I have.

08:17.622 --> 08:20.625
I'm sorry but, if my cash comes up short,
it comes out of my pocket.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.461
It's, like, 3 fucking dollars.
I'll get you back.

08:23.544 --> 08:26.255
So you want me to loan you 3 bucks?
When do you get paid?

08:26.339 --> 08:27.715
In a couple of weeks.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.051
[laughing] Oh, my fuck.

08:30.134 --> 08:33.054
Okay, I'll go get a fucking advance
for 3 dollars!

08:33.136 --> 08:34.429
I'll tell you what.

08:34.514 --> 08:38.518
I'll loan you 3 bucks, but you have
to pay me 20 by the end of the day.

08:38.851 --> 08:41.562
-20 bucks?
-And if not, 40 tomorrow.

08:41.645 --> 08:43.231
You greasy motherfucker.

08:43.313 --> 08:45.525
-20 bucks interest a day?
-Hmm.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.735
Okay, fine, ring it in.

08:48.569 --> 08:49.946
And I want your drink.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.406
[laughing]
You want my fucking drink, do you?

08:52.490 --> 08:54.158
Do you want the rocket?

08:55.409 --> 08:58.162
Get the fuck over here!
Open up your goddamn yap!

08:58.246 --> 09:00.957
-Here, here's your fucking drink!
-[gurgling, exhaling]

09:01.040 --> 09:03.417
All right, you guys head back
and get that set up, okay?

09:03.501 --> 09:05.211
Get someone else to read
the instructions though

09:05.294 --> 09:06.879
because you're too stupid
to put this together.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.090
Cool. We've got this. We should take
these too. They're dope.

09:09.173 --> 09:12.176
Put those fucking things back!
Boys, if you fuck this up,

09:12.260 --> 09:14.595
I'm gonna strap you
to the goddamn thing and launch it.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.430
-You got it?
-[Cory] Yeah, dude. I got it.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.683
-Now get out.
-Both of us won't fit on it anyway.

09:18.766 --> 09:20.560
Just set the fucking thing up.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.979
-Don't forget your receipt.
-Oh, go fuck yourself, Glen!

09:23.062 --> 09:25.314
-Thanks for shopping at Bobby's Hobbies!
-Fuck off.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.400
[chatter on walkie]

09:27.650 --> 09:29.610
-[knocking]
-Hey, Gare, how's it going, buddy?

09:29.694 --> 09:32.697
Look man, something's come up.
I need an advance on my paycheck, so...

09:32.780 --> 09:34.240
-[laughing]
-...how do we make that happen?

09:34.407 --> 09:35.908
An advance on your paycheck!
That's really funny.

09:35.992 --> 09:37.368
-What?
-Like, that's Carrot Top funny,

09:37.451 --> 09:39.829
because, actually, you know,
we don't make that happen at all.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.747
But here's what
we can make happen.

09:41.831 --> 09:44.166
How about you getting arrested, Julian?
How does that sound?

09:44.250 --> 09:46.043
What the fuck are you talking about?

09:46.127 --> 09:47.837
Well, what would you say
if I told you

09:47.920 --> 09:50.423
that we have you on tape, stealing?
Multiple counts.

09:50.506 --> 09:52.758
I'd say you're full of shit,
considering someone broke in,

09:52.842 --> 09:55.011
stole all the fucking surveillance tapes
for the past two weeks.

09:55.094 --> 09:58.180
That's true. But what that person,
that someone didn't know,

09:58.264 --> 10:00.433
is that we have a backup system.

10:00.891 --> 10:02.310
Oh, my fuck...

10:02.935 --> 10:03.936
[sighing]

10:04.020 --> 10:05.229
So what now?

10:05.313 --> 10:06.856
I don't know, honestly, Julian,

10:06.939 --> 10:09.609
because I frankly
don't fucking care.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.569
-Fuck the mall!
-[clattering]

10:11.652 --> 10:13.321
Fuck security!

10:13.404 --> 10:14.905
Fuck the ashram!

10:14.989 --> 10:16.824
And, while we're at it, Julian...

10:17.742 --> 10:19.201
-[pounding table]
-...fuck you!

10:19.410 --> 10:21.162
So this is how we can handle this.

10:21.245 --> 10:24.165
I can call the cops and bring them
in here to take care of things,

10:24.248 --> 10:29.045
or you can come to me by the end
of the day, with 1,000 bucks, cash.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.172
Your choice.

10:31.255 --> 10:33.799
[woman on walkie] Gary, someone shit
on the floor in the food court.

10:33.883 --> 10:34.967
[Gary] Mmm.

10:35.926 --> 10:37.428
-Gary?
-Mmm.

10:38.262 --> 10:40.264
Yup, fun train's back!

10:40.681 --> 10:42.600
The fun train is back!

10:43.225 --> 10:46.062
Had the fucking best time ever!

10:47.104 --> 10:49.065
Best time ever, yeah, okay.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.983
Nobody gives a fuck, eh?

10:51.067 --> 10:52.860
Okay, well, guess what?

10:52.943 --> 10:55.071
I don't give a fuck
anymore either.

10:55.279 --> 10:56.656
You know what, guys?

10:57.073 --> 10:59.158
We don't need this bullshit.

10:59.241 --> 11:00.951
Let's get packed up.

11:01.035 --> 11:02.953
We don't fucking need anything.

11:03.037 --> 11:04.955
Move this whole operation
down to the ocean.

11:05.039 --> 11:07.583
All I need is you guys.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.710
Take some fucking clothes...

11:09.794 --> 11:11.587
some clothes and maybe...

11:12.004 --> 11:15.091
one kitty toy... and...

11:15.466 --> 11:17.385
Red Sovine tape, kitty book...

11:17.468 --> 11:18.594
[bassy music playing on car stereo]

11:18.677 --> 11:20.930
...and my Wayne Gretzky card
signed by Dave Semenko.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.765
That's all I fucking need!

11:22.848 --> 11:24.225
[Tyrone] Yo, Bubs!

11:25.559 --> 11:27.228
Yo, happy birthday, motherfucker!

11:27.311 --> 11:28.687
Hey, T!

11:29.188 --> 11:30.689
What's going on?

11:31.190 --> 11:32.775
What's that?

11:32.858 --> 11:34.527
Holy fuck!

11:34.944 --> 11:36.445
Decent!

11:37.196 --> 11:39.407
Oh my fuck, that is decent!

11:39.490 --> 11:41.575
I can't believe
you remembered my birthday.

11:41.742 --> 11:43.702
-Thanks!
-Nah, I didn't remember shit, man,

11:43.786 --> 11:45.621
I've been getting stoned
as fuck lately, man.

11:45.704 --> 11:47.373
But that's from Ricky and Julian.

11:47.748 --> 11:49.375
What? What are you talking about?

11:49.458 --> 11:51.794
Look, all I know is
I'm supposed to drive you.

11:51.877 --> 11:54.505
So come on wit' yo candy.
And put this over your lookballs.

11:54.588 --> 11:56.257
This is to cover
your lookballs up.

11:56.340 --> 11:57.550
What? That's my...

11:58.008 --> 12:00.469
-that's my kitty sleep mask.
-Yeah, man.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.347
-Like that?
-Make sure you can't see behind there.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.724
Surprise, surprise.

12:06.183 --> 12:08.102
-[Tyrone] Let's roll.
-[excited grunt]

12:08.185 --> 12:11.355
Oh, boys! Gettin' excited!
[chuckling]

12:11.730 --> 12:13.774
-You ready Bubbles, man?
-Oh, I'm ready!

12:13.858 --> 12:16.152
-I'm ready! Are we there?
-Man, you're gonna like this, man.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.279
-We almost there?
-We're almost here, my man.

12:18.362 --> 12:21.240
-[Bubbles laughing] Oh, I'm excited!
-Be excited. Let's go.

12:21.323 --> 12:22.950
-Oh, I am excited!
-Jump out, dawg!

12:23.033 --> 12:25.494
It's so weird not being
able to see anything.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.204
I can't see anything.

12:27.288 --> 12:29.165
Ooh! Oh, somebody's got me!

12:29.540 --> 12:31.083
Who else is here?

12:31.167 --> 12:32.501
Who else is here?

12:32.585 --> 12:33.878
Somebody's got a hold of me.

12:33.961 --> 12:36.172
[Ricky, low-pitched voice]
Uh, I don't know who it is.

12:36.255 --> 12:38.174
[Bubbles giggling]
Who's that?

12:38.549 --> 12:41.260
Okay, just wait now.
[grunt]

12:41.343 --> 12:43.971
-[Tyrone] Y'all ready man, or what?
-I'm ready! I'm ready!

12:44.763 --> 12:46.974
[crowd] Happy birthday, Bubbles!

12:47.057 --> 12:49.226
-Holy fuck!
-[cheering]

12:49.310 --> 12:51.353
-Oh, my God!
-[laughter]

12:51.437 --> 12:54.106
I've never had
a surprise party before!

12:54.190 --> 12:56.484
I thought everybody
forgot what today was!

12:56.567 --> 12:58.944
No, man. What are you, joking?
We never forget this shit!

12:59.028 --> 13:00.738
-[Bubbles giggling]
-I mean, we did forget last year

13:00.821 --> 13:02.781
but just because of a lot
of fucking crazy drugs.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.492
Nobody's ever gonna
forget it again, Bubbles.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.202
-Oh, decent!
-Happy birthday!

13:06.285 --> 13:07.328
-Oh!
-[Ricky] Yeah!

13:07.411 --> 13:08.621
-Thank you.
-You look adorable.

13:08.704 --> 13:09.997
Thank you, Sarah. Thank you.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.749
Everybody's here!

13:11.832 --> 13:13.792
Everybody's here.
Where's Julian though?

13:14.043 --> 13:15.628
Well, that's the problem.
We're not sure.

13:15.711 --> 13:17.421
He was supposed
to be here long ago.

13:17.963 --> 13:20.299
-I hope to fuck he's not dead.
-Dead? What?

13:20.382 --> 13:21.717
What are you...
What was he doing?

13:21.800 --> 13:23.552
That's the thing.
He wasn't doing anything.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.263
It's just weird that he's not here
by now. And he's late, because...

13:26.347 --> 13:28.182
He organized this whole
fucking thing for you.

13:28.265 --> 13:30.142
-He could've got killed, Bubs.
-[Bubbles sighing]

13:30.226 --> 13:32.353
Yeah, but, Ricky, why does
your brain even go there? What...

13:32.436 --> 13:34.355
I'm sure he's just running late, okay?

13:34.438 --> 13:36.815
-Oh!
-Should we wait for him or...?

13:37.483 --> 13:39.443
Well, yeah, we should wait for him.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.445
No, fuck it.

13:41.904 --> 13:44.031
-What do you mean?
-Check this the fuck out!

13:45.074 --> 13:48.035
-[laughter, cheers]
-Holy fuck!

13:48.661 --> 13:51.664
Holy fuck! LOC Patriot!

13:51.747 --> 13:54.416
-Eight foot four inches!
-[crowd chanting] Bubbles! Bubbles!

13:54.500 --> 13:56.168
Holy fuck! And motor!

13:56.252 --> 13:58.712
8,000 feet at apogee!
[panting]

13:58.796 --> 14:00.214
You okay, buddy?

14:00.464 --> 14:02.675
You're not gonna have one of these
strokey things, are you?

14:02.758 --> 14:04.009
No, Ricky.

14:04.343 --> 14:06.762
That's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen!

14:07.388 --> 14:09.807
-Is this mine?
-[Ricky] It's yours, buddy.

14:09.890 --> 14:11.392
-[happy grunt]
-[laughter]

14:12.059 --> 14:14.979
[Mr. Lahey] Randy, you've gotta bet big
if you wanna win big.

14:15.062 --> 14:17.356
-When are you gonna--
-All right, Lahey! Money, now!

14:17.439 --> 14:19.149
Half the month's wages,
that's the deal,

14:19.233 --> 14:21.443
and I'm taking an advance
on next month's wages too!

14:21.527 --> 14:23.279
Julian, you can't just
come barging in here!

14:23.362 --> 14:25.114
Oh, yes, I can, Randy.

14:25.197 --> 14:27.199
As long as you two fuckheads
owe me money,

14:27.283 --> 14:28.993
I'm gonna do
whatever the fuck I want!

14:29.076 --> 14:31.203
Julian, just calm down, buddy.
Let's talk about this.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.789
Oh, let's talk... What do you mean
let's talk about it? Huh?

14:33.873 --> 14:36.458
One thousand dollars!
I'm not leaving without it!

14:36.542 --> 14:38.377
Julian, this isn't the right way
to go about...

14:38.460 --> 14:40.713
-Get your fucking hands off me!
-[George] Hey!

14:41.505 --> 14:44.550
Step the fuck away
from Randy, Julian, now.

14:45.301 --> 14:48.304
-What the fuck are you doing?
-I'm working for them now.

14:48.387 --> 14:52.099
And I'm giving you exactly three seconds
to walk the fuck out of here.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.019
Oh, what are you gonna do?
Shoot me?

14:55.102 --> 14:56.729
-Huh?
-[gun clicking]

14:58.355 --> 15:00.900
You wanna try me, Julian? Do you?

15:01.108 --> 15:04.153
'Cause I've got absolutely nothing
to fucking lose here!

15:04.236 --> 15:06.322
Absolutely fucking nothing!

15:06.488 --> 15:08.115
So go ahead, Julian!

15:08.782 --> 15:11.160
Make my fucking day better.

15:12.494 --> 15:14.038
Fuck off.

15:14.121 --> 15:17.374
It's "make my day,"
not "make my day better," fuckhead.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.919
This isn't over,
I want my fucking money!

15:20.169 --> 15:21.670
Get the fuck out of here.

15:24.632 --> 15:27.217
[Mr. Lahey mumbles indistinctly]

15:27.301 --> 15:30.179
That was really, really fucking
impressive, George.

15:30.262 --> 15:31.931
I should've fucking shot him.

15:32.014 --> 15:33.807
We don't want anyone
to get shot here.

15:33.891 --> 15:35.684
Holy frig, you gotta calm down, George.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.811
Yeah. And you need
to go on a diet, Randy,

15:37.895 --> 15:40.314
but it doesn't seem like
that's gonna happen, does it?

15:41.357 --> 15:42.775
[chuckle]

15:43.275 --> 15:45.235
Looks like my job description
just got a little broader,

15:45.319 --> 15:47.571
-wouldn't you say, Jim?
-What do you mean, George?

15:47.947 --> 15:51.075
He said he's coming back.
I'm gonna have to deal with it.

15:51.158 --> 15:53.744
-Yeah, well, Randy--
-[George screaming] I'm... going...

15:53.827 --> 15:55.579
to deal with it.

15:55.996 --> 15:57.581
What do you want, George?

15:57.873 --> 16:00.376
Hah, it's 250 a week,
like the ad said.

16:00.584 --> 16:02.962
And I want a real fucking bed
to sleep on out there.

16:09.051 --> 16:13.389
And that's what happens
when you hire a shit weasel, Randy.

16:14.848 --> 16:16.600
We've got an air mattress.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.644
Oh, fuck...

16:18.727 --> 16:20.771
-Brrrap!
-Yo, Julian!

16:20.854 --> 16:22.272
What's up, your boy!

16:22.356 --> 16:23.816
Yes, Julian!

16:24.233 --> 16:25.776
Happy birthday, buddy.
Sorry I'm late, man.

16:25.859 --> 16:27.611
But what do you think
of that fucking thing?

16:27.695 --> 16:30.531
-[Bubbles] Ho-ly fuck!
-Yeah? Did we do good or what, man?

16:30.614 --> 16:32.741
You did fucking amazing!
Thank you, Julian!

16:32.825 --> 16:35.285
Yeah, well, okay.
Enough with the mushy kiss-kiss.

16:35.369 --> 16:37.663
Come on, let's get this fucking sucker
launched already!

16:37.746 --> 16:40.457
-[crowd cheering]
-Let's launch her!

16:40.541 --> 16:42.292
-Okay, boys, okay.
-[clicking]

16:42.376 --> 16:44.878
She's f... Ricky!
Ricky, what are you doing?

16:44.962 --> 16:46.922
Just making sure it works,
the button does push.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.882
You don't push the fucking l...

16:48.966 --> 16:50.509
And, guys, back the fuck off!

16:50.592 --> 16:52.219
This is not a toy!

16:52.636 --> 16:55.347
That was unsafe, what we just did.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.558
Okay, everybody, listen.

16:57.641 --> 17:01.395
Okay? I know you're all tired,
you've waited a long time but I...

17:01.478 --> 17:03.272
I want to dedicate this launch.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.941
I'm gonna dedicate it
to each and every one of you guys,

17:06.025 --> 17:08.318
the residents
of the Sunnyvale Trailer Park.

17:08.402 --> 17:09.778
-Nice.
-You're all my friends

17:09.862 --> 17:11.571
and you're all my family,
every one of yous.

17:11.655 --> 17:13.866
-[crowd cheering]
-Okay, so,

17:13.949 --> 17:16.452
are you ready to get this fucking thing
in the air or what?

17:16.535 --> 17:18.162
-[crowd cheering]
-[Ricky] Let's do it!

17:18.244 --> 17:21.415
Okay, let's... just show you
what you do here.

17:21.498 --> 17:23.083
-See this?
-That's a key.

17:23.166 --> 17:25.461
-This goes in here.
-[click]

17:25.544 --> 17:27.588
Okay. You hear that?

17:27.671 --> 17:30.591
That means she is lit, ready to go!

17:30.674 --> 17:33.052
Here we go!
I want a big Sunnyvale countdown.

17:33.135 --> 17:34.845
In 5...

17:34.928 --> 17:38.390
[crowd joins in] 4, 3, 2, 1...

17:38.474 --> 17:40.684
-Launch!
-[man] What the fuck?

17:41.894 --> 17:44.104
-[Bubbles] For fuck's sakes!
-[Ricky] What the fuck?

17:44.188 --> 17:46.899
-Hang on. Just wait.
-Lame!

17:47.066 --> 17:48.901
Well, just give me a minute now.

17:48.984 --> 17:51.403
Bubbles, I know it would be splendid
but, listen,

17:51.487 --> 17:53.280
we'll watch it at another time.

17:53.781 --> 17:56.408
You're leaving?
Oh, just... Look, it'll take me...

17:56.492 --> 17:58.327
I can put a new igniter in it.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.412
Bubs, I'm sorry,
we have to leave too.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.247
Mo's getting really tired.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.083
-Oh...
-High five?

18:04.458 --> 18:07.503
Look, Trin, it'll take me...
Boys, you guys are staying?

18:07.586 --> 18:09.713
Man, we got pitchers
waiting at the T-box.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.507
-Sorry, man, we out.
-Yeah, we out.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.717
For fuck's sake, look.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.219
[Sarah] Yeah, happy birthday.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.013
I can put a new igniter in it.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.307
Fuck, buddy. You really fucked
this up, didn't you?

18:20.390 --> 18:22.017
-What happened?
-I don't know, Ricky.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.645
It should be...
it should be going.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.731
Well, don't worry about it. It's not
your fault you let everybody down.

18:28.690 --> 18:31.235
When are you starting your job
at Hallmark, Ricky?

18:31.318 --> 18:33.654
-Where?
-Bubs, don't worry about it, okay?

18:33.737 --> 18:36.240
Don't let this ruin your birthday.
We'll figure it out, man.

18:36.323 --> 18:37.950
Ruin my birthday?

18:38.033 --> 18:39.493
Yeah. We'll figure it out.

18:39.576 --> 18:41.328
Are you joking? Julian...

18:41.578 --> 18:44.498
It wouldn't matter if the rocket
exploded on the launch pad

18:44.581 --> 18:47.167
and fucking lit my balls on fire.

18:48.293 --> 18:51.463
You know, the fact that you guys
remembered my birthday

18:51.880 --> 18:53.465
and you went through
all of this trouble

18:53.549 --> 18:55.884
-to make it a special day for me...
-Fucking right we did.

18:55.968 --> 18:59.555
That's way more important to me
than any fucking rocket could ever be,

18:59.638 --> 19:01.306
I just want you to know that.

19:01.390 --> 19:03.517
-I love you guys. Get in here.
-Love you too, buddy.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.644
I love you. There's nothing
that could ruin this.

19:05.727 --> 19:07.312
-There's no...
-[rocket hissing]

19:07.396 --> 19:09.648
[whooshing]

19:09.731 --> 19:11.358
Holy fuck!

19:12.442 --> 19:13.777
She went!

19:14.278 --> 19:15.988
Where is it, boys?
I lost it.

19:18.031 --> 19:20.492
-Where is it?
-I don't know, maybe it blowed up,

19:20.576 --> 19:22.035
look at the fucking
black smoke over there.

19:22.786 --> 19:24.413
[Bubbles] Holy fuck!

19:24.496 --> 19:26.081
No, that wouldn't be...

19:26.165 --> 19:27.749
That wouldn't be
from that rocket.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.626
You'd never get that
much smoke, would you?

19:29.710 --> 19:31.420
We should get out of here
just in case.

19:31.503 --> 19:33.213
Let's get the fuck
out of here. Let's go.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.007
Okay, we've got
to go find it, boys.

19:35.090 --> 19:36.758
We're never gonna find
that fucking thing!

19:36.842 --> 19:40.387
We can find it! We can find it!
We're on a recovery mission!

19:40.637 --> 19:42.222
Let's go!

19:45.058 --> 19:47.853
I am fucking craving
donairs and fucking...

19:47.936 --> 19:49.771
some poutine.
You guys hungry?

19:49.855 --> 19:53.108
Ricky, we have to find my fucking rocket
before someone else does.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.902
Boys, I hope that didn't get
too fucked up.

19:54.985 --> 19:57.946
I think we should think about writing
that thing off at this point, Bubs.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.573
We're not writing it off!

19:59.656 --> 20:01.950
It's probably not that
fucked up and, I mean,

20:02.034 --> 20:03.952
that's my prized
possession, boys.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.954
-What the fuck?
-Oh, fuck, man! It's a roadblock!

20:06.038 --> 20:07.748
I've got a joint!
Whip it around! Fuck!

20:07.831 --> 20:10.125
[Julian] How am I gonna whip
this fucking thing around, huh?

20:10.209 --> 20:12.336
[Bubbles] Well, slow down...
Ricky, throw it out the fucking window.

20:12.419 --> 20:14.338
We're good, we're good.
I got this. Is that Ted?

20:14.421 --> 20:16.089
Oh, this is a fucking joke.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.549
[Bubbles] Ricky,
just throw the fucking...

20:17.633 --> 20:18.967
[Ricky] We're good, boys, we're good.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.844
-[Bubbles whimpers anxiously]
-[brakes squeaking]

20:23.513 --> 20:25.974
-Whew, it smells like skunk in here.
[Ricky] It's probably your balls, Ted.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.643
When was the last time you showered?

20:27.726 --> 20:29.645
Where are you boys
coming from, anyway?

20:29.728 --> 20:32.231
We're actually just down at the
Fuck Off convention at the Legion there.

20:32.314 --> 20:34.107
Wondering if you'd come down
to master the ceremonies.

20:34.191 --> 20:35.984
-Yeah, yeah, very funny, Ricky.
-It's Bubbles' birthday.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.694
We were playing space.
Like, what's going on here?

20:37.778 --> 20:39.363
Can we get through
there or what?

20:39.446 --> 20:41.073
No. Not right now.
There's been an attack.

20:41.156 --> 20:43.325
-It's possibly terrorists.
-[Ricky] What?

20:43.408 --> 20:45.786
[Bubbles] What? Terrorists?
What do you mean?

20:45.869 --> 20:48.705
Well, somebody shot down Steve Rogers'
news helicopter with a missile.

20:48.789 --> 20:52.793
What the fuck? What the fuck is wrong
with people? Are you serious?

20:52.876 --> 20:54.670
[Bubbles] A missile?
What kind of a missile?

20:54.753 --> 20:56.797
[Ted] We're not sure yet
but we've got three witnesses

20:56.880 --> 20:58.590
say they saw a missile
coming from the east

20:58.674 --> 21:01.093
and it took out the chopper.
That's all we know for now.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.971
[Bubbles] Oh, my fuck, boys.
Is Steve okay?

21:04.054 --> 21:06.807
Well, the rescue crew is not
on the crash site yet

21:06.890 --> 21:10.269
but from what we can see from above,
it doesn't look good for survivors.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.021
-[Julian] Fuck.
-Oh, my God!

21:13.105 --> 21:15.148
[Ricky] That's fucking terrible.
Poor Steve.

21:15.232 --> 21:17.401
[Ted] Yeah, well, you guys cannot
stay here, you can...

21:17.484 --> 21:20.028
Well, you can stay here. I don't know
how long it's gonna be,

21:20.112 --> 21:21.405
but otherwise
you've got to turn around...

21:21.488 --> 21:22.906
Left something in the oven,
my iron's on.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.908
-So we're just gonna go back...
-Yeah, okay, Ricky.

21:24.992 --> 21:27.286
Well, you know, we know your record
for burning down your house.

21:28.912 --> 21:31.373
We know your record
for being a fucking idiot!

21:31.456 --> 21:33.208
[Bubbles whispering] Boys, boys...

21:33.292 --> 21:35.627
We shot down Steve Rogers' helicopter!

21:35.711 --> 21:37.546
[Ricky] It may not have been us.

21:37.629 --> 21:41.216
Ricky, how many people do you think
have fired fucking missiles off today?

21:41.717 --> 21:43.051
It was us.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.721
[Ricky] It would be a weird
fucking coincidence, wouldn't it?

21:47.931 --> 21:50.142
Bubs, you've got to stop
hogging my driveway, man.

21:50.225 --> 21:53.061
I'm... I get part of
the fucking driveway too.

21:53.145 --> 21:56.440
Do you think that's really the fucking
important thing at hand right now?

21:56.523 --> 21:58.942
What the fuck are these
two shit smears up to?

22:00.819 --> 22:02.446
[Cory] Yo, you guys hear
about what happened?

22:02.529 --> 22:04.740
No. What, did you start growing
a fucking brain or something?

22:04.823 --> 22:07.868
Yeah, you wish, dude. Terrorist attack.
We're going after them.

22:07.951 --> 22:10.078
It wasn't fucking terrorists,
you stupider than dumb idiots.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.663
-It was fucking Bub--
-Ricky, Rick, Rick! Yeah,

22:11.747 --> 22:13.665
we heard about it.
How did you guys hear about it?

22:13.749 --> 22:15.459
It was all over the news.
Everyone's freaking out.

22:15.542 --> 22:17.461
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!

22:17.544 --> 22:19.671
[Trinity] Thank God, you're okay!
Did you hear about what happened?

22:19.755 --> 22:21.882
Yeah. Is there any update
on Steve Rogers? Was he killed?

22:21.965 --> 22:23.675
I don't know.
That's what they're saying.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.010
Oh, poor Steve!

22:25.093 --> 22:26.678
I just wanna go.
Can we please leave?

22:26.762 --> 22:28.513
Where are we gonna go?
We can't go anywhere!

22:28.597 --> 22:31.933
Don't be a fucking wuss! We need to get
out of the park, to take Mo and leave!

22:32.017 --> 22:33.643
Okay... everybody just
calm the fuck down.

22:33.727 --> 22:35.562
-[Trinity] No, we're leaving.
-[Sarah] Guys!

22:35.979 --> 22:37.981
I think you better come and watch this.

22:38.315 --> 22:40.358
[news theme music]

22:43.528 --> 22:45.489
[reporter] Okay, we've got exclusive
video for you now.

22:45.572 --> 22:49.618
This is footage of the actual attack
from Steve Rogers' news camera.

22:49.701 --> 22:53.663
Just a warning: this is very graphic
and not appropriate for all viewers.

22:54.164 --> 22:57.626
Oh, my Jesus. Tell me we're not going
to see him fucking die right here.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.711
No one is sure exactly

22:59.795 --> 23:02.089
why the local squirrel
population has dwindled

23:02.172 --> 23:06.259
but it's this reporter's belief
that the answer could lie here

23:06.343 --> 23:08.845
deep in the heart of...
What the fuck is that?

23:08.929 --> 23:10.931
-[high-pitched whining]
-Shit!

23:12.599 --> 23:14.392
Steve Rogers, reporting live.

23:14.601 --> 23:16.520
-[alarm beeping]
-Unconfirmed reports that we've been

23:16.603 --> 23:18.480
struck by a missile, and we are...

23:18.563 --> 23:21.274
we are crashing.
We are on fire.

23:21.358 --> 23:23.819
We're going down.
We're losing altitude.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.029
Steve "No Nonsense" Rogers,

23:26.988 --> 23:29.616
reporting on what could be
his last story.

23:30.033 --> 23:31.660
Tell my wife I'm sorry!

23:32.285 --> 23:34.162
Oh, Jesus Murphy!

23:34.246 --> 23:36.248
Oh, my God,
we killed Steve Rogers!

23:36.331 --> 23:38.708
How can you kill them?
That wasn't your fucking--

23:38.792 --> 23:41.086
-Wait! Listen, listen, listen!
-Jacob, chips. Let's go.

23:41.169 --> 23:43.588
A harrowing moment earlier today...

23:43.672 --> 23:46.591
Oh, fuck, he's alive! Yes!

23:46.675 --> 23:49.636
...matings of the Nova Scotia squirrel

23:49.719 --> 23:51.221
turned nearly fatal

23:51.304 --> 23:52.806
in the blink of an eye.

23:53.223 --> 23:55.183
Steve "Nine Lives" Rogers...

23:55.267 --> 23:56.226
[bed whirring]

23:56.309 --> 23:57.686
...signing off.

23:57.769 --> 24:01.273
Yes! Steve Rogers is alive and well, baby!

24:02.399 --> 24:03.900
We got lucky, boys.

24:04.860 --> 24:06.987
[whispering] Julian, we still shot
the fucking thing down.

24:07.070 --> 24:09.990
What if they catch us and they try
to make us pay for that helicopter?

24:10.073 --> 24:11.867
-Bubs...
-[sirens blaring outside]

24:12.659 --> 24:14.661
Ah, yeah.
Yeah, here we go.

24:14.744 --> 24:17.330
-We're fucking caught already!
-The fuck is this all about?

24:17.414 --> 24:19.291
You know what? Fuck this!
I'm turning myself in.

24:19.374 --> 24:22.377
You're not turning yourself in!
Just fucking relax, Bubs!

24:22.460 --> 24:24.963
Boys, we're caught.
There's no fucking way out of this.

24:25.046 --> 24:27.382
Yes, there is. There's a fucking way
out of everything. Trust me.

24:27.465 --> 24:29.009
No, I'm turning myself in.

24:29.092 --> 24:30.802
-Bubbles, fuck off.
-You're not turning yourself in.

24:30.886 --> 24:32.804
-[Bubbles] I'm right here, officer!
-[Ricky] Shut the fuck up!

24:32.888 --> 24:35.307
-I'm not gonna resist!
-Shut the fuck up! I got this.

24:35.473 --> 24:37.225
Hey, boys, how's it going?

24:37.309 --> 24:38.852
The Shittiest Beard
Of All Times competition

24:38.935 --> 24:40.812
-is right down there, two doors.
-What?

24:40.896 --> 24:42.814
Nothing? What are you guys doing?
We're kind of tired.

24:42.898 --> 24:44.900
Been in Moncton the last few days.
What do you need?

24:45.358 --> 24:47.152
Hands behind your back, sir.
Up against the car, please.

24:47.235 --> 24:49.821
-What?
-What the fuck for?

24:49.905 --> 24:52.407
You're under arrest for shoplifting
and theft over a thousand dollars.

24:52.490 --> 24:54.159
[Julian chuckling]
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

24:54.242 --> 24:56.369
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will

24:56.453 --> 24:58.038
be used against you
in a court of law.

24:58.121 --> 24:59.414
I know the fucking drill, all right.

24:59.497 --> 25:02.250
There's some kind of misunderstanding
here. I didn't steal a goddamn thing.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.252
We have all the tapes from Gary,
the mall manager.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.171
Might as well save it
for the judge. Load him up.

25:06.379 --> 25:08.632
I can't fucking believe
you did this, Julian.

25:08.715 --> 25:10.050
-Bubs, I...
-Shoplifting!?

25:10.133 --> 25:11.843
Bubs, I didn't do anything wrong.

25:11.927 --> 25:14.346
Shoplifting at the fucking mall!

25:15.138 --> 25:17.349
[shaky voice]
I should have fucking known.

25:19.184 --> 25:20.810
[car doors closing]

25:20.894 --> 25:23.521
I'll look after your drink
for you, Julian. Good luck, bud!

25:25.023 --> 25:27.692
-[Bubbles whimpering]
-[cat meowing]

25:27.776 --> 25:29.778
Don't even worry about this, guys.

25:30.070 --> 25:31.863
We're gonna find a fucking...

25:31.947 --> 25:33.949
better place to live,
every one of us,

25:34.032 --> 25:36.076
we're gonna have the best time.

25:36.159 --> 25:37.327
[whimpering]

25:37.410 --> 25:39.454
[Ricky] Hey, can you guys
fuck off, seriously?

25:39.537 --> 25:40.872
Show some goddamn respect.

25:40.956 --> 25:43.458
Let the man have a little bit
of peace and quiet. Jesus!

25:43.541 --> 25:45.460
-Hey Bubs, are you in there, buddy?
-[pounding on door]

25:45.543 --> 25:47.879
-[cat screeching]
-[Bubbles yelling] Jesus, Ricky!

25:47.963 --> 25:50.590
[Ricky] Sorry, just seeing if you're home.
Wanna smoke a joint or something?

25:50.674 --> 25:52.384
[Bubbles sighing] No.

25:52.759 --> 25:54.678
[Ricky] What the fuck
are you doing packing that up?

25:54.761 --> 25:57.806
-Going on a trip somewhere?
-I'm thinking I might just...

25:57.889 --> 25:59.891
go live somewhere else, Ricky.

26:00.350 --> 26:02.185
Whoa... what the fuck
are you talking about?

26:03.853 --> 26:06.356
Look, Ricky,
I love you and Julian.

26:06.439 --> 26:08.191
You know that, but...

26:08.692 --> 26:11.111
I just don't think I can be
around you guys anymore.

26:11.194 --> 26:12.529
I don't think I can.

26:12.612 --> 26:14.322
Don't talk like that. That's crazy.

26:14.406 --> 26:17.409
It's not crazy, though, Ricky.
It's not crazy.

26:17.867 --> 26:20.036
Look, all I wanted was to just live,

26:20.120 --> 26:22.747
and not get fucking tangled up
in illegal bullshit,

26:22.831 --> 26:24.749
and I asked you guys
if we could do that,

26:24.833 --> 26:26.543
and you guys both
looked me in the eye

26:26.626 --> 26:29.587
and you promised me we could,
and what fucking happened?

26:30.213 --> 26:32.340
Actually, I don't really remember.
What happened?

26:32.424 --> 26:35.135
[Bubbles sighing]
Julian's running a full-on crime syndicate

26:35.218 --> 26:37.262
down at the fucking mall.
That's what happened!

26:37.345 --> 26:39.139
Well, I fucking didn't know
anything about that.

26:39.222 --> 26:41.933
Yeah, well, maybe you did
and maybe you didn't, Ricky.

26:42.017 --> 26:43.810
I don't even fucking know.

26:44.185 --> 26:47.439
But I do know this:
nothing's ever gonna fucking change.

26:47.814 --> 26:49.524
Nothing's ever gonna change, Ricky.

26:49.607 --> 26:53.320
I was so fucking happy today
that you guys remembered my birthday.

26:53.403 --> 26:54.446
I know, right?

26:54.529 --> 26:56.948
You threw that party
and you got me this awesome present.

26:57.032 --> 27:02.162
And it turns out, it was all just a big,
fucking Ricky and Julian lie.

27:02.245 --> 27:04.372
It wasn't a fucking lie, it happened!
I was there.

27:04.456 --> 27:07.167
It was a lie, Ricky,
because people always say,

27:07.250 --> 27:09.210
"It's the thought that counts."

27:09.294 --> 27:11.379
-Did you ever hear people say that?
-Yes, right, exactly.

27:11.463 --> 27:14.591
Yeah well, if somebody steals
your fucking birthday present, Ricky,

27:14.674 --> 27:17.052
[sobbing]
then how does that fucking count for...

27:17.135 --> 27:19.804
-But he didn't steal that.
-Oh, yeah...

27:19.888 --> 27:21.598
I don't even wanna hear it.

27:21.681 --> 27:23.475
Bubs, listen.
I swear to fuck, okay?

27:23.558 --> 27:25.852
Yes, Julian has been stealing
a bit of stuff here and there

27:25.935 --> 27:28.646
but he told me he paid for the rocket.
He showed me the fucking receipt

27:28.730 --> 27:30.940
and he used his last bit of money
to fucking do it.

27:31.024 --> 27:32.650
I swear to fuck, that's true.

27:34.110 --> 27:36.946
Well, I find that
fucking hard to believe.

27:37.030 --> 27:38.406
-Sorry...
-[sighing] Look, Bubs...

27:38.490 --> 27:41.201
Yes, me and Julian,
we do fuck up a lot.

27:41.284 --> 27:43.286
And it's not because
we don't fucking love you.

27:43.370 --> 27:46.289
But man, you can't
fucking leave this park.

27:46.998 --> 27:49.876
Like, we'd be fucked
without you here, man.

27:50.335 --> 27:53.004
We're a fucking team, buddy.
You can't fucking leave us.

27:53.088 --> 27:54.881
Don't leave me here
with just Julian.

27:55.465 --> 27:57.675
-Please don't go, man.
-[Bubbles sighing]

28:01.429 --> 28:04.724
You're fucking lucky that I love you
so much, Ricky.

28:05.266 --> 28:06.893
You fucking asshole.

28:07.394 --> 28:10.105
You're fucking lucky I love you so much
too, you fucking dick.

28:11.356 --> 28:14.859
So what do you say? You want to...
smoke a joint and watch a movie?

28:16.361 --> 28:17.779
[cat meowing]

28:18.780 --> 28:21.449
-Ricky, you're eating cat treats.
-What, these?

28:22.325 --> 28:25.078
-Yes, cat treats.
-Well, these are fucking good.

28:25.578 --> 28:26.996
They expensive?

28:31.042 --> 28:32.710
Just gonna keep
eating them, are you?

28:34.712 --> 28:37.590
[theme music]

29:18.798 --> 29:21.342
[seagulls squawking]

29:32.520 --> 29:37.776
[fish] Fuck! Fuck! Fuck off! Fuck!...

29:37.859 --> 29:40.612
Fuck off! Jesus Christ!

29:43.573 --> 29:44.949
[whispering] Fuck.

29:45.033 --> 29:47.243
[light clicks off]
Fuck off.
