00:02.377 --> 00:04.337
ANNOUNCER 1: <i>Remain seated, please.</i>

00:04.421 --> 00:06.589
(in Spanish)
<i>Please remain seated.</i>

00:07.424 --> 00:09.426
(lively music)

00:11.594 --> 00:12.679
(elephants trumpeting)

00:18.977 --> 00:20.186
MAN: <i>The love of liberty.</i>

00:20.562 --> 00:21.896
(moans)

00:21.980 --> 00:23.356
(screaming)

00:31.197 --> 00:33.241
NARRATOR: <i>For over 30 years,</i>

00:34.743 --> 00:39.748
<i>Disney Parks guests have embarked
on adventures across the galaxy and back.</i>

00:39.831 --> 00:41.541
<i>First, on Star Tours...</i>

00:43.001 --> 00:46.671
As a kid, I 100 percent
bought into the notion

00:46.755 --> 00:48.840
that I had truly stepped aboard
a <i>StarSpeeder.</i>

00:48.923 --> 00:53.303
NARRATOR: <i>...and it's continued to evolve
and innovate throughout the years.</i>

00:53.386 --> 00:55.013
As new adventures happened,

00:55.764 --> 00:57.390
it's been updated along the way.

00:57.974 --> 01:00.560
NARRATOR: <i>But the recent addition
of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge?</i>

01:00.643 --> 01:02.979
-(groans)
<i>-Well, that's more than just an update.</i>

01:03.813 --> 01:06.274
If you're wandering through
Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge,

01:06.357 --> 01:08.026
a place you've only imagined
in your dreams,

01:08.109 --> 01:09.235
<i>it's better than that.</i>

01:09.319 --> 01:11.362
NARRATOR: <i>And while these
state-of-the-art attractions</i>

01:11.446 --> 01:14.240
<i>may have redefined
modern theme park immersion,</i>

01:14.324 --> 01:16.951
<i>the Disney Parks
have been immersing guests</i>

01:17.035 --> 01:19.412
<i>-in fantasy and adventure...</i>
-(shouting)

01:19.496 --> 01:24.084
<i>...ever since the very first day
that Disneyland opened.</i>

01:24.167 --> 01:27.378
To all who come
to this happy place, welcome.

01:27.462 --> 01:31.049
NARRATOR: <i>But this story begins
on Disneyland's second day.</i>

01:31.758 --> 01:32.884
<i>Because on that day,</i>

01:32.967 --> 01:37.013
<i>a special young boy attended the park
for the first time of many.</i>

01:37.097 --> 01:39.808
<i>And that boy was George Lucas.</i>

01:39.891 --> 01:41.351
I was there the second day it opened.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.311
NARRATOR: <i>In fact,
there he is right there!</i>

01:43.394 --> 01:45.480
<i>Probably. Maybe. Who's to say?</i>

01:45.563 --> 01:48.441
<i>Now, of course,
being the young ten-year-old perfectionist</i>

01:48.525 --> 01:51.194
<i>that he was,
he wasn't without his criticisms,</i>

01:51.277 --> 01:54.447
<i>especially when it came
to one area of the park.</i>

01:54.531 --> 01:56.908
Tomorrowland, I thought that was
a portion of the park

01:56.991 --> 01:59.202
that had always been a little less than
what it could have been.

01:59.285 --> 02:03.039
NARRATOR: <i>Well, he obviously missed
the Tomorrowland World Clock.</i>

02:03.123 --> 02:05.208
REPORTER 1: <i>Which tells you, incidentally,
at a glance,</i>

02:05.291 --> 02:08.211
<i>the exact time on any spot on the Earth.</i>

02:13.341 --> 02:16.219
NARRATOR: <i>The nerve of that kid!
What did he know anyway?</i>

02:16.302 --> 02:18.930
<i>Well, lightspeed ahead about 30 years...</i>

02:20.431 --> 02:21.432
(groans)

02:21.891 --> 02:23.893
NARRATOR: <i>A lot. Yeah, he knows a lot.</i>

02:24.727 --> 02:29.315
<i>Because, after all, along with its sequels
and subsequent mountain of merchandising,</i>

02:29.399 --> 02:30.984
Star Wars <i>really was...</i>

02:31.067 --> 02:33.278
REPORTER 2: <i>More than just a movie.</i>

02:33.361 --> 02:36.614
It was a cultural phenomenon
for everyone in that time.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.616
It really changed everything.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.493
NARRATOR: <i>And nowhere more than Hollywood</i>

02:40.577 --> 02:43.913
<i>where the race was on
to create the next sci-fi epic.</i>

02:43.997 --> 02:50.170
<i>But Disney had an ace in the hole,
as it were, with 1979's</i> The Black Hole.

02:50.253 --> 02:52.380
<i>Chock-full of cosmic spectacle,</i>

02:52.463 --> 02:54.716
<i>audiences just weren't
really sucked in by it...</i>

02:54.799 --> 02:56.134
-Hello?
<i>-...as it were.</i>

02:56.217 --> 03:00.805
<i>And this cinematic slump
wasn't just a problem for Disney Studios,</i>

03:00.889 --> 03:05.101
<i>it also put Imagineers like Tony Baxter
in a bit of a pickle.</i>

03:05.185 --> 03:08.438
When you create a ride based on a movie,

03:08.521 --> 03:11.858
it has to be one
that the audience dearly loves.

03:11.941 --> 03:12.942
NARRATOR: <i>Well, of course.</i>

03:13.026 --> 03:17.280
<i>A movie worthy of a theme park ride
would need to have an exciting story,</i>

03:17.363 --> 03:20.450
<i>iconic characters, and cultural impact.</i>

03:20.533 --> 03:21.993
The Black Hole didn't have that.

03:22.076 --> 03:23.077
-NARRATOR: <i>See?</i>
-Help.

03:23.161 --> 03:24.954
<i>-Little bit of a pickle.</i>
-Mm-hm.

03:25.038 --> 03:28.124
NARRATOR: <i>So, Tony took his grievance
to the top of the flagpole,</i>

03:28.208 --> 03:32.545
<i>straight to Walt's son-in-law
and then Disney CEO Ron Miller.</i>

03:32.629 --> 03:34.505
I had gone to him and said,

03:34.881 --> 03:38.468
"You know, some of the films recently
have not connected with the audience

03:38.551 --> 03:40.970
and they're not the big crowd-pleasers."

03:41.054 --> 03:43.890
NARRATOR: <i>Insulting the boss to his face,
Tony continued.</i>

03:43.973 --> 03:47.769
We got to a point where he realized
we did need to partner with someone,

03:47.852 --> 03:49.979
whether it be Steven Spielberg
or George Lucas.

03:50.063 --> 03:54.192
And Steven being so heavily connected
with our competitor, Universal,

03:54.275 --> 03:56.653
<i>the logical thing was to meet with George.</i>

03:56.736 --> 03:59.280
And he was really open to the idea.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.199
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, of course he was! After all...</i>

04:01.282 --> 04:02.533
I've always loved Disneyland.

04:03.117 --> 04:04.953
He says, "I think
what I've been able to do

04:05.036 --> 04:07.288
with the <i>Star Wars</i> series is first rate."

04:07.372 --> 04:10.375
And I think what Disney set up
with Disneyland is first rate.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.961
So a marriage of our two companies

04:13.044 --> 04:15.296
in that regard
seems to be a natural thing.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.257
NARRATOR: <i>Clearly, the feeling was mutual.</i>

04:17.340 --> 04:20.551
<i>And Imagineers like Tom Fitzgerald
couldn't agree more.</i>

04:20.635 --> 04:23.680
We all felt that <i>Star Wars</i>
was a very a Disney film.

04:23.763 --> 04:26.057
Star Wars should be at Disneyland.

04:26.140 --> 04:27.725
NARRATOR: <i>And when it came to exactly</i>

04:27.809 --> 04:30.520
<i>where in the park
they would put Star Wars,</i>

04:30.603 --> 04:32.230
<i>well, that choice was obvious.</i>

04:32.313 --> 04:34.816
I wanted to have an involvement
in Tomorrowland.

04:34.899 --> 04:37.527
I thought that was a portion
of the park that had always been

04:37.610 --> 04:38.820
a little less than
what it could have been.

04:38.903 --> 04:39.904
NARRATOR: <i>Ugh, this again?</i>

04:39.988 --> 04:43.700
<i>Well, the truth is that
while all of the other lands in Disneyland</i>

04:43.783 --> 04:45.868
<i>had remained timeless
throughout the years,</i>

04:45.952 --> 04:50.415
<i>Tomorrowland, by its very nature,
had repeatedly found itself stuck...</i>

04:51.249 --> 04:52.125
<i>in time.</i>

04:52.208 --> 04:54.752
Walt's vision of Tomorrowland
was a science factual.

04:54.836 --> 04:58.381
A step into the future with predictions
of constructive things to come.

04:58.464 --> 05:00.842
And, you know,
that gets dated pretty quickly.

05:00.925 --> 05:05.847
REPORTER 2: <i>Here in Disneyland,
the year is 1986. That's way ahead.</i>

05:05.930 --> 05:09.058
NARRATOR: <i>But a Star Wars attraction
could solve all their problems.</i>

05:09.142 --> 05:10.059
(groans)

05:10.143 --> 05:16.107
<i>It'd be science fiction-y, space-y,
whilst, above all else, remaining...</i>

05:16.190 --> 05:17.900
-Timeless.
<i>-Great!</i>

05:17.984 --> 05:19.319
Now, how do we do it?

05:19.402 --> 05:22.613
NARRATOR: <i>Well, it would be
the world's first Star Wars attraction,</i>

05:22.697 --> 05:24.157
<i>so, you know, no pressure.</i>

05:24.240 --> 05:26.617
It's a real exciting creative challenge.

05:26.701 --> 05:27.994
NARRATOR: <i>For their first big idea...</i>

05:28.077 --> 05:30.955
Well, it's got to be a roller coaster
or some kind of a thrill ride.

05:31.039 --> 05:34.917
NARRATOR: <i>Which isn't exactly
cutting edge. It would need a twist!</i>

05:35.001 --> 05:38.087
Well, we could put a couple
of choice points in the ride.

05:38.171 --> 05:41.466
So, instead of going one way,
you have some choices.

05:41.549 --> 05:42.675
NARRATOR: <i>While definitely innovative,</i>

05:42.759 --> 05:46.804
<i>this idea would create serious issues
with space.</i>

05:46.888 --> 05:49.015
You put three choices
into a roller coaster,

05:49.098 --> 05:52.518
and you suddenly got a building
that's bigger than Anaheim Stadium.

05:54.312 --> 05:57.023
And, by the way, folks,
we already have Space Mountain.

05:57.106 --> 06:01.611
So, we were getting pretty scared about,
you know, how are we gonna deal with this?

06:01.694 --> 06:04.197
And then how do you create
a galaxy far, far away?

06:04.280 --> 06:06.574
A galaxy in any kind of a building?

06:06.657 --> 06:08.785
NARRATOR: <i>Ideas were being struck down.</i>

06:08.868 --> 06:11.454
<i>Until, that is, George visited.</i>

06:11.537 --> 06:13.373
<i>And gave them all a new hope.</i>

06:13.456 --> 06:16.000
Going through the hallways,
George happened to see a storyboard

06:16.084 --> 06:18.044
that was hanging
on one of the walls in the hallway

06:18.127 --> 06:22.048
<i>that showed a series of images
of white water rafts, airplanes,</i>

06:22.131 --> 06:23.633
<i>and he asked what it was.</i>

06:23.716 --> 06:26.719
Turned out that that storyboard
was a result of a trip

06:26.803 --> 06:29.722
that some of our Imagineers
had made to London.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.600
By complete coincidence, Randy Bright,

06:32.683 --> 06:34.685
<i>who worked with the film
end at Imagineering,</i>

06:34.769 --> 06:35.895
<i>had just come back from England.</i>

06:35.978 --> 06:37.355
TONY: <i>And while he was over there,
someone said,</i>

06:37.438 --> 06:39.315
"Hey, you guys are into rides
and all that stuff.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.651
You should go out
and see this industrial company

06:41.734 --> 06:42.777
<i>called Rediffusion."</i>

06:42.860 --> 06:44.695
<i>And he went out there
and he looked at a simulator</i>

06:44.779 --> 06:45.780
<i>that had been used both</i>

06:45.863 --> 06:48.199
<i>for commercial pilots
and military training.</i>

06:48.616 --> 06:51.411
Simulator built like these.

06:51.494 --> 06:54.247
They were interested in getting
into the leisure business,

06:54.330 --> 06:56.833
and so we're looking to see
whether that same technology

06:56.916 --> 06:59.085
could be used for theme park applications.

06:59.377 --> 07:01.587
NARRATOR:
<i>And this all sounded quite good to George.</i>

07:01.671 --> 07:05.258
He said, "I think that might be
an interesting thing for Star Wars."

07:05.341 --> 07:09.220
Pretty soon after that, Tony Baxter and I
were on a plane to London.

07:09.303 --> 07:10.972
NARRATOR: <i>Their mission? To investigate</i>

07:12.140 --> 07:15.309
<i>this "technological terror"
for themselves.</i>

07:15.393 --> 07:17.854
They had this crude mock-up in a warehouse

07:17.937 --> 07:20.356
<i>where they had taken
a few old airline seats,</i>

07:20.440 --> 07:22.191
<i>strapped them to a plywood floor.</i>

07:22.275 --> 07:24.694
I think we all took Dramamine.
We were scared.

07:24.777 --> 07:28.239
NARRATOR: <i>Nevertheless,
the daring and dosed-up Imagineers</i>

07:28.322 --> 07:30.450
<i>dove into the dangerous device.</i>

07:30.533 --> 07:35.413
They had a video projector and a screen,
and they had taken some POV stock footage.

07:35.496 --> 07:38.040
NARRATOR: <i>Cutting-edge stock footage of...</i>

07:38.708 --> 07:39.876
A roller coaster.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.921
So, we've abandoned the idea
of doing a roller coaster,

07:44.005 --> 07:46.883
and we're now gonna get in this thing,
and we're gonna watch a roller coaster.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.635
NARRATOR: <i>A roller coaster?
What kind of pilots are they training?</i>

07:49.719 --> 07:51.012
This motion-based simulator

07:51.095 --> 07:53.681
was meant to train pilots
in smooth flights.

07:55.057 --> 07:56.267
(clears throat)

07:56.350 --> 07:58.186
Which was not what we wanted to do.

07:58.269 --> 07:59.353
And, in fact, some of the things

07:59.437 --> 08:02.565
that we asked them
to test for us that day...

08:02.648 --> 08:04.817
<i>how fast can it do this,
how fast can it do that...</i>

08:04.901 --> 08:05.943
I think broke it.

08:07.570 --> 08:08.821
(clears throat)

08:08.905 --> 08:12.325
With all the flaws and all the problems,
we lived and came out of it,

08:12.408 --> 08:15.828
and we went, "Wow, that was experiences
I've never had before."

08:15.912 --> 08:19.999
We flew back to California very excited
that this was technology

08:20.082 --> 08:23.336
that could be used to put people
into Star Wars.

08:23.419 --> 08:27.089
So, we began working
on how we could flesh that out.

08:27.173 --> 08:30.510
NARRATOR: <i>Meanwhile, within Lucasfilm,
people were starting to wonder,</i>

08:30.593 --> 08:32.637
<i>"What's George cooking up with Disney?"</i>

08:32.720 --> 08:36.933
And in hearing about it, it seemed like it
would be a pretty neat thing to do.

08:37.016 --> 08:39.685
But, you know, I didn't even know
what a simulator ride was.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.730
NARRATOR: <i>Oh, but he will,
as would many at ILM.</i>

08:42.813 --> 08:47.485
<i>George's Industrial Light and Magic
were world leaders in visual effects.</i>

08:47.568 --> 08:51.781
<i>They were behind this,
this, and, of course, this.</i>

08:51.864 --> 08:54.367
<i>And much like Walt and his Imagineers,</i>

08:54.450 --> 08:57.495
<i>ILM had a strong creative hierarchy</i>

08:57.578 --> 09:00.081
<i>focused on bringing
George's visions to life.</i>

09:00.164 --> 09:02.833
<i>And in doing so,
everyone knew their roles.</i>

09:02.917 --> 09:05.545
I'm Dennis Muren. On Star Tours,

09:05.628 --> 09:08.673
I was the effects supervisor
slash maybe director,

09:08.756 --> 09:11.133
'cause there wasn't anybody else
around to direct it.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.220
So, you know, that's it.

09:14.512 --> 09:15.596
NARRATOR: <i>No, that's not it.</i>

09:15.680 --> 09:17.640
<i>Dennis also just happens to be</i>

09:17.723 --> 09:23.854
<i>a nine-time Academy
Award-winning visual effects legend!</i>

09:24.772 --> 09:28.901
<i>So, while Dennis figured out
how to split his time between Star Tours</i>

09:28.985 --> 09:30.945
<i>and finding more shelf space,</i>

09:31.028 --> 09:33.864
<i>the Imagineers turned their attention
to figuring out...</i>

09:33.948 --> 09:34.949
How does this thing work?

09:35.032 --> 09:36.784
TOM: <i>We were gonna do things
with this machine</i>

09:36.867 --> 09:39.161
<i>that it was never really intended to do.</i>

09:39.245 --> 09:40.496
And what we discovered was...

09:40.580 --> 09:43.749
While you're in motion, we're capable
of going 15 feet to the left,

09:43.833 --> 09:46.586
15 feet to the right,
15 feet up, 15 feet down.

09:46.669 --> 09:49.964
And so, it had a precarious feeling in it.

09:50.047 --> 09:51.340
NARRATOR: <i>Or, in other words...</i>

09:51.424 --> 09:54.218
-It pretty quickly made you motion sick.
-(groaning)

09:54.302 --> 09:56.596
And that turned out to be
an art and a science

09:56.679 --> 09:59.765
that they had not mastered
that we had to master at Imagineering

09:59.849 --> 10:02.727
so that it is fun and not nauseating.

10:02.810 --> 10:04.186
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, if that didn't make them sick,</i>

10:04.270 --> 10:07.898
<i>the sheer quantity of all
the other problems that they had might.</i>

10:07.982 --> 10:10.693
There were lots of challenges
to making that initial cabin work.

10:10.776 --> 10:11.944
NARRATOR: <i>Oh! Go on.</i>

10:12.028 --> 10:14.113
How are we going to get people
in and out of it?

10:14.196 --> 10:16.240
Because lots of people
are going to want to go on this.

10:16.324 --> 10:18.242
We need capacity. We need 40 people.

10:18.326 --> 10:21.329
We can't have a single door at the back
where everybody has to file out.

10:21.412 --> 10:22.413
We've got to be efficient.

10:22.496 --> 10:25.207
We're gonna have to create doors
and elevators that come down

10:25.291 --> 10:26.626
and are there immediately.

10:27.126 --> 10:30.004
We need to have doors on the left
and doors on the right

10:30.087 --> 10:33.257
because to get that capacity,
we need what we call through-loading.

10:33.341 --> 10:34.342
Okay, that can be done.

10:34.425 --> 10:36.218
NARRATOR:
<i>Phew. Well, that's solved. What else?</i>

10:36.302 --> 10:37.595
It had to be filmed.

10:37.678 --> 10:38.763
'Cause video didn't exist.

10:38.846 --> 10:41.307
NARRATOR: <i>What are you talking about?
Betamax was more than...</i>

10:41.390 --> 10:43.476
<i>Mmm, okay. Good point.</i>

10:43.559 --> 10:46.228
We wanna add
a 70-millimeter film projector.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.563
I've got to have a loop cabinet.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.898
NARRATOR: <i>Ah, a loop cabinet.</i>

10:48.981 --> 10:51.692
<i>Well, let's circle back a few years
on that loop cabinet.</i>

10:51.776 --> 10:55.279
TOM: <i>Disneyland had
a Circle-Vision presentation, Circarama,</i>

10:55.363 --> 10:57.531
and there were problems with it.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.450
NARRATOR:
<i>Namely the film in the projector.</i>

10:59.533 --> 11:02.328
They're scratching, they're breaking,
we're losing panels.

11:02.411 --> 11:05.039
NARRATOR: <i>This was a problem
that no one could have projected.</i>

11:05.122 --> 11:10.211
<i>Luckily, a solution had been concocted
by legendary Disney animator, inventor,</i>

11:10.294 --> 11:14.632
<i>and, not to mention, Mickey Mouse
co-creator himself, Ub Iwerks.</i>

11:14.715 --> 11:18.427
A loop cabinet, which is basically
rather than a film being on a spool,

11:18.511 --> 11:20.471
<i>the film is always just moving
through this cabinet</i>

11:20.554 --> 11:22.431
<i>over rollers in a big loop.</i>

11:22.515 --> 11:25.935
The film never touches itself,
so it never scratched.

11:26.018 --> 11:27.978
And it made these presentations

11:28.062 --> 11:32.316
in the park able to run
with less maintenance and better show.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.902
NARRATOR: <i>But the Star Wars attraction
had to be the best show!</i>

11:34.985 --> 11:40.157
<i>And so Ub Iwerks' Circarama loop cabinet
would be looped in to Star Tours!</i>

11:40.241 --> 11:45.413
<i>But one particular obstacle went far, far
beyond simply attraction mechanics.</i>

11:45.496 --> 11:46.831
Now we had to find the story.

11:47.331 --> 11:50.042
<i>So, we came up with different concepts.</i>

11:50.126 --> 11:53.796
One was more like a military training
like you were being trained

11:53.879 --> 11:55.756
<i>to go off into battle.</i>

11:55.840 --> 11:59.343
NARRATOR: <i>Nice. Death from above
by way of deadly dogfight.</i>

11:59.427 --> 12:00.469
-(screams)
<i>-Sounds fun.</i>

12:00.553 --> 12:02.304
Disneyland is the happiest place on Earth.

12:02.388 --> 12:03.514
(yelling)

12:03.597 --> 12:04.515
(screaming)

12:04.598 --> 12:05.933
Many Bothans died.

12:06.016 --> 12:09.353
That didn't mesh up as well
with the Disneyland DNA.

12:09.854 --> 12:12.857
NARRATOR: <i>Back at ILM,
the wizards of movie magic</i>

12:12.940 --> 12:14.608
<i>were taking a shot at the story.</i>

12:14.692 --> 12:17.445
An idea I had for it
is that the audience members

12:17.528 --> 12:19.113
who are coming in and sitting down,

12:19.196 --> 12:21.157
once it gets going, you realize

12:22.158 --> 12:23.033
that you are Luke.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.744
NARRATOR: <i>But that idea got tossed,</i>

12:25.745 --> 12:29.623
<i>leaving Tony and Tom with one last idea
tucked up their sleeve.</i>

12:29.707 --> 12:30.666
A tour company.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.251
NARRATOR:
<i>And the tour company was called...</i>

12:32.334 --> 12:33.502
Cosmic Winds.

12:34.086 --> 12:35.171
Uh...

12:35.254 --> 12:38.090
Like a tour bus with a comedic approach.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.634
-(bus horn honks)
-(people giggling)

12:40.718 --> 12:43.179
The tour company was just a,
you know, wildcard.

12:43.262 --> 12:46.348
NARRATOR: <i>And George,
well, being the joker that he is...</i>

12:47.600 --> 12:50.603
<i>A comical tour of the galaxy
was the perfect choice.</i>

12:50.686 --> 12:52.521
He just thought that was more Disneyland.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.106
NARRATOR: <i>Clearly, the best idea had won.</i>

12:54.190 --> 12:55.566
It doesn't matter, really.

12:55.649 --> 12:57.985
You know, we're just doing...
People are just coming to see <i>Star Wars.</i>

12:58.068 --> 13:00.488
NARRATOR: <i>But anyway,
don't stress too much about the story.</i>

13:00.571 --> 13:02.406
<i>This attraction was just a film</i>

13:02.490 --> 13:05.493
<i>set inside a re-programmable
hydraulic machine.</i>

13:05.576 --> 13:08.329
<i>They can change the story
anytime they like.</i>

13:08.412 --> 13:11.081
<i>And George liked that idea best.</i>

13:11.165 --> 13:12.750
I think this will give us a big advantage

13:12.833 --> 13:16.420
in being able to upgrade the ride
after a certain period of time.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.214
NARRATOR: <i>So, for now, it's settled.</i>

13:18.297 --> 13:21.842
So, we have a tour company.
It's gonna be an airport-type experience.

13:21.926 --> 13:24.762
And that tour company
was gonna take you to some of the planets.

13:24.845 --> 13:28.808
And, accidentally, you're gonna
get pulled into a battle sequence.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.518
-(screaming)
-NARRATOR: <i>Wait, this again?</i>

13:30.601 --> 13:32.144
-Accidentally.
<i>-Fine.</i>

13:32.228 --> 13:34.939
<i>So, then where would
this accidental battle take place?</i>

13:35.022 --> 13:37.525
The trench.
I've got to be in that somehow.

13:37.608 --> 13:39.068
<i>-Of course.</i>
-Yahoo!

13:39.151 --> 13:41.403
NARRATOR:
<i>This iconic scene would be perfect for...</i>

13:41.487 --> 13:44.281
Really? I mean, we did that before.
What could we do differently?

13:44.365 --> 13:48.160
They didn't wanna do any shot
that they had done in one of the films.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.370
But it was important to do.

13:49.453 --> 13:51.914
TOM: <i>That is the climactic moment
as a guest that,</i>

13:51.997 --> 13:55.668
"Yep, I'm in it, and I'm shooting
that shot that takes out the Death Star."

13:55.751 --> 13:58.838
"Yeah, but you've seen it before."
That's what I thought, you know?

13:58.921 --> 14:01.173
And then so we were at a impasse.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.968
NARRATOR: <i>But there was one who could
bring about balance in the Force.</i>

14:04.051 --> 14:06.929
Dennis just said to me, "You're gonna
have to get George to agree to that."

14:07.012 --> 14:10.933
So, George said, "I, I think, kind of,
Tony has a point there, you know?

14:11.016 --> 14:13.310
I feel that maybe we should have that."

14:13.394 --> 14:17.356
And that shows you what Tony and Tom know
because they deal with the public.

14:17.439 --> 14:20.401
It's entirely different seeing it
on the simulator than in the movie,

14:20.776 --> 14:22.236
and you, like, got to have it there.

14:22.319 --> 14:23.279
DENNIS: <i>You've got to.</i>

14:23.362 --> 14:25.614
NARRATOR:
<i>But soon enough, the tables would turn</i>

14:26.198 --> 14:28.742
<i>because the entire premise
of the simulator</i>

14:28.826 --> 14:31.453
<i>was based around iconic</i> Star Wars <i>visuals.</i>

14:32.413 --> 14:34.707
<i>But Imagineers only knew
how to make attractions.</i>

14:35.040 --> 14:37.710
<i>So they turned to Dennis
to make them a movie.</i>

14:37.793 --> 14:38.961
-No, no, no, no.
-NARRATOR: <i>No?</i>

14:39.044 --> 14:41.005
-No.
-It's not a movie.

14:41.088 --> 14:42.464
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, if it's not a movie, then...</i>

14:42.548 --> 14:44.258
-It's a window.
<i>-Oh!</i>

14:44.341 --> 14:46.886
<i>It's essentially one shot
from beginning to end.</i>

14:46.969 --> 14:49.972
The window's got to stay the window
the entire time.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.390
If it's a point of view,

14:51.473 --> 14:55.477
<i>you've got no opportunity
to cut away from what's in front of you.</i>

14:55.561 --> 14:57.521
DENNIS: <i>You always are looking
at what's going on.</i>

14:57.605 --> 15:00.316
So, you've got to travel
from the spaceport at Disneyland...

15:00.399 --> 15:02.860
(screaming)

15:02.943 --> 15:04.028
...and then back home.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.487
TONY: <i>From Dennis' perspective,</i>

15:05.905 --> 15:10.075
the only way to get from a model
to a matte painting or whatever was...

15:10.159 --> 15:12.036
Where to put these invisible cuts?

15:12.119 --> 15:14.330
NARRATOR: <i>But Dennis doesn't have
all those awards for nothing.</i>

15:14.413 --> 15:18.417
So, I had to fall back on what we did
in some of the original Star Wars films,

15:18.500 --> 15:20.210
which was a good old laser flash.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.254
DENNIS: <i>You know, one white frame</i>

15:22.338 --> 15:24.506
<i>on the screen, you can do a transition.</i>

15:24.590 --> 15:26.258
And there's a number of those in the show.

15:27.426 --> 15:29.094
There's a number of things

15:29.178 --> 15:31.096
where something goes real quickly
by the camera...

15:31.180 --> 15:32.473
RX-24: <i>Comets!</i>

15:32.556 --> 15:36.226
...where everything is lost
and blurs in darkness for a frame or two,

15:36.310 --> 15:38.187
<i>and that's points
of making other transitions.</i>

15:38.270 --> 15:39.647
(yelling)

15:41.023 --> 15:45.486
NARRATOR: <i>So, with at least some ideas
on how to pull it off, ILM got to work.</i>

15:45.569 --> 15:48.906
We had to deliver a,
you know, a 5-minute movie.

15:48.989 --> 15:50.741
-NARRATOR: <i>Wait, don't forget.</i>
-It's a window.

15:50.824 --> 15:54.536
NARRATOR: <i>And with the window
quickly closing in on opening day,</i>

15:54.620 --> 15:58.123
<i>Dennis Muren and ILM
began filming this script,</i>

15:58.207 --> 16:01.794
<i>carefully written
and not to be deviated from, because...</i>

16:01.877 --> 16:05.839
You have to film something
to match what the simulator can do.

16:05.923 --> 16:08.801
NARRATOR:
<i>Or, more precisely, what it couldn't do.</i>

16:08.884 --> 16:12.054
We learned we were going to have
to create the content

16:12.137 --> 16:14.848
around the limitations
of what the machine can do

16:14.932 --> 16:16.600
rather than the other way around.

16:16.684 --> 16:20.729
NARRATOR: <i>And the biggest limitation was
also the attraction's greatest strength,</i>

16:20.813 --> 16:23.857
<i>that being those powerful
pneumatic pressure hydraulics.</i>

16:23.941 --> 16:25.776
When you exhaust all the cylinders,

16:25.859 --> 16:27.403
<i>and so you're down at the bottom</i>

16:27.486 --> 16:29.363
<i>and you can't give anyone
a thrill, really,</i>

16:29.780 --> 16:34.493
you have to write a scene into the show
that allows you to recover that energy.

16:34.576 --> 16:37.454
So, "Uh-oh,
we're caught in a tractor beam!"

16:37.538 --> 16:40.874
(imitates Star Wars soundtrack)

16:41.458 --> 16:43.127
TONY: <i>And while that music is playing,</i>

16:43.210 --> 16:44.420
<i>we're pulling you back up</i>

16:44.503 --> 16:47.089
<i>to the full extent
of those 15-foot cylinders,</i>

16:47.548 --> 16:51.051
<i>getting the energy back into the system
so we can go for another thrill.</i>

16:52.177 --> 16:54.513
But it was actually fun to find ways

16:54.596 --> 16:57.307
to take advantage
of all these limitations.

16:57.391 --> 16:59.268
NARRATOR: <i>But, of course,
there's no greater limitation</i>

16:59.351 --> 17:01.145
<i>than an unmanned</i> StarSpeeder.

17:01.228 --> 17:03.731
<i>So, who's flying this thing anyway?</i>

17:03.814 --> 17:04.857
As the story developed,

17:04.940 --> 17:08.360
George wanted to have a physical pilot
with you on the ship,

17:08.444 --> 17:09.820
<i>not something on a monitor,</i>

17:09.903 --> 17:13.198
and we had to figure out
what this character would be.

17:13.282 --> 17:15.409
NARRATOR: <i>Well, wonder no more.
Reporting for duty...</i>

17:15.492 --> 17:16.368
<i>Hi there!</i>

17:16.452 --> 17:19.079
<i>...was RX-24,
or as his friends call him...</i>

17:19.163 --> 17:20.581
<i>Captain Rex from the cockpit.</i>

17:20.664 --> 17:23.959
<i>But unlike the other well-known,
beloved droids</i>

17:24.043 --> 17:25.210
<i>of the Star Wars universe...</i>

17:25.294 --> 17:29.131
We really only had about, oh,
I don't know, 12 to 15 seconds, maybe,

17:29.214 --> 17:31.216
for you to fall in love
with this new character

17:31.300 --> 17:32.718
because we had to get onto the ride.

17:32.801 --> 17:34.094
NARRATOR: <i>So, how do you do that?</i>

17:34.178 --> 17:37.306
Well, I have to make this character
be a little goofy.

17:37.389 --> 17:38.432
<i>It was my first flight</i>

17:38.515 --> 17:40.893
<i>and I'm still getting used
to my programming!</i>

17:40.976 --> 17:42.853
That raises the stakes of nervousness
for the audience.

17:42.936 --> 17:44.438
"What do you mean?
He's never flown this before

17:44.521 --> 17:45.606
and we're gonna fly with him?"

17:45.689 --> 17:48.233
NARRATOR: <i>But to really grab
a guest's attention...</i>

17:48.317 --> 17:49.276
Gonna do a lot of screaming.

17:49.359 --> 17:51.111
(screaming)

17:51.195 --> 17:54.782
NARRATOR: <i>Wait a minute.
A little goofy, screams a lot...</i>

17:54.865 --> 17:55.908
(screaming)

17:55.991 --> 17:57.326
<i>Could it be the voice of...</i>

17:57.409 --> 17:58.410
Oh, Pee-wee Herman.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.579
R2, lightspeed to Endor!

18:00.871 --> 18:03.957
Paul Reubens giving us a character
that was akin to Pee-wee Herman.

18:04.041 --> 18:07.419
First day, kind of nervous,
funny, and great screams.

18:07.503 --> 18:09.213
(screams)

18:09.296 --> 18:13.300
NARRATOR: <i>So Pee-wee Herman would make
the voice work on this big adventure.</i>

18:13.383 --> 18:15.427
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
there may be some turbulence up ahead.</i>

18:15.511 --> 18:16.762
<i>Make sure your seat belts are fastened.</i>

18:16.845 --> 18:17.721
NARRATOR: <i>But...</i>

18:17.805 --> 18:20.974
How is that robot going to work
all day long, being thrown around?

18:21.058 --> 18:23.268
And, and what... How do...
You have to think about it differently

18:23.352 --> 18:26.396
than, say, Mr. Lincoln
in the Lincoln show.

18:26.855 --> 18:29.983
TOM: <i>Can't have too many functions,
can't have this be too heavy.</i>

18:30.067 --> 18:31.568
It's going to be bolted down.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.904
<i>But he has to have kind of
a lightspeed kind of moment.</i>

18:33.987 --> 18:35.697
<i>He's got to face the audience.
He's got to have eyes.</i>

18:35.781 --> 18:37.866
He's got to have expression
in his personality,

18:37.950 --> 18:40.244
so his visor is going to be
really important.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.663
You know, all of those things
are adding to the complexity of this thing

18:42.746 --> 18:45.707
that's being shaken
around all day long, every day.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.710
NARRATOR: <i>He's right. Rex was going
to have a lot of first flights.</i>

18:48.794 --> 18:52.965
<i>And as his very first, first flight
and opening day grew closer,</i>

18:53.048 --> 18:55.425
<i>there was one last thing to get right.</i>

18:55.509 --> 18:58.554
<i>That is the first thing guests experience.</i>

18:58.637 --> 19:02.432
The maintenance hangar, as we call it,
when people first enter the attraction,

19:02.516 --> 19:05.185
<i>they will see their friends R2-D2
and Threepio.</i>

19:05.269 --> 19:07.855
Those things take us back
to a comfort zone

19:07.938 --> 19:10.858
<i>and you're about, now,
to enter that experience.</i>

19:10.941 --> 19:12.568
I think George really put it best
the other day

19:12.651 --> 19:14.027
when he got off it and said...

19:14.111 --> 19:15.863
Great.
(chuckles)

19:15.946 --> 19:17.906
For about the 300th time,
it was still great.

19:17.990 --> 19:21.285
NARRATOR:
<i>And George's overwhelming enthusiasm</i>

19:21.368 --> 19:23.704
<i>was a good indication
of what was about to come.</i>

19:23.787 --> 19:26.832
C-3PO:
<i>Today is the grand opening of Star Tours.</i>

19:27.916 --> 19:32.004
NARRATOR: <i>The occasion was kicked off
by an exciting grand opening ceremony.</i>

19:32.087 --> 19:33.589
For the most part, it was all exciting.

19:33.672 --> 19:34.923
<i>Wait, "for the most part"?</i>

19:35.007 --> 19:38.719
We affectionately refer to it
as the Darth Vader Ballet.

19:38.802 --> 19:39.803
<i>The what, now?</i>

19:39.887 --> 19:41.013
The Darth Vader Ballet.

19:42.139 --> 19:47.102
You had Disney-style entertainment
combined with the characters of <i>Star Wars.</i>

19:47.186 --> 19:48.854
You kind of have to see it to believe it.

19:48.937 --> 19:49.980
(grunts)

19:50.063 --> 19:51.106
It's rather interesting.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.233
NARRATOR:
<i>And while the performance was a smash,</i>

19:53.317 --> 19:55.944
<i>there were ribbons to be cut
and stars to be toured</i>

19:56.028 --> 19:58.572
<i>by throngs of eager Disneyland guests</i>

19:58.655 --> 20:01.366
<i>who were lined up all the way
to the front gates...</i>

20:01.450 --> 20:03.452
The park stayed open around the clock.

20:03.535 --> 20:06.079
NARRATOR: <i>...for three straight days!</i>

20:06.163 --> 20:08.457
Because no one
had ever seen anything like it.

20:08.540 --> 20:09.499
I loved it.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.835
It was just the best. It was so good.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.128
(screaming)

20:13.212 --> 20:16.256
It's a film,
but you're moving to the film.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.050
And it's like you're in space.

20:18.133 --> 20:20.427
Aw, this is so cool!

20:21.094 --> 20:23.305
(screaming)

20:23.388 --> 20:24.681
And of course you got out,
right back in line,

20:24.765 --> 20:25.807
got in again, rode it again.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.393
(screaming)

20:30.145 --> 20:32.689
<i>Sorry, folks!
I'm sure I'll do better next time!</i>

20:32.773 --> 20:34.608
NARRATOR:
<i>Rex never really got the hang of it,</i>

20:34.691 --> 20:37.027
<i>but he certainly racked up
some flying hours...</i>

20:37.110 --> 20:39.071
<i>Lightspeed to Endor!</i>

20:39.154 --> 20:43.408
NARRATOR: <i>...because Star Tours continued
its nonstop flights out of Anaheim</i>

20:43.492 --> 20:46.662
<i>and just outside of Orlando,
followed by Tokyo</i>

20:46.745 --> 20:47.871
<i>and Paris!</i>

20:47.955 --> 20:49.831
(in French)
<i>I am Rex, your captain.</i>

20:49.915 --> 20:53.877
NARRATOR: <i>Well into the next decade,
its legacy stowed securely</i>

20:53.961 --> 20:57.089
<i>in the baggage compartment
of beloved Disney attractions.</i>

20:57.464 --> 20:58.715
(groans)

20:59.424 --> 21:01.718
NARRATOR: <i>And yet, as the years went by,</i>

21:02.094 --> 21:05.097
<i>a distant whisper remained
hung on the wind.</i>

21:05.514 --> 21:08.642
<i>We can upgrade the ride
after a certain period of time.</i>

21:10.394 --> 21:12.562
<i>That was originally the plan.</i>

21:12.646 --> 21:17.401
<i>But from that opening day
in 1987 and beyond,</i>

21:17.484 --> 21:20.070
<i>Star Tours remained untouched.</i>

21:20.153 --> 21:23.573
Because the film that we had in there
was working just great.

21:23.657 --> 21:26.368
And so, from the park perspective
and the guest perspective is,

21:26.451 --> 21:27.911
why would we change it?

21:27.995 --> 21:29.413
NARRATOR: <i>Well, here's one reason...</i>

21:32.958 --> 21:36.378
TOM: <i>George went back into</i> Star Wars
<i>and said, "I'm doing the prequels."</i>

21:36.461 --> 21:38.088
-What?
-And we said, "Aha."

21:38.547 --> 21:42.175
We have an opportunity to go in there now
and change the story.

21:42.259 --> 21:44.511
NARRATOR: <i>Great! Now... what story?</i>

21:44.594 --> 21:46.096
We knew nothing about the story.

21:46.179 --> 21:48.181
TOM: <i>But George showed us a podrace.</i>

21:48.265 --> 21:52.144
NARRATOR: <i>You couldn't get
a more perfect scene to update Star Tours.</i>

21:52.227 --> 21:53.395
<i>Jumping into action...</i>

21:53.478 --> 21:57.149
We came back to Imagineering
and we boarded out a podrace.

21:57.232 --> 21:59.276
NARRATOR:
<i>...the Star Tours update sped towards...</i>

21:59.359 --> 22:02.946
Well, wait.
What's going to be in Episode II?

22:03.530 --> 22:05.657
I mean, maybe we should wait and see
what's in Episode II

22:05.741 --> 22:07.075
and then we'll decide what we wanna do.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.493
NARRATOR: <i>And so they did,</i>

22:08.577 --> 22:10.287
<i>before then sitting down
to hash out the...</i>

22:10.370 --> 22:11.246
-Well...
<i>-Ugh!</i>

22:11.330 --> 22:13.790
We might as well wait for Episode III

22:13.874 --> 22:15.375
-and see what's in Episode III.
-NARRATOR: <i>See what's in Episode III.</i>

22:15.459 --> 22:16.293
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

22:16.376 --> 22:18.170
You wanna be really certain,
when you make a choice,

22:18.253 --> 22:22.215
<i>that you've made the right choice
that this will be the scene from</i> Star Wars

22:22.299 --> 22:24.676
that guests will be so excited
to step into.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.512
NARRATOR: <i>And this presented
the Imagineers with a challenge.</i>

22:27.596 --> 22:28.930
We had 6 episodes,

22:29.014 --> 22:34.936
and we had the difficult task of saying,
"Well, what one story should we do?"

22:35.020 --> 22:38.148
But we were never going to satisfy
the <i>Star Wars</i> fans

22:38.231 --> 22:39.733
by only going to one place, right?

22:39.816 --> 22:41.902
NARRATOR: <i>Right! How do you pick between</i>

22:41.985 --> 22:44.738
<i>Tatooine, Utapau, Hoth, Yavin 4,
Mygeeto, Mustafar...</i>

22:44.821 --> 22:45.822
-Dantooine.
<i>-...thank you,</i>

22:45.906 --> 22:47.699
<i>Endor, Naboo, Coruscant, Geonosis,</i>

22:47.783 --> 22:50.702
<i>Bespin, Cato Neimoidia,
Felucia, Dagobah, Alder...</i>

22:50.786 --> 22:52.454
<i>Ah! Maybe not Alderaan.</i>

22:52.537 --> 22:54.289
<i>Kamino or Kashyyyk?</i>

22:54.373 --> 22:56.124
We couldn't figure it out.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.877
NARRATOR: <i>Luckily, the team had
one thing going for them.</i>

22:59.544 --> 23:00.462
New technologies.

23:00.545 --> 23:02.589
-NARRATOR: <i>And now...</i>
-TOM: <i>Now we're ready for video,</i>

23:02.672 --> 23:04.216
now we can do 3-D,

23:04.299 --> 23:07.511
and now we can do more storytelling
than we were able to do before.

23:07.594 --> 23:08.845
NARRATOR: <i>Without the heft of...</i>

23:08.929 --> 23:10.597
A 70-millimeter film projector.

23:10.680 --> 23:12.474
NARRATOR:
<i>...and the subsequent loop cabinet,</i>

23:12.557 --> 23:14.601
<i>the galaxy was their playground.</i>

23:14.684 --> 23:17.562
If we're gonna go to video,
why does it have to be one?

23:17.646 --> 23:20.232
And that led to what I call
the slot machine approach

23:20.690 --> 23:24.820
where you had a first act, second act,
and a finale,

23:25.237 --> 23:30.242
and you could make those the same length
so that you could hop from wheel to wheel.

23:30.325 --> 23:32.494
You could get a lot
of different combinations.

23:32.577 --> 23:33.537
NARRATOR: <i>Well, for example...</i>

23:33.620 --> 23:36.039
As soon as you start the story,

23:36.123 --> 23:38.250
<i>you're either gonna get confronted
with Darth Vader</i>

23:38.333 --> 23:40.460
<i>saying that you have a Rebel spy on board.</i>

23:40.794 --> 23:43.004
SCOT: <i>Or the Millennium Falcon's
gonna be there,</i>

23:43.088 --> 23:44.506
<i>they're going to get into some trouble,</i>

23:44.589 --> 23:45.507
and they're going to need to escape,

23:45.590 --> 23:46.925
and we're going to need
to escape with them.

23:47.300 --> 23:48.885
<i>Now, because we're rushing,</i>

23:48.969 --> 23:52.431
we're going to go to lightspeed
without having time to set coordinates.

23:52.514 --> 23:54.015
So, you don't know
where you're gonna end up.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.267
<i>So, we come out of lightspeed,</i>

23:55.350 --> 23:58.186
<i>and now we have more options
of where you could end up.</i>

23:58.270 --> 24:00.605
NARRATOR: <i>And so on, and so on,</i>

24:00.689 --> 24:03.108
<i>before safely returning you
to the spaceport.</i>

24:03.191 --> 24:06.695
There's more variables than,
probably, anyone can ever experience,

24:06.778 --> 24:07.654
<i>and that was the goal.</i>

24:07.737 --> 24:10.365
NARRATOR: <i>But the goal was also
to get George's approval.</i>

24:10.449 --> 24:12.826
We got called up to the ranch.

24:13.493 --> 24:15.120
NARRATOR: <i>Skywalker Ranch, that is.</i>

24:15.203 --> 24:17.539
<i>Lucasfilm's base of operations
at the time.</i>

24:17.622 --> 24:21.668
So, a ton of pressure to go up there
and talk about these new ideas.

24:21.751 --> 24:24.713
Even though it had been 20 years
since we had updated, we had a big idea.

24:24.796 --> 24:27.299
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, being known for big ideas himself...</i>

24:27.382 --> 24:30.469
He liked the idea,
he added a few comments.

24:30.552 --> 24:32.471
NARRATOR: <i>As we know about Imagineers...</i>

24:32.554 --> 24:33.972
We make the impossible possible.

24:34.055 --> 24:37.017
NARRATOR: <i>So, when George had
a relatively simple request...</i>

24:37.100 --> 24:41.396
George Lucas wanted us
to have water spray into the cabin.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.440
(screaming)

24:43.523 --> 24:45.484
NARRATOR:
<i>After considering George's request...</i>

24:45.567 --> 24:46.651
Uh...

24:46.735 --> 24:48.445
NARRATOR: <i>The Imagineers said...</i>

24:49.321 --> 24:50.697
No.

24:50.780 --> 24:54.493
That one we cannot do
because water over time will cause rust,

24:54.576 --> 24:55.660
will cause corrosion.

24:55.744 --> 24:57.704
NARRATOR: <i>But don't worry.
George had other ideas too.</i>

24:57.787 --> 25:01.875
George wanted us to have a spy
in the audience.

25:02.167 --> 25:05.003
What if, actually, we could take a picture

25:05.086 --> 25:06.671
of someone in the cabin

25:06.755 --> 25:08.131
<i>and put it up on the screen</i>

25:08.215 --> 25:11.384
and really let a guest see themselves
as a Rebel spy.

25:11.468 --> 25:13.303
NARRATOR:
<i>And if that didn't grab your attention...</i>

25:13.386 --> 25:15.722
In 3-D, we have something
we call "flinch moments"

25:15.805 --> 25:18.683
where I do something that makes you
kind of do this.

25:18.767 --> 25:22.187
And Sebulba, who is the bad guy
in the podrace,

25:22.270 --> 25:24.022
throws a wrench at the windshield,

25:24.105 --> 25:27.734
and we were making
that wrench logical size.

25:27.817 --> 25:30.028
TOM: <i>And George kept pushing it
to make it bigger, bigger,</i>

25:30.111 --> 25:33.740
because he felt it was so fast
that we could take license with it

25:33.823 --> 25:35.825
<i>and it would get a bigger reaction
from the audience.</i>

25:36.910 --> 25:37.869
And he was right.

25:37.953 --> 25:39.788
NARRATOR:
<i>And that's not all George was right about.</i>

25:39.871 --> 25:42.457
We started developing
this character named Ace.

25:43.041 --> 25:44.626
TOM: <i>Kind of like Tom Cruise in Top Gun.</i>

25:44.709 --> 25:46.336
<i>Very cocky, very confident.</i>

25:46.419 --> 25:48.880
NARRATOR: <i>Good at shirtless
beach volleyball, probably?</i>

25:48.964 --> 25:50.840
Where nothing would go wrong.

25:50.924 --> 25:53.385
NARRATOR: <i>Until, that is,
it was George's turn to say...</i>

25:53.468 --> 25:56.763
No!

25:56.846 --> 25:59.516
TOM: <i>George is not buying this.</i>

25:59.599 --> 26:03.395
He wants a pilot that is nervous,
that can be humorous.

26:03.478 --> 26:06.940
NARRATOR: <i>Scrambling for solutions,
the Imagineers frantically...</i>

26:07.023 --> 26:09.609
Wait, we have this character already.

26:09.693 --> 26:12.404
C-3PO: <i>Over here! Hey!</i>

26:12.487 --> 26:13.697
C-3PO.

26:13.780 --> 26:15.407
NARRATOR: <i>Arguably the most nervous and...</i>

26:15.490 --> 26:17.701
-(nervous moan)
<i>-...humorous droid in the galaxy.</i>

26:17.784 --> 26:19.035
<i>How rude.</i>

26:19.119 --> 26:20.245
<i>But the best part...</i>

26:20.328 --> 26:21.371
We have this character.

26:21.454 --> 26:24.082
TOM: <i>We know how to make the robot.
We've got all the tooling.</i>

26:24.165 --> 26:26.042
We just had to figure out
how Threepio got accidentally...

26:26.126 --> 26:27.711
(yelling)

26:27.794 --> 26:29.129
...launched into the adventure.

26:29.212 --> 26:31.214
You leave in such a rush

26:31.298 --> 26:33.842
that you have an all-new surprise pilot
on board,

26:33.925 --> 26:34.968
and that was C-3PO.

26:35.051 --> 26:38.054
<i>I don't think they could've chosen
a better droid for the job.</i>

26:38.138 --> 26:39.848
-NARRATOR: <i>And don't worry, Rex-heads!</i>
-(chuckles)

26:39.931 --> 26:41.266
<i>Imagineers found a way</i>

26:41.349 --> 26:43.310
<i>to keep your old friend along
for the ride...</i>

26:43.393 --> 26:44.394
<i>Welcome aboard...</i>

26:44.477 --> 26:46.605
<i>...in a slightly diminished capacity</i>

26:46.688 --> 26:50.317
<i>in the queue area of Star Tours:
The Adventures Continue</i>

26:50.400 --> 26:52.319
<i>which opened ballet-less</i>

26:52.402 --> 26:54.571
<i>yet still to some exciting fanfare.</i>

26:54.654 --> 26:56.197
<i>And it was quickly obvious</i>

26:56.281 --> 26:58.658
<i>that their slot machine gamble
had paid off.</i>

26:58.742 --> 27:02.912
We had more than 54 different
story combinations that you could ride.

27:02.996 --> 27:04.039
Oh, yeah!

27:04.122 --> 27:05.165
You know, and everyone
has their favorite sequence.

27:05.248 --> 27:06.166
"Oh, I love Hoth."

27:06.541 --> 27:07.709
"Oh, I love Kashyyyk."

27:09.169 --> 27:10.378
NARRATOR: <i>There was plenty to love</i>

27:10.462 --> 27:12.714
<i>about Star Tours: The Adventures Continue.</i>

27:12.797 --> 27:14.424
<i>And lucky for park guests,</i>

27:14.507 --> 27:17.260
<i>a whole new adventure
was just about to begin.</i>

27:17.844 --> 27:22.682
<i>Because in 2012, after nearly 40 years
of running Lucasfilm,</i>

27:22.766 --> 27:24.726
<i>George was ready to call it a day</i>

27:24.809 --> 27:28.271
<i>and put the keys
to the empire in safe hands.</i>

27:28.355 --> 27:32.400
REPORTER 3: Disney expects to release
<i>Star Wars: Episode VII</i> in 2015.

27:32.484 --> 27:33.652
NARRATOR: <i>And it didn't end there.</i>

27:33.735 --> 27:38.239
I'm thrilled to announce the next chapter
between Disney Parks and Star Wars.

27:38.323 --> 27:41.618
-(crowd cheering)
-ROBIN: <i>We saw Bob Iger stand up at D23,</i>

27:41.701 --> 27:44.079
say, "I've challenged the team
to be ambitious."

27:44.162 --> 27:45.455
And we were all sitting
in the audience going...

27:45.538 --> 27:47.082
-Yes!
-(crowd cheering)

27:47.165 --> 27:49.042
It really got a lot of Imagineers excited.

27:49.125 --> 27:51.628
Whoops and hollers, I could hear them
from across the building.

27:51.711 --> 27:54.756
NARRATOR: <i>And soon enough,
everyone was scrambling to get assigned</i>

27:54.839 --> 27:56.591
<i>to the new Star Wars attraction.</i>

27:56.675 --> 27:58.051
Like, "Hey, you guys
got to let me in on this.

27:58.134 --> 27:59.177
You got to let me in on this."

27:59.260 --> 28:01.304
I, like, fangirled out hardcore.

28:01.388 --> 28:05.600
NARRATOR: <i>After all, by 2012,
Disney Imagineering was flush with talent</i>

28:05.684 --> 28:10.480
<i>that had spent their entire lives
worshipping at the altar of</i> Star Wars.

28:10.563 --> 28:12.190
CHRIS: <i>It was part of your childhood,</i>

28:12.273 --> 28:15.610
so that opportunity to then go off
and work on Star Wars,

28:15.694 --> 28:17.862
for me, it was just like getting
to build my own playset.

28:17.946 --> 28:20.657
NARRATOR:
<i>Yep, a really big playset, because...</i>

28:20.740 --> 28:22.742
I knew from the very beginning
that what we were going to do

28:22.826 --> 28:23.993
with Star Wars was going to be big

28:24.077 --> 28:27.831
<i>because we already had a beloved
Star Wars experience in Star Tours.</i>

28:27.914 --> 28:32.377
But we didn't want to just be in a vehicle
or a transport as passive participants,

28:32.460 --> 28:34.671
we wanted to feel like
we were part of the story.

28:34.754 --> 28:37.590
We wanted it to be a place
where we could push deeper immersion.

28:37.674 --> 28:39.759
NARRATOR: <i>But how could you possibly build
an attraction</i>

28:39.843 --> 28:42.262
<i>that would immerse you
deeper than Star Tours?</i>

28:42.345 --> 28:44.055
This was not gonna be,
"We're gonna do a new attraction."

28:44.139 --> 28:45.515
NARRATOR: <i>Then what would you be building?</i>

28:45.598 --> 28:46.891
We're going to build a land.

28:46.975 --> 28:48.768
-NARRATOR: <i>A whole land?</i>
-Yeah.

28:48.852 --> 28:50.311
<i>Technically, two whole lands.</i>

28:50.395 --> 28:54.315
Both at Disneyland
and also at Disney Hollywood Studios.

28:55.191 --> 28:57.026
We built two at the same time.

28:57.110 --> 28:59.654
NARRATOR: <i>Yep. Disney was going all in.</i>

28:59.738 --> 29:02.574
<i>Now, since Star Tours
is already in Tomorrowland,</i>

29:02.657 --> 29:05.201
<i>you know, it only made sense
to put the whole thing there.</i>

29:05.285 --> 29:06.286
Uh-uh.

29:06.369 --> 29:07.287
NARRATOR: <i>"Uh-uh"?</i>

29:07.370 --> 29:09.831
This is not an addition to Tomorrowland.

29:09.914 --> 29:11.499
That's not what Star Wars is about.

29:11.583 --> 29:12.584
NARRATOR: <i>Well, come to think of it,</i>

29:12.667 --> 29:15.003
<i>you can't get much further away
from tomorrow</i>

29:15.086 --> 29:16.421
<i>than a long time ago.</i>

29:16.504 --> 29:19.007
SCOTT: <i>If anything, it's space fantasy.</i>

29:19.090 --> 29:22.594
<i>It has more in common with Frontierland
than it does Tomorrowland.</i>

29:22.677 --> 29:25.722
It really needs to be its own land.

29:25.805 --> 29:26.931
NARRATOR: <i>Well, what kind of land?</i>

29:27.015 --> 29:28.224
Just gotten the property, yes,

29:28.308 --> 29:30.268
there's talk that there's gonna be
a new set of movies,

29:30.351 --> 29:31.853
but nobody knows anything about it.

29:31.936 --> 29:34.397
There was no Episode VII.
There's no script.

29:34.481 --> 29:36.900
NARRATOR: <i>With no choice but to fly blind,</i>

29:36.983 --> 29:39.569
<i>the Imagineers
began intense brainstorming.</i>

29:39.652 --> 29:42.989
You get a group of writers
and designers in the room and engineers.

29:43.072 --> 29:44.949
NARRATOR:
<i>But it wouldn't just be Imagineers...</i>

29:45.033 --> 29:47.035
We were working closely
with the team up at Lucasfilm.

29:47.118 --> 29:48.369
NARRATOR: <i>Just as with Star Tours,</i>

29:48.453 --> 29:51.706
<i>the best and brightest of Lucasfilm
would be along for the ride.</i>

29:51.790 --> 29:53.458
<i>And among them was this guy.</i>

29:53.541 --> 29:54.834
I'm Doug Chiang. I'm the Vice President

29:54.918 --> 29:56.669
and Executive Creative Director
for Lucasfilm.

29:56.753 --> 29:59.255
NARRATOR: <i>Doug was the design director
for The Phantom Menace</i>

29:59.339 --> 30:02.592
<i>and heavily involved
in most of the</i> Star Wars <i>films since.</i>

30:02.675 --> 30:04.177
You know, I provided
the <i>Star Wars</i> designs.

30:04.260 --> 30:08.014
They provided the physical world,
and we will work hand in hand as one team.

30:08.097 --> 30:09.974
NARRATOR: <i>And the objective was clear.</i>

30:10.058 --> 30:13.603
How can we make this experience
authentically <i>Star Wars</i>

30:13.686 --> 30:15.146
and yet fulfilling for the guests?

30:15.230 --> 30:17.857
Based on what we know today,
Episodes I through VI.

30:18.483 --> 30:19.943
That's what we had to work with.

30:20.026 --> 30:22.028
We knew that there will always be Jedi,

30:22.111 --> 30:23.863
<i>there will always be Sith Lords,</i>

30:23.947 --> 30:27.075
<i>droids, ships, aliens and creatures,</i>

30:27.867 --> 30:30.537
because we didn't know
all the details just yet.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.121
We had some ideas, just rough ideas

30:32.205 --> 30:34.999
that we could put up on the board
and start talking about like a Tatooine.

30:35.083 --> 30:37.919
NARRATOR: <i>The team then took
their planetary presentation</i>

30:38.002 --> 30:39.003
<i>to the man in charge.</i>

30:39.087 --> 30:41.214
JOHN: <i>At that point,
we presented it to Bob Iger,</i>

30:41.297 --> 30:42.298
and Bob was like,

30:42.382 --> 30:45.927
"Wow, this is really great stuff, guys,
but these new movies are coming out.

30:46.010 --> 30:47.512
That's what you need to be doing."

30:47.595 --> 30:50.598
NARRATOR: <i>New movies that didn't exist.</i>

30:51.599 --> 30:52.559
<i>Yet.</i>

30:53.643 --> 30:56.646
And it's like,
"Well, okay. Is there a script?"

30:56.729 --> 30:57.772
"Well, it's coming."

30:57.856 --> 30:58.857
NARRATOR: <i>Uh, when?</i>

30:58.940 --> 31:00.316
Good question.

31:00.400 --> 31:03.111
NARRATOR: <i>Well, to finally fill them in
on the upcoming movie,</i>

31:03.194 --> 31:05.780
<i>director JJ Abrams picked up the phone.</i>

31:05.864 --> 31:06.823
How are you?

31:06.906 --> 31:09.284
For, like, an hour,
he pitches the whole film off his iPhone,

31:09.367 --> 31:10.952
and he's, like, flipping
through the storyboards

31:11.035 --> 31:12.245
and the crawl on his phone.

31:12.328 --> 31:13.538
So, he got up and left, and I remember

31:13.621 --> 31:14.873
we all looked at each other
and were like...

31:15.582 --> 31:19.460
NARRATOR: <i>Spoiled for choice,
the Imagineers now could consider Jakku,</i>

31:19.544 --> 31:21.504
<i>Takodana, Hosnian Prime...</i>

31:21.588 --> 31:24.173
<i>Actually, maybe not Hosnian Prime.
Starkiller Base...</i>

31:24.257 --> 31:25.216
I just don't know if there's a planet

31:25.300 --> 31:27.635
that we'd go to that resonates
like a Tatooine.

31:27.719 --> 31:30.847
Whatever we build has to be <i>Star Wars</i>
for everyone.

31:30.930 --> 31:35.018
It can't just be Star Wars
for the 45-year-old fan.

31:35.101 --> 31:38.271
NARRATOR: <i>So after ruling out
all existing Star Wars planets,</i>

31:38.354 --> 31:40.189
<i>something was becoming clear.</i>

31:40.273 --> 31:42.191
Guys, I think it's got to be a place
we've never been.

31:42.275 --> 31:43.693
Maybe you haven't seen it before,

31:43.776 --> 31:44.861
but when you get there,

31:44.944 --> 31:47.155
you would know
this in the Star Wars universe.

31:47.238 --> 31:51.284
And it's not restricted to a vision
that, that they've seen somewhere else.

31:51.367 --> 31:53.828
NARRATOR: <i>All right, then,
but what is this new place?</i>

31:53.912 --> 31:55.663
-Batuu.
-NARRATOR: <i>Oh, gesundheit.</i>

31:55.747 --> 31:56.748
No, the planet Batuu.

31:56.831 --> 31:58.416
-NARRATOR: <i>Ah, that is the place.</i>
-Yeah.

31:58.499 --> 32:00.460
NARRATOR:
<i>So, then, what's the story with Batuu?</i>

32:00.543 --> 32:02.795
Batuu is a remote planet.

32:02.879 --> 32:05.340
ROBIN:
<i>It's kind of where smugglers and villains</i>

32:05.423 --> 32:07.717
and people who want to hide out
end up being.

32:07.800 --> 32:10.637
MARGARET: <i>It's a place that has
its own culture and language.</i>

32:10.720 --> 32:14.557
We wanted to make sure
that we were building an actual place,

32:14.641 --> 32:17.727
an actual planet, an actual town
that you were visiting.

32:18.478 --> 32:21.648
NARRATOR: <i>But it's not just the story
that needed to work from all angles.</i>

32:21.731 --> 32:23.441
The guests aren't going to go
to those two walls,

32:23.524 --> 32:25.610
they're going to go around the corner,
behind the door,

32:25.693 --> 32:27.195
<i>into this other room that's here.</i>

32:27.570 --> 32:30.281
And so we want to make sure
that the illusion of <i>Star Wars</i>

32:30.365 --> 32:31.741
<i>is maintained for all that.</i>

32:31.824 --> 32:33.868
And we did that by basically, you know,
designing it out,

32:33.952 --> 32:36.663
<i>but then we fabricated
a large foamcore model</i>

32:36.746 --> 32:37.830
<i>that was highly detailed,</i>

32:37.914 --> 32:39.415
and we went in with a lipstick camera

32:39.499 --> 32:41.417
<i>to see, "Okay, how are the sightlines?</i>

32:41.501 --> 32:43.670
DOUG: <i>How are you experiencing
these different areas?"</i>

32:43.753 --> 32:45.630
<i>We wanted to make sure
when you were in the park</i>

32:45.713 --> 32:46.714
that you didn't see, suddenly,

32:46.798 --> 32:49.467
a power pole or another skyscraper
that was outside the park.

32:49.550 --> 32:52.679
NARRATOR: <i>But what about
the real-world stuff inside the park?</i>

32:52.762 --> 32:55.682
When we designed the walkways
that we actually had tracks

32:55.765 --> 32:58.184
of, you know, various characters,
and R2-D2 and stuff.

32:58.267 --> 33:01.104
We had the opportunity to go up
to the Skywalker Ranch archives,

33:01.187 --> 33:06.025
get the original Kenny Baker
costume droids from the original movie

33:06.109 --> 33:10.905
and take a rubbing of the feet to put
those exact tracks into the ground.

33:10.989 --> 33:13.366
Those details,
not everybody's going to notice them.

33:13.449 --> 33:16.577
NARRATOR: <i>And you'd be forgiven
for rolling right past this next one too.</i>

33:16.661 --> 33:19.205
We had the Dok-Ondar's Den of Antiquities,

33:19.288 --> 33:22.750
<i>which is one of our stores
that sells all these valuable relics</i>

33:22.834 --> 33:24.252
<i>from around the galaxy.</i>

33:24.335 --> 33:27.714
And, when you first enter,
there was this wall,

33:27.797 --> 33:30.508
and we didn't know what to hang up on it.

33:30.591 --> 33:34.470
MARGARET: <i>And in Revenge of the Sith,
there was this bas relief</i>

33:34.846 --> 33:39.225
<i>and it depicted this great battle
between the Light side and the Dark side.</i>

33:39.308 --> 33:44.147
So, we made a smaller version of that
as if Dok-Ondar had acquired for his den.

33:44.230 --> 33:45.356
NARRATOR: <i>That's a relief.</i>

33:45.440 --> 33:47.817
There are many of those things
that are built throughout the land

33:47.900 --> 33:50.695
<i>for the reason that we want the guests
to self-discover these things</i>

33:50.778 --> 33:53.489
<i>and kind of see all the,
the homework that we did for it.</i>

33:53.573 --> 33:55.908
NARRATOR: <i>With the Imagineers obsessing
over details,</i>

33:55.992 --> 33:58.786
<i>it was clear they had set the bar high.</i>

33:58.870 --> 34:00.538
<i>Now, speaking of bars...</i>

34:02.915 --> 34:06.502
Every self-respecting outpost
is going to have a cantina.

34:06.586 --> 34:09.255
ROBIN: <i>I mean, you know,
where else would people go?</i>

34:09.338 --> 34:12.341
NARRATOR:
<i>And like every self-respecting cantina...</i>

34:12.425 --> 34:13.926
We don't serve their kind here.

34:14.010 --> 34:17.430
Droids are not really welcome
in the cantina.

34:17.513 --> 34:19.098
NARRATOR: <i>Well, except one...</i>

34:19.182 --> 34:20.183
<i>Hi there!</i>

34:20.266 --> 34:22.268
NARRATOR: <i>...who appears
to have been brought back online.</i>

34:24.187 --> 34:25.730
ROBIN: <i>Rex is the DJ.</i>

34:26.189 --> 34:28.191
And for those who are fans of Star Tours,

34:28.274 --> 34:29.692
you might remember
that he wasn't a great pilot.

34:29.776 --> 34:31.069
<i>Where are the brakes?</i>

34:31.152 --> 34:32.111
And...

34:33.279 --> 34:34.781
he's not a great DJ either.

34:34.864 --> 34:37.283
NARRATOR: <i>But there's more
to Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge</i>

34:37.366 --> 34:39.494
<i>than just intergalactic beverages.</i>

34:39.577 --> 34:41.287
<i>A lot more! Because...</i>

34:41.370 --> 34:43.956
The number one thing that our fans said

34:44.040 --> 34:46.584
that they wanted to do
was have the opportunity to...

34:46.667 --> 34:47.960
Bypass the compressor.

34:48.044 --> 34:51.464
NARRATOR: <i>No, it wasn't that.
It was overwhelmingly and resoundingly...</i>

34:51.547 --> 34:52.840
Fly the Millennium Falcon.

34:52.924 --> 34:56.928
It's such an unbelievably iconic ship

34:57.011 --> 35:00.807
and, in many ways, certainly,
we think of it as a character.

35:00.890 --> 35:02.809
NARRATOR: <i>Well, whatever this ship
means to you,</i>

35:02.892 --> 35:05.728
<i>the</i> Millennium Falcon <i>is unquestionably...</i>

35:05.812 --> 35:07.105
One of the most beautiful designs.

35:07.188 --> 35:09.107
NARRATOR: <i>...and the single
most important ship</i>

35:09.190 --> 35:10.399
<i>in the galaxy's welfare.</i>

35:10.483 --> 35:11.901
Yeehaw!

35:11.984 --> 35:12.944
(chuckles)

35:13.027 --> 35:15.947
NARRATOR: <i>And at the heart
of this immersive experience,</i>

35:16.030 --> 35:17.907
<i>a simulator attraction that takes</i>

35:17.990 --> 35:21.410
<i>what was achieved
with Star Tours to the whole next level.</i>

35:21.494 --> 35:23.204
We knew we needed to put you in control.

35:23.287 --> 35:25.289
(whoops, laughs)

35:25.373 --> 35:27.959
You get to be the one that gets
to crew the ship,

35:28.042 --> 35:31.879
to fire the laser blasters,
to be the one to work furiously

35:31.963 --> 35:34.173
to try to keep the bucket
of bolts in working order.

35:35.133 --> 35:38.386
NARRATOR: <i>An idea so exciting,
so ground-breaking...</i>

35:38.469 --> 35:41.305
It was a natural fit
for a motion simulator technology.

35:41.389 --> 35:43.474
NARRATOR: <i>...it almost seemed
too good to be true.</i>

35:43.558 --> 35:44.517
Wait a minute.

35:44.600 --> 35:47.436
There's only one Millennium Falcon.
There's only one cockpit.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.355
SCOTT: <i>There's, like, six seats
in that cockpit.</i>

35:49.438 --> 35:51.649
Oh, my gosh. The line for this, you know,
it's like, you're going to be able

35:51.732 --> 35:53.401
to only get, like, a hundred people a day.

35:53.484 --> 35:54.360
Um...

35:54.443 --> 35:55.778
NARRATOR:
<i>And the more they looked into it...</i>

35:55.862 --> 35:59.365
Designing something that
a whole lot of people can ride in an hour?

35:59.448 --> 36:00.491
Very, very hard.

36:00.575 --> 36:02.743
-NARRATOR: <i>...the bigger the issues?</i>
-Uh...

36:02.827 --> 36:04.620
How do we make this happen?
How do we make this happen?

36:04.704 --> 36:06.330
How do we make this happen at scale?

36:06.414 --> 36:08.416
NARRATOR:
<i>As the Imagineers' heads were spinning...</i>

36:08.499 --> 36:10.001
How do we make this happen?
How do we make this happen?

36:10.084 --> 36:13.004
NARRATOR: <i>...a solution emerged
from a long time ago</i>

36:13.087 --> 36:14.922
<i>in an attraction far, far away.</i>

36:15.006 --> 36:18.509
ANNOUNCER 2: <i>Welcome
to Walt Disney's Carousel of Progress.</i>

36:18.593 --> 36:20.261
NARRATOR: <i>The Carousel of Progress was...</i>

36:20.344 --> 36:24.557
A theater in which the audience itself
moves in their seats around the stages.

36:24.640 --> 36:25.850
Such a simple system.

36:25.933 --> 36:28.269
It's just a circular track
that goes click, click, click.

36:28.352 --> 36:30.980
NARRATOR: <i>They'd found a way to create
a unique experience</i>

36:31.063 --> 36:32.773
<i>for every single guest.</i>

36:32.857 --> 36:36.277
And when you cross that threshold
into the cockpit of the Falcon,

36:36.360 --> 36:39.530
you're actually walking
into the Carousel of Progress,

36:39.614 --> 36:40.531
so to speak.

36:40.615 --> 36:42.033
JOHN: <i>But you don't realize
is there's really</i>

36:42.116 --> 36:44.577
<i>5 other pie wedges of theaters</i>

36:44.660 --> 36:47.205
<i>that are watching different scenes
of this same show</i>

36:47.288 --> 36:48.873
<i>at the same time as you load into it.</i>

36:48.956 --> 36:52.460
And doors close, you go on your ride,
and you have your whole experience.

36:52.543 --> 36:55.630
<i>Meanwhile, click, the next pod
comes in, the next people get in.</i>

36:55.713 --> 36:58.841
The magic of it is that when you get off,
there's no one trying to get on.

36:58.925 --> 37:01.135
You truly feel like we're the
only ones getting on it,

37:01.219 --> 37:03.054
<i>and we're the only ones getting off,
it was our ship.</i>

37:03.137 --> 37:05.056
NARRATOR: <i>Your own ship.
You hear that, Chris?</i>

37:05.139 --> 37:07.516
Have the Millennium Falcon now.
It's just full-size.

37:08.142 --> 37:10.394
NARRATOR: <i>And you didn't even have
to put the decals on it.</i>

37:10.478 --> 37:12.396
<i>So they had Imagineered their way</i>

37:12.480 --> 37:15.233
<i>to a workable solution
for high guest turnover.</i>

37:15.316 --> 37:17.276
<i>But for their next issue...</i>

37:17.360 --> 37:19.987
This is an experience
that's all about flying in a spaceship.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.572
ASA: <i>You need to be able to see, you know,</i>

37:21.656 --> 37:24.742
fantastical imagery
through that cockpit window, obviously.

37:24.825 --> 37:27.453
NARRATOR:
<i>Obviously, just like Star Tours, but...</i>

37:27.536 --> 37:30.873
The fact that we were giving people
the ability to control the ship

37:30.957 --> 37:32.875
<i>meant that this couldn't be a film either.</i>

37:32.959 --> 37:34.877
ASA: <i>It meant that this would have
to be something</i>

37:34.961 --> 37:36.629
that was being created in real time,

37:36.712 --> 37:39.799
being rendered on the fly
based on what people were doing.

37:39.882 --> 37:42.760
NARRATOR: <i>And while that may sound
a lot like a video game...</i>

37:42.843 --> 37:47.014
Well, it leverages technology
that is used in the video game industry.

37:47.098 --> 37:50.184
NARRATOR: <i>...this attraction
was a game-changer because...</i>

37:50.268 --> 37:51.519
The technology that we needed

37:51.602 --> 37:53.813
in order to deliver
Millennium Falcon: Smuggler's Run

37:53.896 --> 37:56.440
absolutely did not exist in 2015.

37:56.524 --> 37:58.067
-NARRATOR: <i>Definitely a problem.</i>
-Huh.

37:58.401 --> 38:01.112
ASA: <i>The game engines that existed</i>

38:01.195 --> 38:05.199
<i>were not capable of delivering
the pixels we needed</i>

38:05.283 --> 38:06.701
<i>at the frame rate we needed.</i>

38:06.784 --> 38:09.870
So, for many, many years of the project,

38:10.288 --> 38:13.332
when we were in
our mock-up projection dome,

38:13.416 --> 38:15.876
<i>there would be days when we were looking
at imagery that was...</i>

38:16.460 --> 38:18.170
<i>one to two frames per second.</i>

38:19.046 --> 38:21.632
It caused us to have to really have trust

38:21.716 --> 38:24.552
that those engineers
would be able to find a way

38:24.635 --> 38:25.761
to fine-tune that engine,

38:25.845 --> 38:27.680
to get the performance
out of it that we needed.

38:27.763 --> 38:30.266
NARRATOR: <i>Luckily,
the software engineering caught up</i>

38:30.349 --> 38:31.934
<i>with the theme park Imagineering.</i>

38:32.018 --> 38:35.896
So, it really wasn't until maybe
the final 6 months of the project

38:35.980 --> 38:39.025
that we were ever able
to actually sit in that cockpit,

38:39.108 --> 38:42.153
fly through the experience
the way that our guests would.

38:42.236 --> 38:44.989
NARRATOR: <i>And what an experience
they were in store for.</i>

38:45.072 --> 38:49.368
CROWD: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

38:49.452 --> 38:51.579
(cheering)

38:51.662 --> 38:53.831
NARRATOR: <i>Because in May of 2019,</i>

38:53.914 --> 38:58.169
<i>Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge
made its grand opening to the public.</i>

38:58.252 --> 39:00.713
Our biggest fans have dreamt
about being a part of this world

39:00.796 --> 39:02.548
for more than 40 years.

39:02.631 --> 39:05.176
NARRATOR: <i>But Galaxy's Edge
was just getting started.</i>

39:05.259 --> 39:08.888
We, as a company, are still advancing
all of the systems that we use.

39:08.971 --> 39:11.599
NARRATOR: <i>In late 2019,
at Walt Disney World,</i>

39:11.682 --> 39:14.185
<i>and early 2020 at Disneyland,</i>

39:14.268 --> 39:17.355
<i>an attraction so advanced
opened in Galaxy's Edge.</i>

39:17.438 --> 39:20.107
<i>It really needs to be seen to be believed.</i>

39:20.191 --> 39:24.028
Rise of the Resistance is 360 immersion.

39:24.111 --> 39:25.696
There are no hat tricks.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.281
ASYA: <i>You can see everywhere.</i>

39:27.365 --> 39:29.241
There's the Resistance ship,
it's out there.

39:29.325 --> 39:32.244
JOHN: <i>And you actually walk
into this huge 70-foot ship.</i>

39:32.328 --> 39:34.538
<i>Those doors close,
you take off from the planet,</i>

39:34.622 --> 39:35.581
<i>and then you're immediately</i>

39:35.664 --> 39:38.042
<i>getting tractor
beamed into a Star Destroyer.</i>

39:38.125 --> 39:40.211
<i>And when those doors re-open,</i>

39:40.294 --> 39:43.255
<i>you're now
in that Star Destroyer hangar bay.</i>

39:43.339 --> 39:45.716
That's epic.
That's like living the adventure, right?

39:45.800 --> 39:48.052
It's part ride, part role-play.

39:48.135 --> 39:50.471
It's so epic,
I need a ride to get to the ride.

39:50.554 --> 39:55.017
NARRATOR: <i>And once you ride to the ride,
the ride that you'll ride is this ride.</i>

39:55.101 --> 39:58.687
It is an 8-seater troop transport
for the First Order.

39:58.771 --> 40:01.232
ASYA: <i>It has an onboard astromech unit.</i>

40:01.315 --> 40:04.443
<i>It's an R5-J2
for our major fans out there.</i>

40:04.527 --> 40:05.903
Which is important to me

40:05.986 --> 40:09.031
because George Lucas
described Episodes IV through VI

40:09.115 --> 40:11.951
as a period piece told
from the perspective of droids.

40:12.034 --> 40:13.702
(beeping)

40:13.786 --> 40:15.246
<i>Yes, R2. I was just coming to that.</i>

40:15.329 --> 40:17.456
ASYA: <i>And so, the fact that that droid
is your narrator,</i>

40:17.540 --> 40:21.085
just like every <i>Star Wars </i>story,
is what makes it so authentic to me.

40:21.168 --> 40:24.547
NARRATOR: <i>And while Rise of the Resistance
is quite authentic,</i>

40:24.630 --> 40:26.799
<i>right down to the
stormtroopers' betaplast armor,</i>

40:26.882 --> 40:32.930
<i>it's also the culmination of over 60 years
of Disney Parks innovation and technology.</i>

40:33.013 --> 40:36.100
There's so much of our DNA as a company
that we've put into this

40:36.183 --> 40:39.937
<i>and crammed together
into this one amazing experience.</i>

40:40.020 --> 40:43.190
PAUL: <i>These are the building blocks
that the future is based on,</i>

40:43.482 --> 40:45.734
all of the attractions from here on out.

40:47.069 --> 40:49.780
NARRATOR: <i>What the Imagineers achieved
with Galaxy's Edge</i>

40:49.864 --> 40:53.242
<i>and even still to this day
with Star Tours...</i>

40:53.325 --> 40:56.745
As the films come out,
it's been updated along the way.

40:56.829 --> 40:59.415
NARRATOR: <i>...is truly revolutionary.
However...</i>

40:59.498 --> 41:01.792
It is really what Walt, I think, you know,

41:01.876 --> 41:04.628
what he was trying to do in Disneyland
and putting you into the story.

41:04.712 --> 41:07.673
REPORTER 4:
<i>For Disneyland will never be completed.</i>

41:07.756 --> 41:12.678
That is actually very much in the DNA
of going back to Walt Disney himself.

41:12.761 --> 41:15.055
WALT DISNEY: <i>It will be unlike
anything else on this earth.</i>

41:15.139 --> 41:17.725
The concept of immersion into a story

41:18.184 --> 41:21.604
<i>was what Walt set out to do
with Disneyland.</i>

41:21.687 --> 41:25.024
I remember going to Disneyland
and going on the Jungle Cruise,

41:25.107 --> 41:26.442
<i>and that was real.</i>

41:26.525 --> 41:30.196
ROBIN: <i>That was the most, that was
the most immersive three-dimensional thing</i>

41:30.279 --> 41:31.238
<i>that you'd ever done.</i>

41:31.322 --> 41:33.199
NARRATOR:
<i>From Disneyland's very first day,</i>

41:33.282 --> 41:37.620
<i>and its second day
when a young lad visited the park...</i>

41:37.703 --> 41:38.871
I was there the second day it opened.

41:38.954 --> 41:41.081
NARRATOR:
<i>...and set into motion a relationship</i>

41:41.165 --> 41:43.876
<i>that seemed to be forged in the stars.</i>

41:43.959 --> 41:46.712
YOUNG TONY: <i>This marriage of Disneyland
with Star Wars,</i>

41:46.795 --> 41:48.297
you really can't compare it
to anything else.

41:48.380 --> 41:51.842
I think Walt and George
are probably fairly similar.

41:51.926 --> 41:53.928
DENNIS: <i>They very much know
what the public wants,</i>

41:54.011 --> 41:55.471
<i>which is what they want.</i>

41:56.388 --> 41:58.307
-We created a new...
-A new kind of technology.

41:59.141 --> 42:00.309
They're brilliant.

42:00.392 --> 42:02.102
(screaming)

42:02.186 --> 42:06.065
NARRATOR: <i>From the brilliance
of George Lucas and Walt Disney</i>

42:06.148 --> 42:07.983
<i>to those who followed their lead</i>

42:08.067 --> 42:10.486
<i>and brought Star Wars
from the big screen...</i>

42:10.569 --> 42:12.321
Stay in attack formation!

42:12.404 --> 42:14.031
NARRATOR: <i>...to the simulator screen...</i>

42:14.114 --> 42:18.369
Tony and Tom
are two incredibly talented Imagineers.

42:18.452 --> 42:20.538
Star Tours was how we could,

42:20.621 --> 42:24.583
as Imagineers,
bring <i>Star Wars</i> to life back in the '80s.

42:25.334 --> 42:26.919
It made us proud because...

42:27.002 --> 42:30.130
It's really, actually,
blown everyone away.

42:30.214 --> 42:33.175
People are still walking through that door
and having goose bumps.

42:33.259 --> 42:34.760
(screaming)

42:34.843 --> 42:36.929
But, wow, when you step
into Galaxy's Edge,

42:37.012 --> 42:39.348
you are truly in the story.

42:39.431 --> 42:43.435
NARRATOR: <i>And for the Imagineers
who walked in Tom and Tony's footsteps,</i>

42:43.519 --> 42:44.687
<i>or droid tracks...</i>

42:44.770 --> 42:46.689
We created this together.

42:46.772 --> 42:50.192
NARRATOR: <i>...they brought Star Wars
not just off the big screen...</i>

42:50.276 --> 42:51.485
(groans)

42:51.569 --> 42:53.946
<i>...but into the big, wide world.</i>

42:54.029 --> 42:55.489
DOUG: Star Wars <i>never gets old for me</i>

42:55.573 --> 42:57.908
and it always takes me back
to when I was 15 years old.

42:58.409 --> 43:01.412
<i>I grew up in Michigan in the suburbs,
and I was in the bookstore one day,</i>

43:01.495 --> 43:02.913
<i>and this painting by Ralph McQuarrie</i>

43:02.997 --> 43:05.249
<i>of the X-wing flying down
the Death Star trench</i>

43:05.332 --> 43:07.126
<i>just completely blew me away,</i>

43:07.209 --> 43:09.336
that I realized
that's what I wanted to do.

43:09.420 --> 43:11.714
<i>I wanted to learn how to do that.</i>

43:11.797 --> 43:14.091
<i>And that's what the magic
of Batuu is for me,</i>

43:14.174 --> 43:17.303
<i>is that even though I know all
the heartaches that build what we build,</i>

43:17.386 --> 43:19.638
but when I get there,
I can forget all that

43:19.722 --> 43:21.765
and I can experience it
like when I was 15 years old.

43:22.891 --> 43:24.435
CHRIS: <i>I feel like we really did pay off</i>

43:24.518 --> 43:27.938
that childhood dream of getting to step
into this incredible world,

43:28.022 --> 43:30.691
<i>and I have a place in this, in this world.</i>

43:32.109 --> 43:33.360
NARRATOR: <i>A world of villains...</i>

43:33.444 --> 43:35.154
Move along, move along.

43:35.237 --> 43:36.655
<i>-...rogues...</i>
-(mumbles)

43:36.739 --> 43:38.032
<i>...and heroes,</i>

43:38.574 --> 43:41.619
<i>but most of all, imagination...</i>

43:41.702 --> 43:42.911
(screaming)

43:42.995 --> 43:44.371
<i>...and adventure.</i>

43:44.455 --> 43:46.874
If you've ever dreamed
of being an X-wing fighter pilot

43:46.957 --> 43:49.335
<i>or dreamed of being
in the</i> Star Wars <i>films,</i>

43:49.418 --> 43:50.586
<i>now is your chance.</i>

43:53.797 --> 43:57.301
Wow, that was incredible.
Let's get in line again.

43:58.177 --> 44:00.721
<i>Good night, and may the Force be with...</i>

44:01.889 --> 44:03.891
(upbeat music)
