00:28.706 --> 00:30.165
Man: Oh, hey, Bubs.

00:30.207 --> 00:31.917
Oh, hey, boys,
what's going on?

00:31.958 --> 00:34.336
Man:
Well, we heard you were
going to be in a ninja movie.

00:34.378 --> 00:36.672
Well, it's not official yet,

00:36.714 --> 00:39.508
but Verne Troyer,
you know, Verne Troyer, Mini-Me?

00:39.550 --> 00:42.010
He's making a movie
called "Micro Ninja".

00:42.052 --> 00:43.679
There was a contest
on the Internet.

00:43.721 --> 00:45.222
You could submit a video

00:45.264 --> 00:47.182
explaining why you think
you should be in the movie.

00:47.224 --> 00:48.892
I fucking sent one in.

00:52.062 --> 00:53.188
Hi, there.

00:53.230 --> 00:54.690
My name's Bubbles.

00:54.732 --> 00:57.526
From the Sunnyvale trailer park,
Nova Scotia, Canada.

00:57.568 --> 00:59.528
I grew up here, my whole life,

00:59.570 --> 01:01.822
between my friends
Ricky and Julian.

01:01.905 --> 01:03.365
I live in that shed right there

01:03.407 --> 01:06.201
and I'm applying
to be in your ninja movie.

01:06.243 --> 01:09.538
I've seen...
every ninja movie in history

01:09.580 --> 01:11.873
and I'm pretty
fucking good with these.

01:11.915 --> 01:13.542
I know you know what those are.

01:13.584 --> 01:15.877
I can...
(Imitating swooshes)

01:15.919 --> 01:17.212
Pretty good with those.

01:17.254 --> 01:19.381
And I mean I can do
all the other moves.

01:19.423 --> 01:21.717
You know, back flips and kicks,

01:21.759 --> 01:24.720
and scissor kicks,
all the kicks.

01:24.762 --> 01:26.388
I can do them all.

01:26.430 --> 01:28.390
Put me in that movie,

01:28.432 --> 01:30.225
I'd appreciate it.

01:30.267 --> 01:31.727
(Sniggers)

01:31.769 --> 01:34.229
Apparently the producers
were very fucking impressed

01:34.271 --> 01:35.564
because I got a call-back.

01:35.606 --> 01:37.232
They wanted to see, you know,

01:37.274 --> 01:38.567
how I could do at acting.

01:38.609 --> 01:41.236
So I shot a fucking
unbelievable demo.

01:41.278 --> 01:43.238
J-Roc's adding music
to it right now.

01:43.280 --> 01:44.865
I'm going to head back
to the park and meet him

01:44.906 --> 01:47.242
and get my bags packed, because
I'm going to hand-deliver

01:47.284 --> 01:49.202
the fucking thing
to Austin, Texas,

01:49.244 --> 01:50.912
where they're shooting
the movie.

01:50.954 --> 01:52.414
That's how I show Verne Troyer

01:52.456 --> 01:54.875
that I am not
fucking around here!

01:57.628 --> 01:59.880
You gotta get
on the turkey-bacon
tip, dawg.

01:59.921 --> 02:02.257
It's better
for your arteries
and all that.

02:02.299 --> 02:03.884
You know'm sayin'?
Yeah, yeah, I hear you.

02:03.925 --> 02:05.469
That shit's
can get hard up
in your arteries

02:05.511 --> 02:06.887
if you eatin'
that real shit.
I just...

02:06.928 --> 02:08.555
I just stick
to what I know.

02:08.597 --> 02:10.264
Wit' yo' applewood
smokeness.
Yo, B, you in them?

02:10.306 --> 02:11.433
Bubbles:
Come in!

02:11.475 --> 02:12.852
Wassup?
Wassup, hah?

02:12.893 --> 02:14.394
Just packing for the trip.
You got 'er?

02:14.436 --> 02:16.104
Got it, man.
It's all good.

02:16.146 --> 02:17.898
Holy fuck, look at that!
All labelled up!

02:17.939 --> 02:21.443
That is fucking awesome, boys.
What did you think?

02:21.485 --> 02:23.111
Of what?
I...
Of this.

02:23.153 --> 02:26.448
I mean, I thought
it was pretty
fucking awesome myself

02:26.490 --> 02:28.784
and I can only
imagine now that
it's even more awesome!

02:28.826 --> 02:30.619
Man, I ain't even
had a chance
to check it out.

02:30.661 --> 02:32.954
I was making bacon
with my candy.

02:32.996 --> 02:34.498
You didn't see it?
No.

02:34.540 --> 02:35.957
You never had
his candy bacon?

02:35.999 --> 02:38.794
Oh, I've had your bacon,
it's fucking... tight,

02:38.836 --> 02:41.922
but... what did
you think of it?
The demo, I mean, like...

02:41.963 --> 02:44.299
Two reasons
I didn't really get
to see it, dawg.

02:44.341 --> 02:46.802
One is, I was eating
my bacon, that he made,

02:46.844 --> 02:48.929
and the second is,
I had my head down,
I was like Lobster-Boy,

02:48.970 --> 02:51.306
you know'm saying,
like bring...
So you didn't even watch it?

02:51.348 --> 02:52.974
...the music up,
sneaky vocals
underneath.

02:53.016 --> 02:54.935
My ears thought
it looked tight.

02:54.976 --> 02:57.813
Okay, well that's good because,
if your ears thought
it looked good,

02:57.855 --> 03:00.148
when your lookers
actually see it,
they might...

03:00.190 --> 03:02.526
Exactly, it sounds good.
I think that's
a good indication.

03:02.568 --> 03:04.945
That's all I need to know.
Your eyes'll think
it sounds good, sayin'?

03:06.196 --> 03:07.656
Awesome!
Good luck, dawg.

03:07.698 --> 03:08.949
Thanks, boys.

03:08.990 --> 03:10.659
Pay your invoice
within 30 days,
though, sayin'?

03:10.701 --> 03:13.328
Did you, uh...
make that bacon?

03:13.370 --> 03:15.121
Yeah, I got more
back at the crib.

03:15.163 --> 03:18.667
Maybe I'll come by
before I go and get
a bacon sandwich.

03:18.709 --> 03:20.502
Sounds good.
White or whole wheat?

03:20.544 --> 03:21.962
Doesn't matter.
Better hurry,

03:22.003 --> 03:24.172
because the bacon
won't be there long, hah!

03:24.214 --> 03:25.507
All right.

03:32.472 --> 03:36.977
(Dark synth music)

03:37.018 --> 03:39.479
(Imitating the Terminator)
"I'll be back".

03:41.565 --> 03:42.983
You know what they call

03:43.024 --> 03:45.861
a Quarter Pounder
with Cheese in Paris?

03:45.903 --> 03:47.863
They don't call it
a Quarter Pounder?

03:47.905 --> 03:49.823
No, man, they got
the metric system.

03:49.865 --> 03:52.200
They wouldn't know
what the fuck a
Quarter Pounder is.

03:52.242 --> 03:54.202
What do they call it, then?

03:54.244 --> 03:56.371
A Royale with Cheese.

03:56.413 --> 03:59.541
(Giggles)
"Royale with Cheese".

03:59.583 --> 04:01.126
What do they call a Big Mac?

04:01.167 --> 04:04.546
A Big Mac's a Big Mac
but they call it "Le Big Mac".

04:04.588 --> 04:07.424
(Giggling)
"Le Big Mac".

04:07.466 --> 04:09.551
What about the Whopper?

04:09.593 --> 04:11.637
I don't know. I didn't go
into Burger King.

04:15.265 --> 04:16.558
You talking to me?

04:18.601 --> 04:19.894
You talking to me?

04:22.272 --> 04:23.565
Talking to me?

04:25.442 --> 04:26.902
Well who the hell else
would you be...

04:26.944 --> 04:28.069
You talking to me?

04:29.780 --> 04:33.909
Well, I'm the only one here.

04:33.951 --> 04:36.536
The fuck do you think
you're talking to?

04:38.121 --> 04:41.082
Oh, yeah? Hm?

04:41.124 --> 04:42.459
Okay.

04:44.628 --> 04:45.754
Huh?

04:51.969 --> 04:55.096
(Imitating Karl)
"It ain't got no gas in it".

04:55.138 --> 04:57.098
Holy fuck!

04:57.140 --> 04:58.600
Unbelievable!

04:58.642 --> 05:00.101
Unbelievable.
Did you see that?

05:00.143 --> 05:02.771
I can't believe
that I did that.

05:02.813 --> 05:06.775
Like that, to me, looked just
like the fucking real movies.

05:06.817 --> 05:09.945
Going to hand-deliver it,
Julian promised
he'd get me there

05:09.987 --> 05:11.154
down to Austin.

05:11.196 --> 05:12.614
He's set up kind of a live show

05:12.656 --> 05:14.616
that's going to cover
all the cost

05:14.658 --> 05:16.618
of getting us there and me
and Ricky and Julian are going

05:16.660 --> 05:17.953
if I can get Ricky to come.

05:17.995 --> 05:20.246
He's been acting
pretty weird lately.

05:20.288 --> 05:23.124
He says he's got
an idea that's going
to change the world!

05:23.166 --> 05:25.085
(Cackles)

05:25.126 --> 05:27.379
I don't have time
to go away with Bubbles
and Julian, right now!

05:27.420 --> 05:28.881
I'm going to be retired
in less than a year.

05:28.922 --> 05:30.757
But in order to do that,
I got to get more drunker

05:30.799 --> 05:32.926
and more higher than I've been
in a long fucking time,

05:32.968 --> 05:35.054
take everything that's
in here and put it
into a fucking book.

05:35.095 --> 05:37.597
It won't be a book 'cause
one of the hard floppy
things on the outside,

05:37.639 --> 05:40.642
but it'll be more like a
bookel like you get at church
or at the fucking circus.

05:40.684 --> 05:42.519
Anyway, that's why
I'm collecting cans and bottles,

05:42.561 --> 05:44.229
getting money to get
drunk and high.

05:44.270 --> 05:46.815
Julian thinks it's dumb
but it's easy fucking money.

05:46.857 --> 05:48.984
(Sighing)
But it is taking forever,

05:49.026 --> 05:51.653
so I guess we're going
to have to take it up
a notch, aren't we?

05:51.695 --> 05:54.197
(Engine knocking)

06:03.707 --> 06:05.166
Well, that's how
you fucking do that.

06:05.208 --> 06:07.252
Julian wouldn't help me,
so I said, "Fuck it!"

06:07.293 --> 06:10.130
Get my brain going:
"Where am I going to find
the most cans for little work?"

06:10.171 --> 06:12.549
So I went to down
the recycling depot and
robbed the fucking place.

06:12.591 --> 06:14.175
It's awesome!

06:14.217 --> 06:16.845
There's got to be
40, 50 bucks.
Holy fuck, Ricky!

06:16.887 --> 06:19.014
You hit the jackpot!
I know!

06:19.056 --> 06:20.682
Where'd you get them?

06:20.724 --> 06:22.392
Err... down
by the mall.

06:22.434 --> 06:24.477
Must've been a lot
of people partying
this weekend.

06:24.519 --> 06:26.187
Fuck, those
are some beauts!
I know.

06:26.229 --> 06:28.023
Yeah. Now I've got
enough money to
fucking get drunk

06:28.065 --> 06:29.858
and high as fuck,
4 or 5 days, finish off my
little project

06:29.900 --> 06:31.860
and get retired.
I know, Ricky,

06:31.902 --> 06:34.195
but couldn't that wait
a couple of days?

06:34.237 --> 06:35.864
Can't you come
to Austin?

06:35.906 --> 06:38.533
Julian said it's
all set and we are
going to get paid.

06:38.575 --> 06:40.201
Please?
I don't know, Bubs.

06:40.243 --> 06:41.870
With you guys gone
I'll have nothing
to distract me

06:41.912 --> 06:43.413
and I'll get this
fucking thing finished.

06:43.455 --> 06:45.206
I need to get
retired quick, man.
I know,

06:45.248 --> 06:46.625
but it's not the same.

06:46.666 --> 06:48.209
I don't want to just go
down there with Julian.

06:48.251 --> 06:50.211
I don't really want
to go down with
Julian and <i> Randy!</i>

06:50.253 --> 06:52.047
Like fuck!
Are they dating now?

06:52.089 --> 06:54.174
Holy shit, man!
That didn't take you long.
Yeah, no kidding.

06:54.215 --> 06:56.718
What did you do? Fucking
rob the recycling depot
or something?

06:56.760 --> 06:59.179
Yeah. That's exactly
what I did, actually.

06:59.220 --> 07:01.347
You just told me
you got them down
by the mall!

07:01.389 --> 07:04.059
Well, I meant the
recycling depot
by the mall.

07:04.101 --> 07:06.227
And you robbed
the place?
Well...

07:06.269 --> 07:07.437
borrowed
some stuff, yeah.

07:07.479 --> 07:08.939
Well, have fun
cashing them in, bud.

07:08.981 --> 07:10.523
I'll take them
to the other one
across town,

07:10.565 --> 07:12.358
they won't know.
Yeah? Do you
want a hand?

07:12.400 --> 07:15.403
Huh! Oh, you want
to help me now
it's cashing in time?

07:15.445 --> 07:16.905
No, I'm good.

07:16.947 --> 07:18.115
Fuck you, then.

07:18.157 --> 07:19.449
Boys, stop fighting.

07:19.491 --> 07:22.243
Listen, demo is done.

07:22.285 --> 07:23.453
Nice.
She's done.

07:23.495 --> 07:24.788
Will you guys come
and watch it?

07:24.830 --> 07:26.247
I'm really fucking
excited about it.

07:26.289 --> 07:27.707
Yeah, I got
a couple of minutes.
Let's do it.

07:27.749 --> 07:28.959
Okay, I'll get it...
Is it good?

07:29.001 --> 07:30.710
I'll get it...
is it good?
Yeah.

07:30.752 --> 07:33.088
Did you just say that?
I'm just
asking you, man.

07:33.130 --> 07:34.756
Bubbles:
Ha-ha! You fucking
wait, baby!

07:34.798 --> 07:36.424
How was your little
date with Randy?

07:36.466 --> 07:37.759
Look, you know what?

07:37.801 --> 07:39.094
If you're saying that
to bother me,

07:39.136 --> 07:40.804
it's not fucking working,
all right?

07:40.846 --> 07:42.931
Ricky's driving me
fucking nuts with
this Randy shit.

07:42.973 --> 07:45.100
And I don't get it.
I mean, I'm ripping
Randy off every day.

07:45.142 --> 07:46.601
You know, I'm working out
with him for 10 minutes,

07:46.643 --> 07:49.104
get paid 50 bucks.
Woop-di-shit!

07:49.146 --> 07:51.606
It doesn't mean
I'm fucking going out
with him or anything.

07:51.648 --> 07:52.983
It's stupid!

07:53.025 --> 07:54.526
What's you and
your boyfriend
doing tonight?

07:54.567 --> 07:56.028
Going out for dinner
or anything?

07:56.069 --> 07:57.946
Won't you shut
the fuck up.
I'm working tonight.

07:57.988 --> 08:00.115
Come on, Bubs!
I got shit
to do. Let's go!

08:00.157 --> 08:01.574
Just wait here.

08:01.616 --> 08:03.618
I've got it. I just
want it to be perfect.

08:03.660 --> 08:04.953
Just cueing her up.

08:04.995 --> 08:06.621
Okay, are you ready?
Let's do it.

08:06.663 --> 08:08.456
Just wait now
before I roll it.

08:08.498 --> 08:10.625
It turned out a lot better
than I thought it would, boys.

08:10.667 --> 08:12.127
Right on.
Nice.
(Sniggers)

08:12.169 --> 08:14.254
I think I could actually
fucking get this part

08:14.295 --> 08:15.964
and maybe some other parts
and I could start

08:16.006 --> 08:17.465
making millions of dollars.

08:17.507 --> 08:18.967
Millions?
I could.

08:19.009 --> 08:20.635
I mean, I think
it's that good.

08:20.677 --> 08:22.804
But, if I do, you guys
got to promise me,

08:22.846 --> 08:24.973
I'm in control of the money.

08:25.015 --> 08:26.432
It's your money, man.
Promise me!

08:26.474 --> 08:27.809
I promise.
It's your fucking money.

08:27.851 --> 08:29.186
I'm not going
to touch it.

08:29.228 --> 08:30.812
Holy fuck! The partying
we'll be doing

08:30.854 --> 08:32.813
if you make millions.
That'd be wicked.

08:32.856 --> 08:34.649
We got to talk
about that, too, Ricky.

08:34.691 --> 08:36.985
Here, let's maybe not
get ahead of ourselves.

08:37.027 --> 08:40.613
All right? Okay,
check it out, here we go.

08:43.323 --> 08:46.494
It's good, man!
It's "Terminator".

08:46.536 --> 08:47.829
Is that T?

08:47.871 --> 08:49.831
Oh, my fuck!
You look fucked, man!

08:49.873 --> 08:51.291
This is wicked!

08:51.332 --> 08:53.668
(Chuckling)

08:53.710 --> 08:57.047
<i>You talking to me? </i>
(Laughing)

08:57.089 --> 08:59.174
<i>...the fuck do you think
you're talking to?</i>

08:59.216 --> 09:03.845
It's "Taxi Driver"!
What are you laughing at?

09:03.887 --> 09:05.013
That's fucking
gold, man.

09:05.055 --> 09:06.973
Well, there.
Nice job, buddy.

09:07.015 --> 09:08.892
It's not a nice job.
That's fucking wicked!

09:08.934 --> 09:11.103
It's fucked, obviously.
What are you laughing about?

09:11.144 --> 09:13.021
That's one of the
funniest things I've
ever seen. It's great!

09:13.063 --> 09:14.856
It's not supposed
to be funny though, Ricky.

09:14.898 --> 09:16.149
That's the point.

09:16.191 --> 09:17.525
Oh, that's not good
because it is.

09:17.567 --> 09:18.735
It's really
fucking funny.

09:18.777 --> 09:20.279
It's supposed
to be serious.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.030
Yeah, let's watch
it again, man.
Now that we know...

09:22.072 --> 09:23.531
I don't need
to watch it again.

09:23.573 --> 09:24.866
First impressions
are all that matters

09:24.908 --> 09:26.868
and now I know what
the first impression is:

09:26.910 --> 09:29.204
that I'm a fucking dummy
and I made a silly video.

09:29.246 --> 09:30.872
So, I'm not going
to Austin anymore.

09:30.914 --> 09:32.373
No, no, no,
no, no, no.
We're done.

09:32.415 --> 09:34.542
We've got to...
Bubs, we've got
to go to Austin.

09:34.584 --> 09:36.044
Do you want
to get sued?

09:36.086 --> 09:37.545
No, but what's
the fucking point?

09:37.587 --> 09:39.214
I can't show that
to the producers.

09:39.256 --> 09:41.549
You're going to the
fucking show, man.
The show must go on.

09:41.591 --> 09:43.885
This is all
fucking lined up.

09:43.927 --> 09:45.386
Well, I've got
no demo to show.

09:45.428 --> 09:48.389
Well, let's just
shoot one when
we're down there.

09:48.431 --> 09:50.350
How?

09:50.391 --> 09:53.228
Let's just do it
right on fucking stage.

09:53.270 --> 09:55.688
There's going
to be 2,000
people there, man.

09:55.730 --> 09:58.566
Bring your space suit.
Do some stuff that
you're really good at.

09:58.608 --> 10:00.235
2,000 people?
Yeah, at least.

10:00.277 --> 10:02.237
And we still have
another day of
selling tickets, man.

10:02.279 --> 10:04.489
Whoa, whoa.
What the fuck?
Nobody told me that.

10:04.530 --> 10:05.907
Well, Ricky...
Oh, my fuck, boys.

10:05.949 --> 10:07.159
Don't count me out.
Okay?

10:07.200 --> 10:08.576
I got to go to
the liquor store
right now.

10:08.618 --> 10:10.120
I'm getting
fucked tonight!

10:10.162 --> 10:12.413
But you got to tell me
if you're coming
or not, Ricky!

10:12.455 --> 10:13.915
(Sighing)
It'll be fine, man.

10:13.957 --> 10:16.668
I'll help you out.
The thing'll be perfect.

10:16.709 --> 10:18.337
Production value.

10:18.378 --> 10:20.380
You get 2,000
screaming fans
watching you do this.

10:20.421 --> 10:22.590
It'll be on
tape for you.
And you'll help me?

10:22.632 --> 10:23.925
Of... It's going
to be perfect, man.

10:23.967 --> 10:25.593
You'll do
anything I need?

10:25.635 --> 10:28.221
Whatever you want.
All right?

10:28.263 --> 10:30.598
Now I've got to
rethink the whole
fucking thing!

10:30.640 --> 10:32.475
Well you come up
with some good shit, man,

10:32.517 --> 10:34.769
and we'll get it done.
Don't worry about it.

because, you know,
it's been a dream of his.

11:40.210 --> 11:42.003
But the main reason
why I'm going to Austin

11:42.045 --> 11:43.713
is to make money.

11:43.755 --> 11:45.840

a shit-ton more.

11:47.384 --> 11:49.177

11:50.720 --> 11:52.847

11:52.889 --> 11:54.640
Yeah, well, some people
in the park

11:54.682 --> 11:57.352
are saying that you're
spending too much time
with Julian.

11:57.394 --> 11:59.020
I'm not spending
too much time
with Julian.

11:59.062 --> 12:00.272
We're just working out.

12:00.313 --> 12:02.523
Oh. Does that include
having supper?

12:02.565 --> 12:04.192
We had supper once.
No big deal.

12:04.234 --> 12:06.361
Yeah, at the fireplace
table, Randy?

12:06.403 --> 12:09.030
Mr. Lahey, we're not talking
about personal stuff, right now,

12:09.072 --> 12:10.656
we're dealing
with park matters.

12:12.575 --> 12:14.035

12:16.746 --> 12:18.539
We're getting complaints
around here

12:18.581 --> 12:20.208
that you're friggin'
cranking your music too loud

12:20.250 --> 12:21.709

too much noise.

I'm gone.

you won't have to worry
about that, will you?

coming now?

to fucking go!

17:39.569 --> 17:43.698
Gimme a P, I, S.

17:43.740 --> 17:46.200
What'cha got? Piss!

17:46.242 --> 17:48.536
And what you gonna do?
Piss you!

17:48.578 --> 17:52.873
(Laughter)
Ah, fucking awesome.

17:52.915 --> 17:55.209
What in the fuck?

17:55.251 --> 17:56.711
You've got to be
fucking kidding me.

17:56.753 --> 17:59.714
All right, how the fuck
are you got glued to my hand?

17:59.756 --> 18:00.923
Fucking asshole!

18:00.965 --> 18:04.385
(Laughter)

18:04.427 --> 18:07.680
(Exhaling)
Fuck's sakes!

18:09.098 --> 18:11.726
(Laughter)
(Flicking lighter)

18:11.768 --> 18:15.563
(Mixed cheers)

18:15.605 --> 18:17.565
(Choking)

18:17.607 --> 18:19.066
Fuck!

18:19.108 --> 18:20.318
Right in there.

18:20.359 --> 18:21.527
Okay, I found you boys
some more liquor.

18:21.569 --> 18:23.195
Big bottle of gin,
fucking gross.

18:23.237 --> 18:26.574
Some of that black
licorice-tasting shit
you like on ice cream.

18:26.616 --> 18:28.576
So keep your fucking paws
off my rum, bud.

18:28.618 --> 18:30.286
Did you fucking
do this?
Do what?

18:30.328 --> 18:32.246
This thing is stuck
to my hand!

18:32.288 --> 18:35.416
Why the fuck would
I fucking touch
your piss jug?

18:35.458 --> 18:38.252
This is so fucked.

18:38.294 --> 18:40.254
Why would someone
put glue on a piss jug?

18:40.296 --> 18:43.090
(Coughing)

18:43.132 --> 18:45.426
What the fuck
are you smoking?

18:45.468 --> 18:46.803
I guess I should have
told you.

18:46.845 --> 18:48.262
It was weed and hash.

18:48.304 --> 18:51.265
I spilled piss
all over it, man.
Piss? Rick!

18:51.307 --> 18:52.600
(Spitting)
Boys!

18:52.642 --> 18:54.853
Boys, we have a fuckin'
official emergency.

18:54.894 --> 18:57.229
Who took the camera
I had put on the stage?
(Mixed cheers)

18:57.271 --> 19:00.441
The fuck you talking about?
I had a camera
on the stage, Ricky,

19:00.483 --> 19:02.985
to shoot my demo reel
and the fuckin'
thing's missing.

19:03.027 --> 19:05.446
(Hawks, spits)
It's critical to tonight.
Where is it?

19:05.488 --> 19:07.281
Bubs, we got
bigger problems
right now, okay?

19:07.323 --> 19:09.450
This thing is stuck
to my fucking hand.

19:09.492 --> 19:10.951
Probably because
one of you guys
put Krazy Glue on.

19:10.993 --> 19:12.787
You thought that'd
be funny? Really
fucking funny!

19:12.829 --> 19:15.832
I can't get it off!
Not without tearing skin.

19:15.874 --> 19:19.126
Ah, Ricky, tell me
that's not glued
to your fucking hand.

19:19.168 --> 19:20.503
Oh my God.
You listen to me,

19:20.545 --> 19:22.463
and you listen to me
very fucking carefully.

19:22.505 --> 19:24.924
Fuck off! Get the fuck
off my hand, you asshole!

19:24.965 --> 19:27.134
Ricky, Ricky, Ricky!
You're spilling it!

19:27.176 --> 19:29.970
Ricky! Ricky!
Ricky!
(Thuds)

19:30.012 --> 19:31.806
What is wrong with you?

19:31.848 --> 19:33.933
Oh my fuck, this is
going to shit already.

19:33.974 --> 19:36.811
We haven't shot
a fucking thing,
my camera's missing.

19:36.853 --> 19:38.563
I'm going to have
a fuckin' meltdown.

19:38.604 --> 19:40.314
Bubs, where'd you last
put the fuckin' camera?

19:40.356 --> 19:41.691
I had it on
the stage,
Julian.

19:41.733 --> 19:43.484
Now it's fucking gone.
I've got to find it

19:43.526 --> 19:45.319
or I'm going to
have a meltdown.

19:45.361 --> 19:47.655
We'll find
the fucking thing.
Calm down.

19:47.697 --> 19:48.865
Just wait.

19:48.907 --> 19:50.491
Here, it's here.

19:50.533 --> 19:52.493
Who the fuck
put it in the plant?

19:52.535 --> 19:54.161
That's not a camera.
That's too small, man.

19:54.203 --> 19:55.413
It looks like a baby TV.

19:55.454 --> 19:58.165
It's a camera, Ricky.
Look at the lens.

19:58.207 --> 20:00.501
Oh my God,
it's on, too.

20:00.543 --> 20:03.838
Okay boys, get
your scripts open
and onto the stage.

20:03.880 --> 20:06.674
Scripts?
I can't read right now.
I'm too fuckin' high.

20:06.716 --> 20:08.175
Well, we're going
on stage.
Ricky: I can't go out there

20:08.217 --> 20:09.385
with this glued
to my fuckin' hand!

20:09.427 --> 20:10.845
Bubbles:
Come on, we're going.

20:10.887 --> 20:12.137
Let's go.

20:12.179 --> 20:13.514
Ricky:
Where the fuck is the stage?

20:13.556 --> 20:14.933
Bubbles:
We're... it's right here.

20:14.974 --> 20:16.308
Just keep walking straight.

20:16.350 --> 20:18.185
Just come with me,
for fuck's sakes.

20:18.227 --> 20:19.353
Ricky:
This is fucked!

20:19.395 --> 20:20.563
Bubbles:
Just come with me.

20:20.605 --> 20:21.773
Ricky:
You're fucked.

20:21.814 --> 20:23.190
Julian:
Great!
(Crowd cheering)

20:23.232 --> 20:24.859
Julian:
Holy fuck! (Chuckling)

20:24.901 --> 20:26.861
Holy fuckballs. Wow!

20:26.903 --> 20:28.070
Bubbles:
(Giggling)

20:28.112 --> 20:29.363
(Crowd cheering)

20:29.405 --> 20:30.698
Julian:
This place is fuckin' packed.

20:30.740 --> 20:32.074
Ricky:
This is pretty fuckin' awesome.

20:32.116 --> 20:33.618
(Cheering)

20:33.659 --> 20:37.037
Bubbles:
Look at this guy.
Fuckin' right out of her!

20:37.079 --> 20:38.414
Right out of her.

20:40.374 --> 20:41.834
This fucking thing!

20:41.876 --> 20:43.711
(Giggling)

20:43.753 --> 20:45.588
Decent. Okay boys,
let me just...

20:45.630 --> 20:47.381
I'll just get this
fuckin' lined up

20:47.423 --> 20:49.133
and then we'll be
ready to rock here.

20:49.174 --> 20:50.718
What the fuck
are you doing?

20:50.760 --> 20:52.595
Don't worry about
it, Ricky. I'm
lining up my shot.

20:52.637 --> 20:54.013
Mind your own
business.

20:54.054 --> 20:55.598
Ah, fuck.

20:55.640 --> 20:57.642
Are your guys' asses
itchy inside?

20:57.683 --> 21:00.060
What? What the fuck
you talking about?

21:00.102 --> 21:02.313
Something going
on with my ass.
It's itchy.

21:02.354 --> 21:04.941
It's odd.
Ricky...
Ricky...

21:04.983 --> 21:07.986
Must have been all
those jalapenos
on the fuckin'...

21:08.027 --> 21:11.238
pulled pork sandwiches
or something...

21:11.280 --> 21:13.950
It's probably just
ass ants, Ricky.
Don't worry about it.

21:15.576 --> 21:17.036
It's probably what?

21:17.077 --> 21:20.456
Texas Ass Ants.

21:20.498 --> 21:23.250
What the fuck are
Texas Ass Ants?

21:23.292 --> 21:24.752
Texas Ass Ants!
Little bugs,

21:24.794 --> 21:27.922
live in your arse,
smell like relish.

21:27.964 --> 21:29.966
If you got 'em,
you better be careful

21:30.008 --> 21:32.802
'cause they start
fuckin' colonizing
in there, Ricky.

21:32.844 --> 21:36.472
Building roads,
and little houses
and things. They...

21:36.514 --> 21:38.474
Holy fuck, boys.
I better go deal
with this.

21:38.516 --> 21:40.184
Ricky...
Get back here, Ricky.

21:40.225 --> 21:42.144
What?
Just, just get back here.
Don't worry about it.

21:42.186 --> 21:44.229
Just joking, bud.
Oh, okay.

21:44.271 --> 21:45.815
Just relax.
(Giggling)

21:45.857 --> 21:47.316
All right, can we
start the show now?

21:47.358 --> 21:49.276
Yes, we can.

21:49.318 --> 21:53.031
(Audience cheering)

21:54.991 --> 21:56.241
Well...

21:56.283 --> 21:59.161
(Cheering continues)

22:00.287 --> 22:01.831
Nice.
Nice.

22:01.873 --> 22:03.415
Well here we are.
Still drunk...

22:03.457 --> 22:06.460
Very fuckin' high...
(Laughing)

22:06.502 --> 22:08.880
And unemployed.
But not for fuckin' long.

22:08.921 --> 22:11.841
Let me tell you
what's happening
here this evening.

22:11.883 --> 22:14.343
Okay, uh, we're
here tonight...

22:14.385 --> 22:15.928
(Giggling)
very excited.

22:15.970 --> 22:18.347
We're gonna be shooting
a demo here tonight.

22:18.389 --> 22:19.849
About two weeks ago,

22:19.891 --> 22:21.934
I was online and there
was a thing on there

22:21.976 --> 22:24.062
said you could be
in a Hollywood
ninja movie.

22:24.103 --> 22:27.023
They're looking
for people, and you
could submit a thing

22:27.065 --> 22:29.025
stating why you
felt you were right
for the part.

22:29.067 --> 22:32.444
So I wrote a very
eloquent letter
to the people.

22:32.486 --> 22:33.863
And I got
a fuckin' call-back.

22:33.905 --> 22:35.823
They said, if you can
get the fuck down here

22:35.865 --> 22:38.367
with a demo, and show it
to us that you can act,

22:38.409 --> 22:40.036
we might put you
in the movie.

22:40.078 --> 22:43.081
So we are fuckin'
shooting my demo
tonight, baby!

22:43.122 --> 22:44.832
Yep.
(Wild cheers)

22:44.874 --> 22:46.876
I'm gonna be in a
fuckin' ninja movie!

22:46.918 --> 22:48.878
I hope it's...
hope it's better
than the last one.

22:48.920 --> 22:50.462
'Cause the last one
you shot was a little...

22:50.504 --> 22:52.840
Ricky.
I shot one demo already

22:52.882 --> 22:55.009
and they were teasing
me about it so now we
gotta make a better one.

22:55.051 --> 22:56.886
But it's not just
all about you.

22:56.928 --> 22:58.804
I mean, the reason
I came on this
fuckin' trip is,

22:58.846 --> 23:00.598
I have an idea
that's gonna change
the world and...

23:00.639 --> 23:02.224
Julian: (Laugh)
it's gonna help
me retire.

23:02.266 --> 23:04.143
And I want to talk
about that at some
point tonight.

23:04.184 --> 23:06.353
Well, you can talk
about that when we're
done with all my stuff

23:06.395 --> 23:08.188
'cause tonight
is my thing.

23:08.230 --> 23:10.482
And listen, Bubs,
I got a bit of work
to do tonight.

23:10.524 --> 23:11.859
It's going to take me
about ten minutes.

23:11.901 --> 23:13.611
Why do you gotta
fuckin' work tonight?

23:13.652 --> 23:15.487
You're working
with me, for me.
Do you know how much...

23:15.529 --> 23:16.906
Bubs...
This is my night.
Bubs,

23:16.948 --> 23:18.991
do you know how
much it cost to get
us down here?

23:19.033 --> 23:20.576
I gotta work a bit.

23:20.618 --> 23:21.953
Bubbles: (Huffing)
Plus, Bubs,
just a sec, man.

23:21.994 --> 23:23.537
I got a surprise
for you tonight.

23:23.579 --> 23:25.497
It's all planned out.
You'll get it later.

23:25.539 --> 23:27.125
Okay. That sounds
fuckin' awesome.

23:27.166 --> 23:28.834
Do you have any
fingernail remover, Bubs?

23:28.876 --> 23:30.335
Get this off
my fuckin' hand.

23:30.377 --> 23:32.046
Bubbles:
Any what?

23:32.088 --> 23:35.424
Fingernail remover.
That shit that
gets stuff unstuck.

23:35.466 --> 23:37.176
Bubbles:
Fingernail remover?

23:37.217 --> 23:40.054
You looking to get
rid of the whole nail,
are you, Ricky?

23:40.096 --> 23:41.764
Here, let's get our
helmets on, boys.

23:41.806 --> 23:43.724
Fuck, I should have
talked to you about this.

23:43.766 --> 23:46.936
Don't be mad.
Where's the fuckin'
other helmet at?

23:46.978 --> 23:48.729
I fucked up. There was
three of them.
I know.

23:48.771 --> 23:50.773
I thought it was one
of those stainless
steely kind of bowls

23:50.815 --> 23:53.067
and I was trying to
make some honey oil...

23:53.109 --> 23:55.694
(Audience laughter)
put the torch to it,

23:55.736 --> 23:58.072
the fuckin' thing melted
and caught on fire, but...

23:58.114 --> 24:00.992
For fuck's sakes,
Ricky. Here, put
your helmet on.

24:01.033 --> 24:03.285
Just... he
can use mine.
No, he can't.

24:03.327 --> 24:05.204
Bubs, I don't want
to put that fuckin'
thing on, man.

24:05.245 --> 24:07.665
Julian, you put
that fuckin' helmet
on, right now.

24:07.706 --> 24:09.500
(Chuckle)
I'm not submitting a demo

24:09.541 --> 24:11.293
where one of the
fuckin' astronauts

24:11.335 --> 24:13.504
doesn't have a
goddamn helmet on.
This fuckin' thing.

24:13.545 --> 24:16.340
That's ridiculous!
Now get it on!

24:16.381 --> 24:18.342
Fuck sakes.
Put it on!

24:18.383 --> 24:21.595
Bubs, we're fuckin'
grown adults here, man.
I know! I know.

24:21.637 --> 24:24.015
Listen, man.
What?

24:24.056 --> 24:27.101
We're not really fuckin'
going to space right
now, are we? 'Cause...

24:27.143 --> 24:29.937
Yes, Ricky. The whole
theatre's gonna fuckin'
rip out of the ground

24:29.979 --> 24:31.939
and we're going up.
(Audience cheering)

24:31.981 --> 24:33.774
You just wait.
That's pretty trippy.

24:33.816 --> 24:35.526
Yeah, just wait.
What are you doing?

24:35.567 --> 24:37.862
Just hold still.

24:37.903 --> 24:39.613
Bubs, I can't see,
for fuck's sakes!

24:39.655 --> 24:41.365
Just hold still, Ricky.

24:41.406 --> 24:44.743
I've built enough
fuckin' space
helmets in my day.

24:44.785 --> 24:48.122
I know how to make
a quick space helmet.

24:48.164 --> 24:49.498
There we go.

24:49.540 --> 24:51.458
Perfect! Look at that.

24:51.500 --> 24:53.544
There you go.
(Audience cheering)

24:53.585 --> 24:54.920
Perfect.

24:54.962 --> 24:56.714
I better not
look stupid.

24:56.755 --> 24:58.298
Ricky, you look
like a dick.

24:58.340 --> 25:00.509
Put yours on!

25:00.551 --> 25:02.261
Put it on, Julian.
For fuck's sakes, Bubs.

25:02.302 --> 25:05.764
Either it goes on
or my boot goes
right in your nuts.

25:05.806 --> 25:08.475
Do it, Bubs.
So your... your pick.

25:08.517 --> 25:10.811
Fuck's sakes.
(Laughing)

25:10.853 --> 25:13.147
You look fucked.
Not as fucked
as you look.

25:13.189 --> 25:15.024
There. You look awesome.

25:15.066 --> 25:17.026
You look awesome.
All right, let's get
in the rocket, boys.

25:17.068 --> 25:19.028
Where does this,
uh, where do you
plug that in?

25:19.070 --> 25:23.199
You can drive that
right in your arse
for all I care, Ricky.

25:23.241 --> 25:25.034
Okay boys,
in the rocket.
Here we go.

25:25.076 --> 25:26.535
What do you mean
in the rocket?

25:26.577 --> 25:28.079
In the rocket?
Get in the rocket.

25:28.120 --> 25:31.331
Ah, Bubs you've got to
be fuckin' kidding me.

25:31.373 --> 25:33.918
(Laughter)

25:33.959 --> 25:35.460
Bubbles,
this is fucked.

25:35.502 --> 25:36.921
This is really
fucked, Bubs.

25:38.172 --> 25:42.051
Bubbles, Hollywood
ninja movie
audition tape.

25:42.093 --> 25:45.304
"Apollo 13" re-enactment,
take one. Mark it.

25:45.345 --> 25:46.764
Fuck's sakes.

25:46.805 --> 25:49.516
This is gonna
be decent!
I hope so, man.

25:49.558 --> 25:52.519
(Roaring)
Holy fuck, man!
A tiger!

25:52.561 --> 25:54.813
Ricky...
Ricky, relax.
Fuck!

25:54.855 --> 25:57.524
It's just on
the screen.

25:57.566 --> 26:00.402
This looks pretty
good, Bubs.
Shh!

26:00.444 --> 26:03.447
Uh, Houston this is
Commander Bubbles
in the rocket here.

26:03.488 --> 26:05.699
I'm just going
to go through
pre-flight checklist,

26:05.741 --> 26:07.576
if that's all right.

26:07.618 --> 26:10.370
Here we go.
Retro. Go.

26:10.412 --> 26:11.663
Econ. Go.

26:11.705 --> 26:13.707
Let's get her
going here. Five!

26:13.749 --> 26:16.043
Are we in that
fuckin' thing?
Four!

26:16.085 --> 26:17.377
Three!

26:17.419 --> 26:19.046
Two!

26:19.088 --> 26:20.298
One!

26:20.339 --> 26:22.258
(Imitating
switch clicks)
Here we go!

26:22.300 --> 26:23.884
She's starting to
shake here, boys.

26:23.926 --> 26:25.344
Bubs, we're on fire!
We're on fire!

26:25.385 --> 26:26.720
No, we're...
it's all right, Ricky.

26:26.762 --> 26:28.472
Fuck!
Julian!

26:28.513 --> 26:30.724
Punch in the coordinates
for the moon, please.
Punch in the what?

26:30.766 --> 26:32.476
Coordinates to
the moon! Ricky,

26:32.517 --> 26:34.061
re-route the
guidance system

26:34.103 --> 26:35.938
Holy fuck!
through the subsystem
at level B, please.

26:35.980 --> 26:37.731
All right.
Holy fuck!

26:37.773 --> 26:39.566
She's really
starting to shake
here, Houston.

26:39.608 --> 26:40.985
Okay, I'm trying
to hold her.

26:41.026 --> 26:42.402
She's starting
to yaw on me.

26:42.444 --> 26:43.695
I'm gonna do
a pitch over.

26:43.737 --> 26:45.572
Ricky, re-route...

26:45.614 --> 26:47.825
re-route the subsystem
flight monitor B.

26:47.866 --> 26:49.994
What does that mean, Bubs?
What does that mean?

26:50.035 --> 26:52.079
Oh, Ricky!
What the fuck is that?

26:52.121 --> 26:54.832
(Alarm sounding)
Holy fuck! We got
an MPS warning light!

26:54.873 --> 26:56.750
A what?
Holy fuck, Houston!

26:56.792 --> 26:58.460
I'm trying to fire!

26:58.502 --> 27:01.088
Do you want me
to reconfuckulate
these things?

27:01.130 --> 27:03.465
(Mixed shouting)

27:03.507 --> 27:05.092
Fuck!
Jesus Christ,
Ricky!

27:05.134 --> 27:06.969
Holy fuck!

27:07.011 --> 27:09.180
Fuckin' kidding me?

27:09.221 --> 27:12.850
Houston, I am
covered in piss! Ah!

27:12.891 --> 27:15.644
Uh, cancel that last
transmission, Houston.

27:15.686 --> 27:18.605
We did not spill
piss in the rocket.
We are still a go.

27:18.647 --> 27:21.692
Bubs, I have piss
in my fuckin' mouth!
We're done!

27:21.733 --> 27:23.777
Ricky!

27:23.819 --> 27:25.363
Fuck sakes!

27:25.404 --> 27:26.613
Cut!
Ricky:
Fuck!

27:26.655 --> 27:27.906
Cut the fuckin' thing!

27:27.948 --> 27:30.617
(Audience cheering)

27:30.659 --> 27:32.786
What the fuck is
wrong with you, Ricky?

27:32.828 --> 27:34.121
(Spitting)

27:34.163 --> 27:35.956
Every time we try
to do something,

27:35.998 --> 27:39.126
you end up with
piss in your mouth!
Why is that?

27:39.168 --> 27:42.880
I haven't had piss
in my mouth in a
fuckin' very long time.

27:42.921 --> 27:44.756
Please... get
this off my hand.

27:44.798 --> 27:47.301
Ricky, you get the fuck
away from me with that.
Get that thing away from me!

27:47.343 --> 27:48.802
Ricky:
Come on. Just
grab it a little.

27:48.844 --> 27:50.721
Get it away from me,
you asshole!

27:50.762 --> 27:52.223
Fuck...
Bubbles:
Ricky!

27:52.264 --> 27:54.558
Julian:
You're spilling it
everywhere!

27:54.599 --> 27:56.435
Bubbles: Why wouldn't you
put a cap on it,
for fuck's sakes?

27:56.476 --> 27:58.312
Fuck!

27:58.354 --> 27:59.688
(Spitting)

27:59.730 --> 28:00.981
Why wouldn't you...
(Grunt)

28:01.023 --> 28:03.525
(Audience exclaiming,
laughing)

28:05.027 --> 28:08.530
Ricky:
Where the fuck did that go?

28:08.572 --> 28:10.157
It went right
out there.

28:10.199 --> 28:11.867
Ricky:
I am fuckin'
sorry about that.

28:11.909 --> 28:13.452
It's mostly...

28:13.493 --> 28:16.621
pretty much pure alcohol,
I think, but...

28:16.663 --> 28:17.998
Yeah, it doesn't
smell that bad.

28:18.040 --> 28:19.833
It fuckin' smells
terrible, Ricky!

28:19.875 --> 28:22.211
Ricky, look at you...
It smells like goat piss.

28:22.253 --> 28:24.796
You're covered in
your piss, Ricky.

28:24.838 --> 28:27.341
It's not the first time,
it's not that bad.
It's not that...

28:27.383 --> 28:29.343
Look, he's not even
embarrassed about
this, Bubs.

28:29.385 --> 28:31.345
He doesn't get
embarrassed. He's
not smart enough.

28:31.387 --> 28:34.514
Ricky, go out back,
get out of those
pissy clothes

28:34.556 --> 28:36.392
and get the fuck
back out here.

28:36.434 --> 28:38.060
Don't talk to me
like I'm a fuckin'
dog, Julian.

28:38.102 --> 28:39.603
Don't do that.
We're friends.

28:39.644 --> 28:42.522
I'm trying to help
you out right now.
Say please.

28:42.564 --> 28:44.608
I'm not
saying please.
I'm not going anywhere.

28:44.649 --> 28:47.569
I'll stay covered
in piss all night.
I don't give a fuck.

28:47.611 --> 28:50.530
Ricky,
will you please,

28:50.572 --> 28:52.699
please fly the
fuck backstage,

28:52.741 --> 28:55.453
get out of your pissy
clothes, stop acting
like a fuckin' dickweed

28:55.494 --> 28:58.330
and get back out
here? Please?
Yes, I will.

28:58.372 --> 29:00.874
'Cause that's how you
talk to your fuckin'
friends, you asshole.

29:00.916 --> 29:02.501
(Audience laughter)

29:02.542 --> 29:05.045
Fuck's sakes!
Fuck, I hate
playing space!

29:05.087 --> 29:06.630
I'm covered
in piss again.

29:06.671 --> 29:09.007
What is wrong with his brain?
You know what?
What?

29:09.049 --> 29:10.426
Gemini 3 was
a two-man mission.

29:10.468 --> 29:12.886
We can do it as Gemini 3,
John Young, Gus Grissom.

29:12.928 --> 29:14.430
Get the fuck back
in the rocket.

29:14.472 --> 29:16.640
Bubs, I'm not
playing anymore space.
What?

29:16.681 --> 29:18.934
There's piss all over
the fuckin' rocket!
I can't use that footage!

29:18.976 --> 29:20.978
I'm not getting
down there.
I can't use that.

29:21.019 --> 29:23.063
We've got to re-shoot it.
Look, you know what?

29:23.105 --> 29:25.149
I've got some work
to take care of and I'm
going to do it right now,

29:25.190 --> 29:26.817
while he's
getting changed.
But my demo!

29:26.858 --> 29:28.652
We'll take care of
that in a minute.

29:28.693 --> 29:30.737
Aw, for fuck's sakes!

29:30.779 --> 29:33.449
What are you doing?
I'm going to sell
some hamburgers.

29:33.491 --> 29:35.575
(Audience laughter)

29:35.617 --> 29:38.412
Ah Julian, you're not
selling hamburgers
right now.

29:38.454 --> 29:41.540
Why not? Everybody's
drunk and high. They
want something to eat.

29:41.581 --> 29:44.251
Who wants a fuckin'
Julian Burger?
(Audience cheering)

29:44.293 --> 29:47.296
See? You help me out,
I'll help you out.

29:47.338 --> 29:49.006
That's the way
it's gonna go.

29:49.047 --> 29:50.299
All right, just form
a line right here.

29:50.341 --> 29:52.009
Get your money out.
Ten bucks.

29:52.050 --> 29:53.927
Have it ready. Let's go.
Come on! Let's go.

29:53.969 --> 29:56.430
For fuck's sakes.
Best fuckin' hamburger
you'll ever have.

29:56.472 --> 29:58.432
Here we go. This guy
has a nice jersey.

29:58.474 --> 30:00.476
Right on, brother. Ten bucks.
Bubbles:
Unbelievable.

30:00.518 --> 30:02.602
You want two, man, or one?
I'll take one more.

30:02.644 --> 30:03.979
Right on, man, thank you.

30:04.021 --> 30:05.356
All right, let's
keep it going, guys.

30:05.397 --> 30:08.150
Bubbles:
Ah, don't be coming up.

30:08.192 --> 30:10.610
Julian:
Let's go, let's go.
Money out. Awesome.

30:10.652 --> 30:14.198
Bubbles: Come down to the
Paramount Theatre
in Austin, Texas!

30:14.239 --> 30:16.616
Fuckin' watch Julian
sell fuckin' hamburgers

30:16.658 --> 30:18.160
to stoned people!
Thanks, man.

30:18.202 --> 30:19.495
This is fuckin' bullshit!

30:19.537 --> 30:21.830
Julian:
Thank you! That's very nice.

30:21.872 --> 30:23.999
I just got a tip, man.
30 bucks!

30:24.041 --> 30:26.960
This is bullshit.
(Indistinct)

30:27.002 --> 30:28.420
Get the fuck
out of my face.

30:28.462 --> 30:30.464
Get the money out
or get out of here.

30:30.506 --> 30:32.632
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

30:32.674 --> 30:34.468
Fuckin' look, you're
like the fuckin' zombies

30:34.510 --> 30:37.095
on "The Walking Dead".
Julian:
Right on!

30:37.137 --> 30:41.433
Carting along here
for a fuckin' dirty
old cheeseburger.

30:41.475 --> 30:44.269
Bubs, you want to give
me a hand here, man?
This is fuckin' crazy.

30:44.311 --> 30:46.646
Well, pick up the pace.
I'm trying to.

30:46.688 --> 30:48.065
Let's go, guys.
Let's go!

30:48.106 --> 30:50.025
Pick it up, pick it up,
pick it up.

30:50.067 --> 30:52.194
Here, I'll show you
how to get rid of all
the hamburgers at once.

30:52.236 --> 30:53.778
All right, ladies
and gentlemen,

30:53.820 --> 30:55.906
I'm going to make
a one-time offer
here this evening.

30:55.947 --> 30:57.991
A one-time offer.

30:58.033 --> 31:00.827
All right, come down
here with a $50 bill.

31:00.869 --> 31:02.954
$50 bill you get
10 cheeseburgers

31:02.996 --> 31:04.623
and kiss Julian
on the mouth.

31:04.664 --> 31:05.999
Who wants to neck
with Julian?

31:06.041 --> 31:07.543
Bubs, that's not
going to happen.

31:07.585 --> 31:10.087
Ladies, form a line here.
Men, form a line here.

31:10.128 --> 31:12.005
(Audience laughter)

31:12.047 --> 31:14.425
Get what? Gimme 100?
...can we both do it?

31:14.466 --> 31:16.427
What the fuck you
talking about it?
Just give me...

31:16.468 --> 31:18.845
Yes, give him 100 bucks,
you can both kiss him
on the lips!

31:18.887 --> 31:20.556
Julian:
Bubs! I'm selling hamburgers!

31:20.598 --> 31:22.391
Well, I'm selling
you, my friend.
...just give me that.

31:22.433 --> 31:24.809
And what else
do you have? That's it?

31:24.851 --> 31:26.478
Thanks, man.
Hey, hey!

31:26.520 --> 31:28.688
For 100 bucks,
I'll give you
10 burgers,

31:28.730 --> 31:30.232
you can kiss him
on the mouth,

31:30.274 --> 31:32.025
grab his tits and
play with his wiener.

31:32.067 --> 31:33.735
Thanks, man.
100 bucks,
right now.

31:33.777 --> 31:35.362
Julian:
Bubs, what are you doing?

31:35.404 --> 31:38.532
Who wants to grab
Julian's wiener
for $100?

31:38.574 --> 31:40.367
Julian:
Bubs, I'm... Stop trying
to pimp me out, man.

31:40.409 --> 31:42.536
Ladies, here. Men, here.
I'm selling burgers.

31:42.578 --> 31:44.913
The bisexual Julian will
let anybody in the theatre
I'm not a bisexual.

31:44.955 --> 31:46.915
play with his wiener.
What the fuck are
you talking about?

31:46.957 --> 31:49.585
Either pick up the pace,
or I'm getting it
really going here.

31:49.627 --> 31:51.711
I'm going, man...
Full sexual intercourse
with Julian.

31:51.753 --> 31:54.047
Full sex...
Bubs, come on.

31:54.089 --> 31:55.549
Thank you.

31:55.591 --> 31:58.469
This is fuckin'
bullshit.
This is awesome, man.

31:58.510 --> 32:00.137
Almost done, Bubs.
Almost done.

32:00.178 --> 32:02.722
Fuckin' better be.
I got a few more here.

32:02.764 --> 32:05.309
Let's go. Four left.

32:05.350 --> 32:07.060
Here you go.
There's two.

32:07.102 --> 32:09.480
Two burgers left.
Unbelievable.

32:09.521 --> 32:11.231
All right. 20 bucks.
20 bucks a burger.

32:11.273 --> 32:12.899
There you go.
20 bucks a burger.

32:12.941 --> 32:15.569
All right,
we'll take that.
Here, Bubs, take...

32:15.611 --> 32:17.404
That's yours.

32:17.446 --> 32:19.030
20 bucks for
the last burger.

32:19.072 --> 32:21.074
Oh, decent!
Julian:
Right on, man.

32:21.116 --> 32:23.076
Decent, look at that.
(Audience cheering)

32:23.118 --> 32:24.495
Julian:
You're the man, brother.
Thank you.

32:24.536 --> 32:27.080
Covered in my own piss,
for fuck's sakes.

32:27.122 --> 32:28.582
(Growling)

32:28.624 --> 32:30.917
Fuck, I hate playing Space.
Get the fuck off me!

32:30.959 --> 32:32.752
What's up with
the camera in the
dressing room?

32:32.794 --> 32:35.088
I didn't put it in there.
My camera's right there.

32:35.130 --> 32:37.675
You didn't put it
in there? Who put
it in there?

32:37.716 --> 32:39.384
I don't know.

32:39.426 --> 32:42.053
What the fuck is
going on with my ass?

32:42.095 --> 32:44.055
Julian:
Ricky...

32:44.097 --> 32:46.684
Bubbles:
He's wiping his face with
bong water, for fuck's sakes.

32:46.725 --> 32:48.686
(Audience laughter)

32:48.727 --> 32:50.604
Aw, Ricky!...

32:50.646 --> 32:54.107
He doesn't know he's
on camera, Julian.

32:54.149 --> 32:55.900
For God's sakes, Ricky.
No, no, no.

32:55.942 --> 32:58.278
Don't do it, Ricky.
Aw don't,
Ricky. Ricky!

32:58.320 --> 33:00.030
Ricky! Ah...
(Sniffing)

33:00.071 --> 33:03.450
(Audience laughter)

33:03.492 --> 33:05.952
No... Ricky!
Will you get him?

33:05.994 --> 33:08.455
He doesn't know!
Ricky!

33:08.497 --> 33:10.248
All right, you
fuckin' asshole!

33:10.290 --> 33:11.958
You're coming off,
right the fuck now...

33:12.000 --> 33:14.503
Fuck! Fuck!
Get the fuck off me!

33:16.254 --> 33:19.257
Think you're fuckin'
stronger than me, huh?

33:19.299 --> 33:21.134
Ricky, Ricky,
what are you doing?

33:21.176 --> 33:22.969
Get your suit back on!

33:23.011 --> 33:26.056
Listen Bubs,
me playing space is done.

33:26.097 --> 33:28.141
My brain doesn't
work right in space.

33:28.183 --> 33:31.395
Ricky, come on.
You fuckin' promised me
you were going to do this.

33:31.436 --> 33:33.980
Now get your suit on.
What the fuck do we
got to play space

33:34.022 --> 33:35.857
to get you in a
ninja movie anyway?
It's stupid!

33:35.899 --> 33:38.235
'Cause they gotta see
all the different
types of acting.

33:38.276 --> 33:40.945
The action and the drama.
Come on, Ricky.

33:40.987 --> 33:42.698
This is my big night
and you promised.

33:42.740 --> 33:44.908
Listen, Bubs.
Tonight's not just
about you, okay.

33:44.949 --> 33:46.826
I got big plans
for tonight.

33:46.868 --> 33:49.120
Like, you know how big
the moon is? That's
how big my plans are.

33:49.162 --> 33:51.039
It's gonna change the
fuckin' world like
I've been telling you.

33:51.081 --> 33:52.999
I know you've been
telling me, but...

33:53.041 --> 33:56.836
but maybe you should
fuckin' run it by me
before you tell people.

33:56.878 --> 33:59.839
Let's get out there.
I'm gonna unveil it
to the world right now.

33:59.881 --> 34:01.841
If Julian thinks it's
dumb, you back me up.

34:01.883 --> 34:03.677
Right, 'kay buddy?
Who's got your belly?

34:03.719 --> 34:05.554
Just don't
touch me, Ricky.
Who's got your elbows?

34:05.596 --> 34:08.389
Nobody.
Who's got your nose?
Ricky!

34:08.431 --> 34:10.350
Come on, man, let's go!
Let's get out there.

34:12.811 --> 34:15.855
Bubbles:
I've got to deal
with something!

34:15.897 --> 34:17.733
Oh my fuck!

34:22.152 --> 34:23.905
Julian:
Jesus, what's going on, Rick?

34:23.947 --> 34:25.532
Ricky:
Just getting a drink, man.

34:25.574 --> 34:27.409
Well, get the fuck out
here, man. I'm by myself.

34:27.451 --> 34:30.704
(Audience cheering)

34:30.746 --> 34:32.664
What the fuck
is going on here?

34:32.706 --> 34:34.708
I'm selling hamburgers.
That's what the fuck
is going on.

34:34.750 --> 34:36.501
You're selling
hamburgers?
Yeah.

34:36.543 --> 34:38.795
That's fuckin'
greasy.
That's greasy?

34:38.837 --> 34:40.505
Yeah.
No, no, no.

34:40.547 --> 34:43.007
Digging at your ass
and smelling it is
fuckin' greasy, bro.

34:43.049 --> 34:45.051
I wasn't digging
my ass and smelling it,
thank you very much.

34:45.092 --> 34:46.844
Rick, you just appeared
on this big screen.

34:46.886 --> 34:49.054
You did a couple
ghost wipes, took
a couple sniffs,

34:49.097 --> 34:50.474
we all watched you.

34:50.514 --> 34:52.391
It was fuckin'
gross, man.

34:52.434 --> 34:54.143
What's wrong with you?
Well, what the fuck?

34:54.185 --> 34:56.396
Who's putting cameras
around the place?
I don't know.

34:56.438 --> 34:58.231
What's this big thing
you've got planned

34:58.273 --> 35:00.609
that's bigger than
the moon? I can't wait
to fucking hear this.

35:00.651 --> 35:02.902
Where's Bubbles? I was
hoping he was going to
be here for this too.

35:02.944 --> 35:04.946
This is big, boys.
Like, this is my retirement.

35:04.988 --> 35:07.240
And you guys can hopefully
be involved if you want.

35:07.282 --> 35:08.659
(Mixed shouts)
All right.

35:08.700 --> 35:10.494
I want to start a school.
(Incredulous laugh)

35:10.535 --> 35:12.579
You want to start
a school?
I do.

35:12.621 --> 35:15.833
Come on!
The regular schools
right now, they're fucked.

35:15.874 --> 35:18.168
You go there and...

35:18.209 --> 35:19.670
Hey, Bubs.
Just telling Julian,

35:19.711 --> 35:22.631
my big idea:
starting a school.

35:22.673 --> 35:24.341
Who is?

35:24.382 --> 35:26.259
I'm going to start a
school and you guys can
be involved if you want.

35:26.301 --> 35:28.512
It's going to be
my retirement.
You're starting a school?

35:28.553 --> 35:30.263
Yeah, 'cause the
schools right now,
I mean, you go there

35:30.305 --> 35:32.683
and get big, dumb
fucking words
put in your head

35:32.724 --> 35:34.351
and big stupid
numbers and...

35:34.392 --> 35:35.977
You should be learning
real life-y shit, like...

35:36.019 --> 35:38.104
how to fucking make
a grilled cheese
with an iron,

35:38.146 --> 35:39.815
how to swim,
how to play hockey,

35:39.857 --> 35:41.733
Oh, Ricky...
how to fix
your lawnmower.

35:41.775 --> 35:44.444
They... they teach
that at different
places, you know.

35:44.486 --> 35:46.404
People know how
to do that already.

35:46.446 --> 35:49.240
I don't think you should be
trying to start a school. Okay,
no,

35:49.282 --> 35:50.575
but it's way bigger
than that, way bigger.

35:50.617 --> 35:52.536
Like, the last few nights,

35:52.577 --> 35:54.538
I've been getting
super fucked up and
you've been passing out.

35:54.579 --> 35:56.331
I've got all these things
going on in my head

35:56.373 --> 35:58.458
and you're like,
"writle them down."

35:58.500 --> 36:01.127
So I writle down a bunch
of thinks and wrotled thoks
and drew some pictures...

36:01.169 --> 36:03.588
Next day I'm reading
through this shit, going,
"Holy fuck, Ricky.

36:03.630 --> 36:05.465
"Like, you...
you've got a lot
of shit in your head

36:05.507 --> 36:07.342
that people need
to get learnt."

36:07.384 --> 36:09.969
So, only way
to do that, start
a fucking school.

36:10.011 --> 36:12.472
Okay Ricky, don't take
this the wrong way,

36:12.514 --> 36:14.015
Yeah.
or anything
but, I mean,

36:14.057 --> 36:16.434
you need to be
really smart to
start a school

36:16.476 --> 36:18.478
and you just...
in that one sentence,

36:18.520 --> 36:20.564
I counted five words
you fucked up.

36:20.605 --> 36:22.774
One sentence.
So, I mean,

36:22.816 --> 36:24.860
it's probably
not your thing.
You know what I mean?

36:24.902 --> 36:27.070
But see, that's
the good thing
about my school,

36:27.111 --> 36:29.072
is that you don't fuck up words.
Whatever you say
is a word.

36:29.113 --> 36:32.659
Ricky, you said
writled, wrotled,
thinks and thoks.

36:32.701 --> 36:35.704
Those aren't words.
They are at my
school, bud.

36:35.746 --> 36:37.956
And I've got a great
fucking name for it too.
Listen to this.

36:37.997 --> 36:40.667
I can't wait.
It's... got to be a
church for tax reasons

36:40.709 --> 36:43.086
but it is going
to be a school.

36:43.127 --> 36:45.296
So it's going to be
called the Church School
of the Freedomerist.

36:45.338 --> 36:47.382
'Cause you're going
to have so many fucking
freedomers at the school

36:47.424 --> 36:48.759
you can basically
do what you want.

36:48.800 --> 36:50.844
The Freedomerist?
Fuck, yeah.

36:50.886 --> 36:52.512
See, that's...
right there, Ricky.

36:52.554 --> 36:54.347
Problem number two:
Freedomerist.

36:54.389 --> 36:55.891
Right in the name:
not a fucking word.

36:55.933 --> 36:58.685
Like I said, it is
at my fucking school.

36:58.727 --> 37:01.145
You can smoke dope,
you can have a few drinks.

37:01.187 --> 37:02.856
Ricky, Ricky,
Ricky... Rick.

37:02.898 --> 37:04.357
Listen to me.
What?

37:04.399 --> 37:06.818
I looked through all
the stuff you wrote
down this morning.

37:06.860 --> 37:08.820
Mm-hmm.
You cannot base
a school on that shit.

37:08.862 --> 37:10.697
No, no, that's
just the start, man.

37:10.739 --> 37:12.699
I'm gonna keep
writling and wrotling
till Christmas

37:12.741 --> 37:14.534
and we'll open in
the New Year, boys.

37:14.576 --> 37:17.203
Fuck, Rick.
It's gonna be big.
You don't understand.

37:17.245 --> 37:19.748
Like, would anybody here
come to the Church School
of the Freedomerist?

37:19.790 --> 37:21.666
(Cheering)

37:21.708 --> 37:24.335
Don't encourage him.
Exactly.

37:24.377 --> 37:26.212
I know if I could've
drank and smoked dope,

37:26.254 --> 37:28.256
I probably would've
stayed at school
a lot longer, so...

37:28.298 --> 37:30.174
Okay well,
you know what?

37:30.216 --> 37:32.051
That's fucking
great, Ricky. It's
all fine and dandy.

37:32.093 --> 37:33.887
Now let's get
back to shooting
my demo, please.

37:33.929 --> 37:35.764
I guess so, if that's
what you think.

37:35.806 --> 37:37.682
But, I don't know.
What are we
going to shoot?

37:37.724 --> 37:39.684
Well, I mean,
what are you...

37:39.726 --> 37:41.686
how are you going to
get people to fucking
join your school?

37:41.728 --> 37:43.730
First of all.
There's about 40,000
people here tonight

37:43.772 --> 37:45.732
If I...
(Audience laughter)

37:45.774 --> 37:47.901
If I got a pretition
going, they'd put their...

37:47.943 --> 37:50.528
signatures on it
with some marklers.

37:50.570 --> 37:53.448
And we can open
this fucking thing.
(Mixed shouts)

37:53.490 --> 37:55.450
You guys into that?
(Audience cheering)

37:55.492 --> 37:58.161
Nice. The people
have spoken, Bubs.

37:58.202 --> 38:00.288
Okay, just wait,
just wait.

38:00.330 --> 38:02.958
This could actually work
really well, Julian.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.084
I've got a way we might
be able to shoot my demo

38:05.126 --> 38:07.587
and do your thing...
do them both at
the same time.

38:07.629 --> 38:09.673
Get two birds
stoned at once?

38:09.714 --> 38:11.382
(Audience cheering)
Nice.

38:11.424 --> 38:13.092
This could be awesome.

38:13.134 --> 38:14.886
This could be awesome.
I'm gonna shoot this.

38:14.928 --> 38:16.972
(Whispering)
Get three ladies
out of the audience.

38:17.014 --> 38:19.516
You want to do this? Right on,
Bubs.
Three ladies.

38:19.557 --> 38:21.977
I thought you were going to
think this idea's kind of
fucked. I'm glad you're into it.

38:22.019 --> 38:23.687
Julian:
It is fucked.
Oh, no, it's...

38:23.728 --> 38:25.689
it's fantastic,
Ricky. (Chuckling)

38:25.730 --> 38:27.565
All right, Danny,
turn up the
fucking lights.

38:27.607 --> 38:29.651
(Sigh)
Ricky:
You got some papers?

38:29.693 --> 38:31.528
Okay, I'm looking
for three ladies

38:31.569 --> 38:32.946
who'd like to come up and...

38:32.988 --> 38:35.490
do whatever the fuck
Bubs wants you to do.

38:35.532 --> 38:37.450
Look at you.

38:37.492 --> 38:39.285
Just a sec.
Are you Lahey-drunk?

38:39.327 --> 38:40.537
You look pretty fucked up.

38:40.578 --> 38:42.121
Julian:
You are?
Yeah!

38:42.163 --> 38:43.540
You're not going
to piss yourself

38:43.581 --> 38:45.166
or anything up here?
Or puke?

38:45.208 --> 38:47.002
All right,
get the fuck up here.

38:47.044 --> 38:48.628
Nice.
Uhh....

38:48.670 --> 38:50.839
Come on up.
Can we hand this
fucking thing around?

38:50.881 --> 38:52.841
If you guys put your
signature on this,
And...

38:52.883 --> 38:55.010
it'll help me fuck over
the Canadian government,
and that is awesome.

38:55.052 --> 38:57.721
Can you just...
hand that to
someone. Thank you.

38:57.762 --> 38:59.347
Just put your
signature on that.

38:59.389 --> 39:01.016
Ah, you can leave
that down there.

39:01.058 --> 39:02.517
You probably shouldn't
be coming up here

39:02.559 --> 39:04.519
because you're obviously
pretty stupid.

39:04.561 --> 39:07.105
Julian:
Yo, have a seat. And...

39:07.146 --> 39:08.815
That's great.
Thank you.

39:08.857 --> 39:10.400
I guess we'll just hand
this down there now.

39:10.441 --> 39:11.985
Is that cool?
What?

39:12.027 --> 39:14.153
Bubbles:
Julian, get the camera
fired up, please.

39:14.195 --> 39:16.447
All right, just a sec, man.
I'm getting the chairs
for the ladies.

39:16.489 --> 39:18.241
There you go.
Have a seat.

39:18.282 --> 39:20.243
If you were a guy,
would you be called
Corey or Trevor?

39:20.284 --> 39:22.203
(Audience laughter)

39:22.245 --> 39:24.247
This is, uh, this is
just water right here.
Just so you guys know.

39:24.288 --> 39:26.750
Ricky, they know
it's piss.
They've been here.

39:26.791 --> 39:28.793
Oh, yeah, I forgot
about that.

39:30.545 --> 39:32.672
What the fuck
are you wearing?
(Laughing)

39:32.714 --> 39:34.257
Just wait. I'm just
getting ready here.

39:34.298 --> 39:35.550
Holy shit, Bubs!

39:35.592 --> 39:37.260
I'm just getting
ready here, boys.

39:37.301 --> 39:38.845
How'd you grow
a mustache so fast?

39:38.887 --> 39:40.680
What?
That's fucking
awesome!

39:40.722 --> 39:42.640
No, just wait now.
I'm just getting...

39:42.682 --> 39:44.976
Bubs, look in
the camera, man.

39:45.018 --> 39:46.519
(Audience laughter)

39:46.561 --> 39:48.187
Julian:
That's awesome!

39:48.229 --> 39:49.606
Nice job, buddy.

39:49.647 --> 39:51.858
Okay, this is, uh,

39:51.900 --> 39:56.195
Bubbles' Hollywood ninja
movie audition tape.

39:56.237 --> 39:58.489
Um...
(Nervous laugh)

39:58.531 --> 40:01.284
TV... TV gameshow host
take one.

40:01.325 --> 40:03.202
Mark it.

40:03.244 --> 40:06.289

Hi, there!

40:41.992 --> 40:43.952
Welcome to "Are You Smarter
than a First Grader?"

40:43.994 --> 40:46.746
I'm your host,
Bubbles Foxworthy.

40:46.788 --> 40:48.957
We are filming on
location this evening

40:48.999 --> 40:51.334
in beautiful
Austin, Texas!

40:51.375 --> 40:52.543
Say hi to everybody!

40:52.585 --> 40:56.297
(Cheering)

40:57.799 --> 41:00.093
Austin, Texas
tonight, baby!

41:00.135 --> 41:01.469
Here we go!

41:01.511 --> 41:04.514
Let's see who we
are dealing with here

41:04.555 --> 41:05.974
this evening.

41:06.016 --> 41:07.934
All right!
What's your name?

41:07.976 --> 41:09.393
Erin Rae.

41:09.435 --> 41:12.147
Ohh!

41:12.189 --> 41:14.732
Was she ever excited about
her name, wasn't she?

41:14.774 --> 41:16.567
(Mocking)
"Erin Rae!"

41:16.609 --> 41:18.028
(Audience laughter)

41:18.069 --> 41:19.362
(Cackling)

41:19.403 --> 41:20.571
What's your name?

41:20.613 --> 41:22.615
Angie Malone.

41:22.657 --> 41:24.367
Okay, I didn't need to
know your last name.

41:24.408 --> 41:26.494
Now people are going
to be looking you
up on Facebook

41:26.536 --> 41:29.247
and stalking you.
(Audience laughter)

41:29.288 --> 41:30.957
And what's your...
what's your name?

41:30.999 --> 41:32.917
Alexis.
What is it?
Alexis.

41:32.959 --> 41:35.128
I heard you
the first time.

41:35.170 --> 41:37.172
(Giggle)

41:37.214 --> 41:38.715
Are you... tickly-wickly!

41:38.756 --> 41:40.466
(Audience laughter)

41:40.508 --> 41:41.926
Okay, here.

41:41.968 --> 41:44.428
So, here, you take
that, like that.

41:44.470 --> 41:47.140
You take that one there.

41:47.182 --> 41:49.017
And you take that.
I'm going to ask
some questions.

41:49.059 --> 41:50.894
When I do, just write
it down nice and big

41:50.935 --> 41:54.814
and hold it up for my
lovely assistant, Julian.

41:54.856 --> 41:56.733
Ricky:
What do you want
me to do, Bubs?

41:56.774 --> 41:58.442
And joining us

41:58.484 --> 42:01.238
from the Sunnyvale
Church School
of the Freedomerist,

42:01.279 --> 42:03.073
we have Ricky!

42:03.114 --> 42:06.367
Ricky, tell us a bit
about yourself.

42:06.409 --> 42:08.161
Well, I...
I don't know.

42:08.203 --> 42:10.121
I like to smoke
different things and...

42:10.163 --> 42:11.706
Bubs, I'm not
playing this.

42:11.748 --> 42:13.875
I've seen this on TV.
It's fucking hard, man!

42:13.917 --> 42:16.169
I'm just asking you
basic questions, Ricky.

42:16.211 --> 42:19.214
This is "Are You Smarter
than a <i> First Grader?"</i>

42:19.256 --> 42:22.508
So you should, if you're
going to start a school,

42:22.550 --> 42:25.511
you should be able to
do this, no problem.

42:25.553 --> 42:27.097
It better be fucking easy!

42:27.138 --> 42:29.182
All right, now,
let's get down

42:29.224 --> 42:31.309
Ricky:
Hold on a sec...
to the action.

42:31.350 --> 42:33.394
I'm going to sit in the
back, so I can cheat.

42:33.436 --> 42:34.896
Bubbles:
Ricky...
Hopefully...

42:34.938 --> 42:36.647
Hopefully you guys
aren't dumb as fuck.

42:36.689 --> 42:38.191
All right, are we all done?
Are we all set?

42:38.233 --> 42:40.985
Are we all done?
Are we all ready?

42:41.027 --> 42:43.196
Let's get right
to the action here
in Austin, Texas,

42:43.238 --> 42:45.489
with the first question
of the evening.

42:45.531 --> 42:46.866
(Audience cheering)
Here we go.

42:46.908 --> 42:48.618
The first question
of the evening

42:48.659 --> 42:50.369
is in the
category of...

42:50.411 --> 42:52.956
nature.

42:52.997 --> 42:55.792
The category is nature.

42:55.833 --> 42:58.711
It's kind of...
kind of a big one,
but all right.

42:58.753 --> 43:00.297
All right!

43:00.338 --> 43:03.466
The question,
ladies and gentleman, is,

43:03.507 --> 43:05.843
How many legs

43:05.885 --> 43:08.221
does a centipede have?

43:08.263 --> 43:09.597
Oh, I get it: cent.

43:09.639 --> 43:11.891
Centipede, centi-pillar.
All right.

43:11.933 --> 43:14.560
Centi-pillar, Rick?
The answer's in the name.

43:14.602 --> 43:16.062
Technically,
it is in the name

43:16.104 --> 43:18.397
but I will find it
fucking hard to believe

43:18.439 --> 43:19.899
if you speak Latin...

43:19.941 --> 43:21.276
(Audience laughter)

43:21.318 --> 43:24.695
seeing how you can
barely speak English.

43:24.737 --> 43:27.991
Okay, contestant
number one.

43:28.032 --> 43:30.618
She wrote... Hold it up
for Julian, please...

43:30.660 --> 43:32.620
100!

43:32.662 --> 43:34.998
(Audience cheering)
Ricky:
(Chuckling)

43:35.039 --> 43:37.583
(Laughing)
That's fucking awesome.

43:37.625 --> 43:39.460
Okay, contestant
number two.

43:39.502 --> 43:41.629
She wrote...

43:41.671 --> 43:44.715
100!

43:44.757 --> 43:48.386
And Mrs. Giggly-pants,

43:48.427 --> 43:50.054
She wrote...

43:50.096 --> 43:51.514
100 legs!

43:51.555 --> 43:52.974
Julian:
Nice.

43:53.016 --> 43:54.976
A clean sweep
here in Austin.

43:55.018 --> 43:57.395
They're... very smart
ladies here in Austin.

43:57.436 --> 43:59.730
Julian:
Holy fuck!
(Audience laughter)

43:59.772 --> 44:02.108
Ricky, to tie
the game.

44:02.150 --> 44:04.027
From the Church School
of the...

44:04.068 --> 44:06.154
what in the fuck is that?
Julian:
What the fuck is... ?

44:06.196 --> 44:08.948
Ricky:
Well, it's called a centipede,
centi-pillar, cent...

44:08.990 --> 44:10.741
(Audience laughter)

44:10.783 --> 44:14.120
It means a penny,
so that's one, right?

44:14.162 --> 44:15.663
"I is leg."

44:15.705 --> 44:18.124
Well, cent means one.
It's a penny.

44:18.166 --> 44:21.127
Yeah, Ricky, a cent
is a penny but...

44:21.169 --> 44:23.462
It's not called
a fucking dollar-pede
or hundred-pede.

44:23.504 --> 44:26.132
It's... Right?
Centipede, centi-pillars.

44:26.174 --> 44:28.009
What do you
mean, it's one?

44:28.051 --> 44:30.511
So you think a centipede
is a fucking leg
that's alive?

44:30.553 --> 44:33.056
That's got a cock?

44:33.097 --> 44:34.974
I thought that's what
my dad taught-ed me.

44:35.016 --> 44:36.309
I don't...
I don't know. It's...

44:36.351 --> 44:37.894
It's like a leg
when it gets born

44:37.935 --> 44:39.478
and then it goes
around and eats leaves

44:39.520 --> 44:41.314
and berries and shit.

44:41.356 --> 44:42.899
Goes into what's
called a co-coon

44:42.940 --> 44:44.734
and comes out as
either a buttermoth

44:44.775 --> 44:46.319
or a humming bat.

44:46.361 --> 44:48.279
A humming bat?

44:48.321 --> 44:49.947
What the fuck
is a humming bat?

44:49.989 --> 44:53.076
What the fuck
is a buttermoth?

44:53.117 --> 44:54.994
Boys, this is
simple science.

44:55.036 --> 44:58.581
You guys don't know
about any of this shit?

44:58.622 --> 45:00.166
Ricky, oh my God!

45:00.208 --> 45:02.543
What is the answer?
It is one, right?

45:02.585 --> 45:04.254
It's 100, Ricky!
It's 100!

45:04.295 --> 45:06.339
That's fucked!
How do you fit 100 legs

45:06.381 --> 45:07.882
on one of those
little fucking things?

45:07.924 --> 45:10.009
Call it a hundred-pede.
See, at my school,

45:10.051 --> 45:12.511
it'd be called
a hundred-pede
or a dollar-pede.

45:12.553 --> 45:14.097
It's a fucking
dumb name.

45:14.138 --> 45:15.890
Julian: (Scoffing)
It's a dumb name.

45:15.932 --> 45:17.225
(Whispering)
He's fucked. He's fucked.

45:17.267 --> 45:19.102
Julian:
Shit, we can't use that.

45:19.143 --> 45:20.853
We've got to start all over.
I know I can't use that.

45:20.895 --> 45:22.230
They'll put him in a
fucking insane asylum.

45:22.272 --> 45:24.065
Well, it's not
fucking grade one.

45:24.107 --> 45:25.649
That's grade seven
at least.

45:25.691 --> 45:28.986
Okay, let's try this again.
Let's go take two.

45:29.028 --> 45:32.240
Take two and mark it.
(Imitating clack of slate)

45:32.282 --> 45:34.033
Hi, there and welcome
to "Are You Smarter
than a First Grader?"

45:34.075 --> 45:37.036
(Slurring)
I'm your host,
Bubbles Foxworthy.

45:37.078 --> 45:39.622
shooting on location tonight
in beautiful Austin, Texas.

45:39.663 --> 45:41.416
Say hi, everybody! Whoo!

45:41.458 --> 45:44.001
(Cheering)

45:44.043 --> 45:45.920
Let's get right to
the first question.

45:45.962 --> 45:47.838
We did not already
ask a question

45:47.880 --> 45:50.467
that garnered fucking
ridiculous results

45:50.508 --> 45:52.009
from one of the players.

45:52.051 --> 45:54.637
Okay, this is
question number two

45:54.678 --> 45:56.847
in the category of...

45:56.889 --> 45:59.517
anatomy.

45:59.558 --> 46:01.227
Anatomy.
Ricky:
Bubs,

46:01.269 --> 46:03.687
I don't know fuck-all
about planets,
and moons, and...

46:03.729 --> 46:05.564
(Audience laughter)
stars and...

46:05.606 --> 46:08.192
asteroids.
No, I'm talking
about anatomy, Ricky.

46:08.234 --> 46:10.403
That's astronomy
you're referring to.

46:10.445 --> 46:12.238
What... What
does that mean?
Anatomy,

46:12.280 --> 46:15.616
like, you know,
like body and
bones and shit.

46:15.658 --> 46:17.118
Perfect example
of my school:

46:17.160 --> 46:19.162
call it fuckin',
"body, bones and shit."

46:19.203 --> 46:21.414
Instead of using
a big, dumb word.

46:21.456 --> 46:23.249
Ricky:
Fuck...

46:23.291 --> 46:25.084
(Whispering)
My God, he cannot be allowed

46:25.126 --> 46:27.670
to start this fucking school.
Julian:
No shit.

46:27.711 --> 46:29.547
He'll dumbify the planet.

46:29.588 --> 46:32.509
Okay, no, Ricky,
in the category of body...

46:32.550 --> 46:35.219
I heard... I heard that.
Just so you know.

46:35.261 --> 46:38.139
In the category of
body, bones and shit...

46:38.181 --> 46:39.974
Yes.

46:40.016 --> 46:41.934
The question is,

46:41.976 --> 46:44.479
How many bones

46:44.521 --> 46:47.064
in the human body?

46:47.106 --> 46:49.359
How many bones
in the human body?

46:49.400 --> 46:51.819
It's a bit of
trick question,
don't you think?

46:51.861 --> 46:53.446
A trick question?

46:53.488 --> 46:55.239
No, it's not
a trick question.

46:55.281 --> 46:56.949
You mean like how
many do I have now,

46:56.991 --> 46:58.617
or when I was bornt,
or when?

46:58.659 --> 47:00.453
(Audience laughter)

47:00.495 --> 47:02.205
Now, Ricky.
You're fucking...

47:02.246 --> 47:04.290
how many bones are
in there right now?

47:04.332 --> 47:05.791
I'll try to count
the fucking things.

47:05.833 --> 47:08.294
How much time
do we have here?

47:08.336 --> 47:10.838
(Sigh)
Unbelievable.
This is fucked.

47:10.880 --> 47:13.174
Okay! Contestant
number one,

47:13.216 --> 47:14.592
what was your
name again?

47:14.633 --> 47:16.469
Erin.
Erin what?

47:16.511 --> 47:19.930
Erin Rae.
(Cackling)

47:19.972 --> 47:22.433
Okay, Erin Rae!
Hold up for Julian.

47:22.475 --> 47:24.643
She said...

47:24.685 --> 47:28.606
(Audience cheering)

47:28.647 --> 47:32.943
420 bones.

47:32.985 --> 47:34.987
I'm hoping you're
trying to make a joke

47:35.029 --> 47:36.822
and that wasn't
your real answer,

47:36.864 --> 47:41.327
'cause if it is you
probably should call
a fucking ambulance.

47:41.369 --> 47:43.538
Okay, contestant
number two.

47:43.580 --> 47:45.122
She said...

47:45.164 --> 47:47.666
(Audience cheering)
420?

47:47.708 --> 47:49.001
Ricky:
Awesome.

47:49.043 --> 47:51.254
Am I fucking wrong here?
There's not 400...

47:51.295 --> 47:53.631
No, there' not 400...
Just fucking around.

47:53.672 --> 47:56.551
Okay, and
contestant three!

47:56.593 --> 47:59.178
She said...

47:59.220 --> 48:01.180
376.

48:02.890 --> 48:06.685
There is a lot of bones
going around down
here in Austin.

48:06.727 --> 48:08.354
Julian:
Jesus...

48:08.396 --> 48:10.356
Oh, wait, wait, wait!
The question was,

48:10.398 --> 48:11.941
"How many bones do you
have in your body?",

48:11.982 --> 48:14.193
not "How many bones
have been <i> in..."</i>

48:14.235 --> 48:17.196
(Audience laughing, shouting)
Bubbles:
(Cackling)

48:17.238 --> 48:18.781
I'm just teasing you!

48:18.822 --> 48:21.117
Teasy-weezies!
Just teasing!

48:21.158 --> 48:22.785
You fucking
gave me leg-up.

48:22.826 --> 48:25.580
I had to take a
fucking slam-dunk!

48:25.622 --> 48:27.540
I had to take it.
I'm just teasing you.

48:27.582 --> 48:30.376
You're probably not...
dirty like that.

48:30.418 --> 48:32.378
(Nervous giggle)
I've got to add these
fucking things up.

48:32.420 --> 48:34.713
What the fuck do you
have going on here?

48:34.755 --> 48:36.215
Ricky:
One, two, three, four...

48:36.257 --> 48:38.050
Julian:
That's got three
bones in it?

48:38.092 --> 48:39.843
Ricky:
Well, there's the shaft

48:39.885 --> 48:41.679
and the balls,
that's three.

48:41.720 --> 48:45.224
17, 19... 23...

48:45.266 --> 48:48.394
Ricky!
Six toes? Are
you kidding me?

48:50.062 --> 48:51.897
And "5-ish"
on one hand?

48:51.939 --> 48:53.899
What the fuck?
Do you see this shit?

48:53.941 --> 48:56.026
Yes, I see the
fucking thing!

48:56.068 --> 48:58.237
46.

48:58.279 --> 49:00.156
46!
(Laughing)
Ricky...

49:00.197 --> 49:02.783
46. There might be more,
but there's definitely 46.

49:02.825 --> 49:06.203
Bubbles: Ricky, you've got
four fucking ribs
centrally located.

49:06.245 --> 49:08.665
How many is... ?
You don't...
(Sigh)

49:08.706 --> 49:11.417
My God, I can't
explain this to you
right now, Ricky!

49:11.459 --> 49:14.920
Well, how many is it?
It's 206.

49:14.962 --> 49:17.298
Fuck off!

49:17.340 --> 49:20.259
Seriously? There's
206 bones under
all this shit?

49:20.301 --> 49:23.262
Yes, there's 206
fucking bones in there.

49:23.304 --> 49:24.763
I mean, I knew
when you were bornt,

49:24.805 --> 49:27.600
you started as a bone
and then it flossoms out.

49:27.642 --> 49:31.020
But... I didn't know it
flossomed out into 206.
That's fucking crazy!

49:31.061 --> 49:34.273
What do you mean
you start <i> as a bone?</i>

49:34.315 --> 49:37.109
Bubs, you do know about
life and stuff, right?

49:37.151 --> 49:38.528
Your parents
make a bone

49:38.569 --> 49:41.238
and that flossoms out
into what we become.

49:41.280 --> 49:43.115
So, when you're born,
you're just a bone?

49:43.157 --> 49:44.617
One bone?

49:44.659 --> 49:46.661
You're like a
fucking paint can?
You should...

49:46.703 --> 49:48.829
you should maybe
think about coming
to my fucking school

49:48.871 --> 49:50.789
if you didn't know that.

49:50.831 --> 49:53.292
You know what,
I can't use any
of this footage

49:53.334 --> 49:55.586
as my demo.
I mean, just...

49:55.628 --> 49:57.630
you're going to be
put in a home, Ricky,

49:57.672 --> 50:00.257
if I show that
to the producers
in Hollywood.

50:00.299 --> 50:01.967
We'll have to shoot
something else.

50:02.009 --> 50:04.928
I got that one wrong too?
Yes, Ricky,
you fucked it up.

50:04.970 --> 50:07.473
Let's hear it for
the ladies, everybody.
They did awesome!

50:07.515 --> 50:10.059
(Audience cheering)
Thanks for coming up.

50:10.100 --> 50:11.644
Thanks for coming up.

50:14.146 --> 50:15.314
That was unbelievable.

50:15.356 --> 50:17.316
Oh, you can keep
that if you want.

50:17.358 --> 50:19.652
Souvenir.
(Giggling)

50:19.694 --> 50:21.487
So, are we good?
Did you get your thing?

50:21.529 --> 50:23.239
No, Ricky...
Julian: No, he didn't
get his thing.

50:23.280 --> 50:24.741
That was
fucked, Ricky!

50:24.782 --> 50:26.283
Ricky:
Why?
<i>Why?</i>

50:26.325 --> 50:28.411
Because of them?
Ricky...

50:28.452 --> 50:30.580
"Buttermoths"?
"Humming bats"?

50:30.621 --> 50:32.665
I didn't hear you spitting
out fucking answers!
"Centi-pillars"?

50:32.707 --> 50:34.500
I was the camera guy.
I wasn't even
participating.

50:34.542 --> 50:36.335
I bet you didn't know
one fucking answer!

50:36.377 --> 50:38.295
I knew all the
fucking answers.
At least I got one of them.

50:38.337 --> 50:40.005
Look, man,
you know what?
What?

50:40.047 --> 50:42.174
It's time for you to
get some tough love.
No, it's not.

50:42.216 --> 50:44.510
Yes, it is.
Because I am getting
fucked up tonight

50:44.552 --> 50:46.512
and having fun here
in Austin. Don't
fucking ruin that!

50:46.554 --> 50:48.598
No, man. This whole
school thing...
Don't be a dick.

50:48.639 --> 50:50.641
No, you're going to
get some tough love.
It's going down right now.

50:50.683 --> 50:52.685
You're kidding me? You want to
do this right now?
Yeah.

50:52.727 --> 50:54.270
You know what?
Fuck it! Go ahead.

50:54.311 --> 50:56.355
Do you still want
to start a school?
Yes...

50:56.397 --> 50:58.148
Well, you're getting
tough love, then.

50:58.190 --> 51:00.234
Rick, you know you're
one of my best friends.

51:00.276 --> 51:03.028
We're like
brothers, right?
For now, yeah.

51:03.070 --> 51:04.447
And what I'm about
to say right now

51:04.488 --> 51:06.031
is going to hurt
for a little bit

51:06.073 --> 51:07.991
but then it's
going to be okay.

51:08.033 --> 51:09.493
All right?
We'll see.

51:09.535 --> 51:11.746
But you're way
too fucking stupid

51:11.788 --> 51:14.039
to start a school.

51:14.081 --> 51:16.500
Is that right? That's what
you fucking think?
'Cause that's what I know.

51:16.542 --> 51:18.544
Well, it's not
true and...
It is true.

51:18.586 --> 51:20.546
Do you guys think
I'm too stupid to
start a school?

51:20.588 --> 51:22.548
Julian:
Yes!
(Mixed shouts)

51:22.590 --> 51:24.383
Are you kidding me?
Okay, well.

51:24.425 --> 51:26.093
I didn't realize
everybody felt like that.
Bubs,

51:26.135 --> 51:28.137
you've got to help
me out here. Give him
some tough love.

51:28.178 --> 51:30.347
He's saying I'm
too fucking stupid
to start a school.

51:30.389 --> 51:32.558
Is that what
you think too?
Julian, why would you...

51:32.600 --> 51:34.644
A lot of people here
sort of agreed.

51:34.685 --> 51:37.062
He would've been going on
about this school for
the rest of the night.

51:37.104 --> 51:38.815
You didn't have to
say that! I mean,

51:38.856 --> 51:40.691
that's not the
way I would have
said it, Ricky.

51:40.733 --> 51:43.902
I mean, you maybe
aren't smart enough

51:43.944 --> 51:46.739
to start a school,
but that doesn't
mean anything.

51:46.781 --> 51:49.074
I mean, you've got
to be really smart
to start a school.

51:49.116 --> 51:50.576
I mean, come on.
Yeah?

51:50.618 --> 51:52.202
And that might not
just be your thing,

51:52.244 --> 51:54.079
you know, but you're
good at other things.

51:54.121 --> 51:55.914
Yeah, I see where
this is going.

51:55.956 --> 51:58.668
You're excellent
at other things,
like tying your shoes.

51:58.709 --> 52:01.295
Who can tie a better...
double looped than you?

52:01.337 --> 52:02.921
Yeah, I see what you
guys are saying here.

52:02.963 --> 52:05.048
Who makes a better
peanut butter sandwich?

52:05.090 --> 52:06.759
Who gives a fuck?

52:06.801 --> 52:08.886
I see what you guys
are saying, okay?

52:08.927 --> 52:11.388
Guess what? If I'm
too stupid to start
my school and retire,

52:11.430 --> 52:13.516
maybe I'm too fucking
stupid to be here.
Is that what you mean?

52:13.557 --> 52:15.518
No, no, no,
no, no.
Oh, no!

52:15.559 --> 52:17.603
I'm obviously too
fucking dumb to be
here with the big...

52:17.645 --> 52:19.730
We're not saying that.
smart-iest Julian

52:19.772 --> 52:22.107
and "Hey, I'm smart
as fuck" Bubbles.
So, guess what, boys?

52:22.149 --> 52:23.942
I'm done.
No...

52:23.984 --> 52:25.903
Go out there, get some
fucking food. Hopefully
they have popcorn.

52:25.944 --> 52:27.613
Get some liquor drinks,
smoke some dope

52:27.655 --> 52:29.824
and go the fuck to jail
here in Austin.

52:29.866 --> 52:31.659
You're not going
to go to jail!
Fuck you guys!

52:31.701 --> 52:33.536
This is fucking
bullshit.

52:33.577 --> 52:35.538
Ricky, you're acting
like a big fucking
baby right now.

52:35.579 --> 52:37.373
Ricky:
You've got popcorn? Awesome.

52:37.414 --> 52:39.249
I'm getting some right
now. How's it going?

52:39.291 --> 52:40.877
Bubbles:
Ricky!
Nice to see all you guys.

52:40.918 --> 52:43.086
Sorry that Julian
and Bubbles fucked
everything up

52:43.128 --> 52:44.505
and I got to fucking leave!

52:44.547 --> 52:47.132
I had to tell him, man.
Ricky:
...cock-suckers!

52:47.174 --> 52:49.259
Right on. Where the fuck
is the popcorn at?

52:49.301 --> 52:51.679
How are you?
Bubbles:
Ricky, can you at least

52:51.721 --> 52:53.472
turn your fucking
microphone off...
Fuck off!

52:53.514 --> 52:55.474
...if you're leaving?

52:55.516 --> 52:57.476
I can't wait in fucking line.
Look, I'll pay you back.

52:57.518 --> 52:59.144
I need some fucking popcorn,

52:59.186 --> 53:01.689
and some liquor drinks
would be awesome.

53:01.731 --> 53:04.149
What have you guys got?
You guys got any
liquor drinks over here?

53:04.191 --> 53:05.860
Ricky, turn off
your mike!

53:05.902 --> 53:07.444
What the fuck is this?

53:07.486 --> 53:09.321
Bubbles:
He's out in the goddam lobby.

53:09.363 --> 53:10.989
That's my
fucking bookel.

53:11.031 --> 53:12.449
Where the fuck
did you get that?

53:12.491 --> 53:14.993
It's 15 bucks, bud.
You can go
fuck yourself!

53:15.035 --> 53:16.995
This is fucking bullshit.
What's he talking about?

53:17.037 --> 53:19.832
This isn't going
to be good, man.
Ricky: What the fuck?

53:19.874 --> 53:21.542
Ricky:
Julian?
What?

53:21.584 --> 53:24.169
You are fucking
dead, my friend.
Why?

53:24.211 --> 53:25.838
What the fuck is this
doing out there?

53:25.880 --> 53:28.173
I'm selling it.
You're selling it?

53:28.215 --> 53:29.592
It's my fucking bookel!

53:29.633 --> 53:31.343
Julian:
Does it look like
people are buying them?

53:31.385 --> 53:33.095
I don't fucking know.

53:33.136 --> 53:35.639
I know there's a lot
of fucking lunatics
here, let me tell you.

53:35.681 --> 53:37.975
Julian:
I'll cut you in, man.
Don't worry about it.

53:38.016 --> 53:40.519
This is the fucking
lowest thing you've
ever done to me, man.

53:40.561 --> 53:42.563
What, man?
You took my private shit,

53:42.605 --> 53:44.565
brought it here,
and now it's out
there for sale?

53:44.607 --> 53:46.275
Yeah.
You're fucked.
It's not even done.

53:46.316 --> 53:48.694
No, it's incredible,
man. It's fine
just the way it is.

53:48.736 --> 53:50.487
It's called
"Everything I Know"

53:50.529 --> 53:52.489
and it's only,
like, a tiny, tiny
bit of shit I know.

53:52.531 --> 53:54.032
Bubbles, grab it.

53:54.074 --> 53:55.492
Don't.
Ricky, just...

53:55.534 --> 53:57.494
What's... Look, there's
a bug in your popcorn.

53:57.536 --> 53:59.830
A bug?
(Cackling)

53:59.872 --> 54:02.040
Is there a bug
in here for real?
No. I was just...

54:02.082 --> 54:04.585
Give me that back.
Distraction scenario.
Just...

54:04.627 --> 54:06.336
It's my personal...
I'm going to look at it.

54:06.378 --> 54:08.171
Let me assess
the situation.
Bubbles,

54:08.213 --> 54:10.549
that's my personal
fucking thing.
Ricky, Ricky...

54:10.591 --> 54:11.968
What?
Ricky, Ricky...

54:12.009 --> 54:14.762
(Hissing)

54:14.804 --> 54:17.598
Fuck off! You know
I hate snakes.

54:17.640 --> 54:19.433
Just give me that.
I'm going to leave.

54:19.475 --> 54:21.226
You guys can do
your little smart
fucking games

54:21.268 --> 54:22.561
or whatever you're
going to do.

54:22.603 --> 54:24.187
(Imitating snake bite)
Ah, fuck off!

54:24.229 --> 54:25.606
(Audience laughter)

54:25.648 --> 54:27.524
It's a fucking
Texas rattler.

54:27.566 --> 54:29.401
It's a cobra rattler.

54:29.443 --> 54:31.904
It's a bad one.
(Hissing)

54:31.946 --> 54:34.281
Okay, okay. Fuck off
with the snake shit!

54:34.323 --> 54:36.116
(Continued hissing)
But I'm serious,

54:36.158 --> 54:37.910
you guys have already
given me enough
in embarrassents,

54:37.952 --> 54:39.328
don't fucking
make it worse.
Just let me have

54:39.369 --> 54:40.746
a fucking look
at it, Ricky.

54:40.788 --> 54:43.040
It can't be that bad.
It is fucked up, Bubs.

54:43.081 --> 54:44.959
Bubbles:
"Everything I Know".

54:45.001 --> 54:47.169
Ricky:
It's not everything I know.
It's a tiny bit of shit.

54:47.210 --> 54:49.880
Bubbles:
"Bye Ricky".

54:49.922 --> 54:52.758
This should be good.
Fucking dicks!
Should be good.

54:52.800 --> 54:54.426
Ricky:
I don't even remember
what's in here, actually.

54:54.468 --> 54:56.637
Bubbles:
Look at these pictures...

54:56.679 --> 54:58.514
Julian:
This is a good one, man.

54:58.555 --> 55:00.516
Bubbles:
Look at this, he's got a...

55:00.557 --> 55:05.062
"crokodile", or a "aligatore"
and a "crokodile".

55:05.103 --> 55:07.606
And then it says, "Same."

55:07.648 --> 55:09.399
(Chuckling)
Well,

55:09.441 --> 55:10.776
they are kind
of the same.

55:10.818 --> 55:12.402
Let's see what
he's got here.

55:12.444 --> 55:15.197
"Aligatores and
croko-deelies

55:15.238 --> 55:17.616
both look the same
but are different.

55:17.658 --> 55:20.452
I don't know
why and I don't
give a fuck."

55:20.494 --> 55:22.079
(Audience laughter)

55:22.120 --> 55:24.040
Well, to me it's...
one of those things

55:24.081 --> 55:26.083
where school wastes
your fucking brain space

55:26.124 --> 55:28.335
with why they're
different. I mean,
they do look the same.

55:28.377 --> 55:30.420
When one of them's
coming at you, it's about
to snap your cock off,

55:30.462 --> 55:31.797
you're not looking
at it going,

55:31.839 --> 55:33.799
"Are you a croko-dilly
or an aligatore?"

55:33.841 --> 55:36.844
No, you don't
give a fuck!
(Audience laughter)

55:36.886 --> 55:39.137
Bubbles:
God, look at this one.
"Garbage in water".

55:39.179 --> 55:41.306
There he is, look, firing
his garbage into the...

55:41.348 --> 55:44.560
Well, everybody should
be taught this to save
the fucking earth.

55:44.601 --> 55:48.438
"If you throw
your garbag in
the water lake,

55:48.480 --> 55:51.483
"water ocean
or water river,

55:51.525 --> 55:54.111
"the earth will make it
part of it again.

55:54.152 --> 55:55.612
I forget what
it's called."

55:55.654 --> 55:57.406
(Mixed laughter)
Right.

55:57.447 --> 56:01.410
So you're teaching
people to fucking fire
garbage into the lake?

56:01.451 --> 56:03.412
It's better
than going into
a landfill, isn't it?

56:03.453 --> 56:05.873
Like, we've got to start
thinking about the Earth
No, it's not!

56:05.915 --> 56:08.584
for our kids, and
I've got a gram-child
on the way, so...

56:08.625 --> 56:11.211
Oh, my God...
Holy fuck, Ricky.

56:11.253 --> 56:13.338
Ricky: Give me that.
Bubbles: Wait, look at this.

56:13.380 --> 56:15.674
Everybody needs to
know this, right here.

56:15.716 --> 56:17.676
"You can take gum
out of your hair

56:17.718 --> 56:20.470
with peanut butter toast."
That is true.

56:20.512 --> 56:22.681
I could teach that
at my school. 'Cause not
everybody knows that.

56:22.723 --> 56:24.683
When you get gum
in your hair, wasted,

56:24.725 --> 56:27.061
and you don't know how
the fuck to get it out,
you use peanut butter.

56:27.103 --> 56:30.564
I never knew you can't
turn rocks into lava
on your stove either.

56:30.606 --> 56:33.692
Well, that's one of
the things when you're
trying to start a school:

56:33.734 --> 56:36.112
you do experiments
and stuff.

56:36.153 --> 56:39.156
Ricky... Anyway, on my stove,
I couldn't do it.
I tried but...

56:39.197 --> 56:40.783
Ricky...
Boys, you know what?

56:40.824 --> 56:42.367
Give me more embarrasses.
I don't give a fuck.

56:42.409 --> 56:44.202
'Cause my life's
pretty much perfect.

56:44.244 --> 56:46.747
(Audience cheering)
Julian:
Your life's perfect?

56:46.789 --> 56:48.832
I don't have a lot of
money but I would say

56:48.874 --> 56:51.251
that this is the
happiest I've been in
a long fucking time.

56:51.293 --> 56:52.878
Ricky...
What?

56:52.920 --> 56:55.714
Don't make me call
bullshit on you, bud.

56:55.756 --> 56:58.550
What are you going
to do now? Give me
more embarrassents?

56:58.592 --> 57:01.095
Oh, you know, Ricky,
it's like this:

57:01.137 --> 57:04.514
it would have
been nice to get
my demo shot by now

57:04.556 --> 57:06.767
and nobody seems
to be helping me.

57:06.809 --> 57:08.769
So that's when

fucking show tonight?
He was at the show, man!

01:06:11.728 --> 01:06:14.147
That's not good, Bubs.
So he saw you fuck
everything up.

01:06:14.189 --> 01:06:16.107
(Sigh)
Ricky...

01:06:16.149 --> 01:06:18.109
Well, you
fucked up a lot.
Ricky!

01:06:18.151 --> 01:06:20.529
Mr. Troyer,
I'm very sorry.

01:06:20.570 --> 01:06:22.864
I had a perfectly
nice demo

01:06:22.905 --> 01:06:24.907
all put together,
I was going to
hand-deliver it to you

01:06:24.949 --> 01:06:28.036
and these guys made
fun of it, so I thought
I had to shoot a new one

01:06:28.077 --> 01:06:29.454
and that's what
I tried to do

01:06:29.496 --> 01:06:32.290
and things got all
fucked up and I'm sorry.

01:06:32.332 --> 01:06:34.959
I know things didn't go
as well as you planned,

01:06:35.001 --> 01:06:37.086
but what I saw out there

01:06:37.128 --> 01:06:39.214
was determination, passion,

01:06:39.255 --> 01:06:41.466
Ricky:
Thank you.
and that's more important

01:06:41.508 --> 01:06:43.176
than any demo you
could have shown me.

01:06:43.218 --> 01:06:44.636
(Whispering)
Passion!

01:06:44.678 --> 01:06:46.596
Okay, so what are
you saying, then?

01:06:46.638 --> 01:06:50.016
Well, I'd like to offer you
a role in "Micro Ninja".

01:06:50.058 --> 01:06:51.851
Oh, right on!

01:06:51.893 --> 01:06:53.645
(Indistinct)
Are you serious?

01:06:53.687 --> 01:06:55.980
You can just put me in
the movie just like that?

01:06:56.022 --> 01:06:58.149
Yeah. It's my
fucking movie.

01:06:58.191 --> 01:06:59.942
See, told you.
My God, boys,

01:06:59.984 --> 01:07:02.487
I'm going to be in a
Hollywood ninja movie!
Thanks to me.

01:07:02.529 --> 01:07:04.822
(Giggle)
I'm going to be in it!

01:07:04.864 --> 01:07:06.658
You know, actually,

01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:09.244
I'd like to get all
three of you guys,
if that's okay.

01:07:09.285 --> 01:07:10.995
Fuck!
Oh, they're not
interested...

01:07:11.037 --> 01:07:12.497
No, no, let's do it!
That's awesome.

01:07:12.539 --> 01:07:14.332
No, no, just a second.
I'd love to be a ninji.

01:07:14.374 --> 01:07:16.167
Just hang on here.
What?

01:07:16.209 --> 01:07:18.336
Are we going to get
paid for this?
Of course.

01:07:18.378 --> 01:07:20.338
What do I look like?
Some kind of asshole?

01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:22.340
No, man, no.
You pay us, I'm in.
I'm there.

01:07:22.382 --> 01:07:25.468
Boys, just hang on!
I'm the only one that
was actually interested...

01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:28.346
No, no. He said
all of us, Bubs.
All of us.

01:07:28.388 --> 01:07:30.515
Well, that's not fair.

01:07:30.557 --> 01:07:32.559
It's cool.
Don't worry.

01:07:32.601 --> 01:07:34.728
I'll make sure
you're the only one
with the nunchucks.

01:07:34.770 --> 01:07:36.938
See, there you go.
That's not really fair.
Okay.

01:07:36.979 --> 01:07:39.357
Okay, I'll be...
Okay, I'm the
nunchuck ninja.

01:07:39.399 --> 01:07:41.401
I should have
a handgun.

01:07:41.443 --> 01:07:43.027
It's a ninja
movie, though.

01:07:43.069 --> 01:07:45.321
You just can't...
Ninjas don't
have guns, dummy.

01:07:45.363 --> 01:07:46.989
You got any
smokes on you?

01:07:47.031 --> 01:07:49.033
Uh, I don't smoke.
Freakin' out.

01:07:49.075 --> 01:07:51.411
I mean, I started
when I was two,
and look what happened.

01:07:51.453 --> 01:07:54.581
(Giggling)
Boys! I'm freaking out!

01:07:54.623 --> 01:07:56.958
I'm going to be in a
Hollywood ninja movie!

01:07:56.999 --> 01:07:59.961
(Cackling,
grunting excitedly)

01:08:03.632 --> 01:08:05.842
Great shift
there, girls.
(Giggling)

01:08:05.883 --> 01:08:08.219
That was some
excellent screwing
we did there, eh?

01:08:08.261 --> 01:08:10.388
(Laughter)
Eh?

01:08:13.099 --> 01:08:15.393
It's fun having sex.

01:08:15.435 --> 01:08:19.147
I like your big
American balls.

01:08:19.188 --> 01:08:21.399
Canadian balls.
(Giggling)

01:08:21.441 --> 01:08:23.401
And yours
are nice too.
Ooh!

01:08:23.443 --> 01:08:25.361
(Chuckling)
Both:
Bye.

01:08:25.403 --> 01:08:27.947
It was fun...
having sex.

01:08:39.207 --> 01:08:40.877
(Cup clinking)

01:08:42.671 --> 01:08:44.840
Now you die!
(Scream)
(Blowing)

01:08:44.881 --> 01:08:47.049
Ahh!

01:08:47.091 --> 01:08:49.344
Don't hurt me.
I don't want to die.

01:08:49.385 --> 01:08:50.928
You must!
(Martial Arts yell)

01:08:50.970 --> 01:08:52.388
Micro ninjas!

01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:53.890
Bubbles:
Ahh! You dirty bitch!

01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:56.685
Ricky: (Grunting)
Motherfucking cocks
in my ass! Fuck!

01:08:56.725 --> 01:08:59.770
Bubbles: Ricky!
Man: Cut! Cut!

01:08:59.813 --> 01:09:02.482
Jesus fucking Christ!
What's going on here?

01:09:03.733 --> 01:09:06.068
What the fuck is
going on here, hm?

01:09:06.109 --> 01:09:07.612
What the fuck is
going on here?

01:09:07.654 --> 01:09:09.531
Tom:
Yeah, what the
fuck is going on?

01:09:09.572 --> 01:09:12.033
Ricky:
We're making a movie.
We are?

01:09:12.073 --> 01:09:13.660
What the fuck
is going on?

01:09:13.702 --> 01:09:15.662
I thought that
take was perfect.

01:09:15.703 --> 01:09:17.622
Ricky:
Yeah.

01:09:17.663 --> 01:09:19.791
Oh, I'm sorry, yeah,
you're right, that was,
it was perfect,

01:09:19.832 --> 01:09:22.292
it was fucking ideal,
it was...
Yeah, so why'd you cut?

01:09:22.335 --> 01:09:24.462
Because it was
fucking awful!

01:09:24.504 --> 01:09:26.296
Hang on a second.

01:09:26.339 --> 01:09:28.256
I'm talking to
him right now.
Yeah.

01:09:28.299 --> 01:09:29.801
What are you, 6'2"?
Something like that?

01:09:29.843 --> 01:09:31.803
I don't know.
Yeah, come here.
Look at that.

01:09:31.845 --> 01:09:34.805
There's camera
right there, okay?
You're right here.

01:09:34.848 --> 01:09:37.308
The thing's called
"Micro Ninja", right?

01:09:37.350 --> 01:09:39.143
It's not called
"Hide the Fucking Midget".

01:09:39.185 --> 01:09:41.770
I see your back
and the back of
your fucking head.

01:09:41.813 --> 01:09:44.482
He's the size of
a fucking football.
Could you please clear?

01:09:44.524 --> 01:09:47.359
Otherwise it looks
like you're swinging a
fucking pan at the air!

01:09:47.402 --> 01:09:49.987
I'm so...
I'm so stupid!

01:09:50.029 --> 01:09:52.448
I'm sorry.
Anyway...

01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:54.325
And what's
the fucking deal
with you guys,

01:09:54.367 --> 01:09:56.160
with the fucking
joint and the
whisky and shit?

01:09:56.202 --> 01:09:57.829
Verne:
I told them to keep that.

01:09:57.871 --> 01:09:59.748
You did?
Yeah!
Ohh!

01:09:59.789 --> 01:10:01.833
That's a brilliant
fucking idea!

01:10:01.875 --> 01:10:03.835
You understand
that a ninja
means stealth.

01:10:03.877 --> 01:10:05.837
You're supposed
to sneak in.
Bubbles: Yes.

01:10:05.879 --> 01:10:07.756
That's why you got
the black clothes...
See? Right?

01:10:07.797 --> 01:10:10.007
Bubbles understands.
Julian:
I'm not losing my drink.

01:10:10.049 --> 01:10:12.134
Ricky: No, I don't think I like
your fucking attitude. You
don't?

01:10:12.176 --> 01:10:14.387
Read our fucking contracts.
You don't like my
fucking attitude, huh?

01:10:14.429 --> 01:10:15.889
Get rid of the
fucking joint!

01:10:15.931 --> 01:10:18.140
Julian:
Hey, hey, hey...
If you're gonna...

01:10:18.182 --> 01:10:20.059
Set the fucking drink down!
I'm not setting
the fucking drink down.

01:10:20.101 --> 01:10:21.978
What the fuck, Verne?
Yes... well, then,
walk over there

01:10:22.019 --> 01:10:24.021
and sit down and
fucking make some
food for something!

01:10:24.063 --> 01:10:25.523
Read my fucking
contract.

01:10:25.565 --> 01:10:27.483
Anyway, clear the...
Hey, Mr. Thornton!
Yes, what?

01:10:27.525 --> 01:10:29.318
Why don't you
get back there,
and roll the cameras,

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.028
and we'll get
this over with.

01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:32.530
And then I'll
fire your ass.

01:10:32.572 --> 01:10:35.157
(Incredulous laugh)
Really?

01:10:35.199 --> 01:10:37.702
Really.
Okay. All right, then.

01:10:37.744 --> 01:10:40.037
So I'm just supposed
to sit over there
like a fucking idiot

01:10:40.079 --> 01:10:42.123
and just, like, eat
celery sticks and shit

01:10:42.164 --> 01:10:44.709
while you direct the movie? You
want to do that?
Why not?

01:10:44.751 --> 01:10:46.836
It'll probably go
a lot fucking better.
Really?

01:10:46.878 --> 01:10:49.046
Yeah!
Well, you should have
done that to start with.

01:10:49.088 --> 01:10:50.465
I guess
I should have!

01:10:50.506 --> 01:10:52.216
I mean, these fucking...
I mean, look at them...

01:10:52.258 --> 01:10:53.927
Where did you even
find these fucking guys?

01:10:53.969 --> 01:10:55.177
They're my friends.

01:10:55.219 --> 01:10:56.763
They're your fucking
friends, huh?

01:10:56.805 --> 01:10:58.598
(Mixed shouting)

01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:00.683
God damn it!
You son of a bitch!

01:11:00.725 --> 01:11:02.518
Touch the boss again
and you're gonna
get fucking pounded.

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.353
Yeah? You shut up
Fuck you.

01:11:04.395 --> 01:11:05.981
or I'm gonna put
the fucking boss
up your ass.

01:11:06.022 --> 01:11:07.565
You understand me?
Anyway,

01:11:07.607 --> 01:11:09.275
do you want to
do this fucking
thing or what?

01:11:09.317 --> 01:11:10.944
Verne:
Yes.
Yes? Okay.

01:11:10.986 --> 01:11:12.946
Well, get your
little ass over here.

01:11:12.988 --> 01:11:15.865
You stay the fuck
out of his way.
And you guys...

01:11:15.907 --> 01:11:18.242
I said, put the
<i>fucking</i> drink down!
(Ice clattering)

01:11:18.284 --> 01:11:20.077
You fucking kidding me?
(Mixed shouting)

01:11:20.119 --> 01:11:22.163
No, I'm not fucking...
Who the fuck do
you think you are?

01:11:22.204 --> 01:11:24.499
Is there a prop person...
Give me my fucking
glass back!

01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:26.709
Really?
Yeah!
Julian, just calm down.

01:11:26.751 --> 01:11:28.878
Want to read through
my fucking contract?
It says I can have this.

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:31.172
You've got a contract?
I've got a fucking
contract.

01:11:31.213 --> 01:11:32.674
That's
a fucking laugh!

01:11:32.715 --> 01:11:34.759
Okay. All right.
Are we good here?

01:11:34.801 --> 01:11:36.678
Are we good here?
That's perfect.
Oh yeah, we're great!

01:11:36.719 --> 01:11:38.387
Get a liquorman
over here...

01:11:38.429 --> 01:11:39.931
So the big
fucking ninjas,

01:11:39.973 --> 01:11:41.641
they stalk in here,
they fall down,

01:11:41.683 --> 01:11:43.601
they smoke their
joint and everything,

01:11:43.643 --> 01:11:45.436
and nobody'll
ever even fucking
know you were here.

01:11:45.478 --> 01:11:46.938
Let's try it that way.

01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:49.858
Patsy, get my fucking
pills in the car ready.

01:11:49.899 --> 01:11:52.027
You shove this up
your ass, okay?

01:11:52.068 --> 01:11:54.111
Fuck you.
Go ahead and d...
(Laugh)

01:11:54.153 --> 01:11:55.613
Yeah.
Okay.

01:11:55.655 --> 01:11:57.490
Did I stutter,
you fucking prick?

01:11:57.532 --> 01:12:00.159
Lick my balls,
you nut.

01:12:00.201 --> 01:12:01.661
(Whispering)
Oh, God damn it.

01:12:01.703 --> 01:12:04.622
Yeah.
Oh, fuck, I'd...
Just take a swing.

01:12:04.664 --> 01:12:06.791
Just once, man.
Don't... don't now.

01:12:06.833 --> 01:12:09.293
How'd you like to be
a 62-yard field goal?

01:12:09.335 --> 01:12:11.754
Huh? Would you
like that?

01:12:11.796 --> 01:12:13.673
Bubbles: Just...
You hear what
he's saying?

01:12:13.715 --> 01:12:16.551
Maybe everybody just
needs to take a fucking
deep breath and...

01:12:16.592 --> 01:12:18.970
Ricky:
Thinks he's so
fucking big!

01:12:19.012 --> 01:12:20.304
Bubbles:
Ricky!
What?

01:12:20.346 --> 01:12:21.806
Shut the fuck...
No, fuck you idiots!

01:12:21.848 --> 01:12:23.808
Just... go ahead,
do what you want to do.

01:12:23.850 --> 01:12:26.561
I'm going to lunch.
Ricky:
Billy Bong.

01:12:26.602 --> 01:12:28.479
Verne:
Why don't you just
keep walking?

01:12:28.521 --> 01:12:30.065
We don't need you.

01:12:30.106 --> 01:12:31.941
We're good.

01:12:31.983 --> 01:12:35.236
We'll do some more
with Steven Spielberg.
It'll be so much better.

01:12:35.277 --> 01:12:38.489
Billy Bob: Steven fucking Seagal
wouldn't direct
this piece of shit!

01:12:38.531 --> 01:12:40.825
Verne:
Oh, fuck you!
Let alone Steven Spielberg!

01:12:40.867 --> 01:12:42.994
Fat bitch!
Ricky:
Fucking dick.

01:12:43.036 --> 01:12:45.204
Bubbles:
Let's just go have
a liquor drink.

01:12:45.246 --> 01:12:47.040
Calm the fuck down.
I wanted...

01:12:47.082 --> 01:12:48.958
can we get a liquorman
over here, please?

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.168
I need another fucking drink.
I gotta go roll
a new joint.

01:12:51.210 --> 01:12:54.005
This one's
fucking soaked.
Fuck's sakes!

01:12:54.047 --> 01:12:56.382
I fucking told you
Billy Bob was going
to be a dick.

01:12:56.424 --> 01:12:58.676
He's not a dick.
He's just crazy.
