00:01.210 --> 00:02.751
Gordon:<i> Previously on</i>
<i> "masterchef"...</i>

00:02.795 --> 00:04.795
Let's go, people! Let's go!

00:04.839 --> 00:08.090
- I'm freaking out.
- Stop the clock!

00:08.134 --> 00:09.591
Your main course isn't enough.

00:09.635 --> 00:11.635
We want to see a dessert!

00:11.679 --> 00:13.137
Is this a joke?

00:13.180 --> 00:14.930
Dorian,
you bring home cooking
to another level.

00:14.974 --> 00:16.807
- Thank you.
- Sarah, it's fireworks.

00:16.851 --> 00:18.100
- Perfection.
- Thank you so much.

00:18.144 --> 00:19.852
Wuta, this does not
look appealing.

00:19.895 --> 00:21.353
A little disappointing,
I have to say.

00:21.397 --> 00:23.647
For the first time,
I feel embarrassed.

00:23.691 --> 00:26.275
Keturah,
it reminds me of season one
of "masterchef junior."

00:26.318 --> 00:27.735
the person leaving
"masterchef"

00:27.778 --> 00:30.779
is keturah.

00:30.823 --> 00:32.114
- Bye!
- Bye, keturah.

00:32.158 --> 00:34.825
<i> Tonight,</i>
<i> the home cooks take on</i>

00:34.869 --> 00:37.036
<i> an immunity challenge</i>
<i> fit for a king.</i>

00:37.079 --> 00:39.121
Gordon: Humongous
alaskan king crab.

00:39.165 --> 00:42.416
<i> And the pressure is on</i>
<i> to impress a legendary guest.</i>

00:42.460 --> 00:45.419
- Gordon: Chef morimoto!
- Oh, my gosh.

00:45.463 --> 00:49.590
It's definitely
intimidating a little bit,
cooking for morimoto.

00:49.633 --> 00:52.217
- Here we go.
- Joe: Where's the rest
of the pasta?

00:52.261 --> 00:54.553
- I threw it away. I was pissed.
-<i> Only the top cooks</i>

00:54.597 --> 00:56.305
<i> will claw their way</i>
<i> to the balcony...</i>

00:56.348 --> 00:58.265
One of your best dishes ever.

00:58.309 --> 01:00.017
<i> ...And be safe</i>
<i> from elimination.</i>

01:00.061 --> 01:03.145
We are handing out immunity
to not one,

01:03.189 --> 01:04.980
but three of you.

01:05.024 --> 01:07.066
The home cook who made this
winning dish

01:07.109 --> 01:09.443
will receive a special surprise.

01:09.487 --> 01:11.487
Fred:<i> Oh, lord.</i>

01:16.243 --> 01:18.243
<i> ( music playing )</i>

01:21.999 --> 01:23.957
whoo!

01:24.001 --> 01:25.918
Please make your way down.

01:25.961 --> 01:26.960
Wuta:<i> I'm still here.</i>

01:27.004 --> 01:29.171
<i> As a struggling reader,</i>

01:29.215 --> 01:31.423
I was told that I wouldn't be
good at anything.

01:31.467 --> 01:33.926
But I used that as fuel.

01:33.969 --> 01:36.470
Each day I come in
this kitchen to learn.

01:36.514 --> 01:38.514
- Here we go, top 13.
- There's nothing
in front of us...

01:38.557 --> 01:40.265
Top 13, and I'm feeling good.

01:40.309 --> 01:43.519
<i> Another chance to fight</i>
<i> for immunity, and I want it.</i>

01:43.562 --> 01:46.555
Immunity is the first step
to getting me to top ten.

01:46.565 --> 01:49.566
Welcome. We are halfway
to the finale.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.568
- All: Yes, chef.
- You should feel lucky

01:51.612 --> 01:53.070
to have made it this far

01:53.114 --> 01:55.114
because this has been
the most exciting,

01:55.157 --> 01:58.951
the most unpredictable,
and the most epic season ever.

01:58.994 --> 02:02.538
Sarah, top 13, where do you
see yourself going?

02:02.581 --> 02:05.457
Next step is top 10
and all the way to the finale.

02:05.501 --> 02:07.033
Mm-hmm.

02:07.044 --> 02:09.461
Fred, because
you've gained immunity

02:09.505 --> 02:11.213
across the last few weeks,

02:11.257 --> 02:13.340
it's almost like we haven't
seen you cook enough.

02:13.384 --> 02:14.550
- Yes, chef.
- You ready to get
your hands dirty?

02:14.593 --> 02:15.884
I'm absolutely ready.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.553
I'm excited for
whatever today holds.

02:17.596 --> 02:19.513
I can't wait to show you guys
more of my story

02:19.557 --> 02:20.889
and who I am on a plate.

02:20.933 --> 02:21.932
Everybody ready to find out

02:21.976 --> 02:23.308
what's in store tonight?

02:23.394 --> 02:24.810
All: Yes, chef.

02:24.854 --> 02:28.313
This next challenge
is a true monster.

02:28.357 --> 02:29.857
I'm scared.

02:29.900 --> 02:32.568
Tonight is all about immunity.

02:32.611 --> 02:36.029
Win this upcoming challenge,

02:36.073 --> 02:38.657
and you'll be safe from
tomorrow's elimination.

02:38.701 --> 02:40.450
Gordon:
Let's get this going.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.536
Tonight,
we have a huge guest.

02:42.580 --> 02:47.207
This guy's a multi
michelin star restaurateur,

02:47.251 --> 02:49.418
an expert
in japanese cuisine...

02:49.461 --> 02:50.794
- ( gasps )
- whoa.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.213
And one of the most
exciting chefs

02:53.257 --> 02:55.716
to grace any kitchen
on the planet.

02:55.759 --> 02:56.842
Oh, my god.

02:56.886 --> 03:00.295
Please welcome chef morimoto.

03:00.306 --> 03:01.763
-<i> ( music playing )</i>
- ( screaming, cheering )

03:01.807 --> 03:03.640
oh, my god!

03:03.684 --> 03:05.809
- Wow!
- Oh, my gosh.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.020
- Yes!
- Oh, my god!

03:08.063 --> 03:10.814
Oh, my gosh!

03:10.858 --> 03:13.275
Morimoto, the iron chef,

03:13.319 --> 03:16.403
one of the titans
in the culinary world.

03:16.447 --> 03:17.863
<i> I'm completely starstruck.</i>

03:17.907 --> 03:20.574
<i> I'm a huge fan</i>
<i> of morimoto-sama.</i>

03:20.618 --> 03:23.493
<i> I can't even believe</i>
<i> he's standing in front of me</i>
<i> right now.</i>

03:23.537 --> 03:25.329
It's-- it's insane.

03:25.372 --> 03:28.457
- Amazing. Good job.
- Oh, my god.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.001
Chef, welcome
to the masterchef kitchen.

03:31.045 --> 03:33.045
It's taken us ten years
to get you here,
but thankfully,

03:33.088 --> 03:35.088
- you're here now. Ten years.
- Ten years?

03:35.132 --> 03:38.300
- Congratulations
on all the success.
- Thank you, thank you.

03:38.344 --> 03:42.804
Guess what. Chef morimoto
has brought in these
beautiful, humongous--

03:42.848 --> 03:44.932
king crab.
Alaskan king crab.

03:44.975 --> 03:47.017
Now, these crabs
have been plucked

03:47.061 --> 03:49.427
out of that pristine water
across alaska and flown here.

03:49.438 --> 03:51.855
And tonight all of you

03:51.899 --> 03:53.649
are gonna have to turn
this alaskan king crab

03:53.692 --> 03:55.651
into something truly magical

03:55.694 --> 03:58.195
and break them down
yourselves.

03:58.239 --> 04:01.731
Oh, lord, if I mess this up

04:01.742 --> 04:04.952
in front of chef morimoto,
that's embarrassing.

04:04.995 --> 04:09.331
Now, the good news is
chef morimoto and I are
gonna show you how.

04:09.375 --> 04:12.584
- Oh, wow.
- Unreal. Thank you. Wow.

04:12.628 --> 04:14.253
Why am I crying?

04:14.296 --> 04:17.464
Being blessed to be
in the presence of somebody

04:17.508 --> 04:20.926
you look up to like that
is overwhelming.

04:20.970 --> 04:23.345
It's unbelievable.
It's unreal.

04:23.389 --> 04:25.389
Gordon: Right.
First things first,
alaskan king crab,

04:25.432 --> 04:27.140
it is the rolls-royce
of the sea.

04:27.184 --> 04:28.892
But the most important thing

04:28.936 --> 04:30.018
is to make sure
we get a maximum yield

04:30.062 --> 04:31.728
on all the crab coming out.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.898
How old do you think this is?

04:34.942 --> 04:37.234
15 years old, guys, okay?

04:37.278 --> 04:39.152
Pull off the legs first.

04:39.196 --> 04:44.157
One, two, and you pull
and twist as well.

04:44.201 --> 04:46.410
- Yeah.
- Three, and one big claw.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.453
Good.

04:48.497 --> 04:50.864
And twist. Beautiful.

04:50.874 --> 04:52.124
Wow.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.793
Twist and pull.

04:54.837 --> 04:55.919
- Bri: Wow.
- And be careful,

04:55.963 --> 04:57.254
so you do not tug it too hard.

04:57.298 --> 04:58.797
Just twist and pull.

04:58.841 --> 05:00.549
And then from there,
you just slide that off.

05:00.592 --> 05:03.168
This filament there,
we do not want to see that.

05:03.178 --> 05:04.636
- All right?
- You see, this is easy.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.805
I think you can use anything.
Don't hesitate there.

05:06.849 --> 05:08.557
Gordon: Take the scissors
as well, both sides.

05:08.600 --> 05:12.269
Take this. It's easier.

05:12.313 --> 05:15.689
A crab like this, we're
looking at around $500 cost.

05:15.733 --> 05:17.691
- Wow.
- Whoa.

05:17.735 --> 05:19.901
So think of the yield, okay?

05:19.945 --> 05:22.529
- I'm gonna use a knife,
first move, like this.
- Gotcha.

05:22.573 --> 05:25.032
This is easy.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.034
- And then take, open it.
- Nice.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.036
Then, easy.

05:29.079 --> 05:32.205
- Anyone dive for crabs?
- I catch them every day,
but not like this.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.708
And we use them for bait,
which you wouldn't do
for this either.

05:34.752 --> 05:36.877
I'm making sure
that I can do everything
exactly like he does it

05:36.920 --> 05:39.129
<i> and exactly like he does it.</i>

05:39.173 --> 05:40.422
<i> I'm stoked to be watching,</i>
<i> but at the same time,</i>

05:40.466 --> 05:41.631
I gotta focus on
what they're doing.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.091
Never smash the shell.

05:43.135 --> 05:44.926
What happens when
you smash the shell?

05:44.970 --> 05:46.553
- Get the shell in meat.
- You get bits of shell

05:46.597 --> 05:48.305
throughout the crab.

05:48.349 --> 05:51.767
Open up,
thumb underneath again,
and lift.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.477
- Look at that.
- Wow.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.145
Okay? Now, let's be honest,

05:55.189 --> 05:57.022
it's the kind of crab
that's almost like caviar.

05:57.066 --> 05:58.231
It's for finishing dishes.

05:58.275 --> 06:00.517
You don't put this
in a crab cake.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.361
- Understood? Never.
- All: Yes, chef.

06:02.404 --> 06:04.696
So understand what you're
dealing with here.

06:04.740 --> 06:06.782
And then you slice the claw.

06:06.825 --> 06:09.534
- On, twist, and snap.
- Wow.

06:09.578 --> 06:11.495
- It pops off.
- All: Wow.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.914
- Finger comes in underneath.
- ( whistles )

06:13.957 --> 06:17.459
- wow.
- Come in, then you come down.

06:17.503 --> 06:18.919
Now for the exciting part,

06:18.962 --> 06:21.046
putting the most amazing
jigsaw together.

06:21.090 --> 06:23.799
It's like pablo picasso
painting.

06:23.842 --> 06:26.510
<i> There's so much mess,</i>
<i> yet there's so much beauty,</i>

06:26.553 --> 06:28.595
<i> and you start to see this</i>
<i> picture being formed.</i>

06:29.932 --> 06:31.556
<i> And at the end, you have this</i>

06:31.600 --> 06:35.143
<i> perfectly broke down,</i>
<i> beautiful king crab.</i>

06:35.187 --> 06:37.604
- ( applause )
- that is how two master chefs

06:37.648 --> 06:38.855
break down
an alaskan king crab.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.474
- Oh, my gosh.
- Amazing. Amazing.

06:41.485 --> 06:43.360
Outstanding.
Thank y'all so much.

06:43.404 --> 06:45.570
This protein that I know
so little about--

06:45.614 --> 06:47.114
because being
deathly allergic,

06:47.157 --> 06:49.649
I stay away from it
like the bubonic plague.

06:49.660 --> 06:52.285
All right, everyone,
please come and grab a crab

06:52.329 --> 06:53.703
and head to your stations.

06:55.541 --> 06:56.832
Come on.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.875
- Ooh, they're heavy.
- Be careful.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.419
Be careful.
They'll poke you.

07:00.462 --> 07:03.255
I'm highly allergic
to crustaceans. All of them.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.382
<i> It's especially dangerous</i>
<i> to work with king crab</i>

07:05.426 --> 07:06.675
<i> because they have so many</i>
<i> prickly bits.</i>

07:06.718 --> 07:08.385
<i> I could puncture my hand</i>

07:08.429 --> 07:10.303
and I'll start to break out
in hives, I'll swell up.

07:10.347 --> 07:12.639
<i> I just need to stay calm,</i>

07:12.683 --> 07:14.433
because if I get nervous,
if I get scared,

07:14.476 --> 07:16.351
<i> I'll fall to pieces,</i>
<i> and I can't do that.</i>

07:16.395 --> 07:19.438
Now, tonight,
you'll have 60 minutes

07:19.481 --> 07:22.816
to take your crab and turn it
into a stunning dish.

07:22.860 --> 07:26.486
We wanna see you honor
that king crab.

07:26.521 --> 07:28.447
We want to honor morimoto.

07:30.033 --> 07:33.368
Immunity from elimination
is on the line.

07:33.412 --> 07:38.832
Right,
your 60 minutes start...

07:41.170 --> 07:43.044
- Now!
- Aarón: Yeah.

07:43.088 --> 07:45.130
( muttering )

07:46.049 --> 07:47.716
what should I do?

07:47.759 --> 07:50.719
There's no real way
you can mess up king crab

07:50.762 --> 07:52.387
except for trying
to do too much to it.

07:52.431 --> 07:54.014
<i> So, I decide on making</i>
<i> some king crab</i>

07:54.057 --> 07:55.891
and butternut squash
stuffed raviolis.

07:55.934 --> 07:57.100
Flour, flour, flour.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.810
I've actually never made
raviolis before.

07:58.854 --> 08:01.104
I tried one time at home.
Failed miserably.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.898
<i> I don't want them to think</i>
<i> I'm just a fish guy.</i>

08:02.941 --> 08:04.816
I want them to see me
making something

08:04.860 --> 08:05.734
that they haven't seen me
make yet.

08:08.530 --> 08:10.447
Ha-ha!
They got squid ink, baby!

08:10.491 --> 08:12.407
I really wanna show the judges

08:12.451 --> 08:14.326
<i> that even though</i>
<i> I can't eat crustaceans,</i>

08:14.369 --> 08:16.953
<i> I can create</i>
<i> a restaurant level dish</i>

08:16.997 --> 08:19.748
that they would love to serve
in their own restaurants.

08:22.336 --> 08:25.545
Extract that crab, everyone.

08:25.589 --> 08:26.796
Unbelievable.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.719
I know it's crazy
with chef morimoto here,

08:32.763 --> 08:36.806
but I might try to pull off
a king crab sushi burger.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.225
It's kind of like a craze
right now in the us,

08:38.268 --> 08:40.685
and if chef morimoto likes it,

08:40.729 --> 08:41.937
then I think
it's probably a done deal.

08:44.358 --> 08:48.276
I'm making a king crab
saffron risotto.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.444
It's definitely intimidating
a little bit,

08:49.488 --> 08:51.321
cooking for morimoto.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.907
They're taking it up
a few notches this season.

08:57.955 --> 09:00.747
I've never seen these
contestants so excited.

09:00.791 --> 09:02.290
There's no better crab
in the world.

09:02.334 --> 09:04.251
You don't see it
in restaurants very much

09:04.294 --> 09:05.669
because you have to charge
so much for it.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.212
We don't wanna see
crab cakes.

09:07.256 --> 09:08.913
- Deep-fried.
- We don't wanna see fried.

09:08.924 --> 09:10.757
You know, we wanna keep it
simple and pure.

09:10.801 --> 09:13.218
What's the one big mistake

09:13.262 --> 09:15.470
you think they could make
tonight with those crabs?

09:17.474 --> 09:19.808
Aarón: The idea is
that we wanna push them, chef.

09:19.851 --> 09:21.476
We want them
to feature the crab

09:21.520 --> 09:23.103
and really lift up
the creativity level.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.359
Guys, we've got 10 minutes gone,
15 minutes remaining.

09:31.572 --> 09:35.615
So, I'm cooking
a japanese style entrée.

09:35.659 --> 09:38.577
Really ambitious.
There's a lot of components.

09:38.620 --> 09:42.080
I'm not technically
cooking anything

09:42.124 --> 09:44.374
aside from my pickles,
so, we'll see.

09:44.418 --> 09:46.710
This is a risk,
but if morimoto loves this dish,

09:46.753 --> 09:48.837
I think I can die happy.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.505
Give a little insight
to what you're doing.

09:50.549 --> 09:51.965
I'm trying to push myself,
gordon.

09:52.009 --> 09:53.958
You know I cook
mostly indian food.

09:53.969 --> 09:57.429
- Yes.
- And so I'm gonna go
japanese inspired.

09:57.472 --> 10:00.515
Like, a really simple crab--
like a salad almost.

10:03.145 --> 10:05.186
Yeah.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.938
It's gonna be beautiful.

10:06.982 --> 10:08.982
Yes.

10:09.026 --> 10:11.484
Oh, my gosh, I have no idea
how I would highlight that.

10:11.528 --> 10:12.986
Yeah, I don't know.
I don't know.

10:13.030 --> 10:15.030
That's-- I cannot say.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.628
Yeah.

10:29.671 --> 10:31.212
It's gonna be beautiful.

10:31.256 --> 10:33.340
Yes.

10:33.383 --> 10:36.718
Oh, my gosh, I have no idea
how I would highlight that.

10:36.762 --> 10:38.136
I don't know.

10:38.180 --> 10:40.138
That's-- I cannot say.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.351
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Good luck.

10:46.855 --> 10:51.775
I am making a pappardelle pasta
with king crab.

10:51.818 --> 10:54.569
I make homemade pasta
once in a blue moon

10:54.613 --> 10:56.821
just for special occasions only.

10:56.865 --> 10:59.115
And being on "masterchef"
is a special occasion,

10:59.159 --> 11:03.111
so everyone's gonna enjoy.

11:03.121 --> 11:05.580
- Fred, tonight
is the night to shine.
- Fred: Absolutely, chef.

11:05.624 --> 11:08.583
I want to make sure
that this dish speaks true
to who I am

11:08.627 --> 11:11.285
<i> and my taiwanese roots</i>
<i> and traditions,</i>

11:11.296 --> 11:13.380
because if I don't
start showing them

11:13.423 --> 11:16.049
that I am telling my story
through my food,
they're gonna cut me.

11:16.093 --> 11:17.759
Give us an insight
to the dish.
What you doing?

11:17.803 --> 11:20.178
I'm making crab and crème
fraîche stuffed lanterns,

11:20.222 --> 11:21.763
which are gonna be
my little raviolo.

11:21.807 --> 11:23.589
So this is the meat
from which part?

11:23.600 --> 11:24.933
I'm using the knuckle meat
and some of the leg meat

11:24.976 --> 11:26.893
from the smaller portions
of the leg.

11:26.937 --> 11:28.228
- Gordon:
So you're making a pasta.
- Yes, I am.

11:28.271 --> 11:29.729
- And that's the lantern.
- Yes.

11:29.773 --> 11:31.764
So it's almost like
your take on a ravioli.

11:31.775 --> 11:33.400
- Oh!
- Yes, I'm actually gonna take
an asian concept

11:33.443 --> 11:35.360
- of a wonton soup...
- Gordon: Yes.

11:35.404 --> 11:36.820
...And turn it european.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.613
How are you gonna combine that
inside that ravioli?

11:38.657 --> 11:39.981
What are you gonna use
to bring it together?

11:39.991 --> 11:41.449
I'm gonna use a tiny bit
crème fraîche.

11:41.493 --> 11:42.575
I'm gonna season it
with lemon zest,

11:42.619 --> 11:44.068
salt, pepper,
and fennel pollen.

11:44.079 --> 11:45.620
Oh, you're not using
this one a little more?

11:45.664 --> 11:48.289
So maybe you don't
need this one, this one.
Put them in there.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.291
You want that flavor coming
out of those knuckles.

11:50.335 --> 11:51.876
- Absolutely, chef.
- Sounds amazing.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.169
- Good luck, okay?
- Thank you, chef.

11:58.677 --> 12:01.469
Cooking for one of my idols.

12:01.513 --> 12:04.264
I think morimoto
is in a league of his own,

12:04.307 --> 12:06.015
but I relish in pressure.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.809
To be able to give him a dish,
let him taste it.

12:07.853 --> 12:09.477
I mean, are we kidding?
It's season ten.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.688
I mean, it doesn't--
it doesn't get better than this.

12:11.732 --> 12:14.733
Oh, boy, here we go.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.943
Wuta:
<i> Back home in new york,</i>

12:16.987 --> 12:19.195
I love eating chinese food
from around the block

12:19.239 --> 12:22.157
<i> or going to fine dining</i>
<i> restaurants in chinatown</i>

12:22.200 --> 12:24.159
and tasting
these asian cuisines.

12:24.202 --> 12:27.120
I'm excited because this is
where I'm the most comfortable.

12:27.164 --> 12:28.580
Aarón: So what you got
going on here, buddy?

12:28.623 --> 12:29.998
So I'm gonna do
a kimchi fried rice.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.249
I'm gonna fold the crab in

12:31.293 --> 12:32.917
and then also top it with crab.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.128
What is gonna give
that fried rice some flavor

12:35.172 --> 12:36.588
and some unique elements?

12:36.631 --> 12:38.465
That's the green apple
and lemon.

12:38.508 --> 12:40.216
I'm gonna fold that
into the end.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.343
I'm gonna play
with the toasted peppercorn,

12:42.387 --> 12:45.597
and even with the kimchi,
I'm using rice wine vinegar
to elevate the kimchi.

12:45.640 --> 12:48.391
The one thing I'm concerned
about is you have very
aggressive flavors,

12:48.435 --> 12:51.394
fermented flavors
like oyster sauce, kimchi.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.896
- Strong.
- Big flavors,

12:52.939 --> 12:54.814
and crab is very delicate
and sweet.

12:54.858 --> 12:58.109
So just be mindful on how
you add and season your rice.

12:58.153 --> 13:01.404
I don't really eat crab anymore,
but what I do know is rice.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.740
And I'm really excited
to show the judges

13:03.784 --> 13:06.868
that I have grown from
my first dish of rice till now.

13:06.912 --> 13:08.411
This is season ten
of "masterchef,"

13:08.455 --> 13:10.955
we're expecting nothing
but the best from you, okay?

13:10.999 --> 13:13.500
- All right, good luck, wuta.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.757
Hi, chef.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.592
What an honor.
Thank you so much
for being here.

13:22.636 --> 13:25.011
I've been watching you with
my family, man, for 20 years.

13:25.055 --> 13:27.972
I mean, what a crazy show,
but I'm just speechless.

13:28.016 --> 13:30.225
- What's the dish?
- Okay, so we're going to
be doing a gazpacho

13:30.268 --> 13:32.477
- with summer orange tomatoes.
- This one?

13:32.521 --> 13:35.063
I thought the color
was beautiful, so I did
a lot of the orange.

13:35.106 --> 13:38.483
Put some cucumber,
cayenne, salt, pepper,
apple cider vinegar.

13:38.527 --> 13:39.818
And I puréed-- what, sir?

13:39.861 --> 13:41.945
- No crab in there.
- No crab. No, sir.

13:41.988 --> 13:44.405
- Noah's allergic to crab.
- Deathly allergic to shellfish.

13:44.449 --> 13:47.617
Yeah, I can't taste
it at all. I don't--

13:47.661 --> 13:49.744
oh, absolutely. This is one
of the greatest ingredients,

13:49.788 --> 13:51.162
if not the greatest
ingredients I've ever had.

13:51.206 --> 13:52.413
You put that stock in there
at the end,

13:52.457 --> 13:54.207
it's gonna be almost
like a sauce.

13:54.251 --> 13:55.834
Otherwise you don't--
it's gonna water that down.

13:55.877 --> 13:57.293
I'll see.
If it's not good enough,
I'll leave it off,

13:57.337 --> 13:58.920
'cause that's one thing
you've taught me.

13:58.964 --> 14:00.713
If it's not good enough,
definitely leave it off.

14:02.968 --> 14:04.801
I am feeling so good.

14:04.845 --> 14:06.302
This is one of my favorite dish.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.180
This is a simple cajun
crab omelet

14:09.224 --> 14:12.267
with a cajun crawfish
étouffée sauce.

14:12.310 --> 14:15.144
I'm gonna show them
how an omelet can be very,
very elevated as well.

14:16.857 --> 14:19.482
Gordon: An amazing bunch
of exciting dishes.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.818
Looks like renee's making
the most amazing pasta there.

14:21.862 --> 14:24.112
Aarón: You know, and that's
a traditional avenue to take,

14:24.155 --> 14:25.446
so we'll see
how it comes out.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.656
Wuta, fried rice.

14:26.700 --> 14:29.117
- He's a vegetarian, wuta.
- Ah!

14:29.160 --> 14:30.577
He's gonna put the crab
in the fried rice.

14:30.620 --> 14:33.204
Yeah.

14:33.248 --> 14:35.415
It's salty already.
Sweet and salty,

14:35.458 --> 14:38.001
so they need to taste it
before they start cooking.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.961
Fred, yeah, he's taking a turn

14:40.005 --> 14:41.838
on almost like
a taiwanese lantern.

14:41.882 --> 14:45.091
The flavor of that broth
already looks amazing.

14:45.135 --> 14:47.886
30 minutes gone,
30 minutes to go, guys.

14:47.929 --> 14:49.846
One stunning portion.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.264
Oh, no.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.811
( groan )

14:56.855 --> 14:58.730
it didn't work.

14:58.773 --> 15:00.681
Nick:
<i> The sushi burger</i>
<i> isn't gonna work.</i>

15:00.692 --> 15:02.567
The rice is too flimsy.

15:02.611 --> 15:04.769
I look over at the clock,
it's 30 minutes left.

15:04.779 --> 15:06.279
I need to win immunity

15:06.323 --> 15:08.239
and this sushi burger idea
is too big a risk.

15:08.283 --> 15:09.866
<i> I need to scrap it</i>
<i> and move on.</i>

15:09.910 --> 15:12.911
If I waver any more,
I'm gonna run out of time.

15:12.913 --> 15:14.913
I have no idea.

15:24.633 --> 15:27.634
- Gordon:
30 minutes to go, guys.
- ( nick groans ) of time.

15:27.677 --> 15:29.552
Nick:
<i> The sushi burger</i>
<i> isn't gonna work.</i>

15:29.596 --> 15:32.388
If I waver any more,
I'm gonna run out of time.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.057
No idea.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.558
I've essentially put myself
at a disadvantage

15:35.602 --> 15:36.976
<i> by starting over.</i>

15:37.020 --> 15:38.227
I'm normally more composed.
I'm calm.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.687
I come in with a really
strong plan.

15:39.731 --> 15:41.689
<i> So, I'm a bit</i>
<i> all over the place,</i>

15:41.733 --> 15:43.641
but, you know,
I just keep pushing.

15:43.652 --> 15:45.068
- Chef, joe.
- What do you got, nick?

15:45.111 --> 15:47.820
I started off trying to make
a king crab sushi burger,

15:47.864 --> 15:51.199
but now I'm making basically
butter poached king crab

15:51.242 --> 15:53.159
with lightly smoked sunchokes.

15:53.203 --> 15:55.536
You have good components here.
This has good flavor.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.121
- Thank you.
- That has good flavor.

15:57.165 --> 15:59.123
- Had to pivot
a little bit, but--
- here's the deal, nick.

15:59.167 --> 16:01.459
In order to be a masterchef,
how you rebound

16:01.503 --> 16:04.337
and how you excel in these
very difficult situations

16:04.381 --> 16:06.130
- is gonna speak volumes
of you, okay?
- Yes.

16:06.174 --> 16:07.590
So look at this
as an opportunity,

16:07.634 --> 16:09.509
- not an obstacle.
- I will.

16:09.552 --> 16:11.678
- All right?
- Thank you, chef.
Thank you very much, chef.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.221
I know if I set
my mind to this,

16:13.264 --> 16:15.515
I'll finish all the components,
I'll make a beautiful dish.

16:15.558 --> 16:17.558
<i> But I'm a little worried that</i>
<i> I might not finish in time.</i>

16:24.025 --> 16:25.900
Gordon:
25 minutes to go, guys.

16:31.199 --> 16:32.773
Jamie:
<i> What I'm concerned about,</i>

16:32.784 --> 16:34.450
<i> what I need to take</i>
<i> my time doing</i>

16:34.494 --> 16:36.452
is making a dish with finesse

16:36.496 --> 16:38.538
and making sure that
what I present is something

16:38.581 --> 16:41.374
<i> that chef morimoto</i>
<i> is gonna look at and say,</i>

16:41.418 --> 16:42.792
"this guy's respecting
this crab."

16:42.836 --> 16:44.544
- hey there.
- Thanks for coming.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.045
Gives us an insight to the dish.
What are you doing?

16:46.089 --> 16:49.165
So I am doing a kind of
rustic cut butternut squash.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.551
I'm trying to utilize this
little reproductive flat meat.

16:51.594 --> 16:53.302
I know it's rich and it's
a little bit different taste.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.721
So, what do you think of that,

16:54.764 --> 16:55.972
the muscle going
in the butternut squash?

16:56.016 --> 16:57.557
Yeah?

16:59.144 --> 17:01.227
- No.
- Okay, so let's switch up.

17:01.271 --> 17:02.395
No, you can put them in.

17:02.439 --> 17:03.938
- Maybe a knuckle piece.
- A knuckle piece.

17:03.982 --> 17:05.857
But just--
you flake it out.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.359
- And so you stick that inside.
- Yes!

17:08.403 --> 17:10.194
Now I can taste the crab.
Do you see what I'm saying?

17:10.238 --> 17:11.696
- Absolutely.
- Yeah? Don't forget,

17:11.740 --> 17:13.614
a touch of citron,
a little bit of tarragon.

17:13.700 --> 17:18.369
Yeah, I'm actually gonna do
blood orange and lemon zest.

17:18.413 --> 17:20.038
Boiling water?

17:20.081 --> 17:21.581
For the raviolis.

17:21.624 --> 17:22.749
Oh, yeah, yeah.

17:22.792 --> 17:24.417
- Well thought of.
- Thank you, chef.

17:24.461 --> 17:25.752
- Remember, think in front.
- ( laughs )

17:31.843 --> 17:34.343
I want to continue
to put myself on a plate

17:34.387 --> 17:36.137
and the things
that I grew up with,

17:36.181 --> 17:37.597
<i> and I want to represent</i>
<i> my family</i>

17:37.640 --> 17:39.423
and I want to
represent my roots.

17:39.434 --> 17:41.768
- All right, so, dorian.
- Whatever it is,
it's beautiful.

17:41.811 --> 17:42.935
- What are those?
- Those are fried green--

17:42.979 --> 17:44.645
- fried green tomatoes.
- Love it.

17:44.689 --> 17:47.190
- "tomaytas."
- "tomaytas." tomatoes.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.901
My mom used to make these
all the time,

17:49.944 --> 17:53.196
and as a mom myself,
I've made them for my children.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.697
So what else do you have going
on in your dish here?

17:54.741 --> 17:56.032
Light crab salad.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.867
I wanna keep
the integrity of the crab.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.285
I don't wanna do
too much to it.

17:59.329 --> 18:01.496
This is really good.
Acidity, acidity.

18:01.539 --> 18:03.790
- Thank you.
- Do you have something base
or something creamy...

18:03.833 --> 18:05.625
- Yes, I do.
- ...To moderate it?
What are you gonna do?

18:05.668 --> 18:07.960
- Yeah, there you go.
She's already on it.
- Ah!

18:08.004 --> 18:09.170
- Look, don't even--
- yeah, there you are.

18:09.214 --> 18:11.080
- What is this, spicy mayo?
- It is.

18:11.091 --> 18:13.674
Dorian, out there in georgia, do
you have a chance to get with--

18:13.718 --> 18:15.843
hey, take it "eash."
you have a chance--

18:15.887 --> 18:17.470
you can eat all you want.
Here.

18:17.514 --> 18:19.472
You want me to feed it to you?
You can have all you want.

18:19.516 --> 18:21.265
Do you work with a lot
of king crab back home?

18:21.309 --> 18:23.384
No, I do not.

18:23.394 --> 18:26.813
My husband and I go
to a restaurant
that serves king crab,

18:26.856 --> 18:30.024
and I was pregnant
and I sat down and ate,
like, six whole legs.

18:30.068 --> 18:32.193
But, I mean,
other than that, no.

18:32.237 --> 18:34.362
- It's a delicacy.
I mean, it's expensive.
- Yeah.

18:34.405 --> 18:36.531
- It's not--
- for someone who's
never cooked it,

18:36.574 --> 18:39.775
this is a really great
interpretation
of the delicacy,

18:39.786 --> 18:41.494
really with
balanced acidity.

18:41.538 --> 18:45.123
- Love it!
- Oh! Thank you.

18:45.166 --> 18:47.416
- Gordon: Sam.
- Chef morimoto,
it's an honor.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.544
So I'm doing a crab
and corn chowder.

18:49.587 --> 18:52.505
This is a fish stock, chef,
that I cooked down
with some fennel

18:52.549 --> 18:53.798
- this?
- And some--

18:53.842 --> 18:56.592
- some king crab legs.
- Great. It tastes okay,

18:56.636 --> 18:59.178
- but it doesn't taste
like king crab.
- Morimoto: Not much.

18:59.222 --> 19:00.680
You need to strengthen that.
All these little bits here,

19:00.723 --> 19:02.515
- you get it in there.
- Understood, chef.

19:02.559 --> 19:04.684
- I really wanna prove myself.
- On a night like tonight

19:04.727 --> 19:06.394
- in front of chef here.
- Absolutely.

19:06.437 --> 19:08.938
This is a dream for me.
I really want this, chef.

19:08.982 --> 19:11.515
You've got 15 minutes to go.
Flavor, please.

19:11.526 --> 19:12.775
Thank you so much, chef.
Absolutely, chef.

19:15.780 --> 19:18.781
Micah:<i> This is my most</i>
<i> challenging one yet</i>

19:18.825 --> 19:20.733
because I don't know
how a king crab tastes.

19:20.743 --> 19:22.034
I don't know
how any crab tastes.

19:22.078 --> 19:25.204
<i> So I really need to use</i>
<i> my knowledge of flavors</i>

19:25.248 --> 19:28.624
and herbs and really
put together something
that's gonna work.

19:28.668 --> 19:31.252
I just wanna say
this is mind-blowing.

19:31.296 --> 19:33.421
- Standing in front of you
and gordon at the same time?
- No, no, thank you.

19:33.464 --> 19:35.089
I couldn't have imagined
anything crazier.

19:35.133 --> 19:37.082
- Give us an insight
into the dish.
- Oh!

19:37.093 --> 19:40.094
- Oh, wow.
- This is squid ink
tarragon risotto,

19:40.138 --> 19:42.889
and I'm gonna be doing my crab
in a beurre monte sauce.

19:42.932 --> 19:46.184
And I have over here
my lemon saffron aioli over top.

19:46.227 --> 19:48.603
It's very rare you finish
a risotto with aioli.

19:48.646 --> 19:50.188
- Why are you going there?
- It brings-- it has lemon,

19:50.231 --> 19:52.565
it has the brightness
of the saffron.

19:52.609 --> 19:54.775
- It adds color to the plate.
- But you can pour that
into risotto.

19:54.819 --> 19:56.944
Just drizzled lightly
over top, chef,

19:56.988 --> 19:58.738
just to bring some flavor
to the crab as well.

19:58.781 --> 20:01.908
But make sure the risotto
is rich, buttery.

20:01.951 --> 20:03.618
- Nothing crab meat?
- No, sir, I'm also--

20:03.661 --> 20:05.161
I'm allergic to shellfish.

20:06.414 --> 20:07.788
I cannot taste it.

20:07.832 --> 20:09.373
You should be flaking all
those little knuckles

20:09.417 --> 20:10.374
in there so you got crab
in there as well.

20:10.418 --> 20:12.210
- Crab in there as well.
- Okay.

20:12.253 --> 20:13.794
- That would taste delicious.
- Thank you, chef.

20:15.715 --> 20:18.549
Gordon: Guys,
just under seven minutes to go.

20:24.474 --> 20:26.257
Dang it.

20:26.267 --> 20:28.809
My pasta is sticking
to the roller,

20:28.853 --> 20:32.605
and I can't find
a pasta cutter anywhere.

20:32.649 --> 20:37.109
So, I hand cut with a knife
and they are wretched.

20:37.153 --> 20:40.696
<i> I am feeling</i>
<i> really frustrated right now.</i>

20:40.740 --> 20:43.115
<i> I'm a huge perfectionist</i>
<i>and if it's not gonna work out,</i>

20:43.159 --> 20:44.742
<i> then I just throw it away.</i>

20:44.786 --> 20:47.203
So this is gonna be
your white wine sauce?

20:47.247 --> 20:49.497
- Yes, sir.
- Where are the pappardelle?

20:49.540 --> 20:50.998
- Those are the ones
I'm gonna cook.
- These?

20:51.042 --> 20:54.752
This is not pasta.
This is, like, scraps.

20:54.796 --> 20:55.962
Where's the rest
of the pasta?

20:56.005 --> 20:57.255
I threw it away.
I was pissed.

20:57.298 --> 20:59.465
You can't make a pasta
with this.

20:59.509 --> 21:02.510
I'm going to.
Please, let me try.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.020
I just don't understand,
though.

21:13.064 --> 21:14.814
Like, why did you throw
the pasta away?

21:14.857 --> 21:16.440
Because it got stuck
in here.

21:16.484 --> 21:18.067
You should've called me
for help.

21:18.111 --> 21:19.735
I would've helped.
Let's see. Where is it?

21:19.779 --> 21:22.196
It's still clean.
It's on top. It's not dirty.

21:22.240 --> 21:25.032
I'm having issues with my dough,
trying to roll it out.

21:25.076 --> 21:27.618
You can't let the kitchen get
the better of you like that.

21:27.662 --> 21:30.705
Just put this through here
and make fettuccini.

21:30.748 --> 21:33.291
Just get 'em long enough,
cut 'em, flour 'em,
leave 'em in a nice pile,

21:33.334 --> 21:34.667
let 'em aerate,
and then boil them.

21:34.711 --> 21:37.378
Yes, sir. Thank you.
Oh, my goodness.

21:37.422 --> 21:40.339
<i> Thank god for joe.</i>
<i> He helped me and he saved me.</i>

21:40.383 --> 21:42.049
<i> But there's five minutes left</i>

21:42.093 --> 21:45.803
<i> and immunity is on the line.</i>

21:45.847 --> 21:48.514
Come on, are you kidding me?
Where's the basil?

21:48.558 --> 21:50.391
Four minutes to go.
Come on.

21:50.435 --> 21:52.134
Don't plate
too early, fred.

21:52.145 --> 21:54.186
Aarón: Let's go, subha.
Let's go to the plate.

21:54.230 --> 21:57.064
Love the taste of micah's
squid ink risotto.

21:57.108 --> 21:59.525
Putting some of the crab
in there as well, fold in
some of those knuckles.

21:59.569 --> 22:02.611
- Joe: Renee, those are done.
- ( screams )

22:02.655 --> 22:05.656
nick, he has a lot
of great components.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.366
He has a little butter sauce.
He has some toasted farro.

22:07.410 --> 22:10.202
He has a little corn purée.

22:10.246 --> 22:11.829
- But I don't know what
the essence of the dish is.
- Yeah, he's behind.

22:22.425 --> 22:25.259
90 seconds to go, guys.
Come on.

22:25.303 --> 22:27.178
Start plating, let's go!

22:28.848 --> 22:30.890
This is going everywhere.

22:33.269 --> 22:35.519
Come on, guys.
Presentation is key.

22:35.563 --> 22:38.898
- Crab has to be the hero.
- Where are the green onions?

22:40.151 --> 22:41.442
50 seconds to go.

22:41.486 --> 22:43.319
( bleep ).
Are you kidding me?

22:43.363 --> 22:45.529
Does anybody
have green onion?

22:49.744 --> 22:51.327
Aarón: Here we go.
Homestretch.

22:51.371 --> 22:52.995
Oh, my god.

22:58.961 --> 23:03.172
All: Five, four,
three, two, one.

23:03.216 --> 23:05.633
- That's it.
- And stop. Hands in the air.

23:05.676 --> 23:08.719
- Well done.
- ( dorian sighs )

23:08.763 --> 23:11.055
so simple, but yet
so difficult. Jeez.

23:11.099 --> 23:13.140
That was excellent.

23:13.184 --> 23:16.102
With that impression tonight,
you raised the bar again.

23:16.145 --> 23:20.147
Chef, they are on form.

23:20.191 --> 23:22.817
That means you have
to come back next week.

23:22.860 --> 23:24.777
- Anything you need.
- There you go.

23:24.821 --> 23:27.405
Now, as you work
across those 60 minutes,

23:27.448 --> 23:30.783
we study,
we taste as you cook.

23:30.827 --> 23:34.787
There were plenty standout
dishes tonight.

23:34.831 --> 23:37.456
And with that said,
we've decided tonight

23:37.500 --> 23:40.167
there are six dishes
that we'd love

23:40.211 --> 23:42.211
to take
a much closer look at.

23:44.215 --> 23:46.924
The first dish showed
great flair,

23:46.968 --> 23:49.009
and it was so nice
to see that flair

23:49.053 --> 23:53.889
based on the rough week
that individual had last week.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.684
Please, step forward, wuta.

23:56.727 --> 23:59.270
- Whoo!
- Let's go, wu!

23:59.313 --> 24:01.480
Morimoto's about
to eat my food!

24:01.524 --> 24:06.318
This legendary chef is going
to really give me feedback

24:06.362 --> 24:10.364
<i> on how to be better,</i>
<i> but I'm a little nervous.</i>

24:10.408 --> 24:12.700
Young man,
describe your dish, please.

24:12.743 --> 24:15.619
So what we have here
is a kimchi fried rice

24:15.663 --> 24:17.371
with a fried egg

24:17.415 --> 24:19.707
and on top
we have the king crab.

24:33.931 --> 24:36.056
- Wuta: Oh.
- ...Like this.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.308
There we go. Thank you.

24:39.770 --> 24:41.353
This reminds me of you
conjuring up

24:41.397 --> 24:44.139
a chinese spot
there in the bronx

24:44.150 --> 24:47.735
and then letting
the masterchef kitchen
influence that food memory.

24:47.778 --> 24:49.945
- Thank you.
- There's no bronx in that.

24:49.989 --> 24:52.948
The crab meat
and the fried rice
is smart, spicy.

24:52.992 --> 24:55.117
- It's the full deal.
- Thank you.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.578
- Chef.
- Hmm.

24:59.665 --> 25:01.207
Yeah.

25:04.629 --> 25:06.504
...And any things.

25:07.465 --> 25:09.298
- Good.
- Yeah.

25:09.342 --> 25:11.550
I would've taken
those knuckles and claws,

25:11.594 --> 25:13.844
reduced them down,
made a little-- little bisque

25:13.888 --> 25:15.471
and brushed the varnish.

25:15.515 --> 25:19.767
But if you'd asked me
two months ago,

25:19.810 --> 25:21.352
can a vegetarian
cook this good?

25:21.395 --> 25:24.605
Never. Tonight,
you proved us wrong.

25:24.649 --> 25:26.815
- Well done. Good job.
- Thank you very much,
all of you guys.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.609
- Good job, wuta.
- Thank you.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.362
Way to go, wuta.

25:31.405 --> 25:33.447
So the next home cook,
they impressed us

25:33.491 --> 25:37.243
with their plating skills
and their attention to detail.

25:37.286 --> 25:41.121
They have been at the top
of multiple immunity challenges.

25:41.165 --> 25:46.502
Please, bring your dish
forward, nick.

25:47.338 --> 25:49.213
Yes.

25:49.257 --> 25:50.673
Nick:
<i> I'm feeling really nervous.</i>

25:50.716 --> 25:53.467
I put myself at a disadvantage
giving myself 30 minutes

25:53.511 --> 25:55.803
<i> by deciding to nix</i>
<i> the sushi burger idea.</i>

25:55.846 --> 25:57.680
Joe: Uh-oh.

25:57.723 --> 25:59.557
<i> Now I hope that wasn't</i>
<i> a huge mistake.</i>

25:59.600 --> 26:01.016
You were a little bit uncertain

26:01.060 --> 26:02.560
at the beginning
of the concept of your dish.

26:02.603 --> 26:04.311
You kind of zigged
and zagged.

26:04.355 --> 26:06.355
Are you happy with the result?

26:06.399 --> 26:08.857
Uh, I tried
with a different dish,

26:08.901 --> 26:11.485
- sort of a sushi burger.
But I'm really happy with it.
- Aarón: So let's see.

26:19.328 --> 26:20.953
Morimoto: Hmm.

26:22.039 --> 26:24.707
So... Yeah.

26:24.750 --> 26:28.669
So...

26:49.317 --> 26:50.983
I-- I tried, chef.

26:51.027 --> 26:52.985
Nicholas, please,
describe your dish.

26:53.029 --> 26:54.778
So I have a butter poached
king crab

26:54.822 --> 26:57.656
with crispy smoked
sunchokes,

26:57.700 --> 27:00.609
and a creamy corn purée
with a fennel salad.

27:00.620 --> 27:01.952
The fact
that you got that done

27:01.996 --> 27:04.738
after that first one
going off-piece is amazing.

27:04.749 --> 27:08.208
I think the lumps
of crab at the end
shows a lack of maturity.

27:08.252 --> 27:11.337
- Yes, chef.
- You don't serve
that much crab anywhere

27:11.380 --> 27:13.130
unless it's for two
or three guests.

27:13.174 --> 27:14.506
That's probably
a hundred dollars
worth of crab on there.

27:14.550 --> 27:15.883
Again, it's all
about the flavor.

27:15.926 --> 27:17.000
Gents, shall we?

27:17.011 --> 27:18.886
All right.

27:25.436 --> 27:28.228
I really enjoy the way
that this dish came together

27:28.272 --> 27:30.439
considering that
you were up against it.

27:30.483 --> 27:31.815
I just think you have
so many rich components

27:31.859 --> 27:33.859
that you need acid.
I think it needs lemon.

27:33.903 --> 27:37.237
- Thank you, chef.
- I think the whole dish
really is quite good.

27:37.281 --> 27:40.783
For me, the crust
on the sunchokes
is so strong.

27:40.826 --> 27:42.743
And I love it,
don't get me wrong.

27:42.787 --> 27:44.870
But they dominate.

27:44.914 --> 27:46.705
On a crab, I was looking
for more delicate flavors.

27:46.749 --> 27:50.042
So, you used a lot
of crab meat.

27:50.086 --> 27:52.503
- A little too much.
- Yes, chef.

27:55.341 --> 27:56.548
That's a really great job.

27:56.592 --> 27:58.258
Thank you, chef.

27:58.302 --> 27:59.760
The sunchokes are the star,

27:59.804 --> 28:01.428
'cause you haven't
done much for the crab.

28:01.472 --> 28:03.931
You've taken the crab out
and stuck it on top.

28:03.974 --> 28:05.724
But here's
the fascinating
thing about you.

28:05.768 --> 28:07.184
You're like
this rough diamond
that's come to life

28:07.228 --> 28:08.477
in this competition.

28:08.521 --> 28:10.262
What you've done
with those sunchokes

28:10.272 --> 28:12.731
is mind-blowing.
I think it works,

28:12.775 --> 28:14.900
just cut back on that
rolls-royce of crab.

28:14.944 --> 28:16.485
- Yes, chef.
- Well done.

28:16.529 --> 28:18.654
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

28:18.698 --> 28:20.531
- Good job, buddy.
- Good job, nick.

28:20.574 --> 28:24.451
Okay, guys,
we are very intrigued

28:24.495 --> 28:28.414
to taste a little bit more
of this asian-inspired dish.

28:28.457 --> 28:30.958
Please, bring your
dish forward, shari.

28:31.001 --> 28:33.544
- All right, shari.
- Great, shari. Great job.

28:33.587 --> 28:35.838
I can't even contain myself.
I just love morimoto

28:35.881 --> 28:38.590
and I really wanna impress him.

28:38.634 --> 28:43.044
<i> I hope that my crab salad</i>
<i>is good enough to get immunity.</i>

28:43.055 --> 28:45.723
Mmm. So, shari,
what is the dish?

28:45.766 --> 28:48.892
I have in front of you
a yuzu vinaigrette,

28:48.936 --> 28:51.395
a green apple pickle,

28:51.439 --> 28:54.314
and a crab salad
with an avocado mousseline.

28:54.358 --> 28:56.400
- Shall we?
- Yes.

29:06.746 --> 29:08.620
Mm-hmm.

29:08.664 --> 29:12.458
I just gotta say,
it is just spot-on
on multiple levels.

29:12.501 --> 29:15.210
It has texture,
you manipulated the crab.

29:15.254 --> 29:18.589
Man, it is just hitting on
all facets of deliciousness.

29:18.632 --> 29:20.841
- Thank you, chef.
- Bright, clean.

29:20.885 --> 29:22.176
- Mmm.
- Focused.

29:22.219 --> 29:24.303
- Three star dish.
- Oh, my god.

29:24.346 --> 29:26.388
You should have your indian
mother-in-law taste this.

29:26.432 --> 29:27.890
It'll turn her hair blonde.

29:32.813 --> 29:34.730
- Morimoto: Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

29:34.774 --> 29:37.608
The evolution of your start
of cooking is extraordinary.

29:37.651 --> 29:38.984
You're not playing safe.

29:39.028 --> 29:40.143
You're out
of that comfort zone.

29:40.154 --> 29:41.653
It's good to see you shine.

29:41.697 --> 29:42.988
- Great job.
- Joe: Great job, shari.

29:43.032 --> 29:45.699
- Shari!
- Good job, shari.

29:45.743 --> 29:47.826
- Delicious.
- That's what we're
talking about here.

29:47.870 --> 29:49.620
Thank you.

29:49.663 --> 29:52.656
The next home cook,
their dish told

29:52.666 --> 29:54.583
a compelling personal story.

29:54.627 --> 29:57.878
- Fred, please step forward.
- Go, fred!

29:57.922 --> 29:59.379
Thank you, chef.

30:02.802 --> 30:06.720
- Ooh-la-la.
- Please describe
the dish, fred.

30:06.764 --> 30:09.056
It's called "welcome to
the lantern festival."

30:09.099 --> 30:12.100
I have crab and crème fraîche
stuffed lanterns

30:12.144 --> 30:13.977
in a crab and fennel broth.

30:14.021 --> 30:19.233
Welcome to the bri standard
of plating.

30:19.276 --> 30:21.735
- Thank you.
- Finally, somebody else is
popping with such finesse.

30:21.779 --> 30:22.903
Thank you.

30:22.947 --> 30:24.446
So the idea is
to hit the broth

30:24.490 --> 30:26.532
- over the lanterns?
- Yep.

30:26.575 --> 30:28.617
Did you make pasta
or was it a wonton paste?

30:28.661 --> 30:30.118
I made my own pasta dough.

30:31.831 --> 30:33.997
Joe: Very nice.

30:41.841 --> 30:43.090
Gordon: Chef?

30:45.219 --> 30:46.468
From the heart.

30:50.975 --> 30:52.474
This is kind of asian stuff.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.726
- So, thank you. Good job.
- Thank you, chef.

30:54.770 --> 30:56.311
I love everything
about this dish.

30:56.355 --> 30:57.771
I think
it's very personal

30:57.815 --> 30:59.022
and you can taste it
on the plate.

30:59.066 --> 31:01.859
Today dishes need
to be subtle,

31:01.902 --> 31:03.235
sweet, elegant, refined.

31:03.279 --> 31:04.653
This dish is all of that.

31:04.697 --> 31:06.113
- Good job, fred.
- Thank you, joe.

31:06.156 --> 31:07.447
There's an amazing
feel good factor

31:07.491 --> 31:09.950
after eating this dish,
'cause it's you.

31:09.994 --> 31:12.578
It's light,
it's sophisticated.

31:12.621 --> 31:15.622
It's, I think,
one of your best dishes ever

31:15.666 --> 31:17.165
- in this competition.
- Thank you.

31:17.209 --> 31:19.126
And the nice thing for me,
it's not a dessert.

31:19.169 --> 31:21.128
That's a nice thing.
Great job, well done.

31:21.171 --> 31:22.787
- Thank you, chef.
- Amazing.

31:22.798 --> 31:26.875
Chef morimoto,
he's a huge influence

31:26.886 --> 31:28.844
on the asian food scene
in america.

31:28.888 --> 31:32.389
<i> I have been struggling so much</i>
<i> with my own identity,</i>

31:32.433 --> 31:35.559
so for him to go
and like my dish,
it's incredible.

31:35.603 --> 31:39.229
- Amazing.
- I can't believe
this happened.

31:39.273 --> 31:41.189
The next home cook
really did a great job.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.901
Please, bring your dish
forward, dorian.

31:43.944 --> 31:47.354
- Let's go, dorian. Let's go!
- Way to go, dorian.

31:47.364 --> 31:49.364
<i> I would've never thought</i>
<i> in a million years</i>

31:49.408 --> 31:52.242
that chef morimoto would be
tasting any of my food.

31:52.286 --> 31:54.453
- Yes!
-<i> But here we are.</i>

31:54.496 --> 31:56.830
<i> I'm standing</i>
<i> on the masterchef stage</i>

31:56.874 --> 32:00.751
<i> handing chef morimoto</i>
<i> my plate to taste,</i>

32:00.794 --> 32:04.046
and I am floating
on cloud nine.

32:04.089 --> 32:06.423
Dorian, you just gave yourself
a fist bump internally.

32:06.467 --> 32:07.832
- Yes.
- What is that about?

32:07.843 --> 32:10.677
I'm very excited
for you guys to taste it

32:10.721 --> 32:13.055
because it's my family
on the plate.

32:13.098 --> 32:14.723
Please, describe your dish.

32:14.767 --> 32:19.645
I have a light herb
and citrus king crab salad

32:19.688 --> 32:22.606
and fried green tomatoes
and the aioli underneath

32:22.650 --> 32:24.524
just to add
a little bit of heat.

32:30.115 --> 32:33.033
It's very, very satisfying,
and again, dorian,

32:33.077 --> 32:36.328
you are able to put yourself
on the plate every time,

32:36.372 --> 32:38.080
but you do it
in a thoughtful way

32:38.123 --> 32:39.498
of someone who really
knows how to cook.

32:39.541 --> 32:41.708
And that's really
an important factor

32:41.752 --> 32:44.461
- in your success.
- Thank you, joe.

32:44.505 --> 32:46.213
I think structurally
there could have been
some differences here.

32:46.256 --> 32:48.790
I think you could've cut
the fried green tomatoes
a little thinner.

32:48.801 --> 32:50.634
But that's just a minor point,

32:50.678 --> 32:52.302
'cause all the elements
are so well done.

32:52.346 --> 32:54.429
Thank you, chef.

33:06.777 --> 33:09.820
Mmm, yeah.

33:09.863 --> 33:11.279
- Thank you, chef.
- Gordon: Everything's there.

33:11.323 --> 33:12.823
Let me tell you,
I would love to have spent

33:12.866 --> 33:14.157
the last two minutes
with you dressing that,

33:14.201 --> 33:15.993
put it on the plate
and just elevating it.

33:16.036 --> 33:17.444
But when you have
an aioli like that,

33:17.454 --> 33:19.913
that delicious,
you don't hide it.

33:19.957 --> 33:21.915
That should be over the top
almost like icing
on top of that crab.

33:21.959 --> 33:23.917
- Okay.
- That dish has got heart.

33:23.961 --> 33:25.836
- Brilliantly done.
- Thank you.

33:25.879 --> 33:27.754
Amazing.

33:27.798 --> 33:30.048
- Good job, dorian!
- Noah: Great job.

33:30.968 --> 33:32.843
Thank you, sweetie.

33:32.886 --> 33:36.346
And the final home cook
we'd love to bring up

33:36.390 --> 33:41.143
had a very colorful
and elegant dish.

33:41.186 --> 33:43.895
Micah.

33:46.900 --> 33:48.900
Great job, micah.

33:50.612 --> 33:52.821
Micah:
<i> I'm super nervous.</i>

33:52.865 --> 33:55.490
I can't taste a single component
of my dish except my aioli.

33:55.534 --> 33:56.908
<i> But aioli doesn't win</i>
<i> challenges.</i>

33:56.952 --> 33:59.578
The entire complete dish does,

33:59.621 --> 34:01.621
<i> and I don't know</i>
<i> how it tastes.</i>

34:01.665 --> 34:04.332
I'm just praying
that it's perfect.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.168
Please, what is the dish?

34:06.211 --> 34:10.088
This is a squid ink risotto
with knuckle meat flaked in,

34:10.132 --> 34:13.550
a saffron lemon aioli
served with crab

34:13.594 --> 34:16.053
tossed in a tarragon
beurre monte sauce.

34:16.096 --> 34:19.097
- Wow.
- Micah, you've done the most
courageous thing tonight,

34:19.141 --> 34:21.850
taking squid ink
and trying to get that

34:21.894 --> 34:23.935
combined
with alaskan king crab.

34:23.979 --> 34:25.604
It's so dangerous.

34:25.647 --> 34:29.149
Squid ink,
it's super powerful,
it tastes of zinc,

34:29.193 --> 34:32.152
and really dense
and really heavy.

34:32.196 --> 34:34.488
- Shall we?
- Yes.

34:36.950 --> 34:38.617
It's just a dangerous
thing to do.

34:38.660 --> 34:41.411
Super dangerous.

34:54.551 --> 34:57.094
Micah, you've done the most
courageous thing tonight,

34:57.137 --> 34:59.596
taking squid ink
and trying to get that

34:59.640 --> 35:01.932
combined
with alaskan king crab.

35:01.975 --> 35:05.102
Squid ink,
it's super powerful,
it tastes of zinc,

35:05.145 --> 35:07.312
and really dense
and really heavy.

35:07.356 --> 35:09.064
It's so dangerous.

35:16.657 --> 35:18.323
The aioli,
what's in here?

35:18.367 --> 35:21.159
I have saffron, lemon juice,
dijon, and eggs.

35:25.999 --> 35:28.875
Here's what you did that's
so brilliant about this dish,

35:28.919 --> 35:30.961
is that you used a lemon aioli

35:31.004 --> 35:33.004
as you would finish
a risotto with butter.

35:33.048 --> 35:35.423
It's diffusing that iron-y,

35:35.467 --> 35:37.092
deep, rich flavor
of the the squid ink.

35:37.136 --> 35:39.553
Your choices have made

35:39.596 --> 35:42.180
for a very delicious,
well-balanced bite

35:42.224 --> 35:43.890
that celebrates crab.

35:43.934 --> 35:45.475
Joe:
The risotto is perfect.

35:45.519 --> 35:47.227
You nailed the risotto.

35:51.316 --> 35:54.943
- Right.
- Aarón: More crab flavor.

35:54.987 --> 35:57.154
Here's the thing,
risotto is nailed beautifully.

35:57.197 --> 35:59.614
You took 27 minutes
making that risotto.
I watched you.

35:59.658 --> 36:02.492
I felt that
across the 27 minutes,

36:02.536 --> 36:04.861
you were so close
to your risotto

36:04.872 --> 36:06.121
you were almost
making love to it.

36:06.165 --> 36:08.623
- What?
- You wouldn't let it go.

36:08.667 --> 36:09.791
Yeah.

36:09.835 --> 36:12.085
Okay.

36:12.129 --> 36:14.546
I've been told
I'm a little clingy, chef.

36:14.590 --> 36:16.464
- So...
- Nothing wrong with that.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.425
- Continue being clingy.
- Especially with your rice.

36:19.928 --> 36:21.252
Here's the shock.

36:21.263 --> 36:23.013
You're allergic
to shellfish.

36:23.056 --> 36:25.307
- You can't even taste it.
- No, chef.

36:25.342 --> 36:26.474
And I wish
that you weren't allergic

36:26.518 --> 36:28.351
because it tastes phenomenal.

36:28.395 --> 36:32.105
And so it's very rare
to get that on point

36:32.149 --> 36:33.556
when you can't taste
where you are.

36:33.567 --> 36:36.276
- Well done.
- Thank you, chefs.

36:36.320 --> 36:37.819
- Thank you, thank you.
- Good job, micah.

36:37.863 --> 36:40.363
Great job, micah.
Really great job.

36:41.617 --> 36:43.241
Morimoto just ate my food.

36:43.285 --> 36:46.786
- Right. So crazy.
- That's all I can say
that's in my head.

36:46.830 --> 36:50.624
Guys, there were some
great dishes out there
tonight, really.

36:50.667 --> 36:52.375
We now need
a moment to discuss

36:52.419 --> 36:54.035
and evaluate these dishes.

36:54.046 --> 36:55.212
- Thank you.
- Please.

36:55.255 --> 36:56.796
Noah:
<i> I'm really upset.</i>

36:56.840 --> 36:59.799
I've never tried harder
than I've tried tonight.

36:59.843 --> 37:02.552
I wanted the opportunity
to present a plate

37:02.596 --> 37:06.681
in front of morimoto and, uh,

37:06.725 --> 37:07.807
<i> and I didn't get to do that.</i>

37:07.851 --> 37:09.684
- Happy with the three?
- Yes, sir.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.102
- Happy? Excellent. Let's go.
- Yeah.

37:11.146 --> 37:12.520
- All right.
- Please.

37:14.650 --> 37:17.442
Tonight's dishes were so good

37:17.486 --> 37:20.820
that we've decided that
we are handing out immunity

37:20.864 --> 37:23.865
to not one, not two,
but three of you.

37:23.909 --> 37:26.818
That's right,
half of you will be safe

37:26.828 --> 37:28.787
and half of you,
along with everybody else
standing behind you,

37:28.830 --> 37:30.956
will be facing elimination
tomorrow.

37:30.999 --> 37:33.208
I just want to say well done.

37:33.252 --> 37:36.586
For me, the most exciting
challenge to date.

37:40.634 --> 37:43.167
Thank you very much.

37:43.178 --> 37:45.345
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you, chef.

37:45.389 --> 37:48.682
Right, the first
talented home cook

37:48.725 --> 37:50.725
heading up to the safety
of the balcony

37:50.769 --> 37:52.185
who will not face elimination,

37:52.229 --> 37:54.271
that home cook is...

37:55.440 --> 37:56.856
...Shari. Well done.

37:56.900 --> 37:59.567
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Great job, shari.

37:59.611 --> 38:02.320
Shari:
<i> I cannot get on that</i>
<i> balcony fast enough.</i>

38:02.364 --> 38:04.656
I need to get up there before
they decide they made a mistake

38:04.700 --> 38:06.032
and keep me back down.

38:06.076 --> 38:09.160
Gordon: You are safe
from tomorrow's elimination.

38:09.204 --> 38:12.330
I think that I've proven
that I can cook other cuisines,

38:12.374 --> 38:14.708
and I'm feeling good.

38:14.751 --> 38:17.752
The next home cook heading up
to the safety of the balcony

38:17.796 --> 38:20.797
that will not face elimination
also was a bit of a shock.

38:20.841 --> 38:25.510
Pretty adventurous,
somewhat daring,
but it worked.

38:25.554 --> 38:28.805
Congratulations, micah.

38:28.849 --> 38:31.057
Maybe one
of the best risottos

38:31.101 --> 38:34.019
in the ten year history
of "masterchef." spot-on.

38:34.062 --> 38:36.980
That doesn't come lightly.
That was excellent,
excellent rice.

38:37.024 --> 38:38.398
Thank you, joe.

38:38.442 --> 38:40.734
Micah:
<i> It means a lot to me</i>

38:40.777 --> 38:42.652
to win immunity
in front of morimoto.

38:42.696 --> 38:46.072
<i> I'm the youngest competitor,</i>
<i> and for him to see that</i>

38:46.116 --> 38:47.907
<i> and to reward it</i>
<i> with immunity,</i>

38:47.951 --> 38:49.951
I know that
I'm on the right path

38:49.995 --> 38:52.454
and this is what
I'm supposed to be doing.

38:52.497 --> 38:54.748
An amazing job.
How do you feel?

38:54.791 --> 38:57.709
I have no words, but thank you
all for the praise.

38:57.753 --> 38:59.836
It means a lot to me.

38:59.880 --> 39:01.212
Three of you will be entering

39:01.256 --> 39:03.131
tomorrow's
elimination challenge.

39:03.175 --> 39:06.051
Just one more spot left
up on the balcony.

39:06.094 --> 39:10.680
That spot goes to the very best
dish of the night.

39:10.724 --> 39:14.184
The home cook
who made this winning dish

39:14.227 --> 39:15.685
will receive an incredible

39:15.729 --> 39:17.979
once in a lifetime
special surprise.

39:19.649 --> 39:22.484
An invitation
from chef morimoto

39:22.527 --> 39:25.278
to come and dine
as a table of four

39:25.313 --> 39:27.697
as his guest in one
of his restaurants

39:27.741 --> 39:30.200
- anywhere in the world.
- Wow.

39:30.243 --> 39:32.535

39:47.219 --> 39:48.802
Fred:
<i> I'm on cloud nine.</i>

39:48.845 --> 39:50.553
I can't believe I just won.

39:50.597 --> 39:53.139
<i> This dish represents</i>
<i> who I am,</i>

39:53.183 --> 39:55.100
<i> and knowing</i>
<i> that they love who I am</i>

39:55.143 --> 39:57.352
strikes a very personal chord
in a good way.

39:57.396 --> 39:58.812
- Well done.

39:58.855 --> 40:00.230
