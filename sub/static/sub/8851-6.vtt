05:47.752 --> 05:49.336
Like hell he don't.

05:49.420 --> 05:51.421
He asked for me himself.

05:51.473 --> 05:54.641
And he's paying me. Just like he pays you.

05:54.726 --> 05:58.929
Only difference being, I
don't got to kill nobody.

05:58.980 --> 06:00.797
So when you coming back?

06:00.849 --> 06:04.485
Maybe I won't. Maybe I'll stay in Chicago.

06:04.569 --> 06:07.104
What do you suppose they
going to make you in Chicago?

06:07.155 --> 06:09.690
What do you mean by that?

I'm just saying, this is
where you belong, girl.

06:13.745 --> 06:16.997

Doc ain't getting on that train.

06:37.335 --> 06:40.137

Weston's on his way and that
train don't leave for two hours.

06:42.690 --> 06:44.358
I got to get him out of here right now.

06:44.442 --> 06:46.310
Thomas could die.

06:46.361 --> 06:48.612
Doc will die if I don't
get him on this horse.

06:48.679 --> 06:50.781
Now if you'll excuse me.

06:50.848 --> 06:53.367
Thomas saved your life.

06:53.451 --> 06:54.902
He saved your life,

06:54.986 --> 06:57.404
and now you're just willing to let him die?

06:57.488 --> 07:00.741
Well, look on the bright side... at least
now you won't have to share his bed no more.

07:00.825 --> 07:03.160
Don't you dare talk to me like that!

07:03.211 --> 07:04.578
Calm down.

07:04.662 --> 07:07.331
You're hurting me.

07:12.503 --> 07:15.672

07:15.723 --> 07:18.225
That right there is the man
who was going to execute me.

07:18.309 --> 07:19.977
Now he's coming for you.

07:20.044 --> 07:21.678
Finds out you're on that
train, he's going to have men

07:21.729 --> 07:24.231
waiting to arrest you in Chicago.

07:27.819 --> 07:31.721
I'm staying with my patient.

07:31.773 --> 07:34.074
They're going to kill you.

07:39.697 --> 07:43.367
Hawkins.

07:43.418 --> 07:45.035
And them boys?

07:45.086 --> 07:48.005
They robbed and they killed.

07:48.072 --> 07:52.759
And I patched them up so they
could go out and do it again.

07:56.714 --> 07:59.433
You think this is going
to make up for that?

07:59.517 --> 08:03.053
[Sighs] It's a start, son.

08:10.928 --> 08:13.947
All right, I can respect that.

08:14.032 --> 08:17.150
Just promise me... 

08:17.235 --> 08:20.103
you'll get off that train
before it gets to Chicago.

08:21.539 --> 08:23.707
I promise.

you won't see my sorry ass again.

08:54.072 --> 08:56.440
[Train horn blows]

09:15.710 --> 09:18.345
How's he doing?

09:18.429 --> 09:20.430
His fever came down a little.

09:20.498 --> 09:22.299
Good.

09:22.350 --> 09:23.833
Maybe it's breaking.

09:23.885 --> 09:26.136
Think he's going to make it?

09:27.939 --> 09:29.523
Ahh.

09:29.607 --> 09:30.840
This fever keeps breaking,

09:30.892 --> 09:33.110
he's got a good chance.

09:33.177 --> 09:36.480
He's a strong man.

09:36.531 --> 09:38.482
That surgery?

09:38.533 --> 09:41.535
It would have killed most men half his age.

09:41.619 --> 09:44.788
[Gasps]

09:44.855 --> 09:47.574
How far along are you?

09:47.658 --> 09:50.077
What?

09:50.161 --> 09:51.578
The baby.

09:51.662 --> 09:54.548
Um... 3 months,

09:54.632 --> 09:56.633
or so.

09:59.170 --> 10:02.005
You got a man?

10:02.056 --> 10:08.178
Doc, what I got is a
whole lot of heartache.

10:11.382 --> 10:13.650

[Clears throat]

[Sighs]

10:27.698 --> 10:30.417
When I woke this morning,

10:30.501 --> 10:32.919
this was laying by the end of my bed.

10:33.004 --> 10:34.871
And it was open to this page,

10:34.922 --> 10:38.125
and there was a passage marked.

10:38.209 --> 10:41.878
Jesus said to them, "if
you don't have a sword,

10:41.929 --> 10:44.014
sell your cloak to buy one."

10:44.081 --> 10:46.800
What does it mean?

10:46.884 --> 10:48.602
Have you seen father?

10:48.686 --> 10:50.137
No.

10:50.221 --> 10:52.889
What do you suppose he's up to?

10:52.940 --> 10:55.559
I don't know.

11:27.725 --> 11:29.559

11:29.627 --> 11:32.562
Keep him calm. Keep him calm.

11:32.630 --> 11:34.797
[Whooping continues]

11:36.651 --> 11:38.985
Hey! You got any firearms on board?

11:39.070 --> 11:41.321

Fine!

12:02.826 --> 12:04.678
[Groaning]

12:12.270 --> 12:15.939
The glory of the lord will be revealed,

12:16.006 --> 12:18.808
and all people will see it.

12:18.860 --> 12:22.437

12:42.171 --> 12:43.638
[Chuckles]

12:43.706 --> 12:45.332
You... you need to tell me

12:45.452 --> 12:50.061
what's going on here.

12:50.146 --> 12:52.363
Well, you'll have this manifesto

12:52.482 --> 12:56.119
published on the front page
of the "New York Tribune".

12:57.871 --> 13:01.674
You're insane.

13:01.759 --> 13:05.428
I won't do it!

13:06.680 --> 13:09.799
Everyone on board the train dies.

13:20.343 --> 13:23.146

No, please... please! Please.

13:31.872 --> 13:34.824
You... you win.

13:34.875 --> 13:37.577
You win, Reverend, you win, you win.

13:37.661 --> 13:39.528
I'll do it.

13:45.202 --> 13:49.338
That thing is going to
take hours to telegraph.

13:49.390 --> 13:51.724
I have all the time in the world.

13:51.809 --> 13:54.177
Well, I don't think he does.

13:54.228 --> 13:58.598
Well, you better just keep him alive.

13:58.682 --> 14:01.567
For your own sake, doctor.

14:04.738 --> 14:07.106
Cullen: You wanted to see me?

14:07.191 --> 14:09.158
Look at this.

14:09.226 --> 14:10.943
[Sighs]

14:11.028 --> 14:13.696
It's from Thomas' train.

14:13.747 --> 14:15.748
All of them are.

14:15.833 --> 14:19.252
How's he sending telegrams
from a moving train?

14:19.336 --> 14:22.538
I have no idea.

14:22.589 --> 14:26.575
But Thomas didn't write
it, I'm sure of that.

14:27.711 --> 14:30.847
Listen to this... 

14:30.914 --> 14:32.715
"the crimes of this guilty land

14:32.766 --> 14:34.767
can only be purged away with blood."

14:34.852 --> 14:37.553
Let me see that.

14:37.604 --> 14:39.588
[Sighs]

14:39.640 --> 14:41.858
Who'd have written this?

14:41.925 --> 14:45.528
It's John Brown.

14:45.946 --> 14:48.597
John... 

14:53.270 --> 14:55.404
Cullen: Count 3 rifles.

14:55.456 --> 14:58.207
Elam: Those our rifles?

14:58.275 --> 15:00.276
Looks like it.

15:00.327 --> 15:02.211
Eva's in there.

15:02.279 --> 15:06.966
Yeah, well, so is doc.
Get your weapon down.

15:07.050 --> 15:09.752
Need to get onboard that train and
find out what we're dealing with.

15:09.803 --> 15:13.422
Hey, you in there!

15:19.096 --> 15:21.764
That you, Bohannon?

15:21.815 --> 15:24.433
Damn it.

15:24.485 --> 15:25.985
That's right, Reverend.

15:26.069 --> 15:28.271
Need to come aboard.

15:28.322 --> 15:29.906
I think not.

15:29.973 --> 15:31.691
Please, Reverend.

15:31.775 --> 15:34.026
All I want to do is talk.

15:34.111 --> 15:36.078
See?

15:59.937 --> 16:04.106
Keep pecking on that thing, chicken man.

16:05.442 --> 16:07.143
Reverend... 

16:07.194 --> 16:11.564
What are you doing?

16:11.648 --> 16:14.534
What's going on in here? Huh?

16:15.702 --> 16:17.737
Reverend?

16:17.821 --> 16:20.239
You been drinking?

16:20.324 --> 16:23.492
Not a drop.

16:24.378 --> 16:25.912
Well... 

16:25.996 --> 16:27.380
say let me buy you one, huh?

16:27.464 --> 16:28.915
Let's go to the Starlite.

16:28.999 --> 16:31.467
How'd you know the train
had been stopped here?

16:31.534 --> 16:32.802
Council bluffs wired.

16:32.869 --> 16:34.253
Train was supposed to pull in an hour ago.

16:34.338 --> 16:36.505
So... 

16:36.557 --> 16:39.258
How's everybody else doing?

16:39.343 --> 16:42.845
They're fine.

16:42.896 --> 16:44.880
Why don't you let me take a look, Reverend?

16:44.932 --> 16:47.483
I want to make sure nobody's been hurt.

16:47.550 --> 16:50.519
- I don't think so.
- It's all right.

16:50.571 --> 16:55.908
[Speaking native language]

16:55.993 --> 16:59.745
[Speaking native language]

16:59.830 --> 17:01.747
All right, ok.

17:01.832 --> 17:03.732
That's good.

17:03.784 --> 17:06.752
That's good.

17:11.425 --> 17:14.210
Why are you doing this? Huh?

17:14.261 --> 17:17.430
You of all people should
understand the situation.

17:17.513 --> 17:20.883
We're fighting an invading force.

17:20.934 --> 17:22.935
Yes, sir.

17:23.020 --> 17:24.720
I know firsthand the firestorm

17:24.771 --> 17:27.272
that's going to rain down on these people.

17:27.357 --> 17:29.942
Killing nocents ain't going to change that.

17:30.027 --> 17:32.728
It's going to make it worse.

17:32.779 --> 17:35.898
I'm done talking.

17:35.949 --> 17:38.434
Ahem.

17:40.954 --> 17:44.907
I want you to think about
this, Reverend, all right?

17:44.958 --> 17:46.942
Pray on it.

17:48.912 --> 17:53.132
I know God will lead you
to do the right thing.

18:09.650 --> 18:12.818
Mr. Bohannon.

18:18.807 --> 18:20.818
Blood is God here.

19:11.094 --> 19:12.975
Lily: How many hostages are there?

19:13.095 --> 19:15.631
6 left.

19:17.100 --> 19:19.018
Is he drunk?

19:19.102 --> 19:20.422
Sober as a judge.

19:20.710 --> 19:22.093
Mad as a hatter.

19:22.178 --> 19:24.212
And do you think he's
willing to kill Thomas

19:24.263 --> 19:26.047
if his demands aren't met?

19:26.098 --> 19:27.766
See that body lying out there?

19:28.110 --> 19:29.360
We'll have to take him by force.

19:29.445 --> 19:30.069
I'm with him.

19:30.189 --> 19:32.663
No, I think we need to
take time to negotiate.

19:32.766 --> 19:35.435
He tried that already.
He's way past negotiating.

19:35.519 --> 19:37.937
Why do you think Durant
sent us that telegram

19:38.022 --> 19:39.522
instead of sending it on back east?

19:39.590 --> 19:42.758
- This is what he wants.
- No, this is what you want.

19:44.228 --> 19:46.946
He's in a rush to get
his friend out of there

19:47.031 --> 19:49.399
before Weston arrives, and he's
willing to put everyone else's

19:49.450 --> 19:50.700
lives at risk to do it.

19:50.767 --> 19:52.151
Is that true?

19:52.236 --> 19:56.606
You want to see eva
dumped off that train next?

19:56.657 --> 20:00.493
And how do you know Durant
won't just bleed out in there?

20:00.578 --> 20:02.445
We storm that train, I can't guarantee

20:02.496 --> 20:04.714
we'll get any of them out alive.

20:04.781 --> 20:07.250
But it's our best chance.

20:10.471 --> 20:13.756
[Dog barks in distance]

20:13.807 --> 20:15.975
[Chanting in native language]

20:26.820 --> 20:28.988
You know...

20:29.073 --> 20:33.493
we're not so different, you and I.

20:33.577 --> 20:36.446
[Chuckles] You're crazier than I am

20:36.497 --> 20:37.914
if you believe that.

20:37.981 --> 20:41.334
Well, we are both men

20:41.418 --> 20:43.786
with a mission in our life;

20:43.837 --> 20:49.092
willing to sacrifice
anything to achieve our goals.

20:50.127 --> 20:53.463
Even our own families.

20:53.514 --> 20:55.848
[Chuckles] Yeah, I've been... 

20:55.933 --> 20:58.134
I've been a terrible father.

20:58.185 --> 21:02.004
Great men often are.

21:17.454 --> 21:20.540
Do you have... do you have children?

21:20.624 --> 21:22.075
I had a son.

21:22.159 --> 21:25.294
His name was William.

21:25.362 --> 21:28.297
We lost him... 

21:28.365 --> 21:31.718
when he was 12.

21:31.802 --> 21:34.887
Cholera.

21:38.375 --> 21:41.043
My wife, uh,

21:41.095 --> 21:44.514
she's never forgiven
me for not being there.

21:44.565 --> 21:48.818
But I was building this railroad for him.

21:48.885 --> 21:50.687
Your legacy to him.

21:50.738 --> 21:53.055
Yes.

21:53.107 --> 21:56.109
That's what this is.

21:56.193 --> 22:00.029
A legacy to mine.

22:06.670 --> 22:09.422
Your legacy will be nothing but death

22:09.506 --> 22:11.124
and blood.

22:11.208 --> 22:15.962
I'm afraid that's all
you'll be remembered for.

22:16.046 --> 22:18.765
Yeah, well, that's what the
rebels said to John Brown

22:18.849 --> 22:20.933
before they hung him.

22:21.018 --> 22:24.187
There was another man

22:24.254 --> 22:29.108
willing to shed blood
for his righteous cause.

22:29.193 --> 22:34.864
His name was John Wilkes Booth.

[Chanting in native language]

22:52.382 --> 22:55.968
You are on the wrong
side of history, Reverend.

22:56.053 --> 23:02.258
The nation wants this railroad.

23:02.309 --> 23:06.095
Anyone who stands in its way

23:06.146 --> 23:08.631
will be vilified.

23:16.106 --> 23:19.108
Is that what you want for Joseph?

You can end this now, Reverend.

Do it, for your children.

I'm going to kill 'em all.

25:11.388 --> 25:13.689
You lied to me, didn't you?

25:13.757 --> 25:16.025
Yes.

25:16.092 --> 25:18.611
Did you really think

25:18.695 --> 25:22.315
I would allow your manifesto

25:22.399 --> 25:24.567
- to be published?
- Shut her up!

25:24.618 --> 25:27.370
Your fate was sealed

25:27.437 --> 25:29.071
the moment you walked in that door.

25:29.122 --> 25:31.290
Well, you sealed their
fate as well as your own.

25:31.375 --> 25:34.493
Please, let the lady go.

26:20.747 --> 26:22.170
if it was anybody but
your friend out there.

26:22.326 --> 26:24.410
What the hell are we doing
just sitting around, anyway?

26:24.495 --> 26:26.079
We need to be doing something.

26:26.163 --> 26:28.030
Just sit tight till
Ruth and Joseph get here.

26:28.082 --> 26:29.832
Sit tight?

26:29.900 --> 26:32.001

26:32.068 --> 26:33.586
He ain't giving up, he's saying good-bye.

26:33.670 --> 26:35.254
You think I ain't worried?

before Weston gets here,

27:08.605 --> 27:11.440
Well, where do you fit in?

27:11.492 --> 27:14.293
I reckon I don't.

27:15.212 --> 27:17.130
Yeah.

27:17.214 --> 27:19.632
It's probably for the best.

27:19.716 --> 27:23.669
That child ain't got
a chance in this world.

27:23.754 --> 27:27.306
But I guess you know that
better than anybody, don't you?

27:34.064 --> 27:37.984
Have you heard about the train?

27:38.068 --> 27:40.236
Yes.

27:40.303 --> 27:43.022
Is he dead?

27:43.106 --> 27:45.358
No.

27:45.442 --> 27:47.360
No, he's not.

27:47.444 --> 27:49.812
Then why are you here?

27:53.450 --> 27:55.835
He wants to see you.

27:55.919 --> 27:57.453
To see you and Joseph.

27:57.504 --> 28:01.090
Why?

28:02.342 --> 28:04.677
Don't know.

28:04.761 --> 28:08.264
Maybe you can talk him into giving up.

28:08.331 --> 28:11.634
Why would he listen to me?

28:12.803 --> 28:15.438
You're his daughter, Ruth.

28:15.505 --> 28:17.440
How can you just sit there?

28:23.113 --> 28:25.615
He hates me.

He has made that very clear

28:28.619 --> 28:31.237
- my entire life.
- Ruth...

28:31.321 --> 28:36.492
he's going to kill everyone on
that train if we don't do something.

I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do.

just do this one last thing for me.

want to talk with you.

But look... look what a... [Chuckles]

One way or the other.

Shit!

32:17.080 --> 32:19.215
We got it under control.

We don't need you here.

Well, I've come to fetch my prisoner.

32:51.081 --> 32:53.799
but only if you let these people go.

When you come back,

36:41.630 --> 36:45.580
we need to talk about that baby.

You mean your baby?

No, don't say that.

my wife.

37:43.955 --> 37:46.307
You will.

38:30.436 --> 38:32.603
Good-bye, Thomas.

38:48.019 --> 38:53.658
Being a country doctor's about
a lot more than you might think.

38:53.709 --> 38:55.910
One of my many duties

38:55.994 --> 39:00.531
is to see people out of this world.

39:00.582 --> 39:06.237
I'd hold their hand or talk to 'em.

39:06.305 --> 39:10.374
Usually I'd just listen.

39:11.677 --> 39:16.814
It was an obligation I took great pride in.

39:26.558 --> 39:31.195
Cullen... 

39:31.246 --> 39:34.999
I would be truly honored

if it was you to see me out of this world.

39:41.673 --> 39:44.241
Are you asking me to pull the trigger?

39:44.293 --> 39:46.210
Well, I sure don't want them Yankees

39:46.261 --> 39:49.430
to be the last face I see.

39:55.103 --> 39:57.605
Uh... 

39:59.424 --> 40:02.777
I can't... I can't do that.

40:07.032 --> 40:10.234
I could still bust you out of
here. You just say the word.

40:10.285 --> 40:12.453
I am not gonna let you pay the price

40:14.540 --> 40:16.240
for me running like a
cwe can go to Mexico... 

40:16.291 --> 40:17.792
Listen to me.

40:19.545 --> 40:21.913
I am done running.

40:21.964 --> 40:26.968
There's no honor in the
way I've been living.

40:31.557 --> 40:34.759
The least I can do is die with some.

41:10.596 --> 41:14.181
My 3 boys died in the war.

41:14.266 --> 41:18.519
I never got a chance to bury them.

41:20.689 --> 41:23.641
But... 

41:23.692 --> 41:26.894
I had a good life.

41:26.979 --> 41:30.147
Probably better than I deserve.

41:33.785 --> 41:36.153
You want me to read some words?

41:55.974 --> 41:57.773
I'm ready.

42:12.574 --> 42:15.576
I don't know if I can do it.

42:18.137 --> 42:21.209
You be strong, son.

42:21.519 --> 42:24.168
You be strong.
