[man]<i> I have even less reason</i>

01:34.805 --> 01:37.205
to help you influence the Doge
than I did before,

01:37.285 --> 01:40.965
when your wife played matchmaker
to my daughter and Francesco Pazzi.

01:45.965 --> 01:48.125
I was told he was an ally to the Medici.

01:48.205 --> 01:50.245
Instead, I find her returned to me
by that same husband,

01:52.445 --> 01:54.485
and he... your sworn enemy.

01:59.965 --> 02:02.645
The actions of Francesco Pazzi
were misguided

02:02.725 --> 02:05.125
and no reflection on your daughter.

02:09.565 --> 02:12.485
Duke, your men must stay here
and speak to no one.

02:12.565 --> 02:14.885
What is so urgent that I must come
to Florence in person?

02:14.965 --> 02:16.005
Please, follow me.

02:16.285 --> 02:18.405
[Lorenzo]<i> As a father, you are angry,</i>
<i>and I understand.</i>

02:19.525 --> 02:22.325
But as a servant of your city,
I implore you.

02:22.685 --> 02:24.245
Lay aside personal feelings...

02:24.325 --> 02:25.365
[door opens]

02:26.285 --> 02:27.805
Ah, Duke.

02:28.765 --> 02:30.485
-My thanks for coming.
-Why am I here?

02:31.085 --> 02:32.205
And who is this?

02:32.485 --> 02:33.685
This is Andrea Foscari.

02:34.245 --> 02:36.125
Representative of the Doge.

02:36.565 --> 02:38.365
You know what would happen
if the people of Milan knew

02:38.445 --> 02:40.205
I was meeting secretly with Venetians?

02:40.285 --> 02:42.685
I assure you the people of Venice
would feel the same

02:42.765 --> 02:44.125
about my meeting you, Duke.

02:44.205 --> 02:45.325
Gentlemen, please.

02:45.845 --> 02:46.765
Please.

02:47.805 --> 02:50.165
Can you deny the benefit to Milan...

02:50.725 --> 02:54.725
if it had unfettered access
to the sea lanes that Venice controls?

02:55.325 --> 02:58.685
Right now, the Pope can shut the gates
of Imola at any time.

02:59.445 --> 03:00.645
But would he dare...

03:00.725 --> 03:04.325
if he knew that Milan's military might
could come to our aid?

03:05.925 --> 03:07.445
[exhales] It is true.

03:10.885 --> 03:12.285
I see the arguments in favor,

03:12.565 --> 03:14.645
but I can't countenance such a treaty.

03:15.245 --> 03:18.845
It does not matter if an alliance between
our cities is conceived as defensive,

03:18.925 --> 03:20.805
Sixtus would see it as a threat.

03:21.605 --> 03:23.605
And Milan cannot risk making
an enemy of the Pope.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.645
Without Sforza, there can be no alliance.

03:34.005 --> 03:37.805
The security it will bring
cannot risk political change here.

03:44.085 --> 03:45.405
[Giuliano] What's going on?

03:46.965 --> 03:48.045
[Lorenzo] Pazzi.

03:48.325 --> 03:50.805
Stirring up political unrest
in Città di Castello.

03:51.085 --> 03:53.285
Getting people to turn
against the Gonfaloniere.

03:53.405 --> 03:54.525
To what end?

03:54.885 --> 03:58.685
Now, technically, the city is part
of the Papal states, but...

03:59.525 --> 04:01.845
it's been under Florentine protection
for years.

04:02.205 --> 04:04.005
Gonfaloniere there is corrupt.

04:04.365 --> 04:06.805
Your father should've got rid of him
years ago, and he never did.

04:07.765 --> 04:09.645
Let me go, find out what's happening.

04:11.245 --> 04:12.405
You sure?

04:12.485 --> 04:14.045
[Giuliano] You're not the only Medici.
For a time, it felt like it.

04:16.925 --> 04:18.925
Why the sudden desire to serve?

04:19.005 --> 04:20.245
You question my motive?

04:21.885 --> 04:25.245
Sandro tells me that you're in love
with Simonetta Vespucci...

04:28.805 --> 04:30.125
There are so many.

04:31.245 --> 04:32.605
I forget their names.

05:05.325 --> 05:07.645
[Pope]<i> Who will judge</i>
<i>these people of yours?</i>

05:09.045 --> 05:11.325
Your understanding heart

05:12.125 --> 05:14.085
must talk to us all.

05:17.485 --> 05:18.685
[Gonfaloniere] See for yourself.

05:18.765 --> 05:20.725
There is no trouble in Città di Castello.

05:21.565 --> 05:24.365
These are nasty rumors meant to
undermine your support.

05:27.325 --> 05:32.005
You are to know good from evil.

05:51.205 --> 05:52.445
[clamoring]

05:57.005 --> 05:59.685
[Salviati]<i> Giuliano de' Medici narrowly</i>
<i>escaped a riot there this morning.</i>

05:59.765 --> 06:02.565
Città di Castello is on the brink
of a massacre.

06:02.645 --> 06:04.565
[Sixtus] I will send an envoy to mediate.

06:04.845 --> 06:07.005
Holiness, the time for mediation
has come and gone

06:07.085 --> 06:08.445
on Florence's watch.

06:08.525 --> 06:10.805
The wolves have already
set about your flock.

06:11.325 --> 06:13.245
There is only one option left.

06:15.205 --> 06:17.325
Raise an army to enter the city?

06:18.205 --> 06:20.445
I purchased Imola with Pazzi money.

06:20.765 --> 06:23.365
The building works I've started
must be paid for.

06:23.925 --> 06:27.925
I'm besieged by family members begging
for riches and advancement.

06:28.365 --> 06:30.365
Some I did not even know I had.
Kill two birds with one stone.

06:34.165 --> 06:37.805
Give command of the army to your nephew,
Cardinal della Rovere,

06:37.885 --> 06:39.965
and when Città di Castello falls,

06:40.525 --> 06:43.525
let it pay him and your army's wages.

06:52.365 --> 06:53.565
[bell dings]

06:53.645 --> 06:54.885
[Lorenzo] My brother...

06:55.845 --> 06:56.685
[man] Sit down.

06:56.765 --> 07:01.485
[Lorenzo] My brother has just returned
from Città di Castello.

07:02.485 --> 07:04.965
It's true. There is unrest.

07:06.845 --> 07:11.205
Vitelli and his corrupt colleagues
have been overtaxing its citizens,

07:11.525 --> 07:15.565
and there can be little doubt that others
have exploited this to foment trouble

07:15.645 --> 07:17.645
and turn the Pope against us.

07:17.725 --> 07:19.125
You have proof?

07:20.885 --> 07:22.325
[man] Where is your proof?

07:24.325 --> 07:25.405
[Petrucci] Gentlemen...

07:29.165 --> 07:30.765
let him finish.

07:31.645 --> 07:35.405
Giuliano advised Vitelli
to lower his taxes,

07:35.845 --> 07:37.805
and he donated money
to provide for the poor.

07:37.885 --> 07:39.525
Too little, too late.

07:40.765 --> 07:45.645
Once more, Lorenzo
and the Medici family have failed us.

07:45.725 --> 07:47.805
Furthermore, I have been advised

07:47.885 --> 07:50.885
that the Pope's army
already advances on the city.

07:52.805 --> 07:53.885
[bell dings]

07:55.045 --> 07:58.365
[Petrucci] He sent his brother there
to investigate and ended the corruption.
What more could Lorenzo have done?

08:05.605 --> 08:07.445
Gonfaloniere Petrucci,

08:07.525 --> 08:10.285
are you not supposed to remain neutral?

08:10.365 --> 08:13.445
Signor Pazzi, withdraw that remark.

08:13.925 --> 08:15.005
I will not.

08:16.285 --> 08:18.285
Instead, I announce...

08:18.765 --> 08:21.125
I will run against you
in the forthcoming elections.

08:21.205 --> 08:22.285
[Francesco] Well, yes!

08:22.405 --> 08:24.965
Let's have a Gonfaloniere
that serves the city...

08:26.205 --> 08:27.565
not the Medici.

08:40.645 --> 08:43.885
[Clarice] Surely, Jacopo will never get
the majority he needs to win the election.

08:43.965 --> 08:46.205
[Luca] You've underestimated him before,
Lorenzo.

08:46.285 --> 08:49.205
[Lucrezia] If there's one thing
Jacopo Pazzi can do, it's fight dirty.

08:49.285 --> 08:51.565
He knows everyone's price.
Nobody can be counted on.

08:51.645 --> 08:53.325
[Luca] This is just what Jacopo wants,

08:53.405 --> 08:56.405
and some are not happy
that we haven't taken a stronger stance

08:56.485 --> 08:57.805
on Città di Castello.

09:00.285 --> 09:01.765
Are you among them?

09:04.605 --> 09:06.605
[Luca] Lorenzo, I...

09:07.965 --> 09:09.085
[Lorenzo] I know Sixtus.

09:10.885 --> 09:13.165
Confrontation will only make
matters worse.

09:13.485 --> 09:16.565
We must play Jacopo at his own game
and fight dirty.

09:16.645 --> 09:18.885
I will fight Jacopo with everything
that I have...

09:19.445 --> 09:21.165
but only if it is legitimate.

09:21.485 --> 09:22.765
Then how will you stop him?

09:22.845 --> 09:25.885
Jacopo believes
the Medici bank is wounded

09:25.965 --> 09:27.845
after the loss of the papal accounts.

09:27.925 --> 09:29.565
By taking over the leadership
of the Priori,

09:29.645 --> 09:33.165
he intends to destroy this family
once and for all.

09:33.245 --> 09:34.565
So, we act quickly.

09:34.645 --> 09:38.325
We make sure of the support we have,
and we win over any others that we can.

09:41.845 --> 09:43.525
Let me speak with Marco Vespucci.

09:50.845 --> 09:53.085
Very well... but tread carefully.

09:57.725 --> 09:59.485
I will call on Ardinghelli myself.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.605
[Marco]<i> Thank you very much</i>
<i>for the visit, Giuliano,</i>

10:09.685 --> 10:11.005
but it wasn't necessary.

10:11.085 --> 10:13.565
There is no question of my loyalty
to your family.

10:15.925 --> 10:17.605
Thank you, Messer Vespucci.

10:19.605 --> 10:23.965
Lorenzo, it has been a long time
since you called on us.

10:28.045 --> 10:29.765
I can guess what brings you here.

10:32.445 --> 10:34.285
And may I ask your answer?

10:36.005 --> 10:40.005
Petrucci interfered with my relations
with the Court of Constantinople.

10:40.525 --> 10:43.165
My business dealings
have been hurt as a result.

10:43.245 --> 10:44.605
The answer is no.

10:47.405 --> 10:48.525
I see.

10:50.445 --> 10:55.045
You understand this would not be a vote
for Petrucci or for me...

10:56.045 --> 10:57.285
but for Florence.

10:58.965 --> 11:00.805
I will not support the Pazzi,

11:01.365 --> 11:03.325
but neither can I support Petrucci.

11:04.045 --> 11:05.525
I will abstain.

11:06.045 --> 11:07.605
I am sorry, Lorenzo.

11:13.405 --> 11:15.205
Then, I will take my leave.

11:20.245 --> 11:21.885
[Marco]<i> Give your brother my respects.</i>

11:22.605 --> 11:23.845
And mine...

11:24.205 --> 11:25.485
to your wife.

11:26.685 --> 11:29.805
Unfortunately today, she is indisposed.

11:32.005 --> 11:33.005
Nothing serious, I hope.

11:33.365 --> 11:36.085
I have summoned a physician
from Padua just to be safe.

11:50.285 --> 11:51.285
[knock on door]

11:53.445 --> 11:54.605
[woman coughing]

12:06.325 --> 12:07.445
Giuliano!

12:07.885 --> 12:09.325
-Don't get up.
-You shouldn't be here.

12:09.405 --> 12:10.365
Leave us.

12:12.005 --> 12:13.525
Giuliano, please...
What are you doing here anyway?

12:15.845 --> 12:17.725
I'm here on business.

12:18.325 --> 12:20.965
I have just returned
from Città di Castello.

12:21.245 --> 12:24.565
I'm glad you have taken your place
as a Medici alongside your brother.

12:25.325 --> 12:27.725
I can be both, a Medici...

12:28.565 --> 12:30.405
and in love with you, Simonetta.

12:37.085 --> 12:38.885
Is that what you are doing?

12:40.285 --> 12:41.765
Trying to prove it to me?

12:44.325 --> 12:45.285
Why else?

12:46.885 --> 12:48.765
We can never be, Giuliano.

12:49.805 --> 12:50.885
Why can you not see it?

12:51.085 --> 12:53.605
Did what we have mean so little

12:53.965 --> 12:56.925
that you can just throw it aside?

13:01.565 --> 13:03.205
It was a way of passing time.
But you and I were nothing.

13:08.645 --> 13:09.885
Less than nothing.

13:13.205 --> 13:14.645
You must leave.

13:21.125 --> 13:22.525
Very well, Ma donna.

13:24.005 --> 13:25.925
I'm sorry to trouble you.

13:47.765 --> 13:48.925
[coughing]

13:57.045 --> 13:58.085
[Jacopo] Well...

14:01.685 --> 14:02.805
Is that not enough?

14:02.885 --> 14:04.485
Throw all the gold you like at me.

14:04.565 --> 14:06.085
I will not betray the Medici.

14:07.645 --> 14:09.125
Is that so, Luca?

14:12.485 --> 14:14.685
How times change, hmm?

14:14.765 --> 14:18.925
Seems only yesterday you helped plan
the attempt on Piero's life.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.045
Did it slip your mind?

14:21.685 --> 14:24.405
You know, I don't think Lorenzo ever knew.

14:28.845 --> 14:30.485
If you want it to stay that way...

14:31.445 --> 14:33.405
you will vote for me, Soderini.

14:40.885 --> 14:42.485
You can have my vote...

14:43.485 --> 14:44.965
but keep your gold.

14:57.525 --> 14:59.205
[Clarice] How was Ardinghelli?

15:00.325 --> 15:01.405
[Lorenzo] Mm-hmm.

15:01.885 --> 15:04.085
His wife saw
that I got what I deserved.

15:06.685 --> 15:08.725
Losing you must've hurt her very much.

15:11.245 --> 15:13.845
Ah, we still face so many problems.

15:14.725 --> 15:16.165
-[baby coos]
-[shushing]

15:16.285 --> 15:18.605
So now, you can do nothing about Milan?

15:20.085 --> 15:22.805
The matter of Città di Castello
is more pressing.

15:23.885 --> 15:26.125
Could you not talk to Sixtus face-to-face?

15:27.925 --> 15:29.325
You have much in common.

15:31.645 --> 15:33.165
[horse galloping]

15:45.005 --> 15:46.925
He's agreed to a private meeting?

15:48.045 --> 15:50.485
Not in so many words, no.

15:55.445 --> 15:56.685
[men praying]

16:05.445 --> 16:08.245
[praying in Latin]

16:08.525 --> 16:09.645
Amen.

16:26.885 --> 16:31.085
[praying in Latin]

16:33.885 --> 16:34.845
Amen.

16:38.125 --> 16:39.605
[hooded man] Forgive me, Father...

16:41.645 --> 16:43.165
for I have sinned.

16:45.805 --> 16:48.205
I have committed many, many sins.

16:50.205 --> 16:51.765
My greatest regret...

16:53.605 --> 16:56.725
was not preventing the death
of hundreds of innocents of Volterra.

17:09.565 --> 17:10.565
Your Holiness...

17:13.124 --> 17:14.604
I had to speak with you alone.

17:15.685 --> 17:17.084
I was told you would not allow it.

17:22.364 --> 17:25.005
I know you mourn
the lives lost at Volterra.

17:25.565 --> 17:28.124
As I know that your actions
in regards to Città di Castello

17:28.205 --> 17:29.925
were made in good faith.

17:30.205 --> 17:34.485
We both have a duty for care
to those who look to us for leadership.

17:35.805 --> 17:38.245
The Curia is grateful to Florence

17:38.325 --> 17:41.765
for its help and guidance
to Città di Castello over the years.

17:42.285 --> 17:45.325
But now, it is time for its citizens

17:45.405 --> 17:47.325
to return to the papal fold.

17:48.365 --> 17:50.845
Unadvised, the Gonfaloniere Vitelli,

17:50.925 --> 17:53.125
is using his position
to exploit citizens.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.205
As have the enemy of the Medici.

17:59.525 --> 18:01.085
And you have to understand

18:01.165 --> 18:03.525
that Vitelli will not open
his gates to you.

18:04.365 --> 18:07.365
Your army will have to sack that city,
and I cannot allow it.

18:07.965 --> 18:10.005
-Not after Volterra.
-Lorenzo...

18:10.605 --> 18:12.525
when you split the papal account,

18:12.605 --> 18:15.845
I did not insist on revoking
the alum contract...

18:16.565 --> 18:19.165
because I believe you're trying
to do good.

18:20.645 --> 18:24.325
That is why I have always sought
to be your friend.

18:25.885 --> 18:27.445
Can that still not be?

18:30.845 --> 18:31.885
I hope so.

18:33.445 --> 18:36.565
But I see no reason to change my mind
on this matter.

18:40.685 --> 18:43.005
Your Holiness, I know
you have given command

18:43.085 --> 18:44.165
of your army to your nephew,

18:44.245 --> 18:47.205
but is it not possible
that on this one occasion,

18:47.285 --> 18:49.765
your deep sense of love
and duty towards your family

18:49.845 --> 18:51.845
has led you to make the wrong decision?

18:54.685 --> 18:57.165
Who are you to judge me?

18:57.245 --> 18:58.925
I'm not judging you, Your Holiness.
God gave you a great intellect,

19:01.405 --> 19:03.165
but you use it to challenge...

19:03.525 --> 19:05.645
I, the Holy Father.

19:05.725 --> 19:07.525
You got power too young...

19:08.645 --> 19:11.205
because you stole it
from a weak father,

19:11.805 --> 19:13.205
and now you abuse it.

19:14.805 --> 19:17.485
Money buys many things,

19:17.725 --> 19:19.005
but not humility.

19:21.565 --> 19:24.485
Go back to Florence,
and do not come here again.

19:57.245 --> 19:58.885
Thank you for receiving me.

20:00.525 --> 20:02.805
There is no point
in our feigning friendship.

20:02.885 --> 20:04.005
I'm not.

20:05.165 --> 20:06.645
As I believe you were not

20:06.725 --> 20:09.245
when you showed me great kindness
on the day of my wedding feast.

20:10.525 --> 20:13.005
You can tell Lorenzo
my husband will not change his mind.

20:13.125 --> 20:14.285
Lorenzo didn't send me.

20:18.405 --> 20:21.045
So, it is to please him that you are here.

20:22.565 --> 20:25.525
Humiliating yourself before the woman
he deceived.

20:27.765 --> 20:29.205
He did not deceive you.

20:31.805 --> 20:32.965
He loved you.

20:34.565 --> 20:36.565
If he told you that, he lied.

20:37.645 --> 20:38.765
He didn't tell me.

20:39.485 --> 20:42.045
I found these amongst his books
in his study.

20:49.445 --> 20:50.445
Poems?

20:51.325 --> 20:52.485
Written for you.

20:58.365 --> 21:00.005
Why are you giving them to me?

21:01.165 --> 21:03.885
If you ever loved him back,
do not stand in his way.

21:05.845 --> 21:08.925
What he does now, he does not for himself,
but for all of us.

21:30.725 --> 21:31.925
[coughing]

21:41.445 --> 21:42.845
[Marco] You may go now, Botticelli.

21:43.285 --> 21:46.045
I will ask Lorenzo to see you receive
the balance of your payment.

21:46.125 --> 21:47.605
No, no, you have me wrong.

21:47.685 --> 21:49.085
I beg you. You must believe me.

21:49.165 --> 21:51.565
My intentions with your wife
were entirely pure.

21:52.565 --> 21:53.725
Let me paint her again.

21:53.805 --> 21:55.245
Please, I beg you to consent.

21:55.565 --> 21:58.205
I do not, and I will not.

21:58.285 --> 21:59.245
[coughs]

21:59.725 --> 22:01.205
It is finished then?

22:01.285 --> 22:03.925
My darling, you should be resting.

22:07.845 --> 22:09.005
May I see it?

22:11.365 --> 22:12.885
[Marco] That is why I had it delivered...

22:13.645 --> 22:15.285
to raise your spirits.

22:16.685 --> 22:17.765
Go on.

22:32.445 --> 22:33.445
Maestro!

22:47.285 --> 22:50.885
It is so-- I do not have words.

23:00.485 --> 23:01.525
Thank you.

23:04.205 --> 23:07.765
I must be allowed to supervise
the placement of the painting.

23:08.765 --> 23:10.085
Marco, please.

23:13.205 --> 23:14.365
[Marco] Very well.

23:15.005 --> 23:16.285
[chirping]

23:17.205 --> 23:18.525
[Simonetta coughing]

23:21.165 --> 23:22.205
Softly.

23:22.605 --> 23:24.405
[continues coughing]

23:26.925 --> 23:28.245
You are not well, Ma donna.

23:28.325 --> 23:29.885
It is nothing, Maestro.

23:30.165 --> 23:32.085
Nothing that this cannot cure.

23:35.285 --> 23:38.245
I'm sorry that my husband punishes you
for our sins.

23:43.125 --> 23:44.285
[coughs]

23:46.485 --> 23:47.725
This is serious.

23:50.645 --> 23:53.085
Promise me you will say nothing
to Giuliano.

23:54.125 --> 23:55.125
[bird chirps]

23:55.405 --> 23:56.445
[footsteps approach]

24:07.925 --> 24:10.405
There, you need never return.

24:37.325 --> 24:39.405
[Lorenzo, voice-over]
<i>You dropped me without pity.</i>

24:41.085 --> 24:42.805
<i>So listless and so pale.</i>

24:44.285 --> 24:46.685
<i>An omen true of life's brief vale,</i>

24:47.205 --> 24:48.405
<i>left lank and limp,</i>
<i>bereft my beauty.</i>

24:52.925 --> 24:56.165
<i>Now I can dwell only</i>
<i>when you plunged me into barren grief.</i>

25:02.165 --> 25:05.045
<i>Me, sweet martyr of malice...</i>

25:07.285 --> 25:11.045
<i>And were I not to remember again</i>
<i>an anxious lover's pet relief,</i>

25:12.645 --> 25:14.685
<i>death would hugely fail us.</i>

25:29.725 --> 25:30.885
Luca...
Luca Soderini,

25:34.205 --> 25:36.365
how goes the vote for the Gonfaloniere?

25:41.565 --> 25:42.685
Lorenzo.
[Lorenzo] What's wrong?

25:47.805 --> 25:48.805
Nothing.

25:48.885 --> 25:50.165
Luca, Luca...

25:51.125 --> 25:53.325
do we have the votes to stop Jacopo Pazzi?

25:54.965 --> 25:56.165
Speak to me.

25:57.205 --> 25:59.925
You are a friend, as you were my father's.

26:00.645 --> 26:01.605
Father.

26:04.405 --> 26:06.445
I must support Jacopo Pazzi.

26:15.045 --> 26:16.085
You'd betray me?

26:19.085 --> 26:20.365
You cannot do this.

26:22.045 --> 26:23.365
My mind is made up.

26:28.045 --> 26:29.325
How did he get to you?

26:30.125 --> 26:32.165
[shouting] Hmm? How did he get to you?

26:33.485 --> 26:34.605
Come on.

26:42.045 --> 26:44.565
You support
whoever your conscience dictates.

26:51.445 --> 26:54.405
Father... why?

27:14.485 --> 27:15.365
Francesco.

27:18.845 --> 27:19.645
Come.

27:28.485 --> 27:30.405
You should have rode Soderini
down in the street.

27:30.485 --> 27:32.685
Without his support, we will lose.

27:32.765 --> 27:35.165
We might as well leave Florence
before we're thrown out.

27:35.845 --> 27:36.645
No.

27:36.925 --> 27:40.125
There are still those who will
desert Jacopo and support Petrucci.

27:40.205 --> 27:42.365
If we can deliver the treaty
with Venice, and Milan.

27:42.445 --> 27:44.365
Guaranteeing the city's future safety.

27:46.445 --> 27:48.245
I will have to persuade Sforza myself.

27:48.765 --> 27:49.885
You're needed elsewhere.

27:50.525 --> 27:52.885
Papal army are within hours
of Città di Castello.

27:52.965 --> 27:54.845
I know. I know. Sixtus would not listen.

27:55.165 --> 27:58.165
-So? Leave Vitelli to his fate.
-And the people?

27:59.205 --> 28:01.245
Florence has long been
that city's protector.

28:03.685 --> 28:05.085
It cannot be another Volterra.

28:08.485 --> 28:10.765
I will write to Città di Castello.
You write to Milan.

28:10.845 --> 28:12.285
Get the duke to sign that treaty.

28:12.365 --> 28:13.845
-Lorenzo...
-[Lucrezia] Giuliano.

28:13.965 --> 28:16.165
Your family needs you.
You'll do as your brother asks.

28:17.205 --> 28:20.845
How do I persuade Sforza?
What has changed?

28:25.765 --> 28:26.765
I will write a letter.

28:28.085 --> 28:30.845
Neither of us
can afford to fail in this, brother.

28:32.765 --> 28:34.965
[Marco] After the election
of the Gonfaloniere,

28:35.045 --> 28:36.405
I must go to Genoa on business.

28:38.365 --> 28:39.525
[coughing]

28:40.365 --> 28:41.925
You might come along?

28:44.125 --> 28:46.045
The sea air would do you good.

28:46.925 --> 28:49.165
It would be good to get out of the city.

28:50.325 --> 28:53.725
[man] Messer, Ma donna,
a visitor, Francesco Pazzi.

28:57.565 --> 28:58.645
Let him enter.

29:00.285 --> 29:01.485
[footsteps approach]

29:02.885 --> 29:04.205
[birds chirping]

29:04.645 --> 29:05.765
I'm sorry to bother you.

29:06.805 --> 29:08.085
What is it you want?

29:11.885 --> 29:13.005
I'm tired.

29:25.605 --> 29:28.165
If you are here to convince me
to vote for your uncle,

29:28.805 --> 29:30.005
you are wasting your time.

29:30.805 --> 29:32.605
Well, once you know what I know...

29:35.565 --> 29:37.245
you'll need no convincing.

29:40.845 --> 29:42.325
It stares you in the face.

30:06.205 --> 30:08.405
Do you think me a ridiculous man?

30:09.125 --> 30:10.205
What do you mean?

30:12.605 --> 30:14.045
Giuliano de' Medici.

30:33.525 --> 30:34.645
It is finished.

30:42.765 --> 30:43.845
Do you love him?

30:55.285 --> 30:56.485
Do you love him?

30:58.885 --> 30:59.805
I can forgive you.

31:01.085 --> 31:03.645
But only if you tell me
you do not love him.

31:13.885 --> 31:16.165
[Simonetta] No! You're hurting me!

31:19.045 --> 31:21.885
[panting] Please, let me go.

31:21.965 --> 31:22.765
[Marco] Move!

31:25.645 --> 31:27.005
[Simonetta] Stop, please!

31:28.205 --> 31:30.285
-Move.
-Marco, please stop.

31:35.445 --> 31:36.925
-[Simonetta panting]
-[Marco grunting]

31:45.125 --> 31:48.925
You will remain here
until I've decided what to do with you.

31:51.245 --> 31:52.725
[Simonetta coughing]

32:00.525 --> 32:04.245
-[door closing]
-[keys jangling]

32:35.605 --> 32:39.045
This letter from Lorenzo
asks me to defy Sixtus.

32:39.125 --> 32:41.365
-He is only a man.
-[Bona] He is Pope.

32:41.765 --> 32:46.045
And if my husband makes an enemy of him,
he will alienate his own citizens.

32:46.125 --> 32:47.125
[dogs barking]

32:48.645 --> 32:50.005
I don't have time for this.

32:58.445 --> 33:01.085
I'm not a politician.
I don't have my brother's silver tongue,

33:01.165 --> 33:04.365
so, I'll speak plainly,
in case you missed the point.

33:04.885 --> 33:09.605
If you do not agree to this treaty, Milan
may find itself in a precarious position.

33:09.685 --> 33:13.245
-[Bona] How so?
-[Giuliano] Venice will remain a rival,

33:13.325 --> 33:18.005
an enemy on one side, on the other side,
you'll no longer have Florence as an ally.

33:18.365 --> 33:20.445
-You threaten me?
-No at all, Duke.

33:21.925 --> 33:25.885
Without this treaty,
my family will lose control of Florence

33:25.965 --> 33:27.325
in the upcoming election.

33:27.405 --> 33:29.245
We'll be replaced by the Pazzi...

33:29.845 --> 33:32.605
who despise you for supporting my father,

33:32.685 --> 33:36.805
my brother, and are allied to the Pope,
who's about to take Città di Castello

33:36.885 --> 33:39.605
and will only continue
to expand the papal states.

33:41.685 --> 33:44.245
That's the choice that faces you, Duke.

33:58.085 --> 33:59.325
[Luca] I've changed my mind.

33:59.525 --> 34:01.405
-I cannot betray Lorenzo.
-[Jacopo] Why?

34:01.485 --> 34:04.165
-You betrayed his father.
-Piero was weak.

34:04.605 --> 34:06.165
And I feared for the city.
But Lorenzo is strong.

34:08.845 --> 34:09.885
You think...

34:10.765 --> 34:13.365
they'll forgive you for trying
to have his father killed.

34:13.525 --> 34:14.445
He may.

34:15.405 --> 34:17.365
For that is the kind of man he is.

34:19.045 --> 34:20.485
But even if he does not...

34:21.125 --> 34:24.045
I will know I've done
the right thing by opposing you.

34:25.405 --> 34:28.045
And you cannot be persuaded otherwise?

34:28.605 --> 34:30.045
-No.
-At any cost?

34:30.845 --> 34:33.005
-No, Jacopo, I'm sorry, but--
-It's all right.

34:36.085 --> 34:37.684
He's an honest man. [laughs]

34:38.244 --> 34:40.204
I respect that, Luca. I do.

34:42.005 --> 34:45.684
Ah. Well, there is nothing more
to be said. You may leave us.

36:03.005 --> 36:04.085
[man] Oh, my God!

36:04.245 --> 36:05.925
[indistinct chatter]

36:55.885 --> 36:57.005
[guard] An intruder!

36:59.565 --> 37:00.605
Get him now!

37:00.685 --> 37:01.685
[guard 2] Move!

37:03.485 --> 37:04.965
I must speak to the cardinal!

37:05.045 --> 37:07.805
I must speak to the cardinal!
I'm Lorenzo de' Medici.

37:08.485 --> 37:10.925
-[della Rovere] Release him!
-[man] Get him on his feet.

37:19.485 --> 37:20.525
[Lorenzo] Your Eminence.

37:20.725 --> 37:23.725
You're too late, Lorenzo.
Vitelli refuses to surrender.

37:24.485 --> 37:27.445
Let me speak with him.
Persuade him to open the gates.

37:27.525 --> 37:28.845
He had his chance.

37:29.285 --> 37:31.725
I have promised my men
we will sack the city.

37:31.845 --> 37:35.165
If Vitelli agrees to pay you
a bounty, your men will be well,

37:35.245 --> 37:37.485
well paid gentlemen.

37:37.605 --> 37:39.365
And they won't even have to fight.

37:39.685 --> 37:41.165
He will never agree.

37:41.845 --> 37:45.765
He knows Sixtus must replace him
in order to bring peace to the city.

37:49.805 --> 37:50.685
Let me try.

37:57.325 --> 37:58.645
You have one hour.

38:06.445 --> 38:08.165
[bell clanging]

38:11.805 --> 38:12.765
[inaudible]

38:25.525 --> 38:27.205
Father! Father!

38:28.125 --> 38:29.765
Father! Father!

38:36.925 --> 38:37.765
Father!

38:49.965 --> 38:51.085
[Lorenzo] Open the gates!

38:51.485 --> 38:53.325
It's Lorenzo de' Medici.

39:02.765 --> 39:04.125
[door opening]

39:37.965 --> 39:40.365
Is this the army
Florence sends to our aid?

39:40.645 --> 39:42.205
A single Medici?

39:44.205 --> 39:46.245
And he offers you more than an army.

39:47.085 --> 39:48.525
Offers you the chance of peace.

39:49.005 --> 39:50.245
We're done talking.

39:50.845 --> 39:53.245
If they wish to take our city,
let them try.

39:53.325 --> 39:55.005
[dogs barking]

39:55.645 --> 39:58.885
If that's what Vitelli wants,
your corrupt Gonfaloniere,

39:58.965 --> 40:00.645
'cause he knows he's got nothing to lose.

40:01.685 --> 40:02.885
Is that what you want?

40:04.525 --> 40:05.605
You know...

40:05.965 --> 40:07.645
that that gate is strong...

40:09.365 --> 40:10.605
but that it won't hold.

40:12.085 --> 40:16.005
You cannot stand
against an army that its soldiers...

40:16.805 --> 40:18.125
will come into your homes...

40:19.125 --> 40:20.325
they'll kill your children...

40:21.525 --> 40:24.045
that they will rape your wives,

40:24.125 --> 40:26.125
and your daughters.
Is that what you want?

40:26.605 --> 40:28.525
If you open that gate now...

40:29.525 --> 40:31.245
those soldiers will do the same.

40:33.085 --> 40:34.365
Then pay a bounty.

40:36.765 --> 40:41.005
Ruin our city by paying for
the privilege to be the Pope's vassals?

40:47.205 --> 40:48.445
There is another way.
[door opening]

42:13.045 --> 42:15.205
[Lucrezia] How did you convince
Vitelli to pay the ransom?

42:15.485 --> 42:16.525
I didn't.

42:17.005 --> 42:18.445
-Our bank will.
-[Lucrezia sighs]

42:18.645 --> 42:21.365
It is already weakened
by the loss of the papal account.

42:21.845 --> 42:23.565
But the people of the city will live.

42:23.765 --> 42:26.285
The Priori will only see
that Florence has effectively yielded

42:26.365 --> 42:27.525
its influence to the Pope.

42:33.565 --> 42:34.365
[Lorenzo] Well?

42:34.805 --> 42:36.045
Sforza agreed.

42:38.285 --> 42:40.525
Then we have a chance to stop Jacopo.

42:40.845 --> 42:42.165
Well done, Brother.

42:43.685 --> 42:46.525
It won't be enough
to turn the Priori our way.

42:47.685 --> 42:48.485
Why not?

42:52.765 --> 42:54.165
Soderini is murdered.

42:54.685 --> 42:55.605
What?

42:56.365 --> 42:58.205
The people believe it was on your orders.

42:58.525 --> 42:59.445
My God.

42:59.605 --> 43:02.005
They knew that he'd promise
his support to the Pazzi.

43:04.205 --> 43:07.045
Vespucci has also declared for Jacopo.

43:07.645 --> 43:08.565
Why?

43:09.085 --> 43:10.845
Because of your affair with his wife.

43:25.965 --> 43:27.245
[horse neighing]

43:33.885 --> 43:35.645
-Where is she?
-Get out of my house.

43:37.725 --> 43:40.205
-Where is she?
-That is none of your business!

43:40.525 --> 43:42.005
I am her husband.

43:49.605 --> 43:51.045
Where is she?

43:53.845 --> 43:57.525
If you've hurt her, I will kill you.

43:59.765 --> 44:01.645
-[door opening]
-[keys jangling]

44:07.925 --> 44:09.725
-[Simonetta coughing]
-[Giuliano] Simonetta.
-What have you done?
-What have I done?

44:18.325 --> 44:21.805
All I asked was that she say,
she did not love you.

44:22.205 --> 44:24.565
-This is your doing.
-Fetch her physician.

44:26.245 --> 44:27.125
Go.

44:28.925 --> 44:30.005
Now!

44:34.285 --> 44:35.125
Come here.

44:38.525 --> 44:40.005
[Simonetta breathing heavily]

44:40.205 --> 44:42.965
-Come with me.
-It's too late.

44:47.285 --> 44:49.965
Why didn't you just tell him
what he wanted to hear?

44:53.485 --> 44:54.805
I could not.

45:03.285 --> 45:04.845
Why did you push me away?

45:12.845 --> 45:14.045
You're a Medici.

45:15.125 --> 45:18.165
-First and last.
-No, no.

45:20.005 --> 45:21.445
I am yours.

45:24.285 --> 45:25.125
Yeah.

45:38.285 --> 45:39.165
[inaudible]

46:43.605 --> 46:44.725
[woman] Lorenzo.

46:48.005 --> 46:49.005
What are you doing here?

46:50.685 --> 46:52.045
I have something to return.

47:00.285 --> 47:01.405
Where did you get these?

47:02.565 --> 47:03.845
Clarice.

47:05.045 --> 47:07.445
She wanted me to know
that you loved me once.

47:08.245 --> 47:11.405
And asked me to persuade
my husband to support Petrucci.

47:14.805 --> 47:15.645
He will.

47:24.965 --> 47:26.005
I'm sorry.

47:27.205 --> 47:28.605
If I ever hurt you.

47:31.445 --> 47:32.405
Thank you.

47:34.005 --> 47:35.925
I did this for your wife.

47:56.405 --> 47:57.605
Bastiano.

48:02.085 --> 48:03.085
Bastiano!

48:04.885 --> 48:07.085
[indistinct chatter]

48:16.925 --> 48:20.445
[Petrucci] Signore Priori,
thank you all for being here.

48:21.285 --> 48:24.525
Let us proceed
with the vote for Gonfaloniere.
So, we won't be discussing
the murder of Luca Soderini?

48:29.965 --> 48:31.245
By hands unknown.

48:32.405 --> 48:35.245
Or the debacle at Città di Castello?

48:36.365 --> 48:38.765
Gentlemen, it no longer matters

48:39.405 --> 48:42.045
if Sixtus holds Città di Castello...

48:42.765 --> 48:45.605
as Florence has never been
more secure than it is today.

48:46.045 --> 48:47.605
[Jacopo scoffs] How so?

48:50.405 --> 48:52.325
Everyone said that
there could never be a treaty

48:52.405 --> 48:56.405
between the three great cities
of Venice, Milan, and Florence.

48:58.125 --> 48:59.245
And yet it is agreed.

49:00.525 --> 49:01.805
[crowd cheering]

49:02.125 --> 49:05.605
I guarantee... I guarantee, gentlemen,

49:06.885 --> 49:10.645
that each will come
to each other's defense if attacked.

49:16.685 --> 49:18.485
[Petrucci] Order! Order!

49:18.565 --> 49:22.765
That's right!
Yes, that's right! Applaud, applaud!

49:22.965 --> 49:26.525
Very good, Lorenzo. Very good.
Another magic trick,

49:26.605 --> 49:27.965
-an illusion.
-[man] Yeah.

49:28.685 --> 49:32.925
Those of us who have been attending
this chamber since before you were born

49:33.005 --> 49:37.845
know an alliance only stands as long as
those who agree to it, uphold it or live.

49:38.645 --> 49:39.685
It secures nothing.

49:40.445 --> 49:42.725
Now, let us proceed with the election.

49:43.045 --> 49:44.565
[indistinct chatter]

49:48.525 --> 49:49.605
Gentlemen...

49:50.645 --> 49:52.805
Signor Pazzi was right.

49:53.085 --> 49:58.485
We have not adequately considered
the death of our friend Luca Soderini.

50:02.325 --> 50:03.645
I propose...

50:05.685 --> 50:08.045
to postpone the vote out of respect.

50:09.245 --> 50:12.125
Yes, because he knows he'll lose.

50:12.885 --> 50:15.485
-[bell ringing]
-[Lorenzo] No!

50:16.885 --> 50:18.605
We must not postpone the vote.

50:21.485 --> 50:22.645
Gentlemen,

50:22.845 --> 50:26.365
Luca Soderini was a dear,
dear friend of mine.

50:26.605 --> 50:30.405
And I can think of no better tribute
than to offer his seat to his son...

50:31.885 --> 50:32.925
Bastiano.

50:37.285 --> 50:40.285
I know what it means
to lose a father too soon.

50:41.125 --> 50:43.005
And to have to assume
greater responsibility,

50:43.085 --> 50:44.405
but I will ask you to do so.

51:02.685 --> 51:03.525
I will be honored.

51:10.965 --> 51:12.485
You know who killed your father, boy?

51:14.525 --> 51:15.525
I do not know.

51:17.165 --> 51:19.205
But I do not believe it was Lorenzo.

51:21.325 --> 51:22.405
I support Petrucci.

51:22.685 --> 51:24.685
-[crowd cheering]
-[man] Yes!

51:24.765 --> 51:26.485
[man] Well said, Bastiano!

51:34.285 --> 51:36.205
Let the voting begin!

52:01.485 --> 52:03.365
-You've done it.
-[bell clanging]

52:12.885 --> 52:14.045
Have you seen Giuliano?

52:15.885 --> 52:17.525
-[Salviati] Where is Jacopo?
-Come.

52:19.765 --> 52:22.365
This alliance with Milan and Venice...

52:23.765 --> 52:24.645
will not hold.

52:26.205 --> 52:27.485
How can you be sure of it?

52:29.285 --> 52:30.965
We've already set in motion

52:31.405 --> 52:32.845
precautionary measures.

52:37.645 --> 52:39.245
We underestimated him.

52:39.805 --> 52:42.125
If Lorenzo can bring Milan
and Venice together,

52:42.565 --> 52:44.485
what other miracles is he capable of?
[Giuliano sobbing]

52:58.685 --> 52:59.485
[Salviati]<i> And Lorenzo?</i>

53:00.885 --> 53:02.925
[Francesco] He's too wily to be outwitted.

53:03.965 --> 53:05.285
[Jacopo] You must go to Rome.

53:06.285 --> 53:08.125
The time for politics is over.

53:23.805 --> 53:24.725
Traitor.

53:25.845 --> 53:26.965
No!

54:05.205 --> 54:07.485
Papa!

54:27.005 --> 54:29.565
Medici blood must be spilled.
