WEBVTT

00:00.135 --> 00:01.629
What are you hiding about Cuba?

00:01.672 --> 00:02.996
Nothing.

00:03.039 --> 00:04.789
Previously on
"The Enemy Within"...

00:04.833 --> 00:06.967
The past six months,
the CIA started sending

00:07.010 --> 00:08.889
Tal prisoners to a black site
detention center.

00:08.932 --> 00:10.383
Sierra Maestra.

00:10.426 --> 00:12.305
Tal values Mendoza.

00:12.347 --> 00:14.567
I know you're not just one
of Tal's operatives.

00:14.610 --> 00:16.062
You're in a relationship
with him.

00:16.105 --> 00:18.240
- You know nothing about me.
- She's vulnerable.

00:18.283 --> 00:19.564
I think we can turn her.

00:19.606 --> 00:20.901
I was hoping I could see my mom.

00:20.930 --> 00:22.979
How is your dad?
Does he know that you're here?

00:23.022 --> 00:24.132
No.

00:24.175 --> 00:25.584
If Chris finds out

00:25.627 --> 00:27.269
that I'm meeting Hannah,
he'll put an end to it.

00:27.292 --> 00:30.367
I spent the last three years
barely surviving without her,

00:30.409 --> 00:32.886
so I'll do anything.

00:34.508 --> 00:36.857
Tal, you made me an offer.

00:36.899 --> 00:39.462
Feed me intelligence.
Protect me from your country.

00:39.504 --> 00:41.938
In return, your daughter
will be safe forever.

00:41.981 --> 00:44.159
Agent Keaton...
He's closing in on you.

00:44.202 --> 00:45.502
I know you feel it.
I can help you.

00:45.525 --> 00:46.764
Why would you do this now?

00:46.806 --> 00:52.015
I am not going to die in a cage.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:15.927 --> 01:18.404
No, no,
that's not gonna work for us.

01:18.447 --> 01:20.112
Dan's asking
if operations have seen

01:20.155 --> 01:21.991
that vulnerability report.
Not yet.

01:22.034 --> 01:23.742
I was planning to loop
them in later today.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.450
Because Langley needs
their system

01:25.492 --> 01:26.816
back up and running this week.

01:26.859 --> 01:29.634
- Something to drink, ma'am?
- Coffee, black.

01:29.677 --> 01:31.214
Then when can you have it?

01:34.843 --> 01:38.217
- How we looking?
- Fuel levels are good.

01:38.259 --> 01:40.523
Hydraulic fluid's good.
All set.

01:40.565 --> 01:43.128
Tower, this is Gulfstream
Four Tango Alpha,

01:43.170 --> 01:45.092
ready for takeoff on runway 2-1.

01:45.134 --> 01:48.550
Four Tango Alpha, you're
clear for takeoff runway 2-1.

01:48.593 --> 01:51.027
Copy. Cleared for takeoff
runway 2-1,

01:51.070 --> 01:52.991
Gulfstream Four Tango Alpha.

01:53.034 --> 01:54.485
Thank you, tower.

01:57.816 --> 01:59.695
Carla Mendoza said anything yet?

01:59.738 --> 02:00.848
Not yet.

02:00.891 --> 02:02.513
We only apprehended her
48 hours ago.

02:02.556 --> 02:04.990
Daniel spent most of that time
trying to get her to talk.

02:05.032 --> 02:07.595
She wasn't just
a lieutenant of Tal's.

02:07.637 --> 02:08.875
She was a confidant.

02:08.918 --> 02:10.473
So my guess is she'll be loyal
till the end.

02:10.497 --> 02:12.291
We'll see about that.

02:12.334 --> 02:14.555
My experience,
loyalty only goes so far.

02:14.597 --> 02:18.184
I keep thinking about what we
learned about Tal from Langley.

02:18.226 --> 02:20.916
He's planning something
at that CIA black site.

02:20.960 --> 02:23.436
He knows Sierra Maestra
has a detention center

02:23.479 --> 02:25.358
with his operatives.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.980
Got to figure
out what his endgame is

02:27.023 --> 02:28.346
before it's too late.

02:28.390 --> 02:30.439
You mean weneed
to figure it out.

02:30.481 --> 02:31.696
Whether I like it
or not, Shepherd,

02:31.719 --> 02:33.769
you and I are in this together.

02:39.875 --> 02:41.669
Thank you for this, by the way.

02:41.711 --> 02:45.341
I'd forgotten the simple
pleasure of just being outside.

02:45.383 --> 02:47.476
No need to thank me.
You've earned it.

02:47.518 --> 02:50.209
Haven't always made it easy,
but you've helped me get closer

02:50.252 --> 02:52.216
to catching Tal than
I have been in three years.

02:52.258 --> 02:55.034
I need to catch him
as badly as you do.

02:55.077 --> 02:57.980
- Will.
- What's up?

02:58.023 --> 02:59.944
Earlier this morning,
a private plane took off

02:59.987 --> 03:01.908
from Butler, Pennsylvania,
headed for Miami.

03:01.952 --> 03:04.020
Two hours into the flight,
all communications went dark.

03:04.043 --> 03:05.196
Hijacking?

03:05.239 --> 03:06.668
We don't know,
but the plane just landed

03:06.691 --> 03:08.313
at an unmanned airfield
16 miles away,

03:08.356 --> 03:09.765
near Fairfax, Virginia.

03:09.808 --> 03:11.620
Deputy Director just called.
He wants us down there.

03:11.644 --> 03:13.437
We got to go.
What'd he have to say?

03:13.481 --> 03:15.079
Well, the company that
chartered the plane

03:15.102 --> 03:16.512
was Alcon International.

03:16.554 --> 03:18.177
They're a contractor
for the CIA.

03:18.219 --> 03:20.203
The passengers on board make up
the entire operating arm

03:20.227 --> 03:21.423
of the company.

03:21.465 --> 03:22.760
With their connections
to the CIA,

03:22.789 --> 03:24.326
the Deputy Director
thinks this could be

03:24.369 --> 03:25.820
a counterintelligence issue.

03:47.682 --> 03:51.013
- Any contact on the inside?
- No, nothing yet.

03:51.056 --> 03:52.977
How long have
they been grounded?

03:53.021 --> 03:54.643
26 minutes and counting.

03:54.686 --> 03:55.668
Bring everybody in.

03:55.711 --> 03:56.949
All right, circle up, guys.

03:56.991 --> 03:58.249
Everyone got briefed
on the schematics

03:58.273 --> 04:00.108
of this thing, right?
12 seats...

04:09.546 --> 04:10.911
What are you doing here,
Cabrera?

04:10.954 --> 04:12.639
CIA has reason to believe
that highly classified

04:12.663 --> 04:14.584
intelligence of ours
may be on that plane.

04:14.627 --> 04:16.524
We're here to ensure it doesn't
fall into the wrong hands.

04:16.548 --> 04:17.870
You mean our hands.

04:17.914 --> 04:19.257
I'm not here to get
in your way, Agent Keaton.

04:19.281 --> 04:20.690
I just need
to protect our intel.

04:20.732 --> 04:23.466
Your intel?
What about the people inside?

04:23.508 --> 04:25.557
You have your orders.
I have mine.

04:27.607 --> 04:29.273
All right, listen up, everybody.

04:29.315 --> 04:31.085
We have a possible hijacking,
hostage situation,

04:31.109 --> 04:32.773
or act of terrorism.

04:32.817 --> 04:34.587
Flight manifest says there's
nine souls aboard that plane.

04:34.610 --> 04:36.702
They could be hurt and in need
of medical attention.

04:36.745 --> 04:38.026
Bragg?

04:38.069 --> 04:40.118
HRT, you guys take point
on the approach.

04:40.161 --> 04:42.040
Breach the cabin
through the front door.

04:42.082 --> 04:43.981
Then our team's going in,
and we'll assess the situation

04:44.004 --> 04:45.199
from there, all right?
Clear?

04:45.243 --> 04:47.377
- Let's do it.
- Let's move.

05:26.320 --> 05:27.430
My God.

05:29.608 --> 05:30.846
This is Agent Bragg.

05:30.889 --> 05:33.237
We have multiple
fatalities on board.

05:33.280 --> 05:36.610
Looks like everyone's dead.
Not everyone.

05:36.653 --> 05:39.471
The two pilots...
They're missing.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.218
The laptop's in our possession.

05:46.260 --> 05:50.359
We'll upload the CAD files
as soon as we get to the club.

05:50.402 --> 05:53.305
No.
No witnesses.

05:53.349 --> 05:54.630
No survivors.

06:04.422 --> 06:06.429
- It's bright up here.
- Yeah.

06:06.472 --> 06:08.478
Better than
the holding cell, right?

06:08.521 --> 06:11.681
A lot better.
That was nice of Agent Keaton.

06:13.047 --> 06:14.926
You're gonna do great today.

06:14.968 --> 06:16.720
Yeah.

06:16.762 --> 06:18.641
Are you nervous?

06:18.684 --> 06:20.263
A little.

06:20.307 --> 06:21.758
Don't be.
You'll be fine.

06:21.801 --> 06:24.363
I'm nervous
about parallel parking.

06:24.406 --> 06:25.900
Nerves?

06:25.942 --> 06:28.462
Nerves are just
adrenaline surges

06:28.505 --> 06:31.024
reacting to an emotion
that you're having.

06:31.067 --> 06:33.074
So, if you can distract
yourself from that emotion,

06:33.116 --> 06:34.867
then the nerves will go away.

06:34.910 --> 06:36.148
How do I do that?

06:36.191 --> 06:39.692
Um, you could take
your thumbnail

06:39.735 --> 06:41.443
and squeeze it like this.

06:44.602 --> 06:46.139
Harder.
It hurts.

06:46.183 --> 06:47.762
Well, that's the point, right?

06:47.805 --> 06:49.599
You're thinking about the pain

06:49.641 --> 06:51.221
and not about the driver's test.

06:51.264 --> 06:52.417
I guess.

06:52.459 --> 06:53.674
You have to separate
your emotions

06:53.698 --> 06:54.808
from what you have to do,

06:54.851 --> 06:57.754
or your emotions
will sabotage you.

06:57.797 --> 06:59.505
Did you learn that in the CIA?

07:02.238 --> 07:03.476
You're gonna do really well.

07:03.519 --> 07:05.611
And when you get your license,
you're gonna be

07:05.654 --> 07:08.216
a very careful driver.
I promise.

07:08.259 --> 07:10.521
Wear your seat belt.
No texting, never.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.529
Dad already talked
to me about it.

07:12.571 --> 07:13.980
Good.

07:15.987 --> 07:18.933
How is he?

07:18.975 --> 07:21.068
He's okay.

07:21.111 --> 07:24.058
I feel bad sometimes, though.
- Why?

07:24.100 --> 07:28.028
Just, you know,
for not telling the truth

07:28.071 --> 07:29.950
about where I am
when I come see you.

07:33.622 --> 07:37.635
When I get my license,
I can visit you more often.

07:37.678 --> 07:39.472
I would love that.

07:41.735 --> 07:43.400
If I could drive you someplace,

07:43.442 --> 07:44.724
where would you want to go?

07:46.688 --> 07:48.225
I don't...

07:48.268 --> 07:50.616
The beach, the woods?

07:50.660 --> 07:53.093
Um...
anywhere...

07:53.136 --> 07:54.759
as long as I was with you.

07:59.498 --> 08:02.743
Maybe one day I could
drive you out of here.

08:02.786 --> 08:04.409
Help you escape.

08:04.451 --> 08:06.715
I could be your getaway driver.

08:08.806 --> 08:10.856
I really think
that my getaway driver's

08:10.899 --> 08:13.888
gonna have to be
a confident parallel parker.

08:17.474 --> 08:19.780
My team looked
into Alcon International.

08:19.823 --> 08:22.044
We know that they're
a private defense contractor.

08:22.087 --> 08:23.880
We also know
that they specialize

08:23.922 --> 08:25.587
in security and communications.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.466
But what we don't know

08:27.509 --> 08:31.053
is what work they're doing
for the CIA.

08:31.096 --> 08:32.719
I can't answer that.

08:32.760 --> 08:33.999
Seven people are dead,

08:34.043 --> 08:35.664
and that's the game
you're gonna play?

08:35.707 --> 08:36.818
Look, it's not my choice

08:36.860 --> 08:38.331
to leave you
in the dark, Agent Keaton.

08:38.355 --> 08:41.344
Then whose is it?
And I'll go talk to them.

08:41.385 --> 08:42.453
I'm sorry.

08:45.102 --> 08:47.707
Yeah, all right.

08:47.749 --> 08:50.012
All right, bye.

08:54.965 --> 08:57.698
- Cabrera give you anything?
- Negative.

08:57.740 --> 09:00.066
I thought the CIA and the FBI
were playing nice after 9/11.

09:00.089 --> 09:01.584
Yeah, tell me about it.

09:01.627 --> 09:03.889
Cabrera was on site
to protect classified intel,

09:03.932 --> 09:05.830
which makes me think that those
executives were killed

09:05.853 --> 09:08.075
because of something they had
with them on that plane.

09:08.117 --> 09:10.186
Let me call the departure
airport and see if they have

09:10.209 --> 09:12.045
a log of everything
that was on board.

09:12.088 --> 09:13.795
Will.

09:13.839 --> 09:14.821
I think I have something.

09:14.863 --> 09:16.102
Tom Humphrey, Alberto Diaz...

09:16.144 --> 09:17.382
They were the scheduled pilots

09:17.426 --> 09:18.834
for the Alcon flight
this morning.

09:18.878 --> 09:20.116
- Where are they now?
- Dead.

09:20.158 --> 09:21.525
Local PD found them both shot.

09:21.567 --> 09:23.404
And both men's flight
credentials were stolen.

09:23.446 --> 09:25.112
Somebody else was
flying that plane.

09:25.154 --> 09:27.223
Whoever it was had to have
left that airport somehow.

09:27.247 --> 09:28.973
Get a list of every vehicle
that entered and exited

09:28.997 --> 09:30.663
that property
in the last 24 hours.

09:30.705 --> 09:32.981
And see if Kate can get any
type of security-camera footage

09:33.011 --> 09:34.695
from the surrounding area.
Did you hear back from the FAA?

09:34.719 --> 09:37.068
Not yet, but we should have
the voice of the actual pilots

09:37.110 --> 09:39.032
on tape by the end of the day.
Keep me posted.

09:41.337 --> 09:42.832
Highly organized execution

09:42.875 --> 09:45.522
carried out by trained
assassins posing as pilots?

09:45.565 --> 09:47.315
You ever seen anything
like this before?

09:47.358 --> 09:49.792
Yeah. Once.

09:54.319 --> 09:56.026
Keaton.

09:58.332 --> 09:59.783
What's up, Jacquie?

09:59.826 --> 10:01.468
The plane's final flight
manifest lists two pilots,

10:01.491 --> 10:02.920
a flight attendant,
and six passengers.

10:02.944 --> 10:05.505
But the original manifest
lists seven passengers.

10:05.548 --> 10:07.598
It was changed
at the last minute.

10:07.640 --> 10:10.416
Someone else was supposed
to be on that plane.

10:11.825 --> 10:13.277
Her name is Kathy Hong.

10:13.320 --> 10:15.284
She's a former engineering
professor at MIT

10:15.326 --> 10:17.760
who now does consulting work
for government contractors.

10:17.803 --> 10:20.536
She's currently working
with Alcon International.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.030
What work does she do for them?

10:22.073 --> 10:23.952
Well, neither Alcon
nor the CIA would tell us.

10:23.994 --> 10:26.044
What we know is that Hong
specializes

10:26.087 --> 10:28.863
in large-format
self-sustaining systems.

10:28.905 --> 10:31.339
Huge buildings and complexes
that run solely

10:31.381 --> 10:32.577
on renewable energy.

10:32.620 --> 10:34.627
- Where is she now?
- We don't know.

10:34.670 --> 10:36.036
I think that she's on the run.

10:36.079 --> 10:37.702
In the last 24 hours,
she cleared out all

10:37.744 --> 10:39.323
of her personal bank accounts.

10:39.366 --> 10:41.843
So she skips a flight and now
she's liquidating her assets?

10:41.886 --> 10:43.509
She's either involved
in the murder,

10:43.551 --> 10:45.430
or she knows that whoever
killed her colleagues

10:45.473 --> 10:47.394
is coming after her next.

10:47.437 --> 10:49.017
I want her found now.

10:49.059 --> 10:50.040
Okay.

10:54.397 --> 10:56.147
I go after Hong,
I want you with me.

10:56.191 --> 10:57.343
Why?

10:57.386 --> 10:59.094
She's a contractor with the CIA.

10:59.137 --> 11:00.844
I go and arrest her,
Cabrera's gonna have

11:00.887 --> 11:02.143
his agency's lawyers
in my office

11:02.169 --> 11:03.663
before I get
the cuffs off of her.

11:03.705 --> 11:05.798
I want to know what Alcon
is doing for the CIA.

11:05.840 --> 11:09.085
I want to know why those seven
people were shot and killed on that plane,

11:09.129 --> 11:11.520
and I want to find the men
who did it.

11:16.161 --> 11:18.083
I found her.

11:18.125 --> 11:20.109
Our tracking software
places Kathy Hong's cell phone

11:20.132 --> 11:22.608
at 645 West 24th Street
in Manhattan.

11:22.651 --> 11:26.494
It looks like the address
for an art auction house.

11:43.019 --> 11:44.812
Odd choice to come
to an art auction

11:44.855 --> 11:46.947
after six of your coworkers
have been murdered.

11:46.990 --> 11:48.613
You think she's meeting
someone here?

11:48.655 --> 11:50.639
Well, it's either that,
or she's selling off assets.

11:50.662 --> 11:52.541
Hong closed all
her bank accounts yesterday.

11:52.583 --> 11:55.444
I almost didn't recognize you.

11:55.488 --> 11:57.109
That's kind of the point.

11:57.153 --> 11:58.282
All right, when we get inside,

11:58.305 --> 11:59.714
don't just focus
on finding Hong.

11:59.757 --> 12:01.508
Take in the room.
Take in the patrons.

12:01.551 --> 12:03.686
This is a new environment
for us. We're on our own.

12:03.728 --> 12:05.071
Bragg, why don't you
case the exits,

12:05.095 --> 12:06.139
make sure she doesn't
try to flee?

12:06.162 --> 12:07.315
Yeah, you got it.

12:10.987 --> 12:13.080
Is there gonna be
a problem here?

12:13.122 --> 12:15.086
I don't know.

12:15.130 --> 12:17.392
But we're in it together, right?

12:17.435 --> 12:19.868
We will start the bidding
with this unique piece

12:19.912 --> 12:22.473
at $22,250.

12:22.516 --> 12:24.779
22,250 here.
Looking for 25,000.

12:24.822 --> 12:26.402
25,000 in the back.
I have 30,000.

12:26.445 --> 12:28.238
I have 35,000 right here
on the phone line.

12:28.280 --> 12:29.818
- Here you are, sir.
- Thank you.

12:29.861 --> 12:31.483
I have 40,000 here.

12:31.526 --> 12:34.344
45,000, looking at $50,000,
$60,000, $70,000.

12:34.387 --> 12:37.546
I have $70,000 on the floor...
I don't see her.

12:37.589 --> 12:39.682
Why don't I take the north
side, you take the south?

12:39.724 --> 12:41.561
No. No, that's not how
it's gonna work.

12:41.603 --> 12:43.439
$85,000.

12:43.482 --> 12:47.026
Bragg, Pettigrew,
you guys see anything?

12:47.069 --> 12:48.563
Nothing over here.

12:48.606 --> 12:49.545
Keaton, I'm by the north exit.

12:49.588 --> 12:51.125
Nothing here either.

12:51.168 --> 12:53.815
From the young lady over
here, we have $100,000.

12:53.858 --> 12:55.608
The gentleman there in the back,

12:55.652 --> 12:57.507
we got the phone lines
at 105,000. 110,000 right here.

12:57.530 --> 13:00.690
$110,000 on the floor.
110,000, sold!

13:00.733 --> 13:05.302
Congratulations.

13:07.138 --> 13:08.590
There she is.

13:08.632 --> 13:10.852
Looks like she's selling off
her assets to go on the run.

13:10.895 --> 13:13.159
It doesn't mean she's not
gonna be meeting someone else.

13:13.201 --> 13:15.763
Got eyes on Hong.
She's at the auction floor...

13:15.806 --> 13:18.197
The sellers' table.

13:23.193 --> 13:25.669
Do you see those
two men with her?

13:28.488 --> 13:30.409
She has two bodyguards with her.

13:30.452 --> 13:32.160
Dark jackets.

13:34.166 --> 13:36.344
Got 'em.

13:36.387 --> 13:37.454
Me too.

13:37.497 --> 13:39.077
What are we doing, Keaton?

13:39.120 --> 13:41.126
Hold your positions.

13:42.408 --> 13:44.799
She's making a move.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.925
And you're sold!

14:03.885 --> 14:07.045
Looks like she's going
into the bathroom.

14:07.089 --> 14:09.351
- I'll go.
- No, no, wait. No, wait.

14:09.394 --> 14:11.444
This is our chance.
We might not get another one.

14:11.486 --> 14:12.958
Pettigrew, I need you
over here right now.

14:12.981 --> 14:14.134
On my way.

14:14.176 --> 14:15.756
I'm gonna send Pettigrew
in with you.

14:15.799 --> 14:17.696
I'm not gonna be able to get
information out of Hong

14:17.720 --> 14:18.959
with a chaperone there.

14:19.001 --> 14:20.795
She won't be
in there long, Keaton.

14:22.759 --> 14:24.509
All right, go ahead and do it.

14:30.530 --> 14:32.538
Are there any earlier flights?

14:32.580 --> 14:34.032
You're sure?

14:39.455 --> 14:40.437
I'll call you right back.

14:43.597 --> 14:45.219
Take the SIM card
out of your cell phone

14:45.262 --> 14:46.477
and flush it down
the toilet now.

14:46.500 --> 14:48.038
- Excuse me?
- You heard what I said.

14:48.080 --> 14:50.386
Do it now.

14:50.428 --> 14:51.881
- Who are you?
- I'm Emma Clarke.

14:51.923 --> 14:54.186
I'm a security liaison
for Alcon International.

14:54.229 --> 14:55.980
Six of your colleagues
were murdered today.

14:56.022 --> 14:57.792
We have reason to believe
that your life is in danger.

14:57.815 --> 14:59.865
Take the SIM card
out of your cell phone

14:59.908 --> 15:01.573
and flush it down the toilet.

15:01.616 --> 15:04.861
If I can track you by using it,
they can, too.

15:17.159 --> 15:18.183
Good.

15:18.226 --> 15:21.087
Is there somewhere else
we can talk?

15:21.130 --> 15:23.008
I think so, yes.

15:23.052 --> 15:26.296
The antiquities room.
- Lead the way.

15:28.816 --> 15:30.543
I know you're scared and you
don't know who to trust,

15:30.567 --> 15:31.739
and I'm sorry I don't
have time to walk you

15:31.762 --> 15:32.787
through this right now.

15:32.830 --> 15:34.239
If you want my help, lead on.

15:34.281 --> 15:35.904
If not, good luck on your own.

15:37.740 --> 15:40.088
Just tell me
I can talk to Ahman.

15:40.131 --> 15:42.822
He's my contact at Alcon.

15:42.864 --> 15:46.665
Get us out of here,
and I'll call him myself.

15:46.707 --> 15:47.817
Okay.

15:56.742 --> 15:59.133
Shepherd and Hong
are exiting the bathroom.

16:11.217 --> 16:13.138
What's our plan here?

16:13.181 --> 16:14.632
Hang back, or she'll see us.

16:14.676 --> 16:16.896
But do not take your eyes
off of her or Shepherd.

16:23.301 --> 16:25.327
They're walking towards
the west side of the building.

16:25.350 --> 16:27.614
Need a vantage point
inside that room.

16:27.657 --> 16:28.638
I got them.

16:35.300 --> 16:37.947
Why were six executives killed?

16:37.990 --> 16:39.356
Not here.

16:44.352 --> 16:45.377
This way.

16:51.098 --> 16:52.037
Bragg, do you have them
in sight?

16:52.081 --> 16:53.489
No, I just lost them.

16:53.533 --> 16:55.497
Wait there.
I'm headed your way.

16:57.120 --> 16:59.041
I think Hong's guard's
slipping out the back.

17:02.030 --> 17:03.695
That's it.
I'm going in after them.

17:12.534 --> 17:14.327
Shepherd and Hong are gone.

17:14.369 --> 17:16.224
There's an exit on the north
side of the building.

17:16.248 --> 17:18.041
Get outside now.

17:33.543 --> 17:35.378
Anything?
No, nothing.

17:35.421 --> 17:37.257
I don't have them.

17:51.476 --> 17:53.653
Who are you?
What do you want from me?

17:53.697 --> 17:54.978
I'm with Alcon Securities.

17:55.020 --> 17:57.796
No, there is no one
at Alcon named Ahman.

17:57.838 --> 18:00.187
You're lying to me.
Now answer the question.

18:00.230 --> 18:01.681
Who are you?

18:04.872 --> 18:06.409
They couldn't have gone too far.

18:06.451 --> 18:08.416
You guys split up
and keep at it.

18:11.704 --> 18:15.290
Kate, I need you to run a trace
on Shepherd's GPS transmitter.

18:15.333 --> 18:16.700
On it.

18:16.742 --> 18:20.841
Answer the question.
Who are you?

18:20.885 --> 18:22.678
I'm Erica Shepherd.

18:25.710 --> 18:27.589
You're supposed to be in prison.

18:27.631 --> 18:29.315
I'm cooperating with the FBI.
They're here with me.

18:29.339 --> 18:31.303
You should put the gun down.
Keep it on her.

18:31.346 --> 18:32.797
Someone just killed
every passenger

18:32.840 --> 18:34.249
on a plane
I was supposed to be on.

18:34.293 --> 18:36.171
I am not trusting anyone,
especially not you.

18:36.214 --> 18:38.027
- Who killed those executives?
- I have no idea.

18:38.050 --> 18:39.392
You were supposed
to be on that plane.

18:39.416 --> 18:41.594
Something scared you.
What was it?

18:49.280 --> 18:50.774
I'm on 27th and 9th.

18:50.817 --> 18:53.421
I just heard some gunshots
on the northeast corner.

18:53.465 --> 18:55.300
Let me ask you this again.

18:55.343 --> 18:57.308
Why weren't you on that plane?

18:57.350 --> 18:59.290
I came home last night.
Someone ransacked my apartment.

19:00.164 --> 19:02.854
- What were they looking for?
- A laptop, I think.

19:02.897 --> 19:04.135
What was on it?
Your work?

19:04.178 --> 19:05.203
Yes.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.826
Designs for a sustainable
dormitory.

19:06.868 --> 19:08.191
- Where?
- I don't know.

19:08.235 --> 19:09.687
That information was silo'd off.

19:09.729 --> 19:11.072
It wasn't at your apartment,
was it?

19:11.096 --> 19:13.700
No. It was on the plane
with the executives.

19:13.743 --> 19:15.066
You listen to me carefully.

19:15.109 --> 19:16.538
The people that
are looking for you...

19:16.561 --> 19:18.056
They don't like loose ends.

19:18.098 --> 19:19.825
They are gonna come after you
until you are dead.

19:19.849 --> 19:21.429
- Drop the gun!
- Okay.

19:21.472 --> 19:23.521
- Now!
- Okay, I'm putting it down.

19:23.564 --> 19:25.912
Don't move!

19:25.955 --> 19:28.815
Put the gun down right now.
Put it down.

19:30.994 --> 19:31.976
Back up.

19:32.019 --> 19:33.428
Go.

19:33.470 --> 19:35.776
I got Shepherd and Hong
in the alley off of 8th Ave.

19:35.819 --> 19:36.844
Send the cars in.

19:46.524 --> 19:48.233
Agents from the New York Bureau,

19:48.276 --> 19:49.685
they're questioning Hong.

19:49.728 --> 19:52.972
But I think she told us
everything she knows.

19:53.016 --> 19:55.492
How could the designs
for a sustainable dormitory

19:55.535 --> 19:58.438
be worth the lives
of seven innocent people?

19:58.481 --> 20:00.573
They wouldn't.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.837
Unless...

20:02.879 --> 20:05.612
the dorm was actually
a CIA black site.

20:08.515 --> 20:12.358
Alcon was under contract
with the CIA.

20:12.401 --> 20:13.938
I bet you they were hired
to build

20:13.981 --> 20:15.987
a secret detention center
at Sierra Maestra.

20:16.031 --> 20:17.995
That makes sense.
That puts Tal behind it.

20:18.038 --> 20:20.258
He should have just pulled
the trigger himself.

20:20.300 --> 20:21.558
And that jet
that Laine was on...

20:21.582 --> 20:22.777
It crashed into the mountain.

20:22.820 --> 20:24.229
Everybody on board was killed,

20:24.272 --> 20:25.638
including those Tal operatives.

20:25.681 --> 20:26.919
I knew there were similarities,

20:26.962 --> 20:29.182
but I didn't think
they were connected.

20:31.108 --> 20:33.200
Well, now we know
why they were killed.

20:33.243 --> 20:34.695
We know Tal was behind it.

20:34.737 --> 20:36.659
We just have to find
the man who did it.

20:45.625 --> 20:47.589
The air traffic control
recording came in.

20:47.633 --> 20:48.914
We have the assassin's voice.

20:54.817 --> 20:57.208
Tower, this is Gulfstream
Four Tango Alpha,

20:57.250 --> 20:59.300
ready for takeoff on runway 2-1.

20:59.343 --> 21:01.093
You can turn it...

21:01.136 --> 21:03.248
Four Tango Alpha, you're
clear for takeoff, runway 2-1.

21:03.271 --> 21:05.620
Copy. Cleared for takeoff,
runway 2-1,

21:05.662 --> 21:07.199
Gulfstream Four Tango Alpha.

21:07.242 --> 21:08.608
Thank you, tower.

21:11.769 --> 21:13.604
What is it?

21:32.264 --> 21:34.484
Play this one.

21:41.402 --> 21:43.665
Tower, this is Falcon Kilo
Papa Niner,

21:43.708 --> 21:46.825
ready for takeoff, runway 0-4.

21:46.868 --> 21:48.747
Kilo Papa Niner,
you're clear for takeoff,

21:48.789 --> 21:50.241
runway 0-4.

21:50.283 --> 21:52.333
Cleared for takeoff runway 0-4,

21:52.376 --> 21:54.639
Falcon Kilo Papa Niner.

21:54.682 --> 21:55.707
Thank you, tower.

21:55.749 --> 21:57.073
That's the recording

21:57.116 --> 21:59.336
from the flight
that Laine was on, isn't it?

21:59.378 --> 22:00.959
Play the new one again.

22:03.596 --> 22:05.901
Tower, this is Gulfstream
Four Tango Alpha,

22:05.943 --> 22:09.360
ready for takeoff on runway 2-1.

22:09.403 --> 22:11.110
The old one.

22:11.153 --> 22:13.159
Tower, this is
Falcon Kilo Papa Niner,

22:13.203 --> 22:16.020
ready for takeoff, runway 0-4.

22:16.064 --> 22:18.242
Same tone.
Same cadence.

22:18.284 --> 22:20.077
Those aren't
two different pilots.

22:20.119 --> 22:22.639
The man that shot seven people
yesterday is the same man

22:22.682 --> 22:25.970
that murdered a flight full of
CIA operatives three years ago.

22:29.684 --> 22:32.119
Laine's killer's still alive.

22:42.751 --> 22:44.160
This makes no sense.

22:44.203 --> 22:46.935
Laine's killer was on
the plane when it crashed.

22:47.808 --> 22:49.985
No one survived.
- Yeah, well, he did.

22:50.028 --> 22:51.693
Somehow, someway,
he got off that plane.

22:51.736 --> 22:53.913
He had to have parachuted
before impact.

22:53.956 --> 22:55.151
That's the only explanation.

22:55.194 --> 22:57.415
All this time.

22:57.458 --> 22:58.885
All this time he's been
walking around the streets.

22:58.909 --> 23:01.472
Don't do that. There's no way
you could've known.

23:01.514 --> 23:03.179
No, I should've known.
I want witnesses.

23:03.222 --> 23:04.716
I want the biometrics.

23:04.759 --> 23:06.894
I want a physical description
from yesterday's attack.

23:06.936 --> 23:08.559
I need to know who he is.

23:10.140 --> 23:12.104
I can give you his name.

23:14.836 --> 23:16.416
What?

23:16.459 --> 23:17.996
After Laine's death,

23:18.039 --> 23:20.003
the CIA was running
their own investigation on Tal.

23:20.046 --> 23:21.711
Her killer's name
was caught on chatter

23:21.753 --> 23:22.949
between associates of his.

23:22.992 --> 23:24.913
I never mentioned it
because the name alone

23:24.957 --> 23:27.048
never led anywhere
and he was presumed dead.

23:27.091 --> 23:29.568
- What's his name?
- Alexander Chigorin.

23:33.411 --> 23:35.760
Anna Cruz said that name
to me before she died.

23:35.802 --> 23:38.363
I asked you about it.
You lied to my face.

23:38.407 --> 23:41.139
I believe Anna Cruz gave you
that name to hurt you

23:41.182 --> 23:43.232
and to send you on a path
looking for a dead man.

23:43.274 --> 23:45.079
And you didn't want
to do that, now, did you?

23:45.111 --> 23:47.459
No, I wanted you
to focus on Tal!

23:52.412 --> 23:55.529
Kate, escort Shepherd
back to her holding cell.

23:55.572 --> 23:57.109
Of course.

24:06.546 --> 24:07.826
He's alive.

24:07.870 --> 24:09.705
He's still alive,
and he's killing people.

24:09.748 --> 24:11.072
I'm sorry, Will.

24:11.115 --> 24:12.372
I can't imagine what
you must be going through.

24:12.395 --> 24:14.018
Yeah, well, I need to find him.

24:14.061 --> 24:16.623
We will.
We will.

24:16.665 --> 24:18.246
You know, I've, uh...

24:18.288 --> 24:20.423
I've never liked the idea
of working with Shepherd,

24:20.466 --> 24:23.028
but this is Laine's killer
we're talking about.

24:23.071 --> 24:27.212
You sure you don't want to use
her to help us find Chigorin?

24:27.255 --> 24:29.860
No. No.

24:31.098 --> 24:32.507
Not this time.

24:32.550 --> 24:34.600
Understood.

24:36.009 --> 24:37.332
Daniel.

24:37.375 --> 24:40.236
Bring up Carla Mendoza.

24:40.279 --> 24:43.097
I want to talk to her.

25:04.930 --> 25:06.296
Alexander Chigorin...

25:06.340 --> 25:08.132
I need to know where
to find him.

25:08.175 --> 25:10.268
I don't know who
you're talking about.

25:10.310 --> 25:12.701
Don't lie to me.
We know he's alive.

25:12.744 --> 25:15.691
I know you both worked
for Tal from the beginning.

25:15.733 --> 25:17.697
Where is he?

25:22.053 --> 25:23.504
Are you gonna answer me?

25:26.109 --> 25:28.244
You're wasting your time.

25:28.287 --> 25:30.123
You can't stop him.

25:30.166 --> 25:31.874
Stop him from what?

25:31.916 --> 25:34.307
He's planning something else,
isn't he?

25:34.351 --> 25:37.339
What is it?
Another attack?

25:41.225 --> 25:43.872
What is he planning, Carla?

25:58.903 --> 26:00.526
You got a visitor.

26:05.137 --> 26:07.187
Send her in.

26:07.230 --> 26:11.030
It's not your daughter.
It's your ex-husband.

26:14.617 --> 26:16.239
Keaton allowed that?

26:18.118 --> 26:21.192
He threatened to come back
with his lawyer.

26:40.962 --> 26:42.841
Uh...

26:42.883 --> 26:45.788
How long did you think
you could get away with this?

26:45.830 --> 26:48.563
- Christopher, listen...
- How long?

26:50.740 --> 26:52.022
She's my daughter.

26:52.064 --> 26:54.028
No, she isn't.

26:54.071 --> 26:56.847
She hasn't been your daughter
for the last three years.

26:56.889 --> 26:58.640
Don't say that.

26:58.682 --> 27:00.690
She said she was seeing
a math tutor.

27:00.732 --> 27:03.508
She lied to me because of you.

27:03.551 --> 27:06.283
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

27:06.326 --> 27:09.358
For the last month, Hannah
has been sneaking out here.

27:09.400 --> 27:12.304
She has to take two buses
and walk half a mile

27:12.346 --> 27:13.328
to get here.

27:13.372 --> 27:15.250
Did you know that?

27:15.293 --> 27:17.385
Sometimes she doesn't come
home until after dark

27:17.428 --> 27:21.356
A 15-year-old girl walking
alone in D.C. at night.

27:21.399 --> 27:25.540
What kind of mother
would let her child do that?

27:27.249 --> 27:29.469
I had to see her.

27:30.879 --> 27:32.800
Well...

27:32.843 --> 27:34.764
I can't let that happen anymore.

27:34.807 --> 27:37.881
Oh, Christopher,
please don't do that.

27:37.924 --> 27:40.571
Please don't punish Hannah
because you hate me.

27:40.614 --> 27:44.585
You think that's why
I'm here... to punish you?

27:44.628 --> 27:48.428
This isn't about you.
This is about my daughter.

27:48.471 --> 27:50.819
When you left,
you destroyed her.

27:50.862 --> 27:52.356
But you don't talk about that.

27:52.399 --> 27:56.029
You don't talk about how
she couldn't eat for days,

27:56.071 --> 27:57.737
how she didn't leave her room,

27:57.779 --> 28:00.019
How she missed so much school,
she had to take summer classes.

28:00.042 --> 28:02.263
Did you know that?

28:02.306 --> 28:03.928
- No.
- No, of course you didn't,

28:03.971 --> 28:05.764
because you
weren't there, Erica.

28:05.806 --> 28:06.874
I was.

28:14.304 --> 28:16.524
Look...

28:16.567 --> 28:18.617
after you left,

28:18.659 --> 28:21.307
it took months
to get my child back.

28:24.723 --> 28:27.968
And I know
you love her. I do.

28:28.011 --> 28:30.957
But I cannot let
you hurt her again.

28:51.923 --> 28:54.058
Will.

28:54.101 --> 28:56.107
I've got something.

28:56.150 --> 28:58.071
Alexander Chigorin's in his 30s.

28:58.115 --> 28:59.736
He's former Chechen
Special Forces.

28:59.780 --> 29:01.488
He was recruited by Tal
as a teenager,

29:01.530 --> 29:05.117
and he's one of Tal's
most senior lieutenants.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.186
I reviewed the security footage
within a five-block radius

29:07.210 --> 29:10.198
of the airfield where
his plane landed.

29:09.423 --> 29:11.686
And I found this.

29:19.244 --> 29:20.525
That's Chigorin.

29:20.568 --> 29:22.703
This was yesterday morning
at 9:07 a.m.

29:22.746 --> 29:24.282
This is a block away
from the airfield

29:24.325 --> 29:26.246
It must have been as soon
as they left the plane.

29:26.290 --> 29:27.699
Where is he?

29:27.742 --> 29:29.193
I pulled
the license plate number

29:29.236 --> 29:31.328
from the footage,
and I'm running a search now.

29:39.014 --> 29:41.406
Chigorin's vehicle
was tracked to this address,

29:41.448 --> 29:42.729
known to law enforcement

29:42.771 --> 29:44.266
as the Underground Russian
Social Club.

29:44.309 --> 29:45.888
The mission is
to extract him alive

29:45.932 --> 29:48.000
and as quickly as possible,
but it's not gonna be easy.

29:48.023 --> 29:49.793
They're gonna be armed
and extremely dangerous.

29:49.817 --> 29:52.080
The longer our presence
can go undetected,

29:52.122 --> 29:53.574
the better.

29:53.618 --> 29:55.368
Let's move.

30:04.918 --> 30:07.009
You said this would take
a few hours.

30:08.761 --> 30:11.579
The CAD files are larger
than I thought.

30:11.622 --> 30:13.799
I have to upload them
one at a time.

30:23.834 --> 30:25.199
Guard.

30:27.121 --> 30:28.416
I need to speak
with Agent Keaton.

30:28.445 --> 30:30.324
- He's not here.
- Okay, Agent Zain.

30:30.367 --> 30:32.008
Anyone in Counterintel.
It's really important.

30:32.032 --> 30:33.868
- They're all out.
- Where?

30:56.670 --> 30:58.505
Prove you want to work for him,

30:58.548 --> 31:00.342
or there will be consequences.

31:00.384 --> 31:02.904
What is it?

31:02.947 --> 31:05.209
It's Shepherd.

31:05.252 --> 31:07.473
I have an urgent
message for Tal.

31:07.515 --> 31:09.479
FBI knows where Chigorin is.

31:09.522 --> 31:11.913
He should get him out.
Warn him now.

31:32.239 --> 31:34.630
Aah!

31:41.035 --> 31:43.084
FBI!

31:43.127 --> 31:45.433
Nobody move!

31:47.653 --> 31:49.532
Don't do it!

31:52.948 --> 31:54.357
Almost done.

32:11.821 --> 32:13.829
- Give me the laptop.
- What?

32:13.871 --> 32:17.073
FBI's coming.
Give me the laptop, now!

32:33.683 --> 32:35.392
FBI! Hands up!
Hands up!

32:35.435 --> 32:37.399
Get down on the ground!
I said get on the ground!

32:37.441 --> 32:39.918
- On the ground!
- Get down, get down!

32:39.961 --> 32:42.224
All clear.

32:48.843 --> 32:50.807
Got him.

34:15.139 --> 34:16.676
Come on, go!

35:08.408 --> 35:09.817
You okay?

35:09.859 --> 35:13.105
He was in my hands.
I let him get away.

35:17.887 --> 35:20.962
Come on.
I want to show you something.

35:21.005 --> 35:22.328
What are these?

35:22.371 --> 35:24.164
Detailed schematics
of the facility

35:24.207 --> 35:26.513
Kathy Hong helped
design for Alcon.

35:26.555 --> 35:29.075
These were on the laptop
Chigorin was carrying.

35:29.118 --> 35:31.893
This building is completely
self-sustained.

35:31.935 --> 35:34.626
There is no need
for external power or water.

35:34.669 --> 35:36.804
Perfect if you want
a location off the grid.

35:36.846 --> 35:38.255
Exactly.

35:38.298 --> 35:41.629
This is Sierra Maestra, Will.
It has to be.

35:41.671 --> 35:43.208
That's why Tal wanted
this laptop.

35:43.251 --> 35:45.300
He was planning something there.

35:46.667 --> 35:47.863
Question is, what?

35:52.645 --> 35:54.139
I miss her.

35:54.182 --> 35:56.317
I miss her every day.

35:56.360 --> 35:57.555
So do I.

35:57.599 --> 35:59.093
When I heard that voice,

35:59.135 --> 36:01.654
it was like I was right
back there the day she died.

36:01.698 --> 36:04.045
I thought it would somehow
feel different

36:04.089 --> 36:06.010
after all these years.

36:06.053 --> 36:08.273
Uh, but it doesn't.

36:08.316 --> 36:09.767
Does it?

36:11.817 --> 36:12.971
No.

36:16.002 --> 36:17.923
Well, I know you don't like
to talk about it,

36:17.967 --> 36:21.254
but if you want to, I'm here.

36:26.079 --> 36:27.873
Maybe some other time.

36:37.181 --> 36:40.512
- Where were you?
- New York.

36:40.555 --> 36:42.134
Chigorin?
Did you get him?

36:42.177 --> 36:43.329
No.

36:45.721 --> 36:47.258
I'm sorry.

36:48.880 --> 36:50.333
I'm sorry for everything.

36:50.376 --> 36:52.444
If there's anything else
that you're keeping from me,

36:52.467 --> 36:54.987
I need to know it now.

36:55.029 --> 36:57.463
No...

36:57.506 --> 37:00.111
I've hurt you enough.

37:02.801 --> 37:05.449
The day that Anna Cruz
was killed,

37:05.491 --> 37:08.693
Tal called me
on her cell phone...

37:08.736 --> 37:11.000
said he knew what Laine said
before she died.

37:12.921 --> 37:15.355
He was just trying
to get into your head.

37:15.397 --> 37:16.379
Maybe.

37:16.422 --> 37:18.301
Maybe he was telling the truth.

37:18.343 --> 37:21.760
Maybe Chigorin told him exactly
what happened on that plane.

37:23.809 --> 37:25.688
But I have to know.

37:28.805 --> 37:33.203
The CIA said
that the black box...

37:33.246 --> 37:36.021
on Laine's plane
was destroyed in the crash?

37:36.064 --> 37:37.431
Yeah.

37:38.711 --> 37:40.078
Why?

37:40.120 --> 37:41.677
Flight recorders
are designed to withstand

37:41.701 --> 37:43.494
the most severe impact.

37:43.537 --> 37:45.288
And I know
from first-hand experience

37:45.330 --> 37:49.472
that the CIA has lied
about black boxes before.

37:53.528 --> 37:55.280
Does it exist?

37:55.322 --> 37:56.774
Agent Keaton, it's late.

37:56.816 --> 37:59.250
I really don't want to argue
about a black box

37:59.293 --> 38:00.873
that was destroyed
three years ago.

38:00.915 --> 38:02.410
Does it exist?

38:02.452 --> 38:04.716
I need to hear it, and I need
to hear it right now.

38:04.758 --> 38:06.680
Or I'm launching a public
investigation as to why

38:06.722 --> 38:11.377
Tal operatives are being held
in a CIA black site in Cuba.

38:12.658 --> 38:14.152
I need to hear it.

38:22.521 --> 38:24.614
It's all set up.

38:24.657 --> 38:26.407
Just press "play."

38:45.238 --> 38:47.970
Traffic, this is
Falcon Kilo Papa Niner

38:48.014 --> 38:51.387
leveling off at cruising
altitude, 32,000 feet.

38:51.430 --> 38:53.394
Roger that, aviation.

38:53.436 --> 38:55.187
Falcon Kilo Papa Niner.

38:55.230 --> 38:58.817
No! No!

39:40.833 --> 39:43.267
Terrain ahead.
Pull up.

39:43.310 --> 39:46.427
Terrain ahead.
Pull up.

39:46.469 --> 39:48.604
Terrain ahead.
Pull up.

39:48.648 --> 39:51.508
Terrain ahead.
Pull up.

39:51.551 --> 39:54.028
Pull up. Pull up.

40:33.397 --> 40:34.550
Tal.

40:39.503 --> 40:41.979
It's good to see you, my friend.

40:42.022 --> 40:44.371
You're hurt?

40:44.413 --> 40:45.865
Nothing serious.

40:45.907 --> 40:47.958
Good, good.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.281
I need you healthy.

40:49.324 --> 40:51.331
We have so much work
still to do.

40:53.039 --> 40:54.875
Thank you...

40:54.918 --> 40:56.882
for warning me about the FBI.

40:56.924 --> 40:59.444
That wasn't me.
It was Shepherd.

41:02.561 --> 41:04.098
You're surprised?

41:06.319 --> 41:07.941
She's not who I thought she was.

41:07.984 --> 41:10.888
No one ever is.

41:10.930 --> 41:12.852
I believe...

41:12.894 --> 41:14.901
it is time to bring her in.
