WEBVTT

00:08.389 --> 00:10.225
All right, class,
before you clean up

00:10.226 --> 00:11.880
I have an announcement to make.

00:12.896 --> 00:14.283
What does this say to you?

00:14.284 --> 00:17.114
You got drafted by the Vikings.

00:18.141 --> 00:19.485
Funny.

00:19.486 --> 00:20.629
Cute.

00:20.630 --> 00:21.846
Quiet!

00:22.811 --> 00:25.137
Now, although I teach science

00:25.138 --> 00:27.896
my first love has always
been opera.

00:27.897 --> 00:29.231
What do they have in common?

00:29.232 --> 00:30.145
Nothing.

00:30.146 --> 00:31.506
And that's why I'm bitter.

00:32.566 --> 00:37.224
Which brings us to the annual
Festival of the Classical Arts.

00:37.225 --> 00:38.108
Here it comes.

00:38.109 --> 00:39.827
Who wants to sign up?

00:42.065 --> 00:43.735
You get a beautiful trophy.

00:45.868 --> 00:49.198
And a $100 gift certificate
donated by the Bayside Mall.

00:52.331 --> 00:53.174
Hey, Rae, what do you think?

00:53.175 --> 00:53.983
Should we sign up?

00:53.984 --> 00:56.438
You getting any psychic vibes?

01:00.606 --> 01:01.711
No, I got nothing.

01:02.427 --> 01:03.931
But I do have an idea.

01:03.932 --> 01:05.963
We are going
to do an opera.

01:05.964 --> 01:07.365
An opera?

01:07.366 --> 01:10.094
Rae, come on, we don't
know anything about opera.

01:10.095 --> 01:10.721
Girl

01:10.722 --> 01:13.143
we love the mall,
and Depaulo loves opera.

01:13.144 --> 01:15.469
Therefore... we love opera.

01:15.470 --> 01:16.938
You do?

01:16.939 --> 01:18.623
Wonderful.

01:18.624 --> 01:22.038
So, Raven, what will you
and your sidekick be performing?

01:22.039 --> 01:24.151
What-what do you
mean, "sidekick?"

01:24.152 --> 01:27.276
Sidekick-- you know, a follower,
hanger-on, second banana.

01:27.828 --> 01:30.396
Mrs. Depaulo,
Chelsea and I--

01:31.047 --> 01:32.245
we're equal bananas.

01:32.246 --> 01:32.812
That's right.

01:32.813 --> 01:34.673
Okay, as far
as what our act will be

01:34.674 --> 01:36.885
all our decisions will be made
together.

01:36.886 --> 01:37.693
Chelsea, we're leaving.

01:37.694 --> 01:38.819
Right behind you.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:33.054 --> 02:34.561
Yep, that's me.

02:46.649 --> 02:48.213
Needs something...

02:48.684 --> 02:49.971
sweet.

02:52.319 --> 02:53.549
Freeze!

02:54.480 --> 02:57.295
Drop the marshmallows,
step away from the blender.

03:00.582 --> 03:02.649
Corey, what are you doing?

03:03.322 --> 03:05.101
My class is putting out
a fourth grade cookbook

03:05.102 --> 03:06.960
and we all had
to bring in a recipe.

03:06.961 --> 03:08.702
Honey, with recipes like this

03:08.703 --> 03:10.634
no one's going to make it
to the fifth grade.

03:10.635 --> 03:13.205
Nobody's going to fit
in the fifth grade.

03:14.311 --> 03:17.104
Son, what were you trying
to make?

03:17.105 --> 03:18.464
A dessert.

03:18.465 --> 03:19.698
I call it...

03:20.139 --> 03:21.730
"The Deliciator."

03:23.322 --> 03:24.826
Why didn't you come
to me for help?

03:24.827 --> 03:26.562
You know
I am a professional chef.

03:26.563 --> 03:27.491
Or me.

03:27.492 --> 03:29.490
I have this box full
of family recipes

03:29.491 --> 03:31.592
passed down
through the generations.

03:31.593 --> 03:32.718
Like your mother's fruitcake.

03:33.850 --> 03:35.489
I'm still waiting
for that to pass down.

03:36.471 --> 03:37.671
Well, it might have helped

03:37.672 --> 03:39.075
if you hadn't swallowed it
whole.

03:39.076 --> 03:39.944
I tried

03:39.945 --> 03:41.773
to bite it, but that
thing had no give.

03:41.774 --> 03:42.968
It's like
cement.

03:42.969 --> 03:44.132
Are you two fighting?

03:44.986 --> 03:46.544
No.

03:47.205 --> 03:48.861
Why don't you both
make me a dessert

03:48.862 --> 03:51.076
and I'll put the winning one
in my cookbook?

03:51.077 --> 03:53.044
Son, you're not going
to get your mother and me

03:53.045 --> 03:54.262
to compete against
each other.

03:54.263 --> 03:56.183
I mean... please.

03:57.192 --> 03:58.762
Are you scared?

03:59.129 --> 04:00.594
No way.

04:00.595 --> 04:01.930
Son, hand me my apron.

04:02.374 --> 04:03.963
Watch a real man in action.

04:06.085 --> 04:08.822
Yeah, it takes a real man
to wear pink.

04:12.662 --> 04:14.433
Hey, you two, how
was school today?

04:14.434 --> 04:15.568
Great, Mom.

04:15.569 --> 04:17.800
Chelsea and I signed up
to do an operatic duo

04:17.801 --> 04:19.391
for The Classical Arts Festival.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.642
I'm impressed.
What are you singing?

04:21.642 --> 04:22.872
I haven't decided yet.

04:23.384 --> 04:25.077
Why do you get to decide?

04:25.422 --> 04:26.883
Chelsea, are you
still tripping

04:26.884 --> 04:29.574
because Ms. Depaulo called
you my second banana?

04:29.575 --> 04:31.326
No, it's cool.
Of course not.

04:31.327 --> 04:32.283
Now, if you'll excuse me

04:32.284 --> 04:34.238
I'll be in your room
awaiting further instructions.

04:36.663 --> 04:38.426
Mom, tell me the truth.

04:38.427 --> 04:39.204
You don't think

04:39.205 --> 04:40.634
I boss Chelsea around, do you?

04:40.635 --> 04:41.509
Oh, yeah.

04:41.510 --> 04:43.554
Come on, seriously.

04:44.892 --> 04:45.850
Oh, yeah.

04:46.604 --> 04:47.997
Come on, honey.

04:47.998 --> 04:50.107
You have a lot of
great ideas, but

04:50.108 --> 04:51.338
every once
in a while

04:51.339 --> 04:53.669
you need to let someone
else have their say.

04:55.959 --> 04:57.822
Why?

04:58.680 --> 05:00.879
Honey, because
people don't like

05:00.880 --> 05:02.704
to be overshadowed
by others

05:02.705 --> 05:05.158
who act all superior
just because they went

05:05.159 --> 05:06.064
to cooking school

05:06.065 --> 05:07.671
and know how to
whip egg whites.

05:07.672 --> 05:08.977
Like that's so hard.

05:11.957 --> 05:13.161
Come back.

05:13.162 --> 05:15.068
Oh... sorry.

05:15.705 --> 05:17.896
Rae, Chelsea's
your best friend.

05:17.897 --> 05:19.361
Give her a chance.

05:19.362 --> 05:21.663
I'm sure she has
some wonderful ideas.

05:24.561 --> 05:26.113
We're going to be singing trees?

05:26.796 --> 05:29.377
Not just singing, Rae.

05:29.874 --> 05:31.170
Dying.

05:34.079 --> 05:36.057
Girl, that is...

05:37.112 --> 05:38.836
Gosh, it's a wonderful idea.

05:38.837 --> 05:41.526
Thanks... because
I was thinking

05:41.527 --> 05:42.993
you know, we take some opera...

05:43.351 --> 05:46.018
...but we write our own words,
you know?

05:46.565 --> 05:48.565
About something we just really
care about.

05:48.566 --> 05:49.431
Shopping.

05:50.142 --> 05:51.442
Um, no.

05:51.443 --> 05:53.929
Actually, um, something
like, you know, the environment.

05:53.930 --> 05:55.261
Like, um, acid rain.

05:55.262 --> 05:57.531
You know, how it just really
destroys trees and stuff.

05:58.602 --> 05:59.222
That's...

05:59.223 --> 06:00.371
That idea--

06:00.862 --> 06:02.547
it's a bit too
wonderful.

06:04.564 --> 06:05.845
You know, Rae if you...

06:05.846 --> 06:07.013
if you don't want to do this...

06:07.014 --> 06:08.212
No. Chelsea...

06:08.213 --> 06:09.276
go ahead, girl.

06:09.277 --> 06:10.624
You're the boss.

06:11.751 --> 06:12.720
Really?

06:14.009 --> 06:16.520
Okay, I'm the boss then.

06:17.180 --> 06:18.469
I mean, if that's okay with you.

06:19.677 --> 06:21.805
Hello. I don't have to ask you.

06:21.806 --> 06:23.071
I'm the boss.

06:30.104 --> 06:32.780
Okay, people, I'm
on a tight schedule.

06:33.862 --> 06:35.678
Make my mouth happy.

06:37.606 --> 06:40.266
Banana cream cheese cake.

06:40.267 --> 06:42.438
Nothing but the best
for my baby.

06:43.304 --> 06:46.165
Son, if you need
to rinse that bad taste

06:46.166 --> 06:47.061
out of your mouth

06:47.062 --> 06:49.634
I've lifted the ban
on drinking out of the carton.

06:55.140 --> 06:56.619
Excellent!

06:57.995 --> 06:59.180
I'm...

06:59.181 --> 07:01.045
I'm good, I'm good.

07:01.542 --> 07:03.910
Yeah, slow your
roll, Sara Lee.

07:04.512 --> 07:10.156
Son, get ready
for my fudgy fudge fudge cake.

07:11.744 --> 07:14.644
Open your mouth
and say, "Yum!"

07:18.229 --> 07:20.043
Awesome!

07:21.562 --> 07:23.388
Awesome is better
than excellent.

07:23.829 --> 07:25.100
Well, actually...

07:27.052 --> 07:28.292
it's a tie.

07:29.315 --> 07:31.096
So, I'm going
to need another round.

07:31.097 --> 07:32.240
What?

07:32.241 --> 07:33.669
Unless...

07:34.092 --> 07:35.686
one of you wants to give up.

07:36.217 --> 07:38.071
I believe he's talking
to you, Tonya.

07:38.701 --> 07:39.820
Oh, yeah?

07:39.821 --> 07:41.433
Well, bring it on...

07:41.434 --> 07:42.563
Fudgy.

07:51.123 --> 07:52.465
Oh, Eddie, Eddie

07:52.466 --> 07:54.200
since Depaulo made you MC

07:54.201 --> 07:56.020
you think you can
get us a good slot?

07:56.021 --> 07:58.375
Right. The, uh,
singing dead trees.

07:58.376 --> 08:00.083
There's a showstopper.

08:00.454 --> 08:02.096
Thank you.

08:02.873 --> 08:03.645
Oh, you know what?

08:03.646 --> 08:04.877
I left the rotten moss
in my locker.

08:04.878 --> 08:05.639
I'm going to go get that.

08:05.640 --> 08:08.366
Girl, you better go get...
get that rotten moss.

08:10.317 --> 08:12.402
I don't want to be a dead tree.

08:12.781 --> 08:14.358
Yeah. Who does?

08:14.359 --> 08:15.251
Eddie?

08:15.622 --> 08:18.396
This is the First Place trophy
for the festival.

08:18.397 --> 08:20.613
I call it "The
Depaulo Cup."

08:20.614 --> 08:22.334
It's an old bowling trophy.

08:22.797 --> 08:24.021
I know.

08:24.022 --> 08:25.670
File off my
ex-husband's name.

08:31.276 --> 08:32.039
Way to go.

08:32.039 --> 08:34.452
You and Chelsea make
a great team.

08:36.780 --> 08:37.388
Rae, Rae.

08:37.389 --> 08:38.048
Great news.

08:38.049 --> 08:39.315
The moss is
really rotten.

08:39.316 --> 08:40.558
They're going to smell
us in the back row.

08:40.559 --> 08:42.427
Yeah, girl.
Hey, put it down, put it down.

08:42.428 --> 08:44.848
I just had a vision
that we're going to win.

08:44.849 --> 08:46.239
Oh, my gosh,
are you serious?

08:46.240 --> 08:48.806
I totally knew the dead
tree thing was the way to go.

08:49.825 --> 08:52.819
Yeah, but, see,
when I had the vision...

08:52.820 --> 08:54.221
...I didn't see us

08:54.222 --> 08:55.353
in our trees.

08:55.354 --> 08:58.010
I- I was wearing a really
beautiful outfit.

09:00.057 --> 09:01.086
Yeah.

09:01.087 --> 09:03.015
Um, well, what
was I wearing?

09:03.920 --> 09:05.639
Yeah, I didn't see you.

09:07.283 --> 09:08.143
Hmm. How convenient.

09:08.144 --> 09:09.383
Hey, girl, listen.

09:09.384 --> 09:11.026
If we didn't have a chance
of winning

09:11.027 --> 09:12.539
I'd still go
with these trees

09:12.540 --> 09:14.148
but since we have a chance

09:14.149 --> 09:14.721
girl, I just think

09:14.722 --> 09:16.576
a good idea's better
than a dumb one.

09:16.942 --> 09:18.167
That didn't
come out right.

09:19.045 --> 09:21.449
You always think
your ideas are better than mine.

09:21.450 --> 09:22.778
Can we please
not fight now?

09:22.779 --> 09:24.380
Please, let's just
do it my way and win.

09:24.381 --> 09:25.970
What? What is your way, Rae?

09:25.971 --> 09:28.177
Sing about something
really stupid like shopping?

09:35.041 --> 09:37.841
This country was
built on shopping.

09:38.254 --> 09:40.445
And I think that
we should honor it.

09:40.446 --> 09:41.607
Well, you know what?

09:41.608 --> 09:43.342
You can honor it yourself

09:43.343 --> 09:45.566
'cause this tree stands alone.

09:45.968 --> 09:47.445
Fine, because your
tree is going

09:47.446 --> 09:48.918
to become my
shopping bag

09:49.726 --> 09:50.840
anyway.

09:50.841 --> 09:53.906
Rae, this is not
about trees, okay?

09:53.907 --> 09:55.196
It's about our friendship.

09:55.197 --> 09:56.029
And you know what?

09:56.030 --> 09:59.500
You just acid rained
all over it!

10:09.684 --> 10:10.622
Come on.

10:10.623 --> 10:11.780
You guys have been
friends forever

10:11.781 --> 10:12.995
and I'm not about to let you
ruin it

10:12.996 --> 10:14.347
over some silly argument.

10:14.348 --> 10:15.638
It's not silly,
Eddie, okay?

10:15.639 --> 10:17.982
She said that, for once,
we could go with my idea.

10:17.983 --> 10:20.053
That was before I had a vision
that we could win.

10:20.054 --> 10:23.845
Okay, wait, so, you're saying
that we can't win with my idea.

10:23.846 --> 10:25.462
Yeah, if we change it to mine.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.628
Enough.

10:28.092 --> 10:29.868
Now, Chelsea's mom gave me
this video

10:29.869 --> 10:31.744
and I think it's going
to help you guys remember

10:31.745 --> 10:33.258
why you're friends.

10:35.383 --> 10:37.694
I got a tree.
It's still a baby.

10:38.262 --> 10:40.593
Hey, Chelsea,
it's your birthday

10:40.594 --> 10:42.855
Get busy, get busy.

10:43.401 --> 10:44.579
This is Raven

10:44.580 --> 10:46.969
my bestest friend
in the whole wide world.

10:46.970 --> 10:49.214
And this is my bestest friend.

10:49.215 --> 10:50.545
Hug!
Hug!

10:52.259 --> 10:54.536
Aah... doesn't that just make
you want to go...

10:54.537 --> 10:56.014
Oh...
Oh...

11:00.049 --> 11:02.404
Yo, who's that cute
little fellow?

11:02.405 --> 11:04.399
I've got new sneakers.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.797
They're the bomb.

11:06.243 --> 11:08.242
Let's see you run, Eddie.

11:08.243 --> 11:09.110
Okay.

11:09.992 --> 11:11.727
Keep going.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.743
Keep going.

11:17.325 --> 11:18.901
Oh, look, it's
my birthday cake.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.932
MAN: Make a wish and blow
out the candles, Chelsea.

11:35.337 --> 11:36.314
What?

11:36.732 --> 11:38.714
Okay, time for cake.

11:46.376 --> 11:48.933
Oh, man, I probably should've
watched the whole tape.

11:50.176 --> 11:51.455
Now I remember.

11:51.456 --> 11:53.229
You blew out my candles.

11:53.683 --> 11:55.986
Well, who takes 20 minutes
to make a wish?

11:56.358 --> 11:59.333
I was wishing on each candle.

12:00.085 --> 12:02.452
Girl, it's one cake,
you get one wish, that's it.

12:02.453 --> 12:04.204
Oh, my gosh, so, it's
your rules again, Rae.

12:04.205 --> 12:05.048
Well, you know what?

12:05.049 --> 12:07.728
Thanks to you, none of
my wishes even came true.

12:07.729 --> 12:08.546
Yeah, you know what?

12:08.547 --> 12:10.241
You owe me a pony--
and a bike.

12:10.242 --> 12:12.025
Oh, and, that's right

12:12.026 --> 12:14.047
I blame you for global warming.

12:14.048 --> 12:16.877
Okay, so, I'm glad we worked
this one out.

12:16.878 --> 12:19.545
Now, you two will be going on
last, closing the show.

12:19.546 --> 12:21.040
I think it's a great spot.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.605
I am not performing
with the wish killer.

12:25.860 --> 12:27.727
Chelsea, you don't have
to perform with me.

12:28.405 --> 12:30.517
You don't even have to be
friends with me.

12:30.518 --> 12:31.778
Fine.
Fine.

12:31.779 --> 12:32.953
Not that fine.

12:32.954 --> 12:34.258
There's only one slot open

12:34.259 --> 12:35.221
and if you're not
doing it together

12:35.222 --> 12:36.697
then one of you is not doing it.

12:38.227 --> 12:39.384
Which one?
Which one?

12:44.699 --> 12:48.285
Corey's going to love my
chocolatey chunky chunk cookies.

12:49.027 --> 12:51.200
Well, not as much
as he's going to love

12:51.201 --> 12:54.410
my creamy dreamy
peanut butteremy cake.

12:55.497 --> 12:56.689
Backpack.

12:58.484 --> 12:59.882
What is this?

13:00.724 --> 13:02.928
"The Fourth Grade Cooks."

13:02.929 --> 13:04.762
They already have
a cookbook out.

13:05.225 --> 13:07.257
And that's Corey's recipe

13:07.258 --> 13:08.605
for the Deliciator.

13:09.743 --> 13:10.873
Then what are we doing?

13:11.183 --> 13:13.016
Send in the treats!

13:13.804 --> 13:15.948
Getting scammed
by a ten-year-old.

13:20.528 --> 13:24.004
You know we only live
to serve you.

13:24.005 --> 13:26.666
Well, if your desserts
aren't good enough today

13:26.667 --> 13:28.200
there's always tomorrow.

13:28.201 --> 13:31.142
Mmm, yeah, that's
'cause that cookbook's

13:31.143 --> 13:32.802
not coming out for
a while, right?

13:33.898 --> 13:36.106
Oh, yeah.
Could be weeks.

13:36.597 --> 13:37.962
Maybe months.

13:39.014 --> 13:40.521
Really?

13:40.522 --> 13:42.666
Then maybe I should do
a little more work on this.

13:42.667 --> 13:44.199
I want it to be perfect.

13:45.367 --> 13:46.300
Oh, it's perfect.

13:46.301 --> 13:47.165
Give me a cookie.

13:47.166 --> 13:49.068
I don't know.

13:49.069 --> 13:52.394
Maybe I used too many
chocolate chunks

13:52.395 --> 13:53.152
on it.

13:53.153 --> 13:54.921
Victor, what do you think?

13:54.922 --> 13:59.083
Mmm. Mmm, mmm, oh,
it's, I don't know.

13:59.084 --> 14:01.663
Is it supposed to be
this sweet and chewy?

14:01.664 --> 14:02.875
I like sweet and chewy.

14:03.689 --> 14:05.861
Now, see, Tonya,
I'm worried.

14:05.862 --> 14:10.727
I don't know if my cake is moist
and luscious enough for Corey.

14:11.467 --> 14:13.409
Let Corey be the judge.

14:15.060 --> 14:16.771
That is sweet.

14:16.772 --> 14:18.302
Mmm. Mmm.
And creamy.

14:18.837 --> 14:20.638
But is it up to
Corey's standards?

14:20.639 --> 14:23.158
I have no standards.
Mmm.

14:25.330 --> 14:28.014
It's like a flavor party
on my tongue.

14:28.015 --> 14:29.681
Could I have a piece?

14:31.122 --> 14:34.739
Oh, no, we seem to have
eaten all the desserts.

14:35.197 --> 14:37.527
Because they were
that good.

14:38.638 --> 14:40.855
Well, wh-what am I supposed
to eat?

14:41.155 --> 14:42.769
I don't know.

14:42.770 --> 14:43.866
Maybe we should look

14:43.867 --> 14:45.850
in the Fourth Grade Cookbook!

14:50.657 --> 14:51.624
Okay.

14:53.723 --> 14:55.813
I think the real issue
here is

14:55.814 --> 14:59.876
what were you doing
in my backpack?!

15:02.915 --> 15:04.721
Want to try that again?

15:06.762 --> 15:09.132
Uh... I love you?

15:13.122 --> 15:14.240
No.

15:15.601 --> 15:17.168
You lied to us.

15:17.169 --> 15:18.748
You manipulated us.

15:18.749 --> 15:20.353
You turned us against
each other.

15:20.354 --> 15:22.323
Okay. I'm sorry.

15:22.324 --> 15:23.716
No dessert for me tonight.

15:24.244 --> 15:25.404
Try a week.

15:26.687 --> 15:27.685
That's fair.

15:28.025 --> 15:29.692
And I'll clean up
the kitchen, too.

15:30.190 --> 15:31.120
Good.

15:31.667 --> 15:32.874
Now go to it.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.430
Try to play us, will he?

15:42.309 --> 15:43.645
Victor?
Hmm?

15:43.646 --> 15:45.987
There's a tray of cookies
and a half a cake in there.

16:00.742 --> 16:02.593
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

16:02.594 --> 16:04.791
I'm Edward Thomas,
your humble host

16:04.792 --> 16:06.764
for this evening's
cultural festivities.

16:10.651 --> 16:13.519
Yo, yo, yo, it's MC Ed
to the dizzle.

16:13.520 --> 16:16.226
And if you dig culture,
let me hear you holler.

16:18.722 --> 16:21.721
Dig that. Dig that.
All right. All right.

16:22.314 --> 16:23.245
Right on, right on.

16:23.246 --> 16:24.691
Settle, settle, settle, settle.

16:24.692 --> 16:27.196
First act up, they dance,
they prance

16:27.197 --> 16:28.712
and one of them is named Lance.

16:28.713 --> 16:34.186
Put your hands together
for your Bayside Swan Lakers!

16:38.995 --> 16:40.844
Eddie, I got your message.

16:40.845 --> 16:42.786
Thank you so much for
putting me in the show.

16:42.787 --> 16:44.288
No problemo.

16:44.289 --> 16:46.132
Hey, you're going to love
my shopping...

16:46.133 --> 16:49.428
# Opera. #

16:51.762 --> 16:53.535
Yo, yo, yo, yo,
Swany, Swany, Swany.

16:53.536 --> 16:54.471
The lake's that way.

16:54.472 --> 16:55.589
Get on, get on.

16:56.913 --> 16:57.658
Oh, my gosh, Eddie.

16:57.659 --> 16:59.690
Thank you so much for
giving me this spot.

16:59.691 --> 17:01.500
It was nothing. Really.

17:01.501 --> 17:04.967
Well, I guess I better slip into
something a little more woodsy.

17:07.521 --> 17:10.096
Mr. Thomas, did
I just hear you promise

17:10.097 --> 17:11.917
the last spot
to both those girls?

17:12.406 --> 17:15.782
Okay, I know it sounds crazy,
but here's my plan.

17:17.575 --> 17:19.352
Oh, I have no plan.

17:19.353 --> 17:20.624
Ms. Depaulo,
they're my best friends.

17:20.625 --> 17:22.118
I couldn't chose.

17:22.419 --> 17:23.835
Interesting dilemma.

17:24.265 --> 17:26.625
Let me just take a moment
to pretend I care.

17:28.346 --> 17:29.577
Glad that's over.

17:30.461 --> 17:31.931
Don't mess this up!

17:37.508 --> 17:39.539
Guys, this is torture.

17:39.540 --> 17:41.057
Can I get a snack?

17:41.058 --> 17:42.189
Okay.

17:42.190 --> 17:43.588
But no sweets.

17:56.667 --> 17:57.928
Beautiful, beautiful.

17:57.929 --> 17:58.996
I mean, that was just beautiful.

17:58.997 --> 18:01.129
Give it up
for Holly Hunkins, y'all.

18:03.792 --> 18:06.261
And now, for our final act
of this evening

18:06.262 --> 18:07.189
ladies and gentlemen.

18:07.190 --> 18:11.481
If you like music, drama
and possibly wrestling

18:11.482 --> 18:15.220
then you'll love the opera
stylings of Raven Baxter.

18:18.566 --> 18:22.620
And... or Chelsea Daniels.

18:23.824 --> 18:25.072
What?!
What?!

18:26.120 --> 18:27.084
Y'all have fun.

18:28.687 --> 18:29.681
Get off the stage.

18:29.682 --> 18:30.322
What are you
going to do?

18:30.323 --> 18:31.840
Blow out my candles?

18:31.841 --> 18:33.773
Let it go.

18:33.774 --> 18:37.251
# I'm a sad little tree
in pain #

18:37.252 --> 18:40.746
# Because I'm dying
from acid rain #

18:40.747 --> 18:44.238
# Come on, girlfriends,
let's heed the call #

18:44.239 --> 18:47.945
# The shops are waiting
at the mall #

18:49.810 --> 18:53.384
# The mall #

18:53.385 --> 18:56.694
# The tree #

18:56.695 --> 18:59.991
# Come on #

18:59.992 --> 19:05.583
# Oh, please, you just want
someone to boss around #

19:05.584 --> 19:09.215
# A little mouse
who never makes a sound #

19:09.216 --> 19:12.677
# You never minded
when I took the lead #

19:12.678 --> 19:16.021
# You said that I gave you
the push you need #

19:16.022 --> 19:18.061
# What's going on? #

19:18.062 --> 19:19.702
# This is my slot #

19:19.703 --> 19:21.744
# Talk to the tree #

19:21.745 --> 19:25.048
# Please stop fighting
or Depaulo blames me #

19:25.049 --> 19:27.006
# What's going on? #

19:27.007 --> 19:30.460
# You promised me
I could be the boss #

19:30.461 --> 19:33.886
# But who looks good covered
in rotting moss? #

19:33.887 --> 19:35.958
# Is that part of the song? #

19:35.959 --> 19:41.818
# Why don't you
understand how I feel? #

19:41.819 --> 19:45.375
# You're running long! #

19:53.500 --> 19:55.192
# Look, they like us #

19:55.193 --> 19:56.905
# I guess we're good #

19:56.906 --> 20:00.578
# It worked much better
than we thought it would #

20:00.579 --> 20:04.371
# I'm glad everything
worked out all right #

20:05.081 --> 20:09.736
# Good... night. #

20:23.760 --> 20:26.628
And now, our emcee
for the evening

20:26.629 --> 20:29.040
and my favorite student,
Eddie Thomas

20:29.041 --> 20:31.199
will announce
the judge's decision.

20:31.802 --> 20:32.669
Way to go.

20:32.670 --> 20:34.956
You and Chelsea make
a great team!

20:35.832 --> 20:36.838
We're going to win.

20:36.839 --> 20:38.352
Just like I saw it.

20:38.887 --> 20:41.920
And now, the winner
of the Depaulo Cup

20:41.921 --> 20:43.957
and the $100 gift certificate
is...

20:44.560 --> 20:46.155
Holly Hunkins!

20:54.792 --> 20:56.226
Rae, what happened
to your vision?

20:57.327 --> 20:59.218
I saw it right,
but I read it wrong.

20:59.827 --> 21:00.842
Sorry.

21:01.280 --> 21:02.105
It's okay.

21:02.656 --> 21:04.510
You know, we won a lot more

21:04.511 --> 21:06.526
than just a gift
certificate and a trophy.

21:06.527 --> 21:07.726
We sure did.

21:12.340 --> 21:13.911
Hey, Holly,
will you knock it off?

21:13.912 --> 21:15.132
You won already.

21:20.022 --> 21:21.645
Run, Chelsea!

21:21.646 --> 21:22.847
What are you doing?

21:22.848 --> 21:23.813
Run!

21:31.547 --> 21:33.673
You guys, what is
the big surprise?

21:33.674 --> 21:36.962
Just something that I owe you
from a long time ago.

21:37.334 --> 21:39.607
Happy fifth birthday.
Happy fifth birthday.

21:39.608 --> 21:41.782
Oh, my gosh,
you guys are the best.

21:41.783 --> 21:42.820
We know.

21:42.821 --> 21:44.563
Now go ahead and blow out
your candles.

21:44.564 --> 21:46.426
Wait, wait, first I have
to make a wish.

21:50.322 --> 21:51.166
You know what?

21:51.167 --> 21:52.615
I can think of something better.

21:57.476 --> 21:59.267
Gosh, that was too selfish.

22:02.089 --> 22:04.461
And the whole
rain forest, of course.

22:04.462 --> 22:06.511
You know, and the cheetahs.

22:07.897 --> 22:09.053
I love the cheetahs.

22:09.054 --> 22:09.975
And the monkeys.

22:09.976 --> 22:11.246
Did I say the monkeys?
