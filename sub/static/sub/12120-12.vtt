WEBVTT

00:48.170 --> 00:51.300
After everybody leaves is when I leave.

00:51.380 --> 00:53.470
And by the way,

00:53.550 --> 00:56.220
I don't want any of the guests to know

00:56.300 --> 00:58.600
that this party
will be my last night on Earth.

00:58.680 --> 01:03.480
I can't abide the idea of my nearest
and dearest relating to me differently.

01:03.560 --> 01:07.850
FYI, I plan to be dead by sunrise

01:07.940 --> 01:10.150
so go ahead and make brunch plans.

01:10.230 --> 01:11.900
That's really not funny.

01:11.980 --> 01:15.200
I know. I'm still sorting out
this gallows humor thing.

01:15.280 --> 01:18.070
It's always too far or not far enough.

01:18.160 --> 01:20.870
I honestly don't know
how Jeff Foxworthy does it.

01:21.740 --> 01:25.500
But... why do you want to die?
Are you depressed?

01:25.580 --> 01:27.000
No, it's nothing like that.

01:27.080 --> 01:29.960
I'm the happiest person I know.

01:30.040 --> 01:33.460
Exactly.
You're the happiest person I know.

01:33.550 --> 01:35.720
Have a little nip.

01:35.800 --> 01:40.640
Got this from a monastery in Tibet.

01:41.720 --> 01:45.640
They also make fudge
that'll knock your balls up your ass.

01:45.730 --> 01:49.650
How can you be serious about this?
This is insane.

01:49.730 --> 01:55.150
No, baby. This is the sanest decision
I have ever made.

01:55.820 --> 01:58.410
The cancer has come back.
It's everywhere.

02:02.700 --> 02:04.290
Oh, boy.

02:05.080 --> 02:07.620
Oh, boy, oh, boy. I'm so sorry.

02:07.710 --> 02:09.419
You and me both, sister.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.590
I'm refusing treatment this time.

02:12.670 --> 02:14.920
I'm not going through any more surgeries

02:15.010 --> 02:18.340
or radiation go-rounds or chemo.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.430
Hey, now. It wasn't all bad.

02:20.510 --> 02:23.720
You rocked the shit out of
some of those wigs we got you.

02:23.810 --> 02:27.020
You're right. It was not all bad.
But it was pretty fuckin' bad.

02:27.100 --> 02:29.020
Yeah, I know.

02:29.100 --> 02:32.860
You girls were so good to me
during that nightmare.

02:32.940 --> 02:37.690
And what was that joke
you used to tell me in chemo

02:37.780 --> 02:40.860
-that made me laugh so hard?
-Um...

02:40.950 --> 02:44.700
It... Mm... "Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
let down your golden hair.

02:45.240 --> 02:48.330
Sorry, I can't, I've got cancer,
you fucker."

02:49.330 --> 02:51.420
It's not as good as I remember.

02:52.170 --> 02:54.960
You'll have to come up with a new joke.

03:01.550 --> 03:03.350
You're asking a lot of me.

03:04.220 --> 03:06.850
But you're the kindest person I know.

03:06.930 --> 03:09.230
And in all my many travels,

03:09.310 --> 03:13.690
my most dearest treasured friend.

03:13.770 --> 03:16.820
Yeah, you say that to all the people
you ask to kill you.

03:22.320 --> 03:25.330
Just think about it. Take your time.

03:25.410 --> 03:28.950
But don't take too much time.
Let me know before tomorrow night.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.660
I will.

03:32.920 --> 03:38.300
From what I can tell, my cell phone
seems to be a little south of Tijuana.

03:38.380 --> 03:40.420
Odds are your cell's already been sold

03:40.510 --> 03:42.840
and your car's already got a plate on it
from an un-stolen car,

03:42.930 --> 03:44.470
but we'll do our best to recover it,
Mrs. Hanson.

03:44.550 --> 03:46.220
Thank you so much.

03:46.300 --> 03:49.600
And for the ride home.
And for letting me sit in the front.

03:49.680 --> 03:52.980
I didn't even do it yet!
Oh, my God, I was right,

03:53.060 --> 03:54.650
<i>Minority Report</i> is real.

03:54.730 --> 03:58.610
I don't know what you're so freaked out
about, but my car was stolen tonight.

03:58.690 --> 04:01.320
Oh. Big honking bummer.

04:01.400 --> 04:04.570
That's my roommate.
Maybe you could explain to the officer

04:04.660 --> 04:07.240
why you abandoned me
in a dangerous parking lot?

04:07.330 --> 04:08.370
I'd really rather not.

04:08.450 --> 04:11.710
Uh, no! I want to know
what was so pressing,

04:11.790 --> 04:14.210
so much more important
than my needing you to come--

04:14.290 --> 04:19.380
Would you pick up a person
who was drunk and emotionally assaultive?

04:19.459 --> 04:21.300
Do it every day.

04:21.380 --> 04:24.010
But I guess, yes,
if the person was a friend.

04:24.090 --> 04:26.760
Good answer. Your mother raised you well.

04:26.850 --> 04:29.850
And would you consider a person
a "good friend"

04:29.930 --> 04:34.480
if she was so plastered she called you
a failure in front of your sons,

04:34.560 --> 04:37.980
and told your new boyfriend
that you were afraid of sex in the vagina,

04:38.060 --> 04:41.690
and she ate the cake you made for him
with her hands?

04:41.780 --> 04:42.990
I ate cake?

04:43.070 --> 04:46.360
You also told me
that you would be better off without me

04:46.450 --> 04:48.240
and then you broke the toilet.

04:48.330 --> 04:50.370
I'm not sure I understand
the importance of the toilet.

04:50.450 --> 04:52.250
She flushed my geodes.

04:52.330 --> 04:54.330
Oh, in that case,
I'd say you did the right thing.

04:54.410 --> 04:57.330
-Ha!
-I would've also changed the locks.

04:57.420 --> 04:58.590
Thank you.

04:59.340 --> 05:03.130
Here's my card.
I'll call you if we find anything.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.340
Call me if she gets out of hand.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.680
You need to know, I don't remember

05:07.760 --> 05:10.180
-most of what I said or did--
-I'm not speaking to you.

05:10.260 --> 05:12.060
But I just--
I want to let you know that I'm--

05:12.140 --> 05:13.310
No, no. Store's closed.

05:18.190 --> 05:20.020
Oh, it's just if Macklin
didn't have a birthday party,

05:20.110 --> 05:22.360
and if I didn't have to go to the OB,
and if Mitch wasn't out of town--

05:22.440 --> 05:24.400
And I don't know
what is going on in there,

05:24.490 --> 05:26.030
but I can already tell they don't like me.

05:27.070 --> 05:28.990
That can happen.

05:29.070 --> 05:31.160
And right now I'm not too crazy
about you bums, either!

05:31.240 --> 05:32.740
Psst!

05:32.830 --> 05:36.120
Oh, no, she can't hear anything in those.
There is no Tooth Fairy.

05:36.210 --> 05:38.580
- See? Nothing.
- Hello.

05:38.670 --> 05:41.710
Hi, Grandpas!

05:41.800 --> 05:43.510
Hi, sweetie.

05:43.590 --> 05:47.680
Come on, let's go get you a juice box.
And then if you feel like it,

05:47.760 --> 05:52.350
we can look at pictures of houses
and condominiums online.

05:52.430 --> 05:53.520
Sol.

05:55.350 --> 05:56.690
Do you like magic tricks?

05:56.770 --> 05:57.980
No.

05:58.060 --> 06:00.110
Neither do I.

06:00.190 --> 06:03.530
Come on,
let's go look up condominiums.

06:03.610 --> 06:04.780
Yay!

06:05.490 --> 06:07.820
How long do I have to stay here?

06:09.740 --> 06:11.870
-You're looking for a new place?
-We are.

06:11.950 --> 06:14.200
Wow. OK, then are you sure
this is a good time?

06:14.290 --> 06:16.200
I mean, 48 hours ago
you weren't even speaking.

06:16.290 --> 06:18.250
Are you kidding? We're so excited.

06:18.330 --> 06:20.670
We couldn't think of anything
we'd rather do today.

06:20.750 --> 06:23.590
OK, well, I am glad someone
is going to be having a good time.

06:23.670 --> 06:26.460
Now I have to go pay a gyno to stick
a cold metal probe into my vagina.

06:26.550 --> 06:28.680
OK. Uh, drive safe.

06:34.470 --> 06:35.310
Mmm.

06:44.860 --> 06:45.730
Hi.

06:47.860 --> 06:50.360
Oh, is that a piñata for Babe's party?

06:50.450 --> 06:51.740
What's your agenda, lady?

06:51.820 --> 06:53.910
'Cause if you're trying to trick me
into talking to you,

06:53.990 --> 06:56.580
I will manifest my inner jackal
and you'll be sorry

06:56.660 --> 06:59.960
you ever tangled with my mangy inner ass.

07:00.040 --> 07:02.210
Oh, "inner ass," that's tough to stomach.

07:02.290 --> 07:03.920
Deal with it.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.630
Well...
I brought you something.

07:06.710 --> 07:10.800
I have a ton of stuff to do right now
and a lot to think about.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.840
Well, just let me give it to you.

07:12.930 --> 07:17.100
You know, I walked to the market
and they had these tiny wind chimes

07:17.180 --> 07:18.730
that you can put on your rearview mirror.

07:18.810 --> 07:20.310
No, thank you.

07:20.390 --> 07:22.650
I'm trying to apologize.

07:22.730 --> 07:26.150
You can't make it better
by buying me off with a gift

07:26.230 --> 07:27.980
like Robert used to do with you.

07:28.070 --> 07:29.740
He didn't buy me off.

07:29.820 --> 07:33.820
He was being thoughtful...
and he always made me feel better.

07:35.080 --> 07:39.000
-Just accept my apology.
-I can't do this now.

07:39.580 --> 07:41.040
Frankie, hear me out.

07:42.500 --> 07:43.420
I...

07:44.080 --> 07:47.170
I know I said hurtful things
that I'm not proud of.

07:47.250 --> 07:50.550
But the reason I got so drunk
that I said all that stuff

07:50.630 --> 07:53.300
is because it was
the shittiest day of my life.

07:53.390 --> 07:58.520
Frankie, um, I didn't break up with Phil
like I said I would.

07:58.600 --> 07:59.930
I...

08:00.020 --> 08:02.730
I went to a hotel
and we spent the night together.

08:05.190 --> 08:06.650
Well, say something.

08:06.730 --> 08:08.650
I'm sorry, what?

08:08.730 --> 08:11.570
Frankie, I slept with Phil.

08:11.650 --> 08:14.280
Then we broke up.

08:14.360 --> 08:15.990
I'm probably never gonna see him again.

08:16.070 --> 08:17.660
I'm sorry you're suffering.

08:17.740 --> 08:18.990
But that was not an apology,

08:19.080 --> 08:22.080
that was just an excuse
for your bad behavior.

08:22.160 --> 08:25.080
Not that I want to spend
a single second on this shit,

08:25.170 --> 08:28.290
but when you blame me
for pushing you to Phil,

08:28.380 --> 08:32.470
remember I'm the one that told you
not to get more involved,

08:32.549 --> 08:36.720
so if you're feeling worse now,
it's totally on you.

08:39.059 --> 08:40.720
How can you say that?

08:41.730 --> 08:47.150
My brain sends a message to my mouth
and it comes out. Neurology, Grace.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.740
Yet you can't possibly know.
You ready? Go ahead.

08:59.830 --> 09:02.000
Time to wash your hands for lunch.

09:02.080 --> 09:03.290
Ah, come on, I've got you.

09:03.370 --> 09:06.830
Up we go. Up we go.
We'll wash together.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.380
-Upsy-daisy.
-Want to turn on the water?

09:09.460 --> 09:12.710
-Go ahead. Yep.
-There we go.

09:12.800 --> 09:15.300
-Did it.
-Uh, not so fast, missy.

09:15.380 --> 09:16.760
You've gotta really wash 'em.

09:16.840 --> 09:18.850
Come on, we'll all do it together.

09:18.930 --> 09:21.100
-There we are.
-Get your whole hands in.

09:21.180 --> 09:25.440
-There you go.
-And really scrub up with those bubbles.

09:25.520 --> 09:26.980
Let me have some of that soap.

09:27.810 --> 09:29.360
This fuckin' guy.

09:39.570 --> 09:45.370
I understand a charge was made at the
Sergio Auto Emporium in Puerto Lobos,

09:45.460 --> 09:51.040
but I assure you I did not buy any tires
or naked lady mud flaps.

09:52.050 --> 09:56.930
-Well, thank you, I appreciate that.
-I have naked lady mud flaps.

09:57.010 --> 10:00.470
Girl, you are a naked lady mud flap.

10:00.550 --> 10:04.560
Oh, Babe. Frankie told me
you were back

10:04.640 --> 10:06.680
and I was so jealous
not to have seen you yet.

10:06.770 --> 10:10.520
Well, here I am in Technicolor 4D
Smell-O-Vision.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.570
Isn't this divine?

10:12.650 --> 10:16.690
Danny Day Lewis made it for me
when he went to perfume school.

10:16.780 --> 10:19.950
It's, uh, gardenia and rain

10:20.030 --> 10:23.700
and a bunch of other shit
he's too pretentious to divulge.

10:23.790 --> 10:28.370
-Yum. Wow.
-Oh, how are you, sweetie?

10:28.460 --> 10:30.290
Rock bottom.

10:30.380 --> 10:34.710
My life is in the crapper of the crapper
and Frankie's not talking to me.

10:34.800 --> 10:39.010
Mmm, sounds like you
might have something to do with that?

10:39.090 --> 10:42.260
I don't know why she has to blow
everything out of proportion.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.850
You know, I might have said some
terrible things to her, but I was drunk.

10:44.930 --> 10:47.390
-I didn't mean it.
-Oh, really?

10:47.480 --> 10:51.440
Did you know in North Korea
they use vodka as truth serum?

10:52.190 --> 10:53.060
No, they don't.

10:53.150 --> 10:56.110
Then Dennis Rodman's a fucking liar.

10:56.190 --> 10:58.030
Want-- Want some?

10:58.110 --> 11:02.450
No, thanks. But booze makes our id's
and shadow-selves

11:02.530 --> 11:05.410
pop out all over the place
and you should know that,

11:05.490 --> 11:09.960
because I believe I drank
a pint of tequila and asked you to--

11:10.040 --> 11:12.380
Hold you like a baby and sing:

11:12.460 --> 11:16.420
<i>♪ I love you a bushel and a peck ♪</i>

11:16.500 --> 11:19.880
Everybody likes to be tucked in,
don't they?

11:19.970 --> 11:23.090
-Not by me.
-Oh...

11:23.180 --> 11:27.890
Listen, toots, did you get my text?
I need my samovar for the party.

11:27.970 --> 11:29.560
You mean my samovar?

11:29.640 --> 11:32.940
I'm the one that spotted it
at the Rose Bowl in 1999.

11:33.020 --> 11:35.770
-You snooze, you lose.
-Well, I got it back.

11:35.860 --> 11:39.900
You stole it back for your
Boxing Day dinner that never existed.

11:39.990 --> 11:43.410
But it's your fault that you ever believed
I would have a Boxing Day dinner.

11:43.490 --> 11:45.120
Ah, there you are.

11:45.200 --> 11:49.410
I spoke with the pupusa guy
who's on his way from El Monte

11:49.500 --> 11:51.960
and the balloon lady
is confirmed for eight.

11:52.040 --> 11:55.080
Perfect.
Frankie's helping me tonight.

11:55.170 --> 11:58.090
Oh, no, no. I don't know
how much I'm helping you, OK?

11:58.170 --> 12:00.670
Well, don't take it out on Babe
just because you're mad at me.

12:00.760 --> 12:03.340
Oh, I have an amazing comeback to that,
but I can't say it

12:03.430 --> 12:06.470
-because I'm not talking to you.
-Oh, yeah, because you're just incapable

12:06.550 --> 12:07.810
-of giving up a grudge.
-Oh, incapable?

12:07.890 --> 12:09.810
-You don't know what capable is.
-Why don't you learn a little bit?

12:09.890 --> 12:11.890
No, no, let me tell you something.
If I--

12:11.980 --> 12:16.480
Hey, ladies? I know it's bad
between you right now,

12:16.560 --> 12:21.900
but I'd appreciate you putting your shit
on the shelf when you come to my party.

12:21.990 --> 12:26.200
Oh, Babe, it's sweet of you to invite me,
but as you can see,

12:26.280 --> 12:28.620
I'm not exactly in the party kind of mood.

12:28.700 --> 12:30.830
Oh, yes, you are.

12:30.910 --> 12:34.210
I think we're about done
with you telling me what to do.

12:34.290 --> 12:36.630
Babe, I promise
I'll come to your next party.

12:37.540 --> 12:39.920
That's not gonna work for me.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.720
-Why not?
-Because...

12:42.800 --> 12:46.090
-there isn't gonna be a next party.
-Why not?

12:46.890 --> 12:49.100
Because I'm not going to be here.

12:49.180 --> 12:50.390
Well, where are you going?

12:50.470 --> 12:52.640
Well, that depends on what you believe in.

12:52.730 --> 12:55.270
What are you talking about?

12:55.350 --> 12:57.270
Have a seat, toots.

12:58.480 --> 13:01.990
No. No, this can't be happening.

13:02.070 --> 13:05.280
-It is, sugar.
-You can't do this.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.280
She is doing it. She made her choice.

13:07.370 --> 13:11.240
-It's not her choice to make.
-Actually, it kind of is.

13:11.330 --> 13:14.540
Of course it is.
Her life. Her death. Her choice.

13:14.620 --> 13:18.580
Ooh, I like that. If I had more time
I'd get a T-shirt made.

13:18.670 --> 13:21.920
It's not right.
Only God can make that decision.

13:22.010 --> 13:25.130
-I thought you were mad at God.
-Well, he's gonna be mad at her.

13:25.220 --> 13:27.010
Oh, that's not the way she sees it.

13:27.090 --> 13:32.310
I have made my peace with my God, sweetie.
It's all cool in the pool.

13:32.390 --> 13:34.600
But maybe there's another option.

13:34.680 --> 13:40.360
There are none. As Dr. Randy says,
"No good outcomes."

13:40.440 --> 13:44.070
Why go through the horror of treatment
if it's not gonna work?

13:44.150 --> 13:46.320
No, no.
She's not going through that again.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.360
Listen to me.

13:48.450 --> 13:51.280
You cannot give up.
You have to keep fighting.

13:51.370 --> 13:54.080
But this is how I win, sweetheart.

13:54.160 --> 13:57.620
Besides, I don't want to go out fighting,
I want to go out flying.

13:57.710 --> 14:00.790
Maybe there's a new medicine
that hasn't been invented yet.

14:00.880 --> 14:05.260
You know, or...
a garden that you haven't planted,

14:05.340 --> 14:08.680
or a cave that you haven't spelunked,
or--

14:08.760 --> 14:12.430
What about Sting?
You always wanted to make out with Sting.

14:12.510 --> 14:13.600
Oh!

14:13.680 --> 14:16.980
I'm pretty sure that Trudie
will give you a special dispensation.

14:17.060 --> 14:18.730
They do have an open marriage.

14:18.810 --> 14:21.400
Maybe we can--
we can get him here in time.

14:21.480 --> 14:23.400
How could you go along with this?

14:23.480 --> 14:27.740
It's not my choice, but if--
if Babe wants to end her life tonight,

14:27.820 --> 14:29.990
then, yes, I would help her...

14:31.160 --> 14:35.580
I will help her do anything

14:35.660 --> 14:37.830
that supports her decision.

14:39.580 --> 14:41.580
-I'm in.
-Oh, thank you.

14:41.670 --> 14:44.130
You're a good friend.

14:44.210 --> 14:46.630
Oh, and you have such soft breasts.

14:49.260 --> 14:51.470
Oh, stop.

14:51.550 --> 14:53.220
I'm sorry, Babe.

14:53.890 --> 14:56.600
I love you dearly,

14:56.680 --> 15:00.140
but this thing that you want to do,
that you want me to support your doing

15:00.230 --> 15:02.980
goes against everything that I believe.

15:03.060 --> 15:05.320
I-- I can't be party to it.

15:07.610 --> 15:10.820
OK. I get it.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.990
I'll drop by later to say goodbye.

15:15.700 --> 15:17.580
You gotta remind me,

15:17.660 --> 15:20.790
'cause if I forget,
I'll fuckin' kill myself.

15:20.870 --> 15:22.460
Hey...

15:22.540 --> 15:26.550
I think I'm starting to
nail this gallows humor thing.

15:31.550 --> 15:34.180
When did your granddaughter
become Joe Pesci?

15:34.260 --> 15:36.100
She must have heard it somewhere.

15:36.180 --> 15:37.520
Where? At a cock fight?

15:37.600 --> 15:40.310
I don't know,
but kids repeat things they hear.

15:40.390 --> 15:43.980
My mother would wash my mouth out
with soap for every "hell" or "damn."

15:44.060 --> 15:46.770
And Grace and I would
dock the girls' allowances.

15:46.860 --> 15:49.860
Though I don't think little David Mamet
gets an allowance.

15:49.940 --> 15:52.990
So how do you want to handle this?

15:53.070 --> 15:56.370
- She didn't say it.
- Oh, she said it.

15:56.450 --> 15:58.790
No, it's impossible.
We don't use that word in our house.

15:58.870 --> 16:00.250
-You probably heard wrong.
-Mm-mm.

16:00.330 --> 16:03.040
What did we hear?
"This friendly guy"?

16:03.120 --> 16:05.380
-"This clucking guy"?
-No.

16:06.460 --> 16:07.380
OK.

16:11.720 --> 16:12.970
All right.

16:15.090 --> 16:18.930
Doc McStuffins
was just about to fix a kitten.

16:19.020 --> 16:22.350
OK. Madison, honey, when you were
with Grandpa and Grandpa earlier,

16:22.440 --> 16:25.690
-did you say the "F" word?
-What's the "F" word?

16:25.770 --> 16:29.820
Uh, it's a bad word. It starts with "F."

16:29.900 --> 16:34.860
You know, "fu..." F-Fu...

16:34.950 --> 16:37.330
Fallopian tube?

16:37.410 --> 16:41.950
See? That's the worst word she knows.
You are such a smarty pants.

16:47.380 --> 16:49.840
Hey!

16:49.920 --> 16:52.220
Oh, good girl!

16:53.010 --> 16:56.550
I replaced it with a bag of sand
like Indiana Jones.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.350
She'll see through it,
but I don't give a flap.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.730
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate your helping me.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.060
If you ever decide you
want to go out my way,

17:07.150 --> 17:10.069
I'll try to come back and help out.

17:10.150 --> 17:12.569
Unless I'm a caterpillar.

17:12.650 --> 17:14.700
Or a right-wing conservative.

17:17.410 --> 17:20.579
So you want to talk through
tonight's timeline

17:20.660 --> 17:22.619
so you know
what's on the docket?

17:23.500 --> 17:26.619
Let's do this. Let's get you dead.

17:26.710 --> 17:28.500
Sorry. I overshot that one.

17:29.170 --> 17:31.630
So, first,

17:31.710 --> 17:35.300
there are the drugs
which go in the pudding

17:35.380 --> 17:39.260
which you have made
and which I will eat myself.

17:39.350 --> 17:44.100
And then I'll do the bag-on-the-head thing

17:44.180 --> 17:49.360
and turn on this bad boy for insurance.

17:49.440 --> 17:52.730
So what, are we gonna do it out here?

17:52.820 --> 17:54.110
Al fresco?

17:54.190 --> 17:55.280
No, in the bedroom.

17:55.360 --> 18:00.530
And FYI, I'll be buck naked
because I like the way my sheets feel.

18:02.120 --> 18:04.540
You remember Skipper?
My surfer pal?

18:04.620 --> 18:08.080
-Oh, yeah.
-No shirt. Marvelous sensual energy.

18:08.170 --> 18:11.380
I remember his puffy drawstring pants.

18:11.460 --> 18:15.050
Well, he's helping, too.
He'll haul the tank into my bedroom.

18:15.130 --> 18:16.880
Don't worry about the body.

18:16.970 --> 18:19.970
Once I've left it,
Skipper will take care of everything else.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.270
What is it?

18:25.930 --> 18:27.310
I'm scared.

18:28.600 --> 18:29.560
Me, too.

18:29.650 --> 18:32.320
I've never done anything like this before.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.520
Me neither.

18:34.780 --> 18:37.490
But I'm more scared
of being a burden,

18:37.570 --> 18:42.160
and being in pain,
and of not being myself anymore.

18:42.240 --> 18:44.540
I couldn't bear that.

18:53.250 --> 18:55.840
My dear Frankie.

18:56.800 --> 18:59.800
You are so precious to me.

19:02.180 --> 19:04.560
I'm a very special person.

19:09.440 --> 19:12.440
-OK, what do you say to Grandpa?
-Thank you. Can I come back tomorrow?

19:12.520 --> 19:14.480
Of course you can.
Anytime, sweetheart.

19:15.150 --> 19:16.030
She said it.

19:16.110 --> 19:18.570
- Oh, like hell she did.
- Wait, wait, wait.

19:18.650 --> 19:23.990
Don't you leave here without giving
a great big hug to your Grandpa Sol!

19:24.080 --> 19:25.700
This fucking guy?

19:27.290 --> 19:29.000
Go play! Go watch TV!

19:32.960 --> 19:34.840
Oh, my God, she said it.

19:34.920 --> 19:37.170
Oh, my God, she said it about me.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.840
I'm "this fuckin' guy."

19:40.550 --> 19:43.510
OK. OK. OK, here's what
I think might have happened.

19:43.590 --> 19:45.220
Um, this one time,

19:45.300 --> 19:49.020
I might have referred to Sol as...

19:49.100 --> 19:50.480
You know, in that way.

19:50.560 --> 19:52.480
But it was right after
you had your heart attack

19:52.560 --> 19:54.810
and the whole thing with Frankie came out.

19:54.900 --> 19:57.190
-Oh...
-And I was really pissed.

19:57.270 --> 20:00.150
OK, you both cheat
on Mom and Frankie for years,

20:00.240 --> 20:02.780
and then you go and you cheat on him.

20:02.860 --> 20:05.320
And it's like,
is that all that goes on with men?

20:05.410 --> 20:08.620
They're just looking to cheat
or just thinking about cheating?

20:08.700 --> 20:10.250
I mean, cheat, cheat, cheat!

20:10.330 --> 20:12.750
Does every fucking guy
just cheat all the fucking time?

20:20.720 --> 20:22.800
I forgot Madison.

20:34.440 --> 20:36.730
You're really not going?

20:36.810 --> 20:41.150
Nope. I'm watching Byamba
pick up Big Joe by his diaper.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.700
You are making my gorge rise.

20:43.780 --> 20:47.530
Why? Because I'm not waving pom-poms
for you and Babe?

20:47.620 --> 20:49.200
You know I can't condone this.

20:49.290 --> 20:50.950
She's not asking you to condone it.

20:51.040 --> 20:54.170
She's asking you to be her friend
and to be there for her.

20:54.250 --> 20:57.960
No matter what you believe.
Because that's what friends do.

20:58.040 --> 20:59.710
-Not in my world.
-Oh, right.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.510
You only like people
who do things you approve of.

21:02.590 --> 21:05.220
No, because I have a high moral standard.

21:05.300 --> 21:09.050
And because you're incapable
of unconditional love.

21:22.070 --> 21:24.450
I am a terrible mother.

21:24.530 --> 21:28.700
I gave my daughter a potty mouth and
now she's watched six hours of TV today.

21:28.780 --> 21:32.660
-Great, can't wait to ruin the next two.
-Honey, I'm no psychologist.

21:32.750 --> 21:35.160
In fact,
I've never been to one because I'm Irish,

21:35.250 --> 21:37.750
but clearly something is going on here.

21:37.830 --> 21:42.050
I don't know.
I guess I'm just super hormonal or...

21:42.130 --> 21:44.260
Wait, no.
Why am I saying that?

21:44.340 --> 21:47.430
I have a mind and it knows things,
and you know what?

21:47.510 --> 21:50.050
Mitch has been delivering
a lot of night babies lately.

21:50.140 --> 21:51.720
Isn't that his job?

21:51.810 --> 21:53.390
OK, well, does he also work
at the Apple Store?

21:53.470 --> 21:55.940
Because he's been spending
a lot of time there, too.

21:56.020 --> 21:58.480
Does he not make appointments
at the Genius Bar?

21:58.560 --> 22:00.770
Because if you don't,
it's a really long wait.

22:00.860 --> 22:01.860
Sol.

22:01.940 --> 22:05.360
OK, listen, you guys cheated
for a long time. Right?

22:05.440 --> 22:07.570
What are the signs?
What do I look out for?

22:10.280 --> 22:15.370
This is delicate,
but is he any less amorous?

22:15.450 --> 22:17.540
Yeah, but because we're not allowed to.
Stupid babies.

22:17.620 --> 22:19.500
And frankly, I'm not super confident
in my blowjob--

22:19.580 --> 22:21.040
No, no. Nope.

22:23.250 --> 22:27.050
Is he suddenly going to
a lot of medical conventions?

22:27.130 --> 22:29.090
OK, that's where he is right now.

22:30.970 --> 22:36.100
OK, now let's not jump
to any conclusions here.

22:36.180 --> 22:38.310
You know Mitch loves you, right?

22:38.390 --> 22:40.690
The way you loved Mom?

22:40.770 --> 22:42.020
Oh, Mallory.

22:44.190 --> 22:46.860
I hate to see you feeling this way.

22:46.940 --> 22:50.030
I am so sorry if my behavior

22:50.110 --> 22:53.030
has had anything to do
with your anxieties right now.

22:53.120 --> 22:56.580
I promise you, not all men cheat.

22:57.660 --> 22:58.660
I know.

22:58.750 --> 23:03.170
And you have two more babies on the way.
It's a very stressful time.

23:03.840 --> 23:07.840
Oh, my God, I forgot there were two.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.050
-Oh, jeez.
-Oh.

23:19.060 --> 23:20.270
Oh!

23:20.350 --> 23:24.190
-Ahha! Ooh!
-Babe, is it everything you wanted?

23:24.270 --> 23:28.280
It's more, baby. It's more.

23:28.360 --> 23:29.950
Ohh...

23:30.610 --> 23:32.620
-Hello, my beauties.
-Aah!

23:32.700 --> 23:34.660
Young lady, may I have this dance?

23:34.740 --> 23:37.910
As long as you make it dirty.

23:40.460 --> 23:41.920
Skipper!

24:08.440 --> 24:10.280
- <i> Hello.</i>
- Hi, honey. It's me.

24:10.360 --> 24:12.320
Mom? Is everything OK?

24:12.400 --> 24:14.280
Every-- It's fine.

24:14.370 --> 24:16.910
I just haven't talked to you
in a few days and, um,

24:16.990 --> 24:18.540
you know, I miss you.

24:18.620 --> 24:21.870
Wait a minute,
I'm not hearing the clinking of ice.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.790
If you're not drinking,
something must really be wrong.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.880
<i>Not at all. It's just a...</i>

24:26.960 --> 24:31.170
It's a really weird... evening.

24:31.260 --> 24:34.930
And, uh, Babe's giving a party.

24:35.010 --> 24:36.390
<i>Why didn't you go?</i>

24:36.470 --> 24:39.850
No, I couldn't. I, um, I can't be there.

24:39.930 --> 24:42.730
But...
Frankie said something.

24:42.810 --> 24:47.690
And you listened? Come on, Mom, she thinks
that boomerangs have minds of their own.

24:48.610 --> 24:51.490
When you were a kid,
you felt loved, right?

24:51.570 --> 24:54.450
I mean, you know, unconditionally. Huh?

24:56.320 --> 25:00.660
Uh, well, no, Mom.

25:00.740 --> 25:03.290
That's not really your strong suit.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.460
-Oh.
<i>-But it makes sense.</i>

25:07.540 --> 25:10.460
<i>You're not very unconditional</i>
<i>with yourself.</i>

25:12.550 --> 25:14.840
I mean, I hope I didn't just offend you.

25:14.930 --> 25:17.340
I-- This is not a national secret, right?

25:17.430 --> 25:20.100
I guess not.

25:30.110 --> 25:31.110
You OK?

25:31.190 --> 25:35.200
It's getting to be time
for the pudding, puddin'.

25:35.280 --> 25:37.870
-OK, I'll be right back.
-Where are you going?

25:38.990 --> 25:40.870
I'm gonna get the pudding, puddin'.

25:47.290 --> 25:48.920
Oh! Frankie.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.380
Babe sent me to get the pudding

25:51.460 --> 25:54.260
and now that I see it
my body won't let me move.

25:54.340 --> 25:55.720
Are you sure it's your body?

25:55.800 --> 26:00.470
Whatever it is, it's cold on my breasts,
it's a very bad waste of electricity,

26:00.550 --> 26:05.310
not to mention I said I would help Babe
and now I can't do it.

26:05.390 --> 26:08.060
-I'm a terrible friend.
-Don't say that.

26:08.150 --> 26:09.940
If you had said to me
what I said to you,

26:10.020 --> 26:12.400
I'd be doing to you what you're
supposed to be doing to Babe.

26:12.480 --> 26:14.650
I do let things roll off my back.

26:17.280 --> 26:19.780
Do you believe
what Babe is doing is right?

26:19.870 --> 26:22.160
-Yes.
-Well, then, pick up the pudding,

26:22.240 --> 26:25.410
hand me that leftover chicken salad,
and get out of here.

26:46.180 --> 26:49.690
I just want to thank you all for coming.

26:49.770 --> 26:55.280
I'm so grateful
to have so many wonderful people

26:55.360 --> 26:59.200
from my life in the same room.

26:59.280 --> 27:01.200
I mean, holy shit,

27:01.280 --> 27:05.580
there's Baba Uday all the way from Tibet!

27:08.790 --> 27:12.920
And there's beautiful Tina Marie
all the way from the McMurdo Station

27:13.000 --> 27:15.960
-in Antarctica.
<i>-I love you, Babe!</i>

27:16.050 --> 27:18.880
I love you too, Tina Marie.

27:22.510 --> 27:23.640
Oh.

27:24.470 --> 27:29.390
As I live and breathe,
Grace Hanson is in the house.

27:29.480 --> 27:31.060
Let's give her a hand.

27:35.940 --> 27:39.530
And of course none of this
could be happening tonight

27:39.610 --> 27:43.950
without my dearest, my heart, Frankie.

27:49.250 --> 27:51.830
You all mean so much to me.

27:51.920 --> 27:55.460
You couldn't possibly imagine.

27:55.540 --> 27:59.510
It's a little bit... overwhelming.

28:01.430 --> 28:03.010
I love you all.

28:03.090 --> 28:06.180
Now get the hell out of my house.

28:14.650 --> 28:15.480
Babe...

28:16.230 --> 28:18.030
Oopsie.

28:18.110 --> 28:20.030
I don't know how to do this.

28:21.950 --> 28:23.490
I'm gonna miss you, too.

28:23.570 --> 28:25.280
Are you sure?

28:25.370 --> 28:28.620
I mean, don't you have any hope
that tomorrow will be a good day?

28:28.700 --> 28:33.210
You never know. You know, a miracle
could be right around the corner.

28:33.290 --> 28:37.090
I don't need a miracle, sugar.
I've had a really good ride.

28:37.170 --> 28:42.630
I've lived it hard and well.
With every breath, right?

28:42.720 --> 28:45.840
Inhale peace, exhale joy.

28:45.930 --> 28:49.390
Inhale peace, exhale joy.

28:49.470 --> 28:51.600
Ah, it sounds like horse shit,
I know,

28:51.680 --> 28:55.600
but the fact of the matter is
my cup runneth over.

28:56.480 --> 28:58.230
What will we do without you?

28:58.320 --> 28:59.980
You'll live.

29:00.980 --> 29:02.950
By the way, where's my joke?

29:04.110 --> 29:05.740
Oh, um...

29:05.820 --> 29:10.080
I'll never forget what my grandfather
said to me just before he died.

29:11.120 --> 29:14.620
"Are you still holding
the fucking ladder?"

29:34.600 --> 29:35.890
You OK?
