The people on that
ship were your friends,

42:04.632 --> 42:06.732
your family even, for a time.

42:06.734 --> 42:09.635
I understand that.

42:09.637 --> 42:12.755
But none of them can possibly grasp

42:12.758 --> 42:14.240
what you must do now

42:14.242 --> 42:17.943
to save the House of Ishida.

42:17.945 --> 42:20.446
Not like I do.

42:20.448 --> 42:23.115
Take my life if you will.

42:23.117 --> 42:26.218
I offer it gladly,

42:26.220 --> 42:30.156
knowing that what I did was
for the good of the Empire.

42:30.158 --> 42:31.690
<i>♪</i>

42:31.692 --> 42:34.193
But know this.

42:34.195 --> 42:36.462
One day, sooner or later,

42:36.465 --> 42:39.132
you will have to deal with them.

42:42.526 --> 42:47.338
