WEBVTT

00:02.840 --> 00:05.480
They got the guy responsible for the attack.

00:05.480 --> 00:06.840
It's Marcus.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.119
He was Remsey's 2IC.

00:08.119 --> 00:10.200
The media are reporting he was killed in the attack

00:10.200 --> 00:12.080
based on information coming from your office,

00:12.080 --> 00:13.600
but he wasn't even there at the time.

00:13.600 --> 00:16.280
That wound comes from point-blank range, not from 50 metres away.

00:16.280 --> 00:19.320
As their leader, Remsey will carry the can for the murders.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.720
He goes to jail, he's not coming out.

00:22.720 --> 00:25.880
There can be no doubt that the minister knew the Gangi family

00:25.880 --> 00:28.520
were in direct flight from persecution.

00:28.520 --> 00:32.360
We are going to protest about it in the morning.

00:32.360 --> 00:34.400
We're going to decrypt the file any more.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.600
We're going back to steal the keys, Jess.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.680
Come on. We've got to go.

00:38.680 --> 00:41.240
- What's Kaspion? 
- It's a crawler program.

00:41.240 --> 00:42.720
They release it across a network

00:42.720 --> 00:44.880
and it red flags every machine that's got a back door.

00:44.880 --> 00:48.080
There was a point where being silent was protecting him,

00:48.080 --> 00:50.880
but now, it's about saving him from himself.

00:50.880 --> 00:53.320
CROWD SHOUTS

00:53.320 --> 00:55.560
We've got a convoy of trucks heading up to the mine.

00:55.560 --> 00:57.040
There's a protest blocking the road.

00:57.040 --> 00:58.400
Trouble.

00:59.840 --> 01:03.120
SCREAMING

01:06.080 --> 01:08.480
GUNSHOT

01:08.480 --> 01:15.640
This programme contains some strong language

01:15.640 --> 01:18.560
Help! Help!

01:19.600 --> 01:21.480
Just breathe. Breathe, breathe, breathe.

01:21.480 --> 01:22.720
I need some help!

01:25.280 --> 01:27.640
Breathe. Trust me, just breathe.

01:29.720 --> 01:31.440
I'm in the town of Bitang Lembah,

01:31.440 --> 01:35.120
where unidentified militia fired on demonstrators this morning.

01:35.120 --> 01:38.160
Locals had gathered here to protest the treatment of Remsey Gangi,

01:38.160 --> 01:39.760
who was deported from Australia

01:39.760 --> 01:42.800
and arrested in relation to crimes he did not commit.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.400
It's hard to say what happened first.

01:44.400 --> 01:47.200
Rocks were thrown, warning shots were fired,

01:47.200 --> 01:48.640
then live shots were fired.

01:49.760 --> 01:51.040
People are just fleeing.

01:51.040 --> 01:52.800
EXPLOSION

01:55.480 --> 01:57.440
Mummy!

01:57.440 --> 01:59.920
Tahila. Come here. Come, come.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.120
Where are you going?

02:06.720 --> 02:09.600
Theo, can you take her home? I'll call you as soon as I can.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.200
HE SPEAKS IN OWN LANGUAGE

02:15.200 --> 02:16.680
Kiki's been shot.

02:22.720 --> 02:24.760
Look, Kiki, you've got to get up. It's going to hurt.

02:24.760 --> 02:26.520
It's going to be all right, though Come on.

02:26.520 --> 02:28.680
SHE SCREAMS

02:28.680 --> 02:32.000
It's all right, sweetie. Put your...put your hand. Come on.

02:38.360 --> 02:40.640
It's OK. We'll get in the back.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.840
Come on, let's go!

02:44.840 --> 02:47.600
It's all right, sweetheart. Just breathe, OK?

02:50.320 --> 02:52.680
If we can get her to the mine, there are medics there.

02:52.680 --> 02:55.680
Then they can chopper her out to Jayapura or even Darwin.

02:55.680 --> 02:58.480
KIKI GROANS

03:03.600 --> 03:06.080
It's all right. It's OK. Just breathe. Breathe.

03:06.080 --> 03:07.680
Breathe.

03:07.680 --> 03:10.200
FAST TEMPO MUSIC

03:12.000 --> 03:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:28.720 --> 03:31.160
You're staying here, right? We'll take her.

03:31.160 --> 03:33.480
If they see you, they'll arrest you.

03:34.720 --> 03:36.480
All right. OK.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.840
Just hang in there, all right?

03:39.840 --> 03:42.160
I'll come get you. I'll come get you.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.360
Got her?

03:55.520 --> 03:58.040
LOCK BUZZES

03:59.240 --> 04:01.040
This is Meg Flynn. Can you open up?

04:01.040 --> 04:02.760
I've got someone with me who's been shot.

04:02.760 --> 04:04.200
We need to get to the clinic.

04:06.560 --> 04:09.600
Hello! Is this working? Is anybody there?

04:09.600 --> 04:12.040
LOUDSPEAKER: 'Your pass has been cancelled, Miss Flynn.'

04:12.040 --> 04:14.360
There's been a misunderstanding. I'll sort it out later.

04:14.360 --> 04:16.440
We just need to get in now. This is an emergency.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.480
'You're not cleared to come onto the site anymore.'

04:18.480 --> 04:20.480
We don't care about the fucking clearance, mate.

04:20.480 --> 04:22.360
You need to open these gates now.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.880
Meg, I need to put her down. She can't breathe. Help me.

04:28.960 --> 04:31.760
Oh, no, no, no, no. What the fuck are you doing?!

04:31.760 --> 04:33.920
You need to get us in there, now.

04:35.960 --> 04:37.760
Move, move, move, move! Move!

04:44.040 --> 04:45.800
Oh, for the love of God!

04:46.840 --> 04:49.600
It's my wife! She's hurt! She needs help!

04:49.600 --> 04:51.720
Carter! Hey, Carter!

04:51.720 --> 04:53.080
You gotta open up!

04:54.200 --> 04:55.680
Darcy, it's me...

04:58.160 --> 05:00.720
Jesus Christ! She needs help!

05:01.880 --> 05:04.160
Please! Please!

05:19.480 --> 05:20.840
Kiki...

05:22.200 --> 05:23.520
Kiki.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.080
I wish there was something I could say

06:48.080 --> 06:50.200
which might make you feel better.

06:50.200 --> 06:53.440
It's OK. Papa said you're not very good at lying.

06:56.520 --> 07:01.360
BEEPING

07:26.160 --> 07:27.760
Where's Mama?

07:31.720 --> 07:35.200
INAUDIBLE

08:12.000 --> 08:14.240
This is so bad.

08:15.560 --> 08:17.200
So, so bad, Ned.

08:24.920 --> 08:29.960
I went in with him this morning, while you were at the protest,

08:29.960 --> 08:33.480
Into the, uh...OCO system.

08:33.480 --> 08:34.640
You what?

08:34.640 --> 08:38.120
You weren't there, and I needed to make a decision without you.

08:38.120 --> 08:39.520
What did you do in there, Jesse?

08:41.000 --> 08:43.240
We took the decryption keys,

08:43.240 --> 08:46.680
and when he went to get Tahila, I used the keys to...

08:46.680 --> 08:48.120
- KNOCK AT DOOR 
- Can you get the door?

08:48.120 --> 08:50.440
..to open Roth's file, to see what it is.

08:54.040 --> 08:55.560
It's a program called Kaspion.

08:57.720 --> 09:01.840
A web crawler that searches for and identifies

09:01.840 --> 09:04.920
the locations of Zero Days

09:04.920 --> 09:06.400
right around the world.

09:07.720 --> 09:10.520
- Zero Days? 
- System weaknesses.

09:10.520 --> 09:13.080
Once you find them, you've got Zero Days to fix them.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.880
'All programs and hardware have'

09:14.880 --> 09:17.560
unintentional flaws and security holes in them.

09:17.560 --> 09:20.200
There's also deliberate back doors built into systems

09:20.200 --> 09:21.680
to gain unauthorised access.

09:21.680 --> 09:22.920
Built by who?

09:22.920 --> 09:25.360
The big intelligence agencies have been doing it for years.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.480
No-one likes to admit it,

09:26.480 --> 09:29.560
but they also encourage patriotic companies to do the same.

09:29.560 --> 09:32.040
Computer equipment is ordered for export,

09:32.040 --> 09:35.080
then, en route, it's intercepted and back doors are installed.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.680
The equipment is then repackaged, given a new factory seal

09:37.680 --> 09:40.200
and sent on to the customer who's none the wiser.

09:40.200 --> 09:43.240
The agencies can then access those systems any time they want.

09:43.240 --> 09:45.480
Call it their windows on the rest of the world.

09:45.480 --> 09:48.440
Agencies spying is not exactly a new thing.

09:48.440 --> 09:51.440
Yeah, you're not getting it. It's not only about spying.

09:51.440 --> 09:56.080
With that list you...you can let yourself into any flawed system.

09:56.080 --> 10:00.120
Sure, you can spy, you can steal, but you can also control.

10:01.320 --> 10:03.280
Or...

10:03.280 --> 10:04.640
destroy.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.840
And I put it in Roth's hands.

10:10.680 --> 10:13.960
He...he releases it, it will roam the net

10:13.960 --> 10:17.840
and identify all the places where those back doors have been inserted.

10:19.960 --> 10:22.000
You get how valuable that list is?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.920
How dangerous it could be in the wrong hands?

10:24.920 --> 10:26.200
It gets worse.

10:26.200 --> 10:27.920
Just after the breach into OCO,

10:27.920 --> 10:30.560
Roth's wife was shot at a demonstration.

10:34.640 --> 10:37.920
She was protesting the treatment of Remsey since his return to Papua.

10:40.360 --> 10:42.920
We have to anticipate that he now has the capacity

10:42.920 --> 10:46.840
to control or paralyse major national systems.

10:46.840 --> 10:50.040
We've booked in briefings with all the emergency services,

10:50.040 --> 10:52.760
critical infrastructure, switching to high-alert protocols,

10:52.760 --> 10:55.720
but the truth is, if he wants in, he can get in.

10:55.720 --> 10:58.960
He targets the majors, post-Katrina analysis says

10:58.960 --> 11:01.600
that things would start to look very ugly day five.

11:01.600 --> 11:04.400
Do we have any Intel on what he might target or where?

11:04.400 --> 11:06.480
The attack would be digital, done remotely,

11:06.480 --> 11:09.680
so, in terms of a location, roll the dice.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.000
I'm ready.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.400
This footage was taken about an hour ago.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.840
Obviously, we've shared it with teams on the ground.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.040
How'd you go?

11:18.040 --> 11:20.960
We've calculated how far Roth could have travelled since that was taken.

11:20.960 --> 11:23.480
Search teams will start with a 70km radius from the mine

11:23.480 --> 11:24.760
and move inwards.

11:24.760 --> 11:27.480
It'll be laborious. Boots on the ground.

11:27.480 --> 11:29.280
But provided he didn't chopper out of there,

11:29.280 --> 11:31.360
the net will close on him eventually.

11:31.360 --> 11:33.320
Why didn't they just let him in?

11:33.320 --> 11:36.440
They could have flown his wife to a hospital, and yet...

11:36.440 --> 11:37.880
There's an endless stream of people

11:37.880 --> 11:39.560
turning up at the gates asking for help.

11:39.560 --> 11:41.080
There's no way they could've known...

11:41.080 --> 11:42.720
This is not just people, Neil.

11:42.720 --> 11:46.040
This is the wife of someone with already a really sharp axe to grind

11:46.040 --> 11:49.280
and they just let her bleed to death in his arms?

11:54.040 --> 11:55.960
Where's the briefing on this?

11:55.960 --> 11:58.240
The protest. The massacre.

11:58.240 --> 11:59.480
Massacre?

12:00.840 --> 12:03.960
Managed to conduct your own investigation this morning, did you?

12:03.960 --> 12:06.880
Counted injuries on each side.

12:06.880 --> 12:10.440
You have a meeting to finalise the Helmston mine lease

12:10.440 --> 12:11.960
before tomorrow's signing.

12:11.960 --> 12:14.080
Now, I spoke to the PM on the way in here.

12:14.080 --> 12:16.720
This incident will get a full investigation,

12:16.720 --> 12:17.840
but it's not a roadblock.

12:19.080 --> 12:20.760
Get that lease signed

12:20.760 --> 12:23.040
and seek an assurance from the Indonesian government

12:23.040 --> 12:25.200
that Remsey is being treated according to the law.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.960
And drop the inflammatory language.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.920
Funny, if we'd just accepted

12:30.920 --> 12:33.040
Remsey's application for asylum in the first place,

12:33.040 --> 12:34.680
maybe none of this would've happened.

12:34.680 --> 12:36.640
Am I the only one that's getting the irony on this?

12:38.200 --> 12:41.120
Pop into my office after you've met with the delegation.

12:41.120 --> 12:43.080
There's still a few wrinkles we should iron out.

12:47.960 --> 12:50.120
- Go on, say it. 
- I don't think I need to.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.200
It sounds like you already know what I'm going to say.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.800
Get me started, I'll finish off.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.520
Driving headlong into a brick wall...

12:55.520 --> 12:57.440
With scant regard for the consequences.

12:57.440 --> 13:00.360
Politics is a long game, etc, etc.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.800
This is not the plan I have for you.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.840
Or yourself, I imagine.

13:06.680 --> 13:08.760
Look...

13:08.760 --> 13:11.480
I understand if you want to unhitch your wagon.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.160
And why would I do that?

13:13.160 --> 13:15.440
Cos you're offering me the best possible advice

13:15.440 --> 13:17.560
and I don't appear to be taking it.

13:17.560 --> 13:20.360
I'm sure that's the second line of my job description.

13:23.160 --> 13:26.280
- PHONE BEEPS 
- Hi, Leonie.

13:26.280 --> 13:28.000
Yeah, thanks for calling me back.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.320
Right. What did she say?

13:43.120 --> 13:45.920
- Detective. 
- Minister.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.680
- Did you...? 
- No.

13:49.680 --> 13:51.680
Just...

13:51.680 --> 13:55.280
we're setting up a control room here, so I'm waiting.

13:56.840 --> 13:59.760
Trying to get my head around how things got to this.

14:01.560 --> 14:03.520
Not everything's stacking up to me yet.

14:04.720 --> 14:05.760
No.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.720
If you ever wanted to talk...

14:11.480 --> 14:12.840
Thank you.

14:16.040 --> 14:17.960
Come on, let's go.

14:27.240 --> 14:29.600
Some days it's just like

14:29.600 --> 14:32.480
being next to the brightest star in the universe,

14:32.480 --> 14:36.720
and other days it's like living on the edge of a black hole.

14:38.520 --> 14:40.560
Maybe what you say is true, Baba.

14:40.560 --> 14:43.000
Maybe if we end up together,

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
I will just drown trying to keep him afloat.

14:50.480 --> 14:52.000
I was wrong.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.960
For all the right reasons, but I was wrong.

14:59.240 --> 15:00.680
Your mother and I...

15:02.400 --> 15:06.320
..there are very strong currents pulling us in...

15:06.320 --> 15:09.360
different directions. But...

15:10.960 --> 15:12.680
..when the core is strong...

15:14.320 --> 15:18.440
..who am I to try to talk you into a different choice?

15:19.920 --> 15:23.400
He did not go back to try and save me, Hani.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.240
He was doing it for you.

15:26.760 --> 15:30.280
To take this splinter from your heart.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.160
And that someone would love my daughter that much...

15:46.320 --> 15:48.640
SHE SOBS

15:48.640 --> 15:50.400
Don't give up on him, Hani.

15:58.360 --> 16:00.040
It's probably safe to say my position

16:00.040 --> 16:02.320
as chief photographer for the mine is over.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.600
What happens if you get picked up?

16:07.800 --> 16:10.240
I'll be in breach of my visa.

16:10.240 --> 16:11.960
But just how deep the shit is

16:11.960 --> 16:13.720
will depend on what they catch me with.

16:13.720 --> 16:16.640
Which is why I have to get these pictures out of here.

16:16.640 --> 16:19.520
Then I've got to get to the hotel, get the rest of my gear.

16:30.160 --> 16:33.800
- What? 
- My external hard drive's there.

16:33.800 --> 16:35.920
All the pictures of Marcus' body are on it.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.640
Oh, shit!

16:37.640 --> 16:39.640
I thought I picked it up before I left.

16:39.640 --> 16:41.880
Well, I have to go get it.

16:41.880 --> 16:43.200
He's, er...

16:44.440 --> 16:45.680
He wants some whisky.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.360
I don't know if this is even possible,

16:49.360 --> 16:51.880
but we need to find a way to destroy the Kaspion files

16:51.880 --> 16:54.400
or put them back or...something.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.800
Even if I could get the files,

16:56.800 --> 17:00.040
I can't get into the OCO without Jan, anyway.

17:00.040 --> 17:02.480
What do you mean, "if" you can get the files? Where are they?

17:03.960 --> 17:06.440
They're on a drive, locked in there.

17:06.440 --> 17:08.359
And he's got the key.

17:08.359 --> 17:10.400
If you can get in there,

17:10.400 --> 17:13.800
is that something you can do, delete the files?

17:13.800 --> 17:16.680
And then what? You don't think he'd notice?

17:16.680 --> 17:19.319
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling kind of attached to being

17:19.319 --> 17:22.520
alive and the chances he would kill me for that are...

17:22.520 --> 17:24.560
If he uses it, it's on our heads, yeah?

17:24.560 --> 17:25.680
You are getting that?

17:27.359 --> 17:29.680
In fact, you're the one who helped him steal the keys,

17:29.680 --> 17:31.080
so it's on your head.

17:31.080 --> 17:33.720
So maybe you can put a little bit of effort into finding a solution.

17:34.800 --> 17:38.000
As lo-fi as it sounds, the only solution I can see

17:38.000 --> 17:41.760
is that he drinks himself into a coma,

17:41.760 --> 17:43.640
then I can try and sabotage the files.

17:43.640 --> 17:44.880
Meaning what?

17:46.040 --> 17:47.720
I'm not sure yet, but...

17:48.880 --> 17:52.080
..if I can find a way for the program to appear functional,

17:52.080 --> 17:55.320
the...the bullets have effectively been removed.

17:57.080 --> 18:00.240
Even if I can, it'll only buy us so much time

18:00.240 --> 18:02.000
till he works out what's happened.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.640
Well, I'm going to go and get my gear.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.920
- Maybe I should come with you. 
- I'll be all right.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.280
It's OK, you don't have to look after me.

18:13.280 --> 18:16.800
I'll be engaged only in the dangerous business of bartending.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.960
- I'm not sure chirpy is really... 
- Appropriate?

18:18.960 --> 18:21.600
Excellent(!) Situation normal.

18:24.240 --> 18:25.720
Off you go.

18:40.880 --> 18:42.120
Still no result?

18:44.160 --> 18:45.600
Does that surprise you?

18:46.640 --> 18:49.040
- No. 
- Why not?

18:49.040 --> 18:51.680
Because he's smarter than everyone in this building put together.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.800
I would try again, assuming you'd like the opportunity

18:55.800 --> 18:57.240
to talk him back from the ledge.

18:58.240 --> 19:00.240
Are you capable of speaking directly?

19:02.080 --> 19:05.520
- Is she like this all the time? 
- I have the right to remain silent.

19:06.600 --> 19:09.120
You want direct? This is direct.

19:10.120 --> 19:12.240
Your boyfriend has aligned himself with a man

19:12.240 --> 19:14.960
who is making enemies of some of the most powerful people in the world.

19:14.960 --> 19:17.880
If Roth uses the program, he's looking at life in prison

19:17.880 --> 19:19.600
and, depending on where they catch him,

19:19.600 --> 19:21.600
that comes with a death penalty on top.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.840
Jesse helped him get it. The charges apply to him as well.

19:24.840 --> 19:28.760
And, frankly, given the level of cooperation so far,

19:28.760 --> 19:30.400
I can't think of a single person

19:30.400 --> 19:32.840
who could actually be arsed to try and stop it.

19:34.360 --> 19:37.200
So, like I said,

19:37.200 --> 19:39.000
take it or leave it,

19:39.000 --> 19:40.640
but enough with the whining.

19:47.120 --> 19:50.000
- Motherfuckers! 
- That's three.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.800
Pretty sure there were five.

19:56.840 --> 19:59.720
Right, that's the fourth guy. I think there's one still inside.

20:04.280 --> 20:06.320
Meg, Meg, no, listen. There's still a guy inside.

20:06.320 --> 20:08.320
- There were four. 
- No, there were five!

20:15.800 --> 20:17.840
MAN SPEAKS IN OWN LANGUAGE

20:26.600 --> 20:29.240
SCREAMING

20:38.440 --> 20:39.840
You all right?

20:41.200 --> 20:42.520
I'm fine, I'm fine.

20:55.360 --> 20:56.840
Goddamn bastards.

20:58.080 --> 20:59.800
Without the photos of Marcus,

20:59.800 --> 21:01.640
there's no way to prove that Remsey was set up.

21:03.160 --> 21:05.320
It'll be his word against theirs.

21:07.760 --> 21:12.000
And this is just...another murder,

21:12.000 --> 21:13.680
and no-one held to account.

21:49.880 --> 21:52.320
Papa wants two sugars in his tea

21:52.320 --> 21:54.320
but nothing in his whisky.

22:00.040 --> 22:01.320
He gets very upset

22:01.320 --> 22:04.120
when we don't put it in the same place every time.

22:04.120 --> 22:07.320
He says we need to be able to find them in a hurry.

22:09.880 --> 22:12.280
What about you, young lady? Are you thirsty?

22:13.880 --> 22:16.240
- Hungry? 
- I don't know.

22:21.400 --> 22:26.280
Sometimes...I get so busy thinking,

22:26.280 --> 22:28.360
it's like I forget my body even exists.

22:31.160 --> 22:34.040
Is there something you think you could eat?

22:34.040 --> 22:35.520
I could eat a banana.

22:36.880 --> 22:38.320
It's an excellent choice.

22:40.160 --> 22:42.640
Full of all sorts of things they say are good for you.

23:05.760 --> 23:07.320
Oh.

23:38.360 --> 23:39.520
Ned?

23:39.520 --> 23:41.520
GUNSHOT

23:41.520 --> 23:43.800
Hey... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.800
- Ned? 
- Hey, shh.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.400
HE PANTS

23:49.400 --> 23:51.480
Just a bit of a delayed shock reaction.

24:09.760 --> 24:11.360
Oh, you've got the shakes.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.840
Do you know why you get the shakes?

24:16.840 --> 24:18.400
I'm sure I'm about to find out.

24:20.920 --> 24:23.440
I'm fine. Everyone can stop staring at me now.

24:23.440 --> 24:24.960
Yeah, of course you are.

24:24.960 --> 24:26.680
You just run on adrenaline for a while

24:26.680 --> 24:28.720
and then the smallest thing can flood you.

24:28.720 --> 24:32.120
A spot of hyperventilation and your carbon dioxide levels tanked.

24:32.120 --> 24:33.960
A bit of history with it.

24:33.960 --> 24:37.680
I'm usually the hyperventilating brother, not him.

24:37.680 --> 24:39.560
Well, I guess today's your day off.

24:45.520 --> 24:47.520
I've got a bunch of stuff to download.

24:47.520 --> 24:50.400
I'll be working right here the next four or five hours.

24:50.400 --> 24:51.760
I'll keep an eye on him.

25:09.160 --> 25:10.760
Thank you.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.880
THUDDING

25:46.720 --> 25:49.960
Conventional wisdom says that sleep can be a good thing

25:49.960 --> 25:52.160
at times like this.

25:52.160 --> 25:53.440
Yeah, well...

25:55.040 --> 25:57.880
..I shut my eyes for a few minutes...

25:57.880 --> 26:00.040
then I wake up and have to relive the whole thing again.

26:04.920 --> 26:06.520
That accounts for me.

26:07.480 --> 26:09.400
Why don't you take your own advice, Jesse?

26:10.960 --> 26:12.920
Well, I was trying to rest.

26:12.920 --> 26:16.120
There was this quite disturbing sound that was bothering me.

26:16.120 --> 26:19.640
- A kind of smacking. 
- You are a shitful liar.

26:21.040 --> 26:22.840
- Really? 
- Yes.

26:22.840 --> 26:24.480
But it's perfect.

26:24.480 --> 26:26.480
It means you're going to have a hard life because

26:26.480 --> 26:28.920
sometimes telling the truth doesn't serve anyone.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.240
What did you do, Jesse?

26:36.720 --> 26:39.040
I used the decryption keys.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.440
I opened the files.

26:42.320 --> 26:44.720
Of course you did. Why the fuck wouldn't you?

26:44.720 --> 26:49.040
I'm worried, Jan. I'm worried about what you're going to do with it.

26:49.040 --> 26:51.080
Really? It's not yours to worry about, is it?

26:51.080 --> 26:52.920
Well, since I helped you steal it,

26:52.920 --> 26:56.040
it kind of does feel like it's mine to worry about.

26:59.040 --> 27:01.120
I want to know.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.440
They don't listen to words,

27:03.440 --> 27:05.400
but they're very good at hurting people,

27:05.400 --> 27:07.720
so I think I'm just going to start speaking their language.

27:07.720 --> 27:10.800
I know what that means in a very general way,

27:10.800 --> 27:13.840
but I can't get a hold of it, I need...

27:16.240 --> 27:17.760
Do you need specifics?

27:19.400 --> 27:21.840
Well, I haven't decided what systems I'm going to target yet,

27:21.840 --> 27:24.040
but...what I do know is...

27:25.120 --> 27:27.840
..nobody pays attention unless a lot of people are screaming.

27:27.840 --> 27:30.760
So, they think it's all right for us not to have a hospital,

27:30.760 --> 27:33.560
so maybe...I shut theirs down.

27:34.800 --> 27:38.200
I take their light, I take their power.

27:38.200 --> 27:40.760
Because sometimes what you need is a little chaos on the street

27:40.760 --> 27:43.040
so you can refocus on the things that really matter.

27:43.040 --> 27:45.080
But the wrong people get hurt that way.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.320
Well, that will be a cost

27:46.320 --> 27:48.880
that the powers that be will have to decide to pay.

27:50.440 --> 27:52.000
Not me.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.360
I'm going to lay it out straight.

27:54.600 --> 27:58.120
Release Remsey, put the referendum back on the table,

27:58.120 --> 28:01.280
start talking about sharing the profits that come out of here

28:01.280 --> 28:03.080
and nobody's going to suffer too long.

28:06.280 --> 28:08.480
It's not your problem.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.000
Nothing to do with you.

28:13.440 --> 28:15.120
Unless you want to step up.

28:18.240 --> 28:21.000
Maybe we can get Hani out, or her family.

28:24.720 --> 28:26.280
Sleep on it.

28:28.320 --> 28:31.160
If you want in...cool.

28:34.360 --> 28:37.080
If not, well, you've done your job.

28:37.080 --> 28:39.520
I'll pay you the Bitcoin, I'll get you a couple of passports

28:39.520 --> 28:41.720
and you and your brother can just wander off.

28:44.240 --> 28:47.120
But you cannot take this away from me.

28:48.600 --> 28:49.760
Papa?

28:50.760 --> 28:53.840
Yes, sweetheart. I'm good, darling. I'm just, um...

28:55.480 --> 28:56.840
Go on in.

28:56.840 --> 28:59.320
Papa's going to have a wash, and then he'll put you to bed.

29:17.600 --> 29:19.160
Thank you.

29:22.120 --> 29:24.240
I'm just downstairs if you need anything.

30:36.160 --> 30:39.920
NED GROANS

30:46.560 --> 30:48.760
Hey. It's all right.

30:50.200 --> 30:52.960
It's all right. It's...it's just me.

30:54.400 --> 30:55.800
Sorry, I was...

30:57.600 --> 31:00.480
- I was dreaming. 
- It's going to happen a bit.

31:01.880 --> 31:05.000
You've just got to accept it's the psyche's way of processing stuff.

31:06.720 --> 31:08.320
It'll go away eventually.

31:09.360 --> 31:10.480
Probably.

31:15.080 --> 31:16.960
No, it wasn't about that.

31:21.520 --> 31:23.320
It was about my mum.

31:27.320 --> 31:30.520
I was at the funeral and I was crying

31:30.520 --> 31:33.320
and...for some reason, without my permission,

31:33.320 --> 31:35.480
my father was there holding me, and I...

31:41.360 --> 31:42.880
..I didn't want him...

31:44.920 --> 31:46.560
I couldn't move my arms.

31:47.880 --> 31:49.680
I was paralysed.

31:49.680 --> 31:51.280
I thought maybe I should bite him.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.160
Maybe that'd make him let go, but I couldn't even manage that.

31:58.800 --> 32:00.480
I was just trapped there.

32:02.160 --> 32:04.760
Trapped there,

32:04.760 --> 32:07.960
being comforted by the man who dumped you for something better.

32:14.400 --> 32:17.440
It's not a dream about your mum, Ned.

32:17.440 --> 32:18.880
No.

32:23.560 --> 32:25.200
I'm very tired...

32:27.200 --> 32:28.360
..inside.

32:30.640 --> 32:32.560
It's been a big day.

32:40.880 --> 32:43.160
Lies. Liar.

32:44.560 --> 32:45.920
Terrible liar.

32:56.400 --> 32:59.240
No, really, I love that on you.

33:00.600 --> 33:02.360
No, really.

33:02.360 --> 33:03.640
I love that on you.

33:04.800 --> 33:07.280
No, really.

33:07.280 --> 33:09.640
Then interest rates just killed it.

33:09.640 --> 33:11.720
And then interest rates just killed it.

33:13.240 --> 33:15.840
That was delicious. Couldn't possibly fit in another bite.

33:15.840 --> 33:17.520
That was delicious.

33:17.520 --> 33:19.640
I'm thinking about bi-fold doors.

33:21.600 --> 33:25.920
So then we can get the whole indoor-outdoor thing happening.

33:30.400 --> 33:33.400
Tried to get the key but he was up and down all night.

33:34.800 --> 33:36.480
Didn't really get a chance.

33:41.880 --> 33:43.160
It's ready.

33:44.400 --> 33:46.000
Off it goes.

33:48.520 --> 33:51.240
MESSSAGE SEND TONE

33:52.800 --> 33:55.000
PHONE MESSAGE TONE

34:26.800 --> 34:28.199
Morning.

34:28.199 --> 34:31.760
Do, um, either of you have any painkillers?

34:31.760 --> 34:35.080
- I've got a cracking hangover. 
- Yeah, I've got some.

34:36.360 --> 34:40.159
- Thought you didn't drink. 
- Turned over a new leaf.

34:40.159 --> 34:43.440
Did Roth sleep? Were you able to get the key?

34:47.760 --> 34:50.960
He was up and down all night. Didn't really get a chance.

34:56.760 --> 35:00.640
Security forces crack down on a peaceful march.

35:00.640 --> 35:03.680
Things get out of hand, shots were fired, and then away it goes.

35:05.200 --> 35:07.760
- Just another day in Papua. 
- But is it?

35:07.760 --> 35:09.800
Remsey is the leader of a non-violent group.

35:09.800 --> 35:11.720
Why is he so dangerous to them?

35:11.720 --> 35:14.920
So dangerous that they frame him for a crime he didn't commit,

35:14.920 --> 35:16.200
and then when people come out

35:16.200 --> 35:18.880
to protest his innocence about that crime,

35:18.880 --> 35:20.760
they're gunned down in the street.

35:23.040 --> 35:25.480
Someone went to a lot of trouble to frame Marcus

35:25.480 --> 35:27.320
and, by default, Remsey.

35:27.320 --> 35:29.480
Why did they do that?

35:29.480 --> 35:32.400
He's been causing grief left, right and centre.

35:32.400 --> 35:35.080
This was a perfect opportunity to sideline him.

35:36.120 --> 35:37.480
Feels like more than that.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.760
I've got a copy of the pictures,

35:48.760 --> 35:50.720
of the soldiers finding Marcus' body.

35:50.720 --> 35:52.520
Marina's minder pushed them out of her hand

35:52.520 --> 35:53.800
and gave them to me. Remember?

35:53.800 --> 35:55.760
- Where are they? 
- They're at my place.

35:55.760 --> 35:57.000
I could get someone to go round

35:57.000 --> 35:58.920
and scan the pictures and email them to us.

35:58.920 --> 36:01.960
How many people do you know like you enough to do that kind of favour

36:01.960 --> 36:05.160
- that aren't in your phone or your contact list? 
- Yep, he's right.

36:05.160 --> 36:07.760
Everyone you're in touch with will be on a surveillance list.

36:07.760 --> 36:09.520
You call them, we're toast.

36:11.080 --> 36:13.440
Well, there is someone who's not on my email or my phone list

36:13.440 --> 36:15.440
who owes me big time.

36:20.120 --> 36:24.360
Right. You're still a boxer man, eh? God, I hate those things.

36:24.360 --> 36:25.800
'Yeah, I remember. Can we have the'

36:25.800 --> 36:27.480
underpants conversation another time?

36:27.480 --> 36:29.200
Sure, sure, they were just en route.

36:30.400 --> 36:32.320
Um...

36:32.320 --> 36:33.480
Desk.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.960
Oh, right.

36:42.960 --> 36:44.840
You passed with flying credits, I see.

36:44.840 --> 36:47.400
Are you looking for the pictures, or are you just snooping now?

36:47.400 --> 36:49.520
Your mother would've had something to say about that.

36:49.520 --> 36:51.000
She hated mediocrity.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.200
Yeah, well, unfortunately, by the time I finished university,

36:54.200 --> 36:56.600
she was delivering her little pep talks from the nursing home

36:56.600 --> 36:58.920
and I was busy babysitting her other son.

37:04.200 --> 37:05.520
'Ah, God.'

37:05.520 --> 37:06.960
- Dad, what is it? 
- Did you find them?

37:09.760 --> 37:11.080
Dad, what is it?

37:11.080 --> 37:14.280
I just...I just found a bottle of Vintage.

37:14.280 --> 37:18.360
Oh, Dad, there is a guy capable of crippling half of Asia.

37:18.360 --> 37:20.560
Can you stop poking around in my stuff

37:20.560 --> 37:22.320
and look for the pictures?

37:22.320 --> 37:23.840
Yeah, all right, all right. Just...

37:25.600 --> 37:26.800
You know, it's just

37:26.800 --> 37:29.040
'very nice, you know.'

37:29.040 --> 37:30.760
'Thousands of options,'

37:30.760 --> 37:32.640
you choose to wear this one.

37:32.640 --> 37:35.000
Yeah, well...

37:35.000 --> 37:38.120
Mum gave it to me last Christmas when she thought I was you.

37:38.120 --> 37:40.280
'So don't go'

37:40.280 --> 37:42.400
cooking it into something it's not, all right?

37:43.880 --> 37:46.440
'Yeah, well, I would buy that, Neddie,'

37:46.440 --> 37:48.000
if the bottle were full.

37:50.480 --> 37:52.360
Now, where do you want me to send these photos?

38:03.800 --> 38:05.360
Hold on a sec.

38:05.360 --> 38:07.560
Can I see the pictures from the protest?

38:27.240 --> 38:29.280
Can you zoom in on that?

38:34.040 --> 38:37.520
Bloody hell, he's mine security.

38:37.520 --> 38:40.120
He's a witness to Marcus being dumped after the attack.

38:40.120 --> 38:43.800
We find him, we prove Marcus' innocence,

38:43.800 --> 38:46.080
there's no crime for Remsey to take the blame for.

38:56.600 --> 38:59.560
- Where are you? 
- I need a favour.

38:59.560 --> 39:02.840
Er, I don't know if I'll be able to fly that path.

39:02.840 --> 39:06.000
I need to know which security guards were on last Friday

39:06.000 --> 39:08.360
patrolling the mine road where the surfers were killed.

39:08.360 --> 39:09.640
Oh, yeah, why is that?

39:09.640 --> 39:12.160
Take a look at the picture I'm about to send you.

39:12.160 --> 39:15.400
There's a guy on the right-hand side behind some bushes.

39:18.920 --> 39:21.840
PHONE MESSAGE TONE

39:21.840 --> 39:24.440
I'll see if I can find you an alternative flight.

39:24.440 --> 39:25.840
I'm just going to put you on hold.

39:49.080 --> 39:52.920
So Ian Asselte, Brian Matthews, Mark Brown.

39:52.920 --> 39:55.600
All on duty last Friday, now all on leave.

39:55.600 --> 39:59.400
But they never patrol in threes. It's always in a unit of four.

39:59.400 --> 40:02.480
- So where's the fourth guy? 
- Well, I did some digging around,

40:02.480 --> 40:06.360
and at 5.30 the day of the attack, an urgent flight plan was logged.

40:06.360 --> 40:08.200
Franz was the pilot on.

40:08.200 --> 40:11.440
He requested clearance for a medivac from the mine to Darwin Hospital.

40:11.440 --> 40:14.120
Now, you have to include the reason for the medivac,

40:14.120 --> 40:16.480
the medical condition, illness, accident,

40:16.480 --> 40:18.560
and you take a medic with you.

40:18.560 --> 40:22.320
There's no explanation and no name of the doctor who flew with him.

A Helmston security guard gets secretly medivaced out of West Papua

40:36.400 --> 40:40.040
just after two Australians are shot dead on the mine road.

40:40.040 --> 40:42.000
I need to know who makes the decision

40:42.000 --> 40:43.680
to withhold that information.

40:48.240 --> 40:51.600
Shit, Marina. That's a big question to ask.

40:51.600 --> 40:54.080
What are you going to do with the answer?

40:54.080 --> 40:58.920
Just, UH...asking for information at this point.

40:58.920 --> 41:01.440
To be honest, I'm not even sure

41:01.440 --> 41:03.520
I'm going to be around to make the accusation.

41:05.680 --> 41:09.880
Did you hear about my daughter's scholarship to the university?

41:11.720 --> 41:15.440
A favour from the Vice Chancellor to someone.

41:16.680 --> 41:18.600
- Not you? 
- No, not me.

41:21.080 --> 41:22.680
Either way, I'm screwed.

41:24.200 --> 41:27.800
Take away the one thing that's made her happy over the last ten years,

41:27.800 --> 41:29.880
and I'm personally screwed.

41:29.880 --> 41:33.840
I let her keep it, and I leave a grenade in my career path, and...

41:36.520 --> 41:38.680
..I don't even know who's holding the pin.

41:40.360 --> 41:42.960
If you had to, could you hazard a guess?

41:42.960 --> 41:46.640
Yeah, there are a few people out there sharpening their knives.

41:46.640 --> 41:48.320
Do you know the guard's name?

41:51.600 --> 41:55.360
Burrows. Daryl Burrows.

41:57.560 --> 41:59.880
I'll see what I can find.

41:59.880 --> 42:01.280
Thank you.

42:29.400 --> 42:33.160
Not for immediate release. Just to keep in the stores.

42:35.600 --> 42:37.600
Flexing of the ministerial muscle

42:37.600 --> 42:41.400
to get her daughter a scholarship, apparently.

42:41.400 --> 42:43.920
But don't let me write it for you.

42:43.920 --> 42:47.400
- How long have you worked for her? 
- Seven years.

42:47.400 --> 42:49.880
Meal ticket one day, knife in the back the next.

42:49.880 --> 42:52.000
She's the gift that keeps on giving.

43:02.840 --> 43:04.400
You really love him, don't you?

43:06.760 --> 43:08.400
Uh-huh.

43:08.400 --> 43:13.000
In a, like, "never could imagine being with anyone else" kind of way?

43:13.000 --> 43:14.520
Uh-huh.

43:14.520 --> 43:17.440
And never even thinking about what could have been.

43:21.680 --> 43:23.200
Just me, then.

43:25.320 --> 43:27.880
We did this, Anton.

43:27.880 --> 43:30.320
We went around this block, like, ten times.

43:32.480 --> 43:33.760
We did.

43:35.200 --> 43:37.360
And nine times I managed to claw my way back

43:37.360 --> 43:38.640
from the edge of the cliff.

43:41.320 --> 43:43.720
I know it's a bit of a cliche, but...

43:45.000 --> 43:46.920
..I can't think of a different way to say it.

43:48.880 --> 43:50.840
The new version of me is better.

43:54.840 --> 43:56.360
Stop it.

44:00.800 --> 44:02.600
I don't get how you can work here...

44:04.320 --> 44:05.840
..in this greyness.

44:08.920 --> 44:10.840
I mean, at least if you were a black hat,

44:10.840 --> 44:13.480
you stood for something, then I could respect that.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.720
I know.

44:19.760 --> 44:21.560
What do you stand for, Hani?

44:27.960 --> 44:29.440
I don't know.

44:32.520 --> 44:34.120

I destroy the program,

what kind of guarantee do I get that we're going to be OK,

46:17.480 --> 46:20.200
that Hani's dad stays?

I don't want you to destroy the program.

46:22.720 --> 46:24.440
I want you to bring it to me.

'This will be an arrangement just between us.'

- I have it for 24 hours. 
- 'So you can do a bit of'

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000

46:33.000 --> 46:36.240
Then I get the right to negotiate its safe return to the Americans.

46:36.240 --> 46:37.720
For a fee.

46:37.720 --> 46:39.800
And the chance to promote the service of your company

46:39.800 --> 46:42.720
to all those vulnerable sites on the list.

46:42.720 --> 46:45.800
Vertex is not a charity, Jesse.

46:45.800 --> 46:47.240
And in the grand scheme of things,

46:47.240 --> 46:49.760
I'll be doing what the police and others have failed to achieve.

46:49.760 --> 46:52.120
I'm not going to apologise for charging a fee.

46:52.120 --> 46:55.160
'And I will make a condition of the software's return'

46:55.160 --> 46:57.840

47:00.800 --> 47:03.360
How do I know that you'll follow through?

47:03.360 --> 47:05.960
You have no track record of integrity here.

47:05.960 --> 47:08.040
No.

47:08.040 --> 47:10.560
Traded that in a while back.

47:10.560 --> 47:12.320
Let's make the benchmark different.

47:14.440 --> 47:16.600
'I'm assuming you're capturing the CCTV

47:16.600 --> 47:19.680
'and I've just incriminated myself fairly heavily.

47:21.720 --> 47:22.840
'from my perspective.'

48:56.920 --> 48:59.600
Sure. Of course.

48:59.600 --> 49:02.520
No doubt they'll be hunting us after yesterday.

Wrapped up in so many fucking layers of bullshit.

49:47.160 --> 49:50.760

49:50.760 --> 49:53.440
That's their third name change in three years.

49:59.800 --> 50:03.760
HelmSec is a subsidiary of Vertex International.

50:31.200 --> 50:33.560
You don't know me. Nolan Daniels.

50:33.560 --> 50:34.800
If my thinking's straight,

50:34.800 --> 50:36.920
you probably don't know the man who'll take the fall

50:36.920 --> 50:39.120
for your itchy trigger finger last Friday either.

50:39.120 --> 50:40.720
- I've got nothing to say to you. 
- No?

50:40.720 --> 50:43.880
I've got heaps, so you just stop me when I veer off the rails, eh?

50:43.880 --> 50:46.440
You and the boys, out patrolling the road.

50:46.440 --> 50:49.360
Everyone's a bit twitchy cos there's been a bit of trouble.

50:49.360 --> 50:50.640

50:55.920 --> 50:57.280

Can't get into the cops. Army won't have you.

My contract prohibits me from speaking about operational matters.

51:33.880 --> 51:36.320
Let me just tell you how this is going to play out.

51:36.320 --> 51:39.480
One morning, they will take Remsey Gangi from his cell,

51:39.480 --> 51:42.160
march him into a field, take his shirt off,

51:42.160 --> 51:45.600
mark a target on his heart and shoot him dead

51:45.600 --> 51:47.040
for something you did.

51:48.320 --> 51:50.640
I'm going to make it my personal mission to make sure that

51:50.640 --> 51:53.160
that doesn't happen without your name shackled to it.

52:03.040 --> 52:05.600
Hey. Yep.

52:05.600 --> 52:08.160
Now we just have to wait and see if he goes squealing to Mummy.

52:10.600 --> 52:13.000
You said everything would be taken care of.

52:13.000 --> 52:14.880
I was told it was sweet.

52:14.880 --> 52:17.840
Look, I'm not really quite sure what you're talking about, Mr Burrows.

52:17.840 --> 52:21.000
I'm in a meeting right now, but the legal team will be in touch shortly.

52:32.240 --> 52:33.680
Oh.

52:33.680 --> 52:36.160
Um... Hello.

52:37.320 --> 52:40.080
- Buzby. 
- Yes, that's me.

52:42.720 --> 52:45.360
I want to be upfront with you, Buzby.

52:45.360 --> 52:47.880
I need to ask if you're prepared to do something for me.

52:49.200 --> 52:52.160
Something which involves going into some...

52:52.160 --> 52:54.280
debatable areas of legislation.

52:56.640 --> 52:59.400
At some point in the next 48 hours,

52:59.400 --> 53:03.440
I might need someone to run a military erase on our system.

53:04.920 --> 53:08.680
If it were to look like an attack from Roth, all the better.

53:08.680 --> 53:10.680
The eradication of documents,

53:10.680 --> 53:12.960
with the full knowledge they're about to be subpoenaed.

53:12.960 --> 53:15.320
There isn't anyone else, I think,

53:15.320 --> 53:17.720
who understands that the cutting of certain corners

53:17.720 --> 53:20.840
is the only way to save us from the worst of what's coming.

53:25.400 --> 53:28.240
Yeah, we're heading back soon.

53:28.240 --> 53:31.160
I just heard that they might be moving Rems.

53:31.160 --> 53:34.040
Yeah, I'll let you know. Bye.

53:43.000 --> 53:47.800
Lara Dixon is CEO of the Asia-Pacific arm of Vertex.

53:47.800 --> 53:50.840
There's one of her in half a dozen countries around the world.

53:50.840 --> 53:52.800
Is the profit and loss there?

53:52.800 --> 53:54.320
Cos I've been trying to find out

53:54.320 --> 53:57.000
if they've also been paying local security forces.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.440
There was a bit of lunch room talk

53:58.440 --> 54:00.640
about paying extra fees to local militia

54:00.640 --> 54:02.800
to help keep the mine road operational,

54:02.800 --> 54:04.600
but I could never prove it.

54:04.600 --> 54:07.840
Where am I going to find that? Under P for Protection Money?

54:07.840 --> 54:10.640
Mine security gets into a bad situation with Roth

54:10.640 --> 54:12.960
that results in two Australians shot dead.

54:12.960 --> 54:15.680
Too big a screw-up to explain away,

54:15.680 --> 54:17.920
so a quick call to their local contacts,

54:17.920 --> 54:20.640
who are happy to clean it up, for a fee.

54:20.640 --> 54:23.120
So the guy that puts a bullet in Marcus Kombian's head

54:23.120 --> 54:25.640
gets pocket money from an Australian company.

54:41.760 --> 54:43.800
There are more patrols on the road.

54:43.800 --> 54:46.320
- We have to get out now. 
- Jesse...

54:47.560 --> 54:49.480
..you have to call Meg and Ned.

54:49.480 --> 54:52.280
- Tell them to meet us there, OK? 
- I haven't finished packing stuff.

54:52.280 --> 54:54.320
HE SPEAKS IN OWN LANGUAGE

54:54.320 --> 54:57.000
- No! 
- Tahila!

54:57.000 --> 55:00.520
- Tahila! 
- I'll get the stuff. I'll meet you there. Go!

55:00.520 --> 55:03.200
- You go. We'll meet you on the road near the bridge. 
- OK.

55:13.560 --> 55:17.560
BEEPING

55:45.320 --> 55:48.120
HE SCREAMS

55:51.240 --> 55:52.640
Argh!

56:03.160 --> 56:05.800
PHONE RINGS

56:06.960 --> 56:08.920
Hello?

56:08.920 --> 56:11.640
- Who's this? 
- Jesse, it's Anton.

56:19.560 --> 56:21.720
HE SCREAMS

56:22.305 --> 56:28.516
