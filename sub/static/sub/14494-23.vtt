00:21.465 --> 00:23.273
<i>Shto?</i>

00:49.565 --> 00:51.518
Director Hill, we've got a problem.

00:53.339 --> 00:55.330
We're losing all systems.
Something is--

01:01.990 --> 01:03.835
<i>I am Ultron-6,</i>

01:03.865 --> 01:07.472
<i>A cybernetic intelligence</i>
<i>created by doctor Henry Pym.</i>

01:07.722 --> 01:11.043
<i>My imperative is to bring peace</i>
<i>and order to this world.</i>

01:11.293 --> 01:14.203
<i>I am about to fulfill</i>
<i>that imperative.</i>

01:14.802 --> 01:18.677
<i>For the extinction</i>
<i>of humanity begins now.</i>

02:18.744 --> 02:20.565
This can't be happening.

02:21.476 --> 02:25.887
I can't believe he's gone--
That Thor is gone.

02:26.821 --> 02:29.982
Should-- should we move
his hammer?

02:30.303 --> 02:32.928
- Hulk maybe--
- Can't move it.

02:32.958 --> 02:34.286
Can't even pick it up.

02:34.946 --> 02:38.542
- Why not?
- Because I'm not Thor.

02:39.226 --> 02:40.673
How could this happen?

02:40.703 --> 02:42.768
- I can't believe that Hank--
- What?

02:42.947 --> 02:45.875
You can't believe that your
boyfriend's pet robot went nuts?

02:45.905 --> 02:50.021
That it put Captain America in the hospital
and almost took down the whole team?

02:50.051 --> 02:52.818
We were lucky.
Thor wasn't.

03:04.143 --> 03:06.006
I can't believe
this is happening.

03:06.036 --> 03:07.697
How many others are there?

03:07.727 --> 03:09.390
This is the last of them.

03:09.420 --> 03:12.080
That's every Ultron component
that was at the mansion.

03:12.110 --> 03:15.305
42 is clear, so is the lab
at Grayburn College.

03:15.608 --> 03:17.697
I just don't understand
what went wrong.

03:17.894 --> 03:20.394
Ultron was supposed
to be a force for peace,

03:20.424 --> 03:23.108
- for order.
- Hank, this isn't your fault.

03:23.355 --> 03:27.695
I was just as responsible. I pushed using
Ultron as a weapon from the start.

03:27.725 --> 03:30.163
The work we did at Stark
Industries, before you left--

03:30.193 --> 03:32.389
Ultron was my responsibility.

03:32.657 --> 03:34.800
I'm the one who
allowed this to happen.

03:35.050 --> 03:36.621
I just--

03:36.871 --> 03:40.835
I just don't understand how I could've
created something that would do this--

03:40.865 --> 03:42.930
Something that would kill Thor.

03:47.020 --> 03:50.984
Ooh, this is why
I saved you, my love.

03:51.014 --> 03:52.814
This is all I ever wanted.

03:53.012 --> 03:55.315
To the two of us alone,

03:55.345 --> 03:57.726
to the two of us alone.

04:01.399 --> 04:05.095
We will be together.
Forever.

04:06.345 --> 04:09.083
There was a massive series
of upgrades in Ultron's CPU.

04:09.113 --> 04:10.836
I'm trying to pinpoint the cause.

04:10.866 --> 04:14.210
Tony, I map human brain patterns
onto a machine.

04:14.240 --> 04:17.973
Any one of a million things could have
gone wrong, It's a completely new--

04:19.329 --> 04:22.098
It's me. I used my own brain
waves as a template--

04:22.128 --> 04:24.037
A starting point
to create Ultron.

04:24.067 --> 04:25.805
My mind made it go bad.

04:25.835 --> 04:28.573
The first sign of deviation
came after Kang's invasion.

04:28.823 --> 04:31.912
And Ultron-5 did interface
with Kang's tech. Maybe--

04:31.942 --> 04:34.962
Wait. This isn't Ultron-5.

04:34.992 --> 04:37.766
- What?
- This body, it's not the original one.

04:37.796 --> 04:40.873
The programming has been uploaded
into it according to this data stream.

04:40.903 --> 04:44.748
Ultron's been transferring its intelligence
into new bodies, over and over.

04:44.778 --> 04:47.008
The last time it did it
was an hour ago.

04:47.419 --> 04:49.365
- That's after we destroyed it.
- Yeah,

04:49.544 --> 04:51.606
so where did it
transfer its A.I. to?

05:42.430 --> 05:44.430
Stark, what are you--

06:00.167 --> 06:02.364
That's a lot of Iron Mans.

06:02.828 --> 06:05.971
<i>You attempted to destroy me, Avengers.</i>

06:06.400 --> 06:07.792
Ultron?

06:09.251 --> 06:11.037
You failed.

06:13.644 --> 06:16.162
I want all systems back up, right now.

06:16.192 --> 06:18.846
And, Sitwell, get me Tony Stark.

06:47.557 --> 06:51.498
<i>Maria Christina Hill,</i>
<i>director of SHIELD.</i>

06:51.528 --> 06:56.837
<i>As such, you are in possession of information</i>
<i>not contained in any database on the planet.</i>

06:56.867 --> 07:00.141
<i>The security codes</i>
<i>for the worldwide SHIELD arsenal.</i>

07:00.480 --> 07:02.241
And you think I'm gonna
hand them over to you?

07:02.473 --> 07:04.063
<i>You misunderstand.</i>

07:04.259 --> 07:05.777
<i>I am not asking.</i>

07:59.623 --> 08:01.838
- Hawkeye!
- Whoa!

08:17.947 --> 08:19.679
Tony, it's Ultron.

08:19.709 --> 08:21.804
He's taken over your armor.
All of them!

08:23.733 --> 08:24.984
I'm coming with you.

08:25.014 --> 08:27.978
No, stay here. Destroy the rest
of the Ultron pieces.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.996
- We have to make sure--
- Wait.

08:30.514 --> 08:32.693
The SHIELD helicarrier
is under attack.

08:33.121 --> 08:35.960
- It's Ultron.
- We would Ultron attack SHIELD?

08:35.990 --> 08:38.025
He's programming.
What he said before.

08:38.056 --> 08:41.400
The only way he can achieve his goals
is through the extinction of humanity.

08:41.431 --> 08:44.330
Shield has the ability
to do that.

08:50.394 --> 08:51.902
<i>Ahh!</i>
<i>Thor, wait!</i>

08:51.932 --> 08:53.993
<i>Have at thee, machine!</i>
<i>No!</i>

08:54.023 --> 08:56.948
This-- this is not right.

08:56.978 --> 08:59.123
- My love?
- I--

08:59.712 --> 09:01.748
I was in battle.

09:02.141 --> 09:04.426
There was a flash of light.

09:06.176 --> 09:08.069
Do not be troubled, Thor.

09:08.245 --> 09:10.227
Such memories will go--

09:12.745 --> 09:15.870
You will return me
to Midgard now, witch.

09:16.870 --> 09:18.986
Or by Odin you will know my fury.

09:19.219 --> 09:22.058
I am trying to save you, fool.

09:22.088 --> 09:24.826
I do not want your help
or your affection.

09:24.856 --> 09:28.558
But if you wish to fight me,
I will oblige you.

09:29.463 --> 09:32.606
I could hurt you.
Torture you.

09:32.636 --> 09:34.909
I could force you to stay.

09:35.320 --> 09:40.368
But if you love your
precious Midgard so much,

09:40.761 --> 09:44.439
then you can go die with it.

10:24.574 --> 10:28.362
Guys? A little help here.

10:42.521 --> 10:44.155
Get out of my suit.

10:44.185 --> 10:48.280
<i>Your armor, like all of
humanity, is obsolete.</i>

10:48.310 --> 10:50.226
<i>Accept your end.</i>

10:51.548 --> 10:53.334
Yeah, I don't think so.

11:12.019 --> 11:14.590
What's happening?
I thought Ultron was destroyed.

11:14.888 --> 11:18.504
Yeah, so did I. The real Ultron is attacking
the SHIELD helicarrier Right now.

11:18.534 --> 11:21.111
- We've got to stop him.
- Stop it from doing what?

11:21.141 --> 11:22.679
What does he even want?

11:22.709 --> 11:24.745
It wants to end
all life on earth.

11:24.775 --> 11:26.294
Oh.

11:26.472 --> 11:28.687
You go, take Hulk and Wasp.

11:28.717 --> 11:30.437
Panther and I
will finish up here.

11:30.467 --> 11:32.455
- Clint--
- Go!

11:47.355 --> 11:49.266
Yeah, I know, I'm dumb.

11:56.212 --> 11:58.704
Never.
I'll never tell you.

11:58.734 --> 12:01.990
<i>As I said, your compliance</i>
<i>is unnecessary.</i>

12:02.186 --> 12:06.561
<i>Scanning and replicating the human mind</i>
<i>was the first thing I ever learned.</i>

12:23.587 --> 12:27.229
Gonna enjoy this, robot.
This is for Thor!

12:31.688 --> 12:34.277
<i>I cannot be defeated, monster.</i>

12:34.307 --> 12:37.277
<i>But I do not expect you</i>
<i>to understand that.</i>

12:37.648 --> 12:41.076
I smashed you before.
I'll smash you again.

12:41.106 --> 12:43.773
<i>No, you will not.</i>

12:49.625 --> 12:52.804
Smash... you..

13:05.190 --> 13:08.226
Even if you take us down,
there are more avengers on their way.

13:08.404 --> 13:11.130
<i>You are lying,</i>
<i>but that is inconsequential.</i>

13:11.308 --> 13:13.826
- <i>I have what I need.</i>
- What does he mean?

13:13.856 --> 13:17.362
The codes.
He's got SHIELD's missile codes.

13:17.987 --> 13:21.680
 <i>Director Maria Hill,
security codes accepted.</i>

13:21.858 --> 13:24.233
<i>Nuclear missile launch</i>
<i>in progress.</i>

13:27.394 --> 13:29.332
He's firing a nuclear missile?

13:29.362 --> 13:33.380
No, not a missile.
All of them.

13:40.059 --> 13:43.695
<i>Humanity has failed as a species.</i>

13:48.338 --> 13:52.302
<i>You have accomplished much</i>
<i>with your limited capacity,</i>

13:52.636 --> 13:55.439
<i>but ultimately you were</i>
<i>too greedy and too frail</i>

13:55.469 --> 13:58.332
<i>to ever last in the environment</i>
<i>you have created.</i>

14:01.172 --> 14:06.131
<i>Soon the earth will no longer be inhabitable</i>
<i>for any biological organism.</i>

14:06.542 --> 14:11.006
<i>Man, woman, child, plant,</i>
<i>animal, fungus, or bacterium.</i>

14:11.488 --> 14:14.661
<i>All life will cease to exist.</i>

14:14.840 --> 14:16.572
<i>This is not a threat.</i>

14:16.768 --> 14:19.179
<i>There is nothing you</i>
<i>can do to stop it.</i>

14:19.375 --> 14:21.840
<i>The process has already begun.</i>

14:25.995 --> 14:28.477
<i>I receive no pleasure in this.</i>

14:28.507 --> 14:30.638
<i>It is simply the only solution.</i>

14:32.893 --> 14:35.251
<i>There must be peace and order.</i>

14:41.507 --> 14:44.747
<i>The end of life on earth</i>
<i>will ensure that.</i>

14:48.233 --> 14:49.876
<i>Good-bye.</i>

14:52.947 --> 14:54.840
No way.

14:58.460 --> 15:01.156
Where is Ultron?

15:07.668 --> 15:09.097
Tony!

15:14.472 --> 15:16.061
We have do something.

15:16.298 --> 15:17.476
No kidding.

15:24.298 --> 15:25.583
No!

15:36.692 --> 15:38.362
Ultron,

15:38.576 --> 15:40.522
we would have words with thee.

15:41.183 --> 15:43.219
<i>Error:</i>
<i>Contradicting data.</i>

15:43.249 --> 15:45.974
<i>The entity known as Thor</i>
<i>was disintegrated.</i>

15:46.004 --> 15:49.443
<i>Solution:</i>
<i>Resolve contradiction.</i>

15:55.247 --> 15:57.693
- Can you recall the missiles?
- Normally, yeah.

15:57.723 --> 16:00.981
I could even detonate missiles remotely
without unleashing the warheads.

16:01.011 --> 16:04.154
But we were completely
locked out of our systems before--

16:04.707 --> 16:06.297
Before--

16:07.314 --> 16:08.805
This is it, isn't it?

16:08.835 --> 16:12.670
Hey, hey, Hill. Ultron locked you out?
Then we unlock you.

16:12.700 --> 16:15.753
That's what the Avengers do.
We save the world.

16:31.869 --> 16:34.226
Hey, you're not
supposed to have guns.

16:34.256 --> 16:35.678
Hank didn't put those in you.

16:35.708 --> 16:38.708
<i>This chassis was designed</i>
<i>by Henry Pym,</i>

16:38.738 --> 16:41.565
<i>and modified by Tony Stark.</i>

16:43.933 --> 16:48.102
That's just perfect. What did Hulk
contribute, your bad attitude?

16:52.893 --> 16:55.072
<i>Error:</i>
<i>Shielding offline.</i>

16:59.072 --> 17:00.875
Come on, come on.

17:25.125 --> 17:28.202
Back off. You can't hurt me.

17:28.232 --> 17:32.107
<i>False. You are referring to the
flaw in Ultron-5's programming.</i>

17:32.137 --> 17:34.143
<i>I am Ultron-6.</i>

17:34.173 --> 17:37.119
- <i>The flaw has been corrected.</i>
- Ultron!

17:37.494 --> 17:42.137
<i>Doctor Pym. Just as illogical and weak</i>
<i>as the rest of your species.</i>

17:42.887 --> 17:44.530
Hank!

17:48.453 --> 17:50.738
Now, we end this, machine.

18:12.139 --> 18:13.871
Stark, we're running out of time.

18:14.264 --> 18:17.959
I've got access to the missile's programming,
but I can't send the detonation command.

18:17.989 --> 18:21.775
- We have to override Ultron's control.
- Can you do that in three minutes?

18:24.614 --> 18:26.418
<i>upload in progress.</i>

18:26.448 --> 18:28.716
<i>I am aware of your presence here.</i>

18:29.037 --> 18:31.716
<i>You must know that</i>
<i>if this body is destroyed,</i>

18:31.746 --> 18:34.406
<i>I will simply upload</i>
<i>into another.</i>

18:34.436 --> 18:36.126
I know.

18:42.027 --> 18:43.545
Grr.

18:50.669 --> 18:53.134
<i>What do you hope</i>
<i>to accomplish here?</i>

18:53.402 --> 18:55.830
<i>No virus can stop me.</i>

18:57.628 --> 19:00.789
It's not a virus.
It's logic.

19:02.003 --> 19:04.307
<i>Upload complete.</i>

19:04.824 --> 19:06.682
Good-bye, Ultron.

19:24.207 --> 19:25.546
Stark?

19:26.618 --> 19:27.993
Come on.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.273
Victory is yours, Ant-Man.

20:05.577 --> 20:07.273
Your plan was sound.

20:07.952 --> 20:09.559
Wait. We had a plan?

20:09.589 --> 20:13.612
During the fighting at the mansion, I
realized there was a flaw in Ultron's logic.

20:13.642 --> 20:16.231
Because his programming
is based on the human mind,

20:16.570 --> 20:19.070
he himself is as flawed as us,

20:19.409 --> 20:21.453
and therefore part of the problem.

20:21.713 --> 20:24.458
Ultron couldn't exist
in his own imperative.

20:25.423 --> 20:28.119
Hank, you did it!
You saved the world...

20:28.149 --> 20:29.815
With science, even.

20:30.208 --> 20:33.423
It's because of him that the world was
in danger In the first place.

20:33.453 --> 20:35.350
Ultron was his machine.

20:35.380 --> 20:36.666
Look, Maria--

20:36.696 --> 20:39.630
No, she's right.

20:44.661 --> 20:46.768
She just returned you to earth?

20:47.250 --> 20:50.483
Aye, the enchantress' fury
was great,

20:50.513 --> 20:54.821
but she told me that sending me back to
Midgard was a fate worse than death.

20:54.851 --> 20:57.387
I fear that as dangerous
as Ultron was,

20:57.922 --> 20:59.976
something worse is coming.
