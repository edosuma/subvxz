09:56.913 --> 09:58.338
I call it the Waylon.

09:58.490 --> 10:00.915
Like you,
it's sophisticated yet playful,

10:00.934 --> 10:02.992
as blue and sparkling
as your eyes.

10:03.011 --> 10:04.510
Okay, I've got to go.

10:04.587 --> 10:07.997
I'm helping a 13-year-old boy
come out to his parents.

10:08.166 --> 10:10.350
To Jacksonville!

Sorry I'm late, sir.

A-And sorry I wasn't available
this weekend.

10:23.773 --> 10:25.439
Or last weekend. I was...

10:25.459 --> 10:26.774
You were gone?
(chuckles)

10:26.793 --> 10:28.534
Who cares? I figured it out.

10:28.687 --> 10:30.462
These pieces are designed
to interlock.

10:30.689 --> 10:32.446
But to what purpose?

10:32.615 --> 10:33.857
Sir, it is a puzzle.

10:33.875 --> 10:35.191
Not for long, man.

10:35.284 --> 10:37.135
Monty Burns is on the case.

10:37.395 --> 10:41.723
The obvious first step is
to sort every piece by weight.

-Waylon!

10:47.205 --> 10:49.873
Marge? Why are you
in the executive parking lot?

10:49.891 --> 10:50.965
Who cares?

10:51.059 --> 10:53.376
Tell me
all about Michael de Graaf!

10:53.395 --> 10:56.546
(chuckles)
Well, Michael's kind of perfect.

10:56.564 --> 10:58.381

of Thin Mints.

11:01.720 --> 11:04.404
I mean, it's nice to finally be
in love with someone...

11:04.556 --> 11:05.163
good.

11:05.314 --> 11:06.998
I'm dying to meet him.

11:07.150 --> 11:10.059
What if we threw you two
a party?

11:10.078 --> 11:11.744
A party. That's what people do

11:11.897 --> 11:13.838
when they finally have
something worth celebrating.

11:13.990 --> 11:16.065
-Let's do it!
-Yes!

11:16.159 --> 11:18.902
This makes me part
of your couple origin story.

11:18.920 --> 11:19.903
I'm in!

11:19.921 --> 11:21.638
(low, upbeat music plays)

11:23.833 --> 11:25.742
Just what I always wanted
for him,

11:25.835 --> 11:27.835
a handsome
billionaire boyfriend.

11:27.929 --> 11:29.187
So happy.

11:29.414 --> 11:30.246
(grunts)

11:30.265 --> 11:31.839
Excuse me, Mr. de Graaf,

11:32.008 --> 11:34.417
we love your wicked zingers
on the show.

11:34.436 --> 11:35.360
Could you?

11:35.511 --> 11:36.361
My pleasure.

11:36.588 --> 11:38.438
Wow, it was so kind
of Estelle Getty

11:38.590 --> 11:41.348
to donate her wardrobe for
your production of<i> The Crucible.</i>

11:41.368 --> 11:42.275
(laughs)

11:42.427 --> 11:44.928
Hello and welcome
to Grey Gardens.

11:45.021 --> 11:46.854
At least
those ladies had a look.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.707
You have a "don't look."

11:48.934 --> 11:50.600
(laughing)

11:50.693 --> 11:51.543
Do you like my top?

11:51.770 --> 11:53.194
Yes, I love the shoulder pads.

11:53.362 --> 11:56.122
Is something I would have said
in the '90s but not about that.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.716
Do you like my top?

11:57.867 --> 11:59.968
Yes. He seems very nice.

12:01.037 --> 12:03.221
Is it wrong
to enjoy being envied?

12:03.372 --> 12:05.465
Because I am savoring it.

12:05.617 --> 12:07.967
When did you first realize
that Homer was the one,

12:08.136 --> 12:09.969
the great love of your life?

12:10.063 --> 12:12.546
Well, after he got me pregnant,

12:12.566 --> 12:15.567
I just knew he was someone
I was gonna have kids with.

12:15.794 --> 12:17.293
Aw. Mwah.

12:17.386 --> 12:19.887
Young lady, I like
your quirky fashion sense.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.148
That zigzag dress hem
is everything.

12:22.300 --> 12:25.134
Thanks, but I don't
really pay attention to fashion.

12:25.228 --> 12:28.137
It doesn't seem...
super important.

12:28.139 --> 12:30.564
I'd like to suggest
some alterations. May I?

12:30.584 --> 12:33.659
I mean, it's a waste
of your time, but fine.

12:33.812 --> 12:35.736
Wearing the same thing
every day is a choice,

12:35.756 --> 12:38.831
so I can free up my mind
to think about important things,

12:38.984 --> 12:40.908
rather than "Am I on trend?"

12:40.927 --> 12:42.927
Ha, whatever that means.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.837
You know who didn't care
about fashion?

12:44.931 --> 12:46.264
Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

12:46.491 --> 12:48.508
She slapped on a doily
and that was enough.

12:48.660 --> 12:51.677
This obsession with appearance
in our culture...

12:51.772 --> 12:52.845
Did you make me taller?

12:52.939 --> 12:54.347
I feel so confident.

12:54.516 --> 12:58.334
I don't even have a job, but
I'm going to ask for a raise.

12:58.353 --> 12:59.319
(grunts)

13:00.672 --> 13:02.447
A toast to our hosts.

13:02.598 --> 13:04.023
And to Marge's hair,

13:04.175 --> 13:06.433
which is avant-gorgeous.

13:06.528 --> 13:07.860
(chuckles):
Oh!

13:07.954 --> 13:09.621
And I want you to be
the first to hear--

13:09.772 --> 13:12.015
I've decided to manufacture
my new retail line

13:12.033 --> 13:13.533
right here in Springfield,

13:13.627 --> 13:16.853
in the factory that used
to make fidget spinners.

13:16.855 --> 13:18.371
Spin-ners!

13:18.465 --> 13:21.024
And if anyone needs a job,
there are applications

13:21.042 --> 13:24.710
right next to the best coleslaw
I've ever had.

Mamma, everyone is-a happy.

13:31.202 --> 13:34.312
Why are you so against
this-a love? Why?

13:34.463 --> 13:35.872
I hate...

13:35.965 --> 13:38.465
because I hate-a myself!

13:38.560 --> 13:41.210
I... I love-a the women.

13:41.212 --> 13:43.488
No, Mamma, you are beautiful.

13:43.715 --> 13:46.324
You love-a the women,
and I love-a the you.

13:46.475 --> 13:48.384

13:48.477 --> 13:52.738

of-a Gina Lollobrigida

13:52.833 --> 13:54.223

13:54.317 --> 13:56.317
(speaking Italian)

13:56.411 --> 13:59.128
Oh, oh, okay, okay, okay, Mamma!

14:00.398 --> 14:02.841
(gasps) Look,
it's Michael's new factory!

14:03.068 --> 14:04.325
So modern.

14:04.419 --> 14:05.585

14:05.737 --> 14:07.737
Yeah, do you know anybody
that works there?

14:07.830 --> 14:10.423
Ha, well, they hired
most of the desperate saps

14:10.517 --> 14:11.832
who've been unemployed forever.

14:12.001 --> 14:13.334
So, yeah,
I'm friends with all of 'em.

14:13.353 --> 14:16.521
This week's trend
is glitter on sunglasses.

14:16.672 --> 14:18.398
So we got right on it.

16:51.160 --> 16:53.919
I've proven conclusively
these pieces form...

16:54.072 --> 16:55.829
a secret image.

I can't believe
I'm asking<i> you</i> this,

Tell me about the lucky lady.

about nothing but profit.

Ooh, don't tell me,

17:37.465 --> 17:39.390
De Graaf's discovered
the secret.

17:39.542 --> 17:42.952
Fast fashion is far more toxic
than nuclear power.

do what's right for you.

19:34.323 --> 19:37.066
Come away with me and be adored.

19:37.084 --> 19:40.219
(sighs)
Adored would be a nice change.

19:44.258 --> 19:46.759
To seeing the best in each other

19:46.853 --> 19:48.835
and ignoring everything else.

19:48.855 --> 19:51.096
I'll drink to that.

19:51.249 --> 19:52.748
-(yaps)
-Ooh! Idiot!

19:52.767 --> 19:56.510
These pants are made of cashmere

Beautiful jet-setting

20:10.768 --> 20:12.543

20:12.695 --> 20:15.028
(sighs) It's gonna take
some time to get over Michael.

20:15.122 --> 20:17.739
But I did get one thing out
of the relationship.

20:18.776 --> 20:20.793
Someone to be there
when I come home,

20:20.945 --> 20:23.462
who will love me
unconditionally.

20:23.556 --> 20:24.705

 We go further, so you can.

The last piece. You will reveal
your secrets to me.

Good Lord! All this time,
it was a hot-air balloon!

20:56.481 --> 20:58.405
Yes, sir, just like the picture
on the box.

20:58.499 --> 21:01.166
There was a picture? Well, that
could have saved me months!

21:01.243 --> 21:03.168
Oh, well. Now I can get back

21:03.263 --> 21:05.337

Sir, before you do that,

21:07.249 --> 21:08.933
maybe you'd like to try
another puzzle?

21:09.084 --> 21:10.159
This one's a little harder.

21:10.252 --> 21:12.252
It's a hundred pieces, and, uh,

21:12.346 --> 21:14.013
two of the unicorns
look pretty similar.

21:14.165 --> 21:16.256
