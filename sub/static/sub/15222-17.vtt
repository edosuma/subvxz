00:01.668 --> 00:05.661
<i>Theorizing that one could time travel
within his own lifetime,</i>

00:05.739 --> 00:08.674
<i>Dr. Sam Beckett stepped
into the Quantum Leap accelerator...</i>

00:08.742 --> 00:10.733
<i>and vanished.</i>

00:15.015 --> 00:17.950
<i>He awoke to find himself
trapped in the past,</i>

00:18.018 --> 00:21.545
<i>facing mirror images
that were not his own...</i>

00:21.621 --> 00:26.854
<i>and driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.</i>

00:26.926 --> 00:30.862
<i>His only guide on this journey is Al,
an observer from his own time,</i>

00:30.930 --> 00:35.629
<i>who appears in the form of a hologram
that only Sam can see and hear.</i>

00:35.702 --> 00:39.866
<i>And so, Dr. Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,</i>

00:41.141 --> 00:43.871
<i>striving to put right
what once went wrong...</i>

00:43.943 --> 00:46.571
<i>and hoping each time
that his next leap...</i>

00:46.646 --> 00:48.739
<i>will be the leap home.</i>

00:56.423 --> 00:59.586
Alia? Alia!

00:59.659 --> 01:01.889
Sam? Sam!

01:01.961 --> 01:05.191
It's all right. It's all right.
I'm right here.

01:05.265 --> 01:07.290
- Where?
- I don't know.

01:07.367 --> 01:11.497
<i>Good lord.! Only a week in the box,
and you don't know where you are.</i>

01:11.571 --> 01:13.664
Sam!

01:14.941 --> 01:17.637
Sam.

01:17.710 --> 01:20.406
Sam?

01:20.480 --> 01:25.417
If you're yellin' for a three-letter savior,
I suggest you make it start with a "G."

01:29.355 --> 01:31.414
I have to get out of here.

01:31.491 --> 01:33.891
Well, that's simple.

01:33.960 --> 01:36.986
All you have to do is tell me
which one of you two did it.

01:37.063 --> 01:40.829
Did what?

01:40.900 --> 01:44.392
First you act like you don't know where you
are, then you pretend you don't know why.

01:44.471 --> 01:47.702
- We don't!
- Oh, you don't?

01:47.774 --> 01:51.141
Well, you'd better figure it out,
or you're going back in that box.

01:51.211 --> 01:55.875
Now, ladies, which one of you
murdered Carol Benning?

01:59.219 --> 02:01.210
Oh, boy.

<i>Gate, do you copy?
Copy. Gate Clear.</i>

03:20.333 --> 03:22.699
<i>We had leaped together and survived,</i>

03:22.769 --> 03:27.672
<i>but we still didn't know if Alia had
leaped with me or I had leaped with her.</i>

03:27.740 --> 03:31.301
<i>And being in a women's prison didn't
make finding the answer to that any easier.</i>

03:33.980 --> 03:37.006
Would you please tell me
where you're taking us?

03:44.791 --> 03:47.726
Are you racist or somethin'?
Aw, shut up and come on.

03:47.794 --> 03:50.456
Why do you always
- Just shut up! Come on!

03:50.530 --> 03:53.055
<i>Where are you taking us?
Keep moving, missy.</i>

03:55.468 --> 03:57.629
Saunders?
Thanks.

04:03.209 --> 04:05.404
Sit.

04:09.415 --> 04:12.350
Just take it easy.
We'll figure this out, okay?

04:12.418 --> 04:14.477
Nobody told you to talk.

04:14.554 --> 04:17.216
I told you to sit.

04:17.290 --> 04:19.416
I need to talk to her.

04:19.492 --> 04:23.986
You got no needs, you got
no wants, you got no rights.

04:25.498 --> 04:29.332
If you want answers,
I suggest you let me talk to her.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.599
Now, why should I do
you any favors?

04:35.341 --> 04:38.538
If I find out the truth,
who's doin' who the favor?

04:44.617 --> 04:46.608
Alone.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.615
Step into my office.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.533
Warden's got plans for you, Angel.

05:02.602 --> 05:04.593
Big plans.

05:05.705 --> 05:08.401
Lothos put us here.
Shh.

05:08.474 --> 05:11.136
Just be quiet and listen to me.
He knows where I am.

05:11.210 --> 05:14.145
We don't know that. There's a
50%50 chance this could be my leap.

05:14.213 --> 05:17.148
Even if it is, when he locates
me, Sam, he's going to kill me.

05:17.216 --> 05:19.150
Yeah, but he's gotta
locate you first, right?

05:19.218 --> 05:22.153
Now, look, right now
you're alive and you're safe.

05:22.221 --> 05:24.815
How long does it take Zoey to do a
location search? Uh, I don't know.

05:24.891 --> 05:28.793
It differs. Sometimes just a couple of hours, but
once or twice I haven't had contact for an entire day.

05:28.861 --> 05:31.796
Okay, we just gotta find some way to
hide you, that's all. Sam, you did it.

05:31.864 --> 05:34.799
From myself? Zoey's locked into my
brain waves. She leaped with you.

05:34.867 --> 05:36.801
Look, Al-
Al is here?

05:36.869 --> 05:39.736
And there's two women in the waiting
room. Yes, he's here. That's great, okay?

05:39.806 --> 05:41.740
Then we'll change
your brain waves. Okay?

05:41.808 --> 05:44.868
We gotta find a way to alter her brain
patterns before Lothos can get a lock on her.

05:44.944 --> 05:46.878
How? What the hell
are you talkin' about?

05:46.946 --> 05:49.380
Drugs? Alcohol? Some kind of
self-induced coma? I don't think so.

05:49.449 --> 05:51.883
That would leave you too vulnerable.
Oh, Ziggy's got something here.

05:51.951 --> 05:53.885
You can't reprogram
my brain. Hip- Hip-

05:53.953 --> 05:55.887
Hip what?
Hip-

05:55.955 --> 05:57.889
No.

05:57.957 --> 05:59.891
Hip what? Oh, hypnosis.
Hypnosis. Try hypnosis.

05:59.959 --> 06:02.393
You can't hypnotize me.
You know, that could work.

06:02.462 --> 06:04.396
Wait a second.
It might work.

06:04.464 --> 06:07.399
You remember that leap when you leaped in
the insane asylum and you lost your memory?

06:07.467 --> 06:10.402
There was this leap where I lost my
memory. It altered your brain waves.

06:10.470 --> 06:13.906
It must've altered my brain waves. You kept
goin' from one personality to another personality.

06:13.973 --> 06:16.908
I was goin' from one personality to another
personality. And you lost connection with me.

06:16.976 --> 06:19.410
Right? A-A-And we were losing
contact. So hypnosis could, you know-

06:19.479 --> 06:22.414
He was losing contact with me, and
maybe hypnosis could do the same thing.

06:22.482 --> 06:25.918
All right? You gotta let me try it, okay?
I think it's the only way to hide you.

06:25.985 --> 06:28.920
Oh, Sam, I just want to be
free. You're free right now.

06:28.988 --> 06:31.115
Let me try
and keep you that way.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.059
What do I do?

06:34.127 --> 06:36.561
Just relax and close your eyes.

06:36.629 --> 06:38.756
<i>And she should think of nothin;</i>

06:38.831 --> 06:41.800
<i>She's gotta shut her eyes.
Close your eyes.</i>

06:41.868 --> 06:43.802
<i>And relax.
Relax.</i>

06:43.870 --> 06:46.964
<i>Completely. Take a deep
breath. Take a deep breath.</i>

06:47.039 --> 06:49.439
And let it out slow.
And forget everything.

06:49.509 --> 06:51.443
Forget everything.

06:51.511 --> 06:53.445
Her- Her past, her anger-
Your past,

06:53.513 --> 06:55.674
her fear.
Your anger and fear.

06:55.748 --> 06:58.683
Yeah. Now, she's gotta imagine
she's on the top of a mountain.

06:58.751 --> 07:01.686
I want you to imagine
you're on a mountaintop.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.688
Lookin' out, you know?

07:03.756 --> 07:06.691
You're standing on the top
of a mountain, looking out.

07:06.759 --> 07:09.091
Can you see yourself
there? Mm-hmm.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.096
All right.

07:11.164 --> 07:14.565
You're looking up
at a yellow sun...

07:16.636 --> 07:19.571
In the middle of
a dark, dark blue sky.

07:21.641 --> 07:26.476
A warm summer breeze
blows across your face.

07:27.747 --> 07:32.616
<i>White clouds streak
across the dark blue sky.</i>

07:32.685 --> 07:35.119
<i>What do you see there?</i>

07:35.188 --> 07:37.281
<i>Only clouds.</i>

07:37.356 --> 07:40.018
<i>White clouds.
Yes.</i>

07:40.092 --> 07:42.583
<i>And miles and miles of sky.</i>

07:42.662 --> 07:44.596
<i>That's good.</i>

07:44.664 --> 07:48.031
<i>It's almost as if I'm-
Dark blue sky. Clouds.</i>

07:48.100 --> 07:50.364
Al?

07:50.436 --> 07:52.370
Clouds.

07:52.438 --> 07:54.372
Al, where are you?

07:54.440 --> 07:56.431
Vegas.

07:58.244 --> 08:00.405
Al!

08:00.480 --> 08:04.439
Oh, uh,
Mallard Correctional Facility.

08:04.517 --> 08:07.748
I'm frightened, Sam.
I don't know where I am.

08:07.820 --> 08:11.483
You're in a broom closet. You're in the
Mallard Correctional Facility for Women.

08:11.557 --> 08:14.390
Mallard, Ohio,
September 16, 1987.

08:14.460 --> 08:17.554
Your name is Jenson.
AngelJenson.

08:17.630 --> 08:20.064
Angela Jenson.
Uh, nickname-Angel.

08:20.132 --> 08:22.566
Nineteen years old, arrested for
selling pot. You're 19 years old.

08:22.635 --> 08:25.365
And it was an election year.
They threw the book at her.

08:27.473 --> 08:29.532
Hmm? Oh.

08:29.609 --> 08:35.138
Uh, well, one of the two women in the waiting room says her name is Liz
- Elizabeth Tate.

08:35.214 --> 08:38.149
She's in for murder.
The other one is in a state of shock.

08:38.217 --> 08:40.947
My name is Liz.
Liz Tate.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.953
Yeah.
Can you remember that, Angel?

08:43.022 --> 08:48.619
And Liz, uh, says that after her husband
beat her the 15th time, she shot him.

08:51.097 --> 08:54.032
That's not murder.
That's self-defense.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.034
That's not what the jury said.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.313
<i>Liz?</i>

09:08.381 --> 09:11.714
I'm right here.
Yeah?

09:11.784 --> 09:13.718
Someone's coming.
Huh?

09:13.786 --> 09:16.380
Someone's coming in the
distance. I can see s-

09:16.455 --> 09:19.390
<i>What the hell is she talkin'about?
Who's coming?</i>

09:19.458 --> 09:23.394
<i>I don't know.
She's looking for something.</i>

09:23.462 --> 09:25.453
I'm afraid, Liz.

09:28.467 --> 09:31.732
Your name is AngelJenson.

09:31.804 --> 09:36.639
You only know
what AngelJenson knows.

09:36.709 --> 09:40.440
I hope she can protect herself, because at best
she's only got a little bit of Angel's memory.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.504
Well, let's hope it's enough.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.683
All right.

09:45.751 --> 09:48.185
I want you to find Angel.

09:48.254 --> 09:53.157
Her pain, her hope, her past.

09:53.225 --> 09:55.625
Every little piece of her
that's left.

09:55.695 --> 09:58.755
<i>That's all you are now.</i>

09:58.831 --> 10:01.527
You are Angel.
Do you understand?

10:01.601 --> 10:03.296
Uh-huh.

10:03.369 --> 10:06.964
<i>All right, Angel. Good.</i>

10:07.039 --> 10:12.944
Now I'm gonna count to three,
and when I do, you're gonna open your eyes.

10:13.012 --> 10:14.946
No, w-w-wait a minute.

10:15.014 --> 10:17.812
Isn't there supposed to be
a special password or somethin'...

10:17.883 --> 10:20.113
<i>to get her back to Alia
when you want?</i>

10:20.186 --> 10:24.213
All right. You will remain AngelJenson...

10:24.290 --> 10:26.281
until I say the word-

10:26.359 --> 10:28.953
- Rumpelstiltskin.
- Rumpelstiltskin?

10:29.028 --> 10:31.223
- Rumpelstiltskin.
- Ha-

10:31.297 --> 10:36.291
- Well, it worked for him.
- All right. Rumpelstiltskin it is.

10:37.803 --> 10:40.897
- What's your name?
- AngelJenson.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.635
Good.
All right, Angel.

10:43.709 --> 10:47.338
When I count to three,
you will wake up.

10:47.413 --> 10:50.473
You will remember
everything I told you.

10:53.386 --> 10:55.718
<i>One,</i>

10:55.788 --> 10:57.380
two,

10:57.456 --> 10:59.151
three.

10:59.225 --> 11:03.559
All right. Teatime's over.

11:03.629 --> 11:06.621
Get out here!

11:08.567 --> 11:10.501
Mm-hmm.

11:10.569 --> 11:13.402
He's off the phone.
You first.

11:14.907 --> 11:16.841
<i>Jenson and Tate.
Sit.</i>

11:16.909 --> 11:19.036
<i>I'll call you
when it's over with.</i>

11:19.111 --> 11:22.239
<i>Come in.</i>

11:24.016 --> 11:26.507
<i>Are they ready to talk?
Angel's ready to crack.</i>

11:26.585 --> 11:29.110
But Tate-
Oh-ho, she's tough.

11:29.188 --> 11:31.122
<i>She's a survivor.</i>

11:31.190 --> 11:35.126
Besides, three years in the state
penitentiary has that effect on people.

11:35.194 --> 11:37.287
<i>Makes 'em mean.</i>

11:37.363 --> 11:40.560
Hard.
Just how I like 'em.

11:40.633 --> 11:44.797
Why don't you put the thumbscrews to
'em, huh? Make 'em squirm a little.

11:44.870 --> 11:48.704
Always amazes me when you put the fear
of Meyers in 'em how quick they fold.

11:48.774 --> 11:53.040
Let's make sure one of'em hangs.
Make everybody happy.

11:57.216 --> 12:00.276
- How long you been in here, Tate?
- Three years on a life sentence.

12:00.352 --> 12:02.445
Uh, three years.

12:02.521 --> 12:04.887
Then you should have known enough
not to mess with Benning.

12:04.957 --> 12:08.552
Benning. Oh, uh, Ziggy
says there's a 73% chance-

12:08.627 --> 12:11.755
I understand. You're here to see Elizabeth
Tate doesn't get executed for the murder...

12:11.831 --> 12:13.492
<i>of a fellow inmate, Carol Benning.</i>

12:13.566 --> 12:17.468
But I can't help you.
Not this time.

12:17.536 --> 12:21.404
- Carol told you the truth.
- Told me what?

12:23.309 --> 12:25.243
I can't remember.

12:25.311 --> 12:28.337
Well, if you didn't do it,
tell 'em who did and walk away.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.814
Don't let 'em
put you back in there.

12:30.883 --> 12:32.578
Just don't say anything, Angel.

12:35.921 --> 12:38.788
Well, come on, ladies.
It's showtime.

12:38.858 --> 12:42.157
I'm gonna go back and see if I can
get more out of Ziggy. Watch her.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.453
Well?

13:19.999 --> 13:21.990
Well, what?

13:25.437 --> 13:27.371
Oh, don't get smart.

13:27.439 --> 13:31.375
Smart-mouthed people bore me.
And when I get bored, I get angry.

13:31.443 --> 13:36.142
And trust me,
you don't want to make me angry.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.815
I'm waiting.

13:48.194 --> 13:50.185
I can't remember anything.

13:51.297 --> 13:55.631
She's confused
from all the time in isolation.

13:55.701 --> 14:00.365
I mean, she-We just need
a little more time, that's all.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.776
You haven't answered my question.

14:08.814 --> 14:11.408
Hey. H-H-H-Hey!
They can't even hear me!

14:11.483 --> 14:14.509
Oh, I am gonna love this!

14:16.055 --> 14:20.924
Since she's drawn a blank,
why don't you tell me why we're all here.

14:20.993 --> 14:24.429
My, my, my, did we Swiss cheese
a little on our first leap?

14:24.496 --> 14:26.726
Look, we didn't kill
Carol Benning.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.733
Ooh. Murder.

14:28.801 --> 14:31.201
<i>You gotta believe that.
Let's see.</i>

14:31.270 --> 14:33.568
Now, you are
Clifton Meyers, age 55.

14:35.407 --> 14:37.534
<i>Really?
Mm-hmm.</i>

14:37.610 --> 14:40.943
Principal Warden at the Mallard Women's
Correctional Facility in Mallard, Ohio.

14:41.013 --> 14:43.641
Then who did?

14:44.650 --> 14:46.550
I don't know.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.587
Ah. Ooh!

14:48.654 --> 14:50.451
Neither one of us knows.

14:50.522 --> 14:52.820
You're not making this easy.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.383
<i>September 16, 1987.
Look, Warden, I'm-</i>

14:55.461 --> 14:59.989
Which pinpoints our last trace before
we lost contact with the fair Alia.

15:00.065 --> 15:04.525
Lothos says there's a 79.9% chance that when
she leaped here, so did the good doctor Beckett.

15:04.603 --> 15:07.163
Which means, find Sam, find Alia.

15:07.239 --> 15:10.106
<i>Look, if we knew anything,
we'd tell you.</i>

15:10.175 --> 15:13.804
Just find out what wrong Sam Beckett
is here to right, and the rest is history.

15:13.879 --> 15:15.972
I need someone in here.

15:20.753 --> 15:24.314
<i>Our guests here say they, uh,
don't seem to know anything.</i>

15:24.390 --> 15:26.483
That's a crock.

15:26.558 --> 15:31.052
Fiddler was cleanin' the toilets when
Liz and Angel dragged Carol in there.

15:31.130 --> 15:34.827
Now, Fiddler couldn't hear what they were sayin' 'cause
that little accident last spring blew out her ears,

15:34.900 --> 15:37.198
<i>but she saw Carol all bent over.</i>

15:37.269 --> 15:41.035
<i>Next thing she knew, these two ran out and left
her there, dead on the floor in a pool ofblood.</i>

15:41.106 --> 15:44.507
Hmm. Carol Benning, age 28.
In for possession and robbery.

15:44.576 --> 15:47.875
<i>Autopsy says she was stabbed.
That's right.</i>

15:47.947 --> 15:50.507
- Which one of you did it?
- We didn't.

15:50.582 --> 15:54.985
- So Fiddler's a liar?
- When in trouble, deny, baby, deny, deny.

15:55.054 --> 15:56.988
I want to talk to Fiddler.

16:02.628 --> 16:05.825
My friends here
aren't being very cooperative.

16:05.898 --> 16:08.833
Maybe I pulled 'em
out of the cooler too soon.

16:08.901 --> 16:12.735
Maybe you did. Perhaps you
better escort them back.

16:12.805 --> 16:16.798
I'm sure a few more days in isolation
will make them remember.

16:16.875 --> 16:20.367
- L-I don't want to go back in there.
- This one's got a case of the shakes.

16:20.446 --> 16:24.405
She's got a bad case of claustrophobia. Practically
had to knock her out to get her in there.

16:24.483 --> 16:27.418
No, I- I can't go back in there.
No! No!

16:27.486 --> 16:29.545
It's all right.
Listen, Warden.

16:29.621 --> 16:34.024
<i>Warden, listen, if you make us go back
into a small, dark space like that again-</i>

16:36.095 --> 16:38.655
Thinkin' about somethin'
we don't know anything about,

16:38.731 --> 16:41.063
<i>it's not gonna do
either one of us any good.</i>

16:41.133 --> 16:44.864
But if you let us
go back into the cell,

16:44.937 --> 16:48.395
<i>we can be with the other inmates, and
maybe we can find out what happened.</i>

16:48.474 --> 16:50.874
Why should I?

16:50.943 --> 16:54.879
Because if you put us back in that box,
we won't be able to find out anything,

16:54.947 --> 16:59.179
and then Angel and I
will end up taking the rap.

16:59.251 --> 17:01.776
The rap?

17:01.854 --> 17:03.788
How perfectly '40s.

17:03.856 --> 17:07.416
<i>Liz is right. You're not gonna
get anybody to, uh, to-</i>

17:07.492 --> 17:10.428
Because nobody wants to rat to the warden?

17:10.496 --> 17:12.521
Exactly.
But they might talk to us.

17:17.136 --> 17:21.128
You go back to "C" block,
and you go back in the box.

17:21.205 --> 17:23.106
No!

17:23.175 --> 17:26.109
<i>- Take Angel back to the cooler.
- No.!</i>

17:26.178 --> 17:29.443
<i>Come on, Angel.
No! No!</i>

17:29.515 --> 17:32.109
<i>No, you don't understand.!
I'm claustrophobic.!</i>

17:32.184 --> 17:36.120
I know you are. Now listen. Now,
just breathe. No! No, I won't!

17:36.188 --> 17:39.055
You just go to the mountain. Go to the
mountain. You hear me? All right. Calm down.

17:39.124 --> 17:42.958
I'll be there as soon as I can. Wait for me
on the mountain. Come on. You know the routine.

17:43.028 --> 17:46.122
<i>Come on.!</i>

17:46.198 --> 17:48.962
Come on! Come on!
Don't take all day.

17:53.539 --> 17:58.169
What did you mean,
"Wait for me on the mountain," Liz?

17:58.243 --> 18:00.234
It's a dream we have.

18:02.147 --> 18:05.310
You've got 24 hours
to find out who killed Carol,

18:05.384 --> 18:07.648
or the murder report will read,

18:07.719 --> 18:10.313
"Stabbed by Elizabeth Tate
and AngelJenson. "

18:10.389 --> 18:14.450
- I'll need access to all the other inmates.
- You can have whatever you want.

18:14.526 --> 18:16.517
<i>Just do it fast.</i>

18:17.663 --> 18:20.860
Take her back to "C" block.

18:25.938 --> 18:30.432
Yo-ho! Yo-ho!

18:30.509 --> 18:33.945
<i>A hologram's life for me.!</i>

18:34.012 --> 18:37.607
Oh, it's bloody brilliant,
this machine! Don't you think?

18:37.683 --> 18:41.278
Just tell Lothos to get me all the data
on every inmate in here.

18:41.353 --> 18:43.685
My, my, my,
aren't we the testy one?

18:43.755 --> 18:47.282
Stop playing with me, Thames.

18:47.359 --> 18:49.884
I want Alia,

18:49.962 --> 18:54.228
and I don't want anything to happen to her
before I get a chance to rip her head off.

18:55.767 --> 18:58.702
Well, all we know is that
she leaped into this prison.

18:58.770 --> 19:02.797
We were just getting a lock on her brain waves,
and then all of a sudden she just vanished.

19:02.875 --> 19:06.709
How could she vanish? She's
connected to my neurons and my mesons.

19:06.778 --> 19:08.712
Well, we don't know.

19:08.780 --> 19:11.544
Lothos calculates that maybe
once you Quantum Leaped,

19:11.617 --> 19:14.882
somehow you
affected the transmission.

19:14.953 --> 19:16.887
Then reconfigure.
We did that.

19:16.955 --> 19:19.185
And?
And so far, zero for zero.

19:19.258 --> 19:21.283
Oh, damn!

19:22.728 --> 19:26.220
I want you to go back there and talk to
whoever leapt into the holding chamber.

19:26.298 --> 19:29.859
Oh, more bad news, dear.
There's nobody in the holding chamber.

19:29.935 --> 19:34.702
- That's impossible.
- When dealing with Quanta, nothing's impossible.

19:36.708 --> 19:40.200
Then run a trace on the last nanosecond
before you lost her.

19:40.279 --> 19:43.407
Rerun the leap a million times,
but get me a lock on Alia.

19:43.482 --> 19:46.280
Oh, Zoey, sweetheart.
I mean, come on.

19:46.351 --> 19:49.878
You know, after all,
this is my first day as a hologram.

19:49.955 --> 19:52.253
Now, Thames.

19:52.324 --> 19:55.589
Or have you forgotten
that I am here on borrowed time?

19:55.661 --> 19:58.562
You are here until you finish
what you are supposed to do.

19:59.698 --> 20:04.032
I have a 48-hour window
after my first leap to get home.

20:04.102 --> 20:07.970
After that, with every leap
the percentage drops.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.601
Now, get back there
and do what I told you to.

20:23.021 --> 20:24.955
Hmm.

20:25.023 --> 20:30.017
Perhaps for the sake of science,
I should see how the other half lives.

20:47.179 --> 20:51.115
<i>I've been leaping long enough to know
that when you cross minds with a phobic,</i>

20:51.183 --> 20:54.550
<i>whatever fears they have
now belong to you.</i>

20:54.620 --> 20:58.556
<i>Alia was holding for the moment,
but I had to ask myself...</i>

20:58.624 --> 21:00.558
<i>how long?</i>

21:00.626 --> 21:05.620
<i>How long before what was left of Angel
cracked and Lothos could lock onto Alia?</i>

21:05.697 --> 21:08.825
<i>We got problems, Sam.</i>

21:08.900 --> 21:12.301
Get this.
Ziggy says there's another leaper.

21:13.372 --> 21:15.272
Well, she's just picking up Alia.

21:15.340 --> 21:17.171
No, she already counted her.

21:18.744 --> 21:21.679
You don't think
they sent another leaper, do you?

21:21.747 --> 21:23.681
I don't know.

21:23.749 --> 21:29.016
Ziggy says that you gotta make sure you discover them before
they discover you, and certainly before they discover her.

21:29.087 --> 21:32.523
Did you check on Alia? Yeah, yeah.
She's not doing very well, Sam.

21:32.591 --> 21:35.719
She's rockin' back and forth,
and she keeps sayin', "It wasn't me. "

21:35.794 --> 21:38.854
What wasn't her? I don't know.
It doesn't make any sense.

21:38.930 --> 21:41.524
She just keeps sayin',
"It wasn't me. "

21:41.600 --> 21:43.500
You think it's Alia talking?

21:43.568 --> 21:49.029
I don't think so, because if it was, that
computer, that Lothos, would zero right in on her.

21:49.107 --> 21:51.041
Must be residuals from Angel.

21:51.109 --> 21:55.375
- Residual what?
- Memories. Residual memories.

21:55.447 --> 21:58.041
How's Angel?

21:58.116 --> 22:00.812
<i>I didn't mean to get you in trouble.</i>

22:01.887 --> 22:06.051
They said, "Fiddler, what did you see?"
And I told 'em. I told 'em.

22:06.124 --> 22:08.558
What, uh, happened?

22:08.627 --> 22:12.427
Well, you and Angel come in,
and you was fightin' about somethin'.

22:12.497 --> 22:14.431
But I couldn't hear what though.

22:14.499 --> 22:16.865
- Then what?
- Here's something, Sam.

22:16.935 --> 22:18.869
<i>Uh, this is, uh, Fedelia Jimmerson.</i>

22:18.937 --> 22:20.871
Uh, then Carol come in,

22:20.939 --> 22:24.067
and she was...
cryin' and all upset,

22:24.142 --> 22:28.442
<i>and, uh, there was blood on her,
and she was holdin'herself.</i>

22:28.513 --> 22:30.845
Uh, she was arrested in '81
for kidnapping.

22:30.916 --> 22:34.352
She was real scared.
But like I said, I didn't hear nothing.

22:34.419 --> 22:36.182
What was she afraid of, Fiddler?

22:36.254 --> 22:38.916
<i>But it turned out to be a case of
mistaken identity. I don't know.</i>

22:38.990 --> 22:41.720
- She was released this year.
- She was real scared.

22:41.793 --> 22:45.251
Yeah, well, Sophie's telling
a completely different version of the story.

22:45.330 --> 22:47.264
Well, this is a little weird, Sam.

22:47.332 --> 22:50.859
After she was released, she disappeared
completely. Ziggy says there's no trace of her.

22:50.936 --> 22:54.133
Looked to me like
she was beggin' you to help her.

22:54.206 --> 22:57.903
She was begging Liz?
Uh, she was begging me?

22:57.976 --> 22:59.910
Yeah.

22:59.978 --> 23:04.415
Then Angel went to get some towels,
and, uh, that's when, uh,

23:04.483 --> 23:07.577
Miss Sophie and her gang come in,

23:07.652 --> 23:09.984
and, uh, Carol fell over dead-

23:10.055 --> 23:11.545
<i>Just like that.</i>

23:11.623 --> 23:14.558
She was white as a sheet,

23:14.626 --> 23:17.356
and there was blood all over the floor,

23:17.429 --> 23:19.693
and I just finished cleaning it.

23:19.765 --> 23:22.461
<i>Ain't this sweet?</i>

23:24.336 --> 23:26.395
Kind of a family reunion, ain't it?

23:26.471 --> 23:29.133
What's the blue meanie after?

23:29.207 --> 23:31.437
Thought I had 24 hours.

23:31.510 --> 23:34.343
Actually, you only got 16.

23:34.413 --> 23:37.314
Time flies
when you're havin' fun, huh?

23:37.382 --> 23:39.316
Take a walk.

23:39.384 --> 23:42.182
<i>What is she,
some refugee out of a "B"movie?</i>

23:42.254 --> 23:45.223
- What do you want?
- I don't want nothin'.

23:46.224 --> 23:50.820
But the warden wants you
to come talk to him in his room.

23:50.896 --> 23:54.889
I'll pick you up in 10 minutes,
just in case you want to, uh,

23:54.966 --> 23:57.400
freshen up.

23:59.671 --> 24:02.037
<i>Uh-oh.
What?</i>

24:02.107 --> 24:05.543
Well, history's changing, Sam.

24:05.610 --> 24:08.807
Now Liz dies,
but Angel dies too.

24:55.894 --> 24:58.158
All those years.

25:00.632 --> 25:03.624
All the things we went through.

25:05.570 --> 25:07.697
Betrayed.

25:07.772 --> 25:10.707
<i>She's a coward.</i>

25:10.775 --> 25:15.075
<i>You yourself said
she didn't have the instinct.</i>

25:16.381 --> 25:18.941
I taught her, Thames.

25:20.418 --> 25:22.352
Every nuance,

25:22.420 --> 25:24.684
every twist,

25:24.756 --> 25:27.987
every wonderfully deceitful lie.

25:29.928 --> 25:32.089
She was brilliant.

25:33.098 --> 25:37.558
"Mistake," I believe,
was the adjective Lothos used.

25:38.637 --> 25:42.835
You know, I once remember
when we were in a deep input session,

25:42.908 --> 25:46.275
and he said he regretted
ever sending her.

25:46.344 --> 25:48.278
It was my fault.

25:48.346 --> 25:50.280
I insisted on it.

25:50.348 --> 25:53.374
It's so unlike you
to go against Lothos.

25:54.452 --> 25:57.216
Let's just say I owed her.

25:57.289 --> 26:00.952
Well, she should have been terminated
years ago. The pleasure's now mine.

26:01.026 --> 26:03.085
All systems are on full power.

26:03.161 --> 26:06.096
It's only a matter of time.

26:06.164 --> 26:10.430
Unless, of course,
she finds you first.

26:14.706 --> 26:17.766
You just make sure that doesn't happen.

26:19.477 --> 26:21.468
Come on, Liz.

26:23.481 --> 26:27.918
If Sophie catches me doin' this, I'm dead meat. But
you gotta talk to Angel. She is screamin' her head off.

26:27.986 --> 26:30.420
I don't think she can make it
through the night.

26:30.488 --> 26:32.922
And she was doin' fine-
fine-

26:32.991 --> 26:35.425
till they put her in four point.

26:35.493 --> 26:37.427
Four point?
She's on the wall.

26:37.495 --> 26:39.429
Come on.

26:41.266 --> 26:43.632
You know, Thames,

26:43.702 --> 26:47.900
this is the perfect place for revenge.

26:49.474 --> 26:55.140
Other than a 12th-century torture
chamber with iron maidens and a few racks,

26:55.213 --> 26:58.478
uh, it runs a close second.

26:58.550 --> 27:00.984
But, you know,

27:01.052 --> 27:06.422
I wouldn't put it past you to call Torture
Chambers-R-Us and ask for an immediate installation.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.783
She's here.

27:11.062 --> 27:12.996
I can feel it.

27:13.064 --> 27:15.999
Lothos has run a thousand scenarios.
There's a 92.9% chance-

27:16.067 --> 27:19.002
I don't want to know about
scenarios. I want her.

27:19.070 --> 27:22.631
Patience, patience,
patience, patience.

27:24.275 --> 27:29.611
Whatever device she is using to
cloak under has got to wear down.

27:31.116 --> 27:33.550
Maybe when she's asleep.

27:33.618 --> 27:39.284
And at that point, it's simply a matter
of pinpointing the subconscious mind.

27:44.929 --> 27:47.591
This is your destiny, Zoey.

27:49.934 --> 27:53.597
You have always been the one
he's wanted to carry out his plan.

27:56.074 --> 27:58.065
It's just a matter of timing.

28:00.445 --> 28:02.879
Isn't it?

28:02.947 --> 28:06.439
<i>Help me.! Somebody, please.!
I didn't do it.!</i>

28:06.518 --> 28:08.452
Open the door.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.454
Masterson, open the door.

28:10.522 --> 28:13.787
Can't do that. What do you mean?
Don't you hear her? Open the damn door!

28:13.858 --> 28:16.554
<i>I hear her just fine.
Open the door, Masterson.</i>

28:16.628 --> 28:18.425
<i>I'll take the responsibility.</i>

28:18.496 --> 28:21.056
Responsibility for what?
Getting my ass fired?

28:21.132 --> 28:24.260
If Meyers knows I let you in there,
he'll tear me a new face.

28:24.335 --> 28:27.566
Open the damn door!
You hear me? Open it!

28:29.641 --> 28:31.575
Get the keys.

28:31.643 --> 28:33.577
<i>Come on!</i>

28:35.647 --> 28:39.913
Easy. Easy. It's okay. It's all right.
It's me. It's me. It's me.

28:39.984 --> 28:42.248
It's all right. It's okay.

28:42.320 --> 28:45.483
It's all right. It's all right.
Here we go.

28:47.792 --> 28:49.783
There we go.

28:51.696 --> 28:54.597
Okay.
It's okay.

28:54.666 --> 28:56.600
All right, all right.
It's okay.

28:56.668 --> 28:58.659
<i>I'm not taking
responsibility for this.</i>

28:58.737 --> 29:01.706
<i>You hear me, Vivian?
Oh, shut up.! Just shut up.!</i>

29:01.773 --> 29:06.107
<i>As far as I'm concerned, they can lock
your asses away. I'll take care of Meyers.</i>

29:06.177 --> 29:08.111
<i>I'm not taking responsibility.!</i>

29:08.179 --> 29:11.012
<i>Look, it's on me.</i>

29:11.082 --> 29:13.016
<i>Yeah.
You're damned straight.</i>

29:13.084 --> 29:16.645
<i>Please don't make me go back.</i>

29:17.756 --> 29:22.056
<i>Please. I'll be good.
Please.</i>

29:23.061 --> 29:28.089
<i>Uh, Liz, it's not gonna do anybody
any good if you shut down.</i>

29:28.166 --> 29:30.100
<i>In fact, the truth of the matter is,</i>

29:30.168 --> 29:34.696
the more information you can give me,
the sooner you'll get outta here.

29:34.773 --> 29:39.039
<i>I still don't know where "here"is.</i>

29:39.110 --> 29:42.238
And maybe, just maybe,

29:42.313 --> 29:46.147
being here is a hell of a lot better
than being where I was.

29:46.217 --> 29:50.654
Uh, well, like I said,
we call this the waiting room.

29:50.722 --> 29:53.623
The waiting room
doesn't tell me chip.

29:53.691 --> 29:58.993
Especially when we've just come
from being locked up in some black hole,

29:59.063 --> 30:01.861
and I don't remember why I was there.

30:01.933 --> 30:05.630
Well, try and remember,
and I can help you.

30:05.703 --> 30:07.864
Tell me what's wrong with her.

30:07.939 --> 30:10.169
<i>Why is she like that?</i>

30:10.241 --> 30:13.677
Uh, oh, well, that's just a by-product
of what brought you here.

30:13.745 --> 30:17.340
But soon as she gets back to her own time,
she'll be fine, and so will you.

30:17.415 --> 30:23.320
<i>But now I need for you to tell me
what happened to Carol Benning.</i>

30:23.388 --> 30:26.152
<i>You've gotta remember.
Carol Benning?</i>

30:27.258 --> 30:29.590
I can't even remember
my own last name.

30:29.661 --> 30:32.596
How do you expect me to remember
who killed Carol Benning?

30:32.664 --> 30:35.531
Well, see, you remembered
that she was killed.

30:36.935 --> 30:38.869
See? So, keep going.

30:38.937 --> 30:41.371
Take your time.
But just keep going.

30:41.439 --> 30:43.373
It'll all come back.

30:43.441 --> 30:49.038
Carol Benning said something to you
just before she died.

30:53.651 --> 30:57.883
<i>When they chained me down, I don't
know what happened, but suddenly I-</i>

30:57.956 --> 30:59.947
I couldn't hold on.

31:01.392 --> 31:04.384
I couldn't remember
anything good in my life.

31:06.764 --> 31:09.028
It was like I didn't know-

31:10.435 --> 31:14.872
I didn't know my mother, or my father,
or where my home was, or anything.

31:14.939 --> 31:17.874
Your mind is still
Swiss-cheesed from-

31:17.942 --> 31:19.933
from the confinement.

31:21.079 --> 31:23.070
What?

31:24.282 --> 31:26.876
Big pieces of your memory
are missing.

31:26.951 --> 31:30.751
If you imagine a hunk
of Swiss cheese, right,

31:30.822 --> 31:32.756
the big holes
could represent things like-

31:32.824 --> 31:35.793
like your mother or your father,
your name, or something like that,

31:35.860 --> 31:39.694
and the little holes could be simple little things
- No, it's more, Liz.

31:39.764 --> 31:42.699
It's like I'm living
someone else's life.

31:42.767 --> 31:45.702
Every memory I have,
it's not- it's not my life.

31:45.770 --> 31:49.137
I know, I know.
I mean, this is insane.

31:49.207 --> 31:53.007
I know none of this
makes any sense to you right now.

31:53.077 --> 31:55.602
But everything you're feeling is real.

31:55.680 --> 31:57.614
It's all the truth.

31:57.682 --> 32:02.619
You gotta trust me
and just stay where you are right now.

32:02.687 --> 32:05.781
Stay in that place until I can
figure a way to get you out of here.

32:08.493 --> 32:10.620
Okay?

32:11.696 --> 32:16.224
Angel, I need you to remember
everything you can about Angel's life. Okay?

32:16.301 --> 32:19.236
Everything about the day
that Carol Benning died. Right?

32:19.304 --> 32:23.900
She came to you, and she was hurt and
bleeding, and she wanted your help.

32:24.909 --> 32:26.672
You've gotta remember.

32:27.812 --> 32:30.372
She was afraid.
Afraid of what?

32:33.284 --> 32:36.048
I can't remember.
Try. Just try.

32:40.625 --> 32:42.616
Well,

32:42.694 --> 32:44.924
Meyers was angry at her
because she was-

32:44.996 --> 32:46.930
<i>Get up.!
Get up, I said.</i>

32:46.998 --> 32:48.932
<i>Meyers is on the rampage.!</i>

32:49.000 --> 32:52.436
You didn't tell me he was expecting you.
You didn't tell me you were goin' under.

32:52.503 --> 32:54.937
Goin' under? Everybody knows
what "goin' under" means.

32:55.006 --> 32:57.440
Now get back in the box. Wait!
She can't go back in there.

32:57.508 --> 33:01.000
<i>You must be stupid and crazy. Look, if
you put her back in there, it'll kill her.</i>

33:01.079 --> 33:04.014
If she doesn't get back in the box,
I'll kill her myself. Wait! Wait!

33:04.082 --> 33:08.519
I'll take her down to the old transfer
tunnels. You can't. Meyers'll skin me alive.

33:08.586 --> 33:12.022
I don't know how long I can keep you there,
but at least it's not that box. Come on.

33:12.090 --> 33:14.581
<i>No! You can't take
her out ofhere, Vivian.</i>

33:14.659 --> 33:17.253
<i>- What are you doing?
- It's the only choice you've got.</i>

33:17.328 --> 33:20.195
<i>Well, you better hurry up
and do whatever it is you're gonna do.</i>

33:20.264 --> 33:23.927
<i>- What do ya say?
- Don't be ridiculous, Vivian. She's a prisoner.</i>

33:24.002 --> 33:26.129
<i>- Okay. Come on.
- Vivian-</i>

33:29.807 --> 33:32.241
I can't let you out of here.

33:32.310 --> 33:34.301
I'm sorry about this.

33:36.848 --> 33:39.476
<i>Go, go, go. Go.!</i>

33:45.923 --> 33:49.017
<i>Shh. Shh. Inside!</i>

33:49.093 --> 33:52.927
<i>I came down to "C"block
and said I was bringin'her up to see you.</i>

33:55.533 --> 33:57.694
She knew. I swear.

34:03.007 --> 34:04.941
Masterson said
Liz was down here.

34:05.009 --> 34:08.172
I want to know who moved her,
and I want them keelhauled.

34:14.752 --> 34:17.118
<i>It's gonna be okay.</i>

34:17.188 --> 34:19.588
<i>Yeah. No, don't-</i>

34:19.657 --> 34:22.091
<i>Everything's
gonna be okay.</i>

34:22.159 --> 34:25.219
<i>I'm right here, Angel.
I'm not goin'anywhere.</i>

34:25.295 --> 34:28.663
<i>You're okay. I'm not gonna
leave you. You stood me up.</i>

34:33.404 --> 34:35.395
Angel needed me.

34:38.976 --> 34:41.467
Mother, murderer,

34:41.545 --> 34:44.106
psychotherapist.

34:45.116 --> 34:48.108
Is there anything
that you don't do?

34:49.387 --> 34:51.446
Well, some things, yeah.

34:57.061 --> 34:59.689
You shouldn't have stood me up,
you know.

35:00.698 --> 35:04.930
I had such fun things
planned for us.

35:05.002 --> 35:09.132
<i>Yeah, well,
uh, could you let Angel out?</i>

35:09.207 --> 35:11.437
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

35:11.509 --> 35:15.809
Business first,
and then pleasure.

35:17.915 --> 35:21.112
Who killed Carol?

35:22.987 --> 35:25.217
Sam. Sam, you don't
have much time.

35:25.289 --> 35:27.280
Their computer
is gonna lock on Alia.

35:27.358 --> 35:31.385
Well, what can I do? Lothos is
picking up a transmission on Alia.

35:31.462 --> 35:34.192
Where?
Right there.

35:34.265 --> 35:36.733
<i>- Sophie, open that door.
- The last transmission was in here.</i>

35:36.801 --> 35:38.564
No.
Move it, Liz.

35:38.636 --> 35:40.570
Out of my way!

35:49.547 --> 35:51.538
<i>It's Beckett.!</i>

35:54.752 --> 35:56.686
- Stop him!
- Him? What?

35:56.754 --> 36:00.554
<i>Stop him.! Get a lock on him
and find him, right now.!</i>

36:00.625 --> 36:04.721
Open that door. Open that door!

36:08.833 --> 36:10.767
No!

36:14.872 --> 36:18.239
Get up, Masterson.
Get up, you stupid fool!

36:21.345 --> 36:24.280
<i>Security break in block "C';</i>

36:28.119 --> 36:31.316
<i>Johnson! Two!
Close all access to the yard.</i>

36:33.991 --> 36:37.825
<i>Let's go.! Let's move it.!
All right. Up on the steps.!</i>

36:37.895 --> 36:41.092
<i>All security to perimeter posts.</i>

36:42.133 --> 36:45.534
<i>You take two people with you.
Okay. Goin'up to "C"block.</i>

36:47.305 --> 36:52.368
<i>All guards not assigned to the perimeter
report to the armory for search detail.</i>

36:57.782 --> 37:01.047
<i>No prisoners allowed
in or out of the blocks.</i>

37:04.455 --> 37:06.252
<i>Clear at the tower.</i>

37:07.692 --> 37:11.219
Sam, the old transfer tunnels
are just 50 yards from here.

37:11.295 --> 37:13.729
Which way?
Are we talkin' to somebody?

37:13.798 --> 37:16.232
It's just across the yard
and down that alley.

37:16.300 --> 37:19.497
Al, who the hell
was that other woman?

37:19.570 --> 37:22.004
Well, Ziggy says
she's someone named Zoey.

37:22.073 --> 37:25.008
She was Alia's hologram,
but now she's another leaper.

37:25.076 --> 37:29.069
- Must have been the other leaper that Ziggy was pickin' up.
- She's gonna be your worst nightmare.

37:30.748 --> 37:34.445
Sam, you've gotta get outta here. Yeah, okay, you
tell me how to get out of here, and I'll do it.

37:34.518 --> 37:36.418
Oh, we're planning a getaway,
huh, Doctor?

37:36.487 --> 37:39.251
- You know that guard that was helping you?
- Vivian.

37:39.323 --> 37:42.850
- What about Vivian?
- 91% chance she can help you get over the wall.

37:42.927 --> 37:46.158
Al, if Zoey's leaping now, doesn't that
mean she's gotta have a hologram?

37:46.230 --> 37:48.960
Hey, two points
for the home team.

37:49.033 --> 37:51.524
Uh, Ziggy's working on that.

37:52.570 --> 37:56.836
- I swore to Alia I'd get her out of here.
- Alia?

37:58.376 --> 38:02.176
Sam, move it. Get outta here! Go down
the alley, second door on the right.

38:02.246 --> 38:04.237
Go!

38:09.553 --> 38:11.487
Alia!
Gone.

38:11.555 --> 38:14.217
What the hell do you mean,
she's gone? She's gone!

38:16.661 --> 38:19.596
Where is Sam Beckett? I left
him hiding in the courtyard.

38:19.664 --> 38:22.599
You know, there's a 95% chance
that he's gonna go over the wall.

38:22.667 --> 38:26.103
Perfect. Now I have an
excuse to shoot them both.

38:26.170 --> 38:29.003
<i>Get a lock on Beckett
and stay with him.</i>

38:29.073 --> 38:31.007
Damn!

38:31.075 --> 38:33.441
<i>This is impossible.
Now what?</i>

38:33.511 --> 38:35.706
They've done something
to jam our Lothos's "S" and "L."

38:35.780 --> 38:37.645
You just had him.

38:37.715 --> 38:41.845
They're jamming our externals.
We can't get a search and lock!

38:41.919 --> 38:43.853
<i>Override.</i>

38:43.921 --> 38:46.788
<i>Someone turn off those
damn sirens! I'll get it.!</i>

38:58.936 --> 39:04.431
<i>I repeat, a security break in block "C."
Close all access to the yard.</i>

39:10.948 --> 39:13.883
<i>Liz. Now what the hell
am I supposed to do?</i>

39:13.951 --> 39:15.885
Where's Alia?
What?

39:15.953 --> 39:18.513
Angel. Where's Angel?
Get down! Over here!

39:24.362 --> 39:28.799
What's happening? They know you're gone,
and I'm gonna get shot right along with you.

39:28.866 --> 39:32.029
I gotta take you back.
Listen to me. Listen to me.

39:32.103 --> 39:35.504
This isn't gonna make any sense,
and I don't expect you to believe me,

39:35.573 --> 39:38.736
but I don't have any choice now.

39:38.809 --> 39:41.744
I gotta tell you the truth. The
truth is, I'm gonna take you back.

39:41.812 --> 39:43.746
No, wait.
Vivian, please.

39:43.814 --> 39:46.715
Hey! Wait a second, all
right? Just wait a second.

39:47.752 --> 39:49.743
I'm not Liz.

39:50.921 --> 39:53.549
And this is not Angel.

39:56.160 --> 39:58.993
We're time travelers
from the future,

39:59.063 --> 40:01.156
and so is Meyers.

40:02.366 --> 40:04.300
This is no time to be funny, Liz.

40:04.368 --> 40:06.268
My name's not Liz.

40:08.339 --> 40:11.797
I'm a man.
My name is Sam Beckett.

40:13.911 --> 40:17.472
And Meyers
is a woman named Zoey.

40:17.548 --> 40:20.278
Oh. Meyers is a woman.

40:20.351 --> 40:22.478
<i>Uh-huh.
Zoey?</i>

40:27.024 --> 40:28.958
We don't have a lot of time.

40:29.026 --> 40:32.189
This Zoey person
is a horrible, horrible person,

40:32.263 --> 40:35.790
and she's traveled across time to kill her,
and you're our only hope.

40:35.866 --> 40:37.561
This is unreal.

40:37.635 --> 40:40.502
Forget reality, all right?
Forget everything you've ever known.

40:40.571 --> 40:45.031
If you don't help us, then
- Please, you've gotta help us. Please! Hey, wait a minute!

40:46.444 --> 40:50.107
<i>If I'm gettin' ready to step into The
Twilight Zone, I need a damn minute.</i>

40:51.215 --> 40:55.675
<i>Now, give me one good reason
why I should believe you.</i>

41:00.124 --> 41:02.058
How long have you known Liz?

41:02.126 --> 41:04.321
A long time.

41:06.063 --> 41:08.554
Would she make up a story like this?

41:18.642 --> 41:20.633
All right.

41:22.780 --> 41:26.409
<i>- All right. I know how I can get you out.
- Okay.</i>

41:26.484 --> 41:30.386
And this better be a flashback
of some drug I did in the '60s.

41:30.454 --> 41:32.649
Come on.

41:32.723 --> 41:36.159
<i>No prisoners allowed
in or out of the blocks.</i>

41:38.229 --> 41:40.424
Lothos has lost them.
We have nothing.

41:40.498 --> 41:43.934
Look, we know they can't get out
of the complex. Oh, do we really?

41:44.001 --> 41:46.936
Yeah. The only way outta here
is through that gate or that one.

41:47.004 --> 41:48.938
Neither one of'em
opens without keys.

41:49.006 --> 41:51.941
Anything else gettin' outta
here is movin' on four legs.

41:52.009 --> 41:54.034
<i>Close that front gate.!</i>

41:59.283 --> 42:05.188
Okay, here, at the end of the tunnel,
there's an electric gate.

42:05.256 --> 42:08.817
Give me five minutes.
I'm gonna cut the power.

42:08.893 --> 42:13.557
When I do, you got 15 seconds
to cut the lock and get out...

42:13.631 --> 42:15.997
before the backup generator
kicks in.

42:16.066 --> 42:18.227
I'll be right behind you.
All right.

42:18.302 --> 42:20.065
Come on.
Why are you doing this?

42:21.472 --> 42:23.406
Does it matter?
Yes.

42:23.474 --> 42:26.568
I want to know why some people
help other people.

42:26.644 --> 42:30.637
'Cause all my life
I never did anything really special.

42:30.714 --> 42:35.083
<i>And if one-tenth of what you said
is true, then this is special.</i>

42:36.287 --> 42:41.224
For once,
I want to be the good guy.

42:42.326 --> 42:44.317
Go ahead.

42:49.967 --> 42:52.094
Come on.

42:52.169 --> 42:54.569
Hurry up. Come on.

42:56.674 --> 42:59.302
Come on! Let's move it!

42:59.376 --> 43:01.310
Lothos has a theory.

43:01.378 --> 43:03.437
I'm waiting.

43:03.514 --> 43:07.780
He thinks the power emitted from the electrical fences may
have been converted and is being used as a cloaking device.

43:07.851 --> 43:11.582
He says if you shut down the power,
we can get a lock and-

43:12.590 --> 43:14.524
Find them.

43:14.592 --> 43:17.527
Come on.

43:17.595 --> 43:19.529
Got 'em!

43:19.597 --> 43:22.828
They're outside the perimeter.
Northwest side.

43:22.900 --> 43:25.630
Get me a vehicle!
Get me a gun!

43:25.703 --> 43:28.695
<i>Come on.</i>

43:32.242 --> 43:34.176
Come on.

43:34.244 --> 43:36.235
Hurry up.

43:44.955 --> 43:46.889
You all right?
Yeah.

43:46.957 --> 43:48.982
Come on.

43:49.059 --> 43:52.654
- Sam, they've got a lock on you.
- Well, have Ziggy override it.

43:52.730 --> 43:56.564
The electric fences were your force field. When you
blew the power and left the perimeter, no force field.

43:56.634 --> 43:58.499
All right.

43:58.569 --> 44:00.366
Rumpelstiltskin.

44:04.208 --> 44:06.199
Sam.

44:07.745 --> 44:10.339
- Where are we?
- Gotcha!

44:11.482 --> 44:13.848
Holograms at your service, baby.

44:13.917 --> 44:16.044
- Thames.
- Thames? What?

44:16.120 --> 44:18.918
- You ready to die, sweet cakes?
- Where's Zoey?

44:18.989 --> 44:22.220
Timing.
It's all timing, baby.

44:22.292 --> 44:25.386
Zoey's here, Alia.
She leaped.

44:29.400 --> 44:32.335
Come on. We gotta get goin'!
It's over, Sam.

44:32.403 --> 44:35.372
No. It's not over
unless we say it's over.

44:35.439 --> 44:39.535
- It's over. Save yourself.
- Ain't nobody gettin' saved tonight.

44:39.610 --> 44:41.976
<i>Zoey.! They're over here.!</i>

44:43.781 --> 44:45.772
<i>Sam, they're getting closer.!</i>

44:45.849 --> 44:47.680
<i>Come on. We gotta go.
Go, go, go.!</i>

44:53.924 --> 44:57.621
<i>Stay with 'em. Come on.
Go, go, go, go.!</i>

44:57.695 --> 44:59.629
Come on.

44:59.697 --> 45:02.029
I can't run from myself.
Come on!

45:02.099 --> 45:05.034
We gotta find a way. Sam, wait.
I'm not sure this is the right way!

45:05.102 --> 45:07.263
We just gotta keep
goin'. Come on. Uh-oh!

45:07.337 --> 45:09.931
<i>- Run, Sam. Save yourself.
- No.</i>

45:10.007 --> 45:12.066
Come on, Zoey!
It's you or me!

45:12.142 --> 45:13.905
Look out, Sam!
She's gonna shoot!

45:25.322 --> 45:27.950
<i>- Lothos has lost her.!
- That's impossible.</i>

45:28.025 --> 45:30.892
She was shot!

45:30.961 --> 45:32.895
I saw her get shot!

45:32.963 --> 45:35.591
- She leaped.
- She didn't leap back! He lost her!

45:35.666 --> 45:38.134
We still have you.

45:38.202 --> 45:39.931
Sam, look out!

45:43.140 --> 45:45.131
<i>Meyers has been hit.!
She's dying!</i>

45:45.209 --> 45:47.609
<i>Leap her out!
Get up here.! Get her weapon.!</i>

45:52.950 --> 45:54.975
<i>What's happening?</i>

45:55.052 --> 45:57.486
<i>What's going on?</i>

45:57.554 --> 46:02.218
You can't let Meyers take me, Vivian. You gotta
turn me over to the state troopers. You hear me?

46:02.292 --> 46:04.624
<i>She'll kill me!
Sophie, what's goin'on here?</i>

46:04.695 --> 46:06.629
<i>Please.
I don't know.</i>

46:06.697 --> 46:09.029
<i>Arrest her.!
Put the gun down!</i>

46:09.099 --> 46:12.034
I want this woman
held in state custody-

46:12.102 --> 46:15.594
<i>- Sam, Ziggy's comin'up with a bunch of stuffhere.!
- Until we call a formal investigation!</i>

46:15.672 --> 46:20.803
Get cuffs on her. And you, Vivian, you're under
arrest for helping those prisoners to escape.

46:20.878 --> 46:23.711
Liz says Meyers was responsible
for Carol's death!

46:23.781 --> 46:26.807
- Meyers killed Carol Benning.
- What the-

46:26.884 --> 46:29.114
- Meyers got her pregnant!
- Meyers got Carol pregnant.

46:29.186 --> 46:32.485
- That's a lie! She's lyin'!
- Then he forced her to have an abortion.

46:32.556 --> 46:34.456
<i>She was hemorrhaging,
and he let her bleed to death.!</i>

46:34.525 --> 46:37.722
He forced her to abort, and then when
it failed, he let her bleed to death.

46:37.795 --> 46:41.162
- She's nuts!
- A Dr. Paula Garcy has all the facts!

46:41.231 --> 46:44.496
- Dr. Paula Garcy knows everything.
- Hey, arrest the prisoner!

46:44.568 --> 46:46.832
<i>What do I do now?
Put her in the warden's car.</i>

46:46.904 --> 46:51.466
<i>- Get Garcy's records to the authorities.
No. She's in state custody till we sort this out.</i>

46:51.542 --> 46:53.476
What happens?

46:53.544 --> 46:55.478
Meyers and Sophie
take a fall,

46:55.546 --> 46:57.605
Angel and Liz are paroled,

46:57.681 --> 47:00.343
and Vivian ends up
running the prison.

47:00.417 --> 47:02.351
Everything's gonna be all right.
Trust me.

47:02.419 --> 47:04.182
What about your friend?

47:04.254 --> 47:08.486
Uh, we don't know where she is,
but wherever she is, she's free.

47:08.559 --> 47:10.493
She's gone, Vivian.

47:10.561 --> 47:12.654
<i>We did it.</i>

47:12.729 --> 47:15.994
And you got to be
one of the good guys.

47:17.167 --> 47:19.158
Thanks.

47:25.375 --> 47:29.209
Oh, you're so lucky.
I would just kill for your job.

47:29.279 --> 47:32.043
You would?
What's she like?

47:32.115 --> 47:34.345
I mean, really like, in private.

47:34.418 --> 47:38.252
Uh, well, she's, uh-
she's a little hard to describe.

47:38.322 --> 47:41.814
Spending every day with her,
getting to know the real person.

47:41.892 --> 47:43.757
<i>Marilyn.!
Here she comes!</i>

47:46.230 --> 47:48.255
Marilyn. Marilyn!
Miss Monroe!

47:48.332 --> 47:51.199
<i>Miss Monroe, this way.
May I have your autograph, please?</i>

47:51.268 --> 47:53.702
Can I have one more?

47:53.770 --> 47:56.739
<i>Miss Monroe.!
Miss Monroe.!</i>

47:56.807 --> 47:59.776
<i>Back it up, please.
Marilyn?</i>

48:06.483 --> 48:09.475
Come on, Dennis.
Take me away from all this.

48:10.554 --> 48:12.488
Oh, boy.

48:12.556 --> 48:16.185
<i>Can I have one more?
Miss Monroe.!</i>
