WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:02.303
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...

00:02.303 --> 00:04.105
I'M TAKING THE SHOT.
 NO, NO!

00:04.105 --> 00:05.536
WE DON'T KNOW IF PADMA'S
STILL ALIVE.

00:05.536 --> 00:06.777
WE WERE HOPING TO INVOLVE YOU

00:06.777 --> 00:08.739
WITH THE CAMPAIGN
IN A MORE OFFICIAL CAPACITY.

00:08.739 --> 00:10.211
THEY TAPE THEIR MEETINGS.

00:10.211 --> 00:12.283
BEEN HOLDING ON TO IT
IN CASE GRAYSON CAME AFTER ME.

00:12.283 --> 00:15.146
I'VE GIVEN SOME THOUGHT
TO YOUR OFFER. I ACCEPT.

00:15.146 --> 00:16.647
(Grace) THIS JUST CAME FOR YOU.
IT'S MARKED "URGENT."

00:20.121 --> 00:22.093
YOU'VE BEEN KEEPING SOMETHING
FROM ME, MASON.

00:22.093 --> 00:26.026
A VERY LONELY 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL
SURRENDERED HER FIRSTBORN SON.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.658
VICTORIA.

00:27.658 --> 00:29.800
SHE HAS ANOTHER SON.

00:37.808 --> 00:38.809
(snip)

00:44.245 --> 00:48.749
(Emily) ALL TOO OFTEN,
 WE MASK TRUTH IN ARTIFICE...

00:52.253 --> 00:57.188
CONCEALING OURSELVES FOR FEAR
 OF LOSING THE ONES WE LOVE...

01:08.339 --> 01:13.104
OR PROLONGING A DECEPTION
 FOR THOSE WE WISH TO EXPOSE.

01:23.554 --> 01:25.856
WE HIDE BEHIND THAT
 WHICH BRINGS US COMFORT

01:25.856 --> 01:28.819
FROM PAIN AND SADNESS...

01:32.693 --> 01:35.696
(marker squeaking)

01:42.133 --> 01:47.408
OR USE IT TO REPEL A TRUTH
 TOO DEVASTATING TO ACCEPT.

01:47.408 --> 01:48.779
(cell phone rings)

01:48.779 --> 01:50.581
(ring)

01:50.581 --> 01:51.742
(ring, beep)

01:51.742 --> 01:53.284
(clears throat) DURAND.

01:53.284 --> 01:55.516
WELL, YOU'LL NOTICE I LEFT
"DETECTIVE" OFF THERE

01:55.516 --> 01:57.218
SINCE YOU HAVEN'T FOUND

01:57.218 --> 01:58.549
Padma yet.

01:58.549 --> 02:00.791
YOU'RE LUCKY I EVEN
CALL YOU BACK, ROSS.
 Why?

02:00.791 --> 02:02.793
'CAUSE I REALLY THOUGHT
THAT WE MENDED FENCES

02:02.793 --> 02:04.395
AFTER YOU MISGUIDEDLY

02:04.395 --> 02:05.796
questioned me
in her disappearance.

02:05.796 --> 02:07.558
I DON'T KNOW. WHAT WAS IT,
SIX WEEKS AGO?

02:07.558 --> 02:09.560
THAT WAS ROUTINE.
TELLING YOU EVERY DAY

02:09.560 --> 02:11.131
we have no new leads isn't.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.404
SO UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMETHING
NEW, I GOT A JOB TO DO.

02:13.404 --> 02:14.905
I WISH I DID.

02:14.905 --> 02:16.437
LIKE I TOLD YOU,

02:16.437 --> 02:18.809
IT'S THE FIRST 48 HOURS THAT
MATTER THE MOST, AND WE'RE--

02:18.809 --> 02:21.912
968 HOURS PAST THAT.

02:21.912 --> 02:23.874
RIGHT. GOT IT.

02:23.874 --> 02:25.346
(beep)

02:25.346 --> 02:26.777
(sighs)

02:29.880 --> 02:32.753
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN HERE?

02:32.753 --> 02:36.557
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

02:36.557 --> 02:37.728
(rustles paper)

02:37.728 --> 02:39.560
AFTER I LOST PADMA,

02:39.560 --> 02:41.362
I FOUND THIS.

02:41.362 --> 02:44.495
SHE SAYS THAT SHE'S LUCKY
THAT I DIDN'T ABANDON HER

02:44.495 --> 02:45.796
AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED.

02:45.796 --> 02:48.799
(sighs) SHE SAID
SHE'D WAIT FOR ME FOREVER.

02:48.799 --> 02:50.441
SHE'S SOMEWHERE...

02:50.441 --> 02:52.343
OUT THERE, EMS,
WAITING FOR ME.

02:52.343 --> 02:53.744
NOLAN--

02:53.744 --> 02:55.476
LOOK, I HAVE TO
BELIEVE IT.

02:55.476 --> 02:56.807
YOU KNOW,
EVEN IF EVERY ALLEY

02:56.807 --> 02:58.679
THAT I RUN DOWN
IS A DEAD END.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.712
AND EVERY TIME
I TRY TO HELP WITH PADMA,

03:01.712 --> 03:03.183
AMANDA,

03:03.183 --> 03:04.355
OR... (scoffs)

03:04.355 --> 03:05.956
EVEN THE WHITE-HAIRED MAN
LAST YEAR,

03:05.956 --> 03:08.219
I... FAIL.

03:08.219 --> 03:10.721
DON'T FORGET
THAT YOU SAVED JACK'S LIFE.

03:10.721 --> 03:13.864
(cell phone chimes)

03:13.864 --> 03:16.867
(beep)

03:16.867 --> 03:19.970
WOW. (exhales)
START YOUR REVENG-INES.

03:19.970 --> 03:21.972
THAT'S HIM,
RIGHT ON CUE.

03:21.972 --> 03:25.306
LOOK, I KNOW HE'S GETTING
IN DEEP WITH THE GRAYSONS.

03:25.306 --> 03:28.739
SO... WHAT DO
YOU TWO HAVE BREWING?

03:28.739 --> 03:30.541
I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THAT.

03:30.541 --> 03:32.243
JACK STILL WON'T LET ME IN.

03:34.385 --> 03:36.547
NOLAN, YOUR FRIENDS
NEED YOU.

03:36.547 --> 03:39.690
YOU CAN'T KEEP HIDING AWAY
IN THIS CAVE.

03:39.690 --> 03:41.592
AND IF WE'RE
GONNA FIND PADMA,

03:41.592 --> 03:44.755
I THINK I HAVE A GOOD IDEA.
YOU JUST NEED TO TRUST ME.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.499
(door opens)

03:48.499 --> 03:49.930
(inhales sharply) OH.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.862
HMM.

03:51.862 --> 03:55.436
AH, THE R.S.V.P.s
TO THE GRAYSON MASQUERADE...
 (cell phone beeps)

03:55.436 --> 03:56.907
EACH ONE A PERSON

03:56.907 --> 03:58.669
WHO'LL PRETEND TO BE
YOUR FRIEND FOR THE NIGHT.
 (beep)

03:58.669 --> 03:59.940
YOU KNOW, TRY AS YOU MIGHT,

03:59.940 --> 04:01.572
YOU ARE NOT GONNA RUIN
MY GOOD MOOD FOR THE DAY,

04:01.572 --> 04:03.574
OR MY BALL, WHICH,
IF MEMORY SERVES,

04:03.574 --> 04:05.846
WE HAD TO CANCEL LAST YEAR
DUE TO YOUR MURDER CHARGE.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.848
YEAH, DON'T REMIND ME.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.950
(clicks tongue) AWW.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.722
LISI MILLER CAN'T MAKE IT.

04:11.722 --> 04:12.883
IT APPEARS SHE'S HEADED

04:12.883 --> 04:14.024
FOR A FRIEND'S
"DESTINATION DIVORCE,"

04:14.024 --> 04:15.486
WHATEVER THAT IS.

04:15.486 --> 04:16.987
BUT SLOANE HANOVER'S
GOING TO BE THERE.

04:16.987 --> 04:18.488
SHE'S DYING TO SEE YOU.

04:18.488 --> 04:20.331
YOU'RE DYING
TO SET ME UP.

04:20.331 --> 04:21.992
WELL, IT HAS BEEN
OVER SIX WEEKS SINCE

04:21.992 --> 04:23.894
YOUR FAILED RECONCILIATION
ATTEMPT WITH EMILY.

04:23.894 --> 04:27.498
YES, BASED ON A THREAT
FROM THE INITIATIVE.

04:27.498 --> 04:29.269
THE PICTURE AND THE BULLETS,
REMEMBER?

04:29.269 --> 04:30.801
YOU KNOW I'D NEVER RISK
EMILY'S LIFE,

04:30.801 --> 04:32.603
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
I WANT HER BY MY SIDE.
 (cell phone chimes)

04:32.603 --> 04:35.376
WELL, ALL THE MORE REASON
NOT TO HOLD OUT HOPE.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.808
(beep)
 REGARDLESS, I'M LOOKING
FORWARD TO TONIGHT.

04:37.808 --> 04:40.881
THE WOMEN WILL COME,
WHETHER I BID THEM OR NOT.

04:40.881 --> 04:44.054
LIKE YOU'VE EVER APPROVED OF
ANY GIRL I'VE CHOSEN MYSELF.

04:44.054 --> 04:45.986
FOR GOOD REASON.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.958
CONRAD'S AT THE STOWAWAY.

04:47.958 --> 04:49.490
SHOULDN'T YOU BE THERE
AS WELL?

04:49.490 --> 04:52.363
YES, BUT THESE R.S.V.P.s
CAME TO CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS.

04:52.363 --> 04:54.925
I THOUGHT YOU'D APPRECIATE IT
IF I DROPPED THEM OFF.

04:54.925 --> 04:57.628
AH, THE LOVELY PEOPLE
WHO'VE BOUGHT THEIR WAY IN.

04:57.628 --> 05:00.701
AND APPARENTLY
ONE WHO'S BEEN WAITING

05:00.701 --> 05:02.002
40 YEARS FOR THE HONOR.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.635
IN ADDITION
TO THE CHARMING MESSAGE,

05:04.635 --> 05:07.638
IT'S POSTMARKED 1973.

05:07.638 --> 05:09.610
SO EITHER SOMEONE'S HAVING
A GOOD HALLOWEEN LAUGH,

05:09.610 --> 05:12.983
OR THE POSTAL SERVICE
REALLY HAS OUTDONE ITSELF.

05:17.988 --> 05:19.990
(woman) THE NAUSEA
YOU'VE BEEN FEELING

05:19.990 --> 05:23.694
AND THE DIZZINESS--
THEY'RE SYMPTOMS OF PREGNANCY.

05:23.694 --> 05:26.457
YOU'RE BETWEEN SEVEN
AND EIGHT WEEKS ALONG.

05:26.457 --> 05:28.859
IS THE BABY'S FATHER
STILL IN THE PICTURE?

05:28.859 --> 05:29.860
(crying)

05:29.860 --> 05:31.001
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CALL
YOUR PARENTS?

05:31.001 --> 05:32.363
I DON'T LIVE WITH THEM.

05:32.363 --> 05:33.704
YOU HAVE A CHOICE
AHEAD OF YOU--

05:33.704 --> 05:36.467
ONE THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.910
YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:39.910 --> 05:42.112
THIS IS JUST
A SEASONAL TRIFLE,

05:42.112 --> 05:43.974
NOT UNLIKE YOURSELF.

06:02.493 --> 06:03.664
SO DID YOU
GET THROUGH TO NOLAN?

06:03.664 --> 06:04.635
I HOPE SO.

06:04.635 --> 06:05.796
I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

06:05.796 --> 06:07.568
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
IN SUCH A STATE.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.700
YEAH, THAT MY MISJUDGMENT
PLACED HIM IN.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.402
YOU CAN'T CARRY
THIS BURDEN ALONE, AIDEN.

06:11.402 --> 06:12.743
I HAD A HAND IN THIS.

06:12.743 --> 06:14.545
WELL, I WAS THERE WHEN PADMA
WAS TAKEN, EMILY, NOT YOU.

06:14.545 --> 06:16.607
THERE'S STILL THE SMALLEST
CHANCE THAT SHE'S ALIVE.
 (horn honks)

06:16.607 --> 06:18.679
I PROMISED NOLAN
WE'D TRY TO FIND HER.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.681
YEAH, BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT,
WE HAVE TO DRAW OUT TRASK.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.653
AND NOW HE'S IN POSSESSION
OF CARRION,

06:22.653 --> 06:24.885
HE'S GONNA LAY IN WAIT.
WE'VE LOST OUR LEVERAGE.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.657
NOT ENTIRELY.

06:26.657 --> 06:28.659
WE STILL HAVE ONE CARD
LEFT TO PLAY.

06:28.659 --> 06:30.691
TORPEDO
THE INITIATIVE'S INVESTMENTS?

06:30.691 --> 06:32.623
I MEAN, IT'S RISKY.
DANIEL COULD FIRE ME.

06:32.623 --> 06:35.596
AND THEN WE'VE BOTH
LOST ACCESS TO DANIEL.

06:35.596 --> 06:37.568
IT'S NOW OR NEVER, AIDEN.

06:37.568 --> 06:39.500
I OWE IT TO NOLAN.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.932
YEAH, WE BOTH DO.

06:41.932 --> 06:43.734
SO WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

06:43.734 --> 06:45.836
WELL, I KNOW THAT VICTORIA
GOT THE R.S.V.P.

06:45.836 --> 06:49.009
NOW I JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE
SHE TAKES IT SERIOUSLY.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.511
I'M JUST SORRY
YOU WON'T BE AT THE BALL

06:50.511 --> 06:51.942
TO SEE YOUR HANDIWORK.

06:51.942 --> 06:55.886
I WOULDN'T STRIKE ME OFF
YOUR DANCE CARD JUST YET.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.823
(Ashley) HOW DO YOU PLAN
TO PROTECT LOCAL BUSINESS

07:02.823 --> 07:05.155
IF YOUR PLATFORM INCLUDES
COASTAL REDISTRICTING

07:05.155 --> 07:06.657
AND DEVELOPMENT?

07:06.657 --> 07:08.158
UH, THESE PEOPLE ARE TOWNIES.

07:08.158 --> 07:10.601
ARE THERE ANY OF THEM
SMART ENOUGH TO ASK THAT?

07:10.601 --> 07:11.802
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, YES.

07:11.802 --> 07:14.535
BUT TO ENSURE THAT
NONE OF THEM LOBS A GRENADE,

07:14.535 --> 07:16.066
I HAD THEM PRESUBMIT
THEIR QUESTIONS

07:16.066 --> 07:17.968
SO YOU WOULD BE PREPARED,
SO...

07:17.968 --> 07:20.140
SO A BODY CAN'T STAND
WITHOUT A HEALTHY BACKBONE.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.112
WHEN I'M ELECTED,
I'LL MAINTAIN

07:22.112 --> 07:23.974
THE WORKING-CLASS STAKE
IN OWNERSHIP

07:23.974 --> 07:25.946
AND DISTRIBUTE DIVIDENDS
AT ALL LEVELS.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.949
DON'T SAY "WORKING CLASS."

07:28.949 --> 07:31.181
I MEAN,
GOVERNOR'S A JOB, TOO.

07:31.181 --> 07:32.553
SOME OF THESE PEOPLE
AREN'T WORKING.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.485
SAY, UH, SAY "YOUR."

07:34.485 --> 07:37.528
I PLAN TO MAINTAIN
YOUR STAKE IN OWNERSHIP.

07:37.528 --> 07:40.831
MR. JACK PORTER, EVERYONE,

07:40.831 --> 07:43.463
THE VOICE OF THE POPULACE,
THE VOICE OF REASON,

07:43.463 --> 07:46.597
AND THE MAN WHO HELPED ME
CLOSE THE GAP TO 4 POINTS.
 (applause)

07:46.597 --> 07:48.168
(Ashley)
KNOCK THIS OUT OF THE PARK,

07:48.168 --> 07:50.000
AND STODDARD WON'T KNOW
WHAT HIT HIM.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.672
MAKE ANYONE WITH A MIC

07:51.672 --> 07:53.173
FEEL LIKE THEY'RE
THE ONLY PERSON IN THE ROOM.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.775
TAP YOUR INNER CLINTON.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.106
I CAN MANAGE THAT.

07:56.106 --> 07:58.148
BUT YOUR INNER CLINTON
TAPS NOTHING, NOT ANYMORE.

07:58.148 --> 08:00.511
RIGHT, MS. DAVENPORT?
(chuckles)

08:01.882 --> 08:04.615
THANK GOD EVAN WON'T BE
AT THE MASQUERADE TONIGHT.

08:04.615 --> 08:06.757
NOTHING COULD HIDE
THOSE BEADY EYES.

08:06.757 --> 08:08.519
BUT YOU'LL BE THERE,
WON'T YOU, JACK?

08:08.519 --> 08:09.660
YEAH.

08:09.660 --> 08:10.991
COULD HELP US GET
ANOTHER COVER,

08:10.991 --> 08:12.793
LIKE THE ONE ON THE "POST"
THIS MORNING.

08:12.793 --> 08:15.866
I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF BUYING
MASKS FOR YOU AND YOUR BROTHER.

08:15.866 --> 08:18.529
WOULDN'T MISS IT.

08:18.529 --> 08:19.870
(boat horn blows in distance)

08:19.870 --> 08:22.573
CONRAD, YOU KNOW,
WITH SUCH A LATE SURGE,

08:22.573 --> 08:24.204
WE ARE RIPE
FOR AN OCTOBER SURPRISE.

08:24.204 --> 08:27.077
VICTORIA RECEIVED A SUSPICIOUS
R.S.V.P. THIS MORNING.

08:27.077 --> 08:30.240
IT SAID
"EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED,"

08:30.240 --> 08:32.142
AND IT WAS POSTMARKED 1973,

08:32.142 --> 08:34.144
WHICH JUST HAPPENS TO BE
THE YEAR YOUR OPPONENT

08:34.144 --> 08:36.847
WON HIS FIRST SEAT
ON THE COMMUNITY BOARD.

08:36.847 --> 08:38.948
STODDARD IS TRYING TO RATTLE US
BEFORE THIS EVENT.

08:38.948 --> 08:41.552
WHICH IS WHY WE WILL BE
 IN YOUR EAR

08:41.552 --> 08:43.823
DURING THE Q&A.

08:43.823 --> 08:45.856
JACK WILL BE THERE
TO PERSONALIZE YOUR RESPONSES,

08:45.856 --> 08:48.098
AND I'LL BE AT THE READY
IN CASE ANYONE GOES OFF BOOK.

08:48.098 --> 08:49.259
HUH.

08:49.259 --> 08:50.601
AND, CONRAD...

08:50.601 --> 08:51.702
HMM?

08:51.702 --> 08:53.033
WEAR A TIE.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.705
PEOPLE WANT TO BE ABLE
TO RELATE TO YOU,

08:54.705 --> 08:56.607
NOT FEEL LIKE YOU'RE
 ACTUALLY RELATED TO THEM.

08:56.607 --> 08:59.670
YOU ARE
DECEPTIVELY BRILLIANT.

08:59.670 --> 09:01.011
I LEARNED FROM THE BEST.

09:02.873 --> 09:05.646
YOU MEANT VICTORIA,
DIDN'T YOU?

09:05.646 --> 09:06.617
YEAH.

09:06.617 --> 09:08.548
AHH.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.882
(telephone ringing)
 DID YOU POUR
ALL OF TRASK'S FUNDS

09:11.882 --> 09:13.253
INTO EuroUnion SECURITIES?

09:13.253 --> 09:14.985
EVERYONE WAS SHORTING,
AND I THOUGHT THEY WERE WRONG.

09:14.985 --> 09:16.727
NO, NO, NO, NO,
YOU WEREN'T THINKING.

09:16.727 --> 09:17.928
I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT.

09:17.928 --> 09:18.989
OTHERWISE, YOU'RE TRYING
TO DESTROY MY COMPANY.

09:18.989 --> 09:20.330
I WAS TAKING A GAMBLE,
DANIEL.

09:20.330 --> 09:21.892
THAT'S THE NATURE OF BUSINESS.

09:21.892 --> 09:24.334
EASY TO SAY WHEN YOUR NAME
ISN'T ON THE DAMN BUILDING.

09:24.334 --> 09:25.966
LET ME SPEAK TO THE CLIENT.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.297
(elevator bell dings)
 OKAY, I'LL ACCEPT THE BLAME

09:27.297 --> 09:29.069
AND ASSURE HIM
THIS WON'T HAPPEN NEXT TIME.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.701
(elevator doors open)

09:30.701 --> 09:32.002
IF WE HAVE A NEXT TIME.

09:32.002 --> 09:34.144
(woman speaks indistinctly)

09:45.716 --> 09:46.887
(beep)

09:46.887 --> 09:48.719
(phone rings)
 (Emily) Hello?

09:48.719 --> 09:50.360
EMILY, IT WORKED.

09:50.360 --> 09:53.824
TRASK SHOWED.

09:53.824 --> 09:55.595
(knock on door)

09:55.595 --> 09:57.297
(closes door)
 JACK?

09:57.297 --> 09:58.669
IN HERE.

09:58.669 --> 10:01.131
♪♪♪

10:01.131 --> 10:02.673
I'M GONE A FEW WEEKS,

10:02.673 --> 10:05.636
AND YOU'VE ALREADY REPLACED ME
WITH A NEW B.F.F.

10:05.636 --> 10:07.838
SO HOW DO I BECOME A MEMBER
OF THIS...

10:07.838 --> 10:10.681
UNHOLY ALLIANCE?

10:10.681 --> 10:12.382
♪♪♪

10:12.382 --> 10:14.985
BOOM. YOU'RE IN.

10:14.985 --> 10:17.788
WHERE YOU BEEN HIDING?

10:17.788 --> 10:19.790
YOU HAVEN'T RETURNED
ANY OF MY CALLS.

10:19.790 --> 10:22.853
BEFORE WE
GET INTO THAT SAGA,

10:22.853 --> 10:25.355
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME YOURS?

10:25.355 --> 10:28.098
HAS CONNY REALLY CONVERTED YOU
INTO A TRUE BELIEVER?

10:28.098 --> 10:30.400
BECAUSE, UH, LAST WE SPOKE,

10:30.400 --> 10:33.333
YOU WERE HELL-BENT ON
CARRYING OUT AMANDA'S WISHES.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.835
OH, I STILL AM.

10:34.835 --> 10:37.367
BUT CONRAD HAS ME COACHING HIM
THROUGH AN EARWIG

10:37.367 --> 10:38.709
FOR THIS TOWN HALL MEETING.
 (scoffs)

10:38.709 --> 10:40.370
I WANTED TO USE
THAT OPPORTUNITY

10:40.370 --> 10:42.372
TO... TRIP HIM UP.

10:42.372 --> 10:45.145
TRIP HIM UP? HOW?

10:45.145 --> 10:47.147
THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.648
(drawer opens)

10:48.648 --> 10:50.781
NATE
SECRETLY RECORDED CONRAD

10:50.781 --> 10:53.123
PRACTICALLY SIGNING OFF
ON AMANDA'S MURDER.

10:53.123 --> 10:54.725
(clicks)
 (Nate) LET'S SAY SOMEBODY

10:54.725 --> 10:56.757
WAS ABLE TO REMOVE THIS
 LEVERAGE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.158
(click)
 I GOT IT FROM KENNY

10:58.158 --> 11:00.390
WHEN I CONFRONTED HIM
ABOUT THE BOAT.

11:00.390 --> 11:02.662
CAN YOU HELP ME?

11:04.695 --> 11:06.396
SHOW ME THE EARWIG.

11:06.396 --> 11:08.699
(huffs)

11:08.699 --> 11:11.872
VICTORIA?

11:13.443 --> 11:16.176
APOLOGIES
FOR THE INTRUSION.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.179
AN INTRUSION IS GRACING
MY FOYER UNANNOUNCED.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.411
I DON'T THINK I HAVE A WORD
FOR WHAT THIS IS.

11:21.411 --> 11:23.383
YOU CAN CALL IT
A PEACE OFFERING.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.085
I WAS HERE FOR CHARLOTTE
AND REALIZED

11:25.085 --> 11:27.687
THAT I HADN'T SEEN YOU
IN WEEKS AND...

11:27.687 --> 11:29.359
TO ASK--

11:29.359 --> 11:31.421
WELL, HOPE, ACTUALLY--

11:31.421 --> 11:33.423
THAT MY INVITATION
TO THE BALL TONIGHT

11:33.423 --> 11:34.995
GOT LOST IN THE MAIL.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.426
YOU WANT TO ATTEND?

11:36.426 --> 11:38.068
IT IS THE EVENT
OF THE SEASON.

11:38.068 --> 11:39.399
MM.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.231
WELL, I'M AFRAID
THAT NO INVITATION WAS LOST

11:41.231 --> 11:43.774
BECAUSE NONE WAS SENT.

11:43.774 --> 11:45.435
DANIEL HAS MOVED ON.

11:45.435 --> 11:47.277
AND MAYBE YOU SHOULD, TOO.

11:47.277 --> 11:48.779
THIS ISN'T ABOUT DANIEL.

11:48.779 --> 11:50.781
WELL, IT MAY BE HALLOWEEN,

11:50.781 --> 11:54.384
BUT CERTAIN GHOSTS
ARE BEST LEFT OUTSIDE.

11:54.384 --> 11:56.186
(chuckles)

11:56.186 --> 11:57.347
IT'S FUNNY.

11:57.347 --> 11:59.119
THE LAST TIME YOU SPOKE
OF GHOSTS

11:59.119 --> 12:00.921
WAS AT AMANDA'S FUNERAL.

12:00.921 --> 12:03.123
HOW YOU WANTED TO PROTECT
YOUR CHILDREN SO...

12:03.123 --> 12:04.494
YOU DON'T OUTLIVE THEM.

12:04.494 --> 12:05.756
DID I SAY THAT?

12:05.756 --> 12:06.997
YOU PUT IT MORE ELEGANTLY,
OF COURSE.

12:06.997 --> 12:08.859
YOU SAID THAT LOSING A CHILD

12:08.859 --> 12:11.962
GOES AGAINST THE NATURAL ORDER
OF THINGS.

12:13.363 --> 12:15.135
WELL...

12:15.135 --> 12:18.468
IT'S NO SECRET THAT I'LL DO
ANYTHING FOR MY CHILDREN.

12:20.310 --> 12:23.343
WELL, HAVE A LOVELY EVENING,
VICTORIA.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.745
I'M SORRY TO MISS IT.

12:36.386 --> 12:37.928
BOLD MOVE YOU MADE TODAY.

12:37.928 --> 12:39.759
IT WILL HAVE REPERCUSSIONS.

12:39.759 --> 12:43.133
MY COLLEAGUE GOT AHEAD
OF HIMSELF.

12:43.133 --> 12:45.365
AND YOU, IT WOULD SEEM.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.537
LISTEN, I'LL GET
YOUR MONEY BACK, MR. TRASK.

12:47.537 --> 12:49.199
THERE'S NO NEED
TO HURT ANYONE, ALL RIGHT?

12:49.199 --> 12:51.001
WHY SHOULD I DO
SUCH A THING?

12:51.001 --> 12:52.873
MAYBE TO BACK UP A THREAT.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.875
(opens drawer)

12:54.875 --> 12:57.047
LIKE THE ONE YOU MADE
TO ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND.
 (clatters)

12:57.047 --> 12:59.509
SINCE YOU SEEM TO KNOW
WHO WE ARE,

12:59.509 --> 13:01.812
YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT

13:01.812 --> 13:04.084
WE DON'T THREATEN
IN TWO DIMENSIONS.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.886
WE ACT IN THREE.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.418
RIGHT, AND WHEN YOU DO,
YOU RAIN DOWN DESTRUCTION.

13:08.418 --> 13:12.792
WHATEVER HORROR STORIES YOUR
PARENTS HAVE TOLD YOU, DANIEL,

13:12.792 --> 13:14.825
WE'VE EVOLVED.

13:14.825 --> 13:16.927
THE WORLD IS BUSY
DESTROYING ITSELF.

13:16.927 --> 13:19.930
THE REAL MONEY
IS IN HELPING REBUILD IT,

13:19.930 --> 13:21.231
WHICH IS WHY

13:21.231 --> 13:22.973
WE'RE LIQUIDATING OUR ASSETS
IN GRAYSON GLOBAL,

13:22.973 --> 13:24.104
EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.

13:24.104 --> 13:25.135
(chuckles)
LISTEN, THAT'S AN OVERREACTION.

13:25.135 --> 13:26.306
I CAN GET MATHIS IN LINE.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.939
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN.

13:28.939 --> 13:30.911
THERE'S MORE TO HIM
THAN YOU KNOW.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.542
WHY? WHAT'S HE UP TO?

13:32.542 --> 13:33.944
TODAY?

13:33.944 --> 13:35.886
OPENING THE DOOR FOR US
TO LEAVE YOUR COMPANY

13:35.886 --> 13:37.287
AND PART AS GENTLEMEN.

13:37.287 --> 13:40.891
BUT TOMORROW?
HE'S YOUR PROBLEM.

13:42.893 --> 13:44.895
WELL,
THEN IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE

13:44.895 --> 13:46.596
DOING BUSINESS WITH YOU,
MR. TRASK.

13:46.596 --> 13:48.098
MM.

13:48.098 --> 13:51.231
I'M GLAD YOU KNOW
WHEN TO TAKE THE WIN.

13:53.403 --> 13:55.866
(door opens)

13:55.866 --> 13:58.368
(door closes)

14:02.542 --> 14:04.374
(cell phone rings)

14:04.374 --> 14:06.246
(ring)

14:06.246 --> 14:07.417
(beep)

14:07.417 --> 14:08.979
DANIEL.
 (keys clatter)

14:08.979 --> 14:09.950
Emily,

14:09.950 --> 14:11.121
HI.

14:11.121 --> 14:13.123
IT'S SO GOOD
TO HEAR YOUR VOICE.

14:13.123 --> 14:14.454
Is now a good time?

14:14.454 --> 14:15.585
FOR WHAT, EXACTLY?

14:15.585 --> 14:17.287
I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU
IN SIX WEEKS.

14:17.287 --> 14:18.989
I KNOW. I'M--I'M SORRY.

14:18.989 --> 14:21.091
BUT IT WAS ALL
FOR YOUR PROTECTION.

14:21.091 --> 14:23.433
I ASSUMED YOU WERE
DOING IT FOR ME.

14:23.433 --> 14:24.935
WHAT CHANGED?

14:24.935 --> 14:26.997
I TOOK THE WIN.

14:26.997 --> 14:29.970
I want to celebrate with you
tonight at the masquerade.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.972
DANIEL, YOUR MOTHER MADE IT
VERY CLEAR TO ME

14:31.972 --> 14:33.974
THAT SHE DIDN'T
WANT ME THERE.

14:33.974 --> 14:36.646
WELL... I GUESS
WE'RE LUCKY HER DISAPPROVAL

14:36.646 --> 14:39.449
WILL BE STUFFED
BEHIND A MASK.

14:39.449 --> 14:41.481
LISTEN,
I'M ALREADY IN THE CITY,

14:41.481 --> 14:43.153
so I'll see you there?

14:43.153 --> 14:44.654
IT'S A DATE.

14:44.654 --> 14:46.886
(beep)

14:46.886 --> 14:48.488
(clatters)

14:58.228 --> 14:59.569
(snip)

15:05.235 --> 15:08.678
CHARLOTTE,
THAT'S A LOOK I KNOW WELL.

15:08.678 --> 15:11.081
STANDING IN THE PRESENT,

15:11.081 --> 15:13.413
BUT LIVING IN THE PAST.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.916
I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT AMANDA.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.019
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE'S GONE.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.021
(sighs)

15:21.021 --> 15:24.524
THAT IS SOMETHING I UNDERSTAND
MORE THAN YOU COULD KNOW.

15:24.524 --> 15:27.057
THESE JUST ARRIVED FOR YOU,
MRS. GRAYSON.

15:31.201 --> 15:32.702
DO YOU WANT THEM DISPLAYED?

15:32.702 --> 15:34.704
YOU CAN SET THEM
ON THE TABLE, MARTA.

15:34.704 --> 15:37.007
THANK YOU.

15:37.007 --> 15:38.668
(Charlotte) BLACK ROSES?

15:38.668 --> 15:40.610
FREAKY.

15:43.013 --> 15:45.075
(paper rustles)
 WHO SENT THEM?

15:48.678 --> 15:50.050
THEY'RE JUST
FROM THE FLORIST,

15:50.050 --> 15:51.551
THANKING US
FOR OUR BUSINESS.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.723
IT'S ONE ROSE SHORT.

15:53.723 --> 15:56.086
WELL, LET'S NOT OVERLOOK
THE THOUGHTFUL INTENT.

15:56.086 --> 15:57.587
A SYMBOL OF DYING LOVE?

15:57.587 --> 16:00.690
SEEMS MORE DISTURBING
THAN THOUGHTFUL.

16:04.694 --> 16:06.066
(Trask) CONFIRMED.

16:06.066 --> 16:08.968
ALL FUNDS SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED
IMMEDIATELY.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.471
ACCELERATE TO PHASE TWO.
 (beep)

16:13.043 --> 16:14.544
(closes door)

16:14.544 --> 16:16.306
TAKE LEXINGTON.

16:16.306 --> 16:19.509
IT'S FASTER
THIS TIME OF DAY.

16:19.509 --> 16:20.610
(clicks)

16:20.610 --> 16:23.413
UNLESS YOU KNOW
A MORE DIRECT ROUTE

16:23.413 --> 16:25.455
TO PADMA LAHARI.

16:27.357 --> 16:29.689
(Conrad) ...WHICH MY
HEALTH CARE PLAN SUPPORTS.
 (camera shutters clicking)

16:29.689 --> 16:33.393
I MEAN, MY HEART'S WITH
YOUR GRANDMOTHER, MISS DAILEY,

16:33.393 --> 16:35.995
AND EVERYONE LIVING
WITH ALZHEIMER'S.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.697
(clicking continues,
crowd murmuring)

16:37.697 --> 16:41.201
I KNOW THAT SHE VALUES
YOU THERE

16:41.201 --> 16:42.532
BY HER BEDSIDE,

16:42.532 --> 16:45.635
TEACHING HER THE WORLD
AS I'M SURE SHE TAUGHT YOU.

16:45.635 --> 16:49.309
I MEAN, WE'RE NOTHING
WITHOUT OUR FAMILIES.

16:49.309 --> 16:54.184
AND YOURS IS LUCKY TO HAVE
TWO SUCH STRONG WOMEN.

16:54.184 --> 16:56.216
I THANK YOU, EILEEN,
FOR YOUR QUESTION.

16:56.216 --> 16:57.317
(applause)

16:58.788 --> 17:00.350
(crowd murmuring)

17:00.350 --> 17:01.621
(Evan, amplified voice)
MR. GRAYSON,

17:01.621 --> 17:04.424
THIS IS TOM MULLEN.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.025
UH, MR. MULLEN...

17:06.025 --> 17:07.757
(lowered voice) TOM MULLEN IS
THE OWNER OF TOM'S CRAB SHACK.

17:07.757 --> 17:09.259
(chuckling)
BEFORE YOU FIRE AWAY,

17:09.259 --> 17:10.800
I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR THE BEST CRAB CAKES

17:10.800 --> 17:12.702
THIS TOWN HAS TO OFFER.
 (laughter)

17:12.702 --> 17:14.064
AND I'M CERTAINLY GONNA HAVE

17:14.064 --> 17:16.266
SOME FLOWN TO ALBANY
IF I EVER GET HOMESICK.

17:16.266 --> 17:17.607
WHY, THANK YOU,
MR. GRAYSON.

17:17.607 --> 17:19.569
AMANDA PORTER
WAS A FRIEND OF MINE.

17:19.569 --> 17:20.740
UH-HUH.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.071
AND I KNOW WE ALL
MISS HER.

17:22.071 --> 17:23.242
YEAH.

17:23.242 --> 17:24.414
SO MY QUESTION IS,

17:24.414 --> 17:26.045
WHEN THE TRUTH
ABOUT JURY TAMPERING

17:26.045 --> 17:27.377
IN HER FATHER'S TRIAL
CAME OUT,

17:27.377 --> 17:29.048
YOU VOWED TO TAKE ACTION.
 MM-HMM.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.251
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN, OR ARE YOU
GONNA ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT

17:31.251 --> 17:33.523
TO SWEEP DAVID CLARKE
UNDER THE RUG AGAIN?

17:33.523 --> 17:35.155
(clicking continues)

17:35.155 --> 17:37.127
(lowered voice) WHERE THE HELL
DID THAT QUESTION COME FROM?

17:37.127 --> 17:39.559
(crowd murmuring indistinctly)
 (Conrad) NOW LOOK, UH...

17:39.559 --> 17:40.790
(Nate, over earwig)
LET'S SAY SOMEBODY WAS ABLE

17:40.790 --> 17:42.262
TO REMOVE THIS LEVERAGE
 YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.563
IS THE DEAL BACK ON?

17:43.563 --> 17:44.694
(Conrad, over earwig)
 AS IT STANDS, MR. RYAN,

17:44.694 --> 17:46.666
THAT'S A PURELY
 HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.198
(Jack) TOM, LOOK,

17:48.198 --> 17:49.539
I SPEAK FOR MY LATE WIFE
WHEN I SAY

17:49.539 --> 17:50.670
I PERSONALLY ASKED CONRAD
NOT TO--

17:50.670 --> 17:53.273
NO, I'LL--I'LL ANSWER.
I'LL ANSWER, JACK.

17:53.273 --> 17:54.774
(camera shutters clicking)

17:54.774 --> 17:56.476
TOM, WHEN I'M ELECTED,

17:56.476 --> 17:58.408
I FULLY INTEND
TO REOPEN THAT CASE.

17:58.408 --> 18:01.481
AND IF JUDICIAL IMPROPRIETY
IS PROVEN,

18:01.481 --> 18:03.183
I WILL TAKE
EVERY APPROPRIATE MEASURE

18:03.183 --> 18:06.816
TO SECURE A PRESIDENTIAL PARDON
FOR DAVID CLARKE.

18:06.816 --> 18:08.818
(clicking continues,
crowd murmuring indistinctly)

18:08.818 --> 18:10.490
UH, UH... (chuckles) UH...

18:10.490 --> 18:12.292
NEXT QUESTION, PLEASE.

18:12.292 --> 18:15.365
(clicking continues)

18:24.834 --> 18:26.276
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU
DRAGGED DAVID CLARKE

18:26.276 --> 18:28.638
INTO THE CONVERSATION
ONE WEEK BEFORE THE ELECTION.

18:28.638 --> 18:29.809
(Conrad) WELL,
I WAS DOUBLE TAPPED

18:29.809 --> 18:31.511
WITH A ROGUE QUESTION.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.513
I GAVE THE ONLY ANSWER I KNEW
WOULD STOP THEIR NEXT SALVO.

18:33.513 --> 18:34.814
"THEIR"?

18:34.814 --> 18:36.646
I THOUGHT YOU BELIEVED
THAT KENNY RYAN

18:36.646 --> 18:38.348
WAS BEHIND THE STUNT.

18:38.348 --> 18:40.750
YEAH, I DID.

18:40.750 --> 18:43.753
UNTIL I FOUND THIS.

18:43.753 --> 18:44.894

41:38.597 --> 41:40.228
THANK YOU, SISTER.

41:41.670 --> 41:43.672
FOR EVERYTHING.

42:00.919 --> 42:03.952
(mouths words)

42:03.952 --> 42:07.255
(wind blowing)

42:10.629 --> 42:13.001
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU,
MY DEAR?

42:13.001 --> 42:15.303
SISTER, I NEED YOUR HELP.

42:17.535 --> 42:20.609
I'M PREGNANT

42:20.609 --> 42:22.971
AND I HAVE NOWHERE ELSE
TO GO.
