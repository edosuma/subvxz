00:31.167 --> 00:33.750
Yes, Jesus loves me.

00:35.375 --> 00:38.042
Yes, Jesus loves me.

00:39.833 --> 00:40.875
Yes...

00:42.833 --> 00:44.708
...Jesus loves me.

00:47.375 --> 00:48.875
The Bible...

00:50.125 --> 00:51.666
...tells me so.

01:00.083 --> 01:01.167
It's time.

01:29.708 --> 01:31.082
Hi sweetie, what's up?

01:31.083 --> 01:32.457
What time is it there?

01:32.458 --> 01:33.832
It's ten o'clock at night.

01:33.833 --> 01:35.457
Sun is barely rising here.

01:35.458 --> 01:36.708
And you're up already?

01:37.333 --> 01:39.124
Yeah, I want to
catch that first light.

01:39.125 --> 01:40.707
Haa!
That's a surprise.

01:40.708 --> 01:42.582
Since when do you ever get out
of bed this early for anything?

01:42.583 --> 01:44.333
Joy, honey, can you hear me?

01:45.083 --> 01:47.207
Hello, wha...
what's going on?

01:47.208 --> 01:48.957
I'm rushing to catch that light.

01:48.958 --> 01:52.792
There's this amazing old bridge
nearby, but I have to hurry.

01:53.250 --> 01:54.125
You have to hurry?

01:55.125 --> 01:56.749
Joy, you know I love that stuff.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.166
Yeah, I know you
love that stuff.

01:58.167 --> 02:00.833
It's my only day off, aren't I
entitled to a little fun?

02:01.208 --> 02:02.167
So you've got your coat?

02:02.168 --> 02:04.124
Yeah, of course I have a jacket.

02:04.125 --> 02:04.726
Alright.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.667
This is England for
crying out loud.

02:07.333 --> 02:09.208
Yeah, of course I
wish you were here.

02:10.250 --> 02:11.833
No, of course I can say it.

02:12.042 --> 02:13.042
I love you too.

02:17.375 --> 02:18.292
Are you there?

02:19.667 --> 02:21.374
Don't forget,
Jenny's gonna call.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.333
What time will she call?

02:22.334 --> 02:23.917
I don't know, around one o'clock
when she gets back.

02:24.167 --> 02:24.917
1:00 a.m.?

02:24.918 --> 02:26.457
What's she doing
out until 1:00 a.m.?

02:26.458 --> 02:27.792
It's her birthday, John!

02:27.958 --> 02:29.207
She's going to go out.

02:29.208 --> 02:30.916
Go to a show, go to a club,

02:30.917 --> 02:31.958
go to a thing.
Joy?

02:32.542 --> 02:34.458
Did you even remember
it's Jenny's birthday?

02:35.000 --> 02:36.457
No, I'm a terrible father.

02:36.458 --> 02:37.375
Of course I remembered!

02:37.376 --> 02:40.167
Just don't let her down!
You promised! Okay?

02:40.500 --> 02:43.249
Yes I'm very aware I forgot
her birthday last year.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.207
Thank you for always
bringing that up.

02:45.208 --> 02:48.417
Forgive me for being so busy
trying to be a godly provider.

02:49.458 --> 02:52.000
J...
Joy! Joy!

02:52.250 --> 02:54.750
Hmmm...
I can't help it!

02:55.792 --> 02:56.625
I tried!

02:56.626 --> 02:58.750
She's the one who
wouldn't talk to me after that.

03:00.417 --> 03:02.457
Yeah, I know she
blames me for everything

03:02.458 --> 03:03.458
and you just allow it.

03:04.833 --> 03:08.333
I told you, I would never
tell her anything about that.

03:09.458 --> 03:10.749
Look, I really have to go.

03:10.750 --> 03:11.708
Alright, well...

03:11.709 --> 03:14.500
Okay.
Alright, Bye bye.

04:26.208 --> 04:27.625
Come on, buddy!

05:03.083 --> 05:03.750
Hey!

05:06.375 --> 05:08.791
Hey! Hey...

05:08.792 --> 05:10.666
Just hang on! Hang on!

05:10.667 --> 05:12.250
Don't let go! Please!

05:13.458 --> 05:16.416
My name is John,
John Palmer. I'm American.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.707
Oh, great!

05:17.708 --> 05:18.458
And you are?

05:18.459 --> 05:19.542
Not interested.

05:20.042 --> 05:22.291
Oh, the British humor thing.

05:22.292 --> 05:24.207
I like it, that's great.

05:24.208 --> 05:25.374
And, and your name?

05:25.375 --> 05:27.291
Well, I'm, I'm, I'm
not telling you that!

05:27.292 --> 05:29.082
Then there's no point.

05:29.083 --> 05:31.166
I, I'd like to know,
I'm interested.

05:31.167 --> 05:34.832
Okay, I'll tell you my name if
you promise to leave me alone.

05:34.833 --> 05:35.583
Come on!

05:36.250 --> 05:38.166
Right, I'm Chris, now go.

05:38.167 --> 05:39.666
Chris.
That's great!

05:39.667 --> 05:41.499
We're off to a great start.

05:41.500 --> 05:44.957
And so now why don't you just
come on down and we can talk.

05:44.958 --> 05:46.832
No! No, no!

05:46.833 --> 05:47.916
I'll come up.

05:47.917 --> 05:49.874
Oh don't, you come up, I jump.

05:49.875 --> 05:51.791
No, no, I don't
want to see that!

05:51.792 --> 05:53.042
I want this!

05:53.333 --> 05:55.999
I, I know you
think you do but...

05:56.000 --> 05:57.207
You don't know what I think!

05:57.208 --> 05:59.541
You've no idea,
you haven't a clue.

05:59.542 --> 06:00.375
So tell me.

06:00.376 --> 06:01.957
There's no point.

06:01.958 --> 06:03.249
I'm listening.

06:03.250 --> 06:05.874
Just five minutes.
I, I want to listen.

06:05.875 --> 06:07.374
There's nothing to say.

06:07.375 --> 06:08.375
I'm gonna climb up.

06:08.375 --> 06:09.167
I'm coming!

06:11.875 --> 06:14.875
Just, how on earth
did you get up here?

06:17.958 --> 06:19.458
Just, hold on!

06:22.208 --> 06:22.667
Ohhh!

06:27.167 --> 06:27.917
Ummpph!

06:30.125 --> 06:31.042
Ughh!

06:36.167 --> 06:37.792
Weather still good up there?

06:38.375 --> 06:39.208
Uhhh!

06:42.000 --> 06:42.958
Mmmm!

06:42.958 --> 06:43.833
Ohhh!

06:43.834 --> 06:45.042
Not now, Joy...

06:46.083 --> 06:47.000
Not now!

06:53.333 --> 06:54.666
Mmmm!

07:10.792 --> 07:13.208
Oh, please, Lord!

07:14.917 --> 07:16.000
I'm coming.

07:17.708 --> 07:18.375
Ughhh!

07:19.417 --> 07:20.393
Mmmmm!

07:20.417 --> 07:21.000
Ohhh!

07:24.500 --> 07:25.250
Hmmmm.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.999
Nggnnnnn! Just wait!

07:37.042 --> 07:40.874
I'm a little afraid of heights.

07:41.958 --> 07:43.416
Oh, oh!

07:43.959 --> 07:47.999
Oh, I, oh, oh.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.417
I'm not going to make it.
I'm not going to make it!

07:54.042 --> 08:07.500
Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah,
um, ah, uh, oh, oh.

08:08.250 --> 08:11.207
Oh, oh, oh, my foot.

08:11.208 --> 08:13.000
Please, help me, Lord.

08:13.792 --> 08:16.458
Help me, Lord!
Ahh!

08:17.125 --> 08:18.417
Ah, come on!

08:20.750 --> 08:21.458
Chris!

08:22.875 --> 08:26.208
Oh, ah, ah, somebody!

08:26.917 --> 08:31.417
Oh, oh, I need
your help, please!

08:31.750 --> 08:32.957
I can't believe it.

08:33.582 --> 08:34.500
Oh, dear Lord!

08:35.500 --> 08:37.207
Please, help me, Lord!

08:37.707 --> 08:39.542
Oh, ah, please!

08:40.332 --> 08:41.226
I can't.

08:41.250 --> 08:41.875
Oh.

08:41.876 --> 08:43.791
I'm not, ah.

08:43.792 --> 08:45.124
Oh, thank you!

08:45.125 --> 08:49.916
Ah, Oh, ah, thank you, Lord!

08:49.917 --> 08:53.291
Ah, Thank you!

08:53.292 --> 08:55.042
Oh, I was going down.

08:55.708 --> 08:58.875
Ah, I was out, it was over.

08:59.083 --> 08:59.667
Great!

08:59.668 --> 09:00.999
I was almost gone.

09:01.000 --> 09:01.458
I'll leave you to it.

09:01.458 --> 09:02.208
I was.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.375
What?

09:05.958 --> 09:07.708
Hey, wait!

09:08.458 --> 09:09.125
Chris!

09:10.042 --> 09:10.917
Chris!

09:12.208 --> 09:14.417
Wait! Just
five minutes.

09:24.333 --> 09:25.667
What about family?

09:29.542 --> 09:31.083
What about your friends?

09:33.542 --> 09:35.125
There has to be someone.

09:35.750 --> 09:36.916
There was someone.

09:42.292 --> 09:43.292
I'm sorry...

09:45.167 --> 09:45.917
What?

09:48.375 --> 09:49.457
It's my wife.

09:50.251 --> 09:56.791
You know how wives can be.

10:08.167 --> 10:10.832
You know,

10:10.833 --> 10:12.582
I believe there's a
purpose to living.

10:12.583 --> 10:14.416
Can I share something with you?

10:14.417 --> 10:15.957
Is that what I think it is?

10:15.958 --> 10:17.249
See I'm a Christian.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.332
Oh, great!

10:18.333 --> 10:19.083
What?

10:19.084 --> 10:20.916
You are joking, aren't you?

10:20.917 --> 10:21.500
No.

10:21.501 --> 10:23.792
Ohh...
Just what I need!

10:24.458 --> 10:26.457
Just let me share this with you.

10:26.458 --> 10:27.874
You're really gonna
do this, aren't you?

10:27.875 --> 10:29.292
Yeah, just listen.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.708
It's in Spanish.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.082
Oh, ha, they write these
things in two languages.

10:39.083 --> 10:40.624
I got the Spanish side.

10:40.625 --> 10:41.708
Here we go.

10:44.625 --> 10:47.374
It says here that there
is a creator of the world

10:47.375 --> 10:49.791
John, chapter one, verse one;

10:49.792 --> 10:51.541
'In the beginning was the Word

10:51.542 --> 10:53.582
'And the Word was with God

10:53.583 --> 10:55.750
and the Word
was God.'

10:58.458 --> 10:59.999
Amen, bro!

11:00.000 --> 11:02.083
I am not your 'bro'.

11:03.333 --> 11:05.250
You really don't have
a clue, do you?

11:06.583 --> 11:08.292
You know about Jesus?

11:15.708 --> 11:16.833
Well, good, well.

11:19.083 --> 11:20.124
Maybe if you listen,

11:20.125 --> 11:22.166
then you'll understand
that there's hope.

11:22.167 --> 11:22.875
Don't!

11:22.876 --> 11:23.957
I, I have to.

11:23.958 --> 11:26.249
You have to understand,
He can save you.

11:26.250 --> 11:28.416
I don't have to
understand anything!

11:28.417 --> 11:30.624
But...
If you just listen,

11:30.625 --> 11:32.333
I mean, What have
you got to lose?

11:34.458 --> 11:39.916
Okay, okay.
Buddy 'bro'!

11:39.917 --> 11:41.208
Give me your best shot.

11:41.708 --> 11:42.833
Give me a gospel.

11:43.958 --> 11:46.625
Tell me your 'good news'
so I can be another

11:46.917 --> 11:48.582
'jewel in your crown', another

11:48.583 --> 11:50.624
'feather in your
witnessing cap'.

11:50.625 --> 11:52.749
So you can go back
to your Megachurch

11:52.750 --> 11:55.791
in Middle America with its
Starbucks in the lobby.

11:55.792 --> 11:57.124
And you can tell everybody

11:57.125 --> 11:59.082
about the poor mixed up Brit

11:59.083 --> 12:02.041
who you led to Jesus
with your tiny little,

12:02.042 --> 12:03.457
scrap of paper,

12:03.458 --> 12:06.000
that you'd forgotten
was written in Spanish!

12:06.542 --> 12:09.208
Yeah, go for it, 'bro'.

12:12.583 --> 12:16.250
Okay, sure, whatever you say.

12:21.792 --> 12:25.207
Well, in the Bible it says,

12:25.208 --> 12:29.167
that, that God made
the world perfect.

12:30.542 --> 12:31.832
And He made man,

12:31.833 --> 12:37.374
and they had a, a perfect
loving relationship together.

12:37.375 --> 12:39.292
That's how it was meant to be.

12:39.958 --> 12:41.832
But then we sinned.

12:41.833 --> 12:44.832
Man did wrong things that,

12:44.833 --> 12:48.292
that broke that
perfect relationship.

12:48.958 --> 12:51.166
But God had a plan.

12:51.167 --> 12:53.041
He sent Jesus,

12:53.042 --> 12:56.457
His one and only begotten Son,

12:56.458 --> 12:59.375
to live as a man
here on this earth.

12:59.958 --> 13:01.542
And He suffered,

13:02.417 --> 13:03.750
died on the cross.

13:04.625 --> 13:08.542
He rose again and
ascended into heaven.

13:09.667 --> 13:10.458
Now,

13:11.917 --> 13:14.208
His death on the cross,

13:14.875 --> 13:18.500
paid the penalty for sin.

13:20.042 --> 13:24.958
If you trust on the Lord Jesus
and ask Him to forgive you.

13:25.750 --> 13:30.292
You will have a brand
new relationship with God.

13:32.292 --> 13:33.958
And everlasting life.

13:35.583 --> 13:36.958
And a friend,

13:38.208 --> 13:39.833
who will never fail you.

13:44.292 --> 13:45.292
So?

13:47.625 --> 13:49.708
What do you think?
It's pretty cool isn't it?

14:24.500 --> 14:25.999
I didn't mean to offend you.

14:26.000 --> 14:26.708
I Just...

14:29.875 --> 14:31.375
I can see you're in need.

14:31.500 --> 14:32.542
Not of religion!

14:34.458 --> 14:38.708
Christianity isn't
religion. It's true faith!

14:39.917 --> 14:41.082
It offers real hope.

14:41.083 --> 14:42.875
And you think I'm
in need of real hope?

14:44.417 --> 14:47.332
You're about to jump off a
bridge for crying out loud!

14:47.333 --> 14:48.624
Yes, and the only
reason I haven't

14:48.625 --> 14:50.416
is because you
won't leave me alone.

14:50.417 --> 14:51.541
Well, that's good isn't it?

14:51.542 --> 14:54.124
No, no it's not good,
it's not good at all!

14:54.125 --> 14:56.499
Anyone would jump off
this bridge rather than

14:56.500 --> 14:57.958
stand here listening to you.

14:58.792 --> 15:00.042
Okay, I get it.

15:00.542 --> 15:02.166
Excuse me!

15:02.167 --> 15:03.999
Why do you Americans
always do this?

15:04.000 --> 15:05.749
You go in when
you're not invited

15:05.750 --> 15:07.416
and you cause
more harm than good.

15:07.417 --> 15:10.125
If I wanted to hear about
your faith, I'd ask you.

15:11.542 --> 15:15.583
Well, I can't not speak about
my faith because it's true.

15:16.542 --> 15:19.916
There is a God.
And He will judge you.

15:19.917 --> 15:22.833
I have to warn you.
I'm, I'm compelled.

15:23.292 --> 15:27.166
By Christ who lives within
me to offer you hope.

15:27.167 --> 15:29.249
Oh, He lives within
you, does He?

15:29.250 --> 15:30.749
You really believe that?

15:30.750 --> 15:34.000
You believe in a divine
Creator of the universe?

15:34.125 --> 15:34.875
Yeah!

15:34.876 --> 15:37.916
And Whose decision to cure evil,

15:37.917 --> 15:41.041
was to come down
and visit our tiny, little,

15:41.042 --> 15:44.249
insignificant, speck of a world?

15:44.250 --> 15:45.582
And have Himself killed?

15:45.583 --> 15:47.292
And then, to cap it all,

15:47.417 --> 15:49.416
to come and live with you?

15:49.417 --> 15:51.457
It's insulting to the universe.

15:51.458 --> 15:53.083
And small minded.

15:53.917 --> 15:54.999
Now you're getting personal.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.083
Well, what do you expect?

15:58.292 --> 16:00.957
Look, I know that
you're in despair

16:00.958 --> 16:02.457
and that there's real hope.

16:02.458 --> 16:03.625
You haven't a clue!

16:05.417 --> 16:07.791
The Bible says in
the Book of Isaiah,

16:07.792 --> 16:11.374
'For I know the
plans I have for you,

16:11.375 --> 16:14.792
'plans for a future and a hope'.

16:17.292 --> 16:18.042
That's funny.

16:19.250 --> 16:19.792
What?

16:21.958 --> 16:24.250
No, I, I, I said it right.

16:25.333 --> 16:26.333
Jeremiah.

16:26.583 --> 16:27.000
What?

16:27.000 --> 16:27.958
It's Jeremiah.

16:28.833 --> 16:29.833
Well, I ehh.

16:29.834 --> 16:32.124
Written in the
6th century B.C.

16:32.125 --> 16:35.417
as a message to the people
of Judah in exile in Babylon.

16:36.958 --> 16:41.333
Wow, okay, impressive!
The man knows his Bible.

16:43.583 --> 16:45.416
But what it says is true.

16:45.417 --> 16:47.208
God brings hope.

16:48.542 --> 16:50.999
Why am I getting
drawn into all this?

16:51.000 --> 16:52.125
Because you care.

16:52.417 --> 16:54.541
It also says, in Jeremiah,

16:54.542 --> 16:56.207
'The Lord has not sent you.

16:56.208 --> 16:58.832
'You persuaded people
to trust in lies.'

16:58.833 --> 17:02.416
It's not lies. You have to
believe on the Lord Jesus.

17:02.417 --> 17:05.582
Philip says, in
Acts, chapter eight,

17:05.583 --> 17:09.374
'If you believe with all your
heart you can be baptized.'

17:09.375 --> 17:12.332
And the Ethiopian
he is with replies,

17:12.333 --> 17:14.665
'I believe that Jesus
is the Son of God.'

17:14.666 --> 17:15.874
That's my point exactly!

17:15.875 --> 17:18.957
But 'believing that
Jesus is the Son of God'

17:18.958 --> 17:21.040
is cut out of most Bibles.

17:21.041 --> 17:24.499
Well, well, I know there's
different translations

17:24.500 --> 17:25.915
and I know that
not all of them...

17:25.916 --> 17:27.249
Do you believe in the Trinity?

17:27.250 --> 17:28.666
Amen, I do!

17:28.667 --> 17:31.791
The Trinity is
only mentioned once

17:31.792 --> 17:33.583
and that's in the
first Epistle of John.

17:34.833 --> 17:35.583
Mmmm.

17:35.584 --> 17:38.041
'For there are three that
bear record in heaven

17:38.042 --> 17:39.582
'and these
three are one.'

17:39.583 --> 17:42.791
And this is cut out of most
manuscripts as well,

17:42.792 --> 17:46.624
which is proof that the
Trinity doesn't exist.

17:46.625 --> 17:48.999
No, no, I, I refuse
to believe that.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.499
But you don't know what
you believe, do you?

17:51.500 --> 17:54.457
So you can quote
the Bible. A bit!

17:54.458 --> 17:56.749
Who cares?
So could I!

17:56.750 --> 17:58.957
But it's just an old story book!

17:58.958 --> 18:02.249
You know we've moved on
and so have human rights.

18:02.250 --> 18:04.707
So I mean how can
you believe in a God

18:04.708 --> 18:07.708
that condones slavery
and stoning to death?

18:13.542 --> 18:14.792
Well that's convenient.

18:16.833 --> 18:19.416
It's my wife for
crying out loud.

18:20.583 --> 18:21.916
You're no different
to the others.

18:30.917 --> 18:33.167
Hey! Hey!
Don't!

18:33.875 --> 18:36.207
Hu, ah.

18:36.208 --> 18:37.292
Ah, oh.

18:37.875 --> 18:38.458
Huh!

18:42.250 --> 18:44.417
Aii, ji, ah, ooo.
Jah!

18:44.958 --> 18:45.458
Jah!

18:47.167 --> 18:48.042
Morning.

18:50.750 --> 18:51.957
This is like a bad joke.

18:51.958 --> 18:52.875
Say nothing.

18:54.500 --> 18:59.624
He's American. Heh...
I'm showing him the sights.

18:59.625 --> 19:01.207
I'm taking pictures.

19:01.208 --> 19:03.542
The view is spectacular.

19:04.333 --> 19:05.832
Yankee Doodle Dandy.

19:05.833 --> 19:06.708
Ha, ha, ha.

19:06.709 --> 19:08.042
Have a nice day!

19:14.333 --> 19:16.916
Have a nice day?
Have a nice day?

19:16.917 --> 19:18.500
Yuh, yuh yoh, yoh!

19:19.042 --> 19:21.750
Ooooi yah!

19:31.833 --> 19:34.000
You do know there are
two sides to every bridge?

19:40.875 --> 19:41.625
Don't!

19:42.042 --> 19:43.000
I have to.

19:43.125 --> 19:44.749
You answer it, I jump.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.957
It's my daughter!
It's her birthday!

19:46.958 --> 19:48.249
So, call her back.

19:48.250 --> 19:51.207
It's, it's late over there.
She's already going to sleep.

19:51.208 --> 19:53.042
It's a phone call!

19:57.583 --> 20:01.208
Thank you very much. Wonderful.
You just wrecked my family.

20:03.667 --> 20:05.167
I promised, man.

20:05.875 --> 20:08.207
What is it with you and
that stupid phone?

20:08.208 --> 20:10.749
If your family can't leave
you alone for one minute,

20:10.750 --> 20:14.917
let alone a few hours or days,
you've got a real problem.

20:17.875 --> 20:19.166
You're right, you're right!

20:19.167 --> 20:21.499
I'll put the phone away.

20:21.500 --> 20:26.041
Uhh, let's just talk
a little bit more.

20:26.042 --> 20:27.333
This can wait.

20:28.375 --> 20:29.542
I'm putting it away.

20:31.917 --> 20:34.166
It's just a
voicemail. I...

20:34.167 --> 20:35.457
I'll check it later.

20:35.458 --> 20:37.166
Puttin' the phone away.

20:39.458 --> 20:41.124
It's my wife, can I?

20:41.125 --> 20:42.208
Give me the phone!

20:44.667 --> 20:47.083
Give me the phone or I jump.

20:54.750 --> 20:55.875
Give me the phone!

21:03.208 --> 21:06.207
Wonderful, you just
ruined my life.

21:06.208 --> 21:07.625
I may as well jump too.

21:24.833 --> 21:27.167
Right, now it's my turn.

21:28.083 --> 21:29.916
What's that supposed to mean?

21:29.917 --> 21:31.416
Well, so far it's
all been about you.

21:31.417 --> 21:32.333
Oh, right.

21:32.334 --> 21:36.416
Now it's my turn to speak and
all you have to do is listen.

21:36.417 --> 21:39.707
Whatever you say I got all the
time in the world now, buddy.

21:39.708 --> 21:42.916
My wife's probably throwing my
stuff out the front door

21:42.917 --> 21:43.750
as we speak.

21:47.958 --> 21:49.583
I used to be a pastor.

21:50.792 --> 21:52.791
And I used to be Santa Claus.

21:52.792 --> 21:54.583
Or is it Father Christmas?

21:57.208 --> 21:59.832
I used to believe in all the
things that you talked about,

21:59.833 --> 22:02.624
but then, I came to my senses.

22:02.625 --> 22:04.791
Yeah, well, maybe
you didn't truly believe

22:04.792 --> 22:05.667
in the first place.

22:05.668 --> 22:08.207
Oh, I believed,
I believed alright.

22:08.208 --> 22:10.457
And then I realized that
Christianity

22:10.458 --> 22:13.874
is a bigoted and
misinformed religion.

22:13.875 --> 22:15.249
Blah, blah, blah.

22:15.250 --> 22:18.041
Yes, and your genuine
lack of care, Jim.

22:18.042 --> 22:18.917
It's 'John'.

22:18.918 --> 22:23.041
Is living proof of
Christianity's hypocrisy.

22:23.042 --> 22:25.166
You know you tried
to give me hope with

22:25.167 --> 22:27.832
happy, clappy, cliches,

22:27.833 --> 22:31.666
that you learned at
some evangelical seminar.

22:31.667 --> 22:34.832
But right here, right now,
a suicidal man

22:34.833 --> 22:36.207
just wants someone to listen

22:36.208 --> 22:39.542
and the best you can come
up with is, 'Blah, blah, blah.'

22:39.833 --> 22:42.333
Alright, I'm listening.

22:45.375 --> 22:46.792
Were you really a pastor?

22:48.333 --> 22:50.875
For ten years I
was pastor of a church.

22:52.292 --> 22:53.250
Wow!

22:53.500 --> 22:57.291
It was an old, evangelical
church in Liverpool.

22:57.292 --> 23:01.999
You know, the Liver birds,
football, The Beatles.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.333
I got that one.

23:05.042 --> 23:09.374
It was only a small
church. Forty members.

23:09.375 --> 23:11.999
A joke by your
American standards.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.333
And they were all, misfits.

23:15.917 --> 23:20.583
But somehow I believed
it all, I was drawn in.

23:22.667 --> 23:24.667
I think I was too
frightened to question it.

23:27.375 --> 23:28.958
What made you change your mind?

23:32.167 --> 23:33.542
My wife died.

23:38.125 --> 23:44.624
You know, sometimes grief
can hurt a guy so deeply

23:44.625 --> 23:46.499
that he blames it all on God.

23:46.500 --> 23:47.667
No, don't.

23:49.958 --> 23:51.375
You have no idea.

23:52.917 --> 23:53.750
So tell me.

23:58.125 --> 23:59.791
She'll be sorely missed, pastor.

23:59.792 --> 24:03.125
But we can rejoice knowing that
she's with the Lord in heaven.

24:03.667 --> 24:05.958
Carol was well
loved by everybody.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.249
That's okay. Just ignore it.

24:17.958 --> 24:19.249
How are you holding up, pastor?

24:19.250 --> 24:22.208
It's been a pretty good
turnout, don't you think?

24:26.917 --> 24:28.332
Is there something you
want to show me?

24:28.333 --> 24:31.332
Oh this? Uhm,
well, it can wait.

24:31.333 --> 24:34.458
It's just the ahh, the estimate
for the church repairs.

24:39.458 --> 24:41.792
Here, I'll sign it.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.333
Actually it is rather
important. Thank you!

24:45.500 --> 24:48.125
Life goes on, so to speak.

25:05.917 --> 25:07.167
I was free.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.167
That's tragic.

25:09.792 --> 25:11.833
I hated them all
and I walked away.

25:12.875 --> 25:13.625
Then what?

25:14.208 --> 25:16.499
Then I finally
stopped feeling guilty,

25:16.500 --> 25:18.291
realized that God didn't exist.

25:18.292 --> 25:21.958
For the first time in my
life felt, truly free.

25:25.083 --> 25:26.582
What happened to your church?

25:26.583 --> 25:29.207
Gone. Closed a
couple of years later.

25:29.208 --> 25:30.625
There's a housing
estate there now.

25:35.708 --> 25:38.417
Well, I know in my
heart that God does exist.

25:42.750 --> 25:43.625
So did I!

25:48.750 --> 25:50.083
So did I.

25:59.167 --> 26:00.917
It's not the way I'd want to go.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.291
Are you sure this is
high enough to do the job?

26:06.292 --> 26:09.708
Mmm, anything over seventy five
feet is high enough. Mmm.

26:11.667 --> 26:12.958
What if you hit the water?

26:13.875 --> 26:14.957
I'll aim for the ground.

26:14.958 --> 26:19.458
Oh, that's tough. You'd
have to really swing wide.

26:20.917 --> 26:21.583
I'll manage.

26:21.584 --> 26:23.083
Mm hmm.

26:24.292 --> 26:28.583
Honestly, I'm not convinced this
is high enough to do the job.

26:29.542 --> 26:30.624
I checked on the Internet.

26:30.625 --> 26:34.791
It says anything over
seventy-five feet is fatal.

26:34.792 --> 26:36.625
Seventy five feet, huh?

26:38.542 --> 26:42.750
Wow, that's over two seconds
before you hit the ground.

26:44.917 --> 26:45.875
What?

26:46.583 --> 26:48.374
You'll be falling for
more than two seconds.

26:48.375 --> 26:50.291
The acceleration in
gravity is equal to

26:50.292 --> 26:52.000
thirty two feet per
second squared.

26:54.667 --> 26:55.625
Right!

26:57.542 --> 26:58.624
Wait!

26:58.625 --> 27:02.666
Did you say thirty two feet
per second squared?

27:02.667 --> 27:05.000
Isn't that thirty two
times thirty two?

27:05.708 --> 27:06.708
Sort of.

27:07.125 --> 27:09.791
You fall about sixteen
feet in that first second

27:09.792 --> 27:11.707
because you're accelerating
from zero to

27:11.708 --> 27:14.207
thirty two feet per
second in that first second.

27:14.208 --> 27:17.332
You'd accelerate to
sixty four feet per second

27:17.333 --> 27:18.624
in the second second.

27:18.625 --> 27:20.749
And for a short
time your distance

27:20.750 --> 27:23.208
would match your
velocity at sixty four feet.

27:25.833 --> 27:27.208
How do you know that?

27:28.042 --> 27:30.332
Surprise, surprise,
I'm an engineer.

27:30.333 --> 27:32.333
I've taken my fair
share of physics.

27:34.250 --> 27:35.542
What if I went head first?

27:38.208 --> 27:39.875
Well, you'd
definitely hurt yourself.

27:40.875 --> 27:43.458
But what if you flipped
over and landed feet first?

28:22.083 --> 28:23.333
I think it's going to rain.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.041
This is England,
it always rains.

28:26.042 --> 28:27.083
It was sunny this morning.

28:29.500 --> 28:31.332
You guys are always
talking about the weather.

28:31.333 --> 28:32.707
Are you stereotyping?

28:32.708 --> 28:34.374
No, I just noticed it.

28:34.375 --> 28:37.042
It's called polite conversation.

28:37.250 --> 28:38.416
Oh, oh!

28:38.417 --> 28:41.249
I believe it might rain old boy.

28:41.250 --> 28:43.082
I could murder a cup of tea,

28:43.083 --> 28:43.792
ta, ta!

28:43.793 --> 28:45.125
At least we're not rude!

28:45.625 --> 28:47.541
And all Americans are rude?

28:47.542 --> 28:53.125
Well, loud, brash, in
your face and, yeah, rude.

28:54.250 --> 28:56.082
Then of course
there's that whole

28:56.083 --> 28:58.166
eating in your car phenomenon.

28:58.167 --> 29:02.749
Burgers, hot dogs, doughnuts,
all washed down with a

29:02.750 --> 29:04.874
drive-thru mega-bucket.

29:04.875 --> 29:08.874
What a fantastic contribution to
world cuisine that is!

29:08.875 --> 29:10.874
Speaking of which,
because of you I

29:10.875 --> 29:12.458
missed my breakfast
this morning.

29:14.792 --> 29:16.000
Don't let me keep you.

29:19.917 --> 29:21.999
You know when you
die it's not the end.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.042
You believe in hell?

29:24.083 --> 29:26.749
Yes, but you don't.

29:26.750 --> 29:28.582
Oh I do, I do.
Believe me.

29:28.583 --> 29:30.832
This is hell, right
here, right now.

29:30.833 --> 29:32.208
It doesn't get any
worse than this.

29:33.042 --> 29:35.291
When I die it ends.

29:35.292 --> 29:38.707
The pain, the suffering,
the heartache.

29:38.708 --> 29:44.083
Snuffed out in a single
moment. Hmm, glorious!

29:44.583 --> 29:46.082
Now you see if there
really was a God,

29:46.083 --> 29:48.332
that would be the one
thing He got right.

29:48.333 --> 29:52.792
That really is the peace that
surpasses all understanding.

29:54.292 --> 29:58.667
Peace, lasting peace.

30:05.542 --> 30:07.417
Live life and be happy.

30:08.500 --> 30:11.750
And if you can't, die
quickly and be done.

30:13.042 --> 30:14.707
That is so empty, man.

30:14.708 --> 30:16.832
Well of course it's empty!

30:16.833 --> 30:20.332
But you've never had to face the
fear of an empty existence.

30:20.333 --> 30:22.666
You've always run away from it.

30:22.667 --> 30:25.082
My God delivers
me from all my fears.

30:25.083 --> 30:25.667
Oh, does he?

30:25.668 --> 30:27.666
He gives me true peace.

30:27.667 --> 30:28.292
Does he?

30:28.917 --> 30:30.916
Well let's just talk
about that shall we?

30:30.917 --> 30:34.666
So let's find out how He
works for you shall we?

30:34.667 --> 30:36.707
Tell me about the
relationship with your family.

30:36.708 --> 30:39.042
It was great until this morning.

30:40.750 --> 30:43.999
Joy is a good wife.
I love my daughter too.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.749
Oh, come on, you sound just like

30:45.750 --> 30:48.041
one of the congregation
from my old church.

30:48.042 --> 30:49.500
Be honest, John.

30:50.417 --> 30:52.851
Every family has its problems.

30:52.875 --> 30:53.792
Well of course.

30:53.793 --> 30:56.624
But what difference does
your faith in God make?

30:56.625 --> 30:57.500
None!

30:57.917 --> 31:01.082
Faith isn't a free pass
from pain and problems.

31:01.083 --> 31:04.041
Sometimes my faith is the only
reason I can carry on.

31:04.042 --> 31:05.791
Well, don't tell me
you've considered suicide.

31:05.792 --> 31:07.458
No!
Never!

31:07.917 --> 31:11.791
I mean carry on with my
work, my church, my family.

31:11.792 --> 31:12.792
Your family?

31:13.542 --> 31:16.666
Ahh! I told you your
perfect Christian family

31:16.667 --> 31:17.667
was too good to be true.

31:17.668 --> 31:19.667
I never used the word 'perfect'.

31:21.083 --> 31:22.167
Your wife doesn't trust you.

31:22.500 --> 31:26.124
That is a laugh, man.

31:26.125 --> 31:27.874
Phoning you every five minutes.

31:27.875 --> 31:28.417
So?

31:28.417 --> 31:28.958
So.

31:29.875 --> 31:32.582
So all those trips away have
taken their toll, John.

31:32.583 --> 31:33.625
She doesn't trust you.

31:36.417 --> 31:38.291
It's personal.

31:38.292 --> 31:40.042
Well cheating often is.

31:40.792 --> 31:42.582
You're way out
of line my friend.

31:42.583 --> 31:45.791
Well, that's not very
Christian, is it, hmm?

31:45.792 --> 31:48.166
You cheated on your
wife didn't you, John.

31:48.167 --> 31:49.791
I've never cheated on my wife.

31:49.792 --> 31:52.625
Oh, come on, you wouldn't be the
first guy in the world.

31:57.167 --> 31:58.000
Let me take that!

31:58.000 --> 31:58.542
No.

31:58.543 --> 31:59.582
I promise.
No, no.

31:59.583 --> 32:00.874
I won't tell her
a thing about you.

32:00.875 --> 32:01.542
No!

32:01.543 --> 32:03.957
I, I, I promise, on
everything I believe in.

32:03.958 --> 32:05.583
Just, please!

32:07.875 --> 32:09.083
Thank you!

32:10.208 --> 32:12.041
Oh, there you are.

32:12.042 --> 32:13.291
Thank you, Lord!

32:13.292 --> 32:14.292
Hi, Joy.

32:14.293 --> 32:16.541
Hi, how come you
didn't pick up earlier?

32:16.542 --> 32:18.207
I, I, I'm sorry, honey.

32:18.208 --> 32:19.999
I just, I just wasn't able to.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.457
So what are you up to?

32:21.458 --> 32:25.333
I, I'm, I'm on that
bridge I told you about.

32:25.958 --> 32:28.249
It's late here, Jenny
said that she tried calling

32:28.250 --> 32:29.083
and you didn't pick up.

32:29.084 --> 32:30.291
I know, I know,

32:30.292 --> 32:33.041
I promise as soon as
we hang up I'll call her.

32:33.042 --> 32:34.082
Is there someone there with you?

32:34.083 --> 32:37.417
I, I told you,
I'm on that bridge.

32:38.500 --> 32:40.291
You know, there's
something going on here,

32:40.292 --> 32:41.292
There's something between us.

32:42.208 --> 32:43.375
Do you love me?

32:44.042 --> 32:46.249
Look, Joy, this
isn't the right time.

32:46.250 --> 32:47.208
Why do you love me?

32:47.208 --> 32:47.875
I...

32:49.292 --> 32:51.792
Hello, can you answer me?

32:54.917 --> 32:56.249
Because I choose to.

32:56.250 --> 32:57.167
You choose to?

32:59.583 --> 33:02.457
We're Married, Joy. I'm
committed to you.

33:02.458 --> 33:04.999
I, I love you!
Truly I do.

33:05.000 --> 33:05.833
Now will you, please?

33:05.834 --> 33:08.749
I, I think I really
need to call Jenny.

33:08.750 --> 33:11.957
Yeah, make sure you do,
you know, we are losing her.

33:11.958 --> 33:14.374
I, eh, and when did that begin?

33:14.375 --> 33:15.707
You blame me for
this, don't you?

33:15.708 --> 33:17.749
No! I'm just saying
the way it is.

33:17.750 --> 33:19.957
What, you're gonna
blame me for it now? I mean...

33:19.958 --> 33:20.250
I...

33:20.250 --> 33:21.208
Long distance?

33:21.875 --> 33:23.041
Are you there?
Joy?

33:23.042 --> 33:24.832
Ah, we're breaking up.
You blame me for this,

33:24.833 --> 33:25.542
Don't you.

33:26.667 --> 33:28.707
Can you hear me?
Joy?

33:28.708 --> 33:33.332
Quit being so mean!

33:33.333 --> 33:35.625
You said you cared!

33:36.375 --> 33:38.499
Hey, I'm not the bad guy here!

33:38.500 --> 33:40.791
Since when am I the bad guy?

33:40.792 --> 33:44.582
I do care! I care about you,
I care about Jenny!

33:44.583 --> 33:47.291
I care about every single thing!

33:47.292 --> 33:49.999
I care about you.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.957
The truth is, if not for you,

33:51.958 --> 33:54.582
everything would
be fine and happy.

33:54.583 --> 33:55.832
You know what,
don't be so cruel.

33:55.833 --> 33:57.291
I'm cruel?

33:57.292 --> 33:59.791
I'm the guy who's
trying to fix everything.

33:59.792 --> 34:00.708
I'm sorry,

34:00.709 --> 34:02.832
I've said I'm sorry.
It's too late to be sorry.

34:02.833 --> 34:05.832
You cheated on me! And
every time you look at me,

34:05.833 --> 34:09.123
like everything's supposed to be
normal, I got to deal with that.

34:09.125 --> 34:11.416
Every time I look across
the church and there he is

34:11.417 --> 34:14.081
all hallelujah, I got
to deal with that.

34:14.083 --> 34:14.917
Every time you go,

34:14.918 --> 34:17.291
'Oh, honey, I'm cold,
put your arm around me.'

34:17.292 --> 34:19.291
I gotta think about
his arms around you.

34:19.292 --> 34:21.666
I'm sorry, okay?
You have no idea, man.

34:21.667 --> 34:25.375
How do you think
it feels to me? John?

34:26.250 --> 34:29.456
Joy? Hello?
Umm, I'm Chris.

34:29.458 --> 34:31.081
What?
We've not spoken before.

34:31.083 --> 34:34.791
Ahh, John's a bit busy at the
moment, he'll call you back.

34:34.792 --> 34:36.375
Or maybe he won't...

34:37.167 --> 34:38.125
Bye.

34:45.208 --> 34:47.291
She cheated on me.

35:04.208 --> 35:05.000
(JOHN SIGHS

35:17.083 --> 35:22.833
Help me, how
am I gonna tell him?

35:25.750 --> 35:27.625
Tell me what to say.

35:31.042 --> 35:33.457
I don't know what to do now.

35:36.208 --> 35:43.083
Good job, Joy! Good job!
You are so messed up!

35:44.833 --> 35:47.333
He's never gonna forgive me.

35:48.375 --> 35:50.625
Not worth it.

35:57.708 --> 35:59.292
Joy, are you okay?

36:02.250 --> 36:04.375
Said it was just three weeks.

36:08.668 --> 36:10.292
Well, it had to be
one way or the other.

36:11.625 --> 36:14.416
Said she was lonely
because I'm away so much.

36:14.417 --> 36:16.208
It's natural.

36:16.917 --> 36:19.707
A lot of marriages end that way.

36:19.708 --> 36:21.042
Let me just answer that.

36:33.167 --> 36:36.249
John? John!

36:36.250 --> 36:36.917
What?

36:38.833 --> 36:40.624
Do you want to know what I'd do?

36:40.625 --> 36:43.082
No, I don't want to
know what you'd do.

36:43.083 --> 36:44.374
Well, let me tell you.

36:45.542 --> 36:46.292
John,

36:47.875 --> 36:48.750
I'd do this.

36:55.417 --> 36:58.124
Why would you do that?

36:58.125 --> 37:00.833
I really don't think you
were helping each other.

37:03.542 --> 37:04.708
We were going to make it.

37:06.042 --> 37:07.875
I had promises from God.

37:08.958 --> 37:11.750
We're gonna work
through everything.

37:12.333 --> 37:14.457
Perhaps, you should change jobs.

37:14.458 --> 37:15.750
No, It's...

37:16.542 --> 37:18.542
Runs deeper than that.

37:20.542 --> 37:22.416
Why don't you
admit you hate her?

37:22.417 --> 37:23.666
No!

37:23.667 --> 37:26.082
I'll never speak those words.

37:26.083 --> 37:28.667
I love my wife, I love her.

37:31.250 --> 37:32.833
You're such a rubbish liar.

37:34.458 --> 37:36.250
I don't hate my wife.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.042
All I ever do is try hard and

37:42.208 --> 37:46.458
try to do the right thing
and make sacrifices.

37:47.667 --> 37:49.249
She does this to me.

37:49.250 --> 37:50.583
So you must
hate her a little bit.

37:50.958 --> 37:51.875
No!

37:55.083 --> 37:57.124
I admit there's times
when I struggle.

37:57.125 --> 38:00.542
Hmm, 'struggle'. Another
great Christian word.

38:00.833 --> 38:02.541
There's days when
I'm angry, that's for sure!

38:02.542 --> 38:03.250
What at him?

38:03.750 --> 38:04.999
Especially at him.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.167
You mean the other guy.

38:06.708 --> 38:09.041
Is there another him? Don't tell
me there's another him.

38:09.042 --> 38:12.041
Hmm. Finally some honesty!

38:12.042 --> 38:14.625
I'm not perfect but I sure
didn't deserve that.

38:17.083 --> 38:18.542
So why don't you divorce her?

38:19.542 --> 38:21.124
God hates divorce.

38:21.125 --> 38:22.542
But he tolerates fools.

38:27.042 --> 38:30.375
I have to love my wife, I have
to forgive her and love her.

38:31.042 --> 38:33.917
You have to? Why? Because
some pastor told you to?

38:38.625 --> 38:39.542
Okay, you're right.

38:39.543 --> 38:41.791
Sometimes I...

38:41.792 --> 38:43.292
...feel like
I hate her.

38:47.333 --> 38:52.249
You know, like there's
no one I can turn to.

38:52.250 --> 38:56.124
It's like, if I just
said to people,

38:56.125 --> 38:58.833
'I'm angry.' Like,
they'll scatter.

39:00.958 --> 39:03.999
As long as I keep that
hallelujah smile going, oh,

39:04.000 --> 39:05.167
everything's okay!

39:07.667 --> 39:09.375
John, how was your trip?

39:09.708 --> 39:11.541
Yeah, it went well.

39:11.542 --> 39:12.582
Did you miss him?

39:12.583 --> 39:15.667
It wasn't so bad,
but I'm glad he's home.

39:16.083 --> 39:17.833
I tell you, so good to see you.

39:25.708 --> 39:29.833
You know, I never
told anyone this.

39:32.208 --> 39:34.500
My father cheated on my mother.

39:37.875 --> 39:40.082
I'll never forget the
day he left us. He...

39:40.083 --> 39:41.582
I'm just this little boy.

39:41.583 --> 39:47.042
He bends down and he says,
'Someday you'll understand.'

39:47.917 --> 39:50.499
Well, you know, I
don't understand.

39:50.500 --> 39:53.083
He was selfish!

39:53.625 --> 39:55.875
He left me and
he left my mother.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.167
I'll never do that to my family.

40:03.083 --> 40:05.375
I wish I could erase
the pain, but...

40:09.458 --> 40:11.500
The pain will never go away.

40:15.208 --> 40:17.667
He's always focused on
something other than me.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.250
And I suppose you were focused
on me when you were, uhh...

40:24.750 --> 40:26.125
with freckle face.

40:29.583 --> 40:32.000
See, he always does that.

40:32.333 --> 40:35.375
Am I wrong?
Tell me I'm wrong.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.708
John, I love you.

40:46.083 --> 40:47.875
I love you, too.

40:49.333 --> 40:50.292
Divorce her.

40:51.708 --> 40:52.542
What?

40:53.583 --> 40:54.250
Get rid of her.

40:56.292 --> 40:57.601
What about my daughter?

40:57.625 --> 40:59.124
Come on, she'll get over it.

40:59.125 --> 41:01.125
Huh! You don't
know my daughter.

41:02.667 --> 41:04.999
If she had any idea
what her mom did,

41:05.000 --> 41:07.458
oooo, it would just kill her.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.082
No, this is not an accident.

41:10.083 --> 41:11.791
You're doing it
on purpose, John,

41:11.792 --> 41:14.458
you keep coming back to the
same place every single time.

41:14.792 --> 41:15.750
How about me?

41:15.751 --> 41:17.791
Come on! Can you give
me a little bit of affection?

41:17.792 --> 41:18.542
Just a little bit?

41:18.667 --> 41:20.332
I'm still here, aren't I.

41:20.333 --> 41:22.749
You're here?
You're here? That's it?

41:22.750 --> 41:25.499
No, you're not here!
You're not here!

41:25.500 --> 41:27.791
Do you want me
to go? I'll go!

41:27.792 --> 41:29.667
Dad! Just stop!

41:32.958 --> 41:35.083
You act like you hate her.

41:35.792 --> 41:37.917
Jenny, there are things that...

41:38.208 --> 41:39.583
are you going to
help me with her?

41:39.833 --> 41:42.167
Jenny's been avoiding
me for weeks now.

41:43.458 --> 41:47.457
The truth is my life is a lie.

41:47.458 --> 41:49.792
Some witness for Christ, I am.

42:01.542 --> 42:02.333
Read this.

42:05.167 --> 42:06.417
What's this?

42:06.792 --> 42:07.625
Read it.

42:16.208 --> 42:17.375
Dear Chloe,

42:19.667 --> 42:21.542
I'm sorry I've let you down.

42:22.500 --> 42:26.333
And I hope that one day you,
you'll be able to forgive me.

42:27.708 --> 42:31.083
I'm sure in time
you'll learn to cope.

42:32.083 --> 42:33.000
I miss you.

42:34.042 --> 42:38.875
You're a wonderful daughter and
I'm sorry we've moved apart.

42:40.292 --> 42:42.292
I should have spent
more time with you,

42:43.625 --> 42:48.958
more time listening. Yes, I
really should have listened.

42:50.333 --> 42:53.042
I'm sorry I haven't
been there for you

42:54.417 --> 42:57.708
and I do understand
how I upset you so deeply.

43:01.500 --> 43:04.208
I miss your mum so much!

43:05.375 --> 43:07.083
I hope you find happiness.

43:08.208 --> 43:10.958
Live life and be free.

43:11.875 --> 43:16.458
Enjoy what you've got every
second of every day.

43:17.167 --> 43:19.208
I am sorry, truly.

43:21.417 --> 43:23.874
Goodbye.

43:23.875 --> 43:30.000
With love, always, Dad.

43:34.625 --> 43:39.375
Well, that's,
that's some letter.

43:41.958 --> 43:43.624
I can't stay!

43:43.625 --> 43:44.666
Why not, Chloe?

43:44.667 --> 43:47.124
I can't live like this.
We're different!

43:47.125 --> 43:48.499
I know we're different.
Look, Mum,

43:48.500 --> 43:49.957
I understand what you believe,

43:49.958 --> 43:51.499
but I am not a Christian!

43:51.500 --> 43:52.749
Perhaps not now,

43:52.750 --> 43:54.666
but give it time and you
might change your mind.

43:54.667 --> 43:55.542
Don't, Mum!

43:55.543 --> 43:56.582
Chloe, listen!

43:56.583 --> 43:59.041
No! You don't
listen to anyone!

43:59.042 --> 44:01.291
At least not anyone who
thinks differently to you.

44:01.292 --> 44:03.457
Chloe, please let's talk.
Just five minutes.

44:03.458 --> 44:05.124
There is nothing else to say.

44:05.125 --> 44:06.083
Wait!

44:07.000 --> 44:08.417
I need to tell you something.

44:08.750 --> 44:10.042
No, Chris don't.

44:11.000 --> 44:11.875
What?

44:18.125 --> 44:19.333
Your mum has cancer.

44:37.833 --> 44:40.167
You know Chloe didn't come
to her mother's funeral?

44:41.375 --> 44:42.832
Well, we all make bad decisions.

44:42.833 --> 44:45.249
You can't blame God for that.

44:45.250 --> 44:47.750
Cancer is hardly a bad decision!

44:53.917 --> 44:54.708
You were right.

44:54.709 --> 44:56.458
Yay, finally!

44:57.333 --> 44:58.666
No, I'm talking
about the weather.

44:58.667 --> 45:00.125
You said it was
going to start raining.

45:00.875 --> 45:02.708
Oh, wow, my camera!

45:03.083 --> 45:05.250
Oh, go get it quick,
before it gets ruined.

45:08.167 --> 45:09.541
I'm not that stupid.

45:09.542 --> 45:11.625
You cover it up well.

45:15.417 --> 45:17.708
You know, don't
blame God for my pain.

45:18.458 --> 45:19.333
I can't.

45:19.334 --> 45:20.957
I don't believe in God.

45:20.958 --> 45:22.625
God gets us through our pain.

45:23.333 --> 45:25.374
Fairytales get us
through our pain,

45:25.375 --> 45:26.749
drugs get us through our pain,

45:26.750 --> 45:28.332
the occasional large whiskey

45:28.333 --> 45:30.583
has often helped me
get through my pain.

45:31.417 --> 45:32.417
Pleasurable ladies

45:32.418 --> 45:34.250
have often kept...
Oh, okay, enough.

45:34.625 --> 45:35.375
Enough!

45:39.750 --> 45:41.542
I know that God loves me.

45:41.958 --> 45:42.500
How?

45:43.417 --> 45:44.417
How do you know?

45:46.542 --> 45:50.542
Er, love is a wonderful
thing, if you can find it!

45:51.667 --> 45:54.542
But when it's over, it's over.

45:56.375 --> 45:59.833
You see people
die or betray you,

46:01.625 --> 46:02.542
and then what?

46:04.125 --> 46:05.208
We're left alone.

46:07.750 --> 46:09.457
You'd have me abandon all hope.

46:09.458 --> 46:10.582
All false hope.

46:10.583 --> 46:13.166
So how can you really know God?

46:13.167 --> 46:14.749
You've never heard
Him speak, have you?

46:14.750 --> 46:16.500
No, not directly.

46:16.833 --> 46:19.499
Good, ha, because if
you start telling people

46:19.500 --> 46:21.957
you're hearing voices,
they'll lock you up.

46:21.958 --> 46:24.457
If they see me standing
on this bridge in the rain,

46:24.458 --> 46:25.292
they'll lock me up.

46:34.708 --> 46:36.875
Why don't you
try contacting Chloe?

46:37.542 --> 46:39.457
You really think I'd
be standing here,

46:39.458 --> 46:40.791
waiting for you to leave,

46:40.792 --> 46:42.375
if I hadn't tried that already?

46:44.333 --> 46:45.999
You really love her, don't you?

46:46.000 --> 46:47.707
She has no interest in me.

46:47.708 --> 46:52.750
She's just as selfish
and obstinate as I am.

46:52.958 --> 46:53.875
You're not,

46:54.417 --> 46:56.957
well, selfish.

46:56.958 --> 46:58.874
She hates me.

46:58.875 --> 47:01.374
You're her daddy, she loves you.

47:01.375 --> 47:04.666
But we haven't
spoken in two years.

47:04.667 --> 47:06.416
There's no time
like the present.

47:06.417 --> 47:07.250
No.

47:08.958 --> 47:13.250
Hello Chloe, this
is your daddy calling.

47:14.792 --> 47:16.875
I've missed you so much,

47:18.000 --> 47:20.749
I know I haven't handled
everything very well,

47:20.750 --> 47:24.542
but you're a wonderful daughter.

47:25.583 --> 47:26.792
I love you.

47:28.083 --> 47:29.916
I know I need to listen more.

47:29.917 --> 47:30.625
Okay, enough!

47:33.292 --> 47:34.791
Just give it a try.

47:34.792 --> 47:35.667
No!

47:35.668 --> 47:38.749
The time is now,
Chris, now is the time.

47:38.750 --> 47:40.583
You're right, now is the time.

47:41.833 --> 47:43.125
I need to get higher!

47:44.542 --> 47:45.292
Wha?

47:49.208 --> 47:51.374
Chris, Chloe needs you.

47:51.375 --> 47:52.957
I know she's angry, but,

47:52.958 --> 47:55.582
but she needs you,
man, I just know it.

47:55.583 --> 47:56.917
What do you know?

47:58.167 --> 47:59.750
Go back home!

48:00.250 --> 48:01.917
Go and save your marriage.

48:02.292 --> 48:04.291
I bet she cries herself to sleep

48:04.292 --> 48:07.250
every night because of her
mom and because of you.

48:07.458 --> 48:09.042
I see what you're trying to do.

48:10.083 --> 48:12.457
You're trying to distract
me and it won't work.

48:12.458 --> 48:15.082
We were doing so good down here.

48:15.083 --> 48:17.416
I'm more likely to die up here.

48:17.417 --> 48:19.416
Ha, you told me that yourself.

48:19.417 --> 48:21.457
You're the one
who's in control here.

48:21.458 --> 48:23.416
So just a few more minutes.

48:23.417 --> 48:25.792
No! No, John, I'm done.

48:38.917 --> 48:42.458
Ah, uh, I just,

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Oh! Ah!

48:48.667 --> 48:54.292
Oh wow, I, woo ha!

48:54.792 --> 48:57.874
Huh!

48:57.875 --> 48:59.791
Fist bump, man.

48:59.792 --> 49:03.291
Come on 'bro', come on!

49:03.292 --> 49:05.083
Give me a good one!

49:12.417 --> 49:13.250
Gotcha!

49:13.251 --> 49:15.916
Ha ha, where you
going to go now?

49:15.917 --> 49:18.041
Well, how about
this for a fist bump?

49:18.042 --> 49:19.250
Ooo.

49:24.958 --> 49:27.291
It's like the worst
day of my life.

49:27.292 --> 49:28.625
Like the worst day?

49:29.542 --> 49:30.792
Put your head back.

49:36.042 --> 49:38.041
You'd think a guy be
entitled to a breakfast

49:38.042 --> 49:40.000
on the worst day of
his life, but no!

49:45.083 --> 49:46.999
Why do you keep
checking your watch?

49:47.000 --> 49:50.041
The alarm set for the same time
she took her last breath.

49:50.042 --> 49:52.542
When it goes off, I jump.

49:53.708 --> 49:55.042
Whether you're with me or not.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.333
What time would that be?

50:05.833 --> 50:08.792
Let's leave that
as a surprise, shall we?

50:12.125 --> 50:13.542
That'd be murder, you know?

50:13.833 --> 50:14.833
Sue me!

50:15.167 --> 50:16.625
You're a very funny guy.

50:17.167 --> 50:18.417
Then untie me.

50:20.292 --> 50:21.292
No.

50:22.792 --> 50:24.333
So it's your choice.

50:54.875 --> 50:56.083
Do you want a mint?

51:03.833 --> 51:06.292
Mmm, lovely!

51:12.875 --> 51:13.333
So,

51:14.375 --> 51:15.667
why are you here?

51:17.000 --> 51:18.958
I think I'm here
because God sent me.

51:21.875 --> 51:24.042
Hey, I love the
way the Lord works!

51:26.208 --> 51:30.082
No, I mean why are you
here, you know, in the UK?

51:30.083 --> 51:32.666
Oh, I'm on a work assignment.

51:32.667 --> 51:34.666
I had a day off today.

51:34.667 --> 51:37.624
I like to photograph
old bridges and buildings.

51:37.625 --> 51:39.292
It's just a hobby of mine.

51:40.333 --> 51:42.000
You know, this is
a famous bridge?

51:43.125 --> 51:45.874
It's one of the last remaining
wooden truss bridges

51:45.875 --> 51:46.917
in all of England.

51:48.208 --> 51:51.875
It was built by this
eccentric old American guy.

51:52.333 --> 51:54.333
He settled here in England.

51:55.333 --> 51:57.499
He just wanted
to build a bridge.

51:57.500 --> 51:58.042
It's funny.

51:58.043 --> 52:02.166
There's no meaning, there's no
purpose, it doesn't do anything.

52:02.167 --> 52:03.875
You guys would
call it a 'folly'.

52:06.042 --> 52:07.083
Pointless.

52:10.250 --> 52:12.292
It's my hobby, I don't know.

52:13.458 --> 52:16.000
Everybody has hobbies.
Do you have a hobby?

52:18.958 --> 52:20.417
Bad question.

52:24.042 --> 52:27.624
Shouldn't you really be
out preaching the gospel,

52:27.625 --> 52:30.917
rather than taking
pictures of old bridges?

52:31.667 --> 52:32.875
Probably, yeah.

52:34.125 --> 52:36.292
I don't know, it's
just a hobby of mine.

52:39.417 --> 52:40.750
Truth be told,

52:42.167 --> 52:46.707
I feel very close to God
when I'm out with my camera

52:46.708 --> 52:48.000
taking pictures.

52:50.875 --> 52:51.833
Yeah,

52:53.750 --> 52:54.917
it's nice.

53:03.042 --> 53:07.000
If God exists, why
doesn't He send me a sign?

53:09.208 --> 53:11.249
I don't know, you're the
one who used to be a pastor.

53:11.250 --> 53:12.457
You would know better than me.

53:12.458 --> 53:13.708
Oh come on, something.

53:14.542 --> 53:19.667
Something like, some sort of
sign that proves God exists.

53:30.333 --> 53:31.042
Hello?

53:34.125 --> 53:34.875
Yeah.

53:37.250 --> 53:38.208
Yep, that's me.

53:40.958 --> 53:41.667
Yep.

53:43.083 --> 53:44.332
Hang, hang on a second.

53:44.333 --> 53:46.041
Can I? Can I
just stop you there?

53:46.042 --> 53:47.582
Are you trying to
sell me something?

53:49.125 --> 53:53.166
No, I said, 'Are you trying
to sell me something?'

53:55.500 --> 53:58.624
Right. Well, I won't need life
insurance where I'm going.

53:59.667 --> 54:00.957
No, it's not Florida.

54:03.292 --> 54:04.292
Well, it's none
of your business!

54:04.293 --> 54:05.416
Listen, at the same time,

54:05.417 --> 54:06.250
Can you take me off

54:06.251 --> 54:08.541
whatever list it is
you've got me on, please?

54:09.833 --> 54:11.791
Well, in that case, can
I speak to the manager?

54:12.751 --> 54:14.457
No, I'd like to speak
to the manager, now!

54:15.250 --> 54:15.833
Hello?

54:17.458 --> 54:18.125
Hello?

54:21.333 --> 54:22.167
Hello?

54:26.708 --> 54:28.000
He told me to drop dead.

54:29.750 --> 54:37.041
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

54:37.042 --> 54:37.625
What?

54:37.626 --> 54:41.874
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
He told you to drop dead!

54:41.875 --> 54:45.666
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
ha! You're on the bridge!

54:45.667 --> 54:46.625
Ha, ha, ha!

54:46.626 --> 54:50.332
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha, ha, eh!

54:50.333 --> 54:51.541
Drop dead!

54:51.542 --> 54:53.957
A, Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

54:53.958 --> 54:54.999
Ha, ha!

54:55.000 --> 54:58.999
A, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

54:59.000 --> 55:01.207
Oh, oh, oh!

55:01.208 --> 55:03.166
Ohhh! Oooohhh!

55:03.167 --> 55:06.457
Ha, ha, ha, oh, ha,
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

55:06.458 --> 55:09.458
Ha, ha, ha. Ha,
ha, ha, ahhh!

55:11.417 --> 55:13.458
I didn't know you
had a cell phone.

55:14.083 --> 55:15.708
You mean a mobile phone.

55:16.708 --> 55:19.332
Doesn't everyone have one?

55:19.333 --> 55:20.125
Yeah.

55:21.458 --> 55:23.457
Did you really think
that because I'm suicidal

55:23.458 --> 55:24.458
I wouldn't have a phone?

55:26.167 --> 55:27.292
I don't know.

55:29.792 --> 55:30.583
Here.

55:31.833 --> 55:33.208
Use it to call your daughter.

55:35.167 --> 55:36.333
Go on, call her.

55:39.833 --> 55:41.708
I'm not sure I'd
know what to say.

55:43.417 --> 55:45.833
I'm sure you'll think
something. Call her.

55:48.750 --> 55:51.292
I'd have to call Joy first
'cuz I don't know her number.

55:52.208 --> 55:53.000
It's fine.

55:59.417 --> 56:02.583
Ahh, where'd you get
this thing, in a museum?

56:16.333 --> 56:17.958
Hi Joy. It's John.

56:19.251 --> 56:23.291
Hi, um, I don't have
my phone anymore,

56:23.292 --> 56:24.749
so I'm using a...

56:26.542 --> 56:27.999
It's a friend of mine's phone.

56:29.208 --> 56:31.541
Oh, it's a real long story.

56:31.542 --> 56:33.541
I'll have to tell you
when I get home.

56:33.542 --> 56:35.625
But, look Joy,

56:37.250 --> 56:40.374
I, I need to ask
you to forgive me.

56:42.167 --> 56:43.582
No, no, nothing!

56:43.583 --> 56:46.000
I just, please
hear me out. I...

56:46.583 --> 56:47.749
I just need you to forgive me

56:47.750 --> 56:49.917
for the way that I
spoke to you earlier.

56:50.417 --> 56:53.500
I've been so angry
and, and bitter.

56:55.542 --> 56:59.333
I've even been angry at God, and
I just need to forgive you.

57:00.125 --> 57:03.374
So, we can just move on.

57:03.375 --> 57:05.625
And something
happened today that just,

57:08.833 --> 57:10.958
it just made me
realize I love you.

57:12.792 --> 57:14.666
Yeah, I really do!
And...

57:14.667 --> 57:18.292
And I just want
everything to be better.

57:20.958 --> 57:24.832
Yeah, ha... You were
a knockout that day. Ha!

57:24.833 --> 57:26.541
You're still a knockout!
Ha!

57:28.833 --> 57:30.832
I just love you
very much, honey.

57:30.833 --> 57:32.792
I really really do and...

57:34.042 --> 57:37.374
Yeah, I'm so glad,
I'm so glad, it's just.

57:37.375 --> 57:39.875
Let's just put it all behind us.

57:40.458 --> 57:41.292
And ahh,

57:44.542 --> 57:47.708
And we're just gonna
make it all right, okay?

57:49.375 --> 57:50.042
Okay.

57:50.375 --> 57:51.208
Okay.

57:51.209 --> 57:54.874
Um, can you please text
Jenny's number to me?

57:56.042 --> 57:57.707
Okay, text it to this phone.

57:58.626 --> 58:01.083
Alright, alright, I,

58:02.583 --> 58:03.832
love you, honey.

58:04.875 --> 58:07.667
Okay, okay, Bye bye.

58:13.083 --> 58:14.250
How'd it go?

58:18.667 --> 58:22.624
Good.

58:22.625 --> 58:24.000
Real good!

58:25.292 --> 58:26.417
Well, that was the easy bit.

58:27.917 --> 58:29.542
Now you've gotta
call your daughter.

58:30.292 --> 58:32.333
Oh, she's gonna
text me her number.

58:41.208 --> 58:42.208
It, uh.

58:42.209 --> 58:43.291
Answer it.

58:43.292 --> 58:44.958
It's from the States.

58:53.333 --> 58:54.250
Hello?

58:55.583 --> 58:56.749
Hi Jenny.

59:00.458 --> 59:05.041
Yeah, I'm sorry but it's
very complicated, Jenny.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.041
Jenny, you shouldn't be
talking to me like that,

59:11.042 --> 59:12.249
I'm your father.

59:14.458 --> 59:16.916
Excuse me for earning a living

59:16.917 --> 59:19.541
so that you could have
everything you need.

59:22.083 --> 59:23.042
Jenny,

59:24.208 --> 59:24.875
Jenny,

59:26.500 --> 59:27.916
Now you listen to me,

59:27.917 --> 59:30.708
your mom tells me you
were out at a club last night?

59:31.208 --> 59:33.499
What's, what's up
with that, Jenny?

59:33.500 --> 59:35.416
Since when do you go to a club?

59:36.625 --> 59:38.041
Well, there's a
lot wrong with it.

59:38.042 --> 59:41.167
You weren't raised that way,
Jenny, you're better than that.

59:43.958 --> 59:45.916
Yeah, and what do
you do at a club?

59:47.958 --> 59:51.374
You were dancing, dancing
today - what tomorrow?

59:52.417 --> 59:55.666
No, Jenny I trust you,
I really, really do.

59:57.375 --> 59:59.999
Jenny, as long as you're
living under my roof

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.416
you're going to abide by...
Give me the phone,

01:00:01.417 --> 01:00:02.167
Give me the phone!

01:00:02.167 --> 01:00:02.875
Give me the...

01:00:02.876 --> 01:00:04.041
Wha, just a,

01:00:04.042 --> 01:00:05.166
What? Whoa!

01:00:05.167 --> 01:00:06.125
Whoa!

01:00:09.917 --> 01:00:11.041
Be nice.

01:00:11.042 --> 01:00:12.792
Just, be, nice.

01:00:21.125 --> 01:00:23.249
Jenny, the word of God says.

01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:24.833
Happy Birthday.

01:00:25.417 --> 01:00:27.916
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday.

01:00:27.917 --> 01:00:29.875
Good, good.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.708
I'm sorry for shouting.

01:00:34.375 --> 01:00:35.292
Sorry for shouting.

01:00:35.293 --> 01:00:37.332
I'm sorry for
shouting at you, I,

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:39.041
not just now,

01:00:39.042 --> 01:00:42.292
but I mean like I've been
shouting at you a lot lately.

01:00:43.042 --> 01:00:44.082
I miss you.

01:00:44.083 --> 01:00:45.958
I miss you.

01:00:46.458 --> 01:00:49.541
No, I really do. It's not nice
to be away all the time

01:00:49.542 --> 01:00:52.207
and I just, I really miss you.

01:00:52.208 --> 01:00:53.708
I love you.

01:00:54.792 --> 01:00:56.082
I love you.

01:00:56.083 --> 01:00:59.416
I, I mean, I know I haven't
been really good at that.

01:00:59.417 --> 01:01:04.042
Uhm, but it's, it's true, I
really, really love you, Jenny.

01:01:05.792 --> 01:01:08.083
Let's do something together.

01:01:09.417 --> 01:01:12.624
What do you say we do something
together when I get back home?

01:01:12.625 --> 01:01:16.749
Maybe one of those father
daughter dates we used to have?

01:01:18.208 --> 01:01:20.082
Yeah, yeah, that'd be great.

01:01:20.083 --> 01:01:22.625
Be like a father, mother,
daughter date thing.

01:01:23.042 --> 01:01:24.166
It'd just be great.

01:01:24.167 --> 01:01:25.167
And just...

01:01:26.667 --> 01:01:28.625
Happy Birthday.

01:01:29.083 --> 01:01:31.375
I love you and

01:01:32.458 --> 01:01:35.332
really, really, happy birthday.

01:01:40.417 --> 01:01:43.333
Okay, bye.

01:01:48.875 --> 01:01:50.042
Thank you.

01:01:56.792 --> 01:01:58.083
Just trying to help.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.582
What are those cracker
things you guys eat?

01:02:20.583 --> 01:02:24.583
They're, uh, is it
Java cookies or?

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:27.042
Dunno.

01:02:27.043 --> 01:02:29.916
You know, they're all
spongy on the inside and uh,

01:02:29.917 --> 01:02:32.207
and they got chocolate
on the outside and got a

01:02:32.208 --> 01:02:34.417
little bit of jam in, in 'em.

01:02:35.458 --> 01:02:36.957
Oh, ah, Jaffa Cakes.

01:02:36.958 --> 01:02:38.707
Jaffa Cakes, that's it!

01:02:38.708 --> 01:02:40.541
Jaffa cakes, ha ha.

01:02:40.542 --> 01:02:42.374
Jenny'll love Jaffa Cakes!

01:02:42.375 --> 01:02:45.124
I'm gonna make sure I
get her a couple of boxes

01:02:45.125 --> 01:02:46.541
and bring them home to her.

01:02:46.542 --> 01:02:48.083
And what about for Joy?

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:50.916
Oh, Joy, she's,
she's a little tougher.

01:02:50.917 --> 01:02:52.583
I'm gonna have to go to
high street for Joy.

01:02:55.125 --> 01:02:55.875
You know, Chris,

01:02:58.167 --> 01:02:59.583
I really have to thank you.

01:03:00.167 --> 01:03:00.875
What for?

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:07.208
You've opened my eyes to
a whole lot of things.

01:03:08.375 --> 01:03:09.292
You know,

01:03:09.792 --> 01:03:11.000
you're right about

01:03:11.792 --> 01:03:14.750
me not truly caring about you.

01:03:16.583 --> 01:03:18.500
I mean, I do now, but,

01:03:19.875 --> 01:03:20.833
it's like you're,

01:03:21.292 --> 01:03:25.083
you're not this non-believer
that I have to preach to.

01:03:26.083 --> 01:03:26.875
It's like,

01:03:28.375 --> 01:03:30.667
you're this really great guy.

01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:36.458
You chaps, like, really
lay it on thick, don't you.

01:03:38.875 --> 01:03:42.667
You're like this really
great guy that Jesus loves.

01:03:49.292 --> 01:03:50.750
What was Carol like?

01:03:55.667 --> 01:03:56.750
She was beautiful,

01:03:57.958 --> 01:04:00.250
gentle, sincere.

01:04:02.875 --> 01:04:05.124
She was passionate
about her views.

01:04:05.125 --> 01:04:07.124
She always had something to say.

01:04:07.125 --> 01:04:09.500
She kept me in my
place, that's for sure.

01:04:11.708 --> 01:04:12.625
She was,

01:04:13.833 --> 01:04:15.292
well, she was
extraordinary. She was...

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:17.458
...my rock!

01:04:19.167 --> 01:04:21.167
Sounds like a wonderful woman.

01:04:22.542 --> 01:04:23.667
She was.

01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:29.457
Can I do anything?

01:04:29.458 --> 01:04:30.542
No.

01:04:32.458 --> 01:04:34.083
It's time.

01:04:34.667 --> 01:04:36.125
Honey, it's too soon!

01:04:36.667 --> 01:04:38.500
Comes to everyone.

01:04:40.292 --> 01:04:42.250
Chloe should be here.

01:04:43.292 --> 01:04:44.667
It's okay,

01:04:47.208 --> 01:04:49.250
Perhaps she'll come back to us.

01:04:50.333 --> 01:04:51.625
To you.

01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:54.833
Pushed her too hard.

01:04:56.333 --> 01:04:58.292
Keep trusting.

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:02.500
He'll guide and
protect the family.

01:05:05.458 --> 01:05:07.292
I'm not sure I can anymore.

01:05:08.875 --> 01:05:11.667
Everyone has doubts.

01:05:12.583 --> 01:05:16.417
And how can I trust in a God
that allows so much pain?

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.375
I'm scared.

01:05:31.458 --> 01:05:37.000
Jesus loves me this I Know,

01:05:38.917 --> 01:05:46.708
For the Bible tells me s...

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.250
Yes, Jesus loves me,

01:05:53.083 --> 01:05:56.208
Yes, Jesus loves me,

01:05:57.792 --> 01:06:02.917
Yes... Jesus loves me,

01:06:05.292 --> 01:06:09.457
The Bible... tells me so.

01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:19.499
It's time.

01:06:23.333 --> 01:06:27.041
Look Chris, I,

01:06:27.042 --> 01:06:30.333
I don't have answers for
all your pain and everything.

01:06:31.333 --> 01:06:33.833
I don't have
answers for my own life.

01:06:35.625 --> 01:06:39.083
But we figured something out
together today haven't we?

01:06:39.958 --> 01:06:40.917
I mean,

01:06:41.292 --> 01:06:42.916
you don't believe in God.

01:06:42.917 --> 01:06:43.708
Okay.

01:06:43.709 --> 01:06:46.542
I'm not going to argue with you.

01:06:47.375 --> 01:06:50.042
But I am going to tell you that
I do believe in Him.

01:06:51.208 --> 01:06:54.999
Maybe I can't explain it right,
maybe I don't understand it all.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.667
And I believe that He's good.

01:06:57.583 --> 01:07:00.499
And He's done amazing
things in my life.

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:04.291
Maybe I messed a lot of it up
and everything but

01:07:04.292 --> 01:07:07.583
but He's just done amazing
things and,

01:07:08.792 --> 01:07:10.667
and Carol knew that.

01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:15.582
Jesus loves me this I know.

01:07:15.583 --> 01:07:17.041
She didn't know
what she was saying.

01:07:17.042 --> 01:07:19.167
She did know what
she was saying.

01:07:21.125 --> 01:07:22.832
The Lord loved her, man.

01:07:22.833 --> 01:07:24.917
He took her away from me!

01:07:27.667 --> 01:07:30.083
So tell me how does
this make all that better?

01:07:35.625 --> 01:07:40.500
What about Chloe?
Think about Chloe.

01:07:56.042 --> 01:07:57.000
You're right,

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:04.667
You're right.

01:08:08.708 --> 01:08:11.083
I should think about Chloe,

01:08:11.958 --> 01:08:13.292
and Carol.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.417
Everything you said makes,

01:08:20.917 --> 01:08:22.166
makes sense.

01:08:25.125 --> 01:08:26.667
Really?

01:08:30.792 --> 01:08:32.332
Really.

01:08:40.707 --> 01:08:41.957
Untie me.

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:47.667
You're not playing games
with me here, are ya?

01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:57.125
No, I'm tired, I need to rest.

01:09:10.292 --> 01:09:12.041
Oh, thank you!

01:09:12.042 --> 01:09:13.832
I'm busting for a pee.

01:09:13.832 --> 01:09:15.582
Woo, ha, ha, ha.

01:09:15.582 --> 01:09:19.124
You're telling me, man.
I'm ready to explode.

01:09:19.125 --> 01:09:21.042
Talk about the Lord
doing miracles!

01:09:25.332 --> 01:09:26.666
Shall I go first?

01:09:26.667 --> 01:09:27.667
Yeah, please.

01:09:30.957 --> 01:09:32.082
That way.

01:09:32.082 --> 01:09:33.082
Yeah.

01:09:58.625 --> 01:10:02.500
Um, well, thank you.

01:10:03.917 --> 01:10:04.958
I think...

01:10:11.375 --> 01:10:12.333
Bro hug!

01:10:26.708 --> 01:10:28.542
Um, I'm going that way.

01:10:31.417 --> 01:10:32.250
Yeah,

01:10:34.083 --> 01:10:35.749
You okay?

01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:37.957
Uhm, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

01:10:37.958 --> 01:10:41.958
A bit tired but uhm,
I need some rest.

01:10:46.417 --> 01:10:47.749
So, thank you.

01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:48.792
Yeah, okay.

01:10:50.708 --> 01:10:51.583
Um...

01:10:56.667 --> 01:10:59.208
is there an easier way to
get down from here?

01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:05.082
Uh yeah, uh yeah,
sorry, there's a path

01:11:05.083 --> 01:11:08.041
Take you to your camera.

01:11:08.042 --> 01:11:12.583
Oh, I see it, yeah, okay.

01:11:16.583 --> 01:11:19.083
Um, take care.

01:11:20.208 --> 01:11:21.750
Yeah, you too.

01:11:24.542 --> 01:11:25.667
Bye.

01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:22.292
Oh. Ah!

01:12:24.917 --> 01:12:26.167
Uhh, Ooohh!

01:12:26.792 --> 01:12:28.125
God help me.

01:12:30.833 --> 01:12:32.167
It might be for me.

01:12:43.042 --> 01:12:43.917
It's Chloe!

01:12:54.625 --> 01:12:56.167
Hello, Chloe?

01:12:57.583 --> 01:13:00.082
No, I'm a friend of your dad's.

01:13:00.083 --> 01:13:01.791
I'm standing with
him on a bridge

01:13:01.792 --> 01:13:04.042
and he wants to jump
and he's very serious.

01:13:06.292 --> 01:13:07.625
What do you mean again?

01:13:09.708 --> 01:13:10.999
You should never have come.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.249
I had to. The
hospital called me.

01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:16.375
You're my dad and
you tried to kill yourself.

01:13:20.125 --> 01:13:21.667
I love you, Dad.

01:13:23.792 --> 01:13:25.167
You don't understand.

01:13:29.125 --> 01:13:32.999
Well, help me and maybe we
can get through this together.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.416
It's pointless.

01:13:34.417 --> 01:13:36.582
Do you think Mum's
faith was pointless?

01:13:36.583 --> 01:13:40.083
Your mum is dead and you were
right to leave when you did.

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:44.124
I'm sorry I didn't
come to Mum's funeral.

01:13:44.125 --> 01:13:46.750
And you think that's gonna
make everything alright?

01:13:47.917 --> 01:13:49.041
Saying sorry?

01:13:49.042 --> 01:13:52.458
No Dad, I don't expect anything.

01:13:53.125 --> 01:13:55.042
I just came to make
my peace with you.

01:13:56.875 --> 01:13:58.667
You were right about me.

01:14:01.042 --> 01:14:01.958
Was I?

01:14:05.458 --> 01:14:07.625
I've become a Christian.

01:14:10.833 --> 01:14:12.667
Well, then you're
better off without me.

01:14:14.792 --> 01:14:16.499
I'm really sorry, Chloe.

01:14:18.292 --> 01:14:19.000
Goodbye.

01:14:26.583 --> 01:14:27.667
You had no right!

01:14:28.625 --> 01:14:29.999
The Lord loves you, man.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.082
Don't you preach at me!

01:14:32.083 --> 01:14:33.332
He wants you to live.

01:14:33.333 --> 01:14:35.166
But I want to die!

01:14:35.167 --> 01:14:36.249
Chloe needs you!

01:14:36.250 --> 01:14:37.291
Go home!

01:15:09.708 --> 01:15:10.583
John!

01:15:23.917 --> 01:15:24.957
John,

01:15:27.833 --> 01:15:28.708
John!

01:15:33.375 --> 01:15:38.249
Ah, oh, ah, oh.

01:15:41.333 --> 01:15:42.624
Chris.

01:15:43.958 --> 01:15:44.875
John,

01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:47.374
John!

01:15:48.126 --> 01:15:54.416
Ah, please, oh, ah.

01:16:04.292 --> 01:16:05.125
Ah.

01:16:05.667 --> 01:16:07.375
Come on, ah.

01:16:08.375 --> 01:16:09.292
Oh.

01:16:11.958 --> 01:16:15.458
Oh, ah, I can't
believe that happened.

01:16:16.708 --> 01:16:19.667
Ah, oh.

01:16:20.917 --> 01:16:29.708
Ah, I told you the bridge wasn't
high enough. Ha ha, oh, ah, ah.

01:16:30.667 --> 01:16:33.417
Oh, ah.

01:16:34.167 --> 01:16:35.292
I thought you were dead.

01:16:39.667 --> 01:16:41.125
Whatever it takes.

01:16:43.167 --> 01:16:44.083
I'm sorry.

01:16:45.458 --> 01:16:46.625
It's no problem.

01:16:47.417 --> 01:16:48.292
No really,

01:16:49.375 --> 01:16:50.500
I'm sorry!

01:16:52.958 --> 01:16:54.375
Please, forgive me.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.542
I've really messed up this time.

01:17:01.958 --> 01:17:03.917
Urh, uh,

01:17:05.542 --> 01:17:08.291
Here, put this over you.

01:17:08.292 --> 01:17:09.499
You gonna call an ambulance?

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.457
Oh yeah, of course.

01:17:11.458 --> 01:17:14.707
Uhm, here, ah, got it.

01:17:14.708 --> 01:17:16.082
Oh, it's so cold.

01:17:16.083 --> 01:17:18.542
Why is England always so cold?

01:17:19.708 --> 01:17:22.083
Uhm, when you're out of
hospital,

01:17:23.083 --> 01:17:25.875
we could get together, you
know, have a cup of tea.

01:17:26.167 --> 01:17:28.708
Oh, cup tea sounds really good.

01:17:30.292 --> 01:17:31.916
And maybe you could help
me talk to my daughter.

01:17:31.917 --> 01:17:33.083
Whatever you need,

01:17:35.792 --> 01:17:36.957
'Bro'!

01:17:36.958 --> 01:17:37.875
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:17:44.292 --> 01:17:46.332
Oh!, ah!
