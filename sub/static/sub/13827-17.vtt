SYLVIA: Once every 30 cycles,

00:34.368 --> 00:38.872
when the full moon shines,
the mighty High Gnee Council grants

00:38.956 --> 00:41.500
one lucky outsider's request for wisdom

00:41.667 --> 00:44.878
that will help them overcome even
the greatest obstacle.

00:44.962 --> 00:45.963
(WANDER GIGGLES)

00:46.046 --> 00:49.049
-What?
-You said heinie. (GIGGLES)

00:49.132 --> 00:52.970
Wander, please! Dominator's the
most serious threat we've ever faced,

00:53.053 --> 00:56.056
and she's got a really good chance
of destroying the entire galaxy

00:56.139 --> 00:58.559
and everything we love,
and everyone we love and... and...

00:58.642 --> 01:02.938
-and the High Gnees are...
-(WANDER GIGGLES)

01:03.814 --> 01:07.818
Listen, I know I'm being a wet blanket,
but we cannot afford to blow this.

01:07.943 --> 01:09.778
-The high...
-(WANDER LAUGHS)

01:09.862 --> 01:14.950
These guys are very serious,
and very uptight.

01:15.033 --> 01:18.745
They place the utmost importance
on manners and protocol,

01:18.829 --> 01:20.706
and this is not the time for jokes.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.126
WANDER: Oh, come on, Syl. Loosen up.

01:24.376 --> 01:27.754
The darkest times call
for the sunniest smiles.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.339
Not today, they don't.

01:29.423 --> 01:33.135
If we offend the High Gnees in any way,
such as laughing at their name,

01:33.343 --> 01:38.432
we lose our shot at learning the secret
that could stop Dominator. Understand?

01:39.308 --> 01:44.646
(GIGGLES) Okay. (EXHALES)
I promise to put all my power into

01:44.730 --> 01:48.734

We, Sylvia and Wander...

02:05.083 --> 02:06.376
BUTLER: Louder!

02:06.502 --> 02:08.879
have come to humbly request
an audience

02:08.962 --> 02:12.216
with the esteemed High Gnee council.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.092
(WANDER GIGGLES)

02:20.265 --> 02:22.017
SYLVIA: Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

02:25.812 --> 02:29.191
Ahem. A most gracious
thank you, sir.

02:29.274 --> 02:32.694
We desperate, needy travelers
would be most humbled

02:32.778 --> 02:37.241
if you would see fit to open your doors
to ones as lowly as we.

Bow, bow, curtsy, step left, step right,

02:40.202 --> 02:41.870

BUTLER: Well done.

02:44.456 --> 02:47.042
-I am the butler.
-(MUFFLED LAUGH)

02:47.125 --> 02:51.797
Please follow me to the hind quarters.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.173
No way.

02:53.257 --> 02:55.634
Wander, you've got to
keep it together.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.970
Okay, so his head looks like a giant...

02:58.053 --> 02:59.763
But, but, but, but, but...

02:59.847 --> 03:03.100
No buts.
The fate of the galaxy is at stake,

03:03.183 --> 03:04.893
so no more cracks.

03:08.689 --> 03:11.149
SYLVIA: Nothing. Nothing at all, sir.

03:12.818 --> 03:17.573
Okay, okay, okay.
Time to get serious. Serious. SERIOUS.

03:17.865 --> 03:21.076
BUTLER: You two, don't fall behind.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.953
(MUFFLED LAUGH)

03:23.495 --> 03:27.833
And don't forget to wipe... your feet.

03:29.751 --> 03:32.838
This shall indeed be a long night.

03:44.558 --> 03:47.102
(MUFFLED LAUGH)

03:47.352 --> 03:50.772
BUTLER: Please wait here until you are
summoned

03:50.856 --> 03:54.026
to move into the bowels of the temple.

03:54.193 --> 03:57.237
SYLVIA: Okay, Wander,
we need to get our presentation perfect

03:57.321 --> 04:01.366
if we're gonna impress these guys.
Bow, bow, curtsy, step left...

04:01.450 --> 04:02.993
Pssst! Hey!

04:03.285 --> 04:05.829
How are you keeping a straight face?

04:05.996 --> 04:07.247
GUEST: I beg your pardon?

04:07.331 --> 04:11.376
Come on. Don't tell me you don't
think that their heads look like giant...

04:11.752 --> 04:13.045
(CRASHES)

04:13.462 --> 04:17.466
BUTLER: I'm sorry,
but, is there a problem?

04:17.549 --> 04:20.594
No, sir butler of the
esteemed High Gnee council.

04:20.802 --> 04:24.473
My companion is, uh, hungry. May I?

04:24.556 --> 04:29.228
BUTLER: Please!
We Gnees like big buffets,

04:29.311 --> 04:33.398
so feel free to take a
big, juicy bite of our

04:34.483 --> 04:35.609
Rump Roast!

04:37.027 --> 04:38.403

Roasted halibut!

04:48.830 --> 04:50.791
Sparkling blopberry fizz.

04:53.544 --> 04:55.337
Bottomless, of course.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.507
And last but not least,

05:01.009 --> 05:02.427

05:07.099 --> 05:09.268
A thousand pardons,
sir butler of the High Gnee council.

05:09.351 --> 05:11.562
We must go do that thing
with the thing real quick.

(GUEST COUGHS)

05:46.388 --> 05:47.472
BUTLER: You!

05:47.931 --> 05:52.102
Is there something funny
you'd care to share with us?

05:52.186 --> 05:54.521
GUEST: Me? No, no, no, no, no, no way!

05:54.771 --> 05:58.358
Why, I'd never even dream of laughing
at such a solemn occasion,

05:58.442 --> 06:01.737
sir butler,
who looks not even a little funny.

06:01.904 --> 06:04.448
BUTLER: Guards! Out with him!

06:04.656 --> 06:05.949
Don't kick me out.

06:06.033 --> 06:09.995
I'm way more worthy than
any of these bottom feeders. Please!

06:10.162 --> 06:13.832

06:22.925 --> 06:24.760
Maybe try thinking sad thoughts.

06:24.843 --> 06:28.805

I am Gluteus,

A bee with a pollen allergy. A dog waiting
for his master to get home, only to

discover he's been sucked into
a black hole never to return.

06:41.401 --> 06:45.614
GLUTEUS: In a matter of moments, I shall
lead you into the rear of the temple,

06:45.781 --> 06:49.743
where you will make your requests.
We apologize for the delay.

06:49.826 --> 06:52.412
But the Council has been terribly
backed up.

06:52.746 --> 06:58.335
They've been stuck on their thrones
all day, and they're positively pooped.

06:58.418 --> 07:02.130
SYLVIA: Baby with a broken rattle,
baby with a broken rattle. Wander!

07:02.214 --> 07:04.716
I'm sorry, Syl.
I'm really trying hard,

07:04.800 --> 07:08.470
but these giggles have got a hold on me,
and they won't let go. (GIGGLES)

07:08.554 --> 07:14.518
Wow. I am so, so, so unbelievably
disappointed in you, Wander.

07:14.601 --> 07:18.063
We finally got a shot at stopping
Dominator, and you're about to blow it.

07:18.146 --> 07:21.525
Sylvia, do you really think
that the High Gnees (SNICKERS)

07:21.608 --> 07:23.610
are that uptight and serious?

07:23.694 --> 07:28.282
BINGLEBOP (CRYING): I don't understand.
We did everything perfectly.

07:28.365 --> 07:31.159
Heel toe, heel toe, dip, turn, turn.

07:31.243 --> 07:32.995
We're doomed.

07:35.038 --> 07:36.373
Wow, you're right.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.250
If we don't get the help
of the High Gnees,

07:38.333 --> 07:42.921
then Dominator's gonna destroy the galaxy,
and there is nothing funny about that.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.548
Really? You mean it?

07:44.923 --> 07:49.386
You're not gonna go in there and laugh
your bum off? And totally disappoint me?

07:49.845 --> 07:51.555
You're behind me all the way.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.933
I can trust you to stay serious
until the very end.

KEISTER: Do you really think a
bunch of people with heads like ours

09:59.308 --> 10:02.227
would call themselves the High Gnees?

10:02.728 --> 10:04.396
What does that even mean?

your faces are just priceless.

10:10.611 --> 10:13.572
Hold it.
You did this for what reason exactly?

10:15.365 --> 10:20.495
KEISTER: Anyone who doesn't laugh
is either lying or not paying attention.

10:20.579 --> 10:23.749
We are sick and tired of people
kissing our...

10:23.874 --> 10:27.294
