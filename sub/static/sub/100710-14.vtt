WEBVTT

00:25.286 --> 00:26.287
- Air traffic control's
reporting

00:26.330 --> 00:27.766
a helicopter in distress.

00:27.810 --> 00:28.985
- Why is it every time
I come to visit,

00:29.029 --> 00:30.073
all hell is breaking loose?

00:34.121 --> 00:35.992
- Oh no, it's gonna hit
the new Seaver Building.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.255
- It's okay.
Barry's on it.

00:38.299 --> 00:39.735
- What am I on?

01:23.561 --> 01:24.954
- Always have to make
an entrance,

01:24.997 --> 01:25.955
don't you, Kid Flash?

01:25.998 --> 01:27.565
- What can I say?

01:27.609 --> 01:29.263
It's great to be back.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.207
- A lotus flower.

02:00.250 --> 02:02.296
- Okay, that is
seriously beautiful.

02:02.339 --> 02:03.427
- Yeah, I'm definitely
gonna need you

02:03.471 --> 02:05.342
to teach me how to do that.

02:05.386 --> 02:07.344
- The lotus is one
of the eight auspicious symbols

02:07.388 --> 02:10.173
meaning purity
and renunciation,

02:10.217 --> 02:12.175
practice which I'm
currently being guided through

02:12.219 --> 02:14.395
by Bhikkhuni Amala,
the Buddhist nun

02:14.438 --> 02:15.613
assigned
to my Peace Corps camp.

02:15.657 --> 02:19.226
- Wow, purity and renunciation.

02:19.269 --> 02:21.228
Guess that means
more wine for me.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.537
Just being here celebrating
with family, new friends

02:26.581 --> 02:28.409
is all the joy I need.

02:28.452 --> 02:30.193
- Look at you
getting your Zen on.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.285
- It's working.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.201
- Who is that?

02:38.245 --> 02:40.595
- That's my brother, Wally.

02:40.638 --> 02:42.292
He looks so happy.

02:44.816 --> 02:47.384
- I wish I was there.

02:51.736 --> 02:53.085
I'm sorry.

02:53.129 --> 02:54.478
I couldn't hold the window
any longer.

02:55.697 --> 02:58.134
- It's okay.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.353
It was so good to see them,

02:59.396 --> 03:02.312
even if it was
just for a second.

03:04.053 --> 03:06.447
- You miss your family.

03:06.490 --> 03:09.319
- Yeah, well, I've been trapped
in here for weeks and...

03:11.974 --> 03:15.282
Losing my sense of time
like I'm in some sort of dream.

03:15.325 --> 03:17.458
All the while,
my family is out there

03:17.501 --> 03:20.069
with that--that thing

03:20.112 --> 03:22.463
that isn't me.

03:22.506 --> 03:24.334
- I hope they
don't forget about you

03:24.378 --> 03:26.815
as quickly as my Joseph
forgot about me.

03:33.865 --> 03:36.607
He used to come to my mirror
every day and try

03:36.651 --> 03:38.261
to figure out
a way to get me out.

03:42.657 --> 03:44.354
- Does he know
that you're still in here?

03:47.314 --> 03:48.532
- I don't know.

03:52.536 --> 03:54.016
- Barry calls me
his lightning rod.

03:55.887 --> 03:57.672
He used to say
that he could find me

03:57.715 --> 03:59.282
anywhere in the universe.

04:00.370 --> 04:02.372
- Seems like there's nothing
he wouldn't do for you.

04:06.550 --> 04:09.118
I haven't seen
my husband in years.

04:11.381 --> 04:14.036
I haven't touched him
in 72 months...

04:16.430 --> 04:19.650
312 weeks...

04:19.694 --> 04:22.131
2,190 days.

04:22.174 --> 04:24.916
2,190.
2,190.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.788
2,190.

04:26.831 --> 04:30.574
- 2,190.
2,190.

04:30.618 --> 04:33.098
- 2,190.
2,190.

04:33.142 --> 04:35.318
- Eva, listen to me.
Breathe.

04:35.362 --> 04:36.319
- 2,190.

04:38.190 --> 04:41.324
- 2,190.
2,190.

04:41.368 --> 04:43.021
- Hey, Iris, everything okay?

04:43.065 --> 04:44.545
- Um, yeah.

04:44.588 --> 04:47.374
- Greetings, Earth Prime-lings!

04:47.417 --> 04:49.767
- Babe, you're home early!

04:52.596 --> 04:55.556
Wow, you look--
- I know, right?

04:55.599 --> 04:58.341
- Wow, hey, bud.
- Hey.

04:58.385 --> 05:01.562
- You're finally back.
- I am.

05:01.605 --> 05:03.694
Well, after a while,

05:03.738 --> 05:05.435
all the post-Crisis
anomaly hunting

05:05.479 --> 05:07.219
starts to catch up
with you--

05:07.263 --> 05:10.571
that, and I wanted to wash
all the Atlantean fish smell

05:10.614 --> 05:12.486
off of these clothes.
- Mm-mm.

05:12.529 --> 05:14.009
- Hugs from here.

05:15.445 --> 05:19.275
- "Welcome home"?
You guys shouldn't have.

05:21.190 --> 05:22.452
- Shame.

05:22.496 --> 05:23.410
- Well, it's good
to see you, friend.

05:23.453 --> 05:25.368
- Wally West?

05:25.412 --> 05:28.197
What?
Where have you been?

05:28.240 --> 05:29.372
Welcome home--

05:30.765 --> 05:33.594
"Welcome home"--I see.

05:33.637 --> 05:36.379
I am crashing your party.

05:36.423 --> 05:37.598
- You know we're always happy

05:37.641 --> 05:38.816
to have you back,
Crocodile Dundee.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.035
Come on, let me make
you a drink.

05:40.078 --> 05:41.950
- Ah, you know me too well.

05:44.996 --> 05:48.086
- Okay, babe, I think we should
probably get you home.

05:48.130 --> 05:51.176
- Mm, yeah.
Yeah, you're right.

05:51.220 --> 05:53.788
It's, like, 4:00
in the morning in Atlantis,

05:53.831 --> 05:56.399
so, yeah, should probably
go to bed.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.619
- Yeah, we should get home
and relieve the babysitter.

05:58.662 --> 06:00.795
- Hon, I gotta go back
to the office.

06:00.838 --> 06:02.405
- What?

06:02.449 --> 06:03.972
- I can't get any work done
since Nash

06:04.015 --> 06:05.495
moved in across the hall.

06:05.539 --> 06:06.844
- I can give you a ride.

06:06.888 --> 06:08.106
I'm working a late shift
at the "Citizen."

06:08.150 --> 06:09.586
- Perfect.

06:09.630 --> 06:10.979
- Good night, guys.
- Good night.

06:11.022 --> 06:12.067
- Bye-bye.

06:12.110 --> 06:14.635
- Uh-uh-uh-uh, we got this.

06:14.678 --> 06:16.376
- Okay, won't argue with that.

06:18.726 --> 06:21.772
- Boy, they--you ready?
Let's do it.

06:29.911 --> 06:31.478
- Whoa, what was that?

06:31.521 --> 06:35.612
- Uh, nothing.

06:35.656 --> 06:40.661
It was, uh, just a hiccup.

06:40.704 --> 06:42.489
Just a little hiccup.

06:42.532 --> 06:45.666
- A hiccup?
Is that the first one?

06:45.709 --> 06:47.537
- Uh...

06:47.581 --> 06:48.408
- Hey, Barry.

06:49.931 --> 06:51.541
Are you all right, man?

06:51.585 --> 06:54.892
- No, I mean, I've had
a few little things.

06:56.285 --> 06:57.591
It's still sore.

06:57.634 --> 06:59.506
My speed healing was weird
for a little bit,

06:59.549 --> 07:01.508
but, I mean, it's fine now.

07:01.551 --> 07:06.077
It was just my body
still recovering from Crisis.

07:07.731 --> 07:08.819
- Barry.

07:10.734 --> 07:12.693
I didn't just come back
to see family.

07:14.521 --> 07:17.393
Lately, I've been sensing
that there's something wrong

07:17.437 --> 07:19.439
with the Speed Force.

07:21.005 --> 07:23.355
Hmm, a disturbance

07:23.399 --> 07:24.922
in the Speed Force, you feel.

07:24.966 --> 07:26.837
That's terrible Yoda.

07:26.881 --> 07:29.318
- Bhikkhuni Amala helped me
discover a way

07:29.361 --> 07:32.060
to communicate
with the Speed Force--

07:32.103 --> 07:35.672
to seek guidance by projecting
my consciousness into it

07:35.716 --> 07:37.718
while leaving my body behind.

07:37.761 --> 07:40.416
- Damn, I've never been able
to do that.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.766
It just usually comes to me.

07:42.810 --> 07:44.376
- As your mother, right?

07:44.420 --> 07:46.727
Yeah, I remember
from the lightning storm.

07:46.770 --> 07:48.903
For me, it's different.

07:48.946 --> 07:51.514
It's more of a voice
inside my head guiding me,

07:51.558 --> 07:55.953
but a few months ago,
that voice just went quiet.

07:55.997 --> 07:59.304
Now every time I try
to reach out--silence.

07:59.348 --> 08:02.482
When was the last time
the Speed Force came to you?

08:03.918 --> 08:07.617
- Uh, I mean,
it's been a while,

08:07.661 --> 08:10.185
but, listen, I don't think

08:10.228 --> 08:12.927
there's anything wrong
with the Speed Force.

08:12.970 --> 08:16.234
You know, I mean, if there was,
it would let me know, you know?

08:16.278 --> 08:18.106
Or I don't--besides,

08:18.149 --> 08:19.716
I'm sure there's
a simple explanation

08:19.760 --> 08:20.804
for all this.

08:20.848 --> 08:21.892
Trust me.

08:28.682 --> 08:31.119
- One oat milk vibe-accino,
extra hot with two sugars

08:31.162 --> 08:33.513
and three short sprinkles
of cinnamon to go.

08:35.166 --> 08:38.996
- I said three sugars
and two sprinkles of cinnamon.

08:55.404 --> 08:56.623
Alexi?

08:59.626 --> 09:01.628
- I thought you'd go down easy

09:01.671 --> 09:05.414
in that fancy helicopter
of yours.

09:05.457 --> 09:07.982
I guess now...

09:10.854 --> 09:12.595
- Frida.

09:12.639 --> 09:14.510
- Hello, Maria.

09:36.097 --> 09:37.315
- Maria!

09:49.850 --> 09:52.853
- Maria Volkova,
Russian socialite.

09:52.896 --> 09:55.333
One minute,
she's here sipping java,

09:55.377 --> 09:58.336
and the next minute,
she's a mummy?

09:58.380 --> 10:01.252
- This is the same woman
I saved from the helicopter,

10:01.296 --> 10:03.690
but she was young.
She was full of life.

10:03.733 --> 10:06.910
- Well, based on her
signal joint T-cell receptors,

10:06.954 --> 10:09.696
she was 110 years old
when she died.

10:09.739 --> 10:11.567
- Damn.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.917
So the helicopter accident--
that wasn't random.

10:13.961 --> 10:15.658
Someone targeted her.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.660
- Not just any someone.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.880
You see the kinetic energy
levels on the body?

10:19.923 --> 10:21.446
- Yeah, they're almost zero,

10:21.490 --> 10:22.839
like someone removed it all.

10:22.883 --> 10:24.885
- Therefore slowing down
the victim,

10:24.928 --> 10:27.322
which is how Maria
was aged so many years.

10:27.365 --> 10:29.541
I mean, real time, it would
have been like a second passed,

10:29.585 --> 10:31.805
but, for her,
it was almost a century.

10:31.848 --> 10:33.458
Why does this feel so familiar?

10:33.502 --> 10:34.851
Wasn't there someone
who could, like, slow--

10:34.895 --> 10:36.592
- If you're thinking
it's Turtle...

10:36.636 --> 10:38.855
- Yeah.
- It's not.

10:38.899 --> 10:40.944
This meta doesn't
just slow down time.

10:40.988 --> 10:44.295
She can create
potential energy force fields

10:44.339 --> 10:46.036
around individual victims,

10:46.080 --> 10:49.039
aging them centuries
in the blink of an eye.

10:49.083 --> 10:53.130
This wasn't Turtle.
This was Turtle 2.

10:56.177 --> 10:57.700
- Sorry, I was just waiting

10:57.744 --> 10:58.962
for you to come up
with a better name.

10:59.006 --> 11:01.182
- No, it's Turtle 2.
Less is more.

11:01.225 --> 11:02.792
- Well, what matters
is her real name,

11:02.836 --> 11:04.707
Mrs. Frida Novikov.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.753
We busted her for running
an international drug ring

11:06.796 --> 11:09.103
out of her apartment.
We deported her back to Russia.

11:09.146 --> 11:10.974
- Well, apparently,
she didn't stay put.

11:11.018 --> 11:14.369
Everywhere I went on my trip,
I heard stories about Novikov.

11:14.412 --> 11:16.327
I came home early to check out
her old haunts,

11:16.371 --> 11:18.808
and maybe find a clue
about what she's up to.

11:20.331 --> 11:22.420
I just didn't expect
she'd come back home too.

11:22.464 --> 11:24.335
- Well, we better figure out
why she's back

11:24.379 --> 11:25.902
before she ages anybody else.

11:25.946 --> 11:27.730
- Yeah, I'm gonna go
pull her file.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.210
- Okay.
- Thanks.

11:29.253 --> 11:31.125
I'll see if I can work
up a way to take

11:31.168 --> 11:33.431
the wind out
of her sails for good.

11:40.003 --> 11:42.745
The prodigal hacker returns.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.747
Regale me with the adventures

11:44.791 --> 11:48.098
of the great,
globe-trotting Cisco-lorian.

11:49.621 --> 11:51.449
I'll tell you
all about it later.

11:51.493 --> 11:54.365
Right now, I'm trying to stop
a meta who can slow down time

11:54.409 --> 11:56.803
by reworking
the Velocity-X formula

11:56.846 --> 11:58.848
to speed her up
and neutralize

11:58.892 --> 12:02.156
her kinetic energy meta-powers,
so I'm gonna focus on that.

12:03.505 --> 12:04.767
Knock-knock, Doc,
I just need your--

12:04.811 --> 12:07.857
I need to know if,

12:07.901 --> 12:10.425
on your trip...

12:10.468 --> 12:13.341
you saw anyone else
from any other Earths.

12:13.384 --> 12:15.691
- Other people?
- That's right.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.867
- From other Earths?
- That's right.

12:17.911 --> 12:21.784
- Uh, okay, not really,
because any doppelgangers

12:21.828 --> 12:22.872
who managed
to make it here--

12:22.916 --> 12:24.221
they would all be dead by now

12:24.265 --> 12:27.834
due to
neurological degeneration.

12:27.877 --> 12:29.574
- What if they
were already dead?

12:38.192 --> 12:39.976
- You gotta be kidding me.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.630
- What?

12:41.673 --> 12:45.373
- The great myth buster
suddenly believes in ghosts.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.636
No.

12:47.679 --> 12:50.987
No, I'm not talking ghosts.
I'm talking survivors.

12:51.031 --> 12:52.946
- Oh, survivors.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.817
- Yeah.
- Sure--spooky.

12:54.861 --> 12:58.995
Look, survivors, ghosts,
whatever you wanna call them,

12:59.039 --> 13:01.998
it's not possible.
Crisis made sure of that.

13:02.042 --> 13:03.826
Remember?
- I--

13:03.870 --> 13:05.741
- You wouldn't have been able
to see anything like that.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.003
- All right, fine,

13:07.047 --> 13:08.439
well, then you missed
something out there.

13:08.483 --> 13:09.658
- I missed something?

13:09.701 --> 13:10.833
- You missed something
because--

13:10.877 --> 13:11.834
- Do you know how many hours--

13:11.878 --> 13:13.705
how much time and energy

13:13.749 --> 13:15.925
I spent cataloguing
everything I saw out there?

13:15.969 --> 13:18.014
- I need your help finding
an answer that makes sense!

13:19.799 --> 13:21.713
So drop your little Velocity-F.
- X!

13:21.757 --> 13:24.455
- X--and help me track
something that really matters.

13:24.499 --> 13:27.023
- I'm trying to find a criminal
I've been after for weeks.

13:27.067 --> 13:28.851
That matters!
- To you.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.897
Well, I guess
on all your travels

13:30.940 --> 13:34.030
you finally learned to focus on
someone else besides yourself--

13:34.074 --> 13:35.118
not.

13:39.383 --> 13:41.255
- Nash, need something?

13:41.298 --> 13:43.039
- Nope.

13:47.522 --> 13:49.393
- Barry's acting
like nothing is wrong.

13:50.525 --> 13:52.919
I shouldn't get frustrated.

13:52.962 --> 13:55.486
Amala says,
"pride is the enemy of peace."

13:55.530 --> 13:56.487
- Huh.

13:56.531 --> 13:57.924
You know, I don't think

13:57.967 --> 13:59.447
Barry will ever have
the same relationship

13:59.490 --> 14:00.927
with the Speed Force
that you do.

14:02.624 --> 14:04.582
Not after what happened.

14:04.626 --> 14:05.888
- What do you mean?

14:05.932 --> 14:07.498
- Well, I don't know
the full story,

14:07.542 --> 14:10.371
but last fall,
Barry and the Speed Force

14:10.414 --> 14:13.330
had an incident.

14:14.766 --> 14:16.725
- He did not tell me that.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.076
Maybe he's trying
to work up the nerve?

14:20.120 --> 14:23.036
- Maybe, but if
that disturbance you're sensing

14:23.079 --> 14:26.953
is real, do you really
have time to waste here?

14:31.044 --> 14:32.915
- Okay, you two are seriously

14:32.959 --> 14:35.526
the best looking siblings
in the world.

14:35.570 --> 14:39.095
- The Abhidhamma teaches us
to avoid self-infatuation,

14:39.139 --> 14:41.532
but I may need you to forward
me a copy of that one.

14:41.576 --> 14:43.795
- See you later.

14:43.839 --> 14:45.623
- Mm-hmm.
- Bye.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.408
Pretty cool camera, right?

14:47.451 --> 14:49.410
I asked Cisco to pick it up
from Quimby Labs in Germany,

14:49.453 --> 14:51.194
but he definitely made
some modifications.

14:51.238 --> 14:53.022
- You need to delete
that photo right now.

14:53.066 --> 14:54.632
- Why?

14:54.676 --> 14:56.939
- We shouldn't be taking photos
of "Citizen" employees.

14:56.983 --> 14:58.985
I mean, if that got online,

14:59.028 --> 15:00.943
another of Black Hole's
assassins like Hoshi

15:00.987 --> 15:03.641
could track our moves.
- Right, sorry.

15:13.564 --> 15:15.871
- Hey, did you talk to Joe?

15:15.915 --> 15:17.438
He was gonna pull
Novikov's file.

15:17.481 --> 15:19.744
- What happened between you
and the Speed Force, Barry?

15:21.181 --> 15:25.011
Wally,
I'm working a case, all right?

15:25.054 --> 15:27.143
- If something bad happened,
that might be

15:27.187 --> 15:29.189
what's causing all these
problems with our powers.

15:29.232 --> 15:31.669
- You--listen, you don't know
what you're talking about.

15:31.713 --> 15:34.411
- I believe
that you can solve this, Barry,

15:34.455 --> 15:36.979
if you face the Speed Force.

15:37.023 --> 15:39.025
- I can't.
- Why not?

15:39.068 --> 15:42.028
- It doesn't wanna talk to me.
- How do you know that?

15:42.071 --> 15:45.335
- Because an enemy
infected my mind

15:45.379 --> 15:46.641
with nightmares and visions.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.995
- When it tried to help me,
I attacked it,

15:53.039 --> 15:55.258
so if you think the Speed Force
wants to hear from me...

15:55.302 --> 15:56.607
- Barry.

15:56.651 --> 15:58.000
- Then you--you
don't understand

15:58.044 --> 15:59.088
what the Speed Force wants.

15:59.132 --> 16:02.222
- Barry, we're already here.

16:08.924 --> 16:11.057
- We're in the Speed Force.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.710
You took me in here?

16:18.934 --> 16:20.022
- Something is wrong.

16:21.502 --> 16:24.026
We need to find her.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.854
- What the hell is that?

16:28.291 --> 16:29.510
Wally.

16:31.642 --> 16:33.209
This is my old room.

16:36.082 --> 16:37.518
What?

16:41.304 --> 16:44.525
- What's--what's going on?

16:44.568 --> 16:46.266
What's happening
to the Speed Force?

16:46.309 --> 16:48.920
- We are dying, Barry Allen.

16:50.357 --> 16:52.098
- That's not...

16:52.141 --> 16:54.143
How is that possible?

16:54.187 --> 16:56.841
- Because of what you did.

17:04.284 --> 17:06.112
- No, no, no, Wally,
we have to go back.

17:06.155 --> 17:08.070
I have to talk to her.
I have to talk to her!

17:08.114 --> 17:11.726
- Barry, what did you do?

17:17.123 --> 17:18.950
- The Speed Force--it's dying.

17:18.994 --> 17:20.474
This is why our powers
are broken.

17:20.517 --> 17:22.693
This is what we have been
sensing this whole time.

17:22.737 --> 17:26.436
- Look, it's not--
it's not possible, all right?

17:26.480 --> 17:29.091
I mean, the Speed Force is
an infinite source of energy.

17:29.135 --> 17:32.312
It's like gravity or light.
It doesn't just die.

17:32.355 --> 17:33.878
- No, it didn't
just die, Barry.

17:33.922 --> 17:36.316
She said it's dying
because of what you did.

17:37.926 --> 17:41.364
- Barry, this is your fault!

17:43.105 --> 17:45.499
- Ramsey was infecting me.
I mean, I didn't have a choice.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.892
- I'm not even talking
about what you did to her.

17:47.936 --> 17:50.112
I'm talking
about what you did after.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.332
You betrayed the Speed Force
months ago,

17:52.375 --> 17:54.290
and you didn't say
nothing then.

17:54.334 --> 17:56.118
You didn't say nothing when you
came back from Crisis either,

17:56.162 --> 17:57.467
and you started noticing

17:57.511 --> 17:58.642
something was wrong
with your powers.

17:58.686 --> 18:00.470
You could have told me, Barry.

18:00.514 --> 18:02.255
We might have gone
into the Speed Force.

18:02.298 --> 18:03.995
We might have saved it
before it was too late.

18:04.039 --> 18:05.258
- I didn't--I didn't--

18:05.301 --> 18:06.868
- But instead
you blew me off...

18:06.911 --> 18:08.304
- I--
- Again and again!

18:08.348 --> 18:11.568
- I--Wally, I didn't know
anyone else was affected.

18:11.612 --> 18:12.787
- Oh!
- All right?

18:12.830 --> 18:14.571
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

18:14.615 --> 18:19.098
- Barry, you don't get it.
We are all connected.

18:19.141 --> 18:20.882
When I used to talk
with the Speed Force,

18:20.925 --> 18:23.537
sometimes it would show me
visions of different futures,

18:23.580 --> 18:27.106
different possibilities
of how things could go.

18:29.064 --> 18:31.371
There was always
one common thread.

18:31.414 --> 18:33.329
There was always a speedster

18:33.373 --> 18:35.679
that would pick up
our mantles,

18:35.723 --> 18:38.813
like a chain of lightning
stretching through centuries.

18:40.728 --> 18:43.992
I saw my kids...

18:44.035 --> 18:45.341
running with their kids.

18:46.777 --> 18:48.214
I saw Nora.

18:50.651 --> 18:54.176
But now that chain
of lightning...

18:54.220 --> 18:55.917
it ends with us.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.702
- Okay, Wally, it's not
too late though, all right?

18:58.746 --> 19:00.617
I mean,
we still have our speed.

19:00.661 --> 19:02.489
We can go back in there.
I can save her.

19:02.532 --> 19:03.968
- No, you saw it, Barry.

19:04.012 --> 19:06.406
The Speed Force
is beyond repair.

19:06.449 --> 19:09.060
And if you think
that I'm gonna bring you

19:09.104 --> 19:11.759
back in after everything
that you have done...

19:11.802 --> 19:13.500
- Wally--

19:13.543 --> 19:15.415
- You need to find
another teacher.

19:15.458 --> 19:18.069
- Wally--we--we--

19:56.499 --> 19:58.240
- The tachyon enhancer's ready.

19:58.284 --> 19:59.807
I can't project
my consciousness

19:59.850 --> 20:01.417
into the Speed Force,
so I need you

20:01.461 --> 20:03.463
to monitor my position
while I enter it physically.

20:03.506 --> 20:06.205
- Certainly, Barry Allen.

20:06.248 --> 20:07.423
Okay, start the protocol.

20:17.172 --> 20:21.045
- Oh, my beautiful boy,
you came back.

20:21.089 --> 20:22.873
- Of course I did.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.268
You said the Speed Force
is dying.

20:27.835 --> 20:29.793
I see this lightning
everywhere.

20:29.837 --> 20:31.317
I can fix it, though.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.796
I can--you just--
you tell me what to do

20:32.840 --> 20:35.146
and I'll do it.
- It's too late.

20:35.190 --> 20:38.411
- I won't accept that.
I caused this.

20:38.454 --> 20:40.848
I have to save you.

20:40.891 --> 20:42.458
- You didn't hurt me.

20:42.502 --> 20:45.461
- I attacked you.

20:45.505 --> 20:47.158
You remember?

20:47.202 --> 20:51.250
- Barry, Barry,
that's not why I'm dying.

20:51.293 --> 20:55.341
A few months ago, a substance
entered the Speed Force--

20:55.384 --> 20:57.908
something that we'd
never encountered before.

20:57.952 --> 21:01.172
We tried to contain it,
but it contaminated us.

21:01.216 --> 21:03.131
It upset the balance
of our energies.

21:04.785 --> 21:06.874
- The green
and white lightning.

21:06.917 --> 21:11.487
- It is infernal power
beyond the laws of our nature.

21:14.142 --> 21:15.404
- No.

21:15.448 --> 21:17.493
You said you're in tune
with the multiverse.

21:17.537 --> 21:18.712
Does that include
the Speed Force?

21:19.974 --> 21:22.324
You could give me
the energy boost I need.

21:22.368 --> 21:25.501
During Crisis,
I made the Spectre give me

21:25.545 --> 21:28.025
his energy so I could enter
the Speed Force again.

21:32.247 --> 21:33.814
I am responsible.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.687
I did this.

21:39.515 --> 21:41.343
I killed the Speed Force.

21:43.432 --> 21:44.868
I didn't know.
I didn't know.

21:44.912 --> 21:46.217
I wouldn't have--
I never would have--

21:46.261 --> 21:48.481
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

21:48.524 --> 21:50.918
- Barry Allen, we forgive you.

21:50.961 --> 21:55.531
You did the right thing.
You saved our universe.

21:55.575 --> 21:58.186
You never could have foreseen
what that cost.

22:03.583 --> 22:05.324
You only have a few steps left

22:05.367 --> 22:06.977
before we're gone
from you entirely,

22:07.021 --> 22:10.459
but I know
you will use them well.

22:10.503 --> 22:13.506
The lightning chose you,

22:13.549 --> 22:15.986
and it was the best decision
that we--

22:16.030 --> 22:17.988
I ever made.

22:18.032 --> 22:21.383
You showed us
the greatest force of all.

22:27.433 --> 22:31.567
I love you.
I love you.

22:33.656 --> 22:36.398
I love you,

22:36.442 --> 22:40.968
my beautiful,
beautiful boy.

22:57.201 --> 22:58.551
- The Speed Force is dead?

22:58.594 --> 23:00.596
I don't even know what to say.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.598
Do you still have your powers?

23:02.642 --> 23:05.471
- From what I can figure out,
we still have

23:05.514 --> 23:09.039
a residual amount
of Speed Force inside us.

23:09.083 --> 23:12.565
But the more we use up,
the less we have left

23:12.608 --> 23:15.655
until--
- Until it's gone forever?

23:18.309 --> 23:19.659
- Oh, my God, son, I didn't--

23:19.702 --> 23:22.226
I can't even imagine
what you're going through.

23:22.270 --> 23:23.619
And Barry.

23:23.663 --> 23:26.405
- Dad, this is his fault.

23:26.448 --> 23:27.536
He could've come to me
months ago.

23:27.580 --> 23:29.277
We might've fixed things.

23:29.320 --> 23:31.410
But instead, he had to do
what he always does

23:31.453 --> 23:33.455
and assume he's the only one
that can handle it.

23:33.499 --> 23:35.675
- Well, Wally, did you even
need to tell him like that?

23:35.718 --> 23:37.285
I mean, we both know
that Barry

23:37.328 --> 23:39.809
will beat himself up
all by himself.

23:39.853 --> 23:41.420
- He will.

23:46.120 --> 23:50.864
I guess that wasn't very Zen
of me at all, was it?

23:50.907 --> 23:54.911
- Wally, sit down please.

23:59.612 --> 24:02.310
Do you remember what you
were like when we first met?

24:02.353 --> 24:03.703
'Cause I do.

24:03.746 --> 24:06.619
You were petulant, stubborn.

24:06.662 --> 24:08.142
Every little thing
pissed you off.

24:08.185 --> 24:10.361
You didn't want a father
or a sister or a brother,

24:10.405 --> 24:14.322
but look at the man
that you are now--

24:14.365 --> 24:17.543
the sensitive, intelligent,
compassionate man

24:17.586 --> 24:19.327
that you have become,
and it's not because

24:19.370 --> 24:22.896
of some mystical energy source
out there.

24:22.939 --> 24:26.029
It's because you did the work.

24:26.073 --> 24:30.730
Now your responsibility is
to continue to do the work

24:30.773 --> 24:32.819
to be that man.
Do you understand me, son?

24:37.345 --> 24:38.607
- Yeah?

24:38.651 --> 24:40.653
- Captain, we've got
the other informant

24:40.696 --> 24:42.350
waiting in custody.
- Thank you.

24:42.393 --> 24:46.528
Uh, this is
that Frida Novikov case.

24:46.572 --> 24:48.530
She got deported because two

24:48.574 --> 24:50.532
of our informants were part
of her smuggling ring,

24:50.576 --> 24:54.405
one of them being your friend
from the helicopter accident,

24:54.449 --> 24:55.842
Maria Volkova.

24:55.885 --> 24:57.191
- That's why Novikov
targeted Maria.

24:57.234 --> 24:59.062
She's out for revenge.

24:59.106 --> 25:01.412
- Well, the other informant
I'm gonna put in WITSEC soon.

25:02.718 --> 25:06.374
I will find you later, okay?

25:07.593 --> 25:11.074
Hey, whatever
you're going through

25:11.118 --> 25:14.338
with the Speed Force
and your powers,

25:14.382 --> 25:17.341
Barry is going
through the same thing.

25:17.385 --> 25:20.301
Remember that.
I love you.

25:20.344 --> 25:21.694
- I love you.

25:29.136 --> 25:30.616
- Not right now, Cait.

25:30.659 --> 25:32.008
I'm busy
with the mobile BARI unit.

25:32.052 --> 25:33.880
- Let me get this straight.

25:33.923 --> 25:37.231
You were trying to bioengineer
a formula to stop a meta-human,

25:37.274 --> 25:39.363
and rather than
call your friend

25:39.407 --> 25:42.976
who's a bioengineer,
you went with Bluetooth?

25:43.019 --> 25:45.587
- Yeah, I'm trying
to stop Turtle 2 here.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.589
- Yeah, I know.
It's all you've been doing.

25:47.633 --> 25:49.243
You don't have any time for me.

25:49.286 --> 25:51.201
You totally blew off Nash
when he asked for your help.

25:51.245 --> 25:53.334
I mean, you might as well
still be on your trip.

25:53.377 --> 25:54.596
- Yeah, well, maybe my trip

25:54.640 --> 25:55.815
didn't turn out
exactly as planned.

25:55.858 --> 25:57.773
- What are you talking about?

25:57.817 --> 26:02.604
You got to raid Egyptian tombs
and explore Atlantis.

26:02.648 --> 26:04.214
- I thought,
after all those adventure,

26:04.258 --> 26:06.477
I would come back different,
like Wally

26:06.521 --> 26:09.742
or like you and Frost,
but I went around the world,

26:09.785 --> 26:10.743
and I...

26:14.442 --> 26:17.619
And I feel
like I'm back where I started.

26:17.663 --> 26:19.360
- Cisco,
I know you feel responsible,

26:19.403 --> 26:22.232
but we're gonna stop Turtle 2.
I promise.

26:22.276 --> 26:24.495
We're Team Flash.
It's what we do.

26:24.539 --> 26:29.500
But in the meantime, I wonder
if maybe you don't have

26:29.544 --> 26:32.634
some other responsibilities
that you'd like to address--

26:32.678 --> 26:34.767
ones that are
a little closer to home.

26:37.900 --> 26:40.773
Yeah.
You're right.

26:40.816 --> 26:41.817
You're right.

26:44.994 --> 26:48.694
While I'm doing that,
maybe my friend the bioengineer

26:48.737 --> 26:51.610
would like to take over.
- Absolutely.

26:57.703 --> 26:58.834
- I've been looking
for you, man.

27:00.662 --> 27:02.142
- I thought maybe
you'd be home.

27:03.796 --> 27:04.753
- No.

27:07.800 --> 27:10.585
I'm not ready to tell Iris.

27:15.329 --> 27:16.809
I'm not ready to tell anyone.

27:20.073 --> 27:22.815
I found out what really
happened to the Speed Force.

27:27.515 --> 27:29.996
It died because
of what I did in Crisis.

27:30.039 --> 27:32.520
I took the Spectre's energy

27:32.563 --> 27:34.653
so I could enter
the Speed Force.

27:36.263 --> 27:39.701
His energy started a meltdown,

27:39.745 --> 27:42.661
and now it's gone, Wally...

27:44.837 --> 27:49.319
For good because of what I did.

27:49.363 --> 27:51.495
- You were trying
to save the universe.

27:53.802 --> 27:55.674
Any hero
would have made that call.

27:58.764 --> 28:00.156
I would've made that call.

28:07.207 --> 28:09.731
Amala told me a story once

28:09.775 --> 28:12.995
about a mother
who lost her only son.

28:15.519 --> 28:16.956
She was so heartbroken,

28:16.999 --> 28:18.871
she asked the Buddha
to bring him back to life.

28:21.308 --> 28:23.745
He said he would...

28:23.789 --> 28:27.270
but he had one request...

28:27.314 --> 28:30.143
a mustard seed from a family

28:30.186 --> 28:31.840
that had never lost
a loved one.

28:31.884 --> 28:35.975
So she went from neighbor
to neighbor asking for seeds,

28:36.018 --> 28:37.890
and when she would ask,

28:37.933 --> 28:39.892
"Has anyone
in your family lost someone?"

28:41.981 --> 28:44.766
The answer was always yes.

28:44.810 --> 28:46.899
The Buddha was trying
to have her understand

28:46.942 --> 28:50.729
that as much as she suffered,
she wasn't alone.

28:52.905 --> 28:56.430
When I found out
the Speed Force was dying...

28:56.473 --> 28:58.649
I forgot how much
you were suffering too.

29:01.435 --> 29:03.393
And I'm sorry.

29:03.437 --> 29:05.178
I am.

29:05.221 --> 29:09.660
- I did this.
I deserve your anger.

29:09.704 --> 29:12.228
- So do something with it.

29:12.272 --> 29:14.578
We can't punish ourselves
for the mistakes we've made.

29:14.622 --> 29:15.928
That's a closed door.

29:17.973 --> 29:21.977
But we can take responsibility
for our actions...

29:22.021 --> 29:26.025
no matter how great
the obstacle to overcome.

29:26.068 --> 29:27.853
- Amala teach you that too?

29:27.896 --> 29:28.984
- No.

29:31.073 --> 29:31.987
You did.

29:34.163 --> 29:35.991
- Guys, we've got a problem.

29:36.035 --> 29:38.689
Facial rec just picked up
Frida Novikov outside CCPD.

29:44.086 --> 29:46.001
- You really think
one criminal's

29:46.045 --> 29:47.568
worth all this backup?

29:47.611 --> 29:49.048
- If this file is right,

29:49.091 --> 29:50.701
I don't think Novikov
is gonna give up,

29:50.745 --> 29:52.573
and I'm not putting another
informant into WITSEC

29:52.616 --> 29:54.140
unless we're prepared.

30:00.015 --> 30:04.237
- Pomedlenneye, Captain.
Slow down.

30:11.897 --> 30:13.855
- Where is Olga Zhuravlev?

30:13.899 --> 30:17.293
I know she's here.
Bring her to me.

30:17.337 --> 30:19.818
- So you can turn her
into a pile of bones?

30:19.861 --> 30:24.039
- I am just taking from her
what she stole from me: time!

30:24.083 --> 30:27.608
Now, you have five minutes
to bring her to me

30:27.651 --> 30:30.089
or you all will die.
- She has Joe.

30:30.132 --> 30:32.004
- Cisco was working on a way
to stop Novikov.

30:32.047 --> 30:33.222
- So where is he?

30:36.573 --> 30:38.140
- Come in.

30:42.231 --> 30:45.365
- I wanted to apologize
for being a jerk.

30:47.323 --> 30:51.327
But I wanna make it right,
so what do you say

30:51.371 --> 30:54.461
we do some
multiversal ghost busting?

30:58.334 --> 31:02.773
Ah, Crisis, the gift
that keeps on giving, huh?

31:10.477 --> 31:12.000
You're not Nash.

31:14.002 --> 31:16.309
- Hello, Cisco.

31:21.575 --> 31:23.142
- Thawne.
- That's right.

31:23.185 --> 31:26.580
Now, where were we?

31:29.931 --> 31:31.193
Good-bye.

31:39.375 --> 31:42.944
- You're in Nash's body.
No powers.

32:10.232 --> 32:12.408
- I don't need my powers
to kill you.

32:26.988 --> 32:27.989
- Nash?

32:29.556 --> 32:31.210
But he's so full of hatred.

32:33.342 --> 32:34.561
- That's not Nash.

32:37.694 --> 32:39.958
- The new Velocity-X
is ready to use on Novikov.

32:40.001 --> 32:41.437
I just have to put it
into an injector gun.

32:41.481 --> 32:43.526
- Okay.

32:43.570 --> 32:45.050
- But we can't run it there.

32:45.093 --> 32:46.529
If we do, we'll use up speed,

32:46.573 --> 32:47.966
and we have no idea
how much we have left.

32:48.009 --> 32:49.184
- Yes, we can.

32:49.228 --> 32:51.056
We just have to use it
responsibly.

32:54.059 --> 32:56.626
Okay, the fastest route
to CCPD is in a straight line.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.977
We can run it.
We just have to phase as we go.

33:00.630 --> 33:01.675
- It's ready.

33:02.893 --> 33:05.200
- You with me?
- Always.

33:19.171 --> 33:21.608
- Time's up, Captain.

33:23.088 --> 33:26.265
- Novikov, stop.
You don't have to do this.

33:26.308 --> 33:29.442
- I know I don't have to.
I want to.

34:12.876 --> 34:15.444
Zip off again,
and I'll age him 1,000 years.

34:15.488 --> 34:17.316
- Listen to me.
Listen.

34:17.359 --> 34:19.318
We can't do anything to make up
for the time that you lost,

34:19.361 --> 34:20.884
but if you take responsibility

34:20.928 --> 34:23.322
for the time
that you have left,

34:23.365 --> 34:27.065
you won't lose anymore.
I promise.

34:27.108 --> 34:30.198
Please let us help you.

34:30.242 --> 34:33.288
- I don't want your help.

34:33.332 --> 34:35.116
- We know.

34:35.160 --> 34:36.161
Thanks for the tip, Flash.

34:45.213 --> 34:49.304
- Let's see how you handle
our version of time.

34:57.182 --> 34:59.358
- I held her in my arms.

35:02.404 --> 35:04.363
I watched her die
all over again.

35:08.932 --> 35:11.979
The Speed Force is dead
because of me,

35:12.022 --> 35:14.242
because of my choices.

35:14.286 --> 35:16.114
I just wanted to save everyone.

35:18.203 --> 35:20.335
To save you.
- And you did.

35:24.165 --> 35:26.776
Barry, none of this
is your fault.

35:26.820 --> 35:28.561
- Now I won't be able
to save anyone.

35:34.088 --> 35:36.569
What am I supposed to do
without my speed?

35:39.746 --> 35:41.356
- Maybe this is for the best.

35:43.228 --> 35:44.316
- What?

35:44.359 --> 35:46.187
- Everything happens
for a reason, right?

35:48.320 --> 35:50.583
Maybe you weren't supposed
to be the Flash forever.

35:52.411 --> 35:54.326
I mean, don't you think
that after everything

35:54.369 --> 35:55.631
the Speed Force
has put you through--

35:55.675 --> 35:57.198
all the pain,
all the heartache,

35:57.242 --> 35:58.330
all the death...

36:00.462 --> 36:03.204
Don't you think
you deserve a real life?

36:03.248 --> 36:06.164
Barry, all the world's problems
on your shoulders--

36:06.207 --> 36:08.340
that shouldn't have been
your burden to bear.

36:08.383 --> 36:09.689
- You're serious.

36:11.299 --> 36:12.735
- I am.

36:12.779 --> 36:16.391
This could be our chance
to have a normal life,

36:16.435 --> 36:19.046
to start a family.

36:19.089 --> 36:21.701
You deserve to be happy
just like everyone else.

36:24.921 --> 36:27.054
Don't you want that?

36:27.097 --> 36:29.230
- Barry, we need you
in the pipeline right now.

36:29.274 --> 36:30.623
There's something
you need to see.

36:42.069 --> 36:44.463
- Somehow, he's taken over
Nash's body.

36:48.728 --> 36:50.599
- Hi, Flash.
- Thawne.

36:52.862 --> 36:54.255
What do you want?

36:54.299 --> 36:56.126
- What do I always want?

36:59.304 --> 37:01.784
To kill you.

37:01.828 --> 37:03.221
And I'm done being patient.

37:07.355 --> 37:09.836
I can't wait
to slit your throat.

37:11.620 --> 37:15.581
When I do, when I get out--

37:15.624 --> 37:17.452
believe me.

37:19.759 --> 37:21.195
I will get out.

37:23.502 --> 37:24.677
I'm going to kill you...

37:27.506 --> 37:30.335
And then I'm going
to kill your family,

37:30.378 --> 37:33.686
and then I'm going
to kill your friends.

37:37.733 --> 37:40.127
I'm gonna kill
all your friends,

37:40.170 --> 37:43.391
starting
with your new pal Nash.

37:45.088 --> 37:46.829
- No.
- No?

37:46.873 --> 37:49.484
- Whatever you've done to him,
we're gonna stop you.

37:52.357 --> 37:54.924
- But isn't it true...

37:54.968 --> 37:57.753
that in a few short weeks,

37:57.797 --> 38:02.758
you're going to be powerless
to stop me, right?

38:02.802 --> 38:05.457
Because your Speed Force
is dead.

38:05.500 --> 38:08.198
I can feel it.

38:08.242 --> 38:09.722
And that's what you get, Barry,

38:09.765 --> 38:12.855
for trusting
such a puny, pathetic force.

38:12.899 --> 38:16.381
That's why I built my own.
And I'm coming.

38:19.558 --> 38:21.168
I'm coming for you.

38:23.475 --> 38:24.954
- We're done here.

38:24.998 --> 38:27.522
- Tick-tock.

38:32.005 --> 38:33.093
- Hey.

38:36.052 --> 38:38.359
What did he mean,
the Speed Force is dead?

38:48.543 --> 38:49.370
- Hey.

38:53.592 --> 38:55.420
You sure you wanna go already?

38:56.638 --> 38:58.379
- If I'm gonna get
to the next Peace Corps project

38:58.423 --> 39:00.250
in time, I gotta get going.

39:00.294 --> 39:01.513
- You know, it'd be
a whole lot faster

39:01.556 --> 39:03.602
if you just got a flight.

39:03.645 --> 39:06.300
- I know, but I need to walk.

39:07.649 --> 39:08.955
I need to have an open mind,

39:08.998 --> 39:10.696
be ready to embrace new ways

39:10.739 --> 39:12.393
of helping others
without my powers.

39:13.873 --> 39:15.396
- I'm so sorry about that, son.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.050
I obviously didn't want

39:17.093 --> 39:21.794
your trip home
to end like that.

39:21.837 --> 39:24.274
- It's okay, Dad.

39:24.318 --> 39:28.061
Even if things don't unfold
the way you expected,

39:28.104 --> 39:30.977
don't be disheartened
or give up.

39:31.020 --> 39:34.197
The one who continues
to advance will win in the end.

39:43.598 --> 39:45.557
You sound more like a parent
than I do now.

39:45.600 --> 39:46.775
- Oh, you know,
it's a Zen thing.

39:48.690 --> 39:50.083
- I love you, Dad.

39:50.126 --> 39:53.391
- I love you too--
too damn much.

39:53.434 --> 39:55.915
You be careful, okay?
- Mm-hmm, yes.

39:58.700 --> 40:02.617
Dad, keep an eye on Iris
for me, will you?

40:04.314 --> 40:07.448
There's something different
about her.

40:09.668 --> 40:11.409
Just make sure she's okay.

40:12.714 --> 40:15.456
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

40:18.111 --> 40:19.591
Bye-bye.
- Bye.

40:28.643 --> 40:30.428
- Spectre energy.

40:31.951 --> 40:35.215
Okay, yeah, well, that's just
energy we don't understand yet.

40:35.258 --> 40:37.435
That's something
we can figure out, right?

40:37.478 --> 40:39.219
- Absolutely.
We can run some tests,

40:39.262 --> 40:40.873
figure out how to track it--

40:40.916 --> 40:45.225
- Thanks guys, but I want
your help with something else.

40:45.268 --> 40:47.227
I've been thinking
about what Thawne said--

40:47.270 --> 40:48.533
- You mean how
he's gonna kill us all?

40:48.576 --> 40:49.838
Yeah, me too.

40:49.882 --> 40:53.320
- How he built
his own power source--

40:53.363 --> 40:55.670
the Negative Speed Force.

40:55.714 --> 40:57.629
If he can make one, then...

41:00.675 --> 41:01.676
So can we.

41:03.417 --> 41:06.028
I need your help to build
an artificial Speed Force.

41:07.856 --> 41:09.379
That's how I can get
my speed back.

41:20.565 --> 41:22.305
- I thought I deleted this.

41:30.879 --> 41:32.490
Iris?

41:32.533 --> 41:35.144
- Yeah, I'm not Iris.

41:36.755 --> 41:37.712
- Sorry you had
to find out this way.
