17:55.949 --> 17:57.451
THE SAFETY OF
OTHER RESIDENTS

17:57.493 --> 17:59.119
BY LETTING RANDOM PEOPLE
SHACK UP IN OUR DORMS,

17:59.161 --> 18:01.288
USING UP OUR RESOURCES.

18:01.330 --> 18:04.458
SIMONE: FIRST OF ALL, IT'S SHE.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.418
SECONDLY, WHAT IS
YOUR PROBLEM?

18:06.460 --> 18:08.504
NATE: SIMONE.
KEISHA: COME ON.

18:08.545 --> 18:11.256
IF YOU WANNA FILE A COMPLAINT,
I HAVE THE PAPERWORK.

18:11.298 --> 18:12.466
AFTER YOU.

18:19.681 --> 18:21.517
WHY DO YOU LET HER
DISRESPECT YOU LIKE THAT?

18:21.558 --> 18:23.977
SHE'S JUST TRYING
TO STIR ME UP.

18:24.019 --> 18:25.604
I KNOW WHO I AM.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.272
IF I SAT AROUND HERE
AND TRIED TO CORRECT

18:27.314 --> 18:29.650
EVERY PERSON THAT
MISGENDERED ME,

18:29.691 --> 18:31.068
I'D PROBABLY
RUN OUT OF AIR.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.778
WELL, IT'S STILL
NOT COOL.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.571
AND SHE'S ACTING
LIKE A DAMN KAREN.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.782
AND HONESTLY, IF YOU DON'T
HANDLE IT, THEN I WILL.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.367
SIMONE, ENOUGH!

18:38.408 --> 18:40.202
LET IT GO.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.745
YOU NEED TO START
LISTENING TO PEOPLE

18:41.787 --> 18:43.914
WHEN THEY TELL YOU
WHAT THEY WANT.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.332
HAD YOU LISTENED
TO THEA,

18:45.374 --> 18:46.583
YOU WOULD'VE SAVED HER
THE EMBARRASSMENT

18:46.625 --> 18:49.586
OF THIS--THIS
NONEXISTENT PARTY.

18:54.716 --> 18:56.135
MARCUS: THE WHOLE
N.I.L. SPONSOR THING

18:56.176 --> 18:58.387
STILL DOESN'T SIT
RIGHT WITH ME.

18:58.428 --> 19:00.139
I DON'T WANT MONEY
AND SPOTLIGHT RUINING

19:00.180 --> 19:02.266
THE INTEGRITY
OF OUR TEAM.

19:02.307 --> 19:04.518
WE GOT ENOUGH OF
A STAIN TO GET RID OF.

19:04.560 --> 19:07.521
I HEAR YOU.
BUT TO BE FAIR,

19:07.563 --> 19:10.607
IT'S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY
FOR THESE ATHLETES TO BE

19:10.649 --> 19:12.067
COMPENSATED FOR
THEIR HARD WORK

19:12.109 --> 19:13.735
AFTER BEING EXPLOITED
FOR DECADES.

19:13.777 --> 19:16.738
TRUE. EXCEPT ALL PLAYERS
AREN'T CREATED EQUAL.

19:16.780 --> 19:18.031
SO, WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN SOME

19:18.073 --> 19:19.449
GET ENDORSEMENTS
AND OTHERS DON'T?

19:19.491 --> 19:21.285
YOU WON'T KNOW
UNTIL IT HAPPENS.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.495
AND IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

19:23.537 --> 19:24.913
TIMES ARE CHANGING, MARCUS,

19:24.955 --> 19:27.207
WHETHER YOU
LIKE IT OR NOT, SO,

19:27.249 --> 19:29.710
JUST KEEP AN OPEN MIND.
S'ALL I'M SAYING.

19:32.671 --> 19:36.049
SPEAKING OF CHANGING TIMES
AND OPEN MINDS,

19:36.091 --> 19:38.010
I RECEIVED AN OFFER FOR

19:38.051 --> 19:39.386
A FULL-TIME
JOURNALIST POSITION

19:39.428 --> 19:41.972
AT THE "ATLANTA
DAILY NEWS."

19:42.014 --> 19:44.308
CONGRATS. WOW.

19:44.349 --> 19:45.475
SO, HOW ARE YOU GONNA
JUGGLE YOUR WORKLOAD

19:45.517 --> 19:47.102
WITH YOUR CLASSES?

19:47.144 --> 19:48.562
I WOULDN'T.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.272
IT MEANS
LEAVING BRINGSTON,

19:50.314 --> 19:52.357
BUT CONSIDERING THE WAY
EVERYTHING'S GOING,

19:52.399 --> 19:54.902
NOT SURE THERE'S
MUCH LEFT FOR ME
HERE ANYWAY.

19:54.943 --> 19:56.153
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.946
WHAT?

19:57.988 --> 19:59.448
I KNOW THIS IS HARD,
BUT AMARA--

19:59.489 --> 20:01.867
THEY POSTPONED
MY TENURE HEARING.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.243
SINCE WHEN?

20:03.285 --> 20:05.078
FOUND OUT EARLIER
THIS WEEK.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.331
I HAVEN'T TOLD ANYONE,
BUT WE BOTH KNOW

20:07.372 --> 20:08.749
THIS IS MORE FALLOUT
FROM ME

20:08.790 --> 20:10.334
BEING A WHISTLEBLOWER.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.085
MARCUS, IF THEY'RE
WILLING TO

20:12.127 --> 20:14.213
GO AS FAR AS MESSING
WITH MY TENURE,

20:14.254 --> 20:15.631
WHY AM I STAYING?

20:15.672 --> 20:18.258
LOOK, AMARA,
DON'T DO IT, OK?

20:18.300 --> 20:20.093
THERE'S SO MUCH LEFT
FOR YOU HERE.

20:21.386 --> 20:22.638
AT BRINGSTON.

20:24.097 --> 20:25.515
SIMONE: HEY.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.726
AMARA: HEY.
MARCUS: HEY, SIMONE.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.102
HEY.

20:29.144 --> 20:30.479
WE'LL TALK LATER.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.485
SIMONE: THAT SEEMED
PRETTY TENSE.

20:36.526 --> 20:38.654
DID YOU AND COACH MARCUS
USED TO DATE?

20:38.695 --> 20:40.113
BECAUSE Y'ALL
ARE GIVING VIBES.

20:40.155 --> 20:42.115
SIMONE HICKS.
NOW, I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU

20:42.157 --> 20:43.533
SINCE YOU WERE
A TODDLER--

20:43.575 --> 20:45.535
STAY OUT OF
GROWN FOLKS' BUSINESS.

20:45.577 --> 20:47.537
SORRY. BEEN GETTING

20:47.579 --> 20:49.039
A LOT OF THAT LATELY.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.832
ARE YOU OK?

20:50.874 --> 20:53.669
OK. NICE DEFLECT, AUNTIE.

20:53.710 --> 20:55.796
BUT YOU CAN EITHER TELL ME
ABOUT COACH MARCUS NOW

20:55.837 --> 20:57.172
OR I COULD JUST
BUG YOU TO DEATH

20:57.214 --> 20:58.382
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE
AT FAMILY DINNER.

20:58.423 --> 21:02.678
FINE. YES,
THE RUMORS ARE TRUE.

21:02.719 --> 21:04.471
MAN, Y'ALL ARE NOSY!

21:04.513 --> 21:06.431
SO, WHY'D Y'ALL BREAK UP?

21:06.473 --> 21:09.351
WE HAD A DIFFERENCE
OF OPINION.

21:09.393 --> 21:12.729
SOMETHING DEEPLY PERSONAL
TO BOTH OF US.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.398
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

21:18.735 --> 21:22.197
J.R.: AND I APPRECIATE
WHAT DAMON DID...

21:23.490 --> 21:24.825

MIGHT BE THERE TONIGHT?

21:24.866 --> 21:26.702

YOU GOT A SEC?

21:46.179 --> 21:47.806
ALL EARS.
WHAT'S GOING ON, SON?

21:51.810 --> 21:54.730
IT'S ABOUT THE, UM...AHEM.

21:54.771 --> 21:56.398
SPONSOR PRESENTATION TONIGHT.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.611
IT ISN'T FOR
YOUR WHOLE TEAM.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.363
IT'S JUST GONNA BE
FOCUSED ON ME.

22:03.405 --> 22:05.699
MARCUS: WAIT, WHAT?
DAMON: PRESIDENT ALLEN, HE--

22:05.741 --> 22:07.117
HE CONFIRMED IT
EARLIER TODAY.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.577
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I

22:08.618 --> 22:10.120
DIDN'T WANT
YOUR MOM INVOLVED.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.080
DAMN IT, DAMON!

22:12.122 --> 22:14.374
I WISH YOU'D LISTENED
TO ME FROM THE GATE.

22:14.416 --> 22:15.792
IF YOU THOUGHT THOSE
BROTHERS WAS GONNA BE

22:15.834 --> 22:17.336
DISCOURAGED BEFORE, THIS

22:17.377 --> 22:18.962
IS GONNA SHATTER
TEAM MORALE, SON.

22:19.004 --> 22:21.423
COACH, I'M SORRY.
I GENUINELY WANTED

22:21.465 --> 22:23.759
TO PUT THE GUYS ON
AND FOR ALL OF US TO WIN.

22:25.761 --> 22:28.221
INSTEAD, MY MOM,
SHE LIED TO MY FACE.

22:36.021 --> 22:38.607
I DON'T WANT THE GUYS
TO BE BLINDSIDED

22:38.648 --> 22:40.984
WHEN THEY WALK
OUT THERE TONIGHT.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.444
I KNOW IT'LL
DESTROY THEM BUT--

22:47.699 --> 22:48.909
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

22:48.950 --> 22:50.952
BE HONEST, SON.

22:50.994 --> 22:52.454
TALK TO YOUR TEAM, SON.

23:03.882 --> 23:05.133
[DAMON SIGHS]

23:07.344 --> 23:10.347
UH, GOOD EVENING.
THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING.

23:15.560 --> 23:19.981
ACTUALLY...ONE SECOND.
COME ON UP HERE, FELLAS.

23:29.741 --> 23:32.619
ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS
THAT I CHOSE BRINGSTON

23:32.661 --> 23:35.122
WAS ITS RICH HISTORY,
ITS RESILIENCE,

23:35.163 --> 23:36.415
ITS CULTURE.

23:36.456 --> 23:37.791
SOMETHING NOTHING OR NO ONE

23:37.833 --> 23:40.001
CAN EVER TAKE AWAY FROM IT.

23:40.043 --> 23:41.461
NOW, WHILE OTHER ATHLETES

23:41.503 --> 23:44.339
MIGHT BE CHASING A BAG...
[LAUGHTER]

23:44.381 --> 23:47.259
MY TEAMMATES AND I,
WE'RE CHASING OUR LEGACY.

23:47.300 --> 23:51.179
WHILE THE LEGACY OF
BRINGSTON BASEBALL...

23:51.221 --> 23:52.389
MAY BE TARNISHED...

23:53.223 --> 23:56.268
BUT I CAN GUARANTEE YOU GUYS
THAT WE'RE HERE
TO BRING IT BACK.

23:57.811 --> 24:00.021
NOW, YOU ALL KNOW ME--

24:00.063 --> 24:03.400
DAMON SIMS, STAR PITCHER,
MLB HOPEFUL.

24:05.402 --> 24:06.945
BUT TONIGHT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ME.

24:09.156 --> 24:11.616
IT'S ABOUT MY TEAMMATES.

24:11.658 --> 24:13.702
THE MEN WHO ARE
BRINGING THAT LEGACY BACK

24:13.743 --> 24:15.745
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

24:15.787 --> 24:17.205
AND I WANT Y'ALL
TO GET TO KNOW 'EM.

24:20.041 --> 24:21.960
SANTIAGO: SANTIAGO REYES.

24:22.002 --> 24:23.545
I LOVE BEING AN ATHLETE,

24:23.587 --> 24:24.838
BUT NOT JUST BECAUSE IT'S DOPE

24:24.880 --> 24:27.257
TO COMPETE AT AN ELITE LEVEL.

24:27.299 --> 24:31.052
I'M THE OLDEST OF 6 KIDS,
ALL BOYS,

24:31.094 --> 24:34.306
WHO PRETTY MUCH COPY
EVERYTHING I DO.

24:34.347 --> 24:35.640
SO, IT'S ABOUT BEING
A ROLE MODEL,

24:35.682 --> 24:37.851
BOTH ON AND OFF THE FIELD,

24:37.893 --> 24:41.271
FOR THEM AND EVERY OTHER
COLOMBIAN DREAMER

24:41.313 --> 24:44.357
THAT I AM PROUD TO CARRY
ON MY SHOULDERS.

24:46.109 --> 24:47.652
I'M POSSIBILITY.

24:47.694 --> 24:50.238
MAN: COLE HIGGINS.
I'M REDEMPTION.

I LOST MY POPS

24:55.160 --> 24:58.038

MY GPA PLUMMETED.

24:58.079 --> 24:59.998
NO COLLEGE WOULD ADMIT ME.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.542
EXCEPT BRINGSTON.

25:03.919 --> 25:05.629
BASEBALL KEPT ME ALIVE
AND BRINGSTON

25:05.670 --> 25:07.172
GAVE ME A FRESH START.

25:07.214 --> 25:08.882
I'M THE POSTER CHILD FOR LEGACY.

25:08.924 --> 25:10.842
THIS TEAM IS A PART OF
MY DIRECT LINEAGE,

25:10.884 --> 25:12.594
BUILT ON THE SHOULDERS OF
PLAYERS WHO ULTIMATELY

25:12.636 --> 25:15.096
FORGED THEIR OWN PATH
THROUGH THE NEGRO LEAGUES,

25:15.138 --> 25:16.640
DOWN TO MY GRANDFATHER
AND FATHER,

25:16.681 --> 25:19.476
WHO BOTH PLAYED BASEBALL
HERE AT BRINGSTON.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.520
I PLAY TO HONOR
ALL THOSE GREAT MEN.

25:21.561 --> 25:23.021
I PLAY TO REMIND
THE NEXT GENERATION

25:23.063 --> 25:24.564
THAT WE BELONG IN THIS SPORT.

25:24.606 --> 25:26.149

25:26.191 --> 25:28.944
SO MY FUTURE SON,
AND YOUR SON, AND ANY SON,

25:28.985 --> 25:31.154
CAN ONE DAY

39:34.372 --> 39:35.956
HUH?

39:35.998 --> 39:37.166
I'M JUST SAYING.
YOU'RE LOOKING LIKE YOU'RE

39:37.208 --> 39:38.250
TRYING TO FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT,

39:38.292 --> 39:39.585
OR SOMEONE.

39:42.129 --> 39:44.006
LOOK, I GOTTA
TELL SOMEBODY,

39:44.048 --> 39:46.008
'CAUSE I CAN'T
TAKE IT ANYMORE.

39:46.050 --> 39:48.552
BUT THIS HAS TO
STAY BETWEEN US.

39:48.594 --> 39:49.678
OK.

39:54.475 --> 39:55.601
AHEM.

39:58.354 --> 40:00.356
LOOK, I KNOW THIS MIGHT
SOUND CRAZY, BUT...

40:01.816 --> 40:03.526
I THINK DAMON
MIGHT BE MY BROTHER.

40:04.819 --> 40:06.779
SIMONE: WAIT, WHAT?
J.R.: YEAH.

40:06.821 --> 40:08.239
LIKE HOW?

40:08.280 --> 40:09.782
LOOK, WHEN I WAS
A TODDLER, I SWEAR

40:09.824 --> 40:11.534
MY PARENTS HAD
ANOTHER BABY,

40:11.575 --> 40:13.744
AND THEN ONE DAY,
THE BABY WAS JUST GONE,

40:13.786 --> 40:16.038
AND EVERYBODY ACTED
LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.124
AND I WOULD'VE THOUGHT
I JUST MADE IT UP,

40:18.165 --> 40:19.834
EXCEPT A COUPLE
YEARS AGO,

40:19.875 --> 40:21.252
I FOUND A PICTURE
OF THAT BABY

40:21.293 --> 40:23.421
IN A BIBLE THAT
MY MOM GAVE ME,

40:23.462 --> 40:25.965
AND THAT BABY LOOKED
A LOT LIKE DAMON,

40:26.006 --> 40:27.174
RIGHT DOWN TO THE SCAR.

40:29.218 --> 40:30.761
OH, MY GOD.

40:30.803 --> 40:32.346
AND HIS BIRTH PARENTS
WENT TO BRINGSTON.

40:32.388 --> 40:33.347
SO DID MINE.

40:33.389 --> 40:34.348
OK, BUT,

40:34.390 --> 40:35.599
SO DID OTHER PEOPLE.

40:36.851 --> 40:38.561
I KNOW, BUT...

40:38.602 --> 40:39.937
I MEAN,
SO DID MY AUNT

40:39.979 --> 40:41.105
AND COACH MARCUS.

40:42.440 --> 40:43.858
AND THEY WERE
A SERIOUS COUPLE

40:43.899 --> 40:46.110
UNTIL SOMETHING
SUPER PERSONAL

40:46.152 --> 40:47.278
BROKE THEM UP.

40:48.446 --> 40:51.323
WAIT. YOU DON'T
THINK THAT--

40:51.365 --> 40:52.616
THAT WHAT?

40:52.658 --> 40:53.659
COACH MARCUS
AND YOUR AUNT

40:53.701 --> 40:55.703
ARE HIS BIRTH PARENTS?

40:55.744 --> 40:57.037
SIMONE, THAT'S CRAZY.

40:57.079 --> 40:58.247
WHAT, CRAZIER THAN
YOU THINKING HE'S

40:58.289 --> 40:59.957
A BABY PHANTOM
FROM YOUR PAST?

41:01.125 --> 41:03.210
LOOK, I KNOW THIS
WHOLE THING IS WILD.

41:03.252 --> 41:04.587
BUT MAYBE WE BOTH
JUST JUMPING TO

41:04.628 --> 41:05.921
CRAZY CONCLUSIONS.

41:05.963 --> 41:07.506
OR MAYBE ONE OF US
IS ACTUALLY RIGHT.

41:09.842 --> 41:11.886
POLE DANCING IS
ABSOLUTELY A SPORT.

41:11.927 --> 41:14.472
OK, THANK YOU.
PLEASE. TELL THEM.

41:14.513 --> 41:15.681
YOU GOING HARD
FOR POLE DANCERS

41:15.723 --> 41:17.224
LIKE YOU'VE
DONE IT BEFORE.

41:17.266 --> 41:19.602
NO, I HAVEN'T, BUT...

41:19.643 --> 41:23.147
TO BE HONEST, I'VE ALWAYS,
LIKE, WANTED TO.

41:23.189 --> 41:26.025
GIRL, SAY LESS,

41:26.066 --> 41:27.485
'CAUSE IF YOU
FOR REAL, I HAVE

41:27.526 --> 41:29.195
THE PERFECT CAP
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY.

41:29.236 --> 41:31.322
