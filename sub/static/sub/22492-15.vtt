00:18.945 --> 00:20.845
It's alive!

00:40.633 --> 00:42.931
Sorry about AIDS.

00:43.002 --> 00:44.469
That was me.

00:47.740 --> 00:48.900
Ooh hoo!

00:48.975 --> 00:52.502
Mantenna and Grizzlor are
attacking the Whispering Woods!

00:52.579 --> 00:53.568
We need She-ra...

00:53.646 --> 00:56.274
Shh!
Kowl, this is not a good time.

00:56.349 --> 00:57.441
Not a good time?!

00:57.517 --> 00:59.644
But they're slaughtering the
Twiggets!

00:59.719 --> 01:01.687
The Twiggets will have to
wait!

01:01.754 --> 01:02.914
Adora has a visitor.

01:02.989 --> 01:03.853
A visitor?

01:03.923 --> 01:05.322
What kind of visitor?

01:05.391 --> 01:06.790
Her "Aunt Flow" is in town?

01:06.859 --> 01:08.793
Adora doesn't have an
Aunt Flow.

01:08.861 --> 01:10.590
Madame Razz, where is Adora?!

01:10.663 --> 01:13.530
Shadow Weaver and Leech are
attacking the Crystal Castle!

01:13.600 --> 01:14.464
Sorry, Spirit.

01:14.534 --> 01:15.592
She can't help you right now.

01:15.668 --> 01:17.067
But we need She-ra!

01:17.136 --> 01:19.730
Adora's riding the
"cotton pony," if you get my meaning.

01:19.806 --> 01:21.000
She got another horse?

01:21.074 --> 01:22.735
No, Spirit, it's not a
real...

01:22.809 --> 01:24.674
I turn into Swift Wind!

01:24.744 --> 01:26.803
Can this cotton pony do that?

01:26.879 --> 01:28.904
Madame Razz, Catra, Scorpia,
and Entrapta

01:28.982 --> 01:30.916
are attacking
Castle Bright Moon.

01:30.984 --> 01:32.349
She-ra is unavailable, Bow.

01:32.418 --> 01:33.248
Unavailable?

01:33.319 --> 01:34.149
Yes!

01:34.220 --> 01:36.313
Adora is... "floating on the
crimson tide" right now.

01:36.389 --> 01:39.051
What the hell does this have
to do with a particular type

01:39.125 --> 01:42.117
of Algal Bloom common to the
Eastern Gulf of Mexico?

01:42.195 --> 01:43.025
Never mind!

01:43.096 --> 01:45.690
Neither Adora nor She-ra can
help any of you right now.

01:45.765 --> 01:47.892
Come back in, say, five days.

01:47.967 --> 01:49.434
Maybe four, if it's a light
month.

01:49.502 --> 01:50.799
But we need She-ra!

01:50.870 --> 01:52.895
This is outrageous!

01:52.972 --> 01:53.996
Shut up! Shut up!

01:54.073 --> 01:56.667
Shu-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-t up!

01:56.743 --> 02:00.179
What does it take to get some
peace and quiet around here?!

02:02.382 --> 02:03.371
You want She-ra?

02:03.449 --> 02:04.507
Is that it, huh?!

02:04.584 --> 02:07.348
Here she comes!

02:07.420 --> 02:10.287
For the honor of Grayskull,

02:10.356 --> 02:13.883
I am She-ra!

02:16.796 --> 02:18.593
Now get out of my way!

02:20.199 --> 02:22.429
Oh, deary, me,
this isn't good.

02:24.470 --> 02:27.769
Why do I always have to be the
one...

02:27.840 --> 02:28.772
Come here!

02:28.841 --> 02:29.865
No, wait!

02:29.942 --> 02:30.966
Unh!

02:31.044 --> 02:32.841
Ya-a-a-a-h!

02:32.912 --> 02:34.004
Hyah!

02:34.080 --> 02:35.012
Ow!

02:35.081 --> 02:36.241
Ohh!

02:36.316 --> 02:37.146
Aah!

02:37.216 --> 02:38.205
Why, you...

02:38.284 --> 02:39.273
Hey! Ow!

02:39.352 --> 02:41.976
Ow!

02:42.055 --> 02:43.386
Get over here!

02:43.456 --> 02:45.788
Hey, my ey...

02:45.858 --> 02:46.790
Oh!

02:46.859 --> 02:47.883
Oh, no, you don't!

02:47.960 --> 02:48.790
Hyah!

02:48.861 --> 02:50.658
Aah! Aah!

02:50.730 --> 02:51.856
There!

02:51.931 --> 02:54.764
Now can I get some fucking
sleep?!

02:54.834 --> 02:56.597
Aah! Kill me!

02:56.669 --> 02:58.694
Please kill me!

02:58.771 --> 03:00.966
<i>Shut up!</i>

03:01.040 --> 03:02.769
Hi, thanks.
It's a sweater.

03:08.147 --> 03:10.138
Uh...

03:11.351 --> 03:12.409
What are we gonna do?

03:12.485 --> 03:14.851
We don't stand a chance of
getting laid without a car!

03:14.921 --> 03:17.253
Everybody's got a sex machine
but us.

03:17.323 --> 03:19.086
Guys, guys,
are you kidding me?

03:19.158 --> 03:21.251
We're surrounded by
possibilities.

03:21.327 --> 03:23.591
These parts could be
sex-o-matic...

03:24.997 --> 03:26.624
...vibromatic...

03:27.900 --> 03:29.595
...vulva-matic.

03:29.669 --> 03:33.662
Why, it could be hump lightning!

03:33.740 --> 03:36.265
# We'll get some lubrication and
slide it up #

03:36.342 --> 03:37.240
# And down these rods #

03:37.310 --> 03:38.242
# Circle jerkin' #

03:38.311 --> 03:39.903
# I got my wiener workin' #

03:39.979 --> 03:41.241
# Fill it with libido #

03:41.314 --> 03:43.305
# And show it to the hormone
gods #

03:43.383 --> 03:44.315
# I'm so excited #

03:44.384 --> 03:45.646
# My rocket's just ignited #

03:45.718 --> 03:47.242
# And then we'll show it all
our moves #

03:47.320 --> 03:48.582
# And we'll sic it on
some boobs #

03:48.654 --> 03:51.589
# And we'll surely be hit when
we're bringing back some tits #

03:51.657 --> 03:52.715
# Hump lightning #

03:52.792 --> 03:57.889
# Humpin', humpin', humpin' #
# Humpin', humpin', humpin' #

03:57.964 --> 03:59.795
# Humpin' #

03:59.866 --> 04:02.357
# Yeah #

04:02.435 --> 04:04.096
Can't believe it's so cool.

04:04.170 --> 04:08.368
Now go find us something to
hump.

04:08.441 --> 04:10.068
Weren't we supposed
to make a car?

04:25.491 --> 04:27.254
Yo, man!
What are you doing, man?

04:27.326 --> 04:28.657
You can't hump a jukebox.

04:28.728 --> 04:29.695
It's so crazy!

04:29.762 --> 04:30.786
People are looking.

04:30.863 --> 04:32.956
You're getting a bad rep.

04:41.007 --> 04:42.065
# I'm fine #

04:42.141 --> 04:43.165
# Me too #

04:43.242 --> 04:44.209
# We're gay #

04:44.277 --> 04:45.437
# How about you? #

04:45.511 --> 04:46.603
# I'm fine #

04:46.679 --> 04:47.737
# Me too #

04:47.814 --> 04:49.645
# Tell on us,
and we'll tell on you #

04:49.715 --> 04:50.682
Hi, Sherlock!

04:50.750 --> 04:51.648
Hiya, girls!

04:51.717 --> 04:52.945
# The story box #

04:53.019 --> 04:55.988
It seems like the story box
wants to tell us a story.

04:56.055 --> 04:58.319
Let's take a look inside.

04:58.391 --> 05:00.188
Ooh!

05:00.259 --> 05:03.160
Neato!

05:03.229 --> 05:06.130
Wow!

05:06.199 --> 05:07.166
Hey, hey!

05:07.233 --> 05:10.760
What you want to be is a
si-i-i-i-i-n!

05:10.837 --> 05:12.031
A si-i-i-i-i-n!

05:14.106 --> 05:15.869
Just shut your eyes,
Sherlock!

05:15.942 --> 05:18.069
Whatever happens,
keep them shut!

05:18.144 --> 05:19.736
Aah! Aah!

05:19.812 --> 05:21.177
Aa-a-a-a-h!

05:22.381 --> 05:26.044
Aa-a-a-a-h!

05:30.189 --> 05:31.315
Wow.

05:31.390 --> 05:33.381
I hate biblical stories.

05:34.227 --> 05:35.888
So, what are we doing?

05:35.962 --> 05:37.896
Surprise me.

05:37.964 --> 05:39.693
Hmm.

05:46.372 --> 05:47.339
Perfect.

05:48.274 --> 05:49.104
Hey, kids!

05:49.175 --> 05:51.075
Feeling run down from all the
chemo, spinal taps,

05:51.143 --> 05:53.077
and general malpractice-worthy
doctoring?

05:53.145 --> 05:55.943
Sounds like you need some
critical love... stat!

05:56.015 --> 05:58.506
Say hello to the
Intensive Care Bears.

05:58.584 --> 05:59.881
Try Skin-graft Bear!

05:59.952 --> 06:02.113
He's an inspirational patchwork
of love.

06:02.188 --> 06:04.656
He smells like morphine
sulfate!

06:04.724 --> 06:05.816
Feeling run down?

06:05.892 --> 06:08.190
Give a wheeze for Severe
Combined

06:08.261 --> 06:10.525
Immune Deficiency Syndrome Bear,
or "SCIDS" for short!

06:10.596 --> 06:12.757
We both want to walk on
grass!

06:12.832 --> 06:15.096
And let's not forget
low T-cell Bear.

06:15.167 --> 06:17.829
Being born with AIDS won't
slow him down!

06:17.904 --> 06:21.032
The Intensive Care Bears...
they're a cure for your heart!

06:21.107 --> 06:23.166
Intensive Care Bears only
cure your heart metaphorically.

06:23.242 --> 06:25.233
Some bears may cause rash,
infection, loss of vision,

06:25.311 --> 06:26.801
and/or loose stools.

06:26.879 --> 06:28.744
I never thought I'd see the
day.

06:37.356 --> 06:40.553
# Doo-wop, doo-wop #
# Doo-wop doo-wop,

06:40.626 --> 06:42.617
# Doo-wop doo-wop #
# doo-wop #

06:57.643 --> 06:58.701
I'm gonna get it!
I got it!

06:58.778 --> 07:00.871
Oh, my...
Oh, my god!

07:01.647 --> 07:05.310
Star Wars, Spongebob, Batman,
Harry Potter

07:05.384 --> 07:07.909
- the world of LEGO has all
your favorites!

07:07.987 --> 07:10.387
Now get ready for the
oscar-winning "Babel."

07:10.456 --> 07:11.821
Awesome!

07:11.891 --> 07:12.880
I am a Moroccan boy!

07:12.959 --> 07:14.119
I am going to shoot that bus!

07:14.193 --> 07:15.125
Blam blam!

07:15.194 --> 07:17.822
Tour bus playset unfolds to
reveal all your

07:17.897 --> 07:19.592
favorite characters,
like Brad Pitt!

07:19.665 --> 07:20.757
Help! My wife!

07:20.833 --> 07:21.891
I need a doctor!

07:21.968 --> 07:23.060
Turn this bus around!

07:23.135 --> 07:24.295
This country's full of Muslims,

07:24.370 --> 07:26.099
and I'm scared like a little
girl!

07:26.172 --> 07:27.161
Thrill to action and

07:27.239 --> 07:28.968
excitement at the U.S. /Mexican
border!

07:29.041 --> 07:30.099
Ay, caramba!

07:30.176 --> 07:32.508
Even comes with a
Rinko Kikuchi figure.

07:32.578 --> 07:33.567
I feel funny.

07:33.646 --> 07:35.876
"Babel" playset comes with
everything shown here.

07:35.948 --> 07:37.245
Pretentiousness sold separately.

07:37.316 --> 07:38.283
From LEGO!

07:38.951 --> 07:41.146
Aww!
Coochie-coochie-coo!

07:41.220 --> 07:42.517
Look at the baby!

07:42.588 --> 07:44.920
What a cute little baby!

07:44.991 --> 07:47.016
Aww!
Look at the little!

07:47.093 --> 07:49.755
Aww!
Who's a baby?

07:55.201 --> 07:57.066
Papa smurf!
Papa smurf!

07:57.136 --> 07:59.502
It is smurfing like
a mother smurfer!

07:59.572 --> 08:00.971
What if the dam breaks?!

08:01.040 --> 08:04.498
<i>This is exactly why I'm
Papa smurf and you're just,</i>

08:04.577 --> 08:06.238
uh... uh...

08:06.312 --> 08:07.301
Which smurf are you?

08:07.380 --> 08:09.314
I'm Army Corps of Engineers
smurf.

08:09.382 --> 08:12.476
That dam was smurfed by the
finest construction crew

08:12.551 --> 08:14.246
the forest has to offer.

08:21.427 --> 08:24.487
I didn't evacuate when them
chipmunks went rabid,

08:24.563 --> 08:25.791
and that was bad!

08:25.865 --> 08:28.425
Sure as hell ain't evacuatin'
for a little rain...

08:28.501 --> 08:30.560
Aah!

08:34.407 --> 08:37.933
Destruction, devastation,
a community in ruins.

08:38.010 --> 08:40.945
How did it come to this?

08:41.013 --> 08:42.981
Why did the dam fail?

08:43.049 --> 08:46.075
I've spent my entire adult
life searching

08:46.152 --> 08:47.210
for the smurf village!

08:47.286 --> 08:51.655
How did Anderson fucking Cooper
find it in less than a day?!

08:51.724 --> 08:52.554
Meow.

08:52.625 --> 08:54.650
And where is the King during
the greatest crisis

08:54.727 --> 08:55.921
the forest has ever known?

08:55.995 --> 08:58.930
Papa smurf says the King
doesn't care about blue people,

08:58.998 --> 09:02.991
and Papa smurf is always right
because Papa smurf...

09:03.069 --> 09:03.967
Papa smurf!

09:04.036 --> 09:05.128
What is it, Brainy?

09:05.204 --> 09:07.399
Usually the other smurfs kick
me out of the village

09:07.473 --> 09:09.873
when I start talking too much,
but...

09:10.976 --> 09:13.376
There are no smurfs left!

09:13.446 --> 09:14.606
Ha ha ha!

09:14.680 --> 09:17.706
This is the best day of my life!

09:27.426 --> 09:28.893
Ahh.

09:28.961 --> 09:30.451
Triumph at last!

09:34.433 --> 09:35.866
Ahh!

09:46.912 --> 09:47.970
Hello.

09:48.047 --> 09:50.140
It's Gargamel.

09:50.216 --> 09:52.309
Yes, the usual.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.409
With fried rice, please.

09:54.487 --> 09:56.079
For one.

09:58.224 --> 10:00.556
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk #
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk #

10:00.626 --> 10:02.685
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk-a-wawk wawk
Bawk bawk #

10:02.762 --> 10:04.821
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk #
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk #

10:04.897 --> 10:06.990
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk-a-wawk wawk

10:07.066 --> 10:09.125
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk #
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk #

10:09.201 --> 10:11.328
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk-a-wawk wawk
bawk bawk #

10:11.403 --> 10:13.394
Ba-gawk! Bawk.

10:16.475 --> 10:18.272
Ugh!
I hate when this happens.

10:18.344 --> 10:20.403
The episode we wrote was a
minute too short.

10:20.479 --> 10:23.243
Quick, guys!
Bring out the wheel of ideas!

10:29.588 --> 10:32.318
Farting retards getting kicked
in the balls it is.

10:33.893 --> 10:36.726
# La la-la la-la la-la #

10:36.796 --> 10:37.763
Ow! Hey!

10:38.831 --> 10:39.763
Ohh!

10:39.832 --> 10:41.129
I'll get you!

10:41.200 --> 10:43.464
Ow! Quit hitting me in the face!

10:43.536 --> 10:45.003
