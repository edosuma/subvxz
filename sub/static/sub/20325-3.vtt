00:15.349 --> 00:17.418
Previously on
The White Princess...

00:17.518 --> 00:20.088
Your smile
is almost convincing.

00:20.188 --> 00:22.223
My face aches from it.

00:22.323 --> 00:24.258
Our boy must claim his kingdom

00:24.358 --> 00:26.127
or the dangers
will be even greater.

00:26.227 --> 00:27.428
Did you write
to Francis Lovell?

00:27.528 --> 00:28.562
Order him to kill the King?

00:28.662 --> 00:30.398
We said that
we would come against him,

00:30.498 --> 00:31.599
what else did you
think that meant?

00:31.699 --> 00:33.534
They say
Henry is cursed by God.

00:33.634 --> 00:36.070
He brought
the sweating sickness.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.438
Has anybody sent help
out to the people?

00:37.538 --> 00:39.607
- Some of your
soldiers are changing sides.
To who?

00:39.707 --> 00:40.674
King Warwick!

00:41.809 --> 00:43.544
He's done nothing wrong!
Teddy!

00:43.644 --> 00:44.778
Lovell has fled to Burgundy.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.514
Jasper may form the envoy.

00:46.614 --> 00:49.350
He doesn't have a wife
to miss him or anyone
to pine for.

00:49.450 --> 00:51.652
You must smelt iron
in your blood,

00:51.752 --> 00:54.088
if you are to be
a queen and lead
our house to victory.

00:54.188 --> 00:55.156
Kick it down.

00:55.256 --> 00:56.424
If only we could
work together,

00:56.524 --> 00:58.792
we could be a king
for England.

00:59.260 --> 01:02.596
I have learned
a way to work my will
on Henry to help us win.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.385
-Is he coming, Lizzie?
-I'll get Lady Margaret.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.271
Burgundy has not responded.

02:17.371 --> 02:18.372
We have no indication

02:18.472 --> 02:20.241
that she'll receive them
if they go.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.109
And she's still
pirating our ships.

02:22.210 --> 02:23.277
Your Grace,

02:23.377 --> 02:26.314
the Duchess knows your uncle
as a commander of armies.

02:26.414 --> 02:29.317
Perhaps not the best choice
for a peace envoy.

02:29.417 --> 02:31.319
Strange is loyal
and will serve you.

02:31.419 --> 02:33.421
But Jasper is a man of war.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.826
- My lady,
the king's mother.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.231
Bring me good news.

02:56.777 --> 02:59.880
Maggie, I don't
want him to come out.

03:02.516 --> 03:05.886
There is a curse.
He will die, Maggie.

03:06.287 --> 03:07.288
What curse?

03:07.821 --> 03:09.557
Please, get me my mother.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.760
She made it with me.
She will know what to do.

03:14.995 --> 03:16.830
Quickly, ale to dull the pain.

03:16.930 --> 03:19.900
Please, get me my mother!

03:23.571 --> 03:25.606
To my
sister-in-law in Burgundy.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.409
We need your help
for freedom.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.944
My Lizzie is two months
in her confinement

03:31.044 --> 03:32.613
and he will not let me be
with her.

03:34.282 --> 03:36.617
His mother killed my boys
in the Tower.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.452
He slaughtered
your brother Richard

03:38.552 --> 03:39.687
on the battlefield,

03:40.988 --> 03:43.324
and now he locks
Edward Plantagenet,

03:43.424 --> 03:45.326
the York heir, in the Tower.

03:45.693 --> 03:46.760
If you are a York,

03:47.495 --> 03:50.831
rise up with us against him
and wage war.

03:57.338 --> 03:58.772
I am afraid.

04:00.408 --> 04:01.609
Push harder, Lizzie.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.378
Please, get me my mother.

04:05.313 --> 04:07.381
Open the shutters,
I need daylight.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.317
Just do what
Lady Margaret says.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.955
My son is still not born?

04:17.591 --> 04:18.892
I should have gone to her.

04:21.729 --> 04:23.797
Or is my mother right,
she is trying to kill him?

04:23.897 --> 04:27.568
Elizabeth has requested
that she attend her,

04:27.668 --> 04:29.670
but I have said that
she cannot.

04:33.341 --> 04:34.975
They say Burgundian women

04:35.075 --> 04:36.910
are all
pleasure-loving nymphs.

04:37.745 --> 04:40.348
We are not sailing there
for pleasure.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.583
But the wind peaks for Henry.

04:44.685 --> 04:45.853
The Duchess is sister

04:45.953 --> 04:48.622
to dead King Richard
and King Edward before him.

04:49.790 --> 04:53.060
You'll need to keep
your wits about you.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.929
Well, you may keep
your armor on,

04:56.029 --> 04:59.667
but I shall revel in
whatever sins they offer me.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.542
They say they need
to toss her in a blanket

05:08.642 --> 05:10.378
-to loosen the baby.
-No.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.279
You will not do that.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.881
But she isn't
pushing hard enough.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.783
Lizzie, listen to me.

05:17.885 --> 05:20.554
You must push this baby out,

05:20.654 --> 05:22.623
or you will
be made to suffer as I was.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.560
I can't.

05:26.660 --> 05:29.630
When I gave birth to Henry,
I was just a girl.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.565
I thought I would die
from the pain.

05:32.099 --> 05:35.302
But I knew it was my destiny
and my child,

05:35.403 --> 05:36.570
- if he would live...

05:36.670 --> 05:37.905
...would be King
of England

05:38.005 --> 05:39.773
because God wished it.

05:40.774 --> 05:41.875
My boy will die.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.811
Do not say that.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.480
The child will live.
Do you hear me?

05:47.848 --> 05:49.717
You will give us the heir
that Henry needs

05:49.817 --> 05:51.419
to save him from his enemies.

05:51.519 --> 05:52.620
Do you understand?

06:18.812 --> 06:19.980
My God!

06:21.014 --> 06:22.983
Yes, yes, he's here.
He's here, Lizzie,

06:23.083 --> 06:24.084
I can see him.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.902
Oh, he's here.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.578
Oh praise God, praise God.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.018
Give him to me.

07:09.863 --> 07:10.831
Ah!

07:15.869 --> 07:16.837
Henry!

07:18.639 --> 07:19.907
He is here, Henry.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.510
Prince Arthur.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.881
Henry!
No, you cannot go to her!

07:27.981 --> 07:29.550
She is in confinement!

07:31.519 --> 07:32.986
I can't believe he's real.

07:34.254 --> 07:35.656
He is so tiny.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.191
- But he is strong though.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.693
You see?

07:46.166 --> 07:48.001
Lizzie, what
did you mean about a curse?

07:48.101 --> 07:49.169
Nothing.

07:50.538 --> 07:51.605
Let's not think of it.

07:58.812 --> 07:59.880
Henry.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.552
Come in and see him.

08:07.821 --> 08:08.922
He is a boy.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.561
There's no mistake?

08:15.295 --> 08:16.564
No.

08:24.905 --> 08:25.939
He is perfect.

08:30.243 --> 08:31.912
And you are radiant.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.583
May I take him?

08:52.265 --> 08:53.601
I'm a father.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.005
Thank you.

08:58.606 --> 09:00.140
For your efforts
I am in your debt.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.677
Will you send
my mother to see me now?

09:05.879 --> 09:06.947
Yeah.

09:08.816 --> 09:09.817
Here.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.119
Feed him until he is strong.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.027
Why aren't the bells ringing?

09:21.294 --> 09:22.763
They should be ringing
out the news.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.197
And light the bonfires!

09:27.701 --> 09:29.269
And Teddy, Lizzie?

09:30.170 --> 09:31.805
Will you ask him to free
Teddy from the Tower?

09:31.905 --> 09:33.240
--Of course I will.

09:34.374 --> 09:36.076
I have delivered on my bargain

09:36.176 --> 09:38.111
now he must give
something in return.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.115
His happiness will help us.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.046
Duchess. From England.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.653
Now I have two.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.621
What does it say,
Grand-mÃ¨re?

10:23.957 --> 10:25.225
Alors, my Rettie.

10:27.828 --> 10:28.796
This one...

10:29.229 --> 10:31.231
is from the
Dowager Queen of England,

10:31.331 --> 10:32.733
called Elizabeth.

10:33.801 --> 10:36.737
And she says I must make war.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.772
And this one...

10:39.072 --> 10:40.841
is from the new king,
Henry Tudor,

10:41.374 --> 10:42.743
who bids me peace.

10:44.978 --> 10:45.979
Go.

10:54.021 --> 10:56.656
Jasper Tudor and Lord Strange?

10:56.990 --> 10:58.258
I take it you refused them?

10:58.358 --> 10:59.793
I did not reply.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.796
But my spies tell me
they're sailing anyway.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.065
The very man
who led the Tudor army.

11:06.299 --> 11:07.768
You must stand with Elizabeth

11:07.868 --> 11:08.869
and fight them.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.772
You cannot sit back
any longer, Duchess.

11:13.406 --> 11:14.742
Cannot, Francis?

11:17.144 --> 11:19.079
So you would tell me
what to do now,

11:20.447 --> 11:22.215
just as England seeks to?

11:23.851 --> 11:25.418
Just because you failed
to kill the King

11:25.518 --> 11:27.821
while you were standing
right beside him.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.091
My choice...

11:32.292 --> 11:34.962
is to remain a thorn
in Henry Tudor's side.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.832
As I've been doing
for so many happy months.

11:39.466 --> 11:42.235
Which is why I grant you
safety at my court.

11:44.905 --> 11:47.174
If they come,
I will refuse to see them

11:47.274 --> 11:48.441
and then they will go.

11:50.811 --> 11:51.779
Ah!

12:02.790 --> 12:05.292
My step-mother has not
mourned her brother
King Richard...

12:05.392 --> 12:07.094
She will not even speak of it.

12:07.828 --> 12:10.697
She thinks that she can hide
here, and the world
will stay outside.

12:10.798 --> 12:11.999
Well, she is wrong.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.103
The time has come
to be a York,

12:17.470 --> 12:18.939
and take a stand.

12:26.947 --> 12:27.915
Did they hurt you?

12:30.150 --> 12:32.820
-I tried to come to you.
-Mother.

12:35.455 --> 12:36.523
Look.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.301
A boy.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.907
God's ways are strange indeed

12:55.142 --> 12:57.177
but He answers
Lady Margaret's prayer.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.312
He answers mine.

13:01.414 --> 13:03.216
He is my own dear boy.

13:10.858 --> 13:11.925
He is perfect.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.929
Did you hear how loudly
she screamed?

13:16.429 --> 13:18.065
I thought she would
split open.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.403
Cecily, would you fetch me
some wine, my throat is dry.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.873
And Lizzie sounds
rather hoarse as well.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.516
Guard your heart, my Lizzie.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.119
The child is not your own.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.424
He belongs to the Throne.

13:46.994 --> 13:49.930
And never forget what the red
in that rose stands for.

13:52.399 --> 13:53.967
Your family's blood.

13:55.635 --> 13:56.803
Your lover's blood.

13:56.904 --> 13:59.106
Richard is gone now, Mother.

14:04.144 --> 14:06.546
All that there
is now is Arthur.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.049
Arthur.

14:16.123 --> 14:17.324
Well...

14:18.491 --> 14:20.560
A new royal name at last.

14:47.487 --> 14:48.956
Perhaps now we have the boy

14:48.989 --> 14:51.058
who will bring back peace
to England.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.526
Half York, half Tudor.

14:54.962 --> 14:56.196
He is only Tudor.

14:57.697 --> 14:59.399
And he is not just a boy.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.971
He is my son's heir and heir
to the throne of England.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.373
Of that there is no doubt.

15:07.007 --> 15:09.309
Oh, there is always doubt,

15:09.409 --> 15:10.643
Lady Margaret.

15:12.212 --> 15:13.546
For I once had two boys

15:13.646 --> 15:15.983
who were destined
there themselves.

15:17.017 --> 15:18.986
Nothing is ever certain.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.455
Or can you read the future?

15:38.705 --> 15:41.441
Here comes the
English fools

15:41.541 --> 15:43.310
Hoping to make peace.

15:44.011 --> 15:48.148
They look
so tired and miserable.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.617
Wouldn't you be, Mary?

15:51.018 --> 15:52.685
coming from a Tudor court?

15:54.054 --> 15:56.323
And still no
satisfaction when
they get here.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.458
Perhaps we will make
use of them

15:58.558 --> 16:01.261
for sport though, no?

16:21.348 --> 16:22.515
Don't be fooled by her.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.253
She's formidable
and quite the politician.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.689
She is a Maximilian
in charge.

16:33.426 --> 16:36.063
It's his wife Mary
who has the lineage's
daughter

16:36.129 --> 16:38.065
to the late
Charles the Bold,

16:38.131 --> 16:40.400
but as you would expect
when there's a York around

16:40.600 --> 16:42.402
it's the step-mother
who really holds the power.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.072
Most say she ruled the Duchy

16:45.172 --> 16:47.274
long before her husband
passed away.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.413
I wonder what he died of.

17:02.655 --> 17:05.158
The christening
must take place at once.

17:05.525 --> 17:08.095
Whatever doubts
the people have
will be forgotten

17:08.161 --> 17:09.496
when they see
God smiles on you.

17:09.596 --> 17:11.264
They cannot wait till
Lizzie's been churched?

17:11.364 --> 17:12.399
It is not the custom.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.667
And she has no function
at the service.

17:14.767 --> 17:17.104
What is important

17:17.204 --> 17:19.706
is that England knows
you have an heir.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.143
And your enemies will find
much stonier ground

17:23.243 --> 17:25.112
in which to seed dissent.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.683
I will consult with Lizzie.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.119
You...

17:32.652 --> 17:34.287
You are taking counsel...

17:35.222 --> 17:36.223
From your wife?

17:36.589 --> 17:38.725
From somebody
who knows the will of England.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.161
She is mother
to the child.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.130
Unless I am mistaken.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.146
It is good of you
to take the time

17:59.246 --> 18:00.780
to see us, Your Graces.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.150
Well, you have come
all this way.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.354
Would you take some wine?

18:07.454 --> 18:09.422
We have so much to drink.

18:14.561 --> 18:17.164
You have lost something,
My Lord?

18:20.567 --> 18:22.169
The Duchess doesn't join us?

18:22.202 --> 18:23.870
She doesn't wish to
lay eyes on the man

18:24.237 --> 18:27.807
who beat her brother to an
early death on Bosworth Field.

18:27.907 --> 18:29.242
With respect, Duchess,

18:29.342 --> 18:31.344
without a death the battle
wouldn't end.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.879
We are sorry for her loss.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.648
And to you too,
Duchess Cecily.

18:36.516 --> 18:37.717
We commend his soul to God.

18:37.817 --> 18:41.354
How good of you to say so
after all this time.

18:41.454 --> 18:44.191
- Let's move to business.
- No.

18:45.892 --> 18:48.261
We will respect the Duchess
and her grief.

18:49.696 --> 18:52.199
Our business may come later,
when she's ready.

18:52.499 --> 18:54.767
If you will grant us leave
to stay until that time...

18:57.737 --> 18:58.705
Maximilian?

19:11.551 --> 19:12.552
Wait here?

19:13.253 --> 19:14.321
I can think of worse things.

19:14.421 --> 19:17.357
Do you like to play,
Lord Strange?

19:18.225 --> 19:19.692
Play? Mmm.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.295
What kind of games?

19:24.531 --> 19:26.399
My children love
sword fighting

19:26.499 --> 19:28.435
and they can never
find opponents.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.370
Ah, well.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.308
If they don't mind losing...

19:40.847 --> 19:42.715
Ah!

19:44.551 --> 19:46.486
I wasn't, uh, I wasn't ready.

19:46.586 --> 19:47.720
Philip.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.457
Boys are so impetuous.

20:08.275 --> 20:09.576
Why must it be Winchester?

20:10.277 --> 20:11.411
For the christening?

20:12.412 --> 20:14.247
I cannot be so many days
away from him.

20:14.347 --> 20:16.215
I have said your mother
may come with us.

20:16.816 --> 20:17.950
She is godmother.

20:20.086 --> 20:21.187
This time she is
really going, Lizzie.

20:21.288 --> 20:22.622
And I am not.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.995
I have commissioned
his own badge for him.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.536
The red rose
and the white combined.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.338
A sign of our new unity.

20:43.410 --> 20:44.477
I'd hoped for your approval.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.381
Our mothers will not give it.

20:49.882 --> 20:51.551
I think they like the war
between them.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.420
But you do not?

20:55.622 --> 20:57.624
Now that I have given
you a son,

20:58.391 --> 20:59.759
will you release Teddy?

21:02.562 --> 21:03.763
I cannot while I am away
from London.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.432
Then when you return?

21:07.500 --> 21:09.336
Please, Henry, he's terrified.

21:09.836 --> 21:12.339
-I will consider it.
-He is a child.

21:13.973 --> 21:16.843
-You would not wish it
on Arthur.
-I said I will consider it.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.346
And take a view.

21:37.964 --> 21:40.367
Bring the child.
We are leaving.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.503
If you were to
christen him in London,

21:43.603 --> 21:45.638
I would not have
to be apart from him.

21:46.973 --> 21:50.009
The priest will come on your
40th day to sanctify you

21:50.477 --> 21:51.978
so you can return to court.

21:52.412 --> 21:53.980
Please take care of him.

22:43.830 --> 22:44.864
Duchess.

22:45.565 --> 22:46.566
Leave us.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.644
Your court is very beautiful.

22:58.044 --> 23:00.447
I thought when I returned
to England

23:01.080 --> 23:03.850
I'd be happy to leave
Europe well behind me.

23:05.952 --> 23:07.353
I miss the light.

23:07.454 --> 23:09.456
But the light is not
why you are here.

23:10.189 --> 23:11.658
Enough playacting.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.494
Please relay your message
from your king.

23:15.061 --> 23:16.463
King Henry sent a gift.

23:17.597 --> 23:19.466
As a token of his friendship.

23:23.870 --> 23:24.804
A sovereign.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.105
A coin of solid gold

23:26.205 --> 23:28.074
and the King himself
is rendered on the front.

23:28.708 --> 23:31.143
Perhaps he fears his reign
will be so short,

23:31.243 --> 23:32.812
he must have permanence?

23:33.746 --> 23:37.049
The King feels
most confident in his reign

23:37.149 --> 23:39.686
and would have peace
with Burgundy.

23:41.153 --> 23:43.389
He wishes to return
your trading rights.

23:43.490 --> 23:45.958
And forge new alliances
between our nations.

23:46.726 --> 23:47.694
Oh.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.731
So, now it hurts him to lose
his gold and ships,

23:52.164 --> 23:54.967
he finds it in his heart
to be our ally?

23:59.839 --> 24:01.541
When Henry was in exile,

24:02.642 --> 24:05.111
you tried to hand him
to your brother for execution.

24:07.714 --> 24:08.848
You cannot be surprised

24:08.948 --> 24:11.984
that when he won the throne
he sought to punish you.

24:12.084 --> 24:13.720
No, not surprised.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.989
He spent his life
in brothels and in cow-sheds.

24:17.089 --> 24:18.691
What would he know
of politics?

24:21.193 --> 24:22.595
Or pain.

24:24.764 --> 24:25.965
Who has he lost?

24:28.134 --> 24:29.201
I have lost

24:30.002 --> 24:31.237
three brothers,

24:31.904 --> 24:34.140
and a father and a husband.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.776
This war has cost him nothing.

24:45.618 --> 24:46.919
I cannot bear it.

24:47.954 --> 24:49.756
Being parted from him.

24:50.623 --> 24:52.158
The King said that
he would free him,

24:52.825 --> 24:53.960
when Arthur
has been christened?

24:54.060 --> 24:56.563
And I will do everything
I can to see that he does.

24:56.596 --> 24:57.597
And when I am blessed,

24:57.697 --> 24:58.965
we will go to the
Tower immediately

24:59.065 --> 25:00.132
and visit Teddy.

25:00.700 --> 25:01.934
Thank you.

25:04.937 --> 25:06.038
What did you mean?

25:07.640 --> 25:08.808
About a curse?

25:10.843 --> 25:12.478
I know you meant it.
I'm worried, Lizzie.

25:12.579 --> 25:14.246
It is nothing
that would hurt Teddy.

25:16.215 --> 25:18.751
It was on whoever killed
my brother in the Tower.

25:21.120 --> 25:25.124
We laid a curse that their
male line would die.

25:27.126 --> 25:28.895
So, if it was
at Lady Margaret's orders

25:28.995 --> 25:30.663
that my brother's life
was taken...

25:30.763 --> 25:31.798
Lizzie.

25:33.332 --> 25:35.602
But no harm
will come to Arthur.

25:36.903 --> 25:38.104
No harm will come.

25:38.738 --> 25:40.940
You said yourself
he is strong.

25:42.008 --> 25:43.042
He's strong.

27:23.242 --> 27:24.911
Dowager Elizabeth.

27:26.412 --> 27:27.714
Please,

27:28.715 --> 27:29.816
come with me.

27:41.493 --> 27:44.731
- Teddy! Teddy!
- Come here. It's all right.

27:50.970 --> 27:52.104
It's all right.

27:56.075 --> 27:58.210
I am sorry we have
not come to see you, Teddy.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.881
I had a baby boy
and Maggie helped me.

28:03.115 --> 28:04.784
I had little baby Arthur.

28:04.884 --> 28:06.385
Can we go now, Maggie?

28:08.755 --> 28:09.889
I'm so sorry you're here.

28:09.989 --> 28:11.758
We are trying
to bring you home.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.965
Cousin Lizzie
will be queen soon.

28:20.099 --> 28:22.935
And she has told the King
that you shouldn't be here.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.370
Because it's a mistake.

28:27.473 --> 28:29.008
And when you are free,
we shall go

28:29.108 --> 28:31.210
and live together
somewhere quiet.

28:32.111 --> 28:33.479
In a little house

28:34.446 --> 28:37.784
far away from kings
and castles.

28:38.317 --> 28:40.319
Well, you'll be
home soon, Teddy.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.321
I promise.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.792
I love you, sweetheart,
I love you.

28:47.426 --> 28:50.496
Take me home.
Please, take me home, Maggie.

29:07.880 --> 29:10.016
We know for certain
it was Elizabeth.

29:11.350 --> 29:14.720
She wrote to Lovell
in a plot to steal your throne

29:14.821 --> 29:16.989
and put the boy
Edward Plantagenet upon it.

29:18.457 --> 29:20.192
Now that your son
is safely in the world,

29:20.292 --> 29:22.028
you must imprison her.

29:22.461 --> 29:24.897
She will have spread her web
to Burgundy already.

29:26.432 --> 29:28.400
No doubt
she's exhorting war.

29:29.902 --> 29:32.004
Surely she has nothing
she can offer them,

29:32.104 --> 29:33.873
while I now have a son
to bargain with.

29:34.473 --> 29:37.343
Jasper will impress this
on the Duchess.

29:38.510 --> 29:42.048
He will win her to obedience
with the benefits of trade.

29:42.949 --> 29:44.150
Just have faith in him.

29:44.250 --> 29:47.419
I will have faith in God
and God alone.

29:48.888 --> 29:50.890
Mortal men must earn it.

30:03.069 --> 30:04.236
Give him to me!

30:04.336 --> 30:05.404
Give him to me.

30:06.939 --> 30:08.207
I have been practicing.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.342
I am to be a married woman.

30:11.110 --> 30:12.144
John Welles.

30:12.244 --> 30:13.345
He's Lady Margaret's
half-brother,

30:13.445 --> 30:14.981
so he's very close
to the throne.

30:15.281 --> 30:16.348
He's rich and very handsome.

30:16.448 --> 30:18.517
He smiled at me
through the whole christening.

30:18.617 --> 30:20.352
Lady Margaret says
I'm to have him.

30:20.452 --> 30:21.787
Does he have a say in it?

30:21.888 --> 30:23.122
Where is our mother?

30:23.890 --> 30:25.391
Perhaps you should ask
your husband.

30:37.469 --> 30:38.871
- Henry.

30:42.141 --> 30:43.442
He cried throughout.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.478
-I suppose that's
what they do.
-It is.

30:47.313 --> 30:48.380
Where is my mother?

30:51.583 --> 30:53.152
She is locked up in a dungeon.

30:55.187 --> 30:58.057
My mother proved
she was behind
the Lovell plot to kill me.

31:02.694 --> 31:05.497
She wanted Teddy on the throne

31:05.597 --> 31:07.934
and for that reason,
I cannot set him free.

31:08.034 --> 31:10.236
My enemies
require a figurehead.

31:10.336 --> 31:12.939
He would be snatched
and made to be that symbol.

31:13.639 --> 31:15.074
You said that
you would release him.

31:15.174 --> 31:16.608
You promised me you would.

31:16.708 --> 31:20.079
I said I would
consider it and take a view.

31:20.179 --> 31:21.613
You must listen
far more carefully

31:21.713 --> 31:23.615
to what people say
if you wish to be a queen.

31:24.383 --> 31:26.318
You will not leave her
in a dungeon. I forbid it.

31:29.621 --> 31:30.622
If she is to be
kept away from me

31:30.722 --> 31:32.358
then house her
in an abbey.

31:33.159 --> 31:35.027
Put her in retirement
if you must.

31:37.629 --> 31:40.967
Let it be Bermondsey Abbey,
at least there is a garden.

31:42.501 --> 31:44.070
Prepare for your coronation.

31:45.004 --> 31:46.105
I have ordered it.

31:57.749 --> 32:01.353
No, That's... That's...
This line here, that's out.

32:02.054 --> 32:03.389
-That's out.
-No, it wasn't.

32:06.558 --> 32:08.027
This is out.

32:08.127 --> 32:09.561
You lost the point.

32:15.367 --> 32:18.504
You should have told me
that your friend is such
a marvelous court jester.

32:20.006 --> 32:21.507
Oh, he is no friend of mine.

32:23.342 --> 32:25.144
But then,
I think you know that.

32:31.683 --> 32:33.452
I'm sorry for my clumsiness.

32:34.420 --> 32:36.188
I did not mean
to cause you pain.

32:38.490 --> 32:39.491
Will you walk?

32:43.495 --> 32:45.331
I thought you would
be celebrating.

32:46.132 --> 32:48.367
My spies tell me
Henry has a son.

32:50.569 --> 32:53.539
So, you know, then,
that Henry's position
is much stronger.

32:54.540 --> 32:55.674
There will be alliances,

32:56.475 --> 32:58.177
a betrothal for the Prince.

33:01.047 --> 33:02.148
And, uh...

33:02.648 --> 33:05.251
Should we choose
a French princess

33:05.351 --> 33:07.053
and make our peace with them?

33:07.153 --> 33:09.121
And France is the enemy
on our doorstep,

33:09.221 --> 33:12.091
and so you would wage war
on us with them.

33:12.824 --> 33:15.461
But if we are
already fighting you,

33:16.228 --> 33:17.396
what difference does it make?

33:17.829 --> 33:19.231
You are decided then?

33:20.599 --> 33:22.334
I have no love of war.

33:23.202 --> 33:25.071
But I cannot like your king.

33:26.272 --> 33:27.539
You do not know him.

33:29.641 --> 33:30.976
And you have too strong a mind

33:31.077 --> 33:34.080
to let the past
or old scores sway you.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.417
Henry won at Bosworth fairly.

33:38.750 --> 33:41.420
In fact,
he was the outside chance.

33:42.188 --> 33:44.323
I think that he has you
to thank for that.

33:44.756 --> 33:46.525
I was by his side
throughout the battle

33:46.625 --> 33:48.294
and since he was a child.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.598
I am heart and soul for Henry.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.102
I would give my life for him.

33:58.237 --> 34:01.107
What does he do
to inspire such loyalty?

34:01.807 --> 34:03.809
When he has a goal
he does not waiver.

34:05.111 --> 34:07.579
He was brave in exile,
he is strong.

34:09.315 --> 34:11.650
He has greater loyalty
than any man I've ever known.

34:12.751 --> 34:15.521
Then he would make
someone a very fine dog.

34:19.591 --> 34:20.592
Duchess.

34:22.494 --> 34:24.663
I know that you have
Europe on your side

34:24.763 --> 34:26.698
and that you do not
need England.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.143
I'm not a politician,

34:37.843 --> 34:39.211
or a lawyer.

34:39.778 --> 34:41.413
I don't have clever words.

34:42.814 --> 34:44.416
I am a man of war,

34:45.784 --> 34:48.520
and while I have not lost
my kin to it,

34:51.157 --> 34:52.524
I've lost my life.

34:54.193 --> 34:56.728
-The good years
when I should have...
-What?

35:06.172 --> 35:08.174
I cannot bring
your brothers back.

35:09.508 --> 35:12.178
But if we strike out
for peace,

35:12.844 --> 35:16.448
then we can see that
no one else you love
is stolen from you.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.256
This is to be our home?

35:58.457 --> 36:00.692
King Henry shows mercy on you.

36:05.831 --> 36:09.668
You will pray for four hours
a day and see no visitors.

36:10.536 --> 36:13.439
What about my daughter,
Princess Elizabeth?

36:13.772 --> 36:15.241
She is no longer
your daughter,

36:15.307 --> 36:18.844
but King Henry's queen
on Sunday.

36:26.885 --> 36:31.423
Air and exercise may
be taken in the garden.

36:31.823 --> 36:33.759
For one hour,

36:34.526 --> 36:36.895
at dawn and sunset.

36:52.611 --> 36:53.879
I don't think I should like
to be queen.

36:53.979 --> 36:55.481
The clothes are all too ugly.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.584
I should be much happier
as wife to John Welles.

36:58.684 --> 37:00.519
It is a love match, anyway.

37:06.892 --> 37:08.994
Deliver this to my mother
in Bermondsey Abbey.

37:10.696 --> 37:11.797
Ned will help you.

37:12.564 --> 37:14.300
She will tell us
how to help my cousin.

37:14.766 --> 37:15.801
But Lizzie,

37:15.901 --> 37:18.304
shouldn't we find a way
to help Teddy ourselves?

37:19.037 --> 37:20.739
If we were caught,
it would be worse for him.

37:20.839 --> 37:22.408
I have tried and failed.

37:23.709 --> 37:24.976
My mother is our only hope.

37:38.324 --> 37:40.392
Come on my loves,
no more apples.

37:40.492 --> 37:42.394
They'll give you
a stomach ache.

37:45.631 --> 37:47.666
Ned. Ned, I've seen her.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.337
Come on, my loves,
let's go inside.

37:55.907 --> 37:57.409
You sent for me?

37:58.109 --> 37:59.345
Yes.

37:59.411 --> 38:01.413
I am not yet recovered
from my child-bed.

38:01.747 --> 38:03.014
I...

38:05.016 --> 38:06.485
You are thankful?

38:07.486 --> 38:08.587
For the coronation?

38:09.020 --> 38:10.556
That I shall take you
as my queen?

38:11.357 --> 38:13.525
I would be thankful
if you freed my cousin

38:13.625 --> 38:15.561
from the Tower and let
my mother be with me.

38:15.661 --> 38:16.728
I have said why I cannot.

38:16.828 --> 38:18.630
Then you cannot ask me
to be thankful.

38:21.433 --> 38:23.268
What will be my role
when I am queen?

38:23.369 --> 38:25.371
-Your role?
-And what will I do for you?

38:29.708 --> 38:30.842
It is a test.

38:30.942 --> 38:33.412
You mean to prove you know
more than I do how to rule.

38:33.512 --> 38:35.647
-It is a question.
-It is a jibe.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.917
You compare my efforts
to your father's

38:39.651 --> 38:41.553
or the old York king,
your lover.

38:45.624 --> 38:48.527
Everywhere I look around me,
nobles conspire against me.

38:49.428 --> 38:51.296
Servants slip
each other notes.

38:51.397 --> 38:54.400
They smile into my face
and then behind me
draw their knives.

38:54.466 --> 38:56.067
Well, that is what
it is to be king.

38:57.002 --> 38:59.571
My father had the same
thing, as did Richard,

38:59.671 --> 39:01.473
from you and Lancaster.

39:02.574 --> 39:04.443
And those who killed
my brothers in the Tower.

39:04.543 --> 39:07.413
Well, it is more
than I can bear each day.

39:09.415 --> 39:10.882
Waiting, wondering
if I'll live till supper.

39:10.982 --> 39:12.418
Wondering if our son
will live.

39:12.484 --> 39:13.852
Well, why did you
slaughter Richard

39:13.952 --> 39:15.654
if you do not wish
to be king?

39:15.754 --> 39:18.724
Because I had been trained
to do it all my life.

39:23.495 --> 39:24.930
There was no
other life for me.

39:25.731 --> 39:27.566
No other choice.
My life had been decided

39:27.666 --> 39:29.668
from the moment I was born.

39:33.204 --> 39:34.773
You must have heard
my mother speak of it.

39:34.873 --> 39:36.642
She felt I had a destiny

39:36.742 --> 39:38.877
from the moment
that she had me.

39:39.845 --> 39:42.981
I was to be the king for her
because she dreamed of power.

39:43.849 --> 39:45.517
Perhaps you
cannot understand

39:45.617 --> 39:48.019
being told your whole life
what you are,

39:48.820 --> 39:51.457
with never any chance to think
about it for yourself.

39:53.091 --> 39:55.060
I sometimes wonder
what I would have been.

39:56.562 --> 39:58.897
What I would have chosen
had my life been ordinary.

40:04.503 --> 40:06.472
That is what my life
has been as well.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.076
A puppet for my mother's
own ambition.

40:13.945 --> 40:15.947
It was her who craved
the throne for me.

40:19.618 --> 40:21.687
-I would have settled
for a man...
-A man you loved.

40:34.800 --> 40:38.103
I don't ask that you love me
in the way that you loved him.

40:39.505 --> 40:42.440
But I had hoped
you may have come
to have a tenderness.

40:43.509 --> 40:44.576
At least.

40:46.211 --> 40:47.546
A kindness, even.

40:48.780 --> 40:50.482
And would that be
enough for you?

40:53.184 --> 40:55.654
You don't want someone
who burns to be with you,

40:58.189 --> 40:59.691
who would ride
across the battlefield

40:59.791 --> 41:01.092
just to hear your voice?

41:01.993 --> 41:02.994
I...

41:04.796 --> 41:05.997
Do not know.

41:09.701 --> 41:11.036
I've never had it.

41:15.206 --> 41:16.742
What have they done to us?

41:19.144 --> 41:20.746
We are their creatures.

41:27.118 --> 41:29.187
At least your sister
will be happy.

41:30.822 --> 41:33.792
-John Welles is a good man.
-What can we do, Henry?

41:37.162 --> 41:38.597
What can we do?

41:40.265 --> 41:41.867
I know you cannot love me.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.770
I know it is beyond
what you can give.

41:46.304 --> 41:50.075
I only ask that you do not
plot against my life.

41:51.943 --> 41:54.646
At least spare me
that humiliation.

42:00.251 --> 42:02.053
But of course, you cannot

42:03.254 --> 42:05.190
even promise that.

42:46.297 --> 42:47.265
Bridget.

42:48.033 --> 42:49.034
Come along.

42:55.641 --> 42:57.175
- Look at your sisters.

43:03.014 --> 43:04.082
Dear Mother,

43:05.450 --> 43:08.319
please send word
that you are safe and well
in Bermondsey Abbey.

43:09.054 --> 43:11.990
Teddy is still in the tower
and Henry refuses
to release him.

43:13.124 --> 43:14.993
I need your help
and guidance.

43:15.861 --> 43:17.663
Your daughter, Lizzie.

43:33.311 --> 43:35.881
- There's very little
York about him.

43:37.382 --> 43:39.785
I think he has
my mother's eyes.

43:40.819 --> 43:42.754
I'm glad we can
be friends at last.

43:45.156 --> 43:47.225
Now that you have Arthur,

43:48.760 --> 43:50.261
you are joined with us.

43:51.797 --> 43:53.865
And any threat against Henry

43:55.033 --> 43:57.368
is a threat against
our boy as well.

43:59.771 --> 44:02.708
And I can see how much
you care for him.

44:07.145 --> 44:10.782
And tomorrow,
you will be Queen of England.

44:36.007 --> 44:39.144
Lizzie, the message came
to Ned from your mother.

44:40.178 --> 44:41.747
It was recited.

44:53.759 --> 44:55.393
She says that
you should go to her.

44:55.493 --> 44:58.129
That she will bribe a monk to
let you slip into the abbey.

44:58.764 --> 44:59.798
On my coronation day?

44:59.898 --> 45:01.666
She says you must
write to Burgundy

45:01.767 --> 45:03.201
and say they must bring war.

45:03.902 --> 45:06.037
-But, Lizzie...
-How will that help Teddy?

45:06.137 --> 45:07.438
Or your baby Arthur?

45:10.275 --> 45:11.810
Tell my daughter

45:11.910 --> 45:15.013
if a letter came from her,
the Queen of England,

45:15.113 --> 45:17.082
Henry Tudor's own wife,

45:17.182 --> 45:19.284
then she would persuade
the Duchess.

45:19.885 --> 45:21.486
Tell her to remember
who she is.

45:22.020 --> 45:24.823
Descendant of the
water goddess Melusina,

45:25.356 --> 45:27.859
and a true, white York.

45:31.162 --> 45:32.831
Tell her that I love her,

45:34.900 --> 45:36.101
and I miss her,

45:38.837 --> 45:40.271
and I need her.

45:51.116 --> 45:53.819
God save the Queen.

46:10.401 --> 46:12.170
You are the
Queen of England now.

46:13.504 --> 46:14.873
Do you feel different?

46:15.874 --> 46:18.376
I feel as though I've aged
1,000 years.

46:24.349 --> 46:26.084
I wonder if he'll feel
the same.

46:34.159 --> 46:36.427
If he does succeed me
to the throne.

46:39.197 --> 46:42.000
-My enemies may see
to it that he does not.
-Don't say it.

46:44.069 --> 46:45.370
Never say it, Henry.

47:24.275 --> 47:25.410
What have you decided?

47:25.911 --> 47:26.945
Will you see your mother?

47:27.045 --> 47:28.914
She has paid a monk
to let me in.

47:29.614 --> 47:32.083
But if you make him angry,
if he catches you...

47:32.183 --> 47:34.152
He will not let poor Teddy
out in any case.

47:34.252 --> 47:35.520
But he has to.

47:37.055 --> 47:39.024
Maybe if he learns
to trust you?

47:39.690 --> 47:41.026
Now that you are queen,
maybe he will want

47:41.126 --> 47:42.827
-to make you happy.
-How can I know what to do

47:42.928 --> 47:44.195
now I have Arthur?

47:45.330 --> 47:46.431
If my mother brings an army,

47:46.531 --> 47:48.599
how can I choose between
my mother and my son?

47:50.201 --> 47:51.937
I don't think
you should go, Lizzie.

47:52.637 --> 47:54.372
But if I don't,
when will I see my mother?

47:55.606 --> 47:57.275
Will I ever see her again?

47:59.077 --> 48:00.311
Your Grace.

48:23.568 --> 48:24.669
Oh.

48:25.036 --> 48:27.372
- Lord Strange,
oh, you look most sad.

48:28.373 --> 48:30.108
There was no game
that you could win?

48:30.208 --> 48:31.476
They are your children.
We are your guests.

48:31.576 --> 48:33.878
- Of course I let them win.
- Oh.

48:33.979 --> 48:35.480
Poor Lord Strange.

48:36.114 --> 48:37.182
Come.

48:37.282 --> 48:39.350
If it makes you feel better,
we will have one race.

48:39.450 --> 48:41.386
And you will at least
win something.

48:42.087 --> 48:44.122
I wouldn't want you
to exhaust yourself.

48:44.222 --> 48:46.191
I believe that I can
ride one race.

48:49.527 --> 48:51.229
We go to the far tree
and come back.

48:58.536 --> 49:00.671
I assume
she is an expert rider.

49:00.771 --> 49:02.507
- Never beaten.

49:04.242 --> 49:07.012
Come, let's leave them
to their blood sports.

49:07.578 --> 49:09.247
Shall we walk again?

49:13.551 --> 49:15.020
Tell me, Jasper...

49:15.486 --> 49:17.155
What would you have done
with all those years,

49:17.255 --> 49:20.058
had you not been
at war or out in exile?

49:20.458 --> 49:22.027
Who knows? Another life.

49:25.296 --> 49:26.731
You have regrets.

49:28.499 --> 49:30.235
You would have liked to marry.

49:34.039 --> 49:35.440
It didn't seem to be

49:36.274 --> 49:38.109
God's plan for me.

49:38.543 --> 49:40.645
Of course there are
whore-houses,

49:41.646 --> 49:43.381
but a true companion,

49:44.282 --> 49:47.185
someone you can trust
and grow with...

49:52.323 --> 49:53.491
There was someone I loved.

50:00.165 --> 50:01.399
But it wasn't meant to be.

50:05.470 --> 50:07.272
You surprise me,
Jasper Tudor.

50:09.607 --> 50:11.309
You are not
who I thought you'd be.

50:26.591 --> 50:28.259
Tell her that I love her,

50:31.296 --> 50:32.597
and I miss her,

50:36.201 --> 50:37.602
and I need her.

50:54.319 --> 50:55.353
There is still time.

50:58.389 --> 50:59.724
You are a handsome man.

51:02.260 --> 51:03.794
There is still life ahead.

51:06.497 --> 51:09.567
Perhaps a York and Tudor union
might grow to be a fashion.

51:22.313 --> 51:23.481
Damn them.

51:28.686 --> 51:30.421
They have my Cecily.

51:31.456 --> 51:33.824
And now they take
my Lizzie, too?

51:36.827 --> 51:38.396
Is this your work?

51:42.433 --> 51:44.569
I will not have it.

51:51.676 --> 51:52.643
Don't.

51:55.280 --> 51:56.247
No.

52:00.351 --> 52:01.852
Damn them all to hell!

52:20.505 --> 52:21.572
Mary?

52:24.209 --> 52:25.210
Mary?

52:27.645 --> 52:28.713
Can you move?

52:30.348 --> 52:31.916
Help me to carry her inside.

52:43.228 --> 52:45.296
--Come here, come here.

52:58.643 --> 52:59.944
They say...

53:01.246 --> 53:02.713
Her back is broken.

53:08.319 --> 53:09.354
Will she live?

53:15.760 --> 53:16.794
What? No.

53:31.676 --> 53:32.877
Enough.

53:33.811 --> 53:35.346
She's gone.

53:37.782 --> 53:39.284
She's gone.

55:22.086 --> 55:23.721
I am sorry for your loss.

55:27.792 --> 55:29.727
You said no one else
would die.

55:33.664 --> 55:35.032
If there's
anything I can do...

55:42.873 --> 55:44.409
Get out.

55:45.476 --> 55:46.877
You're not welcome here.

55:49.714 --> 55:50.948
I said get out!
