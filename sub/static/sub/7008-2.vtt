00:03.735 --> 00:08.140
Well, today we kick off the <i>Tool
Time lyric-writing contest.</i>

00:08.207 --> 00:10.875
For years our theme song
has had no words.

00:10.943 --> 00:12.277
Klaus?

00:15.848 --> 00:19.051
Hey? And a theme song
without lyrics is like...

00:19.118 --> 00:22.754
Well, it's like Al's mom
without a 5:00 shadow.

00:26.492 --> 00:28.693
As I was saying,

00:28.761 --> 00:31.096
Detroit's finest songwriters

00:31.164 --> 00:34.866
are vying to have their
lyrics be the crown jewel

00:34.934 --> 00:37.702
in the dazzling <i>Tool Time</i> theme!

00:37.770 --> 00:41.039
You heard it right.
There's no money involved.

00:41.107 --> 00:44.142
Heidi, tell them
how the contest works.

00:44.210 --> 00:47.712
Well, our contestant begins to sing and
the moment we don't like what we hear...

00:47.780 --> 00:49.013
Flonko!

00:51.384 --> 00:53.117
Well, let's bring out
our first contestant.

00:53.185 --> 00:57.088
He is a carpet installer,
Wade Waller.

01:04.596 --> 01:05.997
Thank you.

01:06.065 --> 01:07.398

Now it's only 16 hours,
37 minutes, and 45 seconds

04:28.201 --> 04:30.001
until you leave for Costa Rica.

04:31.304 --> 04:33.405
Forty-four seconds.

04:33.473 --> 04:36.975
Randy, maybe we shouldn't spend
our last moments together

04:37.042 --> 04:39.811
counting our last
moments together.

04:39.878 --> 04:41.679
You're right.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.459
I just can't believe you're
gonna be there for a whole year

04:49.489 --> 04:51.022
and I'm not going with you.

04:51.090 --> 04:53.891
I know. You know, when we
both applied for this thing,

04:53.959 --> 04:57.496
I always pictured the two of us
working together in the rainforest.

04:57.563 --> 05:00.365
You know, we'd spend our mornings
protecting endangered species...

05:00.433 --> 05:04.068
And our afternoons
collecting dung samples.

05:08.407 --> 05:10.108
Look, it'll only be a year.

05:10.176 --> 05:11.547
I'll be back here
before you know it.

05:11.577 --> 05:12.844
I know. I know.

05:14.980 --> 05:17.782
I'm just really gonna miss you.

05:17.850 --> 05:19.984
I'm gonna miss you, too.

05:20.052 --> 05:23.021
Randy, while I'm gone, would you
just promise me one little thing?

05:23.088 --> 05:25.089
Don't worry about it.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.625
I won't look at any other girls,

05:26.692 --> 05:28.493
except for maybe Tiffany Tucker,

05:28.561 --> 05:32.063
who's got that nice mole on
her lip shaped like Idaho.

05:38.471 --> 05:41.806
Must be so hard saying
good-bye for a whole year.

05:41.874 --> 05:45.443
Looks like that kiss is
gonna last a whole year.

05:45.511 --> 05:47.245
I hate to admit it.

05:47.313 --> 05:50.415
I am so glad that he didn't
get into that program.

05:50.483 --> 05:53.618
I'd hate to have my child living
in a jungle in Central America.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.720
I think it will be a great
experience for Lauren.

05:55.788 --> 05:57.922
She gets to frolic in the
sun, pick some coffee,

05:57.990 --> 06:01.526
come back home with a nice
tan, and really wide awake.

06:05.231 --> 06:08.499
Well, that's it.
Lauren's on her way.

06:08.567 --> 06:09.868
How are you?

06:09.935 --> 06:11.703
I'm all right.
A little sad.

06:11.770 --> 06:14.406
Hey, of course you're sad.

06:14.473 --> 06:17.642
What you need is something to
take your mind off this, okay?

06:17.710 --> 06:19.511
You know, when I have
young girlfriends

06:19.578 --> 06:21.879
that leave me for the jungle...

06:23.683 --> 06:25.483
When something
bad happens to me,

06:25.551 --> 06:27.652
I go to the garage
and work on cars.

06:27.720 --> 06:31.790
When anything happens to you, you
go to the garage and work on cars.

06:31.857 --> 06:34.593
You know what's weird is that it was
my idea to apply to the program

06:34.660 --> 06:36.061
in the first place.

06:36.128 --> 06:38.262
Now she's going and I'm not.

06:38.330 --> 06:41.833
Things happen for a reason. I mean,
maybe Lauren was just meant to go.

06:41.901 --> 06:45.770
Yeah. You know how
the world works.

06:45.838 --> 06:47.705
They always favor the woman.

06:51.043 --> 06:52.710
What are you doing?

06:52.777 --> 06:54.778
I'm putting a scrapbook
together for Lauren.

06:54.846 --> 06:58.483
Each item represents some special
moment in our relationship.

06:58.550 --> 06:59.750
Pasta?

07:00.886 --> 07:04.022
Yeah. That's from
our first date together.

07:04.089 --> 07:07.025
Good thing you didn't have fish.

07:07.092 --> 07:09.527
Yeah. I'm gonna send this
to Lauren down in Costa Rica

07:09.595 --> 07:12.063
so she'll have something
that reminds her of me.

07:12.131 --> 07:14.132
Yeah, I think that's
really nice of you, Randy.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.968
Here. You should put
that in there, too, man.

07:17.036 --> 07:18.736
What's the significance of this?

07:18.804 --> 07:22.340
Nothing. I just didn't feel
like walking to the trash.

07:27.045 --> 07:28.179
Hello?

07:28.247 --> 07:31.148
Yeah, this is Randy Taylor.

07:31.216 --> 07:33.017
You're kidding!

07:33.085 --> 07:35.186
Oh, this is amazing!

07:35.254 --> 07:36.654
When?

07:36.722 --> 07:40.024
This is great! I'll tell my parents
right away. Thank you so much.

07:40.092 --> 07:42.160
Okay, bye.

07:42.227 --> 07:45.196
This is great. Lauren and I
are gonna be back together.

07:45.263 --> 07:47.799
What? They kick her out
of the program already?

07:47.867 --> 07:49.934
I get to go to Costa Rica!

07:50.002 --> 07:51.569
What?

07:51.637 --> 07:54.706
Yeah, some guy dropped out of the
program and they're giving me his spot.

07:54.773 --> 07:57.441
What? They expect you to just
pick up and go just like that?

07:57.509 --> 07:59.482
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm gonna
be living with a family

07:59.512 --> 08:02.246
in San Ramon, which is only 20
miles from where Lauren lives.

08:02.314 --> 08:03.515
I leave on Saturday.

08:03.582 --> 08:05.016
You can't leave Saturday!

08:05.083 --> 08:07.351
Well, why not? Well, because...
Because it's...

08:07.420 --> 08:09.454
It's the day before
the day of rest.

08:13.192 --> 08:15.031
Don't you need some time
to get stuff together?

08:15.061 --> 08:16.221
Yeah. You have
to get clothes.

08:16.262 --> 08:17.696
You have to get all those shots.

08:17.763 --> 08:21.365
Translate your records
into Costa Rican.

08:21.433 --> 08:25.603
Guys, I know it's kind
of a rush, but I can do this.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.138
You're sure you're okay with it?

08:27.205 --> 08:28.907
Yeah. It's all
the bananas you can eat.

08:29.041 --> 08:29.975
Yeah!

08:30.042 --> 08:31.342
- We're great.
- Yeah.

08:31.410 --> 08:32.543
No, we're really...
Excited.

08:32.611 --> 08:33.914
- We're happy for you, honey.
- Okay, cool.

08:33.945 --> 08:34.979
Great.
I'm gonna go pack.

08:35.046 --> 08:36.481
- We're really happy.
- Yeah.

08:36.548 --> 08:38.448
Really.

08:38.517 --> 08:40.884
I'm gonna be sick to my stomach.

08:40.952 --> 08:42.520
My child is going
2,000 miles away.

08:42.587 --> 08:44.388
I'm not gonna see him
for a whole year?

08:44.456 --> 08:46.228
Why is it that we agreed to
this thing to begin with?

08:46.258 --> 08:48.430
Because six months ago there
were hundreds of applicants.

08:48.460 --> 08:50.232
I mean, now they've picked him.
I can't believe it!

08:50.262 --> 08:53.564
Look, if you don't want him to go,
let's just tell him he can't go.

08:53.632 --> 08:55.667
We can't do that.
He'd hate us.

08:55.734 --> 08:57.835
He's a teenager.
He's supposed to hate us.

08:59.538 --> 09:01.439
- No.
- Why? What?

09:01.507 --> 09:03.040
We have to let him go.
We have to.

09:03.108 --> 09:04.279
His girlfriend's gonna be there.

09:04.309 --> 09:06.076
They're both really
committed to the cause.

09:06.145 --> 09:07.549
I mean, he's got
his heart set on it.

09:07.579 --> 09:09.547
So?

09:09.615 --> 09:10.919
When he was eight years old, he
had his heart set on that pony.

09:10.949 --> 09:12.617
- He never got that.
- Yeah, well,

09:12.684 --> 09:16.420
maybe if we'd given him the pony,
he wouldn't be going to Costa Rica.

09:16.488 --> 09:20.090
I still know that pony guy.

09:20.159 --> 09:22.360
I'll cut a deal with the guy.

09:22.427 --> 09:25.129
Oh, it's probably a horse by now,
wouldn't it be, 'cause it's...

09:27.032 --> 09:32.102
Poncho, insect repellent,
compass, hiking boots.

09:32.971 --> 09:34.505
What am I forgetting?

09:34.573 --> 09:37.275
You got underwear?

09:37.342 --> 09:41.379
Of course I have underwear. What
do you think I am? An idiot?

09:41.446 --> 09:44.482
Okay, I'm an idiot.

09:44.550 --> 09:47.885
So I bet you're looking forward to being
down there with Lauren alone, huh?

09:47.987 --> 09:50.255
Brad, it's not
gonna be like that.

09:50.322 --> 09:53.458
Lauren's chaperone is 6'2",
250 pounds,

09:53.525 --> 09:57.495
and she is very strict.

09:57.497 --> 10:00.632
Well, I think it's really cool you're
going down there to save the environment.

10:00.699 --> 10:04.135
You don't think I'm crazy
for doing this, do you?

10:04.203 --> 10:06.871
No, no. I don't
think you're crazy.

10:06.939 --> 10:09.307
I mean, I think it's
gonna be kind of weird.

10:09.375 --> 10:10.979
'Cause I figure that
by the time you get back,

10:11.009 --> 10:13.611
I'll probably be headed off
for college, you know?

10:13.679 --> 10:16.881
So this year would've been our
last chance to hang out together.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.884
Yeah. We could've done
some major partying.

10:19.886 --> 10:22.187
Well, I'm not really
the party guy, but...

10:22.254 --> 10:26.324
Well, I guess we could've
tortured Mark together.

10:26.392 --> 10:29.360
Yup. I am definitely
gonna miss that.

10:29.428 --> 10:30.928
Of course, you know,
if you want,

10:30.996 --> 10:35.166
I can score you some
Costa Rican itching powder.

10:35.234 --> 10:40.471
And if you do, I promise to send
you the pictures of Mark's rash.

10:40.539 --> 10:42.373
Hey, men. What are you
guys talking about?

10:42.441 --> 10:45.610
We're actually just talking about
Costa Rican itching powder.

10:45.678 --> 10:47.945
Hey, don't get me started,
all right?

10:48.013 --> 10:49.485
Years ago when you
wanted a good itch,

10:49.515 --> 10:52.917
you bought American,
all right? Yeah.

10:52.984 --> 10:56.787
We used to be proud of this country's
novelty products in my day.

10:56.855 --> 10:58.327
All right. I'm gonna go
write to my congressman.

10:58.357 --> 11:00.124
Good work.

11:00.192 --> 11:02.164
While you're at it, why don't
you tell him about the influx

11:02.194 --> 11:04.495
of that fake vomit from Japan?

11:04.563 --> 11:07.098
All the bean sprouts in there.
What's that all about?

11:12.037 --> 11:16.174
Now I know where I got
my global consciousness.

11:16.241 --> 11:18.075
Freakin' right, man.

11:20.378 --> 11:22.179
- Need any help packing?
- No.

11:22.247 --> 11:24.749
I think I got everything.
Oh, rain pants.

11:24.817 --> 11:27.918
I need rain pants. You think
Mom could pick me up a pair?

11:28.053 --> 11:31.889
I think your mom would stitch them herself
and drive them down there for you.

11:31.957 --> 11:32.824
What do you mean?

11:32.891 --> 11:34.425
Well, you know,

11:34.493 --> 11:36.699
she's having a little trouble
at the thought of you leaving.

11:36.729 --> 11:38.009
She didn't say
anything about it.

11:38.063 --> 11:39.802
I don't think she will. She
won't say anything about it.

11:39.832 --> 11:41.866
But, you know, she's
pretty worried about you

11:41.933 --> 11:43.934
living halfway around the world.

11:44.002 --> 11:45.570
Dad, it's no big deal.

11:45.637 --> 11:48.205
It's like I'm going to
sleep-away camp for a year.

11:48.273 --> 11:50.040
Except this camp,
instead of arts and crafts,

11:50.108 --> 11:53.478
you've got tarantulas
and man-eating fish.

11:53.545 --> 11:57.648
Not to mention the constant
threat of a peasant uprising.

11:57.716 --> 12:01.118
Dad, Costa Rica is the most stable
country in Central America.

12:01.186 --> 12:04.955
Oh, yeah. That's what they
said about Nicaragua.

12:05.023 --> 12:08.091
Now the people down there are
deprived of the most basic freedoms.

12:08.159 --> 12:11.995
You can't buy a Chevy big block down there!
You know that?

12:13.465 --> 12:15.799
And this bothers Mom how?

12:17.603 --> 12:19.537
I'm just saying that
she's worried, you know?

12:19.605 --> 12:21.539
I just wanted you to know that.

12:21.607 --> 12:24.275
Just the thought of you moving so
far away is eating her up inside.

12:24.343 --> 12:26.244
If Mom was so
worried about this,

12:26.311 --> 12:27.949
why did she let me apply to the
program in the first place?

12:27.979 --> 12:29.585
If she knew she was
gonna be this worried,

12:29.615 --> 12:31.286
I don't think she would've
let you apply to the program.

12:31.316 --> 12:33.951
Why are you telling me this now, Dad?
I leave tomorrow.

12:34.019 --> 12:35.686
I just thought it
might be interesting

12:35.754 --> 12:37.855
to find out how your mom
feels about it, that's all.

12:37.922 --> 12:41.058
Great. So either miss out on
the opportunity of a lifetime

12:41.126 --> 12:44.295
or turn my mom
into a basket case?

12:44.363 --> 12:46.230
So you've got options.

12:50.035 --> 12:51.269
Tah-dah!

12:53.172 --> 12:54.539
I went to camping stores.

12:54.606 --> 12:56.774
The totally mosquito-proof hat.
What do you think?

12:56.841 --> 12:58.142
Mosquito-proof hat.
Great.

12:58.210 --> 13:00.978
I'll be the only kid
in Detroit wearing one.

13:01.046 --> 13:02.213
What's that supposed to mean?

13:02.281 --> 13:05.082
You got your wish.
I'm not going to Costa Rica.

13:05.150 --> 13:06.317
Why? Why not?

13:06.385 --> 13:08.219
Why don't you ask
your middleman?

13:10.722 --> 13:12.590
What just happened here?

13:12.658 --> 13:14.658
It's okay. It's okay.
He'll calm down.

13:14.726 --> 13:16.427
Good news is our
son is now buying

13:16.495 --> 13:19.130
his itching powder
right in the US of A.

13:23.168 --> 13:24.669
Let me get this straight.

13:24.736 --> 13:27.037
Randy is not going
to Costa Rica because

13:27.105 --> 13:31.241
you told him that I was worried
about spiders and fish.

13:33.311 --> 13:35.350
And that you were worried
about him being so far away.

13:35.380 --> 13:37.715
I covered all the bases.
You don't need to thank me.

13:37.783 --> 13:39.083
Thank you.

13:39.150 --> 13:40.251
Well, you're welcome.

13:41.753 --> 13:43.387
Tim, I am worried
about him going,

13:43.455 --> 13:45.522
but I told you I wasn't
gonna stop him!

13:45.590 --> 13:47.592
That's why I stopped
him for you.

13:47.659 --> 13:51.062
Look, it doesn't matter who stopped him.
The point is he's not going.

13:51.129 --> 13:54.532
So he's gonna miss
this incredible adventure

13:54.600 --> 13:57.735
and spend the rest
of his life blaming me.

13:57.802 --> 14:00.438
You know, I thought you'd be
happy that I fixed things.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.973
Tim, this isn't a leaky faucet
or a broken carburetor.

14:03.041 --> 14:05.676
This is my relationship
with my son!

14:05.744 --> 14:08.078
I did not ask you to fix it!

14:08.080 --> 14:10.448
Not literally.

14:10.515 --> 14:14.718
But you were sending some very
strong subliminal messages.

14:14.786 --> 14:16.487
- Really? Well...
- Yes! Yes!

14:16.554 --> 14:21.192
Okay, so can you pick up on this message
that I'm sending you right now?

14:25.797 --> 14:28.866
That is not physically possible.

14:31.136 --> 14:32.336
Hey, Wilson.

14:32.404 --> 14:34.305
Hidey ho, good neighbor.

14:34.373 --> 14:35.673
What's all the smoke?

14:35.741 --> 14:37.375
I'm roasting Joe.

14:40.912 --> 14:43.347
Well, I don't hear any screams.

14:43.415 --> 14:45.783
He's obviously
taking it like a man.

14:47.286 --> 14:49.754
No, in honor of Randy
going to Costa Rica,

14:49.821 --> 14:51.889
I'm roasting coffee beans.

14:51.957 --> 14:53.424
Randy's not going.

14:53.491 --> 14:55.126
Why not?

14:55.193 --> 14:57.895
Because I told him
Jill didn't want him to go.

14:57.962 --> 15:00.130
So the trip is off
just like that?

15:00.132 --> 15:01.899
Jill must be very upset
about him going.

15:01.966 --> 15:03.634
The only reason I told him that

15:03.702 --> 15:05.574
was because Jill was worried
about his health and safety.

15:05.604 --> 15:07.309
I mean, he's not gonna be
home for Thanksgiving.

15:07.339 --> 15:08.477
We won't see him at Christmas.

15:08.507 --> 15:10.078
He won't be here
when I finish the hot rod.

15:10.108 --> 15:12.810
Oh. Uh-huh.

15:12.877 --> 15:14.749
He's gonna celebrate a
birthday down there, you know.

15:14.779 --> 15:16.347
If we want party pictures,
you know,

15:16.415 --> 15:20.351
I'll have to pick up a copy
of <i>National Geographic.</i>

15:20.419 --> 15:22.286
Well, I'm still
back at "ah."

15:22.554 --> 15:23.287
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

15:23.355 --> 15:24.588
Huh?

15:26.624 --> 15:28.458
Tim, have you ever
heard of a play...

15:28.526 --> 15:29.960
No, no, no.

15:30.028 --> 15:32.897
No plays, no ballets, no chamber music.
None of that.

15:32.964 --> 15:34.665
Just give it to me straight.

15:34.667 --> 15:38.336
I'm talking about the Shakespearean
comedy <i>As You Like It.</i>

15:38.403 --> 15:40.238
Now in this play,
the young Rosalind

15:40.305 --> 15:43.841
is uncomfortable expressing her
feelings for the nobleman Orlando.

15:43.908 --> 15:46.310
The only way she can
speak her mind

15:46.378 --> 15:50.781
is by dressing up as a man,
the shepherd Ganymede.

15:53.885 --> 15:59.189
Okay. What does a cross-dressing
sheep lover have to do with me?

15:59.257 --> 16:02.860
Well, I suspect, just as Rosalind
masqueraded as Ganymede,

16:02.928 --> 16:06.497
perhaps you were
masquerading as Jill.

16:10.569 --> 16:12.469
Once I tried on a pump.

16:14.673 --> 16:17.474
It was Halloween,
for God's sake!

16:17.543 --> 16:19.944
No, I'm talking about
masquerading your feelings.

16:20.012 --> 16:23.948
I mean, is Jill really the one who will
miss sharing the hot rod with Randy?

16:24.016 --> 16:26.350
Of course. She's the one...

16:29.187 --> 16:32.389
Are you suggesting I stopped him
from going because of my feelings?

16:32.457 --> 16:35.826
Well, that answer can only
come from the masquerader.

16:37.729 --> 16:39.463
All right, all right.

16:39.531 --> 16:42.066
I tried on the pantyhose, too.

16:45.070 --> 16:47.104
Hi.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.705
Hi.

16:48.773 --> 16:49.840
Is Randy back yet?

16:49.908 --> 16:51.675
No, he's not.

16:51.743 --> 16:53.410
When he gets back,

16:53.479 --> 16:56.981
I'm going to tell him that I'm
okay with him going to Costa Rica.

16:57.048 --> 17:00.618
And you might also tell him that it
was me that had the problem with it.

17:00.686 --> 17:03.020
I don't want him
leaving for a year.

17:03.088 --> 17:07.023
You were projecting your feelings on
me because you're in denial about him.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.964
You have all these emotions
you want to express to him.

17:08.993 --> 17:10.728
You just don't know
how to do it.

17:10.795 --> 17:13.501
Yeah, and if you could just tell him
that, you know, I'd call us even.

17:13.531 --> 17:16.233
Not gonna happen.
You have to do this.

17:17.234 --> 17:19.336
Randy, guess what?
Good news.

17:19.404 --> 17:22.705
Here are your rain pants.
You are going to Costa Rica.

17:22.773 --> 17:24.541
What? What's changed?

17:24.608 --> 17:26.410
Talk to the middleman.

17:29.147 --> 17:30.380
I don't get it.

17:30.448 --> 17:33.383
Well, it's complicated.

17:33.451 --> 17:36.086
Geez. Here.
Would you slice this for me?

17:40.492 --> 17:43.160
Do you remember
your first solid food?

17:43.228 --> 17:45.196
I was seven months old.

17:45.263 --> 17:47.731
So you do remember.

17:47.799 --> 17:50.134
Your mom tried to get you to
eat that wimpy rice cereal,

17:50.202 --> 17:52.903
but I gave you a bratwurst.

17:52.971 --> 17:55.539
No wonder I became a vegetarian.

17:55.607 --> 17:57.841
So why am I going
to Costa Rica again?

17:57.943 --> 17:59.443
It's complicated.

18:01.680 --> 18:04.047
How did you become 16 already?

18:04.115 --> 18:06.884
Well, I woke up one morning,
I was 15, and thought,

18:06.952 --> 18:09.486
"What the heck!
Let's keep on going."

18:09.555 --> 18:11.255
So back to the Costa Rica thing.

18:11.322 --> 18:14.424
Damn it, I'm gonna miss you.

18:14.492 --> 18:18.562
So you're the one who had
the problem with me leaving?

18:18.630 --> 18:22.233
The longest I've ever been
away from you has been a week.

18:22.301 --> 18:25.869
Yeah. And I visited you in the
hospital every single day.

18:28.606 --> 18:31.842
I'm just not comfortable about you
leaving like this, you know? We...

18:31.910 --> 18:35.279
We haven't gotten a chance to do half the
stuff I've talked about doing with you.

18:35.347 --> 18:37.281
Like what?

18:37.349 --> 18:40.117
We never souped anything up,
even a bicycle.

18:40.185 --> 18:41.819
Come on, Dad.
Don't you remember?

18:41.886 --> 18:45.456
I was the first six-year-old ever
to be pulled over for speeding?

18:45.523 --> 18:48.030
If you'd just ducked into that alley,
that cop would've never seen you.

18:48.060 --> 18:49.427
I know.

18:52.097 --> 18:54.031
You never talked about girls.

18:54.099 --> 18:57.034
Well, I'm not leaving until Saturday.
What do you want to know?

19:00.372 --> 19:03.774
I laugh with you. Boy,
I'm sure gonna miss you.

19:05.010 --> 19:07.411
Dad, I'm only
gonna be gone a year.

19:07.479 --> 19:11.949
Yeah. Yeah.
You can call, you know?

19:12.017 --> 19:13.388
You know, and then when
you get back we can go

19:13.418 --> 19:14.890
on that fly-fishing trip
we talked about.

19:14.920 --> 19:17.688
Yeah. I'd like that.

19:17.755 --> 19:20.858
You know, it takes a lot of courage
to go to a strange country,

19:20.926 --> 19:24.394
2,000 miles away. A lot of kids
would be scared to do this.

19:24.462 --> 19:27.397
Well, to be honest, I am scared.

19:27.465 --> 19:31.301
Yeah, I've talked to a lot of
people who've been down there,

19:31.369 --> 19:32.808
but I don't know what
I'm getting in for.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.304
Yeah.

19:34.372 --> 19:36.944
If you got any trouble or any
questions, I'm just a phone call away.

19:36.974 --> 19:40.177
So fill up those rain pants
with quarters, all right?

19:40.245 --> 19:42.412
- Thanks, Dad.
- Yeah.

19:42.480 --> 19:43.748
Oh, I'm gonna miss you.

19:43.815 --> 19:45.816
I'm gonna miss you, too.

19:45.884 --> 19:48.386
But you're gonna be just fine.
You're gonna do well.

19:48.453 --> 19:50.454
- You think so?
- Yeah.

19:50.521 --> 19:54.658
You've survived every
natural disaster known to man

19:54.726 --> 19:58.495
right here in this house.

19:58.563 --> 20:03.200
<i>Flight 557 will now begin
boarding through Gate 17.</i>

20:04.135 --> 20:05.168
Well, I guess this is it.

20:05.236 --> 20:06.269
Yeah.

20:06.338 --> 20:07.638
Have a good trip, Randy.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.206
Thanks, Mark.

20:09.273 --> 20:14.278
And here's the video I made of you
and Lauren making out in the gazebo.

20:14.345 --> 20:17.280
You're a very odd boy.

20:17.349 --> 20:18.482
But I'm gonna miss you.

20:18.550 --> 20:21.051
I'll miss you, too.

20:21.118 --> 20:23.854
You, I'm not gonna miss so much.

20:23.921 --> 20:25.389
Have a good trip, buddy.

20:25.457 --> 20:26.890
Save a tree for me, eh?

20:26.958 --> 20:29.025
You got it.

20:29.093 --> 20:30.126
Dad.

20:30.194 --> 20:32.062
I got you a little present.

20:32.129 --> 20:35.499
A recorder, so you can record your thoughts
in the jungle, send them back to us.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.634
We put some stuff
on there like this.

20:37.702 --> 20:40.303
<i>Wear your sun block.
Don't forget to write.</i>

20:42.173 --> 20:44.441
<i>Never look a monkey in the eye.</i>

20:47.879 --> 20:49.279
Thanks, Dad.

20:53.685 --> 20:54.752
Mom.

20:54.819 --> 20:56.787
I'm fine. I'm fine.

20:56.855 --> 20:59.423
I packed some snacks
in your backpack

20:59.491 --> 21:00.862
in case you don't like
the food on the plane.

21:00.892 --> 21:02.493
There's celery.
There's carrots.

21:02.560 --> 21:06.129
Or if you want to mix them together,
there's celery and carrots.

21:06.197 --> 21:07.664
I love you.

21:07.732 --> 21:10.401
I love you, too.

21:10.468 --> 21:12.469
You have a great time.

21:12.537 --> 21:14.905
And don't forget to write.

21:14.973 --> 21:16.407
Call when you get there!

21:16.474 --> 21:18.575
Call before you get there!

21:18.643 --> 21:22.546
Or I could open the emergency door
and just yell out of the plane.

21:40.998 --> 21:43.000
- That'll help.
- This helps.

21:50.308 --> 21:53.676
Costa Rica is the most stable
country in Central America.

21:53.744 --> 21:56.146
That's what they said
about Nicaragua.
