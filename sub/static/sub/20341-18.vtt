01:04.125 --> 01:05.416
Woo-hoo!

01:07.208 --> 01:09.291
Ground Control
to Major Bob,

01:09.291 --> 01:11.000
we're coming in for a landing!

01:11.000 --> 01:12.583
-(screeches)
-(grunts)

01:12.583 --> 01:15.083
(giggling)

01:15.083 --> 01:16.458
Another successful mission!

01:16.458 --> 01:20.166
I'm at the tourist destination,
Roy's Peak, where people
throughout the years

01:20.166 --> 01:22.583
claim to have seen UFOs.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.125
Unidentified flying objects?

01:25.125 --> 01:27.125
Space ships that travel
in outer space.

01:27.125 --> 01:29.708
This scientist has been speakin
today at Roy's Peak

01:29.708 --> 01:31.875
about the possibility
of alien life

01:31.875 --> 01:33.708
and other outer space travelers

01:33.708 --> 01:38.125
Oh, it's a possibility.
Outer space is quite
a large place.

01:38.125 --> 01:40.333
(gasps)
Hey! I'm rhymed!

01:40.333 --> 01:44.333
Ha-ha!
I wish I could meet someone
who's traveled in outer space.

01:44.333 --> 01:46.375
I'd love to know
what it's like up there.

01:46.375 --> 01:50.000
-Like an alien?
-Yeah. They're space travelers.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.333
(both barking)

01:51.333 --> 01:53.708
Well, I'm off to work.
I left you guys extra food

01:53.708 --> 01:55.583
because I'm gonna be
working late.

01:55.583 --> 02:00.750
Have fun!
And let me know
if you see any UFOs! Ha-ha!

02:00.750 --> 02:04.875
Bob was excited when he heard
there could be alien life
and other space travelers.

02:04.875 --> 02:08.333
We should help him
meet someone who has traveled
in outer space.

02:08.333 --> 02:10.291
Where are we going
to find one of those?

02:10.291 --> 02:13.375
So, if you're hoping
to catch a glimpse
of a space traveling alien

02:13.375 --> 02:16.583
or UFO...
check out Roy's Peak.

02:16.583 --> 02:19.333
That's it, Rolly!
We need to go there!

02:19.333 --> 02:22.458
Our mission is to find
a space traveler for Bob
to meet!

02:22.458 --> 02:24.708
This mission is going
to be out of this world!

02:25.875 --> 02:28.875
Now, let's find
our space traveler!

02:30.291 --> 02:32.333
Looks like we've come
to the right place.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.375
Rolly:
Either that's the biggest,
blinkiest dog dish

02:38.375 --> 02:40.958
I've ever seen,
or we just found...

02:40.958 --> 02:42.458
Bingo:
...a UFO!

02:42.458 --> 02:44.833
There's gotta be
a space traveler inside of that!

02:50.291 --> 02:51.750
Mm-mm!

02:51.750 --> 02:55.416
That UFO burger was
galactically good, Frank!

02:55.416 --> 02:58.333
Best on this side
of the Milky Way.

02:58.333 --> 03:02.250
Huh. From back there,
this looked like a UFO.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.458
But it's just a restaurant
shaped like one.

03:04.458 --> 03:07.500
It may not be a UFO,
but it sure smells delicious.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.000
(sniffs)

03:09.000 --> 03:10.500
Let's keep looking, Rolly.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.375
(gasps)
Bingo, look!

03:14.333 --> 03:16.625
That doesn't look like anything
I've seen on Earth before.

03:16.625 --> 03:18.458
It might be an alien!

03:20.500 --> 03:22.250
Take me to your leader.

03:23.750 --> 03:26.166
(laughs) You're
so silly, Todd.

03:26.166 --> 03:28.208
That alien looks
like a boy.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.000
That's because
he is a boy, Rolly.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.958
He was just wearing
an alien mask.

03:31.958 --> 03:33.416
Aw.

03:33.416 --> 03:36.458
I thought we had just found
our space traveling alien
for Bob.

03:36.458 --> 03:39.000
There's a lot of people here
wearing masks.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.208
If everyone here's a human,
how are we going to find someone

03:42.208 --> 03:44.208
from outer space
for Bob to meet?

03:44.208 --> 03:46.875
Welcome, humans, to another
intergalactic adventure

03:46.875 --> 03:49.458
with Space Dudes!

03:49.458 --> 03:52.291
Space sure is bumpy, eh, Jenson

03:52.291 --> 03:54.583
If there's anything bumpier,
I sure don't want to know
about it!

03:54.583 --> 03:57.291
But that's life
in a rocket for you.

03:57.291 --> 03:58.500
That's it, Rolly!

03:58.500 --> 04:01.500
If we wanna meet someone
from outer space,

04:01.500 --> 04:03.166
we would need to go
to outer space!

04:03.166 --> 04:04.750
We just need a rocket!

04:04.750 --> 04:07.458
And it looks like
we're in luck!

04:07.458 --> 04:11.000
Next stop, outer space!

04:11.000 --> 04:12.750
-Ready?
-Ready to rocket!

04:12.750 --> 04:16.166
Three, two, one,
blast off!

04:21.333 --> 04:22.875
Bingo, we have a problem.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.291
(clunks)

04:27.291 --> 04:28.583
Look, Bingo!

04:28.583 --> 04:31.250
Okay, that's gotta be
an alien.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.083
I do love my food.
Mm-mm-mm!

04:36.083 --> 04:37.875
-(barking)
-Wait!

04:39.458 --> 04:41.500
Are those two dogs
running toward me?

04:41.500 --> 04:42.583
How frightening!

04:43.583 --> 04:45.833
What do I do?
What do I do ?

04:45.833 --> 04:48.958
Uh, Todd? Todd?

04:48.958 --> 04:50.958
(grunts)

04:52.458 --> 04:54.250
Both:
Take me to your leader!

04:54.250 --> 04:56.500
(laughing)

04:56.500 --> 04:58.416
Todd! Todd, wait!

04:59.708 --> 05:02.083
Dogs! Gotta hide!

05:02.083 --> 05:04.125
-Aah!
-(grunts)

05:04.125 --> 05:07.208
So far, I've learned
that aliens eat dandelions,

05:07.208 --> 05:09.583
and that they like
to run really fast.

05:13.583 --> 05:16.583

06:09.583 --> 06:11.583
I saw him run back here.

06:11.583 --> 06:13.750
Look!
It's a dandelion.

06:13.750 --> 06:15.625
This is what
he was eating earlier.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.500
Here, Mr. Alien.

06:20.500 --> 06:23.083
I've got a delicious
dandelion for you.

06:29.458 --> 06:31.708
Ah!

06:31.708 --> 06:33.458
-Both: Hi!
-(screams)

06:34.458 --> 06:36.583
We're sorry
for scaring you,
Mr. Alien.

06:36.583 --> 06:39.291
Yeah! We were hoping
you could come meet
our owner.

06:39.291 --> 06:42.375
He'd be so happy to talk
to a space-traveling alien!

06:42.375 --> 06:45.291
Alien?
I'm not from outer space.

06:45.291 --> 06:46.875
I'm from Earth, just like you.

06:46.875 --> 06:49.958
We don't know anybody
on this planet who can
change colors.

06:49.958 --> 06:51.333
You've gotta be
an alien.

06:51.333 --> 06:52.416
Right?

06:52.416 --> 06:53.583
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

06:53.583 --> 06:56.875
My name's Orby,
and I can change colors
because I'm a chameleon.

06:58.166 --> 06:59.583
Watch this!

07:02.708 --> 07:03.750
Bow-wow!

07:03.750 --> 07:05.958
(sighs)

07:07.708 --> 07:09.583
Is something wrong, Orby?

07:09.583 --> 07:12.375
I just realized, I don't know
where my owner is.

07:12.375 --> 07:14.500
I think I'm lost.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.416
We'll help you find him.

07:16.416 --> 07:18.583
There's nothing sadder
than a lost pet.

07:18.583 --> 07:20.583
I'm sure we'll find him
out front.

07:20.583 --> 07:21.583
Come on!

07:29.708 --> 07:32.083
If I were Orby's owner,
where would I be?

07:32.083 --> 07:34.583
Hey, Orby?
Does your owner like
chewing dog toys

07:34.583 --> 07:36.708
and digging holes
in your yard?

07:36.708 --> 07:38.625
No. No, he doesn't.

07:38.625 --> 07:42.583
(giggles)
I guess those are more
Rolly kinds of activities.

07:42.583 --> 07:45.291
Hey, guys!
I think I found him!

07:46.500 --> 07:48.333
Orby! Orby?

07:48.333 --> 07:50.583
Hey, Todd! Todd!

07:50.583 --> 07:53.708
Orby? Where are you?

07:53.708 --> 07:56.958
He can't hear me.
He's too far away.

07:56.958 --> 07:58.833
We'll never catch up
to him now.

07:58.833 --> 08:01.250
We just need to find a way
to get you to your owner.

08:01.250 --> 08:02.583
And fast.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.458
Fast like a rocket!

08:04.458 --> 08:06.416
I know just what to do!

08:06.416 --> 08:08.875
But I thought
the rocket didn't work.

08:08.875 --> 08:11.208
That's because
it was moving too slow.

08:11.208 --> 08:14.375
A rocket needs to go
really fast to fly.

08:14.375 --> 08:15.500
I have an idea.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.291
Count us down,
brother.

08:19.291 --> 08:22.000
No time for counting!
Blast off!

08:22.000 --> 08:24.583
Shake the rocket
to make it go faster!

08:24.583 --> 08:25.583
Like this!

08:29.000 --> 08:30.750
It's working, Bingo!

08:32.416 --> 08:34.208
Orby:
And I see sparks!

08:34.208 --> 08:36.333
Sparks are always good, right?

08:39.375 --> 08:41.250
Now we're really rockin' it!

08:41.250 --> 08:43.250
All:
Wooo-hoo!

08:43.250 --> 08:44.750
Yeah!

08:44.750 --> 08:46.375
We're going to hit the rock!

08:46.375 --> 08:47.833
I can't get it to turn!

08:47.833 --> 08:49.250
Watch this!

08:54.708 --> 08:55.875
Way to to, Orby!

08:55.875 --> 08:56.625
(gasps)

08:57.625 --> 08:58.750
Watch out!

09:03.875 --> 09:06.166
(Bingo/Rolly giggling)

09:07.250 --> 09:09.083
Great work, Orby!

09:09.083 --> 09:12.583
Thanks, guys!
But we're not going fast enough
to catch up with Todd!

09:14.750 --> 09:16.458
There's gotta be something
we could do

09:16.458 --> 09:19.333
to make this rocket
go even faster!

09:19.333 --> 09:20.958
Both:
Let's lighten the load!

09:23.083 --> 09:25.000
-Whoa!
-Wow!

09:25.000 --> 09:27.875
Wow!
I don't know what you guys did,

09:27.875 --> 09:31.291
but this rocket just got
a whole lot faster!

09:36.875 --> 09:38.166
(gasps)

09:38.166 --> 09:39.583
(thuds)

09:43.958 --> 09:45.708
-Orby?
-Great goodness!

09:45.708 --> 09:47.000
-Oh, my!
-Orby!

09:49.708 --> 09:52.000
Todd!
I missed you, bud!

09:52.000 --> 09:54.583
Let's never get separated again!

09:55.583 --> 09:57.000
(laughs)

09:57.000 --> 10:00.458
I don't know what
just happened, but I'm glad
we found Orby.

10:00.458 --> 10:03.416
Yeah, I-- Wait, didn't
this used to be in front
of the diner?

10:06.875 --> 10:10.000
(groaning)

10:10.000 --> 10:11.333
You okay, Rolly?

10:11.333 --> 10:14.458
Yep. Rolling around's
my specialty.

10:14.458 --> 10:16.458
It is my name after all.

10:16.458 --> 10:17.875
Look!

10:17.875 --> 10:19.708
Orby's back with his family!

10:22.250 --> 10:24.416
(barking)

10:29.375 --> 10:32.958
It's starting to get dark.
Time for us to get back
to our family.

10:32.958 --> 10:36.083
I really wish we had met
a space traveler for Bob,

10:36.083 --> 10:38.750
but I'm glad
we made a new friend.

10:38.750 --> 10:40.583
(gasps)
Do you see that, Bingo?

10:40.583 --> 10:42.958
Lights!
And they're getting closer!

10:42.958 --> 10:46.750
Maybe it's a UFO
with space travelers
inside Bob can meet!

10:46.750 --> 10:48.458
We come in peace!

10:48.458 --> 10:51.208
Welcome, space travelers!

10:51.208 --> 10:53.458
Are they gonna
beam us up, Bingo?

10:54.958 --> 10:57.750
Hi, there. What are
you two puppies doin'

10:57.750 --> 10:59.750
all the way
out here?

11:02.000 --> 11:03.500
I'm gonna call your owner.

11:03.500 --> 11:06.125
-His number's
on your collars here.
-(beeping tones)

11:06.125 --> 11:09.833
Ah, I'm so glad
you're both safe and sound.

11:09.833 --> 11:13.958
I accidentally left
the gate open, and you
must've gotten out!

11:13.958 --> 11:15.875
We're glad to see you, too!

11:15.875 --> 11:19.125
Sorry, Bob, we wanted
to help you meet someone
who's traveled in space.

11:19.125 --> 11:20.583
Like an alien, but--

11:20.583 --> 11:22.833
(dogs barking)

11:22.833 --> 11:24.708
Thank you for calling me.

11:24.708 --> 11:27.375
I found these two
while I was about
to go stargazing

11:27.375 --> 11:30.458
with my telescope
up at Roy's Peak.

11:30.458 --> 11:33.416
I'm sorry, but you look
very familiar.

11:33.416 --> 11:35.333
-Are you--?
-Evy Taylor.

11:35.333 --> 11:36.583
Nice to meet you.

11:37.833 --> 11:39.958
Astronaut Evy Taylor?

11:39.958 --> 11:42.583
Oh! I watched every one
of your space missions

11:42.583 --> 11:44.708
on TV when I was a boy!

11:44.708 --> 11:48.125
I've always wanted
to meet someone who's traveled
in outer space!

11:48.125 --> 11:51.958
I can't believe it!
Bob is meeting a real
space traveler!

11:51.958 --> 11:54.708
We did it, Rolly!
Mission accomplished!

11:54.708 --> 11:56.875
High paw!

11:56.875 --> 11:59.375
Can you tell me
what it's like up there?

11:59.375 --> 12:00.875
In space?

12:00.875 --> 12:03.875
Better yet,
I can show you.

12:16.250 --> 12:18.000
(Rolly speaks)

12:19.625 --> 12:23.875
(digging noises)

12:23.875 --> 12:25.958
Did you find another buried toy
yet, Rolly?

12:25.958 --> 12:28.875
Nada. Nothing.
This hole might be a dud.

12:28.875 --> 12:30.500
Not gonna give up on it yet.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.958
Hey gu-- Mah--!

12:32.958 --> 12:36.166
Ohh-- Hole-y moly!

12:36.166 --> 12:38.000
What are you puppies doing?

12:38.000 --> 12:39.875
Just looking
for old buried toys.

12:39.875 --> 12:41.125
Wanna help?

12:41.125 --> 12:43.375
Uh-- Wha-- Wha-- Okay.

12:43.375 --> 12:45.250
I'm gonna go back inside
where it's quiet,

12:45.250 --> 12:47.083
and doesn't have flying dirt.

12:47.083 --> 12:50.208
Suit yourself.
But you're missin' out
on all this digging fun.

12:50.208 --> 12:52.083
I think I found a toy!

12:52.083 --> 12:55.583
It's really wedged in there.
Gotta use some Rolly power!

12:55.583 --> 12:58.000
(grunting)

12:58.000 --> 12:59.083
Whaah!

12:59.083 --> 13:00.083
(squeaks)

13:00.083 --> 13:03.708
Whoa...
that's a strange-looking
chew toy.

13:03.708 --> 13:05.375
I've never seen one
like it before.

13:05.375 --> 13:06.458
Me neither.

13:06.458 --> 13:09.083
It looks pretty chewy.
I'd better test it out.

13:09.083 --> 13:10.125
(squeaking)

13:10.125 --> 13:11.875
Hey, get back here, you!

13:11.875 --> 13:15.500
Huh. I don't remember
giving you guys a toy
like this.

13:15.500 --> 13:20.458
Hmm. I bet it belonged
to the dog who lived here
before we moved in.

13:20.458 --> 13:23.000
Mm, interesting design,
it looks well loved.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.250
I wonder if that dog misses it.

13:25.250 --> 13:30.000
Well, I gotta go to work.
Have fun playing with it
while I'm gone.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.750
(squeaking)

13:31.750 --> 13:34.000
I certainly see why a dog
would love this toy.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.708
It's chew-rific.

13:35.708 --> 13:37.125
(squeaking)

13:37.125 --> 13:39.166
Um, hey, Rolly.

13:39.166 --> 13:42.000
How would you feel if you lost
one of your favorite toys?

13:42.000 --> 13:43.708
(squeaking)

13:43.708 --> 13:45.958
You mean if I lost
Roger the squeaky duck toy?

13:45.958 --> 13:48.833
Or Sal the bouncy, fluffy
thinga-mabob?

13:49.875 --> 13:54.875
I'd feel like this:
oww-woo, oww oww ow-woo...

13:54.875 --> 13:58.500
I bet the dog
who lost this toy is said
about not having it anymore.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.375
I wish we could give it back.

14:00.375 --> 14:03.583
Poor doggie's probably
been howling for a long time.

14:03.583 --> 14:06.708
Ow-woo! Ow-woo ow-woo
ow-woo...

14:06.708 --> 14:08.875
Rolly, that's a great idea!

14:08.875 --> 14:12.208
Howling?
I mean it's sad, but it's
also kinda fun, right?

14:12.208 --> 14:15.416
I mean, our mission can be
to return this lost toy.

14:15.416 --> 14:18.125
How are going to find a dog
we've never met?

14:18.125 --> 14:21.958
I have an idea.
Rolly, we have a lost toy
to return.

14:21.958 --> 14:24.750
Come on, bouncy toy!
We're going to find
your owner!

before, because,

15:10.875 --> 15:12.875
it was a long time ago.

15:12.875 --> 15:16.000
But maybe the toy
can give us some clues.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.166
-(sniffing)
-Yeah! I love clues!

15:18.166 --> 15:20.708
-Well...
-(squeaking)

15:20.708 --> 15:22.625
It's a Bounce-A-Lot Chewer,

15:22.625 --> 15:24.458
-(squeaking)
-made o' really tough rubber,

15:24.458 --> 15:25.875
hard to make a mark in.

15:25.875 --> 15:29.166
-(squeaking)
-That rubber is tough.

15:29.166 --> 15:31.208
And look at all
those bite marks.

15:31.208 --> 15:33.958
Must mean the dog you're
lookin' for is strong enough

15:33.958 --> 15:36.000
to make marks
in tough rubber.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.458
-I know, right?
-So we're lookin' for a dog
who's really strong.

15:39.458 --> 15:41.583
There are lots of dogs
at the dog park.

15:41.583 --> 15:44.000
Maybe we'll find
a strong dog there.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.291
Good idea, Rolly.

15:45.291 --> 15:47.125
Thanks for your help, Bulworth.

15:47.125 --> 15:49.625
-Rolly, to the dog park!
-(squeaking)

15:49.625 --> 15:51.750
Good luck, pups!

15:51.750 --> 15:53.125
Rolly:
Busy day at the dog park.

15:53.125 --> 15:56.291
I hope one of these dogs
is the strong one
we're looking for.

15:56.291 --> 15:59.708
Wow!
I haven't seen a toy
like that in ages!

15:59.708 --> 16:03.083
Hey, Jackie!
Wait-- You've seen
this toy before?

16:03.083 --> 16:04.500
Sure have!

16:04.500 --> 16:06.458
Did you leave it in our house
before we lived there?

16:06.458 --> 16:07.958
Are you sad you lost it?

16:07.958 --> 16:11.500
Have you been all like,
Ow-woo, ow-woo ow-woo
ow-woo.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.458
(chuckles)
Sorry, Rolly, it's not mine.

16:13.458 --> 16:15.208
But you did say
you've seen it before?

16:15.208 --> 16:18.291
A while back, there was a dog
who used to come here a lot.

16:18.291 --> 16:19.958
Had a goofy ball like that.

16:19.958 --> 16:21.458
She was a gentle dog.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.500
-So she's a she.
-So we're lookin' for a dog

16:23.500 --> 16:26.333
that's strong, gentle,
and a girl.

16:26.333 --> 16:27.750
I wish you could talk
and tell us who--

16:27.750 --> 16:30.708
Watch out! Oopsie!

16:30.708 --> 16:32.708
Didn't see you there
until the last second.

16:32.708 --> 16:35.250
Where'd that disc
fly off to?

16:35.250 --> 16:37.166
And where did our ball
bounce off to?

16:37.166 --> 16:39.125
Bingo:
There! We can't lose it!

16:39.125 --> 16:40.708
After that ball!

16:40.708 --> 16:42.708
-(squeaking)
-Rolly:
Get back here, ball!

16:42.708 --> 16:44.750
That is a hard ball to catch!

16:44.750 --> 16:48.458
Hey!
The dog you're looking for
must've loved chasing things!

16:48.458 --> 16:49.708
Another clue!

16:49.708 --> 16:54.875
So she's strong, gentle,
a girl, and she likes
to chase!

16:54.875 --> 16:56.750
-(squeaking)
-Oooh!

16:56.750 --> 16:58.458
-Aha!
-Oh-whoa!

16:58.458 --> 17:00.208
It's getting away!

17:00.208 --> 17:02.083
-(squeaking)
-Hah! Puhh!

17:02.083 --> 17:04.208
Did somebody lose a bouncy ball?

17:04.208 --> 17:05.416
-Bingo/Rolly:
Hey, Dallie!
-Nice!

17:05.416 --> 17:09.000
Huh, chasin' bouncy toys
is one of my favorite things.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.333
Hey, I recognize this ball.

17:11.333 --> 17:13.500
-Is it yours?
-Oh, please let it be yours!

17:13.500 --> 17:16.250
Wait-- Dallie's not a girl,
so it can't be his.

17:16.250 --> 17:20.291
No, it's not mine.
But I remember the owners
of the dog it belonged to.

17:20.291 --> 17:23.250
Ah, used to come to the park
all the time.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.333
Then I think they moved
to the lake.

17:25.333 --> 17:26.500
Thanks, Dallie.

17:26.500 --> 17:28.250
Come on, Rolly.
Let's go to the lake!

17:28.250 --> 17:30.166
Aye, aye, captain!

17:30.166 --> 17:32.583
-See you around, pups!
-Good luck, bye guys!

17:32.583 --> 17:34.583
Both:
Bye!

17:34.583 --> 17:37.458

about the dog this toy
belongs to.

Wrah!

18:47.250 --> 18:48.500
(giggling)

18:48.500 --> 18:51.708

Maybe Scooter's the dog
we're looking for.

18:51.708 --> 18:54.416
She does really, really love
chasing that bouncy ball.

19:02.250 --> 19:05.708
That was fun!
Where'd the ball go?

19:05.708 --> 19:07.958
Well, she does love
chasing the ball.

19:07.958 --> 19:10.416
-But--
-She's not gentle at all.

19:10.416 --> 19:11.625
At all!

19:11.625 --> 19:13.500
-(squeaking)
-(giggling)

19:13.500 --> 19:15.583
I don't think she's the dog
we're looking for.

B-d-d-d-d-- (giggling)

19:17.375 --> 19:18.583

19:18.583 --> 19:20.875
-(bouncing noises, squeaking)
-Hey, Scooter!

19:20.875 --> 19:23.458
We need to take the ball back
now and find its owner!

19:23.458 --> 19:25.333
Look!

19:27.708 --> 19:30.250
Woooo!
(giggling)

19:30.250 --> 19:31.875
Let's keep looking
around the lake.

19:31.875 --> 19:34.958
The dog we're looking for
has to be around here somewhere.

19:34.958 --> 19:37.125
Awesome ball there.

19:37.125 --> 19:41.000
I'm Newf.
That ball looks awesome.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.958
Did I say that already?

19:42.958 --> 19:44.000
It is awesome.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.500
You can play with it
if you want.

19:46.500 --> 19:48.708
-(squeaking)
-(chewing noise)

19:50.875 --> 19:52.625
Maybe she's the dog
we're looking for.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.500
She does look strong.

19:56.416 --> 19:59.000
-And gentle.
-I wonder if she loves
chasing things?

19:59.000 --> 20:00.375
Scooter:
I love chasing things!

20:00.375 --> 20:02.416
Let's see!
Hey, Newf!

20:02.416 --> 20:03.458
Go long!

20:03.458 --> 20:06.458
Awesome!
That went far!

20:06.458 --> 20:07.708
Don't you wanna chase it?

20:07.708 --> 20:11.000
Nah, I'm fine with just
chewin' on this awesome stick.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.708
(chewing noises)

20:13.708 --> 20:16.458
I really do love this stick.

20:17.625 --> 20:21.833
Newf is strong, and gentle,
but she doesn't like to chase.

20:21.833 --> 20:24.833
Aww... which means she's
not the dog we're looking for.

20:24.833 --> 20:27.708
Rolly:
I don't see any other dogs
here at the lake.

20:27.708 --> 20:29.416
What if we don't find the owner?

20:29.416 --> 20:31.583
What if they just howl
forever and ever?

20:31.583 --> 20:34.000
Aw-woo woo woo woo...

20:34.000 --> 20:35.708
Rolly, we have a mission.

20:35.708 --> 20:38.375
And we never give--
Oh no! After that ball!

20:38.375 --> 20:40.875

20:40.875 --> 20:43.458

20:47.708 --> 20:48.708

20:51.875 --> 20:54.958
Come back here, you floaty,
bouncy ball!

20:54.958 --> 20:56.708
We're gonna lose it!

20:59.458 --> 21:00.416
I got it!

21:05.458 --> 21:08.166
-Bow wow!
-Nice!

21:08.166 --> 21:09.416
Bingo:
That was amazing!

21:09.416 --> 21:11.708
Thank you so much! Uhh--

21:11.708 --> 21:13.500
Daisy.
And you're very welcome.

21:13.500 --> 21:16.000
(shaking off water)

21:16.000 --> 21:18.083
Mmm!
I had a ball just like that,

21:18.083 --> 21:19.583
but I lost it.

21:19.583 --> 21:21.833
Oh, I could chase it
all day long.

21:21.833 --> 21:23.166
Really?

21:23.166 --> 21:25.208
(gasp)
Bingo! Look!

21:25.208 --> 21:26.625
New bite marks!

21:26.625 --> 21:28.583
Bingo:
That's one strong dog!

21:28.583 --> 21:30.750
-Mom!
-Mom!

21:30.750 --> 21:33.583
(laughs)
These are my pups!

21:33.583 --> 21:35.000
Dash and-- and Duke!

21:35.000 --> 21:38.250
-Mom?
-Can we swim too?

21:38.250 --> 21:41.000
Daisy sure seems
like a gentle dog.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.500
She's strong, loves to chase,
and lives by the lake.

21:45.500 --> 21:48.458
Rolly, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

21:48.458 --> 21:49.708
It's her! It's her!

21:49.708 --> 21:51.708
I think we found the dog!

21:51.708 --> 21:55.416
(gasp)
Daisy! This is your long lost
favorite ball!

21:55.416 --> 21:57.708
We found it this morning
in our backyard!

21:57.708 --> 21:59.833
Did this come
from a big back yard?

21:59.833 --> 22:03.000
Yellow house with a garden
and fences and a big ol' tree?

22:03.000 --> 22:04.083
Yes!

22:04.083 --> 22:05.500
Right near the dog park?

22:05.500 --> 22:07.000
Yes! Yes!

22:07.000 --> 22:09.250
That's where I used to live!

22:09.250 --> 22:11.083
(sniffing)

22:11.083 --> 22:12.500
It is my old ball!

22:12.500 --> 22:15.750
-Wow!
-Yes! We knew you'd be happy!

22:15.750 --> 22:18.458
I forgot I buried it
in the backyard
before we moved!

22:18.458 --> 22:22.000
Well, we found it
and brought it back to you.

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
-(giggling)
-(squeaking)

22:26.000 --> 22:27.458
You want in on this, Mom?

22:27.458 --> 22:29.625
(laughs)
Oh, absolutely!

22:29.625 --> 22:31.291
Thank you so much!

22:31.291 --> 22:33.375
All in a doggie day's work.

22:33.375 --> 22:37.500
(giggling)

22:37.500 --> 22:39.375
They sure look like
they're having fun.

22:39.375 --> 22:40.833
I think that means...

22:40.833 --> 22:42.583
Both:
Mission accomplished!

22:42.583 --> 22:43.583
High paw!

22:47.166 --> 22:52.250
(chewing noises)

22:52.250 --> 22:55.708
These toys are good,
but I'm gonna miss
that goofy bouncy ball.

22:55.708 --> 23:00.000
Yeah, but it was nice
seeing how happy Daisy was
when she got it back.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.625
-(bouncing noises)
-(giggling)

23:03.625 --> 23:05.708
-Hey, fellas!
-Bob!

23:05.708 --> 23:09.625
-(dogs barking)
-That old toy you found
this morning?

23:09.625 --> 23:13.333
It inspired me.
So I made something
that would be super bouncy

23:13.333 --> 23:15.458
and super fun to chew on!

23:15.458 --> 23:17.458
-Bouncy?
-Chewy?

23:17.458 --> 23:18.458
Both:
What are we waiting for?

23:18.458 --> 23:20.125
Hope you like 'em!

23:20.125 --> 23:23.708
-(dogs barking)
-(bouncing noises)

23:23.708 --> 23:25.708
-Thanks, Bob!
-Yeah, thanks!

23:25.708 --> 23:28.125
I'm gonna get you,
bouncy chewy ball!

23:28.125 --> 23:30.625
(laughing)

23:32.291 --> 23:35.708
(theme music playing)

23:35.708 --> 23:36.958
Both:
Bark! Bark! Bark!

23:41.166 --> 23:42.583
Both:
Bark! Bark! Bark!

23:43.750 --> 23:46.166
(record scratching)

23:52.208 --> 23:53.250
Both: Bark!

23:56.750 --> 23:58.375
Both:
Bark! Bark! Bark!
