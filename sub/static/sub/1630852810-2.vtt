12:06.434 --> 12:08.811
Okay, jerks. I'll admit it.

12:08.894 --> 12:13.023
Dagmar and I are a teeny,
kinda, sorta similar.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.984
-Wait, that's it!
-Don't hit me.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.945
I know how we can get out of here.
Follow me.

12:18.946 --> 12:20.406
Ugh, she's so bossy.

12:20.489 --> 12:23.576
What are you looking at?
Start walkin'! Come on, move it!

12:24.493 --> 12:25.327
Help, help, help.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.329
[blabbering]

12:33.586 --> 12:34.920
[shushes]

12:35.004 --> 12:36.464
[Dagmar snoring]

12:37.923 --> 12:40.384
[whispering] She's sleeping.
We gotta be quiet.

12:47.057 --> 12:48.017
[grunts]

12:48.809 --> 12:50.603
Oh, there you are.

12:50.686 --> 12:53.230
I'm ready for my evening massage, Caresso.

12:54.982 --> 12:55.941
[mouthing]

12:56.025 --> 12:57.359
[Dagmar] Get over here.

13:04.867 --> 13:08.496
You know I don't like to wait.
But you do know what I like.

13:08.579 --> 13:09.497
[Elfo gulps]

13:14.710 --> 13:16.337
[Dagmar] Oh, yes. Yeah.

13:17.588 --> 13:19.340
-Oh, that's good. Right there.
-[Luci] Hey!

13:26.472 --> 13:27.890
[whimpering]

13:28.807 --> 13:31.352
Caresso, stop panting.

13:32.019 --> 13:32.853
Oh, my God.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.397
[grunts and coughs]

13:36.106 --> 13:40.027
This is it. I'm running out of air.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.153
[breathing heavily]

13:41.237 --> 13:42.821
I'm gonna die for real.

13:44.615 --> 13:46.534
At least I'm in a coffin, God damn it.

13:47.576 --> 13:50.371
Goodbye, Beanie. Goodbye, Derek.

13:51.288 --> 13:52.581
I love you both.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.542
Goodbye, Vip…

13:55.209 --> 13:58.212
Vap, I'll see you in Hell.

13:58.295 --> 14:01.507
Goodbye, Dreamland. Sorry I was so loud.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.718
Sorry I never went out with a human.

14:05.594 --> 14:10.224
Most of all…
I wish I was a better king. I…

14:10.808 --> 14:11.934
[gasping]

14:13.102 --> 14:14.687
[exhales deeply]

14:20.192 --> 14:21.360
Whoa!

14:21.443 --> 14:22.528
[grunting]

14:26.699 --> 14:28.534
[screaming]

14:31.370 --> 14:32.872
[all screaming]

14:32.955 --> 14:37.710
I'm dead. I'm dead
and I'm in Hell. I'm in Hell!

14:37.793 --> 14:39.503
[grunting]

14:43.382 --> 14:44.884
[blabbers]

14:48.262 --> 14:50.598
Yeesh. I didn't order a king.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.309
Derek has found a special book

14:53.392 --> 14:55.936
and is afraid it says
his family is cursed.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.105
Oh, books lie all the time.

14:58.188 --> 14:59.481
If I believed a word of this,

14:59.565 --> 15:02.067
I'd be a quivering mass
of boneheaded jelly.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.945
Speaking of, it's almost time
for quivering mass. Now run along!

15:05.029 --> 15:08.449
Go wait in your churchy throne
like a good little ruler.

15:09.783 --> 15:12.244
Secret book of kings.

15:12.328 --> 15:15.289
[gasps] Someone's torn out the pages.
You don't think--

15:15.372 --> 15:19.168
If someone else is plotting without us,
I will be really miffed.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.337
[screaming]

15:21.420 --> 15:23.589
Hell is so fast!

15:24.882 --> 15:25.841
[yelps]

15:26.675 --> 15:28.677
And painful. [grunting]

15:30.012 --> 15:31.180
[blabbers]

15:32.264 --> 15:33.557
[Dagmar moaning]

15:39.438 --> 15:40.606
Right, on your feet.

15:41.690 --> 15:42.942
[exhales sharply]

15:43.025 --> 15:44.234
[clears throat]

15:44.318 --> 15:45.444
[chuckles nervously]

15:46.904 --> 15:48.572
Hmm. [grunts]

15:49.406 --> 15:50.991
-[Dagmar moaning]
-[grunting]

15:58.457 --> 16:01.126
Slip and slide, baby! Slip and slide!

16:01.961 --> 16:05.089
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

16:05.172 --> 16:06.924
-Right, you can stop.
-Aw.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.889
-Thank you, Elfo.
-[gasps and gulps]

16:25.109 --> 16:25.985
[Bean] Ugh.

16:26.068 --> 16:29.446
Aren't boots supposed to bend at the knee?
This is never gonna work!

16:29.530 --> 16:31.907
I should've made Elfo do it.
He's played Dagmar before.

16:31.991 --> 16:35.661
Hey, hey! Psst, psst. Down here.
Cons are all about confidence.

16:35.744 --> 16:38.914
I know you can do this.
I watched you march right into Hell.

16:38.998 --> 16:42.001
And badass Bean
is the Bean I wanna see right now.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.878
You're right! I am badass! [grunting]

16:46.964 --> 16:48.257
[groans]

16:53.762 --> 16:55.889
-[groans]
-Uh-oh.

16:56.473 --> 16:58.183
-[whispering] Say something.
-Um…

16:58.892 --> 17:00.477
Hey, how's it goin'? [chuckles]

17:01.562 --> 17:04.023
[whispering] No, like Dagmar, you rube!

17:04.106 --> 17:07.943
Oh. Right. Hello… Wait. [chuckles]

17:08.027 --> 17:12.990
[imitating Dagmar] Hello, darlings.
How doth it go with y'all?

17:13.824 --> 17:15.951
[whispering] Really?
That's the best you got?

17:16.035 --> 17:19.413
Why, I was just gliding about,

17:19.496 --> 17:23.500
thinking of something
devilishly evil to do.

17:23.584 --> 17:27.254
But it's so dreadfully gloomy down here.

17:27.337 --> 17:31.216
You know what would be really ever so fun?

17:31.300 --> 17:36.513
If we go up to the surface
and do something evil up there.

17:36.597 --> 17:40.350
But I can't seem to remember
how to find the stairs

17:40.434 --> 17:44.354
or the ladder or whatever
we usually use to get up there. [chuckles]

17:45.064 --> 17:49.818
You'd think with all the brains I eat,
I wouldn't be so forgetful.

17:49.902 --> 17:50.903
[chuckles]

17:51.445 --> 17:53.655
[laughs] Wrap it up.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.784
So could one of you be a dearie

17:56.867 --> 17:58.619
and, uh, show me the way up?

17:58.702 --> 18:00.079
Okie dokie, Your Highness.

18:00.162 --> 18:03.457
[in normal voice] It's working.
Maybe I am a lot like my mother.

18:03.540 --> 18:05.584
[imitating Dagmar] Thank you, suck-up.

18:05.667 --> 18:08.921
Where are you trying to be from?
I'm sorry, I can't place that accent.

18:09.004 --> 18:10.589
All right, let's go.

18:10.672 --> 18:12.591
[in normal voice]
We can't leave without Elfo.

18:12.674 --> 18:16.303
[imitating Dagmar]
Now, where is that little green bugger?

18:16.386 --> 18:18.514
He's right here.

18:21.100 --> 18:24.019
Bean, I love your new look.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.897
She's an impostor. I am the real Dagmar.

18:26.980 --> 18:29.399
-[gasping]
-She's lying. [stutters]

18:29.483 --> 18:34.530
[imitating Dagmar]
I'm obviously the real Dagmar, you twits!

18:34.613 --> 18:37.658
-I don't sound like that.
-I don't sound like that.

18:37.741 --> 18:39.159
-Do I?
-Do I?

18:39.243 --> 18:41.787
-That imitation is terrible.
-Oh, you're terrible.

18:41.870 --> 18:43.789
-How dare you, Bean!
-How dare you, Bean!

18:43.872 --> 18:47.084
-No, you're Bean.
-Who's Bean? I'm Dagmar.

18:47.167 --> 18:48.293
You're the Bean.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.045
-[Dagmar] Bean's the worst.
-Bean's the worst.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.005
-Bean's the worst.
-Bean is the worst.

18:52.089 --> 18:55.843
Well, no makeup could cover up
those freckles, darling, so…

18:55.926 --> 18:59.304
Well, you've still got
brain goo on your mouth.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.890
-Ridiculous accent.
-You're the Bean.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.892
I am so confused right now.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.311
You're a disappointment of a daughter.

19:06.395 --> 19:10.732
[stutters] Oh, yeah? Well, I'm your mother
and I have to love you.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.902
But I don't like you, darling.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.113
When you were little,
I tried to poison your father,

19:16.196 --> 19:21.201
but I should have poisoned you instead,
because all you do is mess things up.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.287
I didn't even want a child.

19:23.370 --> 19:27.457
I just had you to fulfill a prophecy,
and now I'm a jealous,

19:27.541 --> 19:31.378
manipulative mess
because you won't do what I say! Ow!

19:31.461 --> 19:35.340
At least I know how to complete something,
unlike my daughter,

19:35.424 --> 19:39.052
who never finished anything in her life
other than a pint of beer.

19:39.136 --> 19:42.431
-I'm not sure how this is helping.
-They're just being really hurtful.

19:42.514 --> 19:47.102
If I weren't the real Dagmar,
would I say this?

19:47.728 --> 19:49.271
I never loved you.

19:49.354 --> 19:50.689
[Trøgs gasping]

19:51.815 --> 19:53.734
I… I…

19:55.110 --> 19:59.281
It's settled. She is the real Dagmar.
Seize the impostor.

19:59.364 --> 20:00.949
[Zøg blabbering]

20:01.033 --> 20:05.412
Dagmar? What are you doing in Hell?
And other Dagmar, same question.

20:05.495 --> 20:07.456
-[in normal voice] Dad?
-"Dad"?

20:08.665 --> 20:10.209
How did you get down here?

20:11.710 --> 20:15.005
[imitating Dagmar] Um, did I say "Dad"?
I meant "husband."

20:15.088 --> 20:16.340
Noice.

20:16.423 --> 20:17.507
[indistinct chatter]

20:17.591 --> 20:20.761
I know you're not Bean, just a demon
that's been sent to torture me,

20:20.844 --> 20:23.096
but that's kinda what
I thought about you anyway,

20:23.180 --> 20:25.224
so you're okay by me, demon.

20:25.307 --> 20:27.893
You know what? I'm gonna call you Beamon.

20:27.976 --> 20:30.187
[sighs] It's been a long day.

20:30.270 --> 20:32.648
[in normal voice]
I couldn't get one normal parent?

20:32.731 --> 20:33.982
Dad, are you okay?

20:34.066 --> 20:37.236
Get away from me.
I told you I was the real Dagmar.

20:37.319 --> 20:39.404
Take my daughter back to the dungeon.

20:39.488 --> 20:43.450
And as for her two friends,
throw them in the lava pit. Deep end.

20:43.533 --> 20:46.203
Damn! You are not mellowing with age.

20:46.286 --> 20:48.956
-No!
-[Trøgs grunting]

20:50.040 --> 20:51.458
[Dagmar grunting]

20:55.087 --> 20:57.464
[all gasping]

20:57.547 --> 20:58.590
So much gasping.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.801
Look, the symbol.

21:01.468 --> 21:02.928
Not there, over there.

21:03.011 --> 21:04.554
[Trøgs] The symbol!

21:07.516 --> 21:11.103
This must mean the girl, the elf,
and the demon are the saviors.

21:11.687 --> 21:14.564
-[Trøgs] Welcome, saviors.
-[Bean] Saviors?

21:14.648 --> 21:19.069
Wait a minute.
She told us she was our savior.

21:19.152 --> 21:20.821
What should we do with the sexy impostor?

21:20.904 --> 21:24.199
-I don't care. Make her disappear forever.
-[both yell]

21:24.783 --> 21:26.451
-Tie her up.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:27.744 --> 21:30.289
Get your disgusting paws off me.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.961
Bean, don't do this to me.

21:38.005 --> 21:42.092
You know what, Mom? I used to love you,
but it was all in my head.

21:42.175 --> 21:44.511
And my heart. And now, those are empty.

21:45.137 --> 21:48.473
I'll never fall
for one of your tricks again.

21:48.557 --> 21:51.810
Bean, at least give me my crown.
It really doesn't suit you.

21:51.893 --> 21:55.230
Fine, I crown thee Queen of Lies.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.357
-[screams]
-[laughs]

22:00.736 --> 22:02.863
Ugh! She got me again.

22:02.946 --> 22:04.990
Man, she's got
that abandoning you thing down.

22:06.241 --> 22:09.244
[imitating Dagmar]
Show us the way out, darlings.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.079
[in normal voice] Uh, I mean,
get us out of here.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.414
You got it, bub.

22:13.457 --> 22:15.917
-Come on, Dad. Let's go.
-[groans]

22:20.255 --> 22:21.131
Up here.

22:21.214 --> 22:23.467
I ain't goin' back through there! Oh!

22:23.550 --> 22:26.011
Hey! [blabbers]

22:29.056 --> 22:33.018
Elfo! Before you go,
I've never had ladder sex before.

22:33.101 --> 22:35.062
Sorry, I don't have 30 seconds.

22:38.899 --> 22:41.568
Archdruidess, we have a problem.

22:41.651 --> 22:44.654
All these things ever see is a problem.

22:45.655 --> 22:46.698
[grunts]

22:49.034 --> 22:50.952
[closing theme music playing]
