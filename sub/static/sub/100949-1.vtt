WEBVTT

00:23.850 --> 00:27.980
I think it's time you
propose to my daughter, Harrison.

00:28.060 --> 00:31.520
You've proven yourself
as a top level executive,

00:31.610 --> 00:35.530
and it's time to, uh, move you
into the CEO position.

00:35.610 --> 00:37.760
Conrad, I'm honored
that you think of me this way.

00:37.780 --> 00:40.200
In fact, I'd hoped
this would be the end result

00:40.280 --> 00:42.240
of my time with Samantha.

00:42.330 --> 00:44.540
Her mother has already chosen
an engagement ring

00:44.620 --> 00:46.500
that she knows
is Samantha's taste,

00:46.580 --> 00:49.750
so that saves you
from that tedious task.

00:49.830 --> 00:52.040
Just put the ring on her finger

00:52.130 --> 00:56.630
and Cassandra will start
the wedding preparations.

00:56.710 --> 01:00.090
I'm not going to marry you,
so don't bother asking.

01:00.180 --> 01:02.720
I'm not a piece of property
that you can use

01:02.810 --> 01:04.720
to secure a business deal.

01:04.810 --> 01:06.470
Don't you think
you're over reacting?

01:06.560 --> 01:10.150
Hardly. I don't love you,
and you don't love me.

01:10.230 --> 01:11.980
I care about you, Samantha.

01:12.060 --> 01:13.150
That's enough for me.

01:13.230 --> 01:15.320
Well, it's not enough for me.

01:15.400 --> 01:18.110
I deserve better
and I will not marry you.

01:18.190 --> 01:20.780
Stop being so dramatic,
Samantha.

01:20.860 --> 01:22.090
The arrangements have been made.

01:22.110 --> 01:25.080
You and Harrison
will be getting married.

01:25.160 --> 01:28.040
Well, it's going to be hard to
have a wedding without a bride.

01:28.120 --> 01:30.620
- Where you going?
- I don't know.

01:30.710 --> 01:32.790
But I'm leaving this house
and I'm not coming back

01:32.880 --> 01:35.960
until you accept
that I will not marry someone

01:36.050 --> 01:37.510
that I don't love.

01:37.590 --> 01:39.170
If you walk out that door

01:39.260 --> 01:41.340
you leave with nothing
but the clothes on your back.

01:48.270 --> 01:51.270
Samantha, you can't leave.

01:51.350 --> 01:53.150
Why don't we have Maggie
make us a cup of tea

01:53.230 --> 01:54.250
and we can talk about this?

01:54.270 --> 01:56.070
There is nothing to talk about.

01:56.150 --> 01:58.280
I love you, mother,
but I won't be bartered

01:58.360 --> 01:59.530
in a business deal

01:59.610 --> 02:01.360
and I won't marry some man
I don't love.

02:01.450 --> 02:03.450
Don't be ridiculous, Samantha.

02:03.530 --> 02:06.330
You can't possibly mean
to leave all this.

02:06.410 --> 02:08.790
My life has to mean more
than this.

02:08.870 --> 02:10.370
You're not gonna get very far

02:10.460 --> 02:13.420
before you realize
what a huge mistake you've made.

02:13.500 --> 02:17.050
Well, that's a chance
I'll have to take.

03:40.750 --> 03:42.840
Taxi!

03:49.010 --> 03:50.760
- Hi.
- Where can I take you tonight?

03:50.850 --> 03:52.220
To your favorite bar.

03:52.310 --> 03:56.270
The place I go to
is a bit on the unrefined side.

03:56.350 --> 03:58.190
That's exactly
what I'm counting on.

04:02.320 --> 04:04.400
Last call.

04:08.530 --> 04:11.280
Tara, who's that cupcake?

04:11.370 --> 04:13.290
I have no idea.

04:13.370 --> 04:15.120
She slid onto the bar stool

04:15.210 --> 04:17.250
asked me for the dirtiest-named
drink on the menu.

04:17.330 --> 04:20.750
So I gave her a Royal Fuck.
She downs it in one go.

04:20.840 --> 04:22.380
Tells me to keep 'em coming.

04:22.460 --> 04:25.590
The stronger and dirtier
the better.

04:25.670 --> 04:27.890
Now she's going
to get Deep Throat.

04:27.970 --> 04:30.050
Thanks.

04:40.860 --> 04:43.150
- See you later, Saint.
- Goodnight, Ted.

04:43.230 --> 04:44.860
Charlie,
be safe out there, guys.

04:44.940 --> 04:47.030
Thank you.

05:00.960 --> 05:03.800
Hey, Tara, I got that,
you got a midterm tomorrow.

05:03.880 --> 05:06.260
Go home, study,
get a good night's sleep.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.050
Thank you, let me get the blonde

05:08.130 --> 05:09.610
to close out her tab
and then I'll head out.

05:09.630 --> 05:11.280
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of her.

05:11.300 --> 05:12.810
Of course you will, St. Clay.

05:12.890 --> 05:14.140
I will take care of her

05:14.220 --> 05:16.060
like I would any other
tipsy patron.

05:16.140 --> 05:18.270
She will pay her tab,
I will call her a cab.

05:18.350 --> 05:20.150
The cab will take her home.

05:20.230 --> 05:21.940
Making sure she gets home safely

05:22.020 --> 05:24.400
is all part of my responsibility
as the owner of this bar.

05:24.480 --> 05:25.530
Nothing more.

05:25.610 --> 05:27.570
Justify it all you want,
St. Clay.

05:27.650 --> 05:29.860
- But you're a good guy.
- Goodnight, Tara.

05:29.940 --> 05:31.200
See you tomorrow.

05:31.280 --> 05:33.120
Elijah, walk Tara to her car

05:33.200 --> 05:35.660
on your way out. Thanks, buddy.
Good work today.

05:35.740 --> 05:37.830
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:55.850 --> 05:57.470
You...

05:59.600 --> 06:03.190
You are so freaking hot.

06:04.570 --> 06:09.570
I think that I need another
Royal Fuck.

06:15.160 --> 06:19.710
Or maybe you can give me
a Screaming Orgasm.

06:19.790 --> 06:24.170
You know, I have never asked
a guy for a Screaming Orgasm.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.590
But this one was so good,

06:26.670 --> 06:28.170
that I think I need another.

06:28.250 --> 06:30.210
I think you've had enough
Royal Fucks

06:30.300 --> 06:32.760
and Screaming Orgasms
for one night, cupcake.

06:32.840 --> 06:34.930
Cupcake? I love cupcakes.

06:35.010 --> 06:37.890
I love to eat them
and I love to make them

06:37.970 --> 06:41.310
and when no one's looking
I like to lick the frosting.

06:48.730 --> 06:52.780
That, uh,
that Blow Job was very,

06:52.860 --> 06:55.530
very ta... tasty too.

06:55.620 --> 06:57.580
So maybe I could have another
one of those.

06:57.660 --> 07:00.410
I'm sorry, but the bar is
closed. And it's getting late.

07:00.500 --> 07:01.780
So if you like to settle
your tab

07:01.830 --> 07:03.920
maybe we can get you
on your way home.

07:05.670 --> 07:07.920
Yeah. Ooh.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.090
- Ooh.
- Ah.

07:10.460 --> 07:12.550
Careful with your bag.

07:15.760 --> 07:17.850
Thank you.

07:26.150 --> 07:28.070
It didn't work, did it?

07:28.150 --> 07:30.690
No, do you have another form
of payment you'd like to use?

07:30.780 --> 07:32.860
Nope, none of them will work.

07:32.940 --> 07:34.400
He actually did it.

07:34.490 --> 07:38.200
My father completely cut me off.

07:41.290 --> 07:45.330
This room is starting to spin
and I...

07:45.410 --> 07:48.040
I think your face
is getting a little fuzzy.

07:48.130 --> 07:51.130
Uh, Samantha, maybe I can have
your cell phone

07:51.210 --> 07:52.210
and I can call somebody.

07:52.250 --> 07:53.630
Nope. I got rid of it.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.130
I don't want my father
to find out where I am.

07:56.220 --> 07:58.600
Okay. Okay.
Well, um, can I see your ID?

07:58.680 --> 08:00.640
I can look up your address,

08:00.720 --> 08:02.520
and have somebody
take you home, it's okay.

08:02.600 --> 08:06.480
No, no, no. I-I can't go home.
Don't make me go home.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.310
Oh.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.190
Oh, my God, what did I just do?

08:11.270 --> 08:14.360
I don't have anything.
I don't have any money.

08:14.440 --> 08:17.410
I have nowhere to go.

08:17.490 --> 08:20.530
Whoa.
Oh, it's okay, it's alright.

08:20.620 --> 08:23.870
I don't know,
I don't know what to do.

08:23.950 --> 08:27.670
I'm so tired
and I don't know what to do.

08:27.750 --> 08:31.880
It's okay. Oh, alright,
alright. Okay.

08:31.960 --> 08:34.470
Okay, it's alright.
It's... No, no, no.

08:34.550 --> 08:36.550
It's okay. It's alright.
Careful, careful.

08:36.630 --> 08:39.010
There is stairs here. Okay?
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

08:39.090 --> 08:40.550
- So...
- Just... No, it's okay.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.850
- Take a step. Alright...
- Whoo!

08:42.930 --> 08:44.350
Alright, alright.

08:44.430 --> 08:46.350
Alright, hang on, hang on.
Hang on a second.

08:46.430 --> 08:48.650
Okay, we're just going to walk
you straight back there.

08:48.730 --> 08:51.400
To the couch, okay?
Okay? Just to the couch.

08:51.480 --> 08:53.940
Come on. You okay?

08:54.030 --> 08:56.740
- I fell kinda dizzy.
- Okay, it's alright. Hang on.

08:56.820 --> 08:58.240
- It's okay?
- I don't feel so good.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.450
Okay, come on, cupcake.

08:59.530 --> 09:00.720
You and me are going to
the bathroom.

09:00.740 --> 09:03.450
Let's go. Hang on. Hang on.

09:03.540 --> 09:06.620
Okay. It's alright.
It's alright. There you go.

09:06.710 --> 09:09.750
Hey, you're okay.
It's alright. It's alright.

09:09.830 --> 09:12.630
Okay. It's okay.

09:12.710 --> 09:16.260
That was disgusting.

09:16.340 --> 09:18.170
I know I'm all messy.

09:18.260 --> 09:20.050
Oh, yeah, you're a hot mess
alright.

09:20.130 --> 09:22.810
No, you're a hot mess.

09:22.890 --> 09:24.220
There we go.

09:24.310 --> 09:29.310
I think that I need
to take a shower. Oh!

09:29.390 --> 09:30.900
I need to take a shower.

09:30.980 --> 09:32.020
Okay, I tell you what.

09:32.110 --> 09:33.570
How about I give you
a fresh shirt

09:33.650 --> 09:35.480
and you can lay down on my bed
and take a nap?

09:35.570 --> 09:37.230
No, I stink.

09:37.320 --> 09:40.110
Oh, yeah, you do.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.700
There is stuff in my hair.

09:41.780 --> 09:43.490
And if I don't get a shower,

09:43.580 --> 09:45.580
I'm gonna be sick again
from that smell.

09:45.660 --> 09:47.410
Okay. Okay.

09:47.500 --> 09:49.710
Now let me take this off,
alright?

09:49.790 --> 09:51.170
There we go.

09:51.250 --> 09:53.540
Oh... Leave it.

09:53.630 --> 09:55.880
- No, I need to take...
- No, no!

09:55.960 --> 09:58.420
Well, you don't have to be
so grumpy.

09:58.510 --> 10:01.340
Okay, there we go.

10:02.680 --> 10:04.760
You're so cute.

10:06.180 --> 10:07.730
Okay, let's get the jewelry off.

10:07.810 --> 10:10.310
Okay.

10:10.390 --> 10:12.480
There we go.

10:14.110 --> 10:16.530
Just gonna get your watch off
too, is that okay?

10:16.610 --> 10:18.860
There we go.

10:18.940 --> 10:21.030
Okay.

10:21.650 --> 10:25.660
You are so freaking hot.

10:28.790 --> 10:32.580
Alright, cupcake, let's do this.

10:32.670 --> 10:34.960
- We're gonna do it?
- No, no.

10:35.040 --> 10:37.230
We're gonna take a shower and
I'm not letting you get in there

10:37.250 --> 10:39.670
when you can barely stand up
on your own. Come on.

11:40.150 --> 11:42.440
Just gonna put on a shirt, okay?

11:42.530 --> 11:45.030
I got you, I got you.
Stand right here.

11:45.110 --> 11:47.950
Alright, okay. You good?

11:48.030 --> 11:49.990
Good. Look at that.
I'm just gonna...

11:50.080 --> 11:53.960
Hang on one second.
I'm just gonna take your...

11:54.040 --> 11:56.580
I'm gonna take this off.
There we go.

11:56.670 --> 11:58.750
Good, good, good. Okay.

12:01.210 --> 12:03.300
Okay.

12:05.260 --> 12:06.800
Okay, I'm at the...

12:06.890 --> 12:09.100
I'm gonna take these off now.
It's alright.

12:09.180 --> 12:11.260
Okay.

12:15.190 --> 12:17.020
- Okay, let us go over here.
- Okay.

12:17.100 --> 12:19.360
Alright.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.530
I got you.

12:22.990 --> 12:25.070
I got you. There you go.

12:37.040 --> 12:39.130
Thank you for taking care of me.

13:16.370 --> 13:18.460
Hm.

13:50.660 --> 13:52.700
I think you've
had enough Royal Fucks

13:52.780 --> 13:54.870
and Screaming Orgasms
for one night, cupcake.

15:52.110 --> 15:53.820
Good morning.

15:53.900 --> 15:56.160
Hi.

15:56.240 --> 15:58.330
Have a seat.

15:59.740 --> 16:01.950
How are you feeling?

16:02.040 --> 16:03.750
Better than last night.

16:03.830 --> 16:06.290
But my pounding head,

16:06.370 --> 16:09.840
and my sore body are clearly
protesting all the drinks

16:09.920 --> 16:11.630
I indulged in.

16:11.710 --> 16:12.840
Yeah.

16:17.470 --> 16:19.550
You're definitely a cupcake.

16:20.850 --> 16:22.180
Why do you keep calling me that?

16:22.270 --> 16:23.390
Because you're a lightweight

16:23.430 --> 16:25.390
and you can't handle
your liquor.

16:25.480 --> 16:27.560
- Coffee?
- Sure.

16:28.310 --> 16:29.940
Mm.

16:30.020 --> 16:32.190
- Cream, if you have it.
- I sure do.

16:36.820 --> 16:38.700
Oh, you're gonna need something
in your stomach.

16:38.740 --> 16:40.700
Made you some toast.

16:40.780 --> 16:42.870
Thanks.

16:43.660 --> 16:46.910
I don't even know your name.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.750
I'm Clay. Clay Kincaid.

16:51.170 --> 16:53.960
I'm Samantha.

16:54.050 --> 16:55.800
So the bar is yours?

16:55.880 --> 16:57.970
Yeah.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.890
How did your cat lose it's eye?

17:02.970 --> 17:05.680
Found her out behind the bar
when she was just a kitten.

17:05.770 --> 17:07.650
That left eye
was pretty infected.

17:07.730 --> 17:09.350
The vet had no choice
but to take the eye

17:09.440 --> 17:10.860
and stitch it shut.

17:10.940 --> 17:12.190
And you kept her.

17:12.270 --> 17:14.150
Yeah. She needed a home.

17:14.230 --> 17:18.570
I... I'm really sorry
about last night.

17:19.780 --> 17:21.740
On which part?

17:21.830 --> 17:23.740
Well, all of it,
but especially the part

17:23.830 --> 17:25.160
where I got sick.

17:25.250 --> 17:27.500
And you had to deal with me
staying here

17:27.580 --> 17:30.880
because I have
nowhere else to go.

17:30.960 --> 17:33.050
Where do you plan on going
this morning?

17:35.420 --> 17:40.180
I don't know.
But I'm not going back home.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.900
Samantha, are you in some kind
of trouble?

17:41.930 --> 17:43.650
Last night you said something
about your dad

17:43.680 --> 17:45.780
cutting you off and you had to
get rid of your cell phone

17:45.810 --> 17:47.330
because you were afraid
somebody was gonna find you?

17:47.350 --> 17:48.640
Yeah, I know that sounds bad.

17:48.730 --> 17:50.480
Um, I'm not in any trouble.

17:50.560 --> 17:53.270
And I'm not in any danger.

17:53.360 --> 17:54.440
But it is true that

17:54.530 --> 17:55.610
I don't want my father

17:55.690 --> 17:57.740
to know where I am.

17:57.820 --> 17:59.530
Why not?

18:02.160 --> 18:05.160
Have you ever heard
of Jameson Global?

18:06.750 --> 18:08.540
Oh...

18:08.620 --> 18:10.710
You're Samantha Jameson.

18:12.210 --> 18:15.090
Last night I found out that
my father expects me

18:15.170 --> 18:16.690
to marry a man,
that I have been dating

18:16.710 --> 18:18.010
for the past eight months.

18:18.090 --> 18:20.720
His name
is Harrison Blackwell III.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.390
And my father has been
grooming him to be CEO

18:23.470 --> 18:25.030
which apparently comes
with the stipulation

18:25.050 --> 18:26.430
of Harrison marrying me

18:26.510 --> 18:28.100
to keep the company
in the family.

18:28.180 --> 18:29.580
And you're upset
that he'll be marrying you

18:29.600 --> 18:30.850
for a promotion.

18:30.940 --> 18:32.190
No, I'm furious that my father

18:32.270 --> 18:33.560
is demanding that I marry

18:33.650 --> 18:35.190
someone that I don't love.

18:35.270 --> 18:36.900
- Demanding?
- Yes.

18:36.980 --> 18:39.440
Demanding as in, not giving me
a choice in the matter,

18:39.530 --> 18:41.530
and expecting me to fall in line
with his wishes

18:41.610 --> 18:43.700
and do as I'm told.

18:45.030 --> 18:47.370
Being the daughter
of Conrad Jameson

18:47.450 --> 18:49.330
comes with a certain
obligations,

18:49.410 --> 18:53.580
one of which is obviously
an arranged marriage.

18:53.670 --> 18:55.250
I won't let anyone dictate
who I spend

18:55.330 --> 18:58.550
the rest of my life with,
especially not my father.

18:59.670 --> 19:01.420
So you ran away from home?

19:04.140 --> 19:06.050
That sounds so juvenile,

19:06.140 --> 19:08.680
but yes, that is 100% accurate.

19:10.980 --> 19:13.770
Honestly, I should have left
a long time ago

19:13.850 --> 19:16.570
and I hate that I have let my
parents run my life this long.

19:19.570 --> 19:23.910
Okay, so now that you ran away,
what do you plan on doing?

19:26.410 --> 19:28.870
I don't know. I didn't...

19:28.950 --> 19:32.540
I didn't really have a plan
beyond getting away.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.380
I know this is more than
I have the right to ask,

19:39.460 --> 19:43.010
but could I stay here?

19:43.090 --> 19:44.340
Until I figure things out.

19:44.430 --> 19:45.430
I won't be in your way

19:45.470 --> 19:46.760
and I can sleep on your couch

19:46.850 --> 19:48.600
and I swear you won't even know
I am here.

19:48.680 --> 19:51.390
I have no money,
no place to stay

19:51.470 --> 19:55.150
I can't even buy a meal,
or a hotel room.

19:55.230 --> 19:57.230
Obviously I didn't think things
through last night,

19:57.310 --> 19:58.420
but I don't regret leaving home

19:58.440 --> 19:59.440
and I'm determined

19:59.480 --> 20:01.570
to make it on my own.

20:02.110 --> 20:04.450
I could work in your bar,

20:04.530 --> 20:06.660
and make some money
until I have enough

20:06.740 --> 20:09.790
to get a place of my own,
which shouldn't take too long.

20:13.460 --> 20:15.540
Please.

20:16.960 --> 20:19.040
Uh, Samantha, I don't think
that is such a good idea.

20:19.130 --> 20:22.300
Please, Clay, I just need
someone to give me the chance

20:22.380 --> 20:24.470
to prove myself.

20:35.140 --> 20:39.900
Okay. Consider yourself hired
as a bar waitress.

20:39.980 --> 20:42.190
You can start tonight
and you can stay here

20:42.270 --> 20:45.570
until you can figure out
a place of your own.

20:45.650 --> 20:47.590
I'm gonna call Katrina,
she's my brother's best friend.

20:47.610 --> 20:51.240
She'll take you shopping
for some clothes and toiletries.

20:51.330 --> 20:54.000
I will pay you back
for everything.

20:56.910 --> 20:59.000
Mm. Thank you.

21:09.890 --> 21:11.970
Thank you, Clay.

21:44.710 --> 21:50.840
You are playing with the hottest
kinda fire there is, cupcake.

21:50.930 --> 21:53.470
Well, you didn't seem to mind
a few moments ago.

21:57.890 --> 22:00.600
I'm not a gentleman, Samantha.

22:00.690 --> 22:03.400
I don't do soft and gentle
and sweet.

22:04.650 --> 22:07.820
I like to control
and fuck so hard

22:07.900 --> 22:11.780
and deep that you'll scream
and be sore the next day.

22:13.530 --> 22:16.540
What, what if that's
what I want?

22:19.040 --> 22:21.540
That's not gonna happen.

22:21.630 --> 22:24.000
If you're gonna be staying here
we need to set some rules.

22:24.090 --> 22:25.590
I'm 26 years old

22:25.670 --> 22:28.630
and I have spent my entire life
following rules.

22:28.720 --> 22:31.010
I am done with rules.

22:31.090 --> 22:33.550
I'm done being a straight-laced
good girl,

22:33.640 --> 22:39.020
and the woman in me
wants passion and excitement

22:39.100 --> 22:41.190
and a man that can give me both.

22:44.230 --> 22:47.030
I'm not that man.

22:47.110 --> 22:48.420
And you're being wild
and rebellious

22:48.440 --> 22:50.740
now that you got
a little freedom.

22:50.820 --> 22:54.070
And you like the way
that it feels.

22:54.160 --> 22:56.200
But there is no way
I'm gonna let you do something

22:56.280 --> 22:58.370
that you're going to regret.

23:13.510 --> 23:16.260
Thank you so much
for the dress and the shoes.

23:16.350 --> 23:18.220
Yeah, it's not a problem.

23:18.310 --> 23:20.390
Though I have to say,
I've never known Clay

23:20.480 --> 23:22.160
to let a woman spend the night
at his place,

23:22.190 --> 23:23.520
let alone move in so quickly.

23:23.600 --> 23:25.900
Oh, well, I'm only
staying here temporarily,

23:25.980 --> 23:27.170
until I figure some things out.

23:27.190 --> 23:29.150
I know the whole Clay thing,

23:29.230 --> 23:32.320
staying with him and working at
the bar, it seems odd.

23:32.400 --> 23:35.620
Oh, it's not odd at all.
That's what St. Clay does.

23:35.700 --> 23:38.990
He takes care of people.
We gotta get going.

23:39.080 --> 23:42.210
I have two hours until Mason
expects me back at the shop.

23:42.290 --> 23:44.350
But honestly, he can kiss my ass
for making such a demand.

23:44.370 --> 23:46.000
I'm not his personal slave.

23:46.080 --> 23:49.170
- Mason?
- That's one of Clay's brothers.

23:49.250 --> 23:52.090
And then there is also Levi,
the youngest of the three.

23:52.170 --> 23:55.090
- Are they close?
- Yeah, they're really close.

23:55.180 --> 23:57.640
The three of them have been
through so much shit together,

23:57.720 --> 23:59.930
there is nothing
they wouldn't do for each other.

24:00.010 --> 24:01.650
Yeah, I met
Mason when I was 14.

24:01.730 --> 24:04.310
And we, we went
to the same high school.

24:04.390 --> 24:05.980
We bonded over
something in common.

24:06.060 --> 24:08.310
And we've pretty much been
best friends since.

24:08.400 --> 24:11.110
- So you guys work together now?
- I work for him.

24:11.190 --> 24:13.050
He owns a tattoo shop
a few streets over, Inked.

24:14.030 --> 24:15.610
I manage the place,
do accounting

24:15.700 --> 24:18.580
and pretty much
keep his shit together.

24:18.660 --> 24:20.410
Occasionally I draw art work
for clients,

24:20.490 --> 24:22.410
but I don't do
the actual tattooing.

24:22.500 --> 24:25.170
Oh, did Mason do
all those butterflies?

24:25.250 --> 24:28.420
Um, no, somebody else did.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.710
- Well, they're beautiful.
- Thank you.

24:33.260 --> 24:35.550
Come on, let's spend
some Clay's money.

24:35.630 --> 24:37.010
I just need the basics

24:37.090 --> 24:39.550
to get me through
my first pay check.

24:39.640 --> 24:40.740
Oh, trust me, you're going
to have money

24:40.760 --> 24:42.060
before your first paycheck.

24:42.140 --> 24:44.060
A pair of tight fitted jeans,

24:44.140 --> 24:45.350
to wear with a Kincaid t-shirt

24:45.430 --> 24:47.080
and I guarantee the guys
coming to the bar

24:47.150 --> 24:48.580
are going to be throwing tips
your way.

24:48.610 --> 24:50.690
Okay.

24:55.150 --> 24:56.700
What the hell is she doing here?

24:56.780 --> 24:58.320
And why is she wearing
a bar uniform?

24:58.410 --> 25:00.070
Because she needed a job.

25:00.160 --> 25:01.680
And since everybody is going
to find out anyway,

25:01.700 --> 25:03.790
yes, she is staying with me
in my apartment

25:03.870 --> 25:05.000
for the next week or so.

25:05.080 --> 25:07.580
You've got to be joking.

25:07.670 --> 25:08.980
I thought you were just going
to help her out,

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
like any other tipsy bar patron.

25:11.090 --> 25:14.170
Make sure she got home
and all that.

25:14.260 --> 25:17.260
Hey, I'm ready to get started.
Where do you need me?

25:22.180 --> 25:24.770
Since Clay seems incapable
of speaking at the moment

25:24.850 --> 25:25.850
I am Tara.

25:25.890 --> 25:28.190
Hey, I'm Samantha.

25:28.270 --> 25:30.110
Okay, let's have Amanda give you
a crash course

25:30.190 --> 25:31.520
on what to expect tonight.

25:31.610 --> 25:33.360
Taking drink orders, everything.

25:33.440 --> 25:35.650
- That would be great.
- Amanda?

25:35.740 --> 25:37.510
She's gonna help you out
for the first few hours,

25:37.530 --> 25:39.870
but after a certain point
we're gonna be slammed in.

25:39.950 --> 25:42.370
You're gonna have a section
all to yourself.

25:42.450 --> 25:44.540
Good thing I'm a quick learner.

26:00.640 --> 26:02.850
You just couldn't resist
helping out

26:02.930 --> 26:04.970
that damsel in distress,
could you?

26:05.060 --> 26:06.220
- Don't worry about it.
- Why?

26:06.310 --> 26:07.890
She's not gonna be here
very long.

26:07.980 --> 26:09.940
Why is that?

26:10.020 --> 26:12.120
Because she's never worked a day
in her life in a bar.

26:12.150 --> 26:14.320
She has no idea,
what she is in for.

26:14.400 --> 26:16.610
So you think tonight's
rowdy crowd is gonna scare her

26:16.690 --> 26:18.530
back to wherever the hell
she came from?

26:18.610 --> 26:20.450
That's the plan.

26:20.530 --> 26:23.330
Is there something going on
between you two?

26:23.410 --> 26:24.550
Because for a minute there
while you were

26:24.580 --> 26:26.540
staring at her like a deaf mute,

26:26.620 --> 26:28.770
it looked like you were going
to vault yourself over the bar

26:28.790 --> 26:31.750
and tackle her and do all sorts
of dirty things to her.

26:31.830 --> 26:33.540
Okay, you have quite an
imagination.

26:33.630 --> 26:37.250
- Just be careful, Clay.
- I... Nothing is going on.

26:37.340 --> 26:38.980
Okay, you know what?
This conversation is over.

26:39.010 --> 26:40.280
I'm gonna go see
if Hank needs any help

26:40.300 --> 26:43.640
in the kitchen
before happy hour starts.

26:43.720 --> 26:45.810
- Stubborn ass.
- I heard that!

26:47.970 --> 26:50.270
Hey, Hank, Elijah.
You guys good back here?

26:50.350 --> 26:52.810
- Oh, yeah.
- We're good, boss.

26:52.900 --> 26:54.230
Elijah, grab that for me.

26:54.310 --> 26:55.310
Good.

27:00.860 --> 27:02.210
They're gonna try to get
under your skin.

27:02.240 --> 27:03.870
- You can't let them. Okay?
- Okay.

27:03.950 --> 27:06.030
'Cause that's what they're
trying to do.

27:16.040 --> 27:17.590
Hi. Okay.

27:17.670 --> 27:19.760
It's on me. Enjoy.

27:23.930 --> 27:27.100
And here is your beer.
Oh, thank...

27:27.180 --> 27:29.270
Thanks.

27:31.430 --> 27:35.230
Jesus, Clay. That scowl's
gonna scare away customers.

27:37.400 --> 27:39.440
Or maybe that's your intention.

27:39.530 --> 27:41.330
To intimidate the hell
outta every guy in here

27:41.400 --> 27:42.920
so they don't touch
your shiny new toy?

27:42.990 --> 27:46.200
She's not my shiny new anything.

27:46.280 --> 27:47.530
What are you doing here anyway?

27:47.620 --> 27:48.800
You never come in
for ladies night.

27:48.830 --> 27:51.410
I'm providing moral support.

27:51.500 --> 27:52.960
For Samantha?

27:53.040 --> 27:54.060
Yeah,
I thought it'd be nice for her

27:54.080 --> 27:56.420
to see a familiar face tonight.

27:56.500 --> 28:00.050
I, I take it
you guys, uh, hit it off today?

28:00.130 --> 28:02.260
She's actually really nice.

28:02.340 --> 28:03.470
For a rich girl.

28:03.550 --> 28:04.550
And you know she's rich

28:04.590 --> 28:06.300
based on what exactly?

28:06.390 --> 28:07.640
Well, when I picked her up,

28:07.720 --> 28:11.140
she was carrying a $3000
Louis Vuitton purse.

28:11.220 --> 28:14.440
Hey, can I get two shots
of whisky and a...

28:14.520 --> 28:16.810
- Thanks.
- You got it.

28:16.900 --> 28:19.570
- Clay.
- Tessa. Everything okay?

28:19.650 --> 28:21.320
Your brother
is in the women's restroom

28:21.400 --> 28:23.420
banging some chick when I really
need to pee right now.

28:23.450 --> 28:25.030
- Mason.
- Uh, who else?

28:25.110 --> 28:27.910
You obviously think that Levi
would do anything so indecent?

28:27.990 --> 28:30.010
Look, since he's not talking
to me, can you please just go

28:30.030 --> 28:31.430
over there and take care
of the problem?

28:31.450 --> 28:34.000
- Yes.
- Please.

28:34.080 --> 28:37.460
Well, it's about dam time,
Romeo.

28:37.540 --> 28:39.440
What the fuck were you doing
in the women's restroom?

28:39.460 --> 28:41.340
It's called getting laid.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.020
You should try it some time,
big brother.

28:43.090 --> 28:45.260
Might improve your testy mood.
Mellow you out some.

28:45.340 --> 28:46.430
My mood is fine.

28:46.510 --> 28:47.510
I don't appreciate you

28:47.550 --> 28:49.220
being so crass in my bar.

28:49.300 --> 28:50.560
If you were anybody else,

28:50.640 --> 28:52.930
I'd have you thrown out
on your ass.

28:53.020 --> 28:54.430
Luckily I'm in good
with the owner.

28:54.520 --> 28:56.230
Jesus, Mason, can you keep it
in your pants

28:56.310 --> 28:57.520
for just one night?

28:57.610 --> 28:59.150
Why would I do that, kitty-kat?

28:59.230 --> 29:00.750
I don't know, so you don't catch
something,

29:00.770 --> 29:02.270
and your dick falls off.

29:02.360 --> 29:04.400
Not gonna happen, condoms first.

29:04.490 --> 29:07.780
- Always.
- You're gross. And disgusting.

29:07.870 --> 29:11.240
So you've told me
many times before.

29:11.330 --> 29:13.330
But you're my very best friend.

29:13.410 --> 29:15.410
And I know deep down inside,
you secretly love me

29:15.500 --> 29:18.710
despite all my faults.

29:18.790 --> 29:21.460
Hey, I'm so sorry.

29:21.550 --> 29:23.800
I punched in the wrong order
again.

29:23.880 --> 29:26.090
I mean, who knew there were
so many Collinses?

29:26.170 --> 29:29.010
This guy wanted a John Collins.

29:29.090 --> 29:30.970
Okay, so I know
this is fourth time

29:31.050 --> 29:32.600
I have messed up
my cocktail orders

29:32.680 --> 29:34.270
and I'm wasting your profits

29:34.350 --> 29:36.200
because you can't re-serve
the drinks, so just...

29:36.230 --> 29:38.100
Take the costs out
of my pay check.

29:38.190 --> 29:40.540
It's alright, cupcake. It's all
a part of the learning curve.

29:40.560 --> 29:42.230
Cupcake? Is that your name?

29:42.310 --> 29:44.530
Because you look
damn sweet to me.

29:44.610 --> 29:46.110
No. My name is Samantha.

29:46.190 --> 29:47.700
That's a nick name Clay gave me

29:47.780 --> 29:50.280
because I'm a lightweight
when I'm drinking.

29:50.370 --> 29:51.740
Did he now?

29:51.830 --> 29:53.450
Samantha, this is Mason.
He's...

29:53.540 --> 29:56.370
He's a man whore.

29:56.450 --> 29:59.000
Ooh, careful, kitty-kat. You're
starting to sound jealous.

29:59.080 --> 30:00.730
I'm not jealous. I'm just
telling Samantha how it is

30:00.750 --> 30:02.090
to keep her distance.

30:02.170 --> 30:05.090
Because you, Mason Kincaid,
are a slut.

30:05.170 --> 30:06.670
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

30:06.760 --> 30:10.260
It was nice to meet you, Mason.

30:10.340 --> 30:11.910
So you need help breaking in
the new bar waitress?

30:11.930 --> 30:13.680
Dude, don't be an asshole!

30:13.760 --> 30:17.270
She's off limits.
She's staying with Clay.

30:17.350 --> 30:18.850
Get the fuck out.

30:18.940 --> 30:20.730
Are you serious?

30:20.810 --> 30:21.960
Did you take in another stray

30:21.980 --> 30:23.820
and decide to keep her,
Saint Clay?

30:23.900 --> 30:25.650
It's only temporary
until she can figure out

30:25.730 --> 30:27.360
someplace on her own, okay?

30:27.440 --> 30:30.110
And before you ask, no,
we are not sleeping together.

30:30.200 --> 30:32.280
Too bad for you.

30:33.030 --> 30:35.120
Hm.

30:36.910 --> 30:38.750
I'll see you later, kitty-kat.

30:38.830 --> 30:40.460
Oh, I might be in late
tomorrow morning

30:40.540 --> 30:42.630
depending on how my night ends.

30:44.880 --> 30:47.210
And that is why I don't
come in on ladies' night.

30:47.300 --> 30:49.420
♪ And the feeling's right ♪

30:49.510 --> 30:51.090
Hey, baby, what's up?

30:51.180 --> 30:53.260
Oh, my God, you're looking good.

30:55.600 --> 30:57.270
I'm gonna get you a new drink.

30:57.350 --> 30:59.430
That would be great..

31:12.820 --> 31:15.160
- Thanks so much for helping me.
- No problem.

31:15.240 --> 31:17.330
You're doing great.

31:20.500 --> 31:22.580
See you, Elijah.

31:26.840 --> 31:28.920
Oh, bye, Amanda.

31:40.850 --> 31:43.230
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:43.310 --> 31:44.940
You doin' alright?

31:45.020 --> 31:46.860
No.

31:46.940 --> 31:50.230
I feel like I'm hung over
and I didn't even drink tonight.

31:50.320 --> 31:52.780
And my feet are killing me,

31:52.860 --> 31:55.660
and I am starving.

31:55.740 --> 31:57.450
Did you have lunch
before coming to work?

31:57.530 --> 32:00.040
I had a burger at a fast-food
place with Katrina.

32:00.120 --> 32:01.770
You should have taken
a break and ordered something

32:01.790 --> 32:03.930
from the kitchen, everybody eats
for free during their shift.

32:03.960 --> 32:06.960
I think I'm just gonna lay
my head right down here

32:07.040 --> 32:08.380
and go to sleep.

32:08.460 --> 32:10.550
Hang on a second,
I'll be right back.

32:17.550 --> 32:19.260
Tan-ta-na-na!

32:19.350 --> 32:22.060
Thank you.
I will eat in a second.

32:22.140 --> 32:26.400
I am just finishing
counting out my tips.

32:26.480 --> 32:30.400
I had no idea how much money
you can make tip wise

32:30.480 --> 32:31.940
because I've never done this.

32:32.030 --> 32:35.660
This is way more
than I anticipated.

32:35.740 --> 32:36.820
Okay.

32:36.910 --> 32:40.200
So, this is for the clothing

32:40.290 --> 32:42.580
and the toiletries
I bought today.

32:42.660 --> 32:45.410
And I'm hanging on
to a little bit for incidentals

32:45.500 --> 32:47.920
but if I make this much
every night,

32:48.000 --> 32:50.340
I should have paid you back
in no time

32:50.420 --> 32:52.880
and then I can start
looking for my own place

32:52.970 --> 32:55.380
and I'll be out of your way.

32:55.470 --> 32:57.550
You did well tonight.

32:57.640 --> 32:58.800
You sound surprised.

32:58.890 --> 33:00.640
Well, maybe I am.

33:00.720 --> 33:02.330
You pick these up pretty quick
for not having any experience...

33:02.350 --> 33:04.060
I will have you know
that I graduated.

33:04.140 --> 33:06.650
Summa Cum Laude
from Northwestern University

33:06.730 --> 33:08.400
with a degree
in political science.

33:08.480 --> 33:12.690
Wow, what do you use a big fancy
degree like that for?

33:14.610 --> 33:17.280
I don't.

33:17.360 --> 33:19.410
I was thinking about
going to law school

33:19.490 --> 33:21.910
but my parents nixed that idea.

33:21.990 --> 33:23.330
You wanted to go to law school?

33:23.410 --> 33:26.080
Well, I, I wanted to do
something for me

33:26.160 --> 33:28.290
and that wasn't allowed.

33:28.370 --> 33:30.920
After all, why do you need
a law degree

33:31.000 --> 33:33.050
if you're just
expected to get married

33:33.130 --> 33:36.130
and be some man's arm candy,
stay at home,

33:36.220 --> 33:38.010
and make babies?

33:38.090 --> 33:40.890
So-so you don't want to get
married and have babies?

33:40.970 --> 33:42.600
Yeah, of course I do.

33:42.680 --> 33:45.730
I just want to do that
with a man I'm in love with

33:45.810 --> 33:48.350
and not someone
who's been handpicked for me.

33:48.440 --> 33:52.400
I want, I need more for my life.

33:52.480 --> 33:54.290
Alright, I get your need
to be self-sufficient,

33:54.320 --> 33:58.030
but... you don't want to be a
waitress the rest of your life.

33:58.110 --> 34:02.120
But you have to admit it's kind
of an interesting start

34:02.200 --> 34:03.870
to whatever is to come.

34:03.950 --> 34:08.290
Okay, if you could do anything,
be anything in the world...

34:08.370 --> 34:10.330
what would it be?

34:10.420 --> 34:14.050
I would be a pastry chef.

34:14.130 --> 34:15.550
Really?

34:15.630 --> 34:17.090
Okay, when I was growing up,

34:17.170 --> 34:19.010
I used to sneak into the kitchen

34:19.090 --> 34:22.180
and hang out with our,
with our housekeeper Maggie

34:22.260 --> 34:25.770
when she was making desserts,
she taught me to bake...

34:25.850 --> 34:29.890
cakes and pastries
and pies and I,

34:29.980 --> 34:32.570
I loved every second of it.

34:32.650 --> 34:35.070
I actually went to culinary
school two years ago

34:35.150 --> 34:38.490
and I was certified
as a pastry chef

34:38.570 --> 34:42.990
but my, my parents didn't take
that seriously either.

34:43.070 --> 34:45.160
But you did go.

34:47.580 --> 34:50.210
If it makes you happy,
you should do it.

34:50.290 --> 34:52.920
Well, I've seriously
thought about it

34:53.000 --> 34:58.760
and I just think
with no real job experience as,

34:58.840 --> 35:02.220
as a pastry chef or anything,
for that matter,

35:02.300 --> 35:05.600
I don't think
that a one-star restaurant

35:05.680 --> 35:07.270
would consider hiring me

35:07.350 --> 35:12.310
let alone a five-star
establishment.

35:12.390 --> 35:14.770
Well, you won't know
unless you try it, right?

35:14.860 --> 35:16.940
Yeah.

35:20.610 --> 35:24.570
So, what about you?
How did you end up owning a bar?

35:26.410 --> 35:30.830
Um, well, Jerry was the guy
that owned the bar

35:30.910 --> 35:34.080
and he hired me when I was 16.

35:34.170 --> 35:36.670
God, I needed a job so bad.

35:36.750 --> 35:39.800
He started me out sweepin'
floors, takin' out the trash,

35:39.880 --> 35:41.970
you know, just general clean up.

35:42.050 --> 35:44.340
Worked my ass off,
and the harder I worked

35:44.430 --> 35:47.680
the more he taught me
about the business.

35:47.770 --> 35:50.600
He was like
this father figure to me,

35:50.680 --> 35:52.890
since I didn't really have one.

35:52.980 --> 35:57.820
When I turned 21,
he put me behind the bar.

35:57.900 --> 35:59.990
Taught me everything I know.

36:01.190 --> 36:03.660
Just kind, caring, selfless.

36:05.700 --> 36:07.790
Oh, he was the best.

36:10.500 --> 36:12.910
You said was.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.630
Yeah, uh, he had a heart attack
and passed away

36:15.710 --> 36:18.290
when I was 24,
that's actually how I found out

36:18.380 --> 36:19.960
that I owned the bar.

36:20.050 --> 36:24.760
He didn't have a wife,
a family. No kids.

36:24.840 --> 36:27.010
You know, Katrina was right,

36:27.090 --> 36:29.430
you are nothing
like your brother Mason.

36:32.270 --> 36:33.810
Thank God I'm not like Mason.

36:33.890 --> 36:37.150
What, what exactly did Katrina
tell you about me?

36:37.230 --> 36:39.860
She said that you are
the responsible one.

36:39.940 --> 36:41.320
Mm.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.490
Yeah.

36:44.860 --> 36:46.050
Why do people call you "Saint?"

36:48.580 --> 36:50.990
Uh, well, the nickname actually
comes from Mason,

36:51.080 --> 36:53.660
believe it or not. He calls me
saint 'cause I have a tendency

36:53.750 --> 36:56.710
to help other people.

36:59.960 --> 37:03.880
Like, Hank, and Elijah, and me.

37:04.930 --> 37:07.010
Yeah.

37:07.090 --> 37:10.310
I didn't have the, uh...

37:10.390 --> 37:13.430
the best life before Jerry.

37:13.520 --> 37:17.150
And now I'm fortunate enough
to be in a position

37:17.230 --> 37:20.020
where I can help
a lot of people.

37:20.110 --> 37:23.490
Even if it's something as simple
as giving them a job.

37:25.700 --> 37:28.570
I love how you see
the good in people.

37:28.660 --> 37:30.870
Well, it wasn't always that way.

37:35.160 --> 37:39.250
Your life is so opposite
of how I grew up.

37:39.330 --> 37:44.550
I had everything handed to me
and I took it for granted.

37:44.630 --> 37:47.050
And I just...

37:47.130 --> 37:49.590
I just...

37:49.680 --> 37:54.140
In that world,
everything was so superficial

37:54.220 --> 37:57.390
and I just felt so suffocated

37:57.480 --> 38:01.110
and every time that I tried
to better myself

38:01.190 --> 38:05.110
or make a difference, I was
reminded that I'm a Jameson

38:05.190 --> 38:09.530
and there are expectations
I have to live up to,

38:09.610 --> 38:12.280
and what I want doesn't matter.

38:14.120 --> 38:17.540
Well, look at you now,
all stubborn and rebellious.

38:20.080 --> 38:22.630
Yeah. Yeah, I...

38:22.710 --> 38:26.210
I like how it feels.

38:26.300 --> 38:28.510
I kinda like being a bad girl.

38:31.760 --> 38:33.850
It feels...

38:34.220 --> 38:37.770
It feels quite liberating.

38:56.620 --> 38:58.710
Touch me, Clay.

39:03.590 --> 39:06.340
Samantha, I already
warned you this morning.

39:06.420 --> 39:08.920
What, that you're not
a gentleman?

39:10.550 --> 39:12.720
That you don't like it...

39:12.800 --> 39:17.470
sweet or soft and gentle.

39:17.560 --> 39:19.100
No.

39:19.180 --> 39:20.980
Well, I don't need
a warning, Clay.

39:21.060 --> 39:25.900
I, I thought about it all day
what you said to me

39:25.980 --> 39:28.530
and about what
you wanna do to me,

39:28.610 --> 39:31.700
and I asked myself
if that's what I want too.

39:31.780 --> 39:34.030
You have no idea what you want.

39:34.120 --> 39:35.410
That's where you're wrong.

39:35.490 --> 39:39.000
I know exactly what I want

39:39.080 --> 39:43.130
and I, I want you...

39:43.210 --> 39:46.210
more than I've ever wanted
another man.

39:48.960 --> 39:53.010
I am trying really,
really hard...

39:53.090 --> 39:56.720
not to take advantage
of what you're offering.

39:56.810 --> 39:58.890
And that kiss this morning...

40:01.730 --> 40:05.310
just thinking about it
makes me...

40:05.400 --> 40:06.980
Wet.

40:07.070 --> 40:09.990
Well, that's definitely
one of the things,

40:10.070 --> 40:12.530
but it makes me think
about everything

40:12.610 --> 40:14.700
that I want.

40:15.570 --> 40:17.620
Your mouth on me

40:17.700 --> 40:20.540
and your tongue
giving me pleasure

40:20.620 --> 40:22.790
and what it would feel like

40:22.870 --> 40:27.500
for you to slip deep,
deep inside of me.

40:29.510 --> 40:32.550
I don't want to be
a good girl anymore, Clay.

40:32.630 --> 40:35.390
I want to be very,

40:35.470 --> 40:39.430
very bad with you, Saint Clay.

40:39.510 --> 40:41.930
I'm not a saint, cupcake.

40:42.020 --> 40:44.020
Especially when it comes
to fucking.

40:44.100 --> 40:47.270
Well, that's a good thing
because I don't want a saint,

40:47.350 --> 40:49.440
I want a sinner.

41:17.680 --> 41:19.760
Saman-Samantha...

41:23.100 --> 41:25.310
It's getting late.

41:25.390 --> 41:27.270
It's late.

41:27.350 --> 41:29.440
Yeah, it's late.

41:32.030 --> 41:35.610
And I'm gonna go take
a long, hot shower.

41:37.110 --> 41:39.120
Are you coming?

41:39.200 --> 41:42.490
No. Not for a while.

41:42.580 --> 41:46.710
You're afraid I'm gonna have
my wicked way with you?

41:46.790 --> 41:48.880
Not at all.

41:49.460 --> 41:51.550
Okay then.

41:52.920 --> 41:55.260
- Goodnight, Saint.
- Goodnight, cupcake.

42:32.090 --> 42:33.340
Goodnight, guys.
Good to see ya.

42:33.420 --> 42:35.010
- Goodnight, Clay.
- Thanks a lot.

42:35.090 --> 42:37.260
Hey.

42:37.340 --> 42:40.890
I'm going upstairs.
Are you coming?

42:40.970 --> 42:44.060
Uh, I'm gonna s... Um...

42:44.140 --> 42:47.930
I'm gonna stay down here
and get some work done.

42:48.020 --> 42:50.440
Okay.

42:50.520 --> 42:52.610
Goodnight.

44:02.010 --> 44:03.650
Put the ketchup in the walk-in
when you're finished, okay?

44:03.680 --> 44:05.800
- Okay.
- Thank you.

44:10.100 --> 44:13.100
Clay, can I get some help
with the keg?

44:13.190 --> 44:15.270
Yeah, one second.

44:37.590 --> 44:39.550
"Hi, mom,
I know you must be worried

44:39.630 --> 44:41.340
"but please know I'm fine.

44:41.420 --> 44:44.380
"I found a job and I'm earning
money, it feels really good

44:44.470 --> 44:46.680
"to be taking care of myself
for a change.

44:46.760 --> 44:50.100
I hope to see you soon.
I love you, Samantha."

44:53.690 --> 44:55.770
You need any help with that?

45:00.650 --> 45:05.700
How long do you intend
to avoid being alone with me?

45:05.780 --> 45:08.030
It's for your own good.

45:08.120 --> 45:12.040
Why does everyone think
they know what's best for me?

45:12.120 --> 45:14.460
When does what I want matter?

45:14.540 --> 45:16.080
Samantha, I'm not going to...

45:16.170 --> 45:18.420
Please don't say no.

45:18.500 --> 45:22.760
I'm a grown woman, Clay,
and I want you.

45:22.840 --> 45:26.720
And I know that
you feel the same.

45:26.800 --> 45:30.260
You're eating me up
with your dark eyes.

45:30.350 --> 45:33.890
And even though you haven't
touched me, I'm getting wet

45:33.980 --> 45:38.730
just thinking about all
the things you wanna do to me

45:38.810 --> 45:41.020
and all of the things
I wanna do to you.

45:48.990 --> 45:51.370
Take off your shirt
so I can touch you.

46:05.090 --> 46:09.050
You touch all you want...

46:09.140 --> 46:11.970
but when you're done, I'm
in charge, do you understand?

46:29.360 --> 46:32.370
You're so hot and hard.

46:36.200 --> 46:37.330
And soft.

48:05.090 --> 48:07.170
Stand up.

49:00.310 --> 49:02.390
Take off your top.

49:09.980 --> 49:12.070
Hm.

49:18.240 --> 49:20.330
Leave it.

50:07.750 --> 50:09.830
I want more.

50:12.250 --> 50:14.340
On the desk...

50:14.710 --> 50:16.800
unless you change your mind.

50:20.850 --> 50:22.930
Mmm.

50:58.300 --> 51:00.390
Oh, yes.

51:01.390 --> 51:03.470
Thank you, Mason.

51:06.020 --> 51:08.100
Come here.

51:13.190 --> 51:14.980
Do you still want this?

51:15.070 --> 51:17.400
Yes, I want this.

52:20.670 --> 52:23.510
Hey, can I get you
another drink?

52:29.270 --> 52:31.100
- Cupcake.
- Oh, hey!

52:31.180 --> 52:33.020
- How you doin'?
- I'm okay, I'm good.

52:33.100 --> 52:35.650
- Look at you, so professional.
- Yeah. Thanks.

52:37.940 --> 52:40.190
What's up, Levi?
Did you talk to Mason?

52:40.280 --> 52:41.990
Not personally.

52:42.070 --> 52:43.410
Though he did text me to tell me

52:43.490 --> 52:45.280
you have a woman
living with you.

52:45.370 --> 52:46.490
You think big news like that

52:46.570 --> 52:47.720
would come directly
from you instead.

52:47.740 --> 52:48.950
She's not living with me

52:49.040 --> 52:50.370
in the way that you mean.

52:50.450 --> 52:51.850
It doesn't matter
why she's living with you

52:51.870 --> 52:53.560
the fact that you let a woman
stay in your place

52:53.580 --> 52:57.960
for more than one night is quite
uh, shocking and fascinating...

52:58.050 --> 52:59.610
Okay, she didn't have anywhere
else to go,

52:59.630 --> 53:01.190
I'm just helping her
get back on her feet.

53:01.210 --> 53:03.680
Oh, it's very charitable of you.

53:03.760 --> 53:06.680
Hey, can I get two shots of
whiskey and a couple of beers...

53:06.760 --> 53:08.600
I take it she's the gorgeous
blonde over there?

53:08.680 --> 53:10.640
Yeah, that's her. Samantha.

53:10.720 --> 53:12.390
Also known as cupcake.

53:12.480 --> 53:14.310
Fuck Mason and his big mouth.

53:14.390 --> 53:16.650
Did you really expect anything
less from Mason?

53:16.730 --> 53:19.020
Hey, handsome,
what can I do for you?

53:19.110 --> 53:21.610
Uh, Samantha, this is my other
brother Levi.

53:21.690 --> 53:23.400
He's a cop with the Chicago PD.

53:23.490 --> 53:26.570
- Hi, it's so nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

53:26.660 --> 53:29.700
So you,
you're the respectable brother?

53:31.450 --> 53:33.870
- Excuse me?
- Katrina.

53:33.960 --> 53:36.630
Ah, yes, I suppose
I am the respectable one,

53:36.710 --> 53:38.330
at least compared to Mason.

53:38.420 --> 53:39.650
That's an understatement,
there's a reason why

53:39.670 --> 53:41.170
Katrina calls him a man whore.

53:41.250 --> 53:44.590
I just think Mason hasn't found
the right woman yet.

53:44.670 --> 53:46.800
That is an optimistic thought,
even for Mason.

53:46.890 --> 53:49.100
The man's got a point.

53:49.180 --> 53:52.390
I have to go back to work.
I'm sure I'll see you around.

53:56.480 --> 54:00.020
This one's different...
isn't she?

54:00.110 --> 54:04.490
Whatever may or may not be
going on is just casual.

54:04.570 --> 54:06.760
And only until she can figure
out what she's doing next.

54:06.780 --> 54:08.110
Mm-hm.

54:08.200 --> 54:11.080
What?
Spit it out!

54:11.160 --> 54:12.600
- You're an idiot.
- You're an idiot.

54:12.620 --> 54:13.620
I know what I'm doing.

54:13.660 --> 54:15.750
You don't know shit.

54:17.120 --> 54:19.170
I saw the way she looked at you.

54:19.250 --> 54:22.670
But more importantly, I noticed
the way you looked at her.

54:22.750 --> 54:25.260
Like you'd vault over this bar
if any guy in this place

54:25.340 --> 54:27.510
so much as laid a hand on her.

54:27.590 --> 54:30.090
Never seen such a possessive
look in your eyes,

54:30.180 --> 54:32.770
that's how I know
she's different.

54:32.850 --> 54:34.930
I barely know her.

54:38.600 --> 54:41.400
Our mother didn't give us
a reason to trust women.

54:41.480 --> 54:44.610
She didn't give a shit about us,
and Wyatt was even worse,

54:44.690 --> 54:46.770
the bastard had no qualms
beating the crap out of us.

54:46.820 --> 54:47.820
Shut up.

54:47.860 --> 54:48.880
How long are you gonna let

54:48.910 --> 54:49.050
what they did to us

54:50.030 --> 54:51.700
dictate your future
and happiness?

54:51.780 --> 54:54.870
No one's perfect, hell,
everyone's got a past.

54:54.950 --> 54:56.590
But no matter what you think
or feel about

54:56.620 --> 55:00.210
what Wyatt did to you...

55:00.290 --> 55:01.830
you're a good person, Clay.

55:01.920 --> 55:03.840
Stop stirring shit up.

55:03.920 --> 55:06.130
If you just talk about it
instead of pretending

55:06.210 --> 55:08.130
like it never happened,
maybe you'd quit hiding

55:08.220 --> 55:10.340
behind this bar
and maybe you wouldn't let this

55:10.430 --> 55:11.970
one worthwhile woman get away.

55:12.050 --> 55:14.010
Let it fucking go, dude.

55:14.100 --> 55:15.350
I don't need a lecture.

55:15.430 --> 55:17.100
And all that stuff
has nothing to do

55:17.180 --> 55:18.910
with any kind of relationship
that I have with Samantha.

55:18.940 --> 55:20.600
No.

55:20.690 --> 55:22.040
It's holding you back
from having any kind

55:22.060 --> 55:24.650
of relationship at all.

55:24.730 --> 55:28.280
You don't always have to be
so strong for everyone, Clay.

55:28.360 --> 55:30.010
And you don't have to
carry the burden alone.

55:30.030 --> 55:33.830
If you remember,
I was there too.

55:33.910 --> 55:36.120
I fucking remember everything.

55:36.200 --> 55:39.250
Now, if you're done analyzing
me, you can see your way out.

55:39.330 --> 55:40.710
I have a lot of work to do.

55:40.790 --> 55:43.250
Of course you do.
Have a good night, Clay.

55:43.330 --> 55:45.920
Fuck you for screwing up
my night, asshole.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.090
You're welcome.

55:52.800 --> 55:55.100
Hey. You okay?

55:55.180 --> 55:57.270
I'm fine.

56:15.030 --> 56:16.870
- Hey.
- Hey, what are you doing here?

56:16.950 --> 56:18.620
I have a delivery for you.

56:18.700 --> 56:19.870
I didn't order anything.

56:19.950 --> 56:21.290
You didn't, but Clay did.

56:21.370 --> 56:22.810
Or rather Clay told me
what he wanted

56:22.870 --> 56:23.950
and I did all the ordering.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.020
There's no way he could have

56:25.040 --> 56:26.130
pulled this off without me.

56:26.210 --> 56:27.880
Bring it in, boys.

56:27.960 --> 56:30.970
I didn't know
what exactly you needed

56:31.050 --> 56:32.720
so I told the consultant
at the store

56:32.800 --> 56:34.820
to put together everything
a new pastry chef would need.

56:34.850 --> 56:37.310
Oh, my God.

56:37.390 --> 56:39.240
So you should be well-equipped,
I pretty much cleared out

56:39.270 --> 56:40.850
the bacon aisle
at the grocery store.

56:40.930 --> 56:44.440
This is too much, he must have
spent a small fortune.

56:44.520 --> 56:45.710
Clay didn't hesitate
when I told him

56:45.730 --> 56:46.980
how much everything was.

56:47.070 --> 56:48.570
Well, I have to go
say thank you.

56:48.650 --> 56:50.750
Tell you what, how about you
start unpacking everything

56:50.780 --> 56:52.780
see what's inside
and I'll go get Clay.

56:52.860 --> 56:54.110
Okay.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.830
She liked everything?

57:06.920 --> 57:08.600
Are you kidding me?
She loved it.

57:08.670 --> 57:10.920
I don't think I've ever seen
a woman so thrilled

57:11.010 --> 57:13.430
to get kitchen appliances
as a gift from a man.

57:16.090 --> 57:18.510
Well, that was fun.

57:18.600 --> 57:20.600
- Thank you again for everything.
- Yeah.

57:20.680 --> 57:21.950
Couldn't have done it
without you.

57:21.970 --> 57:24.020
It's my pleasure,
anyway, I gotta run,

57:24.100 --> 57:25.770
but Samantha's
waiting for you upstairs,

57:25.850 --> 57:28.150
so go and enjoy her excitement.

57:28.230 --> 57:31.280
- Okay.
- And for the record, I like her.

57:32.400 --> 57:35.070
- A lot.
- I do too.

57:35.150 --> 57:37.240
Bye.

57:54.880 --> 57:58.300
Does, uh, everything
meet with your approval?

57:58.390 --> 58:01.310
I can't believe you did
all of this for me.

58:01.390 --> 58:04.180
Well, you want to be a pastry
chef, you gotta be able to bake,

58:04.270 --> 58:06.810
I just supplied the means
to make that happen.

58:11.020 --> 58:13.740
Thank you so much, Clay.

58:13.820 --> 58:17.530
You have no idea
what this means to me.

58:17.610 --> 58:20.070
I will pay you back
for everything,

58:20.160 --> 58:21.990
every single cent, I promise.

58:22.080 --> 58:23.720
It's a gift, cupcake,
you don't have to pay

58:23.750 --> 58:25.080
something back that's a gift.

58:25.160 --> 58:26.790
I can.

58:26.870 --> 58:29.460
Okay, well, I'll tell you what,
how about you repay me

58:29.540 --> 58:32.210
by making me
your favorite dessert?

58:32.290 --> 58:35.630
Well, my favorite dessert isn't
anything extravagant

58:35.720 --> 58:37.680
but if you want
I can make you something fancier

58:37.760 --> 58:40.930
like a chocolate profiterole
or an eclair.

58:41.010 --> 58:43.350
Do I look like somebody
who eats chocolate

58:43.430 --> 58:46.730
whatever-they're-called
and fancy eclairs?

58:46.810 --> 58:49.690
I want your favorite dessert.

58:49.770 --> 58:53.780
Okay. Will you, will you stay
and keep me company?

58:53.860 --> 58:55.940
Sure.

1:00:47.770 --> 1:00:50.480
It, it's a cupcake.

1:00:52.060 --> 1:00:54.190
Not just any cupcake,

1:00:54.270 --> 1:00:59.490
this is a lemon cupcake
with a cream curd inside

1:00:59.570 --> 1:01:01.150
and a melt in your mouth

1:01:01.240 --> 1:01:04.160
buttercream frosting
whipped on top.

1:01:04.240 --> 1:01:08.870
I guarantee it is the best thing
you'll ever put in your mouth.

1:01:08.950 --> 1:01:11.160
Well, maybe the second,
third or fourth best thing,

1:01:11.250 --> 1:01:14.040
but definitely
not the best thing.

1:01:14.120 --> 1:01:15.420
You're so bad.

1:01:15.500 --> 1:01:16.750
Oh, I can be even badder.

1:01:16.830 --> 1:01:18.400
You want me to go on
about those other things

1:01:18.420 --> 1:01:20.380
that are sweeter than candy?

1:01:20.460 --> 1:01:22.880
No, I want you
to eat my cupcake.

1:01:22.970 --> 1:01:24.590
Mm.

1:01:24.680 --> 1:01:26.760
Oh, I've already had a taste
of the best cupcake

1:01:26.850 --> 1:01:29.220
I'm ever gonna have.

1:01:29.310 --> 1:01:32.980
But if sit on my lap
maybe I'll try this lemon one.

1:01:33.060 --> 1:01:35.150
- Thank you for indulging me.
- Mm-hm.

1:01:35.230 --> 1:01:37.400
Better give me a bite quicker
before I change my mind

1:01:37.480 --> 1:01:39.570
and eat you instead.

1:01:53.290 --> 1:01:55.370
Hm.

1:01:55.920 --> 1:01:57.710
Hm.

1:01:57.790 --> 1:01:59.670
When I was a kid...

1:01:59.750 --> 1:02:01.840
When you were a kid, what?

1:02:04.050 --> 1:02:06.010
- Never mind. It's nothing.
- No, no. What?

1:02:06.090 --> 1:02:07.850
It's obviously something.

1:02:07.930 --> 1:02:09.640
Were you not allowed
to have cupcakes?

1:02:11.430 --> 1:02:15.640
When I was a kid I didn't know
what cupcakes were.

1:02:15.730 --> 1:02:19.150
How is that even possible?

1:02:19.230 --> 1:02:23.490
I mean, my brothers and I never
really had a birthday party.

1:02:23.570 --> 1:02:25.860
The school we went to
didn't allow outside food,

1:02:25.940 --> 1:02:28.370
not even on special occasions.

1:02:28.450 --> 1:02:30.740
We didn't have a TV.

1:02:30.830 --> 1:02:35.960
And all the groceries we got
were from a local food bank.

1:02:36.040 --> 1:02:38.330
First time I saw a cupcake,

1:02:38.420 --> 1:02:39.670
I was walking home from school,

1:02:39.750 --> 1:02:41.960
I was like seven years old

1:02:42.050 --> 1:02:46.050
and I passed by this
upscale bakery.

1:02:46.130 --> 1:02:48.090
I looked in the window and...

1:02:50.390 --> 1:02:52.810
I could not stop
staring at them.

1:02:54.930 --> 1:02:57.020
I was so hungry.

1:02:59.190 --> 1:03:00.670
And that's when the woman inside
came out

1:03:00.690 --> 1:03:03.610
and chased me away.

1:03:03.690 --> 1:03:06.150
Why would she do that
to a little boy?

1:03:06.240 --> 1:03:08.150
You know, people in town saw me

1:03:08.240 --> 1:03:11.950
as this lowlife Kincaid,

1:03:13.580 --> 1:03:17.210
this bastard child of a...

1:03:17.290 --> 1:03:19.290
a crack whore.

1:03:19.370 --> 1:03:22.090
And having a poor, dirty
little kid outside your store

1:03:22.170 --> 1:03:24.250
isn't very good for business.

1:03:25.340 --> 1:03:27.300
I'm so sorry.

1:03:27.380 --> 1:03:30.430
That's a long time ago.

1:03:30.510 --> 1:03:34.680
Well, I'll make you all
the cupcakes that you like...

1:03:36.970 --> 1:03:40.100
whenever you want.

1:03:40.190 --> 1:03:42.270
You're the only cupcake I need.

1:04:02.460 --> 1:04:06.710
I do think you need
a little frosting.

1:04:39.200 --> 1:04:41.500
Fuck! I forgot a condom.

1:04:42.710 --> 1:04:44.790
Actually...

1:04:46.550 --> 1:04:48.630
I like to be prepared.

1:04:55.600 --> 1:04:57.100
Oh, bye, Charlie.

1:04:57.180 --> 1:04:59.270
- Night.
- See you.

1:05:47.730 --> 1:05:51.400
Here is all the money I owe you.

1:05:51.490 --> 1:05:53.570
Thank you.

1:06:31.320 --> 1:06:32.440
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:07:20.240 --> 1:07:21.780
- Hey.
- Hi.

1:07:21.870 --> 1:07:23.950
- What are you doing?
- Just a little inventory.

1:07:24.040 --> 1:07:25.830
What do you have for me today?

1:07:25.910 --> 1:07:29.460
This is a caramel Fleur de Sel,
French...

1:07:29.540 --> 1:07:31.790
- Layman's terms, please.
- Okay.

1:07:31.880 --> 1:07:34.340
It is two sweet
meringue-based cookies

1:07:34.420 --> 1:07:36.970
with a whipped caramel cream
in the center.

1:07:37.050 --> 1:07:39.720
Mm, meringue-based, see,
using those big ones again.

1:07:39.800 --> 1:07:41.970
- Just try the damn thing.
- Okay.

1:07:43.600 --> 1:07:45.680
Mm.

1:07:47.930 --> 1:07:50.810
Every day
you make something new.

1:07:50.900 --> 1:07:52.520
And every day I swear
it's my favorite,

1:07:52.610 --> 1:07:57.190
but always those are like little
tastes of heaven in my mouth.

1:07:57.280 --> 1:07:59.360
Next to you, of course.

1:08:10.080 --> 1:08:11.540
I need to talk to you.

1:08:11.630 --> 1:08:13.330
Oh, talking's overrated.

1:08:13.420 --> 1:08:15.550
Wouldn't you rather us go
upstairs and...

1:08:15.630 --> 1:08:18.130
have me use my mouth
for other things.

1:08:18.210 --> 1:08:19.630
How about after?

1:08:19.720 --> 1:08:22.430
It's kind of something
that's important to me.

1:08:25.310 --> 1:08:27.810
Okay. Have a seat.

1:08:27.890 --> 1:08:30.770
First of all, thank you
for letting me borrow

1:08:30.850 --> 1:08:33.110
your laptop
for the past couple of days.

1:08:33.190 --> 1:08:35.250
Well, you're welcome, but that
can't be what's so important.

1:08:35.270 --> 1:08:37.190
No.

1:08:37.270 --> 1:08:40.650
And so I've been thinking
and considering

1:08:40.740 --> 1:08:42.280
all my options the past week,

1:08:42.360 --> 1:08:44.780
how do I move forward
as a pastry chef.

1:08:44.870 --> 1:08:48.750
How does someone
with no experience get a job.

1:08:48.830 --> 1:08:50.790
And what kind of environment
do I want to work in

1:08:50.870 --> 1:08:54.000
and I, I just realized that

1:08:54.080 --> 1:08:56.460
I don't want to work
in a restaurant.

1:08:56.550 --> 1:08:59.840
I want to work
in a French bakery.

1:08:59.920 --> 1:09:00.920
Hm.

1:09:01.010 --> 1:09:03.340
I can see you doing that.

1:09:03.430 --> 1:09:05.030
You know Mason came near
the break room the other day

1:09:05.050 --> 1:09:07.640
and he had one of those
French pastries you made

1:09:07.720 --> 1:09:12.770
with the vanilla custard
and the flaky whatever.

1:09:12.850 --> 1:09:17.110
And after eating it, he said
that he was going to marry you

1:09:17.190 --> 1:09:18.860
and keep you in the kitchen
and baking him

1:09:18.940 --> 1:09:20.940
pastries and pies all day.

1:09:21.030 --> 1:09:22.280
And what did you say to that?

1:09:22.360 --> 1:09:25.030
I told him
over my fucking dead body.

1:09:29.620 --> 1:09:34.790
So, I, I contacted this woman
that my mother used to hire

1:09:34.870 --> 1:09:37.380
to make pastries at different
events we had at the house

1:09:37.460 --> 1:09:39.550
and her name is Adeline.

1:09:39.630 --> 1:09:42.630
She owns a French bakery
and a catering business

1:09:42.720 --> 1:09:44.340
in downtown Chicago.

1:09:44.430 --> 1:09:48.100
So, I did my research
and I read all the reviews

1:09:48.180 --> 1:09:51.560
all of which are nearly
five stars.

1:09:51.640 --> 1:09:53.520
She has a phenomenal reputation.

1:09:53.600 --> 1:09:58.070
So, I worked up the nerve
and I, I gave her a call.

1:09:58.150 --> 1:10:01.440
I, I didn't know
you were looking for a job.

1:10:01.530 --> 1:10:02.710
Well, I didn't wanna
say anything

1:10:02.740 --> 1:10:05.740
until it was more concrete.

1:10:05.820 --> 1:10:07.740
Well, anyway, I gave her a call

1:10:07.830 --> 1:10:11.370
and she wants
to interview me next week

1:10:11.450 --> 1:10:13.540
for a position as a baker.

1:10:15.290 --> 1:10:18.000
It's great.
That's exactly what you want.

1:10:18.090 --> 1:10:20.290
Although I hate losing
such a good waitress.

1:10:23.210 --> 1:10:26.630
Well, there's something else
I need to talk to you about.

1:10:26.720 --> 1:10:30.430
I, I'm going to look
for my own place.

1:10:30.510 --> 1:10:32.350
I've taken advantage
of your generosity

1:10:32.430 --> 1:10:35.810
for longer than I should have
and you've been great

1:10:35.890 --> 1:10:40.650
but it's really past time.

1:10:40.730 --> 1:10:43.190
I mean, it's no trouble having
you stay upstairs.

1:10:43.280 --> 1:10:44.550
Are you, are you sure you're
in a position

1:10:44.570 --> 1:10:46.650
where you can afford
something like that?

1:10:46.740 --> 1:10:48.410
Actually, yeah.

1:10:48.490 --> 1:10:51.240
I pawned my necklace
and my watch

1:10:51.330 --> 1:10:53.750
and I should have more
than enough for rent

1:10:53.830 --> 1:11:00.000
and other necessities so long
as I budget carefully.

1:11:00.090 --> 1:11:04.010
Oh, you've been busy.

1:11:04.090 --> 1:11:06.840
Well, I have to think
about my future.

1:11:06.930 --> 1:11:09.010
I can't stay here forever.

1:11:16.480 --> 1:11:19.270
Um, that must be the beer
delivery, I'm expecting.

1:11:31.450 --> 1:11:34.750
Well, well, well.

1:11:34.830 --> 1:11:37.080
If it ain't Clay Kincaid.

1:11:37.160 --> 1:11:39.540
All grown up
with a bar his very own.

1:11:39.630 --> 1:11:42.040
Get the fuck out of here.

1:11:42.130 --> 1:11:43.880
That any way to greet
an old friend?

1:11:43.960 --> 1:11:46.210
Get the fuck out of my bar!

1:11:46.300 --> 1:11:47.550
Whoo, whoo.

1:11:47.630 --> 1:11:49.890
Oh.

1:11:49.970 --> 1:11:52.890
Not until we have a chat first.

1:11:52.970 --> 1:11:57.430
Oh, boy, ain't that a fine
little piece of ass

1:11:57.520 --> 1:11:59.600
you got over there.

1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:05.150
You always were a stupid
little fuck, weren't you?

1:12:05.230 --> 1:12:07.780
You come at me again
and I swear to God

1:12:07.860 --> 1:12:09.530
I'll fuckin' gut you

1:12:09.610 --> 1:12:14.240
like I should
all those years ago. Huh?

1:12:14.330 --> 1:12:19.410
And then I'll make your little
whore watch you bleed out.

1:12:19.500 --> 1:12:22.080
- Go upstairs, Samantha.
- Oh, don't worry, sweetheart.

1:12:22.170 --> 1:12:25.340
I-I ain't gonna stab lover boy

1:12:25.420 --> 1:12:27.250
unless he gives me a reason to.

1:12:35.350 --> 1:12:37.060
Hey, uh, Katrina,
you need to send

1:12:37.140 --> 1:12:38.460
Mason over to the bar
immediately.

1:12:38.520 --> 1:12:39.700
There's a man here
that's threatening

1:12:39.730 --> 1:12:41.230
to kill Clay and...

1:12:41.310 --> 1:12:42.770
Uh, call Levi too.

1:12:42.850 --> 1:12:45.690
You and I have nothing
to talk about, asshole.

1:12:45.770 --> 1:12:47.860
I think we do.

1:12:48.820 --> 1:12:50.820
I need some cash.

1:12:50.900 --> 1:12:53.370
Fifty grand to be exact.

1:12:53.450 --> 1:12:55.780
And you are gonna provide it
to me by the end of the week.

1:12:55.870 --> 1:12:57.660
Yeah, well, I don't have
that kind of money.

1:12:57.750 --> 1:12:59.390
And even if I did,
you're the last person on earth

1:12:59.410 --> 1:13:01.830
I'd give it to.
So get the fuck out of my bar.

1:13:04.590 --> 1:13:06.670
You will give me that cash

1:13:06.750 --> 1:13:08.510
or whoop,

1:13:08.590 --> 1:13:12.890
something bad is gonna
happen to this bar.

1:13:12.970 --> 1:13:15.680
Or better yet, how about that
sweet little blonde of yours?

1:13:15.760 --> 1:13:17.680
You know, the one
with the wide innocent eyes.

1:13:17.770 --> 1:13:21.020
I'll bet you anything,
she'll fetch at least 50 grand

1:13:21.100 --> 1:13:23.440
on the black market.

1:13:23.520 --> 1:13:25.860
I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

1:13:25.940 --> 1:13:30.570
Oh, yes, you should have.

1:13:30.650 --> 1:13:32.320
But you didn't.

1:13:32.400 --> 1:13:34.780
And so here we are.

1:13:34.870 --> 1:13:36.950
Nice little family reunion.

1:13:38.540 --> 1:13:42.540
Fifty grand. Make it happen,
you got three days.

1:13:42.620 --> 1:13:46.000
Or we could let natural
selection take its course.

1:13:48.050 --> 1:13:51.670
Do not fuck with me on this.
Do not.

1:13:51.760 --> 1:13:55.340
If you do, the consequences
will be brutal!

1:13:57.350 --> 1:13:59.430
Three days!

1:14:00.270 --> 1:14:02.350
I'll be in touch.

1:14:07.730 --> 1:14:09.820
Fuck.

1:14:18.070 --> 1:14:20.160
Jesus!

1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:27.880
Where the fuck is he?

1:14:27.960 --> 1:14:29.420
Where's Samantha? Is she okay?

1:14:29.500 --> 1:14:31.090
She was down here
when Wyatt came in

1:14:31.170 --> 1:14:32.470
and saw him at his finest.

1:14:32.550 --> 1:14:34.340
Fucking asshole.

1:14:34.420 --> 1:14:35.690
I sent her
upstairs, she called you?

1:14:35.720 --> 1:14:36.720
She called Katrina.

1:14:36.760 --> 1:14:38.350
She insisted on coming with us.

1:14:38.430 --> 1:14:39.740
I sent her up to the apartment
the backway,

1:14:39.760 --> 1:14:41.430
so Samantha wouldn't be alone.

1:14:41.510 --> 1:14:43.680
After all this time,
what the hell did he want?

1:14:43.770 --> 1:14:45.850
Money.

1:14:45.940 --> 1:14:47.020
Fifty grand to be exact.

1:14:47.100 --> 1:14:48.980
Somehow he found out I own a bar

1:14:49.060 --> 1:14:50.690
and he needs a quick infusion
of cash

1:14:50.770 --> 1:14:52.730
and he thinks
I'm gonna give it to him.

1:14:52.820 --> 1:14:54.360
Fucker.

1:14:54.440 --> 1:14:56.320
You should
have killed him, Clay.

1:14:56.400 --> 1:14:58.620
Man, you know I would've
helped you bury the body

1:14:58.700 --> 1:15:00.780
or feed him to the sharks.

1:15:00.870 --> 1:15:03.250
Really?

1:15:03.330 --> 1:15:05.160
Dude, you're such
a fucking killjoy.

1:15:05.250 --> 1:15:07.010
I'm just trying to save
a pretty boy like you

1:15:07.080 --> 1:15:09.630
from going to prison
and becoming someone's bitch.

1:15:09.710 --> 1:15:11.790
Yeah, I need a drink.

1:15:16.630 --> 1:15:18.680
Wyatt, huh?

1:15:18.760 --> 1:15:20.850
Yeah.

1:15:21.850 --> 1:15:23.720
You okay?

1:15:23.810 --> 1:15:26.060
I'll be fine.

1:15:26.140 --> 1:15:27.450
I thought you could use
something stronger

1:15:27.480 --> 1:15:29.350
than your normal
pansy ass spritzer.

1:15:29.440 --> 1:15:31.310
Orange juice, straight up.

1:15:31.400 --> 1:15:35.150
Always a comedian, aren't you?

1:15:35.230 --> 1:15:37.320
Thanks, man.

1:15:45.080 --> 1:15:46.830
There's more, guys.

1:15:46.910 --> 1:15:49.460
Wyatt gave me three days
to come up with the money.

1:15:49.540 --> 1:15:51.420
He sounded desperate,
so I'm assuming

1:15:51.500 --> 1:15:53.210
he's in some kind of trouble.

1:15:53.290 --> 1:15:56.130
Yeah, well, he can rot in hell
for all I care.

1:15:59.720 --> 1:16:01.260
But you're not thinking
of actually

1:16:01.340 --> 1:16:02.530
giving him the money, are you?

1:16:02.550 --> 1:16:03.740
Well, it's not my first option,

1:16:03.760 --> 1:16:05.350
but he did threaten Samantha.

1:16:05.430 --> 1:16:08.480
Said that he could get 50 grand
for her in the black market.

1:16:08.560 --> 1:16:10.310
Jesus.

1:16:10.390 --> 1:16:12.020
The fucker
is into human trafficking now?

1:16:12.110 --> 1:16:13.610
Now we all know
what he's capable of.

1:16:13.690 --> 1:16:15.650
I wouldn't be surprised.
Bottom line is this.

1:16:15.730 --> 1:16:18.610
I can't keep Samantha locked up
in my apartment forever.

1:16:18.700 --> 1:16:22.530
And I don't wanna give Wyatt
what he wants.

1:16:22.620 --> 1:16:26.160
But if anything happened
to her, it would kill me.

1:16:26.240 --> 1:16:27.660
Nothing's happening to her.

1:16:27.750 --> 1:16:29.210
Let me run his name
in the system,

1:16:29.290 --> 1:16:31.330
I'm sure he's got a rap sheet
a mile long.

1:16:31.420 --> 1:16:33.290
Look, the next time
he comes in here

1:16:33.380 --> 1:16:35.050
we take him into custody
and bust him

1:16:35.130 --> 1:16:36.380
for blackmail and extortion.

1:16:36.460 --> 1:16:38.010
So, he gets a slap on the wrist

1:16:38.090 --> 1:16:39.690
and he's back out
on the street in two weeks?

1:16:39.720 --> 1:16:42.550
It's not ideal.

1:16:42.640 --> 1:16:45.640
But just give me 24 hours to see
what I can come up with.

1:16:45.720 --> 1:16:49.100
I think feeding him to the
sharks is still the better idea.

1:16:49.180 --> 1:16:51.480
Okay.
I don't care what happens to me.

1:16:51.560 --> 1:16:53.160
I just need to know
that she's gonna be okay.

1:16:53.190 --> 1:16:55.900
Consider it done.
I'll get eyes on her ASAP.

1:16:55.980 --> 1:16:57.820
Thanks, man.

1:16:57.900 --> 1:16:59.990
Of course.

1:17:37.980 --> 1:17:40.150
Clay, it's me.

1:17:40.230 --> 1:17:42.320
So, what's up?

1:17:44.450 --> 1:17:46.410
Jesus, I'm sorry.

1:17:46.490 --> 1:17:47.660
What're you doing up?

1:17:47.740 --> 1:17:49.700
I couldn't sleep, just like you.

1:17:49.790 --> 1:17:51.870
Go back to bed.

1:17:56.590 --> 1:17:59.170
Tell me how you got those scars.

1:18:00.630 --> 1:18:02.720
It doesn't matter.

1:18:03.800 --> 1:18:06.800
Every single thing
about you matters to me

1:18:06.890 --> 1:18:10.350
including how you got
those scars.

1:18:10.430 --> 1:18:13.980
Was it that man
that came in today?

1:18:14.060 --> 1:18:15.440
Did he hurt you?

1:18:15.520 --> 1:18:17.730
Leave it alone.

1:18:17.810 --> 1:18:19.320
You don't have to
keep everything

1:18:19.400 --> 1:18:21.490
bottled inside of you.

1:18:23.780 --> 1:18:26.570
Samantha, my past is dark

1:18:26.660 --> 1:18:29.700
and it's ugly and is twisted.

1:18:29.790 --> 1:18:31.990
And the last thing I want
is to put images in your head

1:18:32.080 --> 1:18:34.080
that don't need to be there.

1:18:34.160 --> 1:18:37.750
So... leave me alone

1:18:37.830 --> 1:18:40.170
before I do something
we'll both regret.

1:18:40.250 --> 1:18:43.970
I will never regret anything
that I've done with you.

1:18:44.050 --> 1:18:46.130
Ever.

1:19:34.850 --> 1:19:36.930
Samantha, I want you
so fucking bad.

1:19:38.190 --> 1:19:40.270
I'm yours.

1:20:06.970 --> 1:20:09.050
Thank you.

1:20:18.310 --> 1:20:22.940
You asked about the scars
on my back.

1:20:23.020 --> 1:20:25.150
Yeah.

1:20:25.230 --> 1:20:27.320
Will you tell me?

1:20:38.330 --> 1:20:43.920
My mother was a, a crack addict

1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:46.800
and a prostitute.

1:20:46.880 --> 1:20:49.380
Mason, Levi, and I, we all have
different fathers,

1:20:49.470 --> 1:20:55.390
all from a different John,
we never knew them.

1:20:55.470 --> 1:21:00.350
We never had a man's influence
in our lives.

1:21:00.430 --> 1:21:02.120
I mean, there were a lot of guys
who lived with us

1:21:02.150 --> 1:21:04.650
but they were all addicts

1:21:04.730 --> 1:21:06.820
just like mom.

1:21:09.190 --> 1:21:13.110
And since she was never
conscious or aware enough

1:21:13.200 --> 1:21:17.490
to take care of us,
I took that on pretty young.

1:21:17.580 --> 1:21:19.750
That must have been so hard.

1:21:21.830 --> 1:21:24.710
I was six when Levi was born.

1:21:24.790 --> 1:21:27.340
Always made sure
he had his bottle.

1:21:27.420 --> 1:21:29.630
Changed his diaper the best
that I could.

1:21:31.760 --> 1:21:34.890
I made these serial sandwiches
for Mason and I

1:21:34.970 --> 1:21:36.030
when we had food in the house,

1:21:36.050 --> 1:21:37.560
but...

1:21:37.640 --> 1:21:41.020
lot of times
we just went to bed hungry.

1:21:41.100 --> 1:21:44.270
Why didn't Social Services
step in?

1:21:44.350 --> 1:21:46.570
Well, we lived in the projects.

1:21:46.650 --> 1:21:49.610
Neighbors didn't care, so our
mother was never reported.

1:21:51.740 --> 1:21:56.280
In her lucid moments
whenever I complained, she...

1:21:56.370 --> 1:21:59.750
she put the fear of God in me.

1:21:59.830 --> 1:22:02.330
Said that if I told anybody,
Social Services

1:22:02.410 --> 1:22:03.960
would split us up forever.

1:22:04.040 --> 1:22:06.130
That's awful.

1:22:07.880 --> 1:22:11.170
So, I went to school
and I was a good kid

1:22:11.260 --> 1:22:14.180
because I was afraid if I did
anything wrong

1:22:14.260 --> 1:22:17.470
I would lose my brothers.

1:22:17.550 --> 1:22:19.430
I did what I had to do,
raise Mason, Levi

1:22:19.510 --> 1:22:22.060
the best way I could.

1:22:22.140 --> 1:22:25.440
Try to keep them out of trouble.

1:22:25.520 --> 1:22:28.270
They were lucky to have you.

1:22:28.360 --> 1:22:32.360
When I was 15, our mother
got involved with Wyatt.

1:22:32.440 --> 1:22:37.450
He moved in,
kept her doped up on pills,

1:22:37.530 --> 1:22:38.620
pimped her out for cash,

1:22:38.700 --> 1:22:39.780
All the while running these

1:22:39.830 --> 1:22:42.580
shitty little side businesses.

1:22:42.660 --> 1:22:46.630
And while she was out at night,

1:22:46.710 --> 1:22:50.630
he terrorized us.

1:22:50.710 --> 1:22:51.810
One of the things he'd do
would be

1:22:51.840 --> 1:22:55.760
to, uh, pin me down
on the ground

1:22:55.840 --> 1:22:59.680
and... press a lit cigarette

1:22:59.760 --> 1:23:02.310
into my back

1:23:02.390 --> 1:23:06.310
burning these... holes.

1:23:08.650 --> 1:23:12.400
That sick bastard would get off
of me screaming.

1:23:12.490 --> 1:23:16.320
And the more I squirmed
and cried, the more he

1:23:16.400 --> 1:23:21.200
pressed... harder

1:23:21.280 --> 1:23:23.290
and longer.

1:23:23.370 --> 1:23:25.660
But he didn't do it
to my brothers.

1:23:28.540 --> 1:23:30.880
There were times when they would
just stand there

1:23:30.960 --> 1:23:34.090
watching helplessly.

1:23:34.170 --> 1:23:36.300
I told them not to get involved.

1:23:39.590 --> 1:23:41.850
And one day our mother
was arrested for possession

1:23:41.930 --> 1:23:44.640
solicitation and it was
her fifth offence,

1:23:44.730 --> 1:23:47.100
so she was sentenced
to 18 months

1:23:47.190 --> 1:23:49.560
and...

1:23:49.650 --> 1:23:52.650
somehow that bitch was able

1:23:52.730 --> 1:23:55.110
to appoint Wyatt
as our legal guardian.

1:23:56.490 --> 1:23:58.570
And the abuse got worse.

1:24:00.030 --> 1:24:03.030
Why would she do that you
and your brothers?

1:24:03.120 --> 1:24:04.370
Who knows.

1:24:04.450 --> 1:24:05.570
Probably made the most sense

1:24:05.620 --> 1:24:08.710
to her drug-addled brain.

1:24:10.710 --> 1:24:12.420
What happened to her?

1:24:12.500 --> 1:24:14.170
She served three months,

1:24:14.250 --> 1:24:16.340
had a stroke and died.

1:24:18.630 --> 1:24:21.680
And that's when Wyatt decided
that we were now his property

1:24:21.760 --> 1:24:25.890
and that he was gonna do
whatever he wanted.

1:24:25.970 --> 1:24:27.580
The thought of Wyatt being
our legal guardian

1:24:27.600 --> 1:24:31.810
until I turned 18 scared
the shit out of me.

1:24:31.900 --> 1:24:33.380
I knew he'd do anything
and everything

1:24:33.440 --> 1:24:35.980
to go after Mason and Levi.

1:24:36.070 --> 1:24:38.490
Pimp 'em out,
get them hooked on drugs.

1:24:38.570 --> 1:24:40.070
Anything.

1:24:40.150 --> 1:24:43.280
So, I, uh...

1:24:43.370 --> 1:24:45.080
I stole a butcher knife

1:24:45.160 --> 1:24:47.250
from a store...

1:24:52.790 --> 1:24:54.880
Tell me.

1:24:57.470 --> 1:24:59.670
I came home one day and...

1:25:02.180 --> 1:25:04.260
Wyatt had Levi cornered.

1:25:05.890 --> 1:25:08.390
He already backhanded him
a few times.

1:25:10.100 --> 1:25:14.150
I told Levi to run and he locked
himself in the bathroom.

1:25:16.480 --> 1:25:18.570
And then Wyatt came after me.

1:25:20.740 --> 1:25:25.240
I pulled the knife and it was

1:25:25.330 --> 1:25:27.200
so much running through me.

1:25:27.290 --> 1:25:29.370
I swore I was gonna kill
the fucker.

1:25:31.540 --> 1:25:32.920
Wyatt was much stronger
back then

1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:35.750
and we just got him locked.

1:25:37.510 --> 1:25:39.760
I pushed him back
and gave him a nasty cut

1:25:39.840 --> 1:25:41.550
on the side of his face.

1:25:41.630 --> 1:25:44.010
- You gave him that scar?
- Yeah.

1:25:44.090 --> 1:25:47.180
Stabbed him in the arm too.

1:25:47.260 --> 1:25:48.870
It was enough for him to realize
that he couldn't mess

1:25:48.890 --> 1:25:51.060
with us anymore
and he finally left.

1:25:53.270 --> 1:25:55.350
Haven't seen him until today.

1:25:59.610 --> 1:26:02.360
Your brothers were so young.

1:26:02.450 --> 1:26:04.660
What did you do
after Wyatt was gone?

1:26:06.780 --> 1:26:09.490
Mason was 12 and Levi was 10.

1:26:11.620 --> 1:26:13.750
I wasn't gonna lose them
to foster care

1:26:13.830 --> 1:26:16.080
so for the next couple of months
until I turned 18

1:26:16.170 --> 1:26:17.960
I worked any and every kind
of job I could

1:26:18.050 --> 1:26:21.760
just to pay the bills
and stay off the radar.

1:26:21.840 --> 1:26:24.800
Went dumpster diving for food.

1:26:24.890 --> 1:26:27.300
That's when...

1:26:27.390 --> 1:26:30.470
that's when Jerry saw me.

1:26:30.560 --> 1:26:34.100
And he gave me my first job here
at the bar.

1:26:34.190 --> 1:26:36.440
Gave me my first
weekly paycheck.

1:26:40.150 --> 1:26:41.610
Levi was a good kid.

1:26:41.690 --> 1:26:43.280
He tried to stay out of trouble

1:26:43.360 --> 1:26:46.410
but Mason...

1:26:46.490 --> 1:26:48.530
what a goddamn hellion.

1:26:48.620 --> 1:26:50.490
He was that at young, huh?

1:26:50.580 --> 1:26:52.200
I think Mason
was just testing me

1:26:52.290 --> 1:26:55.170
because he was afraid I'd leave

1:26:55.250 --> 1:26:57.330
just like our mother.

1:26:58.710 --> 1:27:00.670
She may not have been there
in a way that mattered

1:27:00.750 --> 1:27:04.380
but she was still mom.

1:27:10.260 --> 1:27:12.560
We never had a dad, so...

1:27:15.770 --> 1:27:17.850
the whole thing kinda messed
with his head.

1:27:19.520 --> 1:27:21.610
Still does, I think.

1:27:25.700 --> 1:27:29.120
Your brothers are good men

1:27:29.200 --> 1:27:32.790
because of everything
that you did for them.

1:27:35.080 --> 1:27:38.830
Except here we are...

1:27:38.920 --> 1:27:42.250
facing the man
who fucked all of us up.

1:27:45.340 --> 1:27:47.510
I never thought
I'd see him again.

1:27:56.230 --> 1:27:58.310
Hey.

1:27:58.390 --> 1:28:00.480
Hey.

1:28:00.810 --> 1:28:02.480
What's this?

1:28:02.570 --> 1:28:04.650
It's just been a long day.

1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:08.450
It's okay.

1:28:32.890 --> 1:28:34.970
What... Why are you packing?

1:28:40.690 --> 1:28:42.310
Samantha.

1:28:42.400 --> 1:28:44.530
I'm going home.

1:28:47.070 --> 1:28:50.280
I... I don't understand.
I thought...

1:28:50.360 --> 1:28:52.570
You're just gonna give up
what you were fighting for?

1:28:52.660 --> 1:28:54.740
It's what I need to do.

1:28:58.540 --> 1:29:00.170
Okay.

1:29:00.250 --> 1:29:03.040
I don't want you leaving
without some kind of security

1:29:03.130 --> 1:29:05.250
not without this issue
with Wyatt resolved.

1:29:05.340 --> 1:29:08.720
I called my father and he's
sending over his private car

1:29:08.800 --> 1:29:11.630
and personal security, so they
should be here any minute.

1:29:15.810 --> 1:29:17.890
I have to go.

1:29:57.510 --> 1:30:00.390
Clay. Clay.

1:30:01.980 --> 1:30:03.940
Clay. Jesus!

1:30:04.020 --> 1:30:05.790
I know Samantha leaving
has thrown you for a loop,

1:30:05.810 --> 1:30:07.580
but I need you to pay attention
to what I'm about to tell you.

1:30:07.610 --> 1:30:09.250
I'm fine.
What'd you find out about Wyatt?

1:30:09.280 --> 1:30:11.320
He has a warrant out
for his arrest.

1:30:11.400 --> 1:30:13.860
- For what?
- First-degree murder.

1:30:13.940 --> 1:30:15.490
What did he do?

1:30:15.570 --> 1:30:17.790
Uh, about a year ago
a woman he was living with

1:30:17.870 --> 1:30:20.410
who's been arrested numerous
times for drug possession,

1:30:20.500 --> 1:30:22.580
solicitation was found dead.

1:30:22.670 --> 1:30:24.110
His DNA was all over
the crime scene,

1:30:24.170 --> 1:30:25.750
but they couldn't find him.

1:30:25.830 --> 1:30:27.810
Must've been layin' low
so they couldn't catch him.

1:30:27.840 --> 1:30:30.380
Whoever's after him now must be
scarier than going to prison.

1:30:30.460 --> 1:30:33.220
Well, the detective working
the case is setting up a sting

1:30:33.300 --> 1:30:34.550
to bring him into custody

1:30:34.630 --> 1:30:36.970
whenever, wherever
he tells you to meet him.

1:30:37.050 --> 1:30:38.780
There's more than enough
evidence to bring Wyatt

1:30:38.810 --> 1:30:40.270
into custody.

1:30:40.350 --> 1:30:41.560
Murder is a capital charge,

1:30:41.640 --> 1:30:44.980
which means,
life without parole.

1:30:45.060 --> 1:30:47.150
He's gonna rot in prison.

1:30:48.650 --> 1:30:51.570
All you need to do is let me
know the time and the place

1:30:51.650 --> 1:30:53.280
as soon as you hear from Wyatt.

1:30:53.360 --> 1:30:56.070
And the PD's gonna take care
of the rest.

1:30:56.160 --> 1:30:57.700
Chances are
he's gonna come here first.

1:30:57.780 --> 1:30:59.620
Then tell him you got to
pick up the cash

1:30:59.700 --> 1:31:01.370
and you'll meet him
somewhere neutral.

1:31:01.450 --> 1:31:04.160
And then,
call me with the details.

1:31:04.250 --> 1:31:05.790
Okay.

1:31:05.870 --> 1:31:07.960
Alright.

1:31:09.210 --> 1:31:11.800
And once that's done,
you need to keep your ass here.

1:31:11.880 --> 1:31:14.380
Until I confirm we have Wyatt
in custody.

1:31:14.470 --> 1:31:16.550
- Got it?
- Got it.

1:31:17.550 --> 1:31:19.300
Thanks.

1:31:19.390 --> 1:31:21.470
Come here.

1:31:21.970 --> 1:31:24.060
We're gonna get him.

1:31:34.150 --> 1:31:36.320
Hey, sorry, buddy.
We don't open till 4:00.

1:31:36.400 --> 1:31:38.410
Uh, actually, I'm here
to speak with Clay Kincaid.

1:31:38.490 --> 1:31:40.200
That's me.

1:31:40.280 --> 1:31:42.290
Mind if I come in
for a few minutes?

1:31:42.370 --> 1:31:44.710
Uh, sure.

1:31:44.790 --> 1:31:47.540
What can I do for you, Mister...

1:31:47.630 --> 1:31:49.960
Blackwell.

1:31:50.040 --> 1:31:52.130
Harrison Blackwell III.

1:31:55.130 --> 1:31:57.840
So, Samantha told you about me.

1:31:57.930 --> 1:31:59.850
Yes, she did.

1:31:59.930 --> 1:32:02.010
What can I do for you?

1:32:02.970 --> 1:32:04.970
I'm here to deliver a package.

1:32:05.060 --> 1:32:07.140
And I wanted to meet the man

1:32:07.230 --> 1:32:10.400
that Samantha has given up
her new independent life for.

1:32:10.480 --> 1:32:12.730
Excuse me?

1:32:12.820 --> 1:32:14.570
She didn't tell you, did she?

1:32:14.650 --> 1:32:15.900
Tell me what?

1:32:15.990 --> 1:32:18.110
Samantha called her father
yesterday

1:32:18.200 --> 1:32:20.780
and told him to that
she needed money immediately.

1:32:20.870 --> 1:32:23.240
That you were in trouble,
and that she wanted to help.

1:32:23.330 --> 1:32:26.950
And Conrad Jameson,
as you've already surmised

1:32:27.040 --> 1:32:28.960
struck a bargain...

1:32:29.040 --> 1:32:32.210
her return home,
an agreement to marry me

1:32:32.290 --> 1:32:35.590
in exchange for giving you
50 grand.

1:32:37.130 --> 1:32:39.050
The thing is,
we've known all along

1:32:39.130 --> 1:32:40.760
where Samantha has been.

1:32:40.840 --> 1:32:43.600
The night she left,
Conrad's security firm

1:32:43.680 --> 1:32:46.180
found out exactly where she was.

1:32:46.270 --> 1:32:48.270
They've updated Conrad daily,

1:32:48.350 --> 1:32:51.980
and when she ended up moving in
with you and staying here,

1:32:52.060 --> 1:32:53.830
he was provided
with a full background report

1:32:53.900 --> 1:32:55.780
on you as well.

1:32:55.860 --> 1:32:58.990
If Conrad knew
where Samantha was

1:32:59.070 --> 1:33:00.860
why didn't he just come get her?

1:33:00.940 --> 1:33:03.200
He saw something in your report
that assured him that

1:33:03.280 --> 1:33:06.580
you were trustworthy.

1:33:06.660 --> 1:33:08.620
So, he figured that Samantha
just needed to

1:33:08.710 --> 1:33:13.790
sow some wild oats
before she settled down...

1:33:13.880 --> 1:33:15.960
and married me.

1:33:17.420 --> 1:33:18.880
For the sake
of the investment firm?

1:33:18.970 --> 1:33:20.430
Hm.

1:33:20.510 --> 1:33:22.590
Correct.

1:33:23.720 --> 1:33:26.510
I know Samantha doesn't love me.

1:33:26.600 --> 1:33:28.640
Quite frankly,
I don't love her either.

1:33:28.730 --> 1:33:31.560
She's too spirited.
She's way too independent.

1:33:31.650 --> 1:33:34.150
And I know she'd be miserable
in a structured marriage

1:33:34.230 --> 1:33:35.940
like ours would be.

1:33:36.020 --> 1:33:38.570
She wants her own life,
her own career.

1:33:40.610 --> 1:33:42.490
And the fact that
she gave it all up

1:33:42.570 --> 1:33:44.830
and agreed
to her father's conditions

1:33:44.910 --> 1:33:47.240
in exchange for this money

1:33:47.330 --> 1:33:51.000
tells me just how important
you are to her.

1:33:51.080 --> 1:33:54.040
Why,
why are you telling me this?

1:33:54.130 --> 1:33:57.170
Despite everything,
I'd rather see Samantha

1:33:57.250 --> 1:34:00.170
living the kind of life
that she wants to...

1:34:00.260 --> 1:34:02.260
with the kind of person
that's going to support her

1:34:02.300 --> 1:34:04.390
and make her happy.

1:34:05.300 --> 1:34:07.890
And that man is not me.

1:34:12.140 --> 1:34:14.230
Have a good afternoon,
Mr. Kincaid.

1:34:15.730 --> 1:34:17.820
Thanks.

1:34:36.630 --> 1:34:37.710
Wyatt...

1:35:24.260 --> 1:35:25.730
He's on the move,
he's on the move, get him.

1:35:25.760 --> 1:35:27.890
Hold it, hold it.
Hold up, hold up.

1:35:31.930 --> 1:35:36.020
Wyatt Dawson,
you're under arrest for murder.

1:35:36.100 --> 1:35:38.310
- Cuff him.
- Hands behind your back.

1:35:50.160 --> 1:35:52.330
- Hey.
- We got him.

1:35:52.410 --> 1:35:54.620
Samantha is safe.

1:36:30.050 --> 1:36:33.450
Clay Kincaid
to see Conrad Jameson.

1:36:36.330 --> 1:36:38.410
Hi, good afternoon.

1:36:51.430 --> 1:36:54.260
Mr. Jameson.

1:36:54.350 --> 1:36:56.120
I appreciate the money
you sent to help me out,

1:36:56.140 --> 1:36:58.560
but I'm returning all of it.

1:36:58.640 --> 1:37:01.100
I don't want it.
I don't need it.

1:37:01.190 --> 1:37:02.620
In fact, you had to have known
that I was sitting

1:37:02.650 --> 1:37:04.130
on a couple of million dollars
in the bank

1:37:04.150 --> 1:37:05.690
since you did
a background check on me.

1:37:05.780 --> 1:37:08.490
So, why bother?

1:37:08.570 --> 1:37:10.570
Two reasons actually.

1:37:10.660 --> 1:37:13.530
One, it worked to bring
Samantha back home.

1:37:13.620 --> 1:37:18.120
And two, I wanted to see
what kind of man you truly are.

1:37:18.210 --> 1:37:19.350
Well, to be honest with you,
sir, I'm more than

1:37:19.370 --> 1:37:20.540
a little pissed to find out

1:37:20.620 --> 1:37:22.330
the money came
with an ultimatum.

1:37:22.420 --> 1:37:24.350
I was getting little tired
of waiting for my daughter

1:37:24.380 --> 1:37:26.590
to come to her senses
and come home.

1:37:26.670 --> 1:37:28.550
So you blackmailed her?

1:37:28.630 --> 1:37:31.840
She's my child,
I want the best for her.

1:37:31.930 --> 1:37:33.030
Then let her make her own
decisions.

1:37:33.050 --> 1:37:34.550
Let her live her own life.

1:37:34.640 --> 1:37:38.390
That is, uh, difficult
for a man like me.

1:37:40.310 --> 1:37:42.480
Well, sir, it's not about
what you want.

1:37:42.560 --> 1:37:44.110
Hm.

1:37:44.190 --> 1:37:47.530
And just where do you think
you fit into her life?

1:37:47.610 --> 1:37:50.570
Same answer, sir. It's not about
what I want either.

1:37:50.650 --> 1:37:53.280
I would do anything to make
Samantha happy.

1:37:53.370 --> 1:37:55.780
Happiness, the way you mean it

1:37:55.870 --> 1:37:57.540
is overrated.

1:37:57.620 --> 1:38:01.620
And you must be aware,
you're all wrong for her.

1:38:01.710 --> 1:38:05.210
Well, I may not be a member
of your investment firm,

1:38:05.290 --> 1:38:07.750
or someone from your...

1:38:07.840 --> 1:38:10.510
social circle, but I have never
felt anything as right

1:38:10.590 --> 1:38:12.300
as being with Samantha.

1:38:12.380 --> 1:38:13.400
And you're confident that

1:38:13.430 --> 1:38:14.680
she feels the same?

1:38:14.760 --> 1:38:16.010
Yes.

1:38:16.100 --> 1:38:17.100
I am.

1:38:19.100 --> 1:38:21.810
Let me tell you something, son.

1:38:21.890 --> 1:38:25.770
I didn't like what I saw
in your background check.

1:38:25.860 --> 1:38:28.400
Your past leaves a lot
to be desired.

1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:32.700
But, the man you've become

1:38:32.780 --> 1:38:34.050
despite how you grew up...

1:38:36.370 --> 1:38:37.620
impresses me.

1:38:37.700 --> 1:38:39.120
I admire the way you have

1:38:39.200 --> 1:38:40.450
overcome adversity,

1:38:40.540 --> 1:38:41.790
raised your brothers,

1:38:41.870 --> 1:38:44.250
help people
who are less fortunate.

1:38:44.330 --> 1:38:46.130
Well, you took care of Samantha

1:38:46.210 --> 1:38:48.590
when a lesser man would've
taken advantage of her.

1:38:48.670 --> 1:38:50.380
Especially after finding out
who she is,

1:38:50.460 --> 1:38:52.130
and, well, you know...

1:38:52.210 --> 1:38:53.510
what she's worth.

1:38:53.590 --> 1:38:55.220
Well, none of that matters
to me.

1:38:55.300 --> 1:38:57.390
No offense.

1:38:58.430 --> 1:39:00.770
I believe you.

1:39:00.850 --> 1:39:05.480
Still, I would rather
she marry Harrison.

1:39:05.560 --> 1:39:10.320
The firm will remain
in the family.

1:39:10.400 --> 1:39:13.450
But here you are...

1:39:13.530 --> 1:39:18.330
And an hour ago, Samantha told
her mother and me that

1:39:18.410 --> 1:39:22.790
despite our agreement she was
going back to you tonight.

1:39:24.160 --> 1:39:26.370
She's determined to be with you.

1:39:26.460 --> 1:39:29.460
She's defiant, stubborn...

1:39:29.550 --> 1:39:31.880
She's independent and proud,
just like you.

1:39:37.260 --> 1:39:39.930
I don't want to
lose my only child...

1:39:40.010 --> 1:39:42.430
which I will do,
if I try to do anything

1:39:42.520 --> 1:39:44.890
to keep her away from you.

1:39:44.980 --> 1:39:47.440
I promise that I'll do
everything in my power

1:39:47.520 --> 1:39:50.020
to give Samantha a good life.

1:39:50.110 --> 1:39:52.490
And I will protect her
and respect her

1:39:52.570 --> 1:39:54.820
and be the kind of man
who deserves to be with someone

1:39:54.900 --> 1:39:56.990
as special as she is.

1:39:57.820 --> 1:39:59.910
I'm counting on that.

1:40:01.030 --> 1:40:02.870
I love your daughter.

1:40:02.950 --> 1:40:05.040
Do you mean it?

1:40:07.920 --> 1:40:09.540
Cupcake, you should know by now

1:40:09.630 --> 1:40:12.670
that I always mean what I say.

1:40:12.750 --> 1:40:14.800
I love you.

1:40:14.880 --> 1:40:18.010
More than I ever thought
I could love another person.

1:40:18.090 --> 1:40:20.680
And I don't wanna spend
another day without you in it...

1:40:20.760 --> 1:40:21.890
ever.

1:40:21.970 --> 1:40:24.060
Come here.

1:40:26.730 --> 1:40:29.520
I love you so much, Clay.

1:40:29.610 --> 1:40:31.900
There is no way
I could stay away from you.

1:40:31.980 --> 1:40:34.070
Me neither.

1:40:39.200 --> 1:40:41.280
Get used to it, dad!

1:40:47.580 --> 1:40:50.000
I am so sorry.

1:40:50.080 --> 1:40:52.840
Just don't ever leave me again.

1:40:52.920 --> 1:40:55.010
Never.

1:40:58.170 --> 1:41:00.260
Take me home.

1:41:08.770 --> 1:41:10.850
- Hey!
- Thank you.

1:41:13.310 --> 1:41:14.900
- Welcome back home, Samantha.
- Yes.

1:41:14.980 --> 1:41:16.000
- Oh, thank you.
- Cheers, guys.

1:41:16.030 --> 1:41:17.360
- Cheers!
- Cheers, guys!

1:41:17.440 --> 1:41:18.860
What're you baking for us
tomorrow?

1:41:18.940 --> 1:41:20.110
Cupcakes.

1:41:21.990 --> 1:41:23.030
Wow!

1:41:28.620 --> 1:41:30.710
Cupcakes.

1:41:38.010 --> 1:41:39.630
What do you think, Samantha...

1:41:43.550 --> 1:41:46.140
- Oh, jeez.
- Right. Damn!

1:41:46.220 --> 1:41:52.770
Get it!
