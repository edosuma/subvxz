00:12.897 --> 00:16.199
A little dramatic meeting
here, don't you think?

00:16.234 --> 00:18.868
I work with the smartest
people in the world.

00:18.903 --> 00:20.269
They cannot know we're talking.

00:20.305 --> 00:24.373
So you've come to a decision then.

00:24.409 --> 00:25.575
I have two conditions.

00:25.610 --> 00:27.877
You are hardly in any position...

00:27.912 --> 00:30.880
One, we do this, we do this my way.

00:30.915 --> 00:33.082
My design, my timetable.

00:33.117 --> 00:34.550
I don't want anyone getting hurt.

00:34.586 --> 00:38.387
I can live with that. The second?

00:38.423 --> 00:41.624
- You let the Librarians go.
- Absolutely not.

00:41.659 --> 00:44.060
You can have the Library
and all the artifacts.

00:44.095 --> 00:45.394
They are not part of the deal.

00:45.430 --> 00:46.662
Eve, they are dangerous.

00:46.698 --> 00:48.598
Their minds, their abilities...

00:48.633 --> 00:51.567
they and the artifacts
are safer with us.

00:51.603 --> 00:54.303
No, no. They're my friends.

00:54.339 --> 00:56.239
They're off the table. Non-negotiable.

00:56.274 --> 01:00.443
Or you can try and take the
Library without my help.

01:03.615 --> 01:05.013
Fine.

01:06.951 --> 01:09.919
So do we have a deal,
or did you drag me

01:09.954 --> 01:11.274
all the way out here for nothing?

01:11.298 --> 01:15.701
The Library is yours.

01:16.331 --> 01:23.667
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#33FF00"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#33FF00"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

01:28.139 --> 01:29.939
Cassandra, a watched pot never...

01:29.974 --> 01:31.107
I'm just antsy.

01:31.142 --> 01:32.942
We haven't had a case in weeks.

01:32.977 --> 01:35.945
Oh, relax. Enjoy it.

01:35.980 --> 01:38.114
A little downtime.
Catch up on some reading.

01:38.149 --> 01:41.617
This complete history of pre-Babylonian
pottery is riveting stuff.

01:41.653 --> 01:43.286
"Methods For Tattoo Removal."

01:43.321 --> 01:44.620
Don't sneak up on me, man.

01:44.656 --> 01:47.456
Touchy! Sheesh.

01:47.492 --> 01:50.459
Ah, Eve Baird, ladies and gentlemen.
Where have you been?

01:50.495 --> 01:52.962
- A little R&R?
- Find us a new case?

01:52.997 --> 01:55.949
Actually, I've been meeting with DOSA.

01:55.950 --> 01:57.151
- Cassandra: What?
- I'm sorry.

01:57.175 --> 01:58.501
- Did you just say DOS...
- Yes.

01:58.536 --> 02:01.003
- DOSA? DOSA?
- Just the one DOSA, yes.

02:01.039 --> 02:02.538
Eve, what's going on?

02:02.573 --> 02:06.309
Back in Tibet, in the train car,

02:06.344 --> 02:08.417
I wasn't abducted by Lamb's associates.

02:08.418 --> 02:11.514
It was DOSA. They tried to recruit me,

02:11.549 --> 02:13.416
scare me into turning
against the Library.

02:13.451 --> 02:16.118
Naturally, I said no,
but they keep trying.

02:16.154 --> 02:17.653
Why didn't you tell us?

02:17.689 --> 02:19.288
Sneaking around, withholding, I mean,

02:19.324 --> 02:21.917
- that's something Flynn would do, but not you.
- Hey!

02:21.918 --> 02:23.659
- But he's right.
- I'm sorry.

02:23.695 --> 02:25.255
I was trying to wait
for the right time.

02:25.279 --> 02:26.662
I didn't want to alarm you guys.

02:26.698 --> 02:28.331
But this could be good for us.

02:28.366 --> 02:30.232
I'm sorry. DOSA chasing
you is good for us?

02:30.268 --> 02:32.368
Are you mental? We hate DOSA!

02:32.403 --> 02:33.636
Okay, let's let her finish.

02:33.671 --> 02:35.171
Don't you see?

02:35.206 --> 02:36.569
They've taken me into their confidence.

02:36.570 --> 02:37.732
They've lowered their guard.

02:37.733 --> 02:39.208
While they were trying to play me...

02:39.243 --> 02:42.478
You were playing them. That's my Baird.

02:42.513 --> 02:43.935
I copied this from their files.

02:43.936 --> 02:45.025
Somehow DOSA got the lead

02:45.026 --> 02:46.582
on a location of a lost artifact.

02:46.617 --> 02:49.352
Let's see.

02:49.387 --> 02:51.454
Hello, yes.

02:51.489 --> 02:55.057
This is written in Lakota,
the language of the Sioux.

02:55.093 --> 02:58.160
"When Mercury shines
under the wolf moon,

02:58.196 --> 03:00.296
the six grandfathers will reveal

03:00.331 --> 03:03.132
- the great spider's web."
- Great spider's web?

03:03.167 --> 03:05.301
That's a map to
the Iktomi dreamcatcher.

03:05.302 --> 03:07.197
You mean those things they
sell at shopping mall kiosks?

03:07.198 --> 03:08.051
Jenkins: No, no, no. Not at all.

03:08.052 --> 03:10.230
It's a very powerful
Native American artifact.

03:10.231 --> 03:12.029
According to Sioux legend,
it has the power

03:12.030 --> 03:13.537
to control other people's dreams.

03:13.538 --> 03:15.299
This location's been lost
for over a century.

03:15.323 --> 03:16.645
Well, apparently not anymore.

03:16.681 --> 03:18.547
"Six grandfathers" is the Sioux word

03:18.583 --> 03:20.716
for a mountain in the Black Hills

03:20.752 --> 03:22.585
more commonly known as Mount Rushmore.

03:22.620 --> 03:24.553
Jenkins, we need to get
there before DOSA does.

03:24.589 --> 03:27.056
- Set a door.
- I can't go with you.

03:27.091 --> 03:29.191
You're not coming with us?

03:29.227 --> 03:30.747
I have to meet with DOSA and check in.

03:30.771 --> 03:32.676
If I don't, they'll become suspicious.

03:32.677 --> 03:34.477
She's right. Don't want
to lose our advantage.

03:34.501 --> 03:36.298
Get the artifact, come right back.

03:36.334 --> 03:38.508
If you get into any trouble, call.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.911
On second thought, I'm gonna sit
this one out. I'm worried about Eve.

03:44.912 --> 03:46.232
You think DOSA's got her rattled?

03:46.256 --> 03:47.176
I don't know. Maybe.

03:47.208 --> 03:48.649
I'm gonna talk to her. You three go.

03:48.673 --> 03:49.745
Jenkins: The door awaits.

03:49.781 --> 03:51.341
May I remind you, the clock is ticking.

03:51.365 --> 03:53.499
Go!

03:59.157 --> 04:00.589
Okay, so the map said something

04:00.625 --> 04:03.092
about Mercury shining
under a wolf moon.

04:03.127 --> 04:04.260
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:04.295 --> 04:05.535
We're just gonna jump right in?

04:05.559 --> 04:06.785
What about the big heads?

04:06.786 --> 04:08.275
Don't you guys want to
check out the big heads?

04:08.299 --> 04:09.739
We're on the clock. You heard Baird.

04:09.763 --> 04:11.434
All right, in the Sioux calendar,

04:11.469 --> 04:13.102
"wolf moons" are a name for January.

04:13.137 --> 04:15.104
January.

04:15.139 --> 04:16.423
All right, you guys are missing out.

04:16.425 --> 04:17.892
According to this,
George Washington's nose

04:17.916 --> 04:19.608
is a foot longer than the other three.

04:19.644 --> 04:21.188
Don't tell me you guys
aren't dying to see that.

04:21.212 --> 04:23.503
Okay, so we need to start
walking towards Mercury,

04:23.504 --> 04:25.134
which in January would be
in retrograde,

04:25.135 --> 04:29.118
putting it at 27.62 degrees
northeast... that-a way.

04:29.153 --> 04:31.454
No! That's the wrong direction!

04:31.489 --> 04:33.289
Come on, I had so many puns ready!

04:33.324 --> 04:35.758
Why the long face? Keep your chin up!

04:35.793 --> 04:38.294
What exactly are we looking for again?

04:38.329 --> 04:40.129
You'll know it when you see it.

04:40.164 --> 04:41.831
I just hope it's not a cave.

04:41.866 --> 04:44.026
I mean, is it just me, or is
anyone else sick of caves?

04:48.639 --> 04:51.907
- Guys?
- Yeah?

04:54.612 --> 04:58.814
It's a Sioux wood carving.
The owl symbolizes death.

04:58.850 --> 05:01.150
- What's that in its eye?
- It's a garnet crystal.

05:01.185 --> 05:02.685
Most commonly found on the coast.

05:02.720 --> 05:05.321
What's it doing here?

05:05.356 --> 05:09.325
Garnet crystals have an extremely
high level of light refraction.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.494
The map said light would
reveal something, right?

05:11.529 --> 05:12.862
Cassandra: Yeah.

05:18.269 --> 05:19.869
Hey!

05:21.539 --> 05:22.872
Guys.

05:29.447 --> 05:31.247
- What's it say?
- More Lakota.

05:31.282 --> 05:35.551
"Go to the sacred bear and
kneel before the ancestral fire.

05:35.586 --> 05:37.219
Only then will you find what you seek."

05:37.255 --> 05:38.854
Great. A scavenger hunt.

05:38.890 --> 05:40.689
Our whole job is a scavenger hunt.

05:40.725 --> 05:42.191
"Sacred bear" is a Sioux reference

05:42.226 --> 05:44.193
to a rock formation in Bear View Park.

05:44.228 --> 05:45.859
It's about an hour's hike from here.

05:45.860 --> 05:47.380
I'll call Jenkins to fire up the door.

05:48.399 --> 05:50.866
And no reception. Figures.

05:50.902 --> 05:52.601
Okay, well if we get a move on now,

05:52.637 --> 05:55.471
we should make it before sundown.
Come on, boys.

05:57.408 --> 05:59.208
Stone, you coming?

05:59.243 --> 06:01.744
This hide, it's not right.

06:01.779 --> 06:03.212
Come on, really?

06:03.247 --> 06:05.548
I'm from Oklahoma. I know hides.

06:05.583 --> 06:07.615
The Sioux tan their hides
with oak and sumac.

06:07.616 --> 06:09.012
It kept it rough around the edges.

06:09.013 --> 06:10.573
This thing looks like
it's store-bought.

06:10.597 --> 06:12.821
And the ink is fresh.

06:12.857 --> 06:14.723
What are you saying? The clue's a fake?

06:14.759 --> 06:17.560
I'm saying the whole
damn mission is a fake.

06:17.595 --> 06:18.995
DOSA sent us on a wild goose chase.

06:19.030 --> 06:21.430
So DOSA fed Baird
bad information. But why?

06:37.048 --> 06:39.882
Eve? Jenkins, have you seen Eve?

06:39.917 --> 06:44.253
What? Sorry, sir.

06:44.288 --> 06:45.721
Little situation here.

06:45.756 --> 06:47.423
What's going on?

06:47.458 --> 06:50.926
The door... it's been dismantled.

06:52.964 --> 06:54.964
It's the perimeter alarm.

07:02.473 --> 07:05.407
Is that Colonel Baird
leading DOSA into the library?

07:09.981 --> 07:12.481
Eve's working for DOSA?

07:17.863 --> 07:20.831
There must be two or three
dozen, heavily armed.

07:20.866 --> 07:22.666
How could she be working for DOSA?

07:22.701 --> 07:24.501
How could she do this to us?

07:24.536 --> 07:25.576
How could she do it to me?

07:25.600 --> 07:27.561
We cannot let them
reach the artifacts, Mr. Car...

07:27.585 --> 07:30.076
- She betrayed us!
- Yes, sir, it would seem so.

07:30.077 --> 07:31.321
And as much as that might hurt,

07:31.322 --> 07:32.562
we have to protect the Library.

07:32.586 --> 07:33.844
Yes, of course.

07:33.879 --> 07:35.345
I will take the south passage,

07:35.381 --> 07:36.555
see if I can slip past them,

07:36.556 --> 07:38.237
start sealing doors
and stashing artifacts.

07:38.261 --> 07:39.850
You hold them off as long as you can.

07:39.885 --> 07:42.486
I'll buy what time I can, sir.

07:49.128 --> 07:52.362
I had no idea it was this big.

07:52.398 --> 07:54.564
Bigger than you can imagine.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.033
Pack everything up.

07:56.068 --> 07:58.368
I want this place
cleared out by 2300 hours.

07:58.404 --> 08:01.705
- Let's go. Let's move.
- Split up in teams.

08:01.740 --> 08:02.839
I can't let you do that.

08:02.875 --> 08:04.808
Step aside, Jenkins.

08:04.843 --> 08:07.811
Colonel, I don't know what it
is you think you're doing,

08:07.846 --> 08:09.813
but in the history
of bad ideas... this?

08:09.848 --> 08:11.048
Right at the top.

08:11.083 --> 08:13.150
You're the caretaker. Jenkins.

08:13.185 --> 08:14.384
I heard about you.

08:14.420 --> 08:16.053
"Ornery" is the word they used.

08:16.088 --> 08:18.055
That's just from my friends.

08:18.090 --> 08:20.557
I mean, for you and
your backups singers,

08:20.592 --> 08:22.726
I'd be willing to get downright nasty.

08:22.761 --> 08:25.095
Jenkins, please. I don't
want you to get hurt.

08:25.130 --> 08:28.065
I wouldn't be worried
too much about me, Colonel.

08:28.100 --> 08:29.966
- I'm immortal.
- Oh, we know.

08:30.002 --> 08:32.068
That's why Baird gave us this.

08:45.084 --> 08:47.150
Are you sure you can reverse this?

08:47.186 --> 08:48.685
He's no good to me dead.

08:48.721 --> 08:50.194
Yeah.

08:50.358 --> 08:52.574
- All right, people, let's move it.
- Yes, General.

08:52.575 --> 08:54.858
Grab the artifacts
and get 'em out of here.

08:54.893 --> 08:56.827
You take those. I'll grab the spear.

09:09.742 --> 09:11.675
Man: Take that way. We'll go in here.

09:13.479 --> 09:15.145
Move, move!

09:19.752 --> 09:22.619
Yeah, you know what?
Check behind, as well.

09:22.654 --> 09:24.121
Just reach on over, it's fine.

09:24.156 --> 09:25.676
Man #2: Right, all the volumes, right?

09:25.700 --> 09:27.124
Reach up behind that shelf.

09:27.159 --> 09:29.526
Nah, nothing here. Just the books.

09:29.561 --> 09:31.441
- All right, you got it?
- Yeah, I got this end.

09:31.465 --> 09:33.298
- Let's go.
- Come on through.

09:33.999 --> 09:36.967
Let's close it back up.

09:37.002 --> 09:38.802
Jake: Thanks for the ride, man.
Appreciate it.

09:38.826 --> 09:40.159
Man: No problem.

09:41.140 --> 09:43.473
Got it.

09:43.509 --> 09:45.675
We're too late.

09:45.711 --> 09:47.110
- This is us.
- Lift it up.

09:47.146 --> 09:49.146
We gotta get closer.

09:49.181 --> 09:51.014
Man: Strap it down.

09:57.022 --> 10:00.023
- Sign here.
- Eve.

10:00.058 --> 10:01.158
Thank you.

10:01.193 --> 10:02.397
Ezekiel: I don't believe it.

10:02.398 --> 10:03.927
She sold us out.

10:10.536 --> 10:11.902
I'd like to have a word with him.

10:23.148 --> 10:25.916
I know you don't want to hear this,
Jenkins, but I had no choice.

10:25.951 --> 10:30.020
DOSA was gonna take the
Library with or without my help.

10:30.055 --> 10:31.822
At least this way,
I could make a deal...

10:31.857 --> 10:33.523
the artifacts for the Librarians.

10:33.559 --> 10:34.658
Everyone's spared.

10:34.693 --> 10:36.293
Apparently not everyone.

10:36.328 --> 10:39.196
I tried for your release.
They wouldn't have it.

10:39.231 --> 10:42.632
Of course not. My immortality
makes me a living artifact.

10:42.668 --> 10:45.869
Jenkins, please. I had to
protect the Librarians.

10:45.904 --> 10:48.038
It's my job. I'm their guardian.

10:48.073 --> 10:52.209
Your job? Your important job
was protecting their souls!

10:52.244 --> 10:55.712
And by doing this, you have
shattered them irrevocably.

10:55.747 --> 11:00.684
In one single act, you have destroyed
everything we have ever worked for.

11:00.719 --> 11:04.888
So go right ahead,
rationalize all you want.

11:04.923 --> 11:09.926
But the hard truth, Colonel?
No one was spared.

11:11.096 --> 11:16.066
Please just get me out of here.

11:16.101 --> 11:17.734
Let's go.

11:23.609 --> 11:26.109
- Hello?
- Flynn, where are you?

11:26.144 --> 11:29.079
Playing a little cat and mouse with
DOSA in the Library. How about you?

11:29.114 --> 11:31.299
Ezekiel: Inside the annex
doing the exact same thing.

11:31.683 --> 11:33.350
You're already back
from Mount Rushmore?

11:33.351 --> 11:34.584
Jake: It was a trap.

11:34.620 --> 11:36.060
DOSA sent us there to get rid of us.

11:36.088 --> 11:38.221
Flynn, it's Eve. She turned on us.

11:38.257 --> 11:40.957
She's helping DOSA pillage the library.

11:43.295 --> 11:45.262
I know.

11:45.297 --> 11:47.597
But, listen, we can't
think about that right now.

11:47.633 --> 11:49.766
Protecting the Library
has to come first.

11:49.801 --> 11:52.102
- Where's Jenkins?
- DOSA's got him.

11:52.137 --> 11:54.137
They loaded him onto a
truck to who knows where.

11:54.172 --> 11:56.372
You have to follow him.
You have to bring him back here.

11:56.373 --> 11:57.985
He'll know how to
initiate the fail-safe.

11:57.986 --> 11:58.991
Fail safe?

11:58.992 --> 12:00.782
You mean that thing when the
Serpent Brotherhood broke in

12:00.783 --> 12:02.582
and the Library folded
in on itself thing?

12:02.583 --> 12:04.383
Cutting the Library off
from the outside world

12:04.416 --> 12:05.782
is the only chance we've got.

12:05.817 --> 12:07.019
Thanks Judson and Charlene,

12:07.020 --> 12:08.999
Jenkins is the only one
who knows how to do it.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.280
You have to bring him back here.

12:10.304 --> 12:11.306
What about you?

12:11.307 --> 12:14.028
I'm gonna try and save as many
artifacts as I can until you get here.

12:14.052 --> 12:15.659
And, Flynn? We're so sorry.

12:15.694 --> 12:20.163
Yeah, me, too.

12:37.182 --> 12:40.984
It's never easy, is it?
Doing the right thing?

12:41.019 --> 12:42.652
When the dust settles,
I hope you realize

12:42.688 --> 12:46.156
how much you've helped
your country today.

12:46.191 --> 12:49.826
- I'm proud of you, Eve.
- Thank you, General,

12:49.861 --> 12:54.164
but my conscience is
the least of my concerns.

12:54.199 --> 12:56.333
There's a sarcophagus.

12:56.368 --> 12:58.335
It's an Egyptian deity called Apep.

12:58.370 --> 12:59.850
We've been looking everywhere for it.

12:59.874 --> 13:01.171
We just can't find it.

13:01.206 --> 13:03.006
That's because we have it.

13:03.041 --> 13:04.407
We retrieved it from Egypt.

13:04.443 --> 13:06.009
It's been in safe storage

13:06.044 --> 13:07.677
while we were setting
up the operations.

13:07.713 --> 13:09.393
Actually, it's being
delivered as we speak.

13:09.417 --> 13:11.014
You're telling me you have it, now?

13:11.049 --> 13:13.149
Yeah, it's completely secure.

13:13.185 --> 13:15.251
And I wouldn't worry about Apep.

13:15.287 --> 13:18.021
Took him into custody after
that whole Boston Museum mess.

13:18.056 --> 13:20.357
General, you don't understand.
You don't have Apep.

13:20.392 --> 13:22.025
You have the person he possessed.

13:22.060 --> 13:23.940
He's a dangerous spirit
who could be coming back

13:23.964 --> 13:25.695
to his sarcophagus to
rejuvenate his powers.

13:25.731 --> 13:29.366
Well, with our security
protocols, not a chance.

13:29.401 --> 13:30.800
But we have to be sure.

13:30.836 --> 13:35.238
Fine. I'll prove it to you. Come on.

13:38.744 --> 13:40.410
- Take us to the port.
- Mm-hmm.

14:00.866 --> 14:03.400
Keep rolling. Roll through.

14:03.435 --> 14:06.102
- Keep it coming.
- You're good.

14:07.439 --> 14:11.408
- All right, lock it up.
- Copy that...

14:11.443 --> 14:14.244
Make sure I'm on the list
for the no-admittance gate.

14:14.279 --> 14:16.913
- Right, got it.
- Good. A little more.

14:16.948 --> 14:19.783
Keep coming. More.

14:21.953 --> 14:23.119
A little to my left.

14:25.290 --> 14:28.124
Keep it coming. Keep it coming.

14:29.461 --> 14:30.960
All right, that's good!

14:32.130 --> 14:34.431
Drop it down.

14:34.466 --> 14:36.567
All right, okay.

14:36.902 --> 14:38.982
Looks like they're storing
the artifacts underground.

14:39.006 --> 14:40.770
Including Jenkins.

14:40.806 --> 14:42.939
Come on.

14:42.974 --> 14:45.775
- That's it!
- Another annex room.

15:00.826 --> 15:03.159
Hey. Go.

15:17.509 --> 15:19.008
Oh, my God.

15:23.225 --> 15:25.943
They built their own library.

15:47.907 --> 15:50.002
Look at this.

15:50.003 --> 15:52.571
Polycarbonate bulletproof
glass, titanium framing,

15:52.606 --> 15:55.273
magnetic fusion containment field.

15:55.309 --> 15:56.695
It's exactly like the Library,

15:56.696 --> 15:58.857
only instead of using magic
to contain the artifacts...

15:58.881 --> 16:00.080
They're using technology.

16:01.448 --> 16:03.315
Wait, where are all the guards?

16:03.350 --> 16:06.518
With security like this, who needs 'em?

16:10.023 --> 16:11.990
Poor thing.

16:12.025 --> 16:14.492
DOSA's found a way to trap 'em.

16:14.528 --> 16:16.995
It's like they studied
the artifacts beforehand.

16:17.030 --> 16:19.531
Jenkins!

16:21.368 --> 16:23.368
- Jones!
- Can you get us in?

16:23.403 --> 16:26.504
DOSA's good, but they're not that good.

16:26.540 --> 16:28.106
- Nice!
- Are you okay?

16:28.141 --> 16:29.774
- Are you hurt?
- He can't hear you.

16:29.810 --> 16:32.210
It's double-A polycarbonate.

16:32.246 --> 16:34.679
This thing's locked down
six ways from Sunday.

16:34.715 --> 16:36.514
Ezekiel, get in there.

16:36.550 --> 16:38.854
I would pick the lock,
if there was a lock to pick.

16:38.855 --> 16:40.015
I've never seen anything like this.

16:40.016 --> 16:41.256
I wouldn't know where to start.

16:41.280 --> 16:42.416
Maybe I can help. See this?

16:42.417 --> 16:44.776
It's asking you to calculate
the largest Mersenne prime,

16:44.777 --> 16:46.336
which is an extremely
rare class of numbers.

16:46.360 --> 16:48.000
Mersenne primes are
so large that it takes

16:48.024 --> 16:49.527
a computer a month to calculate them.

16:49.563 --> 16:52.030
But they don't have what I have.

16:52.065 --> 16:55.734
So maybe the answer to the equation
is the key to unlocking the door.

16:55.769 --> 16:57.569
Got it.

17:03.777 --> 17:07.378
Aah! What's happening?

17:07.414 --> 17:09.114
The air! It's compressing his lungs.

17:09.148 --> 17:11.849
- Well, make it stop.
- I can't!

17:15.155 --> 17:17.122
What the heck just happened?

17:17.156 --> 17:19.223
It's booby-trapped.

17:19.259 --> 17:21.826
I think it goes off if you
put in the wrong answer.

17:21.862 --> 17:24.061
I didn't put in the wrong answer.

17:24.097 --> 17:26.631
- Are you sure?
- Okay, she's sure.

17:26.666 --> 17:29.734
Look, maybe math is not
the key to the lock.

17:29.770 --> 17:31.336
These are Sumerian pictographs.

17:31.371 --> 17:33.004
This is the oldest
writing known to man.

17:33.005 --> 17:35.073
"If you feed me, I will live.

17:35.108 --> 17:37.509
If you give me a drink,
I will die." It's a riddle.

17:37.544 --> 17:39.852
Sumerians are credited with
creating the first riddle.

17:39.853 --> 17:41.746
The answer is fire. It's fire, right?

17:41.782 --> 17:43.315
You give it kindling, it lives.

17:43.350 --> 17:46.151
You give it water, and it dies.

17:47.621 --> 17:49.421
Stop it! You're hurting him!

17:49.456 --> 17:51.222
It's fire! The answer's fire! I swear!

17:55.228 --> 17:56.361
I don't understand.

17:56.396 --> 17:58.596
Well, now you know how I feel.

17:58.632 --> 18:01.232
You two do realize
what's going on, right?

18:01.268 --> 18:04.602
A lock I can't pick, a math
riddle you can't solve,

18:04.638 --> 18:06.771
and a pictograph you can't decipher?

18:06.807 --> 18:10.608
Looks like artifacts aren't
the only thing DOSA's studied.

18:10.644 --> 18:12.444
They studied us.

18:12.479 --> 18:14.746
They took our skills into
account to engineer this thing.

18:14.781 --> 18:19.217
This box, it's Librarian-proof.

18:24.157 --> 18:26.458
Man: Ceramic vessel? I got it.

18:26.493 --> 18:28.626
It was just behind the other one.

18:28.662 --> 18:30.862
- That's why I didn't see it.
- Serial numbers match up?

18:30.886 --> 18:32.630
Just check the inventory.
I think it is...

18:32.666 --> 18:36.201
217... what?

18:36.236 --> 18:39.137
- Get it! Grab it!
- I can't! Get it!

18:39.172 --> 18:40.638
Come on! It's too fast.

18:40.674 --> 18:42.674
Jump up there! Come on!

18:42.709 --> 18:43.908
This doesn't make any sense.

18:43.944 --> 18:46.311
Face it, DOSA's outsmarted us.

18:46.346 --> 18:47.812
There has to be another way.

18:47.848 --> 18:49.447
Come on, Cassandra. Think, think.

18:49.483 --> 18:51.283
Maybe I should try
entering the numbers again.

18:51.307 --> 18:53.251
Both: No!

18:53.286 --> 18:55.620
We don't know how much
more the poor guy can take.

18:58.358 --> 19:00.725
Bested by the Serpent Brotherhood?
I could take that.

19:00.761 --> 19:03.294
Prospero? At least he was magical.

19:03.330 --> 19:05.663
But DOSA? The government?

19:05.699 --> 19:07.465
We're smarter than
the freaking government.

19:07.501 --> 19:11.202
Yes, we are, and they know that.

19:11.238 --> 19:13.505
- What are you getting at?
- Think about it.

19:13.540 --> 19:15.673
We're all experts in our field.

19:15.709 --> 19:16.908
That goes without saying.

19:16.943 --> 19:18.410
You really think DOSA found someone

19:18.445 --> 19:20.345
smarter than us to build that thing?

19:20.380 --> 19:22.480
Well, obviously they did,
because we can't get in.

19:22.516 --> 19:24.349
No, we can't,

19:24.384 --> 19:26.684
but it's not because they're too smart.

19:26.720 --> 19:28.319
It's because we are.

19:28.355 --> 19:31.189
DOSA was counting on us
being Librarians.

19:31.224 --> 19:32.465
They knew there wasn't a puzzle

19:32.466 --> 19:34.346
that they could throw at us
that we can't solve.

19:34.370 --> 19:36.227
They knew we'd outsmart ourselves.

19:36.263 --> 19:38.530
That's right. They bet against us.

19:38.565 --> 19:41.766
So, what? We have to be dumb?

19:41.802 --> 19:43.535
Exactly.

19:43.570 --> 19:46.371
You see, if the right answer
to the puzzle is wrong...

19:46.406 --> 19:48.406
Then the wrong answer has to be right.

19:48.442 --> 19:50.708
And not just any wrong answer, okay?

19:50.744 --> 19:53.478
It has to be the exact
opposite of the right answer.

19:53.513 --> 19:55.547
So let's be dumb smartly.

19:55.582 --> 19:57.549
Come on.

19:57.584 --> 20:00.385
Okay, so the opposite of
the highest Mersenne prime

20:00.420 --> 20:02.287
is the lowest. Three.

20:04.391 --> 20:05.523
It's working.

20:06.626 --> 20:09.894
Opposite of fire...

20:09.930 --> 20:12.230
Okay, so the opposite
of the most complicated

20:12.265 --> 20:16.734
password in the world
is the dumbest password.

20:17.938 --> 20:21.573
Oh, well, finally.

20:21.608 --> 20:24.242
How many Librarians does it take
to get Jenkins out of a box?

20:24.277 --> 20:26.611
- We had some complications.
- Yeah, we had to be dumb.

20:26.646 --> 20:28.947
Oh, yes, well I'm sure
that was very difficult.

20:28.982 --> 20:30.615
Flynn sent us.
He's still at the library.

20:30.650 --> 20:32.890
He said you could protect it
by initiating the fail-safe.

20:32.914 --> 20:34.435
What? I don't know the fail-safe code.

20:34.470 --> 20:36.390
Only Charlene and Judson
know the fail-safe code.

20:36.414 --> 20:38.323
Why would Flynn say I knew that?

20:38.358 --> 20:40.291
Bring it down easy.

20:41.962 --> 20:44.963
Watch the guidelines on it.
Keep 'em taut.

20:48.635 --> 20:50.435
All right, good. You're down.

20:50.470 --> 20:52.470
It's been under
our control since Egypt.

20:56.977 --> 20:58.610
Nothing has gotten near it.

20:58.645 --> 21:00.645
- Open it.
- Mm-hmm.

21:04.985 --> 21:08.620
Argon shield with infrared
sensors and decibel detection.

21:08.655 --> 21:11.389
It can pick out even the
slightest bit of disturbance.

21:11.424 --> 21:14.292
Homeland Security
doesn't even have this yet.

21:14.327 --> 21:16.494
If only you had the Opal of Nefertiti.

21:16.530 --> 21:19.664
- What?
- Protection artifact.

21:19.699 --> 21:23.801
Creates a magical force field
that wards off Egyptian spirits.

21:23.837 --> 21:27.972
It's what we... I mean, they
would use at the Library.

21:28.008 --> 21:30.308
Colonel Baird, I assure
you there is nothing

21:30.343 --> 21:32.644
that can get past these sensors.

21:32.679 --> 21:35.346
It's been tested against
all known forms of...

21:35.382 --> 21:39.817
All known forms.

21:39.853 --> 21:42.020
I'm sorry. I'm sure I'm
worrying for no reason.

21:42.055 --> 21:43.821
Obviously, your team
has done their homework.

21:43.857 --> 21:46.424
Should we finish up
back at the Library?

21:47.816 --> 21:49.861
I'll catch up with you.

23:07.581 --> 23:10.349
It's certainly been a long journey
for you and me, hasn't it?

23:14.755 --> 23:18.057
I guess it's time to say good-bye.

23:18.092 --> 23:19.591
So, good-bye.

23:25.099 --> 23:27.800
I knew it. I knew it, I knew it.

23:27.835 --> 23:30.069
I knew you would try
to talk me out of it.

23:30.104 --> 23:32.571
Well, you can't. I'm doing it.

23:32.606 --> 23:35.074
You're not gonna change my mind.

23:35.109 --> 23:36.961
Charlene: We don't want
to change your mind.

23:36.962 --> 23:38.577
Charlene?

23:38.612 --> 23:40.746
Told you we'd see
each other again soon.

23:42.783 --> 23:44.750
So, you know what's gonna happen?

23:44.785 --> 23:47.586
Oh, please. On this side of the mirror,

23:47.621 --> 23:50.756
we get the scoop on everything.

23:50.791 --> 23:52.324
So what are you gonna do, Librarian?

23:59.467 --> 24:03.102
I'm gonna do what I'm supposed to do.

24:03.137 --> 24:06.271
The life I take has to be my own.

24:06.307 --> 24:07.840
You know that as well as I do.

24:07.875 --> 24:10.509
Yes, but I just wanted
to hear you say it.

24:13.247 --> 24:14.813
They'll be here any minute now.

24:22.857 --> 24:26.291
Man: Mark that aisle as clear!

24:26.327 --> 24:28.260
- Easy.
- Careful!

24:28.295 --> 24:31.130
One wrong note, you'll send
us back to the Stone Age.

24:31.165 --> 24:35.534
What are you...
General, what are you doing?

24:35.569 --> 24:36.835
Where do you want this set up?

24:36.871 --> 24:38.192
At the building's fracture point,

24:38.216 --> 24:39.569
which I will find soon enough.

24:43.811 --> 24:46.879
Detonating the Library
was not part of the deal.

24:46.914 --> 24:50.482
The deal has changed.

24:50.518 --> 24:51.884
Apep.

24:54.289 --> 24:56.455
You know how long I've been
waiting for this moment?

24:56.490 --> 24:58.724
To unleash pure evil?

24:58.759 --> 25:00.492
And the sweet irony that I will do it

25:00.528 --> 25:02.261
in the place that was
built to contain it.

25:02.296 --> 25:04.830
The death of the Library
will be the rebirth

25:04.865 --> 25:07.699
of pure evil and you gave it to me

25:07.735 --> 25:10.869
on a silver platter.

25:14.742 --> 25:16.975
Uh...

25:29.990 --> 25:32.724
- This way.
- Let's move.

26:53.474 --> 26:56.308
Apep: Bring me the bomb.

27:03.317 --> 27:04.783
Oh, thank you, Mr. Jones.

27:04.818 --> 27:06.961
I had no idea there was
a back door to the Library.

27:06.962 --> 27:09.010
Yeah, inside that air shaft.
Nothing's impenetrable.

27:09.011 --> 27:10.789
Jake: Today's just full of surprises.

27:10.824 --> 27:13.292
- What? Baird!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

27:13.327 --> 27:15.066
I can explain!

27:15.316 --> 27:17.196
- Jenkins, let her go!
- Give me one good reason

27:17.220 --> 27:19.298
I should not squeeze the
life out of her right now.

27:19.333 --> 27:22.301
Flynn and I... working together.

27:22.336 --> 27:24.369
We're a whole part of a plan.

27:28.575 --> 27:30.876
- Talk.
- I didn't betray you.

27:30.911 --> 27:32.811
There's no time to
get into details now,

27:32.846 --> 27:34.313
but Flynn and I planned all of this

27:34.348 --> 27:36.648
to get Apep here in the library.

27:36.684 --> 27:38.684
- You tricked us.
- How can we trust you?

27:38.719 --> 27:40.652
Flynn sent you to get Jenkins, right?

27:40.688 --> 27:42.321
To initiate the fail-safe?

27:42.356 --> 27:44.823
- Well, how'd you know that?
- It's part of the plan.

27:44.858 --> 27:47.326
Guys, Apep is already here.

27:47.361 --> 27:50.329
In the Library! We trapped him.

27:50.364 --> 27:52.831
Flynn is gonna use the
Eye of Ra to defeat Apep

27:52.866 --> 27:54.666
and lock up pure evil once and for all.

27:54.702 --> 27:57.336
It worked. Everything's gonna be fine.

27:57.371 --> 27:59.838
No, Colonel, it's not.

27:59.873 --> 28:02.341
Because Mr. Carsen failed to tell
you how the Eye of Ra works.

28:02.376 --> 28:05.610
It requires a human sacrifice.

28:11.051 --> 28:13.051
- Flynn?
- Oh, my God.

28:13.087 --> 28:15.387
He's going to sacrifice himself.

28:31.261 --> 28:32.560
Flynn's gonna kill himself?

28:32.596 --> 28:34.095
No, Jenkins. We have to stop him!

28:34.131 --> 28:36.002
- Where could he be?
- You mean you don't know?

28:36.003 --> 28:37.084
It wasn't part of the plan.

28:37.085 --> 28:38.645
I was just supposed to bring Apep here.

28:38.669 --> 28:41.736
'Cause he knew you'd try to stop him.
We all would've.

28:41.772 --> 28:43.972
- The catacombs!
- Is there a portal in here, too?

28:44.007 --> 28:45.907
No, the Library itself is the portal.

28:45.943 --> 28:48.643
If the catacombs gets fractured,
pure evil could be released.

28:48.679 --> 28:50.612
- Final check complete.
- Ready to arm.

28:50.647 --> 28:53.248
Arming now.

28:53.283 --> 28:55.617
Voice: Detonate in 30 seconds.

28:57.788 --> 28:59.921
- Leave now.
- Yes, General.

28:59.957 --> 29:02.991
- Ezekiel: Come on! Let's go!
- Jake: We got company.

29:03.026 --> 29:04.926
Move, move, move, move, move!

29:04.962 --> 29:06.761
Where are they going?

29:06.797 --> 29:07.929
There's a bomb!

29:07.965 --> 29:14.102
14, 13, 12, 11, 10,

29:14.137 --> 29:20.108
nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,

29:20.143 --> 29:23.211
three, two, one.

29:28.385 --> 29:29.851
Get down!

29:33.790 --> 29:35.824
Jenkins: Watch it!

29:42.332 --> 29:44.632
- Everybody all right?
- Mm-hmm.

29:44.668 --> 29:45.800
Help me move this stuff out.

29:45.836 --> 29:47.335
We've gotta get to Flynn.

30:35.085 --> 30:38.153
I can hear Apep. Hurry, come on!

30:38.188 --> 30:39.506
Jenkins: All right, all right.

30:39.507 --> 30:41.689
Cassandra: Go, go, go.

30:41.725 --> 30:45.360
- Cassandra: Baird!
- Jenkins: Colonel!

30:45.395 --> 30:46.899
Eve: Flynn! Flynn, don't do this!

30:46.900 --> 30:48.977
- Eve.
- I understand why

30:48.978 --> 30:50.458
you think you have to, but you don't.

30:50.482 --> 30:51.514
There's no other way.

30:51.549 --> 30:53.482
Then we'll find one together.

30:53.518 --> 30:57.420
If there were another way,
believe me, I would do it.

30:57.455 --> 31:01.023
There isn't. You have to let me go.

31:01.059 --> 31:04.327
You promised you wouldn't leave.
Please, Flynn.

31:04.362 --> 31:06.962
I'm on borrowed time already.

31:06.998 --> 31:08.923
I've been a Librarian
longer than anybody else.

31:10.300 --> 31:11.534
Please, Flynn.

31:13.671 --> 31:18.140
I should feel scared
right now, but I don't.

31:18.176 --> 31:22.011
I feel grateful... to you.

31:24.182 --> 31:27.149
And to the Library...

31:27.185 --> 31:28.684
for bringing me so much joy.

31:31.522 --> 31:33.055
Good-bye, Eve.

31:33.091 --> 31:36.559
No! I won't let you!

31:41.666 --> 31:47.002
I love you... always and forever.

31:47.038 --> 31:49.205
Please!

31:59.150 --> 32:01.350
Flynn!

32:01.386 --> 32:03.686
- Whoa. You see that?
- Yeah, what is it?

32:19.070 --> 32:21.070
So this is what you look like, huh?

32:22.240 --> 32:25.040
Pictured you taller. More muscles.

32:25.076 --> 32:27.109
Librarian.

32:27.145 --> 32:29.545
Psycho look in the
eyes is right, though.

32:29.580 --> 32:31.547
You have come here to stop me.

32:31.582 --> 32:34.183
It is too late. You have failed.

32:34.218 --> 32:37.553
I don't think so.

32:37.588 --> 32:39.388
You humans amuse me,

32:39.424 --> 32:43.559
clinging to your pathetic
notions of "good conquers evil".

32:43.594 --> 32:45.227
Look around you.

32:45.263 --> 32:49.398
The world is rife with war
and hate and destruction.

32:49.434 --> 32:52.301
Good is an aberration.

32:52.336 --> 32:56.806
I'm only restoring the
world to its natural state.

32:56.841 --> 32:58.441
You finished with
your little soliloquy?

32:58.476 --> 33:01.744
Because I'm tired
and I want to end this

33:01.779 --> 33:04.613
and send you back to whatever
hole you crawled out of.

33:11.556 --> 33:12.621
No!

33:24.541 --> 33:26.041
We're too late.

33:29.680 --> 33:32.881
Where am I? What happened?

33:35.385 --> 33:38.853
- What is that?
- I'm gonna get her to safety. General!

33:38.889 --> 33:43.358
You're gonna help me after
what we've done to you?

33:43.393 --> 33:46.494
It's what we do.

33:48.498 --> 33:50.732
There's gotta be another way.

33:50.767 --> 33:53.034
I don't think there is another way.

33:53.070 --> 33:54.869
I don't accept that.

33:54.905 --> 33:58.039
No! You're Librarians.

33:58.075 --> 33:59.941
You're the smartest
people in the world.

33:59.977 --> 34:04.112
Prove it! Now!

34:06.416 --> 34:09.583
The gift of inner soul.

34:11.021 --> 34:13.088
I think I might have an idea.

34:15.425 --> 34:18.560
It involves magic. Don't ask.

34:18.594 --> 34:20.628
Baird, can you get us across that gap?

34:20.664 --> 34:22.597
Come on.

34:33.944 --> 34:36.911
Is that the best you got?

34:36.947 --> 34:38.580
A little gust of hot air?

34:38.614 --> 34:40.081
Think you need some new moves.

34:40.117 --> 34:42.083
Fool! You cannot stop me.

34:42.119 --> 34:44.418
Stop you? Yes, I've heard that before.

34:44.454 --> 34:45.754
That's your problem, Apep.

34:45.789 --> 34:48.757
You've always underestimated me.

34:48.792 --> 34:52.092
You remember what I told
you when we first met?

34:52.129 --> 34:54.596
That I would do anything
for the Librarians,

34:54.630 --> 34:55.897
even die for them?

34:59.136 --> 35:00.869
I wasn't bluffing.

35:03.140 --> 35:04.839
The Eye of Ra.

35:11.114 --> 35:13.815
No! No!

35:32.502 --> 35:33.835
Okay, put it down.

35:35.272 --> 35:38.039
- All right, get ready.
- Go.

35:41.711 --> 35:43.478
Apep: No! No!

35:43.513 --> 35:44.913
It's almost over. It's almost over.

35:44.937 --> 35:46.848
No, we've found another way.

35:46.883 --> 35:48.049
There's no other way!

35:48.085 --> 35:49.684
There's always another way.

35:49.719 --> 35:51.986
No!

35:52.022 --> 35:55.123
The Monkey King said I could
bestow the gift of inner soul.

36:01.531 --> 36:02.831
I'm giving it to you.

36:04.968 --> 36:08.169
I have the ability
to transport thought.

36:08.205 --> 36:10.772
I give you the power of thought.

36:18.882 --> 36:21.182
No one needs this love
potion more than you.

36:21.218 --> 36:23.885
Here, have a heart!

36:30.894 --> 36:33.228
Clever, Librarians.

36:43.073 --> 36:45.974
What is happening to me?

36:46.009 --> 36:49.177
To work the Eye of Ra
requires a human sacrifice,

36:49.212 --> 36:51.946
so my friends found
another human to sacrifice.

36:51.982 --> 36:55.550
- Me.
- Welcome to the human race.

36:55.585 --> 36:57.085
No, no!

36:57.120 --> 36:59.087
No!

37:10.167 --> 37:12.167
The ley lines are receding.

37:12.202 --> 37:13.968
Flynn: Pure evil was
leeching off of them.

37:14.004 --> 37:16.237
Now that the pure evil's
going, so are they.

37:29.787 --> 37:32.020
You know, you guys could've
thought of that a lot sooner

37:32.055 --> 37:33.788
and saved me a lot of trouble.

37:45.135 --> 37:47.268
Ezekiel: You have some
serious explaining to do.

37:47.304 --> 37:49.103
How could you lie to us?

37:49.139 --> 37:51.639
You should've told us the plan.
We could've helped.

37:51.675 --> 37:53.675
Well, that's exactly what
we didn't want you to do.

37:53.710 --> 37:55.777
You were our fail-safe.

37:55.812 --> 37:57.979
If we failed and
pure evil was released,

37:58.014 --> 37:59.347
we'd need you guys as back up.

37:59.382 --> 38:02.617
And you working for DOSA?

38:02.652 --> 38:04.619
We knew the only place to battle Apep

38:04.654 --> 38:06.294
and make sure pure evil
was sealed up once

38:06.318 --> 38:07.956
and for all would be
inside the Library.

38:07.991 --> 38:10.124
But battling would mean
that countless artifacts

38:10.160 --> 38:12.627
- could've been destroyed...
- So you needed a safe place

38:12.662 --> 38:14.796
to protect the artifacts
until it was all over.

38:14.831 --> 38:17.632
A facility whose security
features rivaled our own.

38:17.667 --> 38:19.701
Like one that DOSA had
been building all along.

38:21.137 --> 38:23.638
Clever.

38:23.673 --> 38:27.141
You intentionally set me up
to be possessed by Apep.

38:27.177 --> 38:29.811
- He could've killed me.
- Yeah, but he didn't.

38:29.846 --> 38:31.367
I think you should focus on that part.

38:31.391 --> 38:33.648
I'm sorry. We had no choice.

38:33.683 --> 38:36.651
Very well, then. You forgot
one important thing.

38:36.686 --> 38:40.255
I now have possession of nearly
all the Library's artifacts.

38:40.290 --> 38:43.157
You don't expect me to just
hand them over, do you?

38:43.193 --> 38:45.993
You really think after what you've
seen today, they're safest with you?

38:46.028 --> 38:48.708
I'm sure you'll do a great job taking
care of the Loch Ness Monster.

38:48.732 --> 38:51.299
And no one will accidentally
open up Pandora's Box.

38:51.334 --> 38:54.402
- Nor touch Midas' hand.
- We are not fools.

38:54.437 --> 38:56.170
We're trained to deal
with anything that...

38:56.206 --> 38:58.172
Or open an Egyptian god's sarcophagus

38:58.208 --> 39:00.041
and end up becoming possessed.

39:02.145 --> 39:04.178
It's your decision to make.

39:04.214 --> 39:06.814
Whatever you decide, we'll respect.

39:15.191 --> 39:18.198
And with that, the Library's
collection is restored.

39:18.340 --> 39:21.362
I noticed you moved a number of artifacts
around from where they used to be.

39:21.398 --> 39:23.197
Yes, yes. I thought it would be helpful

39:23.233 --> 39:26.267
to have a few artifacts
close at hand just in case.

39:26.303 --> 39:28.202
Eve: In case what?

39:28.238 --> 39:31.039
In case any of our Librarians
decide to use magic again.

39:31.074 --> 39:33.154
I don't think that's gonna be
happening anytime soon.

39:33.178 --> 39:34.876
What do you mean?

39:34.911 --> 39:38.880
We've decided not to use
magic or the artifacts.

39:38.915 --> 39:40.882
Or any of our newfound abilities,

39:40.917 --> 39:42.317
like my enhanced gift.

39:42.352 --> 39:44.452
Or what I've learned
from the Monkey King.

39:44.487 --> 39:47.455
Just because you can,
doesn't mean you should.

39:47.490 --> 39:51.726
And you're all in agreement with this?

39:51.761 --> 39:54.228
A wise guardian once
reminded me that the Library

39:54.264 --> 39:56.831
didn't choose us for
our ability to do magic,

39:56.866 --> 39:59.934
but for our ability to know
when to use it and when not to.

39:59.969 --> 40:03.771
So we will use magic,
but only as a last resort.

40:03.807 --> 40:07.041
It's way safer kept in here
where magic belongs.

40:07.077 --> 40:08.810
Flynn: Spoken like true Librarians.

40:08.845 --> 40:11.145
I'm reminded of one
of my early adventures.

40:11.181 --> 40:12.747
It was on the Serengeti,

40:12.782 --> 40:14.415
tracking a particularly pesky artifact.

40:14.451 --> 40:16.884
Oh! Ooh!

40:16.920 --> 40:19.921
Streaming service plagued
by visions from the future.

40:19.956 --> 40:22.256
- It's gotta be a hack.
- Or a tech-savvy spirit.

40:22.292 --> 40:24.292
- Or a virtual wormhole.
- I'll check the dark web.

40:24.316 --> 40:25.960
I'm on Einstein-Rosen bridges.

40:25.995 --> 40:29.097
- I've got Nostradamus.
- I'll make tea.

40:29.132 --> 40:32.100
So, I guess this is the
part where I apologize

40:32.135 --> 40:34.789
for keeping you in the dark and
promise to never do it again?

40:34.971 --> 40:37.566
Actually, no.

40:38.308 --> 40:41.442
You're Flynn Carsen,
who spent years working alone

40:41.478 --> 40:45.279
and will spend years adjusting
to working with others.

40:45.315 --> 40:48.449
- It's just who you are.
- You're okay with that?

40:48.485 --> 40:52.787
No, but you're trying,
and that's all I can ask.

40:52.822 --> 40:55.289
So you're suggesting
that we just accept

40:55.325 --> 40:58.126
each other for who we are,
faults and all.

40:58.161 --> 41:01.796
Yes, but you're lucky,

41:01.831 --> 41:03.965
because I don't really have any faults.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.800
Flynn: You know, that's true.

41:05.835 --> 41:07.802
See? You're learning already.

41:07.837 --> 41:12.140
Oh, it's nice to have
everything back to normal.

41:12.175 --> 41:14.175
It certainly is.
