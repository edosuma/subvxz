the one time I wasn't prepared:

10:28.303 --> 10:30.470
There is no pass.
Only fail.

10:30.553 --> 10:31.887
Since this was
the first class,

10:31.970 --> 10:33.220

10:33.303 --> 10:35.387
No, no.
You have one chance.

not prepared with a brief

10:38.011 --> 10:39.428

Not to be shamed.

10:52.011 --> 10:53.387
Oh, I hardly think
I shamed--

10:53.470 --> 10:55.929
We don't learn best
under this kind of pressure.

17:28.053 --> 17:29.970

are getting longer,

of your artistic value,

18:13.261 --> 18:14.428

I-I don't even--

18:20.303 --> 18:22.220
I don't even think about it.
I force myself not to.

And all I can think about now
is his reaction to my work.

18:25.720 --> 18:28.845
That's because someone,
at some time,

18:28.929 --> 18:31.345

18:31.428 --> 18:33.428

41:48.345 --> 41:50.011
In neighborhoods
like this one.

41:50.095 --> 41:52.095
As I have done with
my partners...

41:52.178 --> 41:54.595
[Prince] In Chicago,
Detroit, Atlanta.

41:54.679 --> 41:57.637
We don't just build the housing
and the businesses.

41:57.720 --> 41:59.970
We don't just build the fields
and the courts.

42:00.053 --> 42:02.637
We establish the leagues
and the programs

42:02.720 --> 42:05.303
that keep the kids
off the streets and playing.

42:05.387 --> 42:07.053
Give the man
a civilian medal.

42:07.136 --> 42:09.387
Mm. And I could use
an insulin pump. Stat.

42:09.470 --> 42:10.720
Or a barf bag.

42:15.804 --> 42:18.470
Our results and successes
speak for themselves.

42:18.553 --> 42:20.637
And before I wrap up,
it's incumbent upon me

42:20.720 --> 42:24.512
to sound a cautionary note about
certain of my colleagues here.

42:24.595 --> 42:27.261
To make sure this project
is executed as intended.

42:27.345 --> 42:28.970
I have brought
a special guest...

42:35.303 --> 42:36.595
[door closes]

42:37.679 --> 42:39.804
Meet Marc Capparello.

42:39.887 --> 42:42.553
[Prince] He's a former
town councilman from Sandicot.

42:42.637 --> 42:45.553
Where Robert Axelrod made
similar financial inroads

42:45.637 --> 42:46.762
into the community.

42:46.845 --> 42:48.220
How did that
work out, Marc?

42:48.303 --> 42:50.553
Honestly?
Not too well.

42:50.637 --> 42:53.178
[Marc] There was a lot of
rosy talk about the future

42:53.261 --> 42:54.887
and promises were made.

42:54.970 --> 42:57.387
Only for our town's financing
to be ripped away

42:57.470 --> 42:59.512
like one of those wax jobs
in a beauty salon.

42:59.595 --> 43:02.345
[Marc] Hmm?
It really stung.

43:02.428 --> 43:04.512
And our town
will be recovering--

43:04.595 --> 43:07.011
trying to grow its hair back,
if you will--

43:07.095 --> 43:09.512
for generations to come.

43:09.595 --> 43:12.679
I'm sorry.

43:12.762 --> 43:14.053
Thank you.

43:14.136 --> 43:15.762
[spectators murmuring]

43:17.387 --> 43:20.095
Told you, Axelrod: I hate it
when people mess with my money.

43:20.178 --> 43:22.720
[Bledsoe] Mr. Axelrod,
you have the floor.

43:25.595 --> 43:29.887
Let me tell you what went wrong
in Sandicot.

43:29.970 --> 43:33.929
It's true I made
a big investment there...

43:34.011 --> 43:39.011
and we all had high hopes for
the future...until this man--

43:39.095 --> 43:41.428
No, no! You're a sore
goddamned loser--

43:41.512 --> 43:43.553
Decided to pull
his casino,

43:43.637 --> 43:45.637
for no reason other than
his own greed,

43:45.720 --> 43:48.345
and moved it to land
he held elsewhere.

43:48.428 --> 43:51.845
He left us all
holding the bag.

43:51.929 --> 43:54.553
Now, efforts
are still being made.

43:54.637 --> 43:57.303
But that callous style
of development

43:57.387 --> 43:59.178
is one of the real drivers
for me here...

43:59.261 --> 44:02.637
Because this is different.

44:02.720 --> 44:03.679
This is home...

44:03.762 --> 44:06.053

of bullshit.

we have to do this

You know, we had fake IDs,
but they never asked for 'em.

45:05.136 --> 45:07.136
[Axe] I learned plenty
in there.

45:07.220 --> 45:09.011
Like if an old guy
offers you odds

45:09.095 --> 45:11.136

Used to take dates down there

45:19.720 --> 45:22.303
Yeah, right. Our pal Freddie
used to work there as an usher,

45:22.387 --> 45:24.845
would always open up the
back door and let us sneak in.

45:24.929 --> 45:26.303
Yeah. And then
of course, afterwards,

45:26.387 --> 45:27.470
we'd head over
to see Bruno...

45:27.553 --> 45:29.136
-Yeah.
-..down at Capparello's.

That's right.

45:40.011 --> 45:41.929
Look, I'll tell ya, I--

45:44.762 --> 45:49.011
I'm not an
overly emotional guy,

45:49.095 --> 45:52.679
but I could do this for
every single store in the town,

45:52.762 --> 45:55.345
and all the houses
too, probably.

45:55.428 --> 45:56.845
[Axe] Just as
this man could...

45:56.929 --> 45:58.095
[Axe] Come here.

46:00.679 --> 46:02.762
Savion Williams.

46:03.970 --> 46:07.303
This is very moving, but
this board has one concern:

46:07.387 --> 46:08.762
that you're a leaver.

46:08.845 --> 46:09.970
[Bledsoe] That you won't
stay the course.

46:10.053 --> 46:12.804
No. No.
Like Savion, I was born here.

46:12.887 --> 46:14.970
This was my childhood.

46:15.053 --> 46:18.303
You know the house he
lives in now was my house.

46:18.387 --> 46:21.345
But this whole town
is my home.

46:21.428 --> 46:25.261
And, yes, sure,
I left for a while,

46:25.345 --> 46:27.095
but I'm back.

46:27.178 --> 46:30.387
And the thought of anyone else
helping to rebuild this place.

46:30.470 --> 46:33.220
Well, it just
feels wrong.

46:33.303 --> 46:34.512
They wouldn't
understand.

46:34.595 --> 46:36.470
[Axe] Though
rebuild it we must,

46:36.553 --> 46:40.929
not for nostalgia,
but for the future.

46:41.011 --> 46:43.553
For Savion's future.

46:43.637 --> 46:46.095
[Bledsoe] Wow.
Thanks, Bobby.

46:46.178 --> 46:47.929

I appreciate your time.

[knock on door, door opens]

47:03.553 --> 47:04.762
[chuckles]

47:04.845 --> 47:07.053
Heard how it all
went up there,

47:07.136 --> 47:09.595
that you got a taste of
the old Bobby Axelrod boogie.

47:09.679 --> 47:11.512
-I've seen worse.
-[Chuck] Ah.

47:11.595 --> 47:13.011

47:13.095 --> 47:14.970
Yeah. I'll bet.

47:15.053 --> 47:16.762
But you're gonna
lose the O.Z.

47:16.845 --> 47:18.387
unless you play
a little ball now.

47:18.470 --> 47:20.095
I came here
to tell you:

47:20.178 --> 47:23.804
I've already felt too much pull
to my old ways.

47:23.887 --> 47:26.345
[Prince] I've fought
to not be that person.

47:26.428 --> 47:28.303
Escaping it once
was hard enough.

47:28.387 --> 47:29.595
I can't give in to it now.

47:29.679 --> 47:34.136
Yeah, Axe took out
his lute

47:34.220 --> 47:37.679
and played 'em a hypnotic
old folk ballad.

47:37.762 --> 47:39.136
[Prince]
He probably won it.

47:39.220 --> 47:41.011
-Mm.
-[Prince] Sucks. It does.

47:41.095 --> 47:44.762
But heck, I'm still rich enough
for twenty lifetimes.

47:44.845 --> 47:48.804
That's not how you became
who you are, by giving up.

47:48.887 --> 47:50.929
The problem is
the feeling you get--

47:51.011 --> 47:54.136
and I know you get it, too--when
you engage in a fight like this,

47:54.220 --> 47:56.261
in the way that
you're proposing.

47:56.345 --> 47:57.637
It feels good.

47:57.720 --> 47:59.679
Nope. That's a lie.

47:59.762 --> 48:02.095

you further,

48:10.929 --> 48:12.178
darker.

48:12.261 --> 48:13.553
Mm.

48:16.762 --> 48:20.053
I had a game,
senior year,

48:20.136 --> 48:22.762
I put up sixty points.

48:22.845 --> 48:25.136
The cheering
with each bucket.

48:25.220 --> 48:28.053

could stop me.

a giant afterwards.

48:32.762 --> 48:34.637
Couldn't sleep
for two days.

48:34.720 --> 48:39.053
And when I came down, I saw
how I had alienated myself

48:39.136 --> 48:40.845
from my teammates
and my family.

48:40.929 --> 48:43.679
[Prince] I had forgotten
they existed.

48:43.762 --> 48:47.637

and got mine.

48:47.720 --> 48:49.136

in business.

48:49.220 --> 48:51.720

for good.

turn me back into...

in his words, a monster.

49:03.887 --> 49:07.637

when you scored the sixty?

49:07.720 --> 49:09.470
Yah. Bet you did.

49:09.553 --> 49:11.512
So do it again.

We are trying to stop you from
the same fate the whalers had.

Back in the mid-1800s,
whaling was like Facebook.

50:11.387 --> 50:14.095
Blubber was the oil that
lighted the Western world.

50:14.178 --> 50:16.220
But by the second half
of that century,

50:16.303 --> 50:17.679
whale oil was replaced
by kerosene.

50:17.762 --> 50:19.387
Whaling became MySpace.

50:19.470 --> 50:21.970
And then kerosene collapsed with
the invention of electricity.

Why do you think he gave
this insane speech?

51:44.136 --> 51:46.136
What do you think
he was trying to do?

51:49.804 --> 51:50.887
Oh come on!

This part won't be

I know you're all full
of lots of opinions,

51:54.303 --> 51:56.220
you're just waiting for someone
to break the ice.

51:56.303 --> 51:59.595
I see it as the ultimate act
of humiliation.

51:59.679 --> 52:01.136
Sounds like you're
getting Freudian on me.

52:01.220 --> 52:03.178
-Elaborate.
-Yeah, exactly--

52:03.261 --> 52:05.762
it's classic masochism
death drive stuff.

52:05.845 --> 52:08.178
[Narit] Rhoades was ready to
sacrifice his political career,

52:08.261 --> 52:09.720
but only on his own terms.

52:09.804 --> 52:12.720
But he did it
to win an election.

52:12.804 --> 52:15.053
He's a cis white man
running for office.

52:15.136 --> 52:16.261
[Kara] He's in
a privileged position

52:16.345 --> 52:17.887

his own narrative.

52:17.970 --> 52:19.387
[chuckles] I'm
honestly surprised

52:19.470 --> 52:22.512
it took one of you so long
to mention privilege.

52:22.595 --> 52:24.553
This might be
a new record.

52:24.637 --> 52:26.261
But I agree with you.

52:26.345 --> 52:28.637
Is the speech
subversive at all?

52:28.720 --> 52:30.261
Not really, no.

52:30.345 --> 52:32.929
[Cat] So maybe that's exactly
what masochism is.

52:33.011 --> 52:35.136
It's the pursuit of autonomy in

52:35.220 --> 52:37.679
and the control over pain
and suffering.

52:37.762 --> 52:42.512
Rhoades played subservient
in order to win dominance.

52:43.720 --> 52:47.804
But why don't we
ask Rhoades himself?

52:47.887 --> 52:50.679
Chuck, get on up here.

53:02.845 --> 53:05.261
did you receive
any gratification...

53:05.345 --> 53:09.303
what I mean is--did you get off
on giving this speech?

53:09.387 --> 53:11.970
Uh...
