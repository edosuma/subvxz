00:06.007 --> 00:07.122
[BO narrating]
Last time on Lost Girl:

00:07.341 --> 00:08.751
Which brings us back to Daddy...

00:08.968 --> 00:10.458
[ZEE]
We have to stop him first.

00:10.678 --> 00:11.963
[BO] Stop him from what?

00:12.180 --> 00:13.966
[ZEE] From using you
to end the world.

00:14.182 --> 00:15.797
[MARK] It was you who
killed all those people.

00:16.017 --> 00:17.882
[IRIS] They had to
go to sleep, Mark.

00:18.102 --> 00:19.967
[TAMSIN gasps]

00:20.188 --> 00:22.554
[TRICK] The Nyx, a
primordial force of evil.

00:22.773 --> 00:23.728
[30}
How do we fight it?

00:23.941 --> 00:25.647
[TRICK] A toy box,
made of adamantine.

00:25.860 --> 00:27.976
[BO] Well maybe it
takes evil to fight evil.

00:28.196 --> 00:29.026
[ZEE] You open that box,

00:29.238 --> 00:30.614
and your father
will walk the Earth.

00:30.823 --> 00:33.781
[HADES] Our power will
decide the fate of this world.

00:33.993 --> 00:36.530
The answer lies with you.

00:37.288 --> 00:38.824
The answer's in a gift.

00:39.040 --> 00:39.495
[ZEE] No.

00:39.707 --> 00:40.696
[ZEE knocking on door]

00:40.917 --> 00:42.282
No!

00:42.501 --> 00:45.288
Bo, you think...
Oh, you think you're special?!

00:45.504 --> 00:47.165
You think you're strong?!

00:47.381 --> 00:51.374
Everything you have
it's because of him.

00:51.594 --> 00:54.961
Well maybe it
takes evil to fight evil.

00:55.181 --> 00:57.547
[ZEE] You don't know
what you're doing.

00:57.767 --> 01:07.608
[music box playing]

01:07.818 --> 01:17.819
[music box continues]

01:32.301 --> 01:33.837
Dad?

01:35.012 --> 01:36.968
[knock on door]

01:38.474 --> 01:40.010
Zee?

01:51.320 --> 01:53.311
The end is nigh.

01:53.531 --> 01:54.566
Who are you?

01:54.782 --> 01:55.817
[MAN] My name is John.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.318
Do you want to be saved?

01:57.535 --> 01:59.071
Why are you here?

01:59.287 --> 02:01.573
I'd like to invite you
to prayer circle on Sunday.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.700
The end of
the world is coming.

02:03.916 --> 02:06.999
Yeah. No kidding.

02:08.462 --> 02:09.326
[DYSON]
It's gonna be okay, Mark.

02:09.547 --> 02:11.333
It's gonna be okay.

02:12.591 --> 02:13.751
[DYSON]
Stay back. Stay back.

02:13.968 --> 02:15.629
No, he is losing
a lot of blood, Dyson.

02:15.845 --> 02:17.460
He's going
to be okay, right?

02:17.680 --> 02:18.669
If we don't get him
back to my clinic,

02:18.889 --> 02:20.299
he's going to bleed out.

02:20.516 --> 02:21.346
I'm a doctor.
What happened?

02:21.559 --> 02:22.890
He's been stabbed.

02:23.102 --> 02:24.808
My kit's in my car.
I'll be right back.

02:25.021 --> 02:26.136
You can fix this, right?
We don't need him.

02:26.355 --> 02:28.812
[LAUREN] Dyson, he has supplies.
I have nothing!

02:29.025 --> 02:31.061
[DYSON]
I said stand back.

02:31.277 --> 02:33.233
Come on, Mark.

02:34.613 --> 02:35.147
Here you go.

02:35.364 --> 02:36.820
[LAUREN] Thank you.

02:37.033 --> 02:38.739
[DOCTOR] His abdominal
aorta's been lacerated.

02:38.951 --> 02:40.111
He needs surgery fast.

02:40.328 --> 02:41.238
Thank you,
we can take it from here.

02:41.454 --> 02:42.660
We need to get him
to the clinic.

02:42.872 --> 02:44.157
[DOCTOR] He won't survive
the trip to the hospital.

02:44.373 --> 02:46.614
Dyson. He's right.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.699
Surgery can't wait.
I need him.

02:49.253 --> 02:51.039
[clears throat]

02:51.422 --> 02:54.585
Okay. What do we have here?

02:55.593 --> 02:57.629
[LAUREN] Oh god, oh god.
It's worse than I thought.

02:57.845 --> 02:58.800
No time to waste.

02:59.013 --> 03:02.380
Okay, doll. Stick it.
There we go. I got it.

03:02.600 --> 03:05.467
[DOCTOR] Ooh... Okay,
little buddy. Hang in there.

03:09.440 --> 03:10.475
With the Nyx unleashed,

03:10.691 --> 03:13.398
it could mean the end
of all existence.

03:13.611 --> 03:16.227
[TRICK] Legend states that
the Nyx's darkness will

03:16.447 --> 03:20.031
seep to the Earth's
core by midnight.

03:20.242 --> 03:23.154
It is time for the
Blood King to use his gift.

03:23.371 --> 03:26.204
Write the Nyx
out of existence.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.406
Whenever I use my blood,

03:28.626 --> 03:31.368
the outcome is much worse
than the present danger.

03:31.587 --> 03:33.828
What could be worse
than the end?

03:34.048 --> 03:35.379
Open your veins.

03:35.591 --> 03:37.297
[TRICK] My blood will
only write the future.

03:37.510 --> 03:41.719
But I'm afraid the Nyx
is the end of time itself.

03:41.931 --> 03:43.592
We must call the
rest of the Council.

03:43.808 --> 03:45.298
Pool our resources.

03:45.518 --> 03:49.761
Well, then, let me be
the first to contribute.

03:49.980 --> 03:51.265
[TRICK]
The Staff of Pestilence.

03:51.482 --> 03:55.020
[CHRISTOS] Yes. I used it
to fight the Black Death.

03:55.236 --> 03:59.605
I am confident it will
stave off this new plague.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.366
It's the Aegis Shield.

04:08.582 --> 04:09.867
Adamantine.

04:10.084 --> 04:12.575
The only metal that can
hold off the Ancients.

04:12.795 --> 04:14.205
That's only legend.

04:14.422 --> 04:15.332
Let's hope it's more.

04:15.548 --> 04:16.628
[CHRISTOS] Indeed.

04:16.841 --> 04:18.172
[running footsteps]

04:18.384 --> 04:19.920
--[|R|S] Hello?
--[TR|CK] The Nyx.

04:20.136 --> 04:21.296
Can't be...

04:21.512 --> 04:23.343
ls Mark here?

04:23.556 --> 04:25.262
Whatever happens,
do not let her touch you.

04:25.474 --> 04:29.092
I will awaken the Staff
and end this now.

04:29.311 --> 04:30.721
[clang]

04:32.231 --> 04:37.271
[speaking in Latin]

04:43.701 --> 04:45.111
She's just a girl.

04:50.833 --> 04:59.081
[music intensifies]

04:59.300 --> 05:04.294
[opening theme]

05:12.062 --> 05:15.099
He's stable, Dyson.

05:15.316 --> 05:18.149
And healing a lot
faster than expected.

05:22.448 --> 05:24.234
Lauren, thank you.

05:24.450 --> 05:25.860
You don't need to thank me.

05:26.076 --> 05:26.906
What you did was...

05:27.119 --> 05:30.486
Well, yeah. You've done
your fair share of rescuing.

05:33.417 --> 05:34.827
This is my fault.

05:35.044 --> 05:35.874
He wasn't ready.

05:36.086 --> 05:38.873
Dyson, you didn't know.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.922
[LAUREN] Let's just focus
on what we can do.

05:46.347 --> 05:48.679
Find Bo.

05:48.891 --> 05:49.880
And Tamsin.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.261
Where is Tamsin?

05:52.478 --> 05:54.389
[cell phone beeps]

05:57.983 --> 06:04.821
[cell phone buzzing]

06:05.032 --> 06:06.442
[grunting]

06:06.659 --> 06:08.615
[HERA] You're actually
pretty when you sleep.

06:08.827 --> 06:11.364
You're actually pretty
creepy when you stare.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.241
You also talk in your sleep.

06:13.457 --> 06:16.164
I considered a ball gag,
but to be honest

06:16.377 --> 06:20.746
I found your mutterings
sort of... charming.

06:20.965 --> 06:23.172
What, this isn't
S and M enough for you?

06:23.384 --> 06:24.169
[HERA] Oh, right.

06:24.385 --> 06:26.216
[clears throat]

06:26.428 --> 06:28.419
You mean, all this?

06:28.639 --> 06:30.049
Ow!

06:30.558 --> 06:33.220
No this is an
insurance policy.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.096
I thought you'd be
familiar with it.

06:35.312 --> 06:37.143
[elevator dings]

06:38.607 --> 06:40.188
[h uffs]

06:40.401 --> 06:42.858
[grunts]

06:43.070 --> 06:44.901
[HERA] Tough night?

06:46.240 --> 06:48.276
Bo released
Hades from Tartarus.

06:48.492 --> 06:49.857
Hades?

06:50.536 --> 06:52.527
Wha-What does he want?

06:53.872 --> 06:55.487
What do you
think he wants?

06:58.127 --> 06:59.663
I thought you were dead.

06:59.878 --> 07:00.628
Mm.

07:00.838 --> 07:01.953
[ZEE] Guess you have a
little more fight in you

07:02.172 --> 07:04.208
after all, huh?

07:06.302 --> 07:07.758
[chuckles]

07:07.970 --> 07:10.211
You know, I've never met a
high cheekbone I didn't like.

07:10.431 --> 07:13.343
But I gotta say that's
not a great look on you.

07:13.559 --> 07:15.595
And it won't work on me.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.308
With the Nyx unleashed,

07:20.524 --> 07:23.561
we have front row seats
to the end of the world.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.393
We'll be safe here,
as long as we have--

07:29.450 --> 07:30.940
[ZEE] Where is my shield?

07:31.160 --> 07:32.275
It was--lt was right there.

07:32.494 --> 07:33.700
Yeah--you--l--

07:33.912 --> 07:39.123
Your level of uselessness
never ceases to amaze me.

07:39.335 --> 07:40.120
[HERA]
Where are you going?

07:40.336 --> 07:41.667
[ZEE] Where do you
think I'm going?

07:41.879 --> 07:42.743
To get my shield back.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.500
'Cause it was stolen at
the party because someone

07:45.716 --> 07:47.923
[ZEE] thought it'd be a great
idea to hang it on the wall.

07:48.135 --> 07:48.999
In plain sight!

07:49.219 --> 07:49.878
You--you said--

07:50.095 --> 07:54.429
[ZEE] I said to show
our strength, you idiot.

07:54.642 --> 07:55.506
You told me to--

07:55.726 --> 07:56.260
[ZEE] I told you to what?

07:56.477 --> 07:57.592
To let someone
walk out of here

07:57.811 --> 07:59.096
with the only thing
that can protect us?

07:59.313 --> 08:01.019
[HERA] I didn't let
anyone walk out of here.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.311
[ZEE] It's a wonder
I had it at all

08:02.524 --> 08:04.981
after you practically
gave it to Athena.

08:06.111 --> 08:07.647
This again?

08:07.863 --> 08:08.852
[HERA] She was one of us.

08:09.073 --> 08:10.404
And her monumental rack
had nothing to do with it?

08:10.616 --> 08:11.776
[HERA] You said that
she could borrow it.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.277
[ZEE] Oh stop.

08:13.494 --> 08:15.610
Because the more you
try to explain yourself,

08:15.829 --> 08:18.206
the more pathetic
you sound.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.209
It's embarrassing.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.158
Guys. I'm kinda over this.

08:23.379 --> 08:24.994
My hands hurt.

08:25.214 --> 08:27.671
What do we do with her?

08:27.883 --> 08:28.747
[h uffs]

08:28.967 --> 08:30.753
Get rid of her.

08:32.805 --> 08:34.341
[ZEE] Actually...

08:47.986 --> 08:49.522
Ow! Geez!

08:49.738 --> 08:51.729
Hold on to her for a while.

08:51.949 --> 08:53.655
Hopefully she's
worthy of a trade.

09:01.959 --> 09:03.324
Hi.

09:03.544 --> 09:04.954
I was concerned
about the boy.

09:05.170 --> 09:05.955
How's he doing?

09:06.171 --> 09:08.708
He's healing
very quickly actually.

09:08.924 --> 09:10.505
Thank you, again.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.800
Glad to have been of service.

09:13.011 --> 09:16.003
When you're done, could I maybe
get back my medical bag?

09:16.223 --> 09:17.133
Yes, of course. Sorry.

09:17.349 --> 09:18.725
Uh, wait here.
I'll go get it.

09:18.934 --> 09:20.720
[DOCTOR] Sure.

09:30.696 --> 09:32.982
[DOCTOR]
May I see the patient?

09:33.198 --> 09:34.859
Um, he's asleep.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.986
Uh, you're not
supposed to be in here.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.783
I see you do
R and D as well, huh?

09:41.999 --> 09:44.581
It's just some research
I do in my spare time.

09:44.793 --> 09:46.499
[LAUREN] It's more of
a hobby, really.

09:46.712 --> 09:47.997
My organic chemistry
is a bit rusty,

09:48.213 --> 09:52.297
but this looks like...
stem cell research.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.124
Ambitious for a hobby.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.380
I'm trying to isolate
mesenchymal cells.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.838
They're highly amenable
to genetic modification

09:59.057 --> 10:00.342
and tissue engineering.

10:00.559 --> 10:03.050
If you can crack the code,
that's the Holy Grail.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.226
The Fountain of Youth.
Everlasting life.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.475
Ah, a girl can dream.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.265
Wow.

10:10.486 --> 10:12.647
Hmm. You seem to be...

10:12.863 --> 10:14.399
a bit stuck on this one, huh?

10:14.615 --> 10:15.855
You know what,
this is complicated.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.029
I don't wanna bore you.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.197
No, no. I'm retired.

10:18.410 --> 10:19.866
This is the most fascinating
stuff I've read in years.

10:20.078 --> 10:23.286
Please. Humour me.

10:23.499 --> 10:25.740
The problem with
these particular cells

10:25.959 --> 10:27.165
is that they lack markers,

10:27.377 --> 10:29.368
making them very
difficult to isolate.

10:29.588 --> 10:32.671
Right, right, right. Have you
tried injecting a virus?

10:32.883 --> 10:34.669
Oh, sure. They just
destroy the virus.

10:34.885 --> 10:36.091
Very aggressively,
I might add.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.964
A pathogenic virus, yes.

10:38.180 --> 10:41.013
But, um...

10:41.225 --> 10:43.511
What about a TTV?

10:44.937 --> 10:46.893
You mean a benign
virus that already

10:47.105 --> 10:48.311
exists in the human body?

10:48.524 --> 10:51.687
The stem cells
won't attack it.

10:51.902 --> 10:54.644
Sometimes, a catalyst that
appears the most innocuous

10:54.863 --> 10:56.979
can do the most damage.

10:57.199 --> 11:00.191
Think of it as
a Trojan horse.

11:00.410 --> 11:01.866
--[LAUREN] Thanks.
--[DOCTOR] You're welcome.

11:02.079 --> 11:03.944
I'll keep that in mind.

11:10.045 --> 11:11.546
Excuse me, sir.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.916
Thank you,
for helping my son.

11:14.132 --> 11:15.713
I was honored I could help.

11:15.926 --> 11:16.711
I didn't catch your name.

11:16.927 --> 11:18.337
Jack.

11:18.887 --> 11:20.718
Actually...

11:20.931 --> 11:22.762
it's Hades.

11:24.726 --> 11:27.763
My father.

11:27.980 --> 11:29.595
Hi, Bo.

11:39.157 --> 11:40.988
This is your father?

11:43.996 --> 11:45.782
[DYSON]
What do you want?

11:45.998 --> 11:48.660
Maybe you should ask Bo.

11:48.876 --> 11:51.663
She's the one
who summoned me here.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.369
What's he talking about?

11:57.718 --> 11:59.424
What the hell
happened to your hand?

11:59.636 --> 12:01.467
Don't touch it.
It's spreading.

12:01.680 --> 12:02.920
Did Iris do this to you?

12:03.140 --> 12:04.880
Not Iris. Nyx.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.556
Nyx.

12:06.768 --> 12:07.393
The Nyx?

12:07.603 --> 12:08.934
[BO] ls inside Iris.

12:09.146 --> 12:10.556
I saw it in the park.

12:10.772 --> 12:13.514
Everything she touches dies
and turns to nothing.

12:13.734 --> 12:15.270
Well if she kills
everything she touches,

12:15.485 --> 12:16.144
how did you--

12:16.361 --> 12:19.148
Survive? I have no idea.

12:19.364 --> 12:21.571
But if we don't
contain her, we are all--

12:21.783 --> 12:24.695
[JACK] Burnt toast.

12:24.912 --> 12:27.654
[BO] That is why I
released you from Tartarus.

12:27.873 --> 12:30.080
Help me get rid of Nyx.

12:31.418 --> 12:32.954
I assume you mean
with the box.

12:33.170 --> 12:35.286
If it contained you,
it can contain her, too.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.211
Smart girl.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.960
That's my daughter.

12:39.885 --> 12:41.967
Yeah, let's hold off on the

12:42.179 --> 12:43.840
father-daughter bonding
for now, shall we?

12:44.056 --> 12:45.341
All right. But you're right.

12:45.557 --> 12:49.220
The box can contain a force
and send it back to Tartarus.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.518
But only one.

12:51.730 --> 12:54.267
[JACK] So, if you
use it to contain her,

12:54.483 --> 12:55.973
that means that--

12:56.193 --> 12:57.273
You'll have to stay here.

12:57.486 --> 13:01.229
Right. And if you
want to get rid of Nyx,

13:01.448 --> 13:03.814
Iris will have to die.

13:04.034 --> 13:09.995
[cell phone buzzing]

13:14.836 --> 13:15.791
Alicia.

13:16.004 --> 13:17.039
[ALICIA] So I picked up
a few groceries and

13:17.255 --> 13:19.041
you weren't kidding
about your fridge.

13:19.257 --> 13:21.339
You got no milk, but five
different kinds of mustard.

13:21.551 --> 13:24.839
Look, I, ljust--l can't
really talk right now.

13:25.055 --> 13:26.261
My son has been hurt.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.384
Oh my God, is he okay?

13:28.600 --> 13:29.840
He's stable now, yes.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.597
Um, w-what can I do?
Should I come over?

13:32.813 --> 13:35.054
No. Stay where you are.
Don't leave.

13:35.273 --> 13:36.228
[DYSON]
I might send someone over

13:36.441 --> 13:38.102
to get some clothes for him.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.979
Okay. I will.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.656
Dyson, he's waking up.

13:43.865 --> 13:45.401
I gotta go.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.703
[phone beeps]

13:48.912 --> 13:52.700
Hey. How you feeling?

13:52.916 --> 13:55.328
You gave us quite
the scare there.

13:56.962 --> 13:57.951
Iris?

13:58.171 --> 13:58.876
[groans]

13:59.089 --> 13:59.794
You're okay. No, no, no.

14:00.007 --> 14:01.167
--[MARK] Where is she?
--[LAUREN] Lie back. Lie back.

14:01.383 --> 14:02.748
[BO] Mark, we need
to find her.

14:02.968 --> 14:04.833
Do you have any idea
where she could be?

14:05.053 --> 14:07.214
[MARK] I think we were...

14:07.431 --> 14:09.638
Yeah. Yeah, we were
at Cee Cee's house.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.761
Cecelia Lawrence?
Her human body?

14:11.977 --> 14:13.842
[MARK]
She and Iris were friends.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.553
They talked to each other.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.809
The human is alive
inside of Iris?

14:19.026 --> 14:21.768
Yeah. They keep them
alive to get information.

14:21.987 --> 14:24.319
So, the humans could be alive
inside all the Ancients.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.647
I saw Iris kill
Cee Cee's dad.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.858
[BO] She killed her father?

14:29.077 --> 14:31.910
Yeah. After we had sex.

14:32.122 --> 14:35.865
Wait if she touched you,
why didn't you turn to nothing?

14:36.084 --> 14:37.494
I don't know.

14:39.087 --> 14:41.373
Wait. Wait, wait. It was...

14:41.590 --> 14:43.171
It was later.

14:43.383 --> 14:48.377
[MARK] S-She changed.
She was different.

14:48.597 --> 14:50.553
Holy shit.

14:50.766 --> 14:51.630
Where--Where are my pants?

14:51.850 --> 14:53.090
What happened? What changed?

14:53.310 --> 14:55.676
After Iris
took off the bracelet,

14:55.896 --> 14:57.887
it--it was like
something happened.

14:59.900 --> 15:02.232
Iris told me her parents
made her wear this.

15:02.444 --> 15:04.184
The bracelet is
made of Adamantine.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.519
We don't need your help.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.104
[BO] If the bracelet is made
out of the same material

15:07.324 --> 15:09.189
as the box, maybe it
can contain her, too.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.867
Contain, no.
Control, yes.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.570
[JACK]
If it's on her wrist.

15:14.790 --> 15:18.032
If it's not on her wrist,
we're all in trouble.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.958
Well then we need to
get it back on her wrist.

15:21.171 --> 15:22.707
[MARK] I'm sorry.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.379
It was my idea
to leave the party.

15:24.591 --> 15:25.797
Where did you go with her?

15:26.009 --> 15:27.715
[MARK]
I don't--l dunno.

15:27.928 --> 15:31.796
Went to Book Street Cafe,
um... Trinity Park.

15:32.015 --> 15:34.256
[MARK] Uh...

15:34.476 --> 15:37.309
We went--We went clubbing
at The Garret once.

15:37.521 --> 15:39.011
Those are all public places.

15:39.231 --> 15:40.220
I'll check the park
and the cafe.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.941
You rest.

15:42.150 --> 15:44.482
Please. Please don't
hurt her, all right.

15:44.694 --> 15:45.900
[MARK] It's not her fault.

15:46.113 --> 15:48.104
[BO] We'll do everything
we can to keep her safe.

15:48.323 --> 15:52.032
I know what it's like
to be used by your parents.

15:52.244 --> 15:53.950
[LAUREN] Bo wait, wait.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.151
Look, if you're gonna go,

15:55.372 --> 15:57.328
we need to make sure
that you're safe too.

15:57.541 --> 15:59.122
Okay. Come with me.

16:14.266 --> 16:16.973
I'd offer you a drink,
but I guess you're...

16:17.185 --> 16:19.562
indisposed.

16:19.771 --> 16:23.639
You could untie me.

16:23.859 --> 16:26.601
I could.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.902
But you're just
following orders.

16:29.114 --> 16:30.229
Right?

16:30.448 --> 16:32.313
They're not orders.

16:32.534 --> 16:34.320
[TAMSIN] Really?
Because from here

16:34.536 --> 16:36.868
it just looks like
you're Zee's little bitch.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.320
We're partners.

16:38.540 --> 16:39.700
There's a difference.

16:39.916 --> 16:44.080
Mm. Smart move giving your
partner's shield to Athena.

16:47.424 --> 16:48.789
You don't know
anything about that.

16:49.009 --> 16:51.421
[TAMSIN] I know something
about a "monumental rack."

16:51.636 --> 16:54.924
Tell me, how did that
work out for you?

16:55.140 --> 16:57.096
It didn't.

16:57.309 --> 16:59.766
[TAMSIN] What about
sacrificing your daughter?

16:59.978 --> 17:02.344
Was that your idea, too?

17:02.564 --> 17:04.771
I love Iris.

17:06.985 --> 17:08.896
We're a family and we all
have a part to play

17:09.112 --> 17:10.613
to make this world
a better place.

17:10.822 --> 17:12.403
You don't love Iris.

17:12.616 --> 17:14.823
You used her.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.197
We did what had to be done.

17:18.413 --> 17:20.529
[TAMSIN] And when you
"did what had to be done,"

17:20.749 --> 17:22.034
did Iris know that
she'd be used as

17:22.250 --> 17:24.627
a suicide bomb? Huh?

17:24.836 --> 17:27.669
And did she know you'd be
the one lighting the fuse?

17:30.425 --> 17:31.926
[HERA] Careful.

17:32.135 --> 17:34.000
I'm not the one tied up.

17:34.221 --> 17:36.337
You can't touch me.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.969
Zee's orders. Remember?

17:46.983 --> 17:49.520
I don't know
if it's the drink,

17:49.736 --> 17:53.399
but Zee's "orders" are
feeling a bit foggy right now.

17:53.615 --> 17:55.856
Here's what
I don't understand.

17:56.076 --> 17:59.239
If Zee had plans for you,
would you even know?

17:59.454 --> 18:01.160
[TAMSIN] And what happens
when she no longer

18:01.373 --> 18:03.329
needs an "idiot" like you?

18:03.541 --> 18:06.157
You know what,
don't answer that.

18:06.378 --> 18:10.496
The more you do,
the more pathetic you sound.

18:10.715 --> 18:12.797
It's embarrassing.

18:19.224 --> 18:20.304
[TAMSIN chuckles]

18:35.782 --> 18:37.488
[LAUREN] Maybe you'll
get better if you feed.

18:37.701 --> 18:39.362
No, I don't want
to take that risk.

18:39.577 --> 18:40.407
Bo, it's killing you.

18:40.620 --> 18:41.609
You know, it's not so bad.

18:41.830 --> 18:44.572
It turns out, it's kinda
the perfect shield.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.156
Are you being serious?

18:46.376 --> 18:50.085
So I guess that means no
"talk to the hand" jokes?

18:50.297 --> 18:52.037
It's a good thing that
we got back together

18:52.257 --> 18:53.588
just in time for
the world to end, huh?

18:53.800 --> 18:58.715
Hey, bright side: At least
we got back together.

18:58.930 --> 19:01.512
Well, this'll slow
down the spread.

19:01.725 --> 19:04.137
[BO] No, don't.
You can't touch me.

19:04.352 --> 19:05.967

19:08.732 --> 19:10.347
Thank you.

19:11.568 --> 19:13.729
Your smart friend is right.

19:13.945 --> 19:17.062
This will slow the spread.

19:17.282 --> 19:19.273
But you don't
have much time.

19:21.703 --> 19:22.658
[LAUREN] How are you
gonna get Iris to

19:22.871 --> 19:24.202
put the bracelet back on?

19:24.414 --> 19:26.200
Well, if anyone
can do it, it's me.

19:26.416 --> 19:27.576
She's scared and alone

19:27.792 --> 19:29.874
and doesn't know how
to control her powers.

19:30.086 --> 19:32.702
I was that girl.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.662
Will you be careful?

19:34.883 --> 19:37.295
lwill.

19:42.807 --> 19:44.183
Plan B.

19:44.392 --> 19:46.383
Hmm.

19:46.603 --> 19:48.139
[BO] I won't be
needing this box,

19:48.355 --> 19:50.562
so it's time for you
to head back to Tartarus.

19:50.774 --> 19:51.854
Happy to oblige,

19:52.067 --> 19:54.103
but there's something
you should know.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.572
That's why you
survived Nyx's touch.

20:01.785 --> 20:03.446
I put it there
to protect you.

20:03.661 --> 20:07.495
That's also why...
Mark is alive.

20:09.918 --> 20:11.249
If I go back to Tartarus,

20:11.461 --> 20:14.749
my mark will fade
and he will die.

20:14.964 --> 20:16.829
My mark never fades.
Why would his?

20:17.050 --> 20:19.257
He isn't my child.

20:19.469 --> 20:25.806
[JACK] And my mark
on you will never fade.

20:26.017 --> 20:27.803
We'll see about that.

20:31.106 --> 20:32.937
Okay. You're coming with me

20:33.149 --> 20:35.231
until I can figure out
what to do with you.

20:35.443 --> 20:37.274
[BO] Let's go.

20:56.673 --> 20:58.334
You gotta wait
like everybody else.

20:58.550 --> 21:00.962
I don't want
to wait anymore.

21:01.177 --> 21:03.293
It's all gonna happen now.

21:43.595 --> 21:46.678
[ZEE] So, this is where
the Blood King lives.

21:46.890 --> 21:49.222
How... quaint.

21:49.434 --> 21:50.594
You're not welcome here.

21:50.810 --> 21:51.595
Oh, I'm sorry.
Were you in the middle

21:51.811 --> 21:53.187
of a session
with your burn book?

21:53.396 --> 21:54.932
Get out!

After I welcomed you
so warmly into my home?

21:57.817 --> 21:59.432
I thought you'd be
more neighborly.

You don't know the
Darkness you've unleashed.

22:01.905 --> 22:03.520
I know exactly
what I've done.

22:03.740 --> 22:06.698
It's the end. But it's
also the beginning.

22:06.910 --> 22:09.617
I'm going to destroy this
world and start a new one.

22:09.829 --> 22:10.944
[ZEE]
The way it used to be.

22:11.164 --> 22:13.746
The days of sacrifice
and human worship.

22:13.958 --> 22:18.122
It's time now for us to be
seen as the Gods that we are.

Not if I can help it.

Well, "A" for effort.

Optimism is
a form of courage.

Now give me my shield back.

Get back.

22:42.779 --> 22:46.397
[ZEE] That may protect you,
but what about your people?

22:46.616 --> 22:48.527
It's a little selfish,
don't you think?

22:48.743 --> 22:51.576
If you want to see them again,
give me back my shield.

22:51.788 --> 22:53.779
Get out of my lair!

22:53.998 --> 22:55.329
Fine.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.453
How about a trade then?

Hand over my shield or
I'll hunt your people down

--[BO] You keep looking at me.
--[JACK] No, I don't.

Yes, you do.

23:33.371 --> 23:36.408
I haven't seen you
for a long time.

23:36.624 --> 23:39.661
And I'm proud to see
the woman you've become.

Well don't get too excited.

Soon as I contain Nyx
and save Iris,

23:44.674 --> 23:45.789
I'm gonna figure out
a way to send you

back where you came from.

Well you're the

That box was made for you.

And only you.

23:56.227 --> 23:58.934
Specifically you,
could bring me back.

I'm glad you're confident
that you'll rescue Iris.

24:08.406 --> 24:10.488

time ago that I would

always look out
for the little guy.

You can't kill me.

It's the only way.

inside you, Uncle Hades?

didn't you?

to be another way.

34:03.751 --> 34:05.491
--[|R|S gasping]
--[HADES] Yes.

34:05.711 --> 34:07.167
--[|R|S gasping]
--[HADES grunts]

34:07.379 --> 34:09.916
No! What are you doing?
Let her go!

34:10.132 --> 34:12.248
[gasping]

34:13.469 --> 34:15.881
[BO coughs]
Stop! She's choking me!

34:16.096 --> 34:19.054
Turn the crank, Bo.

34:19.266 --> 34:21.723
Do it! You're the
only one who can.

34:21.936 --> 34:25.349
[intense music plays]

34:25.564 --> 34:28.021
[music box plays]

34:28.234 --> 34:31.943

[music box plays]

34:32.154 --> 34:33.439
[HADES exhales]
[music box plays]

34:33.656 --> 34:41.028
[music box continues]

34:54.009 --> 34:55.260
[BO exhales]

34:55.469 --> 35:00.054
[JACK] Bo. You are
my child. My blood.

35:00.266 --> 35:02.507
I would never do
anything to hurt you.

35:17.116 --> 35:21.109
[exhales]

35:26.917 --> 35:28.578
[monitors beeping]

35:28.794 --> 35:30.750
[distant footsteps]

35:33.424 --> 35:34.789
What happened?

35:35.009 --> 35:36.374
Bo, your hand.

35:39.221 --> 35:40.802
Nyx is gone.

35:41.015 --> 35:42.255
The bracelet worked?

35:42.474 --> 35:46.183
No. It didn't.

35:46.395 --> 35:49.057
Iris and Cee Cee
are both dead.

35:51.358 --> 35:54.316
[BO] I tried. I'm sorry.

35:54.528 --> 35:56.644
You did what you had to do.

36:02.453 --> 36:04.569
I should go talk to him.

36:04.788 --> 36:07.621
No. I will.

36:17.926 --> 36:19.132
[DYSON] Hey.

36:19.345 --> 36:29.346
[music continues]

36:35.652 --> 36:37.734
You okay?

36:42.993 --> 36:46.531
No matter what I do,
someone always gets hurt.

36:46.747 --> 36:52.492
Bo. You have saved
so many, so many times.

36:52.711 --> 36:57.546
Dyson, and--and Kenzi,
and Tamsin, me...

36:59.718 --> 37:02.380
One day I'm gonna lose you too.

37:03.514 --> 37:05.129
Oh.

37:05.349 --> 37:07.340
Maybe you don't have to.

37:11.063 --> 37:12.678
[BO] Comfy Dad?

37:15.025 --> 37:18.859
[HADES chuckles]

37:19.071 --> 37:22.234
Y'know when I suggested
we talk privately,

37:24.618 --> 37:27.325
You seem to have
a thing for boxes.

37:27.538 --> 37:29.199
Figured you could
use a new one.

37:29.415 --> 37:31.076
[chuckles]

37:39.216 --> 37:41.047
[JACK] Perhaps we should
catch up over a drink,

37:41.260 --> 37:44.093
say, at your bar.
The Dal, is it?

37:47.057 --> 37:50.049
And I don't want you
near my friends.

37:52.980 --> 37:55.517
If this is about Kenzi--

37:56.942 --> 38:00.105
I said you don't get
to say her name.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.773
Ouch.

38:02.990 --> 38:06.278
[BO] You made her
close the portal.

38:06.493 --> 38:10.031
You killed my best friend
just to get to me.

38:10.247 --> 38:11.236
--[JACK] Bo--
--[BO] You know, growing Up.

38:11.457 --> 38:14.699
I imagined all the things
that I wanted to say to you.

38:16.128 --> 38:19.620
[BO] But you know
what I realized?

38:19.840 --> 38:22.502
You don't deserve it.

38:22.718 --> 38:23.878
You weren't in my life
then and I don't want you

38:24.094 --> 38:26.050
in my life now.

38:27.723 --> 38:30.806
I think it's good
I stayed out of your life.

38:31.018 --> 38:34.852
You turned out better than
if I had raised you.

38:35.063 --> 38:37.315
You're glad
that I was abducted?

38:37.524 --> 38:38.309
I didn't say that.

38:38.525 --> 38:40.937
[BO] How could you?

38:41.153 --> 38:44.862
How could you keep
Aife in that place?

38:45.073 --> 38:48.941
She had the courage
to get me out.

38:49.161 --> 38:52.369
She had the courage
to get you out?

38:55.000 --> 38:56.991
Is that what she told you?

38:57.211 --> 38:59.748
[BO] It's the truth.

38:59.963 --> 39:02.670
I thought you'd
know by now the truth

39:02.883 --> 39:05.340
is open to interpretation.

39:05.552 --> 39:07.133
What are you talking about?

39:08.555 --> 39:09.635
If Aife was crazy,

39:09.848 --> 39:11.463
it's because
you drove her crazy.

39:11.683 --> 39:14.720
The Dark Dungeons
drove her crazy.

39:14.937 --> 39:16.598
I saved her.

39:16.813 --> 39:21.273
I brought her to Tartarus,
but she was too sick.

39:21.485 --> 39:23.350
They tortured her,
you understand?

39:23.570 --> 39:25.356
No, that's what you did.

39:25.572 --> 39:26.607
For years.

39:26.823 --> 39:28.905
[JACK] You want
to blame somebody,

39:29.117 --> 39:31.324
blame your
dear grandfather.

39:31.537 --> 39:32.196
[JACK]
He's the one who sent her

39:32.412 --> 39:34.198
to the Dark Dungeons
in the first place.

39:34.414 --> 39:36.120
[BO] You kept her in a cage.

39:36.333 --> 39:38.289
[JACK]
To protect you from her.

39:38.502 --> 39:39.582
She wanted to
take you from me.

39:39.795 --> 39:41.626
I couldn't let that happen.

39:44.174 --> 39:49.168
Sending you away was the
only way to keep you safe.

39:49.388 --> 39:52.972
You expect me
to believe that?

39:53.183 --> 39:54.639
[JACK] No.

39:54.851 --> 39:57.308
But you've never heard
my side of the story.

39:57.521 --> 39:58.556
And now you don't want to.

39:58.772 --> 40:00.057
Why would I?

40:00.274 --> 40:01.605
You choked me
in an elevator.

40:01.817 --> 40:04.058
I didn't mean to, Bo.
I just wanted to talk.

40:04.278 --> 40:06.439
Well it is hard to talk with
a hand around your neck.

40:06.655 --> 40:08.486
[JACK] I invited
you in, you ran away.

40:08.699 --> 40:10.690
I didn't want you to go.

40:13.870 --> 40:18.910
You know, I'm gonna find
a way to get rid of you.

40:19.126 --> 40:23.039
Until then,
you're not going anywhere.

40:24.548 --> 40:27.631
If this is where
you want me,

40:27.843 --> 40:30.880
this is where I'll stay.

40:31.096 --> 40:34.338
We both know this
cell can't hold you.

40:36.643 --> 40:41.228
Has it occurred to you
that I might want to stay...

40:41.440 --> 40:43.226
Here...

40:43.442 --> 40:45.057
With you...?

40:54.578 --> 40:55.488
[TAMSIN] Hey Lewis.

40:55.704 --> 40:56.739
I brought something for ya.

40:56.955 --> 40:58.491
[DYSON]
Where have you been?

40:58.707 --> 41:00.197
What, you actually
noticed I was gone?

41:00.417 --> 41:02.248
Sorry. It's kinda been
a bit of a day.

41:02.461 --> 41:03.667
Tell me about it.

41:03.879 --> 41:06.416
[DYSON] Nyx is gone
and Iris is dead.

41:06.632 --> 41:08.668
But we still need to
deal with Zee and Hera.

41:08.884 --> 41:11.000
Yeah, and let's not
forget Bo's father is here.

41:11.219 --> 41:12.470
Bo's father. Is here.

41:12.679 --> 41:13.088
I know.

41:13.305 --> 41:14.670
You know? How do you know?

41:14.890 --> 41:15.640
Well, let's just
say I don't think

41:15.849 --> 41:17.180
Hera's gonna be
a problem anymore.

41:17.392 --> 41:18.222
What do you mean?

41:18.435 --> 41:19.800
Lightning bolt to the heart.

41:20.020 --> 41:21.476
Saw it with my own eyes.

41:21.688 --> 41:25.021
Turns out Zee was
Hera's Achilles heel.

41:25.233 --> 41:26.939
[DYSON]
Where are you going?

41:27.152 --> 41:28.608
Oh, now you care?

41:28.820 --> 41:30.902
Lewis. You coming or not?

41:34.868 --> 41:36.654
[DYSON exhales]

41:36.870 --> 41:38.030
[DYSON] He's not dead.

41:38.246 --> 41:40.498
No. No, he's in a coma.

41:40.707 --> 41:41.696
Can we kill him?

41:41.917 --> 41:42.531
[LAUREN]
Well, if we kill him,

41:42.751 --> 41:44.537
we'd be killing the
human inside of him too.

41:44.753 --> 41:46.459
[DYSON] Hera may have
taken over the body,

41:46.672 --> 41:48.663
but Kevin Brown
is still in there.

41:48.882 --> 41:52.420
Damn, I need a drink.

41:52.636 --> 41:53.967
Who's with me?

41:54.179 --> 41:54.804
I'm staying with Mark.

41:55.013 --> 41:57.425
And I'm meeting Bo.

41:57.641 --> 41:58.551
[sighs]

41:58.767 --> 42:01.474
Okay.

42:01.687 --> 42:05.430
You gonna tell Alicia
we found her husband?

42:05.649 --> 42:07.605
I think I'll wait
until he wakes up.

42:07.818 --> 42:10.150
[LAUREN] Question is,
if he wakes up,

42:10.362 --> 42:12.694
who will he wake up as?

42:14.825 --> 42:16.531
Hm.

42:18.036 --> 42:21.620
So, what did he say?

42:21.832 --> 42:23.447
More lies.

42:23.667 --> 42:25.874
He's trying to brainwash me,
but I won't let him.

42:26.086 --> 42:27.701
Right.

42:27.921 --> 42:31.288
Now, I know that him being
here changes everything,

42:31.508 --> 42:35.797
but you can try to look on
the bright side a little bit.

42:36.012 --> 42:37.263
--[LAUREN] Hmm?
--[BO] Uh, Mark got stabbed.

42:37.472 --> 42:38.507
Iris and Cee Cee are dead.

42:38.724 --> 42:40.555
And my dad
is at your clinic.

42:40.767 --> 42:42.303
Please tell me
the bright side because

42:42.519 --> 42:44.510
I'm all tapped out
for my gratitude journal.

42:44.730 --> 42:45.719
I can think of three reasons.

42:45.939 --> 42:46.769
What are you doing?

42:46.982 --> 42:48.643
[LAUREN]
One: We're alive.

42:48.859 --> 42:50.599
Two: We just saved
the whole world.

42:50.819 --> 42:52.855
[LAUREN] And three...

42:53.822 --> 42:55.562
I love you, Bo Dennis.

42:55.782 --> 42:57.898
I love you, too.
Now, get off the street.

42:58.118 --> 42:58.868
You're making me nervous.

42:59.077 --> 43:01.193
What're we gonna have?
We gonna do pizza or Thai?

43:01.413 --> 43:04.155
Or, or, or...
enormous cocktails?

43:04.374 --> 43:07.832
