00:59.600 --> 01:00.396
<i>Flight, this is INCO.</i>

01:00.600 --> 01:03.717
<i>We should have good K.U. coverage
all the way through L.D.S. release.</i>

01:03.920 --> 01:07.310
<i>In fact, we're covered all the way
through the landing and air lock egress.</i>

01:48.000 --> 01:51.276
<i>Houston, stack going

02:40.000 --> 02:41.149
Looks pretty good from this end.

03:02.120 --> 03:03.599
The eagle has landed...

<i>Excursion, this is Houston.</i>

04:29.640 --> 04:32.712
<i>Are you receiving rover one's carrier
signal through the landers uplink?</i>

04:33.160 --> 04:36.436
<i>That's affirm, Houston. We expect
excellent video from rover one.</i>

04:40.320 --> 04:41.878
<i>Not for one nation...</i>

04:42.760 --> 04:44.318
<i>not for one people...</i>

<i>Patrick, this is Excursion.</i>

05:06.680 --> 05:09.717
<i>I need you to check rover two's

05:10.640 --> 05:13.677
<i>Patrick, would you take a look
at your primary O-2...</i>

05:13.880 --> 05:15.836
<i>and power levels on your D.C.M.</i>

05:17.040 --> 05:18.996

<i>Structure around is loamy.</i>

05:24.800 --> 05:28.110
<i>Loose topsoil is rock.
Drill bit shows signs of wear and tear.</i>

05:29.840 --> 05:32.070
It'll last. One more area.

05:32.280 --> 05:34.157
Sector 112, okay?

05:34.960 --> 05:36.757
It might have been
a canal bed.

05:40.560 --> 05:43.632
<i>Eight years of training,
and I'm a Martian ditchdigger.</i>

05:46.400 --> 05:48.789
You have 1 hour, 30 minutes

And counting.

05:53.680 --> 05:56.956
<i>Final sample loaded.
Prepping for air lock ingress.</i>

05:57.400 --> 05:59.960
<i>In a world beset by violence,
hunger and strife...</i>

06:00.160 --> 06:02.799
<i>there are occasions
when mankind surpasses...</i>

06:03.000 --> 06:05.514
<i>the petty struggles
of daily existence.</i>

06:05.760 --> 06:09.309
<i>The Excursion voyage to Mars
is one of those occasions.</i>

06:09.520 --> 06:11.715
<i>Today America is proud.</i>

06:11.920 --> 06:13.911
I told them not to go!

06:17.840 --> 06:20.149
<i>Three, two, one...</i>

07:19.040 --> 07:20.678
Let's get you out of here.

07:27.400 --> 07:30.233
Oh, my God.
It was incredible.

07:30.760 --> 07:33.558
<i>A tremendous achievement
that once again proves...</i>

07:33.760 --> 07:37.196
<i>that if we can rise above
partisan politics...</i>

07:37.440 --> 07:40.512
<i>America can climb to the heavens.</i>

07:41.320 --> 07:43.914
Thank you, Mr. President.
The credit goes to my crew.

07:44.560 --> 07:48.075
<i>Fly home safe, son.
Our prayers are with you and...</i>

07:48.320 --> 07:49.514
<i>God bless you.</i>

07:50.560 --> 07:51.913
Thank you, Mr. President.

07:54.760 --> 07:57.194
<i>Flight, Nav. We'd like the crew
to take a star tracker pass...</i>

07:57.400 --> 08:01.234
<i>and perform an I.M.U. alignment
before we update the state vector.</i>

08:03.040 --> 08:06.589
<i>CAPCOM, let the crew know Navigation
wants a fix on a star position...</i>

08:06.800 --> 08:08.552
<i>and alignment of
the interior moment unit...</i>

08:08.760 --> 08:11.354
<i>before putting a new
state vector on board.</i>

08:23.200 --> 08:26.829
Houston, this is Excursion.
We have your new state vector on board.

08:27.440 --> 08:30.113
<i>Excursion, Houston. We copy you.
Have received the updated vector.</i>

08:30.840 --> 08:32.796

<i>Copy.</i>

08:43.919 --> 08:45.114
<i>Excursion, you are good to go.</i>

08:46.440 --> 08:49.193
Thanks, Huston.
Thirty seconds to transfer orbit TIG.

08:49.840 --> 08:51.831
We're homeward bound, baby.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.234
Yes, sirs!

09:14.600 --> 09:16.670
<i>Excursion, Houston.</i>

<i>Excursion, this is Houston calling.
Do you read us? Over.</i>

09:57.200 --> 09:59.589
<i>Excursion, this is Houston.
Do you copy?</i>

10:00.520 --> 10:01.430
<i>For the past three minutes...</i>

10:01.680 --> 10:04.194
<i>every attempt to communicate
with the Excursion has failed.</i>

10:05.000 --> 10:07.036
I told 'em not to go to Mars!

10:08.040 --> 10:09.758
I told 'em not to go!

10:10.760 --> 10:13.320
<i>G.C., Flight. Check all relay
stations on the network.</i>

10:13.520 --> 10:15.715
<i>Have the backup TDRS
on standby.</i>

10:16.320 --> 10:19.039
<i>Flight to all operators.
Pull up your data passes from the burn.</i>

10:19.240 --> 10:21.800
<i>Get with your back rooms.
Verify that we saw no anomalies.</i>

10:22.000 --> 10:24.355
<i>For God's sake, somebody
tell me she didn't blow.</i>

10:35.440 --> 10:36.919
Houston, this is Excursion.

10:37.760 --> 10:39.876
We had a malfunction
in the K.U. band antenna.

10:40.080 --> 10:41.513
Lost telemetry and comm.

10:42.480 --> 10:45.756
I performed a bit of I.F.M.
Seems to be okay now.

10:46.840 --> 10:48.319
Excursion crew is okay.

10:49.120 --> 10:51.190
Headed for rendezvous
with Big Blue.

10:51.800 --> 10:54.951
It's gonna be good to get home.
Over and out.

11:39.680 --> 11:42.911
The Extraterrestrial
Vulnerability Experiment...

11:43.120 --> 11:44.951
has one central goal:

11:45.600 --> 11:47.909
to discover a means
to defend ourselves...

11:48.120 --> 11:51.476
against the alien species
should they ever return to Earth.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.719
Now, as you know, gentlemen,
Eve was re-created

11:54.920 --> 11:56.512
from a frozen lab embryo.

11:56.720 --> 11:59.154
She's a genetic duplicate
of the original Sil.

12:00.080 --> 12:02.674
Now, we have deliberately
shielded Eve...

12:02.880 --> 12:05.713
from any direct contact
with the male gender...

12:05.920 --> 12:09.037
which is why, gentlemen,
you're inside there.

12:09.920 --> 12:10.432
So...

12:13.400 --> 12:14.355
proceed.

12:29.480 --> 12:30.151
Help!

12:37.600 --> 12:39.477
Laura! Please!

12:46.480 --> 12:48.038
Okay, that's enough.
Bring her up.

13:12.440 --> 13:13.759
Bingo, Dr. Baker!

13:14.560 --> 13:15.470
It worked!

13:15.880 --> 13:18.269
Take a look at those
beautiful welts.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.716
Just beautiful.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.312
What happened, Dr. Baker?

13:34.840 --> 13:38.799
Our problem in a nutshell:
A toxic agent works once...

13:39.320 --> 13:43.029
but then it becomes useless
once the alien's biology adapts.

13:43.600 --> 13:46.637
You've gone out of your way
to give this... this lab animal...

13:46.840 --> 13:49.718
a living situation
that's fit for a queen!

13:50.040 --> 13:53.589
I suggest you spend more time
finding a way to 86 the damn thing.

13:54.680 --> 13:58.958
Colonel, you're welcome
to replace me anytime you like.

14:05.480 --> 14:06.435
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

14:07.640 --> 14:10.916
Tell Dr. Baker
we must continue testing.

14:12.120 --> 14:13.189
Aye, aye, sir.

14:28.680 --> 14:30.511
Why do you do this to me?

14:32.000 --> 14:33.433
I'm sorry, Eve.

14:34.400 --> 14:35.958
I've explained to you
why we've got to do this...

14:36.160 --> 14:38.355
what happened
with the first Sil.

14:40.200 --> 14:41.872
And why you have to be prepared.

14:42.080 --> 14:44.150
Survival of the fittest.
I know.

14:50.440 --> 14:52.237
I watch this TV...

14:52.440 --> 14:54.271
and I see all the places
I'm never gonna go...

14:54.640 --> 14:56.915
and see all the people
I'm never gonna meet.

14:58.400 --> 14:59.549
Is that all I am to you?

15:00.440 --> 15:02.112
A laboratory animal?

15:04.080 --> 15:06.389
I want you to understand
that the reason I took this job...

15:06.600 --> 15:10.513
was to make sure that these experiments
were done with regard for you.

15:15.800 --> 15:17.836
Just don't forget
that I'm human too.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.592
<i>Main gear touchdown.</i>

15:25.520 --> 15:27.875
<i>Shuttle ground support vehicles
with flight surgeon and medical team...</i>

15:28.080 --> 15:30.150
<i>in the crew recovery vehicle
are en route.</i>

15:30.920 --> 15:33.434
Thanks, Houston.
It's good to be home.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.953
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

15:43.760 --> 15:48.231
On preliminary examination, all three
of you are in remarkable health...

15:48.680 --> 15:51.831
though, of course, I'll continue
more specific blood testing.

15:52.280 --> 15:56.114
We do have a few people here
who would like a further examination.

15:59.240 --> 16:02.437
Boy, there's enough fine booty
out there to cure what ails me.

16:04.600 --> 16:07.273
You're under quarantine,
Mr. Gamble.

16:07.480 --> 16:09.948
No sexual activity
for at least ten days.

16:10.680 --> 16:13.240
- And that means all of you.
- Oh, you've gotta be kidding.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.313
No, I'm not kidding.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.954
<i>Back when President Kennedy
began the space program...</i>

16:37.400 --> 16:39.789
I was just a very young
assistant up on the Hill.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.912
It didn't take me long to realize
that he was a visionary...

16:43.400 --> 16:44.958
and that I shared that vision.

16:45.520 --> 16:47.192
Later on,
when I became a senator...

16:47.400 --> 16:51.075
I was determined to push our program
even further into space.

16:51.680 --> 16:54.752
And so today,
Jack Kennedy's vision...

16:54.960 --> 16:58.669
is maintained by the commitment
of American business.

16:59.320 --> 17:02.073
But I like to think
that his spirit is embodied...

17:02.280 --> 17:04.555
in young men like Patrick Ross.

17:05.599 --> 17:08.751
- When Patrick was five years old...
- What happened to Patrick?

17:09.119 --> 17:13.113
I don't know, but he's missing some
major butt-kissing from his own father.

17:13.640 --> 17:15.436
He hasn't been feeling
very well tonight.

17:15.640 --> 17:18.358
Tell you the truth, I haven't
been feeling so great either.

17:18.560 --> 17:22.394
Yeah, I think what we all need
is a little tender loving care.

17:33.480 --> 17:37.632
So it's with pleasure that I introduce
one of our finest young leaders,

17:38.480 --> 17:40.277
the captain of the Mars mission,

17:40.800 --> 17:43.917
and my son, Patrick Ross.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.149
I've gotta go.

17:59.360 --> 18:02.193
Lincoln suite, upstairs.
Hurry.

18:12.080 --> 18:14.036
Captain Ross, everyone's
waiting. This way, sir.

18:27.080 --> 18:28.229
Nice of you to show up.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.953
Thank you all
for coming out this evening.

18:38.560 --> 18:39.549
Thank you, Father,

18:39.760 --> 18:42.274
for what I'm sure
were overly kind words.

18:43.440 --> 18:46.557
I've been chosen
on behalf of my wonderful crew...

18:47.080 --> 18:49.913
to represent
the mission to Mars...

18:50.720 --> 18:52.312
and an image
that comes to my mind...

18:53.160 --> 18:55.674
is looking through the porthole...

18:57.000 --> 18:58.513
at the blue-white globe...

18:59.480 --> 19:00.595
beautiful...

19:02.200 --> 19:03.872
so fragile, so small.

19:06.560 --> 19:08.152
And I thought to myself...

19:08.760 --> 19:12.355
how easy it would be to destroy
all that God has created.

19:14.760 --> 19:16.830
I think, as we look
to the future...

19:17.720 --> 19:19.836
our greatest mission
might be right here at home.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.274
It's open.

19:49.240 --> 19:50.036
Come on in.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.597
My sister decided to join us.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.592
We share everything...

20:04.160 --> 20:04.876
together.

20:14.240 --> 20:18.279
<i>Parker's going for two,
and he's in there, standing!</i>

20:19.040 --> 20:21.315
Pulse rate is 20 percent
below human norm.

20:21.960 --> 20:24.235
What do you expect, Brea?
She's watching baseball.

20:32.880 --> 20:34.871
Oh, God!

20:43.120 --> 20:44.758
You are a hero.

20:47.240 --> 20:48.468
Oh, God.

20:53.560 --> 20:54.834
It's my turn.

20:58.040 --> 21:00.235
Yes, it is.

21:27.240 --> 21:29.674
<i>Here it comes!
Parker's going for three!</i>

21:30.920 --> 21:32.558
Jeez! Did someone hit a home run?

21:47.520 --> 21:49.351
My God, help me!

21:56.080 --> 21:57.308
Get off me!

22:00.040 --> 22:02.156
Marcy! Get him off me!

22:04.000 --> 22:05.718
Oh, my God!

22:07.480 --> 22:09.471
Help me, someone!

22:24.240 --> 22:26.435
- What the hell is going on?
- My God!

23:11.960 --> 23:14.997
Last night,
after the fund-raiser...

23:16.280 --> 23:17.599
something happened.

23:19.880 --> 23:22.269
I try to think about it,
I draw a total blank.

23:24.080 --> 23:27.277
They always make those drinks
at those fund-raisers strong.

23:29.440 --> 23:31.431
That's the way they get
the wallets to open up.

23:31.640 --> 23:34.791
Billy, you tell that old son-of-a-bitch
I won't take no for an answer.

23:40.760 --> 23:43.991
There's something wrong with me,
Dad, since I got back.

23:44.760 --> 23:46.955
Do you think
a trip to Mars was rough?

23:47.560 --> 23:49.278
You just wait till you try
a senate campaign.

23:49.880 --> 23:51.757
Dad, listen to me.
I'm having...

23:52.680 --> 23:54.511
I'm having
some kind of breakdown.

23:55.200 --> 23:59.034
Stop thinking about the master plan
and help me, all right? I'm scared.

23:59.640 --> 24:02.916
Goddamn it!
Quit acting like a spoiled child.

24:05.160 --> 24:07.196
You're a Ross.
Behave like one.

24:10.280 --> 24:12.669
And I'm gonna give you
a piece of advice, boy.

24:14.080 --> 24:16.992
You keep your dick in your pants
and your eyes on the prize.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.993
<i>Oh, I know what you been doin',
and frankly, I don't give a damn.</i>

24:22.200 --> 24:25.158
But I have seen too many young men
with promising careers...

24:25.640 --> 24:27.392
piss it all away
on a piece of ass.

24:30.600 --> 24:34.593
People love you, Patrick.
Hell, boy, they idolize you.

24:35.760 --> 24:38.228
You're gonna be President
of the United States someday.

24:42.960 --> 24:45.872
Now, let's take a walk
through the gallery.

24:46.840 --> 24:50.196
Some of my illustrious colleagues
are just dyin' to get your autograph.

24:54.520 --> 24:55.430
Yes, sir.

24:56.840 --> 24:59.718
Yes, it's very important
that I speak with Herman Cromwell.

25:00.320 --> 25:01.878
No, he's a patient there.

25:03.520 --> 25:06.956
<i>Well, can I get a message to him
that Dr. Orinsky called</i>

25:07.200 --> 25:09.714
<i>from the lab at Oldham Space Center
up in Maryland?</i>

25:10.600 --> 25:12.556
<i>Yes, it's very important
that I speak to him.</i>

25:12.760 --> 25:14.671
<i>I'm an old colleague of his.</i>

25:20.640 --> 25:22.278
I can't believe this.

25:31.200 --> 25:32.633
Oh, my God!

26:53.440 --> 26:56.671
Company, halt! Left, left...

26:57.040 --> 26:58.189
<i>The substance found</i>

26:58.520 --> 27:02.911
<i>in Dr. Orinsky's wounds
is combinant alien-human DNA.</i>

27:04.560 --> 27:07.358
<i>This DNA is structurally
similar to Eve's...</i>

27:07.840 --> 27:09.319
but it's not a perfect match.

27:09.520 --> 27:11.750
Obviously, Eve
has not left the compound...

27:11.960 --> 27:15.919
which means, gentlemen,
that there's another one out there.

27:16.680 --> 27:20.229
None of our intelligence suggests
that a foreign power was involved.

27:20.920 --> 27:22.672
How do we start looking
for this thing?

27:23.160 --> 27:26.994
Well, I would suggest
normal investigative procedure...

27:27.200 --> 27:30.829
to cultivate a list of possible suspects
and then test their blood.

27:31.400 --> 27:35.109
Thank you, Dr. Baker. We may ask you
to help us track it down.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.317
<i>Always a pleasure, gentlemen.</i>

27:39.080 --> 27:40.069
Get Press Lennox.

28:18.720 --> 28:21.951
Ladies and gentlemen,
the embassy is secure.

28:22.760 --> 28:24.398
The hostages are free.

28:29.680 --> 28:30.430
Press Lennox.

28:31.120 --> 28:34.112
Diplomatic security.
Provides embassy guards...

28:35.120 --> 28:36.599
and protects against...

28:37.320 --> 28:39.390
kidnapping and assassination...

28:40.720 --> 28:42.790
and also, of course,
special services...

28:43.000 --> 28:45.878
like the demonstration
we witnessed here today.

28:46.240 --> 28:49.118
Excuse me, Mr. Lennox.
Somebody needs to see you right away.

28:50.760 --> 28:53.593
My assistant will answer
any questions you might have.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.313
Thank you all very much.

28:55.720 --> 28:57.870
Ladies and gentlemen, are there
any questions I can answer?

28:58.240 --> 29:02.313
Are you equipped with
night vision attack capabilities?

29:04.120 --> 29:06.918
That was really, really great.

29:08.680 --> 29:09.635
Well?

29:11.040 --> 29:12.553
The answer is no.

29:13.120 --> 29:15.076
Press, we got another
fucking alien on the loose.

29:18.160 --> 29:19.229
Get somebody else.

29:19.920 --> 29:22.388
Come on, buddy.
Your country calls.

29:24.520 --> 29:26.272
Don't start waving the flag.

29:26.720 --> 29:29.917
I'm in the private sector now.
I've got a business to run.

29:30.120 --> 29:33.430
Look at me, Press.
You know how I got this goddamn eye.

29:34.120 --> 29:36.714
It's a sacrifice I'd make
again in a heartbeat.

29:37.200 --> 29:41.318
But then maybe you haven't learned
the meaning of sacrifice.

29:46.920 --> 29:48.194
Listen, pal.

29:48.400 --> 29:51.472
The last time I fought
with that alien she-bitch...

29:51.880 --> 29:53.836
I almost got myself killed.

29:54.400 --> 29:57.312
If the government was stupid
enough to make another one...

29:58.280 --> 30:00.350
I think they can clean up
the mess by themselves.

30:00.560 --> 30:01.470
We didn't make this one.

30:03.800 --> 30:05.518
Count me out of
the search party, okay?

30:06.280 --> 30:07.349
Where is my fucking key?

30:08.400 --> 30:10.834
A million dollars, tax free.

30:12.400 --> 30:13.515
Sure you won't reconsider?

30:19.280 --> 30:22.511
Welcome to Biohazard Four.
Dr. Baker!

30:25.280 --> 30:26.315
Come out here!

30:27.040 --> 30:28.075
Oh, my God.

30:29.800 --> 30:32.837
Open the doors!
Somebody open the doors!

30:33.360 --> 30:35.112
Get him away from there!

30:35.600 --> 30:37.113
Somebody open the doors!

30:43.040 --> 30:44.359
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

30:44.840 --> 30:47.308
You know there's no men allowed
in this lab. Get away!

30:47.520 --> 30:49.670
- Calm down, Dr. Baker.
- Do you have respect for this?

30:49.880 --> 30:52.952
- Out now, both of you!
- We have an emergency.

30:53.160 --> 30:54.718
Okay, we'll take it outside.

30:55.080 --> 30:57.514
- Damn well right we'll take it outside.
- Don't blow a gasket.

30:57.720 --> 30:59.199
Don't patronize me.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.789
We're not patronizing.
We're coming along.

31:02.680 --> 31:03.829
Close the doors.

31:10.480 --> 31:12.550
Laura, correct me if I'm wrong.

31:12.760 --> 31:14.751
Are you involved
in this crazy bullshit?

31:15.120 --> 31:18.749
Dr. Baker runs this facility.
She cloned the Sil embryo.

31:19.080 --> 31:23.039
Oh. Okay, well,
what should I call her?

31:23.720 --> 31:24.391
Sil Lite?

31:24.960 --> 31:28.839
- Her name is Eve.
- Eve. How very biblical.

31:29.040 --> 31:30.712
We have dampened
her mating instinct.

31:30.920 --> 31:33.593
We have strictly avoided the presence
of testosterone in this lab.

31:33.800 --> 31:36.234
At least until now.
Thank you for your help in that area.

31:37.160 --> 31:38.354
What if she gets
out of there?

31:40.240 --> 31:42.879
She's electronically tethered
to a control box.

31:43.080 --> 31:46.834
One step off the premises, and
a toxic capsule explodes in her brain.

31:48.080 --> 31:50.116
You know, it's really great
to see you again...

31:50.320 --> 31:53.039
and I was hoping we'd meet
under better circumstances...

31:53.240 --> 31:57.472
but, I remember Laura Baker
having a little bit more soul.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.230
Just who the hell
do you think you are?

32:00.440 --> 32:03.477
You're coming into my lab,
questioning my motives!

32:03.680 --> 32:04.556
Are you two finished?

32:05.920 --> 32:08.480
We have a national fucking emergency
on our hands!

32:09.000 --> 32:11.389
Now, you two
will work together.

32:11.600 --> 32:13.670
That's a direct order
from the Pentagon.

32:13.880 --> 32:17.475
You killed one of these fucking
alien things before. Do it again.

32:24.000 --> 32:27.515
You heard the man.
Now the fun begins.

32:30.040 --> 32:34.830
<i>I went over Orinsky's phone records,
and this is the last place he called.</i>

32:35.120 --> 32:38.430
<i>There's a patient named
Herman Cromwell.</i>

32:39.040 --> 32:41.600
Turns out he taught Orinsky
at Stanford.

32:42.040 --> 32:44.759
And what exactly
is Cromwell doing here?

32:45.080 --> 32:46.877
Well, that's
the interesting part.

32:47.400 --> 32:50.198
It's classified
top-secret information.

32:50.880 --> 32:53.075
I was doing research
on a Mars meteorite.

32:53.920 --> 32:56.070
The one found
in the Antarctic in '96?

32:57.840 --> 33:01.879
Fossils in the meteorite convinced us
there might have been life on Mars.

33:02.480 --> 33:06.439
But these fossils weren't anything
organic to the planet. Oh, no.

33:07.080 --> 33:08.638
And what was the basis
for that determination?

33:08.840 --> 33:11.593
Carbon-based elements
in the fossils...

33:11.800 --> 33:14.678
exist only
in the Magellanic galaxy.

33:15.440 --> 33:17.715
That's 100 million
light years away.

33:18.440 --> 33:19.714
Well, how did they get to Mars?

33:20.680 --> 33:22.193
By my reckoning...

33:22.800 --> 33:25.155
Mars was visited
by an alien species...

33:25.360 --> 33:27.396
approximately
one billion years ago.

33:28.720 --> 33:30.836
The species was like
a plague, a cancer.

33:31.680 --> 33:33.159
It turned a thriving planet with...

33:33.840 --> 33:35.956
rivers and oceans
and rudimentary plant life...

33:36.160 --> 33:38.071
into a useless hunk of rock.

33:38.920 --> 33:41.070
When I heard they were going
to send a mission to Mars...

33:41.280 --> 33:43.396
I strongly urged the government
to reconsider.

33:44.160 --> 33:45.434
On what grounds?

33:46.120 --> 33:49.271
On grounds that alien DNA
might remain on the planet...

33:50.000 --> 33:52.230
that any human attempt
to violate the planet...

33:52.440 --> 33:55.273
would result
in biological contamination.

33:57.720 --> 34:01.429
So, let me guess. They told you
to shove it up your ass.

34:01.960 --> 34:03.916
They got me fired from Stanford.

34:05.200 --> 34:09.318
It seems the military had strategic
reasons for wanting to go to Mars.

34:09.920 --> 34:13.036
Outpost of the future,
or some crap like that.

34:13.679 --> 34:16.239
Anyway, they harassed
the shit out of me.

34:16.920 --> 34:19.992
I got into a fistfight
with a Pentagon general...

34:20.880 --> 34:22.199
and broke his goddamn jaw.

34:27.199 --> 34:29.190
That's why they stuck you
in here, right?

34:31.440 --> 34:34.237
Why do you think that Dr. Orinsky
called you the night that he died?

34:34.840 --> 34:36.717
To tell me I was right.

34:38.280 --> 34:40.157
Whatever species destroyed Mars...

34:40.360 --> 34:43.272
those poor astronauts
brought down to Earth.

34:45.800 --> 34:48.268
May God have pity on our souls.

34:50.320 --> 34:52.675
<i>I'll tell you one thing.
For General Lee...</i>

34:53.040 --> 34:55.429
<i>to be eatin' up the road
this early in the mornin'...</i>

34:55.840 --> 34:58.559
<i>something's sure got
Bo and Luke all head up.</i>

34:58.760 --> 35:00.955
<i>I figure it's got somethin'
to do with women.</i>

35:01.640 --> 35:05.030
<i>Or huntin'.
Or maybe wheels.</i>

35:12.680 --> 35:16.559
The temperature on Mars
is approximately 225 degrees below zero.

35:16.760 --> 35:18.910
If they brought the samples on board,
the temperature thaw...

35:19.120 --> 35:21.634
could have brought the DNA
back to life.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.468
That DNA could have infected
the astronauts.

35:24.680 --> 35:27.672
This isn't the fucking X Files,
goddamn it!

35:27.880 --> 35:30.394
You are following a lead
based on the interrogation...

35:30.600 --> 35:32.352
of a certified nutcase.

35:33.120 --> 35:35.714
We got one dead N.S.E.G. doctor...

35:36.480 --> 35:38.948
we have a guy who warned
the government not to go to Mars...

35:39.160 --> 35:40.991
they slapped him in a loony bin...

35:41.760 --> 35:45.150
and a seven-minute time gap
during the space flight.

35:45.480 --> 35:48.756
We need to do blood analysis
on Sampas, Gamble and Ross.

35:50.160 --> 35:53.072
Now, I know that there is
a sexual quarantine of ten days...

35:53.280 --> 35:57.159
on all interplanetary missions,
and the Mars quarantine ends tonight.

35:57.600 --> 35:59.636
They could fuck the human race
into extinction.

36:01.480 --> 36:05.268
You want to be responsible for that
if we don't start testing everybody now?

36:10.120 --> 36:11.314
Test Patrick first.

36:15.120 --> 36:15.757
Yeah.

36:20.440 --> 36:22.954
I've been waiting
to get you alone.

36:24.480 --> 36:27.711
All the interviews,
all the screaming girls...

36:29.240 --> 36:30.639
all the hoopla...

36:31.880 --> 36:32.790
gone.

36:33.760 --> 36:35.671
Push it out of your mind.

36:39.960 --> 36:41.393
Patrick Ross...

36:42.680 --> 36:43.669
tonight...

36:47.920 --> 36:49.069
you're mine.

36:51.560 --> 36:52.788
I love you.

37:09.400 --> 37:10.799
What's the matter?

37:11.040 --> 37:13.634
I don't know.
We should hold off.

37:13.840 --> 37:16.195
Oh, no. No, you don't.
Not tonight.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.391
Come on, Missy.
I don't feel so good.

37:20.280 --> 37:21.429
Relax.

37:22.440 --> 37:24.078
Let me do the work.

37:41.280 --> 37:42.554
There's nobody here.

37:43.760 --> 37:45.398
Where the fuck did he go?

37:49.040 --> 37:50.678
Let's go find the others.

37:57.320 --> 37:58.992
I missed you up there.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.718
I missed you so much.

38:04.120 --> 38:05.712
It's so beautiful.

38:07.560 --> 38:09.437
Not as beautiful as you are.

38:10.400 --> 38:11.594
Charmer.

38:21.200 --> 38:22.633
Take it easy, Press.
You're gonna get us killed.

38:22.840 --> 38:25.229
Trust me, Laura.
I got a bad feeling in my stomach.

38:37.760 --> 38:39.716
God, I missed making love
with you.

38:41.720 --> 38:42.470
Oh, my stomach!

38:42.680 --> 38:44.113
- Oh, my God!
- Call someone!

38:44.320 --> 38:45.992
Call for help!

38:47.600 --> 38:48.715
Up here. Come on!

38:56.920 --> 38:58.114
No, please!

39:18.040 --> 39:18.631
Oh, God.

39:20.880 --> 39:22.393
I'm gonna get a full crew.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.153
I'm gonna get 'em over here
right away.

39:25.800 --> 39:27.552
We gotta get to the others.

39:30.880 --> 39:32.518
Oh, this is awful.

39:33.240 --> 39:34.355
This is just awful.

39:49.400 --> 39:50.549
I'll take her the rest of the way.

39:50.760 --> 39:51.909
Have a good evening.

39:52.240 --> 39:53.559
This is nice.

39:53.760 --> 39:55.432
You thought I lived on a tugboat.

39:55.640 --> 39:58.632
I know what you thought.
But I got it all under control now.

39:58.840 --> 39:59.636
Oh, you do?

39:59.840 --> 40:02.559
Yeah, you just slide
right over there.

40:02.760 --> 40:04.159
Let me open this door.

40:04.360 --> 40:06.590
There we go.
Hey, girl.

40:33.400 --> 40:34.992
- Is that it?
- No, honey, that's not it.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.394
Right there.

40:36.600 --> 40:37.828
No, that's not it.

40:40.400 --> 40:41.628
Oh, that's it.

40:43.800 --> 40:44.869
What's wrong?

40:46.920 --> 40:49.388
Dennis Gamble, we'd like you
to come with us.

40:50.840 --> 40:53.638
Man, a brother just can't get no booty.
You know what I'm sayin'?

40:54.320 --> 40:57.357
This is no way to treat a national hero.
This is embarrassing.

40:57.680 --> 41:00.069
What is this all about?
Look, somebody speak to me.

41:02.160 --> 41:04.799
Hey, I'm a personal friend
of Senator Judson Ross, okay?

41:05.000 --> 41:07.833
Personal friend. I'm gonna eat
your badge for breakfast.

41:08.040 --> 41:09.712
Get your hand
off my head, man.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.956
I demand an explanation.

41:16.800 --> 41:18.791
We'll have the test results
in a few minutes.

41:19.080 --> 41:21.992
Why am I being tested?
N.S.E.G. said I was fine.

41:22.200 --> 41:24.509
Sit tight, son.
We'll explain everything later.

41:24.720 --> 41:26.995
Well, it's kind of tough
to sit tight, sir.

41:27.200 --> 41:28.633
I haven't been laid in 11 months.

41:29.960 --> 41:31.109
That's unusual for me.

41:32.320 --> 41:35.118
Take it easy, Burgess.
Everybody deserves an explanation.

41:35.320 --> 41:36.389
You're damn right.

41:36.600 --> 41:39.831
And what's with all these guards?
What the hell is going on around here?

41:40.640 --> 41:42.198
It's purely
a precautionary measure.

41:43.040 --> 41:46.350
We need a couple of minutes
for the blood analysis, so just relax.

41:50.040 --> 41:51.632
Couple of questions.

41:51.840 --> 41:55.879
What can you tell us about the seven
minutes when the Excursion lost contact?

41:56.080 --> 41:56.796
I can't remember.

41:57.560 --> 42:00.358
I don't know if I blacked out,
I can't remember.

42:00.920 --> 42:02.399
When did you last speak
to Anne Sampas?

42:03.280 --> 42:04.998
At that fund-raiser
the other night.

42:05.200 --> 42:06.076
Did she act peculiar?

42:06.640 --> 42:07.789
She seemed fine to me.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.196
What's this all about?
Something happen to her?

42:12.480 --> 42:13.469
You tell me.

42:14.920 --> 42:16.319
What happened to Anne Sampas?

42:16.920 --> 42:18.319
Tell me what happened to her!

42:19.160 --> 42:20.388
Anne Sampas is dead.

42:23.640 --> 42:24.959
I'm sorry, Dennis.

42:34.440 --> 42:35.156
Yeah. Laura.

42:37.880 --> 42:42.590
Well, the combinant DNA in Anne's body
doesn't match what I found in Orinsky's.

42:43.160 --> 42:45.515
So, it's either Gamble or Ross.

42:46.080 --> 42:47.354
Be careful, Press.

42:52.280 --> 42:53.838
What was the cause of death?

42:54.040 --> 42:55.109
We don't know.

42:55.320 --> 42:56.639
Come on.
How the hell did she die?

42:56.840 --> 42:58.398
Sequence almost complete.

42:58.600 --> 43:00.955
- Why are you testing my blood?
- Ten seconds till relay.

43:01.160 --> 43:03.515
- You think I killed Annie?
- Data retrieval on-line.

43:03.720 --> 43:05.153
- Is that what you think?
- Five seconds. Three seconds.

43:05.360 --> 43:07.999
I didn't kill her! I swear!

43:08.840 --> 43:12.594
Computer says normal.
There is no sign of infection.

43:15.200 --> 43:17.270
- Go home, get some rest.
- Look, I want answers!

43:17.480 --> 43:19.914
In due time.
We'll be in touch.

43:22.480 --> 43:23.117
Yo, Gamble.

43:24.400 --> 43:25.913
You know where Patrick Ross is?

43:27.320 --> 43:28.196
Nope.

43:30.160 --> 43:32.549
Well, if you see him,
you'll let me know, yeah?

43:34.480 --> 43:35.196
Sure.

43:43.960 --> 43:48.795
Well, let's see what
the cranial cavity has to say.

44:17.920 --> 44:19.990
Now I'll just reach
behind her ear, and we should...

44:46.520 --> 44:47.236
God.

45:21.640 --> 45:22.516
Patrick, no!

46:50.040 --> 46:51.234
Want a date, mister?

47:01.400 --> 47:02.310
I was scared, man.

47:02.760 --> 47:03.431
This is crazy.

47:04.040 --> 47:06.759
His whole head just grew right back
like some sort of damn freak show.

47:07.320 --> 47:09.550
The alien species
can regenerate living tissue.

47:10.160 --> 47:11.559
Aliens, little green men.

47:12.080 --> 47:13.308
I still can't believe it.

47:13.520 --> 47:15.988
If they knew there were aliens
up there, why did they send us?

47:16.200 --> 47:18.998
N.S.E.G. got warned
but they chose to ignore it.

47:21.040 --> 47:24.794
We think that there was some hostile DNA
in the soil samples that you collected.

47:26.920 --> 47:28.239
Something happened up there.

47:29.200 --> 47:30.269
I can't remember exactly.

47:31.520 --> 47:32.919
I just know it was terrible.

47:33.120 --> 47:35.076
I'm sure that it was terrible.

47:35.280 --> 47:37.953
The question is:
How do we proceed now?

47:38.440 --> 47:41.637
I got guys out there all over the place
looking for this kid.

47:41.840 --> 47:44.673
Any place he might be.
We're gonna find him sooner or later.

47:45.160 --> 47:47.754
If he's reproducing,
we've got potential offspring.

47:48.360 --> 47:51.796
I think it's safe to assume he's banging
cocktail waitresses two at a time.

47:52.720 --> 47:55.314
Well, then in less than two weeks,
these offspring reach adolescence...

47:55.520 --> 47:57.158
and then they enter
the chrysalis stage.

47:57.560 --> 47:58.356
Chrysalis stage?

47:59.120 --> 48:01.918
A cocoon which
turns them into adults.

48:07.400 --> 48:09.994
Hey, baby,
turn that car around.

48:13.320 --> 48:15.959
Hey, don't leave me.
Come on.

48:17.120 --> 48:18.633
Hi, honey.

48:20.920 --> 48:21.670
Baby, come back.

48:22.120 --> 48:26.033
<i>A serial killer may be loose
in the Washington-Maryland area.</i>

48:26.240 --> 48:29.073
<i>Authorities have asked the public
to be extremely cautious...</i>

48:29.280 --> 48:31.396
<i>when approached by strangers.</i>

48:31.680 --> 48:32.874
How much for number three?

48:33.080 --> 48:33.717
Twenty an hour.

48:33.920 --> 48:36.753
<i>Thank you, Linda.
And now for the financial news.</i>

48:36.960 --> 48:39.599
Twenty, forty, sixty.

48:39.880 --> 48:40.995
Thank you much.

48:43.880 --> 48:44.949
Enjoy yourself.

48:49.360 --> 48:50.190
Come in.

49:04.560 --> 49:08.553
See what I mean, Laura?
Every so often, her rates go berserk.

49:13.720 --> 49:16.439
Fifty agents we got out there
looking for this guy.

49:17.200 --> 49:18.474
We got nothing.

49:19.240 --> 49:21.151
Man, how can you
just touch that?

49:21.680 --> 49:23.238
Occupational hazard.

49:27.760 --> 49:31.150
So, you didn't see nothing,
didn't hear nothing, don't know nothing?

49:31.360 --> 49:33.191
They come and they go.
You know what I mean?

49:33.400 --> 49:35.789
They come and they go.

49:36.040 --> 49:37.996
Oh, that's hysterical.
Sit your ass down.

49:38.200 --> 49:39.997
They come, they go.
You get it?

49:40.240 --> 49:42.037
Oh, yeah, I get it.
Here you go.

49:42.240 --> 49:42.990
Thanks.

51:10.560 --> 51:11.913
We're wasting time.

51:12.120 --> 51:14.588
It's been two days,
and Lennox hasn't made any headway.

51:14.800 --> 51:17.997
Maybe that's because you gentlemen
won't allow us to go public.

51:18.200 --> 51:19.155
Dr. Baker,

51:19.360 --> 51:21.920
you said that Eve
has telepathic abilities.

51:22.120 --> 51:22.950
Some.

51:23.160 --> 51:24.479
Can we send her after Patrick?

51:24.680 --> 51:27.035
It'd be foolish to take her
out of a controlled atmosphere.

51:27.320 --> 51:28.389
There's the danger of escape.

51:28.600 --> 51:31.398
Then we'd have two aliens loose,
instead of one.

51:31.600 --> 51:34.672
If these two were to mate, the resulting
pure strain of offspring...

51:34.880 --> 51:36.677
would be unstoppable.

51:36.880 --> 51:40.429
Well, can she tell us where he is
without leaving the lab?

51:41.840 --> 51:43.990
We've seen spiking
in her biorhythms...

51:44.200 --> 51:46.350
which indicate
a rudimentary connection...

51:46.560 --> 51:48.790
but half her alien genes
are dormant.

51:49.400 --> 51:52.233
Tracking Patrick
is out of her league.

51:52.720 --> 51:54.631
Dormant means asleep.

51:55.480 --> 51:58.119
Is there any way
that we can wake them up?

51:59.760 --> 52:01.751
We could use the lab's
cyclotron...

52:01.960 --> 52:04.872
to bombard her with radiation
that would awaken her dormant genes.

52:05.080 --> 52:06.433
But there is a problem.

52:06.640 --> 52:07.436
What's that?

52:07.640 --> 52:09.153
We make her more alien.

52:09.360 --> 52:11.237
We increase her strength,
her anger.

52:11.440 --> 52:13.431
Her mating drive
would go through the roof.

52:13.920 --> 52:15.433
It's worth the risk.
We'll tighten security.

52:15.640 --> 52:16.993
She is not a lab animal.

52:17.640 --> 52:18.993
She is half-human.

52:19.200 --> 52:21.919
Please, Baker, spare us
the alien rights agenda.

52:22.120 --> 52:23.189
Put her in the cyclotron.

52:23.520 --> 52:24.589
And what if I refuse?

52:25.120 --> 52:28.430
That's your prerogative.
She's gonna go in anyway.

52:28.640 --> 52:29.152
Gentlemen.

52:45.360 --> 52:46.998
Don't worry, Laura.

52:47.200 --> 52:48.553
I know what they want.

52:48.760 --> 52:53.072
I'm sorry. This is not what I intended.
It's gonna be very painful for you.

52:54.840 --> 52:56.034
I want to help.

52:57.040 --> 53:00.112
I'm going to radiate for 45 seconds
then shut it down.

53:37.720 --> 53:39.278
I'm connected, Laura.

53:40.600 --> 53:42.158
I see what he sees.

53:44.720 --> 53:47.029
<i>He's driving down a small street.</i>

53:47.240 --> 53:48.468
<i>I see two-story buildings...</i>

53:48.840 --> 53:50.592
<i>a man walking a small dog.</i>

53:51.360 --> 53:52.429
They're stopping at a stoplight.

53:52.960 --> 53:54.313
Okay, here we go!

53:54.960 --> 53:56.552
<i>I see street signs.</i>

53:59.320 --> 54:00.548
Gwynn's Falls and Warwick!

54:01.320 --> 54:03.356
- Intersection of Gwynn's Falls...
- He's in a parking lot!

54:03.880 --> 54:05.518
<i>- What?
- Gwynn's Falls and Warwick.</i>

54:05.720 --> 54:06.709
Gwynn's Falls?

54:06.920 --> 54:07.670
Where?

54:07.880 --> 54:09.154
That's in Reservoir Hill!

54:09.360 --> 54:10.918
There's a big supermarket!

54:11.120 --> 54:14.556
He's going into the supermarket
near Gwynn's Falls and Warwick.

54:15.200 --> 54:16.679
Hang on to your shorts!

54:32.400 --> 54:34.311
- He's going after a woman!
- Let's go!

54:36.000 --> 54:38.150
How the hell did you get
a drivers' license?

54:46.480 --> 54:47.674
Where is he?

54:48.240 --> 54:50.515
Aisle one. Fruits and vegetables!

54:50.720 --> 54:52.392
He's in aisle one,
fruits and vegetables.

55:24.160 --> 55:25.434
We're there. Now what?

55:27.040 --> 55:28.109
Come on, Press!

55:28.480 --> 55:30.550
My God! It's you!

55:31.280 --> 55:32.952
- Will you sign my Space Flakes box?
- Sure.

55:33.640 --> 55:34.470
You got a pen?

55:34.920 --> 55:36.194
I do.

55:37.520 --> 55:38.111
What's your name?

55:38.960 --> 55:39.597
Darlene.

55:40.280 --> 55:41.110
"Darlene."

55:42.840 --> 55:44.034
You know a secret?

55:44.640 --> 55:46.756
I think Space Flakes taste like shit.

55:48.000 --> 55:49.672
- Which row?
- Cereal!

55:51.480 --> 55:52.879
Come on, Press.

55:53.320 --> 55:54.275
Watch it!

55:54.920 --> 55:56.433
Where's the goddamn cereal?

55:56.640 --> 55:57.231
Nice to meet you.

55:57.440 --> 55:58.589
Really nice to meet you.

56:04.760 --> 56:05.272
It's her!

56:05.480 --> 56:07.311
Help me!

56:07.520 --> 56:08.589
Which way?

56:10.600 --> 56:11.874
Quick! Which way?

56:12.080 --> 56:12.796
What she say?

56:13.880 --> 56:15.438
They're going down some stairs.

56:15.640 --> 56:17.756
A basement! Find a basement!

56:26.080 --> 56:27.115
<i>It's dark.</i>

56:28.600 --> 56:29.749
He wants to mate with her!

56:37.200 --> 56:38.269
Get away!

56:49.440 --> 56:50.350
Get up!

56:52.320 --> 56:53.196
Shut up!

56:54.200 --> 56:55.349
Help!

56:57.280 --> 56:57.951
Get down!

57:11.560 --> 57:12.754
- Damn it!
- No!

57:15.360 --> 57:17.635
Help!

57:43.960 --> 57:44.995
He's trying to rape her!

58:05.840 --> 58:07.478
Man, don't shoot!

58:07.920 --> 58:08.875
Why don't you get a motel?

58:09.800 --> 58:10.949
Fuckin' kids.

58:14.280 --> 58:15.474
He knows I'm tapping in.

58:15.680 --> 58:18.478
Help! Leave me alone!
Stop!

58:19.040 --> 58:20.519
Get off me!

58:20.920 --> 58:21.432
Eve...

58:22.520 --> 58:23.191
Patrick!

58:31.760 --> 58:34.035
Go on! Get out of here!

58:35.040 --> 58:35.995
Get out!

58:55.680 --> 58:57.511
- Don't move, spaceman.
- Put down the gun.

58:58.680 --> 58:59.556
Get your hands up!

59:00.160 --> 59:01.195
Get 'em up!

59:02.360 --> 59:03.395
What is this?

59:04.080 --> 59:06.958
You can't deny some bugged-out stuff
going on around here.

59:07.800 --> 59:08.630
What kind of stuff?

59:09.320 --> 59:11.470
You told me yourself
you were feeling weird.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.070
You gotta go in for tests, bro.

59:16.120 --> 59:18.680
Sure. I don't mind
going into the lab.

59:34.040 --> 59:34.631
Open the gate.

59:42.400 --> 59:43.594
What's going on?

59:43.800 --> 59:46.598
Estrogen level's peaking.
It's like she's in heat.

59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.315
Let me out!

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:03.950
Let me out!

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:06.475
Let's go.

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:10.793
Has she been given
any medication?

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.115
Yes, her usual dose.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.355
Let me out, Laura!

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:14.788
I'm going to double it.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:15.910
Let me out!

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.475
Listen to me, Laura...

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:20.277
Laura!

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:07.992
Code 459 alert. Patrick Ross
in Biohazard Four. Seal the compound!

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:10.878
Get out of there, Sherry!

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.230
Patrick, leave her alone!

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:14.350
Open the door.

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:18.511
I know what you're going through,
and I can help you.

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.040
- Let me help you.
- Open the goddamn door.

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:23.836
I can't do that.

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:24.912
I'm sorry.

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:26.599
- Open it!
- I can't...

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:34.708
Get away from her now!

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.754
The proof is incontrovertible.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.754
Your son was infected
up in that capsule.

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.758
I'm sorry, Senator.

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:57.679
Jesus God.

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:01.069
Rest assured
we'll deal with this quietly.

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:03.669
Medical treatment, the best doctors.

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:05.199
The last thing this country needs

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:08.312
is a spectacle with a national hero
being publicly compromised.

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.438
Cut the crap, Carter.

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.359
What the hell are we gonna do?

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:15.988
Two imperatives:

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:19.112
We have to find Patrick
and bring him in immediately.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:23.518
We have to neutralize any possibility
that this could leak to the media.

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:25.995
The generals are very concerned.

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:29.120
They're gonna kill him, aren't they?

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:31.715
We need to find your son.

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:35.433
You listen to me,
you arrogant son-of-a-bitch.

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:37.552
If you touch a hair on his head...

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:39.792
you will rue the day you were born!

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.750
You make it very hard
to help you, Senator.

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.678
Go fuck yourself!

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:49.118
What the hell did you think I'd do?
Stand here and let you take my son?

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:53.669
I'll call the goddamn President
if I have to.

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:54.949
Listen carefully, old man.

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:58.080
This is way beyond the President.
Way beyond.

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:00.353
You wanna save Patrick?

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:02.838
Help us bring him in.

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:56.957
Damn, man! What is up?
I can't even get no play from an alien.

01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:00.956
Some people carry a disease
in their genetic code.

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:03.628
The possibility exists it might be
passed on to their children.

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:06.794
Those N.S.E.G. doctors
told me I had sickle trait.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.631
It's in your chart.
You don't have sickle-cell anemia,

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:12.354
which is why you were able
to go to Mars. But you're a carrier.

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:13.797
Right.

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:17.796
Well, I guess that's why
he didn't get infected up on the ship.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.117
Right. Alien DNA cannot cope
with human genetic flaws.

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:23.993
It has no defense against our diseases,
and that might be our answer.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:26.633
What could be the answer?

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:30.717
Alien DNA infected us.
It's about time we infected them.

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:33.110
What?

01:04:59.320 --> 01:04:59.877
Patrick...

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:03.954
Dad, what are you doing here?

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:08.315
I kind of figured
you'd show up here.

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:11.638
You always used to love this place
as a child.

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:14.954
So did your mother.

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.549
I never could convince her
to get rid of it.

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.715
Yeah, I used to come here
when I was courting her.

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.951
- And after she died...
- What do you want?

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.230
Well...

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.469
First off, I'd like to apologize.

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:35.549
Apologize for what?

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:37.676
Oh, Paddy.

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:39.556
Don't bother.

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:45.878
They told me what happened...

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:49.994
how you got infected up on Mars.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:54.793
I'm sorry, Paddy... for not listening
when you asked for help.

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:56.469
You never listened.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:00.399
I'm listening now.

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:13.708
They're gonna kill me.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.197
Not if I can help it.

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.350
Now, there's no way
that they can find you here.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.596
This property's still listed
under you mother's maiden name.

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:26.039
And I sure as hell am not gonna hand
you over to those Pentagon bastards.

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:27.190
No, sir.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:31.791
I'm taking you in to Johns Hopkins...
for treatment with the best.

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:33.919
We'll walk through that door together.

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.309
Come in with me, son.

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.270
No.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:49.397
I know you won't do it for me.

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:53.276
But try to think of your mother.

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:57.679
Do it for her.

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.434
Dad, help me.

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:14.429
It's okay.

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:18.629
It's okay.

01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:57.516
Eve...

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:15.474
We need your help again
to find Patrick.

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:20.832
I'm sorry, Laura.
I can't do that.

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:55.588
We could just call in
the National Guard.

01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:59.595
Sorry, pal.
This is strictly a private mission.

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:01.552
Yeah, well, I'm a lover.
I'm not a fighter.

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:03.109
You haven't been one of those

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:05.029
in 11 months.

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.713
Why you gotta bring that up?

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:10.515
Okay, I was a lover. I sure as hell
ain't no damned bounty hunter.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.718
This looks about right.

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:16.157
What?
That little, old tiny ass thing?

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:18.632
You ain't got
no bazookas up in here?

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:20.115
Bazookas?

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:22.716
Hasn't anyone ever told you
that size doesn't matter?

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:30.790
I mean, you can talk all that noise
if you want to.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.151
I'm taking this because I'm about
to go back to Africa on somebody's ass.

01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:41.113
I've used Dennis' blood sample
as the basis for this toxin.

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:46.989
Of course, I have no idea
whether or not this is going to work.

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:55.157
It's an interesting idea.
It might be the only chance we got.

01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:56.952
But what if it doesn't work?

01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.273
Well, then, my friend,

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:00.870
we're fucked.

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:22.636
Get the tether!

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:23.716
<i>Containment breach.</i>

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:26.195
We're locked in here!

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.595
<i>Electronic tether,
armed for activation</i>

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:31.075
<i>in five, four...</i>

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:33.995
<i>three, two, one.</i>

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:36.716
It's stuck.

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:43.111
Get back!

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:54.792
<i>Security breach, code red,
level four.</i>

01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.838
Colonel, there's a lot
of activity below.

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:02.235
Keep your distance.
Let's see what's going on.

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:22.511
Fire!

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.030
Come on.

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:12.797
Get in the humvees! Let's go! Now!

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:21.673
You heard him! Go!

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:25.391
How in the hell
does she know how to drive?

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.795
<i>Her favorite show's
The Dukes of Hazard.</i>

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.797
Fan-fuckin'-tastic.

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:43.714
<i>Burgess, this is General Metzger.</i>

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:47.151
<i>Maintain your pursuit
but do not engage alien escapee.</i>

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:50.238
<i>Let Press Lennox do his job.
Is that clear?</i>

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:52.829
Roger. Back off, Captain.

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:56.271
I don't wanna crash this party
until just the right time.

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:48.789
Stop right here.

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:51.632
Grab that spray canister.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.353
Be careful with that thing.

01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:26.511
Jesus Christ!

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:34.270
Welcome to the maternity ward...

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:35.629
from hell.

01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:37.910
Patrick's offspring.

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:42.670
I'm gonna go up and see if I can find
Adam and Eve.

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:46.472
Press, this isn't Eve's fault.
She's human too.

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:49.070
Like them.

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.720
What's wrong?
My DNA ain't good enough?

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:04.033
You let me live on that ship
so I can die in this goddamn barn?

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:07.318
Fuck you!
Fuck all you pig motherfuckers!

01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:09.995
I'm about to get straight
Kunta Kinte on your ass!

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:11.875
Dennis!

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:12.751
It's working!

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:17.071
Score one for human DNA, baby!

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:44.516
Why don't you get those?
I'm going up here.

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:46.199
Just do your thing, baby.

01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:01.551
Die!

01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:06.355
Thank you.

01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:07.996
You're welcome.

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:25.390
Eve, get out of the way!

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:38.038
What the hell is going on in here?

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:39.275
Stay back!

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:40.949
Oh, my God!

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:54.356
Eve, I know you're in there!
Please help us!

01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:55.755
Please, help us!

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:50.910
Press!

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:54.115
Get up! Quick!

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:55.277
Quick!

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.349
You killed her,

01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:15.710
you disgusting son-of-a-bitch!

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:17.353
Press, use my blood! Quick!

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:36.910
Get up!

01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:50.312
When did you start smoking?

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:51.555
Just now.

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:55.075
I wonder if I should have
this stuff analyzed.

01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:56.838
Yeah, maybe you should.

01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:59.793
You might turn into a sexual predator.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.639
- Yeah, I guess that's possible.
- It'd be okay with me.

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:04.034
I have a drag?

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.028
- All right, one, two, three.
- Up!

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:16.516
- Easy.
- Got it.

01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:30.512
Oh, now y'all show up...
after we do all the work.

01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:32.199
I wanna talk to the general.

01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:33.549
Know what I'm saying?

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.035
Mr. Gamble,

01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:37.517
I need you to lie back for me.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:41.190
- Yes, I'll be glad to.
- Nice and easy.

01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:43.879
Looks like you're gonna be all right.

01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:45.755
I'm fine, brother.

01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:47.356
Be seeing you.

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:51.913
I hear you had a rough day.

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:55.916
- Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
- Well.
