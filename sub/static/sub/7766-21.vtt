00:13.999 --> 00:16.999
- Coming up on the
"Vanderpump Rules" reunion...

00:16.999 --> 00:19.999
- Hi, Lisa.

00:19.999 --> 00:20.999
- Did you go back
and get my jewelry?

00:20.999 --> 00:22.999
- You know it's gonna
kick off at some point.

00:22.999 --> 00:24.000
- In her words.

00:24.999 --> 00:25.999
- Scheana, take some
f***ing responsibility.

00:25.999 --> 00:27.999
- You were being a dick.

00:27.999 --> 00:29.999
- It's gonna take every
bone in my body

00:29.999 --> 00:30.999
not to go after that guy.

00:30.999 --> 00:31.999
- I'm waiting for it, mate.

00:31.999 --> 00:33.999
- It's gonna happen.
It's gonna happen.

00:33.999 --> 00:34.999
- I'll punch you
in your fat throat, mate.

00:34.999 --> 00:36.999
Shut up.
- What is this?

00:36.999 --> 00:38.000
- Ow.

00:38.999 --> 00:39.999
- I wouldn't mind
being sedated for this.

00:39.999 --> 00:40.999
- Fireball sounds good.

00:40.999 --> 00:43.999
- I was furious
with him for lying to her.

00:43.999 --> 00:46.999
- It didn't
make things easier.

00:46.999 --> 00:48.999
- Had you known that he
had been to jail five times

00:48.999 --> 00:51.999
would you have
moved in with him?

00:51.999 --> 00:53.999
- You look scared.
- I am scared.

00:53.999 --> 00:55.999
I don't want
to get ganged up on.

00:55.999 --> 00:57.999
- She lied about it.
- I don't have time for that.

00:57.999 --> 01:02.999
- Are you listening?
Like, wake up.

01:02.999 --> 01:04.999
- Some people change,
some people never will.

01:04.999 --> 01:06.999
- I just want to
make sure that I'm heard.

01:06.999 --> 01:09.999
I'm trying to make
a f***ing point.

01:09.999 --> 01:10.999
- Just make it, sweetie.

01:10.999 --> 01:11.999
- I've been in
group settings with you.

01:11.999 --> 01:12.999
I've always been cordial.

01:12.999 --> 01:13.999
- We just ignore each other.

01:13.999 --> 01:16.999
- That's f***ing cordial.

01:16.999 --> 01:17.999
- You and Ken had gone
to my parents

01:17.999 --> 01:19.999
and told us "You owe me $900."

01:19.999 --> 01:21.999
- Really?
I was saving your ass.

01:21.999 --> 01:24.999
- Places please.
- Where did the hairspray go?

01:24.999 --> 01:25.999
- We're gonna be
doing the wide shot.

01:25.999 --> 01:27.999
5...

01:27.999 --> 01:28.999
- All right, we're doing this.
- 4...

01:28.999 --> 01:30.999
- Here we go.
- 3...

01:30.999 --> 01:31.999
- Can I see me again?

01:31.999 --> 01:32.999
- 2...

01:32.999 --> 01:33.999
- I love all of you,

01:33.999 --> 01:35.999
some of you
more than others.

01:35.999 --> 01:38.999
- Quiet, please!

01:39.999 --> 01:41.999
- ♪ Just raise
your glasses high ♪

01:41.999 --> 01:44.999
♪ This one's for you tonight ♪

01:44.999 --> 01:46.999
- Hey, everybody
and welcome to

01:46.999 --> 01:49.999
Sur Lounge in
West Hollywood, California,

01:49.999 --> 01:51.999
for the season four reunion

01:51.999 --> 01:52.999
of "Vanderpump Rules."

01:52.999 --> 01:53.999
I'm Andy Cohen

01:53.999 --> 01:57.999
here with the headmistress
of Sur, Lisa Vanderpump.

01:57.999 --> 01:59.999
- I'm dressed like
a headmistress today, right?

01:59.999 --> 02:01.999
- You are!

02:01.999 --> 02:02.999
- Yeah, I'm in that mode,
so be careful, all of you.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.999
- Lisa, seems like every
time I look on social media

02:05.999 --> 02:07.999
I see another
celebrity coming into

02:07.999 --> 02:08.999
one of the restaurants.

02:08.999 --> 02:10.999
You've had Gaga.
- Yeah.

02:10.999 --> 02:12.999
- Jennifer Lawrence.
- Yes.

02:12.999 --> 02:15.999
- I mean, and they are all
legitimately fans of this show.

02:15.999 --> 02:18.000
Chrissy Teigen--
I saw John Legend--

02:18.000 --> 02:19.999
- John Legend did.
That was beautiful.

02:19.999 --> 02:20.999
- Performing the theme song

02:20.999 --> 02:22.000
to "Vanderpump Rules"
on his Instagram.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.999
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He's a big fan.

02:24.999 --> 02:26.999
- Jax, it's
your fourth reunion.

02:26.999 --> 02:29.000
Although the first
for this nose, right?

02:30.999 --> 02:33.000
- I'm just--I'm just
a huge fan of Botox now.

02:33.999 --> 02:34.999
- Speaking of Botox,
hi, Scheana.

02:34.999 --> 02:35.999
- Hi.
- Excellent.

02:35.999 --> 02:36.999
- That's it.
How are you?

02:36.999 --> 02:38.000
- I'm fantastic.

02:38.999 --> 02:39.999
- You're wearing
the girls out today.

02:39.999 --> 02:41.999
- Yeah, figured if Lala
was covering them up,

02:41.999 --> 02:42.999
I could have them out.

02:42.999 --> 02:43.999
Nice.

02:43.999 --> 02:45.999
- Kristen.
- Hi.

02:45.999 --> 02:46.999
- Good to see you.

02:46.999 --> 02:47.999
- Did you just
look at mine too?

02:47.999 --> 02:48.999
- No, I did.
I'm sorry.

02:48.999 --> 02:50.999
Hey, Tom Sandoval.

02:50.999 --> 02:51.999
- Hey, what's up, Andy?

02:51.999 --> 02:53.999
- What do you call
this look today?

02:53.999 --> 02:54.999
- I would say if,
like, Don Johnson

02:54.999 --> 02:56.999
and Colonel Sanders had a baby.

02:56.999 --> 02:57.999
- Excellent.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.999
- Yeah.
- Excellent.

02:59.999 --> 03:00.999
Hi, Katie.
- Hi.

03:00.999 --> 03:01.999
- Big news for you this year.

03:01.999 --> 03:03.999
Congrats on the engagement.

03:03.999 --> 03:04.999
Let's see the ring again.

03:04.999 --> 03:05.999
- She needs help
holding it up.

03:05.999 --> 03:07.999
It's heavy.

03:07.999 --> 03:08.999
- It's so heavy.

03:08.999 --> 03:09.999
- Hi, Schwartz.
- Hey, Andy.

03:09.999 --> 03:11.999
I'm assuming you two have

03:11.999 --> 03:13.999
consummated the
engagement by now.

03:13.999 --> 03:14.999
- Almost.

03:14.999 --> 03:16.999
- We're working
our way up to it.

03:16.999 --> 03:17.999
- Hey, James.
- Hello.

03:17.999 --> 03:19.999
How are you?
- Great.

03:19.999 --> 03:20.999
Last time I saw
you our network censor

03:20.999 --> 03:23.999
nearly threw himself
out the window.

03:23.999 --> 03:24.999
- I don't understand where
she pulls that sh**

03:25.000 --> 03:25.999
out of her ass,
I really don't.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.999
- We're on live TV
so be careful.

03:27.999 --> 03:28.999
- Sorry.

03:28.999 --> 03:29.999
I'd probably f*** her, but--

03:29.999 --> 03:30.999
- Well, so would I.
- Again, we're on TV.

03:30.999 --> 03:31.999
- Oh, sh**.

03:31.999 --> 03:33.999
- Uh...
- Oh, no!

03:33.999 --> 03:34.999
- James, you're killing me.

03:34.999 --> 03:35.999
- Uh, apologize for that.

03:35.999 --> 03:37.999
- Hi, Lala.
- Hi, how are you?

03:37.999 --> 03:39.999
- How much liquid courage
have you had today?

03:39.999 --> 03:40.999
- Well, my mom's in town,

03:40.999 --> 03:43.999
so she was like
"The last time we had that

03:43.999 --> 03:44.999
"it didn't go so well,

03:44.999 --> 03:45.999
so let's go sober."

03:45.999 --> 03:48.999
- Right.
And, Ariana, hey!

03:48.999 --> 03:49.999
- Hey.
- How's it going?

03:49.999 --> 03:51.999
You look gorgeous.
- Good, oh, thank you.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.999
I can see your eyes.
- Sorry.

03:54.999 --> 03:57.999
This year was as twisty
and unpredictable as ever.

03:57.999 --> 04:01.999
Has anyone's status changed
since the engagement party?

04:01.999 --> 04:04.999
- Well, James is right
now suspended from Pump.

04:04.999 --> 04:05.999
- James.
- You know.

04:05.999 --> 04:07.999
- Did you get drunk
at Pump again?

04:07.999 --> 04:08.999
- Yeah, you know,
it's been a--

04:08.999 --> 04:10.999
it's been problem for me.

04:10.999 --> 04:11.999
- Well, it's been
a problem for me, actually.

04:11.999 --> 04:12.999
- Yeah, it's been
a problem for Lisa as well.

04:12.999 --> 04:14.999
- Yeah, you were fine.

04:14.999 --> 04:15.999
- Yeah, you know,
I'm honestly trying to

04:15.999 --> 04:17.999
again do better
with that whole thing

04:17.999 --> 04:20.999
and this year, you know,
it's a new year, 2016,

04:20.999 --> 04:22.999
and, you know,
I'm ready to do a lot better.

04:22.999 --> 04:25.999
- Lisa, how hard is it
to employ two people

04:25.999 --> 04:28.999
who hate each other
as much as Jax and James?

04:28.999 --> 04:29.999
- Listen, I think
it's a shame,

04:29.999 --> 04:31.999
but if you look at
this group,

04:31.999 --> 04:34.999
all of them at some
time hate each other.

04:34.999 --> 04:35.999
- I don't hate Jax.
I don't.

04:35.999 --> 04:36.999
- But--no, no, no,
when there are this--

04:36.999 --> 04:38.999
- You've said some things
that were below the belt.

04:38.999 --> 04:39.999
- I've said
very hurtful things.

04:39.999 --> 04:42.999
- Jax, what is it about James
that bothers you the most?

04:42.999 --> 04:44.999
- You know, it's--
his mouth, man.

04:44.999 --> 04:46.999
You know, as much as I...

04:46.999 --> 04:49.999
God, as much as I want
to hurt you, and I do.

04:49.999 --> 04:50.999
I want to hurt you
really bad.

04:52.999 --> 04:55.999
Thank God for you that
I'm on probation, but...

04:55.999 --> 04:57.999
- I know.
I'm milking it, too, buddy.

04:57.999 --> 05:00.999
- One of the most surprising
things that we saw this season

05:00.999 --> 05:04.999
was not only
that Jax		 has		 a mom,

05:04.999 --> 05:06.999
but that she's really sweet.

05:06.999 --> 05:08.999
Lisa, what did you think
about meeting the woman

05:08.999 --> 05:10.999
who created this?

05:10.999 --> 05:12.999
- Well, I was surprised,
actually,

05:12.999 --> 05:14.999
that she kind of has such
a great sense of humor about it.

05:14.999 --> 05:16.000
- Right.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.999
- I feel like she has to
at this point.

05:17.999 --> 05:19.999
- In the premiere,
you seemed to brag to your mom

05:19.999 --> 05:21.999
that you stole wine from Lisa

05:21.999 --> 05:23.999
and silverware from Sur.

05:23.999 --> 05:25.000
- You want a glass of wine?

05:25.999 --> 05:26.999
- Did you take this
or was this a gift?

05:26.999 --> 05:29.999
- Lisa may or may not know
that I have this bottle.

05:29.999 --> 05:32.999
All this silverware is from Sur.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.999
Come on,
I'm not the only one here

05:34.999 --> 05:35.999
who's taken liquor
or silverware...

05:36.000 --> 05:37.999
- Don't forget
about toilet paper.

05:37.999 --> 05:38.999
- Toilet paper.
- Yeah, you are.

05:38.999 --> 05:40.999
- Jax, I mean,
I can't defend him

05:40.999 --> 05:41.999
because he is a bad dog.

05:41.999 --> 05:42.999
- I don't want you to defend me.
- He is a bad dog.

05:42.999 --> 05:44.999
But he's been
a really good employee,

05:44.999 --> 05:46.999
and you know
one thing about Jax,

05:46.999 --> 05:48.999
he's always been
amazing to me.

05:48.999 --> 05:52.999
So, yeah, he's an ass****,
but he's a nice ass**** to me.

05:52.999 --> 05:56.999
- Scheana, your decades party
looked like a lot of fun.

05:56.999 --> 05:58.999
Kristen,
Scheana made it very clear

05:58.999 --> 06:00.999
that you were not invited
to that party,

06:00.999 --> 06:01.999
yet you went anyway.

06:01.999 --> 06:02.999
- Shocking.

06:02.999 --> 06:04.999
- Did you ever consider
not going to Scheana's party?

06:04.999 --> 06:06.999
- No.
- No.

06:06.999 --> 06:08.999
Does it mean anything
to you ever

06:08.999 --> 06:11.999
if someone says, "No, you can't
come to this place"?

06:11.999 --> 06:15.999
- Thus far, no, not really.

06:15.999 --> 06:17.999
- Lisa, you and Ken asked
James about his drinking

06:17.999 --> 06:19.999
the moment you walked
in the door.

06:19.999 --> 06:20.999
- Are you gonna have a drink?

06:20.999 --> 06:22.999
- The question is is
are you gonna have a drink?

06:22.999 --> 06:24.999
- I've had two already.

06:24.999 --> 06:28.999
Why were you concerned?

06:28.999 --> 06:32.999
Alcohol with James,
it's like he just changes,

06:32.999 --> 06:33.999
and I just see him.

06:33.999 --> 06:35.999
He gets
that look in his eye

06:35.999 --> 06:37.999
and all bets are off.

06:37.999 --> 06:39.999
- Why did you drink
so much that night

06:39.999 --> 06:41.999
knowing that
all eyes were on you?

06:41.999 --> 06:43.999
- At the time, yeah, you think
you're doing something cool,

06:43.999 --> 06:45.999
but then watching
it back it wasn't so cool.

06:45.999 --> 06:46.999
- Wha--

06:46.999 --> 06:48.999
Dude, that was
so hilarious, man.

06:48.999 --> 06:51.999
I laughed my ass off.

06:51.999 --> 06:54.999
- Oh, my God.
- James!

06:54.999 --> 06:55.999
- James!
- Oh, my God, James!

06:55.999 --> 06:57.999
James!

06:57.999 --> 06:58.999
- James, James, no, no, James.
- Holy sh**, dude.

06:58.999 --> 07:00.999
- What?

07:00.999 --> 07:03.999
Yeah, I mean, given
Fireball is delicious,

07:03.999 --> 07:04.999
so it was pretty easy
for me to drink that.

07:04.999 --> 07:06.999
However, you know,
it wasn't a good look

07:06.999 --> 07:09.999
and won't be face chugging
the bottle anymore.

07:09.999 --> 07:10.999
- Well, weren't you
double-fisting it?

07:11.000 --> 07:12.999
Wasn't he kind of doing
something like that?

07:12.999 --> 07:14.999
- Yeah, actually Shay
was the one double-fisting.

07:14.999 --> 07:15.999
- Shay was the one that...
- Yeah.

07:15.999 --> 07:17.999
- I only had one
good old fist on it.

07:17.999 --> 07:21.999
- The morning after
you got sh**-canned

07:21.999 --> 07:23.999
at Scheana's party,

07:23.999 --> 07:24.999
Kristen discovered

07:24.999 --> 07:27.999
the smoking gun Uber receipt.

07:27.999 --> 07:29.999
- Yes, she did.
- Yes.

07:29.999 --> 07:32.999
Which led her to believe
that you had cheated on her.

07:32.999 --> 07:33.999
How did you get that receipt?

07:33.999 --> 07:35.999
- His laptop was on my bed,

07:35.999 --> 07:37.999
and his email was open.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.999
So I went through it,
typed in Uber, nothing.

07:40.999 --> 07:41.999
- Dude...

07:41.999 --> 07:42.999
- Go to "all mail"
which includes your trash,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.999
and he deleted it,
and I found it.

07:45.999 --> 07:46.999
- Guys at home,
are you listening?

07:46.999 --> 07:48.999
- Yeah, Kris is a detective.
She can find anything.

07:48.999 --> 07:49.999
- MacGyver,
female MacGyver.

07:49.999 --> 07:50.999
- Anything.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.999
- Just curious,
when you saw that episode,

07:52.999 --> 07:55.999
and he says,
"I didn't do it, babe,"

07:55.999 --> 07:57.999
cut to him in an interview.
- To him going--oh...

07:57.999 --> 07:58.999
- When he says,
"I banged her. I banged her."

07:58.999 --> 08:00.999
- Promise you I didn't
have sex with her.

08:00.999 --> 08:02.999
I've never had sex
with anybody but you

08:02.999 --> 08:05.999
in the whole relationship we've
been together or not together.

08:05.999 --> 08:06.999
The truth is, you know,

08:06.999 --> 08:09.999
Jenna and I
were definitely boning.

08:09.999 --> 08:12.999
- Watching him just be,
like, such a dick,

08:12.999 --> 08:15.999
just so outwardly, like,
not caring whatsoever,

08:15.999 --> 08:18.999
and thinking how it's almost
like it's funny to him

08:18.999 --> 08:19.999
like, that he got away
with it or, like,

08:19.999 --> 08:21.999
that he did achieve that.

08:21.999 --> 08:24.999
Like, congratulations, like one
more notch on your bedpost.

08:24.999 --> 08:25.999
It's gross.

08:25.999 --> 08:26.999
- "Boning" is
such an ugly world.

08:26.999 --> 08:29.999
Why not say,
"We were making love"?

08:29.999 --> 08:32.999
- Right. You know what,
with all due respect,

08:32.999 --> 08:34.999
I have a feeling they were
boning and not making love.

08:34.999 --> 08:37.999
Is there any of
your behavior that you saw

08:37.999 --> 08:39.999
that you thought, "Oh, I wish
I hadn't have done that"?

08:39.999 --> 08:42.999
- Obviously there is,
you know, countless of times.

08:42.999 --> 08:43.999
But I'm working on
bettering myself,

08:43.999 --> 08:45.999
you know,
I really am.

08:45.999 --> 08:46.999
- No, you're really not.
- Okay.

08:46.999 --> 08:50.999
No one asked you, Kristen.
God.

08:50.999 --> 08:52.999
- We saw James
and Kristen break up

08:53.000 --> 08:55.999
at the site of many
a heart-to-heart,

08:55.999 --> 08:57.999
the back alley of Sur.

08:57.999 --> 08:58.999
- I don't want
to be with you.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.999
- I don't want
to be with you anymore.

09:01.999 --> 09:02.999
- Then we're good.

09:02.999 --> 09:03.999
- See this?

09:03.999 --> 09:05.999
You're never gonna
have it ever again.

09:05.999 --> 09:07.999
- Kristen, why did you
go to Sur that night?

09:07.999 --> 09:10.999
- I got home
to a note on my car

09:10.999 --> 09:11.999
calling me a nasty slut.

09:11.999 --> 09:12.999
It was just like,

09:12.999 --> 09:14.999
"Get out of my life.
I'm done."

09:14.999 --> 09:17.999
- James, you accused Kristen
of having cheating on you--

09:17.999 --> 09:18.999
- Multiple times, yeah.

09:18.999 --> 09:19.999
You know,
her phone would go off,

09:19.999 --> 09:20.999
she'd go to the Hollywood Hills,
get her bang on,

09:20.999 --> 09:22.999
come back down an hour later,
you know?

09:22.999 --> 09:24.999
She'd come home
where her f***ing face

09:24.999 --> 09:25.999
was smellin' awful,

09:25.999 --> 09:27.999
so, you know--
- You are so full of sh**.

09:27.999 --> 09:28.999
And you didn't live with me
so I didn't come--

09:28.999 --> 09:30.999
- I'd have Scheana's friends
coming up to me

09:30.999 --> 09:31.999
at the bar at Pump telling
me that you're making out,

09:31.999 --> 09:33.999
sitting on boys laps
every five minutes at the clubs.

09:33.999 --> 09:34.999
- I'm sick being in the same
room with him, I'm trying to--

09:34.999 --> 09:36.999
- I always find out
more and more people

09:36.999 --> 09:37.999
that Kristen slept
with while we were together.

09:37.999 --> 09:39.999
- I could say the same thing.
I could say the same thing.

09:39.999 --> 09:40.999
- And I guarantee you,
James, as time goes on,

09:40.999 --> 09:42.999
you are gonna find out more
people that Kristen slept with.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.999
- Of course I will.
- I would f--I--Oh, my...

09:44.999 --> 09:45.999
Why are you defending James,
Tom?

09:45.999 --> 09:46.999
- It's what certain
people are capable of!

09:46.999 --> 09:48.999
- Why do you care?
Coming to the defense of James?

09:48.999 --> 09:50.999
- It's not defending, it's--
- It's f***ed up!

09:50.999 --> 09:51.999
- James,
if I cheated on you,

09:51.999 --> 09:56.999
I would shout it from
a f***ing top of a mountain.

09:56.999 --> 09:57.999
- Coming up...

09:57.999 --> 09:59.999
- We saw you
whisper in her ear,

09:59.999 --> 10:01.999
lean over there saying,
"I'd like to f*** you

10:01.999 --> 10:03.999
right here in
front of everybody."

10:03.999 --> 10:05.999
- I'm sorry,
am I denying anything?

10:05.999 --> 10:06.999
- No, no.

10:15.999 --> 10:16.999
Well, Lisa,
let me ask you this,

10:16.999 --> 10:20.999
some have accused James of
applying for a job at Sur

10:20.999 --> 10:22.999
to get on the show.

10:22.999 --> 10:23.999
Where do you stand in this?

10:23.999 --> 10:25.999
- Well, it was actually--
I had dinner with--

10:25.999 --> 10:26.999
- He said that.

10:26.999 --> 10:28.999
- Kristen,
I can answer for myself.

10:28.999 --> 10:29.999
I don't need your help.

10:29.999 --> 10:31.999
I had dinner with his parents

10:31.999 --> 10:33.999
and his mother
actually asked me

10:33.999 --> 10:34.999
"Can he have a job?"

10:34.999 --> 10:35.999
He was--I mean, this was, what?

10:35.999 --> 10:36.999
Three years ago.

10:36.999 --> 10:38.999
He was little,
a pip-squeak, really.

10:38.999 --> 10:40.999
And I said,
"Well, maybe I could

10:40.999 --> 10:42.999
give him a job as a busser."

10:42.999 --> 10:44.999
- You know, Andy,
I will say in my defense

10:44.999 --> 10:46.999
that no one can
just come in here,

10:46.999 --> 10:48.999
get a job,
and stroll onto the show.

10:48.999 --> 10:49.999
- Well, Jax,
do you think that James

10:49.999 --> 10:50.999
had feelings for Kristen

10:50.999 --> 10:52.999
or do you think
he was using her

10:52.999 --> 10:53.999
to get on the show?

10:53.999 --> 10:55.000
- Yeah, that's what I think.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.999
I mean,
it was little bit of both.

10:56.999 --> 10:57.999
I think he was trying
to get on the show

10:57.999 --> 10:58.999
and I think she was
trying to get back at Tom.

10:58.999 --> 11:00.999
- No, my first relationship that

11:01.000 --> 11:02.999
was pursued here was Tom.

11:02.999 --> 11:04.999
He invited me to a gig,

11:04.999 --> 11:06.999
and obviously as time went
on Kristen and I got closer

11:06.999 --> 11:08.999
and that's how that all started,
you know?

11:08.999 --> 11:09.999
- I don't believe it.

11:09.999 --> 11:10.999
- I wanted to create a
friendship

11:10.999 --> 11:11.999
with buddies around me at work.

11:11.999 --> 11:12.999
- A friendship with Tom
isn't gonna get him

11:12.999 --> 11:15.999
a big spot on the show
in the third season.

11:15.999 --> 11:17.999
- Do you think that he pursued
you to get on the show?

11:17.999 --> 11:18.999
- Guys, look--
- Yes.

11:18.999 --> 11:20.999
- Kristen, fine, all right.
If I used you then you used me.

11:20.999 --> 11:21.999
- You guys used each other.

11:21.999 --> 11:22.999
I mean, if there was
one person--

11:22.999 --> 11:23.999
- I used him to get over you,

11:23.999 --> 11:24.999
and he used me
to get on the show.

11:24.999 --> 11:26.999
- No, no, no, it wasn't
just that, Kristen.

11:26.999 --> 11:28.999
Like, me and James were getting
ready to move in together

11:28.999 --> 11:30.999
and you were like, "Who's the
one person I can f***

11:30.999 --> 11:32.999
to throw a wrench
in Tom's spoke?"

11:33.000 --> 11:34.999
- So...you think I literally--
- Let's be f***ing real here.

11:34.999 --> 11:36.999
- That is so real.

11:36.999 --> 11:37.999
- She just said she used
him to get back at you.

11:37.999 --> 11:39.999
- I didn't care.
I didn't care.

11:39.999 --> 11:40.999
I didn't care about you either
way, you know what I mean?

11:40.999 --> 11:42.999
- Did you do it
to get back at Tom?

11:42.999 --> 11:44.999
- Yeah.
- Not back at him, get over him.

11:44.999 --> 11:45.999
And it worked.
- No, no, no, no.

11:45.999 --> 11:47.999
- It was also meanwhile
while you were, like,

11:47.999 --> 11:49.999
squatting in his apartment
and you wouldn't leave.

11:49.999 --> 11:50.999
- For two months.
- Our apartment.

11:50.999 --> 11:52.999
- Wouldn't leave.
- It was our apartment.

11:52.999 --> 11:53.999
- It's his apartment.
He's lived there for ten years.

11:53.999 --> 11:55.999
- Even Tom had
to leave his own apartment.

11:55.999 --> 11:56.999
- It's not "our apartment."

11:56.999 --> 11:57.999
- Well, when we lived there for

11:57.999 --> 11:58.999
four years together,
it is our apartment.

11:58.999 --> 11:59.999
- He asked you to move out
for two months,

11:59.999 --> 12:01.999
and you were still there.

12:01.999 --> 12:02.999
- On the show,
you gave a list of things

12:02.999 --> 12:05.999
that you had done for James.
- Everything.

12:05.999 --> 12:06.999
- Paying for his meals,
buying his clothes.

12:06.999 --> 12:08.999
What else did you do for him?

12:08.999 --> 12:09.999
- I mean, literally everything.

12:09.999 --> 12:12.999
I mean, he didn't spend a dime
since the day I met him.

12:12.999 --> 12:14.999
He lived with me
for a little while, like...

12:14.999 --> 12:18.999
- Hey, there's a reason
I'm dating a cougar, all right?

12:18.999 --> 12:20.999
Wanted a bit of
a sugar mama, f*** it.

12:20.999 --> 12:23.999
- Sur is a rotating door

12:23.999 --> 12:26.000
of fascinating
and beautiful people.

12:26.999 --> 12:28.999
This year Lala walked in.

12:28.999 --> 12:29.999
How did you get your job?

12:29.999 --> 12:32.999
- It was--like anyone will say,
it's kind of a family,

12:32.999 --> 12:36.999
so the second I moved out here
my friend Dani Shay said,

12:36.999 --> 12:38.999
come in to Sur
and see if you can get a job.

12:38.999 --> 12:41.999
I had never had a real job
before I moved out here.

12:41.999 --> 12:44.999
So I moved
into Stassi's room

12:44.999 --> 12:48.999
and then my roommate moved out
and Dani Shay moved in.

12:48.999 --> 12:49.999
- You're in my room, right?
- Yes.

12:49.999 --> 12:51.999
- I want to see your room.
- Okay.

12:51.999 --> 12:53.999
- Oh, my gosh.
- Is it?

12:53.999 --> 12:55.999
- Again, it looks so much better
than when I had it.

12:55.999 --> 12:57.999
- I'm beginning to
think L.A. isn't that big.

12:57.999 --> 12:59.999
- No, it's tiny.
It's smaller than Salt Lake.

12:59.999 --> 13:00.999
It's the weirdest thing.
- Yeah.

13:00.999 --> 13:02.999
You are from Utah.
- Mm-hmm.

13:02.999 --> 13:04.999
- You're from Utah.
- Yeah.

13:04.999 --> 13:06.999
- Yet the two
of you didn't really

13:06.999 --> 13:09.999
become Utah sisters
right away.

13:09.999 --> 13:11.999
- No, and truthfully,
I mean, I had had

13:11.999 --> 13:13.999
like, maybe a couple
conversations with her,

13:13.999 --> 13:16.999
but in those conversations
I didn't really

13:16.999 --> 13:19.999
get a sense that she was
even trying to be a friend.

13:19.999 --> 13:22.999
- Schwartz, the first time
you met Lala,

13:22.999 --> 13:25.999
she told you that she was
going to a shoot in Italy.

13:25.999 --> 13:27.999
- Yeah.
- As a mactor...

13:27.999 --> 13:30.999
- Yes.
- Did that smell fishy to you?

13:30.999 --> 13:32.999
- I got to say
I'm the one that

13:32.999 --> 13:34.000
called that sh** out
immediately.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.999
I was like, dude,
no, no, no, no, no.

13:35.999 --> 13:37.999
Unless you're Kate Moss
they're not gonna fly...

13:37.999 --> 13:39.999
- Not that Lala's
not gorgeous, but, like,

13:39.999 --> 13:40.999
to go--if you're
getting sent to Italy,

13:40.999 --> 13:41.999
you're a very high-end model.

13:41.999 --> 13:44.999
- Lisa, everyone seemed
very offended

13:44.999 --> 13:46.999
that Lala lied to you.

13:46.999 --> 13:48.999
- I think Katie and Scheana
were being protective

13:48.999 --> 13:52.999
and thought, "Hey, we're calling
you out on your nonsense."

13:52.999 --> 13:53.999
- It's like,
made such a big deal.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.000
I'm like it's not
that big of a deal.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.999
- Lala, how many times--
- Yeah, but making it--

13:56.999 --> 13:57.999
- I'm talking to Andy.

13:57.999 --> 13:59.999
- Lala, how many times have

13:59.999 --> 14:01.999
rich guys flown you
to exotic places?

14:01.999 --> 14:03.999
- I've lost count.

14:03.999 --> 14:05.999
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:05.999 --> 14:07.999
I've never slept
with any of them.

14:07.999 --> 14:08.999
- So what do you do?

14:08.999 --> 14:11.999
- We just go, a bunch
of friends, and have fun.

14:11.999 --> 14:13.999
I mean, I don't see
what the big deal is.

14:13.999 --> 14:16.999
No one's spread--well,
I'm not spreading my legs.

14:16.999 --> 14:18.999
- The implication
was that you were

14:18.999 --> 14:21.999
banging an older guy
for a trip to Italy.

14:21.999 --> 14:23.999
- Yeah, right, which--
- How did you respond to that?

14:23.999 --> 14:27.999
- I definitely--watching it,
I see how it looks.

14:27.999 --> 14:29.999
- We're you irritated by
any of Scheana's commentary?

14:29.999 --> 14:31.999
- And you kind of led
with your sexuality.

14:31.999 --> 14:33.999
And it's like the guy
equivalent of saying

14:33.999 --> 14:35.999
"I have a big dick" upon first--
- "I'm a badass."

14:35.999 --> 14:37.999
Immediately when you hear that,
you're like "pussy."

14:37.999 --> 14:39.999
- If she says she's not
sleeping with any of them

14:39.999 --> 14:40.999
that's her business.

14:40.999 --> 14:41.999
- I'm not, and guess what,
if I were sleeping

14:41.999 --> 14:43.999
with one of them,
I would wear it with pride.

14:43.999 --> 14:44.999
I'm not.

14:44.999 --> 14:46.999
I'm the one not getting
laid on the trip.

14:46.999 --> 14:48.999
- Well, Jax, it seemed
like you and Lala were

14:48.999 --> 14:51.999
destined to get together
from the beginning.

14:51.999 --> 14:54.999
What attracted you
to her at first?

14:54.999 --> 14:57.999
- Oh, it was just fun,
flirtatious stuff.

14:57.999 --> 14:58.999
Whatever.
I mean, it's just typical...

14:58.999 --> 14:59.999
- Boobs.
- Boobs.

14:59.999 --> 15:01.000
- She has a vagina.
- Boobs.

15:01.999 --> 15:02.999
- Vagina.
- She has a pulse.

15:02.999 --> 15:04.999
What it is
is when there's

15:04.999 --> 15:07.999
a new conquest
that walks into Sur--

15:07.999 --> 15:09.999
and that's exactly
what she is.

15:09.999 --> 15:10.999
Look at her.
- That look on his face.

15:10.999 --> 15:12.999
- He wants to try
and conquer.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.999
I've seen him do it
so many times.

15:15.999 --> 15:19.999
- But I feel like Jax and
I are kind of, like, the same.

15:19.999 --> 15:21.999
Like, we're similar,
because when someone--

15:21.999 --> 15:22.999
- Oh, God forbid, Lala.
Please.

15:22.999 --> 15:24.999
- But when I see someone new
it's, like, fun.

15:24.999 --> 15:25.999
- No, it's--it's true.

15:25.999 --> 15:26.999
- It's a challenge and you flirt

15:26.999 --> 15:29.999
and I didn't think that he was
trying to start a relationship

15:29.999 --> 15:31.999
in any way, shape, or form,

15:31.999 --> 15:33.999
but it was fun to flirt
at the beginning.

15:33.999 --> 15:36.999
- Lala, it seemed
like Jax forgot that

15:36.999 --> 15:38.999
his girlfriend Brittany existed.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.999
- I wouldn't say I forgot,
I would just say I...

15:41.999 --> 15:43.999
- Misplaced it?
- I put her on the back shelf.

15:43.999 --> 15:44.999
- You said that
you guys were on a break.

15:44.999 --> 15:46.999
- I wouldn't say I forgot.

15:46.999 --> 15:47.999
- So how's this
girlfriend of yours?

15:47.999 --> 15:49.999
- Let's easy with
that word girlfriend.

15:49.999 --> 15:50.999
Chill on that.
Pump the breaks.

15:50.999 --> 15:51.999
- Pump the breaks
on the girlfriend.

15:51.999 --> 15:52.999
- Pump the breaks
on that word.

15:52.999 --> 15:53.999
That's a scary word for me.

15:53.999 --> 15:54.999
Are we dating?
Absolutely.

15:54.999 --> 15:56.999
Would I call her
a girlfriend yet?

15:56.999 --> 15:57.999
No.

15:57.999 --> 15:58.999
- He denies it.

15:58.999 --> 16:00.999
Look, we saw you
whisper in her ear,

16:00.999 --> 16:01.999
lean over there saying...

16:01.999 --> 16:02.999
- I don't believe
I'm arguing with you.

16:02.999 --> 16:03.999
- "I'd like to f*** you right

16:03.999 --> 16:04.999
here in front of everybody."

16:04.999 --> 16:05.999
You cannot deny that.

16:05.999 --> 16:07.999
And you were in
a committed relationship.

16:07.999 --> 16:09.999
- I'm sorry,
am I denying anything?

16:09.999 --> 16:10.999
- Well, you were trying
to minimize it.

16:10.999 --> 16:11.999
- I'm not minimizing it.

16:11.999 --> 16:14.999
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.999
- Lala, what did you think
Jax's relationship status was

16:17.999 --> 16:19.999
when you were
flirting with him?

16:19.999 --> 16:21.999
- I thought single
was his status.

16:21.999 --> 16:23.999
- And where would you
get that impression from?

16:23.999 --> 16:24.999
- From him.

16:24.999 --> 16:25.999
- There you go.

16:25.999 --> 16:27.999
- Katie, this is
a tight group of friends.

16:27.999 --> 16:29.999
Any advice for newbies trying
to break into the circle?

16:29.999 --> 16:31.999
- I mean, I know it
can be very intimidating

16:31.999 --> 16:33.999
and hard to penetrate.

16:33.999 --> 16:34.999
There's a lot of history.

16:34.999 --> 16:35.999
People have known a lot--

16:35.999 --> 16:36.999
known each other
a lot of the time...

16:36.999 --> 16:38.999
- I think "penetrate"
being the operative word.

16:38.999 --> 16:41.999
Right, James?
- My mind is really running.

16:41.999 --> 16:43.999
- Well, Lala,
it seems like Sur was not

16:43.999 --> 16:45.999
totally welcoming to you.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.999
What are some of the ways
that you felt excluded?

16:48.999 --> 16:52.999
- It's intimidating coming
into a group like this.

16:52.999 --> 16:54.999
- But also the issue, too, is
then you're going around saying,

16:54.999 --> 16:55.999
like, I'm, like,
"bullying" you.

16:55.999 --> 16:57.999
Like, I have two conversations--

16:57.999 --> 16:58.999
- I have never said you were
bullying me in my life.

16:58.999 --> 17:00.999
- Why did Lisa seem
to think that?

17:00.999 --> 17:02.999
- Lisa, did I ever say
to you "I'm being bullied"?

17:02.999 --> 17:04.999
- I think you felt excluded.

17:04.999 --> 17:05.999
- There's a...
- I...

17:05.999 --> 17:07.999
- I have never used the word
"bully" in my life.

17:07.999 --> 17:08.999
- But I was also never mean
to you once.

17:08.999 --> 17:10.999
- Well, I felt,
I felt, yeah.

17:10.999 --> 17:12.999
When you over there about
the whole thing with Italy...

17:12.999 --> 17:13.999
- Right.

17:13.999 --> 17:16.999
- You did kind of give her
very much a hard time.

17:16.999 --> 17:18.999
- We were joking,
and you knew that.

17:18.999 --> 17:20.999
There--we had several
conversations before that.

17:20.999 --> 17:21.999
- No, I don't think
you two are bullies.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.000
- That was just
us calling her out.

17:23.999 --> 17:24.999
- I don't think
you two are bullies,

17:24.999 --> 17:25.999
but I don't think
you were that welcoming.

17:25.999 --> 17:28.999
And what I saw
about Lala was very different

17:28.999 --> 17:29.999
from what you saw.

17:29.999 --> 17:30.999
- I know, but why the tears?

17:30.999 --> 17:31.999
Why the breaking down when

17:31.999 --> 17:33.999
I hadn't talked to you,
like, two times

17:33.999 --> 17:34.999
and was never mean to you?

17:34.999 --> 17:36.999
- I didn't break down 'cause
of just you, baby girl,

17:36.999 --> 17:40.999
so don't give yourself
that much credit.

17:40.999 --> 17:41.999
Coming up...

17:41.999 --> 17:42.999
- I had one choice,

17:42.999 --> 17:45.999
f***ing choose Scheana
or choose drugs.

17:57.999 --> 17:59.999
and her band of Sur servers.

17:59.999 --> 18:01.999
And we're joined
by Michael Shay

18:01.999 --> 18:04.999
for his first
reunion appearance.

18:04.999 --> 18:05.999
How you doing, Shay?
- Great.

18:05.999 --> 18:06.999
- Great to see you.
- Oh!

18:06.999 --> 18:07.999
- Yay, Shay!

18:07.999 --> 18:08.999
- You look good.
- Thank you.

18:08.999 --> 18:11.999
- Maybe because
we don't see that much of you

18:11.999 --> 18:13.999
or we see
how happy Scheana is,

18:14.000 --> 18:16.999
it was a surprise
to all of us to hear

18:16.999 --> 18:18.999
that you were struggling

18:18.999 --> 18:21.999
with some pretty serious
addiction issues.

18:21.999 --> 18:22.999
- Instead of paying
bills some months,

18:22.999 --> 18:25.999
he would just buy pills.

18:25.999 --> 18:29.999
I have been so, so miserable

18:29.999 --> 18:31.999
and lonely
this past week.

18:31.999 --> 18:32.999
Like, thank God I have
the most amazing friends.

18:32.999 --> 18:35.999
- I have been so miserable
and lonely for two years.

18:35.999 --> 18:39.999
It started before
we had started dating,

18:39.999 --> 18:42.999
and it was just a, like, a
sports injury and then it just--

18:42.999 --> 18:44.999
- What were you taking?
- Vicodin.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.999
- How many were you
taking a day?

18:47.999 --> 18:50.999
- I would average,
like, five or six or something.

18:50.999 --> 18:53.999
- Scheana, did you know
that this was going on?

18:53.999 --> 18:56.999
- I didn't know
it was an every day thing.

18:56.999 --> 18:59.999
It just seemed like
that was just his poison

18:59.999 --> 19:02.999
he would occasionally
pick recreationally.

19:02.999 --> 19:03.999
- But wasn't he lethargic?

19:03.999 --> 19:05.999
Wasn't he just
on another planet?

19:05.999 --> 19:06.999
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-mm.

19:06.999 --> 19:08.999
No, because your body
gets immune to something

19:08.999 --> 19:09.999
once you have it all day.

19:09.999 --> 19:11.999
Then you need it
to function,

19:11.999 --> 19:13.999
so it's like if
he didn't take it

19:13.999 --> 19:14.999
it probably--
he would have seemed different.

19:14.999 --> 19:16.999
- Why did you wait
to tell people

19:16.999 --> 19:18.999
that you two
were going through this?

19:18.999 --> 19:20.999
- Because I thought
it was something

19:20.999 --> 19:22.999
that would pass quickly

19:22.999 --> 19:26.999
and no one would ever
need to know.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.999
- Katie, what did you know about
Scheana and Shay's problems?

19:28.999 --> 19:31.999
- We never would have noticed
that he was high on anything.

19:31.999 --> 19:34.999
When I found out,
I was shocked.

19:34.999 --> 19:36.999
- Lisa, were you surprised
when you found out?

19:36.999 --> 19:38.999
- I was, and I was
very disappointed, you know,

19:38.999 --> 19:41.000
the way he kind of
handled a lot of it.

19:41.999 --> 19:43.999
And when I saw him
talking to Scheana

19:43.999 --> 19:45.999
and saying to her that

19:45.999 --> 19:48.999
"You never gave me
a chance to explain to you,"

19:48.999 --> 19:50.999
I felt that
he was passing the blame

19:50.999 --> 19:51.999
and putting it on Scheana,

19:51.999 --> 19:53.999
and I love Scheana very much.

19:53.999 --> 19:55.999
I love them both
together as a couple.

19:55.999 --> 19:57.999
- When Shay returned home,
it was interesting

19:58.000 --> 19:59.999
because you chose
to have other people

19:59.999 --> 20:01.999
around for that moment.

20:01.999 --> 20:02.999
- Mm-hmm.
- Why?

20:02.999 --> 20:05.999
- He felt that
I would be very intimidating

20:05.999 --> 20:07.999
and not let him
get a word in

20:07.999 --> 20:09.999
and we kind of agreed together

20:09.999 --> 20:11.999
that if we had people
there as a buffer,

20:11.999 --> 20:13.999
if I did get like that,
you know,

20:13.999 --> 20:15.999
Ariana or Katie,
someone's gonna be like,

20:15.999 --> 20:18.999
"Scheana, shut the f*** up.
Let him talk."

20:18.999 --> 20:19.999
- Shay, you had said that you

20:19.999 --> 20:21.999
were actually scared
to talk to her.

20:21.999 --> 20:24.999
- It was just hard to
look her in the eye, honestly.

20:24.999 --> 20:27.999
I was so embarrassed.
I was so scared.

20:27.999 --> 20:30.000
- You wanted Tom and Tom there.
- I did, yeah.

20:30.999 --> 20:31.999
- Why?

20:31.999 --> 20:32.999
- For me,
if I'm comfortable,

20:32.999 --> 20:35.999
that's when the real Shay
that everyone knows comes out.

20:35.999 --> 20:38.999
- I really wanted to be
there because I wanted Shay

20:38.999 --> 20:40.999
to feel like this was
not gonna be an attack

20:40.999 --> 20:41.999
and this is a safe place,

20:41.999 --> 20:42.999
and you have friends here.

20:42.999 --> 20:44.999
- That's the first thing
we said.

20:44.999 --> 20:46.999
It's not an intervention;
it's a conversation.

20:46.999 --> 20:47.999
We're here for you...
- Emotional support.

20:47.999 --> 20:49.999
- Yeah.
- Encouragement.

20:49.999 --> 20:50.999
- He had already stopped
taking the pills

20:50.999 --> 20:52.999
six months prior.

20:52.999 --> 20:54.999
The issue at the time
was I was worried

20:54.999 --> 20:56.999
he was going to start
taking them again.

20:56.999 --> 20:59.999
And I kind of felt like we
needed that support system,

20:59.999 --> 21:01.999
our closest friends there

21:01.999 --> 21:03.999
to be like,
we're all in this together.

21:03.999 --> 21:05.999
Like, we're here for you.

21:05.999 --> 21:07.999
- Jax, you said numerous times
that you were not surprised

21:07.999 --> 21:09.999
to see Scheana and Shay
having troubles.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.999
- Yeah.
- Why?

21:11.999 --> 21:12.999
- See, I didn't--I thought it
was just strictly--

21:13.000 --> 21:14.999
I was not--I didn't know about
the pills and all this.

21:14.999 --> 21:15.999
- Jax doesn't listen.

21:15.999 --> 21:17.999
He did know about it.
We had a whole conversation.

21:17.999 --> 21:18.999
- I didn't know
about the pills and all that.

21:18.999 --> 21:19.999
I just thought
it was drinking.

21:19.999 --> 21:21.999
- But you did, Jax,
you just don't listen

21:21.999 --> 21:22.999
or remember
the sh** I tell you.

21:22.999 --> 21:24.999
- Well, you didn't tell me--
I didn't know the pills.

21:24.999 --> 21:25.999
- I told you what was going on.
- And he forgot?

21:25.999 --> 21:27.999
- I didn't know the pills.
I didn't know that.

21:27.999 --> 21:28.999
Whatever it was,
whatever be the case--

21:28.999 --> 21:31.999
- You're like a colander.
- A what?

21:31.999 --> 21:33.999
- It just goes right through.
- He doesn't know what that is.

21:33.999 --> 21:34.999
- He doesn't know
what a colander is.

21:34.999 --> 21:36.999
- You know,
you put noodles in to drain.

21:36.999 --> 21:37.999
- Like a strainer, like a--
- Oh, oh!

21:37.999 --> 21:39.999
Why can't you just say
"strainer"?

21:39.999 --> 21:40.999
- It's called a colander.

21:40.999 --> 21:42.000
- But I didn't know
all the details.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.999
I didn't know
what was going on.

21:43.999 --> 21:44.999
That's just what I thought.

21:44.999 --> 21:45.999
Scheana's very on
all the time.

21:45.999 --> 21:47.000
She doesn't ever punch out.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
You know, and Shay's
just the opposite,

21:49.000 --> 21:50.999
laid-back, chill,

21:50.999 --> 21:51.999
and I think she was always
on the go all the time,

21:51.999 --> 21:52.999
and sometimes
he's, you know, at home,

21:52.999 --> 21:54.999
and it's just kind of,
what else do you do?

21:54.999 --> 21:56.999
- Well, you know,
he had a very strong opinion,

21:56.999 --> 21:57.999
in that room to me,

21:58.000 --> 22:00.999
a very negative opinion
about their relationship.

22:00.999 --> 22:02.999
And they were
going through a lot

22:02.999 --> 22:03.999
and you really
weren't supportive.

22:03.999 --> 22:05.999
- She needs to let him
have some say in things.

22:05.999 --> 22:07.999
He has no balls.

22:07.999 --> 22:08.999
- Well, would you have balls

22:08.999 --> 22:10.999
if you were chomping
on f***ing pills all day?

22:10.999 --> 22:11.999
- Absolutely.
- No, you wouldn't, right?

22:11.999 --> 22:12.999
- Well, why do you
think he's doing that?

22:12.999 --> 22:13.999
Because he's miserable.

22:13.999 --> 22:14.999
- Listen,
you're not a therapist.

22:14.999 --> 22:16.999
Why are you being so negative
about Scheana and Shay?

22:16.999 --> 22:17.999
You should be supportive.

22:17.999 --> 22:19.999
- I have milk that
has a longer shelf life

22:19.999 --> 22:20.999
than that marriage.

22:20.999 --> 22:21.999
- It was really hard
to see someone

22:21.999 --> 22:23.999
who I consider one
of my closest friends

22:23.999 --> 22:26.999
say such negative things
about our relationship

22:26.999 --> 22:28.999
at the time you said it.

22:28.999 --> 22:30.999
- Yeah.
- It was really hurtful.

22:30.999 --> 22:31.999
- Yeah.

22:31.999 --> 22:33.999
- Do you want to apologize?

22:33.999 --> 22:34.999
- I apologize, Sch--
- He has.

22:34.999 --> 22:36.999
- You guys know I'm sorry.

22:36.999 --> 22:38.999
We've had--he, me, Scheana,
and I had this talk already.

22:38.999 --> 22:41.000
- Scheana,
I want to get into your approach

22:41.999 --> 22:43.999
to Shay's recovery,

22:43.999 --> 22:45.999
because you really got
hammered on social media.

22:45.999 --> 22:46.999
- Yeah.

22:46.999 --> 22:50.999
- You said that you didn't want
Shay to be a sober bore--

22:50.999 --> 22:52.999
- I said, "Don't get sh**faced;
don't be a bore."

22:52.999 --> 22:54.999
I didn't say he's a bore.

22:54.999 --> 22:56.999
- But if someone
has a problem

22:56.999 --> 22:59.999
with substance abuse
or addiction,

22:59.999 --> 23:02.999
what you're saying is

23:02.999 --> 23:06.999
"I want you to be able
to partake responsibly

23:06.999 --> 23:08.999
because it makes me
feel better,"

23:08.999 --> 23:11.999
but maybe that wouldn't
be right for him.

23:11.999 --> 23:13.999
- It was so unfortunate that
it took such a negative turn

23:13.999 --> 23:16.999
because of my ignorance
on addiction,

23:16.999 --> 23:18.999
but I didn't know anything
about addiction.

23:18.999 --> 23:20.999
Why would I?

23:20.999 --> 23:21.999
It wasn't something that
I had dealt with before.

23:21.999 --> 23:24.999
- It's just unfortunate
the way she gets treated

23:24.999 --> 23:26.999
because I put her
in that situation,

23:26.999 --> 23:29.999
and I'm right now

23:29.999 --> 23:32.999
taking 100% responsibility
for everything.

23:32.999 --> 23:34.999
- Well, let me ask you this,

23:34.999 --> 23:36.999
I mean, when you were giving
Shay those tampons

23:36.999 --> 23:39.999
full of tequila...

23:39.999 --> 23:40.999
- I'm not on my period anymore,

23:40.999 --> 23:42.999
but I brought
these just in case.

23:42.999 --> 23:43.999
Oh, sh**.

23:43.999 --> 23:44.999
Pick it up.
It's tequila.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.999
Toss it back.

23:46.999 --> 23:48.999
- And you were ordering
every cocktail on the menu

23:48.999 --> 23:50.999
at your anniversary...

23:50.999 --> 23:52.999
- I think I'm just gonna try one
of each of the prime cocktails.

23:52.999 --> 23:54.999
Berries and Bubbles,
maybe, first?

23:54.999 --> 23:55.999
Then I want
a cucumber gimlet,

23:55.999 --> 23:57.999
then I want a Prime margarita.

23:57.999 --> 23:58.999
- That's the one I want to get.
Yeah, that sounds good.

23:58.999 --> 24:00.999
- Then I want
a Black Orchid.

24:00.999 --> 24:02.999
I was doing
the best I could.

24:02.999 --> 24:03.999
I didn't know how
to deal with that,

24:03.999 --> 24:06.999
and for me, if he says,
"I'm not stopping drinking.

24:06.999 --> 24:07.999
I'm not an alcoholic."

24:07.999 --> 24:10.999
My advice was "Why don't you
just try and cut back?"

24:10.999 --> 24:12.999
So it was just us trying
to figure out

24:12.999 --> 24:15.999
how he can keep drinking,
if that's what he chose,

24:15.999 --> 24:18.999
and how we could do it
in a way

24:18.999 --> 24:20.999
where we're not fighting
because he's getting drunk.

24:20.999 --> 24:22.999
And it was
really f***ing difficult.

24:22.999 --> 24:25.999
- But there's also been nights
where I've literally

24:25.999 --> 24:27.999
served you two margaritas,
you two rum and Cokes,

24:27.999 --> 24:30.999
and you both a shot,

24:30.999 --> 24:33.999
and because Shay's disagreed
with you or something

24:33.999 --> 24:34.999
you've literally been like

24:34.999 --> 24:35.999
"Well, you're drunk anyways,

24:35.999 --> 24:37.999
so I can't talk to you
about this right now."

24:38.000 --> 24:40.999
- No, there's a look that
he used to get in his eyes

24:40.999 --> 24:42.000
and you could tell--
other people could tell.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.999
It wasn't
just me being crazy.

24:44.999 --> 24:47.999
- He's saying sometimes
you use it to talk down to him.

24:47.999 --> 24:48.999
- I've seen that.
- I don't do that.

24:48.999 --> 24:51.000
- And James is nodding.

24:51.999 --> 24:53.000
- My God,
I'm gonna defend her here,

24:53.000 --> 24:55.999
because I think with what
they've been through,

24:55.999 --> 24:57.999
I don't see her
talk down to him.

24:57.999 --> 25:00.999
I see her build him up.

25:00.999 --> 25:02.999
- For everything that we
went through this past year,

25:02.999 --> 25:05.999
as terrible as it was,

25:05.999 --> 25:07.999
I'm so glad
it all happened,

25:07.999 --> 25:10.999
and I'm glad that I'm able
to watch the show back,

25:10.999 --> 25:12.999
and, like, even though
I look like an ass****,

25:12.999 --> 25:14.999
and I look uneducated,
and I look ignorant,

25:14.999 --> 25:15.999
and I look stupid,

25:15.999 --> 25:18.999
I'm like,
I see all of that,

25:18.999 --> 25:19.999
and I've taken that all,

25:19.999 --> 25:22.999
and I've bettered
myself so much.

25:22.999 --> 25:24.999
Like, I feel
like I'm more educated

25:24.999 --> 25:26.999
on addiction and alcoholism,

25:26.999 --> 25:29.999
and I just want to say
I'm so f***ing proud of him.

25:29.999 --> 25:32.999
He hasn't drank
in over three months.

25:32.999 --> 25:33.999
- Yeah.
- Good job, Shay.

25:33.999 --> 25:35.999
- Yeah.
- Great. That's headline news.

25:35.999 --> 25:37.999
- So did you quit pills
cold turkey then?

25:37.999 --> 25:39.999
- Yeah, yeah.
- No meetings, no nothing?

25:39.999 --> 25:41.999
- That I don't understand.

25:41.999 --> 25:43.999
save my marriage or f***ing--

25:43.999 --> 25:46.999
choose Scheana
or choose drugs.

25:46.999 --> 25:48.999
- And it was
that easy to stop?

25:48.999 --> 25:49.999
- No, no, no.
It was not.

25:49.999 --> 25:51.999
- Can I say one thing?

25:51.999 --> 25:52.999
I have obviously
put my two cents in

25:52.999 --> 25:55.999
about his addiction

25:55.999 --> 25:56.999
and the way she has handled it,

25:56.999 --> 25:57.999
so I do apologize to you

25:57.999 --> 26:00.000
for certain things
that I have said.

26:00.999 --> 26:02.999
From an outsider looking in,

26:02.999 --> 26:04.999
we don't know what
Shay's saying to her.

26:04.999 --> 26:06.999
We don't know, you know,
the backstory.

26:06.999 --> 26:10.999
- You know,
don't take this the wrong way,

26:10.999 --> 26:12.999
but you've had some
very strong opinions

26:12.999 --> 26:15.000
about their marriage.

26:15.999 --> 26:17.999
- He's disloyal because
he hasn't been honest.

26:17.999 --> 26:18.999
He's guilty by omission.

26:18.999 --> 26:20.999
You're right
to take this seriously.

26:20.999 --> 26:21.999
You're right to be upset.

26:21.999 --> 26:25.999
It kind of opens the door
to a lot of other questions.

26:25.999 --> 26:28.999
- I just wonder what
your reaction to that is.

26:28.999 --> 26:30.999
- It was unfortunate
because Lisa was kind of

26:30.999 --> 26:32.999
an example
of the reason why

26:32.999 --> 26:36.999
I didn't want to talk
about it or come out

26:36.999 --> 26:40.999
because I felt like
you kind of look down

26:40.999 --> 26:41.000
on me a little bit

26:41.000 --> 26:43.999
and kind of
judged me in a way.

26:43.999 --> 26:45.999
And I know
it was out of, like,

26:45.999 --> 26:46.999
if you want to call it
"tough love,"

26:46.999 --> 26:49.999
but it was just--
it didn't make things easier.

26:49.999 --> 26:52.999
- I was furious with him
for lying to her.

26:52.999 --> 26:55.999
And I was also worried
that they were both

26:55.999 --> 26:57.999
sweeping too much
under the carpet.

26:57.999 --> 26:59.999
Sweeping everything
under the carpet

26:59.999 --> 27:00.999
makes for a very bumpy floor.

27:00.999 --> 27:03.999
- But, Lisa, you're his,
like, worst fear in a way,

27:03.999 --> 27:04.999
of, like, how people
would react.

27:04.999 --> 27:05.999
- And I'm sorry about that,

27:05.999 --> 27:08.999
because I wanted
nothing more

27:08.999 --> 27:10.999
than your marriage
to work.

27:10.999 --> 27:12.999
Because I love them
as a couple,

27:12.999 --> 27:15.999
and I love how much they love
each other, you know?

27:15.999 --> 27:18.999
- It was a crazy,
crazy, crazy time

27:18.999 --> 27:20.999
that I'm glad's over.

27:20.999 --> 27:22.999
You're dealing with
your first year of marriage.

27:22.999 --> 27:24.999
We're dealing with
an addiction problem.

27:24.999 --> 27:28.999
All of this stuff
on television.

27:28.999 --> 27:29.999
- Right.
- You know?

27:29.999 --> 27:30.999
And we could
go back and say,

27:30.999 --> 27:32.999
"I wish
I would have done this.

27:32.999 --> 27:33.999
I should have
called this person."

27:33.999 --> 27:36.999
But you know what?
It doesn't work that way.

27:36.999 --> 27:40.999
People, like, give her sh**
for making me do this.

27:40.999 --> 27:42.000
If it wasn't for her,

27:42.999 --> 27:43.999
I'd probably still be
taking these things.

27:43.999 --> 27:45.999
- I think she is
your greatest asset.

27:45.999 --> 27:47.999
I really do.
- She is.

27:47.999 --> 27:50.999
- Well, I want to
thank you for being here

27:50.999 --> 27:51.999
and for being so honest
about this--

27:51.999 --> 27:53.999
- We love you.
- Because I know it's so hard.

27:53.999 --> 27:54.999
- And you got your zest back.

27:54.999 --> 27:55.999
I can see it.
- Yeah, you do.

27:55.999 --> 27:56.999
You have your zing.
- Your light.

27:56.999 --> 27:58.999
- And you look great
and good luck with everything.

27:58.999 --> 27:59.999
We're gonna take a break.

27:59.999 --> 28:02.999
More from Sur
when we come back.

28:02.999 --> 28:03.999
Coming up...

28:03.999 --> 28:04.999
let's see how regret looks.

28:04.999 --> 28:06.999
- It still looks bad.

28:06.999 --> 28:08.999
- It's just not as bold,
you know?

28:08.999 --> 28:10.999
- I feel like it looks like a
Flamin' Hot Cheeto.

28:19.999 --> 28:21.000
for the "Vanderpump Rules"
reunion.

28:21.999 --> 28:22.999
I want to talk about Ariana's

28:22.999 --> 28:25.999
epic 30th birthday party.

28:30.999 --> 28:31.999
- f***.

28:31.999 --> 28:32.999
- Oh, your balls really--oh.

28:32.999 --> 28:34.999
- Why the kids theme?

28:34.999 --> 28:35.999
- 'Cause it's so much fun.

28:35.999 --> 28:38.999
And I hate
going to a club,

28:38.999 --> 28:40.999
going to a nice dinner.

28:40.999 --> 28:42.999
It's like,
we do that all the time.

28:42.999 --> 28:44.999
Why not do something
really different and weird?

28:44.999 --> 28:46.999
And Scheana had
actually suggested

28:46.999 --> 28:47.999
"Why don't you do, like,

28:47.999 --> 28:49.999
a bunch of, like,
really cool kids things."

28:49.999 --> 28:52.999
And I was like, "I think that
sounds like a really good time."

28:52.999 --> 28:54.999
- Lala, were you upset
that you weren't invited?

28:54.999 --> 28:56.999
- My feelings were hurt.
Yeah, definitely.

28:56.999 --> 28:57.999
- Should have pulled
a Kristen.

28:59.999 --> 29:02.999
- We should have
just gone together.

29:02.999 --> 29:05.999
- Sandoval,
it was a fairly awkward moment

29:05.999 --> 29:08.999
when Ariana confided to you

29:08.999 --> 29:12.999
that birthdays make her
remember her late dad

29:12.999 --> 29:17.999
and you then opted
to head to Vegas.

29:17.999 --> 29:18.999
- I had that thing stuck
in my head

29:18.999 --> 29:21.999
that my dad used to say to me
every year on my birthday.

29:21.999 --> 29:22.999
"I consider myself
the luckiest man

29:22.999 --> 29:25.999
on the face of the Earth."

29:25.999 --> 29:29.999
- I'm always
gonna be here for you.

29:29.999 --> 29:30.999
But apparently
he told me that we're going

29:30.999 --> 29:33.999
to a construction yard,
and we're taking bulldozers

29:33.999 --> 29:38.999
and, like, crushing sh**
with bulldozers.

29:38.999 --> 29:42.999
- It was really tough
to do and to watch.

29:42.999 --> 29:44.999
I just really felt
like it was important for me

29:44.999 --> 29:45.999
to be honest at that point

29:45.999 --> 29:49.999
just so that he knew
that I wasn't acting weird

29:49.999 --> 29:51.999
for the last couple of days
just for the sake of it,

29:51.999 --> 29:54.999
or that I was just kind of,
you know,

29:54.999 --> 29:56.999
being a bitch for the
sake of being a bitch.

29:56.999 --> 29:57.999
I felt like
I was holding back

29:57.999 --> 30:00.999
and that I just needed
to tell you

30:00.999 --> 30:01.999
how I was really feeling.

30:01.999 --> 30:05.999
- Ariana growing up
had issues with people

30:05.999 --> 30:07.999
sort of excluding her,

30:07.999 --> 30:10.999
and she's never really
had a big birthday ever.

30:10.999 --> 30:13.999
And so when this whole
Vegas thing kind of happened

30:13.999 --> 30:16.999
she sort of felt like again
it was gonna kind of be

30:16.999 --> 30:18.999
overshadowed and, like,
no big deal.

30:18.999 --> 30:19.999
And I--and I get that.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.999
- Lisa, what did you think
about the guys

30:21.999 --> 30:23.999
leaving the girls
back in LA?

30:23.999 --> 30:25.999
- I think they're ridiculous.

30:25.999 --> 30:26.999
I think they're all
in relationships,

30:26.999 --> 30:28.999
and they should
take it seriously,

30:28.999 --> 30:29.999
and why do you go to Vegas?

30:29.999 --> 30:31.999
You go to Vegas
to get into trouble.

30:31.999 --> 30:33.000
That's what Vegas
was built for.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.999
- What would you do
if Ken did that?

30:34.999 --> 30:35.999
- It would be
a one-way trip.

30:35.999 --> 30:37.999
He'd go but he wouldn't
be coming back.

30:37.999 --> 30:40.999
- Schwartz, you got
a good ass sandwich in...

30:40.999 --> 30:41.999
- I mean...
- Oh, my God.

30:41.999 --> 30:43.999
- Vegas.

30:43.999 --> 30:44.999
- Oh, my God.
- No, I'm not part of this game.

30:44.999 --> 30:47.999
- Oh, my God.
Stop.

30:47.999 --> 30:48.999
- Jax, what the f***
are you doing?

30:48.999 --> 30:50.999
- That's wrong, dude.
- I'm sorry.

30:50.999 --> 30:52.999
- Don't do that.
- You're welcome, America.

30:52.999 --> 30:54.999
- You guys strip
in front of each other

30:54.999 --> 30:56.999
more than me
and my gay friends.

30:56.999 --> 30:57.999
- It's like hazing.
- It's like hazing.

30:57.999 --> 30:58.999
- It's like frat bros.

30:58.999 --> 30:59.999
- But he gets back at me,
though,

30:59.999 --> 31:01.999
because he'll send me
a random video

31:01.999 --> 31:03.999
where he's literally bare-ass
farting on my pillow.

31:03.999 --> 31:04.999
- Yes, you did.

31:04.999 --> 31:06.999
- How old are you?

31:06.999 --> 31:07.999
- Didn't he just do
that to you dog today?

31:07.999 --> 31:08.999
- Exactly.
- I report--that's animal abuse.

31:08.999 --> 31:09.999
- This was what
these guys did to me

31:09.999 --> 31:10.999
for four years
while I lived with them,

31:10.999 --> 31:13.999
so sometimes, you know,
I try to get a little payback.

31:13.999 --> 31:15.999
- Katie, how did girl's night

31:15.999 --> 31:18.999
turn into
girl-on-girl action?

31:18.999 --> 31:20.000
- Oh, that's hot!
- Send it to the boys.

31:20.999 --> 31:21.999
- Let me see you shake that!

31:21.999 --> 31:24.999
Oh!
Damn, Gina.

31:24.999 --> 31:25.999
- I think I said to you,

31:25.999 --> 31:27.999
"Don't get mad; get even,"
right?

31:27.999 --> 31:30.000
- Yeah, so I mean,
this was the PG-ish version

31:30.999 --> 31:31.999
of getting even, so...

31:31.999 --> 31:32.999
- Not her first dip
in the lady pond.

31:32.999 --> 31:35.999
- Oh...
- He says sh**, then he hides.

31:35.999 --> 31:36.999
- Katie, have you been
with a lady?

31:36.999 --> 31:39.999
- Perhaps.
- Ah.

31:39.999 --> 31:40.999
- Haven't we all?
- Um...

31:40.999 --> 31:42.999
- I mean...
- I think so.

31:42.999 --> 31:44.999
- Why, you have too?
- Yeah!

31:44.999 --> 31:45.999
- Kristen?
- Yeah.

31:45.999 --> 31:46.999
- Ariana?

31:46.999 --> 31:47.999
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, yeah.

31:47.999 --> 31:48.999
- Lala?
- I've only kissed a girl.

31:48.999 --> 31:50.999
- This is an interesting...

31:50.999 --> 31:53.999
The lower area has all swum
in the lady pond.

31:53.999 --> 31:54.999
- Have you been with a woman?
- No!

31:54.999 --> 31:56.999
- No!

31:57.999 --> 32:00.999
- Gold star.
- I'm clean.

32:00.999 --> 32:01.999
I'm a gold star.

32:01.999 --> 32:02.999
Does it go the other way
with the guys?

32:02.999 --> 32:04.999
Have you ever been
with a guy?

32:04.999 --> 32:05.999
- I've kissed Tom,
but we've never made it

32:05.999 --> 32:07.999
past first base.

32:07.999 --> 32:08.999
- Jax?
- I've kissed.

32:08.999 --> 32:09.999
- But never open-mouth.
- Oh, Jax.

32:09.999 --> 32:11.999
- I don't know if I believe you.
- Oh, my God.

32:11.999 --> 32:12.999
- Jax, I don't believe
Jax at all.

32:12.999 --> 32:13.999
- Make them kiss.

32:13.999 --> 32:15.999
- I think you are a
"hole is a hole" kind of guy.

32:15.999 --> 32:17.999
- No.

32:17.999 --> 32:19.999
- Sandoval?
- No.

32:19.999 --> 32:20.999
- No.

32:20.999 --> 32:21.999
- Sandoval, come on.
- James?

32:21.999 --> 32:23.999
- Absolutely not.
- Wow.

32:23.999 --> 32:24.999
Well, Lala, I have
to assume you were very happy

32:24.999 --> 32:26.999
to be invited
to that girls' night.

32:26.999 --> 32:28.999
- Yeah, I felt like
we were making a breakthrough.

32:28.999 --> 32:31.999
I'm, like, "Aw, I guess they
don't think I'm that bad."

32:31.999 --> 32:33.999
- That's how you guys should
resolve all of your conflicts:

32:33.999 --> 32:34.999
by making out.

32:34.999 --> 32:36.999
- That's how I feel!

32:36.999 --> 32:38.999
- So Sandoval and Schwartz
kept their pants on in Vegas,

32:38.999 --> 32:42.999
except for
getting ass tattoos.

32:42.999 --> 32:44.999
What the f***?

32:44.999 --> 32:45.999
- All right, I got one too.

32:45.999 --> 32:46.999
- Oh, my God.
He did get one.

32:46.999 --> 32:48.999
What?

32:48.999 --> 32:51.999
- Katie, do you like
the "Bubba" tattoo?

32:51.999 --> 32:52.999
- Yeah, I think it's cute.

32:52.999 --> 32:53.999
It's tasteful.

32:53.999 --> 32:55.999
- Well, Ariana
didn't hide her disgust

32:55.999 --> 32:58.999
at the bacon A
on Sandoval's ass.

32:58.999 --> 33:01.999
- Arianna, can I just
say I was honestly

33:01.999 --> 33:03.999
taken aback at
how much ownership you took

33:03.999 --> 33:05.999
over Tom's ass, like...
- I love his ass.

33:05.999 --> 33:06.999
- I know.
I didn't...

33:06.999 --> 33:08.999
- It was very sad.
- I didn't think of it either.

33:08.999 --> 33:10.999
- He was, in a ways,
trying to give it to you.

33:10.999 --> 33:11.999
- Yeah.

33:11.999 --> 33:15.000
- How far in the laser removal
process are you?

33:15.000 --> 33:17.999
- Well, I went to one session

33:17.999 --> 33:18.999
and I put it on hold
because...

33:18.999 --> 33:21.999
- It probably hurts like hell.
- So it's like half--

33:21.999 --> 33:24.000
- One, two, three.
Good, good, good, good, good.

33:24.999 --> 33:27.999
- Ow, ow, f***.
- Perfect.

33:27.999 --> 33:29.000
- That looked painful.

33:29.999 --> 33:30.999
- It's--it, yeah,
it does hurt.

33:30.999 --> 33:33.999
But that's not really
why I put it on hold.

33:33.999 --> 33:36.999
I just--it was meant
to be cool and endearing,

33:36.999 --> 33:38.999
literally I googled
"cool letter A."

33:39.999 --> 33:41.999
- He did. He did.
- The first result.

33:41.999 --> 33:43.999
- And it ended up
being so ungodly bad.

33:43.999 --> 33:45.999
- Let's see how regret looks.
- It still looks bad.

33:45.999 --> 33:46.999
- It looks like Cheeto.

33:46.999 --> 33:48.999
- It's just not as bold,
you know?

33:48.999 --> 33:50.999
- The thing is,
it's so bad it's good.

33:50.999 --> 33:52.999
- I feel like it looks
like a Flamin' Hot Cheeto.

33:52.999 --> 33:53.999
- Oh!
- Oh.

33:53.999 --> 33:55.999
- Oh, now that's not so bad.
- Oh, I like it.

33:55.999 --> 33:56.999
Yeah, no, it is better.
- That looks good.

33:56.999 --> 33:57.999
- Yeah, lookit...
- Are you turned on?

33:57.999 --> 33:58.999
- Whoa!

33:58.999 --> 33:59.999
- Coming up...

33:59.999 --> 34:01.999
- We've been in group
settings a million times--

34:01.999 --> 34:03.999
- Kristen, I've been in group
settings with you for years

34:03.999 --> 34:05.999
where I've always
been cordial.

34:05.999 --> 34:06.999
It doesn't mean
I like you.

34:15.999 --> 34:16.999
Kristen,
I was surprised

34:16.999 --> 34:18.999
when you marched into Sur
that night

34:18.999 --> 34:20.999
and apologized to Ariana.

34:20.999 --> 34:22.000
- I didn't march.
I casually strolled.

34:22.999 --> 34:24.999
I was in a positive mood.

34:24.999 --> 34:25.999
- I think you're a marcher.
- Yeah.

34:25.999 --> 34:27.999
- I do walk hard.
- You're a stomper.

34:27.999 --> 34:31.999
- Yeah, not a light walker.
- She stomps in.

34:31.999 --> 34:33.999
- I just want to apologize
for the way that I acted.

34:33.999 --> 34:34.999
I didn't need to have
these full-on f***ing

34:34.999 --> 34:36.999
immature meltdowns.

34:36.999 --> 34:39.999
Anything that I said,
it just was very, very immature.

34:39.999 --> 34:40.999
- I don't trust your motives,

34:40.999 --> 34:42.999
I don't trust
who you are as a person.

34:42.999 --> 34:43.999
You can do
whatever you want.

34:43.999 --> 34:47.999
Just do it away from me.

34:47.999 --> 34:50.999
- There were things that I knew
that I needed to own up to.

34:50.999 --> 34:51.999
Like, I said it to you,

34:51.999 --> 34:53.999
I said I was allowed
to be mad and upset,

34:53.999 --> 34:55.999
but it doesn't mean
I have to freak the f*** out

34:55.999 --> 34:56.999
and act like a psycho.

34:56.999 --> 34:59.999
- James, what did you
think of Kristen's apology?

34:59.999 --> 35:01.999
- Oh, it was complete bullsh**.

35:01.999 --> 35:02.999
I mean, you know,
absolute nonsense.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.999
- Ariana's nodding.
- I agree.

35:04.999 --> 35:05.999
- How do you think
it's complete bullsh**

35:05.999 --> 35:07.999
when we've actually had, like,
conversations since then?

35:07.999 --> 35:08.999
- Because I feel like out
of your desperate attempt

35:08.999 --> 35:10.999
to regain all of
your friendships,

35:10.999 --> 35:11.999
and you just did it
'cause your friends told you to.

35:11.999 --> 35:12.999
- If you didn't
think I was sorry,

35:12.999 --> 35:14.999
why would you
converse with me?

35:14.999 --> 35:15.999
- 'Cause I still think
that that apology was bullsh**.

35:15.999 --> 35:17.999
I mean,
if I thought it was genuine,

35:17.999 --> 35:19.999
things would
have been different.

35:19.999 --> 35:20.999
- If you go apologize to Ariana,
you can probably go on the trip.

35:20.999 --> 35:22.999
- How can you guys say that now

35:22.999 --> 35:23.999
knowing what the last
six months have been like?

35:23.999 --> 35:24.999
Where we've been in group
settings a million times.

35:24.999 --> 35:26.999
I've said a million times--

35:26.999 --> 35:28.999
- Kristen, I've been in group
settings with you for years

35:28.999 --> 35:29.999
where I've always
been cordial

35:29.999 --> 35:30.999
that doesn't mean
I like you.

35:30.999 --> 35:31.999
No.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
No, that's not true.

35:33.999 --> 35:34.999
You've never been cordial.

35:34.999 --> 35:35.999
- Yes, she has!
- Oh, I haven't?

35:35.999 --> 35:37.999
- We just ignore each other.
We just stay far away.

35:37.999 --> 35:40.000
- That's f***ing cordial.
- Yeah.

35:40.999 --> 35:41.999
Okay, well, you've
been a lot more

35:41.999 --> 35:43.999
than f***ing cordial
the last couple of times

35:43.999 --> 35:44.999
we've been in group settings.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.999
- That's a favor to my friends.

35:46.999 --> 35:47.999
- I mean,
she's telling you straight up.

35:47.999 --> 35:49.999
- I mean,
what do you want from me.

35:49.999 --> 35:51.999
- You told me that you wanted
her to apologize to you, though,

35:51.999 --> 35:53.000
so it was like,
Ariana feels you owe her

35:53.000 --> 35:54.999
and her whole family
an apology.

35:54.999 --> 35:55.999
- I said she should do
a lot of things.

35:55.999 --> 35:56.999
And so then you said,

35:56.999 --> 35:58.999
"Well, then, you need
to apologize to her."

35:58.999 --> 36:00.999
So then she goes,
"Okay, cool."

36:00.999 --> 36:01.999
- And then I sat on it.
I thought about it.

36:01.999 --> 36:02.999
- "Next step in
my apology tour

36:02.999 --> 36:04.999
"is that I have
to go apologize to Ariana.

36:04.999 --> 36:06.999
Why? So I can go to Hawaii."

36:06.999 --> 36:08.999
- Mm.
- Oh, so it was to go to Hawaii.

36:08.999 --> 36:09.999
- Yes.
- No, no.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.999
- No, she 100%
knew about Hawaii.

36:12.999 --> 36:14.999
- I was gonna do it--
of course I wanted to go, but--

36:14.999 --> 36:15.999
- Is that around the same time?
Is that around the same time?

36:15.999 --> 36:17.999
That makes perfect sense.
- Dude, you 100%--

36:17.999 --> 36:18.999
- She knew we were going
on a trip, 100%.

36:18.999 --> 36:19.999
- She knew we were
going on a trip, 100%.

36:19.999 --> 36:21.999
- I needed to own
the sh** that I did.

36:21.999 --> 36:22.999
- But you still
didn't really own it.

36:22.999 --> 36:23.999
- You didn't own it.
You said, "I was mad..."

36:23.999 --> 36:24.999
- You were like,
"I was mad, so like eh."

36:24.999 --> 36:26.999
- "Well, I was mad."
- "Well, I did--whatever I did.

36:26.999 --> 36:27.999
Eh. Whatever I did.
Whatever I did."

36:27.999 --> 36:29.999
- No, I said, "I'm not
apologizing for being mad

36:29.999 --> 36:30.999
"that you hooked up
with my boyfriend.

36:30.999 --> 36:31.999
"I'm not apologizing
for being upset.

36:31.999 --> 36:33.999
I'm apologizing for
the way that I handled it."

36:33.999 --> 36:34.999
- So, wait, we're still gonna
use the words "hooked up"

36:34.999 --> 36:35.999
when you know
that we kissed one time?

36:35.999 --> 36:37.000
We're still gonna do this?

36:37.999 --> 36:38.999
- Whatever, you guys
kissed one time in Vegas.

36:38.999 --> 36:41.999
- We're still, years later,
gonna perpetuate lies about me?

36:41.999 --> 36:43.999
- I watched--this summer I did
watch you guys lie to her face

36:43.999 --> 36:44.999
and say "nothing happened,"

36:45.000 --> 36:46.999
and made her feel like a crazy
person for ever thinking that--

36:46.999 --> 36:48.999
- She was a crazy person!
- She was a crazy person!

36:48.999 --> 36:49.999
- That had nothing
to do with us.

36:49.999 --> 36:51.999
- No, listen, I know,
but made her feel crazy

36:51.999 --> 36:52.999
that "how could
she possibly think

36:52.999 --> 36:54.999
that anything had ever
happened between you guys?"

36:54.999 --> 36:56.999
- We did not act
inappropriately.

36:56.999 --> 36:58.999
- Yeah.
- Ever.

36:58.999 --> 37:00.999
- Kristen then f***ed Jax twice
and made my life a living hell.

37:00.999 --> 37:02.999
- No one is saying that
I didn't f*** up, the point--

37:02.999 --> 37:03.999
- No, but you made
my life a living hell.

37:03.999 --> 37:04.999
- And every time
it's brought up,

37:04.999 --> 37:06.999
your initial response is

37:06.999 --> 37:07.999
"Well, you f***ed Jax."
It's like, no sh** I did.

37:07.999 --> 37:08.999
I f***ing admitted it.
Let's move on.

37:08.999 --> 37:10.999
- No, no, no,
but that's the thing.

37:10.999 --> 37:12.000
Like, I don't want to hear
about the hell you went through

37:12.999 --> 37:13.999
because I kissed Ariana.

37:13.999 --> 37:14.999
- Kristen, how did
that make you lose your mind

37:14.999 --> 37:16.999
when you had slept with
multiple people

37:16.999 --> 37:18.999
behind his back?
- Multiple.

37:18.999 --> 37:19.999
- Yeah, it doesn't mean
it doesn't hurt though.

37:19.999 --> 37:20.999
- Multiple.
- Multiple of my best friends.

37:20.999 --> 37:22.999
- Why did that make you
so crazy that they had kissed

37:22.999 --> 37:23.999
when you had done
so much more?

37:23.999 --> 37:26.999
- It--but it was, like,
three years of thinking this

37:26.999 --> 37:27.999
and being, like, lied to,

37:27.999 --> 37:29.999
and he had a special friendship
with Ariana.

37:29.999 --> 37:31.999
- She felt threatened
by their friendship.

37:31.999 --> 37:33.999
- You thought
that was an emotional affair.

37:33.999 --> 37:34.999
- Yeah, absolutely.

37:34.999 --> 37:35.999
I was insecure.
- That...ugh.

37:35.999 --> 37:37.999
- I felt like I was
gonna lose him to you.

37:37.999 --> 37:39.999
- I can't get into
the nitty-gritty of, like...

37:39.999 --> 37:41.999
- Yeah, let's not--
let's not get into this.

37:41.999 --> 37:42.999
- You guys are acting
like I'm insulting you

37:42.999 --> 37:43.999
right now, for f***'s sake.

37:43.999 --> 37:45.999
- Lisa, did you
buy Kristen's apology?

37:45.999 --> 37:47.999
- No, not at all,

37:47.999 --> 37:48.999
because I thought,
like they're saying,

37:48.999 --> 37:50.999
it was self-serving,

37:50.999 --> 37:52.999
because I thought she wanted
to be back in the group.

37:52.999 --> 37:54.999
She never said, "Ariana, I'm
really sorry for hurting you."

37:54.999 --> 37:55.999
I think that's what Ariana
needed--needed to hear.

37:55.999 --> 37:57.999
- I did, actually.

37:57.999 --> 38:00.999
Anyway, if you don't believe me,
you don't believe me.

38:00.999 --> 38:01.999
That's totally your choice.

38:01.999 --> 38:02.999
I went in strictly because,

38:02.999 --> 38:03.999
yeah, was I kind of
on an apology tour?

38:03.999 --> 38:08.999
But it wasn't
a bullsh** apology tour.

38:08.999 --> 38:09.999
- At Jax's birthday lunch,

38:09.999 --> 38:10.999
she did this thing
where she was like,

38:10.999 --> 38:12.999
"You know,
I apologized to Ariana,

38:12.999 --> 38:13.999
I mean, I could apologize
to you if you want, too."

38:13.999 --> 38:15.999
- I didn't say it like that.
I did apologize to you.

38:15.999 --> 38:17.999
- You did exactly
say it like that.

38:17.999 --> 38:19.999
- I did apologize to you.

38:19.999 --> 38:21.000
I haven't apologized
to you yet,

38:21.999 --> 38:23.999
which I have
no problem doing.

38:23.999 --> 38:25.999
At this point it's like
I have nothing left to lose.

38:25.999 --> 38:27.999
- You got advice
from your therapist

38:27.999 --> 38:30.999
and you've been regurgitating it
this entire year.

38:30.999 --> 38:32.999
- Well, that's kind of what
f***ing therapy is, Sandoval.

38:32.999 --> 38:33.999
- Over-laughing at jokes.
No, that's not!

38:33.999 --> 38:35.999
- If your motives are pure,
then it is.

38:35.999 --> 38:37.999
- Exactly.
Over-laughing at jokes.

38:37.999 --> 38:39.000
Overenthusiasm.

38:39.999 --> 38:41.999
- I'm a happy person.
- I know you well enough to know

38:41.999 --> 38:42.999
when you're overdoing
it big time.

38:42.999 --> 38:43.999
- And she does that wide-face
thing, that...

38:43.999 --> 38:46.999
- Maybe you don't
know me anymore,

38:46.999 --> 38:47.999
'cause I don't know you anymore.

38:47.999 --> 38:49.000
- Well, you know me
well enough

38:49.999 --> 38:50.999
to know
I'm not over-laughing,

38:50.999 --> 38:52.999
I'm not over-trying
to do anything.

38:52.999 --> 38:54.999
I'm just talking.
- You over-try to do everything.

38:54.999 --> 38:55.999
- No, he doesn't.

38:55.999 --> 38:57.000
- You want to be the center
of attention all the time.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.999
- No.
- What?

38:58.999 --> 38:59.999
- I don't know
where you get that.

38:59.999 --> 39:00.999
- It's 'cause he's
the number one guy.

39:00.999 --> 39:01.999
- Oh, my gosh.
- Right, Jax?

39:01.999 --> 39:04.999
- That's me.
- That's me.

39:04.999 --> 39:06.999
- Tom, is there
anything that Kristen can do

39:06.999 --> 39:11.999
that would make you
be at peace with her?

39:11.999 --> 39:14.999
- Dude, look,
I am at peace with her.

39:14.999 --> 39:15.999
- You don't seem like it.

39:15.999 --> 39:16.999
- No, but when--
- No, clearly not.

39:16.999 --> 39:18.999
- Katie,
just stop for a second.

39:18.999 --> 39:20.999
You know, there's people
that we were friends with

39:20.999 --> 39:22.999
where the only reason why
Kristen would hang out with them

39:22.999 --> 39:25.999
is because they were my friends
from, like, a decade.

39:25.999 --> 39:26.999
- They're my friends too!
- f***ed over my friend Missy.

39:26.999 --> 39:28.999
- No, they were my friends!

39:28.999 --> 39:31.999
- How did you meet Katie?
How did you meet this group?

39:31.999 --> 39:33.999
You knew Jax, but that's it.
- Scheana, yes, I did.

39:33.999 --> 39:34.999
- Oh, my gosh, are we really
gonna do this?

39:34.999 --> 39:35.999
- Through Villa Blanca,

39:35.999 --> 39:36.999
which is a place
I got you a job at.

39:36.999 --> 39:37.999
- But Schwartz and Katie.
- All right. All right.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.999
All right. All right.
- It's a little bit different.

39:39.999 --> 39:40.999
- So there's nothing
she can do.

39:40.999 --> 39:42.999
- We were together
for six f***ing years.

39:42.999 --> 39:43.999
No sh** I'm still gonna
be friends with them.

39:43.999 --> 39:44.999
- We were together for,
like, 5 1/2.

39:44.999 --> 39:46.999
The point is is that, look,
I'm fine.

39:46.999 --> 39:48.999
Like, I'm at peace.

39:49.999 --> 39:52.999
- But, dude, Andy,
I'm at peace, dude.

39:52.999 --> 39:53.999
- Okay.
- I am.

39:53.999 --> 39:55.999
- Okay.

39:55.999 --> 39:57.999
- But when I'm asked, like,
when people get into details,

39:57.999 --> 39:59.999
I have things to say and
a lot of damage has been done.

39:59.999 --> 40:00.999
- Yes. You get riled up.

40:04.999 --> 40:05.999
Coming up...

40:05.999 --> 40:06.999
- You were bad-mouthing me.
You were so malicious.

40:06.999 --> 40:08.999
- I don't want
to be friends with someone

40:08.999 --> 40:10.000
who's f***ing around
with my ex-boyfriend.

40:10.999 --> 40:11.999
- I'm speaking.

40:11.999 --> 40:12.999
- Let her finish.
That's so rude.

40:12.999 --> 40:13.999
- James, shut the f*** up.

40:21.999 --> 40:22.999
- Well, you acted
really buddy-buddy with me,

40:22.999 --> 40:25.999
and I actually thought
that you and I were good.

40:25.999 --> 40:26.999
But you started talking
behind my back.

40:26.999 --> 40:28.999
Really?

40:28.999 --> 40:29.999
- Because you started
hooking up with James.

40:29.999 --> 40:30.999
I said, "I don't want
to be friends with someone

40:30.999 --> 40:33.999
who is f***ing around
with my ex-boyfriend."

40:33.999 --> 40:35.999
- You were bad-mouthing me.
You were so malicious.

40:35.999 --> 40:36.999
And then you said,
"We're not good."

40:36.999 --> 40:38.999
- And you then you text me.
And then you text me--

40:38.999 --> 40:39.999
- I'm speaking!
- Let her finish, yeah.

40:39.999 --> 40:40.999
So rude.
- James, shut the f*** up.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.999
- We went to Lock & Key,
and you said,

40:42.999 --> 40:43.999
"Yeah, we're good"

40:43.999 --> 40:44.999
when Jax said,
"Are you two okay?"

40:44.999 --> 40:46.999
And I was like,
"No, we're not good."

40:46.999 --> 40:49.999
- Kristen,
what do you think about her?

40:49.999 --> 40:51.999
- I'm a ratchet whore.

40:51.999 --> 40:52.999
- Yeah, I definitely
felt that way this summer.

40:52.999 --> 40:55.999
- Whore bag.
- Whore bag.

40:55.999 --> 40:56.999
- For sure.
- Whore bag?

40:56.999 --> 40:58.999
- I don't like the things
I've seen on social media

40:58.999 --> 40:59.999
that she's said
about my friends.

40:59.999 --> 41:00.999
- But, Kristen,
I don't like the things

41:00.999 --> 41:02.999
that you've said either,

41:02.999 --> 41:04.999
and I gave you a chance,
and I feel like you gave me one,

41:04.999 --> 41:06.999
and it was almost
like it was fake.

41:06.999 --> 41:09.000
Like, "How does this benefit me
if I'm friends with Lala?"

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
- I'm, like, the least fake
person you will ever meet.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.999
- Dude, no.
- I disagree.

41:12.999 --> 41:13.999
I think that's me, honey.
- No, no, no, no.

41:13.999 --> 41:14.999
- What?

41:14.999 --> 41:16.999
- I don't even have
a f***ing filter.

41:16.999 --> 41:18.999
- Fall back, I'm bored now.
- Let's be real.

41:18.999 --> 41:19.999
- You can say,
"Oh, I'm owning this

41:19.999 --> 41:20.999
or I'm owning that."

41:20.999 --> 41:21.999
Or whatever the f***
you want to say...

41:21.999 --> 41:24.999
- And I have, and I did.
- But you have no idea--

41:24.999 --> 41:26.999
- But you don't know
the f***ing ripple effect.

41:26.999 --> 41:27.999
- Let's tame the language,
Ariana.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.999
- I'm sorry.
- That's not who you are.

41:29.999 --> 41:31.999
- You don't know
the ripple effect

41:31.999 --> 41:32.999
that things like that have.

41:32.999 --> 41:33.999
You don't know.

41:33.999 --> 41:35.999
- You've never had
to deal with it.

41:35.999 --> 41:36.999
- And I didn't ask for it,

41:36.999 --> 41:37.999
and it was no f***ing
fault of my own.

41:37.999 --> 41:38.999
It was all you.

41:38.999 --> 41:40.999
- If you just want
to point fingers--you, you, you.

41:40.999 --> 41:41.999
- This year
it's your apology tour,

41:41.999 --> 41:43.999
last year it was a "everybody's
just as bad as me" tour.

41:43.999 --> 41:44.999
- "And we didn't do--'cause
we're so f***ing innocent."

41:44.999 --> 41:46.999
- You tried to break
up Schwartz and Katie.

41:46.999 --> 41:47.999
- Don't you dare!

41:47.999 --> 41:49.000
- Don't--no, no, no,
don't	 you	 dare.

41:49.999 --> 41:50.999
You were talking
sh** about Scheana.

41:50.999 --> 41:53.000
- I didn't try
to break up Schwartz and Katie.

41:53.999 --> 41:54.999
- You were--tried to break up
Schwartz and Katie last year!

41:54.999 --> 41:55.999
- Well, everyone kind of did.

41:55.999 --> 41:56.999
- Our reunion last year
you did talk about--

41:56.999 --> 41:58.999
- It wasn't so aggressive,
though, like--

41:58.999 --> 41:59.999
- So that, like, every,
like-- so did he.

41:59.999 --> 42:00.999
So did she, like, whatever.

42:00.999 --> 42:01.999
Everyone isn't perfect.

42:01.999 --> 42:03.999
- I can't wait until she breaks
your heart again, Katie,

42:03.999 --> 42:04.999
'cause it's gonna happen.

42:04.999 --> 42:05.999
- I mean, this has
become--on her.

42:05.999 --> 42:07.999
- I can't wait till
she takes a sh** on all of you.

42:07.999 --> 42:08.999
She's gonna sh** on you all,
and mark my words right here.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.999
- I know.
We've been through it all.

42:10.999 --> 42:11.999
- Give it one year, babe.
- I've already heard it all.

42:11.999 --> 42:13.999
- I just can't wait to say,
"I told you so."

42:13.999 --> 42:14.999
- You are
the worst part of my life.

42:14.999 --> 42:16.999
These people have been in
my life for a really long time.

42:16.999 --> 42:17.999
- Shut your f***ing mouth,
Kristen.

42:17.999 --> 42:22.999
- Tom's a f***ing angel
in comparison to James.

42:22.999 --> 42:24.999
- Next week it's part two

42:24.999 --> 42:26.999
of the "Vanderpump Rules"
reunion.

42:26.999 --> 42:27.999
- Jax, you're jealous, mate.

42:27.999 --> 42:28.999
I've said it once;
I'll say it again.

42:28.999 --> 42:30.999
- What? I don't want to be a DJ!

42:30.999 --> 42:31.999
- When your veins start coming
out your neck,

42:31.999 --> 42:32.999
I get freaked out.

42:32.999 --> 42:33.999
- Yeah, you should be,

42:33.999 --> 42:34.999
because you're gonna
end up in trouble.

42:34.999 --> 42:35.999
- "Thank God.
Thank you.

42:35.999 --> 42:36.999
Thank you. Thank you!"

42:36.999 --> 42:37.999
- That's not what I said.

42:37.999 --> 42:38.999
I said, "Did he sign
a contract?"

42:38.999 --> 42:40.999
Literally.

42:40.999 --> 42:41.999
- Oh, my, why didn't
you write the contract

42:41.999 --> 42:42.999
and then give it
to me to give then?

42:42.999 --> 42:43.999
- Lisa, because you did this
behind my back!

42:43.999 --> 42:44.999
- Oh!

42:44.999 --> 42:46.999
- How is it $900 and not 1,000?

42:46.999 --> 42:48.999
- Listen, I'm not good
at making a sex tape.

42:48.999 --> 42:51.999
It was only worth 900.

42:51.999 --> 42:52.999
- If Jax and I wanted
to sleep together,

42:52.999 --> 42:54.999
we very well would have.

42:54.999 --> 42:55.999
- I had moved out here for him,

42:55.999 --> 42:57.999
so for him to come
back and be like

42:57.999 --> 42:59.999
"Well, I don't know
if I ever want to get married."

42:59.999 --> 43:00.999
- It's not you.

43:00.999 --> 43:03.999
It was just--
it's just the word "marriage."

43:03.999 --> 43:04.999
- Now that they're hanging out,

43:04.999 --> 43:06.999
she doesn't want
anything to do with me.

43:06.999 --> 43:09.999
- She needed to have the smack
brought down upon her.

43:09.999 --> 43:11.999
- All of you are ass****s.

43:11.999 --> 43:12.999
Ass****, ass****,
ass****, ass****.

43:12.999 --> 43:14.999
