WEBVTT

00:10.345 --> 00:12.805
The <i>luxury liner</i> S.S. Gotham Queen...

00:12.972 --> 00:15.600
<i>...is only hours out of Gotham City.</i>

00:15.808 --> 00:19.354
<i>Her passengers are enjoying
a final meal on-board...</i>

00:19.562 --> 00:23.608
<i>...little knowing
it could well be their final meal.</i>

00:23.816 --> 00:29.197
-It's been a lovely voyage, Captain Carlisle.
-And a great pleasure for me, Ms. Glaze.

00:29.405 --> 00:31.366
Seldom have I had a passenger list...

00:31.574 --> 00:35.787
...including a world famous ice skating star
such as yourself.

00:35.995 --> 00:39.374
And an international scientist from Iceland
such as Professor lsaacson...

00:39.582 --> 00:41.125
...to keep me company.

00:41.334 --> 00:44.712
Your field must be fascinating, professor.

00:44.921 --> 00:48.383
Just what is this formula you're taking
to Gotham City?

00:48.591 --> 00:52.053
To the world it's a secret formula, Ms. Glaze.

00:52.262 --> 00:56.015
But to you,
it's a formula for making instant ice.

00:56.224 --> 00:59.769
I'll be working in an advisory capacity
with the Bruce Wayne Foundation.

00:59.978 --> 01:01.771
What a coincidence.

01:01.980 --> 01:06.276
I'm opening tonight in an ice revue
at the Bruce Wayne Ice Arena.

01:06.484 --> 01:08.403
An iceberg?

01:08.611 --> 01:12.699
- Just outside the Gotham City Harbor?
-And dead ahead.

01:16.244 --> 01:21.165
Reverse engines.
I'll tell Captain Carlisle at once.

01:21.374 --> 01:25.545
<i>NARRATOR". But the location of this iceberg
isn't the only strange thing about it.</i>

01:26.713 --> 01:29.215
<i>It's what's inside the iceberg...</i>

01:29.424 --> 01:34.512
...in <i>Mr. Freeze's unique,
new hideout below the water line.</i>

01:36.806 --> 01:38.516
Our iceberg's been sighted.

01:38.683 --> 01:42.562
But too late for the Gotham Queen,
I'm afraid.

01:42.770 --> 01:47.817
Activate the ice magnets.
We'll pull her directly into our iceberg.

01:48.026 --> 01:52.447
And I'm sure we'll be hearing
from Ms. Glacia, shortly.

01:57.327 --> 01:58.911
Iceberg.

01:59.078 --> 02:00.538
Iceberg?

02:02.000 --> 02:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:09.964 --> 02:12.383
Professor lsaacson
is at the captain's table...

02:12.592 --> 02:17.180
<i>-...in the ship's dining salon, darling.</i>
- Thank <i>you,</i> Glacia.

02:22.685 --> 02:26.606
Good, the ship's almost against the iceberg.

02:27.398 --> 02:32.153
Get some more men, go up the ice ladders.
When the ship's secure, leap aboard.

02:32.362 --> 02:35.823
Isaacson's at the captain's table.
Bring him back here.

02:39.327 --> 02:41.788
Victory at last.

02:41.996 --> 02:48.169
Soon I'll be able to cover the entire world
with an instant ice cap.

02:49.712 --> 02:54.050
And then you say the kidnappers
disappeared back into the iceberg...

02:54.258 --> 02:58.221
...and somehow
the Gotham Queen was released.

02:59.722 --> 03:03.893
We'll ride with the wind, commissioner.
To the Batpoles.

04:26.809 --> 04:30.730
<i>NARRATOR". But while the Batmobile
glissades toward police headquarters...</i>

04:30.938 --> 04:35.151
...Mr. <i>Freeze is having his own icy sport
with Professor lsaacson.</i>

04:35.359 --> 04:40.448
Your secret formula for frozen ice, professor,
that's what I want. Where is it?

04:42.825 --> 04:44.911
You mean it isn't written down?

04:45.119 --> 04:50.249
To keep it a secret formula,
it's bottled up in here...

04:50.458 --> 04:54.128
...and memory is a strange
and intangible thing...

04:54.295 --> 04:56.839
...you frosty-faced fool.

04:57.048 --> 05:00.426
And mine won't work at your command.

05:00.635 --> 05:05.640
We'll see about that, professor.
Frosty, Chilblains?

05:05.848 --> 05:07.141
Dismantle this hideout.

05:07.767 --> 05:10.603
Remove all evidence
of our ever having been here.

05:10.812 --> 05:15.775
We'll take this perverse professor back
to Gotham City and ice him.

05:15.983 --> 05:19.946
I have a chilling scheme
by which I'll not only gain my ends...

05:20.154 --> 05:24.492
...but permanently deep-freeze
the Dynamic Duo. Go.

05:26.828 --> 05:29.580
Ha, ha. Asoulda, darling.

05:31.833 --> 05:34.001
I am going to take you with me.

05:36.921 --> 05:39.966
This little homing seal
will come in quite handy...

05:40.174 --> 05:44.262
...in my little ice escapade.

05:45.805 --> 05:51.853
Saints preserve us, who else could it be
but that ice-devil incarnate, Mr. Freeze?

05:52.019 --> 05:54.021
Nobody else, Chief O'Hara.

05:54.230 --> 05:58.025
Did you talk to the ship's captain after the
Gotham Queen made port, commissioner?

05:58.234 --> 06:00.778
And he had nothing to add
to the preposterous story...

06:00.987 --> 06:03.698
...though I may have anticipated you,
Batman.

06:03.906 --> 06:08.119
The liner's passenger list in case Mr. Freeze
had an accomplice aboard.

06:08.327 --> 06:11.581
May we take this passenger list with us?
Might provide us with a clue.

06:11.789 --> 06:13.082
To the Batcave.

06:13.291 --> 06:17.670
It looked as though we were in
for a long cold winter, commissioner.

06:17.879 --> 06:22.717
But now, I think we're due
for a sudden change in the weather.

06:22.925 --> 06:24.468
Begorra.

06:26.012 --> 06:28.681
<i>NARRATOR".
While in Mr. Freeze's present hideout...</i>

06:28.848 --> 06:32.268
<i>...directly under the rink
of the Bruce Wayne Ice</i> Arena...

06:32.935 --> 06:37.273
Darling, your ingenuity is amazing.

06:37.481 --> 06:41.527
Who else would have thought
of a hideaway here of all places?

06:42.403 --> 06:47.325
The jet nozzles in this collar keep me
permanently in a subzero temperature, Glacia...

06:47.533 --> 06:49.911
...and allow me to stay alive.

06:50.077 --> 06:53.789
But everyone functions better
in a cool environment.

06:53.998 --> 06:55.583
Speaking of cool environments...

06:55.791 --> 06:59.962
...Frosty, what does that thermometer read
in the Quick Freezer?

07:00.171 --> 07:03.758
Two hundred below, boss.
Dead on the cold nose.

07:05.760 --> 07:09.388
Professor lsaacson can't or won't reveal
his secret formula to me.

07:09.597 --> 07:14.894
- I'm freezing it out of him in the Quick Freezer.
-Oh, how lovely.

07:15.102 --> 07:18.397
Well, I must get upstairs for rehearsal.

07:19.065 --> 07:20.650
I'll be thinking of you tonight...

07:20.816 --> 07:27.031
...while I execute my famous
waltzing arabesque directly over your head.

07:37.208 --> 07:40.711
It's time for your supper, Asoulda.

07:48.260 --> 07:53.724
Soon as it's dark, I have a little errand
for you to go on. Mm?

08:04.151 --> 08:07.571
Look at the Batcomputer work
on that passenger list.

08:08.406 --> 08:09.907
Here's the passengers on C-Deck.

08:10.116 --> 08:13.035
All members
of a fireplace equipment dealer's tour.

08:13.244 --> 08:15.830
Unlikely cohorts of Mr. Freeze.

08:16.038 --> 08:20.751
What about this?
Suite A, boat deck, Collin Caldwell?

08:20.918 --> 08:24.547
Mm. An appropriate name,
but Mr. Coldwell is president...

08:24.714 --> 08:29.010
...of the Coldwell Furnace Company
and scarcely a suspect.

08:29.218 --> 08:30.344
Emma Strunk.

08:31.721 --> 08:33.847
- What was that?
-Emma Strunk, nothing there.

08:34.056 --> 08:39.061
Just a second, Robin. Emma Strunk,
I believe, was born Emma Strunk...

08:39.270 --> 08:42.188
...and later changed her name
to Glacia Glaze.

08:42.398 --> 08:44.150
- Holy ice skates.
-Exactly.

08:44.358 --> 08:46.944
A world renown skating queen.

08:47.111 --> 08:48.988
No doubt she booked passage...

08:49.196 --> 08:53.075
...under the name of Emma Strunk
in order to avoid publicity.

08:53.284 --> 08:57.204
Once on board of course,
she would have been recognized.

08:57.413 --> 09:00.875
Yes, old chum, I have a strange feeling...

09:01.083 --> 09:05.337
That Glacia Glaze was Mr. Freeze's accomplice
on the Gotham Queen.

09:05.546 --> 09:09.633
But what would a talented, beautiful,
famous star like Glacia Glaze...

09:09.842 --> 09:11.844
...see in frostbitten Freeze?

09:12.053 --> 09:17.349
The famous Rabelais has already answered
that for you, Robin, with his great wit.

09:17.558 --> 09:24.273
"To each his own,"
as the woman said when she kissed her cow.

09:25.399 --> 09:28.402
Gosh, Batman,
that's sure great wit, all right.

09:30.196 --> 09:35.201
And this could be just the break
we and Bruce Wayne are looking for.

09:35.409 --> 09:38.162
- Bruce Wayne?
-Ms. Glaze is opening...

09:38.370 --> 09:41.290
...in a new ice revue tonight
at the Bruce Wayne Ice Arena.

09:41.499 --> 09:45.753
In fact, Mr. Wayne
is taking Mrs. Harriet Cooper...

09:45.920 --> 09:48.506
...a devotee of Ms. Glaze's...

09:48.714 --> 09:54.637
...backstage before the performance
to meet the dazzling star.

09:54.845 --> 09:58.766
While Dick Grayson, I suppose, stays home
and works on his essay on glaciers?

09:58.974 --> 10:00.226
Right again, Robin.

10:01.852 --> 10:04.647
Bonnie, the next time
you send in an unannounced visitor...

10:04.855 --> 10:07.817
...you'd better send a tank of water
and some live fish along with him.

10:09.652 --> 10:12.446
But this was attached to one of its flippers.

10:12.655 --> 10:16.033
Suffering icicles,
it's a list of demands from Mr. Freeze.

10:16.242 --> 10:18.327
He's holding Professor lsaacson
for ransom.

10:18.536 --> 10:21.705
At midnight, millionaire Bruce Wayne,
head of the Wayne Foundation...

10:21.872 --> 10:24.583
...is to make a televised broadcast--
-From this office.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.502
that the money is ready to be paid.

10:26.669 --> 10:29.505
He'll only deal directly
with Batman and Robin.

10:29.713 --> 10:34.009
They're to be ready at midnight too
to act as intermediaries, otherwise--

10:34.218 --> 10:38.722
Otherwise it may be the blackest midnight
that Gotham City has ever known, Chief O'Hara.

10:38.889 --> 10:40.474
I'll call Batman on the red phone.

10:40.641 --> 10:42.518
- You get Mr. Wayne on the other.
-Right.

10:52.862 --> 10:54.613
Yes, commissioner?

10:55.406 --> 10:57.241
Mr. Freeze wants what?

11:00.244 --> 11:05.583
Hello? I'll see if I can get him, Chief O'Hara.

11:06.625 --> 11:09.003
A moment, commissioner.

11:10.462 --> 11:13.257
Chief O'Hara, this is Bruce Wayne.

11:15.092 --> 11:17.136
Mr. Freeze wants what?

11:17.344 --> 11:20.973
Commissioner Gordon is on the other phone
with Batman, Mr. Wayne.

11:21.182 --> 11:25.436
Perhaps if we put the two phones together,
you could talk to him yourself.

11:26.020 --> 11:28.564
All right, chief. I don't have much time.

11:33.527 --> 11:36.780
Batman? Yes, Mr. Wayne.

11:36.989 --> 11:39.283
Have you heard Mr. Freeze's
scurrilous demands?

11:39.491 --> 11:40.659
Just briefly.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.745
If Robin and I act as go-betweens...

11:42.953 --> 11:46.832
...are you prepared to make the telecast
at midnight and pay the ransom, Mr. Wayne?

11:47.041 --> 11:49.210
I have no choice, Batman.

11:49.376 --> 11:52.421
I suggest you tape the broadcast
from the commissioner's office...

11:52.630 --> 11:57.092
...an <i>hour earlier and we will have
a dummy package of money.</i>

11:58.093 --> 12:01.639
A dummy package of money.
That sounds risky.

12:01.847 --> 12:04.016
Risk is our business, Mr. Wayne.

12:04.225 --> 12:09.063
Of course, Batman, I have the same faith in you
that all of Gotham City has.

12:09.271 --> 12:12.441
I hope Robin and I
are deserving of that faith.

12:12.650 --> 12:16.111
I'll make the arrangements and meet you
at the commissioner's office at 11.

12:16.278 --> 12:17.363
Fine.

12:17.571 --> 12:21.200
<i>- Did you get all that, commissioner?
-Indeed</i> I <i>did, Batman.</i>

12:21.408 --> 12:24.912
We'll set up the taped telecast and have
the dummy package of money waiting.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.373
See you at 11 tonight.

12:29.041 --> 12:35.130
Two fine men,
so dissimilar in many respects, and yet...

12:35.297 --> 12:38.217
Yet so similar in others.

12:42.638 --> 12:43.889
<i>NARRATOR".
And presently...</i>

12:44.056 --> 12:47.851
<i>...backstage at the Ice Arena,
in the dressing room of Glacia Glaze...</i>

12:48.060 --> 12:49.812
...nee, <i>Emma</i> Strunk...

12:50.020 --> 12:53.649
I'm about to go on, darling.
What's happening?

12:53.857 --> 12:56.819
Nothing will happen until midnight, Glacia.

12:57.027 --> 13:00.406
But if Wayne agrees to my terms
and Batman and Robin deliver the money...

13:00.614 --> 13:03.200
...everything's in the ice bag.

13:03.409 --> 13:07.955
And do I have a chilling clincher
for the Caped Crusaders.

13:08.163 --> 13:10.124
Oh, I'll bet you do.

13:10.332 --> 13:12.876
Have you frozen
the professor's formula out of him?

13:13.085 --> 13:16.171
We're about to remove the professor
from the Quick Freezer now.

13:18.841 --> 13:24.680
Hello, Glacia? Glacia?
What happened to this thing?

13:27.474 --> 13:30.102
Mr. Wayne couldn't find
the stage manager, Glacia.

13:30.311 --> 13:32.771
I offered to bring him and Mrs. Cooper
to your room.

13:32.938 --> 13:34.315
Thank you, Carol.

13:34.523 --> 13:39.236
How nice to meet you both, but I'm afraid
things are a little chaotic around here.

13:39.445 --> 13:42.906
Your whole day sounded chaotic, Ms. Glaze.
Weren't you on the Gotham Queen?

13:43.657 --> 13:48.078
A ghastly experience, Mr. Wayne.
I'd rather not talk about it.

13:48.287 --> 13:49.663
Of course.

13:49.872 --> 13:55.294
But how lovely you look.
And such a pretty dressing room.

13:55.919 --> 13:59.965
Oh, my, what a darling compact.

14:00.174 --> 14:02.760
<i>FREEZE". Glacia? Glacia, what happened?
I was in the mid--</i>

14:02.968 --> 14:04.470
It talked.

14:04.678 --> 14:07.056
Again? What is wrong with this instrument?

14:07.765 --> 14:10.309
No, Mrs. Cooper, the compact didn't talk.

14:10.517 --> 14:14.021
It's a little music box
I picked up in Switzerland.

14:14.229 --> 14:19.151
But now, if you'll excuse me,
I must get out to the wings.

14:22.696 --> 14:25.282
This thing must be broken.

14:27.868 --> 14:31.246
Frosty, Chilblains?

14:32.456 --> 14:34.875
Remove the professor.

14:35.876 --> 14:39.546
He should be stone cold by now.

14:44.551 --> 14:50.432
- You're not even chilly.
-I'm an lcelander, you frostbitten baboon.

14:51.392 --> 14:55.771
A slight drop in temperature
makes little difference to me.

14:56.939 --> 15:00.401
Well, something will make a difference to you,
professor.

15:00.609 --> 15:05.155
I'm going to get this formula out of you
one way or the other. Down.

15:07.533 --> 15:11.370
Get me my dry ice injector.

15:13.330 --> 15:17.918
That's our cue, Carol.
Thank you both for coming backstage.

15:18.127 --> 15:22.047
- And we certainly hope you enjoy the show.
-Thank you, we will.

15:22.256 --> 15:25.884
Let's hurry to our box, Bruce.
I don't wanna miss a minute.

15:26.093 --> 15:29.555
I have a call to make, Aunt Harriet.
I'll join you shortly.

15:49.616 --> 15:50.659
Excuse me, Mr. Wayne.

15:50.826 --> 15:54.705
The telephone call you were expecting
you can take in the foyer of your box.

16:14.349 --> 16:16.852
- Dick?
-Yes, Bruce.

16:17.060 --> 16:20.522
I slipped an anti-eavesdrop
Bat-plug into the telephone just in case.

16:20.689 --> 16:22.024
I suggest you do the same.

16:22.232 --> 16:24.776
I already have, and I've done what you said.

16:24.985 --> 16:26.195
Went down to the Batcave.

16:26.361 --> 16:29.323
Got the Remote Batmobile
Control Phase Advanoer.

16:29.531 --> 16:31.325
Went up my Bat-pole, called a cab...

16:31.492 --> 16:34.870
...and I'm in a phone booth in the back
of police headquarters right now.

16:35.037 --> 16:37.915
Good. Activate the Remote Control
Phase Advanoer.

16:38.123 --> 16:41.210
Bring the Batmobile into town
and have it parked in that alley.

16:41.418 --> 16:45.088
There's some red lockers outside
of Commissioner Gordon's office.

16:45.297 --> 16:48.091
Put the Bat clothes in one of them.

16:48.300 --> 16:52.262
I'll meet you at 10:55.
Alfred will take care of Aunt Harriet.

16:52.471 --> 16:54.181
Right.

17:12.782 --> 17:15.702
This is Bruce Wayne, Mr. Freeze.
We've received your message.

17:15.911 --> 17:21.708
And Batman and Robin will make the delivery,
when, where, how and if you so advise us.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.752
In return, we depend on you
to keep your part of the bargain...

17:24.920 --> 17:30.175
...and release Professor lsaacson
to the Caped Crusaders. Good evening.

17:30.759 --> 17:34.263
Thank you, gentlemen,
for a difficult task well done.

17:34.471 --> 17:36.306
You sounded like an old pro, Mr. Wayne.

17:36.515 --> 17:40.978
An old pro, at paying a large ransom
to that contemptible kidnapper?

17:41.186 --> 17:44.106
It's only dummy money, Mr. Wayne,
as Batman suggested.

17:44.314 --> 17:46.817
Yes, I wonder why.
I also wonder where he is.

17:47.025 --> 17:50.445
I've done my job and he told me himself
he would be here.

17:50.654 --> 17:53.073
Well, he will, Mr. Wayne.
No doubt about it.

17:53.282 --> 17:54.575
Probably delayed in traffic.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.994
You can always depend
on the Caped Crusaders.

17:57.202 --> 18:00.706
Yes, I trust that's it.
Dick, I think we should go now.

18:00.914 --> 18:04.418
You'll let us know what happens, gentlemen?
Excuse us.

18:09.047 --> 18:12.843
He sounded rather unlike himself.
So brisk and brief.

18:13.051 --> 18:17.014
Pressure, commissioner, gets us all.

18:20.058 --> 18:22.269
- Ah, here you are.
-Good evening. Where's Mr. Wayne?

18:22.436 --> 18:25.063
He just left.
Didn't you bump into him in the hall?

18:25.272 --> 18:26.898
- No.
-Well, that's strange.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.985
Anyway, he pre-taped his telecast
and here's the dummy money.

18:30.193 --> 18:31.862
Good.

18:32.362 --> 18:34.281
- Well, Robin, the Bat-ropes?
-You bet.

18:34.448 --> 18:36.783
The Batmobile's in the rear alley.
We'll save time.

18:36.950 --> 18:39.786
Aren't you gonna stay
until Mr. Freeze hears the broadcast...

18:39.953 --> 18:41.830
...and advises us of the payoff site?

18:42.039 --> 18:45.334
I believe we already have a clue
as to his whereabouts, commissioner.

18:45.542 --> 18:49.796
And the midnight broadcast may enable us
to take him by surprise.

18:50.005 --> 18:52.883
Commissioner, when you called earlier...

18:53.091 --> 18:58.221
...you mentioned something about
the ransom note being delivered by a seal.

18:58.430 --> 19:00.390
Right. He flipped right in here.

19:01.767 --> 19:03.143
Where is the seal?

19:03.310 --> 19:06.104
In a bathtub down the hall. Why, Batman?

19:07.314 --> 19:11.735
Take this. It's a small echoing seal pulsator.

19:13.570 --> 19:15.739
It may come in handy later.

19:27.626 --> 19:30.754
- What goes on around here?
-Just be calm, citizen.

19:30.962 --> 19:34.633
I'm no citizen. I'm here from London
for a manufacturers convention.

19:34.841 --> 19:38.512
- Then welcome, sir, to Gotham City.
-You must be that gentleman I've read about.

19:38.679 --> 19:42.432
- Aren't you a king or something?
-Robin, England has no king now.

19:42.641 --> 19:45.227
England has a Queen
and a great lady she is too.

19:45.435 --> 19:49.022
Yes, that she is.
But in a way, the lad is right.

19:49.231 --> 19:52.526
I am sometimes called the King,
Carpet King, that is.

19:52.734 --> 19:55.112
- Holy floor covering.
- Very apt, Robin.

19:55.320 --> 19:59.157
And speaking of floors, I think we should
be dropping down a few more right now.

19:59.366 --> 20:01.243
Good evening, sir.

20:05.330 --> 20:09.835
We have second story men in England,
but this is ridiculous.

20:13.004 --> 20:15.048
Frosty, Chilblains?

20:18.009 --> 20:20.095
Put the professor in the Quick Freezer.

20:20.303 --> 20:24.683
With his veins full of dry ice,
something may happen.

20:29.396 --> 20:32.065
Ah, Glacia.

20:32.274 --> 20:34.818
The audience just wouldn't let me go,
darling.

20:35.026 --> 20:38.238
My famous Waltzing arabesques
were better than ever...

20:38.447 --> 20:43.910
...but I just had to be here with you at midnight
to watch millionaire Bruce Wayne's broadcast.

20:44.119 --> 20:46.872
Just one minute to go.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.460
Let's warm this thing up.

20:51.626 --> 20:54.421
If you'll excuse the expression.

20:59.634 --> 21:01.887
<i>This is Bruce Wayne, Mr. Freeze.</i>

21:02.095 --> 21:05.515
<i>We've received your message and
Batman and Robin will make the delivery...</i>

21:05.724 --> 21:08.351
<i>...when, where, how and if you so advise us.</i>

21:08.560 --> 21:13.732
- Are making the delivery and right now.
-Switch it off.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.650
How could you have found us here?

21:15.859 --> 21:18.111
I have not yet called
the Commissioner Gordon.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.405
Found you we have.

21:20.697 --> 21:22.491
Here's the money.

21:29.372 --> 21:32.042
- Phony.
-As phony as you, Mr. Freeze?

21:32.250 --> 21:34.085
The gun.

21:36.004 --> 21:38.590
- Your Freeze Gun is useless.
-Ha-ha-ha.

21:42.886 --> 21:46.139
Thanks to the super-thermalized
Bat-skivvies we're wearing.

21:46.348 --> 21:47.974
Skivvies?

21:50.519 --> 21:52.771
Icemen, to the attack!

22:25.804 --> 22:28.640
Push them into the Quick Freezer
with the professor.

22:34.813 --> 22:39.317
Better yet, toss them into
the vaporizing transparent pipe pump.

23:02.757 --> 23:06.136
Ah, ha, ha! Follow me, icemen.

23:12.684 --> 23:15.478
Now, Glacia...

23:18.023 --> 23:22.569
...all I have to do is turn on
the sub-zero temperature gauge.

23:24.446 --> 23:27.324
And when they've cooled down a little...

23:27.490 --> 23:31.119
...I will activate the vaporizing pipe pump...

23:31.286 --> 23:36.041
...and evaporate the caped double-crossers
directly under the ice...

23:36.249 --> 23:38.752
...of the Bruce Wayne Ice Arena.

23:38.960 --> 23:43.632
Imagine, Glacia, being able
to do your famous Waltzing arabesques...

23:43.840 --> 23:48.303
...directly on Batman and Robin.

23:48.678 --> 23:54.017
Behold, they are beginning
to frost up already!
