00:01.302 --> 00:02.203
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:02.836 --> 00:03.837
sexually based offenses

00:03.871 --> 00:06.340
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.374 --> 00:08.542
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.576 --> 00:10.378
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.411 --> 00:12.113
are members of an elite squad

00:12.146 --> 00:14.048
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.082 --> 00:16.384
These are their stories.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.455
[line trills]
- Hi. You've reached Nicole.

00:21.489 --> 00:23.457
Please leave a message
after the tone. Thanks.

00:23.491 --> 00:26.427
[line beeps]
- Mom, it's me again.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.329
Where are you?

00:28.362 --> 00:31.432
I keep calling and calling.

00:31.465 --> 00:34.802
Dad and I got in a fight.

00:34.835 --> 00:36.570
I'm almost home.

00:36.604 --> 00:39.573
Why aren't you picking up?

00:43.577 --> 00:45.246
Thank you.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.425
Mom?

00:57.458 --> 00:59.560

[gunshot]

02:14.502 --> 02:15.303
[siren wails]

02:15.336 --> 02:17.238
- Detective Perry, Homicide?
- Yeah.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.439
Lieutenant Benson, SVU.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.740
- Thanks for getting here
so fast.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.209
- So, what we looking at?

02:21.242 --> 02:23.377
- DOA is Trey Franklin, 15.

02:23.411 --> 02:25.279
Rifle shot to the head,
close range.

02:25.313 --> 02:27.681
- You said the shooter
interrupted a rape?

02:27.715 --> 02:29.583
- Yeah. Luke Keller, also 15.

02:29.617 --> 02:32.620
Saw Franklin assaulting
his mother, Nicole Keller--

02:32.653 --> 02:34.622
Dr. Nicole Keller, 45.

02:34.655 --> 02:35.589
- Did you keep them separated?

02:35.623 --> 02:37.391
- Yep. We secured the scene
and the weapon,

02:37.425 --> 02:38.359
took the kid's
initial statements.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.294
He's upstairs.
The mother's in the living room.

02:40.328 --> 02:41.562
- Okay, so we'll take
the disclosure.

02:41.595 --> 02:42.696
- That's why I called you guys.

02:42.730 --> 02:44.565
- All right.
Rollins, you're with me.

02:44.598 --> 02:45.933
Fin, Carisi.

02:45.966 --> 02:47.668
- We'll take the son.

02:49.270 --> 02:52.306
- Luke, I'm Detective Carisi.
This is Detective Tutuola.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.574
- I already told
the other police.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.409
I had to do it.
He was raping my mom.

02:55.443 --> 02:58.412
- Okay, just breathe. We just
want to know what happened.

02:58.446 --> 03:00.681
- I was supposed
to spend the night at my dad's,

03:00.714 --> 03:02.716
but we got in a fight,
so I came home.

03:02.750 --> 03:06.454
- What time did you leave?
- I left my dad's about 9:00.

03:06.487 --> 03:08.289
I really wanted
to talk to my mom.

03:08.322 --> 03:10.224
I tried calling.
She wasn't answering.

03:10.258 --> 03:12.293
- Luke, now, did your mother
have plans tonight?

03:12.326 --> 03:14.562
- Staying home, doing paperwork.

03:14.595 --> 03:15.729
She's a psychiatrist.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.331
- What time did you get home?

03:17.365 --> 03:18.566
- About 10:00. It was dark.

03:18.599 --> 03:21.435
I heard a noise downstairs,
thought someone was breaking in,

03:21.469 --> 03:24.572
so I called 911, and then went
to the closet to get my rifle.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.574
- Your rifle?

03:26.607 --> 03:28.342
- Yeah.
My dad gave it to me.

03:28.376 --> 03:29.443
He likes to go hunting.

03:29.477 --> 03:31.579
- Then what happened?
- I walked into the kitchen,

03:31.612 --> 03:33.581
and he was attacking my mom.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.516
- What did you see?
- She was staring at me.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.719
She was so scared. Then she
screamed "Help! He's raping me!"

03:38.752 --> 03:40.621
so I pulled the trigger.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.590
I didn't think I was
actually gonna hit him.

03:42.623 --> 03:43.691
[sobs]

03:43.724 --> 03:44.792
- I have to see my son.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.594
He can't handle this stress.

03:46.627 --> 03:47.595
He's got a lot
of generalized anxiety.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.630
- And I understand that,
but right now we need

03:49.663 --> 03:50.831
to speak to both of you
separately.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.766
- Right. Okay.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.335
- Okay.
- I understand.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.470
- So, Dr. Keller,
I need to know

03:56.504 --> 03:58.739
exactly what happened

03:58.772 --> 04:00.474
from your perspective.

04:00.508 --> 04:03.311
- Okay. Um, right.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.613
I was in the kitchen.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.481
I was--I was getting some wine.

04:07.515 --> 04:10.484
And he--I was there,
and I turn around,

04:10.518 --> 04:11.785
and--and he was right there.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.754
And I tried to get away.

04:13.787 --> 04:16.657
I did. I tried.
And he--he overpowered me.

04:16.690 --> 04:19.293
- Was this a break-in?
Or maybe he followed you home?

04:19.327 --> 04:21.429
- No. No. I let him in.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.466
- You let him in?

04:25.499 --> 04:27.635
So you knew him?

04:27.668 --> 04:29.303
- Yes.

04:29.337 --> 04:31.372
He was my son's best friend.

04:31.405 --> 04:38.446
*

04:39.447 --> 04:42.416
[dramatic music]

05:26.494 --> 05:27.227
- The mother let him in
voluntarily.

05:28.061 --> 05:30.864
She said he was
the son's best friend.

05:30.898 --> 05:33.401
- Explains why there's no signs
of forced entry.

05:34.902 --> 05:37.104
- Okay, if Luke wasn't home,
why did she let him in?

05:37.137 --> 05:39.973
- [sighs] He asked to come in
to do his homework.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.042
Apparently he's been having
a rough time at home.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.444
- So, he just hung out
in the house

05:43.477 --> 05:44.478
while she was upstairs working?

05:44.512 --> 05:46.013
- That's what she said.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.048
- Okay, so, Luke walks in
unexpectedly,

05:48.081 --> 05:50.083
hears his mother screaming
that she's being raped,

05:50.117 --> 05:52.119
and he fires.

05:52.152 --> 05:54.422
We're not thinking
premeditation at all?

05:54.455 --> 05:55.989
- He called 911.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.426
The rifle was locked up.
Registered to his father,

05:58.459 --> 05:59.993
so technically not legal,

06:00.027 --> 06:02.796
but the shooting still sounds
justifiable to me.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.465
But I'm a cop, not a prosecutor.

06:04.498 --> 06:09.136
- Okay, what about the DOA?
I mean, Trey Franklin's parents.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.439
- On their way
to the ME's office.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.407
How about if I meet
one of your guys over there?

06:13.441 --> 06:15.075
- Good idea.
Thanks.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.180
Is it okay if we pick up
where we left off?

06:20.213 --> 06:22.015
- Yeah. Sure.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.518
- Dr. Keller,
you said that you knew

06:24.552 --> 06:26.153
that you shouldn't have
let Trey in.

06:26.186 --> 06:28.822
- I had an instinct.
Something was wrong.

06:28.856 --> 06:33.126
The way he looked at me,
you know? Made me uneasy.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.529
- But you were okay with him
being friends with your son?

06:35.563 --> 06:38.131
- Yes. I didn't want
to shut Trey out.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.500
I felt badly for him.

06:39.533 --> 06:42.169
His family life was
very unstable.

06:42.202 --> 06:45.906
- So, Trey came to your door
at what time?

06:45.939 --> 06:48.442
- Uh, it was around 9:00.

06:48.476 --> 06:50.143
Nine o'clock.

06:50.177 --> 06:53.180
Uh, I put my work away
for the night.

06:53.213 --> 06:56.183
And he asked where Luke was,

06:56.216 --> 06:57.518
said they were supposed
to study.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.487
And I said,
"There must be a mix-up,

06:59.520 --> 07:02.055
'cause Luke's at his father's
house in Westport."

07:02.089 --> 07:06.794
- Okay. Go on.

07:06.827 --> 07:10.464
- Then he asked if he could--
if he could come in anyway,

07:10.498 --> 07:11.632
do his homework.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.200
And...[sighs]

07:13.233 --> 07:14.602
I said yes.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.937
And then I went upstairs
to get ready for bed.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.806
- So, that's when you changed
into your nightgown?

07:18.839 --> 07:20.140
- No. I already had
my nightgown on,

07:20.173 --> 07:22.175
and I'd already started
getting ready for bed

07:22.209 --> 07:23.243
when he rang the doorbell.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.845
- Okay, so,
you answered the door

07:24.878 --> 07:27.548
in your nightgown,
and then you went back upstairs.

07:27.581 --> 07:31.084
- Yes. I-I went upstairs
for about an hour.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.253
It started getting late,

07:33.286 --> 07:36.557
so I-I went back downstairs

07:36.590 --> 07:40.628
and I told Trey--I told him
it was time to go home.

07:40.661 --> 07:44.097
- So, during that time,
your son was calling you.

07:44.131 --> 07:47.200
Um, why didn't you pick up?

07:47.234 --> 07:50.571
- No, I didn't get the message.
I didn't get any messages.

07:50.604 --> 07:53.273
I--when I work sometimes
I don't even look at my phone,

07:53.306 --> 07:54.207
and Luke was with his dad.

07:54.241 --> 07:56.109
- Right, but you weren't
working then, right?

07:56.143 --> 07:59.980
Because he started to call
I think at 9:30 to 10:00, right?

08:00.013 --> 08:02.182
You had already put your work
down for the night?

08:02.215 --> 08:05.152
- Right. Yes, I had. I went
downstairs for a glass of wine.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.319
- Oh.
- Okay? To relax.

08:06.353 --> 08:11.992
And that's when I felt him--
I felt his presence behind me,

08:12.025 --> 08:13.994
and I turned around,
and it was Trey.

08:14.027 --> 08:14.995
He was right there.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.564
And he put his hands on me.

08:16.597 --> 08:19.266
- So, what did you do?
- I tried to stop it.

08:19.299 --> 08:21.569
I tried to tell him
I understood.

08:21.602 --> 08:25.305
I understood sexual impulses
and urges.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.874
Believe me.
I'm a psychiatrist.

08:26.907 --> 08:29.543
I've dealt with this issue
many, many times.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.645
But he...

08:31.679 --> 08:35.949
put me up against
the kitchen counter, and...

08:35.983 --> 08:38.185
he lifted up my nightgown.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.655
- Okay.
Take your time.

08:44.124 --> 08:47.160
- I, uh...
[stammering]

08:50.664 --> 08:52.199
He forced himself inside me,

08:52.232 --> 08:54.101
and, um,

08:54.134 --> 08:56.036
I-I tried to scream,

08:56.069 --> 08:58.138
and he put his hand on my mouth.

08:58.171 --> 09:01.308
And I--[sobs]
There was a kitchen knife,

09:01.341 --> 09:05.579
and I tried to reach it,
but it was too far away.

09:05.613 --> 09:08.582
So I just closed my eyes,
and I tried to survive.

09:08.616 --> 09:11.318
And I thought about my son.

09:11.351 --> 09:12.586
I thought about Luke,

09:12.620 --> 09:16.657
and I needed to stay alive
for him.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.358
And then--and then I looked up,
and he was there,

09:18.391 --> 09:21.028
and I yelled help: "Help!"

09:21.061 --> 09:23.597
- Mm. Mm-hmm.

09:23.631 --> 09:25.098
- And then I heard the gunshot.

09:25.132 --> 09:28.636
- So, Mrs. Keller,
did you know that your son

09:28.669 --> 09:29.637
had a rifle in the house?

09:29.670 --> 09:33.641
- Yes. In a locked safe. Yes.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.943
It was a gift--it was a gift
from his father.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.077
He's a hunter.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.746
- Okay. Is Luke a hunter, too?

09:38.779 --> 09:42.716
- No. He--he's so sensitive.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.688
He actually hated the idea
of having a gun in the house.

09:47.721 --> 09:50.691
Hated it.

09:50.724 --> 09:56.229
He went hunting, and there was
a deer in his sight,

09:56.263 --> 09:58.265
and he couldn't even
pull the trigger.

10:01.669 --> 10:05.072
I--

10:05.105 --> 10:06.640
it doesn't--

10:06.674 --> 10:08.108
it doesn't make sense.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.277
It--it doesn't make sense.

10:10.310 --> 10:14.414
That's why it's so--

10:14.447 --> 10:17.651
I want to see him.

10:17.685 --> 10:20.120
- Is my mom gonna be okay?

10:20.153 --> 10:22.222
- Yeah.
Yeah, she's at the hospital.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.758
She's--she's getting
checked out now. Come on.

10:24.792 --> 10:27.327
I know what you went through.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.262
I know it's tough,
all right?

10:29.296 --> 10:31.064
Have a seat.

10:31.098 --> 10:33.801
But we need to go over it again,
step by step.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.402
Can you do that?

10:35.435 --> 10:37.170
- Think so.

10:37.204 --> 10:38.305
- Okay.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.207
So, you said you walked
into your house,

10:40.240 --> 10:41.742
you heard noises,
you called 911,

10:41.775 --> 10:43.343
you grabbed your rifle,

10:43.376 --> 10:45.245
walked down to the kitchen,
right?

10:45.278 --> 10:47.114
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, Luke.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.783
Before you fired, did you say
"stop" or "get off of her,"

10:49.817 --> 10:51.018
or anything like that?

10:51.051 --> 10:52.720
- I don't think so.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.855
I just reacted.

10:54.888 --> 10:57.858
- When did you realize
it was Trey?

10:57.891 --> 10:59.459
- Not until after.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.429
I thought it was just some man
who broke in, not Trey.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.264
- How well did you guys
know each other?

11:04.297 --> 11:07.067
- We're best friends.

11:09.202 --> 11:10.804
We were.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.776
I killed my best friend.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.310
- Okay.
We're gonna take a break.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.112
We'll get you some water.

11:19.146 --> 11:21.314
- Luke's dad is here.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.350
- Luke, you all right?

11:23.383 --> 11:25.152
- [crying] Dad!

11:25.185 --> 11:27.487
- Hey, hey, hey.
- He was hurting Mom. I swear.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.757
- It's okay. It's okay.
I'm here now.

11:32.492 --> 11:35.062
Uh, do I need a lawyer?

11:35.095 --> 11:37.464
- We're still investigating,
but it seems like Luke fired

11:37.497 --> 11:40.200
to save his mother
from a sexual assault.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.135
That being said,
these cases can get tricky.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.804
- Appreciate your honesty.
We're done talking.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.806
- It's all right, buddy.
Come here.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.340
It's all right.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.877
Everything's gonna be okay,
all right?

11:53.881 --> 11:56.083
- Yeah, that's his bracelet.

11:56.116 --> 11:59.352
And the scar.
He burnt his hand

11:59.386 --> 12:01.121
on a camping trip
when he was ten.

12:01.154 --> 12:03.891
- [crying] I want to see him.
I want to see my son's body.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.492
- Mrs. Franklin, ma'am.

12:05.525 --> 12:08.195
It's better that you don't.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.863
- I still don't understand
what happened.

12:09.897 --> 12:12.766
- A classmate of his,
Luke Keller,

12:12.800 --> 12:13.934
he fired a weapon.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.468
The bullet struck
and killed him.

12:15.502 --> 12:18.438
- Luke?
That doesn't make any sense.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.507
They're--they're friends.
- Was it an accident?

12:20.540 --> 12:22.242
- We're still looking into it.

12:22.275 --> 12:26.246
But Luke's mother says your son
was sexually assaulting her.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.848
- What?

12:27.881 --> 12:29.349
And that's why Luke shot him?

12:29.382 --> 12:30.517
- It's possible.

12:30.550 --> 12:34.121
- No. No. It's not possible!

12:34.154 --> 12:36.824
Trey would never assault anyone.
Ever.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.558
- You may be right.
It's obviously very early

12:38.591 --> 12:39.893
in the investigation.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.494
- Is Luke under arrest?

12:41.528 --> 12:44.297
- Not yet.
- Oh, I see.

12:44.331 --> 12:46.867
White kid shoots black kid,
got to be the black kid's fault.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.168
That's what you're saying?

12:48.201 --> 12:49.502
- No. Not even close.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.805
We're just trying to figure out
what happened.

12:51.839 --> 12:54.274
- Yeah, well, me too,

12:54.307 --> 12:57.544
'cause my son was a good kid.

12:57.577 --> 13:01.548
No. A great kid.

13:01.581 --> 13:05.385
- I want to see my son. Now.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.288
- Okay.

13:12.860 --> 13:17.564
*

13:17.597 --> 13:18.966
[knocks on glass]

13:20.267 --> 13:27.307
*

13:42.522 --> 13:44.224
- What do we know
about Trey Franklin?

13:44.257 --> 13:47.594
- Only son of Charles
and Regina Franklin.

13:47.627 --> 13:50.630
Father's an English professor.
Mother is an oncology nurse.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.599
No priors. Good student.

13:52.632 --> 13:54.902
He started high school
at Manor Hill in September.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.904
- Rape kit?
- There's no semen.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.939
Just a few minor abrasions.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.640
- How long did the mother
know Trey?

14:00.673 --> 14:02.409
- A few months.
She said she didn't mind

14:02.442 --> 14:03.610
her son being friends with Trey,

14:03.643 --> 14:05.946
but she had a bad feeling
about him from the beginning,

14:05.979 --> 14:07.347
whatever that means.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.648
- Because he's black?

14:08.681 --> 14:11.384
- No. I didn't get a sense
that it was racial.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.553
- And Luke.
Do you believe his story?

14:13.586 --> 14:15.355
- I do.
He's taking this hard.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.657
He had no clue the alleged
rapist was his friend.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.961
- But firing the rifle was the
only way to stop the assault?

14:20.994 --> 14:22.629
- He panicked.
He was trying to scare

14:22.662 --> 14:23.663
whoever he thought it was away.

14:23.696 --> 14:27.234
- Okay, so they were friends.
Any recent problems?

14:27.267 --> 14:28.936
- Not that we can find.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.403
- So, Trey came over
to study with Luke,

14:30.437 --> 14:31.972
but Luke wasn't there.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.974
If Trey knew
that Luke wasn't gonna be home,

14:34.007 --> 14:35.542
that would help to establish
his mindset.

14:35.575 --> 14:39.312
Then he went to Nicole's house
knowing she was gonna be alone.

14:39.346 --> 14:40.981
- But we already checked
Luke's phone.

14:41.014 --> 14:43.450
There's no texts or emails
between him and Trey.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.652
- Okay, so let's dig in
to their social media account,

14:45.685 --> 14:47.687
talk to the friends,
see if we can find anything out.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.090
- We should search his locker
and his bedroom, too.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.658
- I'll get some warrants.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.026
- Thanks.

14:55.562 --> 14:59.499
- You want Trey's computer?
- All electronic devices.

14:59.532 --> 15:02.035
- And what about Luke?
Have you arrested him yet?

15:02.069 --> 15:03.570
- We're still investigating,
Mr. Franklin.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.005
That's why we're here.

15:05.038 --> 15:07.307
- We're also gonna need
to search Trey's room.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.409
- You're acting
like my son's the killer.

15:09.442 --> 15:10.978
This is outrageous!

15:11.011 --> 15:12.679
- Just let them go.

15:12.712 --> 15:14.481
They're not gonna find anything.

15:16.149 --> 15:17.985
- Fifteen's a crazy age.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.686
Testosterone, impulses.

15:19.719 --> 15:23.957
- Yeah, but you don't just wake
up one morning out of the blue

15:23.991 --> 15:26.693
and decide
to rape your buddy's mom.

15:26.726 --> 15:29.629
I don't know.
There's--

15:29.662 --> 15:31.698
there's something else
going on here.

15:31.731 --> 15:34.734
I don't know. Everything here,
though, looks good.

15:34.767 --> 15:38.638
There's no weed. No booze.

15:38.671 --> 15:43.143
The only thing wrong is maybe
a couple of dirty socks.

15:43.176 --> 15:45.712
- Check this out.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.550
- That's the mother?

15:50.583 --> 15:52.319
Dr. Keller?

15:59.326 --> 15:59.792
- Imagine our surprise.

16:01.228 --> 16:03.363
- Imagine my surprise.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.465
I had a sense Trey was
stalking me, but now I know.

16:05.498 --> 16:08.701
- You had a sense
Trey was stalking you?

16:08.735 --> 16:12.139
Well, that's very different
from having a bad feeling.

16:12.172 --> 16:15.142
- I wasn't sure, but I am now.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.144
- That's you in the photo,
correct?

16:17.177 --> 16:20.247
- Yes! Eyes closed. Asleep.

16:20.280 --> 16:23.516
Unaware this adult teenager was
taking pictures.

16:23.550 --> 16:25.018
- You mind if we take a look
around?

16:25.052 --> 16:26.319
- Of course not.

16:28.221 --> 16:30.257
- So, just to be clear,

16:30.290 --> 16:33.160
you're saying that Trey walked
up these stairs,

16:33.193 --> 16:36.063
he hopped onto your bed
while you were sleeping,

16:36.096 --> 16:38.198
and he took these photos.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.167
- Well, that's the only thing
that makes sense.

16:40.200 --> 16:44.437
- No. There are other
plausible explanations.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.373
- Do you always sleep naked?

16:46.406 --> 16:47.207
- Sometimes.

16:47.240 --> 16:50.277
Sometimes I sleep
in a nightgown.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.479
Sometimes I sleep
in a Rolling Stones t-shirt.

16:54.281 --> 16:56.549
Are you suggesting I had sex
with that boy?

16:56.583 --> 16:57.684
- Oh, I'm not suggesting
anything.

16:57.717 --> 17:01.454
I'm simply asking why you
and Trey were in bed together,

17:01.488 --> 17:03.456
naked.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.225
- Because he was
obsessed with me

17:05.258 --> 17:06.426
and snuck into my bed.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.228
- And you didn't wake up?

17:08.261 --> 17:10.097
You must be a sound sleeper.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.199
- I am.
Last few months, anyway.

17:12.232 --> 17:13.766
I've been on sleep medication.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.735
- You said you thought
Trey was stalking you.

17:15.768 --> 17:16.969
If that's true,
why did you give him

17:17.003 --> 17:20.140
so much access to your house,
invite him in at 9:00 p.m.?

17:20.173 --> 17:23.276
- Like I said,
I was trying to help him.

17:23.310 --> 17:24.511
- Because of his troubled
home life?

17:24.544 --> 17:27.147
Well, we talked to his parents.
There's no evidence of that.

17:30.183 --> 17:32.752
- Some of my patients are
victims of rape,

17:32.785 --> 17:36.256
and the first thing I tell them
is, "Don't blame yourself."

17:36.289 --> 17:38.358
Well, that's a lot easier said
than done.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.293
- You didn't answer
her question.

17:40.327 --> 17:42.295
- I'm sorry.
What question was that?

17:43.496 --> 17:47.134
- Okay. Dr. Keller,
the night of the shooting,

17:47.167 --> 17:49.602
you were upstairs here
in your bedroom,

17:49.636 --> 17:51.104
in your nightgown.

17:51.138 --> 17:53.106
Trey was downstairs
in the family room,

17:53.140 --> 17:54.274
and nobody else was
in the house?

17:54.307 --> 17:55.775
- That's correct.

17:55.808 --> 17:58.178
- And he didn't try and sneak
up here into your room?

17:59.412 --> 18:01.381
- I'm sorry, lieutenant.
I think it's best

18:01.414 --> 18:03.383
if you and your colleague here
leave.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.385
I'm sensing some
underlying hostility,

18:05.418 --> 18:07.520
and it's making me
very uncomfortable.

18:07.554 --> 18:11.258
- Yeah? And the naked selfies
of you and Trey

18:11.291 --> 18:13.360
are making me
very uncomfortable.

18:16.163 --> 18:19.132
[tense music]

18:19.166 --> 18:23.503
*

18:23.536 --> 18:25.138
- Trey was cool.

18:25.172 --> 18:26.506
He was only here
since September,

18:26.539 --> 18:28.341
but we were friends.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.277
- Were you friends
with Luke Keller, too?

18:30.310 --> 18:33.613
- Yeah. Luke and I have known
each other since kindergarten.

18:33.646 --> 18:37.150
He's a good guy.
A little--

18:37.184 --> 18:38.651
- You can say it.
He's a bit of a nerd.

18:38.685 --> 18:40.620
- Yeah. But he's okay.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.622
- But Luke and Trey were close?

18:42.655 --> 18:44.291
- Yeah. Tight.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.159
Trey kind of looked out
for him.

18:46.193 --> 18:47.394
- And Luke liked Trey?

18:47.427 --> 18:49.596
- He idolized Trey.
- Hm.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.332
- Thought he was a god.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.567
I don't know--it's sort of
crazy, if you think about it,

18:54.601 --> 18:58.638
that Luke ended up killing
his god.

18:58.671 --> 19:01.208
- Thank you, Ethan.
- Yeah.

19:03.276 --> 19:07.614
- I never heard rumors
about Trey and Luke's mother.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.383
Is that really
what you think happened?

19:10.417 --> 19:11.918
- We're not thinking
anything yet.

19:11.951 --> 19:15.622
- Right.
Well, the answer is no.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.457
I never heard anyone suggest

19:17.490 --> 19:19.926
that Trey and Dr. Keller were--

19:19.959 --> 19:22.862
- Okay. Anything else about Trey
you can tell us?

19:22.895 --> 19:25.598
- No. He's a good kid.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.234
For the most part.

19:27.267 --> 19:30.703
- For the most part?
What do you mean by that?

19:32.339 --> 19:34.407
- My son has already told
the police everything he knows.

19:34.441 --> 19:36.609
- Okay, well, we just need
to follow up on a few things

19:36.643 --> 19:38.678
about his relationship
with Trey Franklin.

19:38.711 --> 19:41.914
- Now, Ethan, you told me
that Trey was cool.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.450
Here, have a seat.

19:43.483 --> 19:46.253
- That's right.
- So, there's been no issues

19:46.286 --> 19:48.621
or problems
between the two of you?

19:48.655 --> 19:50.357
- None.
- None?

19:50.390 --> 19:52.459
Okay, well, here's the thing,
Ethan.

19:52.492 --> 19:55.262
We just found out
that you and Trey got suspended

19:55.295 --> 19:57.497
for getting into a fight
a week ago.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.966
- Wait. What's going on here?

19:59.999 --> 20:03.370
- Lying to the police
in a homicide investigation

20:03.403 --> 20:05.372
is a very serious matter.

20:05.405 --> 20:06.306
- Serious enough to derail

20:06.339 --> 20:07.740
that lacrosse scholarship
I heard about.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.942
- Okay, okay. Just--

20:11.678 --> 20:13.446
Tell them what happened.

20:16.983 --> 20:18.718
- Can you leave?

20:20.453 --> 20:24.391
I don't want to talk about this
with you here.

20:24.424 --> 20:27.660
- No. I'm not going anywhere.

20:27.694 --> 20:31.598
- Okay. But what I did--

20:31.631 --> 20:33.733
the reason we fought--

20:36.769 --> 20:38.305
[sighs]

20:38.338 --> 20:39.472
I can't tell you.

20:39.506 --> 20:41.541
- Ethan.
- You don't understand.

20:41.574 --> 20:44.377
- Just tell the truth. Now.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.516
- Your father's right.

20:49.549 --> 20:52.685
Just tell us why you and Trey
got into a fight.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.994
- We need to talk to you
down at the station.

21:02.028 --> 21:04.497
- I already told you
everything I know.

21:04.531 --> 21:06.366
- Yeah? Well,
we talked to Ethan Miller.

21:06.399 --> 21:08.501
You know him, right?
- Sure. He's a friend of Luke's.

21:08.535 --> 21:11.304
- He said that you sexually
assaulted him

21:11.338 --> 21:12.605
10 times, maybe 11.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.441
- That's preposterous.

21:14.474 --> 21:15.775
- Then you moved onto Trey.

21:15.808 --> 21:18.711
Ethan got upset, punched him.

21:18.745 --> 21:21.581
They both got suspended
from school.

21:21.614 --> 21:25.718
- They're kids. They fantasize
about older women.

21:25.752 --> 21:27.654
It's a natural,
healthy fantasy.

21:27.687 --> 21:31.624
- Nope. There's nothing natural
or healthy about statutory rape.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.660
Let's go.
You're coming with us.

21:33.693 --> 21:36.363
*

21:43.102 --> 21:44.203
- Were you having a sexual
relationship with Trey Franklin

21:46.105 --> 21:49.041
prior to the night
he was shot and killed?

21:49.075 --> 21:51.010
- Like I've been trying
to tell you,

21:51.043 --> 21:52.845
he was obsessed with me.

21:52.879 --> 21:53.980
- That's a yes?

21:54.013 --> 21:56.783
- It's an absolute,
unequivocal no.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.351
- What about Ethan?
That's an absolute,

21:58.385 --> 22:00.086
unequivocal no, too?

22:00.119 --> 22:02.054
- Correct.

22:03.390 --> 22:05.091
- So, Ethan was lying?

22:05.124 --> 22:06.759
- Of course he's lying!

22:06.793 --> 22:09.362
- Okay. Well, when he told me
what happened,

22:09.396 --> 22:11.130
he started to cry.

22:11.163 --> 22:11.898
And then he turned
to his father,

22:11.931 --> 22:14.501
and he begged him
not to hate him.

22:16.403 --> 22:19.038
We have a believable
15-year-old boy in there

22:19.071 --> 22:22.909
who is claiming that you
sexually assaulted him

22:22.942 --> 22:24.377
and Trey Franklin.

22:24.411 --> 22:26.112
- Making things worse,
Trey is dead.

22:26.145 --> 22:29.115
- Because you told your son
that he was raping you,

22:29.148 --> 22:31.818
when, in fact,
you were raping him.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.120
- You're making this up.
- The sooner you tell us

22:34.153 --> 22:36.523
the truth, the better this is
gonna be for you.

22:38.458 --> 22:42.862
And more importantly, Luke.

22:42.895 --> 22:46.165
- Don't you presume to tell me
what's best for my son.

22:46.198 --> 22:49.469
- I'm not presuming anything.
I'm just stating facts.

22:49.502 --> 22:51.438
- [scoffs]
My understanding of the law is

22:51.471 --> 22:54.574
unless I'm under arrest,
I'm free to go.

22:56.543 --> 22:57.977
I'll be calling my lawyer.

22:58.010 --> 23:00.413
- That's your right.
We'll be in touch.

23:00.447 --> 23:02.415
I'm sure we'll have a lot
to talk about.

23:02.449 --> 23:05.418
[dramatic music]

23:05.452 --> 23:10.623
*

23:10.657 --> 23:12.425
- She's a stone-cold liar.

23:12.459 --> 23:14.427
- A psychiatrist...

23:14.461 --> 23:16.162
who's abusing teenage boys,

23:16.195 --> 23:20.066
emotionally damaging
her own son.

23:20.099 --> 23:24.203
That is deeper than lying, man.
That is pathological.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.572
- And we just let her
walk out of here?

23:25.605 --> 23:28.107
- Look. I want to track
her phone.

23:28.140 --> 23:29.976
I need to vet Ethan's story.

23:30.009 --> 23:33.179
- She's smart. And a liar like
that--she covers her tracks.

23:33.212 --> 23:34.914
- That's why we need
hard evidence

23:34.947 --> 23:36.182
that she cannot lie
her way out of.

23:36.215 --> 23:38.885
But first we need
to make absolutely sure

23:38.918 --> 23:40.119
that Luke had no prior knowledge

23:40.152 --> 23:43.456
of what was going on
with his mother and Trey.

23:45.091 --> 23:48.661
- That's crazy.
No way would my mom and Ethan--

23:48.695 --> 23:50.497
he's a liar--he's lying.

23:50.530 --> 23:52.031
- Listen.
I know this is hard to hear--

23:52.064 --> 23:53.132
- Because it's not true.

23:53.165 --> 23:55.067
My mom told me
you were gonna say this.

23:55.101 --> 23:56.969
- Just listen to what they say,
Luke.

23:57.003 --> 23:59.238
- I'm sorry
to have to tell you this.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.708
But it's not just Ethan.
We also believe

24:01.741 --> 24:02.642
Trey and your mom were having--

24:02.675 --> 24:05.211
- She said you were gonna
say that, too!

24:05.244 --> 24:08.981
There's no way that--that--

24:11.250 --> 24:13.185
It's just not true.

24:15.555 --> 24:18.224
My mom would never do that.

24:18.257 --> 24:19.626
- Okay.

24:23.162 --> 24:26.165
I think Luke is being
completely honest.

24:26.198 --> 24:29.168
- Well, of course he is.
He's a good kid.

24:29.201 --> 24:30.537
His mother,
on the other hand, is--

24:30.570 --> 24:31.971
- Is what?

24:32.004 --> 24:33.940
- Complicated.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.608
- Dr. Keller,
is there anything

24:35.642 --> 24:38.177
in Nicole's past
or your relationship

24:38.210 --> 24:43.015
that might help explain this--
this type of behavior?

24:43.049 --> 24:45.184
- She is a malignant narcissist,

24:45.217 --> 24:47.520
probably borderline.

24:48.254 --> 24:50.222
I'm a psychiatrist as well.

24:51.323 --> 24:54.193
- So, this lying, manipulating,

24:54.226 --> 24:56.162
abusive pattern of behavior's

24:56.195 --> 24:57.296
been going on for a long time?

24:57.329 --> 24:59.932
- Since the day I met her.

24:59.966 --> 25:02.735
Nicole is like the best
and worst woman you've ever met

25:02.769 --> 25:04.003
wrapped in one.

25:04.036 --> 25:05.538
- Yeah, we've been getting that.

25:05.572 --> 25:07.540
- Well, when we first met,
she's--she's charming.

25:07.574 --> 25:09.075
She's brilliant.

25:09.108 --> 25:12.278
But gradually, her sickness
began to reveal itself.

25:12.311 --> 25:14.581
- How do you mean?

25:14.614 --> 25:15.948
- [sighs]

25:15.982 --> 25:18.284
Look, with Nicole--

25:18.317 --> 25:20.219
this woman truly believes
that she's special,

25:20.252 --> 25:23.690
that she deserves this unique
and constant admiration.

25:25.157 --> 25:28.561
She lacks compassion, empathy.

25:28.595 --> 25:32.599
Yet, at the same time,
she is remarkably fragile.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.768
She has no true sense of self,

25:35.802 --> 25:37.570
and I--I just--
I couldn't take it.

25:37.604 --> 25:40.239
- So you left her.
- Yes.

25:40.272 --> 25:41.974
Yes. Look, but I tried
to make it work.

25:42.008 --> 25:43.576
I-I couldn't.

25:43.610 --> 25:47.346
- You just let Luke stay there,
live with her,

25:47.379 --> 25:49.582
knowing Nicole has
all these issues?

25:49.616 --> 25:51.718
- No. I fought like hell
for custody,

25:51.751 --> 25:53.352
but the judge sided with her,
because, I'm telling you,

25:53.385 --> 25:57.556
this woman--she is incredibly
charming and persuasive.

26:04.030 --> 26:06.132
I never thought
she'd destroy her own son.

26:10.236 --> 26:12.138
Just tell me you're not gonna
charge Luke with a crime.

26:12.171 --> 26:14.106
- Your ex-wife is
the criminal here.

26:14.140 --> 26:15.675
We're gonna speak with the ADA.

26:15.708 --> 26:20.079
*

26:20.112 --> 26:22.682
I don't think that Luke
intentionally shot Trey.

26:22.715 --> 26:25.284
He truly believes that his
mother was being assaulted.

26:25.317 --> 26:26.585
- I agree.
Council, look.

26:26.619 --> 26:29.756
Luke had no clue that his mother
was using his friends sexually.

26:29.789 --> 26:31.323
He just happened to walk in.
I mean, if he hadn't

26:31.357 --> 26:33.192
gotten into an argument
with his father that night,

26:33.225 --> 26:35.094
he never would've been there
in the first place.

26:35.127 --> 26:37.163
Nicole is the one who's lying,
not Luke.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.765
- And this proves it.

26:38.798 --> 26:41.768
Lab results are back.
Traces of fresh semen were found

26:41.801 --> 26:43.836
on a towel in Nicole's bedroom
upstairs.

26:43.870 --> 26:44.771
DNA matches Trey's.

26:44.804 --> 26:46.773
- She said Trey was upstairs
that night?

26:46.806 --> 26:49.408
- We asked her point blank,
and she denied it.

26:49.441 --> 26:52.879
- Arrest her.
- Statutory rape?

26:52.912 --> 26:54.847
- Oh, I'm thinking a lot more
than that.

26:58.184 --> 27:00.419
- Let's talk about that.
- Okay, time's up.

27:00.452 --> 27:01.754
- What?
- I'm sorry, sir.

27:01.788 --> 27:03.189
NYPD. We're gonna need the room.

27:03.222 --> 27:04.056
- Are you kidding me?
- Nope.

27:04.090 --> 27:06.625
- Look,
just get out of here, man. Go.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.329
- First, you lie to my son.

27:10.362 --> 27:12.331
Now you harass me
in my place of business?

27:12.364 --> 27:14.200
- Stop talking.
You're under arrest.

27:14.233 --> 27:15.334
- On what charges?

27:15.367 --> 27:17.269
- Third degree rape
of a minor.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.672
- I'm the victim here.
- And murder.

27:19.706 --> 27:22.208
- Murder?
I didn't murder anyone.

27:22.241 --> 27:24.443
- Look, lady. Turn around.
Come on.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.178
- Get her out of here.

27:27.179 --> 27:29.148
[handcuffs clicking]

27:35.121 --> 27:36.055
[overlapping shouts]
- Okay, look, look, look.

27:36.956 --> 27:38.124
Our only goal was
to follow the evidence

27:38.157 --> 27:40.159
and bring the person responsible
for Trey Franklin's death

27:40.192 --> 27:43.863
to justice, and that person is
Nicole Keller.

27:43.896 --> 27:45.197
To cry rape while she herself

27:45.231 --> 27:46.899
was sexually assaulting
a teenage boy

27:46.933 --> 27:49.001
with her son ten feet away,
holding a rifle,

27:49.035 --> 27:51.403
shows such depraved indifference
to Trey Franklin's life

27:51.437 --> 27:54.874
that the DA's office feels
compelled to punish this woman

27:54.907 --> 27:56.075
to the fullest extent
of the law.

27:56.108 --> 27:57.744
Thank you.

27:57.777 --> 28:01.147
- We applaud Mr. Barba's courage
in taking on this case.

28:01.180 --> 28:04.717
Our 15-year-old son, Trey,
was abused by a manipulative

28:04.751 --> 28:07.019
and remorseless 45-year-old
psychiatrist.

28:07.053 --> 28:09.155
Because of her, he's dead.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.424
Let's go.

28:12.458 --> 28:15.427
- Last Tuesday night,
Dr. Nicole Keller

28:15.461 --> 28:17.964
was the victim
of a sexual assault,

28:17.997 --> 28:19.899
and if it weren't for
the actions of her son, Luke,

28:19.932 --> 28:21.801
she might have been killed.

28:21.834 --> 28:24.503
Dr. Keller is a respected
and empathetic psychiatrist

28:24.536 --> 28:26.906
who was simply trying
to help Trey Franklin,

28:26.939 --> 28:29.075
and despite the fact
that he sexually assaulted her,

28:29.108 --> 28:32.211
she is devastated
by his tragic death.

28:32.244 --> 28:35.047
And to suggest that she had
anything to do with this

28:35.081 --> 28:37.917
is absolutely outrageous.

28:37.950 --> 28:40.052
[reporters all speaking at once]

28:42.188 --> 28:44.156
- Lieutenant Benson, this towel,
marked exhibit D,

28:44.190 --> 28:45.992
was taken from the home
of the defendant.

28:46.025 --> 28:47.927
Are you familiar with this item?
- Yes.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.196
- Can you tell us which part
of the house it was taken from?

28:50.229 --> 28:52.131
- The master bedroom.
- Where is that located?

28:52.164 --> 28:53.966
- On the top floor
of the brownstone.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.468
- Did you receive a report from
the crime lab about this towel?

28:56.502 --> 29:00.006
- Yes. Trace evidence of fresh
semen was found on the towel.

29:00.039 --> 29:02.241
The DNA was a match
to Trey Franklin.

29:02.274 --> 29:04.543
- When you questioned
the defendant

29:04.576 --> 29:05.978
in the aftermath
of the shooting,

29:06.012 --> 29:07.814
did she mention
that Trey had been

29:07.847 --> 29:08.948
in the top floor
of the brownstone?

29:08.981 --> 29:11.117
- No. She specifically stated

29:11.150 --> 29:13.285
that he was downstairs
the entire time,

29:13.319 --> 29:15.922
and then, in a subsequent
interview, restated it.

29:15.955 --> 29:17.790
- Thank you. Nothing further.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.060
- No questions, Your Honor.

29:24.864 --> 29:27.066
- Prosecution calls Luke Keller.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.068
When you walked
into the downstairs kitchen,

29:29.101 --> 29:30.069
what did you see?

29:30.102 --> 29:31.938
- My mother bent over

29:31.971 --> 29:35.007
with a man behind her,
on top of her.

29:35.041 --> 29:36.575
- Did you know it was Trey?

29:36.608 --> 29:39.111
- No!
- Then what happened?

29:42.882 --> 29:44.516
- My mother looked at me
and screamed,

29:44.550 --> 29:46.118
"Help! He's raping me."

29:46.152 --> 29:47.586
- Did she make eye contact
with you?

29:47.619 --> 29:49.088
- Yes.
- Did she see the rifle?

29:49.121 --> 29:51.357
- Objection. Speculation.

29:51.390 --> 29:52.992
- Sustained.
- Rephrase:

29:53.025 --> 29:54.927
did she ever look down
at your hands?

29:54.961 --> 29:56.262
- Yes.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.235
I think so.

30:03.269 --> 30:05.004
- After your mother looked down
at your hands and yelled,

30:05.037 --> 30:07.173
"Help! He's raping me,"
what did you do?

30:09.008 --> 30:10.242
- I pulled the trigger.

30:10.276 --> 30:12.879
But I was just trying
to scare him away.

30:12.912 --> 30:15.347
I just wanted to save my mom
from what was happening.

30:16.883 --> 30:18.150
- Nothing further.

30:19.986 --> 30:23.089
- That must have been traumatic,

30:23.122 --> 30:25.391
walking in on your mother
like that.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.259
- Yes.
- And you're young.

30:27.293 --> 30:29.061
You don't know a lot about sex.

30:29.095 --> 30:33.232
Must have looked to you
like she was very frightened.

30:33.265 --> 30:34.867
Right?

30:34.901 --> 30:37.269
- Yeah. I mean, it looked bad.

30:37.303 --> 30:41.573
- So, when she yelled,
"Help! He's raping me,"

30:41.607 --> 30:42.942
you believed her.

30:42.975 --> 30:45.144
- Yes. At the time.

30:45.177 --> 30:48.247
But Lieutenant Benson told me
about what they found.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.917
- Yes, but at the time,
in your mind,

30:50.950 --> 30:53.052
Trey was sexually assaulting
your mother?

30:53.085 --> 30:55.221
- Yes, but it was all happening
so fast.

30:55.254 --> 30:57.123
I--I just reacted.

30:57.156 --> 31:00.226
- Right. You reacted
to what you saw:

31:00.259 --> 31:03.329
a man attacking your mother.

31:03.362 --> 31:08.067
As for the rifle, you have
no idea if your mother saw it.

31:08.100 --> 31:10.369
I mean, you have no way
of knowing

31:10.402 --> 31:14.306
what her eyes were
actually focused on.

31:14.340 --> 31:15.975
- Yeah. I--I guess.

31:16.008 --> 31:17.944
- Especially
since she was being raped.

31:17.977 --> 31:22.081
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

31:22.114 --> 31:24.250
One other thing, Luke.

31:27.453 --> 31:31.223
The prosecutor, Mr. Barba,

31:31.257 --> 31:33.225
made a deal with you

31:33.259 --> 31:34.660
including no jail time

31:34.693 --> 31:37.129
for testifying
against your mother...

31:39.999 --> 31:42.234
Even though you're the one

31:42.268 --> 31:45.271
who killed Trey Franklin,
correct?

31:47.706 --> 31:50.176
- Yes.

31:50.209 --> 31:52.244
- Nothing further.

31:56.315 --> 31:58.250
- You may step down.

32:10.029 --> 32:11.163
- It's okay.

32:11.197 --> 32:13.032
It's okay.

32:13.065 --> 32:14.433
Come on.
Let's get you out of here.

32:14.466 --> 32:21.507
*

32:23.009 --> 32:26.412
- I tried my best,
but this is all my fault.

32:26.445 --> 32:28.247
I didn't have
to pull the trigger.

32:28.280 --> 32:32.051
- It took a lot of courage
to get up on that stand.

32:32.084 --> 32:33.219
- Come on, Luke. Let's go.

32:33.252 --> 32:35.287
- I'll walk you out.

32:37.289 --> 32:40.059
- Luke. Luke.
- Mom.

32:43.295 --> 32:50.336
*

32:56.308 --> 32:59.411
- Poor kid doesn't know
whether to hate her or love her.

32:59.445 --> 33:02.414
- It's hard to give up
on your mother,

33:02.448 --> 33:04.316
no matter how sick she may be.

33:06.518 --> 33:08.454
- So, what happened?

33:08.487 --> 33:11.223
- I was in the kitchen,
pouring a glass of wine.

33:11.257 --> 33:13.225
Then I saw Trey walking
toward me.

33:13.259 --> 33:18.164
He grabbed me and kissed me,
hard, aggressive.

33:18.197 --> 33:21.267
I told him to stop,
but he pulled up my nightgown

33:21.300 --> 33:24.470
and put his penis inside me.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.572
- Then what happened?
- I started to scream.

33:26.605 --> 33:29.775
He put his hand over my mouth,
told me to shut up

33:29.808 --> 33:31.543
or he'd kill me.

33:31.577 --> 33:34.346
A few minutes later, I saw Luke.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.048
- What did you say to him?

33:36.082 --> 33:38.284
- Well, I screamed, "Help!"

33:38.317 --> 33:40.219
I screamed, "I'm being raped!"

33:40.252 --> 33:42.588
- Did you know he had a gun
in his hand?

33:42.621 --> 33:45.324
- No. I was in shock.

33:45.357 --> 33:46.525
I was being attacked.

33:46.558 --> 33:49.228
- What happened
after you yelled "rape"?

33:49.261 --> 33:51.230
- I heard a loud,

33:51.263 --> 33:54.800
horrible gunshot,

33:54.833 --> 33:57.069
and then it was over.

33:59.305 --> 34:01.340
- Nothing further.

34:03.275 --> 34:06.312
- Trey showed up at your house
at 9:00 at night.

34:06.345 --> 34:08.380
Your son wasn't home,
but you let him in anyway?

34:08.414 --> 34:11.283
- I felt empathy
for his turbulent home life.

34:11.317 --> 34:14.153
- You kept telling the police
that--"his turbulent home life,"

34:14.186 --> 34:15.854
even though his parents are
happily married

34:15.887 --> 34:16.822
and he's a straight-A student.

34:16.855 --> 34:19.358
- Grades are not indicative
of psychological

34:19.391 --> 34:20.559
or emotional problems.

34:20.592 --> 34:22.394
- We're not interested in your
psycho-babble for the moment,

34:22.428 --> 34:23.429
but thank you so much
for sharing.

34:23.462 --> 34:25.131
Um, you also told the police

34:25.164 --> 34:27.633
that Trey stayed downstairs
all night,

34:27.666 --> 34:32.504
and yet his semen was found
on a towel in your bedroom,

34:32.538 --> 34:34.406
on the top floor
of your brownstone.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.142
- Is there a question here,
Your Honor?

34:36.175 --> 34:38.110
- Yes. How did it get there?

34:38.144 --> 34:40.812
- I have no idea.
Maybe he snuck up to my room

34:40.846 --> 34:42.581
and masturbated that night.

34:42.614 --> 34:45.551
- Or maybe you had an initial
sexual encounter with Trey

34:45.584 --> 34:47.419
in your room, then brought him
down to the kitchen

34:47.453 --> 34:48.854
to have more sex.
- Objection.

34:48.887 --> 34:50.356
- I'll allow.

34:50.389 --> 34:51.323
- That's not what happened.

34:51.357 --> 34:52.558
- That's exactly what happened.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.326
You let him into your home
late at night

34:54.360 --> 34:56.428
while wearing lingerie.

34:56.462 --> 34:58.197
- It was a nightgown.
- We're not gonna argue

34:58.230 --> 35:00.232
about semantics.

35:00.266 --> 35:01.633
This is what you were wearing.

35:01.667 --> 35:03.335
- Yes. But I was ready for bed.

35:03.369 --> 35:05.404
- Or maybe you were ready
to sexually assault

35:05.437 --> 35:06.572
a 15-year-old boy.

35:08.274 --> 35:11.910
You let him into your house
while wearing only a nightgown.

35:11.943 --> 35:14.313
An hour later,
your son interrupted

35:14.346 --> 35:15.547
you and Trey in the kitchen.

35:15.581 --> 35:19.285
Even though you saw a rifle
in his hand, you cried "rape"

35:19.318 --> 35:21.353
to cover up the fact that you
were abusing his friend.

35:21.387 --> 35:23.855
- Trey raped me.
- No. You raped him.

35:23.889 --> 35:26.124
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

35:28.427 --> 35:35.467
*

35:37.303 --> 35:40.539
- Your Honor,
I'd like to testify again.

35:42.441 --> 35:44.276
I need to change my defense.

35:44.310 --> 35:46.345
- What?

35:48.314 --> 35:50.482
- I've been lying.

35:50.516 --> 35:52.484
I just want to tell the truth.

35:52.518 --> 35:55.454
The real truth.

35:55.487 --> 35:58.390
- Uh, Your Honor, we should
discuss this matter in private.

35:58.424 --> 35:59.725
- Agreed.

36:10.702 --> 36:10.836
.

36:10.869 --> 36:11.737
- She's had a change of heart,
Your Honor.

36:12.338 --> 36:14.240
She wants to tell the truth.

36:14.273 --> 36:15.574
- What the hell
does that even mean?

36:15.607 --> 36:16.742
You don't get
to suddenly tell the truth

36:16.775 --> 36:18.577
because the jury isn't
buying your lies.

36:18.610 --> 36:21.380
- I have the right to redirect
the testimony of my witness,

36:21.413 --> 36:23.382
and in the course
of that redirection,

36:23.415 --> 36:25.517
my client will offer
a new defense.

36:25.551 --> 36:27.486
- What are you talking about,
Mr. Buchanan?

36:27.519 --> 36:30.522
- Dr. Keller's new testimony
will contradict

36:30.556 --> 36:32.258
her prior testimony.

36:32.291 --> 36:34.626
- So, she's willing to admit
to the jury, to the judge,

36:34.660 --> 36:36.295
that she perjured herself?

36:36.328 --> 36:38.497
- She is. She just wants
to clear her conscience,

36:38.530 --> 36:40.666
and let the chips fall
where they may.

36:40.699 --> 36:43.802
- I agree in concept,
but first I'd like to know

36:43.835 --> 36:45.737
what this new defense is.

36:49.308 --> 36:51.810
- Tell the jury
exactly what happened.

36:54.613 --> 36:59.585
- Trey Franklin and I were
in the kitchen having sex.

37:00.786 --> 37:02.854
Then Luke walked in on us

37:02.888 --> 37:04.656
and shot his friend in the head.

37:04.690 --> 37:08.660
- So, you didn't yell,
"Help! He's raping me"?

37:08.694 --> 37:11.697
- No.
- Did you make eye contact

37:11.730 --> 37:13.832
with Luke prior to him
pulling the trigger?

37:13.865 --> 37:17.503
- No, I did not.

37:17.536 --> 37:20.339
- Then what happened?

37:20.372 --> 37:22.808
- What happened was
I realized

37:22.841 --> 37:26.412
I didn't want my son
to go to prison,

37:26.445 --> 37:30.716
so I told the police
that Trey had raped me,

37:30.749 --> 37:34.520
and Luke killed him
to protect me.

37:34.553 --> 37:35.587
- Oh, my God.

37:35.621 --> 37:37.889
- But that was a lie?
- Yes.

37:37.923 --> 37:40.626
- And Luke knew
that you and Trey were involved

37:40.659 --> 37:43.862
in a sexual relationship?
- Yes.

37:43.895 --> 37:45.664
- How?

37:48.667 --> 37:51.937
- One time, I saw him
watching us having sex.

37:51.970 --> 37:53.905
- Okay, that's enough, honey.
We're gonna go. Let's go.

37:53.939 --> 37:55.607
- No. I want to hear.

37:56.642 --> 37:59.445
- What was your son doing?

38:01.747 --> 38:05.717
- He was--he was in the doorway,
masturbating.

38:05.751 --> 38:07.353
[gasps and murmuring]

38:07.386 --> 38:08.454
- You don't need to hear this,
sweetheart.

38:08.487 --> 38:10.422
- Dr. Keller, are you saying

38:10.456 --> 38:12.958
your son has a romantic
attraction for you?

38:12.991 --> 38:14.660
- Yes.

38:14.693 --> 38:16.762
It's not as unusual
as you might think.

38:16.795 --> 38:18.597
- Yes, that's enough, honey.
I'm taking you out.

38:18.630 --> 38:19.731
Right now. Let's go.

38:19.765 --> 38:21.933
- Luke, it's my fault.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.735
I should've taken better care
of you.

38:23.769 --> 38:25.737
I should never have
gotten involved with Trey.

38:25.771 --> 38:28.607
I take full responsibility
for this.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.776
- Come on, honey.
- Even though my son shot

38:30.809 --> 38:32.744
and killed Trey.
- Luke, enough.

38:32.778 --> 38:33.779
- Objection, Your Honor.

38:33.812 --> 38:36.382
- Sustained. Mr. Buchanan,
any more questions?

38:36.415 --> 38:38.450
- Um, nothing else,
Your Honor.

38:38.484 --> 38:39.751
- We are adjourned.
- Your Honor, I want

38:39.785 --> 38:41.353
to cross-examine
this defendant now,

38:41.387 --> 38:42.554
today, while the jury is still--

38:42.588 --> 38:43.489
- That's enough for today.

38:43.522 --> 38:46.658
We will resume tomorrow morning
at 9:00 a.m.

38:46.692 --> 38:51.930
*

38:51.963 --> 38:54.666
- She's burying her own son
to create reasonable doubt.

38:54.700 --> 38:56.735
- Yeah, and she just might
get away with it.

38:56.768 --> 38:58.003
The jury's got to see
what she's doing,

38:58.036 --> 38:59.571
hate her as much as we do.

38:59.605 --> 39:01.507
- Maybe.
But a few skeptical jurors,

39:01.540 --> 39:02.808
and she walks
on a murder charge.

39:04.042 --> 39:06.378
- Excuse me, Mr. Barba?

39:06.412 --> 39:08.647
- Oh, it's all right.
Show him in.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.516
- I'm sorry to come down here.
I didn't know where else to go.

39:10.549 --> 39:12.484
- What is it?
- Luke wants to plead guilty.

39:12.518 --> 39:14.886
- Guilty? Guilty of what?
- Murder.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.788
But he can't even do that,
right? You gave him immunity.

39:16.822 --> 39:18.557
- Qualified immunity.

39:18.590 --> 39:20.559
- Listen,
if he changes his story now,

39:20.592 --> 39:21.660
he starts lying
to protect his mother,

39:21.693 --> 39:22.894
that deal--
that goes away.

39:22.928 --> 39:24.896
- The judge may very well
accept his plea.

39:24.930 --> 39:26.665
- Dr. Keller,
this makes no sense.

39:26.698 --> 39:28.467
What exactly is Luke saying?

39:28.500 --> 39:31.903
- He now believes
he deliberately shot Trey,

39:31.937 --> 39:35.674
that deep down he knew his
mother was screwing his friend.

39:35.707 --> 39:36.975
- She's spinning him
upside down.

39:37.008 --> 39:38.710
- She wants him to go to prison?

39:38.744 --> 39:41.680
- In her deluded mind, Luke is
responsible for what happened,

39:41.713 --> 39:43.014
for her shame.

39:43.048 --> 39:45.016
He is the enemy,

39:45.050 --> 39:46.785
so taking him down--

39:46.818 --> 39:48.620
that's gonna make her
feel whole again.

39:48.654 --> 39:50.889
- Even if it means convincing
her son he's responsible

39:50.922 --> 39:52.023
for a murder he didn't commit?

39:52.057 --> 39:53.559
- Well,
we can't let her do that,

39:53.592 --> 39:54.793
so, Mr. Keller,

39:54.826 --> 39:55.994
where is Luke now?

39:56.027 --> 39:57.796
I'd like to talk to him.

39:59.931 --> 40:02.568
Hi, Luke.
Thanks for meeting me.

40:02.601 --> 40:04.870
- My dad said I had to.

40:06.004 --> 40:07.806
- You hanging in there?

40:10.008 --> 40:12.578
How about maybe we could
take a drive?

40:12.611 --> 40:14.846
- Yeah.
- Okay.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.482
My car's right there.

40:24.890 --> 40:26.758
How about we go
get something to eat?

40:26.792 --> 40:29.461
- Actually, I'm not hungry.

40:29.495 --> 40:31.730
And I don't want people
staring at me.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.832
- We can talk here,
if that's okay.

40:33.865 --> 40:35.734
- Sure.

40:35.767 --> 40:37.869
- Okay.

40:37.903 --> 40:40.806
[takes deep breath]

40:40.839 --> 40:45.777
So, Luke, I know that you want
to help your mother,

40:45.811 --> 40:47.779
but you can't plead guilty.

40:47.813 --> 40:49.681
- Why?

40:49.715 --> 40:50.916
I'm the one who shot Trey.

40:50.949 --> 40:53.752
- Because she begged
for your help.

40:53.785 --> 40:56.021
You told that to me
and Detective Carisi

40:56.054 --> 40:57.823
a dozen times, Luke.

40:57.856 --> 41:00.759
You were trying
to save her life.

41:00.792 --> 41:04.763
- Yeah, I know,
but I knew she liked Trey,

41:04.796 --> 41:07.499
and she was always real
talkative when he was around.

41:07.533 --> 41:09.668
- Did you ever see
the two of them together,

41:09.701 --> 41:10.802
physically?

41:10.836 --> 41:13.004
- No.
- Okay.

41:23.749 --> 41:25.917
- What my mother said about me--

41:25.951 --> 41:28.954
you know, watching--
that's a lie.

41:28.987 --> 41:30.656
- I know that.

41:30.689 --> 41:32.958
- But I did hear her say that
Trey was really handsome once,

41:32.991 --> 41:34.693
so maybe I did know,

41:34.726 --> 41:36.595
and I just didn't know
that I knew.

41:36.628 --> 41:38.530
- Luke, listen to me:

41:38.564 --> 41:40.932
what your mother did to Trey

41:40.966 --> 41:43.602
and what she did to Ethan--

41:43.635 --> 41:46.137
that's a crime.

41:46.171 --> 41:48.574
It's called statutory rape.

41:52.844 --> 41:54.780
- I was trying to save her.

41:54.813 --> 41:56.782
- I know that.

41:56.815 --> 41:58.950
You are a good son.

41:58.984 --> 42:02.821
And you are a very brave person.

42:02.854 --> 42:04.956
- I shot Trey.

42:04.990 --> 42:06.758
That makes me a killer.

42:06.792 --> 42:07.959
- Look at me.

42:07.993 --> 42:10.962
You didn't intend to kill Trey.

42:10.996 --> 42:14.800
You know that.
I know that.

42:14.833 --> 42:17.068
And your mother knows that.

42:21.707 --> 42:24.743
Your mother told me
the hunting story.

42:24.776 --> 42:30.081
That--that you had a deer
right in your sights,

42:30.115 --> 42:32.851
and you couldn't
pull the trigger,

42:32.884 --> 42:36.722
because you couldn't kill
a living, breathing animal.

42:36.755 --> 42:38.757
That's who you are.

42:41.026 --> 42:46.164
And it's not your job
to sacrifice your life for hers.

42:52.003 --> 42:58.009
*

42:58.043 --> 42:59.878
- Mr. Barba,
are you ready to begin

42:59.911 --> 43:02.914
your cross-examination
of the defendant?

43:02.948 --> 43:05.617
- No, Your Honor.

43:05.651 --> 43:07.719
I'd like to recall a witness:

43:07.753 --> 43:08.920
Luke Keller.

43:27.739 --> 43:31.910
Luke, did you intentionally
shoot Trey Franklin

43:31.943 --> 43:33.044
because you were angry at him

43:33.078 --> 43:34.780
for being
in a sexual relationship

43:34.813 --> 43:36.848
with your mother?

43:49.961 --> 43:52.798
- No.

43:52.831 --> 43:55.801
That's not true.

43:55.834 --> 43:59.304
I shot him because I thought
he was raping her.

43:59.337 --> 44:01.707
- And why did you think that?

44:02.841 --> 44:05.210
- Because she looked me
in the eye and yelled,

44:05.243 --> 44:07.813
"Help. He's raping me."

44:10.949 --> 44:17.723
*

44:17.756 --> 44:19.791
- Members of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

44:19.825 --> 44:21.159
- We have, Your Honor.

44:21.192 --> 44:23.094
- What say you?

44:23.128 --> 44:25.030
- On the charge
of second degree murder,

44:25.063 --> 44:28.166
we find the defendant guilty.

44:28.199 --> 44:32.037
On the charge of third degree
rape of a minor,

44:32.070 --> 44:35.173
we find the defendant guilty.

44:35.206 --> 44:37.843
- The state of New York
thanks you for your service.

44:37.876 --> 44:38.944
Court is adjourned.

44:38.977 --> 44:41.279
- Luke! I love you.
- Nicole, no.

44:41.312 --> 44:43.949
- And I forgive you!

44:43.982 --> 44:46.985
I do! Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?

44:47.018 --> 44:49.988
I'm still your mother!

44:50.021 --> 44:53.825
I'll always be your mother,
no matter what you've done!

44:53.859 --> 44:56.995
I will always be your mother!

44:57.028 --> 44:59.931
- Let's go.
- Congratulations, Lieutenant.

44:59.965 --> 45:01.299
You've convinced my son
I'm the devil.

45:01.332 --> 45:03.368
- No, Nicole.

45:03.401 --> 45:05.370
You did that all by yourself.

45:15.146 --> 45:16.915
- You okay?

45:18.249 --> 45:20.251
Look.

45:20.285 --> 45:23.088
He's a strong kid.
He'll be fine.

45:23.121 --> 45:25.991
- You really believe that?

45:26.024 --> 45:27.192
- [sighs]

45:27.225 --> 45:29.160
Can I buy you a drink?

45:30.829 --> 45:33.899
- No, thanks.
I got to go home to see Noah.

45:33.932 --> 45:35.767
I got to--

45:35.801 --> 45:37.936
I just want to be with my boy.

46:01.126 --> 46:01.259
.

46:01.292 --> 46:01.726
[dramatic music]

46:04.095 --> 46:11.102
