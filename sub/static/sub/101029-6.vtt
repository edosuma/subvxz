In other news, the automatic recount

00:08.174 --> 00:10.677
in the 27th State Senate District election

00:10.760 --> 00:12.095
is in its third day

00:12.178 --> 00:14.931
and is set to release
its final tally results this morning.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.433
The automatic recount was triggered

00:16.516 --> 00:18.560
by a final vote count on Election Day

00:18.643 --> 00:20.937
that had
Senate Majority Leader Dede Standish

00:21.021 --> 00:24.024
leading upstart environmental candidate
Payton Hobart

00:24.107 --> 00:25.483
by only 23 votes,

00:25.567 --> 00:26.776
well within the margin

00:26.860 --> 00:29.320
that triggers a hand count
under New York State law.

00:29.404 --> 00:31.281
Statements from both the Standish

00:31.364 --> 00:32.741
and Hobart campaigns

00:32.824 --> 00:35.785
insist that their candidates
will emerge the victor.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.495
We turn now to Kyle Bernier,

00:37.579 --> 00:39.456
who is out front of Standish headquarters,

00:39.539 --> 00:41.291
where Payton Hobart is expected to meet

00:41.374 --> 00:44.335
with Dede Standish
and election board officials any moment.

00:46.755 --> 00:47.714
It's a tie.

00:47.797 --> 00:50.258
-[Payton] No fucking way!
-[Dede] You have got to be kidding!

00:50.341 --> 00:51.509
I am not kidding.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.928
The New York State Elections Board
is not known

00:54.012 --> 00:55.388
for its collective sense of humor.

00:55.472 --> 00:57.807
We take our jobs very seriously.

00:57.891 --> 00:58.808
Very seriously.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.519
How is a tie even possible?

01:01.603 --> 01:03.521
Well, it happens
when the same number of voters

01:03.605 --> 01:06.983
-cast a ballot for each of you.
-I know! I am not a fucking imbecile.

01:07.067 --> 01:10.153
What she means is, she was up 23 votes.

01:10.528 --> 01:12.072
Where did those votes go?

01:12.155 --> 01:13.323
Clearly, they never existed.

01:13.406 --> 01:14.908
That tally was preliminary

01:14.991 --> 01:16.951
and obviously an overcount in your favor.

01:17.035 --> 01:19.537
It's quite common
for the initial count to not be...

01:19.829 --> 01:20.872
totally accurate.

01:20.955 --> 01:22.957
-So, count them again.
-[man 1] We did.

01:23.041 --> 01:26.461
Still tied: 45,626 votes apiece.

01:26.544 --> 01:28.213
Well, count them by hand!

01:28.296 --> 01:30.006
It was a hand recount.

01:30.090 --> 01:33.093
Two machine recounts and a hand recount,
all with the same result.

01:33.843 --> 01:37.472
The board of elections
has officially certified this is a tie.

01:37.555 --> 01:39.057
That decision is final.

01:39.140 --> 01:41.226
You know what?
You know who probably didn't even vote?

01:41.309 --> 01:43.853
James. I bet he stayed home out of spite.
Bet you a million bucks.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.647
-[chatter continues]
-I busted my fucking ass,

01:45.730 --> 01:48.233
and I am tied
with a fucking theater major?

01:48.316 --> 01:51.528
After six years of working together,
he couldn't have shown up on the one day?

01:51.611 --> 01:54.697
Who the fuck
with half a brain in their fucking head...

01:54.781 --> 01:56.449
-So...
-[chatter halts]

01:56.533 --> 01:59.452
...let's talk next steps, hmm?

01:59.536 --> 02:00.495
Anna.

02:00.578 --> 02:03.039
Under New York State law,
we have two options,

02:03.123 --> 02:04.833
but both campaigns have to agree.

02:05.875 --> 02:07.794
We redo the election in ten days...

02:09.712 --> 02:10.755
or we flip a coin.

02:11.714 --> 02:13.007
-We flip a coin?
-[Dede splutters]

02:13.091 --> 02:15.635
I am going to throw myself
out that window.

02:15.718 --> 02:17.929
Strictly speaking,
it does not have to be a coin flip.

02:18.429 --> 02:20.306
We pored through the historical records,

02:20.390 --> 02:21.891
and it's actually kind of funny

02:21.975 --> 02:24.227
because you could decide it
any way you want.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.479
In 2006,

02:26.563 --> 02:29.691
there was a Democratic primary
for the 37th House of Representatives,

02:29.774 --> 02:31.734
and Bryce Edgmon won that

02:31.818 --> 02:32.735
with a coin flip.

02:33.945 --> 02:35.029
-[woman] Heads.
-Yes!

02:35.113 --> 02:36.114
Fuck!

02:36.197 --> 02:37.657
[man] In 2017,

02:37.740 --> 02:40.118
there was a tie in a race
for Virginia House of Delegates,

02:40.201 --> 02:42.620
so they put both names
into film canisters,

02:42.704 --> 02:45.415
-and then they pulled it out of a bowl.
-David Yancey.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.458
[reporters chattering]

02:49.460 --> 02:52.046
-[crowd cheering]
-[man] And in Indiana in 1891,

02:52.130 --> 02:53.631
a tie for county treasurer

02:53.715 --> 02:55.341
was decided by a footrace.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.218
Thank Providence!

02:58.469 --> 03:01.514
I'm going to, uh,
give you a moment to discuss.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.435
[Dede] I want a revote.

03:05.768 --> 03:09.939
I am not throwing away
a 30-year political career

03:10.023 --> 03:11.733
for some frigging coin toss.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.276
[Hadassah] Dede, you gotta stay calm.

03:13.359 --> 03:14.736
Let's talk about the trend lines.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.946
A month ago, we were up 30 points,

03:17.280 --> 03:18.281
then ten.

03:18.698 --> 03:19.949
Now, we're tied.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.244
He's trending up, we're trending down.

03:23.786 --> 03:24.996
In ten days,

03:26.122 --> 03:27.248
he's gonna beat you.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.169
But flipping a coin...

03:31.252 --> 03:33.379
[softy] Let's do a revote, okay?
We can win this thing.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.048
-Well, maybe.
-Maybe?

03:35.131 --> 03:38.134
Maybe we could win a revote, but it's
probably less than a 50-50 chance.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.428
-What?
-We got out every possible vote for you,

03:40.511 --> 03:41.554
we still couldn't beat her.

03:41.638 --> 03:44.724
And we'd struggle to repeat that turnout.
I mean, most of your voters are young.

03:44.807 --> 03:47.268
Young people don't like voting,
and what they really don't like

03:47.352 --> 03:48.186
is voting twice.

03:48.269 --> 03:50.230
You think we have better odds
if we flip a coin?

03:50.313 --> 03:51.356
Yeah, kinda.

03:51.439 --> 03:54.859
Maybe we could get them to use, like,
a weighted coin.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.444
One that always comes up heads.

03:56.527 --> 03:58.279
No. I'm not cheating.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.573
So, here's what we would like to suggest.

04:01.449 --> 04:03.952
Let's honor this moment
in political history

04:04.035 --> 04:05.453
with a commemorative coin.

04:06.454 --> 04:08.915
One that my campaign is happy
to be responsible for fabricating.

04:08.998 --> 04:11.000
We'll put my face on one side,
Dede's on the other.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.711
We'll use that coin,
leave the rest to chance.

04:13.795 --> 04:17.298
[laughs] That's bullshit. You think
we're actually gonna let you make the coin

04:17.382 --> 04:18.633
that decides the election?

04:18.716 --> 04:22.011
God, that is just unbelievable!

04:22.095 --> 04:24.389
Well, let's just do a revote.
We'd love to do a revote.

04:24.472 --> 04:26.015
-Okay, that's fine.
-[Payton] Great.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.643
-[Dede] Fine.
-Wait! That's not an official answer.

04:28.726 --> 04:30.061
Hold it, I just have to text here.

04:30.144 --> 04:32.355
My grandson has croup. Oh, God.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.565
"Plenty of fluids,

04:34.649 --> 04:35.650
steam."

04:35.984 --> 04:39.028
And...

04:39.112 --> 04:39.946
send.

04:40.571 --> 04:42.907
Oh, so sorry. He is the apple of my eye.

04:43.449 --> 04:44.325
Okay.

04:45.201 --> 04:46.202
Okay.

04:47.161 --> 04:48.496
I propose...

04:49.080 --> 04:51.791
rock paper scissors.

04:52.917 --> 04:53.793
What?

04:54.836 --> 04:56.796
-Really?
-Really.

04:56.879 --> 04:59.882
I mean, let's be honest.
You're not gonna win a footrace...

04:59.966 --> 05:02.552
-[both laugh]
-...or flipping a cheater-Payton coin.

05:02.844 --> 05:05.596
Let's do the old roshambo!

05:06.055 --> 05:07.140
Best two out of three.

05:07.223 --> 05:10.268
-Right now?
-No, no, no, no. Friday, at noon,

05:10.435 --> 05:13.604
so we have enough time to invite
the camera crews and the press.

05:13.896 --> 05:15.106
Make it a big event.

05:15.189 --> 05:17.150
I mean, this is so ridiculous,

05:17.233 --> 05:18.484
but let's make it a thing.

05:18.568 --> 05:20.903
Come on! It'll be fun.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.698
Yay, democracy, yay, yay, yay!

05:27.368 --> 05:29.120
Okay. Deal.

05:29.912 --> 05:30.955
Deal.

Hadassah would never suggest something
as out of the box as rock paper scissors

07:09.137 --> 07:11.389
unless she had an angle.
She is a calculating...

07:11.722 --> 07:13.724
mmm... merciless operator, and I know that

07:13.808 --> 07:16.811

07:18.813 --> 07:20.440
unless I knew I could game the system.

07:20.523 --> 07:23.025
We should hire a private investigator
and a team of psychiatrists

07:23.109 --> 07:25.820
to do a psychological profile
on Dede Standish to determine

07:25.903 --> 07:27.530
which option she's most likely to play.

We don't have time for any of that, okay?

or something.

09:22.353 --> 09:23.229
You know why?

Because I figured out the secret
to always win at roshambo.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.526
[Dede] There is no strategy

09:28.609 --> 09:29.819
to rock paper scissors.

-It's a game of chance.
-Tell that to the researchers

09:33.531 --> 09:37.159
of the China State Key Laboratory
for Theoretical Physics.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.620
They wrote a paper
on how humans make decisions

09:39.704 --> 09:41.372
in non-competitive,

09:41.455 --> 09:44.792
-noncooperative, strategic actions.
-English, Hadassah.

09:44.875 --> 09:48.462
They had a few hundred students
play 60 games of rock paper scissors each

09:48.546 --> 09:50.047
to see if any patterns emerged.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.173
And, guess what?

09:51.257 --> 09:52.341

But what I did do is watch.

10:05.896 --> 10:08.107
And that's
when I started noticing patterns.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.902

10:11.986 --> 10:13.738
[Dede] Of course they do.

10:13.821 --> 10:17.074
It's their solution to everything:
just bash it into submission.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.785
But assuming Payton starts

10:20.286 --> 10:21.537
with rock,

10:21.621 --> 10:24.957
that means we win round one,

10:25.041 --> 10:27.001
but this is best two out of three.

10:27.084 --> 10:28.919
Well, here's where it gets juicy.

10:29.378 --> 10:30.963
Research found...

10:31.088 --> 10:33.674
that if a player wins a round...

10:33.758 --> 10:36.302
...they're more likely to play
the same play the next round.

10:36.844 --> 10:38.220
So, if you win with paper,

10:38.304 --> 10:41.891
you're feeling good about yourself,
and you wanna keep feeling good,

10:41.974 --> 10:45.728
so you unconsciously choose paper again.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.814
Okay, so what happens to the loser's play
after they lose?

10:48.898 --> 10:51.984
If they lose two in a row,
they get fixated on what's beating them,

10:52.068 --> 10:55.321
so they switch to the thing that will beat
what just beat them.

10:55.571 --> 10:56.405
What?

10:56.906 --> 10:58.866
Dede, this is so simple.

10:58.949 --> 11:00.951
If you lose the first round,

11:01.118 --> 11:05.039
you switch to the thing
that will beat what just beat you.

11:05.122 --> 11:07.416
If you win, you should switch to the thing

11:07.500 --> 11:09.960
that would win against the thing
that you played the first time.

11:10.461 --> 11:12.797
I'm sorry, can you say
that last part again, more slowly?

11:15.841 --> 11:16.884
[groans]

11:18.719 --> 11:21.597
If you win with rock,

11:22.848 --> 11:24.809
play scissors.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.479
If you lose with scissors,

11:28.938 --> 11:30.898
play paper.

11:32.775 --> 11:33.818
Jesus!

11:33.901 --> 11:36.195
You guys wouldn't last five minutes
in prison!

11:39.031 --> 11:41.575
[Dede] This is brilliant,
but there's only one thing

11:41.659 --> 11:43.869
that could throw a wrench
into this master plan.

11:43.953 --> 11:44.829
[Hadassah] Mmm?

11:44.912 --> 11:47.164
What if Payton knows about this study
as well?

11:47.248 --> 11:48.207
[Hadassah gasps]

11:49.834 --> 11:51.460
-What is he doing here?
-I called him.

11:52.211 --> 11:53.462
This is a campaign emergency,

11:53.546 --> 11:56.757
and I wanted everyone involved
to be here to figure out what to do.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.759
Well, I fired him. For cause.

11:58.843 --> 12:01.095
Sorry I went behind your back
and talked to the Times.

12:01.178 --> 12:03.347
I made an executive decision, which,
considering the way

12:03.431 --> 12:06.475
the race tightened on Election Day,
was probably really wise and productive.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.561
Yes, one that you only made
because I called you out

12:08.644 --> 12:09.895
for not being aggressive enough.

12:10.354 --> 12:12.314
I don't know if I wanna work with someone
who can be baited into

12:12.398 --> 12:13.858
an emotional action that easily.

12:13.941 --> 12:17.403
Yes, because we are all just usually
so emotionally stable.

12:17.486 --> 12:20.489
Enough.
Skye, you said it was an emergency.

12:20.656 --> 12:23.367
If you think it's serious enough
to warrant James being here,

12:23.451 --> 12:24.618
then James should be here.

12:24.702 --> 12:25.661
[Skye] Thank you.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.497
An hour ago, I got a visit
from Infinity Jackson.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.374
She gave me this.

12:38.841 --> 12:40.760
[McAfee] Is that an official ballot box?

12:46.182 --> 12:47.391
[Payton] It's still locked.

12:48.392 --> 12:50.436
Oh, my God.
This is a stolen ballot box.

12:50.519 --> 12:52.855
Being in possession of this
is a federal crime, okay?

12:52.938 --> 12:55.524
We have to get out of here
so we can maintain plausible deniability.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.693
Wait, wait. How did Infinity get this?

12:58.944 --> 12:59.779
I stole it.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.114
Well, we stole it.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.533
We being my secret climate action group

13:04.617 --> 13:06.577
called the Climate Underground.

13:06.660 --> 13:08.579
I wanted to call it
the Weather Underground,

13:08.662 --> 13:10.039
but apparently, the name was taken

13:10.122 --> 13:12.208
by some jerks who don't even care
about climate change.

13:12.291 --> 13:15.044
Anyway, I came up with
the ballot-stealing idea all on my own.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.129
I called it "Operation Steal our Planet

13:17.213 --> 13:18.923
from the Boomers
Who are Trying to Kill It."

13:19.006 --> 13:22.218
Mmm, aren't code names supposed to be,
like, shorter than that?

13:22.301 --> 13:24.678
-Yeah, like, an acronym or something?
-Or be clever?

13:24.762 --> 13:27.556
Can we get back to the crime
that could put us in jail for a decade?

13:27.640 --> 13:28.474
Payton,

13:30.100 --> 13:32.937
Dede Standish cannot win this election.

13:33.729 --> 13:36.190
We are in a climate emergency,

13:36.273 --> 13:38.984
and you are the only candidate
that can stop it, so...

13:40.069 --> 13:41.737
I thought to myself, "Infinity,

13:42.404 --> 13:45.199
how can you stop her
from winning this election?

13:46.367 --> 13:48.285
I mean, you could assassinate her,

13:48.369 --> 13:51.038
but that feels extreme
even under these circumstances."

13:51.121 --> 13:54.333
Yeah, I agree with that.
Assassination is never the answer.

13:54.416 --> 13:55.292
[Infinity] Huh.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.128
Then I realized,

13:59.171 --> 14:00.506
this is a local election.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.925
It'll be decided
by just a handful of votes.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.760
What if we made sure

14:04.844 --> 14:07.304
that a bunch of Standish votes
were never counted?

14:07.721 --> 14:09.223
It could throw the election...

14:09.557 --> 14:10.391
to you.

14:11.308 --> 14:13.018
How do you know that
is full of Standish votes?

14:13.102 --> 14:15.729
I found the polling place
with the highest percentage of old voters.

14:15.813 --> 14:16.730
[McAfee] I know that place.

14:16.814 --> 14:19.483
We canvased it. When we asked
what they thought of the environment,

14:19.567 --> 14:21.986
their response was,
because their grandchildren never visit,

14:22.069 --> 14:24.446
they hope to leave behind
a hellhole for them to live in.

14:25.906 --> 14:28.200
[Infinity] I read this study
by these Canadian scientists

14:28.284 --> 14:31.161
that said old people
are more easily distracted

14:31.245 --> 14:34.123
because a part of their brain called
the locus coeruleus is deteriorated,

14:34.206 --> 14:37.668
so I knew it wouldn't take much
to draw their attention.

14:38.002 --> 14:40.004
[people murmuring]

14:43.257 --> 14:45.801
Also, if there's one thing

14:46.010 --> 14:48.762
that old people cannot resist,

14:49.763 --> 14:50.890
it's mimes.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.564
[people cheering]

15:02.610 --> 15:04.320
There are probably 300 ballots
in this box.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.739
That's more than enough
to give the election to Dede.

15:06.822 --> 15:08.616
This is bad. [breathing heavily]

15:08.699 --> 15:09.867
Oh, God, this is really bad.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.493
Worse than when you didn't have cancer,

15:11.577 --> 15:13.162
-and I didn't tell anyone.
-Th-- That bad?

15:13.245 --> 15:15.331
It's that bad, Infinity.
We are all going to jail.

15:15.414 --> 15:16.248
[Skye] I'm not.

15:16.332 --> 15:18.792
[chuckles]
I'd turn on all of you in a heartbeat.

15:19.209 --> 15:20.294
You saw that election board.

15:20.377 --> 15:22.588
They told us they don't have
a sense of humor, right?

15:22.671 --> 15:25.174
Don't think you're gonna find stealing
their ballot box funny.

15:25.257 --> 15:28.177
In fact, I think they'd probably find it
definitively unfunny.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.345
Payton, we are at war.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.555
The biggest,
most important war of all time.

15:31.639 --> 15:32.723
Every single day counts.

15:32.806 --> 15:34.975
Two years with you
with the power to do something

15:35.059 --> 15:36.852
could be the difference
between life and death.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.647
Our planet is being murdered
by people like Dede Standish.

15:39.730 --> 15:40.814
Okay? This is...

15:42.024 --> 15:42.983
not a crime.

15:45.110 --> 15:46.403
It's self-defense.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.116
Okay, so? What are we gonna do?

15:51.742 --> 15:53.202
Like it or not, we're in it now.

15:53.285 --> 15:55.287
We could crack it open
and count the votes,

15:55.371 --> 15:57.373
and if it helps us,
we turn it in anonymously,

15:57.456 --> 15:58.791
and if not, we burn them.

15:58.874 --> 16:00.250
Okay. Now that we've considered

16:00.334 --> 16:02.670
the most dishonest version
of what we should do,

16:02.753 --> 16:03.837
what are some other options?

16:03.921 --> 16:04.755
We could just...

16:05.130 --> 16:06.882
leave it on the doorstep
of a police station,

16:06.966 --> 16:08.384
like an unwanted baby.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.928
And risk them using DNA and fingerprints
to find out who did it? Mm-mm.

16:11.011 --> 16:12.888
Or we could do
a full Frank Capra integrity play

16:12.972 --> 16:14.932
and hold a press conference
and tell the truth.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.809
Yeah, and then I go to jail, so...

16:17.393 --> 16:18.978
Oh, God, I need time to think.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.188
There is no time.
We're in possession of stolen ballots.

16:21.271 --> 16:23.190
Don't you think I know?
Do I look like an idiot?

16:23.273 --> 16:24.525
[James] I'll look after it.

16:24.608 --> 16:26.610
I'd like to regain your trust.

16:28.028 --> 16:28.862
If you'll let me.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.784
I don't wanna know
where you're keeping them.

16:34.243 --> 16:36.996
Nobody talks to each other or about this
until we can fix it.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.543
Astrid, I never...

16:43.669 --> 16:46.213
I never thanked you
for not causing any trouble for Payton

16:46.296 --> 16:47.381
before the election.

16:47.798 --> 16:49.425
It's probably just pregnancy hormones.

16:49.717 --> 16:50.676
[Alice] That's not true.

16:50.759 --> 16:53.220
[voice breaks]
Our reaction to your baby news was cruel.

16:53.303 --> 16:55.639
[sobbing softly]

16:55.723 --> 16:58.434
-I'm sorry. [gasping breaths]
-That's fine.

16:58.517 --> 17:01.228
-It happens to me all the time.
-It's not because I'm pregnant.

17:01.311 --> 17:03.647
[gasping] Well, it is, but... [exhales]

17:04.148 --> 17:05.065
...it's because...

17:07.609 --> 17:10.404
I don't like the parents
that this baby is gonna have.

17:10.988 --> 17:13.741
No, you and Payton will be great parents.

17:14.533 --> 17:16.076
Pretty good ones, at least.

17:17.786 --> 17:19.413
You'll definitely be better than mine.

17:19.496 --> 17:22.207
I don't like who we've become. [sniffles]

17:22.791 --> 17:25.002
What politics has turned us into.

17:25.502 --> 17:27.880
Payton is exactly the same
as he's always been.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.049
What it's turned me into.

17:31.508 --> 17:33.719
I'm selfish,

17:34.762 --> 17:35.929
I'm unkind,

17:36.513 --> 17:39.641
I'm willing to cheat,

17:39.767 --> 17:42.770
to... wreck lives, if necessary.

17:42.853 --> 17:44.855
How do you know
that's not just who you are?

17:46.023 --> 17:47.733
Politics hasn't changed you.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.736
It just so happens to be the perfect job

17:50.819 --> 17:53.280
for your particular moral
and ethical skill set.

17:54.698 --> 17:56.075
I got into Harvard.

17:57.367 --> 17:58.494
Payton didn't.

18:00.370 --> 18:02.998
I was the one who told him to run
on the climate.

18:03.082 --> 18:06.418
I was the one encouraging him
to play fair.

18:06.835 --> 18:10.589
I've deferred my entire life to him.

18:11.381 --> 18:14.218
Taken on his worst qualities to serve...

18:15.761 --> 18:17.054
his dreams...

18:18.263 --> 18:19.139
and ego.

18:25.896 --> 18:27.064
[Astrid sighs]

18:27.648 --> 18:30.484
I can't argue with you there.
You've been his bitch since I met you.

18:31.568 --> 18:33.695
Thank you for always speaking straight
to me. [sniffles]

18:33.779 --> 18:36.490
My father always said
my coldness was my greatest asset.

18:40.786 --> 18:41.829
Screw Payton.

18:42.579 --> 18:43.747
Screw everyone.

18:44.123 --> 18:47.000
We should just get out of this town
and never look back.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.003
[Alice laughs, sniffles]

18:51.255 --> 18:53.799
Running away isn't gonna help anything.
[sniffles]

18:54.133 --> 18:56.760
Running away was the best thing
I did with my life.

18:56.844 --> 19:00.055
When I got far enough, I realized
I wasn't running from anything important,

19:00.139 --> 19:02.558
I was running to the life
I actually wanted.

19:10.274 --> 19:12.025
Is the fetus going with him?

19:13.610 --> 19:15.112
I don't think so.

19:17.072 --> 19:17.906
You know...

19:18.448 --> 19:20.576
uh, this may sound strange, Hadassah,

19:20.659 --> 19:23.954
but even though Marcus lied to me,
I still feel terrible for him.

19:24.663 --> 19:27.457
He's losing his wife, his home,

19:27.916 --> 19:31.044
and his young, gay lover,
all in the span of a few days.

19:31.753 --> 19:34.214
He'll probably lose his job, too.

19:34.590 --> 19:37.092
Writing those papers for those students.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.303
Please. He has tenure.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.597
He could be murdering cats
on the Internet

19:41.680 --> 19:43.432
and he'd still keep his teaching job.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.684
-Oh, God.
-Look, it's the right thing, Dede.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.687
Politically,
Marcus was gonna drag you down

19:48.770 --> 19:50.689
like a tweed-blazered anchor.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.024
But, personally,

19:52.107 --> 19:54.568
he's a liar!

19:54.651 --> 19:57.446
And he clearly leans very heavily

19:57.863 --> 20:00.324
towards the gay end
of the Kinsey spectrum.

20:00.741 --> 20:01.575
Clearly.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.203
[Dede sighs heavily]

20:05.078 --> 20:06.955
I am...

20:08.123 --> 20:12.211
so tired, Hadassah, of the game.

20:12.294 --> 20:15.631
You can't be tired of the game.

20:15.714 --> 20:18.008
That's like saying
you're tired of breathing.

20:18.300 --> 20:21.345
Or you're tired of the chicken parm
at Elio's.

20:21.428 --> 20:23.430
You are the game.
You've been defined by the game

20:23.513 --> 20:25.849
-for four decades.
-[sighs]

20:25.933 --> 20:28.644
-What are you gonna do? Take up golf?
-No.

20:28.727 --> 20:31.563
Or play Rummikub
at-- at the nursing home?

20:31.647 --> 20:34.024
You gonna join the board
of a bullshit start-up?

20:34.107 --> 20:36.777
Oh, God, just saying those words
gives me the creeps.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.862
Oh, so does staying the course.

20:39.321 --> 20:40.656
You know I love governing.

20:40.739 --> 20:44.701
It's the campaigning part of the job
that I never liked.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.620
And one of the only things
that kept me going

20:46.703 --> 20:49.873
was that I didn't have to worry
about running again. God.

20:50.374 --> 20:51.291
[Dede sighs]

20:56.088 --> 20:57.381
Oh, my God.

20:59.424 --> 21:00.550
Ugh.

21:01.635 --> 21:04.471
It's a new world, Hadassah.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.348
Since AOC,

21:06.431 --> 21:08.183
no incumbent is safe.

21:11.144 --> 21:13.021
We may win this,

21:14.398 --> 21:16.108
but we've shown weakness.

21:16.650 --> 21:22.239
No one is ever going to let us
run unopposed again.

21:22.322 --> 21:23.323
You were excited.

21:23.448 --> 21:24.866
You were excited about running

21:24.950 --> 21:27.119
-for vice president.
-Yes, of course I was!

21:27.202 --> 21:29.538
But you and I know
what makes that different.

21:29.621 --> 21:31.498
We would be busting our asses,

21:31.581 --> 21:34.293
flying around the globe on Air Force Two.

21:34.376 --> 21:38.547
We would be negotiating giant deals
with major leaders.

21:38.797 --> 21:41.800
I would be the first woman...

21:42.509 --> 21:46.513
to be this close to the presidency.

21:46.888 --> 21:49.599
I just-- It's a little different

21:49.808 --> 21:51.435
than busting our asses

21:51.518 --> 21:52.811
up in Albany

21:52.894 --> 21:55.022
to try to pass some fucking bill

21:55.105 --> 21:56.398
to get some light bulbs

21:56.481 --> 21:58.358
-in some fucking street lamps.
-No.

21:58.775 --> 22:01.153
You're not giving up yet.
You'll miss it too much.

22:01.236 --> 22:03.822
The-- The-- The fame,
the respect, the driver.

22:03.905 --> 22:05.282
-[chuckles]
-The luggage tags

22:05.365 --> 22:07.826
that say "Senate Leader Standish" on them?

22:08.493 --> 22:10.787
And, woman to woman, I won't let you.

22:11.246 --> 22:13.415
Look at those old farts in Congress.

22:13.498 --> 22:16.585
Nothing but big, swollen prostates
and Brooks Brothers suits.

22:16.668 --> 22:19.254
You don't see them walking away
because they're tired.

22:19.338 --> 22:22.007
No! They hang on to power,

22:22.174 --> 22:26.094
even if it means wetting themselves
at the State of the Union.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.515
-Take a lesson.
-You...

22:31.933 --> 22:32.934
Hadassah...

22:34.644 --> 22:36.021
this is gonna be good for you.

22:36.897 --> 22:37.731
Yeah.

22:38.648 --> 22:39.858
Just think...

22:40.734 --> 22:43.779
how a new candidate could recharge you.

22:43.862 --> 22:44.738
You--

22:45.197 --> 22:47.657
You've been with me for so long.

22:48.492 --> 22:49.451
[chuckles]

22:49.534 --> 22:51.745
A fresh start will be good for you.

22:51.995 --> 22:54.456
But I don't wanna work
for anybody but you.

22:54.790 --> 22:57.793
I wanna keep going
until we go over the cliff.

22:58.835 --> 23:00.295
Like Thelma and Louise.

23:03.590 --> 23:04.633
I wanna win this,

23:05.675 --> 23:06.802
you know I do,

23:08.011 --> 23:09.429
but no matter what,

23:10.680 --> 23:11.598
I'm sorry.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.644
It's the last race I'm gonna run.

23:16.937 --> 23:17.854
[sighs]

23:24.778 --> 23:26.863
[fire crackles softly]

23:30.534 --> 23:31.785
Made any progress?

23:31.868 --> 23:35.163
I'm just playing out every possible
scenario in my mind. [sniffs]

23:35.247 --> 23:38.083
Like a Choose Your Own Adventure book,
but every ending sucks.

23:38.792 --> 23:40.127
To be, or not to be.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.711
Exactly. [sighing]

23:42.295 --> 23:45.298
Oh, and the worst part of this is,
we didn't even make this mess.

23:46.425 --> 23:47.843
It was thrust upon us.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.094
Maybe.

23:50.137 --> 23:52.514
Nobody asked Infinity
to steal that ballot box.

23:52.597 --> 23:53.432
But...

23:54.266 --> 23:57.144
maybe we created
an environment of moral ambiguity

23:57.227 --> 23:59.896
that made her think that
doing that for us was okay.

23:59.980 --> 24:02.274
Alice, this is hard enough
without you blaming us for it.

24:05.527 --> 24:06.445
I'm leaving...

24:07.237 --> 24:09.072
Manhattan, this campaign...

24:10.866 --> 24:11.867
you.

24:12.367 --> 24:13.994
I think that maybe...

24:15.662 --> 24:17.289
we are bad people.

24:17.497 --> 24:18.582
No, that's not right.

24:18.748 --> 24:20.500
I think that I've...

24:21.501 --> 24:23.336
become a bad person.

24:23.670 --> 24:24.921
Because you're with me?

24:25.839 --> 24:26.673
Yes.

24:26.756 --> 24:27.883
[Payton chuckles softly]

24:27.966 --> 24:29.968
I don't think that you're a bad person.

24:31.553 --> 24:33.847
I think that you're indifferent

24:34.347 --> 24:35.974
to morality and ethics.

24:36.057 --> 24:38.894
I think that you struggle
with these kinds of ethical conundrums

24:38.977 --> 24:40.854
because you think that you're supposed to,

24:40.937 --> 24:43.190
but you only choose the side of light
when it means

24:43.273 --> 24:45.650
that you'll still probably get
what you want.

24:45.734 --> 24:46.693
That's not true.

24:46.776 --> 24:48.069
Do you want examples?

24:49.571 --> 24:52.491
When we go to the movies, you put
your jacket on the chair next to you

24:52.574 --> 24:56.328
-to make sure no one else takes it.
-Uh, excuse me. Is someone sitting there?

24:56.453 --> 24:58.747
Oh, yeah, I think so.
He just dropped his coat and ran out.

24:58.830 --> 25:00.290
I think he's at concession stand.

25:06.171 --> 25:07.005
[Payton] Seriously?

25:07.088 --> 25:09.132
That's the evidence
that I'm morally bankrupt?

25:09.216 --> 25:11.009
That I don't want to share an armrest?

25:11.092 --> 25:12.302
[Alice] It's the principle.

25:12.385 --> 25:14.554
We are members of a community
in a theater.

25:14.638 --> 25:16.389
You are putting your comfort

25:16.473 --> 25:18.475
over the comfort of every other member.

25:19.643 --> 25:20.519
You also lie.

25:21.102 --> 25:22.020
A lot.

25:22.103 --> 25:25.440
You're always telling people
you can be somewhere, even if you can't.

25:25.565 --> 25:27.901
And then you lie
about why you can't make it.

25:27.984 --> 25:30.946
Yes. Yes, no, Rabbi, I know I promised
to attend Sukkoth services

25:31.029 --> 25:32.989
in exchange for your endorsement.
Here's the thing.

25:33.073 --> 25:35.951
Some shiksa waitress served me real bread
instead of gluten-free bread

25:36.034 --> 25:38.745
at breakfast today, and I'm
in the worst gastrointestinal distress,

25:38.828 --> 25:41.081
and... yeah. Uh-huh. Yes, exactly.

25:41.164 --> 25:42.749
Serves me right for being born Ashkenazi.

25:43.208 --> 25:44.834
Okeydokey, thank you for understanding.

25:45.919 --> 25:47.045
[groans]

25:48.171 --> 25:50.298
That's not lying, that's politics.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.424
You promise everything,

25:51.508 --> 25:53.552
and then you embellish
when you can't follow through.

25:53.635 --> 25:56.555
For God's sakes, Alice, people expect me
to lie to them about that stuff.

25:56.638 --> 25:59.140
How about the fact
that this office has been stealing Wi-Fi

25:59.224 --> 26:01.768
from the Indian restaurant downstairs
since we moved in?

26:01.851 --> 26:03.895
We're running
on a shoestring budget here. Okay?

26:03.979 --> 26:07.607
If we win, I'll report the Wi-Fi
to the FEC as an in-kind contribution.

26:07.691 --> 26:11.111
There's always a rationalization
for everything.

26:12.362 --> 26:15.949
Don't you see that
that's why Infinity thought

26:16.032 --> 26:18.243
it was okay to steal the election for you?

26:18.326 --> 26:21.788
That she was just following your lead
and rationalizing away any guilt?

26:21.871 --> 26:25.792
Just like you did when you put her life
in danger in high school.

26:26.835 --> 26:28.086
Just like you did

26:28.169 --> 26:32.424
when you didn't turn around to look at me
when we passed each other in the hall.

26:32.507 --> 26:33.967
Is that what this is all about?

26:35.260 --> 26:37.178
Have you really not forgiven me
for that yet?

26:37.596 --> 26:39.931
You know
that's the biggest regret of my life.

26:41.224 --> 26:42.225
It's that.

26:42.309 --> 26:43.435
[breath trembling]

26:43.977 --> 26:46.521
It's also the fact
that I have been there

26:46.605 --> 26:48.648
for every one of those things.

26:49.899 --> 26:52.402
I'm an even worse rationalizer
than you are.

26:52.485 --> 26:54.446
I-- I have turned to the dark side

26:54.529 --> 26:58.366
and lost any concept of a moral code
for anything.

26:58.450 --> 27:01.620
I mean, at least you can tell yourself
you're doing it for your dream.

27:01.703 --> 27:04.331
Our dream. Our dream.

27:04.414 --> 27:05.999
No, your dream.

27:07.917 --> 27:10.629
I don't even know what mine is.

27:10.712 --> 27:11.546
Okay.

27:12.422 --> 27:14.382
So then, let's figure out what that is.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.802
Right? And then...
And then, I promise you,

27:18.595 --> 27:21.556
I will do everything in my power
to make that come true. Okay?

27:21.640 --> 27:22.474
I owe you that.

27:23.350 --> 27:24.726
After the election.

27:24.809 --> 27:25.644
Yeah, of course.

27:30.940 --> 27:31.775
And what if...

27:33.276 --> 27:35.862
my dream interferes with yours?

27:37.364 --> 27:40.992
Are you willing to put yours on hold
to make mine come true?

27:41.910 --> 27:43.411
But why would we have to do that?

27:43.495 --> 27:45.121
I'm asking if you would.

27:46.831 --> 27:50.126
[sputters] Yeah, yes, yeah.
Absolutely, yes.

27:53.963 --> 27:54.839
Okay?

28:03.139 --> 28:05.767
I'm not some rabbi looking for you
to come to temple

28:05.850 --> 28:07.435
in exchange for an endorsement.

28:13.274 --> 28:15.485
Okay. Yeah, just go. Just walk out.

28:15.568 --> 28:18.196
You got practice leaving men
as things are about to get serious.

28:18.279 --> 28:19.906
I left Thad for you!

28:19.989 --> 28:22.534
You're the one
who wanted to bring Astrid into our bed

28:22.617 --> 28:25.078
so that you could shut her up, okay?
You're no better than I am!

28:25.161 --> 28:26.246
You're right.

28:27.580 --> 28:30.083
But leaving you is the only way
I can be certain.

28:31.334 --> 28:33.128
[breathes deeply]

28:33.712 --> 28:34.754
Goodbye, Payton.

28:43.096 --> 28:45.265
[Georgina] I didn't come
all the way across the country

28:45.348 --> 28:46.850
to watch you starve yourself.

28:48.143 --> 28:50.019
[Payton]
I'm in a constant state of nausea.

28:51.020 --> 28:53.648
I've never experienced
this complicated a moral dilemma.

28:55.650 --> 28:58.153
Or is it an ethical dilemma?
I can never remember the difference.

28:58.236 --> 29:01.865
Ethics are the rules
that social systems provide us,

29:02.323 --> 29:06.619
and morals are the principles
which we govern ourselves by.

29:06.995 --> 29:08.079
That's why I'm struggling.

29:08.163 --> 29:10.081
Am I confused about
what I'm supposed to do

29:10.498 --> 29:13.209
because the culture says
that it matters that I do the right thing,

29:13.501 --> 29:15.712
or does doing the right thing...

29:16.463 --> 29:17.756
actually matter to me?

29:17.839 --> 29:19.048
Who cares?

29:19.132 --> 29:20.091
I care, Mom.

29:20.175 --> 29:22.343
This is a defining moment
in my life and career.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.471
Every politician has his or her crossroads

29:24.554 --> 29:27.682
when they finally have to choose one path
or the other.

29:27.766 --> 29:31.478
So do I tell myself that,
no matter what I have to do,

29:31.853 --> 29:32.854
what rules I break,

29:32.937 --> 29:34.856
or people I have to kill,

29:34.939 --> 29:36.399
backroom deals I have to cut,

29:36.483 --> 29:39.152
I'm still a white knight
because I'm fighting for what's right?

29:39.235 --> 29:41.196
Or am I a man of core values?

29:41.279 --> 29:44.365
Am I a champion of truth and integrity

29:44.449 --> 29:47.494
who's willing to sacrifice what's good
for what's right?

29:47.577 --> 29:49.662
Am I ethical or moral?

29:51.039 --> 29:51.873
Or neither?

29:53.124 --> 29:55.293
You know,
am I Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton?

29:55.752 --> 29:56.669
Or Lyndon Johnson?

29:56.753 --> 29:58.087
Clinton was reelected.

29:58.171 --> 29:59.130
[scoffs]

29:59.214 --> 30:02.842
Ethics says
you should turn this ballot box over

30:02.926 --> 30:04.260
and explain what happened.

30:05.512 --> 30:07.013
There will be an investigation,

30:07.096 --> 30:10.099
Infinity will probably get arrested,
and they will count the votes.

30:10.183 --> 30:13.102
I'd lose and be tainted,
and I'd send my friend to jail.

30:14.562 --> 30:16.147
-What's the moral thing?
-I told you.

30:16.231 --> 30:18.441
Morality is how we govern ourselves.

30:19.108 --> 30:21.694
You can throw that ballot box
in the East River,

30:21.778 --> 30:25.573
but can you live with the consequences
to your conscience?

30:25.657 --> 30:27.575
What if I hear the ballots
from down there constantly?

30:27.659 --> 30:29.160
Like that guy from The Tell-Tale Heart?

30:31.371 --> 30:34.582
You once said that
my ambition frightened you.

30:34.666 --> 30:37.168
Is that what you're talking about?
Did you always know that I...

30:37.252 --> 30:38.086
[sighs]

30:38.169 --> 30:39.504
...had the capacity to live

30:39.587 --> 30:42.590
outside the normal boundaries of ethics
and morals?

30:44.008 --> 30:45.552
When you were a little boy,

30:45.635 --> 30:49.722
you used to love to steal
cookies and candy from the pantry.

30:50.515 --> 30:52.725
Your father never really noticed
any of you,

30:52.809 --> 30:56.062
but he was a true prude about sweets.

30:57.146 --> 30:58.481
I'm not sure if it was...

31:00.191 --> 31:03.903
that he was worried about obesity
or he was shorting sugar stocks

31:03.987 --> 31:05.989
or maybe it was
that Katie Couric documentary,

31:06.072 --> 31:07.782
but he was adamant.

31:08.283 --> 31:11.202
I outwardly agreed,
but then looked the other way

31:11.286 --> 31:12.745
when you did your pilfering.

31:12.829 --> 31:16.666
Are you saying that you think it's okay
to steal under certain circumstances?

31:16.749 --> 31:17.667
I would watch you

31:17.834 --> 31:21.588
after you took a sleeve of Oreos
or a bag of Swedish Fish,

31:21.671 --> 31:24.674
and for the first hour or so,

31:24.757 --> 31:28.845
you would be paranoid
and agitated and upset.

31:28.928 --> 31:33.892
At first, I thought
that you felt guilty over being dishonest,

31:33.975 --> 31:35.894
but after a while,

31:37.061 --> 31:39.314
when you realized
that you hadn't been caught,

31:40.273 --> 31:41.941
you would start to relax.

31:42.025 --> 31:46.821
Not only relax,
you would get a skip in your step.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.699
-Sugar high?
-No.

31:49.782 --> 31:51.868
Because I think, for you,

31:52.702 --> 31:55.830
the best part was realizing
that you had gotten away with it.

31:57.624 --> 31:59.167
You are who you are, Payton.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.794
I think you've known exactly
what you're going to do

32:01.878 --> 32:04.172
with that ballot box
from the moment you saw it.

32:04.589 --> 32:08.968
Your struggle isn't deciding
what you're going to do.

32:11.054 --> 32:13.640
It's accepting who you are.

32:22.607 --> 32:24.943
Congratulations on winning your election,
Mom.

32:25.026 --> 32:26.319
I'm very proud of you.

32:28.112 --> 32:29.364
Are you gonna eat anything?

32:31.449 --> 32:33.409
I'm gonna get stoned and have a bath.

32:46.255 --> 32:49.008
-We're gonna do nothing about the box.
-Are you sure?

32:50.009 --> 32:50.927
Alice left me.

32:52.178 --> 32:53.554
All I have left is my career

32:54.639 --> 32:55.640
and my dream,

32:56.641 --> 32:59.143
so I will make it to the White House.

33:01.187 --> 33:03.606
Even if I have to lie and cheat

33:03.815 --> 33:06.985
and... burn the world down to get there.

33:14.784 --> 33:17.203
