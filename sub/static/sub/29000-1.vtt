-Oh, thank you, Griffin.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.139

-[Griffin] No problem, gorgeous.

02:20.274 --> 02:23.475
-[all] ¶<i> Happy birthday to you ¶</i>
-[man] Whose is it?

02:23.477 --> 02:24.810
[Ray] Now you blow.

02:24.812 --> 02:28.647
Yeah, that's... Didn't she used
to have super breath that's--

02:28.649 --> 02:30.616
Hurricane Jane,
they used to call her.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.851
Do you know her breath
was once measured

02:32.853 --> 02:35.654
at 516 miles per hour?

02:35.656 --> 02:37.523
The highest speed
ever recorded on

02:37.525 --> 02:40.225
-the Beaufort wind force scale.
-Imagine the blowjobs.

02:40.394 --> 02:41.793
[men laughing]

02:41.795 --> 02:44.429
[Ted] No, no, technically,
a blowjob is a misnomer

02:44.431 --> 02:47.633
because it involves the creation
of a vacuum via a suction

02:47.635 --> 02:49.334
rather than exhalation of air,

02:49.336 --> 02:50.769
which was Hurricane Jane's
power.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.054
When he was your sidekick,

02:52.055 --> 02:53.338
how could you resist
kicking his ass?

02:53.340 --> 02:56.675
-Oh, self-control, earplugs.
-[laughs]

02:56.844 --> 02:58.844
-[Ray] How long does this go on?
-[blows]

02:58.846 --> 03:02.481
Ready?
Give us a good blow, sweetheart.

-[indistinct chatter]
-[man] That's not nice.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.390
My tatties.

03:12.226 --> 03:15.961
Blow that, Rainbow. [laughs]

03:16.530 --> 03:19.198
-[Ray] In your pocket, buddy.
-[laughing]

03:19.533 --> 03:21.833
-Okay, don't.
-[Pendle] No, steady, Jerry.

03:22.269 --> 03:24.403
-Glasgow...
-[Ray] Jerry, Jerry.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.605
-...Rainbow.
-[Ray] Jerry.

03:29.843 --> 03:31.944
[Jerry]
I can't fucking control it.

03:34.949 --> 03:36.515
Christ, that's,

03:36.850 --> 03:39.484
that's one
bollocksed wheelchair.

03:39.653 --> 03:42.454
-Sorry, Windsor.
-[Windsor] Oh, that's all right.

03:42.456 --> 03:45.891
Luckily,
I landed on my colostomy bag.

03:45.893 --> 03:48.927
[Jerry] Oh, that's
really shocking. Sorry.

03:49.496 --> 03:51.363
Look, here at Dunmanor,

03:51.365 --> 03:53.398
we want you to have
as much freedom as possible.

03:53.634 --> 03:55.767
And we recognize
that your powers

03:55.769 --> 03:57.369
are part of who you are.

03:57.705 --> 04:00.772
But when those powers create
an unsafe environment

04:00.774 --> 04:01.907
-for the other residents...
-[coughing]

04:01.909 --> 04:02.908
...it is a concern.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.944
Now the last thing we want
is to have to downwardly manage

04:04.945 --> 04:06.979
your powers for the safety
of others.

04:06.981 --> 04:09.448
-Downwardly manage my nut sack.
-[coughing]

04:09.450 --> 04:11.650
-Now, now, fellas.
-[Alicia] So please,

04:11.652 --> 04:13.585
let's not have
any more incidents

04:13.587 --> 04:15.520
like Jerry's act
of super incontinence.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.822
Now, on a happier note,

04:18.024 --> 04:20.425
Hero Day is coming around again.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.043
-[man 1] Yeah?
-[man 2] Whoa!

04:22.045 --> 04:23.662
-[all chattering]
-[Alicia] So, a lovely chance

04:23.664 --> 04:25.864
to meet all your many fans.

04:25.866 --> 04:28.433
And this year, we're hoping
there'll be an appearance

04:28.435 --> 04:30.869
from one of the world's
most admired superheroes.

04:30.871 --> 04:33.038
-Maximum Justice.
-Celestro.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.339

04:34.341 --> 04:37.609
Oh, fuck that no talent

04:37.611 --> 04:39.845
Yes, thank you, Raymond.
So, hope to see you all there.

04:39.847 --> 04:42.748
Oh, and don't forget
your blood tests this weekend

04:42.750 --> 04:45.550
-will be in the Lee room.
-[Pendle] Ah.

04:45.552 --> 04:48.020
Dolores, darling,
what a pretty blouse.

04:48.022 --> 04:50.522
-No, I will not.
-Sorry?

04:50.524 --> 04:53.592

was some afro you had back then.

Yep. It was like
a black thunder cloud.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.719
Looked exactly like me.

09:47.721 --> 09:50.822
And another one

09:50.824 --> 09:53.091
Yeah.
The boy licked it and died.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.926

10:23.957 --> 10:25.323
Why did they let them in here?

10:26.059 --> 10:28.159
Why did they make us crap

-with the bad guys?
-Why don't you just use
a different toilet?

10:32.065 --> 10:33.999
Is he really a bad guy though?

-Come on, Ted, she didn't die.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.796
-She ran off with the pool guy.
-She was taken from me.

12:11.798 --> 12:15.066
-I never saw that coming.
-I never saw anything coming.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.268
And I could see into the past.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.337
Well, you know who else
could see in the past, Windsor?

12:19.740 --> 12:22.474
Everybody.
It's called remembering shit.

12:22.876 --> 12:25.510
Come on, is this all we got
to look forward to,

12:25.512 --> 12:28.847
having our powers
downwardly managed

12:28.849 --> 12:30.682
for our own safety

12:30.683 --> 12:32.516
until eventually we just slip
into a coma and...

12:33.386 --> 12:36.855
watch endless reruns
of <i> Murder, She Wrote?</i>

12:36.857 --> 12:38.123
It doesn't have to end that way.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.524
-[sighs]
-They show <i> Quincy</i>

12:39.526 --> 12:41.292
in the afternoons now, too.

12:41.495 --> 12:43.294
Enough of all this self-pity.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.396
I'm gonna throw myself a nice,
deep bath

12:45.398 --> 12:47.132
and some perfume, some...

12:48.068 --> 12:49.033
incense...

12:49.035 --> 12:53.004
-all that good shit.
-[Ted] I think I'll join you...

12:53.473 --> 12:55.240
in my own bath, I mean.

12:55.375 --> 12:56.775
-On my own.
-[sighs]

12:59.146 --> 13:01.379
[Jerry] Glasgow Rainbow.

13:04.451 --> 13:09.020
-[indistinct chatter]
-[pants]

13:16.062 --> 13:17.195
[Ray] Jerry?

13:24.004 --> 13:25.069
Jerry?

13:35.448 --> 13:36.848
Flynn?

13:38.318 --> 13:40.885
[car engine revving]

13:47.527 --> 13:50.929
[wind howling]

13:50.931 --> 13:54.566
By the power of Baldur's forge.

13:59.906 --> 14:02.974
Ah, bloody Baldur's forge.

14:16.590 --> 14:20.124
What an absolute honor
to have Madera Moonlight,

14:20.126 --> 14:22.460
the one and only,
here at Dunmanor.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.896
Ah, just Madera, thank you.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.564
Or Moonlight, of course,

14:26.566 --> 14:28.499
if you prefer to be
more informal.

14:28.501 --> 14:32.403
Ah, we prefer not to use
the old superhero nom de plumes

14:32.405 --> 14:33.822
here at the manor.

14:33.823 --> 14:35.240
It encourages a bit too much
excitement.

14:35.242 --> 14:38.977
-[chuckles] Perish the thought.
-[laughs]

14:39.379 --> 14:42.280
The Kirby dining room
is through there.

14:42.282 --> 14:45.350
Three sittings a day
with a menu to die for.

14:45.352 --> 14:46.517
-[chuckles]
-[Madera] Hmm, delightful.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.891
Oh, thank you.

14:55.195 --> 14:56.928
Total Thunder.

14:57.664 --> 15:00.632
[grunts]
I mean, Pendle Carpenter.

15:00.967 --> 15:04.636
-Madera Moonlight. Whoa!
-[Madera laughs]

15:04.638 --> 15:06.237
You have not changed a bit,
girl.

15:06.239 --> 15:09.540
Oh, I know you're lying
but I like the way you do it.

15:11.478 --> 15:13.211
[chuckles]

15:13.212 --> 15:14.945
-[inhales]
-[Madera] Raymond Windesky.

15:15.916 --> 15:19.584
Oh, oh my, Ray.

15:20.253 --> 15:24.322
-How the devil are you?
-I'm fine. Fine, Moonlight.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.224
Oh, well.

15:27.294 --> 15:30.695
Two ex-boyfriends
under one roof. Mm.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.298
What could possibly go wrong?

15:34.634 --> 15:36.567
-[Ray groans]
-[glass breaks]

15:36.569 --> 15:37.702
Whoo.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.888
Nothing's gonna go right for you
with that big gut you got there.

15:39.889 --> 15:42.073
-[laughs]
-Hey, never mind that.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.641
I saw something strange
in Jerry's room.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.376
Don't keep nosing
around Jerry's room, man.

15:45.612 --> 15:49.213
This is gonna be too easy.
I will see you on the track.

15:52.252 --> 15:56.721
[thudding]

16:00.360 --> 16:02.226
[groans] Sorry.

16:02.228 --> 16:04.329
I'd never get a job
at Downton Abbey.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.431
What's this here?

16:08.201 --> 16:10.668
I can tell your religion
in that outfit.

16:11.338 --> 16:14.072
[sighs]
Yes, well, thanks for your help.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.306
It's like there's,

16:15.308 --> 16:18.609
there's a camel somewhere, yeah,
missing a toe.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.714
-You get it?
-I'm afraid I do, which is why

16:22.716 --> 16:24.115
I'm taking that back.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.250
-Run along now.
-That's...

16:26.252 --> 16:28.119
Oh, and I'll take this, too.

16:28.121 --> 16:30.088
Oh no, that's my own
personal use supply.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.289
-That's-- That's--
-Uh-huh, uh-huh.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.290
I got to...

16:46.206 --> 16:48.573
-[Ted] Oh.
-I'm so, so sorry.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.441
No, no, I, uh...

16:51.311 --> 16:52.477
No, I...

16:58.485 --> 17:00.051
Oh, my goodness.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.086
Oh.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.723
-The blood test detected it.
-Hmm.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.227
Metastasis rate,
when combined

17:09.229 --> 17:12.296
with a normal hematopoietic
cell count would indicate.

17:14.134 --> 17:19.303
So, maybe you have time
to put your affairs in order?

17:22.375 --> 17:24.442
Shall I call any family for you?

17:24.778 --> 17:26.711
-I haven't got any.
-Ted.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.313
As my old mom used to say,

17:29.516 --> 17:32.750
"It's just one
of life's little upsy-daisies."

17:33.720 --> 17:35.086
It's cancer.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.754
I know it is, Ted,

17:36.756 --> 17:39.624
and I know what it's like
to receive horrendous news.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.459
I remember the day
my father died.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.795
He was in a building
that collapsed.

17:43.797 --> 17:46.164
I thought my life
wasn't worth living after that.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.066
But I found a reason to continue

17:48.068 --> 17:49.467
and that's what
you've got to do, Ted.

17:49.469 --> 17:51.169
What reason
do I have to continue?

17:51.171 --> 17:52.336
Well...

17:53.807 --> 17:56.441
-do you like The Dubliners?
-Well...

18:00.580 --> 18:01.679
great band.

18:01.681 --> 18:04.615
I hung out with them
once back in the day.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.351
My favorite...

18:08.321 --> 18:10.655
-was Ronnie Drew.
-Yeah?

18:11.157 --> 18:15.359
Well, the tribute band is doing
a special gig here next month

18:15.361 --> 18:18.129
which, with any luck,
you'll still be around for.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.097
Oh.

18:20.567 --> 18:21.566
[chuckles]

18:24.537 --> 18:25.503
Hmm.

18:26.106 --> 18:27.138
The Dubliners.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.646
Hmm. Well, done Maximum Turtle--

18:35.648 --> 18:38.516
I'm telling you, man,
there's something going on here.

18:39.586 --> 18:41.519
There were signs of a fight
in Jerry's room

18:41.754 --> 18:44.322
and that laundry van
in the middle of the night.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.657
And now the guy's just gone.

18:47.594 --> 18:50.528
-[groans]
-Are you talking about Jerry?

18:50.530 --> 18:53.498
[pants] Yeah, man.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.234
That Jerry?

19:01.608 --> 19:04.909
[pants]

19:11.417 --> 19:13.551
Jerry? How are you, man?

19:19.792 --> 19:20.858
Uh...

19:20.860 --> 19:24.195
Where were you last night?
What happened?

19:28.601 --> 19:31.602
Madera? Oh, my God.
They got you, too?

19:32.605 --> 19:35.706
No, I'm just totally baked.
[chuckles]

19:39.746 --> 19:42.413
I'm going to annihilate you.

19:44.284 --> 19:47.585
Read this and start
with the weeping.

19:47.587 --> 19:48.653
[sighs]

19:49.322 --> 19:51.255
Why do we even let him play
with us?

19:51.257 --> 19:52.757
It should be heroes only.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.258
Come to think of it,

19:54.260 --> 19:55.877
they don't have retirement homes
for villains, do they?

19:55.878 --> 19:57.495
They're called prisons, Ray.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.730
With the information
I gave to CIA...

20:00.333 --> 20:01.866
they put away
more supervillains

20:01.868 --> 20:03.401
than all of you combined.

20:03.403 --> 20:06.771
In a way you can say that Brian
is the biggest superhero of all.

20:06.773 --> 20:09.273
-[Madera scoffs]
-Hey, what kind of a Rusky name

20:09.275 --> 20:11.976
-is Brian, anyway?
-Changed it in Deepwell.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.612
Big fan of Bryan Ferry
and Roxy Music.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.547
What was your original name?

20:17.317 --> 20:19.350
-Dmitri Shostakovich.
-[Ray] Oh, no, no.

20:19.352 --> 20:20.618
His music makes me sad

20:20.620 --> 20:24.388
but Roxy Music,
they have sexy album covers

20:24.390 --> 20:26.724
make little Brian very happy.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.327
-Ah, Jesus.
-Moving right along.

20:29.629 --> 20:33.231
Ray, what have you been doing
for the past few decades?

20:33.499 --> 20:34.699
Did you marry?

20:34.867 --> 20:38.236
Yeah, briefly and then
she wised up to me.

20:38.238 --> 20:41.372
One son, couple of grandkids
and then I retired.

20:41.541 --> 20:42.506
What about you?

20:42.508 --> 20:44.976
You never were one
for the details, were you?

20:47.280 --> 20:48.412
Me, well...

20:48.982 --> 20:51.482
I moved permanently to the US

20:51.484 --> 20:54.552
and settled down
and after I got my

20:54.554 --> 20:56.420
-Congressional Medal of Honor...
-Whoa.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.389
Just dropped that one in there.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.425
-Then my husband died.
-Sorry.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.294
So, I went to live
with my daughter

21:03.296 --> 21:05.896
until I realized
that what she wanted

21:05.898 --> 21:08.933
was a babysitter for her kids.

21:09.335 --> 21:12.570
So, I'm back in the motherland,

21:12.572 --> 21:14.272
in a home.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.607
-Okay, gentlemen...
-[Ray clears throat]

21:16.609 --> 21:17.675
...five-card draw.

21:17.677 --> 21:19.477
-Everybody in?
-Yup. Go.

21:19.612 --> 21:22.280
-[Madera] Ante up, please.
-Let's make this interesting.

21:22.282 --> 21:24.982
-I'm all in, 200.
-Raise 50.

21:27.020 --> 21:28.719
-Oh.
-Oops.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.921
-I'm out.
-I'm gone.

21:31.324 --> 21:32.423
[Windsor] Hmm.

21:33.426 --> 21:35.393
All right, I'll see you.

21:36.529 --> 21:38.763
Whoa,
you just lowered the ante, Ray.

21:38.765 --> 21:41.732
No, no, this is a first edition
action figure,

21:41.734 --> 21:44.769
collector's item,
still in the box.

21:44.771 --> 21:49.040
Don't talk massive shit of bull.
Nobody cares about you.

21:49.042 --> 21:51.709
Never mind tiny plastic version
of you.

21:52.078 --> 21:54.578
The watch. The Rolex.

21:54.881 --> 21:56.480
Well, this was a gift to me

21:56.482 --> 21:59.350
from the ambassador to France,
no less.

21:59.652 --> 22:02.753
Gave it to me for, I don't know,
some fucking reason or other.

22:04.757 --> 22:07.491
-Three of a kind.
-[exhales]

22:09.629 --> 22:12.029
-Straight. Oops.
-Oh.

22:12.031 --> 22:15.066
I guess you'll have to suck
on big Russian balls.

22:15.068 --> 22:16.600
You were using
your x-ray vision...

22:16.602 --> 22:17.868
I don't have vision powers.

22:17.870 --> 22:20.905
-You lying commie fuck--
-Guys, guys.

22:20.907 --> 22:22.073
Not the time.

22:24.344 --> 22:25.409
What?

22:25.912 --> 22:27.945
[Madera] Oh no, no.

22:28.481 --> 22:30.681
-Your friend, Jerry.
-[man] Oh no, I'm sorry.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.683
Are you kidding me?

22:33.953 --> 22:38.556
[Flynn singing indistinctly]

22:39.492 --> 22:41.859
-This is a sham, Ted.
-[Flynn singing]

22:41.994 --> 22:43.761
Where are all the world leaders?

22:43.763 --> 22:45.029
Where's the press?

22:45.031 --> 22:46.964
For Christ's sake,
Jerry stopped the moon

22:46.966 --> 22:50.401
-from colliding with the earth.
-Nice to see that Alan made it.

22:50.403 --> 22:54.438
-[howling]
-[singing indistinctly]

22:55.408 --> 22:56.941
-Poor Alan.
-He's in pieces.

22:56.943 --> 23:00.578
[howls]

23:01.114 --> 23:06.384
<i> ¶ And grace, my fears ¶</i>

23:06.386 --> 23:08.652
You saw him
after he was downwardly managed.

23:08.654 --> 23:10.121
He was a vegetable.

23:11.157 --> 23:13.157
And that was what
finished him off.

23:13.159 --> 23:14.625
Come on, Max.

23:14.627 --> 23:19.029
Residents have had their powers
downwardly managed before
and they're fine.

23:19.031 --> 23:20.598
There was nothing wrong
with him before.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.700
-Nothing.
-As the saying goes,

23:22.702 --> 23:25.436
what the caterpillar calls
the end of the world,

23:25.638 --> 23:28.672
the master calls the butterfly.

23:29.475 --> 23:32.176
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes...

23:32.779 --> 23:34.912
-dust to dust...
-It ain't right.

23:36.416 --> 23:39.683
-It ain't right.
-[church bell tolling]

23:42.088 --> 23:43.755
[man] <i>  Okay, everybody,</i>

23:43.756 --> 23:45.423
<i> -the bus is here. All aboard.</i>
-[Brian] <i> Have fun.</i>

23:45.425 --> 23:47.525
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

23:47.527 --> 23:48.959
[Alicia]
...got their hero costumes

23:48.961 --> 23:50.505
on underneath.

23:50.506 --> 23:52.050
We don't want a repeat
of last year

23:52.051 --> 23:53.595
when Ted accidentally
flashed that ten-year-old.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.933
For the hundredth time
the wind caught my towel.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.068
Alter-man!

23:58.070 --> 24:00.171
[Alicia]
That's the spirit, Bernard.

24:16.789 --> 24:17.922
Lost your way have you,

24:17.924 --> 24:18.956
-old-timer?
-What?

24:19.525 --> 24:20.558
-[chuckles]
-Oh.

24:20.560 --> 24:24.462
I-- I don't know,
I was just looking for the john

24:24.464 --> 24:25.763
or jacks or whatever.

24:25.765 --> 24:29.934
[sighs] I think I'm getting
a little confused in my old age,
you know what I mean?

24:29.936 --> 24:31.769

the short straw, Madera.

24:58.264 --> 25:00.097
We figured, because of your
prostate problem,

25:00.099 --> 25:01.765
you should be closer
to the bathroom.

25:01.767 --> 25:04.535
Oh, planning on going
in your seat again, Pendle?

25:05.705 --> 25:06.804
Nice, isn't it?

25:09.242 --> 25:10.574

-This is just the regional one.

25:57.757 --> 25:59.189
The big one is in New York.

25:59.325 --> 26:01.725
Well, thank God,
we didn't go to that one.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.328
All those cheering crowds
and groupies,

26:04.330 --> 26:05.763
that would've been a nightmare.

26:05.898 --> 26:06.897

I'm telling you,
I saw something weird

of these kids playing

Nobody else has that same power.

burning toast, Max?

28:42.988 --> 28:44.922

then jumped on the Concord,

30:34.934 --> 30:36.200
did a set in Philadelphia.

-You're totally my inspiration.
-Yeah?

Oh, wow! If there is anything
I can do to repay you,

31:19.044 --> 31:20.444
just let me know, okay?

31:20.946 --> 31:22.946
Well, you know...

31:24.016 --> 31:26.116
actually there is.

31:26.118 --> 31:28.652
Recently,
one of my best friends died

31:29.088 --> 31:31.154
and the rotten kids
in this little town,

31:31.156 --> 31:32.890
they stole his superpowers

31:32.892 --> 31:34.424
and I've told everyone about it

31:34.426 --> 31:36.526
but they think
I'm hallucinating. I'm not.

31:36.929 --> 31:39.296
I'm sharp.
I'm sharp as a tack.

31:40.466 --> 31:42.065
Okay.

31:43.035 --> 31:46.670
Well, I hope you get
to the bottom of all of that.

Hey, Flynn!
We're not fucking children.

32:12.064 --> 32:13.263
I should hope not.

32:13.265 --> 32:16.633
I-- I meant, we're not children.
You know what I mean.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.335
-Ah, never mind.

-Just do it. Do it.

33:03.248 --> 33:05.582
-I can't help it.
-Oh, it really stinks.

33:06.051 --> 33:08.285
It's like somebody took
a burning tire,

33:08.520 --> 33:10.053
stuffed it full of rotten eggs,

33:10.055 --> 33:11.989
and then shoved it up
a skunk's ass.

33:12.257 --> 33:14.491
-That's cruel.
-[pants] We got to get

33:14.493 --> 33:16.393

don't wanna lose sight of them.

33:31.777 --> 33:33.377
-[man] Yeah, you're up next.
-Roger that.

33:34.613 --> 33:38.081
Remember, when we went
up against Reactor Man?

33:38.083 --> 33:40.183

that could topple

33:40.185 --> 33:42.686
-a building with a single punch?
-[man] Yeah, come on, yo.

of the Golden Gate Bridge.

33:45.724 --> 33:47.324
-Nope.
-[indistinct chatter]

33:47.326 --> 33:49.259

then I fought back

33:49.261 --> 33:52.129
by shimmying him
under water into the bay.

33:52.131 --> 33:53.397
Then he shot out of the water,

33:53.532 --> 33:55.365
I smacked him
into that taco stand

33:55.367 --> 33:58.235
and shimmied him
right into San Quentin,

33:58.237 --> 34:00.270
lock it up, threw away the key.

34:00.272 --> 34:02.672
Well, I remember the taco stand,
yes.

34:03.375 --> 34:06.043
Typical.
The proudest moment of my career

34:06.045 --> 34:09.045
-and you remember the tacos.
-Well, I--

34:11.283 --> 34:13.250
-Oh my God, they're gone.

-Oh, and ladies.
-Careful, Grandpa.

34:48.219 --> 34:50.554
All right, that's it.
Out of the car.

34:50.722 --> 34:52.722
-Are you fucking senile, man?
-No.

34:52.724 --> 34:56.460
And I don't usually fight girls,
so you just stay cool.

34:56.594 --> 34:59.429
-You're all under arrest.

And this is my sidekick...

35:05.137 --> 35:07.404
-Actually, I'm his partner.
-...Shimmy.

35:07.773 --> 35:09.506
And we're gonna bring
you all in.

35:10.109 --> 35:11.708
Who did you nick that phone
from, Granddad?

35:11.710 --> 35:13.743
That looks like mine,
did you nick that phone from me?

35:14.413 --> 35:16.146
Are you touching me up?

35:16.147 --> 35:17.880
No, I-- Wait, wait now, come on.
We don't want any--

35:17.883 --> 35:19.382
Fucking old pervs
just touched me up.

35:19.384 --> 35:20.350
-No.
-Guys,

35:20.352 --> 35:22.402
we're just a couple of old men,
out for a walk.

35:22.403 --> 35:24.453
I don't care if you're
the fucking Jonas Brothers.

35:24.456 --> 35:25.822
My girl wants her phone back.

[man] This ain't no game.

35:31.363 --> 35:32.829
You're getting mugged,
you hear me?

35:32.830 --> 35:34.296
Now, give us your phones
and your fucking wallets...

35:34.299 --> 35:35.499
-[Ted] Max.
-...before your little bone show

35:35.501 --> 35:37.634
-gets cut up here.
-I'd give 'em, partner.

35:38.403 --> 35:39.402
No.

35:39.404 --> 35:41.638
What the fuck
did you just say to me?

35:41.640 --> 35:42.606
No.

35:42.608 --> 35:44.274
Are you having a turn old-timer?

out of you.

36:02.761 --> 36:04.694
-[car alarm blares]
-[woman] Go.

36:04.696 --> 36:06.396
[man]
Let's get the fuck out of here.

36:06.732 --> 36:07.931
[Ted] Max.

36:11.470 --> 36:14.738
-Fuck me.
-[Ted] Max, they're just kids.

36:16.341 --> 36:20.343
[Ray] Feel my fists of justice!

36:20.345 --> 36:21.444
[Ted] Max!

36:23.582 --> 36:25.215
[grunts] Hey!

36:26.752 --> 36:28.518
[Alicia] Sex rampage?

36:29.288 --> 36:31.454
-Sidekick.
-That's a bunch of crap.

36:31.456 --> 36:34.191
-You know what the most shocking
thing about this is?
-That printed papers

36:34.193 --> 36:34.958
is still a thing?

36:34.960 --> 36:37.694
That it was you two.
Two of my favorite boys.

36:37.696 --> 36:38.762
My best...

36:39.331 --> 36:41.431
Oh, Alicia, come on.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.900
Look, if it were up to me,
I'd let it go

36:43.902 --> 36:45.669
but the powers that be, they...

36:46.572 --> 36:49.306
Someone needs to be made
an example of.

36:50.375 --> 36:53.343
It was me.
The pub was my idea.

36:54.780 --> 36:56.213
No.

36:56.715 --> 36:59.516
-No, it was me.
-I thought as much.

36:59.851 --> 37:01.484
You can leave, Ted.

37:10.696 --> 37:12.495
Raymond, why?

37:15.334 --> 37:16.433
Because...

37:17.803 --> 37:18.969
I'm a hero.

37:19.638 --> 37:20.971
Don't you understand?

37:21.740 --> 37:23.440
I'm a goddamn hero.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.842
Look, the federation want
to throw you out of here

37:25.844 --> 37:27.377
-because of this.
-[sighs]

37:27.379 --> 37:28.678
I fought for you,

37:28.680 --> 37:32.449
but I'm afraid they now see
you as a public liability.

37:33.518 --> 37:34.718
Raymond, I'm sorry

37:34.953 --> 37:36.419
but they're insisting
your powers

37:36.421 --> 37:38.388
-be downwardly managed.
-[gasps]

37:46.865 --> 37:48.765
[Pendle]
What were you thinking, Ray?

37:49.368 --> 37:51.901
-I ain't afraid to die.
-[indistinct chatter]

37:52.938 --> 37:55.538
You're not gonna die.
You're gonna be fine.

37:55.540 --> 37:57.907
Oh, you mean like Jerry
was fine? [scoffs]

37:58.543 --> 38:02.045
We've been through all of this.
It was just Jerry's time.

38:02.047 --> 38:05.382
Yeah? And how about that kid
with Jerry's rainbow?

38:07.452 --> 38:09.619
Anybody see this? Any of this?

38:12.524 --> 38:14.591
[Ray] Does anyone find it
convenient that Brian

38:14.593 --> 38:16.426
wasn't out there
with us yesterday?

38:16.561 --> 38:18.495
[Pendle] Why would Brian
wanna kill Jerry?

38:19.498 --> 38:20.897
Oh, I don't know,
he's a villain.

38:20.899 --> 38:23.500
That's what villains do.
He's in on this.

38:23.502 --> 38:26.736
I buy Brian wanting to kill you,
you're an irritating man,

38:26.738 --> 38:27.937
but Jerry's harmless.

38:28.540 --> 38:31.641
Max, a man has died. I'm gonna.

38:32.077 --> 38:35.345
We're all going to.
Just let it go.

38:35.881 --> 38:38.848
Good afternoon,
I need a moment of your time.

38:39.017 --> 38:42.986
Now, I'm afraid to say,
Raymond's actions constituted

38:42.988 --> 38:46.623
a flagrant breach of the rules
and as a result,

38:46.792 --> 38:49.626
I'm under orders to assess
the ability of all of you

38:49.628 --> 38:52.095
-to control your powers.
-[all] Oh.

38:52.097 --> 38:54.397
-[man] What? No, you--
-[Alicia] I'm truly sorry but

38:54.399 --> 38:57.534
anybody unable to meet
the basic criteria

38:57.536 --> 39:01.071
will understandably have
their powers downwardly managed.

39:01.073 --> 39:02.505
-[indistinct chatter]
-[man] No.

39:02.507 --> 39:03.606
Stupid mother fu--

39:03.608 --> 39:08.044
Now, on a brighter note,
don't forget that today is

39:08.046 --> 39:09.479
-Tuna Bake Tuesday.
-[Flynn] Uh-huh.

39:09.614 --> 39:11.114
-[Alicia chuckles]
-[Flynn] Yummy.

39:11.950 --> 39:14.784
-[woman] I do like tuna.
-[indistinct chatter]

39:19.725 --> 39:21.658
[Alicia] Okay, Dolores, love.

39:21.660 --> 39:23.960
This is a simple task,
designed to gauge

39:23.962 --> 39:26.029
your level of control
over your abilities.

39:26.031 --> 39:29.599
-Well, I've never had any
complaints from the gentleman...
-Dolores...

39:29.601 --> 39:31.568
-...that I've been--
-...freeze the water, please.

39:38.009 --> 39:40.110
[Pendle clears throat]

39:40.512 --> 39:44.814
[grunts]

39:53.859 --> 39:54.858
Very good.

39:56.828 --> 39:57.927
Thank--

40:10.542 --> 40:14.878
Okay, Eagle Wings,
ready and fly!

40:14.880 --> 40:18.481
[grunts]

40:18.817 --> 40:20.917
Soar like an eagle.

40:21.887 --> 40:24.788
[screaming]

40:26.892 --> 40:28.658
[Flynn] And the eagle
has landed.

40:29.594 --> 40:33.763
Okay, Brian, and destroy
the mannequin safely.

40:33.765 --> 40:36.099
Brian not perform like a monkey
for you.

40:36.101 --> 40:38.835
In which case, you won't mind
being downwardly managed.

40:41.206 --> 40:43.873
-[growls]
-[creaking]

40:46.144 --> 40:48.445
Now, you want me to peel banana?

40:52.651 --> 40:54.117
[Dolores humming]

41:03.028 --> 41:04.994
It doesn't always work.

41:06.698 --> 41:10.667
I'm not entirely sure
what your powers are, Madera.

41:10.802 --> 41:13.703
Oh, don't worry, you can just
downwardly manage me.

41:13.705 --> 41:16.473
-That's fine.
-Thing is, we do need to know

41:16.475 --> 41:19.142
-for the form.
-I channel energy

41:19.144 --> 41:21.177
from the negative dimension
to invoke

41:21.179 --> 41:22.712
the power of the Elder Gods.

41:23.615 --> 41:26.115
Ah, gives me a bit of a headache
in the process.

41:26.585 --> 41:28.852
We do actually need to see this.

41:30.822 --> 41:32.222
[sighs]

41:50.709 --> 41:52.141
Oh, very good.

42:17.903 --> 42:19.235
[sighs]

42:20.906 --> 42:22.305
Do you have an aspirin?

42:28.880 --> 42:30.780
[Ray] Oh, oh, oh.

42:31.082 --> 42:34.217
-Hey.
-[indistinct chatter]

42:45.330 --> 42:47.297
[Brian]
There is no room for you here.

42:54.706 --> 42:55.705
Oh.

42:55.707 --> 42:58.007
So,
this is how I'm to be treated

42:58.009 --> 43:02.145
for trying to expose a cover-up
that was right under our nose.

43:02.614 --> 43:04.747
-Change the channel, Ray.
-[Brian] Nobody cares

43:04.749 --> 43:06.316
-about your delusions.
-Delusions?

43:06.318 --> 43:07.951
You know what?
You're in this, Brian.

43:07.953 --> 43:10.053
I don't know how, but somehow,
you're involved in this.

43:10.055 --> 43:11.921
Stop making this bullshit.

43:12.057 --> 43:14.057
It's because of you
we're all going to get

43:14.059 --> 43:15.892
our powers managing
to downward.

43:16.127 --> 43:18.861
And you have the big hairy balls
to call me a villain.

43:18.863 --> 43:21.164
They should stop calling you
Maximum Justice,

43:21.166 --> 43:23.766
they should call you
Maximum Hairy Balls.

43:23.768 --> 43:25.068
-[Madera] Oh.
-[Ted] Please,

43:25.070 --> 43:27.036
man's balls are as smooth
as an egg.

43:28.740 --> 43:30.907
You know what? Fuck this.

43:30.909 --> 43:32.909
-[gasping]
-[Ted] Oh, boy.

43:33.278 --> 43:35.144
What? They are.

43:35.347 --> 43:38.014
You change in and out of lycra
with the man for 30 years,

43:38.016 --> 43:38.681
you've seen it.

43:42.821 --> 43:43.987
[Flynn sighs]

43:58.169 --> 44:01.237
[man on radio] <i> Maybe, you're</i>
<i> cuddling up with a loved one</i>
<i> but if you're not,</i>

44:01.239 --> 44:03.206
<i> don't let those lonely thoughts</i>
<i> get you down.</i>

44:03.375 --> 44:05.808
<i> Coming up</i>
<i> is a little bit of Celine Dion</i>

44:05.810 --> 44:07.176
<i> with "All By Myself".</i>

44:07.178 --> 44:08.378
You got to be shitting me.

44:08.380 --> 44:11.014
[man on radio] <i>  I'm here to take</i>
<i> all you night owls to the--</i>

44:11.016 --> 44:11.981
[radio static]

44:11.983 --> 44:13.816
[woman on radio]
<i> That was "Alone" by Heart</i>

44:13.818 --> 44:16.653
<i> but now hankies</i>
<i> at the ready, for "Solitaire".</i>

44:17.322 --> 44:20.757
-Ugh, goddammit!
-I'm worried about Ray.

44:21.393 --> 44:23.159
Ted, you were his sidekick, huh?

44:23.161 --> 44:24.160
Again, partner.

44:24.162 --> 44:26.930
What I'm saying is you know
the guy.

44:26.931 --> 44:29.699
You also seem to know enough
about his egg-smooth balls.

44:29.701 --> 44:31.067
[laughs]

44:31.069 --> 44:33.102
The thing you need to know
about Max

44:33.104 --> 44:35.672
and this informs everything
that he does...

44:36.675 --> 44:40.176
-is Max is basically...
-[man on TV] <i> Ostracized</i>

44:40.178 --> 44:43.212
<i> from the pride,</i>
<i> the wounded aged male lion</i>

44:43.381 --> 44:45.948
<i> is forced to wander</i>
<i> the savanna alone</i>

44:46.217 --> 44:49.185
<i> before he finds a quiet spot</i>

44:49.320 --> 44:51.721
<i> and eventually die a lonely,</i>

44:51.723 --> 44:53.790
<i> -painful death.</i>
-Oh, come on.

44:54.159 --> 44:55.458
<i> But because of your own</i>
<i> stupidity,</i>

44:55.827 --> 44:57.393
<i> the entire castle is now dead.</i>

44:57.395 --> 44:59.862

<i> Do you understand me?</i>

44:59.864 --> 45:01.864
<i> -Your fault.</i>
<i> -Hang him!</i>

45:01.866 --> 45:05.268
<i> -Hang him!</i>
-Which is why he always smiles

45:05.270 --> 45:07.336
whenever he sees
the color mauve.

45:07.472 --> 45:10.773
But that's Max, a warrior,
a thinker

45:11.176 --> 45:13.409
and a world-class
interior decorator.

45:13.411 --> 45:14.944
The question
that has been asked,

45:14.946 --> 45:18.014
is do you think that Jerry
got his powers stolen?

45:18.016 --> 45:20.316
-Or is Ray being paranoid?
-No, I think they were stolen.

45:20.318 --> 45:21.451
Why?

45:22.020 --> 45:23.753
Well, as Einstein says,

45:23.755 --> 45:25.955
"The important thing
is to not stop questioning."

45:25.957 --> 45:29.392
The curiosity has its own reason
for existing.

45:29.394 --> 45:32.061
Ah, I see.
You're just spouting bullshit,

45:32.197 --> 45:34.464
dropping names like Einstein

45:34.466 --> 45:36.866
to cover for Ray
'cause you're his sidekick.

45:36.868 --> 45:39.802
Partner. And damn right
I'm backing him up.

45:39.804 --> 45:41.838
-It's called loyalty.
-[Pendle] Ah.

45:41.840 --> 45:44.841
[Madera] Hey, Ted, come on.
Don't go.

45:44.843 --> 45:47.810
We haven't finished taking
all your money off you yet.

45:48.146 --> 45:49.912
-[Pendle] Please, come on back.
-[all laughing]

45:49.914 --> 45:53.116
[indistinct chatter]

46:02.427 --> 46:06.095
[whistling]

46:09.267 --> 46:14.871
[door creaking]

46:19.444 --> 46:23.045
-[whistling]
-[growling]

46:26.985 --> 46:28.985
[inhales]

46:30.121 --> 46:31.387
Hello?

46:33.825 --> 46:37.460
-[Flynn whistles]
-[grunting]

46:42.834 --> 46:44.501
[button clicks]

46:44.502 --> 46:46.169
[Ted]
"Federation Detention Center."

46:53.444 --> 46:55.111
"Release of prisoner"?

46:56.214 --> 46:57.313
What?

46:58.249 --> 47:00.149
"Ability to absorb."

47:02.554 --> 47:05.555
[whistling]

47:17.135 --> 47:20.269
[sniffles, exhales]

47:23.174 --> 47:25.308
[groans] Fair enough.

47:25.877 --> 47:28.277
You're saying that someone
inside here

47:28.479 --> 47:31.180
has the power of absorption?

47:31.382 --> 47:32.381
I don't know.

47:32.383 --> 47:34.851
[Ray] Absorbing
other people's superpowers?

47:34.853 --> 47:37.220
[Ted]
I think so but I can't be sure.

47:37.222 --> 47:39.305
I had to get out of there.

47:39.306 --> 47:41.389
You mentioned a blueprint
with some sort of device?

47:41.392 --> 47:42.558
-Pendle.
-What?

47:42.560 --> 47:45.595
-It was a private conversation.
-Well, your voice carries.

47:46.197 --> 47:48.264
Okay, they are guilty.

47:48.967 --> 47:52.001
First, I see Flynn driving
the laundry van,

47:52.003 --> 47:53.903
late the night they take Jerry.

47:53.905 --> 47:55.271
[Windsor] He's a wonderful chap.

47:55.907 --> 47:58.441
Gave me blanket bath
the other night.

47:58.443 --> 48:02.211
-Such sensitive hands.
-I don't buy Flynn's a villain.

48:02.213 --> 48:04.380
Well, neither do I.
I mean, he could kill you

48:04.382 --> 48:07.416
-with kindness kumbayas.
-[Pendle] Yeah, damn right.

48:07.418 --> 48:09.352
He's more
like a Dudley goddamn Do-Right

48:09.354 --> 48:12.922
-than a criminal mastermind.
-Yeah, but, you know who isn't?

48:15.093 --> 48:16.109
Brian.

48:16.110 --> 48:17.126
And I saw him in the lobby
the other day,

48:17.128 --> 48:19.996
handing Flynn, something,
probably cash.

48:19.998 --> 48:22.632
-Where is Brian, anyway?
-[Alicia] Morning, everyone.

48:22.634 --> 48:24.567
Good news, Raymond,
your son's here.

48:26.304 --> 48:28.371
Nope, bad news, Alicia.

48:29.374 --> 48:31.540
-We're on to you.
-[indistinct chatter]

48:31.542 --> 48:33.276
You're not only
downwardly managing

48:33.278 --> 48:34.310
people's powers,

48:34.312 --> 48:37.947
-you're absorbing them.
-Goodness, me! Really?

48:37.949 --> 48:39.015
-Yes.
-Why?

48:39.017 --> 48:41.150
I-- I don't know but I--

48:41.152 --> 48:43.552
I know that Brian's definitely
involved, right, Ted?

48:44.689 --> 48:47.423
Well, you're kind of putting me
on the spot here.

48:48.493 --> 48:49.659
Maybe.

48:49.661 --> 48:53.029
So, I'm absorbing
all your powers and giving them

48:53.031 --> 48:54.297
to Brian, am I?

48:54.299 --> 48:56.232
Or some kids in the town,
we're not sure.

48:56.234 --> 48:59.702
And there are-- are blueprints
for a secret machine.

48:59.704 --> 49:01.671
Well, we don't know
if it's a secret machine,

49:01.673 --> 49:03.122
exactly.

49:03.123 --> 49:04.572
Just so I got this clear
in my head.

49:04.575 --> 49:07.443
Brian and I are taking
all your powers

49:07.445 --> 49:10.546
and giving them to some kids
in the town?

49:10.548 --> 49:13.316
-[Ray] Hmm.
-[Madera] I have to admit
it sounds less convincing

49:13.318 --> 49:16.118
-when you hear it out loud.
-And there's a machine,

49:16.120 --> 49:18.621
-which may or may not be secret.
-Damn right.

49:18.623 --> 49:20.423
And remind me,
why am I doing all this?

49:20.425 --> 49:22.124
-You tell me.
-Right, well,

49:22.126 --> 49:23.492
let me have a think
and get back to you.

49:23.695 --> 49:26.729
In the meantime, Raymond,
can I just say that,

49:27.131 --> 49:30.466
I'm hearing a lot of anger
and frustration from you

49:30.468 --> 49:32.702
and I think
you're bottling it up inside,

49:32.704 --> 49:36.272
and I just want you to know
that I'm here for you

49:36.274 --> 49:37.673
-whenever you want to talk.
-[Ray] Oh.

49:37.675 --> 49:40.710
Well, I do have two words
for you right now.

49:41.145 --> 49:43.212
The first word begins with "F"

49:43.214 --> 49:46.415
and the second one ends
with "uck off"!

49:46.417 --> 49:48.451
Again, lot of anger.

49:48.619 --> 49:51.020
Meantime,
you're son's still waiting

49:51.022 --> 49:53.723
-in the visitors room. Boop.
-[Pendle laughs]

49:53.725 --> 49:57.193
-[sighs]
-Mike, I'm telling you,

49:57.528 --> 49:59.328
they're stealing our powers.

49:59.330 --> 50:01.063
-They're absorbing them.
-[Michael] Yeah, Dad,

50:01.065 --> 50:02.498
can I talk to you
about something

50:02.500 --> 50:03.766
that actually happened?

50:04.268 --> 50:06.335
What?
You think I'm going senile?

50:06.471 --> 50:09.205
-I'm dementia-ridden?
-I didn't get the job, Dad.

50:10.041 --> 50:11.324
You're kidding.

50:11.325 --> 50:12.608
Nope,
they gave it to an Irish guy.

50:12.777 --> 50:15.311
Oh, those racists,
sons of bitches!

50:15.313 --> 50:16.746
Dad, we're in Ireland.

50:18.249 --> 50:20.416
Can we-- You're gonna get
another job here, right?

50:20.418 --> 50:21.717
Not as an American.

50:21.719 --> 50:23.652
Yeah, I can't move
the whole family over here

50:23.654 --> 50:25.121
if I don't have a job.

50:28.126 --> 50:30.159
So, that's it? That's it.

50:30.695 --> 50:32.728
Occasional visits
every couple of years.

50:32.730 --> 50:35.197
Well, fair enough. I guess
I wasn't around much either

50:35.199 --> 50:37.199
-when you were a kid.
-Don't give me the lone wolf

50:37.201 --> 50:38.601
cape crusader bullshit.

50:38.736 --> 50:40.536
And all this conspiracy stuff,

50:40.671 --> 50:41.804
it's gotta stop.

50:41.806 --> 50:44.473
I mean, what do you need
your powers for now anyway,

50:44.475 --> 50:46.375
to beat up a bunch
of local kids?

50:46.377 --> 50:49.111
All I want you to do is put
your feet up

50:49.113 --> 50:51.680
and enjoy your retirement
in this beautiful country,

50:51.682 --> 50:55.117
this beautiful house,
with all your old friends.

50:57.622 --> 51:00.156
[sighs]

51:01.159 --> 51:02.258
Yup.

51:08.433 --> 51:09.498
It's gone.

51:10.068 --> 51:11.534
All the evidence is gone.

51:12.203 --> 51:13.836
-What are you talking about?
-I just snuck back

51:13.838 --> 51:15.604
into the administration office

51:15.606 --> 51:17.606
and all that stuff I saw
about absorption,

51:17.608 --> 51:19.108
it's disappeared.

51:19.277 --> 51:21.510
So, the stuff
you weren't entirely sure

51:21.512 --> 51:24.647
about before,
now you have no evidence of it,

51:24.649 --> 51:26.382
-whatsoever.
-Just think about it, will you?

51:26.384 --> 51:28.684
If these people
have nothing to hide,

51:28.686 --> 51:30.719
then why has someone
just hidden it?

51:31.155 --> 51:34.323
[Brian] Cheer up, people.
Who died? [laughing]

51:35.660 --> 51:37.326
Brian late for lunch?

51:37.528 --> 51:39.395
Crazy big bowel movement.

51:40.531 --> 51:42.665
-Now moving right along.
-[Brian grunts]

51:42.667 --> 51:45.201
Max says he saw you
giving money to Flynn.

51:45.203 --> 51:47.436
Are you trading
in stolen superpowers?

51:47.872 --> 51:49.538
I don't know
what you're talking about.

51:49.540 --> 51:51.307
Ugh,
so you didn't give Flynn money?

51:51.309 --> 51:52.608
Yes, uh...

51:53.578 --> 51:55.411
-gambling debt.
-No, no, no,

51:55.413 --> 51:57.580
that mama's boy,
he does not gamble.

51:57.582 --> 52:00.149
If it wasn't a gambling debt,
Brian, what was it?

52:01.853 --> 52:03.452
I'd rather not say.

52:03.454 --> 52:05.387
So, you are stealing
superpowers.

52:05.389 --> 52:07.556
No! When Brian commit crime,

52:07.692 --> 52:10.226
-he'll not do it in the shadows.
-He does appear, however,

52:10.228 --> 52:11.427
to do it in the third person.

52:11.429 --> 52:14.463
-The truth, Brian, now.
-You threaten Brian?

52:14.465 --> 52:17.266
-Sorry, me?
-Spit it out, Brian.

52:17.268 --> 52:19.668
Why were you paying off Flynn?

52:21.305 --> 52:23.906
Fine. It's Viagra.

52:24.242 --> 52:27.309
Yes, a big joke, laugh.
Brian get a floppy cock.

52:27.311 --> 52:29.912
But Viagra make him rock hard
like a submarine.

52:30.314 --> 52:31.680
[Alicia]
Through there is the day lounge.

52:31.682 --> 52:34.250
And Flynn is a good man.
He tried to help me.

52:34.252 --> 52:36.785
He sold stolen powers
to those kids.

52:36.787 --> 52:38.787
Sorry, could you just excuse me
one second?

52:38.789 --> 52:41.423
[woman] Oh sure, no problem.
Let's just go...

52:41.425 --> 52:44.627
Hey, Madera,
Brian take a pill this morning,

52:44.629 --> 52:47.429
you wanna play
<i> Hunt for Red October?</i>

52:49.600 --> 52:51.050
No.

52:51.051 --> 52:52.501
I wanna find out
what's going on here.

52:52.503 --> 52:54.637
-Let's go find Flynn.
-[Pendle] Let's see
what we can find

52:54.639 --> 52:57.306
on the security monitors
besides Griffin's drool.

53:05.950 --> 53:08.651
[groans]

53:21.299 --> 53:23.632
[knocking on door]

53:24.202 --> 53:26.936
-Yeah.
-[door opens]

53:28.339 --> 53:29.672
-Flynn?
-Hey, Ray.

53:29.907 --> 53:31.640
Ready for the old procedure?

53:34.278 --> 53:36.645
Sure. Downwardly manage away.

53:41.519 --> 53:44.486
-In the clinic, right?
-Yeah. Yeah.

53:45.590 --> 53:49.892
Something like that. [whistles]

53:51.662 --> 53:53.596
-[Pendle] Griffin?
-[Griffin singing]

53:53.731 --> 53:57.600
-Griffin?
-[Griffin sings]

53:57.835 --> 53:59.768
[Griffin] ¶<i> And say goodbye ¶</i>

54:00.371 --> 54:01.337
Griffin?

54:02.373 --> 54:03.639
What the hell?

54:06.244 --> 54:07.743
[Griffin] Hi.

54:08.279 --> 54:10.512
I'm really high.

54:10.514 --> 54:11.747
[Pendle]
Hey, Griffin, come down.

54:12.583 --> 54:14.850
-Come on, Griff.
-[sniffles, groans]

54:15.953 --> 54:18.520
Hey, wake up.
Wake up now.

54:18.756 --> 54:20.289
I'm the man.

54:21.726 --> 54:24.393
Wow. My man.

54:24.695 --> 54:26.428
Am I dreaming you?

54:26.831 --> 54:29.431
How are you doing that?

54:29.900 --> 54:32.434
Does what it says on the tin.

54:32.737 --> 54:34.703
Griffin, where did you get this?

54:34.705 --> 54:37.573
I got it from the kids
at the youth club, yeah.

54:37.575 --> 54:40.809
Someone is trying to sell
our superpowers

54:40.811 --> 54:42.311
like drugs.

54:42.947 --> 54:45.514
I'm flat out Lionel Richie.

54:45.716 --> 54:47.283
-What?
-I'm dancing

54:47.285 --> 54:49.418
on the fucking ceiling, man.

54:49.687 --> 54:51.137
-True fact...
-Mm-hmm.

54:51.138 --> 54:52.588
...the video
for "Dancing on the Ceiling"

54:52.590 --> 54:54.323
was actually filmed
on three sets,

54:54.325 --> 54:56.692
one, right side up,
one, upside down,

54:56.694 --> 54:59.962
and the other on a device known
as a rotating gimbal.

54:59.964 --> 55:02.364
Oh, is there any way you
can extract those powers to keep

55:02.366 --> 55:03.599
from boring the shit out of me?

55:03.601 --> 55:06.702
[Windsor] Hey,
Ray's got a wheelchair, too.

55:07.972 --> 55:09.071
Oh.

55:10.041 --> 55:12.574
Hey, we gotta help him, fast.

55:13.077 --> 55:16.345
-Pendle.
-[Pendle] Okay. [grunts]

55:16.347 --> 55:18.380
Come on, Pendle.

55:18.382 --> 55:21.350
Oh, Raymond, I'm really glad
you've seen sense

55:21.352 --> 55:23.319
about the whole
downwardly managing thing.

55:23.321 --> 55:24.553
[Ray] I'm ready, Alicia.

55:24.555 --> 55:27.623
I'm really ready to start
enjoying my retirement.

55:27.892 --> 55:30.993
You know, it's like you said,
I've got all this anger

55:30.995 --> 55:32.795
bottled up inside and...

55:33.798 --> 55:35.764
-and I don't talk to anybody.
-Yeah, that's fantastic,

55:35.766 --> 55:37.966
Raymond, can I just borrow Flynn
for a second?

55:38.769 --> 55:41.470
It all stems back to my dad.

55:41.472 --> 55:43.072
Flynn, what the hell
have you been doing?

55:43.074 --> 55:44.773
I brought you here
because you could help me

55:44.775 --> 55:46.575
absorb superpowers,
not flaunt them

55:46.577 --> 55:48.677
to the inbred teenagers
in the town.

55:48.846 --> 55:50.913
Do you have any idea
how many strings I had to pull

55:50.915 --> 55:53.615
with the federation
to get you out of prison
and this is how you repay me?

55:53.617 --> 55:55.784
...cut the toast
into triangles...

55:55.786 --> 55:57.920
I just wanted to make
a bit of extra coin on the side,

55:57.922 --> 55:59.388
-you know?
-A bit of extra coin?

55:59.390 --> 56:01.523
You gave them
Jerry's superpowers, you idiot.

56:01.525 --> 56:02.591
Only a tiny dose.

56:02.593 --> 56:04.844
It's so small, it wears off
after a couple of minutes.

56:04.845 --> 56:07.096
If you must know, I cut it
with a can of Dr. Pepper.

56:07.098 --> 56:09.031
...just eat the eggs, Ray-Ray.

56:10.434 --> 56:12.134
I need you to go to town...

56:13.404 --> 56:15.871
pull your finger out
from wherever it is jammed

56:15.873 --> 56:18.440
and stop this whole plan
from unraveling.

56:19.610 --> 56:21.810
...fried, poached,
sunny side up,

56:21.946 --> 56:23.879
all of 'em,
like knives to my heart.

56:23.881 --> 56:25.647
What the fuck you talking about,
man?

56:25.649 --> 56:26.915
[Alicia] I own you, Flynn,

56:27.451 --> 56:29.752
don't ever forget that.

56:31.389 --> 56:34.656
-[Pendle] I got you, Raymundo.
-Now, Raymond, where were we?

56:39.530 --> 56:40.696
[Madera] Step on it, damn it.

56:42.133 --> 56:43.832
Oh, Ray. Thank God.

56:43.834 --> 56:46.802
I just wanna say, I know
that we all doubted you but--

56:46.804 --> 56:48.103
Hey, it's Flynn.

56:51.842 --> 56:53.142
We gotta get after him.

56:53.144 --> 56:55.677
Hey, weren't we halfway
through an apology here?

56:55.679 --> 56:56.645
[Ted] Listen...

56:57.081 --> 56:58.447
good luck, guys.

56:58.849 --> 57:01.550
-Wait, you're not coming, Ted?
-No, uh...

57:02.486 --> 57:04.186
my sidekick days are done.

57:04.188 --> 57:06.588
-Oh.
-Come on, Ted.

57:07.024 --> 57:09.124
I mean, we're on the trail
of bad guys here.

57:09.126 --> 57:10.826
The clock's ticking.

57:10.828 --> 57:12.561
What the hell is wrong with you?

57:12.563 --> 57:14.963
Cancer. It's aggressive.

57:15.633 --> 57:18.066
I got a couple of months,
if I'm lucky.

57:18.836 --> 57:20.569
-[Madera] Shit.
-Yeah.

57:20.905 --> 57:23.872
-Fuck.
-Oh, my giddy aunt.

57:24.074 --> 57:27.609
-Jesus, Ted, I'm so sorry.
-Yeah.

57:28.212 --> 57:29.478
[Ray] Damn it.

57:31.715 --> 57:33.682
Well, I guess it's a fact that,

57:34.218 --> 57:35.918
we're all on our way out.

57:36.954 --> 57:39.555
And we're all getting
that superpower

57:39.557 --> 57:41.857
that all people get
facing old age,

57:42.526 --> 57:43.792
invisibility.

57:44.628 --> 57:46.795
Where people look
right through you...

57:47.865 --> 57:49.531
then they see nothing.

57:51.502 --> 57:52.634
But I ain't nothing...

57:53.704 --> 57:54.903
and you ain't nothing.

57:56.774 --> 57:58.941
I need you, Ted, I do.

58:04.515 --> 58:06.014
-So, what are we waiting for?
-[Pendle] Yeah.

58:06.016 --> 58:07.549
-Yeah.
-All right.

58:07.551 --> 58:10.919
-Feel my Fist of Shimmy.
-[indistinct chatter]

58:11.655 --> 58:14.857
-[Pendle] Yeah!
-[Ray] Feel my Fist...

58:14.859 --> 58:16.191
This doesn't work
unless you take your--

58:16.193 --> 58:17.626
-[Pendle] Wait a minute.
-Each person

58:17.628 --> 58:19.728
-does their own thing.
-[Pendle] Look,
then you go first, now.

58:19.729 --> 58:21.829
-Bring the heat.
-[Madera] No, no, no.

58:30.708 --> 58:31.807
[Ray grunts]

58:36.013 --> 58:37.145
[grunts]

58:47.525 --> 58:48.991
[grunts] It's getting caught.

59:05.242 --> 59:06.842
Justice is served.

59:27.264 --> 59:28.664
[owl hooting]

59:31.936 --> 59:33.001
[owl squealing]

59:33.003 --> 59:37.940
Is it just me or is this place
weirdly anti-owl?

59:38.342 --> 59:40.709
[Madera groans] Let's get help.

59:40.878 --> 59:42.311
[Gwyneth]
Oh, that's a tricky piece.

59:42.313 --> 59:45.247
[woman] Well, just turn it,
you know,
you just push it in, it'll...

59:46.750 --> 59:48.951
-Are you God?
-But he's black.

59:48.953 --> 59:50.352
Oh, come on, Gwyneth.

59:50.354 --> 59:52.588
Where is it written that God
has to be white?

59:52.590 --> 59:54.856
Well, I just meant to say
and he's black.

59:54.858 --> 59:56.692
Yeah, but honestly,
why would you even bring up

59:56.694 --> 59:59.861
-the color of the skin.
-Ladies? Ladies? Ladies?

01:00:00.197 --> 01:00:01.330
What you're doing now,

01:00:01.899 --> 01:00:03.732
I need that.

01:00:04.301 --> 01:00:05.601
[Ted] Bernard.

01:00:07.037 --> 01:00:09.171
Bernard, we need your help.

01:00:11.909 --> 01:00:14.743
Alter-man.

01:00:14.745 --> 01:00:16.845
[Ted]
Preferably with your pants on.

01:00:21.352 --> 01:00:23.218
-Whoa.
-[moaning]

01:00:24.054 --> 01:00:26.188
-Brian.
-Brian take Viagra.

01:00:26.757 --> 01:00:28.991
He used to put <i> Red October</i>
in dry dock.

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:30.993
[Dolores] Less of the dry,
you cheeky bugger.

01:00:30.995 --> 01:00:32.394
No, no, just expression.

01:00:32.396 --> 01:00:34.763
-My beautiful, sexy, goddess.
-Oh, come on, you guys,

01:00:34.765 --> 01:00:36.765
we need you to help us
get out of here.

01:00:36.767 --> 01:00:38.667
-Time to suit up.
-Absolutely.

01:00:38.836 --> 01:00:41.036
-In six hours.
-No, Brian, now.

01:00:41.038 --> 01:00:44.006
You want me to put on tights
before Viagra wears off?

01:00:44.174 --> 01:00:45.173
It's not good look.

01:00:45.175 --> 01:00:47.409
I want you to hack
into their computers,

01:00:47.411 --> 01:00:48.910
you're Russian, aren't you?

01:00:48.912 --> 01:00:51.313
Oh, once I find cushion for lap.

01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:56.218
[alarm blaring]

01:00:56.754 --> 01:00:58.387
[man] Hey, come on.

01:01:02.226 --> 01:01:05.293
Hey, is this a taser
in a care home?

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:14.870
-Alter-man.
-[alarm blaring]

01:01:25.883 --> 01:01:27.215
Windsor, you read.

01:01:27.718 --> 01:01:30.452
Brian find Latin alphabet
hurts his head.

01:01:31.088 --> 01:01:34.189
-[Windsor sighs]
-[computer beeps]

01:01:34.992 --> 01:01:37.693
[Windsor]
Deactivate security system.

01:01:37.961 --> 01:01:39.895
Yes, no.

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:43.098
-[computer beeps]
-Enter password.

01:01:45.269 --> 01:01:47.903
[Griffin] What are you guys
doing in my dream?

01:01:48.872 --> 01:01:51.973
-[Brian] Hey. [mumbles]
-[Griffin] Too aggressive.

01:01:52.176 --> 01:01:55.010
You need to relax, man, yeah?

01:01:55.012 --> 01:01:58.380
-[alarm blaring]
-[over PA] <i>  Security violation.</i>

01:01:58.382 --> 01:01:59.832

-[Griffin] I got this shit.

01:02:11.328 --> 01:02:14.096
Come on.
That's right, that's, that's...

01:02:15.199 --> 01:02:16.298
Let's do it again.

01:02:17.167 --> 01:02:18.800
Start again, everybody.

01:02:18.936 --> 01:02:21.236
-Go, go, go, go.
-Max! Max!

01:02:22.506 --> 01:02:24.339
Jesus, this place
isn't about keeping

01:02:24.341 --> 01:02:26.408
the bad guys out,
it's about keeping us in.

01:02:28.312 --> 01:02:30.479
-[computer beeps]
-[Brian] Time elapsed, man.

01:02:31.281 --> 01:02:32.414
What time?

01:02:32.416 --> 01:02:34.816

Forty a day for twenty years,
guys. [coughs]

01:02:55.506 --> 01:02:58.440
Bad lifestyle choices. [gasps]

01:02:59.343 --> 01:03:02.010
-It's not holding.
-Let's get out of here.

01:03:02.012 --> 01:03:03.345
-Run!
-[Ray] Run!

01:03:03.347 --> 01:03:05.313
[man over speaker]
<i> Step away from the gate.</i>

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:09.317
[Pendle] Hurry, Madera, hurry.

01:03:09.319 --> 01:03:11.153
-[Ray] Are you okay?
-[Madera] I'm okay.

01:03:11.155 --> 01:03:13.005
-[Ray] Madera?
-[Madera] I'm fine.

01:03:13.006 --> 01:03:14.856
-We got to cross the moat.
-[alarm blaring]

01:03:15.192 --> 01:03:17.526
Oh, shit. The moat.

01:03:17.861 --> 01:03:19.194
[woman]
Alicia, can we have a word?

01:03:19.196 --> 01:03:22.297
Yeah, we were thinking
it'd be a really good idea
if we could have a spelling bee.

01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:23.431
Sorry, ladies, I can't, really.

01:03:23.433 --> 01:03:25.267
No, no, a spelling bee's
a great idea 'cause we're older

01:03:25.268 --> 01:03:27.102
and we have to think
about things

01:03:27.104 --> 01:03:29.504
and we have to remember words
and get numbers, you know...

01:03:30.374 --> 01:03:32.908
[water bubbling]

01:03:38.048 --> 01:03:39.548
That's pure peritoneum.

01:03:40.117 --> 01:03:42.884
-Death for any superhero.
-[Madera] Oh, boy.

01:03:43.153 --> 01:03:44.853
[Dolores] All but one.

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:47.222
Dolores.

01:03:48.859 --> 01:03:51.426
I'm not just a sex object,
you know?

01:03:52.563 --> 01:03:54.296
[Ray] Dolores, don't.

01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:04.005
-By the forces of Promiscua.
-[grunts]

01:04:04.908 --> 01:04:06.508
Promiscua is a place.

01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:15.350
[hums]

01:04:23.126 --> 01:04:24.626
I don't even have a phone,
so if it'd be--

01:04:24.628 --> 01:04:26.862
-It'd burn if I did, though.
-It doesn't have to be

01:04:26.864 --> 01:04:28.864
a spelling bee.
We could play Texas Hold 'Em.

01:04:28.866 --> 01:04:30.031
-[gasps] All in!
-All in!

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:32.033
-Ladies, get out of my way.
-Oh, oh, oh.

01:04:32.035 --> 01:04:35.003
I was hoping for a spelling bee.
I just shaved my legs.

01:04:36.306 --> 01:04:38.607
-You be all right, Dolores?
-Yes.

01:04:39.142 --> 01:04:41.209
It does drain my sex drive,
though.

01:04:42.012 --> 01:04:44.479
I'm usually frigid
from the waist down.

01:04:46.116 --> 01:04:49.451
[pants]

01:04:52.256 --> 01:04:53.455
What now?

01:04:54.658 --> 01:04:55.657
Uber?

01:04:57.427 --> 01:05:00.295
[man] Take the Thomond Bridge
over the River Shannon.

01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:04.065
Your boy is likely
to be over the fuckin' Ganges.

01:05:04.368 --> 01:05:06.601
He's on his Apple Maps
on his iPhone

01:05:06.603 --> 01:05:08.570
and he's insisting
there's a motorway

01:05:08.572 --> 01:05:10.138
between Cork and Limerick.

01:05:10.307 --> 01:05:13.008
So, I says to him,
"You are no fucking driver,

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:15.277
now, sit in the back,
talking shite."

01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:18.546
And he's like,
"Shoulda got an Uber."
And I'm like, "Uber."

01:05:18.548 --> 01:05:21.283
-You're sitting on my cape.
-[driver] Don't get me started
on the license...

01:05:21.285 --> 01:05:22.517
You're cramping my style.

01:05:22.519 --> 01:05:24.386

-I don't give a rat's arse.

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:31.326
-Yup--
-[Alicia] <i> Listen carefully.</i>

01:05:31.561 --> 01:05:34.229
Ray and his little pack
of cronies have broken out.

01:05:34.231 --> 01:05:36.364
So, we're bringing the plan
forward to tonight.

01:05:36.366 --> 01:05:38.466
Meet me at the lab
as soon as you can, now.

01:05:41.371 --> 01:05:44.039
-Can I cancel my order, please?
-[man] <i>  What's that?</i>

01:05:44.675 --> 01:05:48.243
<i> You say something?</i>
<i> Sorry, I had me headphones in.</i>

01:05:54.251 --> 01:05:55.717
-Keep the change.
-Oh.

01:05:55.719 --> 01:05:56.985
-[groaning]
-Good luck

01:05:56.987 --> 01:05:58.203
with the clowning now.

01:05:58.204 --> 01:05:59.420
You're sure to have
the kiddies laugh

01:05:59.423 --> 01:06:00.555
their little back sides off.

-Evening, scumbags.
-[all laughing]

01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:27.449
You.

01:06:28.285 --> 01:06:30.685
-[woman 1] Ooh.
-[woman 2] Ooh.

01:06:33.423 --> 01:06:35.690
Look, old man,
you want everyone to see

01:06:35.692 --> 01:06:37.559
you beaten senseless, huh?

01:06:38.128 --> 01:06:39.227
Don't be stupid.

01:06:39.229 --> 01:06:42.197
Take the freak show and you go
back home to bed, yeah?

01:06:42.399 --> 01:06:43.732
Before you get hurt.

01:06:47.137 --> 01:06:49.604
I notice the eight ball
is still remaining.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.673
Now that's a tough hole to make.

01:06:52.142 --> 01:06:56.044
You must have one hell of a shot
up your sleeve to pull that off.

01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:57.178
How is that?

01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:59.647
Because I've never seen anyone
make that shot

01:06:59.649 --> 01:07:02.283
with a cue stick stuck up
their ass.

01:08:11.321 --> 01:08:12.420
[Madera] Hey.

01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:15.824
Some people would pay good money
for this view, you know.

01:08:15.826 --> 01:08:18.626
I wouldn't give you two euro,
you skanky--

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:21.462
Okay, one more time,

01:08:21.465 --> 01:08:24.566
-where did you get this?
-[grunts]

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:26.801
No.

01:08:26.803 --> 01:08:29.304
I'm not saying nothing
to no one about nothing.

01:08:29.305 --> 01:08:30.805
Is anyone else completely lost

01:08:30.807 --> 01:08:32.640
with all the double negatives
there?

01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:35.510
Let me try
and get some sense from him.

01:08:36.145 --> 01:08:38.279
[pants] Get away from me,
you freaky bitch.

01:08:38.782 --> 01:08:42.817
How about you spend some time
on the naughty step

01:08:42.819 --> 01:08:47.188

[Madera] Now, let's try again.

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:59.399
Who gave you the vials
and where are they now?

01:09:00.904 --> 01:09:02.170
Flynn.

01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:04.272
It was Flynn.

01:09:04.674 --> 01:09:06.640
Dudley Do-Right son of a bitch.

01:09:07.210 --> 01:09:08.343
[Ray] Where is he?

01:09:08.745 --> 01:09:10.145
Knacker's yard.

01:09:10.881 --> 01:09:12.647
He is gone
to the knacker's yard.

01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:15.250
Something big
is happening tonight.

01:09:20.223 --> 01:09:22.223
-[Ted] Take the curve slower.
-[Pendle] Every time you hit

01:09:22.225 --> 01:09:23.791
a bump,
I'm like a 70s waterbed.

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:25.627
-[Ray] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-[Ted] He said left

01:09:25.629 --> 01:09:27.962
-after the roundabout.
-[Ray] What the fuck
is a roundabout?

01:09:27.964 --> 01:09:30.298
-[Ted] It's a system they use
for traffic control.
-[Madera] There, this left.

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:31.499
[Ted]
It's very efficient.

01:09:33.837 --> 01:09:36.504
Wait, he said the knacker's yard
was the second left.

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:39.407
-And this is the second left.
-I thought he said right.

01:09:40.577 --> 01:09:41.743
Ah, Jesus.

01:09:48.251 --> 01:09:50.618
Hey, was it the first
or second left?

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:53.388
Second left, the knacker's yard.

01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:54.522
We're outside of Dunmanor.

01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:56.724
Exactly, the knacker's yard.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.394
Is that what you call
an old folk's home,

01:09:59.396 --> 01:10:00.762
-you son of a bitch?
-Well...

01:10:01.364 --> 01:10:03.264
yous are all knackered,
ain't yous?

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:10.638
[door beeps]

01:10:10.874 --> 01:10:12.574
Looks like a trap to me.

01:10:14.277 --> 01:10:15.243
Fuck it.

01:10:15.245 --> 01:10:17.879
We broke out, we may as well
stroll right back in.

01:10:17.881 --> 01:10:20.315
Hey, what about me?

01:10:22.519 --> 01:10:23.518
[screams]

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:25.920

You're all fucking knackers.

01:10:34.831 --> 01:10:38.866
[owl hooting]

01:10:47.611 --> 01:10:49.310
Where is everybody?

01:10:51.548 --> 01:10:53.281
[groaning]

01:10:53.717 --> 01:10:55.316
Sounds coming from there.

01:10:55.318 --> 01:10:57.452
-They're in the spa?
-[Pendle] No, spa's in refurb.

01:10:57.454 --> 01:10:59.554
-It's been closed for a week.
-Madera] They've closed the spa?

01:10:59.556 --> 01:11:00.755
-[Pendle] Yeah.
-I didn't know that.

01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:02.023
[Pendle]
It's been in the newsletter.

01:11:02.025 --> 01:11:04.692
-I've been trying to tell you.
-All right, guys, listen up.

01:11:04.694 --> 01:11:07.962
Whatever is beyond those doors,
we have to hit them hard

01:11:07.964 --> 01:11:09.597
and we have to hit them fast.

01:11:10.433 --> 01:11:11.432
Ready?

01:11:12.335 --> 01:11:15.403
Three, two, one.

01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:18.339
Save your strength, honey.
Mm-hmm.

01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:20.642
[woman gasping]

01:11:25.915 --> 01:11:28.383
[Ray] Okay, guys,
whatever is beyond these doors,

01:11:28.385 --> 01:11:29.484
-we need to--
-[Pendle] Ray,

01:11:29.486 --> 01:11:31.753
-you said that before.
-[door creaks]

01:11:34.791 --> 01:11:37.892
[Alicia]
And look, the gang's all here.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:46.467
I don't think they're just
getting a steam, do you?

01:11:48.305 --> 01:11:50.004
Brian, Brian.

01:11:50.974 --> 01:11:52.307
What happened?

01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:54.609
There was a massive fight,

01:11:54.611 --> 01:11:59.047
-Brian kicked a lot of assholes.
-[Ray] Uh-huh.

01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:01.949
[Alicia]
We spiked his Earl Gray.

01:12:01.951 --> 01:12:03.785
Same with the rest
of the old farts.

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:05.920
I don't get the master plan,
Alicia.

01:12:06.423 --> 01:12:07.555
I do.

01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:10.992
It's Flynn.

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:12.493
The absorbing
former super jailbird.

01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:15.563
Yup, and I'm taking his power.

01:12:15.765 --> 01:12:16.998
Cool device, eh?

01:12:18.068 --> 01:12:19.434
All my own work.

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:22.737
You lying cow.
I was downwardly managed,

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:24.772
but you never said

01:12:24.774 --> 01:12:26.808
you were taking
my super cells. [gasps]

01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:29.911
And five, four,

01:12:29.913 --> 01:12:32.980
three, two, one.

01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:35.583
[pants]

01:12:35.819 --> 01:12:37.418
[nurse 1] This is getting
way too heavy

01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:38.987
for a sea horse contract.

01:12:38.988 --> 01:12:40.555
-[nurse 2] Too fuckin' right.
-[nurse 1] Let's go.

01:12:40.557 --> 01:12:42.590
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Alicia] Go, I don't need you.

01:12:42.592 --> 01:12:43.791
I don't need any of you.

01:12:43.927 --> 01:12:45.693
Now there's been a change
of plan.

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:47.061
Why, Alicia?

01:12:47.063 --> 01:12:48.763
[Alicia] The problem
with all you superheroes

01:12:48.765 --> 01:12:52.100
is the wrong sorts
always ended up with the powers.

01:12:52.602 --> 01:12:53.868
Just look at you all.

01:12:54.037 --> 01:12:57.438
No one would miss
a few old people's powers.

01:12:57.841 --> 01:13:02.009
I'm going to create
a perfect super-being.

01:13:02.512 --> 01:13:05.580
I'm going to add
all your power cells

01:13:05.782 --> 01:13:07.715
to my youthful eggs,

01:13:08.118 --> 01:13:12.787
to mother the one
that will defeat all others.

01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:15.990
You are gonna create
this super-being and kill

01:13:15.992 --> 01:13:16.991
all these good folks?

01:13:16.993 --> 01:13:19.761
-Like Jerry, huh?
-Jerry was a mistake.

01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:22.764
But now I've perfected
the process,

01:13:22.766 --> 01:13:25.166
so these people won't die.
Not that they deserve to live.

01:13:25.502 --> 01:13:29.771
I'm so sick of all you
tormented superheroes

01:13:29.773 --> 01:13:32.073
with all your darkness
and your demons

01:13:32.075 --> 01:13:33.975
and there's so fucking many
of you.

01:13:34.611 --> 01:13:36.677
Captain this, Super that,

01:13:36.679 --> 01:13:40.581
Doctor who-gives-a-shit.
Hello, it's a crowded market.

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:44.419
All the world needs
is one superhero.

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:46.888
Preferably one Maximum Justice,

01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:49.023
who isn't going to knock over
a building

01:13:49.025 --> 01:13:50.758
that killed my parents.

01:13:51.861 --> 01:13:54.095
Your parents
were in the Tower Block

01:13:54.097 --> 01:13:56.564
-that fell in Brussels?
-No.

01:13:56.699 --> 01:13:58.833
Well,
not the skyscraper in Tokyo?

01:13:59.102 --> 01:14:00.134
Guess again.

01:14:01.971 --> 01:14:04.639
The tenement building
in New York City

01:14:04.641 --> 01:14:08.576
that collapsed
when I captured Dr. Left Eye.

01:14:11.147 --> 01:14:13.080
-Sorry, I...
-Too late, Ray.

01:14:13.082 --> 01:14:16.184
-You're all about to join them.
-[Madera] Alicia.

01:14:21.090 --> 01:14:23.791

01:14:26.563 --> 01:14:29.931
[grunting]

01:14:43.112 --> 01:14:44.111
Ted?

01:14:47.851 --> 01:14:51.752
Sorry, I kind of stole
his powers and unfortunately,

01:14:51.754 --> 01:14:52.854
-his smell.
-Ugh.

01:14:52.856 --> 01:14:56.224
Well, it's time to wake up
and smell the justice.

01:14:58.127 --> 01:15:00.094
[grunts]

01:15:10.874 --> 01:15:12.006
No.

01:15:13.877 --> 01:15:15.009
[Madera] Stop.

01:15:19.849 --> 01:15:21.182
Get up, Ray.

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:22.984
Get up.

01:15:27.957 --> 01:15:31.926
[screams]

01:15:31.928 --> 01:15:36.931
Ow, ow, oh! Ugh! Ugh!

01:15:38.167 --> 01:15:40.268
-Bitch.
-[Alicia] No, you're a bitch.

01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:43.971
[Madera]
That was my hip, bitch. [grunts]

01:15:45.742 --> 01:15:48.209
My elbow. Ow, my tits.

01:15:51.681 --> 01:15:54.148
-[grunts]
-[Alicia] Now, Madera, I'm--

01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:56.150
[Ray] Alicia, you look tired.

01:15:56.619 --> 01:15:57.919
Why don't you take a seat?

01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:02.890
[Alicia] Don't waste
your breath, old man.

01:16:04.327 --> 01:16:07.161
I'll absorb your very soul.

01:16:07.297 --> 01:16:09.063
No.

01:16:28.985 --> 01:16:32.720
Let go, Ray. Hmm, easy now.

01:16:34.324 --> 01:16:35.356
Give it up.

01:16:35.358 --> 01:16:38.192
He ain't giving up nothing
to nobody, sister.

01:16:38.695 --> 01:16:40.261
Oh, it's the other one.

01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:41.828
Thunder Thighs, Black Lace,
whatever.

01:16:41.831 --> 01:16:44.732
The name is Total Thunder.

01:16:45.168 --> 01:16:47.068
And I'm gonna put you under.

01:16:48.304 --> 01:16:50.905
Put you under, what is that,
an anesthetic thing?

01:16:51.207 --> 01:16:54.308
-Oh, it's when you bury...
-Well, if it needs explaining.

01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:55.810
Oh, fuck you all.

01:16:55.945 --> 01:16:59.847
[whirs]
Ow, I think I pulled something.

01:16:59.849 --> 01:17:03.184
-[laughs]
-[Pendle] Enough of this shit.

01:17:03.186 --> 01:17:04.385

01:17:05.388 --> 01:17:06.921
You can't make a blunder

01:17:06.923 --> 01:17:09.323
when you mess
with Total Thunder.

01:17:10.393 --> 01:17:12.093
-Is that better now?
-Eh.

01:17:18.968 --> 01:17:20.701
Bingo.

01:17:21.871 --> 01:17:23.771
We're not here to play games,
Alicia.

01:17:24.073 --> 01:17:26.407
My powers have gone, Ray.
She's taken them.

01:17:28.111 --> 01:17:29.276
I've got you.

01:17:30.013 --> 01:17:31.646
No, I won't let her
get away with this.

01:17:31.648 --> 01:17:32.713
Okay, Ray.

01:17:33.216 --> 01:17:35.950
Time to... No.

01:17:36.319 --> 01:17:37.818
I peaked with "bingo".

01:17:45.695 --> 01:17:48.963

you can take a seat.

a little cold there, Ray-Ray.

01:17:56.406 --> 01:17:58.039

01:17:58.875 --> 01:18:01.375
-Ooh.
-[Ray] Heaven, no.

01:18:02.245 --> 01:18:08.182
How about a nice cup of tea?

01:18:08.918 --> 01:18:12.153

01:18:12.422 --> 01:18:13.688
Now...

01:18:14.223 --> 01:18:15.923
time to take out your teeth.

01:18:16.392 --> 01:18:19.126
-[Ted] Alicia.
-Ugh, please.

01:18:20.730 --> 01:18:23.030
Ted, I took your powers.

01:18:23.032 --> 01:18:24.699
What are you gonna do,
bore me to death

01:18:24.701 --> 01:18:25.766
with one of your anecdotes?

01:18:25.768 --> 01:18:28.369
Oh, I don't need
to bore you to death, Alicia.

01:18:29.072 --> 01:18:32.373
You see, nobody can absorb
all our powers and live.

01:18:32.742 --> 01:18:33.974
What are you talking about?

01:18:33.976 --> 01:18:38.012
The toxic cocktail
is destroying you from within.

01:18:40.450 --> 01:18:41.982
-[screams]
-Oh.

01:18:41.984 --> 01:18:43.250
I would go into details

01:18:43.252 --> 01:18:45.419
but I don't think
you'll last that long.

-All right.
-Going. Going.

01:19:32.001 --> 01:19:33.834
Gone. [laughs]

01:19:33.970 --> 01:19:35.169
Shit.

01:19:41.844 --> 01:19:43.210
-[Ray] All right, though?
-[Madera] Yeah.

01:19:45.248 --> 01:19:46.213
[Ray] Well...

01:19:48.017 --> 01:19:49.250
justice is served.

01:19:53.790 --> 01:19:55.790
Hang in there, buddy.
We're gonna get you help.

01:19:56.092 --> 01:19:58.492
-Okay?
-[groans]

01:19:59.428 --> 01:20:01.228
It's no good, Max.

01:20:02.064 --> 01:20:03.197
I'm done.

01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:05.065
No.

01:20:06.135 --> 01:20:07.301
No, no.

01:20:07.303 --> 01:20:09.804
No, goddamn it. Don't you go
dying on me, partner.

01:20:09.806 --> 01:20:11.839
That's right, we're partners.

01:20:13.843 --> 01:20:16.577
I am so sorry
that I treated you...

01:20:17.513 --> 01:20:19.480
like just a sidekick, Ted.

01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:22.183
You're the real hero.

01:20:23.286 --> 01:20:24.485
You're my hero.

01:20:24.987 --> 01:20:27.087
I love you, man. Come on.

01:20:29.492 --> 01:20:32.426
I hate to bring up
a point of logic,

01:20:32.428 --> 01:20:37.431
but if Ted had cancer when
his powers were absorbed,

01:20:37.433 --> 01:20:39.600
the cancer would also have been
sucked out,

01:20:39.602 --> 01:20:44.071
so, wouldn't that mean
that he's fine now?

01:20:44.373 --> 01:20:46.407
-Hmm?
-Good point.

01:20:49.946 --> 01:20:52.213
-[laughs]
-[Ray] Oh.

01:20:52.215 --> 01:20:54.448

in the uncovering

today's not about me.
